[0:32:18] <$LuisKingKing> Apparently people who have tested the game by slowing it down frame by frame have found that if you shoot on the frame the reticule closes fully you get a critical hit every time. Reddit user jpDeathBlade, the user who discovered this, tested it on head shots and he would get head splits every time. Crit shots are essentially “just frames”

[0:37:00] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @CerberusDriver Im pretty sure the events of RE2 happens during her downtime in the Clock Tower
[0:37:00] <+SpartanDumpster> Hold on, if the truck driver came from this gas station, even stopping to get bit, how could Leon and Claire get to Raccoon City before him?
[0:37:02] <rytisone> no Leon doppelganger
[0:37:02] <%TeethMuncher> I didn't see any bites
[0:37:03] <+SenorCounter> The Hamburger bit him

[0:37:03] <+itsjustdoogan> Rob Zombie the truck driver
[0:37:05] <FriendStaffen> There is such a thing as T-virus immunity
[0:37:07] <+Tyler_Ruins_Games> That's not YOUR blood
[0:37:07] <Psykoknight65> I think its just all the protagonists are immune
[0:37:07] <dukenux> In your heeeeead, it's in your heeeeeeeaaaaaad~
[0:37:08] <Cure_Optimism> Cue Sting standing in the middle of the street with a baseball bat

[0:37:10] <bestwaifuritsu> apatCanada Leon, do you have a moment to listen to how you should be fucking my sister?
[0:37:11] <+Thorn14> You can be immune to the T-Virus.

[0:37:12] <Kataguro> Unless you have T Virus Immunity
[0:37:16] <+Kavtech> The car pissed itself.
[0:37:17] <T_sarr> zooooombieeeeee
[0:37:18] <+flustered__> Why does Leon have such good jackets
[0:37:18] <$BioStormX> Maybe Leon and Claire are just slightly more immune to the T Virus, which is why they're some of the only survivors
[0:37:19] <%yuribo26> Don't worry about it
[0:37:19] <+The_UnfathoMarble> Isn't the T-Virus just efficient on 80% of the population?
[0:37:19] <crimsonharvest> ye

[0:37:22] <$Jugg4n4ut> i cant wait to watch the full archive of this
[0:37:22] <reddeadwine1277> Leon took that head to the wheel like a champ son!
[0:37:23] <gravitydazequeen> Isn't Leon immune?
[0:37:24] <Bonbie> That guy in the police station clearly turned way quicker than that
[0:37:24] <ASadFrog> Jill gets infected in RE3
[0:37:25] <Worldbrand> In super metroid's canon, samus pumped her arm constantly like a fucking idiot. But then she saved the animals
[0:37:25] <+Svanyr> Aaaand dead

[0:37:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> Actually dead
[0:37:26] <Ner234> OUCH
[0:37:26] <+W0rldsAStage> outbreak complicates that a little
[0:37:26] <Gruhunchously> Maybe the heroes all have special immunity?
[0:37:26] <+legendfather_of_giants> @WoolieVersus 10% of the pop is immune to the virus
[0:37:27] <%jinking79> unless your Jill
[0:37:27] <superxinvader> the character is infinitely more competent than the player
[0:37:27] <Graxe_> The Outbreak survivors have it even worse. They start infected.

[0:37:36] <ooblagis> T-Virus not having 100% infection rate is canon though
[0:37:36] <+TONYOO101> I thought cannon was that the main characters were freak of nature, one in ten immune people
[0:37:36] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 37 minutes and 38 seconds
[0:37:36] <TopLeftCenter> This tanker explosion is way unrealistically small

[0:37:43] <+DreyfussFrost> Leon is immune thanks to his superior genes.

[0:37:44] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I can't believe Claire is fucking alive

[1:59:49] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 2 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 8oz (240mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[1:59:50] <+WordsHere> It's based on reaching certain points in the stroy
[1:59:50] <ArcticAsylum> Chat shut up Woolie would literally never beat this without a little help
[1:59:51] <+DangerMan83> It's trigger based.
[1:59:52] <%theslippybrit> leon got a chastity belt made of wooden boards. only ada has key
[1:59:53] <DirtyPopcornJ> Leon can't press keycapless buttons but can hammer wooden boards with his gun.
[1:59:57] <ElSteve_TheShyOne> Yo we on RE remake nice, what difficulty is he playing?

[2:01:13] <$angelmorphic> @WoolieVersus The path through the West Office is an objectively better routw
[2:01:14] <+Konquerer> nevermind the still open window
[2:01:15] <vingadivo> cant believe we hit 5k so THIS is the power of super best friends
[2:01:15] <%wolfofsound> Pat is literally here to help woolie, chat freaks the fuck out when he does
[2:01:17] <+Maids4lyfe> zombies keep coming through windows woolie
[2:01:17] <+Azkee> boarded windows = more bullets
[2:01:19] <+C24U> Not True Pat
[2:01:19] <thepiefoot> @DashXero I was under the impression that they only break it if you get close. There is also some scripted ones, like the one from the interrogation room
[2:01:19] <%foreverN2dust> So , skipping the garanteed usefulness for a chance to maybe
[2:01:21] <+ArcanumMBD> There could be ANYTHING at the other windows. There could even be ZOMBIES
[2:01:21] <%theslippybrit> what are you stupid?! thats what the zambehs want you to think!
[2:01:23] <Sloavon> CRAZY TALK
[2:01:24] <prince_ire> I was quoted. <3
[2:01:25] <itouchlads> i think he just wanted a hug
[2:01:25] <BinaryShuffle> Literally the mystery box conversation
[2:01:26] <pshuuu> if i dont board up this window with a zombie, i can board up the other window with a zombie
[2:01:27] <yourliteraldog> Woolie buy a cat you need an animal
[2:01:29] <Stebdavee> First floor windows only
[2:01:31] <+runegod20> but what if you need those wooden board during the final boss
[2:01:31] <+VanaSkiller> @DreyfussFrost LUL
[2:01:32] <$Shotred> is he playing normal mode or easy ?
[2:01:34] <ArtThouBored> X here yet?
[2:01:35] <%DashXero> @thepiefoot Exactly.
[2:01:36] <%PlagueOfGripes> the window boarding system is more useful on a repeat playthrough. not so useful when you have to race through rooms you have never been in to board the windows up before they break in
[2:01:36] <bestwaifuritsu> Which zombie is the one one modeled after dmc Matt?
[2:01:41] <%GohanEgret> @Shotred normal
[2:01:42] <%yuribo26> VapeNation
[2:01:42] <DirtyPopcornJ> Leon punched those nails into the wall with his fists.

[2:01:46] <+BorinCorran> @ArcanumMBD Thank god it's just zombies. I was worried it might be Mormons...
[2:01:46] <laguerrilha> Chat Wollie asked Pat to help, stop freaking out
[2:01:47] <falseeyed> Pat turning this into DS2 LP
[2:01:47] <Mnightshyamallama> I legit didn't know about the 2nd or 3rd zombies because I boarded up every window in all of my playthroughs
[2:01:47] <+Grayhammatter> herbs
[2:01:48] <KeystoneA1> URBS
[2:01:49] <RunningNGunning> CiGrip
[2:01:49] <PSI_Guy95> that dank kush
[2:01:52] <$cureneckbeard> urbs
[2:01:52] <%theslippybrit> are??
[2:01:52] <+CJett92> @ArtThouBored Nah, way too early still
[2:01:53] <thepiefoot> ERB
[2:01:53] <Bonbie> But what if he wants to block the window with no zombies coming through it? That shit's dengerous
[2:01:54] <+DangerMan83> Unlike bullets, there are not enough boards for all relevant windows
[2:01:54] <+RafuEru_Rafunk> Everything is in limited supply
[2:01:55] <SomeDwarf> And there was only one right answer in terms of blocking the windows, because you literally never had to go to that first hallway ever again
[2:01:56] <ShichiNoBushi> 11 herbs and spices.
[2:01:57] <sileo_patronus> erbs

[2:02:47] <Worldbrand> It's both
[2:02:48] <+generalve> LUL I thought Ethan arm repaired because he was infected ?
[2:02:49] <+VektorTroika> Senzu beans only have nutrition for like, ten meals. These herbs can UNDO INJURY
[2:02:50] <+ataxiasuffuse> as if y'all didn't watch woolie just spend like ten minutes overanalyzing if it's the right time to board a window when it's literally placed next to it, pat keep on being pat

[2:02:54] <+RafuEru_Rafunk> I wonder if herb dna was used to make the T virus
[2:02:54] <kiramustdie26> Combine some gerbs, rerbs, and berbs

[2:02:56] <%itsjustdoogan> Magic Evil the game
[2:02:56] <+Sora9567> At this point I'm pretty sure the herbs were contaminated by Umbrella chemicals and it only made the herbs better.
[2:02:57] <MaximumSleep> also the mold, yes.
[2:02:59] <+BorinCorran> @Brother_Coduss Better yet, Jack encourages you to do it.
[2:02:59] <unlimited_osteopath> the herbs in RE4 are not herbs, they're hierbas

[2:03:01] <clonexsniperx> these herbs only heal certain people cause marvin would be alive if they did
[2:03:01] <Lord_Teach> Ethan was infected tho
[2:03:02] <BinaryShuffle> Nanomachines SON!
[2:03:02] <Gruhunchously> Don't worry about it
[2:03:03] <Calek> @MaxonMashville Yamcha eating one after getting impaled and literally having a hole in him disagrees

[2:03:03] <CassyASG> senzu herbs lul
[2:03:04] <Curtis_EB> when does he lose his leg?
[2:03:04] <$GoogleyGareth> I thought that was because of the t-virus?
[2:03:04] <Guardiansaiyan> ITS FINE
[2:03:04] <+HoloToast> Umbrella is a pharmaceutical company in a universe where herbs can cure everything
[2:03:05] <$megamonmon123> its cause he was infected

[2:03:10] <%DashXero> Isn't that because of the infection, though?
[2:03:10] <+WordsHere> It was mainly the mold that let him stick it back on, I think
[2:03:10] <itsjobrotho> I thought it was because he was infected?
[2:03:11] <SnaKemuho> but the zombies counter it though
[2:03:12] <LokimenD> It's pretty much magic honestly
[2:03:12] <%foreverN2dust> woolieMIRIN hey, got some of that RGB herb?
[2:03:14] <KeiPrime> thats cause of evie and the mold tho
[2:03:14] <KeystoneA1> Ethan's lost limbs get reattached partly because of herbs and partly because he's infected with the Mold, which feeds on moisture and nutrients that herbs have
[2:03:14] <%fatal_penguin_> Herbies

[2:06:19] <snow_bush> Angriest Pat, the best man Gilette could get.
[2:06:21] <PayneBlackNG> Also REmake 1 has a mode where boxes are unique
[2:06:21] <Graxe_> There is a mode in REmake that separates each item box as its own inventory.
[2:06:22] <@Menitta> woolieREMEMBERS
[2:06:24] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Umbrella made the box. That's why they are so rich. Fucking created bags of holding with teleportation powers.

[2:40:37] <sea_hamster> I never kill the zombies but I do shoot their legs off.
[2:40:37] <Gruhunchously> @WordsHere I guess an AI would be best at exploiting AI?
[2:40:38] <reiface08> are they playing on ps4 or pc

[2:40:42] <bluefooddye> Pat's street fighting advice
[2:40:43] <+DeaconBluesClues> Woolie will totally do that
[2:40:44] <Kghaleon> Do it, it saves all your ammo
[2:40:46] <+blackkanye> aim for the head though. so they get stunned and can't stand up

[2:40:58] <+TombstoneTTromboners> 1 knife
[2:40:59] <WanderingSwordsman> Hold the 3rd knife in your mouth
[2:41:00] <+Pendragwn> You get an INFINI-DAGGER
[2:41:00] <Sedrelic> a dio handfull
[2:41:01] <+Floofiie> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug You need to assess how you'll traverse the room in the future and whether you wanna spend bullets on the room or not, if it's a wide open room it's better to leg them and just walk around, if it's a narrow corridor it's better to headstun
[2:41:02] <ph3aro> 1. If you don’t move the reticle as you move around 2. Or don’t move around as you go wild with your aiming

[2:59:49] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 3 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 12oz (360mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[2:59:49] <+8framelag> true chris could jump it, but leon **** his sister
[2:59:52] <RainMews> WHITE MEN CAN'T JUMP, WOOLIE!
[2:59:52] <+applefibs> what kind of superhuman legs does woolie have to make that kind of jump?

[3:00:02] <pureticly> get hydrating
[3:00:02] <Gruhunchously> Well, white girls can't jump, it is true.
[3:00:04] <%theslippybrit> leon fought a kraken, let off explosives and incendiaries inside a cabin and avoided the predatory charms of baby ashley, and he cant fucking hop like agent 47?
[3:00:04] <LokimenD> A liver?

[3:00:59] <tri3dgE027> Whoever trained Leon to jump by the time of RE4, deserves a frigging Raise and promotion
[3:01:00] <prince_ire> Does Red Bull count as a form of water for optimal hydration?

[3:03:05] <%QueequegTheater> 3375 combinations @WoolieVersus
[3:03:06] <+Muzzle131> 30 divided by 2 pat means 15
[3:03:08] <$theKittenhugs> 16^3 combinations
[3:03:08] <aiyobro> i brute forced the letter lockers they take like 10 minutes
[3:03:09] <majindusto> Leon: Dammit Chris. If you want it done so badly...Do it yourself!
[3:03:09] <taritari> I GUESS
[3:03:10] <+universboy95> CRAZY
[3:03:11] <$cureneckbeard> 30^3 is only 27,000 combinations
[3:03:12] <LompyArt> How much longer til mr x shows up?
[3:03:14] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Brute Smarts
[3:03:15] <+runegod20> the lockers are at least easy since the letters are super limited
[3:03:17] <zerocruz> I mean CAPcom
[3:03:18] <vingadivo> god i wish they just made a new channel for lps like these
[3:03:19] <BalloniWright> @WoolieVersus remember that zombie you found hanging in the celling, his face model is Matt Walker producer of DMC5

[3:03:32] <%Ion_LaserX> @majindusto Chris: Do I look like a Lannister?
[3:03:32] <+RafuEru_Rafunk> The lockers only take a few minutes to brute force, faster than bringing film back
[3:03:33] <+GuttyGoop> brute forcing the lockers take 3 min max
[3:03:35] <shryoc> brute force os LUL
[3:03:37] <%itsjustdoogan> @LC1997 which enemies though? Fire rounds can kill lickers in 1 or 2, Acid takes 3 or 4
[3:03:37] <+LC1997> Ya the letter lockers are super easy to brute force actually. I did like 2 of them lol
[3:03:37] <%Th3SmartAlec> YEAH PROGRESS
[3:03:38] <+legendfather_of_giants> @WoolieVersus Chat TOLD you both combinations Pat
[3:03:39] <captainthunderwolf> @theslippybrit He spent his time out practicing, Brit! This is him doing his best!

[3:03:45] <+ChiefWilly> roughly 3375 combinations for safes, but the lockers are easily brute forceable i did it for the first 2
[3:03:47] <scrubviewer> this fucker
[3:03:50] <arkv01> man this 30s slow mode is great, we need this shit on all the streams
[3:03:55] <jijipose> DSP had like 36 hours on one scenario
[3:03:56] <+WordsHere> @zerocruz I didn't even think about that. The other is... hmm
[3:03:57] <%theslippybrit> @captainthunderwolf ooh, he's trying!
[3:03:58] <+Jigokuro> Reeeeealy stupid that you can't just give Marvin a first aid spray...
[3:03:58] <aiyobro> 25x5 for the lockers
[3:03:59] <Plutt_bug> My first Leon A run took me almost 9 hours?
[3:03:59] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @JakkukoMAU5 it would appear to be
[3:04:01] <ooblagis> Pat, you didn't brute force either locker. You tried, failed, and gave up, then chat told you the combination LUL
[3:04:01] <ScreamingMeat> combo locks like the ones on Leon's desk aren't hard to figure out if you use a matrix
[3:04:01] <LompyArt> Snailborne reborn
[3:04:06] <gunstar73> The way woolie plays I’ll give him a hard 25
[3:04:06] <+mechslayer71> As if woolie is moving at a normal pace LUL
[3:04:10] <+RC_S3kshun8> just open the safe already and get the comp guys lol
[3:04:11] <Ninja_Kareca> lockers are 125 combinations each, rightM
[3:04:11] <Tampaoster> Not if u change to the original soundtrack
[3:04:13] <+FrostMass22> Snailsborne never left
[3:04:13] <LodiFrostbeard> @WoolieVersus did they vbruteforce a locker or a safe? cuz a safe would take ages
[3:04:16] <%Th3SmartAlec> @LompyArt Oh that's too real
[3:04:17] <+SparkySparkyB00mMan> this is like a way more competent version of a DSP playthrough LUL
[3:04:17] <falseeyed> This is a super chill stream, I like it

[3:22:52] <%GohanEgret> @Corporate_Redeemer the locker? he did
[3:22:52] <%itsjustdoogan> Steel Boy, for all your little boy needs
[3:22:53] <@mothmandraws> 5 barrel
[3:22:56] <scrubviewer> what a well modeled shotgun
[3:22:56] <BayowolfTerra> or the Hydra.
[3:22:57] <mastermidget23> So, gun experts. What's the point of the little pull tab on the end of the underbarrel?
[3:22:57] <gatorafan> The critigun for zombos
[3:22:57] <dukenux> Kappa
[3:23:02] <KeystoneA1> @mik255 All guns in this game are based off real guns or cleverly named after one
[3:23:04] <%Solidnick18> get rid of problems with that
[3:23:04] <ShinobiPhoenix> to be fair, the scepter is probably cheap, or just actually gold, which is soft
[3:23:07] <%Th3SmartAlec> jesus

[3:23:08] <captainthunderwolf> Anyone here played Metro? Six barrels or get out.
[3:23:08] <Corporate_Redeemer> @gohanegret Alright thanks
[3:23:09] <+Remery_> lewd
[3:23:10] <CalderGaming> why does pat have an oral shotgun fixation
[3:23:11] <lbrownthedestroyer> its not as illegal as one either
[3:23:11] <lewdskeletor13> John Marston loves the sawed off
[3:23:12] <%theslippybrit> i got a spray gun for your mouth
[3:23:13] <%blubbins> this isnt DOOM woolie
[3:23:14] <%fFailureatlife> OF COURSE HE WAS
[3:23:14] <+LC1997> Sawed off is over rated, we long bois out here
[3:23:15] <arkv01> nah man I love bullet bukkake on my zombies
[3:23:15] <@Menitta> with a few modifications, you can easily turn one gun into 5 guns!
[3:23:15] <%fattness132> Reload woolie!
[3:23:16] <FracturedImage> Cone of obliteration sounds so metal
[3:23:16] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Ash being wrong is canon.
[3:23:16] <+WordsHere> Put bullets in gun
[3:23:17] <+ghostfarts315> combine the herb with the shotgun!

[3:23:19] <%Ion_LaserX> Ash has a right hand chainsaw he's fine

[3:23:19] <zerocruz> HYDRA THO Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[3:23:19] <Youwereeatenbyalid> WHO?
[3:23:21] <xeros720> you really do want a proper slug, Ash probably used holy buckshot though, so it worked out
[3:23:21] <Piemono> Ash can't hold a full shotgun one handed
[3:23:22] <marvel877> Ash needed a sawed off to move in the basement.
[3:23:23] <nobknee> @WoolieVersus Cool does not help you live longer. Practical helps you live longer.
[3:23:23] <dukenux> Because Pat wants to marry a shotgun
[3:23:23] <ArcticAsylum> You have a PUNISHER SHOTGUN
[3:23:23] <SpydaMan_SLiM> Ash makes up for it with a ChainsSaw hand lol
[3:23:24] <+qdawg2000> fun fact sawd-offs are to hid under your duster
[3:23:24] <+moranprime> Oh man, I wish we got a Ash costume for Leon.
[3:23:24] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yes
[3:23:24] <+Ryallen> How many weapons are in this ga,e?
[3:23:25] <+Bustamente> NOT IF YOU HAVE ONE HAND
[3:23:25] <+runegod20> a sawed off shotgun wouldn't affect the spread though because that doesn't touch the choke
[3:23:26] <vingadivo> of course it is
[3:23:26] <+thebonebard> yea but ash was fighting demons
[3:23:29] <ooblagis> Ash never fought zombies. Ash is killing Deadites and demons. Therefore, SAWED OFF
[3:23:29] <+antibonehurtingjuice> DooM guy dont care
[3:23:31] <Mr_Taters > In ashe's defense he wasn't exactly fighting zombies
[3:23:31] <laguerrilha> A long barrel shotgun is practically a sniper rifle
[3:23:33] <KhonsuII> Ash does everything wrong, that is part of his charm
[3:23:33] <RealPT1> cone of obliteration
[3:23:33] <%theslippybrit> leon please give my sister the spray damage
[3:23:34] <ShichiNoBushi> Put it in.
[3:23:34] <+LoganPayne> did woolie ignore the dpad
[3:23:34] <Corporate_Redeemer> STEELY DAN
[3:23:35] <+Grayhammatter> woolie, use the D-pad
[3:23:36] <skelfae> he didnt fight zombies he fought deadites
[3:23:36] <ThousandDogs> Someone tell Woolie about Slug Rounds.
[3:23:38] <AirlineFood74> 18.1 mm in diameter
[3:23:39] <dukenux> Aww, he looks like a Vault Boy
[3:23:39] <waifoong98> LUL
[3:23:40] <evbites> well ash needed mobility
[3:23:40] <+mik255> STEEL BOI RUN
[3:23:41] <+WordsHere> Trying to do it the old fashioned way, huh?
[3:23:41] <+generalbs123> load a shot gun with one hand bitch
[3:23:43] <%fFailureatlife> more like broken steel boy
[3:23:43] <+President_Miyazaki> Sawed off for better mobility though, also because he's one handing it having it be lighter is nice.
[3:23:44] <+atlasbot1> IT DA BOY
[3:23:44] <%itsjustdoogan> Ash just wanted to catch them all
[3:23:46] <%IDTheftVictim> Resident Evil Ammo names are so good
[3:23:46] <%FriendStaffen> Woolie how the fuck do you remember the classic RE reload system
[3:23:46] <+RaikenTB> can't do it the old way now.
[3:23:47] <CrabSlacks> sawing off the barrel doesn't actually change the accuracy much, it's just a video game thing
[3:23:49] <ThousandDogs> Actually, EVERYONE TELL WOOLIE about Slug rounds.
[3:23:50] <dan_g_v> a boy of Steel
[3:23:50] <rick_deckard_84> Steel Boy, It just works.
[3:23:50] <%UrsulaCat> with a few modifications you can easily completely destroy a gun
[3:23:52] <vingadivo> show woolie the jojo locker
[3:23:53] <dukenux> [Small Guns +20]
[3:23:55] <falseeyed> Strange, I like menu reloads
[3:23:55] <ThousandDogs> Right now. Slug rounds. Spam it.
[3:23:58] <+justianxix> Kreygasm
[3:23:59] <DisGuyOvahEre> insert steel boy into mossberg memewave
[3:24:00] <%Th3SmartAlec> @vingadivo He's seen it
[3:24:00] <+RaikenTB> physical time LUL
[3:24:00] <arkv01> as oppposed to metaphysical time
[3:24:04] <%QueequegTheater> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[3:24:04] <%theslippybrit> leon has turkey gizzards
[3:24:04] <captainthunderwolf> People tend to misunderstand sawed-off shotguns, it's less about spread and more about moving and hiding the gun. It's easier to draw and carry indoors.
[3:24:05] <majindusto> BOY OF STEEL
[3:24:05] <CalderGaming> now I miss the bolt-action reload from RE4
[3:24:06] <copyritetm> he saw and mentioned the jojo locker
[3:24:06] <scrubviewer> leon make like a shotgun to my sister’s womb
[3:24:07] <ThousandDogs> @WoolieVersus You Are Forgetting Slug Rounds
[3:24:08] <+BorinCorran> Ash had to work with what he had. In the ending of AoD he moved up to a lever action.
[3:24:11] <%Th3SmartAlec> Smart oversights
[3:24:14] <+8framelag> same with re5, tech
[3:24:15] <Enryuan> BUT snorting some herbs doesn't take time?
[3:24:15] <DevilDeus13> Ash actually sawed the barrel off in 2 but they forgot after
[3:24:16] <%IDTheftVictim> As opposed to ethereal time
[3:24:17] <Youwereeatenbyalid> THE SMARTEST
[3:24:19] <Evilkaz> HOW LONG IN THE PHYSICAL TIME
[3:24:19] <thepiefoot> @falseeyed I would've loved both, like RE5. But god forbid that RE5 did something right
[3:24:20] <Graxe_> Menu reloading is great in RE5, though.
[3:24:22] <falseeyed> The smartest of oversights
[3:24:22] <%Th3SmartAlec> East side
[3:24:23] <+runegod20> so does leon does hold a shotgun shell between his fingers, what the hell
[3:24:26] <+Louie_Salmon> That's a good oversight right there
[3:24:27] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Fancy hand motion
[3:24:28] <+Muzzle131> you can walk and talk woolie!
[3:24:29] <Cpt_phantom> Healing is still weird

[3:24:31] <+First_Crush> NotLikeThis Christ
[3:24:32] <+RaikenTB> Woolie logic
[3:24:33] <%yuribo26> RELOADS DIDNT EXIST BEFORE
[3:24:38] <OwlLightningMage> LUL
[3:24:39] <DisGuyOvahEre> Pink Steel Boy
[3:24:39] <@Solidus_113> Woolie, you've been reloading your pistol this whole time
[3:24:40] <+mik255> leon was always a reload nerd
[3:24:40] <BraverestWarrior> Reloads didnt exist in 1998
[3:24:41] <%FriendStaffen> In WWII, they had to pause to reload ammo still.
[3:24:41] <%GohanEgret> ocelot reloaded in the HEAT OF BATTLE
[3:24:41] <scrubviewer> fuck gun safety leon
[3:24:42] <Slack_Attack> The inventory reloads in RE 5 are what makes it so fun mechanically
[3:24:43] <AggsMK7> Back when we used muskets
[3:24:43] <+thebonebard> wow that was so genius i didnt even think of it
[3:24:44] <+LC1997> Reloads DIDN'T EXIST in the 90's
[3:24:44] <+8framelag> people love reload animation porn
[3:24:44] <ooblagis> Reloads were the gun dissapearing at the bottom of the screen before popping back up
[3:24:44] <vingadivo> leon was stiol a virgin
[3:24:45] <PayneBlackNG> Until Leon got a bolt action sniper
[3:24:45] <nobknee> 20/20 LOGIC
[3:24:45] <silvcrest> Slam Loading is a thing you all should look up
[3:24:45] <Corporate_Redeemer> Ethan's stump arm reload is still the best
[3:24:48] <%Th3SmartAlec> Why
[3:24:50] <iforgottousername> leon, saw off half your dick so you can get maximum spread on my sisters cooch
[3:24:50] <amiavamp> Guns better than muskets didn't exist until the world gained color
[3:24:51] <trainedtarget> GET CLAIRE
[3:24:51] <%UrsulaCat> leon is a fucking idiot
[3:24:54] <%itsjustdoogan> RE 2 RELOADED
[3:24:54] <@Menitta> ok Im new to this twitch modding thing so bear with me
[3:24:55] <burna_lova> Is there a spoiler chat room? I want to ask a question, but I don't want to spoil anything for Woolie.
[3:24:55] <captainthunderwolf> @DevilDeus13 To be fair, Evil Dead 2 is a weird soft-reboot-sequel of ED1 and most people kind of just forget.
[3:24:57] <ChucklinNarwhal> how fast can you reload in the frozen time?
[3:24:57] <@Menitta> plus drunk
[3:24:57] <falseeyed> DROP YOUR GUN. No reloading.
[3:24:57] <trainedtarget> GET
[3:24:57] <Graxe_> Reloads happened when only when you were completely out back then.
[3:25:01] <Bonbie> So reloads got cooler as people got less sexual? So guns stole all the arousal?
[3:25:01] <%UrsulaCat> leon is a himbo
[3:25:02] <%fFailureatlife> woolie and i live in completely separate worlds

[3:28:50] <ebonifragaria> BibleThump
[3:28:50] <+runegod20> and it's a sawed off shotgun which cops uses because it can still be fairly accurate and the small size makes it easier to use indoors since it doesn't get stuck on shit

[3:28:51] <lethallylactic> LUL
[3:28:52] <kresnikhama> but it looks cool

[3:49:51] <WotanCR> Jake is Dino
[3:49:52] <Worldbrand> That's a good name
[3:49:52] <falseeyed> Jake x Sherry is nice.
[3:49:52] <CptBritches> He is a really boring design tbh
[3:49:53] <disister1201> The fgc needs to ban the boring stuff just like smash Kappa
[3:49:53] <AirlineFood74> Jake's cool, he has a good character arc
[3:49:54] <+crown_clown22> Wassup Woolie and Pat!

[4:10:43] <+Taglog7> I hope woolie enjoys his new permanent pat couch indent
[4:10:44] <+Implosivestar> Guts ruining twink fights off undead

[4:11:14] <%ssjklyco> opened one
[4:11:15] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Go through the door.
[4:11:20] <buddahdisciple> Hi pat and Woolie
[4:11:22] <%itsjustdoogan> Claire's sex tape is in Leon and Chris's desk
[4:11:25] <DracaenaLeaf> Yaaaooooooooooooo

[4:11:28] <%sukiyakiwestern> DONT DO IT
[4:11:28] <Kghaleon> You never need to come here again
[4:11:30] <+thebonebard> @laguerrilha ive killed many one hit with mouth grenades
[4:11:32] <mutmc> 🚫🏚
[4:11:32] <falseeyed> Elliot?
[4:11:33] <%yuribo26> Oh hey, this was RE2 stream, I forgot
[4:11:34] <fmbboaventura> Is this on normal?
[4:11:36] <rhus> "please Leon, ruin my sister's guts"
[4:11:37] <Djinnazz> that was useless.
[4:11:38] <+LogothX> Claire's sex tape is just her petting Albert Whiskers
[4:11:39] <$ooblagis> It's what's his face, the dead cop
[4:11:40] <alexandrecau> Woolie's choice, which window goes to patschwitz
[4:11:41] <GeneralHysterics> Being used to Pat's elite gamer decision making, this is a cool contrast.
[4:11:41] <reiju_22> elliot
[4:11:49] <+Griffin1171> you had a space, tho
[4:11:49] <CrunchyFinn> Gotta let it out! Gotta let it out!!

[4:11:51] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> He moved.
[4:11:52] <TsunTsuchinoko> gotta get it out
[4:11:52] <+without_borders> Is it still canon that Leon was a day light from getting drunk and over sleeping?
[4:11:52] <+Opal_Overture> THE BEST FRIENDS RISE AGAIN!
[4:11:53] <%sukiyakiwestern> oh no, the lever.....
[4:11:53] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Uhhh, is he not dead?
[4:11:54] <+xx123manxx> its the door zombie in the shutter room
[4:11:54] <laguerrilha> At least the animation of the scraps from the grenade cutting the zombies around is cool looking
[4:11:56] <Ya_boi_wally > Albert Whiskers is the best thing to come out of that meme
[4:11:57] <nepwar> Leon rearrange my sisters guy to make room for da baby
[4:12:00] <DarkKnightGrave> GOTTA LET IT OUT
[4:12:00] <natebud> That is a very good window to board because Leon has to got to the break room later
[4:12:03] <+tymetak> "Please stir up Claires insides"
[4:12:04] <GeneralHysterics> HIT THE LEVER
[4:12:04] <+MechaBaphomet> They were indeed ruined
[4:12:05] <Pookiedaexzile> Mr. X will tear down any of Woolies Backwalls
[4:12:06] <nobknee> @WoolieVersus Hey, you should play KOTOR 2. If not on stream, at least your free time. Steam has an excellent, up-to-date version.

[4:13:31] <+Dovakhin573> Nothing because ADA ALL THE WAY
[4:13:31] <%QueequegTheater> @ToneBacas Claire would have to not want to fuck Leon for him to be interested

[4:15:47] <overlordkog> Has Woolie been clued into bobble-heads yet?
[4:15:55] <%LiterACola90> You can combine items without picking them up. IE if you have gunpowder and find more gunpowder you can combine them without picking up the second gunpowder.
[4:15:56] <ElenaManetta> i hope pat gets home okay and woolie doesn't make him go home in the freezing snow like pat did to fuggins

[4:16:48] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> You could put away the healing spray
[4:16:49] <+NWR_James> So many saves
[4:16:49] <%Ion_LaserX> SAVIOR OF THE UNIVERSE
[4:16:49] <batman_von_suparman> Leon and claire would make beautiful babies tho
[4:16:51] <%MisterCrimson> ah yes, 4 gig saves
[4:16:52] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Leon. This is Chris. I need you to fuck my sister, Claire.
[4:16:52] <+Grayhammatter> yes
[4:16:53] <SkewerSTARSTREAM> Oh God... not to send people away from the stream, but Max is about to try out Apex Legends...
[4:16:54] <laguerrilha> YEs, later
[4:17:00] <nepwar> rotate your saves
[4:17:09] <+VoidHaunter> At least both of these key items are done soon
[4:17:10] <$Louie_Salmon> There is always a point to rotating your saves.
[4:17:10] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Leon, you can't run, Leon. Fuck my sister.
[4:17:11] <VritraReiRei> 4 Gigs of savefiles LUL
[4:17:13] <falseeyed> That is my fear
[4:17:15] <%tank7013> Damn all those saves. That's like 4 and a half gigs down the drain Kappa
[4:17:15] <+RaikenTB> that's why you gotta get good
[4:17:16] <%SilvaChariot0133> Whoops all ammo
[4:17:17] <+shaderichter_belmont> you can do it with one slot,
[4:17:19] <+paladinstarbuster> like max
[4:17:19] <+antibonehurtingjuice> You have to be IGN level of bad
[4:17:21] <+SpamKingRathalos> yep, nothing like runnin through an area with one bullet
[4:17:21] <PSI_Guy95> game over is a failure of the game designer
[4:17:23] <overlordkog> @xx123manxx Ahh, right, right. Woolie's blind af so that should be fun...

[4:17:33] <OkamiDude15> @SkewerSTARSTREAM didnt he try it out last stream after he did the monhun stuff?
[4:17:36] <+Dingus_Tickler> This game is impossible if you’re Matt atpRtsd
[4:17:38] <%QueequegTheater> TOFU META
[4:17:40] <UnknownGerm> I did that in RE4, I played through on professional rewriting my save each time. I got bricked on a boss when I had no ammo.
[4:17:45] <+SpaciousWheat> Oh I already like the A and B system in ths game
[4:17:46] <%GarbageNirvana> Doesn't ammo just start spawning out of nowhere in boss fights
[4:17:48] <+LogothX> Its like what we like to call "Paige Proof"
[4:17:52] <DarkKnightGrave> Tofu is the Meta.
[4:17:54] <lloyddboy> CLOSET

[4:18:01] <Rngiddion> the closet

[4:18:10] <Sapphire_Breeze> @GarbageNirvana usually they have just enough in the arena except, I think, Claire's final boss
[4:18:12] <+Muzzle131> what about Leon and Helena soggyH Kappa
[4:18:13] <Bonbie> Leon's final boss is borderline RNG without items, so it
[4:18:16] <dragonsfay3r> X is fresh out of prison and ready to give it to ya.
[4:18:21] <nepwar> LUL
[4:18:21] <$Louie_Salmon> @unknowngerm Everyone learns their lesson one a game, and then never ever makes that mistake again.
[4:18:23] <%king_wragles> @Trinity5 do you mean UNassisted?
[4:18:30] <+thebonebard> @atlasbot1 x has not given it to him

[4:34:32] <Ignitus95> to be fair to woolie my first playthrough i tossed no key items, but just as momentos

She keeps buying cats, Leon. So many cats. She named the newest one "Albert Whiskers." I can't live like this, Leon. You need to go balls-deep in my baby sister. Do it for your buddy Chris, Leon.

[4:36:14] <$Louie_Salmon> @swindlefed I dunno, if I got so good that the game could no longer stop me I would be disappointed. Lowering the difficulty dynamically seems wrong though, if someone sucks they have to git gud
[4:36:14] <+BorinCorran> @CanonHusbando Hard to forget that.
[4:36:15] <%sukiyakiwestern> AHHHHHHHHH
[4:36:19] <%Th3SmartAlec> I can't handle that Woolie prioritizes boards over key items

[4:36:23] <%yuribo26> @dmdyne99 nope

[4:36:35] <nepwar> I am surprised the Mr. X hasn't gotten a funko pop yet
[4:36:36] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Leon, Ada will never love you. My sister Claire, on the other hand, will. Look at her ass, Leon. Not that I do, that would be weird, but you're allowed, Leon. I bestow upon thee that ass, as my fellow RPD officer and good friend. Leon, you need to fuck Claire.
[4:36:36] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @Ariksgabs damn, I'mma steal that too
[4:36:40] <@Menitta> b4 I go tho
[4:36:40] <Gruhunchously> Earning the interest of Claire is a death sentence basically. Unless you're Leon.

And yet he still met only one man worthy of Claire, “You want my sister? You can have her! I left everything you need, Together at my place. Now you just have to fuck her! ”

[4:37:51] <dunkledubs> Watch out for Big Shark LEon
[4:37:51] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Leon. I know where you live and I know where you sleep. I have been training 7 days a week, 12 hours a day punching boulders to prepare for this. You WILL fuck Claire, Leon. If I have to break your legs and tie you to the bed, so be it. This is your only warning.

[4:39:54] <ARBITERWARPIG> Kendo?
[4:39:56] <machshop> it's a 9 volt
[4:39:59] <+JingleBerryMan> Remember that time that Claire had the hots for that guy in Rev 2
[4:39:59] <%yuribo26> Good ol' AAs
[4:40:01] <+thewaifoo> i shot the c4 too
[4:40:01] <fruit_pie_the_magician> 9 volt jesus
[4:40:02] <Tha_Mik> steal it
[4:40:05] <+ChiefWilly> These kids never seen a 9-volt, chat babs
[4:40:06] <PhantomMaskJr> klinkLurk
[4:40:07] <vingadivo> if chris fucks claire himself it will guarantee that the redfield lineage remains pure.
[4:40:08] <alwayspronking> It needs a "Leon pls fuck my sister" battery.
[4:40:08] <Gruhunchously> Haven't you learned the basics of CQC?
[4:40:10] <subjectg> C4 is very, very stable
[4:40:10] <%Ion_LaserX> Of course you can buy it at the corner store this is AMERICA
[4:40:12] <Pookiedaexzile> here it comes get the song ready
[4:40:13] <LunarLancaster> Leon's fetish for being cucked by Ada is the only thing that fuels him to be the cool, sexy man we all love.
[4:40:14] <evbites> resident evil 9 featuring Nero from the devil may cry series
[4:40:14] <%foreverN2dust> those proprietary c4 detonator batteries are where they make all the profit
[4:40:17] <KatabolicRage> I think c4 is detonated by running an electrical charge through it or something
[4:40:18] <faegbeard> C4 is super stable it's like fucking magic
[4:40:19] <+Dives__> C4 needs a blasting cap to detonate
[4:40:19] <+chaumiester> You can shoot C3, that will blow up by shooting it
[4:40:21] <rytisone> Rush Hour 2 fake confirmed
[4:40:22] <+Typhaeon> 9 volt wouldn't have contacts on the bottom
[4:40:23] <rabidmonkey32> No pat the whole point of c4 is boom
[4:40:24] <DarkKnightGrave> @falseeyed That is too much badass woman in one room. All dicks would explode.
[4:40:27] <LiquidMathew> pretty sure i heard you can even burn c4 and it won't explode
[4:40:28] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:40:29] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Leon, I will tell you what battery you need if you fuck my sister Claire and save the Redfield bloodline.
[4:40:29] <%QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus The fact that C4 is INCREDIBLY stable is the entire reason it is so malleable
[4:40:31] <SGrim> @vingadivo chris' balls don't work due to steriods.
[4:40:31] <+Muzzle131> These characters have terrible lives always having to fight biological weapons
[4:40:32] <+ChiefWilly> you could use c4 as a fleshlight so long as you dont apply an electric current
[4:40:32] <$cureneckbeard> I guess that's the advantage of C4 over C3. More stable
[4:40:33] <zerocruz> Fuck 9-volt tho
[4:40:36] <illogik01> go board some more windows
[4:40:37] <%LethargicRush> c3?
[4:40:39] <fruit_pie_the_magician> C4. the explosive that can only be detonated by other explosives
[4:40:41] <nademonkey1100> honestly ypu cant shoot it to make it go off needs heat and pressure
[4:40:41] <$Louie_Salmon> @chaumiester Man when's C5 coming out
[4:40:41] <+Keyd00d> I can't wait until X forces Woolie to think on his feet
[4:40:41] <Pygmalionic> I like how we've come full circle to DMC5 running on an engine built for RE.
[4:40:45] <+Onani_Master> oh, he just went backwards for some reason
[4:40:45] <Laecerelius> Never heard of C3 before
[4:40:47] <+Griffin1171> Experimental explosive from the west
[4:40:47] <nepwar> C2 will explode just by looking at it funny
[4:40:49] <SkewerSTARSTREAM> You can mold it into a butterfly and toss it around!
[4:40:49] <+gael_jebidibah> A good sequel
[4:40:49] <laguerrilha> I would be scared if the timer was broken and immediately went off when i set the timer
[4:40:49] <ARBITERWARPIG> Where's our C4 butterfly
[4:40:50] <+BorinCorran> @LunarLancaster being a starcrossed lover actually makes Leon stronger, that's why his kicks are so powerful.
[4:40:50] <+antibonehurtingjuice> Im waiting for the sequel C5
[4:40:50] <majindusto> C4 is Superior
[4:40:50] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @ChiefWilly RC vehicles were the drones of 90's
[4:40:52] <%Th3SmartAlec> Ah. C3, that experimental explosive from the West
[4:40:53] <+Sighden> we don't talk about cs and c1...

[4:41:02] <PinkSocks> Nemmy
[4:41:02] <+CanonHusbando> C5 just never explodes
[4:41:02] <WotanCR> NEMESIS
[4:41:02] <nepwar> C1 was just a grenade
[4:41:03] <+moranprime> I'd love to see how games are made on the RE Engine.
[4:41:03] <Mr_Strut> It's why dynamite went out of vogue
[4:41:03] <snatchr5> ssssshtars
[4:41:03] <pillowwasp> C1 explodes on creation
[4:41:03] <SlimJhm> you can put C4 in a skillet and it won't blow up
[4:41:05] <Fujiwara_92> Whens c5
[4:41:05] <low_hell_key> we dont talk about C1
[4:41:06] <Brandon__Brando> ya c4 changed some shit
[4:41:07] <Deadxxdead> nemesis was in there

[4:41:23] <Who_lio42> c5 can explode twice
[4:41:23] <lewdskeletor13> RE3 PogChamp
[4:41:23] <Ir_ramble> and C5 is inert because it didn't get a Red Bull Sponsorship
[4:41:24] <+RC_S3kshun8> C4 can even be burned/used as a firestarter/camping fuel. It will only be detonated by a smaller explosion.
[4:41:24] <Pygmalionic> Reminder that D4 will never ever be finished.
[4:41:25] <%yuribo26> People who don't know C3 getting exposed that they didn't play MGS3

[4:41:28] <Tgsnum5> Stttttttttaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrssssssssssssssssss
[4:41:29] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Leon, you need to blow my sister Claire's hymen apart like a well-placed and properly-ignited charge of C4.
[4:41:30] <mastermidget23> C1 actually explodes BEFORE you mix its ingredients. C2 fixed that.
[4:41:30] <%PhantomThief117> God, Mr. X is gonna have an absolute field day with Woolie's anus.
[4:41:32] <+CanonHusbando> C7 is what powers the autoblow
[4:41:33] <%Ion_LaserX> It's almost like a NEMESIS was roaming around here
[4:41:33] <Videogamer4> C50 creates black holes
[4:41:35] <nepwar> C0 was an attack from an enemy stando
[4:41:36] <Gruhunchously> September was just an unlucky month from 1997-2001ish
[4:41:37] <zeroraider> C5 only explodes when you tweet out a different opinion
[4:41:37] <%Freelance7> He got the valve, right?
[4:41:38] <%LethargicRush> are zombies born fat? or do they die fat?
[4:41:38] <OwlLightningMage> It was almost like there was a Christ punching his way to Leon to get him to impregnate Claire LUL
[4:41:40] <Corporate_Redeemer> What about D4C??
[4:41:41] <prince_ire> Silly Woolie, the fatties weren't zombified at all. They're just hungry
[4:41:43] <CptBritches> C5 will fuck Claire and give her a child
[4:41:43] <cizal11> what
[4:41:44] <LunarLancaster> Claire needs that meat inside her

[4:41:50] <Geno4344> bloated zombies that explode when you shoot them would be lovely
[4:41:50] <+Nomicro4u> The Virus is alive
[4:41:53] <Prevot> so they're not zombies?
[4:41:54] <+SolidusRex> C6 only explodes when you take it out to dinner first.
[4:41:55] <KatabolicRage> it's a viral type zombie, rather than magical undead raising
[4:41:55] <captainthunderwolf> Yeah, zombies are technically organically alive.

[5:04:30] <+SimplesRock> @harrydeans_hawaiian_shirt this is a guess from UE4, but I would assume there are just two layers (or more) of texture to create gore effect, especially since a lot of the enemies have stuff like ribs and bones that seem fully modeled beneath their “skin”
[5:04:31] <captwolfaroo> Use square to combine, Woolie. You'll save milliseconds.
[5:04:37] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Allegedly these lickers were RFD (raccoon fire department) who got fucked by all the fires
[5:04:38] <Slack_Attack> They are not in RE 5\
[5:04:38] <DrkJP520> Yellow not in remake
[5:04:38] <Graxe_> Oh right. Woolie wouldn't know about blue since 4 and 5 doesn't have blue herbs.

[5:05:03] <alexandrecau> The Lickers (リッカー rikkā?) is a result of a further mutation in Zombies infected with certain strains of t-Virus. This process is known as V-ACT. Lickers are noted for their large, exposed brains, lack of skin and eyes, extreme sensitivity to sound and their eponymous tongues.[1]

[5:06:38] <majindusto> Im also disappointed that the cut enemies from 1.5 like Man-Spiders didn't get to finally return
[5:06:39] <artoflec> The V-ACT in universe is that sudden adrenaline jolt or whatever your body does when it thinks its dying. The experiment on zombies and make their bodies have the response, this exacerbates the G-Virus and turns them into Lickers.

[5:10:16] <+paladinstarbuster> Woolie
[5:10:16] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Probably should have stood behind that wall or some type of cover maybe. Just maybe
[5:10:17] <GeneralHysterics> he DIDN'T HEAR THE ZAMBO SOUND

[5:10:23] <captainthunderwolf> @Calek Yeah, I saw that in Crowbcat's video.
[5:10:24] <%PlagueOfGripes> [ Pat awaits the garbage encounter ]

[5:10:26] <mastermidget23> If you stand within the same BUILDING as that much c4 in real life, you're going to end up as ground beef.
[5:10:28] <subjectg> I’m pretty sure the shrapnel would cause serious injury but...
[5:10:28] <%Ariksgabs> and people thought Shaggy is invincible
[5:10:29] <+antibonehurtingjuice> GO LET IT GO

[5:15:21] <$cureneckbeard> Woolie worked it out
[5:15:23] <SomeDwarf> If you leave the room before the explosion happens the bookcase stays up
[5:15:24] <+xx123manxx> speedrun tips run to library so bookcase can fuck off
[5:15:25] <subjectg> This is exactly how XCOM rookies shoot too
[5:15:25] <laguerrilha> We saw it and heard it
[5:15:27] <faegbeard> 20/20
[5:15:27] <+thebonebard> well the shotgun served his purpose
[5:15:27] <+8framelag> unless you know the tech
[5:15:27] <+sungkyoo> you can totally get out though
[5:15:27] <ToastyBroDude> sigh
[5:15:28] <IdiotWithADHDGamer> 1st Birkin is best taken down with pistol anyways
[5:15:29] <joylent_blue> i didn't see it 😡
[5:15:30] <falseeyed> Girls saw it Woolie
[5:15:31] <%Th3SmartAlec> He's Paiging through this super hard
[5:15:32] <nepwar> special eyes
[5:15:32] <Graxe_> But if you go into the library before the explosion happens, the bookcase doesn't fall over because that would be annoying.
[5:15:33] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:15:34] <+BorinCorran> It's fine. Birkin is easier with the pistol imo. They shower you in Handgun rounds.

[5:26:42] <sennoh> use em if you got em
[5:26:42] <natebud> 1 zombie vs. 1 room of zombies, choose your grenade use wisely
[5:26:43] <sea_hamster> I just save nades for the bosses

[5:26:57] <CrunchyFinn> I'd say use Flash as defense, use the Hand Grenade while the enemy's dazed.
[5:26:58] <ebonifragaria> Step 1: be good; Step 2: don't be bad

[5:27:44] <Fujiwara_92> Like ProZD says "but i only 85 of them"
[5:27:46] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> @lvl100_charizard You’d think flashbangs would leave both parties unsatisfied.

[5:40:48] <%wolfofsound> so suck at the game just enough to take advantage?
[5:40:56] <+8framelag> no wonder 2nd to last version takes forever, go into the fight with just a knife

[5:41:01] <%radda343> @angriestpat boss health scales to how much ammo you have
[5:41:01] <+deVaras> or just stab him with the knife alot
[5:41:05] <$SilverRoddo> Claire is preg?
[5:41:06] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @CptBritches
[5:41:07] <%jinking79> and all u needed was only two to three knife to kill him
[5:41:08] <Zojobo> If you suck enough, the game forgives you for being a weak baby.
[5:41:08] <CrypticMochi> Suck enough for BIG damage
[5:41:09] <GeneralHysterics> I love how we can just accuse woolie of benefiting from adaptive difficulty no matter what
[5:41:11] <%Freelance7> SEE LEON? CLAIRE CAN BE A GOOD MOM

[5:41:20] <+sungkyoo> Pump it Kreygasm
[5:41:24] <+Muzzle131> Chris saw Claire take care of Sherry and was like she NEEDS to be a mom!

[5:41:31] <%FistOfMonkey> YOU A SOCK
[5:41:35] <$cureneckbeard> hi knife
[5:41:36] <+ssulcer> So is the speed run of this fight going to be coming in with one bullet and one shoting him?
[5:41:36] <+Sighden> You know who's eye Leon would never pump into? Claire's
[5:41:43] <falseeyed> Yeah, I got the knife back too last night
[5:41:44] <DeltaD36> it's fine
[5:41:47] <MelBrooksKA> It's fine
[5:41:49] <Laecerelius> Game rewards you for either sucking or being ballsy and not bringing much ammo
[5:41:51] <%Th3SmartAlec> Gottem
[5:41:52] <+Hamblasto> Cleared out boss arena. Still walks
[5:41:53] <+WutangchickeN> while you were playing this I got motivated to play and beat Claire a on hardcore without using the item box...
[5:41:55] <GeneralHysterics> "it wasn't a reload"
[5:41:55] <%wolfofsound> @RedDragonMoth y'know I never played these games so I took pat at his word to HOARD, but yeah I may have to do his side A over
[5:41:57] <HyperionXV> The speedrun of the fight is using the knife and killing him in 30 seconds
[5:41:59] <dungpie64> I didn't get my grenade back when i beat him
[5:41:59] <%krispen_wa> Selene: Herbs? Ah, for making ale.
[5:42:01] <%itsjustdoogan> in soviet russia, beware the communism
[5:42:01] <mastermidget23> So how badly does carrying around, say, the infinite ammo samurai edge or the infinite knife, fuck up the adaptive difficulty?
[5:42:10] <CrypticMochi> Speed run is knife the ever living shit out of him
[5:42:18] <cisealnine> Is it just me or is Woolie's audio is better than usual?
[5:42:25] <midnightmile> Knife strats only work on 120fps

[5:43:07] <GeneralHysterics> Pay to win
[5:43:09] <$SilverRoddo> I believe Woolie's audio is better, because he switched over to Linux?
[5:43:10] <Lord_of_all_Edges> You are already dead.
[5:43:10] <captwolfaroo> PC games were a mistake
[5:43:12] <turf_wind_and_fire> FRAMERATESSSSSSS
[5:43:13] <Zojobo> Yeah, cause it's how many frams the knife is in them I guess.
[5:43:13] <%masneo2> unlocked framerate knife is so op
[5:43:14] <falseeyed> PC Cheater Race!
[5:43:14] <+subdude_> So that's why the framerate is listed on speedruns.
[5:43:15] <CrabSlacks> what is this, fallout 76?
[5:43:18] <Run44forrest> vergil mode?
[5:43:19] <Gruhunchously> PC games were a mistake
[5:43:19] <Prevot> it's the year of the lord 2019 and devs still tie things to framerate
[5:43:19] <+ThatGuyfromMars> Tofu survivor would be trivial with that FPS thing
[5:43:20] <%sukiyakiwestern> One's a bullet the others a physical OBJECT pat
[5:43:21] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Probably time knife spends connecteD?
[5:43:22] <MelBrooksKA> That's not really weird
[5:43:23] <+sungkyoo> But why though?
[5:43:23] <+Typhaeon> It clearly draws a line
[5:43:24] <Shrcker> item
[5:43:25] <ShichiNoBushi> Each frame of the slashing animation deals damage?
[5:43:27] <+President_Miyazaki> Does that mean the knife is worse on console?
[5:43:29] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie was really wanting to not look at that room
[5:43:30] <JDebss> That's a fun bug at least
[5:43:30] <Pookiedaexzile> who else is just here for dmx
[5:43:33] <%FistOfMonkey> Fuck this game FlipThis TableHere
[5:43:35] <ToastyBroDude> @President_Miyazaki yes
[5:43:35] <Ninja_Kareca> i assume because guns are hitscan and the knife needs to pass through their hitboxes
[5:43:36] <+8framelag> word of advice use knives next time it works better for encounters
[5:43:36] <midnightmile> @President_Miyazaki yup
[5:43:36] <claireredfield555> Wait do you hear that?
[5:43:36] <+skizzuto> makes sense, knife probably does damage for each frame it's connecting with an enemy model
[5:43:37] <ToneBacas> dark souls 2 weapon durability on PC all over again
[5:43:38] <+deVaras> @President_Miyazaki yes it is worse
[5:43:38] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:43:38] <+GenoaLow> There is exactly enough ammo and resources in every RE to kill every enemy
[5:43:40] <$theKittenhugs> You sure can tell it's 1 AM where they're at Keepo
[5:43:42] <%itsjustdoogan> wouldnt the frames damage the knife faster
[5:43:47] <illogik01> broke the glass door
[5:43:47] <CampinSteve> X Gon give it to ya WHAT!
[5:43:48] <+sungkyoo> !uptime
[5:43:48] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 5 hours and 43 minutes
[5:43:50] <%BasiliskEye84> Japanese devs like tying things to framerates, I do not know why.
[5:43:55] <+BorinCorran> @Pookiedaexzile I don't think X is going to show up tonight.
[5:43:58] <+xx123manxx> DMC isnt for another hour and a half woolie time so prolly not tonight @Pookiedaexzile
[5:43:59] <maegra> It does more damage but the durability wastes faster on regular knives
[5:44:00] <+dickbuttwoman> G loves big balls
[5:44:01] <%Th3SmartAlec> Yeah, about that....
[5:44:02] <forlorncarton> G virus Demands eyeballs
[5:44:03] <+Muzzle131> were almost to our gentleman in a hat!
[5:44:03] <LunarLancaster> Almost every game with a melee weapon has the weapon's damage tied to how many frames it is colliding with something
[5:44:04] <zerocruz> 3 am where I live LUL
[5:44:04] <+ChiefWilly> Birkin is full on Bloodborne
[5:44:05] <Mnightshyamallama> he doesn't know the reference
[5:44:06] <GeneralHysterics> Woolie, you know NOTHING about Birkin's eyes
[5:44:07] <ToastyBroDude> @BorinCorran Probably not
[5:44:07] <falseeyed> Nemmy
[5:44:08] <+Eddy21forsaken> he means at the title screens of each RE game
[5:44:08] <ShichiNoBushi> Puppy-dog eyes.
[5:44:10] <Prevot> so the G virus turns you into a Zelda boss
[5:44:10] <prince_ire> The only solution is more eyeball
[5:44:12] <majindusto> Markiplier took out 4th form Birkin with a Knife
[5:44:16] <Rock_Monstor> Birkin Balls for days
[5:44:20] <lethallylactic> A G
[5:44:21] <CampinSteve> SUFFER LIKE G DID
[5:44:22] <rad_dude123465> The eye motif with the G virus is really cool
[5:44:25] <Objurgo> A real G
[5:44:25] <Luvinsus> Remember when Vanquish was ported? Where the damage you took was tied to your framerate as well? @WoolieVersus
[5:44:27] <+8framelag> birkin was creepier in re2 since the eye sound effect
[5:44:27] <JDebss> Big dick G
[5:44:27] <%yuribo26> MAN SHAPED Kreygasm
[5:44:28] <energywarning> G for gee i sure love eyeballs
[5:44:28] <%TeethMuncher> Ain't nothing but a g thing
[5:44:28] <+nutgoth> The G is for goop
[5:44:29] <GeneralHysterics> wait, Birkin's OG
[5:44:29] <+EVOriginal> Same ol' G
[5:44:29] <Pookiedaexzile> so x isnt gonna give it to us
[5:44:29] <ebonifragaria> the "G" stands for glare
[5:44:30] <Corporate_Redeemer> A REAL G
[5:44:31] <%sukiyakiwestern> YOULL NEVER GET YOUR HANDS ON THE G
[5:44:32] <BurdRightsActivist> @zerocruz Nova Scotia?
[5:44:33] <Pygmalionic> Knife on final boss is speedrun tech
[5:44:34] <ToastyBroDude> G SHAPE
[5:44:35] <tyrano_the_wise> GG ;D
[5:44:35] <fruit_pie_the_magician> A straight G
[5:44:35] <SixthSun2> The T Pose Type
[5:44:36] <natebud> Birkin becomes man shaped eventually
[5:44:36] <+President_Miyazaki> Also G is just way cooler.
[5:44:37] <+dickbuttwoman> G stands for "Golgatha", woolie.
[5:44:38] <NovaKnightmare> G is regeneration T is toughness
[5:44:38] <zeroraider> man shapedLUL
[5:44:39] <Plague_bagel> g is also my creation
[5:44:39] <%itsjustdoogan> the G spot
[5:44:40] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Birkin has cooler forms
[5:44:40] <Dull_Fangs> G IS MY CREATION
[5:44:41] <cisealnine> The G Virus has eyes and the T virus have a thing with outer organs, if I recall correctly.
[5:44:41] <ToneBacas> @BasiliskEye84 because they max out consoles and/or lock fps in those, so it's more manageable
[5:44:42] <Onyx_Parasaur> G for Goo
[5:44:42] <CrunchyFinn> Putting off my S+ run to watch Woolie and Pat tackle RE2. How far will they go tonight?
[5:44:42] <+Darastrix> Suffer like G did?
[5:44:42] <zerocruz> Nah Chile
[5:44:43] <prince_ire> The G-Vrirus gives you eyes on the outside
[5:44:43] <wsintai> G for Giorno

[5:44:44] <low_hell_key> T POSE MASTER RACE
[5:44:44] <beercules12> welcome to the crazy lore of RE woolie
[5:44:44] <DSD24> Isn't it because the Movie
[5:44:46] <%Cavumentum> Surely he suffers as G did
[5:44:47] <+thecosmicfly> G-Whiz Tyrant
[5:44:48] <$ooblagis> G is Tetsuo morphing
[5:44:50] <InfiniteSwagbito> @itsjustdoogan Yes. I'm on PC, and do the low-resolution 300+fps thing for speedruns. Knife does way more damage but breaks way faster
[5:44:50] <dan_g_v> so, Pat is going to sleep in the couch while Woolz plays the night away, right?
[5:44:53] <%masneo2> I think they designed the framerate that way solely because console
[5:44:53] <mastermidget23> @WoolieVersus The G Stands for Googly Eyes.
[5:44:54] <%TeethMuncher> A real human people
[5:44:55] <Sarumarine> Former-People
[5:44:55] <SomeDwarf> I dunno if Nemesis was a person

[5:44:58] <Ninja_Kareca> Gangsta-Virus
[5:44:59] <Fujiwara_92> a people
[5:45:00] <+xx123manxx> T stands for These organs are on the outside - G stands for God damn my eyes are dry
[5:45:00] <+Bad1uck> That other 25% tho....
[5:45:00] <caol2017> the GOUGI-VIRUS
[5:45:00] <Hammatime8> Nirkin has the I virus Kappa
[5:45:02] <RossMirage> One virus is a mutator, other virus is an enhancer.
[5:45:02] <GeneralHysterics> Three quarters of his body is people...for now...
[5:45:03] <cumurasame> plz tell woolie about how t+G changes gender, how V virus gives Alicia a plant dick
[5:45:05] <Graxe_> "Suffer like G did" takes on an entirely different meaning in the context of Birkin.

[5:51:03] <CampinSteve> It has the same system as resident evil 4. The worse you do the more ammo you get.
[5:51:04] <$theKittenhugs> It would be weird to go back from adaptive since they've been using it for RE games since RE4

[6:07:30] <+WaiL_FiN> @crypticmochi YES
[6:07:32] <waifoong98> Joseph shitederson, he and Hbomber knows jack shit
[6:07:34] <Darkfire346> Baldur 1 is the best when you first play it cause SUPLEX
[6:07:35] <@mothmandraws> inb4 podcast guest on monday
[6:07:35] <vonmaultke> Joesph Anderson is POGGERS
[6:07:36] <+enterprise900> Joseph Anderson sucks
[6:07:36] <%sukiyakiwestern> THE TOWN IS MAKING HIM STUPID
[6:07:38] <+BorinCorran> She's fine. Zeus in GOW2 is better. Hades in 3 is pretty good too,
[6:07:39] <cizal11> @Darkfire346 baldur's real boss fight is one of the most free boring thing in the world. and the story stuff is extremely dumb.
[6:07:40] <+Auritus> Woolie, where did you get the hoodie?
[6:07:40] <chromerazor> some of his vids are good and some are awful takes it really depends
[6:07:41] <$FuqBoiSlim> FUCK WAAAAHNDERSON
[6:07:42] <%SirG005E> sir goose :)
[6:07:43] <+LixFury> To be fair his reasoning on the mario thing is solid
[6:07:46] <Laicuss> what a bunch of bad opinions damn
[6:07:46] <captainthunderwolf> Joseph Anderson has pissed a bunch of people off by being a sneering jackass with flimsy arguments and a bunch of deepthroating supporters.
[6:07:50] <hntronium> Mister Anderson
[6:07:52] <+Kazuhira_Boat> Noah Caldwell is better
[6:07:52] <Valdorick> @CrypticMochi Kill Children Mod on any RPG is the way god intended.
[6:07:52] <Cherokia666> and GamingBrit loved RE6, Nobody's perfect
[6:07:53] <Kaneis> Joseph Anderson is a cool guy but he is relentlessly picky
[6:07:54] <th3madness> some mad matthewmatosis marks in this chat
[6:07:56] <Sphincter_Spelunker> I like his laugh. Never bothered looking at his reviews. Now I'm gonna with these hot takes
[6:07:56] <ScreamingMeat> Brad would sacrifice his friends AND family to become a toilet if it meant he'd be immortal
[6:08:01] <+Xeno351> He's just hustling, making controversy for the youtube game
[6:08:03] <+sungkyoo> Being contrarian is cool

[6:08:21] <majindusto> Hating on Silent Hill 2? FUCK HIM THEN!!!
[6:08:21] <%QueequegTheater> Raycevick >>>> Joseph Anderson
[6:08:23] <Dio_TR> Joseph Anderson is the YMS of Videogames
[6:08:24] <jonhenry97> @screamingmeat so Brad is just Pat now?
[6:08:24] <CptBritches> If he hates SH2 then his opinion on anything relating video game quality is completely worthless
[6:08:24] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Sseth and Mandalore
[6:08:25] <+enterprise900> Matthewmatosis is also crap ever since he said that DMC1 is the only good one
[6:08:26] <Pookiedaexzile> Theres only one GOW 2 and thats GEARs 2 muthafucka.
[6:08:26] <captainthunderwolf> Manalore is the only good critic.
[6:08:28] <falseeyed> Raycevick is great, dumb Q&A at the end tho

[6:08:39] <Darkfire346> I've donated under at least 17 names just to hear Pat/Paige say it....
[6:08:40] <$ooblagis> Joseph Anderson isn't being contrarian, he legit things the idiotic things he says. You can see his bad opinions form when he streams
[6:08:40] <%SirG005E> Goose stuff is always taken :( and I'm loyal to my names ;p

[6:11:26] <%yuribo26> RE REMAKE
[6:11:27] <Joestar1890> I just want Titanfall 3 damn it!
[6:11:27] <Onyx_Parasaur> Bets tip: Your roster is expendable, your town is forever. So upgrade your town and you can always rebound from party wipes.
[6:11:28] <MrDonTacos_> titanfall trading card game confirmed PogChamp
[6:11:28] <Plague_Nurse> no
[6:11:29] <+PenmanLupine> Yeah, we're sure getting more Titanfall stuff *stares at curled monkeys paw*
[6:11:30] <+Keyd00d> I'd play an RE1 REREmake
[6:11:32] <%GarbageNirvana> That's too many re's
[6:11:34] <Darkfire346> I could see RE1 like this...
[6:11:35] <cizal11> fuck that remake 3 and code veronica first
[6:11:35] <majindusto> Yeah. "Titanfall" stuff
[6:11:35] <Run44forrest> max is a doo doo head

[6:11:43] <saturnianocean> REmake is already great
[6:11:44] <+sungkyoo> That’d be sexy
[6:11:47] <Sphincter_Spelunker> There's Dark Souls and Bloodborne skin mods fo Darkest Dungeon. Pretty slick, when they work
[6:11:47] <bestwaifuritsu> They CAN be beaten, they CAN be beaten bla- I mean beaten back
[6:11:47] <FrustratedAF> DansGame c'mon don't do re1 again
[6:11:48] <%BasiliskEye84> REREREmake
[6:11:49] <CptBritches> It would be fun, but they could spend their time remaking games that ACTUALLY need it like Code Veronica
[6:11:54] <Pookiedaexzile> Just like the Confederacy fighting games will lie about their intentions after the war and dismiss their treatment of the blacks aka the Tekken and Smash players
[6:11:54] <AstroFalcon09> but can they remake remake remake
[6:11:54] <%psithen> RE1RE:REmake
[6:11:54] <%Ion_LaserX> RE3 Remake
[6:11:55] <+BopBeep> I think we should still preserve the old gameplay
[6:11:55] <+8framelag> do CV and RE3 first
[6:12:03] <%wolfofsound> cheer500 "If only Leon and Claire could come together like you two did"-Chris Thanks for fucking my guts up with comedy guys
[6:12:03] <rhus> Please remake 3 and CV first tho

[6:12:06] <ScreamingMeat> RE1 Reremake
[6:12:09] <+taltalheights> Curious is the Remake makers art
[6:12:09] <+sungkyoo> Don’t even bother if you’re not getting Julia voth
[6:12:10] <WaxWitch> Remake DMC2 to not be shit
[6:12:10] <%sukiyakiwestern> RE:REmake REmaster
[6:12:10] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> Remake it all.
[6:12:12] <+allups> reeemake
[6:12:13] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> OUTBREAK
[6:12:14] <+phatmac16> Do CV
[6:12:14] <%komenja> what about DINOCRISIS
[6:12:16] <zerocruz> Crimson head would be bad
[6:12:17] <NerdSquid> or IDK RE8??
[6:12:18] <$theKittenhugs> What if they remade RE4 Kappa
[6:12:19] <+xx123manxx> Imagine if this game played like RE4
[6:12:20] <Darkfire346> what about the best RE game? RE;Gaiden remake!
[6:12:21] <%Ariksgabs> RE3 Remake, then RE8
[6:12:21] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> REmake RE1 but have 0 included as well @woolieversus
[6:12:21] <lovesosa236> but never 4??
[6:12:21] <Vital_Ire> yeah but Wehn do they remake RE4
[6:12:23] <%ssjklyco> Just make it RE2 DLC: RE1
[6:12:23] <+JacktheMan18> They could make it a mini DLCcampaign with that size
[6:12:24] <Pat_Squared> REmake was already perfectly fine
[6:12:24] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> ReMake is perfect
[6:12:24] <nobknee> @WaxWitch What ya talkin' about? Kappa
[6:12:25] <AstroFalcon09> capcom got a remake and it was worth it
[6:12:25] <heytakeiteasyterry> you should have sex with pokemon
[6:12:26] <laguerrilha> RE3 and RE Outbreak remake first
[6:12:26] <Pygmalionic> I want RE8 where they try so hard to correct the sexless world criticisms.
[6:12:27] <rick_deckard_84> and CV
[6:12:28] <DuoScratch> yeahyeah yeahyeahyeahyeah yeah 3 NEXT!
[6:12:29] <gdarrowood> What about Code Veronica????
[6:12:29] <jonhenry97> fuck it, REmake em all. I'll buy em
[6:12:29] <OkamiDude15> @SkewerSTARSTREAM that would be pretty cool
[6:12:31] <weskersdwnfwdheavy> Remake Titan Fall 2
[6:12:33] <+sungkyoo> Crimson heads in the style of re2 POGGERS
[6:12:33] <+solidpeyo> RE 3 and Code Veronica first
[6:12:34] <DracaenaLeaf> Code Veronica
[6:12:38] <%MrBorisMakarov> ye
[6:12:38] <EphemeralBlitz0> I'd like a Code Veronica REmake before RE3
[6:12:40] <+8framelag> CV or RE0?
[6:12:41] <Magnetgear> @WoolieVersus And then they Remake RE6
[6:12:41] <VentusHero> what about zero?
[6:12:42] <RedoctoberWolf> code veronica was my first RE game
[6:12:43] <%stagemage> a code veronica remake would be sick
[6:12:43] <Sphincter_Spelunker> But what if they make it worse
[6:12:43] <Darkfire346> CV was alright....
[6:12:43] <mr_miyagichu> I remember this convo in the podcast
[6:12:43] <%QueequegTheater> Remake Dark Souls like they did for 2
[6:12:44] <Run44forrest> just take out steve
[6:12:44] <CptBritches> CV or 0. Remakes are better when they are remaking something bad and they turn it into a gem
[6:12:47] <%itsjustdoogan> CV Remake above all other remakes atm
[6:12:48] <lovesosa236> but imagine RE4
[6:12:48] <%sukiyakiwestern> Yeah but fuck code Veronica just take it out of cankn
[6:12:49] <%tank7013> As long as Steve stays dead I'm up for it
[6:12:49] <majindusto> It doest suck tho
[6:12:49] <+Kanax55> KIRBY-SAMA
[6:12:50] <rytisone> Remake Umbrella Chronicles
[6:12:50] <Valdorick> I think the truest form of a RE1make would be clownfart music on every room.
[6:12:50] <Dull_Fangs> How about they just reboot the series
[6:12:53] <ArtThouBored> What abut Zero
[6:12:53] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Code Veronica was bad, Steve is terrible
[6:12:53] <Sloavon> fuck you Jake
[6:12:55] <%ssjklyco> 6 sucks
[6:12:56] <jonhenry97> Outbreak! Outbreak! Outbreak!
[6:12:58] <CassyASG> no it doesn't crazy talk
[6:12:58] <subjectg> @indoorsitup iirc his reasoning for not liking reach as much was that it didn’t particularly innovate in the same way the main games did, which is a fair thing to say but i don’t think its focus of giving more content of the things already there isn’t bad per se
[6:13:01] <captwolfaroo> Dino Crisis please, Capcom
[6:13:01] <%TeethMuncher> I want that kirby light
[6:13:03] <Slack_Attack> Nah man RE 6 is so stupid that its awesome

[6:13:09] <ahbhajit> Code Veronica is garbage, so it benefit from a remake
[6:13:10] <+sungkyoo> Remake it and make Steve into the coolest character ever so people will like him and hate it
[6:13:11] <%krispen_wa> RE6 had best Ada tho

[6:15:37] <+8framelag> @jonhenry97 5 and 6 are action (co-op) games not survival horror
[6:15:38] <%itsjustdoogan> Fighting games need friends, I do not have these
[6:15:39] <+Dingus_Tickler> @jonhenry97 Try playing the games yourself, and ask that question again atpCap

[6:15:51] <+sungkyoo> Fighting games are unpopular, shockingly
[6:15:51] <mercado94> People dont like losing. Thats why fighting games will never be "popular"
[6:15:56] <Samex_Comex> Fighting games rule!

[6:16:30] <+gwanzan> someone should make a fighting game with Smash imputs
[6:16:30] <+atwitchical> Smash killed the Best Friends.
[6:16:31] <+JenovasPuppet> I don't like fighting games because I don't want to study to play video games.
[6:16:31] <+deadpalvgz> oh no
[6:16:33] <+sungkyoo> fighting games take a ton of time investment too

[6:16:40] <Vital_Ire> SMash is a fighting game, It's a platform fighter
[6:16:46] <DefiniteRobot> I don't like fighting games because they feel like work
[6:16:46] <FrustratedAF> clearly more fight games need 4+ people and items Kappa
[6:16:47] <+dickbuttwoman> Smash is the Monopoly of video games. Everyone's like "I like monopoly", but everyone HATES playing monopoly.
[6:16:47] <VentusHero> what about the best fighting game: Anarachy Reigns?
[6:16:47] <laguerrilha> Few people play 1v1 on Smash
[6:16:48] <MrDonTacos_> :>smash is a fighting game
[6:16:50] <+miguelrod777> fighting games take too much time to have fun
[6:16:53] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Learning a fighting game is homework

[6:16:58] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> FUCK "Play to Learn, not to Win" that SUCKS
[6:17:00] <Panquake25> I always considered smash more of a party game, fgc aside
[6:17:02] <Fujiwara_92> Ppl dont like losing, and fg are about learning from loss
[6:17:03] <+solidpeyo> fighting games are too hardcore
[6:17:03] <bbomi1995> love fighting games but theyre just somewhat slow to watch live
[6:17:03] <$ooblagis> Me and my friends ALWAYS played 1v1 in Smash
[6:17:05] <Prevot> isn't competitive smash all 1v1?
[6:17:05] <LunarLancaster> Smash is Babies First Fighting Game
[6:17:06] <%Aitch971> Its some of the typical fighting game imputs. love fighting games but i am utter shit and will never get good
[6:17:07] <$prince_ire> Anyone who says "smash isn't a fighting game" is pretentious asshole. Its a fighting game, get over it.
[6:17:07] <+taltalheights> Pat, feed Woolie, he needs to become powerful for the next stream
[6:17:08] <MaximumSleep> i dunno about fighting game but its fun
[6:17:08] <torontototoro> how long ago did Woolz stop playing RE2?
[6:17:10] <captainthunderwolf> @itsjustdoogan Sakurai, it's a casual fighting game. Party game isn't a mechanical genre.
[6:17:10] <Pookiedaexzile> Idiots don't understand. Fighting game Royale. 3rd strike style one screen multiple level building
[6:17:11] <CptBritches> Plague speaking the TRUTH
[6:17:11] <+8framelag> fighting game streams usually have low audience interaction

[6:17:40] <23rald> feedback: bodied
[6:17:41] <+LogothX> Video games are usually adept at teaching you without you knowing. Fighting games lack this.
[6:17:41] <DomunDomunDomun> Smash is clearly a different genre to fighting games and there's nothing wrong with that.
[6:17:41] <%MisterCrimson> @WoolieVersus We learn to hold the L so that the L can never hold us
[6:17:43] <ebonifragaria> I like to fail my way to victory, but only in private
[6:17:43] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> People want instagratification now, it's also a problem with FPS games right now.
[6:17:45] <%SirG005E> from the standpoint of a developer; its very hard to translate what feels good into what looks understandable and retains fun for both players

[6:19:34] <mr_miyagichu> Smash is popular because it A. can be played like a party game with multiple people and B. The roster with nintendo characters is nice for a lot of people. It is also worth knowing that smash rewards the winner with a win pose instead of telling the loser that they lost so that might help but if it does that is a small factor

[6:22:30] <%Ion_LaserX> I HAVE THIS
[6:22:30] <+sungkyoo> They’ll fuck you up, that’s the explanation
[6:22:31] <%QueequegTheater> ESPECIALLY AGAINST LIVING THINGS
[6:22:32] <+MajorCrasher> it's for melting through armor
[6:22:33] <+mik255> is umbrella just like space pirates
[6:22:34] <Fujiwara_92> Acid is cool
[6:22:36] <xavior1993> yes!

[6:22:37] <TheArrow_> no more questions your honor
[6:22:38] <%sukiyakiwestern> WOOOOOAH THIS HALL IS DANGEROUS
[6:22:38] <Guardiansaiyan> Tear Gas
[6:22:38] <Dapper_Cactuar> because armored vehicles
[6:22:39] <reinbachthe3rd> Fucking war crimes.
[6:22:40] <falseeyed> Vidja
[6:22:40] <+gwanzan> That's Wesker for you
[6:22:42] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> WHAT IS IT?!
[6:22:42] <AncelDeLambert> they're kinda against the Geneva Convention
[6:22:43] <Laironx3> Believe it
[6:22:43] <LunarLancaster> Acid bombs would be a fucking war crime
[6:22:44] <+NobleJedi> I CLAPPED WHEN HE SAID IT
[6:22:44] <+elsievoid> They'd be used on black people exclusively in the real world
[6:22:44] <Pygmalionic> Metal Gear Acid is sick
[6:22:45] <+Nomicro4u> geneva convention wat
[6:22:45] <kingdudeby> That's against the geneva convention. They can't use them.
[6:22:45] <Halospaz117> It would be war crimes: the gun
[6:22:47] <Patzzki217> WAR CRIMES
[6:22:50] <Slack_Attack> I assume Umbrella made them too put down failed experiments
[6:22:51] <+8framelag> they're both pretty bad
[6:22:51] <subjectg> Remember that the Geneva convention exists
[6:22:53] <%TeethMuncher> Can i get some extra cruelty?
[6:22:53] <%Ion_LaserX> LOOK AT THIS
[6:22:53] <%QueequegTheater> PLAY SPEC OPS YOU COWARDS
[6:22:54] <OwlLightningMage> Napalm does exist
[6:22:54] <Prevot> would be great to have in Dead Space
[6:22:59] <SkewerSTARSTREAM> Armored vehicles?
[6:22:59] <qazwsxedc168> metal gear acid is a cool idea but some of the level designs suck
[6:22:59] <%SirG005E> demoralization?
[6:23:00] <Guardiansaiyan> Mustard Gas
[6:23:00] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Umbrella humane?
[6:23:01] <%foreverN2dust> think of the collateral from the fire
[6:23:01] <GeneralHysterics> Most burn victims survive
[6:23:02] <Desertfishing> WAR CRIMES START NOW!
[6:23:02] <cisealnine> Fun Fact: Some police forces have sound canons that make people shit themselves. They are primarily used to disperse crowds.
[6:23:03] <+casualbaloth> oh geez what is happening

[6:23:06] <nademonkey1100> nah they are not willie pete
[6:23:08] <+luftraumm1> acid also doesn't work like that in real life
[6:23:08] <+LogothX> My eyes! The goggles do nothing!
[6:23:10] <%psithen> well what the fuck are freeze rounds
[6:23:12] <%yuribo26> ITS FINE, DONT WORRY ABOUT IT
[6:23:13] <+Nomicro4u> acid attacks only happen in britain
[6:23:14] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> Remember that guy from RoboCop
[6:23:14] <kingdudeby> blowing someone up with a hand grenade is more economical than trying to build an acid grenade.

[6:23:26] <Graxe_> They are napalm flame grenades in Resident Evil. And freeze rounds are liquid nitrogen.
[6:23:27] <SkewerSTARSTREAM> What about the freeze rounds?
[6:23:28] <lloyddboy> suuker soaker
[6:23:30] <Vigonept> i was waiting for it to be over but its still going

[6:30:40] <Pookiedaexzile> Woolie wont admit his fault in logic. The Lab culture kills fighting games. If the game makes you need home work it can go fuck itself. You get better at other games by playing live players, you get better at street fighter 5 by fighting bots who stand still

[6:38:56] <+dickbuttwoman> NO! Fuck that! Bring back dino crisis!
[6:38:59] <jaguarkek318> RIP dino crisis
[6:38:59] <+connos_livereview> Id love to see dino crisis and parasite remade
[6:39:00] <%yuribo26> @Canti58 I'm pretty sure you can watch the vod right now
[6:39:01] <Plutt_bug> Dino Crisis? More like Shit!
[6:39:03] <WotanCR> true
[6:39:04] <+Repulsion__> Play the xfiles game moon2A
[6:39:05] <falseeyed> Dino Crisis is just... Bad.
[6:39:08] <majindusto> DINO CRISIS needs to return
[6:39:08] <RichAnvils> Pat the trains have stopped running, you need to call mom to take you home.
[6:39:08] <%BasiliskEye84> Dino Crisis 1 actually sold like 3 million copies back in the day when 3 million was a huge number.
[6:39:10] <Desertfishing> oh shit it castle super beast: after dark
[6:39:11] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @gdarrowood
[6:39:12] <+terry_quest> reboot
[6:39:12] <captwolfaroo> Dino Crisis 1 is rad you cad
[6:39:13] <%Piemen99> LEON PLEASE WELSKER TELEPORTED MY BALLS
[6:39:15] <+8framelag> it could work but it's just that raptor opening door scene
[6:39:15] <%ssjklyco> Can we get a new Breath of Fire? A real one?
[6:39:18] <%NME_Dom> PAT why you want to bring out trash on peoples stream
[6:39:18] <zerocruz> 2 is rad tho
[6:39:19] <@Solidus_113> what if we got Parasite Eve like REmake 2?
[6:39:20] <Anthony_smith_88> do you know how much it costs to motion capture dinosaurs? jeez
[6:39:23] <jonhenry97> For Woolie and Pat, how many sequels and spinoffs is too many? RE for ex. 7 main games and several spinoffs and reiterations. But as for RE, they could keep releasing games for it, and I'd be fine. Should spinoffs keep a series alive?
[6:39:29] <DRAGKUDO> Just make Dino crisis Resident evil 8
[6:39:29] <%stagemage> and that is still too much to ack for
[6:39:30] <reonome> dino crisis remake
[6:39:31] <jaguarkek318> LUL welsker
[6:39:34] <+lastbreeze> @solidus_113 yesssssss

[6:39:38] <+Keyd00d> elmo game strong
[6:39:39] <CaptainDictator> TOXO
[6:39:40] <CptBritches> I think they probably think that a new Dino Crisis game isn't possible and the only thing that MIGHT happen would be a remake
[6:39:43] <%yuribo26> DO DMC5 PLEASE BibleThump
[6:39:44] <majindusto> Pat has bad opinions
[6:39:45] <ToastyBroDude> Niko?

[6:44:58] <%yuribo26> @puse9 around 6 hours, they will not play anymore, you can watch the vod already
[6:44:59] <$ooblagis> Assume they were buried after being infected I guess
[6:45:00] <laguerrilha> Burned corpses and rain?
[6:45:02] <JayPastaForce> You need GUTS to be infected
[6:45:02] <natebud> Can we all just forget about Code Veronica?
[6:45:02] <%Soul_Bruce_Lee> RE6 has corpses too
[6:45:05] <Desertfishing> from the rain which was tainted from a crematorium
[6:45:08] <%sukiyakiwestern> SPPOKY SKELLINGTONS
[6:45:10] <OwlLightningMage> Joe Baker punches zombies to death

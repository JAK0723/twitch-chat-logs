[0:18:16] <+uncledickbutt> drop the katana, perfect
[0:18:20] <Dragon_Batman> sometimes hinting at an item or a small tip
[0:18:21] <Graxe_> But a little bit of wasting time if fine.
[0:18:34] <gustavozxd> do it like Pat and lie
[0:18:38] <Graxe_> Just not an excess of it.
[0:18:41] <+tigerfang86> lie and cheat
[0:18:44] <+tigerfang86> pat powers
[0:18:48] <Iggeh0> just breathe into the mic loudly and don't say a word
[0:18:48] <%Lion_kun> point him to secrets
[0:18:49] <Dragon_Batman> steal and snitch
[0:18:50] <+TopTieramisu> minh should give commentary about what he thinks the lore is
[0:18:50] <Mendin> Oh jesus christ, I just realized, Minh is standing in for the Pat role in Woolie Plays A From Game, this is going to be amazing
[0:18:51] <Shishi1205> The way to kill the bull 2.0 is so damn funny
[0:18:55] <TheDr0t> make him die 8n spectacular ways
[0:19:01] <ScreamingMeat> Minh will be Pat for this stream
[0:19:12] <Shishi1205> just saw it the other day, and then thinking about how much it cost for pat to kill it lmao
[0:19:18] <Dragon_Batman> Sounds like a good plan
[0:19:24] <worldbrand> I really like the woolie copilot system actually, makes for really fun LPs

[0:19:42] <Graxe_> I can see him more easily now
[0:19:44] <worldbrand> Wait until he dies
[0:19:45] <+tigerfang86> YEAH DO IT
[0:19:45] <Dragon_Batman> That could happen
[0:19:46] <gustavozxd> but do it like Pat and say "look to the left of your shield" for 2 hours
[0:19:47] <+tigerfang86> DESTROY HIM
[0:19:48] <+TopTieramisu> @Shishi1205 but it's worst ending
[0:19:59] <Shishi1205> Yeah, that's why its any%
[0:20:01] <Mendin> Billy: Let him do the wrong thing, die, and then teach. He has to do it wrong first to learn properly

[0:29:17] <@Menitta> Thats hilarious
[0:29:24] <+linSP> you guys really hyped 101 back in the first sbf podcast eps
[0:29:29] <deviljhojho94> He completed it and was loved, but if that is not your style we get it
[0:29:34] <worldbrand> yeah imagine if 3 was good and interesting
[0:29:38] <gustavozxd> viewtiful Joe is not in mvci but Spencer is, there you have it.
[0:29:38] <%Lion_kun> Outer Worlds ftw
[0:29:40] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Play Fallout 76 LUL
[0:29:42] <tUxUt> @WoolieVersus youre the reason bethesda is full of bugs!
[0:29:43] <+Fyre_link> TBH fallout new vegas is the only one worth playing
[0:29:49] <%bars_l> hold uop
[0:29:52] <tearknack> @WoolieVersus fallout new vegas is only barely a bethesda game. its got writing n shit
[0:29:53] <lewdskeletor13> Pat is gonna stream the New Vegas DLCS in the future
[0:29:53] <@Menitta> 3 is fine, New Vegas is where its at
[0:29:55] <%Lion_kun> They all suck except new Vegas

[0:30:00] <+eossg1> I enjoyed Fallout 3
[0:30:01] <Calek> Fallout 1, 2, New Vegas
[0:30:01] <gustavozxd> Spencer in mvci is a scar that will never heal
[0:30:02] <Dragon_Batman> It's really up to what you make it out to be I think
[0:30:04] <%Lion_kun> 1 and 2 are great
[0:30:12] <deviljhojho94> 2 is nice, very nice
[0:30:14] <+hax_metatron> ResidentSleeper
[0:30:17] <%Lion_kun> tby suck I meant in the bethesda era
[0:30:19] <%bars_l> and 3 is ok
[0:30:20] <lewdskeletor13> New Vegas is easily the best one
[0:30:24] <@Menitta> New Vegas is a game like Mass Effect where it could just be dialogue
[0:30:24] <deviljhojho94> Time to beat up daigo in a parking lot
[0:30:35] <BunnyEmperor> Woolie will go to Evo until he beats Daigo
[0:30:38] <%bars_l> and 4 is okay but not a fallout game
[0:30:42] <%Lion_kun> I wanna play 101 but don't have a Wii
[0:30:42] <+KSabot> more likely to find daigo sleeping on a bench
[0:30:48] <+masterfire23> fallout is weird, I spent 3 hrs cheesing a merchant in fallout 3.

[0:31:08] <Shishi1205> Evo this year will not stink as much? @WoolieVersus
[0:31:13] <Captain_Aham> wish it came to the switch, never got the wiiu
[0:31:32] <gustavozxd> I bought the wind waker collector Wii U and the game came as a fucking download code
[0:31:34] <lewdskeletor13> I don’t think a lot of people got the Wii U
[0:31:35] <+Xchunkylover73x> new place?
[0:31:39] <+eossg1> They seem to be porting everything to switch, so I wouldn't worry about wiiu exclusives
[0:31:42] <Nina96> part of the issue is that it was on the wiiu
[0:31:45] <gustavozxd> a fucking download code
[0:31:53] <+tigerfang86> LESS content
[0:31:53] <Prevot> 101, TMS #FE and Fatal Frame V all failed super hard

[0:32:11] <deviljhojho94> TMS FE was asking to fail tho
[0:32:13] <@Solidus_113> much like Okami too
[0:32:16] <%Lion_kun> Astral Chain ftw
[0:32:17] <+NobleJedi> Hallow Knight Kreygasm
[0:32:17] <worldbrand> I felt that way with world of light, hollow knight not so much
[0:32:17] <Dragon_Batman> and Hollow Knight is rife with amazing game
[0:32:20] <@Menitta> Remember when people were worried W101 was too short?
[0:32:20] <deviljhojho94> Wonderful 101 just had a lack of marketing
[0:32:32] <gustavozxd> remember when TMS was a crossover? me neither
[0:32:33] <reiju_22> I liked TMS but man those session attacks NotLikeThis
[0:32:33] <+Shinmaddrox> Should have been optional.
[0:32:44] <+TopTieramisu> hollow knight was an extremely good bargain
[0:32:48] <prime_name> TMS's first trailer should have never exisited.
[0:32:48] <Coystick> "Video games were a mistake " - Woolie Madden 2019
[0:32:50] <+Shinmaddrox> Like make alot of it a DMC secret missions type of thing
[0:32:54] <%Luvinsus> I remember saying "Oh shit, time for the final boss" more than once when I first played 101 LUL
[0:32:56] <@Menitta> Mario Odyssey had that to a fault almost though

[0:33:09] <+Mighty_observer> someone tell me it ain't true! WWE Xavier has a sextape 😢
[0:33:11] <Nina96> P5
[0:33:13] <copyritetm> big disagree on that woolie
[0:33:15] <Megafang2145> I've been wanting to jump into the character action genre ever since watching the DMC playthroughs and Im thinking of staring at Astral Chain
[0:33:27] <gustavozxd> TMS was advertised for OMEGA WEEBS, and then they censor some minor thing that doesn't matter, of course you're gonna piss them off
[0:33:35] <rararasputino> It's like 25 hours
[0:33:36] <SilverAncient> Woolie is crazy. There is never too much game.
[0:33:41] <@Menitta> We'd live in a world where KOTOR is 99 episodes and W101 is longer then
[0:33:44] <Nina96> make 5min ep to make 101 ep
[0:33:49] <+buttdirt> @Mighty_observer wouldn't surprise me, the man's a sex machine
[0:33:53] <GobblesInTheMist> Thank you @WoolieVersus for transistor i would have never have found that game and the Music the Did i mention THE MUSIC thank you for enlightening with such a beautiful creation....would love to see you play it but if its in your private special place I total understand.

[0:41:08] <Dragon_Batman> Alot of posture damage
[0:41:16] <crimsonharvest> kiku ichimonji is a great name it's been in other games for a long time
[0:41:18] <%GabeSweetMan> Invest into Double. It's super worth it.
[0:41:19] <+linSP> shadow rush is my fave
[0:41:22] <+Dragoneye77> you need ichimonji double Woolie

[0:41:56] <%GabeSweetMan> Everything in the Ashina skill tree is worth getting.

[0:44:31] <Dragon_Batman> Eeeey good for him
[0:44:34] <RoboXGP> one of my attempted short cuts was actually a speed run trick
[0:44:43] <Shishi1205> Miko no shnobi
[0:44:48] <Coystick> The field of hugs
[0:44:48] <RoboXGP> i tried jumping through that tree like five times at least
[0:44:55] <Dapper_Cactuar> heyyo
[0:45:39] <Shishi1205> Watching speedruns of this game is amazing
[0:45:44] <RoboXGP> you can also kick jump off of roof ledges if you're not close enough to hang
[0:45:55] <%BurncoatRapscallion> this game is a speed runners dream
[0:45:57] <Shishi1205> the amout of cheese and bullshit you can get away with is awesome
[0:46:01] <Mendin> Another Pat
[0:46:02] <+Grayhammatter> more rats

[0:46:09] <%GabeSweetMan> Current WR on this game is Sub 25 minutes now.
[0:46:11] <Coystick> The Pat clan!
[0:46:13] <Shishi1205> Also you only need to kill one rat for the mision to be complete
[0:46:13] <+tigerfang86> kill all the pats

[0:46:17] <+InstiGaitan> Dude some of the speedruns are insane @Shishi1205
[0:46:20] <Therinaud> Farm the lalafell
[0:46:31] <+InstiGaitan> They glitch out of the world and just swim through it
[0:46:41] <+Grayhammatter> plunging attack!
[0:46:41] <Shishi1205> The kill on the beginnig ogre is hilariois
[0:46:43] <RoboXGP> through the deep convenant
[0:46:51] <+Grayhammatter> welp LUL
[0:46:52] <+Dragoneye77> lol
[0:46:54] <+tigerfang86> NICE
[0:46:55] <%BurncoatRapscallion> there's literally only a 10 minute difference between bad end and normal end now
[0:46:57] <+tigerfang86> SICK
[0:47:01] <+hax_metatron> @WoolieVersus You have to jump off an edge to get a jumping deathblow
[0:47:05] <Coystick> Graceful like the oxen
[0:47:10] <RoboXGP> when the characters property changes to swimming you can pretty much do anything once you get out of bounds
[0:47:21] <%GabeSweetMan> The most INSANE skip atm is Senpou Temple skip.
[0:47:23] <Shishi1205> You actually can kill less bosses for the good end than the bad end
[0:47:35] <Shishi1205> Well, a week ago at least
[0:47:35] <deviljhojho94> Gods be praised
[0:47:43] <%GabeSweetMan> You fall for LITERALLY a minute and fall into the boss fight.
[0:47:44] <Shishi1205> with new skips maybe its equal
[0:48:01] <Shishi1205> Have you seen the ape skip?
[0:48:03] <Bailey__gaming> oh Hai Woolie how far are you man?
[0:48:06] <+hax_metatron> Why would that happen? You will never fight anyone there ever again Kappa
[0:48:32] <RoboXGP> stealth kill
[0:48:36] <%Solidnick18> buying the money bags is pretty helpful
[0:48:37] <Videogamer4> Kappa
[0:48:49] <RoboXGP> borks
[0:48:50] <%GabeSweetMan> The dumbest achievement is "Get Every Skill" thus nullifying the purpose of creating any sort of unique build even for how minor the skill upgrades are.
[0:48:51] <+Dragoneye77> I swear no one ever realizes the side path here
[0:48:58] <Shishi1205> Hey same minh
[0:49:01] <worldbrand> yeah he's WR holder right now isn't he?
[0:49:05] <worldbrand> for shura at least
[0:49:05] <Dragon_Batman> @Bailey__gaming hasn't done the boss fight at ashina castle yet
[0:49:09] <+thackattack00> Dist uploads a new WR like every day
[0:49:10] <Mendin> Current any% record is a skoch under 25min
[0:49:18] <Shishi1205> The under 25 min one was uploaded this morning
[0:49:23] <%GabeSweetMan> In addition to being just meaningless grinding.
[0:49:23] <%Solidnick18> Snake skip
[0:49:23] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:49:23] <worldbrand> dang
[0:49:24] <deviljhojho94> I usually only watch runs without exploits
[0:49:29] <lyzegredjag> The Any% is insanely full of glitch and skips
[0:49:34] <+CrescentRubyRose> Any% is a mess right now
[0:49:43] <+Mighty_observer> skyrim runs
[0:49:48] <%GabeSweetMan> My favorite skip atm is Guardian Ape skip.
[0:49:53] <wirblewomble> bugs are not exploits, apparently
[0:49:56] <+InstiGaitan> My boi distortion
[0:50:00] <%Solidnick18> any% is like shura ending is the fastest
[0:50:01] <+tigerfang86> GONGED
[0:50:02] <Dragon_Batman> Yeeee gotta love those guys
[0:50:02] <+InstiGaitan> With his sub 25
[0:50:03] <Mendin> My favorite skip is getting Shit Sniped
[0:50:07] <+hax_metatron> The "Pat" enemy LUL
[0:50:15] <JJnAJjohnson> gotem
[0:50:17] <%BurncoatRapscallion> the narc
[0:50:17] <deviljhojho94> I suposse the difference between an exploit and a bug depends on perspective
[0:50:20] <Shishi1205> Lmao the poop snipe
[0:50:26] <RoboXGP> where are those midget dudes from anyway they look so 90's
[0:50:29] <worldbrand> i enjoy seeing the skips found as runs progress, but yeah having them in the actual runs can make it less interesting because you want to see how they handle encounters
[0:50:38] <%Solidnick18> nani
[0:50:39] <lyzegredjag> You fight like 3 bosses wihout cheese in Any%
[0:50:39] <RoboXGP> they look like the midgets from Venture bros
[0:50:40] <+Dragoneye77> Look it Pat
[0:50:44] <%Solidnick18> lol

[0:52:26] <kevinwager> woolie what do u think of akuma pikachu using. max and LTG name for views
[0:52:39] <gammongaming11> who is the dude next to woolie?
[0:52:44] <+hax_metatron> Ceramic shards are useful around corners @WoolieVersus
[0:52:46] <%GabeSweetMan> Item pickups are weird. The item has to be on screen for some reason.
[0:52:47] <Shishi1205> Fun fact, item pick up is based on camera angle
[0:52:49] <Bailey__gaming> 7 spears pushed my shit in super hard for a while
[0:52:51] <sirrice77> i never used them
[0:52:53] <+linSP> i just saw a floating head for one frame
[0:52:54] <Nina96> @gammongaming11 a god
[0:52:56] <+hax_metatron> You have to lock on with the shards around corners @WoolieVersus
[0:52:56] <+InstiGaitan> I hate how you have to look at the items to pick them up
[0:52:57] <%GabeSweetMan> POCKET SAND is super useful.
[0:52:57] <+MagickBurritoh> Pocket sand is great
[0:53:04] <+InstiGaitan> It was never like that in other souls games right?
[0:53:05] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Psh ltg doesnt get views
[0:53:05] <%GabeSweetMan> You have to be in their face though.
[0:53:05] <+Mighty_observer> and i just got done watching the best friends talk about Batman vs superman 😭
[0:53:09] <+Grayhammatter> POCKET SAND
[0:53:09] <Mendin> The shard description makes it sound like empty magazines from MGS, b ut they're pebbles from BB
[0:53:10] <Graxe_> Pocket sand just doesn't go very far
[0:53:14] <shadow1man9> Pocket Sand can be used to cheese a couple bosses
[0:53:16] <%GabeSweetMan> Pocket sand is NOT a ranged item.
[0:53:18] <kevinwager> this is onther nioh
[0:53:22] <+linSP> pat is the WORST
[0:53:22] <Graxe_> That's why I don't use it

[1:06:13] <th3madness> this guy probably killed me the most of any enemy in the game
[1:06:16] <th3madness> and you can't do it now
[1:06:18] <%GabeSweetMan> The camera is the real boss of that enemy. I died so many times to him just because the lock on would break for NO REASON.
[1:06:19] <worldbrand> People complain about the camera in that arena a lot, but there's a whole other area to it they never use
[1:06:32] <juxtest> These guys not actually getting any stronger is great. So much vengeance
[1:06:33] <th3madness> the hallway also sucks
[1:06:34] <+fatal_penguin_> When are we getting the Easy Mode patch on this. (lol)
[1:06:36] <Nina96> does woolie ever check chat?
[1:06:47] <%dukenux> Ohay Woolz
[1:06:47] <th3madness> only when he wants to be misled
[1:06:47] <TwinBat> late advice is late
[1:06:48] <%GabeSweetMan> Checking chat is impossible while playing this game.
[1:06:49] <+gwyndolinisbestwaifu> it's not much, pretty much 'where did that bitch-ass ninja john sekiro go?'
[1:06:49] <Dragon_Batman> He does from time to time

[1:08:21] <%Solidnick18> jump on heads for big posture damage
[1:08:21] <+Mighty_observer> how many deaths woolie in?
[1:08:27] <@Solidus_113> there was no podcast this week because Woolie was sick
[1:08:28] <Dragon_Batman> Yea he is just tough
[1:08:39] <seniorswitchback> Won’t lie this may be my least favorite fight in the game, cause it feels like your fighting the boss and his partner, the camera
[1:08:40] <valriot> the arena is just shit
[1:08:41] <Shir0yasha> this is better than the damn vilehand
[1:08:45] <%Solidnick18> oh rot
[1:08:48] <Mendin> You have
[1:08:49] <JJnAJjohnson> well shit
[1:08:50] <%GabeSweetMan> Vilehand is an ASSHOLE.
[1:08:50] <worldbrand> he's a merchant

[1:09:01] <%Lion_kun> Mob of Crows
[1:09:01] <EVA_Unit02> Mobs are merchant
[1:09:02] <Mendin> the merchants are part of the Memorial Mob
[1:09:03] <th3madness> it's totally the merchant
[1:09:04] <+Grayhammatter> he's the memorial mob woolie
[1:09:07] <Zeemod155> Can't infect someone you haven't met
[1:09:10] <+NarcissistCactus> it's a mob
[1:09:10] <valriot> Mob Psycho
[1:09:11] <%GabeSweetMan> Mob = Memorial Mob
[1:09:14] <shadow1man9> He's the merchant by Gyobu's arena
[1:09:16] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Has he ecountered the wooooo guys yet?
[1:09:18] <gammongaming11> the problem with that miniboss isn't the miniboss himself but being forced to fight him in a small room
[1:09:19] <+tigerfang86> you can totally infect people you haven't met lol
[1:09:23] <%GabeSweetMan> @HentaiSenpai9K He has.
[1:09:25] <Shishi1205> yes
[1:09:27] <tearknack> @WoolieVersus its the merchant, the names in the dragonrot aren't their exact names

[1:09:56] <worldbrand> the hallway ain't fantastic, but i preferred it to the little square

[1:10:18] <%GabeSweetMan> Your mid-air control is decently high.

[1:10:52] <%Solidnick18> i just did hit and then parry
[1:10:54] <+SteebsOtherPants> mopT
[1:11:08] <th3madness> gotta jump sweeps woolie
[1:11:10] <Aydarkzero> this arena suck
[1:11:18] <worldbrand> The warning just means unblockable. sometimes they're sweeps, thrusts, or grabs
[1:11:20] <%Solidnick18> the big combo start up is the counter thing
[1:11:22] <%BurncoatRapscallion> I had better luck fighting in this game without using techniques that much
[1:11:30] <%GabeSweetMan> Advice: When there is a bright FLASH from an enemy's weapon that means you have been deflected by them an an attack is incoming. You'll want to stop swinging and get ready with your own deflect/block.
[1:11:33] <+detbasil> Is this woolie's first fight with longswordsman?
[1:11:35] <juxtest> After he jumps he does a sweep
[1:11:43] <Shir0yasha> wait did he missed the deathblow lol
[1:11:50] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Dont dro[p your shield
[1:11:54] <GalaxyCrusher> @solidus oh okay, I'm glad he's better now. Thank you.
[1:11:55] <+dave323dave> HOLD UP YOUR SHIELD
[1:11:55] <+hax_metatron> NEVER DROP YOUR SHIELD WOOLIE
[1:11:55] <PinkSocks> Don't drop it Woolie
[1:11:56] <Aydarkzero> keep your guard UP
[1:11:56] <+tigerfang86> HOLD YOUR SHIELD
[1:11:59] <valriot> camera is essential non existent in many fight in Sekiro :/
[1:11:59] <%Solidnick18> also health is related to posture
[1:12:00] <+Weeewer> Yep
[1:12:02] <%GabeSweetMan> HOLD UP YOUR SHIELD WOOLIE
[1:12:02] <worldbrand> It takes a second to kick in, though
[1:12:05] <+Weeewer> This is HOLD YOUR SHIELD
[1:12:05] <+hax_metatron> DONT DROP NEVER DROP
[1:12:06] <Shishi1205> Hold that sword
[1:12:07] <%dukenux> This game is not-souls-at-all in so many places
[1:12:09] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> PERFECT
[1:12:09] <%Lion_kun> DON'T DROP YOUR SHIELD
[1:12:13] <%GabeSweetMan> UNLEARN PAT'S ADVICE
[1:12:14] <MarylandJutsu> Hewwo woolie, han and woolie fans
[1:12:17] <+This_is_Marco> this concept pretty much changed the game for me
[1:12:17] <%dukenux> DROP YOUR ROBOT ARM
[1:12:18] <corepercentlives> years of training to drop Kappa
[1:12:18] <Therinaud> Because it drops your mobility and slows you down.
[1:12:20] <overfiend_> blocking an attack does more posture than parry
[1:12:24] <Aydarkzero> know what i mean?
[1:12:29] <valriot> GET IT, its breaking conventions Kappa
[1:12:30] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> SEE WHAT WE MEAN?
[1:12:32] <%dukenux> See?
[1:12:35] <mayorrev> PERFECT
[1:12:36] <%dukenux> Perfect.
[1:12:36] <SilverAncient> drop your shield only to deflect
[1:12:40] <wirblewomble> everyone? you mean PAT?
[1:12:40] <%GabeSweetMan> PERFECT
[1:12:48] <+hax_metatron> This game is so good Kreygasm
[1:12:48] <kek_meisterr> Unrelated but i can't for ther life of me remember the movie where it's basically groundhog day but its a guy who joins the military and he gets reverted back in time everytime he dies. Anyone remember the name?
[1:12:52] <mayorrev> I'M gonna teach ya a PRO TIP
[1:12:55] <corepercentlives> NEVER drop the shield LUL
[1:12:56] <MarylandJutsu> DROP THE WOOLIE

[1:13:07] <Lord_of_all_Edges> DIFFERENT GAME
[1:13:08] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> just to recover posture
[1:13:08] <Jalexster> MAX SKILL
[1:13:08] <Aydarkzero> i didn't say nothin!
[1:13:08] <+tigerfang86> if they said that it's a BIG 3

[1:13:13] <Truebluemc> edge of tomorrow
[1:13:13] <%GabeSweetMan> @kek_meisterr Edge of Tomorrow
[1:13:14] <+Solutha> Who said that?
[1:13:15] <Prevot> Woolie so wrong
[1:13:16] <mayorrev> thats the biggest 3 i ever seen
[1:13:19] <Rexwarrior1> no that's the slogan
[1:13:19] <+Fyre_link> we did it for the meme
[1:13:22] <kek_meisterr> @GabeSweetMan thanks man
[1:13:23] <Graxe_> Jumping deathblows are very positionally specific in this.
[1:13:25] <Rexwarrior1> It's Edge of Tomorrow
[1:13:27] <%dukenux> DS was like, don't rush, take your time
[1:13:30] <+Weeewer> The camera in Sekiro is just awful, and I hate to complain about cameras
[1:13:31] <Graxe_> Like you have to be right on top of them.
[1:13:36] <%dukenux> Meanwhile this is like FIGHT NOW OR DIE
[1:13:37] <+mister_rogers> glad to see you back on stream Woolz! Been worried about ya
[1:13:40] <+Mighty_observer> cool guys don't block
[1:13:41] <Mr_216> Woolie was BORN to play Sekiro
[1:13:44] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Raising your shield on hold while theyre attacking is bad, it builds posture
[1:13:47] <+fatal_penguin_> Edge of tomorrow, shenobi wars
[1:13:49] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Only hold it when youre free
[1:13:56] <ArthurDoyleRPG> No matter what Woolie you're wrong Kappa
[1:14:02] <%dukenux> Live. Die. Die. Repeat.
[1:14:03] <+WordsHere> I actually had the best luck only holding block to raise my posture
[1:14:08] <Shir0yasha> this camera is fked up
[1:14:09] <+bizzer10> Play Ninja Storm 3 you coward
[1:14:15] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Yep
[1:14:17] <corepercentlives> same camera as ds3 but it starts to be a problem since the game so fast
[1:14:19] <+hax_metatron> Just like Souls!
[1:14:22] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Exploit their parries
[1:14:24] <%GabeSweetMan> It's a From tradition to have the camera be one of your worst enemies.
[1:14:26] <+This_is_Marco> genechiro cheese is pretty LUL
[1:14:31] <+hax_metatron> That's not unique to Sekiro, that's a FromSoft classic
[1:14:33] <+rdark_ksu> @WoolieVersus Favorite? Beef, Pork Chicken, Lamb, Seafood
[1:14:37] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Yeah, Genichiro can be cheesed like that
[1:14:39] <%GabeSweetMan> Genichiro is easy once you "solve" his pattern.
[1:14:45] <shadow1man9> Remember you can always coward out and get the drop if you fuck up
[1:15:01] <Shishi1205> You can fuck genichiro by staying in the corner
[1:15:17] <+hax_metatron> Don't spoil the Genichiro fight for him! I want Wools to enjoy that one it's great BibleThump
[1:15:18] <%GabeSweetMan> Fog gate in one direction.
[1:15:21] <wirblewomble> "No, that last one didn't count!"
[1:15:24] <+fatal_penguin_> Go the for eyes. Kick dirt in his face.
[1:15:33] <%GabeSweetMan> There really isn't a WAY to "spoil" Genichiro.
[1:15:35] <deviljhojho94> how the fuck is fog even real lmao just cross over
[1:15:43] <SilverAncient> yeyeye
[1:15:45] <%GabeSweetMan> Genichiro has strats but you have to learn them by doing.
[1:15:49] <Shishi1205> Tomoe must have been the badest bitch, i hope dlc is coming
[1:15:50] <juxtest> Dont mind the sounds of combat, Jinzaemon
[1:15:55] <+hax_metatron> Fighting Genichiro for legit teaches you the game, if you cheese him you won't learn certain important lessons IMO
[1:15:58] <%GabeSweetMan> I REALLY hope Tomoe is DLC.
[1:16:04] <shadow1man9> The sweep and thrust come after specific combos
[1:16:09] <%GabeSweetMan> Thanks lock on!
[1:16:13] <Graxe_> Mikiri counter the leg
[1:16:19] <%GabeSweetMan> Oops
[1:16:29] <%BurncoatRapscallion> Tomoe and Takeru better be DLC
[1:16:35] <+buttdirt> clutcdh fire works
[1:16:36] <%GabeSweetMan> Woolie that leg is a SWORD and that fist is a gun!
[1:16:37] <Shishi1205> Always counter the leg
[1:16:38] <Graxe_> Like, just stomp on the incoming kick
[1:16:47] <PinkSocks> Keep your health up Woolie
[1:16:48] <worldbrand> so close!
[1:16:57] <%GabeSweetMan> YEAAAAH

[1:17:37] <ocxdc> ZERO DEFS
[1:17:37] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:17:37] <ProfessorLitmus> does wollie know about the interaction between contact poison and the mist raven feathers?
[1:17:37] <Djinnazz> he was looking for you.
[1:17:42] <Sporkgasm> i think he said someone hired him
[1:17:43] <+WordsHere> He heard a cowardly wolf was there
[1:17:49] <corepercentlives> looking for that coward shinobi
[1:17:49] <Mr_216> Victory Screeech!
[1:17:50] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> he heard u were a bitch
[1:17:54] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> so he came to fight u
[1:17:54] <Shishi1205> His line was like I heard there was some scum here
[1:18:02] <tradingcat17217> Lol
[1:18:04] <Mendin> "I've heard a cowardly s hinobi who'se given up on life is here, and he might be undying so I should probably be able to find him eventually"
[1:18:06] <kevinwager> lol nioh cross over with sekiro
[1:18:07] <AllenDeadman> he says "I'm looking for the bitch that's supposed to be down here
[1:18:08] <%GabeSweetMan> The 3 year gap is SUPER unexplained in game.
[1:18:13] <+tigerfang86> DUNGEON
[1:18:19] <Nina96> DO IT
[1:18:20] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> CHUNNELED
[1:18:20] <+tigerfang86> CHUNNELED
[1:18:20] <%GabeSweetMan> HALL WUGGIN
[1:18:21] <Zeemod155> FUNnel
[1:18:22] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Everything in this game can get massive cheesed if you want to make it not fun
[1:18:22] <+hax_metatron> Get the bonfire here though
[1:18:24] <Shishi1205> GO
[1:18:25] <%Lion_kun> keep going until the first idol
[1:18:26] <+WordsHere> Does he know why he's here yet?
[1:18:28] <Parapattern> Woolie loves being Chuggled
[1:18:31] <Futurecity10> I just rewatched snailborne. The funnel ptsd is real
[1:18:36] <+This_is_Marco> its the best zone
[1:18:54] <+EySoyCoco> he's going to feel validated very soon
[1:18:56] <young_sn0w> Asian Pat and Woolie play Dark Souls 2?
[1:19:00] <young_sn0w> Kappa
[1:19:02] <+fatal_penguin_> The real boss
[1:19:06] <MarylandJutsu> Dont fall like a CHUMB
[1:19:11] <+hax_metatron> This guy is way better than Pat LUL (jk)
[1:19:12] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @metroidstar
[1:19:12] <+WordsHere> Wide berth
[1:19:13] <fruit_pie_the_magician> OH FUCK shichimen
[1:19:14] <gammongaming11> there are referances to the 3 year gap, but generally it's assumed they were guests of ashina until genichiro set his plan in motion
[1:19:14] <worldbrand> hahahahahahaha
[1:19:18] <%GabeSweetMan> hehehehe
[1:19:20] <metroidstar> sorry for caps
[1:19:20] <+tigerfang86> SPOOKS

[1:19:27] <MarylandJutsu> Woolie VS GHOSTS
[1:19:29] <%GabeSweetMan> apatBig SPOOPS
[1:19:29] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Not a headless
[1:19:30] <%dukenux> Bitch Ass Ghost Fuckers
[1:19:32] <worldbrand> He met a headless
[1:19:33] <shadow1man9> This is a different type of ghost fucker
[1:19:41] <rararasputino> No, different ghost fucker
[1:19:42] <fruit_pie_the_magician> NO YOU DON'T
[1:19:43] <shadow1man9> It's the incredibly easy type
[1:19:44] <%GabeSweetMan> Way easier ghost fucker
[1:19:50] <+EySoyCoco> umbrella <3
[1:19:51] <%GabeSweetMan> This guy is WAAAAY easier.
[1:19:54] <kevinwager> stelth kill the boss
[1:19:58] <nerdblase> Is this the Abyss?
[1:20:01] <%castcode> Woolie gets to fight the Nun this time
[1:20:10] <gammongaming11> you can't stealth kill undying bosses
[1:20:11] <Shir0yasha> the rewards are pretty wack lol
[1:20:12] <Graxe_> A bulging purse
[1:20:17] <Graxe_> Filled to burst
[1:20:17] <metroidstar> these are not those guys
[1:20:18] <Videogamer4> Kreygasm
[1:20:19] <+Mighty_observer> WHO?
[1:20:22] <Shishi1205> There's 5 headless
[1:20:23] <nerdblase> I feel like this is the abyss.
[1:20:24] <Psyramics> thats not them
[1:20:25] <gammongaming11> but thankfully the purple umbrella and the fire thing is really good against thim
[1:20:25] <%GabeSweetMan> headlets
[1:20:26] <juxtest> Theyre not that tough once your used to them
[1:20:26] <AllenDeadman> woolie, this is a different guy
[1:20:28] <Parapattern> My turgid purse
[1:20:28] <+Dragoneye77> headlets
[1:20:32] <+tigerfang86> CRAZY TALK
[1:20:35] <corepercentlives> head let's
[1:20:36] <tysmiller> this is a different kind of bitch ass ghost
[1:20:37] <%dukenux> I like how people just call these shrines bonefires
[1:20:39] <+buttdirt> this guy's still a bastard though
[1:20:40] <%xROCKS7AR> xROCKS7AR subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:20:40] <fruit_pie_the_magician> They are way harder than headless but you don't need confetti
[1:20:44] <MarylandJutsu> SIlly WOOLIE
[1:20:47] <MarylandJutsu> Woolie BIG BLIND
[1:20:47] <+Order_of_Mystery> the reward is literally the ability to do blood bullets but with spirit emblems
[1:20:48] <%GabeSweetMan> These guys unlike headless you can RUSH DOWN super hard and fuck 'em up.
[1:20:49] <Djinnazz> Give hia a wheerl
[1:20:50] <+hax_metatron> Bottomless Woolie Hole Kappa
[1:20:52] <+Bigmeanjean> it basically is tho...
[1:20:55] <%Lion_kun> Rising carp
[1:20:55] <ProfessorLitmus> the rewards from the shichimen warriors are really good actually, the regular headless are crap rewards though
[1:21:00] <valriot> These guys still suck though
[1:21:03] <%Lion_kun> Get rising carp Woolie
[1:21:04] <shadow1man9> Suppress Presence though
[1:21:07] <Shishi1205> Carp up @WoolieVersus
[1:21:11] <gammongaming11> free candy is nice
[1:21:16] <+CMCPasserby> go all ashena tree
[1:21:16] <Shir0yasha> bruh if u got hentai air deathblow, shichimen is ez af
[1:21:18] <shadow1man9> Carp up
[1:21:22] <%dukenux> Botomless (Woolie) Pit
[1:21:23] <worldbrand> I don't know that i *ever* used the ceremonial dagger, but i'm sure it's got great applications
[1:21:26] <%GabeSweetMan> Hanging onto skillpoints is worthwhile.
[1:21:28] <corepercentlives> gets very grindy later
[1:21:33] <ProfessorLitmus> the candy lasts longer than the ghost power versions
[1:21:40] <gammongaming11> ceremonial dagger is like blood bullets
[1:21:46] <%Lion_kun> The holy three are carp up/down, suppress presence and getting health back from kills
[1:21:48] <gammongaming11> you should literally use it after you rest every time
[1:21:54] <%GabeSweetMan> Ceremonial Dagger is great for fights where you can exploit the prosthetic tools.
[1:22:00] <gammongaming11> you get 5 free bullets, and it doesn't go away
[1:22:01] <@Solidus_113> leveling is very exponential
[1:22:03] <Shishi1205> Carp up @WoolieVersus get that
[1:22:18] <Fadedblank247> Breath of Life is amazing, its worth saving up 5 for early
[1:22:20] <Parapattern> Suppress Presence is really handy
[1:22:22] <valriot> Spirit emblems suck, worse than QS bullets
[1:22:28] <+bibleianblack> not a waste but a bad use right now, but holy cow you haven't used carp yet?
[1:22:31] <Mendin> Combat Art, not Shinobi Tool. It's a Jumping Ichimonji charge
[1:22:37] <Shishi1205> Yeah the lifesteal is pretty good
[1:22:46] <gammongaming11> i can't belive he didn't get breath of life
[1:22:50] <gammongaming11> i rushed that shit
[1:22:50] <shadow1man9> @WoolieVersus That's mid-air Combat Arts, not mid-Air prosthetics
[1:22:51] <+WordsHere> Wait, why?
[1:22:52] <Shir0yasha> jumping ichimonji is pretty buff
[1:22:54] <%GabeSweetMan> Life steal is one of the best skills easily.
[1:23:03] <worldbrand> yo those carps tho
[1:23:05] <+bbHighvalor> carp
[1:23:06] <Mendin> Get That Carp
[1:23:08] <%GabeSweetMan> Carps yo yo yo
[1:23:09] <ProfessorLitmus> contact medicine + mist raven feathers= free bloodborne old hunters bone dodges
[1:23:13] <tysmiller> up carp
[1:23:14] <+EySoyCoco> that is a great one
[1:23:14] <%GabeSweetMan> GOTTA GET DAT CARP
[1:23:17] <+WordsHere> He doesn't have the tools the projected attacked work with
[1:23:17] <Parapattern> Dat's a good one too!
[1:23:18] <+tigerfang86> Carp Powers
[1:23:19] <Shishi1205> Get that fish bih
[1:23:25] <KiraKamixephos> How far is woolie?
[1:23:41] <Mendin> Early-mid Ashina Castle first ti me
[1:23:44] <worldbrand> he has not yet cleared the ashina castle boss
[1:23:46] <%GabeSweetMan> Woolie is maybe 25% if that?
[1:23:46] <Shishi1205> Those are passives btw
[1:23:48] <EVA_Unit02> He got to the top of Ashina Castle
[1:23:49] <jotabranded> did you watch last episode of JoJo Part 5 @WoolieVersus ?
[1:23:59] <valriot> Theyre essentially mandatory
[1:24:04] <%GabeSweetMan> He's still super early.
[1:24:09] <Jackomaning> Just finished all achievements on this yesterday. How's Woolie enjoying it?
[1:24:21] <PinkSocks> All Ashina arts are great
[1:24:22] <+gogo_gadgette> HI WOOLIE, HI MINTY!
[1:24:25] <%GabeSweetMan> @Jackomaning How was grinding out them skills?
[1:24:25] <+hax_metatron> POGGERS
[1:24:28] <+Weeewer> 2 is better than one
[1:24:28] <Mendin> DOUBLE REPUUKEN
[1:24:30] <+Mighty_observer> woolie said it sucks
[1:24:30] <+hax_metatron> PogChamp PogChamp BEST MOVE
[1:24:31] <Shishi1205> Best one free
[1:24:32] <+Weeewer> Even more posture recovery
[1:24:32] <@Solidus_113> YEYEYEYEYE
[1:24:34] <Parapattern> Be like water
[1:24:37] <%GabeSweetMan> REPPUKKEN

[1:24:39] <%khalcipher> khalcipher subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:24:45] <Jackomaning> @GabeSweetMan Certainly....the least fun part
[1:24:52] <%superc37> isn't that move incredibly op?
[1:24:53] <%GabeSweetMan> It's dumb too
[1:24:58] <th3madness> HIT
[1:25:00] <%GabeSweetMan> WHY max them out???
[1:25:00] <+OntarioJake> fav move to use mid-air
[1:25:00] <th3madness> HIT AGAIN
[1:25:02] <+hax_metatron> It's so good Kreygasm
[1:25:03] <+r0gamer940> just wait till the final one
[1:25:06] <th3madness> CANNOT BE BEAT
[1:25:12] <+Weeewer> But it has its place in pretty much every fight
[1:25:13] <%GabeSweetMan> You can only equip ONE combat art....
[1:25:15] <Shishi1205> Do it again
[1:25:28] <%superc37> also isn't there also one thats literally just judgment cut.
[1:25:31] <corepercentlives> how is that one skill so op and almost everything else borderline useless
[1:25:32] <%superc37> ?
[1:25:42] <+fatal_penguin_> He
[1:25:46] <th3madness> dragon flash would like a word
[1:25:48] <+hax_metatron> 420 Kappa
[1:25:49] <Jackomaning> I love shadowrush a lot. It was my go to
[1:25:53] <@Solidus_113> same guy from before
[1:25:57] <+hax_metatron> He smoked some good shit LUL
[1:25:58] <%GabeSweetMan> Shadowrush also has good applications.
[1:26:00] <Mendin> praying strikes are actually good, as are leaping kicks
[1:26:03] <Sloavon> KILL KILL
[1:26:03] <+fatal_penguin_> Ooh I got scared. I thought he was pleasing himself
[1:26:04] <+WordsHere> He caught the plot bus
[1:26:05] <%Lion_kun> dragon flash is ng+ only
[1:26:17] <Shir0yasha> all the mushin skill is just flashy lol. ichimonji double ftw
[1:26:25] <Shishi1205> The fact that you can't kill npcs is 👌
[1:26:28] <Nina96> i never understood this quest
[1:26:37] <%superc37> ah, playing with the inferior japanese subs i see...
[1:26:41] <+hax_metatron> @Nina96 It's pretty good, epicnamebro had a good take.
[1:26:44] <Shishi1205> He has 2 paths? 3?
[1:26:46] <Parapattern> Jacking it so right to that music
[1:26:51] <%Lion_kun> you get him to ghost lady and after you kill ghost lady he gives you a reward
[1:26:54] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> he shows up in different places
[1:26:55] <+tigerfang86> he's definitely jackin it
[1:27:01] <%GabeSweetMan> This is probably the least straightfoward quest.
[1:27:10] <Truebluemc> Has he unlocked "Regain vitality from deathblows" yet? It is super invaluable imo
[1:27:12] <Mendin> Let him get to ghost lady, or dungeon, or kill ghost lady before ever meeting him and he'll just attack you
[1:27:15] <supersugoisenpai1> I failed his quest because he had dragonrot my whole game
[1:27:20] <juxtest> Usually indeed
[1:27:21] <+WordsHere> When I first met this guy I said, "Buddy, that's a ghost"
[1:27:30] <+This_is_Marco> or they turn to goo in a bag
[1:27:35] <+WordsHere> And then he just made me more certain every time I talked to him
[1:27:40] <%Lion_kun> the least straight forward quests are endings 3 and 4
[1:27:42] <+EySoyCoco> imagine walking down the street and seeing some dude with a lifebar
[1:27:50] <th3madness> >kill the npc midquest
[1:27:52] <Sloavon> Billy the Kid
[1:27:52] <MagicHatss> That must have gone interestingly
[1:27:52] <kevinwager> dont
[1:27:55] <worldbrand> surprisingly not this one
[1:27:55] <th3madness> genius
[1:28:03] <Shishi1205> Not a lot of npcs
[1:28:09] <@akuda_bar> so dry
[1:28:10] <Nina96> PUNCHMOM
[1:28:14] <kevinwager> i bet u would not kill the prince
[1:28:14] <th3madness> the assist
[1:28:20] <%Lion_kun> rest woolie
[1:28:22] <$HentaiSenpai9K> @eysoycoco If the dude has one but not me I will steer clear LUL
[1:28:25] <+fatal_penguin_> Is it a "dryer" or a gagged person escaping
[1:28:28] <Shishi1205> Also camera has surprisingly not stopped
[1:28:29] <+tigerfang86> restttttt
[1:28:29] <Intolerable> SAY HI TO PUNCHMOM FOR US
[1:28:30] <definitelynotyakra> You can do it, Woolie. You can defeat the Purple Evil
[1:28:30] <%GabeSweetMan> WOOLIE YOU DIDN'T REST
[1:28:30] <nerdblase> I believe that's Manus.
[1:28:32] <@Menitta> no laundry
[1:28:34] <+WordsHere> I don't think so
[1:28:34] <RoboXGP> No point
[1:28:35] <zk_nails> Sekiro: Cloths Dry Twice
[1:28:38] <+HellCopter> no point
[1:28:41] <RoboXGP> without conffetti unless you're training
[1:28:42] <UnfilteredComic> No confetti = no chance
[1:28:42] <+TheImmortal70> Confetti just makes you do more damage
[1:28:43] <+the_fleeman> Nope
[1:28:45] <$Retrash> I killed him without the confetii. Its not so bad
[1:28:45] <LionShard> he's pretty easy
[1:28:46] <%Dman1500> It is doable, but really long and hard
[1:28:47] <切捨御免> it's doable but jesus christ
[1:28:48] <Parapattern> It is a SLOG without
[1:28:48] <%GabeSweetMan> REST
[1:28:48] <+hax_metatron> Not at this point
[1:28:49] <+Irridium> wait these are the guys you use confetti on?
[1:28:51] <worldbrand> these ones are more manageable than the headless
[1:28:53] <Sloavon> muda muda
[1:28:53] <+EySoyCoco> do it LUL
[1:28:53] <+Nova893> I beat him without confetti
[1:28:54] <+WordsHere> You can only aerial counter deathblow with it
[1:28:55] <+TheImmortal70> Tha'ts not true
[1:28:56] <Djinnazz> you don't need confetti
[1:28:57] <shadow1man9> @WoolieVersus When you have a certain Prosthetic and skill, otherwise naw
[1:28:57] <%Lion_kun> you need at least 3
[1:28:57] <+Nova893> I didn't even know
[1:28:57] <Calek> you can beat it without confetti
[1:28:57] <+Order_of_Mystery> ddo it!
[1:28:58] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I beat him with no confetti
[1:28:59] <%GabeSweetMan> HOW DID HE MISS EVERY REST MESSAGE
[1:28:59] <+bibleianblack> technically doable but rough
[1:29:00] <rararasputino> I did it wihtout, but at the end of the game
[1:29:00] <th3madness> give him a dry run
[1:29:01] <+TheImmortal70> Confetti just increases your damage
[1:29:01] <+Weeewer> ONE GUY
[1:29:02] <tri3dgE027> You cannot kill key NPCs because Okami is forced to sheath his swords in key locations
[1:29:02] <+Dragoneye77> ONE GUY
[1:29:03] <Graxe_> You can fight it to learn it
[1:29:04] <MagicHatss> It's a challenge
[1:29:07] <Divryne> Doable.
[1:29:07] <Treyu000> jermaOneguy
[1:29:08] <Taliesin_> Without confetti the fight will take about 6 times as long.
[1:29:08] <Divryne> SUPER LONG.
[1:29:09] <PinkSocks> You should leave these guys for waay later, it's not worth doing early.
[1:29:09] <%GabeSweetMan> REST
[1:29:09] <+EySoyCoco> straight up kills you
[1:29:11] <SilverAncient> its a slog
[1:29:12] <RoboXGP> you need at least two conffetti you aren't doing it
[1:29:13] <$HentaiSenpai9K> He's Gywndolin
[1:29:13] <+Dragoneye77> you don't gain anything good from fighting him either
[1:29:14] <+Bigmeanjean> killed without confetti, chat just baddies
[1:29:14] <+TheImmortal70> Confetti doesn't help you avoid curse
[1:29:15] <+hax_metatron> @WoolieVersus You get a ton of terror defense items later, try him then!
[1:29:15] <+fatal_penguin_> Long. Hard. Rough. Aching.
[1:29:16] <worldbrand> You don't know what you're not avoiding yet
[1:29:16] <+Dragoneye77> no prayer bead
[1:29:19] <+TheImmortal70> Confetti is purely damage
[1:29:19] <+bibleianblack> oh right terror, you gotta get the purple gourd
[1:29:20] <$Ralfclogs> Rest you nerd
[1:29:20] <mankeyfight> You need item to remove terror
[1:29:20] <+This_is_Marco> you get a tech that lets you execute mid-air and the dude jumps sometimes
[1:29:24] <th3madness> Why do you have to use the confetti on the first run
[1:29:24] <+HellCopter> Confettii has nothing to do with terror
[1:29:25] <energywarning> shimishen TERRORIZE
[1:29:26] <tradingcat17217> Pacify agent
[1:29:26] <b1gboss007> Just don't get hit
[1:29:27] <%GabeSweetMan> REST DANG IT
[1:29:27] <+Irridium> you can totally beat these guys wtthout confetti. There's a bug rock you can hide behind it works fine
[1:29:28] <Rangerman23> check out his movest?
[1:29:30] <Shishi1205> You need a specific tool to make these guys easier
[1:29:30] <LionShard> if you don't learn him, confetti is going to go to waste anyways
[1:29:32] <%KaizenChaos> you come back later
[1:29:32] <+EySoyCoco> the drop is veeery worth tho
[1:29:34] <corepercentlives> Perfect Parry to avoid terror build up
[1:29:34] <+WordsHere> Oof. Only 4. I wouldn't do it, but I'm a coward
[1:29:39] <+Bigmeanjean> sad iim not seen in sfuture
[1:29:45] <%Dman1500> If you just don't get hit by any balls, you don't build terror. No confetti turns the game into a bullet hell @WoolieVersus
[1:29:46] <Truebluemc> at least rest first
[1:29:50] <+Mighty_observer> BUT HOW DO YOU KILL MACHETE MAN!?
[1:29:50] <ProfessorLitmus> let him get the gourd from mibu memorial mob first guys...
[1:29:51] <RoboXGP> you don't even have two confetti, it's not happening
[1:29:51] <tri3dgE027> Confetti can be used to slice through those terrror balls
[1:29:53] <+Bigmeanjean> future
[1:29:54] <+WordsHere> You'll figure out what causes terror pretty quick with that guy
[1:29:54] <mankeyfight> Doesn't have pacifying agent, no go
[1:29:54] <+TheImmortal70> @woolieversus You can grind the pacifying agent off of the folks in the abandoned dungeon
[1:29:57] <+tigerfang86> it's a status
[1:29:59] <+Bigmeanjean> eh
[1:30:01] <%Lion_kun> camera froze?
[1:30:01] <transporterthesequel> It's Frenzy
[1:30:03] <Djinnazz> It's like curse in DS
[1:30:08] <Graxe_> Think Curse from Dark Souls
[1:30:08] <worldbrand> That is incorrect
[1:30:08] <th3madness> incorrect
[1:30:09] <+kungfauxboi> continue on and kill
[1:30:09] <+EySoyCoco> he's not going to rest lol
[1:30:10] <Mendin> It's DS1/3 Curse
[1:30:10] <+Weeewer> this guy has a different gimmick
[1:30:11] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> no
[1:30:13] <corepercentlives> No
[1:30:15] <+TheImmortal70> Headless wasn't either
[1:30:16] <+tigerfang86> THATS WRONG JAY
[1:30:17] <Shishi1205> Nah
[1:30:17] <Divryne> That's just an attack.
[1:30:18] <$Ralfclogs> Did you active the idol?
[1:30:20] <worldbrand> The headless just has a slow aura
[1:30:21] <%KaizenChaos> That's an attack
[1:30:21] <+WhatsGoingInTheToilet> only on hit
[1:30:21] <+TheImmortal70> It was every unperfect parry
[1:30:22] <Better__Days> Time to rest
[1:30:22] <切捨御免> when he's doing his dumb dance standing near him gives you terror
[1:30:22] <Shishi1205> Crazy talked
[1:30:25] <+WordsHere> Actually, technically, you can get terror by standing near this one during certain attacks
[1:30:25] <corepercentlives> Parry for no build up
[1:30:31] <UnfilteredComic> When hes summoning heads he does have an aoe terror field
[1:30:33] <+Irridium> hit the other guy, don't get hit
[1:30:35] <%GabeSweetMan> apatCrazy
[1:30:37] <b1gboss007> He has an aura attack
[1:30:38] <tearknack> @WoolieVersus its a status effect, if you block attacks imperfectly terror effects you - tip - you can parry goku
[1:30:39] <Zeemod155> The bar will fill up both when you get hit and a little bit when you block

[1:58:02] <%robobeau> PROTIP: Don't bother with ghosts until you have the Lilac Umbrella
[1:58:02] <+Grayhammatter> you die if terror goes all the way up

[1:58:07] <Shishi1205> The headless movement thing is the mist @WoolieVersus
[1:58:14] <Dragon_Batman> That isn't terror it's mist
[1:58:17] <+JingKaisean> terror = frenzy
[1:58:18] <+HellCopter> The slowness is just headless
[1:58:19] <fruit_pie_the_magician> No, it just kills you, headless just also has a fuck you field
[1:58:19] <%Alastor21> Alastor21 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:58:25] <%guyalex> headless effects are different than terror
[1:58:26] <ChineseNininga> It's the gimmick of headless
[1:58:28] <@Solidus_113> Headless creates a mist that stops movement
[1:58:28] <%BurncoatRapscallion> Headless are different than Schichiboys
[1:58:28] <Divryne> POISON.
[1:58:29] <%dukenux> Number 1: That's terror.
[1:58:31] <ChineseNininga> The boss initiate the boss fight by spawning a terror zone around him, You would only gain terror naturally by standing around the boss when he is doing this move.
[1:58:32] <+JingKaisean> that's not headless
[1:58:33] <+EySoyCoco> did he rest?
[1:58:33] <Dragon_Batman> This guy os neat
[1:58:34] <tearknack> @WoolieVersus terror has nothing to do with movement, headless have a passive thing (i think the mist?)
[1:58:37] <%dukenux> Number 2: That's terror.
[1:58:39] <+WordsHere> I got here just in time

[1:58:53] <Shishi1205> Terror floor
[1:58:54] <Graxe_> That guy has a Terror aura. Headless have a slow aura.
[1:58:54] <%dukenux> The floor is terror
[1:58:55] <+WordsHere> Not always
[1:58:55] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Yes
[1:58:55] <FkCritter> any blue fire = terror
[1:58:56] <th3madness> woolie he was doing an attack
[1:58:56] <Tremerss> only for that attack
[1:58:57] <+ChunLoArt> It's like the blind leading the blind
[1:58:58] <Shishi1205> While he casts it
[1:58:58] <SpaceGuntank> terror build up=death
[1:58:59] <+Taglog7> Area of Terror
[1:58:59] <transporterthesequel> No that was an attack wollie
[1:59:00] <+HellCopter> Only for that move
[1:59:02] <Mythundare> The floor is lava
[1:59:02] <+tigerfang86> That's a Rune he was casting
[1:59:03] <opiwv> terror is a good band
[1:59:05] <+MoeGap> the umbrella is a godsend in this fight
[1:59:05] <supersugoisenpai1> The strategy for his attacks is just run
[1:59:09] <wsintai> apatCrazy
[1:59:10] <Taliesin_> That AoE gets dispelled if you attack him with Confetti. Without confetti, you just gotta wait for the circle to disappear.
[1:59:10] <fruit_pie_the_magician> ONLY SOMETIMES
[1:59:11] <%Lion_kun> MINH IS 2
[1:59:11] <+Javaa01> Don't stand in the glow
[1:59:13] <%Lion_kun> 2
[1:59:13] <b1gboss007> Only that attack
[1:59:13] <+MoeGap> pop a divine confetti and just wail on him
[1:59:13] <tearknack> @WoolieVersus while he's summoning a circle of evil amgic fire there's terror
[1:59:13] <opiwv> heavy riffs
[1:59:15] <cacophonyhd> AoE attack similar to Foundry Demon or Ebrietas
[1:59:16] <%robobeau> @WoolieVersus There's some ghosts that are doable with the Lical Umbrella... this is not one of them
[1:59:22] <ChineseNininga> This boss initiate the boss fight by spawning a terror zone around him, You would only gain terror naturally by standing around the boss when he is doing this move, it is not a permanent thing
[1:59:22] <%robobeau> *without
[1:59:23] <@Solidus_113> don't touch the purple
[1:59:24] <+WordsHere> You can get special deathblows IF you have divine confetti on
[1:59:25] <%robobeau> Ah fuck
[1:59:26] <+JingKaisean> you need divine confetti to kill him
[1:59:29] <ShutUpAceyP> man Nioh looks good
[1:59:32] <NeroInfinite> Nightmares night mares
[1:59:35] <%robobeau> I didn't even spell Lilac correctly fuck me
[1:59:36] <b1gboss007> CONFFETI THO
[1:59:36] <Dragon_Batman> you can run with those types
[1:59:45] <ProfessorLitmus> just wait until a little bit later when you have the purple mossy gourd
[1:59:50] <Nyckelus> @jingkaisean It’ll make it easier but it’s far from necessary.
[1:59:50] <fruit_pie_the_magician> He is a MASSIVE pain in the ass, but its doable
[2:00:00] <Mythundare> yeah he flies
[2:00:00] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:00:02] <%Alastor21> without the conffeti is not possible for u right now

[2:00:03] <%dukenux> He Jump Good
[2:00:04] <Shishi1205> You should get the purple ninja tool
[2:00:05] <+ChunLoArt> he flies
[2:00:10] <Zeemod155> Oh God is this the new Wesker argument?
[2:00:11] <%robobeau> The Lilac umbrella makes this fight BABY easy
[2:00:12] <%Lion_kun> Divine confetti breaks the AOE
[2:00:12] <Shishi1205> it makes them easier
[2:00:16] <th3madness> Psst
[2:00:20] <Dragon_Batman> Wait a bit until you get some upgrades
[2:00:21] <th3madness> anti-air deathblow
[2:00:25] <Twin_Hallow> yeah usin gitems make that boss easier
[2:00:25] <@akuda_bar> looks fine right now
[2:00:29] <+jojo_teh_bizarre> I mean there's always the jumping deathblow when stuff is floating
[2:00:31] <Zombrocom> Confetti makes the fight a cakewalk, just pop it and hit him until he dies
[2:00:33] <+Bigmeanjean> i didnt continue untill io killed him, wish i was here live ....
[2:00:34] <SpaceGuntank> if it turns off chat will let you know lol

[2:13:19] <%GabeSweetMan> Half health might as well be ONE hit.
[2:13:19] <Flare3500> That grab has a delay to specifically fuck you
[2:13:21] <Dragon_Batman> A hit grab
[2:13:24] <%GabeSweetMan> Always ALWAYS heal to full.

[2:14:01] <%Alastor21> yes
[2:14:02] <+lizard0tm> Parry bullet
[2:14:03] <Dragon_Batman> Yea it's not unblockable
[2:14:04] <%GabeSweetMan> That Leg is a Sword and that Pipe is a Gun.
[2:14:04] <lyzegredjag> ye
[2:14:04] <artsugi1> ES

[2:14:05] <Shishi1205> It has neat timing
[2:14:05] <%Alastor21> u can parry the grab
[2:14:06] <+EySoyCoco> yeah but it's very hard
[2:14:06] <Zombrocom> Yep, 100%
[2:14:07] <RoboXGP> u can't block it but you can parry
[2:14:10] <nmaten> you jsut cant block it
[2:14:10] <eddiemayfly> You can parry every attack as long as you Perfect Parry it.
[2:14:14] <+EySoyCoco> no no the grab mihn
[2:14:14] <supersugoisenpai1> I have never parried the grab
[2:14:15] <+Bigmeanjean> no???
[2:14:15] <%Alastor21> but with good timming
[2:14:16] <%GabeSweetMan> You have to PERFECT parry it though.
[2:14:16] <Taliesin_> You can parry it, but it's risky.
[2:14:19] <+Order_of_Mystery> i dislike how much damage she does...
[2:14:20] <artsugi1> ONLY THIS BOSS
[2:14:20] <MForan98> yeah
[2:14:20] <+TopTieramisu> technically anything can be parried
[2:14:21] <ArthurDoyleRPG> Gun Waifu OP PogChamp
[2:14:22] <ProfessorLitmus> contact medicine + mist raven feathers to bloodbourne around her like a beast
[2:14:24] <%GabeSweetMan> It's way more worthwhile to just dodge or jump it.
[2:14:24] <Inebriateddonut> This one you definitely can
[2:14:25] <PinkSocks> You can perfect parry grabs but it's easier to jump or dodge
[2:14:27] <+This_is_Marco> you can parry her grab
[2:14:27] <+TopTieramisu> it's like peeve's wet dream
[2:14:28] <Shishi1205> U can PARRY not block
[2:14:32] <DeathByPoke7> i hate this enemy
[2:14:34] <Dragon_Batman> Remember the things you can't parry have the kanji symbol
[2:14:36] <KiraKamixephos> The hook back can be parried
[2:14:38] <%Alastor21> is only snake eyes grab that u can parry
[2:14:39] <$Mighty_observer> parry like Tyler
[2:14:42] <GalaxyCrusher> literal woolie bate?
[2:14:42] <shadow1man9> You can parry THIS grab, but you can't block it
[2:14:45] <%GabeSweetMan> You'll still get oneshot at that health.
[2:14:46] <SilverAncient> you can deflect this one
[2:14:47] <RoboXGP> it's a grab with the gun stand
[2:14:47] <tearknack> @SoushinSen only this specific move
[2:14:51] <+Bigmeanjean> im almost sure you can, futile as my coment may be
[2:14:52] <RoboXGP> so it's parryable
[2:14:54] <%BurncoatRapscallion> the parry timing for grabs is so tight
[2:14:54] <mankeyfight> !MOTIVATED
[2:14:54] <@Moobot> 304 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[2:14:55] <Videogamer4> some can be parried some can't it's weird

[2:14:59] <th3madness> stop hopping
[2:15:05] <%GabeSweetMan> ded
[2:15:07] <tearknack> @SoushinSen afaik
[2:15:07] <Parapattern> She does SO MUCH DAMAGE
[2:15:08] <Djinnazz> DIRTY
[2:15:08] <@Menitta> g u n
[2:15:10] <+tigerfang86> G U N
[2:15:11] <eddiemayfly> I'll insist: You can parry EVERY attack, but unblockable attacks you HAVE to Perfect Parry.
[2:15:13] <supersugoisenpai1> Woolie's weakness is gun
[2:15:13] <$Mighty_observer> FF
[2:15:16] <Tucker0603> GUN
[2:15:16] <dabar13> She does so much damage
[2:15:19] <Psyramics> Use a Shinobi Tool to get in after a grab
[2:15:20] <Shishi1205> If I remember correctly she gave pat a bad time too
[2:15:24] <%GabeSweetMan> You need to widdle down health. USE FIRECRACKERS
[2:15:24] <Flare3500> RUSH HER DOWN LIKE A TRUE SHINOBI
[2:15:25] <Taliesin_> Bringing a knife to a gunfight, eh?
[2:15:26] <BestTeaMaker> the power of GUN
[2:15:27] <$Mighty_observer> yeah guns hurt
[2:15:28] <sirrice77> She gives everyone a bad time
[2:15:29] <Dragon_Batman> She does a shit ton of damage yea
[2:15:31] <$Ralfclogs> Woolie is weak to gun
[2:15:32] <mankeyfight> Woolie, remember you have a whole castle to explore
[2:15:36] <$Mighty_observer> just ask Tupac
[2:15:39] <sirrice77> double ichimonji is very good against her though
[2:15:42] <eddiemayfly> O O F
[2:15:43] <KiraKamixephos> One of the toughest mini bosses
[2:15:44] <+WordsHere> Oh. Man... uh... don't know if it's okay to spoil something here, but... not the right way to be going
[2:15:45] <%Alastor21> btw this mini boss is mandatory
[2:15:47] <shadow1man9> You can also cheese this miniboss by leading her into the poison and waiting it out like a coward
[2:15:50] <+lizard0tm> She can be rushed down pretty effectively
[2:15:50] <Nilbanas> poison her in the swamp!!!
[2:15:50] <%GabeSweetMan> Double Ichimonji solves this problem.
[2:15:55] <+fatal_penguin_> Youd think a Shenobi would know how to use a bow, atleast
[2:16:01] <dabar13> Like even getting hit with the gun physically hurts so bad
[2:16:01] <%GabeSweetMan> luckky
[2:16:03] <eddiemayfly> Poison doesn't affect her, AFAIK.
[2:16:09] <sirrice77> @WordsHere anywhere new is the right way
[2:16:22] <Calek> poison absolutely affects her
[2:16:22] <Shishi1205> It does affect her
[2:16:26] <supersugoisenpai1> Stop trying to doge
[2:16:29] <%GabeSweetMan> She CAN get poisoned but it takes foreeeeeeeever.
[2:16:32] <energywarning> good trade good trade
[2:16:32] <+tigerfang86> it affects her INCREDIBLY slowly
[2:16:33] <Shishi1205> She has high resistance
[2:16:33] <Donchalant402> Poison does affect her @eddiemayfly
[2:16:33] <b1gboss007> Fire is good
[2:16:35] <Nilbanas> I killed her with poison
[2:16:35] <mankeyfight> Woolie the castle
[2:16:35] <%GabeSweetMan> You might as well not try.
[2:16:35] <+WzillNJ> man that grab is actually bull
[2:16:35] <Taliesin_> @eddiemayfly It does, it just takes a while to build on her.
[2:16:37] <Ks201> She can be poisoned
[2:16:41] <%dukenux> TOO SLOW
[2:16:43] <Donchalant402> she is actually really weak to poison
[2:16:48] <%juxtest> This is probably the hardest path right now
[2:16:49] <Dragon_Batman> I would suggest the castle area
[2:16:49] <Donchalant402> it leaves her REALLY open
[2:16:50] <Ardyn_1zunia> The guy who did a Sekiro no damage run baited this boss to the fogwall and it was really janky looking
[2:16:53] <$Mighty_observer> just imagine shes Pat and tye gun is zangief
[2:17:01] <Flare3500> the delay is part of the yomi/mindgames
[2:17:07] <%Lion_kun> steal the bar, run for the other guy and then run back
[2:17:08] <sirrice77> @Ardyn_1zunia
[2:17:18] <sirrice77> @Ardyn_1zunia not even chip damage?
[2:17:20] <%GabeSweetMan> NICE
[2:17:21] <Pookiedaexzile> Did he kill the Kratos Reference yet?
[2:17:21] <eddiemayfly> So long buildup? Can't recall ever being able to toxic her in the many times I tried.
[2:17:23] <%Alastor21> u can fight her in the tunnel
[2:17:25] <Foodfordagods> you can swing on the right hand side all the way across to kill that sniper
[2:17:26] <Inebriateddonut> Oh shit that was sweet
[2:17:30] <+fatal_penguin_> Just pretend that Snake Eyes said Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, Woolz
[2:17:30] <%Dman1500> PogChamp NICE
[2:17:30] <dakuman13> Woolie is alive? Sweet
[2:17:30] <%GabeSweetMan> insta-skill point lol
[2:17:45] <%GabeSweetMan> You can go back the original path to de-aggro
[2:17:45] <Ardyn_1zunia> They fought the boss entirely huggin the fog wall so they wouldn't get shot by the other sniper
[2:17:48] <Flare3500> eat a sugar
[2:17:50] <%Alastor21> yes u can
[2:17:56] <energywarning> she does get poison if she stays in the pool for long enough
[2:17:57] <%GabeSweetMan> MINH CRAZY TALK
[2:17:57] <Dragon_Batman> Nah he can still reach it
[2:17:59] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I lured her into the poison to kill her, but it seriously take like a half an hour
[2:18:07] <Taliesin_> CRAZY TALK ACTIVATE
[2:18:10] <$Mighty_observer> da gud camera

[2:18:43] <shadow1man9> @WoolieVersus I have bad news, her aggro range is too huge

[2:18:46] <+NPCMatro> i dot nthink so
[2:18:47] <Psyramics> strealth
[2:18:51] <Foodfordagods> I started from that shrine to get all the stealth kills before mini fight

[2:21:23] <Donchalant402> does woolie have the poison katana subweapon?
[2:21:23] <%GabeSweetMan> LOL
[2:21:23] <nerdblase> @tearknack Southern Ontario has biker gangs, well organized clubs.

[2:21:35] <@Menitta> lol
[2:21:38] <Ardyn_1zunia> oh no
[2:21:39] <th3madness> @WoolieVersus stop dodging, start parrying
[2:21:40] <+EySoyCoco> the ichidodgi
[2:21:49] <%Alastor21> that move but double kills her
[2:21:59] <+jojo_teh_bizarre> F
[2:21:59] <eddiemayfly> Do Not Drop The Shield: The Game
[2:22:04] <candidateplays> This Snake eyes is resistant to posion, so Sabimaru doesn't work as well as the other one.
[2:22:05] <Foodfordagods> start from the shrine in the tunnel, easier to kill adds
[2:22:05] <+ChunLoArt> Good ichimonji
[2:22:06] <ProfessorLitmus> wlooie if you want to try and dodge around everything you need to contact+mist raven
[2:22:06] <$Mighty_observer> FFF
[2:22:08] <+swesterly> you can even parry her grab sweep too just at the last moment
[2:22:09] <TheDr0t> @woolieversus its easier to learn her combo breakers then her moveset
[2:22:09] <sirrice77> dodge towards the shot
[2:22:11] <Psyramics> be aggressive! B E AGGRESSIVE
[2:22:12] <%GabeSweetMan> Snake Eyes was a huge roadblock for me.
[2:22:13] <+Reizie_Etherealm> I wonder if Tenchu is dead as a series
[2:22:14] <%XzileGaming> PERFECT
[2:22:15] <Nina96> Do poison
[2:22:17] <$Mighty_observer> bullets hurt
[2:22:20] <sirrice77> the barrel is past you when you do that
[2:22:21] <Dragon_Batman> I think going back to the castle might be a good idea
[2:22:21] <%Alastor21> hahahah
[2:22:25] <+Order_of_Mystery> half health damage, fuck that
[2:22:31] <tearknack> @nerdblase i was even talking about gangs (my knowledge there is super local), i was just talking about the way black folks talk
[2:22:33] <Pookiedaexzile> Can Kratos be acessed from this point as a boss or is that later with the monkeys
[2:22:34] <+ChunLoArt> Has he fought roof dude?
[2:22:35] <haisho> stealth then bait her back to that camp
[2:22:43] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> just keep swinging in her
[2:22:48] <Dragon_Batman> no he hasn't fought roof boy
[2:22:49] <%GabeSweetMan> Poser-bait
[2:22:52] <eddiemayfly> @Reizie_Etherealm Given that this was supposed to be a Tenchu Reboot, I'd say yes.
[2:22:57] <$Mighty_observer> poser...
[2:22:59] <Dragon_Batman> or at least I haven't seen it
[2:22:59] <+TopTieramisu> ichimonji, the ultimate technique
[2:23:05] <supersugoisenpai1> We still haven't rescued the boi
[2:23:07] <%GabeSweetMan> Be patient with this jerk.
[2:23:12] <Ardyn_1zunia> Attack and parry all at once. Never stop going in
[2:23:15] <Pookiedaexzile> No Not Roofboy, I mean the Big white ape, aka Kratos
[2:23:27] <Flare3500> just install the easy mode hack that makes you 10x faster
[2:23:29] <%GabeSweetMan> Dodging is the WORST thing you can do against her.
[2:23:30] <Shishi1205> Don't drop your sword
[2:23:32] <og_stel> It took me forever to realize you can parry that grab
[2:23:34] <rubbishbinge> Poseurs
[2:23:36] <%GabeSweetMan> Her weapon hitbox is NUTS.
[2:23:37] <Dragon_Batman> ooooh then no kratos has not been seen
[2:23:38] <+NarcissistCactus> I hardly ever dodged in this game
[2:23:48] <%XzileGaming> PERFECT
[2:23:49] <%GabeSweetMan> Never dodge!
[2:23:49] <Ardyn_1zunia> Woolie will continue to fail until he stops dodging away and GETS IN THERE
[2:23:52] <th3madness> paaaaaarrryyyyy
[2:23:52] <eddiemayfly> Shirahagi has given BIG troubles to every streamer I've seen fighting her. Even the Big Parry Boys had a tough one.
[2:23:53] <Unimpressions> If you keep block up it increases your posture recovery
[2:23:54] <Shir0yasha> all her attacks are delayed
[2:23:55] <+DatLatinoGuy> perfect
[2:24:02] <Shishi1205> Don't back up
[2:24:03] <+hax_metatron> You can always come back to her, she's meant for mid game, you;re still early
[2:24:03] <+ChunLoArt> @NarcissistCactus the really doesn't reward you much for dodging :/
[2:24:04] <supersugoisenpai1> Too early
[2:24:06] <Psyramics> Be Aggressive! B E AGGRESSIVE!
[2:24:06] <Parapattern> Jumping is better for getting out of grab range
[2:24:07] <%robobeau> Oh gawd THIS fight
[2:24:07] <+ChunLoArt> game
[2:24:08] <og_stel> hesitation is defeat
[2:24:09] <Shishi1205> mantain the sword up
[2:24:12] <+logoth_> getting posture broken isnt a big deal
[2:24:13] <TheDr0t> @woolieversus offence
[2:24:13] <+jojo_teh_bizarre> Getting closer
[2:24:14] <%robobeau> I did both of her fights back to back because I HATE myself
[2:24:14] <+swesterly> muda muda
[2:24:14] <%XzileGaming> perfect
[2:24:15] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> 2 mistakes allowed
[2:24:15] <%GabeSweetMan> Jump >>>> Dodge
[2:24:16] <+jojo_teh_bizarre> But F
[2:24:18] <+WorldsBestPanda> Man, Woolie has a terrible habit of accidentally double healing upon resurrection.
[2:24:18] <%Lion_kun> woolie block those swings
[2:24:20] <haisho> you can force her to chase you around the little hut where you killed the guys
[2:24:21] <th3madness> this is not bloodborne
[2:24:21] <RoboXGP> i used to jump over her rake
[2:24:26] <Nina96> Do poison
[2:24:28] <+swesterly> nah spam parry dude
[2:24:29] <candidateplays> If you always perfect deflect, you never need to worry about getting posture broken *points finger to head*
[2:24:31] <th3madness> only jump and dodge the grab
[2:24:34] <TheDr0t> spam attack
[2:24:35] <%Lion_kun> no it doesn't, block dancing is a thing
[2:24:39] <Inebriateddonut> Block spamming is still a viable tactic until you get used to the attacks
[2:24:39] <b1gboss007> Castle tho
[2:24:40] <Shir0yasha> spamming guard is actually good
[2:24:45] <Pookiedaexzile> Dat Stare down
[2:24:51] <haisho> yeah actually says that one of the loading screen tips
[2:24:54] <+Pixel_Cafe> @robobeau I fought that, but I still couldn't kill the one from Gun Fort
[2:24:55] <+swesterly> nonsense
[2:24:55] <+ChunLoArt> firecrackers will do the job too
[2:25:02] <+NarcissistCactus> if your posture is about to break just use the mist feather
[2:25:02] <%GabeSweetMan> Spam guarding still protects your health tho.
[2:25:06] <$Mighty_observer> parry window gets smaller
[2:25:08] <+NarcissistCactus> defense becomes trivial
[2:25:09] <+TheBlackMandalorian> Is this anti advice
[2:25:10] <Calek> "That was never a concern for me" what a guy
[2:25:10] <+swesterly> that sounds like some bullshit Pat told you
[2:25:14] <Dragon_Batman> You still get a guard tho
[2:25:14] <+This_is_Marco> But spamming parry is still effective LUL
[2:25:17] <+EySoyCoco> has he done geni?
[2:25:18] <Captain_Aham> not entirely accurate
[2:25:20] <+TopTieramisu> don't spam, but it's better to be blocking than missing the first deflection
[2:25:23] <eddiemayfly> TFW some streamers getting perfect parrys even spamming guard.
[2:25:23] <+ChunLoArt> spam parry always
[2:25:23] <Donchalant402> this is anti-advice, spam parry works
[2:25:26] <$Ralfclogs> That's bs Woolie
[2:25:30] <%BurncoatRapscallion> spamming parry is still a legit strat because missed parries 50% of the time are just blocks
[2:25:30] <+Nova893> ?? Source?
[2:25:31] <+Reizie_Etherealm> @eddiemayfly As a fan of Tenchu right now I can only wish for a port to a platform I can play Tenchu with, cause it's currently only available on platforms I no longer have and it sucks not being able to go back and play
[2:25:31] <+ChunLoArt> posture hardly matters too
[2:25:38] <Intolerable> POISON IS THE KEY
[2:25:38] <+swesterly> absolute nonsense
[2:25:39] <TheDr0t> crazy talk
[2:25:40] <+ChunLoArt> well your own posture
[2:25:42] <+buttdirt> damn, that's interesting
[2:25:46] <Shir0yasha> d OMEGALUL cument
[2:25:48] <Flare3500> Speedrunners literally block spamming errday
[2:25:48] <candidateplays> If you don't learn not to spam parry in the main game, hard mode will drum that into you.
[2:25:50] <+NarcissistCactus> foolishness woolie
[2:25:52] <TheDr0t> noone seen those document
[2:25:55] <+swesterly> spamming parry works fine and the shorter window is negligible
[2:26:04] <+bbHighvalor> nah spam that shit, especially against wolverine
[2:26:04] <+EySoyCoco> get her down there and corner her
[2:26:05] <+This_is_Marco> Woolie is correct, but the game doesnt punish spam parries as much as youd think
[2:26:05] <Flare3500> the document Pat wrote
[2:26:06] <%DeathsDoom> yea but perfect parry only matters once you activate super hard mode lol
[2:26:07] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I hate that parry spam is a thing
[2:26:11] <+TheBlackMandalorian> You can go around theside and climb the hands to stealth kill some of the gun guys
[2:26:13] <Donchalant402> how is woolie at this point and still only has this few amount of gourd seeds
[2:26:19] <+hax_metatron> @WoolieVersus You can totally leave her for lateR!!
[2:26:22] <%Lion_kun> if you mashed block, maybe you'd stop getting hit by those swings
[2:26:22] <+johnchikr> Ey Woolieeee
[2:26:22] <%GohanEgret> put on easy mode Kappa
[2:26:24] <Jackomaning> Maybe dont spam it, but still try to parry evey attack
[2:26:29] <+This_is_Marco> Like the giraffe thing
[2:26:29] <+swesterly> @Flare3500 definitely the document Pat wrote
[2:26:30] <$Mighty_observer> mihn doesn't watch your stupid podcast woolie, hes above that
[2:26:30] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> once you learn the timing of the shots, dodge through them instead of deflecting for the punish. also, the grab is much easier to double jump than it is to dodge
[2:26:31] <eddiemayfly> Parry spamming is super useful against most enemies. Particularly spammy boyes.
[2:26:34] <TheDr0t> @woolieversus just always attack
[2:26:35] <RoboXGP> he's supposed to find Kuro
[2:26:36] <og_stel> gotta punish her with those ichis
[2:26:37] <$Ralfclogs> No that's wrong!
[2:26:39] <Pookiedaexzile> I think From Soft just wants a game where you get teleported in and have to fight the bosses forreal. No spamming, no glitches, you stab dat fat dragon
[2:26:42] <KasiCrafter> What about the Axe? That does a TON of damage?
[2:26:42] <+Order_of_Mystery> go for hp damage then
[2:26:44] <%GabeSweetMan> @Donchalant402 He hasn't completed Castle yet.
[2:26:49] <%Alastor21> the more hp u take away from her the more posture dmg u do
[2:26:55] <+NarcissistCactus> he's speedrunning
[2:26:55] <+tigerfang86> HP damage is the way to go
[2:27:02] <Donchalant402> @GabeSweetMan neither had I at this point, I still had like at least 5 at this point
[2:27:05] <+ChunLoArt> take down hp to slow posture regain
[2:27:08] <Flare3500> we're almost world record bois
[2:27:12] <Parapattern> Parry spamming is useful early on but becomes useless later
[2:27:14] <@Menitta> I'll never get over the big dumb gong sound for stealth kills
[2:27:24] <+swesterly> that don't spam parry advice is a troll and literally sounds like the work of Crazy Talk
[2:27:26] <TheDr0t> granny boss dead?
[2:27:28] <Flare3500> man that speedrunner is insane I feel like next week it'll be sub 20 minutes
[2:27:34] <+DatLatinoGuy> GONG
[2:27:34] <Shir0yasha> just dodge the bullet 4Head
[2:27:36] <%GabeSweetMan> @Donchalant402 But this is the first path. He hasn't gone down any of the other routes.
[2:27:37] <RoboXGP> all parrying does is keep your poise up
[2:27:38] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> health only affects posture regen, not posture damage
[2:27:41] <RoboXGP> you still have to fight
[2:27:44] <%GabeSweetMan> *is his first path
[2:27:51] <%Alastor21> drop the shield
[2:27:54] <mankeyfight> Woolie, please go check out the castle?
[2:27:56] <Inebriateddonut> Well it also damages enemy posture
[2:27:59] <candidateplays> ? parrying is your main way of doing posture damage
[2:27:59] <Videogamer4> double sip Kreygasm
[2:28:02] <Shishi1205> fun fact out of posture break defending is quicker than evading @WoolieVersus
[2:28:02] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[2:28:03] <haisho> pull her back to the hut where you killed the two guys
[2:28:05] <Jackomaning> deflecting damages enemy posture @RoboXGP
[2:28:09] <Flare3500> Wait has Woolie not finished the Ashina Castle ?
[2:28:09] <fruit_pie_the_magician> The spam parry advice to me literally equates to "be bad at the game, it works"
[2:28:16] <TheDr0t> get naked to get rid of fat roll
[2:28:17] <+TopTieramisu> deflections cause posture damage
[2:28:20] <Psyramics> You dont have to be here yet
[2:28:22] <Videogamer4> well seems like he's hit a wall
[2:28:26] <Shir0yasha> hey if it works, it ain't baf
[2:28:26] <Chitoman4> just aggro cannon dude
[2:28:28] <+TopTieramisu> it's important for getting early death blows
[2:28:30] <%GabeSweetMan> Also I don't know if he has grinded the coin to buy the merchant Gourd seeds.
[2:28:30] <Donchalant402> @GabeSweetMan There are a few merchants already that he could have gotten a gourd seed
[2:28:31] <shotgang86> everytime I see a stream f this game and they get to this part, this mini-boss makes them be stuck for like 3 hours
[2:28:33] <TheDr0t> TARKUS!
[2:28:35] <Zeemod155> LUL
[2:28:37] <og_stel> LuL
[2:28:38] <%XzileGaming> PERFECT
[2:28:40] <eddiemayfly> enbDanger enbDanger enbDanger
[2:28:43] <shotgang86> and just because of that grab
[2:28:44] <+NarcissistCactus> very good
[2:28:45] <tearknack> @WoolieVersus @SoushinSen as the tutorial of the game (that undying dude) says dodging is good against high health enemies. parrying and deflecting wont do anything but block attacks until her health is lower
[2:28:46] <RoboXGP> If they hit you so bad you feint you can dodge out of it and COMPLETELY regain all of your posture
[2:28:49] <TheDr0t> TARKUS
[2:28:57] <Pookiedaexzile> Am I gonna be the one to say it
[2:29:01] <+swesterly> lol i beat sword saint by spam parry, like obviously you have to try to time as best you can because if it isn't a perfect parry you take posture damage but it's worth it to spam tbh the posture damage you deal by perfect parry is so worth it
[2:29:02] <Flare3500> wait we were saving time ?
[2:29:02] <Dragon_Batman> yup
[2:29:03] <Nina96> So do poison
[2:29:07] <Pookiedaexzile> YOU HAVE TO HIT HER WOOLIE
[2:29:08] <+buttdirt> jump kick man
[2:29:15] <$Mighty_observer> who said that i wonder
[2:29:16] <alexandrecau> Nothing waste time like being bad
[2:29:17] <%GabeSweetMan> Jump kick works on the grab.
[2:29:22] <+This_is_Marco> you cant spam parry in Mibu village thats for sure
[2:29:24] <Zeemod155> There are other places you can be right now if you want a change of scenery
[2:29:31] <Nina96> yes
[2:29:36] <%GabeSweetMan> Nothing wastes time when you're a gun jumper like Liam.
[2:29:37] <Shishi1205> easy
[2:29:39] <Nina96> it has
[2:29:51] <%UrsulaCat> damn right I'm gonna hit that
[2:29:52] <%GabeSweetMan> LOL
[2:29:54] <+CJett92> s p e e d
[2:29:54] <+TopTieramisu> in the back
[2:29:55] <Donchalant402> @WoolieVersus remember, she DOESN'T loose aggro, so you loose nothing by getting the stealth deathblow on her and backing off and killing the guys around her
[2:29:56] <+VanaSkiller> oof
[2:29:56] <og_stel> does woolie have sabimaru?
[2:29:56] <RoboXGP> NICE
[2:29:56] <shotgang86> oof
[2:29:56] <Shishi1205> You need to deal actual dmg
[2:29:58] <+tigerfang86> SNIPED
[2:30:01] <Flare3500> shot in the back like a true shinobi
[2:30:01] <PerfectAsymmetry> Sniped LUL
[2:30:05] <+Reizie_Etherealm> This game is about hitting different walls and seeing which one you can climb over at your current state
[2:30:08] <Donchalant402> *lose
[2:30:12] <DeathByPoke7> counterhits hurt
[2:30:15] <TheDr0t> THATS RIGHT GET NOSCOPED!
[2:30:15] <%GabeSweetMan> XD
[2:30:18] <RoboXGP> 1 and 2,
[2:30:21] <RoboXGP> not 1,2
[2:30:25] <+DangerMan83> Gotta admit I took the Billy route on this fight, and I don't regret a damned thing lol
[2:30:34] <ChineseNininga> just whack on her like any other regular human enemy Woolie
[2:30:40] <kikosmore> Whiff punishing is how I beat this enemy.
[2:30:42] <eddiemayfly> Trivia: All Snake Eyes (except maybe the shotgun ones) are females, as they're inspired by the Butchers.
[2:30:43] <+TopTieramisu> a block is infinitely better than a late deflection
[2:30:44] <+hax_metatron> She is meant for mid game! Woolie is still in the early game!!! Why throw yourself against her! Just come back Woolie you have other areas
[2:30:46] <shadow1man9> Might wanna come back after getting more HP and Posture. Or just poison cheese
[2:30:48] <og_stel> gotta chip the health down
[2:30:50] <+tigerfang86> JUST WIN
[2:30:52] <+tigerfang86> NOTHING ELSE
[2:30:52] <%GabeSweetMan> Whiff punishing is SUPER strong on this enemy.
[2:30:55] <Nyckelus> This mini-boss can be very easily put into a loop. She has about 3 or 4 attacks that she will do over and over again which you can deflect or dodge.
[2:30:56] <RoboXGP> I never sneaked attacked this enemy i fought her staight up
[2:30:57] <Nina96> A
[2:30:58] <+This_is_Marco> Chat, is the window to parry from block smaller than a neutral stance parrying outright?
[2:31:04] <%GabeSweetMan> Ichimonji on a grab whiff does LOTS of health damage.
[2:31:06] <dabar13> I managed to actually fight her but not after an hour of trail and error
[2:31:07] <Flare3500> @WoolieVersus Fight back woolie when you deflect her your on plus frames that means time to attack
[2:31:15] <Muzzles56> @hax_metatron dont be a bitch, fight this hoe
[2:31:20] <+TopTieramisu> @This_is_marco no. spamming the deflection lowers the active window of deflection
[2:31:21] <%GabeSweetMan> Thanks lock on!
[2:31:21] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Oh I poison cheesed this bitch. But parry spam is a step too far, not learning how to play properly was a step I wasn't willing to take
[2:31:28] <Shir0yasha> i beat her first try. umbrella cheese
[2:31:33] <TheDr0t> i cheesed her on top if the house thingy
[2:31:34] <haisho> the hut itself is fine
[2:31:41] <%GabeSweetMan> Umbrella is a good counter yes.
[2:31:43] <RoboXGP> @GabeSweetMan that's nothing, that's just animation, a block is a property, a parry is a deflect and keeps your poise from dropping
[2:31:51] <+EySoyCoco> oops
[2:31:53] <rolothakid> Sup cuh!
[2:31:56] <Donchalant402> completely fucked up
[2:31:58] <Dragon_Batman> YEa just dodge and kil everyone else, easy
[2:31:58] <Parapattern> LUL
[2:31:58] <Donchalant402> gg
[2:31:59] <ChineseNininga> attack her and stop giving her chances to shoot you
[2:32:01] <+tigerfang86> U FUKED UP
[2:32:03] <+tigerfang86> U FUKKED UP
[2:32:06] <Nina96> B
[2:32:06] <supersugoisenpai1> That guy wasn't even aggroed, you made it worse
[2:32:10] <og_stel> I used gachi sugar to take out all the minions
[2:32:13] <Dragon_Batman> not easy is the truth
[2:32:15] <+This_is_Marco> @TopTieramisu Holding block, and parrying once vs parrying once without holding. Do the 2 have the same window to parry?
[2:32:23] <Donchalant402> sugar that shit woolie
[2:32:24] <Parapattern> She is laser accurate with that cannon
[2:32:25] <+Irridium> see what I did was get the shadow puppet jutsu, convert a ton of the adds in the area, and watch as they whooped her ass
[2:32:25] <Pookiedaexzile> Why don't you use YOUR gun
[2:32:28] <shadow1man9> Stay on top of the cliff
[2:32:35] <TheDr0t> @og_stel gachiGASM
[2:32:36] <+TopTieramisu> @This_is_marco pretty sure it's the same, if not negligibly different
[2:32:38] <+DangerMan83> She does, this is where I poison scummed here
[2:32:39] <RoboXGP> @This_is_marco yes if you do it once
[2:32:40] <+ChunLoArt> oh the cheese
[2:32:41] <%GabeSweetMan> @RoboXGP I'm uncertain what statement you're replying to.
[2:32:56] <Flare3500> This is the shinobi way
[2:32:57] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> using a stealth sugar is helpful for taking out the goons here
[2:32:59] <+starzo0> billy is a cheese connoisseur, he knows what hes talking about @WoolieVersus
[2:32:59] <Muzzles56> ResidentSleeper
[2:32:59] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Blackness covers all I see and all I touch. No feeling of pain just sorrow. My hand loses grip of the sword I held. And I turn to become a true shadow.
[2:33:01] <Nyckelus> @roboxgp False. Even deflections take up posture. Just much less so.
[2:33:04] <haisho> mooks don't do hard chases
[2:33:06] <Pookiedaexzile> She's poisoned
[2:33:14] <+TopTieramisu> also, even deflections can cause posture damage to yourself. you'll just never get your posture broken
[2:33:15] <%GabeSweetMan> Stop dodging!
[2:33:17] <UnfilteredComic> You cheated not only the
[2:33:20] <Pookiedaexzile> Run woolie, you'll win a cowards victory
[2:33:21] <+This_is_Marco> @TopTieramisu Cool, thanks. Curious if in some cases its better to hold and parry when anticipating the next move
[2:33:21] <RoboXGP> I know I'm trying to pretend the game is easy
[2:33:27] <%Solidnick18> ded
[2:33:27] <RoboXGP> you gotta roll sometimes
[2:33:28] <%GabeSweetMan> STOP DODGING WOOLIE.
[2:33:30] <+duskrush> If you're gonna go for posture break you have to be aggressive
[2:33:34] <Nina96> Just do poison woolie
[2:33:35] <+EySoyCoco> maybe it's early too
[2:33:37] <Shishi1205> don't trade woolie, you lose those
[2:33:37] <ChineseNininga> punish her gunshots
[2:33:42] <ChineseNininga> pressure her Woolie
[2:33:43] <%GabeSweetMan> Dodge sucks in this. JUMP is what you want.
[2:33:44] <Shir0yasha> theres no honor in being a shinobi
[2:33:45] <bigboy3d> Be aggressive
[2:33:46] <og_stel> if anything dodge the bunshots
[2:33:46] <cacophonyhd> Just face-tank everything Kappa
[2:33:49] <ProfessorLitmus> does he know you recover posture faster by guarding?
[2:33:50] <Donchalant402> @WoolieVersus the only time to dodge is when she does her grab
[2:33:50] <haisho> Channel your inner Royal Guard
[2:33:51] <supersugoisenpai1> Every moment dodging means you can't guard
[2:33:52] <+TopTieramisu> @This_is_marco defense is no. 1 imo. trying to be an expert deflection isn't worth it until you're used to the moveset
[2:33:52] <TheDr0t> can someone tell wolie that bloking recover posture faster?
[2:33:52] <+ChunLoArt> Your own posture doesn't really matter much
[2:33:54] <+swesterly> spam parry, trust me there is no downside
[2:33:54] <candidateplays> You can dodge the gunshots.
[2:33:55] <+unfamous2423> Did you know you can parry the bullets? @WoolieVersus
[2:33:57] <Shishi1205> fun fact out of posture break defending is quicker than evading @WoolieVersus
[2:34:07] <kikosmore> Exactly dodge the gunshot then attack. Also dodge the grab then attack. Those are the easiest points to get a hit in.
[2:34:08] <+Sendaar> You get punished so rarely for your posture breaking it doesnt really matter
[2:34:10] <+TopTieramisu> deflecter*
[2:34:13] <Muzzles56> those firecrackers look nice
[2:34:15] <+zanzibar_junker> axe her
[2:34:17] <ChineseNininga> Woolie you have to hit em
[2:34:24] <Nyckelus> @woolieversus You can get the boss in a loop of 3 or 4 attacks which you can deflect or dodge and counter.
[2:34:26] <%juxtest> Try fighting someone else in
[2:34:28] <Flare3500> Just don't die korean advice
[2:34:34] <%juxtest> Stead
[2:34:35] <RoboXGP> you regain your stance if you lose posture you can just roll out of it
[2:34:36] <+TopTieramisu> i really hope the DLC adds more enemies that punish posture breaks
[2:34:38] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> whats the last main boss woolie beat? he might be underleveld for this
[2:34:38] <+swesterly> you can parry that grab sweep at the last minute woolie
[2:34:47] <kikosmore> She shoots everytime after the kick.
[2:34:48] <TheDr0t> just don't get hit
[2:34:48] <%GabeSweetMan> Thanks camera
[2:34:53] <+EySoyCoco> get her down there
[2:34:57] <Dragon_Batman> Looked like you paniced
[2:34:58] <Pookiedaexzile> Try having fun and feeling good about your life, not advice for the game just for life in general
[2:35:01] <Nina96> C
[2:35:03] <Donchalant402> @WoolieVersus when she does her grab dodge back and immediately dodge slash, gets her every time
[2:35:04] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:35:05] <Shishi1205> fun fact out of posture break defending is quicker than evading @WoolieVersus Its what you should try in this case
[2:35:06] <+zanzibar_junker> slash twice axe and follow up
[2:35:07] <supersugoisenpai1> You can just go back to Ashina castle
[2:35:09] <Flare3500> be Faker
[2:35:12] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> you can dodge through shots, since deflecting them doesn't do posture damage to her and it's not that hard when her bullet hitbox is going the opposite direction you are. @WoolieVersus
[2:35:13] <candidateplays> He's def underleveled, he hasn't beaten Genichiro, I think
[2:35:14] <haisho> camera isn't great when next to a wall. I learned that the hard way with Guardian Ape
[2:35:14] <tearknack> @WoolieVersus every time you block her or successfully dodge her attacks, try and get a hit in. you keep holding block for a second before moving back in
[2:35:14] <Inebriateddonut> Breakaway rolls do lessen the posture break window but if you break in one of their combos you're gonna get hit
[2:35:14] <%Lion_kun> maybe block instead of running away
[2:35:16] <Muzzles56> her grabs are 1+2 block
[2:35:17] <og_stel> most enemies dont really punish posture break
[2:35:19] <RoboXGP> you can parry the rakes woolie or just jump
[2:35:21] <eddiemayfly> Chat peoples, I need to be aware: Tips are provideable or this is a hard No-No?
[2:35:21] <+Sendaar> She's weak to the sabimaru if that helps
[2:35:24] <TheDr0t> @woolieversus attack to learn her counters
[2:35:25] <+DangerMan83> 4 gourds is really early to be doing this fight, dont get discouraged you got this
[2:35:30] <kikosmore> @candidateplays he can beat her though
[2:35:50] <CrypticMochi> Does that kick have a stun or something? I keep seeing people getting hit by the shot after it.
[2:35:51] <shadow1man9> This is also an enemy that is definitely a "You're supposed to do this later" type of enemy
[2:35:51] <Parapattern> @WoolieVersus There are other, easier places that you can go before fighting her, Woolie. Level up and come back later.
[2:35:55] <%GabeSweetMan> @eddiemayfly Tips are being read, yes.
[2:35:55] <candidateplays> @kikosmore You can beat anyone in this game at a base level.
[2:36:03] <ChineseNininga> Try sprinting away next time if you really want to dodge desperately out of a corner
[2:36:10] <+This_is_Marco> @WoolieVersus youre fine man, this mini boss is an actual wall and stopped a lot of progress for people
[2:36:14] <Pookiedaexzile> This is the only ninja game, where people play like samurai and ask "what happun"
[2:36:24] <kikosmore> @candidateplays He's doing enough damage and has enough gourds to survive. That's my point.
[2:36:26] <%GabeSweetMan> This miniboss was absolutely a wall for me.
[2:36:27] <+TheBlackMandalorian> parry more dodge less
[2:36:28] <ChineseNininga> it doesn't give you an i-frame but you move so fast while sprinting that you could literally just outrun anything
[2:36:34] <+bbHighvalor> Use fireworks
[2:36:36] <Donchalant402> @WoolieVersus you keep guarding after you dodge her grab, counter her grab with a dodge slash instead
[2:36:36] <Pookiedaexzile> you are out matched, cheat, throw shit in their eyes, and set shit on fire
[2:36:37] <eddiemayfly> @GabeSweetMan Much of the thanks, friend.
[2:36:41] <EVA_Unit02> LUL
[2:36:41] <%GabeSweetMan> This is the miniboss that taught me jump >>>>>>> dodge
[2:36:41] <%juxtest> This is like doing Tomb of the Giants before Blighttown
[2:36:49] <%GabeSweetMan> LOL thanks wall!
[2:36:50] <+kgfsjholis> Is that Minh T. beside you?!
[2:36:56] <+KyroDragon> @WoolieVersus Yo you got it!
[2:36:57] <haisho> yeyeye this is how I killed her. If I need to heal I move out of her LoS by using the hut

[2:37:26] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> dodge through shots (towards her), jump the grabs. dodging shots is super easy if you go towards her
[2:37:27] <%GohanEgret> BigPhish
[2:37:27] <+TopTieramisu> this is like the strat hob uses for his BB run against gascoigne
[2:37:27] <Flare3500> that's it like a true shinobi... nevermind
[2:37:30] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> it can work if ur good
[2:37:31] <Shishi1205> New types of cheese on stream
[2:37:32] <Shir0yasha> thats a rotten cheese
[2:37:32] <haisho> Don't cheese, the ramp is bad
[2:37:36] <haisho> I tried
[2:37:39] <Pookiedaexzile> Woolie she has the highground
[2:37:39] <Dawnchaser_Twitch> @WoolieVersus That was some Dairy Schemes.
[2:37:39] <%Lion_kun> if you're gonna cheese, use the swamp
[2:37:40] <tearknack> @WoolieVersus there's no point in blocking shots, because you don't do parry damage. dodign and attacking out of the dodge is better
[2:37:41] <%GabeSweetMan> Cheese innovation
[2:37:42] <EVA_Unit02> She had the high ground!
[2:37:42] <+Tusktuki> That wasn't Gouda Cheese
[2:37:45] <Donchalant402> @GabeSweetMan opposite for me actually, I'd say this is the point where I GOT reflects
[2:37:45] <+swesterly> hesitation is defeat
[2:37:46] <+Tusktuki> ...I will see myself out
[2:37:46] <+DangerMan83> if you want to cheese just poison her, its only 5min if you get the first stab in lol
[2:37:48] <%Zombino924> WOOLIE. please go BACK to the CASTLE

[2:38:25] <TheDr0t> there is no pdf
[2:38:28] <Pookiedaexzile> Still play like samurai
[2:38:31] <%guyalex> you'll get it, she's rough on everyone's first try. it's worth learning it proper though
[2:38:39] <+ChunLoArt> Stop looking at the pdf
[2:38:39] <%GabeSweetMan> But I was getting rekt'd by her grab. Thus I learned dodging wasn't as worthwhile as jumping.
[2:38:40] <Muzzles56> the pdf content is just "mash l1"
[2:38:41] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> this game favours aggression heavily
[2:38:41] <$Mighty_observer> MIHN is disappointed
[2:38:48] <Donchalant402> @GabeSweetMan Genichiro was the last thing I did after the game opened up
[2:38:50] <Jackomaning> Seems like Woolie opts to block more than he does deflect
[2:38:52] <Shir0yasha> fuck em dude, we just wanna win
[2:38:54] <+bbHighvalor> @WoolieVersus Jump on her when shes grabs, firework her, ichi her once
[2:38:55] <+zocano> He ain't wrong; you want to be aggressive
[2:38:55] <Donchalant402> I did literally everything else first
[2:38:56] <+unfamous2423> Deflecting the kick is a good amount of posture damage
[2:38:57] <supergoober33> Getting aggressive is optimal, plus her "grab" can actually be deflected.
[2:38:58] <Nina96> D
[2:39:02] <Inebriateddonut> They want you to be aggressive in combat, but outside of it you can do what you want
[2:39:02] <+ChunLoArt> has he used the firecrackers on her yet?
[2:39:02] <Dragon_Batman> This game is all about aggression
[2:39:06] <transporterthesequel> If she's not doing an unblockable wollie, just stay in and swinging
[2:39:07] <Shishi1205> fun fact out of posture break defending is quicker than evading @WoolieVersus Its what you should try in this case
[2:39:07] <%Lion_kun> woolie, stop trading
[2:39:07] <%GabeSweetMan> Seems you're not the only one @Donchalant402
[2:39:09] <+vinnysuperg123> I hate this chick
[2:39:09] <gustavozxd> Billy's playthrough must've been something something huh
[2:39:10] <+TheBlackMandalorian> you can parry the gunshots
[2:39:10] <+TopTieramisu> this game feels like a better implementation of incentivizing aggression that bloodborne was trying to do
[2:39:15] <Pookiedaexzile> You know who know how to play games best? the creators, Thats why all the Evo champs are Capcom employees
[2:39:16] <og_stel> use the ash
[2:39:21] <transporterthesequel> parry her non unblockable shit
[2:39:23] <+zanzibar_junker> use the axe dammit
[2:39:24] <Flare3500> throw that document in the recycling bin
[2:39:25] <+ChunLoArt> use the firecrackers
[2:39:26] <haisho> grab needs to be perfect deflected though so I just dodge > Nightjar
[2:39:27] <TheDr0t> @woolieversus attack to learn counters
[2:39:33] <Professor_Rakor> So, on a scale of one to dead, how twice are these shadows?
[2:39:33] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Be whatever you have to be, do whatever you have to do. The end goal is to win and if being aggressive gets you there then so be it
[2:39:34] <tearknack> @WoolieVersus to put this in fighting game terms, you've got to punish after you block
[2:39:38] <Nina96> E
[2:39:40] <%juxtest> Strike her with your violence
[2:39:43] <shadow1man9> @WoolieVersus If I remember right if you parry one of her side swipes if you quickly Ichimonji you can loop her
[2:39:44] <+starzo0> just mikiri counter her 4Head
[2:39:45] <Donchalant402> @WoolieVersus deflect more, only dodge the grab, when dodging grab do the dodge slash
[2:39:51] <+zanzibar_junker> slash slash axe
[2:39:56] <og_stel> FIRECRACKERS
[2:40:04] <Analogflame> I ran past alot of people Kappa
[2:40:10] <Flare3500> The Ashina Style is play to win it's in their code , doesn't matter how you win
[2:40:13] <+TopTieramisu> i wish they made poison more viable. would make an alternative strat less tedious
[2:40:14] <+Reizie_Etherealm> The range on that grab tho
[2:40:15] <Pookiedaexzile> Everybody shut up, This isn't a game about ninjas, Woolie wan'ts to be vergil
[2:40:16] <haisho> hit and run can work but it's typically for enemies that's can't block or deflect
[2:40:21] <Pookiedaexzile> Let him samruai
[2:40:25] <+WordsHere> Just got to and beat her while watching... On my second playhthrough Kappa
[2:40:28] <gustavozxd> according to Pat you just learn to parry everything and the game becomes easy
[2:40:29] <Shir0yasha> just press deflect at the right time just like rhythm game 4Head
[2:40:31] <+zanzibar_junker> the axe fucks her up
[2:40:33] <SilverAncient> kill ingeniously
[2:40:35] <+duskrush> Hit and run is better for larger enemies
[2:40:39] <Nina96> F
[2:40:41] <Donchalant402> @gustavozxd he isnt wrong
[2:40:41] <$jobbedbone> that combo
[2:40:42] <Inebriateddonut> @Pookiedaexzile you can even literally be vergil with a certain combat art
[2:40:46] <Analogflame> just hit them till their hp is 0. that easy
[2:40:46] <tearknack> he keeps holding block foor a second
[2:40:47] <supersugoisenpai1> You can not
[2:40:50] <Videogamer4> maybe woolie should save her for later
[2:40:54] <Donchalant402> the game becomes easier when you realize you can spam deflect
[2:40:55] <egggggggggggggggggggggg> does woolie know you can parry the grab instead of dodging it? a lot more reliable in my opinion
[2:40:56] <Shishi1205> side dogde
[2:40:58] <Mendin> Her grapple is a weird thing where you have to dodge and then parry
[2:41:05] <$Mighty_observer> camera combo
[2:41:10] <+This_is_Marco> honestly idk, hit and run was a good strategy early game. But around here it just makes you learn bad habits
[2:41:11] <ChineseNininga> It is guarantee Woolie you just have to dodge late
[2:41:11] <+Ecchigun> @WoolieVersus never give up
[2:41:13] <ChineseNininga> real late
[2:41:16] <Nyckelus> @gustavozxd He’s not wrong though. Perfect deflects and then countering will takeoff a decent chunk of enemy posture.
[2:41:16] <Shishi1205> Its a grab
[2:41:18] <supersugoisenpai1> You are smashing your head against an enemy you're not meant to fight yet
[2:41:19] <supergoober33> Don't wait for enemies to start attacking, you gain nothing by doing so apart from chances to get hit. If there's a break in the combat, just start swinging yourself.
[2:41:21] <Dragon_Batman> The grab is not a sweep
[2:41:23] <%juxtest> Use the tac-nuke shinobi tool
[2:41:26] <+TopTieramisu> @Mendin ??? there's only one hit in her grab
[2:41:27] <Sloavon> still in this cave LUL
[2:41:28] <og_stel> not a sweep
[2:41:30] <candidateplays> "Play to win, no matter what" is the motto of the Sengoku era in general, Honor as anything other than loyalty to your liege was created in the edo period
[2:41:30] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> finna have more trouble with this dood than the final boss
[2:41:33] <Pookiedaexzile> @Inebriateddonut Weird how thats only 1 move outta 100 options
[2:41:35] <+tigerfang86> imagine thinking he can't beat this guy
[2:41:36] <+tigerfang86> girl
[2:41:38] <DeathByPoke7> how about enemy stepping her
[2:41:40] <%GabeSweetMan> My order through the game was Castle -> Genichiro -> Hit this wall with Snake Eyes and left -> Senpou Temple -> Came back here -> Mibu Village -> Gun Fort/Sunken Valley -> Rest of game
[2:41:41] <Muzzles56> crackers PogChamp
[2:41:43] <kikosmore> Side step the kick and dodge the gun shot then attack. Whiff punish the Grab.
[2:41:49] <+NobleJedi> this boss was so annoyinng
[2:41:53] <Donchalant402> How the hell does her get her completely open with the firecracker then NOT attack
[2:41:55] <Pookiedaexzile> Yes
[2:41:55] <Sloavon> crackers? cmonBruh
[2:42:00] <Pookiedaexzile> He's doing it

[2:42:13] <%BurncoatRapscallion> please dont be like Pat and use the holding stab attack
[2:42:13] <+zanzibar_junker> use it
[2:42:14] <%GabeSweetMan> YAA use those prosthetics.
[2:42:18] <$jobbedbone> try to remember the basics of being a Nobru Shinobru
[2:42:20] <haisho> he's probably not used to firecrackers
[2:42:22] <+TopTieramisu> see? these hits in neutral should not happen
[2:42:27] <%Lion_kun> woolie block
[2:42:27] <+zanzibar_junker> slash slash axe
[2:42:28] <+Reizie_Etherealm> I've said this before but I can never get this sentiment right cause of my poor phrasing but I'll try again
[2:42:32] <%BurncoatRapscallion> the stab attack is useless for anyone but basic enemies
[2:42:32] <Nyckelus> @supergoober33 Definitely. You attack once then he enemy attacks with one of there starting chains and then you deflect.
[2:42:37] <+Hylian726> to be fair I don't the game ever tells you to hold r1 for a stab
[2:42:41] <tearknack> @WoolieVersus you keep talking about being aggressive, but you aren't being aggressive. drop your metaphorical shield, punish after her strings finish, dodge gunshots because parrying them doesn't do posture damage to her
[2:42:49] <%Lion_kun> it's okay if she breaks your guard on the 3rd swing, she doesn't have a follow up
[2:42:51] <kikosmore> lol
[2:42:52] <gustavozxd> nioh has a hara Kiri sword and the description says "loses all your amrita (nioh"s version of souls) but retains your honor" I love that LUL
[2:42:57] <Flare3500> oh yeah I think I spammed the stab attack because the range is jsut so good
[2:43:02] <TheDr0t> does her kick condidered a stab attack?
[2:43:08] <Shishi1205> @SoushinSen You can parry the grab when you see her lunge the hook at you

[2:44:25] <tearknack> you should have run back a pit and used some pills woolie
[2:44:26] <+TheBlackMandalorian> You can stealth kill everyone in the room by going up the hands to the right then coming back around for snake eyes
[2:44:28] <DeathByPoke7> YOU CAN DO IT
[2:44:29] <Donchalant402> @WoolieVersus you lured her away before, why dont you do it again
[2:44:30] <%GabeSweetMan> You can do it though!
[2:44:31] <gustavozxd> the jobber ruined it all
[2:44:32] <Professor_Rakor> You can fight here near the fog door to be a bit safer.
[2:44:33] <kikosmore> Yeah really gotta dodge those gunshots after her combos. Free hits.
[2:44:33] <Donchalant402> dont fight there
[2:44:36] <dabar13> You got this man!
[2:44:38] <MustBeColin> CarlSmile
[2:44:39] <shadow1man9> Might want to not fight her where those two guys can see you
[2:44:42] <kikosmore> You got it dude.
[2:44:44] <Videogamer4> @woolieversus lure her into the cave
[2:44:45] <+hax_metatron> Fight near the fog door way easier
[2:44:46] <og_stel> no theres two guys woolie
[2:44:47] <supergoober33> @WoolieVersus Good aggression that time, you can back up into the cave so other guys don't come around
[2:44:47] <+unfamous2423> @Shishi1205 I found the grab deflect timing to be too hard
[2:44:49] <%GabeSweetMan> Woolie is jumping more often! That's a GOOD habit over dodging all over.
[2:44:49] <supersugoisenpai1> Fight her on your terms
[2:45:01] <Zeemod155> The guy from the island usually doesn't get agro'd it's the guy from the cliff that does
[2:45:06] <+Hylian726> jumping is not really a good habit tbh
[2:45:07] <Shishi1205> Still trying it is a chance
[2:45:10] <$jobbedbone> I love this stream dynamic LUL
[2:45:13] <+Nova893> Pellets?
[2:45:14] <Dragon_Batman> This spot might do
[2:45:15] <%GabeSweetMan> Dragging her out here is definitely more manageable.
[2:45:17] <ArthurDoyleRPG> Must. Kill. All.
[2:45:19] <Donchalant402> juming is a bad habit
[2:45:27] <%GabeSweetMan> How is jumping a bad habit?
[2:45:28] <haisho> @GabeSweetMan Actually it's a bad idea here. You take more damage from projectiles if you're in the air and you take a LOT of damage from these guys
[2:45:30] <Flare3500> I got caught with the grab while jumping it looked cool before I died
[2:45:31] <Donchalant402> its not something you should do often
[2:45:33] <Muzzles56> just FBBlock
[2:45:36] <supergoober33> Once you get High Monk you never need to jump again :)

[2:46:00] <Shir0yasha> high monk gives you extra style points
[2:46:12] <+Binary_Fireball> this guy is easy with the right move... how much backseating is allowed right now?
[2:46:20] <Dragon_Batman> He sometimes takes a peak in between deaths
[2:46:21] <supergoober33> Plus it does ridiculous posture damage if you counter a sweep with it. It destroys even the final boss
[2:46:24] <Donchalant402> @GabeSweetMan time wasted jumping away is a chance you had to dodge away and dodge slash
[2:46:32] <%GabeSweetMan> Jumping gives you a ton more I-frames in the start up though.
[2:46:33] <dabar13> Guys just let him do his thing
[2:46:37] <Shishi1205> I mean double Ichi is very good vs her
[2:46:39] <kikosmore> He's not listening much. He's still trying to block bullets instead of dodging the.
[2:46:47] <Shishi1205> ANd firecrackers do cancel her grab
[2:46:47] <+NarcissistCactus> you don't need i frames if you're dodging a bullet
[2:46:53] <Shishi1205> You have done it before
[2:46:56] <%Crosscottonwood> Crosscottonwood subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! u are the bestest woolie
[2:47:01] <%GabeSweetMan> It's a trade off. One is not necessarily better than the other but in terms of not getting HIT, I find jumping to be the better tactical decision.
[2:47:08] <Restainly> is this NG+
[2:47:17] <Nina96> no
[2:47:19] <Dragon_Batman> No he is still early
[2:47:23] <tearknack> @WoolieVersus you keep talking about being aggressive, but you aren't being aggressive. drop your metaphorical shield, punish after her strings finish, dodge gunshots because parrying them doesn't do posture damage to her. you keep holding block when you have full posture and could be attacking

[2:47:27] <Shir0yasha> NG -

[2:47:38] <+NarcissistCactus> nice essay
[2:47:39] <Shishi1205> @SoushinSen You can parry the grab when you see her lunge the hook at you

[2:47:46] <+Derock123> woolie vs grandma swamp
[2:47:47] <+Hylian726> both jumping and dodging are kinda bad unless you use them at specific times. the game heavily encourages deflecting and attacking over jump and dodge
[2:47:52] <kikosmore> lol
[2:47:54] <kakdela7> charged r1 is underrated

[2:48:37] <$jobbedbone> getting health down a bit lowers their posture regen, right?
[2:48:37] <caol2017> NO DIGNITY
[2:48:40] <Nina96> your a shinobi not a samurai
[2:48:40] <shadow1man9> @WoolieVersus Ichi immediately when you parry her side swipes and you can loop her into doing swipes repeatedly
[2:48:41] <Pookiedaexzile> Why is this so common with everyone who plays this game. You are a ninja, Cheat, Cheat hard, Kick her in the dick
[2:48:47] <7th_justiceflame> Your getting bodied with in 2 hits
[2:48:49] <+unfamous2423> Has he been to the gun fort?
[2:48:53] <Shir0yasha> the win button is on the controller woolie 4Head
[2:48:54] <+tigerfang86> LITERALLY blind her with flares
[2:48:55] <Shishi1205> At this point learning how to parry the grab is going to be the solution. The timing is precise but can be seen @WoolieVersus
[2:48:56] <+tigerfang86> so you can win
[2:48:57] <Djinnazz> throw sand in her face
[2:48:58] <Twin_Hallow> he can beat her now doesnt really need to come back later
[2:49:02] <%GabeSweetMan> @Pookiedaexzile But what do you kick in the absence of dick???
[2:49:09] <og_stel> its the ashina way: "JUST WIN" 4Head
[2:49:09] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[2:49:10] <+NarcissistCactus> the game tells you something along the lines of "you are not a samurai, you are a shinobi"
[2:49:10] <%masterfire23> sekiro: honor dies twice
[2:49:12] <tearknack> @unfamous2423 no, he hasn't even met kuro yet
[2:49:14] <Dragon_Batman> Despite him probably being alittle under equipped or health leveled he is doing well
[2:49:20] <Flare3500> kick her in the vag
[2:49:20] <Nina96> @GabeSweetMan the clam
[2:49:26] <+CJett92> He has the high ground!
[2:49:31] <+Reizie_Etherealm> An honorable death is valueless in the face of a dishonorable victory
[2:49:35] <+unfamous2423> @tearknack Oh then this is some interesting exploring
[2:49:35] <+Binary_Fireball> is this ng+?
[2:49:39] <Nina96> no
[2:49:41] <+Sendaar> I've noticed that there is a point where the combat just "clicks" for everyone and they start running through the rest of the game. For some like pat thats relatively early, for others its late
[2:49:45] <kikosmore> It's not a matter of being underleved. he's not even hitting her.
[2:49:46] <Dragon_Batman> not ng+
[2:49:52] <Pookiedaexzile> @GabeSweetMan Gabe, Sweet Gabe, The dick is spiritual. Not the Kick tho, thats real
[2:49:54] <haisho> she's actually not that hard once you get her down, but studying her moveset is a BITH
[2:50:05] <caol2017> She has the high ground!
[2:50:05] <Flare3500> The game clicked on me at new game plus when I decided to get the good ending
[2:50:05] <+Binary_Fireball> oooooh so this is history first time here. shit is hard
[2:50:06] <EVA_Unit02> I have the high ground, Anakin!
[2:50:06] <ocxdc> what is this cheese!? XD
[2:50:07] <tearknack> @kikosmore exactly
[2:50:08] <%GabeSweetMan> For real though, Woolz is taking on Snake Eyes waaaaaaay too early. The amount of health damage you do at this point in the game is SOOO tiny.
[2:50:14] <+decisivelynameless> @WoolieVersus There's nothing wrong with feathering the parry button sometimes. The doc you got is also fucking you up because you're thinking it's either perfect parry or just block.
[2:50:16] <Nina96> @Sendaar and some its instant and others it never happpens
[2:50:16] <%BurncoatRapscallion> he should NOT be fighting her like this
[2:50:18] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> just kill her 4Head
[2:50:24] <%juxtest> Its a lot of underlevelled
[2:50:25] <Dragon_Batman> True but he could come back with more prosthetics or even a bit more health
[2:50:26] <+NarcissistCactus> just don't get hit 4Head
[2:50:29] <ocxdc> snake eyes moves are extremely telegraphed tbh
[2:50:34] <Analogflame> just get her hp to 0
[2:50:38] <Muzzles56> bitches in chat who would give up at this point
[2:50:42] <supersugoisenpai1> Maneuvering behind an enemy usually let's you get an extra swing in before they block
[2:50:46] <+zanzibar_junker> axe is good for this
[2:50:46] <+TopTieramisu> would ichimonji be nerfed too hard if it required spirit emblems to use?
[2:50:51] <Uyko112> She's easy to defeat once you know her patterns
[2:50:53] <+cvp5127> just hit the win button Kappa
[2:50:55] <kakdela7> what's the last boss he beat? how far is he?
[2:50:57] <+duskrush> He's gotta stay in. Giving her distance and dodging instead of parrying is causing him to lose all the ground he gains in posture break and he doesn't have enough health items to keep up an endurance battle
[2:50:57] <Shir0yasha> @toptieramisu bruh
[2:50:57] <BlindGato> The Gunfu is strong
[2:50:59] <og_stel> ichi after the firecracker
[2:51:02] <%juxtest> The firecrackers also frighten Woolie
[2:51:03] <+Ecchigun> LOL
[2:51:04] <+zanzibar_junker> that's the axe
[2:51:05] <xX_BlackMage> This is my first time checking in since the breakup. Glad to see You're still going strong
[2:51:05] <+tigerfang86> FORGOT
[2:51:06] <supergoober33> @WoolieVersus You often stop hitting her before she actually deflects your attack, that's free posture damage you're leaving on the table my man.
[2:51:07] <+Hylian726> he is underpowered, but it's perfectly possible to beat this now. he'd have to learn the moveset eventually anyway
[2:51:07] <eddiemayfly> @WoolieVersus Quick heads up, jumping has I-Frames. Jumping over unblockables is just as valid as dodging them.
[2:51:08] <worldbrand> oh no
[2:51:09] <kikosmore> for the love of god dodge those gun shots brotha
[2:51:09] <Zeemod155> Use that Ichimongi when you posture is high tho
[2:51:11] <tearknack> blocking the gunshots would be fien if he was getting the timing right
[2:51:11] <+NarcissistCactus> I genuinely don't see what's so difficult about snake eyes
[2:51:11] <supersugoisenpai1> We have not rescued Kuro yet
[2:51:15] <reiju_22> maybe fight her later
[2:51:17] <+TopTieramisu> @Shir0yasha just sayin, it's so absurdly good compared to most other techniques
[2:51:18] <kikosmore> lol
[2:51:21] <haisho> @TopTieramisu Not really. You can work around having no tools.
[2:51:22] <%Lion_kun> woolie you keep making the mistake of using the crackers and backing off for no reason when you should use that moment to damage her health
[2:51:24] <Nina96> @WoolieVersus plz just poison her
[2:51:26] <worldbrand> he hasnt died from a posture break yet though, in fact it's saved him from several bullets
[2:51:36] <+hax_metatron> Crackers -> Ichimonji?
[2:51:39] <KasiCrafter> How good is the axe in this fight?
[2:51:40] <Pookiedaexzile> I wonder why when people talk female representation, nobody says anything about FirmSoft, I mean Onion Daughter thicc Af thats body postive
[2:51:40] <transporterthesequel> Also, press more button
[2:51:41] <tearknack> he can ebat her now, he just has to play more aggressive, more of a coward, or learn her petterns
[2:51:45] <%GabeSweetMan> @NarcissistCactus This game has a bunch of those where some enemies are one-shots to some people but not for others and vice-versa.
[2:51:46] <+TopTieramisu> cracker is a shinobi tool
[2:51:46] <Inebriateddonut> Just do it big and do gooder
[2:51:48] <Shir0yasha> @toptieramisu thats like huge nerf
[2:51:51] <Uyko112> I used oil and the flame prosthetic to beat her.
[2:51:56] <+Sendaar> Like it took me hours to beat the chained ogre and then when I finally got to Ashina castle I blew through Genichiro in one go
[2:52:03] <Dragon_Batman> If he got her at lower health the axe would probably help a bit more
[2:52:06] <kikosmore> @worldbrand he's missing out on damage when he blocks them and they are well telegraphed. After the kick she shoots every time
[2:52:08] <%GabeSweetMan> Like for instance I had a TON of trouble with Corrupted Monk but I thought Guardian Ape was a biiiitch.
[2:52:12] <Nyckelus> You’re doing fine Woolie. You’re still learning her moveset and when to punish.
[2:52:13] <%tank7013> @NarcissistCactus It's the damage. Snake eyes aren't thaaaat hard to fight but when you fuck up they make sure you know it
[2:52:23] <CosmosDeity> All the backseat gaming in the chat DansGame
[2:52:29] <+This_is_Marco> @GabeSweetMan wow I had the exact opposite
[2:52:33] <%GabeSweetMan> Right?
[2:52:34] <eddiemayfly> Spooky Water Lady gon do woolie a big frighten at this rate.
[2:52:37] <+TopTieramisu> all i'm saying is, i think it's a bit imbalanced compared to most other techniques
[2:52:37] <Shishi1205> She has hp and does mad dmg, that's it
[2:52:38] <%GabeSweetMan> That's how this game goes.
[2:52:39] <+hax_metatron> Stop backseating everyone!!! NotLikeThis
[2:52:44] <+TopTieramisu> ichimonji that is
[2:52:46] <kikosmore> Mihns on the couch. I can't be on the couch as well?
[2:52:47] <Shishi1205> not very forgiving
[2:52:47] <+zanzibar_junker> axe is faster
[2:52:47] <Nina96> @CosmosDeity were u expexting something else?
[2:52:51] <+Hylian726> a lot of chat is talking strategy with each other, not backseating
[2:52:57] <Shir0yasha> lol chat tryna be a pro. I beat mist noble first try punk
[2:52:59] <+starzo0> asking people not to backseat in a souls game LUL
[2:53:00] <+decisivelynameless> @eddiemayfly she's why I say feathering the parry button is perfectly valid tbh
[2:53:06] <+NarcissistCactus> any bit of advice is backseating FeelsBadMan
[2:53:06] <supergoober33> Corrupted Monk was when I really had to get through my head that dodging can be a lot better than deflecting sometimes. She has that big spinarooni and the last hits puts you in blockstun for 10 years.
[2:53:07] <Pookiedaexzile> You know the real ninjas in the chat, when they can't even tell you the whole combo, only the cheating tatic they used to kill the boss
[2:53:09] <reiju_22> isn't woolie too weak to fight her?
[2:53:11] <vVAstrAVv> so this is the stream
[2:53:16] <ocxdc> mist noble hardest boss 10/10
[2:53:16] <+Sendaar> Yeah I thought corrupted monk was easy, if you can parry the beyblade attack she basically kills herself for you
[2:53:18] <Nyckelus> @toptieramisu It’s definitely one of the best but it’d probably be better to buff other skills instead of nerfing Ichi.
[2:53:18] <Dragon_Batman> For me the brella was a super useful tool especially with the attack out of it
[2:53:21] <Pookiedaexzile> "I don't need to see the full moveset, just let me set you on fire"
[2:53:23] <+Reizie_Etherealm> The 2 hit death basis this game puts you in doesn't help either, but that's why you gotta strive for perfection
[2:53:26] <%GabeSweetMan> There exists no "right way" of beating these enemies. There's only "what works" and "what doesn't" and every single instance of what does or doesn't work is contextual.
[2:53:27] <+hax_metatron> Everyone that beat the game comes here and talks shit when they struggled as they played as well!!! Let Woolie learn on his own!!!
[2:53:34] <+TopTieramisu> @Nyckelus why not both :)
[2:53:36] <tearknack> @Pookiedaexzile female represntation is generally talked about in games where characters have prominent roles, or in genres where that representation is rare. fromsofts female characters are as fun as all their other ones, but they're pretty one note, and having female characters in fantasy games isn't new
[2:53:37] <Flare3500> Just do like Rihanna does and use that Umbrella
[2:53:38] <worldbrand> i ended up jumping out of her grabs and punishing
[2:53:38] <+diathex> I cheesed her in the poison by hiding out on the cliff.
[2:53:42] <eddiemayfly> @decisivelynameless She's why I strongly believe jumping is as valid as dodging. Fucking enemy step does her a big nasty.
[2:53:47] <Shishi1205> I mean when Snake eyes is consistent in fucking the speed runers you know she means business
[2:53:49] <Parapattern> I didn't know there were other paths so I went directly to corrupted monk as early as possible. It was a nightmare to get through.
[2:53:54] <Uyko112> Im at the Fountainhead Palce right now and that place is a bitch omg.
[2:54:06] <+This_is_Marco> @GabeSweetMan I would agree, but after watching too many speed runs there are "effective" ways to beat some bosses
[2:54:08] <+TopTieramisu> i found fountainhead palace kind of nice
[2:54:10] <haisho> if I have anything to say, it's that Woolie is learning this fight just like I did so I'm fine with the progress
[2:54:14] <+TopTieramisu> as long as you don't bumrush it
[2:54:15] <kikosmore> @Parapattern lol. Yeah I had no idea how to get to Kuro so I did everything before I even got to him.
[2:54:21] <@Moobot> Please don't fill up the entire chat, @Donchalant402
[2:54:24] <Dragon_Batman> Fountainhead was super kool
[2:54:26] <+NarcissistCactus> get shot
[2:54:29] <Shir0yasha> bruh 200 words essay
[2:54:32] <haisho> he's still gonna die a bit more before he kills her though
[2:54:34] <Zeemod155> I chi mon gi
[2:54:41] <+tigerfang86> bruh who's writing essays
[2:54:41] <Flare3500> Equip the dragon sword you get from the drake
[2:54:42] <+Sendaar> Oh there is definitely more than one way to go through each encounter in this game; I never used prosthetics on any boss but I know some people swear by them
[2:54:47] <%GabeSweetMan> @This_is_marco The "optimal strats" don't always effectively translate to casual play.
[2:54:48] <kikosmore> he almost had it. He's learning to dodge those bullets
[2:54:49] <%BurncoatRapscallion> I kinda want him to just finish up Ashina castle first
[2:54:51] <eddiemayfly> FH Palace is cool. Looks nice, is nice, big Magikarp surprise.
[2:54:52] <Dragon_Batman> I loved it because to me half of it was MGS stealth
[2:54:52] <+buttdirt> nice try though
[2:54:53] <%juxtest> After you beat her make sure you cure the dragonrot. NPC quests wont advance as long as theyre sick.
[2:54:59] <eddiemayfly> A big huggable place.
[2:54:59] <supergoober33> Woolie's also coming back to this game after almost a month, so it's not entirely comparable to people who blew through it in 3 days back to back
[2:55:08] <Quiet__Viking> I didn't do this zone untill way later
[2:55:13] <Nyckelus> @toptieramisu Mainly because Ichi is better for bosses while most other skills are better for regular enemies. Stuff in the Senpou tree are very good at interrupting attacks while Ashina are very single-target attacks.
[2:55:20] <+Ecchigun> DaRkSoUlS
[2:55:20] <Shir0yasha> foxdie spreading
[2:55:24] <+hax_metatron> Just come@back man!! She’s a mid game mini boss, you’re still early game bruh @woolieversus
[2:55:26] <%GabeSweetMan> In this game there are plenty that absolutely do! But the skill bar is something you learn by doing. Just seeing someone else do it doesn't necessarily make it any easier to pull it off.
[2:55:26] <Nina96> has anyone kept a death count?
[2:55:26] <+This_is_Marco> @GabeSweetMan yea sorry its kind of a different type of play
[2:55:37] <kikosmore> No he got this. He just has to dodge those bullets.
[2:55:40] <eddiemayfly> Dank Sauce
[2:55:42] <+Sendaar> Also people seem to by 50/50 between finding the beast bosses harder and finding the humanoid bosses harder
[2:55:45] <+Binary_Fireball> sekiro is a game that forces you to realize how wrong you are.
[2:55:46] <+NarcissistCactus> just 4Head
[2:55:48] <+Shinmaddrox> I despise the snake eyes enemies
[2:55:49] <haisho> YEYEYE WEENIE HUT JRs
[2:55:53] <Uyko112> Yeah that big Magickarp shock the fuck out of me!!
[2:55:55] <Shishi1205> Parry this gun casual
[2:55:59] <PinkSocks> This is atually so much easier with the iron umbrella
[2:55:59] <Flare3500> that stupid document they need to throw that out
[2:56:00] <+TopTieramisu> @Nyckelus sure. but you can circumvent most enemy fights with sneaking or bloodsmoke etc
[2:56:01] <worldbrand> It'd be easier to convince woolie to try somewhere else if he didn't just get down to the last 5% of this fight
[2:56:05] <%GabeSweetMan> The gunshots are probably the one attack type that are worthwhile to dodge slash.
[2:56:07] <alexandrecau> yo joe!
[2:56:08] <+Binary_Fireball> the game wants you to play it's way and then it becomes easy
[2:56:14] <+tigerfang86> this lady's gotta be good to get a sick name like SNAKE EYES
[2:56:14] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:56:19] <%GabeSweetMan> Since the i-frame window is so lenient for them.
[2:56:20] <Pookiedaexzile> @tearknack issa joke, but I like the energy. Lets a agree that Eileen the Crow is cool, and not get into argument over whats one note. Because I will not have you talking about Fireblood Mccoolblood as one note
[2:56:31] <alexandrecau> she is a gi joe
[2:56:33] <Akett> There are other areas you can try, I haven't even gotten to this one and I have eight drinks in the gourd.
[2:56:36] <Shishi1205> Crouch healing PogChamp
[2:56:36] <%GabeSweetMan> OH NOOOO
[2:56:40] <kikosmore> He's finally seeing that after the kick she shoots and you can dodge that and attack.
[2:56:45] <Flare3500> She's part of the cobra unit
[2:56:49] <Mendin> Did you know: Enemies in Sekiro with big straw jackets are... surprisingly weak to Fire?
[2:56:55] <Pookiedaexzile> Cooooooooooobra
[2:56:56] <%GabeSweetMan> Shots shots shot-shot-shot-SHOTS SHOTS
[2:57:00] <eddiemayfly> Trivia: Did y'all know you can dodge many of the Senpou monk's kicks just by crouching?
[2:57:07] <kikosmore> @Mendin oh wow. I didn't even think of that.
[2:57:12] <+Hylian726> they don't really give you many I frames in this, I find it's better to not rely on them
[2:57:14] <%GabeSweetMan> Use dem crackers boi!
[2:57:14] <vVAstrAVv> woolie i think its time to just come back later
[2:57:15] <@Moobot> Please don't fill up the entire chat, @Donchalant402
[2:57:15] <alexandrecau> nah snake eyes was with the joe as ultimate defat on cobra
[2:57:19] <+NarcissistCactus> get shot
[2:57:20] <+starzo0> @Mendin that makes sense
[2:57:20] <+tigerfang86> ESSAY OWNED AGAIN
[2:57:21] <BlindGato> Can't you deflect that grab?
[2:57:24] <Shir0yasha> SNAKE eyes ohnYell
[2:57:26] <eddiemayfly> No esse ples
[2:57:29] <Shishi1205> you can
[2:57:30] <tearknack> @Pookiedaexzile i wont lie i actua;;y forgot about bloodborne (mostly because i haven't played it myself), the characetrs in bloodborne are actually great
[2:57:30] <%juxtest> Download 75%
[2:57:34] <og_stel> shes basically a tusken raider now that I think about it LuL
[2:57:35] <Uyko112> When I fought the second Snake Eyes I was very comfortable fighting her.
[2:57:37] <Flare3500> She used to be part of militaires sans frontieres
[2:57:39] <Dragon_Batman> Yea you can delfect that grab
[2:57:39] <Mendin> It's one of those subtle mechanic things
[2:57:39] <Parapattern> Featuring the skulls parasite unit
[2:57:40] <haisho> I understand why Shirahagi is a pain in the ass to fight. Her moves are simple to get down but they do SO MUCH DAMAGE BibleThump
[2:57:41] <worldbrand> brevity is a virtue
[2:57:42] <Shishi1205> the deflect window is narrow but yu can
[2:57:43] <%GabeSweetMan> There's really no shame in coming back to this area later. That's what I did.
[2:57:43] <+ChiefWilly> Hardest boss in the game
[2:58:00] <+hax_metatron> Just come back Wools. Not worth it. You have so many other paths!!!
[2:58:00] <supersugoisenpai1> Reset
[2:58:00] <og_stel> F
[2:58:06] <+Hylian726> yeah I'd say it's one of the harder mini bosses in the game
[2:58:13] <+CJett92> mulligan
[2:58:14] <%GabeSweetMan> This boss feels like a wall only because there's SOOOO much health damage you need to do before posture damage starts to matter.
[2:58:18] <reiju_22> just go somewhere else you are clearly too weak
[2:58:20] <tearknack> woolie can do this folks
[2:58:30] <Parapattern> This game REALLY stretches the definition of "miniboss"
[2:58:32] <tearknack> he isn't tp weal
[2:58:33] <%GabeSweetMan> Oh Woolie can absolutely do this.
[2:58:33] <Nina96> let mihn do it
[2:58:36] <+hax_metatron> But why! There’s more fun areas to do
[2:58:36] <Truebluemc> if you perfect parry your posture will never be broken. Even if it is at max
[2:58:37] <+NarcissistCactus> I feel like it's normal to clear an area before going on to the next area rather than skipping around
[2:58:41] <Shir0yasha> might controls everything woolie, rest and heal up
[2:58:42] <worldbrand> why you gettin fancy on a scrub
[2:58:42] <Flare3500> @hax_metatron lol "chat just let Woolie do his thing" also @hax_metatron "LOL Woolie give up and go do another thing"
[2:58:45] <JJnAJjohnson> You can block the grab with the umbrella if you go get it
[2:58:48] <Uyko112> Im not going to lie I was stuck on Snake Eyes for 3 days.
[2:58:49] <supersugoisenpai1> You can back off and bait her gunshots, and just run around her for free swings
[2:58:51] <+Caped_Eggy> I'm sure he can do it given enough time and tries but is it worth it?
[2:58:52] <og_stel> no battle memory = miniboss
[2:58:53] <+Binary_Fireball> he will but what else are we gonna talk about?
[2:58:54] <+hax_metatron> @flare3500 Okay Mom!
[2:58:56] <+ChiefWilly> I see he is in the tilt phase, that means the recovery and peak are soon
[2:58:58] <candidateplays> I think this area is kind of designed for you to come back later, what with certain event that happen after a certain boss
[2:59:03] <Inebriateddonut> @Parapattern I did not find a single miniboss that was smaller than Sekiro
[2:59:04] <transporterthesequel> Don't dodge the gun, parry the gun
[2:59:14] <Flare3500> You can do it , you can beat The Boss
[2:59:18] <+NarcissistCactus> yeah parry the gun to do posture damage to the bullet
[2:59:33] <+TopTieramisu> @Inebriateddonut you may not like it but this is what peak shinobi performance looks like
[2:59:34] <Mendin> Hey Minh, enemies with straw/fur coats are succeptible to fire
[2:59:36] <%Lion_kun> the 3 hit combo is what is killing you lol
[2:59:37] <%GabeSweetMan> You can parry the gunshots but it does no posture damage. I found that's actually the one time it's worthwhile to dodge slash.
[2:59:41] <og_stel> its not worth it to parry the bullets
[2:59:44] <supersugoisenpai1> You can side step gunshots and do some vitality damage
[2:59:47] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> leave, lvl up and come back later maybe?
[2:59:50] <+Reizie_Etherealm> I like how when someone said don't parry the gun, someone else said parry the gun
[2:59:51] <supergoober33> This miniboss is totally doable at this point in the game, I don't think he needs to put it off till later. Small moveset, very telegraphed swings, and only a single unblockable attack.
[2:59:52] <haisho> you do so much posture damage to the bullets that the bullets die. Too bad it does nothing to Shirahagi
[2:59:56] <Nyckelus> @toptieramisu Except Bloodsmoke is one of the highest cost skills in the game and people don’t want to waste spirit emblems. Also, that won’t help learning the enemies moves when you can’t sneak.
[2:59:58] <eddiemayfly> TFW Woolie is learning Shirahagi the exact same way (((other streamer))) learned Shirahagi.
[3:00:17] <%GabeSweetMan> Chat is kinda a mixture of every conflicting form of advice.
[3:00:20] <Shir0yasha> everyone has their own tech
[3:00:22] <Zeemod155> HP damage is what you should use to measure progress with... *not* posture damage
[3:00:22] <+InstiGaitan> dodging perilous too early
[3:00:27] <%GabeSweetMan> Because not everyone learns the same way.
[3:00:30] <+Binary_Fireball> Dodge the parry
[3:00:33] <Dragon_Batman> It's not as punishing as you would think
[3:00:37] <eddiemayfly> @GabeSweetMan And always sometimes shitposts.
[3:00:38] <Flare3500> Omnislash her
[3:00:43] <%GabeSweetMan> AAAAWW dang it post!
[3:00:48] <Inebriateddonut> @GabeSweetMan how do I upvote this chat message?

[3:01:06] <worldbrand> oof
[3:01:08] <Parapattern> Kill her with the infinity gauntlet
[3:01:09] <%GabeSweetMan> Oof. Still you got 1/3 health down.
[3:01:12] <+TopTieramisu> @Nyckelus all i'm saying is techniques that help against enemies are far less valuable than ones that help against bosses in a game that gives you so many options besides fighting regular enemies face to face
[3:01:14] <eddiemayfly> 2 Post 2 Furious
[3:01:14] <ne_zha> Just win 4Head
[3:01:15] <%GabeSweetMan> Nice doge slash.
[3:01:17] <haisho> to be fair, I just sprint out of grab range rather than dodge
[3:01:24] <+NarcissistCactus> is easy mode selectable yet
[3:01:27] <kikosmore> He's getting there. He's dodge slashing those bullets
[3:01:27] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> combo'd
[3:01:31] <worldbrand> If you're going to throw out those firecrackers, believe in them
[3:01:34] <+TopTieramisu> also, you get spirit emblems all the times from regular enemies
[3:01:35] <%GabeSweetMan> FUCK OFF
[3:01:36] <+bbHighvalor> lol
[3:01:36] <+starzo0> LUL
[3:01:37] <supergoober33> She cheesed you

[3:01:40] <Mendin> SCOOPED
[3:01:40] <MarylandJutsu> Ancient Technique: GUN
[3:01:41] <Nina96> best run so far though
[3:01:41] <Uyko112> Yeah side step the unblockable shot. You will know when see her igniting the gun.
[3:01:41] <+NarcissistCactus> yoink
[3:01:42] <Dragon_Batman> He might need to take a quick brake from this area just to cool off a bit
[3:01:43] <%GabeSweetMan> That hitbox is NONSENSE and always has been.
[3:01:45] <Professor_Rakor> Daaang
[3:01:46] <Jackomaning> That's a From Soft hitbox right there
[3:01:47] <Flare3500> just 20 more deaths and easy mode will be automatically installed
[3:01:48] <+duskrush> She had the high ground
[3:01:50] <Shir0yasha> anti-cheese
[3:01:50] <eddiemayfly> Oooh Sekiro's Shitboxes
[3:01:51] <vVAstrAVv> come back laaaaterrr
[3:01:51] <ocxdc> i try to deflect anything that isn't proceeded by the warning kanji, it seems to work over dodging imo
[3:01:53] <%juxtest> The Pellets!
[3:01:54] <JJnAJjohnson> Holy fuck
[3:01:54] <eddiemayfly> How fun how fun
[3:01:58] <%GabeSweetMan> The ultimate technique HITBOX
[3:01:58] <og_stel> technically this is easy mode given the bell exists LuL
[3:01:59] <%serranobros> woolie use your jump button, dodges are just going to get you killed
[3:02:01] <+Sendaar> Can you jump the grab? I don't actually know
[3:02:04] <+kiiiirsten> sbfpYeyeye
[3:02:08] <%GabeSweetMan> Yes you can jump the grab.
[3:02:09] <Djinnazz> yes
[3:02:11] <+hax_metatron> People acting like hitboxes in this game suck??? LULW
[3:02:19] <Shishi1205> At this point learning how to parry the grab is going to be the solution. The timing is precise but can be seen @WoolieVersus
[3:02:23] <vVAstrAVv> you can get like 5 more goards and come back
[3:02:30] <Flare3500> I've been caught in the air while jumping so I don't really know
[3:02:31] <Shir0yasha> bell and no kuro charm NotLikeThis
[3:02:34] <+InstiGaitan> If you jump over her you can jump the grab, but it isn't a sweep
[3:02:34] <+TopTieramisu> hitboxes don't matter when you can deflect :)
[3:02:36] <+NarcissistCactus> fight the last miniboss and tell me hitboxes in this game aren't wonky
[3:02:37] <supersugoisenpai1> @Sendaar She can grab you out of the air
[3:02:40] <haisho> to be fair most of the jank hitboxes are grabs so you kinda expect them really
[3:02:41] <+hax_metatron> It’s like maybe 3 attacks around the game with questionable hitboxes, in a game that has stellar combat all around
[3:02:48] <VritraReiRei> anyone know what try Woolie is on?
[3:02:50] <%invisi_bliss> You GOT this
[3:02:56] <%GabeSweetMan> @Shishi1205 The parry window often isn't worth the risk. Even I still don't bother to parry it.
[3:02:57] <Truebluemc> i personally found a back dodge then front dodge slash was the best way to punish the grab
[3:02:57] <Flare3500> Cover your Fear , Protect Your Rear
[3:02:57] <Uyko112> Dont get me started with the demon bell on this boss.
[3:03:00] <Parapattern> Woolie makin the Zoidberg "whoop whoop whoop" while running away
[3:03:01] <supergoober33> Eh the only hitbox I found questionable was the ogre's grabs, nothing else
[3:03:02] <ocxdc> im gonna guess around 10 or 15
[3:03:04] <+Solutha> Wow, still fighting snake eyes
[3:03:05] <tearknack> @ocxdc which is the right thing to do, but parrying>dodging>blocking
[3:03:14] <+PenmanLupine> maybe he should try a different ninja tool. the firecrackers are only really good for beasts
[3:03:14] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:03:15] <tearknack> imo
[3:03:16] <+This_is_Marco> why is this crazy woman in this poison pit anway
[3:03:18] <+TopTieramisu> jumping is a way better option vs ogre's grab
[3:03:18] <the_hidden_yeti> Does he know guarding will make his posture meter go down faster?
[3:03:22] <+InstiGaitan> Dang gabe doesnt even do it that means it isnt worth
[3:03:24] <Shishi1205> I mean if he can get it consistently he will get high posture dmg
[3:03:25] <%Lion_kun> only use the crackers on the danger symbol
[3:03:29] <tearknack> @the_hidden_yeti yes
[3:03:30] <haisho> @Solutha She's one of the few notorious walls in the game
[3:03:33] <+TopTieramisu> dodging the ogre's grab is waaay less reliable
[3:03:38] <%GabeSweetMan> @WoolieVersus How are you enjoying BlightCon 5.0?
[3:03:38] <ocxdc> @tearknack agreed
[3:03:46] <VritraReiRei> @the_hidden_yeti he found out near the start of the stream
[3:03:48] <Mendin> nice dodge dere :B
[3:03:52] <kikosmore> There we go
[3:03:54] <Shir0yasha> woolie live by the document
[3:03:54] <worldbrand> good good
[3:03:55] <Uyko112> @True Backdodge is the way tho get out the grap
[3:03:59] <transporterthesequel> Wait isn't her kick a thrust?
[3:04:00] <%serranobros> start learning the parry time my dude, blocking is only going to get you so far, she's going to guard break you every time
[3:04:01] <eddiemayfly> @supergoober33 Hitboxes on slopes can and will do you a nasty. Thankfully, there aren't that many fights in slopes in this game.
[3:04:03] <%juxtest> Look at him go
[3:04:03] <Professor_Rakor> Yer doing it, peter!
[3:04:03] <OkamiDude15> ???
[3:04:04] <%GabeSweetMan> Good health damage so far.
[3:04:05] <haisho> DOING IT

[3:04:47] <+TopTieramisu> he knows
[3:04:47] <+Sendaar> I've found that most enemies in the game can actually stop you from attack spamming unless they hit a deflect of their own or start a slow obvious unblockable attack
[3:04:48] <+Reizie_Etherealm> CAN YA FEEL IT MR KRABS
[3:04:50] <Mendin> Vitality affects both rate of posture damage and minimum posture damage after healing

[3:05:28] <%Lion_kun> broke your rhythm

[3:05:32] <og_stel> NotLikeThis

[3:05:35] <%KaizenChaos> woolieSCARED
[3:05:35] <%Lion_kun> should have sued a cracker for safety
[3:05:37] <ocxdc> ignore the meters and just watch their movements
[3:05:37] <+TopTieramisu> woolie's solved the riddle
[3:05:37] <Videogamer4> honestly getting your posture broken on purpose and rolling away is better then trying to block to regain
[3:05:38] <rasterman> it was the right move, just didn't work out
[3:05:38] <%robobeau> @WoolieVersus That grab is the perfect to dash back then go in for a charged attack
[3:05:44] <%GabeSweetMan> @WoolieVersus Remember the Basics of CQC! CRACKERS QUICK CRACKERS!

[3:05:57] <Nina96> u started punishing the gun shots which is good
[3:05:58] <vVAstrAVv> the tilt
[3:06:01] <Flare3500> I jinxed it on purpose so that we can be here forever
[3:06:05] <Mendin> @WoolieVersus When an enemy is at 25% health, their posture never heals anymore. If it's a little higher, it wont heal below 50ish% posture
[3:06:05] <+InstiGaitan> Has anyone seen distortion kill snake eyes?
[3:06:06] <lewdskeletor13> Howdy yall I’m back
[3:06:09] <+InstiGaitan> Shits ridiculous
[3:06:12] <%GabeSweetMan> Punishing gunshots is the safest method of health damage.
[3:06:13] <OkamiDude15> get him stuck in your rhythm woolie
[3:06:15] <+Nova893> Their posture recovers super slow when their vitality is halved and 25%
[3:06:16] <og_stel> caught her in your rhythm
[3:06:17] <Shir0yasha> ohnKoji u like this game?
[3:06:22] <ocxdc> speedrunning is pure degeneracy lol
[3:06:26] <+TopTieramisu> @OkamiDude15 her
[3:06:30] <supergoober33> This will prepare him for the toughest miniboss of all, mist noble.
[3:06:31] <VritraReiRei> can anyone remember woolie having this much trouble with any Souls Bosses? I think he had some trouble with a DLC boss from DS2 but I cant remember

[3:06:58] <%juxtest> This room is the Dark Souls of boss arenas

[3:07:12] <worldbrand> nice nice
[3:07:12] <ocxdc> mist noble wrecks my day
[3:07:17] <+TopTieramisu> i want there to be an npc version of one these gun women in the dlc
[3:07:24] <+TopTieramisu> they're so cool
[3:07:30] <ocxdc> @TopTieramisu good idea
[3:07:35] <Mendin> The lore does mention that they're an offshoot clan from the Okami
[3:07:37] <+NarcissistCactus> nice hitbox
[3:07:38] <+InstiGaitan> @Flare3500 oh dang fr? I haven't watched since he got sub 26 I think it was
[3:07:42] <Uyko112> I never played Souls or Bourne games. This was my first From Software game.
[3:07:50] <%laserbeaming> woolieLORE
[3:07:50] <+Reizie_Etherealm> I can't wait to see Woolie become a timing god by the end of this game
[3:07:51] <+InstiGaitan> When he found the skip where he jumps up the tree
[3:07:53] <%GabeSweetMan> Yeah I've done the same lol. Ichimonji just comes out sometimes.
[3:07:53] <Shir0yasha> any bet woolie die on mist noble? Kappa
[3:07:54] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> greed
[3:07:58] <%robobeau> Backdash > Charge attack
[3:08:03] <ocxdc> shhhhhhh
[3:08:03] <+Nomicro4u> Hey its billy
[3:08:07] <ocxdc> mist noble is OP
[3:08:07] <%GabeSweetMan> @Shir0yasha That WOULD be embarrasing.
[3:08:09] <Flare3500> @InstiGaitan The new Sub 25 mins video lets him skip from ashina castle directly to the ape
[3:08:09] <lewdskeletor13> Gun is too strong
[3:08:13] <vVAstrAVv> if ichimonjis fing you take it off
[3:08:18] <%juxtest> That grab just sucks
[3:08:21] <%serranobros> woolie, jump back, it's safer
[3:08:21] <+InstiGaitan> Dude there is no doubt that woolie will die to mist noble
[3:08:27] <eddiemayfly> @WoolieVersus Quick reminder: Jumping has I-frames. It is as valuable as dodging and, if you can jump into an enemy step, you can do some big nasties to an enemy's posture.
[3:08:27] <b1gboss007> Just go somewhere else and come back later
[3:08:31] <Shir0yasha> @gabesweetman thats almost impossible ohnLUL
[3:08:36] <Dragon_Batman> It's easy to accidentally get a skill out, I do it all the time
[3:08:37] <vVAstrAVv> heck i almost never have a ability on cus of that
[3:08:37] <+starzo0> this is woolies hyperbolic time chamber
[3:08:46] <ocxdc> truu
[3:08:47] <+InstiGaitan> If woolie doesn't die to mist noble he's a god
[3:08:48] <supergoober33> Mist Noble is like OPM King, Woolie will overestimate and destroy himself
[3:08:48] <Uyko112> Mist Noble... LOL
[3:08:52] <+Milpool> use those crackers
[3:08:58] <+TopTieramisu> i think they should remove one of the health bars for mist noble. it's a serious wall for players
[3:09:00] <+NarcissistCactus> mist noble was my wall tbh
[3:09:03] <og_stel> how many times do you guys think itll take woolie to beat mist noble?
[3:09:08] <ocxdc> yeah nerf mist noble
[3:09:09] <OkamiDude15> mist noble OMEGALAUGHING
[3:09:14] <Nina96> @Milpool he cant time it right
[3:09:15] <%GabeSweetMan> I'll admit, the point at which I quit on this area was when I "almost" won as well. It tilted me so hard.
[3:09:16] <Shir0yasha> probably more than this
[3:09:20] <+InstiGaitan> honestly I quit at mist noble it was too hard
[3:09:22] <Nyckelus> @toptieramisu The Senpou tree is good against bosses that don’t have super-armor, Nightjar is great for making or closing distance, and Ichi is specifically for posture. If I can already deal tons of posture damage then why would I need Ichi? Not to mention Ichi only really works on bosses with big openings.
[3:09:31] <Dragon_Batman> All it takes is one good tilt
[3:09:38] <ocxdc> i also remember leabing this area and coming back later
[3:09:41] <%GabeSweetMan> @InstiGaitan lol
[3:09:43] <+This_is_Marco> @WoolieVersus I spent an embarrassingly long time on the Gyobu fight
[3:09:50] <%robobeau> No she's not
[3:09:53] <%GabeSweetMan> crazy talk!
[3:09:53] <Flare3500> I love the prosthetic where you can throw gold it's pretty cool
[3:09:54] <OkamiDude15> so has woolie done senpou yet?
[3:10:01] <Dragon_Batman> I went to the gun fort before this one
[3:10:03] <%GabeSweetMan> No Senpou Temple yet.
[3:10:04] <ocxdc> Gyoubu is a boss?
[3:10:04] <supergoober33> @InstiGaitan More time to write articles for Polygon, so there's an upside
[3:10:05] <%robobeau> She can't be poisoned here
[3:10:06] <Kghaleon> Mist noble: Don't be seen.
[3:10:06] <%UrsulaCat> poison running through my veins
[3:10:06] <OkamiDude15> kk
[3:10:07] <jay521> is this NG+?
[3:10:11] <BestTeaMaker> is woolie still fighting this woman?
[3:10:12] <ocxdc> i barely noticed
[3:10:13] <shadow1man9> No
[3:10:14] <%UrsulaCat> I don't wanna break these chains
[3:10:17] <%GabeSweetMan> This is the path to Mibu Village iirc.
[3:10:17] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[3:10:18] <BabyNaBackbrace> Oil bottles and Flame Vent does wonders on just about everything in this game
[3:10:22] <Dragon_Batman> not ng+
[3:10:23] <supersugoisenpai1> I went Senpou, then gun fort, then here
[3:10:25] <%juxtest> No he came straight here from Castle
[3:10:34] <Nina96> y do people think this is ng+?
[3:10:34] <%GabeSweetMan> Okay stay careful.
[3:10:34] <+InstiGaitan> Yeah mist noble is next boss if he continues
[3:10:35] <%GabeSweetMan> HEAL
[3:10:39] <%GabeSweetMan> Good goo
[3:10:43] <%robobeau> I HAVE THE HIGH GROUND
[3:10:44] <s_snowball> i cheesed this on one of my playthroughs by having her get stuck in the poison and slowly letting it drain her health
[3:10:45] <+Taglog7> I have the high ground
[3:10:47] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> JUMP
[3:10:48] <Flare3500> Has Woolie finished ashina castle ?
[3:10:51] <Shishi1205> Don't get got the game
[3:10:53] <%GabeSweetMan> No he hasn't.
[3:10:58] <Nina96> @Flare3500 no
[3:10:59] <CosmosDeity> Come on wollie!
[3:10:59] <+This_is_Marco> tbh it makes the other areas of the game fairly easy
[3:11:01] <supersugoisenpai1> Castle isn't even done yet, Woolie has made this harder than it has to be
[3:11:08] <Dragon_Batman> Funny senpou temple was one of the last major areas I went to
[3:11:09] <Uyko112> You going to get killed doing that Woolie
[3:11:17] <+starzo0> wait she has the high ground
[3:11:21] <%GabeSweetMan> Almost 50% health
[3:11:22] <BabyNaBackbrace> I'm stuck at O Ren of the Water, great fight
[3:11:28] <shotgang86> we still here huh
[3:11:29] <%GabeSweetMan> 50% here we go

[3:11:43] <Dragon_Batman> Woolie has not finished the castle yes
[3:11:44] <OkamiDude15> if that scooped him sfhLUL
[3:11:44] <Videogamer4> monkas
[3:11:45] <Shir0yasha> there's no way he can beat mist noble without finishing ashina castle
[3:12:01] <Shishi1205> Come on woolie download complete
[3:12:03] <og_stel> mist noble will have his way with woolie
[3:12:07] <%GabeSweetMan> Look beating Princess Mononoke Reference is more important than saving the Shota.

[3:13:27] <Parapattern> They do stack
[3:13:30] <Nyckelus> Good job, Woolie! Nicely done.
[3:13:30] <the_hidden_yeti> it looked like they stack
[3:13:31] <+applefibs> trust chat
[3:13:31] <eddiemayfly> Duration stacks, healrate doesn't.
[3:13:33] <Zeemod155> Looked like they stacked to me
[3:13:34] <jay521> they maybe stack
[3:13:35] <+wardenofwinter> They stack
[3:13:36] <%laserbeaming> Do they stack?
[3:13:36] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> THEY DO STACK
[3:13:36] <Dragon_Batman> or at least it didn't feel like it
[3:13:36] <@akuda_bar> Yeah well you don't feel any accomplishment from beating a hard boss anyway so it doesn't matter~
[3:13:38] <+PenmanLupine> They do stack, they don't stack, never change chat
[3:13:39] <tearknack> @SoushinSen duration stacks
[3:13:39] <+InstiGaitan> I'm like 90% sure it just goes faster
[3:13:41] <Shishi1205> Lmao evryone doubting

[3:13:42] <Muzzles56> theres a 30% chance they stack
[3:13:43] <+This_is_Marco> LUL no one knows
[3:13:43] <+Aztec50> nice
[3:13:49] <BabyNaBackbrace> One of the best things you can do for this game is just come back later, maybe the next day.
[3:13:49] <Uyko112> They do stack lol
[3:13:50] <%Zombino924> please go to the castle
[3:13:51] <%BurncoatRapscallion> I found that just double tapping Parry works wonders
[3:13:52] <%GabeSweetMan> IT IS A MYSTERY
[3:13:52] <Flare3500> they stack like boobs
[3:13:54] <+TopTieramisu> they don't stack the way they do in ds2
[3:13:56] <+Speedwagon_13> They do stack
[3:13:57] <haisho> I had to go away for a bit. I missed Woolie doing it. I'm sad now.
[3:13:58] <+hax_metatron> Do the castle now
[3:14:00] <OkamiDude15> 30% of the time they stack 60% of the time
[3:14:05] <$Mighty_observer> mmmmm big lies
[3:14:06] <Flare3500> Pfffft Document is trash
[3:14:06] <supergoober33> Actually until you look it up they both stack and do not stack, in a super-position
[3:14:09] <eddiemayfly> @WoolieVersus Pellets duration stacks, Pellet's heal rate doesn't stack.
[3:14:16] <KiraKamixephos> They have to stack, it would be dumb if they didn’t
[3:14:17] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Good way of putting it Billy
[3:14:18] <Shir0yasha> they stack based on rng
[3:14:27] <Kghaleon> lol, blood plasters that don't need to be there yet.
[3:14:30] <ocxdc> lululululuuckkyyyy
[3:14:32] <PinkSocks> Has Billy beaten the game?
[3:14:33] <Videogamer4> PogChamp
[3:14:34] <%GabeSweetMan> They stack based upon the position of the moon and time of month.
[3:14:35] <th3madness> one hour later, woolie progresses
[3:14:35] <Shishi1205> They stack like temporary things stack
[3:14:37] <OkamiDude15> they stack if you have the right synergy
[3:14:37] <%juxtest> @WoolieVersus Cure Dragonrot, a quest is stalled
[3:14:39] <$Mighty_observer> Mihn is the new woolie lies
[3:14:40] <Zeemod155> Billy has unburdened knowledge

[3:14:47] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:14:48] <Shishi1205> Go there
[3:14:48] <womp_wee> @WoolieVersus I don't know if anyone's told you yet or you already found out, but holding block recovers posture faster (depending on your health). Try holding block more in some situations instead of putting your sword down.
[3:14:49] <+Reizie_Etherealm> You really don't
[3:14:49] <alexandrecau> ming no arm ran it
[3:14:49] <supergoober33> I feel like seeing Billy's playthrough would infuriate me to no end.
[3:14:50] <Parapattern> It's fine right now

[3:17:44] <tearknack> @WoolieVersus nothing in here
[3:17:44] <Shishi1205> nothing
[3:17:46] <vVAstrAVv> "the exit is up there" :starts going right: lol

[3:18:01] <Flare3500> top tier document knowledge
[3:18:01] <+buttdirt> feels like maybe they originally wanted to put a boss here but decided against it
[3:18:02] <Videogamer4> chat don't spoil
[3:18:10] <Uyko112> Word off advise: Dont fight the Headless yet.
[3:18:12] <OkamiDude15> there is nothing in here woolie
[3:18:12] <th3madness> there's nothing here
[3:18:12] <jay521> his video game OCD is triggered
[3:18:13] <ocxdc> lol "decided againt it"
[3:18:19] <Uyko112> of*
[3:18:20] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[3:18:20] <Professor_Rakor> Let the man wug hall.
[3:18:20] <ArthurDoyleRPG> Just let him explore Billy SwiftRage SwiftRage SwiftRage
[3:18:23] <energywarning> just a big ol' room
[3:18:24] <+Keyd00d> VOD can anyone tell me why woolie isn't being allowed to explore on his own?
[3:18:27] <BabyNaBackbrace> Hah, my first thought too, "this is a boss fight room"
[3:18:28] <+Bigmeanjean> but there is tho lol
[3:18:29] <+TopTieramisu> there is no war in ba sing se
[3:18:31] <VritraReiRei> no bus?
[3:18:31] <og_stel> "decided against it" LuL
[3:18:32] <haisho> dont worry about the beads
[3:18:32] <Nyckelus> I’m surprised that Woolie is exploring this area so early. You usually get here later.
[3:18:36] <Parapattern> Hey now, don't you even worry about it
[3:18:37] <%GabeSweetMan> Where do you wanna use them Woolie?
[3:18:41] <+InstiGaitan> [Streamer] was also astounded that there was nothing in there
[3:18:45] <OkamiDude15> shove the beads up your ass to increase vitality
[3:18:46] <eddiemayfly> The Foglands
[3:18:47] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Oh
[3:18:50] <+Reizie_Etherealm> It's the valley!
[3:18:51] <Flare3500> Use them anal beads fitty
[3:18:52] <Donchalant402> @WoolieVersus Just a general tip you can use Dragon's Blood Droplet to regain the use of your resurrection meter after you can no longer use it(the game never tells you this, only that it regains a little meter).
[3:18:54] <%laserbeaming> Zone, if you are listening, save this audio clips
[3:18:55] <Uyko112> Phantom time
[3:18:57] <th3madness> hmm I 'm guessing there's a progress lock soon
[3:19:07] <supergoober33> Did most people really get here a lot later? I wandered almost straight here after Ashina Castle.
[3:19:10] <+TopTieramisu> the next boss is near impossible
[3:19:15] <Shishi1205> Pat had the same reaction
[3:19:16] <Dragon_Batman> Cough cough, castle cough cough
[3:19:24] <th3madness> this was the last place I went
[3:19:24] <+NarcissistCactus> he hasn't cleared ashina castle though
[3:19:24] <og_stel> mist noble inc monkaS
[3:19:24] <Donchalant402> Bundled Jizo Statues do the same too
[3:19:27] <+InstiGaitan> This where the stream ends
[3:19:34] <Videogamer4> oh yeah woolie will like not beat the next boss
[3:19:37] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> except when its not
[3:19:37] <%GabeSweetMan> Wait where was Jinzaemon???
[3:19:39] <Zeemod155> There's an unnecessary amount of bonfires in this game
[3:19:40] <tearknack> i'm hoping he tries to clear ashina castle
[3:19:41] <Videogamer4> well right now

[3:21:30] <+Milpool> remember iron code
[3:21:31] <+NarcissistCactus> finna speedrun to the final boss
[3:21:31] <Taliesin_> It's a FROM game, there's good shit in every direction.
[3:21:33] <Shir0yasha> mist noble avoided. monkaW
[3:21:33] <supergoober33> Better to leave Mist Noble till endgame, I don't think you're ready
[3:21:43] <Mendin> It's like four gunmen, they die fast
[3:21:44] <Dragon_Batman> Stair case
[3:21:46] <ocxdc> never fight mist noble its not worth it
[3:21:47] <Graxe_> Oh, the screaming hype man
[3:21:47] <%GabeSweetMan> @laserbeaming Agreed but Castle is """intended""" first route.
[3:21:49] <JJnAJjohnson> Yay! Next boss will be fun for the Woolz
[3:21:49] <Professor_Rakor> All the gun boys die pretty fast.
[3:21:49] <DeathByPoke7> castle is just full of losers and whimps
[3:21:51] <Flare3500> I followed the Iron Code until the end on my first playthrough
[3:21:53] <ocxdc> its too grindy imo
[3:21:54] <supersugoisenpai1> You don't have to fight him now
[3:21:56] <reiju_22> lol no
[3:21:57] <+hax_metatron> Geez this guy is not directing Woolie properly, sorry. Come on man, don’t lead Woolie into areas where he’ll be stuck for an hour. Let him play the game normally
[3:21:58] <Graxe_> Hyping up his troops
[3:21:59] <og_stel> just use the spear to kill the guys
[3:21:59] <NerevaRising> Wut?
[3:22:03] <BabyNaBackbrace> Will I get to see the first reaction to Woo Guy?
[3:22:06] <vVAstrAVv> just shuriken. theres no real setup.
[3:22:06] <Zombrocom> Nah just run up to the gun dudes and kill them one by one, it's really easy
[3:22:07] <Psyramics> save him until later
[3:22:07] <Mendin> He doesn't have a spear
[3:22:11] <+This_is_Marco> Spear guy on par with final boss
[3:22:14] <PinkSocks> It really doesn't, just jump in, get a deathblow on the miniboss, then cut through the smaller guys.
[3:22:14] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> theres a side are to lead him too away from the mobs
[3:22:15] <%GabeSweetMan> You missed WOOOOO reaction unfortunately
[3:22:19] <the_hidden_yeti> hold it and it does it all around you
[3:22:20] <%laserbeaming> @GabeSweetMan yeah, but going to unintended places and getting lost is part of the experience
[3:22:23] <Dragon_Batman> Does he have the key is the question
[3:22:29] <%juxtest> Firecrackests

[3:22:51] <Shishi1205> He does need the gun fort key
[3:22:54] <ocxdc> Kamikaze's are legend
[3:22:55] <Nina96> u just spent like 1 hr on 3 enemy's we can live through 10min @WoolieVersus
[3:22:56] <eddiemayfly> TFW "Don't Backseat, chat" but streamer comes with incorporated backseater.

[3:23:30] <Uyko112> Yeah he do need that key
[3:23:32] <JJnAJjohnson> Wait for kunai
[3:23:33] <Professor_Rakor> The kunai is a fairly higher lvl upgrade.
[3:23:33] <supergoober33> @eddiemayfly Billy's less of a backseater and more a little devil on Woolie's shoulder telling him to cheese fights and challenge
[3:23:34] <BabyNaBackbrace> is it backseating if you DM Billy?
[3:23:40] <+WordsHere> Yes
[3:23:41] <+NarcissistCactus> billy has a phd in backseating
[3:23:48] <+WordsHere> You can see the requirements now
[3:23:49] <eddiemayfly> @laserbeaming Oh shit, nevermind me then.
[3:23:51] <Djinnazz> Triangle
[3:23:59] <JJnAJjohnson> You need to unlock previous versions before you can use it, don’t get kunai
[3:23:59] <+InstiGaitan> backseating the guy in the back seat
[3:23:59] <Nina96> @NarcissistCactus and sandbaging

[3:24:24] <+WordsHere> Nope
[3:24:30] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Billy is already backseating so just backseat billy so the backseating can become more beneficial lol
[3:24:31] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> you dont need it to see you just need tier 2 upgrades
[3:24:31] <Nina96> @haisho marvel
[3:24:34] <og_stel> no you just need the upgrade before it
[3:24:41] <Mendin> Did Woolie save the merchant who moves to the temple?
[3:24:43] <%ChoculaUltra> Sculptor lived a hard life.
[3:24:49] <tearknack> @SoushinSen he hasn''t bought enough upgrades to see that ier yet

[3:28:42] <NinjaTB> is this NG+ run?
[3:28:45] <+Binary_Fireball> almost shat
[3:28:45] <ocxdc> no
[3:28:46] <Parapattern> This guy is cake compared to snake eyes
[3:28:49] <supergoober33> @NinjaTB No
[3:28:50] <Djinnazz> they all take one hit
[3:28:50] <jay521> You can just kill them all with shuriken from the bottom of the stairs
[3:28:56] <og_stel> ???
[3:28:57] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> why?
[3:28:59] <Zombrocom> Just hit them, they hit in like 2 hits, and the deathblows prevent them from attacking you
[3:29:00] <supergoober33> ???
[3:29:00] <Dragon_Batman> Hell you can probably deathblow the boss then just casually kill em all
[3:29:00] <PinkSocks> Botched
[3:29:01] <Inebriateddonut> LUL woops
[3:29:01] <Nina96> ???
[3:29:01] <+bbHighvalor> perfect
[3:29:02] <ocxdc> "like mario"
[3:29:05] <haisho> if you're ballsy enough you can deathblow the boss then murder everything before the boss touches you
[3:29:07] <Flare3500> like a true shinobi , that document sure is perfect
[3:29:07] <ocxdc> its just like mario!
[3:29:08] <Shir0yasha> ashina talks a lot of shit for someone in ichimoni range
[3:29:13] <reiju_22> just deathblow the miniboss, the others die pretty quick
[3:29:18] <NinjaTB> i thought woolie beat sekiro though...
[3:29:24] <th3madness> I'm not going to lie, I'm not big on Minh driving woolie
[3:29:25] <Professor_Rakor> Even without stealth, the gun guys die in like, 2 hits.
[3:29:26] <ocxdc> "The Mario Bros of Dark Souls"
[3:29:26] <%laserbeaming> Well, you can Goomba Stomp enemies in this game.
[3:29:30] <KiraKamixephos> Jump towards them don’t fall on them
[3:29:33] <Mythundare> You gotta jump forward and the game will line up with the target
[3:29:38] <OkamiDude15> these guys are all gunmen so shouldnt they just die in like 2-3 hits even on block?
[3:29:39] <Nyckelus> @ninjatb He didn’t though.
[3:29:40] <+Binary_Fireball> hey batter batter
[3:29:44] <Flare3500> Woolie beat the sekiro document
[3:29:44] <+Binary_Fireball> SWING
[3:30:04] <NinjaTB> okay, good to know, i'll be careful not to spoil anything
[3:30:05] <supergoober33> LOL
[3:30:06] <+TopTieramisu> ballsy
[3:30:06] <supersugoisenpai1> Why
[3:30:08] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> why? \
[3:30:10] <Zombrocom> Yeah, it's way better to just hit them and fight them, they die super easy and the deathblow animations prevent anybody from hitting you
[3:30:10] <ocxdc> hurry up and save the princess from the giant reptile boss
[3:30:14] <+Reizie_Etherealm> This is fine
[3:30:15] <+duskrush> Just deathblow the boss
[3:30:16] <Flare3500> Nice perfect document
[3:30:18] <og_stel> why wouldnt you deathblow the miniboss?
[3:30:20] <reiju_22> just kill the guys with the rifles
[3:30:20] <@Menitta> Oh that looks hard
[3:30:22] <%ChoculaUltra> Woolie livin on the fuckin' edge.
[3:30:27] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[3:30:27] <jay521> hes trying to kill the soldiers first to fight the boss 1v1
[3:30:34] <Mythundare> back to full health :(
[3:30:38] <+TopTieramisu> he's back to full health LUL
[3:30:46] <OkamiDude15> i feel like woolie is being too cautious of these enemies who die extremely fast
[3:30:49] <reiju_22> the soldiers are weak as fuck, no need to deathblow NotLikeThis
[3:30:51] <+duskrush> but the soldiers only take a couple hits to posture break
[3:30:58] <jay521> Yeah, he can wipe them all out then retreat to reset the boss
[3:30:58] <dapperdoop> gotta shuriken
[3:31:02] <+TopTieramisu> you can deathblow the boss. just kill the shooters first
[3:31:04] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> hahaha
[3:31:05] <Flare3500> the document said play like a pussy
[3:31:06] <og_stel> the soldiers take 2 hits
[3:31:07] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> gunmen are easy to kill
[3:31:09] <Shishi1205> He didn't deathblow the miniboss guys
[3:31:11] <Truebluemc> rifle dudes are super weak. like 2 hits will kill them
[3:31:14] <%GabeSweetMan> Just kill the gunmen and run away.
[3:31:15] <shotgang86> shuriken is way more effective
[3:31:17] <ocxdc> its hard to remeber to always use the prosthetic, imo. The combat is so fluid and satisfying you barely need em
[3:31:18] <shotgang86> and time saving
[3:31:26] <vVAstrAVv> please just db the boss
[3:31:26] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[3:31:28] <+Randrews545> The gun guys die in like .2 seconds why is he so spooked by them
[3:31:31] <OkamiDude15> wait yeah 2 charged shuriken would actually just kill them
[3:31:35] <+duskrush> There's nothing wrong with being cautious, but you can't avoid fighting forever. Maybe you should upgrade your combat skills
[3:31:36] <Zeemod155> you can combo deathblows as long as you start with the right gunman
[3:31:37] <supergoober33> just hit them
[3:31:38] <jay521> just kill the guys
[3:31:38] <+TopTieramisu> i guess woolie hates shuriken
[3:31:39] <%GabeSweetMan> LOL dude they take like 2 hits
[3:31:40] <womp_wee> I agree with the shuriken strat, kills all the enemies quick and you can deathblow the miniboss from the roof
[3:31:44] <Shir0yasha> the document said deathblow the dudes
[3:31:47] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Run and sneak tactic LUL
[3:31:50] <reiju_22> @WoolieVersus woolie the rifle guys die pretty quickly, no need to deathblow
[3:31:52] <Nyckelus> @ocxdc Yeah. It’s mostly the cost of using them that turns me away from ever practicing with hem.
[3:31:55] <Foodfordagods> using dance against purple ninjas is nice
[3:31:56] <KingOfTheGeats> they don't have that much hp
[3:31:58] <th3madness> this would have been so much easier if he just went to antechamber
[3:31:59] <supergoober33> The PDF has led Woolie astray
[3:32:00] <PinkSocks> This is pretty unecessary, they go down really easily in a direct fight.
[3:32:04] <+frunkAF> oh wow
[3:32:06] <Flare3500> woolie is playing by the document guys let him do his document
[3:32:12] <%GabeSweetMan> Gunners have almost no health or posture.
[3:32:16] <OkamiDude15> their posture is actually garbage
[3:32:21] <+hax_metatron> Yeah you can kill gunners in two hits
[3:32:21] <Zombrocom> This is NOT intended
[3:32:22] <th3madness> >this is intended
[3:32:23] <reiju_22> no its not LUL
[3:32:24] <th3madness> I mean,
[3:32:26] <+linSP> you can snipe every gunner with shuriken form the roof
[3:32:26] <ocxdc> @Nyckelus that does add a level of anxiety, i agree. I ended up with over 600 cause of my lack of using it in a lot of boss fights
[3:32:27] <PinkSocks> You're wrong Billy
[3:32:27] <%KaizenChaos> use shruriken
[3:32:27] <th3madness> kinda?
[3:32:30] <Shishi1205> Is it?
[3:32:32] <KiraKamixephos> You can just kill them you’re just being way too cautious
[3:32:33] <Tremerss> its super not, you just kill them all in 10 seconds
[3:32:34] <%laserbeaming> It doesn't feel intended. It feels cheesy StinkyCheese
[3:32:35] <+TopTieramisu> this is a very ugly method
[3:32:36] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> On some fights it is, but not this one
[3:32:37] <+duskrush> This isn't intended at all
[3:32:39] <th3madness> this is absolutely not intended
[3:32:40] <Flare3500> you guys might have game knowledge but Woolie has document knowledge
[3:32:40] <th3madness> it works
[3:32:41] <Zeemod155> This is NOT intended in any way shape or form
[3:32:43] <tearknack> so wrong
[3:32:46] <supergoober33> abusing aggro ranges is by no means the intended way, come on now
[3:32:46] <+hax_metatron> It’s not you can just kill all these adds easily!!!!
[3:32:48] <ocxdc> CHAT
[3:32:49] <th3madness> but it's very much an obtuse way of doing it
[3:32:50] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Yeah
[3:32:50] <%GabeSweetMan> This is A WAY to play but it sure as heck isn't "intended" lol
[3:32:51] <ocxdc> CHILL MAN
[3:32:51] <supersugoisenpai1> The gun guys die SO easy
[3:32:52] <ocxdc> CHILL
[3:32:53] <+frunkAF> this is exploiting the limitations of the enemy's AI. Is this really the way it's meant to be played?
[3:32:59] <Bonbie> This is very much abusing mechanics, but you can play like this if you want
[3:33:00] <%masterfire23> real shinobi method
[3:33:01] <%Lion_kun> woolie you can kill the scrubs in 3 swings, just deathblow the boss and quickly finish off the smallfry
[3:33:01] <+duskrush> The intention is to do sick parry combos
[3:33:01] <%juxtest> This is what peak performance looks like
[3:33:02] <OkamiDude15> but your not a ninja in this game sfhTHINK
[3:33:05] <Nyckelus> @woolieversus It’s inelegant.
[3:33:08] <Dragon_Batman> Running back and forth between everyone is not intended but figuring out the best way to take out a group from a stealth position is, in my opinion
[3:33:09] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> As long as youre not cheating Kappa
[3:33:16] <reiju_22> @WoolieVersus the rifle guys die pretty quick without deathblows.
[3:33:17] <tearknack> it's a method of play that the game devs expected some people to use, put it isn't the intended path
[3:33:17] <Akett> I dunno, sneaky hit and run coward feels pretty ninja to me.
[3:33:18] <Angry_Ev1L> Pray with old lady!
[3:33:19] <+Reizie_Etherealm> I get you Woolie
[3:33:22] <Flare3500> Woolie just read the document
[3:33:23] <%laserbeaming> It's not immersive
[3:33:24] <+frunkAF> this is your game. play how you want it
[3:33:26] <Luesagna00> @woolieversus a ninja? i thought he was a samurai
[3:33:29] <Inebriateddonut> It just doesn't look good is all
[3:33:34] <ocxdc> "intended way" no such thing lol just play the game and beat it
[3:33:36] <Shir0yasha> ur explaining like the document
[3:33:37] <th3madness> you can also run past every enemy in souls
[3:33:38] <Alloyed> intended is too powerful a word
[3:33:40] <%GabeSweetMan> This is the slowest way certainly.
[3:33:40] <+duskrush> Because this same game allows you to run multiple bosses off of cliffs
[3:33:42] <PinkSocks> It works, but in this instance it's better to just fight them all.
[3:33:42] <+frunkAF> unintended is a good way to put it
[3:33:43] <Alloyed> death of the author and all that
[3:33:43] <supergoober33> Because making a giant complex stealth system takes a superlong time, Billy
[3:33:45] <+hax_metatron> @luesagna00 He’s not a samurai at all!!! He’s a shinobi
[3:33:49] <+buttdirt> where's that PDF when you need it
[3:33:55] <th3madness> it can not be intended and still work
[3:33:58] <+stagemage> why did street fighter have comboes if it wasnt an intended mechanic
[3:33:59] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> "intended" is the wrong word.
[3:34:01] <kikosmore> This is funny. The gun men goes down easily. Stealth the boss then take down the gun men lol.
[3:34:01] <+This_is_Marco> Vilheim skip?
[3:34:04] <+TopTieramisu> yes
[3:34:06] <Inebriateddonut> It's like going through DMC with just combo A, guns, and dodge VS styling everything
[3:34:07] <ocxdc> @frunkAF thats actually a better way to put, i think
[3:34:08] <+duskrush> You can do it but it's not intended
[3:34:09] <th3madness> intended is not the right word
[3:34:10] <+frunkAF> this IS an exploit.
[3:34:12] <+frunkAF> no question
[3:34:13] <Flare3500> Everyone is wrong and Woolie is right because of the document
[3:34:13] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> it is an exploit
[3:34:13] <%GabeSweetMan> "Expoiting A.I is intended"
[3:34:16] <Psifonian> Yooooo what's up chat ! Happy 4 / 20
[3:34:16] <Zombrocom> Woolie is 100% correct
[3:34:17] <Ion_Laser> This is an alternate route
[3:34:17] <shotgang86> this IS an exploit
[3:34:18] <Dragon_Batman> breaking a games A.I. isn't intended usually LUL
[3:34:19] <tearknack> this is an exploit
[3:34:21] <+duskrush> An exploit is a better term
[3:34:22] <Alloyed> exploiting AI is intended
[3:34:27] <Nyckelus> Dragonrider skip in DS2 is an easy example.
[3:34:27] <Intolerable> WRONG BILLY
[3:34:27] <Luesagna00> i'm so used to ninjas wearing kike masks and atuff T.T...or wearing orange >3>
[3:34:28] <OkamiDude15> your just making this take a really long time since these dude die SUPER fast
[3:34:31] <KiraKamixephos> Definitely an exploit and not required at all
[3:34:32] <jay521> just use gameshark
[3:34:33] <Shishi1205> Its an exploit
[3:34:34] <%laserbeaming> Yeah, this is an exploit. EMBRACE THE CHEATING BILLY
[3:34:36] <+Binary_Fireball> it's an intended exploit
[3:34:36] <%GabeSweetMan> Time for Billy to get blown up on Reddit lol
[3:34:38] <Alloyed> at least in the sense that they haven't decided to remove it in mutiple iterations of the game
[3:34:38] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Tenchu Z absolutely does that
[3:34:39] <+frunkAF> Splinter Cell
[3:34:40] <+frunkAF> Hitman
[3:34:43] <$QueequegTheater> ALL STEALTH GAMES DO THIS WOOLIE
[3:34:46] <+frunkAF> ALL the stealth games
[3:34:47] <Professor_Rakor> If it was an exploit, you wouldn't be allowed to stealth bosses.
[3:34:48] <%juxtest> Just more complicated than it needs to be
[3:34:49] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> is billy serious LUL
[3:34:50] <%GabeSweetMan> THIS IS A LEGIT STRATEGY BUT IT'S AN EXPLOIT BILLY
[3:34:57] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> To be fair, this is an acceptable tactic, I think the difference is that there is an easier way to go about this and you're doing it in a roundabout way.
[3:34:57] <+frunkAF> Billy pls
[3:34:59] <th3madness> I think Minh fundamentally works on a different level than everyone else
[3:35:02] <Arweynn> Bloody crow in Amelia’s room
[3:35:03] <haisho> end of stage rankings suffer if you do that though
[3:35:04] <Shishi1205> Legit exploit
[3:35:04] <Alloyed> in most stealth games you don't notice because there are quicksaves
[3:35:08] <supergoober33> You're literally exploiting the AI amnesia because FROM isn't going to dedicate 1 billion hours to code a sophisticated alert system.
[3:35:15] <th3madness> like how many people let snake eyes die in the poison
[3:35:16] <Dragon_Batman> It's an exploit unintended but it doesn't make it bad
[3:35:18] <StarkAvKnark> Good morning, says Europe
[3:35:18] <Bonbie> Of course you CAN exploit the AI, and you're allowed to, but it's not what the designers intended. That's all there is to say
[3:35:18] <tearknack> exploits are legit strategies, but this is way slower and clunkier than the intended method of play
[3:35:18] <$QueequegTheater> Woolie there are no ranks
[3:35:20] <Mythundare> ResidentSleeper
[3:35:23] <+duskrush> This isn't that though. This is a design limitation so you don't trail like 40 dudes through the whole map
[3:35:23] <+frunkAF> there's a difference between stealth mechanics and exploiting AI limitations
[3:35:26] <Shishi1205> Now chase his ass up the stairs
[3:35:26] <reiju_22> Deathblow the boss, kill the rifle guys in 2-3 hits, but no lets waste 10 minutes because it's easier 4Head
[3:35:27] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Snake eyes dies of poison?
[3:35:28] <alexandrecau> you didn't progress minh, you cheated yourself
[3:35:36] <th3madness> if you wait 10 minutes, yeah
[3:35:38] <th3madness> it works
[3:35:38] <%GabeSweetMan> This absolutely a legit strategy it's just boring as fuck.
[3:35:40] <Zombrocom> Woolie is so right
[3:35:41] <Shir0yasha> anything for the W. ashina style
[3:35:42] <OkamiDude15> i thought snake eyes couldnt be poisoned
[3:35:43] <supersugoisenpai1> Can't wait for Woolie to die fighting the miniboss and do this routine over
[3:35:44] <+hax_metatron> Omg Woolie Billy just lies to you though!!!! The gunners are really easy to melee kill in this encounter!
[3:35:44] <Flare3500> shut up minh you don't have the document
[3:35:45] <th3madness> but i wouldn't call it intended
[3:35:50] <+GrizzleBearMAK> this is what i call a cheese
[3:35:57] <Dragon_Batman> They just force it so you don't exploit everything
[3:36:00] <%laserbeaming> The Document has given woolie too much power
[3:36:01] <+Binary_Fireball> sekiru is NOT a stealth game.
[3:36:05] <+duskrush> Those gunmen get posture broken in like 2 hits
[3:36:08] <Inebriateddonut> It's just styling VS not styling
[3:36:10] <+Binary_Fireball> it mostly wants you to fight
[3:36:11] <Shir0yasha> man the document corrupted woolie
[3:36:15] <+stagemage> isnt mihn the guy who grinds to 99 in the opening area? his intended might not be the most legit
[3:36:16] <%salty_syd913> salty_syd913 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! 4 months yeah! always glad to catch you stream!
[3:36:17] <KiraKamixephos> The gunners literally die in 2-3 hits and you get invincibility when deathblowing
[3:36:17] <Flare3500> Woolie and document name a better pair
[3:36:21] <supergoober33> I wish I could be as oblivious as Billy about being completely crazy.
[3:36:22] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> woolie is 100% right
[3:36:24] <%GabeSweetMan> Sekiro is very weak as a stealth game. Stealth is simply a tool in your arsenal.
[3:36:24] <$QueequegTheater> LUL
[3:36:29] <OkamiDude15> this is not a strealth game its an action rpg with stealth elements
[3:36:29] <+frunkAF> it's not the intended way to play the game
[3:36:29] <Ion_Laser> LUL
[3:36:30] <+TopTieramisu> elegant death blow
[3:36:30] <Luesagna00> huh...yeah i didnt know stealth was intended i thought it was more action game
[3:36:31] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> the stealth feels like it's for making areas easier to handle
[3:36:33] <vVAstrAVv> woolies right its an exploit. noone intended for him to be this slow on this boss
[3:36:35] <Alloyed> Cheese strats are how you modulate your difficulty. When you get good enough you get the reward of doing the effortless parry all the time cinematic stuff
[3:36:36] <+frunkAF> why is this so difficult to understand?
[3:36:38] <Shishi1205> Look at that blade
[3:36:39] <th3madness> I dunno man I wish woolie would just play the game without worrying about the document or billy
[3:36:43] <%GabeSweetMan> Get dat Double Ichimonji yo.
[3:36:45] <OkamiDude15> its like saying metal gear rising is a stealth game
[3:36:45] <Dragon_Batman> Nah it's boring as fuck from a E3 viewer's stand point
[3:36:49] <Zeemod155> Compared to Snake eyes this guy is a pushover
[3:36:49] <%laserbeaming> It's CHEEESE StinkyCheese
[3:36:50] <startstoprepeat> it's unfathomable to me that anyone would think this is the intended play
[3:36:55] <Afroperonista> don't die now LUL
[3:36:55] <$QueequegTheater> Woolie you gotta swing after those parries
[3:36:55] <RoboXGP> yeah the enemy AI is kind of wonk for stealth, there's nothing to hide behind except grass
[3:37:02] <ocxdc> lol get worked and have to cheese again for 20 mins
[3:37:02] <+TopTieramisu> omg
[3:37:04] <Psifonian> Mmmmmmm so Cheesey
[3:37:04] <Flare3500> Woolie use the document throw it on his face
[3:37:07] <SilverAncient> thats why he has 2 health bars. you have to fight him
[3:37:09] <+TopTieramisu> the elevation
[3:37:12] <+Binary_Fireball> don't die woolz
[3:37:13] <%laserbeaming> how did that not hit?
[3:37:14] <$Swish19XX> Ninja are the ultimate cheesers
[3:37:15] <redrins> I am baffled at the amount of people who are just shrugging off different playstyles here
[3:37:20] <Dragon_Batman> You do alot of damage to him so you got this
[3:37:22] <%GabeSweetMan> Stealth is a method that allows you to make fights easier.
[3:37:23] <Shishi1205> Woolie the shinobi tool you bought you have to equip it
[3:37:24] <tearknack> its not intended, sekiro just has shit stealth mechanics
[3:37:24] <jay521> what is this document meme
[3:37:25] <+Binary_Fireball> because if you do... then don't all agsssiinnn
[3:37:28] <%juxtest> This chump should be a walk in the park after Shirahagi
[3:37:28] <reiju_22> why not do a honest approach before cheesing it? I really don#t get it
[3:37:29] <supergoober33> @redrins Exploits are not playstyles
[3:37:29] <+Reizie_Etherealm> I miss stealth games, the last one I played is like Splinter Cell Blacklist and that's 2013
[3:37:32] <Alloyed> this game is less about stealth and more about routing around aggro if that makes sense?
[3:37:33] <+RollTheD20> the game doesn't give you a stamina bar for a reason, it gives you all the tools necessary to fight
[3:37:34] <%GabeSweetMan> Yeyeye double ichimonji
[3:37:40] <supersugoisenpai1> why
[3:37:42] <%GabeSweetMan> youch
[3:37:47] <Flare3500> use the document
[3:37:47] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pellets
[3:37:49] <Alloyed> just like in darksouls you find the line that gives you maximal backstabs or whatever
[3:37:50] <Dragon_Batman> nope
[3:37:52] <haisho> minibosses never do that
[3:37:56] <Zombrocom> No one is "shrugged off" other playstyles, people are saying that calling this the intended way to do the encounter is incorrect.
[3:38:00] <redrins> @supergoober33 they 100% are, if the devs didn't intend for this to be viable they wouldn't let you do it
[3:38:02] <PinkSocks> Should've healed
[3:38:03] <Shishi1205> get fucked
[3:38:04] <Flare3500> come on woolie it's in the document

[3:38:21] <Flare3500> should've used the document
[3:38:22] <%Lion_kun> woolie fuciing deflect
[3:38:24] <reiju_22> @WoolieVersus now do it the intended way
[3:38:26] <Mythundare> Drop your dodge button!
[3:38:26] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:38:27] <Afroperonista> LUL
[3:38:27] <+frunkAF> OH MY GOD, Billy
[3:38:31] <$Louie_Salmon> Dodging is so bad in this game
[3:38:31] <Shir0yasha> gay Paris amigo
[3:38:31] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> billy come on
[3:38:32] <ocxdc> CHAT SO MAD
[3:38:33] <candidateplays> Never sidestep a guy with a sword
[3:38:35] <th3madness> billy please
[3:38:35] <+TopTieramisu> just because you can do it doesn't mean it's "intended"
[3:38:36] <Dragon_Batman> you can't fix everything
[3:38:36] <PinkSocks> Woolie, now try to just fight all those guys, it's WAY EASIER
[3:38:37] <Djinnazz> neither is shifting through walls Mihn.
[3:38:38] <FrxstyFrxst> NotLikeThis
[3:38:38] <+TopTieramisu> have you seen a speedrun?
[3:38:38] <+Binary_Fireball> oh nooooo
[3:38:39] <+hax_metatron> Just kill the gunners melee!!!!!
[3:38:39] <Uyko112> Stay in one spot Woolie
[3:38:39] <Tremerss> resetting AI 10 fucking times isnt intended LOL
[3:38:40] <shotgang86> Woolie is still playing with a dark souls mentality
[3:38:40] <%GabeSweetMan> Woolie: "Alright so I'm gonna block until the last moment so they can hit me while I dodge."
[3:38:41] <startstoprepeat> so that game journalists can beat it
[3:38:45] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus you gotta swing after those single swing parries. He needs to get his vitality down
[3:38:48] <supersugoisenpai1> If you're not intended to abuse bugs, why are they there?
[3:38:48] <OkamiDude15> time to stealth kill all these lvl1 grunts again
[3:38:48] <reiju_22> @WoolieVersus the rifle guys die in 2-3 hits
[3:38:48] <Zeemod155> thank you Woolie
[3:38:50] <Shir0yasha> billy u never read the document
[3:38:50] <jay521> I think Billy is right
[3:38:52] <KingOfTheGeats> NotLikeThis Billy
[3:38:52] <%juxtest> These guys really arent that dangerous
[3:38:53] <shotgang86> oh my fucking god he still thinks this is an INTENDED way?
[3:38:53] <supergoober33> @redrins I think it's pretty clear the devs did not intend for you to exploit aggro ranges simply because FROM isn't going to spend 1000 hours coding a super complex stealth and alert system
[3:38:53] <+stagemage> street fighter having comboes wasnt intended
[3:38:59] <tearknack> BECAUSE they want you be able to run through a map without every enemy coming after you at once
[3:39:04] <+duskrush> I can skip the entirety of Marble Zone Act 1 in Sonic 1. That doesn't mean it's intended
[3:39:04] <Lieutori> There are so many moments where it's always better to kill all the adds before a boss in this method
[3:39:09] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> billy pls LUL
[3:39:09] <Tremerss> just deathblow the boss and kill the 3 hit enemies
[3:39:09] <Alloyed> DISCOURSE
[3:39:10] <%GabeSweetMan> LOL
[3:39:13] <%laserbeaming> It's also very time consuming
[3:39:14] <Djinnazz> omg
[3:39:16] <+d00msdaydan> ya know
[3:39:17] <reiju_22> ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[3:39:17] <th3madness> oh lord here we go
[3:39:17] <apmaxat> Pretty much every level has an intended stealth path to get you to the boss unnoticed.
[3:39:18] <Nina96> if it works in the end its fine to me
[3:39:18] <jay521> oh god here we go again
[3:39:21] <%GabeSweetMan> I thought for sure that was the boss he was targeting.
[3:39:21] <CrypticMochi> Cheesing and exploiting AI isn’t intended gameplay even if it’s a legit way of getting through it. Technical limitations can’t cover everything.
[3:39:21] <Mythundare> ResidentSleeper
[3:39:21] <Flare3500> just slap that document on the table
[3:39:22] <$Swish19XX> There are abilities that let you re-enter stealth. It's a game mechanic.
[3:39:24] <$QueequegTheater> THEY TAKE ONE SWING EACH
[3:39:24] <+linSP> its not the "coolest" way, but since its in, its intended, but its not cool
[3:39:25] <ocxdc> LUL
[3:39:26] <reiju_22> Why not try it??? LUL
[3:39:27] <Zeemod155> Is he gonna db these guys one at a time again?
[3:39:29] <PinkSocks> The gun guys take 2 hits each Woolie ResidentSleeper
[3:39:29] <%Lion_kun> Snake Eyes had arrhythmic movement so now it's fucking his rhythm with normal bosses
[3:39:30] <redrins> @supergoober33 and yet they made a game about ninjas with stealth mechanics and elements?
[3:39:31] <+duskrush> If you're not sure then try
[3:39:33] <Akett> Woolie, if you don't feel good then try to do it cool.
[3:39:33] <OkamiDude15> this is just very time consuming THEY DIE SO EASILY
[3:39:34] <+frunkAF> From Software didn't design this section with the intention of you killing one guy, running back to where the AI stops tracking, and repeating
[3:39:35] <+duskrush> You have nothing to lose
[3:39:36] <+hax_metatron> Just kill the gunners with two hits geez
[3:39:38] <ocxdc> SeemsGood
[3:39:39] <+TopTieramisu> it's not "cheating" but it's definitely not the "intended" way
[3:39:39] <kikosmore> Were wasting more time killing each one by one rather than stealthing the boss then killing the gun men
[3:39:43] <Shishi1205> minibosses
[3:39:44] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ???
[3:39:46] <KiraKamixephos> Dmc walls?
[3:39:47] <Flare3500> No chat shut up this is what the document said
[3:39:48] <%GabeSweetMan> Just because you did it that way doesn't make it "The way you are supposed to do it."
[3:39:49] <Shishi1205> At least 4 have the,
[3:39:49] <Shir0yasha> N OMEGALUL
[3:39:51] <%KaizenChaos> you can just destroy the gun guys
[3:39:53] <Bonbie> Nope. They put fog walls for minibosses, but not behind you
[3:39:53] <Professor_Rakor> well, 100% you can just kill these gunmen all at once in the face, while you are deathblowing them, you'll have iframes
[3:39:58] <+skm742> @WoolieVersus If you want to save time with these guards, just shuriken them from max range. Uses emblems, but MUCH faster
[3:40:03] <Dragon_Batman> Mini boss is still a boss of some kind
[3:40:04] <+linSP> gunners die in two ninja stars dude
[3:40:04] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> can there not be more than one intended way to play?
[3:40:05] <supergoober33> @redrins yes. Like backstabs and high grass hiding you, not running away from everything until AI amnesia kicks in because they literally did not make a system to handle it.
[3:40:08] <Inebriateddonut> The minibosses fog gates just stop progress
[3:40:08] <supersugoisenpai1> I am becoming irrationally angry
[3:40:15] <+TopTieramisu> minh is sandbagging chat. he's becoming too strong
[3:40:17] <ocxdc> go wank
[3:40:17] <+Binary_Fireball> hahahaha
[3:40:17] <Truebluemc> if he has regain vitality on deathblow, he can have full health by the time he attcaks the miniboss
[3:40:24] <tearknack> @WoolieVersus Minh is wrong, and you can put the gun enemies into a deathblow with two hits. this is a waste of time
[3:40:26] <Flare3500> the next fromsoft document
[3:40:30] <+EndgameContent> I think what Minh is saying is that, since you can stealth kill enemies, that stealth-killing and disengaging for each enemy is intended, which isn't cool
[3:40:30] <+d00msdaydan> ya know
[3:40:32] <Nyckelus> It’s intended to allow stealth but the stealth is not perfect therefore you can do more than is intended.
[3:40:34] <%GabeSweetMan> Please for the love of god just kill them all in one run.
[3:40:35] <%BurncoatRapscallion> NG you are severely underpowered so it's fine to cheese. NG+ you feel like a shinobi badass just tanking 5 enemies at a time
[3:40:35] <th3madness> I see now why billy leveled a lancer to max in FF14
[3:40:36] <%laserbeaming> The Fromsoft Incident
[3:40:41] <redrins> @supergoober33 aggro ranges were coded for a reason tho
[3:40:42] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Here's what I think the intended way to do it or at least how I always did it: Overhead kill the boss, kill the gunmens, focus on the boss.
[3:40:43] <Afroperonista> stop living in the past, woolie Kappa
[3:40:44] <Nina96> Mihn Requiem
[3:40:44] <giogio346> @WoolieVersus the rifle guys die in 2 or 3 hits, the way you are doing it is such a waste of time. it's really not that hard
[3:40:45] <$QueequegTheater> cheer500 Woolie picking off the gunners is not intended. They take one hit to kill and deathblow animations have fully invincibility
[3:40:46] <%GabeSweetMan> Kill the adds in one run THEN run away.
[3:40:48] <vVAstrAVv> oh god this again?
[3:40:53] <th3madness> he's operating on eldritch reasoning we cannot comprehend
[3:40:55] <mayorrev> nooo fighting!
[3:40:56] <supergoober33> @redrins yes, and that reason was not so you could cheese
[3:40:57] <Dragon_Batman> There was a fog wall with snake eyes Minh
[3:40:57] <ocxdc> this is the best LUL
[3:40:59] <UnfilteredComic> Dying on this hill about dying on this hill?
[3:40:59] <%UrsulaCat> WOOLIE DOES NOT LIE
[3:41:00] <Alloyed> yeah but should it have an easy mode tho Kappa
[3:41:01] <Afroperonista> dark souls is gone, is over, new era now
[3:41:04] <OkamiDude15> @th3madness sfhLUL
[3:41:04] <RoboXGP> i skipped this guy lol
[3:41:05] <+EndgameContent> But it's more of the case of, stealth kill is how to initiate a fight at an advantage, and you're expected to kill a few enemies in a cool way before disengaging if things are getting too heated.
[3:41:07] <Zombrocom> It is so much easier to just fight the gunners
[3:41:10] <PinkSocks> Mihn please, please tell Woolie to try fighting them normally, just get a stealth deathblow on the boss.
[3:41:11] <+Binary_Fireball> dunkey where art thou?
[3:41:11] <Flare3500> Woolie is operating on Document knowledge so therefore he is never wrong
[3:41:12] <+stagemage> its a correct feeling
[3:41:12] <tearknack> god this is unearable
[3:41:18] <ocxdc> Dunkey save us
[3:41:19] <+duskrush> Woolie, just TRY to fight them head on. If it doesn't work then back to stealthing. Trial and error, man
[3:41:21] <th3madness> we need pat to come in here and set this straight
[3:41:23] <%GabeSweetMan> Minh omg this is stream poison
[3:41:23] <vVAstrAVv> god damn woolie kill all the ads theyre bitches
[3:41:24] <QueequegTheater> THIS IS NOT A STEALTH GAME
[3:41:31] <giogio346> Why not just fight them normally first before doing this??? NotLikeThis
[3:41:33] <%GabeSweetMan> OMG THIS IS AWFUL
[3:41:35] <Bonbie> Why doesn't he just try
[3:41:35] <@Menitta> YES THANK YOU
[3:41:40] <+tigerfang86> JUST KILL THE GUN GUYS
[3:41:40] <+buttdirt> i think their INTENTION was to give you multiple options to approach a situation that's best suited for you
[3:41:41] <+Binary_Fireball> it's action
[3:41:41] <redrins> @supergoober33 neither of us can really say if it was or not, we weren't involved in the development of the game, certainly they were aware of this in QA and left it in however
[3:41:42] <Dragon_Batman> It's a shame he hasn't gone inside the castle and lead him in
[3:41:42] <supergoober33> just hit that one guy Woolie please
[3:41:43] <ocxdc> Chat is gonna have a collective aneurysm
[3:41:44] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> jesus LUL
[3:41:46] <+Reizie_Etherealm> I think Billy is not being completely clear. I think he means it's intended that resetting aggro CAN be a thing but resetting aggro itself is not the intended as the main method, I don't know anymore... >_<
[3:41:46] <+EndgameContent> It's like style in DMC - if you're really good, you can initiate a fight a stealth kill, and then kill everyone else without running away. But Woolie's not that good yet.
[3:41:48] <+TopTieramisu> whoaaa he sees you
[3:41:50] <%GabeSweetMan> Woolie you should just do it the way YOU WANT TO
[3:41:51] <Flare3500> Because the document
[3:41:52] <Shir0yasha> fuck the devs fuck the document. just win 4Head ashina style
[3:41:53] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Lieutori
[3:41:53] <+TopTieramisu> or not
[3:41:54] <QueequegTheater> Read my donation you silly man
[3:41:56] <RoboXGP> woolie thinks every boss is snake eyes now
[3:42:05] <%GabeSweetMan> HESITATION IS DEFEAT
[3:42:07] <opiwv> this shit
[3:42:09] <supersugoisenpai1> People have beat the game in less time than this strat is taking
[3:42:09] <Flare3500> Woolie will not read donations only documents
[3:42:18] <Afroperonista> this shit is straight darksydewoolie right now LUL
[3:42:18] <KiraKamixephos> Woolie please just fight them or spam shuriken at them
[3:42:19] <jay521> What the hell is this document meme
[3:42:21] <%GabeSweetMan> WUUUUUUT
[3:42:22] <+starzo0> @buttdirt but hes not doing it the way i would, so its wrong Kappa
[3:42:23] <%GabeSweetMan> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[3:42:28] <th3madness> woolie can't read
[3:42:28] <Luesagna00> So this game has stealth elements to use as ambushes and backstabs??
[3:42:30] <Kaendorth> not stealth, but they give the tools to put yourself in an advantage by using stealth, even in trailers they did that, let enemies move away before ressurrecting and going for a stealth hit
[3:42:30] <BabyNaBackbrace> "Sekiro needs to respect its players and not let them use exploits to win"
[3:42:31] <ocxdc> @Afroperonista LUL
[3:42:32] <+peanutprophet> woolie can't hear us, he has his airpods in
[3:42:35] <th3madness> but he can read the document
[3:42:36] <Uyko112> He's missing a key on a path on that bridge for a Prosthetic later.
[3:42:36] <+frunkAF> Guard: Damn...he's right there but it's just outside of my pathing. Guess I'll just forget about it
[3:42:38] <supergoober33> @redrins QA "left in" aggro ranges? QA isn't capable of removing aggro ranges, what are you on about? FROM used the same system as in every previous Souls game that enemies forget about you if you get far enough away, that is not an excuse to cheese.
[3:42:45] <RoboXGP> my illiterate racism asking why/
[3:42:45] <giogio346> @WoolieVersus the guys with the rifles die in like 2 hits. you dont have to waste so much time
[3:42:47] <@Menitta> his AirKirby
[3:42:52] <+This_is_Marco> Honestly I miss the janky weird mess dark souls 3 became. Sashimi dudes are just discount soul stream builds
[3:42:52] <Djinnazz> This is gonna be a hard one to clip.
[3:43:01] <PinkSocks> I hope he never does this again for another miniboss
[3:43:04] <%wolfofsound> wolfofsound subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Yolo 420 bro, haha j/k dawg str8 edge 4 life, ready for that easter sunday for christ dawg
[3:43:07] <redrins> @supergoober33 not aggro ranges, they left in the fact taht you could indeed do this
[3:43:07] <+AbnormalVoid> why's the gate closed?
[3:43:08] <supergoober33> This is like 10 minutes of setup for each attempt
[3:43:15] <%Lion_kun> this is literally the worst, you could kill all those guys in 5 seconds
[3:43:16] <QueequegTheater> @wolfofsound Are you his brother
[3:43:17] <@Menitta> jesus that sub message
[3:43:17] <+Binary_Fireball> where is Pat?
[3:43:18] <+TopTieramisu> why won't woolie use the shinobi tools
[3:43:21] <Flare3500> clip this then send it to fromsoft and title it as Document
[3:43:22] <th3madness> go backstab him
[3:43:26] <%laserbeaming> shuriken is great
[3:43:29] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @Binary_Fireball you mean the guy who bruteforced the game?
[3:43:29] <Shir0yasha> actual ResidentSleeper
[3:43:30] <+Binary_Fireball> we need his ginger buddah knowledge
[3:43:32] <+frunkAF> cheese him again
[3:43:33] <%BurncoatRapscallion> honestly if they keep putting in the same aggro and lashing system in every game its Froms fault that people abuse it
[3:43:34] <startstoprepeat> what would the snailborne equivalent for sekiro be? slowkiro?
[3:43:34] <OkamiDude15> cant wait for this fight to take a whole session on woolie versus
[3:43:39] <%wolfofsound> @QueequegTheater we're all brothers............in christ
[3:43:42] <%GabeSweetMan> @WoolieVersus Woolie please NEVER use this strategy for other bosses. Once you get the health for death blows skill it's actually worthwhile to keep around adds to heal off of.
[3:43:46] <+Binary_Fireball> but now he knows!!!
[3:43:48] <supergoober33> @redrins Yes, it was in every previous game as well. That does not make it a playstyle. If you exploit the AI, you're just cheesing.
[3:43:48] <ocxdc> what is the "document" meme? im los
[3:43:49] <+Binary_Fireball> I hope
[3:43:52] <%Lion_kun> woolie this isn't snake eyes, just block
[3:43:56] <+duskrush> This really is the "nothing wastes more time than trying to save time" theory
[3:44:01] <Dragon_Batman> Sekislow?
[3:44:05] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @Binary_Fireball youre talking about a guy who plays super cautious vs a guy who slams his head at the enemy until he wins
[3:44:08] <OkamiDude15> @duskrush god your right
[3:44:11] <%Lion_kun> he's so easy but snake eyes fucked your rhythm
[3:44:13] <%laserbeaming> II think when enemies are in the air they get knocked down by shurikens? I'm not sure if it's universal
[3:44:21] <Flare3500> This is Sekiro : Documents Twice
[3:44:28] <Shishi1205> Woolie has been aclimated to hard fights now he fights everything to that degree
[3:44:28] <%GabeSweetMan> This guy has like 1/4 of the health Snake Eyes had.
[3:44:30] <QueequegTheater> @ocxdc Activision gave early copies of the game to streamers/LPers/reviewers and it came with a design document that had a lot of game info
[3:44:30] <Zombrocom> Woo
[3:44:31] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> THERE
[3:44:32] <supersugoisenpai1> Thank god
[3:44:32] <%KaizenChaos> woolieWOOLZ woolieWOOLZ woolieWOOLZ
[3:44:33] <redrins> @supergoober33 cheesing is a playstyle, idk what you want me to say, I completed this section by killing all of them from the inside of the castle to the outside, but to me this is just as legit
[3:44:34] <supergoober33> @ocxdc Woolie received a review copy for this game and it came with a document sort of saying what the game's about. He brought it up when fighting Snake Eyes about how the document said that you should play aggressive. Now it's a meme that the document holds all answers.
[3:44:36] <th3madness> wow, fighting the boss actually worked
[3:44:39] <%GabeSweetMan> Thank christ.
[3:44:41] <OkamiDude15> fucken a
[3:44:41] <Mythundare> Just as planned
[3:44:44] <KingOfTheGeats> thank god for the document
[3:44:46] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Breakfast_Megapowers subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 5 month streak! Glad to see you streaming MediocreBlackOtaku, but seriously glad to catch the stream!
[3:44:47] <Uyko112> Just block woolie!! Stand your ground!
[3:44:48] <PinkSocks> Wow, it's almost like you're supposed to fight him alongside 5 gunners
[3:44:50] <$Swish19XX> Chat is a nightmare with Sekiro
[3:44:54] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> I think Woolie was just scared at the gunmens not knowing they die easily
[3:44:58] <%GabeSweetMan> Fighting Snake Eyes before this really made him scared of minibosses.
[3:44:59] <ocxdc> Ahhhhhhh, thanks again chat SeemsGood
[3:44:59] <Flare3500> the document is basically the enchiridion
[3:45:01] <%Lion_kun> cheesing is legit but when doing it legit is much faster and easier, it;'s just dumb to cheese it
[3:45:05] <Kaendorth> @laserbeaming there are different kinds of "airbourne" stattes in the game, his overhead isn't considered airbourne
[3:45:10] <QueequegTheater> Only took six playthroughs of Persona 5 worth of time
[3:45:10] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Kill them before you die
[3:45:11] <Shir0yasha> divine grass. happy 420 bois
[3:45:11] <opiwv> the castlesuperbeast clip on his yt channel him and pat talk about the document a lot
[3:45:16] <Nina96> @Swish19XX thats any fromsoft game
[3:45:17] <Zeemod155> Helll yeah divine grass 4/20
[3:45:18] <RoboXGP> hemp
[3:45:20] <BabyNaBackbrace> It's almost a theme of the game that "Winning the Fight has nothing to do with Honor and Appearances"
[3:45:21] <+GrizzleBearMAK> that was boring as fuck to watch how that played out
[3:45:22] <+Reizie_Etherealm> @ocxdc Pat and Woolie has referenced a pdf document that supposedly elaborates on the details of the game and gives some advice on how it should be played
[3:45:24] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> OP Strats= Not Dying
[3:45:31] <tearknack> @WoolieVersus sekiro has bassically the same aggro system that the souls games do. the only reason its a "stealth game" is because they added a crouc button and a stealth attack
[3:45:31] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:45:31] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Kappa
[3:45:32] <KiraKamixephos> I think it’s just cuz the game still hasn’t clicked for woolie. It probably will with the genichiro fight
[3:45:38] <QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus It's equivalent to a divine blessing
[3:45:39] <%Lion_kun> shut up moobot
[3:45:40] <supergoober33> @redrins Cheesing is the lack of a playstyle, it's depriving yourself of the game. Dark Souls also had a dupe glitch that made it past QA, I guess that's a playstyle too.
[3:45:48] <%GabeSweetMan> yeyeye vendor!
[3:45:50] <QueequegTheater> full heal + status heal
[3:45:51] <%GabeSweetMan> WOOLIE WHY
[3:45:51] <ocxdc> fuckin moobot
[3:45:58] <Nina96> @KiraKamixephos or not at all
[3:46:00] <QueequegTheater> KILL THEM THEN
[3:46:00] <Uyko112> Divine grass saved my ass on Owl lol.
[3:46:04] <ZaibatsuFan> aww, good ol' Genichiro
[3:46:04] <%wolfofsound> shadows back down twice Kappa
[3:46:07] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> WOW I can follow Woolie on Twitter? AMAZING
[3:46:08] <sirrice77> the genichiro fight forces you to get the game because you sorta have to
[3:46:13] <redrins> @supergoober33 sure is and it sure as heck isn't gonna deprive people of fun if they want to play it legit
[3:46:24] <+linSP> did wools get the prosthetic in the reservoir
[3:46:26] <%Lion_kun> I tend to cheese when doing it as intended is too hard for me, I don't cheese when doing it properly is way easier and quicker lol
[3:46:35] <ArthurDoyleRPG> @supergoober33 You're memeing right about depriving yourself? LUL
[3:46:37] <+starzo0> @supergoober33 cheese is a play style tho, i have fun cheeseing bosses
[3:46:44] <+Reizie_Etherealm> I like how everyone takes a look at Sekiro man and just go "shinobi desu ne~"
[3:46:44] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I am a Batosai and I DO NOT love the little kiddies
[3:46:45] <+bbHighvalor> @supergoober33 Its called the "Anything to Win" strategy
[3:46:50] <Akett> He didn't get the reservoir prosthetic.
[3:46:52] <QueequegTheater> @supergoober33 Dark Souls literally had a unique animation for cheesing one of its bosses
[3:46:56] <ocxdc> its called "Ashina Style"
[3:46:56] <Flare3500> @Lion_kun exactly but the document said be a bitch to the rifle enemies so Woolie is gonna do that
[3:46:59] <%wolfofsound> @Breakfast_Megapowers D:
[3:47:08] <QueequegTheater> FROMSoft games actively encourage cheesing the shit out of them
[3:47:12] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Nightjar ninjas are chumps
[3:47:15] <%GabeSweetMan> @QueequegTheater You're referring to Endless Discharge?
[3:47:16] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @wolfofsound Kappa ?
[3:47:17] <Nina96> @starzo0 cheese can be pretty fun and hilarious
[3:47:23] <QueequegTheater> @GabeSweetMan Ceaseless
[3:47:36] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @QueequegTheater Verile
[3:47:36] <%wolfofsound> @Breakfast_Megapowers remember how he kept offering to babysit monkaS
[3:47:36] <%GabeSweetMan> Same difference. It's all a cum metaphor anyways.
[3:47:36] <+duskrush> I don't think he's gonna make it to the top of the roof if he doesn't learn to parry.
[3:47:41] <Professor_Rakor> So, now he's good, he'll go back to firelink.
[3:47:42] <haisho> night a mission, just a hint to what the smoke is for
[3:47:44] <QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Go down the stairs and do big murder
[3:47:48] <shadow1man9> @WoolieVersus That memo just hints at how to get in the castle
[3:47:52] <tearknack> @WoolieVersus it jsut tells you that the roofs with smoke coming from theem have ninja on them
[3:47:54] <+duskrush> There are some enemies in there who force you to learn to parry
[3:47:59] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Hes fine, a boss is there specifically to make him learn parry
[3:48:01] <Uyko112> @LinSP No but he doing the castle first but he does need the key in this area to get it.
[3:48:11] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @wolfofsound Oh yea I know, I watched the full series like a month before it came out
[3:48:12] <%Lion_kun> woolie's problem is he keeps second guessing himself and can't adapt to the different rhythms of different enemies
[3:48:20] <Professor_Rakor> Normally you talk to him first, then kill everyone nearby. Because you've killed them once, it counts.
[3:48:22] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> He just told you to kill all the enemies in the surrounding area
[3:48:31] <Professor_Rakor> firelink shrine!
[3:48:32] <Dragon_Batman> Back home he means
[3:48:33] <Videogamer4> NotLikeThis
[3:48:35] <supersugoisenpai1> Dillapidated temple
[3:48:37] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Bagoda?
[3:48:40] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Dilapidated
[3:48:41] <Shishi1205> Dilapidated
[3:48:43] <Flare3500> Woolie just read the document to progress
[3:48:44] <ArgentUndaCova> Dilupee Temple?
[3:48:45] <+duskrush> Dilapidated temple
[3:48:45] <jay521> dee-lah-pi-day-ted
[3:48:46] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Dilapitated
[3:48:46] <%wolfofsound> @Breakfast_Megapowers Wait even the jesus, magic and ninja/knights arcs?
[3:48:50] <PinkSocks> Diapidated
[3:48:57] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @wolfofsound totally
[3:48:58] <%GabeSweetMan> Woolie would be much better off just playing with ZERO input tbh. Just input for sidequests and the like. The better method of play is "do what works for YOU."
[3:49:02] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Dee-lah-goo-ree-las
[3:49:09] <Inebriateddonut> We need to backseat minh on pronounciation Kappa
[3:49:23] <ZaibatsuFan> Run-down, shitty, Pat-like Temple
[3:49:29] <Flare3500> The document needs to be on the couch to backseat too
[3:49:32] <%wolfofsound> @Breakfast_Megapowers now that's a real fan, it's still one of my favorites even with that last half
[3:49:34] <Dragon_Batman> eating is a good thing to do
[3:49:35] <jay521> Look at that belly
[3:49:38] <%UrsulaCat> hungwy woofie

[3:49:57] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Woolie is your Tamagotchi
[3:49:58] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Don't forget Minh can speak 3 languages, him not being min maxed in English is understandable
[3:49:58] <%GabeSweetMan> He is become hunger
[3:49:59] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> This Way
[3:50:00] <%Lion_kun> no offense to Minh but if pat saw what Woolie did, he would lsoe his shit lol

[3:50:48] <shadow1man9> That Gourd Seed though
[3:50:48] <Flare3500> the document said buy the gourd seed I read the document jsut now
[3:50:54] <%GabeSweetMan> Always save for Gourd.
[3:51:00] <+InstiGaitan> Buy ever coin purse
[3:51:05] <%GabeSweetMan> Woolie, you're AT a perfect grinding point.
[3:51:06] <+duskrush> You need the healing
[3:51:08] <Professor_Rakor> You won't be able to get the weapon for a while anyway.
[3:51:11] <Dragon_Batman> Which weapon is that?
[3:51:12] <Flare3500> But the document said gourd seed
[3:51:15] <%wolfofsound> how many gates has woolie unlocked?
[3:51:15] <%GabeSweetMan> Upper Chamber is one of the best grinding spots.
[3:51:17] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> imagine a Souls game but it has gacha Kappa
[3:51:17] <Professor_Rakor> weapon upgrade, rather.
[3:51:19] <Uyko112> You need that Gourd Seed
[3:51:22] <Dragon_Batman> The phantom dagger?
[3:51:26] <haisho> don't worry about the memos. If you explore, you'll bump into em
[3:51:28] <+duskrush> You need all the healing
[3:51:30] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Time to HUSTLE
[3:51:31] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Yeah the healing will help you immensely and the weapon is cool to have
[3:51:35] <%sirisvirus> Memos just hint where the weapons are
[3:51:50] <tearknack> i think minh is going to try to get woolie to perfectly stealth through the castle, and he won't even reach genichiro
[3:51:54] <%GabeSweetMan> Minh......
[3:51:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> CaptainPileDriver subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! YOU LIVE, i'm so glad, glad to be back for 5 months, continue living woolie and i'll be here forever

[3:53:12] <jay521> yes

[3:53:28] <+duskrush> You don't lose the gold when you die if it's in a sack though
[3:53:28] <Dragon_Batman> ye it's the same amount
[3:53:31] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Ok thank you

[3:53:35] <tearknack> @Uyko112 i imagine if you miss the tip from the guy in the past about where the raven feather and the purple guy are

[4:00:47] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> every prosthetic has some uses
[4:00:47] <QueequegTheater> Eel liver is literally the most useless item in the game
[4:00:49] <KiraKamixephos> It’s pretty useless
[4:00:50] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @QueequegTheater you need to send it back
[4:00:52] <Dragon_Batman> I never used livers either
[4:00:54] <+RaikenTB> Soon Kappa
[4:00:54] <%GabeSweetMan> You might as well just sell them lol
[4:00:55] <%MightyMaxT> LIGHTNING ATTACK! AWW AWW
[4:00:58] <%GabeSweetMan> eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh
[4:00:58] <Inebriateddonut> @QueequegTheater well you still take a tiny bit tho
[4:01:01] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @QueequegTheater otherwise even if you jump you still take the hit
[4:01:02] <@Menitta> LIGHTNING BOLT
[4:01:04] <Zombrocom> The way this game works is that every prothetic generally has an enemy that it counters, an enemy that that tool is best against
[4:01:04] <%wolfofsound> lightning bolt
[4:01:04] <QueequegTheater> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli Which is super easy
[4:01:04] <%ChoculaUltra> TYPHOON
[4:01:05] <+InstiGaitan> ROAR SABIMARU
[4:01:06] <aizt> He didnt check key items!!!
[4:01:07] <DeathByPoke7> stabbymaru
[4:01:11] <tearknack> god damnit
[4:01:14] <%wolfofsound> @Menitta Kappa
[4:01:14] <@Menitta> FREEZE ICE STORM
[4:01:15] <Shir0yasha> HOWL ZABIMARU!
[4:01:15] <jay521> thats zabimaru
[4:01:16] <%GabeSweetMan> Blush-imaru
[4:01:18] <%juxtest> Stink Blade
[4:01:18] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Ah
[4:01:19] <+RaikenTB> Anti woman sword Kappa
[4:01:20] <Zeemod155> Bankai!
[4:01:21] <+cvp5127> bleach?
[4:01:23] <%GabeSweetMan> Kawaii-maru
[4:01:24] <+hax_metatron> Best prosthetic PogChamp
[4:01:27] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Now I see why this thing is called sabimaru
[4:01:28] <Dragon_Batman> It's really neat
[4:01:30] <alexandrecau> yay now we can ritual sudoku
[4:01:32] <Zombrocom> Good ol sabimaru
[4:01:37] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Sabimaru means rust circle
[4:01:38] <aizt> IT WAS AT The BOTTOM I SAW IT
[4:01:41] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @QueequegTheater you say that but there was one guy standing on the big tree where i practiced that return and its tricky
[4:01:50] <satans_finest_millennial> yeyeyeyeyeyeyeye your stream sold me this game on the 29th love it so glad i dropped by
[4:01:50] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @QueequegTheater luckily the bosses who do use them are easier
[4:01:51] <%GabeSweetMan> Sabimaru is super good since it works on *most* enemies.
[4:01:52] <Flare3500> Sugars are really cool
[4:01:56] <+cvp5127> never use em
[4:01:59] <Dragon_Batman> For shits and giggles go ahead
[4:02:03] <+linSP> some people use their items
[4:02:03] <%masterfire23> dorodoro the videogame
[4:02:04] <drewslo> you get a billion of them
[4:02:10] <+GrizzleBearMAK> That Sugar sounded like a Green Blossom
[4:02:10] <KiraKamixephos> You won’t
[4:02:15] <%GabeSweetMan> OH NO IT'S THE PAT MENTALITY
[4:02:18] <+stagemage> oh hey pat is here
[4:02:19] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> What if you need them later
[4:02:19] <+RaikenTB> I beat the Ako headless early on.
[4:02:19] <satans_finest_millennial> how long streaming?
[4:02:19] <Zombrocom> Well, if you never use them are you wasting them just the same
[4:02:20] <QueequegTheater> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli Do you mean the guy who guards the lake? Because you're not supposed to return it to him
[4:02:23] <haisho> it's fine you get so much. You're turning into Pat, Woolie
[4:02:24] <Nina96> oh hi pat
[4:02:25] <%wolfofsound> the goblins got wooie!
[4:02:26] <+PenmanLupine> Pat is here
[4:02:28] <Intolerable> STOP BEING PAT!
[4:02:29] <+cvp5127> got it never use it
[4:02:31] <Psyramics> sugar lasts like 15 seconds
[4:02:33] <Flare3500> Totally don't use divine confetti
[4:02:34] <KingOfTheGeats> Pat goblins got Woolie
[4:02:36] <%jinking79> helpful against the Headless bosses
[4:02:37] <kikosmore> Resin felt more effective imo
[4:02:39] <+linSP> but the items make it EASIER
[4:02:39] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @QueequegTheater the guy who lightning you when you swim in Fountainhead
[4:02:40] <%GabeSweetMan> PAT HAS INFECTED WOOLIE
[4:02:40] <QueequegTheater> He is becoming Poolie
[4:02:41] <Zombrocom> Sugars last 30 seconds
[4:02:48] <london_flexing> NO. WOOLIE is RIGHT
[4:02:49] <VritraReiRei> CONSUMABLES
[4:02:51] <Parapattern> You literally get infinite sugars later in the game
[4:02:52] <+linSP> whats the point of making it HARDER
[4:02:52] <%ChoculaUltra> dragon diabetes should've been a mechanic for using too much of the sugars imo.
[4:02:54] <jay521> there;s a skill to increase the sugar buff to 45 I think
[4:02:55] <aizt> GROOSeS Theme IS ON FULL BLAST RN
[4:02:57] <gryffinp> Sekiro has diabetes, no sugar allowed
[4:02:59] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @QueequegTheater i got close to him and practiced the lightning return
[4:03:00] <FkCritter> NUMBER GOES DOWN
[4:03:02] <Shir0yasha> not false LULW
[4:03:03] <xeros720> woolie picked the worst example though, fire paper makes you do like 4x damage on Blood Starved
[4:03:03] <+linSP> they GIVE you a better sword, USE IT
[4:03:03] <Paperware> the goblins got woolie too
[4:03:05] <%GabeSweetMan> Diabetes run
[4:03:05] <drewslo> you get an infinite sugar later
[4:03:17] <+InstiGaitan> Honestly I like never used sabimaru
[4:03:18] <Flare3500> that Yashiraku Sugar looks really cool when activating
[4:03:18] <%GabeSweetMan> I hope he targets the water for THAT head fuck.
[4:03:19] <KiraKamixephos> Always rely on skill never use consumables
[4:03:20] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> but what if Woolie needs it later
[4:03:20] <QueequegTheater> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli Yeah, he's not meant to be returned, you're supposed to go through the buildings until you reach him. By that point he stops doing it and he stays dead when you kill him
[4:03:24] <%GabeSweetMan> I was SO CONFUSED.
[4:03:24] <Shishi1205> Dudes by the bridge @WoolieVersus
[4:03:25] <%wolfofsound> y'know I bet it's the redbull that gives you goblins
[4:03:26] <+InstiGaitan> I wasnt that big of a fan
[4:03:37] <xeros720> redbull, it gives you goblins
[4:03:37] <apmaxat> Sabimaru is very good for a couple minibosses that are very weak to poison
[4:03:42] <apmaxat> cough cough gun fort cough cough
[4:03:42] <Dragon_Batman> They're back
[4:03:45] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @QueequegTheater i know, but i wanted to see how the return works because ive been doing it by luck before that point
[4:03:47] <Zombrocom> Shinobi Hunter returns!
[4:03:53] <Flare3500> Yumm
[4:03:54] <Zombrocom> Too early
[4:03:56] <+duskrush> You were early
[4:03:58] <haisho> no you did it too early
[4:04:00] <MajorCrasher> LUL
[4:04:00] <Inebriateddonut> wayy too early
[4:04:00] <Zeemod155> you mikiri'd the wall
[4:04:01] <+InstiGaitan> This guy wrecked my shit so much
[4:04:02] <+AbnormalVoid> apparently you didn't kappa

[4:04:02] <+Grayhammatter> LUL

[4:04:07] <QueequegTheater> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli Fair enough. It's just really strange that you decided to practice with him, but that makes sense
[4:04:08] <Flare3500> You mikiri his penis

[4:21:34] <+Reizie_Etherealm> @RaikenTB Sorry for prolonging this conversation, I always jump at the chance to use JP cause I don't get a lot of those
[4:22:04] <CorvoBrooks> dang never listen to this much of this song but its awesome
[4:22:12] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I remember when Matt was declaring that Steak didn't count as breakfast and that is STILL wild
[4:22:27] <+RaikenTB> @Reizie_Etherealm That's fine. ネットに多いけど興味深い依頼人が少ないんだ。
[4:22:31] <%UrsulaCat> who wants to get high and read elfquest with me
[4:22:42] <ZaibatsuFan> @Breakfast_Megapowers Did he specify what kind?
[4:22:56] <@Menitta> I hate that one

[4:23:06] <+TopTieramisu> man, these shirts
[4:23:13] <+TopTieramisu> can't get enough of them
[4:23:19] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @ZaibatsuFan No just that Woolie not eating eggs and instead having steak was wrong to be called breakfast

[4:25:09] <Dragon_Batman> Probably a difficulty in its own right
[4:25:13] <DXLelouch24> my PS4 controller is what I used
[4:25:14] <+Reizie_Etherealm> @RaikenTB I see. Regardless of the difficulties of the work I think that's an incredibly useful skill to have. I'm also gonna stop this conversation before we clutter up the chat anymore with our JP gibberish lol
[4:25:21] <anovertmoose> I gotta ask, what's the deal with all the edgy cringey t-shirts
[4:25:22] <@SoushinSen> we're almost back
[4:25:34] <Nina96> @anovertmoose to hurt us

[4:27:24] <Dragon_Batman> One cannot simply smell the Wool
[4:27:36] <DXLelouch24> just sitting here watching MK Legacy
[4:27:38] <ZaibatsuFan> I see
[4:27:48] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Woolie obviously smells like a clean person because he doesn't play competitive Melee
[4:27:48] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:28:05] <+ForteBlade> I imagine he smells of jerky and despair
[4:28:09] <+TopTieramisu> @Breakfast_Megapowers so is the intro him masking his scent to infiltrate the smash scene?
[4:28:13] <Nina96> Woolie is at a level of smell we mortals cannot detect
[4:28:19] <ZaibatsuFan> @UrsulaCat Mind if I join you?
[4:28:21] <+Reizie_Etherealm> @RaikenTB Also my skill in JP is completely artificial, I don't actually know much except for how to sound convincing using Google Translate lol
[4:28:24] <Dragon_Batman> I'm in the middle of watching some legacy as well

[4:29:08] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @TopTieramisu its like the end of Walking Dead season 1, if you wear a filthy Melee players hoodie you can join in unscathed

[4:30:31] <Fadedblank247> yeah save up for Breath of Life
[4:30:43] <shadow1man9> Suppress Presence is actually pretty good
[4:31:06] <gryffinp> The real problem with posture recovery on deathblow is that your posture never matters because SURELY you are perfect parrying EVERYTHING, right?
[4:31:06] <DXLelouch24> breath of life heals you every time you deathblow
[4:31:32] <gryffinp> (but also because posture breaks aren't really that bad, you can usually dodge out)
[4:31:32] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Hello, Jesus needs your help. Send your credit card info, name and the digits on the back so that he can defeat the devil
[4:32:11] <+Reizie_Etherealm> @RaikenTB That's cool, as troublesome and as difficult as that might've been I'm sure you created some wonderful memories there! The real treasure is the friends you made alone the way or some such, sorry to be presumptuous tho

[4:32:52] <+RaikenTB> @Reizie_Etherealm It had its moments.
[4:33:09] <+Cthulos> @DXLelouche24
[4:33:33] <+TopTieramisu> anyone else feel like posture break should be more devastating for the player?
[4:33:37] <DXLelouch24> you'll get it one day
[4:33:40] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> NOICE
[4:33:46] <+Reizie_Etherealm> @RaikenTB You don't sound too enthusiastic, nothing life ruiningly bad happened right?
[4:33:47] <Ultimatefool> That was SO SICK

[4:34:19] <+RaikenTB> @Reizie_Etherealm Nah. But living as a foreigner in Japan isn't the greatest.
[4:34:29] <Dragon_Batman> Yea it's a super hint
[4:34:39] <$Mighty_observer> ran out of class

[4:35:55] <@akuda_bar> LUL

[4:35:56] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> KILL THOSE PUPPERS SwiftRage
[4:35:59] <+RaikenTB> @Reizie_Etherealm More like xenophobia. It's different in some ways.
[4:36:04] <@akuda_bar> break his bones fairly quickly
[4:36:08] <haisho> I feel like borking the pupper with an Ichimonji is a little too much but you do you
[4:36:11] <$Mighty_observer> woolie canr explore because this will turn into a 24 hour stream
[4:36:20] <+Cthulos> ! PU P S S N U F F E D !

[4:37:37] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @Calek hes trying to show woolie something before he leaves
[4:37:47] <+Reizie_Etherealm> @RaikenTB Hmm, I think I can guess how those two are different. I won't push any further tho and I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you're happy with the present if you can't say the same for your past.
[4:38:03] <+RaikenTB> @Reizie_Etherealm I am. Thank you.

[4:42:12] <Akett> According to the wiki there are enough of each ooze.
[4:42:22] <+AbnormalVoid> Chimpanzee That, Monkey Booze
[4:42:24] <+RaikenTB> I just kept drinking with Emma LUL
[4:42:26] <DXLelouch24> Woolie
[4:42:28] <Professor_Rakor> She can drink that booze....later.
[4:42:39] <haisho> the ability to give Emma booze is progression locked
[4:42:51] <@akuda_bar> the ability to give emma booze is appreciated
[4:42:54] <CorvoBrooks> No it’s fine
[4:42:57] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> you can find more, theyre missable but there are more
[4:43:03] <+AbnormalVoid> There's more, you can give any alcohol to any person who can drink alcohol
[4:43:08] <@Menitta> I could go for booze
[4:43:13] <Dragon_Batman> You can give it to her later and there is enough to go around
[4:43:14] <+RaikenTB> I think there's three people you can drink with in total.
[4:43:16] <candidateplays> Might want to have the NPC on Camera, Woolz
[4:43:43] <Tenchi_G> There are more mpc's that can drink
[4:43:44] <energywarning> yeah... clash "swords"
[4:44:04] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Booze made from MOnkeys?
[4:44:20] <tearknack> booze made by monkeys
[4:44:20] <+RaikenTB> I forgot about this bit of lore NotLikeThis
[4:44:24] <%HDmexiqtioner> HDmexiqtioner subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 3 month streak! Aye. 4 Months. Hope is well, Woolie and Minh. Hope all is well. Where does this game rank in your BloodSouls experience? Also opinions on Metallica yesterday?
[4:44:26] <billysan291> The beginning half of this game kinda gives off a lot of false impressions I think. You kinda assume the timing for everything is very strict and that the whole game is going to be super hard.
[4:44:29] <CorvoBrooks> Booze that monkeys drink
[4:44:31] <@akuda_bar> fermented monkey poop
[4:44:33] <SilverAncient> made by monkeys
[4:44:36] <haisho> monkeys accidentally brew them in hollowed tree trunks
[4:44:37] <tradingcat17217> Booze is just rotten fruit
[4:44:43] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Booze for Monkey Parties
[4:44:48] <Tucker0603> made by monkeys
[4:44:51] <candidateplays> It's fruits and dew that are fermented in trees. You read the description
[4:45:00] <haisho> time to meet OUR BOI HANBEI
[4:45:04] <tearknack> @woolieversus the item description told you
[4:45:22] <haisho> wait Woolie do it when training with Hanbei. It won't spend emblems
[4:45:29] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Now youre a Ninja

[4:45:37] <$Mighty_observer> do it hard style

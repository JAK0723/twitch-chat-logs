[0:23:22] <%fatal_penguin_> Is this the Unlockable DLC for RE2
[0:23:22] <ultimate_joker_main> oh mon dieu
[0:23:22] <ToastyBroDude> 3-0
[0:23:23] <+SolidusRex> I saw the RE2 notification too, that's why I got in here.
[0:23:31] <WG101> SHOW EM WHAT YOU GOT, MAC BABY!
[0:23:39] <ToastyBroDude> @SolidusRex Lol me too
[0:23:39] <BigNerdSam> Man, @woolieversus is doing great in RE2!
[0:23:43] <Prons> This is RE2. Can't you see Mr X in his trench coat right there?
[0:23:47] <UnstableHamster> Man Woolie got bopped last stream and has been hitting the lab, nice.
[0:23:50] <TheNewJapanGuy> ^
[0:23:58] <KeiPrime> look theres steve burnside right there too
[0:24:06] <ToastyBroDude> Man they should really nerf Mr. X. He's too good.
[0:24:12] <+starzo0> I have sub-baseline knowledge of tekken, if I were to pick a main based solely on looks, who would upset you the most
[0:24:13] <pillowwasp> Mr x isn’t a balanced character
[0:24:17] <cdrom321> @solidusrex The stream title is Tekken 7. What happened?
[0:24:17] <+a_moloch> Any one else noticed Pat looks weird this stream?
[0:24:22] <%fatal_penguin_> Mr X too OP
[0:24:24] <Chow_Wow1> can you escape regular grabs with 1+2, rather than 1 OR 2?
[0:24:36] <%Solidnick18> nerf guns
[0:24:39] <Second_Omega> @starzo0 Lucky Chloe
[0:24:39] <+Rust_Wick> the boost he gets from dmxs song is op
[0:24:40] <%AliveInside191> @starzo0 hey Star :D
[0:24:41] <+ShinobiAJ> no 1+2 is not a valid throw escape for regular throws
[0:24:42] <ToastyBroDude> Mr. X's grabs are inescapable, it's SO BULLSHIT
[0:24:42] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[0:24:46] <NarcissistCactus> do korean backdashes you cowards
[0:24:57] <+ShinobiAJ> you can react to all grabs with correct breaks anyways so its kind of irrelevant past low level
[0:25:01] <+kewlmyc> LET'S GO REGGIE
[0:25:04] <%someyounguy1> woolie with the GIMMICKS
[0:25:04] <pillowwasp> Also you can’t hit stun him

[0:25:15] <%AliveInside191> Does Woolie know how to KBD?
[0:25:17] <RcMacPanther22> Little Mac on Tekken. Heihachi confirmed for Smash ?
[0:25:18] <+ssulcer> I think that dragunov is finna down 2
[0:25:19] <BigNerdSam> man, remember when Mr X dropped Leon off that cliff while talking about how tigers drop their young off cliffs and only raise the strongest?
[0:25:20] <Second_Omega> KO Punch When?

[0:44:07] <WG101> @Menitta like a corpse?

[0:45:06] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> I mained yoshi in 3 and made my sisters quit video games by spamming his command grab
[0:45:10] <+TheObliviousAdobo> These Shennigans with Yoshi is why you don't see most players getting to a high level with him. Most Yoshi players don't learn proper fundamentals.

[1:07:23] <APB_Harleqyn> how do you know what is "safe"?
[1:07:32] <+countgaculatv> @zanzibar_junker I agree
[1:07:37] <ArtThouBored> Oh yeah I mained Tag 2 Kunimitsu
[1:07:53] <ArtThouBored> I miss her tho
[1:07:58] <+voynich_> safe in most instances is anything minus 9 on block or less
[1:07:59] <IsNotJesus> Safe moves are 0 to-9 on block
[1:08:16] <+Shastafield> poke
[1:08:16] <+voynich_> fastest moves are generally 10 frames
[1:08:17] <+countgaculatv> @APB_Harleqyn He has a general knowledge of frame data. Some attacks on block recover faster than pretty much all punishes
[1:08:31] <APB_Harleqyn> ty all!
[1:09:08] <Kathariya> reggie is the same guy that commentating for SFV right?
[1:09:22] <bulletblitz227> I jus realized they were in the corner XD
[1:09:31] <+zanzibar_junker> AK looks like a dark souls character
[1:09:45] <RyuuAoi> We in here!!
[1:09:46] <Kathariya> i might be wrong but i remember watch canada cup
[1:09:59] <%jinking79> Woolie have u created Rage/Black Heihachi in this game
[1:10:15] <jubejube56> but is there a reverse tombstone?
[1:10:17] <TheyCallMeVawn> Gotta pay attention to the hands
[1:10:17] <ArtThouBored> Is AK's Giant Swing just as threatening as King?
[1:10:23] <redlight55> kaz doesnt have a generic df1, hes mid poke is kinda df4. he also doesnt have a generic hopkick
[1:11:20] <Revant_tillywink> @ArtThouBored yep i think its the same move
[1:11:26] <ArtThouBored> Looking into adding AK to my list
[1:11:27] <jubejube56> 71 damage!
[1:11:31] <+zanzibar_junker> I do like the fact that kazuya just fully wields his devil powers
[1:11:35] <TheyCallMeVawn> Giant swing at the wall is ridiculous
[1:11:40] <%PlumpPotatoRump> ^
[1:11:43] <Kathariya> i don't know that LUL
[1:12:02] <ArtThouBored> The mash is important
[1:12:03] <iLikeChocoCake> all 2+4 throws side switches
[1:12:06] <+countgaculatv> Geez
[1:12:10] <IsNotJesus> @WoolieVersus Generic 2+4 throws all side switch
[1:12:11] <Revant_tillywink> @WoolieVersus turn off rage your getting inflated damage numbers
[1:12:16] <DeebzNutz100> 2 grab is usually side switch
[1:12:28] <Synchroscheme> damn, woolie playing tekken? sick.
[1:12:44] <$konekoryugamine> OH DANG
[1:12:56] <$konekoryugamine> Also, I saw some footage of Jump Force. WOW does it . . . look . . . interesting.
[1:13:03] <$konekoryugamine> I mean, that's all I can say on it.

[1:15:17] <+Shastafield> LUL
[1:15:19] <NinjaGentleman> Maybe Research Reggie
[1:15:21] <ManOfReason> man tekken combos feel so weird compared to 2d fighters
[1:15:26] <+Totally_not_toby> let's get some groundswell for Reggie Research
[1:15:28] <%UrsulaCat> reggiesearch
[1:15:37] <+Totally_not_toby> we gotta push it for summerslam
[1:15:55] <+jimbofletcher> y r tekken dlc characters so expensive?
[1:15:58] <%UrsulaCat> I knew a guy named reggie once when I was a teenager. he was cool
[1:16:00] <%AliveInside191> @ManOfReason Some MK players might feel at home, since they both use pre set strings
[1:16:11] <+zanzibar_junker> They should make anew mishima character 4 SC6
[1:16:26] <ArtThouBored> Yeah I kinda do with MK and Tekken
[1:16:49] <+voynich_> damn first try?

[1:20:52] <%PlumpPotatoRump> rikutoAsta rikutoAsta rikutoAsta
[1:21:00] <ManOfReason> @WoolieVersus Which do you think is more important for bringing in new players, sing-player content or easy to learn systems?
[1:21:06] <+Totally_not_toby> woolie did you see that jump force is now the single easiest game to mod
[1:21:06] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:21:09] <Laironx3> You should summon EyepatchWolf for Jump Force
[1:21:09] <cassidynaufahu> Show kaz combos
[1:21:14] <+jetjagger222> @woolieversus hey woolz, ever heard of change air blade? its a versus top-down shooter by arcsys
[1:21:23] <+l33t_j4gu4r> going to play soulcal7?
[1:21:28] <egggggggggggggggggggggg> @woolieversus how do you best take advantage of an attack or block stun that forces crouching?
[1:21:31] <Rojahh> @WoolieVersus Thoughts on MK11 roster leaks
[1:21:55] <cassidynaufahu> Where is this at
[1:22:00] <+Totally_not_toby> that might be podcast news but jump force's source files are included in the game so now it's the simplest, easiest, cleanest game to mod currently on the market
[1:22:02] <%DrPoxx> Is the speed of light too slow for Fighting Game pros?
[1:22:10] <fgiting> Jet upper is f,b2
[1:22:15] <%itsjustdoogan> @WoolieVersus much appreciated
[1:22:17] <fgiting> Not f,b1
[1:22:18] <baren817> How do you guys calm down under stressful situations in fighting games? Whether it's a huge losing streak or pressure? @WoolieVersus
[1:22:21] <Revant_tillywink> do an electric than do 4 more
[1:22:25] <Revant_tillywink> do it you coward
[1:22:47] <+Totally_not_toby> sorry project files
[1:22:52] <cassidynaufahu> Hold d f at the same time
[1:22:55] <%blazymaniac> @WoolieVersus im thinking of trying to learn either blazblue or guilty gear, is one easier to get into than the other?
[1:23:00] <cassidynaufahu> Then 1 r
[1:23:03] <+dj_berserk_ix> atpHarada atpMurray
[1:23:04] <cassidynaufahu> *4
[1:23:06] <+SirTerribleh> Of course Ginyu
[1:23:10] <+DarthPhallus30005> Fun teams
[1:23:13] <+generalve> Woolz sorry to bother you again but do you want me to resend the emote to you ?
[1:23:15] <tungstenviper> @woolieversus are you interested in DOA6 ?
[1:23:23] <+DarthPhallus30005> Hit is meta in season2
[1:23:24] <Krando> @blazymaniac i think blazblue is easier
[1:23:27] <+countgaculatv> @WoolieVersus I usually bounce between claw and regular on pad with Tekken. What's your preference? This is the only fighting game I play on pad btw.
[1:23:30] <+DarthPhallus30005> He beats new GC pretty clean
[1:23:33] <+Totally_not_toby> @WoolieVersus do you have any advice for someone who only plays smash who wants to get into fighting games?
[1:24:02] <+gael_jebidibah> Ideally both
[1:24:08] <gottigotbundles> money match pat in tetris
[1:24:11] <@Solidus_113> how easy is it to transfer skills between fighters with 3, 4, or 6 buttons?
[1:24:23] <cassidynaufahu> After df 1 4 do b 1 4 2
[1:24:29] <%Ir0nAgr0> Just got into fighting games last year thanks to SBF and my first fighting game BBtag, put over 350 hours since launch. Do you think you'll be playing it on here?
[1:24:43] <cassidynaufahu> *back 2
[1:24:45] <TheNewJapanGuy> I love how AK is just Great Muta ^!
[1:24:50] <+zanzibar_junker> More f2p models
[1:24:51] <deafmelone> All fighting games need arcade modes
[1:25:02] <MickeyMoore13> ^
[1:25:04] <cassidynaufahu> *back 2 4 1
[1:25:05] <baren817> @WoolieVersus Any tips on getting into 2d fighters? I'm thinking about getting into DBFZ and I've been super comfortable play 3d fighters like Tekken and Soul Calibur
[1:25:06] <deafmelone> just to ease back into it
[1:25:19] <Revant_tillywink> reggie you have to clear some ground with the hellsweep
[1:25:26] <gottigotbundles> with rival fights like old. tekkens and endings
[1:25:41] <redlight55> kaz beginner gameplan: mixup wd to hellsweep or wd to ws2 / f4
[1:25:44] <prime_name> @WoolieVersus Any chances of seeing a Geese tonight?
[1:25:44] <+zanzibar_junker> Arcade mode and handful characters 4 free
[1:25:48] <Revant_tillywink> you can take a whole step before doing the move
[1:25:55] <%Wonderbot3000> @woolieversus why are fighting games on pc so unpopulated
[1:26:43] <Sorubr0> T7 is the FG of the decade
[1:26:51] <egggggggggggggggggggggg> Thanks guys! Much appreciated
[1:27:01] <+countgaculatv> I can answer that, it's cuz it's cheaper for tournament set up and cheaper to own with a preset console
[1:27:11] <iforgottousername> @WoolieVersus Kotal is configrmed by steam leaks
[1:27:16] <DeebzNutz100> War Gods
[1:27:20] <%Ir0nAgr0> How much time should Iput into labing new moves vs trying them in actual matches?
[1:27:25] <ArtThouBored> Kotal was the best
[1:27:46] <MickeyMoore13> I'm just happy ma Black Dragon bois are back
[1:27:48] <Krando> T7 is the only FG i've fully enjoyed, tried SC6, SFV is meh and aesthetics is trash, DBFZ tag fighters feels frustrating to play against other folks
[1:27:56] <nothuzad> I hate the way MK games animate and the block button it just feels so jerky to me
[1:27:59] <Krando> dick jab isn't needed
[1:27:59] <ArtThouBored> "Taste the blade of Osh-Tekk!"
[1:28:09] <Sorubr0> the thing is T7 feels so polished
[1:28:09] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:28:10] <nothuzad> but to each their own :)
[1:28:24] <nothuzad> well T7 was in arcades for ever V:
[1:28:27] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Smash is a fighting game
[1:28:32] <Deadpool2450> Kotal Ogre/ Ogre Khan. At least Kotal didn't transform into some weird Cronenberg God of War monster
[1:28:42] <+SirTerribleh> Smash isn't a video game
[1:28:44] <$cureneckbeard> Woolie! Where's the horse penis? Pat insists he hasn't got it
[1:28:45] <+Harawanagangsta> Do you have the Horse Penis from the Mailbag episode?
[1:28:48] <+Pleasant21> Who took the horse penis?
[1:28:56] <o0bscure> Where's the horse cock, Woolie?
[1:28:58] <DomunDomunDomun> @WoolieVersus Pat wants to know who took the horse dildo.
[1:29:01] <+SuperChumps> Where is the horse penis woolie?
[1:29:05] <sosuke5> Wheres the horse penis, Woolie?

[1:29:29] <Keeble24> Woolie HORSE PENIS
[1:29:31] <+Harawanagangsta> that sounds like something Pat would say
[1:29:46] <flagi64> someone asked in his stream and he said ask woolie
[1:29:47] <+dawsfloss> pat is infecting chat
[1:29:55] <+koriethecoward> im sorry woolie
[1:29:58] <DeadlyRaveNeo> yoooooooo
[1:30:08] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Yeah but Pat would throw in an obscure word or term to prove his point
[1:30:14] <DSD24> @WoolieVersus Will you play Soul Calibur 6 on stream in the future?
[1:30:18] <Keeble24> Where's the horse penis?
[1:30:29] <+SuperChumps> where is the horse dildo woolie????
[1:30:39] <+dawsfloss> matt apparently took the penis
[1:30:48] <flagi64> @RAAAAAINMAKER you arent wrong
[1:31:00] <reokie_t7> DBFZ is fun but I prefer games with a more chill nutural game
[1:31:30] <%jinking79> wait where is this horse penis coming from
[1:31:32] <Synchroscheme> that's why KBD is so important
[1:31:45] <+koriethecoward> mailbag
[1:31:48] <+koriethecoward> way back
[1:31:50] <+Heroes_of_Vale> Someone in chat brought it up on Pat's stream a few minutes ago
[1:32:01] <flagi64> Miss that mailbag
[1:32:01] <Keeble24> blame the angry red ginger in his stream
[1:32:18] <flagi64> mailbag had some great moments
[1:32:28] <ArtThouBored> And Noctis stage is small too
[1:32:30] <%Wool> What is the best way to have accessible information during tournaments? i.e. bracket, times, delays, etc.
[1:32:31] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Don't exact want to piss those guys off
[1:32:36] <+koriethecoward> had woolie fighting it
[1:32:46] <+generalve> LUL
[1:33:20] <IsNotJesus> damn, he's got a pretty good KBD
[1:33:27] <%CaptainPileDriver> woolie, my bob is ready
[1:33:41] <hayley0wns> woolie sandbagged the dildo crowd so hard
[1:33:51] <%CaptainPileDriver> THIS ONE IS LESS CREEPY
[1:34:00] <DSD24> Can't way to play Lei Fang again in DOA6
[1:34:06] <luzoc> Is there still a block button in MK 11?
[1:34:07] <%CaptainPileDriver> i'd say guilty gear feels a bit less stuff
[1:34:08] <nothuzad> also Guilty gear has great learning tools
[1:34:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> *stiff
[1:34:11] <nothuzad> not teh best but good
[1:34:11] <ArtThouBored> Or Yoshi heals and I force you to come to me Kappa
[1:34:26] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> BlazBlue is Mike Ross' SFV anti-venom
[1:34:31] <+generalve> @WoolieVersus Im Sorry to bother you again but if you lost the emote i sent ill be happy to send it again through msg or donation
[1:34:33] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> So it must be good
[1:34:56] <DeadlyRaveNeo> we must fight
[1:35:11] <ManOfReason> Theres a Boomers by my school that has a tekken 5 cabinet, but the joysticks on it are so janky lol
[1:35:12] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:35:12] <DREAM_BISON> why were shoulder buttons banned?
[1:35:19] <DeadlyRaveNeo> binded buttons suck
[1:35:20] <Kathariya> guilty gear/blazblue got the best music of all the fgc FIGHT ME!
[1:35:21] <%CaptainPileDriver> so, when you ready to get blown up on stream
[1:35:22] <deafmelone> Ive been playing thumb since 31st
[1:35:36] <DeadlyRaveNeo> i play smash on a stick
[1:35:46] <ArtThouBored> Button Mapping is simpler
[1:35:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> leffen plays high level dragon ball so i don't think it's to different
[1:35:58] <+Totally_not_toby> lol thanks. most of my fighting game friends just tell me to stop jumping
[1:36:02] <+spiritloll> i think its easier to go from smash to 3D fighters tbh
[1:36:08] <%krispen_wa> I don't think anyone would fight you on the fact that Arksys games have the best music
[1:36:27] <spawnzombie> Tbf its not like they have any competition nowadays
[1:36:29] <@Solidus_113> woolieREMEMBERS
[1:36:30] <nothuzad> msot fighting games are like boxing - smash is kinda like sumo
[1:36:33] <$LuisKingKing> I suck at fighting games but I love them so much and I buy every new one and still suck and of course i want to get better but I love playing so many different games but I don’t get better and I wonder do i need to just stick to one game or can I carry fundamentals into every game?
[1:36:43] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @DeadlyRaveNeo
[1:37:04] <ManOfReason> Yeah, that the hardest thing coming from smash. jump ins are so strong that it becomes a habit in traditional fighters
[1:37:10] <Kathariya> i feel like smash should be it own genre so people stop bitching about it not a fighting game
[1:37:26] <DeadlyRaveNeo> can smash be played on a fight stick
[1:37:33] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> There are fundamentals in fighting games that def transfer, blocking, spacing, pressure and punishing are universal
[1:37:33] <Kathariya> with many smash clone and all
[1:37:52] <+l33t_j4gu4r> what do u think are the main differences between 2d and 3d fighters?
[1:37:53] <+nutgoth> Thats no ttrue at all
[1:38:00] <reokie_t7> Platform Fighters are a thing
[1:38:01] <reiju_22> are they?
[1:38:01] <nothuzad> pc communities hav ebeen getting bigger - most games just didnt release on pc
[1:38:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> they want the hardware
[1:38:16] <SacredDeity> @CaptainPileDriver dbfz wasnt completely new to leffen, he played umvc3
[1:38:22] <@Menitta> @WoolieVersus What game would you recommend for getting into 3D fighters as someone used to 2D? I'm good at Pokken but terrible with everything else
[1:38:34] <+spiritloll> PC is you trade less delay for longer queue times
[1:38:35] <nothuzad> most fgs didnt release on pc and its mostly not tourney standard - but the communitie shave been getting bigger
[1:38:42] <ArtThouBored> I'd to love to fight with you guys but I have a wifi problem I cant fix
[1:39:00] <ArtThouBored> Sorry
[1:39:02] <BlueKaixa> I'd love to but no PSNsub
[1:39:20] <@Menitta> Rip lines
[1:39:24] <spawnzombie> PS Plus is kind of a scam otherwise I'd hop on the PS4
[1:39:33] <i_love_thicc_chicks> I don't have Tekken 7.
[1:39:41] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> I love on the otherside of the World so I'll just criticize with my pet dingo
[1:39:45] <+jetjagger222> KUZE
[1:39:46] <reiju_22> @Menitta soulcalibur is much easier than tekken
[1:39:47] <+jordy_j_s> Haven't seen Noctis at all so would love to see him
[1:39:49] <+Answer_Moose> So I know nothing of tekken, what's that bears name
[1:39:50] <@Solidus_113> I wanna see some KUMA!
[1:39:52] <redlight55> play marduk

[1:40:11] <%PlumpPotatoRump> @isnotjesus saaaammme
[1:40:12] <%CaptainPileDriver> PANDA
[1:40:12] <@Menitta> SC6 seemed more intuitive
[1:40:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> IT WAS PANDA
[1:40:19] <Rygart121> PANDA
[1:40:23] <Kathariya> IT PANDA
[1:40:26] <+supahrob64> PANDA YOU FOOL
[1:40:34] <ArtThouBored> SC6 has better movement
[1:40:35] <MickeyMoore13> MA BOI Fury
[1:40:38] <%ChoculaUltra> jet upper inc.
[1:40:39] <%PlumpPotatoRump> that was a really good laufh
[1:40:39] <reokie_t7> @spawnzombie this is why i dont have a ps4, like i already paid for internet NotLikeThis
[1:40:42] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> I predict you'll eat 4 Snake Edges
[1:40:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> panda cause there are some differences between kuma and panda
[1:40:49] <stealthfart> I thought there was a conversation about not streaming at the same time. Woolie taking risks. Also, show me that Armor King tech.

[1:42:20] <gottigotbundles> he allows invites
[1:42:26] <+generalve> how do you avoid kings grabs ?
[1:42:26] <reokie_t7> SC6 has more to do for new fg players and has a much much easier movement system
[1:42:30] <frydchikin_> !MOTIVATED
[1:42:30] <@Moobot> 90 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[1:42:39] <Kathariya> suplex city bitch!

[1:42:58] <theneosloth> for king he does have some true 50/50 mixups with the grabs but you can usually predict what grab they're gonna use depending on where you are
[1:43:03] <+Answer_Moose> oof
[1:43:04] <razielhex> Man, Bryan Fury had a hell of an evolution to Cowboy Skeletor Luchador Construction Worker
[1:43:05] <i_love_thicc_chicks> @itsjustdoogan INDEED
[1:43:05] <theneosloth> and you can duck them obviously
[1:43:06] <reokie_t7> And the customization system in SC is way better than T7s

[1:47:56] <ManOfReason> @woolieversus does it seem hard to visually read check moves in tekken?
[1:47:57] <deafmelone> how do i find this session
[1:48:02] <+countgaculatv> @itsjustdoogan The facial and body animations are bad. Like ugly bad.

[1:48:32] <%UrsulaCat> R E G G I E L O R E
[1:48:38] <ArtThouBored> Him in Jump Force vs Pokken Mewtwo in a battle for a towel
[1:48:39] <+countgaculatv> At least Xenoverse was laughably bad, Jump Force looks ugly when you look at it longer than a minute
[1:48:40] <@Solidus_113> just waiting for Joker to release
[1:48:40] <%CaptainPileDriver> can't wait for smash ultimate stream
[1:48:41] <%UrsulaCat> 20008?

[1:50:28] <MickeyMoore13> Speaking of music, what's the best soundtrack from any Tekken?
[1:50:31] <APB_Harleqyn> Yo - but where is that Snoop Dog Tekken song??? :P
[1:50:34] <ArtThouBored> I mean Jin
[1:50:34] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Moonlit Wilderness for all stage and menu music
[1:50:36] <%Rezca> Why doesn't the PC version have it?
[1:50:36] <%CaptainPileDriver> give panda your energy
[1:50:42] <razielhex> @nohat1375 Friday Night Fisticuffs
[1:50:45] <dking0000> PC doesn’t have the Tekken 4 Jin costume and that makes it literally unplayable

[1:51:03] <ArtThouBored> @MickeyMoore13 Tekken Tag 1, Tekken 5, Tekken 3 and Tekken 4

[1:55:48] <DSD24> Her design is cool but I hate crying fighting characters

[2:12:21] <ArtThouBored> b2 is amazing in Tag 2
[2:12:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> So when's Alex coming back to tekken?
[2:12:27] <DSD24> Man this Armor King costume is cool
[2:12:39] <IsNotJesus> Bob's worse than he was in T6/TTT2 but he's still pretty decent? I haven't seen any tournament presence from him

[2:15:27] <+TheObliviousAdobo> @WoolieVersus Yoshi's aggression is super risky so can just let them kill themselves usually.

[2:18:44] <+supahrob64> !geese1
[2:18:47] <%PlumpPotatoRump> yh i played once already
[2:18:52] <APB_Harleqyn> How hard is Geese to learn as a newcomer?
[2:18:53] <%PlumpPotatoRump> i was the chloe
[2:18:54] <%burgersama_dlx> seeing a kof character lookin' this nice in 3d
[2:19:01] <@Solidus_113> this isn't saltybet woolieREMEMBERS
[2:19:04] <ArtThouBored> I was the stupid gimmicky Yoshimitsu lol
[2:19:06] <$konekoryugamine> I'm jumping between this and Shofu playing Jump Force. It's . . . still interesting.
[2:19:07] <+Answer_Moose> So is Geese really just a big weeb?

[2:19:34] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Gladio is best girl in FF15
[2:19:36] <@Menitta> Whens getting into fighting games Saltybet Kappa
[2:19:36] <+Answer_Moose> @MickeyMoore13 you right
[2:19:37] <Wofoeh> Lei to me is like a Yoshi, on the right hands he’s TERRIFYING
[2:19:38] <$konekoryugamine> Hie hair looks like Gumby was melted and then reformed before being left out to dry for punishment
[2:19:44] <razielhex> Dong Dong Never Die! has both a Bruce Lee & Jackie Chan
[2:19:45] <+TheObliviousAdobo> @WoolieVersus Lei is extremely weak against 2D characters due to projectiles having the ability to force him out of stance.
[2:19:52] <Sorubr0> Jump Force is garbo
[2:19:55] <baren817> That Ha Ha step
[2:19:56] <ArtThouBored> When I play Yoshi you have to force me to think and strategize i
[2:20:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> it is
[2:20:12] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's the pretzel motion
[2:20:13] <$konekoryugamine> I'm not gonna jump, that's the mind game!
[2:20:24] <KeiPrime> yeah pretzel is in this one
[2:20:24] <%laserbeaming> It is the pretzel, it's what keeps me from playing geese
[2:20:30] <harris2210> Damn haha step
[2:20:32] <KeiPrime> its NOT pretzel in kof14 which is confusing
[2:20:33] <DeebzNutz100> 3 bars isnt it?
[2:20:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's also 3 bars
[2:20:58] <redlight55> its pretzel, needs full bar
[2:21:10] <ArtThouBored> I got big excited and went ham
[2:21:11] <%CaptainPileDriver> now pretzel motion
[2:21:11] <+Answer_Moose> THAT'S PROMPTO
[2:21:21] <MickeyMoore13> Prompto is a human Chocobo
[2:21:23] <+Answer_Moose> Also a chocobo
[2:21:23] <redlight55> pretzel is very lenient
[2:21:26] <Wofoeh> @laserbeaming if you land it once you can land it consistently
[2:21:27] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> It's both
[2:21:27] <ArtThouBored> Did they get lag on their end when I played Yoshimitsu?
[2:21:28] <%PlumpPotatoRump> prompto, chokobo the same thing reAlly

[2:22:48] <+Omegasinnocence> I just call it red shit and blue shit
[2:22:50] <Guntanks_in_Space> it's faster for shorthand
[2:23:06] <ArtThouBored> Oddly enough X-Rays in MK are used before Supers
[2:23:07] <+jetjagger222> jim kazama

[2:26:08] <357Sneak> no
[2:26:09] <ArtThouBored> No Armor King was in Tag 1
[2:26:14] <harris2210> No
[2:26:17] <petpurplepanda> Tag 1
[2:26:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> yes
[2:26:29] <kaine_west> Use Rage Drives for plus frames Wools
[2:26:35] <SkewerSTARSTREAM> SPD! SPD! SPD! SPD!
[2:26:41] <Guntanks_in_Space> technically AMK was in Tekken 3 only in the endings, where he DIED
[2:26:44] <%CaptainPileDriver> he was technically dead until the drunk brother took on the mantle
[2:26:47] <+TheObliviousAdobo> He was in Tekken 5 DR onward for canon main games.
[2:26:52] <%PlumpPotatoRump> in tekken 1 he was a heihachi clone. thats why he hs dark upper xS
[2:26:54] <ArtThouBored> That is true he was in Tekken endings
[2:26:58] <Kenny_Riot> Only Mexicans die in Tekken
[2:27:02] <harris2210> Tekken 3 king 2 wears aka mask as a homage

[2:27:38] <ArtThouBored> Armor King 1 was killed by Marduk, King 1 was killed by Ancient Ogre
[2:27:42] <kaine_west> use the grab mix-ups you're AK Woolie
[2:27:43] <SkewerSTARSTREAM> @kaine_west AK's Rage drive is kinda finnicky to use though... unless Woolie's good at CDs.
[2:27:46] <+TheObliviousAdobo> I played Tekken 5 but never DR so I was super confused to hear AK was in Tekken 5 for a time.
[2:27:51] <kaine_west> it's part of his game plan

[2:31:49] <@Solidus_113> !uptime
[2:31:49] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 31 minutes
[2:31:49] <Kenny_Riot> Woolie, Tekken is the best music in Fighting Games, period.
[2:31:54] <+jetjagger222> T5/DR best overall
[2:31:55] <Guntanks_in_Space> Tekken 7.... eeeh i'm not feeling the OST as much compared to the older games
[2:31:59] <+TheObliviousAdobo> G corp Night feels like the one mistake Tekken 7 made though
[2:32:02] <stropbopadopolis> tag 2 or 5 best soundtrack
[2:32:04] <Guntanks_in_Space> not entirely, but 7 still has some good ones
[2:32:04] <KeiPrime> yeah but 7's music,... yeesh
[2:32:09] <+jetjagger222> 3rd round on this has to be DR OST
[2:32:10] <%supaXmugen> Killer Instinct
[2:32:12] <Guntanks_in_Space> @TheObliviousAdobo YES THAT ONE
[2:32:18] <Guntanks_in_Space> that one song sours the OST
[2:32:20] <kaine_west> hellsweep Reggie
[2:32:21] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> No, Ryu's headband was a gify fro Ken, that's just a Tekken headgear
[2:32:23] <%UrsulaCat> MENI MENI MENI
[2:32:26] <%supaXmugen> Also Tekken 3s Gon music
[2:32:27] <kaine_west> it's a noob killer
[2:32:35] <MickeyMoore13> @WoolieVersus what's your personal favorite Tekken for music? Not just any song but whole OST in general
[2:32:42] <+Answer_Moose> So I've been wondering this, why does it seem to be so bright in Woolies room there. Is that just the brightness of his TV?
[2:32:43] <@Solidus_113> you... did it
[2:32:46] <kaine_west> good job

[2:33:15] <+TheObliviousAdobo> @Guntanks_in_Space It's not even an objectively bad song but the issue is when playing a game is you have to keep listening to it. That's not the kind of music most people can handle listening to for too long.

[2:40:33] <kaine_west> woolie do RD, it's just DP motions
[2:40:41] <prime_name> Wasn't he too hot and got kicked out of his state?
[2:40:43] <tacostarvedbeast> inflict a beating upon your person, thats a pretty legit thing to say imo

[2:40:55] <Guntanks_in_Space> @prime_name that was just a hoax, but it's still so funny lol
[2:40:56] <ARBITERWARPIG> Shaheen is the guy who was kicked out of Saudi Arabia for being too handsome.
[2:40:58] <%OmegaWeltall> huh, i learned something SeemsGood
[2:41:01] <+jetjagger222> shaheen can do a pretty decent adam jensen customization

[2:42:20] <@Menitta> If you're gonna make a joseph joestar, you gotta use Heihachi since they share voice actors
[2:42:22] <Fluke_M> @Answer_Moose It means they're in Rage, so they do more damage, but you can activate Rage Drive/Rage Art and sacrifice that state

[2:59:51] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 3 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 12oz (360mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.

[3:01:38] <+Answer_Moose> Vaguely
[3:01:50] <@Solidus_113> my local mall had a wall full of them for like $120 each
[3:02:03] <+jetjagger222> 120 USD?
[3:02:04] <+ItsCarsonBluh> ew
[3:02:07] <+Answer_Moose> Shit every brand had bootleg things of it though.
[3:02:09] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @jetjagger222 you mean the ones YoVideogames wears for Anime Saturdays?
[3:02:11] <@Solidus_113> 120 cdn

[3:02:39] <+ItsCarsonBluh> still disgusting
[3:02:42] <@Solidus_113> back in... 2006?
[3:02:42] <%KingLlama1> @UrsulaCat about tree fiddy
[3:02:43] <+zanzibar_junker> Hope more RE2 this Saturday
[3:02:56] <+Answer_Moose> I still can't pick which of these shirts are the cringiest.
[3:03:02] <%UrsulaCat> haha your money is a joke
[3:03:15] <@Menitta> does this work? I hope this works
[3:03:18] <%KingLlama1> it smells like maple syrup though !!!
[3:03:20] <@Menitta> !game Rising Thunder
[3:03:21] <@Moobot> The category was set to "Rising Thunder"
[3:03:25] <@Menitta> sick
[3:03:31] <+ItsCarsonBluh> bruh, thje shirt with the main character from sao. it says "recardless"
[3:03:35] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @Answer_Moose to me it's the protection, respect, show no mercy one
[3:03:44] <jamaicanboy0209> has stream started?
[3:04:21] <@Menitta> ok there it goes
[3:04:21] <+Answer_Moose> @Admiral_PopnFresh I think it's the special kind of twisted one for me. But all of these seem to have a fedora requirement attached to them
[3:04:46] <%Fiend95> So what happened to Rising Thunder ever since Riot bought it?
[3:04:59] <@Menitta> it became open source
[3:05:02] <+gessho> What are these awfiul shirts
[3:05:12] <+ItsCarsonBluh> i kinda like the pain shirt
[3:05:12] <@Solidus_113> YEYEYEYEYEEE
[3:05:14] <%itsjustdoogan> wb
[3:05:40] <+Answer_Moose> @gessho They're real I think, and you can probably get them at your local Hot Topic.
[3:05:41] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @Answer_Moose not suave enough for Fedora, I think a military beret feels more apt for someone wanting to exude an "attitude"
[3:05:46] <+Artdog_01> God Rugal or Sol Badguy would be nice in Tekken too as a fighting guest mecha
[3:06:14] <+gessho> oh it's clear they're real just wondering who would unironically wear them @Answer_Moose
[3:06:31] <@Solidus_113> Rising Thunder has no motions, attacks are based on distance and directions
[3:06:38] <+Answer_Moose> @gessho Anyone that regularly wears a fedora.
[3:06:59] <+Answer_Moose> @gessho They might also be a bronie
[3:06:59] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:07:12] <+gessho> Gross
[3:07:15] <Recthel> those people are wrong

[3:07:24] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Which I don't get, robots are awesome
[3:07:26] <+jetjagger222> yes, they're called philistines
[3:07:37] <reiju_22> LUL
[3:07:38] <%OmegaWeltall> yea realy, i like robots
[3:07:46] <+WhyIDie> one must fall SwiftRage
[3:07:52] <@Menitta> depends on the design imo
[3:07:55] <Laironx3> I relate to robutts MrDestructoid
[3:07:57] <%KingLlama1> waifus > robots > man men
[3:07:58] <Admiral_PopnFresh> If you have a shooter game, it becomes vastly more interesting for it to be robots shooting than people
[3:08:10] <+Answer_Moose> Is Jensen a robot or a human at this point.
[3:08:15] <%Solidnick18> i love robutts
[3:08:15] <Bionicghost> hey guys, remember Turbo Teen?
[3:08:26] <Guntanks_in_Space> it goddamn din
[3:08:32] <Kathariya> KOF still big in mexico LUL
[3:08:32] <Admiral_PopnFresh> like MvCi?
[3:08:35] <@Menitta> KOF14 got a lighting update not too long ago and it looks way better
[3:08:45] <jubejube56> anybody who is interested in Rising Thunder should definetly check out the discord
[3:08:47] <Guntanks_in_Space> did**, and hell it ain't even Simple 2000. Eventually it was last gen at worst lol
[3:08:51] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @Kathariya Latin America will always keep KOF alive
[3:08:59] <+sentaiStriker> Yeah, KOF's update was great
[3:09:05] <+sentaiStriker> I hope the series keeps going
[3:09:05] <Guntanks_in_Space> people trashed KOF XIV without even playing it and it kinda hurts lol
[3:09:05] <Bionicghost> if you don't know about turbo teen, google it. N O W
[3:09:15] <+Nomicro4u> Jigger please
[3:09:17] <+WhyIDie> if KoF ever dies in mexico, the series will officially be dead
[3:09:24] <Guntanks_in_Space> also it's cool that RT somehow lives via community

[3:22:02] <+bizzer10> Do you ever play Smash? This game looks cool tho.
[3:22:03] <Quikanims> I see people compare this game to sf4 but it seems much faster
[3:22:24] <razielhex> TTK is much lower

[3:24:28] <razielhex> is that last robot embedded with the glorious red star of the proletariat?
[3:24:46] <Triplicat> remember that time the audio cut out on a tournament stream and Yipes/Lee Chung did a capella SFX
[3:24:59] <Triplicat> that was definitely SF5
[3:25:09] <BeNiceImShy> I guess that's the benefit of there being no top players
[3:25:20] <Guntanks_in_Space> oh man they adlibbed even the hit and crush counter noises lol
[3:25:31] <jubejube56> lol there are still top players just no scene for them to shine
[3:25:33] <+GunterDriger6> Bro!
[3:25:40] <Triplicat> @Guntanks_in_Space SeemsGood
[3:25:47] <Triplicat> CLING A LING A LING

[3:26:23] <$LuisKingKing> Play some of that royalty free spongebob ukulele music
[3:26:49] <razielhex> 9 times this round, he was hit with a crouching low kick
[3:26:57] <%JackalopeHerd> I really miss this game
[3:27:05] <Guntanks_in_Space> hell, KOF's Reynald was good at this too
[3:27:36] <jubejube56> crow jumping M cancels into jumping special 2
[3:27:42] <Triplicat> oh yeah

[3:27:47] <Triplicat> slicuu loops
[3:27:56] <Guntanks_in_Space> oh god the slice-u loops
[3:28:01] <jubejube56> lol yeah I know a few crows with stupid loops
[3:28:02] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:28:15] <Guntanks_in_Space> i expect Talos boot into EBROS
[3:28:17] <razielhex> Where's my hydrationbot update?
[3:28:36] <DeathByPoke7> GET THE DRINKS READY
[3:28:57] <donkey_b1tchass> !MOTIVATED
[3:28:57] <@Moobot> 94 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[3:28:57] <jubejube56> and then talos had his charge grab 50/50s
[3:29:07] <+Superkbrown95> This game actually looks super exciting, i wish there was some sort of demo
[3:29:11] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Okay, it's really cheesy, but you know what sound track is really good for this? Gunpla Build Fighters ost
[3:29:16] <+Sinoc229> there is
[3:29:25] <$LuisKingKing> It’s a shame what happened to this game
[3:29:26] <ArtThouBored> Well I got work tomorrow morning so I'll see you folks later
[3:30:00] <jubejube56> lol well there is a version with a training mode, online, and local versus but you won't find too many people playing. Sort of a better demo
[3:30:03] <+Superkbrown95> Have a nice night @artthoubored
[3:30:03] <ArtThouBored> Good games to all
[3:30:34] <+SimplesRock> Yay! I made it home for the fighter stream!
[3:30:56] <DeathByPoke7> you can advanced cancel the throws too
[3:31:00] <+Superkbrown95> Ooohh, i totally though this was Metal Revolution, whoops :p
[3:31:27] <jubejube56> riposte, you armour an attack and enter an auto dash, you can also jump straight up out ofit
[3:31:45] <Datwiseguy> netplay when?
[3:31:49] <Guntanks_in_Space> must be nice trying to remember the Edge chains into slide wall bounce
[3:31:55] <+WhyIDie> doesn't hurt to flex a little every now and then
[3:31:56] <+damnitmcgarnicle> So what fighting games do they play weekly?
[3:32:04] <Datwiseguy> he has a manual charge
[3:32:06] <Datwiseguy> no attk
[3:32:20] <jubejube56> @Datwiseguy netplay exists but not many people playing
[3:32:23] <Datwiseguy> counter hasno actual attk i think
[3:32:24] <Guntanks_in_Space> @damnitmcgarnicle they change every other week
[3:32:32] <Datwiseguy> juri sf4 coutner
[3:32:37] <Guntanks_in_Space> also that DP should be multi-part
[3:32:56] <Datwiseguy> so every special 1 charge upgrades your special 2 with edge
[3:32:57] <+damnitmcgarnicle> Bummer. ill never be ready
[3:33:00] <Guntanks_in_Space> i know mashing on DP has follow-ups, and there's a second part to the single slash
[3:33:06] <DeathByPoke7> special 1 generates charges for special 2
[3:33:10] <Guntanks_in_Space> but you need to build up his meter
[3:33:34] <Datwiseguy> oh look, my favorite blender
[3:33:38] <jubejube56> special 3.3 causes wall bounce, special 1 variant 2 is the combo special on edge
[3:33:46] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Brad is the shit! pobeda!
[3:33:57] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Vlad*
[3:34:03] <%UrsulaCat> laika comrade hero dog

[3:34:15] <+WhyIDie> puppy popoffs
[3:34:32] <Guntanks_in_Space> also you can airdash/fly with Vlad don't forget
[3:34:44] <jubejube56> there is actually a story sort of
[3:34:44] <Guntanks_in_Space> though you gotta pay attention to his fuel gauge lol
[3:34:47] <@Solidus_113> woolieYE

[3:46:15] <BillieNoMates> This is why Greece is broke, Making swole bots for fighting competitions
[3:46:17] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Mexico kinda makes sense whe you think of the KOF scene, but Brazil is usually the Latin American Country of choice for fighting games

[4:05:52] <TheBrunoZone> Oh, hey, Core-A Gaming
[4:06:05] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @Kathariya Developer support stopped, essentially it was put out as an incomplete build and just played by a small community
[4:06:18] <jubejube56> variant 3.2 pushes the opponent full screen for zoning
[4:06:56] <UltraComboSupremeVictory> all I remember is that one guy rage quitting so hard from losing to chell he deleted his partnered twitch account LUL

[4:09:25] <Matthew_Sheridan> The energy effects are so nice.
[4:09:30] <jubejube56> RT was successful, its just the company got bought out
[4:09:31] <%PlumpPotatoRump> ^
[4:09:44] <Datwiseguy> it was less not successful, it was more bought out before it was out of alpha
[4:09:51] <Datwiseguy> damn beat me to it lol
[4:09:53] <jubejube56> I think the energy effects were one of the changes the devs made for the community edition too

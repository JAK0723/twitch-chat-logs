[0:26:38] <Sllypper> Would you like to activate Easy Mode?
[0:26:42] <subjectg> rip the 1cc dream
[0:26:49] <+Lunarthewolf> @Shikari21 that's how I feel, I've tried to play this game and my brain just can't deal
[0:26:51] <slyarvicle08> in which console version do you recommend playing ikaruga? @WoolieVersus
[0:26:56] <Truxton_II> It's Treasure's Skyrim. Prove me wrong.
[0:27:00] <$cureneckbeard> Ikaruga is a masterpiece.
[0:27:01] <kaine_west> I'm a believer now, this shits hype
[0:27:04] <jackiedan> stay white!
[0:27:04] <%Rawklobstah88> I wish my brain could operate this game. I can barely handle basic execution in DBFZ, KI, and UNIST
[0:27:07] <%Nmiser> woolieGASM
[0:27:20] <+DevinMayCry> Buy it on Switch and PC at minimum Because why not. Treasure deserves it
[0:27:21] <WG101> NO REFUGE
[0:27:25] <hassanico> If your brain can't handle this just wait till the final boss
[0:27:28] <$cureneckbeard> SOME REFUGE

[0:27:38] <dukenux> Is Steam version alright?

[0:28:05] <KappaKeepo42069> @DevinMayCry At least you can play all genres. No need to stress over being "the best" at some bloody games but not everybody can be flexible in the games they play
[0:28:09] <Admiral_PopnFresh> man, it's lie shmup meets rhythm game
[0:28:13] <Heracross9657> @woolieversus Will You Play Some Kirby After Ikaruga?

[0:28:30] <Truxton_II> @DevinMayCry Me too, but I don't think 3 will happen because Treasure hasn't made a new game since Gaist Crusher killed them
[0:28:33] <StrangeCoincidence> C is passing

[0:29:44] <anAngryHamster> CRAZY TALK
[0:29:49] <+DevinMayCry> @Truxton_II Cygames is pushing to make ZOE3, miracles can happen in life. Id gladly love a port because SaP2 on Switch would do real well I bet.
[0:29:53] <KappaKeepo42069> @gameaholic42 you get used to it, it gets you less anxious when you play than when you watch
[0:29:55] <+PersonaQueen18> Bullet hell games are legitimately terrifying.
[0:29:56] <+OmegaWeltall> god i love this fucking game Kreygasm
[0:30:07] <+PersonaQueen18> I can barely play Enter The Gungeon how's anyone manage this
[0:30:09] <ScreamingMeat> Crazy Talk is Pat's stand

[0:30:18] <digitaldenam> @WoolieVersus so, when's dodonpachi?
[0:30:24] <UrsulaCat> @WoolieVersus screw kirby after ikaruga play the h-game
[0:30:27] <Addamelech> Danmaku games are almost a zen experience
[0:30:29] <+deathbyace> crazy part of this game is that your hitbox is wayyy smaller than your shit
[0:30:30] <Idon__> LASERS
[0:30:31] <+deathbyace> ship
[0:30:35] <%PoopyDickens> @PersonaQueen18 this was way easier than enter the gungeon imho

[0:32:02] <NonAddictiveSlurm> the best shmups make the player's hurtbox a single pixel size, we need to remember that

[0:32:44] <Addamelech> I usually play 2hu on lunatic so I'd love to play this
[0:32:48] <%PoopyDickens> my ass is clenching from ptsd just watching rn
[0:32:48] <+KyroDragon> yo this game is fucked up
[0:32:49] <Theonlypegsus> @WoolieVersus I played this with my Brother all the time. He was alright at it but I died most the time. Thanks to this though.
[0:32:50] <Superdandy96> Yeah, totally, got to lvl 100 the other day an all(loudly sweats cause I clearly don’t understand what’s going on.)
[0:32:51] <Archangel317> I’ve never actually seen this game before today
[0:32:52] <HefestoForges> !uptime
[0:32:53] <Addamelech> looks tight
[0:32:53] <%homelesstwinky> this music is great
[0:32:56] <teflonbilly777> I got Ikaruga on Dreamcast, Gamecube, 360 and PC, yet I've never finished it. I am a fraud
[0:32:58] <StrangeCoincidence> jesus, this boss
[0:33:00] <Idon__> I how do you even DEAL with this
[0:33:08] <+OmegaWeltall> you learn
[0:33:09] <+KyroDragon> MORTIS
[0:33:09] <StrangeCoincidence> STOP
[0:33:10] <WG101> and then you just beef it
[0:33:12] <%arcturusblade> stage 3 is where the gloves come off, then stage 4 just says "fuck your 1cc run"
[0:33:13] <+lord_ludence> I usually get to about the boss of the 3rd stage if I'm lucky. Usually I get my ass handed to me before then though.
[0:33:19] <LeishmaniaForever> felli8Fatneck
[0:33:19] <HefestoForges> is it getting faster
[0:33:20] <StrangeCoincidence> 2ez
[0:33:21] <dukenux> Ive heard a lot about Ikaruga, this is first time isee someone playing it live
[0:33:25] <TJW211> stage 3 boss is a gate keeper in this game
[0:33:25] <hassanico> As a Touhou player I don't think the experience is comparable, Ikaruga is faster and has a bunch of environmental stuff you gotta dodge like walls and shit
[0:33:26] <%ChocolateFlobs> i play a bunch of the stuff that gets ported to steam, and I'm glad to see more Cave stuff come west through there.
[0:33:27] <+CezrDaPleazr> Woah
[0:33:28] <SuperArson> ikaruga is essentially more of a rhythm game when it comes to the bosses
[0:33:29] <+ShiftyFish> Is this Switch or PC?
[0:33:29] <$cureneckbeard> first try
[0:33:30] <%PoopyDickens> @arcturusblade LUL
[0:33:31] <+botchamaniac> Scarlet Devil is the best 2hu to start with.
[0:33:31] <+CezrDaPleazr> sirlioGasm
[0:33:34] <$cureneckbeard> switch
[0:33:34] <dukenux> Switch
[0:33:39] <slowbeef> Switch?!
[0:33:43] <+ogrest> this is it, it's finally happened, I made it in time for a Woolie stream
[0:33:46] <+ShiftyFish> Alright cool.
[0:33:46] <%Nmiser> yeah i've never seen this before either
[0:33:47] <crazydiamond_99> first time seeing this game
[0:33:47] <$megamonmon123> i think its beem recorded that no one has reached the end of ikaruga
[0:33:48] <slowbeef> There’s a switch version?!
[0:33:52] <crazydiamond_99> and holy hell i need to play this
[0:33:54] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> bijBooker
[0:33:57] <+Unis0> So excited to finally see you play a game you have talked about for years!
[0:33:57] <Mangahero18> the Schmup genre in general fills me with dread
[0:33:58] <hassanico> Yeah, stage 5 is a boss rush more or less
[0:33:58] <%Nmiser> The two colors mechanic is really cool
[0:33:59] <%PoopyDickens> any of you who haven't played this should try it, it's pretty intense
[0:34:00] <ScreamingMeat> MORTIS
[0:34:00] <Addamelech> voyage 1969
[0:34:02] <+ShiftyFish> There are a fair number of Shmups on Switch.
[0:34:02] <Notingles> any Eurojank Schmups around?
[0:34:07] <NonAddictiveSlurm> switch pot, sold!
[0:34:10] <+Sinoc229> get that eurojank outa here
[0:34:14] <mistermastergreg> this goes on sale for $5 on steam
[0:34:16] <+waterbuddy16> does switch have a vertical mode?
[0:34:16] <Idon__> Nintendo Switch *snaps fingers*
[0:34:17] <Emdhad> as a first time viewer of ikaruga can anyone let me know the difference between the two colours
[0:34:20] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> vinejoelGranddad vinejoelGranddad vinejoelGranddad
[0:34:21] <+ShiftyFish> Yes.
[0:34:22] <hassanico> The MUSIC! It's so good my ears are melting
[0:34:23] <+Sinoc229> switch has tate yes
[0:34:23] <+PersonaQueen18> Woooooooolieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee u da man.
[0:34:26] <dukenux> Is Jamestown eurojank?
[0:34:26] <%PoopyDickens> 120% BULLSHIT mode activated
[0:34:27] <MrHappyFunshine> Same never played or saw Ikaruga, played shmups when i was a kid but mostly R-Type
[0:34:28] <+TheArrow_> that's my pilot way
[0:34:29] <OkamiDude15> whens woolie gonna do his full lp of astebreed? sfhWOKE
[0:34:30] <Ognjenco> @WoolieVersus Maybe you should check out Zero Ranger, seems like a neat shmup
[0:34:32] <+bread_assassin> Sae. I heard people talking about it for years, but never saw someone actually playing it until now,
[0:34:34] <+Sinoc229> jamestown is suuuper eurojank
[0:34:35] <+Creatorofthearc> It's like if DmC's shitty weapon mechanic was a Schmup
[0:34:36] <$cureneckbeard> If the walls are immune to bullets, why don't they make the ships out of that material
[0:34:37] <dukenux> that's about the only other shmup i can name LUL
[0:34:37] <Mr_Strut> Coward out like a true hero!
[0:34:40] <+griffball13> True Heros hide from battle
[0:34:40] <Fluke_M> @Emdhad You have to switch colors to kill and not get damaged by a respective colors
[0:34:45] <+MightyMaxT> Is there any difference between the black bullets & white bullets that you shoot?
[0:34:46] <%ChocolateFlobs> @Emdhad you're immune to same color bullets, and you can switch between the two
[0:34:55] <teflonbilly777> @Emdhad White and black are technically not colors
[0:34:57] <%PoopyDickens> @cureneckbeard will that be answered in the lore? hmmm...
[0:35:05] <TheRectangular> what lore?
[0:35:12] <KappaKeepo42069> Whoa this looks like a lotta bs
[0:35:12] <yoshiunity> My ass gets handed to me with a black and white boot in it.
[0:35:14] <sparrrow_> DO COMBO
[0:35:16] <%PoopyDickens> true fraud from exposed
[0:35:16] <anAngryHamster> would a grey ship absorb both colors or be vulnerable to both?
[0:35:17] <+ogrest> @WoolieVersus apply duct tape to shoot button, and forget everything but shield transition timing
[0:35:18] <dukenux> I see black forcefield protects from black bullets and vice versa
[0:35:19] <UrsulaCat> god woolie such a loser
[0:35:20] <mr_slaide> Holy shit it's the Woolie!
[0:35:23] <Notingles> the choke is real
[0:35:26] <SuperArson> you do higher damage to opposite-colored enemies but the game works on a 3-chain system for scoring high
[0:35:28] <digitaldenam> @TheRectangular ikaruga has some deep lore
[0:35:30] <+PersonaQueen18> Nuke it all from orbit.
[0:35:30] <NonAddictiveSlurm> well the white has blue highlight and the black with red highlisghts, its a color now
[0:35:30] <Addamelech> that looks like one of Kaguya's last words
[0:35:32] <mr_slaide> Woolie is such a loser... I wish I was that cool.
[0:35:39] <SorcererLance> doodBenny doodBenny2 doodBenny3
[0:35:41] <Mangahero18> This game is crazy. Its like the fusion of a hardcore puzzle game and galaga.
[0:35:41] <GMN1> COWARD
[0:35:42] <dukenux> Hide in the corner, like a real coward!
[0:35:43] <%PoopyDickens> LUL

[0:36:01] <ZizerX> jesus haha
[0:36:04] <AggsMK7> Another one
[0:36:06] <SwindlerOfProgress> I bought this game on Switch looking for a shmup because I liked that aspect of Gungeon, and BOY did I get destroyed.
[0:36:08] <$cureneckbeard> Stage 5 never stops stopping
[0:36:12] <%PoopyDickens> this is a live vietnam flashback
[0:36:12] <Idon__> OH IT DOESN'T STOP
[0:36:15] <poweredscoot> I can't do shmups on anything but a keyboard
[0:36:17] <$megamonmon123> is that the real slowbeef?
[0:36:17] <%PinkieTheEerie> as a shmup this dosnt look ahat bad
[0:36:22] <%Solidus_113> When's Tempest 2000? woolieSMUG
[0:36:24] <hassanico> Time for the brain melts!

[0:36:26] <StrangeCoincidence> MY EYES
[0:36:26] <KappaKeepo42069> lazer spam I'm getting flashbacks to touhou
[0:36:28] <slowbeef> It’s a very good shmup
[0:36:29] <NonAddictiveSlurm> this seems like something that use the transition frames for something
[0:36:30] <+PersonaQueen18> I would fear anyone who is "good" at this.
[0:36:30] <%homelesstwinky> I thought it would stop woolieGASM
[0:36:33] <b1gboss007> Another one bites the dust
[0:36:35] <+deathbyace> ADAPT EVOLVE
[0:36:36] <+Sinoc229> when's crimson clover
[0:36:37] <Truxton_II> I knew a guy in college who questioned my taste when I told him I really liked the music in Ikaruga, I feel so vindicated now with so many here loving it.
[0:36:37] <HefestoForges> all those rips
[0:36:37] <%Menitta> Is this the Shmup where at some point your ghost from the past helps you
[0:36:38] <WG101> this gives me anxiety
[0:36:40] <Mr_Strut> Oh that's just unfair
[0:36:41] <dukenux> EVOLVE OR DIE
[0:36:47] <sparrrow_> don't worry your supposed to die a shit ton in this
[0:36:47] <hassanico> @Menitta That's Gradius V
[0:36:47] <$cureneckbeard> The music in Ikaruga is amazing
[0:36:49] <odd_slater> W O O L I E

[0:41:07] <shahtray> >tfw 2 am but woolie is streaming
[0:41:08] <sparrrow_> SMT Synchronicity Prologue has a mechanic that's a reference to Ikaruga color switching
[0:41:09] <StrangeCoincidence> this reminds me of xenosaga
[0:41:10] <Mangahero18> I cant wait for woolie to take on "Ultra WTF OMG This is so HARDMODE"
[0:41:11] <hassanico> We're getting there...

[0:41:22] <MrSpaceLion> they supposed to be some twisted angels?
[0:41:27] <Idon__> Bro, I'm still waiting on a full SMT synchronicity game

[0:41:35] <saxmastey> FUCK THAT
[0:41:38] <+KyroDragon> what the fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck
[0:41:43] <%Menitta> this is hard to look at
[0:41:48] <Idon__> SO MANY BULLETS
[0:41:51] <hassanico> Honest Man's Death EX
[0:41:51] <dukenux> jesus chroist
[0:41:51] <GMN1> There is so much shit in the screen, what the actual fuck is this game SwiftRage
[0:41:57] <slowbeef> God I love this
[0:42:05] <ecksbockstreefitty> This game is great but it ain't no Police Batrider
[0:42:06] <+ogrest> I see this and I want to go, play, some fuckin, deathsmiles, so I can have normal ass normal rules
[0:42:07] <Alseid> VICTORY LAP HUH?
[0:42:15] <%PoopyDickens> this boy is pushing your shit in
[0:42:19] <HeadsHeldHigh> victory lap is new lore
[0:42:20] <WonkaThing> raizing > treasure but they're both good
[0:42:22] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I can't play a bullet hell like this and bother aiming, it's all evasion
[0:42:23] <hassanico> @Alseid The stage, not the boss
[0:42:23] <%Menitta> I guess they never miss huh
[0:42:28] <pillowwasp> First try
[0:42:29] <LeishmaniaForever> felli8Fatneck felli8Fatneck felli8Fatneck
[0:42:34] <+wwwwwww1> how can our eyes be real
[0:42:37] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Why are the final bosses to shmups almost always some sort of weird flesh bound mechanical creature?
[0:42:38] <UrsulaCat> thinking emoji
[0:42:39] <hassanico> We're still in phase 1 btw
[0:42:39] <Emdhad> so according to woolie "anything black takes double damage from white bullets" huh
[0:42:39] <+griffball13> you feel it to don't you
[0:42:39] <%GohanEgret> woolieCHAN woolieCHAN woolieCHAN woolieCHAN
[0:42:40] <+Sinoc229> 'if you're good at video games it's easy

[0:42:40] <%PoopyDickens> Kappa
[0:42:45] <%Nmiser> thats pretty cool
[0:42:48] <Truxton_II> Radiant Silvergun reference~
[0:42:49] <SwindlerOfProgress> By comparison, this is super easy.
[0:42:50] <+SaurianCrash> Level Scob
[0:42:50] <saxmastey> THIS VICTORY IS NOT FOR YOU
[0:42:51] <Idon__> Oh wow , now they're tracking
[0:42:52] <+Zero_ELEC> now, 1cc it
[0:42:56] <+NarcissistCactus> just be good 4Head
[0:42:58] <fruit_pie_the_magician> RIDE THE SNAKE
[0:43:00] <Superdandy96> Whole ‘nother level, coming from my mind HolidayCookie
[0:43:02] <HeadsHeldHigh> it's a trail of tears for us scrubs
[0:43:09] <NonAddictiveSlurm> does keeping your bar at max power up normal bullets, if not it should
[0:43:09] <teflonbilly777> Honestly, this isn't THAT busy of a screen for a hardcore bullet hell game. As I said earlier, it's just extremely elegantly designed
[0:43:11] <+fatal_penguin_> Is this Slither.io
[0:43:12] <StrangeCoincidence> not the sexy snekk i was expecting
[0:43:13] <speximillian> Use your ENERGY MAX
[0:43:16] <MarianoTekken> i still cant finish donpachi
[0:43:17] <sparrrow_> trouser snakes
[0:43:19] <KappaKeepo42069> Woolie says this is easier but he sure is dying a lot more
[0:43:20] <MrSpaceLion> how the hell is this possible without dying!!!
[0:43:24] <Lilgamba> Isn't this, like, infamously difficult?
[0:43:24] <masterfire23> I've only played shmups on mobile LUL
[0:43:27] <fruit_pie_the_magician> You aren't riding the snake correctly
[0:43:28] <StrangeCoincidence> LITERALLY SLITHERIO
[0:43:31] <+Sinoc229> ikaruga's not realy a bullet hell, it's very reserved
[0:43:37] <b1gboss007> GAMBARE
[0:43:43] <%PoopyDickens> it's hard for me to enjoy this because i really feel like i'm playing
[0:43:45] <StrangeCoincidence> WHAT THE HELL IS THAT
[0:43:46] <+ogrest> this bullshit rattlesnake tactic is, just not right man
[0:43:46] <$megamonmon123> hard but you love it huh?
[0:43:48] <+libbnattin> HI WOLLIE
[0:43:48] <hassanico> STAGE 1 REPRISE
[0:43:49] <Alseid> EMIL?
[0:43:50] <StrangeCoincidence> METAPHYCHOSIS? WHAT
[0:43:50] <Idon__> I have no idea what the hell the plot's trying to say
[0:43:51] <teflonbilly777> @Sinoc229 Yeah, it has more of a puzzle element to it
[0:43:52] <%DreyfussFrost> If you guys think there's a lot of the screen here, go watch Mushihimesama. This is NOTHING.
[0:43:52] <reokie_t7> Yeah this aint touhu but this will still break your balls
[0:43:53] <hassanico> ENERGY MAX
[0:43:53] <%TeethMuncher> Next up, Touhou!
[0:43:53] <pillowwasp> I didn’t know they turned the smash ultimate credits into a full game
[0:43:55] <+fatal_penguin_> "its hard and I love it" -Woolie
[0:43:55] <SwindlerOfProgress> I'm trash at this game, it's OK.
[0:43:55] <+Zero_ELEC> These spell patterns are too easy
[0:43:56] <+OmegaWeltall> man i love this part Kreygasm
[0:43:56] <StrangeCoincidence> OH MY GOD THIS SONG
[0:43:57] <gunsrlove> player us supposed to die
[0:43:58] <+DevinMayCry> This is the coolest part of the game
[0:43:59] <+SaurianCrash> its lss bullet hell and more color hell
[0:43:59] <hassanico> Parry battle!
[0:44:00] <fruit_pie_the_magician> When riding the snake, you must lead
[0:44:01] <OozieStream> How the fuck do you beat this normally
[0:44:02] <+Yokuho> It's kind of boring to watch
[0:44:03] <StrangeCoincidence> YOU SAY RUN
[0:44:03] <+DevinMayCry> Is this entire sequence
[0:44:05] <Idon__> just use your bomb
[0:44:08] <sparrrow_> there's a really cool free mobile shmup called Bullet Hell Monday
[0:44:10] <$cureneckbeard> energy max
[0:44:11] <Daxalog> "Hey, I do that" - You, to the boss
[0:44:13] <+ogrest> wait are those it's macross bullet barrages?
[0:44:13] <ecksbockstreefitty> touhou or nohou
[0:44:14] <hassanico> ENERGY MAX
[0:44:18] <Reanimator83> I gotta plug my GameCube in and play this again
[0:44:18] <+ogrest> Is this guitar hero or a bullet hell
[0:44:19] <+Sinoc229> this part is the coolest to watch a good player do
[0:44:21] <+ogrest> what even is this
[0:44:21] <Mangahero18> I would kill for an Orchestral Remix of this soundtrack. Who is with me?
[0:44:23] <TrollKing96> Holy shit that life bar.
[0:44:31] <buster7800> if this were an anime the op would be playn right now
[0:44:32] <Mr_Strut> It seems like there's an entire mecha anime leading up to this game that I've never seen.
[0:44:32] <Truxton_II> Fun fact: If you do this part perfectly the music at the beginning syncs up perfectly
[0:44:33] <%LethargicRush> HERE WE GO
[0:44:34] <+SaurianCrash> why can we never counter bullet hell on bosses

[0:47:55] <hassanico> @WoolieVersus this game is so freaking sad dude
[0:47:57] <+DevinMayCry> Think of it this way. The quarters to beat the game or 5o dollars. Whats cheaper.
[0:47:59] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> vinejoelDio vinejoelDio vinejoelDio
[0:48:03] <%PoopyDickens> give us dat lore
[0:48:03] <%DreyfussFrost> @generalve Pretty sure that was infinite lives mode, beating it with limited lives is the real challenge, there's side content, and also it's REALLY GOOD.

[0:48:40] <$Chatterbox1991> mrdestructoid100 Super thankful for being as cool as you were at Magfest, immensely gratful for signing my copy of THUG 1 (same one i got near launch over a decade ago at a Blockbuster in Damascus, MD, to give a picture of how jank that copy was) hope to maybe go next year's Magfest. Quick Question; as you are a connoisseur of comics, what are your thoughts on Jim Sterenko and his artwork? (Nick Fury and Doctor Strange circa 1970s)
[0:48:46] <StrangeCoincidence> Lulu has bigger plot!
[0:48:48] <UrsulaCat> ah, chatterbox

[0:56:46] <Mangahero18> That Lady is totally Lulu
[0:56:49] <pillowwasp> The laser bullets stand for laser bullets
[0:56:51] <galuda7> We'll never get a third Project RS game (this is RS-2) since Treasure's more or less dead. And they need funding for games.
[0:56:51] <%Menitta> But Devil Engine is super cool
[0:56:57] <OkamiDude15> @DevinMayCry thats a arcysy fight intro if ive ever heard one
[0:57:06] <pandangerous> ikaruga Kreygasm
[0:57:06] <ecksbockstreefitty> galuda- I think it would technically go to square enix
[0:57:07] <dukenux> Calm before the storm?
[0:57:08] <+dopeboy_i> yeah go deeper, we ready for all this
[0:57:14] <dukenux> RED
[0:57:20] <StrangeCoincidence> The IDEAL
[0:57:27] <+DevinMayCry> Metempsychosis: the supposed transmigration at death of the soul of a human being or animal into a new body of the same or a different species.
[0:57:39] <galuda7> Yeah, I checked, Enix was the OG publisher, NIntendo just brought it out in America
[0:57:44] <StrangeCoincidence> This is like the scientific method. hypothesis, experiment
[0:57:45] <%TeethMuncher> I'm okay with this impromptu TED talk
[0:57:49] <+SaurianCrash> WOOLIE Vs DEVIL ENGINE! !!
[0:57:55] <+Unregisteredhypercamtwo> you dont just throw around the term "metempsychosis" unless you're up to something
[0:57:57] <DeathGripsSan> has he like, played the game yet?
[0:58:01] <gespenst_mr_ghost> Oh hey its the Woolie
[0:58:06] <galuda7> meanwhile, Sin & Punishment 3 NEVER, since Nintendo owns that IP and S&P2 didn't do so well because the average Wii owner didn't like challenging games. Kappa
[0:58:10] <gespenst_mr_ghost> Hello
[0:58:12] <slix343> Yes, philosophy is half the game now
[0:58:13] <JumbleJams> yes he's alreasy played
[0:58:18] <UrsulaCat> "moving forward in some direction" you idiot the only way forward is forward
[0:58:18] <AhegaoAcademy> We totally didn't show the clip of Devil Engine hype to the developer and make him happy.
[0:58:27] <AhegaoAcademy> That we now get to take back from him.
[0:58:28] <%PoopyDickens> 4 tests your faith more than this
[0:58:40] <Mangahero18> The game is done. This is Mr Madden's Story Time.
[0:58:42] <Bennett_Fracture> do you think a ikaruga character would fit in the smash brothers cinematic universe...
[0:58:43] <StrangeCoincidence> Ideal to reality, hmmmmmm
[0:58:48] <ecksbockstreefitty> So what you're telling me Galuda..... is Marina could be in small ultimate hapJoy
[0:58:54] <Bennett_Fracture> or am i getting ahead of myself here...
[0:58:55] <joylent_blue> reality is difficult its true FeelsBadMan
[0:58:57] <galuda7> oddly enough, stage 4 is easier than stage 3 on easy mode, but yeah, the hardest of the bunch on normal
[0:59:07] <ecksbockstreefitty> smash*
[0:59:08] <KappaKeepo42069> FeelsBadMan TOO REAL
[0:59:10] <dukenux> SNAP! back to reality
[0:59:10] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Clownface or cockpit?
[0:59:16] <StrangeCoincidence> we should really be having this conversation in a parked car in between classes
[0:59:20] <+OmegaWeltall> yea.. too real FeelsBadMan
[0:59:26] <b1gboss007> Why is woolie going full metal gear villan?
[0:59:30] <+ApocalypticExpress> @galuda7 I like how apparently Treasure originally made it like fairly hard anbd then a nintendo tester played it with wii remote cursor and said "It's too easy, make it harder," or so I recall
[0:59:31] <slix343> Ok to be fair to Woolie, the names of the levels is a good place to build this idea on
[0:59:33] <+TxukasaVersus> Woolieeeeee : D

[1:00:27] <OkamiDude15> you must [not] give up
[1:00:28] <hard_bop_sax_solo> I personally would like to read Woolie's literature
[1:00:35] <%humbelpie> I made it what did i miss?
[1:00:41] <%akuda_bar> this is the last time i audit a class before i take the introductory level
[1:00:44] <dukenux> So the aim of Ikaruga is to reach Nirvana?
[1:00:44] <Doodle_Taco> This is some deep st7ff
[1:00:48] <Idon__> Wait, what was the ending. How did he blow up?
[1:00:49] <%AntithesisEK> Woolie vs Nirvana
[1:00:50] <%robobeau> Shin Megami Tensei also roughly translates to "True Goddess Metempsychosis"
[1:00:51] <honmaheadbutt> You could say you REBOOT
[1:00:54] <seylumiue> @humbelpie one run at the game, then lore dump
[1:00:56] <OkamiDude15> woolie just did his run of ikaruga and is talking about the lore of ikaruga @humbelpie
[1:01:00] <+JackMillerTime> I love this

[1:01:13] <galuda7> he blew up because releasing enough stored energy to destroy the Stone-Like was also what destroyed his own ship

[1:01:35] <hard_bop_sax_solo> The Stone Buddha
[1:01:38] <zoranbiocic> thought this game was about black and white dots?
[1:01:38] <%TeethMuncher> Wasn't metempsychosis Pucci's plan in Jojo 6?
[1:01:40] <StrangeCoincidence> you must defeat stubbornness?
[1:01:41] <%humbelpie> Wait Ikaruga has a plot? I thought the only bullet hell with plot is the Touhou series
[1:01:43] <b1gboss007> NotLikeThis
[1:01:48] <bigboy3d> It's like a Zen game. Mastering Ikaruga is reaching enlightenment
[1:01:54] <%PoopyDickens> i'm the unstoppable force tho
[1:01:59] <+OmegaWeltall> yea Ikaruga lore is some deep shit
[1:02:00] <+DevinMayCry> Hell yeah you are
[1:02:08] <Idon__> row row, fight the power
[1:02:09] <DeebzNutz100> RedTeam doodBeamL doodBeam doodBeam doodBeam
[1:02:11] <hassanico> @WoolieVersus And the StoneLike itself shit talks you and tells you you can't escape the cycle
[1:02:14] <galuda7> humbelpie - go look up the plots for some Cave shooters. particularly the Dodonpachi and Mushihimesama series'.
[1:02:17] <SuperArson> there's quite a few shmups with pretty solid story but ikaruga is very deep in terms of lore
[1:02:18] <RippleWarrior> Both can lose tho
[1:02:22] <slix343> The alternate theory is just get in the fucking mecha right?
[1:02:25] <Mangahero18> I thought the plot of Touhou was 'Hey look at these Waifu'
[1:02:26] <SuperArson> dodonpachi is good tho
[1:02:26] <StrangeCoincidence> OH MY GOD WOOLIE WAS RIGHT
[1:02:26] <galuda7> in RSG, the Stone-Like is more or less God.
[1:02:28] <UrsulaCat> enlightenment
[1:02:32] <+SPKTR34> came for bullet hell and I ended up on existencial hell, thanks @WoolieVersus
[1:02:35] <ecksbockstreefitty> Ikaruga: No R[E]gret
[1:02:36] <+ogrest> I like it
[1:02:39] <Jashter18> Well yeah when faced with God you first instinct is to punch him in his face
[1:02:45] <KappaKeepo42069> That's a solid analysis
[1:02:45] <+deathbyace> EX Clap
[1:02:48] <megajohnny> also the stone-like has a time loop in-universe, which you kinda break in ikaruga, right?
[1:02:49] <joylent_blue> but thats just a.... WOOLIE THEORY
[1:02:49] <%PoopyDickens> this isn't that deep, kinda just buddhism-lite LUL
[1:02:50] <Belutima> @ecksbockstreefitty give this man a medal
[1:02:57] <%lord_ludence> Woolie its a fucking great headcannon. I'm down with it.
[1:02:58] <ShreddingPixels> I liked your ted talk
[1:02:58] <+DevinMayCry> This is why Ikaruga is peak game design. The layers of gameplay and simplicity make it like a Tetris tier game of constant improvement
[1:02:59] <UrsulaCat> woolie I can't make fun of you I am 10 x worse
[1:03:00] <tungstenviper> this game has an amazing philosophy
[1:03:00] <bignerb> your... game theory?
[1:03:00] <+bread_assassin> But it's just a theory a Game Theory.
[1:03:03] <+JackMillerTime> naw thats what it is even if someone tells me its not
[1:03:03] <GeneralResource> there's a ton of shmups out there where the story revolves around death and rebirth
[1:03:03] <+fatal_penguin_> Deep in the booty
[1:03:03] <hard_bop_sax_solo> has woolie ever looked hotter?
[1:03:04] <GoldeNOVA> Ikaruga Lore when

[1:03:07] <+NarcissistCactus> sick religion
[1:03:08] <poweredscoot> shmup lore is the best
[1:03:08] <kbt1945> i always play shmups for the story
[1:03:09] <teflonbilly777> Ikaruga is Woolie's true religion
[1:03:12] <NonAddictiveSlurm> you ARE up your own ass but i'll climb in there too LUL
[1:03:12] <+Unregisteredhypercamtwo> Ikaruga visits the pope
[1:03:12] <+thebonebard> you really are plagues friend
[1:03:15] <%Knopantz> Ok but how do we get Zubaz in there?
[1:03:15] <+WhyIDie> art is meant to be appreciated inside your own ass though, and ikaruga is art
[1:03:16] <%CubicPhantom> you're not completely up your own ass. just like a little bit inside that sphincter

[1:03:19] <DeebzNutz100> @WoolieVersus You ever Thunder force 4?
[1:03:19] <galuda7> According to the lead developers/directors at Treasure, Radiant Silvergun is about being caught in a cycle, while Ikaruga is about breaking the cycle.

[1:03:37] <%Menitta> two controllers
[1:03:39] <+DevinMayCry> Cause you could beat the game after working really hard but beating it with emphasis on your combo? Fuck man. You gotta spend 10,000 hours for that.

[1:03:49] <%Nmiser> 2 player?
[1:03:54] <Idon__> Nocturne's my favorite JRPG. I hope he plays it sometime.

[1:11:36] <+Deft_Thought> The previous generation using their wisdom to give you the tools necessary to fight an impossible battle is a pretty on the nose metaphor about life too
[1:11:38] <%Nmiser> literally sitting at college right now having no idea what i'm doing

[1:13:31] <%DreyfussFrost> Yeah, what trips up must shmup newbies and people that don't play them at all is seeing the projectiles as static but they're not. You need to look at the paths the projectiles are one and visualize the invisible lines they're following. Once you can visualize the lines, you can also visualize the gaps, and you just stay inside the gaps.
[1:13:32] <sparrrow_> Butt Iron?
[1:13:38] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> ABSOLUTE UNIT INCOMING

[1:14:42] <+LegendCobra> should I play this with infinite continues if im bad?
[1:14:43] <+ogrest> @Reanimator83 so, xbox port is trash but has online multiplayer, most faithful is dreamcast, and pc is the best port for extra features and presentation

[1:25:12] <AThing_> @Doodle_Taco there are several ways to interpret that m8 and one of them you definitely don't want
[1:25:18] <alloftheworld_1> "Always penetrate kids" OR "Always penetrate, kids" 🤔

[1:27:37] <+Godjaw> This wheel is literally the Eightfold Path
[1:27:39] <sparrrow_> @WoolieVersus Tekkai means "iron body" so it is probably referring to bosses in general
[1:27:39] <$cureneckbeard> Dark Souls is the Ikaruga of RPGs

[1:32:32] <%arcturusblade> so where does "using credits taints your score with a non-zero ones digit" fall into this?
[1:32:34] <+fatal_penguin_> The goal is Penetration
[1:32:37] <aiyobro> this game is why I don't like undertale or nier automata

[2:01:10] <wirblewomble> @kentashiro oh god, I wasn't paying that much attention, and I thought you were joking at first, but he is just watching someone else play. I feel sorta dumb.
[2:01:14] <RosELLo6> my discord authority is enough
[2:01:16] <Superdandy96> The stream tax is real
[2:01:17] <gustavozxd> oh man i didn't even notice

[2:02:02] <RosELLo6> fuck you
[2:02:11] <jackiedan> The ikaruga was the friends we made along the way

[2:02:33] <%Klefth> I've always sucked HORRIBLY at shmups, so looking at this is incredible
[2:02:35] <RosELLo6> ITS NOT MY BIRTHDAY
[2:02:36] <digitaldenam> LUL
[2:02:38] <+Dovakhin573> but its red and blue?
[2:02:40] <RosELLo6> WOOLIE WILL TELL YOU HE KNOWS

[2:02:42] <%Totally_not_toby> T A K E O U T T H E B L A C K
[2:02:48] <wirblewomble> @daxalog oh lord I can't imagine a shmup on the ds.
[2:02:59] <+DevinMayCry> You can earn extra lives. Thats encouraging for my hopes of getting any score up someday
[2:03:04] <Flunkorg> @Klefth Btw, this is on normal. Theirs harder difficulty modes
[2:03:05] <+thebonebard> race traitor woolie strikes again
[2:03:06] <MelBrooksKA> @DeebzNutz100 Why not multi twitch, then you can just look back and forth between the left and right boob spyCappa
[2:03:08] <tungstenviper> BIG OOF
[2:03:20] <poweredscoot> I'm glad we've finally moved on from the never ending ball jokes with this game
[2:03:30] <+DevinMayCry> This is dog fighting in 2d and its impressive
[2:03:31] <Daxalog> @wirblewomble The shooting was on the top screen and weapon choice and bomb use was the bottom screen (optionally)
[2:03:34] <UrsulaCat> now it's just the race jokes
[2:03:36] <DeebzNutz100> @MelBrooksKA Mmmm... boobs
[2:03:40] <+lyfeindeyth> What? Woolie, stop playing such awesome games, this is very unexpected D:
[2:03:41] <gustavozxd> I heard this game fucks you on easy
[2:03:54] <tungstenviper> He understands the pattern well
[2:04:00] <mylesmoore> would rather watch this than watch the remaining 4 hours of people shouting ORB
[2:04:01] <+SpamKingRathalos> hype
[2:04:04] <MutedMimic> Kreygasm
[2:04:04] <pandangerous> Kreygasm
[2:04:08] <+clack14> Kreygasm
[2:04:10] <SwindlerOfProgress> I mean, it seems simple enough looking at it, but actually understanding what's going on is different.
[2:04:10] <+HauntingHALO06> this is giving me anxiety
[2:04:15] <Belutima> I can slowlsy see the patern.... I understand what he was trying to do
[2:04:40] <+GN93> i only just realised woolie wasnt controlling
[2:04:40] <UrsulaCat> @HauntingHALO06 don't worry you aren't playing this game. you don't need to pay attention too hard
[2:04:50] <%buttdirt> this guy would make a perfect hockey goalie with the reflexes that he has, jesus fucking christ
[2:04:58] <%lord_ludence> If this seems simple play the game.
[2:05:01] <DeebzNutz100> some say White/Black I always saw Blue/Red
[2:05:10] <SwindlerOfProgress> It's OK, that's more or less what I meant.
[2:05:15] <FuqBoiSlim> you need a hi IQ to really get ikaruga
[2:05:16] <%Explodincatz> we dont even know
[2:05:31] <pandangerous> I wonder how hard this gets in co-op
[2:05:34] <%AntithesisEK> no refuge
[2:05:35] <+NarcissistCactus> some say kosm
[2:05:35] <Doodle_Taco> This is what normal people experience when the smart anime character does something
[2:05:36] <MutedMimic> Ill explode
[2:05:38] <+kevinr220> 2deep4me. I should get back to playing this.
[2:05:39] <gwbtoast> You have to be REALLY quick with those switches of color
[2:05:41] <Hotironclad> I played the game, I was scared to death to just survive
[2:05:43] <$cureneckbeard> NO REFUGE
[2:05:50] <tungstenviper> @WoolieVersus you gotta avoid + shoot + change + chain + absorb and then inverse everything
[2:05:52] <UrsulaCat> don't let girls see you drop combos
[2:05:56] <speximillian> So this is Liam playing?
[2:06:03] <+digitaljeff> OUT FUCKING SKILLED
[2:06:06] <+SpamKingRathalos> jesus
[2:06:11] <+GN93> use your sharingan woolie

[2:06:42] <+digitaljeff> Mission Status: SICK
[2:06:46] <Laironx3> Get in and get out immediately!
[2:06:49] <Cthulos> Is this PS4?
[2:06:50] <+HardboiledBoi> Operation is the US version
[2:06:54] <+doragonkiba> to be fair you need a really high iq in order to understand ikaruga. the gameplay is very subtle, and without a solid grasp of color theory most of the patterns will go over a typical gamer's head.
[2:06:56] <ArkhamG> my dude, this is so hard to pull
[2:07:03] <digitaldenam> @Cthulos switch
[2:07:09] <$Chatterbox1991> Back
[2:07:10] <odd_slater> @Cthulos Yeah
[2:07:16] <UrsulaCat> I mean given how dumb gamers usually are... @doragonkiba
[2:07:22] <Cthulos> ah, can't make out the controller in his hand
[2:07:36] <alloftheworld_1> No wasted movement Kreygasm
[2:07:39] <odd_slater> He's playing on Switch
[2:07:45] <odd_slater> But it's on everything
[2:07:48] <+TopTieramisu> it's all 1s and 0s
[2:07:53] <+TopTieramisu> to this guy
[2:07:53] <+HeathCottengim> balanced for yawn
[2:08:00] <digitaldenam> @Cthulos he isn't playing right now
[2:08:16] <alloftheworld_1> "You're saying I can dodge bullets?" "When you're good enough, you won't have to."
[2:08:16] <Cthulos> I have it on Switch, that 3D rumble is neat
[2:08:18] <SephirKath> Didn't Spike use Jeet kun do?
[2:08:22] <+TopTieramisu> oh it's berserk heart

[2:08:32] <RedoctoberWolf> yooooo this is tight

[2:08:48] <+VanaSkiller> someone else

[2:09:12] <%buttdirt> you're playing snoke while avoiding bullets...holy fuck
[2:09:13] <+clack14> this game is legit awesome tho
[2:09:15] <+DevinMayCry> With grappling hooks because grappling hooks on mechs and ships are the best
[2:09:17] <%buttdirt> snake*

[2:09:25] <Idon__> This is it
[2:09:39] <UrsulaCat> don't drop that combo

[2:10:08] <+fatal_penguin_> It means Penetration
[2:10:09] <gustavozxd> S+++
[2:10:09] <UrsulaCat> "get" and "good"
[2:10:10] <+ClumsyYoukai> @WoolieVersus have you seen the timeout of t hat boss? it owns so hard
[2:10:10] <speximillian> He didn't even beat it? Lame.
[2:10:12] <+thebonebard> oh sht i forgot to look
[2:10:22] <bignerb> @daxalog they aren’t black and white
[2:10:22] <MutedMimic> Difficulty normal, OhGod
[2:10:23] <RedoctoberWolf> man this is some extra stage touhou bs
[2:10:23] <Flunkorg> Can we now have the real video game?
[2:10:23] <TheTakkster> Kiwami means Ikaruga
[2:10:24] <+cherokee2391> no words dude
[2:10:26] <digitaldenam> WHEN YOU HIT THOSE EVACANEER PATTERNS

[2:10:35] <%boomstarprime> i could never beat the end of stage 4 legit'
[2:10:37] <@akuda_bar> it's like All You Need is Kill
[2:10:38] <+thebonebard> look at that dark protagonist
[2:10:45] <%boomstarprime> my brain would just melt
[2:10:48] <alloftheworld_1> When you delete childhood memories from your brain for more pattern recognition LUL
[2:10:48] <DeebzNutz100> Then you pick up 2 sticks and start all over again
[2:10:49] <aiyobro> i'm pretty sure i got to that at least
[2:10:53] <+DevinMayCry> Oh hey theres the sword general guy too in the far back
[2:10:54] <%lord_ludence> The fact that you can fail to complete the game and still get the top 10 shows how fucking crazy this game is. That guy kicked serious ass too, not to say he didn't.
[2:10:58] <generalve> take a break
[2:11:04] <gustavozxd> dude's name there is probably Edge or something
[2:11:05] <%Solidus_113> Ahegao!
[2:11:07] <gwbtoast> man that was some sick ass bullet hell! The best i can manage is playing some Gungeon. Ikaruga looks so intense!
[2:11:08] <+VanaSkiller> @akuda_bar dude I was just thinking that
[2:11:10] <@SoushinSen> DO you guys wanna raid me?
[2:11:11] <+clack14> great ted talk SeemsGood

[2:11:14] <+Noponiz> good showcase!
[2:11:19] <$cureneckbeard> Ikaruga is a classic
[2:11:20] <+DevinMayCry> What are you playing Minh?
[2:11:23] <alloftheworld_1> TED Talk: Ikaruga is awesome, here's why you should play it Keepo
[2:11:23] <@SoushinSen> oh wait, unless woolie isn't finished
[2:11:28] <@akuda_bar> @VanaSkiller yeah i always think of all you need is kill for stories like this
[2:11:31] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> vinejoelGranddad vinejoelGranddad vinejoelGranddad vinejoelGranddad vinejoelGranddad vinejoelGranddad
[2:11:37] <@SoushinSen> OH never mind, MORE woolie games!
[2:11:37] <gustavozxd> woolie's genuine love for videogames makes me happy
[2:11:40] <+doragonkiba> a modern platform isn't a real platform until it's had ikaruga and resident evil 4 ported to it
[2:11:41] <+NarcissistCactus> Pog
[2:11:47] <%mistspade> Yeah we gonna date liam
[2:11:47] <+griffball13> ok best ships go
[2:11:52] <@SoushinSen> yeyeye
[2:11:53] <DeebzNutz100> Ikaruga was an un-expected jem for me
[2:11:53] <%galaxyswirl> LUL
[2:11:57] <wirblewomble> The only platform I can get ikaruga on is gamecube though
[2:11:57] <gustavozxd> so many people using empty words to describe games, this though this is for real
[2:12:02] <AggsMK7> Nice
[2:12:06] <mrbiskuits> I just wished Treasure ported more of their games

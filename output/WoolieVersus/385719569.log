[0:42:00] <mrjohncarlton> While you were fixing the stream HE was studying the blade
[0:42:05] <MattDemers> I mean, I don't think anyone addicted to Apex will have the patience to get bopped by the much lower time-to-kill in this game.
[0:42:05] <leoneofthestars> uhhhh
[0:42:06] <tna4lyfer> no RE2?
[0:42:07] <Smitteys867> ronin was always good
[0:42:08] <MavMarsh> ronin's always been good
[0:42:09] <WorstCompany> Will always push Ronin
[0:42:13] <teflonbilly777> The post game escape is such a cool feature
[0:42:13] <+Pariah6950> @T_Sasquatch Ronin is kinda op
[0:42:14] <ScreamingMeat> maybe 6v6 is best
[0:42:17] <42TheNewbie> there's a private invite thing that you click "ok" on when "notskullgod" wants to start a private match, for anyone wondering how to join woolies game
[0:42:18] <Pookiedaexzile> Just play Apex my guy, you moving the same speed

[0:42:30] <%GohanEgret> BibleThump
[0:42:31] <%MedicalMechanica> Hey Woolie, if you die and you have your titan available for calldown, you can actually choose to spawn inside your titan and fall with it.
[0:42:31] <%Solidnick18> woolie gonna try monarch?
[0:42:32] <@Menitta> so does everyone use grapple now?

[0:42:52] <Darksword64> @Menitta You can break the games speed cap with it
[0:42:52] <garbageheaphound> you got carried
[0:42:52] <%Solidnick18> most people use the phase shift
[0:42:54] <+Shampoohyay> no problem yall
[0:42:54] <teflonbilly777> EA did the release of this game dirty sandwiching it between CoD and Battlefield
[0:42:54] <%MaiHusbando9S> eesh
[0:42:55] <SleepyMaribo> so good
[0:42:55] <%SeriousMrBlack> BEASTING

[0:43:27] <SleepyMaribo> we got apex over this...
[0:43:28] <+Mikeykratos> my favorite way to play titanfall 2 is with a drum and bass mix blasting in my headphones
[0:43:32] <Prism_Wing> I have no idea what I just watched
[0:43:34] <%yeknomlive> i need to go back and finish the campaign
[0:43:38] <ScreamingMeat> 8v8 seems a bit too hectic

[0:51:31] <@Squdnate> @abadbadman There is a wallrunning character coming to Apex soon. It was datamined
[0:51:39] <%abadbadman> ooft

[0:51:42] <+Nobrev> @AFlyingTaco1 not while sprinting
[0:51:42] <teflonbilly777> @abadbadman The levels aren't really built for wall running though. Now if they implemented wall hanging, that'd be way OP

[0:51:53] <+peri_d0t> this map looks amazing

[0:55:21] <Joestar1890> Nothing's cooler/sadder than having your Titan's eject message be "See you space cowboy"
[0:55:22] <T4silly> @woolieversus You could try Titan Brawl. Titans only, with respawns.
[0:55:23] <+alpacasintophats> either way this is good
[0:55:25] <lewdskeletor13> @alpacasintophats Just TF today

[0:55:57] <%mukbun> into pit
[0:56:00] <Belutima> Game volume is good, Skull volume is loud.
[0:56:02] <Joestar1890> Woolie's a little low for me, but fine
[0:56:04] <MavMarsh> the rust is real
[0:56:06] <+TaifuDragon> Volume is spot on
[0:56:08] <alwayspronking> BACK TO THE PIT
[0:56:09] <ghostravens> back to the pit
[0:56:09] <Ralyks9117> wish he played on ps4
[0:56:10] <the_solarflare> pit is the MVP
[0:56:10] <N1netbattler> take a swim
[0:56:11] <megan0va1> did any1 get the becomes the master acheivement here bc i did B)
[0:56:16] <lewdskeletor13> So it seems like Apex has helped renew interest in Titanfall
[0:56:18] <Ferakin> Skull's a shitposting bitch, get him Woolie
[0:56:21] <+meatgeneral69> are they not playing re2 tonight?
[0:56:24] <+Willdog1993> I DIDN'T LEARN TO READ
[0:56:27] <RazielTheDark> @GoogleyGareth Gaaaaaaaaaarrry!
[0:56:29] <Pookiedaexzile> He's not rusty he's playing with a controller on PC, He's basically a normal dude fighitng a Newtype
[0:56:30] <lewdskeletor13> @meatgeneral69 Nope
[0:56:33] <krymzen5> stream lag?
[0:56:36] <%mukbun> @meatgeneral69 nah
[0:56:36] <dabirSA> the volume is good but I'm pretty sure the game audio has an echo
[0:56:39] <MavMarsh> true dat
[0:56:43] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @krymzen5 yea
[0:56:44] <Raztron> lol for real Pookie
[0:56:46] <%yeknomlive> he's playing with limiters
[0:56:54] <+Detectivemac9> fighting M&K with a controller in titanfall has gotta be rough
[0:56:58] <dabirSA> but I think I'm the only one who's hearing it so
[0:57:03] <+Pariah6950> I don't think Woolie uses claw grip. If you don't claw, you can't play Titanfall on controller
[0:57:05] <%mukbun> tino pit
[0:57:10] <%fFailureatlife> pfffffffft
[0:57:10] <generalve> FALCON PUNCH
[0:57:13] <+Willdog1993> YEET

[0:57:50] <+Chaossheep> Oh my god this just reminded me of how much I miss TF2.
[0:57:51] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> look its the Titanguy
[0:58:03] <JohnRadical> and hes falling
[0:58:05] <%UrsulaCat> it's the teen titanguy

[0:58:40] <dabirSA> it can't just be me getting the audio echo right
[0:58:41] <%mukbun> big burn boy

[0:59:21] <+Pariah6950> The only misstep I think Titanfall 2 made over 1 is that in 1 you were always in first person. Felt much more visceral that way

[0:59:50] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 1 hour. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 4oz (120mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[0:59:52] <%Zebroneath> Titanfall is one of those series where, even if you end up losing, it doesn't feel so bad cause everything's rad as fuck.
[0:59:55] <alwayspronking> HYDRATE
[0:59:55] <Pookiedaexzile> Can we atleast ask the chat not to play wit keyboards?

[1:01:36] <%UrsulaCat> Don't bully woolie
[1:01:37] <+Koopert_> That would work.There's enough of us to increase the chance. It works on Fortnite for scrims and such! @WoolieVersus
[1:01:40] <+Pariah6950> @Joestar1890 You did get to see them, from the cockpit. And when you were the victim, you'd have your camera ripped out of the cockpit and held in a titan's hand

[1:02:36] <mike0dude> hows the stream going
[1:02:55] <+Pariah6950> The funniest part is, both games that TF2 refers to are some of the best FPSes out there. You can't go wrong with TF2
[1:02:55] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> look its the famous Mike0Dude form Mike0Dude dotcom

[1:06:33] <+bacon___lord> the sharks are all thats left
[1:06:33] <Josef_Stryker> 6-4's A FAMILY
[1:06:37] <AFlyingTaco1> On PC, sure. But on PS4 at least it's not like that.
[1:06:42] <%UrsulaCat> play with yourself
[1:06:45] <teflonbilly777> Woolie likes to play with himself
[1:06:49] <lewdskeletor13> I love playing with myself
[1:06:50] <Josef_Stryker> Glad to see Woolie is representing best team Kappa
[1:06:50] <$Superdandy96> When’s WoolieVs Max? Kappa
[1:06:52] <%UrsulaCat> hih
[1:07:07] <+Pariah6950> I'd figure with the new Apex crowd, there's probably less beasts out there
[1:07:07] <hy93rion> of course the match that works is the one I miss lol
[1:07:08] <%GarbageNirvana> Wonder if there's gonna be anything in these maps I can recognize from Apex
[1:07:13] <lewdskeletor13> I like that most of us made the same shitty joke LUL
[1:07:18] <%fFailureatlife> cant you?
[1:07:18] <MavMarsh> can you still grapple with the flag
[1:07:18] <Smitteys867> you can cook grenades
[1:07:22] <+Shampoohyay> you totally can lol
[1:07:25] <Tucker0603> you can
[1:07:25] <+darkmithrionx> Git gud
[1:07:26] <JohnRadical> @superdandy96 well you know how the MK9 300 challenge went
[1:07:26] <+Shampoohyay> it's one of the easiest way to get kills
[1:07:27] <%GohanEgret> @Superdandy96 max gonna give it to him Kappa
[1:07:27] <%fFailureatlife> pfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffft
[1:07:29] <%fatal_penguin_> Fry em, cook em in a stew
[1:07:31] <+TaifuDragon> @WoolieVersus you can
[1:07:34] <+TaifuDragon> only the frag though
[1:07:34] <%CptnCampy61> I remember not liking this level for some reason. Just never did as well
[1:07:41] <+Rorysaur_> CTF should be pretty solid
[1:07:53] <dabirSA> surely the rest of you hear that echo now, it's huge
[1:07:54] <lewdskeletor13> Man I’ve had JSR music stuck in my head
[1:07:55] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Low population, until Woolie populates it with killers
[1:07:56] <dabirSA> it can't just be me
[1:07:59] <JohnRadical> CTF, classic game mode
[1:08:06] <RealPT1> ctf and last titan feel like the most competitive modes
[1:08:07] <JohnRadical> Takes me back
[1:08:08] <+Shampoohyay> there's definitely an echo on the game audio and skull, yeah
[1:08:11] <+FuhrerVonZephyr> Dude, all the ctf guys are probably hardcore as hell
[1:08:26] <dabirSA> I'm not hearing an echo on skull but the echo on the game is is real bad
[1:08:28] <+PeppermintSteve> Jesus I forgot how fast this game was. Love it
[1:08:39] <%Solidnick18> oh
[1:08:44] <RealPT1> or at least have the best ways to direct game flow
[1:08:51] <Josef_Stryker> Tsk tsk Woolie doesn't know how to bunny hop Kappa
[1:08:57] <megan0va1> ye who put the big ass delay effect on the game
[1:09:01] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> SMRT Pistols
[1:09:13] <%fatal_penguin_> Unsuscribe from Super Bunny Hop? What?
[1:09:17] <+Erogon2001> Watching my friend medical cocaine
[1:09:20] <lewdskeletor13> Titanfall 3 will introduce the Kaiju
[1:09:34] <$Superdandy96> The only thing missing in this is the ability to so Wrestling moves on enemy titans BibleThump
[1:09:41] <+ThatButler> They have that
[1:09:48] <NoirePanzer> FeelsBadMan Titanfall 3 years from now
[1:09:49] <megan0va1> @josef_stryker itS CAlLed sLIdehOppINg
[1:09:49] <EnderGamma> ^
[1:09:49] <+ThatButler> You melee a doomed titan,
[1:09:51] <MavMarsh> skilled
[1:09:52] <Josef_Stryker> @lewdskeletor13 That would actually be the sickest and now u made me sad since we won't be getting Titanfall 3 for a while I can imagine
[1:09:52] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Titanfall 3 better have playable Hatsune Miku, they can only blueball us for so long
[1:09:57] <cool_culainn> What? We Unsubbing from bunny hop? Again??
[1:10:04] <Raztron> Titanfall 1 had wyverns
[1:10:13] <%Delta_X7> ayyy double kill
[1:10:14] <c_haro> l

[1:10:40] <lewdskeletor13> ohhhhh baby a triple
[1:10:44] <%CptnCampy61> You didn’t return it
[1:10:47] <JohnRadical> I’m never going to satisfied until I’m able to throw a lighting spear at a dragon as a titan
[1:10:47] <Mechanical_Mayhem> Forgot how much I loved this game, too bad I only have it on Xbox lytNOTIKETHIS
[1:10:48] <megan0va1> yeah for sure
[1:10:51] <+OranHexthief> it is a little odd they made an entire game around one faction from the universe
[1:11:00] <%fatal_penguin_> Fuck off Gates, fight with us
[1:11:01] <+Shampoohyay> OH MAN I LOVE THIS BUG
[1:11:02] <%yeknomlive> but then comes the tie breaker

[1:11:16] <$HentaiSenpai9K> I'm terrible at every FPS, EXCEPT when I play CTF. I dunno why I just turn on whenever I play that mode and almost always want n.

[1:11:58] <%Zebroneath> Wow, never seen this bug before. Is it PC exclusive?
[1:11:59] <bleugh> does this game still have players on PC
[1:12:00] <lewdskeletor13> Make the sounds for us Woolie! @woolieversus
[1:12:03] <joylent_blue> i liked chat sfx FeelsBadMan

[1:12:14] <EnderGamma> shiboingiii dooof
[1:12:17] <%king_wragles> weird, it was like I got kicked from the stream. Couldn't see chat or anything.
[1:12:19] <MavMarsh> is dat some holo pilot
[1:12:21] <Raztron> I really hope the spinoff for this year or later is Titan only
[1:12:21] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Audio's back but we can still hear Woolie Jobbing as usual Kappa
[1:12:22] <Th47guy> This is a test chat for 0 dollars.
[1:12:22] <alwayspronking> @joylent_blue don't worry, it doesn't stop you from singing along
[1:12:29] <+Pariah6950> My favorite thing about Apex is that new shotgun in that game might one day be in Titanfall 3
[1:12:32] <+Shampoohyay> @Zebroneath i'm not certain, but it's very consistently an issue with half time
[1:12:40] <StooEsq> I wonder if that bug is a Source engine thing, even though this is running on a heavily modified Source engine
[1:12:40] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:12:44] <JohnRadical> I actually wanna to an LP where all the sound effects are just replaced with random live stream chat messages.
[1:12:46] <Greywolf47> even though the sound is back can you still make noises with your mouth?
[1:12:47] <joylent_blue> !MOTIVATED
[1:12:47] <@Moobot> 159 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[1:12:47] <+Shampoohyay> i want to say i found the cause ages ago when it first came up but i don't remember
[1:12:47] <%king_wragles> @Th47guy were you kinda not in the chat too?
[1:12:48] <lewdskeletor13> So Apex is in this same universe yeah?
[1:12:55] <megan0va1> yeah
[1:12:56] <%GarbageNirvana> @lewdskeletor13 Yup
[1:12:58] <+TaifuDragon> same universe
[1:13:00] <NoirePanzer> Apex is a few hundred years after or something like that
[1:13:04] <Raztron> @Pariah6950 all that stuff was made for Titanfall 3 man
[1:13:04] <JohnRadical> Easy mode has been unlocked for you.
[1:13:08] <%Jensegaense> naw like 20 years after 2
[1:13:19] <+Pariah6950> @Raztron If there's a Titanfall 3
[1:13:21] <+Yokuho> Good effort
[1:13:22] <+TotallyJustBacon> its 30 years
[1:13:26] <%GarbageNirvana> If it was hundreds of years after then Kuben Blisk somehow discovered immortality
[1:13:27] <T4silly> Mines!
[1:13:32] <Raztron> it got turned into Apex dude
[1:13:37] <+Cthulos> trip laser
[1:13:38] <lewdskeletor13> NotLikeThis how many years tho
[1:13:38] <%fFailureatlife> it was a tripwire lul
[1:13:40] <%Ariksgabs> so were Titans decommisioned in the Apex timeline or something?
[1:13:41] <Raztron> its what happened
[1:13:42] <nomad390> you ran into a trip mine
[1:13:45] <AFlyingTaco1> Yeyeye Ion is top tier god waifu
[1:13:46] <+Shampoohyay> apex is 30 years later
[1:13:56] <T_Sasquatch> 3
[1:13:57] <masterfire23> man all these pc players with their high refresh monitor a and expensive mice Kappa
[1:14:00] <Raztron> @Ariksgabs Titans are military gear
[1:14:00] <%Zebroneath> Also, this stream won't be complete till we see and "OraOraOra" execution. LUL
[1:14:03] <%Jensegaense> Apex is a gameshow-ish thing within the universe
[1:14:07] <cool_culainn> Naw. Titans are synced to pilots and none of the apex guys are pilots
[1:14:08] <MavMarsh> gotta stand on it
[1:14:12] <Raztron> not for broadcast blood sports
[1:14:16] <+Shampoohyay> honestly the actual lore of apex is really vague
[1:14:18] <$Superdandy96> Titan fall 3 will include a dating function for your mech. Get better upgrades by porking your mech Kappa
[1:14:19] <+alpacasintophats> you must stand on the flag to return it
[1:14:23] <RyuuAoi> Woolie single handedly reviving TF2. Go head, Woolie!
[1:14:23] <+Shampoohyay> probably on purpose to leave room for titanfall 3's story
[1:14:29] <+Shampoohyay> we know the war is over, but we don't know who won or how
[1:14:35] <mightyfat> YOU! Dig! Giant robots!
[1:14:42] <%GohanEgret> SPLAT
[1:14:44] <%yeknomlive> lol
[1:14:45] <%GarbageNirvana> Merc'd
[1:14:46] <joylent_blue> jesus pvpBoom
[1:14:48] <MavMarsh> auto scorch has the sickest aim
[1:14:49] <%Ariksgabs> ooohhh so they simply stopped using Titans
[1:14:49] <mightyfat> I! Dig! Giant robots!
[1:14:50] <the_solarflare> jumped right in front of the big ass cannon, classic
[1:14:53] <+gutlesscoward> is this apex legends
[1:14:54] <JohnRadical> @superdandy96 now that’s thinking like a gripe
[1:14:54] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Good job fighting the Titan bro
[1:14:56] <+Shampoohyay> there's IMC hardware in Apex, so they probably still EXIST somehow but that's all we really know
[1:15:09] <mightyfat> WE! Dig! Giant robots!
[1:15:10] <+TaifuDragon> IMC exists but not on the frontier
[1:15:10] <+Cthulos> Not everyone in the TF universe is a Pilot
[1:15:10] <%king_wragles> @WoolieVersus isn't dying for a flag return worth it?
[1:15:17] <+Cthulos> they're like jedi
[1:15:18] <Raztron> The super Earth Megacorp just got kicked out of the solar system for Titanfall 2
[1:15:19] <aimlesshealer> Show me ya moves!
[1:15:20] <MonstarGrrrl> you can do it woolie :)
[1:15:22] <masterfire23> @woolieversus do it for BT BibleThump 7
[1:15:23] <+Pariah6950> Let's be real? Does anyone care about the greater story or worldbuilding of Titanfall? Or do we just love dat gameplay and BT?
[1:15:27] <+TaifuDragon> Bangalore is an IMC soldier who needs to get back to IMC space
[1:15:31] <Raztron> they can still come back
[1:15:35] <%king_wragles> @Cthulos it felt more like Mechwarrior pilots to me.
[1:15:36] <+TaifuDragon> I like the greater story and worldbuilding
[1:15:39] <T4silly> @pariah6950 Yes. We care.
[1:15:41] <RyuuAoi> We COD Bros? BLASPHEMY. We TF MERCS
[1:15:46] <lewdskeletor13> I’ve heard the lore is cool
[1:15:47] <Mexicanskydiver> Hey can anyone here help me out with an issue im running into titanfall 2 and origin. It recognizes my mic but no signal is going through
[1:15:49] <+ThatGuyfromMars> CHICKS! DlG! GlANT ROBOTS! @mightyfat
[1:15:49] <AFlyingTaco1> @Pariah6950 Titanfall 2's campaign is more than enough to draw most people in
[1:15:51] <generalve> capture the flasg is whack
[1:15:59] <T4silly> I'm sad Apex shits all over it quick.
[1:16:04] <+SashaStarshine> @ThatGuyfromMars Nice
[1:16:06] <+Cthulos> well pilots can do wallrunning and all that stuff
[1:16:24] <%yeknomlive> ctf in this game is actually mirror's edge with guns
[1:16:24] <joylent_blue> pvpBoom pvpBoom pvpBoom
[1:16:27] <Raztron> @Pariah6950 yes we do be cause Respawn includes aliens and giant monsters with the mechas
[1:16:27] <%fFailureatlife> @Pariah6950 i care
[1:16:47] <RadRetroRider> woolie can you love me
[1:16:49] <tearknack> @WoolieVersus cheerleader
[1:16:52] <The_Dudde> hey dad
[1:16:56] <%king_wragles> Ya, the pilots are special. But are they special because 'magic'/plot or is it from super elite training?
[1:17:00] <$Superdandy96> @t4silly watch the story for Titanfall3 be against Kaijus because we’re invading on their land Kappa
[1:17:00] <cool_culainn> @pariah6950 I think the lore is pretty cool
[1:17:01] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Can you jack Titans
[1:17:03] <%Typhaeon> PogChamp
[1:17:04] <joylent_blue> PogChamp
[1:17:05] <%king_wragles> Magic might be the wrong word to use, hence the quotes.
[1:17:06] <Raztron> alternate timelines and dimensions with simulacrum
[1:17:06] <+Cthulos> @thatguyfrommars do they though
[1:17:08] <Josef_Stryker> PogChamp
[1:17:08] <+Shampoohyay> big saves
[1:17:08] <%Ariksgabs> PogChamp
[1:17:08] <+KuroNekoVamp> Wow
[1:17:09] <%SilvaChariot0133> PogChamp
[1:17:11] <RyuuAoi> Woolie, stick with your squad. Two heads are better than...well you know.
[1:17:22] <The_Dudde> what he playing this on
[1:17:23] <+Pariah6950> Fair enough. In my time with the campaign, I thought the set pieces and levels were cool. But I really had no sense of or interest in what this war was actually about
[1:17:25] <+SashaStarshine> @Cthulos The good ones do
[1:17:30] <Greywolf47> PogChamp
[1:17:31] <NoirePanzer> BRRRRRT the drop ship
[1:17:31] <$FuqBoiSlim> @the_dudde PC
[1:17:32] <RyuuAoi> @the_dudde PC
[1:17:40] <The_Dudde> ok good shit
[1:17:43] <+ThatGuyfromMars> @Cthulos I dunno, I was just quoting the Megas XLR theme that mightyfat was doing
[1:17:44] <AFlyingTaco1> @king_wragles It's from training and (I think) surgery
[1:17:45] <%fatal_penguin_> Be careful. Theres two of us in here now, remember
[1:17:45] <+Cthulos> sure but they're still pretty niche
[1:17:52] <T_Sasquatch> i wish this game had a sabotage class, i loved fucking with peoples titans and stealing their shit
[1:17:57] <%zeroarturia> Woah
[1:18:04] <Josef_Stryker> LUL
[1:18:08] <%king_wragles> @AFlyingTaco1 okay, so it's kinda like Mechwarrior
[1:18:14] <JohnRadical> @woolieversus have you ever played any of the old Halo games before?
[1:18:17] <lewdskeletor13> LUL
[1:18:20] <+Cthulos> I wish I could find a girl that loves giant robutts and monsters
[1:18:27] <krymzen5> this game deserved a better life
[1:18:30] <Raztron> My favorite aspect of the Titanfal lore is that it takes place in some random solar system far away from Earth
[1:18:36] <%Ariksgabs> Man seeing Titans in matches again I completely understand why Woolie reacted the way he did during the No Titanfall 3 news
[1:18:39] <T_Sasquatch> @Cthulos CHICKS LOVE GIANT ROBOTS
[1:18:40] <lewdskeletor13> @cthulos You will eventually!
[1:18:41] <%king_wragles> TF being like Mechwarrior (lore wise... kinda) is a fairly big sell to me tbh
[1:18:43] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> 45 mins is everything you need
[1:18:46] <TwinBat> i miss combat evolved
[1:18:48] <+ThatGuyfromMars> Other than cool robots @Raztron
[1:18:53] <dragoon001914> Co-op Halo with Pat
[1:18:55] <+SashaStarshine> I miss Halo 3
[1:18:59] <RyuuAoi> Wait...Woolie never played Halo 3 multiplayer????
[1:19:00] <+oweniguess> I think you'll love Halo 1 through Reach Woolie
[1:19:01] <Ignorableartist> gg woolie
[1:19:06] <stropbopadopolis> halo 3 was the fps
[1:19:07] <%Ariksgabs> at the very least something that came out of Titanfall is beating Fortnite in popularity
[1:19:07] <%GohanEgret> @king_wragles long live the capellan confederation
[1:19:07] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Metroid Prime is the real FPS
[1:19:10] <EVA_Unit02> LASO LP with Pat
[1:19:10] <TheNeedlesD> MCC finally works if'n you wanna play it
[1:19:12] <masterfire23> I played halo combat evolved lan games in my school computer lab
[1:19:12] <%Solidnick18> I loved halo reach
[1:19:15] <+WhyIDie> man, if they put mirror's edge gameplay elements into metroid prime...
[1:19:17] <lewdskeletor13> Reach was my favorite growing up
[1:19:19] <+ThatGuyfromMars> man I was a playstation guy so I missed out on halo
[1:19:21] <+oweniguess> I think you'd really like ODST
[1:19:21] <%fatal_penguin_> Halo Reach was the SHIT
[1:19:22] <T4silly> @woolieversus Whens the Metroid Prime Multiplayer Stream?
[1:19:26] <+Pariah6950> It's fine. Titanfall 2 is all you need
[1:19:28] <%Zebroneath> I would assume Bioshock 1 as well.
[1:19:30] <Greywolf47> the custom games of halo were fun
[1:19:31] <The_Dudde> fallout skyrim?
[1:19:31] <Sloavon> halo 2, 3 and Reach are the shit
[1:19:36] <EVA_Unit02> ODST was comfy AF
[1:19:37] <danknugglit> Combat evolved was my jam
[1:19:38] <RyuuAoi> Goldeneye all you REALLY need though!
[1:19:38] <TEEron11> woolie was playing apex?
[1:19:41] <$HentaiSenpai9K> You should stream Halo 1 thru 3. Good stream games
[1:19:41] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:19:41] <fairore> @whyidie that would be interesting
[1:19:43] <Raztron> Metroid Prime trilogy and then the Halo trilogy woolie
[1:19:44] <+Rorysaur_> Bounty hunt or CTF are pretty good
[1:19:46] <krymzen5> i got my og xbox on christmas day with a copy of halo 1
[1:19:51] <dabirSA> woolie your game audio has a horrendous echo
[1:19:57] <stropbopadopolis> 3 and odst firefight Kreygasm
[1:20:02] <+Cthulos> ODST is best Halo game, don't come @ me
[1:20:04] <%oweniguess> whoever said do halo co op with pat is a genius
[1:20:07] <+nameless_majin> @woolieversus serious question. is Castle Auper Beast only meant to be just for podcasts or do you see it evolving into a new LP channel with Pat?
[1:20:09] <+gutlesscoward> I wish EA wasn't involved in this game, I'd have bought it then.
[1:20:10] <london_flexing> Dunkey's new vid tho
[1:20:11] <+JacktheMan18> "begone white cic male"
[1:20:12] <giogio346> skulls mic is a bit too loud
[1:20:14] <MavMarsh> if you join a low pop playlist you will almost definitely get SBFP players
[1:20:22] <+Pariah6950> Metroid Prime 2 multipalyer is what all the cool kids were playing
[1:20:23] <The_Dudde> halo reach gave the best memories for me
[1:20:25] <RyuuAoi> @oweniguess Or Gears?
[1:20:31] <dabirSA> @WoolieVersus your game audio has had an echo this whole time, it got really bad that last game
[1:20:31] <+nameless_majin> @woolieversus Castle Super Beast*
[1:20:33] <%oweniguess> I would love to see Woolie play halo, I feel like he'd love Jorge from reach
[1:20:34] <fairore> @whyidie would to that be a zero suit segement
[1:20:43] <%GohanEgret> @nameless_majin its basically the podcast with special occasion LPs
[1:20:45] <%oweniguess> @RyuuAoi That'd be cool too
[1:20:45] <fairore> section*
[1:20:47] <%fFailureatlife> woolie pls
[1:20:47] <stropbopadopolis> im suprised at the reach love
[1:20:49] <+Cthulos> Reach is a good one too
[1:20:52] <+ThatGuyfromMars> @nameless_majin Pat actually answered that he wouldn't do another LP channel on Youtube because of all the bs that's happening on there lately, but pat said he would guest on woolie's streams
[1:21:01] <+WhyIDie> @fairore yeah, they seem to be tryin to expand on the combat in the other metroids, like other m and samus returns, but mirror's edge mechanics could be built in to buff up exploration
[1:21:12] <EVA_Unit02> Emile is best boy
[1:21:13] <T4silly> Try Frontier Defense!
[1:21:18] <gryffinp> Amped Hardpoint SUUUUUCKS thouigh
[1:21:20] <+Rorysaur_> Bounty hunt is basically attrition
[1:21:24] <Sloavon> Emile is black
[1:21:25] <RykerSkies> @WoolieVersus you're a rock, You and the guys helped me through some shit. I appreciate you mang. Keep doing you. bitterKiss
[1:21:26] <+Rorysaur_> ... kind of
[1:21:26] <Raztron> Bounty Hunt is fun
[1:21:28] <RyuuAoi> Woolie telling us to play the game but he don't know how do game Keepo
[1:21:29] <%ImperiusMex> then skullgod doesnt need to be there doodBenny woolieMIRIN
[1:21:30] <%fatal_penguin_> I do miss the easy watchable LP's on Youtube,but I try to catch streams when I can
[1:21:32] <+Stratiotai2> is he playin pc or xbone
[1:21:33] <+purps26> he's just saying play something other than the most popular mode so you have a better chance of matching with other people in your network
[1:21:34] <cool_culainn> Bounty is great
[1:21:34] <T4silly> @woolieversus FRONTIER DEFENSE
[1:21:35] <dabirSA> woolie your game audio is echoing like a motherfucker
[1:21:37] <%fFailureatlife> hardpoint is pretty fun
[1:21:37] <Raztron> ye just a different flavor of Attrition
[1:21:45] <Raztron> dont have to be the best with pilot kills
[1:21:49] <JohnRadical> @woolieversus continuing off on the Halo stuff, you want to see if you would be interested into old Halo? Listen to “Finish The Fight” OST. Old Halo has the best music I’ve heard in 18 years of playing games.
[1:21:51] <+nameless_majin> @thatguyfrommars That's fantastic. although I miss the high light cuts edits that SBF did for their LP's I still do rather enjoy Woolie and Pat doing LP's
[1:21:54] <$Superdandy96> Horde mode is my favorite!
[1:21:58] <%fFailureatlife> CAUSE ITS FUN
[1:22:00] <Raztron> just get money from grunts
[1:22:06] <+Cthulos> I loved Team Fortress 2 as an FPS. That was my jam
[1:22:09] <%GlewmanIII> fucking gottem
[1:22:14] <T4silly> What! Frontier Defense is awesome!
[1:22:14] <AFlyingTaco1> Nah Frontier Defense is fun though
[1:22:19] <%oweniguess> BibleThump
[1:22:26] <%Zebroneath> Pat did also say that the DMC5 would be a proper, reccorded LP. Outside that, primarily sticking to their own stuff with occasional guest appearances on Woolie's channel.
[1:22:30] <+FuhrerVonZephyr> Bah, I didn't get in
[1:22:31] <MavMarsh> helps you get acclimated to movement and stuff without getting blown up by sharks
[1:22:36] <RyuuAoi> He don't like it. That's it!
[1:22:38] <+ThatGuyfromMars> @nameless_majin I hear you, maybe the people who enjoy pat's and woolie's streams will do highlights and stuff
[1:22:39] <42nfl19> What is there playlist?
[1:22:48] <MavMarsh> hardpoint
[1:22:48] <cosmicdischarge> @WoolieVersus Will you ever play borderlands games ?
[1:22:51] <masterfire23> halo 2 theme Kreygasm
[1:23:07] <+Cthulos> If you think about it, they're still a loose zaibatsu sbfpLiam
[1:23:07] <+SashaStarshine> I want Master Chief in smash
[1:23:07] <RyuuAoi> We respect your tastes, Woolie
[1:23:13] <The_Dudde> waddup with the other guys speech
[1:23:15] <$HentaiSenpai9K> But....who will stop the Covenant then?
[1:23:17] <+Cthulos> think about it
[1:23:22] <T_Sasquatch> Audio sounds weirdddd
[1:23:24] <%fatal_penguin_> The Halo 2 End Credit theme is my fav
[1:23:25] <+ThatGuyfromMars> I hate that I love Apex Legends, but I wanna hug Pathfinder and I'm always at a conflict
[1:23:25] <%GlewmanIII> cant believe skull denied me
[1:23:26] <fairore> @sashastarshine i hate you
[1:23:30] <%GlewmanIII> this is oppression
[1:23:35] <RyuuAoi> @sashastarshine YOOOO. And with the new partnership...
[1:23:39] <%oweniguess> Im really liking the RE2 playthrough
[1:23:40] <justachap> Wonder if any Aussies are still playing this
[1:23:44] <+ORGANizerC> ok so we're just playing hard point?
[1:23:46] <+Koopert_> Look at the body lean, he's so immersed
[1:23:48] <+nameless_majin> @thatguyfrommars hopefully. But I'm actually excited to see how much praise @woolieversus is going to do for DMC5 on the pod cast I can only imagine that essay he'll write for why it's the GOAT lol
[1:23:55] <Raztron> ye with the japanese justachap
[1:23:58] <generalve> i didnt get in
[1:23:59] <dabirSA> turn 270 degrees right instead of turning left then
[1:24:01] <bleugh> just play with mouse Kappa
[1:24:04] <%Ariksgabs> is your controller Zoolander or something?
[1:24:09] <Raztron> they been keeping it alive all these years on PS4
[1:24:12] <%fatal_penguin_> Drew Barrymore
[1:24:12] <JohnRadical> Man. Never thought I would get a definitive answer on the Halo stuff. Thanks man. Been wondering if you tried the games before for years now.
[1:24:19] <%GohanEgret> oh man it's domination from black ops, I lived in that mode back in 2010/2011
[1:24:27] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Aus here, still play after work trying to g5 everything
[1:24:30] <RyuuAoi> DEAD
[1:24:36] <+ThatGuyfromMars> @nameless_majin well Pat and Woolie are gonna be doing DMC5 together so hopefully it'll just be a jerkfest for it
[1:24:51] <+mechslayer71> The alternator isn’t shit in this game?! PogChamp
[1:24:56] <Raztron> lol
[1:24:57] <+nameless_majin> OH HELL YES
[1:25:01] <Raztron> its great
[1:25:08] <Josef_Stryker> ORANGE BOIS
[1:25:09] <+SashaStarshine> Mjolnir Mix, Warthog Run, Tip of the Spear and Behold a Pale Horse are all good songs but Deference to Darkness is underrated as hell
[1:25:14] <Idon__> daily reminder that the p20XX guns are named after titanfall release dates and in Apex it's called p2020.
[1:25:15] <RyuuAoi> @thatguyfrommars When's 2 doe?
[1:25:18] <+Cthulos> @mechslayer71 Yeah, the guns got super rebalanced for Apex
[1:25:19] <+MrFlyingMongoose123> I'm glad Woolie plays as big daddy Legion
[1:25:26] <%fatal_penguin_> #Echo419 #NeverForget
[1:25:28] <+ThatGuyfromMars> wat @RyuuAoi
[1:25:38] <+Cthulos> Mozambique was decent in TF|2
[1:25:41] <+Detectivemac9> @mechslayer71 alternator is arguably the best gun in the game in this game

[1:26:37] <Tucker0603> was worth it
[1:26:39] <+Detectivemac9> @mechslayer71 you'll find matches. it's obviously not like overwatch or apex alive, but i'd say give it a try either way, campaign's good too
[1:26:54] <%Zebroneath> @mechslayer71 Player base on PS4 (tonight, anyway) is 4500.
[1:26:54] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games

[1:27:03] <+SashaStarshine> @JohnRadical Makes it even worse how badly Bungie fucked over Martie after Destiny 1

[1:27:15] <+mechslayer71> @pariah6950 Ps4
[1:27:19] <+Detectivemac9> game is best on PC, most populated on consoles- i'd say you owe it to yourself to try it on PC at least once, it's the best
[1:27:39] <+Pariah6950> @mechslayer71 That's your second best choice for player count
[1:27:43] <Raztron> @mechslayer71 yea PS4 is always active for multiplayer
[1:27:48] <JohnRadical> @sashastarshine yeah lost my shit when I first heard about it.
[1:28:08] <puhff> God this looks sooo much more fun than Apex
[1:28:14] <+Detectivemac9> @SashaStarshine to be fair marty did kind of make a HUGE scene over activision fucking over his score, but all the same
[1:28:20] <Godplayz_1> Does he ever aim

[1:28:45] <+Shotgundam009> same
[1:28:45] <+Pariah6950> I don't know about KB/M being the way to play. I feel being able to move in more than 8 directions might be more important for a game so movement heavy
[1:28:48] <+Shotgundam009> Salud
[1:28:48] <+Shampoohyay> if you mean literally go into ADS, he shouldn't be lol
[1:28:52] <Raztron> Never ads for alternator
[1:28:58] <%Solidnick18> yooo
[1:29:00] <RyuuAoi> Woolie, need more Gundam FNF
[1:29:02] <JohnRadical> Funny story about a small youtube channel: this guy has been making music for Installation 01 and one day he released this screenshot of his subscriber list and in it was Martin O’donnell.
[1:29:03] <+Shampoohyay> you can move in way more than 8 directions with a keyboard in this game lol
[1:29:05] <+Shampoohyay> you have a mouse
[1:29:06] <Raztron> gotta be moving and shootin
[1:29:08] <cool_culainn> Aiming with alternator Kappa
[1:29:09] <MavMarsh> the heck is that aim sensitivity
[1:29:10] <%badmr7> oh yeah that was bad
[1:29:13] <%Zebroneath> Oh yeah, that's no bueno
[1:29:14] <+Detectivemac9> @Pariah6950 the movement is really dependent on camera movement, so for that you need mouse movement.
[1:29:14] <krymzen5> the mouse wool
[1:29:21] <$GoogleyGareth> oof
[1:29:25] <+Yokuho> The thing wrong with your controller is that it isn't a mouse and keyboard
[1:29:26] <Josef_Stryker> @Pariah6950 I think it's just a choice of whether u prefer precision vs movement.
[1:29:29] <+TotallyJustBacon> turn right to go left woolz
[1:29:39] <+Cthulos> Is alternator still alright for spray fire in Apex? I never fooled around with it
[1:29:40] <BootyManeOW> nice
[1:29:46] <+Lieutori> Just increase sensitivity and only turn right
[1:29:46] <RyuuAoi> Check those corners!
[1:29:53] <%GohanEgret> RaccAttack
[1:30:00] <+Shampoohyay> in terms of movement, the main caveat with a controller is just the lack of buttons and how you really need to rejigger your controls to comfortably maneuver at your best
[1:30:01] <+Pariah6950> @Detectivemac9 Not really. You don't need to be precise with your camera to influence your movement
[1:30:03] <Josef_Stryker> But Titanfall is one of those games where both are perfectly viable
[1:30:05] <+Shampoohyay> ie switching to bumper jumper
[1:30:09] <%fatal_penguin_> @Cthulos Alternator is good for spray in Apex and close range, thats about it
[1:30:10] <+Shampoohyay> @Pariah6950 you most certainly do, what
[1:30:15] <+Detectivemac9> @Pariah6950 for stuff like bhopping and grappling? yeah you do
[1:30:17] <+mechslayer71> @ @cthulos dont, it’s trash. Much better off with R99 for a close range SMG
[1:30:19] <RyuuAoi> This needs to be on Switch...
[1:30:21] <$TRILLTURBAN> did my man just bump fire an alternator? that almost forgives him choosing stim over grappling hook
[1:30:22] <+Shampoohyay> the entire basis of good grapple flinging is dependent on good look control
[1:30:32] <masterfire23> the aim lock seems pretty generous for the controller
[1:30:35] <$Superdandy96> Chat, don’t you get it? Woolie’s playing on controller because he’s purposely handicapping himself. Kappa
[1:30:42] <+Shampoohyay> aim assist is very forgiving in titanfall, yeah
[1:30:42] <puhff> Any chance we could see some of the campaign later?
[1:30:47] <T4silly> You guys clearly haven't seen people like GAMESAGER move with a controller then.
[1:30:51] <+mugwugsampoo> Switch being able to handle this game LUL
[1:31:01] <+Shampoohyay> one guy can move well with a controller, yes
[1:31:06] <+Detectivemac9> @Shampoohyay not to mention air strafing
[1:31:06] <MavMarsh> woolie's already done an lp
[1:31:06] <+Shampoohyay> (also, frankly, gamesager's a shitter)
[1:31:07] <+SashaStarshine> @Superdandy96 Woolie is gonna drop the controller on the floor like Rock Lee's ankle weights
[1:31:08] <+Pariah6950> @Detectivemac9 Well, as someone who plays PC with controller, I think you can hold your own just as well if you're good
[1:31:13] <JohnRadical> @superdandy96 just watch Woolie get serious and take out a arcade controller XD
[1:31:14] <+Shampoohyay> that doesn't mean it's optimal at all
[1:31:17] <Raztron> Pat and woolie did a whole LP of campaign
[1:31:22] <+Shampoohyay> people can play fighting games with guitar hero controllers
[1:31:28] <+Shampoohyay> does that mean everyone should use a guitar hero controller
[1:31:28] <+JacktheMan18> Yo that was a sick kill PogChamp
[1:31:39] <T_Sasquatch> R O N I N
[1:31:43] <rsg220> Woolie smiles everytime he's in a Legion
[1:31:45] <MavMarsh> GET SMART
[1:31:46] <+Detectivemac9> i mean frankly you don't NEED movement in titanfall to do well, it's just way more fun
[1:31:47] <Tucker0603> someone clip my death
[1:31:50] <RyuuAoi> @mugwugsampoo Switch could handle it. Even at only 1% power!
[1:31:53] <+Shampoohyay> yeah lol
[1:31:54] <+alpacasintophats> SMART UP DAMMIT
[1:31:54] <+Pariah6950> Fair point. Might just be that I am so much more accustomed to controller
[1:31:54] <%Jensegaense> Woolie not using Legion's Ult is maddening
[1:31:54] <Ferakin> Guitar Hero controllers aren't pro tier
[1:31:56] <RunningNGunning> Played that entire game without seeing Woolie once LUL
[1:31:58] <%Zebroneath> @puhff Woolie has already done an LP with AngriestPat back when they were in the Super Best Friends Play youtube channel.
[1:32:00] <Th47guy> USE YOUR CORE
[1:32:01] <+Shampoohyay> you can totally just sit behind an AWall with a spitfire
[1:32:01] <Ferakin> Banana controllers are where its at
[1:32:06] <+Shampoohyay> bonus points for aim assist carrying you
[1:32:09] <Raztron> why the heck aint the core on bro
[1:32:15] <JohnRadical> Pros play on rock band drums!
[1:32:15] <Josef_Stryker> Hey Number 2 SeemsGood
[1:32:17] <+Cthulos> I would like to see someone go Superhuman Samurai Syber Squad on Titanfall 2 and play with a guitar controller
[1:32:17] <$Superdandy96> @johnradical BRAH, Woolie instant no scope headshot with a pad, don’t even joke Kappa
[1:32:21] <Raztron> why Legion if ya aint gonna use aimbot
[1:32:30] <%Jensegaense> Bad
[1:32:34] <+Shampoohyay> phase rewind sucks
[1:32:35] <$TRILLTURBAN> meh
[1:32:35] <Neo_Kaiser> Woolies only level 45?
[1:32:36] <Th47guy> I'm already tracer.
[1:32:36] <%Solidnick18> it's bad
[1:32:40] <SchlongKongEduardo> ass
[1:32:40] <%Jensegaense> Phase rewind is the worst use in my opinion
[1:32:42] <+Shampoohyay> for some reason unlike holo nova it doesn't activate instantly
[1:32:47] <+Detectivemac9> phase rewind is terrible but i use it anyway
[1:32:50] <%Solidnick18> i tried i couldn't get the hang of it
[1:32:52] <+Shampoohyay> so you can't rely on using it on reaction
[1:32:55] <JohnRadical> @superdandy96 “Congrats, you made me use 10% of my true power”

[1:35:11] <ghostravens> i stopped playing before monarch got introduced. is she good?
[1:35:11] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> when did everyone stop using tone and why didnt I make it past that point
[1:35:15] <JohnRadical> Please give a quick thank to Halo CE for creating aim assist.
[1:35:17] <42nfl19> nope,well next time
[1:35:29] <ravencloak13> I honestly hate Ronin’s shotgun. It’s swords better.
[1:35:29] <EX_Luck_Icarus> monarch is pretty legit tbh.
[1:35:34] <cool_culainn> I play ronin with the anime skin exclusively and I have no regrets
[1:35:35] <masterfire23> @johnradical Ha
[1:35:36] <thegoblinslayer666> BernieSanders2020 Reddit Rise Up!
[1:35:45] <+JacktheMan18> Are they all playing in a private server?
[1:35:46] <EX_Luck_Icarus> the upgrading mechanics is super sick
[1:35:48] <+Detectivemac9> fighting monarch as a pilot makes me want to die
[1:35:52] <+PanFro_Games> panfroMhm
[1:35:59] <+Detectivemac9> fighting monarch period makes me want to die, actually
[1:35:59] <MavMarsh> they're matchmaking now @JacktheMan18
[1:35:59] <thegoblinslayer666> I donated 27 dollars, match me!
[1:36:11] <+JacktheMan18> ah ok
[1:36:17] <T_Sasquatch> I dont think ive seen woolie aim down the sights this entire stream LUL
[1:36:18] <EX_Luck_Icarus> oh no woolie..
[1:36:30] <Raztron> NO ADS SCRUB
[1:36:35] <thegoblinslayer666> The light shines.
[1:36:35] <Raztron> BUNNY HOP AND HIPFIRE
[1:36:37] <+Detectivemac9> ADS is 100% optional with the alternatort
[1:36:42] <Raztron> Zoomers get out
[1:36:43] <T4silly> Oh dear...
[1:36:47] <cool_culainn> Ada with alternator is a bad thing
[1:36:48] <sanctified_succ> @t_sasquatch you don't ads in titanfall
[1:36:54] <ravencloak13> So show of hands, who immediately starts killing the mobs when the see their team is behind in points?
[1:37:01] <+Detectivemac9> i mean there are a few guns where you have to ADS but they're all lame
[1:37:05] <T4silly> I kill them anyway.
[1:37:05] <$Superdandy96> What Pilot class is Woolie playing? I usually use the basic or Steath one myself.
[1:37:06] <EX_Luck_Icarus> I always do that.
[1:37:06] <+hakusas> sbfpGreen
[1:37:14] <EX_Luck_Icarus> woolie is stim
[1:37:15] <cool_culainn> Here
[1:37:17] <Neo_Kaiser> I shoot the AI even when we're ahead by a hundred points.
[1:37:21] <ISkyHunterI> Is this new apex legends game mode ? PogChamp
[1:37:26] <thegoblinslayer666> Breathe deeply.
[1:37:36] <ravencloak13> Okay cool, not the only one.
[1:37:54] <SchlongKongEduardo> there we go
[1:37:55] <Raztron> Always shoot the grunts for titanfall and equipment meter
[1:37:56] <CityKani> im confus. it says PC on title but woolie is holding a pad
[1:37:58] <+Cthulos> What is the default mag capacity of alternator in Titanfall 2?
[1:38:05] <thegoblinslayer666> Let the darkness grow!
[1:38:05] <joylent_blue> CityKani thats correct
[1:38:07] <+Detectivemac9> 20 i think
[1:38:07] <+Cthulos> is it 20?
[1:38:15] <+Detectivemac9> 20->25 with extended
[1:38:18] <+Pariah6950> I have a terrible habit of completely ignoring the bots. Costs me MVP all the time
[1:38:18] <ravencloak13> But sometimes it feels like it doesn’t matter cause my team out dies the AI grunts I kill or the kill even more AI as well.
[1:38:19] <SchlongKongEduardo> LUL
[1:38:21] <sanctified_succ> 20 yes
[1:38:22] <$TRILLTURBAN> Yep
[1:38:22] <EX_Luck_Icarus> its 20, looking at it rn
[1:38:22] <+Cthulos> Thanks
[1:38:30] <%Zebroneath> Ringo Road Again would be disappointed
[1:38:39] <masterfire23> he's tracer PogChamp
[1:38:51] <Greywolf47> the better tracer
[1:39:04] <+Tuxadracles> Is this Alex Legends
[1:39:06] <+Tuxadracles> ?
[1:39:08] <Raztron> the more attractive tracer
[1:39:10] <CityKani> @joylent_blue i thought ppl were trolling when they said they play fps games on PC with a pad
[1:39:12] <haisho> OOF
[1:39:13] <ravencloak13> Runnin around at the speed of sound!
[1:39:15] <dapperskeleton69> I wAnnA bE TRaCeR
[1:39:20] <%Zebroneath> @Tuxadracles This is Titanfall 2
[1:39:21] <%linkwolf4> lytAGH
[1:39:25] <+Tuxadracles> Is it still active?
[1:39:28] <JohnRadical> I’ll be windowmaker...
[1:39:33] <TopLeftCenter> Best part of playing Ion
[1:39:42] <ravencloak13> I either take grapple hook or stim. Got to go fast or got to catch air.
[1:39:43] <Raztron> jesus Tux is genuinely asking lol
[1:39:44] <Daiidalus> He's...He's Fast rooPog
[1:39:46] <+Tuxadracles> @zebroneath ? I thought it was Black Ops 4. FeelsBadMan
[1:39:47] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> I just got here but for the 20+th time presumably it's titanfall
[1:39:59] <+Detectivemac9> maybe it'd be more active if people stopped worrying if it were active smh
[1:40:03] <$TRILLTURBAN> nice
[1:40:06] <+Cthulos> HEIEI
[1:40:07] <+Tuxadracles> LUL I wish sarcasm could work better over twitch. Kappa
[1:40:13] <thegoblinslayer666> Thats a big robot.
[1:40:16] <thegoblinslayer666> 4U
[1:40:19] <+Pariah6950> Generally I prefer shooters on console. Makes the gameplay less focused on aim and more on other skills, such as movement
[1:40:35] <dapperskeleton69> maybe itd be more active if the ttf community actually played the game soggyEmotion
[1:40:37] <thegoblinslayer666> Was getting caught part of your plan?
[1:40:50] <%yeknomlive> man this game's fun
[1:40:51] <masterfire23> does apex have aim assist for controllers on pc too?
[1:40:57] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> yes
[1:40:57] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:40:57] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> gotta be liberal with the legion shield
[1:41:00] <thegoblinslayer666> He didn't fly so good.
[1:41:01] <+Irridium> I think so @masterfire23
[1:41:03] <$TRILLTURBAN> At least you got that grunt
[1:41:03] <Neo_Kaiser> Woolie has nuke
[1:41:09] <samiscoolbro> This is why i choose overcore
[1:41:09] <dapperskeleton69> i dont think pc has aim assistmasterfire
[1:41:15] <JohnRadical> It’s weird playing FPS on PC cause the sensitivity and precision instantly becomes so much more demanding and begins to make any game feel faster and tougher.
[1:41:16] <%Zebroneath> @Tuxadracles It's a community night for the stream, so I can't say for certain how active PC is on a daily basis. PS4 has 4500 tonight though, if that answers your question.
[1:41:18] <thegoblinslayer666> Dr Pavel I'm CIA.
[1:41:18] <Invisoguy> that looked....suspicious
[1:41:22] <ISkyHunterI> Controller DansGame
[1:41:26] <MavMarsh> VACUUM
[1:41:43] <ravencloak13> @tuxadracles I don’t get why people us sarcasm and satire when it’s clear it’s never going to work on a wide populace and not to mention it’s actually really hard to tell between someone saying it genuinely or not even with spoken words.
[1:41:46] <TheBigO75> Is that fucking king crimson
[1:41:50] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> it took you out of crit health
[1:41:54] <%Zebroneath> Yeah, Phase Rewind is only really useful in extremely specific situations.
[1:42:03] <+shinaobi> at peak performance it's literally king crimson yeah
[1:42:04] <$Superdandy96> BANG BANG BANG
[1:42:08] <thegoblinslayer666> They say he works for the mercenary, the masked man. CIA "Bane?"
[1:42:10] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> if you respawn and phase rewind does that still work
[1:42:11] <%Zebroneath> Like being chased in a hallway.
[1:42:18] <dapperskeleton69> in short, tracer would be awful in ttf
[1:42:21] <RantingRavager> Is this a new apex update? I love the new movement!
[1:42:26] <masterfire23> Bite Za Dusto
[1:42:34] <dapperskeleton69> YATAZO
[1:42:39] <+PenmanLupine> @ravencloak13 people just like to say they're being satirical so they can say something mean spirited then try to call you out for not finding it funny
[1:42:41] <MavMarsh> they should make friendly ticks blue
[1:42:43] <Josef_Stryker> Man Spectres are the worst
[1:42:44] <+TopTieramisu> @TheBigO75 except he's the one that got donut'd
[1:43:03] <ravencloak13> @rantingravager I mean, she has a bomb up ever minute or so that could take out a Titan easy so eh.
[1:43:07] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> well anyhow it used to be you could phase rewind after death and not die or something
[1:43:18] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> that doesnt sound right, there was something to it
[1:43:22] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[1:43:24] <thegoblinslayer666> Who paid you to grab Dr. Pavel?
[1:43:27] <JorDandere> No peeking.
[1:43:33] <+Cthulos> don't think so, respawning takes too long
[1:43:38] <JorDandere> atpRtsd3 atpRtsd4
[1:43:40] <%GohanEgret> woolie trying to metal gear that corner
[1:43:47] <dapperskeleton69> @ravencloak13 true she gets bombs alot, but they arent even enough to kill a full health pig man
[1:43:48] <Heartless_01> atpRtsd1 atpRtsd2
[1:43:51] <thegoblinslayer666> Tell me about Bane! Why does he wear the mask? A lot of loyalty, for a hired gun!
[1:43:53] <+zaworldo> AW YEAH WOOLIE USES LEGION
[1:43:57] <Heartless_01> atpRtsd3 atpRtsd4
[1:43:57] <MavMarsh> oh god ion
[1:44:00] <+Rum_ham1> atpRtsd1
[1:44:06] <%Zebroneath> I mean, you could attribute a lot of the pilot kits to a JoJo. LUL
[1:44:10] <+SashaStarshine> LUL
[1:44:11] <%Solidnick18> oof
[1:44:12] <+TopTieramisu> atpRtsd1 atpRtsd4

[1:44:18] <+ThatGuyfromMars> man that wasn't even 10 seconds
[1:44:19] <%DatLatinoGuy> Pogchamp
[1:44:22] <EX_Luck_Icarus> fucking wowzers
[1:44:23] <%blazymaniac> omg the amount of bad luck you are having with your titan woolz
[1:44:23] <ravencloak13> @dapperskeleton69 No but she can just hop onto a Titan and finish it off.
[1:44:29] <+SashaStarshine> That Titan got aborted
[1:44:31] <%jinking79> now a problem gonna come if Woolie play Apex randomly he's gonna start double jumping
[1:44:31] <MavMarsh> that was a 9 to 1 matchup
[1:44:32] <%GohanEgret> @g15835 7pm cst
[1:44:39] <thegoblinslayer666> Bane: It doesn't matter who we are, what matters is our plan.
[1:44:41] <+OranHexthief> for me the loss of mobilty with the grapple never justified using any of the other powers
[1:44:50] <JohnRadical> Loaded up Halo: Reach, holy fuck STILL HAS 4,290 PEOPLE. REMEMBER REACH!
[1:45:02] <ravencloak13> Well Stim is also good mobility.
[1:45:08] <ravencloak13> Though depends on the map
[1:45:09] <EX_Luck_Icarus> I personally found the grapple as a crutch
[1:45:10] <Raztron> Yea totally
[1:45:12] <+SashaStarshine> Wait even with MCC having Reach?
[1:45:16] <+SashaStarshine> Thats nuts!
[1:45:16] <%fFailureatlife> >fuhrer
[1:45:20] <thegoblinslayer666> CIA Agent : Well, congratulations! You got yourself caught! Now what's the next step in your master plan?
[1:45:21] <T4silly> "Now the odds are in our favor!"
[1:45:23] <+Cthulos> I wish the lean system were still in Apex BibleThump
[1:45:23] <+Pariah6950> @OranHexthief Same. Even if it isn't the best tactical, it's the most fun
[1:45:39] <$konekoryugamine> I knew he's play rhis
[1:45:40] <ravencloak13> I also like pulling people towards me with the grapple hook. That was always fun.
[1:45:43] <$konekoryugamine> NICE
[1:45:43] <%fFailureatlife> reach is great
[1:45:45] <sanctified_succ> yeah but you become super dependent on grapple when it's not even necessary
[1:45:51] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @JohnRadical
[1:45:56] <ISkyHunterI> Swat in sword base Kreygasm
[1:45:57] <+alpacasintophats> you also need to learn to reflex hit your boost right when you start taking hits
[1:45:57] <thegoblinslayer666> Bane : Crashing this plane... with no survivors!
[1:46:30] <ravencloak13> The speed I get from it and how in propels me across the map makes me feel it’s not actually a crutch.
[1:46:37] <$FuqBoiSlim> good God he was obliterated
[1:46:38] <+gutlesscoward> why not rewind when you're about to get titan'd
[1:46:40] <+Yokuho> why
[1:46:43] <T4silly> But I can just throw a knife and SEE where everyone is moving, so that works.
[1:46:45] <MavMarsh> got the stalker kill tho
[1:46:50] <$Superdandy96> Should’ve done a Sliiiiddddeee Woolie
[1:46:54] <thegoblinslayer666> He didn't fly so good.
[1:46:59] <krymzen5> did you kill a single player?
[1:46:59] <%yeknomlive> game was over anyways
[1:47:01] <$TRILLTURBAN> I never really liked this map, it had so much verticality that you could never really use effectively
[1:47:03] <ISkyHunterI> LUL
[1:47:09] <%Solidnick18> jeezus ronin
[1:47:12] <EX_Luck_Icarus> Yeah, I use pulse blade and I found myself doing way better than when I used grapple
[1:47:14] <+Cthulos> Is there any grappling hook tech with Pathfinder in Apex Legends yet?
[1:47:26] <ravencloak13> Not to mention I run circles around Titans and they spend the whole time trying to kill me while the rest of my team kills it. Or grapple on and kill them with a grenade
[1:47:27] <sanctified_succ> tech?
[1:47:27] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[1:47:31] <42nfl19> won my match, hopefully I can join woolie's next
[1:47:33] <+OranHexthief> don't forget melee on critical titans gives you i-frames woolie LUL

[1:48:12] <gryffinp> @WoolieVersus You should tell people not to leave games if they don't get matched with you, because that just causes chaos across the entire matchmaking queue

[1:50:27] <+tigerfang86> SELL CERBERUS TRISH
[1:50:28] <%Zebroneath> Why would you EVER sell Agni and Rudra???
[1:50:29] <PSI_Guy95> maybe he only sells to museums?
[1:50:30] <Plague_Nurse> Dante is the big dumb
[1:50:31] <cool_culainn> FOR THE RIGHTOUS ZAAZZZZAS
[1:50:35] <thetruenicster> that means that someone out there now has two swords who won't shut up
[1:50:36] <Greywolf47> selling devil arms?
[1:50:36] <+Cthulos> The books are canon iirc
[1:50:36] <%Zebroneath> ....actually, wait, nevermind.
[1:50:42] <+NWR_James> Someone has absolutely used one of Dante's arms to rob a bank
[1:50:45] <Greywolf47> wow dante be cold
[1:50:48] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> Hey you might use Cerberus SOMETIMES, but you gotta use the apartment ALL THE TIME
[1:50:49] <couch_potato_Ed_Boy> I'd fucking buy Lucifer in a heart beat!
[1:50:50] <T4silly> What about Bounty Hunt. That's a great mode.
[1:50:50] <$Tuskor13> Dante sold his Devil Arms for a Papa John's Supreme Pizza with Breadsticks
[1:50:54] <+thebonebard> imean i imagine there are other human devil hunters
[1:50:55] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> gotta pay for it somehow
[1:50:58] <+Cthulos> Dante should sell his devil arms to Rodin
[1:50:59] <lewdskeletor13> Dante is bad with money guys
[1:51:00] <+tigerfang86> Year of the Figuring out
[1:51:01] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> EVERY year is the year of the Wool
[1:51:01] <Heavensguard92> Im sure Alastor is charging someones phone or house

[1:51:05] <Neo_Kaiser> Have they tried Frontier Defense?
[1:51:09] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> !uptime
[1:51:14] <silverira> wouldnt a devil arm cost like hundreds of millions?
[1:51:16] <thetruenicster> Oh Please, Dante doesn't order Papa Johns, he has more refined taste than taht
[1:51:18] <bignerb> dante only has one brain cell guys
[1:51:21] <couch_potato_Ed_Boy> Wait, he sells them to WHO? For how much?!

[2:01:57] <%Zebroneath> @AhmCha Apex did reignite interest in the game to a lot who haven't given it a try yet. Player numbers have jumped since then.

[2:03:23] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> cause it's the best
[2:03:30] <ravencloak13> @vjcruzer I mean, we are giving him money. Along with just normal pay by the hour.
[2:03:31] <%OranHexthief> i play on xbox a lot. almost never have trouble getting a game
[2:03:34] <+Yokuho> @WoolieVersus he's probably on M+KB tho
[2:03:48] <%linkwolf4> why would you choose to socialize, when you could be gaining more power
[2:04:02] <%Agami23> im kinda confused by how woolie is playing. why is he not using a controller and a mouse?
[2:04:14] <T4silly> Well you stopped the bullets from hitting your bud.
[2:04:22] <%fatal_penguin_> Controller AND a mouse?
[2:04:26] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> I dont think you can mix controller and mouse without some fuckery
[2:04:35] <+bonzosan> @linkwolf4 sharpen that katana boi
[2:04:37] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> use the Touchpad as a mouse
[2:04:38] <%Zebroneath> Yeah, controller AND a mouse is a thing that he has done.
[2:04:44] <%NumberTooBig> @big__bang__blitz it pe like Dpad and sanwa buttons
[2:04:51] <SilentRukei> Oh shit whaddup
[2:04:52] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> you have to map the right stick to mouse or asaomethin
[2:04:55] <Neo_Kaiser> One thing I love to do in CTF is sit by my flag with 2 satchel charges in the area. Once it gets taken I set them off.
[2:04:59] <%Agami23> woolie said he played overwatch with that set up.
[2:05:08] <+Shotgundam009> Honestly you have to be fairly decent on TF2 before it matters what you play on
[2:05:13] <+Yokuho> @WoolieVersus If you put your mind to it you will get just as good as m+kb with a controller, it's an uphill battle but it's not impossible
[2:05:20] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> yeah but titanfall switches between controller or keyboard
[2:05:21] <wolvenelf> @woolieversus whatever happened to that hybrid mouse and control stick thing you were using when you played overwatch.

[2:06:13] <Asuxley> thousend of people saw it
[2:06:14] <%Zebroneath> You can't change boost mid match, I believe.
[2:06:18] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> I wanted seperate controls for the tioatn via flightstick and id switch to keyboard but that wasnt allowed
[2:06:24] <T4silly> Point and laugh at Woolie guys! His balls are out!
[2:06:25] <thelovingfool> max tunnel vision lol
[2:06:28] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> which in my opinion ius a misse dopportunity
[2:06:34] <%Solidnick18> you can only change loadouts mid game
[2:06:42] <%TechTurtle7> lol thats like max being hit by the train in spiderman ps4 "is a train.....nah" *squish*
[2:06:51] <thegoblinslayer666> The flight plan I just filed with the agency lists me, my men, Dr. Pavel here but only one of you! First one to talk gets to stay on my aircraft!

[2:07:12] <$Superdandy96> Now comes the point where we tilt our heads back and laugh at Woolie, ready?
[2:07:20] <snow_bush> This isn't the SICK NEW HOTNESS that is Apex. It's a good game

[2:08:37] <Pablo_Gonzalo> I've liked Apex. Makes me want to try out Titanfall
[2:08:41] <DesertPenguin09> Hey other penguin bro. I got two, one with randoms
[2:08:41] <%jinking79> man Apex really slow compare to this
[2:08:47] <Heavensguard92> Gotta live Titanfall with your head on a swivel!
[2:08:49] <T4silly> @big__bang__blitz Like... Switching controls midmatch...? That's WAY too much. That's near hardware levels if hitting switch, the game can't rely on that
[2:08:50] <+mechslayer71> Haha you got bamboozled, look at you!
[2:09:00] <%Zebroneath> @Pablo_Gonzalo Titanfall 2 is worth it for the campaign alone.
[2:09:10] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> titanfal is more of a game though I cant say I dislike apex as it is it's very simplistic compared to the dynanism this game has

[2:10:09] <ArgentUndaCova> @Solidnick18 plupPEEK
[2:10:11] <T4silly> Like getting in and out and in and out would be switching a dip so you move to a new controller.
[2:10:12] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> and I do that very same setup with battletech going back to 2 and up to the latest
[2:10:23] <%Jensegaense> that's a titan sentry lol
[2:10:25] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> cause its fun
[2:10:28] <%Jensegaense> Useless against players
[2:10:31] <%Agami23> woolie no.
[2:10:33] <ravencloak13> @big__bang__blitz Well, an argument can be made both games are simplistic. However Titanfall is more engaging because the main problem with BR games like Apex is they are all about trying to stay alive the longest and don’t facilitate action but hiding and building up your gear.
[2:10:35] <sanctified_succ> shhhh don't tell him
[2:10:35] <$TRILLTURBAN> I sure hope that works out for you

[2:11:08] <%fatal_penguin_> APex is the first BR game I actually wanted to get in to. A week in and I'm loving it
[2:11:09] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> having played both for any amount of time I could easily refute the idea of relativstic simplicity for titanfall 2, theres too many variables
[2:11:11] <+AhmCha> Movement in this game seems incredible
[2:11:11] <+MyDarkStorm> Welp GG
[2:11:12] <%Agami23> cant you do it at any time? the ps4 version lets you
[2:11:23] <%OranHexthief> thats okay if they don't realise and they shoot it it will target players too
[2:11:27] <Heavensguard92> Speed is life
[2:11:41] <+FuhrerVonZephyr> Change boosts? nah, that's like kill streaks
[2:11:46] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> its like 2 or 3 times more complicated to place a multiplier on it
[2:11:49] <+FuhrerVonZephyr> It lets you change everything else though
[2:12:00] <sanctified_succ> except boosts
[2:12:04] <thegoblinslayer666> Of course... Dr. Pavel refused our offer in favor of yours, we had to find out what he told you.
[2:12:30] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> simplicity makes for better play but to the detriment of a much slower game
[2:12:36] <UnfilteredComic> YOU DESERVE THAT ONE
[2:12:42] <snow_bush> I still love the titan fall 1 compaign map with the Drop Pod deployment.

[2:16:43] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> geez
[2:16:50] <@Menitta> It looks like a shitpost
[2:16:50] <thegoblinslayer666> For you.
[2:16:53] <MavMarsh> backwards kick?
[2:16:53] <RubyPilot> why would you use sights on an alternator?
[2:16:54] <Ferakin> The Skull's true nature
[2:16:56] <gryffinp> Don't worry, scorch is just posting the shrek rape copypata but with scorch
[2:16:57] <Tucker0603> scorch best boi
[2:17:01] <gryffinp> er, skull is
[2:17:08] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> I read most of that though sinc eI can speedread so nice points but yeah its just faster and more complicated
[2:17:10] <ArchLightAce> still waiting for woolie to kraber'd
[2:17:11] <%linkwolf4> skull no one likes a MEMER woolieOMG
[2:17:18] <RubyPilot> theres literally no point to ADS on most of the smgs
[2:17:19] <T4silly> We talking about PAPA?
[2:17:19] <Tucker0603> skull is a true shit poster
[2:17:38] <gryffinp> HOKUTO NO TITAN
[2:17:40] <sanctified_succ> I can hear the kraber
[2:17:42] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> unarguably so, if apex was a little faster that would be great
[2:17:43] <+Jip___> ludwigC
[2:17:44] <+MyDarkStorm> What was your Plan?
[2:17:48] <jase__x> love this gsme
[2:17:55] <+Jip___> isnt this a baby game for 5 year olds?
[2:17:59] <Heavensguard92> anti titan weapons can kill sentries
[2:17:59] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> if this were a little slower though I dont want it, it would be accepootable
[2:17:59] <+RiddleMeWhat> yuck, turned to mist
[2:18:03] <Ferakin> It's alright tho, I sitll have that picture of WoolieDIO using the Road Roller Skull to slam Pataro
[2:18:05] <MavMarsh> every road on this map is a deathroad
[2:18:06] <%avantgard3n> "oh fuc--*BOOM*"
[2:18:08] <@Menitta> Jeeeeez
[2:18:09] <thegoblinslayer666> Or perhaps he's wondering why someone would shoot a man, before throwing him out of a plane?
[2:18:11] <+MyDarkStorm> TITAN WEAPONS
[2:18:13] <+timbob> o shit when did they add titans to apex
[2:18:15] <@Menitta> JEEEEEEEEZ
[2:18:16] <pistachio_the_nut> LUL
[2:18:24] <$FuqBoiSlim> 3 TIMES IN A ROW
[2:18:26] <+CreakySkelly> to be fair, Tone is absolute cancer
[2:18:32] <$FuqBoiSlim> BY THE SAME GUY
[2:18:32] <ravencloak13> @big__bang__blitz They always gut speed in BR game for some reason so that will never change. Well you do have new ones coming out that are much faster like Spell Break.
[2:18:33] <@Menitta> Fuck Tone
[2:18:34] <+WhyIDie> if you keep trying, maybe you can clog his guns with your giblets LUL
[2:18:36] <wolvenelf> sbfpScared
[2:18:36] <jase__x> LUL you better start sneaking around woolie
[2:18:37] <krymzen5> i find it helps if i'm firing at a long range with an smg
[2:18:38] <+MyDarkStorm> You have a rocket Launcher
[2:18:41] <TUBA_PLAYER> I just gotta join the sbfp group right to play?
[2:18:47] <Tucker0603> poor woolz
[2:18:49] <Heavensguard92> back to the watchtonedie subreddit
[2:18:49] <rsg220> this is what happens when everyone has a titan
[2:18:49] <T4silly> You dont.
[2:18:50] <MavMarsh> this is some serious titan domination
[2:18:53] <%GlewmanIII> try using the stun grenades on titans
[2:18:56] <AMaidIndeed> Can't escape from crossing fate
[2:18:57] <ravencloak13> I never get why though given how big the maps are.
[2:18:57] <gryffinp> I don't like this map
[2:19:03] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> yeah it makes it more accessable, and apex is still the gfastest one outsid eof like.. totally realistic battlegrounds
[2:19:06] <T4silly> Spicy Boy!
[2:19:06] <+RiddleMeWhat> Fight! Cling to life!
[2:19:08] <Shufflemang> Crash Site is truly an abomination of a map
[2:19:08] <thegoblinslayer666> At least you can talk. Who are you? It doesn't matter who we are, what matters is our plan.
[2:19:23] <ArchLightAce> props tot hat northstar it's tough to hit pilots with the railgun
[2:19:36] <ArchLightAce> YES
[2:19:36] <@Menitta> LUL
[2:19:37] <jase__x> damn that was fast
[2:19:50] <ArchLightAce> IT HAPPENED
[2:19:52] <+MyDarkStorm> Power of Mouse/Keyboard
[2:19:52] <sanctified_succ> @shufflemang better than complex
[2:19:54] <ravencloak13> I’d say the slower pace actually makes it way less accessible. It’s just the fact it’s free that makes it more popular.
[2:19:55] <thegoblinslayer666> He didn't fly so good! Who wants to try next?
[2:19:58] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> that makes my blood boil
[2:20:04] <N1netbattler> is this on pc?
[2:20:06] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> that shot was excellent
[2:20:08] <MavMarsh> clearly TF3 should be F2P
[2:20:10] <SuttonOMEGA> N1netbattler yes
[2:20:12] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Seto Kraber we out here
[2:20:13] <@Menitta> Try spinning! That's a good trick!
[2:20:17] <+DatGuyJimbo> damn you notice alot of asset reuse with apex looking bk on tf2
[2:20:18] <MKUltima> Wooliiieee
[2:20:27] <%CptnCampy61> Was quick scoping a thing in this game? I don’t remember
[2:20:32] <thegoblinslayer666> Crashing this plane... with no survivors!
[2:20:35] <nightcoremoon> @MavMarsh can't spend money on a game that'll never exist :P
[2:20:37] <Heavensguard92> rarely get goosed on console, which I am thankful for
[2:20:38] <@mothmandraws> I made it
[2:20:41] <MavMarsh> OOF
[2:20:45] <+CreakySkelly> well yeah Apex is just literally nothing but these assets besides the characters
[2:20:46] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> you can quick scope and certain attachments make it easier
[2:20:49] <N1netbattler> Hes crazy, all the ultra killers are here
[2:20:50] <thegoblinslayer666> If I pull that off, would you die?
[2:20:51] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> like.. the quick scope
[2:20:58] <ravencloak13> @cptncampy61 I remember more people throwing ninja stars at me then quick scoping.
[2:21:03] <sanctified_succ> lol
[2:21:07] <$FuqBoiSlim> it would be extremely painful
[2:21:07] <thegoblinslayer666> You're a big guy!
[2:21:13] <+ThatGuyfromMars> For you.
[2:21:18] <$FuqBoiSlim> UUUU
[2:21:25] <thegoblinslayer666> uuuu
[2:21:28] <jase__x> can he escape though
[2:21:32] <snow_bush> I forgot, could you blow-up the dropship?
[2:21:37] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> yes
[2:21:40] <sanctified_succ> yes u can
[2:21:41] <jase__x> yes
[2:21:44] <MavMarsh> you can do it with amped guns even
[2:21:45] <gryffinp> If there's one thing that bothers me about titanfall 2 it's the faction voice overs being pointlessly optimistic when things are utterly screwed
[2:21:46] <+RiddleMeWhat> that noire guy is a beast though
[2:21:53] <ravencloak13> It’s the main goal to blow it up at the end.
[2:21:56] <%PlumpPotatoRump> woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM
[2:21:57] <+berserkscarlett> You think this gives you power over me?...
[2:21:59] <NoirePanzer> I'm traaaash
[2:22:07] <%PlumpPotatoRump> !uptime
[2:22:07] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 22 minutes
[2:22:10] <ravencloak13> MOVE LIKE LEVI!
[2:22:10] <sanctified_succ> COLD WAR
[2:22:14] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> i'd use the sniper titan just so that when we win the dropship gets annihilated 100%
[2:22:14] <+FuhrerVonZephyr> Another good game. Imma do attrition to let others have a slot for a game or two
[2:22:15] <snow_bush> Noice.
[2:22:17] <T4silly> Cold War~
[2:22:19] <TwentyCXII> C O L D W A R
[2:22:21] <sjcodan> Strafing works better on a keyboard, since its instant
[2:22:21] <KingVantq> I wish they had the japanese titan voice or a japanese faction in this game
[2:22:24] <Heavensguard92> Speed is Life wools
[2:22:28] <thegoblinslayer666> Uh, you don't get to bring friends.
[2:22:30] <BeefyQueefer> Gotta learn how to Dodge, Duck, Dip, Dive, and Dodge. 5 D's of Dodgefall.
[2:22:32] <%lewdskeletor13> woolieF woolieU
[2:22:32] <+MyDarkStorm> alternator not good in those reach
[2:22:33] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> also I like sniping
[2:22:47] <N1netbattler> We take L and learn from it
[2:22:48] <ravencloak13> @big__bang__blitz I thought Legion was better for destroying it?
[2:22:49] <+FuhrerVonZephyr> We could do glitch 24/7
[2:22:53] <pistachio_the_nut> Attrition
[2:23:00] <%Skullgod> 5
[2:23:01] <@mothmandraws> Is that Streamgod skullgod in VC
[2:23:03] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> I can do it from anywher eon the map without exposing myself
[2:23:05] <%Skullgod> 4
[2:23:07] <%Skullgod> 3
[2:23:08] <%Skullgod> 2
[2:23:09] <%Skullgod> 1
[2:23:10] <thegoblinslayer666> 0
[2:23:12] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> but legion does it best for sure
[2:23:16] <+ThatGuyfromMars> -1
[2:23:20] <T4silly> Awww man. I was hoping for some Bounty Hunt.
[2:23:20] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:23:23] <+Shampoohyay> it just tries to find space so you're very likely to just get attrition; we'll see
[2:23:25] <+AppleBasket> -3
[2:23:28] <thegoblinslayer666> -4
[2:23:38] <gryffinp> It's not double xp, it's a one-time bonus of 5 xp
[2:23:39] <NoirePanzer> I'm holding back that way others get to play since I got 2 in a row
[2:23:43] <+MyDarkStorm> Its 5 xp
[2:23:51] <Xiangchang> Any Jump Force happening tonight and/or tomorrow?
[2:23:54] <ravencloak13> I mean, if your killing the drop ship you should usually be winning at that point so shouldn’t need to worry about people killing your Titan when they running away.
[2:24:06] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> it used to be double yeah
[2:24:13] <@mothmandraws> its double half your xp + 5xp
[2:24:23] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> also you could just go to different servers and get the bonus again
[2:24:27] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> which was funny
[2:24:28] <@Menitta> WE CANT LET THEM PIN US DOWN
[2:24:29] <thegoblinslayer666> He didn't fly so good.
[2:24:30] <Shufflemang> Happy hour only works once per day
[2:24:34] <+MyDarkStorm> NotLikeThis
[2:24:37] <%Solidnick18> yeah
[2:24:37] <T4silly> Colony~
[2:24:50] <aatejada> s w i n g f i r s t
[2:24:50] <sanctified_succ> the melee is B's in this game lol
[2:24:59] <@mothmandraws> This new apex map is cool
[2:25:00] <Xiangchang> Whoa! This is my favorite Titanfall 1 map, I didn't know they added it into the sequel. Neat.
[2:25:02] <sanctified_succ> *BS
[2:25:04] <ravencloak13> Man, I don’t know how people could quick scope in this game with how fast it is.
[2:25:13] <@Menitta> they added a few TF1 maps.
[2:25:26] <+CapnCarnivore> juice on the alternator? nice. I prefer mastiff / LSTAR on the juice but that's good too
[2:25:26] <+MyDarkStorm> NotLikeThis
[2:25:30] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> target acquisition gets a lot of help from the game
[2:25:33] <ravencloak13> Like, at mid range I can get but with how easy it is to get into peoples faces.
[2:25:46] <+DrDenorax> Is there enough people back on Titanfall to warrant me buying it on Origin now?
[2:25:50] <+ORGANizerC> woolie you're playing a PC shooter with a controller
[2:25:52] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> lots of indicators, clear view off targets, good visual design
[2:25:54] <+AppleBasket> Alternator is better with Phase or Sensor imo
[2:25:56] <@mothmandraws> I think you need an aimbot
[2:25:58] <+ORGANizerC> people will dominate you
[2:26:01] <+Nobrev> keep that curve but increase sensitivity. 2 is absurdly low
[2:26:08] <thegoblinslayer666> Kill em all Woolie.
[2:26:11] <@Menitta> Aimbot would definitely help Kappa
[2:26:16] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> Iof all the games ive played sniping in this is almost the easiest
[2:26:18] <+MyDarkStorm> Why are you not sliding
[2:26:20] <+CapnCarnivore> @DrDenorax player count spiked into the thousands once Apex released. Constant players at all times now
[2:26:26] <MavMarsh> yeah low sensitivity on a pad is a death sentence
[2:26:36] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> but only because battlefield 3 let you do shit like headshotting from 1600 meters away
[2:26:39] <%DatLatinoGuy> holy shit that kill
[2:26:40] <sanctified_succ> ooooooooo
[2:26:41] <+AppleBasket> Woolie's main problem is that he's travelling slowly. If he learned to crouch midair before he hits the ground he would die a lot less
[2:26:49] <ArchLightAce> KRABER KREW
[2:26:50] <42nfl19> @WoolieVersus Could you not do your half and half setup?
[2:26:51] <+DrDenorax> @CapnCarnivore That sounds great, i'll check the price for it.
[2:26:53] <ravencloak13> The only thing good about PC controls is the mouse for shooting. Controller lets you actually move good.
[2:26:54] <@mothmandraws> bamboozled
[2:26:55] <+Baesel20xx> @CapnCarnivore I wonder if thats because people downloaded Origin again and were like OH RIGHT TITANFALL 2 (basically like im doing now)
[2:26:56] <+MyDarkStorm> BAITED
[2:26:56] <+Shadowthedigger> BAMBOOZLED
[2:26:58] <%Wonderbot3000> Baited
[2:27:01] <+Hamblasto> Titanfall is actually pretty playable with controller
[2:27:02] <odd_slater> I'd rather not play on PC cause I hate keyboard
[2:27:03] <+goose_attack_almanac> BAMboozled
[2:27:05] <jase__x> BAITED
[2:27:19] <%mobius_won> Tricked
[2:27:21] <NoirePanzer> Get those speedy slides going
[2:27:21] <ravencloak13> Especially when your moving this fast.
[2:27:22] <MavMarsh> he's not gonna learn to bunnyhop on stream lol
[2:27:22] <+CapnCarnivore> @Baesel20xx or they played Apex, and went "Naw, TF|2 is where it's at"
[2:27:23] <KamiKiryu> Always be sliding
[2:27:27] <MavMarsh> that takes practice
[2:27:30] <+paladinstarbuster> Woolie is being a literal sitting duck
[2:27:37] <Shufflemang> No slidehopping?
[2:27:43] <T4silly> Bamboozled. Spicy Boys. Papa Scorch. You'll know em when you hear em.
[2:27:44] <+MyDarkStorm> @WoolieVersus You should Slide More
[2:27:47] <sanctified_succ> always wall running and sliding
[2:27:55] <@mothmandraws> mech blocked
[2:27:56] <ravencloak13> They call it bunny hopping when you hit the ground running/sliding?
[2:27:58] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> slide into a dude and dragon punch him, the grapple kick him. It's great
[2:27:58] <Heavensguard92> TF2 is playable on controller, but if you're doing controller on pc. You're gonna have a bad time.
[2:28:00] <+Baesel20xx> @CapnCarnivore oh certainly, but they could have done that before. Just trying Apex got them back on Origin tho.
[2:28:01] <jase__x> you move a round the mape way fast when sliding and jumping everywhere
[2:28:02] <+Hamblasto> Never be not sliding
[2:28:08] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> Up your sensitivity from 2, it's causing you to turn far too slow for target acquisition. If the sensitivity is too high, then you'll be overshooting your target
[2:28:09] <+AppleBasket> crouching is half the game, you can slide off ledges, down hills, out of the air
[2:28:11] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> try it yourself
[2:28:21] <+Javaa01> Always maintain momentum
[2:28:21] <+CreakySkelly> try upping your sensitivity just a bit, 2 is really really low
[2:28:23] <ArchLightAce> Woolie just needs time to get used to the movement again
[2:28:24] <@mothmandraws> all father give me sight
[2:28:26] <+Javaa01> Speed is life
[2:28:36] <ravencloak13> Be Captain Levi!
[2:28:41] <+Nobrev> @WoolieVersus your aim sensitivity might be way too low for a gamepad. try upping it a little bit
[2:28:45] <Shufflemang> sped is leaf
[2:28:46] <@mothmandraws> zombi stop bullying
[2:28:49] <jase__x> this is not a good match
[2:28:50] <+paladinstarbuster> Always go up when you run try to gain elavation it give you better vantage points and makes you less vulnerable
[2:28:56] <%DeathsDoom> don't bully the woolie
[2:29:05] <%djinnJuice> I'm coming for you, motherfucker
[2:29:16] <ravencloak13> ...the whole of the enemy team has their Titan’s up...
[2:29:29] <MavMarsh> cluster inc
[2:29:31] <+Urgotfantasy> run apatDab
[2:29:32] <Heavensguard92> Swtich the archer for Thunderbolt. It can help get your titan faster!
[2:29:34] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> that gun is ass beyond ass
[2:29:36] <T4silly> Woolie not looking around more in the watchtower scared me
[2:29:39] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Don't stress Woolz you're doing fine, we're just hyped to have you playing x
[2:29:40] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> the archer is
[2:29:46] <jase__x> oof
[2:29:47] <T4silly> Could a bee n a guy up there.
[2:29:50] <WorldFapRevealed> titanfall boo
[2:29:57] <@mothmandraws> boomshaka bully
[2:30:12] <sanctified_succ> @big__bang__blitz my least favorite Titan weapon
[2:30:18] <apostateCourier> it's a crazy game, don't feel bad about not being great immediately <3
[2:30:26] <Heavensguard92> Thunderbolt is literally a ball of AOE lightning
[2:30:26] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[2:30:33] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> its just not great especially when you can just have a semi automatic railgun
[2:30:37] <jase__x> it's a learning process
[2:30:38] <+Urgotfantasy> LUL
[2:30:39] <@Menitta> PogChamp
[2:30:42] <ArchLightAce> YEEAAAAH
[2:30:44] <+MyDarkStorm> @WoolieVersus Quick tip The Grapple hook is far faster than Stim
[2:30:45] <MavMarsh> PogChamp
[2:30:46] <jase__x> DAAAAAAMN
[2:30:49] <KingVantq> i miss those executions
[2:30:52] <$TRILLTURBAN> He paid to kill you like that
[2:30:52] <fmc009> Tittiefall 2 Kreygasm on pc ?(
[2:30:53] <apostateCourier> oh shit git dunked
[2:30:54] <+Urgotfantasy> get in the robot, woolie
[2:30:59] <fmc009> :(
[2:31:01] <+Hamblasto> Got you in the pipe, five by five
[2:31:02] <+AppleBasket> I personally think the Lockon Rocket is bad, it requires too much commitment compared to the triple grenade launcher
[2:31:11] <+YabbaTroll> yo tf2 wat
[2:31:14] <sanctified_succ> he did it!
[2:31:15] <%Solidnick18> i love the inner pieces execution
[2:31:15] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> yeah the archer is just the worst
[2:31:19] <+YabbaTroll> is this a thing i can join into?
[2:31:30] <ravencloak13> @mydarkstorm Depends on the map. Yeah on this one I’d say grapple is better but for the more enclosed spaces stim far better.
[2:31:31] <ArchLightAce> "You're too weak for the skies"
[2:31:31] <Heavensguard92> Archer is good in Frontier, but Thunderbolt is king
[2:31:36] <+Javaa01> The Archer is fine, but it can be countered, and it leaves you very open
[2:31:39] <Shufflemang> I thought the Archer was decent.
[2:31:48] <%djinnJuice> I just remembered that smart gun isn't in apex
[2:31:50] <%DeathsDoom> @YabbaTroll it is
[2:31:52] <+Hamblasto> Let me introduce you to the ground
[2:32:00] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> ill thunderboplt all day, but if you have the right mix of stealth grenades will rock a titan to the core
[2:32:07] <+Javaa01> Where as you can just spam the shit out of the MGL and Thunderbolt without care and annoy everyone
[2:32:12] <+YabbaTroll> @DeathsDoom oh boy, its kraber tryhard time
[2:32:14] <MavMarsh> kraber pls
[2:32:14] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> stealth and fire a few grenades, rodeo accordingly
[2:32:15] <ravencloak13> @djinnjuice It’s cause the characters move so slow that smart gun would actually be OP in that game.
[2:32:25] <ArchLightAce> I need an airhorn everytime that guy kills woolie with the kraber
[2:32:32] <Heavensguard92> MGL is the best dang thing if you can stay above the titan. like in the desert map with the long corridors
[2:32:38] <T4silly> Blew himself up...
[2:32:45] <@mothmandraws> got in the robot
[2:32:48] <official_nakmatic> How is Woolie not getting sick playing an FPS? WutFace
[2:32:50] <Freezern> The time to kill difference between Titanfall2 and Apex is pure insanity
[2:32:55] <mayorrev> i love hearing the titans speak
[2:32:58] <%djinnJuice> there's plenty of strong guns in that game anyways
[2:32:59] <$TRILLTURBAN> smoosh
[2:33:00] <mayorrev> theyre so sweet
[2:33:12] <fmc009> Woolie only gets sick on bad FPS games Kappa
[2:33:19] <Heavensguard92> I miss the first titanfall with the custom voices for titans
[2:33:31] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> a good use for phase rewind, if you rodeo a titan its devastating. they can shock you and you can just rewind to full health, or hover over them firing grenades and rewind and do it again
[2:33:32] <+MyDarkStorm> @ravencloak13 enclosed spaces are a rare case in this map
[2:33:35] <ravencloak13> @mayorrev I wish we had the different language voices and Snoop Dog again
[2:33:37] <Heavensguard92> had the japanese voice for titan, cuz weebness
[2:33:40] <Shufflemang> @ravencloak13 Technically the Smart Gun was already OP in Titanfall, so putting in Apex would've made it even more of a monster than it was.
[2:33:48] <jase__x> guess he doesnt have the smoke equipped
[2:33:58] <%djinnJuice> @woolieversus what match types should I be matching in to to play?
[2:34:10] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> its not patched out, there sa hard counte rthough
[2:34:13] <+Javaa01> Bailing out to counter rodeo was a TiF1 thing
[2:34:21] <@mothmandraws> that dudes been running with kraber all match lol
[2:34:26] <+paladinstarbuster> Hey Woolz Always go up when you run try to gain elevation it gives you better vantage points and makes you less vulnerable
[2:34:26] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> many hard counters
[2:34:26] <turbofolk> Woolie how did you learned to not get butthurt by continous stompings?
[2:34:39] <ArchLightAce> That guy is a beast with the kraber
[2:34:39] <MavMarsh> he's a fighting game player
[2:34:40] <apostateCourier> kraberrrr :argh:
[2:34:42] <+CreakySkelly> my favorite is using scorch, to thermite a ceiling and use it to burn the guy on your back
[2:34:42] <ravencloak13> @shufflemang OP since people didn’t know that you’d need to take a few seconds to lock on which you can get out of by dip dive dodge and ducking like a mad man.
[2:34:45] <@mothmandraws> he had some good shots on you earlier
[2:34:49] <+FuhrerVonZephyr> Also remember to search using the New York data centers too
[2:34:59] <@mothmandraws> woolie when are you doing mozambique only
[2:35:06] <@mothmandraws> entire lobby mozambique
[2:35:07] <%djinnJuice> mozamb is good in this game
[2:35:10] <%djinnJuice> don't talk shit
[2:35:13] <%djinnJuice> I'm bringing it now lol
[2:35:14] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> .. I wouldnt say balanced
[2:35:21] <+Shampoohyay> yo we mozu boys?
[2:35:24] <KamiKiryu> Mozambeast

[2:35:30] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 35 minutes
[2:35:33] <+MyDarkStorm> Apex weapon Feel alot Different
[2:35:33] <$TRILLTURBAN> woolie open ur loot boxes pls
[2:35:36] <%Solidnick18> Mastiff is beast
[2:35:36] <stote45> top tier melee combo weapon
[2:35:37] <sanctified_succ> memestiff
[2:35:39] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> remember the devotion era
[2:35:44] <apostateCourier> apex in general feels different
[2:35:45] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> taht was omeeee fun
[2:35:46] <@mothmandraws> its the advantage of shared universe games
[2:35:51] <Triplicat> i see you and raise you spitfire in both games
[2:35:57] <+MyDarkStorm> Not likely
[2:36:03] <+Javaa01> Devotion got the nerf bat like 3 weeks from launch
[2:36:05] <ArchLightAce> I love the mastiff because it reminds me of the doom shotgun
[2:36:05] <sanctified_succ> naw
[2:36:06] <Heavensguard92> Mozam is gonna be a apex humilation weapon
[2:36:15] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> 3 months from launch mor elike
[2:36:43] <@mothmandraws> when can we get the cool cherry blossom maps in apex
[2:37:00] <+MyDarkStorm> Quick question can you play apex legend without origin?
[2:37:00] <KamiKiryu> This is such a bad map
[2:37:02] <+Joshuackbar> Hey, Woolie, how long are you planning on streaming?
[2:37:06] <sanctified_succ> best. map.
[2:37:16] <%GarbageNirvana> Matrix fighting
[2:37:23] <%madhattergay> !uptime
[2:37:23] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 37 minutes
[2:37:38] <%GarbageNirvana> @MyDarkStorm Not on PC unfortunately
[2:37:38] <MavMarsh> it's a lane map where the lanes are all speed boosts
[2:37:38] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:37:39] <+Javaa01> First 3 months was more like the infinite Volt pick era
[2:37:50] <Shufflemang> Aw cool, Glitch is a good map.
[2:38:01] <+AppleBasket> what kind of button mapping is Wools using?
[2:38:02] <42nfl19> Titanfall2 is Expert Pilots. Apex is Grunts on a reality TV show?
[2:38:03] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> volt was hilariously broken
[2:38:07] <%blazymaniac> i fuckin hate glitch
[2:38:09] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> BUT HEN THE MASTIFF
[2:38:20] <+MyDarkStorm> Fuck
[2:38:28] <+Neon_Negro> Just picked up two copies of TF|2 for me and my brother because of you woolz. The sad thing is I got them for $4 CAD each at a Dollarama
[2:38:32] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> it's like hey lets put the contra spread gun in our game
[2:38:35] <KamiKiryu> @blazymaniac Thank you, a man of culture I see
[2:38:35] <haisho> man aiming with controller while wallrunning in this game looks ROUGH
[2:38:43] <Darren716> Float is great for fighting titans
[2:38:43] <Heavensguard92> well atleast no one is A-walling
[2:39:01] <rsg220> hover always felt like "PLEASE SHOOT ME"
[2:39:04] <Shufflemang> @woolieversus Try cooking your grenades for a while before throwing them. If you can time it right, they're mini-shotguns like the melee.
[2:39:15] <ghostravens> nope
[2:39:26] <sanctified_succ> @haisho there are a ton of controller options that makes aiming more precise
[2:39:36] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> shit titanfall 2 just got a new patch huh
[2:39:41] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> maybe it is time
[2:39:42] <AFlyingTaco1> Woolie, ADS when they're that far away LUL
[2:39:43] <thebestestkevin> beware of Shampoo and his Kaber
[2:39:57] <+MyDarkStorm> Yeah woolie you may want to switch weapons
[2:39:59] <%GarbageNirvana> I'll be real, I'm thinking of picking this up again
[2:40:11] <+Shampoohyay> don't worry, not only did i switch to a mozu again but i'm in another match entirely :V
[2:40:15] <AFlyingTaco1> @GarbageNirvana It's only 10 bucks on console
[2:40:18] <snow_bush> @GarbageNirvana Same, but that requires me giving EA money
[2:40:19] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> there is stil no better fps and I will fight the point
[2:40:29] <+Nobrev> woolie you can cook frag grenades
[2:40:38] <AFlyingTaco1> @Big__Bang__Blitz No need to, honestly, cuz it's true.
[2:40:41] <$TRILLTURBAN> aww that was nice of you
[2:40:52] <@mothmandraws> I have a feeling having easy access batteries on top of the titans is a very big structural weakness
[2:40:55] <%GarbageNirvana> You know what would really boost this game's sales, if they did a tie-in with Apex
[2:40:56] <Heavensguard92> its so kooky to see a titan spin so fast
[2:40:58] <+Javaa01> Cooking nades in this is mandatory considering the movement speed
[2:40:59] <Shufflemang> That's why you need to cook grenades and throw them right before they blow.
[2:41:00] <+Romulus1213> what console?
[2:41:02] <%GarbageNirvana> Like buying Titanfall 2 got you loot packs or something
[2:41:03] <%CptnCampy61> It’s crazy nobody else has been able to do movement like this game
[2:41:05] <ArchLightAce> You have to cook frag grenades for a pretty long time in this game
[2:41:12] <42nfl19> What data center is skullgod using?
[2:41:14] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> I just want tf2 to have a borderless option is all
[2:41:23] <sanctified_succ> cod tried to do the movement lol
[2:41:27] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> I mean you can just use a directx windower but cmon guys
[2:41:33] <+d00msdaydan> can't go wrong with some good ol' sustained aggressive counterfire
[2:41:34] <Chocolate_Burrito> is the game on sale anywhere for pc?
[2:41:42] <jase__x> I wish there were A TF3 because this game had the sickest executions
[2:41:53] <%ZombiLoin> maybe check g2a? i don't like their business practices but you can probably find it cheap
[2:41:53] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> there may yet be a tf3
[2:41:54] <%GarbageNirvana> Oh shit, ultimate edition on PS4 is only $7.49 if you have PS+
[2:42:03] <%ZombiLoin> they were selling pc titanfall 2 for only 5 dollars on amazon at one point
[2:42:10] <justachap> inb4 next Titanfall game is a card game Kappa
[2:42:12] <%ZombiLoin> so there might be a lot of keys on g2a
[2:42:14] <+Romulus1213> woolie on PC?
[2:42:28] <Shufflemang> @romulus1213 Yup
[2:42:28] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> it seems mor elikely every day also I will point out again you can play tf2 for 5 bucks if you get a basic subscription to origin
[2:42:28] <+IamScorpius> Yes woolie is on pc
[2:42:30] <axivate_> @justachap nonsense, it'll be a mobile exclusive
[2:42:32] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> for a month
[2:42:33] <+Romulus1213> thank you
[2:42:33] <+seetrus> just gotta push all your friends who play apex to play T|F2
[2:42:38] <$Superdandy96> @mothmandraws uh.... um.... *Engineer jumps out of window*
[2:42:43] <ArchLightAce> The executions in apex aren't nearly as cool as the ones in this game
[2:42:47] <@mothmandraws> man imamgine if they made a titanfall battle royal
[2:42:59] <+CreakySkelly> yeah what if
[2:43:01] <%GarbageNirvana> Wouldn't that be nuts
[2:43:03] <MavMarsh> that would be amazing
[2:43:04] <Shufflemang> Apex doesn't have telefrags and that makes me sad.
[2:43:04] <sanctified_succ> @seetrus I've pissed all my friends off LUL
[2:43:07] <RubyPilot> could you imagine
[2:43:08] <jase__x> thatd be sick
[2:43:08] <speech1000000> Can anyone tell me why he's on PC if he's using pad? Aren't there more people on PS4 anyway?
[2:43:09] <KamiKiryu> ABS System bois, Always be sliding!
[2:43:10] <+Tonyboi80> woah i didnt know ppl still play this. respect
[2:43:12] <mandjelo> imagine
[2:43:15] <+seetrus> me too man @sanctified_succ
[2:43:20] <theotrainwreck> I would play the shit out of that man
[2:43:20] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> def less on ps4
[2:43:24] <@mothmandraws> because woolie is a masochist speech
[2:43:29] <@mothmandraws> he likes to be bullied
[2:43:39] <Chocolate_Burrito> holy shit, i never really looked at titanfall 2 gameplay. i can see what they used for apex
[2:43:42] <MavMarsh> just play lame woolie
[2:43:47] <+AppleBasket> I recommend the Lightning Grenade @WoolieVersus , It will explode way faster, stun enemies, stun titans, kill people on 40% hp
[2:43:49] <speech1000000> Guess so lol It looks like it doesn't have aim assist.
[2:43:51] <%barkon345> titan fall battle royal would be broken as fuck
[2:43:59] <haisho> just need to recognize those opportunities
[2:43:59] <+seetrus> you gotta bait the smoke then go back in
[2:44:00] <+CreakySkelly> it def has aim assist
[2:44:02] <+paladinstarbuster> its not a bad idea you have to get used to it
[2:44:03] <$TRILLTURBAN> not really, newly dropped Titans are easy targets
[2:44:04] <+Javaa01> I mean, the guy who worked on the last couple of executions that came out of TiF2 post-release got hired by Infinity Ward
[2:44:05] <mandjelo> northstar would be top tier
[2:44:09] <xeros720> the success rate is very poor
[2:44:13] <@mothmandraws> well barkon what if they made titanfall battle royal but toned down the movement options
[2:44:15] <MavMarsh> AR's basically have aimbot
[2:44:15] <%Solidnick18> lol
[2:44:21] <KamiKiryu> Northstar IS top tier
[2:44:22] <MattriX77> Story of Woolies life. I wanted to be cool, but I failed
[2:44:24] <official_nakmatic> Playing a movement shooter on PC with a pad LUL
[2:44:26] <@Menitta> Man this map is so fucking cool
[2:44:31] <Shufflemang> Northstar and Ions are pretty much top tier
[2:44:32] <+CreakySkelly> that'd be kinda lame but I think it'd still be the best BR
[2:44:33] <CoplandOS> is he playing on an xbone
[2:44:37] <ArchLightAce> Northstar is top tier in my heart
[2:44:42] <mandjelo> that doesnt soubd like ronin
[2:44:42] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:44:44] <ArchLightAce> but sadly thats about it
[2:44:46] <Chocolate_Burrito> this map gives me a bungie feel
[2:44:46] <CoplandOS> nvm just took a second to read
[2:44:48] <+JayEarly> I love both of the simulator maps
[2:44:49] <sanctified_succ> @mothmandraws hmmmmm i think you're on to something
[2:44:50] <@mothmandraws> but ye I really hope 2nd apex map adds some of the sci fi city stuff
[2:44:52] <jase__x> gotta be smart when stealing those batteries
[2:44:56] <+JayEarly> Wargames is so cool
[2:44:57] <@mothmandraws> or just the weeb maps
[2:44:57] <+seetrus> tbh I wish the pilot abilities werent tied to appearance. I dont wanna be a robot
[2:45:05] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> ifnorthstar is by far the sexiest titan
[2:45:08] <@Menitta> this map is top tier aesthetic
[2:45:11] <+CreakySkelly> why would you not want to be a robot
[2:45:12] <+JayEarly> never made much sense that stim is a robot
[2:45:23] <Chocolate_Burrito> robots are icky
[2:45:23] <+JayEarly> robot drugs?
[2:45:25] <speech1000000> I would guess Apex would go the LoL/MOBA route where they keep the one map for a long time.
[2:45:29] <%Zebroneath> An angel city esque map in Apex would be great.
[2:45:30] <@mothmandraws> but seetrus if you are a robot it means you spend 100% of the match getting in the robot
[2:45:36] <+seetrus> why would the make a robot to pilot a robot
[2:45:42] <SuttonOMEGA> GUN
[2:45:54] <%Solidnick18> monarch PogChamp
[2:45:55] <Chocolate_Burrito> oh no
[2:45:58] <sanctified_succ> @jayearly it's because they have been augmented to move that fast, or disappear like phase
[2:46:00] <%Solidnick18> oh shit
[2:46:00] <@mothmandraws> robot doesnt have to deal with motion sickness and g force
[2:46:04] <jase__x> hes so dead
[2:46:06] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> if a robot enters a robot to pilot it is that legally concentual sex
[2:46:10] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> I hope so
[2:46:12] <Chocolate_Burrito> not anymore lol
[2:46:15] <MavMarsh> why would it be called stim tho
[2:46:16] <@Menitta> "alive"
[2:46:19] <+CreakySkelly> Yeah stim is a robot because if a human went that fast in an instant they've fucking die
[2:46:20] <MavMarsh> why not, like, overdrive?
[2:46:21] <ToastyBroDude> PEW
[2:46:21] <KamiKiryu> Secret compartment is good with legion
[2:46:22] <@mothmandraws> pretty sure most of the human pilots would be dead from too much G force
[2:46:23] <+seetrus> but why not just have the robot built into the other robot
[2:46:25] <speech1000000> What if there's an even smaller robot piloting the human sized robot piloting the giant robot?
[2:46:27] <+goose_attack_almanac> Crazy Talk is an infectious stand
[2:46:29] <jase__x> CRAZY TALK

[2:47:57] <mayorrev> bailing out of your titans must be hard when they seem sentient

[2:49:52] <xeros720> i can see hispanic
[2:49:52] <apostateCourier> his whole thing is that he was pissed about not getting live test subjects for his gas chambers re: Caustic
[2:49:53] <bardicfire> He can't Gas other Caustics?
[2:49:54] <gryffinp> Are Apex characters locked behind paywalls with unique mechanics? Because that's hot garbage, no matter what race they are.
[2:49:54] <+thebonebard> i saw somoeone genuinly upset about the only white guy being behind a paywall and calling it a sjw game, i think he also called it communist
[2:49:59] <+Nobrev> bloodhound is norse
[2:50:06] <@mothmandraws> its more just an unlock gryf
[2:50:11] <@mothmandraws> you get him after like 20-30 games
[2:50:14] <KingVantq> @gryffinp you can earn him in game
[2:50:14] <SuttonOMEGA> thebonebard those people are weird and should never be taken seriously Jebaited
[2:50:15] <gryffinp> Fine.
[2:50:16] <+CreakySkelly> bloodhound is probably white but well, not confirmed
[2:50:31] <gryffinp> WOOLIE GO GET HYDRATED
[2:50:34] <Shufflemang> @gryffinp It's possible to get him via in-game currency. Still sucks, but sucks less.
[2:50:36] <ToastyBroDude> Well in that case use the CAR SMG, it's insane for hipfire
[2:50:36] <bardicfire> Bloodhound is white, but also Non-Binary
[2:50:36] <42nfl19> Can you not do your half and half?
[2:50:39] <sjcodan> GO DRaNK
[2:50:43] <ghostravens> you take off bloodhound's mask and underneath is...another mask
[2:50:46] <apostateCourier> bloodhound is a human (?)
[2:50:47] <cyberbunbun> bloodhound is just a flock of crows
[2:50:50] <@mothmandraws> overwatch is slower
[2:50:52] <axivate_> @thebonebard I mean the devs actively said that they didn't want white guys in their games
[2:50:56] <@Menitta> It cant work here cuz it won't switch on the fly
[2:50:59] <@Menitta> right?
[2:51:01] <Shufflemang> @cyberbunbun This is my headcannon
[2:51:02] <apostateCourier> bloodhound is actually one of Odin's kids
[2:51:03] <+JayEarly> @thebonebard Well unfortunately for him the free market loves the commie sjw game LUL
[2:51:03] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> I'd like to think that bloodhound is just pyro from tf2
[2:51:04] <+thebonebard> @bardicfire wait do we know what she looks like
[2:51:05] <bardicfire> @axivate_ when?
[2:51:05] <donald371> Play it
[2:51:05] <+ChrisAlgoo> bloodhound is nonbinary goth raven representation and we are here for it
[2:51:13] <42nfl19> "water"

[2:51:20] <+JenovasPuppet> apatHoldon

[2:52:15] <turbofolk> And back to cringy shirts
[2:52:15] <+JustToWatch> are these shirts woolie's stand
[2:52:17] <@mothmandraws> just be quartering and complain there are too many women and non binary robots
[2:52:19] <Chocolate_Burrito> guess he added new shirts since the last time i saw the stream
[2:52:27] <@mothmandraws> the complaining about the robots was the dumbest comment
[2:52:29] <+thebonebard> @JayEarly i think josukes mom
[2:52:44] <%Skullgod> how come you get to be a mod moth
[2:52:46] <%Skullgod> :(

[2:53:09] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> "I'm not crying i'll fight you"
[2:53:10] <bardicfire> (yes I know I'm slow)
[2:53:10] <ghostravens> @SuttonOMEGA i literally saw someone wear one of these not too long ago

[2:53:18] <SuttonOMEGA> ghostravens OhGod
[2:53:21] <+ChrisAlgoo> gamers will always complain about characters who aren't white dudes, we just gotta move forward
[2:53:22] <tearknack> the worst bit about that fairy tail one is the shitty font
[2:53:30] <@mothmandraws> both of us neglected by punch dad
[2:53:32] <+JayEarly> @mothmandraws "Non-binary robot" is a ridiculous phrase for so many reasons

[2:55:21] <$Tuskor13> I can't get over these shirts they're so goodbad
[2:55:37] <+thebonebard> you know some of these wouldnt be that bad if it werent for the anime characters on them, more so these specific ones
[2:55:38] <+JustToWatch> I didn't fall out of hell, I crawled my way out of idaho
[2:55:44] <SuttonOMEGA> is there a link to buy these shirts? its not in the twitch description

[2:57:49] <ToastyBroDude> THE MENU
[2:57:51] <$TRILLTURBAN> nice
[2:57:52] <%Sxy_T_Rex> I just showed up, gotta get my ass into this!
[2:57:57] <+WhyIDie> 2hu network changes a man
[2:58:11] <sanctified_succ> softball is best weapon
[2:58:27] <+JenovasPuppet> What if they just keep adding features to Apex until it matches everything Titanfall has, essentially tricking people into playing Titanfall 3?
[2:58:29] <ToastyBroDude> nah man G2 all the way
[2:58:31] <ArchLightAce> do people still bitch about the softball?
[2:58:45] <+Andrizzleton> server?
[2:58:45] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:58:49] <TwentyCXII> The Softball is so fun
[2:58:50] <ArchLightAce> I remember people used to get super salt about it
[2:58:54] <sanctified_succ> g2 is a good second
[2:58:59] <sanctified_succ> LUL
[2:59:04] <UnfilteredComic> ppl get salt about anything
[2:59:11] <HeavyC4> in Titanfall 3, you better get the ability to run up buildings directly
[2:59:18] <bardicfire> never ADS with Alt, if you ADS you're doing it wrong
[2:59:22] <ToastyBroDude> also why is Woolie using the ACOG on the Alt?
[2:59:25] <Shufflemang> Grenadier weapons are a pretty common occurance.
[2:59:25] <ArchLightAce> I like the softball but I got a lot of complaints for it back in the day
[2:59:27] <@mothmandraws> titanfall 3 lets buildings run up pilots
[2:59:44] <@mothmandraws> RIP
[2:59:45] <juxtest> lol
[2:59:46] <bardicfire> @Shufflemang he probably doesn't use it at all and just has it on because he can
[2:59:47] <%Wonderbot3000> SPICY BOI
[2:59:47] <+WhyIDie> titanfall 3 will let you table hopper between people while in a mech
[2:59:48] <gryffinp> God, amped hardpoint is SO awful
[2:59:51] <$TRILLTURBAN> y tho
[2:59:51] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 3 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 12oz (360mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[2:59:52] <ToastyBroDude> SPICY
[2:59:53] <42nfl19> What is the better fck aiming weapon, alt or car?
[2:59:58] <+spikebomb5> wheres my 1st person tunneling mechanics?
[3:00:02] <HeavyC4> LUL
[3:00:03] <%ZombiLoin> Uh, CAR
[3:00:05] <%OranHexthief> rooSip
[3:00:06] <gryffinp> Don't worry hydration bot, we just took a hydration break
[3:00:09] <+YabbaTroll> how do you change data centers?
[3:00:11] <%ZombiLoin> CAR has a larger mag and less horizontal recoil
[3:00:18] <%ZombiLoin> It's basically a laser gun
[3:00:18] <ToastyBroDude> CAR forever
[3:00:19] <42nfl19> you go to the very main menu
[3:00:22] <%ZombiLoin> Maybe not as much as the volt
[3:00:23] <@Menitta> @Stay_Hydrated_Bot Good job. Not enough redbull
[3:00:27] <42nfl19> then bottom left you should see it
[3:00:29] <Heavensguard92> SMR for life boi
[3:00:33] <+YabbaTroll> @42nfl19 ye?
[3:00:40] <%ZombiLoin> If you want to use the boss-character of titanfall 2 use the R97
[3:00:43] <%ZombiLoin> it's busted OP
[3:00:48] <+YabbaTroll> @42nfl19 ah i see
[3:00:54] <%krispen_wa> what the hell is this apex legends clone?
[3:00:54] <+spikebomb5> playing pc with controllers LUL
[3:00:55] <@mothmandraws> giant robots are cool, I hope one day they make an anime about giant robots
[3:00:55] <+WhyIDie> they had the high ground FeelsBadMan
[3:00:58] <ToastyBroDude> @ZombiLoin CAR will fucking melt mofos
[3:00:59] <+FuhrerVonZephyr> Hmm
[3:00:59] <ArchLightAce> I usualy perfer the L Star to the SMR
[3:01:01] <+FuhrerVonZephyr> Maybe I'll try it
[3:01:08] <gryffinp> I use the car and it gives me imposter syndrome because it's so easy to kill with
[3:01:08] <%ZombiLoin> not as much as the R97, lol
[3:01:13] <ToastyBroDude> @ArchLightAce Dude L-Star is my most used!
[3:01:14] <Cthultist> Real late to the party here, is anything happening on PS4 or just PC?
[3:01:16] <%NumberTooBig> nice shootin woolz
[3:01:22] <Shufflemang> @zombiloin R97 isn't as OP as it used to be.
[3:01:24] <sanctified_succ> pc only rip
[3:01:27] <%ZombiLoin> if CAR is easy mode R97 is basically auto-attack
[3:01:28] <Cthultist> Damn
[3:01:28] <@Menitta> Is it me or is there something up with the sound
[3:01:30] <CoplandOS> run away from the giant robots
[3:01:34] <Heavensguard92> got so many hrs on SMR. it fights everything!
[3:01:37] <ToastyBroDude> @ZombiLoin I never see people use the R97, never tried
[3:01:42] <%ZombiLoin> I don't think they nerfed the R97
[3:01:50] <%ZombiLoin> BTW, perspectives differ
[3:01:51] <ArchLightAce> @ToastyBroDude The L-Star rules, especially with amped weapons
[3:01:52] <Twillrex> @Menitta it's doubled
[3:01:58] <ghostravens> MORTIS
[3:02:04] <NoirePanzer> Need that medicinal cocaine
[3:02:05] <@mothmandraws> when you try so hard and you dont succeed
[3:02:08] <%ZombiLoin> R97 on PC is very different in gameplay from R97 on console
[3:02:10] <sanctified_succ> smr+amp=doomed titan
[3:02:13] <+Nobrev> my loadout of choice is grapple, CAR, RE45, Thunderbolt, low profile, ordinance expert, and fire star
[3:02:16] <+critfumble_> i love the r97 but i think it hasnt been because omg
[3:02:20] <%ZombiLoin> it's probably pretty well balanced on ps4/xbox
[3:02:26] <ToastyBroDude> @ZombiLoin Oooooh ok, I play on PS4
[3:02:35] <%ZombiLoin> lmao that explains it
[3:02:43] <+xGnarlyCharlie> is PC still pretty active online?
[3:02:50] <%ZombiLoin> 2k-4k players
[3:02:50] <@mothmandraws> honestly an eva would be waaaay to big woolie
[3:02:51] <NoirePanzer> Gundam 07 crossover
[3:02:53] <+WhyIDie> AC4 mechs would wipe the floor with these mechs
[3:02:53] <haisho> Woolie seriously wants an EVA in Titanfall, huh?
[3:02:56] <Heavensguard92> Don't need anti titan if you have an smr lol.
[3:02:57] <@mothmandraws> unless they shrunk it
[3:02:58] <$TRILLTURBAN> why no Gundam color palette?
[3:03:01] <@mothmandraws> evas are like goofy big
[3:03:02] <bardicfire> maybe as cosmetics only, otherwise it would screw the meta
[3:03:02] <%MaiHusbando9S> just plop an Atlas down in that mess
[3:03:07] <gryffinp> I'm pretty happy with the game maintaining a consistent visual style
[3:03:08] <Reverend_Roscoe> eva-8 is a shitgun
[3:03:08] <cool_culainn> R97 is the shit
[3:03:19] <+YabbaTroll> cold war is life
[3:03:19] <%Zebroneath> Decals of Jehuty, Eva, or Gundams would have been neato.
[3:03:23] <ghostravens> gundam barbatos in titanfall
[3:03:26] <%ZombiLoin> tell woolie to use the G2
[3:03:26] <+paladinstarbuster> try again
[3:03:31] <%ZombiLoin> apparently the autoaim is pretty decent
[3:03:34] <@Menitta> Mastiff bois
[3:03:34] <%ZombiLoin> you just need to buttonmash
[3:03:35] <ToastyBroDude> L-STAR
[3:03:37] <%ZombiLoin> and ADS
[3:03:41] <nmkinkade> Rekt
[3:03:46] <CoplandOS> CAR is the most noob friendly weapon ever made
[3:03:48] <cool_culainn> What is the size ratio of a gundam to a Titan??
[3:03:51] <@mothmandraws> they should have put in imperial knight titans from 40k
[3:03:55] <ToastyBroDude> @ZombiLoin He should switch the scope first though
[3:03:58] <sanctified_succ> memestiff!
[3:04:02] <%ZombiLoin> mhm
[3:04:03] <@mothmandraws> gundams are about 2x the size I think
[3:04:05] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> r-97, charge rifle with quick charge, wingman - wreck shit
[3:04:12] <+MrFlyingMongoose123> The nice part about the EVA is that you don't have to aim
[3:04:14] <@Menitta> EVA 8 is good. Im a mastiff guy myself
[3:04:14] <+griffball13> Put some Dreadnaughts in
[3:04:15] <@mothmandraws> EVA units are like 40 times the size
[3:04:21] <@mothmandraws> if not more
[3:04:22] <+WhyIDie> a gundam would probably be able to punt these mechs
[3:04:25] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> as a bonus the quick charge rifle is anti personnel at any range
[3:04:26] <Shufflemang> Just run em over with the CAR :)
[3:04:30] <%OranHexthief> maybe if they go full birtual training as the lore for titanfall 3 we could get some crossovers
[3:04:30] <+Mushinronja> that's why you never use that ability to hover in place
[3:04:31] <+FuhrerVonZephyr> Yeah, titans are tiny
[3:04:37] <%OranHexthief> virtual*
[3:04:37] <@Menitta> That guy;s name is Medical_Cocaine
[3:04:39] <@mothmandraws> eva units are 75 meters tall
[3:04:44] <@mothmandraws> 40k warlord titans are only 33
[3:04:53] <@mothmandraws> even imperator titans are 47 ish
[3:04:55] <Heavensguard92> gundams are probably like 10 or so feet taller
[3:04:57] <%Zebroneath> Yeah, A Titan is about the size of an Eva's foot or close enough to it.
[3:04:59] <@mothmandraws> evas are really big
[3:05:02] <%ZombiLoin> evas are really tall as far as mechas go lol
[3:05:15] <+FuhrerVonZephyr> I feel like that'sa suboptimal spot for that turret, but I dont really know where else I'd put it in that room
[3:05:20] <+shinonion> Does titanfall 2 still go on sale for pc?
[3:05:22] <tonysonartanim> Gundams are comparitively small and transformers are TINY
[3:05:36] <%ZombiLoin> you can pay for like
[3:05:37] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> you can literally play tf2 for 5 bucks
[3:05:40] <Tucker0603> I'd wanna be in a Imperial Knight
[3:05:44] <ToastyBroDude> um?
[3:05:49] <@mothmandraws> a zaku is about 17 meters tall
[3:05:49] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:05:49] <%ZombiLoin> 5 bucks for origin access basic
[3:05:51] <%ZombiLoin> and it comes with tf2
[3:05:53] <axivate_> @WoolieVersus Are you aware your payment account is still super best friends play?
[3:05:58] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> exactly
[3:06:01] <Heavensguard92> WALL RUN BOI
[3:06:05] <cool_culainn> Huh, cause I just rematches big o and was kinda surprised how small it is to a gundam
[3:06:05] <NoirePanzer> HE DO IT
[3:06:16] <+Irridium> Think the deluxe edition on PS4 is on sale for like $10 right now
[3:06:17] <MavMarsh> that's a bad wall
[3:06:20] <@Menitta> and the L Star
[3:06:22] <+allups> any meta or ranking tips for people tht wanna get back in
[3:06:25] <+WhyIDie> you weren't coward enough to survive FeelsBadMan
[3:06:29] <$TRILLTURBAN> slopey wall not good wall
[3:06:30] <+critfumble_> my favourite mech is the ACU from supreme commander and that bad boy is 90m tall
[3:06:36] <gryffinp> Shoot good; don't get shoot
[3:06:48] <Pablo_Gonzalo> it worked until it didn't
[3:07:06] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> I can only share my setup, which is c4 charges, low profile and cloak
[3:07:14] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> it just works against everything
[3:07:19] <Shufflemang> @allups Ion is your best friend now.
[3:07:23] <Heavensguard92> really dislike the small magazine the legion has
[3:07:33] <Someguy893> I <3 ion
[3:07:38] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> but then legion just has infinite ammo for a bit
[3:07:38] <todestag91> is he on superbestfriendsplay network? first time playing online
[3:07:39] <mayorrev> good try
[3:07:39] <ToastyBroDude> ALMOST COOL;

[3:08:10] <+allups> thanks for the tip @Shufflemang
[3:08:14] <ghostravens> i want a barbatos like titan, that would be cool
[3:08:17] <sanctified_succ> cap the flag
[3:08:17] <ToastyBroDude> ctf
[3:08:19] <%OranHexthief> your look sensitivity seems a little low. might want to bump it up one or two notches if it doesn't feel too strange for you woolie
[3:08:29] <mandjelo> what oran said
[3:08:37] <+allups> any have the mountain dew skin
[3:08:41] <%cervidaequus> @woolieversus are you getting a discord sometime? i wanna shitpost my sub emotes on unrelated servers
[3:08:44] <mayorrev> awww
[3:09:02] <panjin79> I bought this game cuz Woolie told me to
[3:09:02] <+BenevolentBeetle> yoshis cookie
[3:09:07] <+BenevolentBeetle> crambled
[3:09:08] <+WhyIDie> drop one combo, lose the round
[3:09:10] <+The_Gen_Eric> That's the way the Woolie crumbles
[3:09:11] <+Talbz> Hey, this isn't Apex
[3:09:12] <mayorrev> D:
[3:09:13] <mandjelo> Thats how it goes in this bitch of a titanfall
[3:09:16] <%djinnJuice> I'm fighting warframe movement habits so hard
[3:09:18] <%djinnJuice> it's painful
[3:09:25] <+BenevolentBeetle> Carnivore lookin mofo
[3:09:26] <CoplandOS> @Talbz It's better ;)
[3:09:27] <layssaltflavour> i played this game a shit ton on ps4 is it fine to buy it again on pc?
[3:09:35] <+BenevolentBeetle> half man half predator
[3:09:36] <+critfumble_> dude same the c to crouch and not v is killing me
[3:09:42] <+Talbz> @CoplandOS Trust me I know
[3:09:44] <+FuhrerVonZephyr> @layssaltflavour Eh, the population is kinda dying
[3:09:49] <%djinnJuice> the real one is the aim
[3:09:51] <weird_blue_dude> @WoolieVersus Have you played Transistor?
[3:09:53] <IllogicalFlower> what kit are you using on legion?
[3:09:57] <mayorrev> Slide, longjump, double, divekick
[3:09:57] <Tucker0603> yep
[3:09:59] <%djinnJuice> going down sights while doing the slide hop shenanigans is bad
[3:10:01] <+The_Lunar_Paladin> @woolieversus I played a ton of this a few days back and went to Apex with some friends, that was not a fun transition
[3:10:02] <gryffinp> Titanfall and Warframe both want you to hit the crouch button before you land, but in totally different ways
[3:10:02] <@mothmandraws> ?
[3:10:03] <ToastyBroDude> @WoolieVersus If you want to use the Alternator, use a different sight, the ACOG zooms in way too much for you
[3:10:13] <+WhyIDie> wallrunning feels a lot more stilted in warframe, but bulletjumping and sliding on landing is great
[3:10:13] <@Menitta> SkullyG is the most shitposter
[3:10:16] <+chrishnaw> !uptime
[3:10:16] <@mothmandraws> its all ogre for skull
[3:10:16] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 10 minutes
[3:10:19] <$TRILLTURBAN> Scorch is best boi
[3:10:20] <bardicfire> dont zoom at all
[3:10:23] <bardicfire> learn to hipfire
[3:10:26] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> as a northstar player, I love scorch
[3:10:27] <sanctified_succ> Papa's kitchen
[3:10:29] <%Agami23> charging fucking star.
[3:10:31] <bardicfire> Alt has best hipfire hands down
[3:10:33] <%DeathsDoom> Tone
[3:10:37] <ToastyBroDude> @bardicfire but this is Woolie though
[3:10:38] <+AppleBasket> why pick a slow titan in a game about moving fast?
[3:10:40] <+FuhrerVonZephyr> I've always liked Tone, but Nothstar is very fun
[3:10:43] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> just kinda fly over it and railgun its fine sensitive areas
[3:10:46] <+allups> @WoolieVersus u try tht new game dusk? u can do back flips and front flips
[3:10:47] <+The_Lunar_Paladin> Tone is the gurl, best Titan
[3:10:48] <+critfumble_> alt best hipfire? r97 would like a word
[3:10:52] <+AppleBasket> though Scorch is pretty sexy
[3:10:55] <+FuhrerVonZephyr> And monarch
[3:10:58] <42nfl19> Wait where was the countdown?
[3:11:06] <+FuhrerVonZephyr> If you can chain titan executions, the battery steal is very strong
[3:11:08] <%djinnJuice> he didn't count lol
[3:11:08] <+goose_attack_almanac> @WoolieVersus Shoutout to my simulacrum girl Ashe. She a sick biddy but she mine
[3:11:14] <ToastyBroDude> Monarch is the best yo dont @ me BRO
[3:11:15] <%OranHexthief> i have played way too much monarch honestly
[3:11:27] <%djinnJuice> monarch is very fun
[3:11:31] <%djinnJuice> Ion also good
[3:11:32] <bardicfire> also I would like to say FUUUUUUUCK Auto Pistol users.
[3:11:33] <%djinnJuice> and ronin
[3:11:33] <Heavensguard92> Monarch is strong, if it survives long enough
[3:11:40] <mandjelo> it goes monarch, legion, northstar, ronin, the others
[3:11:44] <42nfl19> SkullGod don't forget to do the countdown
[3:11:48] <ToastyBroDude> @Heavensguard92 That's the risk that makes her SO GOOD
[3:11:52] <%Jensegaense> goddamn Hackout is a lucky one getting like 4-5 matches in a row with Woolz
[3:11:55] <+critfumble_> i love ion
[3:12:05] <Tucker0603> did Woolie change data centers?
[3:12:05] <@mothmandraws> he got a kill
[3:12:07] <ToastyBroDude> If you get that LVL 3 damage and fire rate upgrade, holy shit you will melt mofos
[3:12:15] <+patriotrenegade> @woolieversus Are ya winning, son?
[3:12:15] <Megatome> augh ctf in tif2 is so polarizing ahah
[3:12:16] <Heavensguard92> @ToastyBroDude So true, it what makes her so good in frontier defense.
[3:12:16] <sjcodan> I've done it multiple times!
[3:12:21] <%Jensegaense> YEAH I'M A REAL FAN
[3:12:21] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> im not sue how to join
[3:12:21] <@mothmandraws> should have pre reloaded
[3:12:24] <MavMarsh> scoreboard?
[3:12:25] <@mothmandraws> you would have got him
[3:12:26] <@Menitta> LUL
[3:12:27] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> but I can pretend
[3:12:27] <Tucker0603> I killed ya woolz
[3:12:28] <+Irridium> I've killed him multiple times like the true fan I am
[3:12:29] <+Shampoohyay> definitely get the quick reload mod when you unlock it
[3:12:30] <+d00msdaydan> styled on
[3:12:31] <sjcodan> That WAS shotgun range
[3:12:31] <ToastyBroDude> YEAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[3:12:31] <42TheNewbie> YEYEYEYE
[3:12:31] <+WhyIDie> here's your chance to walk away with a dread
[3:12:33] <xeros720> stylin on him
[3:12:34] <tubeman642> I play on xbox woolz
[3:12:35] <@mothmandraws> you had him there twice tbf
[3:12:37] <ghostravens> grapple bois
[3:12:38] <SixthSun2> You make it all too easy woolie
[3:12:38] <sjcodan> it shoots further than you think
[3:12:40] <sosuke5> Oh no, he's cool
[3:12:41] <+paladinstarbuster> DAS BOOT
[3:12:41] <%Wonderbot3000> I tried but I have to go to work soon so I cant
[3:12:42] <$TRILLTURBAN> Rodeo boi
[3:12:44] <Sirius140> Wonder if woolie has seen legion's gun hazard skin, think he'd like it?
[3:12:44] <jase__x> KICK
[3:12:52] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> the server browser got changed a lot since I played
[3:12:52] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[3:12:53] <bardicfire> nice
[3:12:55] <@mothmandraws> woolie getting the kills
[3:12:57] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> I guess
[3:12:57] <sanctified_succ> ooo
[3:13:00] <@Menitta> I love that name so much
[3:13:01] <Heavensguard92> Levels monarch so strong in frontier. But I can't leave my Scorch or Ronin alone too long
[3:13:03] <jase__x> gotta love the grappling hook
[3:13:03] <+FuhrerVonZephyr> I think I have 3 or 4 kills on Woolz at this point
[3:13:04] <@mothmandraws> a shotgun boi is born
[3:13:18] <+FuhrerVonZephyr> He got me a few times too tho, so it's all good
[3:13:20] <%Jensegaense> Shotguns are the best in any game
[3:13:31] <%Jensegaense> If your game has a bad shotgun it is a faliure
[3:13:33] <$Tuskor13> you know an online multiplayer fps is good when you dont mind getting killed because the killcam will be hype 100% of the time
[3:13:35] <haisho> HE FINALLY DID IT
[3:13:36] <$TRILLTURBAN> Nice

[3:13:53] <+Irridium> fuckin' denied
[3:13:57] <Pablo_Gonzalo> perfect
[3:13:58] <Unlimited_Coffee_Works> CRAZY TALK HAS SPREAD
[3:13:58] <+chrishnaw> I tried the TF2 demo on my PC and it wouldn't boot ;_;
[3:14:00] <mayorrev> Woolie you're really selling me on this game honestly, if you plan on having more game nights i'd love to hop in
[3:14:00] <jase__x> CRAZY TALK
[3:14:01] <$TRILLTURBAN> It's ok u got the clip for the montage
[3:14:01] <Shufflemang> POG
[3:14:01] <%OranHexthief> should have dropped the titan as distraction
[3:14:02] <@mothmandraws> can you land a titan on another titan
[3:14:04] <ToastyBroDude> CRAZY TALK
[3:14:05] <bardicfire> Titanfall in a nutshell, feel like a cool guy, bnut someone else was cooler
[3:14:09] <+WhyIDie> you jinxed yourself when you were giggling while running away
[3:14:14] <+Shampoohyay> i want woolie to try a grenadier, but he'd probably just kill himself considering he's still spending so much time on the ground
[3:14:23] <+JenovasPuppet> GET FUCKED
[3:14:31] <%Jensegaense> I think Woolie would like the SMR
[3:14:34] <+goose_attack_almanac> NEVER GIVE UP, NEvER SURRENDER
[3:14:34] <bardicfire> Does Woolie even know about Slide Hopping?
[3:14:35] <Megatome> @WoolieVersus that electric smoke is really good vs ronin as a heads up
[3:14:35] <$Tuskor13> yikes
[3:14:36] <TheAmazingClaytor> Eyyyy, Titanfall 2!
[3:14:37] <+chrishnaw> Not doing the controller+mouse combo in Titanfall?
[3:14:38] <Heavensguard92> Ronins!
[3:14:43] <SixthSun2> Swatted like a fly on the wall
[3:14:46] <VVerewolfJones> I was prepared for Titanfall, I get Wooliefall
[3:14:48] <@Menitta> Grapple is da bes
[3:14:51] <+critfumble_> goosing people with ion is THE most satisfying thing in this game no question
[3:14:54] <xeros720> surrendering is okay sometimes!
[3:14:56] <ToastyBroDude> stop trying to look cool with good Ronins around
[3:15:01] <+allups> grapple is all u need
[3:15:01] <Shufflemang> Grapple in this game is OP as hell.
[3:15:06] <Heavensguard92> Weird way to spell Stim!
[3:15:08] <bearwagon> rip missed the first 3 hours
[3:15:09] <Megatome> woolie falls directly into hell
[3:15:21] <ArchLightAce> thats ronin baby
[3:15:22] <bardicfire> @critfumble_ you've never goosed someone with Scorch then
[3:15:22] <$TRILLTURBAN> that's ronin
[3:15:24] <+goose_attack_almanac> WeebCore is real
[3:15:28] <sanctified_succ> @critfumble_ counterclaim: goosing with Papa scorch
[3:15:36] <Megatome> it really isn't @Shufflemang , all of the tacticals in this game are pretty alright balance wise
[3:15:38] <@mothmandraws> carry skull
[3:15:39] <CoplandOS> when you see 5 titans thats when you pull out the archer ;)
[3:15:42] <%Jensegaense> Woolie dying to cocain. A possible vision of the future?
[3:15:44] <Megatome> except for cloaking, which is complete garbage
[3:15:45] <@mothmandraws> its what woolie pays you $5 for
[3:15:57] <ToastyBroDude> EPG
[3:15:58] <+paladinstarbuster> always switch to secondary
[3:15:59] <Unlimited_Coffee_Works> Do your best, do your best, do it every day~
[3:16:00] <sjcodan> TRY THE MASTIF IF YOU WANT MORE RaNGE
[3:16:00] <Heavensguard92> @CoplandOS nah sun, that leaves you too vulnerable.. go thunderbolt
[3:16:03] <@mothmandraws> woolie just always hit reload psot fight
[3:16:04] <+WhyIDie> gotta make your movement less predictable, not doing yourself favors with low sensitivity
[3:16:04] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> nah I use cloaking
[3:16:05] <%MaiHusbando9S> never start shooting early, very disappointing
[3:16:06] <+FuhrerVonZephyr> @WoolieVersus The extended mag abd speed reloader is vital for the EVA-8
[3:16:08] <+allups> u always wanan stuff em with it whmn u can
[3:16:12] <ArchLightAce> Amped EPG is wack
[3:16:13] <+critfumble_> dont worry i love my big uncle scorch, but theres something in the snap of the laser and the just STOP of momentum thats just the best with ion
[3:16:16] <Megatome> you're all fools, mag launcher
[3:16:17] <+allups> wanna*
[3:16:18] <CoplandOS> @Heavensguard92 doesnt sound like the top damage anti titan weapon to me
[3:16:23] <+Shampoohyay> extended mag and tactikill work well if you know how to reload cancel
[3:16:23] <haisho> man this stream is just people jinxing themselves
[3:16:28] <ToastyBroDude> Mag launcher forever bro
[3:16:28] <bardicfire> @WoolieVersus do you know Slide Hopping?
[3:16:31] <Shufflemang> @megatome >grapple isn't OP Swinging across the map and spawn killing everyone on the opposing team says hi.
[3:16:42] <TheAmazingClaytor> EVA-8 + Cloak + Silenced Pistol = TF2 Spy
[3:16:51] <Heavensguard92> @CoplandOS it isn't but you alive as you constantly dash shots
[3:16:52] <Megatome> what is that, on console? I've never had issues with grapplers
[3:16:55] <NJigglypuff> ughhh why is this games pilot movement so good
[3:16:58] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @paladinstarbuster
[3:17:02] <@mothmandraws> go woolie
[3:17:04] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> cloaking is not ideal vs pilots but makes titans free. normally you can do much with that but the c4 charges and rewinds wreck all that shit
[3:17:08] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> its all about synergy
[3:17:09] <+chrishnaw> Is the floor lava?
[3:17:15] <+Shampoohyay> no time
[3:17:17] <@mothmandraws> oh no
[3:17:18] <CoplandOS> @Heavensguard92 you just gotta be a sneaky boi
[3:17:18] <$Tuskor13> booo
[3:17:20] <sanctified_succ> grapple is very open, but it would ruin the game imo if they nerfed it to one charge
[3:17:22] <xeros720> haha, so lame
[3:17:22] <ToastyBroDude> yikes
[3:17:23] <%strugglepunk2> RIP
[3:17:26] <ArchLightAce> RIP
[3:17:26] <thecrispyones> BibleThump
[3:17:28] <+Shampoohyay> i want them to bring back the floor is lava mode from titanfall 1
[3:17:29] <$Superdandy96> Pull your... Titan trigger? Does that work?
[3:17:30] <haisho> CTF is all about efficient routing if you're flag runner
[3:17:30] <sanctified_succ> *op
[3:17:33] <+Shampoohyay> :c
[3:17:34] <%Zebroneath> Such as it is
[3:17:35] <$Tuskor13> That's the Cross Tekken lameout
[3:17:35] <%OranHexthief> also it pays to snipe titans from afar with the laser
[3:17:36] <InkyDraconian> NOT GOOD NUT
[3:17:36] <Heavensguard92> @CoplandOS lol truuuuueeee
[3:17:40] <xeros720> the referee conspiring against woolie
[3:17:44] <+YabbaTroll> my life goal is to murder woolie wearing full fishsticks
[3:17:51] <+JenovasPuppet> Put that on the box "What a fucking bonerkill" -Woolie Madden
[3:17:52] <+Shampoohyay> that's devilish
[3:17:53] <+Shampoohyay> i like it
[3:17:53] <+chrishnaw> !! BONER AT RISK !!
[3:17:54] <MyNameIsRasus> Unleash the Titan that's within me
[3:17:55] <Shufflemang> @megatome It's more an issue on PC, but the speeds that can be attained with grapple exceed Stim from what I remember.
[3:17:57] <@mothmandraws> an ambitious dream yabba
[3:18:07] <MyNameIsRasus> No hiding in the Titans anymore
[3:18:08] <+Shampoohyay> grapple can be really game breaking in the right hands
[3:18:11] <@mothmandraws> woolie you legit get way more work done with this gun
[3:18:14] <+AppleBasket> EVA - our lord and savior
[3:18:18] <+Shampoohyay> sometimes literally so, you can go fast enough for hit to fail to register
[3:18:19] <VVerewolfJones> Flame Manatee sounds like a shit Megaman boss
[3:18:22] <ghostravens> is peacekeeper in titanfall 2? i forget
[3:18:25] <+Shampoohyay> sadly no
[3:18:26] <@Menitta> OOOh
[3:18:26] <+AppleBasket> pull my shotgun trigger - BANG BANG BANG
[3:18:29] <%Jensegaense> It has to be Cold War Fishticks though, Yabba
[3:18:29] <mayorrev> GET NOSCOPED
[3:18:30] <+Andrizzleton> eva absolute unit 1
[3:18:36] <+Shampoohyay> i need more lever actions aaa
[3:18:38] <sjcodan> THATS ME
[3:18:41] <+WhyIDie> everytime he gets caught on a ledge or the side of the wall, the sonic drowning music starts playing in my head monkaS
[3:18:42] <Heavensguard92> Woolie has fully converted to the precursor to leadwall
[3:18:59] <xeros720> woolie just needs to embrace the scrub tactics to win
[3:19:07] <@mothmandraws> woolie shotgun allows for less aim focus and plays more to aggression
[3:19:07] <ArchLightAce> the mastiff is the precursor to the leadwall
[3:19:08] <NJigglypuff> play to win
[3:19:09] <bardicfire> EVA might be the best shotgun in any game
[3:19:12] <+The_Lunar_Paladin> Just wait for the run and gun ability Woolie
[3:19:15] <ArchLightAce> don't get it twisted
[3:19:17] <+AppleBasket> shotgun works better with Stim anyway
[3:19:23] <+Shampoohyay> someone tell woolie to use awall and spitfire Kappa
[3:19:23] <%Jensegaense> Running+Shotgun has always been one of the best combos. Just look at Scout from TF2 (The other one)
[3:19:24] <@mothmandraws> @WoolieVersus always be reloading
[3:19:28] <Heavensguard92> STim eva
[3:19:30] <%Agami23> take out your pistol for distance woolie @WoolieVersus
[3:19:50] <@mothmandraws> any downtime is reload time
[3:19:53] <CoplandOS> wingman elite <3

[3:20:04] <+Shampoohyay> woolie this YOUR BASE
[3:20:07] <mayorrev> 200 IQ
[3:20:11] <+Shampoohyay> he's waiting for the damn flag to be returned
[3:20:12] <UnfilteredComic> @WoolieVersus Cant cap while the flag is gone
[3:20:14] <+Andrizzleton> avoiding the map hack
[3:20:15] <+critfumble_> he cant cap without flag being home
[3:20:19] <42nfl19> You need both flag woolie
[3:20:23] <%Jensegaense> can't collect the flag if your own is missing
[3:20:32] <%ImperiusMex> you cant score when the enemie has your flag @WoolieVersus
[3:20:35] <+AppleBasket> Woolie! Try the L-STAR with it's extended Mag
[3:20:39] <+AppleBasket> it's a beautiful gun
[3:20:41] <42nfl19> Woolie he has to wait till his flag is back
[3:20:45] <+Shampoohyay> niiice
[3:20:54] <alwayspronking> THE RUNBACK
[3:20:54] <+Shampoohyay> woolie didn't even register the flag was in his base lol...
[3:21:08] <Heavensguard92> The comback, the backdown
[3:21:28] <+FuhrerVonZephyr> LMG
[3:21:29] <Foodfordagods> hey yall Tf2 ult is in sale in PS store for 7$
[3:21:29] <+Shampoohyay> LMG
[3:21:30] <+Irridium> light machine gun
[3:21:38] <$TRILLTURBAN> LMG
[3:21:38] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus the L-Star is my baby
[3:21:46] <HebbieJebbies> Oh hey it's that awesome game
[3:21:46] <+JenovasPuppet> LUL
[3:21:46] <+Shampoohyay> >auto-titan
[3:21:49] <+Shampoohyay> oof
[3:21:52] <%djinnJuice> @WoolieVersus seriously give mosambique a shot
[3:21:54] <+YabbaTroll> lmg
[3:21:54] <+CreakySkelly> it's still great
[3:22:03] <+Shampoohyay> for fun!!
[3:22:03] <@mothmandraws> why is skull not pinging out extended heavy mag lvl 2 to woolie
[3:22:05] <+AppleBasket> the L -STAR never reloads, it's a heat mechanic powerful gun
[3:22:11] <+paladinstarbuster> USE YOUR TITAN WEAPON
[3:22:13] <@Menitta> You should at least try the Mastiff tho
[3:22:15] <$TRILLTURBAN> bc variety is the spice of life
[3:22:16] <sjcodan> STICK WITH SHOTGUNS
[3:22:19] <layssaltflavour> try the mastiff
[3:22:21] <Shufflemang> Mozambique isn't as good as it used to be, but it's still good.
[3:22:40] <Doc2722> Slapped
[3:22:42] <+AppleBasket> you can kill titans with the L STAR, it's that powerful
[3:22:44] <+WhatTheFlox> nice still goin strong
[3:22:45] <+YabbaTroll> you would do well with the lstar, it has BIG bullets @WoolieVersus
[3:22:45] <sjcodan> WRONG
[3:22:51] <ArchLightAce> what???
[3:22:52] <42nfl19> I never understood why they made the mozambique a primary weapon
[3:22:52] <+chrishnaw> Use your HF blade
[3:22:53] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus the L-star, SMR, and Mastiff are my personal favorites
[3:22:54] <%Jensegaense> I hate how you have to unlock the mods for weapons. Really makes you use unfun versions of the guns for the first hours of play with them
[3:22:54] <sjcodan> BIG WRONG
[3:22:54] <bardicfire> BIG LIES
[3:22:55] <sanctified_succ> VERY WRONG
[3:22:56] <CoplandOS> pffft say that to a scorch main
[3:22:56] <Tucker0603> WRONG
[3:23:01] <+FuhrerVonZephyr> @WoolieVersus Also remember to slap an extended mag on your shotgun
[3:23:06] <bardicfire> B I G H U G E L I E S
[3:23:08] <%aishman> Is he playing on PC or in the PS4?
[3:23:09] <sjcodan> LEGION EXCELS AT PILOT KILLS
[3:23:15] <Axonn1018> leveling up pistols was annoying
[3:23:16] <+AppleBasket> Woolie, use LEGION's RB to kill pilots, it's a guaranteed kill at any range
[3:23:22] <Tucker0603> @coplandos hi, I'm the scorch man
[3:23:23] <sjcodan> GEN 13 LEGION HERE
[3:23:26] <@mothmandraws> hes on pc
[3:23:28] <Heavensguard92> Reccommend Thunderbolt so he gets titan faster
[3:23:28] <Shufflemang> >Legion is terrible at killing people on foot CRAZY TALK: ACTIVATED
[3:23:33] <%aishman> Also yeah, Legion is amazing at killing pilots
[3:23:40] <bardicfire> i dont even play Legion and I know thats Lies
[3:23:54] <xeros720> an attempt was made
[3:23:55] <layssaltflavour> doesnt legion have a close range weapon?
[3:23:57] <@mothmandraws> but ye you did good on the shotugns
[3:23:58] <+Shampoohyay> pro tip
[3:24:02] <sjcodan> YEYEYE EVA
[3:24:02] <+AppleBasket> Legion's right bumper shot is overpowered at killing pilots
[3:24:13] <+Shampoohyay> when you're in close range mode, legion's power shot is a guaranteed hit within a certain close-ish range
[3:24:17] <+Shampoohyay> guaranteed kill on pilots
[3:24:24] <+Shampoohyay> as long as they're inside your crosshairs
[3:24:29] <gryffinp> I... did it.
[3:24:30] <%Jensegaense> Woolie REALLY needs to unlock the Gunrunner mod for EVA
[3:24:46] <sjcodan> Legion kills pilots for breakfast
[3:24:48] <TheAmazingClaytor> Bottom of the board for Woolie.
[3:24:51] <@mothmandraws> woolie needs a shotgun titan
[3:24:55] <%aishman> Also Woolie, is this PS4 or Orising?
[3:24:58] <%Jensegaense> Gunrunner just lets you continue to run while your shooting the gun
[3:25:00] <%yeknomlive> just played the horde mode. also pretty fun
[3:25:02] <gryffinp> Shotgun titan exists, his name is Ronin
[3:25:04] <+Shampoohyay> woolie needs to learn to wallrun because gunrunner is for groundlets
[3:25:05] <Heavensguard92> Shotgun titan? soundsl ike a RONIN!
[3:25:05] <@mothmandraws> put on that ammo
[3:25:09] <@Menitta> Gunrunner is essential
[3:25:13] <@mothmandraws> scop lvl 3 here
[3:25:16] <+Shampoohyay> you don't need gun runner if you learn to wallrun and slide hop
[3:25:19] <+Hamblasto> @woolieversus You planning on having another one of these nights?
[3:25:22] <sanctified_succ> thunderbolt!
[3:25:31] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus the l-star is great for never reloading
[3:25:36] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @bardicfire
[3:25:41] <+orlandocastro> are you gonna play the PS4 version too
[3:25:43] <Shufflemang> Also, Legion's close range power shot does more damage and has a larger range than his long shot for some reason. I don't know if they changed that tho.
[3:25:46] <bardicfire> Switch your anti titan with your Side Arm
[3:25:47] <Doc2722> Legion blows use Grill Daddy to comit some war crimes.
[3:25:52] <%yeknomlive> he already try r97
[3:25:53] <bardicfire> so you can draw it faster!
[3:25:56] <+WhatTheFlox> definitely need more of this
[3:25:57] <+AppleBasket> LSTAR can literally kill titans, pilots, never have to reload if you don't overheat
[3:25:57] <Good_Snacks> I love the fact that you're playing this over Apex
[3:25:58] <+Shampoohyay> close range power shot does a truckload of damage up close, yeah
[3:25:59] <+secretspud> The Devotion is one of my favorite guns in any shooter ever. I'd suck that guns dick.
[3:26:07] <Marhunter7> @WoolieVersus The mastiff with gun runner is hilarious fun, but it takes alot of getting used to
[3:26:08] <Nyckelus> YO, L Star is my fave weapon!
[3:26:08] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus the L-Star is my baby, it's awesome
[3:26:08] <+WhyIDie> if you're trying to build more ground swell on this franchise, more nights would be recommended
[3:26:09] <CityKani> whatchu snacking on wools?
[3:26:10] <@mothmandraws> wow woolie rage quitting
[3:26:15] <CoplandOS> @WoolieVersus i dont think capture the flag is too popular on pc
[3:26:16] <+Shampoohyay> it doesn't have more range though, it's literally a range and FOV check to hit targets
[3:26:21] <JanusII> I love L-STAR but I'm a P90 fetishist.
[3:26:21] <+Shampoohyay> long range power shot is a physical projectile
[3:26:24] <42nfl19> Dont forget countdown!
[3:26:26] <+allups> Id like to see him play some older MP games. i know he liked Gunz
[3:26:30] <vierleger> I can't play because I'm in D&D right now, but I'm still watching this. Hopefully next one I'll be able to play.
[3:26:45] <%Skullgod> 5
[3:26:46] <%Skullgod> 4
[3:26:47] <%Skullgod> 3
[3:26:48] <%Skullgod> 2
[3:26:57] <%ZombiLoin> does woolie put up the vods later, btw?
[3:26:57] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:27:00] <%Jensegaense> I think once you connect with people the game prefers to connect you with them
[3:27:14] <bardicfire> Arc is Objectively the best
[3:27:15] <Shufflemang> I think Woolie would've enjoyed Tribes Ascend if Hi-Rez didn't kill it.
[3:27:17] <%yeknomlive> also blinds titans
[3:27:18] <alwayspronking> Its a stun and a slow, its very nasty
[3:27:19] <+allups> @ZombiLoin yes
[3:27:23] <%ZombiLoin> aight neat
[3:27:31] <%ZombiLoin> i wanna see that grapple melee from his perspective, lol
[3:27:40] <bardicfire> the others have their uses but Arc is just all around fantastic
[3:27:49] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus th L-Star is great with the gravel star
[3:27:49] <+AppleBasket> ARC is best grenade by far
[3:27:53] <+Nobrev> low profile is the best
[3:27:54] <%Jensegaense> Firestar 4 Life
[3:27:54] <+AppleBasket> stunning titans is insane
[3:27:58] <sjcodan> WOO, GO SKITTLE
[3:28:06] <Doc2722> Grav star with the lmg you can also cuck nuke ejecters in their mech.
[3:28:07] <sanctified_succ> rip
[3:28:08] <+allups> im ena thy might just noit be in the clan'
[3:28:16] <%ZombiLoin> eh switching to just attrition wont solve the problem
[3:28:21] <Shufflemang> Arc Grenade isn't as good as it used to be. It sticks and explodes on a timer as opposed to exploding on impact like it used to. Frag grenade is better now.
[3:28:22] <%ZombiLoin> stick to lower pop playlists lioke amped and ctf
[3:28:30] <%ZombiLoin> mayube play a little PVP, you can fit 16 people in there
[3:28:32] <%ZombiLoin> for maximum peopl
[3:28:34] <+AppleBasket> they nerfed ARC!?
[3:28:37] <+AppleBasket> dead game
[3:28:43] <%ZombiLoin> though i guess at that point you dont have any titans in game
[3:28:45] <%yeknomlive> you dont have to go easy on these guys no
[3:28:47] <%yeknomlive> now
[3:29:22] <misteralex412> maybe do Bounty hunt?
[3:29:22] <Marhunter7> If / When they make a titan fall 3, i really hope they don't make grenade launchers a primary weapon slot again. almost everyone uses them and they suck to play against
[3:29:23] <+YabbaTroll> you could create a private mtach
[3:29:26] <+YabbaTroll> i think
[3:29:34] <vierleger> woah, I didn't know you could do that in the corner
[3:29:41] <limeyprick> ello wrongcocks
[3:29:49] <%ZombiLoin> nani
[3:29:58] <%ZombiLoin> grenadier weapons are the actual skill weapons in titanfall
[3:30:00] <%ImperiusMex> Is woolie playing alone?>
[3:30:13] <%Jensegaense> He's playing with Skullgod
[3:30:14] <rsg220> greandier weapons are basically quake guns
[3:30:21] <bardicfire> really gotta learn to just hipfire man
[3:30:25] <%ImperiusMex> i dont see skull in the game
[3:30:26] <bardicfire> changes the game completely
[3:30:30] <+YabbaTroll> is this on pc? the networks look differentfrom my perspective
[3:30:36] <%ZombiLoin> yeah, its on pc
[3:30:39] <Nyckelus> @zombiloin Softball and EPG are really good weapons that very few people use.
[3:30:40] <+YabbaTroll> huh
[3:30:41] <+YabbaTroll> odd
[3:30:47] <nepwar> god I cant wait till i have good connection to get on titanfall
[3:30:56] <%ZombiLoin> a lot people don't use them because they're kinda difficult
[3:30:57] <Marhunter7> @ZombiLoin They could be, they're just not very fun to play against i think.
[3:30:58] <TheAmazingClaytor> Das a wipeout
[3:30:59] <+SeaBassTheLad> yeah PC mouse+kb people dont fuck around
[3:30:59] <%Jensegaense> EPG gets used a ton
[3:31:04] <%Skullgod> im not in the game lol
[3:31:05] <%ZombiLoin> in comparison to CAR or R97
[3:31:06] <%yuribo26> Man, Apex looks weird, the mechs seem unnecessary
[3:31:11] <%Skullgod> i wanna see how long it takes for him to realise
[3:31:11] <megaminimechamocha> Excellent, I joined the stream just in time to see Woolie get destroyed

[3:34:05] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[3:34:16] <bardicfire> @WoolieVersus switch your sidearm with your AT so you can grab it quicker you run out of Ammo
[3:34:21] <Raztron> i should use the L-star again it was very fun
[3:34:33] <+gralho> i missed it
[3:34:37] <+gralho> ok
[3:34:41] <Raztron> its like a mass effect 1 gun
[3:35:00] <%AppleBasket> LStar is beautiful
[3:35:04] <Shufflemang> @megaminimechamocha To be fair, I'm sure most of the blame there can be laid on EA's terrible marketing for the game... that being mostly none.
[3:35:10] <%AppleBasket> but it is kinda different from all the other guns
[3:35:14] <+gralho> Do you like apples, chat?
[3:35:15] <bardicfire> L-Star is one of those guns that like you know it's not the best but you're still gonna use it because yay lazers
[3:35:16] <%AppleBasket> due to slow bullets and a heat mechanic
[3:35:21] <%yeknomlive> lstar reminds me of borderlands 2 maliwan guns
[3:35:22] <UnfilteredComic> I use L-Star for my Mid-Range build, fun stuff
[3:35:30] <megaminimechamocha> EA More like Erasing Art
[3:35:35] <haisho> Origiiiiin
[3:35:36] <%Jensegaense> Estimated Wait timeNEVER works
[3:35:41] <%Ion_LaserX> @Shufflemang which EA tends to do to games that are not Madden or FIFA
[3:35:49] <42nfl19> @WoolieVersus Also dont forget, just because someone does not have the sbf tag does not mean they arent a fan. They could be just macthing up with out joinging the network
[3:36:00] <sanctified_succ> yeah it does that
[3:36:01] <megaminimechamocha> EA more like Estimated Assblasting
[3:36:13] <@Menitta> No it means they're not fans. Smfh
[3:36:14] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I wish we were playing on PS4 because my mom says its my little brothers turn with the PC Kappa
[3:36:48] <+GreatestGuess> What kind of fake fan wouldn’t join the network? Kappa
[3:36:51] <bardicfire> BTW They aren't in your active Network, but they have the others
[3:36:57] <NoirePanzer> Probably best off doing a dead playlist
[3:36:59] <@Menitta> Anyone still using the Advocate group is not a fan
[3:37:03] <%Jensegaense> Open hunt on Woolie to get wrecked by Pros
[3:37:05] <%AppleBasket> do 1v1s Kappa
[3:37:07] <gryffinp> @WoolieVersus I kinda think that there just aren't a lot of the sbfp crew left, and we were all in this ctf that just ended
[3:37:10] <misteralex412> @WoolieVersus you could always pick Bounty Hunt as a compromise
[3:37:12] <Kain5707> cant you create a custom game thats open to the network?
[3:37:20] <bardicfire> essentially your active network is who it looks for first, and then anyone who also is part of the network but not active second.
[3:37:38] <%djinnJuice> @WoolieVersus I'm trying hard to get in but I'm also playing my real missions
[3:37:45] <+Ecchigun> runing games\
[3:37:46] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> thats my default network anyway
[3:37:47] <+Ecchigun> :(
[3:37:49] <FeedbacK7777> Hello, hello, how's the Woolieverse doing today?
[3:37:51] <+GreatestGuess> Wow, ruining the game NotLikeThis
[3:37:52] <%djinnJuice> like the ones I'm matching in to
[3:37:57] <@mothmandraws> thyhy get in there and carry

[3:38:09] <%djinnJuice> I said a dumb thing
[3:38:10] <+Ecchigun> kids game
[3:38:17] <Shufflemang> The way networks work in this game is kinda messy
[3:38:17] <JumboMan214> Hello everyone
[3:38:17] <@mothmandraws> wait I thought this was apex?
[3:38:20] <bardicfire> speaking of if anyone is playing on Xbox I'm in the SBFP Network right now
[3:38:22] <TheAmazingClaytor> That campaign is faaaaaantastic.
[3:38:35] <+Ecchigun> same but yeah
[3:38:42] <junks2300> Hello everybody
[3:38:44] <+Ecchigun> if i get in this network will be dead
[3:38:45] <Raztron> what
[3:38:47] <megaminimechamocha> Hey Woolie have you heard of this new game Apex Legends you should play that
[3:38:48] <Shufflemang> Titanfall 2 has the best modern military FPS campaign of all time.
[3:38:49] <+CreakySkelly> lol
[3:38:49] <Kain5707> @WoolieVersus i know its only 4 players but have you played frontline yet?
[3:38:52] <Doc2722> Grill Daddy!
[3:38:53] <@Menitta> Bounty Hunt sucks
[3:38:56] <Marhunter7> I just really wish they'd of kept regular hard point
[3:38:59] <%AppleBasket> does anyone know where to get a cheap copy of T2 for Origin?
[3:39:02] <@mothmandraws> its fine woolie will carry
[3:39:02] <+allups> bounty hunt is great
[3:39:04] <ktm2254> bounty hunt is super fun tho
[3:39:05] <+Ecchigun> hello hello
[3:39:07] <@mothmandraws> he needs the handicap
[3:39:11] <+Big__Bang__Blitz> played since release, no idea how to join the game
[3:39:12] <misteralex412> @AppleBasket check out G2A
[3:39:18] <+CreakySkelly> i agree, I think it's the worst game mode
[3:39:18] <%AppleBasket> thank you
[3:39:20] <Raztron> I love this intro
[3:39:21] <+Ecchigun> im watching O_O
[3:39:22] <gryffinp> Counterpoint: Bounty Hunt is good, Amped Hardpoint sucks.
[3:39:30] <+Ecchigun> but yeah i will buy titanfall 2
[3:39:33] <JumboMan214> Wish I had titanfall 2
[3:39:36] <+Ecchigun> looks like a great game
[3:39:41] <%AppleBasket> Bounty Hunt is fun
[3:39:43] <mayorrev> Isn't that just the Index from Warframe?
[3:39:44] <%AppleBasket> but punishing
[3:39:51] <+Yokuho> WHO SAID THAT
[3:39:55] <@mothmandraws> why dont we get the cool aesthetic maps in apex
[3:39:57] <bardicfire> War Games is best map hands down
[3:39:59] <%yuribo26> This map already looks better than anything any other modern fps has ever done
[3:40:00] <Shufflemang> Bounty Hunt seems a lot more decisive of a mode than I thought. But yeah, Amped Hardpoint sucks ass.
[3:40:00] <megaminimechamocha> In MGS5 they had an excellent Bounty Hunt mode where you could steal points from the other team yo
[3:40:01] <+FuhrerVonZephyr> I wanna try to get into one more game before Toonami tonight
[3:40:07] <megaminimechamocha> also WHO'S TALKING
[3:40:08] <+x24sonic> !uptime

[3:40:10] <jase__x> a very cool map
[3:40:15] <@mothmandraws> get that eva 8 back
[3:40:15] <Raztron> Yea regular bounty hun is a fun harder attrition mode
[3:40:16] <bardicfire> love those long corridors
[3:40:28] <JanusII> This would be the practice mode stage for the Titanfall fighting game.
[3:40:29] <Shufflemang> War Games is good shit no matter what entry it is TPFufun
[3:40:36] <Raztron> gotta rocket slide more bro
[3:40:41] <@mothmandraws> woolie you suck at tracking so get that eva 8, your first shots are often more accurate
[3:40:42] <+Ecchigun> ok this map is sick

[3:41:48] <bardicfire> @American_Saikyo almost every map is a simulation.

[3:41:56] <%ZombiLoin> not every
[3:42:00] <+Ecchigun> in apex , people stand no chance on my sniping
[3:42:01] <%ZombiLoin> i think only glitch and war games
[3:42:06] <Heavensguard92> The best map intro is still that drop pod one from tf1
[3:42:10] <+LogothX> Playing this game with a controller must be a herculean effort
[3:42:15] <+CezrDaPleazr> Hell yeah Titanfall 2
[3:42:16] <bardicfire> nah a lot of them have little spots where you can see thru the skybox
[3:42:17] <+Ecchigun> lets see if it applies to titan fall
[3:42:19] <%yuribo26> Man, Woolie's character is very Apex Legends
[3:42:24] <%lewdskeletor13> The only mech game I really care about atm is Metal Wolf Chaos
[3:42:30] <%lewdskeletor13> RICHAAAARD
[3:42:32] <Raztron> yea dude you get dropped of in a space ship and leave in the ship for every other map
[3:42:32] <gryffinp> Stream dead or me dead?
[3:42:40] <Kain5707> frame drops

[3:42:46] <%djinnJuice> it's struggling
[3:42:47] <Kain5707> huge drop
[3:42:48] <jase__x> oof the frames
[3:42:49] <AncelDeLambert> oh god the stream is destabilizing
[3:42:52] <%yuribo26> SAVED
[3:42:55] <%bindatil> It's back
[3:42:56] <+LogothX> L star can be hard to use
[3:42:56] <%AppleBasket> GIGA DRILL BREAK
[3:42:56] <bardicfire> @Ecchigun it's got some damn good snipers, but remember that this is a game that you do not stand still and camp in
[3:42:57] <%lewdskeletor13> woolieSMUG woolieSMUG woolieSMUG
[3:42:57] <greenhathero> wuh happen
[3:42:58] <jase__x> we good now
[3:42:59] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @WoolieVersus Why you so bad at shooters? You just gotta think of it like a fighting game, stop throwing Lights and Mediums because Heavys are the best
[3:43:03] <bardicfire> it's all about that movement
[3:43:05] <AncelDeLambert> my god you die fast in this game
[3:43:13] <jase__x> lol
[3:43:32] <+LogothX> @Breakfast_Megapowers He's playing on a controller, so it's basically like trying to play Guilty Gear on a DDR pad.
[3:43:34] <bardicfire> @AncelDeLambert time to kill is actually longer than most FPS
[3:43:38] <%Keyd00d> NotLikeThis
[3:43:39] <+Rayqauzay> well u got to move fast in the game
[3:43:40] <+Mr_FruitzNutz> woolie let me smell that titan deeeek, so i know no other pilot been in it
[3:43:41] <Raztron> not as fast as regular COD though
[3:43:49] <@mothmandraws> grab that shotgun woolie
[3:43:49] <Heavensguard92> Woolie with his whiffed kicks
[3:43:54] <+Ecchigun> @bardicfire wait until i hop in
[3:43:56] <railmee_hardurr> lead
[3:43:58] <+Ecchigun> i force people to not move
[3:43:58] <@mothmandraws> show him who is boss
[3:43:58] <+jorgamund> this is a weird looking Apex Legend mod
[3:44:02] <jase__x> whiffed
[3:44:04] <Raztron> i always whiff my melee hits
[3:44:05] <AncelDeLambert> I'm mostly comparing to Apex, where it feels I can unload for five seconds straight and not kill anything
[3:44:09] <$GoogleyGareth> Nice!
[3:44:10] <Raztron> im terrible at that
[3:44:14] <%lewdskeletor13> Ban him woolieSMUG
[3:44:19] <+FuhrerVonZephyr> YEAH AIRDROP KILL
[3:44:20] <Shufflemang> @anceldelambert TTK is longer, but there are a good amount of weapons that do insane amounts of damage. Also melee being busted.
[3:44:20] <haisho> NOICE
[3:44:23] <%AppleBasket> @WoolieVersus remember to spam your RIGHTBUMPER
[3:44:25] <jase__x> aNiiiice
[3:44:28] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @LogothX I mean if you only use Heavy's on the DDR Pad you will still win
[3:44:28] <JanusII> You have to lead target a bit with L-STAR.
[3:44:30] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> BRRRRT
[3:44:30] <%djinnJuice> now I'm gonna wait until this match is over so I can actually properly join
[3:44:52] <Shufflemang> Is the stream back up for anyone else?
[3:44:55] <RedoctoberWolf> I just woke up what is the procedure and how to join
[3:44:56] <TheAmazingClaytor> O O F
[3:45:04] <Josef_Stryker> RIP
[3:45:05] <bardicfire> I bet you Woolie isn't even using Bumper Jumper...
[3:45:06] <@mothmandraws> wow traitor skull
[3:45:10] <AncelDeLambert> ah, I see Woolie too is a connesoure of the vaunted "shoot their heels" technique
[3:45:14] <nathorz1> Get in the robot Woolie
[3:45:15] <%AppleBasket> @RedoctoberWolf you need to be in the network and get an invite from Skull
[3:45:18] <haisho> where's my spinny stick
[3:45:20] <%lewdskeletor13> woolieOMG woolieOMG woolieOMG TRAITOR

[3:45:27] <haisho> I need to go TRAITOR appropriately
[3:45:36] <AncelDeLambert> shoot that wall, Woolie, SHOOT IT
[3:45:39] <+LogothX> @Breakfast_Megapowers Pat plays on a wireless mouse on a felt couch and wonders why he can't aim w/ mouse anymore, screams about how he's old and then goes to play on PS4.
[3:45:47] <megaminimechamocha> TR8R is my favorite Star Wars character
[3:45:50] <Raztron> lol
[3:46:04] <%DarkwolfWeyr> I missed earlier, why was the custom game in network stuff not working?
[3:46:12] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @LogothX Because PS4 is the real PC
[3:46:26] <+mugwugsampoo> Kill Pog
[3:46:27] <@mothmandraws> they need to release PC 2 at some point
[3:46:28] <+LogothX> The true PC is the friends we made along the wayu
[3:46:31] <AncelDeLambert> Woolie's aim is as good as mine: terrible.
[3:46:32] <bardicfire> they misunderstood how networks work i think
[3:46:39] <TheAmazingClaytor> LUL
[3:46:39] <haisho> WE DID IT
[3:46:40] <$FuqBoiSlim> WOW

[3:50:11] <@Moobot> Easy with the emojis @Jeebus4
[3:50:11] <Raztron> I just get more ammo for the minigun and extra core
[3:50:13] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> What if BioWare made a Titanfall PCRPG
[3:50:14] <+Shampoohyay> the kit that makes you walk faster with your gun down is fun
[3:50:14] <Heavensguard92> if i ever use legion, i usually roll the extra ammo
[3:50:18] <+secretspud> Woolie, you just gotta use your kill streak things when you get them
[3:50:19] <+Shampoohyay> people don't expect you to shuffle at them that fast
[3:50:22] <+SpiritOki> Is he on PC?
[3:50:24] <+secretspud> toss out some turrets
[3:50:32] <%Jensegaense> @breakfast_megapowers you mean Anthem?

[3:50:37] <%Ion_LaserX> @SpiritOki yeah
[3:50:39] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> I'm gonna play with the Australians if there is any on?
[3:50:41] <artcellrox> i just joined in, is Woolie done with the campaign?
[3:50:46] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @Jensegaense no something good
[3:50:59] <IncredibleMeh> Woolie's been done with the campaign for ages
[3:51:02] <%djinnJuice> I'm in now so I'm good
[3:51:06] <ArchLightAce> I've been trying to get in
[3:51:07] <T4silly> @artcellrox He finished it years ago. Sk yes.
[3:51:09] <%Jensegaense> Then current BioWare is the wrong developer, friend...
[3:51:09] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I haven't been able to get in on PS4 Kappa
[3:51:10] <42nfl19> same!
[3:51:10] <%DarkwolfWeyr> have not been able to get in at all unfortunately
[3:51:15] <+Shampoohyay> leaving might not necessarily help considering no one can join without being friends with someone already in there :V
[3:51:15] <+HeySerg> I was just happy to play the game tonight
[3:51:19] <+FuhrerVonZephyr> Aww, didn't get in this time

[3:51:49] <+FuhrerVonZephyr> Yeah fair enough
[3:51:49] <bevyrage> @woolieversus have you been opening your advocate gifts? see that you have new messages and those could be that.
[3:51:50] <+zaworldo> uSING THE L-STAR?!?!?!
[3:51:54] <+Shampoohyay> you can cheat the first point by changing data center if you have to
[3:51:56] <Raztron> theres titans
[3:51:59] <Raztron> just no grunts
[3:52:01] <%Jensegaense> I’m happy that I was MVP in the one match that I got in with him
[3:52:06] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> fight me @mothmandraws
[3:52:14] <bursky00> How hard is Woolie getting bodied right now?
[3:52:21] <Heavensguard92> Oh shit I just remembered that grav stars can orbit l star shots
[3:52:23] <railmee_hardurr> attrition but no bots
[3:52:24] <@mothmandraws> you are too far away kai
[3:52:25] <KitkatRai> Woah what? They already have an Apex Legends ripoff? That's sad Keepo
[3:52:26] <+Nanocomputer> hes doing better
[3:52:31] <+GreatestGuess> Isn’t skirmish just no bots?
[3:52:33] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Woolie got some good hits in tho
[3:52:33] <Raztron> he has a controller for PC fps @bursky00
[3:52:34] <%AppleBasket> I don't mind the grunts
[3:52:39] <%AppleBasket> they're a fun way to build meter
[3:52:44] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus never go the full clip with the L-STAR, it's ammo regens
[3:52:46] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Woolie get caught in Frame Traps
[3:52:57] <+Grayhammatter> holy crap, forgot how fast this game was
[3:53:12] <bardicfire> its one of the Weekly game modes
[3:53:12] <+xS1D3SW1P3x> Using the L Star? A man of taste right there apatCrazyhand apatCanada
[3:53:13] <JanusII> The grunts are for the MOBA players.
[3:53:20] <Raztron> does not extend the amount of time you can shoot before overheat for the L-star?
[3:53:22] <bardicfire> @WoolieVersus its one of the Weekly Gamemodes
[3:53:23] <+Shampoohyay> the grunts are for woolie
[3:53:26] <mayorrev> le fortnite
[3:53:27] <Raztron> the extended clip
[3:53:30] <+Shampoohyay> it does, yes
[3:53:36] <+Grayhammatter> got got
[3:53:47] <+secretspud> Use that sentry Woolz
[3:53:47] <TheAmazingClaytor> get get get get got got got gto
[3:53:50] <Raztron> good thats what i was assuming
[3:54:03] <T4silly> Always go for the execution.
[3:54:04] <Shufflemang> There used to be a pretty fun FFA mode called Free Agents, but I don't know if that ever got put back into rotation.
[3:54:08] <%AppleBasket> extended clip is good for LStar, especially if the strat is to fire a LOT of bullets
[3:54:11] <+Shampoohyay> sadly quick reload only shortens the overheat reload, so it's kind of useless
[3:54:14] <Tucker0603> I personally like using the quick reload on my L-Star
[3:54:26] <+Shampoohyay> it's totally possible for it to reduce the cooldown after firing or accelerate the total cooldown but
[3:54:27] <+Detectivemac9> the strat is always fire a lot of bullets on the l-star
[3:54:29] <$Tuskor13> RKO outta nowhere
[3:54:30] <+Shampoohyay> it just doesn't because shrug
[3:54:36] <ArchLightAce> Woolie has improved a lot over the course of this stream
[3:54:51] <@mothmandraws> that beam dodge
[3:54:55] <@Menitta> My advice would be to kill everyone on the opposite team
[3:55:04] <bardicfire> every Auto Pistol user needs to delete the game.
[3:55:07] <+Shampoohyay> that was skull's nuke, you were safe :V
[3:55:08] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[3:55:10] <+Negativecosine> It seems like woolie doesnt look at his radar at all
[3:55:16] <ArchLightAce> deplete thier health before they deplete yours!
[3:55:18] <+Shampoohyay> i don't think he does, yeah
[3:55:18] <T4silly> It was a teammate, you would have lived.
[3:55:34] <+Shampoohyay> it's a habit you don't get used to when you don't play shooters, as is the case with woolie
[3:55:35] <Heavensguard92> man can only stare at so many parts of the screen
[3:55:36] <%AppleBasket> don't forget you have 2 powershots
[3:55:44] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> What day is for Woolie to be GOOD at video games? Kappa
[3:55:46] <+Shampoohyay> meanwhile being raised on cod and halo means staring at the minimap all game lol
[3:55:54] <+Shampoohyay> woolie! power shot!
[3:55:58] <+Shampoohyay> it's like 2300 damage instantly!
[3:56:03] <+Shampoohyay> not into the shield aaa
[3:56:07] <+Grayhammatter> oh crap
[3:56:11] <DSD24> Hi Woolie!
[3:56:15] <+Shampoohyay> that's definitely hackout on him with an epg
[3:56:20] <DSD24> Hello everyone
[3:56:25] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> heard, Crazy Talk
[3:56:40] <Tucker0603> hmm, maybe I should use the extend on my L-Star...
[3:56:53] <+Shampoohyay> it and tactikill are the only things really worth using on it
[3:56:58] <@Menitta> If you throw a firestar at a friendly, they carry it and start RAINING FIRE! Not optimal but fucking cool
[3:57:00] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> way to punch that nothing
[3:57:01] <Heavensguard92> that aim sensitivity
[3:57:02] <sidstyler> this game looks fun, why didn't it do well again?
[3:57:09] <+Shampoohyay> no reason to ads, no need for gunrunner if you're any good, and quick swap just isn't useful
[3:57:13] <%AppleBasket> 3v1 = Woolie killed a man
[3:57:15] <Tucker0603> I use gun runner too
[3:57:18] <%Ion_LaserX> @sidstyler lack of marketing by EA
[3:57:20] <@mothmandraws> bad release date
[3:57:22] <DSD24> Man Scorch was the best in this game
[3:57:22] <+Anime_SB> it was released at the same time as battlefield
[3:57:25] <artcellrox> @sidstyler bunch of factors involving marketing and release date in between BF1 and CoD
[3:57:25] <+Shampoohyay> because it has a skill ceiling in the heavens
[3:57:26] <%AppleBasket> gun runner is beautiful on LSTAR as well
[3:57:26] <+Irridium> @sidstyler ea released it right between battlefield and call of duty
[3:57:29] <Raztron> it was released between Battlefield 1 and somthing else cause of EA
[3:57:29] <+Grayhammatter> you thought, but he saw ya
[3:57:29] <+Shampoohyay> and is incredibly hard to get into
[3:57:30] <Raztron> YEA
[3:57:31] <%yeknomlive> was released very close to battlefield 4
[3:57:32] <%AppleBasket> but then gun runner is always good
[3:57:33] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Release time and advertising
[3:57:33] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> EA released Advanced Warfare around the same time?
[3:57:35] <Marhunter7> @sidstyler Because EA released it the within a week of both battlefield and Call of duty
[3:57:37] <+Shampoohyay> gun runner is never good
[3:57:41] <+Shampoohyay> gun runner is for groundlets
[3:57:43] <Doc2722> @Woolie try the grav star throwable helps with jumpers
[3:57:43] <+jorgamund> this is WEIRD... I just recognized that building from Apex Legends
[3:57:46] <@mothmandraws> I imagine everyone drops who they are killing to kill woolie
[3:57:47] <Tucker0603> got my L-Star to get 7
[3:57:52] <@mothmandraws> apex reuses alot of stuff
[3:58:02] <DSD24> @jorgamund The same devs made Titanfall 2 and Apex Legends
[3:58:03] <@mothmandraws> wish they re used the cool aesthetic maps
[3:58:13] <DSD24> Oh wow
[3:58:13] <+Grayhammatter> oof
[3:58:14] <+alcoholoch> rip
[3:58:14] <@Menitta> Note, Respawn chose to go up against COD. EA chose the date for BF1
[3:58:15] <+Shampoohyay> apex's asset reuse is mostly environmental, animations, and sounds
[3:58:16] <%QueequegTheater> LUL
[3:58:17] <keiji_maede> Damn~
[3:58:19] <ghostravens> fucking MORTIS
[3:58:19] <T4silly> Gun runner us really good...
[3:58:19] <%Ion_LaserX> woolieYE
[3:58:19] <+LumberjackJack> YEE YEE YEE
[3:58:20] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Oh boy
[3:58:21] <$FuqBoiSlim> EXPOSED
[3:58:22] <Raztron> yea it looks so lifeless in Apex
[3:58:27] <Heavensguard92> That Zombie with the inner pieces
[3:58:29] <+jorgamund> yeah I know, I mean I just switched over to the tab after not watching for a while, and for like 3 seconds thought Woolie switched games
[3:58:29] <+Shampoohyay> and the animations and sounds have just always been consistent in titanfall
[3:58:36] <jase__x> ended you as if he was Raiden
[3:58:39] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Who knows? maybe Titanfall 2 Maps may be integrated into Apex somehow
[3:58:47] <+Shampoohyay> i'd count on it
[3:58:53] <+Shampoohyay> that seems to be the idea already
[3:58:56] <bardicfire> my only complain about this game is the lack of other language packs for the titans
[3:59:00] <Pandapanda92> looks like a bootleg Apex.
[3:59:04] <bardicfire> I loved my Japanese Titan OS
[3:59:04] <Raztron> same bardic
[3:59:05] <@Menitta> If the TF2 maps are gonna be in Apex, they should all be one map
[3:59:12] <Heavensguard92> apex already has a few areas straight from tf2
[3:59:22] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I can't believe Titanfall ripped off Apex Legends
[3:59:24] <%QueequegTheater> Man, RE2's third act really goes places, huh
[3:59:26] <+jorgamund> the devs already said they're committed to the single Apex map for now
[3:59:28] <megaminimechamocha> Is it really out of the question to hope Apex's success might possibly give us a Titanfall 3 one day?
[3:59:29] <+Shampoohyay> apex uses various environment bits and map structure from both titanfalls
[3:59:31] <TheAmazingClaytor> 2fort?
[3:59:41] <%Ion_LaserX> @jorgamund maybe
[3:59:47] <+Shampoohyay> most of the actual assets are remastered though
[3:59:48] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> friggin Apex Clone
[3:59:50] <+WhatTheFlox> FortOne
[3:59:50] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 4 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 16oz (480mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[3:59:51] <Raztron> titanfall 3 development was dropped for apex for 2019
[4:00:03] <@Menitta> One off
[4:00:03] <artcellrox> my region is currently in asia in titanfall 2 pc, will i not be able to join the network?
[4:00:04] <+Ecchigun> TEH CHOE
[4:00:06] <%Keyd00d> wow
[4:00:06] <+Ecchigun> THE CHOKE
[4:00:08] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @Stay_Hydrated_Bot How much alchhol though?
[4:00:09] <+Grayhammatter> that's a bummer
[4:00:10] <Raztron> but they announced some titanfall spin off for this year or next
[4:00:13] <Graywolf_the_45th> ouch
[4:00:13] <wolvenelf> damn
[4:00:19] <+Shampoohyay> ie the shacks from titanfall 1's lagoon are much more detailed in apex and so on
[4:00:38] <$FuqBoiSlim> LEEEEEEEON PLEASE SHE HAS 5 CATS
[4:00:39] <+frugglemeister> BORN TO DIE
[4:00:42] <@mothmandraws> titan body blck
[4:00:43] <SaltyDongs> Leon please
[4:00:44] <@mothmandraws> block
[4:00:44] <+Grayhammatter> run woolie run!
[4:00:45] <T4silly> Sounding like RE4 right now.
[4:00:48] <+Shampoohyay> how could you treat legion like this
[4:00:50] <42nfl19> That was a close match
[4:00:51] <haisho> tfw Woolie betrays Legion and uses him as bait
[4:00:52] <+LumberjackJack> Legion! BibleThump
[4:00:56] <+Shampoohyay> wrong way lol
[4:01:02] <+Anime_SB> @WoolieVersus you can try and cheese drop on them after stealing a battery
[4:01:05] <+Shampoohyay> ship destroyed anyways, rip
[4:01:07] <%ImperiusMex> Its okay woolie
[4:01:10] <bardicfire> OMG Woolie is using Default controls
[4:01:10] <%ImperiusMex> i was at the bottom
[4:01:11] <wolvenelf> lol
[4:01:13] <%Sxy_T_Rex> Just let me play as Blisk daddy in Apex
[4:01:15] <42nfl19> I was in the middle
[4:01:19] <%ThePaleSage> Rip
[4:01:19] <+Shampoohyay> yeah, if he'd learn bumper jumper he'd do a lot better
[4:01:20] <+TheLordOfHats> Hey @woolieversus do you think you'll ever do Tablelords again?
[4:01:21] <42nfl19> AVERAGE
[4:01:21] <+Ecchigun> lol mex
[4:01:21] <bardicfire> @WoolieVersus use Bumper Jumper it will change your life
[4:01:23] <@mothmandraws> not bottom
[4:01:24] <+Ecchigun> 15 deaths
[4:01:29] <%AppleBasket> Woolie, you have Jump bound to L1 right?
[4:01:29] <sidstyler> oh hey it's like one of my KDAs
[4:01:33] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> ORIGIN sux
[4:01:42] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Hashire!
[4:01:55] <Shufflemang> @bardicfire I dunno, Woolie doesn't know how to slidehop yet.
[4:01:55] <@Menitta> Angel City?
[4:02:00] <42nfl19> That indoor mall map?
[4:02:05] <+FakerAbsin> I got my one private match in. I'm happy. Ggs woolie
[4:02:14] <+LumberjackJack> Complex?
[4:02:14] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:02:16] <bardicfire> Slidehopping is a bit hard on controller but Bumper Jumper is essential
[4:02:18] <$TRILLTURBAN> Woolie run the gauntlet until you get the world record live on stream
[4:02:27] <bardicfire> @WoolieVersus use Bumper Jumper
[4:02:27] <+mechslayer71> Just bought the game. Are there really strong pistols in here, chat? My fave type of weapon
[4:02:34] <+Shampoohyay> 5 on 5, just what you wanted, nice
[4:02:36] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> LUL
[4:02:39] <Shufflemang> @bardicfire I prefer Ninja, but to each their own.
[4:02:40] <+Shampoohyay> make it a nice one
[4:02:45] <+Shampoohyay> oh man township AHP
[4:02:45] <@mothmandraws> woolie finish this with a 1v1 against skull
[4:02:47] <Raztron> Wingman mechslayer
[4:02:47] <+Shampoohyay> good shit
[4:02:49] <@mothmandraws> eva 8 only
[4:02:52] <+CreakySkelly> lol
[4:02:57] <+Shampoohyay> >no i don't wanna play better
[4:02:57] <+CreakySkelly> damn just like that
[4:02:58] <+Shampoohyay> ok
[4:03:02] <castcode> was that a little bit of Wakka
[4:03:03] <@Menitta> I also dont like Bumper Jumper
[4:03:05] <castcode> that I just heard
[4:03:07] <+Shampoohyay> i dunno man! you didn't wanna use the EVA!
[4:03:07] <TheAmazingClaytor> "Ideal solution, nyaa~~?" - WoolieWoolz
[4:03:12] <$TRILLTURBAN> @mechslayer71 personally I really like P2016 for a good magdump, but the revolvers aren't too bad
[4:03:13] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Show off all them shooter skillz @WoolieVersus
[4:03:14] <42nfl19> Since this is the last one you'll be top frag right?
[4:03:14] <+CreakySkelly> Bumper Jumper in Apex is the best
[4:03:16] <Shufflemang> Township is neat.
[4:03:19] <DSD24> I always liked Vynson Dynamics
[4:03:22] <%AppleBasket> being able to turn your camera and jump at the same time is nice
[4:03:25] <+Shampoohyay> an actual single game of live fire would be cool
[4:03:30] <bardicfire> Bumper Jumper utterly changes the game.
[4:03:30] <+Shampoohyay> it's a silly mode
[4:03:32] <+mechslayer71> @raztron Okay, I didn’t know whether or not that was also in this game, thanks
[4:03:33] <DSD24> I always thought Ash was really cool
[4:03:34] <+xS1D3SW1P3x> Just plug in a controller with paddles
[4:03:36] <Shufflemang> @dsd24 YES, I'M NOT ALONE
[4:03:46] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Hey woolie, what kina runs do you do?
[4:03:50] <%plebianpatrician> why did i stop playing this game??? reinstalling it right the fuck now
[4:03:53] <@mothmandraws> pogchamp
[4:03:55] <TheAmazingClaytor> Ooooh Killem
[4:03:56] <+Ecchigun> LETS GO
[4:03:57] <+Shampoohyay> skull going for the execution lmao
[4:03:58] <@mothmandraws> 3 kills including skull
[4:03:59] <+Ecchigun> NOOOOOOOOo
[4:04:01] <+Grayhammatter> rekt
[4:04:05] <%AppleBasket> LSTAR GOD
[4:04:06] <Raztron> Ash is the best waifu
[4:04:06] <+Irridium> PogChamp
[4:04:08] <+LumberjackJack> Lul
[4:04:08] <haisho> oh hey that actually went really good
[4:04:08] <%blazymaniac> does anyone know how to set guilty gear revelator to english? i have seen the game use english on youtube, but dont see a setting for it in the menus. bought the game on ps4 digital.
[4:04:09] <bardicfire> Damn
[4:04:10] <DSD24> @Shufflemang They were the only faction that I really liked plus Ash has the best quips
[4:04:11] <%AppleBasket> Woolie can't be contained
[4:04:14] <loli_gagging_> What is this plebian gameplay?????
[4:04:16] <42nfl19> wait @Shampoohyay ? The same guy who made the Jap mod?
[4:04:17] <keiji_maede> DEAT
[4:04:18] <vierleger> And remember, all those men just got beasted on by a pad warrior on PC
[4:04:28] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Woolie is going mad, like when he killed that guy
[4:04:32] <DSD24> @Shufflemang "That Pilot is of no threat to you"
[4:04:38] <+Grayhammatter> yikes
[4:05:01] <bardicfire> @Shufflemang yessss Ash is robot waifu
[4:05:12] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Woolie, not on stream, please
[4:05:29] <DSD24> Ash had that cool Titan as well
[4:05:39] <$TRILLTURBAN> Oh look it's an A wall
[4:05:50] <bardicfire> Focus. Fight. Win. is my mantra for this game
[4:05:50] <%djinnJuice> boy playing this game makes me lament that apex plays nothing like it
[4:06:02] <Raztron> same djinn
[4:06:09] <Raztron> all those shiny high walls in apex
[4:06:12] <bardicfire> especially with her cool synth voice.
[4:06:15] <HyperionXV> Hello folks. VoHiYo raysH rpdH
[4:06:17] <%djinnJuice> like slidehops and wallruns are just
[4:06:19] <%djinnJuice> oof
[4:06:21] <DSD24> @HyperionXV Hello!
[4:06:21] <%djinnJuice> I miss them
[4:06:26] <Shufflemang> The porcelain mask she wears with the hood is quite nice.
[4:06:26] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[4:06:33] <megaminimechamocha> classic woolie
[4:06:34] <Heavensguard92> LUL
[4:06:39] <Knife_28> Ash is best botfu
[4:06:40] <stiingraay> @djinnJuice you and me both
[4:06:42] <stiingraay> mioCRY
[4:06:43] <@mothmandraws> no we need to convince woolie he in 5v5 so he plays better
[4:06:48] <+Grayhammatter> a titanfall BR would be really cool
[4:06:57] <%djinnJuice> I've had more fun with the past hour or two of titanfall than I have with the entirety of the time I've played apex
[4:06:58] <$cureneckbeard> real
[4:07:01] <$TRILLTURBAN> No woolie it's a 1v1 ur doing great
[4:07:15] <dan_g_v> hey chat peoples, how is it going?
[4:07:17] <artcellrox> i'm still just glad that apex is fun on its own too
[4:07:21] <stiingraay> slidehopping would present a problem with the ring, you could probably outpace it
[4:07:28] <megaminimechamocha> @dan_g_v my dog died
[4:07:33] <bardicfire> so fun fact for chat: the robot pilots are NOT robots, they are in fact human pilots whose bodies weren't salvagable so they were uploaded to robot bodies. they are called Simulacrums
[4:07:39] <axivate_> LUL
[4:07:49] <dan_g_v> that's quite a shame, @megaminimechamocha but did your dog manage to make a titan fall at least?
[4:07:58] <DSD24> @bardicfire Oh wow I didn't know that
[4:08:03] <megaminimechamocha> @dan_g_v nah he was a fucking scrub
[4:08:04] <+mechslayer71> I’m in the MP lobby right now looking at the guns, they literally just renamed a bunch of them in Apex LUL
[4:08:09] <Shufflemang> @blazymaniac Huh, that explains a couple things.
[4:08:13] <dan_g_v> was afraid of that!
[4:08:14] <@Menitta> Aahhhh SMR woolieGASM
[4:08:17] <@mothmandraws> fun fact chat, skullgod actually views the universe at 0.5x the speed of the average person
[4:08:19] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> aSMR
[4:08:26] <Palmtuna> Some of them aren't even renamed
[4:08:31] <RubyPilot> @mechslayer71 apex takes place years after titanfall, so many of the guns in apex are descendants of titanfall guns
[4:08:33] <+Ecchigun> naked snake in robots
[4:08:34] <RubyPilot> see double take becoming triple take
[4:08:36] <+Ecchigun> genes
[4:08:45] <dan_g_v> superior genes?
[4:08:47] <RubyPilot> r201 becoming r301
[4:08:51] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> The SMR is so dumb i love it
[4:09:00] <bardicfire> @RubyPilot I was about to say, renames or just new models.
[4:09:03] <@mothmandraws> so close
[4:09:07] <@mothmandraws> you nearly baited him
[4:09:10] <RubyPilot> theyre new models
[4:09:11] <megaminimechamocha> Shoot at his feet, Woolie, that'll stop him!
[4:09:12] <Heavensguard92> SMR is so great
[4:09:19] <RubyPilot> triple take is a triple barrel rifle as opposed to the double take

[4:10:39] <@mothmandraws> you were like 1 bullet off
[4:10:41] <+Thraximunday> L Star requires a lot of leading your fire
[4:10:45] <+Thraximunday> Since it's projecticle
[4:10:45] <bardicfire> @Heavensguard92 the best part about the Sidewinder is it wasnt even an anti-titan in TF1, just a big fucking SMG.
[4:10:46] <+Spireman> Is today the day
[4:10:49] <megaminimechamocha> !motivated
[4:10:56] <+Spireman> !uptime

[4:10:59] <+Grayhammatter> wow,that gun though
[4:11:05] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @Spireman 4 wat
[4:11:08] <+Thraximunday> You gotta predict the opponent movement which is actually pretty hard
[4:11:23] <+Spireman> @breakfast_megapowers that everyone plays tf2
[4:11:24] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> last match BTW
[4:11:32] <bardicfire> yeah L-STAR is like the worst gun for Woolie. its all about tracking
[4:11:32] <BigNerdSam> What is this map?/?
[4:11:33] <+Shampoohyay> i'll be honest, leading the l-star is really easy because its projectiles are the size of beachballs
[4:11:40] <+Shampoohyay> it's a live fire map
[4:11:40] <%AppleBasket> FireStar kill!
[4:11:47] <DSD24> L Star looks so cool
[4:11:51] <+TechGamer> OMG your doing it!!
[4:11:57] <TheAmazingClaytor> Nice shootin', Tex.
[4:11:59] <hatesdps> you amazing dude. if i didnt have a full ps4 i would reinstall it right now
[4:12:05] <Heavensguard92> Bring woolie back to the scrublord
[4:12:10] <+DoStuffWithUs> what game is this>
[4:12:12] <+DoStuffWithUs> ?
[4:12:13] <+Shampoohyay> oh, lol, hackout broke out a cold war on a live fire map
[4:12:15] <+Shampoohyay> that's dirty
[4:12:17] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Apex Legends
[4:12:19] <%ZombiLoin> its an apex mod
[4:12:20] <Jaysky> Tittyfall 2 DoStuffWithUs
[4:12:23] <+Grayhammatter> well, this is PC
[4:12:23] <DSD24> @DoStuffWithUs This is Titanfall 2!

[4:12:30] <%AppleBasket> APEX dlc
[4:12:40] <+Shampoohyay> oh man, i forgot the final minute song still triggers on live fire maps
[4:12:42] <%ZombiLoin> tbf, hackout has been using a lot of the cold war
[4:12:42] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> APEX clone game
[4:12:43] <%djinnJuice> I'm sad I only got to do woolie dirty with the epg once
[4:12:44] <+Shampoohyay> love that fucking percussion
[4:12:45] <%ZombiLoin> i think he used it last game too
[4:12:50] <%djinnJuice> all my other kills on him were titan kills
[4:12:58] <%djinnJuice> and the epg kill was sloppy as fuck
[4:13:00] <+DoStuffWithUs> ohhhh ok looks like apex borrowed some ideas lol
[4:13:16] <bardicfire> @djinnJuice get a clip at least?
[4:13:22] <+Shampoohyay> man, i like the apex themes, but i miss some of the later titanfall 2 music like this track
[4:13:22] <%djinnJuice> I'll dig em up probalby
[4:13:23] <+DoStuffWithUs> Team Deathmatch?
[4:13:25] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Titanfall is the APEX Killer

[4:19:42] <RedoctoberWolf> just metal gear solid 4 ing it
[4:19:48] <%Sxy_T_Rex> i was pathfinder so technically shirtless
[4:19:49] <@mothmandraws> win with a mozambique
[4:19:54] <+Grayhammatter> millenium tower'd it
[4:19:55] <+cvp5127> was their a parry?
[4:20:02] <+Ecchigun> mozambique YO
[4:20:03] <%AppleBasket> mozambique only 1 person team game
[4:20:03] <@mothmandraws> achievement for carrying 2 mozambiques all game no other gun
[4:20:07] <Josef_Stryker> @WoolieVersus Just curious, have u won any Apex matches? If so how many?
[4:20:10] <%djinnJuice> I'm sad wools didn't try the titanfall mozamb, it's stupid strong
[4:20:12] <bardicfire> Mozambique is a thing
[4:20:20] <BallinArbiter> Did you go even further beyond?
[4:20:24] <bardicfire> Mozambique Challenge is a thing I mean
[4:20:31] <%Zebroneath> Dual Mozambiques
[4:20:33] <+Draegen86> Mozambusted
[4:20:33] <bardicfire> Get 5 kills with the Moz
[4:20:34] <+goose_attack_almanac> When in doubt
[4:20:34] <%djinnJuice> I made a huge mistake with using the apex mosamb like the titanfall 2 mosamb
[4:20:40] <%djinnJuice> it got me killed immediately
[4:20:42] <@mothmandraws> I hope april fools is "mozambique only mode"
[4:20:43] <Shufflemang> John Woo-themed achievements would be pretty neato
[4:20:43] <TheAmazingClaytor> "Mozam-Peaked" Unlocked!
[4:20:43] <%djinnJuice> cause that thing is dogshit

[4:20:52] <Josef_Stryker> You should get a Gold Trophy for winning a game with the Mozambique
[4:20:55] <megaminimechamocha> Did you punch them off the roof into the circle?
[4:20:55] <+Ecchigun> and il just sit here with my sniper
[4:20:56] <%AppleBasket> imagine if the Mozambique killed in 1 hit like T2

[4:22:18] <+Ecchigun> titanfall is melee

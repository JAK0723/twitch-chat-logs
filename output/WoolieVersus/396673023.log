[0:04:21] <%CaptainPileDriver> so, mk11 feels weird
[0:04:23] <%ThePaleSage> @menitta yep, it’s a good one
[0:04:24] <pillowwasp> True
[0:04:24] <simifu> Get ready guys, woolie is going to spend 2 hours in the mech customization Kappa
[0:04:36] <Thalchampz> he better do that

[0:04:43] <FuriousCabinBoy> How does mk11 feel?
[0:04:45] <Flunkorg> Also, lets be real. Armored core is a dead franchise.
[0:04:52] <pillowwasp> I think it needs a target camera lock feature

[0:06:04] <+DynDimAcsiwn> this tune selection fucking slaps
[0:06:06] <simifu> What I sent in my survey for this game: Better frame rate and more hair customization. Unless thats just for the demo.
[0:06:18] <+DynDimAcsiwn> can we just have the woolie playlist on?
[0:06:22] <Finaldragoon> is that what the kids are calling the Danganronpa?

[0:06:48] <OneEyeAnimator> <3 <3 <3 <3
[0:06:50] <ConLin_Arts_> I havent tried this myself but the character upgrading seems super neat with how it augments your character
[0:06:55] <Flunkorg> @simifu I put in better damage impact. Sometimes its hard to tell ifn your weapons are hitting because the game dioesn't give you much feedback

[0:17:10] <@Menitta> Just to disgust twitter
[0:17:13] <Angry_Ev1L> Will you stream different difficulties and Bloody Palace?
[0:17:14] <ConLin_Arts_> @UrsulaCat she's Bi???? Neato!
[0:17:16] <$eldritchhorrortwitchchat> Sekiro is harder to avoid spoilers for.
[0:17:18] <@akuda_bar> @Menitta you succeeded
[0:17:20] <dbgt5551> Well thats hype culture
[0:17:23] <pillowwasp> Dante gets the Satsui no Hado

[0:17:40] <+griffball13> @WoolieVersus you can do it woolie royal guard them spoilers
[0:17:44] <+primax104> Different camera angle!
[0:17:47] <Goraka91> Oh you listened to Devil Trigger a couple months ago? Here have an ending thumbnail! NotLikeThis
[0:17:54] <Yaya_> Reminds me of Persona 5 where you would be getting spoilers from recommended videos because you had watched stuff about past Persona games
[0:17:58] <mrpandabear437> yea the subreddit is gone
[0:18:03] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus did you manage to get a deluxe edition preorder too? Because those bonus costumes likely aren't going to be open to all
[0:18:07] <Jashter18> yes absolutely
[0:18:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> abandon the internet wollie
[0:18:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> *woolie
[0:18:15] <+TQuick101> the subreddit became r/devilmaycry
[0:18:22] <ConLin_Arts_> I have now noticed, is W101 just Platinum The Game? like everything in it is pure Platinum
[0:18:28] <+Zereaux> hey woolie any interest in love death and robots?
[0:18:30] <$Superdandy96> Oh god yes, the subreddit is FILLED with spoilers. PJSalt
[0:18:33] <%Solidnick18> yeah
[0:18:34] <+primax104> how far are you in Woolz?
[0:18:40] <Yaya_> W101 is if Platinum made Pikmin
[0:18:41] <+Afrobrawler> Yea, had to use a couple of site blockers
[0:18:45] <%Dungeon00X> I have the Deluxe edition.
[0:18:46] <uberhox> did u mute words on twitter
[0:18:48] <%UrsulaCat> Don’t worry Woolie I don’t know nothing about dmc you can talk to me
[0:18:49] <KeroKamina> FINALLY daemon X machina
[0:18:50] <kohreikestre> woolie i'm loving the W101 LP
[0:18:50] <TheAzureOracle> There's an upgrade yes
[0:18:59] <+TQuick101> upgrade is $15
[0:19:03] <$eldritchhorrortwitchchat> A image on the ps store spoiled a small part of sekiro for me but it's cool I'm more interested in it.
[0:19:04] <arkv01> finally, some good fuckin robots
[0:19:08] <xeros720> SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
[0:19:14] <NecDW4> Awwww man, time for some Not Armored Core!
[0:19:18] <jolt05> I believe Platinum is just the canon W101 telling some weird stuff they've seem
[0:19:18] <@Menitta> The cutscenes make it really worth it for me
[0:19:23] <xeros720> just throwing money at Itsuno
[0:19:23] <Yaya_> @WoolieVersus From the first missions that you've played so far, has it EXCEEDED ALL YOUR EXPECTATIONS
[0:19:27] <@Solidus_113> but the costumes like tan trish and white coat Nero are currently Preorder only, it's a bummer
[0:19:34] <TheAzureOracle> The live action cutscenes are great
[0:19:37] <@Solidus_113> so they're just gone
[0:19:41] <%Solidnick18> i don't know when they end
[0:19:41] <$Superdandy96> Hey Woolie, I really enjoyed yours and Reggie’s playthough of JSR, hope you guys enjoy JSR:future!
[0:19:44] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus Remember to give pat shit for not S ranking the dante stages and not never trying one of the devil arms
[0:19:45] <@Menitta> Thats not true, Solidus
[0:19:46] <vVAstrAVv> i like this preamble lol
[0:19:47] <simifu> For the survey i think
[0:19:51] <%UrsulaCat> Preamble all over me Woolie
[0:19:51] <Flunkorg> @WoolieVersus Theirs a time limit to download it but AFAIK it will always work.
[0:19:54] <@Menitta> I bought the upgrade after and have them
[0:19:54] <ConLin_Arts_> yeah when's Future???
[0:20:03] <Finaldragoon> @WoolieVersus the demo was pulled from the eShop, if you downloaded it, you can keep it forever
[0:20:06] <Cata_2136> Hey Woolie thanks for inspiring me to buy fightsticks for me and all my bros, was completely surprised by how nice they are
[0:20:10] <%Solidnick18> oh yeah
[0:20:12] <prime_name> Woolie, don't stare at me like that.
[0:20:16] <NecDW4> @WoolieVersus Rabi Ribi 4 lyfe!
[0:20:17] <+Eddy21forsaken> i forgot about that
[0:20:17] <DatAsuna> I am
[0:20:20] <$eldritchhorrortwitchchat> They can sell em for dlc down the line hell they might for dmc5
[0:20:23] <+primax104> MGS 3 LP?
[0:20:27] <sanctified_succ> :(
[0:20:31] <TheAzureOracle> Yeah the demo's gone already but if you have it you can still play it
[0:20:37] <ConLin_Arts_> that sounds neato!
[0:20:45] <seylumiue> Sounds good
[0:20:45] <%TheOneUpWarrior> of some goofy low budget student fipms
[0:20:46] <%UrsulaCat> @wooliewoolz don’t look me in the eyes like that
[0:20:50] <gameaholic42> Yeah that's fine. Just do it good xD
[0:20:56] <%UrsulaCat> Fuck wrong name
[0:21:02] <%UrsulaCat> Fuck fuck fuck
[0:21:04] <Kalz0ne> how much of the stream did I miss
[0:21:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> that's fine
[0:21:06] <vVAstrAVv> you gonna do sekiro man?
[0:21:10] <ConLin_Arts_> just re-enact it with some figurines you have!
[0:21:12] <Goraka91> That's like me with movies
[0:21:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> apatHoldon
[0:21:16] <%DoJoTron> To much good stuff out
[0:21:18] <%UrsulaCat> I’m shit
[0:21:25] <+primax104> is Sekiro character action?
[0:21:33] <+TQuick101> it's a souls game
[0:21:46] <$Superdandy96> Kinda like Max’s situation: too many games, not enough time
[0:21:53] <Strange_Journey31> What do you think of the new Jojo ending?
[0:21:58] <ConLin_Arts_> If it get's too hectic, remember to take some time off recording stuff and taking it easy!
[0:21:59] <LustrousEudemon> just stream your life 24/7 even when you go to the bathroom
[0:22:15] <+griffball13> @WoolieVersus they are hit or miss
[0:22:21] <+tygermom> have you managed to avoid DMC spoilers if so godpseed
[0:22:22] <DracaenaLeaf> which 2?
[0:22:32] <+DeadpanSoupcan> too long and I rather play it myself
[0:22:33] <xeros720> you really need someone that has played the game before to really keep it going smoothly
[0:22:34] <+primax104> it doesn't help that the game looks very old, in my opinion
[0:22:35] <Ryong> Hey Woolie hey chat
[0:22:35] <crimsonharvest> Earthbound is a tricky one because the fun part is reading all the silly dialog from everyone, and the goofy art, but the fighting is not it.
[0:22:50] <dbgt5551> It has to be the right ones. Alot of jrpgs can be really comfy or a clusterfuck to watch
[0:22:51] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[0:22:54] <%UrsulaCat> I remember when there was ONE Two Best Friends Play video per week @woolieversus feel free to take your time
[0:22:58] <@akuda_bar> you forget how much downtime is there
[0:23:01] <%CaptainPileDriver> you mean every pokemon game
[0:23:01] <DatAsuna> JRPGs should be streams not LPs yeah
[0:23:06] <CptBritches> Vinny Vinesauce streamed both Earthbound and Mother 3 and those were hugely successful playthroughs for him.
[0:23:09] <$Superdandy96> I’m super excited for that Earthbound LP. Mainly just for your reactions to stuff. But boy howdy does it suffer from 90s JRPG mechanics.
[0:23:15] <pillowwasp> Moving colors and shapes are important
[0:23:23] <xeros720> jrpgs work as stream, but episodic is real rough
[0:23:24] <ConLin_Arts_> Jooooooooojo
[0:23:25] <vVAstrAVv> just play ffx2 :p
[0:23:32] <crimsonharvest> yeah take a look at vinny's maybe, for the mother games. i'm not sure how he did it but there it is
[0:23:36] <AmericanaRed> Just play omikron 2nd gig
[0:23:38] <ConLin_Arts_> Play FF13 Kappa
[0:23:41] <%UrsulaCat> Play kingdom hearts they said
[0:23:42] <Ryong> I feel like JRPGs still need to be a bit more action-y to work
[0:23:52] <xeros720> the kingdom hearts curse is way too hreal
[0:23:57] <crimsonharvest> @Ryong how about like those Shadow Hearts games on ps2?
[0:23:58] <Ryong> @ConLin_Arts_ hey lightning returns would actually work, but 13 fuck no
[0:23:59] <Strange_Journey31> Like kingdom Hearts?
[0:24:03] <%CaptainPileDriver> TRAITOR'S REQUIEM
[0:24:10] <MForan98> absolutely
[0:24:11] <+Eddy21forsaken> "its just like pokemon" *remembers nuzelocke lp*
[0:24:22] <+griffball13> @WoolieVersus You king crimson the boring parts of jrpgs
[0:24:23] <Ryong> @crimsonharvest I think it'd be sort of like the FFX LP so...not that great
[0:24:25] <AutechreTwinAphex> there's a lot of grinding in a Souls game too though; having to grind for blood vials in Bloodborne after losing to a boss
[0:24:26] <ConLin_Arts_> I actually like 13, but 13-2 was leagues better, never played LR
[0:24:28] <+segatas> Daemon X Machina demo is really fun if you like Armored Core with DMC music
[0:24:30] <Xeno351> yeah, i just got octopath and because there are no highlight's it fucking sucks
[0:24:30] <seylumiue> Oof nuzlocke
[0:24:33] <arkv01> yeyeye love you and reggie!
[0:24:34] <%UrsulaCat> Nuzlocke lp was good fuck you griffball
[0:24:35] <%robobeau> Someone needs to make an RPG with a fighting game engine for the random battles
[0:24:36] <@mothmandraws> is this stream DMC?
[0:24:37] <Rawpost> yeah, I had to keep a wiki open to maximize grinding
[0:24:40] <Ryong> @ConLin_Arts_ LR is completely different and fucking great
[0:24:47] <Ryong> @robobeau something something tales games
[0:24:48] <crimsonharvest> @Ryong I LIked that one but not cause the game was awesome lol
[0:24:49] <ConLin_Arts_> KH streams with Punch mom!!
[0:24:50] <Strange_Journey31> Its okay
[0:24:53] <prime_name> It's cool to vent when you need to.
[0:24:55] <dbgt5551> Gotta let it Gotta let it out
[0:24:56] <vVAstrAVv> play the witcher 3. going on easy mode can skirt the level grind a fair bit
[0:24:57] <%UrsulaCat> Ultra despair girls was the actual bad lp
[0:24:57] <+sentaiStriker> that's fine, I enjoy hearing you talk
[0:24:58] <@Solidus_113> I crave new one-off videos
[0:24:59] <@mothmandraws> its fine you had no podcast to vent so chat
[0:25:00] <+DeathByAttempt> I think that Shut Up and Jam Gaiden is a great sort of JRPG to LP and stream because it has so many things going on so fast, it doesn't bog down.
[0:25:02] <Jetto_kazama> @robobeau I second this
[0:25:03] <+mcjimbo12> Pat's pre-stream literally takes like 90 minutes dude, you're good
[0:25:04] <Luvinsus> Don't worry, we watch Pat, we're used to it
[0:25:07] <+primax104> woolie is taking a page out of Pat's book XD
[0:25:14] <vVAstrAVv> ^
[0:25:15] <Ryong> hey woolie how far did you get into monster hunter?
[0:25:15] <%UrsulaCat> Woolie never shut up please
[0:25:16] <$cureneckbeard> best fr-ended
[0:25:17] <+griffball13> rip sonic unleashed
[0:25:23] <@Menitta> i love that about yall
[0:25:23] <%robobeau> @ryong I'm talking a Street Fighter fight as a random encounter, but yeah
[0:25:26] <simifu> and kingdom hearts
[0:25:28] <Laironx3> I agree with the chat, streaming jrpgs would be a good fit
[0:25:33] <Kalz0ne> more jrpgs need like bravely default where you can adjust the enemy encounter rate
[0:25:34] <ConLin_Arts_> Pats streams have like Podcasts before the game starts, its amazing
[0:25:36] <xeros720> woolie figuring it out, in real time
[0:25:40] <fairore> yo woolie
[0:25:41] <%UrsulaCat> WOOLIE IS GOODIE
[0:25:43] <+buttdirt> @mcjimbo12 not only that, but because of all the red balls he drinks, he's sick half of the year and misses half of his streams
[0:25:44] <+primax104> i think Max streamed FF 15
[0:25:46] <pirateofpie> @ryong People didn't like the FFX lp? That one was one of my favorites lol
[0:25:50] <SilverFaustX> jrpg are hard to stream, unless its ff7
[0:25:59] <@Solidus_113> mystery box was a mistake
[0:26:00] <ConLin_Arts_> FFX was a fun LP
[0:26:02] <DatAsuna> tasty binge
[0:26:02] <+segatas> I hope new vids of DMC5 go up soon
[0:26:08] <+griffball13> that was a bold move
[0:26:08] <Jashter18> this feels like a short woolie will figure it out
[0:26:09] <+primax104> sunday disappeared for everyone
[0:26:10] <Ryong> DMC5 dump was hilarious
[0:26:11] <gameaholic42> That was the fucking best, especially since it was Sunday
[0:26:11] <%Solidnick18> i binged it
[0:26:13] <+midnightq2> pull that devil trigger
[0:26:13] <%FriedMattato> How did the 20 part dump work out for you, Woolie?
[0:26:19] <jolt05> One of the few RPGs i will never get bored of watching is Valkyrie Profile,that stuff is pure gold
[0:26:20] <MyNameIsRasus> That was a sick
[0:26:22] <seylumiue> You madman! I loved it
[0:26:24] <RyanGelatin> thats the DSP thing to do
[0:26:31] <+griffball13> It's was great
[0:26:32] <fairore> lol
[0:26:33] <%Solidnick18> oh
[0:26:33] <xeros720> haha yeah, it destroyed our feeds
[0:26:36] <Fegorzara> I loved binge watching all of those vids
[0:26:37] <+skylerpilot> @WoolieVersus My feed was never better than on that day Woolie
[0:26:38] <Angry_Ev1L> Was it worth?
[0:26:39] <+TeethMuncher> Psh, Woolie will figure it out
[0:26:40] <xeros720> i blame youtube really
[0:26:40] <Ryong> fuck the feed, but it was hilarious
[0:26:43] <+TheBigO75> Loved the DUMP
[0:26:43] <DatAsuna> DMCV giveth and it taketh away
[0:26:43] <mongol_800> yeah i was annoyed by that too
[0:26:44] <%robobeau> I also wish to know how the Netflix-style dump is working out
[0:26:46] <@mothmandraws> might have been fine if you did like 5 episode dumps
[0:26:46] <+fowlfolk> Eh, I was already a week behind on my feed so it didn't change much :P
[0:26:48] <vVAstrAVv> fuck em! lol
[0:26:50] <%UrsulaCat> WOOL IS GOOD
[0:26:51] <sanctified_succ> I enjoyed it tbh
[0:26:52] <dante34> eyyy bob marley ma nigga
[0:26:52] <gameaholic42> No one else really does Sunday stuff, so that was amazing
[0:26:57] <Luvinsus> I just used a keyword blocker and bam, no DMC on my sub feed
[0:26:58] <apolitenoob> Yo how have I never noticed before, those headphones are rad
[0:26:58] <Jetto_kazama> I liked it
[0:27:00] <%Wool> Thanks, UrsulaCat
[0:27:02] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> I thought the dump was fine but the discussion was dead
[0:27:03] <Ryong> "oh hey another episode" "hold on" "hooooold on" "did they finish it already!?"
[0:27:08] <+SuzakuRising> a feed full of Woolie playing DMC5 is a blessed feed.
[0:27:12] <+tweedler92> nothing ever comes up on the weekend so I enjoyed it
[0:27:12] <Fabric_tester> 8 h of straight amazing content
[0:27:18] <+primax104> I think early watchers have either finished the game or won't play it at all
[0:27:22] <+skylerpilot> @SuzakuRising agreed
[0:27:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> woolieVERGIN
[0:27:26] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> I feel like there's no point to worry about youtube comments continuity when the LP it's already over in terms of editing
[0:27:28] <%FriedMattato> I personally loved the dump, but if it hurt the channel, I'm fine with staggered release again
[0:27:28] <%Solidnick18> idk
[0:27:32] <MyNameIsRasus> Kinda felt like watching compilations back in the day
[0:27:33] <@Commando_Joe> Commando_Joe subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! #BlessThisMess
[0:27:37] <Ryong> it did screw up the discussion on the reddit threads but eh
[0:27:38] <$Superdandy96> Feed blowing up was interesting. Problem was to find the time to watch all of it.
[0:27:41] <%robobeau> Yeah I definitely binged on the series
[0:27:43] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> Did I miss anything?
[0:27:44] <AutechreTwinAphex> just take it in your stride - people look towards you and Pat like people in the Souls community look towards Hob, LobosJr and Vaati for coverage
[0:27:53] <%UrsulaCat> Do not criticize Woolie
[0:27:58] <Nitsuj293> crazy pizza woohoo
[0:28:01] <Straw_Hat_Namaki> Oh what's he talking about? Just came in
[0:28:02] <+midnightq2> BloodTrail
[0:28:09] <Ryong> IT'S FINE
[0:28:15] <+primax104> 5 per day is a good number
[0:28:15] <blucker_blu> ITS FINE
[0:28:16] <+Dascuro> Dascuro subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:28:19] <+DeadpanSoupcan> just put it as one video in the future
[0:28:21] <xeros720> hmm, blocks like that is a decent idea
[0:28:23] <%UrsulaCat> I will cut you if you say anything less than glowing about Woolie
[0:28:24] <Angry_Ev1L> LUL
[0:28:25] <@mothmandraws> I imagine it hit the people who subbed for kirby and tablelords vs the LP subs for unsubbing
[0:28:27] <$eldritchhorrortwitchchat> Criticize reboot instead? vargDorf
[0:28:29] <DatAsuna> When's more Automata? :P
[0:28:31] <%robobeau> What about uploading entire missions at a time?
[0:28:32] <+griffball13> take all the lp
[0:28:35] <@akuda_bar> @UrsulaCat chill
[0:28:38] <+TheBigO75> Dude, stop giving a damn. People will watch. Your content is what people want
[0:28:41] <+segatas> One day I hope you guys do a Bayo series LP
[0:28:41] <%UrsulaCat> No.
[0:28:43] <+Tonku_the_Red> Hey @WoolieVersus I'm curious--what benefits you more, watching the Youtube posts or the Twitch VODs of an LP without skipping ads on either.
[0:28:43] <simifu> !time
[0:28:56] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> Hey @woolieversus remember SSoHPKC? That dump reminded me of the way did things a lot.
[0:28:58] <MyNameIsRasus> If it made some $$$ then hustle on
[0:29:08] <@Menitta> Thats partly true but at the same time
[0:29:08] <blucker_blu> good question @Tonku_the_Red
[0:29:10] <Mrdartgamerinfinity8> But your The Wonderful 101 is great tho- no WONDERFUL!!!!.
[0:29:15] <simifu> Oh yeah, reggie has more time for lps now Kappa
[0:29:26] <Mrdartgamerinfinity8> *LP*
[0:29:26] <+segatas> Wonderful 101 is an amazing game
[0:29:27] <EnderGamma> I liked the dump, but I do enjoy all the stuff you do on the channel not just DMC5
[0:29:32] <+mcjimbo12> @WoolieVersus I think it's a weird situation where there will literally never be another game as hyped up for your section of the internet so people are double thirsty. Plus it'd be weird for you and pat to talk about the game when you beat it but in the LP you're on like, mission 07
[0:29:39] <KeiPrime> doa6 for next get into fighting games tho?
[0:29:40] <+primax104> good game
[0:29:43] <%UrsulaCat> Reggie lps are better than dmcv hot take
[0:29:43] <+korth367> woolie
[0:29:43] <xeros720> w101 is legit as hell, this is like the 3rd lp i've seen of it and i don't care
[0:29:46] <fairore> yay

[0:34:55] <+TheBigO75> Money being printed LIVE
[0:35:00] <+eossg1> and pc developers don't do demos
[0:35:04] <NecDW4> oh god, yeah, that audo demo shit was super retarded
[0:35:06] <KeroKamina> @WoolieVersus just a heads up about Daemon X Machina, you can completely customize your button layout in the pause menu
[0:35:09] <+primax104> did woolie say how many missions of DMC 5 he has done?
[0:35:10] <MyNameIsRasus> What would Pixies Requiem be like?
[0:35:21] <%CrimsonCore90> Demos= evoShill
[0:35:27] <PE4X> @WoolieVersus hey have you heard about the game Break Arts II came out last year and its a mech racing game with customisable mechs trailer looks rad!
[0:35:28] <DatAsuna> Good feature
[0:35:35] <%Vallo99> @mynameisrasus it would be called where is my mind
[0:35:36] <+Tonku_the_Red> Hey @WoolieVersus I'm curious--what benefits you more, watching the Youtube posts or the Twitch VODs of an LP without skipping ads on either.
[0:35:44] <simifu> Prepare for the mech customization PogChamp
[0:35:48] <@Menitta> it controls weird so yeah
[0:35:56] <FridayStreamer> the mech customization in this game is pretty in depth
[0:36:06] <Finaldragoon> @WoolieVersus you can keep the DXM demo forever, you just can't download it anymore
[0:36:25] <%robobeau> Wait didn't the demo end on the 10th? I coulda sworn Liam tweeted about it
[0:36:25] <+luckybudman> luckybudman subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:36:26] <TheAzureOracle> @WoolieVersus Yeah I tested it after it was taken down from the eshop. It still works, for me at least.
[0:36:26] <DarkVinceX> this game makes me wish for a new Armored Core

[0:38:09] <+AtomicVR> DMC5 was my first since DMC1 and totally watching you experiment with Nero helped me get my own grips with how to play
[0:38:09] <%UrsulaCat> you're good
[0:38:11] <wolvenelf> eh no need to cut i think but i understand
[0:38:11] <Am_Shigar00> It's the tragety of going into an action game already knowing the movesets vs. learning them as you go along
[0:38:16] <metroidstar> DO YOU MAN
[0:38:18] <Strange_Journey31> @WoolieVersus You plan to play sekiro?
[0:38:19] <eldrich_horror> maybe put a time stamp for those that want to skip menu stuff?

[0:45:59] <+kahunaburger1> kahunaburger1 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:46:01] <+Grey_Frog> Is it possible the audio isn't supposed to be great at the title? Try going somewhere else in the game and getting different audio?
[0:46:02] <stormingryocan220> quality sounds decent to me
[0:46:03] <%Solidnick18> huh
[0:46:06] <PE4X> sounds like a deep high pass filter

[0:46:09] <%Eeko390> Wack
[0:46:11] <$Tuskor13> @WoolieVersus Try checking with another game to see if the audio is either an issue or just the game itself sounding like this.
[0:46:14] <buerdo> Its nor shit its just not how its suppose to sound
[0:46:15] <KatabolicRage> probably elgato's software being finicky

[0:14:29] <TrafficCohen> KYRIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[0:14:31] <squidpeanut> Woolie, do you intend to stream the wave 3 kirby dlc or nah
[0:14:34] <MettleWolf> Bloody Palace is too much for my weak heart.
[0:14:34] <+mars_driver> @WoolieVersus So you've gotten to the Canon Outcome with regular Vergil?
[0:14:34] <neozz13> No, most people actually beat BP with Super
[0:14:34] <dewyweb> there he is
[0:14:43] <gustavozxd> Trish was the harder to beat for me, she feels very underpowered at times
[0:14:47] <b1gboss007> ( x)Doubt

[0:16:25] <hassanico> Is that Force Edge?
[0:16:28] <Cafe_Spider> but i thought vergil was weak
[0:16:30] <joylent_blue> the fact that he has Air Stinger always throws me off
[0:16:30] <alrobot2014> yep
[0:16:30] <+Eaglestrike117> yeah

[0:17:39] <Sol_Install> This is just a fun mode
[0:17:39] <+Eaglestrike117> technically, vergil killing angelos is him killing himself
[0:17:39] <solidoutlaw> I hate these enemies

[0:18:35] <+Hilleltaco> Woulda thought you'd judgement cut the Chimeras instead. They're not that hard, I just think they're annoying
[0:18:36] <WG101> @megamonmon123 sexual desire is foolishness
[0:18:39] <nnif> SHCUM
[0:18:40] <jeecay> Virgil = sword sniper

[0:18:53] <joylent_blue> vergil is so fucking cool, GOD
[0:19:09] <MettleWolf> Summon sword blended is too good
[0:19:09] <WG101> THAT CASUAL WALK

[0:19:33] <+Eaglestrike117> you dont gotta work to be sylish with vergil
[0:19:37] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> TWO HITS
[0:19:37] <Shiranui24> @WoolieVersus you keep that one summon sword tho thats nice
[0:19:38] <bazz_tv> that is like asking to hold charge shots between rounds
[0:19:40] <Proeaten> Trying to do BLOODY palace without a full health bar? You got some big balls

[0:20:01] <+Okicop> I now get why some lady would totally bone zone him. One look at that sweet finisher, boom.
[0:20:07] <gunstar73> Cool thanks dude
[0:20:08] <OwlLightningMage> Vergil is only cool when he's shooting babies Kappa
[0:20:10] <justcauseican4> God I fucking love this game
[0:20:11] <TheFilth> Mastering the perfect timings on judgment cuts is the hypest shit
[0:20:16] <hassanico> 90 floors left bois!
[0:20:17] <gustavozxd> at least it's not DmC Vergelle
[0:20:17] <megamonmon123> vergil turned his virgin points into style points
[0:20:19] <TheAzureGamer> But where's his kickass fedora though
[0:20:20] <+dodge_and_dust> yeah. Nero can hold charge adn EX guage in BP
[0:20:24] <bazz_tv> @neozz13 is that a SE revision? because in vanilla 4 you can't
[0:20:27] <+KgKid51> Vergin FailFish
[0:20:28] <joylent_blue> he's the kind of cool that makes me mad
[0:20:32] <bazz_tv> I know for sure
[0:20:33] <megamonmon123> but dante is the ultimate virgin
[0:20:34] <WaxWitch> just marry him already jeez LUL
[0:20:39] <+seaearthandsky> hi woolz
[0:20:42] <pluswplus> i wonder if character power will be more similar to SE or vanilla in 5
[0:20:43] <Shiranui24> "I don't want to do this fight" - Judgement cut end
[0:20:43] <MettleWolf> Beowulf > Gilgamesh
[0:20:46] <syanvpg> You play really well Woolie, it not those SSS videos but thats ridiculus, is the kind of good play where i can see how you are doing it and i wish i could play like that
[0:20:47] <yuribo26> @joylent_blue right? It shouldn't be allowed to be this cool
[0:20:52] <RenzoTheLion> please woolie you must prove to us you can just frame judgment cut
[0:20:52] <bazz_tv> you can keep exceed levels between floors but no charge shots on the blue rose
[0:20:53] <gunstar73> Woo lie is such a fanboy dude
[0:20:53] <FatDragonQuest> these are imho my favorite enemies in 4
[0:20:53] <megamonmon123> fan theory : the more of virgin you are the stronger you are
[0:20:55] <OwlLightningMage> I wonder if they'll put in a playable Sparta in 5
[0:20:55] <Fourson> @WoolieVersus are you aware of vergil's just frame judgement cut? it's so sick
[0:20:56] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Habe you tried Lady and Trish yet? They are so much fun too!
[0:20:57] <neozz13> @bazz_tv Maybe than but you totally can now
[0:21:05] <megamonmon123> sparda died when he got laid
[0:21:07] <+Eaglestrike117> dude woolies tried everyone
[0:21:08] <gustavozxd> playing Vergil in DmC is just so underwhelming, he has killer bee but it looks so awful
[0:21:10] <+Eaglestrike117> all the guys have
[0:21:11] <megamonmon123> vergil lost when he got lakd
[0:21:14] <+SaltySkeleton12> Does that kick cross up?!?
[0:21:14] <bazz_tv> dang i need a ps4 or a decent pc
[0:21:17] <FatDragonQuest> oof the vsync
[0:21:19] <itsya_boi_gappy> SCUM
[0:21:20] <megamonmon123> *laid
[0:21:21] <pluswplus> sc UM
[0:21:21] <+Hilleltaco> Always liked Mega Scarecrows. Easy stagger but high health means you can do apatBig combo
[0:21:25] <joylent_blue> Lady is SUPER fun, in a really unique way
[0:21:26] <gunstar73> I’ve never seen someone mark out over a character so hard
[0:21:29] <yuribo26> @bazz_tv my shitty ass pc ran this without much problem
[0:21:31] <neozz13> @megamonmon123 So Dante is the strongest
[0:21:33] <megamonmon123> if you have sex your demon power decreases
[0:21:34] <nnif> So uh, MvC4 rumors...
[0:21:38] <WG101> NI FEAR
[0:21:40] <+Eaglestrike117> Hey azure you should TTS Right now to keep him honest
[0:21:41] <jeecay> @megamonmon123 He tried no nut november and well...we got nero
[0:21:41] <gustavozxd> lady is just dmc2, hold square, release
[0:21:41] <megamonmon123> @neozz13 hell yeah
[0:21:42] <WG101> @nnif no way
[0:21:42] <Siregulus> where's the Angelo Must Die difficulty when you fight a bunch of armored squadrons
[0:21:44] <Nomad_Scholar> Best Boi of the Zaibatsu
[0:21:53] <bazz_tv> don't underestimate how shit my pc is @yuribo26
[0:21:55] <RenzoTheLion> @Fourson he might actually not know
[0:21:57] <eggsnbakefest> It looks like the bumped up Lunar Phase to fucking 20 from DMC3
[0:22:01] <+Ulltraman7> Lunar Phase for Lunar Life
[0:22:02] <+Eaglestrike117> Do it, Mortis him
[0:22:06] <WG101> FUCKING TELEPORTED
[0:22:07] <+KgKid51> The washing machine lol
[0:22:08] <WG101> TO DOGDE
[0:22:09] <+AkronymCLT> I love that in DT Lunar Phase becomes an extended combo
[0:22:12] <yuribo26> @bazz_tv noted LUL , but my pc was super shitty too, but I really don't know your situation
[0:22:13] <WG101> BY USING THE SUPER
[0:22:16] <TheArrow_> I didn't like Lady when I first played her, but now I think she's great. I wish Trish had more going on, though.
[0:22:17] <MettleWolf> The frame stops make his moves so epic
[0:22:18] <+wreativecriting> are Subscribes disabled or something?
[0:22:18] <joylent_blue> Trish has ELECTRIC LUNAR PHASE its sick
[0:22:20] <+askalta> that was dope
[0:22:20] <megamonmon123> no virgins have died in dmc
[0:22:24] <gigiaten> Not using Force Edge? RRRRREEEEEEE
[0:22:24] <jack_s1n> since Vergil needs a concentration meter doesn't that make Dante default better lore wise?
[0:22:27] <denam_of_windscale> tfw lunar phase jump cancels
[0:22:30] <+Eaglestrike117> Also Vergil has a style when to comes to banging
[0:22:30] <FatDragonQuest> yeah I hope bloody palace 5 takes out the time limit
[0:22:33] <iziwings> it's rapid slash to reflect it with vergil right
[0:22:34] <+ssaltyflavor> Trish getting Rising Sun is wack, give it back to the guy
[0:22:35] <megamonmon123> demon power is just virgin power
[0:22:37] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> 4 HITS
[0:22:38] <+Eaglestrike117> You Judgemnet nut then trick up
[0:22:40] <GohanEgret> reset
[0:22:40] <+VVardy> Woolie not using the beautiful summoned sword skyfall, disappointing
[0:22:44] <+Evitron1> here's a fact: i would love if donte appeared in DMC5 alongside dante and nero. i would break shit, it would be so rad
[0:22:44] <mr_ESB> Trying to combo Vergils sword spin taunt Kreygasm
[0:22:46] <+Hilleltaco> Rapid slash is good for Angelos, goes through their shield so you can hit them from behind
[0:22:46] <Shiranui24> @WoolieVersus always style Woolie. it's more important.
[0:22:47] <Make_me_mad> DMC 4 is probably my least favorite version of Bloody Palace.
[0:22:48] <neozz13> @jack_s1n The gameplay mechanics are not canon lore things
[0:22:50] <etalmeta> @jack_s1n Dante already is better in the lore
[0:22:51] <yuribo26> ANIMEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[0:22:52] <eggsnbakefest> WHAT IS THAT MOVE
[0:22:53] <megamonmon123> nero stopped being a virgin and got his devil arm take
[0:22:54] <bazz_tv> yeah Dante achieved maximum wizardly levels long time ago
[0:22:55] <Sarumarine> Is Devil My Cry the origin of 'did you get hit? You get no rank?'
[0:22:55] <+Ulltraman7> It's just unfair
[0:22:56] <blackorchidKI2> Cut! Cut! Cut!
[0:22:56] <joylent_blue> FUCK WHAT
[0:22:58] <GoogleyGareth> LUL
[0:23:01] <FatDragonQuest> h-how!? I never knew you could do that!
[0:23:01] <+SaltySkeleton12> What is the blue meter above his life bar?
[0:23:02] <MettleWolf> DOUBLE DAMAGE
[0:23:02] <iziwings> COUNTERHIT
[0:23:03] <denam_of_windscale> LUL
[0:23:04] <sangi53> RESET
[0:23:04] <ChineseNininga> Wait a minute if the Bianco Angelo is made out of bits and pieces of Nelo Angelo why would Vergil met any of the Angelos in his campaign
[0:23:05] <spawnzie> RESET
[0:23:06] <joylent_blue> GREAT
[0:23:07] <+cvp5127> reset
[0:23:08] <joylent_blue> I LOVE IT
[0:23:10] <+Wreckinize> can you turn the music up a bit @WoolieVersus ?
[0:23:13] <asbestos_man45> "hue shall diieee"
[0:23:13] <gustavozxd> don't worry scarecrows attacks are lame
[0:23:15] <mrlastchance1> Yo can we just call out woolie for losing in soul caliber against the rooster teeth folks?
[0:23:18] <+thesw1tch> @woolzuto annyeong!
[0:23:20] <OwlLightningMage> Getting hurt while taunting should instantly kill you LUL
[0:23:20] <joylent_blue> rapid slash spam is way too fun
[0:23:20] <+Eaglestrike117> @ChineseNininga Shut up, thats how
[0:23:30] <Make_me_mad> I hope in 5 it's either like DMC 3, or mix in something like Bayo 2's Verse cards to mix it up.
[0:23:32] <neozz13> @chinesenininga It’s not canon
[0:23:34] <skywardknight0> donguri would have beat the game already
[0:23:35] <+bonzosan> woolie show me your hands
[0:23:38] <gunstar73> Yeah woolie why did you throw
[0:23:39] <bazz_tv> are you trying to do the summondsword taunt?
[0:23:40] <+TsunamiPoro> Looking at this its basically a singleplayer fighting game which is probably why Woolie loves it
[0:23:42] <Shiranui24> YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[0:23:43] <WG101> SHORYUREPPA
[0:23:43] <+Solidnick18> Kreygasm
[0:23:44] <blackorchidKI2> SHORYU REPPA
[0:23:46] <mr_ESB> Is nero or vergil easier?
[0:23:47] <joylent_blue> NICE
[0:23:52] <Siregulus> I don't know how but Vergil just gets increasingly more hype with all the different Judgement Cuts
[0:23:52] <sangi53> wow it's like watching donguri990 right now
[0:23:54] <joylent_blue> mr_ESB vergil
[0:23:54] <@Commando_Joe> Are you accusing Woolie of pulling a Snoop Dogg? @bonzosan
[0:23:55] <ChineseNininga> Alrighty then
[0:23:55] <gustavozxd> OOOH NO
[0:23:59] <bazz_tv> but can you canle it into a tatsu like Pat never did?

[0:24:09] <megamonmon123> this viŕgin theory woŕks too well
[0:24:09] <MrFlabby1> Lunar phase is all you need
[0:24:12] <yuribo26> GETTING HIT, FAKE FAN LUL
[0:24:13] <jeecay> You guys think vergil ever no sells massive damage like dante? or does he just just dust himself off like it didn't happen?
[0:24:14] <+bonzosan> huh wuh
[0:24:21] <WG101> SHOOT WITH SWORD
[0:24:21] <@mothmandraws> I finally made it to a stream
[0:24:22] <AgentJin> I'm so painfully attracted to Vergil
[0:24:23] <gustavozxd> it's the colored enemies from DmC but worse
[0:24:27] <+Eaglestrike117> Ay moth
[0:24:31] <asbestos_man45> But he's one of mundus'
[0:24:34] <yuribo26> @AgentJin same FeelsBadMan

[0:24:46] <MettleWolf> Handled hat like a pro
[0:24:47] <+Xanax44> Oh hey I was doing Vergil's Bloody Palace like twenty minutes ago, what a coincidence
[0:24:50] <@mothmandraws> 1:20
[0:24:53] <gunstar73> Vergil definitely no sells Because he thinks it’s cooler
[0:24:53] <reiface08> dementia sets in early
[0:24:56] <joylent_blue> its ok woolie, we understand
[0:24:57] <+VVardy> Blitz is definitely a made only for Nero demon
[0:25:00] <mr_ESB> Yea i think vergil has more op stuff than nero
[0:25:02] <OwlLightningMage> Even lame Vergil is cool
[0:25:03] <+C0MTRYA> when in doubt scum it out
[0:25:03] <@mothmandraws> ill be up till 4-5am anyway
[0:25:03] <rosabellamelantha> Are you kidding, Blitz with Nero and Dante are really easy to kill same with Lady
[0:25:05] <joylent_blue> vergil is too distracting
[0:25:11] <+Eaglestrike117> also yeah its 20 past 1 in the morning for us UK lads
[0:25:16] <jeecay> @gunstar73 you have an excellent screenname

[0:25:24] <neozz13> @woolieversus after Blitz loses shield with Vergil, use the rainstorm with swords, shoryureppa and distort
[0:25:24] <+Ssaik> UK lads represent!
[0:25:27] <yuribo26> LOOK AT THAT ANIMEEEEEE

[0:25:47] <eggsnbakefest> Hey, just out of curious, and cuz I've been really out of the loop, @WoolieVersus @mothmandraws is there not gonna be any more Kingdom Death? I know it's been a while
[0:25:51] <gigiaten> Woolie is getting exposed LUL LUL LUL cant even handle Blitz
[0:25:53] <+Eaglestrike117> Hey moth you ivading pat later too?
[0:25:54] <iziwings> playing through dmd recently i finally figured blitz out with nero and dante and even then it still fucks me up
[0:25:55] <FatDragonQuest> is it wrong to say some of the bosses are kind of the weak parts of 4?
[0:25:56] <joylent_blue> i always fudge the DT trick dodges FeelsBadMan
[0:25:56] <ChineseNininga> Azure tts MORTIS you coward
[0:25:57] <gustavozxd> Dante's pandora, try beating blitz with Trish's pandora LUL

[0:25:58] <neozz13> @vvardy Except you only meet it with Dante in default campaign?
[0:25:59] <+Solidnick18> that's nuts
[0:26:02] <+mcjimbo12> i gotta be honest i kind of hate berial, his aoe explosion moves feels super annoying to dodge
[0:26:06] <mr_ESB> Playing bloody palace and cleared a floor....And then a blitz appears WutFace
[0:26:12] <+SinisterBroccoli> does Vergil not get dizzy?
[0:26:14] <copyritetm> snipe mundus' son vergil
[0:26:14] <gustavozxd> Trish's guns feel like they do 0 damage
[0:26:15] <TangledVirus> Dosen't Vergil have Real Distorted Impact?
[0:26:19] <RenzoTheLion> playing as efficiently as possible i see
[0:26:19] <WG101> F L A S H K I C K
[0:26:23] <denam_of_windscale> can't you enemy step out of lunar phase? you don't have to trick after, right?
[0:26:24] <+vampirate1> @woolieversus I recently watched psychonauts pt 3, and decided to go play it to see why its so praised. hit a game breaking bug in one of the last levels, where a pole vault had no collision.
[0:26:32] <Oqzar> why is trick down DT only NotLikeThis
[0:26:32] <MettleWolf> What if Vergil could Royal Guard?
[0:26:34] <asbestos_man45> technically trish is Mundus' daughter
[0:26:43] <+VVardy> @neozz13 I'm thinking in terms of how to kill him the easiest, because you can one shot break his shield, then four buster him and he dies
[0:26:43] <rosabellamelantha> @itsya_boi_gappy Look up the video "blitz are easy" it details various methods to just style on Blitz and it's real easy to pull off with dante
[0:26:46] <TrafficCohen> Making her Berial's sister?
[0:26:46] <bazz_tv> I like how with Nero Berial gives you time to do a maximum bet at the start
[0:26:47] <gustavozxd> -> trangle a whole lot eh
[0:26:48] <@Commando_Joe> ok but could Vergil defeat Disney's Hercules tho
[0:26:49] <@mothmandraws> me an woolie talked about it a while back, decisions need to be made in how we would continue it
[0:26:54] <iziwings> no shoyrureppa smh
[0:26:55] <jeecay> I conquered the fire hell once....wasn't that hard...
[0:26:56] <Proeaten> The more I see of berial the more I just think he's teostera from monster hunter, you even had to fight one to get dantes gear in world
[0:26:57] <@mothmandraws> ppl have been kinda busy though
[0:26:57] <mr_ESB> Still learning Guard Fly
[0:26:57] <joylent_blue> his key evasion moves being locked behind DT does annoy me
[0:27:06] <neozz13> @gustavozxd Trish has the strongest handgun shots , what
[0:27:07] <itsya_boi_gappy> @rosabellamelantha ok thanks !
[0:27:08] <joylent_blue> blah blah balance whatever >:(
[0:27:08] <+Hilleltaco> @TangledVirus Vergil doesn't have Real Impact, but I think he can distort his charge punches
[0:27:20] <+Hilleltaco> Especially since concentration gives him a third charge level
[0:27:22] <denam_of_windscale> @mr_ESB omg guard flying
[0:27:22] <eggsnbakefest> I gotcha. You guys super made me want to play it, I've been trying to get TTS and friends to play it with cuz it looks super fun
[0:27:23] <+ArmoredDeath> atpRtsd
[0:27:26] <gustavozxd> @neozz13 if you have DT sure
[0:27:27] <gyrobasel> you rely too much on lunar phase
[0:27:27] <eggsnbakefest> No luck on either
[0:27:31] <eggsnbakefest> Thanks tho, man!
[0:27:33] <yuribo26> They see me rolling, they hatin
[0:27:33] <+DreyfussFrost> :(
[0:27:34] <SaltsuNoHadou> This isn’t nero >:^(
[0:27:35] <bazz_tv> does the shoryureppa with vergil had real impact distorsion properties with DT?
[0:27:42] <iziwings> yes
[0:27:45] <joylent_blue> yep
[0:27:45] <Shiranui24> he really does
[0:27:48] <@mothmandraws> its a fun game, just a long campaign, and cause its online sometimes tricky to find time everyone is free
[0:27:56] <FatDragonQuest> yeah KDM is really fun even as a solo game
[0:27:57] <TangledVirus> @Hilleltaco I see, I'll try that. I mostly only play as Dante.
[0:28:00] <neozz13> @vvardy With Dante you just shotgun or Lucifer his shield and he dies in 2 real impacts at most
[0:28:05] <iziwings> you can oneshot the saviour with distorted shoryu reppa lmao
[0:28:06] <deviljhojho94> Kill them all Woolie
[0:28:07] <mr_ESB> Barely sort of got guard fly but not consistent yet
[0:28:07] <joylent_blue> FUCK THAT
[0:28:10] <joylent_blue> I HATE THAT
[0:28:10] <+Th3SmartAlec> Funny, playing this right now
[0:28:10] <RenzoTheLion> can you tell lunar phase is his favorite move
[0:28:11] <WG101> you gotta kill black sabbath, woolie
[0:28:14] <@mothmandraws> im kinda tempted to do vid series of building and painting my KDM set
[0:28:14] <FatDragonQuest> I don't think I got far in my solo run but I do wanna try it again
[0:28:14] <TheFilth> If they do make Vergil playable in V I wonder if they’ll stick with his Beowulf and Force Edge style or do something new
[0:28:15] <bazz_tv> cool
[0:28:21] <gunstar73> Yea I enjoyed the dnd thing good shit moth
[0:28:31] <nolifegamin> I usually don't like spinny moves, but lunar phase is sick
[0:28:39] <FatDragonQuest> @mothmandraws do it man!! build and painting videos are fun!
[0:28:41] <eggsnbakefest> I bet that'd be pretty cool. Every time I pitch it to friends, I never get any takers, but I'm hoping one day I will
[0:28:42] <DrFacilier> whens mavel
[0:28:43] <Sokumotanaka> @gunstar73 D&D thing?
[0:28:44] <ConfusedCultist> Thing with KDM is that its not only a long campaign but a tpk followev by a village murderzone can happen at any time
[0:28:44] <Shiranui24> he uses it too much
[0:28:45] <+Th3SmartAlec> yeyeye
[0:28:45] <joylent_blue> why does he say it like that "SHCUM"
[0:28:46] <bazz_tv> krizalid get out of the screen
[0:28:47] <+thebestestkevin> @mothmandraws YE DOEET
[0:28:53] <neozz13> @gustavozxd No, without DT. She gets rid of Mephisto and Faust cloaks the fastest and does the most raw damage with them
[0:28:54] <mr_ESB> Inb4 blitz
[0:29:00] <mr_ESB> Aww lol
[0:29:03] <nolifegamin> doesn't Vergil have the Devil Bringer in V? what if he just uses that?
[0:29:04] <gunstar73> Woolie did dnd thing on woolie vs
[0:29:08] <WG101> @joylent_blue because he's nasally
[0:29:10] <+Th3SmartAlec> Fire doggos are the absolute worst
[0:29:11] <WaxWitch> !uptime
[0:29:13] <bazz_tv> you should had saved that DT meter for the blitz
[0:29:19] <@mothmandraws> im thinking of doing something not as big of commitment to start with of just doing a monthly "this is whats on my painting table" vid
[0:29:19] <gustavozxd> @neozz13 with the pistols? or are you talking about pandora?
[0:29:22] <deviljhojho94> That Kingdom death series was really good
[0:29:23] <Sokumotanaka> @gunstar73 ooooh that
[0:29:24] <gunstar73> Old vids
[0:29:24] <joylent_blue> nasally boi
[0:29:24] <Fourson> @WoolieVersus if you release judgement cut the instant it hits the charge, it's much faster and higher damage. Fits the flow of combat much better but it's a lot like max act, you gotta grind it a lot.
[0:29:25] <deviljhojho94> Shame it had to be canned
[0:29:32] <@mothmandraws> currently finishing up painting my titanicus titans
[0:29:35] <gustavozxd> as long as vergil doesn't have that dumbass slow sword moveset from DmC
[0:29:35] <FatDragonQuest> So reminder: Dan Southworth played the Quantum Ranger in Power Rangers Time Force and was the best
[0:29:38] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus In the LP Pat mentioned how Dante just one-shots a lot of enemies in cutscenes, but remember how in DMC1 that was a mechanic? It's almost like in DMC4 Dante just decides not to do that in-game because it's less fun...
[0:29:46] <bazz_tv> told ya
[0:29:47] <mr_ESB> Yeaaaaa
[0:29:48] <joylent_blue> FUCK
[0:29:48] <Lion_kun> Woolie's absurdly large sub notifications are constantly getting in the way of the game
[0:29:51] <+BTap> usedAAAA
[0:29:54] <neozz13> @gustavozxd Pistols, that’s why I said handguns. Capcom even said this pre release
[0:29:55] <RenzoTheLion> @Fourson one day he will learn
[0:30:04] <+Th3SmartAlec> Projectile asshole in the back
[0:30:05] <bazz_tv> should had saved judgement cut end for this
[0:30:06] <Superdandy96> I know Woolie played Spider-man PS4, but does he plan on playing the dlc once they’re all out?
[0:30:06] <reiface08> why is woolie only using lunar phase?
[0:30:10] <Fourson> it's fine, he can't even read chat lol
[0:30:15] <EL_TRO> When's Guilty Gear Casuals
[0:30:17] <+Th3SmartAlec> Nioce dodge
[0:30:21] <+Hilleltaco> @neozz13 Sure you're not thinking of Lady? She has by far the best guns
[0:30:21] <@mothmandraws> lol the green screened chie
[0:30:22] <+thebestestkevin> @mothmandraws you can even do vids showing off your 40k stuff, would be pretty cool imo
[0:30:24] <FatDragonQuest> god hitting blitz when charging up his fun
[0:30:28] <deviljhojho94> POGGERS
[0:30:30] <+VVardy> His kamikaze attack is a pain
[0:30:31] <mr_ESB> He Guard flying PogChamp
[0:30:33] <iziwings> blitz is so goddamn cool
[0:30:33] <deviljhojho94> Oh no poggers
[0:30:33] <+Solidnick18> well then
[0:30:37] <deviljhojho94> PogChamp
[0:30:39] <eggsnbakefest> Vergil as dlc for smash, amiright
[0:30:40] <gustavozxd> @neozz13 that's crazy, my whole run in bp they did nothing at all without dt
[0:30:43] <gunstar73> It really is just a zinogre
[0:30:49] <bazz_tv> you should try ti time a judgment cut while the blitz is doing the lazer
[0:30:51] <joker_joestar> Did he do Nero's BP?
[0:30:56] <AgentJin> @Solidnick18 Yooo what's good pal?
[0:30:57] <neozz13> @hilleltaco No she doesn’t. I’m not talking about charge shot, I’m talking about raw handgun shots
[0:30:57] <+Th3SmartAlec> Stream couldnt handle the summon swords
[0:31:05] <+Eaglestrike117> if moth did videos on his 40K stuff it would be a 6 hour video
[0:31:07] <+Eaglestrike117> he has so much
[0:31:13] <0rond> oh my god woolie i can't believe you lost to michael in soul calibur. you robbed us of an extra fisticuffs match
[0:31:17] <joylent_blue> RIP that dogoo
[0:31:19] <ConfusedCultist> 40k is bomb though
[0:31:19] <joylent_blue> doggo
[0:31:20] <RenzoTheLion> one more lunar phase for the road
[0:31:22] <+Eaglestrike117> also do the mortis moth, do it
[0:31:25] <+higuydaze> Why is vergil so fucking cool man
[0:31:28] <deviljhojho94> Michael powered trough with his rage
[0:31:33] <@mothmandraws> eh probably not actually , think I could cover most things in 2-3 hours
[0:31:34] <GohanEgret> @joker_joestar no, he is on run 1 of vergil
[0:31:36] <EL_TRO> Your motivation meter is too low
[0:31:36] <+Hilleltaco> @neozz13 Huh, could be true I guess. Can't really say since I never played Trish much
[0:31:37] <gunstar73> Cuz he’s blue
[0:31:40] <neozz13> @gustavozxd It’s not crazy, they do the most damage of any handgun shots
[0:31:40] <bazz_tv> nneds more force edge
[0:31:43] <deviljhojho94> And if anime has taught me something is that rage as a powerup triumphs skill
[0:31:43] <@mothmandraws> most of my collection isnt even 40k
[0:31:44] <iziwings> rapid slash invul through the blitz explosion PogChamp
[0:31:53] <joker_joestar> Trish > Lady
[0:31:54] <TrafficCohen> Fantasy?
[0:31:59] <TrafficCohen> Or Sigmar?
[0:32:02] <+Th3SmartAlec> you got your DMC4 clips so you can DMC while you FMC

[0:32:08] <+TsunamiPoro> @joker_joestar oh wow thats an opinion
[0:32:09] <jeecay> He's off his groove
[0:32:09] <InfiniteSwagbito> I MADE IT
[0:32:12] <+Menitta> @woolieversus how are you canceling rapid slash like that? Trick before the animation finishes?
[0:32:14] <InfiniteSwagbito> TO A WOOLIE STREAM
[0:32:15] <DesperaDo2077> Lady>Trish
[0:32:17] <+SaltySkeleton12> Balls have been revealed
[0:32:18] <+TsunamiPoro> ^
[0:32:18] <deviljhojho94> @joker_joestar what the fuck man
[0:32:20] <Shiranui24> oh nice
[0:32:23] <+TsunamiPoro> Lady best girl
[0:32:24] <joker_joestar> Gameplay I meant
[0:32:25] <ConfusedCultist> Lady>Trish anyday
[0:32:25] <+Ulltraman7> BACKIN
[0:32:26] <mr_ESB> Still not used to Ladys playstyle
[0:32:27] <gustavozxd> @neozz13 well i guess handguns are just weak as shit in dmc4 then cuz goddamn, even in dmd the guns deal decent damage in 3
[0:32:27] <Morning_Asakura> #LADY STANS RISE UP
[0:32:28] <jeecay> @DesperaDo2077 the truth
[0:32:32] <Nomad_Scholar> Lady 4ever
[0:32:34] <+Solidnick18> lady is best girl Kreygasm
[0:32:35] <EL_TRO> wait, Vergil doesn't have his own theme?
[0:32:35] <+Th3SmartAlec> @Menitta The RB + B teleport cancels it
[0:32:36] <+Eaglestrike117> the balls are exposed every day
[0:32:40] <FatDragonQuest> okay I'll be honest llady>Trish but Trish's gameplay is so much more fun
[0:32:42] <Nomad_Scholar> LADY FOR LIFE
[0:32:43] <Shiranui24> lady is awesome
[0:32:44] <neozz13> Trish is best girl.
[0:32:45] <deviljhojho94> ATTENTION ALL NON LADY STANS: PLEASE EVACUATE THE PREMISES
[0:32:46] <+TsunamiPoro> I'm gay and i would still go for lady
[0:32:47] <+Th3SmartAlec> @Menitta Spam that shit all day
[0:32:48] <gunstar73> Nah lady over trish everyday unless you mean play style wise
[0:32:48] <DrFacilier> bang bang bang
[0:32:48] <joker_joestar> But yh Trish > character-wise
[0:32:48] <+Eaglestrike117> its a miracle when the balls are concealed for once
[0:32:49] <gustavozxd> if we're talking about gameplay nothing>lady and trish
[0:32:49] <+Hilleltaco> @Menitta Yeah I think that's what he's doing. it also cancels into itself in DT
[0:32:51] <TrafficCohen> Lady is best everything
[0:32:53] <MettleWolf> Lady, Trish, Lucia > Kat
[0:32:55] <bazz_tv> Lady x Dante is the superior ship, so says Reuben Langdon himself
[0:32:55] <GohanEgret> DMC3 Lady > DMC5 Lady > DMC4 Lady, don't you dare @ me
[0:32:57] <iziwings> god damn are these dudes easier to fight with vergil than dante
[0:33:02] <InfiniteSwagbito> Fighting the gladius with vergil is the easiest shit, I love it
[0:33:04] <+TsunamiPoro> @MettleWolf you got it right tho
[0:33:05] <traellium> 800 people wtf
[0:33:10] <RenzoTheLion> trick cancelling is very important when playing the Vergil
[0:33:11] <mr_ESB> Cutlass' + Blitz WutFace
[0:33:13] <nolifegamin> @GohanEgret no you're pretty correct, 15 year old girls ARE the best
[0:33:13] <ChineseNininga> @GohanEgret you are right
[0:33:15] <skykingcrow> @GohanEgret
[0:33:16] <SuperSaiyanSora> you all wrong. Kyrie is best girl doodSinwata
[0:33:16] <Make_me_mad> I had a lot of fun with Lady's play style. Gunslinger but actually good is cool.
[0:33:16] <Proeaten> Lady is easily the best dmc waifu
[0:33:18] <joylent_blue> LUL
[0:33:21] <InfiniteSwagbito> Oh man I love going "Nope" to a room like that
[0:33:22] <Morning_Asakura> @GohanEgret I'll @ that very correct statement
[0:33:25] <deviljhojho94> PogChamp crikChamp
[0:33:26] <+Menitta> I know it can cancel itself in DT
[0:33:31] <GohanEgret> @nolifegamin FBI open up
[0:33:32] <TheArrow_> Lady is cooler than Virgil. Go ahead and @ me.
[0:33:35] <neozz13> @nolifegamin 16 - 17
[0:33:40] <bazz_tv> Kyrie does have the best booty
[0:33:41] <@mothmandraws> so is woolie going for a world record, no damage run
[0:33:41] <deviljhojho94> @TheArrow_
[0:33:46] <+Th3SmartAlec> Honestly the swords ain't bad in Bloody Palace (if youre not Dante or Trish)
[0:33:47] <+TsunamiPoro> @TheArrow_ ur right
[0:33:53] <joylent_blue> @TheArrow_ wheres the lie tho
[0:33:54] <SuperSaiyanSora> @bazz_tv YEAAAAA! doodGood
[0:33:55] <+Eaglestrike117> He failed that on floor 3 moth
[0:33:56] <ChineseNininga> @Menitta Just spam the teleport summon sword thingy, you can cancel pretty much anything with it
[0:33:59] <+VVardy> I'm so happy DMC5 has lockon switching so you don't lockon to the wrong enemy like you do in 4
[0:34:01] <neozz13> @make_me_mad You mean like Dante’s in 3
[0:34:02] <MettleWolf> Look at that pro strat
[0:34:04] <GohanEgret> thank you to all the people who @'d me, you are blessed with good opinions
[0:34:10] <gustavozxd> it's unbelievable to me that there's people who actually like Kyrie, does she ever say anything other than "nero" the whole game?
[0:34:12] <+Th3SmartAlec> Oh boy this room
[0:34:16] <gunstar73> He’s already half dead
[0:34:18] <+JayEarly> Dante can kill the swords with one shotgun blast
[0:34:20] <FatDragonQuest> did DMC5 ever say if it was gonna have softlock?
[0:34:25] <jeecay> GUN TO YOUR HEAD CHAT!! you get one devil arm and one gun type to take on a room full of demons. What's your pick?
[0:34:26] <nolifegamin> @GohanEgret I've kept my door opened for years
[0:34:27] <eggsnbakefest> @mothmandraws I think if he was he already lost
[0:34:31] <TheArrow_> @VVardy L3 switches in 4
[0:34:34] <deviljhojho94> Is this what this once proud chat has been reduced to? @ing at people for validation?
[0:34:35] <Glaicus> YE YE YE YE
[0:34:37] <deviljhojho94> I have to say i like it
[0:34:40] <@mothmandraws> DMC5 should have a battle royal mode
[0:34:41] <Morning_Asakura> hope kyrie is fleshed out more in V but I doubt it
[0:34:42] <+ravenrooke> @jeecay Yamato and EnI
[0:34:45] <gunstar73> People just like the hot nice girl and that’s ok
[0:34:45] <iziwings> that last hit of the dt combo is so nice
[0:34:46] <RenzoTheLion> @jeecay Red Queen and Blue Rose ez
[0:34:47] <neozz13> @jeecay Sparda
[0:34:55] <mr_ESB> Vergil spinning the sword on his finger looks so cool
[0:34:57] <+wsmccall> @jeecay Yamato and Shotgun
[0:34:57] <+Xanax44> @jeecay Cerberus and coyote A
[0:34:58] <joker_joestar> Pointing in the direction wen locking on usually works fine
[0:34:59] <InfiniteSwagbito> Woolie, if you have DT and see a bunch of Frosts about to pop in, just Judgement Cut End those shits and you're good
[0:35:00] <bazz_tv> I wonder if Nero ever squeezed Kyrie's ass with the demon bringer
[0:35:00] <joylent_blue> rapid slash is too fun
[0:35:00] <+WindUpEstinien> take a shot for every lunar phase
[0:35:01] <denam_of_windscale> @jeecay cerberus and coyote
[0:35:01] <gunstar73> But she really doesn’t do much tbh
[0:35:01] <ConfusedCultist> I think Kirye will have a minor role in V
[0:35:05] <gustavozxd> I can't wait to see Pat and Woolie's reaction to that new DmC ending where Dino slowly puts his hand on Kat's ass LUL
[0:35:11] <+Hilleltaco> @gustavozxd Hey now, she says Credo too Kappa
[0:35:13] <+Eaglestrike117> Moth, i dont think anything can contain 100 people style beasting on eachther

[0:35:21] <+Solidnick18> oh nice
[0:35:22] <deviljhojho94> God that looks so cool
[0:35:23] <TheFilth> I got lucky enough to try the demo, the lock-on flows so much better with the new animation transfers
[0:35:24] <jeecay> Excellent choices
[0:35:26] <joylent_blue> PHEW
[0:35:28] <+kraftium> this and the next floor is the ones that always kill me
[0:35:35] <+Eaglestrike117> The servers, your console, the world would implode cause too much style
[0:35:36] <MettleWolf> @mothmandraws battle royal and guns do more damage
[0:35:36] <+JayEarly> @jeecay Beowulf and uh Coyote A
[0:35:39] <+mr_falco_punch> epic dodge
[0:35:43] <+VVardy> Isn't the next floor just the seeds?
[0:35:43] <iziwings> god damn this dude is everywhere in bloody palace
[0:35:44] <+JayEarly> I know how to punch and shoot shotguns

[0:36:29] <+mars_driver> Can't wait to see Vergil's moves in 5.
[0:36:33] <ChineseNininga> that would be RAD
[0:36:34] <+thebestestkevin> @nolifegamin you tread on a path that pat dares not go
[0:36:35] <ConfusedCultist> Now chaos legion is a game I played when I was a dumb kid and I barely have memory of it
[0:36:36] <Siregulus> look at all these floating Black Sabbaths
[0:36:36] <+Th3SmartAlec> @nolifegamin *Star Fox voice* Good luck!
[0:36:38] <+thebestestkevin> I wish you luck
[0:36:42] <gustavozxd> @th3smartalec yeah I know it's so fucking cool!
[0:36:43] <+moranprime> Vergil is so fun to play in this game
[0:36:43] <iziwings> this is healing room as fuck with nero god damn
[0:36:48] <linkwolf4> woohoo party time! lytCRAZY
[0:36:48] <RenzoTheLion> has anyone in chat been counting the amount of lunar phases this stream?
[0:36:48] <deviljhojho94> I like how woolie is still a babby streamer and not as comfortable as the other guys
[0:36:50] <Josef_Stryker> I love how Vergil isn't even confirmed but we all know he's gonna be in DMCV
[0:36:52] <@mothmandraws> would vergil be cool if he was played by one of the kids from the kingdom hearts parking lot vid
[0:36:58] <+Eaglestrike117> NO MANS BRAIN CAN HANDLE WITNESSING 100 STYLE BEATS AT ONCE
[0:37:00] <nolifegamin> @thebestestkevin that's one of the reasons I did it, not waiting for Pat to get his shit together and play some Chaos Legion
[0:37:02] <WG101> @mothmandraws yes
[0:37:04] <neozz13> Chaos Legion isn’t what some would call good though
[0:37:04] <MettleWolf> Can't wait for Kiryu and Majima to join DMC5
[0:37:07] <traellium> @Josef_Stryker I love how you love that
[0:37:15] <gunstar73> It only be made better moth
[0:37:22] <ChineseNininga> 100 people doing judgement cut end at once
[0:37:23] <eggsnbakefest> I read that as "Would Vergil be cool if he was in Kingdome Hearts"
[0:37:23] <+Th3SmartAlec> Take a shot every time Vergil says "SCHUM"
[0:37:23] <nolifegamin> Idk there must be at least 5 Chaos Legion apologists in chat
[0:37:24] <jeecay> @mothmandraws only if his taunt is to call people nobodies
[0:37:27] <ConfusedCultist> I certanly remember not having a lot of fun with Chaos legion surely
[0:37:29] <joylent_blue> nice
[0:37:35] <deemans> vergil's overdriveis the coolest
[0:37:35] <iziwings> faust hurts so much in dmd dude
[0:37:36] <ConfusedCultist> But every game has its fandom I guess
[0:37:36] <+TsunamiPoro> kek
[0:37:40] <+Eaglestrike117> dont turn woolies stream into bardock level 3's at evo
[0:37:44] <Crankthulhu> Bloody Palace is 100 floors in 4, right?
[0:37:45] <deviljhojho94> even fallout 76 has its fans
[0:37:46] <InfiniteSwagbito> DO I HEAR THE HERESY OF CHAOS
[0:37:47] <Make_me_mad> I played way too much Chaos Legion. it was okay.
[0:37:49] <deviljhojho94> Not for long tho OMEGALUL
[0:37:50] <+Th3SmartAlec> I hate that ataack
[0:37:52] <bazz_tv> to be honest time has never been an issue with Bloody Palace in this game, you get so much time for doing a floor with a decent ranking and no damage that its never a factor
[0:37:53] <+moranprime> @nolifegamin V is gonna play like a better Sieg Warheit
[0:37:59] <GohanEgret> vergil's taunts should be replaced by spanish donte
[0:38:03] <FatDragonQuest> is it wrong that I want the glaives from DmC Vergils may Abort to come back
[0:38:05] <+TsunamiPoro> I want bayo 3 so bad though man
[0:38:07] <+moranprime> I'm calling it
[0:38:12] <RenzoTheLion> they better reveal V at the game awards or else
[0:38:17] <+Eaglestrike117> No its Vergil WILL abort
[0:38:18] <+Robopengy> Is that like coming in from the windows? How's it so bright in Montreal?
[0:38:19] <nolifegamin> @moranprime a lot of things could play like a better Sieg
[0:38:19] <+wsmccall> I don't think I'll ever get tired of Vergil saying SCUM
[0:38:20] <FairOnFire> I actually finished bloody palace for the first time recently
[0:38:20] <+Eaglestrike117> get it right
[0:38:21] <@mothmandraws> just give vergil meta knights spanish voice
[0:38:24] <joylent_blue> i love purposefully getting vergil hit with the mega-scarecrow blades, makes him look silly
[0:38:24] <deviljhojho94> La batalla final de donte y vergin is my favorite thing in the world
[0:38:30] <deviljhojho94> Just replace the entire soundtrack with guitarras
[0:38:32] <ConfusedCultist> or else we might need to wait for the actual game and get a surprise, wait, those dont happen much no more
[0:38:34] <+JayEarly> @FatDragonQuest I want them to come back too
[0:38:35] <+Th3SmartAlec> @RenzoTheLion Unsubscribe from Kamiya;s twitter
[0:38:35] <sangi53> @WoolieVersus when's the DmC "but who will take his place" gif a sub notification
[0:38:36] <Parapattern> Let's be honest with ourselves: those spinning blue summon swords look kinda dumb when Virgil's just standing there.
[0:38:37] <gunstar73> If bayo 3 comes out this year I’ll be surprised
[0:38:42] <+TsunamiPoro> get the devil juice
[0:38:42] <nolifegamin> man Vergil's voice is so fucking sick
[0:38:43] <+VVardy> Itsuno promised V something by the end of the year, so it should be at game awards
[0:38:43] <WG101> @deviljhojho94 that video is so good
[0:38:43] <neozz13> @fatdragonquest No, chakrams are a really cool weapon
[0:38:43] <Siregulus> look at all of these floating bugs
[0:38:44] <+SaltySkeleton12> @mothmandraws like his eng dub voice?
[0:38:44] <@mothmandraws> no para
[0:38:44] <TECHNO_OUTLAW> apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab apatWhat apatWhat apatLiz apatSmug
[0:38:46] <Crankthulhu> @RenzoTheLion They will, Itsuno said he'd reveal V before end of year and DMCV in confirmed to be at Game Awards
[0:38:48] <+Eaglestrike117> also @Robopengy those are cabinet doors, not windows
[0:38:48] <jeecay> Vergil = realistic Metaknight
[0:38:48] <+mr_falco_punch> never played the bloody palace challenge mode
[0:38:52] <@mothmandraws> shooting swords is better when you dont move
[0:38:52] <deviljhojho94> @WG101 My brother
[0:38:54] <+Eaglestrike117> so probably an actual light
[0:38:56] <mr_ESB> Bael\Dagon floor soon
[0:38:56] <@mothmandraws> hes basically gilgamesh from fate
[0:39:04] <FatDragonQuest> god dammit he is
[0:39:05] <eggsnbakefest> Fooleeshness, Kirrby, fooleeshness!
[0:39:06] <ConfusedCultist> Wait is that true moth?
[0:39:07] <deviljhojho94> But sexier
[0:39:07] <+Th3SmartAlec> That looked sweet
[0:39:07] <@Commando_Joe> no one likes fate Moth
[0:39:09] <+WindUpEstinien> everyone ready for a live version of Devil Trigger at the VGA
[0:39:09] <+JayEarly> SCHUM
[0:39:09] <@Commando_Joe> Stop talking about it
[0:39:10] <TheFilth> I really wonder how V will play
[0:39:10] <+Eaglestrike117> Moth
[0:39:13] <@mothmandraws> NO I WILL
[0:39:14] <+Hilleltaco> I'm excited to probably see Bayo 3 at the game awards. It's been almost exactly a year since we first saw it
[0:39:14] <+TsunamiPoro> Fate is bad dont @ me
[0:39:17] <+Robopengy> @Eaglestrike117 Woolie trapped the sun in his cabinet!?
[0:39:17] <+Eaglestrike117> MOTH
[0:39:18] <FatDragonQuest> I DO JOE
[0:39:19] <+SaltySkeleton12> Joe
[0:39:21] <gyrobasel> big sip
[0:39:22] <@mothmandraws> fate is best ill fight you all
[0:39:23] <Downcom1ng> Stay hydrated chat!
[0:39:25] <+Eaglestrike117> HE'S MORE LIKE EMIYA AND YOU KNOW IT
[0:39:25] <iziwings> is turbo mode on
[0:39:26] <deviljhojho94> Fate is that one thing that I see everyone talking about but have never seen someone in real life that likes it
[0:39:27] <@Commando_Joe> even the people that say they like fate don't like it
[0:39:29] <@Commando_Joe> they just hate themselves
[0:39:31] <optosi> I hope if Vergil's in 5 the voice actor deliberately caught a cold to voice him
[0:39:33] <Kristoffers> oh what, did I catch a second dmc4 let's play?
[0:39:34] <WG101> i don't even know what the fuck fate is
[0:39:35] <+dodge_and_dust> Fate is fine
[0:39:35] <gustavozxd> isn't fate that one badly drawn hentai?
[0:39:36] <@mothmandraws> thats true joe
[0:39:37] <+Hilleltaco> Summon swords solve so many enemies
[0:39:39] <TheMilhouseExperience> Sip Sip. Now I'm motivated.
[0:39:40] <DustySolenth> I with you moth, but he's closer to Emiya than Gil
[0:39:40] <+Vivaciousx3> I want to see some more just judgement cuts!
[0:39:41] <FatDragonQuest> Fate is just historical wrestlemania fuckin don't @ me
[0:39:41] <ConfusedCultist> oh no moth is a fate fan
[0:39:42] <deviljhojho94> @Commando_Joe Can't believe how accurate that is hotdamn
[0:39:44] <+Eaglestrike117> YOU KNOW ITS MORE LIKE HOW EMIYA DOES IT MOTH
[0:39:44] <mr_ESB> So excited for training mode in 5
[0:39:46] <joylent_blue> niceee
[0:39:49] <supersanic94> MISTA WOOLS!
[0:39:50] <bazz_tv> fun fact Vergil's voice is also the red ranger from Time Force
[0:39:50] <WG101> i've seen a summary of it, and yet i still don't know what it is
[0:39:51] <MettleWolf> @mothmandraws who's your waifu in Fate?
[0:39:59] <+TsunamiPoro> Mista is best passione boy
[0:40:01] <iziwings> it looks like it's on
[0:40:01] <+kraftium> fate zero is the best thing to come out of fate ... solid 7.5/10
[0:40:01] <neozz13> @mothmandraws Who’s your favourite Fate. Illya?
[0:40:03] <+Eaglestrike117> No the quantam ranger
[0:40:04] <eggsnbakefest> "You can only voice Vergil while you have a cold. As soon as you've recovered, get out."
[0:40:05] <gunstar73> Only good thing about fate is Gilgamesh and the chariot in season 1 fuck saber trash ass waifu
[0:40:07] <WG101> @TsunamiPoro DAMN FUCKING STRAIGHT
[0:40:10] <DustySolenth> He makes the swords instead of pulling them from a portal
[0:40:10] <+Eaglestrike117> Vergil is the quantam ranger
[0:40:11] <@mothmandraws> best og fate girl is medusa
[0:40:11] <+Th3SmartAlec> Whiffed
[0:40:14] <FatDragonQuest> @bazz_tv You're sorta right? he's actually the better red ranger
[0:40:17] <gustavozxd> Vergil's voice actor does the mocap for credo
[0:40:18] <+mr_falco_punch> i'm so hyped for dmcv
[0:40:20] <+moranprime> @WindUpEstinien But are we all ready for the live performance of Subhuman Kappa Kappa
[0:40:23] <@mothmandraws> extended universe is either musashi or mordred
[0:40:26] <+Th3SmartAlec> No sell
[0:40:30] <deviljhojho94> my favorite fate girl is the one in that one unsavory manga i read that one time
[0:40:30] <Nomad_Scholar> Any hopes of Capcom fixing Dante's theme for 5?
[0:40:31] <+WindUpEstinien> @moranprime Don't do this.
[0:40:32] <neozz13> @mothmandraws *Medea
[0:40:35] <deviljhojho94> The one with white hair
[0:40:37] <gyrobasel> that's broken as fuck lmao
[0:40:38] <bazz_tv> and Nero was the second black ranger in Migthy Morphing POwer Rangersa
[0:40:44] <+Th3SmartAlec> @moranprime COULD YOU IMAGINE
[0:40:45] <iziwings> lame it out
[0:40:47] <+JayEarly> is it me or was that Faust moving in slo-mo?
[0:40:47] <laphyrion> @mothmandraws For me it's either her or OG Alter.
[0:40:50] <@mothmandraws> medea is someone elses housewife
[0:40:50] <DustySolenth> @mothmandraws How could someone be so confident yet so wrong
[0:40:51] <Prism_Wing> @moranprime I was born ready
[0:41:02] <+TsunamiPoro> Also I would just like to appreciate the part 5 anime going from gay undertones to BIG GAY OVERTONES
[0:41:03] <@mothmandraws> dont ruin her happiness
[0:41:03] <neozz13> @mothmandraws Y u no ntr
[0:41:07] <GohanEgret> if woolie doesn't make it, he has to listen to subhuman on stream Kappa
[0:41:08] <+moranprime> What's that hand gesture that the guy does in that video lmao
[0:41:08] <InfiniteSwagbito> That akihiko gif seems a bit wonky
[0:41:10] <RenzoTheLion> its always interesting to watch other people play this game to see what their habits are
[0:41:10] <+Th3SmartAlec> @JayEarly Could be the stream. Some moves make the enemies move slow for effect
[0:41:11] <+Eaglestrike117> He all wish we could say medea, but she's taken
[0:41:14] <alrobot2014> how are you supposed to dodge the mephisto's beyblade attack
[0:41:14] <+SaltySkeleton12> Did moth start a fate waifu war
[0:41:20] <FatDragonQuest> Nero claudius is my favorite fate girl and cu is my favorite fate boy I hope they're having a Good Day
[0:41:21] <+Eaglestrike117> also medusa is a biker girl and THOSE ARE THE BEST

[0:44:03] <+mr_falco_punch> 101 lvls geez
[0:44:05] <badmr7> @WoolieVersus sword rain is good to pin those blitzes down
[0:44:07] <neozz13> @woolieversus Shoryu distort blitzes
[0:44:07] <+moranprime> I want Bullet Ride by In Flames to be Dante's new theme in DMCV.
[0:44:08] <ConfusedCultist> If he gets an S he can listen to Vmills subhuman

[0:44:22] <+lozscat> YOU GOT IT
[0:44:22] <+libra_zero> I'm taking Latin in college right now, so all I'm seeing when "mortis" appears is "of death" or "death's"

[0:44:46] <+unbARECKable> If you were wasting our time why would we be here lol?
[0:44:46] <Supabait> @WoolieVersus doesnt super nero have max-acts on every attack in this game?
[0:44:48] <iziwings> i only really just frame judgement cut off of roulette
[0:44:53] <gunstar73> Big waste for big bois
[0:44:53] <Crazytalk27> try dann it

[0:44:57] <gustavozxd> don't worry we don't think you're a fake fan at all Kappa
[0:44:57] <+Eaglestrike117> yes, yes he does
[0:45:01] <+Eaglestrike117> Super nero is BUSTED
[0:45:02] <+JustSayAnything> Can't wait to see him fight the two blitzs at once.
[0:45:02] <InfiniteSwagbito> THESE GUYS DON'T ATTACK?
[0:45:03] <OwlLightningMage> No more Subhuman. Chat has suffered Subhuman enough on the podcast BibleThump
[0:45:03] <@mothmandraws> pacifist run
[0:45:04] <InfiniteSwagbito> I HAD NO IDEA
[0:45:06] <CaptainKarite> They don't want any
[0:45:07] <GohanEgret> NO BOOLI
[0:45:08] <joker_joestar> Yup
[0:45:08] <iziwings> what's that one multiple judgement cut tech
[0:45:10] <+RaidenZal> They don't realize they're not on camera.
[0:45:11] <+Eaglestrike117> Max act AND INFINITE DT ALL DAY
[0:45:12] <neozz13> @alrobot2014 Dmd
[0:45:12] <InfiniteSwagbito> I JUST KILL THEM SO FAST I NEVER NOTICED LOL
[0:45:13] <+Menitta> huh. didnt know that
[0:45:16] <gustavozxd> man I hate scarecrows tho
[0:45:19] <+RaidenZal> Or rather, that they are on. :V
[0:45:25] <+WindUpEstinien> they're just trying to live :(
[0:45:29] <WG101> that fucking strut
[0:45:32] <+Menitta> show us instant Judgment cuts!
[0:45:32] <+lozscat> Wait i got a question, is more time good or bad?
[0:45:35] <deviljhojho94> we are all scarecrows now
[0:45:38] <eggsnbakefest> I feel like this game is to the point where it's like "why would you play as anyone other than Vergil of Nero"
[0:45:42] <+vampirate1> @WoolieVersus I got motivated by you and pat playing. Bought this game and beat it on easy. Gonna try for a normal run after school's done.
[0:45:45] <mr_ESB> Doesnt vergil have his own theme in 4?
[0:45:46] <gunstar73> More time is good
[0:45:50] <joylent_blue> max-act streak spam is wayyy too fun
[0:45:54] <InfiniteSwagbito> @mr_ESB Sadly, no
[0:45:55] <+Rathalos2006> You say they're doing nothing, but really they're taunting you. You have no idea how much their Style meters reached just there :p
[0:45:57] <+moranprime> @mr_ESB Just in his intro video
[0:45:58] <neozz13> I hate the infinity max act Nero. I much preferred the one from vanilla DMC4
[0:45:59] <joker_joestar> More time is obviously good
[0:45:59] <MarylandJutsu> bang bang
[0:46:00] <+Eaglestrike117> why did you play DMC on easy
[0:46:01] <mr_ESB> Awwww
[0:46:02] <ConfusedCultist> Vergil needs to sacrifice Nero for more time on the clock
[0:46:02] <WG101> OOH BOY
[0:46:09] <MettleWolf> Kinda miss the dumb SAVAGE, SADISTIC, SENSATIONAL
[0:46:11] <+Hilleltaco> @mr_ESB There's a remix but it's nowhere in gameplay
[0:46:13] <gunstar73> Pretty much shit ends when time runs out or woolie dies
[0:46:14] <bazz_tv> imo splits is the easiest to Max-act out of Nero's slashes
[0:46:14] <WG101> @ConfusedCultist take his arm
[0:46:15] <InfiniteSwagbito> Vergil gets meter back super quick so it's fine
[0:46:17] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah Vergil on DT is wacky af
[0:46:19] <joylent_blue> ITS NOT A WASTE IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD
[0:46:20] <AdiXeR3> SSSENSATIONAL
[0:46:21] <+dodge_and_dust> if you ever want to practice JFJC i recommend aiming for it on the second swing
[0:46:29] <Dualities> Meter's never wasted if it looks FUCKIN COOL
[0:46:31] <ConfusedCultist> @WG101 thats how DMC5 happened
[0:46:32] <rosabellamelantha> @eggsnbakefest because once you get even above average by Dante you're more stylish than every other character in the game combined with the tech you can do
[0:46:33] <gustavozxd> Dino's combat screams LUL
[0:46:39] <Evendrag> wanna sub, but cant
[0:46:46] <Sol_Install> this ice demons
[0:46:48] <WG101> @ConfusedCultist he was doing bloody palace back at 4 and needed more time
[0:46:54] <gustavozxd> at the end of DmC his screams get even funnier though
[0:46:56] <Siregulus> NOT MOTIVATED ENOUGH lytBADMAN
[0:46:58] <denam_of_windscale> @gustavozxd UHHHHH?! AHHHHH!!!
[0:47:00] <ConfusedCultist> Gustavo you mean his combat barks?
[0:47:08] <+moranprime> Man, I hope they bring back Frosts in DMCV since it's like a contest of demons.
[0:47:08] <bazz_tv> talking about DIno, hey @WoolieVersus are you going to play Vorgil's downfall in the LP?
[0:47:09] <+JayEarly> Frost: "Might as well just die"
[0:47:09] <WG101> THE FUCK IS A SHEILD?
[0:47:13] <eggsnbakefest> Sheesh, fair enough. I only just got to Dante, not a fan compared to Nero or Vergil
[0:47:14] <AlasterAngelo> yeah but if Vergil DMC4SE happens before DMC3 how does Virgil have Beowulf huh?
[0:47:16] <WG101> shield*
[0:47:18] <+lozscat> FUCK A SHIELD
[0:47:24] <Guntanks_in_Space> oh man @gustavozxd i can never get over UEEEEEEEEEEEEH AAAAAAAAAAAH :<
[0:47:25] <InfiniteSwagbito> @dodge_and_dust For whatever reason I got the timing down for JFJC for only a few moves. Mainly the first swing so I can spam it from any range, and the vertical spin move he does in the air into it
[0:47:25] <+Ssaik> Kick-13 can just wail into the shield
[0:47:30] <+Ssaik> it's nice
[0:47:37] <Fourson> yeah, kcik 13 breaks shields
[0:47:38] <alrobot2014> lunar phase is my best friend
[0:47:46] <neozz13> @eggsnbakefest Sure, but you just shittalked the best character in the game
[0:47:46] <InfiniteSwagbito> Kick 13 breaks shields? Huh
[0:47:46] <joylent_blue> ooooof
[0:47:47] <+RaidenZal> I find even rapid slash spamming doesn't work against the shield dudes on LDK (at least in my experience :V ) because there's just *so many of them*
[0:47:53] <gunstar73> Is it Bianco or Blanco
[0:47:54] <rosabellamelantha> Alternatively Pandora release and break their shields instantly
[0:47:57] <Rincewind1998> First time here, I love the sub notification animations/text
[0:47:59] <WG101> FUCK THESE BIRDS
[0:47:59] <InfiniteSwagbito> I usually just spammed the katana rush
[0:48:01] <iziwings> iirc doesn't the back forward swords like freeze them in place basically for big shoryu reppa setups
[0:48:01] <+RaidenZal> But I'm also a style baby with Vergil still, so.
[0:48:02] <bazz_tv> bianco
[0:48:02] <RenzoTheLion> JFJC on the first swing is so fun
[0:48:02] <+Hilleltaco> I hear Vergil gets extra Trick stuff in DT, but I never really learned to use it because whenever I'm in DT I'm doing something dumb like infinite rapid slash
[0:48:03] <Dualities> lunar phase triggers UMvC3 flashbacks
[0:48:09] <joker_joestar> Woolie jump cancel lunar phase into divekick pls
[0:48:11] <+johnny_gogo> YEEEEEEEEE
[0:48:12] <+dodge_and_dust> @InfiniteSwagbito yeah. the delayed aerial combo i like the best place to get it down cause you can launch an enemy into a group that way then hit them all
[0:48:14] <+Vivaciousx3> jfjc makes them tolerable
[0:48:15] <SixthSun2> PogChamp
[0:48:18] <Supabait> PogChamp
[0:48:18] <eggsnbakefest> Who, Dante? I mean, I just like playing as Nero and Vergil more. I never said Dante was bad
[0:48:18] <+SuichiTanaka> Siiiiiiiiiick
[0:48:19] <bazz_tv> Bianco is italian for white
[0:48:21] <ConfusedCultist> deleted
[0:48:25] <Guntanks_in_Space> they actually took Lunar Phase busted-ness in mind with carrying it over to DMC4
[0:48:25] <MettleWolf> WOOLIE'S SOOOOOO COOL
[0:48:25] <joylent_blue> FUCK its so cool
[0:48:26] <awesomeguyrequiem> Judgement Cut YEET
[0:48:32] <+wreativecriting> man that's a Problem Solver
[0:48:33] <InfiniteSwagbito> @dodge_and_dust Great so I'm not crazy, it's been fun and useful
[0:48:42] <0rond> @WoolieVersus what's your favorite kirby color in amazing mirror? i like the blue and the orange/pink ones personally
[0:48:49] <BaronVonWidget> lytCRAZY
[0:48:51] <gustavozxd> @guntanks_in_space I never reaaally noticed it until Pat pointed them out, in game at least, but in the last 2 missions they start using those exact same sounds in the cutscenes and it's really funny
[0:48:52] <+JayEarly> Vergil is anime
[0:48:54] <+lozscat> flex on em
[0:48:57] <Siregulus> GET THAT STYLE IN lytCRAZY
[0:48:58] <WG101> yo did he just walk up slowly and flash kick?
[0:49:00] <AlasterAngelo> Vergil is easily the most busted of the DMC4 characters
[0:49:01] <+moranprime> @0rond Blood Kirby Kappa
[0:49:02] <MettleWolf> Just give me Devil May Cry 5. I need my expectations exceeded.
[0:49:03] <+WindUpEstinien> when's the vergil anime
[0:49:08] <SixthSun2> LUL
[0:49:08] <ConfusedCultist> Judgement cut is a better version of "fuck everything in this general direction"
[0:49:11] <+johnny_gogo> I love how vergil is just a boss character
[0:49:16] <joylent_blue> LUL
[0:49:17] <iziwings> yeah that scarecrow was so sick
[0:49:17] <nnif> Dante is cooler :)
[0:49:18] <alrobot2014> that scarecrow was pretty cool
[0:49:18] <jeecay> LOL
[0:49:19] <CaptainKarite> LUL
[0:49:20] <Sleepology> and then you look at DMC NotLikeThis
[0:49:22] <iziwings> dodged the whole thing
[0:49:22] <deviljhojho94> LOOK AT THAT YOU FUCKS
[0:49:23] <+dodge_and_dust> probably cause Dante can stop time
[0:49:24] <blackorchidKI2> Vergil Appreciation Day is EVERY DAY
[0:49:24] <OwlLightningMage> He needs to shoot more babies to be cool Kappa
[0:49:25] <+JayEarly> @Siregulus where's that emote from?
[0:49:26] <Who_lio42> Vergils ok i guess
[0:49:27] <Theonlypegsus> WOOLIE SPLUDGING ON STREAM
[0:49:27] <Guntanks_in_Space> gustavo i played that game like back in 2013, i can never ever get over spamming stomp and all the dumb yells he does, especially when the fireworks float glitch wasn't fixed yet
[0:49:28] <neozz13> DT Woolie and do side dodges and back jumps while locking on
[0:49:28] <gunstar73> Big mark
[0:49:29] <jeecay> THE GREATEST HENCHMEN
[0:49:29] <+moranprime> Even when Vergil is Gilver from the original novelization, he's cool AF.
[0:49:29] <+mister_rogers> dmc4 shows how much work they put into their characters in UMVC3
[0:49:31] <Siregulus> @JayEarly lythero
[0:49:31] <+VVardy> I always found Nero cooler, and Dante coolest
[0:49:33] <bazz_tv> when Vergil flexes his sumond swords are around him because those are his guns
[0:49:33] <+novanazo> vergil is always cool
[0:49:35] <TyrantAlexandria> I'm So Glad All That's Happening on This is Getting Hyped about Vergil Every Few Seconds
[0:49:35] <+cvp5127> SPLOOSH
[0:49:36] <Jeter98> he ain't t cool because you missed that one guy
[0:49:37] <RenzoTheLion> the real test is JFJC from Force Edge Combo B
[0:49:38] <blackorchidKI2> I actually... kind of like DMC Vergil's outfit.. just a teeny bit more...
[0:49:39] <0rond> my power shall be absolute... except for that one scarecrow in particular
[0:49:45] <Downcom1ng> Fuckin bless Vergil
[0:49:46] <denam_of_windscale> there are people out there who don't think vergil is dope as fuck?
[0:49:46] <blackorchidKI2> I am ready for your rage.
[0:49:52] <AlasterAngelo> Woolie's such a Vergil stan I'm surprised he didn't try to like Virgin from DmC
[0:49:53] <joylent_blue> WOW
[0:49:55] <+lozscat> At least it's not GIANT FIST
[0:49:55] <joylent_blue> RUDE
[0:49:56] <+dodge_and_dust> wow. that was a fast attack
[0:50:00] <bleugh> you keep missing the no damage bonus Kappa
[0:50:06] <gunstar73> Only reason I like Vergil more is cuz he’s blue like Dante’s personality more tho
[0:50:10] <Siregulus> lytCRAZY lytCRAZY lytCRAZY lytCRAZY lytCRAZY lytCRAZY lytCRAZY lytCRAZY lytCRAZY lytCRAZY lytCRAZY
[0:50:13] <WG101> MILLION STABS
[0:50:16] <gustavozxd> @guntanks_in_space yeah yeah the stomp was the one move that felt off the most, and the exact scream from the stomp is what they use in the vergil fight
[0:50:21] <TheArrow_> I counted ,that was actually a million
[0:50:23] <+Solidnick18> Yeee
[0:50:31] <NYCrownlessKing> will vergil be ruined for you in dmc5 if he gets a really weird face? @WoolieVersus
[0:50:32] <AdiXeR3> DmC's Vergil has cooler coat, though
[0:50:37] <InfiniteSwagbito> @Sleepology I won't defend DmC much but I will say that Vergil, regardless of his body/personality, had a stylish cloak/jacket
[0:50:42] <ConfusedCultist> disagree
[0:50:44] <+lozscat> yeyey
[0:50:45] <+moranprime> I like his "This place shall be your grave!" taunt
[0:50:45] <bazz_tv> Sooo.. SCHUUMM
[0:50:52] <+bonzosan> I love how woolie marks out every other room
[0:50:52] <Sleepology> cool jackets do not make the man !
[0:50:54] <+Hilleltaco> If you get hit by Mega Scarecrow's death blade while taunting, you should die instantly
[0:50:56] <joylent_blue> i NEVER get tired of rapid slash spam
[0:50:56] <+dodge_and_dust> SO overkill
[0:51:03] <neozz13> @infiniteswagbito That’s because it was a concept from DMC1 for Vergil
[0:51:20] <InfiniteSwagbito> @neozz13 Really? Didn't know that. Cool.
[0:51:21] <ConfusedCultist> vergil is so fucking cool
[0:51:30] <MettleWolf> Wonder what Ninja Theory said about Vergil. Is he too a gay cowboy?
[0:51:31] <WG101> FUCK YOUR SHIELD
[0:51:32] <AlasterAngelo> Virgin didn't have a cooler anything Vergil's got a cool golden hemmed coat and an armored vest
[0:51:33] <+VVardy> I hate how Faust if he's real elevated when his cloak is broken then he gets his cloak back
[0:51:34] <Downcom1ng> I like DmC Vergil's coat but that armband needed to go imo
[0:51:34] <Guntanks_in_Space> Woolie can you parry the angelo orb
[0:51:39] <bleugh> if dmcv is consistent with 3, they should just copy paste dante's face for vergil...
[0:51:40] <joylent_blue> can we get a "vergil is fucking cool" counter
[0:51:41] <deviljhojho94> crikMigel christ
[0:51:41] <WG101> @MettleWolf no, he's a gay samurai
[0:51:44] <spardanwarrior> Just got here, what'd I miss?
[0:51:45] <Guntanks_in_Space> don't even let them do angelo orb when you're vergil, too stronk!
[0:51:53] <+mister_rogers> vergil has best oki
[0:51:58] <+WindUpEstinien> #fuckyourshield
[0:52:00] <+lozscat> DROP YOUR SHIELD
[0:52:07] <ConfusedCultist> DROP IT
[0:52:08] <SixthSun2> That animation wasn't transparent
[0:52:09] <CadmiumCore> I love playing vergil in DMC4se, but god does it wreck my hand
[0:52:13] <InfiniteSwagbito> @bleugh Yeah I always wondered about that in DMC4. Vergil's face is... idk, thinner? Than Dante
[0:52:17] <FatDragonQuest> yeah I'm not a fan of force edge
[0:52:26] <Supabait> air stinger PogChamp
[0:52:28] <RenzoTheLion> but Force Edge Combo B is so good tho
[0:52:30] <+Vivaciousx3> his round trip is so good tho
[0:52:31] <ConfusedCultist> huh, I actually like force edge a lot
[0:52:31] <+HiroTSK5> shame, force edge is my favorite
[0:52:32] <iziwings> vergil's round trip is crazy
[0:52:33] <InfiniteSwagbito> Force Edge works great for me with that really long combo
[0:52:33] <neozz13> @woolieversus both distortions are the same. You also don’t press it just once, you press it multiple times
[0:52:34] <bazz_tv> second attempt at bloody palace @spardanwarrior
[0:52:37] <joylent_blue> round trip is good for crowd vacuum work
[0:52:39] <gustavozxd> DmC Vergil's hair looked ok too, but then for some reason they changed it in the dlc and it looks awful, I know he's supposed to look pathetic but damn
[0:52:40] <deemans> Force Edge Combo B is SICK
[0:52:42] <ConfusedCultist> its the objectively worst weapon but its so cool!
[0:52:42] <johnnyortiz_> Super serious Vergil is best Vergil. These are not CUH-RAZY times Dante!
[0:52:44] <AlasterAngelo> Vergil here is also younger than DMC4 Dante maybe that's why @InfiniteSwagbito
[0:52:46] <gunstar73> Is force edge just rebellion
[0:52:49] <WG101> FUCK YOUR STUPID SHIELDS, I DON'T GIVE A FUCK
[0:52:50] <Graxe_> I actually prefer Force Edge and Yamato in 3SE than just Force Edge in 4SE.
[0:52:57] <bazz_tv> first attempt got to floor 37
[0:52:59] <+dodge_and_dust> force edge is worth a slot just for fulll concentration round trip
[0:53:01] <Graxe_> Air Stinger's cool, though.
[0:53:06] <WG101> GUARD BREAK, MOTHERFUCKER
[0:53:09] <+lozscat> DROP SHIELD
[0:53:12] <Siregulus> NOT SAFE ON SHIELD, SHITHEAD
[0:53:13] <+QueequegTheater> Rebellion and Force Edge are distinct different swords @gunstar73
[0:53:13] <Siregulus> lytCRAZY
[0:53:16] <ConfusedCultist> Gunstar no force edge is a dual blade cause it combos with yamato and it has some different moves from rebellion
[0:53:21] <+HiroTSK5> where all my runs end
[0:53:22] <eggsnbakefest> Imagine if Vergil was allowed in MvCI
[0:53:25] <RenzoTheLion> L U N A R P H A S E
[0:53:25] <Volta_Bass> Now I'm motivated
[0:53:26] <+moranprime> I can't wait for corrupted Vergil to be a thing. Hopefully we get a Gilver costume as an unlockable if they make Vergil playable.
[0:53:26] <ConfusedCultist> Also its the sword "daddy" used
[0:53:27] <InfiniteSwagbito> I usually just max concentration DRT Blitz. Not sure why woolie doesn't go for it, it's an instakill
[0:53:32] <gunstar73> Ok move set l
[0:53:32] <Guntanks_in_Space> full concentration round trip into the SSS taunt with the spinny summoned sword is so good
[0:53:34] <TheMilhouseExperience> Force edge is ridiculous with that air stinger.
[0:53:35] <bazz_tv> but he was blocking that!!! buggy sons of sparda mechanics
[0:53:40] <mr_ESB> Woolie gripping the controller in claw style
[0:53:40] <+askalta> lucky
[0:53:41] <+VVardy> Wow that was a weird Blitz
[0:53:43] <gunstar73> Just remind me of it
[0:53:45] <mr_ESB> ?
[0:53:46] <Guntanks_in_Space> i'm still bummed that they didn't call the Vergil mechanic the MOTIVATION gauge
[0:53:46] <+QueequegTheater> Holy shit this is like a Vergil clinic @WoolieVersus
[0:53:48] <joylent_blue> i would've LOVED to see shitty vergil in MvCI LUL
[0:53:49] <+dodge_and_dust> that Blitz was not well
[0:53:50] <TheArrow_> that guy just accepted it
[0:53:51] <neozz13> How do you play a super character and not just DT the entire time
[0:54:00] <iziwings> that wasn't his best performance
[0:54:03] <InfiniteSwagbito> That Blitz just sat there like "This is fine"
[0:54:10] <Rincewind1998> Then why'd he get beat by Dante?
[0:54:10] <ConfusedCultist> FUCK DOSE DOGGOS
[0:54:17] <+JayEarly> YOU ARE NOT WORTHY AS MY OPPONENT
[0:54:19] <+dodge_and_dust> i would ahve saved cut end for Berial. fuck Berial
[0:54:21] <bazz_tv> you wasted DT on the doggos
[0:54:22] <TheMilhouseExperience> *was* absolute.
[0:54:24] <cervidaequus> But woolie, when you surpass brennan, who will sit in his place? :O
[0:54:25] <metabot64> Wow its just basically UMVC3
[0:54:31] <ConfusedCultist> Yes
[0:54:37] <InfiniteSwagbito> For whatever reason I always have a lot of trouble against Berial as vergil
[0:54:37] <joylent_blue> wtfff
[0:54:40] <Piejumper5814> pup snuffers inc doing well i see
[0:54:42] <iziwings> this game's so sick that i only just noticed the mouse cursor
[0:54:42] <gustavozxd> ooohh god I hate that move so much
[0:54:43] <jeecay> If only he could loves something. Then his power would be absolute....
[0:54:50] <+dodge_and_dust> @InfiniteSwagbito same
[0:54:51] <ConfusedCultist> Bork breakers Vergil is one of them
[0:54:58] <InfiniteSwagbito> Woolie is fucking shredding him though
[0:54:59] <Guntanks_in_Space> in essence, DMC4SE Vergil is 3 Vergil + UMVC3 Vergil + bits of DmC Vergin's cool shit
[0:54:59] <InfiniteSwagbito> damn
[0:55:00] <Downcom1ng> Damn I didn't notice the cursor either
[0:55:02] <+johnny_gogo> @WoolieVersus Your mic is a little quiet
[0:55:05] <ConfusedCultist> Seriously tho I cant stand Berial's AoR
[0:55:07] <eggsnbakefest> *Vergil slow walks up to Berial, adjusts his collar* "This may be fun"
[0:55:08] <ConfusedCultist> AoE*
[0:55:09] <joylent_blue> nice
[0:55:11] <joker_joestar> FINALLY some JCs
[0:55:13] <bignerb> holy shit that cursor tho
[0:55:14] <InfiniteSwagbito> I thought my screen broke
[0:55:18] <bignerb> just saw it lol
[0:55:21] <+Hilleltaco> PogChamp
[0:55:21] <Who_lio42> Vergils p strong for a guy who dies
[0:55:27] <Graxe_> I just realized the other day that Dante actually can't do a proper Judgment Cut. He just does what he thinks Vergil did and it sorta works, but he can't focus all the cuts onto a single enemy like how Vergil can so he spreads them out.
[0:55:31] <neozz13> @woolieversus to get away quickly with Vergil, DT and while locked on press x in any direction and even in the air
[0:55:32] <+QueequegTheater> I bet it wouldn't happen on an X-b-Zone-X
[0:55:33] <DrFacilier> So fast the computer couldnt handle it
[0:55:34] <+libra_zero> Vergil's too powerful for the computer to handle
[0:55:37] <MettleWolf> Take that Berial, your dad was a shit.
[0:55:37] <InfiniteSwagbito> WOOLIE YOUR CURSOR IS ON SCREEN
[0:55:38] <gustavozxd> so I hate cutscenes in the middle of boss fights, and I was worried dmc5 would have them, but so far I've seen nothing and that first boss even has a stage transition without cutscenes, good.
[0:55:46] <joylent_blue> oh shit cursor
[0:55:46] <WG101> @libra_zero the pc needs to get motivated
[0:55:47] <mr_ESB> Cant wait for Credos floor PogChamp
[0:55:49] <+QueequegTheater> CURSOR
[0:55:55] <gunstar73> No one tell him
[0:55:56] <+askalta> I didnt even notice it
[0:55:57] <Guntanks_in_Space> @Graxe_ yeah neat detail that one is! Dante goes ham with the Yamato, while Vergil's always so precise
[0:55:59] <ConfusedCultist> That cursor needs a cardboard box its not properly hidden!
[0:56:02] <Siregulus> mouse%
[0:56:04] <+lozscat> CURSOR
[0:56:05] <gustavozxd> fighting credo as vergil is kinda weird tho
[0:56:06] <Siregulus> bloody palace speedrun
[0:56:06] <denam_of_windscale> oh shit i just noticed the cursor can't unsee
[0:56:08] <joylent_blue> the cursor thinks vergil is cool too
[0:56:09] <AlasterAngelo> I always wondered why Dante never did magic bullshit like Vergil's swords
[0:56:10] <bazz_tv> "so shcumm"
[0:56:10] <+lozscat> MOUSE
[0:56:14] <itemmerchant> When is Woolie buying his full size metal Beowulf replica
[0:56:15] <ConfusedCultist> !
[0:56:15] <AlisaBoss> m o u s e
[0:56:16] <AlasterAngelo> Dante makes Summoned Pizzas
[0:56:23] <+cvp5127> IMMERSION RUINED
[0:56:23] <+moranprime> LUL
[0:56:24] <Metalchaosmaster> I still suck with vergil. after se came out I still stuck with Nero and Dante
[0:56:29] <+Solidnick18> apatBlep
[0:56:30] <InfiniteSwagbito> CURSOR RESOLVED, RESUME SSS RANK
[0:56:33] <Supabait> just frame judgement cut is when you release it the frame it finishes charging right?
[0:56:37] <+Eaglestrike117> To be fair, dante literally picked up the sword for like 10 minutes
[0:56:40] <InfiniteSwagbito> @Supabait YES.
[0:56:40] <neozz13> Summoned Swords are not Yamato, it’s Vergil
[0:56:42] <@SoushinSen> What's cooking?
[0:56:44] <Siregulus> LET'S KEEP IT SSSENSATIONAL lytCRAZY
[0:56:46] <bignerb> NO i loved that cursor
[0:56:51] <Guntanks_in_Space> @SoushinSen bimmy!
[0:56:51] <+Eaglestrike117> oh hey billeh
[0:56:58] <ConfusedCultist> Cursor was the mascot
[0:57:01] <bazz_tv> cursor on screen, Dongurri has stopped watching the stream
[0:57:04] <+cvp5127> cursor chan
[0:57:07] <Bennett_Fracture> what's hood...
[0:57:08] <Downcom1ng> Woolie's cursor just wanted a front row seat for the show
[0:57:08] <ConfusedCultist> Yes
[0:57:11] <Shiranui24> oh i might have to dip out to watch kingdom hearts. is that tonight?
[0:57:11] <joylent_blue> THOSE who-
[0:57:22] <ConfusedCultist> Shiranui i think so
[0:57:24] <InfiniteSwagbito> @SoushinSen Currently circlejerking vergil and I refuse to stop
[0:57:26] <NYCrownlessKing> ? @Shiranui24
[0:57:27] <Rincewind1998> I like to think Summon Swords are a devil arm from some demon Vergil merc'd before DMC3 ever happened.
[0:57:29] <+dodge_and_dust> fuk that attack
[0:57:31] <+lozscat> you got it woolz
[0:57:38] <joylent_blue> fuck projectiles in this game
[0:57:39] <+lozscat> DO COMBO!
[0:57:39] <+VVardy> The Frosts get super mean as BP progresses
[0:57:41] <candidateplays> The Summoned Swords are summoned Force edges,
[0:57:45] <NYCrownlessKing> whats tonight?
[0:57:47] <+moranprime> Assault used dig!
[0:57:48] <neozz13> @rincewind1998 Nero has it too though
[0:57:49] <AlasterAngelo> i like how Dan Southworth is literally just Vergil
[0:57:52] <gigiaten> @WoolieVersus You should do the full Yamato cambo during DT cause the finishing attack is devastating
[0:57:55] <alrobot2014> but chimera assualts tho :(
[0:57:59] <+Eaglestrike117> no he isnt
[0:58:06] <InfiniteSwagbito> @VVardy I usually just Judgement Cut End the instant I see a squad of Frosts lol. I'm not dealing with that shit
[0:58:06] <gustavozxd> Assaults worst move is the shot because you can barely see it when they do it
[0:58:08] <bazz_tv> @AlasterAngelo and Reuben is just Dante
[0:58:09] <joylent_blue> Dan Southworth is way to dorky and likeable
[0:58:11] <+Eaglestrike117> Ironically, Dan acts more like dante outside of work
[0:58:14] <+JayEarly> @SoushinSen I'll tell ya what's cookin: M O T I V A T I O N
[0:58:15] <ConfusedCultist> See Woolie would have been getting no dmg bonuses if only he would do combo
[0:58:25] <Rincewind1998> @neozz13 only once he get's vergil's spirit DT thing though.
[0:58:28] <Guntanks_in_Space> Dan Southworth, the man who can style on his co-stars with a WET POOL NOODLE
[0:58:32] <+lozscat> B A D D O G G O
[0:58:34] <@SoushinSen> @JayEarly I M A G I N A T I O N
[0:58:42] <+Eaglestrike117> Like ironically Reuban is the more business like of the two, dan fucks around way too much
[0:58:47] <+Eaglestrike117> its great
[0:58:49] <mr_ESB> Trying to learn dantes star rave technique....Hell no lol
[0:58:49] <metabot64> Why is woolie using the doom missle assist to help cover vergil?
[0:58:53] <Metalchaosmaster> I got a vergil poster signed by Dan. he's a lad
[0:58:58] <MettleWolf> Missed his judgement cut moment
[0:59:06] <+Eaglestrike117> Always remember pool noodle hentai
[0:59:06] <+QueequegTheater> Use your charge shot tho
[0:59:06] <metabot64> isn"t*
[0:59:08] <NYCrownlessKing> dan? you mean the.. QUANTUM RANGER Kappa
[0:59:20] <+JayEarly> I love that Reuban requested Power Ranger veterans specifically
[0:59:21] <hntronium> !uptime
[0:59:22] <Siregulus> Blitz is like that one guy who just says NO I WANNA BE THE BAD GUY FUCK YOU
[0:59:23] <bazz_tv> WOOLIE JUST JUDGMENT CUT WHEN HE DOES THE LAZER
[0:59:27] <+lozscat> CHARGE SHOT?
[0:59:31] <InfiniteSwagbito> "LET THEM FIGHT"
[0:59:31] <+alphonseisbest> @soushinsen hows narutos kid the game?
[0:59:32] <candidateplays> See this is where Just Judgement Cuts would come in usefuk
[0:59:38] <neozz13> @rincewind1998 I’d imagine he always could but only because Yamato taps into his devil side
[0:59:40] <+lozscat> B A D D O G G O
[0:59:40] <MettleWolf> he missed several judgment cut moments
[0:59:41] <+QueequegTheater> Woolie Vs. Ken Watanabe
[0:59:44] <WG101> that's something vergil would do
[0:59:50] <+TsunamiPoro> Vergil is the King Ghidorah of humans
[0:59:50] <joylent_blue> blitz is taking the day off
[0:59:55] <+RaidenZal> Can you Judgement Cut End a Blitz, or does it still counterhit you?
[0:59:57] <ConfusedCultist> Blitz would never hurt a doggo
[1:00:01] <ConfusedCultist> oh
[1:00:02] <bazz_tv> the most exciting DMC4 gameplay on Twitch everybody
[1:00:02] <+Eaglestrike117> oh yeah i forgot i have that naruto game
[1:00:05] <gunstar73> Lame it out like x tekken
[1:00:07] <+Eaglestrike117> it plays great for me
[1:00:07] <BelMadness> damn, what a spammer
[1:00:10] <+Eaglestrike117> love it
[1:00:11] <@SoushinSen> @alphonseisbest the PS4 version is still alive. i'm currently streaming it right now but i'm on standby so i'm watching woolie's stream
[1:00:15] <mr_ESB> If blitz comes back in 5 omfg haha
[1:00:15] <brambobelurkin> Speaking of "let them fight" anyone see the new statues for the King Of the Monsters?
[1:00:21] <+VVardy> I hope blitz comes back in DMC5, but doesn't have this melee invincibility phase
[1:00:22] <odd_slater> I don't like fighting Blitz
[1:00:25] <+Th3SmartAlec> Blitz has now entered "You didn't win" mode
[1:00:28] <+moranprime> @mr_ESB And meaner than ever.
[1:00:30] <InfiniteSwagbito> @Eaglestrike117 I haven't played it since like a few weeks past release, any major changes?
[1:00:35] <+Eaglestrike117> Billy do you see the same players constantly on PS4
[1:00:40] <+Eaglestrike117> Cause i do on PC
[1:00:40] <FatDragonQuest> So I have a question regarding Kirby: What power do you want to see happen in the next game
[1:00:42] <neozz13> Like Vergil himself could create summoned swords and Dante himself could create roses
[1:00:49] <iziwings> turns out that when blitz teleports in like that against dante the best thing to do it spam pin up with lucifer, it's one of the only moves that doesn't get you shocked by his lightning and the pins exploding makes him vulnerable before he gets to attack
[1:00:54] <+lozscat> DO COMBO
[1:00:54] <+Eaglestrike117> Also they added more jutsu
[1:00:55] <bazz_tv> no green orbs for you
[1:00:56] <MettleWolf> We need an LP of Billy playing DMC2
[1:00:57] <juxtest> Pup Snuffer Style
[1:00:57] <Graxe_> Why not use Heavy Rain Swords to paralyze enemies for a bit?
[1:01:08] <Metalchaosmaster> r1 forward and square swords are op tho
[1:01:08] <ConfusedCultist> Gotta run night everyone
[1:01:13] <@SoushinSen> @Eaglestrike117 depends on the time, but yes, sometimes i get teh same playersa few matches in a row.
[1:01:14] <+Eaglestrike117> they added a bunch of the hokages, jiraya and orochimaru as characters and masters for DLC
[1:01:15] <+JayEarly> Are Dante and Vergil wizards?
[1:01:16] <+TsunamiPoro> gn
[1:01:19] <eggsnbakefest> Why not Samurai Kirby aka Vergil Kirby
[1:01:22] <neozz13> @graxe_ I don’t think he knows or remembers it
[1:01:23] <RenzoTheLion> @ConfusedCultist have a good one!
[1:01:26] <Rincewind1998> @neozz13 I think it's been stated in either a document or a quote from a designer that Nero's power is just the spectral arm and absorbing power. The vergil stand and swords are directly from absorbing Yamato/Vergil's soul
[1:01:27] <FatDragonQuest> @Eaglestrike117 wait for Kirby?
[1:01:32] <+Eaglestrike117> Minatos Jutsus are bullshit, i love it
[1:01:37] <+Th3SmartAlec> @Graxe_ I thought you were talking about Heavy Rain and got super confused
[1:01:37] <WG101> @ConfusedCultist night dude
[1:01:42] <InfiniteSwagbito> @Eaglestrike117 What are they?
[1:01:44] <+haseoseerlane> @JayEarly Yes
[1:01:45] <mr_ESB> Hoping for green orbs
[1:01:47] <etalmeta> I think the glyphs that dante creates for air hike and his air dash can be considered specifically his power as opposed to the devil arms.
[1:01:49] <+Eaglestrike117> Flying Rajins
[1:01:51] <bazz_tv> Dante is but Vergil judgment nutted once @JayEarly
[1:01:52] <+alphonseisbest> man does call of Chtaulu just end up going nowhere, Bloodborne remains the best love craft game yet
[1:01:53] <Graxe_> Input for Heavy Rain Swords was like back-forward or something.
[1:01:57] <Metalchaosmaster> shcum
[1:02:02] <+cvp5127> @JayEarly vergil isnt
[1:02:03] <InfiniteSwagbito> @Eaglestrike117 I figured but what does that actually mean in terms of the game
[1:02:05] <MettleWolf> This game destroys my hands
[1:02:08] <@SoushinSen> New Meta, must pay for DLC. so pay 2 win, essentially
[1:02:09] <+TsunamiPoro> Bloodborne remains the best game period
[1:02:09] <+Th3SmartAlec> WOW HE WHIFFED
[1:02:15] <bignerb> got the grorbs
[1:02:17] <brambobelurkin> truth
[1:02:25] <+QueequegTheater> DS2 > DS1, Lucatiel > Solaire
[1:02:27] <joylent_blue> FUCK
[1:02:27] <+Eaglestrike117> He has Flying Rajin which is a teleport, FR level 2 with the rasengan, and his ult is his super from the ninja storm games
[1:02:28] <+alphonseisbest> amen
[1:02:29] <gustavozxd> the back forward gun moves happened by accident all the time with me
[1:02:32] <+Eaglestrike117> Its so broken
[1:02:35] <InfiniteSwagbito> @SoushinSen Welp, there goes the last bit of my motivation to play Strikers again
[1:02:38] <+TsunamiPoro> Nothing has ever been cooler than lady maria
[1:02:40] <+Eaglestrike117> also yeah, you see a lot of DLC skills
[1:02:45] <+Eaglestrike117> in PVP
[1:02:50] <+Eaglestrike117> cause they are really good
[1:02:57] <+Th3SmartAlec> Really lucky Blitz here
[1:02:57] <bazz_tv> rorbs are pointless once you are fully upgraded
[1:02:58] <FatDragonQuest> am I a loser for thinking Ornstein and Artorias are cool
[1:02:58] <+Eaglestrike117> Healers finnally getting a DLC in tsunade
[1:03:05] <brambobelurkin> I liked Kos the most out of the DLC to be honest
[1:03:10] <MettleWolf> coward
[1:03:10] <eggsnbakefest> Artorias is the shit
[1:03:11] <+lozscat> NAH RISK IT
[1:03:15] <PlumpPotatoRump> hi chat hope y'all doing good
[1:03:17] <AlasterAngelo> if you don't risk it how are you going to get the biscuit
[1:03:18] <bazz_tv> HE IS TOO SCURRD
[1:03:21] <+QueequegTheater> "Am I a loser for liking two of the most popular bosses in the series"
[1:03:22] <+TsunamiPoro> But Lady Maria is just so fucking cool
[1:03:23] <neozz13> Lady maria isn’t even cooler than the person who taught her
[1:03:23] <+VVardy> new tech in a 10 year old game, man I love DMC4
[1:03:24] <Sedrelic> no grace
[1:03:28] <+Eaglestrike117> what do you run anyway billy build wise
[1:03:29] <InfiniteSwagbito> he did it twice?
[1:03:29] <WG101> RISKING IS ALL PART OF MOTIVATION, WOOLIE
[1:03:31] <iziwings> just frame judgement cut specifically is useful in that situation so yeah maybe don't
[1:03:32] <+moranprime> That one assault ate it hard
[1:03:33] <gunstar73> Why was strikers made
[1:03:34] <RenzoTheLion> do some training on stream woolie, don't be afraid
[1:03:36] <+Th3SmartAlec> Judgement Nutted too soon Woolie
[1:03:37] <+askalta> i feel like that was an accident
[1:03:37] <+Robopengy> @brambobelurkin Some say Kosm
[1:03:38] <+TsunamiPoro> @neozz13 i will fight you
[1:03:40] <+JayEarly> Judgement Cut End reminds me of Tate in the PS2 Shinobi game
[1:03:41] <WG101> @gunstar73 money
[1:03:41] <alrobot2014> they didn't even spawn yet and they still died
[1:03:41] <joylent_blue> oh fuck this room
[1:03:59] <mr_ESB> I forget which floor has 2 blitz at once
[1:04:00] <bazz_tv> what floor is this?
[1:04:08] <neozz13> @tsunamiporo If you take cues from Maria you’ll lose
[1:04:12] <DemonicCipher> @WoolieVersus what headphones do you use Woolie?
[1:04:16] <MettleWolf> Just play the game perfectly and never get hit, it's that easy.
[1:04:25] <gunstar73> I thought it was just another naruto fighting game until I saw woolies vid on it
[1:04:26] <+lozscat> SIP BREAK
[1:04:28] <brambobelurkin> Her fight is awesome its up there for sure, but I dig that nasty aborted Old one as the final fight though, and how abusive he can be if you underestimate him.
[1:04:28] <+moranprime> @WoolieVersus 2 Blitzs at the same time is too scary
[1:04:33] <iziwings> i remember there's a room in ldk with two blitzes
[1:04:33] <@SoushinSen> @Eaglestrike117 I main healer, so cellullar extraction, air palm, feather illusion. Top armor recovery. bottom armor max HP. accessory fat cooldown when low health
[1:04:38] <+HelloImTom08> finally caught a stream sofiePog
[1:04:41] <Doctor_Death_Bed> apatBig SIP
[1:04:44] <Graxe_> Oh man, I forgot about the Lunar Phase buzz saw by teleport cancelling Lunar Phase into another Lunar Phase.
[1:04:46] <eggsnbakefest> @WoolieVersus what if Samurai/Vergil Kirby in next Kirby game
[1:04:46] <FairOnFire> i don't think we're on dmd yet are we
[1:04:50] <bazz_tv> Judgment nuts
[1:04:50] <PlumpPotatoRump> nice face :D
[1:04:51] <+JustSayAnything> I got a blister from charge shot last time I did BP!
[1:04:56] <CadmiumCore> Yeah Vergil is kinda killer on your hands
[1:04:57] <PhatMoses> stage 86
[1:05:01] <+TsunamiPoro> @neozz13 gherman lost to a slug
[1:05:03] <Bennett_Fracture> dont get your bennett fractured woolie...
[1:05:05] <Bennett_Fracture> ...
[1:05:05] <Metalchaosmaster> blitz are pathetic with nero
[1:05:07] <+moranprime> Dodge all the beam spam LUL
[1:05:09] <jeecay> 2 blitz = 2 much
[1:05:10] <denam_of_windscale> are the floors of BP not random in 4?
[1:05:15] <+Eaglestrike117> You actually play healer? i havent seen that many of em on PC
[1:05:21] <Guntanks_in_Space> the pros have the weirder variant of multi-blitz
[1:05:23] <+Eaglestrike117> Fuckin nice though
[1:05:23] <ShreddingPixels> Nero makes Blitz super easy
[1:05:23] <deviljhojho94> Classic
[1:05:24] <+JayEarly> @denam_of_windscale nope
[1:05:24] <+lozscat> mouse
[1:05:25] <+PlayKingdomHeartsGames> How’d you get the game not to tear like mad with vsync setting off? When u turned it on it dipps below 60 for me
[1:05:30] <Guntanks_in_Space> where they just wanna fight two or three Credos at the same time
[1:05:30] <denam_of_windscale> damn
[1:05:36] <bignerb> cursor my love!
[1:05:38] <gustavozxd> blitz as nero are funny, spam the grab and they're done
[1:05:39] <neozz13> @tsunamiporo Maria was also dead before the game started and people parades around her bones like candy
[1:05:42] <+PlayKingdomHeartsGames> When I*
[1:05:42] <InfiniteSwagbito> @Eaglestrike117 Oh, I was a healer main, as well. Eventually I got tired of nobody covering me
[1:05:42] <GoogleyGareth> He got me, he got me with the chair!
[1:05:48] <MettleWolf> @ShreddingPixels it's almost as if this game was made for Nero
[1:05:48] <deviljhojho94> Kill them all woolie
[1:05:49] <joylent_blue> love that combo
[1:05:49] <+lozscat> MOUSE RETURNS!
[1:05:54] <+blastazoid26> I just found out that i have no idea how to use Vergil.
[1:05:56] <jeecay> orarararararrara
[1:05:57] <bearwagon> ye buts its sick
[1:06:01] <bazz_tv> remember to save judgment cut final for the blitz and the faust
[1:06:01] <WG101> B E R Z E R K E R B A R R A G E
[1:06:03] <+TsunamiPoro> @neozz13 everybody dies eventually dude
[1:06:05] <+Eaglestrike117> I swap between Attack and Ranged, Lighting blade, Vanishing Rasengan and Minatos ult for attack, Fireball, Chidori and Kirin for Ranged
[1:06:05] <+cvp5127> immersion ruined
[1:06:06] <+lozscat> All hail Mouse!
[1:06:14] <eggsnbakefest> Vergil out here with Weapon X
[1:06:15] <deviljhojho94> where is the crikLore
[1:06:17] <+JayEarly> Faust is so cool
[1:06:17] <Rincewind1998> So what does concentration do?
[1:06:18] <strider_kun299> *insert katamari theme here*
[1:06:21] <gigiaten> CONCENTRATE ON MOUSE CHAT
[1:06:21] <MegboyManuel> Mouse-kun!
[1:06:22] <Downcom1ng> Mouse 2: Return of the Mouse
[1:06:25] <AlisaBoss> The mouse is the true style beast
[1:06:26] <neozz13> @tsunamiporo You die if you’re as shitty as her
[1:06:27] <Bennett_Fracture> as if vergil inst allowed to lose his cool once in a while eh...
[1:06:30] <+cvp5127> cursor chan
[1:06:33] <+QueequegTheater> theater mode bois
[1:06:34] <+moranprime> Vergil clearly inspired by his fight with Wolverine Kappa
[1:06:41] <InfiniteSwagbito> @Rincewind1998 Concentration effects everything, the higher the concentration the more effects/damage he does
[1:06:44] <+Eaglestrike117> Also yeah ive made it my mission in life to keep healers alive whenever i see em, i know they get shafted in most things
[1:06:45] <+lozscat> Mouse-kun
[1:06:45] <juxtest> Im covering the cursor with my own cursor so nobody can see it
[1:06:46] <TheMilhouseExperience> I love that he is the only one with a spinning twist. So elegant, but it takes so much momentum.
[1:06:48] <+moranprime> Just needs to Wolverine dive kick pose for skyfall Kappa
[1:06:48] <WG101> FUCKING STRUTS
[1:06:50] <+Thorn14> Hey Chat, Woolie
[1:06:50] <Shiranui24> @WoolieVersus well he would have only been able to use it that one time he was really mad at dante
[1:06:50] <+JustSayAnything> Mouse lowers concentration.
[1:06:52] <joylent_blue> mouse-chan VoHiYo
[1:06:57] <FatDragonQuest> Okay can we get a new captain commando or battle circuit game please
[1:06:59] <+lozscat> Noo
[1:07:02] <brambobelurkin> shes returned to us
[1:07:03] <+blastazoid26> How many floors are there?
[1:07:04] <bazz_tv> the judgment mouse
[1:07:10] <MettleWolf> But why does Vergil fight?
[1:07:10] <Bennett_Fracture> i am having a typographical errors syndrome today...
[1:07:12] <eggsnbakefest> If Vergil had been in the cinematic MvC3 trailers, would he have fought Wesker?
[1:07:16] <WG101> judgement cut to judgement cut is a true combo
[1:07:18] <+VVardy> I wonder if scarecrows will show up in 5, or if they'll get entirely replaced by Seven Hells
[1:07:19] <+TsunamiPoro> @neozz13 She dies and is then immortalized in the nightmare tho
[1:07:20] <Bennett_Fracture> i hate it...
[1:07:23] <JJCheeker> Hey Woolie hey chat! prerecRich /
[1:07:23] <blairINtheUSA> How am I supposed to feel like I their being beaten up by Vergil
[1:07:27] <WG101> @eggsnbakefest absolutely
[1:07:30] <neozz13> I don’t know, Vergil is always wild, he just tries to be precise. Like a shoryureppa and slashing the area around you is wild
[1:07:32] <InfiniteSwagbito> @Rincewind1998 max concentration with katana increases range of attacks, increases damage of beowulf, increases number of attacks with force edge
[1:07:33] <+Mrthefro> Just heard Daredevil got cancelled. Kill me now.
[1:07:40] <@SoushinSen> alright, break's over, bye everyone
[1:07:43] <+WindUpEstinien> vergil's so fucking cool i can't get over it
[1:07:46] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> you can spam the trick teleport with yamato and just hit em in the air forever
[1:07:47] <WG101> see ya @SoushinSen
[1:07:47] <iziwings> look at this ldk room
[1:07:50] <+Eaglestrike117> Ay, see ya billy
[1:07:51] <candidateplays> Concentration = longer range on yamato, more damage on JC, access to higher charges on Beowulf, more hits on force edge
[1:07:52] <+WindUpEstinien> bye bye billy
[1:07:54] <+QueequegTheater> When Vergil judgement cuts, are the slashes moving fast or teleporting?
[1:07:55] <Prism_Wing> @mrthefro lmao wow.
[1:07:57] <mr_ESB> Mega scarecrows, perfect combo dummies lol
[1:07:58] <bazz_tv> that a lot of bugs
[1:07:59] <joylent_blue> fuck this room too

[1:08:33] <neozz13> @tsunamiporo Gherman became an old fart and could still kick your ass. Old age is his prime state
[1:08:41] <Metalchaosmaster> bruh I dipped 5 times for this game since 2008
[1:08:47] <Downcom1ng> Ouch
[1:08:57] <+TsunamiPoro> @neozz13 He can't even leave his own dream
[1:09:00] <thetreebuddy> Its bright outside the window...where is Woolie rn?
[1:09:13] <FatDragonQuest> okay theoretical question but if they made a new kirby anime, do you want it to just be kirby, or have it be a mecha anime with robobot
[1:09:15] <neozz13> @tsunamiporo To kick everyone else’s ass out of it
[1:09:21] <bazz_tv> inb4 no green orbs
[1:09:21] <deviljhojho94> hmmmm
[1:09:22] <+QueequegTheater> The Woolie Hole has its own renewable light sourceszx
[1:09:32] <gigiaten> @thetreebuddy it's not a window, it's a shelf with lighting
[1:09:32] <+TsunamiPoro> @neozz13 and then he
[1:09:33] <bignerb> those are his cabinets @thetreebuddy
[1:09:34] <brambobelurkin> Here we see the wild Woolie in his most natural of habitats.
[1:09:36] <WG101> we're getting there
[1:09:36] <deviljhojho94> Robo anime is good but only if the robots are abominations like kirby
[1:09:38] <+TsunamiPoro> @neozz13 still loses
[1:09:39] <+lozscat> Just kirby
[1:09:53] <neozz13> Woolie if you shoryu the Faust’s, you can shoryu the blitzes
[1:09:55] <+QueequegTheater> Just Kirbica
[1:09:57] <+sundayafternoon1> those are woolies display lights
[1:09:58] <ChineseNininga> Robo anime is good but only if there's no shit kids
[1:10:03] <joylent_blue> and on SoS

[1:10:47] <lordrocca> Round Trip for Fausts.
[1:10:50] <+VVardy> Man Vergil in BP is so fucking fast look at the all the time he has
[1:10:51] <Graxe_> When you think about it, Vergil is the one character in DMC that always has a support Pod with him at all times with his Summoned Swords. He can even shoot them at any time for extra damage like the Pods in Nier.
[1:10:54] <iziwings> oh man look at that jpeg
[1:11:00] <eggsnbakefest> Oh, that wasn't it
[1:11:02] <gustavozxd> I wonder how crazy the jobber nelo angelo guy is gonna get in 5, he didn't do anything worthwhile in the gameplay videos so far
[1:11:04] <eggsnbakefest> Is this it
[1:11:06] <bazz_tv> wow framerate got really bad there
[1:11:10] <mr_ESB> Here comes the floor
[1:11:11] <AlasterAngelo> ultra weeb Vergil can't get enough swords
[1:11:14] <eggsnbakefest> Back to where we started?
[1:11:14] <+moranprime> The 2B in DMC4SE PC mod is too good.
[1:11:25] <deviljhojho94> Vergil is living the weeb dream
[1:11:30] <deviljhojho94> Unlimited katana works
[1:11:31] <neozz13> @gustavozxd On dmd, boss life bars just pop up
[1:11:33] <+blastazoid26> mOthEr
[1:11:34] <eggsnbakefest> IT'S TIME TO GET A LITTLE MOTIVATED

[1:11:42] <WG101> "THIS ANIME SWORD IS FOR NERDS, YOU JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND"
[1:11:43] <+cvp5127> fa-father
[1:11:43] <+Analogflame> the devil trigger music mod is better

[1:12:35] <Graxe_> I've seen Blitzes do that. It sucks.
[1:12:36] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> that happens almost every time for me lol
[1:12:37] <alrobot2014> HE GOES FOR THAT LONG?
[1:12:39] <MettleWolf> ! concentration at risk !

[1:12:48] <strider_kun299> EVO Moment #500
[1:12:50] <+lozscat> STREAM SNIPED
[1:12:51] <xiccy> Blitz's are cool but suck
[1:12:55] <OwlLightningMage> They're patching in new things as you stream WutFace
[1:12:55] <mistermastergreg> ganbareee
[1:12:55] <+DHB05> thats crazy lol
[1:12:56] <eggsnbakefest> @WoolieVersus looks like you're finally motivated
[1:12:56] <+VVardy> I've seen two, never four
[1:12:58] <Siregulus> i missed it lytNOTIKETHIS
[1:12:58] <Graxe_> If you keep avoiding it, they just keep shooting the beam.
[1:13:00] <bazz_tv> SWING FIRST
[1:13:07] <blairINtheUSA> SCHUM
[1:13:09] <Graxe_> Especially when berserk.
[1:13:10] <Prism_Wing> I swing mybbn laser back and forth!
[1:13:22] <TheMilhouseExperience> Most I've ever gotten was 5.
[1:13:22] <+cvp5127> scum Kreygasm
[1:13:25] <MettleWolf> Twitch interaction would be a nightmare for this game.
[1:13:41] <mr_ESB> Bael\Dagon soon
[1:13:41] <JooseNeck> Its Twitch integration.. we told him to do it Kappa
[1:13:46] <brambobelurkin> dmv bloody palace twitch mode lmao
[1:13:51] <lordrocca> Force Edge is a good tool for crowd control to minimize blind hits from lesser enemies.
[1:13:57] <+lozscat> did vergil ever had a theme?
[1:13:57] <neozz13> He has 3 different phases for red. One is spamming long range, 2 is spamming the kamikaze, three is spamming close range and kamikaze alternately
[1:14:00] <Graxe_> Bloody Palace - Stream Mode: Chat determines what spawns in the next floor.
[1:14:00] <brambobelurkin> dmcV*
[1:14:01] <+Analogflame> u think vergil will have beowulf in 5?
[1:14:05] <iziwings> bael time
[1:14:14] <bazz_tv> SAPO time
[1:14:14] <BelMadness> imagine being Nero and knowing that he will never ever be even half as cool as his Dad
[1:14:17] <+QueequegTheater> Vergil got rid of Beowulf
[1:14:20] <AlasterAngelo> @Graxe_ 3 blitzes and Berial
[1:14:22] <WG101> OH JESUS CHRIST WHAT IS THAT
[1:14:23] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> ur not human are u?
[1:14:24] <alrobot2014> blitz would always spawn in that case
[1:14:25] <eggsnbakefest> Probably won't have it, since he canonically gave it to Dante
[1:14:25] <+Doctor_Valor> Eyyyyyy
[1:14:25] <candidateplays> He has no reason to have Beowulf
[1:14:29] <Siregulus> froge
[1:14:33] <brambobelurkin> make it like Vermintide 2. Does Dante get Health or a blitz next floor?
[1:14:35] <joylent_blue> i think vergil will have a different fist weapon
[1:14:37] <+Analogflame> its cool tho. Thats a reason
[1:14:38] <eggsnbakefest> Well, *gave* is a strong word
[1:14:39] <neozz13> @analogflame He’ll have gauntlets from Nelo Angelo
[1:14:42] <+cvp5127> oops all blitzes
[1:14:43] <+VVardy> Oh man Vergil just utterly fucks Frog boy
[1:14:43] <iziwings> oh my god you got the ice off him instantly lmao
[1:14:47] <Metalchaosmaster> he probably have some type of gauntlets tho
[1:14:48] <MettleWolf> It's my sister in-law @WG101

[1:15:00] <oAznoUta> oh hey it's that guy. playing as that guy.
[1:15:02] <+JayEarly> “You are not worthy as my opponent” is my favorite version of “you ain’t shit”

[1:15:16] <joylent_blue> GREED ISLAND
[1:15:21] <deviljhojho94> gotcha bitch
[1:15:23] <AlasterAngelo> how embarrassing
[1:15:24] <BelMadness> do the move where Vergil fucks the bait sluts
[1:15:27] <neozz13> Vergil doesn’t fuck bael up since Woolie doesn’t use Beowulf
[1:15:35] <iziwings> that was like 40 seconds
[1:15:39] <TheMilhouseExperience> Correct me if I'm wrong can't you twiddle the stick to escape?
[1:15:42] <bazz_tv> that was sloopy
[1:15:42] <JooseNeck> Dmc4 twitch mode: chat votes on whether the next room should spawn the LDK number of enemies Kappa

[1:16:09] <joylent_blue> OH SHIT THIS LOOKS SICK
[1:16:11] <iziwings> the boss literally just gave you health but here's your heal room i guess
[1:16:12] <gustavozxd> god DmC is so fucking lazy, 5th crash already, not to mention all the AI bugs
[1:16:14] <mr_ESB> 40 yea
[1:16:18] <+JayEarly> now it’s a party
[1:16:22] <lordrocca> Round Trip for the flowers.
[1:16:23] <candidateplays> Man, I wish this game had a training mode
[1:16:28] <Graxe_> Difficulty increase either now or soon. I think it's on Son of Sparda?
[1:16:32] <joylent_blue> round trip is your friend
[1:16:42] <MettleWolf> You need concentration boi
[1:16:43] <+Eaglestrike117> it does have a training mode
[1:16:44] <Buttsoup_Barnes> all good man
[1:16:45] <+Analogflame> nah ur good. It takes lots of focusing and motivation to succeed
[1:16:46] <+blastazoid26> MOTIVATED
[1:16:47] <InfiniteSwagbito> the fuck is that gif with the akira arm
[1:16:48] <+Eaglestrike117> its called the story
[1:16:48] <+queuecumber555> Does Vergil look more bulky in that jacket than Dante does in his or is it just me?
[1:16:49] <OwlLightningMage> Ignore harder
[1:16:52] <+WindUpEstinien> no need to apologize, you need your motivation
[1:16:53] <+lozscat> nah ignore chat
[1:16:54] <yuribo26> EXCUSES FAKE FAN SwiftRage
[1:16:56] <mr_ESB> I think higher floors spam plant enemies
[1:16:59] <deviljhojho94> D:
[1:17:01] <Explodincatz> combos are more important than chat
[1:17:02] <MettleWolf> @Eaglestrike117 exactly
[1:17:02] <+VVardy> Oh good lord it's chimeara assaults
[1:17:08] <WG101> DO A BIG MOTIVATE

[1:17:16] <+ledshamans> i got here once on the original version of DMC4 and got annihilated
[1:17:19] <MettleWolf> Bloody Palace is the real game
[1:17:22] <+Eaglestrike117> bloody palace
[1:17:22] <+Analogflame> bloody palace
[1:17:34] <AlasterAngelo> this palace isn't even bloody
[1:17:36] <deviljhojho94> MOTIVATION IS MY ONLY SUSTENT
[1:17:36] <bazz_tv> booby palace
[1:17:38] <+JayEarly> @mr_esb My favorite!
[1:17:41] <AlasterAngelo> we're not even in a palace
[1:17:45] <gustavozxd> @queuecumber555 he totally does, and vergil isn't even that muscular, at least in dmc3 with his jacketless alt
[1:17:46] <+WindUpEstinien> bloody palace is the kirby's true arena of dmc
[1:17:48] <deviljhojho94> Its not either apalace or bloody
[1:17:49] <WG101> @AlasterAngelo it will be once vergil's done with it
[1:17:52] <Graxe_> Chimera Assaults aren't too bad if you keep Spiral Swords on as much as possible.
[1:17:54] <optosi> DMC5 colour palette
[1:18:00] <Inebriateddonut> There is a stage later on that is literally just blood hell
[1:18:03] <+Eaglestrike117> @WoolieVersus is it possible to turn up the brightness just a tad? Its kinda dark for som epeople
[1:18:06] <TheMilhouseExperience> Must calibrate television to be perfect.
[1:18:06] <+haseoseerlane> @AlasterAngelo do you not see the glowing blood red animation on the floor? I'd say its plenty bloody
[1:18:10] <+lozscat> New DMC 5 gameplay
[1:18:17] <mr_ESB> Chimeras, chimeras everywhere
[1:18:21] <gustavozxd> the bp backgrounds in this game look weird after the first one
[1:18:32] <+VVardy> Chimera's as Nero is probably the slowest fucking thing
[1:18:34] <alrobot2014> i can't see the chimera assaults in the darkness

[1:20:25] <bignerb> vital stars
[1:20:34] <+xS1D3SW1P3x> Even with all those Orbs, Dante still cant pay the rent for his shop
[1:20:46] <Metalchaosmaster> and yet his health bar ain't maxed out
[1:20:51] <+haseoseerlane> @alrobot2014 after they released the new white standard xbox one S all the controllers from then on were bluetooth enabled( except the elite cuz that was in production before that)
[1:20:54] <gunstar73> Should gotten to take Vergils greatest weapon the sniper rifle
[1:21:03] <gustavozxd> all these rorb coins and nothing to buy with em
[1:21:09] <Thalchampz> LUL
[1:21:09] <MettleWolf> quick use a vital star
[1:21:17] <joylent_blue> at least devote a part of this stream to maxing out that health bar
[1:21:33] <SirAlan76> do you imagine a blitz with chimera LUL
[1:21:34] <antthefool> Oh shit sick I finally got to catch a stream here
[1:21:36] <DjFrostBite95> LUL
[1:21:36] <critterisathing> Hey that’s me!
[1:21:40] <+cvp5127> LUL
[1:21:42] <alrobot2014> @haseoseerlane thank you for this new knowledge
[1:21:44] <gustavozxd> you can actually use items in dmc2 bp and that's the only way I was able to beat it
[1:21:45] <+JayEarly> @xs1d3sw1p3x sadly the landlord doesn’t accept demon blood
[1:21:46] <candidateplays> The easiest way to deal with these guys is to never let them get to that phase.
[1:21:54] <gunstar73> Big cowardice for big bois
[1:21:55] <alrobot2014> @haseoseerlane now i don't need 20ft long usb cables
[1:21:57] <dracovastor> show him that JUDGEMENT NUTT!!
[1:21:59] <+VVardy> It's the blitz and the many frosts
[1:22:01] <+Analogflame> MOTIVATED
[1:22:08] <gustavozxd> good luck doing dmc2 bloody palace when those fucking wolves show up
[1:22:16] <Buttsoup_Barnes> N U T
[1:22:17] <Inebriateddonut> Fuck berial, Blitz is the true conqueror of the fire hell
[1:22:18] <MettleWolf> A legit Blitz boss would be so cool
[1:22:19] <eggsnbakefest> Stupid question, DMC Vergil or DmC Vergil? I feel like that's not even a contest
[1:22:19] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> doesn't the blitz lose his electricity after 2 summon sword barrages?
[1:22:22] <gustavozxd> the lock on goats too
[1:22:25] <DjFrostBite95> $5 rooPog
[1:22:33] <bazz_tv> is not the journey but the Blitzes that almost kill us in the way
[1:22:34] <+lozscat> what happened in dmc2 storywise?
[1:22:41] <+xS1D3SW1P3x> @JayEarly Good thing the Pizza delivery guy does though
[1:22:42] <+Analogflame> a helicopter crashed
[1:22:52] <+blastazoid26> LUL
[1:22:56] <gustavozxd> @eggsnbakefest character and gameplay, og vergil wins easy
[1:22:56] <Metalchaosmaster> Dante fought a demon helicopter
[1:22:56] <+WindUpEstinien> big ceo guy wants to be a demon god
[1:22:56] <TyrantAlexandria> I Tried Playing DMC2 like Two Weeks Ago and Wow That's Way Worse than I Though
[1:22:58] <+Eaglestrike117> Ay almost halfway boys
[1:22:59] <WG101> @xS1D3SW1P3x the pizza guy is the true mvp
[1:23:06] <dracovastor> doodHokey
[1:23:19] <WG101> @WindUpEstinien isn't that the plot of DmC?
[1:23:21] <Buttsoup_Barnes> heihachi tries to fight dante but loses
[1:23:22] <joylent_blue> when the easy levels make you nervous LUL
[1:23:27] <Revant_tillywink> how long has woolie been doing this one palace?
[1:23:37] <VentusHero> !uptime
[1:23:40] <gustavozxd> DmC has a lot of things from dmc2 actually
[1:23:40] <+WindUpEstinien> @WG101 you can see where the inspiration comes from
[1:23:44] <+lozscat> Best RUN
[1:23:48] <+lozscat> so far
[1:23:49] <WG101> @WindUpEstinien oh good lord
[1:23:52] <+WindUpEstinien> also dmc2 was actually my first dmc as a kid
[1:23:58] <InfiniteSwagbito> @eggsnbakefest Idk man DmC Vergil has the Vergilmobile and the ancient angel weapon "Sniper Rifle"
[1:24:05] <+WindUpEstinien> so it has a strange place in my heart
[1:24:09] <Supabait> stage 50 PogChamp
[1:24:11] <joylent_blue> Revant_tillywink ehhhhh 20~ mins?
[1:24:13] <Morning_Asakura> @InfiniteSwagbito good point
[1:24:14] <Metalchaosmaster> ye dmc2 was my first too lol
[1:24:17] <+Ulltraman7> Feelin good about feelin good
[1:24:19] <TyrantAlexandria> Also Thanks Wools for Making Me Buy the HD Collection Again, Royal Guard vs. Vergil Feels So Good
[1:24:21] <eggsnbakefest> Please tell me it's not actually just called "Sniper Rifle"
[1:24:22] <+WindUpEstinien> #LuciaGang
[1:24:23] <Buttsoup_Barnes> feeling...motivated?
[1:24:25] <Lion_kun> what level is Dante
[1:24:28] <gustavozxd> those flying babies in DmC are almost the exact same enemy in dmc2, visually and moveset
[1:24:33] <joylent_blue> Lion_kun 101
[1:24:40] <chaozagents> @WoolieVersus have you played the latest kirby DLC yet?
[1:24:47] <+lozscat> #Oliviagang
[1:24:47] <Prism_Wing> Did one of those mannequins just say "WATAAA"? PogChamp
[1:24:57] <Lion_kun> But there are a 100 levels
[1:25:06] <Metalchaosmaster> Olivia lmao
[1:25:13] <Graxe_> What's really nice about Spiral Swords is that since they count as projectile hits, they help take down the Chimera part of the infected Assaults and Scarecrows and the Mephisto/Faust cloaks just by being near them.
[1:25:18] <joylent_blue> Lion_kun thats what Dante wants you to think
[1:25:34] <etalmeta> @eggsnbakefest there's no name because it's only used in that one scene
[1:25:34] <+xS1D3SW1P3x> I'd pay a million dollars for a Garo crossover in a DMC game. Garo is straight up DMC cut scenes as a show and it's the BEST
[1:25:44] <Downcom1ng> Shink
[1:25:49] <gunstar73> I love how they mark about Lucia being the only good thing from 2 then forget her name
[1:25:50] <MettleWolf> Chimera Blitz, make it happen
[1:25:57] <Inebriateddonut> Wake them up for school
[1:26:11] <Graxe_> I just remember fighting a lot of goat enemies in DMC2.
[1:26:36] <eggsnbakefest> Speaking of names, doesn't DmC Vergil call Yamato something really weird? "Yaymato"? "Yamayto"?
[1:26:37] <+JJAllDay> Man
[1:26:37] <Metalchaosmaster> chimera anything is a bad time
[1:26:40] <+lozscat> Bird just flies as faimly dies
[1:26:43] <AlasterAngelo> @xS1D3SW1P3x haha wouldn't it be great if the DMC anime was straight up DMC cut scenes as a show
[1:26:44] <+JJAllDay> Vergil is the coolest
[1:26:49] <Josef_Stryker> Hey so is Bloody Palace just an enemy rush? Like do u get anything for winning?
[1:26:59] <lordrocca> Pride.
[1:27:02] <Supabait> ANOTHA ONE
[1:27:03] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> big dick points
[1:27:06] <Josef_Stryker> Ok
[1:27:09] <gunstar73> A costume I think not sure
[1:27:09] <WG101> motivation

[1:27:15] <bazz_tv> we are halfway there
[1:27:22] <+Dragon4234> You get motivated
[1:27:25] <Josef_Stryker> So it's just for you to go nuts and get big dick energy if you actually finish it.
[1:27:28] <WG101> you get power
[1:27:30] <+xS1D3SW1P3x> @AlasterAngelo I didnt really like the Anime for DMC
[1:27:31] <Sedrelic> dot eyes vergil
[1:27:33] <TyrantAlexandria> Yep
[1:27:34] <joylent_blue> alright i have to get dinner woolie you better not die before i get back
[1:27:37] <+lozscat> So who is confirmed for dmc 5
[1:27:40] <+JJAllDay> @Josef_Stryker You get Sparda's dad approval
[1:27:44] <the_phantom_theif> But they already are cracked...
[1:27:47] <gustavozxd> DMD frosts NotLikeThis
[1:27:47] <frossanot> Chimera faust, Imagine
[1:27:48] <AlasterAngelo> @xS1D3SW1P3x nobody did
[1:27:49] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> there might actually be a costume reward at the end but I'm not sure
[1:28:04] <DjFrostBite95> No frost here rooSpy
[1:28:04] <deadshot27> @Josef_Stryker pretty sure you can also get the super versions of the characters if you beat it with them.
[1:28:05] <MettleWolf> Virgin and Donte
[1:28:17] <antthefool> That was sick
[1:28:24] <+JayEarly> @frossanot thanks I’m gonna have nightmares about that
[1:28:26] <+MeanGeneTheGodHand> Oh shit, I see someone's gettin' motivated in this bitch
[1:28:40] <+QueequegTheater> Reminder that DmC Dante is more Dante than DMC2 Dante
[1:28:40] <lordrocca> Round Trip for Faust's cloak.
[1:28:42] <gustavozxd> everyone except Vergil and Lucia are confirmed for dmc5
[1:28:43] <+xS1D3SW1P3x> @AlasterAngelo And I kinda forgot it existed tbh
[1:28:52] <+Harawanagangsta> WoolieVSPat
[1:28:53] <lordrocca> "Kick 13" for the rotary blades.
[1:28:58] <DjFrostBite95> cryMonka
[1:29:03] <gustavozxd> but everyone knows vergil is in the game, lucia maybe
[1:29:23] <gunstar73> I kinda wanna see woolie play Isaac again just so he can see all the fucked up shit in the game
[1:29:24] <iziwings> did a just frame judgement cut by accident lmao
[1:29:27] <WG101> yo what the fuck are shields?
[1:29:35] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> never heard of em
[1:29:40] <+wolvenelf> PokCroagunk
[1:29:41] <MettleWolf> I'd love to see Lucia again
[1:29:48] <eggsnbakefest> What stage is Dante at?
[1:29:51] <+JayEarly> @gustavozxd The map from DMC 2 was in the Dante trailer
[1:29:53] <DjFrostBite95> LUL
[1:29:55] <+QueequegTheater> Black French Ninja Waifu
[1:29:58] <Edtango> U N I T
[1:30:01] <ShreddingPixels> 101
[1:30:03] <iziwings> in awe of the motivation of this lad
[1:30:03] <RenzoTheLion> such is the trend of character action characters in fighting games
[1:30:06] <Supabait> Phoenix exists in that game though
[1:30:08] <+JJAllDay> Vergil the Absolute Unit
[1:30:13] <+Qsmash_> I got so tired of watching Vergil in MvC3. god damn
[1:30:20] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> judgement cut end, also known as Room Skip
[1:30:28] <Metalchaosmaster> Well Lucia waits for Dante at devil may cry at the end of 2 so maybe at the start of 5?
[1:30:29] <AggsMK7> A sippy
[1:30:31] <Graxe_> So there's a mod out for DMC4SE that changes Vergil's attack effects to be more like DMC3. So Judgment Cuts are that sphere of cuts instead of the rapid slashes and Beowulf gets its white color back instead of pale yellow.
[1:30:34] <gustavozxd> @jayearly yes! I've seen that, it could be just an easter egg, but who knows.
[1:30:35] <+lozscat> Sip Break
[1:30:35] <brambobelurkin> MOTIVATION
[1:30:38] <MettleWolf> Lucia... wait I meant Mistral
[1:30:47] <iziwings> does bloody palace make you do the agnus window fight
[1:30:48] <+WindUpEstinien> don't activate crazy talk woolie
[1:30:53] <lordrocca> The stupidity begins once the sky is scorched red.
[1:30:57] <+QueequegTheater> Lucia > Mistral
[1:31:03] <InfiniteSwagbito> @WoolieVersus You can get more bang for your Judgement Cut End buck if you do it at the start of the level. The range of it is anything on screen, no need to do it twice from close up
[1:31:05] <+lozscat> MettleWolf you arent wrong
[1:31:10] <gunstar73> The real bloody palace hasn’t even begun
[1:31:25] <C_game_me_811> @queequegtheater Both
[1:31:31] <+JayEarly> @graxe_ there’s so many god damn DMC4 mods
[1:31:41] <FatDragonQuest> I forget if woolie checks the chat because I want to reccommend him the shadowrun games
[1:31:41] <+QueequegTheater> When Godmaster
[1:31:46] <+JayEarly> it’s impressive for a game without mod tools
[1:31:46] <+payatanharkonnen> Show us your tarts

[1:31:57] <+lozscat> tarts?

[1:43:01] <+Jolly_Pale_Giant> Does this have a finish line or is it an infinite challenge?
[1:43:02] <+thepantsking> What the fuck

[1:44:16] <AlasterAngelo> is Vergil fast enough to slap his own ass?
[1:44:16] <joylent_blue> Vergil says NO
[1:44:20] <CelioHogane> @SoushinSen @mothmandraws Any of you here? Got a question.
[1:44:25] <+MeanGeneTheGodHand> What floor do you fight Dante on?
[1:44:27] <gustavozxd> 100 is the shitty boss fight, the 101 the slightly less shitty fight
[1:44:35] <@mothmandraws> ye

[1:45:05] <+WindUpEstinien> lend woolie ur strength \o/
[1:45:05] <AlasterAngelo> Dante 101 cuz he takes you to school
[1:45:07] <+VVardy> Fighting Credo as Dante is probably the most fun you can have in this game
[1:45:08] <lordrocca> Nice camera pan.
[1:45:10] <scrubviewer> every day we are closer to dmc5
[1:45:12] <@mothmandraws> dunno if links are on

[1:45:13] <MettleWolf> Bruh
[1:45:13] <InfiniteSwagbito> 101 Dante can fuck you up
[1:45:14] <@SoushinSen> moth is drawing, i'm playing naruto. we're doing our respective roles
[1:45:21] <gustavozxd> Dante fight isn't that bad i guess but his shotgun on harder difficulties makes it not fun to try no damage
[1:45:22] <Sol_Install> pfft
[1:45:23] <+MeanGeneTheGodHand> Nice. LEMME SEE THAT SHIT, WOOLIE.
[1:45:29] <Sol_Install> @SoushinSen which naturo?

[1:45:43] <HunterMGlengi> where force edge
[1:45:47] <alrobot2014> was that an alto that just got deleted?

[1:46:34] <HunterMGlengi> p sure round trip with force edge can lock down cutlasses
[1:46:34] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus I can't get into Vergil for the same reason I can't get into Charge Blade over my beloved Hammer in MHW. Too much positioning, not enough facesmacking.

[2:10:37] <+ShadowArcangel> there's a coming stage where all they do is that if you let them

[2:37:09] <AChungusAmongUs> If it makes you feel any better, i've choked 101 with nero despite lv 3 gun existing.
[2:37:12] <ShamanKing0811> Tou should allways start from the bottom so it should be good
[2:37:12] <DonatelloJose> the left titty was not strong enough to destroy Dante
[2:37:12] <B_ikki> yeah steam version is the ugh one
[2:37:13] <+Analogflame> DmC won't prepare u for the other ones really. since launch button and etc
[2:37:13] <+Harawanagangsta> Pat gave you a free tiddy
[2:37:15] <+wreativecriting> oh heck I gotta peace out

[2:57:26] <+cerass> johns live on stream
[2:57:28] <TheAzureGamer> @WoolieVersus "I swear this never happens to me"
[2:57:29] <+Tonku_the_Red> He's talking at us but not looking at us!
[2:57:31] <+lozscat> STREAM SNIPED
[2:57:33] <OwlLightningMage> Woolie don't forget that you did a Chaos Roll with a fake team
[2:57:34] <MettleWolf> CHAOS ROLL IS SUPER FUN
[2:57:38] <joylent_blue> woolie used up his skill on BP
[2:57:39] <gunstar73> Johns woolie Johns
[2:57:45] <MettleWolf> Look at how much fun he's having
[2:57:48] <BaikenAndEggs> maybe its not rwally woolie we're seeing.
[2:57:48] <LucidInDarkness> Imagine, chat controlling the Ai LUL
[2:57:59] <+Tonku_the_Red> What's the penalty for having the incorrect game name?
[2:58:02] <OwlLightningMage> He's having so much fun that he hasn't changed the game on Twitch
[2:58:05] <@mothmandraws> death
[2:58:06] <AggsMK7> Death
[2:58:08] <BaikenAndEggs> it may be a hologram, hence why he can't see us. that or it's hellpockets.
[2:58:09] <joylent_blue> death
[2:58:14] <MyNameIsRasus> M O R T I S
[2:58:17] <+dankdirtydan> has woolie even looked at the stream? LUL
[2:58:24] <LucidInDarkness> Nope
[2:58:27] <joylent_blue> woolie hates us BibleThump
[2:58:29] <Downcom1ng> @WoolieVersus Change your game on twitch my dude
[2:58:31] <+cerass> I even tweeted him
[2:58:31] <mongol_800> nup
[2:58:33] <MyNameIsRasus> He refuses
[2:58:34] <+driedputty> New game! New game!
[2:58:34] <OwlLightningMage> I don't want Woolie to mortis from the canada cops BibleThump
[2:58:35] <@mothmandraws> every day a new mod comes to chat and tries to get woolie to see he hasnt changed game name
[2:58:38] <+Tonku_the_Red> @dankdirtydan I think he forgot that he's on stream.
[2:58:39] <@mothmandraws> day 101
[2:58:45] <@mothmandraws> twitch ceo comes to tell him
[2:58:48] <+lozscat> year 12
[2:58:49] <MettleWolf> Woolie is false streaming like Bethesda bags
[2:58:52] <@mothmandraws> can he ignore them
[2:58:54] <startstoprepeat> @WoolieVersus it's end with 4 damage, you can totally repair and still complete it
[2:58:56] <OwlLightningMage> Is this worse or better than Woolie being muted for 5 years?
[2:58:58] <based_lobster> Woolie The Blind
[2:58:59] <MyNameIsRasus> Eon 27
[2:59:12] <+wolfofsound> @mothmandraws they step on his foot simpsons style to get his attention
[2:59:13] <LucidInDarkness> Day 145: They still haven't noticed the stream was hijacked and Woolie is crying for help somewhere rooSpy
[2:59:16] <+dankdirtydan> I think it'd be hilarious if we can raid Pat's stream and get him to call woolie
[2:59:18] <BaikenAndEggs> woolie needs to hire his neighbour as a mod. that way he could knock on his door when he needs to do something asap
[2:59:19] <joylent_blue> this is worse because this is willingly BabyRage
[2:59:24] <gunstar73> 20/20 vision guys never forget
[2:59:24] <OwlLightningMage> Woolie thinks chat cares about game mistakes when everyone is focused on the game not being changed LUL
[2:59:27] <+driedputty> @startstoprepeat Does repairing yourself do that? Never tried.
[2:59:27] <hntronium> Woolie, remember that smoke can disable
[2:59:30] <MyNameIsRasus> Woolie The Blind didn't change the name of 40 streams.

[3:10:55] <kylejefferies> ! BALLS AT RISK !
[3:10:56] <+driedputty> @wolfofsound You have to have bravery for it to be at risk..
[3:10:57] <SafetyBet> Cowards are the true winners Kappa
[3:11:02] <BaikenAndEggs> such a Dante move. Vergil would've stuck with chaos roll.
[3:11:05] <mongol_800> Too much Chaos for Woolz
[3:11:10] <startstoprepeat> judo and mirror are a cool combo
[3:11:11] <gunstar73> Woolie saved 28 timelines but killed 2 pretty good balance
[3:11:12] <+lozscat> JUDO-JET
[3:11:16] <+wolfofsound> Wait is the stream still on DMC?! LUL
[3:11:23] <+lozscat> JET JAGUAR
[3:11:25] <@mothmandraws> pacifist run
[3:11:25] <gryffinp> Acid mech is baller
[3:11:26] <joylent_blue> twitch still says its DMC4 but maybe its just bugging out for me
[3:11:27] <OwlLightningMage> The name of the game still say DMC.
[3:11:27] <NicholasKane> Have you done custom squads?
[3:11:28] <SilverRoddo> ! BALLS EXPOSED !
[3:11:37] <OwlLightningMage> I reloaded the page and everything
[3:11:40] <MyNameIsRasus> IF MY FATHER GOT THROUGH THE CHAOS ROLL THEN I SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO IT TOO
[3:11:41] <startstoprepeat> leap mech best mech
[3:11:42] <+Iggle_Ohs> Yeah, it didn't seem to apply despite him trying to change it earlier.
[3:11:43] <MettleWolf> Woolie isn't a very good time-cop.
[3:11:43] <@mothmandraws> I tried refresh name isnt changed woolie
[3:11:45] <Mucmaster> Chaos Roll
[3:11:48] <Explodincatz> chaos is hard
[3:11:48] <@mothmandraws> its fine its funny
[3:11:50] <ithonmage> @wolfofsound looks like to me
[3:11:50] <+wolfofsound> oh god LUL
[3:11:53] <DonatelloJose> just pick a regular squad my dude
[3:11:56] <+bigbradish> Its fine we still love you
[3:11:56] <gryffinp> You can recover from taking a few hits, you just gotta brave up
[3:11:56] <BaikenAndEggs> name change @woolieversus didnt work
[3:11:57] <+FadingEmber> We love it shut up
[3:11:58] <+gantz_zero> failure isn't not entertainment @WoolieVersus
[3:11:59] <kylejefferies> ! BALLS BROKEN !
[3:12:10] <+lozscat> BALLS BREAKED
[3:12:12] <+driedputty> Just chill out. We're not here for speed runs, just to have fun.
[3:12:12] <gunstar73> It’s ok woolie I’m a coward too
[3:12:14] <+OceanGovernor> monkaS @WoolieVersus the stream name, twitch gonna bop you
[3:12:15] <OwlLightningMage> Failure is big watchable
[3:12:18] <+MrMcCrabby> @WoolieVersus just chase some achievements instead
[3:12:18] <NicholasKane> BUILDING CHAIN YOU FOOL
[3:12:19] <+wolfofsound> @mothmandraws it's even funnier that after all that it's still not update
[3:12:21] <mongol_800> This stream is now about re-rolling squads
[3:12:23] <+Dhrall> It is super watchable
[3:12:26] <MyNameIsRasus> I'm unsubscribing from peachsaliva
[3:12:26] <DonatelloJose> unwatchable, yet I'm here and Pat is muted. Kappa
[3:12:37] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> Well I have no idea what hat this game is, so I won’t blow you up Woolz. This time.
[3:12:38] <jubejube56> lol he really didn't learn about building chain from last time
[3:12:39] <SilverRoddo> Use Balls Softening Gel? Y / N?
[3:12:42] <generalve> THIS IS WOOLIE ASMR MODE keep going !
[3:12:42] <ithonmage> Like a girl or boy your dating, the chat likes being constantly analogized to Kappa
[3:12:43] <+xS1D3SW1P3x> Gotta change the game name on the dashboard or Twitch will be very crossed
[3:12:46] <MettleWolf> Currently playing "Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition"?
[3:12:53] <OwlLightningMage> The Omikron LP is big failure all the time and it might be my favorite LP on the channel LUL
[3:12:59] <NicholasKane> Fire-and-Forget is a great tactical boon, but without Building Chain you can't even use the mech on one half of the map
[3:13:01] <+lozscat> CLUTCH OR KICK
[3:13:14] <Downcom1ng> Wait no, the stream is still DMC4?
[3:13:22] <generalve> this music is hype sipsipDab

[3:13:39] <+kamikazeturtleX> This is not how I remember DMC4
[3:13:43] <OwlLightningMage> I also refreshed. It still hasn't changed
[3:13:45] <joylent_blue> yeah it still says DMC4
[3:13:46] <@mothmandraws> 400 IQ moves
[3:13:53] <BaikenAndEggs> maybe he forgot to save the change
[3:13:56] <gunstar73> It’s ok woolie some people only know how to use shoots
[3:13:58] <+Okicop> dmc: mobile edition

[3:14:17] <Downcom1ng> @WoolieVersus Stream name didn't change
[3:14:18] <MyNameIsRasus> Six sets of brains
[3:14:21] <+OceanGovernor> LUL he probably didnt
[3:14:26] <Downcom1ng> He probably won't see but it's worth a shot
[3:14:26] <+xS1D3SW1P3x> Someone tell Woolie so the Twitch Cops wont get mad
[3:14:31] <+wolfofsound> @generalve you mean sahara?
[3:14:40] <gunstar73> He didn’t hit enter omegalul
[3:14:47] <generalve> yea
[3:14:51] <BaikenAndEggs> @woolieversus You have to change the name of game again, you didn't save it. it's still DMC4 SE.
[3:14:55] <+OceanGovernor> Kinda funny he has looked at chat but dodged the messages LUL
[3:14:56] <+Okicop> someone get Pat to text him
[3:14:58] <MettleWolf> Woolie you fool, the gestapo might come.
[3:15:01] <generalve> surprised someone else in this chat knows lol
[3:15:01] <+wolfofsound> @generalve love his "art" Kregygasm
[3:15:09] <+wolfofsound> Kreygasm *
[3:15:20] <MettleWolf> It changed
[3:15:22] <+wolfofsound> @generalve well I'm also a degenerate

[3:15:52] <@mothmandraws> watch the secret that I do have power to change it and keep changing it back
[3:15:53] <+wolfofsound> man 35 mins. more and I would have guessed right
[3:15:53] <gunstar73> There you go
[3:15:59] <TalisKanju> Seeing Woolie stream is so wild
[3:16:03] <LucidInDarkness> @mothmandraws rooKek
[3:16:07] <NicholasKane> Did you forget about forest fires?
[3:16:08] <+wolfofsound> @mothmandraws please be true
[3:16:13] <+xS1D3SW1P3x> Victory
[3:16:15] <BaikenAndEggs> @mothmandraws that would be evil. and fun.

[3:16:18] <@mothmandraws> lol no but would be funny
[3:16:31] <OwlLightningMage> Mine didn't change. I guess it's just my bad internet
[3:16:34] <+mister___doctor> This ain't DMC4
[3:16:44] <BaikenAndEggs> make woolie go crazy since he's new to streaming on his own.
[3:16:44] <Downcom1ng> Same, it didn't change for me but everyone was saying it's fixed
[3:16:52] <MettleWolf> Sacrifice another pilot for more time on the clock
[3:16:53] <Treyu000> It's still DMC for me
[3:16:57] <+wolfofsound> you may have to refresh
[3:17:01] <joylent_blue> why does it still say dmc BabyRage
[3:17:03] <Downcom1ng> I refreshed several times

[3:17:25] <C_game_me_811> Says into the breach for me

[3:17:39] <+Okicop> woolie magic
[3:17:39] <MettleWolf> It actually changed chat don't worry.
[3:17:48] <Explodincatz> oops
[3:17:52] <+OceanGovernor> Kouhai?
[3:17:54] <NicholasKane> If you want to save the hook mech, you HAVE to heal him, since he's on fire.
[3:17:54] <AggsMK7> RIP hooker bot
[3:18:02] <jubejube56> Mkay we could abandon one more timeline
[3:18:07] <CEGold> w i t c h c r a f t ScaredyCat
[3:18:16] <+wolfofsound> what if that's asuka?!
[3:18:20] <+TsunamiPoro> Woolie works for NERV
[3:18:29] <+Iggle_Ohs> I guess it just takes a while for the new info to get shared between all of Twitch's servers.
[3:18:31] <+xS1D3SW1P3x> Is this game on Switch?
[3:18:32] <+lozscat> ACCEPTABLE LOSSES

[3:18:56] <+wolfofsound> RAVIOLI RAVIOLI don't sacrifice the lolis
[3:18:57] <joylent_blue> sacrifice your friends for more turns in the breach
[3:18:58] <LucidInDarkness> Sacrifice Pat for more time on the Podcast
[3:18:59] <OwlLightningMage> It's like the Xcom LP all over again.
[3:19:01] <kegelsthecorgi> K.I.L.D Killed in the Line of Duty
[3:19:06] <gryffinp> [Plays chaos roll] "ARG! NO, I'M TAKING BUILDING DAMAGE! ARG, RESTART RESTART!" [plays a good squad] "It's fine that I'm losing all of these units."
[3:19:09] <Laecerelius> Woolie will crash a space station full of civilians onto these bugs if it means that one building is saved!

[3:26:19] <joylent_blue> BaikenAndEggs only blue for vergil
[3:26:19] <TLPenn> Ah.
[3:26:20] <+gantz_zero> why do people always ask what the game is
[3:26:32] <+wolfofsound> Yeah they are @SilverRoddo but there was an episode about his past that kinda made them seem like it could be more
[3:26:36] <LucidInDarkness> @gantz_zero Reading is hard rooDerp
[3:26:41] <+Alcamest> @wolfofsound Yeah but Ash is a child and more interested in being the best
[3:26:43] <+gantz_zero> then why ask for text
[3:26:44] <OwlLightningMage> This game is Pokemon Hustle
[3:26:55] <TLPenn> Has he played Star Allies and the Wave 3 content?
[3:26:57] <+lozscat> acceptable losses
[3:27:00] <LucidInDarkness> @Alcamest He'll never not be a child rooBlank

[3:27:10] <lloyddboy> TANKS DO NO DAMAGE
[3:27:18] <jubejube56> it's a 0 damage push
[3:27:38] <SilverRoddo> Ooh! That's scandalous. I'll have to do some serious research.
[3:27:39] <NicholasKane> Shoot psion with tank?
[3:28:16] <+Alcamest> Gotta Catch em all Boiz

[3:30:05] <LucidInDarkness> Best thing about Ash...is Ash-Greninja. Tell me I'm wrong rooSmug
[3:30:28] <SilverRoddo> Use reasoning to truly defeat your enemies.
[3:30:37] <+Alcamest> Best thing about Ash is he doesnt Age
[3:30:38] <+OceanGovernor> rooD WHAT A LOSS
[3:30:58] <LucidInDarkness> @Alcamest Yeah, but he doesn't benefit from it. He's still oblivious
[3:31:20] <LucidInDarkness> Be different if he looked the same, but actually matured the fuck up
[3:31:21] <+Alcamest> Thats his dumb ass fault
[3:31:31] <lloyddboy> DAM
[3:31:40] <+gantz_zero> 80 year old boy

[3:33:49] <gunstar73> @timthechef check out valkyria chronicles good ass strategy game
[3:33:54] <+Alcamest> Leave the tide pods alone
[3:34:00] <LucidInDarkness> @gunstar73 shhh. We don't talk about that moment in pokemon history
[3:34:01] <+gantz_zero> they should've made an Alolan Ashe
[3:34:04] <jubejube56> @TimTheChef I've played most of the first and there are definetly some similaties to fire emblem, definetly it's own thing
[3:34:06] <+gantz_zero> minus the e i guess
[3:34:09] <BaikenAndEggs> @gunstar73 serena also kissed him. and I'm sure pikachu did too. so 2-1 ash is a pokephile
[3:34:10] <gunstar73> Vc 4 is the best
[3:34:15] <Xgwill222> What's good everyone?!
[3:34:19] <+Okicop> I wish I could help with this game but I can barely play checkers :(
[3:34:20] <+TimTheChef> thanks for the recommendations i'll definitely look into it
[3:34:22] <Xgwill222> What's good Woolie?
[3:34:35] <gunstar73> There a demo for on ps4 and switch
[3:34:37] <BaikenAndEggs> Baiken's good
[3:34:43] <+lozscat> Slow is smooth, smooth is fast
[3:35:01] <gunstar73> If you like the demo you’ll definitely like the rest of the game
[3:35:06] <ChineseNininga> no
[3:35:08] <ChineseNininga> Woolie
[3:35:13] <SilverRoddo> A Prima and Wicke action adventure Pokémon spin-off series would be dope.
[3:35:13] <Mucmaster> Zapping will hit the building
[3:35:16] <seycheles> whoa THE woolie!
[3:35:18] <ChineseNininga> your rock pushes the thunder whip mech to the side
[3:35:24] <ChineseNininga> Damn it
[3:35:30] <ChineseNininga> okay all good
[3:35:36] <LucidInDarkness> rooBot beep
[3:35:40] <Mucmaster> Never mind I'm stupid
[3:35:47] <vectorcannonready> Try Stella Glow on 3ds. Atlus and Sega made it. Plays similar to FFTactics.
[3:35:48] <+paladinstarbuster> I enjoy it
[3:35:55] <seycheles> the Tim Duncan of the best friends empire
[3:35:59] <+gantz_zero> a whole 'nother type of stress
[3:36:05] <C_game_me_811> Going good doodGood
[3:36:10] <SafetyBet> Told you to play Necrodancer Kappa
[3:36:10] <BaikenAndEggs> yeah this is not relaxing you one bit. hahaha
[3:36:14] <MyNameIsRasus> Chega no zapzap
[3:36:19] <PerfectAsymmetry> Uh oh
[3:36:21] <gunstar73> Big stress for big decisions
[3:36:32] <+Okicop> you should play noby noby boy. Chill game
[3:36:39] <FatDragonQuest> doing alright, been thinking about picking this up again to help kill the big wait for smash
[3:36:43] <+gantz_zero> the only benefit of this game is his hands aren't going to explode from the stress
[3:36:46] <+wolfofsound> Is this the zapping system?!
[3:36:47] <+gantz_zero> theoretically
[3:36:47] <SilverRoddo> Using the zapping system is never stupid.
[3:36:59] <FatDragonQuest> Did woolie ever beat the bloody palace?
[3:37:01] <+lozscat> The zapping system failed us
[3:37:08] <vectorcannonready> RTSs are very chill games.
[3:37:09] <+gantz_zero> bloody palace beat wollie
[3:37:10] <@mothmandraws> cant you knock that top bug upwards
[3:37:12] <gunstar73> Got to Dante and lost
[3:37:18] <BaikenAndEggs> @fatdragonquest lost to dante
[3:37:20] <gunstar73> He was close tho
[3:37:45] <+gantz_zero> 1/3 left on dante. crushed by one royal guard
[3:37:52] <AggsMK7> Big think
[3:38:00] <SilverRoddo> !sr COMP
[3:38:00] <BaikenAndEggs> that confirms that dante is better than vergil the gerbil
[3:38:06] <+TimTheChef> cogito maxima
[3:38:12] <lloyddboy> F

[3:39:32] <+DeaconBluesClues> Yo this is the shit I have been waiting for
[3:40:03] <MettleWolf> Bouncing between Woolie's and Pat's streams is starting to get tough.
[3:40:11] <+gantz_zero> stab 'n shock
[3:40:15] <jubejube56> you could always just drop the shock
[3:40:38] <+lozscat> Shock has a lot of utility though
[3:40:39] <+Chimeraelite> !uptime
[3:40:42] <+gantz_zero> u wa shock
[3:40:44] <FatDragonQuest> I still haven't beaten this game on hard and it's the only thing I need to do left...
[3:40:53] <+Chimeraelite> sup peoples. How's everyone doin this late saturday
[3:40:53] <BaikenAndEggs> @mettlewolf is Pat relieved that Woolie didn't beat Dante?
[3:41:19] <vectorcannonready> Have a good night Woolie!

[3:42:00] <+TimTheChef> sbfpYeyeye
[3:42:02] <NicholasKane> YEAH
[3:42:02] <+Chimeraelite> This game is a constantly shifting puzzle and I fuckig love it
[3:42:14] <jubejube56> unfortunately it stops being good when enemies have more than 3 health
[3:42:20] <captaincarl10> I wish I could get into Into the breach but it feels too puzzley for me
[3:42:52] <ChineseNininga> I'd say block the spawn with thunder mech
[3:43:00] <NicholasKane> Hurting him doesn't matter if you don't need to use his weapon.
[3:43:05] <ChineseNininga> and with another rock
[3:43:35] <FatDragonQuest> could an into the breach board game work?
[3:43:47] <DrFacilier> id buy it
[3:43:49] <+gantz_zero> prob easily
[3:43:56] <BaikenAndEggs> @fatdragonquest easily yes.
[3:44:20] <ChineseNininga> You need a brilliant GM to set up good enemies placements tho
[3:44:24] <+paladinstarbuster> gud
[3:44:25] <Aussie_Manny> :D
[3:44:29] <+lozscat> Slow is smooth, smooth is fast

[3:44:38] <FatDragonQuest> I mean you can also use ai cards like kdm
[3:44:40] <+paladinstarbuster> yeah
[3:44:42] <NicholasKane> we've been here the whole time
[3:44:43] <jubejube56> @ChineseNininga or just do a warhamemmr-esc thing and one side takes veks
[3:44:48] <AggsMK7> Into The Bloody Palace
[3:44:49] <jubejube56> hammer*
[3:44:52] <gunstar73> See ya moth
[3:44:52] <+Okicop> less acid reflux for sure
[3:44:52] <NinjaTB> why is woolie not watching Fury vs Wilder?
[3:45:05] <+gantz_zero> who?
[3:45:20] <LucidInDarkness> rooKek
[3:45:23] <BaikenAndEggs> vergil the gerbil
[3:45:28] <DonatelloJose> YE YE YE
[3:45:32] <FatDragonQuest> Oh man the final boss is SOMETHING
[3:45:42] <ChineseNininga> ITB is fun cause the AI would always present a viable or an optimal solution to the situation
[3:45:45] <+paladinstarbuster> is that a team rocket shirt
[3:45:50] <Aussie_Manny> :D
[3:45:54] <+gantz_zero> i thought we were doing nier sidequests @WoolieVersus
[3:45:56] <+DeaconBluesClues> @woolieversus what is your favorite gaming music cover artist? Ive been relistening to a lot of moonbowmusic's chrono trigger covers
[3:45:56] <Aussie_Manny> 🤔
[3:46:29] <+Chimeraelite> it's easy Kappa
[3:46:32] <Aussie_Manny> Will do! :P
[3:46:34] <+Chimeraelite> just don't get it
[3:46:37] <OwlLightningMage> That advice also works for Fighting games
[3:46:37] <+future_ry> just hit 4Head
[3:46:38] <+lozscat> Just don't get hit
[3:46:44] <shiraihellfyre> jab is king
[3:46:45] <SilverRoddo> Do combo.
[3:46:46] <+lozscat> its that easy
[3:46:47] <fabo_joyful> Just don't take hits.
[3:46:52] <jubejube56> just click on their heads
[3:46:56] <Parapattern> Just dab a lot and you can win a match
[3:46:59] <FatDragonQuest> I mean this is just fighting games too
[3:47:04] <Aussie_Manny> So start grabbing falling leaves. Got it.
[3:47:04] <OwlLightningMage> Cool stuff makes you lose
[3:47:06] <BaikenAndEggs> @woolieversus you should ask someone to film you during training. would love to see how well you move.
[3:47:07] <LucidInDarkness> Don't get rocked
[3:47:11] <+DeaconBluesClues> footsies and cr.mk can win a match Kappa
[3:47:11] <+Chimeraelite> but seriously though, jab and maybe a cross. Gut hits are great
[3:47:20] <OwlLightningMage> Don't be cool. Cool stuff makes you lose. Be lame.
[3:47:24] <antthefool> @shiraihellfyre !!!!!
[3:47:27] <MettleWolf> Be Ippo
[3:47:33] <shiraihellfyre> hi
[3:47:33] <abowlofapplejacks> dude keeping your hands up takes more stamina than people realse
[3:47:36] <AggsMK7> And save meter for round 2
[3:47:37] <lloyddboy> ugh goos
[3:47:39] <+DaRoosta89> oh shit late ass stream
[3:47:45] <LucidInDarkness> @abowlofapplejacks Yes, yes it does
[3:47:45] <Aussie_Manny> Should I Ippo or should I Miyata? 🤔
[3:47:46] <+lozscat> SLOW IS SMOOTH, SMOOTH IS FAST
[3:47:48] <chancelovesken> Play Lame Win Games. Play Right Win Fights
[3:47:49] <BaikenAndEggs> are you an Infighter or an outfighter?
[3:47:52] <+Okicop> my coach would slap my head to remind me to keep my hands up
[3:47:52] <Fiend95> Use your V-trigger
[3:47:52] <+Chimeraelite> oh I'm aware. Same with jabbing a lot. Same with moving. It's just tiring
[3:47:56] <umm_idunno> there nothing cooler than winning
[3:48:06] <Darlington_the_Deceiver> he cheats FeelsGoodMan
[3:48:07] <+Chimeraelite> I wish I could spar more.
[3:48:10] <+Chimeraelite> HE LAMES IT OUT LUL
[3:48:10] <+gantz_zero> i literally don't know who that is
[3:48:10] <SilverRoddo> Seriously, do trunk rotations, keep your lower spine-bones not stiff.
[3:48:12] <Aussie_Manny> NOT WITH KO'S! LUL
[3:48:15] <MettleWolf> laming it out like a champ
[3:48:23] <+DeaconBluesClues> Floyd Mayweaher
[3:48:27] <MettleWolf> bop for points
[3:48:29] <+MisterTylerrr> If you're new and you know you've got good hands, sure, put your hands down and bait somebody? If you don't? PUT YOUR HANDS UP
[3:48:30] <NYCrownlessKing> Royal Guards it out
[3:48:36] <+lozscat> THATS WHY HE'S THE CHAMP
[3:48:36] <FatDragonQuest> Remember when johnny knoxxvile fought butterbean at a jewlery store
[3:48:38] <Aussie_Manny> Floyd Come-hither.
[3:48:39] <+MisterTylerrr> if you're good *
[3:49:02] <Aussie_Manny> BUT I WANNA FEEL LIKE DUDLEY THO
[3:49:08] <+Chimeraelite> until someone bops ya
[3:49:09] <gunstar73> Maywheater is a big coward
[3:49:13] <SilverRoddo> Did Floyd get charged for pushing cryptocurrency?
[3:49:18] <+Chimeraelite> rich coward though
[3:49:19] <TannerCore> Remember to bring a rose into the fight and throw it at the enemy to end/initiate a combo
[3:49:19] <lloyddboy> grapple AWAY
[3:49:20] <+bonzosan> but does he do kick thriteens?
[3:49:25] <+MisterTylerrr> Don't be Conor McGregor
[3:49:31] <+MisterTylerrr> Put your fucking hands up
[3:49:34] <+Okicop> that large goo looks kind of like a hat you'd wear @woolieversus
[3:49:37] <Darlington_the_Deceiver> Ippo prison arc soon?
[3:49:44] <abowlofapplejacks> I honestly want to be like Mike
[3:49:50] <+gantz_zero> chew some ears
[3:49:52] <abowlofapplejacks> The uppercut monster
[3:50:03] <+MisterTylerrr> Be Mike with a better Gas Tank
[3:50:10] <Aussie_Manny> I like Ike.
[3:50:14] <BaikenAndEggs> @abowlofapplejacks an infighter using the peekaboo style?
[3:50:19] <LucidInDarkness> @MisterTylerrr You say as Connor is still better than most people ever will be. It's not keep you hands up, it feel the moment out and out them up if you need to
[3:50:29] <+chaumiester> Is Woolie in Austrailia? Why is there sunlight behind him?
[3:50:40] <SilverRoddo> Learn to move like a fencer in the boxing ring to do dashes.
[3:50:42] <lloyddboy> just grapple away
[3:50:43] <BaikenAndEggs> tyson is pretty much a black Ippo with a lisp
[3:50:45] <MettleWolf> Gotta be a crazy Slugger like Mike Tyson
[3:50:48] <+Chimeraelite> it's just a ceiling light
[3:50:51] <LucidInDarkness> *put them up. That shit is tiring to always have them up
[3:50:51] <abowlofapplejacks> @BaikenAndEggs and a fast one at that
[3:50:53] <+paladinstarbuster> just a bright light
[3:50:55] <gunstar73> Just his kitchen lights
[3:50:55] <FatDragonQuest> is it viable to bite someone during boxing or is that not part of the beta
[3:51:05] <Aussie_Manny> Instructions unclear. Clinch.
[3:51:10] <gunstar73> Biting is super illegal
[3:51:12] <+lozscat> Or be like Ali if your good enough
[3:51:12] <blacksoap65> Hey chat and Woolie dogg
[3:51:32] <+MisterTylerrr> @LucidInDarkness Y'know what else is tiring? Getting knocked on your ass by one punch by a guy who doesn't box.
[3:51:41] <BaikenAndEggs> @chaumiester he's in montreal, canada. it's 11:45pm right now. it's most likely street/store lights.
[3:51:44] <SilverRoddo> Hello blacksoap, ICE to see you. mikeliveFreeze
[3:52:01] <+MisterTylerrr> You getting tired just means you need to train keeping your hands up better
[3:52:11] <ChineseNininga> DPS the Boss first
[3:52:18] <lloyddboy> woolie you can grapple the building
[3:52:30] <+gantz_zero> that's a cabinet @BaikenAndEggs
[3:52:35] <+gantz_zero> not a window
[3:52:48] <BaikenAndEggs> my bad. watching on my phone
[3:52:52] <+gantz_zero> ah
[3:52:53] <Aussie_Manny> Box the bugs.
[3:52:56] <+chaumiester> @BaikenAndEggs That's why I ask, I know he is an hour ahead of me, but it's bright as hell outside.
[3:52:57] <mcevers> why is it still light out in canada?
[3:53:09] <Aussie_Manny> It's not a window. :P
[3:53:20] <gunstar73> Do you guys not have lights in your house
[3:53:26] <illTemperedSeaBass> Ahh. Some good ol' "Into The Trolley Problem."
[3:53:27] <+gantz_zero> seriously lol
[3:53:29] <+chaumiester> OH, is that a dresser?
[3:53:34] <Aussie_Manny> Darkness is your only friend tho.
[3:53:36] <+gantz_zero> it's like a display cabinet
[3:53:50] <ChineseNininga> Rock the goo and you'll have a higher chance of chaining all the small goo down in 1 turn
[3:53:58] <+gantz_zero> which could be reflecting another light
[3:53:59] <+chaumiester> I thought it was a window this entire time. It's a display cabinet. Okay
[3:54:04] <+gantz_zero> lol
[3:54:12] <Aussie_Manny> RAW LEVEL 3 NOW!
[3:54:13] <tacostarvedbeast> Solid shirt woolz
[3:54:16] <+Okicop> I thought it was a window into his kitchen
[3:54:21] <+TimTheChef> iirc from his fightstick video it's has a light inside
[3:54:23] <+chaumiester> Same here
[3:54:36] <+paladinstarbuster> SADISTIC
[3:54:37] <BaikenAndEggs> i should add lights to my display cabinets. need to show off my guilty gear figs during night time
[3:54:39] <Aussie_Manny> P E R F E C T R I X
[3:54:42] <Terrabyte0> octo200IQ
[3:54:48] <+chaumiester> That light is so bright though, damn
[3:55:00] <+lozscat> 400 IQ PLAY
[3:55:02] <+Okicop> ohh that's his fighting stick! I thought it was the sink hahaha
[3:55:03] <Aussie_Manny> Perfectris*.
[3:55:11] <+gantz_zero> lmao
[3:55:13] <+chaumiester> I thought it was the sink too
[3:55:25] <+Okicop> it looks like a sink and the thing above it was the vent lmao
[3:55:36] <+gantz_zero> i agree, it's like reflecting another light in addition to an internal light or something
[3:55:40] <abowlofapplejacks> He's doing too well. Needs more Choas
[3:55:43] <abowlofapplejacks> chaos
[3:55:44] <+TimTheChef> it is bright af maybe he's trying his best to live in tron
[3:56:00] <lloyddboy> we're fucking under attack!
[3:56:01] <SilverRoddo> It be crazy Dark Gundam appeared.
[3:56:03] <+Toa697> everyone is here
[3:56:06] <+Okicop> there is a reflector/thing that looks like an umbrella
[3:56:25] <+MisterTylerrr> Y'all really talking about the lighting rn?
[3:56:37] <Darlington_the_Deceiver> Save Billy, he's still editing in there! Biblethump
[3:56:40] <BaikenAndEggs> it's super bright because Canada's lightbulbs are made with premium maple syrup. makes light super reflective.
[3:56:43] <+Okicop> I'm new sorry
[3:56:51] <+gantz_zero> people have concerns TYLERRR
[3:56:54] <+Okicop> and sticky
[3:56:59] <+TimTheChef> lol i'm doing homework so i havent been paying attention to the strategy too much
[3:57:04] <+chaumiester> Alright, now that I figured out the mystery of "Why is it sunlight outside Woolie's apartment. Time for bed
[3:57:05] <ChineseNininga> Get the 3 damage buggo
[3:57:05] <jotabranded> you're gonna stream Smash @WoolieVersus?
[3:57:12] <LucidInDarkness> @MisterTylerrr I guess I was speaking from a more general sense. Boxing and actually fighting are totally different things
[3:57:24] <Aussie_Manny> EVERYONE is gonna stream Smash. :P
[3:57:31] <ChineseNininga> Zap 2 blobs that are directly in front of the corporate building
[3:57:38] <NicholasKane> Use both your boys to complete the chain
[3:57:38] <MettleWolf> Platinum Gundam game, make it happen!
[3:57:49] <ChineseNininga> hook bot can then pull the mosquito away
[3:57:50] <Shisno147> hi
[3:57:56] <+Toa697> rock on small goo?
[3:58:02] <+Toa697> push big goo down one
[3:58:10] <+Okicop> woolie hat
[3:58:17] <SilverRoddo> Woolie lives in Alert, he's protecting our nation.
[3:58:21] <BaikenAndEggs> I never understood the smash hype tbh. it's a fun game to play from time to time, but I never got super into it.
[3:58:25] <+TimTheChef> I want a platinum TTGL game, that would be the shit
[3:58:34] <lautalocos> pull the slime with the tank to make a chain
[3:58:35] <Aussie_Manny> Two goos.
[3:58:39] <Aussie_Manny> 2Goos.
[3:58:46] <+lozscat> Rock go up, big goo go down
[3:59:16] <SilverRoddo> 2 Goo Dolls is my favourite band.
[3:59:53] <+lozscat> ACCEPTABLE LOSS
[4:00:11] <+DeaconBluesClues> pilots are a temporary buff OpieOP
[4:00:16] <+Toa697> that turn just sucked
[4:00:18] <MettleWolf> Does hard mode for this game have countdown times between turns?
[4:00:27] <lloyddboy> nop
[4:00:31] <antthefool> Good shit Woolie
[4:00:36] <NicholasKane> @TimTheChef did you mean The Wonderful 101?
[4:00:37] <LtThunderbolt> I would soo buy a tabletop figure of the characters
[4:00:46] <ChineseNininga> Should've burn your own pilot into crisp
[4:00:46] <+Toa697> wow the ai is awful
[4:00:51] <ChineseNininga> *shouldn't have
[4:00:53] <+lozscat> is a no pilot run possible?
[4:00:58] <LucidInDarkness> I haven't played a good board game in a long time
[4:01:12] <MettleWolf> ! Acceptable Losses !
[4:01:13] <+Toa697> a no pilot run would hurt hard late game
[4:01:18] <ChineseNininga> @lozscat yes, there's a equipment specifically for this task as well
[4:01:23] <ChineseNininga> a self destruct button
[4:01:27] <+TimTheChef> this game's music is really low key but nice
[4:01:27] <LucidInDarkness> All I feel from watching Woolie play this is the urge to find one
[4:01:32] <Aussie_Manny> Ah shit, Max is on.
[4:01:43] <LtThunderbolt> is this the blitz boys?
[4:01:53] <lloyddboy> F
[4:02:06] <BaikenAndEggs> that's it stream is over. it's an unwritten rule. can't stream at the same time as Max.
[4:02:11] <+CalamitousTea> No it's blitz ball.
[4:02:23] <gunstar73> 2 pips
[4:02:28] <lloyddboy> harold looks so tired
[4:03:01] <+TimTheChef> harold looks like he's been workin on RDR 2
[4:03:04] <MettleWolf> Woolie is already challenging the coward king Pat. Why not challenge Max too?
[4:03:10] <+lozscat> Harold is done with everyone's shit

[4:03:42] <lloyddboy> rip
[4:03:42] <BaikenAndEggs> @lucidindarkness depending on your tastes I could reccomend some. dunno when's the last time you bought a boardgame.
[4:03:43] <NicholasKane> never used it myself

[4:04:08] <BaikenAndEggs> buy the core
[4:04:08] <NicholasKane> acore over heals, friend
[4:04:27] <NicholasKane> it's not 3 power, it's 2
[4:04:29] <SilverRoddo> Don't forget to ReCore.
[4:05:38] <lloyddboy> FUCK MOUNTAINS
[4:05:39] <+Toa697> OOF

[4:07:14] <+gantz_zero> DecaFucktris
[4:07:25] <ChineseNininga> Dead
[4:07:30] <+paladinstarbuster> CCC-OMBO
[4:07:35] <jinking79> final maf
[4:07:40] <MettleWolf> I wish this game was on more systems
[4:07:41] <ChineseNininga> Pull him out
[4:07:42] <BaikenAndEggs> woolie's the real mvp
[4:07:45] <ChineseNininga> RIP
[4:07:47] <jinking79> made it to the stream
[4:07:58] <+gantz_zero> @MettleWolf that's prob the worst aspect of this game
[4:08:07] <abowlofapplejacks> its okay woolie. sacrifices must be made
[4:08:13] <ChineseNininga> No
[4:08:24] <abowlofapplejacks> You said so with peter
[4:08:56] <+gantz_zero> that was before he had pushheal man
[4:08:59] <SilverRoddo> !sr If I Can Turn Back Time
[4:09:07] <MettleWolf> Reset time "you didn't win"
[4:09:12] <+gantz_zero> could turn back time*
[4:09:38] <SilverRoddo> Ah, good call.
[4:09:52] <NicholasKane> Don't forget, the dot-dot-dot marker means that they're moving. You can force the guy to run into the water.
[4:10:22] <+Borchmoor> bitterLurk
[4:10:31] <+lozscat> don't kill harold
[4:10:35] <+gantz_zero> that advice seems to have been false @NicholasKane
[4:10:56] <SilverRoddo> Aiegh? Is that an Wilson Wilson emote?
[4:10:58] <noob_liberator> @nicholaskane Your thinking of the arrow marker
[4:11:13] <Slowchamp2> im guess were not allowed to help?
[4:11:28] <+gantz_zero> he'll choose to read when he wants to
[4:11:35] <Chichen> Woolie is galaxy braining the game he doesnt need help
[4:11:37] <lloyddboy> he doesn't look at chat often
[4:11:39] <Chichen> OpieOP
[4:11:43] <NicholasKane> fuck
[4:11:49] <NicholasKane> im's just incorrect
[4:12:02] <Wobuzhidao> Wollie is FGC, gotta learn through the Ls PogChamp
[4:12:16] <brainfromarous> Huzzah lol
[4:12:27] <+gantz_zero> o7 john
[4:12:27] <brainfromarous> Huzzah and good night
[4:12:31] <Evilkaz> I wish this game had a better aesthetic. Kinda dull tbh
[4:13:00] <+JohnMarkley> good evening all :)
[4:13:07] <Slowchamp2> have you done a perfect run on Hard before?
[4:13:17] <+JohnMarkley> hey @gantz_zero :)
[4:13:34] <SilverRoddo> mikeliveQuack Woolie is laser focused. Hello JohnMarkley, ICE to see you. mikeliveFreeze
[4:13:37] <BaikenAndEggs> @evilkaz it may not be super appealing to the eyes, but the gameplay makes up for it.
[4:13:48] <ChineseNininga> @WoolieVersus Shock, Rock, Pull mech is free to pull the mosquito away
[4:13:59] <+JohnMarkley> hi @SilverRoddo :) /
[4:14:11] <MettleWolf> This is actually entertaining to watch to see how Woollie's mind works.
[4:15:22] <Mucmaster> Shoot the guy into cloud with rock
[4:15:25] <ChineseNininga> Push it into the smoke
[4:15:57] <SilverRoddo> Woolz is basically Yami Yugi when he was learning how to play Dungeon Dice Monsters in that episode of Yugioh.
[4:16:02] <ChineseNininga> @WoolieVersus Push it into the smoke pile
[4:16:03] <NicholasKane> If you want the bonus objective, you HAVE to block twice this turn.
[4:16:04] <BaikenAndEggs> I love how Woolz gets super into the games he's playing. He may forget about the chat, but his LP skills make sure we're always entertained. + it's fun to see how the man thinks.
[4:16:05] <Slowchamp2> u could throw rock next to fly and knock him into smoke
[4:16:12] <JJCheeker> love that kirby light
[4:17:06] <ChineseNininga> Grid power is more important than perfect island
[4:17:08] <@mothmandraws> woolie you had the movement
[4:17:11] <@mothmandraws> you could have made it
[4:17:27] <Slowchamp2> i always quit if i dont get the perfect island
[4:17:30] <@mothmandraws> when you killed that bug it gave you enough spaces
[4:17:37] <+JohnMarkley> love this music
[4:17:38] <darklinksplus> man the backseat is stronk
[4:17:42] <MettleWolf> @mothmandraws it's too late. ACCEPTABLE LOSSES
[4:17:45] <+khalcipher> NT
[4:17:50] <ChineseNininga> ACCEPTABLE LOSSES
[4:18:01] <@mothmandraws> but now I actually sleep
[4:18:04] <fabo_joyful> @WoolieVersus Goodmight bro.
[4:18:17] <Mucmaster> The pull tank could of still moved :(
[4:18:23] <SilverRoddo> mikeliveSly Good Ol' Rock--nothing beats that!
[4:18:29] <@mothmandraws> ah ok
[4:18:34] <JJCheeker> gg
[4:18:44] <ChineseNininga> 2 cores to activate his skills tho
[4:18:56] <@Commando_Joe> Gn moth
[4:19:17] <MettleWolf> Rock, Paper, or Scissors?... ROCK
[4:19:42] <ChineseNininga> Train is a nightmare for zapper
[4:19:56] <NicholasKane> @Mucmaster The pull tank couldn't move, since it had already acted. (Heal/push)
[4:20:00] <ChineseNininga> along with protecting prototype bombs
[4:20:09] <Mucmaster> Oh right I'm dumb
[4:20:13] <+lozscat> Do combo?
[4:20:20] <@Commando_Joe> Is this the only grid based RPG you got into?
[4:20:44] <JJCheeker> i always go for stars
[4:20:45] <+gantz_zero> crush kill destroy
[4:20:45] <BaikenAndEggs> in Dreads vs Dreads, Woolie was able to beat Kenny (fairly easily too) but could he defeat Hellpockets?
[4:20:46] <NicholasKane> THIS FUCKING VEK HAS NO IDEA WHAT HE'S DOING
[4:20:56] <+cerass> @gantz_zero swag
[4:21:18] <tfei42> did I miss DMC4?
[4:21:23] <+gantz_zero> yes
[4:21:25] <+cerass> yup
[4:21:28] <JJCheeker> ye
[4:21:33] <MisterGrowing> @tfei42 dude your so late lol
[4:21:49] <+cerass> indubidubly
[4:21:53] <ChineseNininga> Rock the Digger so that the tiles in front of the buildings will turn into smoke
[4:21:58] <+kewlmyc> Is that light I see coming from his window? Isn't it midnight over there?
[4:21:58] <NicholasKane> Careful, can't push guys through rocks.
[4:22:08] <kuningaz45> Woolie what's your problem streaming at the same time as pat and the two of you aren't playing against/with each other
[4:22:19] <BaikenAndEggs> @kewlmyc it's a cabinet not a window.
[4:22:20] <+cerass> careful can't see chat through game
[4:22:21] <crot45> @kewlmyc might be a lamp
[4:22:29] <NicholasKane> The rock would block the hook.
[4:22:32] <ChineseNininga> @WoolieVersus you can hit the digger dead on with rock to create smoke on the digger
[4:22:33] <@Commando_Joe> He has his own life lol
[4:22:38] <Slowchamp2> woolie just wanna say im glad to see you streaming
[4:22:53] <NicholasKane> THATS RIGHT, DUNE TILES MAKE SMOKE
[4:23:03] <JJCheeker> gg
[4:23:07] <valachi> Shit nice this game came out?
[4:23:16] <NicholasKane> came out a while ago
[4:23:21] <valachi> oh man I'm dumb
[4:23:34] <JJCheeker> nno
[4:23:49] <JJCheeker> urr not
[4:23:52] <+gantz_zero> into the breach came out in february
[4:24:13] <ChineseNininga> Drop the rock on the digger, digger gets smoked
[4:24:22] <ChineseNininga> Volatile get pushed away
[4:24:26] <NicholasKane> Just shock before rock, yeah?
[4:24:40] <ChineseNininga> then you can whip that mosquito good
[4:24:47] <NicholasKane> No, yeah, volatile won't get shocked
[4:25:23] <ChineseNininga> BIG DAMAGE TO EVERYONE
[4:26:53] <+gantz_zero> omg they're both wrapping him
[4:26:58] <+gantz_zero> that's fucked up
[4:27:20] <ChineseNininga> Save the pilot or save the buildings
[4:27:31] <NicholasKane> Don't forget! The tile you throw rocks onto gets damaged, which in this case means smoke.
[4:27:32] <+paladinstarbuster> throw rock and push them
[4:28:05] <FrostySnowQueen> burn the timeline to save your boy
[4:28:09] <+driedputty> Abandon!
[4:28:12] <+gantz_zero> that's fine we know your waifu is archimedes
[4:28:16] <ChineseNininga> Do big risky move
[4:28:19] <FrostySnowQueen> your boy is more important than w/e the fuck these people are doing
[4:28:24] <ChineseNininga> Rock the volatile
[4:28:34] <ChineseNininga> He'll make it with 1 HP
[4:28:49] <ChineseNininga> and then zapper would be moved out of the way
[4:29:02] <itsya_boi_gappy> save
[4:29:04] <FrostySnowQueen> there's infinite timelines but theres only one boy
[4:29:12] <ChineseNininga> I meant rock the Volatile scorpion
[4:29:14] <ChineseNininga> Woolz
[4:29:14] <NicholasKane> Nono, hit the volatile with a rock directly.
[4:29:14] <+paladinstarbuster> the vek
[4:29:16] <+gantz_zero> queen is right
[4:29:21] <+gantz_zero> i can't disagree with that
[4:29:22] <Mucmaster> Hit the volitale with rock
[4:29:32] <ChineseNininga> @WoolieVersus I meant rock the Volatile dead on with rock mech Woolz
[4:29:33] <startstoprepeat> your boy could roll way better skills anyway, grid def + is pretty much dead weight
[4:29:47] <ChineseNininga> NO DON'T GIVE UP YET
[4:29:50] <ChineseNininga> YOU COWARD
[4:29:53] <+Great_Sage> Man, I'm reading berserk for the first time, pretty wild
[4:29:59] <+lozscat> GIVE UP

[4:30:36] <FrostySnowQueen> this is the give up squad
[4:30:36] <ithonmage> In another timeline Woolie decides to keep going, ergo....
[4:30:36] <+gantz_zero> we should just abandon timelines until we find one without Vek,imo Kappa
[4:30:37] <+mitchteck> F
[4:30:39] <ChineseNininga> @NicholasKane Acceptable losses
[4:30:43] <BaikenAndEggs> meh third strike did not exist in that timeline. so it had to go.

[0:17:19] <captainthunderwolf> This is a weird take, but I'll find it genuinely unnerving if the Lickers have buttholes but none of the zombie dogs do, given that Japanese devs always give dogs buttholes and it would be really insidious for only the Lickers to have b-holes.

[0:42:03] <stubbyharbinger2u> @pikebot the game is for controllers I'd go for Ps4 dude

[0:42:20] <low_hell_key> yup that's what i did
[0:42:20] <+HoloToast> Pat is right though
[0:42:22] <+ORGANizerC> pat helpful as always
[0:42:23] <+legendfather_of_giants> keyboard is not fantastic here
[0:42:24] <lloyddboy> there's some sick m+kb runs out there
[0:42:24] <%fFailureatlife> imagine playing a 3rd person game with a mouse
[0:42:24] <SomeDwarf> PC is the best version because of the 10,000 FPS red hot knife
[0:42:25] <Youwereeatenbyalid> fuckyourself pat

[0:42:27] <+SirFailsAlott> play with m+kb it's so much better
[0:42:27] <Ballthios> I prefer controller, but keyboard + mouse seems fine
[0:42:28] <$Superdandy96> I agree
[0:42:30] <AgentTexes> Pc with KB&M
[0:42:30] <PayneBlackNG> i mean, that'd be the best way
[0:42:30] <low_hell_key> i played on the pc with a switch pro controller
[0:42:34] <+Muzzle131> the nintendo SWITCH DUH
[0:42:34] <+reiju_22> quicksave monkaS
[0:42:37] <Alien3isTopTier> Pat is correct
[0:42:38] <%RioGascar> This game is awful on KB&M
[0:42:38] <stubbyharbinger2u> play on the game cube with a sandwich
[0:42:39] <+thebonebard> i actually was going to recommend pc with controller, i think controller adds a fun level of difficulty
[0:42:42] <eddiemayfly> You should play on the Switch with a Famicom controller.
[0:42:44] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Play it with a Playstation Move
[0:42:47] <MrScottKennedy> This pace is perfect because I can go check on my food and not miss anything.

[0:42:49] <+furiousfurioso> hey gang has Mr X shown up yet?
[0:42:49] <+pyl3> Just got here. Has Woolie get his ass eaten my dogs yet?
[0:42:52] <%laserbeaming> Don't listen to Pat, do the Mouse and Keyboard like a civilized person
[0:42:54] <Laironx3> use a Guitar Hero guitar controller
[0:42:55] <natebud> make your flashlight flicker or something you can barely notice

[0:43:07] <reinbachthe3rd> Play it on Steam with a Guitar Hero controller.
[0:43:07] <+Jetsfantasy> I play controller for most of the game, but switch to KB/M for doggos or challenge modes
[0:43:09] <+Muzzle131> @furiousfurioso His arm did

[0:43:25] <+Tyler_Ruins_Games> It's barely a puzzle

[1:07:08] <The_Introspector> And put the electronic part away
[1:07:08] <%Th3SmartAlec> When you shove it in a person, uh hih
[1:07:12] <low_hell_key> @Guardiansaiyan GOD DAMMIT
[1:07:16] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> PAT WAS WRONG
[1:07:16] <%DirtyGaijin> @ArtThouBored You mean Montreal?
[1:07:19] <captainthunderwolf> A flashbang going off in anyone's mouth should fucking KILL them, by the way.
[1:07:19] <unlimited_osteopath> are they in Woolie's house? Why is Pat absorbing that couch??
[1:07:20] <Guardiansaiyan> @ArtThouBored Remake 3 should have it since it spans the city unlike RE2
[1:07:23] <captainthunderwolf> That is a GRENADE, dude.
[1:07:23] <timetraveller2000> Encumbrance is the cause of all our problems Kappa
[1:07:23] <ranarath> @AgentTexes Stupidity. The C-virus
[1:07:24] <ahbhajit> the delay when you put the grenade in is so you can shoot it for more potent boom
[1:07:26] <Graxe_> Man, if Woolie had to deal with Ink Ribbons on top of all of this like the old games.
[1:07:26] <stubbyharbinger2u> 6 is where Leon is a mopey boring twat
[1:07:26] <Jarvanii> dogs react the same was as people when you shove one in them
[1:07:27] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> You only need the knife
[1:07:27] <scrubviewer> woolie too many items

[1:07:29] <+crown_clown22> Pat tell woolie to use the key pls
[1:07:35] <ArtThouBored> I want the Forest and Mansion included in the layout
[1:07:38] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @captainthunderwolf yeah you know what else should kill them? BULLETS
[1:07:42] <%itsjustdoogan> I be back, bring back COOKIES
[1:07:43] <Corporate_Redeemer> Shooting them will affect multiple but letting them detonating on their own will only affect the one enemy
[1:07:46] <$Superdandy96> I can’t believe Pat and Woolie live in a Alt reality Raccoon City
[1:07:47] <+nitsuji94> store the fucking key
[1:07:47] <StrangeCoincidence> What do you get when Pat and Woolie fusion? "Poolie"? "Wat"?
[1:07:48] <KingVantq> @AgentTexes its set after 5 is all i remember

[1:08:06] <stubbyharbinger2u> @bardicfire no
[1:08:06] <captainthunderwolf> @Youwereeatenbyalid Not wrong, but a flashbang would literally remove their head, which is more of the idea.
[1:08:07] <+Answer_Moose> @bardicfire that'd be neat
[1:08:11] <Guardiansaiyan> @FrustratedAF he didn't tell him for our amusement
[1:08:14] <possumwalsh1221> Dump everything but knife

[1:50:45] <Andrade9T> if passwords with numbers and letters are so safe why does padlocks just have one or the other ?
[1:50:45] <majindusto> lol Wouldn't have it any other way
[1:50:45] <captainthunderwolf> @WoolieVersus It might only be faster if Leon's in a damaged state and limping.

[1:53:02] <%Muzzle131> it was an art museum
[1:53:03] <Corporate_Redeemer> @kitsunemanami Because the game randomizes the amount of ammo you get based on your performance. Woolie is doing really poorly in combat and wastes ammo, thus the game inflates the number of bullets he gets
[1:53:03] <The_Introspector> You can't miss X unless you glitch the game.
[1:53:05] <%QueequegTheater> @Sitinomi But Woolie still hasn't opened the car trunk tho Kappa
[1:53:05] <%Th3SmartAlec> Puzzle time
[1:53:07] <natebud> That's why the saves are 400 MB Kappa

[1:53:12] <+Jukku> I work for a fire dept and we have a linen room. when you have bunks you have to be able to do the laundry
[1:53:14] <nobknee> @WoolieVersus Hey Pat, tell Woolie to give KOTOR 2 on steam a look. I won't expect him to stream it, I just think he'd enjoy it. And the steam version is great, full of modern updates, resolutions, steam workshop, et cetera.
[1:53:16] <jessicaamado> Green is not a creative color PAT morfDerp
[1:53:22] <dsauce999> Man those 400 mB saves tho

[1:56:29] <ScreamingMeat> I guess Woolie doesn't wanna save keys in the box so he can look at them anymore
[1:56:29] <Plutt_bug> This is his first day
[1:56:30] <%Muzzle131> this is all happening in one night too
[1:56:32] <%QueequegTheater> @puhff When in doubt, it was Wesker
[1:56:32] <majindusto> Leon's Bad Day
[1:56:33] <%ChoculaUltra> future "door is locked" prompts should be replaced with the player character just cursing under his breath
[1:56:36] <possumwalsh1221> Oh he’d be dead as shit
[1:56:40] <rytisone> remember kids, always be late
[1:56:40] <ArtThouBored> He'd die on the first bad day
[1:56:43] <Juriisbestwaifu> @itsjustdoogan you mean for Claire?
[1:56:46] <$Superdandy96> @itsjustdoogan are you crazy? Do you want Claire to hunt for him too? Kappa
[1:56:47] <The_Introspector> Woolie memory don't work so well when under pressue.
[1:56:47] <ManfredA> remember Jill is still here after RE2 is over
[1:56:47] <mr_hunter> know what i mean?
[1:56:48] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Know what I mean
[1:56:49] <nobknee> @WoolieVersus Hey Pat, tell Woolie to give KOTOR 2 on steam a look. I won't expect him to stream it, I just think he'd enjoy it. And the steam version is great, full of modern updates, resolutions, steam workshop, et cetera.
[1:56:51] <%itsjustdoogan> yes
[1:56:51] <+8framelag> the safe room
[1:56:52] <%DirtyGaijin> Leon would have tried to be the Hero and died
[1:56:53] <Gruhunchously> @ChoculaUltra Isn't that already a thing?
[1:56:55] <GrieverRexxIII> wheres wesker?
[1:56:59] <Acidshocker> 203
[1:57:01] <+connos_livereview> i dunno leon is pretty powerful
[1:57:01] <ArtThouBored> He'd trust a person turning into a zombie and then get bit
[1:57:07] <JetpackMcQuack> Leon's protagonist powers are strong though
[1:57:14] <WanderingSwordsman> Did Mr X showed up?
[1:57:19] <%DirtyGaijin> not yet
[1:57:19] <Plutt_bug> 4 1 3
[1:57:20] <banjokazumi> I wonder if Leon can do sick front flips out of windows at this point in the lore
[1:57:21] <+connos_livereview> even in rookie form
[1:57:22] <%itsjustdoogan> not yet
[1:57:22] <%QueequegTheater> @WanderingSwordsman No

[1:57:35] <TheNewJapanGuy> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[1:57:36] <5ivves> I like the idea that Leon would actually be really shitty at his job, so this kinda worked out.
[1:57:39] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> More slots
[1:57:39] <ManfredA> do you think Leon would be instant STARS material in a delayed outbreak scenario
[1:57:40] <majindusto> BREAK these LOCKERS OPEN!!!

[1:59:32] <CerberusDriver> Reuben's tweet about 'almost missing the DMC5 launch party' what a guy
[1:59:34] <$Superdandy96> Re2 and Re3 happen around the same time right?
[1:59:35] <nobknee> How come Capcom always wants to change the faces of their characters? You'd think they'd just have Leon look like a younger version of himself in RE4 for RE2 remake.
[1:59:35] <DirtyPopcornJ> @ThatGuyfromMars Budget cuts? If that actually WAS a feature, that would make that keypad cost MORE. Then again, Irons and Umbrella so I wouldn't be surprised.

[2:35:51] <Jalexster> X himself is not that dangerous. The primary danger he causes is making you run into stuff that you'd otherwise deal with in a calmer manner.
[2:35:51] <%invisi_bliss> DMX is out of prison but he's comin for U

[2:36:36] <%Th3SmartAlec> @xXichibanballer "Let's speed this up shall we?"
[2:36:37] <ManfredA> X's danger is also just being an unknown factor in a situation you're comfortable with

[2:41:32] <+itssunderland> He moves faster because you shot his hat off
[2:41:33] <Corporate_Redeemer> sbfpScared
[2:41:34] <+BaronBattle> @ManfredA as long as you're running. if you walk he can't hear it as far
[2:41:34] <+tigerfang86> he moves with RESOLVE
[2:41:34] <+legendfather_of_giants> he does thp
[2:41:35] <ToastyBroDude> YES HE DOES
[2:41:37] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Just like Wesker
[2:41:38] <ArtThouBored> Not yet
[2:41:38] <Graxe_> @WoolieVersus He can hear every shot you make and every door you slam open, along with your footsteps.
[2:41:38] <dukenux> Kappa
[2:41:39] <The_Introspector> He doesn't run, but he walks quite fast.
[2:41:39] <Youwereeatenbyalid> He's got CLONES
[2:41:40] <+badchoice5> Every step you take Woolz. Every move you make. Every breath you take, He'll be watching you.
[2:41:42] <%mzrx7> not teleporting, until he does
[2:41:42] <BelMadness> He definitely teleports tho
[2:41:42] <+Grayhammatter> he's moving, WITH purpose
[2:41:43] <+SkaNinja> he is coming for that booty
[2:41:43] <ZetaPulse> sometimes
[2:41:44] <zafooru> he is ZAAPPINGG

[2:41:47] <Supmotto> he teleports when you get the jack
[2:41:47] <+Twichty> Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
[2:41:48] <ManfredA> @Ellie_Eyegore kinda actually, he can hear runs and slammed doors, shots, and enemies being triggered even
[2:41:48] <scrubviewer> imagine if he runs like nemesis
[2:41:48] <xavior1993> only if you are far away
[2:41:50] <sislord> he kinda teleports
[2:41:51] <Gigigear21 > Q U I C K B O I

[2:41:56] <+gael_jebidibah> He's using the zapping system
[2:41:58] <+legendfather_of_giants> he does teleport if youre far away
[2:42:01] <%tank7013> He does teleport but you've gotta get real far away first
[2:42:01] <royalxblood> NO DETAIL
[2:42:01] <majindusto> NEMESIS would be BONKERS
[2:42:03] <Metii_Morst> not "technically" teleporting. he's still moving at extremely fast speed when you're not in an adjacent room
[2:42:04] <%Muzzle131> imagine Mr X with the Ai of the xenomorph from Isolation
[2:42:05] <%Keyd00d> nope LUL
[2:42:05] <SunsetJack> I thought he teleported when Max played on hardcore?
[2:42:07] <BelMadness> Motherfucker, stop lying. He fucking teleports.
[2:42:08] <eddiemayfly> Mr X never teleports. Now, at certain points, after certain triggers are triggered, a second Mr X temporarily spawns in.
[2:42:10] <Ner234> Does Pat know about the bug where TWO Mr. X can spawn?
[2:42:11] <zdracpr> Can someone hook me up with a 2k19 twitch prime code Pleasee
[2:42:11] <ScreamingMeat> @WoolieVersus It is possible to hide from in areas where you have no flashlight out. I was able to loose him in the library
[2:42:11] <%s_xylocalsingles> woolieLORE
[2:42:12] <umm_idunno> he teleports for scripted stuff
[2:42:12] <+generalve> STOMP STOMP STOMP STOMP
[2:42:14] <timetraveller2000> X with the speed run tech. Liam would be proud.
[2:42:14] <ManfredA> he only teleports at scripted points
[2:42:14] <OkamiDude15> he hears the sound of your cheeks clapping cuz leons dummy thick
[2:42:16] <+PenmanLupine> GPS rounds weren't a thing in '98
[2:42:17] <@Solidus_113> @Guardiansaiyan I don't need to, I'm downloading the VOD and editing it for WoolieVersus
[2:42:17] <%Th3SmartAlec> Dire and Straizo
[2:42:17] <sislord> nemesis would be broken

[2:42:21] <DeepPix3l> Just put a big fat X on the floor he's on
[2:42:24] <PSI_Guy95> I'd love to just have a spectator cam and see how Mr. X tries to track you down
[2:42:27] <%QueequegTheater> ( ͠° ͟🔴 ͡°) OvErClOwNfIdEnCe Is A sLoW aNd HiLaRiOuS KiLlEr ( ͠° ͟🔴 ͡°)
[2:42:27] <+in_spaaace> He does not teleport it spawns another Mr.X for scripted sequences
[2:42:29] <TheNewJapanGuy> He technically does teleport
[2:42:32] <MyNameIsRasus> THE INVINCIBLE KICK
[2:42:33] <mayorrev> you already have a GPS it's called STOMP STOMP STOMP
[2:42:35] <+TomServal> @eddiemayfly That's amazing, he calls in a double.

[2:42:51] <bardicfire> REmake 3 with a meandering Dark Souls like Open City Map and Nemesis always on your ass.
[2:42:52] <Kghaleon> He's scary until you see the nemesis mod

[2:43:13] <BelMadness> >walks at snail pace >"no he doesnt teleport tho" fuck outta town
[2:43:15] <+RelaxedPizza> DMX, Professor X and Tyrant are the only three Mr. Xs
[2:43:16] <@mothmandraws> Mod to let him mood in pauses

[2:43:23] <Apocalypse1950> NO. That was proven to be a hoax.
[2:43:23] <+badchoice5> When a Mr X and a Mrs X love each other VERY much
[2:43:24] <ashuckel> the difference between pat's runthrough and woolies is just astonishing
[2:43:25] <+YouGotCheddared> Mr X is gonna give me a phobia of big huge bald men

[2:44:06] <+ThatGuyfromMars> oh man I hope the surprise happens here
[2:44:07] <sileo_patronus> Pat likes the word outrageous
[2:44:07] <%QueequegTheater> Mr. XXX

[2:44:36] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Looks like a combination
[2:44:37] <%tank7013> Hey look another room that makes Leon A make no sense
[2:44:37] <+badchoice5> Time is stopped, but remember, Mr X is even stronger than TIME ITSELF
[2:44:40] <+zeiss_schreiber> @YouGotCheddared He only push them aside

[2:45:17] <scrubviewer> go back upstairs where he wonders around
[2:45:22] <%Th3SmartAlec> "What does this mean!?"
[2:45:23] <MyNameIsRasus> In time, you will know the tragic extent of Umbrella's failures...
[2:45:26] <BelMadness> Pat should just say X can be killed so Woolie wastes what few bullets he has left
[2:45:26] <%ChoculaUltra> Justin Hanson, the boldest thief in the RE universe ever?
[2:45:26] <+khalcipher> Emote jail is the best tho

[2:46:49] <OkamiDude15> @Tyler_Ruins_Games showing off his gams
[2:46:50] <%Ion_LaserX> he really want dat book
[2:46:50] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Did Pat tell Woolie that Mr.X can hear you running and when you use ammo, yet?

[2:46:53] <@mothmandraws> moobot is real and im the ai
[2:47:00] <%Muzzle131> trapped
[2:47:06] <gustavozxd> the fact that you can hear him stomp around the save room LUL
[2:47:07] <%Keyd00d> fake room?
[2:47:08] <+Twichty> suddenly u hear a faint uttering in a deep tone ... " Stars"
[2:47:10] <dukenux> throw away that shit
[2:47:13] <ManfredA> this room is fun in Claire's route
[2:47:13] <%itsjustdoogan> Traps are gay
[2:47:16] <spinningchurro> Pat using chat as a crutch to pretend he has perfect knowledge of the game. DONT THINK I DIDNT NOTICE PAT
[2:47:20] <Juriisbestwaifu> ass was pounded too hard that he was bleeding
[2:47:22] <%QueequegTheater> @itsjustdoogan So what
[2:47:23] <+Omegaanimus> Where are the zombies who were zombie fetishists and look like they were REALLY excited when they got killed?
[2:47:26] <Plutt_bug> This is a weird Claire skin
[2:47:29] <scrubviewer> tipping stomp man intensifies
[2:47:30] <The_Butterfly_Man> I thought he was going to go use the car key earlier?
[2:47:32] <+RadiantBurrito> @itsjustdoogan That's what makes them so good 👀
[2:47:32] <possumwalsh1221> Pat the cheater
[2:47:34] <MarylandJutsu> @itsjustdoogan heres that attention you ordered
[2:47:35] <@Solidus_113> Kool Aid Man memes should come back
[2:47:36] <+Tyler_Ruins_Games> Now just calmly proceed through the station, obviously.
[2:47:37] <sislord> knock knock
[2:47:42] <%QueequegTheater> @The_Butterfly_Man LUL
[2:47:43] <+8framelag> this is what's left of zapping rip
[2:47:45] <ishotmattday> massively cool
[2:47:47] <%tank7013> So chat what do you think the over-under is on those busted walls in the shower area being Nemesis?
[2:47:47] <The_Introspector> Only one way out.
[2:47:47] <+DeaconBluesClues> @Omegaanimus at the con 4 blocks over
[2:47:50] <timetraveller2000> If X had a catchphrase what would it be? I think it would be “...” Kappa
[2:47:52] <%FriendStaffen> Man it sure would suck if Mr. X came down that hallway wouldn't it
[2:47:53] <%itsjustdoogan> yay
[2:47:55] <%Muzzle131> it's super worth it!
[2:47:59] <+Omegaanimus> that should be a raid mode itself
[2:47:59] <%Ion_LaserX> @Solidus_113 that'll probably happen when RE3 Remake comes out
[2:47:59] <ToastyBroDude> @spinningchurro He asked chat for help before remembering something, so he isn't trying to look smart
[2:48:02] <JetpackMcQuack> That room is just red now
[2:48:03] <%DashXero> Did Woolie ever check out the parking lot again?
[2:48:04] <+legendfather_of_giants> @tank7013 almost guaranteed
[2:48:05] <Derkinstacker> It makes the room red, it's worth it.
[2:48:07] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> The waiting room is worth it.
[2:48:10] <spinningchurro> @solidus_113 Hey man thanks for all your work. Appreciate the compilations.
[2:48:12] <ManfredA> @timetraveller2000 he has one. Mr. X can taunt you in this game, for real
[2:48:12] <+Jaegen16> It's worth it with Woolie's aim.
[2:48:15] <%shockzndrawe> @Solidus_113 CoolX Man, filled to the brim with delicious delicious T Virus
[2:48:16] <ishotmattday> cool
[2:48:16] <The_Introspector> Mr.X doesn't enter dead end rooms.

[3:19:09] <%priceyyeti40> seemsgood100 Decided to join on the fun and start my own Leon A run to go along with you guys. I've had an S plus since Woolie got the Magnum
[3:19:09] <scrubviewer> capcom hates rebbeca they put her latest apparence is a shomitty movie
[3:19:09] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Blonde Jill is probably sterile. That's why Chris wants Leon's seed for Claire
[3:19:13] <The_Introspector> X doesn't go into dead end rooms.
[3:19:14] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Lets be honest Woolie, this game is actually kind of boring to watch people play when they're good a it
[3:19:15] <%tank7013> Best Jill is Marvel 2 Jill
[3:19:16] <majindusto> Older Rebecca from Vendetta is Hot!!!

[3:33:58] <%Ion_LaserX> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[3:33:58] <sislord> is this an actual thing?
[3:33:59] <+theKingRamses> you did it car key
[3:34:00] <Gruhunchously> Now you can waste ammo more efficiently.
[3:34:00] <+koudellka255> Sometimes when i watch virtual Youtuber Kizuna AI play REmake 2 i think to myself aww shes doing her best but i dont think anyone can be worse than her...
[3:34:00] <zwilliams07> The police cars are tiny.
[3:34:01] <+legendfather_of_giants> @WoolieVersus supposed to get that first
[3:34:02] <Panquake25> BIG BURST
[3:34:03] <@mothmandraws> stock here lvl 2
[3:34:04] <Dragonborn983> The numbers don't lie and they spell disaster for you at the RPD
[3:34:04] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Literally hours ago
[3:34:04] <godzookylives> RE4 Matilda
[3:34:04] <ManfredA> no it's super good for woolie aim

[3:34:05] <+michingmallecho> Feel Matilda apatSmug
[3:34:05] <artoflec> oh man im watching a video of the shooting aftermath, hit the seat he was in but didnt go all the way through
[3:34:06] <OkamiDude15> @MementoExtasis he tried it as a one of on the sbfp channel
[3:34:07] <count_bob> W = 6.667
[3:34:08] <dreu81> Finally
[3:34:09] <Fujiwara_92> W*3
[3:34:11] <+lag2993> lol no doogos left
[3:34:12] <majindusto> BURST
[3:34:14] <Coliaki> it just wastes ammo honestly
[3:34:14] <HiddenPorpoise> "The ATF duckcall"
[3:34:17] <+BopBeep> Important to note you can still fire a single shot @WoolieVersus
[3:34:17] <+reiju_22> 3 wasted bullets instead of one
[3:34:19] <%Th3SmartAlec> No it's not the dog solver. Running is dog solver.
[3:34:19] <Graxe_> But is it worth the extra slot? That's your call.
[3:34:20] <+Tyler_Ruins_Games> It's not that good LUL
[3:34:23] <TheA1ternative> 3w*10= 20 means w=2/3
[3:34:24] <Matufreak> the stock actually improves damage
[3:34:24] <A_Classy_Gentleman> Hey all! fifiHug
[3:34:26] <%sukiyakiwestern> ITS FINE
[3:34:27] <eddiemayfly> 3 bullets per pull of the trigger X Woolie factor = over 9000
[3:34:27] <joylent_blue> artoflec for real, he was so close to getting hit
[3:34:27] <+8framelag> would've could've
[3:34:28] <illogik01> NAH NOT THE WAY YOU SHOOT WOOLIE
[3:34:28] <+generalve> NERF GUN
[3:34:29] <+SPKTR34> that's a totally legal gun
[3:34:31] <ToastyBroDude> @Tyler_Ruins_Games It's fucking amazing
[3:34:32] <CptBritches> It's not worth the extra slot at all
[3:34:33] <%QueequegTheater> It's literally a bump stock
[3:34:33] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[3:34:34] <elspiceweasel> waste 3x the bullets, hooray!
[3:34:34] <+Maids4lyfe> LUL

[3:34:34] <Duke_of_HI> LUL
[3:34:35] <%Ion_LaserX> LUL
[3:34:36] <SomeDwarf> You can still shoot only one bullet as long as you don't depress the trigger fully
[3:34:36] <DapperDan83> function over fashion
[3:34:36] <SixthSun2> LUL
[3:34:37] <+itssunderland> Serpentining is the doglem solver
[3:34:39] <lethallylactic> Jebaited
[3:34:40] <+fizzguy47> i put the stock away
[3:34:40] <ManfredA> BIG GUNS FOR BIG BOYS
[3:34:40] <DigbyMayor> Multiply that by W

[3:34:42] <Laecerelius> Leon is full of two-slot guns
[3:34:43] <%yuribo26> ITS RED 9 ALL OVER
[3:34:44] <Youwereeatenbyalid> SUPRISE MOTHERFUCKER
[3:34:44] <timetraveller2000> Honestly, Matilda is the worst gun DansGame
[3:34:45] <$BioStormX> One miss = 3 bullets now
[3:34:45] <Matufreak> the stock adds damage
[3:34:47] <Corporate_Redeemer> ATTACHE CASE HD
[3:34:47] <Palmtuna> Wouldn't 3 shots per fire be a waste of ammo?
[3:34:49] <+tigerfang86> FANCY ASS
[3:34:50] <sislord> its not that important
[3:34:50] <The_Introspector> Clunky bitch.
[3:34:51] <Amperture> Take it off sipGasm
[3:34:51] <+LoganPayne> "I can take it off, though" -Woolie 2019

[3:34:53] <Graxe_> That's the RE4 Matilda.
[3:34:54] <KiraKamixephos> I keep it off
[3:34:54] <%sukiyakiwestern> you have so much inventory woolie jeez
[3:34:54] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Looks ugly, but makes it more useful.
[3:34:54] <natebud> looks great without the muzzle brake and extended
[3:34:55] <count_bob> Don't you dare take that off Woolie.
[3:34:56] <+generalve> NERF RPD EDITION Kappa
[3:34:56] <+DeaconBluesClues> appearantly it's a realyl shitty gun with terrible aim on automatic mode
[3:34:57] <SomeDwarf> @Palmtuna You don't have to shoot all 3
[3:34:57] <+Chimeraelite> If it works it works fam
[3:34:59] <+x24sonic> gun that looks like mr t
[3:35:00] <banjokazumi> Illegal now
[3:35:01] <HyperionXV> It can still fire single shots if you tap fire
[3:35:01] <ManfredA> @Palmtuna it's your choice, you hold the button to fire more
[3:35:02] <xavior1993> you can take it off?
[3:35:03] <scrubviewer> that legit
[3:35:03] <%DashXero> Bullpup rifles are kinda cool.
[3:35:03] <+enterprise900> One of the earliest modern machine pistols
[3:35:04] <Gruhunchously> Rifle envy
[3:35:07] <PSI_Guy95> Not as good as Silenced Pistol with an underbarrel grenade launcher
[3:35:07] <%Muzzle131> but claire get's a cool gun
[3:35:08] <+Griffin1171> Pistols are cooler tho
[3:35:08] <mayorrev> NO SHUT UP THOUGH
[3:35:08] <+magusdraco> @WoolieVersus it does more damage with the stabilizer on
[3:35:08] <+TheHeroAppears> put the scope on it
[3:35:09] <Phob05> Carbine
[3:35:09] <+Reizie_Etherealm> A skorpion is smaller than that
[3:35:12] <+atwitchical> @BioStormX nah, you don't have to shoot all 3
[3:35:13] <+Hamblasto> I just realized Woolie doesn't have a shotgun for upcoming stuff
[3:35:14] <volraths_bane> Megatron got that
[3:35:14] <tungstenviper> Cause a rilfe is heavy LUL
[3:35:15] <Pappajimbo> forgotten weapons on youtube does a video that shows how the stock works
[3:35:15] <Corporate_Redeemer> BECAUSE WE CAN, PAT
[3:35:15] <+tigerfang86> SHUT UP THOUGH ITS MY GUN
[3:35:16] <%sukiyakiwestern> VP70 is a historically terrible and stupid gun
[3:35:17] <megaminimechamocha> But Pat then you can't fire it in that dumb way from Sicario
[3:35:18] <$TRILLTURBAN> bc it's cheap
[3:35:20] <%yeknomlive> imagine a tank with just a handgun sticking out of it
[3:35:21] <turbofolk> Revolver ocelot Line of thinking
[3:35:21] <The_Introspector> Watching Woolie play RE2 makes me wish for nuclear winter... jk.

[3:35:21] <dukenux> aww i like stock
[3:35:23] <+PenmanLupine> I miss Ada FeelsBadMan

[3:35:28] <orphancrippler_> get the speed cocker attachment
[3:35:28] <+Jukku> VP70 is cool but not that great
[3:35:29] <+Ninestempest> Will woolie ever stream faster than 720p30fps
[3:35:31] <+Svanyr> All hail Gun Jesus and his disciple karl
[3:35:35] <+BorinCorran> Pat are you really going to complain about a pistol stock when you worship the Red9 so much? For real real?
[3:35:37] <+8framelag> sunken cost fallacy
[3:35:37] <%Ion_LaserX> @PenmanLupine We all miss Ada

[3:43:10] <+Vivaciousx3> ada is the best

[3:43:11] <megaminimechamocha> Ada wait
[3:43:12] <Kghaleon> Mods turn on emotes when nothing is happening, take it off when actual story happens. Amaze.
[3:43:12] <Scorian> Claire is better DansGame
[3:43:14] <Sphincter_Spelunker> She's a cunt

[3:43:17] <+Maids4lyfe> there was a bomb not a spark
[3:43:18] <%shockzndrawe> I get the idea of setting chat to emote only is to prevent people from spoiling things like when X shows up, but if you only do it whenever He shows up it still becomes a signal that he's going to show up. It's ultimately pointless.
[3:43:18] <Dingo_Eejit> BURNING HOT!
[3:43:19] <mrjohncarlton> Stay away from her Leon! You have to fuck Claire!
[3:43:20] <sislord> ADA SAVE ME FROM CHRIS

[3:50:54] <Cameoun570> It won’t let me cheer hep plz
[3:50:55] <Shockmaster182> What if resident evil is just anti vaxxer propaganda
[3:50:55] <xbb1024> I thought Kendo killed himself
[3:50:57] <Bloogoose> Its supposed to be ambiguous
[3:50:58] <rytisone> Save the City. Just not this one
[3:50:59] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> GHOST SURVIVOR
[3:50:59] <faegbeard> He lined it up real good.
[3:51:03] <%PoopyDickens> ALL COPS ARE BASTARDS 🏴

[3:51:10] <OkamiDude15> he got that 2 for one shot
[3:51:11] <+Ellie_Eyegore> I'm not because it leaves in question whether he shot his daughter or himself
[3:51:11] <%QueequegTheater> @xbb1024 Nope. BibleThump
[3:51:12] <+8framelag> Kendo escapes alive
[3:51:13] <CareBear420> maybe He use knife?
[3:51:13] <Taffer85> kendo lives Kappa
[3:51:13] <sislord> WHY YOU LYING
[3:51:14] <gustavozxd> and when he talks to claire its the most hilarious shit
[3:51:16] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ohh
[3:51:16] <ManfredA> Ghost Survivors is explicitly noncanon
[3:51:18] <breakerdsx> He designed Barrys MUGNUM
[3:51:18] <TheAmazingClaytor> Gotta Secure Contain Protect the city
[3:51:19] <%CubicPhantom> best theme
[3:51:21] <+tigerfang86> WHAT IF
[3:51:22] <tungstenviper> @WoolieVersus Kendo is the creator of the Smurai Edge
[3:51:24] <%Muzzle131> what if
[3:51:25] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> except Ghost still dies in his DLC LUL
[3:51:27] <timetraveller2000> It’s especially weird considering he’s canonically dead
[3:51:27] <Guardiansaiyan> @Shockmaster182 Wesker and villians, and heroes are all about vacinines...anti vax is not research
[3:51:29] <+wizkid50000> My theory is he couldn't kill his daughter so he just kills himself
[3:51:30] <PayneBlackNG> Don't forget his fucking AWESOME song Kreygasm
[3:51:34] <KeiPrime> it was kendo's brother, who made the samurai edge
[3:51:34] <%fatal_penguin_> Show us your Feet, guys
[3:51:35] <megaminimechamocha> Noooo Kendo is alive in my canon, Pat!

[3:51:45] <Shwepie> Leon will save the city by leveling it with a nuke.
[3:51:45] <firmlygraspi1> that explains my burning flesh
[3:51:45] <captainthunderwolf> @wizkid50000 That would explain where the DLC begins.
[3:51:45] <eddiemayfly> The best line in the whole game
[3:51:45] <tyrano_the_wise> where are you?
[3:51:45] <+TransporterX7> God Leon's VA is OOF
[3:51:46] <CurrySauseBandit> Naaaw Leon
[3:51:46] <OkamiDude15> the greatest line read

[3:51:50] <low_hell_key> fucking lve that line

[3:51:53] <+8framelag> ludonarrative
[3:51:53] <ManfredA> Marvin deserves his own mini-campaign
[3:51:55] <Matufreak> I love that line
[3:51:55] <copyritetm> but its odd since kendo doesnt die at all in this game
[3:51:55] <ArtThouBored> Sometimes this voicework is RE2 levels
[3:51:55] <Guardiansaiyan> The City can be SAVED
[3:51:56] <happyface699> And there stupid trial runs
[3:51:57] <+JackMillerTime> isnt gene editing becoming a real thing
[3:51:57] <+AFrostyCookie> @wizkid50000 Thats actually kinda cool and I didnt think of that

[3:52:10] <%SailingSaturn> or he will cirTan
[3:52:10] <%Ion_LaserX> Capcom better get union actors for the RE3 Remake

[3:52:24] <b1gboss007> No he Isn't :(
[3:52:25] <+Tyler_Ruins_Games> Kendo MUST DIE
[3:52:25] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Outbreak is Canon Kreygasm
[3:52:26] <captainthunderwolf> What about Mr X's HAT, Pat???
[3:52:26] <$ooblagis> And Jill
[3:52:27] <%IDTheftVictim> Just kinda rephrases it
[3:52:27] <+Grayhammatter> big nuked
[3:52:27] <CptBritches> It is a confirm. The DLC literally says "what if" they lived
[3:52:29] <FancyHatMan> U DON KNOW NOTHIN D:
[3:52:30] <+generalve> outbreak is not canon
[3:52:30] <TheHamwall125> The "4th" survivor
[3:52:31] <SomeDwarf> @WoolieVersus Just for reference Woolie the other two Ghost Survivors are 100% dead confirmed and canon
[3:52:31] <sislord> except leon fucking claire. oh wait
[3:52:32] <%Muzzle131> Hunk is good though
[3:52:32] <Kghaleon> He'll be in RE3, shows what you know Pat.
[3:52:33] <%xXichibanballer> those people didn't make it out
[3:52:34] <KeystoneA1> Outbreak is cool
[3:52:34] <Rellim80> But Emma COULD be a new Protag
[3:52:35] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @JackMillerTime Super frowned upon. Any mistakes made can affect future generations and the human race as a whole o.o
[3:52:35] <thehoboacrossts> Rita lived
[3:52:36] <%SailingSaturn> Except John the Scientist has no Girlfriend cirSlain
[3:52:37] <+tigerfang86> maybe LUL
[3:52:37] <@mothmandraws> hunk made it
[3:52:37] <%Th3SmartAlec> Even the online one had some contradictions
[3:52:37] <+Solideva> He shoots himself in the face with a shotgun
[3:52:38] <%ChoculaUltra> so the other tofu/desserts aren't canon?!
[3:52:39] <Graywolf_the_45th> Nah, Kendo is totally alive
[3:52:40] <+LoganPayne> Hunk is bae
[3:52:40] <+ShikiHisashi> Rita made it out
[3:52:41] <ManfredA> yes, everyone from Outbreak survived
[3:52:42] <PayneBlackNG> cHunk made it!
[3:52:42] <OwlLightningMage> He gets killed by the rose if not a zombie
[3:52:43] <gatorafan> Except Leon and Claire dating right? RIGHT!?
[3:52:43] <scrubviewer> hunk made it
[3:52:44] <+MyDarkStorm> He SHOOTS Himself not the girl
[3:52:45] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Oh hey, time for the OTHER MEME
[3:52:45] <+linSP> tofu LIVES
[3:52:45] <zedravan> outbreak is still canon
[3:52:46] <ahbhajit> rita lived, there's a cutscene
[3:52:48] <tungstenviper> Outbreak canonicity is doubtful
[3:52:49] <+SpiceMustF1ow> Tofu made it out
[3:52:49] <eddiemayfly> Inb4 Emote only chat
[3:52:49] <+Answer_Moose> Tofu makes it
[3:52:50] <natebud> The reporter made it out at least
[3:52:52] <CptBritches> Outbreak is canon
[3:52:52] <$LuisKingKing> Outbreak is indeed canon
[3:52:52] <tri3dgE027> Outbreak Guys kinda escaped also, since Alisa has a written article in RE7
[3:52:53] <WotanCR> Hunk made it
[3:52:54] <The_Introspector> Ghost Survivor are what-if scenarios and in the description says that ALL playable characters met a grim fate. He ate his gun.
[3:52:55] <Corporate_Redeemer> Rita escaped, that's how Marvin got bit.
[3:52:56] <%xenonecromera> Hunk is canon
[3:52:56] <GoldeNOVA> The four people, plus the ones from 3 and the 8 from Outbreak?
[3:52:57] <+generalve> Mod turn emote mode BACK ON
[3:52:57] <+tigerfang86> Hunk made it cause Hunk's an actual god soldier
[3:52:57] <timetraveller2000> Outbreak should be canon, for the elephant alone VoteYea VoteYea
[3:52:58] <19DarkKnight87> We didn't get a hard confirm that Kendo died. In THIS version.
[3:52:58] <KeiPrime> yeah doesnt the repotrter havea n article in re7?
[3:52:58] <definitelynotyakra> Tofu cannot be killed
[3:52:58] <+TheBimbollo> The reporter made it out
[3:53:00] <snootyhooty> The number is about less than 50 people escaped Raccoon City
[3:53:00] <+8framelag> 'Every Ada is a clone' Kappa
[3:53:01] <+ShikiHisashi> The whole tunnel under the statue is from Outbreak too
[3:53:01] <BurdRightsActivist> Ghost survivors is already out!
[3:53:02] <KeystoneA1> That one asian reporter lady from Outbreak lives since you read her account of Raccoon City in RE7
[3:53:02] <linkinbird> Pat, why do you assume there are no survivors and do assume Leon would know there isn't?
[3:53:05] <scrubviewer> Night Hawk this is hunk from alpha tram
[3:53:06] <%DashXero> "Haaay"da "Wait" Wong
[3:53:08] <+NobleJedi> City of zombies
[3:53:08] <ArtThouBored> People didn't know if Rebecca and Barry survived for instance
[3:53:10] <%Th3SmartAlec> Time for emote chat to signal to Woolie something is about to happen
[3:53:10] <FancyHatMan> PokDarkrai
[3:53:10] <+SkaNinja> leon is tired, OK
[3:53:11] <+AFrostyCookie> Yeah, Hunk, Tofu, and all the other foods
[3:53:12] <SomeDwarf> Yes, how did they d othat

[3:53:32] <WotanCR> still more subtle than a david cage game LUL
[3:53:33] <%ChoculaUltra> does Hunk appear in Tofu's ending in the remake?
[3:53:33] <+Eclipse_knight_> leon is so naive it hurts
[3:53:33] <+BorinCorran> Leon is so adorably naive.
[3:53:34] <Dragonborn983> Calling Woolie dies to the gator at least once.

[4:18:29] <+Tyler_Ruins_Games> It just happens whenever you talk. It's high-pitched, somewhat faint, but persistent.
[4:18:29] <%fatal_penguin_> Theres no Ring, Everyone Is Crazy
[4:18:30] <%mukbun> might be the ps4/elgato or whatever
[4:18:30] <bit_guardian> @woolieversus It resembles a distant helicopter.

[4:18:42] <+thebonebard> @neverforget2018 there is definently a ring but its very faint but bad enough to be super bad
[4:18:42] <Navitae> Yeah electrical humming seems a good description

[4:18:48] <happyface699> It’s earwormy
[4:18:49] <Arweynn> One of the times pat passed the camera the stream went wierd, might have hit a cable?
[4:18:49] <DrkJP520> there seemed to be distortion when pat walked infront of the camera, almost like it triggered the npoise
[4:18:50] <+NWR_James> @WoolieVersus Mute the entire stream. Silence stream is best stream

[4:33:54] <+TombstoneTTromboners> Mr. X is a good bioweapon
[4:33:57] <+Tokanova> there was supposed to be a gas that killed the zombies

[4:34:13] <DrMoose7> shits and giggles
[4:34:14] <@mothmandraws> I mean nukes make places shit for a while
[4:34:14] <Laecerelius> Look, we've used nuclear weapons, so...
[4:34:15] <PayneBlackNG> Sounds like a strong weapon doodLewd
[4:34:17] <+x24sonic> i mean it would be effective at destroying your enemy and preventing them from ever reinhabiting that area if you don't care about going there yourself
[4:34:18] <%xXichibanballer> You know nukes are probably good enough
[4:34:19] <dabirSA> the point of the t-virus isn't to turn cities into zombies, it's to make tyrants
[4:34:19] <LiquidMathew> Doesn't that whole conversation wrong? Wesker wanted to make Tyrants, zombies were side effect
[4:34:21] <+TransporterX7> Yeah but you won tho

[4:34:22] <%silencieux7> Craigslist T-virus fluid in a cup
[4:34:24] <arcaderabbit48> Guys like the Tyrants makes sense because they're designed to be super soldiers. I guess a zombie apocalypse is more like a Scorched Earth kinda thing?
[4:34:25] <Agami23> well pat, its not just that they dropped it. a dude infected a train with leaches that had the T-virus
[4:34:26] <+hkey_local_machine> That's what the antidote is for!

[4:34:37] <%Typhaeon> I'd like it if Capcom reimagined Umbrella as more like Theranos
[4:34:37] <+x24sonic> and yeah nukes are basically the same
[4:34:37] <%yoshkosh20> I just think of it as "oof that virus backfired. LETS MAKE ANOTHER ONE!!!!"
[4:34:37] <happyface699> Well to take out enemies
[4:34:38] <@mothmandraws> its not as dumb as warhammer virus bombs
[4:34:38] <lethallylactic> its all just an excuse by Spencer to develop immortallity
[4:34:39] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @tri3dgE027 Lots of cut enemies types were escaped zoo animals. There was a zombie gorilla in 2. And a bi-pedal Mountain Lion in 3, I think
[4:34:40] <Novillion> right? who thinks making a virus is a good idea?
[4:34:42] <MementoExtasis> Umbrella is owned by camern sandiego

[4:54:45] <ECRead> just like Paige did to that lady
[4:54:45] <bit_guardian> @woolieversus We thought it was clever.
[4:54:46] <+Qsmash_> Woolie is playing 4D Chess
[4:54:47] <%Th3SmartAlec> ...okay, I can see what you may havee been thinking. To be fair Ada's whole section is git gud at this mechanic in 5 minutes
[4:54:48] <+mobius_won> Paige punch
[4:54:49] <low_hell_key> WAIT CHRIS SEND HIM... it all makes sense now
[4:54:49] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:54:50] <@mothmandraws> dont worry woolie was a smart choice
[4:54:51] <%yoshkosh20> would be funny if some of the ricochets could end up hitting you
[4:54:54] <%xXichibanballer> I thought it was a good try tho
[4:54:54] <SourceHorse> you stopped the power to the switch
[4:54:55] <+JenovasPuppet> apatWrong
[4:54:56] <%PoopyDickens> it made more sense than other shit you've done @WoolieVersus
[4:54:56] <ZephynM> Now that you mention it, it's odd the door doesn't have a switch to close the it on the other side.
[4:54:57] <Gruhunchously> Mr X is Paige now?
[4:54:58] <nobknee> #BigThink
[4:54:59] <+MajiOMNI> Redfield line will prosper
[4:55:01] <KeiPrime> oh he's on caution thats why,
[4:55:02] <GeneralHysterics> Donezo
[4:55:02] <Zombrocom> @WoolieVersus it was a good try
[4:55:02] <+aivalera> What is this, fnaf?
[4:55:02] <Ultimatefool> Woolie I thought the same thing, you're not alone
[4:55:03] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> is MR.X just paige in with a hat ?
[4:55:04] <%gunplagoat> apatBig
[4:55:08] <The_Swedish_X> His logic wasn't bad, it was just missing information
[4:55:11] <+CommanderSqueaks> @ZephynM Not if it's meant to keep things in.
[4:55:11] <+Vivaciousx3> to be honest this is the weakest part of the game for me
[4:55:12] <Gray_skies1993> that sound she makes I imagine is horrendously accurate for being hit by something like that
[4:55:12] <+mobius_won> No babies for ada
[4:55:15] <+TDS462> To be fair, props to Woolie for trying to think about strategy.
[4:55:18] <%fattness132> sbfpSetIn sbfpSetIn
[4:55:18] <ArtThouBored> How would Ada know that about Annete?
[4:55:18] <chroma3> Woolie doing a LOT better than Pat did on this part tho
[4:55:19] <Gruhunchously> She's so unfazed by the whole thing.
[4:55:20] <Djinnazz> :)
[4:55:21] <ZephynM> @CommanderSqueaks Good point
[4:55:25] <CptBritches> Mr. X was sent by Chris to keep Ada from Leon
[4:55:26] <+Irridium> I mean it's not an unreasonable assumption what with many games' doors just closing themselves when the power goes
[4:55:29] <low_hell_key> no wait that IS CHRIS, HE'S WEARING A FUCKING MASK
[4:55:31] <%yoshkosh20> mr.X calls that punch the baby breaker
[4:55:32] <+Hamblasto> Man, Woolie needs to not trust his instincts
[4:55:33] <%PoopyDickens> OH LAWD HE COMIN
[4:55:35] <Sloavon> HE LOST HIM
[4:55:37] <linkinbird> Woolie is flustrated, do not provoke him.

[4:56:12] <ScreamingMeat> He could NEVER bust down that broken metal grate
[4:56:12] <+Eclipse_knight_> @woolieversus dont feel bad woolie, a lot of irl doors are set up to close when the power goes out
[4:56:14] <Joestar1890> Do not provoke the woolie!
[4:56:16] <saturnianocean> He's tired
[4:56:17] <%yoshkosh20> THIS HOLE WAS MADE FOR MEEEEE

[4:56:18] <+CommanderSqueaks> He's impressed.
[4:56:18] <TC_Lagann> Frustrated Wooolies are aggressive and known to bite
[4:56:20] <+Konquerer> couldn't be bothered
[4:56:20] <captainthunderwolf> Mr. X is afraid of jumping.

[4:56:34] <+unknowingchuck> how many deaths for the next part? place your bets

[4:56:38] <playdohface> CANT WAIT TO WATCH THIS NEXT PART
[4:56:38] <The_Swedish_X> X can only jump when he knows he'll land that down air.
[4:56:41] <captainthunderwolf> Heights are very stressful for Mr. X, Pat.

[4:56:45] <@mothmandraws> why didnt mr x just walk thorugh all the walls in the RPD

[5:05:48] <+ThatGuyfromMars> normally I'm kinda whatever but Ada seems to defy mortality because she survives like a 100ft fall in the original RE2
[5:05:48] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Your aorta is like right there
[5:05:48] <+tigerfang86> he's FINE
[5:05:49] <VritraReiRei> @WoolieVersus just rub some green herb all over that shit. patch you up in a jiff!
[5:05:51] <%LowEnergyStarman> Punished Leon
[5:05:51] <Ner234> GONE
[5:05:52] <+Gatzarlok> Depends if it's a blunt or sharp object you get impaled on. A blunt object will be more likely to move organs and what not out of the way instead of tearing into them.
[5:05:53] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @ToastyBroDude
[5:05:53] <+linSP> no he has a new model now
[5:05:53] <+king_of_beggars> A little nap and some delicious UMBRELLA BRAND UMBRELLA GREEN HHERBS
[5:05:54] <The_Swedish_X> This one makes a bit more sense than in og RE2
[5:05:55] <+Vivaciousx3> he mentions it once
[5:05:55] <WotanCR> he looks a bit like re4 leon now
[5:05:55] <ScreamingMeat> It's one of his celibate powers
[5:05:56] <+C24U> Wouldn't Mr. X have passed by Leon to get to Ada?
[5:05:56] <Corporate_Redeemer> ARYAN LEON CAN'T BE STOPPED
[5:05:57] <+LoganPayne> They literally speak of that injury again
[5:05:59] <Graxe_> Leon actually looks better like this than the full armored uniform.
[5:05:59] <Dragon_Batman> no no they mention the wound later
[5:06:01] <+SpiceMustF1ow> he's tough
[5:06:02] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Bandage > All Wounds
[5:06:04] <+Finalknightmare> MAGIC HERBS
[5:06:05] <rytisone> He's a tough boi
[5:06:06] <+Nomicro4u> He rubbed some herbs on it
[5:06:06] <+sunnythedrunk> First day on the job btw
[5:06:07] <%monkeyhous3> He's a CHAD he's fine
[5:06:08] <bestwaifuritsu> in less than 10 years he was SUPLEXING PEOPLE in fucking spain with that arm
[5:06:09] <The_Introspector> Magic herbs man.
[5:06:09] <CptBritches> He's a real man, PAt
[5:06:10] <lionmanguy> Hey

[5:06:13] <+Aullama> stripGasm Basic
[5:06:13] <SpaceGuntank> she kissed his boo boo
[5:06:14] <Jarvanii> sleep it off like kiryu
[5:06:14] <+Elky3> tatTUFF Leon toughed it out tatTUFF
[5:06:14] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus I'd say it would be worth checking out the other character costumes in the pause menu,
[5:06:14] <tungstenviper> LUL
[5:06:15] <ShichiNoBushi> Miraculous healing herbs.
[5:06:15] <+GreatBrightBlack> go find your yellow fever
[5:06:15] <%Twoiis> I know what pat is saying.
[5:06:15] <%ssjklyco> In anime, bandages heal all

[5:06:16] <+tigerfang86> SEX
[5:06:16] <+linSP> his model is now dirty and has a bandage
[5:06:16] <+8framelag> "basic" Kreygasm
[5:06:16] <%Th3SmartAlec> Some basic treatment, overtime, the usual
[5:06:17] <CastellanVon> ERB
[5:06:18] <WotanCR> RE4 LEON PogChamp
[5:06:18] <+Ellie_Eyegore> small caliber from far away and he's young
[5:06:18] <%Sunditsu> I mean it his left arm at least but yeah
[5:06:19] <BelMadness> AT LEAST its not RE7 where the dude literally glues his limbs back with fucking water
[5:06:20] <ECRead> H E A D
[5:06:22] <+Ell1ot> shove herbs into that bullet hole
[5:06:22] <+BorinCorran> That coat probably smelled like Ada. Lucky Leon.
[5:06:22] <%Methados> She rubbed some green hurbs on the bullet wound. Its fine
[5:06:24] <doomsdaydelilah> she kissed it better :)
[5:06:25] <+Reizie_Etherealm> ONE HANDED 100
[5:06:28] <+MagickBurritoh> crispy burnt
[5:06:31] <lionmanguy> Remember this is the world where herbs can cannonically STAPLE A LIMB BACK ON
[5:06:31] <@PeachSaliva> She would what Pat??
[5:06:31] <%tank7013> Leon is apparently tough as fuck though considering they imply he's just working through the pain
[5:06:32] <pirateofpie> RE protags are low key superhuman
[5:06:33] <Dragon_Batman> some alien type shit
[5:06:33] <realm_forge> She sucked the poison out
[5:06:34] <%Ion_LaserX> some basic treatment with a prescription from DAT ASS
[5:06:35] <Dragonborn983> Cutscene injury > Magic herbs
[5:06:35] <@PeachSaliva> Hmph
[5:06:37] <%Th3SmartAlec> The giant fucking thing in his chest? How bout that
[5:06:37] <tag545> its the herb juice. same stuff glued a leg back on
[5:06:38] <+aivalera> Remember that time he got his ribs slammed into a one-inch thick steel grate and the grate was the thing that broke?
[5:06:38] <JooseNeck> Herbs give Leon BIG healing... pain tolerance go UP
[5:06:41] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @WoolieVersus this is the same universe where a guy got his foot literally cut off then rubbed some herb juice on it and it was fine. You think a bullet wound is gonna stop leon?
[5:06:41] <%krispen_wa> Is he growing a Red Tree>

[5:08:45] <$prince_ire> In regards to pulling things a character got impaled with out of their body, it depends on what they got impaled with. Its its a blade or something else that has sharp edges, it actually should be taken out as leaving it in can cause further damage. If it won't cut the character by leaving it in, yeah, just leave it in.

[5:35:33] <aimlesshealer> I enjoyed the anime for what it was
[5:35:34] <%xXichibanballer> Don't watch it for the action. It's a slice of life ft. Dante from Devil May Cry
[5:35:39] <bursky00> Is not that bad, just don't expect it to be an action anime.

[5:36:38] <Them00n> You could nuke that statue
[5:36:40] <megaminimechamocha> Just imagining how trivial all of the events of RE2 would be if Dante was in Leon's shoes.

[5:39:03] <%Twoiis> oof chat explosion
[5:39:05] <konami2010> Naoto's gender issues come from how fucked up Japan is about gender roles
[5:39:05] <ShreddingPixels> Chat WutFace
[5:39:06] <$prince_ire> Kanji not gay, Naoto not Trans
[5:39:07] <+Afterman_> BIGOT CHAT BIGOT

[5:39:18] <+someguy1472> Kanji is totally straight
[5:39:19] <megaminimechamocha> Chat why are you being psychos right now?
[5:39:20] <Youwereeatenbyalid> HES NOT GAY THO
[5:39:20] <+thelastpaleemperor> PAT KANJI IS FUCKING BI
[5:39:22] <%bbHighvalor> Kanji and Naoto otp
[5:39:22] <The_Introspector> No, Troy Baker thought Kanji was gay. He wasn't told.
[5:39:22] <Sphincter_Spelunker> It's ambiguous on purpose
[5:39:22] <Sinister_Aglet> "localization"
[5:39:23] <+cvp5127> kanji is bi
[5:39:24] <KeiPrime> dude, kanji wants to give it to naoto hard tho
[5:39:25] <majindusto> KANJI IS BI
[5:39:25] <+JenovasPuppet> The English localizer staff?
[5:39:25] <roboguy2k> nooto disu shitu again
[5:39:26] <konami2010> Kanji is 15, he probably doesn't know if he's gay or straight and that's fine.
[5:39:26] <+Metballs> Shadows are not accurate
[5:39:27] <+phatmac16> By the us division
[5:39:27] <Dragonborn983> Confirmed CSB moved to weekends
[5:39:27] <ViolenceLikePoetry> Kanji is super gay.
[5:39:30] <Rhinoprotoss> THIS IS LIKE DUMBLEDORE IS GAY
[5:39:33] <+Dastardry> That staff also told them to pronounce all the Japanese words wrong in P5
[5:39:35] <Thirtine> @UrsulaCat ur fucking right PansexualPride
[5:39:35] <Corporate_Redeemer> PAT THAT'S WRONG
[5:39:35] <OwlLightningMage> This is fun LUL
[5:39:37] <Fujiwara_92> HOW CAN KANJI BE GAY IF HE LIKES NAOTO? l
[5:39:38] <+Drogavon> eh i found out I was gay when I was 11
[5:39:38] <gunblazer42> Oh god this is going the same route as the podcast.
[5:39:39] <%Dr00_PhD> Kanji is Naotosexual
[5:39:39] <The_Sighter> chat really fucking toxic right now
[5:39:40] <Divryne> RIP chat.
[5:39:41] <+SPKTR34> the entire point of kanji's arc is that he is not gay but he is insecure about the things he likes
[5:39:42] <aiyobro> kanji is not gay wtf
[5:39:43] <aimlesshealer> Everyone has to be gay and trans, get with the times you shitlords
[5:39:45] <23rald> yeah thats true
[5:39:49] <%Aussie_Manny> can't believe these scrublords are wrong about anything.
[5:39:50] <+Metballs> They're SUPER exxagertaed
[5:39:52] <JDebss> Stop projecting chat
[5:39:52] <%QueequegTheater> @Rhinoprotoss Nah, Dumby being gay is the one retcon Rowling did that actually makes sense
[5:39:52] <janitor_tulkas> Is Kanji's sexual orientation really that important?
[5:39:53] <+JenovasPuppet> Also Chie is a secret dominatrix and Yukiko is a princess.
[5:39:53] <faegbeard> The Shadow is not the true self. Yukiko is not a huge slut bird.
[5:39:55] <PinkSocks> It really doesn't fucking matter what Kanji is, that's the point. But he is bi at least, he likes Naoto.
[5:39:56] <HiddenPorpoise> The shadow is literally baiting him aimlessly
[5:39:58] <bsmusic> Guys, we gotta move on from this trash pile

[5:40:06] <aiyobro> it's about male insecurity, kanji is not gay lol
[5:40:06] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @konami2010 You'd know. It's more of his interests are considered feminine
[5:40:08] <+CommanderSqueaks> Never move on.
[5:40:08] <+cvp5127> true
[5:40:09] <+OdysseyKnight> Yu's sexual energy transcends reality
[5:40:10] <The_Swedish_X> I have a feeling a lot is getting lost between localization, and also backtracking
[5:40:11] <revzero25> Yu is best protag
[5:40:12] <WaxWitch> dick magnet LUL
[5:40:12] <The_Introspector> Yu makes Yosuke gay in the anime.
[5:40:13] <+BorinCorran> You mean the same thing that happened to Yosuke in the anime?
[5:40:14] <nobknee> This is as important as the orientation of OverWatch characters. Kappa
[5:40:15] <majindusto> ITS FUCKING YU!!!
[5:40:17] <$cureneckbeard> nyannTsun
[5:40:17] <ECRead> EVERYONE DOES THAT TO YU THOUGH
[5:40:18] <+HostilePoundcakes> NotLikeThis
[5:40:19] <megaminimechamocha> LUL @ chat whenever an LGBTQ person dares to have an opinions
[5:40:20] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Fujiwara_92 Well, you could argue that he thought Naoto was a guy at first. Kanji's clearly confused to some extent about his sexuality.
[5:40:20] <hntronium> Woolie, you and Pat are the exact kind of people that Kanji would hate
[5:40:21] <+phatmac16> That's anime harem antics
[5:40:21] <Lazyallaround> dick magnet? Sure you dont mean Sex magnet?

[5:40:23] <%Dr00_PhD> that was yosuke tho
[5:40:25] <Dragon_Batman> They still are trying to figure out what their interests are
[5:40:25] <+dougrayman> yu is a everything magnet....
[5:40:25] <ChiefSombrero> Yosuke is that stupid, cause he is
[5:40:27] <bursky00> Broske have the same reaction so his game now?
[5:40:27] <+JenovasPuppet> Kanji isn't gay, but he'd fuck Yu in a heartbeat.
[5:40:28] <th3madness> I guess yosuke is a piece of shit judging by his shadow since that's his true self Kappa
[5:40:30] <b1gboss007> kanji also blushes at the girls in bikinis

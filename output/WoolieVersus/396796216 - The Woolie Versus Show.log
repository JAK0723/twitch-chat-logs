[0:49:46] <ArbyDMC> So guys, what are your favorite Devil Breakers? Just curious.
[0:49:47] <+fatal_penguin_> I'm just a poor American who can't afford Dental. :(
[0:49:56] <+blastazoid26> Wools is using a moustroller
[0:50:11] <$SilverRoddo> “So long Dental plan.”
[0:50:15] <%UrsulaCat> crawl under the deck
[0:50:15] <drag0nbl00ded> thnx chat
[0:50:18] <+Kage_96> So how is apex going?
[0:50:18] <%yuribo26> @fatal_penguin_ no, you're an american who are a victim of awful US health practices
[0:50:23] <%UrsulaCat> lisa needs braces
[0:50:28] <+Grayhammatter> F
[0:50:29] <ArbyDMC> dental plan, Woolie needs braces
[0:50:30] <OkamiDude15> dental plan
[0:50:38] <+blastazoid26> US should fix their healthcare
[0:50:41] <DisGuyOvahEre> maybe its too late to say that you guys shouldnt be going into open spaces
[0:50:44] <+IntegratedPaper> I can't believe Woolie is dead...
[0:50:48] <%UrsulaCat> US should do a lot of things
[0:50:53] <%FistOfMonkey> HSWP TPFufun
[0:50:58] <%yuribo26> @blastazoid26 nah, gotta charge people 20k for taking a cold pill
[0:51:13] <ArbyDMC> US should perish in the coming winter
[0:51:20] <+fatal_penguin_> Yes, we need better healthcare. We got dentists who can afford going to Africa shooting endangered animals. lol
[0:51:23] <+Rum_ham1> woolie playing gibby atpRtsd

[0:51:45] <$SilverRoddo> I think we need some kawaii Braces Woolie art.
[0:51:49] <$JohnnyMedia> cheer100 Something I've been meaning to ask, You know how you and Pat have a "mentor student" dynamic in some games? Is there any game where the roles could be reversed? Could make for an interesting watch!

[0:52:56] <%UrsulaCat> TAKE-A-BREAK
[0:53:15] <Tomikozi> We definitely don't love it because of its polish, to put it nicely.
[0:53:16] <SpOOkyGhOst224> when did Tetris become this?
[0:53:19] <Darthwaffler> The weirdest part about woolies apex setup is he's the third person I've seen use this kind of fps setup.
[0:53:34] <$JohnnyMedia> Does woolie read 100bit donations? i know some people don't, just wanna know
[0:53:35] <%HDmexiqtioner> Stay Hydrated
[0:53:36] <DatAsuna> I started doing it for GTA
[0:53:43] <DatAsuna> because fuck driving with a keyboard
[0:54:03] <Tomikozi> Third Person games are exempt from the general rule that Keyboard + Mouse is best for shooters.
[0:54:08] <Tomikozi> Change My Mind.
[0:54:11] <+blastazoid26> Amnd Tetris :)
[0:54:13] <+fatal_penguin_> Is using a controller for PC that bad? Granted, I don't play multiplayer on pc, just single player games
[0:54:17] <$Lord__Ainz> cheer100 cheer100 cheer100 cheer100 cheer100 cheer100 You're seriously one of the best creators out there, Love ya Woolz.
[0:54:42] <%aishman> Woo I just won my third Tetris 99!!

[0:55:02] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @TC_Lagann but is he though? He didn't invent Stuff Crust Pizza
[0:55:03] <OkamiDude15> congrats on the win
[0:55:03] <royaljojoking> I don't think it carries over to full game. :)
[0:55:07] <%DoJoTron> Im really glad to see what this game is. Glad i missed this bullet
[0:55:09] <%aishman> And according to the stats, I KOed #5-2
[0:55:20] <$SilverRoddo> HSWP FrankerZ aishman
[0:55:46] <Lord__Ainz> @Breakfast_Megapowers we all make mistake, stuck by him after slamming breakfast, so i can let the pizza slide too (i think)
[0:55:50] <%aishman> Don't like this game @DoJoTron ?
[0:56:05] <+krispen_wa> Whew this FOV
[0:56:07] <+fatal_penguin_> I think Woolie would do well with the Spitfire. Spray and pray
[0:56:22] <+patriotrenegade> @WoolieVersus are ya winning, son?
[0:56:23] <%HDmexiqtioner> Just for clarification. they unconfirmed that Titanfall 3 is cancelled correct?
[0:56:36] <Tomikozi> Yeah, TF|3 is still possible.
[0:56:37] <@Solidus_113> fish eye lens is gross

[0:57:01] <%UrsulaCat> seymour
[0:57:09] <+fatal_penguin_> I dont mind the default 70 that the console is set to

[0:58:02] <$JohnnyMedia> you can already tell he's getting better an manuvering with the controller, good shit

[1:10:20] <El_Desperad0> Fans are the fucking worst cause they always want to spoil stuff out of excitement
[1:10:22] <TwinBat> Imagine if Pat had as much self control as Woolie
[1:10:24] <+IntegratedPaper> If it's your most anticipated game ever, why not just play it all the way in
[1:10:25] <+fantom_flasch> Yoooo
[1:10:25] <$JohnnyMedia> @woolieversus Credit where it's due though, you've improved exponentially at Apex from the first stream
[1:10:27] <metrying> @WoolieVersus Snailkiro stream with Pat?
[1:10:33] <%UrsulaCat> show naked feet
[1:10:35] <Lord__Ainz> i loved the mega dump of DMCV videos, its like when a new netflix series comes out
[1:10:37] <bobbydrill> yeah if i was in that position i wouldve thrown away every other LP til i finished it lol
[1:10:41] <+IntegratedPaper> I am sure the audience more than understands
[1:10:42] <DeathByPoke7> and now the sekiro spoiler timer is running down too
[1:10:46] <+krispen_wa> Why do you refuse to gain Spoilers? The Spoilers of our father Spoilda?
[1:10:50] <SaltyDongs> All Dmcv things involving woolie from here on out will be limited to Devil trigger only
[1:10:50] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:10:59] <$theluckyhero> isn't that the quote for beating the time horse?
[1:10:59] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Honesty I assumed the LP was futher along just not uploaded yet
[1:11:05] <HanPaul> look at this esports team LUL
[1:11:05] <%MForan98> I could see Woolie forgetting about that one because the audio was kinda all over the place
[1:11:09] <+krispen_wa> The Time Stead?
[1:11:18] <%HDmexiqtioner> Can you wall run in this? or is that a character thing?
[1:11:21] <+fatal_penguin_> The spoilers I hate are the ones on Instragram, embedded in a meme. Fuck those guys
[1:11:25] <Lord__Ainz> i imagine pat being sick slowed the pace down a bit
[1:11:26] <+khalcipher> thenk god for moderators <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
[1:11:28] <TheHeroAppears> woolie uploaded all the footaage he had that one day
[1:11:37] <@Menitta> Shit did Woolie get spoiled
[1:11:45] <+krispen_wa> Whose footsteps are those?
[1:11:46] <@Solidus_113> no
[1:11:48] <bobbydrill> no not really, just a minor V line
[1:11:49] <ArbyDMC> Spoiled on a thing he already saw.

[1:11:54] <%HDmexiqtioner> I II
[1:11:54] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Spoilers on YouTube are disgusting
[1:11:59] <%HDmexiqtioner> II I_
[1:12:04] <%shockzndrawe> The worst spoilers are the ones posted by guys on youtube who got the game early
[1:12:09] <ArbyDMC> YouTube thumbnails are the worst.
[1:12:13] <+khalcipher> yeah
[1:12:25] <Lord__Ainz> thumbnails an game defining spoiler as the title
[1:12:29] <+fatal_penguin_> Chaustic and his fart gas
[1:12:29] <bobbydrill> i had the final boss in my youtube recommended 2 days before the game came out
[1:12:32] <ArbyDMC> i indulged myself in big spoils cause I'm desperate but those guys are scummy.
[1:12:35] <Lord__Ainz> eff those people
[1:12:41] <+krispen_wa> Boss Fight Database being the greatest bro and spoiling literally every boss fight in the title and thumbnail
[1:12:43] <%Toynota10> and they put the fucking name of spoiler boss I. the video title too...
[1:12:47] <+khalcipher> youtube would have spoiled the final fight if i did not beat the game in 1 day
[1:12:48] <%shockzndrawe> @bobbydrill same
[1:13:15] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Top 10 Holy SH!t moments in DMCV- Buzzfeed
[1:13:16] <+fatal_penguin_> I was on part 11 of woolz dmc5 video and a recommended video was a SUPER spoiler. like FUCK
[1:13:16] <Lord__Ainz> i wish there was a mute keyword from appearing feature
[1:13:22] <tubbybaker> Dude you suck
[1:13:25] <%Toynota10> Yeah glad I played DMC5 early. tho, watching that trailer did also spoil lol
[1:13:29] <NumberTooBig> @khalcipher in all honesty, would a Deboot have a suprise for the final battle
[1:13:32] <+krispen_wa> krispen_wa subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:13:44] <+fantom_flasch> Yep, the recommended videos for Woolie Vs. DMC5 had thumbnail spoilers
[1:13:56] <+fantom_flasch> Youtube is the worse
[1:13:58] <+fantom_flasch> worst
[1:14:00] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @TC_Lagann But there is though, Woolie mentioned his spoiler filter tech on the Beastcast
[1:14:01] <%Toynota10> has he been spoiled?
[1:14:02] <ArbyDMC> anyone else think the announcer in this game sounds like the computer voice from ReBoot.
[1:14:05] <+blastazoid26> That last trailer had Huge spoils

[1:14:35] <+khalcipher> yeah that i got a a little bit spoiled by the last trailer
[1:14:35] <metrying> @WoolieVersus weird question but is there a chance of a days gone LP?
[1:14:39] <petpurplepanda> Tech
[1:14:40] <ArbyDMC> "Warning: ring closing" sounds really close to "warning: incoming game"
[1:14:42] <Lord__Ainz> @Breakfast_Megapowers wait forreal?
[1:14:46] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Technically Woolie and Pat SUPER spoiled Devil May Cry 5 for me
[1:14:52] <Rosy_Joan> Youtube spoiled DMC5 for me within the day of release so put that filter on high
[1:14:53] <+blastazoid26> Girls are watching
[1:14:54] <NumberTooBig> @blastazoid26 " this person that's totally in the game is in the game"
[1:14:58] <%FistOfMonkey> TODD COWARD
[1:14:59] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Well I think Billy uploaded a bunch, not Woolie but Its next to impossible to completely avoid
[1:15:19] <ArbyDMC> big sneak
[1:15:21] <%Toynota10> woolieS woolieT
[1:15:23] <%krispen_wa> I spoiled myself because it lets me reject my humanity
[1:15:23] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @TC_Lagann Yeah i think it was an engine filter where you could put keywords in and it would block anytjhing with that in it
[1:15:26] <%Toynota10> woolieF woolieU
[1:15:27] <+fantom_flasch> I'm going into DMC5 accepting all spoilers, I don't really care. I've never really cared much about them
[1:16:11] <%Toynota10> it's just that DMC5 is the most story driven/well acted entry in the series. it's special
[1:16:19] <ArbyDMC> DMC 5 did actually bring me to tears when I thought about it.
[1:16:23] <Lord__Ainz> @Breakfast_Megapowers when i get home that is absolutely the first thing im doing. we may not be in the darkest timeline afterall :')
[1:16:31] <%krispen_wa> Ehh, I liked DMC3's story a bit more
[1:16:40] <ArbyDMC> Understandable
[1:16:41] <desmondjin96> PORCO DIO
[1:16:49] <ArbyDMC> they're both very emotional
[1:16:54] <+fatal_penguin_> I guess it just reminds me of the old SBFP days. I like to be surpised as the boys are when I see the episode. Not when Youtube pre-spoils me cause of bullshit ads
[1:16:57] <$theluckyhero> tic
[1:17:02] <%HDmexiqtioner> I should have been the one to fill your dark soul with LIIIIIGHT!
[1:17:05] <ArbyDMC> but the things 5 puts into context and adds detail to makes me sad.
[1:17:07] <%FistOfMonkey> @krispen_wa i think im with you on that
[1:17:08] <NumberTooBig> DMC3 is a full self contained story, DMC is both the beginning and end of an arc
[1:17:10] <bobbydrill> the hype levels in dmc5 are higher than any game ever tho
[1:17:24] <desmondjin96> PORCO D.IO
[1:17:27] <+khalcipher> Im fucking loving DMC 5 and its my first one ty Pat and Woolie for getting me in to the games
[1:17:33] <desmondjin96> PORCO DIO
[1:17:51] <NumberTooBig> both stories work as well, i'd like the Dpad get more build up in 5 though
[1:17:51] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:17:54] <KazMkII> @WoolieVersus thoughts on the new Part 5 opening?
[1:18:02] <ArbyDMC> you know
[1:18:05] <$theluckyhero> you can live outside the ring for a while
[1:18:15] <ArbyDMC> I still think I prefer playing 4 Dante
[1:18:22] <ArbyDMC> Dante specifically
[1:18:26] <+fantom_flasch> I was pretty tepid on the Vento Aureo OP
[1:18:30] <%Toynota10> @evilkaz he said earlier he liked it and he loves the new ending more
[1:18:39] <+fantom_flasch> But I know the finale of the part is super hype
[1:18:46] <TigerClaws12> mid game white armor monkaS
[1:18:56] <+Trimoon333> not enjoying the fov
[1:19:00] <Lord__Ainz> havent watched the newest episode yet, but Fighting gold has been my jam since it started airing
[1:19:02] <%DedlokPM> Yeah. I do not like the new opening or closing song, but love the visuals of both
[1:19:02] <%HDmexiqtioner> Can't wait for someone to pick up that phone
[1:19:04] <KazMkII> I see. I thought it was ok. The music was better than the visuals tbh
[1:19:19] <%krispen_wa> The lack of feeling horny makes any ending inherently worse
[1:19:24] <Lord__Ainz> and freakin you as the outro? thats gonna be hard to top
[1:19:25] <+khalcipher> lets change subject so the chat does not spoil stuff to Woolie
[1:19:26] <%krispen_wa> unless its gangsta's paradise
[1:19:31] <KazMkII> watching part 5 really reminds me why I dont rate it that highly in the series
[1:19:40] <+Dovakhin573> I like the new opening it reminds me of a classic rock song
[1:20:08] <%krispen_wa> The gang beating the shit out of a random passerby is why I rate it highly
[1:20:14] <+LilNatFour> that was crazy
[1:20:33] <+Dovakhin573> Jeses the way that smg fully upgraded sounds
[1:20:38] <+Dovakhin573> jesus

[1:20:55] <Darthwaffler> You have to shoot them Woolie. You have to SHOOT them Woolie! sbfpPatschwitz
[1:20:58] <TigerClaws12> r-99 is scary af if you can handle the recoil
[1:21:13] <%FistOfMonkey> @dovakhin573 But what about jeses tho
[1:21:15] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I wonder if the owners of Gangsters Paradise just said "No" when DP asked to license it

[1:26:30] <%HDmexiqtioner> When's TF2 PS4?
[1:26:30] <Triplicat> flatline
[1:26:32] <Triplicat> topical
[1:26:43] <Triplicat> what do you guys think of counterstrike tagging being in this game
[1:26:50] <NumberTooBig> when's Orange Box stream
[1:26:53] <+HyperCharge_Sam> every time I see TF2, all I think about is Team Fortress 2
[1:26:55] <$JohnnyMedia> i feel like a total idiot, I guess i just didnt realize Woolie was actively trying to teach cuz i watched all their LP's
[1:27:07] <Lord__Ainz> @FistOfMonkey i would give anything to watch pat try the trials in mirrors edge while Woolie cackle menacingly
[1:27:16] <$JohnnyMedia> The Titanfall 2 LP was the reason i bought it in the first place ffs
[1:27:20] <extradopeness> Yo
[1:27:38] <%IMDRanged> Great I can see Woolie's player sleeve colors
[1:27:41] <KazMkII> why keep the p2020 over the scout?
[1:27:45] <brianthe12th> Same Johnny
[1:28:01] <haitakaa> apparently cheating is a big issue in Apex
[1:28:07] <+Scrivener_exe> I hope that they fix the hitboxes soon
[1:28:12] <+Dovakhin573> You know Ihe scout is kinda good
[1:28:19] <+fatal_penguin_> g7 Scout is the worst
[1:28:24] <NumberTooBig> @haitakaa cheating in a popular online shotter, NOOOooo, really???
[1:28:25] <$JohnnyMedia> in fact I'm gonna rewatch those LP's to make up for the sin
[1:28:28] <%cervidaequus> woolieSMUG woolieSMUG woolieSMUG
[1:28:32] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> When are they gonna mod Pokemon Red into this game?
[1:28:36] <scrumbotime> I just came from finally watching the Titanfall 2 lp on the old channel coincidentally
[1:28:36] <brianthe12th> beat the story a few weeks ago and got up to nearly level 40 in multiplayer, it's a good time
[1:28:39] <bobbydrill> cant believe he ditched the triple take for 2 flatlines
[1:28:43] <petpurplepanda> I love the G7
[1:28:56] <+Scrivener_exe> I really like the G7 too, with a scope
[1:28:59] <+fatal_penguin_> Mirror's Edge one is my fav. Hearing them fangasm over a game I played when it came out too is amazing. Plus, that elevator story
[1:29:03] <haitakaa> @NumberTooBig for some reason it's more of an issue in Apex than other bgs, maybe because fortnite striaght up sues people
[1:29:04] <extradopeness> G7 is great
[1:29:05] <%DedlokPM> When are they going to mod hats into this game?
[1:29:12] <Sir_Dolphinian> my god i was sitting here wondering why the hud keeps flipping between controller and keyboard icons until i remembered who were dealing with here.

[1:30:43] <haitakaa> wait so he's aiming with controller but moving with keyboard?
[1:30:47] <catwithsunglasses> Looks like it's time to adapt or perish, Woolz
[1:31:01] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @haitakaa Other way around
[1:31:04] <%DedlokPM> @haitakaa moving with controller, aiming with mouse
[1:31:09] <+KamikazeKeeg> Are we hearing audio from his TV or this actual capture?
[1:31:11] <wsintai> @haitakaa Dont think too hard about it. The human mind cannot comprehend his ways
[1:31:14] <Lord__Ainz> Hitbox Shaming in 2019
[1:31:20] <DeathByPoke7> woolie is the tank
[1:31:21] <brianthe12th> i think i saw around 4000 players on ps4 multiplayer recently
[1:31:26] <extradopeness> I don't get it either but it seems to work
[1:31:34] <+ofloofy> woolie would be the tank
[1:31:42] <brianthe12th> thats the peak though, usually around 2-3000
[1:31:56] <Sir_Dolphinian> @TC_Lagann but woolie plays with an even more confusing set up than a hitbox :o
[1:32:07] <%Skullgod> internet went out :(
[1:32:07] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:32:16] <haitakaa> he's actually using his feet to move with a DDR pad
[1:32:22] <Lord__Ainz> @Sir_Dolphinian i meant his teammate was shaming his characters Hitbox LUL
[1:32:24] <$JohnnyMedia> Hey Chat, he's using mouse for aim and Joystick for movement right?
[1:32:27] <haitakaa> and aiming with a rock band drum set
[1:32:31] <Rosy_Joan> joysticks are actually super efficient and precise for movement
[1:32:34] <wsintai> I only play Apex Legends with an original Street Fighter 1 arcade cabinet

[1:44:18] <+fatal_penguin_> Oh jeez
[1:44:20] <SirDogBear> woolie would rather be called a pie stealer than someone who relies on boss characters

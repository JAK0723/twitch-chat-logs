[0:23:59] <%UrsulaCat> god I hate this headspace I'm getting into
[0:24:01] <Spaffs> here's the sad thing boys: how big and pro a game's competitive scene look is now entirely determined by getting a few multi million dollar advertisers, or having the publisher astroturf it with esports money
[0:24:08] <+ledgefiend> how many people here actually play melee/
[0:24:10] <@Menitta> Lmao
[0:24:13] <%TheMilhouseExperience> But does that really justify quitting the entire tournament?
[0:24:14] <@mothmandraws> like in 10 years time, what will they do if you need that % of controlers and everyone keeps salty throwing them at walls
[0:24:18] <+ledgefiend> Im down to play melee with the woolieversus community
[0:24:22] <%UrsulaCat> chat is making me into a horny shithead
[0:24:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> lol
[0:24:27] <atin2000> This is why i want melee to leave. it involves "tech" thats just a bunch of exploits, and you need a factory defect controller to get ahead.
[0:24:28] <%theAncopro> We playin gacha
[0:24:38] <Nebiroth_> where's synnett the god when we need him to explain controllers OSKomodo
[0:24:42] <%GingaNZ> @UrsulaCat yeah thats the chats fault
[0:24:44] <Spaffs> honestly most of the community members from melee i talked to said "99% of players dont give a shit about having that specific defect"
[0:24:44] <sunnythedrunk> Kage is not the person to explain this LUL
[0:24:45] <Nebiroth_> KomodoHype
[0:24:48] <Spaffs> then they insulted the one guy who cared
[0:24:48] <+thunderhog> true but it sounds very minute of a detail. its like saying "i cant play on my fightstick unless my 4 gate is chipped slightly to become a 5 gate controller

[0:25:28] <Sir_Walrus> UCF exists so it doesn't matter anymore lmfao
[0:25:30] <%TheMilhouseExperience> But does that justify quitting the entire tournament? I think not.
[0:25:31] <%GohanEgret> @MyNameIsDango pat got that surgery to add a foot to his height
[0:25:34] <%UrsulaCat> @MyNameIsDango which one is which
[0:25:36] <+AccioSkullar> im glad at least some of the misinformation will stop lmao
[0:25:38] <@Menitta> I get that feeling
[0:25:42] <sunnythedrunk> It makes one mechanic easier so the pro's mod their controller, but you don't need it
[0:25:43] <+DylanDec> Adapt
[0:25:44] <ManOfReason> The reason why it matters more for melee than traditional fighters is because it is analog control
[0:25:46] <Press_Any> this is really not a solid argument
[0:25:53] <+chaos5338> just play on joy cons Kappa
[0:25:56] <@Menitta> Preferrably I would rather use my controller
[0:26:05] <%The_Timo> That situation sounds like someone being a whiny dick about their controller lol
[0:26:08] <+SaltyPrime> I play on joy cons!
[0:26:10] <@mothmandraws> do they check controllers for hax or some stuff
[0:26:15] <Nina96> iam assuming wooile is green samus?
[0:26:19] <+thackattack00> god i hate fox
[0:26:20] <labanderox> this reminds me of the time woolie stopped using octo gates because when his broke, borrowing another one felt like hell
[0:26:22] <%theAncopro> Are we saying controller johns are justified
[0:26:23] <@mothmandraws> alot of fps have to use in house stuff
[0:26:24] <ShaykhSpear> kage stop tryna interupt
[0:26:26] <+wal__rus> @mothmandraws they check boxes
[0:26:28] <@mothmandraws> to prevent shit loaded on mice
[0:26:32] <ShaykhSpear> let reggie speak holy
[0:26:32] <+MisterAngryEyes112> @mothmandraws what hax? Melee is completely analogue
[0:26:38] <ActingKing42> @WoolieVersus least favorite character?

[0:26:59] <VorpalSlash> Oh we're just getting started
[0:27:00] <+TxukasaVersus> pls the ppl who are saying its being whiney pls stop.. like i understand that you dont get iy but its a legitimate jon...if you dont play the game you wont get it
[0:27:00] <CerberusDriver> are they defending armada, i just came back
[0:27:01] <+DylanDec> Jesus
[0:27:01] <WarchiefGoldva> What the actual hell, man. That's actual cheating.
[0:27:06] <%UrsulaCat> if you were a smarter player you'd cheat
[0:27:07] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Modded?! This sounds sketchy.
[0:27:08] <gnarly_memes_bro> wtf thats legal?
[0:27:10] <+President_Miyazaki> "Can you blame him?" Yes. Yes i can.
[0:27:10] <+SaltyPrime> That’s fucked
[0:27:10] <+chaos5338> how is that legal?
[0:27:12] <+DylanDec> This makes it worse
[0:27:13] <+PtetDorf> its allowed because the value is like a single degree
[0:27:14] <bearwagon> thats just how it is isnt really a good argument?
[0:27:14] <mayorrev> feels like cheating still
[0:27:15] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> atpRtsd1
[0:27:16] <Spaffs> like pat angrily said on the podcast: "if you're mad that you don't have the individual broken feature nobody else gets, then you are a cheater. not like a cheater, you're cheating."

[0:27:24] <ShaykhSpear> CHEATING
[0:27:25] <VorpalSlash> I hope they talk about arduinos
[0:27:26] <JetpackMcQuack> Yeah I can blame them
[0:27:29] <Aya_namiko> how is it cheating when its just adding more to the gate already on the controller?
[0:27:29] <Psyramics> who defines these rules? this sounds like a bunch of rich fucks sitting around deciding fiscal policy
[0:27:30] <CaliforniaPotatoPowers> such great lengths just to make a game competitive
[0:27:32] <+psydaku> but hitbox is banned ?
[0:27:32] <%lewdskeletor13> It’s literally cheating tho
[0:27:37] <pazuuuzuuuu> or try to win of course
[0:27:37] <Core_Value> That aint falco

[0:27:48] <%afronooch> WOMBO COMBO
[0:27:49] <%TheMilhouseExperience> I quit cause my controller isn’t cheating for me.
[0:27:50] <YeezusPieces1> I stopped trying to understand smash players long ago.
[0:27:56] <Aya_namiko> its like getting a 8way gate instead of a 4way
[0:27:56] <Sir_Walrus> Finally they're talking about UCF

[0:28:02] <%CEGold> @afronooch That aint Falco
[0:28:04] <+dragoniota> guys this is only a real issue fairly recently. most of the games lifespan didnt take this issue into consideration
[0:28:04] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> ucf wasn't on I hear? Should be replayed imo???
[0:28:09] <+wal__rus> UCF is literally the solution
[0:28:10] <+primax104> the line between legal and illegal here seems extremely arbitrary
[0:28:15] <CerberusDriver> I dont understand why Melee is so special, that they get special rules when this wouldnt fly in any other fighting game
[0:28:19] <+wal__rus> this was before UCF was widespread
[0:28:20] <edward11231> I’m going to school at UCF :)
[0:28:20] <YeezusPieces1> They're just a different breed from regualr fg players man
[0:28:22] <%afronooch> @CEGold HAPPY FEET
[0:28:31] <RadShiro> CLICK CLICK CLACK CLACK CLICK
[0:28:31] <+DylanDec> What is cheating in melee then?
[0:28:33] <labanderox> geez smash rules are SO refined
[0:28:36] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Soory I ml
[0:28:37] <+Personified134> @CerberusDriver because they ran their own tournaments for decades so they set their own rules
[0:28:37] <sunnythedrunk> ITS TRUE
[0:28:37] <Sir_Walrus> (but it doesn't)
[0:28:40] <+chaos5338> UCF is a nice school.
[0:28:41] <labanderox> down to the nitty details
[0:28:42] <juxtest> juxtest subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:28:43] <%CEGold> @afronooch OOOOH!!!
[0:28:54] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Sorry I'm late bois. YEEYEYEYEYEYEYEEY lets Smash!
[0:28:55] <@mothmandraws> ye but then its on level playing field then?
[0:28:55] <manstertruck> That shit wasn't true though
[0:28:57] <+wal__rus> disrespect mangoPog
[0:29:01] <+mushymoto> makes moonwalking ez
[0:29:01] <Core_Value> Mew2 4Head
[0:29:04] <+relentingapunch> >No end match screen
[0:29:05] <+Friendlyjuice96> it is a perfect solution because thats not true at all
[0:29:06] <+relentingapunch> DansGame
[0:29:07] <%GingaNZ> cheating for real
[0:29:07] <+PtetDorf> LITERALLY A MYTH
[0:29:08] <ManOfReason> @CerberusDriver melee is very insular in that they created all their rules from the ground up without refering to other fighting games
[0:29:10] <+TxukasaVersus> makes it equal
[0:29:13] <HanPaul> StinkyCheese StinkyCheese StinkyCheese StinkyCheese StinkyCheese StinkyCheese
[0:29:16] <+primax104> Nintendo had no clue
[0:29:16] <%CaptainPileDriver> i mean
[0:29:16] <Lukas_Ipsum> oh God, that roster feels so... small
[0:29:18] <+wal__rus> UCF ITS TRUE
[0:29:19] <%UrsulaCat> IF YOU WERE SMARTER you'd cheat
[0:29:20] <+BraveThanatos22> Just got here. What's a fix for what?
[0:29:21] <@mothmandraws> id go for the level field
[0:29:23] <%theAncopro> because nintendo was like LOL Smash is a fighting game?
[0:29:25] <manstertruck> ucf didnt touch pivots that was flat earth tier bullshit
[0:29:27] <WarchiefGoldva> They are LITERALLY COMPLAINING ABOUT FIXING THE BROKEN-ASS GAME
[0:29:29] <+IAmSkeleton> woolie is asking really fair questions that have fair answers but these guys are not good at explaining them
[0:29:29] <+Personified134> @BraveThanatos22 the broken controller meme
[0:29:29] <Spaffs> LETS make the entire scene ridiculous and not use a fix that fixes it because it inconveniences the top 1% of players. this is how you make a healthy community with more players
[0:29:30] <%TheMilhouseExperience> So your playing sfv vanilla?
[0:29:31] <@mothmandraws> sounds more sustainable
[0:29:35] <+JimboDorf> @PtetDorf have they played yet
[0:29:37] <+miyamotomusashi_> almost every local runs UCF, arduino adapters will cover the majors. vanilla is dead
[0:29:40] <+primax104> I'm not sure they could have predicted this.
[0:29:40] <labanderox> i wish pat was here
[0:29:45] <+PtetDorf> @manstertruck truer words have never been spoke
[0:29:48] <Rosy_Joan> so only crybabies are allowed to use controllers that can tech in ways the standardized controllers cant.
[0:29:52] <Sir_Walrus> @WoolieVersus the main problem is that Nintendo wouldn't sponsor tournaments that use this fix because they're huge babies
[0:29:52] <kerwinftw> UCF is so good
[0:29:53] <Core_Value> What if they were just over thinking it the entire time and the actual based way is to play with items
[0:29:54] <+PtetDorf> no jimbo
[0:29:55] <Aya_namiko> The solution is to play projectM :^)
[0:29:57] <+mrcooperblack> More will find their way to us now now that the olive branch is here.
[0:29:57] <VorpalSlash> Shoulda funded the Smash Stick
[0:29:57] <HanPaul> If Pat was there, he'd just be pissing on the gamecube
[0:29:59] <atin2000> its not like the top 1% of smash players have ever cared about anyone else
[0:29:59] <+Dr_DangerPhD> how is shielding while ledge dropping legal tech????
[0:30:02] <+FloorBurger> Play on a Steel Battalion controller.
[0:30:02] <@mothmandraws> tbf pat would ruin the discussion by just shouting
[0:30:08] <+MellowYellowFellow> holy hell i thought woolie was big who is this goliath?
[0:30:08] <SuperKirby24> I can hear pat seething somewhere
[0:30:08] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:30:09] <RadShiro> Sounds to me like the top players should just the fuck up and just get good with regular controllers
[0:30:11] <kerwinftw> @atin2000 huh?
[0:30:11] <CaliforniaPotatoPowers> this is one reason why it's gone from evo. running Melee is a logistical nightmare
[0:30:11] <CastellanVon> If Pat were here, there would be no discussion. Just everyone else dying on stream as Pat just shits his pants screaming
[0:30:12] <%SpiritOki> lmao
[0:30:13] <ConeCorvid> the solution is to play rivals of aether
[0:30:13] <+z2_midori> I haven't been to a local in like 18 months that doesn't use UCF thank god
[0:30:15] <+primax104> @labanderox the chat is here to substitute for Pat. We must become the PAT
[0:30:22] <+BraveThanatos22> What is the broken controller meme?
[0:30:27] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Pat is justified. Pat is still right.
[0:30:28] <+Personified134> pat would ruin the discussion by not listening and just saying the same thing over and over more loudly
[0:30:28] <sunnythedrunk> Rivals of Aether Kreygasm
[0:30:30] <kerwinftw> @radshiro Unfortunately that's not the case
[0:30:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> @mothmandraws pat would also just be constantly throwing insults honestly
[0:30:33] <%Crashfan01> We were the Pat all along
[0:30:33] <r_Foeburden87> Yo did they talk about the collision fiasco at all ?
[0:30:35] <Core_Value> 3 more
[0:30:36] <Amaterasu98> Melee is still a good game
[0:30:38] <lukeyp95> broken controller meme is from kotaku
[0:30:43] <ShaykhSpear> melee players confirmed cheaters
[0:30:43] <+ItsAGundamu> !uptime
[0:30:43] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 30 minutes and 45 seconds
[0:30:43] <%The_Timo> Really just sounds like people are too sensitive about needing it to be the exact way they want, instead of growing the fuck up and accepting shit lol
[0:30:44] <+dragoniota> gamecube controller issues apply to all smash games btw. the controllers are very inconsistent
[0:30:45] <DatAsuna> Pat wouldn't be getting in their faces in person like that that
[0:30:45] <+chaos5338> ask them about Project M?
[0:30:46] <YeezusPieces1> Ultimate > Melee come @ me
[0:30:47] <@mothmandraws> id rather hear their logic
[0:30:50] <%GohanEgret> stubborn Kappa
[0:30:51] <+DylanDec> you either die as Liam or see yourself become Pat
[0:30:53] <%UrsulaCat> regressive
[0:30:54] <+HyperCharge_Sam> "that sounds reasonable" apatWhat
[0:30:56] <+relentingapunch> @YeezusPieces1
[0:31:03] <Core_Value> Clap
[0:31:04] <+ThePayphone> I dont play or enjoy or watch melee but the hate is such a circlejerk
[0:31:05] <DatAsuna> Pat just does the screaming shit for the podcast when it's just him and woolz
[0:31:07] <%laserbeaming> apatLiz I feel shorter and redder apatLiz
[0:31:08] <@mothmandraws> even if I think this path will fuck melee in like 5-10 years vs making it a level field and going with that
[0:31:14] <Plague_Nurse> @DylanDec implying Liam was a good person
[0:31:14] <%UrsulaCat> Liam is good and pure and boy
[0:31:14] <VorpalSlash> Yes it was, it's called Project M
[0:31:16] <HanPaul> what about that Project M or whatvber
[0:31:16] <+Personified134> @BraveThanatos22 Some players have super specific anal preferences for their controllers to the point that once or twice people have dropped out of a tournament instead of taking a replacement controller from someone else
[0:31:17] <Lukas_Ipsum> who is the 4th?
[0:31:17] <@mothmandraws> even if some lose some tech
[0:31:19] <CastellanVon> Only Ultimate is a true sequel in all of Smash. 64, Melee, Brawl, and Smash 4 are all pretty different at competitive level.
[0:31:21] <@Solidus_113> "this is different I don't like it" woolieMIRIN woolieMIRIN woolieMIRIN
[0:31:23] <CerberusDriver> what input delay
[0:31:24] <CaliforniaPotatoPowers> they're not completely broken
[0:31:26] <Core_Value> After?
[0:31:27] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus how do they feel about melee and smash 4 boh being at previous evos?
[0:31:31] <+mrcooperblack> whu happun
[0:31:32] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Drink more caffeine. Drugs help
[0:31:34] <ShaykhSpear> there balanced
[0:31:34] <+chaos5338> project M was cool.
[0:31:35] <+tygermom> wait
[0:31:36] <+MisterAngryEyes112> @mothmandraws get rid of the tech and you lose the essence of melee dood
[0:31:37] <+tygermom> is that kage?
[0:31:39] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Combat_Fries
[0:31:45] <kenzaki_> @chaos5338 Project M also had a lot of weird changes to characters
[0:31:46] <edward11231> Didn’t hbox go to Ucf?
[0:31:46] <%lewdskeletor13> “If it’s not exactly the way I want it it’s bad” sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo
[0:31:46] <+BraveThanatos22> @Personified134 I think I have found the articles. Yeah I see
[0:31:47] <Biggredd87> Guys the difference is the ability to combo. No momentum carried from jumps, etc
[0:31:47] <+Personified134> yeah its kage
[0:31:47] <@mothmandraws> but didnt they ban wabbling in tournies
[0:31:48] <+wal__rus> melee is faster and has more combo potential thats the beginning and end of it
[0:31:49] <+chaos5338> didn't Melee have a patched version on disk?
[0:31:51] <%laserbeaming> I like Rivals of Aether as a Melee substitute
[0:31:53] <cheezbass> why arent yall playing brawl Kappa
[0:31:56] <+BraveThanatos22> Preferences matter, but I mean I get it.
[0:31:56] <lukeyp95> ultimate has a dumb buffer that fucks Ur inputs up. (I play ultimate)
[0:31:59] <+PtetDorf> melee conserves momentum as you move
[0:31:59] <+Combat_Fries> azaxeW
[0:32:04] <kenzaki_> @laserbeaming What about Slap City
[0:32:07] <Sir_Walrus> Brawl had Tripping LUL
[0:32:09] <@Solidus_113> Imagine 3rd Strike players going to Vanilla Street Fighter 4 woolieSMUG
[0:32:09] <+wal__rus> @chaos5338 yeah but they barely fixed anything
[0:32:11] <SuperKirby24> why play melee when there's shrek superslam Kappa
[0:32:13] <+Pungulator> Did I miss Slap City
[0:32:13] <%Crashfan01> Rivals of aether is the best version of melee
[0:32:15] <Xeno351> i don't have my 1 frame kill move BabyRage
[0:32:15] <+PtetDorf> they really arent playing in a way that shows off how cool melee is
[0:32:16] <+MisterRockett> Was it harder or could you just not do the same thing you've been doing?
[0:32:17] <%TheMilhouseExperience> So sf4 to sf5 and you didn’t want to make the jump?
[0:32:17] <+PtetDorf> fucking floaties
[0:32:18] <labanderox> but doesn't ultimate let you play more different character styles?
[0:32:19] <mayorrev> "the most recent one" cmonBruh
[0:32:23] <VorpalSlash> @chaos5338 Some discs have minor bugfixes, PAL has some balance changes
[0:32:23] <%GohanEgret> @Pungulator nope
[0:32:24] <%Cavumentum> Here comes Wollie with the bad player advantage
[0:32:25] <CaliforniaPotatoPowers> @wal__rus those are byproducts of the game being broken
[0:32:27] <moogleboy1984> "I can't cheat to win"
[0:32:28] <BrownBearMR> Woolz is playing samus?
[0:32:28] <+chaos5338> @wal__rus thanks for the info.
[0:32:31] <+MisterAngryEyes112> Wobbling is banned because its overpowered as fuck and Melee can't patch it
[0:32:31] <CastellanVon> Melee has bugs that makes things more fun and less annoying characters at high level imo.
[0:32:31] <%laserbeaming> @kenzaki_ Not played it. Might try it
[0:32:32] <%s_xylocalsingles> @mothmandraws some states banned Wobbling, TOs got together and banned it, so some states it’s illegal
[0:32:33] <+DylanDec> @Solidus_113 Daigo won the first evo for sf4
[0:32:33] <fairore> @labanderox yes
[0:32:34] <+Pungulator> Nice. Slap City is sick
[0:32:40] <@mothmandraws> for me its sure you are losing a small % of tech but in return you wont run out of working controlers with the specific quirks in like 10 years
[0:32:41] <+mushymoto> Slap city > ultimate LUL
[0:32:43] <r_Foeburden87> So no talk about the collision shit over the weekend ?
[0:32:45] <HanPaul> Woolz not playing Kirby, what a non-fan
[0:32:47] <+Pungulator> Easily @mushymoto
[0:32:47] <+TxukasaVersus> is he talking about smash 4 or ult?
[0:32:51] <+MisterAngryEyes112> Granted, ICIES aren't overpowered so its a sticky situation
[0:32:51] <lukeyp95> 4
[0:32:53] <+ennui_on_me> Woolie really playin pro rn
[0:32:55] <+tygermom> kirby is garbage tier
[0:32:55] <RadShiro> Slap City > Melee
[0:32:58] <+TxukasaVersus> ahh yea 4 is trash lol
[0:32:59] <Aya_namiko> ProjectM its slightly different physics feel and due to new movement tech (that is beneficial) it can mess you up if you are still trying to play it exactly like melee
[0:33:03] <moogleboy1984> @r_Foeburden87 collision shit?
[0:33:13] <thisnameisnotcreative> slap is unironically amazing imo
[0:33:22] <fairore> @r_foeburden87 they're melee players man
[0:33:23] <+tygermom> i would say it's more than a small amount of tech
[0:33:25] <Aya_namiko> its better but melee purists will still complain
[0:33:25] <ShaykhSpear> melle talking about street fighter?? YET
[0:33:29] <+Epic_Skeptic> Epic_Skeptic subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:33:31] <+tygermom> like a huge amount
[0:33:35] <@mothmandraws> ok tyger
[0:33:37] <@mothmandraws> but whats worse
[0:33:38] <@mothmandraws> that
[0:33:47] <@mothmandraws> or no special controlers in 10 years anyway
[0:33:50] <+Pungulator> Slap City is easily top 2 platform fighter
[0:33:53] <r_Foeburden87> Collision 2019 (Last sunday) Smash p[layer just walked of the stage due to heckling, INSTEAD of being DQ he later won the tournament
[0:33:59] <+Personified134> @Aya_namiko Nintendo literally C@D'd PM so I dunno why you're talking about it
[0:34:03] <%GabeSweetMan> Would Pat spontaneously combust out of rage if he were to walk into the room right now?
[0:34:04] <+attackofthesage> Woolie playing melee? What's next, he wavedashes :O
[0:34:08] <+tygermom> i'd still rather play melee while it's still available
[0:34:09] <+Pungulator> Whether its better than Melee is the only debate
[0:34:10] <stoneham100> wait who are these people
[0:34:13] <+tygermom> i dont think about the future
[0:34:17] <%UrsulaCat> melee players
[0:34:20] <%UrsulaCat> stinky
[0:34:21] <lukeyp95> I like playing pm but only with the melee chars. they made all the brawl chars jank as fuck
[0:34:21] <CerberusDriver> >Anthem outsold RE 2 how
[0:34:22] <moogleboy1984> Melee just needs to be removed from all tournaments at this point
[0:34:22] <HanPaul> Mahvel Kreygasm
[0:34:25] <kenzaki_> @r_Foeburden87 Someone was yelling directions out to the other player
[0:34:27] <%gunslinger_xxiv> Is #1 Lethal League?
[0:34:29] <+Combat_Fries> @r_Foeburden87 if you dont really know then dont type thats not how it happened
[0:34:30] <moogleboy1984> no one still plays SF2 Vanilla
[0:34:36] <Fixiak> Oh damn, kage, Spicy, what's up
[0:34:37] <fairore> oh boy
[0:34:38] <CastellanVon> Marsss was going to get a TO midgame. It's legal in the universal ruleset but tbh, most people don't read the ruleset.
[0:34:38] <mr_miyagichu> @mothmandraws honestly most people probably don’t use special controllers and you can buy third party controllers that are custom anyway
[0:34:41] <+mushymoto> marvel 2 infinites atpChar
[0:34:42] <ShaykhSpear> GET GID
[0:34:42] <+Clundy> Clundy subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:34:44] <Sir_Walrus> @mothmandraws except UCF exists so the controller thing is a non-issue EXCEPT Nintendo won't sponsor events using UCF because they don't like anybody messing with their games
[0:34:45] <CerberusDriver> i guess normies really dont care about Anthems problems
[0:34:46] <+tygermom> eventually yes the game will die due to lack of equipment but so what?
[0:34:48] <+Noponiz> shouldnt at least the mods not be dickheads about the game being played in chat?
[0:34:49] <+tygermom> things die eventually
[0:34:50] <lukeyp95> I played a sonic one time in pm and knew the game wasnt for me lol
[0:34:51] <ShaykhSpear> melle players complain too much
[0:34:51] <Nina96> those controllers are so loud even in stream...
[0:34:52] <fairore> its about to get spicy
[0:34:54] <+attackofthesage> @lukeyp95 Snake, Sonic, Wolf, and Lucario are all sick in PM
[0:34:55] <detovini> its actually mar-vell
[0:34:57] <%UrsulaCat> I'll die eventually
[0:34:59] <VorpalSlash> Any time a melee player enters PM they lose to an unfamiliar character and lay off the whole game
[0:35:03] <PSI_Guy95> gotta love the clickedy clack
[0:35:03] <r_Foeburden87> Was yelling about his jumping tendancies correct?
[0:35:13] <HanPaul> Ironman infinite Kreygasm
[0:35:13] <+dragoniota> love brawl but it even punishes you for commiting with tripping
[0:35:14] <McHerpyDerps> melee is different so its bad and also smashers is stinky xD
[0:35:14] <lukeyp95> wolf is sick but that's it @attackofthesage
[0:35:14] <+mushymoto> funny enough wavedashing is in mahvel atpCap
[0:35:21] <+tygermom> pressing buttons is fun
[0:35:22] <kenzaki_> @r_Foeburden87 "Watch the jump" and shit like that, Marss overreacted a bit but I can see where he's coming from
[0:35:23] <sunnythedrunk> True
[0:35:24] <+Personified134> again, PM got CEASE AND DESISTED, why are we still arguing about it
[0:35:39] <sunnythedrunk> nairoPower
[0:35:41] <+Pungulator> There was no C&D
[0:35:42] <ShaykhSpear> melee players talking about boxing YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET
[0:35:45] <PSI_Guy95> "Melee players like pressing buttons" damn straight

[0:35:49] <HanPaul> doing a Smash stream without Liam DansGame
[0:35:50] <Sir_Walrus> Oh shit it's kage time
[0:35:50] <Biggredd87> @mothmandraws for me, the issue with the new smash games is that there are less ways to combo your opponents. Theres less hitstun, you move slower, momentum doesn’t carry over when jumping. Its not just tech. Theres a very big difference in the actual feel of of the gameplay
[0:35:55] <+primax104> Make it real
[0:35:56] <smig> LUL
[0:35:57] <VorpalSlash> @Personified134 It actually didn't, and the game is still alive

[0:36:01] <@Cranky_Construct> kage the warrior? sick
[0:36:02] <CastellanVon> PM got warned by C&D. The poor devs weren't ready for million dollar lawsuits
[0:36:02] <+primax104> famous last words XD
[0:36:02] <%linkwolf4> lytDORF
[0:36:03] <+chaos5338> since the switch got hacked, is there any way to get project M for ultimate?
[0:36:04] <DuckTheDuckDuck> what a record LMAO
[0:36:04] <kenzaki_> PM also had a lot of bad changes to characters like Lucas and shit like that, but that's just me OpieOP
[0:36:06] <lukeyp95> show him ganon on Yoshi's kage

[0:36:08] <%TheMilhouseExperience> SF2 full turbo is ideal speed. Why is 3rd strike so slow?!
[0:36:11] <@mothmandraws> sure big I can see why people dont want the later ones
[0:36:15] <kenzaki_> PM was far from perfect and has A LOT of problems
[0:36:20] <kenzaki_> I'd rather player Ultimate
[0:36:20] <+MisterAngryEyes112> there was no official CandD but there was a review of PM's official legal status and it didn't look good
[0:36:23] <+Personified134> @VorpalSlash the game is alive in the hands of different devs because the original devs were getting nintendo lawyers sending them letters
[0:36:23] <VorpalSlash> VideoGameLawyer scared the PM devs and they quit
[0:36:23] <kenzaki_> *play
[0:36:25] <HanPaul> Brawl had no mouthfeel 4Head
[0:36:29] <+kravdra> idk parrys

[0:36:37] <+Combat_Fries> @kenzaki_ player was coaching as defined by the rule set in use - the TO used his disgression and told them to replay match
[0:36:38] <+tygermom> the later ones just dont scratch the same itch
[0:36:40] <+tygermom> that's all it is
[0:36:42] <PSI_Guy95> Lucas's PM kit was some shit. Like PSI Offense up as neutral B? Seriously?
[0:36:43] <+Personified134> Nintendo would never allow PM to be streamed at a tournament
[0:36:46] <+Personified134> guaranteed
[0:36:55] <%GabeSweetMan> LOL
[0:36:58] <SaltyDongs> eww this stream stinks sipsipRude
[0:37:00] <%TheMilhouseExperience> They still wen to the next game eventually though.
[0:37:00] <ManOfReason> "fuck third strike: LOL
[0:37:01] <+wal__rus> reggie is wise mangoTEAM mangoMELEE
[0:37:01] <smig> LUL
[0:37:03] <+mushymoto> LUL
[0:37:03] <mr_miyagichu> Brawl was literally made TO OPPOSE what melee players liked about melee
[0:37:06] <bearwagon> hindsight is 20/20
[0:37:09] <+primax104> not just games, everything has it
[0:37:09] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[0:37:13] <%Crashfan01> Third strike SUCKS you guys!
[0:37:14] <+Kaiser_Loar> they sound like dsp
[0:37:15] <kenzaki_> Brawl is a fun netplay game though
[0:37:20] <iamtheTwitchghost> turd strike
[0:37:21] <+GuyQ> Melee is third strike. Brawl is sf2.
[0:37:21] <Xeno351> ask him about the only 5 viable characters
[0:37:21] <+wal__rus> brawl was literally trying to purge competitive players from the scene
[0:37:24] <ResidentSleeper22> LUL
[0:37:27] <+Nomicro4u> Kage too big to fit into frame
[0:37:28] <frogurtz> Sometimes the feel of the game just isn't for you.
[0:37:32] <DatAsuna> ST not at evo cause of french bread
[0:37:32] <kenzaki_> Playing Ganon, the literal bottom tier mirrors is the shit
[0:37:32] <nmaten> its like if SF went from Super Turbo to 5
[0:37:33] <%GabeSweetMan> It's official: 3RD Strike is the worst SF.
[0:37:33] <fairore> @kenzaki_ thats just not true
[0:37:42] <ShaykhSpear> GET GID
[0:37:45] <+wal__rus> there is no fgc comparison to smash bc nintendo didnt see smash as a competitive game
[0:37:45] <lukeyp95> Woolie knows if pat was here he'd shit on this whole conversation with his bullshit LUL
[0:37:47] <YeezusPieces1> Every new Street Fighter sucks and the old one was better. It always ahppens
[0:37:48] <Sir_Walrus> Tripping LUL
[0:37:49] <PSI_Guy95> Part of Brawl being slower is because they wanted that shit playable with the Wiimote like lmao no good game used sideways wiimote
[0:37:56] <+MisterAngryEyes112> It goes beyond getting gud, Tripping was literally cancer
[0:37:57] <supersugoisenpai1> Just got here, sure is smelly in here.
[0:37:58] <+Personified134> TRIPPING LUL
[0:38:00] <HanPaul> Sleep Fighter V ResidentSleeper
[0:38:05] <Biggredd87> @guyq Lmao no, Smash 64 is ST in this comparison
[0:38:09] <+attackofthesage> Brawl fundamentals are actually not even remotely close to melee fundamentals
[0:38:11] <@Solidus_113> These guys need to play foozies
[0:38:11] <+BraveThanatos22> I like how speed works for characters in Guilty Gear, but if you happen to pick a character with a lower movement speed than your opponent then that can be a factor to a game.
[0:38:11] <%oKentucky> oKentucky subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[0:38:14] <+Noponiz> they dont wanna play, so they dont
[0:38:16] <+mushymoto> T R I P P I NG atpCap
[0:38:20] <@akuda_bar> there's no excuse for tripping
[0:38:20] <%GabeSweetMan> God I forgot about the Wiimote for Brawl since I never used the f***ing thing.
[0:38:25] <kenzaki_> Tripping is so fucking funny lmfao
[0:38:29] <CaliforniaPotatoPowers> and Melee is not Smash
[0:38:30] <kenzaki_> Also who the hell used wiimote for brawl
[0:38:30] <lukeyp95> doesn't ganon have a chaingrab on samus
[0:38:34] <Spaffs> if a guy decides to keep playing a new game he likes yes, that's dope. but why act like people are OBLIGATED to play a different game they don't care for?
[0:38:38] <%GohanEgret> @kenzaki_ me
[0:38:39] <Sir_Walrus> Brawl had a literal random chance to just completely fuck up everything you were doing for no reason It's the worst thing ever lmao
[0:38:40] <+tygermom> they are very different games
[0:38:40] <$HentaiSenpai9K> That's why I never went pro. I had an opportunity but the toxic mentality of MLG didn't attract me at all
[0:38:42] <%theAncopro> hhmmmmmmmm *incredulously
[0:38:44] <+Pungulator> Smash 4 is kinda Ultimate
[0:38:46] <+Tbnero> to many damn clacky sounds @WoolieVersus
[0:38:47] <+MisterAngryEyes112> The 4 stock!
[0:38:50] <Nina96> gezz wooile..
[0:38:51] <PSI_Guy95> I didn't mind Wiimote+Nunchak but trying to make it playable with wiimote only is just silly
[0:38:51] <fairore> @akuda_bar you talking about random tripping?
[0:38:52] <pandangerous> when's brawl minus SwiftRage
[0:38:53] <r_Foeburden87> ugh
[0:38:54] <%GabeSweetMan> Tripping is one of the ONLY parts I think everyone universally agrees was bullshit nonsense.
[0:38:56] <+kravdra> so you mean five
[0:38:58] <%UrsulaCat> smash is smash is smash
[0:38:59] <Spaffs> a lot of the anti melee people are mad just about like, people PREFERRING melee, people who'd rather play melee than the others. they're an inch from saying "you're not allowed to like it anymore"
[0:38:59] <Greezey> y is pat not playing melee
[0:38:59] <@akuda_bar> @fairore yes
[0:39:02] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> melee HD tho
[0:39:05] <ShaykhSpear> cause its broken
[0:39:06] <%UrsulaCat> there is no difference between smashes
[0:39:06] <+WillStream> what is this and why does this has 900 viewers
[0:39:08] <+MisterAngryEyes112> Melee cannot be patched
[0:39:09] <CrackerJack450> I hope not
[0:39:11] <+PtetDorf> @lukeyp95 no brainlet shes like one of the only characters in the game he cant
[0:39:15] <@Solidus_113> Ultimate > 4 > Brawl > 64 > Melee
[0:39:18] <%TheMilhouseExperience> The movement in sf2 is not sf3.
[0:39:18] <mtsoro> IC comin' with desyncs
[0:39:20] <+mushymoto> is proper momentum and hit stun so much too ask for? :(
[0:39:24] <HanPaul> Mario Party > Smash
[0:39:25] <+President_Miyazaki> They wouldn't play melee HD, they need their CRTs
[0:39:25] <Sir_Walrus> Oh no
[0:39:29] <Spaffs> and? what's the big deal if it's broken and old? if people still prefer that specific game?
[0:39:30] <Sir_Walrus> Woolie boutta get wobbled
[0:39:32] <+AccioSkullar> WOBBLE HIM
[0:39:32] <@mothmandraws> make melee HD smash players refuse to play it because the upgraded sprites mess with their ability to read moves
[0:39:33] <lukeyp95> oh sorry. I was thinking of sheik my b @ptetdorf
[0:39:33] <+miyamotomusashi_> oh no not 64
[0:39:33] <+Friendlyjuice96> WOBBLE IHM
[0:39:35] <gunstar73> solidus cmon my guy
[0:39:36] <+Tbnero> if melee HD cameout the melee scene would still complain @WoolieVersus
[0:39:37] <@akuda_bar> the ultimate troll would be if they put tripping into the custom rulesets in the new game
[0:39:38] <ResidentSleeper22> WOBBLE HIM
[0:39:39] <+chaos5338> wobble him
[0:39:40] <+allups> omg i thought tht was his gf in the hood my bad
[0:39:42] <CerberusDriver> Melee HD wouldnt work because it 'wouldnt feel the same'
[0:39:42] <+PtetDorf> shiek cant either
[0:39:42] <ItsWugz> Nintendo supports ultimate, not melee
[0:39:44] <+PtetDorf> bruh
[0:39:44] <PirahnaPlantZaibatsu> WOBBLE Woolie!
[0:39:45] <gunstar73> 64 is literally trash
[0:39:47] <+MarkOfRambo> Plz no wobble
[0:39:47] <+Personified134> Imagine if people just played 3rd strike forever and supported 3rd strike tournaments as the big thing forever, and people complaining that they didn't want to play SF4 instead
[0:39:47] <Spaffs> melee is the only game where a subjective preference, saying "i'd rather play this than the other smash games", makes people super fucking mad.
[0:39:49] <%GabeSweetMan> wombo combo plz
[0:39:50] <Spaffs> i dont understand why
[0:39:50] <+MisterAngryEyes112> Wobble him so he can feel why its been banned LUL
[0:39:53] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> chat they're canadian wobbling is banned naroSmug
[0:39:59] <lukeyp95> he definitely has cg on sheik lol
[0:40:00] <+Noponiz> DO ARCADE MODE
[0:40:03] <+primax104> lol, Nintendo's intentions seem pretty clear...
[0:40:04] <%theAncopro> Volcano only
[0:40:11] <Spaffs> i'd take the side of the 3rd strike guys. people should be allowed to keep playing games they prefer more
[0:40:14] <+ThePayphone> enjoying whatever game you like including shrek super slam > any other argument :)
[0:40:16] <moogleboy1984> okay, so reading more about this Collision thing, they both sound like asshats
[0:40:17] <+Grayhammatter> nintendo want
[0:40:18] <Spaffs> if a dinosaur dislikes 4 enough not to play 4, that's fine
[0:40:20] <+Personified134> oh no
[0:40:21] <Amaterasu98> Kage why are you so sick?
[0:40:22] <+shOokDK> do a wavedash
[0:40:22] <%GabeSweetMan> DO WOBBLE
[0:40:22] <+mushymoto> @spaffs no other smash feels like melee
[0:40:22] <Sir_Walrus> Oh no
[0:40:23] <ShaykhSpear> why melee smell
[0:40:23] <matouci> WOBBLE
[0:40:26] <@akuda_bar> demonstrate the wobble
[0:40:26] <Spaffs> yeah

[0:40:29] <+thackattack00> how do wavedash
[0:40:29] <AncelDeLambert> what type of soap do you use?
[0:40:29] <+Grayhammatter> they want nothing to do with melee
[0:40:30] <Biggredd87> A lot of anti melee mentality is rooted in old memes and perceptions that people have without really understanding
[0:40:30] <@akuda_bar> everyone wants to see it
[0:40:31] <+ledgefiend> @WoolieVersus will you guys play netplay with chat
[0:40:32] <+PenmanLupine> How many bars of soap do you have to throw away before your a pro player?
[0:40:33] <pandangerous> WOBBLE HIM SwiftRage
[0:40:34] <%GabeSweetMan> Make him feel the suffering of Wobble.
[0:40:36] <MattriX77> Is the Melee hate unwarranted?
[0:40:37] <TehBlueness> its not a question but kage i love you
[0:40:37] <+Pungulator> Is Melee better than Slap City
[0:40:38] <+Checktrap> What is Reggie doing this weekend ???
[0:40:38] <PSI_Guy95> What's the coldest worst Smash take you have ever seen
[0:40:40] <gunstar73> wobble him
[0:40:40] <mtsoro> Can we see a wobble on Woolie?\
[0:40:40] <%UrsulaCat> what is melee
[0:40:41] <%Gogogolem> @WoolieVersus Why do Melee players refuse to bathe?
[0:40:43] <lukeyp95> wobble Woolie for the funnies
[0:40:48] <+thackattack00> Brawl is the best smash wym
[0:40:50] <The1WhoKnoxx> will it ever go to project melee completely
[0:40:50] <+chaos5338> is melee not meant for digital consoles?
[0:40:50] <%UrsulaCat> when is liam smash
[0:40:50] <nmaten> RIP PM

[0:40:52] <@Menitta> mmmmm
[0:40:53] <SGrim> @WoolieVersus why is Bowser the best character? rooSmug
[0:40:53] <%GingaNZ> How much money do you think french bread has?
[0:40:54] <%strugglepunk2> So what's the differences that make Melee so much difference to later smashes? @WoolieVersus
[0:40:58] <%UrsulaCat> when is sonic shuffle
[0:40:58] <ShaykhSpear> is melee players part of the fgc as a whole?
[0:41:01] <pandangerous> brawl minus Kreygasm
[0:41:01] <VorpalSlash> BANNED
[0:41:01] <Xeno351> why do people love jerking off the top players?
[0:41:02] <Zepik> what is the best of the other smashes in your opinion
[0:41:02] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus How do they feel about both the new smash games and melee sharing evo for so long?
[0:41:02] <Dumple_Roe> when Melee minus
[0:41:03] <nathorz1> W O B B L E
[0:41:06] <+mushymoto> brawl needed to be balanced atpCap atpCap
[0:41:08] <+Tbnero> how are mods considered tournament viable
[0:41:09] <+AccioSkullar> PM isnt actually banned tho
[0:41:10] <%UrsulaCat> @WoolieVersus WHEN IS SONIC SHUFFLE
[0:41:11] <%Wool> PM is currently being patched by the community and is called Project Plus now
[0:41:11] <%Crashfan01> a collision happened?
[0:41:11] <arkv01> NINTENDO POLICE COMIN FOr U
[0:41:12] <Spaffs> ask Kage how he feels about ledge trumping
[0:41:17] <fairore> @xeno351 wait what
[0:41:18] <hntronium> DONT SAY SHIT
[0:41:19] <Biggredd87> THATS GETTING BANNED
[0:41:20] <+AccioSkullar> there have been tournies on twitch recently
[0:41:21] <+primax104> this stuff is so prolific.
[0:41:22] <%Paralurx> modders need to learn to SHUT THE FUCK UP
[0:41:23] <+miyamotomusashi_> melee minus already exists, its called sd remix
[0:41:25] <+AuriosVS> d'you guys feel brawl was slowed down from melee to appeal to a more casual audieence because that's the whole thing with the wii?
[0:41:27] <+President_Miyazaki> Why do people in the Melee community act like they are victims AND like they are better than the other fighting game communities so often?
[0:41:30] <PSI_Guy95> Nintendo modders love modding games and Nintendo hates modders modding their games, it's nuts
[0:41:30] <VorpalSlash> PM isn't banned but you can't have a sub button
[0:41:31] <AncelDeLambert> oh no, Woolie is Samus?
[0:41:31] <@Solidus_113> if you like pressing buttons in Melee, why not learn hyper fighters of the like?
[0:41:34] <+attackofthesage> You can MOVE in this game
[0:41:36] <AncelDeLambert> Woolieeeeeeeee
[0:41:36] <%blazymaniac> blazymaniac subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 3 months of motivation in! thanks for getting me a little into fighting games, as well as dmc and platinum games!
[0:41:39] <+Combat_Fries> @WoolieVersus do you think melee would be as good if you couldnt wave dash?
[0:41:39] <+BraveThanatos22> Stick or Pad?
[0:41:44] <+thackattack00> a bunch of glitches
[0:41:45] <reiju_22> WHO
[0:41:49] <PSI_Guy95> Vectoring, yeah
[0:41:50] <AncelDeLambert> Woolz, you're an embarrasment to the name of Aran
[0:41:50] <%Cavumentum> [REDACTED]
[0:41:51] <%laserbeaming> What do you guys think of Rivals of Aether and other smash substitutes?
[0:41:51] <Sir_Walrus> @President_Miyazaki because the melee community is more than one person
[0:41:52] <Biggredd87> Doki Doki Literature Club dev was one of the project m programmers
[0:41:53] <%GohanEgret> [redacted]
[0:41:57] <+MisterAngryEyes112> @President_Miyazaki It goes both ways, because they have been victimized and they have been massive cunts at times
[0:42:01] <lukeyp95> DI got changed
[0:42:03] <@mothmandraws> to me melee feels to fighting games what speed running is to normal games
[0:42:04] <straight_up_garbage> !uptime
[0:42:04] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @WoolieVersus do you think that Melee is much harder to get into than other smash games or fighting games? If so, what makes it worth it trying to get into a game people have had a 17 year head start on you in?
[0:42:05] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 42 minutes and 6 seconds
[0:42:08] <+shOokDK> later games reduced the angle of DI and added launch speed influence
[0:42:08] <ShaykhSpear> can't even explain LOOOL
[0:42:10] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Liam is often wrong than you think.
[0:42:10] <cero_5> vectoring got removed though
[0:42:11] <fairore> @solidus_113 cmonBruh
[0:42:11] <@Menitta> A major difference is lack of momentum and inertia in how you move aerially, right?
[0:42:12] <+Noponiz> vectoring got patched out though
[0:42:17] <HumungusPuffin> is that kage?
[0:42:19] <glorioushedonist> someone pause
[0:42:21] <Doc1790> Question: Why is playing Fox not considered a bitch move while Bayo is frowned upon?
[0:42:21] <YeezusPieces1> Is Melee really a fighting game or a party game configured to be a fighting game?
[0:42:21] <+Personified134> give Kage a controller so we can watch the chad display some real melee
[0:42:22] <%TheMilhouseExperience> More*
[0:42:22] <+shOokDK> pretty much everywhere
[0:42:23] <CastellanVon> @President_Miyazaki Because since the Melee comp community was created it's been treated like shit by the FGC and it's barely gotten better since 15 years ago.They're ALWAYS defending it.
[0:42:24] <+Jerimoi> whats keeping you guys away from ultimate?
[0:42:28] <+MisterAngryEyes112> @President_Miyazaki stop engaging in internal attribution bias
[0:42:33] <+shOokDK> and there's no buffering at all in melee, there's ridiculous buffering in the new games
[0:42:34] <Spaffs> @WoolieVersus do you guys at least see Ultimate as a better attempt at competitive smash than 4 and Brawl
[0:42:34] <+BraveThanatos22> Ultimate is fun.
[0:42:38] <+Combat_Fries> @Menitta correct
[0:42:39] <PSI_Guy95> Only good Smash 4 mechanic was Wario being able to use vectoring to reverse direction in midair
[0:42:44] <sunnythedrunk> @Jerimoi Most melee players also play ultimate
[0:42:51] <+AuriosVS> LCancelling is STUPID
[0:42:55] <+mushymoto> Ultimate is a fun party game :)
[0:42:55] <+BraveThanatos22> I'm new- Do people here not like Ultimate?
[0:43:00] <Dumple_Roe> what was the origins of wobble?
[0:43:01] <@Menitta> Yay I understand a thing
[0:43:02] <Amaterasu98> Auto-L canceling is the best solution
[0:43:03] <+AuriosVS> in design tbh
[0:43:07] <gunstar73> honestly worst part about ultimate is the buffer system
[0:43:10] <+Pungulator> @psi_guy95 You'd love the clutch mechanic in Slap
[0:43:11] <%Crashfan01> ultimate i great
[0:43:11] <lukeyp95> l-cancelling removal is fine tho, anyone who jerks off l-cancelling is a loser.
[0:43:12] <+attackofthesage> L canceling was intended and was plain bad design. Wave dashing was the result of the physics engine
[0:43:13] <kerwinftw> Hey y'all if anyone has any questions about melee they want to ask, y'all are free to whisper me as well. Been in the scene for a long while and would love to help people know wassup!
[0:43:13] <CastellanVon> Yeah Ultimate just cut landing lag like half for everything, it's great
[0:43:17] <Biggredd87> Auto l cancellation is the way to go
[0:43:20] <Sir_Walrus> Origins of Wobbling is an ice climbers player named Wobbles
[0:43:21] <kenzaki_> Yeah Ultimate is fucking dope, I just don't like the buffer system
[0:43:21] <%UrsulaCat> no I think they like ultimate
[0:43:22] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> IIRC landing lag in ultimate is less on average than L-canceled melee aerials
[0:43:23] <ManOfReason> to be fair, l canceling is dumb
[0:43:24] <+shOokDK> that's not how L cancelling worked, it had nothing to do with shielding. It was an intended mechanic
[0:43:26] <mtsoro> Would you compare Melee to MvC 2 in terms of the series evolution?
[0:43:27] <+Personified134> Ultimate is cool
[0:43:28] <%segbas2004> gotta love those clicky controller lol
[0:43:30] <HumungusPuffin> L cancelling is not bad design are you kidding me
[0:43:31] <+Personified134> melee is sick tho
[0:43:33] <+Combat_Fries> @kerwinftw who do u main
[0:43:34] <+Townspoon> @WoolieVersus Titanfall when Apex comes out. Melee when Ultimate comes out. WHY U DO DIS
[0:43:36] <+wal__rus> @shOokDK he was talkiong about 64
[0:43:42] <+MisterAngryEyes112> L cancelling is EXCEED LUL
[0:43:44] <PSI_Guy95> L-cancelling was shown on the Smash 64 website in Japan
[0:43:45] <+attackofthesage> Characters
[0:43:46] <+MisterAngryEyes112> In DMC
[0:43:49] <mr_miyagichu> @doc1790 fox has weaknesses that can be exploited such as his weak recovery and the fact that he falls fast so he gets combined hard from what I understand
[0:43:50] <toomuchstuffing> l cancelling is great
[0:43:51] <edward11231> nothing Kappa
[0:43:51] <VorpalSlash> Melee was literally called Marvel JR back in the day
[0:43:51] <@Menitta> Ha
[0:43:52] <+Jerimoi> is melee the third strike of smash ??
[0:43:57] <+mushymoto> Z and L cancels were on purpose
[0:43:58] <glorioushedonist> mad pat isnt here to voice his various melee opinions
[0:43:58] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:43:59] <%Wool> Are y'all going to play PM?
[0:44:00] <+shOokDK> @wal__rus Z cancelling was intentional too
[0:44:03] <kerwinftw> @combat_fries I've changed mains a lot, but right now I'm having a big Falco phase.
[0:44:10] <CastellanVon> Not EVERY character is fun to fight in ultimate but diversity is nice.
[0:44:10] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:44:10] <@mothmandraws> are these guys functions
[0:44:15] <+tygermom> the character diversity is also a problem
[0:44:16] <+attackofthesage> Ultimate has more characters, more stage diversity. Doesn't have the combo game or the movement system though
[0:44:22] <sir_nack> the fucky balancing is what turns me off of melee too
[0:44:22] <+tygermom> but its stil lnice
[0:44:23] <PSI_Guy95> Pat doesn't have Smash opinions, he just has Smash player opinions
[0:44:23] <+tygermom> nice
[0:44:25] <lukeyp95> roy might not be good in melee but he moves so nicely
[0:44:26] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> imagine if melee wasn't nintendo characters and was just rando anime characters or something
[0:44:27] <mtsoro> Yo, Marvel JR lol that's legit
[0:44:39] <Spaffs> combos in ultimate are like 2-3 moves that pair together well, then it kind of resets
[0:44:40] <%UrsulaCat> HAH HAH HAH
[0:44:41] <fairore> @attackofthesage that not true
[0:44:43] <Spaffs> but they feel really fucking good to use
[0:44:43] <%GohanEgret> @glorioushedonist to be fair, pat's beef isn't with melee, it's with the weird stuff about players/drama/controllers/etc.
[0:44:45] <nathorz1> AUUUUUGHHHH
[0:44:46] <+shOokDK> @tygermom top tier melee has at least 8 viable characters
[0:44:48] <kenzaki_> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug Some fucking dude is making a Smash clone that's just anime characters lmfao
[0:44:55] <Biggredd87> @woolieversus ask them about how fun Project M was. A lot of people love that game because it has melee gameplay with more characters
[0:45:00] <+Zamazardde> TOOOYAH
[0:45:02] <+bluetocho13> can we see one wobble this set
[0:45:02] <edward11231> Pichu fans would love ultimate the melee I'm sure
[0:45:03] <+Noponiz> kage doesnt play ultimate though. Dont think he has much of an opinion

[0:45:11] <arkv01> @kenzaki_ about fuckin' time we got some good anime
[0:45:12] <+Combat_Fries> @Spaffs maybe if your new... its just diffrent setups and resets the combos dont end

[0:45:28] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @kenzaki_ smash wouldn't be anywhere near as popular as it is today if it didn't have nintendo characters in it. See: PBASBR
[0:45:28] <ManOfReason> reggie speaking truth
[0:45:29] <kenzaki_> @arkv01 Bleach is in it though...
[0:45:30] <@mothmandraws> are melee players even really human
[0:45:32] <DatAsuna> Melee players demand special setups for just them
[0:45:32] <+gamerboy385> he's not wrong
[0:45:36] <nathorz1> Everybody hates
[0:45:39] <Spaffs> BY END i meant i more feel like the game soft caps how easy it is to chain a bunch of moves together @Combat_Fries
[0:45:40] <+mushymoto> the smell is loud Kappa
[0:45:45] <Trrecentric> Melee players aren’t any more toxic than any other community
[0:45:46] <+wal__rus> reggie is pretty wise

[0:46:02] <+BraveThanatos22> If you could play stick on Ultimate, would you?
[0:46:03] <+AuriosVS> to the melee guys, how's it feel to know that Roy and Pichu are arguable top 10 characters in Ultimate?
[0:46:03] <CaliforniaPotatoPowers> other games usually don't expect special privileges and willingly hold shit up for other games
[0:46:04] <%laserbeaming> WOOL
[0:46:04] <SilverInferno3> @hanzofiyuri Absolutely, viable stages that aren't just battlefield/FD reskins were very desired for Smash4

[0:46:26] <Spaffs> tf2 competitive had dudes in tournaments for a decade who just constantly called other players slurred and tried to insult them to get them to quick, melee doesn't seem exceptionally toxic

[0:46:33] <%GohanEgret> @MisterAngryEyes112 short for Woolz, aka Woolie
[0:46:36] <Xeno351> why did melee boo Guilty Gear at EVO?

[0:46:46] <+MisterAngryEyes112> @GohanEgret people spamming it tho
[0:46:47] <+tygermom> i'd say FGC people have thicker skin
[0:46:51] <+Personified134> when did melee ever boo GG
[0:46:52] <DatAsuna> @lukeyp95 that doesn't mean exclusive rooms and no freeplay
[0:46:55] <VorpalSlash> It's because Melee players were literally teenagers being dumb
[0:46:55] <frogurtz> The problem is that Melee players try to act like their game is above every single game which is bs.
[0:46:56] <+attackofthesage> Shine this man to oblivion lol

[0:47:08] <+MisterAngryEyes112> @GohanEgret fair nough LUL
[0:47:11] <nmaten> Most of the Melee community is dope as hell, some people are dicks tho
[0:47:11] <DatAsuna> divas getting mad that other peple can play the game too
[0:47:17] <+HeadsHeldHigh> oh no melee i can smell it from here Kappa
[0:47:24] <Spaffs> FGC comes from a much more rowdy culture of arcades im guessing, but with Melee the best players in the world were suburban kids in their rooms. they didn't have a culture that forcibly adjusted them to FRIENDLY trash talk
[0:47:26] <Nina96> all the FGC has haters
[0:47:31] <Spaffs> so people are either fragile or don't know what makes trash talk friendly
[0:47:32] <PlainSimpleTailor> apatDab Has everyone remembered their busted cheating controllers? apatDab
[0:47:32] <%Skullgod> if we judge melee community based on bad eggs, Low tier god should represent the entire fgc
[0:47:33] <+Nomicro4u> FGC THUGGERY
[0:47:35] <Spaffs> that's my guess
[0:47:37] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> the term "Johns" came from a melee player, so there's gotta be *some* toxic players naroSmug
[0:47:38] <MettleWolf> Melee seems to be the easiest to meme.
[0:47:45] <r_Foeburden87> YES
[0:47:46] <+Nomicro4u> WHOSE BITCH THIS IS
[0:47:47] <kerwinftw> @spaffs haHAA idk where you pulled that from
[0:47:51] <nathorz1> W O M B O C O M B O
[0:47:51] <+President_Miyazaki> But what about the fact that Evo champs are acting like that, like Armada calling other fighting game players sheep? I just don't see that that often in the other communities.
[0:47:57] <+kravdra> @Nomicro4u god like video
[0:48:00] <@mothmandraws> skull still not a mod
[0:48:00] <Spaffs> @kerwinftw entirely from my ass, i will admit it
[0:48:04] <lukeyp95> B I G L E F F
[0:48:04] <sunnythedrunk> Are they still talking about Armada's bad take from a month ago?
[0:48:07] <+tygermom> high learning curve
[0:48:08] <edward11231> Leffen needs to be more of a heel imo
[0:48:11] <+Lieutori> So basically, top level Melee players need to expand their horizons
[0:48:12] <+tygermom> that's melee's biggest problem
[0:48:15] <Spaffs> was just a guess
[0:48:15] <Sir_Walrus> Melee gets a bad rap for doing things that literally every other esports community does, but people say that Melee is worse because they hate that Melee isn't a traditional fighting game lmao
[0:48:16] <+mushymoto> the number of mf inputs
[0:48:17] <kerwinftw> @spaffs lol. at least you're honest
[0:48:17] <fairore> i thought leffen was playing other games
[0:48:18] <+Jerimoi> do melee players hate ultimate because they changed Fox's voice??
[0:48:23] <%Crashfan01> Hope we never stop talking about Armada's bad take
[0:48:23] <glorioushedonist> i loaded melee for the first time a couple days ago and HOW the fuck are they this fast
[0:48:26] <SchroedingersFerret> LTG isn't a smash player. Think about that.
[0:48:27] <%GohanEgret> wolf isn't in this so bye melee :p

[0:48:29] <+500ryu> hboxKappa
[0:48:32] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> IT'S NOT FUN GETTING JV5'ED BY A BALD GUY PLAYING PICHU OK
[0:48:33] <+attackofthesage> melee has an executional barrier that other smash games do not have, and neutral is something that doesn't come naturally in this game
[0:48:34] <+AccioSkullar> one of the newest top ten players started playing like 3 years ago so you're never too late
[0:48:39] <+attackofthesage> you actually gotta study it
[0:48:41] <Spaffs> OH DUDE REPLAYING MELEE, after not playing it for a decade, i S'D against the first Classic Mode CPU i fought

[0:48:47] <@mothmandraws> pogchamp
[0:48:49] <@akuda_bar> my theory is that there's clearly two different ways to play melee, and pro players get this major ego break when they're always seen as basically playing comp mario party by everyone else

[0:48:51] <PirahnaPlantZaibatsu> Zain hasn't even been playing long and he's top 10

[0:49:11] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus will Melee players reach the wholesome level of play Melty Blood does with hotel bathroom tourneys?
[0:49:12] <+Thomzzz> sound?
[0:49:21] <+tygermom> yeah there is an insane amount of variability to every exchange you just have to constantly learn and not slack off at all
[0:49:21] <@mothmandraws> No solidus
[0:49:24] <+Nomicro4u> Not showering is actually IRL tech, you use your smell to throw your opponent off game

[0:49:30] <cero_5> now you too can have years of research

[0:50:05] <Spaffs> @WoolieVersus if i play online is it guaranteed i'll only queue into people who have a decent mastery of the tech and stuff? Secondarily, how do you recommend people practice melee? There's a perception you have to get good at a lot BEFORE you start playing, paradoxically
[0:50:05] <+mugwugsampoo> 4Head
[0:50:07] <+Noponiz> @Solidus_113 they literally drive around when people put out their trash to collect CRTs from the garbage. They're already at crazy poverty
[0:50:09] <Spaffs> it's kind of a chicken or the egg situation
[0:50:14] <stoneham100> if it was easy to be upset, upsets wouldnt mean anything
[0:50:15] <+Dr_DangerPhD> @WoolieVersus what's worse, phantom hits or tripping?
[0:50:16] <bearwagon> all those compilations were hologram lies from the matrix AI

[0:50:19] <jotabranded> Wizz quit melee
[0:50:20] <%GabeSweetMan> cheer100 I feel that the Smash community is in a "This is Phil Fish" situation where no one pays attention when you're just being a normal community/person but the moment they fit the "_____ is toxic/an asshole" everyone piles onto the narrative as if that's the ONLY way they act. It doesn't make them non-toxic/assholes but they aren't exclusively toxic.

[0:56:49] <hanzofiyuri> @woolieversus When a meta is permanently set in stone, can it make the game kinda stale? I don’t hate melee, but whenever I saw top 8, it got kinda boring seeing the same people and characters in the end. The most exciting moment for me was AXE’s pikachu play, and that didn’t last too long.

[0:58:31] <+tygermom> hazards
[0:58:35] <nathorz1> Its not a stage its a level
[0:58:41] <bearwagon> i will always love melee for one reason and its pokefloats
[0:58:42] <+wal__rus> hazards
[0:58:44] <@mothmandraws> they shouldnt ban laggy stages its part of the game balance
[0:58:45] <LtSergei> it's a board
[0:58:47] <+tygermom> fuck pokemon stadium
[0:58:48] <ShaykhSpear> aight shits to smelly im out
[0:58:51] <labanderox> i always found the stage counterpicking weird @WoolieVersus why not do it like tekken where the legal maps are random
[0:58:53] <+tygermom> YES
[0:58:55] <+tygermom> BAN POKEMON
[0:58:57] <nathorz1> Its not a level its a world
[0:58:58] <laguerrilha> YES
[0:58:58] <+mandingowithplandingo> Some stages favor certain characters very heavily
[0:59:00] <DaGodKira> cuz its a forced ban for certain characters
[0:59:01] <+tygermom> MAN DF
[0:59:02] <+tygermom> FD
[0:59:04] <ResidentSleeper22> Kage going nuts
[0:59:05] <+tygermom> BAN FD
[0:59:06] <@mothmandraws> pokemon should be only lstage
[0:59:10] <PSI_Guy95> you want it as a "comeback" stage, not a equal-grounds stage
[0:59:13] <%GohanEgret> @nathorz1 it's not a world it's an arena
[0:59:17] <nathorz1> Its not a world its a zone
[0:59:17] <+wal__rus> @labanderox the stages are too different, and play to different characters strengths
[0:59:20] <Xeno351> because it advantages fox players and fox is all anyone plays
[0:59:21] <Sir_Walrus> Legal stages being random would be awful
[0:59:24] <ManOfReason> i mean we could just battlefield all day
[0:59:26] <Worldbrand> should just be poke floats
[0:59:26] <+thunderhog> I guess its like "hey i lost game 2, i get to play on a stage my character is better on"
[0:59:28] <CaliforniaPotatoPowers> why don't other games ban stages with counterpick advantage 🤔
[0:59:28] <+ledgefiend> @WoolieVersus they need 5 stages for a pick ban to exist
[0:59:30] <hntronium> The friendly fire is real
[0:59:35] <glorioushedonist> so much button clacking
[0:59:36] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Never mind the gymnastics continue.
[0:59:43] <+mandingowithplandingo> Having them as a neutral stage pick gives some matchups more than 1 extremely polarizing stage to start on
[0:59:50] <CastellanVon> There's just not enough stages in general, don't want to ban the few that are fine
[0:59:54] <Pnutz409> pk lol
[0:59:56] <+wal__rus> @thunderhog thats exactly what it is lol
[1:00:03] <@Menitta> @WoolieVersus Why arent the stages in Smash, not just melee, standardized to just FD/BF? I feel like it would provide a more simplified meta overall.
[1:00:15] <SilverInferno3> Woolie betraying his team, business as usual
[1:00:23] <labanderox> @wal__rus i mean, same thing with tekken, certain stages greatly prefer a cast of characters more than others
[1:00:25] <@Solidus_113> The Stage Morph option is the best thing to come out of game updates
[1:00:25] <fairore> @themilhouseexperience could you tell me what you mean
[1:00:29] <haisho> jetpaaaacks
[1:00:34] <kerwinftw> @menitta FD is arguably the least balanced legal stages
[1:00:34] <nathorz1> FF is on XD
[1:00:39] <gunstar73> cuz other stages allow for more advantages for ohter charactes mennita
[1:00:40] <%ninjanopee> ninjanopee subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[1:00:41] <fairore> i would really appreciate it

[1:00:52] <@Menitta> Regardless, why isnt it standardized
[1:00:53] <+Thatnerdyrunner> Thatnerdyrunner subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:00:53] <CastellanVon> @Menitta FD/BF aren't actually the most balanced stages. FD benefits campy characters heavily, BF benefits ladder heavy characters HEAVILY. But they still work
[1:00:57] <mayorrev> that ain't falco
[1:01:01] <gunstar73> different blast zones as well
[1:01:01] <Sir_Walrus> @Menitta because certain stages give a slight advantage toward certain characters, and a larger selection of stages allow for more characters to be viable
[1:01:15] <Evilkaz> Melee Gannon LUL who's this brave soul?
[1:01:15] <+RadDude6969> RadDude6969 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:01:16] <+wal__rus> @labanderox thats true but its a little too advantageous for certain characters in melee especially, like for example a puff getting random dreamland basically guarantees a win
[1:01:31] <%Dr00_PhD> good tech

[1:03:06] <edward11231> nothing Kappa
[1:03:08] <nmaten> hold down
[1:03:11] <Self_esteampunk> samus never dies
[1:03:12] <LtSergei> I just don't get why people choose to play a game that has significant amount of content they have to ban to make it fair
[1:03:12] <+thewaifoo> are they playing meta or casual?
[1:03:13] <+tygermom> Playing lame
[1:03:14] <PSI_Guy95> Super Bombjump as Samus looks cool?
[1:03:14] <Sir_Walrus> Samus is actually better than Ganon
[1:03:15] <fairore> @jumboman214 mmmm jumbo Kreygasm
[1:03:15] <gunstar73> cc thats it
[1:03:17] <+tygermom> recovery
[1:03:18] <hntronium> Lab time
[1:03:19] <%TheMilhouseExperience> @fairore there is so much mental gymnastics. It needs to be like this, but only like this, unless this happens. If it’s Friday that’s banned. Unless it’s the 3rd sunny day of April.
[1:03:21] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @labanderox with how smash works and how stages are varied, there are gonna be players/characters who do better/worse on different stages, no matter how balanced the game is
[1:03:24] <+Royalguard22> Need that Samus frame data
[1:03:26] <nmaten> if you di well you can live to 200+
[1:03:26] <+ledgefiend> @WoolieVersus isn't samus really hard to learn for competitve?
[1:03:27] <TryHardDaddyG> whats cc
[1:03:28] <CastellanVon> Oh yeah training mode is ass in Melee.
[1:03:31] <VorpalSlash> Samus is a Street Fighter character in Smash
[1:03:33] <LtSergei> is it because the gamecube didn't have any other games worth playing?
[1:03:36] <+felixayada> kirby monkaS
[1:03:37] <+Grayhammatter> oh no
[1:03:38] <Rhinoprotoss> Oh no
[1:03:38] <+tygermom> kirby is garbage
[1:03:38] <LtSergei> and they just got used to it
[1:03:39] <Sir_Walrus> Kirby LUL
[1:03:40] <kerwinftw> @ledgefiend no
[1:03:40] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> oh no
[1:03:40] <CastellanVon> Oh no

[1:03:45] <+MarkOfRambo> Kirby LUL
[1:03:45] <@akuda_bar> oh no
[1:03:47] <pazuuuzuuuu> you can turn off pause in melee?
[1:03:49] <cero_5> garbage character
[1:03:50] <+tygermom> kirby has nothing
[1:03:50] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @Noponiz
[1:03:51] <%Crashfan01> Kirbdon't
[1:03:51] <+MisterAngryEyes112> Close second to Pichu
[1:03:51] <labanderox> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug again, same thing with tekken
[1:03:52] <RollCritFail> Get stock lead, eat opponent, jump off side
[1:03:52] <Pnutz409> unless you're Izaw
[1:03:55] <+mandingowithplandingo> CC, great recovery, very heavy, and at an odd weight which makes her difficult to combo
[1:03:56] <gunstar73> literally trash
[1:03:57] <PSI_Guy95> Kirby was too good in 64
[1:03:58] <kerwinftw> Kirby is actually the worst character by far
[1:04:00] <+thunderhog> The WHAT
[1:04:01] <+Grayhammatter> the nintendome
[1:04:09] <@Menitta> Then I feel that if Marth is the best on FD, then Marth is the best. I don't like stage picks because now you have two matchups to learn.
[1:04:10] <PSI_Guy95> so they hit him with the nerfstick hard
[1:04:10] <pazuuuzuuuu> maybe that was puff
[1:04:10] <SilverInferno3> Kirby needed the nerf, he was too strong
[1:04:11] <+wal__rus> @labanderox yeah the ultimate stagelist is wayy more balanced
[1:04:12] <+attackofthesage> poor woolie LUL
[1:04:12] <+Hilleltaco> @pazuuuzuuuu I think you can in the other games too, but I might be wrong
[1:04:13] <SGrim> Teach this child rooDevil
[1:04:13] <VorpalSlash> Melee Kirby is a crime against nature
[1:04:13] <+ledgefiend> @WoolieVersus tell woolie about ginger! made it to number 1 in netplay with kirby only
[1:04:16] <+MisterAngryEyes112> You sure that wasn't Jigglypuff?
[1:04:18] <+tygermom> kirby was busted in 64
[1:04:21] <%Skullgod> mewtwo is way worse than kirby
[1:04:22] <@Menitta> The character and a stage
[1:04:22] <Pnutz409> lol vorpal
[1:04:22] <%segbas2004> THAT WAS THE SHIT
[1:04:23] <+tygermom> so they made her bad
[1:04:24] <%Skullgod> kirby at least has good tilts
[1:04:27] <alexandrecau> Trivia master Reggie
[1:04:29] <sunnythedrunk> Show him the the throws that don't work
[1:04:30] <@Menitta> It just makes it so intimidating to learn
[1:04:32] <+MisterAngryEyes112> Yeah this aint 64
[1:04:35] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @labanderox that's tekkens problem then naroSmug
[1:04:35] <gunstar73> im pretty sure that was puff woolies
[1:04:36] <@Menitta> Thats how I feel
[1:04:41] <GreatJumps> 2 Lucas enter 1 Ness leaves
[1:04:43] <JumboMan214> Yooooo LaRonde NINTENDOOOME
[1:04:46] <pazuuuzuuuu> never noticed that option
[1:04:47] <Rhinoprotoss> Kirby slow af
[1:04:50] <Pnutz409> lol great
[1:04:51] <+chubbypencil> KOFI DID IT. THE LEGEND
[1:04:59] <sosuke5> Kirby btfo
[1:05:02] <+mandingowithplandingo> Understandable, but the stages make the game much more interesting and fair for the cast
[1:05:02] <+thewaifoo> the game gets easier when l-cancelling becomes muscle memory
[1:05:03] <+BraveThanatos22> Kirby is like a cloud
[1:05:07] <Self_esteampunk> wah wuh
[1:05:08] <+mandingowithplandingo> Stages are a huge deal in Melee
[1:05:10] <bubutt> Try back throwing off stage to win Woolie
[1:05:14] <nmaten> "competitive"
[1:05:14] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> kirby also doesn't have a super jank bair and an insta kill that comboes from a throw on some of the best characters
[1:05:18] <+thewaifoo> but honestly the only tech anyone in smash should know is DI
[1:05:22] <%linkwolf4> his smile and optimism: fucking BODIED woolieDATTEBAYO
[1:05:22] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:05:23] <gunstar73> lol no one
[1:05:24] <+BraveThanatos22> Jigglypuff is like a solid being
[1:05:26] <+wal__rus> triple R is sick
[1:05:28] <labanderox> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug ehhh oh well, not like its gonna change anytime soon either way
[1:05:31] <+wal__rus> a kirby beat a drunk armada
[1:05:33] <Pnutz409> lol
[1:05:36] <+Papafleish> this isn't aracana heart love max wtf
[1:05:39] <@Menitta> That i wont disagree, it does make the game more interesting as a spectator at least
[1:05:42] <SuperKirby24> the sound of woolie's heart breaking over kirby is real Kappa
[1:05:42] <Sir_Walrus> Triple R my dudes
[1:05:42] <cero_5> two of his throws dont even work
[1:05:49] <+BraveThanatos22> Is Kirby like Panda inTekken in terms of Tiers?
[1:05:56] <CastellanVon> The Armada
[1:05:59] <+wal__rus> kirby is a broken character in the worst way
[1:06:00] <Sir_Walrus> CC downsmash
[1:06:03] <CastellanVon> The MacD
[1:06:04] <+thewaifoo> how to play samus, crouch cancel downsmash LUL
[1:06:13] <+mandingowithplandingo> Not familiar with Tekken, but Kirby sucks
[1:06:16] <@Menitta> Man I love this stage
[1:06:19] <+wal__rus> CC LUL
[1:06:21] <fairore> you can as Kirby in ultimate woolie
[1:06:25] <+wal__rus> CC DOWNSMASH WOOLIE
[1:06:41] <kerwinftw> stadiun WutFace
[1:06:52] <+AuriosVS> shit gets unsafe on hit when you crouch
[1:06:52] <gunstar73> @menitta the way people charcaters is super different compared to other smash games and those differences are really cool
[1:07:08] <Pnutz409> I never knew...
[1:07:09] <+SWindleFeD> God damn that's a big boy on the right
[1:07:13] <+eagleclassgamer> @WoolieVersus call PeachSaliva and tell her to hack into Pat's stream and host you.
[1:07:15] <+wal__rus> not multihits or spikes
[1:07:23] <bubutt> Really hoping we get the Ultimate equivalent of this. w
[1:07:27] <cero_5> it's better in ultimate that it was in games after brawl but nowhere near as strong as in this
[1:07:28] <gunstar73> legit all top foxes play way different from each other
[1:07:34] <@Solidus_113> this is stupid
[1:07:37] <Sir_Walrus> Using one move repeatedly
[1:07:39] <cero_5> or after melee I mean
[1:07:43] <+MisterAngryEyes112> Melee has a STYLE METER LUL
[1:07:46] <arkv01> I am learning more about melee on this stream than I have the past decade
[1:07:47] <kerwinftw> 9
[1:07:52] <kerwinftw> the stale stack is 9
[1:07:56] <sunnythedrunk> Stale moves don't matter that much in melee
[1:08:08] <+thewaifoo> ^
[1:08:09] <kerwinftw> @sunnythedrunk matters a lot with falco shine
[1:08:22] <gunstar73> also edgehog exists in melee
[1:08:26] <+mandingowithplandingo> The only time I can think of where staking matters in Falco’s wack shine, where they escape the hitstun
[1:08:27] <+attackofthesage> @arkv01 we haven't even gotten to the CRAZY stuff yet
[1:08:33] <+thewaifoo> wave shines sort of fixes it
[1:08:33] <@Solidus_113> Except SG's anti-infinite tech doesn't work because resets are so easy
[1:08:35] <+mandingowithplandingo> Staling matters*
[1:08:38] <+eagleclassgamer> @WoolieVersus call PeachSaliva and tell her to hack into Pat's stream and host you.
[1:08:42] <gunstar73> i really don't like no edgehog in ultimate
[1:08:43] <CastellanVon> Stale moves are a lot more important in Smash 4.
[1:09:00] <JumboMan214> Ganon is so bad in this game :(
[1:09:05] <Acrimon> man i hate this game
[1:09:09] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Is it just in damage or is speed involved in degradation too?
[1:09:09] <+thebonebard> i gpt very confused when he said peach
[1:09:12] <kerwinftw> not an option select
[1:09:13] <spardanwarrior> @eagleclassgamer he's already hosting Woolie
[1:09:15] <didgereedoodah> SG anti-infinite system doesn't even stop infinites
[1:09:22] <+AllenAfro> its armor basically
[1:09:26] <didgereedoodah> it just gives you a bad burst
[1:09:27] <twoah> Woolie figured it out. Smash has a style meter PogChamp
[1:09:28] <+thewaifoo> i legit thougth sbfp hated melee, glad to see they're giving it a chance
[1:09:35] <nmaten> you can still cc things that send up
[1:09:36] <cero_5> ledgehog is strictly better than ledgetrump
[1:09:39] <SilverInferno3> @thewaifoo It's just Pat lol
[1:09:39] <+mushymoto> melee ganon is a style monster
[1:09:53] <gunstar73> yes ledgehog is so good
[1:09:55] <%king_wragles> king_wragles subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! 4 months! Quick question, will Baba is You be a stream or a LP?
[1:10:03] <DotMatrixLeviathan> why is woolie playing melee
[1:10:05] <+eagleclassgamer> @spardanwarrior thank you for letting me know. Pat will be spinning in his grave as soon as he finds out.
[1:10:06] <+Noponiz> think of crouching as a focus attack at low %
[1:10:06] <CastellanVon> Oh no Pat still hates the Competitve Smash and won't ever give it the same chance Woolie is. Liam was actually into comp Melee and Brawl for a bit.
[1:10:07] <+Hilleltaco> @thewaifoo None of them hate any Smash game, Pat just doesn't like the melee community
[1:10:07] <fairore> @thewaifoo that was just pat being pat
[1:10:14] <kerwinftw> Smash with analog stick allows charging
[1:10:21] <sunnythedrunk> You can cc with the analog stick
[1:10:22] <gunstar73> i hate giving ledge for free in ultimate
[1:10:26] <Sir_Walrus> The C stick is goldy
[1:10:27] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> you can't charge smash attacks with the c stick tho naroSmug
[1:10:27] <Timmaahh97> I’m in class and have no audio wtf are they doing lol
[1:10:29] <CastellanVon> The SBFP fanbase LOATHES Melee.
[1:10:29] <manstertruck> Woolie doesnt understand
[1:10:30] <Sir_Walrus> godly
[1:10:33] <menacingsleeveless> wish I had a diet coke rn
[1:10:35] <sunnythedrunk> C stick is just easier
[1:10:36] <PlainSimpleTailor> Using the Dpad risks accidental taunts
[1:10:36] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @Timmaahh97 playing melee
[1:10:38] <nmaten> certain tech is a lot easier depending on what stick you use
[1:10:39] <+eagleclassgamer> @CastellanVon its even better because Patstaresat is hosting him
[1:10:49] <@mothmandraws> smash just sounds like speedrunning glitches
[1:10:50] <manstertruck> He thinks they mean you can cc during the smash attack
[1:10:56] <RuruLMF> Reggie, viens on parle français un peu
[1:10:59] <Gaming_W4rrior> @Timmaahh97 training/ going over mechanics
[1:10:59] <+mandingowithplandingo> You can charge smashes with the analog stick
[1:11:06] <+Hilleltaco> Despite his shit talking, Pat has always liked Smash
[1:11:13] <$Noponiz> cheer100 fun fact: Kirby hasnt been above subpar since melee in any game! Also think of low% crouch cancelling like a focus attack kiiiinda
[1:11:18] <+mandingowithplandingo> You have to hold Z
[1:11:18] <cero_5> that shorthop macro is so stupid lol
[1:11:21] <Pnutz409> is it better to use c stick for tilts or smashes?
[1:11:22] <Timmaahh97> Okay lol I was so confused
[1:11:23] <drybowser34> What about weight stats
[1:11:24] <Sir_Walrus> SHFFL
[1:11:28] <cosmictrashcan> @mothmandraws that's exacly what makes it so cool, i never understand when people say that as a negative
[1:11:28] <+MisterAngryEyes112> SHFFL
[1:11:30] <nmaten> we shffl bois
[1:11:34] <%Toynota10> @woolieversus does Samus really have a sex kick or did Woolie make that up?
[1:11:36] <kerwinftw> @pnutz409 cstick only does smashes in melee
[1:11:37] <+mushymoto> connecting the dots LUL
[1:11:37] <ManOfReason> LOL
[1:11:38] <manstertruck> cc just makes moves unsafe on hit
[1:11:39] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @mothmandraws yeah but glitches can make things cool tho. Look at devil may cry!
[1:11:39] <SilverInferno3> SHFFL
[1:11:40] <nmaten> melee is SICK
[1:11:41] <Plague_Nurse> Pat just loves the salt from the melee community cause they're easy to piss off
[1:11:44] <kerwinftw> @toynota10 she does have a sex kick
[1:11:46] <+thewaifoo> i think Woolie's more of a falco guy if he likes pulling sick shit
[1:11:51] <+supaXmugen> @mothmandraws I think id rather have that than what Ultimate does, which is basically hold you down and not allow you to do anything.
[1:11:53] <fairore> void almost got beat by a kirby last tournament
[1:11:59] <kerwinftw> @toynota10 so does mario, link, sheik, fox, falco, young link
[1:11:59] <drybowser34> Show bowser
[1:12:01] <PSI_Guy95> I unironically love all the clickedy clacking
[1:12:01] <MettleWolf> Listen to those controllers
[1:12:06] <+attackofthesage> Samus SHFFL Nair is pretty standards
[1:12:12] <+attackofthesage> standard*
[1:12:16] <kerwinftw> @toynota10 dr. mario has a reverse sex kick
[1:12:23] <%Kisabuza> keep in mind woolly is a 34 year old man whose wrists will explode from trying melee combos
[1:12:23] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:12:25] <+thewaifoo> melee click/clacks is asmr to me at this point lol
[1:12:27] <%Toynota10> what does it mean tho?
[1:12:31] <stoneham100> samus's dd isnt too good
[1:12:31] <+LordOffel> @attackofthesage is it? woudlnt you rather play platforms with side-b?
[1:12:33] <@mothmandraws> so why are some glitches fine and others are not (ie the argued about wabbling)
[1:12:35] <SilverInferno3> @PSI_Guy95 Same, it's strangely soothing
[1:12:41] <+supaXmugen> Part of the reason i sold off my copy of Ultimate was because of how crap the controls are.
[1:12:41] <kerwinftw> @toynota10 it gets weaker the longer the hitbox stays out
[1:12:42] <bubutt> !uptime
[1:12:42] <+mushymoto> @toynota10 positioning
[1:12:42] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 12 minutes
[1:12:42] <Pnutz409> @kerwinftw thanks! really interesting game.
[1:12:43] <CastellanVon> Marth DashDancing Kreygasm
[1:12:46] <gunstar73> yea the clicks best part of smash
[1:12:50] <Spaffs> @mothmandraws i'd say it's fundamentally SUBJECTIVE, which makes a lot of people mad
[1:12:51] <JumboMan214> Waifoo are you saying black people play Falco
[1:12:52] <Spaffs> but it comes down to
[1:12:52] <Sir_Walrus> It's movement and mental stuff
[1:12:53] <%Toynota10> lol got it
[1:12:55] <+westisonfire> Hey woolz <3
[1:12:57] <Spaffs> "this glitch makes the game more fun"
[1:12:58] <drybowser34> Can bowser dashdance
[1:13:01] <Spaffs> "this glitch tho makes things less fun"
[1:13:01] <Raldavar> but when does the tech change this to DBZ though?
[1:13:01] <+MisterAngryEyes112> @mothmandraws because wobbling is not a glitch its clever abuse of game mechanics
[1:13:01] <+attackofthesage> @LordOffel That's how you zone them. SHFFL nair works if they approach or screw up their combo time
[1:13:03] <sunnythedrunk> @mothmandraws Melee is a jank game with no similar ruleset precedent so it's always argued on
[1:13:05] <fairore> @supaxmugen i guess man
[1:13:06] <kerwinftw> @pnutz409 np! feel free to dm me any questions you might have! been playing for a long time
[1:13:12] <+AccioSkullar> the issue with wobbling is that its the only actual infinite I guess, in a super summarized way
[1:13:13] <+thewaifoo> @mothmandraws same reasons why some fgc games ban infinite. you cant get out of it
[1:13:13] <gunstar73> marth grab range in ultimate lffnLUL
[1:13:15] <+LordOffel> @attackofthesage ohhh ok, I am not a samus player
[1:13:17] <nmaten> in melee its almost always better to use movement to force whiffs as opposed to blocking
[1:13:18] <+supaXmugen> @mothmandraws its not so much the glitches but the fact that you have so many options and abilities to control characters
[1:13:19] <+bear_breaker20> clickclack goes my paddy wack Kapa
[1:13:20] <+mandingowithplandingo> @mothmandraws The argument against wobbling is that it oversimplifies ICs as a character and is shitty to watch
[1:13:21] <%Skullgod> guys stop talking to mothman about melee he just wants to meme on it
[1:13:24] <+Triforce505> Triforce505 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:13:25] <+bear_breaker20> Kappa
[1:13:27] <@mothmandraws> in theory if there was a glitch/tech/something found that just insta killed the opponent is that abuse or tech
[1:13:27] <%Skullgod> he doesnt actually care
[1:13:34] <ManOfReason> @mothmandraws the community decides if the glitch is fun or not, kinda like fuzzy mixup in sf
[1:13:36] <+MisterAngryEyes112> Got it
[1:13:36] <+mandingowithplandingo> It’s been in the talks of being banned lately, but it’s not 100%
[1:13:37] <+yamham63> Melee PogChamp
[1:13:38] <+AccioSkullar> that would obviously be banned lmao
[1:13:38] <@mothmandraws> im actually asking legit
[1:13:43] <@mothmandraws> I just want to know the extremes
[1:13:43] <+attackofthesage> @LordOffel Yeah I'm not either but I play against one. I also like to SHFFL uair into grab or fsmash
[1:13:43] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @mothmandraws there is it's called wobbling
[1:13:44] <kerwinftw> @mothmandraws depends
[1:13:46] <nmaten> @mothmandraws that exists and is banned
[1:13:48] <+supaXmugen> @mothmandraws thats a problem yes
[1:13:48] <CastellanVon> Yeah, IC Freeze Glitch is an instant kill and it's banned
[1:13:50] <gunstar73> thata pretty much wobbling moth
[1:13:57] <PSI_Guy95> like all competitive rules it's just trying to find a way to make the game fun to play
[1:13:58] <ManOfReason> @mothmandraws wobbling is generally not fondly thought of
[1:13:59] <@mothmandraws> im just wondering where people draw the line
[1:14:06] <+LordOffel> @attackofthesage everyone in my region plays space animals soooo
[1:14:12] <CastellanVon> Wobbling is an infinite, it's not a glitch.
[1:14:15] <+mushymoto> dacus PogChamp
[1:14:16] <@mothmandraws> of what is tech and what is abuse
[1:14:17] <NeddTheNerd> How can I crouch cancel and then downsmash ?
[1:14:18] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> evidently people draw the line at wobbling
[1:14:18] <+supaXmugen> @mothmandraws but you cant introduce excess input lag and ridiculous buffered input times to compensate
[1:14:19] <SilverInferno3> @mothmandraws From what I understand wobbling literally stops the opponent from playing the game so it's def an extreme
[1:14:25] <+supaXmugen> Thats the problem of ultimate
[1:14:27] <viceroi93> you guys only using 1 yeti? you guys sound crisp
[1:14:31] <%Skullgod> IC Freeze Glitch is banned and not wobbling because the Freeze Glitch can permantely freeze the character and make the match unplayable
[1:14:32] <+attackofthesage> @LordOffel I've been playing long enough that I can play anyone really
[1:14:32] <gunstar73> it took a guy like a day to learn wobbling
[1:14:34] <%Skullgod> unlike wobbling
[1:14:39] <nmaten> theres a clear line i think the only thing really up for debate is wobbling which is an infinite off of a grab
[1:14:42] <kerwinftw> @mothmandraws stuff that doesnt have counterplay is usually a dece rule of thump

[1:18:06] <@mothmandraws> @WoolieVersus ask then if they think melee will be on google stadia
[1:18:07] <+thewaifoo> i legit thought shield grabs was intentional
[1:18:07] <SilverInferno3> @DFDEDSDCD Because it's the hypest bugs you'll ever see
[1:18:11] <Vashido22> did I join in to SOME T E C H
[1:18:12] <gunstar73> ita just memes

[1:18:21] <noahwars2> does anyone play ultimate
[1:18:41] <+mandingowithplandingo> Both the super wavedash and the extender are purely for style. They are never used beyond that
[1:18:48] <fairore> @noahwars2 i do
[1:18:49] <SilverInferno3> is that even a reference to metroid lol
[1:18:52] <Sir_Walrus> @WoolieVersus does woolie even know about wavedashing yet lmao
[1:18:55] <+MisterAngryEyes112> Yeah this game is insane
[1:19:00] <pazuuuzuuuu> how's that an easter egg? is that from a metroid game?
[1:19:03] <kerwinftw> @castellanvon Idk I think extender has some uses, but definitely not a staplem
[1:19:04] <Pnutz409> lol
[1:19:04] <PSI_Guy95> it's pointless but very cool
[1:19:05] <+attackofthesage> It's for styling
[1:19:12] <+attackofthesage> Samus has a lot of styling stuff
[1:19:17] <korsablade> ^
[1:19:18] <+mushymoto> Ssstylin
[1:19:20] <%Biggredd87> ITS FOR STYLE
[1:19:28] <%Biggredd87> MELEE IS DMC GODDAMMIT
[1:19:28] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:19:30] <MettleWolf> Smokin Sexy Samus
[1:19:34] <sunnythedrunk> It's cool for grabbing off platform
[1:19:37] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> melee jank is so good, yoshi's running grab doesnt even work half the time
[1:19:40] <NumberTooBig> Intwntional easter eggs you guys Kappa
[1:19:43] <+Friendlyjuice96> there are a few samus mains who use it effectively
[1:19:55] <CastellanVon> There is more potential for style in Melee than in any other fighting game.
[1:19:56] <PSI_Guy95> "MELEE IS DMC" if this caught on I think Pat's head would catch on fire
[1:19:56] <+Pungulator> Anyone know when Slap City is starting?
[1:19:56] <+Ace5335> @WoolieVersus show marth grab
[1:20:05] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @WoolieVersus you guys should show woolie that gif of Yoshi's grab vs Marth's grab
[1:20:08] <ManOfReason> OLOLLO
[1:20:09] <+attackofthesage> Yeah Yoshi dash grab doesn't work because of it's positioning on the z axis lol
[1:20:10] <Pnutz409> lol
[1:20:10] <Sir_Walrus> lmfao
[1:20:11] <%Triforce505> that doesn't sound like an easter egg
[1:20:15] <+MisterAngryEyes112> Honestly Melee has about as much style as DMC LUL
[1:20:15] <dr4g0nb0rn0> @woolieversus you guys should try the black hole glitch
[1:20:16] <pazuuuzuuuu> come on that's not an easter egg lol
[1:20:17] <+tygermom> SHOW HIM MARTHS GRAB RANGE
[1:20:21] <+mrcooperblack> talk about how broken marth is PLEASE
[1:20:22] <AncelDeLambert> look at this glitchy cheaty shit
[1:20:26] <Noponiz> it's literally an easter egg
[1:20:28] <PSI_Guy95> @WoolieVersus show them how the z axis affects attacks like Yoshi's grab
[1:20:28] <+AccioSkullar> MARTH MARTH MARTH
[1:20:30] <@mothmandraws> people doubt if smash is a fighting game, I am wondering if its even a game
[1:20:31] <%Triforce505> that's definetly just broken shit
[1:20:31] <+AuriosVS> SHE HAS URIENS MOVESET
[1:20:32] <CastellanVon> It's an easter egg that got removed in PAL iirc.
[1:20:35] <NumberTooBig> Easter eggs, everyone LUL
[1:20:36] <pazuuuzuuuu> that's like wavedash being an easter egg
[1:20:36] <nmaten> Samus is a zoner for sure
[1:20:41] <+DFDEDSDCD> @WoolieVersus It's a buggy mess of a party game that has some unintended mechanics that make it one of the fastest and most technical fighting games if you decide to play it that way.
[1:20:42] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @mothmandraws melee isn't a game, it's a lifestyle
[1:20:46] <kerwinftw> @mothmandraws a way of life
[1:20:48] <+AccioSkullar> the extender isnt even good lmao
[1:20:52] <tungstenviper> Easter Egg about what? LUL
[1:20:57] <%Biggredd87> @psi_guy95 Dude that why I don’t understand pat’s hate for melee. The reason I love DMC is the same reason I love melee. Stylish combos
[1:21:01] <Sir_Walrus> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug pls no
[1:21:05] <+REALplastic> you can do a SUPER missle
[1:21:08] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> every glitch is an easteregg guys
[1:21:14] <@mothmandraws> pat hates the community really
[1:21:14] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> a lifestyle that involves copious amounts of BO
[1:21:17] <@mothmandraws> rather than game
[1:21:24] <pazuuuzuuuu> pat doesn't hate melee, he hates melee players
[1:21:28] <%Skullgod> Pat hates the game too im pretty sure
[1:21:29] <+tygermom> do it on platform stages is crazy
[1:21:35] <+elsievoid> Yeah he just likes making them mad
[1:21:35] <%Skullgod> he hates any type of movement tech not intended by developers
[1:21:36] <+tygermom> pat hates a lot of things
[1:21:39] <%TheMilhouseExperience> DMC degrades style not damage.
[1:21:41] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> pat doesn't hate melee, or melee players, he hates his *idea* of what melee players are
[1:21:41] <sunnythedrunk> Pat just enjoys hating on melee
[1:21:41] <+einheri> apatJpeg
[1:21:43] <Noponiz> pat is such an angry goblin
[1:21:46] <oaknveil> whos the guests?
[1:21:46] <%Skullgod> Slidehopping in Titanfall, bhpping in shooters, wavedashing, etc.
[1:21:50] <+tygermom> yet he doesn't hate guard flying lmao
[1:21:51] <sunnythedrunk> They did a fisticuffs
[1:21:52] <%Biggredd87> Its all mind goblins Kappa
[1:21:53] <Sir_Walrus> @woolieversus also the regular missile is almost completely worthless
[1:21:54] <cosmictrashcan> you can hate the community all you want but come on, melee is cool as fuck
[1:21:54] <didgereedoodah> reminder that pat actually loves smash, but not the competitive side
[1:21:55] <+Nomicro4u> Whats that smell?
[1:21:55] <hntronium> I support Pat's angry anti-melee rants
[1:21:57] <hntronium> Eat shit
[1:21:58] <+Nomicro4u> ITS SMASH
[1:21:59] <@mothmandraws> tbf skull only movement I hate is rocket jumps
[1:22:01] <SilverInferno3> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug This is it, chief
[1:22:02] <ManOfReason> well get pat hates dmc4 because of inertia
[1:22:03] <@mothmandraws> because I think its goofy
[1:22:05] <PlainSimpleTailor> apatFist apatWhat
[1:22:07] <CerberusDriver> Pat plays smash and thinks its fun
[1:22:16] <%Skullgod> i love all movement mechanics
[1:22:20] <+TheAlmightyCatGod> Is that Kage? nkoThink
[1:22:23] <%Skullgod> i like to moooovveee
[1:22:30] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> pat just hates melee players because he thinks that everyone who's ever touched a GC controller in their life is Armada at his worst personality-wise
[1:22:35] <smig> You're a monster moth
[1:22:41] <+DFDEDSDCD> Marth can turn around with his arials.
[1:22:48] <PSI_Guy95> Smash is half fig-I mean party game, half platformer. The movement is important. It needs to be fun in and of itself imo
[1:22:51] <%Biggredd87> @any_nep_subs_here_nepsmug Yeah that
[1:22:54] <kerwinftw> @any_nep_subs_here_nepsmug new here, who is pat?
[1:22:55] <nmaten> Movement is definitely the main appeal to melee over other smash games imo
[1:22:55] <+mandingowithplandingo> This is great to watch
[1:22:57] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Inertia is a bug in 4. Doesn’t offer much other than looking cool.
[1:23:07] <NumberTooBig> @any_nep_subs_here_nepsmug i mean, pat's never wrong not wrong Kappa
[1:23:13] <+tygermom> inertia offers A LOT
[1:23:14] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Except sky dancing*
[1:23:15] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @kerwinftw imagine the angriest person you know, except he's a tiny ginger who's more red bull than he is person
[1:23:21] <+Duckrobin> doing a reverse charge shot to turn around is faster
[1:23:21] <ManOfReason> @nmaten absolutely this
[1:23:22] <+tygermom> i wouldn't say it's just cool
[1:23:25] <kerwinftw> @any_nep_subs_here_nepsmug lolol ty
[1:23:40] <@mothmandraws> man its strange ppl here who dont know what super best friends play is
[1:23:41] <tUxUt> pat isnt that angry these days
[1:23:45] <Sir_Walrus> Pat is like most melee haters, in that he hates the idea of playing melee as a competitive fighting game
[1:23:52] <cero_5> like the swords lol, yeah the one viable sword guy in this game
[1:23:53] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> what's a Super Best Friends Play
[1:23:57] <+DFDEDSDCD> Has someone showed @WoolieVersus Ganon on Ice?
[1:23:58] <+mandingowithplandingo> Oh, is that what this is? I’ve heard of them before

[1:28:08] <@mothmandraws> im just making evo jokes
[1:28:08] <PSI_Guy95> I like seeing Woolie try to equate Melee terms/tech to traditional fighter stuff
[1:28:09] <+tygermom> Kage
[1:28:10] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> if melee got on stadia and they had a tournament it would probably be like 2 stock items on random stages like the nintendo ultimate national is
[1:28:15] <CastellanVon> Tripping was an advancement from Dash Dancing yep
[1:28:16] <cosmictrashcan> Newer interactions actually take away a lot of mechanics lol
[1:28:17] <@mothmandraws> psi
[1:28:18] <+SnapToFingergun> shield DI seems like a lot to show new players
[1:28:19] <manstertruck> It's 1 step forward 2 steps back with nintendo
[1:28:23] <@mothmandraws> woolie compars everything to fighting games
[1:28:25] <+AccioSkullar> bizz got bizzed on zfgSad

[1:29:06] <+DFDEDSDCD> dammit
[1:29:07] <viceroi93> high mid if you must
[1:29:08] <sunnythedrunk> Mid tier but she still makes top 8
[1:29:11] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> if you play samus you already have a positive MU against leffen
[1:29:12] <%linkwolf4> look at woolie picking boss characters AGAIN
[1:29:12] <+mandingowithplandingo> A Samus took a set from the #1 player in the world very recently
[1:29:18] <Sir_Walrus> Samus is at the bottom of high tier
[1:29:19] <NumberTooBig> @mothmandraws theres thw one FPS with a style meter
[1:29:19] <gunstar73> plup samus nairoGasm
[1:29:21] <+DFDEDSDCD> I thought I could get away with it, but you meddling bots!!
[1:29:29] <Sir_Walrus> Good samuses being Plup, Duck, and Hugo
[1:29:44] <Sir_Walrus> Plup only bringing her out rarely tho
[1:29:44] <+attackofthesage> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug lol are we like 2013 memes in here
[1:29:45] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> honorable mention to esam too
[1:29:52] <Nineball_Luce> I remember this Samus combo vid with the super wavedash edgeguards
[1:29:53] <+tygermom> LMAO
[1:29:53] <ResidentSleeper22> Plup Kreygasm
[1:29:55] <%TheMilhouseExperience> I don’t know Mothman. I’m still trying to convert woolies everything in soulsborne terms thing.
[1:29:56] <+Ace5335> marth is still my fav characters to watch
[1:29:58] <ManOfReason> OLOLOLOL
[1:30:00] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> I haven't watched melee since highschool I'm sorry
[1:30:03] <@mothmandraws> Woolie paused he has to jump off
[1:30:04] <gunstar73> plup in general nairoGasm
[1:30:08] <+tygermom> meteor go straight down but you can jump out of it
[1:30:10] <labanderox> speaking of which, why is the standard for smash a bo5? compared to normal fg's of Bo3?
[1:30:10] <cero_5> poor marss lol
[1:30:22] <@mothmandraws> anyway I gotta go chat be good
[1:30:25] <+DFDEDSDCD> He about to leave that those salty as fucks in the Melee Ragequit comp.
[1:30:28] <pazuuuzuuuu> poor marss? he won
[1:30:39] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Take care moth have a good week.
[1:30:40] <gunstar73> only top 16 is 3 out of 5
[1:30:45] <SilverInferno3> Bye Moth
[1:30:46] <+tygermom> no you just jump out of it
[1:30:46] <+sparkjavelin> you can use wavedash to grab the ledge when you're on stage trying to stop the opponent from grabbing the ledge
[1:30:58] <CastellanVon> Meteor Cancelling is bullshit.
[1:30:59] <cero_5> yeah but like, for getting involved in that situation
[1:31:04] <Sir_Walrus> @labanderox Melee matches are fast so we have time for Bo5s, which also gives some people more time to really get into their groove
[1:31:05] <+attackofthesage> Falco dair is one of the most abusable moves in this game lol
[1:31:10] <Self_esteampunk> red jacket falco hype
[1:31:11] <+attackofthesage> you could win with just that
[1:31:11] <+tygermom> a lot of them will
[1:31:14] <+wal__rus> Marth's dair was turned into a meteor in the PAL version
[1:31:17] <Rhinoprotoss> Falco dair is so fun
[1:31:27] <+wal__rus> falco dair is the best spike in any smash game
[1:31:30] <+thewaifoo> Falco dair is big dick energy
[1:31:32] <gunstar73> other fgs not having 3 out of 5 is dumb especially when top 16 is being played
[1:31:40] <ManOfReason> LOLOL
[1:31:40] <+V_D_X> oh wtf that's kage
[1:31:40] <+DFDEDSDCD> True Falco there
[1:31:41] <+V_D_X> cool
[1:31:43] <Pnutz409> hehe
[1:31:44] <+tygermom> LMAO
[1:31:50] <gunstar73> nairoKick falco dair
[1:31:52] <kerwinftw> @v_d_x poggers
[1:31:56] <twoah> The finisher of the down version of Marth’s side b is also a spike
[1:31:57] <ResidentSleeper22> mangoDair mangoDair mangoDair mangoDair
[1:32:03] <labanderox> @Sir_Walrus isn't the average of melee matches 3-4 minutes?
[1:32:03] <CastellanVon> The difference between Meteor and Spike is just a difference in angle
[1:32:06] <kerwinftw> @twoah meteor
[1:32:09] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> isn't marth's down air a meteor instead of a spike on some versions
[1:32:12] <+V_D_X> kerwin Pog
[1:32:20] <+mandingowithplandingo> Yeah, it’s a meteor on PAL
[1:32:24] <+ForgeTacular14> Pikachu tailspike kinda
[1:32:27] <kerwinftw> vdx im craving melee
[1:32:29] <+attackofthesage> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug PAL jank marth yeah
[1:32:33] <%Skullgod> the meteor vs spikes terminology should be reversed and its always pissed me off
[1:32:34] <Pnutz409> wow
[1:32:38] <%Skullgod> you can stop a volleyball spike
[1:32:39] <pazuuuzuuuu> dang never there was difference
[1:32:40] <%Skullgod> you legit
[1:32:42] <RZRtv> @castellanvon you can jump out of meteors but not spikes
[1:32:43] <%Skullgod> cant stop a meteor
[1:32:47] <labanderox> like i'd understand it with BBtag that game's matches last under a minute to justify a Bo5
[1:32:48] <ManOfReason> @Skullgod this is true, its kinda dumb
[1:32:50] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> not with that attitude
[1:32:52] <+thunderhog> a nipple spike cirLewd
[1:32:58] <@Menitta> Sex kick tho
[1:32:59] <Madbearv> go take a bath woolie
[1:32:59] <%Skullgod> @ManOfReason ive played melee for like 5 years
[1:33:02] <%Skullgod> and ive gone off
[1:33:04] <%Skullgod> every time
[1:33:05] <@Menitta> Sex kick into nipple spike
[1:33:07] <%Skullgod> i will die on this hill
[1:33:07] <Sir_Walrus> Tbf I'm mostly comparing this relative to other smash games Idk how smash FGC matches are lol
[1:33:07] <PSI_Guy95> sex kick into nipple spike
[1:33:08] <+MisterAngryEyes112> meteors can be the size of pebbles though
[1:33:12] <kerwinftw> @labanderox bo5 increases competitive legitimact
[1:33:15] <viceroi93> falcon doesnt have a sex kick
[1:33:16] <+tygermom> sour and sweet spots
[1:33:17] <%Skullgod> you still arent stopping them
[1:33:18] <@Menitta> works 60% of the time every time
[1:33:18] <drybowser34> Bowser has a meteor
[1:33:20] <gunstar73> melee matches end pretty fast unless its versus a floaty
[1:33:20] <SuperKirby24> sex kick Kappa
[1:33:21] <CastellanVon> @RZRtv System wise, it's an angle of like iirc 30 degrees that separates meteors from spikes
[1:33:21] <%Skullgod> you are stoping volleyball spikes
[1:33:22] <ManOfReason> Lol i get u dude
[1:33:26] <kerwinftw> @labanderox better indicator of the better player
[1:33:29] <+MisterAngryEyes112> I mean
[1:33:31] <+MisterAngryEyes112> sure
[1:33:32] <+DFDEDSDCD> This makes me want to play PM right now but I don't have a Wii or an ISO on Dolphin.
[1:33:34] <+MisterAngryEyes112> i guess
[1:33:35] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Nipple or nifl?
[1:33:36] <Sir_Walrus> I would say that maybe FGC should be Bo5 but w/e
[1:33:43] <+tygermom> so sick
[1:33:43] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:33:48] <+mandingowithplandingo> Nipple
[1:33:49] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @gunstar73 which sucks because one of the best players plays a floaty naroSmug
[1:33:51] <+MisterAngryEyes112> Three point landing!
[1:33:52] <RZRtv> @castellanvon true, you're not wrong on that
[1:33:53] <sunnythedrunk> show him bomb recovery
[1:33:54] <+DFDEDSDCD> Starts doing Metal Gear music for Samus
[1:34:05] <kerwinftw> I would say it's whack that the rest of the FGC hasnt adopted bo5
[1:34:12] <+clack14> how many fgc tournies are on time? 🤔
[1:34:14] <Sir_Walrus> Like instead of asking "why is Melee Bo5" you could just as easily ask "why is FGC Bo3"
[1:34:19] <gunstar73> hbox why you gotta be so lame nairoBink
[1:34:21] <+thewaifoo> it took me a whole month of grinding to get into it
[1:34:21] <Pnutz409> Woolie will figure it out
[1:34:27] <labanderox> i guess the obvious problem with bo5 early is that there aren't enough time in the day to accomodate a bo5 tournament
[1:34:28] <Noponiz> does ganon not know how godlike peach is?
[1:34:31] <%Skullgod> Samus is a high mid tier
[1:34:32] <Moralltach1> kirby is shit and samus is okey
[1:34:34] <Noponiz> I mean woolie,fuck
[1:34:34] <Jetsfantasy> Kirby was great in 64
[1:34:34] <%Skullgod> kirby is a bottom low tier
[1:34:35] <MettleWolf> That simultaneous laugh
[1:34:36] <+DFDEDSDCD> Someone show him High-level Captain Falcon.
[1:34:41] <+tegas_> BO5 is a terrible viewer experience.
[1:34:44] <Sir_Walrus> Melee pools are Bo3
[1:34:45] <AFoolishPaper> 2nd grade kirby Kreygasm
[1:34:49] <gunstar73> samus is mid tier
[1:34:55] <Sir_Walrus> But I believe it turns Bo5 at top 64
[1:34:55] <didgereedoodah> japan tourneys are often bo1
[1:34:56] <+tygermom> floaties disgusting
[1:34:56] <+tegas_> for finals sure.
[1:35:02] <CastellanVon> Show Woolie I Killed Mufasa
[1:35:03] <Red_Ace_Black_Jack> Wait is that Kage?
[1:35:12] <%Biggredd87> Yep
[1:35:13] <gunstar73> bo5 lets better player win
[1:35:16] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @labanderox I'm not sure how true this is, but I feel like since melee started out as a grassroots things where they only had smash games at the tourneys they had more time for Bo5s compared to other FGC tourneys
[1:35:17] <%Manofsalt> Manofsalt subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! poggers
[1:35:21] <+mandingowithplandingo> Holy shit, that is Kage lmfao
[1:35:21] <Sir_Walrus> Yeah it's slower but we got time so
[1:35:24] <+mandingowithplandingo> How have I not noticed
[1:35:29] <gunstar73> jp tourney are dumb for bo1
[1:35:35] <Noponiz> bo5 should always be used as much as the runtime makes feasible. It's just better for competition
[1:35:38] <+tygermom> PEWFAT
[1:35:38] <+tegas_> If BO5 is needed game is at fault.

[1:35:56] <didgereedoodah> if you want to do a whole tournament in 1 day bo1 is often the only way to do it
[1:35:57] <VorpalSlash> Teams is the true way to play smash
[1:36:01] <labanderox> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug melee does have a lot of seperate tournaments yeah, most fgc's had to share the same tournament while smash usually has its own tourney circuit
[1:36:05] <+DFDEDSDCD> Does he not know about WOMBO COMBO?!

[1:38:17] <+DFDEDSDCD> i want to see his reacton
[1:38:18] <Summate> I guess it depends on how you measure popularity. If you mean usage, that's straight false. Falco and Marth are the most commonly used.
[1:38:21] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @Grayhammatter he fell off the stage and hit the bottom of the screen
[1:38:22] <CastellanVon> 20XX might not even be the best team but Armada might be making Fox Peach look way better.

[1:39:35] <MettleWolf> Ganon's too HEAVY
[1:39:41] <nmaten> hold stocks for them
[1:39:53] <$cureneckbeard> !uptime
[1:39:53] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 39 minutes
[1:39:55] <sunnythedrunk> The disrespect
[1:39:57] <Tearsnboots> Eh the low tiers are still fun
[1:40:10] <+Grayhammatter> gottem
[1:40:13] <Pnutz409> nice
[1:40:16] <MettleWolf> 3v1
[1:40:24] <+mandingowithplandingo> I think “unplayable” is an overstatement
[1:40:28] <+Friendlyjuice96> low tiers are sitll viable until top 100 level tbh
[1:40:32] <+MisterAngryEyes112> Oh nooooo Sheik Fox LUL
[1:40:35] <Red_Ace_Black_Jack> LOW TIER KINGS
[1:40:38] <Nineball_Luce> Bowser iz funn
[1:40:48] <viceroi93> fox
[1:40:48] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:40:53] <+MisterAngryEyes112> Fox
[1:40:54] <+DFDEDSDCD> Who all is here with @WoolieVersus btw.
[1:40:58] <MettleWolf> He's Akuma XD
[1:40:58] <+MisterAngryEyes112> Fox is the best
[1:41:04] <NumberTooBig> Fox only, final destination
[1:41:05] <ChivalRuse> uncanny LUL
[1:41:07] <Pnutz409> lol
[1:41:07] <+wal__rus> fox is for sure the best
[1:41:11] <+DFDEDSDCD> Fox is Ken. Falco is Akuma.
[1:41:17] <ChivalRuse> what is this poltergeist LUL
[1:41:19] <TheGershon> SE tier
[1:41:27] <+DFDEDSDCD> Mario is Ryu
[1:41:27] <Twon_From_Wakanda> Broken game for a broken time
[1:41:28] <+blastazoid26> Melee noises intensify
[1:41:32] <arkv01> peach X ganon
[1:41:46] <arkv01> a romance across time
[1:41:49] <Sir_Walrus> I mean a Yoshi player is able to beat HBox so to say that only like the top 5 or 6 characters are viable is just straight wrong
[1:41:52] <NumberTooBig> is mario honest enough to be a ryu
[1:41:54] <$cureneckbeard> He fell off the cliff when I ran away from him!
[1:41:56] <ZeroSuitMusa> are you going to any major tourneys this year Kage?
[1:42:26] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @Sir_Walrus I mean if there's only one pikachu player and one yoshi player is it fair to call those characters viable?
[1:42:31] <Fixiak> @sir_walrus lol, but amsa is not human
[1:42:35] <manstertruck> these rolls
[1:42:42] <ManOfReason> @NumberTooBig i mean, tbh, mario has a cape that is really janky when it comes to edgeguarding
[1:42:42] <+mandingowithplandingo> Yes
[1:42:59] <ResidentSleeper22> LUL
[1:43:00] <+DrunkenDice> woolie playing melee PogChamp

[1:43:01] <Pnutz409> tk
[1:43:06] <MettleWolf> So twitchy
[1:43:08] <+wal__rus> viability is a gray area
[1:43:10] <+mushymoto> LUL
[1:43:19] <haisho> just throw out your moves and GET THAT JETPACK
[1:43:21] <CastellanVon> Hbox shows Jigglypuff is super viable but he's like, one of two Jiggs players in the top 100 of Melee.
[1:43:36] <Tearsnboots> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug Puff is considered top tier but there's only one good Puff player
[1:43:38] <Sir_Walrus> I mean if the characters are able to do it then yeah they're viable, even if it's a lot harder for those characters. I'd say characters aren't viable when they just not able to do the thing
[1:43:41] <SomersaultJustice> carry pls
[1:43:43] <Ryong> I just joined and half expected someone to have a hitbox and/or someone to have the FIXED PERFECT GC CONTROLLER
[1:43:44] <+MisterAngryEyes112> KAGE YOU GOT THIS
[1:43:45] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> good point
[1:43:47] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Never not be attacking
[1:43:59] <+tygermom> just 1 LUL
[1:44:07] <+MisterAngryEyes112> That's a fox upsmash LUL
[1:44:10] <+mrcooperblack> Never stop goin' in.
[1:44:20] <+DFDEDSDCD> Tier lists don't really matter in this game. Though, they still exist and are updated every now and again.
[1:44:23] <Tearsnboots> WOMBO COMBO
[1:44:24] <MettleWolf> School Yard Bully Him
[1:44:27] <NumberTooBig> @sir_walrus try playing Enkidu and you'll know what Low Tier is
[1:44:27] <Sir_Walrus> Team wobbles LUL
[1:44:41] <gunstar73> upsmash never doesn't work
[1:44:48] <+mrcooperblack> shout outs to stitch!
[1:44:49] <Sir_Walrus> Tier lists matter less in this game then everyone says they do
[1:44:50] <Jetsfantasy> More like Team BANNED :P
[1:44:52] <Noponiz> it's a downright safe flashkick but without invincibility
[1:45:03] <+ledgefiend> I agree with walrus
[1:45:03] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> something something tier lists don't matter something something roy beating any fox
[1:45:13] <BurdRightsActivist> something something tier lists don't matter something something roy beating any fox btw melee sucks
[1:45:15] <+ledgefiend> its so much more about the players than the characters
[1:45:15] <Lazyallaround> Listen to those sticks. The sweet sound of smash
[1:45:22] <PSI_Guy95> clickdy clack clickedy clack
[1:45:33] <+tygermom> pretty sure it's a melee only thing
[1:45:34] <+tygermom> its sucjs
[1:45:36] <+tygermom> sucks
[1:45:38] <bignerb> ssbm asmr
[1:45:40] <MettleWolf> Matrix dodge
[1:45:43] <Sir_Walrus> The best player in the world for a long time was a peach main
[1:45:45] <cero_5> brawl has port advantage stuff
[1:45:49] <Sir_Walrus> And it's currently a puff main
[1:45:58] <Sir_Walrus> So
[1:46:02] <VorpalSlash> Brawl port priority is some funny shit
[1:46:04] <ZeroSuitMusa> !ports
[1:46:04] <CastellanVon> Because of Port Priority, Snake is the only character in FG history to have an advantage against himself.
[1:46:04] <+thewaifoo> best thing ultimate has done was reduce landing lag
[1:46:09] <ILikeSwamperts> o shit mtl?
[1:46:18] <NumberTooBig> Tier lists are flawed becas use it only applies to sterile, 1v1 matches at the highest level usually, some characters get more or less useful as players get better
[1:46:20] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> honestly GC clicking and clacking noises are great. Legit game cube is my favorite controller just because of the noises
[1:46:40] <mtler514> bad game design
[1:46:44] <Tearsnboots> Port priority is some frame perfect shit
[1:46:47] <+TeddybearTicket> Smash is full of inconsistencies
[1:46:49] <NumberTooBig> Potemkin is scary as fuck for your first 1000 matches against one
[1:46:56] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> brawl snake is the only character in any game that has an uneven mirror MU naroSmug
[1:46:56] <ManOfReason> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug yeah, very reminiscent of arcade sticks
[1:46:59] <+DFDEDSDCD> Day 1 tier lists are the only ones that matter.
[1:47:03] <+wal__rus> port priority almost never actually comes into play to be fair
[1:47:09] <MettleWolf> I love the Smash "Clickity Clack Clack" OST, such a good track
[1:47:09] <+wal__rus> some assholes rps for it
[1:47:10] <+Alcamest> Is that Guy on a right a Giant or is everyone else just really small?
[1:47:18] <Sir_Walrus> Kage is the WARRIOR
[1:47:24] <+tygermom> if you rps for port priority play a different game
[1:47:24] <%afronooch> both
[1:47:25] <+Friendlyjuice96> kage is daddy af

[1:50:08] <CastellanVon> Bizzaro plays like a madman. Kage actually plays smart.
[1:50:22] <+Kezia0007> I killed Mufasa is siiick
[1:50:24] <twoah> His evisceration was imminent.
[1:50:35] <+ssulcer> n0ne is a good mix of flash and substance

[1:52:15] <basedfer> Slap city is legit a great game lmao
[1:52:16] <NumberTooBig> Kirby's running A is annoying
[1:52:23] <Tearsnboots> PM Kirby TehePelo
[1:52:23] <NumberTooBig> in ultimate
[1:52:24] <%Toynota10> he had some good combos in 4
[1:52:24] <+TruSpindash> Kirby is godlike in 64
[1:52:27] <+Grayhammatter> the spinning hammer is awful
[1:52:30] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> does woolie know about kirby's throws in melee
[1:52:33] <korsablade> 64 Kirby <3
[1:52:34] <menacingsleeveless> there's an enchilada in the fridge... i best leave it be
[1:52:40] <Plague_Nurse> Sekiwhat
[1:52:40] <+ssulcer> kirby isnt that bad in ult. but hes no wolf lol
[1:52:45] <VorpalSlash> Kirby is still garbo in PM lol
[1:52:47] <hntronium> Tenchu Souls!
[1:52:49] <+doragonkiba> Kirby is underrated in Ultimate, tbh. He's not good but he's WAAYY better than Little Mac, Bowser Jr, PPlant, etc.
[1:52:56] <whobeee> Persona 5 had that post launch embargo and it turned out great
[1:53:00] <+felixayada> isn't sekiro's embargo up the day before it comes out? lol
[1:53:01] <+Ace5335> bowser jr aint bad
[1:53:06] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @doragonkiba why'd you pick those 3 specific characters to list lol
[1:53:06] <PlainSimpleTailor> But POST LAUNCH tho
[1:53:07] <+felixayada> def not post launch
[1:53:12] <gunstar73> mac isnt a charchater in ultimate
[1:53:13] <nmaten> Persona 5 STILL has a post launch embargo
[1:53:14] <+AccioSkullar> yeah its for thursday at 12pm est
[1:53:20] <NumberTooBig> @whobeee but mostly because SPOILERS DansGame
[1:53:21] <%Wool> Smash Ladder is still down :(
[1:53:21] <manstertruck> Kirby f throw is non functional in ultimate
[1:53:24] <basedfer> Hey Kage how’s the kid you send child support to?
[1:53:25] <+tygermom> sekiro's embargo is tomorrow iirc
[1:53:32] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Gwin is in sekiro
[1:53:35] <+tygermom> I know lobos and some others are streaming it tomorrow
[1:53:42] <ManOfReason> online with the thuggery, lets get some fiends in here
[1:53:42] <+ssulcer> Now if scar and toph are on tonight that would be a sick crossover LUL
[1:53:48] <%TheMilhouseExperience> I’m joking I don’t know that.
[1:53:48] <SimnaibnSind> Netplay with me then @WoolieVersus ^___^
[1:53:48] <+ssulcer> rip smashladder
[1:53:49] <PlainSimpleTailor> Oh, apatCrazyhead apatMenace Well, fuck me then

[1:54:20] <+attackofthesage> What dolphin version you guys on
[1:54:22] <ResidentSleeper22> mangoFox
[1:54:24] <Plague_Nurse> no
[1:54:25] <JumboMan214> OG Reggie
[1:54:25] <+doragonkiba> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug Little mac is obvious, piranha was disappointing for dlc, bowser jr makes me sad because I want him to be good and he's close because he has some good moves but he has a really sad projectile and so few combos
[1:54:31] <PSI_Guy95> Zelda has the best move in the game
[1:54:32] <Rhinoprotoss> Where the chrome tabs at tho?
[1:54:36] <Pnutz409> 503 error :-(
[1:54:36] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> hey zelda has some good moves! Her down B is the best move in the game
[1:54:39] <+ssulcer> @Sir_Walrus that way they can finally win more than the guest lol
[1:54:43] <PlainSimpleTailor> Zelda has the BEST FOOTSIES
[1:54:45] <+attackofthesage> @WoolieVersus what version of Dolphin are you using for netplay?
[1:54:52] <+DFDEDSDCD> I would think @WoolieVersus would play Kirby or Captain Falcon in this game, not Samus. Just because of how slow she is.
[1:54:53] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:54:56] <Sir_Walrus> Oh boy
[1:55:04] <+MisterAngryEyes112> Alrighty here we go can of worms yo
[1:55:06] <+Aztec50> project SLIPPI DOLPHIN
[1:55:06] <Gutsandlove> DQ
[1:55:09] <+Grayhammatter> that should be a DQ
[1:55:09] <NumberTooBig> @doragonkiba i actually like PP since EVERY move can be adjusted
[1:55:09] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @doragonkiba haven't been keeping up with the scene lately, is little mac making a comeback at the pro level or something? I thought he was just mediocre
[1:55:11] <manstertruck> not like this
[1:55:16] <+thewaifoo> absolutely, smash or fgc thats a DQ
[1:55:18] <DatAsuna> But if the TO isn't there how do you get the TO?
[1:55:25] <%Kisabuza> you definitely don't need smash ladder to play games with the viewers. You will be using the same host code given by the emulator regardless. Just pick a viewer to play as normal and send them the code directly on twitch
[1:55:28] <+wal__rus> pause is off
[1:55:28] <gunstar73> it was dumb
[1:55:29] <+djs1312> pause was off @WoolieVersus
[1:55:30] <Psyramics> pause was off
[1:55:30] <+ssulcer> pause was turned off
[1:55:31] <Tearsnboots> DQ depends on who you are Kappa
[1:55:34] <+Pungulator> @WoolieVersus Pause was supposedly turned off
[1:55:34] <+wal__rus> you cannot pause
[1:55:37] <gunstar73> pause is off
[1:55:39] <Plague_Nurse> Guy cheated
[1:55:45] <+felixayada> pause is off, if you're on the angel platform you can get up to get a TO
[1:55:45] <gunstar73> he went to get to
[1:55:48] <manstertruck> poor wishes
[1:55:48] <Bcm101> pause was off, and he already yelled for a TO
[1:55:49] <PlainSimpleTailor> No pausing, because screw not having that rule
[1:55:50] <+wal__rus> wishes shouldve just waited
[1:55:55] <NumberTooBig> pause was off, and smash players deserve special attention
[1:55:56] <+wal__rus> but i mean the situation is fucked
[1:56:01] <gunstar73> them he wpn the tournament woolie
[1:56:02] <labanderox> isn't that the fault of the tournament then
[1:56:08] <manstertruck> wasn't wishes who left
[1:56:09] <John_Fukerbutt> skullgirls
[1:56:11] <CastellanVon> Nintendo is slow on FG stuff ofc
[1:56:13] <+cawfeeHexadice> It's in GGXRD
[1:56:15] <+Ace5335> nope
[1:56:17] <+VoidShaman> Pat mentions it on hi Twitter.
[1:56:18] <PSI_Guy95> I think waiting for the TO would've been smarter yeah
[1:56:19] <gunstar73> mars won the whole tournament
[1:56:19] <+DFDEDSDCD> Hold to pause is realtivly new standard. Which means it will be in smash in about 4 games.
[1:56:23] <+MisterAngryEyes112> Nintendo doesn't support hold to pause
[1:56:26] <%TheMilhouseExperience> In Skullgirls
[1:56:27] <+wal__rus> youre supposed to wait on the spawn platform
[1:56:29] <labanderox> they should have kept pause on
[1:56:29] <+sparkjavelin> hold to pause on skullgirls
[1:56:37] <Sir_Walrus> Hold to pause isn't in smash because Nintendo is bad at QoL
[1:56:38] <+ssulcer> @DFDEDSDCD maybe 5, dont get too hasty
[1:56:39] <+wal__rus> according to the ruleset you have to wait if they leave on the spawn platform
[1:56:41] <+doragonkiba> Pause is turned off in tournament, so stopping on platform is the accepted option. He should've informed Wishes tho, just walking off was pretty weird
[1:56:49] <PlainSimpleTailor> Have tourney players ever pissed themselves due to losing track of body functions during play?
[1:56:50] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> nintendo doesn't want to add hold to pause because they refuse to make smart, user friendly decisions
[1:56:56] <+wal__rus> he shouldve talked to wishes for sure
[1:56:56] <Arek_1> Hold to pause started in SFXTK.
[1:57:02] <+DFDEDSDCD> @ssulcer I was lowballing it for the non smash players in the chat.
[1:57:09] <pazuuuzuuuu> slap city time?
[1:57:15] <John_Fukerbutt> "coaching"
[1:57:21] <Plague_Nurse> Should have been disqualified
[1:57:22] <+velvy_cakes> Jeez, what a mess.
[1:57:23] <+thunderhog> more specifcly they were yelling out the players tendencies
[1:57:24] <+ssulcer> @DFDEDSDCD its melee night, no one here is a smash player Kappa
[1:57:25] <+doragonkiba> I'm really surprised remappable controls are in the game at all tbh with how bad Nintendo is at providing reasonable options lmao
[1:57:26] <SimnaibnSind> Slippi or 5.9?
[1:57:26] <John_Fukerbutt> dumbasses were yelling moves
[1:57:27] <+peri_d0t> just got here... ...what would pat think?
[1:57:31] <dozind16> ohhhhhh i just read thru pats twitter timeline about thissss
[1:57:37] <gunstar73> they replayed it chat dude won
[1:57:38] <Arek_1> Or was it Skullgirls?
[1:57:38] <+thunderhog> like "YO THIS DUDE ALWAYS TECHS OFF THE LEDGE"
[1:57:40] <+MisterAngryEyes112> "He's going to jump, he's going to jump again!"
[1:57:47] <+MisterAngryEyes112> Super grimy
[1:57:52] <gunstar73> he won the whole tournament
[1:57:55] <manstertruck> He didn't win the reset, wishes chose not to play
[1:58:02] <nmaten> It has happened in League and it was a huge deal
[1:58:06] <+wal__rus> the spectator should be banned from events
[1:58:07] <gunstar73> wishes did play
[1:58:08] <John_Fukerbutt> tekken players are laughing in the distance
[1:58:13] <DatAsuna> Note, the guy who lost actualy had more of a chance on the reset because less damage
[1:58:13] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> they should have kicked out the audience members tho
[1:58:15] <gunstar73> he lost pretty hard
[1:58:16] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> *then
[1:58:16] <%TheMilhouseExperience> THE CROWD WAS STARING AT THE SCREEN.! I CANNOT PLAY LIKE THIS!
[1:58:16] <cosmictrashcan> @mandingowithplandingo they replayed last game with 2 stocks
[1:58:23] <+doragonkiba> @manstertruck Wishes said he wasn't going to play, but decided to go along with it. The match was set to where it was before with stocks and %
[1:58:25] <ManOfReason> ruff rowdy boys
[1:58:26] <PSI_Guy95> Wasn't there a MOBA where a player won because they saw the screen on a reflection and it gave away a play?
[1:58:42] <@Solidus_113> thuggery cannot be stopped
[1:58:47] <bevyrage> @PSI_Guy95 yeah that was league
[1:58:53] <+wal__rus> the spectator was the one at fault, it wasnt even heckling it was just literally advice from the crowd
[1:58:55] <dozind16> Woolie show your feetsies
[1:58:57] <manstertruck> @doragonkiba Christ. that's some shit.
[1:58:57] <+tygermom> PokChop LUL
[1:59:00] <+Grayhammatter> nonstop infinite thuggery
[1:59:03] <+thunderhog> SourPls
[1:59:04] <PSI_Guy95> @bevyrage wew thought so, I remembered it being Dota for some reason
[1:59:07] <eluded_> LUL
[1:59:09] <+Aztec50> But if someone is playing so that people in the crowd knows what they are gonna do, why wouldnt the other player notice?
[1:59:11] <+TruSpindash> SourPls
[1:59:11] <ManOfReason> "SOMEBODY"S GETTING FUCKED"
[1:59:12] <+mushymoto> LUL
[1:59:13] <gunstar73> Spector was banned from tournament
[1:59:19] <+tygermom> again those guys are just thick skinned
[1:59:21] <+tygermom> and its sick
[1:59:21] <neckslap> cmonBruh
[1:59:23] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> there's a difference between yelling your brains out for hype shit and shouting advice to the players
[1:59:26] <eluded_> CORE VALUES
[1:59:26] <+MisterAngryEyes112> Thuggery LUL
[1:59:27] <KishinGrek> Just got a 2 sec ad of nothing that supports woolie
[1:59:29] <+Grayhammatter> core thuggery
[1:59:31] <SGrim> Core Values: Thuggery rooPog
[1:59:32] <MaSterChiEfin420blntNinjA> D: D:
[1:59:36] <PlainSimpleTailor> The BEST core values
[1:59:39] <%Dr00_PhD> Anyone who's never heard that song go look up Monday Mitten Mashers
[1:59:40] <cosmictrashcan> The problem wasn't really he crowd being loud, it was mostly the "coaching" part
[1:59:42] <+doragonkiba> @manstertruck yeah, i feel for Wishes
[1:59:49] <gunstar73> difference between shit talk and advice
[1:59:53] <+Ace5335> IT was his friend i think
[1:59:55] <Sir_Walrus> @Aztec50 people observing and not needing to think about playing can pick up on things that people who are too focused on playing cannot
[1:59:56] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 2 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 8oz (240mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[2:00:03] <NumberTooBig> back seat gaming's the best
[2:00:03] <John_Fukerbutt> the fact it wasnt a dq is whats insane
[2:00:05] <+Grayhammatter> LUL

[2:00:16] <+MisterAngryEyes112> JEEEZ
[2:00:17] <+Aztec50> good point
[2:00:24] <+tygermom> +2 on block you're good dog
[2:00:24] <gunstar73> it was his friend
[2:00:24] <+DrunkenDice> That's legit sick LUL
[2:00:28] <nmaten> IIRC it wasnt the crowd, it was the other guy's friend
[2:00:57] <gunstar73> i know all these guys would be salty too
[2:00:59] <Boomcannon> headphones would go a long way in this smash situation
[2:00:59] <basedfer> @nmaten that changes things
[2:01:06] <manstertruck> just go yell "he's gonna jump" whenever your pal is losing so they replay
[2:01:10] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> make the players turn on airplane mode naroSmug
[2:01:16] <mtpater> when is slap
[2:01:25] <gunstar73> coaching Is already banned in smash
[2:01:26] <nmaten> Its a lot more of a complicated situation than people are making it out to be
[2:01:27] <@Menitta> Bowling has coaches!
[2:01:28] <+MisterAngryEyes112> Underdog
[2:01:36] <%Skullgod> if they allow airplane mode how will none bitch about wobbling on twitter while being wobbled
[2:01:47] <nmaten> the guy who was getting coached said he didn't illicit it
[2:01:49] <VorpalSlash> Headphones for setups is godlike, wish it was more common
[2:01:54] <Sir_Walrus> Personally I don't think it should've been a replay, but it definitely should not have been a DQ
[2:01:54] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[2:01:55] <@Menitta> "Yknow what this time Timmy? I want you to get your opponent's health to Zero."
[2:01:57] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @Skullgod LOL
[2:01:58] <labanderox> its always up to the player either way
[2:01:59] <ManOfReason> exactly
[2:02:01] <+thunderhog> I think the problem is specifcly the live coaching and not the between round coaching
[2:02:03] <moogleboy1984> Compare Marss with the SonicFox "side swap" call
[2:02:06] <mtpater> S L A P
[2:02:10] <+tygermom> thats just life
[2:02:11] <%Skullgod> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug bang bang
[2:02:12] <+MarkOfRambo> S L A P
[2:02:12] <+JustGinja> This is literally the plot to an episode of yugioh
[2:02:16] <+DrunkenDice> need welfare for the FGC
[2:02:17] <+tygermom> sometime shit aint fair
[2:02:17] <+Grayhammatter> S L A P
[2:02:18] <MelBrooksKA> Is this how this show usually is, I wasn't expecting this much talking when I came in
[2:02:18] <+mrcooperblack> it's harder to struggle with money
[2:02:19] <Zooxf> play 2 win
[2:02:21] <+tygermom> gotta deal with it
[2:02:23] <Sir_Walrus> It should've been like an "alright, continue playing, whoever did that should be kicked out"
[2:02:24] <+DFDEDSDCD> Remember when that Smash Ultimate player found out Ryu and Ken can Wake-up DP and called it some dumb Smash name like a woopadoop or some shit.
[2:02:28] <TheFilth> I love how passionate these guys get talking about this stuff
[2:02:31] <thisnameisnotcreative> S L A P
[2:02:33] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Why are they fighting the RNG against a real person.
[2:02:35] <+MisterAngryEyes112> So its just like real life :)
[2:02:37] <+thunderhog> Live coaching just causes problems as it inadvertantly causes mental infulences on the players, weather they follow it or not
[2:02:40] <+ssulcer> You can't always get what you want, but if you try sometimes, you just might find, you get what you need
[2:02:41] <+mrcooperblack> Excuse me its harder to struggle when you have pillows full of cash
[2:02:41] <PSI_Guy95> Don't worry Melee will ban nanomachine-aided players. But they won't ban broken controllers
[2:02:44] <labanderox> this happens in other esports as well, like League Dota and the like
[2:02:47] <NumberTooBig> ends justify the means, which is why melee players get a broke ass, uncommon controller
[2:02:48] <manstertruck> the mamamia @dfdedsdcd
[2:02:51] <sunnythedrunk> Coaching is whack in a copletely mental sport
[2:02:52] <VJdarkworld> @JustGinja "screw the rules, i have money" - yugioh abridged
[2:02:53] <CastellanVon> @DFDEDSDCD iirc that was a joke that got taken as real
[2:02:54] <Boomcannon> the mama mia? The "shoryuken tech"
[2:02:55] <+thunderhog> especially if both players can hear it, cause now it just fucks with both players
[2:03:03] <gunstar73> thata what moba coaches do
[2:03:12] <ZeroSuitMusa> shoutout to Hbox against Sfat
[2:03:14] <ZeroSuitMusa> lol
[2:03:23] <pazuuuzuuuu> imagine an mma fight where the fighter listens to the audience like proce is right
[2:03:26] <+ssulcer> @ZeroSuitMusa lol you see that vid Hbox is a person?
[2:03:26] <PlainSimpleTailor> OMG what if we made a Boxing Coach simulator game. Multiplayer where you all give competing advice to the fighter and then watch the bout
[2:03:29] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @DatAsuna
[2:03:36] <+thunderhog> like if two people are playing RPS, and some dude yells out YO THIS DUDE GONNA GO PAPER, that causes a whole nother mind game weather or not to take the advice or not
[2:03:40] <ZeroSuitMusa> dude yes that was hilarious
[2:03:42] <NumberTooBig> @plainsimpletailor Punch Club?
[2:03:43] <+Ace5335> I think for team games is fine but for fighting games is kinda meh
[2:03:46] <+ssulcer> right lol
[2:03:55] <CastellanVon> I remember Zero vs MKLeo where ZeRo had like 20 people crowding him around after each match and MKLeo had no one and MKLeo still won.
[2:03:58] <+ssulcer> Toph at the end fukin kills me every time
[2:03:58] <PlainSimpleTailor> @NumberTooBig ...oh.
[2:03:59] <Sir_Walrus> Crowd Coaching is a weird fuckin thing that I never thought would exist
[2:04:05] <arkv01> I think SANCTIONED coaching is fine, not yelling from the fucking crowds
[2:04:07] <moogleboy1984> if you're going to ban coachin from the crowd, you need to have the players isolated from the crowd
[2:04:19] <PSI_Guy95> Ma'am, I'm Connor. I'm a cyborg from CyberLife. I'm here to help your son play Super Smash Bros Melee
[2:04:25] <arkv01> yeah put them in the soundproof boxes

[2:04:44] <cosmictrashcan> you know every match marss plays from now on people are gonna yell "hes gonna jump" LUL
[2:04:47] <Boomcannon> Core-A's video on coaching is great on this topic
[2:04:49] <%TheMilhouseExperience> You have to fight your opponent IN HIS LIVING ROOM.
[2:05:02] <+ssulcer> CoreA has nothing but great videos
[2:05:02] <hijokaidan> melee azaxePog
[2:05:03] <gunstar73> its already a meme he's gonna jump

[2:05:16] <cosmictrashcan> NETPLAY????
[2:05:24] <PSI_Guy95> "he's gonna jump" just makes me think someone's constantly about to commit suicide
[2:05:28] <PSI_Guy95> i don't like it no sir
[2:05:38] <spardanwarrior> So would 50/50 just be ripping out some buttons from your opponents fightstick?

[2:36:49] <nmaten> yooo watch that shit wools
[2:36:51] <TheGershon> Isn't it fucking awesome how we have netplay for this game
[2:36:54] <%s_xylocalsingles> @WoolieVersus The term was coined by smasher Matt Deezie as a sexual innuendo referring to the properties of the attack in the original Super Smash Bros.
[2:37:22] <MelBrooksKA> Maybe it comes from the burlesque dance kick
[2:37:22] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:37:47] <+MisterAngryEyes112> DAT's not safe
[2:37:47] <%s_xylocalsingles> A visual sex kick consists of the thrust (kicking motion) and the extension (leg remaining out), with the other leg bent and the foot tucked beneath the kicking leg's thigh
[2:37:53] <%s_xylocalsingles> Properties of sex kicks include: A single hit. Predominantly sideways knockback. A long hitbox duration, with lower damage and knockback after its first few frames. Fast startup and low landing lag. Similar animation and hitbox placement throughout entire attack.
[2:37:54] <VorpalSlash> Documentary came out after EVO @WoolieVersus
[2:37:55] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Alright I’m out. Everyone have a good week.
[2:37:57] <Sir_Walrus> We need the next smash documentary to revive Melee again

[2:41:36] <%CaptainPileDriver> okay no, thank god
[2:41:39] <+attackofthesage> lol my b
[2:41:40] <CastellanVon> Popular Smashers like Mang0 and Mew2King get swarmed in events. They got tons of fans. I don't know of an FGC player that's that popular.
[2:41:50] <manstertruck> daigo
[2:41:59] <+Shotgundam009> Imagine if Chris G accepted and lost to the ghost of mahvel
[2:42:04] <Zicorth> Oh damn, I didn't know this was Woolie's channel.
[2:42:09] <BlacSoul> SonicFox?
[2:42:22] <CD_Vorporal> hold yx start
[2:42:25] <ManOfReason> maybe mike ross pre-exodus
[2:42:29] <CalderGaming> the decay of melee continues

[2:42:50] <+Shotgundam009> lol
[2:42:52] <CastellanVon> I saw Mang0 signing autographs with a line as long as the venue. I don't know if SonicFox has that but that's what I mean as popular.
[2:42:54] <VorpalSlash> There are many
[2:42:55] <SilverInferno3> MONOPOLY

[2:43:04] <KumaTiger> melee has its cult following tho CoolStoryBob
[2:43:20] <Zicorth> Melee had over 153,000 viewers during Genesis 6 Grand Finals.
[2:43:35] <Zicorth> Ultimate had ~132,000 briefly ,then dropped to ~123,000.
[2:43:45] <+Kuro_Koshka> Ultimate was near midnight
[2:43:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> you sent that tweet out last evo and i saw you in pools and just waited always
[2:43:48] <Zicorth> EVO didn't drop Melee because of viewership reasons.
[2:43:51] <+Kuro_Koshka> People gotta sleep
[2:44:00] <CastellanVon> Didn't Genesis 6 go super late? Those numbers could have been ever higher. Smash is mad pop
[2:44:04] <Aya_namiko> the ping spiking
[2:44:06] <Zicorth> Ultimately EVO is a business, and companies pay EVO to get their games in.
[2:44:18] <sunnythedrunk> Might need to change the buffer
[2:44:36] <Worldbrand> oh god
[2:44:36] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:44:38] <+Shotgundam009> woof
[2:44:44] <@Menitta> Oh this is floaty. Get better internet, Wool!
[2:44:51] <Zicorth> This ping...
[2:44:52] <arkv01> wait what? 'accosted?' like as in "hey man lets SMASH'
[2:44:53] <+attackofthesage> @Zicorth Samsho I can believe but you're not telling me UNIST got in with french bread money
[2:45:12] <@Menitta> I'm very excited for Google Stadia(TM)
[2:45:14] <+Shotgundam009> ^
[2:45:16] <Datwiseguy> hehe french bread money
[2:45:22] <%linkwolf4> @Zicorth SOME companies pay. important distinction. UNIST doesn't have the money for that
[2:45:23] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Probably talking at the urinal. Don't do that
[2:45:25] <nmaten> people act like unist is the only game that got in over melee
[2:45:27] <Boomcannon> that bathroom money was saved for the main stage
[2:45:31] <Zicorth> Netplay can can basically offline CRT level for input lag, with a good enough setup.
[2:45:34] <+TruSpindash> French Bread money LUL
[2:45:40] <+Tennochief> night guys
[2:45:44] <MettleWolf> Max is live?!
[2:45:44] <CastellanVon> tbh, Melee might not even be bringing in much money with how much it costs to host Melee nowadays.
[2:45:46] <JumboMan214> @Menitta Ace Attorney on Stadia
[2:45:47] <nmaten> but bbtag is kinda dead rn and samsho isnt even out
[2:45:56] <Zicorth> Yeah, I'm not saying UNIST has a ton of money.
[2:46:00] <Manwad> Why does the gameplay seem sorta slowed down?
[2:46:01] <fabnanman> they bribed mr wiz with the finest french toast
[2:46:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus so, next evo, are you gonna bring a sign that says core values
[2:46:10] <@Menitta> @JumboMan214 See thats fine because its a visual novel. HOWEVER the mobile version of the trilogy sucks ass
[2:46:13] <straight_up_garbage> LUL
[2:46:14] <Worldbrand> that's good
[2:46:16] <+MisterAngryEyes112> That's fantastic
[2:46:17] <PSI_Guy95> Mr. Wizard graciously accepted 5 dollars and some pocket lint to accept UNIST and SamSho over Melee
[2:46:19] <+attackofthesage> @Manwad it's lagging
[2:46:23] <PSI_Guy95> He just loves fighting games (And hates Melee) that much
[2:46:24] <Manwad> Got cha
[2:46:25] <%NotTooLoudPls> free money
[2:46:29] <arkv01> NEW MERCH
[2:46:29] <TheGershon> Wrapped around like a saiyan tail
[2:46:38] <tacostarvedbeast> woolie needs to get his royalties
[2:46:43] <%Toynota10> WOOLIE MAKE THAT A SHIRT
[2:46:53] <Zicorth> Mr. Wiz wanted an excuse to have only 1 Smash game.
[2:46:57] <Zicorth> And he banked on Ultimate.
[2:47:03] <Sphincter_Spelunker> I wonder if someone is going to be allowed to sign up with the name Core Values. Or some variation
[2:47:21] <Datwiseguy> CSB | Kage sounds nice
[2:47:26] <KumaTiger> im still enjoying the schadenfreude of Melee fans still taking the news of Evo not doing Melee this year as a personal attack CoolStoryBob
[2:47:28] <Aya_namiko> @Zicorth businesses can have motivations other then money. If EVO purely cared about making money, they would have been adding games outside of the genre like apex legends fornite or LoL
[2:47:28] <Smoofmaster> Ultimate is going to break records
[2:47:29] <%Wool> sorry, Texas ping is bad and laggy :(
[2:47:37] <Zicorth> A lot of Melee players are also fine or like Ultimate too, so that's another possible reason.
[2:47:37] <@Menitta> LUL
[2:47:49] <%Wool> pls stop making me sound desperate for Woolie
[2:47:50] <+AccioSkullar> texas is way too far for netplay
[2:48:02] <Smoofmaster> im still enjoying fgc morons trying to put words in our mouths acting like we're so distraught LUL

[2:48:21] <tacostarvedbeast> its important to have a dream

[2:48:29] <SomersaultJustice> I can't believe we're seeing Wool's dream fulfilled LIVE ON STREAM
[2:48:30] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Smash players admitting they're not part of the FGC 🤔

[2:48:51] <PSI_Guy95> Wool vs Woolie, battle for the kingdom of maddentown
[2:48:53] <tacostarvedbeast> wool vs woolie battle for teh swamp
[2:49:27] <stropbopadopolis> wool has thin dreads
[2:49:32] <Aya_namiko> EVO wants to be making sure, but their motivation outside of making money is promote fighting games to a larger audience, which is why something like Unist got added.
[2:49:32] <Zicorth> Woolie, what are your thoughts on the unreleased Shrek re-make that is going to happen?
[2:49:40] <Aya_namiko> *making money
[2:49:42] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus the baki manga has a man who can squeeze coal into diamonds.
[2:49:47] <JumboMan214> @Menitta if Wool loses you gotta make a discord announcement about it and @everyone
[2:49:56] <%DeaconBluesClues> honestly woolie would be more of a red/green splash
[2:49:57] <@Menitta> ....no
[2:50:01] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus and this isn't even talking about the man who had fist fights with dinosaurs and won
[2:50:02] <+AccioSkullar> lets fucking go woolz
[2:50:15] <arkv01> ok its time for operation wrong frame data
[2:50:15] <JumboMan214> But its thuggery night
[2:50:37] <arkv01> its gentlemen's only melee night tonight
[2:50:42] <Zicorth> I mean, I fist fight dinosaurs are win all the time, so I don't see what's so odd about that. @CaptainPileDriver
[2:50:44] <@Menitta> Drop combos, backdash, and then SPD
[2:50:46] <+MisterAngryEyes112> Yo Woolie you gotta stop U Bing
[2:50:47] <+MoraMiarty> reminder that slapfighting is a viable martial art in baki

[2:51:12] <PSI_Guy95> Super wave dash on him!
[2:51:14] <MelBrooksKA> Don't touch your nose Woolie
[2:51:20] <Zicorth> Edges in Melee can be scary.
[2:51:25] <arkv01> if you fall over the edge, the edge falls over you
[2:51:26] <tacostarvedbeast> EDGE
[2:51:32] <Zicorth> In Ultimate, everyone has such crazy recoveries.
[2:51:45] <Zicorth> And ledge trumping makes getting back VASTLY easier.
[2:51:46] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:52:00] <Smoofmaster> everyone is also floatier and the ledge is more forgiving in allowing you to grab it
[2:52:05] <%Ninestempest> ultimate feels like nothing after brawl and 4
[2:52:06] <Zicorth> Yup.
[2:52:06] <+ForgeTacular14> edges are terrifying when you get to ledgedashing
[2:52:09] <PSI_Guy95> Just thinking about Ultimate makes me angry at the buffering
[2:52:21] <Zicorth> The input lag is sad in Ultimate.
[2:52:21] <amavii> ultimate is just smash 4
[2:52:30] <RabbitOTM> ultimate is great :)
[2:52:30] <Zicorth> And so is the buffer system. NotLikeThis
[2:52:35] <Worldbrand> clench
[2:52:42] <Zicorth> And Ultimate's online is BAD.
[2:52:43] <Zicorth> :(
[2:52:54] <Zicorth> Netplay is SO much better than what Nintendo has.
[2:52:54] <PlayWithTheJ> At least air dodge in Ultimate doesn't leave you in freefall.
[2:52:55] <KumaTiger> Ultimate is to Smash4 as ThirdStrike is to 2nd Impact
[2:53:01] <PSI_Guy95> ARMS online has this party lobby system where you alternate minigames with matches with a host of other people
[2:53:11] <+ForgeTacular14> ultimate's online is FINE as long as you do lobbies, not matchmaking
[2:53:12] <PSI_Guy95> Why Smash doesn't do the same is beyond me
[2:53:25] <%Ninestempest> yeah arenas are fine honestly
[2:53:26] <Smoofmaster> ^ thats bait
[2:53:46] <RabbitOTM> moon2WUT
[2:53:48] <stropbopadopolis> id still play arms if it werent dead fun online minmin for life

[2:53:53] <%deadredeyez> big come back?
[2:53:55] <%Ninestempest> 1v1 lobbies are acceptable. more than 4 people and it's fucking pain
[2:54:01] <PSI_Guy95> Oh god I just realized I had a dream last night Master Mummy was in Smash
[2:54:06] <straight_up_garbage> daaayum

[2:58:12] <JumboMan214> Maybe but Ultimate has parries
[2:58:13] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Smoofmaster
[2:58:20] <%DonatelloJose> I love how small the roster looks woolieGASM
[2:58:21] <Zicorth> @JumboMan214 So?
[2:58:32] <Zicorth> Parries aren't even good for dealing with projectiles.
[2:58:32] <Crows_feet> lffnMelee lffnMelee
[2:58:34] <~WoolieVersus> cafd160a
[2:58:41] <Zicorth> And Ultimate is FULL of strong projectiles.
[2:58:44] <JumboMan214> Parries are actually cool
[2:58:48] <%NotTooLoudPls> parries are cool tho
[2:58:48] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[2:58:48] <Zicorth> Projectiles are a bit too good in that game.
[2:58:50] <stropbopadopolis> they nerfed everything after melee
[2:58:56] <poppy_marth> 2 framing is so lame
[2:59:01] <Zicorth> Powershielding in Melee though.
[2:59:04] <+ATentacleMonster> Pog
[2:59:12] <%sirisvirus> sirisvirus subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[2:59:12] <TheHeroAppears> ask kage if he would wear the exp shirt
[2:59:12] <Zicorth> Reflecting projectiles back is very useful.
[2:59:14] <JumboMan214> Parries are cool
[2:59:14] <%DonatelloJose> No fun allowed
[2:59:17] <%ofloofy> VORP
[2:59:18] <VorpalSlash> That's not me
[2:59:18] <basedfer> 2 framing is lame, bring back ledgehods
[2:59:21] <Smoofmaster> tell him about platform mechanics, tell him about SDI walltechs, tell him about amsah techs, tell him about powershields
[2:59:22] <SilverInferno3> CONFIRMED LEGAL
[2:59:26] <VorpalSlash> I'm no wobbler
[2:59:27] <poppy_marth> wobbling in friendlies is so ugh
[2:59:28] <stropbopadopolis> wobbles all night
[2:59:29] <Rice312> Powershielding is way more impressive than parrying
[2:59:32] <%NotTooLoudPls> vorp of the Boreal valley
[2:59:33] <ManOfReason> oh no, whats a wobble
[2:59:38] <mercado94> im scared

[2:59:51] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 3 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 12oz (360mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[2:59:51] <AFoolishPaper> WOBBLE THE SCREEN
[2:59:53] <%afronooch> !uptime
[2:59:53] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 59 minutes
[2:59:54] <Smoofmaster> wobble is an infinite off of grab
[2:59:57] <%ofloofy> Wobble is when you dont want your opponent ot play the game LUL
[2:59:58] <stropbopadopolis> infinate grab w nana desync
[3:00:01] <@Menitta> this is getting out of hand
[3:00:01] <%ofloofy> to*
[3:00:03] <+doragonkiba> Wobbling without funny wobble cams Kreygasm Wobbling when the tournament cam switches to a 1-button 200bpm guitar hero track PogChamp

[3:00:36] <Smoofmaster> wobbling is inescapable, theres nothing you can do.
[3:00:37] <stropbopadopolis> mew2king crying over getting wobbled OmegaLul
[3:00:38] <poppy_marth> wobbling is waaaaay worse than any chain grab in this game
[3:00:39] <+attackofthesage> you die*
[3:00:42] <+attackofthesage> not guy lol
[3:00:57] <Datwiseguy> lets have this person do freeze glitch
[3:01:04] <extradopeness> That MEME
[3:01:05] <sunnythedrunk> It got unbanned because Mr. Wizard allowed it at evo
[3:01:10] <mercado94> wat
[3:01:11] <+doragonkiba> it used to be banned for a while, but then it got unbanned for several years, and then it got rebanned
[3:01:13] <poppy_marth> thats not it
[3:01:14] <lejeune> reggie's accent is beautiful
[3:01:19] <Aya_namiko> it was banned pretty fast until but then it was brought back because of EVO
[3:01:20] <%ofloofy> The joke went to long it BECAME BANNED for real xD rofl
[3:01:26] <poppy_marth> infinites are bad in general
[3:01:35] <%jinking79> that what happens when kids cry wolf
[3:01:36] <stropbopadopolis> pls wobble woolie once vorp he has to experience it
[3:01:38] <poppy_marth> the execution is tapping the a button
[3:01:40] <Smoofmaster> yeah wobbling is brainless
[3:01:40] <@Solidus_113> ban resets in skullgirls
[3:01:40] <Aya_namiko> EVO made the rules and said infinite were allowed in other games
[3:01:43] <$Zicorth> cheer100 There's a really good, simple practice tool for Melee called "UnclePunch's Training Mode", it's free and it makes learning a lot of mechanics very easy. https://smashboards.com/threads/training-mode-v1-1-updated-1-11-19.456449/
[3:01:43] <CastellanVon> @WoolieVersus Wobbling was unbanned because Mr.Wizard made it legal in EVO.
[3:01:44] <%NotTooLoudPls> true
[3:01:53] <Zicorth> If you're interested, of course.
[3:02:11] <PlainSimpleTailor> Clip that into a remix
[3:02:12] <%NotTooLoudPls> I liked rsf a lot
[3:02:23] <Boomcannon> this talk of wobbling reminds me of roll canceling
[3:02:28] <ernie_turbo32> Is it true Super best friends broke up because of Smash Ultimate
[3:02:32] <VorpalSlash> Damn now I wanna play SF4
[3:02:36] <CaliforniaPotatoPowers> most of this shit shouldn't be in the game though
[3:02:38] <+attackofthesage> People tweet and stuff while getting wobbled
[3:02:44] <%afronooch> nah, cause of emlo
[3:02:53] <%NotTooLoudPls> usf4 died too young
[3:02:56] <%linkwolf4> yo you WANNA LEARN A FUCKIN INFINITE?
[3:03:01] <stropbopadopolis> wobbling is the ONE lame thing in melee
[3:03:03] <PlainSimpleTailor> How has Nintendo of Japan not tried to nuke this stream yet?
[3:03:03] <%DonatelloJose> Nah, it’s like playing a combo deck in mtg
[3:03:09] <%NotTooLoudPls> that infinite video is 10/10
[3:03:11] <Zicorth> Honestly, does it matter if something was intentional or not, if it makes a game better?
[3:03:26] <+doragonkiba> somebody made a tweet saying you should only be able to wobble if you can solve a rubik's cube while doing it, and somebody actually did it in a match
[3:03:27] <poppy_marth> wobbling has legit stunted ice climbers players trying new shit and improving at the game
[3:03:29] <Smoofmaster> is usf4 is better than sfv, just play that
[3:04:03] <poppy_marth> other than fly amanita but he quit :/
[3:04:06] <+AccioSkullar> ye u guys read that already
[3:04:09] <CaliforniaPotatoPowers> @Zicorth it matters when you have to stretch so hard to make the game competitively legitimate
[3:04:44] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> Double knee
[3:04:47] <stropbopadopolis> not really a stretch just crazy skill floor
[3:04:49] <TheBrunoZone> It only matters to game devs and their intentional mechanics, hence why Brawl was so polarizing in the end, being the game that was not intended as the final product
[3:04:50] <%NotTooLoudPls> who's the worst character in melee?
[3:04:51] <PSI_Guy95> only going by developer intention would make video games really really boring
[3:04:59] <PSI_Guy95> rocketjumps and combos were not intended by developers
[3:05:05] <+AccioSkullar> @NotTooLoudPls kirby
[3:05:12] <Zicorth> Kirby or Zelda.
[3:05:14] <stropbopadopolis> kirby is the worst
[3:05:15] <Datwiseguy> ahh milliablocler
[3:05:18] <lejeune> would have made games boring
[3:05:19] <PSI_Guy95> you might as well ban kids from playing with the boxes that their presents come with too
[3:05:19] <Zicorth> Not sure who is worse, honestly.
[3:05:21] <+zagnes_raf> yo who's playing
[3:05:24] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @NotTooLoudPls Pichu
[3:05:27] <dr4g0nb0rn0> @woolieversus can you guys try to do the black hole glitch?
[3:05:27] <%NotTooLoudPls> ah see
[3:05:32] <Zicorth> Pichu is NOT the worst, lol.
[3:05:33] <%NotTooLoudPls> *I see
[3:05:44] <%Wool> Black Hole glitch is gonna crash the game lmao
[3:05:45] <Zicorth> He has some really good stuff, but also massive flaws.
[3:05:47] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @Zicorth Im joking cause I HATE Pichu
[3:05:50] <TheBrunoZone> Kirby, at least Zelda can do stuff
[3:05:50] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:05:50] <%linkwolf4> ah, good ol' milia oki
[3:05:54] <lejeune> some games should be designed to be broken and some should not
[3:05:54] <%NotTooLoudPls> has Kirby ever won a major or anything big?
[3:06:01] <+Aztec50> When's SLAP
[3:06:03] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Raichu all the way
[3:06:04] <%Skullgod> in 64 only
[3:06:05] <%afronooch> the black hole glitch was pretty much all i did as a kid
[3:06:06] <%NotTooLoudPls> no crazy good Kirby specialists?
[3:06:14] <Zicorth> Triple R was quite good.
[3:06:14] <Aya_namiko> The only problem with banning wobbling is that rulesets generally don't specify things. How many times am I allowed to have Nana hit someone who I have grabbed until it is considered a wobble?
[3:06:24] <Smoofmaster> triple R is the best kirby player, if anyone has won something with him, itd be him
[3:06:28] <+doragonkiba> In 64 Kirby is the 2nd best character, the character is rough in melee tho
[3:06:30] <poppy_marth> is that kage?\
[3:06:41] <Zicorth> Sakurai purposely nerfed Kirby in Melee.
[3:06:43] <extradopeness> Y
[3:06:44] <Zicorth> But he went too far. :(
[3:06:46] <poppy_marth> it looks like him
[3:06:48] <Zicorth> @TheBrunoZone What can Zelda do?
[3:06:52] <%NotTooLoudPls> poor Kirby
[3:06:53] <%afronooch> it is kage
[3:06:54] <ManOfReason> LOL
[3:06:58] <beatie_g> Smesh
[3:06:58] <Zicorth> Zelda has fair and bair, and kind of down smash.
[3:07:00] <JoveGar> its jump startup wtf
[3:07:01] <mercado94> LUL
[3:07:01] <Smoofmaster> kirby has a 3 frame jumpsquat, idk what youre talking about
[3:07:02] <pazuuuzuuuu> squat frames!
[3:07:05] <reiju_22> @poppy_marth it is LUL
[3:07:06] <%Ninestempest> lmaoooooo
[3:07:07] <Zicorth> She is the most gimmicky character in this game.
[3:07:10] <labanderox> pre jumpies
[3:07:15] <%DonatelloJose> @aya_namiko the moment anyone starts having fun, that is a banable offense.
[3:07:17] <+AccioSkullar> thats whats shown in debug mode tho I think
[3:07:19] <+TopTieramisu> squatties
[3:07:23] <@Solidus_113> wake up DP is called a Mamma Mia
[3:07:25] <awesomeguyrequiem> oh shit, here comes ryu with the MAMA MIAS
[3:07:26] <lejeune> the reason why kirby hasn't performed well in melee is because most players aren't worthy to wield his mighty powers
[3:07:37] <poppy_marth> KICK HIS ASS KAGE
[3:07:37] <+AccioSkullar> MAMMA MIA mangoKrey
[3:07:38] <hntronium> DMC Final already there tho?

[3:10:48] <+Byurr> tfw a couple of swedes made a game with better netplay than Nintendo LUL
[3:10:52] <Zicorth> If you're talking about a fighting game using PLATFORMS, Melee is probably the best thing there is competitively.
[3:11:02] <Zicorth> For a 2D platformer.

[3:11:12] <+MarkOfRambo> Slap City netcode is godlike.
[3:11:13] <Zicorth> Ultimate's platform movement is garbage.
[3:11:17] <Zicorth> In comparison.
[3:11:20] <+MisterAngryEyes112> Jigglypuff is simultaneously the best and worst character in the game LUL
[3:11:21] <poppy_marth> top 2 or top 3 for sure
[3:11:23] <%Ninestempest> @woolieversus ever gonna try rivals?

[3:11:54] <poppy_marth> lol too drunk, than kirby
[3:12:04] <+felixayada> oh the fps WutFace
[3:12:14] <Zicorth> I can't think of a fighting game that has more movement options/freedom of movement than Melee.
[3:12:18] <%Wool> Us Texas players are laggy

[3:13:05] <TheBrunoZone> That's like saying Kirby is top 100 because Mang0 uses him "sometimes". Emphazis in "Sometimes"
[3:13:05] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:13:06] <Zicorth> I still find it hilarious, how Melee's Netplay is actually SO much better than Ultimate's online.
[3:13:06] <+DoctorDerp388> wavedash woolie
[3:13:10] <Smoofmaster> melee is about movement, but other games have chracters with more moves, melee characters only have like 20
[3:13:17] <+AccioSkullar> ultimates online is SO bad dude
[3:13:23] <%Wool> Skullgod and I live 15 minutes away from each other
[3:13:24] <sunnythedrunk> Tell Woolie to stop Up b-ing as an aerial

[3:13:42] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Anybody know the Samus/ CaptFalcon matchup? I don't think I've seen it
[3:13:46] <%ofloofy> @Zicorth Nintendos so behind on their online services
[3:13:48] <CD_Vorporal> I host MSU's Weekly Melee On my stream lol It was fun playing neplay here

[3:13:55] <stropbopadopolis> nintendo handheld online... it was bound to suck
[3:14:13] <sunnythedrunk> Damn reggie is an OG
[3:14:16] <Zicorth> @Smoofmaster Yeah, but you can more with Melee's ~20 moves per character than almost every fighting game ever, lol.
[3:14:25] <%Toynota10> @woolieversus do you guys miss Sheik's chain?
[3:14:36] <Smoofmaster> i mean, im a melee player. You're preaching to the choir here
[3:14:37] <Zicorth> DI, Smash DI, crouch Cancelling, shield tilting, controlling your shield size, etc. etc.
[3:14:38] <%NotTooLoudPls> LUL
[3:14:39] <+doragonkiba> the only hope for good ultimate online is emulator netplay lmao. that's how little faith we have in nintendo
[3:14:58] <poppy_marth> sheik might have gone down the tier list but no match up is unwinnable
[3:15:02] <Zicorth> Emulating Ultimate will take far more resources than Melee, lol.
[3:15:05] <lejeune> nintendo is just in this bizarro world where they make games and systems that are years ahead in concept but end up having a few horrible things in them
[3:15:11] <Nina96> damn woolie
[3:15:12] <Zicorth> It will be WAYYYY more demanding.
[3:15:17] <+pkmamsters> LUL 3 up-b in a row. Woolie the madman
[3:15:20] <+AccioSkullar> ultimate could be so much better\
[3:15:21] <stropbopadopolis> ban everyone from ranked who isnt wired
[3:15:21] <poppy_marth> she's not really a ninja character in the traditional sense though
[3:15:26] <+AccioSkullar> like its already great dont get me wrong
[3:15:29] <+AccioSkullar> but you know
[3:15:31] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Cmon Woolz
[3:15:34] <Zicorth> Yes, it could be.
[3:15:37] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> do it for the Baby
[3:15:41] <Zicorth> That's partly why Ultimate is so frustrating.
[3:15:41] <$SilverRoddo> Boolieve in Woolie.
[3:15:44] <Zicorth> It COULD be a lot better.
[3:15:48] <+AccioSkullar> exactly
[3:15:48] <Zicorth> With small changes.
[3:15:56] <poppy_marth> 2saint got 13th at genesis, but that's true tbh
[3:15:56] <TheBrunoZone> Technical stuff is just not Nintendo's forte
[3:16:00] <VJdarkworld> Nice shot PogChamp
[3:16:04] <Smoofmaster> Michael is a p good puff

[3:16:15] <Smoofmaster> also prince abu and snowy
[3:16:15] <+AccioSkullar> MICHAEL 41 TRILLION
[3:16:17] <poppy_marth> puff doesn't have too much representation
[3:16:23] <Zicorth> Just play Melee, it has better movement/options by a TON than Ultimate, vastly better online, and some crazy community made tools/projects. :P
[3:16:25] <%NotTooLoudPls> are a lot of smash pros old-ish? like late 20s?
[3:16:26] <poppy_marth> I agree with you guys, its an outlier
[3:16:33] <+peri_d0t> ONE MORE
[3:16:42] <+doragonkiba> yeah, ultimate is legitimately a very fun game in offline multiplayer, it just sucks ass at anything to do with online, or training mode, or singleplayer. sick soundtrack, tho
[3:16:44] <Zicorth> Anyone know about Project Slippi?
[3:16:46] <Smoofmaster> @NotTooLoudPls most MELEE players are millenials
[3:16:47] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[3:16:49] <stropbopadopolis> michael still #1 on anthers?
[3:16:49] <+AccioSkullar> for sure
[3:16:59] <Smoofmaster> @NotTooLoudPls but smash in general? everything
[3:17:01] <xiccy> Or you could play Rivals instead
[3:17:01] <+AccioSkullar> woolz the recovery good
[3:17:14] <%NotTooLoudPls> ah okay
[3:17:22] <%linkwolf4> yo does skull have those tippers tho?
[3:17:27] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Don't let anime win
[3:17:27] <+doragonkiba> brawlhalla having better netcode than ultimate would be funny if it wasn't really sad
[3:17:36] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Cmon Woolzworth
[3:17:37] <PsychoFlash1> yeyeye melee time

[3:17:42] <%ofloofy> Zoomers DansGame wut
[3:17:46] <%Dr00_PhD> Gen Z
[3:17:46] <Smoofmaster> i mean, fornite kids probably arent playing melee
[3:17:47] <%NotTooLoudPls> no
[3:17:48] <RcMacPanther22> Zoomers ????
[3:17:49] <TheHeroAppears> @Toynota10 yes
[3:17:51] <%NotTooLoudPls> no zoomers
[3:17:53] <Sir_Walrus> Wait they taught woolie to extend grab and super wavedash but not regular wavedash? lmao
[3:17:54] <+peri_d0t> i'm a zoomer
[3:17:55] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Millenials are cool
[3:17:56] <stropbopadopolis> millenials are 85 to 98 i think
[3:17:57] <%ofloofy> XD thats so dumb
[3:18:00] <Zicorth> Project Slippi is going to be so big for Melee, 2 tournaments have already run it. Basically one thing you can do is stream Melee in HD to a stream using Dolphin, while people are playing Melee on CRTs, in REAL time.
[3:18:07] <Smoofmaster> if melee came out before you were born, you probably arent playing it
[3:18:12] <JetpackMcQuack> Floss kids
[3:18:12] <poppy_marth> marth on yoshis is rough for samus
[3:18:17] <+peri_d0t> yeah people are calling us zoomers
[3:18:18] <poppy_marth> this is defintely the counterpick
[3:18:19] <Nina96> man my parents got so lucky there generation X
[3:18:23] <poppy_marth> at least for me
[3:18:30] <Zicorth> You can also take control of either character, when playing it back since it records inputs.
[3:18:35] <%NotTooLoudPls> I wish I liked playing this game competitively, it's got a cool community
[3:18:35] <+pkmamsters> FloZZers
[3:18:36] <+a_deadbeat> Woolie's missiles are kinda nice
[3:18:42] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Im 92
[3:18:53] <Zicorth> The dev uploaded an automatic combo video, generated from over 3050 games.
[3:18:59] <%Dr00_PhD> Guess i'm in the tail end of millenial
[3:19:01] <+ledgefiend> I'm 21 and people always debate if Im a millennial when it comes up
[3:19:02] <+eanscrale> It's like saying 09ers
[3:19:02] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> basically turning to powder at 26
[3:19:03] <Nina96> its just a time frame really
[3:19:06] <lejeune> alright chat i don't want to be known as a zoomer for the rest of my life what else do we got
[3:19:07] <RcMacPanther22> I'm not no millnial.
[3:19:14] <poppy_marth> its just a generation, all of the generations have associated stereotypes
[3:19:16] <Zicorth> You can filter specific stuff, like combos, %s, anything i nthe game, it's super crazy.
[3:19:18] <%juxtest> He look good fo an 85 year old
[3:19:23] <+peri_d0t> @ledgefiend you're in between but I'd say you're a zoomer

[3:22:05] <+pkmamsters> @peri_d0t i agree!
[3:22:09] <Zicorth> Smash 4's online system was better than Ultimate's, it had less input lag and WAY less buffer, and it had stage builder.

[3:22:13] <poppy_marth> LUL Melee is actually insane
[3:22:17] <+peri_d0t> @zicorth well yeah but that doesnt retroactively make smash 4 bad. it's still a really solid game

[3:22:52] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Lets remember to thank Iwata for making Melee possible
[3:22:57] <Zicorth> Compared to every video game ever made, Smash 4 is definitely at the higher-end of that spectrum.
[3:22:58] <Noponiz> this game is SO GOOD
[3:22:58] <stropbopadopolis> i prefered For Glory too man 1 stock assist trophy matches

[3:24:18] <AFoolishPaper> @peri_d0t oh good im not crazy for liking a video game that isnt melee
[3:24:27] <%Skullgod> it came out as a f2p game with microtransactions @WoolieVersus
[3:24:29] <Zicorth> Ultimate is basically Smash 4.5, anyways. Kappa
[3:24:30] <%Skullgod> no one bought any

[3:32:21] <Sir_Walrus> Ultimate stole from smash city smh
[3:32:25] <aeonicvector> dude, i hope the find out about the clutch button
[3:32:26] <mercado94> i cant believe ultimate rip off slap city
[3:32:32] <sunnythedrunk> Nintendo stole that shit like the stole a bunch of stuff from PM
[3:32:33] <+Byurr> They will never find the clutch button LUL
[3:32:36] <+attackofthesage> There's a built in b reverse button in this game called "clutch" you use it by holding a direction and pressing L while using a move
[3:32:43] <mintsherry> clutch when
[3:32:44] <+attackofthesage> You can wavedash
[3:32:50] <Tedkenstein> clutch please
[3:32:51] <+attackofthesage> You can moonwalk too
[3:32:51] <mercado94> WAT
[3:32:52] <+Byurr> It has EVERY melee mechanic
[3:32:52] <%Ninestempest> when's clutch
[3:32:55] <+Byurr> almost every
[3:32:56] <ManOfReason> schmooving
[3:32:58] <+MarkOfRambo> C L U T C H
[3:33:01] <%TokyoCosmos> l cancel
[3:33:04] <lejeune> ultimate stole fighting games from the fighting games
[3:33:05] <straight_up_garbage> i look away for 5 minutes and suddenly we're playing poverty, ok, lets go then
[3:33:07] <@Menitta> I dig the look of this game
[3:33:16] <arkv01> it looks like a good smash alternative
[3:33:21] <babble_br> movementttttt
[3:33:23] <+peri_d0t> this game looks cheap in a good way
[3:33:24] <Zerouge> it has lots of charm
[3:33:25] <arkv01> like mix things up when you're like no, not smash tonight
[3:33:25] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @straight_up_garbage Whats poverty about this? Kappa
[3:33:26] <+attackofthesage> This imo is the best smash alternative
[3:33:32] <+sethan10> slap city kappa
[3:33:34] <+Byurr> AGREED
[3:33:38] <%Ninestempest> between this and rivals
[3:33:38] <+AccioSkullar> what does clutch do
[3:33:39] <VJdarkworld> I wish smash ultimate had the clutch button, such a good mechanic
[3:33:40] <Aya_namiko> Game had too many nerfs
[3:33:40] <babble_br> AGREED
[3:33:42] <+MarkOfRambo> Did you see that butt clutch?
[3:33:44] <MysticSlime> AGREED
[3:33:50] <thepardack> Not a huge fan of this game's look
[3:33:51] <CaptainPlanetWithMetalArm> this game is insane
[3:33:54] <CaliforniaPotatoPowers> it's like Smash if it wasn't intentionally designed to be casual only
[3:33:56] <+peri_d0t> I think smf2 is also a good alternative
[3:33:57] <lejeune> it's so meh looking its good
[3:33:58] <Aya_namiko> I liked it on release but meh
[3:34:01] <@Menitta> I still really like Rivals of Aether but that seems more like its own thing than a Smash alternative to me
[3:34:07] <JetpackMcQuack> It’s like you all just forgot about PlayStation allstars
[3:34:11] <CaptainPlanetWithMetalArm> the movement and actual play makes up for the look of the game
[3:34:12] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:34:15] <manstertruck> bcm needed those nerfs
[3:34:16] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Best Smash alternative is a real fighting game
[3:34:16] <+MarkOfRambo> Clutch can reverse momentum on certain moves, extend moonwalk, force lightshield, suppress fastfall, and many other things.
[3:34:16] <%Ninestempest> I suppose this game is a more direct analog
[3:34:22] <McHerpyDerps> I'm using Tilt controls!
[3:34:28] <manstertruck> set knockback up throw was broken
[3:34:32] <VorpalSlash> I like that it's a smash clone with characters that don't just steal movestets from smash
[3:34:33] <basedfer> Ketchup!
[3:34:34] <mintsherry> the key is jenny dtilt
[3:34:34] <+AccioSkullar> that sounds sick
[3:34:35] <stropbopadopolis> this is a lot slower looking than melee unfortunately
[3:34:37] <zeif00> what is this stage music
[3:34:38] <lejeune> ya rivals has some cool shit not in smash like the universal counter and no ledgegrab
[3:34:44] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @sethan10
[3:34:49] <%Ninestempest> only because they're new

[3:34:57] <Noponiz> this character is pre-incineroar.
[3:34:57] <%Ninestempest> comp in this game is mental
[3:34:58] <+Byurr> and they're playing the two slowest characters in the game
[3:34:59] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> !motivated
[3:34:59] <+Byurr> lmaoooo

[3:35:00] <babble_br> the ledge is sooooo good in this game
[3:35:06] <+sethan10> what is this game?
[3:35:10] <AFoolishPaper> !motivated
[3:35:12] <JetpackMcQuack> Smash has an unlimited budget at this point though
[3:35:14] <+Pungulator> Clutch is a mechanic that works similar to a B reverse, but reverses all momentum you have and can be used at any point in certain moves
[3:35:14] <+attackofthesage> @sethan10 Slap City
[3:35:14] <thisnameisnotcreative> This game gets pretty fast at higher levels

[3:36:38] <babble_br> least slap isnt just a menu screen unlike some other games
[3:36:40] <basedfer> eh it kinda had some life, but once ultimate hype was nonstop, it shot in the back, lenny style
[3:36:47] <mintsherry> can we ban sethan
[3:36:50] <SaltyDongs> is that a kingdom hearts?
[3:36:53] <+sethan10> 28.5 players @CaptainPlanetWithMetalArm

[3:40:29] <%WhyIDie> @basedfer not seeing anything that different system-wise, just a small gimmick
[3:40:30] <basedfer> @WhyIDie it helps that their characters arent designed just to steal smash stuff, their from their own games

[3:43:51] <%WhyIDie> @basedfer I'll concede to that point. different risks, like the playerbase falling off hard, in this game's case. trying new would risk not getting a playerbase to begin with, but reward is a more committed one if it's good
[3:43:52] <Laironx3> Complete Marketing Saturation

[3:45:57] <aeonicvector> @WoolieVersus Those QR codes lead to a story

[3:45:57] <CaptainPlanetWithMetalArm> Trust me all of you, if you get interested in the game join the Slap League discord tons of people to play and talk to with about the game
[3:46:01] <SaltyDongs> Earth-chan must fight
[3:46:04] <%WhyIDie> @basedfer oh yeah, I don't disagree branding plays a big role, like how poke go only worked because they slapped pokemon on it, was the same game before but without the branding and failed. but you also can't deny that branding brings more funding, and more polish to the established formula
[3:46:08] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @TheGershon

[3:46:41] <TheBrunoZone> Wow. I did not expect that....
[3:46:43] <+Byurr> the little spin move
[3:46:43] <VorpalSlash> You can extend Jenny's skateboard attack with the clutch button @WoolieVersus
[3:46:44] <+doragonkiba> the qr code is a reflection of your inner self. the qr code takes you to wherever your heart most needs to go. that's why everyone's answer is different. but also why half of them are porn.

[3:47:10] <Icematoro> Down B helps building a lot of money, but like, half of your attacks also give you Money
[3:47:16] <Icematoro> Clutch is a command
[3:47:16] <%TokyoCosmos> CLUTCH modifies move properties
[3:47:21] <CaptainPlanetWithMetalArm> @WoolieVersus with 400 dollars you can kill with fsmash at 30-40 percent
[3:47:22] <Icematoro> Try the left Trigger
[3:47:23] <Noponiz> Clutch is a big Quality of life button
[3:47:25] <lejeune> its so unfortunate when an actually good game in terms of mechanics and design but fails massively because no old ip to attach it to
[3:47:26] <Icematoro> Or L1
[3:47:27] <%TokyoCosmos> its a literal button
[3:47:31] <AncelDeLambert> look at this Dodger character
[3:47:33] <Noponiz> clutch is a unique mechanic to this game, no other way to call it
[3:47:36] <TheBrunoZone> @doragonkiba Is the QR code by any chance, 42?
[3:47:36] <AncelDeLambert> that's just Doogs
[3:47:41] <Tedkenstein> it does things
[3:47:43] <VJdarkworld> Clutch button is the clutch button
[3:47:44] <+skm742> when you clutch, you get a feather on your character indicator
[3:47:49] <+MarkOfRambo> A weird symbol appears above your head if you use the move.
[3:47:51] <%TokyoCosmos> some moves change how they act, it depends
[3:47:52] <Icematoro> When you press it you get a symbol at the side of your Tag
[3:47:54] <babble_br> something i heard verbatim from an ulti player “holding clutch makes you play better”
[3:47:54] <PikaThePikachu> Modifies specific moves
[3:47:54] <VorpalSlash> Dash attack or downtilt skateboard, don't remember
[3:47:59] <Aya_namiko> there will be an icon over your character's head when you hold it
[3:47:59] <Icematoro> Only a couple moves get modified
[3:48:00] <%TokyoCosmos> there is a visual confirmation
[3:48:04] <CaptainPlanetWithMetalArm> @WoolieVersus the feather is only from jump
[3:48:05] <VorpalSlash> It's been a hot minute
[3:48:08] <thisnameisnotcreative> In most cases it'll reverse moves including momentum
[3:48:09] <+Pungulator> It modifies certain moves depending on the character
[3:48:11] <CaptainPlanetWithMetalArm> it shows if you have a jump
[3:48:11] <%Ninestempest> @woolieversus clutch is the name of the button. it let's you reverse b, not fast fall, always dash when you use the stick, and so much more
[3:48:13] <manstertruck> clutch b reverses some moves @woolieversus

[3:48:26] <Noponiz> @WoolieVersus you see an icon next to your tag when you clutch. it does a lot of shit like light shields, wavebouncing or move specific stuff

[3:48:39] <Icematoro> LT
[3:48:45] <Noponiz> Clutch is basically the quality of life button
[3:48:45] <wbo69> you can check controls
[3:48:47] <thisnameisnotcreative> There's a ton of movement shenanigans clutch can do
[3:48:51] <aeonicvector> clutch can also be used as a reversal on many airmoves and ground moves like goddesses side smash
[3:49:01] <+Byurr> Clutch PogChamp
[3:49:03] <Cypher_Ranger_PhazON> Goddess of Explosions can clutch her Fsmash and turn her around for mix ups.
[3:49:20] <Icematoro> Goddess has an Instakill too!
[3:49:28] <+DeeJayOkay> TOR
[3:49:28] <+Byurr> Press it during the move

[3:49:47] <+MarkOfRambo> Ittle can clutch neutral, side and down specials.
[3:49:48] <aeonicvector> and that works on ALOT of air moves
[3:49:50] <%ofloofy> THAT MOMENTUM
[3:49:52] <+DeeJayOkay> CRANK THAT FUCKING MUSIC
[3:49:55] <+Byurr> Ittle can clutch all of her special moves and her airstrong
[3:50:01] <Tedkenstein> try it with other moves
[3:50:07] <%Ninestempest> yeah that momentum is so slow guys
[3:50:13] <%Ninestempest> slowest smash game
[3:50:15] <mintsherry> butt clutch mannn
[3:50:16] <+thunderhog> seems pretty...clutch
[3:50:17] <Icematoro> Have Goddess Grab you and Hold the Taunt Button
[3:50:21] <Noponiz> goddess fireball is like a cooler king dedede gordo
[3:50:24] <Icematoro> Don't do anything until that's done!
[3:50:29] <udderlyunbearable> ittle's down b can be clutched and jump cancelled
[3:50:31] <lejeune> what a clutch button haha lol XD lmao
[3:50:32] <kuningaz45> CRANKDAT MUSIC
[3:50:35] <stropbopadopolis> slower than brawl for sure
[3:50:37] <Tedkenstein> oh ya, goddess can press taunt when she grab someone
[3:50:50] <+Pungulator> If Goddess lands a grab, press the Dpad for a taunt throw @WoolieVersus
[3:50:50] <nmaten> kind of like ex button in mk
[3:50:57] <+MarkOfRambo> Ittle down special and side special are her coolest moves imo.
[3:51:04] <lejeune> it is almost like this game has unique mechanics
[3:51:04] <+ledgefiend> or kind of like Dante's stances
[3:51:07] <+Byurr> just wait
[3:51:07] <Icematoro> Hold it
[3:51:08] <udderlyunbearable> rambo what are you doing
[3:51:09] <mintsherry> YES
[3:51:11] <PikaThePikachu> Don't mash out
[3:51:13] <Icematoro> Don't touch anything
[3:51:14] <PikaThePikachu> Let it happen
[3:51:15] <VJdarkworld> Clutch button is sick
[3:51:16] <Icematoro> Let it build!
[3:51:16] <Cypher_Ranger_PhazON> LET IT CHARGE!!!!!
[3:51:16] <Noponiz> dont mash out
[3:51:18] <+Byurr> Its like Galaxy Punch
[3:51:19] <yakuzaspirit> yo smash's graphics are weird
[3:51:20] <DaGodKira> Goddess can Dandy step with clutch button with her side smash
[3:51:20] <+DoomGoesBoom> @MarkOfRambo lying to chat like this
[3:51:20] <+MarkOfRambo> LET IT HAPPEN
[3:51:22] <CaliforniaPotatoPowers> it's almost like they intentionally designed the game to be played at a higher level
[3:51:23] <+Byurr> where you just let it happen
[3:51:24] <+Byurr> uh oh
[3:51:29] <babble_br> little duuuuude
[3:51:35] <thisnameisnotcreative> Don't mash
[3:51:40] <+MarkOfRambo> @DoomGoesBoom I speak the truth.
[3:51:41] <Icematoro> Anything will cancel it, so don't!
[3:51:42] <DatAsuna> woolie no coaching!
[3:51:44] <+MarkOfRambo> :)
[3:51:47] <Cypher_Ranger_PhazON> OMG HERE WE GO

[3:51:57] <DaGodKira> Goddess can Dandy step with clutch button with her side smash
[3:51:59] <%ofloofy> PLANET BUSTING JUPITER
[3:51:59] <Icematoro> GALACTIC CRUSHER!
[3:51:59] <+Hilleltaco> PogChamp
[3:51:59] <ManOfReason> planet breaker???
[3:52:03] <Tedkenstein> GODDESS BUSTER
[3:52:05] <babble_br> beautiful composition
[3:52:07] <straight_up_garbage> roada fucken roller
[3:52:07] <masterfire23> damn is this early evo footage? PogChamp
[3:52:10] <Laironx3> I can't believe Saturn is dead
[3:52:13] <VJdarkworld> PLANET BUSTAAAAH
[3:52:21] <Noponiz> @WoolieVersus she also has a thing when you charge her fsmash all the way, but you need a stage with more uninterupted ground
[3:52:21] <Tedkenstein> cant believe remedy's home planet is dead
[3:52:22] <dracojammin> jermaSaturn
[3:52:27] <+Repiteo> Slap City is sick lads
[3:52:28] <pantherpiss2> i mean there is a gigaton punch here
[3:52:31] <saniblues> F
[3:52:33] <Tedkenstein> LOL
[3:52:34] <udderlyunbearable> oh good they found bomb
[3:52:37] <+MarkOfRambo> Pick Fancy Ruins next!
[3:52:45] <Icematoro> Funnily enough she has another one, You have to hold Taunt at the end of her F-Smash
[3:52:47] <+Byurr> L cancelling in this game conserves your aerial momentum instead of lowering end lag
[3:52:48] <babble_br> gotttemmm
[3:52:55] <aeonicvector> you can also use the orb to cover your forward smash
[3:52:56] <Icematoro> You might need to clutch tho
[3:53:03] <+Cyoctane> Uh
[3:53:08] <Tedkenstein> clutch and enough room
[3:53:10] <+MarkOfRambo> Use the ground pound move as Ittle (down special).
[3:53:16] <+StormClaymore> doodGore doodBeamL doodBeam doodBeam doodBeam doodBeam doodBeam doodBeam doodBeam doodBeamR
[3:53:19] <Tedkenstein> then clutch it
[3:53:21] <Noponiz> @WoolieVersus with goddess fsmash charge off the stage for big momentum, then side b with clutch to reverse back onto stage. Big style
[3:53:28] <spoobertt> ministun lol
[3:53:59] <Noponiz> clutch side b
[3:53:59] <+MarkOfRambo> SIT MOVE
[3:53:59] <saniblues> rip
[3:54:01] <manstertruck> @woolieversus this game has l cancelling but instead of lowering lag is conserves momentum from air to ground
[3:54:03] <stropbopadopolis> ittles dair looks really useful
[3:54:04] <aeonicvector> it does work, but not super easily
[3:54:04] <Kyrobun> clutch with neutral b or side b
[3:54:06] <Icematoro> Nono, you clutch a move with the momentum
[3:54:07] <%ofloofy> Bamboozled
[3:54:08] <TheBrunoZone> Ohhh... :(
[3:54:09] <Kyrobun> after you are off the stage
[3:54:13] <babble_br> bro nerf the sitting move
[3:54:13] <+Cyoctane> Did they enable ads for Prime?
[3:54:17] <McHerpyDerps> clutch side b
[3:54:21] <saniblues> It's safer to clutch neutral b than side b
[3:54:25] <pickleweasel4321> this....this isn't melee
[3:54:29] <HammerNNail> You can wave dash in this game.
[3:54:31] <thisnameisnotcreative> clutch only applies to certain moves
[3:54:32] <+Byurr> its better
[3:54:36] <+MarkOfRambo> Ittle Down Special (Butt Move)
[3:54:40] <+Byurr> pokeM
[3:54:42] <Noponiz> gotta side b with clutch to reverse momentum as her
[3:54:43] <kuningaz45> Woolie I need you to stop and try clutch neutral. It'll let you appreciate this stage
[3:54:51] <pickleweasel4321> @Byurr that's a hard sell
[3:54:57] <saniblues> neutral b can be reversed as well
[3:54:58] <@Menitta> Woah
[3:55:14] <aeonicvector> woolie learning that tech, i love it
[3:55:14] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:55:14] <saniblues> and you don't have to worry about the fireball being active since it won't clutch reverse if the fireball is out
[3:55:17] <mintsherry> stream froze oof
[3:55:21] <Deadpool2450> stream die for anyone else?
[3:55:22] <%ofloofy> F

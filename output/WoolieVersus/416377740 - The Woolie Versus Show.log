[0:03:46] <+C0rdak> How long does the pre-stream usually last?
[0:03:47] <SunsetJack> GG has the weirdest neutral and mix up game...
[0:04:08] <%shmupdogjoe> GG taught me how to anime and now I think *UNIST* has the weirdest neutral and mixup game
[0:04:10] <+Cavumentum> I can't believe Woolie sacrificed the metaphysical existence of a kompetent MK11 PC port to the Eclipse to get into RT with Pat
[0:04:13] <dsauce999> I can't wait for Woolie to choose the boss characters (need to spread these stale memes for the new RT crowd)
[0:04:15] <ninjacodeman> whens mahvel?
[0:04:21] <@Solidus_113> I wish every fighting game had crossplay
[0:04:26] <brambobelurkin> the lore runs deep
[0:04:37] <+Shotgundam009> Yo
[0:04:43] <SunsetJack> Yo man, 0F grab in GG and how much you can apply YRC is why I think it makes the game weird/wild.
[0:04:53] <gnarly_memes_bro> all that RT money going straight to his POCKETS
[0:04:54] <SomersaultJustice> this stream is so early
[0:04:59] <@akuda_bar> pocketsssss

[0:05:12] <%shmupdogjoe> The inability to block air to ground messes up me with more traditional fighters

[0:05:45] <@Solidus_113> don't talk about endgame at all
[0:05:48] <@akuda_bar> i know you weren't gonna

[0:05:52] <SunsetJack> I mean, you say traditional but SF can't block in the air except Alpha series I think?
[0:05:55] <+Proxzo> haven't watched it yet

[0:06:25] <%shmupdogjoe> Yes SunsetJack, that's what I'm saying. In traditional (non-"Anime") fighters I get messed up by how much of a commitment just jumping is

[0:29:00] <le_francie> aight
[0:29:05] <$konekoryugamine> Johnny strikes me as the kind of guy who would hit on a villain as he fights her and then ask her to fuck him after he wins.
[0:29:06] <+Koover> you can YRC if baiken guardpoints your button right?

[0:29:47] <$konekoryugamine> AND now Johnny strikes me as a JoJo character that never saw the light of day from Araki
[0:29:47] <NumberTooBig> good try at least
[0:29:49] <MTLxSpider> but guard point yes
[0:29:54] <%shmupdogjoe> To be fair, have you seen the villains in this game? If you could kick Ramlethal out of bed, well maybe you just aren't into ladies
[0:30:00] <le_francie> johnny is me favourite beginner characters huehuehuehuehueh

[0:38:33] <+Dull_Fangs> Top Montreal player coming through
[0:38:37] <%GohanEgret> woolieVERGIN woolieVERGIN woolieVERGIN woolieVERGIN
[0:38:42] <alexthemaestro7> morale go down
[0:38:44] <+ChiefWilly> @Vashido22 Close enough
[0:38:44] <+KaiSnow> OOOOFFFF
[0:38:47] <gnarly_memes_bro> ive been thinking of shaving my head so I can join vsauce, do you think ginger beard is a deal breaker?
[0:38:49] <sodapopSquid> The Turn around!?
[0:38:53] <AzureKayZ> Iron Tager is still cooler tho.
[0:38:56] <thepiefoot> You can't escape !
[0:39:11] <+ChansonNoire> in what world is tager cooler than potemkin
[0:39:14] <$FuqBoiSlim> Hey vsauce, Michael here. How many times can a man be bodied before he quits FGs forever? let's find out
[0:39:22] <@akuda_bar> I've missed the sound of fightsticks
[0:39:22] <+KaiSnow> jabu jabu jabu
[0:39:25] <labanderox> tager has a cooler design but potemkin is way more hype
[0:39:25] <+Whens_Marbles> !0-3
[0:39:26] <NumberTooBig> @AzureKayZ no... no he isnt
[0:39:33] <Vashido22> @AzureKayZ Tager has a thing going on with Bullet, so he wins by default
[0:39:37] <AzureKayZ> King of Tager though.
[0:39:46] <thepiefoot> Xrd Pot > Previous Pot > Tager
[0:39:55] <+0ni0n_L0rd> IS that mike from V sauce?
[0:39:59] <+Dull_Fangs> Lol what
[0:40:05] <MTLxSpider> vanilla accent core Potemkin
[0:40:07] <+ChansonNoire> in this matchup with baiken you stand still outside of pot's 5HS range and you just punish
[0:40:07] <+Taglog7> I'm here for Woolie-Aid
[0:40:13] <@akuda_bar> so far she can smell his colon
[0:40:13] <gnarly_memes_bro> no is shmicheal from Psauce
[0:40:21] <labanderox> both tager and potemkin are cool though
[0:40:33] <%linkwolf4> one buster == two full combos with any other character.
[0:40:41] <@akuda_bar> @0ni0n_l0rd it's bryce the hentai child
[0:40:45] <+Dull_Fangs> Yeah so does every other characters
[0:40:46] <ilasper1> you need kire tatami yrec
[0:40:47] <%shmupdogjoe> I wonder if Baiken has any good gatling options to stop a hammerfall
[0:40:56] <+Ryu_R> tager looks like a guilty gear npc LUL
[0:40:58] <ReNhoSoft1> Yep, without Kire tatami this mu suuuucks for baiken
[0:41:00] <+nrv3tv> anyone know what stick hes using
[0:41:15] <NumberTooBig> Tager looks fine in portrait, but his walk, his arms on the sprite, everything is slightly off to me
[0:41:19] <gnarly_memes_bro> iron tager always looked like knock-off hellboy to me
[0:41:22] <ZaibatsuFan> I don't WANNA tatami mat! I wanna DUST LOOP! BabyRage
[0:41:26] <le_francie> remember when potemkin could buster in the air for 25% tension
[0:41:28] <@akuda_bar> @woolieversus @nrv3tv wants to know what stick bryce uses
[0:41:29] <+Dull_Fangs> Has woolie not seen high level baikens where they play defensive neutral with mat
[0:41:29] <MTLxSpider> @nrv3tv hori viewlix
[0:41:38] <labanderox> i love tager's magnetism grappler gimmick though
[0:41:45] <thepiefoot> Black out
[0:41:46] <@akuda_bar> or i guess mtl knows lol
[0:41:48] <+Dull_Fangs> Like just do that and play around flick
[0:41:51] <spinbel> Does he do viewer matches?
[0:41:52] <MTLxSpider> same stick they use at japaenese arcades

[0:42:44] <@akuda_bar> @spinbel he may in a while
[0:42:48] <MTLxSpider> its the color of Quebec
[0:42:52] <gnarly_memes_bro> the woolie hole runs deep with forbidden lore, but houses pies yet unkown to the souls bold enough to dive in
[0:42:52] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:42:55] <+ChansonNoire> @Dull_Fangs woolie often gets fixated on his own weird idea of what matchups are in his mind

[0:42:59] <+Dull_Fangs> Hit him on the way down with a normal
[0:42:59] <DotDusk> Good, Woolie's beautiful visage was distracting me from the spicy gameplay

[0:50:06] <gnarly_memes_bro> M E R E L Y F A N T A S Y
[0:50:07] <%Solidnick18> it's fiction
[0:50:07] <%shmupdogjoe> Be fair. Only Chip can actually be 100%'d by Slayer in Danger Time
[0:50:08] <ManOfReason> "false, unture, it wasnt real, a fabrication"
[0:50:12] <labanderox> slayer vs chipp in danger time is the best spectacle
[0:50:13] <%shmupdogjoe> Chipp?
[0:50:14] <%linkwolf4> this one was created by a writer
[0:50:17] <le_francie> the bluff is to change characters
[0:50:24] <NumberTooBig> @madogod their saving it for the Kusoge section Kappa
[0:50:27] <%fattness132> "i jumped" an urban legend that never happened

[0:51:01] <prime_name> What was your plan, Reggie?
[0:51:06] <%shmupdogjoe> Potemkin backstep is basically an SNK roll

[0:54:21] <torrenz420> the heart on his glove is a reference to matoi rukio's sailor suit in kill la kill
[0:54:23] <ELJOVENBATALI> ah yes, the superior gundam series

[1:06:53] <%UrsulaCat> Let’s just have sex instead
[1:06:55] <zecht89> I hope the next GG is a bit more like Accent Core
[1:06:58] <spinbel> @Solidus_113 You have less health and it sometimes prevents you from doing the optimal combos in Stylish.
[1:07:01] <torrenz420> it's diva
[1:07:06] <%UrsulaCat> Of fighting
[1:07:09] <+Tiewolf> @Solidus_113 you can do alot of combos and there are force drops

[1:11:03] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:11:08] <RVMSpeedWagon> What’s the most complex character to play? I’m curious I know next to nothing about this game. Just love your get into fighting games.
[1:11:26] <NumberTooBig> @juxtest working in a weapons program that destroyed the world, pretty melodramatic if you ask me Kappa
[1:11:31] <%linkwolf4> what are some good characters to play as a beginner? @WoolieVersus
[1:11:32] <Boonool> johnny is the most comlex
[1:11:34] <DarkVinceX> Zato, I guess
[1:11:39] <labanderox> i would say Zato
[1:11:39] <gnarly_memes_bro> @NumberTooBig BAD. im just messing around really, i have a very hard time with 2d fighters in general so i tend to drop off
[1:11:40] <GenericSoda> @rvmspeedwagon answer, venom and zato probably. haehyun is also really wxecution heavy
[1:11:42] <Boonool> and zato too yea
[1:11:53] <+ChansonNoire> ah yes Ky stun edge yrc, skidaddle skedoodle, I know control the neutral
[1:12:00] <torrenz420> pot has easy basics and extremely demanding optimal corner stuff
[1:12:00] <RVMSpeedWagon> Thanks for the answers guys
[1:12:01] <ghostravens> is slayer good for beginners? if not, who is?
[1:12:01] <gnarly_memes_bro> @NumberTooBig more of a tekken man personally
[1:12:11] <GenericSoda> @linkwolf4 sol, ky, slayer, axl, and may
[1:12:28] <GenericSoda> slayer has a very high skill ceiling
[1:12:31] <+ChansonNoire> Sam dit yo yrc c ass
[1:12:32] <torrenz420> slayer isn't a bad starter, his combos are pretty easy and intuitive apart from j2k loops
[1:12:42] <DarkVinceX> fuck le yrc
[1:12:52] <+Shotgundam009> BlessRNG
[1:13:01] <%ironohki> Hi, my girlfriend is making me watch the NFL Draft. Don't tell her I'm hiding in Woolie playing fitegams.
[1:13:02] <%shmupdogjoe> Yellow Roman Cancel. You can slap three buttons to cancel a move during its startup at the cost of 25% meter
[1:13:05] <gnarly_memes_bro> it also does not help me that like woolie, i refuse to play anyone but my favorite. except MY favorite is venom
[1:13:05] <GenericSoda> dash cancel into dandy step is mad hard though
[1:13:10] <NumberTooBig> all of the assassins are really complex
[1:13:12] <%shmupdogjoe> oh wait, "fuck le yrc" not "the fuck is yrc"
[1:13:15] <+Shotgundam009> 6p'd the camera
[1:13:19] <%shmupdogjoe> I answered a non-question
[1:13:27] <GenericSoda> Millia isnt THAT hard
[1:13:27] <Naroth_> Ky
[1:13:28] <skywardknight0> any tips with chip
[1:13:29] <mistersups> Ky
[1:13:31] <torrenz420> @ghostravens most people would recommend ky to start with but I like raven, it's very easy to set up his looping gameplan
[1:13:50] <@Solidus_113> I found Chipp easy to use
[1:13:51] <leroypi> What about Bedman?
[1:13:54] <labanderox> Ky is the Ryu of the game
[1:13:55] <gnarly_memes_bro> YEYEYEYEYE VENOM BOYS
[1:14:00] <DarkVinceX> Bedman is Deadman
[1:14:10] <GenericSoda> @leroypi i main bedman, i think he's pretty easy
[1:14:10] <DarkVinceX> let him rest
[1:14:15] <Mrbaconator> what about potempkin
[1:14:16] <labanderox> Kum and slayer are both link heavy
[1:14:20] <Jetsfantasy> I was the sick fuck that played Jack-O
[1:14:24] <Naroth_> BDC boys
[1:14:27] <Naroth_> fuck blocking
[1:14:28] <GenericSoda> dont play potemkin lol
[1:14:29] <+Koover> the links have a 3F leniency so they're not to bad
[1:14:29] <%Wool> is there any functional difference between rapid cancel in BB and Roman cancel besides the time slow

[1:14:58] <LoadingFWANK> I started with faust and still getting bopped BUT enjoying it
[1:14:59] <NumberTooBig> Potemkin isnt complex and can get you far with his damage output, good luck against someone who's played against Pot before
[1:15:00] <mistersups> Camera again.
[1:15:02] <$FuqBoiSlim> Any I-no boys in the chat??? 4Head
[1:15:03] <+ChansonNoire> potemkin is pretty easy, his matchups are all hard
[1:15:04] <spec__> High level Sol is just pretending to be a stupid mashing gorilla
[1:15:12] <Jetsfantasy> I've missed this game
[1:15:16] <ShreddingPixels> Why block when I can teleport 4Head
[1:15:18] <GenericSoda> Leo is unga

[1:15:42] <+NPCMatro> play may
[1:15:42] <GenericSoda> I dont think Raven shoukd be your beginner because he might ingrain bad habits
[1:15:52] <%shmupdogjoe> Only play May if you like fun, and joy
[1:15:54] <gnarly_memes_bro> @WoolieVersus the biggest booty. i refuse to not play venom
[1:15:56] <+Koover> FAB makes pot look top tier though
[1:16:08] <labanderox> the ultimate disrespect is dizzy into instant kill :)
[1:16:26] <leroypi> @spec__ that is bold of you to say when you're in dust loop range
[1:16:42] <+SilentSEOUL> Man I've been deciding on whether to play either GG or BB:CF just want to say this has been a pretty nice stream
[1:16:46] <gnarly_memes_bro> i just like the way the balls move really i dont even wanna win most the time
[1:16:46] <%shmupdogjoe> going into IK mode guarantees your opponent can mash out of dizzy because it knocks two birdies off their little dizzy animation
[1:16:50] <+Koover> proration and guts
[1:17:06] <skywardknight0> hows the online scene
[1:17:19] <spec__> Sol is fun but everyone plays him ;_;
[1:17:22] <GenericSoda> its a little dead, but theres always a few rooms
[1:17:29] <+ChansonNoire> stay OUTSIDE of his normals range
[1:17:33] <GenericSoda> just dont play ranked and youll find people
[1:17:37] <+Koover> gotta FD the first hits and jump after hammerfall
[1:17:40] <Naroth_> learning to fuzzy jump against potempkin is super useful
[1:17:46] <EL_TRO> Is that Brice?
[1:17:47] <spec__> does baiken activate the tomboy reaction
[1:17:47] <NumberTooBig> GG is going strong but you should use discord for netplay
[1:17:58] <torrenz420> his normals are big but he gets stuffed
[1:18:04] <labanderox> @shmupdogjoe some people don't have fast enough fingers to mash out of dizzy :)
[1:18:04] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:18:05] <+Koover> when he cancels thats where the mindgame happens
[1:18:12] <torrenz420> 2p is his only fast button and it has no reward outside of point blank range
[1:18:32] <GenericSoda> show me them hammerfall cancela
[1:18:59] <jubejube56> I'd imagine if Baiken can azami speeding traffic she can azami hammerfall
[1:19:15] <ilasper1> then you can yrc pot bustered
[1:19:17] <ilasper1> get*
[1:19:19] <GenericSoda> hammerfall has armor though
[1:19:42] <+Koover> also if he YRC's the armor goes away
[1:20:08] <GenericSoda> armored moves can be yrc'd after the hit though
[1:20:18] <+NPCMatro> i cna never find a fucking match on pc
[1:20:24] <+Koover> true, thats where the yomi layers kick in
[1:20:47] <GenericSoda> @npcmatro are you playing ranked or hitting up rooms?
[1:20:58] <+NPCMatro> both
[1:21:00] <+SilentSEOUL> Wondering where do most people play Xrd PC or PS4?
[1:21:15] <leroypi> Dumb question, but what is YRC/ What does it stand for?
[1:21:16] <SnowCrane> Hello
[1:21:17] <+Koover> gotta FD in the air
[1:21:29] <+Koover> super jump FD airdash
[1:21:39] <+ChansonNoire> the best answer to being against potemkin in the corner is dont
[1:21:47] <GenericSoda> @leroypi its the game's cancel mechanic, it means yellow roman cancel
[1:21:51] <gnarly_memes_bro> one crazy trick! potemkin mains HATE HIM! CLICK HERE
[1:22:03] <leroypi> @GenericSoda tjamls
[1:22:07] <leroypi> Thanks
[1:22:19] <+inoboyz> OSFrog
[1:22:24] <labanderox> FD saves lives
[1:22:36] <GenericSoda> @leroypi if you see a colored ring appear around somebody and time slows, thats a roman cancle. there are three types that occur depending on the state
[1:22:50] <%Solidnick18> sbfpScared
[1:22:54] <leroypi> ok
[1:23:13] <+inoboyz> just play perfect
[1:23:23] <+PalmtopNami> love you woolie
[1:23:27] <@Solidus_113> If anyone wants to get into Xrd, the game plus all DLC is on sale for $15 right now https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/guilty-gear-xrd-revelator-and-rev-2-all-in-one-and-dlc-characters
[1:23:41] <NumberTooBig> on PC btw
[1:23:44] <GenericSoda> oh shit what up @inoboyz
[1:23:54] <GoldeNOVA> @WoolieVersus I have some issues "tuning my brain" to advanced play in fighting games in general, wrapping my brain around what combos and what doesn't is difficult sometimes, the best I got was in KOF XIII, what would be the best way/game to learn?
[1:24:11] <+inoboyz> SeriousSloth
[1:24:21] <GenericSoda> TehePelo
[1:24:21] <gnarly_memes_bro> i swear why do I ever pay retail price for games anymore thats a steal right there
[1:24:44] <NumberTooBig> @GoldeNOVA lab it out, take it to arcade to test it against a lot of characters. then take it online
[1:25:05] <%qazwsxedc168> wait hasnt woolie played gg a bunch before?
[1:25:05] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:25:08] <+ChansonNoire> @GoldeNOVA if you dont want to worry about combos while learning, try koihime enbu or the upcoming samurai shodown
[1:25:32] <gnarly_memes_bro> @qazwsxedc168 yeah, labbing is just part of the get into fightinggames formula
[1:25:41] <+Koover> blitz is plus I think
[1:25:58] <GoldeNOVA> @NumberTooBig Taking it to the lab is the issue, tuning my brain to work on the frames and what connects and what doesn't is really difficult.
[1:26:00] <ScreamingMeat> @WoolieVersus Use Baiken's boobs to intimidate your opponent
[1:26:05] <GenericSoda> @koover its only plus at full charge
[1:26:05] <%qazwsxedc168> ya ik @gnarly_memes_bro i played gg but i ment specifically bc he didnt know about blitzing back blitz shields
[1:26:26] <%Vegaburd> Vegaburd subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! is that vsauce?
[1:26:37] <+Shotgundam009> yes
[1:26:41] <%fattness132> I love the look of this game, but it has so many systems and depth that for me its nigh impossible to get anywhere with it.
[1:26:44] <%Vegaburd> cool
[1:26:45] <gnarly_memes_bro> o idk, i just meant that he always spends time in the lab on these streams
[1:26:46] <GoldeNOVA> @ChansonNoire Combo-light games are absolutely my jam, butI also want to not job too hard in anime fighters
[1:27:03] <+ChansonNoire> try unist and work your way up
[1:27:36] <gustavozxd> play the tutorial
[1:27:49] <gustavozxd> the tutorial for this game is really good
[1:27:49] <+ChansonNoire> or even then, GG has some characters that are not too combo focused
[1:28:18] <+ChansonNoire> more about being able to convert into knockdown
[1:28:25] <+inoboyz> play ino
[1:28:45] <%qazwsxedc168> wellllllllll
[1:28:59] <RVMSpeedWagon> Who is combo light? @chansonnoire
[1:29:04] <NumberTooBig> @GoldeNOVA you dont think of it as singular presses into singular presses, you think of it as a sequence of several small combos to get your long combos down, you dont think about what buttons to press when your focused on the mixups coming in
[1:29:28] <+ChansonNoire> well, the two characters on screen arent too combo focused
[1:29:33] <NumberTooBig> muscles have memory for a reason
[1:29:35] <GenericSoda> every characyer with a 6k has throw invuln iirc
[1:29:38] <RVMSpeedWagon> Fair enough
[1:29:52] <gustavozxd> is Baiken better than when she came out now?
[1:29:58] <+ChansonNoire> kinda
[1:30:45] <NumberTooBig> baiken was buffed to low mid tier instead of useless tier
[1:31:15] <%its_x23> hey vsauce michael here
[1:31:28] <+NPCMatro> i wanna see may or millia
[1:31:34] <ScreamingMeat> Baikin aggressively wobbles and presents her breasts when she walks to assert her dominance and intimidate lesser fighters
[1:32:27] <+Koover> throws are weird in this game
[1:32:27] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:32:31] <%The_Esquana> The_Esquana subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 5 month streak! Baiken for Shodown?
[1:32:44] <NumberTooBig> so pot buster cant be blitzed then?
[1:32:46] <Kaendorth> actual throws are nuts in this game
[1:32:48] <+Koover> fausts command grab is also an unbockable strike
[1:32:53] <+ChansonNoire> @WoolieVersus the difference why its an unblockable hit is because you can combo into them
[1:33:02] <labanderox> @Koover its actually the OG SFII style grabbing which was proximity based
[1:33:05] <Kaendorth> it was the hardest part for me to grasp when i started with gg
[1:33:29] <GenericSoda> you gotta option select the throws
[1:33:43] <odiemikes> anime fighters activate!
[1:33:52] <mistersups> Fizz is top 3 character select themes.
[1:33:57] <ShreddingPixels> I hope they announce a new GG this Evo.
[1:33:59] <labanderox> also i find GG the hardest game to play multiple characters in because of how much depth and how different each character is
[1:34:19] <RVMSpeedWagon> Wait isn’t one of these dudes “the president of the US” in the games lore?
[1:34:32] <mtlwolf_> yes
[1:34:36] <labanderox> Chipp
[1:34:37] <RVMSpeedWagon> Nice
[1:34:37] <mtlwolf_> and he's a weeb
[1:34:37] <NumberTooBig> @ShreddingPixels considering Granblue it wont be for a while, at most in concept art
[1:34:40] <+ChansonNoire> @GoldeNOVA characters that arent too combo focused are dizzy, faust, jack-o, axl, baiken, pot and leo. you will still need to practice with them to convert into knockdown
[1:34:43] <+ChansonNoire> main part of the game
[1:35:03] <labanderox> Chipp is a ninja and a president :x
[1:35:13] <%qazwsxedc168> johnny is so fucking cool
[1:35:13] <RVMSpeedWagon> Fantastic
[1:35:22] <Kaendorth> i agree @labanderox , also combos and conversions are really different from one char to another
[1:35:23] <%qazwsxedc168> i wish i was technical enough to play him
[1:35:30] <mistersups> Django Django
[1:35:35] <+og_lunchbox> Best song on the soundtrack right there
[1:35:42] <GenericSoda> leo is kind of combo heavy, his best stuff are extended combos in the corner
[1:36:17] <GenericSoda> Leo is a scum though, him and Chipp deserve to be executed
[1:36:19] <+ChansonNoire> just like pot but, that only wins rounds, that wont win you your games
[1:36:25] <+Koover> I love 4 tiger sword kicks
[1:36:36] <+Koover> its so satisfying
[1:36:38] <labanderox> one of kum's hardest combos consist of pressing the same move 3-5 times ;u;
[1:36:48] <GenericSoda> Haehyun is my gaborote character to watch because she's soooo technical
[1:36:52] <SaltyDongs> Do combbo
[1:37:14] <labanderox> donkey kick loops are the best though
[1:37:41] <+ChansonNoire> johnny is so ridiculous LUL
[1:38:02] <+Koover> lvl 3 wallsplat atpCrab
[1:38:21] <%serranobros> serranobros subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months!

[1:38:35] <fmc009> Johny LUL
[1:38:40] <ShreddingPixels> I can't believe they buffed Johnny.
[1:39:00] <MTLxSpider> theres only 1 johnny that is threatening and its omito
[1:39:02] <NumberTooBig> Buff Johnny, Nerf Answer
[1:39:24] <GenericSoda> better nerf bedman's 6p
[1:39:25] <ShreddingPixels> Answer deserves to be good SwiftRage
[1:39:28] <labanderox> Answer mains like to suffer Kappa
[1:39:28] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:39:45] <%jinking79> to bad in arcade mode the cpu get a ex super
[1:39:58] <ShreddingPixels> Answer is too cool to be as mediocre as he is.
[1:40:51] <UnknownGerm> these tutorials are great, but they don't really give an idea of when you should be using
[1:40:57] <UnknownGerm> them
[1:41:10] <ManOfReason> I mean, sometimes proximity normals are neccessary because certain directional normals are too fast etc
[1:41:12] <mtlwolf_> pretty they tell you
[1:41:15] <mtlwolf_> pretty sure*
[1:41:31] <Kaendorth> they kinda do it's just not explicit hahaha
[1:41:35] <mtlwolf_> what are your characters tools and what they are used for
[1:42:39] <MTLxSpider> this game has a universal tutorial for stuff like that.
[1:42:55] <MTLxSpider> game actually has a tutorial about fundementals
[1:43:12] <Kaendorth> this game's tutorials, trials and stuff are some of the best in modern fgs
[1:43:38] <GoldeNOVA> @WoolieVersus Are you checking out older fighting games? Maybe some older SamSho when the collection comes out?
[1:44:04] <drefizz> Guilty gear deserves more of a spotlight...but at the same time I dont want it to be flooded with filth
[1:44:15] <labanderox> Guilty Gear, Skullgirls, and UNIST have the best in game tutorials, but i feel like they all lack one thing that street fighter has, which is teaching you what each character's gameplan is
[1:44:45] <mtlwolf_> hmmm idk about that
[1:44:53] <Kitsunerasu> killer instincts tutorials are also rly good
[1:44:56] <+ChansonNoire> for baiken in the corner its 5D6 > 6HS > 6HS > Tatami > jS > jD > AD jS > jD > 5HS > Kuchinashi... but it wont work on all the characters Keepo
[1:44:56] <+Jeebus4> is that vinesauce???
[1:45:05] <NumberTooBig> but unist does give you a character's nuetral, starter mixups, etc
[1:45:08] <mtlwolf_> there were never a tutorial that teaches you what your character does in sf games
[1:45:08] <Jetsfantasy> I'd argue SF doesn't teach you more about character types than GG or other games
[1:45:11] <Kaendorth> some characters do have some trials that are setups
[1:45:22] <mtlwolf_> its mostly combo missions + your character has this this and this
[1:45:27] <MTLxSpider> yeah
[1:45:34] <+TeddybearTicket> @labanderox Guilty Gear has tutorials that show you what special moves characters are most likely to do, SF barely has a tuturial
[1:45:55] <MTLxSpider> SF has a tutorial on how to be eatsport.
[1:46:00] <MTLxSpider> by turning on Ads
[1:46:05] <labanderox> there's a segment in SFV where they show you specific moves and tell you what they're used for, i feel like that should be in more FGs
[1:46:20] <mtlwolf_> ^^ thats present in most anime games to
[1:46:23] <UnknownGerm> I wonder if other fighting games are going to follow suit with Mortal Kombat and show frame data on everything
[1:46:30] <gnarly_memes_bro> the tutorials for this game are phenomenal, i can get much more don in GG than any street fighter game. at least I feel like i get closer to competent play in GG than any other 2d fighter
[1:46:30] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:46:40] <Kaendorth> true, there's even how to deal with certain moves in this game
[1:46:40] <@Menitta> Yeah dont worry about lobbies. Theyre all friggin empty
[1:46:42] <MTLxSpider> BBTAG combo trials also shows what are your special and anti air and properties
[1:46:43] <gnarly_memes_bro> thats totally me tho
[1:46:52] <Idon__> Wow, it's fucking nothing
[1:47:02] <@Menitta> except like....2 in tokyo
[1:47:04] <mtlwolf_> sfv lacks variety in this regard. tutorials will be "do this move to do this" whereas anime games will have "in this situation do this if the opponent is blocking" type of tutorials
[1:47:18] <labanderox> arent the global lobbies bad?
[1:47:50] <mtlwolf_> alex please
[1:47:53] <mtlwolf_> LUL

[1:59:43] <@Menitta> I wanna learn Slayer. He looks rad
[1:59:49] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 2 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 8oz (240mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[1:59:56] <+NPCMatro> may best character
[1:59:59] <@Menitta> @Stay_Hydrated_Bot Bless
[2:00:11] <GenericSoda> always bet on bedman
[2:00:12] <Kaendorth> @Menitta he's sick and not very execution heavy if you ask me
[2:00:12] <+TeddybearTicket> @Menitta Slayer does alot of damage with his Mappa Punch
[2:00:22] <+dawsfloss> dont tell me how to live hydrated bot
[2:00:36] <GenericSoda> pile bunker is basically pau's death fist

[2:06:40] <GenericSoda> what a conundrum
[2:07:06] <+TeddybearTicket> But you can't blitz it every time
[2:07:07] <labanderox> @jinking79 yeah since its so rare for people to both be at that life compared to tekken

[2:11:49] <+DingusMcFadden> Drink the Bang-Juice, Woolie!
[2:11:50] <CynicalKirby> Funny how the new ninja in GG ends up playing like Bang

[2:12:09] <GenericSoda> i only follow gg and castlevania lore

[2:12:38] <+PenmanLupine> Kreygasm
[2:12:39] <ShreddingPixels> Man that will never stop being weird.
[2:12:41] <ManOfReason> STOP
[2:12:44] <ShreddingPixels> Even if she is a Gear.
[2:12:45] <GenericSoda> she was 3 in xx, 8 in overture, and 13 in xrd
[2:12:46] <gustavozxd> so yeah Ky impregnated a 3 year old LUL
[2:12:47] <gnarly_memes_bro> dizzy is a loaded quetion
[2:12:49] <ManOfReason> BEFORe the FBI comes
[2:12:55] <weissguard> ~Moshi Moshi~ FBI Desu~
[2:12:57] <GenericSoda> I think?
[2:13:02] <spec__> @gustavozxd so Ky is the same as any other politician or king
[2:13:04] <RVMSpeedWagon> Best prez. Chipp or funny valentine
[2:13:05] <+goose_attack_almanac> Dizzy passes the Harkness test
[2:13:10] <GenericSoda> i think 7?
[2:13:18] <TatariX> Dizzy's 7 now
[2:13:19] <%DRAGUN_Xrd> 5 or 7?
[2:13:20] <chaozagents> Dizzy is about 8 i guess but she is mentally and physically like 20
[2:13:27] <+DingusMcFadden> Funny Valentine. He collects napkins
[2:13:32] <+TeddybearTicket> Ky married a 3 yr old?
[2:13:35] <+DingusMcFadden> HArdcore
[2:13:35] <VJdarkworld> Vaati pls explain
[2:13:36] <Kaendorth> i'm afraid to ask how old ramlethal is
[2:13:36] <GenericSoda> Dizzy is 8
[2:13:37] <NeroInfinite> yes
[2:13:40] <spec__> Overture is definitely canon
[2:13:42] <GenericSoda> got mixed up
[2:13:42] <+og_lunchbox> theres some dumb bullshit about how Sin ages fast because of his mom i think
[2:13:45] <jubejube56> so Ky is a lolicon?
[2:13:46] <+geobuster> Dizzy was the final boss of X1
[2:13:47] <gnarly_memes_bro> fun fact dizzy is my mom i legally adopted myself to her
[2:13:48] <%Solidnick18> um
[2:13:50] <+Koover> how many is that in gear years
[2:13:58] <SnowCrane> Yes, officer, this streamer right here.
[2:13:59] <spec__> @Kaendorth i dont even think ram is a year old lmao
[2:13:59] <NeroInfinite> ...
[2:14:00] <@Menitta> woolieOMG
[2:14:02] <ShreddingPixels> "Only a Bonus"
[2:14:03] <gustavozxd> different laws probably
[2:14:04] <wolvenelf> Oh no._.
[2:14:07] <nmaten> Rt partner everybody
[2:14:08] <+PenmanLupine> Everythings ok as long as they aren't "human"
[2:14:09] <GenericSoda> Dizzy is mentally and physically an adult, it's more tasteful than other stuff
[2:14:11] <Kaendorth> @spec__ shit
[2:14:11] <ManOfReason> my mind is telling me no, my booodddy is telling me yes
[2:14:17] <spec__> Gears arent humans tho so its fine they pass the harkness test
[2:14:18] <GenericSoda> Dizzy is 8
[2:14:19] <@Solidus_113> Where's Bridget
[2:14:19] <DarkVinceX> I want Paradigm as a playable character
[2:14:21] <GoldeNOVA> M-Muther
[2:14:24] <LoadingFWANK> sin is like 4 right?
[2:14:26] <GenericSoda> Sin is 5
[2:14:27] <+plzdodge> I'm trying to make anime shading on my characters in my video game and holy shit is it the hardest thing ever, I pray to ArcSys everyday for their hardwork
[2:14:30] <Tajy_Venom> I think Sin is like 5
[2:14:30] <gustavozxd> who knows maybe it's actually illegal and Ky is a criminal there too LUL
[2:14:30] <prime_name> So if her physical age was higher, this wouldn't be an issue?
[2:14:32] <AComptonG> isn't sin half gear
[2:14:37] <mtlwolf_> you have to considered this: Ky impregnate dizzy while there was an angel and a demon looking at them @WoolieVersus
[2:14:40] <%jinking79> Sin 5+
[2:14:42] <AComptonG> so he like wasn't born normally
[2:14:44] <gnarly_memes_bro> Age in years seems to mean nothing in GG, does it?
[2:14:46] <Quadroxin> Sin is Nero
[2:14:47] <%DRAGUN_Xrd> Sin is 5
[2:14:49] <mistersups> Ky is actually part Gear I think?
[2:14:51] <+DingusMcFadden> Dot from Reboot prolly wan't even a year old, @WoolieVersus . Don't act like you ain't thirsty
[2:14:53] <+Disraged> what if dizzy was the same age but was ara ara
[2:14:53] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:14:53] <GenericSoda> Gears hatch from eggs
[2:14:58] <+TeddybearTicket> Ky: If she is old enough to pee she is old enough for me
[2:14:59] <%zeroarturia> Also for anybody interested in the game Fanatical is having limited sale for Xrd sign and Rev2 for 13.49
[2:15:03] <jubejube56> Dizzy is the opposite of the 1000 year old loli trope
[2:15:03] <@Solidus_113> J
[2:15:06] <spec__> Ky caught being a Gear like an STD lmao
[2:15:06] <s_snowball> why do their ages matter if they don't age/mature the same as humans
[2:15:07] <RVMSpeedWagon> Wait gears are a type of humanoid? I thought they where all like giant monsters ?
[2:15:07] <ShreddingPixels> J
[2:15:12] <+HiroTSK5> Gear years are weird since I think Sol's like 100+
[2:15:12] <Laironx3> Potemkin with blue colors is going to drop in Woolie's stream
[2:15:14] <@Menitta> J
[2:15:21] <VJdarkworld> Dizzy is benjamin button?
[2:15:23] <%zeroarturia> But Woolie they pass the Harkness test
[2:15:32] <%Wool> welp, there goes my first time playing GG
[2:15:38] <%shmupdogjoe> I think Gears are more like Generator Gawl/Soul Taker style doom weapons
[2:15:38] <%Wool> not too bad
[2:15:39] <Quadroxin> Sol's over 200
[2:15:41] <MTLxSpider> atleast you played
[2:15:42] <gustavozxd> Sin is weird to play
[2:15:46] <MTLxSpider> shunaoAaaa
[2:15:48] <ghostravens> @WoolieVersus what are your favorite songs from this game's ost?
[2:15:48] <RadShiro> woolie trying to make Gears age correlate with human age FeelsBadMan
[2:15:49] <mtlwolf_> ^ nah
[2:15:51] <gnarly_memes_bro> @Wool you fooled me friendo
[2:15:52] <MTLxSpider> Sin is easy
[2:15:55] <Bloogoose> Oh god Bedman.
[2:15:56] <mtlwolf_> sin has no mixups
[2:15:58] <+Koover> its probably 1 drop
[2:16:02] <ShreddingPixels> I'd play Sin if he didn't have a meat meter.
[2:16:05] <labanderox> gear age is pretty much dog years :x
[2:16:09] <DarkVinceX> OH YES

[2:16:27] <%shmupdogjoe> What is this griefing bullshit music pick
[2:16:28] <@Menitta> I wish Bedman was That Man
[2:16:30] <ShamanKing0811> SourPls
[2:16:30] <+og_lunchbox> If i'm remembering right Sin is born normal but grows super fast so Ky sends him away for a while so people dont freak out that he looks 15 at age 2
[2:16:32] <@Menitta> That Bed Man
[2:16:34] <%ChoculaUltra> just tuned in - who's the guest that looks like Pat but far superior
[2:16:35] <mistersups> BIRTH DAY

[2:16:41] <+PenmanLupine> Last Train Home BibleThump
[2:16:42] <RVMSpeedWagon> What even is bedman?
[2:16:45] <mtlwolf_> anyone hating on this music is getting timed out
[2:16:46] <spec__> love the songs in this game
[2:16:47] <+arilou_lei> A gear is just a a human with Gear DNA. So if your part Gear you are actually all Gear.
[2:16:47] <+DingusMcFadden> Some pillows shit
[2:16:49] <%Solidnick18> birthday train woolieGASM
[2:16:50] <ManOfReason> rolling credits
[2:17:02] <GoldeNOVA> The real fooolk blues
[2:17:05] <ShreddingPixels> Just delete the rest of Xrd's OST. This is the only song you need.
[2:17:08] <wolvenelf> Fricking bedman
[2:17:10] <UnknownGerm> BODIED
[2:17:10] <labanderox> wait you can jump that
[2:17:12] <%shmupdogjoe> Bedman is the first fighting game character for Roujin Z fans!
[2:17:14] <%Solidnick18> goobye birthday train
[2:17:14] <labanderox> i did not know that
[2:17:15] <gustavozxd> I find it frustrating that of all the gg games I've played, I didn't find anyone I was comfortable with, Sol kinda but not that much
[2:17:18] <+Answer_Moose> Oof
[2:17:20] <spec__> bedman players don't even know how bedman works i refuse to believe that GCYoshi has a plan and isn't just hitting buttons
[2:17:42] <gnarly_memes_bro> I personally identify with Bedman the most out of any GG cast member
[2:17:44] <+DingusMcFadden> Also, he is a bed
[2:17:50] <Quadroxin> Gears are designed to be used as weapons so they reach maturity quickly then have slowed age.
[2:17:52] <%Wool> GCYoshi is forever a suffering Bedman
[2:17:53] <Kenny_Riot> 2
[2:17:56] <+arilou_lei> Bedman players have a plan... actually they have alot of plans and they switch between them
[2:18:01] <%jinking79> Sin just 5+ now
[2:18:04] <Kenny_Riot> @shmupdogjoe that's a fuckin' PULL right there
[2:18:08] <+arilou_lei> Bedman is just all a bunch of plans for a bunch of situations
[2:18:09] <chaozagents> Hoping we get to see some Jack-O action here
[2:18:10] <+geobuster> Bedman is a marvel character, he calls himself for assists
[2:18:16] <ShreddingPixels> I've never felt comfortable fighting a Bedman. He's just so weird.
[2:18:17] <+arilou_lei> and there is a way out it's just hard to figure out.
[2:18:18] <%Solidnick18> wow
[2:18:22] <spec__> ok so dizzy is like 20 at this point idk
[2:18:38] <mtlwolf_> ^ physically Kappa
[2:18:45] <GenericSoda> thanks for the game! dizzy is 8
[2:18:46] <%Solidnick18> lol
[2:18:47] <gnarly_memes_bro> age in GG is a mindset, not a number
[2:18:59] <NumberTooBig> wasnt Dizzy 8, and Sin 5ish, both are at the peak age of 19 presumably
[2:19:02] <chaozagents> But if Sin is 15 then Dizzy has to be older
[2:19:02] <nmaten> assuming someones 15+3 gets you in jail
[2:19:03] <ManOfReason> thats a book
[2:19:05] <spec__> I didn't care for the xrd dub, but I loved bedman's dubbed voice for the winquotes
[2:19:11] <+og_lunchbox> the monologue everywhere system
[2:19:11] <NeroInfinite> fucking hell for a bed ridden man he talks a lot
[2:19:13] <MTLxSpider> dizzy is a grandma
[2:19:16] <+PenmanLupine> Blue Water Blue Sky Kreygasm
[2:19:17] <labanderox> ironically, answer does not talk at all when he fights
[2:19:19] <@Menitta> I'm getting back in line
[2:19:21] <labanderox> *bedman
[2:19:21] <@Menitta> fuck it
[2:19:22] <%linkwolf4> that makes it WOOOORSE @gnarly_memes_bro
[2:19:25] <ShreddingPixels> Slayer bois wtfMiner
[2:19:26] <mtlwolf_> ye dizzy is old
[2:19:26] <%shmupdogjoe> Everyone talks about whether having Dizzy for a wife is creepy due to age, but I just picture staring int Necro's cold dead eyes while consumating that marriage
[2:19:36] <GenericSoda> i'm glad everybody appreciated birthday train
[2:19:48] <+Kilik_> Baiken <3
[2:19:50] <+og_lunchbox> Edgey Baiken
[2:19:56] <gnarly_memes_bro> @linkwolf4 thats also just a mindset WutFace WutFace
[2:19:56] <spec__> the real weirdness is ABA's relationship with that Key she's grinding on
[2:20:03] <UnknownGerm> ^
[2:20:22] <%Solidnick18> SourPls
[2:20:28] <%DRAGUN_Xrd> in the english dub in SIGN I think they do it too
[2:20:30] <spec__> May's announcer voice is good she can't pronounce Ramlethal at all
[2:20:30] <DarkVinceX> I don't remember this song
[2:20:37] <chaozagents> We also have Jack-O who's the game states is not born yet
[2:20:37] <GenericSoda> ABA has a healthy relationship with a key who has no say in being dragged around, truer love i've never seen
[2:20:43] <%linkwolf4> baiken embracing her inner shadow the hedgehog

[2:33:11] <%Gogogolem> Gogogolem subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 5 month streak! Its time for your monthly bad joke. Its not a communist joke .... unless everyoen gets it.
[2:33:12] <DarkVinceX> The Original
[2:33:13] <ShreddingPixels> Raven wtfGasm
[2:33:15] <spec__> I really wanna see Slayer vs Sol without holding back in the story
[2:33:17] <gustavozxd> those nudealities though
[2:33:18] <NumberTooBig> The Original, nice
[2:33:18] <+VektorTroika> This is the reason why there should and should not be a season 2
[2:33:22] <mtlwolf_> hey yo raven got nerf
[2:33:24] <mtlwolf_> stop this brice
[2:33:25] <NeroInfinite> nobody plays Epic 7 tho'
[2:33:32] <spec__> I like Raven because I like Jedah but he is dumb as fuck lmao
[2:33:39] <ShreddingPixels> ^
[2:33:41] <mistersups> Fly (Get high) Dive (Burn out)
[2:33:46] <gnarly_memes_bro> @WoolieVersus Fighterpedia HD is my first time seeing most of them, skullgirls had me in tears
[2:33:57] <NeroInfinite> ELphet is in Girl's Frontline alongside Noel
[2:34:03] <+TheIntellectional> not tekken lol
[2:34:08] <GenericSoda> the launch party is STILL going
[2:34:13] <+TheIntellectional> the old characters get new moves every game
[2:34:15] <DarkVinceX> it never stopped
[2:34:21] <mistersups> Don't lose your wings Even if it turns to ash
[2:34:24] <chaozagents> Do you think That Man and Aria will be playable in the next GG?
[2:34:26] <+Koover> Retro Fitting old characters probably isn't easy either
[2:34:34] <+VektorTroika> MOBAge in a nutshell
[2:34:35] <NumberTooBig> @chaozagents yes and yes
[2:34:36] <DarkVinceX> the party should end in... 2 weeks
[2:34:37] <%shmupdogjoe> That Man will never be playable
[2:34:37] <GenericSoda> i think That Man eill
[2:34:38] <ShreddingPixels> Raven's theme got me into GG
[2:34:42] <spec__> Frequent updates are shit, annual is best
[2:34:47] <spec__> barring shit like infinites
[2:34:50] <labanderox> speaking of which, will there ever be skullgilrs GIFG? @WoolieVersus
[2:34:58] <jubejube56> If That Man turns around and wields a keyblade that would be the most out there crossover ever
[2:35:07] <gustavozxd> balance updates coming out too fast is awful
[2:35:12] <NumberTooBig> @labanderox only if they can make it a Cryme Time Kappa
[2:35:21] <GenericSoda> @jubejube56 he uses a quill and a book in Vastedge
[2:35:22] <gnarly_memes_bro> @jubejube56 you now have my attention, sir
[2:35:24] <+HiroTSK5> Going by what happened at the end of Rev's story I think That Man is going to be playable in the next game
[2:35:33] <%wolfofsound> wolfofsound subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! Yo punch dad I want to add my congrats to the RT colab you guys deserve it. That said do you think streaming a game with a loli ship is the best move? LUL
[2:35:41] <%shmupdogjoe> I don't want That Man to have a keyblade because that's ABA's thing
[2:35:42] <gustavozxd> "oh I'm ok at the game now oh wait, new update now I suck :) "

[2:36:43] <@Menitta> lmao
[2:36:52] <gnarly_memes_bro> wait i'm not inoculated to the lore, are keyblades actually a thing in GG or are we just memeing?
[2:36:56] <%wolfofsound> god I love this soundtrack
[2:36:58] <NeroInfinite> JUDGEMENT NUT
[2:36:59] <spec__> Dizzy's old theme is so fucking good
[2:37:06] <DarkVinceX> @gnarly_memes_bro Meming
[2:37:11] <NumberTooBig> @gnarly_memes_bro ABA weields a giant Key
[2:37:12] <ShreddingPixels> ABA is a character with a huge key though
[2:37:21] <KitsuneManami> WHERE ARE THE LYRICS
[2:37:23] <MTLxSpider> ABA is sora
[2:37:27] <DarkVinceX> @gnarly_memes_bro Aside from ABA with Paracelsus
[2:37:28] <KitsuneManami> Dizzy's theme is 1000x better with Lyrics
[2:37:31] <NeroInfinite> GET INTO ROCK

[2:38:40] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @weissguard
[2:38:42] <@Solidus_113> it's been 4 years
[2:38:45] <GenericSoda> @darkvincex DANGER TIME DID NOTHING WRONG
[2:38:48] <@Menitta> 2*
[2:38:54] <%Wool> how about that Persona 5 Scramble though
[2:39:02] <%Solidnick18> daisuke is working on something right now for this i think
[2:39:10] <gnarly_memes_bro> its not what i wanted but i'll take it with a grin anyway
[2:39:14] <DarkVinceX> @GenericSoda IT DID EVERYTHING WRONG
[2:39:16] <%linkwolf4> speaking of, time for the long ass wait for DMC 5 SE
[2:39:17] <+donevan42> I really enjoyed playing persona 5, its the first persona game i played. feeling up to play another jrpg, you guys think i should try playing persona 3 or 4.femC seems cool but not sure if ill enjoy a game that old( you can only control your character and not the whole party?)
[2:39:18] <ShreddingPixels> Delet PRC pls
[2:39:22] <gustavozxd> 3 years if you're in Japan
[2:39:28] <jubejube56> I always hate how Atlas always locks best girl behind a 3 year wait
[2:39:33] <DarkVinceX> @GenericSoda DANGER TIME IS THE GRIFFITH OF XRD
[2:39:45] <GenericSoda> how many tournaments has danger time ruined? none, thats how many
[2:40:01] <@Menitta> How was Danger Time bad?
[2:40:01] <GenericSoda> its fine
[2:40:15] <chaozagents> When the next GG comes out what characters do you want to come back?
[2:40:17] <gnarly_memes_bro> @donevan42 definitely give p3p a try, emulators are easy to find. i bounced off of it but ended up enjoying p4 immensely, but im still glad i gave p3 a shot
[2:40:18] <MTLxSpider> danger time is random
[2:40:19] <ShreddingPixels> Danger Time is hilarious.
[2:40:24] <@Menitta> oh its RANDOM?!
[2:40:30] <ShreddingPixels> But I wouldn't shed a tear if its gone.
[2:40:31] <DarkVinceX> it's random
[2:40:32] <@Menitta> Jesus....
[2:40:33] <gustavozxd> danger time is random?
[2:40:34] <jubejube56> never heard of a random mechanic in GG
[2:40:40] <GenericSoda> it is but its still fine
[2:40:45] <%DRAGUN_Xrd> isn't when two HS' clash?
[2:40:51] <%linkwolf4> I for one, am quite excited for Persona Musou
[2:40:51] <+Cthulos> Ramlethal needs to come back
[2:40:59] <%shmupdogjoe> danger time is a random chance when any attacks clash
[2:41:04] <%shmupdogjoe> but only once per round
[2:41:05] <ShreddingPixels> SourPls
[2:41:06] <+VektorTroika> Moon Goodguy
[2:41:06] <%shmupdogjoe> max
[2:41:09] <LoadingFWANK> fauat has a kinda random mechanic
[2:41:10] <labanderox> aw shit dustloop time
[2:41:15] <DarkVinceX> YES, THIS SONG
[2:41:22] <LoadingFWANK> faust*
[2:41:30] <gustavozxd> didn't know it was random, that's funny
[2:41:43] <labanderox> this one's safe intoxication right?
[2:41:44] <spec__> i love this song
[2:41:54] <GenericSoda> sky should be high
[2:41:55] <MTLxSpider> oh sht its Nachos

[2:42:01] <%DRAGUN_Xrd> @labanderox Skies Should be High
[2:42:01] <ShreddingPixels> SKYYYY should be HIGH SourPls
[2:42:03] <MTLxSpider> also a local player
[2:42:04] <%wolfofsound> this soundtrack fucks
[2:42:07] <KitsuneManami> yay disrespectful show offs lol
[2:42:22] <%DRAGUN_Xrd> that's a good Baiken color
[2:42:24] <jubejube56> @wolfofsound yes but it never had kids
[2:42:28] <KitsuneManami> cotton candy baiken
[2:42:28] <gnarly_memes_bro> The detail that will make or break P5S is the number of playable characters. If there aren't legacy characters that roster just won't be big enough IMO
[2:42:39] <KitsuneManami> if she looked in the Mirror, she'd kill herself
[2:42:40] <%wolfofsound> @jubejube56 what are you talking about there are kids on the ship Kappa
[2:42:49] <calamarvelous> I really like Pastel Baiken...
[2:42:55] <+donevan42> @gnarly_memes_bro thanks for reply ill give it a shot, is there a best version of p3p i should go for?
[2:43:11] <+Personified134> what was it tasty steve said about counterhit fafnir making you a man

[2:44:00] <ShreddingPixels> I'm convinced that not even Sol players know what happens during Dragon Install.
[2:44:01] <%linkwolf4> Shout out to putting on the ignorance juice
[2:44:06] <GenericSoda> NO DONT
[2:44:08] <spec__> Starting from XRD and being used to XRD dragon install and going to an older GG and seeing its version of dragon install is the most disappointing thing
[2:44:16] <+Personified134> GET DOWN TO ROCK
[2:44:17] <ShreddingPixels> Yooo old El.

[2:44:39] <+Personified134> the wife has a LOT of guns
[2:44:44] <gnarly_memes_bro> @donevan42 not that i'm aware, i use PPSSPP for psp emulation, any old ISO file for p3p should be just fine
[2:44:44] <NeroInfinite> She has MANY guns
[2:44:45] <jubejube56> @linkwolf4 shotgun wedding?
[2:44:47] <spec__> @jinking79 did you get an hdtv recently :p

[2:45:23] <NumberTooBig> you know what, shouldve put a 4Head there
[2:45:42] <kuningaz45> But it isn't even on youtube though
[2:45:47] <kuningaz45> what the fuck is going on
[2:45:59] <GenericSoda> @kuningaz45 what, yes it is
[2:46:03] <+HiroTSK5> You can get some of the music included in the steam versions. They go on sale pretty often.
[2:46:05] <NumberTooBig> @kuningaz45 it is, Tempest Nova even has downloads to it
[2:46:11] <GenericSoda> ormaybe ita on soundclod
[2:46:23] <kuningaz45> that's SIGN, not Rec

[2:47:06] <jubejube56> dammit menitta tempting me with the Axl avatar
[2:47:11] <jubejube56> never see him on stream
[2:47:13] <spec__> lmao true. shoutouts to ishiwatari's homoerotic art
[2:47:18] <%Hammerknife> i just realized this lobby is like a global lobby. there's nobody playing except woolie and followers, which is kind of asd
[2:47:27] <%linkwolf4> I love how elphelt is so desperate to litterally fuck ANYTHING
[2:47:49] <$KnivesEve> hi yall, looks like i havent missed the stream
[2:47:51] <NumberTooBig> @Hammerknife big lobbies are never used, player match is where its at
[2:47:53] <GenericSoda> she just wants to get married-arried-arried
[2:47:54] <gnarly_memes_bro> @linkwolf4 i find it pretty relatable ResidentSleeper
[2:47:55] <ShreddingPixels> Most people play in the player made rooms now.
[2:47:58] <+Ecchigun> @Hammerknife like every game woolie touches
[2:48:00] <KombatJunkeeTV> this games pretty dead :( the lobbiez are usually ghost town
[2:48:01] <jubejube56> @linkwolf4 isn't it in her programming or something? I forget the plot of xrd but I think they explain it
[2:48:01] <drefizz> Daidoji, Baiken, Juri, my top 3 waifus
[2:48:20] <gustavozxd> still waiting for a PC/PS4 port of p4a :(
[2:48:22] <Suwaiya> go to player room
[2:48:22] <ShreddingPixels> People used to use the big lobies, but then everybody left for Dragon Ball and they never recovered.
[2:48:24] <drefizz> Wait I forgot Jack'O
[2:48:33] <+thackattack00> @drefizz Ah, I see you're a man of culture as well
[2:48:34] <Suwaiya> stop looking in the wrong places then call the game dead lol
[2:48:34] <%linkwolf4> @jubejube56 no idea, haven't taken the dive into lore.

[3:31:32] <%Solidnick18> oh
[3:31:34] <%shmupdogjoe> Well, @WaitHowDidIGetHere , if you're going to betray me later with a name like that, I will be double-mad
[3:31:41] <MTLxSpider> if you want sin advice dm me
[3:31:49] <%shmupdogjoe> for both the betrayal and then for the misleading name
[3:31:53] <+SlantedSped> they're playing on ps4 right?
[3:32:10] <chaozagents> @SlantedSped yes but they are wrapping up soon
[3:32:12] <mistermaybe> Yeh
[3:32:21] <gnarly_memes_bro> @SlantedSped yea but i think they're changing to Power rangers soon
[3:32:38] <+SlantedSped> i mean that's fine i play on pc anyway lol
[3:32:38] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:32:41] <mtlwolf_> for how much time did they play GG ? 2 hours ?
[3:32:41] <+SlantedSped> thank you though
[3:32:48] <MTLxSpider> i got crossuped by burst wow
[3:32:48] <%shmupdogjoe> Does the Power Rangers game have the theme song? I feel like this stream should just continue with the buttrock if it possibly can
[3:32:51] <gnarly_memes_bro> !uptime
[3:32:52] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 32 minutes
[3:32:58] <mtlwolf_> nice
[3:32:59] <chaozagents> Seeing this makes me want to get back in and work on my Jack-O some more
[3:33:04] <+SlantedSped> the power rangers game has like no music, it's so sad lol
[3:33:16] <%shmupdogjoe> fighting games with no music at all
[3:33:17] <jubejube56> Wait why does Moobot use the triple S from DmC of all things?
[3:33:17] <%shmupdogjoe> what a world
[3:33:26] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> @shmupdogjoe Excuse me, but that appears to be MY knife sticking out of your back. Could I have that back, please?
[3:33:28] <Bloogoose> Battle for the Grid has a budget of like $24 dollars
[3:33:42] <+SlantedSped> it has music, technically
[3:33:45] <gnarly_memes_bro> but damn they stretched that $24 as far as they could
[3:33:55] <%shmupdogjoe> @WaitHowDidIGetHere YOU LIED TO ME VIA YOUR SURNAME?! Well I'm keeping this knife now. When I get out of the hospital you still can't have it back
[3:33:55] <jubejube56> @shmupdogjoe you described smash bros with "environmental noises"
[3:33:56] <+SlantedSped> just the most generic stuff they could get an intern to create in an afternoon though
[3:34:05] <Bloogoose> Play GG, it's a good game.
[3:34:08] <Idon__> alright just got here, waddup stream?
[3:34:11] <+donpatrondx> is this game supported still?

[3:37:50] <%Solidnick18> blue ranger looks nuts
[3:37:51] <Ion_Laser> It's MorphinTime
[3:37:56] <+cherokee2391> i feel like this can only end poorly
[3:37:57] <El_Desperad0> @gnarly_memes_bro yeyeye
[3:38:10] <tmo200> Ya the game is pretty wild
[3:38:12] <gnarly_memes_bro> i am excite

[3:38:26] <+Ecchigun> MorphinTime
[3:38:29] <Ion_Laser> MorphinTime
[3:38:30] <Bloogoose> This game is the epitome of jank
[3:38:30] <%Hammerknife> like why did they make a specifically power rangers game, and not a more general sentai game that had power rangers in it
[3:38:35] <gustavozxd> when are we getting quantum ranger damn it
[3:38:36] <MTLxSpider> yo is this the first we will see brice playing a Versus game?!!?!
[3:38:38] <gnarly_memes_bro> this'll be the first time i watch people actually play it outside of the promotional trailers
[3:38:42] <+HazyCases> Green Ranger mirrors = Dragon flute for days
[3:38:43] <%Solidnick18> woolieWHENS
[3:38:49] <+Dull_Fangs> Oh hey this game

[3:38:57] <+MagickBurritoh> apatHoldon
[3:38:57] <+boomer059> Goldar is op in teh game.
[3:39:01] <Nekros4442> @hammerknife cus getting the rights to Japanese sentai stuff is prob hard
[3:39:02] <NumberTooBig> @Hammerknife Saban thinks he made the genre so Saban's name will be slapped on it god dammit
[3:39:03] <+MagickBurritoh> This is great
[3:39:07] <RVMSpeedWagon> Not even in a match and the Jank is real
[3:39:10] <Bloogoose> WHERES BULK AND SKULL?!
[3:39:16] <antthefool> Is there a tier list across all the power ranger generations?

[3:40:09] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> 🎶Set control to / Outer space, Yeah! / Flying higher than eeeever befo-ore. 🎶
[3:40:20] <Bloogoose> They didn't have the money for R2 configs
[3:40:20] <%jinking79> this game 20$
[3:40:37] <+Dull_Fangs> lets fucking go
[3:40:47] <+MrE_Sauce> now this is the stuff i came to see
[3:40:50] <townzzzzz> manual inputs 4lyfe
[3:40:54] <Zeragoth25> Clap
[3:41:24] <gustavozxd> this game deserves so much more :(
[3:41:24] <+Dull_Fangs> this is what you deserve you macro using heathens
[3:41:28] <+asperger_mode> it has lobbies now?
[3:41:37] <NumberTooBig> @WoolieVersus so, thinking of doing a Fightcade special of all the poverty neogeo stuff, on there, like Karnov or Breakers
[3:41:43] <Bloogoose> Blue Range is FreeLC later
[3:41:50] <KitsuneManami> @WoolieVersus SOMEONE do the Dragon Zord Flute song

[3:41:56] <@Solidus_113> SPD
[3:41:57] <Bloogoose> KAT MANX IS RAD
[3:42:13] <RVMSpeedWagon> Oh this looks like a phone game whoof
[3:42:22] <mistersups> Call the Police!
[3:42:23] <zamzoph> No Doggie Cruger FeelsBadMan
[3:42:23] <+Dull_Fangs> seriously why does this guy have a legit ass gun
[3:42:27] <+Dull_Fangs> LMAO
[3:42:33] <gustavozxd> waiting for the Dan Southworth ranger
[3:42:35] <labanderox> so wait a jobber is a playable character?
[3:42:36] <+cherokee2391> i can't tell a what a lot of the different generations here are
[3:42:46] <+Dull_Fangs> this is what you get for only reading Eventscrubs woolie
[3:42:47] <antthefool> Who’s those other weirdos
[3:42:48] <%Hammerknife> i dont remember a gun ranger, and whenever i'm trying to think of the power rangers song i keep getting the power rangers turbo song which is way worse
[3:42:51] <Blurf32> from the comics
[3:42:55] <labanderox> sounds like skullgirls Kappa
[3:42:56] <indigoblooper> there was supposed to be 12 but they rushed to get out before mk11
[3:42:57] <mistersups> 4 characters are coming
[3:42:57] <+cahv123> He's not even a real power ranger its a suit that was developed to look like the mastodon power ranger. He's just a jober.
[3:43:05] <+boomer059> Black ranger has a gun because he's just a grunt guy.
[3:43:05] <Laironx3> this is a very tiny roster
[3:43:06] <Johno_san> @Bloogoose MANX is secretlyfurry bait and im not even mad
[3:43:09] <Bloogoose> This stage looks sooooo bad.
[3:43:09] <indigoblooper> a lot of the characters are from the comics
[3:43:10] <NeroInfinite> skullgirls has more than nine characters
[3:43:13] <+MagickBurritoh> WTF is this game
[3:43:20] <gustavozxd> for a power rangers game it's insanely small
[3:43:22] <%Solidnick18> i seen some shit
[3:43:26] <%Solidnick18> WTF
[3:43:28] <%Solidnick18> guns
[3:43:29] <+zaworldo> Skullgirls looks real weird what is this
[3:43:29] <+MagickBurritoh> GUN
[3:43:30] <labanderox> @NeroInfinite vanilla skullgirls only had 8
[3:43:33] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> That Pink Ranger is the dopest Pink Ranger I've ever seen
[3:43:36] <HoldBtoRun> this game looks like a game
[3:43:36] <antthefool> WHERES WILDFORCE COWARD
[3:43:37] <%wujak> ive seen magna do a block string tod
[3:43:46] <%Hammerknife> he didnt even say anything into his radio. he just sort of mimed at it
[3:43:46] <gnarly_memes_bro> lthis looks like a ps2 game i love it
[3:43:48] <+Dull_Fangs> its a cool little game made with mobile assets
[3:43:49] <townzzzzz> this some jank
[3:43:51] <NerevaRising> Zordon looks like my neighbor...
[3:43:53] <+cherokee2391> how many different variations of power rangers are there anyways
[3:43:56] <+Dull_Fangs> they are going to do this game so wrong
[3:43:59] <tanarath> wait, what is this?
[3:44:01] <@Menitta> oh wow this gamr looks like mvci
[3:44:10] <antthefool> Looks
[3:44:10] <Floofiie> Gimme SPD Shadow Ranger w/ the countdown ticker
[3:44:12] <Bloogoose> It looks better than MVCI
[3:44:12] <jubejube56> lol why was forward throw in a bigger font?
[3:44:13] <antthefool> Like
[3:44:16] <gnarly_memes_bro> @Menitta if it was on ps2, sure
[3:44:25] <+zaworldo> A jobber
[3:44:27] <@Menitta> I mean something about the animations
[3:44:29] <Bloogoose> Its also 1/3 of the price of MVCI
[3:44:32] <NumberTooBig> once again, the game is just as cheapo as the show so it's better that its fun but poverty looking
[3:44:35] <@Menitta> It really reminds me of MVCI
[3:44:36] <%Hammerknife> the horrible lighting makes the models look way worse than they actually are. the lighting is like basic 3d artist's first directional light
[3:44:43] <MainMan_Jonadiah> So I'm guessing they just started, so I'm guessing an infinite will be found in the next 10 minutes
[3:44:46] <gnarly_memes_bro> yea thats fair, but mvci's animations were pretty ps2 if you ask me
[3:44:49] <+VektorTroika> Game's story is based on some kinda comic. Mastodon sentries are generic goons
[3:44:55] <indigoblooper> mvci looked bad but was from a big name company, this is 20 bucks and from a hella smaller company
[3:45:00] <%Fiend95> They
[3:45:00] <@Menitta> I'd say so did 3 but fair
[3:45:02] <Laironx3> Zordon is unimpressed
[3:45:04] <wolvenelf> Ngl this is lookin like a fake game you see in the bg
[3:45:05] <Bloogoose> Goldar's damage is nutty
[3:45:07] <%Hammerknife> the visual effects arent bad. the hitsparks and stuff are fine
[3:45:11] <+Dull_Fangs> @Hammerknife fair to say lighting is make or break for a lot of games graphics these days
[3:45:14] <QaizerArt> MIGHTY this ONE'S FOR YOU MOORPH POWER RAAANGERS
[3:45:20] <+Dull_Fangs> and partly way Ray Tracing is being talked up so much
[3:45:21] <%jinking79> Pink ranger top tier
[3:45:30] <@Menitta> MVCI looks way better than this but its the first thing that popped into my head
[3:45:38] <antthefool> Where is the bow girl from?
[3:45:39] <+SuichiTanaka> The universe most of this is from is one where the Green Ranger turned evil and formed some empire
[3:45:40] <%Hammerknife> @Dull_Fangs oh for sure its absolutely critical, you can have the best textures and highest polys and still look like crap if you dont light properly
[3:45:43] <gnarly_memes_bro> oh yeah when i say it looks like a ps2 game i'm merely referring to the textures and background
[3:45:47] <+Dull_Fangs> see DS2
[3:45:48] <mistersups> It's a counter
[3:45:48] <Johno_san> BeetleBorgs DLC when?
[3:45:52] <RVMSpeedWagon> Oh this is rough on the eyes
[3:45:56] <QaizerArt> The new designs for the rangers look REALLY cool
[3:45:56] <indigoblooper> Tommy Vs Tommy
[3:45:57] <%Hammerknife> this scene right here would look 10x better if there was contrast between foreground and background and the models weren't lit from the front
[3:46:12] <eldragon_1> It's mostly from the comics
[3:46:14] <SomersaultJustice> play the flute dealie
[3:46:15] <antthefool> @johno_san YO SHADOWBORG WILL BODY THIS ROSTER
[3:46:16] <%Hammerknife> but everything has an ambient light glued onto it and a directional light from camera back
[3:46:19] <@Menitta> ha
[3:46:21] <Bloogoose> HIDDEN MISSILES
[3:46:21] <SomersaultJustice> yeeeeeeee
[3:46:22] <NumberTooBig> this and MVCI are similar in that the graphics look lifeless, but this game is 20 bucks for an already cheapo show
[3:46:23] <mistersups> Toot Toot
[3:46:24] <+zaworldo> Y E S
[3:46:27] <gnarly_memes_bro> actually yeah i guess the lighting is really whats making it look weird to me
[3:46:31] <+cherokee2391> i was hype for like 3 seconds
[3:46:33] <Johno_san> @antthefool WHO?
[3:46:33] <NeroInfinite> DO DOD DOOOALOO
[3:46:37] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> @johno_san Fuck that! When’s the VR Troopers coming?
[3:46:44] <Psyramics> > Power Rangers fighting game > Never transitions to Zord vs Zord
[3:46:45] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[3:46:46] <Johno_san> @antthefool SOUNDS COOL THO
[3:46:46] <%Solidnick18> damn
[3:46:50] <%Solidnick18> lol
[3:46:51] <jubejube56> game will get hype in the lab
[3:46:53] <NeroInfinite> So flaccid
[3:46:54] <+Dull_Fangs> That move is legit
[3:46:55] <%shmupdogjoe> wait is the pink ranger just Samsho Mina?
[3:47:01] <Laironx3> toot toot toot
[3:47:05] <Bloogoose> Pink Ranger is Yukari from P4U
[3:47:06] <+asperger_mode> you guys see low tier god rage at this?
[3:47:10] <El_Desperad0> Sentai fighting game when?
[3:47:12] <%Hammerknife> its weird because the lights make it look like shit, but the visual effects are fine and the particles are fine
[3:47:15] <antthefool> @johno_san a beetleborg villain 😭
[3:47:16] <Bloodhit> Can you play as DMC crew in this?
[3:47:24] <+VektorTroika> Goldar'
[3:47:25] <+zaworldo> WHERE'S DANTE
[3:47:26] <MainMan_Jonadiah> "That is a game" sterling review
[3:47:27] <mistersups> This game is fucking Jank and I love it
[3:47:31] <+Dull_Fangs> From what little I've seen flute is legit and gun man has a good exist
[3:47:40] <+Dull_Fangs> assist
[3:47:47] <Laironx3> Zordon looks like Pat but without the beard
[3:47:49] <antthefool> Was Goldar always this big?
[3:47:53] <gnarly_memes_bro> I wish i had a good exist @Dull_Fangs
[3:47:54] <Jack_DT> wtf he has a gun
[3:48:06] <ghostravens> @Laironx3 zordon IS pat
[3:48:08] <+BurkeBigsby> May be a spicy take, but this is more fun to watch than MK11.
[3:48:09] <jaguarkek318> about the same quality the snes game got at the time lol
[3:48:12] <+SuichiTanaka> this is a mass-produced soldier using the Black Ranger's power.
[3:48:13] <SpookyBeef7> I'm probably gonna get heat for saying this, but this looks like a mobile game, not a fighter.
[3:48:22] <%jinking79> base off the power ranger comic with evil Tommy
[3:48:28] <+HiroTSK5> I believe it was a mobile game
[3:48:29] <Bloogoose> I mean it reuses assets from a mobile game
[3:48:35] <%shmupdogjoe> SpookyBeef7, how can you say something so brave yet so true
[3:48:36] <gnarly_memes_bro> @SpookyBeef7 this is a port/rework of a mobile game. so yeah it does
[3:48:36] <Bloogoose> So it kinda is a mobile game.
[3:48:37] <Johno_san> @antthefool I only vaugly remember the evil guy from the movies and some scenes in a cemetery but loving the show!! and that it was weird the minority was copper instead of a precious metal ;-;
[3:48:39] <%Hammerknife> the animation quality is about as good as MK11's
[3:48:41] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> @jack_dt Yeah, it’s from the latest series: “Power Rangers: Real-Ass Guns.”
[3:48:45] <+Dull_Fangs> it sure as hell does not play like a mobile game tho
[3:48:47] <MTLxSpider> @SpookyBeef7 it is a port from a mobile game lol
[3:48:50] <indigoblooper> its made by the people that made the mobile game but the mobile game was way different
[3:49:01] <gnarly_memes_bro> @SpookyBeef7 if i missed the sarcasm sorry im trashed atm
[3:49:02] <+Dull_Fangs> actual marvel heads worked on this
[3:49:12] <+Dull_Fangs> they shilled it at Wednesday Night Fights
[3:49:14] <SomersaultJustice> damage is so high in this game
[3:49:17] <%Hammerknife> there's also a little bit of 'oh only six year olds will buy this game so fuck it why bother'
[3:49:20] <Nameless0100> So how does this game feel?
[3:49:26] <%ChoculaUltra> kinda feel like a cel-shaded look would've help hide the budget limitations. Nonetheless, shit is fire.
[3:49:27] <indigoblooper> this is more of a fighting game its just budget but the team cares and is workin on it a lot
[3:49:30] <Bloogoose> It actually feels fairly good to play
[3:49:30] <+MagickBurritoh> G U N
[3:49:33] <mistersups> Pink's neutral special buffs next arrow attack
[3:49:39] <+Dull_Fangs> also y'all forget all MvC games are jank as fuck
[3:49:41] <indigoblooper> the head of combat design was Cl0ckwork
[3:49:48] <MainMan_Jonadiah> This game's super fun... Jank... But fun
[3:49:48] <+Dull_Fangs> yeah
[3:49:53] <NeroInfinite> what?
[3:50:02] <+BurkeBigsby> A music mod would do wonders.
[3:50:03] <+Dull_Fangs> Cl0ckwork and some other guy I'm forgetting the name of
[3:50:05] <indigoblooper> *Clockw0rk i guess is the correct way to spell it
[3:50:06] <mistersups> It calls the police
[3:50:08] <+MagickBurritoh> Gunman is great
[3:50:10] <Bloogoose> It scratches that Marvel itch, because God knows nothing else is gonna.
[3:50:11] <indigoblooper> Justin Wong helped with testing it too
[3:50:12] <gnarly_memes_bro> @Dull_Fangs i can't speak for everyone here, but when I say "jank" i never say that in a negative way, i love jank
[3:50:14] <SomersaultJustice> for some reason this makes me miss TvC
[3:50:19] <%Hammerknife> @ChoculaUltra get rid of the cam light and drop the ambient light to 10%, put in a directional light straight down and spot lights
[3:50:23] <%jinking79> Squad
[3:50:24] <+MagickBurritoh> YEYEYEYE
[3:50:26] <+Ecchigun> usa
[3:50:26] <indigoblooper> DA SQUAD
[3:50:27] <Bloogoose> GANG GANG
[3:50:28] <eldragon_1> Yeah cel shading would help. Everything looks too plasticky
[3:50:29] <mistersups> CALL THE POLICE
[3:50:29] <%Hammerknife> there's like no shadow at all in the scene which makes it look flat
[3:50:29] <SomersaultJustice> EGRETS GET READY
[3:50:34] <+SuichiTanaka> Straight up Parasoul's super
[3:50:40] <+Dull_Fangs> Bruh that's Dizzy's super
[3:50:45] <+Dull_Fangs> alos yeah Parasoul
[3:50:47] <%Hammerknife> cel shading won't help the lack of lighting ocntrast
[3:50:49] <indigoblooper> @WoolieVersus both assist buttons calls zords
[3:50:51] <antthefool> Mastodon Sentry is legit boi
[3:50:51] <MainMan_Jonadiah> R1+L1 I think is megazords?
[3:50:54] <NumberTooBig> bit of BB Hood too
[3:50:58] <DePhat1> Gun Flame!
[3:51:00] <%jinking79> their a level 3
[3:51:04] <david_yur_favurid> this game is fire!!!
[3:51:06] <+Dull_Fangs> dude no one plays like BB Hood
[3:51:11] <+Dull_Fangs> BB Hood is crazy
[3:51:11] <%ChoculaUltra> @Hammerknife I see what ya mean with the ambient light, makes everything look a bit fuzzy?
[3:51:15] <%shmupdogjoe> I kind of wish they'd gone oldskool Mortal Kombat and had digitized actors to look *really* shitty Sentai show-y, but I dig that that was probably not a thing that cna happen
[3:51:22] <%Solidnick18> oh
[3:51:33] <elrey745> sup, bois
[3:51:38] <%Hammerknife> @ChoculaUltra it makes every surface roughly the same brightness which means there's no contrast between things that should be in shadow and things that arent
[3:51:39] <Johno_san> You know what? these actually kinda look like the toys you'd buy are fighting to me. is that what they're going for?
[3:51:39] <indigoblooper> both assist buttons calls zords
[3:51:49] <+zaworldo> Both assist buttons?
[3:51:52] <+VektorTroika> when you gonna bust out the MEGAZORDS?
[3:51:56] <david_yur_favurid> the game might be a bit jank rn but its about to get a huge update that fixes a lot of things!
[3:52:00] <indigoblooper> can only call em when you're down a character, and it lasts longer with two down
[3:52:02] <antthefool> When’s kamen rider
[3:52:07] <%Hammerknife> it feels like they thought they were making this for mobile. you're supposed to be careful with lighting in mobile because too many lights rape the phone gpu and battery
[3:52:10] <%ChoculaUltra> Beetleborgs and Superhuman Samurai Syber-Squad guest dlc fucking when?!
[3:52:11] <mistersups> Both assists
[3:52:14] <elrey745> i love how they go with their names and not just red ranger
[3:52:21] <%masterfire23> Kat Kreygasm
[3:52:38] <drefizz> I kinda want this game to get an overhaul in the future
[3:52:39] <Bloogoose> SPD EMERGENCY
[3:52:45] <mistersups> Pink's neutral special buffs next arrow attack
[3:52:51] <antthefool> SPD
[3:52:54] <Caliburize> They better make a lot more characters playable in this game
[3:52:58] <Bloogoose> SPD is the shit
[3:53:10] <indigoblooper> they have planned at least a total of 15 characters with the first dlc
[3:53:13] <rabbi2himself> One of the best budget titles I’ve played in a while.
[3:53:13] <+SuichiTanaka> it's weird that it's all from this alternate dark ranger universe but then they just added Deka Swan
[3:53:14] <NumberTooBig> theres a suprising lack of blue rangers here
[3:53:18] <david_yur_favurid> everyone buy the game now!
[3:53:18] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @antthefool
[3:53:18] <indigoblooper> and more in the future maybe
[3:53:19] <%masterfire23> where is doggy Kruger
[3:53:21] <gnarly_memes_bro> i'm not buying this game until Ivan Ooze is playable
[3:53:25] <Bloogoose> Blue Ranger is FreeLC later
[3:53:28] <+Dull_Fangs> damn woolie is giving this game no mercy
[3:53:29] <tmo200> Do they know about the tag switch when uSing assist
[3:53:36] <%Hammerknife> see, this stage makes the game actually look much better b/c of the lighting
[3:53:38] <stoneString> the magna defender was the hypest shit
[3:53:38] <eldragon_1> I've never actually read the comics, but Drakkon is a pretty cool design
[3:53:43] <Zeragoth25> is yellow ranger a bloodborne character???
[3:53:44] <mistersups> Red has a focus attack
[3:53:45] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:53:46] <+MagickBurritoh> PK fire
[3:53:50] <gustavozxd> I'm pretty sure this is a completely different game from the mobile game
[3:53:53] <+Jhylla81> I hope Abarekiller/Trent will be playable
[3:53:58] <drefizz> I want Noah from mega force/ super mega force, hes honestly my favorite ranger who isnt tommy
[3:54:02] <Caliburize> Drakkon really looks like someone's edgy OC though
[3:54:03] <HoldBtoRun> !MOTIVATED
[3:54:03] <@Moobot> 319 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[3:54:04] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> !motivated
[3:54:06] <+VektorTroika> Jason's got stuff, but an "Eeyah!" bark isn't one of them
[3:54:07] <+Dull_Fangs> yo wall bounces
[3:54:11] <Bloogoose> White Dino Ranger and Quantam Ranger are necessary
[3:54:17] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> !MOTIVATED
[3:54:30] <+Jhylla81> I love playing as Mammoth Sentry
[3:54:31] <indigoblooper> one DLC character got datamined: Zeo Gold
[3:54:32] <%Hammerknife> his sword just turns into a gun?
[3:54:46] <+Dull_Fangs> white's assist looks like ass
[3:54:50] <eldragon_1> The edgy OC'ness is it's charm lol
[3:54:52] <antthefool> I hope they get the dog guy from SPD
[3:54:58] <drefizz> aaaah
[3:55:03] <+zaworldo> So we'll never see those zords chat, because this game be jank
[3:55:08] <NumberTooBig> anyone think the samurai power rangers would appear, those designs are sick.
[3:55:09] <gnarly_memes_bro> i need Ivan OOze as a playable character
[3:55:11] <elrey745> @Hammerknife its a sentai classic
[3:55:12] <+Dull_Fangs> or IDK could you use it as a pressure extender/frame trap
[3:55:14] <labanderox> aaah
[3:55:14] <+Ecchigun> pink ranger is real
[3:55:16] <%ChoculaUltra> yooo, they need at least one of the Psycho Rangers from Space. The villain side of the roster needs some more bodies.
[3:55:22] <HoldBtoRun> sipsipGasm aaAHH
[3:55:31] <+Jhylla81> I really don't get DekaSwan/Kat in this. was she in the comic a lot?
[3:55:34] <antthefool> WHENS chrome bby
[3:55:38] <+cherokee2391> what villans would be good in this game anyways?
[3:55:38] <+zaworldo> Y E S
[3:55:39] <SomersaultJustice> PANDORA
[3:55:41] <gnarly_memes_bro> i think it realistic to expect at least one character to rep each iteration of power rangers
[3:55:43] <Bloogoose> GIANT MAN
[3:55:44] <+zaworldo> IT'S HAPPENING
[3:55:52] <+Dull_Fangs> Does marvel have THIS
[3:55:55] <+Jhylla81> I believe Ecliptor from in space is dlc
[3:55:57] <%Solidnick18> wtf
[3:55:57] <Caliburize> They better put in Ecliptor or Dark Specter
[3:55:58] <SomersaultJustice> REALITY STONE
[3:56:05] <stoneString> get that edgy dude from time patrol. hes one of the few villains that actually did something
[3:56:06] <%ChoculaUltra> holy shit its just the Megazord stabbing at the ground? that's metal.
[3:56:09] <drefizz> who was the ranger in SPD who can rev his morpher?
[3:56:10] <david_yur_favurid> zords have 3 different attacks
[3:56:12] <Bloogoose> Its so cheap.
[3:56:15] <haisho> DORIRU
[3:56:17] <Johno_san> EVERY GANGSTER TIL dragon zord shows up
[3:56:17] <gnarly_memes_bro> i will never rest until i get Ivan Ooze
[3:56:20] <elrey745> @drefizz omega?
[3:56:24] <Caliburize> The Omega Ranger @drefizz
[3:56:25] <drefizz> yeah Omega
[3:56:27] <antthefool> Yoooooooooooooooo
[3:56:30] <+Dull_Fangs> #gamechanger
[3:56:35] <drefizz> I want omega and Noah
[3:56:36] <+CarlosEoM> Gokai PogChamp
[3:56:37] <+cherokee2391> why cant it just be a tag game but when one side loses it swaps into a mechazord fight
[3:56:38] <NumberTooBig> you know what, this is a tag game, they can add Deker to sneak MvC3 Vergil in there Kappa
[3:56:38] <SpookyBeef7> Why so few voice lines?
[3:56:42] <MainMan_Jonadiah> I'm a simple man, I just need Lord Zed
[3:56:46] <Bloogoose> Trini is FreeLC later AND SHES A GRAPPLER
[3:56:48] <indigoblooper> It's a budget-ass game
[3:56:48] <david_yur_favurid> it's not cheap at all haha they are easy to defend against if u practice
[3:56:55] <Caliburize> Ivan Ooze sadly is highly unlikely, since he's still under Saban's name
[3:56:58] <antthefool> The red ranger looks baaad
[3:56:58] <%Jarellephant> best megazords?
[3:57:10] <Caliburize> Shogun megazord is fucking great
[3:57:12] <gnarly_memes_bro> I know, but he's my pipe-dream pick
[3:57:14] <rabbi2himself> This game is jank yet super fun
[3:57:20] <elrey745> Thunder Megazord
[3:57:20] <SomersaultJustice> genocide cutter!
[3:57:20] <+zaworldo> iNFINITE FOUND?
[3:57:22] <david_yur_favurid> red ranger is actually really good. just gotta know how to use him
[3:57:27] <+Dull_Fangs> White's just Seth from Unist with that telaport shit
[3:57:27] <Octopimp> yo how is this game?
[3:57:28] <QaizerArt> Trini BETTER get in the game at some point. She's the only original ranger that's not with us anymore.
[3:57:43] <QaizerArt> Yo, s'Octopimp. Love your voicework, man.
[3:57:43] <+Jhylla81> my dream pick is Black Condor but that's insanely impossible
[3:57:44] <Caliburize> She is, but under one of her comic suits
[3:57:47] <elrey745> @Octopimp sup, pimp
[3:57:52] <@Menitta> this does look kinda fun
[3:57:54] <+Dull_Fangs> hey Octo
[3:57:59] <NeroInfinite> IT's fun but janky
[3:58:01] <Bloogoose> It honestly is really fun to play
[3:58:05] <drefizz> man imagine this game having a capcom budget
[3:58:08] <david_yur_favurid> @octopimp game is really awesome tbh
[3:58:10] <HoldBtoRun> this looks kinda fun actually
[3:58:14] <eldragon_1> I think the Gokaigers (pirates) are my favorite designs
[3:58:19] <%linkwolf4> I've heard this game is jank in the best way
[3:58:21] <+Jhylla81> Trini is free dlc in black dragon armor from the comics
[3:58:22] <Psyramics> supers could use more impact
[3:58:25] <weissguard> Oh hey, it's Yukari's side gig. Kappa
[3:58:32] <mistersups> Magna Defender doesn't actually cock the gun
[3:58:41] <NeroInfinite> Imagine the guy behind Powerrangers not having a stick up his ass about copyrights
[3:58:47] <elrey745> missed opportunity for gokaiyellow to not transform into obscure rangers
[3:58:47] <drefizz> this game could use a visual overhaul in general but its still a cool game
[3:58:49] <NeroInfinite> Saban
[3:58:49] <SomersaultJustice> can you snapback in this game?
[3:58:58] <rabbi2himself> I bought this after watching Maximilian Dood’s stream and seeing how much fun he was having. Great buy for the price.
[3:58:59] <QaizerArt> Saban's an asspain, def, @NeroInfinite
[3:58:59] <Bloogoose> I think you can
[3:59:05] <%linkwolf4> yo CAT RANGER BABY
[3:59:11] <pillowwasp> Power rangers is just a ripoff of Spider-Man
[3:59:25] <tmo200> You can snapback
[3:59:27] <drefizz> LUL
[3:59:29] <antthefool> Yo that damage
[3:59:32] <elrey745> @pillowwasp accurate
[3:59:34] <SomersaultJustice> I like the catgirl
[3:59:42] <gnarly_memes_bro> they should just make saban a playable character and he remove's your license to play the game LUL
[3:59:45] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Pink ranger does her super: completely invincible. Kat Manx does her super: shot in the face
[3:59:47] <drefizz> Triple fancy!
[3:59:50] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 4 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 16oz (480mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[3:59:52] <+Jhylla81> Leopardon for megazord
[4:00:00] <eldragon_1> You mean Supaida-man
[4:00:08] <+attackofthesage> Looking forward to the PC release of this game. Probably gonna be a day 1 purchase for me
[4:00:13] <+SlantedSped> he means emissary of hell
[4:00:13] <elrey745> gg
[4:00:24] <+zaworldo> r a w S U P E R
[4:00:25] <+zaworldo> Y E S
[4:00:27] <%shmupdogjoe> I like how this game is finally letting you do what I think we were all thinking back in the day. "Why not just use the damn zord to step on human-sized enemies"
[4:00:27] <gustavozxd> Saban is just the personification of "I made this :) "
[4:00:30] <MTLxSpider> everyone is amane
[4:00:34] <SomersaultJustice> get justin wong on the phone, tell him to buff that cat super
[4:00:36] <drefizz> @attackofthesage a graphic overhaul mod on pc octoNut2 octoNut1

[4:01:01] <+MagickBurritoh> UNFLAPPABLE
[4:01:07] <Ion_Laser> :D
[4:01:07] <+attackofthesage> @drefizz so you say but mvci didn’t get much similar to that worth installing :(
[4:01:07] <gnarly_memes_bro> its LORE TIME
[4:01:11] <Floofiie> Yo bro don't disrespect my power rangers
[4:01:12] <NeroInfinite> UNFLAPPABLE
[4:01:13] <Caliburize> This game, while it looks fun, really needs to be worked on longer
[4:01:14] <+Dull_Fangs> whatever this game is more alive then Rev 2 rn
[4:01:19] <Floofiie> ^
[4:01:22] <@Solidus_113> Good or bad, it's all content at the end of the day
[4:01:22] <+SlantedSped> guilty gear is the game to lift up all others
[4:01:24] <%jinking79> game did get patch
[4:01:25] <+SlantedSped> first evo, now this
[4:01:26] <%linkwolf4> EMBRACE THE POVERTY
[4:01:29] <CynicalKirby> Didn't they add new characters already?
[4:01:29] <mechatrezion> Woolie do you actually watch sentai?
[4:01:36] <+MoraMiarty> dino thunder was the best
[4:01:38] <$FuqBoiSlim> b-but my discords....
[4:01:39] <NumberTooBig> @Caliburize if it was worked on any longer it wouldve released next to MK11
[4:01:39] <MTLxSpider> this game is more alive than rev2 cuz its not at evo
[4:01:39] <gnarly_memes_bro> "white dino thunder" was my nickname in highschool
[4:01:43] <MTLxSpider> wait
[4:01:44] <%jinking79> free character update soon
[4:01:46] <+attackofthesage> @dull_fangs you sir are a villain lol
[4:01:51] <mechatrezion> you've randomly mentioned toku stuff but Idk if you've ever talked about specific shows
[4:01:51] <CynicalKirby> I see
[4:01:53] <MainMan_Jonadiah> @CynicalKirby Not yet, but 3 free characters are coming soon
[4:01:54] <@Menitta> Woolie: I dont wanna play MK11 because it'll be a new reaction to a game Also Woolie:
[4:01:56] <%shmupdogjoe> I just got an ad for RTX on my feed without having watched any Rooster Teeth stuff since season 1 Red Vs Blue. I blame you, woolie!
[4:02:05] <drefizz> I grew up with Ninja storm onward I think
[4:02:06] <zaptar13> jermaRat Isn't this just a mobile game?
[4:02:07] <Ion_Laser> @MoraMiarty that show has one of the top 5 power rangers theme songs
[4:02:15] <Caliburize> I guess that would've hurt it longer. But then again, Power Rangers is super niche already
[4:02:25] <MTLxSpider> bushido blade?
[4:02:40] <Floofiie> Nickelodeon killed power rangers
[4:02:40] <%linkwolf4> @Menitta tbf this game has been out fpr a month give a take
[4:02:44] <NumberTooBig> considering all the bloat, whens the point RvB turned into zombie RvB
[4:02:46] <+Dull_Fangs> I'm sorry I'm I salty GG player who's been waiting for a real update to GG for a 1 and 1/2
[4:02:53] <@Menitta> Oh I thought it came out like last week lol
[4:02:54] <NumberTooBig> Red v Blue
[4:02:55] <drefizz> Dino thunder's theme helped me get out of a void of depression when I was 13 I shit you not
[4:02:59] <VampirePeriod> they should make a game like this but with funko pops
[4:03:06] <Caliburize> Apparently Beast Morphers supposed to be pretty good
[4:03:10] <MTLxSpider> GG rev2 is probably 1 or 2 years old now? i think?
[4:03:11] <Floofiie> I'm waiting for GG to not gip my wallet with an update costing 40 bucks
[4:03:14] <+Dull_Fangs> And just like Atlus ASW LOVES announcements of announcements
[4:03:20] <+SlantedSped> the mobile game was literally multiplayer rock paper scissors
[4:03:21] <+Dull_Fangs> It is almost 2 years old
[4:03:24] <MTLxSpider> nah Rev2 update was only 20 $
[4:03:26] <+zaworldo> y o
[4:03:27] <hntronium> I started with Wild Force
[4:03:28] <+zaworldo> THE DAMAGE
[4:03:28] <MTLxSpider> come on
[4:03:33] <mistersups> For Red his neutral stab has armor
[4:03:33] <gustavozxd> wait there was a ranger costume for Ryu? I don't remember that
[4:03:33] <+MoraMiarty> I want dino block and galaxy red so I can have a team of tommy olivers
[4:03:35] <+Dull_Fangs> maybe older if you count the arcade release
[4:03:36] <+attackofthesage> @dull_fangs I feel you man. Maybe after evo we’ll get confirmation of something
[4:03:38] <%linkwolf4> yeyeye AND IT IS THE BEST THING TO HAPPEN TO RYU EVER
[4:03:42] <MTLxSpider> yea
[4:03:45] <gustavozxd> I remember just seeing RYU in the roster
[4:03:49] <drefizz> hearing its theme again when I was 13 was just so nostalgic it took 13 year me's depression right away
[4:03:53] <+Dull_Fangs> Its going to be Arc World Tour finals
[4:03:55] <Ion_Laser> Ryu has a Power Rangers suit. And his headband is wrapped around the helmet!
[4:03:57] <MTLxSpider> thats why i play +R right now.
[4:03:58] <+VektorTroika> @linkwolf4 except for that one time he was made into a skullo
[4:04:00] <Floofiie> "Sii hai uh"
[4:04:01] <MTLxSpider> while waiting
[4:04:03] <MTLxSpider> lol
[4:04:04] <+Dull_Fangs> which is next January
[4:04:11] <+cherokee2391> i was kinda hoping to see a ranger from "Ninja storm" to be in here
[4:04:13] <drefizz> Ryu has been a power ranger and Iron fist
[4:04:13] <david_yur_favurid> yoooo voice acting is coming!!!!!
[4:04:19] <MTLxSpider> lmao
[4:04:22] <gustavozxd> they didn't have the budget to hire any voice actors at all NotLikeThis
[4:04:27] <+Dull_Fangs> I was so shocked they got main stage last year and just announced the tour
[4:04:28] <NeroInfinite> DOOT DOOT DOOT
[4:04:28] <NumberTooBig> Red Team at ArcSys is working on Granblue, if there is ANYTHING guilty gear related in production, its concept art by now
[4:04:31] <MTLxSpider> yo see me in abk
[4:04:33] <+MoraMiarty> god I love that dumb ocarina sword
[4:04:34] <%linkwolf4> I want ryu ranger to be canon YESTERDAY
[4:04:34] <MTLxSpider> again
[4:04:38] <david_yur_favurid> JDF will soon be "AIYAAH" ing!!!
[4:04:40] <+SlantedSped> it seems like a super you should use on knockdown
[4:04:45] <gnarly_memes_bro> @cherokee2391 i fully expect there to be at least 1 rep from any power rangers era they can get once they fill out the roster
[4:04:45] <+Dull_Fangs> Red Team means nothing
[4:04:46] <Midnight188> is JUST gokai yellow in this game?
[4:04:51] <Midnight188> Luka finally made it big
[4:04:57] <Caliburize> Of course not, i'm pretty sure people are just as surprised how well this game looks as it is now
[4:05:06] <%DedlokPM> DedlokPM subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! Go Go Scrublord Rangers!
[4:05:08] <Floofiie> Yeah just Gokai Yellow
[4:05:10] <+zaworldo> big combo
[4:05:15] <+Dull_Fangs> it was just a skunkworks that de pre production for Xrd
[4:05:16] <Floofiie> Which sucks cause Megaforce sucks
[4:05:24] <+MoraMiarty> man, I hope we get all the tommys actually
[4:05:27] <Floofiie> MegaBlue was the only OK aspect of that season
[4:05:27] <zaptar13> Did that guy have a shotgun?
[4:05:27] <PlainSimpleTailor> Anybody else got a donation page that doesn't work?
[4:05:28] <+SlantedSped> the megazord attack depends on which button you press
[4:05:31] <drefizz> Noah was the only good Megaforce ranger
[4:05:33] <+Dull_Fangs> there isn't an official team blue either
[4:05:33] <+attackofthesage> I’m not expecting much from Granblue
[4:05:34] <david_yur_favurid> different buttons give you different zord attacks
[4:05:34] <Caliburize> Even the actors on Megaforce agreed
[4:05:44] <Caliburize> it sucked
[4:05:44] <hntronium> Calling both should get a fight in the background between zords
[4:05:47] <MTLxSpider> wow
[4:05:48] <+Dull_Fangs> I'm being such an ass rn lol
[4:05:50] <MTLxSpider> kusoge
[4:05:57] <+Dull_Fangs> no but this is good kusoge
[4:06:00] <hntronium> And then the winner will assist
[4:06:03] <drefizz> Noah had a lot of development and had that badass 1v1 with that sword guy
[4:06:04] <+Dull_Fangs> like P4A Kappa
[4:06:08] <Floofiie> If anyone skipped the Nick era please watch Dino Charge it's a diamond in a Neo Saban era of shit
[4:06:11] <MTLxSpider> P4a was a good game
[4:06:12] <MTLxSpider> though
[4:06:20] <Bloogoose> This isn't nearly as kusoge as P4A Keepo
[4:06:24] <+Dull_Fangs> had some dumb ass shit
[4:06:28] <CaptainSkelly> Yo when's Jojo Heritage for the Future
[4:06:32] <+Dull_Fangs> yoooo
[4:06:34] <drefizz> Megaforce's red ranger, was terrible
[4:06:35] <+Dull_Fangs> yeah when is that
[4:06:38] <MainMan_Jonadiah> There was a happy birthday in there, for just a sec
[4:06:38] <elrey745> RPM was the best disney one
[4:06:40] <MTLxSpider> the P4A was fun to watch
[4:06:40] <+Rada150> you would think now that Hasbro owns power rangers they could have more budget to create their own unique stuff like american only zords or rangers
[4:06:47] <NumberTooBig> if you read the interview, Granblue's a game made for people who may have never used a controller before, with buffs and healing on cooldown for specials is what i remember
[4:06:48] <MTLxSpider> combos and stuff
[4:06:55] <Bloogoose> Oh god shut up about the Turbo Blue Ranger
[4:06:58] <Floofiie> Megaforce and Samurai red rangers were both god awful
[4:06:59] <Caliburize> There's gonna be a blue ranger, but it's the 2017 movie one
[4:06:59] <+Dull_Fangs> I didn't hear the cooldown thing
[4:06:59] <+SlantedSped> hasbro spending money? lmao
[4:07:00] <NumberTooBig> paraphrasing a tiny bit here
[4:07:03] <david_yur_favurid> blue ranger coming next update
[4:07:05] <london_flexing> BILL INCOMING AS FREELC
[4:07:08] <Floofiie> Samurai Red was basically made to be jesus
[4:07:11] <+Dull_Fangs> Also if healing works like VsaV I'm fine with it
[4:07:14] <ManOfReason> even now billy is bullied :(
[4:07:14] <%linkwolf4> o my god THE CHILD
[4:07:17] <+Davaxe> Who did SPD, cause that was my favorite of the newer Rangers
[4:07:19] <Ion_Laser> @Bloogoose don't get me started on THAT Blue Ranger
[4:07:30] <labanderox> what is this chip
[4:07:32] <MTLxSpider> yo amane?
[4:07:34] <drefizz> @Floofiie give me a second to give you one saving grace of super megaforce
[4:07:36] <+MoraMiarty> because saban is greedy
[4:07:37] <zaptar13> How can you beat shotgun?
[4:07:38] <MTLxSpider> amane with a gun?
[4:07:38] <MainMan_Jonadiah> It's the blue ranger from the movie... Not THAT movie, the new one.
[4:07:40] <Floofiie> @Bloogoose Chill bro the kid was alright the only shit thing was him growing extra limbs
[4:07:41] <SomersaultJustice> I just realzied, did that switch port of skullgirls ever come out?
[4:07:43] <Bloogoose> Copyright probably.
[4:07:43] <KitsuneManami> ZEEOOO GOOOO ZEEEOOO
[4:07:44] <eldragon_1> I hate that they translated Gokaiger as "Megaforce"
[4:07:46] <zamzoph> LIGHT. SPEED. GOOOOOOOOOOOO
[4:07:48] <NumberTooBig> sure that last hit was chip Kappa
[4:07:48] <%MightyMaxT> Go Power Rangers, goo......IN SPACE
[4:07:50] <+AngriestAngryArtist> light speed rescue's theme song is pretty damn fucking good LOL
[4:07:51] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[4:07:52] <raveous> to be fair, a real shotgun would probably do a lot of chip damage
[4:07:59] <%linkwolf4> @SomersaultJustice soon
[4:08:02] <Floofiie> And they had to skip the angel card game theme for US
[4:08:04] <labanderox> bringing a sword to a gunfight
[4:08:12] <+Dull_Fangs> lol
[4:08:20] <%linkwolf4> because they are SHITTY ASSHOLES
[4:08:23] <Floofiie> Yo when are they bring the PSYCHO RANGERS in this game
[4:08:24] <gustavozxd> they don't have the money to put it in this game
[4:08:24] <umbrus89> i love shift into turbo
[4:08:29] <Caliburize> There's a lot of fucking licensing issue needs to done, plus they don't actually own the music, it's Ron Wasserman who does @WoolieVersus
[4:08:33] <powerprotoman> its a good thing hasbro owns pwoer rangers now
[4:08:37] <%wujak> they dont make the power rangers karate noises when they attack either
[4:08:40] <zaptar13> What does Kusoge mean?
[4:08:45] <+Dull_Fangs> shit game
[4:08:47] <Johno_san> was lost galaxy trying to be startrec or something?
[4:08:47] <gustavozxd> do you really thing they have any budget for that woolie? with 9 characters? LUL
[4:08:53] <%jinking79> 6 charters coming soon 3 will be free
[4:08:55] <Bloogoose> If this game had budget, I would legit want it to have like 80 characters
[4:09:01] <Bloogoose> There's so much potential
[4:09:03] <+Ecchigun> @zaptar13 shit game
[4:09:07] <NumberTooBig> @zaptar13 Kusoge （クソゲー） is a Japanese word for "shitty game".
[4:09:11] <zaptar13> oh ok
[4:09:13] <NumberTooBig> straight from google
[4:09:13] <Floofiie> @Johno_san Lost Galaxy was trying to ride In Space's coattails after In Space was made to basically end the series
[4:09:14] <Caliburize> Hasbro's been doing a good job with PR
[4:09:16] <CaptainSkelly> When's jojo heritage for the future my guy
[4:09:22] <haisho> TL Note: Geemu means Game
[4:09:22] <rabbi2himself> What we got was still pretty great for the budget
[4:09:33] <+Ecchigun> i like car girl too
[4:09:36] <MTLxSpider> BAD GAME
[4:09:37] <+Ecchigun> cat *
[4:09:37] <%Wool> JUN THE SWAN
[4:09:38] <NumberTooBig> yeah thats a good question, when IS Heritage for the future
[4:09:41] <elrey745> *Genm means Game
[4:09:42] <+MoraMiarty> @WoolieVersus how many tommys do you want in this game, given that hes been at least 5 different rangers
[4:09:42] <+Dull_Fangs> yo whens TvC
[4:09:45] <+Ecchigun> whatever its car girl now
[4:09:46] <tmo200> This music is kinda cool
[4:09:56] <+radda343> it's so weird that they turned DekaSwan into a cat girl
[4:09:57] <%jinking79> Bull
[4:09:59] <tykai1> Joe the Condor?
[4:10:03] <gustavozxd> @rabbi2himself I heard the game is actually fun so tbh I agree
[4:10:12] <ManOfReason> tvc is high quality jank
[4:10:12] <eldragon_1> Katana means Japanese sword Kappa
[4:10:13] <gnarly_memes_bro> so kusoge is basically japanese for "jank"? more or less?
[4:10:15] <Bloogoose> THE BUTTON HAS BEEN FOUND
[4:10:23] <Floofiie> Man I love the tatsunoko art but I can't stand the same artist in MvC3 and CvS 2
[4:10:33] <NeroInfinite> the GUN button
[4:10:42] <Johno_san> @Floofiie hmm i know saban were kinda monsters but hearing a cold fact like that ruins some childhood magic those seasons had
[4:10:46] <+Dull_Fangs> Oh shit Floofile with the hot takes
[4:10:49] <NumberTooBig> @gnarly_memes_bro its less jank and more a combo of jank poor gameplay
[4:10:55] <%Wool> this game kinda looks and feels like a mobile game
[4:10:58] <heroicspiritavenger> @gnarly_memes_bro Kusoge=Shit game kuso=shit and ge for game
[4:11:10] <labanderox> gun is best OS
[4:11:11] <Floofiie> TvC Chun art is god tier compared to other games
[4:11:15] <NumberTooBig> and bootlegs if its real bad
[4:11:28] <+Jhylla81> fun fact: theres is a season of power rangers/super sentai loosely based on gatchaman called Jetman. its grest
[4:11:31] <gnarly_memes_bro> @NumberTooBig mmmk, i like dp4a but it definitely felt a little uneven so that sounds right to me
[4:11:34] <+Jhylla81> *great
[4:11:43] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Heads up, in case people in the chat don't know. There was a recent patch for this game that allowed people to block low online.
[4:11:51] <zaptar13> What season was it where their visors were just basic geometric shapes? Space? Lightspeed rescue or something?
[4:12:01] <+Jhylla81> zeo
[4:12:02] <+radda343> Zeo
[4:12:04] <Bloogoose> Oh yeah you couldn't block low online for a while
[4:12:05] <%Wool> Zeo
[4:12:05] <+SlantedSped> i'm not gonna pretend like i've ever blocked a low so it's ok
[4:12:06] <Bloogoose> That was a thing
[4:12:12] <+Dull_Fangs> wait
[4:12:17] <heroicspiritavenger> @zaptar13 Lightspeed Rescue/GoGoV
[4:12:18] <+Dull_Fangs> no sarcasm there
[4:12:30] <Bloogoose> No sarcasm, you literally couldn't.
[4:12:32] <gnarly_memes_bro> low block is an urban legend fabricated to confuse newbies
[4:12:33] <+WonderLandGhost> First time seeing this game in action, is it considered pretty good?
[4:12:34] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Nah, legit couldn't block low.
[4:12:35] <heroicspiritavenger> @zaptar13 or Zeo/OhRanger
[4:12:37] <+Dull_Fangs> wtf
[4:12:41] <NumberTooBig> pizza cutter's real good
[4:12:42] <Floofiie> @Johno_san Lost Galaxy still carried a lot of goodness, all the seasons were pretty good (except people not liking Mystic Force and Operation Overdrive) and RPM kind of finished the Disney era, and RPM was kickass, probably top 5 seasons
[4:12:48] <SomersaultJustice> lol
[4:12:50] <+Jhylla81> And the shapes for the helmets in Zeo are based on the shapes that appear in cards that are used to test ESP
[4:12:50] <zaptar13> Are there any of those in this or is that a Saban thing?
[4:12:54] <+ItsAGundamu> why though?
[4:13:00] <NumberTooBig> Bionic ARM...S
[4:13:00] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Who needs a 50-50, when you have 100-0 mixups
[4:13:14] <heroicspiritavenger> @zaptar13 No this game has no Zeo or Lightspeed reps
[4:13:16] <+Dull_Fangs> when's KAKUTO CHOJIN
[4:13:20] <Bloogoose> I've seen a bug where P1 wins online, only to have it cut to the P2 victory screen
[4:13:24] <+Dull_Fangs> we need more 3D love
[4:13:24] <Bloogoose> Its insane
[4:13:25] <raveous> isn't a 100-0 mixup just a meaty
[4:13:28] <zamzoph> Can we get that guy from Samurai who killed a guy with a sword?
[4:13:30] <gnarly_memes_bro> whens super slam?
[4:13:35] <verathys> Someone do the Green Ranger infinite
[4:13:37] <hypecactuar> ggs bois!
[4:13:42] <Bloogoose> Do the Kat Infinite
[4:13:42] <Floofiie> @zamzoph That was the wild force red ranger that stabbed his roommate
[4:13:45] <+Dull_Fangs> fucking hell
[4:13:46] <tmo200> Now they gotta watch twitter combos
[4:13:52] <+Dull_Fangs> damn ya'll have no love
[4:13:53] <raveous> aka the "non-mixup" mixup
[4:13:53] <tmo200> To see its full potential
[4:14:03] <%Solidnick18> thanks for the stream
[4:14:04] <tanarath> Thanks for streaming.
[4:14:05] <zamzoph> @Floofiie I'd rather have the Samurai character, tho
[4:14:07] <heroicspiritavenger> @floofiie He played a villain in Power Rangers Samurai
[4:14:07] <+cherokee2391> can't wait to see this at EVO
[4:14:09] <+Dull_Fangs> I've never seen you go so hard on something
[4:14:11] <%Wool> arigato
[4:14:12] <Bloogoose> Thanks for the Fight Games Woolz
[4:14:12] <zaptar13> They have a lot of source material to pull from but this kinda seems barebones
[4:14:13] <Johno_san> @Floofiie i think i got lost/grew up right around RMP/overdrive. I remember the dinoforce somewhat. fucking mystic was tight to me. and WILDFORCE !!!
[4:14:15] <+Dull_Fangs> there's shit
[4:14:19] <Papafleish> wait me stupid do you like or don't like
[4:14:27] <Floofiie> right fuck, at least i was able to forget some of samurai
[4:14:28] <indigoblooper> nah this game is good actually tho lmao
[4:14:31] <gnarly_memes_bro> the marvel thirst is real
[4:14:33] <powerprotoman> shame you didnt wait for the update
[4:14:41] <NumberTooBig> @zamzoph deker would make for a good Vergil function
[4:14:42] <Johno_san> @Floofiie wait Disney owned saban or something?
[4:14:45] <gustavozxd> oh come on woolie it's not THAT bad
[4:14:47] <eldragon_1> I think my favorite of the later seasons was Wild Force because of ZEN-AKU
[4:14:49] <startstoprepeat> unfortunately you're now legally obliged to rebrand as saban's woolieversus
[4:14:49] <+Jhylla81> I'd say this game needs a year or so of DLC and polisj
[4:14:55] <%Solidnick18> nope
[4:14:55] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:14:56] <+Jhylla81> *polish
[4:15:00] <CynicalKirby> How can this be a MVC clone when you don't have the Quantum Ranger for the Vergil fill in
[4:15:01] <ManOfReason> your 10 years too early woolie
[4:15:04] <gnarly_memes_bro> theres something here for sure but it needs more time in the oven
[4:15:10] <+Dull_Fangs> @WoolieVersus's guest don't get bodied at KSB! Do Montreal proud
[4:15:17] <indigoblooper> yeah but it couldnt have any more time in the oven in this year
[4:15:20] <rabbi2himself> Honestly you’re going too hard on it.
[4:15:22] <indigoblooper> look at how stacked this year is for fg's lmfao
[4:15:22] <Bloogoose> W00-L13
[4:15:26] <Magnetgear> backto the dojo bois

[4:16:04] <Floofiie> @Johno_san At least check out SPD as well, it's writing is top 5 as well. It goes Saban era, Post-Zordon Era, Disney Era, Nick/Neo-Saban Era, Hasbro Era
[4:16:31] <%Wool> what does being sponsored by Fakku entail

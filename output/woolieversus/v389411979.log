[0:44:45] <%yeknomlive> he's learning
[0:44:47] <+kiiiirsten> I had a tiny cactus that was attached to a refrigerator magnet and it lived 1000 years so how did she do that
[0:44:48] <sakeydo> Hey chat. I'm going to ask this queastion very carefully...Woolies been very busy and active but I can't help wondering if he will have future guest spots with Matt or Liam. Thoughts? I guess part of me is just curious if these bridges still stand and have become more quiet, private, and casual social connections. Know what I mean.
[0:44:50] <Kghaleon> King crimson this stream.
[0:44:51] <+Emperor_Bad> oh shit is this the beginning

[0:45:03] <%yeknomlive> explore away
[0:45:08] <+twohitgood> okay so the green is constant...was wondering if that was because i said green was my favorite color.
[0:45:18] <durqi> the best way to take care of a cactus is to just not touch it most of the time
[0:45:19] <%UrsulaCat> @sakeydo he’s still doing nier with Liam
[0:45:19] <Ner234> @Emperor_Bad Yeah they jus started

[0:46:16] <+thewisewolf> i work in a bakery and im kind of sick of cakes
[0:46:19] <+JenovasPuppet> I worked next to a Lush and couldn't smell it at all.

[0:46:32] <sortedspiral> Know someone who worked at a bakery ended up HATING the smell of frosting
[0:46:33] <MarylandJutsu> BIG CARB
[0:46:34] <Graxe_> Humans are very good at adapting to their situation and then it becomes normal.
[0:46:36] <+ThatGuyfromMars> why not just go to a cinnabon and ask someone?
[0:46:40] <zafooru> I desperately want to work there so I can either be surrounded by delicious cinnamon buns and love it OR rewire my head to want less unhealthy snacks
[0:46:51] <+kiiiirsten> @ThatGuyfromMars I'm sure everyone who works at cinnabon would just tell you "this sucks man"
[0:46:52] <tacostarvedbeast> you would be sick of it within 2 weeks
[0:46:52] <%UrsulaCat> @woolieversus work in Baltimore
[0:46:56] <vexicbayn> semi related, worked at a theater for a long time and like I don't give a shit about popcorn but I never got tired of that, if we use the transitive property Cinnnabon is the shit 25/8

[1:53:58] <%GohanEgret> NANI
[1:54:06] <%strugglepunk2> @WoolieVersus You'll be able to do a yellowing action with Kris and then spare them immediately with Ralsei
[1:54:30] <Lieutenant_America> One thing I do love about Deltarune is how its OST carries the tradition of having a recurring melody in most of its tracks
[1:54:32] <fairore> you don't have to punch me in the face
[1:54:34] <CuttleCrow> the rest will fall into place in time

[1:59:18] <+SlumberJunkie> vineMayro vineTalian I find-a your accent offensive!
[1:59:20] <Lieutenant_America> @MyNameIsRasus Surprisingly, the newest episode actually makes it easier to get the gist of King Crimson's power
[1:59:25] <nutimik> nice voice crack
[1:59:27] <zeroraider> smoldering? did Susie crash into it??
[1:59:32] <leoneofthestars> XDDD
[1:59:33] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> @MyNameIsRasus THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE YOU CAN'T ERASE TIME
[1:59:37] <Lieutenant_America> It's still hard to explain in words, but you "get" the time skip
[1:59:39] <+ThatGuyfromMars> man I love how this builds on undertale, the sound effects, the better sprite work
[1:59:42] <+ThatGuyfromMars> it's so good
[1:59:47] <ChortlesJ1> AHHHHH, Rude Buster and Field of Hopes and Dreams are SO GOOD
[1:59:50] <MyNameIsRasus> @lieutenant_america ikr the anime actually made it understandable

[2:00:30] <Lieutenant_America> @MyNameIsRasus It's amazing how a medium can effect comprehensibility
[2:00:32] <%Nomad_Scholar> KC takes the Cause of anything thats happened within 10 seconds erases it and the Effect is no longer exists

[2:01:00] <Chaoko99> Yeaaah!
[2:01:03] <+dodge_and_dust> being able to spare multiple enemies in a turn is nice
[2:01:09] <shiraihellfyre> moon2CUTE
[2:01:12] <JanusII> 1 month from now she's still at this couch being a gremlin playing every game Woolie owns.
[2:01:29] <nutimik> nope, it's grazing
[2:01:31] <%Chichen> grazing
[2:01:31] <qo_op> 🎷
[2:01:32] <shiraihellfyre> thats grazing, you get bonus tp for that
[2:01:33] <nutimik> gives TP
[2:01:33] <prof_p_plum> the outline gets you more TP
[2:01:34] <Psyramics> that grazing charges TP
[2:01:34] <%GohanEgret> outline is building TP
[2:01:37] <%strugglepunk2> @WoolieVersus With two enemies, it's better to combo spare one enemy so the screen is less hectic
[2:01:37] <%imextremelymanly> nope you get power by doing that
[2:01:37] <%salty_syd913> grazing gives TP
[2:01:38] <Lieutenant_America> Nope. The outline means a NEAR hit, which gives you Meter
[2:01:38] <EASrake> Combat Edging
[2:01:39] <TyroneRugen> grazing gives you tension points
[2:01:39] <Bionicghost> it's ikaruga, woolie
[2:01:40] <BeeNoons> EDGE
[2:01:41] <@Solidus_113> it's a graze mechanic like your 2hus
[2:01:41] <ShreddingPixels> EDGE
[2:01:41] <+furiousfurioso> grazing gives TP
[2:01:42] <$cureneckbeard> graze
[2:01:43] <+skylerpilot> @WoolieVersus when you see the outline that means you gained TP for a near miss
[2:01:43] <MyNameIsRasus> EDGE
[2:01:46] <AlfredoChicken> InB4 first tries jevil
[2:01:50] <Sloavon> EDGE
[2:01:50] <CuttleCrow> grazing, it gives you TP and makes your turn come faster
[2:01:50] <zeroraider> when you edge you get TP
[2:01:52] <Sonicdy> E D G E
[2:02:14] <Volkrotia> Danmaku Unlimited 3's got a great grazing system
[2:02:15] <%HossMosh> It’s in Road Redemption randomly enough

[2:40:58] <Sloavon> WOOL HORSE
[2:40:59] <Lieutenant_America> Pat is an Unknown Quantity
[2:41:00] <%Order_of_Mystery> Toby is, no joke, one of the best composers in the industry
[2:41:02] <Prism_Wing> is the
[2:41:09] <Prism_Wing> is there?*
[2:41:09] <%yoshkosh20> pat is a strange goblin
[2:41:12] <%Order_of_Mystery> I cannot think of a single bad song he's ever made
[2:41:16] <nutimik> Mick Gordon is still MVP imo
[2:41:17] <vexicbayn> @order_of_mystery we found a Hot Tamales style cinnamon, blue raspberry, chocolate. and like cherry or some shit, they were fun experiments but cleanip took forever and they ultimately were garbage
[2:41:22] <Laironx3> @woolieversus Use manual during a battle and see what happens. Item>Manual.
[2:41:27] <ivansonic08> There are 3 Forces in the world Good, Evil, and Pat
[2:41:31] <+skylerpilot> Steff's Ralsei sounds like a Minnesotan soccer mom
[2:42:12] <+skylerpilot> I guess that would be a Hockey mom...
[2:42:13] <monzy101> did he play titanfall 2 yet?
[2:42:14] <+Toa697> Powerful
[2:42:14] <Lieutenant_America> I didn't even know you could do this!
[2:42:23] <Maxpainx10000> LUL
[2:42:28] <%king_wragles> So I looked around the chat to see where @WoolieVersus was reading that stuff, then I realized he reads donations as he streams...
[2:42:35] <sakuraa98> toby fox made banger homestuck music for its whole lifetime so hes really good at this shit now
[2:42:42] <%GohanEgret> @monzy101 that was last week, tonight is deltarune and perhaps nier automata
[2:42:44] <%imextremelymanly> nw toss the manual
[2:42:46] <nutimik> I hope she tries tossing away the manual
[2:42:58] <%UrsulaCat> undertale exists because of homestuck mpreg fan art
[2:43:01] <monzy101> but... ps4 :(
[2:43:01] <%Order_of_Mystery> yo @WoolieVersus : buttered popcorn, cinnamon, sugar. Bam. There's your cinnabon right there
[2:43:05] <+SlumberJunkie> @sakuraa98 Don't forget the Earthbound ROM hacks.
[2:43:45] <EASrake> Yeah but Checking tho
[2:43:46] <%laserbeaming> TENSION
[2:44:05] <+JackMillerTime> thats a good idea
[2:44:07] <%Order_of_Mystery> smell and taste
[2:44:08] <EASrake> Taste i would imagine
[2:44:08] <%GohanEgret> what
[2:44:10] <FenixSeraph> Jelly Bellies?
[2:44:11] <Novillion> no eat it
[2:44:13] <NumbusPlays> "buttered popcorn? What is...?"
[2:44:18] <Shiranui24> that sounds good
[2:44:18] <+kelvinxj> eat it tho
[2:44:19] <%Order_of_Mystery> helps it stick together
[2:44:26] <%UrsulaCat> buttered popcorn is starch
[2:44:26] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Someone mentioned working at a movie theater before.
[2:44:28] <%Order_of_Mystery> and be sure to thank @vexicbayn
[2:44:28] <+JackMillerTime> naw but a bucket of it
[2:44:31] <%king_wragles> Cinnabon uses butter in their cinnamon stuff @WoolieVersus
[2:44:33] <gslayer14> im gonna make that
[2:44:33] <%Epic_Skeptic> I rather just have Cinnabon
[2:44:35] <%laserbeaming> 69 tension. Nice
[2:44:39] <gslayer14> thanks random chat member
[2:44:44] <+rdark_ksu> i will never understand the desire for cinnamon
[2:44:45] <xtremegamer80> Best boss battle coming up soon
[2:44:45] <+RowenCleric> cinnamon buns are made with butter
[2:44:50] <EASrake> Butter is a rather important part of everything that tastes good
[2:44:54] <vexicbayn> I've done a good thing today
[2:44:57] <%king_wragles> Ya, just having cinnabon would be easier
[2:45:01] <%Agami23> @WoolieVersus there used to be a glitch with the PC version of the game that would triple the speed of the game.
[2:45:43] <+Toa697> it was if you set it to full screen it would unlock from 60 to the monitor refresh right?
[2:45:47] <%UrsulaCat> ralsei you're so hurt
[2:46:00] <CuttleCrow> yeah fullscreen was messed up
[2:46:08] <vexicbayn> RUB CINNAMON ON THE BOY
[2:46:11] <%Order_of_Mystery> did she give Ralsei the bow?
[2:46:16] <nutimik> yea

[2:46:32] <+Toa697> ralsei needs to heelz tho
[2:46:44] <vexicbayn> it's....... for his health...
[2:46:47] <+Toa697> no you cant
[2:46:56] <nutimik> ralsei can heal himself
[2:46:59] <qo_op> nope

[2:47:23] <OtakuShooter> you can eat stuff to heal yoruself
[2:47:24] <TooNaCly4U> no use spells

[2:47:26] <%king_wragles> You can eat to heal back up
[2:47:26] <%stagemage> its fine tho
[2:47:27] <NumbusPlays> Remember that whenever you get to a save point you heal fully anyway
[2:47:28] <OtakuShooter> outside the fight
[2:47:30] <VorpalSlash> You can heal with items, not spells
[2:47:31] <TyroneRugen> heal items work, not spells
[2:47:33] <EASrake> You can use items out of battle. Just not the Ralsei's heal
[2:47:34] <BestTeaMaker> 3
[2:47:35] <jase__x> you can heal outside of battle wth

[2:47:51] <%king_wragles> Don't say chat when it's just one person @WoolieVersus
[2:47:52] <%DedlokPM> @WoolieVersus I think they meant spells
[2:47:52] <RiverBirch> You can't use the SPELL HEAL
[2:47:53] <TooNaCly4U> use spells for free
[2:47:53] <%Agami23> you can use items outside of battle, but you can use spells for free IN battle
[2:47:54] <+Emperor_Bad> chat has never told the truth once

[3:02:21] <+cvp5127> KOWASHITAI
[3:02:22] <aiyobro> "earthbound" is really good, nah just cute
[3:02:31] <%king_wragles> Is the DMC 5 LP starting as soon as it's released or are you and Pat gonna wait a bit @WoolieVersus ? (the delay with LPs being pre recorded excluded)
[3:02:32] <$BioStormX> Do you still get the activated charcoal? Do you buy a tub of powder, or those anti-gas caps, or what
[3:02:32] <$KnivesEve> @WoolieVersus i stuck with tokyo mirage session lp. ill stick to whatever
[3:02:33] <%laserbeaming> Mother 3 is fantastic. Will never, ever get localized
[3:02:34] <aiyobro> mother 3 is dope
[3:02:40] <CuttleCrow> Mother 3 is v. v. good
[3:02:41] <Goat_Baka> Mother 3 is really strong
[3:02:41] <%foreverN2dust> I would just skip to mother 3
[3:02:43] <Lieutenant_America> Reggie died trying to localize it
[3:02:43] <nutimik> Earhtbound wasn't my thing, very slow game
[3:02:43] <%laserbeaming> no fucking way
[3:02:45] <+these_pockets> Are you playing on Switch, or have you ascended and realised Pro Controller is best PC pad
[3:02:46] <Calek> you set your expectations high for mother 3? but why
[3:02:46] <haitakaa> what about Father 4?
[3:02:52] <Spydurman> Woloie Will Figure it Out episde 5?
[3:02:56] <Kain5707> Woolie limesLove

[3:03:13] <Calek> 1/3
[3:03:14] <Lieutenant_America> halfway there
[3:03:16] <EASrake> what about 7 Grand Dad Kappa

[3:03:34] <Maxpainx10000> Lancer said half way
[3:03:36] <aiyobro> blood dragon?
[3:03:37] <ivansonic08> Adam Nelly/4
[3:03:40] <%laserbeaming> But consider that Undertale/Deltarune are kind of better than Earthbound/Mother 3. At least to me.

[3:06:52] <Kain5707> @WoolieVersus this was created before Undertale he might have already had the music done
[3:06:54] <+Toa697> burger truck
[3:06:56] <nutimik> Bergentrückung
[3:06:58] <%strugglepunk2> He's the type to actually do the music first and let that color the scene
[3:06:58] <Lieutenant_America> Megalovania is interesting in that it's been a constantly evolving track
[3:07:00] <ivansonic08> BEkentruck
[3:07:01] <FenixSeraph> Burger Truck King
[3:07:04] <Lieutenant_America> Over a long period of time
[3:07:04] <gslayer14> borgar
[3:07:05] <%king_wragles> It translates to Mountain King @WoolieVersus
[3:07:11] <AlfredoChicken> bergentruckung
[3:07:11] <%UrsulaCat> I miss WoolXLiam nier episodes @woolieversus
[3:07:13] <%kapcommunist> woolie knows his stuff!
[3:07:15] <+ssulcer> Undertale OR: How 1 man taught the world about leimotiffs
[3:07:16] <NumbusPlays> the halloween hack
[3:07:16] <CatmanIX> "king under the mountain"
[3:07:18] <BeeNoons> earthbound hack and homestuck
[3:07:18] <aiyobro> it's always day time at whoolies house
[3:07:21] <Goat_Baka> Bergentrückung and ASGORE is the main theme
[3:07:22] <NJigglypuff> the halloween earthbound hack
[3:07:23] <Lieutenant_America> Halloween Hack, then Homestuck, then Undertale
[3:07:27] <+paladinstarbuster> burgertrucking
[3:07:33] <%king_wragles> @CatmanIX actually ya, I think that was it.
[3:07:33] <+Forente> He was work shopping it for a while
[3:07:33] <+ThatGuyfromMars> lancer's theme sounds like a really slowed down version of bonetrussel
[3:07:36] <+KingZaffy> Hot take: Megalovania is actually crazy overrated and Undertale/Deltarun have way better tracks in them
[3:07:39] <majindusto> Uhg...Homestuck
[3:07:40] <Lieutenant_America> The Homestuck version of Megalovania is my personal favorite
[3:07:47] <Tisaric> fingas in his asss
[3:07:50] <+Papafleish> can you make your characters do a dab?
[3:07:50] <%UrsulaCat> Homed stuck

[3:36:25] <+SomeCrazyWizbiz> @wolfofsound LUL
[3:36:26] <%GohanEgret> @WoolieVersus chat meant that you can't use healing spells outside of battle since it takes TP

[3:38:12] <tacostarvedbeast> RK=Liam
[3:38:20] <CuttleCrow> his Vegas playthough was painful
[3:38:20] <wydamn> One of my favorite moments was when Pat beat the game, and then had an anxiety-induced meltdown over what might have happened if he used up more magnum ammo before the final boss.

[3:46:41] <Ner234> Woolie: *screams internally*
[3:46:43] <SixthSun2> KEK is a mispelling of LEL, which is a corruption of lul
[3:46:45] <%king_wragles> well, didn't know that... big whoosh for me
[3:46:45] <laazybulbasaur> Uh oh
[3:46:48] <%DeaconBluesClues> I didn't even realize
[3:46:49] <zafooru> orcs like to laugh
[3:46:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> WoW not 4Chan
[3:46:52] <Mr_Strut> It means you thought the thing was funny
[3:46:52] <SchroedingersFerret> It's a turkish snack
[3:46:58] <$cureneckbeard> lulz, a corruption of LOL
[3:47:02] <+XzileGaming> apatWrong ?
[3:47:04] <%Cavumentum> Horde translation of LOL becomes KEK
[3:47:06] <qo_op> kek is WoW orcs saying LOL wich is korean or something
[3:47:07] <P1ngas> monkaS
[3:47:07] <Goraka91> Oh right yeah it's a language filter, 'lol' from a Horde becomes 'kek' to an Alliance player
[3:47:08] <Angry_Ev1L> ace combat 7 when?
[3:47:08] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> 4Chan has everything though
[3:47:08] <dabirSA> when a horde player says lol, an alliance player would have seen 'kek'
[3:47:09] <+ThatGuyfromMars> what the hell are you doing on 4chan
[3:47:09] <caol2017> KEK is wow, topkek came after?

[3:47:12] <Lieutenant_America> HIM
[3:47:12] <+KingZaffy> When typing "lol" on the horde side, any alliance players nearby would see it typed as "kek". Other way around "lol" appeared as "bur" for the horde players.
[3:47:12] <Youwereeatenbyalid> it means LoL in orcish
[3:47:13] <Murphio_GS> Kek is orcish for lol
[3:47:13] <Nuck_Chorris3> Have you seen the topkek ad?
[3:47:13] <$cureneckbeard> kekekek

[3:48:26] <+skylerpilot> the Kek thing doesn't come from WoW though guys, the 4chan / where it really came from on the internet is from a Foreign snack commercial featuring a little person who couldn't reach the Kek on the top shelf

[3:50:25] <%Klefth> Man, these licensing deals are messing everything up
[3:50:25] <%DonatelloJose> Crunchy role lost MHA too. CR is slipping hard.
[3:50:30] <+sundayafternoon1> no one knows wether season 4 will show up on crunchy roll though
[3:50:30] <%DedlokPM> Season 2 and 3 is still on crunchyroll at least
[3:50:31] <hatesdps> @WoolieVersus if vrv is a possibility for you its the best
[3:50:33] <aiyobro> i haven't watched legal t.v. in like a year
[3:50:34] <+Zeemod155> Is this a Season 4 thing? Cause I'm looking at Season 3 on Crunchyroll right now...
[3:50:40] <CuttleCrow> R)
[3:50:45] <vexicbayn> VRV has MHA, ReBoot AND SWAT KATS
[3:50:51] <%yeknomlive> ye
[3:50:52] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Thanks Sony for ruining Crunchyroll
[3:50:58] <TyroneRugen> woot
[3:50:58] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:50:58] <Froyuken> What's VRV?
[3:50:58] <+LogothX> ask the chat
[3:50:59] <%DedlokPM> @Zeemod155 Season 1 is not on crunchyroll now
[3:51:00] <%DonatelloJose> Delta Rune vibes is solid.
[3:51:04] <+griffball13> SPONSERED BY REDBULL
[3:51:05] <eggsnbakefest> @WoolieVersus Why not get to at least the secret boss first?
[3:51:06] <laazybulbasaur> Was it sony?
[3:51:09] <th3madness> this cannot continue
[3:51:11] <%king_wragles> @Zeemod155 they're not removing the old seasons, but the new one won't be on Crunchy Roll (they split with Funimation in a way)
[3:51:11] <+bobfriskit> Can you not watch My hero on crunch no more?
[3:51:19] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @laazybulbasaur Sony bought Funimation
[3:51:22] <%laserbeaming> 10-15
[3:51:24] <%DedlokPM> @Froyuken another streaming service run by the people who own Crunchyroll
[3:51:25] <CuttleCrow> B) *siip* DrinkPurple #sponsored
[3:51:27] <%DeaconBluesClues> >social eating
[3:51:28] <+skylerpilot> @zafooru nah the commercial is the origin of Top Kek. The WoW thing is pretty coincidental or maybe more transient in its relation to the meme. the fact that its so easy to meld the two for sure lends credence to the fact that the WoW thing probably helped it stick because a lot of people probably used / laughed at it because they thought it was related
[3:51:29] <%foreverN2dust> Social Eating is fun though
[3:51:29] <Lieutenant_America> Veggies and Red Bull, the ultimate combo
[3:51:30] <laazybulbasaur> Oh shit
[3:51:30] <seylumiue> Social eating!
[3:51:31] <hatesdps> hot shade on pat and paige

[3:51:36] <AlfredoChicken> mukbang! mukbang! mukbang!
[3:51:36] <%laserbeaming> Social Eating is a thing
[3:51:36] <ScreamingMeat> I'll just pirate MHA. Funimation can eat a dick
[3:51:38] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus switch the game over to Social Eating
[3:51:39] <+MagickBurritoh> Social Eating is a Twitch category
[3:51:40] <+velemi> Woolie we watch pat and paige eat all the time
[3:51:41] <+blastazoid26> Mugbank
[3:51:42] <invader_rin> Social eating is a thing
[3:51:43] <CatmanIX> "social eating" is a valid category
[3:51:43] <+MMetas> Pat and Paige do it all the time!
[3:51:44] <%yeknomlive> just switch to social eating
[3:51:48] <lizard0tm> Why not just Social Eating?
[3:51:56] <%DonatelloJose> This stream has standards. woolieMIRIN
[3:51:56] <%Cavumentum> Yo Social Eating tho
[3:52:04] <aiyobro> paige and pat do it for like 20 minutes
[3:52:05] <+LogothX> Some people LOVE much banging
[3:52:16] <CatmanIX> tip one for interacting with chat: read it
[3:52:16] <gunstar73> Mukbang bois
[3:52:20] <%CubicPhantom> @aiyobro notably people who are not role models
[3:52:21] <Goraka91> I will never get over how 'Social Eating' is a thing. Like what?
[3:52:23] <+paladinstarbuster> what does MUKBANG MEAN?
[3:52:32] <%mobius_won> Do the opposite of pat and Paige
[3:52:35] <aiyobro> With all the talking they do and donations
[3:52:35] <$cureneckbeard> mukbang is orcish for eating
[3:52:38] <Graxe_> You can also change the category to Real Life.
[3:52:41] <qo_op> ignore the chat. nothing good comes of chat TPFufun
[3:53:08] <CatmanIX> tip two for interacting with chat: chat LIES
[3:53:09] <laazybulbasaur> We say some funnies
[3:53:14] <%laserbeaming> Ralsei is a treasure
[3:53:19] <vexicbayn> @froyuken VRV is a streaming thing from crunchyroll with like a bunch of not anime mixed in
[3:53:19] <%GohanEgret> @paladinstarbuster apparently it's a combination of "eating" and "broadcast" in korean
[3:53:28] <%laserbeaming> Such a cute NPC
[3:53:29] <Goraka91> Ralsei is a good boy/girl/monster thing
[3:53:34] <+paladinstarbuster> Thanks gohan
[3:53:46] <%GohanEgret> wikipedia saves the day
[3:53:50] <+skylerpilot> @Goraka91 game fully recognizes him as a Fluffy Boy
[3:53:52] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> You know who also didn't like fighting? Jesus....
[3:54:00] <Goraka91> Okay good boy it is
[3:54:02] <%laserbeaming> @Goraka91 the game refers to him as Fluffy Boy, so it's safe to say he's a boy
[3:54:06] <Valentinius_Anodyne> oh no

[3:55:47] <Lieutenant_America> He didn't know?
[3:55:48] <nutimik> Yea minus just takes extra healing

[3:55:57] <+cvp5127> LUL
[3:55:57] <Psyramics> Woolie never knew that cause Woolie never did. I didn't either
[3:55:58] <aiyobro> death is enivetable
[3:55:59] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> We all can die
[3:56:01] <vexicbayn> experience minus
[3:56:01] <eggsnbakefest> @WoolieVersus Going negative on one character just means it's harder to revive them
[3:56:01] <CatmanIX> *90
[3:56:02] <+skylerpilot> you can die
[3:56:03] <%laserbeaming> You can die vs CHAOS CHAOS
[3:56:03] <caol2017> your health keeps going past 0
[3:56:04] <Lieutenant_America> Now we KNOW Woolie never fought Jevil
[3:56:04] <+velemi> you can
[3:56:04] <%CubicPhantom> i'm guessing Woolz never found the hard fight
[3:56:05] <Mr_Strut> You can die
[3:56:10] <eggsnbakefest> But if all of your characters go down, you die
[3:56:10] <+Aztec50> i think you have to party wipe
[3:56:10] <nutimik> If both are dead
[3:56:12] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Only if all party members go into minus
[3:56:12] <CatmanIX> if both characters die, you ded
[3:56:12] <laazybulbasaur> Woolz was gone for 20 seconds and shit was on fire
[3:56:12] <BeeNoons> you can die it's just health to return to positive
[3:56:13] <jase__x> you can
[3:56:13] <TooNaCly4U> you can
[3:56:13] <%king_wragles> You can die, it goes by DnD rules @WoolieVersus
[3:56:15] <Fujiwara_92> you can die
[3:56:15] <The_Letter_B_Eight_Times> Breaking the bounds of failure
[3:56:16] <subjectg> well, if you do the thing...
[3:56:16] <JanusII> You have to all be zero or under.
[3:56:16] <%stagemage> whole party has to go down
[3:56:16] <Evilkaz> If you are ALL dead
[3:56:19] <shiny_prinny> yes
[3:56:20] <+velemi> yes
[3:56:20] <Mr_Strut> ye
[3:56:21] <nutimik> Party Wipes
[3:56:21] <Hydrolion1998> yes
[3:56:22] <BeeNoons> ya
[3:56:24] <Lieutenant_America> If everyone goes below Zero, THEN you lose
[3:56:24] <Goraka91> TPK
[3:56:25] <+Zeemod155> If you're not bad at video games you can't learn everything there is to know
[3:56:26] <ProtoShawk> ye
[3:56:26] <jase__x> yes
[3:56:27] <laazybulbasaur> Yes
[3:56:27] <VorpalSlash> Only full party wipes
[3:56:27] <Fujiwara_92> ye
[3:56:28] <CuttleCrow> party members slowly auto-resurrect
[3:56:29] <$cureneckbeard> Like in FFX
[3:56:31] <%laserbeaming> Woolie woolieVS CHAOS when?
[3:56:44] <%king_wragles> Oh really? I thought single party members could
[3:56:47] <eggsnbakefest> SAVE THE DAMN CAKE
[3:56:47] <matouci> When one person dies they go into negative health and gain hp back over time until they get back to positive
[3:56:53] <aiyobro> SVC Chaos?
[3:56:56] <subjectg> only party wipes game over
[3:56:56] <+velemi> Getting negative health = dead, and you have to heal back to positive to revive
[3:57:02] <%GarbageNirvana> Mama miba
[3:57:08] <nutimik> Mama SHIBA
[3:57:10] <%CubicPhantom> eat the topcake in front of him to assert your superiority
[3:57:14] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Baker wants a Topcake because he's a Bottom bitch Kappa
[3:57:20] <%DedlokPM> @WoolieVersus when a character goes into minus life they can't do any turns until back into the positive. If all go minus it is game over

[4:01:27] <$cureneckbeard> there's a stat called Gun's
[4:01:27] <%king_wragles> GUNS TO FIFTY!
[4:01:28] <Laironx3> Duck gun
[4:01:31] <tech_nus> GUN
[4:01:42] <Goraka91> What about needles?
[4:01:48] <dabirSA> deltarun is barkley 2
[4:01:50] <Lieutenant_America> Guns are too quick
[4:01:50] <Ropcord> what if he has a syringe
[4:01:51] <@Solidus_113> Stef HATES getting stabbed
[4:01:54] <%king_wragles> What are needles but thing knives?
[4:01:57] <%laserbeaming> STAB
[4:01:57] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Does Denzel Washington as BLADE scare you?
[4:01:59] <Lieutenant_America> You can't savor all the little... emotions
[4:02:00] <tech_nus> Needles are just hollow knives
[4:02:07] <cavefishes> cuts are scarier than gunshot wounds
[4:02:11] <%Cavumentum> Ain't about the death, it's about the PAIN
[4:02:27] <laazybulbasaur> You know what is scarier than a gun or knife
[4:02:36] <Jaysky> A knun?
[4:02:38] <Lieutenant_America> More gun?
[4:02:39] <qo_op> streaming togeather is bringing out all sorts of hidden
[4:02:46] <laazybulbasaur> A big duck boi
[4:02:47] <%GohanEgret> Stef's HATE it
[4:02:48] <Ropcord> stef is weak to being stabbed
[4:02:49] <+Qsmash_> she HATES getting stabbed
[4:02:51] <+griffball13> she HATES it
[4:02:52] <gypsystranger> A bigger gun
[4:02:53] <JanusII> Getting stabbed, zero stars.
[4:02:54] <Ropcord> pat is weak to gun
[4:02:56] <+velemi> just like pat!
[4:02:58] <zeroraider> I hate getting stabbed by ducks
[4:02:59] <+cvp5127> ppl die when they are stabbed
[4:02:59] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Glory be to the duck king
[4:03:00] <tech_nus> Inst there a statistic that there are more knife kills than guns?
[4:03:01] <nutimik> stabbing usually goes deeper though
[4:03:02] <Fujiwara_92> WEAK: SLASH
[4:03:04] <+ThatGuyfromMars> D U C K D U C K D U C K
[4:03:04] <Graxe_> But Pat is weak to gun.
[4:03:05] <Fyrijou> Deltarune? More like Taleunder (ba dum tss)
[4:03:06] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I rate getting cut 0/5 stars
[4:03:06] <%king_wragles> "I hate getting stabbed" what a brave yet controversial statement
[4:03:08] <nutimik> deels more internal damage
[4:03:08] <Lieutenant_America> See, stabbing implies a deeper wound
[4:03:13] <CuttleCrow> 💋
[4:03:19] <Graxe_> Pat is even weaker to mysterious syringes.

[4:03:23] <%DeaconBluesClues> a knife is scarier but you would almost would want to be stabbed over shot. people don't understand how much terriftying damamge gunshots do on the way out of a body. they break bones, tear tissue, and create ragged holes in flesh.
[4:03:26] <Jaysky> Everyone goes duck

[4:39:50] <%QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Have you seen the final DMCV trailer?
[4:40:07] <eggsnbakefest> "Eh, you poor Al Bheds, you deserve worse dan dis, yah?"
[4:40:23] <evbites> good
[4:40:23] <Lieutenant_America> Aw
[4:40:23] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[4:40:24] <KoyFoster> Nice
[4:40:24] <%king_wragles> the last DMC 5 trailer is a huge spoiler btw
[4:40:25] <Youwereeatenbyalid> "Hey Bruddah, I don't know about these Darkners. I'm just saying, maybe we need to something 'bout them."
[4:40:27] <%laserbeaming> yeah, avoid it
[4:40:36] <+XzileGaming> he said whenever you wanted to, Woolie
[4:40:37] <Plague_Nurse> Don't let spoil it like they did with Pat
[4:40:44] <%imextremelymanly> dont watch that trailer unless you want big spoiler
[4:40:48] <LVDoomien> IIRC Woolie avoids all trailers anyway lol
[4:40:50] <Fujiwara_92> "Hey, at least no Al bheds, eh brudah?"
[4:40:55] <%laserbeaming> Iron Shackle sounds like a pokemon move
[4:40:55] <evbites> It's weird how they added tofu into dmc
[4:40:56] <Lieutenant_America> Pat was upset with the final trailer?
[4:40:57] <%king_wragles> @Plague_Nurse oh no, Pat saw the trailer and was spoiled before that stream
[4:41:03] <$KnivesEve> i dont think its very spoliery but i get what you mean
[4:41:05] <%QueequegTheater> @king_wragles Not technically. Without spoiling, that one section is ambiguously directed and the last part was already in the first trailer.
[4:41:06] <+cvp5127> not really a spoiler
[4:41:07] <%king_wragles> then some dude spoiled it for other people in the chat
[4:41:19] <%laserbeaming> Eat the moss PogChamp
[4:41:26] <%king_wragles> @QueequegTheater Fair, but it confirmed a thing that was a mystery
[4:41:33] <+temporal_zenith> @king_wragles Yeah, it always sucks when that happens
[4:41:35] <Plague_Nurse> @king_wragles I meant that chat spoiled it for people who didn't watch it during Pat's stream
[4:41:36] <%king_wragles> oh wait, I can't read
[4:41:38] <%CubicPhantom> avoid spoilers by boycotting content... a bold strategy
[4:41:46] <%king_wragles> It happened in the first one too? That's fucked
[4:41:51] <vierleger> Avoid spoilers by never learning to read
[4:41:56] <%laserbeaming> You can't be spoiled if you never watch the movie
[4:42:03] <%laserbeaming> wait
[4:42:07] <Lieutenant_America> That's a statement begging to be contested
[4:42:09] <evbites> youtube is gonna become a minefield
[4:42:15] <+JustToWatch> avoid spoilers by never experiencing anything, ever

[5:02:01] <+CourageTheCat> tsuzie
[5:02:02] <%GohanEgret> @king_wragles at the time this came out, toby confirmed there wasn't a team nor real development started, could be years

[5:02:47] <%Klefth> No it isn't. Get back in that elevator
[5:02:58] <LVDoomien> is Kris actually Rem Lezar????
[5:02:58] <+linSP> wait CHARACTER development??
[5:03:13] <%lewdskeletor13> Chara is Rem Lezar
[5:03:14] <%king_wragles> @GohanEgret I know it's pretty much a one man effort, just didn't know if there was a soft guess. It could take years though since undertale is longer than deltarune... and there's 3 years between those
[5:03:15] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @Mr_Taters\s no it's wild speculation. It seems reasonable, given Asriel comes back from college in a week
[5:03:16] <%QueequegTheater> cheer1500 Woolie and Steph, do you guys have any piece of media you absolutely love despite negative public perception? For example, my favorite Souls game is DS2 because Lucatiel's arc actually helped me get over a family member's death. It doesn't have to be a reason quite so heavy as that, but do you guys have any sort of "dark horses" of media that you feel more protective of your enjoyment of?

[5:05:08] <ElenaManetta> Is the double words supposed to be an echo, or is he actually repeating them

[5:06:27] <eggsnbakefest> Go the fuck and talk to Seam
[5:06:28] <Fujiwara_92> 3 PIECES
[5:06:29] <nutimik> You can take the portal doors

[5:06:42] <+MajorCrasher> use the doors
[5:06:43] <LVDoomien> @WoolieVersus you have to do it before you fight the next boss
[5:06:43] <subjectg> There is a shortcut
[5:06:43] <JayPastaForce> There's a shortcut
[5:06:43] <VorpalSlash> Any time before the final boss
[5:06:45] <%imextremelymanly> fast travel is an option

[5:06:54] <majindusto> Shortcuts
[5:06:55] <shiny_prinny> if you want to do it, you have to go back before the final boss
[5:06:56] <nutimik> @WoolieVersus btw you can do it after the final boss, the last save still allows to get the key pieces and do it

[5:08:32] <subjectg> you can always check it out and return to it later
[5:08:36] <ElenaManetta> The secret boss isn't worth it since you'll be dying over and over and over again. You might as well just watch a no-hit run on YouTube.
[5:08:39] <+Aztec50> the secret boss fight is also really hard
[5:08:42] <%laserbeaming> we calling it a day?
[5:08:42] <$grimpo96> showlove100

[5:08:59] <durqi> I got Key C first but I just brute-forced the puzzle
[5:09:00] <dunkledubs> You would have to do this now, anyway. You can't come back here after the boss

[5:09:15] <nutimik> good decision I think
[5:09:18] <CuttleCrow> this is a good place to stop
[5:09:22] <$Ralfclogs> anders6YADUN
[5:09:22] <%CubicPhantom> good call
[5:09:24] <NumbusPlays> I think that's probably a good call.
[5:09:24] <%laserbeaming> The bossfight is a proper super boss
[5:09:27] <%GohanEgret> chaos ... controlled Kappa
[5:09:28] <eggsnbakefest> @WoolieVersus I'll say that if you have trouble with fights in this game, the secret boss is gonna take a WHILE
[5:09:29] <$TyroneRugen> If your gonna stop now is good
[5:09:30] <silverira> its fast woolie but VERY hard
[5:09:34] <Fujiwara_92> good call wools
[5:09:35] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @woolieversus WELCOME TO HELL LOVERBOY
[5:09:35] <Lieutenant_America> Boo, but you make a logical point

[5:10:05] <%UrsulaCat> jevil is sans???
[5:10:08] <+linSP> optional bosses man
[5:10:09] <LVDoomien> *ominous carnival music*
[5:10:10] <Lieutenant_America> More fair than Sans, but still tough as hell
[5:10:14] <%GohanEgret> jevil is ness undertale
[5:10:15] <vexicbayn> no
[5:10:16] <SleepyMaribo> Sans? lol oh no... Sans got nothign on this boss lol
[5:10:16] <nutimik> a certain compact streamer beat him first try on stream
[5:10:20] <Damie904> She should at least do a first run
[5:10:21] <%Klefth> Stop
[5:10:22] <%QueequegTheater> Jevil vs. Valkyrie Queen
[5:10:23] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @woolieversus bopping soundtrack though
[5:10:23] <Zix_Serro> I can't wait for people to come to the second part first and think she's gonna start fighting Jevil.
[5:10:24] <Cluetevrelix> sans undertale
[5:10:25] <vexicbayn> and don't say anything else
[5:10:28] <nutimik> lol Sans is waaay harder than this boss dude
[5:10:28] <+skylerpilot> its way easier than sans
[5:10:29] <+griffball13> @WoolieVersus Steph first try no problem
[5:10:29] <Spydurman> beating this boss may not be possible, Jevil is legit unbeatable to a degree
[5:10:33] <dsauce999> @nutimik did he also beat dark souls 3?
[5:10:35] <startstoprepeat> it's way more fair than sans
[5:10:43] <subjectg> @nutimik i’m still very surprised by it
[5:10:50] <tech_nus> Such lies
[5:10:50] <nutimik> yea but he died to pinwheel, he GOT FUCKED @dsauce999
[5:10:52] <Spydurman> huh guess I might be wrong
[5:10:52] <%lewdskeletor13> The fight is easier than sans for sure
[5:10:53] <PainfulBuggery> LAUGH AT WOOLIE
[5:10:53] <%laserbeaming> It's fucking hard
[5:10:54] <+MisterRockett> Just do one run of him pleeease.
[5:10:54] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Yeah Woolie, let the pro do it
[5:10:55] <CuttleCrow> the pants haven't been lower
[5:10:57] <%imextremelymanly> easier than sans but still challenging
[5:10:57] <eggsnbakefest> @WoolieVersus He's got less gimmicks than sans, but he's VERY hard regardless
[5:10:59] <ElenaManetta> Sans is easier because it becomes a memory game after awhile. Jevil is mostly randomized.
[5:11:01] <Fujiwara_92> Have faith sure...
[5:11:07] <FenixSeraph> FYI Woolie DMCV spoilers are out, just be careful
[5:11:09] <$cureneckbeard> Have lucky faith
[5:11:13] <%king_wragles> back
[5:11:16] <%king_wragles> DID THEY EAT YET
[5:11:21] <CuttleCrow> Woolie just wants to practice off screen LUL LUL LUL
[5:11:21] <$cureneckbeard> no
[5:11:22] <vexicbayn> nope
[5:11:23] <nutimik> but Jevil is not that hard to do on reaction
[5:11:27] <$cureneckbeard> food cold now
[5:11:28] <%laserbeaming> The Ribs grow cold
[5:11:33] <LVDoomien> *Ominous Carnival Music*
[5:11:33] <nutimik> takes maybe a few tries, not hours like Sans
[5:11:35] <%QueequegTheater> LUL

[5:11:37] <Plague_Nurse> aww

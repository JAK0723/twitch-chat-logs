[0:26:20] <gyrobasel> Liam has the name pat banned from his stream chat
[0:26:34] <RodCU> Marduk
[0:26:38] <Parapattern> It'd be great if Liam actually traveled over to Woolie's place to say HBD
[0:26:41] <+HollowedIdjit> ARMOR KING
[0:26:43] <BelMadness> Is it Woolie birthday? Hey, happy birthday my dude! You suck at games btw lol
[0:26:54] <Doctadaking> You get armor when doing supers to power through your opponent, but if you take enough damage you'll still die
[0:26:55] <GohanEgret> no this is real, woolie
[0:26:58] <+SuichiTanaka> He's loosely based on El Santo
[0:27:00] <+paladinstarbuster> Armor king is heihaci right?
[0:27:03] <+griffball13> IT'S REAL TO ME
[0:27:03] <katocrimson> tekken: based on a true story
[0:27:04] <xdeathknightx> King is still real to me damn it!
[0:27:04] <dukenux> No, this is based on facts
[0:27:04] <+Therealmanofsteele> Anime is real and thus fighting games are real
[0:27:09] <Dutchpotato> This is a video game wifiS
[0:27:10] <MayShip> King is based on a real guy that did that tho
[0:27:10] <+KawaiiJetty> King is real
[0:27:14] <xeros720> woolie's girlfriend is confused by noted real life character, Negan, being added to tekken
[0:27:20] <+vaporousTippler> Warning: This game is canon.
[0:27:23] <pennykettle_> Videogames are real to me damnit
[0:27:25] <+KawaiiJetty> Also Tiger Mask is the shit
[0:27:26] <Snookasaurus> incineroarrr
[0:27:27] <GoogleyGareth> What do you MEAN Panda isn't real?!
[0:27:28] <+SuichiTanaka> Same base story was turned into Nacho Libre
[0:27:29] <Silverblade1991> King is based on the same guy as Nacho Libre as well
[0:27:34] <+EvilJester82> hola to @WoolieVersus and chat :)
[0:27:36] <pillowwasp> This game is canon to reality
[0:27:39] <Doplghost> but Negan is in tekken, that means its 100% real
[0:27:42] <Doctadaking> The boxing kangaroo and dinosaurs are super based on real life
[0:27:47] <denam_of_windscale> WOW BEARS
[0:27:48] <Captain_Joe1911> hola @EvilJester82 :)

[0:27:53] <axelkaspar> That Panda is WORLD CHAMPION
[0:27:54] <BelMadness> I still dont know if King is a dude with a mask or just a abomination of nature
[0:27:55] <+TsunamiPoro> they made teddy bears into a real thing damn
[0:27:56] <+MaiHusbando9S> bears aren't real, don't lie
[0:27:57] <TheFinalHazard> when's alex
[0:27:58] <GoldeNOVA> The More You KNow!

[0:28:01] <Gregorhasjoined> kangaroo was a drunk and a deadbeat dad so they axed him
[0:28:02] <dukenux> Where's Negan Kappa
[0:28:03] <+Gooniekorn> and eddy is based off of kenny
[0:28:03] <abowlofapplejacks> The Strongest Warrior in the world to you MISTER
[0:28:04] <+C0MTRYA> is this kirby level lore?
[0:28:05] <Captain_Joe1911> heart2Kkigomm
[0:28:13] <+HollowedIdjit> @BelMadness I remember there was a costume for King that made him an anthro jaguar
[0:28:14] <+horsey_sauce_> Hey Woolie and friends
[0:28:16] <Belutima> @Gooniekorn HA
[0:28:17] <VirtualMode> bryan is based off Roy Batty from bladerunner 1
[0:28:20] <sileo_patronus> Wouldn't boxing gloves hold a kangaroo back?
[0:28:22] <+SuichiTanaka> Actually, I was mistaken, it's Fray Tormenta, not El Santo
[0:28:23] <TrafficCohen> You mean DICTATOR
[0:28:24] <GohanEgret> @BelMadness the ending for tekken 3 answers that, I believe
[0:28:24] <WaxWitch> Bears you say, oh really? xcalThinking
[0:28:25] <+grandmonkbun> Kangaroo Jack 8^)

[0:28:48] <Doctadaking> Marshall Law is Bruce Lee, Lei is Jackie Chan, etc.
[0:28:51] <RodCU> Maxi is sorta Bruce Li
[0:28:52] <dukenux> see, no wonder there will be a Blade Runner anime. Japan loves that movie, it constantly references it
[0:28:55] <RodCU> lee
[0:29:01] <Novillion> does jam count for guilty gear?
[0:29:05] <+ChrisAlgoo> Jam isn't a bruce lee but she does do chinese martial arts
[0:29:08] <+Solidnick18> @WoolieVersus happy birthday dude
[0:29:10] <Doctadaking> Armor King >>> King
[0:29:13] <zamzoph> Wait, Armor King is evil?
[0:29:22] <zamzoph> Or is he "evil"?
[0:29:26] <+HollowedIdjit> @zamzoph evil as in Heel, so "Evil"
[0:29:28] <GoldeNOVA> He's a heel
[0:29:28] <+WizardofAahz> he's a heel
[0:29:31] <mojomoud> Armor King: the rare example of me liking the heel version of a character more than the face version
[0:29:33] <+PenmanLupine> I think he's a heel in wrestling but not actually evil
[0:29:39] <SirBrawler18> Good evening Sir Woolsworth!
[0:29:41] <BelMadness> Nice that Woolie gf is on the stream this time. She and Liam's gf are the only ones that doesnt take part in the videos.

[0:32:09] <spawnzie> What a heel
[0:32:10] <+Solidnick18> that's the best
[0:32:10] <mojomoud> I still maintiain that SFxT would have been great if Sony hadn't fucked Capcom over on the DLC
[0:32:12] <Josef_Stryker> NO HONOR
[0:32:15] <BourneWarrior> What A Heel
[0:32:23] <xdeathknightx> are there any ring outs we can get for the ultimate no honor? ;)
[0:32:27] <+vaporousTippler> SFxT feels weird in a post SF5 world.
[0:32:27] <+Cryomancer_Maurice> whats armor king's storym
[0:32:34] <OwlLightningMage> Did they ever fix 30, 60, 90?
[0:32:40] <mojomoud> They basically went "Either you wait 6 months to release this DLC or you can't release it on the PS3"
[0:32:42] <+Solidnick18> did woolie try marduk?
[0:32:42] <+yayaoi> apatDab

[0:34:39] <crimsonharvest> Naming yourself Marduk seems pretty presumptuous
[0:34:40] <+Poutinachos> mon dieu
[0:34:40] <+xeromage> Woolie 2024 vs Marilyn Manson
[0:34:44] <+cerass> body the birthday boi
[0:34:45] <+KawaiiJetty> Obviously Marduk's weakness is a bigger Marduk (Gigas)
[0:34:46] <Sniper_kidet> ALWAYS raw super
[0:34:48] <zackmuffin> Why is mar ducks upper body so deformed
[0:34:49] <+Solidnick18> OH
[0:34:54] <+Ssaik> Happy birthday Woolz <3
[0:34:55] <+KawaiiJetty> Jebaited
[0:34:55] <SirBrawler18> X Tekken makes me sad. I really liked the roster and the idea and gameplay concepts
[0:34:57] <Novillion> Marduke's legs look tiny compared to his top hallf
[0:34:57] <+wolvenelf> lol
[0:34:59] <beowulfx07> @spardanwarrior it was old screenshots with Jin and Ryu
[0:35:01] <Doctadaking> SLOW MO
[0:35:02] <NobuyukiJohnson> is that Jeffery McWlid?

[0:35:15] <eureka60> happy birthday my man, hope that Provigo has stocked up on Halo Top Ice Cream
[0:35:16] <kaine_west> Murduk ain't working on leg day

[0:35:18] <dukenux> Deck the birthday boy Kappa
[0:35:24] <datdemo> Remember the rveal trailer for X Tekken?

[0:35:33] <BelMadness> Woolie spamming those specials huh
[0:35:35] <Mrbaconator> that's just giant buff pat
[0:35:39] <+Poutinachos> Marduk has tiny legs
[0:35:47] <AlasterAngelo> @Mrbaconator so it's just Pat
[0:35:52] <Mrbaconator> yes
[0:35:52] <+HollowedIdjit> that seems kamric
[0:35:56] <+HollowedIdjit> *karmic
[0:35:58] <Mrbaconator> wait no
[0:35:59] <Doctadaking> Battle of the command grabs
[0:36:06] <Mrbaconator> because pat is a gnome
[0:36:08] <ppi1993> isnt liam streaming now too?
[0:36:10] <BelMadness> Woolie wish he was as sole as Marduk
[0:36:16] <+HollowedIdjit> don't we all?
[0:36:22] <NobuyukiJohnson> thats Jeffery McWild
[0:36:24] <Novillion> giant pat is still like, chest high
[0:36:24] <+Boxofwoe> I still smash buttons
[0:36:26] <CopperTucker> Big stream for Big Woolz
[0:36:30] <Neathergrasp> Is it true that crymtina Peggs Matt when they have guests ?
[0:36:30] <Gregorhasjoined> TIPS N TRICKS
[0:36:34] <beowulfx07> Remember SfxT Mike Ross playing Murduk
[0:36:36] <kaine_west> fundamentals > combos
[0:36:43] <AlasterAngelo> remember Mike Ross
[0:36:45] <NYCrownlessKing> shes asking as a casual console noob woolie @WoolieVersus
[0:36:46] <+Gooniekorn> woolie just cheated in those games
[0:36:53] <BourneWarrior> THE SECRET MOVES
[0:36:56] <BaikenAndEggs> oh god those were good times. takin notes, carvings on machines, wors of mouth, etc.
[0:36:59] <BelMadness> is no one gonna play best girl Asuka?!
[0:37:01] <+Solidnick18> miguel PogChamp
[0:37:02] <kaine_west> KBD, low-parry, SS and movement is all you need
[0:37:06] <+Baron_VonCookies> Mouth of The Liar
[0:37:17] <NYCrownlessKing> Kappa
[0:37:23] <kaine_west> Whens Lucky Chloe
[0:37:25] <+Gooniekorn> and his name was woolie
[0:37:27] <+paladinstarbuster> THE SECRET MOVES
[0:37:32] <+vaporousTippler> I remember people in school were split into Reptile believers and non-believers.
[0:37:36] <Neathergrasp> Asuka is thrash noctis is best gril
[0:37:42] <AlasterAngelo> noctASS
[0:37:44] <kaine_west> lol the FGC hustler
[0:37:56] <BelMadness> Holy fuck Noctis hair looks like crap in this game
[0:37:57] <+cerass> oof nocts facr
[0:37:57] <+RowenCleric> LUL
[0:37:59] <+ChrisAlgoo> rom the vacuous spider
[0:38:00] <Doctadaking> They used the SECRET MOVES
[0:38:03] <+Therealmanofsteele> I still remember the bullshit people used to say on the playground about how you could TOTALLY unlock whatever nonsense character in Smash Bros
[0:38:08] <katocrimson> oh look it's sasuke
[0:38:08] <mike0dude> whens 2b
[0:38:10] <+FlamingNarwhal> yeah noctis' hair is messed up
[0:38:14] <+cerass> @belmadness his face is rough too
[0:38:19] <BaikenAndEggs> the best dude at my arcade had a denim jacket, had sunglasses amd driving gloves.
[0:38:22] <+President_Miyazaki> "Garbage. Wow, that was sick."
[0:38:23] <Gregorhasjoined> KING Noctis to you boi
[0:38:34] <BelMadness> They probably just ported the model from FFXV and called it a day.
[0:38:37] <dukenux> stand by me~
[0:38:43] <Fluke_M> Except Raven could teleport
[0:38:48] <Dragonfang1337> Still can't believe Noctis skipped Soul Cal for Tekken
[0:38:48] <Fluke_M> And that was before this game LUL
[0:38:50] <iamtheTwitchghost> A N I M E
[0:38:54] <CaptainPileDriver> yo who is with woolie
[0:38:54] <+DatLatinoGuy> DAMN
[0:38:56] <NYCrownlessKing> it's good but with all the dlc @WoolieVersus
[0:38:56] <dukenux> yeyeye, give us 2bum
[0:38:59] <CaptainPileDriver> i actually don't know
[0:39:00] <AlasterAngelo> you can't beat it if it's not finished
[0:39:02] <NYCrownlessKing> it was really bad early on @WoolieVersus
[0:39:04] <+KSabot> 15 is a solid 6/10 with the dlc
[0:39:08] <pillowwasp> Who is this character from that dead game
[0:39:08] <odd_slater> It's okay
[0:39:11] <Doctadaking> It got way better, but its still not great overall
[0:39:13] <InXplotch> really, 6/10?
[0:39:19] <+KSabot> hell yeah that game is ass to play
[0:39:19] <keiji_maede> oh shit~
[0:39:20] <BelMadness> FFXV its the best FF game since FFX. Thats all I can say.
[0:39:21] <+cerass> Reggie and his gf I believe
[0:39:23] <NYCrownlessKing> its a decent 7-8/10 with dlc @WoolieVersus
[0:39:23] <seycheles> "l-l-leg day guys haha!" *has never stepped foot in gym, can't even deadlift bodyweight*
[0:39:23] <InXplotch> is 6/10 sub par for you?
[0:39:25] <+Cryomancer_Maurice> at least it wasnt 13
[0:39:27] <Gregorhasjoined> the timeskip really fucked me up @WoolieVersus , if you feel the same it may be why we haven't gone back. Shit's depressing.
[0:39:29] <JamvaanPS4> I mean IX is only like 20-30 hours and it's the best one.
[0:39:29] <pillowwasp> Put spawn in
[0:39:31] <ppi1993> ff15 is trash
[0:39:31] <+RCresham> DF2, 4 2, 2 2 2 2 2 Woolie
[0:39:31] <+KSabot> it's barely above average
[0:39:39] <+TsunamiPoro> BALLS EXPOSED
[0:39:39] <+R4dishh> atpRtsd4
[0:39:39] <dukenux> sub par to other FF maybe
[0:39:44] <datdemo> I tried the demo and did not like what I saw
[0:39:45] <InXplotch> No perfects in this dojo
[0:39:46] <xdeathknightx> Woolie is gratuit!
[0:39:50] <Neathergrasp> Can't wait for negan such hype much wow
[0:39:51] <JJCheeker> heyyy
[0:39:51] <+Hilleltaco> I can't believe Final Fantasy ripped off Azwel Kappa
[0:39:52] <+KawaiiJetty> hell ye
[0:39:56] <RodCU> Cabrón!! SwiftRage
[0:39:57] <NYCrownlessKing> better take off ur nostalgia glasses if ur trying to rate this game lol
[0:40:02] <Josef_Stryker> THE COMEBACK
[0:40:02] <+Remery_> Wish they gave us Gladio instead, I miss him :(
[0:40:18] <AlasterAngelo> if you get hit by Miguel's instant kill you have to retire from Tekken
[0:40:23] <NYCrownlessKing> and this is the question of the game in its state now, not on launch. launch was a 6/10
[0:40:23] <pillowwasp> Should’ve been Sabin from FF6
[0:40:24] <BaikenAndEggs> woot

[2:39:14] <DannyMcgee> I'm pretty sure if you do meth, you can counteract all the draw backs by eating a ton of broccoli.
[2:39:16] <bazz_tv> its like that clone high episode when the kids stop doing raisins and one say "lets do crack instead"
[2:39:18] <+phatmac16> UNLIMITED METH WORKS

[2:53:20] <bazz_tv> for what purpose?
[2:53:27] <Buka_Zero> capslul
[2:53:29] <BaikenAndEggs> getting all the stages is nothing

[2:54:45] <+SWindleFeD> Time for devour hour
[2:54:49] <+trnzero> Quick! While mods are asleep, wish Woolie a happy birthday!
[2:54:50] <+DaRoosta89> hot garbage Kappa
[2:54:52] <bazz_tv> so they couldn't turn him into a null if he loses
[2:54:56] <kaine_west> Ryu's got that hunk appeal
[2:55:06] <BaikenAndEggs> in SF6 Ryu will be like that one hobo shoto from that one obscure fighter. srink lines and flies will fly around him. super long hair and beard and his hadokens will have flies
[2:55:06] <Belutima> I just noticed Necalli had a giant V on his forehead....
[2:55:06] <+Grimlockfly> When’s G?
[2:55:17] <bazz_tv> Beard Ryu should had been his default look
[2:55:19] <pennykettle_> Mods are asleep, curse woolie
[2:55:20] <+SaltyPrime> When’s DBFZ???????
[2:55:24] <+phatmac16> Daddy Ryu < 3
[2:55:29] <supersanic94> SUPER SAIYAN NECALI!
[2:55:40] <+zanzibar_junker> Hot ryu was planned to be his look
[2:55:42] <ShinobiPhoenix> why does Necalli look like Haohmaru?
[2:55:44] <PsychoFlash1> How many more months of WoolieCurse?
[2:55:47] <BaikenAndEggs> wont be any dbfz tonight I think
[2:55:51] <candidateplays> Devour Hour
[2:55:52] <+og_lunchbox> Brought it the fuck back
[2:55:54] <animehero92> Hey Woolie. Happy Birthday dude
[2:55:58] <+SaltyPrime> No!!!!!!!!!!!!
[2:56:06] <Everpresent_Overseer> there should a modern transformers fighting game I think.
[2:56:20] <Emdhad> Not drops, Canadian resets woolie
[2:56:21] <BaikenAndEggs> @shinobiphoenix costume a capcom cup winner designed.
[2:56:25] <+cerass> blankeah
[2:56:34] <kaine_west> maaan we better play some third strike
[2:56:37] <PsychoFlash1> WOOLIE HAPPY FUCKING BIRTHDAY MY DUDE!
[2:56:39] <+projectrad> I think that's Kazunoko's choice costume
[2:56:42] <+cerass> blAnka
[2:56:45] <bazz_tv> Oh no Woolie is still acostumed to the 6 frames of lag prior the patches
[2:56:52] <+zanzibar_junker> Donkey kick
[2:56:55] <+TsunamiPoro> play smash!
[2:57:03] <BaikenAndEggs> I'm so sad that after so many years we finally have a Canadian fighter in SF and it's frrakin' Abigail....
[2:57:10] <bazz_tv> Dunkeey kick
[2:57:16] <+SaltyPrime> Always jump in on ryeyou
[2:57:18] <+Shotgundam009> vroom vroom
[2:57:27] <ShinobiPhoenix> @baikenandeggs he won with Necelli and straight up just made Haohmaru for him?
[2:57:30] <PsychoFlash1> @bazz_tv lmao
[2:57:38] <+cerass> yeah that's pretty Canada makes sense
[2:58:06] <bazz_tv> Dunkeey kick is specially effective against woolie because he is black
[2:58:06] <DrFacilier> Woolie, Matt AND Liam are streaming??? why must you make me choose
[2:58:06] <+TsunamiPoro> yo 3rd strike tho
[2:58:10] <BaikenAndEggs> @shinobiphoenix don't know if he really based the look off of Haohmaru, but yeah he made a samsho style costume.
[2:58:17] <mudai> 3rd Strike is what counts
[2:58:20] <SolSwagGuy56> Does Woolie still enjoy SFV?
[2:58:38] <ZaibatsuFan> MATT IS STREAMING SwiftRage Kappa
[2:58:40] <Sandro2584> Well time to choose between woolie and matts streams
[2:58:43] <itsya_boi_gappy> I still cant tell if i like street fighter V
[2:58:50] <BaikenAndEggs> he hasn't played sincr like August so zi doubt it.
[2:58:55] <bazz_tv> switch to blanka
[2:58:56] <+NovaKnightmare> Its been too long since I played SFV

[2:59:03] <Haarute> Remember the titty analogy Pat made, gang.
[2:59:04] <Kougsss> Why anyone would choose Matt..
[2:59:19] <SolSwagGuy56> I was so close to buying SFV and tbh I'm glad I never got in
[2:59:20] <Tampaoster> BECAUSE HE IS GORGEOUS!
[2:59:23] <+ZiphorTheBear> HAPPY BIRTHDAY WOOLIE pattyLOL pattyCozy pattyOK pattyCheer pattyChill

[2:59:56] <SolSwagGuy56> I still don't understand why Abigail was put in
[3:00:01] <BaikenAndEggs> it's a great game. but I liked 4 better.
[3:00:04] <kuningaz45> Hey Woolie when's your girlfriend joining the podcast

[3:00:30] <+Docb10> Happy birthday Woolie!
[3:00:31] <T_Sasquatch> I actually like the stage idea
[3:00:34] <abowlofapplejacks> I think it's fine for funsies
[3:00:39] <BaikenAndEggs> maybe because he fits cause of Final Fight
[3:00:50] <bazz_tv> the sad part is this stage actually has a pretty sick theme
[3:00:50] <+goose_attack_almanac> Chun Li is amazig
[3:00:54] <+goose_attack_almanac> to look at
[3:00:56] <mrlastchance1> who are woolie's friends?
[3:01:00] <T_Sasquatch> them titties
[3:01:08] <dukenux> *tighs

[3:01:24] <+goose_attack_almanac> @mrlastchance1 Reggie his friend and his fiace Steph
[3:01:29] <+zanzibar_junker> SF3 chun has bigger rack
[3:01:31] <SolSwagGuy56> SFV had a lot of ingredients to be cool but a lot of it just didn't come together
[3:01:31] <+ZiphorTheBear> woolie playing as himself, classic
[3:01:35] <mrlastchance1> ohhhhhh, well now I feel dumb
[3:01:40] <BaikenAndEggs> people get air sick from this stage? REALLY?
[3:01:42] <dukenux> this... im usually resistant to this kind of stuff, but this screen is bad
[3:01:45] <GohanEgret> reggie pls
[3:01:46] <+phatmac16> I already feel bad
[3:01:47] <+Bane_Kaikyo> I didn't know WOOLIE WAS IN THIS GAME!!
[3:01:47] <GoldeNOVA> That plane is going dangerously low
[3:01:49] <+MaiHusbando9S> gotta warn me before you put them thighs on the screen bro
[3:01:49] <+NovaKnightmare> Chun's rack size doesnt matter its her THIGH size
[3:01:56] <+Qsmash_> not air sick. motion sick
[3:01:57] <+HalfDecent_Gaming> THIGGHHHSS
[3:02:00] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah, I can imagine this being hard to look at when your focusing on the fight
[3:02:00] <ShamanKing0811> I love this stage, too bad its banned
[3:02:00] <dukenux> it's somehow worse than it goes so slow
[3:02:01] <bazz_tv> oh shit Woolie is getting powered up by the motion sickness
[3:02:04] <+HalfDecent_Gaming> ok im good now
[3:02:07] <dukenux> *that
[3:02:09] <NeroCapone> I've never played SFV before, but this doesn't look any worse than literally any smash stage LUL
[3:02:12] <ShinobiPhoenix> oh, @woolieversus Matt had some shade throwing the moment he started his stream. BURN HIM!
[3:02:23] <+paladinstarbuster> Shut up SFV is cool tho
[3:02:27] <BaikenAndEggs> @qsmash_ i still dont see it. played this stage a lot and never got to me.
[3:02:35] <333agus333> Oh shit it's a Rajang
[3:02:37] <mike0dude> i hope i get to challenge him
[3:02:39] <GohanEgret> nasty
[3:02:42] <mike0dude> i havent played this shit in forever
[3:02:44] <+HalfDecent_Gaming> its a bit jarring with the framing and also smash is smash theres a lot of bul;shit already
[3:02:44] <+ZiphorTheBear> so does necalli not have a super and its replaced with super saiyan?
[3:02:49] <+Qsmash_> @BaikenAndEggs It affects other people though.
[3:02:50] <SolSwagGuy56> I mean I like a lot of SFV's designs like Menta
[3:02:55] <SolSwagGuy56> Menat*
[3:03:09] <+Sodarar> The hats are cute
[3:03:11] <+NovaKnightmare> oh yea Happy Birthday! @WoolieVersus
[3:03:16] <wild_star_> happy birthday Woolie!!!!
[3:03:18] <etalmeta> @ZiphorTheBear the V bar and the EX bar are separate systems
[3:03:23] <kaine_west> Menat is the only good new thing about SFV
[3:03:24] <MSN04_Sazabi> Well he has a reason to throw shade Woolie, it is rather ballsy of you to stream on Matt's birthday like this
[3:03:25] <bazz_tv> wow i didn't knew Necalli's dash attack was projectile invincible
[3:03:33] <PhantomMaskJr> I’m about to call Steve dad to come whip up on y’all shotoSoon1 shotoWut
[3:03:36] <+FloorBurger> I like the stage but if people have problem with it them Im ok with it not being used.
[3:03:36] <+ZiphorTheBear> oh nvm
[3:03:44] <GoldeNOVA> Someone needs to take this pilot's pilot license away, this guy is a maniac
[3:03:45] <etalmeta> @ZiphorTheBear V is the special ability that is not a super, EX is the super bar
[3:03:46] <dmysta3000> That Wolfman alt looks rad
[3:03:52] <WaxWitch> ^
[3:03:55] <+paladinstarbuster> you never see that one
[3:03:55] <Bob8644> SSJ3?
[3:03:58] <CaptainPileDriver> now i remember why i don't play sfv online, it's because every time i go on there's always people teabagging.
[3:04:02] <+ZiphorTheBear> oh okay
[3:04:10] <bazz_tv> this alt just makes me want a new Darkstalkers
[3:04:32] <SolSwagGuy56> Didn't they confirm a new Darkstalkers or something at some point?
[3:04:42] <BaikenAndEggs> like 6byears ago yeah
[3:04:52] <+KgKid51> Chun li for Smash :)
[3:04:56] <LazyJustice1> I haven't seen that skin before and when I tabbed back in I could only think "When did they put Woolz in the game?"
[3:04:58] <+NovaKnightmare> there are rumors of a new darkstalkers due to the management change of their fighting games at Capcom but nothing confirmed
[3:05:01] <PhantomMaskJr> @bazz_tv well that ain’t gonna happen smokeSIP
[3:05:04] <bazz_tv> nah, darkstalkers resurrection was the last time capcom even mentioned the possibility of a new game
[3:05:05] <BaikenAndEggs> but Ono was the only one who pushed it. since he's not in charge anymore I doubt we'll ever see it.
[3:05:08] <KaseKaizer> I'll ask Capcom for a new Darkstalkers if they manage to not screw up the new samsho
[3:05:12] <+chrishnaw> Who are his guests?
[3:05:17] <+projectrad> A Darkstalkers game would not do as well as SF6, or SF5 Season 4.
[3:05:20] <KaseKaizer> IF
[3:05:21] <Bob8644> SNK made samsho dawg LUL
[3:05:22] <SolSwagGuy56> I hope Capcom's FGs get better
[3:05:25] <BaikenAndEggs> samsho is SNK....
[3:05:29] <KaseKaizer> dammit
[3:05:29] <bazz_tv> but Resurrection was just a compilation that aparently didn't sold well enough
[3:05:30] <+zanzibar_junker> Dark resur is great
[3:05:31] <Donk2x> I think its woolies gal and his buddy in the shit talking new vid
[3:05:35] <gyrogogozeppeli> HAPPY BIRTHDAY WOOLZ
[3:05:35] <+cerass> Reggie and his fiance
[3:05:37] <+HalfDecent_Gaming> @chrishnaw his fiance and reggie a friend he has on his channel
[3:05:45] <LazyJustice1> I mean, I'd buy a darkstalker's game before I'd by a street fighter game :P
[3:05:48] <+zanzibar_junker> Has great online
[3:05:48] <+SeagullCrushh> HAPPY BIRTHDAY WOOLIE
[3:05:54] <+phatmac16> I dont trust Capcom in making a fighting game anymore
[3:05:56] <SolSwagGuy56> I mean I'm glad Arc Sys and Namco are finally getting shine but I'd like a great new Capcom fighter
[3:05:59] <+HalfDecent_Gaming> he also scream lords and plays smash and streetfighter
[3:06:05] <LazyJustice1> Wait, since when is Necali a werewolf?
[3:06:06] <+chrishnaw> Cool. Is his fiance getting any matches in, or just watching?
[3:06:08] <KaseKaizer> that's right Darkstalkers is the ONLY non SF fighting game Capcom makes NotLikeThis
[3:06:17] <+HalfDecent_Gaming> shes just watching and reading chat sometimes
[3:06:22] <+NovaKnightmare> wait this Necalli costume... it makes him a furry
[3:06:25] <+zanzibar_junker> Iron galaxy did darkstalk res
[3:06:40] <+HalfDecent_Gaming> Called him out as darlington live on stream as well
[3:06:46] <+zanzibar_junker> Likesf3tsoe
[3:06:47] <put_hakan_in_smash> Nobody remembers Rival Schools Kappa
[3:06:51] <ScootyMcRoger> ruru
[3:06:55] <kaine_west> BLANKA-Chan!!!
[3:06:56] <BaikenAndEggs> uh... marvel vs capcom? rival schools?
[3:06:56] <bazz_tv> idk now that they have fiercer competition with Arcsys and Bamco, i feel it could be part of the redemption arc to get more fighting games franchises
[3:06:59] <+NovaKnightmare> more like Rivals who?
[3:07:01] <+Remery_> Nobody remembers Bloody Roar
[3:07:01] <+FloorBurger> Woolie is ducking the chat.

[3:12:58] <waterstealer> was it not the live one yestarday?

[3:13:16] <+paladinstarbuster> THOSE PEOPLE IN THE WATER ARE DEAD
[3:13:19] <+masta7> It’s banned because the music is too good

[3:13:44] <KinduVborrd> Happy Birthday to Woolie
[3:13:45] <juxtest> @BaikenAndEggs The water covers their feet so you cant see some attacks
[3:13:47] <OwlLightningMage> I wonder if they would put in a playable Gill
[3:13:53] <blackorchidKI2> @HalfDecent_Gaming I've only ever heard her referred to as "My Girl", so this is my first time knowing that
[3:13:54] <linkwolf4> do not talk to blanka mains. do not shake their hands. do not look in their direction.
[3:13:56] <BaikenAndEggs> makes sense
[3:14:03] <bazz_tv> he did combo
[3:14:12] <+TsunamiPoro> whens the next godzilla fighting game
[3:14:16] <bazz_tv> now he is doing combo
[3:14:26] <+cerass> this stage should power blanka up with the water and electricity and all
[3:14:26] <+zanzibar_junker> Use gaea impact
[3:14:48] <+HalfDecent_Gaming> @blackorchidKI2 There was a podcast without woolie once and he was out with steph in new zealand where he proposed to her
[3:14:51] <+SaltyPrime> Q is in 5?
[3:15:04] <KaseKaizer> G
[3:15:16] <+HalfDecent_Gaming> @SaltyPrime his name is G in this and its implied he becomes Q
[3:15:20] <+SaltyPrime> GQ?
[3:15:21] <OwlLightningMage> Q is G's clone or something. it's dumb
[3:15:23] <BaikenAndEggs> too bad it's banned, it's one of my favorite stages. great music and it's beautiful. most sfv stage are so lame.

[4:00:19] <BaikenAndEggs> Woolie ain't Pat that's for certain. we actually see many games
[4:00:23] <brambobelurkin> Im on the final stretch of p5, exams and shit though
[4:00:30] <LucidInDarkness> @Jordan_z123 Same here. I restarted because I screwed up some progress stuff
[4:00:32] <+Toynota10> can#gamechanger be an emote?
[4:00:36] <Buttface_> the fuck does Austin do for this game

[4:00:55] <Buttface_> jiyuLaw
[4:00:57] <+Ssaik> uikes
[4:01:02] <masterfire23> personas are just jojo stands on a budget Kappa
[4:01:05] <gryffinp> You know, Erin Fitzgerald is clearly capable of good performances but I can't stand new Chie
[4:01:07] <helpmeimafruit> so is chie's old voice or new voice better
[4:01:08] <+blazymaniac> P5 got me into the series, i beat P4 and started P3 but am having a hard time going through it
[4:01:10] <brambobelurkin> s'all good Spoilers dont bother me much.
[4:01:14] <zackmuffin> @brambobelurkin adachi did it
[4:01:16] <Buttface_> DPs cost blue health as well

[4:01:44] <+barretzm> @buttface_ you better beat Woolie
[4:01:47] <+VersusOmnibus> @morning_asakura You take that back... lytUSEGUN lytUSEGUN lytUSEGUN
[4:01:49] <+JayEarly> Persona 3 is really weird when you play 4+5 first
[4:01:56] <mandragoraroot> look at time nairoS
[4:02:01] <Moopoke> jivetu3Woobi jivetu3Woobi jivetu3Woobi
[4:02:05] <helpmeimafruit> I played Persona 2 after playing Persona 3 and 4 and that was a trip
[4:02:08] <LucidInDarkness> @JayEarly lol sure is rooKek
[4:02:08] <+bertiful_> jivetu3Woobi jivetu3Woobi jivetu3Woobi
[4:02:08] <BaikenAndEggs> I'm surprised (and pissed) that we got P3 and P5 dance before P5 Arena
[4:02:12] <Buttface_> @barretzm is there literally any question at all
[4:02:14] <+JayEarly> it's different in a lot of small but meaningful ways
[4:02:16] <+Jordan_z123> P3 is great but P4 and P5 add so much
[4:02:19] <+Dovakhin573> I player P3 first then 5 the 4
[4:02:19] <birdfella> [Spoiler] is da bad guy!
[4:02:22] <Buttface_> I bet he's never even SEEN Marie
[4:02:31] <+JohnMarkley> yeah there are improvements in the interface and such in in P4 and P5 that make going back to Persona 3 a little awkward
[4:02:36] <SpookyBeef7> doodMaxhype doodMaxhype doodMaxhype doodMaxhype doodMaxhype doodMaxhype
[4:02:36] <+barretzm> @buttface_ not at all. No choking tho
[4:02:41] <Buttface_> I'm gonna kick his ass and take his lunch money
[4:02:46] <CharlesRobinJr> oh wow woolie's winning as akihiko
[4:02:46] <+blazymaniac> i think P4 is the best, but P5 looks soo good
[4:03:02] <LucidInDarkness> If I can either get P3 and P4 for PS4, I'd be set. My PS3 power supply died before I could beat them. And Nocturne too rooCry
[4:03:05] <MelBrooksKA> Did Woolie take Chie?
[4:03:07] <+Dovakhin573> Music wise I think 4 is the weakest compared to 3 and 5
[4:03:09] <Buttface_> no
[4:03:16] <+noajenkk> woolie is always akihiko
[4:03:17] <SafetyBet> No way
[4:03:17] <kaine_west> Woolz is Akihiko
[4:03:18] <Buttface_> Woolie is an aki main
[4:03:19] <+Toynota10> ahhhh that was so cool
[4:03:19] <+phatmac16> P3 was my first one but P5 is dope
[4:03:25] <Chumbyf> for me is P3>P5>P4>P1
[4:03:25] <SafetyBet> Music in P4 is godlike
[4:03:33] <+Dovakhin573> Like p4 music is good
[4:03:38] <+Soul_Bruce_Lee> Woolie will take any opportunity to body someone with Akihiko LUL
[4:03:41] <Chumbyf> haven't played P2 yet
[4:03:41] <kaine_west> P3 music > P5 = P4 music
[4:03:43] <brambobelurkin> @blazymaniac p5 is very good. However its my first in the series so I cant really compare it to the others
[4:03:43] <+Weeewer> Max does 6 hours streams just in training mode...
[4:03:44] <helpmeimafruit> Woolie Verses Shin Megami Tensei III Nocturne Featuring Dante from the Devil May Cry series when?

[4:04:23] <kaine_west> i duuno reach out for the truth slaps
[4:04:25] <+noajenkk> shit, woolies looking lean
[4:04:26] <+phatmac16> P5 combat and style blow every game away
[4:04:27] <+Jordan_z123> P3 and P5 ost are just slighty better than P4 to me
[4:04:29] <+JayEarly> the first time a character refuses to go to Tartarus because they're sick took me by surprise
[4:04:29] <MelBrooksKA> \
[4:04:31] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> NO NO NO NO NO
[4:04:32] <mandragoraroot> m6kwRember woolie rembers

[4:04:43] <+Dovakhin573> And P3 still have the best final boss theme
[4:04:44] <+JayEarly> Akihiko is a boss
[4:04:47] <+blazymaniac> P5 is the king of style for sure
[4:04:49] <LucidInDarkness> @wolfofsound Some games more than others rooBlank
[4:05:04] <SafetyBet> Would you guys like to see P3 cast in the P5 Arena?
[4:05:04] <+VersusOmnibus> .... Guess nobody cares. LUL
[4:05:04] <T_Sasquatch> Ahhhh !!!

[4:05:32] <Triplicat> it's d grab december
[4:05:33] <+SiegeJay> Marie is spoilers but who care about her
[4:05:33] <+phatmac16> Kanji
[4:05:42] <+blazymaniac> to me P4 has the most fun feeling. i think the best analogy is that P4 is like the scooby do gang going on an investigation.
[4:05:43] <Buttface_> Kanji it is
[4:05:45] <mike0dude> its all them Fundamentals
[4:05:47] <+JayEarly> @helpmeimafruit your sister needs Jesus
[4:05:48] <chaozagents> Imagine an older P4 cast in P5A
[4:05:52] <+barretzm> Dgrab Dkanji time Buttface
[4:05:53] <+phatmac16> Marie is the worst

[4:05:59] <Buttface_> Marie it is
[4:06:04] <Buttface_> never mind

[4:06:35] <+SiegeJay> Marie makes me mad but they needed someone to have her persona
[4:06:37] <SafetyBet> Same
[4:06:38] <+Dovakhin573> You know who is the worst? Aegis Kappa
[4:06:40] <kaine_west> play Naoto cowards
[4:06:46] <helpmeimafruit> older P4 cast would be funny, Policewoman Chie, Ace Detective Naoto, Shopping Mall Manager Yosuke
[4:06:47] <+VersusOmnibus> @halfdecent_gaming You and everyone else

[4:07:06] <+Dovakhin573> Police woman Chie is da best

[4:07:56] <+JayEarly> @barretzm how depressing
[4:08:01] <Josef_Stryker> It's weird that Ken reached Bishie status but his voice remains the same
[4:08:01] <Buttface_> @baikenandeggs he was planned to be with Nanako as a puppet, but atlus said no
[4:08:06] <SafetyBet> Hopefully in a relation with Naoto
[4:08:07] <helpmeimafruit> SHIZAAAAA
[4:08:08] <+Toynota10> the Ken we should have gotten

[4:08:28] <chaozagents> Woolie is going full bork busters here
[4:08:34] <BaikenAndEggs> @buttface_ I'm aware. boss was mad at him, said it was a stupid idea.
[4:08:38] <Buttface_> Koro actually killed this game
[4:08:39] <+masta7> 1 not so much but 2s story is the best of all 5, but very dated gameplay wise
[4:08:40] <Triplicat> pupper snuffers
[4:08:41] <+barretzm> Koromaru is shipped with headpats
[4:08:41] <+HalfDecent_Gaming> best mascot HANDS DOWN
[4:08:44] <Buttface_> straight up
[4:08:54] <+JayEarly> I feel like Atlus are cowards for not giving Yu a canon love interest
[4:08:55] <+HalfDecent_Gaming> BORK BUSTERS
[4:08:56] <T_Sasquatch> I wish they would just port this to ps4 at least
[4:08:57] <Buttface_> evo 2015 killed this game
[4:08:59] <LucidInDarkness> rooPat ?
[4:09:01] <+phatmac16> Koro best dog

[4:09:09] <Prevot> SNUFF THAT PUPPER
[4:09:10] <+barretzm> Best boy
[4:09:11] <+VersusOmnibus> Doggo Destroyers
[4:09:11] <+projectrad> It is kind of a shame they couldn't get around to bringing this to PS4/XONE.
[4:09:17] <+projectrad> (But Arena is on BC)
[4:09:18] <+wolfofsound> pup snuffers
[4:09:18] <SafetyBet> Woolie doing dempseys Kappa
[4:09:20] <abowlofapplejacks> what happened in 2015?
[4:09:26] <BaikenAndEggs> Koromaru > Morgana > Teddie
[4:09:35] <Triplicat> wow electrocuting that doggo
[4:09:36] <+Weeewer> Friendly reminder that Ken's ult is called BAPTISM OF HEAVEN AND HELL
[4:09:36] <Buttface_> ken/koromaru won evo
[4:09:37] <+JohnMarkley> wait why is Ken allowed to use a foreign object
[4:09:39] <kaine_west> Are we forgettin Aigis
[4:09:40] <+Weeewer> Or something like that
[4:09:44] <Moopoke> jivetu3Woobi
[4:09:44] <+JayEarly> is the dog controlled with Persona buttons?
[4:09:44] <OwlLightningMage> Morgana can go die in a fire
[4:09:45] <Buttface_> in the least entertaining way possible
[4:09:45] <GohanEgret> OhMyDog
[4:09:46] <+Qsmash_> I didn't know Ken was in this game.
[4:09:49] <gryffinp> This is the guy that Pat hates right?
[4:09:49] <Buttface_> also
[4:09:54] <+phatmac16> Morgana is the worst
[4:09:55] <+Dovakhin573> Aigis who?
[4:09:56] <Buttface_> MARGARET....WIN
[4:10:03] <Buttface_> I love that bug
[4:10:09] <+ThatSamoanGuy> Oh God I miss this game
[4:10:10] <+barretzm> Ken ruined evo confirmed
[4:10:10] <BaikenAndEggs> Elizabeth best girl
[4:10:10] <Buttface_> been there for four years
[4:10:15] <bursky00> I would have preferred if Koromaru is his own fighter instead of being paired with the worst character.
[4:10:16] <+Hilleltaco> @WoolieVersus Shadows do less damage and have no burst, but they have more health, are awakened from the start, and have "shadow frenzy" in place of burst
[4:10:18] <+HalfDecent_Gaming> BORK BUSTERS
[4:10:19] <OwlLightningMage> Morgana is the worst ever
[4:10:27] <+ThatSamoanGuy> This is the only game where I can play a legit grappler
[4:10:33] <TigerClaws12> have they played DBFZ?
[4:10:35] <xeros720> Kanji is so good
[4:10:35] <OwlLightningMage> Morgana and Ken can hang out in the shame car
[4:10:36] <Buttface_> I wouldn't say legit
[4:10:40] <Buttface_> kanji sucks
[4:10:43] <+VersusOmnibus> @tigerclaws12 no
[4:10:43] <bursky00> Except shadow Chie which all damage
[4:10:45] <Buttface_> bottom 5
[4:10:47] <TigerClaws12> ah ok
[4:10:50] <+ThatSamoanGuy> Right, @xeros720 ? doodBro
[4:10:54] <Buttface_> he's fun though
[4:11:04] <kaine_west> boo misturu
[4:11:06] <+JayEarly> pourin one out for my boy Kanji
[4:11:06] <SafetyBet> This Mitsuru
[4:11:10] <SafetyBet> Holy shit that suit
[4:11:10] <Buttface_> I'm gonna bully woolie with kanji
[4:11:12] <+ThatSamoanGuy> The only other game I can sortof play a grappler is Hisako in KI. But she's a pseudo grappler, Kanji is the real deal
[4:11:13] <kaine_west> nooo
[4:11:15] <Buttface_> he's not ready
[4:11:15] <BaikenAndEggs> yeah. kanji may be my main but he's far from being a legit good grappler.
[4:11:21] <Prevot> so, if they made P5A, would it be Xrd style instead of sprites?
[4:11:21] <+phatmac16> My queen
[4:11:25] <CaptainPileDriver> yeah
[4:11:26] <Moopoke> Buttface Kanji IK him
[4:11:29] <bursky00> Mitsu is still top tier here
[4:11:32] <Moopoke> I believe
[4:11:33] <CaptainPileDriver> in vanilla 4 kanji was much better honestly
[4:11:33] <Buttface_> I'm going to
[4:11:42] <+VersusOmnibus> @prevot Maybe? Hard to say.
[4:11:44] <Josef_Stryker> I want Mitsuru to step on me :3
[4:11:44] <+barretzm> IK with Elizabeth
[4:11:45] <Buttface_> I'm also going to meaty DP him 17 times
[4:11:50] <OwlLightningMage> Shadow Mitsu is still top tier.
[4:11:52] <LucidInDarkness> rooBlank okay there
[4:11:53] <+keksisblyat> I c
[4:11:53] <RubyPilot> we in there?
[4:11:55] <+Soul_Bruce_Lee> @prevot That's team red, this is made by team blue

[4:12:01] <+treemanfour> WE IN THERE
[4:12:01] <+SiegeJay> STEP ON ME MITSURU!!!
[4:12:11] <+JayEarly> Mitsuru is still top tier after being nerfed?
[4:12:14] <kaine_west> anti-mitsuru gang
[4:12:19] <Buttface_> she's A tier
[4:12:22] <+JayEarly> that's kind of incredible
[4:12:25] <+HalfDecent_Gaming> HOLY FUCK BLONDE MITSURU
[4:12:25] <+Toynota10> ICE BREAK
[4:12:26] <Moopoke> Buttface hit him with the D Grab only
[4:12:27] <Buttface_> top 10
[4:12:27] <Prevot> Mitsuru Kreygasm
[4:12:34] <helpmeimafruit> daily reminder that the answer ruined mitsuru Kappa
[4:12:35] <RubyPilot> naoto mains lemme hear you
[4:12:37] <+phatmac16> Best girl
[4:12:46] <Buttface_> top 3 is yosuke>narukami>ken
[4:12:57] <Prevot> how come the redhead is best girl in every game
[4:12:58] <jotabranded> Persona is JoJo for kids? Those Persona look like Stands lol
[4:12:58] <kaine_west> P3 has so many good waifus and mitsuru aint one
[4:12:59] <+HalfDecent_Gaming> didnt play 3 but shes definitely my choice
[4:13:01] <BaikenAndEggs> Yosuke is a beast in this game
[4:13:09] <T_Sasquatch> my waifus in p3 and p4 are not main characters because I'm not BASIC LUL
[4:13:10] <+barretzm> True but I still hated fighting Sho the most
[4:13:15] <LucidInDarkness> @Prevot I....hmmm
[4:13:24] <+Hilleltaco> Akihiko's cyclone stuff affects his supers too, it's super cool
[4:13:25] <Moopoke> jivetu3Woobi
[4:13:27] <Buttface_> I dropped yosuke for Marie because I'm smart
[4:13:28] <SafetyBet> I mean Mitsuru is the clear winner in 3
[4:13:34] <CaptainPileDriver> looking at the lobby's boy, this game is dead
[4:13:38] <Buttface_> top 1 to bottom 7
[4:13:40] <SafetyBet> And she looks even better here
[4:13:41] <+chungyboy> ANIME
[4:13:42] <kaine_west> Elizabeth would like a word
[4:13:45] <BaikenAndEggs> Marie is really fun to play
[4:13:45] <+JayEarly> I romanced Ann I may be a basic bitch but I HAVE NO REGRETS
[4:13:49] <+FloorBurger> Mitsuru used Marin Karin
[4:13:49] <+blazymaniac> i dont really know the characters in p3, i only just beat the subway train boss. but i definately like mitsuru more than the other girl
[4:13:51] <CaptainPileDriver> EMPTY

[4:42:55] <+SirG005E> just focusing on this tiddy
[4:43:03] <Buttface_> making the max 12.5k
[4:43:03] <+SinisterBroccoli> are fighting game developers usually pretty good at fighting games?
[4:43:10] <Buttface_> no
[4:43:12] <kaine_west> no
[4:43:16] <T_Sasquatch> hell no
[4:43:16] <BaikenAndEggs> no
[4:43:18] <+RocketBarrel> no

[4:48:28] <Sofa_King_Hype> This feels like that stream of watching Yipes play Marvel 2 while sitting on the floor, minus the skill level.
[4:48:30] <+sanstus2> Yuri's one of those Nolan North types that's in damn near everything.
[4:48:31] <+Hilleltaco> Yuri Lowenthal is a lot of characters
[4:48:47] <+sanstus2> More anime than games, but basically the same sorta deal.

[4:53:55] <+sanstus2> Junpei's got a head for equivalent exchange.
[4:54:07] <+wolfofsound> How can woolie say something so controversial yet so brave?
[4:54:07] <ECRead> i never understood Junpei's baseball meters
[4:54:10] <JooseNeck> Does Vic voice Junpei? sounds like it
[4:54:14] <abowlofapplejacks> @WoolieVersus While your in PS3 land, could you make a detour to Anarchy Reigns land?
[4:54:14] <+HalfDecent_Gaming> Give me that 3rd Strikeeeee T.T
[4:54:16] <good305coolguy> him being mean at the beginning means he has an actual arc
[4:54:17] <OwlLightningMage> I'm gonna be sad if he doesn't Victory Cry BibleThump
[4:54:18] <UltimateAzure> @JooseNeck Yee, its him
[4:54:20] <BaikenAndEggs> wanted to see some high level junpei. darn
[4:54:22] <+HalfDecent_Gaming> JUNPEI IS A BITCH
[4:54:26] <+Cynacious> Like Chie. Kappa
[4:54:30] <+phatmac16> Like Ken
[4:54:30] <kaine_west> Junpei is the best, character development
[4:54:33] <Silversunburst> Junpei is good character growth
[4:54:34] <T_Sasquatch> Junpei has the best awakening moment tho
[4:54:37] <Buttface_> junpei is as good of a boy as he is trash in this game
[4:54:45] <BaikenAndEggs> Junpei x Chidori 4eva
[4:54:45] <+Toa697> junpei is just,,, not a great person
[4:54:46] <helpmeimafruit> so is junpei's girlfriend canonically dead or not
[4:54:46] <Blank9> ryuji and kanji are the better idiots for sure
[4:54:49] <Morning_Asakura> junpei is trash tier persona
[4:54:49] <Buttface_> buff my boy jiyuWhy
[4:54:54] <Silversunburst> but he is kinda crap.
[4:54:54] <ECRead> Junpei got the big tiddy goth gf tho
[4:54:58] <kaine_west> Yo Yukari is underrated
[4:55:01] <+barretzm> His girlfriend is alive
[4:55:04] <Buttface_> @helpmeimafruit canonically vague
[4:55:05] <el_patronn64> LUL
[4:55:05] <T_Sasquatch> I find mitsuru annoying
[4:55:09] <SafetyBet> Someone pick Narukami and do the Raijin Good Combo
[4:55:09] <+sanstus2> He is, much like what I assume he eats, a cheeseburger character. Not bad, but not great, and a little satisfying every once in a while.
[4:55:10] <+HalfDecent_Gaming> @WoolieVersus Ryuiji is way better Junpei!!!!
[4:55:11] <pazilla_> IK HIM
[4:55:13] <+mitchteck> I wanted junpei to betray me so I could kick his ass
[4:55:19] <+Cynacious> P3 has a good cast.
[4:55:26] <CEGold> @Blank9 I'd take a bullet for those 2 (or maybe Ryuji needs a bullet to stop shouting about the Phantom Thieves cmonBruh )
[4:55:27] <+blazymaniac> yea im in agreement with woolie on this junpei is better than yukari but worse than most other ppl that i know in p3
[4:55:27] <kaine_west> The aigis and Elizabeth disrepect
[4:55:28] <Blank9> *had
[4:55:29] <UltimateAzure> @kaine_west My fellow user evoGG doodSteve
[4:55:29] <+phatmac16> True
[4:55:31] <+SiegeJay> I thought Junpei's GF being alive is only in the FeMC ending?

[4:55:33] <umm_idunno> shinji is fucking trash tho

[5:05:38] <BaikenAndEggs> makoto color nice
[5:05:42] <Sol_Install> Makoto is best waifu
[5:05:42] <SafetyBet> Is the thought that matters @Buttface_ Kappa
[5:05:49] <good305coolguy> doesn't even make sense that a shadow would have a persona
[5:05:56] <brambobelurkin> Tae is best Waifu
[5:06:01] <+mitchteck> Napto is the right answer
[5:06:03] <Novillion> I love this Tuesday Night Fisticuffs.
[5:06:10] <+HalfDecent_Gaming> excuse you what do you have against TAE she is the fucking best
[5:06:12] <BaikenAndEggs> Squirrel tits are best tits
[5:06:13] <+phatmac16> Liz is best waifu
[5:06:14] <deviljhojho94> The best waifu is the one you like the most crikGood
[5:06:18] <Ilvocare> and I want my goddamn elizabeth character action game that they kept teasing in Arena and U
[5:06:19] <Morning_Asakura> rise is best girl don't even @ me
[5:06:21] <deviljhojho94> except for yukiko
[5:06:25] <brambobelurkin> Tae Takemi is the only correct choice
[5:06:25] <+Toa697> good, let me promise you they somehow pull it off and its amazing
[5:06:35] <Buttface_> the best waifu is your favorite unless your favorite is chie
[5:06:36] <SilverInferno3> @deviljhojho94 Heresy
[5:06:37] <+Jordan_z123> Tuesday was fisticuffs on vessel Kappa
[5:06:38] <SafetyBet> LUL

[5:06:41] <kaine_west> The person stanning for Elizabeth gets it
[5:06:48] <+HalfDecent_Gaming> lmao I really should be working on my game project due thursday night but this stream is so good
[5:06:49] <deviljhojho94> @SilverInferno3 yukiko lovers dont @ at me
[5:06:51] <SomersaultJustice> Tuesday Night Tussle
[5:06:59] <+phatmac16> Yukiko worst girl
[5:07:04] <Ilvocare> @deviljhojho94 i refuse to back down
[5:07:04] <Josef_Stryker> @brambobelurkin She's like a super close second. But it's Makoto for me. If she and her PT version didn't exist, Tae would have been my choice
[5:07:06] <kaine_west> Makoto, Chie, LIz/Aegis everything else is heretical
[5:07:14] <+Flamefish345> I’m guessing it’s Woolz birthday ?
[5:07:16] <zackmuffin> @deviljhojho94 those exist?
[5:07:20] <+HalfDecent_Gaming> yes it is
[5:07:22] <helpmeimafruit> no but yukiko has a funny laugh and it's endearing! how dare u
[5:07:31] <Moopoke> jivetu3Woobi
[5:07:35] <Ilvocare> lmao my fucking lobby avatar is blukiko
[5:07:41] <deviljhojho94> @Ilvocare Well you know what they say about Never Backing Down. You gotta wait for the sequel
[5:07:45] <+mitchteck> Man if persona 5 arena is at the game awards
[5:07:46] <Prevot> for some reason my waifu taste is exactly the same as Pat: Mitsuru, Rise, Futaba
[5:07:46] <+goose_attack_almanac> I mean I like HAru most and she's barely in the game.
[5:07:48] <+Flamefish345> Happy birth, nut of Sparda

[5:08:06] <+HalfDecent_Gaming> prolly wont be at the game awards
[5:08:06] <Ilvocare> you fool this IS the sequel
[5:08:08] <Sol_Install> Arena*
[5:08:16] <brambobelurkin> @Josef_Stryker Its the exact opposite for me. I like that Tae is her own thing, and them SP adhesives+3's. Makoto is best student choice though
[5:08:21] <+phatmac16> Fuck Pat Makoto da best
[5:08:23] <InsomniacPersona> @Sol_Install the name has already been patented iirc when it was along PQ2
[5:08:29] <kaine_west> ^^^^
[5:08:31] <Sol_Install> OH!
[5:08:34] <InsomniacPersona> or trademarked or whatever
[5:08:35] <Ilvocare> tfw @WoolieVersus will never remember me being there when he shot the fancast dead with a shotgun
[5:08:38] <BaikenAndEggs> Chie is best girl but not best waifu. a short haired girl who does kung fu that she learned from watching chinese martial art movies? whats not to like.
[5:08:40] <Sol_Install> Oh~

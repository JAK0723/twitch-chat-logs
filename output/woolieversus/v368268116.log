[2:29:56] <+Answer_Moose> @stropbopadopolis too soon
[2:30:03] <RcMacPanther22> ^^
[2:30:06] <SomersaultJustice> PULLUM
[2:30:11] <stropbopadopolis> im very sorry
[2:30:20] <jimmytwofeet> @WoolieVersus hi Woolie!
[2:30:29] <RcMacPanther22> Open lobbies after ?
[2:31:44] <KeiPrime> teleport on darun, yyess
[2:32:05] <+VektorTroika> this buzz lightyear alt color man
[2:32:26] <randomness_yo> Well that was one sided
[2:32:47] <drefizz> why dont people talk about this game a lot
[2:32:49] <+Answer_Moose> oof
[2:33:01] <Guntanks_in_Space> it does get some talk, just not as popular as others
[2:33:07] <drefizz> did this sell well?
[2:33:15] <randomness_yo> not enough big time people playing it
[2:33:41] <gatorafan> It sold dozens of copies! DOZENS!
[2:33:44] <drefizz> You can hit the tumble weed in the background!!!?
[2:33:49] <Guntanks_in_Space> 360K is the hip thrust
[2:33:54] <%PunchPlanetGame> "pelvis thrust command grab" noted
[2:34:02] <Guntanks_in_Space> and qcb qcb K is the juggle hip thrust launcher
[2:34:02] <QuincyPwns> @drefizz nothing major, much more than devs set out to sell tho
[2:34:18] <drefizz> thats good at least
[2:34:21] <+ChansonNoire> this game literally had not budget, so marketing wise it might as well be negative too, so people just dont know about it
[2:34:24] <QuincyPwns> have put out a few dlc chars for free and bringing out 3 more dlc chars, 2 of em free
[2:34:33] <Fluke_M> In fact, that boost in sales is what possibly pushed them to get a PC version.
[2:34:47] <Fluke_M> It was a gamble for Arika, for sure.
[2:35:11] <RJroy0> @drefizz It sold enough. Met their goal, but not gang busters. Just enough to make 3 more characters & put it on PC. Now more support relies on PC sales & continued PS4 sales.
[2:35:35] <MyNameIsRasus> Will Jimmy lose a round tonight?
[2:35:38] <seylumiue> SKULLO PogChamp
[2:35:38] <ElliotRyo> It's fortunate in and of itself that it met their goal if nothing else. Esp considering how little it was promoted and how high the initial price was.

[2:45:40] <RJroy0> Hayate is basically the Hayato of this game?
[2:45:58] <+Answer_Moose> I remember playing D. Dark a lot in Street Fighter EX Plus Alpha
[2:46:01] <+professor_rocket> i remember playing this on launch, it was so rough

[2:46:31] <+Answer_Moose> @WoolieVersus lets see some Garuda!
[2:46:34] <RJroy0> Have they touched D Dark yet?
[2:47:07] <+Answer_Moose> no
[2:47:10] <RJroy0> @professor_rocket I know the Beta was rough but they fixed it a lot
[2:47:19] <+VektorTroika> garuda is STRONGER
[2:47:21] <KeiPrime> blair
[2:47:25] <+Answer_Moose> YEAH GARUDA

[2:49:33] <KeiPrime> direct input controllers
[2:49:36] <wolvenelf> crab battle part dos
[2:49:36] <Guntanks_in_Space> "switching inputs"
[2:49:51] <Guntanks_in_Space> i think it's steam's controller support being borked as usual
[2:50:09] <Guntanks_in_Space> the big picture control support thing. same thing seemed to happen to neo aquarium last stream iirc
[2:50:13] <+VektorTroika> how the heck do Japanese devs code video games if their ports make it look like they've never used a pc before?
[2:50:16] <$wolf34736> cheer1 cheer1
[2:50:32] <sparrrow_> go faster woolie but take your time Kappa
[2:50:50] <+VektorTroika> lol yeah steam controller support sure doesn't help
[2:50:52] <KeiPrime> a lot of the good ports are done by different devs
[2:50:57] <stormhawk9891> Jesus that damage
[2:51:05] <KeiPrime> QLOC does like almost all the capcom ports that are really good
[2:51:06] <%linkwolf4> lytGULP
[2:51:12] <KeiPrime> like all the REs
[2:51:38] <+ssulcer> lytGULP lytGULP lytGULP
[2:51:51] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah, QLOC ports are really good. i still credit them for having the first actually playable 60FPS DmC on PC, and saving MKX from High Voltage's big fumble lol
[2:52:30] <+VektorTroika> High Voltage made one, solitary, Good Game: Lego Racers
[2:52:55] <KeiPrime> after the ZoE hd shit, how anyone could trust high voltage
[2:52:57] <KeiPrime> beyond me
[2:53:00] <%GingaNZ> woolieGASM
[2:53:20] <KeiPrime> i did like the hunter games tho on the original xbox
[2:53:26] <JumboMan214> Hey guys and Woolz
[2:53:51] <+Floofiie> What's wrong with the ZoE HD stuff? I grabbed it free for psplus
[2:53:54] <+VektorTroika> hunter games?
[2:54:08] <KeiPrime> oh PS version is fine NOW, but the original release was not ideal
[2:54:10] <UrsulaCat> don't drop your combos. half-girls are watching
[2:54:10] <Retrocop87> so despite these guys mostly being original characters to a Street Fighter game, this technically has nothing to do with Street Fighter?
[2:54:17] <KeiPrime> hunter the reckoning
[2:54:23] <+VektorTroika> Ah
[2:54:32] <+VektorTroika> WoD stuff
[2:54:37] <KeiPrime> they were liek gauntlet style games base don the white wolf pen an paper
[2:54:38] <QuincyPwns> @Retrocop87 the creator is the lead dev of sf2
[2:54:44] <QuincyPwns> was*
[2:54:47] <+VektorTroika> nice
[2:54:51] <RJroy0> @vektortroika I can't get made at Arika since they only have like 10 people on staff & their budget is like a paperclip & string
[2:54:52] <Retrocop87> ah
[2:54:59] <@SoushinSen> oh hey @KeiPrime
[2:55:04] <QuincyPwns> but it is its own franchise
[2:55:06] <RJroy0> mad*
[2:55:26] <QuincyPwns> a spiritual successor to both the sf EX series and fighting layer
[2:55:31] <KeiPrime> sup @SoushinSen
[2:55:42] <RJroy0> Like this game is SUPER Budgeted
[2:55:42] <+JacktheMan18> Man I need to get this on PC so i can play more. Shirase is so much fun
[2:55:48] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah i can't really fault arika that hard, at least they respond and recognize stuff in FEXL when they catch it
[2:55:55] <+VektorTroika> @RJroy0 fair enough. my rage is directed more towards street fighter, what with the games for windows port and whatever the heck is going on in SFV
[2:56:12] <tungstenviper> Arika really needs to put Fughting Layer characters in this game
[2:56:28] <+ChansonNoire> yo games for windows SFIV
[2:56:31] <QuincyPwns> i agree
[2:56:37] <KeiPrime> push janis for FEXL
[2:56:37] <+ChansonNoire> that shit was sick
[2:56:45] <+VektorTroika> only problem with Games for Windows SFIV was Games for Windows
[2:56:58] <Dualities> Has Woolz and crew touched SF4 yet?
[2:57:01] <QuincyPwns> if htis game is super budgeted it scares me how much was put into SFV
[2:57:06] <+ChansonNoire> gfwl actually the most well optimized version of sfiv on pc lol
[2:57:10] <RJroy0> @keiprime I mean, we only have who left of the EX cast? Ace & the Cycloids?
[2:57:33] <+JacktheMan18> This game had a lot of love put into it, so they made the budget work imo
[2:58:20] <+VariantX7> I still hope in the future we can get some fighting layer characters in a sequel or DLC for this game
[2:58:23] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah SFIV PC ran like MAGIC the way DMC4 vanilla ran on toasters
[2:58:30] <QuincyPwns> allens hurtbox falls out of htat combo ALL the time
[2:58:37] <QuincyPwns> its very odd
[2:58:40] <Guntanks_in_Space> QLOC doing SSF4 wasn't quite as good but they got better at it around SFXT onward
[2:58:44] <seylumiue> @Dualities pretty sure not yet
[2:58:46] <RJroy0> I wonder how they're gonna implement Ace & the Cycloids now that I think about it
[2:58:54] <QuincyPwns> he has a bitch hurtbox
[2:59:03] <KeiPrime> @RJroy0 i forgot if sharon got confirmed with area and terry
[2:59:05] <sparrrow_> so it's an Allen thing
[2:59:06] <Dualities> I've added 'body Woolie at SF4' to my bucket list
[2:59:11] <QuincyPwns> sharon is confirmed
[2:59:15] <QuincyPwns> probly the next char
[2:59:24] <koomikss> I have a casual lobby set up if anyone wants to play a few sets
[2:59:27] <+JohnXuandou> some moves have a juggle window, if they don't hit the person quick enough they don't juggle, Garuda Psycho Crusher is like that
[2:59:27] <koomikss> ps4
[2:59:57] <RJroy0> @variantx7 They said they'd get to them after the EX cast. But we have to keep supporting it in order for it thrive.
[3:00:37] <+VariantX7> @RJroy0 they just have to make stuff for me to buy
[3:00:42] <+primax104> I haven't seen this stage before

[3:25:32] <Guntanks_in_Space> closest we got is Hiroshi Tanahashi
[3:25:37] <seylumiue> no blocks with aggro GOUGI
[3:25:40] <eddy_bam> one more time for the ppl in the back

[3:28:57] <Guntanks_in_Space> practically a double jump
[3:29:08] <Guntanks_in_Space> though the pullum here is less oppressive than the one i fought long ago
[3:29:10] <+JohnXuandou> she has a double jump and a float
[3:29:40] <+JohnXuandou> one of her air normals she can double jump cancel too
[3:30:03] <+JohnXuandou> anti airs in this game are pretty bad
[3:30:08] <+JohnXuandou> they've tried to address it twice
[3:30:12] <KeiPrime> yeah one of her combo challenges is just staying in the air for an obscene amount of time
[3:30:21] <Guntanks_in_Space> 20 seconds i think
[3:30:26] <Guntanks_in_Space> or was it 10
[3:30:40] <KeiPrime> some DMC enemy step level of itme

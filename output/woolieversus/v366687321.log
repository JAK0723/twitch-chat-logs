[1:01:48] <Plague_Nurse> It's your catchphrase
[1:01:48] <oAznoUta> it's a good saying. let it rock.
[1:01:49] <Deadpool2450> Let it rock Woolie Kapa

[1:01:49] <%GohanEgret> just .... let it rock Kappa
[1:01:50] <$RilsRislan> We came to like the saying.
[1:01:55] <UrsulaCat> people who obsess over you might know you better than you know yourself
[1:02:02] <%CubicPhantom> remember when Pat explained how you suddenly realize that you aren't a person, you're just a collection of habits and phrases expressing itself? Yeah that
[1:02:03] <devanmuse> it's a very versatile phrase
[1:02:05] <OkamiDude15> @WoolieVersus you should've used let it rock as your catchphrase in jojo
[1:02:11] <Izuurus> woolie is kevin rudolf
[1:02:11] <AgentOrangeShoes> @rumtumtugnutz Not at all

[1:02:34] <@akuda_bar> i'm pretty sure "whatnot" is in the script somewhere
[1:02:34] <$RilsRislan> It's more like a catchphrase
[1:02:45] <$RilsRislan> I see it as the Woolie catchphrase
[1:02:52] <UrsulaCat> *sees green* cool woolie reference
[1:02:52] <Joysta> its a prosthetic

[1:58:06] <%cervidaequus> today on behind the meme: woolie vs normie gf
[1:58:07] <$RilsRislan> It's not hilarious when you point it out and explain it
[1:58:10] <%GohanEgret> this needs a pat level explanation
[1:58:19] <Laironx3> "gotcha"
[1:58:19] <+WhyIDie> it's breaking down a heavy and complicated topic into the simplest of terms, comedically trivializing the topic
[1:58:23] <realestofficialsteak> let me explain it: the girl gets vergiled
[1:58:29] <AggsMK7> You probably shouldn't
[1:58:36] <BioStormX> Just send her to the "Know Your Meme" page
[1:58:37] <%Doodle_Taco> Darn, I need to go. See you later guys!!
[1:58:39] <Worldbrand> people made fun of it because it was tone deaf

[2:34:45] <gyrogogozeppeli> LIAM WAS THE TRUE ROUTE

[2:35:28] <+StromkoPenguin> You went to the wrong location and then told TG you hung out with somebody you liked.
[2:35:29] <JDRK> the club seems blind, then you just fucked up choosing that one option with tg I guess
[2:35:29] <nobody12349> Rigged
[2:35:34] <lewdskeletor13> THE RETAIL GOBLIN
[2:35:35] <SchroedingersFerret> Give Pat his chocolate orange

[2:35:39] <+JackMillerTime> did you save then?
[2:35:41] <@akuda_bar> @WoolieVersus you can finish the game without going to the extracurricular, you just picked him TWICE instead of once.
[2:35:44] <+cvp5127> reload and skip
[2:35:44] <dragoon001914> I think Matt would be the art room, since Arts and Crafts.

[2:35:52] <DLUCKIEST> Woolie takes control and dates Pat.
[2:35:53] <lewdskeletor13> The truth is, the game was rigged from the start apatDab
[2:35:53] <RosELLo6> Yeah you picked that you liked the one who you were with the previous night
[2:35:55] <RAAAAAINMAKER> Your Anicent New Zealand War Fance was ineffective

[2:36:46] <AggsMK7> Plage would have got it right
[2:36:49] <RosELLo6> @WoolieVersus the room selections were that way to LET YOU have a scene with another character. the problem was that you told TG you were with the person you liked the night after
[2:36:49] <UrsulaCat> just play again
[2:36:50] <Jaller101514> i understood what the rooms meant
[2:36:53] <RosELLo6> so it locked you in
[2:36:54] <DarkSodaMcFaceHead> Room selection seemed clear to me. Especially with other chances
[2:36:57] <didgereedoodah> this kind of choice is super common in dating sims
[2:36:59] <DLUCKIEST> No Triangle Girl, no buy.
[2:37:01] <+Mvrdok_> Art is Matt

[2:51:34] <@akuda_bar> @WoolieVersus to be fair i think it became an in joke between rils and i when we were making final ends to your lines

[2:52:34] <@akuda_bar> @WoolieVersus the way it calculates your points, extracurriculars are like extra credits, but steph started by botching and confirmed that she wanted to hang out with liam again
[2:52:39] <%rumtumtugnutz> hung like a dwarf
[2:52:42] <+SpartanDumpster> I wanna see what's happening! Just end AD! BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[2:52:45] <Worldbrand> But you didn't get far enough with Liam anyway
[2:52:46] <JDRK> nah he meant if you chose the other thing with tg, you could swap
[2:52:47] <MyNameIsRasus> And also choosing bad choices for dialogue
[2:52:48] <Laironx3> no i regret it
[2:52:53] <+CJett92> Not on that day. It was Liam only that day
[2:53:02] <DLUCKIEST> "Didn't you hang out with me?"
[2:53:09] <+StromkoPenguin> I think those two hangouts happened on different days as well. Liam was the most recent.
[2:53:11] <@akuda_bar> that was the saying you like somebody
[2:53:22] <@akuda_bar> you could've pulled it off in the end if you hadn't done that
[2:53:23] <CptBritches> Oh no Woolie can't remember who hung out with him. He's getting dementia
[2:53:25] <dukenux> That is SBFP way
[2:53:26] <Jashter18> Best ending is harem ending obvs
[2:53:27] <Bouldus> burn
[2:53:27] <AstroFalcon09> feelsbadman
[2:53:28] <alloftheworld_1> All these years later and Steph STILL doesn't know how to pick up guys Kappa
[2:53:30] <xVivicaa> Please see it through though lol
[2:53:31] <0rond> hey akuda is there a secret TG ending?
[2:53:33] <GohanEgret> still more satisfying than a david cage game Kappa
[2:53:39] <IamGreven> promise nothing, deliver even less
[2:53:47] <ekkieekk> the bad end cut off some really cool stuff
[2:53:48] <AggsMK7> Yeah but this is funnier
[2:53:59] <DLUCKIEST> This is the best fucking possible outcome.
[2:54:00] <alloftheworld_1> It's more fitting for the stream, yeah
[2:54:02] <UrsulaCat> it's a choose your own adventure
[2:54:18] <AggsMK7> She hung out with Liam tho
[2:54:20] <Jashter18> So when is the SBF fan fighting game that is Evo ready?
[2:54:20] <ekkieekk> no you hung out with woolie the day before
[2:54:21] <JDRK> the "somebody" was the person you did extra curriculars with specifically I assume
[2:54:21] <voyagerwitch> that was on a different day
[2:54:22] <AggsMK7> It was that day
[2:54:23] <%Eaglestrike117> no but you said you liked liam
[2:54:23] <@akuda_bar> no the line was "There was someone i hung out with TODAY"
[2:54:24] <GohanEgret> you hung out with liam at home ec
[2:54:27] <+StromkoPenguin> @WoolieVersus The hangouts happened on different days, Liam was that day
[2:54:28] <+CJett92> But she only hung out with Liam on that day!
[2:54:29] <+frobeards> keyword is TODAY
[2:54:29] <ekkieekk> you hung out with liam the day in question
[2:54:29] <alrobot2014> this was immediately after the home ec room
[2:54:31] <RosELLo6> yeah someone i hung out with TODAY
[2:54:31] <NyxFang> Different days
[2:54:32] <%Eaglestrike117> cause you hung out WITH LIAM THAT DAY
[2:54:33] <gunstar73> You hung with Liam that day
[2:54:34] <%SeriousMrBlack> that's how it is on this bitch of an earth tbh
[2:54:35] <MyNameIsRasus> Woolie, she hung out with Woolie, then Liam, them you confirmed Liam.
[2:54:39] <+WhyIDie> if only the engine could detect if you rotated your saves, make that a requirement for the pat route
[2:54:40] <+Mvrdok_> @woolieversus It was Liam that day
[2:54:41] <%HossMosh> She botched it though with Woolie right?
[2:54:44] <MelBrooksKA> apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong
[2:54:57] <DLUCKIEST> I am ecstatic after that ending.
[2:55:08] <MyNameIsRasus> She also chose bad options during hangouts so that's why she didn't get Liam either
[2:55:18] <DLUCKIEST> That's true, she Warren'd Liam.
[2:55:22] <+bigb00gi3> this needs a detroit-style explosion of branching paths, clearly

[3:04:34] <Bouldus> @SubjectX07x have you not watched Pat or Paiges streams?
[3:04:36] <gyrogogozeppeli> Fairy Tail WutFace

[3:04:42] <%SeriousMrBlack> VERONICAAAAAAA
[3:04:46] <AggsMK7> I straight up don't understand the Idaho one. Is it because potatoes?
[3:04:47] <WG101> why does kirito use the best weapon in the game as his offhand?
[3:04:48] <%CEGold> Where's my RECARDLESS shirt cmonBruh
[3:04:49] <+StromkoPenguin> Pat's been living in their vents and stealing energy drinks for weeks.
[3:04:49] <DLUCKIEST> Time for sippy.
[3:04:51] <+SilverDevilfish> There's a special place in Hell for me, it's called Idaho.

[3:05:16] <alrobot2014> @WG101 maybe it uses Kotor rules and is balanced for the offhand
[3:05:18] <+StromkoPenguin> @wg101 Cuz that's how badass he is. barrSqueent
[3:05:22] <%SeriousMrBlack> that's how it is on this bitch of a shirt

[3:05:35] <@akuda_bar> @SeriousMrBlack LUL
[3:05:36] <WG101> @alrobot2014 i doubt the game is that sophisticated
[3:05:38] <alloftheworld_1> Just because someone is from Idaho, doesn't mean they'll show mercy in Idaho.
[3:05:38] <%HossMosh> @seriousmrblack hahahahahah!
[3:05:42] <+RevolverOcelot16> So can I buy these shirts or they just concepts?

[3:08:29] <WG101> RECARDLESS
[3:08:31] <umbypokochan> taking*
[3:08:35] <DLUCKIEST> @umbypokochan The biggest piggybacks.
[3:08:43] <turbofolk> these fucking shirts
[3:08:43] <%HossMosh> Holy shit it does say recardless!
[3:08:44] <alloftheworld_1> I know about Idaho, I just don't pay attention to them
[3:08:53] <%rumtumtugnutz> dumping the bucket
[3:08:57] <+StromkoPenguin> He's piggybacking her all the way to the store in -30 weather because energy drinks
[3:09:01] <dukenux> Those majin ones are the worst
[3:09:03] <DLUCKIEST> "I have two sides. Nicest guy you've ever seen and TWISTED FUCKING PSYCHOPATH"
[3:09:14] <%SeriousMrBlack> the coffee is being heated as we speak
[3:09:27] <DLUCKIEST> And there's a huge punch penis too.
[3:09:27] <%psycosis> woolieCHAN woolieCHAN woolieCHAN woolieCHAN
[3:09:29] <voyagerwitch> he has to count each individual bean give him a break
[3:09:36] <+StromkoPenguin> All of these shirts need the subtitle (I'm Autistic)
[3:09:45] <+WhyIDie> cringing so hard at these shirts that my internal organs are getting wrinkles
[3:09:46] <%rumtumtugnutz> the coffee has to get erect first
[3:09:47] <DLUCKIEST> I want one of Infinite from Sonic Forces.
[3:09:51] <MyNameIsRasus> The Goku Blue one sounds like something out of an edgy manga
[3:09:52] <WG101> @DLUCKIEST elaborate on "punch penis"
[3:09:57] <voyagerwitch> hey, what? don't use autism as an insult
[3:10:01] <+lotsofsausage> @StromkoPenguin bonus points if they're weighted
[3:10:07] <DLUCKIEST> @WG101 It's not my place to elaborate on it.
[3:10:18] <alrobot2014> woolie is obviously picking the bean out of his front yard
[3:10:23] <+StromkoPenguin> It's only funny because the person in the t-shirt is self-diagnosed and just awkward.
[3:10:28] <%BlitzChocula> the recardless one has a special place in my heart.
[3:10:41] <%SeriousMrBlack> ahhh now that's a shirt, they don't make em like they used to..
[3:10:42] <%rumtumtugnutz> smacking the python
[3:10:47] <+Shady_Zaku> When did he start streaming today, if at all yet?
[3:10:50] <DLUCKIEST> I might live in Idaho, but can I see why kids love Cinnamon Toast Crunch?
[3:10:51] <%psycosis> These are shirts Rick and Morty fans would wear
[3:10:55] <%HossMosh> I always like the weirdly specific ones that are like “don’t mess with a Supernatural fan who is from South Dakota and born in May.”
[3:10:56] <+RevolverOcelot16> These shirts just need to be sent to me. I will wear them everyday , if possible
[3:10:57] <voyagerwitch> either way, it's not a good look. it makes actual autistic folk here feel like theyre not welcome.
[3:11:01] <alrobot2014> @Shady_Zaku 7:30 EST

[3:36:24] <voyagerwitch> oh shit what if kanoko is the main villain in this too
[3:36:25] <Laicuss> SMUG
[3:36:25] <gorillahandz> you think?
[3:36:25] <dukenux> "Little"
[3:36:26] <nobody12349> She would
[3:36:27] <reonome> ya think
[3:36:28] <zepelinnn> a little?
[3:36:28] <HeavyC4> Asaru is a good guy. FUCK THE BOSS
[3:36:33] <kaine_west> she's an asshole love it
[3:36:34] <ayy_lma_o> this game doesn't seem too low budget actually
[3:36:34] <krymzen5> it looks like a passion project
[3:36:36] <gustavozxd> Dr villains don't go crazy until the very end though
[3:36:36] <GohanEgret> in fairness, that's a lot of VO
[3:36:38] <%Menitta> The faceless NPCs didnt show that already
[3:36:40] <gorillahandz> FUCKIN TRAFFIC CONES
[3:36:41] <+dopeboy_i> look like a hoodie to me
[3:36:43] <dukenux> Traffic Cones LUL
[3:36:47] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> no mouths on the models
[3:36:54] <gunstar73> I’m pretty sure this game is still early access technically
[3:36:57] <gorillahandz> It's got the style where it's most needed, and thats good
[3:36:59] <+Thorn14> Is this Nier Automata
[3:37:07] <Plague_Nurse> Looks much better than Jump Force tho
[3:37:08] <+JackMillerTime> skynet went weirder than i thought
[3:37:09] <TheyCallMeVawn> Youd prob like playing Amelia more
[3:37:10] <+hypethefool> it was made by one guy
[3:37:10] <voyagerwitch> @gustavozxd dr1 would like to have a word with you
[3:37:11] <DLUCKIEST> NEW MOVE
[3:37:15] <+VariantX7> automatic points for suplexes
[3:37:15] <Parapattern> This outside area looks budget as Hell
[3:37:19] <gorillahandz> It DOES look better than jump force
[3:37:23] <HeavyC4> he Dante + NERO
[3:37:26] <%MONSTR_UwU> woolieS woolieT
[3:37:29] <DatAsuna> It expands significantly
[3:37:29] <HeavyC4> he got BLUE ROSE CHARGED ATTACKS
[3:37:30] <%MONSTR_UwU> woolieF woolieU
[3:37:31] <Th3rd3> this is impressive for a budget title
[3:37:32] <+Thorn14> PREMIUM
[3:37:33] <%Menitta> Nice try
[3:37:34] <Prevot> anything looks better than jump force
[3:37:34] <+Clik404> is she NOT a spy?
[3:37:35] <%BlitzChocula> don't forget there's a whole other character too
[3:37:36] <gustavozxd> @voyagerwitch main villain isn't show until the very end of the game tho LUL
[3:37:40] <opethrockr55> Yeah, you'll get some new options shortly
[3:37:40] <krymzen5> i feel like i could put a few hours into it fs
[3:37:44] <voyagerwitch> no, she's "shown"
[3:37:44] <+StromkoPenguin> Is this what they do with old smart phones? Send them to die against corporate spies?
[3:37:46] <GohanEgret> m o b o r o b o
[3:37:50] <+SuichiTanaka> Visual clarity is at an all time low though
[3:37:55] <TimetodiveLTX> the punch girl is playable and supposed to be a lot more fun to play, but that's just hear say
[3:38:02] <SkitzoGamer> this game is based off a visual novel
[3:38:02] <%MONSTR_UwU> woolieVERGIN woolieVS woolieTRASH
[3:38:04] <dukenux> Yeah, atleast it seems to put its scarce budget into right places
[3:38:06] <+Clik404> look at it’s face!
[3:38:08] <Parapattern> We need MORE shit on the screen
[3:38:13] <faegbeard> PREMIUM!
[3:38:14] <%thatonestraightman> "Intruder alert! A blue spy is in the base!"
[3:38:15] <voyagerwitch> @SkitzoGamer of course it is
[3:38:17] <zafooru> wow devil may cry sure is a lot more anime than i remember
[3:38:21] <gorillahandz> I love the big CLEAR and ENEMY APPROACHING splash screens
[3:38:26] <krymzen5> yeah i have to agree. the effects are nice, but they are kinda making it hard to see
[3:38:26] <+ameer000> hopefully the briefcase can work like pandora
[3:38:27] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> A??? Baby Mode Kappa
[3:38:28] <SkitzoGamer> and actually the guy seemed like he went from making visual novels to this
[3:38:33] <$megamonmon123> @zafooru this is less anime than dmc and you know it
[3:38:34] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus you'll get new moves in like 2 rooms from now
[3:38:38] <%BlitzChocula> I kinda like that better.
[3:38:41] <dukenux> Niiiiice credit cards Asaru. Is that eggshell?
[3:38:44] <Polengoldur> assault spy? is this some danganronpa rip off?
[3:38:46] <alrobot2014> its good for blind people
[3:38:51] <Archmortal> I got here literally 2 minutes ago and I can instantly see the ways it's stiff
[3:38:54] <GohanEgret> it's like closed captioning
[3:38:55] <WG101> redacted text?
[3:38:55] <SkitzoGamer> (also this is a one man job)
[3:39:04] <gorillahandz> This game is budget, but they know how to keep it stylish
[3:39:05] <cumurasame> dangan may cry
[3:39:06] <nobody12349> The ko in Kanoko stands for koward.
[3:39:07] <+Thorn14> I like the art
[3:39:08] <krymzen5> sugui
[3:39:09] <+LogothX> is this spy fiction
[3:39:11] <gorillahandz> LOOK at this ANIME
[3:39:12] <odd_slater> I wanna know who does the art
[3:39:13] <SkitzoGamer> (best game ever)
[3:39:16] <%Doodle_Taco> Senpai=Coach
[3:39:19] <+toothpick2600> Blue protag kinda reminds me of Persona 3
[3:39:23] <alrobot2014> the art looks familiar
[3:39:28] <HeavyC4> THESE ARE ROOKIE NUMBERS. PUMP THOSE NUMBERS UP! SwittRage
[3:39:30] <gunstar73> Yeah whoever did the art is pretty good
[3:39:33] <%BlitzChocula> the life of a spy isn't an easy one.
[3:39:36] <alloftheworld_1> So the protag is basically Gill from the Simpsons LUL
[3:39:36] <CuttleCrow> he's a working man
[3:39:38] <%Ariksgabs> he's a salaryman alight
[3:39:39] <krymzen5> n-no
[3:39:40] <GohanEgret> is that montreal Kappa
[3:39:40] <dukenux> it absolutely is
[3:39:43] <DatAsuna> But not of a dog
[3:39:44] <gyrogogozeppeli> jpg Japan
[3:39:45] <zafooru> using jpgs is the new hotness
[3:39:45] <Parapattern> This is definitely bargain barrel Dang ol Grandpa
[3:39:45] <+KSabot> japan.jpg
[3:39:46] <DatAsuna> MR SHOWTIME
[3:39:47] <gorillahandz> BabyRage
[3:39:48] <voyagerwitch> asaru is like 30something right
[3:39:51] <+Clik404> and she’s got a perfect unblemished face
[3:39:55] <AggsMK7> One of these things is not like the others
[3:39:55] <$megamonmon123> 2019 the year if the JPEG
[3:39:56] <0rond> wait was that a dog or montreal?

[3:42:47] <SkitzoGamer> how bout that music tho?
[3:42:54] <CptBritches> It's more effective to attack.
[3:42:57] <Daxalog> From Behind
[3:42:57] <the7thdraconian> It's kind of catchy
[3:42:59] <+StromkoPenguin> @Ragnakawaii They are the Load, you carry them.

[3:43:02] <opethrockr55> Attack their back, it should say. Come up behind to break it.
[3:43:03] <CptBritches> Just let it rock, Woolie
[3:43:03] <+Crimson_helm> attack effectively
[3:43:05] <gorillahandz> The devs were smart to go for a business spy asthetic so they could get away with these big empty black and white rooms
[3:43:06] <切捨御免> it wants you to go around them
[3:43:07] <Laicuss> more effective to attack
[3:43:08] <OkamiDude15> hit it from the back as pat would say
[3:43:09] <%BlitzChocula> the splash on the izuna drop looks so juicy
[3:43:13] <Fujiwara_92> attack from behind wools

[3:43:21] <CuttleCrow> attack, don't not attack
[3:43:22] <Valentinius_Anodyne> If the enemy is alive, it's more effective to attack
[3:43:23] <+Nobrev> yo this game looks fuckin sick
[3:43:26] <+Thorn14> SUPER HOT
[3:43:30] <kaine_west> that DMC slowdown

[3:43:53] <SkitzoGamer> this game is really really really good
[3:43:54] <krymzen5> aesthetically it is on point

[3:56:05] <dukenux> The tasteful THICCNESS of it
[3:56:21] <+Thorn14> Yoroshku!
[3:56:25] <gorillahandz> This game seems to be a great supplement while waiting for DMC5
[3:56:30] <%Nobrev> you didnt get the ground one
[3:56:33] <+jimbobjoe1234> Can he use his tie like a whip?
[3:56:39] <KnivesEve> just came back and must ask: what is the game and why am i digging the suitcase action man

[3:56:52] <WG101> @KnivesEve Assault Spy
[3:56:53] <krymzen5> look at that shoryu
[3:56:55] <alloftheworld_1> Hoping other moves have names like "Hostile Takeover" and "M&A: MURDER and Acquisition"
[3:56:58] <nobody12349> When are the two businessmen going to fight shirtless in the rain?
[3:57:00] <+Thorn14> you got air version
[3:57:06] <the7thdraconian> I do love the idea of a character action game starring spies
[3:57:10] <%thatonestraightman> Hey Woolie, im thinking of getting into street fighter. Is street fighter V arcade edition worth buying?
[3:57:15] <+jimbobjoe1234> Reminds me of those videos in Japan where a dude would make a bunch of fighting moves while in a business suit
[3:57:18] <gorillahandz> I hope this dude gets other weapons. What would be a Beowulf equivalent?
[3:57:25] <gustavozxd> only problem that i see right now are the animations, they look very low budget sadly
[3:57:28] <%Ariksgabs> I hope those pips in the meter below are called "Stocks"
[3:57:28] <krymzen5> plus you know there's more
[3:57:28] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus word of warning that divekick is more like a dashing drop kick
[3:57:32] <Jashter18> Those tits just destroy the sub boxes lol
[3:57:37] <+cvp5127> @gorillahandz the punch girl
[3:57:38] <+jimbobjoe1234> Is that the punchgirl?
[3:57:48] <gunstar73> Only thing so far is that game seems kinda easy
[3:57:48] <gorillahandz> oh right, whole different character
[3:57:49] <+Thorn14> it's not
[3:57:51] <AggsMK7> KILL CASSHERN
[3:57:51] <DatAsuna> nah punch girl has short hair

[3:59:56] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 4 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 16oz (480mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.

[4:01:11] <gustavozxd> the enemy cycle button in dmc4 doesn't work unless you're not pressing anything else i hope they fix that NotLikeThis
[4:01:13] <Archmortal> I love the way it solves terrain issues so you don't just lose sight of your character behind walls
[4:01:18] <SlimJhm> show me your presentation!
[4:01:20] <the7thdraconian> Makes me want to kick some ass while wearing a suit
[4:01:24] <gorillahandz> After images Kreygasm

[4:02:14] <AggsMK7> Makes sense
[4:02:15] <odd_slater> Running in the 90s intensifies
[4:02:18] <mayorrev> that run is so goofy
[4:02:19] <the7thdraconian> Except sillier
[4:02:30] <mayorrev> someone put the benny hill theme over this
[4:02:30] <+jimbobjoe1234> Special skill: working while your family misses you
[4:02:32] <SkitzoGamer> no sprint only dash
[4:02:32] <dukenux> the ninja run
[4:02:35] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus You can cancel sprint lag with a jump then air dash freely
[4:02:35] <%Ariksgabs> run like you're late for your board meeting
[4:02:38] <gorillahandz> chotto on a minute

[4:10:33] <Jashter18> @the7thdraconian Honestly Xbone is pretty good controller but OG Ps2 has a soft spot in my heart.
[4:10:37] <DatAsuna> yeye
[4:10:48] <sparrrow_> try the short hop
[4:10:48] <MyNameIsRasus> KANOKO LEVELS
[4:10:50] <the7thdraconian> Really depends on what kind of hands you have
[4:10:51] <gorillahandz> game sucks refund
[4:10:51] <buster7800> CHECK THE SHOP FOR GIRL UPGRADES
[4:11:06] <dukenux> Are those real Win XP bluescreens?
[4:11:14] <kaine_west> DINO was good
[4:11:14] <the7thdraconian> I have kind of big hands, so Dualshock feels the most comfy
[4:11:20] <+jimbobjoe1234> Eat that sushi
[4:11:21] <gorillahandz> again, all for DmC combat with way better aesthetics and characters
[4:11:22] <nobody12349> Can you level Kanoko out of being garbo?
[4:11:29] <kaine_west> LB
[4:11:32] <alloftheworld_1> I think those were just makunouchi bentos
[4:11:33] <bagheadlive> you say DmC but it's actually Bayo influence because that's where DmC got a lot of it's ideas
[4:11:34] <%Nobrev> 🦀 WOOLIE WILL NEVER LEVEL KANOKO 🦀
[4:11:35] <gruib> @thatonestraightman I started (and really kind of stayed) with skull girls. Aesthetics might not be for you but it was simple to learn for me. Tutorials helped me unlike any other fighter I tried. Or Dragon Ball FighterZ. Just an opinion.
[4:11:37] <gorillahandz> SHE IS SUB WEAPON

[4:29:04] <+jimbobjoe1234> Perfectly calibrated bosoms
[4:29:06] <DatAsuna> Basically just launcher is meant to be a hold while shredder is tap, but it's a REALLY short window for hold
[4:29:09] <gorillahandz> chest so big they got their own gravitational pull
[4:29:12] <dukenux> Oppai so big it occupy entire FOV

[5:02:10] <@SoushinSen> We can see the screen's reflection from the window on the closet
[5:02:19] <+Zerodyne90> how fucking long is woolies hair
[5:02:19] <%thatonestraightman> Second part?
[5:02:20] <krymzen5> yo i just looked at the 2nd chars gameplay and she is insane!
[5:02:23] <gustavozxd> character animations are very low budget sadly
[5:02:24] <+fallen92x> its a fightstick actually
[5:02:40] <alrobot2014> a wee bit janky
[5:02:41] <sparrrow_> you can feel the low budget
[5:02:49] <+Eddy21forsaken> we can see your BIG PORNZ from the window reflection
[5:02:58] <kaine_west> back in
[5:03:02] <CptBritches> YEYEYEYE
[5:03:07] <OkamiDude15> the walk should be a slight jog/run
[5:03:08] <Fujiwara_92> Yeyeyeyeyeyeyeye
[5:03:13] <krymzen5> i'd love to see you play more
[5:03:14] <TimetodiveLTX> I wouldn't mind watching it!
[5:03:14] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> At least 1 hours
[5:03:19] <%SeriousMrBlack> are we gonna see more shoot em ups?
[5:03:21] <alloftheworld_1> I wanna see Lunar Phase get used, and Woolie's reaction while it does LUL
[5:03:28] <CptBritches> It really grew on me story wise.
[5:03:34] <+Ell1ot> chat always lies when you ask how long to beat
[5:03:36] <xeros720> well ain't nobody gonna stream this, so you'd have a monopoly
[5:03:41] <%GarbageNirvana> Good character action usually runs 3-5 hours, right?
[5:03:46] <+d00msdaydan> only 1 hour left
[5:03:47] <gustavozxd> 1 hours LUL
[5:03:49] <CptBritches> Woolie is the first human to play this
[5:03:53] <%GarbageNirvana> Cause it's about the replays
[5:04:00] <+FadingEmber> new-ish game
[5:04:01] <krymzen5> must be a bit niche
[5:04:03] <%Nekemancer> It's an infinite game
[5:04:05] <@SoushinSen> No one has beaten this game yet. WOolie, you can be the first one
[5:04:09] <Laironx3> I can see your Dio figurine. It's a sign.
[5:04:09] <gyrogogozeppeli> Woolie is actually the only one streaming it when i checked
[5:04:10] <buster7800> hope it's at least 10h
[5:04:11] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Nobody plays anime
[5:04:11] <DLUCKIEST> Just came out in october
[5:04:21] <odd_slater> I saw Foxcade do a video on this game
[5:04:22] <gunstar73> Probably cuts so new plus it’s technically still being developed
[5:04:23] <mason1196> damn those pants are sick
[5:04:23] <anarchistPastry> lmao we can see in the reflection in your cabinet
[5:04:26] <+gantz_zero> "just" @DLUCKIEST
[5:04:26] <+Zerodyne90> we can see a bit in the reflection
[5:04:30] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus when punch girl came, thye also of course added bloody palace
[5:04:30] <CptBritches> We can all see your time stop JAVs on the reflection
[5:04:37] <gustavozxd> I can see a crazy screen thing on the background
[5:04:38] <gyrogogozeppeli> WORLD PREMIERE
[5:04:38] <+dumemoto> Yo, I wanna cop those headphones
[5:04:39] <%SeriousMrBlack> it's unclear
[5:04:39] <SubjectX07x> Another interesting game that has seemingly gone rather under the radar coming soon is The Hong Kong Massacre. @WoolieVersus Think Hotline Miami meets John Woo.
[5:04:40] <OkamiDude15> guess nobody uploaded it to the site
[5:04:43] <krymzen5> dudes upload on hltb on day 1
[5:04:44] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> No one has Submitted the HLTP
[5:04:47] <xeros720> they might've just left off the ending until it got out of early access
[5:04:47] <gyrogogozeppeli> Woolie gonna be the World Record
[5:04:47] <Graywolf_the_45th> Must be a long ass game
[5:04:47] <+Toa697> this game has 100 steam revies total
[5:04:49] <Cthulos> Isn't it early access.
[5:04:54] <+Toa697> which isnt much
[5:04:56] <CptBritches> It has the hardest final boss in video game history. No one can beat it
[5:04:57] <Fujiwara_92> "oh shit you can see me in the reflection"
[5:05:01] <+cvp5127> time to look up timestop javs
[5:05:03] <%DedlokPM> @Cthulos Not anymore.
[5:05:04] <DatAsuna> Nah it's out of early access
[5:05:05] <+gantz_zero> ooooooh is it early access
[5:05:08] <+gantz_zero> oh ok

[0:11:02] <+generalve> LUL
[0:11:04] <%TheOneUpWarrior> @woolieversus wut up woolz?
[0:11:06] <vexicbayn> the troubles
[0:11:13] <+fatal_penguin_> Are you wearing pants, Woolie?
[0:11:16] <%TheOneUpWarrior> yessss
[0:11:21] <Dragon_Batman> Yea there has been some shit pushing
[0:11:27] <%dukenux> Everyone needs to git gud Kappa
[0:11:30] <+Hapsam> that kirby headset looks like kirby pooping soundwaves into woolies ears
[0:11:34] <%dukenux> so it was written... by miyazaki
[0:11:37] <mudamudajo> yo woolie! This game is kicking my ass nice and hard.
[0:11:40] <EBT93> The tip of the Platinumburg Kappa
[0:11:52] <vexicbayn> I've been inching through since last night and it's a lot of emptying your bitch cup
[0:11:53] <%TheOneUpWarrior> ran my head into a wall for 2 hrs before it clicked finally
[0:11:59] <Kyopheonix> its cuz it's not dark souls it's more like fromsoftwares old ip Tenchu c:
[0:12:04] <Dragon_Batman> At least you can start to work on them at least
[0:12:12] <%ChoculaUltra> friend of mine who works at a Gamestop in Manhattan said he's already taken 7 Sekiro returns today lmfao
[0:12:16] <%dukenux> Was thiking abotu that actually
[0:12:21] <vexicbayn> it's tenchuborne souls blood twice
[0:12:24] <EBT93> @choculaultra LUL
[0:12:34] <leviathan666303> am i late
[0:12:36] <+fatal_penguin_> I'm not a fan of Dark Souls, but how is this game?
[0:12:36] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> @ChoculaUltra atpRtsd
[0:12:38] <%TheOneUpWarrior> nightjar slash is great to get in and out of engagements
[0:12:38] <tag545> cyclopse grab from souls 2 is strong here
[0:12:44] <vexicbayn> anybidy find the moonlight greatsword yet?
[0:12:45] <MizBazz> Well you see ,if you all weren't scrubs and hopped on that Nioh train before this you would be ready for this game. Kappa
[0:12:51] <CerberusDriver> The ogre HATES fire
[0:12:55] <%dukenux> Is Sekiro really that difficult, or all the people who already got gud at Soulsborne have now trouble accomodating to different controls and gameplay
[0:13:08] <valriot> Its like Nioh x PunchOut, Nioh demands aggression
[0:13:10] <@mothmandraws> DO OR DIE
[0:13:18] <%dukenux> WE DIE IT
[0:13:18] <+generalve> you can not get greedy at all in this game man....
[0:13:25] <MattriX77> Robot arm + Katana + Grapple + Defensive gameplay = Woolie Game
[0:13:30] <+EySoyCoco> tbh the two main bosses i killed so far being agressive has paid off big time
[0:13:31] <@mothmandraws> gotta commit
[0:13:33] <Dragon_Batman> I believe
[0:13:36] <leviathan666303> this is just a better version of bloodbones parry imo @WoolieVersus
[0:13:44] <@mothmandraws> I should buy this
[0:13:48] <%QueequegTheater> Is Sekiro a character action
[0:13:52] <mayorrev> tilting is fine
[0:13:55] <+fatal_penguin_> Prepare your anus, everyones

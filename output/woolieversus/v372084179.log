[0:31:18] <333agus333> Look at this floyd mayweather lookin ass neutral
[0:31:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> fuck you *as he pokes you with a 6 foot pole*
[0:31:33] <+Troispoint> at low level, people are not going to respect your poking and your range at all though
[0:31:40] <Rhyolite_> Tager's game in unique
[0:31:46] <Rhyolite_> *is
[0:31:53] <+Tonku_the_Red> What's the difference between a hard read and a soft read, @woolieversus

[0:32:28] <MTLxSpider> LOL
[0:32:30] <+mtlwolf_> LOL
[0:32:34] <Rhyolite_> lol
[0:32:52] <%Rawklobstah88> When you play Hisako, you wait for the opponent to make a mistake. You mix em up, you lay the pressure on, you let them come to you.
[0:32:57] <haisho> Flowcharts? SHORYUKEN?
[0:33:00] <hydroarsonist69> wtf is this anime game bullshit
[0:33:02] <NarcissistCactus> a soft read is when they grab you and you knew they were going to grab you
[0:33:04] <+Tonku_the_Red> I'm writing this down. Don't lead me astray!
[0:33:13] <%Rawklobstah88> Long range pokes, teleport, counterstance.
[0:33:16] <Zanethepure> Soft read to me sounds like a read on the basis of a situation that someone was forced into very limited options and you beat them out on that.
[0:33:19] <Novillion> Here's my 12-page dissertation on BlazBlue
[0:33:26] <Zanethepure> while Hard reads are the callouts
[0:33:26] <MTLxSpider> super dash

[0:34:02] <Rhyolite_> I LOVE THIS
[0:34:04] <MTLxSpider> this
[0:34:08] <MTLxSpider> this is why i mash
[0:34:10] <MTLxSpider> and die
[0:34:12] <%Greatnumber> The goal is to not eat as many combos while forcing their own combos down the opponent's throat.
[0:34:15] <Rhyolite_> I WISH YOU DID
[0:34:15] <Fizzxwizz> yo I thought I'd see anime when I got here whats with the ted talk
[0:34:18] <CalderGaming> not shown: don't press a button anyway but get thrown

[0:34:50] <Gonewiththevoid> GRIM REAPER
[0:34:55] <kaine_west> why'd I walk into a PowerPoint presentation. I thought we was playing anime
[0:35:06] <Rhyolite_> yessss
[0:35:10] <Rhyolite_> yeeeeeesssss
[0:35:11] <wirblewomble> damn, I don't want to have to identify my personal issues just to play blazblue
[0:35:12] <+luketrapwalker> @kaine_west same, I'm here for the anime game
[0:35:13] <stormhawk9891> Or alternatively outrange him with projectiles if possible
[0:35:13] <NarcissistCactus> we're playing fighting games
[0:35:15] <Hoarseplay> I thought this was about BlazBlue, not general fighting games lecture.
[0:35:17] <gatorafan> Well... People were talking about how despite this series being called "Get into fighting games" they weren't many tips about how to do such a thing so I guess that's for them.
[0:35:29] <+GunterDriger6> this is literally amazing to watch! <3
[0:35:30] <Rhyolite_> this guy is speaking truth, dude
[0:35:30] <%Greatnumber> @kaine_west you must learn about anime, before you fight the anime
[0:35:35] <+HeartyMuffin> wife left me, now I keep jumping in on guile
[0:35:40] <NarcissistCactus> tuesday is literally fighting game day
[0:35:42] <+mtlwolf_> I dont eat during tournament time either

[0:35:53] <kaine_west> hmm interesting, the basics of the sigil fighters
[0:35:53] <MTLxSpider> TO
[0:35:56] <+michingmallecho> Food weakens the fingers
[0:36:00] <MTLxSpider> i have to eat. or i get headaches
[0:36:09] <+leviting> take out that frustration
[0:36:09] <haisho> Actual Taoist philosophy on getting all back up btw
[0:36:14] <+mtlwolf_> yes now Im a TO and I eat in front of people that are in tournaments and are hungry :)
[0:36:19] <Rhyolite_> nice woolie
[0:36:19] <Hoarseplay> @gatorafan It's literally preaching to the choir.

[0:37:14] <kaine_west> labbing is key
[0:37:15] <demitriz> I do
[0:37:19] <+mtlwolf_> LUL
[0:37:22] <wirblewomble> I love training modes
[0:37:23] <pandangerous> I love the lab Kreygasm
[0:37:30] <%Greatnumber> This is going to be a fucking hour lecture on how to get into fighting games, and I fucking love it. woolieYE
[0:37:31] <kaine_west> practice combo
[0:37:33] <%CaptainPileDriver> training is needed
[0:37:38] <NarcissistCactus> tuesday streams are supposed to be fighting game streams
[0:37:38] <stormhawk9891> But training is fun tho
[0:37:41] <PlumpPotatoRump> kbd woo

[0:37:44] <%jinking79> isn't Arcade mode training mode
[0:37:49] <MTLxSpider> deadass

[0:37:52] <NarcissistCactus> if you don't like fighting games you probably shouldn't be here
[0:37:59] <Rhyolite_> ^^^^^
[0:38:02] <hydroarsonist69> yo you're not getting casuals into fighting games with an hour long powerpoint presentation
[0:38:14] <wirblewomble> you need a place to mash out combos without getting attacked
[0:38:16] <%CaptainPileDriver> daigo practiced so much he can still do it
[0:38:20] <%UrsulaCat> @hydroarsonist69 yes they are
[0:38:20] <Rhyolite_> trust me, the enthusiasts are listening
[0:38:22] <+khalcipher> fighting games are soooooo BORING

[0:42:31] <Zanethepure> With some characters you'll be able to revolver just fine
[0:42:31] <Game_King7797> i hope he has a panel to explain anime number/letter notation
[0:42:38] <MTLxSpider> pedro aka Pochp on twitter
[0:42:39] <wirblewomble> Liam is, same thing
[0:42:45] <NarcissistCactus> number notation is just a numpad
[0:42:46] <Fluke_M> @Game_King7797 Just look at your numpad
[0:42:50] <Zanethepure> some like Bang/Kagura/Hakumen are gonna be a bit more taxing
[0:43:01] <%Solidnick18> huh
[0:43:12] <Game_King7797> @Fluke_M not for me, for people who dont know
[0:43:18] <+mtlwolf_> pochp_ *
[0:43:28] <Fluke_M> Just tell'em "Look at your numpad"
[0:43:31] <+mtlwolf_> dont forget the -> _ <-
[0:43:37] <%UrsulaCat> what's a numpad
[0:43:41] <Game_King7797> but he made a powerpoint it might as well be in there
[0:43:47] <%UrsulaCat> what's a keyboard
[0:43:53] <Brimner> cf Pog
[0:43:55] <zafooru> whoa is this a fighting game lesson stream
[0:44:04] <%Greatnumber> @Fluke_M as someone who is an idiot and has fought him before, that didn't work on the first description
[0:44:05] <SpookySpaghooti> Yea we're following
[0:44:07] <SunsetJack> 2A can chain itself 3 times for some characters.

[0:44:37] <+owo_uwu_owo_my_dude> @woolieversus hey woolz, ur nice to listen to while making models
[0:44:42] <Rhyolite_> I'm taking actual notes from this, it's so good
[0:44:44] <Gonewiththevoid> ive been playing since csex buy its still good
[0:44:53] <%UrsulaCat> I like these boy voices
[0:44:55] <RVMSpeedWagon> It‚Äôs making sense and is quite nice. Info is always great marchePray
[0:44:59] <revzero25> SeemsGood SeemsGood
[0:45:00] <ItsAbout9000> I'm learning a lot about good power point tech
[0:45:14] <A_Traitor> Sorry, but its I literally have issues retain info when its told to me, Im better at retaining when its shown to me
[0:45:15] <fallacy8> no nudity on twitch
[0:45:15] <+GunterDriger6> this is some good stuff!
[0:45:21] <NarcissistCactus> nu 12 is literally the worst nu
[0:45:23] <Rhyolite_> I'm legit sad it's coming to an end, I'm learning a lot
[0:45:23] <brows_> Absorbing through osmosis is ready.
[0:45:24] <MTLxSpider> ragna wants to go on nu. cuz he wants da ass
[0:45:40] <Aldracity> They
[0:45:43] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[0:45:45] <Aldracity> are all different characters
[0:45:47] <haisho> that's a Mu though not a Nu
[0:45:48] <DizzyNecr0> LUL
[0:45:49] <%Greatnumber> Wuh happun to the numbers?
[0:45:50] <+AirMaster> lambda-13?
[0:45:50] <Hoarseplay> Lambda 11
[0:45:50] <%Solidnick18> oh man
[0:45:51] <+Ozymandias555> Cold steel etc etc THE END HAS COME
[0:45:51] <hydroarsonist69> Is stuff like this why CoreA vids take so long?
[0:45:52] <Gonewiththevoid> ragna doesnt wants that ass cuz its his sister. kinda. like half
[0:45:52] <didgereedoodah> Mu12 best murakumo
[0:45:54] <AmanDotZip> omg are we watching him learn
[0:46:02] <didgereedoodah> to play at least
[0:46:17] <+Tonku_the_Red> Greek lettering. Lambda 11, Mu 12, Nu 13.
[0:47:05] <+Tonku_the_Red> @gonewiththevoid If he doesn't want it I'll take it. . .
[0:47:17] <wirblewomble> 5B? 5C?
[0:47:19] <Rhyolite_> wow
[0:47:20] <MTLxSpider> dash block is the best
[0:47:23] <SpookySpaghooti> Mu12 post CP is best because of her Astral
[0:47:27] <CalderGaming> "novel concept" this is why sonicfox said anime players have no neutral
[0:47:29] <Rhyolite_> never even saw it like that
[0:47:32] <Zanethepure> the invul is more region based than state based, so hitbox/hurtbox still matters, but yeah more times than not you'll AA if you scouted the jump-in
[0:47:32] <wirblewomble> I assume I missed that explanation
[0:47:32] <+Fighter_Zeta> Ayyy bureiburu
[0:47:33] <NarcissistCactus> B and C are buttons
[0:47:36] <flex_tape39> fighting games is basically a college course
[0:47:36] <MTLxSpider> neutral B.neutral C
[0:47:37] <hydroarsonist69> mr Madden this scares me
[0:47:38] <NarcissistCactus> 5 is just normal
[0:47:41] <SunsetJack> DId he explain the basic controls?
[0:47:42] <+mtlwolf_> 5B = that guy doing a kick attack
[0:47:47] <%Greatnumber> Here we go.
[0:47:48] <AmanDotZip> but we're scrubs
[0:47:48] <thatd00doverthere> oh shit woolies playing blaz green
[0:47:52] <+mtlwolf_> 5C = the girl doing that wavey attack
[0:47:52] <+johnny_volcano> @wirblewomble B and C are attack buttons, the number is the directional input
[0:47:53] <Zanethepure> notation is a keypad
[0:47:55] <+leviting> so you're saying ragna has more than jD?
[0:48:09] <MTLxSpider> are you a wizard
[0:48:15] <gatorafan> Im on phone moon2E
[0:48:20] <%UrsulaCat> I have a laptop
[0:48:36] <wirblewomble> oh right, thanks. I didn't even know blazblue was on pc tbh.
[0:48:39] <Zanethepure> numbers are directions letters are buttons
[0:48:40] <%UrsulaCat> but yeah I remember how numpads work
[0:48:40] <Fluke_M> A laptop has a numpad too
[0:48:41] <%jinking79> down 2 is the MK uppercut
[0:48:46] <MTLxSpider> james chen saying numpad bein wack
[0:48:48] <MTLxSpider> i remember
[0:48:53] <MTLxSpider> hurhur
[0:48:56] <%UrsulaCat> @Fluke_M not this one
[0:49:03] <+Tonku_the_Red> It looks like algebra.
[0:49:08] <%KingLlama1> thats why i cant play tekken
[0:49:08] <+mtlwolf_> not really
[0:49:09] <NarcissistCactus> my laptop doesn't have a numpad
[0:49:12] <supersanic94> 2H of a god
[0:49:15] <firesonicz> James chen says a lot of hings
[0:49:18] <Fluke_M> Google: "Computer Numpad"
[0:49:20] <+VektorTroika> look at your numberpad
[0:49:20] <+animecupz> james chen been wack
[0:49:20] <Rhyolite_> it's not elitist, yeah
[0:49:23] <haisho> because notations can change between games and animu is better off with number notation
[0:49:31] <+mtlwolf_> you can still google the image of a numpad
[0:49:32] <Gonewiththevoid> see: Hazamas astral
[0:49:37] <Rhyolite_> anime fighters NEED that notation
[0:49:37] <didgereedoodah> it lets us read japanese combo vids
[0:49:40] <Brimner> cmon pretzel motion is the PERFECT phrase
[0:49:40] <NarcissistCactus> pretzels
[0:49:45] <Brimner> Kappa
[0:49:46] <Fluke_M> Because numbers are universal
[0:49:51] <+GreatestGuess> Haz astral is a pretzel
[0:50:05] <Rhyolite_> it's like a language, in a way
[0:50:06] <TigerClaws12> Haz astral is a nightmare LUL
[0:50:07] <+SuichiTanaka> except some number pads are reversed
[0:50:22] <NarcissistCactus> just doing hazama's astral in a match is a moral victory
[0:50:23] <+Mawari_> and everybody dont speak english
[0:50:25] <Zanethepure> Haz astral is a pretzel like Geese Raging storm
[0:50:26] <%KingLlama1> Tagers astral = SPAM CIRCLES
[0:50:31] <+Aerodat> the short version of hazama's astral is insane too: 1632146D
[0:50:34] <+Mawari_> japan people will not use english
[0:50:36] <%UrsulaCat> no don't tell me number pads are reversed
[0:50:43] <+theAncopro> hazama is downrigth, half circle, down left isnt it
[0:51:00] <+VektorTroika> some people type on dvorak keyboards. some people are just born to hate themself
[0:51:22] <MTLxSpider> i do that a lot
[0:51:24] <MTLxSpider> jumping to die
[0:51:31] <Rhyolite_> haha yes!
[0:52:02] <Rhyolite_> "no you don't"

[0:52:55] <NarcissistCactus> noel is literally the worst
[0:52:56] <+mtlwolf_> blazblue story NotLikeThis

[0:53:00] <+VektorTroika> b l u d e d g e

[0:56:28] <DaisyFannn> @Mawari_ allo wawa

[0:56:31] <+Mawari_> but when umad ?
[0:56:35] <DaisyFannn> Kappa

[0:57:13] <Axle13j> woolie pick susanoo for green energy
[0:57:16] <brows_> @woolieversus You should change the name of this to New Fighter Approaching:
[0:57:17] <Axle13j> lup
[0:57:17] <pandangerous> play naoto SwiftRage
[0:57:19] <Zanethepure> Best question I can think of is what degree of possibility is there for revisiting games at a later date, like a repeat dive for deeper understanding, or are there simply too many games to play first @WoolieVersus
[0:57:23] <Axle13j> lul*
[0:57:25] <bignerb> that logo tho

[0:57:28] <Rhyolite_> awesome stream going on :)
[0:57:29] <%Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus how about after online matches, the player that knows the most about that character could gives tips based on what they saw in the match?

[0:58:50] <gatorafan> The barrell is bottomless
[0:58:50] <%Rawklobstah88> Ey bois, how translatable are these mechanics to other fighting games, like KI, DBFZ, or UNIST? (i know the answer, but it's important to convey)
[0:58:53] <NarcissistCactus> the barrel loops back into itself
[0:58:58] <kasparkurogane> HE'S GOT REKKAS
[0:59:02] <haisho> when's Touhou? I wanna see some jank
[0:59:06] <Zanethepure> Excellent, thanks Woolie.
[0:59:12] <NumberTooBig> did i miss bleebles
[0:59:13] <pandangerous> when's soku unlimited
[0:59:15] <Brimner> id say its translatable to most 1v1 fighters with airdashes imo
[0:59:21] <+Aerodat> @Rawklobstah88 immensely, basically everything except BB specfics can be applied to anime/airdash fighters
[0:59:25] <%Greatnumber> @NonAddictiveSlurm You missed the TedTalk, BB just starting.
[0:59:41] <+mtlwolf_> SourPls
[0:59:53] <MTLxSpider> @WoolieVersus could you lower game volume in game lol
[0:59:57] <gatorafan> KI is a very unique beast

[1:01:00] <%Nadarada> True Blue is such a good song
[1:01:01] <MasterJedi01> @WoolieVersus Why do you think Tekken doesn't use the numbered notation like other fighting games? There are some moves that involve moving back to neutral on the stick and they're represented by a "star" character in the move list.
[1:01:01] <+leviting> on a scale from anime to Aaaaaaaaanime, how Anime is this gonna be?

[1:01:18] <%Colinatlarge> @WoolieVersus Will a fighting game ever be mainstream enough to win GOTY? Or are there not enough sad dads to succeed
[1:01:22] <dj_jellocups> @MasterJedi01 Tekken players in japan use numpad notation
[1:01:26] <Scyllas> Kokonoe is bae.
[1:01:26] <NarcissistCactus> tekken doesn't need numbers because there aren't any complex inputs
[1:01:26] <Gonewiththevoid> terumi no joke my favorite villain of all time
[1:01:33] <tacostarvedbeast> if woolie pulls a fast one and just plays the story mode for 30 minutes i will declare him a god
[1:01:33] <+Cebardo> Any chance of on stream playsessions with the audience?

[1:02:01] <+VektorTroika> e for anime or e for SQUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[1:02:02] <SpookySpaghooti> @Colinatlarge I think it's definitely an "if" not a "when", the awards-giving press loves their big, dramatic narrative games too much
[1:02:02] <+Troispoint> What's more anime, BB or UNIST
[1:02:05] <Hoarseplay> No.
[1:02:06] <+goose_attack_almanac> We're big titty Squirrel girl named Makoto levels of anime
[1:02:08] <stormhawk9891> No
[1:02:09] <ShreddingPixels> no NotLikeThis

[1:02:19] <gslayer14> sad dad the fighting game
[1:02:21] <madogod> EVO needs to be hype more
[1:02:21] <Level5Chan> Granblue Versus!!!!!!!
[1:02:23] <Brimner> grandblue is gonna be nutty if the game is good
[1:02:23] <+ssulcer> You guys playing DBFZ on thursday?
[1:02:24] <NarcissistCactus> granblue is japan
[1:02:24] <wirblewomble> ÔΩÅÔΩéÔΩâÔΩçÔΩÖ„Ç¥„Ç¥„Ç¥„Ç¥„Ç¥
[1:02:29] <Sorubr0> Nah, granblue will not explode that much
[1:02:30] <+mashinchaserr> aren't there dads in granblue?
[1:02:31] <haisho> oh yeah Grandblue Versus is gonna explode for sure in Asia
[1:02:33] <%KingLlama1> @WoolieVersus what is the best advice you can give to someone whos main was nerfed or drastically changed (RIP BANG) Adapt or Dump ?
[1:02:34] <+JayEarly> Hakumen is so rad
[1:02:38] <Sorubr0> if anything, MK has that mainstream power
[1:02:40] <MasterJedi01> @dj_jellocups didn't know that thanks
[1:02:41] <gatorafan> Whats a Granblu? doodStare
[1:02:42] <+NovaStarPhantom> dbz winning goty LuL
[1:02:44] <madogod> i remember EVO 2015-2016 fighting games was hella hype
[1:02:46] <firesonicz> That's like asking if normies will stop being normies
[1:02:47] <MTLxSpider> granblue versus will have battle royale
[1:03:03] <OkNow_64> Granblue will save FGC?
[1:03:03] <%Solidnick18> granblue looks really good
[1:03:06] <RVMSpeedWagon> Lmfaooo
[1:03:08] <Hoarseplay> SF2 was a novelty because no one saw anything like it at the time.
[1:03:13] <%Menitta> I think Mortal Kombat is the closest in recent memory to that point
[1:03:20] <+phatmac16> Sf4 won goty right?
[1:03:25] <hydroarsonist69> @WoolieVersus are powerpoints like that the reason that CoreA Gaming uploads once a month
[1:03:26] <Gonewiththevoid> granblue if anything else will look good as hell
[1:03:26] <%Menitta> MK has a huuuuge casual following
[1:03:33] <%Rawklobstah88> DBFZ got REAL close
[1:03:40] <%Menitta> DBFZ did as well yeah
[1:03:56] <wirblewomble> Virtua Fighter 6, just you wait :')
[1:03:57] <MTLxSpider> dbfz had every community pickup the game
[1:04:00] <MTLxSpider> it was something
[1:04:07] <madogod> Fighting games requires too much skill imo
[1:04:11] <OkNow_64> Smash might win goty
[1:04:16] <Cymen90> Unpopular Opinion: The only fighting games that will ever be MAINSTREAM POPULAR will have a zero entry level for inputs.
[1:04:23] <hydroarsonist69> smash ultimate would probably be the best chance the FGC has
[1:04:25] <+Mawari_> Football ? You mean soccer Kappa
[1:04:29] <kasparkurogane> blade strangers is never gonna be mainstream popular
[1:04:36] <+Troispoint> Cymen90 MK and SF aren't that braindead and they're mainstream
[1:04:38] <Twoiis> The popular one will have to have a big brand name attached.
[1:04:43] <%Solidus_113> look at this fresh install
[1:04:45] <Cymen90> Hell, For Honor has a bigger playerbase than any "real" fighting game.
[1:04:50] <+ChansonNoire> >Cymen90: Unpopular Opinion: The only fighting games that will ever be MAINSTREAM POPULAR will have a zero entry level for inputs.
[1:04:54] <+ChansonNoire> talking about smash? Kappa
[1:04:57] <MTLxSpider> lmao
[1:05:02] <%UrsulaCat> simple and easy is the way that you're making me

[1:06:33] <Cymen90> @Troispoint Perhaps but I really didn't like Rising Thunder. It reduced input difficulty but kept all the other fighting game bullshit.
[1:06:37] <hydroarsonist69> bang is just buff Joseph Joestar
[1:06:37] <%Fighter_Zeta> Hibiki feels more like a ninja character than Bang tbh
[1:06:40] <FatDragonQuest> I know this keeps getting asked but what do I do when someone tells me that I should stop playing a character? I've been enjoying SC6 as Nightmare because I like his toolkit but a few people have told me that Nightmare is for scrubs and I should change to someone else
[1:06:41] <Brimner> hibiki for fun ninja character
[1:06:41] <didgereedoodah> SUSANOOH

[1:07:38] <Smileyhat> @WoolieVersus I got a couple questions I'll throw at you one at a time. When I play fighting games I find myself concentrating so much on what I'm doing that I have a hard time actively thinking about and trying to predict what my opponent's going to do. Is there any advice you could give as far as learning to give more active thought to strategy in the middle of a match?
[1:07:39] <Brimner> jk tho soos is dope
[1:07:42] <+ChansonNoire> "HE'S GREEN" -woolie LUL

[1:12:43] <SunsetJack> Susanooh has an all might color alt
[1:12:43] <kasparkurogane> so if you do the first hit of gauntlet hades (214B) you can do 214D afterwards
[1:12:55] <dj_jellocups> MASH C FOR LIGHTNING
[1:12:57] <Cymen90> @Dat_Guy_SLaTeR Hate the feel of it. Hate the look of it. Dislike the Trigger Mechanics.

[1:13:15] <didgereedoodah> yeah overdrive combos
[1:13:23] <Game_King7797> woolie canon the strongest
[1:13:26] <+leviting> audio seems a bit late
[1:13:27] <Level5Chan> this is really fun to watch
[1:13:42] <%Zanethepure> @WoolieVersus just so you know, Susano'o has all of his specials in Overdrive
[1:13:46] <waifoong98> Overdrive is basically Soul Charge in SCVI in simple terms
[1:13:50] <NarcissistCactus> SourPls
[1:13:50] <ConeCorvid> doodOne doodOne
[1:14:14] <+mashinchaserr> SourPls
[1:14:15] <Forester_Skippy> dont forget you can use OD again to do a super that eats your remaining OD time

[1:14:59] <Boogius> 6A rc 6A the gun
[1:15:00] <Brimner> 6a rc 6a rc 6a is a true mans combo btw
[1:15:17] <NarcissistCactus> I wanted to main susanoo but I was too lazy to finish the story mode
[1:15:20] <%Zanethepure> 6A>4D on hit is really good to know for Susan
[1:15:27] <Game_King7797> PURPLE GRAB
[1:15:30] <Dat_Guy_SLaTeR> is this blazblu extended?
[1:15:36] <didgereedoodah> the purple throw
[1:15:40] <Festtag> Wooly do a flashkick with D while in overdrive, it unlocks all of your moves
[1:15:43] <pandangerous> the purple throw NotLikeThis
[1:15:48] <kasparkurogane> also 6B with susanoo is +4 on block
[1:15:50] <MTLxSpider> ITS OKAY REGGIE YOU WONT DO 10 PUSHPS
[1:15:55] <NumberTooBig> so do you play Susanoo with loadouts of specials in mind or could you safely wing it
[1:16:07] <%Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus Makoto is a real punch girl, Bullet is more of a grappler
[1:16:12] <nutimik> Yeee Bullet
[1:16:15] <+Aerodat> either @nonaddictiveslurm
[1:16:18] <dj_jellocups> Try Izanami for the best super in the game
[1:16:27] <el_patronn64> Lol
[1:16:29] <waifoong98> Bullet needs time lock on @WoolieVersus
[1:16:33] <+GreatestGuess> Most Susan players go for dp first
[1:16:34] <SpookySpaghooti> @NonAddictiveSlurm ideally you want all the specials cuz you get access to a really strong DD if you have them all
[1:16:36] <+mistahveer> What's stuff like +4 on block mean?
[1:16:36] <Game_King7797> he doesnt have all the colors im assuming
[1:16:37] <pandangerous> you can wing it but you can skip some hits in multi hit moves to land on specific specials
[1:16:43] <silfa144> octoLewd
[1:16:43] <GuigolsS> @WoolieVersus are you guys going to play UNIST?
[1:16:51] <%Zanethepure> Bullet is Grab and punch gal
[1:16:54] <Festtag> "You should play this Top Tier against woolies bottom tier"
[1:16:56] <+FloorBurger> Yo Bullet though.
[1:16:57] <blackorchidKI2> Butt foss Kreygasm
[1:17:00] <lovesosa236> Must Die is the best song

[1:17:23] <+yuiyui984> Cool, UNIST is fun
[1:17:25] <+TruSpindash> SourPls
[1:17:25] <%UrsulaCat> rebel 1
[1:17:27] <reyntime180> @mistahveer being +4 on block means that you recover 4 frames quicker than the opponent
[1:17:33] <Game_King7797> i've never seen this bullet color i like it
[1:17:34] <+Cebardo> AComptonG u right
[1:17:42] <reyntime180> usually meaning that you can continue pressure
[1:17:44] <SpookySpaghooti> Bullet's theme is pretty good
[1:17:46] <+mtlwolf_> LOL
[1:17:49] <TigerClaws12> the self mix up LUL
[1:17:52] <NumberTooBig> @AComptonG well GG Xrd is still current, but i like playing Unist better LUL
[1:17:53] <%Solidnick18> that's a charge
[1:17:53] <+mistahveer> Thanks!
[1:17:53] <pandangerous> where are the snap hands fist loops SwiftRage
[1:17:54] <ConeCorvid> lol
[1:18:00] <%Solidnick18> oh no
[1:18:05] <lovesosa236> all songs are great but I love ones with lyrics even tho must die lyrics dont make any sense
[1:18:09] <%Zanethepure> Bullet is the suffering life
[1:18:09] <waifoong98> Playing against izayoi LUL
[1:18:10] <Brimner> snap hand loops are so painful to do
[1:18:11] <KaironFortressKnight> Izayoi activated her GN drives.
[1:18:12] <+mashinchaserr> the takeback
[1:18:13] <%Solidus_113> learn how to blaze up
[1:18:13] <Festtag> Not all songs are great
[1:18:16] <+mtlwolf_> I told you she was a mix of ryu and cammy
[1:18:16] <Festtag> that' is super wrong
[1:18:20] <Festtag> Black Onslaught is horrible
[1:18:23] <%Zanethepure> HCF actually
[1:18:27] <Aldracity> it's HCF C
[1:18:31] <+mtlwolf_> normal mode you basically fireball + antiair
[1:18:40] <+mtlwolf_> in GA you knockdown + mixup
[1:18:40] <CalderGaming> 41236C
[1:18:42] <AComptonG> GG still dope unist is just more fun for a n00b like myself
[1:18:48] <wirblewomble> are those projectiles a normal?
[1:18:51] <%Greatnumber> BIGGER D
[1:18:51] <+pr0at> atpRtsd3 atpRtsd4

[1:19:01] <%Colinatlarge> woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM
[1:19:02] <MTLxSpider> @mistahveer usually fighitng games run at 60fps when a move is + on block. it means if they recover faster than you on block. +4 means recovers 4 frame faster than you do.
[1:19:07] <yourbuddycarl> @wirblewomble no
[1:19:08] <$FuqBoiSlim> big d Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:19:23] <wirblewomble> @yourbuddycarl oh good, that would be busted
[1:19:31] <CalderGaming> followup 41236C with 236C when charged
[1:19:40] <CalderGaming> sorry 236D
[1:19:50] <yourbuddycarl> @wirblewomble trust me Izayoi is nasty go look up skd playing her
[1:19:50] <+FloorBurger> You can see Woolie getting a big D during the match.
[1:19:51] <lovesosa236> I want this to get the guilty gear dbfz treatment
[1:20:03] <MTLxSpider> recover 4 frame fasters. recover meaning number of frame you are able to move again.
[1:20:16] <+mistahveer> gotcha thanks
[1:20:17] <cjsugar> Who's with Woolie rn?
[1:20:20] <Dat_Guy_SLaTeR> @lovesosa236 what treatment?
[1:20:25] <%Greatnumber> @cjsugar Reggie and Pedro
[1:20:26] <NumberTooBig> @lovesosa236 but that means blue team would have to do extra work LUL
[1:20:37] <cjsugar> @greatnumber thx yo
[1:20:38] <yourbuddycarl> Man i wish bullet didnt suffer from the fact that he has to be right on her enemy
[1:20:38] <SpookySpaghooti> @cjsugar Reggie and I think Pedro
[1:20:39] <MTLxSpider> so if you are +4. it means you recover 4 frame faster. but if you are -5. it means your opponent can move 5 faster before you
[1:20:42] <%Zanethepure> It's C
[1:20:43] <%Rawklobstah88> GETTEM REGGIE

[1:21:02] <OkNow_64> A
[1:21:04] <Sorubr0> combos and blockstun in this game are so stiff compared to GG
[1:21:05] <%Zanethepure> 720A, QC to HC is C
[1:21:06] <%Wool> You should have let the Astral hit for LP funsies
[1:21:08] <gatorafan> 720 buttons Kappa
[1:21:09] <lovesosa236> I feel like a p5 fighting game would get 3d models
[1:21:10] <Festtag> If you have 2 heat you can 720C 360D 720D
[1:21:16] <Festtag> it does 7k damage
[1:21:20] <CalderGaming> 720A 720D 1080D if you have lvl 2 charge
[1:21:22] <MTLxSpider> WHEN IS FOOZIES

[1:22:14] <Brimner> yeah bb is dope
[1:22:24] <wirblewomble> I thought we didn't press the D button...
[1:22:26] <Brimner> just never shake hands with arakune or valk players
[1:22:32] <lovesosa236> switch to her Ghost in the shell color pallet :o
[1:22:34] <Brimner> kappa
[1:22:35] <Festtag> Arakune players deserve mad respect
[1:22:38] <Festtag> That's a hard character
[1:22:47] <MTLxSpider> @wirblewomble only for izayoi. pressing D will change her stance (notice her sword will change color)
[1:22:50] <Brimner> you arent wrong but
[1:22:55] <Brimner> at the same time its arakune ya know\
[1:22:56] <%Greatnumber> Arakune hurts my head though
[1:22:58] <pandangerous> they can get it from someone who ain't me
[1:23:18] <anovertmoose> @Festtag everyone says that until they play an actual arakune player
[1:23:21] <anovertmoose> then they curse their names
[1:23:21] <Brimner> like actually arakune players deserve the execution respect but like gez
[1:23:25] <MTLxSpider> RIP
[1:23:26] <Festtag> But Arakune is the most unique character in BB
[1:23:29] <+mtlwolf_> LOl
[1:23:30] <Festtag> He's mad cool
[1:23:31] <SpookySpaghooti> First Astral of the night

[1:23:47] <MainMan_Jonadiah> I just got here, did I miss the traditional "guest styles on Reggie and/or Woolie SUPER hard?"
[1:23:48] <Joysta> animeeeeeeeeeeeeee
[1:23:48] <$FuqBoiSlim> ASTRAL F I N I S H
[1:23:48] <+Cebardo> We got our 1st astral of the night
[1:23:51] <lovesosa236> every bb character is the most unique character tho
[1:23:58] <MTLxSpider> and your portrait will flash white
[1:24:00] <haisho> No guest hasn't styled on anyone yet
[1:24:01] <%thatonestraightman> win by weebshit
[1:24:02] <MTLxSpider> meaning you can astral
[1:24:06] <anovertmoose> if he hasn't already I want Woolie to see what Arakune can actually do so he can be disgusted
[1:24:08] <waifoong98> @SpookySpaghooti hardest part is remembering which special does what range tbh
[1:24:15] <Axle13j> AAAANNIIIMEEE

[1:24:35] <%Zanethepure> @WoolieVersus 2C is your best friend in this matchup
[1:24:36] <%Greatnumber> @MainMan_Jonadiah You missed a TedTalk from the third guest Pedro. We are now in study hall session with Woolie and Reggie learning some characters.
[1:24:38] <waifoong98> Oh shit, stance switcher pain LUL
[1:24:38] <sortedspiral> @woolieversus So each of your absolute favourites to play for this are? I know you said for some of you, but would you please repeat for each of you who you like best? And are they the same as the characters that you just like best as characters? Thanks again : )
[1:24:47] <Festtag> He still has 3 360's
[1:25:02] <NarcissistCactus> nice essay
[1:25:02] <haisho> time for Woolie to confuse himself with stance switches
[1:25:04] <nutimik> Kagura is awesome, very fun to play
[1:25:10] <MainMan_Jonadiah> @Greatnumber I caught a bit of the powerpoint, it was magical. So they're just messing around right now?

[1:26:03] <lovesosa236> I wish his sword had a tip
[1:26:14] <$cherubsanonymous> Kagura is great
[1:26:17] <waifoong98> @BigPapatheFirst LUL
[1:26:17] <nutimik> "we want get into his stances" we'll ignore the entire character? :P
[1:26:17] <Axle13j> tfw no motorhead BibleThump
[1:26:27] <Festtag> Kagura's stances are his entire character
[1:26:32] <kasparkurogane> you can go into 5D stance, 2D stance, and 6D stance
[1:26:32] <%Greatnumber> @MainMan_Jonadiah Yeah, glorified button checks and sort of practice mode right until they get the basic gist it seems.
[1:26:33] <MTLxSpider> LOL
[1:26:34] <kasparkurogane> also in the air
[1:26:35] <waifoong98> Woolie, your main thing is using D
[1:26:36] <Festtag> Him having guile moves does not matter
[1:26:38] <+mtlwolf_> POGGERS
[1:26:38] <MTLxSpider> YO
[1:26:39] <nutimik> "we won't" I meant
[1:26:40] <MTLxSpider> THAT WAS A BNB

[1:27:14] <+mtlwolf_> carciOWO carciOWO carciOWO carciOWO carciOWO
[1:27:18] <kasparkurogane> [4] 236D or C i'm pretty sure is his super
[1:27:27] <%Zanethepure> @WoolieVersus supers are D 28D or charge away HCF C
[1:27:29] <stormhawk9891> stance28D for Kagura super
[1:27:29] <SunsetJack> 236A or 236B has armor?
[1:27:35] <MTLxSpider> @Yosogoto https://twitter.com/pochp_/status/1090436881534369793

[1:27:41] <theordinarypenguin> kagura super is like [4] 41236C
[1:27:44] <Yosogoto> Thanks
[1:27:52] <Zerotoad5> @WoolieVersus someone should have the move list open on their phone
[1:28:20] <stormhawk9891> Weird but easy inputs for Kagura supers
[1:28:33] <%Zanethepure> Kagura 2C goes through Tager's green hand btw
[1:28:34] <+FloorBurger> That projectile is fucked up.
[1:28:36] <waifoong98> Almost perfect Kappa
[1:28:43] <+AirMaster> no woolie
[1:28:44] <MTLxSpider> woolie is gonna be a sasuke
[1:28:45] <+AirMaster> don't do it
[1:28:50] <SpookySpaghooti> I hope Woolie gets Kagura's "throw up a bitch and catch her" win pose
[1:28:50] <%Greatnumber> Woolie is finding his rhythm
[1:28:51] <+mtlwolf_> yes woolie
[1:28:51] <nutimik> Kagura and Azrael are the most fun to play imo
[1:28:53] <+mtlwolf_> DO IT
[1:28:56] <el_patronn64> Kagura is sick
[1:29:02] <MTLxSpider> yes woolie come play kagura for airmaster
[1:29:02] <+mtlwolf_> BECOME THE KAGURA MTL NEEDS

[1:29:09] <+mtlwolf_> looks at airmaster
[1:29:10] <didgereedoodah> Kagura's fine as long as you aren't fighting Nu
[1:29:11] <SpookySpaghooti> WOW HE GOT IT
[1:29:13] <+mtlwolf_> sodaMONK
[1:29:13] <+AirMaster> wow. wes setting up woolie up for a life of suffering
[1:29:13] <lovesosa236> the only problem I have about this game is no subtitles during fights
[1:29:14] <MTLxSpider> replace airmaster for us
[1:29:17] <waifoong98> he got a harem you meant LUL
[1:29:20] <Festtag> Kagura has 3 stances with 3 moves each and he can cancel and stance move into a stance you havent used yet
[1:29:27] <+mtlwolf_> kagura is a nice character
[1:29:33] <kasparkurogane> kagura's DP has a second attack too... [8] 2C after normal DP
[1:29:36] <+mtlwolf_> you just dont give him enough credits
[1:29:38] <Dat_Guy_SLaTeR> dude its anime gief
[1:29:41] <midnaz2> A Blazblue Central fiction the game that made me loss faith in Arc system works.
[1:29:46] <%Solidnick18> and that has an air version

[1:30:21] <MTLxSpider> flashkick
[1:30:22] <MTLxSpider> hold dat
[1:30:27] <+mtlwolf_> lmao
[1:30:31] <theziggystar> lytCANDY lytCANDY lytCANDY
[1:30:36] <+AirMaster> to do anything with kagura, you have to do 82C in combos and fuck that shit
[1:30:44] <+GunterDriger6> That was almost sick!
[1:30:47] <%Greatnumber> Look at that health bar, see the progression!
[1:30:51] <+FloorBurger> Woolie is felling himself.
[1:30:57] <deafmelone> after activating overdrive, press all buttons again for free mini super
[1:31:00] <MTLxSpider> grappler damage
[1:31:00] <pandangerous> hit him with the surfboard SwiftRage
[1:31:02] <MTLxSpider> 236D
[1:31:07] <MainMan_Jonadiah> COUNTER COUNTER COUN- COUNTER
[1:31:13] <SpookySpaghooti> I wanna see Kagura's other DD, the giant slam one
[1:31:15] <+ChansonNoire> D
[1:31:19] <BwdYeti> "B?" "D"
[1:31:23] <didgereedoodah> @WoolieVersus you can follow up the flashkick with 82 charge
[1:31:26] <$Magir0ck> cheer10
[1:31:30] <Brimner> tells my tager man to mash out some 720c
[1:31:30] <%Zanethepure> @WoolieVersus Important detail for Kagura is that when you do a stance holding the next button will make the stance move come out immediately, so D into hold A/B/C is optimal. Big Important
[1:31:33] <+mtlwolf_> OOF
[1:31:38] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Let's go Reggie!
[1:31:46] <+VektorTroika> Team TAGER
[1:32:01] <%Greatnumber> We are getting to the magic part of the learning process where it's starting to be a back and forth.

[1:32:13] <MTLxSpider> is such a godlike move

[1:32:32] <MTLxSpider> da god
[1:32:34] <Festtag> Have their found Exceed Accel yet?
[1:32:38] <%Zanethepure> Important detail for Kagura is that when you do a stance holding the next button will make the stance move come out immediately, so D into hold A/B/C is optimal. Big Important
[1:32:46] <deafmelone> when in overdrive, press all buttons again for free mini super
[1:32:48] <MTLxSpider> they have overdrived but didnt EA yet
[1:32:52] <Festtag> Just hold
[1:33:04] <Festtag> OD and you go into EA immediately
[1:33:05] <Sorubr0> whens Blitzkampf
[1:33:20] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Man, Blazblue is so cool, I wish I was even a little good at it
[1:33:20] <MTLxSpider> üëÄ
[1:33:29] <SpookySpaghooti> Woolie's getting a lot of mileage out of that DP
[1:33:39] <MTLxSpider> just learning combos is good enough to get you started
[1:33:55] <%Fighter_Zeta> BlazBlue is a game I very much consider worth learning, even for just casual play
[1:34:00] <%Greatnumber> Reggie at match point!
[1:34:02] <ASWATKAT> No stick woolz
[1:34:05] <thwak> guilty gear is still mash to tech
[1:34:07] <Festtag> Problem is BB has awful tutorials, bad mission mode and people don't like writing ressources for it
[1:34:20] <FatDragonQuest> I wish I could get deep into guilty gear but it's so complex haha
[1:34:21] <+mtlwolf_> actually
[1:34:27] <+mtlwolf_> people write a lot about it
[1:34:29] <MTLxSpider> well
[1:34:32] <revzero25> i thought the tutorial in central fiction was pretty good
[1:34:35] <didgereedoodah> bruh what
[1:34:36] <MTLxSpider> the game is old enough and has enough ressources
[1:34:37] <NarcissistCactus> blazblue tutorial is good
[1:34:38] <MTLxSpider> with discord
[1:34:40] <+ChansonNoire> reggie yest tellement bon

[1:37:36] <kasparkurogane> THE MADMAN
[1:37:38] <waifoong98> Carl can be pretty fun... but learning him is a choreeeee
[1:37:42] <%Greatnumber> BIG PUNCH
[1:37:48] <LandOfTheWay> THE BATTLE OF THE UNGA LORDS
[1:37:50] <+mashinchaserr> is this the part where we start kickig?
[1:37:59] <MTLxSpider> unga unga 5B
[1:37:59] <Festtag> That azrael super becomes unblockable on the heights he puts terror on you

[1:38:07] <NarcissistCactus> I was bored one day and decided to learn carl
[1:38:07] <%Zanethepure> 2C, 6B, 5B, 5A isn't bad either
[1:38:10] <+Tenebrae94> jiyuAzrael
[1:38:11] <+mtlwolf_> hits behind LUL
[1:38:19] <waifoong98> @SpookySpaghooti heavier pressure I guess LUL
[1:38:19] <$FuqBoiSlim> the unga is here but wheres the bunga
[1:38:21] <JJenesis> also has a DP
[1:38:24] <ivansonic08> Hey i'm not familiar with fighting games what do the numbers behind the button imput mean?
[1:38:27] <$konekoryugamine> YO
[1:38:29] <%Solidnick18> charge dat
[1:38:29] <ivansonic08> Is that a direction
[1:38:34] <krin_x> all unga
[1:38:45] <+FloorBurger> Is Azrael just Slayer without the class?
[1:38:46] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Man, I"m just remembering Azrael's move-names, and getting hype. Let's see that "Growler Field."
[1:38:48] <revzero25> yes
[1:38:50] <SpookySpaghooti> @ivansonic08 they refer to the position of the control stick, theyre numbered from 1-8 I think (2 being straight down, etc)
[1:38:55] <solidgobi> @ivansonic08 numberpad notation.
[1:38:57] <deafmelone> azzy has a divekick
[1:38:58] <+StellarSpiral> @ivansonic08 The direction, like on a keyboard's numpad
[1:39:03] <ivansonic08> So i guessed correctly
[1:39:06] <ivansonic08> Thanks
[1:39:07] <SpookySpaghooti> @MainMan_Jonadiah PATRIOT APOCALYPSE
[1:39:10] <MTLxSpider> overdrive
[1:39:12] <NumberTooBig> @ivansonic08 the numbers correspond to the computer's keypad, 5 being the center or the joystick at rest
[1:39:21] <%Zanethepure> Overdrive spends your burst
[1:39:23] <MainMan_Jonadiah> @SpookySpaghooti I DIDN'T KNOW THAT ONE!!!
[1:39:31] <MTLxSpider> it stop times
[1:39:33] <MainMan_Jonadiah> @SpookySpaghooti Azrael's the best!
[1:39:33] <Festtag> Overdrive is also tied to burst
[1:39:34] <SpookySpaghooti> @MainMan_Jonadiah thats his Astral and easily the best one
[1:40:00] <SunsetJack> Overdrive can only be done while attacking, blocking or during neutral. If are being hit and you press all button, you get burst.
[1:40:01] <Festtag> If you press OD again while in OD you get a reversal super
[1:40:03] <ivansonic08> Also is that avdo'l's voice actor?
[1:40:11] <+Aerodat> yes
[1:40:23] <SunsetJack> You can also hold OD again.
[1:40:25] <+spicystomp> you can hold it after going into OD again iirc
[1:40:25] <SpookySpaghooti> can we talk about Azrael's theme and how sick the breakdown is
[1:40:26] <%Greatnumber> I hate Azrael's astral because I got hit by it too much... woolieTRASH
[1:40:29] <+Aerodat> kenta miyake voices avdol and susanoo
[1:40:43] <MTLxSpider> hitboxes
[1:40:50] <%Zanethepure> Overdrive on block and on hit are cut in half time compared to just activating it
[1:40:54] <waifoong98> @SpookySpaghooti I hate it, the training stage/ combo mode makes me hate it
[1:40:59] <deafmelone> overdrive also stops time and lasts longer if you have less health i think
[1:41:00] <+FadingEmber> Can we ask the real question? When are fighting games going normalize the smash bros name tags?
[1:41:13] <%Greatnumber> @FadingEmber never
[1:41:13] <nutimik> I need woolie to hit a marked kick
[1:41:15] <+spicystomp> they don't need to
[1:41:19] <+StellarSpiral> No pls lol
[1:41:26] <l4dy_luck> That would clutter the screen.

[1:53:58] <nutimik> ah dbz
[1:54:00] <wirblewomble> new series, getting into dwarf fortress
[1:54:01] <+mtlwolf_> POGGERS reggie
[1:54:02] <revzero25> Practice the fundementals like, footsies, shimmies, anti-airs, and hit confirming thats what i do though i am an intermediate player when it comes to fighters
[1:54:02] <Mattmandx1> @MainMan_Jonadiah January 31
[1:54:06] <+jetjagger222> No world heroes though :(
[1:54:08] <MTLxSpider> @WoolieVersus when is foozies
[1:54:08] <ConeCorvid> lol
[1:54:10] <haisho> so when's Antimony of Common Flowers for extra jank?
[1:54:19] <SomersaultJustice> @WoolieVersus Any plans to play Soulcalibur VI?
[1:54:33] <pandangerous> touhou fighters past soku DansGame
[1:54:48] <+GreatestGuess> Soku is still very active online
[1:54:50] <tacostarvedbeast> @WoolieVersus any chance for gleam of force again? that game was dope
[1:54:58] <+ramielthe5th> apatHoldon
[1:54:58] <Triplicat> did someone ask if the foosies concept came up before or after hifight released his thing? ü§ê
[1:54:59] <waifoong98> Throw bounce combo LUL
[1:55:01] <haisho> that's why I said EXTRA jank
[1:55:03] <+WhyIDie> knowing what the opponent would do when you do something, and then learning how to react to that reaction helps greatly
[1:55:03] <+supahrob64> But watching competetive footage doesnt work in this game when you play Bullet feelsbadman
[1:55:10] <pandangerous> fair enough LUL
[1:55:12] <%Menitta> Oh boy
[1:55:13] <Axle13j> wish I saw more Makoto in top 8 BibleThump
[1:55:17] <%Zanethepure> @WoolieVersus lemme know if you need any info for Kagura, at any level of understanding.
[1:55:35] <waifoong98> @Axle13j it is always Jin, even Tag LUL
[1:55:44] <Axle13j> lol
[1:55:57] <kasparkurogane> reggie two inputs at a time :P
[1:56:05] <kasparkurogane> patience is a virtue
[1:56:08] <+Cebardo> Tips for dealing with tilt?
[1:56:18] <+Cebardo> Your own specifically?
[1:56:19] <waifoong98> RC combo time LUL
[1:56:23] <+DeaconBluesClues> @WoolieVersus here's a weird one: outside of street fighter, who plays like claw (in fighting games in general)? he seems like an under exploited character archetype.
[1:56:24] <LandOfTheWay> @waifoong98 the ice car is inescapable, no matter the game
[1:56:29] <TigerClaws12> uh oh RC combos LUL
[1:56:32] <waifoong98> @LandOfTheWay damn right
[1:56:33] <Greenbor> @WoolieVersus Are you going to try to learn Gundam Versus on a future episode?
[1:56:35] <Festtag> While you're in the heat you shouldn't really think, you should see a situation and instinctively know what to do. If you don't you should lab or read up more in between
[1:56:36] <+FadingEmber> @WoolieVersus Do you think you ever do a series where you design a fighting game characters (maybe with Plauge)? Character design, moveset, etc.
[1:56:41] <TigerClaws12> not watching combo demos?
[1:56:45] <reokie_t7> Jin and feng give you decision fatiguedue to having so many options for a situation
[1:56:48] <Axle13j> ICE CAR
[1:56:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus what type of fighting games do you dislike the most? and what style of playing do you dislike the most
[1:56:54] <%Greatnumber> @WoolieVersus So any pointers for idiots like me. Who will either mash at all times, or the moment it all goes to shit and we are pressured we mash harder ever?
[1:56:58] <+ChansonNoire> reggie y'est trop bon pour regarder des d√©mos
[1:57:01] <+WhyIDie> learn to love figuring out how to get past things in FGs, think of them as puzzles to figure out, if you tilt, you don't love that, you just want to win
[1:57:12] <Smileyhat> @WoolieVersus Makes sense, thanks for the answer.
[1:57:15] <+mtlwolf_> say to reggie ABC = Focus Attack cancel (but no dash or backdash) @WoolieVersus
[1:57:18] <MTLxSpider> @WoolieVersus when is foozies
[1:57:19] <%Zanethepure> This combo works fine in the corner fyi
[1:57:24] <+attackofthesage> Paige is donating LUL

[1:57:43] <%Menitta> @WoolieVersus If this has been answered already, sorry but what's a good way to incorporate combos or more advanced setups? That's been my biggest issue as of late I feel.
[1:57:44] <+attackofthesage> Idk but she said she's using pats card
[1:57:45] <SchroedingersFerret> Paige committing fraud
[1:57:47] <Triplicat> knowledge is a great helper to not mashing @Greatnumber
[1:57:47] <+DeaconBluesClues> On tilt: take 20 minutes away from the game if you can. Also, don't talk to a man for about 20 minutes after he loses in a tournament.
[1:57:51] <+mtlwolf_> no need for shorcut
[1:57:52] <Triplicat> errrrr
[1:57:54] <nemr118> @woolieversus are there any xbox fighting sticks you would reccomend?
[1:58:01] <majinpickles> sup @woolieversus
[1:58:03] <Triplicat> from someone who mashes a lot

[1:58:52] <person181> don't spoil it
[1:58:56] <dan_g_v> I hope Paige leaves a good message

[1:59:09] <DarkKnightGrave> LUL
[1:59:09] <Mattmandx1> Lag and input delay makes me tilt more than anything
[1:59:12] <+attackofthesage> we're gonna be super Jebaited
[1:59:14] <Malik1002> do you guys practice combos on both sides
[1:59:19] <+WhyIDie> when you're losing in a match, first thing you should be asking yourself is "what things am I losing to?", identify those things, then ask "what can I do to overcome it?"
[1:59:26] <NumberTooBig> @Malik1002 always do that
[1:59:41] <+ramielthe5th> apatHoldon
[1:59:53] <TigerClaws12> keep going reggie
[1:59:59] <Smileyhat> I think I've found a lot of my tilt happens when I don't understand why something isn't working.
[2:00:07] <+mtlwolf_> can you put the volume a bit more down ? @WoolieVersus

[2:01:01] <Serge_12> Woolie Thank You For Doing This! cashHype cashHype cashHype cashHype cashLbj cashLbj cashLbj
[2:01:02] <%Greatnumber> @Triplicat So sort of learn a rhythm and try to keep to it? Would you have any specific characters in a game or a game all together that might help really get it through my head?
[2:01:03] <+attackofthesage> if it were anybody but woolie that wouldn't have been genuine lol
[2:01:04] <Laironx3> Pat is just afraid of fighting games
[2:01:05] <ConeCorvid> in it for the long haul

[2:01:17] <AmericanaRed> Red Bull payback
[2:01:18] <kasparkurogane> pat was decent at fighting games wasn't he?
[2:01:19] <+WhyIDie> @Smileyhat something might seem like it should work, but if it's not consistent, try other things, a good FG allows for multiple things to be an answer to an opponent's option
[2:01:19] <dan_g_v> Pat is Elmo's dad
[2:01:25] <Axle13j> YEYEYEYEYE
[2:01:25] <+neo_cosmos> Woolie Versus Powerpoint
[2:01:27] <joylent_blue> @WoolieVersus people keep butchering pats joke, it was really not as mean as they're making it sound
[2:01:30] <+VektorTroika> her stance is traaaaash
[2:01:31] <Game_King7797> is woolie SEXIST
[2:01:31] <landsharkRAWR> this game is supremely horney
[2:01:33] <+FloorBurger> For Bison, it was Tuesday. For Woolie it was scrublords.
[2:01:34] <haisho> She's a squirrel. It makes it sense
[2:01:34] <%Solidnick18> she's got cross ups
[2:01:35] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> this lady needs to calm down
[2:01:39] <CalderGaming> bullet is Not a Cat. she's Not.
[2:01:40] <Triplicat> I don't think it's a game specific thing, my man. Most (all?) fighting games have input buffers
[2:01:41] <+supahrob64> Squirrel girl
[2:01:42] <Tucker0603> BULLET HAS A PILE BUNKER GAUNTLET SHES TRUE WAIFU
[2:01:42] <+Ryosuke91> damn her boobs r giggly
[2:01:49] <Triplicat> but it is definitely a practice thing
[2:01:50] <nobody12349> @joylent_blue Thst's the joke
[2:01:52] <+ilpeggiore_> i mean 500+ viewers on a blazblue game is not bad...
[2:01:54] <%Menitta> Doom Bitch
[2:01:58] <%UrsulaCat> green all day every day
[2:01:58] <waifoong98> she is dmg-ed in the head LUL
[2:01:59] <dukenux> Makoto Kreygasm
[2:02:03] <Ariksgabs> That's a Woolie character if I ever see one
[2:02:05] <alrobot2014> poor doom bitch :(
[2:02:05] <joylent_blue> nobody12349 woolie doesn't know that
[2:02:06] <dan_g_v> a little jello
[2:02:07] <DarkKnightGrave> UNDERBOOB
[2:02:09] <Mattmandx1> Bullet just has a long belt. Why do people think she's a cat?
[2:02:11] <milhousego> did Paiges fraud go through?
[2:02:13] <NumberTooBig> Yoko Littner, the Doom Bringer
[2:02:13] <mistersups> Tan skin, Green Clothes, Light short hair?
[2:02:15] <Smileyhat> @WhyIDie Yeah, I gotcha. I think it'd also help to watch replays and try to find out where it went wrong there.
[2:02:16] <%UrsulaCat> *sees green* nice woolie reference
[2:02:19] <nobody12349> What's with Makotos being awesome punch girls?
[2:02:21] <dukenux> Better Squirrelgirk
[2:02:21] <zucchinibread> SourPls
[2:02:22] <Zael913> Why must you beat up my bot Azrael?
[2:02:28] <Zael913> *boi
[2:02:28] <Triplicat> just knowing that mashing to do combos often makes it worse is the first step
[2:02:34] <LunarDiscorded> Makoto is best girl
[2:02:45] <Game_King7797> active reload that squirrel
[2:02:48] <DarkKnightGrave> Still waiting Paige.
[2:02:58] <Triplicat> I'm already assuming you're talking like super hard mashing and not like double/triple tapping, which is different for sure
[2:03:02] <didgereedoodah> you can only special cancel level 2 and level 1
[2:03:05] <MyNameIsRasus> Still waiting for the NTR
[2:03:10] <sortedspiral> @woolieversus Reggie and Pedro‚Äôs #1 faves for this?
[2:03:13] <Hoarseplay> You can only special cancel Level 2 Drives.
[2:03:19] <kasparkurogane> i think you should play without button shortcuts
[2:03:26] <kasparkurogane> might be easier understanding the button combos
[2:03:33] <Greenbor> @WoolieVersus Are you going to try to learn Gundam Versus on a future episode?
[2:03:39] <kasparkurogane> like barrier vs throw and rapid / OD
[2:03:45] <+Ryosuke91> ADA WAIT
[2:03:50] <+ThePaleSage> Arakune deserves more love
[2:03:54] <flex_tape39> where the fuck is jaaaaa?
[2:04:00] <+ChansonNoire> coliss
[2:04:02] <%Greatnumber> @Triplicat whenever my head is cool its double and triple tapping at most, whenever it gets near the end of the match and my nerves get the best of me it can get a bit much
[2:04:05] <dukenux> Where is JA?
[2:04:05] <+ChansonNoire> @AirMaster aweille
[2:04:09] <+AirMaster> @WoolieVersus I can do it
[2:04:11] <Mattmandx1> Terumi is my favorite despite being kinda basic and limited. His style makes up for his shittiness
[2:04:14] <MTLxSpider> @AirMaster yo on joue chez lui live
[2:04:17] <MTLxSpider> Kappa
[2:04:21] <Triplicat> everyone else seems to have gotten it out of their system already but allow me to also throw in my "wow woolie streaming blazblue seriously that's FUCKING WEIRD" comment
[2:04:22] <MyNameIsRasus> where IS Ja?
[2:04:28] <Smileyhat> I just want to see "Woolie Versus Gundam Versus" as a title.
[2:04:31] <Greenbor> @WoolieVersus no im talking about PS4 version
[2:04:38] <Greenbor> the new one
[2:04:45] <ZippyPsycho> No Dissida either?
[2:04:47] <%Menitta> @WoolieVersus The new one doesnt have that issue
[2:04:49] <graemecrackers1> !!!

[2:04:56] <Malik1002> Nah son there is a new gundam versus for America for ps4 you can play
[2:04:59] <flex_tape39> we need a fyre fest anime to happen. it would hands down be the number 1 hit on crunchyroll
[2:05:04] <+AirMaster> @WoolieVersus I can do it
[2:05:13] <kasparkurogane> BLADE STRANGERS
[2:05:15] <+king_of_beggars> When Virtual On?
[2:05:16] <+mtlwolf_> rumble fish 2 !
[2:05:18] <dukenux> Thatd be just a Battle Royale anime
[2:05:20] <+jetjagger222> change air blade

[2:06:03] <SunsetJack> You are pressing 3C I think
[2:06:12] <dukenux> my screen is to tiny to see... whos next to Reggie? is yhat Soushin?
[2:06:34] <NarcissistCactus> that's woolie
[2:06:39] <waifoong98> 3C is a different button altogether @WoolieVersus
[2:06:44] <Liransherman> u can always look at the example for timings
[2:06:49] <dukenux> Kappa
[2:07:06] <+ChansonNoire> @WoolieVersus you gotta do 2C for the combo, 3C is a slow sweep
[2:07:17] <+jorgamund> new Billy?
[2:07:18] <dukenux> Ohai Pedro
[2:07:19] <SunsetJack> Why not show off some supers from certain characters for fun?
[2:07:24] <%Greatnumber> ALL THE WARRIORS
[2:07:28] <+supahrob64> Patrick: WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE
[2:07:31] <nutimik> Oh hey it's Liam in the middle OpieOP

[2:07:35] <alrobot2014> woolie has too many friends Kappa
[2:07:41] <JJMR322> but who are these people though...
[2:07:41] <+DeadPixels45> @WoolieVersus Have you been labbing 3s? We need to do that runback from last ComboCon.
[2:07:47] <Joysta> woolies best friends play
[2:07:53] <%Asagi66> hi peach
[2:07:54] <nobara> We're not used to people knowing what they're talking about
[2:07:59] <%Greatnumber> @PeachSaliva You finally got BIG MOD powers!
[2:08:02] <@PeachSaliva> @asagi66 howdy
[2:08:02] <Festtag> @WoolieVersus Is there a way to improve reaction time? I've been playing fighting games for a while but I don't seem to get better at recognizing overheads or throws even tho I know what they look like. Most of the time I just try to predict them.
[2:08:03] <dukenux> Woolie put too many points in CHA
[2:08:10] <mr_miyagichu> Is this on ps4?
[2:08:14] <@PeachSaliva> @greatnumber I won‚Äôt let him down!
[2:08:15] <person181> and paige has true power once more
[2:08:15] <gunstar73> Woolie don‚Äôt you play short stack big sword girl you coward
[2:08:18] <Greenbor> @WoolieVersus The PS4 version of Gundam Versus got a English release so you can buy it on the PSN store right now
[2:08:25] <MTLxSpider> its on ps4, ps3, pc, switch @mr_miyagichu
[2:08:26] <waifoong98> @gunstar73 LUL
[2:08:28] <ZippyPsycho> Woolie should do Makoto‚Äôs taunt for a reference to a certain game
[2:08:31] <MTLxSpider> well coming to switch?
[2:08:31] <mr_miyagichu> I mean is woolie playing ps4 version
[2:08:32] <@PeachSaliva> Did my donation go through?
[2:08:34] <JJMR322> now paige is also big and strong in here
[2:08:34] <+WhyIDie> woolie is the special sauce you add on top of any group of friends to make them best friends
[2:08:36] <MTLxSpider> ps4
[2:08:42] <@PeachSaliva> Just wanted to double check. First one I‚Äôve ever made.
[2:08:51] <JJMR322> yes it did paige
[2:08:53] <Liransherman> well almost all the challenges just teach u what works on the characters technical wise and usually wont show optimal combos for example
[2:08:54] <@PeachSaliva> Yay!
[2:08:55] <Axle13j> @whyidie
[2:08:56] <Liransherman> even on later challenges
[2:09:03] <gunstar73> Now we wait
[2:09:03] <Axle13j> that beautiful
[2:09:04] <@PeachSaliva> That makes me happy :3
[2:09:05] <+neo_cosmos> uhnHeart uhnHeart
[2:09:10] <MTLxSpider> @WoolieVersus when is foozies.
[2:09:13] <waifoong98> Don't worry, I waste 3-4 hours on some of these
[2:10:01] <Smileyhat> I have that Millia app.
[2:10:08] <Triplicat> MILLIA BLOCKER
[2:10:09] <sparrrow_> also set up a training dummy that randomly does lows and overheads and just practice blocking
[2:10:30] <mr_miyagichu> There‚Äôs an app to block millia mixups? LUL
[2:10:30] <+GreatestGuess> Didn‚Äôt Mike Z make the Millia blocker?
[2:10:37] <mr_miyagichu> That‚Äôs amazing
[2:10:37] <waifoong98> Millia LUL
[2:10:39] <dukenux> question, is that app good for someone who suffered from epileptoc attack? LUL
[2:10:47] <Triplicat> hell no he didn't
[2:11:07] <Triplicat> http://www.teyah.net/milliablocker.html
[2:11:22] <%Zanethepure> Overheads are typically slower than lows
[2:11:22] <pandangerous> put on conciliation SwiftRage
[2:11:25] <%Greatnumber> Thanks
[2:11:32] <ConeCorvid> if there is an audio cue, you might be better off listening for that. audio reaction time is significantly lower than visual reaction time
[2:11:39] <waifoong98> LUL
[2:11:40] <flex_tape39> where is Ja is definitely a bigger question than where's waldo.
[2:11:46] <ShreddingPixels> damn
[2:11:47] <%QueequegTheater> I just want everyone to remember Woolie sent me alone into the Darkest Dungeon
[2:11:51] <KeiPrime> taokaka
[2:11:52] <MTLxSpider> what about
[2:11:53] <MTLxSpider> FOOZIEs
[2:11:54] <JJMR322> Ja Rule will never be found
[2:11:58] <Liransherman> @WoolieVersus the good thing about BB is the variety when it comes to picking a character aswell
[2:11:59] <nobara> If Woolie likes Rachel I'll Freak
[2:12:01] <%Zanethepure> @WoolieVersus want a BnB for Kag?
[2:12:06] <gunstar73> Big sword girl
[2:12:07] <dukenux> Waldo could be on Fyre... unlike Ja
[2:12:14] <+JacktheMan18> Did Woolie try out Bullet yet?
[2:12:15] <Zinax7> @WoolieVersus With the upcoming release of granblue fantasy versus people are hyped because of arcsys making it but then begin to complain when they learn the gameplay is gonna be simple ala street fighter 2. What's so bad about it?
[2:12:17] <@PeachSaliva> Punch Daddy!!
[2:12:24] <MTLxSpider> LOL
[2:12:26] <MTLxSpider> ok
[2:12:28] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> LUL
[2:12:32] <+WhyIDie> we all know woolie is a filthy arakune player, your inner blanka is screaming for it
[2:12:35] <bsmusic> PUNCH DADDY HYPE
[2:12:35] <+ChansonNoire> tabarnak alex
[2:12:36] <%Greatnumber> Called out!
[2:12:38] <haisho> oh no we have kusoge
[2:12:44] <ShinobiPhoenix> @woolieversus what I want to know is "Whens Woolie VS Smash Bros Ultimate?" We never did get that Fisticuffs. also, PIRAHNA PLANT IS OUT! And possibly too good,
[2:12:48] <%QueequegTheater> How about you abuse my loyalty in DD again Woolie
[2:12:49] <+DaRoosta89> DAAAAMN FTG Alex
[2:12:50] <Liransherman> @WoolieVersus u can try Bullet if u want Punchy Girl
[2:12:52] <Hoarseplay> Foosies isn't kusoge, it's just basic.
[2:13:02] <waifoong98> @Liransherman he tried already
[2:13:05] <gunstar73> Give noel her hat back fedThump
[2:13:06] <BigPapatheFirst> SUSANOO IS YOUR DESTINY WOOLIE
[2:13:11] <%Greatnumber> Reggie is right here
[2:13:14] <Liransherman> okeh
[2:13:16] <nobody12349> "Smash friends"
[2:13:17] <CalderGaming> @haisho the general format for this show is 2 good games, one kusoge
[2:13:18] <waifoong98> @gunstar73 spend 30000$ fun bucks LUL
[2:13:18] <JJMR322> get those smash people in there
[2:13:21] <el_patronn64> lol
[2:13:25] <Game_King7797> oh no we can see his inputs
[2:13:26] <+pr0at> they just need to shower before they come over atpRtsd4
[2:13:26] <flex_tape39> Ja Rule could very well be the hero we never expected because he'll never be found. he's chilling with Tupac.
[2:13:27] <+WhyIDie> sakurai shows up on next stream LUL
[2:13:28] <dukenux> smash friends Kappa
[2:13:30] <%Menitta> Plant is kinda basic imo
[2:13:32] <Silversunburst> Show him naoto aka the wrist destroyer.
[2:13:33] <%Fighter_Zeta> @Zinax7 It's a bit more than that, they're spooked of autos and other junk because of BBTAG
[2:13:35] <nobody12349> Woolie, the term is friends with benefits
[2:13:44] <jsavarin> what kind of style do you usually play in fighting games? do you prefer aggressive or maybe more defensive style?
[2:13:46] <Mattmandx1> @gunstar73 Her old outfit is actually unlockable in gallery mode
[2:13:47] <Liransherman> Air drives are the same as how u start them on the ground and u can also choose how he drops aswell
[2:13:56] <DaisyFannn> Reggie is a OG smash back in 06 times.
[2:13:59] <gunstar73> They knew
[2:14:07] <%Zanethepure> @WoolieVersus Air drive is usually a bad idea, it's better to cancel air drive with 4D and use it as a delay in midair
[2:14:08] <ShinobiPhoenix> basic is strong though, nothing wrong with basic
[2:14:14] <ManOfReason> @WoolieVersus How do you balance fighting games with the rest of your life? (work, school, relationships etc.)
[2:14:18] <gunstar73> Reggie who do you main in ultimate
[2:14:25] <kasparkurogane> 5BB, 3C, 2D, 5C
[2:14:25] <Zinax7> @Fighter_Zeta did arcsys mention bout BBTAG that it's gonna have something that will keep the veterans interested before the game came out?
[2:14:27] <%QueequegTheater> Play an antiquarian
[2:14:29] <%psycosis> I subbed so I didn't get ads and I still get ads, thanks Twitch
[2:14:31] <gunstar73> If it‚Äôs olimar your dead to me fedHYPER
[2:14:33] <%QueequegTheater> Because that went so well
[2:14:35] <flex_tape39> ja rule's final smash will be he'll never be found.
[2:15:02] <Liransherman> probably another stance
[2:15:06] <Liransherman> to cancel it out
[2:15:06] <kasparkurogane> after command grab you wanna do 6D, 5C
[2:15:08] <%Greatnumber> His final smash is he time scams from the moment he uses it.
[2:15:14] <flex_tape39> oh wait he can't be found in the game
[2:15:16] <ShinobiPhoenix> why does Susanoo look like an Evangelion?
[2:15:19] <%QueequegTheater> Ja Rule's final smash is getting his ass kicked by 5 Cent and D12
[2:15:29] <Liransherman> WYVERN
[2:15:32] <%Fighter_Zeta> Can't remember, but BBTAG was really over-simplified so the fans have basically gone into irrational scare mode from the slightest hint of simplicity
[2:15:34] <%psycosis> DMX is out of jail f9lks,reset the clock
[2:15:41] <%Zanethepure> @WoolieVersus 2D is you high/low mixups, 6D is your front back mixups, and 5D has properties, like A has armor, B is command grab, and C is a giant AA
[2:15:42] <kasparkurogane> hmmm maybe not
[2:15:48] <kasparkurogane> i thought so though
[2:16:07] <kasparkurogane> you can end ground combos with it too
[2:16:12] <MyNameIsRasus> Holy shit that is Present Mic's seiyuu
[2:16:20] <%Zanethepure> @WoolieVersus Big Important for Kagura is holding a button when going into drive, so go into drive and hold the button for your follow up
[2:16:21] <el_patronn64> Trials VoHiYo
[2:16:41] <%Zanethepure> also 2C 2DB into Flash kick
[2:16:46] <Triplicat> what if GBFVS is like koihime musou
[2:16:54] <MTLxSpider> id play it
[2:16:57] <MTLxSpider> i like koihime
[2:16:58] <Triplicat> sorry I meant enbu
[2:17:01] <Triplicat> I blew myself up there
[2:17:02] <Liransherman> try 2C 5C 6DC 2DB Flash kick
[2:17:03] <+jorgamund> what are the numbers, shorthand for directions?
[2:17:03] <kasparkurogane> i think you gotta throw out sonic boom after throw
[2:17:05] <jsavarin> @WoolieVersus What sort of style do you like in fighting games? like rush downs or punish characters?
[2:17:06] <Triplicat> yeah that was a compliment
[2:17:07] <Liransherman> i think that works ? i might be wrong
[2:17:16] <Zerotoad5> 6c
[2:17:25] <+AirMaster> mid screen grab > AFireball > 6C
[2:17:27] <kasparkurogane> sonic booom
[2:17:30] <%Zanethepure> @WoolieVersus midscreen throw combos are best if you special cancel after throw with a sonic boom
[2:17:31] <Hoarseplay> I
[2:17:37] <SunsetJack> 2C seems to reach it uh
[2:17:57] <Hoarseplay> I'd rather GBVVS plays like Battle Fantasia.
[2:18:14] <SunsetJack> Hold ABCD to see his overdrive if you haven't check it out yet.
[2:18:19] <gunstar73> He lames it out like cross tekken
[2:18:19] <ShinobiPhoenix> I want to learn to play Geese Howard type punish/parry types
[2:18:20] <waifoong98> May be try out Nauto @WoolieVersus
[2:18:22] <chaozagents> @WoolieVersus what was the game that got you into fighting games?
[2:18:23] <kasparkurogane> yo woolie, you should set the opponent's block to blocking after first attack
[2:18:27] <Liransherman> try 2C 5C 6DC 2DB Flash kick
[2:18:32] <%Zanethepure> @WoolieVersus 6B into 2C chains really good
[2:18:37] <BigPapatheFirst> o hey look at that a command list
[2:18:37] <CalderGaming> DRRRRRAGON
[2:18:44] <kasparkurogane> so you can figure out what links and what doesn't, also can be good for figuring out pressure as well
[2:18:44] <SunsetJack> That's his Astral.
[2:18:45] <Triplicat> WYVERN
[2:18:48] <stormhawk9891> No charge for the super
[2:18:48] <SunsetJack> oh ops, nvm
[2:18:51] <JJenesis> its not a charge
[2:18:51] <Liransherman> u dont have to charge the second super just do 28D Really fast in aNY Stance
[2:18:53] <Liransherman> no charge needed
[2:18:57] <Game_King7797> i've never seen that super
[2:18:59] <%Zanethepure> works on ground too
[2:19:13] <Triplicat> wait hold on
[2:19:24] <Triplicat> he picked the terumi palette
[2:19:47] <+king_of_beggars> !uptime
[2:19:50] <kasparkurogane> SET DUMMY BLOCK TO "BLOCK FIRST HIT" so you can figure out combos
[2:19:51] <Triplicat> woolie's colors is just terumi
[2:20:00] <%Zanethepure> @WoolieVersus 5BB is a chain, it's also 5B>6B and that's an important chain to know, especially since it'll also go into 2C
[2:20:05] <mixel_stuff> 6d-c combos into flash kick in corner
[2:20:07] <Triplicat> i have no followup to this
[2:20:13] <ManOfReason> How do you balance fighting games with the rest of your life? (work, school, relationships etc.)
[2:20:18] <ConeCorvid> 09'er detected Kappa
[2:20:19] <SunsetJack> Same but my main was terrible in CT LOL

[2:31:50] <Jibca> in front of 500 viewers
[2:31:50] <%UrsulaCat> solidus! do well!
[2:31:53] <haisho> Blazblue has an awfully large amount of cinematic intros
[2:31:55] <Jibca> show people how NOT to play naoto
[2:31:56] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> kagura checks out almost all the female characters
[2:32:01] <+AirMaster> my mans kagura checks out all the girls
[2:32:08] <+WhyIDie> a terrible GG backdash is still a good sf4 backdash
[2:32:11] <+jorgamund> he's checking out dem nutz

[2:37:06] <TigerClaws12> 4Head
[2:37:12] <%Fighter_Zeta> It's weird to me you're telling him to zone with Izayoi. It's good for stocks, but she's sooo good up close as well.
[2:37:22] <mistersups> Arakune is the reason BlazBlue won't get the Xrd 3D Treatment.
[2:37:32] <hitorio> Did I just wake up to see Blazblue Central fucking Fiction on WoolieVersus before going in to work?
[2:37:35] <+nakunattakage> Arakune combos look so sick
[2:37:39] <NumberTooBig> @mistersups venom looks good tho, its possible
[2:37:58] <haisho> @hitorio With a powerpoint presentation on how to approach anime fighters no less

[2:38:07] <%Greatnumber> @hitorio you're eyes are not lying to you, you missed a ted talk on anime fighters earlier though so when you are finished with work you might be able to check it out
[2:38:23] <landsharkRAWR> spider is a reversal
[2:38:26] <MTLxSpider> in guilty gear you can input delay
[2:38:34] <%Zanethepure> could they maybe make a stick that has a delay slider for practice?
[2:38:39] <BwdYeti> put the players on separate screens and delay the video for one player
[2:38:43] <EnderGamma> @woolieversus should have just used a shitty delayed monitor
[2:38:49] <+leviting> couldnt you use an RC phase shift?

[2:39:03] <landsharkRAWR> i havent played this in a while
[2:39:06] <%QueequegTheater> Does @WoolieVersus realize that adding a couple meters to the cord when electricity travels at the literal speed of light isn't going to create any lag?
[2:39:09] <hitorio> Dope. Totally will check out this archive - beautiful chat included.
[2:39:13] <+WhyIDie> to be a good arakune player, you have to have bad fundamentals
[2:39:23] <rsg220> TheSwitch3r....now that's a name I've not heard in a long time. A long, long time...
[2:39:26] <landsharkRAWR> tyty

[2:41:39] <SchlongKongEduardo> no
[2:41:40] <jsavarin> @WoolieVersus Valkenhayne is so weird. iHe doesn't have a lot of moves, but all of his moves are really good. He's hard to learn and totally worth it

[2:45:02] <jsavarin> @WoolieVersus If you want to understand the characters you play a little bit better i'd recommend the challenges. they teach you good combos and help understand which moves string

[2:47:33] <%QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus You have often talked about fightign games and their popularity relative to other genres like shooters, floating a couple theories as to why FGC never took off in the way Overwatch/MOBAs/FPSes did. I don't think I've heard you bring up this particular theory: in fighting games, the bronze tier is absolutely awful to be in, because it is purely a binary you lost/you won, while shooters, MOBAs, even SoulsBorne PvP always have the possibility of being carried when you're not good at t

[2:51:35] <CalderGaming> tfw both arcsys games have an "RC" but with different Rs
[2:51:37] <Dyson_Bladeless> lower your hp the faster burst comes back, also if you have active flow
[2:51:37] <randomness_yo> Jin is always busted
[2:51:44] <SunsetJack> Yes with active flow @WoolieVersus
[2:51:49] <Jibca> "jin" "busted"
[2:51:51] <kaine_west> Jin is especially busted in S2

[2:52:00] <Edgedark> jin is fair
[2:52:01] <+Ballthios> @mojomoud yea I just looked it up, you right, most of them are traditional lookin samurai, ninjas, or knights
[2:52:03] <%Greatnumber> @QueequegTheater Anime is just a Japanese word for animation, The Mario Brothers super show was an animated product. Thus it was a Western Anime. Checkmate.
[2:52:11] <mixel_stuff> If you burst it comes back slower if you overdrive it come back faster
[2:52:13] <%Zanethepure> GG Pedro
[2:52:15] <TigerClaws12> oof
[2:52:16] <Datwiseguy> active flow is grid in unist but its invisible

[2:52:26] <+Nomicro4u> Yeah but he got some good hits in
[2:52:27] <Jibca> active flow being invisible is legit just bad game stuff
[2:52:38] <Datwiseguy> what if guile and seigfried hasd a baby
[2:52:38] <%UrsulaCat> absolutely rwby is anime
[2:52:38] <+FadingEmber> RWBY is not anime don't @ me
[2:52:38] <SunsetJack> Burst comes back faster with a game mechanic called active flow where for 10 seconds, you do more damage and burst comes back faster @WoolieVersus
[2:52:41] <antthefool> Kill them all Woolie
[2:52:41] <Jibca> i'll concede that
[2:52:44] <%QueequegTheater> @FadingEmber
[2:52:48] <izaich> If I already own Guity Gear Xrd -SIGN-, is it worth spending $60 for Rev 2?
[2:52:55] <+Superkbrown95> May i ask what Woolie is playing on?
[2:52:57] <+Nomicro4u> I love these square faced chibis

[2:53:24] <+ChansonNoire> who knows
[2:53:25] <%QueequegTheater> RWBY features Vic Mignogna, Christopher Sabat, and Josh Grelle, and plays on JTV.
[2:53:25] <+spicystomp> your lifebar glows pink and it says it
[2:53:26] <Dyson_Bladeless> you get active flow for playing well
[2:53:26] <%QueequegTheater> ANIME
[2:53:26] <firesonicz> Does central fiction have a dead angle?
[2:53:27] <%Zanethepure> Active Flow occurs when you land the overdrive super or stay on the offensive
[2:53:27] <+Hilleltaco> Active flow is for being aggressive right?
[2:53:28] <izaich> I got -SIGN- on the Xmas Yogbundle, and have been digging it.
[2:53:29] <+FadingEmber> how dare
[2:53:31] <+AirMaster> estie de @MTLxSpider

[2:53:33] <FrustratedAF> woolie, reggie, aannddd?
[2:53:38] <deafmelone> its like the opposite of a negati
[2:53:39] <SunsetJack> Active flow is reward when you are SUPER offensive. The game will tell you with the word ATTENTION like a warning.
[2:53:40] <+Superkbrown95> @greatnumber thank you!
[2:53:40] <%Greatnumber> @FrustratedAF Pedro
[2:53:45] <Dyson_Bladeless> you get it for landing hits, using specials, blocking well, IBing well and making attacks whiff
[2:53:49] <deafmelone> negative penalty
[2:53:52] <Mattmandx1> Active flow is like reverse stun, it activates to reward you rather than punish your opponent after enough hits @WoolieVersus
[2:53:54] <FrustratedAF> thanks, greatnumber42069
[2:53:54] <Zinax7> random question for anyone who knows the answer, what was the main reason or person that when superbestfriends was still together that they didnt play blazblue?

[2:54:00] <kaine_west> REAL players
[2:54:05] <izaich> You need Revelator for Rev 2, right? Just have -SIGN, so I have to dole out the full 60.
[2:54:10] <%Zanethepure> @WoolieVersus did you like the Johnny color for Kagura?
[2:54:16] <Gonewiththevoid> they liked guilty gear better. and spite.

[2:55:29] <JoshuaVv0> DO IT
[2:55:32] <SunsetJack> @WoolieVersus Barrier is an important block mechanic. It pushes the opponent more and blocks air unblockable moves and guard crush.

[2:56:31] <%Zanethepure> DP against Overdrive will beat their OD super and any option they try to start with other than block, but the tradeoff is that if they block that DP the punish will be even harsher
[2:56:32] <TigerClaws12> oof
[2:56:36] <Mattmandx1> @Animal_Farm4 The MHA manga came out 2 years before this game was released

[2:57:01] <SunsetJack> 5B are normally air unblockable.

[2:59:11] <gunstar73> This is a Mexi beam character
[2:59:23] <waifoong98> AW ALMOST
[2:59:23] <JoshuaVv0> Lambda is a hyrbid too just she sucks at it lmao
[2:59:24] <%Greatnumber> Always sometimes never bet on DBZ
[2:59:28] <%Zanethepure> @WoolieVersus I'm glad Pedro went Ragna vs Me, as bad as Ranga v Kagura is, Kagura vs Mu is hell
[2:59:30] <MacMog> Touhou? In my anime?
[2:59:31] <+supahrob64> That Hazama has to much hops
[2:59:34] <%QueequegTheater> @MacMog You're lucky you don't have that you don't have the windchill Chicago does. The downtown is built in essentially a perfect grid with so many tall buildings sunlight doesn't reach most sidewalks, so every street becomes a wind tunnel
[2:59:36] <Zerotoad5> @WoolieVersus there a lot of gundam reference in BB every izayoi move is a gundam thing
[2:59:44] <+goose_attack_almanac> Noel plus thong and more zoning
[2:59:47] <+goose_attack_almanac> love it
[2:59:48] <Gonewiththevoid> thuggery move was landed i am satisfied
[3:00:00] <waifoong98> They changed explosion to launching
[3:00:03] <stormhawk9891> Nope
[3:00:03] <+spicystomp> very much not so
[3:00:03] <+theAncopro> NOPE
[3:00:04] <kiraellion> hwo did they get woolie to even glance at blaz blue
[3:00:05] <deafmelone> no
[3:00:07] <%Zanethepure> @WoolieVersus did someone say woolieLORE ?
[3:00:07] <didgereedoodah> nope
[3:00:07] <+Pat_Squared> No Hazama is an asshole
[3:00:08] <DizzyNecr0> Hazama is still bad
[3:00:09] <Animal_Farm4> No Hazama is also an asshole LUL
[3:00:10] <+TruSpindash> They're both jerks
[3:00:11] <Dyson_Bladeless> Hazama is cool
[3:00:14] <+mashinchaserr> he can be worse
[3:00:14] <%QueequegTheater> Is Hazama Lautrec
[3:00:20] <LandOfTheWay> @WoolieVersus i can answer lore, sorta. hazama's not as bad as terumi, but he's definitely a prick
[3:00:24] <SunsetJack> @WoolieVersus The biggest advantage of doing combos while in overdrive is that they CANNOT burst.
[3:00:24] <+leviting> no they're both assholes, but hazama is more chill
[3:00:27] <NumberTooBig> Hazama did nothing wrong :)
[3:00:27] <Gonewiththevoid> nope hazama is also an asshole. just a different kind
[3:00:30] <%Fighter_Zeta> Hazama is just Terumi with restraint anyways
[3:00:32] <Festtag> Terumi steals Ragna's sister, puts her into the god machine, her soul gets split and from the shards they create Noel, Nu and Lambda. Terumi and Relius then turn Noel into Mu
[3:00:38] <waifoong98> DIRTBAGS
[3:00:40] <%Zanethepure> welcome to anime zone/keepaway
[3:00:41] <Mattmandx1> Hazama is just a body made for him kinda like M. Bison. Hazama is super evil on his own but he's more chill than Terumi
[3:00:53] <EXonestar> hmmm waiting for someone
[3:00:55] <%Zanethepure> Hazama is smooth criminal, Terumi is Dr Disrespect
[3:00:55] <+theAncopro> hazama is a smug asshole, terumi is a loud asshole
[3:01:02] <%QueequegTheater> Japan and blatant copyright infringement, name a more iconic duo
[3:01:07] <Dyson_Bladeless> Yo I better get my turn dysonbSnoking
[3:01:13] <+pr0at> @WoolieVersus whens dong dong?
[3:01:15] <+mashinchaserr> Hazama's a sociopath with and without terumi iirc
[3:01:15] <+Hilleltaco> I feel like Terumi's run might have helped, it's pretty fast. Maybe that'd be reckless though, I'm a bad Terumi
[3:01:17] <+Ballthios> Hazama is every anime character with snake lookin eyes
[3:01:23] <kaine_west> Pure fightin' games Kreygasm Kreygasm
[3:01:25] <NumberTooBig> @QueequegTheater Rockman and Roll Kappa
[3:01:28] <waifoong98> @QueequegTheater China and Copyright Kappa
[3:01:29] <antthefool> Y‚Äôall are selling me on hazama
[3:01:39] <Gonewiththevoid> playing terumi reckless is the only way to play terumi
[3:01:53] <deafmelone> hazama is just gin ichimaru
[3:01:54] <+Tonku_the_Red> Hazama was just a body to house Terumi. Once Terumi left, Hazama's soul was too corrupted by Terumi to return to normal and became a sort of toned down Terumi.
[3:01:55] <waifoong98> LUL

[3:02:56] <%QueequegTheater> @Geno4344 This is also true
[3:02:56] <+supahrob64> Friendly reminder that Jubei slept with Nine (the sexy motherfucking witch)
[3:03:01] <waifoong98> he now super dash
[3:03:10] <+Pat_Squared> I look forward to them ruining him in any future game
[3:03:15] <Mattmandx1> @supahrob64 She got the pussy instead of the other way around
[3:03:19] <%QueequegTheater> When does Spec Ops: The Line start
[3:03:20] <EXonestar> never seen a half these ppl online before in my life lol
[3:03:22] <%Fighter_Zeta> It's canon in BlazBlue that catgirls are made through cross-species love, yes
[3:03:25] <EXonestar> new players ?
[3:03:33] <%QueequegTheater> I need someone to suffer with me through that game
[3:03:35] <lbrownthedestroyer> Pad players ???
[3:03:40] <%Zanethepure> 2DB after 2C is more reliable
[3:03:42] <Game_King7797> what sentient squirrel birthed makoto
[3:03:43] <NumberTooBig> anyone else play samurai and pizza cat in crosstag Kappa
[3:03:50] <Dyson_Bladeless> dude right zak
[3:03:50] <Edgedark> people literally picking up the game just to fight woolie on this night
[3:03:56] <Zerotoad5> @EXonestar I think some people legit bought the game to play woolie
[3:03:57] <%Zanethepure> 6DC after 2C will drop on some characters
[3:03:59] <deafmelone> chipmunk creature
[3:04:01] <waifoong98> @NonAddictiveSlurm sticking to Tag Kappa
[3:04:03] <Gonewiththevoid> makoto and her kind were actually made to fight the Black beast
[3:04:04] <nutimik> Does Jubei have a spiky dong like real cats?
[3:04:05] <TigerClaws12> @Fighter_Zeta what about the squirrel girls tho nathanPepe
[3:04:09] <Datwiseguy> usually roll is super rough though
[3:04:11] <nutimik> Cause that must've been unpleasant for her
[3:04:15] <%UrsulaCat> I feel so fucking blown out
[3:04:19] <+supahrob64> @Edgedark We've been around, it's only now that people won't laugh at us
[3:04:28] <+Tonku_the_Red> @nutimik Don't worry about it.
[3:04:29] <Gonewiththevoid> the bb world is full of anime animal persons with enhanced ohysicals
[3:04:37] <%Fighter_Zeta> Wouldn't be surprised
[3:04:51] <%QueequegTheater> When is the RE2 start
[3:04:54] <+solphum> it's hard to set the pace of play with a fireball against rushdown characters like jubei
[3:04:56] <Malik1002> @woolieversus watch your head bro you getting opened up
[3:04:58] <Festtag> Daisuke doing his thing on the soundtrack
[3:05:04] <+solphum> unless you already knocked them down and it's the oki setup
[3:05:09] <MavMedic81> Yo-yo Woolie. Giving my love and support.
[3:05:19] <TigerClaws12> what is going on NotLikeThis
[3:05:19] <Mattmandx1> Jubei is the strongest mortal character in the series lore. Hakumen in his prime was the only one who was maybe a match for him
[3:05:23] <waifoong98> LUL
[3:05:25] <%QueequegTheater> @TigerClaws12 ANIME
[3:05:34] <Datwiseguy> jump like a monkey
[3:05:36] <waifoong98> Jubei is dash @WoolieVersus
[3:05:37] <nutimik> Damn Jubei is fucking badass
[3:05:39] <%Zanethepure> Jubei is like MVC2 Cammy
[3:05:41] <Gonewiththevoid> and then Susanooh showed up and trashed him
[3:05:42] <%Zanethepure> a pixy
[3:05:48] <Jibca> "busted buttons"
[3:05:50] <+xGreenflame> Jubei has an install super that let's him do crazy shit
[3:05:54] <%Zanethepure> catman gets all over you
[3:05:57] <%Greatnumber> He wasn't double perfected, He won!
[3:06:09] <+solphum> yea susan ended blazblue. please get excited for blazblue 2 starring Tsubaki in the susanoo unit armor
[3:06:09] <JoshuaVv0> @Edgedark did you actually get your alt on here lmao
[3:06:09] <kiraellion> jubei is the fst
[3:06:10] <%QueequegTheater> Sharkgirls > Catgirls
[3:06:19] <MacMog> Jubei wears the Lovely Eyepatcu
[3:06:19] <Jibca> that's not edge's alt
[3:06:20] <Edgedark> what alt
[3:06:24] <Festtag> @WoolieVersus Jubei has a berserker barrage and mixup specials. He can use an install that turns his berserker barrage into a rekka that can cancel into any of hiis mixup options
[3:06:25] <Edgedark> that's jibca
[3:06:28] <JoshuaVv0> WHAT
[3:06:28] <Jibca> >.>
[3:06:29] <kiraellion> Maid Sharkgirls > Catgirls
[3:06:35] <MavMedic81> What‚Äôs up from southern Ontario!
[3:06:39] <JoshuaVv0> l m a o
[3:06:47] <Edgedark> yeah I'm in 2 spots in the line
[3:06:49] <Jibca> hi
[3:06:50] <haisho> Bullet time
[3:06:58] <JoshuaVv0> My bad
[3:07:01] <+solphum> you only get active flow if you hit them with exceed accel
[3:07:01] <%Zanethepure> @WoolieVersus just remember if you hold block on Overdrive the OD super won't happen. Big Important, gotta let go of block to use it
[3:07:07] <Jibca> its okay im trying to play a lot less
[3:07:07] <+solphum> get it right away*
[3:07:13] <Jibca> but the weather is forcing me to stay inside
[3:07:16] <$Superdandy96> Best luck to those about to fight!
[3:07:17] <Jibca> and canceling classes
[3:07:17] <+Ballthios> when's a Guilty Gear X Blazblue game happening? that'd be sick (or horrible who knows)
[3:07:19] <Mattmandx1> Overdrive into Accel is super punishable by Dp's though
[3:07:21] <Jibca> so ive got nothing better to do
[3:07:22] <+supahrob64> Cmon Bullet, show that we exist!
[3:07:24] <Game_King7797> my perverted eye
[3:07:24] <waifoong98> LUL no Kokonoe yet
[3:07:25] <Jibca> and its been actually fun
[3:07:26] <haisho> wait is that a fucking Motoko color?
[3:07:34] <%QueequegTheater> @Jibca Play Spec Ops: The Line
[3:07:35] <SunsetJack> During active flow, if you do the hold OD attack, it does 4k instead of 2k
[3:07:37] <%Zanethepure> it is Motoko
[3:07:38] <%QueequegTheater> It's fucking good
[3:07:56] <+Tonku_the_Red> Freaking Bullet Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[3:07:59] <deafmelone> if i play imma play a bad azreal
[3:08:00] <NumberTooBig> @Ballthios Red team would have to texture BB's rotoscope models since Blue team would have to make new sprites LUL
[3:08:03] <mixel_stuff> @woolieVersus its all good i just started playing jubai
[3:08:09] <deafmelone> as in not good
[3:08:10] <JoshuaVv0> idk who to play
[3:08:10] <Jibca> nah ive been doing a lot of smogon USUM OU stuff
[3:08:17] <JoshuaVv0> prolly rel just cuz who the fuck else would
[3:08:19] <Jibca> i actually enjoy Pogo ou meta more atm tho
[3:08:34] <Jibca> its a nice simplicity
[3:08:35] <%Greatnumber> It's happening
[3:08:36] <%Zanethepure> got him with the Helm Breaker
[3:08:41] <Dyson_Bladeless> Zak are you still here
[3:08:42] <nutimik> All of Bullets moves do less damage than what it looks like they should do
[3:08:43] <waifoong98> awww
[3:08:47] <%QueequegTheater> @Jibca No but do it tho
[3:08:52] <%Zanethepure> @WoolieVersus 2C on hit go to 2DB
[3:08:59] <%CaptainPileDriver> this game is actually kinda fun.
[3:09:01] <+Ballthios> @NonAddictiveSlurm LUL I didn't even think about how the graphics would work out
[3:09:19] <Datwiseguy> netplay dong dong when
[3:09:20] <Mattmandx1> Bullet has been bottom tier since this game launched
[3:09:27] <+supahrob64> To those who don't know, if you let Bullet play her game and they know what they're doing, Bullet can actually be really good
[3:09:27] <MacMog> take THAT, animu sword
[3:09:28] <Jibca> idk about bottom tier bullet
[3:09:29] <JoshuaVv0> since hse launched
[3:09:31] <Jibca> but she's not good
[3:09:36] <+supahrob64> But most of the time the opponent outclasses her
[3:09:38] <jsavarin> ullet has to go into buff state to do damage, and she's really in a fine spot damage wise seeing how good her frame data becomes once buffed
[3:09:42] <Jibca> the threat of that damage is p real
[3:09:43] <NumberTooBig> PogChamp
[3:09:44] <+Ballthios> @Mattmandx1 top tier waifu though can't deny that
[3:09:44] <%QueequegTheater> God I hate anime fanservice so much
[3:09:44] <%Greatnumber> whoah mama
[3:09:51] <Hoarseplay> Bullet is definitely bottom 5.
[3:09:51] <Datwiseguy> i thought she moved to lmd onvce ppl learned more about this version
[3:09:52] <Festtag> Bullet still does great damage without buffs
[3:09:55] <NumberTooBig> sfhOK
[3:09:59] <Festtag> The crucial thing is her dash and flint shooter range
[3:10:02] <+Pat_Squared> My only problem with BB has always been that whenever I find a new character they change them so much in subsequent sequels or patches that I dont enjoy playing them anymore
[3:10:12] <+solphum> poor bullet. so hard to get started, and then the heat stacks disappear before not too long.
[3:10:16] <theordinarypenguin> Bullet is probably like the worst character in the game but i love her anyways
[3:10:20] <%Zanethepure> neutral range with Kagura is the toughest part of his gameplay outside of handling zones
[3:10:26] <Silversunburst> God i love anime fanservice so much
[3:10:29] <nutimik> Quee I understand where you're coming from, but try not to let boobs get in your way of enjoying things
[3:10:30] <didgereedoodah> Tao exists, so Bullet can't be the worst
[3:10:38] <xiccy> @queequegtheater It's the worst. She should be way cooler than she the fanservice makes her
[3:10:39] <JoshuaVv0> Nah Celica and Terumi are def worse
[3:10:41] <stingray53_1> gg woolie
[3:10:42] <JoshuaVv0> Tao may be too

[3:12:39] <+StromkoPenguin> I think the degree of Jill jiggle depends on what outfit you put her in. You can put her in the suit if you want zero (hetero) sex appeal whatsoever. :D

[3:14:37] <stormhawk9891> This guy
[3:14:37] <sandwichtaker> Anyone in the chat know who the guy in the middle is
[3:14:44] <SunsetJack> Aw, wanted to play a round, oh well.

[3:15:20] <LandOfTheWay> @shadowmaksim his personality ain't all that edgy, but him using blood attacks is
[3:15:21] <Hoarseplay> Ragna isn't even that edgy. He's just a dude always down on his luck and he swears a lot.
[3:15:22] <NightKillerX123> unga yikes
[3:15:23] <Dyson_Bladeless> idfk i havent been watching
[3:15:24] <negativejam> yeah, he's a chuuni weeb LUL
[3:15:24] <Mattmandx1> Naoto is a good boy who helps anyone he sees
[3:15:25] <%Zanethepure> Azrael can Yamazaki your projectiles
[3:15:27] <MacMog> @Stromko there‚Äôs a town named Hell in Michigan
[3:15:27] <Edgedark> @WoolieVersus I've actually been a fan for years, thanks for playing dude
[3:15:29] <%QueequegTheater> I MIGHT LIVE IN IDAHO BUT I'LL ALWAYS BE FROM PLANET VEGETA (YES I'M A SUPER SAIYAN)
[3:15:35] <kyros01> did you play already dyson?
[3:15:37] <%Zanethepure> it crushes all other projectiles
[3:15:38] <Gonewiththevoid> i once saw BlazBlue accurately described as "Every anime ever made"
[3:15:39] <Dyson_Bladeless> no
[3:15:40] <Dyson_Bladeless> I wanted to bully
[3:15:45] <Dyson_Bladeless> but they're gonna switch games or something
[3:15:46] <JoshuaVv0> edge ruining our fun
[3:15:51] <%Greatnumber> LETS GO
[3:15:52] <Dyson_Bladeless> feelsbadman
[3:15:53] <pandangerous> I'm just happy to see some naoto
[3:15:54] <+VektorTroika> THERE'S A PLACE FOR ME IN IDAHO, IT'S CALLED RECARDLESS
[3:15:55] <waifoong98> "game" Kappa
[3:16:08] <+spicystomp> jiyuAzrael
[3:16:09] <LandOfTheWay> @Edgedark you are the hero anime needs
[3:16:11] <MacMog> my own private Idaho
[3:16:24] <MTLxSpider> @Edgedark are you shield hero irl
[3:16:28] <kiraellion> the styling on you was just a complament wollie
[3:16:38] <Edgedark> is this where I plug my combo video
[3:16:38] <Datwiseguy> woolie you amlost got blown up for that burst
[3:16:42] <Jibca> yes
[3:16:43] <xiccy> Thats actually something I DON'T like about BB. The other big anime fighters have a particular style and even when they pull from other anime they try to keep it similar to their style. BUT BB JUST HAS A DUDE FROM AoT! WHY?!
[3:16:43] <Jibca> yes it is
[3:16:51] <NightKillerX123> i bettrr see double weakpoint combos
[3:16:59] <negativejam> LUL
[3:16:59] <Datwiseguy> whens ping pong combos
[3:17:05] <%Zanethepure> this fight is hard, Az shuts down your oki game pretty hard and has generally better buttons
[3:17:07] <nutimik> I need to see Woolie fly across the stage
[3:17:13] <+Hilleltaco> Azrael apatBig flash step
[3:17:14] <%Menitta> Are combo videos the same as soundclouds for FGC?
[3:17:16] <%CaptainPileDriver> i mean, bb is modern anime, its fine
[3:17:18] <Edgedark> yes
[3:17:28] <%Fighter_Zeta> BB is just turning cool battle manga tropes into mechanics
[3:17:38] <bursky00> every character in BB are basically hey look i like that character how about I make my own,
[3:17:39] <Game_King7797> body invul
[3:17:43] <Mattmandx1> @xiccy It's to pay homage to all types of action anime so every player will have at least one character that appeals them
[3:17:50] <Mattmandx1> *to them
[3:17:51] <Dyson_Bladeless> I didnt get a game
[3:17:51] <stormhawk9891> Awwww I was hoping for Azrael's Astral
[3:17:51] <xiccy> UNI is too but it keeps it's own style.
[3:17:52] <+supahrob64> @Fighter_Zeta Wow, that's actually the best way to put it
[3:17:54] <Dyson_Bladeless> lemme fight once lmao
[3:17:55] <+solphum> wake up flash kick isn't really a thing from emergency tech (when you flash white). delay tech is best if you want to wake up dp as kagura
[3:17:57] <Dyson_Bladeless> gawdamnit
[3:17:59] <JoshuaVv0> w a c k
[3:18:02] <waifoong98> Aw no 9 or Izanami
[3:18:10] <%QueequegTheater> Are we streaming Spec Ops: The Line now
[3:18:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> ZAMASU IS ABSURD IN DBFZ
[3:18:15] <%Zanethepure> Wakeup flashkick is only if you emergency tech or quick getup since you need to hold down :(
[3:18:18] <mr_miyagichu> Rip no match for me
[3:18:19] <%Fighter_Zeta> I like the end result but I see why some think it's generic
[3:18:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> HIS INTRO IS A FULL MONOLOGUE
[3:18:20] <NightKillerX123> i wanted to see dyson play
[3:18:22] <%Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus Wool really wants a match, he's 3 people away woolieREMEMBERS
[3:18:23] <+VektorTroika> remember when Rufus' joke wasn't funny? now it's double unfunny
[3:18:25] <+Hilleltaco> Bedman best quotes
[3:18:25] <kaine_west> GG blazblue stans
[3:18:33] <NightmareTerumi> Oh man I'm too late D:
[3:18:36] <MacMog> The Switcher?
[3:18:42] <LandOfTheWay> @WoolieVersus take a look at bedman's winquotes in ggxrd if you wanna see quotes that go on for hours
[3:18:42] <JoshuaVv0> Check our the Kag discord
[3:18:45] <Dyson_Bladeless> Literally who Kappa
[3:18:48] <DaisyFannn> @AirMaster
[3:18:53] <+Ballthios> yea that's why GG appeals more to me than BB; GG has a more specific feel it aims for
[3:19:05] <Datwiseguy> wait we platinf 12,5?
[3:19:08] <%Zanethepure> @WoolieVersus Kagura is hard so you can expect a lot of tough battles, but he himself is very fun
[3:19:12] <+samthegreat9> airmaster avec ses day 1 combos

[3:19:28] <MTLxSpider> airmaster c combo c flashkick
[3:19:29] <%QueequegTheater> TFW the BB lobby does chibi artstyle better than the actual game of Salt and Sanctuary
[3:19:33] <%Zanethepure> Ooooh Kuso time
[3:19:37] <%Menitta> @Wool At least throw Ruby under the bus too
[3:19:38] <nutimik> Touhou? More like Garbou OpieOP
[3:19:38] <xiccy> @bursky00 But they don't make them their own they just transplant them one to one with very little attempts to personalize it.
[3:19:41] <EnlightenedKramer> Touhou!
[3:19:41] <kiraellion> two hoes. he traded it for MAHVEL
[3:19:42] <Mattmandx1> @Ballthios Bedman and bridget seem to have a very different artistic feel than Potemkin and Leo to me though
[3:19:43] <%QueequegTheater> Spec Ops: The Line stream now

[3:20:00] <%QueequegTheater> YEYEYEYE
[3:20:00] <AggsMK7> IDAHO
[3:20:00] <Datwiseguy> hey jojo http has balance
[3:20:06] <ShinobiPhoenix> people pushing Dark Souls on me is why I didn't play Dark Souls for so long. still haven't actually played
[3:20:11] <EnlightenedKramer> I D A H O
[3:20:26] <%UrsulaCat> too loud
[3:20:28] <kaine_west> SHIRTS PogChamp DansGame
[3:20:32] <nutimik> yea, loud music
[3:20:32] <%QueequegTheater> @ShinobiPhoenix Try it out, it's a rare game that is both punishing and not all that punishing
[3:20:41] <Mattmandx1> YOUDAHO
[3:20:43] <%QueequegTheater> But if ti's not your thing, I totally understand
[3:20:43] <%Greatnumber> Since we are at a break, going to post it again to keep it on. TedTalk at the beginning of the stream about how to get into Anime Fighters from the second guest Pedro. Here it is m8's: https://twitter.com/pochp_/status/1090436881534369793
[3:20:46] <+VektorTroika> JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE IS FROM IDAHO, IT DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE A SPECIAL KIND OF TWISTED
[3:20:50] <+Ballthios> @Mattmandx1 a lot of them do, they did a fantastic job at not having too much overlap between characters in that regard
[3:21:05] <+Ballthios> yea this interim music is pretty darn loud
[3:21:09] <nutimik> LUL (yes I'm a super saiyan)
[3:21:15] <%QueequegTheater> RECARDLESS
[3:21:23] <$KnivesEve> okay are these shirts actually real?
[3:21:24] <+mimikyu92> look at these disgustingly edgy shirts
[3:21:31] <%QueequegTheater> They're the best
[3:21:35] <+Hilleltaco> I'd be too much of a coward to use these shirts because I'd be afraid of someone thinking I was serious
[3:21:39] <nutimik> how many fonts can we fit on 1 shirt?
[3:21:39] <Elsewize> Recardless?
[3:21:47] <%Greatnumber> at least 3
[3:21:52] <EnlightenedKramer> IDAHO!!
[3:21:56] <+chesterr01> BrokeBack
[3:22:10] <kaine_west> Where did he find these and where can i find more of them to laugh at
[3:22:10] <AzureKayZ> I just got here, are they still playing Buraburu
[3:22:15] <%QueequegTheater> THE MAN ON THAT SHIRT LITERALLY JUST MURDERED THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
[3:22:16] <+badmr7> oh god these are always funny
[3:22:16] <nutimik> nope
[3:22:22] <+Hilleltaco> @AzureKayZ They just stopped
[3:22:28] <+StromkoPenguin> There's a special place in Hell for me it's called Special Ed.
[3:22:35] <%QueequegTheater> WHY WOULD ANYBODY LOOK UP TO MAJIN VEGETA
[3:22:48] <AzureKayZ> Now I am in pain
[3:22:58] <Mattmandx1> Kirby just napping in the corner with all this edge on the other side of the screen
[3:22:58] <kaine_west> @AzureKayZ No more Blazblue
[3:23:04] <kiraellion> shape of an M on your forehead~
[3:23:07] <AzureKayZ> But was Woolie playing Susanoo tho
[3:23:17] <%Greatnumber> Mainly Kagura
[3:23:26] <Mattmandx1> @AzureKayZ He was liking Kagura a lot
[3:23:29] <%QueequegTheater> But Goku isn't kind, he constantly offends his wife by talking about her age
[3:23:48] <AzureKayZ> Yeah I can see that.
[3:23:54] <+chesterr01> IZAYOI IS SO COOL
[3:23:55] <kiraellion> im supremely surprised hes not trying to stick with susanoo
[3:23:59] <+Hilleltaco> I wish I could get in with Kagura if only to try and show off his max unlocked super
[3:24:06] <+Hilleltaco> I mean susanoo
[3:24:06] <%xeromage> reCARDless
[3:24:09] <+Hilleltaco> whoops
[3:24:12] <MacMog> Smash Switch should have started with only Kirby selectable
[3:24:13] <EnlightenedKramer> idaho
[3:24:15] <+Ballthios> well Goku IS brain damaged so
[3:24:21] <%QueequegTheater> Yo for real tho that's a dope song
[3:24:26] <MacMog> and when a new challenger approaches, it‚Äôs the light beams again
[3:24:27] <kiraellion> Susan vs Susan matches are the best
[3:24:38] <Mattmandx1> @kiraellion Susano'o is really weird and slow. I tried him for a while but called it quits after a big losing streak
[3:24:43] <MacMog> and if you get hit, Kirby gets erased
[3:25:06] <AzureKayZ> Susan: Which one will hit 5B first
[3:25:07] <deafmelone> I messed up by not playing when i had a chance
[3:25:44] <%QueequegTheater> Everyone knows Dark Souls II is the truest fighting game
[3:25:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> yeah, if you like boring characters
[3:25:59] <%QueequegTheater> Lucatiel > Solaire don't at me
[3:26:01] <kiraellion> the only advice i can offer is level what you need
[3:26:21] <%QueequegTheater> Or do, because I'm fucking right
[3:26:41] <FrenchTact1cs> These fucking shirts are slaying me
[3:26:55] <+Ballthios> honestly Dark Souls 2 was the first DS I beat but I still ended up liking Dark Souls 1 better
[3:26:57] <%Greatnumber> Here we go!
[3:26:58] <EnlightenedKramer> FOOOOZIES

[3:32:01] <%Zanethepure> this looks like decisions the fighting game
[3:32:01] <ShinobiPhoenix> @jorgamund I think it's literally saying "whiff punch" because it happened after a punch was thrown and missed (a whiff)
[3:32:05] <PlumpPotatoRump> that tech was gdlk
[3:32:07] <NumberTooBig> @Geno4344 its ONLY shotoclones Kappa
[3:32:10] <+Ballthios> that 3d camera pan PogChamp it's just like Xrd PogChamp
[3:32:11] <kiraellion> to many big tiddied anime girls games sucks.

[3:33:21] <Zantetzuken> let him do the thing BabyRage

[3:33:49] <+nharliecash> whens nidhogg?
[3:33:49] <+LordJimmyBones> Oh i know this game
[3:33:52] <+7oasty> Blazblue looks different from what I remember.

[3:34:20] <MacMog> BIT.TRIP BLAZ BLUE

[3:34:23] <rsg220> when's Negan coming to foozies?
[3:34:27] <%Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus Could Lethal League Blaze fit in GIFG? woolieOMG
[3:34:57] <kaine_west> ^ agreed
[3:35:26] <Datwiseguy> is this available online?
[3:35:26] <+Ecchigun> we losing viewers :(
[3:35:27] <MTLxSpider> i play that game
[3:35:33] <+mimikyu92> what is this???
[3:35:34] <%Zanethepure> this game is all decisions and very little tech. boiled down to a simple formula like this it's almost RPS level counterplay
[3:35:39] <kiraellion> a portal opens and geralt steps through
[3:35:52] <MTLxSpider> if you want this guy ask pochp_ on Twitter (middle guy)
[3:35:55] <+nharliecash> @Ecchigun we're whittling away the excess carbon to get a diamond audience
[3:35:55] <MTLxSpider> he made it
[3:36:01] <$Superdandy96> @ecchigun holy crap, your right. Pat and Max just drained all the viewers PogChamp
[3:36:08] <MacMog> it‚Äôs an abstract fighting game
[3:36:15] <+Ballthios> what's the tier list for this game? Kappa
[3:36:22] <Rhyolite_> I really love the concept behind this game
[3:36:23] <MTLxSpider> Sweep S tier
[3:36:25] <MTLxSpider> free
[3:36:27] <+LordJimmyBones> lmao
[3:36:31] <+Ecchigun> sweep top tier
[3:36:37] <+LordJimmyBones> sweep
[3:36:44] <Rhyolite_> helps you determine who is the better player fundamentally speaking
[3:37:01] <+Ecchigun> no tittes, no gimmicks : FOOZIES
[3:37:07] <ShinobiPhoenix> So you could watch two people play Resident Evil 2 instead of playing it yourself or you can stay here and get LESSONS in how not to suck in fighting games
[3:37:08] <Rhyolite_> ^^^
[3:37:10] <EnlightenedKramer> @ecchigun I can't believe they sucked off so many fans! TehePelo
[3:37:24] <+Ecchigun> TehePelo
[3:37:33] <+nharliecash> just like shawn michaels
[3:37:33] <kiraellion> all three characters are big tiddy anime girls. what are you talking about
[3:37:33] <%Greatnumber> You can also get hot powerpoint info from the guy in the middle named Pedro: https://twitter.com/pochp_/status/1090436881534369793
[3:37:56] <+Ecchigun> music volume is too high
[3:38:00] <+Ecchigun> cant hear anything
[3:38:01] <Rhyolite_> I love how you capitalized LESSONS as though it's a horrible thing Kappa
[3:38:06] <+nharliecash> yeah its hard to hear you guys
[3:38:11] <+Ecchigun> @WoolieVersus
[3:38:15] <+Ecchigun> my stream experience
[3:38:15] <Rhyolite_> nah I can hear pedro
[3:38:17] <+Ballthios> I can hear them fine, but it is a tad bit loud
[3:38:50] <%Zanethepure> @WoolieVersus are throws crouchable or do they hit crouch
[3:38:50] <MTLxSpider> OUPS
[3:39:01] <+Ecchigun> OOO
[3:39:07] <Rhyolite_> I feel like this is a type fighting game that helps you get better at other fighters, or at least get a better sense of them
[3:39:08] <%Greatnumber> Pedro's balls going to be exposed?
[3:39:11] <PlumpPotatoRump> :o
[3:39:21] <+Ecchigun> 3D
[3:39:22] <+nharliecash> jimmybones you made him too powerful
[3:39:24] <MTLxSpider> Ayyy

[3:41:42] <JumboMan214> What is happening
[3:41:44] <%Greatnumber> @WoolieVersus When is this coming to mainstage evo?
[3:41:48] <%Zanethepure> @WoolieVersus this song sounds like it would accompany the sickest of gains at the gym
[3:42:07] <MacMog> the Z ordering of the UI elements makes me sad
[3:42:19] <PlumpPotatoRump> what's dashes downside? it can get hit dashing in?
[3:42:24] <mangocoal01> What game is this?
[3:42:26] <PlumpPotatoRump> dash's*

[3:42:46] <+nharliecash> this is blazblue central fiction
[3:42:56] <MTLxSpider> thats why you wanna play sweep. cuz his sweep has more range than a normal attack
[3:43:06] <MTLxSpider> lol
[3:43:30] <%Greatnumber> @mangocoal01 This game is called FOOZIES made by p0chp the guy in the middle

[3:44:07] <mangocoal01> @greatnumber Thanks for explaining.
[3:44:10] <MacMog> it‚Äôs an abstract fighting game, like chess is an abstract wargame
[3:44:35] <%Greatnumber> Just copy and pasted an earlier post, but you are welcome all the same m8.
[3:44:41] <MTLxSpider> oh yeah. walkback is slower than walking foward

[3:46:42] <Iamjustabox> I'm impressed Arcsys managed to backport their Xrd end of match 3D camera revolution to BlazBlue
[3:46:52] <+Ecchigun> bagled
[3:47:05] <%Greatnumber> It's pretty insane that it hasn't been added to BBTag tbh
[3:47:11] <42nfl19> wait what game is this?
[3:47:13] <+Odin_777> showed up for blaze blue, stayed for the PIXELS SON
[3:47:17] <Rhyolite_> I think 3D fighting games is a whole different in itself compared 2D fighters
[3:47:21] <%Greatnumber> @42nfl19 This game is called FOOZIES made by p0chp the guy in the middle
[3:47:28] <42nfl19> noice

[3:48:45] <PlumpPotatoRump> lool
[3:48:48] <CalderGaming> woolie might as well be shang tsung because he keeps showing up as different black men with dreads
[3:48:51] <Rhyolite_> nice
[3:48:57] <ShinobiPhoenix> plant is only out if you already registered your code a while back
[3:48:59] <MTLxSpider> ayyy
[3:49:20] <CalderGaming> you can still register your code on the estore right now and get piranha
[3:49:33] <PlumpPotatoRump> :o

[3:50:11] <%Greatnumber> Stop pressing buttons
[3:50:14] <42nfl19> where can we try out this game?
[3:50:25] <+Ballthios> @CalderGaming I'm hoping Barkley 2 gets finished eventually :(
[3:50:28] <ShinobiPhoenix> but I feel like playing this helps understand Smash too, I need to improve my footsie game in that, I keep getting grabbed after dashes and not understanding how to hit box I getting me so far away
[3:50:41] <MTLxSpider> you can tweet him at pochp_ to get the game
[3:50:50] <MTLxSpider> since he made it
[3:50:58] <%Zanethepure> @WoolieVersus if you had the budget and staff to make your own fighting game, but you can only have 10 characters and they all have to be pre-existing fighting game characters, and 2D only. Who would you put in that game
[3:51:09] <+Nyterayce> what is this beautiful art
[3:51:15] <CalderGaming> @Ballthios name checks out
[3:51:38] <+Ballthios> @CalderGaming you're the only person to notice thus far, I love you <3
[3:51:38] <MTLxSpider> Pedro mic is a bit low
[3:51:52] <Rhyolite_> there's a part of me that wants to see this game overthrow Windjammers at EVO
[3:52:04] <Rhyolite_> (sorry Windjammer fans.) Kappa
[3:52:12] <%Zanethepure> very tough question I know. no need to answer, I've always wanted to Mugen my mains in every game just to try playing them vs one another, bizzaro world Match ups is what I mean
[3:52:26] <%Greatnumber> The Dozens of us would be very angry
[3:52:27] <CalderGaming> reggie's head is wide open and woolie's deep in there
[3:52:27] <42nfl19> @MTLxSpider wait your name is familiar, wen I googled Foozies I saw a vid of you playing the game on twitch.

[0:20:43] <WG101> @Cavumentum the fuck's a vriska?
[0:20:43] <+Nomicro4u> Just start fresh
[0:20:46] <ccrida> Wait if woolie is wearing her pants whose wearing the pants in the relationship?
[0:20:47] <Tampaoster> DARKEST SOULS?
[0:20:48] <+TintainiumCan> We going DLC or no DLC?
[0:20:53] <+NarcissistCactus> get those dlcs
[0:20:56] <ElenaManetta> Crimson DLC is fucking bullshit
[0:20:58] <Hydrolion1998> DD is such a good game sfhOK
[0:20:58] <UrsulaCat> @WG101 don't worry about it
[0:20:59] <ElenaManetta> Makes the game worseeee
[0:20:59] <vinarto> Is it modded?
[0:21:00] <gunstar73> Start fresh
[0:21:00] <+runegod20> was the last time you played before the last DLC?
[0:21:01] <UnknownGerm> yeah, this game is great but it has very high quantities of bullshit
[0:21:02] <dukenux> You don't just "beat" DD
[0:21:03] <%xxMylord> woolieGASM
[0:21:05] <+TintainiumCan> cause man am I not a fan of Crimson Court
[0:21:08] <+DK_Rance> crimson sucks dont use it
[0:21:11] <+blastazoid26> Good I need a break from RE2, that gives me anxiety.
[0:21:16] <$HentaiSenpai9K> cheer1 There's an awesome DD mod that adds Guts to the game
[0:21:16] <Tampaoster> vanila time? or everything?
[0:21:18] <+Nomicro4u> Going back into a save is brutal because you don't remember half the things and your people die and you lose money
[0:21:19] <Partrap> where you get these headphones?
[0:21:21] <+DomunDomunDomun> Install them shindoL waifu mods. apatSmug
[0:21:22] <flyingtarantulaz> The dark souls of Woolie streams
[0:21:22] <%SWFanatic> I like the design of crimson court but not the gameplay
[0:21:29] <Fruitywhompus> "probably"
[0:21:29] <GoldeNOVA> HOT MINUTE
[0:21:34] <lordxanothos> First time catching a live from any of you hooligans, and it's for Dankest Dungeon.This pleases me.
[0:21:38] <TheEnablerr> Probably? Assuredly.
[0:21:40] <$HentaiSenpai9K> @swfanatic Yeah it's the worst
[0:21:43] <Hydrolion1998> Nier Automata? sfhBLIND
[0:21:45] <CheapImitations> no
[0:21:45] <+TintainiumCan> @SWFanatic the art is godlike, but yeah, mechanically it ruins the whole game for me
[0:21:46] <%Cavumentum> Hardest difficulty, all DLC, no torches or food
[0:21:46] <+vdalson> I could not get into darkest dungeon no matter how many times i attempted it. then i turned off the crimson court, and it all suddenly felt so much better
[0:21:48] <+DK_Rance> yea yea all the bs with the 3s
[0:21:48] <Bennett_Fracture> i was aboot to stream soul calibur 6 but... i really want to support the local talents right now...
[0:21:52] <Tampaoster> nier autotomato?
[0:21:52] <Bennett_Fracture> get em woolie...
[0:21:55] <ConLin_Plays> Dankest Dungeon!!
[0:21:55] <+blastazoid26> @woolieversus Do you have DLC on in your save?
[0:21:57] <gunstar73> Shindol fedHYPER
[0:21:58] <ElenaManetta> not for play play
[0:21:59] <supersparta333> Yeyeye
[0:22:01] <UrsulaCat> YEYEYEYE WOOLIAM TIME
[0:22:05] <ObsidionRob647> Hey Woolie! From Toronto!! Massive fan!!
[0:22:05] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> at this point it'd be faster if you just did them all man
[0:22:08] <gunstar73> Moth girls fedHYPER
[0:22:10] <RossMirage> Are you gonna kill the subs today? xD
[0:22:12] <ElenaManetta> GOOD
[0:22:12] <+Nomicro4u> Crimson Cournt isn't bad, but if you haven't played the base game I can understand the frustration
[0:22:18] <$HentaiSenpai9K> @domundomundomun I see you're also a man if culture
[0:22:21] <ElenaManetta> i regret buying the DLC
[0:22:22] <alexandrecau> automata the new Naruto lp, neverending
[0:22:23] <triplemred> Oh boi, here we go going crazy again!
[0:22:26] <%Chichen> @WoolieVersus you dont. You can activate later.
[0:22:36] <+DomunDomunDomun> You can enable the DLC for existing saves, pretty sure.
[0:22:39] <AlasterAngelo> @WoolieVersus remember that overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer
[0:22:40] <+TintainiumCan> Still waiting on the Color of Madness for Switch too, dunno what's taken Ninty so long
[0:22:41] <+DomunDomunDomun> Just can't turn it off after.
[0:22:42] <fairore> hi woolie
[0:22:43] <+blastazoid26> No, that's totally fine. base game is better for me
[0:22:44] <+NarcissistCactus> you can just enable it whenever
[0:22:48] <ConLin_Plays> man, I haven't played DD in a long while now
[0:22:52] <ElenaManetta> I got DD with all the DLC and activated it all at once having never played it, assuming DLC just meant more content
[0:22:52] <AngryPhant0m> @WoolieVersus honestly how many skin miods do you have
[0:22:52] <lordxanothos> Fuck the Shindol skins; instal the Dark Souls character mods. Ornstein and Artorias, baby
[0:22:53] <+EndgameContent> Color of Madness is already on Switch
[0:23:00] <+fatal_penguin_> Balls deeo
[0:23:01] <+fatal_penguin_> deep
[0:23:02] <ElenaManetta> it's so goddamn difficult, way more than it should be
[0:23:04] <+0bsydian> first time viewer, your kirby headphones are amazing
[0:23:05] <+runegod20> i haven't played much DD since my laptop stopped being able to run the game as well a few months back
[0:23:06] <MavMedic81> Yo Woolie!!!
[0:23:07] <UnknownGerm> I'd vote for not opting into the DLC because you might start at a point where the game is expecting a LOT from you
[0:23:08] <@mothmandraws> no death speedrun no pressure

[1:01:32] <@mothmandraws> this is woolies memories of me as support in Overwatch clearly
[1:01:46] <$RilsRislan> You're a healslut and you know it
[1:01:46] <%UrsulaCat> support is the only valid class
[1:01:48] <+fatal_penguin_> But I'm already Mercy
[1:01:48] <FrustratedAF> i guess the devs wouldn't want you grinding delicious pork products for your journies
[1:01:49] <%LethargicRush> also for supply just stock up some antidote and herbal medicines to clear any food tables and also for brew you find.
[1:01:54] <MarylandJutsu> but at least you can summon cthulu this time @mothmandraws

[1:03:46] <Demon_JW> @WoolieVersus hey woolie did you know the narator of this has audio books of lovecraft books :)
[1:03:49] <FrustratedAF> @UnknownGerm Are you telling me we can pet dogs in this game to reduce stress?
[1:03:52] <+GN93> @WoolieVersus do you have an opinion on that new ANTHEM game? have you tried the demo yet?
[1:03:54] <%GingaNZ> in the wrong spot
[1:04:02] <%LethargicRush> iron swan is super good
[1:04:03] <XxCGxOblivionxX> The narrator of this is a confirmed Touhou fan
[1:04:17] <@mothmandraws> does this game have "random loadout" mode
[1:04:18] <%SWFanatic> #getrektpacing
[1:04:20] <AggsMK7> It's all about mitigating the RNG
[1:04:20] <%SoGetOnTheBomb> Wowee Pet the dog Wowee
[1:04:32] <+SneakTheBeak> apatJpeg
[1:04:32] <UnknownGerm> FrustratedAF totally can. The dog can howl in battle to stress heal the whole team, and you can pet the doggo as a camping skill to also stress heal
[1:04:37] <AggsMK7> Don't forget torches
[1:04:40] <%hmgirlpopuri> Inventory management is also Woolie's life. He would have made a great middle manager somewhere
[1:04:40] <%LethargicRush> antidotes and herbal medicines

[1:09:52] <Brainworm205> There are so many cool character mods for this game. Biggest reason to play on PC imo
[1:09:52] <XxCGxOblivionxX> The fact that ShindoL made fucking Darkest Dungeon mods is unreal.

[1:13:14] <%BlitzChocula> man, having my pigs getting demonically mutated is exactly why I left the farming scene.
[1:13:17] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I think they once were men, actually
[1:13:19] <$Tuskor13> Puke Pig is the worst enemy in the whole game

[1:17:10] <$megamonmon123> if there is no thuggery its a failure
[1:17:11] <+YabbaTroll> you could use an item
[1:17:12] <KTDelgado> use medicine
[1:17:15] <%SWFanatic> You forgot the cookies?!
[1:17:18] <MyNameIsRasus> That's right, we are craving Smash

[1:17:32] <%QueequegTheater> COWARD OUT

[1:17:38] <GohanEgret> @slix343 yeah
[1:17:38] <$megamonmon123> btw been playing re2. thats a good ass game
[1:17:42] <MyNameIsRasus> No more Dong Dong
[1:17:44] <futa_friday> pretty sure herbs give you food
[1:17:44] <+runegod20> herbs is either big loot or big foo
[1:17:46] <%QueequegTheater> Burn it
[1:17:49] <paint_it_black25> eat scraps
[1:17:49] <%SoGetOnTheBomb> Medicinal herbs rule in the Warrens, you can pretty much forgo buying any food
[1:17:52] <+sogeki_dan> Woolie, we need smash, and you need to take a big shit in your pants mid fight with Pat.
[1:17:58] <$megamonmon123> re 2 is the darksouls of survival horror games
[1:17:59] <snow_bush> @MyNameIsRasus I guess dong dong did die
[1:18:02] <amychibi> !uptime
[1:18:07] <%QueequegTheater> WHOOPS
[1:18:09] <Maniamax> No 'erb
[1:18:10] <amychibi> how long has woolie been on?
[1:18:11] <bestwaifuritsu> We dont deserb it
[1:18:11] <Will9099> dong dong will live on in our hearts
[1:18:12] <%BlitzChocula> its crazy to think the same company that made the RE2 remake also made MvCI.
[1:18:13] <CirclesForever> !downtime
[1:18:14] <+runegod20> i think the quirk removal thing for the warrens uses herbs too
[1:18:15] <Faustgesicht> Wasted food
[1:18:17] <slix343> I heard like his brothers broke it or something
[1:18:18] <AggsMK7> About an hour
[1:18:21] <MyNameIsRasus> @snow_bush But certainly they existed
[1:18:23] <GohanEgret> @amychibi 1h 10m
[1:18:24] <slix343> Is that his origin story?
[1:18:26] <%SoGetOnTheBomb> FrankerZ
[1:18:30] <+mechslayer71> @blitzchocula Different teams tho
[1:18:31] <+CrystalTree07> Warrens is mostly Herbs
[1:18:31] <amychibi> has he killed any boss yet?
[1:18:33] <$megamonmon123> @runegod20 is this a my hero spin off?
[1:18:45] <rufus2k2> @BlitzChocula Except that Capcom didn't have disney breathing down their neck while making RE2
[1:18:46] <AggsMK7> Use Hound's Harry
[1:18:47] <GohanEgret> @slix343 I think it was a cousin
[1:18:53] <%GingaNZ> When was stealth added? with the spear girl?
[1:19:00] <%Cavumentum> Yeah
[1:19:03] <bigbradish> Your doggo cant sniff them out?
[1:19:04] <%CEGold> Idk why but this makes me want to play This War of Mine
[1:19:07] <amychibi> guys has woolie killed any boss?
[1:19:09] <+runegod20> group attacks hit stealth as long as there's a non stealth person being hit as well
[1:19:11] <$megamonmon123> let it rock
[1:19:13] <lloyddboy> remember when traps could go off even when you had over 100% chance to disable Kappa
[1:19:15] <%BlitzChocula> @rufus2k2 oh right. forgot they literally had the biggest company in the world on their back lmao. Terrible comparison on my part.
[1:19:20] <$megamonmon123> #LetItRock
[1:19:31] <MyNameIsRasus> #LetItRock
[1:19:32] <$megamonmon123> is there a let it rock emote yet?

[1:29:04] <eggsnbakefest> I only just recently beat the game for the first time, actually
[1:29:05] <@mothmandraws> hey dont complain
[1:29:07] <SnaKemuho> but how much do you have to grind to get to that point
[1:29:07] <%kshatriyahdraws> try fgo to test that rng
[1:29:07] <@mothmandraws> I got big heals
[1:29:09] <+mechslayer71> @eggsnbakefest Oh, I was talking xcom 2. Yeah, you can get the first upgrades pretty quick in two, especially War of the Chosen.
[1:29:12] <$megamonmon123> @ccrida i think you are already crazy lol
[1:29:16] <%Cavumentum> $20 and a box of cookies
[1:29:17] <MyNameIsRasus> Greed was the best homunculus
[1:29:17] <ccrida> Not greedy if he keeps healing 25+
[1:29:19] <+fatal_penguin_> The Herpes
[1:29:25] <snow_bush> @kshatriyahdraws Atleast wait till a good banner is up for that
[1:29:26] <Gutsandlove> @WoolieVersus have try the mod chracters in the workshop, i recommend the SLAYER
[1:29:28] <$HentaiSenpai9K> @eggsnbakefest Then you haven't experienced the true XCOM. You should get on that's
[1:29:30] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> "Slow reflexes and tetanus? That's alright, get in."
[1:29:32] <%UrsulaCat> afraid of the dark
[1:29:37] <@mothmandraws> also woolie juggn4n4ut said he would answer questions about fisticuffs discord
[1:29:37] <%OthoZen> i knew that rusty nail was no good
[1:29:38] <%SoGetOnTheBomb> FeelsGoodMan
[1:29:38] <eggsnbakefest> I actually used to want nothing to do with Xcom 2, but after watching War of the Chosen, I REALLY wanna play it
[1:29:40] <gunstar73> 1k minimu
[1:29:47] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Not so bad, really
[1:29:49] <%kshatriyahdraws> @snow_bush YES
[1:29:49] <$megamonmon123> is there a class in this game where more diseases buffs you?
[1:29:49] <joylent_blue> thats a pretty good negative quirk honestly
[1:29:51] <zafooru> you... did it
[1:29:51] <Rincewind1998> I think going new weapons first is better, because the lower enemy HP early on means you can more easily kill them all before they even hit you
[1:29:57] <%QueequegTheater> Lucatiel tho
[1:29:59] <%SoGetOnTheBomb> Put me in the brothel coach, I need some relaxation
[1:30:14] <$Jugg4n4ut> @woolieversus we started the discord the week after the boys split up, mainly because we love fighting games and missing having fighting games to look forward to watching on fridays. so we decided to make the discord and every week we do a vote on what game to play together
[1:30:15] <+mechslayer71> @eggsnbakefest War of the chosen just makes he game better in every way, but it’s a lot to take in, even over the base game
[1:30:17] <@mothmandraws> ye woolie dont forget lucatiel
[1:30:23] <%PrimePedantry> heyo woolie woolieSMUG
[1:30:35] <damiensiegfried> but he's an abom, they're meant to borf
[1:30:36] <%kshatriyahdraws> vaccinate
[1:30:41] <%QueequegTheater> Remember her name damn it
[1:30:42] <%OthoZen> Mr Madden i dont feel so good woolieTRASH
[1:30:43] <eddiemayfly> @megamonmon123 None of the official classes. Perhaps a mod class, but I wouldn't count on that.
[1:30:43] <slix343> Can one of you guys request me to be a char? I want Woolie as my lovecraftian boss
[1:30:47] <%QueequegTheater> she deserves it
[1:30:55] <FrustratedAF> holy shit that's a roster
[1:30:56] <eggsnbakefest> Yeah, it seems like it. But it also seems to make the game way more interesting, and I wish I could shill out the $100 for the bundle
[1:30:57] <@mothmandraws> the dog needs a drink
[1:31:00] <%DedlokPM> @mothmandraws Luca who? teenHMM
[1:31:05] <$HentaiSenpai9K> The only downside with War of the Chosen is the huge install size. it's like 50gb.
[1:31:10] <+fatal_penguin_> So are we getting 2nd Gig of Line-Kill! Spirits next week, Woolie
[1:31:10] <$megamonmon123> @eddiemayfly fair enough, i just like the idea that super aids gives you huge buffs
[1:31:11] <%QueequegTheater> @DedlokPM HOW DARE
[1:31:13] <+runegod20> ooo, that's really bad for a graverobber too
[1:31:17] <%SoGetOnTheBomb> FeelsGoodMan
[1:31:23] <damiensiegfried> i can imagine the guillermo del toro eldritch woolie design
[1:31:23] <$megamonmon123> never let stds rock kids
[1:31:29] <%DedlokPM> @QueequegTheater apatJpeg
[1:31:34] <%OthoZen> beer for the man vodka for the dog
[1:31:35] <XxCGxOblivionxX> DOG IS GETTING DRUNK
[1:31:36] <+GN93> does the dog get beer too?
[1:31:38] <+mechslayer71> @eggsnbakefest Oh yeah, I got base xcom 2 for free on PS plus, and then bought the dlc, so entry was way cheaper. But the game runs like shit, so LUL
[1:31:42] <%QueequegTheater> LUCA LUCA
[1:31:42] <%kshatriyahdraws> like me after finals and observations hours
[1:31:45] <%SoGetOnTheBomb> One for me, one for the FrankerZ
[1:31:48] <joylent_blue> apatJpeg
[1:31:49] <%QueequegTheater> damn it woolie
[1:31:53] <Adam_ET> Oh shit, Darkest Dungeon!
[1:32:00] <damiensiegfried> title drop
[1:32:05] <damiensiegfried> roll credits
[1:32:11] <+gralho> is this normal mode?
[1:32:13] <$HentaiSenpai9K> All in all I think Xcom 1 with Long War is way better than Xcom 2
[1:32:16] <eggsnbakefest> Eugh, not so great. Maybe one of these days I can get it on PC, when I'm not rolling in empty wallet
[1:32:16] <ccrida> inb4 everyone dies on the first floor of the darkest dungeon
[1:32:20] <Pointdot> Title drop
[1:32:22] <MyNameIsRasus> Is it Nier later or is it Soul Calibur with 2B?
[1:32:22] <burninggrey> How many lads have fallen in the Madden Estate?
[1:32:23] <Pointdot> The game starts now
[1:32:27] <Adam_ET> How long has he been playing?
[1:32:30] <@mothmandraws> should be nier later
[1:32:30] <UnknownGerm> okay, I know you went for honest trial and error for this game but I HIGHLY recommend looking up what goes on in the Darkest Dungeon before you head in
[1:32:32] <eggsnbakefest> I'll give Long War a try next chance I get
[1:32:40] <$HentaiSenpai9K> About 1. 5 hour
[1:32:43] <$megamonmon123> @burninggrey as much that could fill the horison
[1:32:47] <$Jugg4n4ut> @woolieversus we have been trying to think of a new name for the group because we didnt just want to take the name and idea of FNF since you guys started it, but we wanted to carry the spirit of FNF (a bunch of guys just getting together friday night and duking it out in fighting games)
[1:32:48] <Adam_ET> gotcha
[1:32:52] <UnknownGerm> the game pulls some shit you will literally never see coming
[1:32:54] <damiensiegfried> @WoolieVersus may we see the graveyard?
[1:32:54] <SolSwagGuy56> Woolie how dark is this dungeon
[1:33:03] <%QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Name one of the Grave Robbers Lucatiel, it's close enough: big hat, badass lady, and Lucatiel's sword scales more with DEX
[1:33:17] <$Jugg4n4ut> ok
[1:33:19] <AggsMK7> There is a tall and wide wall between the rest of the game and the Darkest Dungeon.
[1:33:21] <$megamonmon123> yeah id probably just steal from people rather than go into the dungeon. whats a dude with a gun compared to an eldrish horror
[1:33:27] <eddiemayfly> @megamonmon123 There's a handful of class modders with upcoming classes, so maybe MarvinSeo, H-Purple or Morgaine might have a similar idea. Or maybe you could make a proposition to them.
[1:33:29] <@mothmandraws> ye one of those would be good pick for luca
[1:33:33] <$Jugg4n4ut> @woolieversus my bad. will do.
[1:33:33] <damiensiegfried> @SolSwagGuy56 not too dark. more a metaphorical dark
[1:33:45] <GMN1> pro tips
[1:33:48] <$megamonmon123> @eddiemayfly i havent played this game yet so i wouldnt wanna distract em
[1:33:54] <MyNameIsRasus> MLG tips
[1:34:07] <+mechslayer71> @eggsnbakefest It’s turn based and I’ve only ever played on console, so I can deal with it, but it’s honestly embarrassing taking into account how the game looks, when it came out and what other games run like on PS4. Plus the bugs that are still present two years later, it’s kinda inexcusable. But the actual game is great, so I put up with it
[1:34:10] <@mothmandraws> looks kind of like peach in a hat
[1:34:14] <$HentaiSenpai9K> There's mods to actually put Lucatiel, Solaire, Artorias, and Vellstad as classes
[1:34:29] <damiensiegfried> there are
[1:34:31] <$megamonmon123> @mothmandraws not enough mustard stains
[1:34:32] <@mothmandraws> I think ive seen some warhammer versions
[1:34:38] <@mothmandraws> but dunno if its just fanart
[1:34:47] <%QueequegTheater> @mothmandraws I think Paige would like Lucatiel considering the game implies she fences with that big fuckoff greatword (meaning she is BIG AND STRONG)
[1:34:49] <eggsnbakefest> Yeah, that's fair, I can get that. All I've got is my PC, so my options are completely limited
[1:34:51] <damiensiegfried> there are warhammer versions
[1:34:58] <+runegod20> the samurai has been my favorite custom class, though it's kind of busted with the amount of dodge and damage it can build
[1:34:58] <eddiemayfly> @HentaiSenpai9K Also Gwyndolin.
[1:35:00] <AggsMK7> Don't forget Lucatiel
[1:35:02] <damiensiegfried> even mlp versions, if i remember correctly
[1:35:07] <honestab33> DoritosChip DoritosChip DoritosChip
[1:35:08] <$HentaiSenpai9K> My favourite is Guts mod tho. He's so OP
[1:35:11] <FrustratedAF> BlessRNG for good heals
[1:35:12] <eggsnbakefest> Alright, I gotta dip, get stuff done. Peace out, @WoolieVersus and chat!
[1:35:15] <%QueequegTheater> Lucatiel > Solaire, don't @ me
[1:35:20] <XxCGxOblivionxX> Don't forget our lord and savior ShindoL of 177013 fame!
[1:35:21] <$megamonmon123> @hentaisenpai9k what debuffs does he have?
[1:35:29] <joylent_blue> eggsnbakefest have a good one apatJpeg
[1:35:33] <+mechslayer71> @eggsnbakefest Oh, everything I was saying for the PS4. I hear the game is way better on pc
[1:35:57] <misterbarkley> fucc

[2:09:06] <KTDelgado> HE HAS A HELMET... HE CANT BE STUNNED
[2:09:10] <%QueequegTheater> I just want to point out Lucatiel did the most damage
[2:09:11] <ccrida> Fix your order
[2:09:16] <+adequacyquest> but they love quarters
[2:09:24] <Mr_Strut> Duelist advance + holy lance = PAIN TRAIN
[2:09:24] <matrignomy7> Remember to fix your order!
[2:09:24] <alexandrecau> no quarter, only nickel
[2:09:25] <joylent_blue> brought low, and driven into the MUD
[2:09:25] <snow_bush> NO THOTS, ONLY GLORY
[2:09:27] <FrustratedAF> i like this team. they seem like Big Strongs
[2:09:35] <LongwinterCipher> No quarter; dimes hurt the most.
[2:09:36] <%UrsulaCat> why did I say that
[2:09:37] <%QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Tarkus should also be tanking
[2:09:37] <cafeapathy> 'Deviant Tastes' is a debuff? I'd die in this world.
[2:09:38] <GarbageQueenEllie> Slay the THOTS, take back the Holy Land
[2:09:53] <%QueequegTheater> Swap out heal for tank, vestal is already top tier healer
[2:09:54] <+mechslayer71> @queequegtheater Don’t worry, she’ll job soon enough, just like the real Lucatiel Kappa
[2:10:02] <%QueequegTheater> @mechslayer71 You stop that
[2:10:08] <%QueequegTheater> She never canonically jobs
[2:10:11] <LocDogX86X> Heyoooo Everyone !!! gooSTEVE
[2:10:16] <%SWFanatic> @cafeapathy Deviant Tastes = Banned from the Brothel for stress healing
[2:10:19] <cafeapathy> hi locdog
[2:10:21] <simulationbard> @cafeapathy Deviant Taste disallows stress healing in the brothel
[2:10:35] <MyNameIsRasus> It means he kinky

[2:11:20] <MyNameIsRasus> Does Clemps have Deviant Tastes?
[2:11:22] <%SWFanatic> shoulda brought a plague doc
[2:11:28] <ccrida> Get rid of the stun skill for healer
[2:11:30] <joylent_blue> risk it for the biscuit
[2:11:33] <+mechslayer71> @queequegtheater I don’t know man, why does she go hollow when the player character never even shows any debilitating mental effects no matter how bad it gets? When you think about it, all the npc’s who go hollow are jobbers. Even Solaire Kappa
[2:11:38] <%DashXero> But this is Darkest Dungeon. RNG ensures that the potential for drama is maximized even if you are super well-prepared.
[2:11:38] <+adequacyquest> he makes ends meet
[2:11:53] <%kshatriyahdraws> wohooo
[2:11:57] <Enryuan> TBh im here to chill you can do what you think it's fun

[2:23:02] <joylent_blue> passing turns builds stress
[2:23:05] <faegbeard> is the a reason that you don't have highwayman at the front at the start of the battle for the point blank shot as an opener?
[2:23:05] <simulationbard> Passing turns cause stress tho

[2:26:30] <%LethargicRush> confirmed
[2:26:34] <%QueequegTheater> Tarkus try to block their attacks to Lucatiel with your organs
[2:26:46] <MyNameIsRasus> Tarkus is not good with precipices
[2:26:49] <TheEnablerr> "God loves me not u"
[2:26:50] <%SWFanatic> This is why you bring plague doc and blight dots
[2:26:50] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Tarkus, Bastilla and Lucatiel? LUL Did he give up naming after subs or did they die already?
[2:26:52] <cafeapathy> hey. hey. he has a scarf too!
[2:26:53] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> YIKES
[2:26:57] <gryffinp> That's actually really good
[2:27:02] <%QueequegTheater> YEYEYEYE
[2:27:03] <nutimik> combat healing is almost always worse than stunning or killing
[2:27:06] <Daxalog> Pickaxe penetrates armor
[2:27:11] <ravencloak13> If only it was a Stand Arrow! Then Tarkus would get a Stand!
[2:27:20] <+RavenGlock> Who guards the guardsmen?

[2:29:37] <gunstar73> Shoot the j woolie fedRager
[2:29:39] <joylent_blue> i'm sure theres a mod that makes all skills switchable during battle
[2:29:42] <gryffinp> God, Woolie's having so much trouble dealing with backliners now, and he's heading off to fight the necromancer lord
[2:29:44] <ccrida> FINALLY A LUNGE
[2:29:49] <%QueequegTheater> FINALLY
[2:29:50] <raminnoodle420> YEEE
[2:30:07] <%QueequegTheater> Oh look Lucatiel is the anchor Kappa

[2:30:16] <%QueequegTheater> SHADOW FADE THO
[2:30:20] <ccrida> JUST ADVANCE
[2:30:35] <%QueequegTheater> SHIT
[2:30:39] <+mechslayer71> @queequegtheater Exactly, she’s holding the team back KAPPA
[2:30:39] <joylent_blue> fak
[2:30:40] <Impeachedpear3> has he beaten any dlc bosses yet?
[2:30:43] <+mechslayer71> Kappa*
[2:30:46] <Chester_goes_Berserk> Duel advance > Point blank be the rotation
[2:30:48] <Impeachedpear3> i woild imagine so
[2:30:54] <%QueequegTheater> @mechslayer71 >not knowing what an anchor is
[2:30:54] <gunstar73> Just shadow fade
[2:30:59] <AlasterAngelo> esto es el fin
[2:30:59] <Stofil42> this team kills things so slowly
[2:31:07] <Battleduk> I need to get better at this game
[2:31:09] <+mechslayer71> @queequegtheater not knowing what a joke is
[2:31:19] <KTDelgado> pretty inefficient team
[2:31:23] <Daxalog> Point Black, huh?
[2:31:25] <AggsMK7> Point BLACK
[2:31:25] <cafeapathy> open up the door it's [too] real
[2:31:25] <%QueequegTheater> @Stofil42 Mostly because Woolie forgot to lunge
[2:31:31] <+mechslayer71> @queequegtheater or what Kappa is for, even tho I spelled it wrong
[2:31:35] <ccrida> @Stofil42 because woolie isn't using skills effectively like lunge
[2:31:39] <FrustratedAF> 23?!!
[2:31:41] <cumurasame> lucatille mvp
[2:31:44] <%LethargicRush> god i hate quarrel
[2:31:45] <NDenizen> Born just in time to delve dank dungeons
[2:31:46] <%DashXero> He does NOT like Bastilla for some reason.
[2:31:54] <gryffinp> This is gonna be one of those runs that hinges entirely on if the healer pops virtuous
[2:31:54] <SpydaK> He'll figure it out
[2:31:55] <+lyfeindeyth> did he custom name bastilla?
[2:31:56] <cafeapathy> yay!!
[2:32:00] <Tampaoster> you can just pass the turns woolz
[2:32:05] <%QueequegTheater> @mechslayer71 Actually, I used it right. It's for confidence/condescension
[2:32:09] <nutimik> kill the corpses instead and heal up
[2:32:10] <Stofil42> @ccrida pickaxe would have been fine for the big guys though, probably even better
[2:32:11] <alexandrecau> welp, fuck healing rounds
[2:32:11] <joylent_blue> passing turns builds stress
[2:32:13] <%QueequegTheater> It's all in good fun
[2:32:27] <%TRILLTURBAN> lol
[2:32:28] <+jorgamund> Jebaited
[2:32:33] <Ropcord> Jebaitedf
[2:32:33] <AggsMK7> If you run the clock too much, it builds stress too
[2:32:34] <simulationbard> Eat the gold
[2:32:34] <Ropcord> fuck
[2:32:35] <%mgs3ladderscene> lmao
[2:32:36] <%DashXero> That's some Deal or No Deal shit there...
[2:32:40] <gunstar73> Why woolie aleksChill fedLUL
[2:32:42] <+Jahshine> Destroy corpses to pass time, like we all used to do when we were kids.
[2:32:44] <+mechslayer71> @queequegtheater I was talking about my kappa actually, I spelled it wrong so it didn’t show up
[2:32:53] <gustavozxd> did woolie play any re2?
[2:32:53] <cumurasame> god tarkus has so much hp
[2:32:56] <cafeapathy> "all this gold is heavy to carry..if only we had something lighter...like paper...or credit cards....or digital bitcoins"
[2:33:05] <%QueequegTheater> Crusader and Vestal both have good stun
[2:33:08] <gunstar73> Needs healing rounds instant kill
[2:33:14] <TheEnablerr> sometimes he says
[2:33:24] <nutimik> Crusader & Vestal
[2:33:27] <joylent_blue> gustavozxd i don't think re is woolie's cup of tea
[2:33:32] <nutimik> Especially Vestal
[2:33:35] <%QueequegTheater> Roll the dice she'll get a virtue
[2:33:37] <simulationbard> Ib4 bone courtiers
[2:33:38] <PlumpPotatoRump> Oooh the stream layout is dooope
[2:33:44] <gunstar73> Take off heal on tarkus
[2:33:44] <%QueequegTheater> It'll be fiiiiine
[2:33:49] <nutimik> She should be stunning as much as healing

[3:03:36] <LucidInDarkness> LUL Damn
[3:03:38] <soulkarl> doesnt mean shes still not the worst class currently
[3:03:40] <gryffinp> DoTs are the best
[3:03:40] <djbrooks603> They blind yo
[3:03:43] <%QueequegTheater> ILLITERACY IN SKELETONVILLE IS A SERIOUS ISSUE JIM
[3:03:44] <GMN1> "haha we can't read, fucker"
[3:03:44] <gunstar73> They can’t read
[3:03:45] <+DK_Rance> @eddiemayfly i love his normal work so i lost my shit when i saw he was making DD mods i cant wait for the others i think im most hype for duchess coming soon and eventually apostate that little mushroom dude
[3:03:47] <Iam_Dead> They don't have eyes LUL
[3:03:48] <zk_nails> PogChamp
[3:03:51] <XxCGxOblivionxX> BONES DON'T READ THE MANGA
[3:03:53] <GarosTepes> That's what I like to call big healing.
[3:03:56] <joylent_blue> they can't read they don't have EYES
[3:04:01] <eddiemayfly> TFW Woolie, who prefers busts, isn't using the Omen Seeker.
[3:04:06] <LucidInDarkness> @soulkarl I'd say Jester and Occultist currently aren't doing so hot. Graverobber is just above them
[3:04:07] <+Verd_254> oh man that's the funniest thing i've heard. They can't fuckin read.
[3:04:08] <+A_mere_shrubb> Bones Skipped to Part 5

[3:04:22] <%Cavumentum> Too busy with the necropants and not-incest from Star Allies
[3:04:25] <Mr_Strut> The undead are anime secondaries
[3:04:27] <Fyrijou> KH3 is out bois!
[3:04:29] <+TheSwinns> Blessed is the mind too small for doubt
[3:04:31] <dukenux> BLIGHT U APP
[3:04:31] <soulkarl> occultist is still near the top
[3:04:31] <caribbean_samurai> BONES NEVER SAW JOJO
[3:04:35] <eddiemayfly> @DK_Rance Gotta be honest, I much prefer the Doomslayer. Not that the Omen Seeker is not appreciated.
[3:04:37] <soulkarl> jester also low tho - i agree
[3:04:39] <%LethargicRush> wooow
[3:04:47] <caribbean_samurai> BURN THE BONES
[3:04:50] <%blaccbird914> Big Numbers!
[3:04:51] <soulkarl> hes mostly just there to heal sanity - hes at least great for color dlc
[3:04:52] <%QueequegTheater> ADVANCED CQC
[3:04:56] <Iam_Dead> Just had to go a little crazy to get ok
[3:04:56] <Mr_Strut> Surprisingly effective for an afflicted healer
[3:05:02] <%LethargicRush> you can't guard the poison!
[3:05:02] <LucidInDarkness> @soulkarl Not in terms of consistency. Flagellant is better overall for healing
[3:05:10] <joylent_blue> she might be fearful, but shes pushing thru
[3:05:12] <%QueequegTheater> @soulkarl I disagree, he's great for building up a single enormous hit
[3:05:22] <ccrida> LUNGE
[3:05:26] <gryffinp> Blight that bow fucker more
[3:05:28] <%LethargicRush> 7
[3:05:30] <+PenmanLupine> 7
[3:05:31] <%QueequegTheater> BOOOOO
[3:05:32] <soulkarl> occultist is an offhealer... hes got very consistent damage, stun, and debuff
[3:05:33] <XxCGxOblivionxX> BONES = ANIME ONLY

[3:06:00] <soulkarl> like 2 off healers work nice - like flag + occultist
[3:06:02] <eddiemayfly> OVERCONFINDENCE etc...
[3:06:04] <simulationbard> Occultist for the big heals, Vestel for consistency
[3:06:06] <%LethargicRush> wow big crit
[3:06:08] <+OceanGovernor> I love the clown pasta
[3:06:09] <LucidInDarkness> Let me put it like this. Just because a class can do work from tiem to time doesn't mean someone else doesn;t do it better or require you dropping someone to bring them @soulkarl
[3:06:11] <+DK_Rance> @eddiemayfly he is pretty awesome i deny never stop ripping or tearing
[3:06:12] <%QueequegTheater> That seems like a wasted crit
[3:06:26] <joylent_blue> sick jukes
[3:06:36] <ccrida> Bastilla pls
[3:06:37] <%DashXero> It's blit, fam.
[3:06:37] <%Doodle_Taco> haha dead weight you get it
[3:06:40] <PlumpPotatoRump> yo dis shit is Blit
[3:06:42] <%LethargicRush> jud
[3:06:44] <soulkarl> naw the problem w/ graverobber is she does nothing better than anyone else - she basically doesnt have a proper niche currently
[3:06:45] <Stofil42> noo use judgement
[3:06:45] <%LethargicRush> gement..
[3:06:46] <+DK_Rance> @eddiemayfly dont*
[3:06:47] <%QueequegTheater> stay high
[3:06:56] <LucidInDarkness> Vestal plus Flag or any self healer is more than enough to not play off of bleeds and rng heals from Occul @soulkarl
[3:06:58] <ccrida> POINTO BLANK
[3:07:01] <%QueequegTheater> Man, this is actually an amazing comp for pure DPS
[3:07:02] <Faustgesicht> Dat skelly is Blit yo
[3:07:04] <+manwithboxonhead> More like Blighted and lit.
[3:07:08] <hookhis> bleetz for day, brudda
[3:07:12] <+Razmooten> mo blite, throw dem darts
[3:07:13] <soulkarl> the bleeds from occult should never hit...
[3:07:20] <%QueequegTheater> 25 on a noncrit WTF
[3:07:20] <Stofil42> @soulkarl she's this weird high-risk damage character but bounty hunter just does it way better
[3:07:23] <+A_mere_shrubb> The craziest part about this game is that there is a steam workshop for it, some of those classes are really cool
[3:07:28] <simulationbard> You gotta bring a off healer if your using Occultist
[3:07:29] <ccrida> READING RAINBOW
[3:07:33] <alexandrecau> means you're a tad wan
[3:07:33] <XxCGxOblivionxX> THEY READ THE MANGA
[3:07:33] <soulkarl> bounty hunter is also bad tho lol
[3:07:36] <joylent_blue> TAKE A LOOK
[3:07:36] <djbrooks603> NOW YOU KNOW
[3:07:38] <Iam_Dead> PogChamp Literacy
[3:07:39] <joylent_blue> ITS IN A BOOK
[3:07:40] <Mr_Strut> It's in a book

[3:07:49] <simulationbard> Bounty Hunter is good with a mark party
[3:07:51] <%QueequegTheater> WHY WOOLIE
[3:07:52] <%king_wragles> Illiteracy is my shield!
[3:07:59] <%GarbageNirvana> Not a sports page, not a magazine, but a book
[3:07:59] <%UrsulaCat> destroys a body?
[3:08:03] <+PenmanLupine> @WoolieVersus use the firewood before you open the chest
[3:08:05] <simulationbard> So is occultist come to think of it
[3:08:06] <CurrySauseBandit> Some o dat, "Hooked on Jezus" in their lives LUL
[3:08:07] <caribbean_samurai> LUL
[3:08:10] <LucidInDarkness> @soulkarl Also you're right in a way, but Graverobber fits in a nice niche for mobile damage setups. 2 GR, a Flag and 1 other works just fine
[3:08:11] <%GingaNZ> thanks for making that song DMX
[3:08:12] <Ariksgabs> Literature is the strongest weapon
[3:08:13] <ccrida> BUTTERFLY IN THE SKY MY DAMAGE CAN TWICE AS HIGH
[3:08:16] <%TRILLTURBAN> THINGS TO KNOW, PLACES TO GO
[3:08:18] <alexandrecau> even the body read
[3:08:21] <+MetalMeltdown31> I don't remember the part of Reading Rainbow where you get shot.
[3:08:22] <Stofil42> i guess graverobber is okay for hunting the shuffling monster
[3:08:28] <Tampaoster> USE UP THE BANDAGES
[3:08:29] <%SWFanatic> i fucking love coloring
[3:08:31] <GMN1> LUL
[3:08:31] <sosuke5> Not even using the antivenoms...
[3:08:31] <+IronPickle> It's in a book. Read a a book. Don't burn a book. Reading Rainbow
[3:08:33] <joylent_blue> no you don't get to enjoy your win
[3:08:34] <Tampaoster> AND VENOM ANTIDOTE
[3:08:35] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> throw the food away
[3:08:37] <%DashXero> "it says my very existence is an abomination. I don't think I like this book."
[3:08:37] <soulkarl> is the argument about not having the shieldbreaker dlc?
[3:08:39] <FrustratedAF> oh i wish i was lavar burton. where's my iconic slave role?!
[3:08:40] <+jorgamund> @MetalMeltdown31 it was in outtakes
[3:08:42] <%QueequegTheater> LeVar Burton couldn't handle these doots
[3:08:42] <simulationbard> Use wood to free up a slot
[3:08:43] <soulkarl> like ill bite if that's not being factored in
[3:08:45] <%LethargicRush> Beware, Reading rainbow is a slow and insidious way for a good time
[3:08:45] <Tampaoster> BANDAGES
[3:08:51] <%CEGold> @MetalMeltdown31 That's because you got shot woolieF woolieU woolieS woolieT
[3:08:51] <Tampaoster> bandages
[3:08:54] <soulkarl> w/o shieldbreaker i can see a lot more use for her
[3:08:57] <gunstar73> Drop herbs
[3:09:01] <eldragon_1> Don't force them to read Naruto BibleThump
[3:09:03] <+paladinstarbuster> Shovel
[3:09:04] <%LethargicRush> dont nap
[3:09:06] <DynemaUmbra> @WoolieVersus for future reference, stunning the protectors will cancel out their guard, hope this helps if you didnt know
[3:09:07] <%QueequegTheater> NO GET FOOD FIRST
[3:09:10] <%LethargicRush> its a baaad idea

[3:09:32] <gunstar73> Lol
[3:09:34] <LucidInDarkness> @soulkarl I don't have the dlc but even then, GR still has a small use. Not enough to pick her over Sheildbreaker, but if you have one, she can do good work.
[3:09:36] <%QueequegTheater> 24 FOOD IS TOO MUCH I GUESS
[3:09:38] <misterbarkley> oof
[3:09:46] <beigesamurai> Ditch the shovel, there are no obstacles on the map
[3:09:48] <ccrida> "24 food is too much" -Woolie 2019
[3:09:49] <%Doodle_Taco> Yo does someone remember Joland, he was hype
[3:09:51] <+manwithboxonhead> Famine time

[3:09:59] <eddiemayfly> Inb4 Night Ambush. Although he has the Highway boy and the Graveborer.
[3:10:03] <gunstar73> To much food woolie says
[3:10:06] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> food is never enough
[3:10:06] <LucidInDarkness> @soulkarl Shieldbreaker (after her nightmares) is overall a better GR
[3:10:11] <gryffinp> Definitely gotta bring extra food when you're dealing with extra consumption debuffs, which you are
[3:10:13] <dukenux> H u n g e r y
[3:10:14] <DynemaUmbra> ah my bad then, sorry for backseating
[3:10:14] <CopperTucker> always buy more food than you need. Always.

[3:10:18] <%SWFanatic> food is life
[3:10:19] <%QueequegTheater> Fair enough
[3:10:19] <NinjaGentleman> im back has he made it to the darkest dungeon yet?
[3:10:23] <%GingaNZ> Not much food in the ruins particularly @WoolieVersus
[3:10:24] <LucidInDarkness> I agree
[3:10:25] <joylent_blue> Joland was my Leper, he went to the final boss, he was cool
[3:10:26] <sosuke5> WE KNEW IT WOULD HAPPEN, WE SAID SO
[3:10:27] <soulkarl> and then also that BH is in the same boat
[3:10:28] <%king_wragles> @WoolieVersus Eat the gold!
[3:10:31] <gunstar73> But has 6 antivenoms
[3:10:31] <%wolfofsound> twitch chat is all about hindsight
[3:10:33] <%LethargicRush> well you can do the skills which is good
[3:10:33] <adjothetiger> @WoolieVersus i'm glad i showed up i picked up this game after watching you play this on youtube
[3:10:37] <Stofil42> its the warrens that let you go in with less food
[3:10:41] <%QueequegTheater> Gallows
[3:10:44] <SaltyBrim> Don’t need to roll when you have enough food Kappa
[3:10:44] <simulationbard> Leper lore is my favorite from a character stand point
[3:10:46] <%LethargicRush> also dont do anything with velstal cause it propably isnt gonna work
[3:10:50] <Iam_Dead> I always go 12 12. The extra food helps when you're heal rolls are shit like mine.
[3:10:53] <+OceanGovernor> You could just bring enough food rather than gamble on it
[3:10:53] <%CEGold> Is..is it time to cannabalize? woolieVERGIN
[3:10:56] <grayjammer> @woolieversus you should have had perfect RN
[3:10:57] <LucidInDarkness> @soulkarl Yeah pretty much. Someone is always at the bottom LUL
[3:10:57] <%LethargicRush> YES
[3:10:59] <Mr_Strut> VIGIL
[3:11:02] <%LethargicRush> prevent ambush
[3:11:02] <grayjammer> *RNG
[3:11:12] <alwayspronking> If afflicted, prevents ambush?
[3:11:17] <soulkarl> i actually think her REAL niche is with the acc rebalance
[3:11:19] <FrustratedAF> BlessRNG for good heals
[3:11:19] <%QueequegTheater> @LucidInDarkness ANd it's always Antiquarian
[3:11:20] <misterbarkley> *sad voice: tarkus, tarkus, tarkus
[3:11:22] <%Doodle_Taco> The leper is the most badass character in this game without a doubt
[3:11:26] <simulationbard> Everyone has mortality debuffs
[3:11:26] <soulkarl> using the throwing dagger for the self acc buff
[3:11:33] <+MetalMeltdown31> Doesn't everyone have a mortality debuff?
[3:11:34] <%QueequegTheater> do iT
[3:11:35] <%LethargicRush> also it may not work
[3:11:38] <Stofil42> no woolie everyone has the debuff
[3:11:39] <soulkarl> cuz man in top difficulty shit is acc a big issue again all of a sudden
[3:11:39] <%QueequegTheater> DO IT
[3:11:51] <+paladinstarbuster> My Sanctuary
[3:11:52] <LucidInDarkness> @QueequegTheater Now I disagree there. Risposte setups are great throughout the game and Antiq is great for those
[3:11:53] <thepardack> Grey skull are mortality debuffs
[3:11:56] <%LethargicRush> i got a really bad feeling woolie is gonna get ambushed....
[3:11:58] <%LethargicRush> i dont know why
[3:12:08] <%DashXero> Gotta use every trick in the book...

[3:32:35] <joylent_blue> penance hall is best
[3:32:38] <+DK_Rance> flagellation
[3:32:38] <%DashXero> Claustrophobia overwrote masochism.
[3:32:49] <%DashXero> Oh Wait. No it didn't.
[3:32:54] <simulationbard> Penance hall for big stress heals
[3:33:15] <%QueequegTheater> @DashXero Stress afflictions are separate from Quirls
[3:33:16] <%SWFanatic> in the wiki
[3:33:22] <djbrooks603> He lost it due to claustrophobia
[3:33:24] <%SWFanatic> theres no tooltip for it ingame
[3:33:24] <%QueequegTheater> There is none
[3:33:25] <joylent_blue> i don't think it shows in game
[3:33:26] <%king_wragles> Checking the Wiki
[3:33:27] <simulationbard> Hover stats I think
[3:33:29] <NumbusPlays> I don't think it tells you exactly what it is
[3:33:29] <matrignomy7> Masochism was overwritten by claustrophobia.
[3:33:33] <KTDelgado> let him whip
[3:33:50] <joylent_blue> DO YOU? LUL after that?
[3:33:50] <matrignomy7> I think? I'm probably wrong.
[3:33:59] <Bimbort> I never gave it a chance past a few horrible losses right after launch, I should re visit it
[3:34:09] <%king_wragles> @WoolieVersus found the wiki entry
[3:34:12] <gryffinp> What's a "Neer"
[3:34:17] <%king_wragles> Afflicted heroes will suffer severe stat penalties, and have a chance to be able to act on their own at the start of their turn.
[3:34:17] <caribbean_samurai> He should get the Shindol character mods LUL
[3:34:24] <TheEnablerr> Nier? Pfffft keep doing this

[3:34:28] <+paladinstarbuster> Nier sucks anyway More DD
[3:34:28] <simulationbard> @matrignomy7 No masochism is an affliction not a quirk. Claustrophobia wouldn't over write it
[3:34:33] <KTDelgado> OOF @caribbean_samurai
[3:34:35] <gryffinp> Tablelords D&D 3.5
[3:34:36] <+WhyIDie> 3.5 edition or no edition

[3:35:28] <LucidInDarkness> Can't fuck uo once in this stream LUL
[3:35:31] <dragoon001914> Dark Heresy is neat but maybe the second edition since the first edition is really basic compared to the later FFG Warhammer games.

[3:44:09] <%wolfofsound> @dudecool61 I'd like to see him play mouseguard
[3:44:09] <Pointdot> Leper hates Abom so he's pretty garb in my book

[4:02:17] <@mothmandraws> head seems to give more stress
[4:02:18] <%allouttajuice> 7 is a lucky number though, 25 isn't
[4:02:21] <Sphincter_Spelunker> "Known cheat" Well, yeah. Look at that easy-access fuck robe
[4:02:25] <@mothmandraws> might have been what pushed healer to edge last run
[4:02:33] <%QueequegTheater> @mothmandraws It is absolutely worth it though
[4:02:37] <@mothmandraws> it is
[4:02:39] <@mothmandraws> just worth noting
[4:02:51] <%QueequegTheater> Nobody died, it's fiiiine
[4:03:16] <simulationbard> He's got a Jester stress management should be better this run
[4:03:17] <@mothmandraws> its the "fuck off cthulhu" incense
[4:03:20] <+vdalson> yeah hit the back
[4:03:21] <+Zaramoth> first time seeing woolie live, has he lost a chunk of weight or does he just seem thiccer on youtube for some reason?
[4:03:31] <Sphincter_Spelunker> both

[4:06:06] <+WhyIDie> ja rule with that slowdraw and flawed release, sounds about right

[4:07:13] <aeonicvector> @JeedyJay Your proof my prank worked
[4:07:17] <JanusII> Watching Woolie waiting on my pizza so same.
[4:07:20] <aeonicvector> i wanted to see if people think he died
[4:07:41] <Parapattern> I want Woolie to become unbearably obnoxious in his shilling of Red Bull
[4:07:44] <JeedyJay> @aeonicvector Okay.

[4:09:19] <DevilBring3r> LETS GO
[4:09:20] <simulationbard> It's a fine team
[4:09:22] <cayvalentine> a bit too much movement for a leper
[4:09:22] <+dudecool61> We spent 30 minutes naming them I want to see blood
[4:09:22] <Sphincter_Spelunker> I thought this was a waste time run anyhow
[4:09:25] <+WhyIDie> bad teams are the best to watch though
[4:09:26] <%QueequegTheater> Woolie, you need to focus on a specific aspect instead of trying to cover everything
[4:09:26] <Finchit> yeah just do it its fine
[4:09:28] <LucidInDarkness> Oh...yeah. it doesn't look great
[4:09:29] <Mortal_Wombat_I> I’ve seen Lepers carry a team like crazy, it could work
[4:09:30] <%GingaNZ> leper in a team of movers is dodgy
[4:09:31] <%Cavumentum> Wait are we fighting fish or the weald
[4:09:32] <lizard0tm> I would replace grave robber with Hellion
[4:09:34] <Superblooms> Oh Snap! Darkest Dungeon!
[4:09:34] <+Zaramoth> worst bet everyone dies, no big deal
[4:09:36] <$SilverRoddo> What could happen?
[4:09:37] <ducethegamer> actually fine
[4:09:40] <%QueequegTheater> Make a blight team or a bleed team, or stunners
[4:09:42] <negativejam> woolie sending a bootleg party with good gear to die LUL
[4:09:43] <AggsMK7> LP funzies

[4:10:00] <%king_wragles> "constructive criticism only".... then proceeds to not actually provide the constructive part....
[4:10:02] <+ZalgoTheWickedGod> Could just Deus vult it.
[4:10:02] <%Piemen99> One for him, let him have this
[4:10:11] <dukenux> People want to see Dogeyes die
[4:10:12] <cayvalentine> If you cut out the grave robber and the jester and just stuck an arbelist where the jester is and a bounty wehere the robber is you got a pretty healthy mark team.
[4:10:13] <+aversal_ammar> I want you to succeed
[4:10:20] <%QueequegTheater> Lucatiel is safe in the hospital, idgaf
[4:10:20] <Raldavar> really want to pair the occultist with someone that can at least get other people off of death's door like the antiquarian or plague doctor
[4:10:21] <negativejam> twitch failures oft make good entertainment for the ailing chat minds
[4:10:22] <gunstar73> Twitch funsies into death is a true combo fedLUL
[4:10:23] <simulationbard> As long as Leaper hits things
[4:10:28] <$SilverRoddo> Relax, pretend it's a game, maybe it'll even be fun?
[4:10:29] <Raldavar> so healing isn't the occultist's thing
[4:10:37] <Superblooms> Mods!
[4:10:42] <Daxalog> You got that in reverese. One person go down. Everyone else go up
[4:10:51] <+WhyIDie> if they survive this run, think of the lore you'll build up for that team
[4:10:53] <%SeriousMrBlack> MOOKbong
[4:10:56] <Mr_Strut> Tiger's eye is great

[4:11:32] <+SpamKingRathalos> Deus Vult
[4:11:54] <Mr_Strut> Well there's your problem right there
[4:11:58] <LucidInDarkness> ^
[4:12:00] <Raldavar> the best defense is a good alpha strike
[4:12:04] <AggsMK7> Gotta be offensive. So offensive twitch bans you.
[4:12:05] <Daxalog> Thats a huge problem
[4:12:06] <%QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus That is actively hurting your teams
[4:12:13] <+SpamKingRathalos> Big alpha strike
[4:12:17] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Temporary buffs, huh
[4:12:20] <Mr_Strut> More hits and more crits will lower stress over time, and prevent incoming damage and stress
[4:12:26] <+paladinstarbuster> big turtle
[4:12:28] <%QueequegTheater> If you have enough stress to need stress heals, you're not ready to fight the boss
[4:12:33] <Daxalog> Healing during camp aint shit to just having bonus stats.
[4:12:33] <abowlofapplejacks> wont have stress if you obliterate your enemies in a round
[4:12:33] <LucidInDarkness> Camp buffs are the best map clearing @WoolieVersus You are actually hurting your runs
[4:12:34] <%wolfofsound> that's a paddlin'
[4:12:35] <+paladinstarbuster> or get there faster
[4:12:37] <MESeele> cross the lake before it sinks
[4:12:37] <AggsMK7> Dead monsters don't deal damage
[4:12:39] <Mr_Strut> The best defense is a good offence, especially in this game
[4:12:41] <%Doodle_Taco> No, be the hole
[4:12:46] <+skylerpilot> things cant hurt or stress you if they are dead @woolieversus !
[4:12:48] <%Piemen99> you don't have mockery on
[4:12:48] <simulationbard> The less time the enemies have to do things the less you need to turtle
[4:12:48] <AlasterAngelo> i don't understand the analogy
[4:12:50] <Parapattern> @WoolieVersus Remember to get somethin to eat Woolz!
[4:12:55] <+TonberryCrunch> But you will be less stressed overall if you kill the boss faster 🙃
[4:12:56] <ducethegamer> buffs are the biggest defense
[4:12:58] <Daxalog> Cross the lake before it sinks.
[4:13:01] <caribbean_samurai> be the hole Kappa
[4:13:08] <negativejam> woolie, try it, let's gunjunp and see how deep we can go Jebaited
[4:13:14] <+paladinstarbuster> FACTS
[4:13:15] <+WhyIDie> this isn't a pat stream, not here for the min/max
[4:13:16] <aeonicvector> best defense is a good offense usually
[4:13:17] <negativejam> BIG RISK BIG REWARD
[4:13:19] <%QueequegTheater> You do you, WOolie.
[4:13:21] <Pointdot> It's heal what you've accumulated versus prevent more from accumulating I guess
[4:13:22] <gunstar73> Camp buffs are actually broken
[4:13:22] <Sphincter_Spelunker> apatWrong
[4:13:22] <+SpamKingRathalos> All you need is kill.
[4:13:22] <Finchit> @WoolieVersus its all good just do it brah
[4:13:25] <AthenOwl> fuck the chat man, just play the way you want to do it
[4:13:25] <abowlofapplejacks> yes woolie you are wrong
[4:13:27] <+Zaramoth> "things cant stress you if they are dead" Not usually a lesson to take away with you but okay
[4:13:28] <+aversal_ammar> I never gave a fuck about team comps and I’ve beaten the game
[4:13:28] <%Cavumentum> Don't need to plug a hole in a stronger hull
[4:13:28] <Mr_Strut> Turtle build does not hold up well in darkest dungeon
[4:13:33] <+TonberryCrunch> it's not wrong, it's just a style
[4:13:36] <Raldavar> you can't out-heal damage taken...unless you end the source of damage swiftly
[4:13:37] <cayvalentine> I would say depends on the team, I would take buffs with an aggressive team
[4:13:38] <%aishman> Wait how did Woolie play it wrong?
[4:13:38] <abowlofapplejacks> we big right
[4:13:42] <+BBnumber9> Hi @WoolieVersus and chat! how you all doing today?
[4:13:43] <%QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus I really didn't mean to be rude about it, I apologize.
[4:13:44] <$SilverRoddo> But what about the return home, if the hole in the boat would still be a problem?
[4:13:45] <%DashXero> Please stop listening to chat so much, Woolie.
[4:13:46] <+paladinstarbuster> welcome to the new world of more violence 3
[4:13:48] <%king_wragles> I mean, there's no wrong way.... but the way you've been going doesn't seem effective
[4:13:51] <$Superdandy96> Eh, just do you Woolie. If we get hype moments, then that’s okay to me.
[4:13:57] <PlumpPotatoRump> @bbnumber9 'ello o//
[4:13:58] <cayvalentine> which is 90% of teams but still
[4:13:58] <dukenux> He didn't play it that exact way it should be played, that's how Kappa
[4:13:58] <+Tearonex> @WoolieVersus Not wrong, just too safe
[4:14:02] <ducethegamer> no one does
[4:14:03] <Parapattern> Everyone always plays it wrong according to everyone else
[4:14:09] <%Doodle_Taco> MITSURU IS TYPING...
[4:14:14] <Iam_Dead> Man, Fuck sukukaja
[4:14:18] <AlasterAngelo> buffs in Persona are the only way to play though
[4:14:22] <Yeajow> You're not on like the hardest its fine
[4:14:22] <+TonberryCrunch> tbf ailments fuckin suck cuz they never work on bosses anyway
[4:14:23] <aeonicvector> well yeah, cause buffs and debuffs are great in persona, and status is garbage there
[4:14:23] <caribbean_samurai> @doodle_taco LUL
[4:14:29] <%SilvaChariot0133> Mitsuru Help me I'm Dying
[4:14:30] <sirrice77> But persona is about buffs and debuffs
[4:14:31] <Raldavar> if anything stuns are an excellent source of defense and damage
[4:14:39] <+paladinstarbuster> I see why him and Pat are such great friends LUL
[4:14:39] <Raldavar> stuns are like a free turn
[4:14:43] <LucidInDarkness> @WoolieVersus It's less you're playing wrong, you're just playing too honest. You need the buffs to cheat
[4:14:48] <+TonberryCrunch> buffs and debuffs end up mandatory tho. ailments nah
[4:14:49] <+SpamKingRathalos> Stun machine Crusader
[4:14:55] <LucidInDarkness> You actually need to cheat in this game
[4:14:55] <Mortal_Wombat_I> I always go heavy on explosives in XCOM because they’re guaranteed damage, but I have buddies that tell me to NEVER use explosives. There’s just different ways to play I guess
[4:15:00] <+WhyIDie> longer drawn out fights gives more potential for funny moments
[4:15:02] <+conqab> I always kept myself buffed in persona boss fights
[4:15:11] <$SilverRoddo> Stun locks are great, use the stun animation against the enemies to your advantage.
[4:15:14] <Finakala> Persona bosses practically require at least some buffing
[4:15:16] <+SpamKingRathalos> The only way to deal with a xenos is to blow it up.
[4:15:18] <%DashXero> Woolie, you do you.
[4:15:27] <%DashXero> if you're comfortable with what you're doing, do it.
[4:15:31] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> I just came in to see Mothman 2
[4:15:33] <%Doodle_Taco> Reminder that the demi-fiend approves of buffs
[4:15:35] <%wolfofsound> if any team would cheat this one would
[4:15:35] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> what happened to Mothman 1?
[4:15:41] <@mothmandraws> he is mothman 1
[4:15:42] <%GarbageNirvana> aptBig cheats
[4:15:47] <LucidInDarkness> @WoolieVersus Then go for it dude. We're here to watch you be you

[4:15:54] <AlasterAngelo> "I really need some extra stress"
[4:15:58] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> @mothmandraws then why he got the 2
[4:16:00] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Mothman 2 is his own grandpa
[4:16:00] <aeonicvector> @Doctor_Death_Bed i got to name him, named him 2 to prank people into thinking he died
[4:16:04] <@mothmandraws> cause hes mothman 2
[4:16:14] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> oh how i have been fooled

[4:16:21] <+SpamKingRathalos> erbs
[4:16:21] <cayvalentine> I beat this game with a failry defensive mindset but I used stuns and gaurds all the time. Man at arms, arbelists, bounty hunters.
[4:16:22] <abowlofapplejacks> Play to the best of your team composition, some are meant for turtlin. some for being a glass cannon
[4:16:25] <%king_wragles> PUMP LUCK

[4:16:31] <AlasterAngelo> OH HE HUNGRY
[4:16:32] <Ids560> shovels can be used on a couple things in the weald
[4:16:39] <$SilverRoddo> Powerful Yugioh cards are designed to bend the game's rules. So, use them buffs. Big food.
[4:16:41] <%Piemen99> make that 4 shovels
[4:16:41] <%QueequegTheater> More shovels
[4:16:42] <+SpamKingRathalos> nobody is gonna starve on this run
[4:16:44] <Pointdot> A big reason I liked this game was that there's a lot of fun in experimenting with tons of different combinations, turns out there's a lot of winning combo's
[4:16:47] <%Rezca> wait, where are we going again?
[4:16:50] <+WhyIDie> everyone just wants to see a meta that's been played out too many times
[4:16:52] <$Superdandy96> Maybe Shovel Knight can help us out? Kappa
[4:16:57] <%wolfofsound> @SilverRoddo pft it's all about the heart of the cards

[4:17:34] <Ids560> this is the weald
[4:17:37] <cayvalentine> I would say this, defensive strats are cool woolie and the way you play can work, but you got three very aggressive heroes on your roster and a debuffer

[4:24:57] <%Doodle_Taco> @trillturban You can't convince me he doesn't wear them when he goes to work

[4:25:38] <%CEGold> Recardless of what you say, I'm still a gamer
[4:25:40] <Mangahero18> Question. If you bought these T Shirts would you actually wear them or just buy them for ironic reasons.
[4:25:49] <JumboMan214> When are us artists going to rise up
[4:25:49] <%QueequegTheater> I would burn them

[4:25:54] <+SpamKingRathalos> Burn them
[4:25:54] <%king_wragles> no
[4:25:55] <+TonberryCrunch> Now with the glass ceiling shattered, the most oprressed group of all can rise up, GAMERS
[4:25:56] <%wolfofsound> only at home
[4:25:57] <Lukas_Ipsum> @loarfy short answer, no. long answer, noooooooooooooooooooo
[4:25:58] <LucidInDarkness> @pkmamsters Think you tagged the wrong person there, but I appreciate the info anyway
[4:25:59] <@mothmandraws> I would wear them to my wedding
[4:26:03] <gustavozxd> i would feel shame to wear them even ironically
[4:26:04] <dukenux> Why would i not wear for them ironic reasons, if i already bought one
[4:26:05] <%CEGold> @Mangahero18 I'm not brave enough to wear this in public LUL
[4:26:09] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I'd buy them to give away as gag gifts
[4:26:09] <+pkmamsters> Does Woolie have his own EDGGEEE shirt int he works?
[4:26:10] <+Dovakhin573> The xp shirt is a special kind of oof
[4:26:14] <@mothmandraws> ill have an open coffin funeral
[4:26:15] <%DashXero> @JumboMan214 Probably when it becomes more profitable to do so than remain in the status quo.
[4:26:18] <+pkmamsters> Sorry, Lucid
[4:26:18] <+SpamKingRathalos> I'd wear these for a robbery and thats stretching it
[4:26:18] <devilxtrigger> Is Vegeta even that twisted?
[4:26:19] <@mothmandraws> and request I wear these
[4:26:22] <Parapattern> I would force other people to wear them at my wedding
[4:26:25] <%QueequegTheater> @mothmandraws This is why it should be illegal for shitposters to marry
[4:26:25] <dukenux> I'd wear one for a funeral, cause they're sad
[4:26:26] <TheEnablerr> I would give them to someone out of spite as a Christmas gift
[4:26:26] <JumboMan214> @DashXero im pretty good, wbu
[4:26:27] <abowlofapplejacks> i think we've lost @mothmandraws

[4:27:09] <b1gboss007> so
[4:27:10] <%QueequegTheater> WOuldn't this shirt work with kratos?

[4:37:53] <Kiari13> i can't even hear any game volume, is there something i should be hearing?

[4:38:39] <Dingo_Eejit> Blast Proccessing?
[4:38:39] <%DashXero> @JumboMan214 Not bad. I'd suggest starting with a more geometric approach, then working towards making things subtle from there.
[4:38:46] <+pkmamsters> I have to bump my volume up halfway to only kinda hear woobie
[4:38:53] <+DK_Rance> thats great now
[4:38:54] <negativejam> okay that worked for the voice
[4:38:54] <Kiari13> @pkmamsters same
[4:38:57] <+WhyIDie> can hear you a lot better now SeemsGood
[4:39:01] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah, that helps a lot
[4:39:02] <%DashXero> @JumboMan214 Go too hard to start, then work on backing it down.
[4:39:03] <+Robopengy> Does Woolie use any mod character?
[4:39:08] <+DK_Rance> nah
[4:39:09] <+A_mere_shrubb> Put the Mic within your nasal cavity
[4:39:09] <eddiemayfly> No mods, fellas.
[4:39:10] <SunnyRmuffins> teaps are not gay
[4:39:17] <Sphincter_Spelunker> no big tiddie mods
[4:39:23] <cafeapathy> @A_mere_shrubb mic on uvula or riot
[4:39:30] <eddiemayfly> NO BIGG TIDD OMEN SEEKER
[4:39:32] <cafeapathy> vore the mic
[4:39:35] <negativejam> you know what this game needs? MORE ANIME MODS
[4:39:36] <simulationbard> Yes Herbs
[4:39:37] <mercado94> kill them all
[4:39:38] <JumboMan214> Thats been my approach so far @DashXero
[4:39:39] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> cures a debuff
[4:39:45] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> use the herb
[4:39:45] <Kiari13> it's extra bad on like pat or paige's streams can't hear anything they say live at like 70% volume
[4:39:48] <+SpamKingRathalos> Anime mods for this game are so fun
[4:39:58] <JanusII> I gave up on Twitch audio being right and just run an equalizer plugin.
[4:39:59] <simulationbard> Herbs purge negative quirks
[4:40:01] <Parapattern> Use that dank herb
[4:40:08] <%DashXero> @JumboMan214 Mind if I do a quick paintover?
[4:40:12] <+SpamKingRathalos> Nothing liking marching into the last dungeon with Guts leading the squad.
[4:40:21] <eddiemayfly> @WoolieVersus Medicinal Herbs = Cure Negative Quirks. Corals are so fucking ridiculous.
[4:40:33] <%wolfofsound> @Kiari13 for real? They are super loud for me
[4:40:36] <%someyounguy1> its the little seen icon for losing a negative quality. you almost never get it so its hard to recall
[4:40:40] <eddiemayfly> Oh nevermind you already did it.
[4:40:48] <Parapattern> Henti-cons
[4:40:49] <negativejam> did somebody order some bleed?
[4:40:50] <+SpamKingRathalos> slaughter em
[4:40:55] <Sphincter_Spelunker> You guys know that default Twitch audio slider is at halfway, yeah?
[4:40:55] <JumboMan214> @DashXero I dont mind though ill prolly go to sleep soon
[4:40:57] <@mothmandraws> dunno spam, following guts around tends to be a bad thing
[4:41:13] <+WhyIDie> my twitch audio was maxed too
[4:41:14] <@mothmandraws> guts survives, no garuntee you will
[4:41:14] <+SpamKingRathalos> lmao you right about that
[4:41:18] <%DashXero> @JumboMan214 Cool. I'll DM it to you.
[4:41:24] <%wolfofsound> @mothmandraws lately everyone is doing ok
[4:41:25] <%someyounguy1> maybe im blind or dumb, but did some good punch father gift me a sub?
[4:41:29] <cafeapathy> i see guts go into my town im steeling a horse and getting 100 miles away
[4:41:38] <cafeapathy> .........and then i still wont be safe
[4:41:48] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Great!
[4:41:50] <Shiranui24> wow nice
[4:41:58] <DevilBring3r> PogChamp
[4:41:59] <orenfel> Is this with the DLC?
[4:42:02] <eddiemayfly> 1Turn KO. First time I seen that.
[4:42:06] <Bennett_Fracture> just like lady maria eh woolie...
[4:42:06] <+SpamKingRathalos> Snail
[4:42:06] <eddiemayfly> Also, No DLC
[4:42:14] <eddiemayfly> Nor DLC nor mods.
[4:42:18] <simulationbard> @orenfel No, this is the base game
[4:42:36] <%SoGetOnTheBomb> The Crimson Court DLC is fuckin bonkers
[4:42:47] <+SpamKingRathalos> Crimson Curse is tough
[4:42:52] <Gutsandlove> yeah you do not
[4:42:53] <AggsMK7> CC will fuck you up, be careful
[4:42:55] <%QueequegTheater> Crimson Court is a huge difficulty increase though
[4:42:59] <orenfel> @WoolieVersus is this game Hard or Unfair?
[4:43:06] <simulationbard> CC is a bitch and a half to manage in a fresh game
[4:43:07] <eddiemayfly> @WoolieVersus You can and you should. Crimson Court is killer on a new save.
[4:43:08] <@mothmandraws> define unfair
[4:43:09] <abowlofapplejacks> @mothmandraws who'd win, guts or the black swordsman
[4:43:11] <%QueequegTheater> Color of Madness is a better choice
[4:43:13] <Gutsandlove> just download it and you can keep your save @WoolieVersus
[4:43:14] <+SpamKingRathalos> super unfair at times
[4:43:18] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Crimson Court is apparently a nightmare
[4:43:22] <+A_mere_shrubb> @orenfel in the same sense that XCOM is
[4:43:24] <negativejam> crimson court made me consider using anime mods and some buff items LUL
[4:43:24] <+SpamKingRathalos> You are expected to lose, all the fucking time
[4:43:25] <cafeapathy> when did we get casey jones anyway?
[4:43:26] <Zebroneath> You don't lose anything, although it will change the game dynamic you are used to.
[4:43:26] <Gutsandlove> for all DLCs
[4:43:27] <adjothetiger> @WoolieVersus i have the game and yes you keep everything the dlc just adds on
[4:43:29] <SharpFence998> I would say unfair but fun anyway
[4:43:31] <+JavaManJoJo> the checklist is super good for it too, you can pick and choose to opt in to certain parts of the DLC
[4:43:35] <cayvalentine> Crimson court is interesting and this game is unfair if your unwilling to learn or do the hard diffictulty its way more fair than new xcom
[4:43:40] <@mothmandraws> the game is about crisis management and making best out of unfair situation
[4:43:47] <simulationbard> Those damn misquotes won't leave you alone
[4:44:01] <%QueequegTheater> This game is about replacing character models with anime tiddies
[4:44:06] <cayvalentine> its "hard but bad things will happen"
[4:44:11] <+SpamKingRathalos> Yep, don't get attached to anyone, odds are they'll die a horrible death
[4:44:12] <HammerNNail> When loading a save you have the choice to activate mods and dlcs, the icon is to the right of the name of the save.
[4:44:13] <+A_mere_shrubb> Wait so Woolie dosen't know about.... THE THIRST
[4:44:16] <adjothetiger> @WoolieVersus you can turn the court on and off before loading a save
[4:44:17] <+SpamKingRathalos> like mauled to death by snails
[4:44:37] <%Doodle_Taco> Never hidden
[4:44:39] <%QueequegTheater> But Reynauld tho
[4:44:44] <gustavozxd> this game is the opposite of happy
[4:45:02] <+SpamKingRathalos> This game is for masochists only.
[4:45:08] <Bennett_Fracture> god damn...
[4:45:10] <simulationbard> DOES THIS CONTAIN THE BLOOD
[4:45:13] <Laironx3> Curiously attractive for a fishman
[4:45:13] <+paladinstarbuster> Ancestor way too hype
[4:45:17] <%SoGetOnTheBomb> Radiant mode is pretty chill
[4:45:18] <+jediwatchman11> This game has always interested me but I've never bought it. My friends and I use the battle music for our Tabletop sessions tho
[4:45:18] <+SpamKingRathalos> Did someone say blood?
[4:45:20] <+LogothX> game is fir
[4:45:21] <coffeeabomination> @woolieversus so you need not have to delete your save to get thr dlc added onto your game, its useful
[4:45:28] <+paladinstarbuster> uh oh
[4:45:30] <+LogothX> fir gamblors only
[4:45:42] <@mothmandraws> odly enough the game plays somewhat with similar attitude that competitive tabletop wargames are, of knowing RNG will fuck you but knowing how to manipulate it to limit RNG impact on you
[4:45:46] <eddiemayfly> Darkest Dungeon is not that terrible. You can always get out of a pickle with enough luck.
[4:45:56] <+DingusMcFadden> This dungeon's pretty dark, guys ScaredyCat
[4:46:02] <eddiemayfly> Enough luck and RNG mitigation.
[4:46:02] <+SpamKingRathalos> Lady luck hates me
[4:46:08] <buildingmyfitlife> yo woolz, youre lookin lean bro! still hittin the weights?
[4:46:17] <simulationbard> Yeah but it's bad luck that gets you there
[4:46:18] <%Doodle_Taco> @dingusmcfadden It can be darker tho
[4:46:18] <$GenesisKnight> big heals
[4:46:20] <%kshatriyahdraws> give these fish Salmonella
[4:46:26] <Raldavar> Those that leave things to chance find this game very unforgiving
[4:46:43] <+WhyIDie> never got invested into the game because I hate that RNG controls so much of the experience, but like watching it played
[4:46:46] <Sphincter_Spelunker> by inches Kreygasm
[4:46:48] <Parapattern> Good play, Woolie
[4:46:48] <DevilBring3r> Crit heal!
[4:46:51] <+millionstabz> @WoolieVersus POSTURE CHECK
[4:46:52] <orenfel> I like hard games but this game seems to be pre loaded with a pissed off RNG god
[4:46:54] <%Rezca> Crits, more crits
[4:46:56] <abowlofapplejacks> exactly, even if the odds are against you; as long as you prepare you can survive most encounters
[4:46:58] <simulationbard> Never count on RNG helping
[4:47:03] <+SpamKingRathalos> never
[4:47:08] <+Elky3> never big curtain call chariCRY
[4:47:13] <%QueequegTheater> YOUR SPINE WOOLIE
[4:47:15] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Stop slouching, Woolz

[4:47:39] <%kshatriyahdraws> YES
[4:47:43] <JanusII> Chat being Woolie's mom.
[4:47:47] <eddiemayfly> Chat worries about you.

[4:47:54] <+SpamKingRathalos> Mom mode activated
[4:47:55] <coeurlycue> dont give the chat this kind of power over your life lol
[4:47:58] <+LogothX> woolies ok, get in
[4:47:58] <%someyounguy1> this is how the posture possy is summoned
[4:47:59] <AggsMK7> Chat is backseat sitting
[4:48:00] <+WhyIDie> twitch switched from playing your game for you to diagnosing you LUL
[4:48:00] <eddiemayfly> Purely purious: did Wayne June's voice sound a bit odd at the start of CoM or was that just me?
[4:48:02] <Sphincter_Spelunker> sorry, mom :(
[4:48:03] <@mothmandraws> WOOLIE SIT UP STRIAGHT, DRINK YOUR WATER
[4:48:04] <+JacktheMan18> LuL
[4:48:05] <+Elky3> it looked pretty bad chariPEEK
[4:48:07] <+paladinstarbuster> stand up and stretch dont be pat
[4:48:08] <Zantetzuken> back at risk
[4:48:12] <Raldavar> get a higher platform for your mouse so you don't have to lean as much
[4:48:12] <+This_is_marco> Don't forget to breathe
[4:48:12] <+Arsimckhoi> get a smaller table to put your mouse on! carpel tunnel is real
[4:48:15] <foxenco> scoliosis is no joke man
[4:48:18] <%Gogogolem> Drink yer Vegetable and eat your milk.
[4:48:19] <+DingusMcFadden> I'm not used to seeing Woolie wearing so few layers
[4:48:20] <Shiranui24> I like food
[4:48:21] <+pkmamsters> Where is Punch Mom to make him fix his posture
[4:48:26] <Pointdot> Arm rest is simply on the wrong side
[4:48:28] <+DK_Rance> better to be over prepared than under
[4:48:30] <+doc_coyote> Posture Pals
[4:48:33] <AdmiralButtloaf> SiT UP STRAIGHT OR THE DEVIL WILL GET YOU!
[4:48:35] <%kshatriyahdraws> streches too
[4:48:42] <+SpamKingRathalos> Time to drop food
[4:48:44] <%wolfofsound> @AdmiralButtloaf LUL
[4:48:46] <Mr_Strut> Just camp now and buff yourself
[4:48:48] <gunstar73> We just don’t want back at risk woolie take it from me I fucked my back so bad I couldn’t do shit for a year and a half
[4:48:51] <+A_mere_shrubb> key
[4:48:54] <DevilBring3r> Good bye food
[4:48:56] <+DingusMcFadden> Food is for suckers. I feel bad for youm @Shiranui24
[4:49:01] <AggsMK7> You've already got most unlocks
[4:49:02] <%kshatriyahdraws> kinesiology major say adjust you posture
[4:49:10] <Raldavar> antivenom isn't needed here
[4:49:16] <%QueequegTheater> Go on keto
[4:49:17] <+SpamKingRathalos> We the hungry squad
[4:49:20] <+pkmamsters> drop your food. perfect.
[4:49:26] <simulationbard> Drop the antivenom
[4:49:26] <+WhyIDie> play hungry LUL
[4:49:28] <eddiemayfly> Truly a Woolie move, to ditch land before ditching lunch.
[4:49:32] <UnknownGerm> since most of your hamlet is completely finished, you don't need deeds & the like anymore anyways?
[4:49:45] <cordhine> Just succumb to the abyss. Living is for squares, anyway.
[4:49:48] <%QueequegTheater> That's not how that works, Woolie
[4:49:55] <+JavaManJoJo> drop your shield
[4:49:56] <%QueequegTheater> YES THERE IS
[4:50:06] <+LogothX> backtrack ing burts the soul
[4:50:07] <Valentinius_Anodyne> They get bored
[4:50:13] <eddiemayfly> @WoolieVersus There is one that negates stress from walking backwards.
[4:50:13] <@mothmandraws> im not allowed to gamble lol
[4:50:14] <%SoGetOnTheBomb> Walking backwards is different than backtracking
[4:50:15] <+manwithboxonhead> It is more retreating than retracing
[4:50:15] <+SpamKingRathalos> Walking backwards really hurts
[4:50:25] <+manwithboxonhead> That hurts moral
[4:50:27] <+Arsimckhoi> it's just them feeling lost... going in circles
[4:50:28] <%wolfofsound> LUL
[4:50:28] <+Verd_254> if anything backtracking should be less stressful, but sure.
[4:50:33] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> Walking backwards means literally walking backwards
[4:50:35] <+SpamKingRathalos> you wanna see? Walk backwards now
[4:50:36] <+Elky3> rooNom
[4:50:36] <%QueequegTheater> It's not a tooltip in the game, there is a perk that negates it for the character onyl
[4:50:38] <gunstar73> You ever walk backwards woolie it sucks
[4:50:40] <%QueequegTheater> *only
[4:50:42] <coeurlycue> gives you a chance to really consider how fucked your surroundings are
[4:50:50] <LucidInDarkness> @WoolieVersus i mean, would you want to keep walking into an Eldritch hellhole? IT kind of makes sense. Also, there is in fact a perk that negates backtracking stress
[4:50:52] <abowlofapplejacks> Walking bckwards vs returning to the same route
[4:50:52] <yficaptions> moonwalking negates the stress debuff
[4:50:55] <+ForteBlade> moving any direction adds stress
[4:50:57] <eddiemayfly> @WoolieVersus There is none. Walking back always causes stress.
[4:50:59] <simulationbard> Literally moveing your characters backwards
[4:51:02] <Mr_Strut> Backtracking causes stress by default
[4:51:04] <dukenux> Having to backtrack irl stresses me out, too
[4:51:04] <+Haarute> You're backtracking. It's not the same.
[4:51:05] <Pointdot> No there was some miscommunication here
[4:51:12] <Iam_Dead> @WoolieVersus Walking backwards != backtracking
[4:51:15] <+SpamKingRathalos> Big miscommunication
[4:51:17] <DevilBring3r> Try it now
[4:51:17] <lizard0tm> No, EVERY character takes stress walking through places they've been already, unless they have a quirk that says they don't
[4:51:17] <%BlitzChocula> @Verd_254 agreed. I always thought that backtracking would be akin to retreating which is outright recommended to the player at the start
[4:51:22] <Mortal_Wombat_I> I thought the idea was that you were getting stressed out just from being in those hellholes
[4:51:23] <gunstar73> Your backtracking woolie in a hell zone
[4:51:23] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> pressthe left arrow key
[4:51:24] <+paladinstarbuster> even walking backwards youre still in a dungeon
[4:51:26] <CopperTucker> physically walking backwards makes you take stress, not retracing your steps
[4:51:28] <+Arsimckhoi> it's a formula dependent on fear and movement and armor
[4:51:28] <%QueequegTheater> Yeah, it should be marked better but it's definitely a thing
[4:51:29] <simulationbard> Not backtracking, literally walking backwards
[4:51:41] <cayvalentine> yes walking backwards gives them stress
[4:51:41] <+SpamKingRathalos> wait wut?
[4:51:43] <%QueequegTheater> @simulationbard Actually its both
[4:51:44] <+WhyIDie> gonna assume the quirk to stop that is the ability to moonwalk
[4:51:46] <+DingusMcFadden> Queequeg and Ishmael are the original ship
[4:51:52] <+DingusMcFadden> ...on a ship
[4:51:56] <+SpamKingRathalos> Tentacles
[4:51:58] <mr_slaide> OMG it's the WOOLIE!!!
[4:51:59] <+JavaManJoJo> Is there something about it in the glossary?
[4:51:59] <+A_mere_shrubb> Difference between backtrack and walking backwards
[4:52:00] <%QueequegTheater> I didn't name my character for Moby Dick
[4:52:02] <cayvalentine> Bactracking over already explored areas slowly stresses the party
[4:52:02] <simulationbard> Guess i mis rember then
[4:52:08] <dragoon001914> There's quite a few mechanics that really promote just cycling through characters.
[4:52:12] <+paladinstarbuster> still booty inside
[4:52:21] <%QueequegTheater> I named it for A Series Of Unfortunate Events
[4:52:25] <+SvenHolgersson> heh dic
[4:52:32] <+DingusMcFadden> I'm just giving an interesting piece of historical fact, @QueequegTheater
[4:52:37] <+bumpynavel> any chance woolie will be picking up kingdom hearts again?
[4:52:38] <LucidInDarkness> You leanr by getting bodied Woolie @WoolieVersus It's how we all learn this game LUL
[4:52:39] <+SpamKingRathalos> This fight might get annoying real quick
[4:52:44] <%BlitzChocula> the fact that characters can get "too" strong to even want to go into a lower dungeon really forces ya to keep recruiting and building people.
[4:53:02] <+SpamKingRathalos> I hate that mechanic, I pay you, do what I say dammit
[4:53:05] <%QueequegTheater> @DingusMcFadden Caesar and being stabbed tho
[4:53:11] <%QueequegTheater> That's the true ship
[4:53:24] <eddiemayfly> This game is just pure Wiki ploughing, just like Warframe. Although I guess Warframe's Wiki ploughing sessions are more extensive.
[4:53:25] <LucidInDarkness> @SpamKingRathalos But you're paying them only to throw them away afterwards LUL
[4:53:38] <gunstar73> The legit become to good to do the baby dungeons unless theirs a special event
[4:53:41] <+DingusMcFadden> That was a gang-bang. Gross, dude
[4:53:42] <orenfel> What difficulty is this on?
[4:53:45] <+SpamKingRathalos> SHHH, do what I say dammit, I own you!
[4:53:47] <+JavaManJoJo> @QueequegTheater Yo I love asoue, did you see the netflix series? I have some problems with it here and there but it was pretty fun overall
[4:54:02] <%BlitzChocula> anyone else like doing yolo no torch runs?
[4:54:04] <LucidInDarkness> @SpamKingRathalos They may as well make you struggle a bit for scarring them for life LUL
[4:54:06] <%QueequegTheater> Fernald and Sunny's interactions were downright amazing
[4:54:25] <+SpamKingRathalos> Yoinks
[4:54:38] <+DingusMcFadden> Gettin' pretty spoopy, ya'll
[4:54:45] <Raldavar> Woolie should really avoid blight and low health mobs. They don't live long enough for the damage over time to matter
[4:54:49] <+SpiceMastah> so dragon ball just finished running 4 majors in a day
[4:54:50] <%QueequegTheater> I thought NPH was pretty good, until that final episode holy shit he was phenomenal
[4:54:57] <+SpamKingRathalos> fill their veins with toxins
[4:55:10] <+razielhex> fish bros protestin' fish bros
[4:55:32] <Mangahero18> Hey Woolie? Did you see the new line of Persona 5 Funko Pops?
[4:55:50] <+SpamKingRathalos> c r i t
[4:55:54] <+JavaManJoJo> I didn't love some of the VFD changes, was maybe a bit too front and center. But it's cool that some fan theories were sort of confirmed
[4:55:56] <abowlofapplejacks> @Raldavar mobs he's going for are stress inducers who need to go the fastest
[4:55:57] <Zereaux> hey woolie ever want to fight artorias and sif in the same boss fight?
[4:56:02] <gunstar73> Those funkos are cursed
[4:56:22] <cayvalentine> Hell yeah
[4:56:25] <Raldavar> @abowlofapplejacks that's why he should go for damage moves like throwing knives/lunge instead of weaker ones
[4:56:30] <SeruraRenge> Careful Woolie, remember what they say about overconfidence
[4:56:39] <+SpamKingRathalos> its an insidious killer
[4:56:39] <Sebthemachinist> Poppin' in to offer salutations this man who almost has 1,000 VIEWERS RIGHT NOW HOT DAMN
[4:56:40] <cayvalentine> Knock those shields down with poison, they don't stand a chance
[4:56:50] <%QueequegTheater> Patrick Warburton was fucking PERFECT as Lemony and I won't hear a word otherwise
[4:56:51] <+SpiceMastah> bandai didn't think the tournament series through at all lmao
[4:56:57] <Geno4344> Woolie have you ever used ShindoL's character skins for this game?
[4:57:02] <eddiemayfly> High prot kills damage one way or the other. DoT is so much more reliable.
[4:57:02] <+FightingFenghuang> man this game i tried to play it but it stressed me out too hard
[4:57:02] <simulationbard> He was up over 1000 a bit ago
[4:57:04] <+SpamKingRathalos> Ja Rule gettin the works
[4:57:07] <Parapattern> The Occultist blows every other healer out of the water
[4:57:07] <+Haarute> Stacking blight here would be better I think.
[4:57:08] <eddiemayfly> @Geno4344 No mods.
[4:57:18] <$SilverRoddo> What if Funkos gave permanent Fallout buffs?
[4:57:19] <Geno4344> :(
[4:57:19] <+DingusMcFadden> No actor has properly captured Orlaf's menace, and I'm not even familiar with the series
[4:57:20] <DevilBring3r> NotLikeThis
[4:57:26] <+SpamKingRathalos> Vestal rocks better imo
[4:57:34] <+JavaManJoJo> @QueequegTheater I AGREE
[4:57:36] <+SpamKingRathalos> Because party heals are godly
[4:57:38] <+Arsimckhoi> alright somebody buy this guy some ergonomic desk mount thing for his mouse hand
[4:57:41] <HammerNNail> Vestal and Occultist have very different uses.
[4:57:44] <Mangahero18> @SilverRoddo Like in Real Life? Still wouldnt be worth it.
[4:57:51] <%QueequegTheater> @DingusMcFadden Carrey was closer but NPH captured his weirdo goofiness better
[4:57:57] <Raldavar> double occultists are very good
[4:57:59] <HammerNNail> Vestal is a healbot, Occultist is a healbot that also has some utility.
[4:58:01] <$SilverRoddo> bitterLOL
[4:58:02] <+DingusMcFadden> Neither were scary
[4:58:02] <+paladinstarbuster> dont heal bleed right away with occultist
[4:58:04] <+SpamKingRathalos> Don't need full health, just need em off of deaths door.
[4:58:07] <SeruraRenge> @SpamKingRathalos Basically every meta party setup uses the vestal
[4:58:11] <UnknownGerm> they have base 50% prot
[4:58:13] <abowlofapplejacks> throwing knives would be a better choice.
[4:58:15] <Shiranui24> big tank
[4:58:21] <Sebthemachinist> THOUSAND VIEWERS aeroCheer lytTHUMBSUP bo8FIST
[4:58:25] <Shiranui24> oof
[4:58:26] <mr_slaide> Big damage for big boy.
[4:58:34] <+SpamKingRathalos> @SeruraRenge pretty much and for good reason with some of those pesky bosses.
[4:58:34] <Shiranui24> blight them
[4:58:35] <UnknownGerm> also, finale got hella nerfed from the lasttime you played
[4:58:36] <DevilBring3r> Big dodge
[4:58:39] <+pkmamsters> I always enjoy seeing Kyrie trending on Twitter in the US.
[4:58:43] <%QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Remember, protection doesn't affect DoT numbers
[4:58:45] <LucidInDarkness> I gotta ask...at what point are we backseating vs casually dropping tips t Woolie?
[4:58:46] <%SoGetOnTheBomb> Should get pickaxe on Dogeyes, goes through prot I think
[4:59:04] <%QueequegTheater> I'm just gonna give tips, chat can do what it wants
[4:59:04] <eddiemayfly> Bulwarks are just "Drop blight res, then stack Blight 'till they drop".
[4:59:08] <ACriticalThink> Man, the DBFZ tourney chat was great.
[4:59:18] <SeruraRenge> @UnknownGerm Everything gets nerfed in this game eventually, because the dev can't stand it when people figure out how to break the game
[4:59:19] <CurrySauseBandit> @LucidInDarkness When you start yelling at him to use specific skills and strategies I guess.
[4:59:19] <+WhyIDie> @LucidInDarkness a hard thing to balance, probably depends on how many different people are giving tips at the same time
[4:59:22] <%QueequegTheater> Blight him forever
[4:59:22] <Vicviper909> yooooo!
[4:59:35] <+JavaManJoJo> He never *quite* felt evil enough, but that might have just been the different tone of the series compared to the books.I still thought NPH was good tho.
[4:59:36] <%QueequegTheater> YUP
[4:59:41] <%QueequegTheater> DROP YOUR SHIELD
[4:59:44] <+SpamKingRathalos> yeah, its a thin line between tips and backseating
[4:59:44] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Drop your shield
[4:59:49] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 5 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 20oz (600mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[4:59:49] <%SoGetOnTheBomb> Y'know what I mean
[4:59:50] <Pointdot> The question is though, what's the difference between tipping and back seating
[4:59:55] <The_Blumper> DROP YOUR SHEILD
[4:59:58] <LucidInDarkness> @CurrySauseBandit @WhyIDie Fair enough. I just don't wanna be that guy in chat, especially if what I say fucks Woolie up somehow
[5:00:03] <PaizuriBoss> WOOLIE
[5:00:05] <abowlofapplejacks> sentiment
[5:00:11] <PaizuriBoss> WE GOT JEBAITED AGAIN BY BANDAI
[5:00:14] <gunstar73> Woolie back at the beginning of ds2 aleksHa
[5:00:15] <+JavaManJoJo> maybe menacing or scary is a better word than evil
[5:00:16] <+SpamKingRathalos> 100% understand that
[5:00:20] <mr_slaide> Yop
[5:00:21] <+SpamKingRathalos> YEO
[5:00:21] <%QueequegTheater> You can use bandages without moving
[5:00:28] <+WhyIDie> the rule I usually follow is enjoy how they experience it without help, unless they specifically start asking for help
[5:00:29] <SeruraRenge> until they run out, yes
[5:00:33] <cayvalentine> Bandage them if yu need to
[5:00:33] <faegbeard> ye ye (ye)
[5:00:35] <+SpamKingRathalos> You about to bleed
[5:00:36] <gunstar73> Yes
[5:00:36] <DevilBring3r> Ye
[5:00:38] <+DingusMcFadden> This is the first time I've watched your stream @WoolieVersus, so I'm unfamiliar with your layout. Is that a small animal enclosure behind you to the left? Your left
[5:00:43] <cayvalentine> but otherwise ye eat that blood bro
[5:00:44] <Raldavar> Woolie hasn't figured out how to stall fights to heal yet
[5:00:47] <gunstar73> Honestly just take it
[5:00:53] <Shiranui24> eat the food
[5:00:55] <@mothmandraws> I gotta sleep, catch you later guys
[5:00:57] <Sphincter_Spelunker> lit
[5:01:00] <+SpamKingRathalos> @DingusMcFadden thats the Dio lair
[5:01:02] <+Arsimckhoi> like this https://www.ergoexpress.com/mousearm.aspx
[5:01:03] <Shiranui24> yeah light up
[5:01:05] <%QueequegTheater> Mods are asleep post memes
[5:01:09] <CurrySauseBandit> @LucidInDarkness Meh, he's a big boy. He'll be fine and the chat will try correcting advice as it comes. Don't worry about being "that guy" for a moment. Nobody will remmeebr that one offense anyway.
[5:01:10] <Pointdot> There's some beautiful animals in there
[5:01:10] <Tampaoster> blaze it
[5:01:11] <gunstar73> Not worth using bandages unless your in a boss fight
[5:01:12] <LucidInDarkness> @WhyIDie Good policy. Unfortunantely, not all streamers distinguish it like that
[5:01:12] <+DingusMcFadden> His left, our right
[5:01:12] <simulationbard> They heavlly nerfed stalling
[5:01:15] <+SpamKingRathalos> @mothmandraws Peace
[5:01:16] <orenfel> Anyone know what Difficulty this is on?
[5:01:22] <gunstar73> Gn moth aleksGn
[5:01:24] <+SpamKingRathalos> Normla I believe
[5:01:28] <Raldavar> you only need to stall for 3 turns
[5:01:30] <UnknownGerm> woolie
[5:01:34] <+DK_Rance> @orenfel normal
[5:01:36] <torontototoro> Hi Woolie! Love your recent solo work and podcast stuff. <3
[5:01:36] <UnknownGerm> it's right in front of you
[5:01:39] <%kshatriyahdraws> bye moth
[5:01:40] <%QueequegTheater> @orenfel Medium I think
[5:01:40] <+SpamKingRathalos> DONE
[5:01:41] <CurrySauseBandit> By the way, who said not to blight low health enemies?
[5:01:42] <abowlofapplejacks> Moth2 will watch over us
[5:01:42] <orenfel> Ah cool, thanks
[5:01:43] <+Haarute> Hey now.
[5:01:44] <simulationbard> I think he's on darkest
[5:01:47] <Laironx3> Yaaaas... coigne
[5:01:48] <cayvalentine> Hey now
[5:01:52] <+SpamKingRathalos> Time to Drop food
[5:01:54] <%QueequegTheater> YEYEYEYE
[5:01:57] <matrignomy7> REVERSE CRAZY TALK
[5:01:58] <Sphincter_Spelunker> gtfo
[5:01:59] <ThePuddingDead> oooOoOOoooo How's he doing?
[5:02:01] <DevilBring3r> Drop the food
[5:02:08] <%BlitzChocula> Crazy Talk Requiem.
[5:02:09] <matrignomy7> Maybe?
[5:02:10] <+TallguyZin> Me Vs. Woolie? That would last like... 5 seconds.
[5:02:21] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> Should have rested first?
[5:02:22] <UnknownGerm> I would have camped for free stress heals
[5:02:22] <abowlofapplejacks> well done
[5:02:29] <+SpamKingRathalos> S Rank
[5:02:31] <Shiranui24> aww i wanted to see someone go crazy
[5:02:34] <eddiemayfly> Stalling, currently, is a tad unless you're running modded classes that can drop stun res or an overall Stun buffing mod.
[5:02:36] <%QueequegTheater> SHould've rested for free stress heal
[5:02:37] <ThePuddingDead> Is he playing on pc?
[5:02:39] <+DingusMcFadden> Pretty confident, huh @TallguyZin ?
[5:02:40] <LucidInDarkness> @CurrySauseBandit Eh fair enough
[5:02:42] <yficaptions> But we didn't kill aqua man
[5:02:52] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> not a big deal, but yeah
[5:02:55] <SeruraRenge> I think my only complaint with this game is once you actually have down how you're supposed to play, you can basically play the game on autopilot without fear
[5:02:56] <EatMyBeeper> the woolie hole wins again
[5:03:02] <+TallguyZin> @DingusMcFadden No I mean he would kick my ass in 5 seconds.
[5:03:14] <%QueequegTheater> USE IT ON A MAX LEVEL CHAR
[5:03:14] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Why'd you make Woolie buy all that food, guys Kappa
[5:03:17] <abowlofapplejacks> nice
[5:03:23] <+SpamKingRathalos> sweet
[5:03:24] <LucidInDarkness> @SeruraRenge Well, the game can still fuck you over. But if you're used to it, you can turn it around pretty easily
[5:03:31] <+WhyIDie> expired food is tastier Kappa
[5:03:34] <$SilverRoddo> Eric carried this team into victory!
[5:03:40] <gunstar73> Use a max boi because their shit is expensive
[5:03:46] <SeruraRenge> @LucidInDarkness There are some team setups that are nigh-immune to rng fuckery
[5:03:47] <+SpamKingRathalos> Pretty much, knowing whats coming helps in this game
[5:03:54] <+DK_Rance> @WhyIDie god i still remember those woolie days lol
[5:04:00] <%QueequegTheater> Lucatiel and Bastila need to bang some hooers
[5:04:08] <+SpamKingRathalos> Has the VVulf encounter already happened?
[5:04:10] <+DingusMcFadden> Yer into masochism, @TallguyZin?
[5:04:21] <LucidInDarkness> @SeruraRenge Well, shuffle rng anyway. Crits can still happen, unless you're talking about a specific setup I've yet to use myslef
[5:04:21] <simulationbard> Yeah he's got the trinket
[5:04:30] <+supaXmugen> This GAME is masochism
[5:04:32] <+SpamKingRathalos> ahh thanks
[5:04:33] <+WhyIDie> @DK_Rance gotta keep that kayfabe alive
[5:04:41] <%QueequegTheater> SEND EM TO THE HOOERHOUSE
[5:04:49] <+TallguyZin> @DingusMcFadden No I'm just really bad at any video games
[5:04:49] <+SpamKingRathalos> Off guard
[5:04:50] <Raldavar> People are confusing 3 turn stalling on the last mob with endless stalling
[5:04:53] <ThePuddingDead> How far has Woolie gotten in D.D.?
[5:04:58] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> Looks like they need a nice stay at the fuck shack
[5:05:04] <+DingusMcFadden> Just go for the balls, @TallguyZin
[5:05:05] <+supaXmugen> How long ago was a woolie Slay the Spire stream? or did he never do one because he doesnt care for the game?
[5:05:09] <Raldavar> the trick is to kill the last guy before the third turn is over
[5:05:21] <%BlitzChocula> flagellation is whipping yerself, right?
[5:05:21] <+DingusMcFadden> CAUSE SHE'S A WOMAN
[5:05:26] <Raldavar> getting 2 stuns in 3 turns is a net gain in healing health/stress
[5:05:30] <abowlofapplejacks> yep
[5:05:31] <Raldavar> at the end of the fight
[5:05:32] <KTDelgado> meditation room
[5:05:33] <+SpamKingRathalos> nope
[5:05:35] <+DK_Rance> beer her up
[5:05:36] <%kshatriyahdraws> yes
[5:05:37] <simulationbard> @BlitzChocula Yes
[5:05:45] <LucidInDarkness> LUL
[5:05:45] <Intolerable> OH SHIT! I fucking love DD.
[5:05:46] <eddiemayfly> @WoolieVersus Don't reckon that will help Luca's stress.
[5:05:46] <+TallguyZin> @DingusMcFadden Sir! I am a man of honor and would never stoop to such a barbaric action
[5:05:47] <ThePuddingDead> nothin
[5:05:47] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> beer go UP
[5:05:48] <%QueequegTheater> I don't think it can get worse
[5:05:51] <%someyounguy1> put that girl in the meditation room. Theres agood chance she disappears
[5:05:52] <LucidInDarkness> Time will tell Woolie
[5:05:52] <+WhyIDie> only one way to find out LUL
[5:05:52] <CrimsonFox777> yes
[5:05:55] <+Haarute> Yes.
[5:05:56] <Deadpool2450> yaaaas woolie
[5:05:56] <+DingusMcFadden> Yes?
[5:05:57] <+A_mere_shrubb> @WoolieVersus They have a high chance of fucking off for a few days
[5:05:57] <+DK_Rance> beer her
[5:05:57] <DevilBring3r> yes
[5:05:57] <%QueequegTheater> Send her to the HOOERS
[5:05:58] <+SpamKingRathalos> Yes
[5:06:00] <ducethegamer> abosulty nothing
[5:06:01] <%SoGetOnTheBomb> Affirmative
[5:06:04] <+DingusMcFadden> Wait-NO!
[5:06:07] <+TallguyZin> Yes
[5:06:09] <oaknveil> hello <3
[5:06:09] <+supaXmugen> Give her Beer!
[5:06:10] <ThePuddingDead> it doesn't, it only affects alcohol found in dungeon
[5:06:11] <+LogothX> Yes ! I am
[5:06:13] <+SpamKingRathalos> Science time
[5:06:13] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> Do it you coward
[5:06:13] <simulationbard> It's a forced interaction quirk iirc
[5:06:16] <%QueequegTheater> WOOLIE NO
[5:06:18] <Mr_Strut> Doesn't affect the bar. That trait forces her to interact with alcohol curios
[5:06:21] <%QueequegTheater> GIVE HER WHORES
[5:06:28] <LucidInDarkness> Oh fuck forced interaction quirks
[5:06:33] <eddiemayfly> @WoolieVersus That quirk only affects Alcohol interactions on dungeons.
[5:06:34] <+TallguyZin> I think theres an increased chance of something bad happening.
[5:06:35] <+WhyIDie> just let it rock
[5:06:46] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> Let a lady drink
[5:06:46] <ThePuddingDead> u already paid for it so thats money wasted
[5:06:46] <LucidInDarkness> Let it rock LUL
[5:06:50] <+SpamKingRathalos> Forced interactions are super bad
[5:06:57] <%QueequegTheater> No, based on it being the highest stress reeduction
[5:07:04] <ducethegamer> no there is only isn't
[5:07:07] <KTDelgado> let her meditate so she thinks of her self
[5:07:14] <%QueequegTheater> Dipsomania only affects in-dungeon alcohol stuff
[5:07:14] <+supaXmugen> I thought Egomania was "ME ME ME!!"?
[5:07:21] <+SpamKingRathalos> No refund
[5:07:26] <eddiemayfly> @WoolieVersus None of the negative nor positive quirks affect the stress reduction from builsings unless yer on mods.
[5:07:29] <%QueequegTheater> Ehh, it's all good
[5:07:35] <ThePuddingDead> it deals with moments where she'll randomly not interact with curios, self worship stuff
[5:07:38] <%SoGetOnTheBomb> monkaS
[5:07:43] <%UrsulaCat> dork dungon
[5:07:47] <LucidInDarkness> @QueequegTheater Steer Woolie to victory. Or the Town cemetary, whichever happens first
[5:07:51] <+DingusMcFadden> I thought Egomania was a professional wrestling venue.
[5:07:51] <alexandrecau> last run most important run
[5:07:53] <Tampaoster> You would need a vestel
[5:07:54] <+SpamKingRathalos> Wait till she fucks with something and gets a disease.
[5:07:57] <ThePuddingDead> Ok so he's playing base D.D.
[5:08:02] <%QueequegTheater> I only steer Lucatiel to survival
[5:08:14] <+SpamKingRathalos> Wait
[5:08:17] <%QueequegTheater> I will burn this hamlet to the ground to protect her

[5:10:54] <+Haarute> AoE heals vs single target heals.
[5:10:54] <LucidInDarkness> Consistency @WoolieVersus
[5:10:56] <UnknownGerm> you NEED AoE heals
[5:11:01] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> People don't like occultist because they're racist
[5:11:02] <CopperTucker> @WoolieVersus Occultist will do the extra damage. Bring both.
[5:11:04] <Raldavar> That's not how average works Woolie
[5:11:05] <Tampaoster> AND DOES NOT BLEED
[5:11:05] <blightblues> group heal >>> single target
[5:11:07] <HammerNNail> People like Vestal can't dick you super hard, and she has a stun from position 4.
[5:11:09] <eddiemayfly> @WoolieVersus Vestal can offer you more consistency and Party-wide heals.
[5:11:11] <simulationbard> she can bring multiple people off deaths door at once
[5:11:17] <Parapattern> @WoolieVersus Do whatever your heart tells you
[5:11:18] <Tampaoster> do one more round
[5:11:19] <%QueequegTheater> NO this is a suicide run, don't waste her
[5:11:19] <SkeletonLiar_> You only need one HP to stay off deaths dopr
[5:11:19] <%SoGetOnTheBomb> Bastilla's kinda fucked
[5:11:20] <Tampaoster> boi
[5:11:23] <+SpamKingRathalos> Its more important to keep people off of deaths door, especially when you have multiple people on deaths door
[5:11:25] <+Zxtole> You don't need a Vestel for DD lol
[5:11:25] <+Majiinbooh> occultist is better against eldritch tho and so is better for dd
[5:11:28] <LucidInDarkness> LUL uh oh
[5:11:29] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> Just like the real Bastilla
[5:11:30] <RooplesPooples22> Be a man, go occultist
[5:11:30] <%king_wragles> @WoolieVersus I hear you, but fuck Bastilla tho
[5:11:34] <CopperTucker> @WoolieVersus Darkest Dungeon is ALL Eldritch, bring Vestal and Occultist
[5:11:34] <+SpamKingRathalos> You can try occultis
[5:11:35] <ducethegamer> fuck it all heals
[5:11:40] <Raldavar> Bring double Occultist
[5:11:41] <Nuvhok> do a low level mission, then try DD
[5:11:41] <ThePuddingDead> @WoolieVersus I'm just gonna sit back and watch, but yeah...stuns and poisons and stress relief
[5:11:43] <%QueequegTheater> Two healers is better than you think
[5:11:44] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> Go 4 crusaders you COWARD
[5:11:45] <simulationbard> I think I did this with an occultist first time
[5:11:50] <RooplesPooples22> Bring 3 occultists
[5:11:50] <ducethegamer> double vestal, double occultist
[5:11:50] <cayvalentine> occultist is a good third slotter
[5:11:51] <Tampaoster> prime party
[5:11:52] <Shiranui24> yeah
[5:11:52] <%SoGetOnTheBomb> Just bring 4 Jesters for sick jams
[5:11:52] <%Cavumentum> Double Antiquarians motherfucker
[5:11:57] <HammerNNail> Bring Occultist in your 2nd slot Woolie.
[5:11:58] <LucidInDarkness> Fair enough, it works out just fine with both
[5:11:58] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Occultist is anti-eldritch, Darkest is filled with Eldritch
[5:11:58] <eddiemayfly> You are going to NEED party wide heals in the Dankest Dankeon.
[5:12:01] <Shiranui24> nobody dies that way
[5:12:01] <Bustahhwulf> 4 lepers
[5:12:02] <$CrowbarFacelift> I always use Occultist in 3rd
[5:12:03] <LotS__> bring 4 occultists
[5:12:06] <Intolerable> Hold off on DD run. Wait until you're ready
[5:12:06] <CurrySauseBandit> Oh he's never gone occult/vest? Oh my.
[5:12:07] <simulationbard> you can shove occultist in second slot
[5:12:07] <Iam_Dead> All doggos
[5:12:11] <lizard0tm> Vestal, Occultist, Hellion, Crusader
[5:12:13] <+Zxtole> Take no healer no balls
[5:12:15] <Ropcord> 3 antiquarians and a dog
[5:12:16] <cayvalentine> leper/crusader is good
[5:12:22] <Bustahhwulf> self healers
[5:12:29] <Shiranui24> bring NO heals. fuck it
[5:12:30] <+SpamKingRathalos> To advance the week you can just send some random smuck to advance a week
[5:12:31] <Tampaoster> PREPARE YOURSELF BATMAN
[5:12:33] <RooplesPooples22> heal using food alone
[5:12:42] <RooplesPooples22> no healers
[5:12:43] <cayvalentine> if you drop the occultist taking a man at arms instead of the crusader for the blocks/stuns is alright
[5:12:43] <UnknownGerm> also worth noting: once a party goes to the darkest dungeon they will never go back
[5:12:49] <+aversal_ammar> To the cove!
[5:12:57] <eddiemayfly> Send a sucker in and force a week forward.
[5:12:59] <abowlofapplejacks> @Ropcord he could grab so much stuff
[5:13:00] <ThePuddingDead> @WoolieVersus do NOT bring anyone lower than 5
[5:13:03] <%QueequegTheater> NO
[5:13:03] <InkyDraconian> Hell nah
[5:13:05] <Intolerable> Your impatience will be your downfall...
[5:13:06] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> Doo it
[5:13:07] <+SpamKingRathalos> NO
[5:13:08] <DevilBring3r> Yes
[5:13:08] <simulationbard> NO
[5:13:09] <+aversal_ammar> NOOOOO
[5:13:10] <SharpFence998> do not bring lvl 4
[5:13:12] <Bustahhwulf> lv4 is too cowardly
[5:13:13] <%QueequegTheater> That is just a death sentence to your level 4
[5:13:16] <%SoGetOnTheBomb> Overconfidence something something
[5:13:16] <simulationbard> They will not make it
[5:13:16] <LucidInDarkness> NAH
[5:13:17] <Pointdot> Yell at him more chat
[5:13:20] <Valentinius_Anodyne> You can just solo with some jobber to advance the week and get Bastilla back
[5:13:20] <+aversal_ammar> You don’t have to do a DD run tonight
[5:13:22] <%Cavumentum> LVL 1s LVL 1s LVL 1s
[5:13:23] <+SpamKingRathalos> If you feel tired, don't do darkest dungeon yet
[5:13:24] <+paladinstarbuster> nope
[5:13:25] <+dudecool61> Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer...
[5:13:27] <%QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Send in your lowest levels for funsies
[5:13:31] <mr_slaide> You're going to die... Horribly. Level 5 improvements on armor and weapons are huge.
[5:13:32] <CopperTucker> @WoolieVersus Train, train train.
[5:13:33] <+timblenaut> i dont think it allows you to take underleveld iirc
[5:13:33] <$SilverRoddo> Use Dragoons and never not Jump?
[5:13:34] <+SpamKingRathalos> You need to be in tip top condition for that hellhole
[5:13:35] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> Remind yourself that overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer
[5:13:36] <+aversal_ammar> That’s fine
[5:13:37] <Shiranui24> nah go in there
[5:13:38] <NervousArmy> half cleric and half melee fighter build
[5:13:40] <cayvalentine> get your achievment only level 1s
[5:13:41] <abowlofapplejacks> @WoolieVersus Do you want to win or do you want to live
[5:13:45] <%QueequegTheater> They can totally handle it!
[5:13:49] <DevilBring3r> its fine just do it
[5:13:51] <LucidInDarkness> Well don't unless you want an achievement for 4 lvl 1's into the DD @WoolieVersus LUL
[5:13:52] <+WhyIDie> send in your baby chicks into that woodchipper
[5:13:56] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It'll be fine
[5:13:56] <Nuvhok> Do another mission first or To the slaughter it is
[5:13:56] <eddiemayfly> Jobbers attack
[5:14:03] <Dstructer> Kill them all Woolie!
[5:14:04] <cayvalentine> all lvl 1 gives the Lambs for the Slaughter cheevo
[5:14:07] <ThePuddingDead> @WoolieVersus If you need to get rid of any extra lvl 0's or 1's send them in, BAM instant 70 stress out the gate
[5:14:07] <cayvalentine> and its pretty funny to get
[5:14:18] <+SpamKingRathalos> Can you still send 1 person to a mission, quit it and that will advance the week?
[5:14:18] <Tampaoster> Do the last round to prep up for next dd
[5:14:20] <Shiranui24> do it
[5:14:20] <+paladinstarbuster> I LOVE that the lower level guys are like FUCK DAT SHIT
[5:14:23] <%DashXero> @JumboMan214 If you're still here, I sent you the DM with the quick paintover.
[5:14:46] <LucidInDarkness> LUL that name
[5:14:58] <ducethegamer> too spoopy for wools
[5:15:00] <%QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus @Tampaoster is right, consider doing a mission to prep for you taking on DD next time
[5:15:01] <+WhyIDie> resident evil doesn't strike me as a woolie game

[5:16:25] <NervousArmy> are you planning on doing a KH3 stream?
[5:16:27] <eddiemayfly> @WoolieVersus Consider that you can just send one sucker into the Dankest and then retreat on the first room to force the week to pass.

[5:16:31] <BakedPretzels> play arkham asylum you chunk
[5:16:33] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Woolie has surpassed your puny survival horror games
[5:16:34] <%kshatriyahdraws> I found the channel thru jojo and hajime no ippo lp
[5:16:36] <JanusII> It's nice having somebody not streaming that right now honestly.
[5:16:37] <+rdark_ksu> Woolie what is a food that makes you miss being a child?
[5:16:39] <All_Salt> Pat beat it twice yesterday

[5:16:46] <Pat212> @WoolieVersus unrelated: Have you ever played Tribes 2
[5:16:52] <%QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus I know that shooters aren't really your speed but I would love to see a stream of Spec Ops: The Line, IMO it's Nolan North's best performance ever
[5:16:54] <+gusdabus91> one day woolie will run out of things he's excited to play and he'll play RE2
[5:16:56] <Bustahhwulf> no advice go in blind kkenREE
[5:16:57] <LucidInDarkness> X Gon Give it to ya
[5:16:57] <+heehofrosty> What if Kirby had tank controls?
[5:16:59] <BakedPretzels> woolies house is a survival horror

[5:34:37] <%Cavumentum> UPGRADE HER STUFF
[5:34:39] <Mashn2> Pay him with company’s share instead
[5:34:44] <%QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus If you sell some trinkets you'll have the cash to max out Bastila, that job-killing bitch
[5:34:48] <Pointdot> Totally undead
[5:34:51] <%ThePuddingDead> not enough money to upgrade
[5:34:53] <%king_wragles> Hey, is Queequeg gone yet? I want his office chair.
[5:35:00] <%QueequegTheater> NO IT'S MY CHAIR
[5:35:01] <+SpamKingRathalos> Just seu Quee for the money.
[5:35:04] <%ThePuddingDead> not to mention getting provisions
[5:35:08] <+SpamKingRathalos> sue*
[5:35:09] <Nuvhok> LUL not upgrading for DD LUL WELP, this is going to be good
[5:35:14] <Ropcord> dibs on his stapler
[5:35:32] <%QueequegTheater> You have tons of shitty low-tier trinkets worth 1,000ish each
[5:35:34] <dukenux> Scuse me, i already dibed on the stapler

[5:35:51] <Ropcord> FeelsBadMan
[5:35:53] <simulationbard> Did he leave that plant behind, mine died and I want a new one
[5:35:53] <Tampaoster> and then done
[5:35:53] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Queequeg, we're gonna confiscate your work laptop while you talk with management. Can't have you deleting company work
[5:36:02] <%QueequegTheater> SEE HOW MUCH I CARE I AM STILL HELPING YOU
[5:36:19] <Intolerable> YUP
[5:36:23] <%Rezca> Unpaid Scab work
[5:36:23] <%QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus For a tier-3 boss, absolutely
[5:36:24] <+SpamKingRathalos> It would certainly help
[5:36:32] <%UrsulaCat> why not upgrade. it's just a game
[5:36:34] <oddly_offensive> Woolie needs a RL side Pet CO host
[5:36:35] <gunstar73> Yes it’s the last dungeon
[5:36:36] <+aversal_ammar> It would help a lot
[5:36:37] <%QueequegTheater> But do you ever actually use all 3
[5:36:39] <ducethegamer> sell all commons
[5:36:44] <Intolerable> YOU'RE WORSE THAN PAT
[5:36:45] <eddiemayfly> @WoolieVersus Most of your lesser trinkets should bring in between 1K to 1.5K. Upgrading healing would be reccommended.
[5:36:53] <%ThePuddingDead> @WoolieVersus Be prepared to lose someone or all call it a drop in the bucket
[5:37:03] <LucidInDarkness> Woolie has become Pat playing rpgs LUL
[5:37:13] <+Skunkjudge> Learned from the master
[5:37:27] <%ThePuddingDead> "Finale"
[5:37:35] <+WhyIDie> nah, if he's become pat, would probably take a break and come back power-leveled and with all the wiki knowledge
[5:37:40] <+SpamKingRathalos> You can do it Woolie!
[5:37:40] <+Skunkjudge> That's part of the fun, man
[5:37:42] <Ropcord> NO IT'S FINE
[5:37:51] <%QueequegTheater> Woolie is a bad employer, read my manifesto
[5:37:56] <+SpamKingRathalos> Cash go up, Trinket go down

[5:40:58] <%ThePuddingDead> bare minimum
[5:41:04] <Smaenus> Man I've been craving some DD lately, this isn't helping haha
[5:41:13] <%QueequegTheater> Woolie is a bad employer, read my manifesto. No, it's not free
[5:41:31] <+SpamKingRathalos> Quee was a bad employee
[5:41:35] <%QueequegTheater> Said manifesto may also be a Dark Souls/DBZ fanfiction
[5:41:39] <eddiemayfly> 8K should be good for the Dankest.
[5:41:40] <+SpamKingRathalos> Couldn't even retreat right
[5:41:40] <eddiemayfly> Sorta.

[5:42:58] <dukenux> Blindthrough
[5:42:58] <Shiranui24> and its a dungeon
[5:42:59] <%ThePuddingDead> @Smaenus I wouldn't say Pro, I'd say played enough of it to know close to all of it's bullshit pretty naturally, THIS run is make you piss blood
[5:42:59] <+aversal_ammar> Much bleeding
[5:43:00] <DevilBring3r> just go its fine
[5:43:14] <%ThePuddingDead> will*
[5:43:20] <+aversal_ammar> Eldritch out the asshole
[5:43:27] <%QueequegTheater> @ThePuddingDead And yet he sent ME in instead of you!
[5:43:35] <axivate_> >FINAL
[5:43:35] <eddiemayfly> @WoolieVersus Lots'a Eldritch and lots'a Arseholes. Unfortunately, there's no trinkets that affect arseholes.
[5:43:37] <+allups> just go
[5:43:37] <Vork88> i thought woolie playing draken gard lol;
[5:43:42] <Bustahhwulf> dont be a coward just go
[5:43:44] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Measure twice, cut once
[5:43:46] <Smaenus> @ThePuddingDead Ahh guess I know what I'm doing later then, after I dust off the wiki haha
[5:43:46] <FackinCrazy> @WoolieVersus What are the chances of a sekiro stream with pat to keep the tradition of you two playing fromsoft souls games together ?
[5:43:47] <+WhyIDie> you're worrying too much about it, just let it rock SeemsGood
[5:43:49] <%UrsulaCat> its just a game
[5:43:50] <%ThePuddingDead> @QueequegTheater Well to be faiiiir, I DID just start in the building todaaaaay soooooo...
[5:43:56] <%UrsulaCat> just go it's just game
[5:43:56] <+SpamKingRathalos> Technically this ain't the final dungeon, you gotta run it several times ;]
[5:43:57] <EASrake> Stalling
[5:44:11] <Nuvhok> a lot of bleed and stress in this one cap'n
[5:44:12] <aubrea> I havent played before is there no redos in this game? does it save if someone dies and stuff
[5:44:17] <Bustahhwulf> woolie is trying to timer scam the stream from the final dungeon
[5:44:26] <AthenOwl> im sure its a metaphorical challenge. Its the inner dungeon of your emotions
[5:44:27] <$SilverRoddo> Second-guessing stalling?
[5:44:28] <%ThePuddingDead> @WoolieVersus Seriously speaking tho Woolington, poisons, stuns and stress healing will help big time
[5:44:38] <simulationbard> Death Blow is a fake stat.
[5:44:43] <+lyfeindeyth> did woolie keep his reynauld alive?
[5:44:47] <+WhyIDie> @aubrea the game is built around a revolving door policy where you're pretty much always hiring new characters from the old ones dying off
[5:44:48] <+SpamKingRathalos> super fake stat
[5:44:51] <simulationbard> Prove me wrong Kappa
[5:45:00] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Don't you have a podcast about overthinking things? LUL
[5:45:04] <%ThePuddingDead> ^
[5:45:05] <aubrea> ah okay
[5:45:11] <aubrea> i dont want tarkus to die tho ;-;
[5:45:16] <+aversal_ammar> Give vestal super heals
[5:45:23] <+SpamKingRathalos> Its ok guys, Woolie gonna figure it out
[5:45:30] <%ThePuddingDead> @aubrea Question, has anyone come back from the dead for him yet?
[5:45:33] <%OthoZen> Chat someone tell me did my character die yet ?
[5:45:35] <abowlofapplejacks> Bastilla the hero has to survive
[5:45:38] <%QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus You should stack all your best healing trinkets on the Vestal
[5:45:46] <eddiemayfly> @Woolieversus You're gonna need some bleed resist for this one. If you take something that drops bleed resist, invest in bandaids.
[5:45:52] <%QueequegTheater> Then give Occultist all the eldritch damge buffs
[5:46:07] <aubrea> for tarkus or for woolie? idk anything about this game lol
[5:46:10] <+SpamKingRathalos> apatBig Yes
[5:46:17] <+aversal_ammar> Yeeeeee
[5:46:31] <%ThePuddingDead> @aubrea Woolz I mean, first time subbing but I love him and this game greatly

[5:47:01] <dan_g_v> Hey chat peoples, how is it going? How many sexy mods is Woolie playing with? :3
[5:47:05] <+aversal_ammar> Will vestal be safe with all that stress?
[5:47:09] <%QueequegTheater> High level trinkets are almost always the best options
[5:47:12] <eddiemayfly> @dan_g_v About none.
[5:47:13] <abowlofapplejacks> 0
[5:47:16] <%UrsulaCat> @dan_g_v 0
[5:47:17] <simulationbard> No mods, he's playing the base game
[5:47:18] <eddiemayfly> Give or take.
[5:47:19] <%QueequegTheater> @aversal_ammar she'll be fine
[5:47:22] <Trexbom> I believe in you dude
[5:47:24] <aubrea> I just lurk but i had a question about the game
[5:47:27] <%ThePuddingDead> @aversal_ammar NO ONE will be safe from that stress he's about to be hit with
[5:47:28] <Sphincter_Spelunker> no tiddie mods :(
[5:47:28] <%QueequegTheater> The other characters need the healing more
[5:47:29] <dan_g_v> bah, what's the point?

[5:48:09] <eddiemayfly> TFW no BIGG TIDD Omen Seeker.
[5:48:14] <%QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus That wasn't meant for you
[5:48:24] <Mashn2> Woolie tries to find happiness in Darkest Dungeon
[5:48:32] <%ThePuddingDead> Wait, is all this helping him count as spoilers?
[5:48:38] <%QueequegTheater> I'd add in some bleed resist personally
[5:48:40] <%UrsulaCat> looking for happiness in all the wrong places
[5:48:46] <eddiemayfly> Spoilers no. Backseating, the fuck yes.
[5:48:47] <%QueequegTheater> But that's up to opinion
[5:48:49] <+SpamKingRathalos> Experience is the best teacher

[6:12:03] <+galeforce_flier> !uptime
[6:12:12] <mostundesired> @ventus_fury It's fun, good amount of RNG so you have to do a lot of planning and resource management. Also, don't get attached to your heroes until they prove themselves.
[6:12:12] <+mechslayer71> @queequegtheater I never doubted her. I just said that woolie was using her as a crutch, and if she failed his team would instantly crumble
[6:12:13] <Tampaoster> party heals are better woolie
[6:12:13] <+WhyIDie> @ventus_fury if you like the feeling in roguelites where your constant struggle gets you some more progress with each attempt made, then you'll probably like it, but be prepared for RNG making that struggle real
[6:12:23] <NinjaGentleman> They Cant Read

[6:20:12] <+Nomicro4u> Plan out the stress heal next fight
[6:20:13] <+SpamKingRathalos> this shot decides it all
[6:20:13] <CurrySauseBandit> You don't have enough stress heal to overcome her infliction. You're better off just nuking tf out of them as you go through the dungeon.
[6:20:14] <eddiemayfly> Do a murder, Woolie.
[6:20:14] <Zebroneath> KILL
[6:20:14] <EASrake> oh well
[6:20:15] <+aversal_ammar> REINFORCEMENTS WILL COME

[6:20:53] <%QueequegTheater> Chat does he rest at the next middle row?
[6:20:55] <Nuvhok> camp time?
[6:20:57] <AlasterAngelo> a trifling victory
[6:20:59] <+Nomicro4u> Reinforcements come if you stall for too long
[6:21:03] <%ThePuddingDead> he can camp whenever
[6:21:05] <luckysteak> leaving two guys alive will prevent reinforcements
[6:21:05] <eddiemayfly> Camp time
[6:21:07] <$SilverRoddo> This is a dungeon has a stressful self-sustaining economy.
[6:21:12] <%ThePuddingDead> i wouldnt do it yet
[6:21:15] <%ThePuddingDead> way too early
[6:21:16] <grayjammer> If there's someone or something in your life that acts as a constant source of stress, just shoot it, with your gun.
[6:21:29] <%QueequegTheater> RIGHT
[6:21:30] <+SpamKingRathalos> hmm
[6:21:32] <%Piemen99> when can he camp
[6:21:36] <eddiemayfly> @WoolieVersus Right.

[6:21:37] <taptapmuhgap> @WoolieVersus Howdy Woolie!
[6:21:38] <gunstar73> Nah I’d wait for the rest of his party to be stressed
[6:21:44] <Gutsandlove> wait really?
[6:21:44] <Stofil42> i thought they changed it so you cant stall with two small units anymore
[6:21:45] <Intolerable> EAST
[6:21:46] <Shiranui24> down (i know nothing)
[6:21:47] <gunstar73> Right
[6:21:47] <SmokeMcCloud> YOU ARE NOT THE FLAME!
[6:21:47] <CrimsonFox777> East/Right
[6:21:47] <HammerNNail> You actually have to leave 3 alive now, assuming you're playing on the most recent patch.
[6:21:49] <Zebroneath> Right
[6:21:49] <grayjammer> East
[6:21:51] <IsThisOne> Right is right

[6:25:39] <eddiemayfly> @WoolieVersus A bit of a tip: Tracking Shot ptovides a pretty damn decent Dmg and Acc buff that lasts for the entire fight. It's usually a good start.
[6:25:39] <+SpamKingRathalos> OH YEAH
[6:25:40] <JanusII> Woolie only likes taking big hits.
[6:25:41] <Stofil42> @WoolieVersus there are no stealth units in DD so you might want to replace tracking shot

[6:25:50] <+gwanzan> Rave Zombie is the coolest

[6:39:06] <eddiemayfly> Not at this point there ain't.
[6:39:06] <%QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus You have to sacrifice a character
[6:39:07] <luckysteak> you will sac a dude to do it
[6:39:08] <Sphincter_Spelunker> not without sac'ing one guy
[6:39:09] <+SpamKingRathalos> YES
[6:39:09] <Stofil42> @WoolieVersus someone dies when you back down
[6:39:10] <Raymanguy13> don't be a Tarkus
[6:39:10] <Intolerable> YESA
[6:39:10] <LVDoomien> @WoolieVersus you'll automatically lose a single guy
[6:39:11] <CrimsonFox777> Technically, you can escape, but.......
[6:39:11] <%QueequegTheater> NOOOOO
[6:39:11] <tremerss> theres running with a death
[6:39:12] <+paladinstarbuster> you did it twice

[6:39:24] <matrignomy7> Bastillas all like "Y'all are boring."
[6:39:26] <HammerNNail> There's running but you sacrifice a character. I'd recommend continuing.
[6:39:27] <CopperTucker> @WoolieVersus you can run, but someone will die
[6:39:28] <SharpFence998> SOMEONE DIES
[6:39:28] <+combustable1> THERES A BIG CATCH

[6:39:41] <%ventus_fury> Sacrifice the heart attack
[6:39:42] <Ceuscadu> Running out of the DD means one guy dies, I think. It's iffy if you only have one left.

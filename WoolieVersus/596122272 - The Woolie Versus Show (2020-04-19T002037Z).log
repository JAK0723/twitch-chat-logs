[0:19:34] <+Cavumentum> Tonight somebody's gona get SCALPED
[0:19:38] <%ekodrop> splitting the pool would make everything pointless
[0:19:51] <%bigmacjack12> No splitting, only blood
[0:19:52] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:20:30] <%yeetdabsenpai69> darklington feeds on blood for he gains the strengths of its owner

[0:20:37] <vapeking42069> anime viewer can someone give me a last time on dokapon?
[0:20:42] <%yeetdabsenpai69> this is why darklington is stronger than any other
[0:20:53] <%ekodrop> i did request that woolie dole out the cash on stream
[0:20:55] <%andrei11dr> Minh will probably get fucked today, because he wants to use the wings, but he'll probably be stuck in the mountain
[0:20:58] <%yeetdabsenpai69> those who wish to live must submit to darklington
[0:21:26] <%yeetdabsenpai69> darklington may let you live yet if you die
[0:21:35] <%yeetdabsenpai69> for darklington is wise
[0:21:49] <%andrei11dr> But i believe in Minh, he's my Gozu Theno
[0:21:58] <%yeetdabsenpai69> darklington can defeat all his foes with the flick of his wrist\
[0:22:01] <%legacy0117> That song man. I got it on my favorites...Reminds you of the sacrifices made to get so far.
[0:22:17] <+Cavumentum> #ReggieGang
[0:22:20] <%yeetdabsenpai69> Minh is nothing compared to nothing compared to Darklington
[0:22:31] <vapeking42069> why are you all saying darklington, last episode of the anime woolie was a god warrior
[0:22:40] <%yeetdabsenpai69> Reggie's feeble gang will barely be noticed by darklington
[0:22:57] <%Superblooms> @bigmacjack12 Thanks for the gift sub! oh snap thanks bro
[0:22:59] <%legacy0117> Because this is the Manga dude.
[0:23:26] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @vapeking42069 for darklington will equalise those that robbed him and make himslf stronger than any other
[0:23:51] <Triplicat> YEAH TRUNKS THEME
[0:24:06] <gustavozxd> time for hatred?
[0:24:12] <%yeetdabsenpai69> darklington would advise you to flee for his might alone would spoil the whole adventure and destroy any enjoyment
[0:24:30] <%yeetdabsenpai69> thank arklington for his mercy in sparing you in this
[0:24:40] <+TyphloJian> I wish this game wasn't +70$ on ebay
[0:25:08] <%SuperKirby24> @typhlojian I mean... theres always the alternative Kappa
[0:25:15] <%yeetdabsenpai69> darklington will spare those that believed in him from before his ascension
[0:25:28] <%yeetdabsenpai69> he will destroy thosethat even doubted him for 1 second
[0:25:36] <%legacy0117> Who knows, it is probably that expensive because of what's happening IRL.
[0:25:52] <%andrei11dr> Why would you be one Woolies side ,we established that he's the law path in this story
[0:26:02] <%emperordread> Just woke up from a long sleep on a rough day and I see Dokapon is on the cards? Hell yeah, what a treat!

[0:29:04] <+pectusumbra> this song is familiar
[0:29:10] <gustavozxd> i'm not rooting for anyone to win, just woolie to lose
[0:29:17] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[0:29:21] <gustavozxd> so we can get RAW salt out of him
[0:29:23] <+pectusumbra> I just want to see some dope shit myself.
[0:29:26] <%yeetdabsenpai69> BUT as they seemed proud of their HERESY there punishment will be SEVERELY WORSE for darklington knows ways to hurt us for the rest of our life
[0:29:28] <%bigmacjack12> TEAM REGGIE, RIDE OR DIE
[0:29:32] <Daba_mk2> I want everyone to lose some how
[0:29:37] <+Grayhammatter> same
[0:29:56] <+pectusumbra> If Minh climbs the mountain that's gonna be so DUMB

[0:30:04] <+Cavumentum> Reggie Gang
[0:30:04] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @gustavozxd you dare wish ILL on Darklington?
[0:30:10] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> @pectusumbra In what way?
[0:30:16] <%SuperKirby24> watch the save file get corrupted on the very last stage LUL
[0:30:22] <%andrei11dr> So we need to get things straight, we established that Woolie is the Law path, Minh is Chaos path, so wat should Reggie be? he ain't no hero
[0:30:26] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @gustavozxd know their is no bravery in standing in his way only foolishness
[0:30:28] <gustavozxd> @Daba_mk2 "hey everyone, woolie minh and reggie are no longer friends"
[0:30:31] <+pectusumbra> Imagine Minh literally becoming A Hero
[0:30:32] <+Grayhammatter> then they would have to play it all over again
[0:30:40] <%bigmacjack12> Reggie is the foot path
[0:30:43] <Persona_EX> @andrei11dr you're right he's MY hero
[0:30:46] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> @grayhammatter Run it back!!!

[0:31:21] <%yeetdabsenpai69> those of you that are yet to be converted know that your punishment MAY be lessened by devoting yourself toHis service
[0:31:27] <+Cavumentum> All three are just becoming different anime villain types
[0:31:32] <+thespacerunaway> I will gladly donate to the blood pool
[0:31:35] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> @pectusumbra Depends how he acts first
[0:31:35] <%andrei11dr> The story of Dokapon has no heroes, just different evils
[0:31:48] <aka_Jigawatt> 3==D~~~
[0:31:58] <$jobbedbone> guys help me think of groceries to get
[0:32:01] <%purplehermit12> I mean for reggie it was the satsui no hado @pectusumbra
[0:32:02] <+pectusumbra> That's fair, my personal vote is for Diavolo style though with This is a Test and epi-dreads
[0:32:06] <preppyposs> there is no honor
[0:32:06] <+Grayhammatter> SourPls
[0:32:10] <preppyposs> only blood and salt
[0:32:12] <+thespacerunaway> @yeetdabsenpai69 I think diavolo is the way to go
[0:32:19] <%SuperKirby24> this bass slap Kappa
[0:32:23] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @pectusumbra darklington is above all thse feeble ones none may stand in his path for his power transcend anything we can think of tremble in his sight
[0:32:25] <dastmwolf> so are gonna get darklington this session?
[0:32:29] <%EyeFarted> When did we cross into Eli's playlist??
[0:32:29] <%andrei11dr> @jobbedbone Make yourself mexican food

[0:32:47] <+Grayhammatter> SourPls
[0:32:47] <%yeetdabsenpai69> his acceptane of your existance is a danger to anything you hold dear
[0:32:49] <%emperordread> Darklington gonna play those Devil Games
[0:32:51] <KNYGHT87> RPGAyaya
[0:32:54] <%yeetdabsenpai69> PRAISED BE DARKLINGTON
[0:32:54] <+pectusumbra> So that's a Diavolo vote, got it. We did also confirm that epitath is twitch chat
[0:32:54] <%legacy0117> Woolie as Kenshiro with his own stand. Minh as the Demonic Speedrunner Mario. And Reggie, as Nero. Who will survive?...The biggest clash yet, coming soon.
[0:33:03] <$jobbedbone> ITS THAT X FILES SONG
[0:33:32] <%yeetdabsenpai69> Darklington has beaten them alrady @legacy0117
[0:33:54] <+pectusumbra> Oh yeah! I also realized at random today, I think Woolie and Kojima might have a Jotaro/Dio thing going on where they have the same stand
[0:33:56] <%yeetdabsenpai69> for darklington wins fight by simply having been thought of
[0:34:13] <%legacy0117> It depends if Kenshiro will turn to the dark side or not.
[0:34:14] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:34:20] <%yeetdabsenpai69> even if a foe would be able to beat him th fact he exist in someones thoughts brings him back
[0:34:53] <%yeetdabsenpai69> darklington destroys all that those standing in his way hold dear
[0:34:53] <Saltmeisterr> heyo
[0:35:03] <worldbrand> oh shit
[0:35:05] <yodajr99> @yeetdabsenpai69 like ansem
[0:35:29] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @Saltmeisterr does thou accept Darklington as the true lord and he who must be whorshiped at all times
[0:35:29] <%FuqBoiSlim> Darklington WILL rise this chapter. I know it PowerUpL woolieDATTEBAYO PowerUpR
[0:35:50] <+kekkerscrew> This is the moment that the manga has been building up to from day one
[0:35:53] <%yeetdabsenpai69> Darklington does't raise he merely brings down all that oppose him

[0:36:11] <yodajr99> pizza time
[0:36:19] <+thespacerunaway> so excited to join the cool kids in manga town

[0:36:37] <yodajr99> darklington will fall to reggie
[0:36:38] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> wooliePOYO
[0:36:47] <%FuqBoiSlim> Squid1 Squid2 Squid3 Squid4
[0:36:48] <+Grayhammatter> woolie going darkling today?
[0:36:48] <+pectusumbra> I think Woolie will try to resist a bit, then get his shit pushed in and lose it
[0:36:55] <%SuperKirby24> spamming darkling when for all we know he could do worse than reggie cuz game rng LUL
[0:36:57] <yodajr99> the regginator will conquer
[0:37:06] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @andrei11dr you dare assume Darklington can Fail?
[0:37:08] <%yeetdabsenpai69> HERESY
[0:37:09] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> He shouldn’t wait a second I think
[0:37:27] <%FuqBoiSlim> Woolie's having his own chimera ant arc right now. it's only a matter of time before he goes full heel
[0:37:37] <+thespacerunaway> lol
[0:37:42] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @SuperKirby24 why would you risk all that you love by insulting Him?
[0:37:44] <%andrei11dr> @yeetdabsenpai69 Have you seen wat happened too Reggie?
[0:37:45] <yodajr99> chimera ants suck
[0:37:47] <%Th3SmartAlec> Can't wait for Woolie 200 IQ explanation for backing down for Darkling
[0:38:06] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @andrei11dr reggie is not the ALMIGTHY Darklington
[0:38:08] <Persona_EX> and so it begins
[0:38:10] <SpookySpaghooti> Are we getting a Dokapon video tonight?
[0:38:13] <%jiggy_snipe> Reggie's darkling just helped him with levels
[0:38:20] <SpookySpaghooti> Or is this a Manga Only day
[0:38:20] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> @th3smartalec And continues to get saltier and saltier? Yeah that would be infuriating
[0:38:20] <%Th3SmartAlec> @SpookySpaghooti ye, should be any second now
[0:38:20] <%yeetdabsenpai69> merely cmparing th two is a grave insult
[0:38:21] <megaminimechamocha> Will we see a live murder tonight?
[0:38:31] <%Solidnick18> maybe
[0:38:35] <SpookySpaghooti> @Th3SmartAlec I've been looking forward all day to it, thanks
[0:38:41] <megaminimechamocha> What is the BLOODPOOL up to?
[0:38:46] <%andrei11dr> I'm on team Minh because this game is horseshit
[0:38:56] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> Last I heard it was 1500+
[0:38:57] <%emperordread> Twitch gonna end up like LiveLeak @megaminimechamocha
[0:39:02] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @Th3SmartAlec (im actually gonna get SO FUCKING mad after all my hype)

[0:39:21] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> Yeah...who knows what it is today though
[0:39:26] <%SuperKirby24> I swear for some reason my mind thinks we almost hit 3k for the bloodpool
[0:39:26] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> Like 500?
[0:39:27] <+thespacerunaway> where is the donation to blood pool?
[0:39:29] <Josef_Stryker> So has blood been shed at any point in the last few streams?
[0:39:30] <+Grayhammatter> OOF
[0:39:40] <samuraijakanddaxter> cant wait for more adventures of hero minh
[0:39:44] <%andrei11dr> I was originally on team Reggie but I lost all fucking hope
[0:39:49] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> Normal donation, just signify its for blood pool
[0:39:53] <megaminimechamocha> They should have gotten EPW to join this game tbh
[0:39:57] <+thespacerunaway> hmm ok cool

[0:40:12] <%Jetzord> @megaminimechamocha That would end in actual murder
[0:40:13] <Persona_EX> i've yet to see a proper 4 player long ass game of this
[0:40:13] <%jiggy_snipe> @andrei11dr were you here last stream?
[0:40:14] <+aslfrasle> As someone who's only been watching the VoDs, I just wanted to pop in and ask whether Minh gets the karma he deserves?
[0:40:18] <Persona_EX> everyone does a 3 player

As such I was wondering if you had any plans to push the anime release of that part which fixes these problems sometime soon?

[1:47:42] <yodajr99> dang
[1:47:42] <Maleicus> he moved to much
[1:47:42] <C4m3r0n0409> LOL
[1:47:43] <+KeithTheHuman> he can still roll for saturation
[1:47:45] <CobaltPhoenix27> inb4 he rolls 200
[1:47:45] <Mr_Strut> The dark lord bides his time
[1:47:56] <+pectusumbra> that first roadblock will go away soon
[1:47:57] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @superdandy96 best gear In the game for grabs
[1:47:58] <+OneGorillionDollars> The seals that contain woolie slowly crumble
[1:48:01] <%caffienatedjedi> @Superdandy96 They get at least one of the best items in the game if they beat the Darkling.
[1:48:01] <%TheOneUpWarrior> yo
[1:48:05] <%legacy0117> Then they become Dante or Vergil. Simple.
[1:48:13] <%Superdandy96> @yeetdabsenpai69 WOW
[1:48:14] <%emperordread> Reggie pulled some 4th Hokage and used the seal no jutsu to trap in the 9 tails
[1:48:17] <Zourath> At this point he's pretty much guaranteed a castle steal at the very least.
[1:48:18] <crimsonsaens> Minh's plays are as wack as Reggie's
[1:48:18] <%nintega010> @Superdandy96 that is very hard. you need like the best class and charge and be a high level
[1:48:19] <%purplehermit12> @caffienatedjedi yeah but the only way for them to beat that is counter.
[1:48:19] <preppyposs> MINH IS 500IQ
[1:48:30] <+AnthraxJohnson> Get shit on Woolie. #Minh4TheWin
[1:48:31] <+BoboDaHobo> how long do blocks last?
[1:48:39] <Maleicus> random turns
[1:48:43] <yodajr99> till you break them
[1:48:43] <%emperordread> only a couple of days @BoboDaHobo
[1:48:43] <phatmac16> F
[1:48:44] <%lotharrio> So the question is, when does Reggie's Vanish wear off?
[1:48:47] <%gearcannon> wooliePOYO
[1:48:49] <+moink1234> Is reggie still in 1st? Please tell me that reggie is still in 1st
[1:48:50] <%caffienatedjedi> @purplehermit12 Right now, yeah. Once they get to mid-late game it becomes more viable to win against darkling.
[1:48:55] <+paladinstarbuster> Yes
[1:48:55] <+pectusumbra> worst case, Woolie can just take another go at darkling in another few weeks after the economy is fucking dead
[1:48:59] <Paul_Cheenis_Big_Beenis> The righteous protagonist has sealed the vile evil
[1:49:02] <+moink1234> Awesome
[1:49:02] <%Superdandy96> The Hype when Reggie beats Darklington Kappa
[1:49:07] <+Target616> I think its 2-3 vanishes needed to last an entire darkling run
[1:49:10] <Xeno351> minh should make a deal with woolie to use the mattock
[1:49:18] <crossing_mao> Remember when everyone and their mother was saying Mihn would be 1st Darkling?
[1:49:20] <+Deft_Thought> Can you use the Soul Mop to remove Darkling?
[1:49:21] <+soFISHticated98> think he sold it
[1:49:24] <%jiggy_snipe> if Woolie doesn't cause COMPLETE GLOBAL SATURATION, he
[1:49:26] <+kekkerscrew> hopefully someone clipped Reggie the hero Sealing the vial demon
[1:49:27] <%purplehermit12> 5
[1:49:28] <%ekodrop> reggie's turns take forever
[1:49:30] <%jiggy_snipe> will just do it again

[2:15:53] <+soFISHticated98> Ninja is a Warrior for this
[2:15:53] <%legacy0117> Good luck landing the hit on the Darkling's speed tho.
[2:15:55] <GeltonZ> Suffer...like G did?
[2:15:57] <+MrRabbles> which one ?

[2:16:33] <%emperordread> but which one do you want though?
[2:16:34] <+soFISHticated98> because it requires warrior to learn
[2:16:34] <aeonicvector> Chi knuckle is great tho, since now its forced to use sneak
[2:16:34] <SethKyu> You unlock Ninja by mastering warrior
[2:16:40] <LysdexicAndVolingit> !uptime

[2:18:57] <ManlyMcBeefington> Castle is more long term gain damage

[2:27:01] <GKannel> west
[2:27:01] <reonome> you should go to the later continents
[2:27:02] <%Fujiwara_92> JOURNEY TO THE WEST
[2:27:03] <%legacy0117> Castles normally can't be taken over by random monsters, towns can. Castles are more reliable and worthy more.
[2:27:05] <yeildingthought> Weest
[2:27:05] <C4m3r0n0409> STAY NEAR RED DEMON
[2:27:07] <+soFISHticated98> Go near that weapon shop
[2:27:10] <+Dimfish> he wants to be in the west once the scramble for towns happens
[2:27:11] <%nintega010> go near the objective
[2:27:14] <%agumon9000> Go west!
[2:27:19] <dastmwolf> 8d chess only goes one turn ahead. he's only weakness
[2:27:23] <C4m3r0n0409> Go to demon
[2:27:28] <DXLelouch24> @woolieversus end darklingdom near a weaponshop trust me
[2:27:28] <+AnthraxJohnson> brownSLEEP
[2:27:29] <+soFISHticated98> ok well one more tuen
[2:27:31] <+soFISHticated98> one more turn
[2:27:32] <+Dimfish> garonna isnt a bad choice
[2:27:33] <%gatorafan> West coast best coast
[2:27:37] <RevolverBobkat> he still needs to get equiptment first
[2:27:37] <%viewtifulr> the moment woolie out of dark mode reggoe is gonna rust him
[2:27:38] <heroicspiritavenger> BAHSAHKAH
[2:27:38] <%GenesisKnight> My love for you is like a truck BERSERKER
[2:27:41] <%legacy0117> That toooo. Weapon shop is wiseeee.
[2:27:42] <TigerClaws12> 1 more BlessRNG
[2:27:54] <kulmoth> ! MORE
[2:27:54] <%Urdunngurdunn> Mountain please
[2:27:58] <+Grayhammatter> go to the mountain minh
[2:28:01] <crimsonsaens> You need money before hitting the weapon shop though
[2:28:03] <+pectusumbra> time to climb the mountain minh
[2:28:04] <%agumon9000> Mountain!
[2:28:08] <%nintega010> @viewtifulr he has no equipment to break
[2:28:12] <yeildingthought> Mountain
[2:28:17] <C4m3r0n0409> why
[2:28:21] <%jiggy_snipe> why
[2:28:21] <%Fujiwara_92> LUL
[2:28:22] <+Dimfish> mountain would be a bad move before the town scramble
[2:28:25] <%invisi_bliss> LUL
[2:28:25] <%plus_on_black> Woolie should have been fighting these guys
[2:28:27] <BreakersAweigh> LUL
[2:28:27] <DerpioParty> A CASTLE IS FINE TOO
[2:28:29] <%jiggy_snipe> a castle is still great lol
[2:28:30] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie you can always get a castle
[2:28:31] <+MrRabbles> brace for failure
[2:28:32] <%yeetdabsenpai69> YOUVE GOT THIS DARKLINgTON
[2:28:32] <%GenesisKnight> Nice dodge
[2:28:35] <%lotharrio> Woolie, you should have summoned them in much earlier.
[2:28:40] <%jiggy_snipe> do they not understand the value of castles?
[2:28:41] <SethKyu> I hope woolie gets 200 on the dark spinner
[2:28:42] <%Fujiwara_92> EITHER A NUKE OR A CASTLE WOOLS
[2:28:43] <%emperordread> Woolie will get auto countered on next dark arts point spinner LUL
[2:28:43] <%SuperKirby24> JUST BELIEVE IN YOURSELF
[2:28:44] <goose_attack_almanac> Woolie shoulda dragged them to him while he was in the roadblock
[2:28:48] <%Fujiwara_92> IT'S IN THE BAG
[2:28:49] <irfan_> barely killed, damn
[2:28:52] <%NecDW4> So... bets on woolie putting a controller through the wall if he rolls a zero?
[2:28:53] <Idon__> Griffith: I... simply follwed my dream.
[2:28:54] <%viewtifulr> @nintega010 when dark mode is over weapons are retained so theres that part to clear what i ment
[2:28:54] <Spydurman> Woolie's inner balance is lost
[2:28:57] <+soFISHticated98> Minh had a billion warps
[2:29:01] <%neraren> No bet
[2:29:04] <+IxDomxI> are your actions those of justice?
[2:29:07] <%purplehermit12> minh had 8 billlion warps and reggie was vanished
[2:29:08] <%xcompleasedad> @NecDW4 Too likely
[2:29:09] <+soFISHticated98> there was no point to trapping them behind a roadblock
[2:29:10] <Mr_Strut> Woolie got the calm fury
[2:29:10] <%nintega010> @viewtifulr ahh ok
[2:29:12] <%purplehermit12> Come here would have done nothing
[2:29:13] <+MrAtheGreat> The sun always rises tomorrow.
[2:29:13] <%fetrigon> Reggie it's a black hole
[2:29:14] <WhiteTetsu> everyone aavoided fighting him
[2:29:14] <+soFISHticated98> they wouldn't be trapped
[2:29:15] <SchwaAkari> Watch him roll a 200 at the last second and have no way to use all the points
[2:29:15] <+Invlux> ! Balance at Risk !
[2:29:18] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:29:18] <$Rezca> the safety
[2:29:21] <%fetrigon> We all know that
[2:29:21] <+Dimfish> woolie spreads his ass live on stream if he gets a zero
[2:29:33] <%legacy0117> At least he'll have time to arm himself before Minh and Reggie descend upon his vulnerable form as soon as it is over.
[2:29:36] <%viewtifulr> get that zero for balance woolie
[2:29:36] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[2:29:43] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Got it
[2:29:43] <+MrRabbles> no zero

[2:29:47] <%jiggy_snipe> ok
[2:29:47] <%Th3SmartAlec> All good
[2:29:50] <+MrAtheGreat> Which is better for Chat? Woolie rolling a 0 or Woolie rolling a 200?

[2:54:24] <%agumon9000> @WoolieVersus Woolie you were too greedy. You should have gone after a blank space like chat was telling you
[2:54:26] <%legacy0117> Oh, that's a mechanic I wasn't aware of.....Oh boy....That is a scary thing that....
[2:54:29] <+GimmMeUhSammich> Town Warp would be busted right now

[2:54:36] <%Fujiwara_92> ARE YOU SURE CHAT? SoonerLater
[2:54:36] <gustavozxd> the rich getting richer
[2:54:38] <SchwaAkari> He didn't lose any EXP, he simply allowed Reggie to catch up instantly
[2:54:40] <C4m3r0n0409> lets find out next fight
[2:54:41] <+pectusumbra> Chat is full of shit
[2:54:41] <+tearknack> seriously chat, those of you who haven't played dokapon (like me) don't jsut assume people who say stuff about the game actually know anything
[2:54:42] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Hawkbone_ The issue is that chat has no other explanation for why Reggie got all that EXP
[2:54:43] <T_Sasquatch> Is there a compilation of best moments ?? I can feel woolies rage
[2:54:43] <%SuperKirby24> ok what happun

[2:54:54] <%Hawkbone_> As much as I want Woolie to lose, I like seeing Chat get BTFO more, so I hope Woolie gets that XP
[2:54:54] <%emperordread> This is literally rising of the shield hero, when the MC exposes the king and princess as cheaters he forces his name to change as well LUL

[2:55:08] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @hawkbone_ he will
[2:55:17] <+pectusumbra> it's simply that the game is fucking not coded well so it can't fix shit properly till a fight

[2:56:31] <SchwaAkari> Yeah that Darkling turn was not the wisest course
[2:56:31] <%legacy0117> If he can still cash the exp, then that's fair.

[2:58:26] <+Dimfish> bloodpool is over 2k
[2:58:29] <+fizzguy47> plausible deniability
[2:58:30] <iggeh> he's just confidently misinforming you he's not lying

[2:58:41] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> People are gonna die at the end of this series
[2:58:42] <%Hawkbone_> wen u walkin'
[2:58:44] <gustavozxd> i think the mics are bit too close to them
[2:58:44] <NeroInfinite> Posion
[2:58:47] <%nothuzad> still hasnt gone to the mountain :V
[2:58:51] <%neraren> Climb the mountain with the wings
[2:58:59] <C4m3r0n0409> Item space
[2:59:07] <%plus_on_black> Reggie got the juice.
[2:59:09] <crimsonsaens> Minh should take all of the towns before climbing the mountain though
[2:59:09] <C4m3r0n0409> mountain is right there
[2:59:13] <%Fujiwara_92> MINH MOUNTAIN
[2:59:21] <+GimmMeUhSammich> THE WINGS
[2:59:22] <+Grayhammatter> the mountain
[2:59:26] <+Dimfish> mountain wont happen till all towns are taken again
[2:59:27] <Klefth> Chat, rolling a 1 is hard
[2:59:33] <NeroInfinite> SUPER SPINNER
[2:59:35] <yodajr99> he can't even get the item
[2:59:41] <C4m3r0n0409> 4 spinner it will work
[2:59:42] <yodajr99> I mean mountain
[2:59:47] <SchwaAkari> Are we gonna see Minh climb the mountain?? Heaven is the one area of the game I have never seen
[2:59:47] <Shinny1338> he just bought a bunch of items
[2:59:51] <WhiteTetsu> mountain takes to long with towns free
[3:00:04] <C4m3r0n0409> WHY
[3:00:08] <C4m3r0n0409> YOU HAVE NOTHING
[3:00:11] <$Rezca> business opportunities
[3:00:18] <SchwaAkari> Racing for the towns is probably the smarter choice
[3:00:25] <%jiggy_snipe> go make the King love you Reggie
[3:00:27] <SchwaAkari> At least some of them
[3:00:28] <Gramcracker55> they let you get to a secret area.
[3:00:30] <C4m3r0n0409> Get more towns dude
[3:00:33] <crimsonsaens> The value of the towns in the south are actually pretty high value
[3:00:33] <%legacy0117> Heaven sounds nice. Probably will kick your ass out if your not purified.
[3:00:35] <dastmwolf> PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[3:00:39] <+pectusumbra> Minh, you WANT to do that
[3:00:55] <SethKyu> To invest, you have to be at the castle
[3:00:56] <%nintega010> the mountain will be for later
[3:01:02] <SethKyu> Can't do it from the bank
[3:01:03] <+Gespens> Guys, he doesn't have the requirements for the BRAVE
[3:01:05] <SchwaAkari> After that you can use the Spring Cave to hurriedly get back to the south continent (though I doubt any of them know what Spring Cave does, still)
[3:01:09] <%Fujiwara_92> I'm rooting for Woolie because chat's a booli PunOko
[3:01:25] <+soFISHticated98> Woolie was a smug ass bitch in the beginning
[3:01:26] <Shinny1338> isn't the wings for all classes mastered first?
[3:01:31] <crimsonsaens> Hero requirements are nutty, he can get good equipment on the mountain though
[3:01:31] <Gramcracker55> there is good equipment at the top of the mountain but I'm not sure if it's worth the effort.
[3:01:33] <Klefth> They're all preeetty far from the wings stuff
[3:01:34] <yodajr99> woolie or reggie minh must lose
[3:01:34] <+Gespens> Red Chest!

[3:35:27] <C4m3r0n0409> ATTACK
[3:35:29] <SchwaAkari> This one's weaker and doesn't have boss music
[3:35:32] <TheHardM> It lasts for like, two or three days.
[3:35:33] <SchwaAkari> I don't think it has a Royal Ring
[3:35:34] <C4m3r0n0409> OH FUCK
[3:35:35] <NeroInfinite> it's BUFF
[3:35:35] <vexicbayn> yikes
[3:35:37] <+MrAtheGreat> m guard
[3:35:37] <+Grayhammatter> OH FUCK
[3:35:39] <+pectusumbra> Woolie's weapon is just really bad
[3:35:44] <%nintega010> He needs a new weapon
[3:35:44] <hectic_harlequin> Shit
[3:35:47] <%purplehermit12> Woolie has shit gear
[3:35:48] <%jiggy_snipe> Woolie has bad equipment
[3:35:48] <%ChoculaUltra> c h i l l e r
[3:35:53] <%nothuzad> all of them underestimating magic
[3:35:55] <haisho> Woolie in desperate need of better gear
[3:35:56] <%yeetdabsenpai69> GET NEW WEAPON YOU WEAK
[3:35:57] <Ultimatefool> Good thing Woolie is a TANK
[3:36:00] <%JeoDood> woolie has bad gear
[3:36:01] <%purplehermit12> Reggie needs better defensive magic
[3:36:01] <DiscoDur0> Next chapter, should shop for a hot weapon
[3:36:03] <bursky00> woolie has no attack
[3:36:03] <vexicbayn> fuckin Gearless Woolie tonight
[3:36:07] <TheHardM> Just get better defensive magic.
[3:36:09] <C4m3r0n0409> WOOLIE IS WEAK AF
[3:36:11] <WhiteTetsu> it the cold
[3:36:14] <%yeknomlive> cold squares para you
[3:36:15] <DiscoDur0> Snow space
[3:36:15] <%Superdandy96> Woolie’s bad equipment has come to screw him over!
[3:36:15] <SethKyu> Nah, it's the snow
[3:36:15] <%yeetdabsenpai69> no it's the cold
[3:36:17] <Junkles> snow wihout warm gloves = paralysis
[3:36:18] <crimsonsaens> Paralysis just happens from snowy areas
[3:36:23] <+Grayhammatter> town warps mihn
[3:36:23] <WhiteTetsu> no warm gloves on
[3:36:24] <crossing_mao> History repeats itself....
[3:36:24] <+MrAtheGreat> I still think Woolie's greatest mistake is not hitting the weapon store when he had the money
[3:36:24] <privatesargent> its not paralysis traps, you get paralysis when you are on snow without warm gloves
[3:36:30] <%Th3SmartAlec> If Woolie manages to level up he can get Reggie
[3:36:31] <Gramcracker55> if you aren't going for magic you don't invest in magic.
[3:36:33] <+soFISHticated98> yeah
[3:36:37] <kingkeldeo31> That's what the warm gloves prevent
[3:36:39] <+soFISHticated98> that was like 2 sessions ago though
[3:36:43] <+MrAtheGreat> @privatesargent WOOOOOW realy?!
[3:36:44] <Zalthia> I know it’s satisfying to see Reggie in first now- but jeeze Woolie really fell behind
[3:36:45] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @mrathegreat it was
[3:36:47] <TheHardM> I mean, all advice probably won't be reaching them, I'm assuming that they aren't reading chat.
[3:36:51] <C4m3r0n0409> remember when woolie was super rich and didn't buy a sword
[3:36:55] <%nintega010> minh could warp and kill reggie
[3:36:55] <BulletproofMoon> the latest manga chapter is out? sick.
[3:36:57] <%purplehermit12> @Gramcracker55 Spending money on a better defensive magic isnt bad. you're crazy.

[3:58:24] <%Hawkbone_> @razorgem They are the most mad that ANY game has ever made them. No other video on the entire channel reaches even HALF the salt this game makes them produce
[3:58:25] <DSD24> Cool people are named Roche
[3:58:28] <%yeknomlive> they stock up
[3:58:30] <TheHardM> Every loss builds up the cash.

[3:59:05] <SchwaAkari> @Hawkbone_ I don't know if this counts, but Omikron The Nomad Soul tilted Woolie harder than this game has thus far
[3:59:10] <spardanwarrior> Doesn't that make him Mr. Shakedown?
[3:59:13] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @razorgem this a wee channel so probably
[3:59:13] <%jiggy_snipe> so he keeps buiilding up gold, thats cool

[4:33:08] <munster_zero> this was good, I liked this
[4:33:08] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1250251023865786369?s=20
[4:33:08] <%legacy0117> Darkling will have a hard limit I imagine, or they will figure out ways to kill it.
[4:33:13] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[4:33:17] <%Superdandy96> Remember when Woolz and Reggie we’re having fun in Guilty gear?
[4:33:17] <%viewtifulr> Hate for our dense hero reggie
[4:33:17] <%Th3SmartAlec> Darkling = X Factor
[4:33:29] <Duke_of_HI> what a good manga volume
[4:33:30] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> wooliePOYO
[4:33:35] <%kyh9> Dokapon reveals people's nature
[4:33:38] <%jiggy_snipe> Darkling brought balance but Woolie messed up by letting Reggie get that exp
[4:33:41] <Tooniearcade> OWL2019Pharah
[4:33:50] <Nolat885> woolieCHAN
[4:34:10] <%neraren> reggie eould have got that xp either way
[4:34:15] <%neraren> That Fenrir was tough
[4:34:19] <jubejube56> Err idk if dark arts are dodgable
[4:34:26] <%neraren> He took advantage while woolie was weak
[4:34:27] <+kekkerscrew> COME HERE isn't Dodgable
[4:34:28] <%saltpiggu> Darkling just makes it work i think
[4:34:32] <%Livelinne> lomBurn lomBurn lomBurn
[4:34:34] <atema128> This manga arc really stepped it up with the plotting and twists, this volume is gonna sell gang busters.
[4:34:44] <%legacy0117> Is it finally ending? Thank goodness.
[4:34:46] <%jiggy_snipe> but Woolie wouldn't have been weak if he cashed in his exp 1st maybe
[4:34:47] <+dmtjinni> Woolz
[4:34:59] <causewaybob> Are we wrapping up?
[4:35:01] <C4m3r0n0409> Woolie you made bad plays
[4:35:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> Power bottom
[4:35:05] <crimsonsaens> Woolie could've straight up hit 2nd or 1st if he took a second castle
[4:35:05] <%nintega010> It's just way closer
[4:35:10] <Paul_Cheenis_Big_Beenis> And you completely deserve it
[4:35:16] <C4m3r0n0409> You tried to fight the boss before getting xp
[4:35:17] <%Rhinoprotoss> I really hope Woolie never recovers
[4:35:18] <%neraren> That fenrir hit for 90% of his hp when he guessed right, it woulda hurt either way imo
[4:35:19] <%purplehermit12> its closer, it was your actions AFTER darkling that you messed up on woolie.
[4:35:26] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> Glad he didn’t. I want Reggie to win
[4:35:29] <%Fujiwara_92> THE MORE THINGS CHANGE, the more they stay the same
[4:35:29] <%Th3SmartAlec> @crimsonsaens Didn't the Global takeover not actually take away all the towns?
[4:35:32] <coldfire0007> It made a big dent
[4:35:34] <%jiggy_snipe> Woolie should have bought weapons after getting all that gold before
[4:35:36] <+dmtjinni> I have so many Channel Points
[4:35:37] <%Superdandy96> It’s amazing the bumble lording from everyone. It’s only Reggie who got the best of it
[4:35:38] <%emperordread> Oh ho? You're walking towards me? woolieREGGIEFUL
[4:35:39] <%purplehermit12> @Th3SmartAlec it took away every town.,
[4:35:40] <C4m3r0n0409> He was level 30 when he fought that fenrir
[4:35:40] <%viewtifulr> I have money on reggie to win
[4:35:41] <preppyposs> man fuck reggie, I hope Minh wins

[4:58:36] <heroicspiritavenger> @SuperFightinRobot Honestly, if the game didn't have way too much content, it wouldn't be as bad. The actual core gameplay isn't bad in small doses.

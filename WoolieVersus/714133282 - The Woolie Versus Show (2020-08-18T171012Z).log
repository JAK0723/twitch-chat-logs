[0:03:15] <DrkJP520> Is the mystery game Silent Hill 2?
[0:03:20] <prime_name> I keep forgetting Dreams is a thing
[0:03:26] <%Theycallmenerf> Also I just checked out Mortal Shell and that game has interesting tech
[0:03:33] <Triplicat> very cultured guess though sir I see you
[0:03:38] <+DukeBlack_> gwdHitIt gwdHitIt
[0:03:45] <%YakumoYomi> Chat, pls. The mystery game is obviously Raid Shadow Legends.

[0:58:53] <+Vardek13> As conceived in 1632 by Portuguese printing press operator Andre Felipe, boxing was a gentleman's game, in which two men would square off and regale each other with stories monotonous for days on end, until one of them fell to the ground from boredom or exhaustion. Over the next few years the new sport developed a respectable following of a few hundred local socialites.

[0:59:36] <+Vardek13> Ironically, it was Felipe's son, Andre Felipe Felipe, who developed what he called the “Punching” strategy, in 1637, after seeing a schoolboy strike another in anger, causing him to fall down. When Andre Felipe Felipe challenged the then-champion, British expatriate “Sleepless” Bill Bishop, to a match, Bishop was the odds-on favorite.

[1:01:06] <+Vardek13> The newcomers were enthralled to engage in these borderline-barbaric displays of human strength and skill, and the rest is history -- after a few spoilsport schoolmarms single-minded about safety added the padded gloves, of course.

[1:01:52] <penitentpentwitch> Now I want them to play Punchout
[1:01:53] <+Vardek13> Today's boxing enthusiasts fantasize about a newcomer that would rock the ring the way Felipe did. Calcification of the modern rule set has essentially locked the “Punching” strategy into place, but it's easy to get caught up in the fantasy. SourPls

[1:02:03] <%YakumoYomi> Thanks for the HyperCooldown @johnatdawn
[1:02:05] <+Vardek13> Young scholars with big dreams often enter the ring with their crazy new trick, usually a variant of hypnosis, and though they've achieved the occasional victory, none of the gimmicks have been robust enough to make it to the big time.

[2:30:12] <+Vardek13> When Andre Felipe Felipe challenged the then-champion, British expatriate “Sleepless” Bill Bishop, to a match, Bishop was the odds-on favorite. You can imagine his surprise when, while he was describing what he had had for breakfast that morning, Andre walked up and thumped him in the neck, sending him down “for the count,” in the parlance of our time.
[2:30:13] <%DensityD> which was the style at the time

[2:31:12] <+Juriasu> oh shit a bagel would be nice
[2:31:13] <+Vardek13> Today's boxing enthusiasts fantasize about a newcomer that would rock the ring the way Felipe did. Calcification of the modern rule set has essentially locked the “Punching” strategy into place, but it's easy to get caught up in the fantasy.

[2:31:27] <+Vardek13> Young scholars with big dreams often enter the ring with their crazy new trick, usually a variant of hypnosis, and though they've achieved the occasional victory, none of the gimmicks have been robust enough to make it to the big time.
[2:31:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> Reggie is about to fight his daughter.
[2:31:39] <%DensityD> do it reggie, reach out with your HEART
[2:31:45] <+Vardek13> The real wonder, though, is that Andre Felipe's original vision of boxing is still around! Gentleman's Boxing clubs can be found in cities all over the world. You can visit one most any day of the week and see two erudite gentlemen exchanging pleasantries in the ring.
[2:31:46] <%sssoapy> Don't worry Reggie you'll get it next time
[2:31:47] <%derap41> You've done the same stuff for years just reliving your past
[2:31:53] <christopherwpoindexter> wholesomeness isn't working....
[2:31:53] <%MayorRev> Scrambled eggs
[2:31:56] <+Vardek13> Most people only come to watch a few hours of a match and then leave, but every once in a while you'll find amongst your elders a stout fellow, a die-hard fan, who perhaps witnessed that historic battle between Felipe and Bishop, who for love of the sport must stay to witness the last glorious seconds of wakefulness slip away... only to return to fight again another day.

[2:32:40] <+rottingpastry> It's san francisco. Anywhere else would be cheaper
[2:32:40] <+Vardek13> As conceived in 1632 by Portuguese printing press operator Andre Felipe, boxing was a gentleman's game, in which two men would square off and regale each other with stories monotonous for days on end, until one of them fell to the ground from boredom or exhaustion. Over the next few years the new sport developed a respectable following of a few hundred local socialites.

[2:33:06] <+Vardek13> Ironically, it was Felipe's son, Andre Felipe Felipe, who developed what he called the “Punching” strategy, in 1637, after seeing a schoolboy strike another in anger, causing him to fall down. When Andre Felipe Felipe challenged the then-champion, British expatriate “Sleepless” Bill Bishop, to a match, Bishop was the odds-on favorite.

[2:40:04] <+Vorga1339> @blue6sub6remnant6 you gotta cascade into it or find a way to cast it without paying it's nonexistent cost, ofc

[3:31:13] <+sperbus> @WoolieVersus this epilogue takes a while if you planned to do something else
[3:31:18] <heartlesshealer> only 5 ladders
[3:31:24] <%chosenjuan42> ladders are limited
[3:31:36] <tonfirean> You need to go back up to make any progress, and you have a limited number of ladders.
[3:31:39] <bevyrage> right, reggie didn't learn from the first time around
[3:31:45] <heartlesshealer> reggie has no idea how to digdug
[3:31:45] <bevyrage> you HAVE to be able to get back to the top
[3:31:46] <%dekubaka> father we are drowning
[3:31:46] <%DensityD> Can you afford upgrade yet?
[3:31:46] <%derap41> Rock roll

[3:33:34] <%derap41> I've played enough terraria to know where this is going
[3:33:35] <@Solidus_113> he can't now
[3:33:36] <@Solidus_113> reset
[3:33:40] <heartlesshealer> Not enough ladders, Reggie failed
[3:33:42] <%DensityD> too greedy
[3:33:48] <TheLemuroid> Maybe he'll get deep enough for the next checkpoint
[3:33:50] <+Aztec50> this is gonna take a long time
[3:34:00] <%GeneralSCPatton> He committing too hard
[3:34:05] <heartlesshealer> door open

[3:35:25] <%DensityD> proceed upward as well, perhaps
[3:35:27] <%sparkly_yoyo> "I was out for five min, what did I miss" he asked, futilely
[3:35:40] <%koolaid_kevster> you can break small rocks with bristles harden

[3:36:59] <@Solidus_113> it can be really long if you don't know dig dug, and don't checkpoint often
[3:37:19] <%derap41> You can keep going back up for ladders

[4:18:51] <+Regigangster> It was a perfect execution for this game
[4:18:54] <%DensityD> !motivated
[4:18:54] <@Moobot> 1531 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[4:18:54] <+jiggy_snipe> maybe
[4:19:01] <heartlesshealer> hmm
[4:19:02] <skyheys> For the first stream itd be neat
[4:19:02] <%unclekulikov> i think it's worth finding out
[4:19:05] <gamewarden92> I want the mystery
[4:19:05] <%nxflre> reveal is better
[4:19:06] <BlackermanZX> i think thats just 50/50
[4:19:08] <DatAsuna> there's an appeal to both
[4:19:09] <%ozmon> Unfortunately, the answer's probably both
[4:19:24] <DedlokPM> That E3 tweet is basically a engagement bait tweet so they can actually get some engagement numbers so don't fall for it.
[4:19:25] <%Irridium> could also stop the spoiler talk that happens beforehand
[4:19:35] <%RadicalWeegee> Surprises are fun
[4:19:36] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:19:37] <+jiggy_snipe> that's true
[4:19:48] <+jiggy_snipe> your streams do start off as Just Chatting
[4:19:51] <DatAsuna> But also sometimes the game is the only reason they tune in too yeah
[4:19:54] <%RyTYoung> have I missed Paper Mario?
[4:20:05] <%doomerskeletor13> No
[4:20:05] <chll0ne> @rytyoung no
[4:20:11] <skyheys> Not telling also runs the risk of people going "OH, IT'S A BAD GAME THIS WEEK"
[4:20:12] <%doomerskeletor13> They played Frog Fractions
[4:20:12] <urkleturtle> the mystery reveal is better in people's head, but i bet posting which game is gonna be played is better for pulling in viewers
[4:20:14] <SomersaultJustice> so paper mario now?
[4:20:15] <%DensityD> BIG frog fractions stream
[4:20:20] <%RyTYoung> Ah cool
[4:20:28] <DedlokPM> @RyTYoung probably not doing it because they still have some frogs to fraction
[4:20:29] <%Javaa01> Yeah, and there's still like 40 minutes of game left after where you left off
[4:20:30] <ghoulishcripple> 8 dollar hat. 20 dollars of content
[4:20:39] <%ozmon> 16/4 hours of Frog Fractions
[4:20:41] <DatAsuna> hush was fun
[4:20:51] <%kyh9> Hush is good, it retains Batman's Detective origins
[4:20:52] <%Josef_Stryker> Hush is a solid pick.
[4:20:52] <skyheys> Hush is neat but *bad*
[4:20:58] <%Josef_Stryker> My personal fave Batman book is Court of Owls
[4:20:58] <%doomerskeletor13> It’s alright yeah
[4:21:04] <DatAsuna> I do have bones to pick with it, but spoilers
[4:21:06] <%doomerskeletor13> Court of Owls is good
[4:21:09] <%DensityD> is latest table lords up on the woolieVS youtube?
[4:21:18] <DatAsuna> isn't it just a special meal?
[4:21:20] <%Josef_Stryker> Scott Snyder's Batman run is amazing
[4:21:22] <%sparkly_yoyo> there was a tablelords?
[4:21:40] <%RadicalWeegee> @DatAsuna Its just a food , and a food you can make yourself
[4:22:06] <%WutangchickeN> smash controllers need to be a bar of soap
[4:22:11] <%WutangchickeN> there I did it
[4:22:40] <%doomerskeletor13> Grant Morrison Batman is basically Twin Peaks and Batman 66 thrown into a blender
[4:22:43] <skyheys> @josef_stryker Please go check out Denny O'Neil's batman
[4:23:02] <%AyotoCorp> I actually meant if you thought it was a good buy as a first fightstick for someone else
[4:23:04] <skyheys> He's extremely important to what the character is now
[4:23:05] <%DensityD> I think Fight Stick Graveyard is a Strong Name
[4:23:16] <%DensityD> Fighting Stick
[4:23:23] <ghoulishcripple> I know its cliche but there's something special to read a first edition run of The killing joke. it's so good it ruined the industry
[4:23:24] <%doomerskeletor13> Denny O’Neil died recently I think
[4:23:26] <@Solidus_113> calling anything a graveyard is a strong name
[4:23:35] <kasios> smfh
[4:23:39] <skyheys> @doomerskeletor13 Yeah. sucks.
[4:23:41] <%DensityD> "no, we refer to it as the G.Y. now"

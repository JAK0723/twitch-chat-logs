[0:21:03] <%GrassCannon> I mean, there are low lvl bgs
[0:21:06] <$Superdandy96> I always wanted to get into WOW, but I didn’t have the money or friends to play
[0:21:12] <+Loinclothiclese> you didnt know what a mmo was?
[0:21:20] <BlackermanZX> theres a lot of low lvl bgs in wow
[0:21:31] <%Asuterisuku> Grinding for grinding's sake is always a major turnoff. It's why I can't get into Monster Hunter.
[0:21:33] <nothuzad> guild wars is still one of the best pvp mmos
[0:21:36] <2017y> low level struggle brackets are the most woolieFUN
[0:21:46] <TheA1ternative> Rip Reggie missed out on being addicted to crack
[0:21:49] <%Bluwizard21> Guild wars 1 was so good
[0:22:04] <2017y> bizarre shit where rogues are better then druids before the level range when druids get everyone else's tools
[0:22:08] <jimmytwofeet> you got dat WMD? 20 bucks a pop
[0:22:12] <%YakumoYomi> DCUO was alright, in that regard: the "story" stuff from level 1 to 30 was fun. But after that, you had to start diving into the multiple currencies nonsense.

[0:00:11] <Tomas2886Cz> sbfpYeyeye
[0:00:11] <kylejefferies> First
[0:00:12] <%alrobot2014> since they did all that party prep at the end of last stream i think we'll have maybe 2 or 3 more streams, depending on if they also go back and watch missed content from dark side
[0:00:22] <%mighty_max_t> BIG KOTOR energy today!
[0:00:24] <TDAWS_MP132> I've been waiting for this for the last week
[0:00:45] <lotharrio> Well the extra stuff added by the restoration mod tends to drag a bit.
[0:00:45] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[0:00:47] <kylejefferies> I've been waiting for this moment since they started KoTOR 1.
[0:01:23] <DatAsuna> This is gonna be a long one
[0:01:54] <lotharrio> I'm trying to remember. He ended on Dantooine?
[0:01:58] <derap41> Oh now this is rocking
[0:02:06] <tiduidu> Yeah, he did the Council
[0:02:11] <+yaroslev_tartakovsky> I was waiting for the Dantooine scene since the beginning, but there are still a handful of big moments to come
[0:02:17] <tiduidu> Finally reading manga live, what up
[0:02:24] <prince_johnny_> LETS GOOO
[0:02:37] <%Chisas_Dead_Body> B E T R A Y A L

[0:02:49] <Dynamo_Commando> Huh, first time being on a live Woolie Stream. Nice
[0:02:53] <+krispen_wa> APATHY IS DEATH
[0:02:53] <%spiritofmojave> sbfpYeyeye
[0:02:57] <Shinyaron> Kotor time bois
[0:02:57] <lotharrio> They tend to do 4 hours and then another 2-3 after a break, right?
[0:03:09] <kylejefferies> APATHY IS DED
[0:03:09] <derap41> @lotharrio yeah pretty much
[0:03:11] <TDAWS_MP132> correct
[0:03:13] <%Chisas_Dead_Body> Yeah
[0:03:21] <Tayconk> The council is dead. Long live the Pack
[0:03:22] <MacHeath> Man day some fine ass fan art
[0:03:32] <kylejefferies> STREAM IS HYPE
[0:03:34] <$BallerSwagBro9k> KOTOR FINALE LETS GOOOOOO
[0:03:38] <tiduidu> The Jedi Pakk
[0:03:40] <memejima> At least old Vroomer is dead
[0:03:47] <+torusendor> I can't believe I'm finally caught up with the manga
[0:03:49] <%Chisas_Dead_Body> ATRIS GONNA GET IT
[0:03:50] <+krispen_wa> shitty HK factory section lets goooooo
[0:03:50] <blackskulldragon18> Vrook is gone
[0:03:56] <tiduidu> Oh fuck
[0:03:59] <%spiritofmojave> Vrook ((nothing))
[0:04:03] <tiduidu> They kept talking about HK factory
[0:04:04] <$BallerSwagBro9k> oh I forgot oof
[0:04:05] <Hopit> oh no
[0:04:06] <%alrobot2014> not even nothing
[0:04:06] <tiduidu> AND I KEEP FORGETTING
[0:04:10] <Hopit> not the factory
[0:04:10] <%alrobot2014> less than (nothing)
[0:04:11] <Hopit> oh no
[0:04:13] <memejima> Nothing(Nothing)
[0:04:16] <+CycloneEternalJoker> Time for the best part of the game
[0:04:19] <%spiritofmojave> oh god HK factory
[0:04:23] <%Chisas_Dead_Body> Vrook ()
[0:04:31] <Augus7717> Apathy is death?
[0:04:32] <+yaroslev_tartakovsky> I only found this bc of KOTOR 2. Had no idea who Woolie was before this but he's won me over
[0:04:32] <lotharrio> ...it feels like they could finish it tonight. But it'd be close. Most likely stop short unless they just say, "fuck it, we're finishing."
[0:04:34] <+krispen_wa> Nothing (Vrook)
[0:04:37] <%Lion_kun> Think they'll beat the game this session?
[0:04:53] <Hopit> no
[0:04:53] <kylejefferies> Nothing (Nothing) (Empty)
[0:05:01] <%Chisas_Dead_Body> They’ll get pretty close
[0:05:03] <derap41> yo 4th Columbus statue was just toppled
[0:05:04] <Goodvibes99508> @yaroslev_tartakovsky check out the super best friends stuff
[0:05:09] <+krispen_wa> they'll get to the final planet, but i don't think they'll finish
[0:05:11] <memejima> Get ready for the Echoes shot game y’all
[0:05:12] <%Chisas_Dead_Body> There are like 5 sections till the end
[0:05:24] <kylejefferies> @lion_kun Maybe, if they just jam through the last stuff pretty fast.
[0:05:28] <Shinyaron> they probably won't finish this session
[0:05:36] <grandark_z317> yeah, let's keep brutalizing our communities to combat police brutality, what's the worse that could happen?
[0:05:39] <derap41> This is some nice almost Daft Punk
[0:05:45] <Shinyaron> I'm sure after they finish V wants to do a big talk section
[0:05:47] <%Lion_kun> Getting close though
[0:05:47] <%samspam999> samspam999 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Got our food, got our drinks, lets go for the best thing on Twitch! Can't believe its been 3 months subbed already, thanks for all the laughs guys. Looking at doing future streams together? *cough* Fallen order or Mass effect!! Thanks again Sith Lords
[0:05:57] <lotharrio> Like I think they'll end up at the finale. But it'll be, "Okay, this is going to be at least two hours. What time is it?" "Man, I gotta get back home at some point." "Agreed. Calling it. Starting on Save. 1, 2, 3."
[0:06:01] <+slimmixrp> This song kinda slap
[0:06:01] <kylejefferies> but it would be a bit of a rush to finish this session, especially with restored content
[0:06:20] <Dynamo_Commando> Where are they supposed to go after Dantooine?
[0:06:20] <Divryne> APATHY IS DEATH.
[0:06:24] <+GiantPapaDoug> given how long the hk factory is by itself
[0:06:30] <+GiantPapaDoug> whooo booyy
[0:06:35] <kylejefferies> unless they just blitz it.
[0:06:51] <%Chisas_Dead_Body> Every time woolie goes: “sync test 1,2” my heart breaks
[0:06:52] <+GiantPapaDoug> yeau but seeing how woolie has played up until now
[0:06:57] <kylejefferies> i.e run from cutscene to cut scene.
[0:07:02] <Nested_Dreams> So the Manga is nearing the end?
[0:07:08] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @chisas_dead_body Same XD
[0:07:09] <+GiantPapaDoug> i got a feeling we're in for a ride
[0:07:16] <+GiantPapaDoug> could be wrong though
[0:07:22] <kylejefferies> @nested_dreams Safest bet is next session is last.
[0:07:23] <%Lion_kun> Anyone excited for the ps5 show. Im hopunf for eosome Elden Ring gameplay.
[0:07:29] <kylejefferies> or the session after that.
[0:07:36] <%dollarstored> dollarstored subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Penguin Kun Giragira wars check out the OST
[0:07:36] <mrkatmonarchy> whuddup everyone
[0:07:44] <$BallerSwagBro9k> I just want Dark Souls 4 T_T
[0:07:45] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:07:45] <Tayconk> I just hope the ps5 doesn’t sound like a jet engine
[0:07:50] <time_axis> Can't wait for the anime to catch up to last session. I really want to rewatch that council scene
[0:07:51] <kylejefferies> @lion_kun No mention of Elden Ring, but there was definite mention of the Gollum game.
[0:08:04] <MacHeath> anyone heard any rumours about what gen elden ring will be one
[0:08:13] <fearlesssavant12> I'm waiting for his reaction to the visas scene
[0:08:14] <MacHeath> they said initially ps4
[0:08:18] <fearlesssavant12> also the ending
[0:08:21] <kylejefferies> I've heard rumors of it being cross gen.
[0:08:23] <%Chisas_Dead_Body> Elden Ring only comes out after you die
[0:08:26] <%Wouldz> I assume just in time for the ps6
[0:08:27] <blackskulldragon18> do anyone hear a rumour that P4G is getting a PC port
[0:08:29] <lotharrio> @Nested_Dreams They have done all of the planets. Which means there's wrap up for some stuff, and then entering a lengthy final section. Roughly equivalent to KotOR 1's stuff with the beach planet onwards.
[0:08:31] <Shinyaron> it's probably gonna be cross gen
[0:08:31] <kylejefferies> @fearlesssavant12 No spoils.
[0:08:34] <MacHeath> and last year said stil ps4
[0:08:41] <%spiritofmojave> anyone else see that PS5 price point rumor on Amazon, cause oh lord LUL
[0:08:43] <tiduidu> So what RPG will Woolie delve into after KotOR
[0:08:54] <%Lion_kun> I hope Yaluza
[0:08:57] <tiduidu> I'm kinda hoping he'll keep craving Avellone and do New Vegas or whatever
[0:08:58] <%Wouldz> @spiritofmojave talk to me
[0:08:59] <blackskulldragon18> Mass Effect
[0:09:09] <%Lion_kun> Yakuza*
[0:09:14] <Doodle_Taco> yeyeye apathy stream
[0:09:15] <memejima> If they do Mass Effect, hopefully it’s also with V
[0:09:16] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Fallen Order
[0:09:18] <kylejefferies> my hope is Minecraft kappa
[0:09:27] <derap41> I still hope for Dragon Age OG that game doesn't get eniough love
[0:09:28] <kylejefferies> best rpg ever made.
[0:09:34] <+jake5713> Fuck yeah. KOTOR Wednesday are a really comforting constant during this virus.
[0:09:45] <kylejefferies> and the police brutality.
[0:09:46] <%spiritofmojave> @wouldz think Wario64 on Twitter posted a screencap of possibly $700 given the parts involved, just seemed not affordable
[0:09:53] <lotharrio> I imagine he won't jump into another one any time soon. A yakuza, Arkham or Spider-Man game would be fun. Part of what makes the KotOR 2 playthrough enjoyable is V's own opinions on the setting.
[0:09:54] <Shinyaron> Mass Effect pls. we need Captain Darlington Sheppard
[0:10:05] <+oda_flobunaga> just wait until he beats it today
[0:10:06] <blackskulldragon18> whatever they do I hope V join because they are cool
[0:10:13] <Nested_Dreams> @lotharrio Thx, am gonna stay for the intro and keep with the Anime since I know nothing about the last planet
[0:10:16] <kylejefferies> I live like 3 miles from where protests were happening and they were tear gassing empty streets.
[0:10:29] <huskarl_zap> final Betray
[0:10:44] <kylejefferies> Yeah, get V as the official Bard of Castle Super Beast.
[0:10:46] <%Wouldz> @spiritofmojave woof! That's groin grabbingly high
[0:10:47] <omegadarknes> can't wait for the stream to start, but i'm cool with listening to random music while looking at a bunch of fanart and contextless memes
[0:10:52] <tiduidu> Yeah, V's a great cohost
[0:10:55] <tiduidu> What a chill dude
[0:11:00] <lotharrio> @Nested_Dreams We're not at the last planet but... we're nearing the ending sequence.
[0:11:06] <%FuqBoiSlim> what's the name of this song
[0:11:13] <Dynamo_Commando> Imagine the podcast after this game.
[0:11:18] <%spiritofmojave> @wouldz as a not bougie, it's waaaaay too hard of a price yeah
[0:11:21] <Shinyaron> I'll be sad once Kotor ends if he doesn't do more with V
[0:11:31] <%Chisas_Dead_Body> I hope at some point in the future him and V go into New Vegas
[0:11:34] <TDAWS_MP132> it's a remix of a splatoon song, but I don't know the name @FuqBoiSlim
[0:11:41] <+GiantPapaDoug> i doubt he'd ever play it but i'd love to see woolie play divinity co op
[0:11:44] <derap41> With How terrible Twitch has been about copyrighted music I'm supriced Woolie has anythihng plalying
[0:11:46] <akman14> Mass Effect trilogy with V when?
[0:11:52] <%FuqBoiSlim> @tdaws_mp132 I knew it sounded familiar thanks
[0:11:55] <kylejefferies> Woolie Vs Witcher?
[0:11:56] <+oda_flobunaga> new vegas or vampire the masquerade
[0:11:57] <lotharrio> Again, the reason V was called in for this one is that he knows this game. He's not a general RPG expert.
[0:11:58] <Doodle_Taco> @Chisas_Dead_Body That would be super hype
[0:12:09] <TDAWS_MP132> np dude
[0:12:11] <Nested_Dreams> Hm, it is possible V might be up for The Last Order LP, right?
[0:12:17] <tiduidu> Yooo Vampire would be lit
[0:12:19] <%gatorafan> @derap41, Sajam apparently is fine as well, maybe video game music isn't real music after all? Kappa
[0:12:20] <tiduidu> It's pretty short too
[0:12:22] <kylejefferies> yeah but V is just cool.
[0:12:45] <lotharrio> True. But they addressed wanting him for New Vegas and Witcher before.
[0:12:48] <kylejefferies> Little V is like the cool uncle I never had because both my parents were only child's.
[0:12:52] <+oda_flobunaga> thronebreaker would be interesting to see
[0:13:11] <%lordranter> lordranter subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[0:13:22] <%gatorafan> Little V has been to Danube and lived to tell the tale, that's impressive.

[0:14:43] <mrkatmonarchy> @derap41 man, I hope it's OG Dragon Age, just to see Woolie conduct Elves Racism
[0:14:55] <+oda_flobunaga> What about Freelancer?
[0:14:55] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:15:06] <%Chisas_Dead_Body> Origins is the better Dragon Age tho
[0:15:33] <Kirbachev> Hang on, did Woolie legit do a DJ Prof K cosplay?
[0:15:37] <Kirbachev> I had no idea
[0:15:51] <Kirbachev> Fuckin' awesome
[0:16:04] <+oda_flobunaga> Or what about the Shadowrun RPGs?
[0:16:20] <%Ebonyglow> literally finished the last VOD just in time
[0:16:44] <derap41> @mrkatmonarchy an Elf Start would be very intresting
[0:16:59] <%Chisas_Dead_Body> !uptime
[0:16:59] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 17 minutes and 10 seconds
[0:17:07] <tiduidu> Shadowruns are not voiced, it would be a chore to read out
[0:17:09] <tiduidu> Sadly
[0:17:14] <+oda_flobunaga> true
[0:17:20] <kylejefferies> Chat, while we play, should I play FFXIV, Minecraft, FTL, or Risk of Rain 2?
[0:17:25] <akman14> Fuck, i would totally see Woolie playing the Shadowrun RPGs
[0:17:28] <+oda_flobunaga> sooo Baldur's gate 2 then?

[0:24:03] <surik_at> *drunk
[0:24:08] <+ntfth> Yoda's speech is accepting death, letting go of those you're afraid to lose.
[0:24:12] <+oda_flobunaga> A Bitch to be, How's it Feeeeeel Ani?
[0:24:15] <naoi0> "Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin! The fear of loss is a path to the Dark Side."
[0:24:16] <+VCRUZZO> this when he is in front of the council in one ?
[0:24:17] <+JustToWatch> Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to the darkside
[0:24:18] <heartlesshealer> Cut himself off from the Force because he was afraid
[0:24:20] <tiduidu> I won't do shots of alcohol cause I have none at my house aside from vodka
[0:24:23] <andrei11dr> Shit, i have nothing but 2 bottles of apple cider NotLikeThis
[0:24:23] <Kirbachev> "You are afraid of yourself, Exile. Of what you might do."
[0:24:25] <tiduidu> But coke shots count right
[0:24:25] <Doodle_Taco> Joda: Do not fear Kreia: Its cool dog
[0:24:32] <+evbites> Jedi:EW hormonal teens that we abducted
[0:24:39] <time_axis> episode 1 was... a blur
[0:24:39] <%FallenAngelZelos> fear leads to hate, hate leads to stress eating, stress eating leads to taco bell
[0:24:48] <EchoXOF> @tiduidu a line per echo sounds lit
[0:24:48] <+oda_flobunaga> in the council chamber
[0:24:49] <%Ashenik1> So Vrook was right not to feel The Force within the Exile
[0:24:52] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus when qui gon takes him to the council
[0:25:08] <%christopherwpoindexter> woolieLORE "i slaughtered them like animals..."
[0:25:13] <tiduidu> @EchoXOF lel. I might do lines of tobacco actually
[0:25:17] <grandark_z317> it's still better than "Rey Skywalker."

[0:25:34] <%FallenAngelZelos> @grandark_z317 ...is it tho???
[0:25:45] <+oda_flobunaga> "First Name" Noun-verber
[0:25:47] <+evbites> yoda is such a dick in the movies
[0:25:48] <grandark_z317> @fallenangelzelos yes
[0:25:52] <heartlesshealer> indoctrination
[0:25:52] <+Feralspirit41> Thinking about where disneys taking star wars is depressing me
[0:25:56] <%Lion_kun> What an awful line
[0:26:03] <+JustToWatch> The council senses you a bitch anakin
[0:26:04] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Jedis are dicks
[0:26:06] <%FallenAngelZelos> @grandark_z317 to each their own
[0:26:07] <Eger007> There's a small documentary called The foundations of Star Wars on youtube. it goes pretty interesting places.
[0:26:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> Anakin was the red headed step child.
[0:26:11] <+yaroslev_tartakovsky> chicken leads to egg, egg leads to omelette, omelette leads to fecal urgency
[0:26:22] <+oda_flobunaga> Yoda, more like Choda
[0:26:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> FEELINGS HURT WOOLIE
[0:26:25] <andrei11dr> Oh God, i always forget about the immaculate conception bullshit in episode I
[0:26:27] <+krispen_wa> ehhhh
[0:26:29] <+felrender> i mean, having an outlet for his emotions probably would have kept Anakin from confiding in the Cryptkeeper
[0:26:30] <+Feralspirit41> *the council sniffing when young anakin comes in* smells like bitch!
[0:26:35] <tiduidu> It's more about why Exile was the only survivor
[0:26:37] <e3a4> "How could someone turn away from such power? It was fear" Something like that?
[0:26:42] <tiduidu> Because they were afraid
[0:26:44] <+GiantPapaDoug> GiantPapaDoug subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:27:05] <heartlesshealer> Yeah, @e3a4
[0:27:13] <+oda_flobunaga> Jameson ftw

[0:27:17] <naoi0> Oh no

[0:27:20] <%FallenAngelZelos> what could go wrong?!

[0:27:21] <%MrRabbles> oh boy that one
[0:27:23] <DatAsuna> or their lightsbaers disappear

[0:27:26] <+Feralspirit41> Oh man
[0:27:26] <DatAsuna> or the wrong music plays
[0:27:27] <%spiritofmojave> It'll be INTERESTING
[0:27:27] <+SilverDevilfish> Fuck Droid Planet
[0:27:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> If it was not 10 in the morning I'd join you.
[0:27:29] <%Bluemanzee> I forgot :o
[0:27:29] <snakemuho> it's gonna be a planet and it's gonna have robots Kappa
[0:27:29] <naoi0> Seems like it
[0:27:31] <DatAsuna> or the wrong sound effects
[0:27:32] <Too_Much_Nukie> The Exile cut themselves off because of a primal instinctual fear. Not the same thing as Anakin's fear of loss.
[0:27:35] <heartlesshealer> oh dear
[0:27:35] <LeafarOz> ECHOES
[0:27:36] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Jedi vs Sith Is literally Religion vs Government Totalitarianism
[0:27:38] <andrei11dr> You should just run

[0:27:59] <$BallerSwagBro9k> And both are fucked up
[0:28:00] <aragaojunior> littlevmills <3
[0:28:00] <DatAsuna> There's one thing I have to tell you, but you're like 5 minutes too early to mention it
[0:28:15] <zocano> Yaaa there's one *big* thing missing that's deeply disappointing
[0:28:17] <DatAsuna> Hopefully V does and saves me the dollar though
[0:28:23] <%christopherwpoindexter> I won't leave u hanging @woolieversus -oh wait he's referring to Chris Avellone
[0:28:35] <+yaroslev_tartakovsky> Jedi Order vs Sith Empire maybe, sith philosophy is p wack but doesn't have to be governmentally backed
[0:28:39] <%Ashenik1> So after all guys, Vrook was right, the twist was the Jedi Council was correct not to act. I mean look at the Exile.
[0:28:42] <DatAsuna> that big thing was also something they were real curious about last week too
[0:28:47] <andrei11dr> Man, i would kill for a faithful remake of this game
[0:29:03] <$BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[0:29:04] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:29:05] <+oda_flobunaga> Mass Effect?
[0:29:06] <%spiritofmojave> NEW VEGAS? *cough fit*
[0:29:07] <Daskolin> MASS EFFECT :D
[0:29:07] <heartlesshealer> it's like having those two Tolkien wizards going off-continent to handle stuff to make the main story less horrible for the heroes -somehow- but forever left unexplained due to author existence failure
[0:29:08] <%MirriaElyssia> MASS??????!?
[0:29:09] <$BallerSwagBro9k> THAT GUY GETSBIT

[0:29:44] <+VCRUZZO> fo real
[0:29:48] <%FallenAngelZelos> Mass effect is the best when you play like wolverine
[0:29:48] <e3a4> I remember KoTOR 2 being a game that when you beat it the first time and dont do everything you can it can easily leave a bad taste in your mouth. But replaying it and learning all you can changes a lot of your negative opinion. Seeing Kreias back story for starters through dialogue.
[0:30:02] <lotharrio> Oh snap. I guess maybe Mass Effect IS in the cards.

[0:31:04] <zocano> I still love Beast Wars (and Machines, you cowards) but it's def still rough
[0:31:11] <lotharrio> Can't wait for some Starsies.
[0:31:14] <andrei11dr> Berserk 2016 though Kappa
[0:31:14] <heartlesshealer> Okay, that Penguin-kun music is actually really nice
[0:31:18] <+oda_flobunaga> Obsidian all the way
[0:31:21] <time_axis> they never do it right though
[0:31:23] <naoi0> Good luck, @OldManJEWc !
[0:31:24] <+MrMoonGoose> As someone who was there at the time, Reboot looked bad when it came out
[0:31:26] <Safarihat> zoids chaotic century looks sweet still
[0:31:27] <%Ashenik1> Beastar did it so well!!!
[0:31:31] <+wunp_fxs> 3d done right with 2d is incredible
[0:31:35] <$tallik44123> it also runs on like 12 fps
[0:31:38] <Doodle_Taco> Beastars looked amazing
[0:31:40] <akman14> Land of the lustrous is great and it is all 3d
[0:31:46] <snoburnaquarium> Land of the lustrous pulled it off really well
[0:31:50] <%FallenAngelZelos> beastars is great
[0:31:51] <+JustToWatch> it works great in Beastars, and I kinda dig Kengan Asura's style
[0:32:07] <zocano> My friends tried to get me into Kengan Asura, I dunno not feeling it
[0:32:14] <tiduidu> Vinland Saga did bits of CG really well too
[0:32:18] <tiduidu> Blended in pretty well
[0:32:22] <%OldManJEWc> Thanks, @naoi0 !
[0:32:28] <%therealtacopancakes> Dorohedoro is great except for the 3D at the beginning
[0:32:41] <%Ashenik1> Hobbit looked awfull!!!!
[0:32:44] <+oda_flobunaga> Or, start doing a tabletop rpg series?
[0:32:48] <heartlesshealer> Yeah, high framerates fuck with eyes and brains
[0:32:55] <time_axis> they can blend well if the animation isn't bad. In 2D, squashing and stretching and exaggeration is used to make that feel smooth, but in 3D people just get lazy and don't do that
[0:33:00] <akman14> Rise up
[0:33:05] <%christopherwpoindexter> Also it may be a justified fear of Disney's monopoly fucking over most everything 2D in the mainstream Western world and forcing 3D for everything?!
[0:33:06] <andrei11dr> I like how Gundam does the fights, at first the 3d looked kinda weird, but it got really good
[0:33:10] <naoi0> @oda_flobunaga Tablelords did a pretty good run of Dialect with Punchmom, Reggie and Minh
[0:33:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> Wait, is the first time we are gonna see Woolie drunk since Mortal Kombat Armageddon?
[0:33:21] <Second_Omega> @DorianCreed My dick can only be so hard dude
[0:33:27] <+oda_flobunaga> But D&D tho
[0:33:27] <+greatgetter> Fake 60fps is garbage
[0:33:28] <akman14> Also there exist interpolation programs that add frames to reach 60fps
[0:33:40] <Doodle_Taco> Yeah I agree
[0:33:51] <+greatgetter> Especially those awful 60fps anime clips are the worst
[0:33:54] <%CommanderSqueaks> NEVER turn on motion smoothing on your TV
[0:33:55] <Heyestus> Compositing has gotten significantly worse in the last 15 years it seems.
[0:34:04] <IvesNapalm> Fake 60 fps TVs are the worst, it looks so bizarre due to the fake frames the TV puts into it
[0:34:05] <Dynamo_Commando> nothing like the simuations
[0:34:15] <jamesthebrave> I really like the Garo anime seasons and Karas as far as CG in 2D in anime goes. Active Raid was pretty good for it too.
[0:34:28] <$BallerSwagBro9k> What do mean guns have recoil? LUL
[0:34:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> "The Coconut Effect"
[0:34:42] <%christopherwpoindexter> nani the fuck, indeed
[0:34:56] <ManlyMcBeefington> wasn't that podqusition episode last week?
[0:34:56] <+oda_flobunaga> the Princess Bride tho?
[0:34:56] <DatAsuna> just jump to avoid explosions lol
[0:35:03] <Second_Omega> A fight is scrappy and dirty even when its meant to be high level
[0:35:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> Horse steps do NOT sound like coconuts colliding
[0:35:12] <heartlesshealer> exaggeration for impact
[0:35:15] <DatAsuna> concussions don't exist in movies
[0:35:18] <naoi0> "This is nothing like the simulations, people are dying and there is a four armed light saber wielding cyborg with tuberculosis on the loose.

[0:36:58] <%Camail> as they calmly cough up blood
[0:37:02] <honeyman18> replace the guns with walkie talkies
[0:37:04] <%christopherwpoindexter> Trenches, tear gas, tanks...how the fuck would they die like that
[0:37:05] <jamesthebrave> Yeah I fight at a kickboxing/boxing gym and even sparring, with rules and shit can be a lot more scrappy looking than a movie
[0:37:06] <Doodle_Taco> That's what mustard gas does Kappa
[0:37:09] <Second_Omega> OOF
[0:37:11] <+wunp_fxs> oh hey, the game my company worked on
[0:37:16] <%FallenAngelZelos> saving private ryan is that movie that history teachers can't get enough of
[0:37:19] <DatAsuna> Also TRAIN PHYSICS
[0:37:30] <DatAsuna> Fuck operation cinder
[0:37:31] <Halospaz117> Wait it is?
[0:37:35] <+oda_flobunaga> the real one or the new one?
[0:37:35] <+MidnightBurst12> yep
[0:37:35] <+Feralspirit41> The campaign for battlefront two was alright
[0:37:37] <heartlesshealer> V now knows
[0:37:37] <naoi0> Shoot while the boms are dropping
[0:37:39] <%christopherwpoindexter> @datasuna ^
[0:37:41] <$BallerSwagBro9k> WHICH ONE?
[0:37:42] <akman14> Just like the simulations
[0:37:46] <$legacy0117> That is not accurate....lol. I'd show them Warhammer 40k.
[0:37:49] <Halospaz117> Like on origin?
[0:37:51] <%Malik1002> when you have notes
[0:37:53] <Shinyaron> was bf2 the one with the 501st
[0:38:00] <Second_Omega> Yeh but is it the 501st
[0:38:00] <Zebroneath> The campaign doesn't have much going for it.
[0:38:05] <naoi0> I love how tabletop WH40K has varying degrees of critical damage that lead to death
[0:38:06] <%Malik1002> I think there are some problems
[0:38:07] <Halospaz117> @Shinyaron OG BF2 is, yeah
[0:38:07] <+Feralspirit41> No the other bf2
[0:38:16] <Shinyaron> oh he means the bad bf2
[0:38:20] <+evbites> should have stayed with empire for story
[0:38:23] <+wunp_fxs> wait what?
[0:38:28] <+wunp_fxs> huh
[0:38:28] <+jiggy_snipe> lol

[0:38:39] <%FallenAngelZelos> haaaaaaaa
[0:38:42] <+krispen_wa> LUL
[0:38:44] <%christopherwpoindexter> huh, that's a wild Easter egg
[0:38:44] <%DesertPenguin> Which game is this?
[0:38:48] <+kewlmyc> What game is this?
[0:38:52] <Second_Omega> Ha thats not bad
[0:38:54] <Halospaz117> New Battlefront 2
[0:38:57] <%DesertPenguin> ooooo
[0:38:59] <+jiggy_snipe> Lando was drunk
[0:39:02] <andrei11dr> Free you say, hmmmmm
[0:39:02] <jamesthebrave> It is Lando's actor!
[0:39:06] <%DesertPenguin> gotta get that with my PS+
[0:39:06] <%FallenAngelZelos> so it's accurate
[0:39:07] <+Feralspirit41> Oh Billie D Williams
[0:39:07] <naoi0> Too bad the solo campaign for it is garbage
[0:39:07] <Zebroneath> Starwars Battlefront 2 EA is being discussed now
[0:39:10] <+evbites> it sucks
[0:39:10] <+oda_flobunaga> he was drunk on set of ep 9
[0:39:12] <Doodle_Taco> I CLAPPED
[0:39:13] <DatAsuna> and he has an AWFUL BEARD
[0:39:14] <%DesertPenguin> Didn't know it had a campaign
[0:39:15] <$legacy0117> Warhammer 40k covers every aspect of death possible.
[0:39:15] <%SilvaChariot0133> AT-STs!
[0:39:15] <%spiritofmojave> LUL
[0:39:16] <Djinnazz> Yeah that accurate

[0:40:08] <%christopherwpoindexter> @giantpapadoug i know, isn't it fuckin great when they give games the same name 🙃🙃🙃
[0:40:11] <e3a4> Rogue One/
[0:40:13] <$legacy0117> Yeahhhh....
[0:40:17] <tiduidu> What game are they talking about?
[0:40:20] <+evbites> i hate her rebel costume
[0:40:22] <Djinnazz> Yeah, the story is really dumb
[0:40:23] <+oda_flobunaga> wow sooo original
[0:40:24] <naoi0> Battlefront 2 I think?
[0:40:25] <Halospaz117> New Battlefront 2
[0:40:27] <@Moobot> Easy with the emojis @heartlesshealer

[0:40:41] <Second_Omega> I miss the 501st Logs
[0:40:43] <+VCRUZZO> alright, WE BACK, got liquor, and in V I trust! Bring us home...
[0:40:44] <%christopherwpoindexter> @tiduidu Battlefront 2, 2017
[0:40:48] <+oda_flobunaga> that does not sound like the BF2 campaign I know.
[0:40:52] <naoi0> This errily sounds like rogue one
[0:40:58] <heartlesshealer> But yeah, pointless quest
[0:40:59] <Ravingpyro> what.
[0:41:01] <%GiantPapaDoug> @christopherwpoindexter doesnt help that i was literally playing galactic conquest last night lmao
[0:41:06] <$BallerSwagBro9k> WAT
[0:41:07] <+VCRUZZO> OH damn it! this...
[0:41:07] <%christopherwpoindexter> 😒😒😒
[0:41:10] <$legacy0117> Although the reason for the Empire blowing up Alderan was because it had the most Rebel support.
[0:41:11] <+doc_ock_rokc> BF2 sucks
[0:41:16] <+evbites> the rebellion makes you dumb confirmed
[0:41:17] <Halospaz117> So wait is it free to keep, or temporary?
[0:41:25] <naoi0> Is Jedi Fallen Order good?
[0:41:25] <Djinnazz> Naw
[0:41:27] <%christopherwpoindexter> @giantpapadoug exactly
[0:41:29] <+VCRUZZO> that was bad
[0:41:33] <+oda_flobunaga> What about the Kyle Katarn games?
[0:41:33] <$legacy0117> Out of all the planets under Empire rule.
[0:41:34] <%blue2red> woolieMIRIN
[0:41:36] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @naoi0 is amazing
[0:41:36] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus tell him about operation cinder tho
[0:41:39] <+VCRUZZO> yeah
[0:41:42] <%Ghostbody> @naoi0 Fallen Order is good
[0:41:42] <TotallyJustBacon> multiplayer's great though
[0:41:43] <heartlesshealer> oh god, four minutes
[0:41:44] <%spiritofmojave> Very cool
[0:41:44] <ATPsoldat> @legacy0117 I thought it was because there was a senator in support of the rebellion there.
[0:41:45] <Djinnazz> @naoi0 yeah it’s great
[0:41:48] <+Reverend_Roscoe> what game?
[0:41:50] <%MrRabbles> almost exactly 4 20
[0:41:51] <%christopherwpoindexter> 😳😳😳
[0:41:52] <$BallerSwagBro9k> PLAY FALLEN ORDER PEOPLE
[0:41:54] <Second_Omega> Whelp. I'm gonna keep playing 2005 Battlefront and TF2
[0:42:00] <+oda_flobunaga> BB-H8
[0:42:03] <andrei11dr> But can you play as TR8-OR ?
[0:42:08] <+VCRUZZO> @Second_Omega second that
[0:42:12] <jamesthebrave> Oh fuck I need to see this
[0:42:13] <+doc_ock_rokc> @andrei11dr no
[0:42:15] <%mostly_simple> what's your take on the 501st campaign from BF2 on PS2?
[0:42:17] <+krispen_wa> The BB!
[0:42:19] <+ntfth> Hey Woolie, just wanted to share some trivia about Nomi Sunrider.. Her husband was a Jedi and she trained their daughter to be a Jedi. Banning marriage and relationships in the context of Kotor was super recent.
[0:42:23] <heartlesshealer> Okay the big BB sounds great
[0:42:33] <andrei11dr> Well then fuck it LUL
[0:42:36] <+Feralspirit41> Yakuza is awesome!
[0:42:38] <dead_harmony13> Yes woolie!
[0:42:41] <+Feralspirit41> Do big crime!
[0:42:43] <ATPsoldat> Yakuza 0 is fucking fantastic.
[0:42:45] <%SilvaChariot0133> THAT'S RAD!
[0:42:45] <+Reverend_Roscoe> what game were they talking about?
[0:42:46] <naoi0> Sounds like the ball from that Indian terminator movie or the hamster ball from overwatch
[0:42:47] <zocano> Not just a decent place to start: the *best* place to start
[0:42:49] <+oda_flobunaga> OOOOOH SHIT, that would be soooo cool.
[0:42:50] <$legacy0117> So, to strike fear on all of it's Citizens and make sure they wouldn't leave the Empire, is with Planetary exterminatus.
[0:42:55] <%spiritofmojave> Yakuza 0 is an amazing start and maybe the best in the series almost
[0:42:56] <dead_harmony13> It's really really good!
[0:42:56] <Undenizen> That's RAD
[0:42:58] <toffshelf55> Pat energy intensifies
[0:42:58] <Halospaz117> 0 is one of the few prequels i'd recommend to start with
[0:42:59] <Second_Omega> Wo BREAKING za LAW
[0:43:03] <+doc_ock_rokc> @WoolieVersus Yakuza Zero is so good that I almost don't want to suggest it as a starter because everything else is kinda lesser then that
[0:43:03] <%bread_assassin> You know what else is very very long? KOTOR 2.
[0:43:05] <Too_Much_Nukie> Woolie would love the Yakuza combat but I think the minigames would probably get on his nerves.
[0:43:05] <XxBigNerdxX> the side quests are the best part of the game
[0:43:06] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:43:07] <+Feralspirit41> Breaking za world!
[0:43:11] <%christopherwpoindexter> Good GTA-type games in general can be baller
[0:43:14] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Just play 0
[0:43:18] <Halospaz117> Fight forever
[0:43:18] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> yakuza 0 is shockingly good
[0:43:20] <$legacy0117> Warhammer 40K does this regularly in fact.
[0:43:22] <heartlesshealer> oof
[0:43:23] <Damie904> Hey Woolie, with Doom done and this being close(?) any hints about the next LPs?
[0:43:24] <+jiggy_snipe> oof
[0:43:24] <+Feralspirit41> oof
[0:43:27] <Second_Omega> Awww that sucks

[0:44:00] <Aye_Diddle_Dogs> Hey Woolz, I’ve been out of the gaming scene for a while due to work and have only recently gotten into Twitch. What’s worth playing these days? (aside from the familiar AAA titles). Thanks.
[0:44:02] <naoi0> Shakedownnn

[0:44:15] <naoi0> F
[0:44:18] <+HollowMan190> it's good dammit
[0:44:18] <DatAsuna> Shakedown's become a recurring pat meme
[0:44:21] <+oda_flobunaga> The Final Shakedown, ba da da dum ba da dum bum bum
[0:44:27] <+VCRUZZO> no
[0:44:28] <Vampyro241> LUL
[0:44:32] <andrei11dr> Majima is easily the best part of 0
[0:44:32] <TDAWS_MP132> no
[0:44:35] <%christopherwpoindexter> NOT EVEN
[0:44:36] <DatAsuna> No, they were actually half right about the hidden threat
[0:44:38] <Halospaz117> Nah they're just a bunch of dicks
[0:44:44] <Divryne> The Sith Lords are the Sith Lords we met along the way.
[0:44:47] <+VCRUZZO> they're just some assholes
[0:44:49] <+jiggy_snipe> guys the Jedi are dicks but the Sith are evil
[0:44:52] <heartlesshealer> BETRAYAL, but for reasons
[0:44:55] <Dynamo_Commando> sith's gonna sith
[0:44:55] <%MrRabbles> she's evil but she's spittin facts
[0:44:56] <+oda_flobunaga> Palpatine was behind it all
[0:45:02] <+evbites> fuck everyone
[0:45:02] <%FuqBoiSlim> JEDI BAD SITH GOOD HURR DURR
[0:45:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> Where's the Lie Woolie?
[0:45:07] <ingman112> Is she evil? Is she really?
[0:45:10] <naoi0> Time to go vs. hungry boi and angry boi
[0:45:11] <Second_Omega> @andrei11dr Majima's story is a 11/10 in this 10/10 game.
[0:45:12] <zocano> There is a non-zero chance you finish the game today
[0:45:16] <+yaroslev_tartakovsky> Kreia did not *want* to kill the Jedi Masters, as is revealed later-- I hope the guys discuss that
[0:45:17] <$legacy0117> YEP.
[0:45:22] <+felrender> yeah like the Sith in this are EXPLICITLY doing galatic genocide
[0:45:24] <Too_Much_Nukie> I'm glad Woolie is STARTING to appreciate his granny.
[0:45:25] <dereks0n> What a game where everybody's right but also wrong at the same time
[0:45:28] <+oda_flobunaga> frackin Reapers
[0:45:29] <$BallerSwagBro9k> DARTH SWAG
[0:45:31] <ingman112> No way do they finish today. Impossible
[0:45:35] <+oda_flobunaga> NONE
[0:45:36] <$BallerSwagBro9k> MY NEMESIS
[0:45:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> @yaroslev_tartakovsky Please don't spoil stuff that's coming up later.
[0:45:41] <bepno> hiya woolie, was wondering if you've ever considered playing through new vegas, it's a pretty decent rpg, pat had streamed it in the past, too
[0:45:41] <+VCRUZZO> none really
[0:45:42] <Second_Omega> There is no difference
[0:45:42] <naoi0> I hope they notice the boba fett reference in kreia's speech
[0:45:44] <DatAsuna> Unknown regions is still in the galaxy
[0:45:51] <DatAsuna> And galaxies are super super far apart
[0:45:52] <time_axis> I mean, if they were out of the galaxy, at some point they would have been in unknown regions too, so...?
[0:45:53] <DaikiWithDaShot> @dereks0n They're so right though. But they're soooo wrong though
[0:46:06] <+yaroslev_tartakovsky> Sowwy
[0:46:07] <+oda_flobunaga> Thrawn's nemesis
[0:46:11] <%CommanderSqueaks> Little V, is SWOTOR worth the trouble?
[0:46:12] <+Reverend_Roscoe> Canderous saw a yuuzhon vong scout ship
[0:46:12] <heartlesshealer> It's the same to people IN the star wars galaxy, but lore-wise it introduces Intergalactic Interaction
[0:46:12] <$legacy0117> Certain Sith groups are, Darth Crusty isn't.
[0:46:13] <SWAG_OG_0> are you guys not social distancing?
[0:46:14] <zocano> They are way closer to the end but it's easy to get hung up talking about stuff @ingman112
[0:46:24] <+evbites> do we want to hurt her?
[0:46:26] <DatAsuna> @time_axis the unknown regions don't go all the way around, it's basically only the northwest of the galaxy
[0:46:35] <+deviljhojho_> diet and exercise baby
[0:46:37] <+jiggy_snipe> it is manageable but damn that sucks
[0:46:42] <+WolfHavocX> doodWAT
[0:46:44] <+oda_flobunaga> Stevia extract
[0:46:45] <ValidVenasaur> stevia is good
[0:46:47] <naoi0> B E T R A Y A L
[0:46:50] <DaikiWithDaShot> Can we act like Kreia is 40 years younger and make her best girl
[0:46:53] <Mayachacha> I hate stevia
[0:46:55] <derap41> That one gives me the runs
[0:46:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> *sips Kickstart*
[0:47:02] <+spacehouse> Dehydrated Honey?
[0:47:03] <andrei11dr> Umm maybe some IVs ?
[0:47:04] <+krispen_wa> Stadia
[0:47:08] <Second_Omega> @DaikiWithDaShot Thats coward talk
[0:47:09] <%christopherwpoindexter> yes, medical advice part of the stream woolieLORE
[0:47:10] <zocano> Kreia is best girl regardless @DaikiWithDaShot
[0:47:12] <dereks0n> Isn't there basically a 2 Unknown 2 Regions that's even further in?
[0:47:13] <heartlesshealer> read all your food ingredients. Some products have surprises
[0:47:13] <+evbites> @DaikiWithDaShot coward
[0:47:22] <akman14> V is diabetic?
[0:47:24] <surik_at> You can't really go outside of the galaxy bc of giant barrier-like hyperspace anomaly around it
[0:47:41] <DaikiWithDaShot> I'm afraid of Granny's I'm sorry
[0:47:50] <%Lion_kun> Do you need insulin do type2?
[0:47:50] <zocano> True coward talk
[0:47:58] <Djinnazz> Yup
[0:48:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> Fat is your friend.
[0:48:04] <%DemonOfSalt> V is completely correct.
[0:48:04] <+krispen_wa> Just don't eat
[0:48:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> Fat is flavor
[0:48:06] <%DemonOfSalt> 100%
[0:48:07] <+wunp_fxs> so much surgar everywhere
[0:48:10] <zocano> also ya sugar is in literally fucking everything in America
[0:48:10] <%christopherwpoindexter> I KNOW
[0:48:10] <%spiritofmojave> sugar and sodium are oof
[0:48:14] <heartlesshealer> just eat eggs
[0:48:15] <%christopherwpoindexter> F to me
[0:48:16] <%Bluemanzee> :(
[0:48:17] <%groovediva> Oh good, I made it in time!
[0:48:17] <%eyezehuhh> eating fruit and yogurt atm
[0:48:18] <+evbites> sugar is in my soap
[0:48:20] <shadowboss89> Easy answer stop eating
[0:48:21] <$legacy0117> Not really, as long as Kriea stays a reasonable Sith/Gray....
[0:48:21] <Ravingpyro> F
[0:48:23] <%memequisition> so hard to just find like, jelly and jam that doesn't have boatloads of added sugar
[0:48:24] <derap41> Diet is 90% of exercise
[0:48:26] <Dynamo_Commando> too much sugar. only eggs can sustain me
[0:48:27] <%OldManJEWc> it's literally why I'm in the hospital right now lol
[0:48:28] <%Lion_kun> Sugar so good though

[0:53:34] <%FallenAngelZelos> no the internet needs to tell you how dumb, V
[0:53:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> I can't believe Woolie has a third heart guys.
[0:53:36] <%FuqBoiSlim> V isnt a fucking Wiki diver like a certain someone guys Kappa
[0:53:37] <Goban3> so im new and dumb, what are they going to do?
[0:53:37] <%DesertPenguin> Or aren't followers in general
[0:53:40] <dereks0n> Wait he has diabetes? Kappa
[0:53:40] <megamonmon123> @binary_fireball yes
[0:53:41] <toffshelf55> The hand signals are great but woolie should be clapping to emphasize the points
[0:53:43] <Tayconk> V spit that truth
[0:53:44] <zaitje> Woolie ate raw meat? Kappa
[0:53:44] <WanderingSwordsman> @woolieversus Just blame that One Guy
[0:53:50] <Space_Pagan> Can't believe V never player kotor before
[0:53:52] <%spiritofmojave> dumb for learning and being new to a thing 🥴
[0:53:56] <Tomas2886Cz> I didn't know that Woolie had diabetes, huh
[0:54:00] <%Binary_Fireball> that's horrible @megamonmon123
[0:54:00] <Halospaz117> I can't believe V gave Woolie diabetes to spoil the game for him
[0:54:04] <megamonmon123> little V is a fake star wars fan?
[0:54:04] <akman14> That never happens Kappa
[0:54:07] <%Chisas_Dead_Body> !uptime
[0:54:08] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 54 minutes and 19 seconds
[0:54:08] <%memequisition> Can't believe V doesn't know what Star Wars is
[0:54:09] <DatAsuna> The ads have great cinematography but the game's stuff sucks
[0:54:09] <megamonmon123> crazy
[0:54:14] <toffshelf55> Woolie got diabetes from all of those stolen pies
[0:54:15] <The_Nerd_Supreme> So woolie has five penises confirmed? /s

[0:54:24] <%spiritofmojave> Can't believe V gave Woolie diabetes
[0:54:32] <andrei11dr> I can't wait V gave Woolie herpes
[0:54:32] <derap41> like basic director stuff
[0:54:37] <DatAsuna> Why not have the good director direct the game as well?
[0:54:41] <megamonmon123> V gave woolie diabetes and stole his house?
[0:54:41] <+oda_flobunaga> The Sith Lords was truly the diabetes we got along the way
[0:54:43] <megamonmon123> wild
[0:54:43] <%FuqBoiSlim> cant believe woolie fed raw meat to V and V gave him diabetes as revenge
[0:54:46] <DatAsuna> cutscenes at least
[0:54:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> I can't believe Woolie has the black lung.

[0:57:03] <naoi0> KOTOR 2 is way better than the first @Goban3
[0:57:06] <+VCRUZZO> fair enough
[0:57:06] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1270228062764969985
[0:57:10] <megamonmon123> boogaloo is actually a reference to civil war now
[0:57:15] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Kotor 2 is better in most ways
[0:57:15] <megamonmon123> apparently
[0:57:17] <+sirisvirus> I completely get the feeling of making a joke and needing to personally apologize cause you feel bad about it.
[0:57:17] <%Wouldz> stop making me like you V
[0:57:21] <+oda_flobunaga> Watch some Frankie Boyle clips
[0:57:24] <+sirisvirus> completely reasonable

[0:57:44] <derap41> Don't need to pile it on you are forgiven
[0:57:48] <andrei11dr> Jokes are like doing electrics in Tekken, sometimes they just don't come out good
[0:57:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> R Kelly gets in on that ALPHA
[0:57:53] <%Ashenik1> What did V say????
[0:57:53] <dereks0n> Darth Kel'Y

[0:58:40] <Space_Pagan> yeyeyeyeye
[0:58:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> Frankenfurter
[0:58:41] <time_axis> antisterbation
[0:58:41] <%spiritofmojave> STEP ON VROOK
[0:58:42] <Second_Omega> The nothing (nothing)
[0:58:42] <snakemuho> teabag him
[0:58:44] <Sapphire_Breeze> REMAINS
[0:58:45] <%christopherwpoindexter> woolie has thots woolieGASM woolieGASM
[0:58:47] <Halospaz117> Was Fann standing over the corpses for a week?
[0:58:55] <Djinnazz> She destroyed them in an INSTANT!
[0:58:56] <Dynamo_Commando> Vrook:Nothing
[0:58:56] <Halospaz117> VROOK (NOTHING)
[0:58:56] <Space_Pagan> RIP IN PISS VROOK
[0:58:58] <%Chisas_Dead_Body> VROOK ( )
[0:58:58] <%christopherwpoindexter> all the hype
[0:58:59] <%mostly_simple> no ghost 4 U!!!
[0:58:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> Kreia did NOTHING WRONG
[0:59:01] <%spiritofmojave> I'd condone that, hey
[0:59:01] <olaksi> One of the best monologues in a game
[0:59:03] <naoi0> "It doesn't matter how often you think of doing bad things so long as you don't do them because it would make you feel bad." - Pat
[0:59:06] <%Ashenik1> VROOK WAS RIGHT
[0:59:07] <%GeneralSCPatton> Look at all these sanctimonious assholes who don't have souls anymore.
[0:59:13] <Kirbachev> vrook was the absolute worst. I'm convinced Bioware built the character of the Turian council member off him in ME1.
[0:59:14] <naoi0> Force succed
[0:59:15] <Halospaz117> SHE EVIL BUT IT'S RAD THO
[0:59:15] <%FallenAngelZelos> but it's frickin cool as f*ck!!
[0:59:15] <+oda_flobunaga> Eh?
[0:59:18] <+evbites> she"s hot so she"s morally grey
[0:59:19] <%christopherwpoindexter> I AGREE, I UNDERSTAND UR HYPE GUYS
[0:59:19] <Second_Omega> Kreia Did the HYPEST SHIT
[0:59:19] <snakemuho> good people can be idiots
[0:59:21] <+jiggy_snipe> they are just very flawed
[0:59:21] <derap41> They're not wrong they're just assholes
[0:59:23] <+theaceclaw> THE FORCE SHALL SET ME FREE
[0:59:26] <+BubbaRands> *pours wine* not gonna lie, she got a point
[0:59:33] <Halospaz117> They're good guys, they're just dumb assholes
[0:59:35] <dereks0n> They're also SUPER RIGHT to be worried about the walking force void who suck life out of everyone they interact with
[0:59:36] <naoi0> "When the villain lowkey is making a lot of sense"
[0:59:40] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> I think Kriea was in the right to kill them in this ONE instance
[0:59:42] <+BlockingDisabled> Jedi are 'good guys' but they're still not 'right'
[0:59:46] <Ravenian96> Kreia was simply defending you from Jedi assault, perfectly legal to succ the life to defend your student
[0:59:46] <+oda_flobunaga> She's a Great Grandma, from that WKYK sketch
[0:59:48] <IvesNapalm> Kreia did nothing wrong, she just cut them off from the force like what they were going to do to the exile
[0:59:50] <megaman_sentinel> my chain r broken
[0:59:56] <Sapphire_Breeze> HELL YEAH
[0:59:57] <%spiritofmojave> HELL YEAH KREIA
[0:59:58] <olaksi> Jedi are Democrats, Sith are Republicans
[0:59:58] <SunjammerIV> when she murdered the council kreia was doing self-defense on your behalf, literally did nothing wrong
[0:59:59] <brachydios777> How long the stream been going?
[0:59:59] <snakemuho> POP THE MIC
[1:00:00] <tuesti> LMAO
[1:00:01] <%christopherwpoindexter> THAT'S THE POINT OF THIS GAME
[1:00:02] <tiduidu> Granny did nothing wrong
[1:00:02] <DatAsuna> The backdown
[1:00:02] <Kirbachev> @BubbaRands I mean, she's right. It's more nuanced version of The Incredibles.
[1:00:03] <Shade075> But Sith are COOL THO
[1:00:07] <anita_dickin> GRIFFITH DID NOTHING WRONG
[1:00:08] <Second_Omega> YO KREIRA
[1:00:12] <Too_Much_Nukie> But Kreia isn't properly dark side.
[1:00:13] <+evbites> You did bad but i am proud
[1:00:19] <Doodle_Taco> I think the important part was that she gave them a chance, but they were going to fuck it up
[1:00:20] <+VCRUZZO> @anita_dickin ...
[1:00:20] <andrei11dr> You know what's great about this LP? It's that know im going to just have it in the background as i turn to my monitor to get mauled in Darkest Dungeon LUL
[1:00:20] <ColbyBryant> Red lightsabers tho
[1:00:21] <naoi0> Kreia pushing the exile to kill the brother on that planet
[1:00:25] <DaikiWithDaShot> Jedi are more fun to make fun of cause they're hypocritical
[1:00:25] <+Ancopro> she is the real force unleashed
[1:00:26] <Space_Pagan> Granny fucks shit up!
[1:00:29] <+JustToWatch> Woolie: "Kreia, much like Griffith, did nothing wrong"
[1:00:30] <memejima> Love or Hate her, she WAS spittin’ facts
[1:00:36] <Too_Much_Nukie> Kreia taught you about this guys. The true dark side is just an uncontrolled beast. Wanton slaughter.
[1:00:36] <+jiggy_snipe> what Kreia did right here was fine cuz she saved Fann from a pretty dire fate
[1:00:37] <%mostly_simple> griffith lmao
[1:00:40] <tuesti> mmmmmmmmmm
[1:00:41] <zocano> The dark side variant of this meeting is just as interesting but you miss the amazing back to back and "You saw"
[1:00:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> You were right, but you took it a LITTLE too far.
[1:00:44] <dereks0n> A Dave Chappelle scream is in order for that moment
[1:00:45] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Haha yeah.....i didn't kill Vrook either......hahahaa
[1:00:46] <DaikiWithDaShot> The sith are too easy to argue against, so it's more interesting deconstructing Jedi ideas
[1:00:50] <+JustToWatch> fuck
[1:00:50] <Kirbachev> @Too_Much_Nukie She's grey, just in a different way to Jolee. Jolee was passively grey, she's actively so.
[1:00:50] <KaiserMario> Hmm... Not sure being the bigger man always works...
[1:00:58] <%Zohare> Granny took her hood off so I do condone it
[1:01:03] <SunjammerIV> the council was forcibly assaulting you, kreia stepped in and saved her friend, LITERALLY NOTHING WRONG
[1:01:05] <%christopherwpoindexter> JUSTIFIABLE evil 😏😏😏😏😏😏
[1:01:08] <Too_Much_Nukie> @Kirbachev She's definitely not grey.
[1:01:09] <+evbites> kreia saved the universe technically cause without you hungry boi wins
[1:01:10] <ingman112> There should be a body in the side rooms by the way
[1:01:12] <naoi0> Lawful evil
[1:01:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> Okay, okay real talk? Vrook can go. Like, Vrook in that moment is NOT a good guy. If Kreia JUST killed VROOK, then I couldn't even call her evil.
[1:01:22] <Second_Omega> Apathy is Death.
[1:01:25] <naoi0> GO-TO did nothing wrong
[1:01:32] <Shade075> Self defence! She was protecting you
[1:01:35] <DaikiWithDaShot> Vrook should be considered a dark Jedi if anything
[1:01:38] <%christopherwpoindexter> same
[1:01:39] <SunjammerIV> JEDI ARE COPS
[1:01:39] <megaman_sentinel> yes lawful evil
[1:01:40] <%GeneralSCPatton> First playthrough is the OMNI-GIG
[1:01:51] <%FuqBoiSlim> AJAB
[1:01:53] <Second_Omega> What do you MEAN we're not getting a second 90 Hour SecondGIG
[1:01:55] <Doodle_Taco> Vrook an those chucklefucks would have legit destroyed the galaxy
[1:01:56] <+evbites> Why
[1:01:57] <%christopherwpoindexter> OMFG THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE PARTS
[1:02:02] <Kirbachev> @Too_Much_Nukie She's seen all sides of the Force, andsaying more would spoil things. But she's either grey, or nothing.
[1:02:04] <naoi0> OHBOY
[1:02:05] <Too_Much_Nukie> EVERYTHING IS LIES
[1:02:14] <+evbites> damn
[1:02:21] <naoi0> Stock Fann'y face
[1:02:22] <Space_Pagan> BETRAYAL
[1:02:24] <%christopherwpoindexter> so fucking happy to be here again
[1:02:26] <%spiritofmojave> BETRAYAL
[1:02:31] <%FallenAngelZelos> game is about to pop off
[1:02:39] <akman14> Wait, what if you don't bring the handmaiden?
[1:02:49] <Too_Much_Nukie> @Kirbachev Trust me I know. I've beaten this game with every kind of playthrough you can think of. But Kreia isn't grey because she's not actually neutral. She's not between the light and the dark, she's her own thing.
[1:02:50] <%bread_assassin> How does this play out if you have Disciple? Does he also have access to Telos?
[1:02:50] <Djinnazz> drink

[1:03:22] <+eanscrale> Dis gonna be gud
[1:03:22] <Kirbachev> @Too_Much_Nukie Fair point, grey would presume she upholds it. A force nihilist?
[1:03:25] <+doc_ock_rokc> V and Woolie confirmed dead from alcohol poisoning
[1:03:25] <Explodincatz> rip
[1:03:26] <Halospaz117> LP cancelled due to death

[1:03:31] <%MaSterChiEfin420blntNinjA> But... it's only like 1. I have things to do
[1:03:31] <memejima> ECHOES: Act 4: Dead Liver
[1:03:31] <%DavidDredd84> I DON'T DRINK BUT I GOT WEED woolieSHOOK
[1:03:34] <naoi0> Cheers mates
[1:03:35] <Too_Much_Nukie> @Kirbachev Yeah definitely. Kreia is a nihilist.
[1:03:35] <PunkZedB> alcohol poisining is a quick and insidious killer
[1:03:37] <%christopherwpoindexter> SPEAKING OF DEATH
[1:03:38] <+VCRUZZO> @christopherwpoindexter you ain't the only one. This has been a fun ride all over again

[1:03:45] <Rymbler> 2nd session will be hard on them
[1:03:47] <ingman112> Ask it anyway

[1:03:56] <%christopherwpoindexter> @vcruzzo woolieCHAN 🤗
[1:04:02] <+jiggy_snipe> the force works in mysterious ways
[1:04:03] <Halospaz117> No, shh, the force told him

[1:04:38] <+jiggy_snipe> of course not you idiot
[1:04:40] <corwinner> Its probably obvious but here is my take on Apathy is death. Apathy = I dont care => do nothing. If you are doing nothing you my as well not exist.
[1:04:41] <Too_Much_Nukie> IS IT THOUGH?

[1:08:21] <naoi0> @PunkZedB Dickhack
[1:08:24] <jamesthebrave> Woolie "Love is just chemicals" at it again
[1:08:26] <%GeneralSCPatton> DO YOU BELIEVE IN YOUR NAKAMA?
[1:08:26] <Too_Much_Nukie> That's why this game is so fucking good!
[1:08:28] <dereks0n> Are you implying Force Have Sex WIth Me is the case?
[1:08:32] <KaiserMario> @MrMoonGoose Are you saying they're all homo Sapiens Sapiens despite being aliens?
[1:08:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> @jamesthebrave This is the JoJo LP all over again
[1:08:38] <snakemuho> talking all that without hitting 1 is the epitome of this entire podcast LUL
[1:08:42] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus descartes?
[1:08:49] <%JohnAtDawn> You are seriously overstating the influence.
[1:09:16] <Doodle_Taco> Well she started the conversation saying that its that feeling she values
[1:09:18] <heartlesshealer> And also she's a miraluka
[1:09:22] <+jiggy_snipe> maybe you're just likeable and personable guy
[1:09:30] <+MrMoonGoose> @kaisermario I'm saying a human from another planet is still a human, while a non-human from earth is still an earthling

[1:21:43] <Joestar1890> @heartlesshealer Who are you who knows much of the ways of Science?
[1:21:44] <blackskulldragon18> TIME TO KO AND PUNCH THAT GIRL
[1:21:45] <%GiantPapaDoug> it's actually not too terrible
[1:21:47] <%therealtacopancakes> wooliePOYO
[1:21:47] <tolloponik> that stun gyn
[1:21:48] <muniea3> she got force bzzt?
[1:21:50] <tolloponik> gun
[1:21:50] <$legacy0117> Yeah, you can do this with all encounters, but it is only explained here.
[1:21:51] <%spiritofmojave> gotta Black Knight them into just a torso and head
[1:21:51] <jamesthebrave> Concussion grenades
[1:21:51] <subjectg> in vanilla this just hard cuts to the next segment
[1:21:56] <stevenellis386> we're gonna have to force push our way of this one
[1:22:01] <grandark_z317> Why are we trying to spare them?
[1:22:02] <%christopherwpoindexter> Exchange negotiator
[1:22:02] <%GiantPapaDoug> super easy to get their hp low without killing them
[1:22:03] <BliVru> @WoolieVersus You should SAVE as soon as you get control
[1:22:13] <heartlesshealer> I am but a man who has eyes
[1:22:14] <Damie904> What is this, if she doesn't sink she's a witch shit?
[1:22:16] <grandark_z317> they're fucking insane and want to murder Handmaiden
[1:22:19] <Dynamo_Commando> gotta pull a Kenobi here and severe all limbs.
[1:22:24] <%GiantPapaDoug> @grandark_z317 light side endings etc.
[1:22:28] <blackskulldragon18> Save and punch
[1:22:31] <%christopherwpoindexter> check ur inventory for stun weapons like the Gand shit
[1:22:38] <grandark_z317> @giantpapadoug ugh
[1:22:40] <grandark_z317> of course
[1:22:49] <%GiantPapaDoug> but also they arent insane
[1:22:50] <Joestar1890> @Damie904 It's reference to Monty Python and the Holy Grail
[1:22:54] <Too_Much_Nukie> It is
[1:22:55] <stevenellis386> "Gotta kill 'em just to save 'em🎶"
[1:22:55] <dereks0n> Once someone gives into the Dark Side, it's basically all in at that point
[1:22:55] <%GiantPapaDoug> just being manipulated
[1:22:56] <+VCRUZZO> it is
[1:22:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> Kreia just went "You know you're evil right?" and Artrias went "Oh fuck, you're totally right."
[1:23:00] <+MidnightBurst12> yep
[1:23:00] <%hzflank> I think that she has an passive stun on her unarmed attacks (echani Strike)
[1:23:04] <%GiantPapaDoug> they dont know what'a going on
[1:23:05] <XxBigNerdxX> doesn't play out at all
[1:23:06] <$legacy0117> YEP.
[1:23:14] <Halospaz117> I think w/o restored content it's actually a fade to black, no player combat
[1:23:14] <+VCRUZZO> otherwise no combat happens here
[1:23:22] <sadbarbarian> sadbarbarian subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:23:27] <%christopherwpoindexter> It would be interesting if the whole game fleshed out this *pacifist* option
[1:23:28] <XxBigNerdxX> they just fall over on a black screen
[1:23:31] <+VCRUZZO> @Halospaz117 right
[1:23:34] <%GiantPapaDoug> yeah restored content lets you do the encounter
[1:23:34] <ingman112> Keep in mind Atris is an unreasonable fanatic
[1:23:36] <%haisho> It is a quiet thing, to let it set in.
[1:23:39] <%christopherwpoindexter> 15 and a half years
[1:23:41] <ingman112> Whether Jedi or sith
[1:23:48] <Too_Much_Nukie> Atris fell a long time ago. She just refused to admit it.
[1:23:52] <olaksi> Peace through superior punching power
[1:23:53] <dinnydanny777> It's almost like she's a fallen jedi
[1:23:58] <Dynamo_Commando> @commandersqueaks Atris: Are we the baddies?
[1:23:59] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Atris fell a LONG time ago
[1:24:02] <+jiggy_snipe> I think it only works like that for weak minds maybe
[1:24:06] <+krispen_wa> She was always a dark jedi. this is just her breaking poimt
[1:24:06] <Joestar1890> Man, Anakin's fall in Clone Wars is so good
[1:24:08] <naoi0> Sith holocronsss.
[1:24:09] <%christopherwpoindexter> not just this encounter, but like EVERYTHING, EVERY ENCOUNTER in the game has options like this
[1:24:10] <ingman112> It’s perfectly in character for her to HARDCORE stick to the rules and regulations of her philosophy
[1:24:23] <$GabeSweetMan> Pacifist or Genocide Route? We Undertale now.
[1:24:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yes
[1:24:33] <+jiggy_snipe> she needs to fight her shadow Kappa
[1:24:34] <%GiantPapaDoug> well yeah the restored content adds lines, encounters, modifiers to encounters etc
[1:24:41] <naoi0> "What have I done?!" "RISEEE"
[1:24:47] <%ChoculaUltra> Captain Crunch's Oops! All Evil
[1:24:47] <+MidnightBurst12> she kind of already saw the handmaidens as tools as well
[1:24:49] <dereks0n> I used that stones to destroy the stones
[1:24:51] <dinnydanny777> "I'm killing the babies to save the city, I'm a good guy I swear"
[1:24:51] <DatAsuna> warcraft spoilers
[1:24:53] <%GiantPapaDoug> a whole section coming up is restored content
[1:25:00] <%GiantPapaDoug> but i wont spoil that ;)
[1:25:01] <dereks0n> Absolutely, once it has a hold it takes over
[1:25:03] <time_axis> she might have been thinking that way all along but just holding back
[1:25:03] <%Zohare> Atris did send all the jedi to Katarr to die but run away herself
[1:25:07] <%christopherwpoindexter> Or, it would be interesting IF the whole game had stuff like this
[1:25:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> She was dark side for A LONG time. Kreia just removed Artrias Self Delusion.
[1:25:12] <heartlesshealer> Oh yeah, that's right. She didn't see the handmaidens as people
[1:25:12] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:25:19] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus tell him about the atris traya thing, it explains it a lot but isn't restored
[1:25:25] <+jiggy_snipe> was she going through the 5 stages?
[1:25:26] <+doc_ock_rokc> @WoolieVersus She is still in denial about it she wants the handmaiden to kill so she can be justified
[1:25:37] <Halospaz117> It probably started the moment the Exile left for war
[1:25:52] <subjectg> @datasuna maybe he’s waiting till the final, final thing for it to make sense
[1:25:52] <blackskulldragon18> She denied it as hard as Her Undying love/Hate for the Exile
[1:25:59] <Doodle_Taco> She was so angry to cloud all the dark side
[1:25:59] <naoi0> Atris wish she had the guts to join the exile
[1:26:00] <endarren> If you cheated and had Force Vision when you meet Atris, you will see she is Dark Side red
[1:26:15] <dinnydanny777> "You know we could save a pandemic by shooting everyone who catches the disease" type logic
[1:26:23] <%christopherwpoindexter> @endarren oh my god she is...fuck that's wildin
[1:26:25] <grandark_z317> BUSTAH WAVE
[1:26:26] <+krispen_wa> Forcr (Nothing)

[1:26:30] <grandark_z317> ENERGY WAVE
[1:26:32] <%christopherwpoindexter> NOISE
[1:26:41] <%Zohare> I think Handmaiden might have bad wisdom from her mask
[1:26:45] <XxBigNerdxX> he has on the force shield helmet it won't work
[1:26:48] <%christopherwpoindexter> !!!VOLUME WARNING!!!
[1:26:50] <heartlesshealer> Stun grenades?
[1:27:00] <%alrobot2014> the shield didn't activate?
[1:27:11] <dereks0n> Meanwhile you and Visas are getting it on
[1:27:17] <%GiantPapaDoug> yeah if they took off the mask they'd have a better chance with force wave
[1:27:17] <+SinisterBroccoli> it did activate
[1:27:20] <+jjjkopf> this fight suckssssss
[1:27:20] <%alrobot2014> oh wow
[1:27:21] <ingman112> Shield didn’t proc
[1:27:30] <+SinisterBroccoli> There was an arrow on the portrait
[1:27:35] <dinnydanny777> Yo did you see that Handmaiden leaping like that
[1:27:36] <+SinisterBroccoli> so shield work
[1:27:40] <naoi0> KOTOR 2 makes it so easy to murder Kappa
[1:27:42] <Halospaz117> u ded
[1:27:43] <ralphfromdk> Oh you are so dead :o
[1:27:43] <dinnydanny777> That was some anime shit right there
[1:27:44] <dereks0n> Save just in case you have to reload?
[1:27:44] <+RJay80> det
[1:27:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> Cheer500 How I took it is that Atris has been dark side for a LONG time (if you Force Vision her when you first visit, she's SUPER red). What Kreia did was peel away Atris' self-delusion along with some good old fashion Force mind-fuckery. Artris has been at the edge of the cliff for a LONG time, Kreia just gave her a tiny push.
[1:27:46] <%DorianCreed> Oh wow you got melted
[1:28:04] <naoi0> uh oh
[1:28:05] <lotharrio> Do drugs, too?
[1:28:05] <ralphfromdk> Pop some drugs for buffs?
[1:28:07] <+krispen_wa> Atris is Harvet Dent in TDK
[1:28:28] <%Ashenik1> @CommanderSqueaks all it takes is a little push HEahahahahah

[1:30:13] <%christopherwpoindexter> Ok I love this game, and maybe it's my fault for having the easiest settings no matter what game I play, I don't want to just say Dark Souls because of some IGNorant journalist, but this game is too easy...I think it helped they have difficulty on Normal instead of Easy right now, so this is actually an interesting challenge for them

[1:32:20] <%JaceDarkstar> *drinks v's liquor *
[1:32:24] <dinnydanny777> She's absolutely the villain in everyone else's story tho
[1:32:25] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus It's to do with cut content partially, content that wasn't restored
[1:32:30] <lotharrio> Atris never gave a real shit about the Handmaidens.
[1:32:33] <Kirbachev> "The means justifies the end"
[1:32:33] <time_axis> She was already way far gone, I think.
[1:32:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> She was meditating in a BRIGHT RED ROOM
[1:32:41] <+MidnightBurst12> She already sacrificed a bunch of jedi
[1:32:42] <shutupandjam3465> No its a long time coming woolie youll see
[1:32:42] <dinnydanny777> Kill the babies to save the city
[1:32:47] <+jiggy_snipe> she was always evil, didn't care about the handmaidens, just lied to herself
[1:32:50] <Lancaster_H> dude she fell years ago she's just in denial @WoolieVersus
[1:32:51] <Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus to be fasir, you dont get a lot of indication she cares much about The Handmaidens to begin with
[1:32:52] <shutupandjam3465> youll see woolie just wait
[1:32:53] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> They did give you evidence
[1:32:53] <+jiggy_snipe> she was angry at you
[1:32:55] <%christopherwpoindexter> There was a reason we talked shit on her from the start
[1:32:56] <%FallenAngelZelos> that's pretty fair
[1:32:56] <ingman112> Atris is also totally losing it. She’s not exactly rational
[1:32:57] <+krispen_wa> Did you not listen to her?
[1:32:58] <%hzflank> woolie...wait
[1:32:59] <DatAsuna> Only most of the stuff was restored but a lot was still left out and only found in datamining
[1:33:05] <$TheFabledAble> @WoolieVersus Kreia has been hinting at it A LOT
[1:33:07] <naoi0> Atris cuddling the exile's lightsbaer
[1:33:07] <phatmac16> That’s fair woolie
[1:33:07] <+Reverend_Roscoe> woolie...
[1:33:09] <lotharrio> Remember when she sent Handmaiden to you, and then told her sisters that Handmaiden was a big traitor?
[1:33:10] <%Zohare> You were told by someone that Atris sent all of the jedi to Katarr but didn't go herself
[1:33:12] <time_axis> she is red if you look at her with force vision prior to then apparently
[1:33:12] <+slimmixrp> Her treatment of you is Dark side
[1:33:13] <grandark_z317> Every interaction with her was evidence.
[1:33:13] <LunarRemix> Woolie she always spoken like a sith, you don't deserve redemption and all of that.
[1:33:13] <Heyestus> I just peace'd out for 10 minutes, did V finally become one with the force like we always thought he would?
[1:33:15] <+ntfth> Hey woolie, some trivia i thought you might find interesting. The ban on relationships within the context of Kotor is super recent. There were married (but widowed) Jedi on the Council at the start of the Mandalorian wars.
[1:33:16] <TDAWS_MP132> then it wouldn't be a reveal
[1:33:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie, did you not listen to her speak? How she STILL has the Exile's saber?
[1:33:16] <GodGoshDarnIt> Whats happening everybody? Just got here
[1:33:17] <TDAWS_MP132> ???
[1:33:19] <shutupandjam3465> it comes later
[1:33:27] <+VCRUZZO> Yeah just wait a bit Woolie
[1:33:27] <+oda_flobunaga> play the game Woolie
[1:33:28] <RantingRavager> React to the future, JEdi
[1:33:28] <+doc_ock_rokc> It really comes later
[1:33:30] <naoi0> @Heyestus Game crashed, bathroom break
[1:33:30] <Space_Pagan> It'll come later, don't worry
[1:33:30] <Kirbachev> @WoolieVersus Your first encounter combined with her input during the council flashbacks highlights that she was already going down that route.
[1:33:32] <%spiritofmojave> mean Atris ducking out of Katarr because she KNEW what was coming is inherently fucked
[1:33:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie she's STILL cuddling the Exile's saber. Bitch be yandere as fuck.
[1:33:33] <+Reverend_Roscoe> did you forget literally everything you saw earlier?
[1:33:34] <%christopherwpoindexter> She wasn't just an arrogant Jedi POS, remember how much you hated her at the beginning?
[1:33:37] <%Javaa01> Then just wait
[1:33:39] <lotharrio> The council was also like, "What do you mean Atris is alive?"
[1:33:39] <GodGoshDarnIt> Did i miss anything?
[1:33:40] <TDAWS_MP132> totally fair
[1:33:43] <phatmac16> I get you Woolie
[1:33:45] <+oda_flobunaga> its been years
[1:33:46] <+krispen_wa> r@woolieversus emember when she told you DESERVED TO DIE in the Mandalorian Wars
[1:33:48] <Heyestus> @naoi0 tah.
[1:33:49] <%Ashenik1> Woolie say it with us 14 MONTHS
[1:33:49] <phatmac16> You’re right
[1:33:50] <RantingRavager> @GodGoshDarnIt you missed the game crashing
[1:33:50] <+jiggy_snipe> you hated Atris til you met Vrook
[1:33:52] <%christopherwpoindexter> i think ur instinct was actually onto something. even as light side
[1:33:53] <Ids560> I think, "you deserved to die to that supernuke because I'm butthurt" is pretty far gone
[1:33:54] <+cubbywolf> Hey Woolie, going to walk my dog and listen to the podcast, have a nice day!
[1:33:57] <$TheFabledAble> @WoolieVersus Kreia literally said the line "she has taken the first steps I think..." refering to atris' emotional state and her strange academy without students
[1:34:00] <dinnydanny777> Apathy is in fact, death
[1:34:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> @jiggy_snipe Nope, I still hate Atris, I just hate Vrook more.
[1:34:08] <+VCRUZZO> @CommanderSqueaks She can't let it go...she can't
[1:34:09] <+krispen_wa> @woolieversus Remember when she told you that you DESERVED TO DIE in the Mando wars
[1:34:12] <%christopherwpoindexter> @cubbywolf 👋🏻
[1:34:17] <%FallenAngelZelos> even though it was developed in 14 months the games faults are still worth talking about
[1:34:17] <GodGoshDarnIt> @RantingRavager Noice LUL
[1:34:19] <Space_Pagan> Atris has been sliding down the slippery slope for a while now
[1:34:22] <Kirbachev> @WoolieVersus MOTHERFUCKER IS THAT SOME JAMESON WHISKEY
[1:34:33] <naoi0> Only siths deal in absolutes
[1:34:34] <+oda_flobunaga> that was 65 hours ago RP time
[1:34:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> I'm more worried about the Energy Drink Woolie has in shot.
[1:34:42] <+VCRUZZO> @Kirbachev mhm
[1:34:44] <KiddKame> I mean, There was the moment when the Exile calls Atris out during their first meeting, Atris disassociating Handmaiden. All the Kreia lines
[1:34:45] <dinnydanny777> Atris walks a lonely road
[1:34:48] <Kirbachev> awww yeeeee
[1:34:56] <%JaceDarkstar> madolorian's did nothing wrong
[1:34:59] <brachydios777> @naoi0 Obi-wan says as an absolute
[1:35:01] <%christopherwpoindexter> It's also been a very long time since we last talked with Atris
[1:35:04] <dinnydanny777> Atris walks the only road that she has ever know
[1:35:05] <+jiggy_snipe> i mean did you want her to murder someone?
[1:35:06] <naoi0> Phfff
[1:35:09] <DatAsuna> And she's been in the big red room since before you even met her
[1:35:16] <%FallenAngelZelos> she's the worst parts of both jedi and sith
[1:35:26] <naoi0> Ancient sith tongues
[1:35:30] <Kirbachev> Such a quiet thing. To fall.
[1:35:36] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Some Sith have had similar mentality
[1:35:39] <DatAsuna> This isn't the anakin moment quite because Atris fell before the game even started
[1:35:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> @FallenAngelZelos She's got the evilness of the Sith, but the delusion self-righteousnous of a Jedi.
[1:35:45] <%christopherwpoindexter> but remember that argument at the beginning? how un-Jedi she was? how judgemental?
[1:35:55] <time_axis> end task real life
[1:35:56] <Manjove> doesn't know where it goes.
[1:35:57] <naoi0> The game was rigged from the start Kappa
[1:35:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> Fuck Atris is SO interesting. The idea of a Jedi who falls and doesn't even REALIZE it.
[1:36:01] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[1:36:03] <@Menitta> I wish I could Ctrl Z life
[1:36:05] <Scrub_Seeker> LUL
[1:36:05] <%spiritofmojave> If only
[1:36:06] <+VCRUZZO> Fuck
[1:36:07] <dinnydanny777> End Task : Pandemic
[1:36:09] <%christopherwpoindexter> @naoi0 LITERALLY OBSIDIAN
[1:36:09] <+oda_flobunaga> Alt- f4 reality
[1:36:14] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @RantingRavager
[1:36:15] <%christopherwpoindexter> SAME
[1:36:18] <lotharrio> The whole Echani handmaiden system that Atris was trying to put together can also be seen as: I want a cadre of loyal Jedi-proof assassins answerable only to me, keeping watch on everyone else in my order.
[1:36:18] <%GeneralSCPatton> ALT+F4 PROCRASTINATION
[1:36:20] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> Aw yeah
[1:36:22] <tuesti> Atris and Kreia are both complex and i love the writing so much
[1:36:24] <$TheFabledAble> @WoolieVersus Atris is a character who went SO hard Lawful Good that she decided no one else is capable of being as Lawfully Good as her so she conspires and kills others fully believing shes doing it right. Making her the biggest Lawful Evil asshole"
[1:36:32] <DatAsuna> should be able to ctrl alt delete your way to task manager
[1:36:34] <%GiantPapaDoug> well remember even at the start anakin was delusional and thought the jedi were evil and what he was doing was justified
[1:36:41] <naoi0> Kek that's interesting
[1:36:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> @lotharrio Who are also blind to the Force and thus cannot feel the straight EVIL radiating off of her.
[1:36:46] <+SolidusRex> Some one managed to End Task the killer hornets, it's possible
[1:36:47] <%GiantPapaDoug> till he got turned into a monty python black knight skit
[1:36:50] <dinnydanny777> Killing people is ok because they're dark side
[1:36:54] <naoi0> But how could you kill jedi?!
[1:36:54] <%Ashenik1> It would have been such a dick and great move if from that point the game deletes all of your saves exept the auto save and all the deaths are canon
[1:36:55] <+evbites> projecting
[1:36:56] <+UberWolfman> OPERATING SYSTEMANIC RACISM LUL
[1:37:03] <naoi0> I don't understand!
[1:37:03] <+jiggy_snipe> yea projecting
[1:37:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> She BEEN on 6.
[1:37:05] <dinnydanny777> It's okay to kill people if you think they're evil
[1:37:09] <Doodle_Taco> Big projecting
[1:37:11] <shutupandjam3465> YOU DESERVED TO DIE AT MALACHOR V
[1:37:14] <subjectg> She isn’t in the best state of mind right now
[1:37:17] <DatAsuna> from moment 1
[1:37:17] <%christopherwpoindexter> but remember she sounded like 3-4 on that scale when you met her
[1:37:20] <Heyestus> J'accuse as fuck
[1:37:21] <shutupandjam3465> IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN YOUR GRAVE
[1:37:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> She's been the dark side since you FIRST met her.
[1:37:22] <%spiritofmojave> it's the woman drowning during the Salem Witch Trials, being 'vindicated' by sacrifice. that warped type thing
[1:37:23] <+VCRUZZO> yeah
[1:37:24] <+jiggy_snipe> it's more subtle
[1:37:26] <+MidnightBurst12> mask off moment
[1:37:28] <+jiggy_snipe> than hahahaha im evil
[1:37:28] <naoi0> @Ashenik1 This ain't undertale
[1:37:30] <%JaceDarkstar> when ever I play my Xbox version the game crashes every time
[1:37:35] <+krispen_wa> Woolie needs Pat to explain some psychology here
[1:37:38] <%alrobot2014> she said it would reflect YOUR teachings as well
[1:37:38] <subjectg> but yes, it’s a subtle thing
[1:37:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> She still is.
[1:37:44] <KiddKame> From experience, on my old gaming laptop I always kept Task Manager open whenever I played my games for just occasions
[1:37:53] <dinnydanny777> She thinks you're evil and that she's justified for killing you when really she's evil
[1:37:55] <+slimmixrp> @WoolieVersus The way she treats you
[1:37:55] <Zebroneath> Only Sith talk in absolutes.
[1:37:57] <+Reverend_Roscoe> 100%
[1:38:01] <%therealtacopancakes> Falling is quiet. admitting it is harder
[1:38:01] <time_axis> closet dark side
[1:38:02] <DatAsuna> I have a donation to make after you finish this scene so yee
[1:38:02] <naoi0> ONLY A SITH DEALS IN ABSOLUTES
[1:38:03] <8hoursofdrugs> force persuade > force dominate > force gaslight
[1:38:04] <%GiantPapaDoug> hey kotor 2 doesnt like discord streaming either
[1:38:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> Atris is Yandere
[1:38:13] <%GiantPapaDoug> so it crashes all the times when i try to show my friends
[1:38:14] <%christopherwpoindexter> SHE was in the council, but extremely dismissive and emotional
[1:38:15] <%FallenAngelZelos> @Zebroneath "You took her from MEEEEE"
[1:38:22] <lotharrio> She was in denial. She's been dark side since, at least, the moment she started to put her "new Jedi order" together. Cause the framework is sketchy as fuck.
[1:38:24] <naoi0> Yes goooo
[1:38:30] <tuesti> love this part aaaahhhhhh
[1:38:30] <naoi0> The answers lie in the heart of battle!
[1:38:31] <%Bluemanzee> Not too many drugs
[1:38:34] <+evbites> ahh yes one of the teachings from pockets
[1:38:35] <Kirbachev> This is the most wholesome chat I've ever seen for this game. Everyone's just talking about the game without screeching, and I love it.
[1:38:36] <+krispen_wa> DRUGS
[1:38:36] <%DSD24> So is that 3 crashes in total?
[1:38:41] <+jiggy_snipe> now drugs but not as many
[1:38:43] <$TheFabledAble> good so far
[1:38:44] <akman14> We reach a quarter of a million subscribers
[1:38:44] <Doodle_Taco> Nope
[1:38:45] <%Ghostbody> good
[1:38:46] <%alrobot2014> no crunch yet
[1:38:47] <%DemonOfSalt> Sound is good.
[1:38:47] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> you might wanna include this conversation in the anime
[1:38:48] <shutupandjam3465> this game is so fucking awesome
[1:38:49] <stevenellis386> NO the answer lies in the heart of the cards
[1:38:50] <dinnydanny777> Can we check if Atris is even light side anymore
[1:38:51] <%Ashenik1> good
[1:38:51] <Rainphoon> all is good
[1:38:54] <NekoZen> synch test
[1:38:55] <%FallenAngelZelos> sound's good
[1:38:56] <grandark_z317> @kirbachev screechers aren't here yet
[1:38:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> @lotharrio The fact that she didn't show up at the Council meeting proves that she, subconciously, knows she's fallen.
[1:38:57] <Augus7717> all good
[1:38:58] <+oda_flobunaga> just two people talking over the game
[1:39:02] <%spiritofmojave> good shape!

[1:39:19] <heartlesshealer> probably include that conversation in the anime somehow, yeah
[1:39:19] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:39:24] <tuesti> I never even realized Atris not being at the trial meant something
[1:39:25] <dinnydanny777> Yeah but can we check if she glows red or blue
[1:39:29] <Kirbachev> @grandark_z317 suddenly saved by the bell
[1:39:29] <heartlesshealer> or at least bring it up in next podcast
[1:39:31] <%GiantPapaDoug> which drugs make you kill the younglings?

[1:42:41] <Kirbachev> @christopherwpoindexter Nah, that sounds about right :p I'm 34, so I'm an oldie for Twitch standards. I love the medium, though. It's a beautiful combination of arts and sciences and it deserves more credit.

[1:57:54] <+oda_flobunaga> what aboutism
[1:57:54] <naoi0> This is the version of Pat saying "It's all Cole's fault" in LA Noire but actually right
[1:57:56] <%christopherwpoindexter> She is one of the only light side murders in my mind
[1:58:00] <olaksi> She actually has point here
[1:58:00] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Look at this Jedi talking about fighting a war of extermination.

[1:58:16] <%mostly_simple> woolie using talk no jutsu
[1:58:26] <Halospaz117> You know, it sounds to me like Atris is thinking she'll do Light Later
[1:58:26] <tranquilturnip> Could it be theorized that your force bond ability has fucked with Atris's mind too?
[1:58:34] <dinnydanny777> Us?
[1:58:34] <+krispen_wa> YOU WHAT
[1:58:37] <RantingRavager> Me?
[1:58:39] <%spiritofmojave> Gongaga.

[1:58:45] <+oda_flobunaga> BULL SHIT
[1:58:45] <%christopherwpoindexter> top to bottom, just like Atris 😏
[1:58:47] <Joestar1890> Moi?
[1:58:49] <Too_Much_Nukie> The force has always revolved around YOU huh? Little biased there Atris?
[1:58:52] <tranquilturnip> @spiritofmojave me? Gongaga
[1:58:53] <+jiggy_snipe> @tranquilturnip she seems to hate you instead of follow you
[1:58:57] <%Ghostbody> Un huh.
[1:59:06] <subjectg> @spiritofmojave you know gongaga?
[1:59:12] <+VCRUZZO> @tranquilturnip huh...never actually thought of that till now
[1:59:13] <%BearSawed> I tryed to save the whales, BY MURDERING ALL THE WHALES
[1:59:16] <%DSD24> Woolie needs a minute
[1:59:17] <tranquilturnip> @jiggy_snipe you're right, and I wonder if your forcebond somehow backfired and had a reverse effect
[1:59:21] <%Ghostbody> uhhhhhh
[1:59:22] <grandark_z317> She Epitaph'd and then King Crimson'd the results.
[1:59:26] <+oda_flobunaga> FUCK THIS KAREN
[1:59:26] <+evbites> Yes A.T.R.I.S that spells fanny pakk
[1:59:27] <Dova573> Man
[1:59:28] <+jiggy_snipe> @tranquilturnip that's a fun theory
[1:59:31] <%Chisas_Dead_Body> AAAAS
[1:59:31] <%mostly_simple> I used the stones to destroy the stones
[1:59:34] <honeyman18> Atris more like what the shit?
[1:59:37] <grandark_z317> ALL THAT MATTERS ARE THE RESULTS
[1:59:47] <Joestar1890> I am one of the sith!? *I* am on of the sith?
[1:59:48] <+doc_ock_rokc> She Doxed you
[1:59:57] <olaksi> I don't think she realized the planet was going to be annihilated?
[1:59:57] <+krispen_wa> So Hungry Boy never would have found them if it didn't leak?
[1:59:58] <dinnydanny777> Remember when we made those soldiers run through landmines, haha...
[2:00:00] <Teras_ode> "I want to speak to your manager, and by manager I mean Revan" LUL
[2:00:00] <+VCRUZZO> maybe its a side effect of Malachor and the connection your had with her broke her then...interesting though
[2:00:00] <+BlockingDisabled> I still can't believe that this is ALL restored content.
[2:00:01] <%DSD24> Atris is a big LEAKER
[2:00:01] <YakumoYomi> Everything goes back to her notion that "You followed Revan, so you must be a Sith and are bad".
[2:00:12] <+doc_ock_rokc> She Doxed you to get you killed by antisith
[2:00:15] <heartlesshealer> about man from vision - you
[2:00:18] <%Ghostbody> Capcom tier leaker
[2:00:22] <+oda_flobunaga> circular logic thinking ass bitch
[2:00:23] <tranquilturnip> @VCRUZZO yeah I'd never thought about it either until now
[2:00:29] <lotharrio> The second leak was about painting a target on you.
[2:00:29] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:00:30] <dinnydanny777> She has a Jedi robe so she can't be a Sith
[2:00:42] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> @BlockingDisabled I don't think this current conversation is restored, just specifics of the Handmaiden fight
[2:00:46] <+VCRUZZO> @tranquilturnip cool thought. Gonna have to note that one
[2:00:47] <Doodle_Taco> Atris leaked the Smash character list
[2:00:57] <lotharrio> Because she didn't think, "Well let's work with the Exile." She went, "Well, it must be that I GOTTA kill that guy."

[2:06:39] <%MrRabbles> the Fanny Stank
[2:06:41] <dinnydanny777> These wounds they will not heal

[2:07:15] <Teras_ode> that dumbfounded facial expression on Fann is so on point right now LUL
[2:07:19] <Too_Much_Nukie> Chodo Habat spoke of this. About how you feel like a dead planet in the force.

[2:08:59] <+jiggy_snipe> Salem witch shit
[2:09:08] <dinnydanny777> She still has your lightsaber drawn
[2:09:17] <heavenlygunner> The power of the Jedi sure does make someone foolish and dumb.
[2:09:17] <lotharrio> "It's either your fault, or you were innocent and your death benefits me. So shrug."
[2:09:18] <dinnydanny777> She's just waiting
[2:09:19] <%spiritofmojave> @ashenik1 LUL
[2:09:22] <+Alexandoas> She has been hitting that tiger blood hard hasn’t she?
[2:09:23] <%christopherwpoindexter> @yakumoyomi 😆
[2:09:30] <Shade075> And this is to go further beyond Jedi scjBlast1
[2:09:41] <naoi0> Force gods
[2:09:42] <tuesti> so was the Exile actually cut off from the force? and regained it from their companions? or did the wound from cutting themself off gave it to his companions?
[2:09:49] <dinnydanny777> Atris is literally being like "swing first" right now
[2:09:49] <%Ashenik1> I am so fucking glad I am bi
[2:09:51] <+jiggy_snipe> no Atris is ultimate Light Side later
[2:10:09] <+Purple_badger3000> As a jedi all I do is just therefore the ends justify the means
[2:10:09] <snakemuho> wow she really is
[2:10:11] <Archmortal> The murder of BILLIONS AND AN ENTIRE PLANET was worth it!
[2:10:13] <naoi0> @tuesti Pretty sure the first of like acting as a siphon and encourager of the force
[2:10:13] <anita_dickin> super jedi god super jedi rosé
[2:10:14] <+oda_flobunaga> @WoolieVersus Hungry Boi and Thirsty Bae
[2:10:14] <dinnydanny777> Is Atris waiting for you to swing so she can justify it
[2:10:16] <ingman112> The companions actually are force sensitive. The exile’s natural tendency with bonds attracts them
[2:10:16] <%SilvaChariot0133> "We did it! We saved the galaxy!"
[2:10:22] <Teras_ode> "but you going to war with man´dalorians is very bad :( "

[2:10:33] <Doodle_Taco> LUL
[2:10:36] <+krispen_wa> LUL
[2:10:37] <+gutlesscoward> too bad she doesn't have console commands
[2:10:37] <%spiritofmojave> Paint this image of me! The heroic last remaining Jedi after thousands die vanquishing the Sith
[2:10:38] <Too_Much_Nukie> Woolie, you left her behind. You abandoned Atris and the Jedi. If you're not a Sith then that would raise too many uncomfortable questions for Atris to ask herself. So you must be Sith.
[2:10:39] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> I also wanna remind you Kriea said she doesn't even think Darth Kirby can be beaten
[2:10:40] <lotharrio> "Thousands of Jedi and en entire force sensitive race? Acceptable losses for me to beat the less than a dozen bad guys."
[2:10:41] <%DSD24> @tuesti The Exile cut themself off from the force but because they have force bonding they can feel the force through their companions
[2:10:42] <%Chisas_Dead_Body> LUL
[2:10:44] <%Zohare> @tuesti He's a conduit for the force that is also completely devoid of it
[2:10:47] <Joestar1890> Atris was the ultimate example of LIGHT LATER
[2:10:50] <+VCRUZZO> light side WAYYY later, after I win this long game

[2:23:25] <+oda_flobunaga> she sat on your lightsaber tho
[2:23:28] <+vaporousTippler> The One Ring is an instrument of a powerful will. Those holocrons ARE the powerful wills. Plural.
[2:23:30] <dinnydanny777> She's jealous that you got to commit war crimes

[2:24:27] <lotharrio> @mighty_max_t Less corruption, normally. There was a padawan who had just one for a similar time period and the worst she did was overlook human deaths and some light thieving. Atris just got a library of them where she hangs out and meditates.
[2:24:29] <Halospaz117> It's good when the Evil knowledge isn't literally SCREAMING INTO YOUR HEAD
[2:24:30] <surik_at> Ooof, that hits waaaaay to close home
[2:24:34] <ralphfromdk> But then your enemy turns out to be nazi's and you kinda don't need to understand them any more.
[2:24:34] <lotharrio> She could just... not go in this room.

[2:31:33] <%DSD24> @TomDanksEGOT Drink every time you hear the word echoes
[2:31:33] <+VCRUZZO> EVERYTHING
[2:31:34] <Too_Much_Nukie> Only the strong should survive.
[2:31:34] <heartlesshealer> Force Erasure
[2:31:34] <Matermind0> @tomdanksegot Every time they say echo
[2:31:34] <Second_Omega> ISHHHh
[2:31:38] <dinnydanny777> I am the Last Jedi
[2:31:38] <DatAsuna> She's here to kill god
[2:31:38] <Shade075> Kill the force
[2:31:41] <RantingRavager> DETHRONE AND DEFEAT THE FORCE
[2:31:41] <lotharrio> @dinnydanny777 Theoretically yes. But probably not enough to change anything.
[2:31:41] <+torusendor> That's fucking rad
[2:31:42] <+MidnightBurst12> Complete Galactic Saturation
[2:31:42] <YakumoYomi> @TomDanksEGOT Drink every time you hear echo/echoes
[2:31:43] <%Graxe_> If you kill the Force, only the strong will survive
[2:31:43] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> BUT WHYYYYY

[2:31:46] <+krispen_wa> ATTACK AND DETHRONE THE FORCE
[2:31:46] <+TomDanksEGOT> HAHAH Daaayum
[2:31:46] <+jjjkopf> COMPLETE GALACTIC SATURATION
[2:31:47] <Halospaz117> ZERO FORCE
[2:31:47] <dereks0n> Such a quiet thing
[2:31:47] <Too_Much_Nukie> No Woolie
[2:31:50] <lotharrio> Oh and droids.
[2:31:51] <DatAsuna> No woolie
[2:31:52] <Too_Much_Nukie> There would be no force.
[2:31:54] <Joestar1890> MASS DEATH
[2:31:54] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @blackskulldragon18
[2:31:54] <+oda_flobunaga> BUT WHY THO
[2:31:55] <%Graxe_> And everything will restart from zero
[2:31:57] <DatAsuna> No force at all
[2:31:57] <%jase__x> GRANNY'S GOTTA GO
[2:31:58] <%JohnAtDawn> AND this is where Kriea loses all sympathy.
[2:31:58] <+VCRUZZO> You'd die
[2:31:59] <KiddKame> She wants to DESTROY THE FORCE ITSELF
[2:31:59] <Doodle_Taco> NO FORCE
[2:32:01] <brachydios777> DESTROY THE FORCE!
[2:32:02] <prince_johnny_> There is no force
[2:32:02] <%DSD24> Kill the force
[2:32:03] <tuesti> everything would die
[2:32:05] <Joysta> EXTREMeLY LIMITED POWER
[2:32:06] <Joestar1890> Like only 5 people left
[2:32:06] <+doc_ock_rokc> And nonforce users will be okay
[2:32:09] <Ravingpyro> the Force would die?!
[2:32:09] <Too_Much_Nukie> She wants to get rid of the force Woolie.
[2:32:10] <%Camail> she wants to kill the force
[2:32:13] <prince_johnny_> She would destroy it
[2:32:13] <+oda_flobunaga> destroy it if you have to
[2:32:14] <+evbites> Kriea:WE NORMIES NOW
[2:32:14] <%kyh9> You'd get a handful of super wizards and no one else would even have any magic
[2:32:14] <BliVru> KEEP TALKING Atris answers you
[2:32:15] <lotharrio> The force is basically life.
[2:32:17] <+Zouledge> She is trying to kill the force itself
[2:32:17] <subjectg> @graxe_ << This is what V2 is for >>
[2:32:22] <Joestar1890> no plants, no animals, trillions die
[2:32:24] <tuesti> true
[2:32:27] <+spacehouse> Is it tho?
[2:32:28] <heartlesshealer> We only feel the force because we made bonds with force feelers
[2:32:28] <Teras_ode> I used the force to destroy the force
[2:32:28] <Second_Omega> Ah who needs the force
[2:32:29] <olaksi> She's basically trying to kill god, or the SW equivalent
[2:32:31] <$NoWayRyanTatum> NO MORE ELEMENT BENDERS
[2:32:36] <grandark_z317> She wants a world without Force.
[2:32:37] <ralphfromdk> She will kill the whole universe / all force. Only leaving behind things like you that are cut of from it.
[2:32:38] <DatAsuna> Woolie why do you think the masters kept saying you were the death of the force?
[2:32:40] <Too_Much_Nukie> Woolie, you can't use the force.
[2:32:43] <ingman112> The force is connected to life, inextricably
[2:32:44] <cheapdoc> nah, this is beyond killing god
[2:32:45] <Halospaz117> YES
[2:32:46] <MrWizard0022> I mean, if there's absolutely no one left that can perceive the presence of the force, it basically ceases to exist...
[2:32:46] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> But Why Tho?
[2:32:47] <tolloponik> Yes
[2:32:47] <+MidnightBurst12> TRUE EQUALITY
[2:32:49] <RantingRavager> ONLY DROIDS SURVIVE
[2:32:50] <Halospaz117> THE ANSWER IS YES
[2:32:51] <anita_dickin> one and the same
[2:32:53] <tuesti> yes
[2:32:54] <Treuan> Medichlorians become poison
[2:32:55] <+spacehouse> EXILE is LIVING PROOF
[2:32:57] <Joestar1890> The force is in EVERYTHING
[2:33:00] <%GrassCannon> Forceless would mean lifeless, but lifeless wouldn't necessarily mean forceless
[2:33:04] <dereks0n> That's like a 0.01%
[2:33:06] <+krispen_wa> One in like millions
[2:33:07] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus This is why the council and every master said you might be the death of the force
[2:33:07] <tranquilturnip> Bao Dur is also a hollow shell of a person now
[2:33:07] <ingman112> She wants one...but it’s probably going to be the other
[2:33:07] <honeyman18> Life-Force = Patrick Stewart Vampire
[2:33:08] <Kirbachev> Theoretically. She wants a universe without Force infuence. Kreia sees the Force as a detached entity and hates it for being able to influence everything so deeply.
[2:33:09] <+jiggy_snipe> just you and droids
[2:33:14] <+evbites> Kriea: star wars is stupid I wanna be star trek
[2:33:15] <lotharrio> The Exile is a big mutant that you shouldn't expect to happen... often.
[2:33:17] <%Camail> like 30 people in the galaxy after that
[2:33:21] <+Ancopro> darth T3 will win
[2:33:21] <cheapdoc> this is trying to FORCE evolution, like if someone tried to switch oxygen with something else
[2:33:23] <dereks0n> OH
[2:33:25] <%DSD24> Damn
[2:33:25] <anita_dickin> world peace through global extinction

[2:35:59] <%spiritofmojave> it's interesting though because Kreia actually wants you to live, Atris has a warped love

[2:38:09] <Joestar1890> Kreia read too much Atlas Shrugged
[2:38:09] <+oda_flobunaga> @WoolieVersus She wants to kill Kaguya
[2:38:12] <jamesthebrave> She wants to kill the force and she doesnt' care how many lives go along with it
[2:38:12] <%Zohare> It will get rid of a lot of people too
[2:38:14] <Joostebrood> @Joestar1890 Arcade was written by Sawyer. Cass I'll give you. iirc Avellone wrote a vanilla romances in NWN 2 and one of those was still just incredibly creepy.
[2:38:16] <heartlesshealer> she wants to destroy the concept of the force
[2:38:17] <Zebroneath> Kreia holds more value over persuade and force persuade options.
[2:38:19] <%DSD24> @DorianCreed Oh shit is that why his name was Andrew Ryan?
[2:38:21] <+evbites> granny: I wanna be star trek

[2:38:59] <%GeneralSCPatton> The right man in the wrong place can make all the difference in the world.
[2:38:59] <+griffball13> SHUT UP BITCH
[2:39:01] <phatmac16> GET ON WITH IT
[2:39:02] <Halospaz117> loop
[2:39:04] <olaksi> Lawful Stupid option never disappears LUL
[2:39:04] <+evbites> SNITCH
[2:39:04] <Second_Omega> HOES MAD
[2:39:04] <%Malik1002> SOOO GALATIC GENOCIDE
[2:39:04] <+krispen_wa> CLAP CLAP CLAP
[2:39:07] <phatmac16> YOU TALK TOO MUCH
[2:39:10] <corwinner> She wants to kill the force and doesnt care how many will die as long the rest is free of it.
[2:39:12] <dereks0n> CM PUNK CM PUNK
[2:39:15] <Joostebrood> I do live that randos in the current year still accuse Avellone of being a randian over this one character he wrote in 2004.
[2:39:21] <lotharrio> Yo Woolie, if 95% of life dies out in the blastwave, but you attack and dethrone God in the process... is it worth it? This boomer's answer might surprise you.
[2:39:29] <Joestar1890> "THIS IS BORING"- Sithy bois
[2:39:32] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @grandark_z317
[2:39:40] <akman14> Greater good
[2:39:44] <time_axis> I'm blind to this game but maybe we will get to ask her.
[2:39:46] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> @WoolieVersus Ask her why you COULDN'T TELL she was a Sith?
[2:39:46] <wowowinsane> kreia secretly LOVES droids
[2:39:51] <jamesthebrave> She knows, she just doesn't care
[2:39:51] <$TheFabledAble> Its believed that the force and life are interconnected to the point that one would end the other. But YOU prove that life can persist outside of the force's influence
[2:39:51] <heartlesshealer> Kreia just hates the Force THAT MUCH
[2:39:52] <olaksi> She's probably on Thanos sith
[2:39:52] <honeyman18> Mass Effect Reaper Logic?
[2:39:54] <+slimmixrp> She seeks knowledge maybe she just wants to see what happens?
[2:39:55] <+oda_flobunaga> Play the Game Woolie.... and see
[2:40:00] <e3a4> It is a risk she is willing to take
[2:40:00] <tolloponik> why are the sith trying to not let her tell you kreia's plan will kill them to
[2:40:02] <+evbites> yes
[2:40:09] <Teras_ode> "Master Fann I don't feel so good"
[2:40:10] <+akikyou> Don't the Yuuzhan live outside the force?
[2:40:10] <anita_dickin> HIES MAD
[2:40:10] <+ntfth> She hates the Force and wants to kill it...but absolutely loathes droids.
[2:40:13] <Djinnazz> git gud?
[2:40:13] <+doc_ock_rokc> @Joostebrood there are people who claim people are racist from comments made over 20 years ago. people are stupid
[2:40:16] <anita_dickin> hoes mad
[2:40:16] <+VCRUZZO> yup
[2:40:17] <+oda_flobunaga> HOES MAD
[2:40:19] <dereks0n> LIGHT LATER
[2:40:25] <Kirbachev> @WoolieVersus "A long time ago in a galaxy etc" What if it already happened, and we lost the Force millenia ago.
[2:40:26] <%spiritofmojave> Force can't be entrusted to either power struggle of these individuals, GREATER GOOD as an idea
[2:40:26] <dinnydanny777> You ever seen Hot Fuzz?
[2:40:27] <phatmac16> AGE OF MAN
[2:40:27] <%JohnAtDawn> Except there will be none
[2:40:29] <lotharrio> There will be droids.
[2:40:30] <cheapdoc> the ULTIMATE light later
[2:40:30] <+VCRUZZO> light later
[2:40:31] <RantingRavager> THE AGE OF MAN
[2:40:32] <ingman112> Kreia is all about survival of the fittest. You survived, so did she. Any losses are acceptable casualties to get rid of the Force
[2:40:32] <$NoWayRyanTatum> THE CIRCLE IS CLOSED
[2:40:33] <+griffball13> the lightest later
[2:40:33] <tranquilturnip> tear the bandaid off
[2:40:34] <%chiluzza> Money in pockets?
[2:40:34] <%GrassCannon> KILL THEM ALL LET THE GODS SORT IT OUT
[2:40:35] <%JohnAtDawn> Except the exile
[2:40:36] <Dova573> FUCK THAT
[2:40:36] <+ntfth> @akikyou No, they're stripped of the Force but still a part of it.
[2:40:37] <%Chisas_Dead_Body> Full circle
[2:40:37] <+evbites> that works
[2:40:38] <%DSD24> Age of Dark!
[2:40:39] <%Bluemanzee> Light mad Hoes later
[2:40:39] <phatmac16> THE AGE OF MAN IS NOW
[2:40:39] <Teras_ode> Use force to destroy the force
[2:40:40] <+Purple_badger3000> Remember, Kreia HATES the force
[2:40:40] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Fuckin Tau bs
[2:40:41] <%Reizie_Etherealm> << This twisted force needs to be reset >>
[2:40:43] <heartlesshealer> Actually delete religion to destroy its ability to corrupt life
[2:40:44] <+MidnightBurst12> the age of darkness begins now
[2:40:45] <+VCRUZZO> the tech still works
[2:40:50] <+slimmixrp> Just BE
[2:40:50] <Exodusprime1256> she is destroying FATE
[2:40:55] <%spiritofmojave> LUL
[2:40:55] <dereks0n> Look at the Rakatans, they're just one example
[2:40:56] <Halospaz117> Dying due to the loss of the force is better than living with it to her
[2:40:58] <+Brostress> so, the interesting bits from Last Jedi lol
[2:40:58] <anita_dickin> kdk
[2:40:59] <olaksi> THE DARK SOULS OF STAR WARS
[2:41:04] <+rider_megalon> the road to he'll is paved with goid intentions
[2:41:07] <%FallenAngelZelos> naw man
[2:41:09] <Joostebrood> @doc_ock_rokc it's just hilarious is all. Dude hasn't even read Rand - he's just super into characters who look critically at their own universe.
[2:41:09] <RantingRavager> GREY SITH
[2:41:10] <+VCRUZZO> she is so not
[2:41:11] <%BearSawed> needs of the few
[2:41:12] <Th3rd3> time to end the cycle
[2:41:15] <Too_Much_Nukie> She's not a grey jedi or a sith.
[2:41:15] <%Camail> she's very evil
[2:41:16] <Joestar1890> She is FAAAAR from Jedi
[2:41:17] <+infinite_rotation> Hmmmm
[2:41:19] <Kirbachev> can I yell about V being a great cohost and I want to see more of him
[2:41:20] <tolloponik> a Grith
[2:41:20] <Too_Much_Nukie> Kreia is not a sith at all.
[2:41:21] <anita_dickin> So is Kreia just Kathee
[2:41:21] <Shade075> She wants to destroy the repetitive nature of Star Wars
[2:41:23] <+infinite_rotation> Thats evil as shit
[2:41:24] <Doodle_Taco> Kreia is honestly just Kreia
[2:41:25] <%bread_assassin> a grey sith?
[2:41:26] <+evbites> She hates the force
[2:41:27] <+TomDanksEGOT> basically if anyone is touched by the force they are tainted and there death is no serious loss
[2:41:29] <Joestar1890> Jolee is still the golden standard
[2:41:30] <%DSD24> "This twisted game needs to be reset"
[2:41:30] <jamesthebrave> You've gotta remember that as much as may hate the label, Kreia is Sith. She is in now way shape or form a force for good
[2:41:31] <%Camail> she's normal evil, not sith evil
[2:41:33] <tolloponik> a Griffith if you will
[2:41:35] <ingman112> She’s just gray
[2:41:35] <phatmac16> She's just an angry granny
[2:41:36] <+oda_flobunaga> Kreia is Best Waifu
[2:41:36] <YakumoYomi> "Survival of the fittest" definitely seems like Sith ideology.
[2:41:39] <$TheFabledAble> She isnt a sith in my book. because she doesnt seek power for power's sake
[2:41:40] <dinnydanny777> She's a Sith leaning Grey Jedi
[2:41:41] <%GeneralSCPatton> For all the fuckery it causes, the Force might as well be a Lovecraftian elder god manipulating everything.
[2:41:43] <Joostebrood> (not really confirmed i'd argue but still)
[2:41:45] <+VCRUZZO> shes down
[2:41:48] <%MrRabbles> Grey Sith
[2:41:51] <+infinite_rotation> GRANNY DID NOTHING WRONG
[2:41:52] <shutupandjam3465> I think shes really just on a different level. Shes almost the antithesis of what you would expect of a star wars character
[2:41:52] <%chiluzza> that sounds so fucking sith
[2:41:53] <Exodusprime1256> *cut to kreia 1v1ing lord gwyn*
[2:41:53] <Ids560> the answer to this question is "If they're too weak to handle it fuck em"
[2:41:55] <MrWizard0022> I guess "Kreia" might be grey, if Kreia is who she actually was, but Traya? Nope, full Sith.
[2:41:56] <KrazeArcain> she is the one and only gray sith
[2:41:58] <e3a4> The Force already kills people by being around, it enslaves you
[2:42:01] <snakemuho> compartmentalized as fuck
[2:42:02] <olaksi> She's like the ultimate "if he dies he dies" type
[2:42:05] <Teras_ode> Senator Armstrong Krea LUL
[2:42:06] <%Camail> Struggle.
[2:42:08] <phatmac16> she's just gilgamesh from UBW
[2:42:09] <+jiggy_snipe> she's neither sith nor jedi, she's something else, somethinh crazy
[2:42:17] <+Feralspirit41> Hit everyone with your car to make them stronger
[2:42:17] <%GrassCannon> Last line of the Sith code is "the Force shall free me" I don't think killing the Force is very Sithlike
[2:42:18] <Joestar1890> That's pretty fuckin' red
[2:42:21] <+VCRUZZO> grey jedi is a lie
[2:42:30] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Making the mother of all omeletes here Fann!! Can't fret over every egg!!
[2:42:35] <+evbites> kriea is a human
[2:42:35] <%Ashenik1> of course she isnt the grey , she is a true JEDI Kappa
[2:42:38] <time_axis> We haven't really heard her side of the story yet. I don't know.
[2:42:38] <+krispen_wa> Of course, this all assumes that the Death of thje Force is TRULY what Kreia wants
[2:42:39] <tuesti> Jolee is grey
[2:42:40] <%GiantPapaDoug> that's the big reason why she isnt either jedi or sith
[2:42:41] <Doodle_Taco> i would be down if we got hit by the Arrow honestly...
[2:42:44] <%chiluzza> Grey Jedi are always hacks
[2:42:44] <%FallenAngelZelos> and that's, NO GOOD
[2:42:46] <%ACrystalSage> Galaxy reset
[2:42:48] <Ids560> even then that's ignoring the desires of those that want to have the force
[2:42:49] <%GiantPapaDoug> because she took both codes and rejects them
[2:42:50] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1270228062764969985
[2:42:51] <+Kduff89> I'm starting to realize the writers of infamous had to have LOVED kotor2
[2:42:53] <+rider_megalon> she's a grey Sith
[2:42:53] <%KongolComet> Kyle Katarn best grey
[2:42:53] <YakumoYomi> @Teras_ode "Midichlorians, son."
[2:42:53] <dinnydanny777> She's a dark grey jedi
[2:42:54] <lotharrio> Hey guess what? She's a damn Sith.
[2:42:54] <+evbites> Granny is an athiest
[2:42:58] <Kirbachev> @WoolieVersus She's grey, but she's flexible. She has seen all sides of the firce, enough to hate what it brings out of people.
[2:42:58] <%GiantPapaDoug> because both rely on the force
[2:42:59] <+griffball13> accetible losses
[2:43:00] <Too_Much_Nukie> Sith is not a synonym for evil. Kreia isn't a Sith just because she's willing to kill people for a goal.
[2:43:01] <+krispen_wa> 4
[2:43:01] <%Ashenik1> fuck her
[2:43:03] <+krispen_wa> FUCKING 4
[2:43:03] <dinnydanny777> Kyle Katarn is absolutely best grey Jedi
[2:43:04] <%GiantPapaDoug> and she hates it
[2:43:06] <+Feralspirit41> Kill her
[2:43:06] <Joostebrood> eh - fundamentally altering the core of trillions' of people's identity isn't that grey (screw you Mass Effect 3 writers)
[2:43:07] <%DSD24> You get to wear this Dunce Cap I made for you
[2:43:10] <%GiantPapaDoug> but she isnt a grey jedi.
[2:43:16] <shutupandjam3465> forgive her
[2:43:22] <brachydios777> Movie Thanos with a higher body count
[2:43:26] <%GiantPapaDoug> she is the antithesis to the force
[2:43:35] <RantingRavager> No one actually liked you FeelsBadMan
[2:43:38] <tuesti> yeah that's fucked
[2:43:38] <Exodusprime1256> I have a dream, that one day, a man will have his own fate, a land of the truly free damnit
[2:43:39] <snakemuho> JESSICAAAH
[2:43:40] <+vaporousTippler> There's a theory on Anakin like that.
[2:43:40] <+krispen_wa> Visas already told you that she didn't love you because of the bond
[2:43:42] <heartlesshealer> My parents loved me because of the force
[2:43:43] <+oda_flobunaga> Geralt and Yenn?
[2:43:44] <%spiritofmojave> What the hell is 3, what council LUL
[2:43:44] <%bread_assassin> What council?
[2:43:46] <tranquilturnip> LUL
[2:43:47] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> What council?
[2:43:48] <grandark_z317> sounds like a certain something from P5R
[2:43:48] <tiduidu> Light Later Man
[2:43:49] <Ids560> WHO?
[2:43:50] <dinnydanny777> Kill the force if you have to
[2:43:51] <wowowinsane> I AM THE COUNCIL
[2:43:55] <%Camail> i am the council
[2:43:55] <%Graxe_> I am the Council
[2:43:55] <Halospaz117> ANSWER TO THE BODIES
[2:43:55] <+jiggy_snipe> what council?
[2:43:57] <%GrassCannon> NOT. YET.
[2:43:58] <%DSD24> I am the Council!
[2:44:00] <blizzagan> "The Council will decide your fate"
[2:44:01] <Space_Pagan> Fanny???? WHAT
[2:44:03] <%MrRabbles> COUNCIL OF CORPSES
[2:44:09] <+griffball13> just weekend at burnies the jedi
[2:44:12] <Joostebrood> I like 1 the best - it has the best response too, honestly.
[2:44:14] <Second_Omega> Renegade for Life
[2:44:14] <Th3rd3> I'm the COUNCIL
[2:44:16] <tolloponik> Leon: I must save the City
[2:44:16] <olaksi> Stupid Lawful - Wait what law?
[2:44:18] <shutupandjam3465> 1
[2:44:19] <dereks0n> The Corpse (Nothing)s will decide your fate
[2:44:21] <Space_Pagan> Answer to Corpses (Nothing)!
[2:44:21] <+krispen_wa> 4
[2:44:21] <lotharrio> He might. But it's also just innate to him. His Charisma is supernatural, but he was born with it... so can he even feel bad about it? Should he?
[2:44:22] <Exodusprime1256> a nation of action not words, ruled by strength, not the force
[2:44:23] <Divryne> There is no council. DIE.
[2:44:26] <%GrassCannon> Council of corpses is gonna by the name of my next album
[2:44:28] <heartlesshealer> oh wow
[2:44:28] <Teras_ode> LUL
[2:44:29] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Stupid Good
[2:44:31] <%Camail> ouch
[2:44:32] <%Atomik456> reverse cadaver synod
[2:44:33] <phatmac16> SIT DOWN
[2:44:36] <%spiritofmojave> You will ANSWER TO their force ghosts, oh.. wait
[2:44:40] <%Ashenik1> sith the fuck down
[2:44:41] <dinnydanny777> Wow
[2:44:42] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Fann Y'Pak used the code superbeast on checkout for native deodorant and got a harem by having such a manly scent
[2:44:42] <+krispen_wa> JEEZUS
[2:44:50] <dinnydanny777> Yes
[2:44:52] <dereks0n> I mean what are they gonna do, blink at her?
[2:44:56] <Kirbachev> "enjoy your own personal hell."
[2:44:59] <prince_johnny_> Damn
[2:44:59] <+VCRUZZO> that is literal "stay in your lane"
[2:45:03] <%GeneralSCPatton> As long as you believe in your nakama and ensure their trust in you isn't misplaced, then it is fine.
[2:45:08] <Enemy_In_Disguise> “Take this L”
[2:45:11] <Teras_ode> *REEEEEs in sith*
[2:45:14] <%DSD24> I like 1
[2:45:18] <%Graxe_> I'd do 5
[2:45:22] <%bread_assassin> No, pick 4. That's meta;/
[2:45:24] <Djinnazz> 5
[2:45:26] <%GrassCannon> Are the baddies?
[2:45:26] <dinnydanny777> She's still red tho
[2:45:27] <snakemuho> I am Ze Bad Guy
[2:45:29] <+ChrisAlgoo> i'm the baaaaaaaadguy
[2:45:34] <%Reizie_Etherealm> 1 could potentially turn her back around, maybe
[2:45:34] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Hard 5
[2:45:36] <+kewlmyc> I just got back from a 30 minute meeting. We're still in this conversation boss battle?
[2:45:37] <%Graxe_> Sith yelling for the rest of her life
[2:45:37] <+evbites> death penelty
[2:45:39] <Archmortal> AND BILLIONS OF PEOPLE
[2:45:40] <%FallenAngelZelos> but FORGIVENESS
[2:45:43] <anita_dickin> also killed a planet
[2:45:47] <Joestar1890> Everyone deserves a second chance, BUT ya did alotta shit Atris
[2:45:49] <e3a4> Ask her to SMASH
[2:45:51] <Sapphire_Breeze> barely wrong LUL
[2:45:51] <+VCRUZZO> BARELY
[2:45:53] <%jepupu> Talk no Jutsu
[2:45:53] <dereks0n> Leave her here and it only gets worse
[2:45:55] <Joostebrood> I mean Fann has done some shady shit and that's not even going into the ingame slavery stuff.
[2:45:55] <+krispen_wa> DEW IT
[2:45:56] <+jiggy_snipe> death is not sufficient for her crimes
[2:45:56] <Shade075> Naruto all over again with Orocxhimaru
[2:45:58] <RantingRavager> REHABILITATE OR MURDER
[2:46:01] <lotharrio> Redemption is very Star Wars.
[2:46:01] <dinnydanny777> Woolie you killed a planet
[2:46:01] <ingman112> You’re essentially in a role reversal. After malachor, what did you deserve?
[2:46:05] <%alrobot2014> 4 is just fucking satisfying
[2:46:06] <+AMaidIndeed> Talk no jutsu!
[2:46:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> True Woolie is now
[2:46:08] <%spiritofmojave> I don't think she's COMING back from this
[2:46:08] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> 2
[2:46:10] <dinnydanny777> Fann killed a planet
[2:46:11] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus Whatever you pick, I got you
[2:46:13] <%GrassCannon> STEW IN IT
[2:46:13] <+toastybites> let her suffer
[2:46:13] <bethore> Woolie "Kill them all" Madden
[2:46:14] <+Feralspirit41> 4
[2:46:17] <Teras_ode> go back to your room
[2:46:17] <phatmac16> SIT DOWN
[2:46:17] <+Zanco23> I'd kill her, think you get some Kreia dialogue in your mind.
[2:46:19] <%Chisas_Dead_Body> 5
[2:46:21] <prince_johnny_> 4
[2:46:23] <Jmann9218> 5
[2:46:25] <prince_johnny_> Or 5
[2:46:26] <Enemy_In_Disguise> 5
[2:46:26] <dereks0n> She already is almost brought back, it's not like she doesn't know she fucked up
[2:46:30] <Joostebrood> Option 1 gives you the satisfaction of being the bigger man though.
[2:46:33] <phatmac16> KILL HER
[2:46:33] <Joestar1890> We should do a poll!
[2:46:35] <ingman112> 5 just means they kill her
[2:46:36] <Doodle_Taco> 4 or 5
[2:46:39] <+evbites> The differnce is atris killed innocents not mandos
[2:46:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> Little V, not only the physical strength, she does not have the MORAL strength to withstand Kreia or the Sith. We've SEEN that here.
[2:46:42] <%MrRabbles> option 1 is the Minh Dokapon move
[2:46:43] <+Zanco23> 6
[2:46:50] <heartlesshealer> Kreia steamrolled the council, Atris stands no chance at all
[2:46:52] <%Chisas_Dead_Body> !uptime
[2:46:52] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 47 minutes
[2:46:55] <olaksi> Don't listen to the Chat Holocron
[2:47:02] <%Reizie_Etherealm> My stance is if you have no willingness to reconsider that 2nd chance, if she can't coexist then she's not allowed to exist
[2:47:02] <%DSD24> She took your lightsaber
[2:47:06] <+evbites> remove this problem
[2:47:07] <+VCRUZZO> actually
[2:47:07] <$legacy0117> Why not just destroy all these Sith Holocrons and be done with it.
[2:47:08] <%Camail> she's been fallen for a long time
[2:47:13] <SixthSun2> oh my god, that room of holocrons is just chat
[2:47:15] <dereks0n> I mean she DID get the Sith out in the open Kappa
[2:47:18] <dinnydanny777> 4 would piss her off the most
[2:47:35] <%Camail> how much of _her_ was there while she chased glory
[2:47:35] <+VCRUZZO> @SixthSun2 lol Ah you got us!
[2:47:35] <Teras_ode> Force SMS
[2:47:39] <%DSD24> @SixthSun2 Sith Pogchamps all day
[2:47:40] <lotharrio> I think you know, actually?
[2:47:41] <%Reizie_Etherealm> :: Hissing from the Twitch chat ::

[2:52:29] <%ChoculaUltra> if you put like a table cloth over the holocron, does it get muted at all?
[2:52:30] <lotharrio> Break their ideals. Make them agree you're right. Shame them with your generosity. Humiliate them with redemption.
[2:52:34] <%GrassCannon> IZANAMI
[2:52:35] <dereks0n> You INFLUENCED her

[2:52:59] <brachydios777> Will that beacon thing be explained?
[2:53:01] <Too_Much_Nukie> It does though.
[2:53:04] <tolloponik> if not 10 good swings is all you need
[2:53:04] <Doodle_Taco> I would've left her trapped in there tbh
[2:53:10] <+theaceclaw> Atris then remained in the Jedi Academy, waiting to be judged for her actions by the new Jedi Council.
[2:53:10] <+krispen_wa> @brachydios777 it does get explained
[2:53:12] <Joostebrood> she is not iirc
[2:53:13] <snakemuho> they didn't have time for a whahappuns
[2:53:14] <lotharrio> @brachydios777 I think so, soon.
[2:53:15] <RedSqurrl> You can get her outfit lol
[2:53:15] <DatAsuna> She's not
[2:53:18] <+taku_toots> maybe it changes the color filter
[2:53:18] <dinnydanny777> If Apathy is death does Atris sitting in that room lead to her death
[2:53:19] <+ntfth> So, apparently there are files in the game indicating Atris was planned to be a party member instead of just ending here but 14 months.
[2:53:22] <%psydaku> nope
[2:53:23] <%Ashenik1> doest it matter?
[2:53:24] <resloxxx> @lotharrio that is one of the only punishments that bring satisfaction

[2:53:47] <+theaceclaw> SWTOR doesn't seem to like KOTOR 2 much

[2:54:13] <dereks0n> What from KOTOR 2 DOES get referenced in SWTOR?
[2:54:14] <%GiantPapaDoug> yeah most old republic stuff likes to ignore KOTOR 2 unfortunately
[2:54:18] <$TheFabledAble> Atris is literally "dark side later"
[2:54:27] <%GiantPapaDoug> even though it's easily one of the best stories out therr
[2:54:29] <Joostebrood> Exile gets to be stuffed into the fridge as Revan's ghost gf
[2:54:33] <+krispen_wa> @dereks0n the exile gets referenced for like 2 seconds in the worst cameo ever

[2:55:10] <Too_Much_Nukie> Originally they planned to have romances for every character iirc.
[2:55:12] <olaksi> Just because there's no harem ending doesn't mean you shouldn't try

[3:03:17] <%alrobot2014> hk has no computer use
[3:03:18] <%DSD24> @KidKame1 That would have been rad
[3:03:25] <%atema128> Yeah, just run past everything here, don’t fight.
[3:03:26] <+akikyou> This part of the game would've benefited from more work definitely
[3:03:27] <+krispen_wa> AND FOR GOOD REASON
[3:03:27] <+VCRUZZO> @KidKame1 true
[3:03:30] <ralphfromdk> For mostly good reason it sounds
[3:03:32] <%DSD24> Are we going to see why it was cut?
[3:03:39] <+wunp_fxs> i wished it stayed that way...
[3:03:39] <$StaceMcGate> oh boy, I came back to the stream for the worst dungeon
[3:03:44] <tolloponik> should have equip the super gun
[3:03:46] <Veteranhelldiver17> Ion weapons Woolie!
[3:03:49] <%christopherwpoindexter> @ashenik1 OMG I'm actually curious, wtheck, don't tell me there's actual M-rated redemption-banging between Fann and Atris...don't blueball me bro 😆😆
[3:03:50] <catwithsunglasses> from what I just saw, they were well within reason
[3:04:00] <grandark_z317> This is basically Omega's character arc from Sonic Heroes.
[3:04:00] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:04:00] <zocano> this damage is uh
[3:04:02] <zocano> not great
[3:04:07] <Joostebrood> oh
[3:04:08] <Maleicus> im almost sure thats t3 only
[3:04:09] <Joostebrood> i see what's wrong
[3:04:09] <lotharrio> I think it's T3 only?
[3:04:13] <+greatgetter> You need a better weapon
[3:04:16] <+Zanco23> Makes sense. The exile was heading to Darth Nihlus, and suddenly this random sequence is dropped on you out of nowhere. Screws with the pacing.
[3:04:16] <ingman112> Only T3 can use it
[3:04:17] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> Oh god do you have a better ion gun?
[3:04:17] <Joostebrood> they accidentally equipped a worse weapon
[3:04:19] <%GrassCannon> Switch your weapon, Woolie
[3:04:21] <Heyestus> why is he using the shit gin?
[3:04:24] <Joostebrood> switch the weapon
[3:04:31] <audibleellipsis> optimal accuracy ratio achieved
[3:04:32] <ralphfromdk> You really need to check that gun, somethiung seems off
[3:04:34] <+gochira> wrong rifle
[3:04:35] <+yunngin> This section didn't even appear in my playthrough wtf?
[3:04:36] <+VCRUZZO> but by this point you've already dedicated to the lightsaber you have by this point
[3:04:39] <Scrub_Seeker> does HK have his disintegrator equipped?
[3:04:39] <lotharrio> Do you have the right gun on, @WoolieVersus ?
[3:04:46] <catwithsunglasses> this stream becoming a podcast again, Lul
[3:04:47] <tuesti> this definitely should have been a different part of the game not so close to the end tbh
[3:04:49] <%DSD24> @yunngin This is cut content
[3:04:51] <%alrobot2014> is this the gun you made last session?
[3:04:51] <Katanas69> ION GUNS
[3:05:01] <subjectg> that’s not the disintegrator btw
[3:05:01] <+VCRUZZO> switch to something with Ion
[3:05:02] <+Zanco23> @yunngin Restored content mod
[3:05:03] <ralphfromdk> Check your gun, something seems off with the damage
[3:05:07] <vulkan_vibes> aratech ion pls
[3:05:08] <%christopherwpoindexter> also this is all new to me, I've only played Xbox O.G. version of this game, this entire section is like DLC goodies and extra icing on the top for me
[3:05:09] <%Camail> OH REALLY
[3:05:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> Alright, as I'm watchingthis and drinking, I'm diving into Helltaker, wish me luck boyos.

[3:05:49] <Veteranhelldiver17> Yay!
[3:05:53] <dinnydanny777> Use the Nadd blaster
[3:05:56] <blackskulldragon18> no wonder the damages were low
[3:05:56] <%christopherwpoindexter> that is literally worse than most other guns, objectively, not just because of damage types
[3:05:57] <vulkan_vibes> equip 2?
[3:05:57] <lotharrio> And is this the good one?
[3:05:57] <+VCRUZZO> @vulkan_vibes nice
[3:06:00] <Veteranhelldiver17> proper weaponry

[3:08:20] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> I've played the droid planet once, and it is one of the most painful things I've ever played through
[3:08:30] <%gatorafan> :: On a second thought, let's not go to the Droid planet, tis a silly place::
[3:08:38] <+ChronoaZ> You
[3:08:48] <%christopherwpoindexter> apparently a component-to-EXP vendor on droid planet helps u actually get Level 50 without exploits, maybe that's why the level cap is so damn high even in vanilla, maybe because it was designed with the droid planet in mind?
[3:08:49] <+gochira> the droid planet is where I stopped playing this game when I was a child
[3:08:56] <catwithsunglasses> Query: Nani the fuck?
[3:08:57] <+VCRUZZO> @gatorafan mm, agreed
[3:08:59] <subjectg> And imagine if you will, dual disintegrators with speed and rapid shot
[3:09:01] <Space_Pagan> Confused Query: The Fuck?
[3:09:03] <+ChronoaZ> You have a second disintegrator
[3:09:07] <Space_Pagan> LUL
[3:09:11] <%chiluzza> that bitch was sending HKs against us
[3:09:14] <%MaSterChiEfin420blntNinjA> I've only read an explanation of the droid planet and it sounded like an unfinished mess that didn't have enough content to flesh it out
[3:09:15] <+ntfth> They don't have dual wielding feats.
[3:09:15] <muniea3> you okay texture?
[3:09:25] <tuesti> @christopherwpoindexter that's interesting i didnt know that

[3:09:41] <lotharrio> Pockets sold it.

[3:11:01] <%christopherwpoindexter> @tuesti yea, I don't know if it explains Level 50 cap, but that's my theory based on the component-to-EXP vendor I've read about it, and you'd have to break down like EVERYTHING in your inventory, it may only go up to around level 46 anyhow. but it's still grinding, in a grind-y planet so I've read so 😕 still prob as much a slog as using exploits to get Level 50 in vanilla

[3:12:09] <Halospaz117> Does it just replace Korriban?
[3:12:16] <+krispen_wa> Korriban still exists
[3:12:19] <+krispen_wa> Just no vash
[3:12:24] <Halospaz117> ah
[3:12:28] <+akikyou> toasty
[3:12:34] <tuesti> @christopherwpoindexter i didn't know about the vendor even though i played it, i guess i was suffering so much i just wanted it to end
[3:12:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> In Retrospect, playing a puzzle game after half a bottle of wine may have not been a great idea.
[3:12:34] <aliceisneato> korriban tells you shes on the droid planet iirc
[3:12:35] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> You goto Koriban, and there is a datapad there that tells you Vash went to the droid planet
[3:12:40] <Halospaz117> Ah, yes, set the metal robot on fire, genius

[3:13:21] <zocano> It only gets worse, unfortunately
[3:13:21] <tuesti> @fandomgod i thought she gets killed on the way out of the droid planet?
[3:13:24] <zocano> This is the *easy* part
[3:13:25] <+fandomgod> She has an orange lightsaber I believe
[3:13:27] <%christopherwpoindexter> @tuesti that's so I've read, I've only played XBOX KOTOR 2, but I totally can imagine and sympathize with u,
[3:13:38] <+fandomgod> And no, she does join the Council

[3:14:57] <%christopherwpoindexter> it's funny, and in a way I'm really glad that restored content mod combat encounters are super random difficult spikes to make this game actually challenging for once for them
[3:15:01] <brachydios777> ResidentSleeper
[3:15:07] <+krispen_wa> The video I saw has her dying protecting you. And then you talk to the big AI droid guy asking why he did it

[3:17:59] <+Zanco23> Just because Disney acknowledges it doesn't mean it's canon. The KOTOR games have way to many contradictions to the current Disney canon anyway.

[3:19:59] <%hzflank> Revan was in a deleted scene in Clone Wars, but did not make the cut
[3:20:00] <dinnydanny777> Is Anakin canon?
[3:20:01] <tolloponik> they could have just took the name but left out the story I've seen it happen to other products
[3:20:02] <%christopherwpoindexter> let's just make new canon and turn that back into LEGENDS, and vice versa, bring old-ass Legends back into main canon. swap-a-roo. incredibly difficult, I'm sure, but possible
[3:20:04] <+doc_ock_rokc> But disney new shit isn't selling
[3:20:05] <%LordDukeFishington> Disney exploiting nostalgia for profit? No way
[3:20:07] <@Menitta> ITS SO STUPID
[3:20:07] <%netrac> Because god is dead
[3:20:09] <dinnydanny777> But is Anakin canon tho?
[3:20:12] <@Menitta> ESPECIALLY SINCE THE END OF THAT MOVIE
[3:20:16] <@Menitta> SHE MADE HER OWN
[3:20:16] <jamesthebrave> The real answer is to stop caring about the arbitrary canonicity of stuff, it doesn't affect the quality of the thing or the validity of you liking it
[3:20:17] <fuji_92> wait anakin's canon Kappa
[3:20:18] <+VCRUZZO> did not knowthat...I hate this planet
[3:20:22] <ingman112> She has her own goddamn lightsaber
[3:20:22] <+jiggy_snipe> and Anakin is canon tho?
[3:20:23] <%DSD24> Rey's Lightsaber 2
[3:20:24] <Joostebrood> I mean you probably shouldn't read more into it than there is. It's not as big a mess as Old Canon was but there's already like dozens of writers working on it and throwing in references cause like, they want to.
[3:20:26] <%spiritofmojave> @dinnydanny777 he's still Anakin in the original trilogy

[3:20:56] <%DSD24> Called out

[3:24:17] <+VCRUZZO> yeah

[3:24:21] <%mostly_simple> what!
[3:24:22] <+Zanco23> @dinnydanny777 Yeah, but you asked why didn't they make Jedi Knight canon.

[3:24:23] <%MaSterChiEfin420blntNinjA> That's true
[3:24:24] <%spiritofmojave> Yep Revan is a force ghost sorta
[3:24:24] <Texascourierlive> its cool
[3:24:25] <dinnydanny777> Revan is cool

[3:24:27] <+taku_toots> yep
[3:24:30] <%spiritofmojave> well Sith ghost
[3:24:31] <DatAsuna> but also that version of revan was a pure dark side entity with nothing else going on
[3:24:32] <+jiggy_snipe> legends are just dream matches right
[3:24:34] <prince_johnny_> oh yea
[3:24:37] <+doc_ock_rokc> @arkv01 Yeah Revan was a ghost for a scene
[3:24:37] <brachydios777> Wasn’t used though
[3:24:39] <PunkZedB> wish we got that instead of 4 episodes of clone rambo
[3:24:40] <fuji_92> it's cool tho
[3:24:40] <DatAsuna> It's unused because it was trash
[3:24:43] <+krispen_wa> Chris Avellone wrote Fallen Order, so they could easily get him back to write the Mary Sue version of Revan
[3:24:45] <dinnydanny777> @zanco23 Yeah but Legends is semi canon
[3:24:50] <knotsundownsyndrome> it was completely not what revan was
[3:24:56] <grandark_z317> @krispen_wa barf
[3:24:58] <Heyestus> Imagine wanting Star Wars to revisit the Old Republic considering how much they've been fucking everything else up lately.
[3:25:01] <+wunp_fxs> ...really?
[3:25:02] <%spiritofmojave> it was pretty bad deserved cutting tbh
[3:25:04] <%ChoculaUltra> every time someone talks about Clone Wars I always go "fuck, I need to check that out" but this Revan scene makes my dick get hard hard
[3:25:05] <+wunp_fxs> all this tch?
[3:25:05] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:25:07] <jamesthebrave> Does something being canon really matter all that much as long as it's good? It weirds me out how often the discussion of canon or not seems to override discussing the actual thing
[3:25:10] <%GiantPapaDoug> hell revan is in a SWOTOR expansion if i recall right?
[3:25:19] <%GiantPapaDoug> and he's pretty lukewarm there
[3:25:21] <grandark_z317> @heyestus blind optimism is disgusting
[3:25:25] <+VCRUZZO> its just dark side revan so they can use the look without the context
[3:25:26] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> OH YEAHHHHH
[3:25:26] <knotsundownsyndrome> @GiantPapaDoug he's a dungeon boss and then expac
[3:25:28] <%Reizie_Etherealm> *snap fingers* Upgrade! Upgrade right?! Upgrade!
[3:25:32] <+theaceclaw> they do revan dirty in SWTOR but Vitiate is awesome
[3:25:36] <+krispen_wa> @GiantPapaDoug We don't talk about the KOTOR parts of SWTOR
[3:25:37] <brachydios777> They didn’t use the scene cause they thought it was weird to use
[3:25:42] <Doodle_Taco> LUL
[3:25:43] <+VCRUZZO> best Wife
[3:25:46] <knotsundownsyndrome> but yes, SWTOR revan is not great either

[3:26:06] <tuesti> @jamesthebrave i mean i'd want it to be canon so i can get another game and more (good) content relating to the thing i like is the main reasoning
[3:26:08] <+CelebrityGhost> it's a black trenchcoat?
[3:26:11] <dinnydanny777> Neo cosplay
[3:26:14] <lotharrio> HK in a trenchcoat, let's go.
[3:26:15] <%Bluemanzee> Does it teach HK kung fu?
[3:26:15] <%ChoculaUltra> legit half of what I'll call the "Revan Arc" in swtor was decent, the other half was reaaaaaaaally bad fanfiction tier writing. Like that bad.
[3:26:17] <+VCRUZZO> *sigh*... @knotsundownsyndrome why you gotta remind me

[3:26:43] <%spiritofmojave> SWTOR Revan would've been a bit more of a compelling figure for that whole tangent Pat was going on about Darth Vader with. slightly, but it's easy for me to separate the two

[3:26:48] <%gatorafan> BECOME. MECHA.
[3:26:54] <%ChoculaUltra> to sum it up - there's a "good" Revan and a "dark" Revan in swtor. Do with that knowledge as you will.

[3:27:23] <%GrassCannon> triple damage on crits
[3:27:26] <%Shinny1338> That scene looks like Reboot lol
[3:27:28] <Maleicus> it disintegrates droids
[3:27:37] <%christopherwpoindexter> @jamesthebrave i mean, fair, at least, Legends means it's not completely decanonized, but it feels inferior to not being main canon
[3:27:40] <subjectg> 20-20 threat is pretty bad though
[3:27:41] <ingman112> And triple critical
[3:27:43] <lotharrio> HK is very dependent on Crit.
[3:27:47] <olaksi> Bioware used to be good at dumb but entertaining fiction, expecting SWTOR to live up to something like KOTOR2 was always unrealistic
[3:27:47] <%ChoculaUltra> anti-droid tech
[3:27:47] <fuji_92> x3 on crit
[3:27:52] <+VCRUZZO> @spiritofmojave that a fair enough statement on that comparison
[3:28:01] <brachydios777> How does chat feel about DAKKA?
[3:28:15] <+evbites> Moar DAKKA
[3:28:17] <naoi0> There can never be enough
[3:28:18] <%GiantPapaDoug> @olaksi i dont disagree but i still wanna complain cuz i got nothing better to do ;)
[3:28:19] <+wunp_fxs> But its 20-20 for the rifle
[3:28:22] <lotharrio> Right but HK has his native Feat that does percentile damage on Crits.
[3:28:24] <Prince_Robot> never enuff dakka
[3:28:25] <%ChoculaUltra> like ork dakka or berserk dakka
[3:28:26] <+jake5713> DAKKA.
[3:28:28] <subjectg> x3 but only 5% to crit
[3:28:29] <%Camail> Nah
[3:28:31] <%ChoculaUltra> either or, both are very very metal.
[3:28:34] <+VCRUZZO> @GiantPapaDoug well said
[3:28:36] <+VCRUZZO> lol
[3:28:37] <subjectg> so big no
[3:28:37] <%Camail> Not worth
[3:28:38] <+krispen_wa> You have a 25% chance to crit with critical shot
[3:28:38] <+SolidusRex> It has no crit range

[3:32:17] <+VCRUZZO> @spiritofmojave also as we know, most people in general just know and use the movies, cause they are always going to be canon over everything else
[3:32:22] <%GiantPapaDoug> Cuz im fucking down to shit on JK rowling

[3:35:17] <Doodle_Taco> "You WHACK"
[3:35:29] <Joostebrood> iirc isn't the original HK model that HK-47 was based on a Czerka brand model?
[3:35:33] <%spiritofmojave> is this generational racism?
[3:35:39] <surik_at> Age-ism
[3:35:40] <+Ixek> I'm JUST realizing that HK-47 is rusted.
[3:35:45] <wowowinsane> hk 47 is a boomer

[3:38:11] <+VCRUZZO> @spiritofmojave and its kinda unfortunate that the movies are the hard strict canon of SW, cause the sequels ended up contradicting its own material with it
[3:38:13] <dinnydanny777> :)
[3:38:14] <blackskulldragon18> wow
[3:38:14] <Heyestus> @Joostebrood I'm only going off what was in this and KotoR 1. Never bothered with anything else

[3:38:28] <+Zanco23> I feel sorry for HK's voice actor. He recorded all these lines, only for them to get cut.

[3:38:44] <%christopherwpoindexter> @zanco23 ditto
[3:38:47] <%ChoculaUltra> probably a silly question to ask but - does the HK line survive in some form to around Luke's time? Like is there an HK-100? HK-1000?
[3:38:48] <%GiantPapaDoug> sooo many lines of dialogue
[3:38:48] <Zantetzuken> i like the turning in unison
[3:38:48] <Joostebrood> @Heyestus tbh that might be a better approach than trying to square some of the shit in the extended universe.
[3:38:57] <%GiantPapaDoug> i feel sorry for all the VA's
[3:39:08] <%GiantPapaDoug> not to mention the writers
[3:39:08] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:39:10] <Heyestus> @Joostebrood Yeah it's not been leading me wrong so far.
[3:39:13] <%GrassCannon> Order 66 it
[3:39:25] <DatAsuna> The problem is it's a very distinct model of droid
[3:39:25] <dinnydanny777> Even the children?
[3:39:25] <%Javaa01> You can get a solid few, especially if they can't get a warning transmission out
[3:39:29] <%GiantPapaDoug> imagine writing this masterpiece only for it to not make the final cut
[3:39:30] <%christopherwpoindexter> @giantpapadoug same
[3:39:32] <Teras_ode> big cash in
[3:39:36] <lotharrio> I mean they have SOME sort of internet. So there's a strong chance a bit of word is getting out.
[3:39:37] <%spiritofmojave> @vcruzzo problematic part to it yeah, and entrusting the series to multiple writers and teams that have no coherent single vision for what they want out of BRAND.
[3:39:51] <grandark_z317> @giantpapadoug 14 months
[3:39:52] <%GiantPapaDoug> why did god of war 4 do well?
[3:40:08] <%christopherwpoindexter> @choculaultra don't give me hope 😆
[3:40:10] <Joostebrood> (KotOr Comics retconned this with HK-24)
[3:40:11] <%GiantPapaDoug> cuz they had a unified idea of what they wanted to be
[3:40:23] <brachydios777> @giantpapadoug Yep
[3:40:34] <%spiritofmojave> @giantpapadoug bingo
[3:40:47] <dinnydanny777> To be fair some of the extended canon is fricking weird, like Luke being a clo e
[3:40:50] <+oda_flobunaga> Atris sent the codes

[3:41:03] <%GiantPapaDoug> im the biggest fan of legends content
[3:41:09] <Joostebrood> yeah extended universe, particularly Old Canon, has some absolute nonsense
[3:41:13] <%GiantPapaDoug> but ill be the first to tell you. there was some duummb shit
[3:41:14] <brachydios777> Sequels should have been all jj or all Johnson, no inbetween

[3:41:50] <%ChoculaUltra> you can tell JJ and Johnson didn't even talk to each other between 7 and 8 LUL
[3:41:51] <%spiritofmojave> @brachydios777 least it'd be coherent, if nothing else that way
[3:41:55] <%christopherwpoindexter> @giantpapadoug it's like, some stuff is underrated and we wish became sequel movies or at least known to mainstream...but some stuff deserves to be forgotten or unknown
[3:41:56] <+Axelbr> but oh well
[3:42:02] <+Zanco23> @dinnydanny777 That's just a random clone that Mara kills, so she can get the Emperor's voice out of her head. It tells her to "kill Luke Skywalker", so she technically fulfills it.
[3:42:04] <Joostebrood> they could've done anything they wanted with the license but instead we got two retread films and one absolutely awful deconstruction
[3:42:17] <%GiantPapaDoug> the helicopter lightsabers anyone?
[3:42:21] <%GiantPapaDoug> Eh?
[3:42:28] <%GiantPapaDoug> Eeehhhhh?
[3:42:33] <dinnydanny777> @zanco23 I thought there was a story where he killed Luke
[3:42:33] <Joostebrood> don't start
[3:42:36] <fuji_92> huh
[3:42:43] <+Zanco23> @dinnydanny777 No
[3:42:43] <brachydios777> @giantpapadoug So stupid they were never used again
[3:42:56] <%ChoculaUltra> is it bad that I unironically think the inquistor heli-sabers are hilarious
[3:42:56] <arkv01> oopsies QA
[3:43:00] <%spiritofmojave> it was like him (capital H)
[3:43:15] <DatAsuna> @ChoculaUltra nah they are

[3:43:22] <DatAsuna> Pre
[3:43:42] <time_axis> It would have to be before, because you could have been light side in KOTOR
[3:43:42] <DatAsuna> Correct
[3:43:43] <subjectg> this is pre-malak betraying you
[3:44:34] <+VCRUZZO> @spiritofmojave *sigh* yeah, and thats why the sequels and coinciding material hurt so much. The thought of everything being consistent instead of the EU messy conections to its self was so...enticing for the sequels success for myself
[3:44:34] <+wunp_fxs> doesnt say meatbag. disgusting
[3:44:37] <tuesti> i have to say, i love watching woolie play and discuss everything thoroughly. i love good discussions
[3:44:45] <ralphfromdk> To be fair, Revan WAS the coolest of all the meatbags
[3:44:55] <dinnydanny777> Did Revan make the 50s?
[3:45:10] <surik_at> yes
[3:45:14] <+jiggy_snipe> HK was the prototype yes?
[3:45:38] <akman14> And with the starforge the only bottleneck is manpower , which droids could fill to some degree
[3:45:54] <%christopherwpoindexter> @rainphoon Statement: Revan is better than any other meatbag (droid prejudice aside).
[3:46:01] <DatAsuna> No? Not even a little. lol
[3:46:04] <dinnydanny777> You know I bet a HK army could kill a lot of Jedi
[3:46:10] <lotharrio> HK was the test model.
[3:46:10] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:46:11] <DatAsuna> Each of those stories was a different master and mindwipe.
[3:46:13] <surik_at> 47 never did return to Revan before his fall. so he decided to move forward with the next model @WoolieVersus
[3:46:14] <+Zanco23> @dinnydanny777 Yep, Revan made them.
[3:46:14] <$JonnyCue> POCKETTSSSSSS
[3:46:19] <+jiggy_snipe> yea that makes sense
[3:46:31] <+jiggy_snipe> HK was cool so he mass produced him
[3:46:47] <%christopherwpoindexter> * @ralphfromdk Statement: Revan is better than any other meatbag, droid prejudice aside.
[3:46:59] <%ChoculaUltra> "I love this guy! Let's make an army of him."

[3:47:11] <ingman112> That’s it, you asked everything
[3:47:14] <brachydios777> Good ol HKs
[3:47:19] <tuesti> the fact that Revan felt it was necessary to even replicate 47's personality because best bud
[3:47:26] <$BallerSwagBro9k> AH THE NEGOTIATOR
[3:47:26] <+jiggy_snipe> HK47 is just Megaman
[3:47:37] <%GiantPapaDoug> yo the star wars d20 tabletop books give you the option to play a droid character.
[3:47:38] <%christopherwpoindexter> Revan had Jedi AND HK factories?
[3:47:48] <%GiantPapaDoug> so you can totally play an hk droid if you want
[3:48:00] <ingman112> Reminder that the 50s have a “second master” who activated them
[3:48:09] <resloxxx> 400iq plays
[3:48:10] <%MrRabbles> Don't get it twisted if T3 was here this place would be devastated
[3:48:11] <+griffball13> THE COOLEST GIRL
[3:48:12] <Joostebrood> Avellone's writing of Revan does come across a tad masturbatory at times
[3:48:17] <dinnydanny777> Do you think Revan made them explode so they wouldn't betray him
[3:48:24] <fuji_92> POCKETS WAS THE COOLEST GAL
[3:48:29] <%ChoculaUltra> has the Star Wars EU ever dabbled in like, putting a sith or jedi brain into a droid body and having it use the force and shit yet
[3:48:35] <+jiggy_snipe> the force works in mysterious ways so she could manipulate time to get stuff done
[3:48:35] <muniea3> force clone no jutsu
[3:48:35] <phatmac16> THE COOLEST GUY
[3:48:50] <%spiritofmojave> @vcruzzo pretty much, though if I had to guess they thought that'd be retreading and playing it too safe to have one centralized team. I don't think I'd like it much more personally, but I hear you on that. the expanded stuff was always far more interesting
[3:48:53] <+oda_flobunaga> Darth McGuffin
[3:48:57] <ingman112> Communications console first
[3:49:05] <+ntfth> No, but they did do that with some kind of sapient crystal.

[3:49:38] <%spiritofmojave> if not yeah, super messy
[3:49:39] <Joostebrood> *accidentally stumbles on the answer*
[3:49:59] <dinnydanny777> You think older droids would be better than older droids by having more knowledge?
[3:50:02] <%SilvaChariot0133> LUL

[3:51:17] <%Javaa01> Downstairs in the other branch
[3:51:33] <Joostebrood> @christopherwpoindexter Droid Factory was cut much later in development, so it had all the voice acting done, a bunch of scripting, all the modelling, textures etc.
[3:51:39] <ingman112> Room on the right
[3:51:55] <Joostebrood> @christopherwpoindexter Droid Planet is much more of an original work - with all the consequences vis-à-vis quality that that entails
[3:51:57] <%christopherwpoindexter> @joostebrood oh, nice, gotcha, far closer to potentially being in the final game
[3:52:14] <fuji_92> HK Legends when
[3:52:15] <+Zanco23> This is much more chill than I thought. Considering how much the factory was hyped up.
[3:52:21] <%christopherwpoindexter> @joostebrood oh, yeah, like the girl in the Enclave, mostly fan interpretation

[3:56:17] <ovlarigalnea> SO THEN I STARTED BLASTING
[3:56:18] <%christopherwpoindexter> YES
[3:56:19] <+Fnir> He said it

[3:56:22] <prince_johnny_> LUL
[3:56:25] <resloxxx> LUL
[3:56:25] <%spiritofmojave> LUL
[3:56:25] <dinnydanny777> That HK was a bitch
[3:56:26] <%SilvaChariot0133> "What are you gonna do? Shoot me?"
[3:56:26] <Teras_ode> LUL

[3:56:42] <jamesthebrave> This is a really good filler episode
[3:56:43] <ralphfromdk> That... is a lot of health :o
[3:56:44] <Joostebrood> prepare to grind m8s
[3:56:46] <%christopherwpoindexter> THE REAL FINAL BOSS
[3:56:47] <Space_Pagan> So anyway, I started blasting
[3:56:49] <trickybird> V says GRIND again i'mma die
[3:56:55] <$BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[3:56:56] <%MrRabbles> they have too much health
[3:56:57] <%christopherwpoindexter> @trickybird RIGHT
[3:57:02] <DedlokPM> OPTIMAL ACCURACY RATIO ACHIEVED! rooSlain
[3:57:02] <fuji_92> "Ha, you can't kill me" - men who died
[3:57:05] <Ids560> why can they shoot you?
[3:57:06] <Joostebrood> there's like 9 of these guys in the last fight
[3:57:12] <trickybird> RIGHTTTT
[3:57:14] <%Javaa01> "What are you gonna do, stab me?" -Protocol Droid disabled by a bladed weapon
[3:57:14] <dinnydanny777> Self defence is allowed
[3:57:15] <%christopherwpoindexter> Actually difficult enemies
[3:57:15] <$Futurecity10> You can run from these guys
[3:57:17] <+gutlesscoward> OARA
[3:57:19] <lotharrio> Throw on another disintegrator/ripper pistol?
[3:57:21] <dinnydanny777> It's self preservation
[3:57:23] <ovlarigalnea> No gods or kings only HK
[3:57:25] <%MrRabbles> this is the point where i cheated and made HK god
[3:57:35] <+krispen_wa> Turn it to easy mode for this section
[3:57:39] <$Futurecity10> These guys have inflated health, and are the only ones with inflated health, you can run
[3:57:39] <$JonnyCue> Isn't it because he said is would no longer be one of them?
[3:57:50] <darthjjabrams> optimal accuracy ratio achieved
[3:57:51] <Joostebrood> R-A-T-I-O
[3:57:52] <sendart> yeah easy mode would be good
[3:57:55] <DedlokPM> OPTIMAL ACCURACY RATIO ACHIEVED! rooSlain
[3:57:55] <+griffball13> why are they not blowing up? should they have a bomb in them
[3:57:59] <+Zanco23> Yeah, easy mode's a good idea
[3:58:00] <Heyestus> They're probably permitted to disassemble "defective" units
[3:58:03] <%christopherwpoindexter> I mean it kind of makes sense, if 47 says no, then maybe the 50's echo that?
[3:58:08] <ovlarigalnea> 320
[3:58:08] <+griffball13> JESUS
[3:58:09] <Joostebrood> more advanced model woolie
[3:58:11] <%spiritofmojave> NICE CRIT

[3:58:19] <+ItsRatman> That's a spicy crit
[3:58:19] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Maybe they no longer recognize 47 as one of their own so they can shoot you now
[3:58:20] <+ntfth> monkaS
[3:58:20] <IvesNapalm> Good crit good crit
[3:58:20] <Mayachacha> fucking OOPS

[3:58:30] <brachydios777> Oh nooo
[3:58:30] <%memequisition> big crits
[3:58:33] <DarthFreeman> Delicious Crits
[3:58:37] <%GiantPapaDoug> they underestimate the power
[3:58:44] <Texascourierlive> BIG NUMBER
[3:58:50] <BliVru> @WoolieVersus Just to make this faster LOWER the difficulty
[3:58:50] <%christopherwpoindexter> KNOCKDOWN, that rarely happens
[3:58:51] <%GiantPapaDoug> of the assination protocols
[3:58:52] <AllTheZibas> Isnt that caused by HKs personal talent?
[3:58:55] <%christopherwpoindexter> 320?!?!?!??!
[3:59:04] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Unneccessary statement: OPTIMAL ACCURACY
[3:59:05] <+ItsRatman> so close to 420 :(
[3:59:08] <+Jasuchin> You ripped his fucking processor out with that shot! Holy shit!
[3:59:08] <%DorianCreed> @WoolieVersus Pretty sure it was a HK-specific super crit
[3:59:08] <+Zanco23> Not 420 :(
[3:59:09] <lotharrio> HK's got a unique Super Crits feat.
[3:59:13] <%christopherwpoindexter> @itsratman F
[3:59:15] <dmc5nero> whats your top 3 star wars games
[3:59:19] <Joostebrood> You were knocked down by Mira back in the apathy tomb.
[3:59:20] <Unicorngundam24> HK-47 sounds... underwhelming. I expected him to have a deep robotic voice.
[3:59:30] <dmc5nero> i hear alot of people love this game
[3:59:40] <%christopherwpoindexter> ESPECIALLY not to the player!!
[3:59:43] <brachydios777> @unicorngundam24 You never heard HK before this?
[3:59:44] <%Zohare> Usable by HK-47
[3:59:49] <naoi0> Yeah, this would definitely be my like top star wars game
[3:59:55] <GhostyTheSpook> It is fully upgradable at a workbench
[4:00:02] <%christopherwpoindexter> *exclusive weapon* 😕
[4:00:15] <%DorianCreed> @WoolieVersus Upgrade it, it hits harder base than the Mandalorian Disintegrator
[4:00:16] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:00:19] <GhostyTheSpook> even though it doesn't state it in the description
[4:00:21] <+Zanco23> @dmc5nero 1. KOTOR 1, 2. Jedi Academy, 3. Force Unleashed
[4:00:22] <+Jasuchin> It's just a Heavy Crossbow with some bonus feats
[4:00:27] <%DorianCreed> @WoolieVersus And it fits his existing Rifle Focus
[4:00:32] <Joostebrood> this game could give out 1/3rd as much loot as it does and it would still be too much
[4:00:47] <dmc5nero> @zanco23 the combat in jedi academy looks pretty great
[4:00:49] <Unicorngundam24> @brachydios777 I’m not old enough to appreciate SOME classics but I have a soft spot for Star Wars games like Force Unleashed and other shit.
[4:00:52] <%christopherwpoindexter> @joostebrood ^^^^^^^💯💯💯💯
[4:01:13] <+Zanco23> @dmc5nero Yeah, it's badass
[4:01:17] <+VCRUZZO> @Joostebrood SeemsGood SeemsGood SeemsGood
[4:01:29] <Heyestus> take 1/4 the damage from blaster fire - the armour
[4:01:31] <brachydios777> @unicorngundam24 HK is supposed to be a sarcastic killer, think a killer Bender
[4:01:38] <+Jasuchin> 3rd Edition Saving Throws limesLul
[4:01:41] <%DorianCreed> +5 is good at lower levels. At levels 20 or above, it's not so great
[4:01:42] <+Jasuchin> limesLUL
[4:01:42] <lotharrio> PRotects from knockdown, poison...
[4:02:02] <dmc5nero> @zanco23 like why hasnt that combat been in other games like the new battlefront 2 saber combat is terrible
[4:02:09] <%NopeBadguy> The Mugfugga
[4:02:10] <Daskolin> @WoolieVersus Fortitude = POISE from DS
[4:02:21] <dinnydanny777> Jedi Academy speedruns are nuts, because the game uses the Quake engine you can basically strafe jump through the story at 200 mph
[4:02:26] <+Jasuchin> Your hips also seem unshielded
[4:02:34] <%christopherwpoindexter> true story, I grinded for extra components and shit with Handmaiden thru my recent campaign in the game, I broke down everything I wasn't using at the last workbench at the very end of the game...and had 114,000 pointless components left over. needless to say, I def grinded too much
[4:02:55] <Joostebrood> time to fight, like 30-40 HK-50s
[4:02:57] <+Zanco23> @dmc5nero No idea. Fallen Order's combat can be fun though.

[4:07:06] <naoi0> PLease
[4:07:07] <naoi0> RUN
[4:07:14] <naoi0> WHO CARES
[4:07:17] <%christopherwpoindexter> at least Swoop Racing and Pazaak is still a good challenge
[4:07:17] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[4:07:25] <Matermind0> They can heal themselves too!
[4:07:25] <ovlarigalnea> Its a huge area, your not using hk again
[4:07:25] <+Bricespresso> let woollie try so we can see how op it is
[4:07:26] <Space_Pagan> ACTIVATE SONIC SPEED
[4:07:32] <derap41> What is he saying "ratio accieved" ?
[4:07:38] <ingman112> Make sure to send reminders to switch back once they’re done; I always forgot
[4:07:43] <Joostebrood> I mean, not everything needs to be spelled out to you.
[4:07:44] <naoi0> "Optimal accuracy ratio achieved."
[4:07:45] <lotharrio> @derap41 Because he's critting.
[4:07:45] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> @WoolieVersus You are no longer considered an HK
[4:07:45] <dereks0n> Month (14)
[4:07:49] <Halospaz117> I figure turning it off for HK went both ways
[4:07:50] <+oda_flobunaga> its because theis game is poorly written
[4:07:55] <brachydios777> @christopherwpoindexter To be fair, it doesn’t seem to be a game received as it is for its gameplay
[4:07:56] <+jiggy_snipe> I guess without his self-preservation protocol, he's no longer an "HK"
[4:07:57] <$JonnyCue> Doesn't he say that If he disables his self preservation that he wouldn't be like them anymore?
[4:08:05] <+oda_flobunaga> kappa
[4:08:08] <Joostebrood> Thing shoots at you > overwrites self-preservation for that thing' is a pretty logical progression
[4:08:11] <fuji_92> yeah, hk 47 is no longer an hk unit
[4:08:19] <+gochira> You are no longer an HK unit, so you dont activate their self preservation programming
[4:08:23] <%Javaa01> You turned off your limiters, and that means that you don't identify as one of them anymore
[4:08:24] <+MrMoonGoose> @derap41 'Maximum Accuracy Ratio Achieved' means he landed a crit
[4:08:27] <%Zohare> You're able to fire at them because you no longer consider yourself the same
[4:08:28] <%Javaa01> And they can shoot you
[4:08:28] <%spiritofmojave> oh no. my mechanical lungs, POISON
[4:08:33] <IvesNapalm> By taking out his self-preservation unit he isn't a KH unit
[4:08:33] <%christopherwpoindexter> @brachydios777 so it seems
[4:08:41] <Halospaz117> yeah this is just an exercise in tedium
[4:08:49] <derap41> @MrMoonGoose ah ok He says it so often he kinda talk over himself
[4:08:50] <anita_dickin> THEY HEAL NOW
[4:08:54] <anita_dickin> ?
[4:08:59] <%christopherwpoindexter> Influence Lost: Little V
[4:09:01] <+jiggy_snipe> now I see why people call this a slog
[4:09:14] <omegadarknes> Its simple math woolie, if there is an HK unit that threatens the existence of all the HK units then you need to eradicate it to fulfill your self-preservation programming
[4:09:17] <Dangerzone979> It's so weird how HK's spine isn't covered in the shield texture
[4:09:17] <brachydios777> They Heal now? They heal now
[4:09:17] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> Yeah this a wrap
[4:09:20] <IvesNapalm> 14 months, no time to balance out the section
[4:09:27] <derap41> Flying Clone Troopers
[4:09:28] <prime_name> Any big hopes for the Sony event tomorrow?
[4:09:32] <neilgilbertg97> no shit
[4:09:35] <+VCRUZZO> they've been around forever
[4:09:37] <+oda_flobunaga> since clone wars
[4:09:38] <+SinisterBroccoli> hell OG battlefront had jet pack troopers
[4:09:40] <dereks0n> Why isn't everyone flying in Star Wars
[4:09:52] <Space_Pagan> poison poison poison
[4:09:52] <naoi0> If (Shot_At) Self_Preservation == false;
[4:09:54] <brachydios777> Since the Republic Clone Troopers
[4:09:55] <Dangerzone979> Mandalorians do it better
[4:09:55] <Scrub_Seeker> flying storm troopers were in force unleashed
[4:10:04] <naoi0> "They were in the clone wars!"
[4:10:04] <+jiggy_snipe> @omegadarknes that also makes sense
[4:10:04] <IvesNapalm> They fly now?
[4:10:05] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I remember seeing them in both the Episode III game and force unleashed
[4:10:10] <naoi0> They fly now!
[4:10:13] <%Theycallmenerf> Dark Troopers people
[4:10:13] <DatAsuna> It's just a distinction between calling something good and calling it original
[4:10:22] <brachydios777> Wat?

[4:10:31] <%Double_Tap_That> Why was I built to feel PAIN!
[4:10:35] <+VCRUZZO> clone troopers units, stormtrooper units, droids, special units on planets
[4:10:36] <Dangerzone979> Also it makes sense that there would be Jet-Troopers, they were trained by Mandalorians
[4:10:37] <Joostebrood> Three
[4:10:38] <Ids560> 13?
[4:10:42] <Djinnazz> 64

[4:10:44] <Eger007> 7
[4:10:45] <%christopherwpoindexter> @dereks0n it makes Jango Fett an easy GOAT for me in the first LEGO Star Wars, because ONLY character with jetpack and dual pistols in that game

[4:10:49] <Augus7717> 420?
[4:10:51] <naoi0> Droid fetish roleplay
[4:11:09] <derap41> I thought it was 64 possible
[4:11:17] <ColbyBryant> 12
[4:11:22] <$BallerSwagBro9k> yup
[4:11:29] <ingman112> A key is a collection of notes
[4:11:31] <+MidnightBurst12> 12 unique notes in western music
[4:11:31] <brachydios777> Why we talking notes again?
[4:11:33] <%afronooch> octaves
[4:11:34] <lotharrio> Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti Do?
[4:11:35] <%SilvaChariot0133> LUL
[4:11:36] <coreyyotto> Its 64 if you count all octaves that humans can hear
[4:11:38] <derap41> Copyright those notes and own all music
[4:11:44] <%JohnAtDawn> Yeah that's why I don't really get it when an artist is allowed to sue another because it sounds similar. Like, dude we're gonna run out eventually
[4:11:47] <derap41> @coreyyotto ahok
[4:11:48] <+dragonzord12> i guess that explains the robo, never give you up connection
[4:12:07] <%GrassCannon> Why does he sound like he's about to laugh
[4:12:13] <$JonnyCue> THis voice actor sounds like he had so much fun doing these lines
[4:12:14] <+jiggy_snipe> cuz he is
[4:12:18] <coreyyotto> actually not even now that I think about it, just between bass range and six-string range there's gotta be more than 4 octaves

[4:14:42] <%christopherwpoindexter> just bringing up the rating, just as hypothetical if this stuff made the final game, makes me wonder how the rating may or may not have changed 😳

[4:14:54] <DedlokPM> OPTIMAL ACCURACY RATIO ACHIEVED! rooSlain
[4:15:13] <%christopherwpoindexter> at least this is original content from the game, not fan-made, AND more lore
[4:15:15] <%Javaa01> He's getting SO MUCH data on effective murdering of Protocol Droids, he loves it
[4:15:17] <Joostebrood> it's a wash because while it's good comedy and lore, it is awful, awful combat gameplay
[4:15:32] <brachydios777> @christopherwpoindexter No blood or sex or cursing so it A O K for the ratings board
[4:15:44] <%christopherwpoindexter> @brachydios777 basically

[4:17:01] <Halospaz117> I actually never had a locker outside of gym class
[4:17:03] <%GeneralSCPatton> He ran a soda hustle out of that locker
[4:17:07] <peanutdot007> How does V still have a back if he never used a locker
[4:17:08] <+SolidusRex> I never used mine, I hate using combination lockers
[4:17:11] <%LordSDB> I only used it if they forced me to use my locker
[4:17:19] <%FadingEmber> Woolie ran his scam out of his locker
[4:17:20] <+MrMoonGoose> @feralspirit41 That's a normal-sized HS locker
[4:17:25] <+krispen_wa> Never used a locker, back was fucked in HS
[4:17:26] <+Purple_badger3000> My school only let you rent lockers and they were too small to fit the textbooks in
[4:17:27] <CursedNobleman> Attons Jacet. Ribbed for his pleasure Kreygasm
[4:17:35] <+Zanco23> Jamoh was mentioned in KOTOR 1
[4:17:37] <CastellanVon> Never needed to use lockers. By the time I got out of highschool, the school gave us laptops.
[4:17:44] <%christopherwpoindexter> @joostebrood yea, you can really only optimize your inventory breakdown/sell for credits if you know where workbenches, lab stations are, when solo sections are, but first playthru or if u forget, then there's lots of filler in the inventory, or stuff you get locked out of using because someone else has it, or you lose access to vendors at this point
[4:18:14] <%christopherwpoindexter> so you can plan ahead...only if you know what's coming
[4:18:27] <+krispen_wa> Jeezus
[4:18:29] <%christopherwpoindexter> hence, I imagine, why the criticisms even at the original release
[4:18:37] <+ItsRatman> at least there's enough room to meditate

[4:26:41] <prince_johnny_> Damn
[4:26:42] <%christopherwpoindexter> I feel bad that I saw Twilek slaves in Return of the Jedi, the Twilek Jedi from the Clone Wars, didn't even know the name of the species until I started playing KOTOR 2
[4:26:42] <neffyavese> Man this voice acting top quality
[4:26:51] <+evbites> you have no class
[4:26:51] <%Pillagius> Well you see Wookies from a Planet, while Evoks are from the moon, since moon is much smaller than a planet - Wookies are larger than Evoks! All's super thought through!
[4:26:55] <brachydios777> Races?
[4:26:58] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Statement: this is the 16th time I've been told I am obsolete.
[4:26:59] <Zap_Rowsdower32> HK is an artiste
[4:27:00] <%GeneralSCPatton> @mrmoongoose I mean, in this galaxy that concept would barely exist.
[4:27:00] <Maydiz> @WoolieVersus you should watch the clone wars cartoonetwork animation.

[4:27:20] <DatAsuna> Go Right instead of left after this @WoolieVersus
[4:27:23] <ovlarigalnea> Its all about looking good
[4:27:25] <+jiggy_snipe> pretentious HK

[4:27:34] <DatAsuna> Do not use the left door
[4:27:43] <%christopherwpoindexter> @zap_rowsdower32. A FAILED artist 😏
[4:27:45] <akman14> Oh shit , V plays stellaris?
[4:27:46] <+evbites> Kill all organics

[4:27:59] <%christopherwpoindexter> holy shit the Droid sith lords
[4:28:03] <$JonnyCue> This kinda looks like the final boss room from KOTOR 1
[4:28:03] <%LordSDB> 8 vs 1
[4:28:07] <olaksi> Kill all humans, kill all humans!
[4:28:09] <+PlagueOfGripes> Propagate THIS
[4:28:24] <+krispen_wa> So if you don't do the Restoration Mod, the galaxy is FUCKED
[4:28:27] <jamesthebrave> HK on some Hakaider shit right now
[4:28:28] <brachydios777> Kill the meatbags basically
[4:28:31] <Jandersmvp> i always just run from this room
[4:28:34] <+jiggy_snipe> he would be offended by "his kind"
[4:28:35] <derap41> So HK turned into the Necrons
[4:28:37] <%GeneralSCPatton> In this galaxy, people from a sand planet would discover forest planets and ocean planets, and not have a word for the concept of other environments, or different environments within a world.
[4:28:37] <+MidnightBurst12> universal extermination
[4:28:38] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Smug statement: with this amount the odds are even.
[4:28:39] <Shade075> UNIVERSAL extermination
[4:28:42] <$JonnyCue> Bender would be proud
[4:28:42] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1270228062764969985
[4:28:47] <surik_at> @WoolieVersus would you like to guess the model of a droid responsible for the biggest and deadliest droid uprising in galactic history?
[4:28:51] <LunarRemix> And the funny thing is that no Jedi could ever predict it because droids lol
[4:28:52] <+Feralspirit41> The mandalorians would probably be duper into it
[4:28:56] <time_axis> I wonder if the Jedi would even sense that threat, since they cant sense droids
[4:29:12] <+oda_flobunaga> SP@RT1CU5
[4:29:12] <+Zanco23> So basically, he's IG-88?
[4:29:18] <derap41> The art is in the doing
[4:29:18] <brachydios777> @feralspirit41 Can’t fight anything when everyone is dead
[4:29:21] <Joostebrood> imagine this fight if they hadn't changed the difficulty setting
[4:29:21] <%Javaa01> O P T I M A L wooliePOYO
[4:29:22] <$JonnyCue> @time_axis Not until organics started dying
[4:29:40] <dinnydanny777> Pew pew
[4:29:43] <dinnydanny777> pew
[4:29:44] <silverira> OPTIMAL ACCURACY RATIO ACHIEVED
[4:29:47] <DatAsuna> I like the idea of assassinating economies more personally
[4:29:55] <+Zanco23> WHAT?!!
[4:29:57] <%christopherwpoindexter> philosophical dialogue fights with droids...that's amazing
[4:30:04] <+OnwardEch0> BUMP IT TO NORMAL
[4:30:05] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> imagine getting knocked over when they can crit you
[4:30:06] <time_axis> @JonnyCue So the galaxy would be pretty fucked if they waited for their numbers to be unstoppable before striking in full.
[4:30:08] <snakemuho> Woolie just mashing LUL
[4:30:12] <Zap_Rowsdower32> I just used an invincibility mod for the whole game
[4:30:18] <+PlagueOfGripes> these games have quite the combat system huh
[4:30:23] <Space_Pagan> beep beep beep beep beep
[4:30:24] <Zap_Rowsdower32> KOTOR combat ain't hood
[4:30:26] <Zap_Rowsdower32> *good
[4:30:30] <$JonnyCue> @time_axis Agreed
[4:30:30] <ovlarigalnea> Ah Woolie showing that Pat tech
[4:30:34] <%GiantPapaDoug> is that the plague
[4:30:37] <Damie904> Is Woolie still on ez mode?
[4:30:38] <dinnydanny777> The rest of the galaxy is just dumb, why don't they just turn easy mode on ahaha
[4:30:47] <Matermind0> Ah, the wonders of 3.5e
[4:30:47] <%christopherwpoindexter> @zap_rowsdower32 yea...
[4:30:53] <+Zanco23> Yeah, in general I just cheat my way through RPGs, cause I just want the story.
[4:30:53] <$JonnyCue> @Zap_Rowsdower32 it's technically based on like a D&D combat model
[4:30:53] <Chatterbox1991> +
[4:30:53] <brachydios777> I don’t think most of us are here for the gameplay
[4:30:58] <dinnydanny777> Defeat the Empire by turning on Easy Mode
[4:31:00] <%GiantPapaDoug> modified 3.5 edition rules
[4:31:13] <+VCRUZZO> @Zap_Rowsdower32 nah you had it right. It ain't hood. This combat is not cash money people
[4:31:21] <G3neralRevan> aha the modded version
[4:31:26] <lotharrio> Well it's based on Star Wars D20, I'm pretty sure.
[4:31:27] <Space_Pagan> UH OH
[4:31:32] <Zap_Rowsdower32> D&D style combat is the main reason why a lot of old WRPG combat sucks to be honest.
[4:31:32] <dinnydanny777> Nah we have easy mode on, it's fine
[4:31:33] <%GiantPapaDoug> if you guys look up the star wars saga d20 rulebooks you'll see the full system
[4:31:46] <Zap_Rowsdower32> And I do enjoy a bunch of them just in spite of their combat
[4:31:47] <surik_at> DETERMINED EXTERMINATORS
[4:31:48] <brachydios777> Oh , that’s alot of Robits
[4:31:49] <+oda_flobunaga> they would survive the death of the force too
[4:31:51] <%Javaa01> Transmit that killswitch and crack the planet with how many of these things will blow up at once
[4:31:53] <austinj24> Blow it all up
[4:31:54] <Ids560> I'm glad Revan's just chilling while 2 galaxy ending threats are happening
[4:31:54] <%GiantPapaDoug> but it is ultimately a modified 3.5e core systen to work in the star wars universe
[4:31:55] <$BallerSwagBro9k> THIS IS A KROGAN LEVEL THREAT
[4:32:08] <brachydios777> CIS stuff going on here
[4:32:08] <dinnydanny777> This is like the clone centre on Kamino but worse
[4:32:10] <naoi0> Fuck this place
[4:32:12] <Zap_Rowsdower32> +4 to killing
[4:32:12] <time_axis> oh, I thought those were unique to SWTOR
[4:32:18] <+PlagueOfGripes> "Increase production"
[4:32:24] <ingman112> Don’t do that yet!!!!!
[4:32:27] <dinnydanny777> Is it murder to kill a HK
[4:32:29] <+Zanco23> Hypocrites
[4:32:35] <naoi0> GOD DAMNIT
[4:32:45] <dinnydanny777> If a HK is sentient is killing one murder
[4:32:46] <+VCRUZZO> the 51's will not replace us!
[4:32:50] <the38bandit> Wasnt revan captured in unknown space at this point?
[4:32:54] <$JonnyCue> What were they supposwed to do?
[4:32:58] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Which is worse, mass force snuff or mega mechanized invasion?
[4:32:59] <+WutangchickeN> A wild Plague appears
[4:33:00] <+VCRUZZO> god damn it
[4:33:07] <+oda_flobunaga> save
[4:33:22] <+MrMoonGoose> Little V is handling that whisky like a champ
[4:33:28] <%GiantPapaDoug> @plagueofgripes when are we gonna get the lewd Hk art?
[4:33:35] <DatAsuna> It fixed a lot, but not as much as you'd hope
[4:33:45] <time_axis> can confirm, that part was really hard for me
[4:33:46] <+oda_flobunaga> HK-Chan
[4:33:47] <ingman112> There’s plenty it fixed but it’s not perfect
[4:33:56] <brachydios777> @jonnycue They were suptto be assasins for Revan but they became somewhat sentient and it got out of hands
[4:33:56] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Restored Content actually gives this game an ending
[4:33:58] <prime_name> "Statement: System's Honry, master~."
[4:33:58] <+doc_ock_rokc> @GiantPapaDoug that implies any kind of art of HK isn't lude
[4:34:04] <Joostebrood> particularly on Nar Shaddaa, TSLRCM addas a whole bunch of trash mobs in a game that's already heavy on trash mobs
[4:34:37] <%Javaa01> And remember, it was 2004, so you couldn't just fix things by shipping a day one patch
[4:34:37] <dinnydanny777> This could have been the "chapter 13" from FFXV that everyone hated from another point of view though
[4:34:39] <$JonnyCue> @brachydios777 Oh I meant why everyone was saying "Don't do that yet" kind of thing
[4:34:41] <%christopherwpoindexter> @prime_name hmm
[4:34:54] <brachydios777> @jonnycue Oh ok
[4:35:10] <%GiantPapaDoug> @doc_ock_rokc good point. im sure the thought of squeezing the trigger of his blaster carbine while the barrel is pointed behind a meatbag diplomat's skull gets his gear well oiled

[4:36:28] <time_axis> maybe these ones aren't done yet
[4:36:28] <Joostebrood> i mean, this content genuinely gets difficult. But playing as Exile the difficulty is just genuinely borked past level 20 just because of imbalanced lightsabers, master speed & lightning.
[4:36:36] <+griffball13> maybe they are just deativated when in the base

[4:36:46] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @MrMoonGoose
[4:36:48] <surik_at> They can't do that in factory or near other HK?
[4:37:16] <%christopherwpoindexter> good call V

[4:42:46] <%Ghostbody> Asuna being the hero we need
[4:42:46] <%Mekhet09> it changes the ending V.
[4:42:46] <+SolidusRex> V is wrong
[4:42:47] <+Flambage> @WoolieVersus This changes the ending a lot
[4:42:48] <$JonnyCue> THE UNIVERSE IS SAYING IT MATTERS
[4:42:53] <lotharrio> ...alright well it changes a thing but Asuna is apparently on top of it?
[4:42:55] <DatAsuna> It's not important for endgame, the bad end only happens by not doing the factory at all

[4:45:12] <DatAsuna> @gammongaming11 you beat g0t0 nyway with different dialogue, g0t0 only wins if you didn't get hk-47s dialogue to unlock the factory
[4:45:14] <ShiningAxis> So much for the HK army
[4:45:15] <gammongaming11> @GabeSweetMan depends on what you define as major, it literally prevents a character death.
[4:45:16] <dinnydanny777> Cybertron
[4:45:20] <%christopherwpoindexter> i guess we hope @datasuna can show us what the other stuff was
[4:45:20] <snakemuho> and that one part is gonna be infinitely less interesting now FeelsGoodMan

[4:50:33] <RantingRavager> PUT IT IN THE OVEN
[4:50:33] <candidateplays> So if you don't unlock the Hk factory, you can select Bao-dur
[4:50:34] <+SolidusRex> Bao Dur was supposed to die to get him in the factory
[4:50:35] <+Feralspirit41> HK also left the party, much like kreia
[4:50:35] <+ntfth> 14 months.
[4:50:37] <%spiritofmojave> there was a Bao here. he's gone now.
[4:50:39] <SixthSun2> Where's Mando?

[4:51:10] <Joostebrood> ECHO
[4:51:11] <+VCRUZZO> this is super unfortunate
[4:51:12] <Heyestus> In the original version Bao-Dur is not selectable after this point, there are some things that allude to why this is in the endgame but nothing truly concrete @WoolieVersus

[4:51:51] <dereks0n> He's only an echo now
[4:51:53] <%hzflank> There's a little context later
[4:51:53] <+kewlmyc> Sure , let's go with that
[4:51:53] <arkv01> bao dur was a good boy...
[4:51:56] <%yeildingthought> LUL
[4:51:56] <snakemuho> Chris
[4:51:56] <+RJay80> 🦀 cant believe bao dur is fucking dead 🦀🦀
[4:51:57] <peanutdot007> Araki Forgot
[4:51:58] <%spiritofmojave> how would we know that Chris
[4:51:58] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus Chris posted it on the obsidian forums
[4:51:59] <startstoprepeat> avellone
[4:51:59] <dinnydanny777> He got killed by splash damage
[4:52:02] <%bigmacjack12> Woolie don’t pay attention to chat
[4:52:05] <+evbites> our padawan
[4:52:06] <%bigmacjack12> It’s lies
[4:52:08] <Doodle_Taco> Yeah I think
[4:52:08] <+doc_ock_rokc> @WoolieVersus Yes avellone said it in an interview
[4:52:09] <+oda_flobunaga> @WoolieVersus factory section is a two character run, Avallone said so
[4:52:10] <dinnydanny777> Bao Dor killed by explosion splash damage
[4:52:10] <the38bandit> moon2PH
[4:52:11] <%bigmacjack12> All will be revealed
[4:52:11] <%Xalgar> Killed by Fart Gas
[4:52:11] <%Reizie_Etherealm> @peanutdot007 LUL
[4:52:12] <%MrRabbles> how could Chris do this
[4:52:14] <$JonnyCue> Yes, Avellone said he was indended to die at telos
[4:52:14] <derap41> the Devolopers kinda forgot about Bao-dur
[4:52:18] <+Ancopro> meatbag
[4:52:18] <surik_at> @WoolieVersus Chris couldn't even concretely confirm an EXTREMELY important Kreya fact.
[4:52:21] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> "In an interview, Chris Avellone stated that Bao-Dur was intended to die during the Battle of Telos IV, while helping HK-47 reach and shut down the HK Manufacturing Plant." From the Wookiepedia
[4:52:22] <%christopherwpoindexter> we'll see a hologram of Bao later at least in vanilla, but that's it
[4:52:22] <Heyestus> @WoolieVersus in the OG version for xbox-huge Bao-Dur is actually selectable in this section but disappears from the party shortly afterwards
[4:52:25] <%Javaa01> Or more specifically, he was SUPPOSED to die there, but it doesn't exist in the game, even in what was able to be restored
[4:52:26] <$GabeSweetMan> That's.... unbelievably shit.
[4:52:29] <arkv01> splash damage LUL
[4:52:30] <$BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[4:52:31] <%emperordread> He pulled a Poochie and returned to his own planet
[4:52:34] <%spiritofmojave> BAO'S LIKE THE BEST TOO
[4:52:34] <DatAsuna> The hard confirmation is literally a dev account on the forum @WoolieVersus
[4:52:34] <snakemuho> 14 months finally catching up to Woolie
[4:52:35] <%psidefx> TOP SHIT
[4:52:36] <+RJay80> splash damage??? DAMMIT
[4:52:39] <shutupandjam3465> yeah it blows
[4:52:40] <%MrRabbles> death isn't canon if not in game
[4:52:40] <privatesargent> 14 months
[4:52:42] <+WutangchickeN> Bao died in an explosion, but really survived and got ghosted away by a helicopter to take part in spin-off movies.
[4:52:46] <$GabeSweetMan> He's such an amazing character. What an INJUSTICE.
[4:52:48] <+oda_flobunaga> The game is just soooo poorly written, ya know Kappa
[4:52:49] <DatAsuna> Chris is a verified account
[4:52:49] <%Garthunox> welcome in 14 months
[4:52:51] <shutupandjam3465> bao dur is so interesting hes just basiucally unfinished
[4:52:52] <megamonmon123> please nerf splash damage
[4:52:56] <+vaporousTippler> Imagine Bao Dur, but everyone.
[4:52:56] <+Shadicara> FEEL YOUR HATE WOOLIE Kappa
[4:52:58] <phatmac16> "In an interview, Chris Avellone stated that Bao-Dur was intended to die during the Battle of Telos IV, while helping HK-47 reach and shut down the HK Manufacturing Plant" from wookiepedia
[4:53:01] <Doodle_Taco> Bao became a ghost
[4:53:03] <$BallerSwagBro9k> THE PAIN WEVE HAD FOR 16 YEARS
[4:53:03] <Joostebrood> I mean in the base game i always kind of assumed Bao-Dur died in the crash at Malachor V.
[4:53:08] <%Shinny1338> There is a WOUND in the force
[4:53:11] <+JustToWatch> Bao Dur is chilling on a beach with Launch
[4:53:12] <+doc_ock_rokc> Granny wants Grandkids
[4:53:16] <$TheFabledAble> FYI there is a big dialogue monologue sequence with HK at the end of the factory level you guys missed. V was wrong that activating hk 51s was minimal. Unless you do that, you miss out on a big important HK-47 Scene
[4:53:19] <+PlagueOfGripes> reminds me of Nauls wandering off screen at the end of The Thing, because the scenes where he died was cut, so they had to get rid of him
[4:53:19] <terramagus> "Hey, remebmer when we said you had 18 months to make the game? SUrprise fuckers, it's 14 months! Have it done by next week."
[4:53:21] <%christopherwpoindexter> I thought The Last Jedi was full of disappointment as a motif...but that wasn't as well executed
[4:53:23] <shutupandjam3465> the fact this got released in the first place is astonishing
[4:53:23] <candidateplays> Oh, you have no idea
[4:53:23] <+krispen_wa> the bubble pops at endgame
[4:53:24] <%Xalgar> Bao-Dur succumbed to fart gas :)
[4:53:27] <lotharrio> I found Avellone's blogpost about Bao Dur. It's pretty short regarding that specific thing.
[4:53:28] <dereks0n> We have entered Month 14
[4:53:29] <dinnydanny777> Mandalore is going back to his home planet now?
[4:53:31] <candidateplays> This is nothing
[4:53:34] <Doodle_Taco> Hey he said good catch on THAT theory so maybe
[4:53:39] <%MrRabbles> Bao Dur and Remote are gone but not forgotten
[4:53:40] <Joostebrood> you don't have to miss Mandalore long
[4:53:46] <%psidefx> Bao-dur is with Tien's career
[4:53:47] <phatmac16> "In an interview, Chris Avellone stated that Bao-Dur was intended to die during the Battle of Telos IV, while helping HK-47 reach and shut down the HK Manufacturing Plant" from wookiepedia
[4:53:48] <+oda_flobunaga> I seem to remember Bao stuff on Malachor V though
[4:53:48] <ingman112> Remote ain’t gone
[4:53:50] <Joostebrood> Remote ain't gone though
[4:53:55] <+MrMoonGoose> It's on the Wiki, he was supposed to die. I totally don't remember this
[4:53:58] <+evbites> like the predator
[4:53:58] <dereks0n> YEYEYEYE
[4:54:03] <%christopherwpoindexter> Remote will show up at least
[4:54:04] <%notgarza> NooOoOo
[4:54:04] <$TheFabledAble> @oda_flobunaga dont spoil that
[4:54:05] <surik_at> @TheFabledAble it seems V doesn't really like the ending it creates Kappa
[4:54:06] <Joostebrood> there is Bao-Dur stuff on Malachor
[4:54:06] <+evbites> BAO
[4:54:07] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> Like a badass
[4:54:07] <prime_name> THE GAME IS FALLING APART
[4:54:07] <Retinolgaming> NOOOOOOOO, the cool ones
[4:54:09] <$BallerSwagBro9k> MYSTERIOUS VOICE: NOOOOOOOO
[4:54:10] <Joostebrood> just no living Bao-Dur
[4:54:10] <dinnydanny777> I miss Bao Dor
[4:54:14] <%bigmacjack12> Chat needs to stop wildin, there’s more to come
[4:54:14] <%Shinny1338> Wound in the force
[4:54:18] <lotharrio> Mods, am I allowed to post a link to Obsidian's blogposts?
[4:54:21] <%psidefx> B R E A K D O W N
[4:54:22] <brachydios777> Nooooooooo!
[4:54:25] <+WutangchickeN> It's like the second disc of Xenogears all over again carciYOWL carciYOWL carciYOWL
[4:54:28] <+VCRUZZO> ummm
[4:54:30] <+krispen_wa> ...
[4:54:31] <+oda_flobunaga> It's been years since I've played it so my memory is spotty
[4:54:31] <%MrRabbles> Bao Dur is on the farm
[4:54:32] <%spiritofmojave> HOES MAD
[4:54:33] <+taMsaN> LUL
[4:54:34] <%GrassCannon> BEST GIRL NOOOOO
[4:54:35] <%christopherwpoindexter> No he's not
[4:54:40] <prince_johnny_> pain
[4:54:43] <DatAsuna> Too spoilery, V
[4:54:44] <+doc_ock_rokc> Best droid is still here
[4:54:45] <endarren> Yeah... about that... Remote is still here
[4:54:46] <+PlagueOfGripes> prepare to be upset
[4:54:46] <$TheFabledAble> @surik_at considering how he worded he reasoning I doubt he remembers
[4:54:46] <dinnydanny777> Is it? Isn't that just even weirder
[4:54:47] <%bigmacjack12> Vs lyin rn chat, y’all need to chill
[4:54:48] <peanutdot007> Think of the rabbits Bao Dur
[4:54:50] <Ids560> that's almost sadder
[4:54:50] <%Zohare> Remote impression was pretty spot on
[4:54:53] <+oda_flobunaga> playthrough over?
[4:54:54] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Bitter End
[4:54:55] <+aishman> Sorry I had to take care of things, what happened to Bao?
[4:54:57] <%spiritofmojave> If we lost that Remote beat I'd be extra depressed
[4:54:58] <%Shinny1338> This game's ending is a wound in the force
[4:54:59] <$GabeSweetMan> Remote is Orphaned.
[4:55:01] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> What kinda bullshit, how is Remote not gone?
[4:55:02] <ingman112> Remote ain’t gone
[4:55:03] <Joostebrood> V cucked us out of HK-51 content
[4:55:04] <+VCRUZZO> wish he was able to learn that one himself
[4:55:05] <%psidefx> ye T3 is here lonoKEK
[4:55:06] <%christopherwpoindexter> Remote will return in the next Avengers
[4:55:07] <endarren> @PlagueOfGripes Yep. Prepare for upset
[4:55:07] <$JonnyCue> UNTIL THE KOTOR REMAKE
[4:55:07] <%Irridium> @aishman he gone
[4:55:08] <megamonmon123> never addressed, never explained
[4:55:10] <DatAsuna> Oh boy we're only here for first stream?
[4:55:10] <Jandersmvp> **Echoes**
[4:55:11] <%MrRabbles> Godot adopts Remote
[4:55:13] <dinnydanny777> That sucks
[4:55:14] <KnivesEve> so wait bao just gone?
[4:55:16] <%Garthunox> @joostebrood calm down
[4:55:17] <dinnydanny777> That just sucks
[4:55:18] <AvoidingTheCoronaVirus> this is the restored version yeah?
[4:55:20] <WanderingSwordsman> That's it, unsubscribing from Super Bunny Hop
[4:55:20] <surik_at> @TheFabledAble he literally crouched in front of camera and slowly shook his head Kappa
[4:55:20] <dinnydanny777> Owch
[4:55:21] <DatAsuna> This is gonna run super late if we only start stream 2 here
[4:55:21] <+WutangchickeN> The remote is replaced by a beatboxing Salacious Crumb
[4:55:22] <tranquilturnip> what was the blow? I missed it
[4:55:25] <%christopherwpoindexter> this music weirdly fits
[4:55:27] <+oda_flobunaga> ECHO ECHO ECHO ECHO ECHO ECHO ECHo
[4:55:29] <%notgarza> Ending (B)lasted Off
[4:55:33] <+VCRUZZO> @DatAsuna yeah
[4:55:36] <$TheFabledAble> @WoolieVersus yall should watch the alternate end for the Factory, because it has an amazing monologue
[4:55:38] <dinnydanny777> Character select is now not available
[4:55:41] <ingman112> Why the fuck you lyyyyyin
[4:55:45] <Space_Pagan> Hey, maybe Bao-Dur will come back in KOTOR 3!! ...Uh.
[4:55:49] <$GabeSweetMan> The closest and MOST INTERESTING of any character!
[4:55:50] <%bigmacjack12> Chill guys chill
[4:55:54] <olaksi> This might be my top 3 games that need a remake
[4:55:55] <Joostebrood> @Garthunox i'm not upset, just messin around
[4:56:01] <Joostebrood> cool vibes
[4:56:01] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> @tranquilturnip Bao-Dur is no longer in ht e game due to 14 months, and it's never explained
[4:56:04] <wowowinsane> the kotor 2 sad times
[4:56:06] <shutupandjam3465> woolie dont get it wrong bao durs character isnt over yet even though hes dead
[4:56:09] <dinnydanny777> Is he even mentioned in TOR?
[4:56:11] <lotharrio> Mods, can I post a link to Avellone's blog that (briefly) explains what happened to him? (not safe for Woolie)
[4:56:13] <%Xalgar> Bao-Dur succumbed to Nar Shadda fart gas :)
[4:56:15] <+oda_flobunaga> ECHO
[4:56:15] <%psidefx> He's just getting milk]
[4:56:17] <Heyestus> Gggame ain't over yet
[4:56:19] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I'm being strung along on this adventure and I feel like the path got split down so many different roads I'm not sure which one to pay attention to
[4:56:20] <tranquilturnip> @chiazamformerlymankeyfigh damn, thanks tho
[4:56:23] <Joostebrood> There's a 'Bao-Dur science prize'
[4:56:24] <+oda_flobunaga> ECHO ECHO ECHO
[4:56:26] <+SolidusRex> "Why are they burying daddy?"
[4:56:29] <%notgarza> Bye Woolie
[4:56:32] <SquigglyLizard> woolie needs to go for a walk LUL
[4:56:32] <+Feralspirit41> God willing we meet Bao-Dur again in KOTOR3; The search for more money
[4:56:33] <%SilvaChariot0133> Bye
[4:56:38] <DatAsuna> @dinnydanny777 no, swtor just runs with the version of malachor we got and bao dur died without heirs.
[4:56:39] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @solidusrex oh god LUL
[4:56:39] <phatmac16> how much longer until the end, chat>
[4:56:42] <akman14> If they didn't show his death, why even remove him?

[4:56:47] <$GabeSweetMan> KREIA WON
[4:56:48] <%psidefx> The hoes are INDEED mad
[4:56:48] <+kewlmyc> LP cancelled
[4:56:48] <dereks0n> A WOUND
[4:56:51] <%christopherwpoindexter> this is like PTSD denial "no, dad's at the store, he'll be back tonight"
[4:56:51] <ingman112> God just play the game without spoiling this shit
[4:56:53] <%Binary_Fireball> EMBRACE YOUR ANGER
[4:56:55] <dinnydanny777> Well the force sure got pulled out of Bao Dur
[4:56:57] <$GabeSweetMan> Hoes Won Hoes Won Hoes Won
[4:56:57] <StarlitStunner> Echoes of Bao

[4:56:58] <%MaSterChiEfin420blntNinjA> sbfpDattebayo
[4:56:59] <+PlagueOfGripes> You allowed your emotions to rule you, Woolie
[4:57:00] <Teras_ode> Woolieatrisk
[4:57:00] <arkv01> his midochlorians are GONE
[4:57:01] <Retinolgaming> WOOLIE LIGHTSABER GO RED
[4:57:02] <+JustToWatch> It looks like he was playing a David Cage game
[4:57:05] <%Shinny1338> !time
[4:57:06] <Joostebrood> eh sort of
[4:57:07] <%therealtacopancakes> woolie is an echo now
[4:57:08] <zocano> This is the worst one
[4:57:09] <%notgarza> He went for Blue Milk at the corner store, don't worry
[4:57:09] <naoi0> Gotta fill that pakk
[4:57:11] <$NoWayRyanTatum> DONT SAY ANYTHING
[4:57:12] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> I dont think so
[4:57:14] <+krispen_wa> Not thhaaaaaat bad
[4:57:14] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Woolie's turning into an echo within the force as we type
[4:57:14] <+wunp_fxs> bad no.
[4:57:15] <DatAsuna> Nothing on that level but a lot of little things @WoolieVersus
[4:57:16] <%psidefx> who knows....
[4:57:18] <Joostebrood> not as bad as the unmodded game had
[4:57:18] <dinnydanny777> Sadness is coming
[4:57:19] <+VCRUZZO> this the worst one
[4:57:19] <$JonnyCue> Getting those power con verters
[4:57:22] <%spiritofmojave> Not to the same extent
[4:57:22] <ingman112> He’s not GONE gone though! You know that! Why defuse the hype on purpose?!?
[4:57:22] <snakemuho> the ending used to be before restored content
[4:57:25] <%christopherwpoindexter> @ingman112 not really a spoiler? since he doesn't appear later
[4:57:25] <Sapphire_Breeze> nah
[4:57:26] <+oda_flobunaga> ridiculous but cool
[4:57:26] <zocano> Bao-dur vanishing is the worst one
[4:57:27] <dinnydanny777> A great sadness will arrive
[4:57:27] <prime_name> Oh god the Atton stuff
[4:57:28] <%Chisas_Dead_Body> No there isn’t
[4:57:29] <naoi0> Go back to Twerka
[4:57:30] <+krispen_wa> this is the worst
[4:57:30] <TDAWS_MP132> not that I can remember
[4:57:35] <+wunp_fxs> oh yeah Atton
[4:57:35] <%psidefx> psaBig OOFs coming
[4:57:39] <phatmac16> isn't there Atton stuff?
[4:57:43] <+oda_flobunaga> eeeeeh
[4:57:45] <terramagus> Atton got restored
[4:57:45] <%SilvaChariot0133> His planet needed him Kappa
[4:57:46] <dinnydanny777> Yikes
[4:57:47] <$GabeSweetMan> Bao-dur: "I have to go now, my planet needs me."
[4:57:54] <shutupandjam3465> atton stuff was msotly restoered
[4:57:58] <+oda_flobunaga> maybeeee?
[4:57:58] <%psidefx> psaBig Sad woolieGIRLS
[4:58:00] <+jiggy_snipe> @akman14 games aren't developed in the order we experience the events, they probably got to this part, removed Bao-dur but didn't have time to make the scenes where he disappears
[4:58:09] <shutupandjam3465> yes
[4:58:09] <xenolaliaSA> The real worst part is that Bioware looked at the list of characters in this game before SWOTOR and just said "Fuck them kids"
[4:58:11] <%Irridium> Bao-Dur is the most painful, easily
[4:58:11] <$NoWayRyanTatum> debatable
[4:58:14] <%bread_assassin> Bao-Dur just went out for some smokes.
[4:58:14] <AvoidingTheCoronaVirus> bao-dur stuff isn't in the restored content?
[4:58:16] <$GabeSweetMan> Bao-dur LITERALLY gets Poochied.
[4:58:16] <phatmac16> how much game do we have left chat?
[4:58:27] <snakemuho> he's not COMPLETELY out
[4:58:33] <+krispen_wa> There was NOTHING to restore
[4:58:34] <+PlagueOfGripes> "We'll complete the game for free" "No we bar you from ever completing it"
[4:58:38] <+JustToWatch> It's WORSE than poochie
[4:58:38] <+oda_flobunaga> aside from Kreia, who is just the worst Character in all of Star Wars Kappa
[4:58:39] <dinnydanny777> Bao Dur is so much better than Poochie though
[4:58:42] <naoi0> @phatmac16 Hungry boy fight and confronting kreia + crusty boy
[4:58:44] <jamesthebrave> So, the ending was absolutely the most FUCKED part of the game before restored content, and there's still some blows left in there. 14 months, man
[4:58:44] <%christopherwpoindexter> this music fits too well
[4:58:47] <+doc_ock_rokc> Beo died on the way back to his planet
[4:58:50] <naoi0> So like a couple of dungeons?
[4:59:02] <$GabeSweetMan> That the code isn't even there is nuts.
[4:59:06] <ingman112> I’m super disappointed. He’s not gone gone and V knows that but for some reason he’s puncturing the bubble
[4:59:08] <dinnydanny777> Woah
[4:59:09] <+oda_flobunaga> the Ending without restored content is Bao-Dur levels of fucked
[4:59:10] <endarren> @PlagueOfGripes How dare someone does it for free.
[4:59:12] <prime_name> YUP
[4:59:13] <dinnydanny777> That's nuts
[4:59:14] <Doodle_Taco> Wow
[4:59:14] <%psidefx> shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiid
[4:59:16] <+jiggy_snipe> that guy brings up Bao-Dur and Atton points out that HK-47 is also missing
[4:59:17] <dinnydanny777> That's awful
[4:59:17] <DatAsuna> The code is there but no audio
[4:59:18] <+PlagueOfGripes> the original ending was incomprehensible due to all the errors
[4:59:19] <olaksi> Reminder: Obsidian asked for Disney to finish the game for free
[4:59:20] <shutupandjam3465> yeah its nots
[4:59:22] <arkv01> oh LORD
[4:59:22] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> WHAT
[4:59:23] <dinnydanny777> That is actually awful
[4:59:24] <+krispen_wa> yup, endgame is FUCKED without tslrcm
[4:59:27] <startstoprepeat> @WoolieVersus people were suspicious because there's a thing where all the party members can talk at the ending and only bao dur was missing dialogue
[4:59:28] <arkv01> kotor2 had it ROUGH
[4:59:28] <+MidnightBurst12> they just disappear
[4:59:35] <astro_yojimbo> This is just like Liquid in MGSV.
[4:59:36] <$GabeSweetMan> That's rough.
[4:59:36] <Heyestus> This is an annoying place to have this conversation, because woolie doesn't know the endgame stuff yet.
[4:59:38] <+oda_flobunaga> we know
[4:59:38] <SixthSun2> NotLikeThis
[4:59:39] <$TheFabledAble> yup
[4:59:41] <dinnydanny777> Without restored content this game must suck
[4:59:42] <lotharrio> Yeah
[4:59:43] <+PlagueOfGripes> The original arguably had no ending
[4:59:44] <GenoCL> Poochie'd
[4:59:47] <%SilvaChariot0133> *snap*
[4:59:47] <$TheFabledAble> they just dispear
[4:59:49] <BurdRightsActivist> HOLY SHIT
[4:59:50] <%Reizie_Etherealm> At least Bao Dur (Remains) is better than Bao Dur (Nothing)
[4:59:51] <prime_name> At the last minute they just vanish/die
[4:59:53] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> How is the game even playable originally??????
[4:59:54] <%Binary_Fireball> poof
[4:59:54] <%Javaa01> 14 months
[4:59:55] <Zebroneath> Half the cast disappears with no explanation
[4:59:58] <prince_johnny_> damnn
[4:59:59] <%spiritofmojave> Yeah it's basically Bao dying for the greater good of the script
[5:00:00] <zocano> It's a bit worse dark side
[5:00:01] <+vaporousTippler> There's a reason people still hold a grudge against this game.
[5:00:02] <+oda_flobunaga> restored content is the only reason this game has an ending at all
[5:00:02] <%spiritofmojave> now that is
[5:00:03] <%notgarza> OH
[5:00:04] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> ON GOD?
[5:00:09] <+Purple_badger3000> I remember playing it when I was like 10 and having no idea what happened in the ending, makes a lot more sense now
[5:00:12] <%SilvaChariot0133> "Mr. Pakk, I don't feel so good"
[5:00:15] <ingman112> Like dude I get your intent but now is not the time to bring this up. The game ain’t over yet
[5:00:15] <%psidefx> woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO
[5:00:17] <+wunp_fxs> yeahhh
[5:00:20] <zocano> We know.
[5:00:20] <snakemuho> I've played through it as a kid and didn't even understand it enough that everyone's disappeared lol
[5:00:23] <%alrobot2014> oh definitely refresh the game before we get to that scene
[5:00:23] <%Sedrelic> og is barely a history
[5:00:24] <+oda_flobunaga> yeahhhhhh
[5:00:24] <+krispen_wa> oh yeah that scene
[5:00:26] <the38bandit> truuuuuuu
[5:00:27] <Doodle_Taco> I think I know the one
[5:00:28] <Sapphire_Breeze> oh yes
[5:00:28] <DatAsuna> Not a lot of closure
[5:00:30] <Joostebrood> I mean you do get closure in the sense of an epilogue. But they do straight up dissappear for the last section of the game.
[5:00:32] <%christopherwpoindexter> well...ugh, there is some explanation even in vanilla but I don't wanna spoil it
[5:00:34] <naoi0> Not yet! We're not finished yet!
[5:00:38] <DatAsuna> Yes
[5:00:49] <tiduidu> Woolie, if you're looking for an RPG to play with V later, try Alpha Protocol - short, fully voiced and written by Avellone. And jank as fuck, but it's okay.
[5:00:49] <%alrobot2014> on all playthroughs i've had the dialogue bug pop up during that scene as well @WoolieVersus , so its extra fucky
[5:00:51] <%Irridium> yeah they super appreciate it
[5:00:54] <time_axis> I doubt all of it was *meant* to be restored.
[5:00:55] <terramagus> "Hey, remember when we said you had 18 months to make the game? SURPRISE, it's 14! Have it done by next week, fuckers."
[5:01:01] <jamesthebrave> It's installed by default on the STEAM version IIRC
[5:01:02] <+krispen_wa> just listen to datasuna. they know everything
[5:01:16] <dinnydanny777> Man this game should have been finished
[5:01:18] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus 3 lead devs did a joint interviews with the modders
[5:01:22] <Heyestus> Avellone once said something alongg the lines of "I appreciate their dedication to a game we weren't allowed to finish"
[5:01:25] <endarren> @WoolieVersus The only talk that happened after Kotor II was they started SWTOR instead of Kotor III
[5:01:30] <+oda_flobunaga> @WoolieVersus this game got fucked harder than MGS5 did
[5:01:31] <olaksi> Alpha Protocol is really cool conversation game
[5:01:32] <+WutangchickeN> Is there any Avelone comments about the restored content mod?
[5:01:35] <startstoprepeat> honestly i think they just didn't have time to clean up after themselves
[5:01:36] <Retinolgaming> I think the game got an update on steam like 7 years later to give it 1080p on PC, and some stuff didn't they?
[5:01:38] <+dmtjinni> LUL
[5:01:40] <Joostebrood> @terramagus both Feargus Urquhart and Avellone have said that was mostly on Urquhart for getting a four month extension in verbal promise but not getting it in writing.
[5:01:44] <ovlarigalnea> One guy
[5:01:50] <+krispen_wa> ONE GUY REQUIEM
[5:01:51] <+gutlesscoward> snep kills dumble
[5:01:51] <olaksi> Things
[5:01:53] <%blue2red> woolieF woolieU
[5:01:55] <%spiritofmojave> all it takes is one guy
[5:01:55] <%Zayasu> stop it one guy enbPoint
[5:01:56] <+jiggy_snipe> I mean devs leave stuff in the game files all the time
[5:01:58] <phatmac16> Darth Vader is Luke's dad
[5:02:01] <prime_name> Kirby eats the universe
[5:02:11] <wowowinsane> its amazing that kotor 2 can exist as it currently is
[5:02:15] <%spiritofmojave> Kirby eats cake after the universe
[5:02:20] <shutupandjam3465> im gonna say its the restored content mod is like 30% of the game or more
[5:02:21] <fuji_92> LUL
[5:02:22] <dinnydanny777> Imagine if you got to Episode 6 of Harry Potter and instead of Snape killing Dumbledore Dumbledore just disappears
[5:02:24] <%hzflank> If any game ever needed a full remaster, it's this
[5:02:26] <Space_Pagan> "Bao-Dur - we didn't have time to finish his thread, but if I recall (it's been a while), he was supposed to die on the attack on Telos to help HK-47 get to the HK-50 factory and shut it down to save the planet." - quote from Chris Avellone
[5:02:28] <%Javaa01> echoes
[5:02:29] <+gutlesscoward> what would the jedi think about kirby
[5:02:32] <+evbites> kylo was nothing more then a diet vader
[5:02:34] <%LordSDB> woolieF woolieT woolieVS ONE GUY
[5:02:35] <naoi0> The robot factory was worst then the sewers in vampire the masquerade bloodlines
[5:02:35] <+kewlmyc> Damn V
[5:02:36] <+PlagueOfGripes> KotOR 1 is a little too hokey, especially with how dumb it portrays the dark side
[5:02:38] <+oda_flobunaga> Imagine if the last 40 minutes of Endgame were completely cut out
[5:02:39] <snakemuho> Bao-Dur (nothing)
[5:02:39] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus Also I'll throw HK-51 in the video but real talk you're gonna barely finish the game in normal stream hours
[5:02:47] <+oda_flobunaga> except for the final scenes
[5:02:54] <fuji_92> an echo of an data pad
[5:02:56] <Doodle_Taco> @WoolieVersus V do you think you guys are finishingthe game today?
[5:02:57] <%emperordread> Hollow Graham?
[5:02:58] <+krispen_wa> there's an april fools mod where he steps on a mod and dies
[5:02:58] <Joostebrood> Vash got better treatment than Bao-Dur, feels bad man.
[5:03:05] <+krispen_wa> steps on a mine
[5:03:06] <naoi0> Rip Bao-dur, following the final orders of the general
[5:03:07] <DatAsuna> Bao dur is dead but you will hear his voice
[5:03:07] <%mrblack499> whats a "one guy"
[5:03:10] <dinnydanny777> Imagine if you cut the last 30 minutes of Episode 6 of Star Wars and it just ends on Endor
[5:03:10] <%DorianCreed> @WoolieVersus Not sure if you've noticed other people saying it, but Avellone has said that Bao-Dur was meant to die in the HK Factory
[5:03:11] <%mrblack499> lol
[5:03:16] <%Shinny1338> whats the command to see stream time?
[5:03:17] <%christopherwpoindexter> someone will say something about the allies...later, I can't spoil any more than that
[5:03:30] <%Shinny1338> has it been 6 hours?
[5:03:30] <%SilvaChariot0133> psa1guy
[5:03:34] <naoi0> !uptime
[5:03:35] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 5 hours and 3 minutes
[5:03:51] <%christopherwpoindexter> ALL RED
[5:03:52] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1270228062764969985
[5:03:54] <+jiggy_snipe> the room is also kinda red
[5:04:03] <%Shinny1338> dang they calling it here or one more hour?
[5:04:04] <naoi0> Sith holocrons
[5:04:06] <StarlitStunner> There was a Devaronian companion on Korriban that got cut completely from the game
[5:04:07] <+PlagueOfGripes> like the song goes: "in the red room, with red curtains, is a dumb bitch"
[5:04:20] <+oda_flobunaga> Kreia is Heihatchi, Atris is Kazuya
[5:04:21] <Doodle_Taco> Mistborn is really good I hear
[5:04:26] <%Zohare> @Shinny1338 Taking a break
[5:04:27] <%christopherwpoindexter> @plagueofgripes what song is that?
[5:04:27] <uncledoodsauce> woolie officially has more views than pat. Kappa
[5:04:30] <%Javaa01> It wasn't even really a push, it was more of a case of "hey, there's a sith holocron down there" and she jumped head first
[5:04:32] <%SilvaChariot0133> 🤔
[5:04:39] <+krispen_wa> Ludo's Keesh
[5:04:39] <%SilvaChariot0133> Red Room Kappa
[5:04:41] <Space_Pagan> Mistborn ROCKS
[5:04:43] <+krispen_wa> Ludo's Quiche
[5:04:44] <$BallerSwagBro9k> HMMMMM
[5:04:48] <+evbites> the exile might have been drunk
[5:04:49] <lotharrio> Where the shadows run, from themselves.
[5:04:50] <%Shinny1338> @zohare woolieYE woolieYE
[5:04:50] <ralphfromdk> Little V, do you know about the theory about who might be a certain someones parent?
[5:04:57] <%jessyg920> I just started the Mistborn audio book yesterday
[5:05:01] <+PlagueOfGripes> Legends official terms are fucked up. Disney is trying to "fix" them
[5:05:09] <DatAsuna> Lotta little details sure
[5:05:20] <asylumkon> HK gets off to torture, so they arent harming eachother
[5:05:22] <+PlagueOfGripes> they were separated for a very long time
[5:05:22] <DatAsuna> Korriban had no republic contact for centuries
[5:05:25] <akman14> It's a big galaxy
[5:05:27] <+oda_flobunaga> raised by dark force users
[5:05:33] <+oda_flobunaga> correct
[5:05:38] <%christopherwpoindexter> That theory was disproven by Avellone, I think we addressed this earlier in the playthrough
[5:05:39] <+MidnightBurst12> pre hyperspace war?
[5:05:39] <%Shinny1338> @ralphfromdk Think thats the one the devs thought was really clever but confirmed incorrect
[5:05:44] <+oda_flobunaga> just listent to the radio plays
[5:05:50] <DatAsuna> Sith Happens
[5:06:04] <$TheFabledAble> Atris: "No YOU"
[5:06:31] <$Futurecity10> abys sis great
[5:06:31] <+kewlmyc> Tales of the Abyss is a good game with a rage inducing cast
[5:06:35] <Retinolgaming> V after credits you gonna tell Woolz about the important bits from Swtor? 👀
[5:06:40] <StarlitStunner> Tales of the Abyss is great
[5:06:41] <%SilvaChariot0133> But Jade tho
[5:06:41] <+Zanco23> Yeah, it was the first two volumes of Tales of the Jedi. It's set 5,000 years before the movie. Then the other volumes are set 4,000 years before the movie.
[5:06:41] <dinnydanny777> They couldn't pay the voice actor maybe, lol?
[5:06:48] <naoi0> Rocketo pawnchh
[5:06:48] <Joostebrood> @christopherwpoindexter Avellone said 'Can't comment, but good catch'. Which could just be him being coy and letting people make their own conclusions.
[5:06:50] <lotharrio> A reuse of his field breaker mechanic.
[5:06:53] <jamesthebrave> Tales of the Abyss is great, if you're willing to tolerate a main character who is intentionally unlikeable for a long while. He's got such a great character arc though.
[5:06:57] <Joostebrood> Full disclosure: I fully subscribe to that theory.
[5:07:08] <+krispen_wa> Why didn't they just have him punch it and die?
[5:07:12] <+PlagueOfGripes> fun fact: a Sith (species) was on the Jedaii council on Tython, 26,000 years BBY
[5:07:39] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Deep
[5:07:41] <thomassolorio> drinking jameson cold brew and hibiki here's to you guys remember swing first woolie
[5:07:48] <DatAsuna> @jamesthebrave sadly neither matt nor clemps could
[5:07:54] <+oda_flobunaga> sooo Age of Ultron?
[5:08:14] <%psidefx> blank first blank
[5:08:14] <+krispen_wa> Vrook you sunavabitch
[5:08:21] <%SilvaChariot0133> Luke's cool yeah once his dev actually kicks in
[5:08:23] <lotharrio> Well... you ARE the oldest one, Vrook.
[5:08:25] <terramagus> Wait, Vash can make it off the droid planet alive? She died for me and I thought that was predestined.
[5:08:27] <+evbites> vrook is old so they listen
[5:08:28] <jamesthebrave> @DatAsuna That's fine, he can be definitely be a wall if you don't find the story hooks involving him that interesting
[5:08:35] <thomassolorio> wooooooo
[5:08:40] <+jiggy_snipe> Vrook is old, did the Jedi council have a respect for elders thing?
[5:08:45] <dinnydanny777> Vrook just sucks
[5:08:51] <+oda_flobunaga> Vrook is Ed Asner sooo
[5:08:52] <KaiserMario> Dan Hibiki?
[5:08:52] <Ids560> I mean saying "Yeah I guess so" does kinda put it on them
[5:09:03] <+Zanco23> Are they streaming later today? Or do we have to wait a week?
[5:09:06] <naoi0> I could have sworn for KOTOR 2 there was some like space station where you could play pazaak and bet thousands of credits since there was only one guy there that was lonely?
[5:09:11] <%MaSterChiEfin420blntNinjA> Nice, I'm drinking some Taketsuru Pure Malt
[5:09:14] <+SolidusRex> Hibiki is best Sympogear
[5:09:15] <Doodle_Taco> Jedi council is just twitter LUL
[5:09:16] <%Shinny1338> @zanco23 just a break for now
[5:09:19] <tolloponik> that how it works in real life though
[5:09:19] <megamonmon123> it happens in real life woolie
[5:09:27] <TransDoomGuy> @naoi0 that's kotor 1 dlc
[5:09:30] <naoi0> Oh
[5:09:35] <%Shinny1338> @naoi0 Thats in 1
[5:09:38] <+dragonzord12> drinking water because i have an alcoholic drink allergy literally
[5:09:39] <%ECRead> Nikka is also a good one that's often cheaper than Hibiki
[5:09:50] <DatAsuna> It's the problem I have with detroit from the other, it teaches people that they can defuse extremists by just ignoring it. @WoolieVersus
[5:09:51] <lotharrio> "I don't want Vrook to yell at me..."
[5:09:53] <dinnydanny777> Vrook is a fundamentalist
[5:09:55] <+jiggy_snipe> yea one person can completely control a narrative or group
[5:09:56] <%bigmacjack12> From cool ship names, nothing has 40k beat. With examples such as: The Eternal Crusader, The Vengeful Spirit, The Furious Abyss, and Chronicle of Ashes
[5:09:56] <%psidefx> Nikka Whisky from the hood
[5:09:58] <megamonmon123> yep, thats real life
[5:10:04] <%christopherwpoindexter> @naoi0 I mean there's an Ithorian on Dantooine in this game that's hard to play
[5:10:07] <Doodle_Taco> The others are apathetic
[5:10:09] <+doc_ock_rokc> @WoolieVersus That is real life woolie Look up the Wrong Answer experiment. People will go to a person who is the most confident in their answer
[5:10:10] <terramagus> Stare at the wall and hope Vrook doesn't notice you
[5:10:10] <naoi0> Yeah lol
[5:10:11] <Retinolgaming> There is a weird power dynamic with respect in the jedi. Remember the story Jolee bindo told about the blind master telling the padawan directions in kotor 1?
[5:10:12] <shutupandjam3465> The council doesnt like disagreeing too much
[5:10:12] <KaiserMario> The problem with the Jedi council in this game is that they are zealots, so they don't question stuff
[5:10:13] <tolloponik> YUP! thats who group think works
[5:10:14] <+PlagueOfGripes> I suggest watching The Philosophy of Kreia video on youtube after completing the game to Woolie. Or to chat, in general
[5:10:15] <@Moobot> Please don't fill up the entire chat, @ntfth
[5:10:20] <Shade075> APATHY IS DEATH
[5:10:24] <%Binary_Fireball> coffey fuck yea
[5:10:26] <%psidefx> WHOOO
[5:10:27] <%ECRead> WOO
[5:10:34] <%SilvaChariot0133> Cheers LUL
[5:10:40] <%Shinny1338> @transdoomguy wait dlc? I had the original PC version on discs. Definitely went to that location
[5:10:42] <+Zanco23> @Moobot Damn Moobot, he probably worked hard on that.
[5:10:54] <+serpenttucker> I have no desire, patience, or energy to fucking argue with some idiot making generalizations on the internet. There would not be enough time in the day if I started that crusade.
[5:10:54] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:10:57] <%Binary_Fireball> japanese whiskey is my favorite
[5:10:57] <dinnydanny777> I wonder why HK's lines were done but Bao Dur's weren't
[5:11:00] <Joostebrood> The philosophy of Kreia content aside is an hour and a quarter too long. Also the author is a pedo so yknow
[5:11:02] <TransDoomGuy> @Shinny1338 it was dlc on xbox, pc got it from launch
[5:11:08] <Joostebrood> (well, defended loli is what I mean)
[5:11:09] <terramagus> KotOR2 did have DLC. Very basic DLC, and it was free, but you could go to a space station with a shop.
[5:11:14] <Joostebrood> (to be very nuanced)
[5:11:21] <DatAsuna> You are the MOST blue right now tho :P
[5:11:23] <+doc_ock_rokc> I second the Philosophy of Kreia thing
[5:11:27] <naoi0> @dinnydanny777 (Joke) Bao-dur had that expensive ASMR mic set-up
[5:11:34] <shutupandjam3465> that was kotor 1 @terramagus
[5:11:36] <lotharrio> I know the space shop was KotOR1... there was another one in KotOR2?
[5:11:37] <tranquilturnip> I played comedically evil in my playthrough so i'm interested in seeing how Woolies ending goes
[5:11:39] <+Exicuren> The Shop was KOTOR 1
[5:11:40] <%Irridium> @terramagus that was Kotor 1 that had that DLC
[5:11:43] <+PlagueOfGripes> trying to play gray is the most fun you can have in KotOR, despite it being really antithetical to the universe
[5:11:47] <KaiserMario> Isn't canon MC in KOTOR 2 a girl?
[5:11:47] <%SilvaChariot0133> Scotch has been carrying the past few months
[5:11:50] <+PlagueOfGripes> and anti-numbers
[5:11:53] <terramagus> KotOR2 had the Yavin 4 space station shop, didn't it?
[5:11:54] <+doc_ock_rokc> @WoolieVersus Two things can be true while both are wrong
[5:11:56] <+jiggy_snipe> happens in politics alot
[5:11:58] <dinnydanny777> From my point of view
[5:11:59] <%MaSterChiEfin420blntNinjA> @Binary_Fireball I made sure to pick up a couple bottles of the Coffey Grain when I heard they temporarily discontinued it
[5:12:05] <tranquilturnip> @KaiserMario lightside lady yeah
[5:12:07] <%Irridium> @KaiserMario yeah that's what they use in SWTOR at least
[5:12:11] <lotharrio> Cognitive distortions? You never see it coming.
[5:12:14] <+Exicuren> Yavin 4 store was KOTOR 1
[5:12:22] <prime_name> Darn Brits!
[5:12:22] <BurdRightsActivist> Sounds like p1, the GOOD Persona 4Head
[5:12:25] <+Ancopro> the twitter council
[5:12:25] <terramagus> Canon exile is female, yes.
[5:12:29] <olaksi> "Well why don't you go vote Trump then?!"
[5:12:31] <+evbites> well pat hares Britain
[5:12:31] <$BallerSwagBro9k> WAT
[5:12:35] <%SilvaChariot0133> huh?
[5:12:35] <+PlagueOfGripes> binary politics!? GASPPP
[5:12:36] <+UberWolfman> If you hate pepsi, you must love cola
[5:12:39] <AvoidingTheCoronaVirus> hate the British DansGame
[5:12:43] <lotharrio> Lousy Brits. They ruined BRITAIN!
[5:12:46] <Dangerzone979> I mean the english have it coming
[5:12:48] <naoi0> ONLY A SITH DEALS IN ABSOLUTES
[5:12:53] <Joostebrood> Canon Exile is also a terrible, terrible character past Kotor II's events
[5:12:53] <coreyyotto> that is the worst take in a while
[5:12:53] <+doc_ock_rokc> People, are stupid, A person is smart, Thus I would rather I talk to a group of persons rather then a group of people
[5:12:59] <Doodle_Taco> As Kreia said "to believe in something is willing to betray it" so criticism is only natural
[5:13:05] <AvoidingTheCoronaVirus> male exile>>>female exile
[5:13:07] <%psidefx> Guess I'm a Sith BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[5:13:08] <%SilvaChariot0133> Law or Chaos only Kappa
[5:13:08] <+evbites> the time to mock the british begins again
[5:13:13] <terramagus> Canon Exile is that blonde who stands next to you during Good Malak in the SIth Cave, but with brown hair.
[5:13:14] <+VCRUZZO> it doesn't make sense to do that in this game at all
[5:13:17] <time_axis> Im literally playing a grey playthrough right now and it works totally fine, didnt miss anything.
[5:13:19] <+Zanco23> I didn't miss it. I just don't agree with it.
[5:13:22] <+OnwardEch0> You either save the cat or throw the babies into the fire DarkMode
[5:13:31] <ralphfromdk> I play my Bioware games like this: Paragon, but sometimes even the good guy needs to smack a bitch
[5:13:40] <+PlagueOfGripes> "I'm going to be KotOR 1 dark side" Actual Sith: "What the fuck are you doing"
[5:13:47] <%bigmacjack12> From cool ship names, nothing has 40k beat. With examples such as: The Eternal Crusader, The Vengeful Spirit, The Furious Abyss, and the Chronicle of Ashes Cheer500
[5:13:53] <+evbites> pakk is a decent fellow
[5:13:59] <+metamyriad> is there such a thing as a gray sith?
[5:14:12] <+evbites> pockets was a fucked up witch
[5:14:13] <Ids560> ignoring LP funsies
[5:14:18] <+metamyriad> 'cause if so, kreia is that
[5:14:23] <naoi0> @ralphfromdk Unfortunately when I did that for ME2 it ruined my ending because I didn't have enough paragon to fix my relationship with Miranda
[5:14:27] <tiduidu> Did I waste my points by getting a highlight instead of going to subscriber chat
[5:14:37] <Doodle_Taco> @metamyriad Revan and Kreia depending of your definition
[5:14:38] <+krispen_wa> KOTOR II is fine as long as you use cheat codes to make yourself super good so you don't miss content
[5:14:39] <%Zohare> You let the queen decide Vaklu's fate rather than just saying he should live
[5:14:40] <+dragonzord12> has anyone played the game as true neutral like kill vrook and save the other 2
[5:14:56] <KaiserMario> It sounds like Woolie would really like Witcher 3 or something...
[5:15:01] <RantingRavager> I agree with Kreia because I have a fetish for one-handed gilfs
[5:15:01] <+doc_ock_rokc> @dragonzord12 Once you kill one the other two delcare you a Sith
[5:15:04] <tiduidu> Souuuunds like
[5:15:09] <+krispen_wa> @dragonzord12 It leads to the Enclave scene where the jedi masters attack you and Kreia calls you a failure
[5:15:10] <+PlagueOfGripes> the way the dark side works, canonically, is once you start accessing it, you're propelled into self service to the point that the only thing you care about is more power. every time. so binary is sort of built into the setting, sadly
[5:15:13] <ralphfromdk> naoi0 Okay, you smacked one to many bitches i guess :p I've never had an issue with stay high enough in the meter
[5:15:23] <Joostebrood> I mean the game's kind of set up so you miss content. There's an entire set of content you miss if you don't have influence points with Visas at a certain point or if you don't go dark side.
[5:15:42] <+krispen_wa> The game mechanics are kinda dumb
[5:15:47] <naoi0> I sided with Jack after her personal quest and argument with Miranda and I didn't have enough paragon to fix our relationship lmao @ralphfromdk
[5:15:49] <time_axis> its really easy to get those thresholds even while being grey though
[5:16:05] <+krispen_wa> not the way woolie plays things
[5:16:06] <dinnydanny777> Doesn't the game buff you for going full on either side
[5:16:06] <ralphfromdk> So V, do you know about the theory on who might be a certain some ones mother in the game?
[5:16:14] <308caliber> exactly it's not about light and dark, it's about choices and consequences
[5:16:15] <+VCRUZZO> Which the game does
[5:16:26] <Joostebrood> @ralphfromdk he's talked about it before but he thinks Avellone hard-denied it.
[5:16:33] <surik_at> @dragonzord12 even the restored content wouldn't help with that. 14 months is not enough time to even make a working game, not mentioning what you want
[5:16:47] <dinnydanny777> That line sounds super dogmatic
[5:16:52] <+PlagueOfGripes> you can tell why this game is one big "this setting is stupid. you can't write for this"
[5:16:53] <$GabeSweetMan> Barf-Blue answers
[5:17:09] <Retinolgaming> moon2A No one guys in chat
[5:17:14] <%SilvaChariot0133> "I dunno, Alignments man"
[5:17:18] <+metamyriad> but where is the ENLIGHTENED CENTRIST jedi who goes "the answer is clearly always between both jedi and sith, obviously we should kill and enslave HALF the galaxy"
[5:17:18] <dinnydanny777> You're basically acting like a Jedi Jehovah's witness at that point
[5:17:21] <naoi0> That was just another Anakin line of "He must face trial!"
[5:17:29] <DedlokPM> woolieYE
[5:17:31] <thomassolorio> it won't let me give you bits for some frustrating reason thanks for playing this guys I'd have never known about how good it was otherwise woolie as always cool hair music and in general overall aesthetics lil v thanks for the dope music and whiskey recommendations and remember FUCK DA CODE
[5:17:38] <dinnydanny777> "Hello sir have you heard the word of our lord and saviour the Jedi"
[5:17:41] <+krispen_wa> It's weird that Obsidian was setting up a sequel so hard when the whole game was about how stupid the setting is

[5:18:30] <+Reverend_Roscoe> THE CAPITAL
[5:18:31] <subjectg> You should see the chapter titles for halo too
[5:18:32] <naoi0> Gaddamn
[5:18:32] <+oda_flobunaga> The Vengeful Spirit
[5:18:32] <KiddKame> Woolie, after finishing this game I HIGHLY recommend watching the video "The Philosophy of Kreia: A Critical Examination of Star Wars" It is an amazing experience
[5:18:33] <TransDoomGuy> Shadow of Intent is also a Halo themed metal band.
[5:18:34] <%alrobot2014> Its their Holy City
[5:18:35] <Doodle_Taco> Damn those are Monster Hunter weapons
[5:18:39] <terramagus> If you love utility designs for spaceships, you'd probably like the Expanse. But hey, I'm not here waiting for the last book and getting really worried. Nope.
[5:18:40] <tolloponik> side B the filthiest ship around
[5:18:41] <Dangerzone979> I like how UNSC ships are designed to look like a fusion between guns and ships
[5:18:43] <%kingdovachief> High charity
[5:18:46] <dinnydanny777> Halo lore is wild
[5:18:50] <Retinolgaming> Where is the HOES MAD ship?

[5:18:55] <%christopherwpoindexter> I only played Halo CE story so far
[5:18:56] <SixthSun2> Alright, new Woolie VS FPS series
[5:18:57] <WolfemanMaverik> Woolie vs Halo when?
[5:18:59] <startstoprepeat> i'd be embarrassed to be stationed on minor transgression
[5:19:11] <@Moobot> Please don't fill up the entire chat, @doc_ock_rokc
[5:19:11] <dereks0n> We need Woolie VS Mass Effect firsf
[5:19:12] <%Lightwolfe> In Amber Clad dudes
[5:19:14] <Dementedpenguin> I got an Xbox for Christmas and weirdly Halo wasn't one of the gifts. >_>
[5:19:16] <%christopherwpoindexter> no Legendary ending yet
[5:19:17] <+griffball13> release it woolie
[5:19:18] <phatmac16> Woolie vs halo would be sick
[5:19:25] <dinnydanny777> I've never actually played Mass Effect
[5:19:27] <prime_name> Woolie vs FPS will continue
[5:19:35] <%Shinny1338> Woolie and V halo co-op?
[5:19:36] <+Kyma1020> The Almighty from Destiny 2
[5:19:39] <%Chisas_Dead_Body> !uptime
[5:19:39] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 5 hours and 19 minutes
[5:19:42] <%psidefx> I'd pay for a Woolie woolieVS Halo
[5:19:43] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Halo lore is very deep but the franchise only show like 30-40% of it in games, the rest are expanded in books or other media
[5:19:44] <+Exicuren> The Ship in ALIENS is also a Ship in the shape of a huge assault rifle
[5:19:49] <phatmac16> woolie vs mass effect is also needed
[5:19:54] <dinnydanny777> A Halo co op lp would be so good
[5:19:58] <Joostebrood> sidenote: The Infinity besides being a really dumb, incongruous name compared to previous ships sucks as a story point too.
[5:19:59] <%mrblack499> just do it
[5:20:08] <RantingRavager> WOOLIE VS CS:GO

[5:21:58] <%Javaa01> Or it was
[5:22:01] <+krispen_wa> The first three Halos were really good*
[5:22:04] <+doc_ock_rokc> Halo 1-3 is good
[5:22:04] <zocano> Halo is really good.
[5:22:07] <SixthSun2> It's a shame that 343 has Halo now
[5:22:07] <%Javaa01> Before 343 happened
[5:22:12] <%Reizie_Etherealm> While Woolie and V versus Halo would be awesome, I think Mass Effect would interest Woolie more which is great for long term LPs
[5:22:12] <%Shinny1338> No worries man. Just keep it on the back burner
[5:22:13] <+OnwardEch0> waiting for Halo 3 to drop on PC

[5:22:28] <Joostebrood> I really hate Halo's aesthetic design from 4 onwards.
[5:22:29] <%psidefx> Bungie was solid for Halo
[5:22:32] <RedSqurrl> Why not both?
[5:22:35] <ovlarigalnea> Phalaaaaaaaaanx
[5:22:42] <Dangerzone979> @doc_ock_rokc That is blatant Halo Reach erasure and I'll not stand for it

[5:22:51] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Hoes calm??
[5:22:51] <+oda_flobunaga> Da NEVa DEFETED World Killa
[5:22:54] <terramagus> Kreia is calm, but she's livid underneath.
[5:22:55] <+ntfth> Though you might get a kick out of this Woolie, there was a group of Jedi called Mandalorian Knights. They believed Jedi should be in the Mandalorian War...on the Mandalorian's side. Lead by a former Council member.
[5:22:59] <+metamyriad> hoes apathetic, hoes dead
[5:23:00] <+krispen_wa> Kreia is the slightly vengeful Hoe
[5:23:02] <%bigmacjack12> Ignore my second message, i bit cheered btw, I accidentally double sent
[5:23:02] <olaksi> Oh we are overusing this meme to death too
[5:23:02] <+TheTyper> He just doesn't know yet. :)
[5:23:04] <subjectg> If you’re interested in Halo’s ship names, they were inspired by ship names from The Culture
[5:23:05] <%psidefx> Hoes... can be CALM?
[5:23:10] <jamesthebrave> Kreia does a great job at pretending she's not a mad hoe, but she is 100% a mad hoe
[5:23:13] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> kreia is the maddest hoe underneath
[5:23:15] <+MidnightBurst12> mad enough to kill almost all life?
[5:23:16] <gypsystranger> spirit of fire is a really great ship name
[5:23:19] <ralphfromdk> Nah, Crusty Boi is so mad that he is undead, doesn't get more mad than that
[5:23:21] <shutupandjam3465> Neir?
[5:23:24] <%razielhex> razielhex subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Hey Woolie, I like how much you're digging KOTOR. Would you be interested in an e-mail detailing how things evolve in the Bioware arcs in SWTOR (which takes place 300 years after this)?
[5:23:25] <dinnydanny777> Materia in FF7 is fantastic
[5:23:28] <Joostebrood> @ntfth not to make a point of it but that sounds really dumb and prototypically expanded-universe-y
[5:23:28] <%Shinny1338> Whats the 40k plauge ship called? Seems like it was pretty metal
[5:23:29] <DatAsuna> Tales of the abyss is very that
[5:23:32] <Halospaz117> Ah, the metal gear method
[5:23:32] <Doodle_Taco> Yeah Nier
[5:23:35] <%emperordread> Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the only one I saw do it right
[5:23:40] <CastellanVon> Does this really explain the magic? Kotor kinda makes it even more mystical in ways
[5:23:44] <+eanscrale> wha baot the mitochondria
[5:23:49] <dinnydanny777> Materia being like condenswd energy turned into magic is amazing

[5:24:51] <%psidefx> But it has an explanation
[5:24:53] <cheapdoc> Don't you dare use blue mana
[5:24:56] <dinnydanny777> In FF7 materia is basically a ball of energy you use to cast magic I think, which is great
[5:24:57] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:25:05] <Robot_Nixon_> Most of dragon age lore isnt great, but how magic works is neat
[5:25:06] <RantingRavager> That's rough buddy
[5:25:07] <terramagus> I tap two islands and use counterspell. Draw 3 cards.
[5:25:08] <+Ancopro> that's rough buddy
[5:25:13] <+krispen_wa> I remember Enderal and Nehrim mods for Skyrim and Oblivion had magic be "glimpsing into other possibities", so when you use fire, you're just bringing fire from a reality where shit's on fire
[5:25:14] <DedlokPM> That's rough, buddy

[5:25:39] <time_axis> midichlorians are just microscopic jedi who live inside other jedi and make them stronger. They aren't gods or an explanation of the force or anything else

[5:25:52] <ralphfromdk> Soooo... the Matrix?
[5:25:59] <lotharrio> @dinnydanny777 It's also a dead wizard's memories. Meaning you could learn spells properly like a nerd, if you couldn't get your hands on the proper magic doodad.
[5:26:02] <cheapdoc> Would it be better if it was named the parking lot tho?
[5:26:20] <Robot_Nixon_> yes
[5:26:20] <%MrRabbles> humans came over
[5:26:20] <Visorak6> Humans were an invasive species
[5:26:21] <%alrobot2014> humans came over
[5:26:25] <+evbites> the root realm is the elves
[5:26:25] <terramagus> Humans are immigrants.
[5:26:26] <Ids560> humans did come over
[5:26:27] <%GeneralSCPatton> Humans went to another world
[5:26:29] <dinnydanny777> @zohare Yeah, I always liked the scene where Sephiroth is explaining how it's not really magic, it's science
[5:26:30] <Doodle_Taco> It was like a super big crash I think
[5:26:39] <ralphfromdk> Elves lived in this world, Humans and all the monster came from their own.
[5:26:41] <$TheFabledAble> humans came over ,and elves taught them magic, then humans genocided the elves and erased their culture
[5:26:44] <%psidefx> Humans invaded and now they hate it
[5:26:47] <tiduidu> Arcanum is pretty cool cause technology uses physics and magic bends it, so the two are incompatible
[5:26:48] <%alrobot2014> the matrix is the backend for reality
[5:26:51] <Robot_Nixon_> There is no outside the matrix
[5:26:55] <Doodle_Taco> It's like the backdoor in American Gods
[5:27:02] <lotharrio> Humans and elves I think. Dwarves and halflings (or something) came from other worlds in the Witcher. The elves just pretend that they belong.
[5:27:07] <KaiserMario> The roots of reality
[5:27:08] <RantingRavager> YOU HAVEN'T READ JOJO?
[5:27:09] <%Irridium> Steel Ball Run is so fucking good
[5:27:14] <terramagus> When's Stone Ocean though
[5:27:14] <%MaSterChiEfin420blntNinjA> SBR is the best
[5:27:16] <DatAsuna> Stone Ocean is gr8, ignore the haters
[5:27:24] <+evbites> sailor
[5:27:27] <%bigmacjack12> Ignore my bit cheer, I messed up the message
[5:27:28] <%Zohare> @dinnydanny777 Really good scene
[5:27:30] <StarlitStunner> Jojolion
[5:27:32] <%Javaa01> D4C is kinda hard to avoid
[5:27:32] <%Foopoof> !uptime
[5:27:33] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 5 hours and 27 minutes
[5:27:36] <+krispen_wa> Damn Jojo meme community spoiling shit
[5:27:38] <%jinking79> the amount of Elvis homages in Part 8
[5:27:44] <MarkUriah> bizzare
[5:27:45] <+evbites> quad clops
[5:27:50] <%Irridium> JoJo's that special series where even if you know what happens, seeing it all happen in-context is still hype as fuck
[5:28:01] <gunsrlove> uh oh
[5:28:03] <cheapdoc> that guy is on fire because of snails
[5:28:12] <+krispen_wa> CHRONICLE OF ASHES
[5:28:12] <lotharrio> Chronicle of Ashes is pretty good.
[5:28:14] <%HostilePoundcakes> LUL
[5:28:14] <gunsrlove> One guy stop please
[5:28:15] <DaikiWithDaShot> SBR is the best, and Stone Ocean gets too much hate
[5:28:17] <%razielhex> WH40K has Christofascist names
[5:28:17] <terramagus> Chronicle of Ashes is pretty sick
[5:28:17] <%bigmacjack12> Liiiiiiies
[5:28:19] <Softekan> Litany of Fury is pretty good
[5:28:21] <%CyanDeadEye> In Amber Clad
[5:28:21] <JetpackMcQuack> USNC Welcome to the Snipehunt
[5:28:24] <%GeneralSCPatton> HE ACCIDENTALLY DID A DOUBLE MESSAGE
[5:28:24] <Dangerzone979> jojo fans ruined any dsire i had to get into jojo
[5:28:27] <+OmegaWeltall> The Litany of Litany's Litany
[5:28:32] <StarlitStunner> Say my name!
[5:28:33] <$Futurecity10> Books yes
[5:28:33] <%Reizie_Etherealm> LIGHT OF THE PROFANE??
[5:28:34] <RantingRavager> THE LITANY OF LITANY'S LITANY
[5:28:34] <%psidefx> But DESTINY ship names hit tho
[5:28:34] <%Irridium> books/comics yeah
[5:28:35] <%CyanDeadEye> UNSC Heart of Midlothian
[5:28:38] <+OnwardEch0> 40K shills losing their minds
[5:28:40] <terramagus> Keep sailing
[5:28:42] <+VCRUZZO> chronicles of ashes isn't really a great name for a space vessel
[5:28:43] <startstoprepeat> warhammer ships sound like altright twitter account names
[5:28:47] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> Heresy
[5:28:48] <BurdRightsActivist> 40k idiots going MAD
[5:28:48] <DatAsuna> 40k fans always get into the dick measuring
[5:28:50] <knotsundownsyndrome> @startstoprepeat they are
[5:29:01] <%Javaa01> Yeah, ship names in 40k aren't the good part, it's what they look like and what they can do in a battle that matters
[5:29:02] <+krispen_wa> That's some Nietzsche shit
[5:29:06] <+metamyriad> Oh man Woolie should see the Hanharr cutscene and the True Lesson of Strength
[5:29:08] <subjectg> Not just that, it’s Midnight at the Heart of Midlothian, too
[5:29:11] <Dangerzone979> @startstoprepeat where do you think the accounts stole their names from
[5:29:15] <%Javaa01> Cause Sisters of Battle warships are awesome
[5:29:21] <$TheFabledAble> She desires pragmatism regardless of creed over all
[5:29:27] <Robot_Nixon_> I thought Halo pulled from warhammer for inspiration. At least my headcannon says so
[5:29:32] <gundamech> In Amber Clad anyone?
[5:29:35] <DatAsuna> At this pace we're probably not gonna beat the time tonight lol
[5:29:41] <+evbites> VULKAN LIVES
[5:29:51] <Dangerzone979> STOMP STOMP
[5:29:57] <+JustToWatch> The ship names from Ian Banks "Culture" novels might actually beat halo. maybe
[5:30:01] <%razielhex> The Jedi call upon the force to aid them; the Sith bend the force to their wills.
[5:30:01] <tiduidu> Nietzsche gang
[5:30:02] <MarkUriah> get smacked on the other cheek
[5:30:03] <mihokspawn> Stomp Stopm
[5:30:03] <+oda_flobunaga> How about the Agony and the Ecstasy
[5:30:06] <tolloponik> christ I forgot about hanhar dose that resolves at all or did that get cut as well
[5:30:06] <%Binary_Fireball> stoicism is the most human of things
[5:30:21] <subjectg> didn’t The Culture inspire those names anyhow?
[5:30:23] <dinnydanny777> Being too stoic is bad though
[5:30:33] <DatAsuna> @tolloponik Hanharr gets resolution if you take mira but if you take him in your party he disappears
[5:30:35] <%Binary_Fireball> why?
[5:30:36] <mihokspawn> 40k ship names "the Phalanx" and "Lithany of Fury"
[5:30:38] <Doodle_Taco> I think it was Jung who said that the only way to surpass humanity is accept that you are indeed, human
[5:30:48] <tolloponik> oh ok
[5:30:52] <+JustToWatch> Probably, there's a similar naming conventions
[5:30:53] <+PlagueOfGripes> well, to clarify. she hates it when you solve problems for no reason
[5:30:54] <%SilvaChariot0133> Neutral Route PogChamp
[5:31:06] <dinnydanny777> The force is a crutch
[5:31:07] <%zanzibar_junker> I still feel that the Force is malicious
[5:31:11] <DatAsuna> This is why I laughed when wolie thought she loves you because you reconnect her to the force @WoolieVersus xD
[5:31:27] <+PlagueOfGripes> do everything for the benefit of The Echo
[5:31:29] <+metamyriad> And with Hanharr she hits you with "And that's the true lesson of strength – to turn away from strength that is not your own."
[5:31:31] <theredfox930000> does little v get skinnier and skinnier every week
[5:31:36] <+ChrisAlgoo> ancap kreia
[5:31:36] <DatAsuna> Was waiting for the other shoe to drop
[5:31:39] <%Foopoof> Did they beat the game?
[5:31:40] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Every step should move you closer to your goal, if it doesn't then that step is wasteful
[5:31:44] <DedlokPM> @Foopoof no
[5:31:45] <tiduidu> He's becoming a Sith Lord
[5:31:45] <%alrobot2014> @Foopoof no
[5:31:46] <dinnydanny777> Kreia is in the back yelling "evolve or die"
[5:31:49] <$thomassolorio> Cheer500 finally I got through thank you guys for playing this and the og kotor I'd have never known about them otherwise woolie as always cool hair music and over all aesthetics thanks for helping me get in to fighting game lil v thanks you for the dope music and whiskey recommendations here's to you fine gentleman ps have you guys ever thought about playing disco elisium and remember woolie swing first
[5:31:50] <%Foopoof> Ah ok
[5:32:17] <tiduidu> Look into the Abyss and call it a bitch
[5:32:18] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:32:20] <Ids560> I believe that woolie and pat came to the conclusion that disco was LP Poison
[5:32:34] <tiduidu> Yeah. too much text
[5:32:38] <+krispen_wa> PLAGUE
[5:32:46] <$thomassolorio> hi Plage
[5:32:48] <+PlagueOfGripes> hello, fellow sentient
[5:32:52] <%Binary_Fireball> @WoolieVersus would you ever do an LP of an ElderScrolls game?
[5:32:56] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[5:32:56] <lotharrio> Plague, you better help raise Pat's butt-child.
[5:32:57] <%Lightwolfe> hi pleg
[5:32:57] <$thomassolorio> darth plagues
[5:32:57] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus I alreadyw rote you one
[5:33:04] <+krispen_wa> Fuck SWTOR
[5:33:12] <+krispen_wa> just the parts relating to KOTOR
[5:33:12] <DatAsuna> It's sitting in a spoiler tagged post for later lol
[5:33:20] <+PlagueOfGripes> I read the SWTOR books
[5:33:22] <fuji_92> guys V KNOWS, dont worry about it
[5:33:22] <+oda_flobunaga> SWOTOR is non-canon
[5:33:23] <Doodle_Taco> SWTOR big sucks
[5:33:25] <+krispen_wa> Agent is cool
[5:33:25] <+PlagueOfGripes> they were... okay
[5:33:27] <+Jaska23> @krispen_wa Agree
[5:33:34] <DatAsuna> The game is much better than the books
[5:33:34] <%razielhex> SWTOR is as canon as KOTOR @oda_flobunaga
[5:33:41] <DatAsuna> but still not kotor 2 good
[5:33:42] <terramagus> Periods are for the weak
[5:33:43] <fuji_92> LUL
[5:33:44] <ht109> lmao
[5:33:44] <+SolidusRex> We're not gonna talk about Judy
[5:33:45] <shutupandjam3465> @plagueofgripes i dont believ yo u
[5:33:50] <SomersaultJustice> is kotor over?
[5:33:50] <+kewlmyc> LUL
[5:33:50] <+oda_flobunaga> not in my headcanon it aint
[5:33:50] <+MrMoonGoose> SWOTOR is fucking great
[5:33:52] <ovlarigalnea> NotLikeThis
[5:33:53] <%HostilePoundcakes> LUL
[5:33:54] <%gamewarden92> Punctuation helps.
[5:33:57] <+metamyriad> Influence Lost: Plague of Gripes
[5:33:57] <%yeildingthought> LUL
[5:33:58] <+krispen_wa> LUL
[5:34:03] <$thomassolorio> WOOOOOOOOOOOOO PorscheWIN
[5:34:03] <+jiggy_snipe> nailed it
[5:34:05] <+oda_flobunaga> headcanon is big subjective
[5:34:08] <terramagus> Punctuation is for COWARDS
[5:34:09] <fuji_92> using periods are for the weak
[5:34:09] <%psidefx> SWANG FIRST
[5:34:15] <Kivros> SeemsGood
[5:34:16] <+oda_flobunaga> PLAY IT
[5:34:16] <shutupandjam3465> are we done for today?
[5:34:18] <arkv01> disco elysium GREAT
[5:34:21] <Robot_Nixon_> disco elysium with extra communism
[5:34:23] <olaksi> Punctuation is just dumbing down your thoughts
[5:34:28] <$GabeSweetMan> Interesting. My name is also SOMONOSUKERAMASAMA-
[5:34:29] <%razielhex> Lord Scourge is really good. Darth Jadus is super cool.
[5:34:29] <prime_name> BARS
[5:34:30] <shutupandjam3465> or are you guys gonna play later?
[5:34:31] <%LordSDB> Disco is su fucking good woolieGASM
[5:34:33] <$thomassolorio> WHOA
[5:34:43] <+Giggalith> The Culture series of books have great ship names, the AIs that control them pick their own names - "No More Mr Nice Guy" "Fate Amenable To Change" "I Blame My Mother" "I Thought He Was With You"
[5:34:44] <$thomassolorio> sweet
[5:34:46] <$TheFabledAble> its SUPER worth it
[5:34:47] <Robot_Nixon_> 👍
[5:34:52] <%Javaa01> Disco Elysium is Plainscape except instead of it being an alien hellscape, it's 90s era Estonia and it doesn't have the garbage combat of Plainscape
[5:34:55] <+PlagueOfGripes> I got an almost perfect ending
[5:35:00] <+PlagueOfGripes> supposedly.
[5:35:05] <surik_at> @WoolieVersus KOTOR 1 explored getting drunk with power of the dark side with the Twi'lek in the sith academy. But this game really pushes it to the absolute limits, forcing you into a singlt dialogue route if you decide to slaughter the jedi masters
[5:35:15] <$TheFabledAble> you get to punch a drug addict child and then sell the boots off a corpse
[5:35:18] <MarkUriah> yeah...
[5:35:25] <Visorak6> The game was scripted by a novelist
[5:35:27] <+PlagueOfGripes> you can't live read DE for an LP
[5:35:29] <%Zohare> @shutupandjam3465 Break time, outro for this has been a bit long though
[5:35:33] <+ChrisAlgoo> C H A R I S M A
[5:35:34] <+oda_flobunaga> so do 2 hour streams twice a week
[5:35:39] <%MaSterChiEfin420blntNinjA> It's not the best game for streaming
[5:35:39] <+krispen_wa> I wish I could be a hot, big titty redhead fuckup detective in Disco Elysium tho
[5:35:40] <%Reizie_Etherealm> You need 4 different people taking turns speaking each chunk LUL
[5:35:41] <%alrobot2014> you need a Fann level of force bond to get people to watch
[5:35:43] <fuji_92> he'd basically be reading a book on stream
[5:35:45] <MrWizard0022> Don't tell Woolie about Disco Elysium...
[5:35:49] <%Javaa01> Over a million words of text in the entire script of Disco Elysium
[5:35:51] <Robot_Nixon_> physical instrument build PogChamp
[5:35:52] <tiduidu> Same reason why I'll never shill a Pathologic 2 stream to Woolie
[5:35:54] <tiduidu> Sadly
[5:35:58] <+metamyriad> Just play text adventures smh
[5:36:02] <shutupandjam3465> @zohare Yay! Are they gonna try to beat this todday??
[5:36:08] <olaksi> Woolie, you gotta practice for when you start your cult
[5:36:13] <tranquilturnip> Willpower is your control over force, Chrisma is your confidence and POWA
[5:36:19] <%GeneralSCPatton> Charisma is force of personality/will
[5:36:20] <Visorak6> force of will/personalisty
[5:36:21] <sANfouR44> @WoolieVersus I REALLY suggest you guys reload the save in a factory. You screwed up the ending in a big way by not activating HK-51 assembly after reprogramming them.
[5:36:21] <+oda_flobunaga> yep
[5:36:28] <+SolidusRex> Yup
[5:36:31] <fuji_92> yeah, force of will is a good one
[5:36:33] <%Zohare> @shutupandjam3465 That'll probably be next week? Definitely not this today
[5:36:35] <+vaporousTippler> Pretty people are just better.
[5:36:38] <knotsundownsyndrome> charisma = electrifying personality
[5:36:41] <%SilvaChariot0133> yeah
[5:36:42] <+jiggy_snipe> yea V
[5:36:51] <tranquilturnip> Charisma represents your force of personality, your ability to literally force your persona on someone else
[5:36:55] <%Reizie_Etherealm> So you're telling me being a CHAD makes my force storm stronger??
[5:36:55] <+SolidusRex> Charisma = force of the whills
[5:36:59] <%Zohare> I scuffed the end of that sentence
[5:37:04] <+krispen_wa> It does not fuck up the ending, you just miss a speech
[5:37:07] <%SilvaChariot0133> psa1guy ?
[5:37:08] <Kivros> do it anyway
[5:37:09] <RantingRavager> What is force lightning if not simply a more efficient way of communicating?
[5:37:15] <fuji_92> let's see a big 3 from chat
[5:37:16] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus They're wrong, you only ruin the ending by not talking to HK at all
[5:37:18] <+jiggy_snipe> guys remember V knows stuff but doesn't realize everything to Woolie
[5:37:23] <+oda_flobunaga> sub-optimal.. reeeeeeeeeeeee Kappa
[5:37:27] <terramagus> I mean, we're like 2 hours away from the game actually being over
[5:37:30] <$TheFabledAble> @WoolieVersus Its not just "speak well" its how capable are you at enacting your will on the others AND the forces of magic around you
[5:37:30] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus tl;dr youjust got the medium ending instead of the best ending
[5:37:34] <+PlagueOfGripes> when I play KotOR 2 I just cheat at the start and max out everything so I don't have to worry about all that crap
[5:37:40] <Shade075> Ruined forever, time to start the entire game over
[5:37:41] <+metamyriad> By not activating the HK-51s, you failed to unlock Sif's extra cutscene
[5:37:48] <surik_at> @WoolieVersus higher charisma = better force bonds = better connection to the force through your bonded
[5:37:48] <+oda_flobunaga> Fann- Y'tastic
[5:37:54] <JetpackMcQuack> :)
[5:38:02] <DatAsuna> HE did miss a scene, but we got it
[5:38:03] <Divryne> JUAN GUY STRIKES AGAIN.
[5:38:21] <fuji_92> JUAN
[5:38:22] <+VCRUZZO> the ending will not be affected at all
[5:38:24] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I mean even if they get one ending, what's stopping them from looking into the others??
[5:38:29] <%OldManJEWc> in a D&D context, I feel like Cha. is how well you can speak your cantations
[5:38:35] <%Chisas_Dead_Body> Do you think Atris’ actions were purely motivated by Hoes mad(tm)
[5:38:36] <Halospaz117> I will own up to being part of one guy, my understanding of things was flawed
[5:38:36] <+krispen_wa> As long as HK-50s are shut down and HK-51s are ALSO shut down, it's fine
[5:38:37] <%christopherwpoindexter> bye y'all
[5:38:41] <+spacehouse> that pre council Kreia talk was pretty important
[5:38:41] <tranquilturnip> Individual lacking the critical information
[5:38:43] <$TheFabledAble> @WoolieVersus Its not a matter of "ruining" anything. Its a major dialogue dump by HK which is quite cool. and his his last big speach before the end of kotor 2. so I would say its important to cover since you like HK so much
[5:38:52] <+oda_flobunaga> soo, not beating it today
[5:38:52] <%gamewarden92> Echoes
[5:38:57] <+MrMoonGoose> CHA is how strong yr sense of self is
[5:38:59] <silverira> @WoolieVersus Are we finishing it tonight?
[5:39:08] <%psidefx> I need V's liver
[5:39:09] <+WutangchickeN> It turns out that missing that ONE THING in the droid factory causes the game to play the ending of the KOTOR 1 LP
[5:39:09] <Visorak6> seeya bois
[5:39:10] <+krispen_wa> It is not getting finished tonight for sure
[5:39:10] <IvesNapalm> Hey, how long are Woolie's break? First time catching him live. I usually just watch the vods
[5:39:16] <+evbites> dawwww

[5:40:02] <%psidefx> A smoke break pause if you will
[5:40:03] <zocano> honestly if it wasn't for the HK factory, they probably coulda finished today
[5:40:07] <lotharrio> Hour-ish break
[5:40:12] <%Theycallmenerf> Why they dancing like that.
[5:40:15] <$BallerSwagBro9k> BUUUUUUUT!

[5:41:05] <+metamyriad> This is the precise world without the force that kreia dreams of
[5:41:20] <$BallerSwagBro9k> DISAPPOINTED
[5:41:23] <+SolidusRex> Woolie got through the HK factory
[5:41:25] <+krispen_wa> @sphiraki just finished HK Factory. On Telos Station now

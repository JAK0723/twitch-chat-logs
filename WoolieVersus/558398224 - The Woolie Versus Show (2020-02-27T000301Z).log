[0:09:48] <+doc_ock_rokc> fuuucccckkk
[0:09:56] <%Kiam117> Kiam117 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:09:59] <%DatAsuna> when did what come out?
[0:10:00] <Pyrowire> That movie dude
[0:10:13] <%StaceMcGate> what are we talking about?
[0:10:13] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:10:25] <KitsuneManami> @WoolieVersus Read the KOTOR Books
[0:10:33] <hntronium> Space Jam?
[0:10:34] <RubberFistFight> @WoolieVersus you got the same shock mount and pop filter as me, hah. That's neat.
[0:10:35] <%darcfowler1995> ! Motivated
[0:10:38] <DocMadfox> I hated those things, I was always poor as a kid and never could get anything
[0:10:46] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Ya know, I've never seen the Space Jam movie but I've read the book adaptation many a time as a lad
[0:10:50] <+koriedacoward> Can anyone donate?
[0:10:54] <%StaceMcGate> KOTOR books are kinda trash, just fight scenes and setup for SWTOR
[0:11:09] <%krispen_wa> Revan is trash
[0:11:17] <%krispen_wa> but the old republic conics are great
[0:11:24] <%StaceMcGate> ^
[0:11:28] <+dmtjinni> Woolz
[0:11:29] <+TheFabledAble> @WoolieVersus Scholastic isnt even the worst of it. have you ever heard about american pubic school lunches? had us eating fucking burgers with milk at 11am
[0:11:30] <%krispen_wa> and i mean the novel revan
[0:11:35] <RubberFistFight> Isn't Telos where that motherfucker Carth is from?
[0:11:47] <DocMadfox> @RubberFistFight Yup
[0:11:47] <@akuda_bar> soy of the reef!
[0:11:51] <%MrMoonGoose> Oh, you mean Regan THE BOOK is trash
[0:11:52] <RubberFistFight> I'm playing through KoTOR for the first time and man do I want to tip his ass out a fucking airlock.
[0:11:53] <MasterDecoder> Soy lol
[0:11:54] <CalderGaming> mara soy kek
[0:11:55] <MasterDecoder> Sov
[0:11:58] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Revan book legit remakes me sad and angry
[0:12:02] <DocMadfox> Also Pat kept thinking this was Taris in the KotOR1 LP
[0:12:05] <%DatAsuna> Yes Carth is from Telos
[0:12:17] <+crimsonharvest> Definitely purposely skipped 100% of the exposition in that game it was absolute nonsense
[0:12:18] <%alpacasintophats> Shaxx is the BESTY
[0:12:22] <%alpacasintophats> best*
[0:12:25] <RubberFistFight> I'm playing female Revan and modded the game so I could get in Bastila's panties simply so I had a choice other than Carth. Since Juhani apparently "doesn't count" for some reason.
[0:12:28] <renegadorade> third person is sorely needed in that game
[0:12:31] <%Irridium> they added swords which are third person but yeah mostly first person
[0:12:33] <%LordSDB> Destiny has a story Kappa
[0:12:45] <renegadorade> barely
[0:12:57] <%alpacasintophats> I can see the need for a 3rd person mode for everything else
[0:12:59] <+crimsonharvest> Not only that but make the armor uninteresting to choose between
[0:13:00] <Dangerzone979> @RubberFistFight Cathar are not people according to KOTOR
[0:13:09] <KitsuneManami> @WoolieVersus Read the KOTOR Books
[0:13:09] <+doc_ock_rokc> Flying is stupid in games
[0:13:17] <+doc_ock_rokc> Its like the least intresting way to move around
[0:13:24] <%DatAsuna> There's only one KotoR book
[0:13:28] <%DatAsuna> Unless you mean comics
[0:13:29] <+doc_ock_rokc> F?
[0:13:34] <+aishman> Did the stream die-oh there it goes
[0:13:34] <KitsuneManami> Yes READ IT the one with Scourge
[0:13:37] <DocMadfox> Woolie waht did you do?
[0:13:37] <@akuda_bar> momentary F
[0:13:37] <%krispen_wa> and that book sucks
[0:13:43] <%gatorafan> baby F
[0:13:44] <CalderGaming> "one second let me F the feed"
[0:13:44] <Safarihat> mega lag?
[0:13:46] <+aishman> The KOTOR books SUCK
[0:13:46] <%krispen_wa> imagine recommending that trash novel
[0:13:48] <SixthSun2> Stream road got a bit bumpy there
[0:13:50] <StarlitStunner> Meh to bad
[0:13:50] <+TheFabledAble> lag central
[0:13:51] <+aishman> The comics are way better
[0:13:53] <@akuda_bar> lowercase f
[0:13:53] <%DatAsuna> *book
[0:13:57] <PROUD2beGINGER> oh boy
[0:13:57] <%DatAsuna> There's one book
[0:13:57] <CalderGaming> now it's trying to catch up
[0:13:59] <KitsuneManami> But it has to be DIVERSE
[0:13:59] <+TheFabledAble> there we go
[0:13:59] <+doc_ock_rokc> F
[0:14:07] <CalderGaming> there we go
[0:14:10] <KitsuneManami> F sorry LittleV
[0:14:11] <%ECRead> refresh chat
[0:14:12] <+aishman> Man, I've tapped out of Star Wars, I read all the books and shit and the "pay off" was fucking episode 9
[0:14:12] <%krispen_wa> PING CRIMSON
[0:14:17] <%ozzrabbit> Technically, in D2 you swap to 3rd person when you do emotes, supers, or pull out a sword...
[0:14:18] <Enemy_In_Disguise> I hope High Republic is good, but man do I not have faith.
[0:14:18] <%DatAsuna> Imagine being triggered by the word diverse
[0:14:35] <%krispen_wa> imagine being diverse
[0:14:37] <+doc_ock_rokc> @KitsuneManami It has to be diverse but heaven help if any diverse characters have character flaws that make people relate to them as a person
[0:14:37] <%MrMoonGoose> nb4 mad 'cause non white ppl exist
[0:14:41] <MasterDecoder> @DatAsuna Seriously
[0:14:45] <mihokspawn> I would love to see the story of how Viszla became a jedi... Because I have a viszla pup
[0:14:45] <CalderGaming> woolie you're not on game footage
[0:14:55] <CalderGaming> there we go
[0:15:02] <%DatAsuna> pup?
[0:15:02] <KitsuneManami> already lookin dope
[0:15:08] <+OhioNitsud> oh ya got some dope clothes and a sword
[0:15:11] <+dmtjinni> FrankerZ
[0:15:13] <%VCRUZZO> yup
[0:15:18] <+doc_ock_rokc> I had to refresh
[0:15:47] <Zebroneath> Here we go to the cool place
[0:15:48] <%DatAsuna> Yes
[0:15:53] <SixthSun2> Yavin IV
[0:15:55] <zocano> Here we goooo
[0:15:56] <Halospaz117> He also says "Are you an angel? Aw that was the worst line I've ever said, hope some poor kid doesn't use it"
[0:15:56] <%DatAsuna> The number is cause the whole system is named that
[0:15:57] <tolloponik> It won't
[0:15:59] <+crimsonharvest> in real life we number the planets because thats the order they are out from their star
[0:15:59] <%DatAsuna> Because lazy
[0:16:00] <Safarihat> well yavin 4 is the fourth moon of yavin
[0:16:05] <zocano> The second best part of the gaaaame
[0:16:06] <%krispen_wa> time for the best part in the game sans that part in dantooine
[0:16:06] <jaygee303> Do we have the lightsaber
[0:16:07] <+TheFabledAble> from the scifi books ive read that use the numbers for a purpose, its that the name is actually of the star the planets are orbitting, and the number is simply the numeric order of closest to furthest from the star
[0:16:08] <KitsuneManami> @WoolieVersus IT WONT
[0:16:13] <agrippaarpeggio> I love how the "old" orbital shuttle is still used, like what, 4000 thousand years later by Empire officers
[0:16:17] <%derap41> !uptime
[0:16:17] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 16 minutes and 19 seconds
[0:16:19] <+doc_ock_rokc> @WoolieVersus Its USUALLY the distance from the Star so Earth would by Sol-3
[0:16:21] <TechDragon_Z> Naming convention is typically, this many planets from the sun in this system
[0:16:22] <+Tiewolf> do a 2nd sync test it was not showing the game
[0:16:23] <Pechugaman> Get ready to meet Bae
[0:16:24] <%derap41> ok good didn't miss too muhc
[0:16:28] <+crimsonharvest> the moon of a planet is done by Number - letter like our moon is Sol III-b
[0:16:31] <mihokspawn> @DatAsuna Viszla is a Hungarian dog breed
[0:16:31] <Heyestus> Yavin 4 is called that because it's the 4th planet in the Yavin system @WoolieVersus
[0:16:32] <lotharrio> HK-Buddies!
[0:16:33] <%DatAsuna> They're numbered cause the planets aren't significant enough to each have unique names
[0:16:45] <%DatAsuna> @mihokspawn oh, sounds cute~
[0:16:46] <tolloponik> Wha?
[0:16:49] <+Tiewolf> in the books

[0:17:33] <lotharrio> Atton promises he's an ace pilot, though.
[0:17:36] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Aton is Joseph Joestar
[0:17:37] <Halospaz117> OFF THE PLATEAU

[0:18:04] <%MrMoonGoose> ONE GUY
[0:18:06] <%DensityD> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[0:18:08] <Dangerzone979> I'm 90% sure Atton is the worst pilot on the Ebon Hawk
[0:18:09] <%krispen_wa> the whole game ends if the exile accidentally lands on his neck after a crash landing
[0:18:11] <jamesthebrave> For a second there i thought Atton was full on sticking his booty out
[0:18:33] <%DensityD> IT'S THE BEST
[0:18:34] <$konekoryugamine> HYPE!

[0:19:19] <%krispen_wa> Me? I'm already HALF-HK
[0:19:20] <+crimsonharvest> im here to wreck HK's
[0:19:21] <RubberFistFight> I'm having such a great time being a comically evil character in KoTOR 1. Like holy shit, everybody "good" in that game sucks ass, ESPECIALLY the Jedi council.
[0:19:26] <$QueequegTheater> roger roger
[0:19:27] <$konekoryugamine> RIGHT?!
[0:19:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> RIGHT?

[0:19:47] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Imagine an army of HKs
[0:19:48] <evbites> i liked the droids they are so sad
[0:19:58] <%derap41> I mean with how often Droids fuck shit up Maybe Roger Roger is better
[0:19:59] <DocMadfox> Reminder: HK is a droid line, there's a ton of them
[0:20:05] <%RioGascar> the clone wars makes the droids better
[0:20:08] <+eanscrale> Well after a while they sure wouldn't want to listen to any meatbag
[0:20:11] <%RioGascar> And obviously the clones
[0:20:11] <RubberFistFight> I love walking into their council chambers with my character portrait blood-red with fire and embers coming out of the bottom of frame, and that weird-blinking Yoda knockoff dipshit just DOESN'T NOTICE.
[0:20:13] <%JJCheeker> Forget about clones
[0:20:13] <+lethallunacyx> these boys are alright
[0:20:16] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Have you been watch TCW yet? Because the droids become hilariously dark punching bags

[0:22:40] <Graxe_> So these are supposed to be an upgraded, superior version than 47
[0:22:54] <jamesthebrave> They go down fast, but they can hit you for a ton if you're not careful
[0:22:57] <+doc_ock_rokc> HK is so good
[0:23:01] <DocMadfox> @Graxe_ They're supposed to be easier to mass produce
[0:23:02] <solar_pinnacle> audio sync ?
[0:23:11] <+eanscrale> Upgraded, yes, superior no.
[0:23:14] <mihokspawn> @Graxe_ yea... superior... sure
[0:23:15] <%RioGascar> okay correction, who ever STOLE HKs design and mass produced them. THEY got murdered super hard?
[0:23:29] <%krispen_wa> depends
[0:23:38] <$QueequegTheater> Well just leave him I guess
[0:23:41] <%JJCheeker> nothing beats the original
[0:23:41] <%DatAsuna> We find out who mass produced them on a later planet
[0:23:41] <DocMadfox> @RioGascar That'd be the Emperor and.... Spoilers for SWTOR again, but VERY yes
[0:23:42] <%derap41> Sleepy boi

[0:24:30] <DocMadfox> @evbites HK is not amused
[0:24:30] <agrippaarpeggio> @bread_assassin not really. this game and some other pieces of EU media play around with notions of progress being very cyclical in this galaxy. but everyone knows that it's just a convenience to use established status quo in every SW story

[0:28:06] <SolSwagGuy56> Break me mommy Kreygasm
[0:28:08] <SheefEatsBeef> I WILL BREAK YOU
[0:28:09] <Pechugaman> Atton is best boy

[0:29:18] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Jedi thonk
[0:29:20] <%krispen_wa> Or is Flemeth just Earth Kreia
[0:29:24] <%derap41> NEUTRAL character
[0:29:26] <Dangerzone979> @lotharrio Yes
[0:29:27] <SeruraRenge> the best part is when you learn later how he protects his mind from being read. It's so simple but it works
[0:29:30] <%krispen_wa> Err thedas Kreia
[0:29:34] <$QueequegTheater> "We have several more planets to crash into"
[0:29:36] <DuoMaxwellGW> Neutralish
[0:29:37] <Chatterbox1991> Is Atton voiced by Leon Kennedy?
[0:29:40] <GarbageNirvana> I mean this did come first
[0:29:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Oh yeah she is Flemeth VA
[0:29:42] <Fantomghosthoe> kreia is the absolute shit i love this

[0:30:13] <$laphyrion> "Sleeeeeeeeeeeeeep in heavenly peaaaaaaaaace!"

[0:30:15] <%StaceMcGate> EDELGARD
[0:30:18] <Heyestus> So how's that Kotor2 dialogue compared to the first game @WoolieVersus
[0:30:24] <zocano> This is such a powerful conversation.
[0:30:24] <%DatAsuna> Atris mommy
[0:30:25] <Enemy_In_Disguise> “Care to explai-“ “Shut up”
[0:30:26] <Murphio_GS> @RubberFistFight I got that reference
[0:30:28] <%VCRUZZO> yup
[0:30:28] <%krispen_wa> Here. we . go
[0:30:32] <+PlagueOfGripes> Grandma Gray urges you to use the power of the Echo

[0:30:41] <evbites> 2 is the best
[0:30:41] <Parapattern> "My slaves"
[0:30:45] <Valentinius_Anodyne> "My slaves" LUL
[0:30:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Atris is the worst
[0:30:47] <%Chichen> 2
[0:30:47] <mexicansunglasses> MY SLAVES
[0:30:50] <$QueequegTheater> MY SLAVES
[0:30:50] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Why ever would you think that?
[0:30:50] <manwithaxe> when you first see Kenobi he pulls down his hood, kreia puts hers up
[0:30:51] <notenoughgirls> MY SLAVES
[0:30:51] <%gatorafan> Give me back my comedic slaves Keepo
[0:30:52] <%krispen_wa> wow i forgot how dumb that dialogue option sounds
[0:30:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> OH NOOOOOO
[0:30:57] <%DatAsuna> They took MY SLAVES
[0:30:59] <%Chichen> T W O
[0:31:00] <StarlitStunner> Slaves in my fanny pack
[0:31:00] <+RealThiele> she treats normals like cattle
[0:31:01] <lotharrio> That was Jo-Lee.
[0:31:05] <GarbageNirvana> If she's a Jedi she's definitely not a nice one
[0:31:05] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Fann LOVES the slavery
[0:31:08] <SolSwagGuy56> My slaves Kreygasm
[0:31:10] <+PenmanLupine> She's that Water Tribe woman that taught Katara Blood Bending.
[0:31:10] <+PlagueOfGripes> Kreia is Kreia
[0:31:12] <$QueequegTheater> She ain't no Jo'Lee
[0:31:14] <%Chichen> 2 2 2
[0:31:15] <evbites> give me back my meatsheilds
[0:31:19] <Matermind0> I NEED my slaves
[0:31:21] <+theAncopro> Slaves for comedy
[0:31:25] <%DatAsuna> THEFT
[0:31:25] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:31:31] <+TheFabledAble> I think youre right shes more on the fringes, but just not on the fringes of the jedi
[0:31:35] <+OhioNitsud> 3/5ths a jedi
[0:31:36] <+PlagueOfGripes> Kreia isn't gray, but she also isn't bendu
[0:31:48] <zocano> I distinctly remember my heartrate fucking *SPIKING* during this conversation right here
[0:31:49] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Kreia > Jolee
[0:31:57] <Junk1106> Jolie had blue/Ligt side in his Character sheet
[0:31:59] <notenoughgirls> damn we're bringing up bendu now
[0:32:04] <zocano> This conversation truly, actually, had me shook
[0:32:09] <$QueequegTheater> Always push Bendu
[0:32:14] <Parapattern> Qui-Gon Jinn Crow
[0:32:14] <%JJCheeker> That room she walked out of looked a little... dark
[0:32:14] <+eanscrale> Arron sure didn't consent to that
[0:32:15] <+RealThiele> C A N I N J A R I S
[0:32:15] <+doc_ock_rokc> Kreia is her own force. everything else is just a tool
[0:32:22] <Dangerzone979> Bendu gets it man
[0:32:24] <%RioGascar> atton has good reason to hate jedi
[0:32:24] <RubberFistFight> Jolee was a good guy who thought the Jedi were full of fucking crap (because they are)
[0:32:30] <%krispen_wa> Kreia's grey, but she's not good. Light and Dark aren't indicators of morality, nor is grey
[0:32:41] <%Irridium> She BARELY tolerates everyone else
[0:32:51] <%derap41> Acting Picard nod
[0:32:54] <%RioGascar> Fuck i would argue jedi need to go if they can do that shit as often as they do with this mind reading shit
[0:33:00] <$QueequegTheater> Man I love how observant Woolie is. Usually it results in him annoyingly predicting twists, but here it's awesome
[0:33:01] <ALTRNico> 2
[0:33:04] <+MrRabbles> Granny's favorite boy
[0:33:08] <SeruraRenge> Kreia makes sense if you see her as a Sith that hates Sith ideology and the whole mindset of "kill everyone for fun", because at the end of the day she still values power like the Sith as we've seen
[0:33:15] <+RealThiele> sith and jedi have always both sucked as organizations
[0:33:16] <DuoMaxwellGW> ? intensifies
[0:33:17] <%The_Timo> red strings and pushpins
[0:33:22] <SolSwagGuy56> Atris is a violent tsundere
[0:33:32] <+PlagueOfGripes> best not to read chat when discussing kreia, probably
[0:33:33] <+doc_ock_rokc> Free choices
[0:33:33] <%DatAsuna> @QueequegTheater not observant enough to know bao dur was in the room lol
[0:33:33] <mexicansunglasses> Option 2 Woolie Kappa
[0:33:38] <RubberFistFight> I like how Jolee correctly points out that love is a powerful force for good, it's PASSION you gotta keep an eye on. And it's worth noting that it's love that both motivated Luke to try and save Vader, and motivated Vader to toss ol' Palpy down the shaft.
[0:33:38] <%Irridium> that second one LUL
[0:33:39] <Valentinius_Anodyne> 2 :)
[0:33:40] <ALTRNico> 2 Kappa
[0:33:43] <Parapattern> I NEED my slaves, Bitch!
[0:33:46] <StarlitStunner> Tsun dere dere
[0:33:48] <%Chichen> 2
[0:33:51] <%DatAsuna> @PlagueOfGripes People have spoiled the ending in chat today at least 5 times
[0:33:58] <SeruraRenge> @PlagueOfGripes Oh they've never been playing attention to chat while playing
[0:33:58] <%krispen_wa> Passion leads to good sex tho
[0:33:59] <wydamn> "Don't worry, we're the good guys"
[0:34:03] <$QueequegTheater> @DatAsuna Do you notice when your lamp is in the room
[0:34:10] <Halospaz117> ESTABLISHED BACKSTORY
[0:34:28] <RubberFistFight> @krispen_wa Jolee doesn't even call passion bad, he just says it's important to keep a handle on it, which is true.
[0:34:29] <%DatAsuna> @QueequegTheater Yes, I notice when people take my property, like SLAVES or my lamp
[0:34:31] <%RioGascar> No
[0:34:31] <KitsuneManami> BE NICE!
[0:34:37] <jamesthebrave> I mean, the Exile doesn't have total amnesia at all, he was just kinda dazed and confused at the start of the game from being knocked the fuck out for ages
[0:34:38] <SolSwagGuy56> SCHUTTTA
[0:34:39] <%krispen_wa> KOTOR II is cool because you slowly reveal that you AREN'T a blank slate
[0:34:39] <%VCRUZZO> do it!
[0:34:44] <%RioGascar> Your character knows them from past
[0:34:48] <serpenttucker> They are recording for youtube not as a vod, so don't assume they haven't read chat just because they don't acknowledge it
[0:34:49] <$QueequegTheater> nah
[0:35:05] <%krispen_wa> KOTOR II is the opposite of the self-insert protag
[0:35:08] <KitsuneManami> romance failed :P
[0:35:08] <%DatAsuna> Game audio is too low yeah
[0:35:20] <SeruraRenge> @jamesthebrave Yeah it's not actual amnesia, it's more like he took a bump to the head and shit is fuzzy because he clearly remembers shit once reminded of it
[0:35:22] <%JJCheeker> I really don't like this lady
[0:35:30] <+RealThiele> caught ridin dirty
[0:35:31] <%DatAsuna> I like the way 2 handles the exile way more than how kotor 1 builds "post wipe" revan
[0:35:32] <lotharrio> "Refresh my memory" is catty shit.
[0:35:35] <$QueequegTheater> @JJCheeker That is a good instinct
[0:35:41] <%JJCheeker> She is a bitch
[0:35:45] <evbites> 5
[0:35:48] <zocano> Atris is great
[0:35:48] <$QueequegTheater> REVENGE
[0:35:50] <SolSwagGuy56> SHe just wants your lightsaber bro
[0:35:57] <%derap41> Refresh my memory XD
[0:36:02] <%RioGascar> A lot of characters in this I actually hate but also love
[0:36:03] <%DatAsuna> @SolSwagGuy56 She has it
[0:36:03] <jaygee303> Mic breath
[0:36:07] <Parapattern> The Jedi never go to war. NEVER EVER.
[0:36:10] <%RioGascar> like these are good characters that are just assholes
[0:36:12] <agrippaarpeggio> the best dialogue scene in the game tbh
[0:36:13] <SeruraRenge> like Bao-dur had to just call you General twice and you were like "oh yeah, I was a general". If you had amnesia you wouldn't remember that
[0:36:21] <SolSwagGuy56> @DatAsuna The OTHER one
[0:36:24] <%Irridium> I really do like how this game gives you information in the dialog choices, so even if you don't pick them you're still filled in on several things pertaining to your character/past/ect.
[0:36:25] <wydamn> @Parapattern nevuh, evuh
[0:36:31] <%Vikingdeath1> oh Sweet, i'm here for a live one
[0:36:34] <evbites> we saw war crimes
[0:36:37] <%krispen_wa> I once saw someone call this a "dialogue boss battle" and they were right
[0:36:37] <siamzero94> ofc you don't jedi scum
[0:36:58] <%RioGascar> Was this game PRIOR to attack of the clones?
[0:37:00] <SeruraRenge> literally nothing Atris says doesn't make the jedi look like pacifist cowards during the mando wars
[0:37:01] <%Irridium> number 1 sure seems interesting
[0:37:10] <sonicblade38> oi it was MANDALORIANS the threat litteraly spells its self out
[0:37:14] <$QueequegTheater> @RioGascar between AotC and RotS
[0:37:15] <%DatAsuna> @RioGascar post
[0:37:26] <%RioGascar> okay so revenge wasnt out yet
[0:37:26] <Junk1106> Don't forget Atris is also completly insane
[0:37:26] <%krispen_wa> THAT'S MY LIGHTSABER
[0:37:30] <evbites> you took my dick
[0:37:31] <+kewlmyc> PURPLE BOIS

[0:37:38] <%Irridium> BITCH
[0:37:39] <jamesthebrave> Atris has got some issues
[0:37:39] <%Vikingdeath1> Purple was the right choice
[0:37:41] <+MrRabbles> Badge turn in
[0:37:47] <+rider_megalon> she got the thirst
[0:37:49] <xXxPS9xXx> I love how the game has you build your own past narrative here
[0:37:50] <sonofthedeepsouth> Really making me think
[0:37:54] <jorniev> ah shit i missed the meeting
[0:37:55] <+eanscrale> SURE girl sure
[0:37:55] <%derap41> Right..
[0:37:57] <Parapattern> Give me it. That thing. Your lightsaber.
[0:37:58] <privatesargent> sure keep telling yourself that atris
[0:37:59] <Heyestus> #PASSIONS

[0:39:31] <jorniev> DAE WAY
[0:39:34] <Parapattern> FUCK the code
[0:39:35] <%krispen_wa> THEY LOVED IT
[0:39:36] <siamzero94> The jedi way is wrong
[0:39:36] <bendatron> doesnt this predate ROTS by a little bit
[0:39:37] <+Deosier> GGs
[0:39:37] <sonofthedeepsouth> Based aggression
[0:39:38] <RubberFistFight> FrOm MyYy peRspEcTIvE...
[0:39:39] <%gatorafan> THE MANDALORIAN WAY WAS FUCKING COOL THO
[0:39:40] <$QueequegTheater> FUCK THA CODE

[0:39:49] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Madalorian say: GG
[0:39:50] <+RealThiele> Show you da way
[0:39:54] <+eanscrale> "Good sets man." - Mandalore
[0:39:56] <%DatAsuna> The Mandalorians gave that match 5 stars
[0:39:56] <%DensityD> it's like, you only need the first 3 notes of megalovania...
[0:39:58] <RubberFistFight> "Only a sith deals in absolutes", says the jedi, dealing in an absolute.
[0:40:02] <sonofthedeepsouth> take 2
[0:40:02] <%alpacasintophats> THE GREATER GOOD comes to mind
[0:40:04] <lotharrio> "Fuck the code! Shoot THIS motherfucka, and we can all live like kings."
[0:40:08] <+MrRabbles> Mandalorians were taking notes
[0:40:12] <jorniev> actual greater good

[0:40:35] <%krispen_wa> ECHOES
[0:40:38] <%JJCheeker> What's to assess
[0:40:40] <Tucker0603> 2 is the best in my opinion
[0:40:42] <Valentinius_Anodyne> "It was for a just cause" is how you've been defending everything up to this point
[0:40:43] <%DatAsuna> Echoes and Ripples

[0:41:01] <SeruraRenge> That doesn't mean passive and let people die for a moral highground you dumb bitch
[0:41:03] <Murphio_GS> Here comes the theme of the game
[0:41:07] <+chase959> so is woolie Revan?
[0:41:07] <RubberFistFight> "WHY'D YOU DO THAT?" "Just 'cause."
[0:41:08] <Murphio_GS> Echoes of the force

[0:42:39] <SeruraRenge> oh yeah, let's just REFLECT ON IT WHILE A GENOCIDE GOES ON. Sure worked out great when we did that in Rwanda
[0:42:39] <lotharrio> Use ghost powers to throw lightning down on the books!

[0:43:12] <evbites> i wish jedi could project the shit they have seen
[0:43:17] <%DensityD> 2 is too impulsive, and 3 is very empathetic
[0:43:18] <jorniev> BECOME PAK
[0:43:18] <%VCRUZZO> completly
[0:43:21] <+MrRabbles> imagine ROLE PLAYING LUL
[0:43:22] <Heyestus> So I ask you, exile. What can change the nature of a Jedi?
[0:43:23] <%derap41> 3 is very passionate
[0:43:36] <$QueequegTheater> IT LITERALLY DID THO
[0:43:36] <+karilotl> There used to be like, a hall in memory of jedi who voluntarily left the order
[0:43:39] <+MrRabbles> this needs to be in games more
[0:43:50] <%krispen_wa> 3
[0:43:51] <siamzero94> SO JUST GIVE UP
[0:43:53] <%RioGascar> so you can absolutely just leave if you choose
[0:43:55] <%StaceMcGate> Role Playing? But how do I win?

[0:59:21] <%Irridium> not my job
[0:59:28] <Tucker0603> MMMMMM HOT
[0:59:29] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:59:31] <%krispen_wa> is chris avellone retiring?
[0:59:37] <SolSwagGuy56> Our DARK SEXUAL ENGERGY
[0:59:38] <%RioGascar> Yes
[0:59:38] <jamesthebrave> "Caged for their safety"
[0:59:45] <$QueequegTheater> O.o
[0:59:45] <%krispen_wa> motherfucker
[0:59:50] <agrippaarpeggio> @Quarkee tbh, pillars doesn't have the best writing. it's hard to compare it to this
[0:59:55] <mexicansunglasses> @krispen_wa He's writting Dying Light 2
[0:59:57] <%RioGascar> but hes teaching a new generation of writers ar...new york i think?
[1:00:04] <$QueequegTheater> Atton is so fucking interesting
[1:00:06] <siamzero94> Oh no what have they done to him? Snu Snu?
[1:00:14] <%RioGascar> Oh and hes on contract work for dying light 2
[1:00:16] <evbites> mando?
[1:00:22] <%JJCheeker> bang her
[1:00:27] <Rixstarian> @agrippaarpeggio Nihlus isn't exactly well written
[1:00:36] <MasterDecoder> @JJCheeker like a drum
[1:00:43] <trickquestionz> Nihlus is great shut up
[1:00:47] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Atton is super cool the more ya learn about him
[1:00:49] <%RioGascar> chris avellone and marc laidlaw are probably the 2 best writers in video games...and both are retired
[1:00:49] <%TRILLTURBAN> I hope they don't forget the battle circle
[1:01:03] <agrippaarpeggio> @Rixstarian Nihlus doesn't really talk, so there's that
[1:01:17] <zocano> Nihlus works well as the foil to the Exile
[1:01:19] <$QueequegTheater> So Fann is now HARD blue, right
[1:01:19] <Rixstarian> @trickquestionz He -could- have been great. But he isn't
[1:01:19] <%krispen_wa> Isn't Nihlus the dead Spectre agent you meet in ME1?
[1:01:21] <%DatAsuna> noooope
[1:01:24] <siamzero94> They are not trained
[1:01:30] <%JJCheeker> I like his mask
[1:01:41] <SeruraRenge> I don't remmeber if Nihilus is even able to talk
[1:01:51] <%krispen_wa> He talks in gutteral sex sounds
[1:01:53] <zocano> He does @SeruraRenge
[1:01:57] <%JJCheeker> he kind of does
[1:02:00] <Tucker0603> she's got your bodypillow of you and her vibrators in there @WoolieVersus
[1:02:10] <%JJCheeker> Just not in basic
[1:02:15] <SeruraRenge> @zocano Yeah but we can't understand it, it's all just wierd sounds
[1:02:16] <DestroyerPhoenix> LUL

[1:02:19] <%Firststrike_OW> this voice LUL
[1:02:22] <KaseKaizer> stripCult
[1:02:29] <SolSwagGuy56> Embrace DEEZ NUTS
[1:02:30] <lotharrio> Embrace the universal truth.
[1:02:31] <%krispen_wa> Yeah, I don't get how people fall for the obvious Dark Side evil shit
[1:02:32] <%The_Timo> NO NO that's too much
[1:02:36] <+Deosier> universal truths
[1:02:37] <Badgerconda_> EMBRACE THESE POCKETS
[1:02:40] <%RioGascar> you can see how every option was considered. like every option
[1:02:43] <%krispen_wa> it's the worst part of the Star Wars setting in terms of believablity
[1:02:44] <%derap41> And then they're burning villages
[1:02:48] <Sweatpants_Samurai> It’s a room full of Bless records
[1:02:52] <trickquestionz> Woolie sounds like he's talking from experience.
[1:02:53] <CalderGaming> "debate me"
[1:02:54] <jorniev> embrace the dark side of these nuts!
[1:02:59] <%gatorafan> The Kool-Aid is optional - Darth Revan
[1:03:02] <%DensityD> THE GREATER GOOD(s and services)
[1:03:03] <+doc_ock_rokc> Oh no, Should I stay and watch woolie dive into this nonsene or watch pat suffer
[1:03:08] <ThatGuyThere03> it's almost like being an isolated monk made them incredibly sheltered
[1:03:09] <siamzero94> How the sith manage to manipulate anyone is beyond me
[1:03:12] <CrypticMochi> Dark juice is a drug
[1:03:13] <CalderGaming> "you criticize capitalism yet you participate in it"
[1:03:20] <%awkwardl0ser> I’m starting to think maybe Palpatine was shite the entire time
[1:03:23] <agrippaarpeggio> Like what would you want for Nihilus to be well written? Redemtion ark? Another sob story how he was a goody-two-shoes jedi, fell to the dark side and became eeeevul?
[1:03:30] <%alrobot2014> @doc_ock_rokc do both with a multitwitch or a tab stack if your browser supports it
[1:03:30] <SeruraRenge> @CalderGaming I am smart!
[1:03:32] <Pappajimbo> listen evil really great
[1:03:33] <%DatAsuna> Oh this is the voice of the smuggler in SWTOR
[1:03:34] <Rixstarian> Fuck no
[1:03:38] <zocano> Nihlus works exactly fine for what he needs to be in the story
[1:03:42] <%StaceMcGate> so which one of you sisters is dtf?
[1:03:47] <zocano> I don't see anything wrong with Nihlus
[1:03:49] <CalderGaming> @SeruraRenge that's the one
[1:03:49] <jorniev> whites
[1:04:03] <SolSwagGuy56> What is she doing with our lightsaber
[1:04:04] <Rixstarian> @agrippaarpeggio Actual meaning & significance. No pay off from him
[1:04:07] <%DatAsuna> @zocano my issue with nihius is less him himself and more the people who talk about him
[1:04:09] <%TRILLTURBAN> "blessed be the fruit" headass
[1:04:14] <DocMadfox> All Jedi are a creepy cult. Also Atriss wants that exiled D
[1:04:17] <SeruraRenge> @zocano He's a plot point and a piece of thematic writing. In terms of being a character, he literally isn't one
[1:04:19] <SheefEatsBeef> it's ok because they're hot
[1:04:20] <+doc_ock_rokc> hmmm
[1:04:22] <%RioGascar> tbf this temple is like this to hide her presence
[1:04:23] <%Irridium> hmmm
[1:04:24] <Tucker0603> hmmmmmm
[1:04:26] <tranquilturnips> Atris has told hmm
[1:04:27] <%RioGascar> so boring but safe
[1:04:28] <%krispen_wa> Nihilus is an eldritch being, he doesn't need a character
[1:04:30] <ALTRNico> serve huh Kappa
[1:04:32] <RubberFistFight> "Don't ask questions, just S E R V E"
[1:04:37] <zocano> I don't see that as a downside @SeruraRenge
[1:04:39] <+crimsonharvest> Getting major NWN Aribeth Tylmarande vibes
[1:04:43] <zocano> He exists as the foil to the Exile
[1:04:45] <zocano> in every way
[1:04:45] <Djinnazz> oh so it' THEIR fault huh
[1:04:49] <DocMadfox> Atriss is full of herself
[1:04:50] <MidnightBurst12> Atris knows of the greater good as well
[1:04:54] <SeruraRenge> @zocano I mean in contrast to Sion who has a lot of character
[1:04:56] <Rixstarian> @krispen_wa Other Eldritch were better written
[1:04:57] <SolSwagGuy56> NO U FELL >:(
[1:04:57] <nexusj13> "it's everyone elses fault, not mine!"
[1:04:59] <RubberFistFight> @krispen_wa isn't he literally just a knot of force energy animating a suit of armor?
[1:04:59] <%StaceMcGate> white is right
[1:04:59] <+karilotl> nihilus is a force of nature and foil to the exile
[1:05:03] <ThatGuyThere03> Is she saying you're as bad as a fucking Sith Lord?
[1:05:09] <%derap41> All clear clean
[1:05:14] <%DatAsuna> Atris says WHITE PSPS ONLY
[1:05:15] <%alrobot2014> the last jedi has decided that white is right
[1:05:17] <zocano> Sure but that's how the triumvirate is written
[1:05:17] <+MrRabbles> oh no
[1:05:19] <jorniev> what are you an smt villain?
[1:05:19] <%Irridium> WHITE IS COMING
[1:05:30] <%StaceMcGate> THE RACIST wins again
[1:05:30] <trickquestionz> He's a Lovecraftian Elder God made out of the dark side, that's awesome
[1:05:36] <CrypticMochi> Become ultra celibates and fall harder into the dark drug anarchy!
[1:05:36] <%derap41> But for real these Crazy girl are supa hot
[1:05:48] <jorniev> not the whites!
[1:05:52] <Fujiwara_92> Not really
[1:05:54] <SeruraRenge> @trickquestionz I mean kinda? He became that way by accident and is just now stuck in that role
[1:05:55] <%krispen_wa> @Rixstarian an eldritch being that's written as a character is a failed eldritch being though? You don't want fucking Amygdala to have dialogue lines
[1:06:04] <%StaceMcGate> Atris made the trains run on time
[1:06:04] <Tucker0603> hhmmmm
[1:06:08] <%derap41> White and light purple loos really good together
[1:06:11] <CalderGaming> Let Me Be The Blesser Of All Souls
[1:06:12] <tranquilturnips> 🤔
[1:06:19] <Badgerconda_> They're just Atris's Woolie-bait.
[1:06:19] <SeruraRenge> @StaceMcGate I'm have a feeling she didn't
[1:06:23] <%krispen_wa> NO U

[1:07:07] <Rixstarian> @krispen_wa I'm not asking for him to have dialogue. I'm asking for there to be a point to him being there that no one else can fill
[1:07:07] <jamesthebrave> Atris stubs her toe in the morning and blames it on the Exile
[1:07:08] <evbites> you know who sucks my hot ex

[1:11:51] <%jiggy_snipe> how embarrassing and girls were watching
[1:11:51] <notenoughgirls> PUNCH GLOVES
[1:11:52] <SeruraRenge> @jamesthebrave They are RNG. The final Ring of Honor match I won with like 80% of my health left after getting stomped 4 times in a row
[1:11:52] <%RioGascar> Good jov
[1:11:52] <%StaceMcGate> use dem adrenals
[1:11:56] <jamesthebrave> @agrippaarpeggio True, but I REALLY felt it there
[1:11:58] <%alrobot2014> do you not get to wear the punch gloves
[1:12:01] <+zaibatsu_member_333> FLURRY
[1:12:05] <lotharrio> Woolie, nothing but girls are watching.
[1:12:09] <%krispen_wa> You can wear punch gloves
[1:12:13] <raichu1972> pretty sure you can wear the punch gloves
[1:12:16] <%krispen_wa> but even having punch gloves is RNG
[1:12:17] <%Irridium> Literally every girl is watching this
[1:12:18] <%krispen_wa> which is dumb
[1:12:23] <+chiluzza> Woolie PUNCH GIRLS are watching

[1:12:29] <%alpacasintophats> you do have punch gloves you know

[1:12:44] <Badgerconda_> do you have any better headgear for this?
[1:12:45] <+doc_ock_rokc> punch girls in tiny hats are watching
[1:12:51] <%krispen_wa> they do have everything but chest armor actually
[1:12:52] <SnaKemuho> ALL THE OVERHEADS
[1:12:56] <agrippaarpeggio> you can push them out of the borders and win
[1:12:58] <%krispen_wa> so you can use gloves
[1:12:59] <%gatorafan> Use the Sonic Shoes
[1:13:06] <manwithaxe> when you take damage every turn a drop in evasion is kinda unimportant
[1:13:09] <+caffienatedjedi> I want to see the cheaty method for fun.

[1:51:17] <Valentinius_Anodyne> "Yeah, a harem"
[1:51:19] <%RioGascar> ...is jedi scientology? How does the jedi finding funding in times of peace? WHAT IS THE SALARY OF A JEDI???

[1:53:39] <ThatGuyThere03> Wait
[1:53:40] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Indeed
[1:53:41] <%derap41> Anyone can learn shielding not everyone can real sensitivity
[1:53:45] <Narukamiiii> That's always been a thing

[1:55:10] <Halospaz117> Your just stating her intentions
[1:55:11] <%derap41> 1 isn't Praising her
[1:55:11] <%krispen_wa> SPITTING TRUTH
[1:55:23] <%RioGascar> just stating intentions not goals

[1:56:26] <$Rezca> The PTSD is strong with him
[1:56:36] <%VCRUZZO> truly he is
[1:56:38] <%RioGascar> Thats a weird one
[1:56:42] <DocMadfox> "What happened to Atton?" "He's sleeping." "Face down against an energy field?" "He was very tired."
[1:56:43] <lotharrio> Bao-Dur is a sensitive guy.
[1:56:43] <%krispen_wa> Bao-Dur is so hard to max influence with
[1:56:44] <SnaKemuho> deprecious boy
[1:56:47] <tranquilturnips> He closes up quick
[1:56:47] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus But you CAN corrupt him on a DS playthrough by faking it in front of him
[1:56:52] <%krispen_wa> you need to use a guide and shit
[1:56:53] <gruulmagebeast> what race exactly is bao dur
[1:56:54] <%RioGascar> When he goes into dead state his arm is still powered
[1:56:56] <Heyestus> Bao-Dur had a lot of content scrapped during production

[1:57:19] <T_Sasquatch> Fuck
[1:57:20] <DestroyerPhoenix> he calls himself iridonian gruulmagebeast
[1:57:28] <%VCRUZZO> what a genius
[1:57:30] <indig0bird> You can get a ton of Influence at Dantooine if you enter the Crystals Cave with a cave and have him while you do the objective
[1:57:32] <MidnightBurst12> iridonia was his homeworld
[1:57:34] <jorniev> mask twinsies
[1:57:37] <indig0bird> For Bao-Dur
[1:57:39] <+caffienatedjedi> So the so called Jedi is stealing public utilities and may or may not be commiting tax fraud.
[1:57:44] <%derap41> He needs a hug
[1:57:46] <Halospaz117> BRING ATTON
[1:57:49] <Halospaz117> GOOD DIALOGUE
[1:57:52] <%DatAsuna> Calling yourself Iridonian generally indicates you're more of a traditionalist
[1:57:56] <$QueequegTheater> BRING ATTON
[1:58:13] <$QueequegTheater> T3 IS A GOOD BOY
[1:58:14] <Camail> the transition always messed with me LUL

[1:58:21] <siamzero94> The whafft of Light side begone
[1:58:22] <%DensityD> drop your shield
[1:58:24] <%DatAsuna> It's kinda like calling yourself Persian even though you're Iranian
[1:58:27] <%RioGascar> When i wanna bring EVERYONE
[1:58:29] <+katarjin> noooo
[1:58:31] <%RioGascar> I WANT EVERYONE IN

[1:58:45] <%BioHunter> woolie I swear

[1:58:48] <Camail> BACKSEATING VALIDATES ME
[1:58:49] <%DatAsuna> Like Carth
[1:58:50] <%RioGascar> or at least have party members have discussions all the time
[1:58:53] <Camail> ya fucks
[1:59:00] <indig0bird> Man, there's one point in the game where OH FUCKING BULLSHIT
[1:59:02] <lotharrio> She's got your back so much, she's blackmailing, threatening and assaulting your friends for you!
[1:59:03] <+MrRabbles> but you're Granny's favorite
[1:59:04] <tolloponik> but You'r Character Dousn't know THAT!
[1:59:06] <trickquestionz> Yeah we heard
[1:59:06] <zenith0111> WOOLIE DON'T TRUST LIKE THAT
[1:59:14] <Tucker0603> YEYEYYEYEYE
[1:59:15] <indig0bird> There's some mechanics fuckery with kreia later on
[1:59:16] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> There's a way to make Kreia's portrait light side by controlling her and making her do certain light side actions but she eventually reverts back to grey.
[1:59:18] <%DensityD> this sounds like that one thing Captain Jack Sparrow said, savvy?
[1:59:30] <siamzero94> VERY CLOSELY
[1:59:33] <KitsuneManami> YES
[1:59:37] <KitsuneManami> Very Much so Restored

[1:59:38] <$QueequegTheater> It is, I didn't get this first go around
[1:59:40] <%RioGascar> Wool your breaking character and doing out of character knowledge. THIS WILL IMPACT YOUR ROLEPLAY GRADE
[1:59:41] <Heyestus> this is an OG conversation

[1:59:44] <tranquilturnips> stick
[1:59:48] <%DensityD> do you think if you kissed her, her skin would be cold?
[1:59:50] <%krispen_wa> FUCK HIM, MY APPRENTICE
[1:59:52] <+MrRabbles> its a shame this doesn't happen on a female playthrough normally
[1:59:54] <lotharrio> "Ask him if he's thinking about me. If he's dating anyone."
[1:59:56] <KaseKaizer> did you not see him kick all our asses
[1:59:58] <%derap41> They cut this because it made her motives to obvious
[2:00:03] <%zeroarturia> zeroarturia subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months, currently on a 15 month streak! YOO WOOLIEEE!!! Playing KOF Allstar while watching you, also got Vanessa and Ramon in one go.
[2:00:03] <elspiceweasel> GET THAT JEDICK

[2:00:27] <evbites> give me the measurements of his "dark side"
[2:00:27] <Blazeofflame> t tho!!!
[2:00:27] <KitsuneManami> @gruulmagebeast mods ftw
[2:00:30] <%krispen_wa> dats why you use mods to get her instead of disciple as a female
[2:00:32] <%RioGascar> hey lady JOHN WILLIAMS IS ON OUR SIDE
[2:00:37] <%DensityD> THE GREATER GOOD(s and services)™
[2:00:40] <$QueequegTheater> @gruulmagebeast They do in hacked save files
[2:00:40] <%DatAsuna> Now I wanna see a shitty "did i hurt when you fell to the darkside?" pickup line on a sith
[2:00:41] <%gatorafan> Even John disagrees with you, lady
[2:00:46] <GarbageNirvana> I mean things are lookin kinda dark over here too
[2:00:52] <%alpacasintophats> hey are memory locks a thing in this setting?

[2:00:56] <resloxxx> Wools will remember this
[2:00:57] <jorniev> did woolie say TWERKA instead of czerka?
[2:00:58] <tranquilturnips> Suspicion go up
[2:01:00] <%alpacasintophats> I've never played this game before
[2:01:01] <SnaKemuho> Woolie influence lost
[2:01:06] <zenith0111> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[2:01:08] <$QueequegTheater> I'm really happy Woolie isn't falling for her bullshit, a lot of players do
[2:01:09] <MasterDecoder> I'm somewhat sure that wasn't restored, I remember it on Xbox @WoolieVersus
[2:01:15] <Halospaz117> Dude, I don't think SHE wants you to trust her
[2:01:16] <gruulmagebeast> @QueequegTheater are they using a mod to allow for both or no?
[2:01:17] <ALTRNico> ayy Kappa
[2:01:18] <%StaceMcGate> Woolie wants the Kreia juices
[2:01:18] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @siamzero94
[2:01:19] <%DatAsuna> >having high kreia influence xD

[2:01:23] <notenoughgirls> dont know how i feel about that restored scene
[2:01:26] <Joestar1890> V Woolie Suspicious
[2:01:29] <$QueequegTheater> @gruulmagebeast no, but I do
[2:01:31] <Lamokmok> Yeah Disciple sucks. I kind of forgot about him in my playthrough.
[2:01:32] <%gatorafan> @jorniev, Czerka and Twerka are different things (the later is Woolie's small business)
[2:01:32] <%RioGascar> woolie your breaking character with this knowledge YOU KNOW but your character DOES NOT. A DM WOULD HAVE YOUR ASS
[2:01:36] <elspiceweasel> Kreia juice. A warrior's drink!
[2:01:43] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Oh I am, I love her buffs
[2:01:43] <siamzero94> Woolie calm down, not everything is as it seems
[2:01:54] <lotharrio> What a coincidence... she has an amazing feature that makes you want to use her, even when she's acting sketch AF
[2:01:58] <mrjohncarlton> V should know better than trying to tempt Woolie with "optimal Play"
[2:02:04] <%DatAsuna> Also yes as Rio says, this is Non-diegteic information you have
[2:02:08] <$QueequegTheater> WE HAVE QUESTIONS
[2:02:08] <%krispen_wa> Kreia would love how Woolie doesn't trust her

[2:16:56] <siamzero94> ??? Pockets was a woman, i think
[2:17:04] <+Nobrev> have you all forgotten pockets
[2:17:04] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1232714491890208768
[2:17:07] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Remember Pockets, Chat?
[2:17:09] <+MrRabbles> they used she to refer to Fann in one line
[2:17:10] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Kappa
[2:17:14] <lotharrio> Atris is angry because Fann went for heresy with Revan and not with her. Pockets was too tempting.
[2:17:14] <DocMadfox> BBDS
[2:17:26] <$QueequegTheater> @MrRabbles No, they were referring to Revan and her teacher
[2:17:27] <gruulmagebeast> woolie wanting show atris his dark side if you know what I mean
[2:17:28] <tranquilturnips> you wanna like, chill Atris?
[2:17:31] <jorniev> you nnever had black lighting before !
[2:17:31] <Tucker0603> she would have locked him in her sex dungeon
[2:17:36] <SnaKemuho> how are they not shitting on Atris for being so emotional
[2:17:41] <%gatorafan> The Sith Gift
[2:17:44] <+lethallunacyx> oh no I'm not a "jedi" anymore boo fuckin hoo, I'm gonna go the whole universe is at my disposal
[2:17:46] <%Irridium> "bitch you ain't gettin' that dick calm yourself"
[2:17:50] <SeruraRenge> How is EVERY Jedi more reasonable than Atris
[2:17:51] <DuoMaxwellGW> What a good guy
[2:17:54] <lotharrio> "Poor little white robe."
[2:17:55] <+Nathillon> Atris is a turbo proprietor of the self fulfilling prophecy.
[2:17:59] <siamzero94> Atris: "I just wanted to be dicked down once in my life"
[2:18:01] <+punch_ghost> Sith Width
[2:18:02] <jamesthebrave> "Damn him and his delicously sculpted abs!"
[2:18:04] <MidnightBurst12> the biggest of thirst
[2:18:07] <bendatron> BOOOOOO
[2:18:25] <%ozzrabbit> Interesting that they call Darth Reven “she”
[2:18:25] <lotharrio> "Alright so let's start brainwashing people."
[2:18:27] <bendatron> vrook sucks
[2:18:34] <zenith0111> DendiFace
[2:18:37] <gruulmagebeast> why is the jedi council always garbage
[2:18:39] <DocMadfox> @ozzrabbit You pick Revan's gender at the beginning
[2:18:42] <%StaceMcGate> you choose Revan's gender at the start
[2:18:43] <Deadbulky> Jedi hypocties gonna hypocrite
[2:18:48] <DestroyerPhoenix> ozzrabbit well yeah, cuz pockets
[2:18:48] <siamzero94> @ozzrabbit You did watch the Kotor 1 LP, right?
[2:18:56] <lotharrio> @ozzrabbit You set it up via a conversation at the start. Also if KOTOR had a lgihtside or darkside ending.
[2:18:59] <%TRILLTURBAN> Revan is referred to as "she" because Woolie picked dialogue that bases his playthrough off of his LP of KOTOR 1
[2:19:17] <%DatAsuna> I hope they pick Onderon first
[2:19:20] <lotharrio> 60 Million Double Dollar Jedi Vash.
[2:19:22] <manwithaxe> all never smoke weed with Ez Kai El again
[2:19:25] <aimlesshealer> Maybe you made a little hole with the lightsaber blade and like shoved the hilt into it?
[2:19:26] <+MrRabbles> only masters huh
[2:19:27] <+Shockrates20XX> Kreia is awfully menacing with that axe.
[2:19:29] <DuoMaxwellGW> remember when Korriban was a thing?
[2:19:33] <%Irridium> she would sure like to grease those cheeks I tell you what
[2:19:34] <$QueequegTheater> Don't go to Korriban first
[2:19:34] <%DatAsuna> Korriban is best done last
[2:19:35] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Yes yes Woolie, we all know you'd join the Sith just to flip one to the council
[2:19:39] <+TysonPG> As someone who rpd as yoda in an rp server, shit talking someone when they walked outside the room was common.
[2:19:49] <%RioGascar> I mean hiding on a SUPER EVIL planet as a jedi WOULD BE REALLY HARD to find
[2:19:50] <%StaceMcGate> @QueequegTheater V knows whats up
[2:19:52] <siamzero94> STEALTH 100
[2:20:00] <gruulmagebeast> Haindmaiden: "Whatcha guys talking about"
[2:20:10] <$Rezca> Jedi- master shit talkers
[2:20:19] <Deadbulky> Maybe
[2:20:25] <+KENTASHIRO> You are in for such a treat woolz
[2:20:26] <%DatAsuna> You can't argue with a star map

[2:20:37] <Deadbulky> Kreia gonna drop bars
[2:20:37] <%alrobot2014> you can't talk massive shit to the star map

[2:23:03] <%TRILLTURBAN> Fann is just admiring dat ass
[2:23:07] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> that's a glitch
[2:23:11] <+zaibatsu_member_333> Embrace the woolie bait, LOVE the bait
[2:23:15] <%RioGascar> so am i the only who wants this game to allow EVERY party member to travel with you? Just for conversations and talking
[2:23:16] <$QueequegTheater> Fann looks stoned as fuck
[2:23:16] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> Fann y's not moving at all
[2:23:19] <%DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus To be fair, you know things the exile doesn't because camera
[2:23:27] <elspiceweasel> "Kreia" is spanish for "I lie about droids and jedi"
[2:23:35] <%Irridium> is fann not moving
[2:23:36] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> Kreida
[2:23:41] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Interesting that Woolie takes lies so personally
[2:23:45] <$QueequegTheater> Kreitos
[2:24:04] <%RioGascar> @woolieversus you are using out of character knowledge about the exile and the game that was revealed OUT of your POV.
[2:24:12] <$QueequegTheater> @RioGascar So what

[2:25:14] <+BionoidLCR> @Tucker0603 that sounds real dangerous
[2:25:14] <%Irridium> yeah you know what she can have it it's hers now
[2:25:14] <evbites> my old one is so gross now
[2:25:15] <ScreamLord> @WoolieVersus There's an alternative to Lightsabers called a Broadsaber. Basically it's a Lightsaber with its blade flattened into an actual blade which gives it better cutting add piercing power and it's better at deflecting blaster bolts
[2:25:15] <siamzero94> I don wanna know where that saber has been
[2:25:19] <DuoMaxwellGW> parts unknown
[2:25:20] <+alpharius88> that ligthsaber its barren...
[2:25:21] <tranquilturnips> 👀 💧
[2:25:21] <lotharrio> Well it hums like a lightsaber...
[2:25:23] <Admiral_PopnFresh> DONT PRESS THAT BUTTON
[2:25:26] <%TRILLTURBAN> Remote-controlled
[2:25:27] <ScreamLord> @WoolieVersus Unfortunately it's not very good at omnidirectional cutting like basic bitch Lightsabers are. So because it requires basic swordplay knowledge about Edge Alignment Jedi shit all over this over all superiorly designed weapon.
[2:25:27] <manwithaxe> vibrating lightsaber
[2:25:28] <jorniev> keep that one
[2:25:28] <+doc_ock_rokc> atrius has a modification that makes it vibrates the saber
[2:25:29] <Joestar1890> She's got a Fann Shrine
[2:25:29] <%DatAsuna> DOUBLE BLADED LENGTH
[2:25:31] <T_Sasquatch> ribbed is overrated
[2:25:31] <gruulmagebeast> why is the hilt purple and rubbery now

[2:25:45] <ralphfromdk> You don't wanna know where it has been :D

[2:33:48] <elspiceweasel> its deep speech
[2:33:51] <aimlesshealer> the black speech
[2:33:51] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Deep one
[2:34:04] <$QueequegTheater> @RubberFistFight Yo you got a list I can use
[2:34:06] <%alpacasintophats> the most infernal of abyssal cthulian
[2:34:14] <lotharrio> The sound of the Dark Side staring back into you.
[2:34:16] <gruulmagebeast> he speaks in XBOX LIVE
[2:34:18] <+fandomgod> I think it was Sith Language
[2:34:24] <%alpacasintophats> it's the sound of chaos
[2:34:26] <%startstoprepeat> i'm not sure if he's even speaking
[2:34:28] <%DatAsuna> It's literally no language
[2:34:29] <KaseKaizer> haHAA
[2:34:37] <%DatAsuna> in universe it's not anything
[2:34:41] <+fandomgod> No I'm pretty sure it is Sith Language
[2:34:48] <%jinking79> luck bitch
[2:34:50] <%RioGascar> it does sound like someone speaking
[2:34:51] <GarbageNirvana> A protocol droid would try and start leaking a black viscous fluid
[2:34:55] <RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater the majority of them are just the HD texture mods and character overhauls available over at nexusmods, the upsampled/interpolated-to-60 cutscenes, stuff like that.
[2:34:55] <%Irridium> or KoF... FOR GIRLS
[2:34:55] <%gatorafan> KOF for girls, got it :)
[2:34:59] <+zaibatsu_member_333> were they
[2:35:01] <%RioGascar> like it sounds like a man uttering WORDS
[2:35:02] <$QueequegTheater> Atton is a trickster who crashes ships and is a harsh contrast to the previous goody two-shoes version, he really is Joseph
[2:35:03] <+prime_name> It's a nice beatem up
[2:35:29] <RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater the list is super long though since there's no "one button installs all" option, since mod creators don't play nice together.
[2:35:31] <Joestar1890> Jolee is still good tho
[2:35:32] <%jinking79> waiting on Rock and Samsho character r in now
[2:35:39] <%RioGascar> Kotor 1 party is like STAR WARS MOVIE cast
[2:35:40] <%DatAsuna> I hate mission
[2:35:43] <%alpacasintophats> so what Dark Ascension is a thing then?
[2:35:43] <%DatAsuna> and i hate zaalbar
[2:35:45] <gruulmagebeast> that should be a stream title "DESCENT INTO LIGHT"
[2:35:48] <%DatAsuna> and I hate bastilla
[2:35:50] <%awkwardl0ser> You just missed the Mark of the Wolves Terry drop still no Rock Howard though
[2:35:51] <$QueequegTheater> Mission is at least hot
[2:36:01] <+zaibatsu_member_333> Asuna why are you hating on mission
[2:36:01] <+fandomgod> Mission is fucking 14
[2:36:03] <MidnightBurst12> @queequegtheater and 14
[2:36:03] <notenoughgirls> mission is 14
[2:36:03] <%DatAsuna> And Juhani is eugh
[2:36:06] <+fandomgod> or 16 I think
[2:36:07] <Joestar1890> @QueequegTheater Isn't she supposed to be 14?
[2:36:07] <RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater she's also 14 though.
[2:36:08] <elspiceweasel> Jolee is best girl
[2:36:20] <%Irridium> god Atton is so much better than Carth
[2:36:20] <+FrenchTact1cs> She cant be both hott and underage
[2:36:21] <$QueequegTheater> Mission is also an alien and fictional
[2:36:25] <RubberFistFight> @fandomgod nope, she directly says "I'm not a kid, i'm 14 years old"
[2:36:26] <jorniev> kyle katarn
[2:36:26] <%TRILLTURBAN> Oh I can't WAIT for HK to weigh in on this exact topic
[2:36:30] <lotharrio> Carth is running around, naked and crying about his son on a planet filled with cannibals. Mission was murdered by her best friend. You mind controlled her best friend into a slave. You killed cat girl and Jo Lee.
[2:36:30] <DocMadfox> Dash Rendars for everyone!
[2:36:34] <%RioGascar> carth is the bioware default type
[2:36:35] <notenoughgirls> i think mission might be the only one with a confirmed age
[2:36:36] <%gatorafan> Oh, but childroids are wrong huh?
[2:36:36] <$QueequegTheater> KappaHD
[2:36:39] <jorniev> KYLE KATARN
[2:36:41] <%gatorafan> Kappa
[2:36:43] <gruulmagebeast> find someone who looks at you the way woolie looks at dash rendar
[2:36:46] <$QueequegTheater> @gatorafan I never said that
[2:36:49] <MidnightBurst12> @queequegtheater fair enough Kappa
[2:36:49] <DuoMaxwellGW> Kyle Katarns for everyone
[2:36:56] <%DatAsuna> Jolee exists to tell you about the exar kun shit
[2:37:05] <RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater I also installed the bastila romance mod for female player characters. Since I didn't want to play a dude, but I also wanted to corrupt bastila with my "dark side" Kappa
[2:37:07] <%DatAsuna> Oh I hate the bastilla pay off lol
[2:37:13] <jamesthebrave> Juhani!
[2:37:14] <$QueequegTheater> @RubberFistFight Nice
[2:37:15] <Lamokmok> poor Juhani
[2:37:17] <siamzero94> You killed Juhani
[2:37:18] <Joestar1890> Canderous is Canderous
[2:37:19] <%DatAsuna> Bastilla turns to the dark side for NOTHING
[2:37:23] <nivlac_555> lol
[2:37:25] <$QueequegTheater> Poor dead shitty Juhani
[2:37:28] <%startstoprepeat> i like that your party in kotor2 all kinda hate each other
[2:37:30] <+zaibatsu_member_333> . .
[2:37:32] <DestroyerPhoenix> cathars never catch a break
[2:37:32] <bear_breaker20> oops
[2:37:33] <+zaibatsu_member_333> Welp
[2:37:34] <%RioGascar> i really wish the game let you rock this party fully and not just have to pick 2 characters
[2:37:34] <zocano> Canderous of Clan Ordo.
[2:37:39] <MidnightBurst12> ...
[2:37:40] <%TRILLTURBAN> F

[2:37:52] <$QueequegTheater> F for my Killing Bites boner
[2:38:00] <giga_bit> And nobody cared
[2:38:01] <%DatAsuna> You can try to sell Juhani into slavery in kotor 1
[2:38:05] <MidnightBurst12> she is so much nothing
[2:38:06] <Valentinius_Anodyne> He does it all the time, it's great
[2:38:09] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus I think it was the Romeo and Juliet quest on Dantooine?
[2:38:14] <+FrenchTact1cs> juhani blows

[2:38:22] <jorniev> cando the mando
[2:38:23] <gruulmagebeast> you deleted her life
[2:38:24] <%RioGascar> @woolieversus so a question i want to ask woolie. are you playing this as just an LP or are you roleplaying? If you are trying to RP i would say keep in mind in character and out of character knowledge
[2:38:26] <%Exiliator> @WoolieVersus I liked your look in Uricksaladbar's new video woolieSMUG
[2:38:28] <Joestar1890> TBF, Juhani is optional
[2:38:30] <%DatAsuna> Juhani is the first gay character in all of star wars too. lol
[2:38:36] <bear_breaker20> may she rip and tear
[2:38:47] <jorniev> BTW pat RE part 6
[2:38:50] <$QueequegTheater> @zaibatsu_member_333 I don't know but I am definitely watching that one fight scene many times Kappa
[2:38:55] <%startstoprepeat> star wars's first lesbian until lucas arts made bioware take it out, very cool
[2:38:57] <%VCRUZZO> very slow start
[2:39:04] <%RioGascar> @datasuna And shes not “gay bait” if I remember right?

[0:04:00] <+kefkloud> Samsho! Samsho! Samsho!
[0:04:02] <Triplicat> review copy!!
[0:04:15] <@Menitta> Woolie will help this game sell MILLIONS of copies on Steam
[0:04:25] <%gatorafan> So, this means this copy doesn't come with the day 1 patch right?
[0:04:33] <iamtheTwitchghost> for a moment i forgot there was a demo and thought woolie already had the game LUL
[0:04:35] <Triplicat> if it's the same review copy nerdjosh got
[0:04:40] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Can_Do_Kamel
[0:04:47] <Triplicat> then it inexplicably already has the day 1 patch
[0:04:47] <+akira_chong> what song is this
[0:04:54] <jubejube56> Are we living in a world where darli dagger is both maximum woolie bait AND a good character?
[0:04:54] <Triplicat> which makes it like a day -7 patch

[0:06:44] <%gatorafan> Is this Samurai Showdown For Men? Kappa
[0:06:58] <+Prinnylordninjocity> I feel sick, this is independent of the stream’s delay
[0:07:07] <jubejube56> JSebz idk what religious rock you are reading from but it is bad for your health
[0:07:10] <%shmupdogjoe> I like to think that the new Samurai Showdown is specially formulated only for men and women anywhere on the kinsey scale
[0:07:11] <+RacingJon> bizWave all
[0:07:12] <@akuda_bar> @Prinnylordninjocity drink some ginger ale
[0:07:36] <%JSebz> @jubejube56 my religious rock is Traitors Requiem my dude
[0:07:44] <+Prinnylordninjocity> I don’t have any at the house but that’s a good idea
[0:07:46] <%shmupdogjoe> because I hope that I can have some hype ass "one hit and you fucking die" samurai showdown sword fighting actin with as many online opponents as... exist
[0:07:49] <+RacingJon> But my question is, what SamSho is Woolie playing?
[0:07:50] <jubejube56> Oh...nvm proceed as planned
[0:07:59] <%shmupdogjoe> so Samsho should be for everyone that likes bad motherfuckers stabbing each other

Thoughts?

[0:33:28] <%gatorafan> First complaint about the game, we kinda need more colors for the characters.
[0:33:28] <Nineball_Luce> Remember, the more hype you are, the more that goes wrong
[0:33:29] <thebmanishere> SNK is actively trying to take down the stream

[0:35:46] <CerberusDriver> cause I can think of one.
[0:35:52] <FatDragonQuest> from what I've heard, seen, and played, 1 was fine, 2 and 5 are the best, 3 is not good, 4 is ____, 6 is okay maybe??
[0:35:56] <Jontman42> Why does he need so many swords
[0:35:56] <+linkwolf4> SamSho is ALL Nooch baby.
[0:35:57] <BabyNaBackbrace> I still wish for Sekiro in Soul Calibur
[0:35:59] <CerberusDriver> imagine Jetstream Sam in this game.
[0:36:00] <Spavorkian> that is an irresponsible amount of swords
[0:36:03] <+paladinstarbuster> HER BAPS
[0:36:06] <FatDragonQuest> there was also a samurai shodown rpg on the NEOGEO
[0:36:09] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Darli's my favorite already

[0:36:15] <%jinking79> god the childhood comin in hard on this stage
[0:36:16] <FatDragonQuest> and it killed off one of the characters
[0:36:21] <+TopTieramisu> i hate how people keep saying this game looks like sf4. this game is way more stylized than sf4
[0:36:36] <FrustratedAF> but yeah yoshitora you have to do like 6 or so specific moves to unlock that last, long ass sword
[0:36:39] <%fFailureatlife> BIG DAMAGE
[0:36:40] <FatDragonQuest> holy fuck that health
[0:36:41] <jubejube56> Oh she does one of those hunting horn kicks

[0:37:24] <Guntanks_in_Space> @FrustratedAF yoshi can either do all the 6 sword attacks he has to bust out #7, or he can do his super desperation move
[0:37:31] <Cypher_Ranger_PhazON> Yo, you're meter depleted mid round.
[0:37:32] <SolGoodguy> yeah i wanna play yoshitora too
[0:37:33] <+Pookiedaexzile> Bih gotta cross up jump
[0:37:39] <FrustratedAF> and tam tam is some kinda unga bunga i guess
[0:37:48] <+TopTieramisu> @DingusMcBaseball i won't deny that it has a lot of similarities. but i don't agree with it being said in a disparaging manner. i think it's a better execution on what sf4 was going for
[0:37:53] <FrustratedAF> still need to buy the game tho :/ gotta get that season pass
[0:38:09] <FatDragonQuest> hitboxes babyyy
[0:38:11] <+Pookiedaexzile> Big Risk big reward

[0:57:32] <Guntanks_in_Space> ^
[0:57:33] <$Mighty_observer> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug oh boy what you got comming Kappa
[0:57:36] <Guntanks_in_Space> all it needs is just full rage
[0:57:38] <Triplicat> just full rage gauge
[0:57:47] <+Pookiedaexzile> Even the supers have mix ups
[0:57:47] <Triplicat> yeah super important to know this
[0:57:51] <@Menitta> "Conclusion" is the best round finish phrase
[0:57:57] <Guntanks_in_Space> they got rid of meditation here (and the weapon power meter)
[0:58:02] <rufus2k2> "did you know your eyes were dead" ??
[0:58:03] <+TopTieramisu> i love this game's full commitment to its aesthetic
[0:58:10] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah Jimmy's got it right lol
[0:58:11] <jubejube56> Did you know that your eyes were dead? Wat
[0:58:22] <+JakeSG> can you still rage burst?
[0:58:24] <$Mighty_observer> @rufus2k2 Jaden smit?
[0:58:27] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeh
[0:58:32] <%deadredeyez> @jubejube56 yes
[0:58:38] <+GraveLordJeff> @WoolieVersus random quetion is it normal for top players to charge you money for a autograph
[0:58:39] <Guntanks_in_Space> rage burst is still ABC any time
[0:58:42] <rufus2k2> @Mighty_observer :D
[0:58:51] <$Mighty_observer> lol
[0:58:59] <+Prinnylordninjocity> IS THAT SEANS SUPER???
[0:59:07] <Kaendorth> her moves are sick, but the wft isn't so cool
[0:59:25] <+Detectivemac9> darli's weapon is straight up a saw cleaver and it's buggin me
[0:59:30] <Triplicat> it's issen that you need to be in rage explosion for
[0:59:39] <jubejube56> So can you combo into the disarm super at all?
[0:59:44] <Triplicat> uhhh
[0:59:47] <jubejube56> Like off back throw
[0:59:55] <+TopTieramisu> @Detectivemac9 it's also a hammer and drill
[1:00:02] <%wolfofsound> Say "I need my king butterfly"
[1:00:03] <+Detectivemac9> what
[1:00:10] <Triplicat> it is comboable off high levels of deflect for sure but I don't think that's what you're asking for
[1:00:22] <Kaendorth> @TopTieramisu yeah, i saw a glimpse of that, how does she change?
[1:00:25] <+JakeSG> real question. can you still sudouku with 4632start?
[1:00:34] <+TopTieramisu> @Kaendorth specific moves or supers
[1:00:35] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Ground command throw
[1:00:49] <jubejube56> Well I guess getting it off a deflect is enough
[1:00:51] <+TopTieramisu> it just does. darli magic, i guess
[1:00:56] <%mistersups> woolieFABRICATION woolieFABRICATION
[1:00:59] <$Mighty_observer> soooooooooo, who da fuq is this yoshitora? im sure hes not a real tokugawa
[1:01:04] <+gurrren_lagannn> @woolieversus That just the command grab
[1:01:04] <Kaendorth> oj cool, does she keep it or is it just for the cinematic?
[1:01:05] <$Mighty_observer> he will be beheaded
[1:01:06] <+TheyTookMyBeard> early copy?
[1:01:07] <KingFossilFER> @WoolieVersus yoshi can do his air special move from a backdash or kara cancelling the overhead
[1:01:14] <Triplicat> you can get SSM off deflect which is going to blow everyone up week 1
[1:01:22] <Triplicat> or at least day 1
[1:01:35] <+TopTieramisu> yoshitora is an existing samsho character
[1:01:49] <Guntanks_in_Space> that also means... ukyo backdash firebird is a thing
[1:01:55] <Guntanks_in_Space> backdash tsubame rather
[1:02:02] <$Mighty_observer> @TheyTookMyBeard woolie is a big youtuber that has all the cloat
[1:02:04] <+TopTieramisu> tsubame gaeshi
[1:02:06] <President_valentine> back dash tsubame Kreygasm
[1:02:09] <PumpkinSong> I've missed having a "traditional" 2D game to get into BibleThump
[1:02:11] <COMB711> tthat shit is nuts with ukyo
[1:02:12] <+Pookiedaexzile> Dat foot tap doe
[1:02:16] <%jinking79> om dpad it tough
[1:02:17] <KingFossilFER> then maybe just the overhead in this game
[1:02:18] <Triplicat> he still has 2D tsubame IIRC
[1:02:21] <+TheyTookMyBeard> @Mighty_observer hes big RT boy now
[1:02:23] <Triplicat> or rather he has it
[1:02:26] <$Mighty_observer> @TopTieramisu really? why nobody play as him XD
[1:02:32] <+geobuster> buffer > backdash > button
[1:02:42] <jubejube56> Maybe it just isn’t a thing in this game?
[1:02:47] <$Mighty_observer> @TheyTookMyBeard or as we like to call him... a sell out
[1:02:47] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:02:52] <+gurrren_lagannn> it is a thi g
[1:02:53] <+solzan2000> I think yoshi has a cmd grab?
[1:02:55] <+gurrren_lagannn> thjng
[1:03:09] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah he has a cmd grab
[1:03:09] <+TopTieramisu> i always liked yoshitora. i think he was added in samsho 5?
[1:03:12] <Guntanks_in_Space> DP+Kick i think
[1:03:18] <+solzan2000> ok cool
[1:03:20] <Guntanks_in_Space> @TopTieramisu yup that's correct
[1:03:25] <Triplicat> @WoolieVersus if you just want to see it, restart, do his SSM round start so the opponent survives in the same round, then do the command
[1:03:33] <$Mighty_observer> never seen him
[1:03:36] <Triplicat> otherwise it'll just relock when the round ends
[1:03:50] <+TopTieramisu> @Mighty_observer he's like the main character of 5, i think
[1:03:52] <%TheSleepParty> Do they have Gaoh tho
[1:04:10] <$Mighty_observer> i didnt play samsho 5
[1:04:13] <+TopTieramisu> guess he's kind of like samsho's alex lol
[1:04:32] <+solzan2000> did they use the 7th sword attack?
[1:04:34] <Eternal_Harmony> cant wait for pc release
[1:04:57] <Triplicat> LMAO
[1:05:00] <%mistersups> THE FINAL POWER THAT SHOULD NOT BE USED
[1:05:00] <+solzan2000> there it is
[1:05:02] <Triplicat> and he can keep doing it
[1:05:05] <%TheSleepParty> im skeptical about pc release. their other snk games on steam have some janky netcord
[1:05:06] <jubejube56> Didn’t do command grab
[1:05:07] <krymzen5> dooope
[1:05:09] <+TopTieramisu> POWER GEYSER
[1:05:15] <KingFossilFER> @WoolieVersus the special moves you landed stay registered forever until you unlock the move
[1:05:16] <%GunterDriger6> woolieYE
[1:05:17] <rufus2k2> wait did darli get cut in half

[1:05:39] <Triplicat> yes
[1:05:40] <ElGordoSupreme> RIP Darli
[1:05:40] <krymzen5> does tht carry between rounds?
[1:05:44] <outrogabriel> yes, cross rounds
[1:05:44] <Triplicat> across rounds
[1:05:48] <KingFossilFER> @WoolieVersus yes across rounds
[1:05:50] <krymzen5> oh shit
[1:05:51] <%GunterDriger6> I LOVE this Character!
[1:05:51] <+solzan2000> I heard it stays
[1:05:57] <+TopTieramisu> nah, that was like igniz's super from kof11
[1:06:00] <$Mighty_observer> Thats the move that put woolie in the hospital
[1:06:07] <jubejube56> That explains why he could do the command grab in round two
[1:06:15] <+solzan2000> it makes sense since you need to hit them
[1:06:22] <+TopTieramisu> i mean kof '0`
[1:06:27] <+TopTieramisu> '01*
[1:06:35] <President_valentine> They also gave Ukyo Judgment cut end

[1:18:01] <%fFailureatlife> Jebaited
[1:18:01] <Vashido22> Pog
[1:18:03] <Guntanks_in_Space> it wasn't just the duff special yo
[1:18:03] <MainMan_Jonadiah> You thought she was done?
[1:18:15] <%gatorafan> Personally I'm a sucker for these unconventional swords. woolieGASM
[1:18:23] <+Sayie> Darli doesn't give a fuck if you block, she want's that hit
[1:18:31] <Vashido22> Galford's va sounds so familiar
[1:18:36] <+thespikespiegel> !discord
[1:18:45] <rufus2k2> that pirouette kick is so delicate yet strong
[1:18:57] <$Mighty_observer> @Vashido22 sounds like a main charecter...
[1:19:07] <Guntanks_in_Space> internet says Galford's Wataru Komada
[1:19:11] <jubejube56> Galford already making himself look like an online menace
[1:19:29] <CanadianWolverine> Unconventional sword? It looks like a damn over sized pull saw
[1:19:30] <tungstenviper> @vashido22 it sounds like Chipp from GG to me
[1:19:31] <%Solidnick18> oh
[1:19:36] <Guntanks_in_Space> kind reminder you can cancel the "weapon recoil" animation
[1:19:38] <$Mighty_observer> @Guntanks_in_Space wataru from that mecha show with the dragon?
[1:20:00] <Guntanks_in_Space> hang on
[1:20:10] <+TopTieramisu> that's weird
[1:20:18] <MainMan_Jonadiah> When you say "weapon recoil," do you mean you can cancel attack recovery?
[1:20:35] <tungstenviper> why only 3?
[1:20:40] <krymzen5> i think its when u bounce off
[1:20:43] <cerazor01> I think Woolie would be better as somebody else.
[1:20:52] <%gatorafan> Day 1 Earthquake will be fun to see.
[1:20:55] <Guntanks_in_Space> nope, Komada's a relatively new one
[1:21:04] <Vashido22> I want to use my girl Shiki so bad
[1:21:06] <beatie_g> is this a demo?
[1:21:06] <+TopTieramisu> wait does samsho not have true autoblock after the first hit?
[1:21:08] <%CaptainPileDriver> awe damn
[1:21:13] <jubejube56> That was just a 2 hit combo
[1:21:19] <KingFossilFER> when your attack is blocked and you are in that recoil animation, you can cancel it into a special moves or defelct
[1:21:20] <$Mighty_observer> yeah i saw, im disapointed

[1:26:42] <%mistersups> Dignified is a good term for the pace.
[1:26:46] <+Joey_JoestarXD> everything looks so powerful
[1:26:47] <%jinking79> how is Genjuro and Iori not related
[1:26:48] <+TopTieramisu> this game needs a character with norio wakamoto's voice
[1:26:57] <+SaltySombrero> @OmegaWeltall right now's a good time to try. One of the best in the series, SamSho V Special is on sale (or free on fightcade)
[1:26:58] <+MutedMimic> LUL
[1:26:59] <+TopTieramisu> @jinking79 who knows?
[1:26:59] <+Joey_JoestarXD> timeout? Pog
[1:27:01] <Guntanks_in_Space> @Mighty_observer the dude's also been Genjuro for a long-ass time too so it's fair game lol
[1:27:02] <+TopTieramisu> maybe they are
[1:27:03] <%CaptainPileDriver> this game still uses snk motions like in KOF doesn't it
[1:27:10] <Guntanks_in_Space> for the most part @CaptainPileDriver
[1:27:19] <$Mighty_observer> @TopTieramisu well if you see any charecter wearing RED
[1:27:20] <+geobuster> Genjuro's DP looks majestic
[1:27:26] <Guntanks_in_Space> like, SDMs are f,hcf+C+D i think? but no pretzels
[1:27:27] <+OmegaWeltall> ah cool, might check it out SeemsGood
[1:27:27] <rufus2k2> @TopTieramisu apparently it did, Golba
[1:27:28] <PumpkinSong> I first played this on Game Gear so it has been ruined forever
[1:27:36] <%mistersups> I want to see a drinking match between Genjuro and Darli.
[1:27:37] <%Solidnick18> what
[1:27:38] <+OmegaWeltall> i kind alike how its slow and methodical
[1:27:39] <$cherubs_anonymous> YOU CAN HOLD IT
[1:27:43] <Guntanks_in_Space> for the record, the GB Samsho games are dope
[1:27:48] <Vashido22> Charlotte is so much fun in V
[1:27:49] <%Solidnick18> that's nuts
[1:27:50] <WG101> @mistersups daril would win, hands down
[1:27:50] <%CaptainPileDriver> okay, i don't much care for snk motions on pad but this game is much slower so
[1:27:53] <%Solidnick18> YEAH
[1:27:53] <Guntanks_in_Space> yes it crosses up, but you can still block it
[1:27:53] <%SkaiVibration> SkaiVibration subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 6 month streak! SAMSHO TIME woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM

[1:28:06] <Guntanks_in_Space> genjuro fuckin' rulles
[1:28:06] <$Mighty_observer> @Guntanks_in_Space i guess, but he goes from playing a evil muscle dude to playing a evil muscle dude with a sword
[1:28:06] <+Joey_JoestarXD> if that came out a little sooner might have been a kill
[1:28:19] <%Solidnick18> woolie is sick
[1:28:20] <Guntanks_in_Space> dat boi

[1:28:41] <zerovect0r> Genjuro dunked on Charlotte
[1:28:47] <Guntanks_in_Space> the funny thing about Samurai Iori is that, Iori and Kyo's ancestors showed up in the Samsho RPG
[1:28:50] <CraZ80> @WoolieVersus is this a review copy?
[1:28:51] <$Mighty_observer> @TopTieramisu only the most menly of men
[1:28:57] <Vashido22> Wasn't Charlotte in love with haohmaru or something? I don't remember a lot of samsho's story
[1:28:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> YOSHITORA
[1:29:01] <rufus2k2> Yo bring back Golba for this game, he was voiced by Wakamoto
[1:29:02] <+Joey_JoestarXD> shiki got teleports
[1:29:04] <Guntanks_in_Space> so you got Kyo rocking Saisyu's garb, and Iori with something similar but with the Yagami crescent moon emblem
[1:29:06] <President_valentine> @vashido22 yeah

[1:29:26] <rufus2k2> isn't Charlotte generally on the look out for any strong man

[1:34:19] <rufus2k2> OHOHOHO
[1:34:25] <%fFailureatlife> NO SAD DOG
[1:34:26] <Guntanks_in_Space> skewered
[1:34:26] <$Mighty_observer> @TopTieramisu in medieval times that means 25
[1:34:29] <gammongaming11> man this is a lot more my jam then stuff like DBZ, not 10 minute combos, just hits into damage
[1:34:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> earthquake next
[1:34:29] <%wolfofsound> @WoolieVersus woolie how stiff ARE your pants from all this darli play?
[1:34:30] <$Mighty_observer> lordji1Cooked
[1:34:35] <%fFailureatlife> shes no darli
[1:34:35] <rufus2k2> poppy gotta bury her master :(
[1:34:44] <%MightyMaxT> Galford just sounds like Chipp Zanuff and Charlotte sounds like KoF King. Are they the same voice actors?
[1:34:44] <rufus2k2> darli is darli
[1:34:49] <jubejube56> She is okay
[1:34:51] <Thenuclearwalrus> @CanadianWolverine There are special sheathes that allow it, usually the side has a cut out of it, kinda defeats the purpose of a sheath though
[1:34:51] <+TopTieramisu> @Mighty_observer lol. i was talking about the character from kof
[1:35:09] <Guntanks_in_Space> funnily enough no
[1:35:13] <$Mighty_observer> @TopTieramisu ahhhhhh
[1:35:21] <rufus2k2> @MightyMaxT seems to be a new guy, funnily enough he does a bunch of foreigner characters in anime
[1:35:22] <Sarumarine> Machine Gun Dog, hahah
[1:35:23] <Vashido22> Good old SNK motions
[1:35:26] <Guntanks_in_Space> @MightyMaxT like, Char's got a new VA but she USED to be voiced by King's VA in the older games
[1:35:40] <rufus2k2> one of his credits is AMERICAN MAN
[1:35:45] <Vashido22> @Guntanks_in_Space the double waifu energy was too powerful
[1:35:46] <%fFailureatlife> King Kreygasm
[1:35:47] <krymzen5> gonna take me a bit to get used to snk motions again
[1:35:48] <Vashido22> so they had to change it
[1:35:49] <Guntanks_in_Space> Afumi Hashi (Char's new VA) replaced Harumi Ikoma (Char's former VA, also King/Blue Mary and what have you)
[1:35:51] <gammongaming11> you don't need a special sheeth for your sword if it's short
[1:35:55] <@Menitta> Man Charlotte is so cool

[1:37:04] <rufus2k2> let artorias get back his good sword arm tho
[1:37:17] <Guntanks_in_Space> also kind reminder that Galford isn't the only American ninja in this game
[1:37:20] <$Mighty_observer> LUL
[1:37:24] <Triplicat> SO SCARE
[1:37:25] <Guntanks_in_Space> basically Earthquake is from Texas
[1:37:28] <%gatorafan> reminder that Andrew Jackson is a character in this series.
[1:37:35] <%MightyMaxT> It even sounds like he's saying "Alpha Wave" like Chipp
[1:37:36] <%SkaiVibration> CONCLUSION THO?

[1:39:21] <Vashido22> just noticed
[1:39:23] <+QuestJefferson> Is Galford's VA the same guy who does the announcer voice in FEXL? Sounds real similar
[1:39:25] <Guntanks_in_Space> sen was a bit over-the-top with the dismemberments

[1:40:18] <Vashido22> yep LUL
[1:40:18] <$Mighty_observer> TACHIBANA? no wonder hes always dying

[1:40:27] <Sarumarine> The Fuck-Up meter
[1:40:32] <+QuestJefferson> Thank you rufus
[1:40:33] <Guntanks_in_Space> Last Blade was more combo-happy compared to this
[1:40:39] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Apple-tech
[1:40:41] <Guntanks_in_Space> while Samsho was always "make this fucking hit count"
[1:40:42] <jubejube56> Isn’t there a simple fighting game that does that?
[1:40:45] <+heyitsdenzel_> Lets go Vergil
[1:40:49] <President_valentine> Apples
[1:40:50] <+EndgameContent> Doctors hate it!
[1:40:53] <+TopTieramisu> @Guntanks_in_Space fuuuuck. i want a new last blade
[1:41:03] <krymzen5> mvc3, just screw lifebars
[1:41:06] <%jinking79> for 100 of years
[1:41:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> BISHI BISHI
[1:41:11] <+TopTieramisu> or put hibiki in samsho
[1:41:12] <$Mighty_observer> a apple a day didnt help him
[1:41:12] <SolGoodguy> Ukyo has tuberculosis?
[1:41:14] <Guntanks_in_Space> there's the backdash Tsubame
[1:41:14] <+TopTieramisu> i'd be fine with that
[1:41:18] <Vashido22> @SolGoodguy yeah
[1:41:22] <Guntanks_in_Space> @SolGoodguy yes, he's kinda been dealing with that
[1:41:23] <rufus2k2> @SolGoodguy yeah refuses to die tho
[1:41:24] <President_valentine> thats a godlike move
[1:41:25] <+m__w> have we confirmed or denied 2D comboing into TK Tsubame?
[1:41:26] <SolGoodguy> damn dude thats rough
[1:41:31] <+solzan2000> hes been ill for 30 years
[1:41:34] <%fFailureatlife> can we get yoshimitsu as a guest character Kappa
[1:41:38] <%gatorafan> No wonder he's dying if he keeps all the doctors away with those apples daedra1DerpyTibs
[1:41:41] <Guntanks_in_Space> hmmmm, i'm sure someone's tested 2D into backdash Tsubame
[1:41:41] <rufus2k2> also very faithful to his wife
[1:41:42] <+SaltySombrero> Ukyo fiighint the good fight
[1:41:46] <SolGoodguy> yfw when you learn a character has tuberculosis and the treatment for it only was created in 1900
[1:41:49] <rufus2k2> which is why he cuts and runs from the fangirls
[1:41:50] <SolGoodguy> BibleThump
[1:41:53] <+geobuster> Ukyo wastes food, don't be like Ukyo
[1:41:54] <$Mighty_observer> the lightning fast 1 slash samurai thats fastly dying
[1:42:02] <+TopTieramisu> @gatorafan the apples are why he's survived over a decade with TB
[1:42:03] <jubejube56> I can see why the ladies go after Ukyo now
[1:42:11] <SolGoodguy> he's moe
[1:42:19] <+m__w> I would be very surprised if Ukyo 2D can combo into TK Tsubame but I'm curious
[1:42:21] <%shmupdogjoe> Ladies like a dude who coughs up blood
[1:42:22] <Guntanks_in_Space> also fun trivia: Ukyo was supposed to be Haohmaru's rival (like how we got Musashi vs Kojiro), but then Genjuro showed up
[1:42:30] <CanadianWolverine> Can she cut the apple too?
[1:42:40] <Sarumarine> Nice roll
[1:42:45] <SolGoodguy> ukyo has a very kojiro look indeed
[1:42:45] <$Mighty_observer> @jubejube56 and as soon as they get him he dies in their arms, makes them extra hot
[1:42:54] <President_valentine> tsubame can reflect projectiles
[1:42:57] <runningfleet> ukyo is the main rival in samsho 1
[1:42:59] <rufus2k2> the range on that stab!
[1:43:00] <+TopTieramisu> @Guntanks_in_Space yeah. he basically got the Paul v Kazuya treatment
[1:43:02] <Guntanks_in_Space> Samurais are but just Bigger Swallows - Ukyo Tachibana, probably
[1:43:04] <%wolfofsound> ukyo pulling some kenshin shit
[1:43:06] <Triplicat> 甘い
[1:43:09] <+MutedMimic> PogChamp
[1:43:20] <$Mighty_observer> well he was already dead so...
[1:43:22] <SolGoodguy> man the trailers were really lessened with the blood
[1:43:22] <tungstenviper> AUREVOIR!!
[1:43:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> nothing ruins an online game like a the other guy with a mic
[1:43:22] <KingFossilFER> dash B crosses up
[1:43:37] <krymzen5> all u did was make his disease faster
[1:43:38] <PumpkinSong> @wolfofsound Allegedly?
[1:43:39] <SolGoodguy> glad to see there's still the slicing in half mechanic n' shit
[1:43:53] <%gatorafan> Fear not the man who practices a thousand slashes once, but the man who Tsubame Gaeshi a thousand times daedra1DerpyTibs
[1:44:05] <%wolfofsound> @PumpkinSong kenshin not watsuki
[1:44:07] <tigerarar> the whf
[1:44:09] <+SaltySombrero> super duper
[1:44:14] <PumpkinSong> fair enough
[1:44:16] <tigerarar> wft
[1:44:23] <$Mighty_observer> To much french
[1:44:32] <Triplicat> 🥖
[1:44:36] <%shmupdogjoe> I dunno, that guy probably learned some interesting things doing 10000 different slashes
[1:44:36] <$Mighty_observer> speak the lords ENGLISH
[1:44:58] <krymzen5> sorry, i don't speak COWARD
[1:45:31] <$Mighty_observer> @krymzen5 isnt that french tho? Kappa

[1:45:34] <%fFailureatlife> charlotte op pls nerf
[1:45:34] <+SaltySombrero> there is natural chipdeath
[1:45:36] <rufus2k2> bet we'll see a reversal update in the near future
[1:45:39] <KingFossilFER> @WoolieVersus special moves and supers chip. When unarmed everything chips
[1:45:45] <krymzen5> @Mighty_observer yes, yes it is LUL
[1:45:46] <+SaltySombrero> However, if you're unarmed, Normals do chip damage. This is pretty important
[1:46:00] <$Mighty_observer> LUL
[1:46:02] <%fFailureatlife> which makes sense tbh
[1:46:14] <rufus2k2> dat after image tho
[1:46:16] <jubejube56> I think if a Japanese symbol appears where the combo counter normally goes, that is a sign of a proper punish
[1:46:22] <jubejube56> Just from what I can see
[1:46:24] <@Menitta> I'm bummed this comes out in June. There are too many games out this month woolieDATTEBAYO

[1:50:49] <Haiizo> os cara da ban se fica falando em BR aqui ?
[1:50:51] <%fFailureatlife> tam-tam is monkaS
[1:50:56] <Tajy_Venom> does anyone remember the historical reference of haohmaru vs ukyo and the stage being night time? i think it had to do with musashi being late to a duel to someone ukyo was influenced by. was it something like that?
[1:51:04] <krymzen5> Shiji was a char i def wanted in
[1:51:06] <@Menitta> This game and stream shows me how little I know about Sam Sho
[1:51:16] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Yo! That's a big man!
[1:51:20] <rufus2k2> Tam Tam with the manlet respect
[1:51:25] <$Mighty_observer> @mistersups well is he actually coughing or is he looking at some pictures?
[1:51:26] <%mistersups> Faust from Guilty Gear?
[1:51:27] <RadShiro> THAT MAN IS A UNIT
[1:51:29] <%fFailureatlife> thats one big man baby
[1:51:30] <ahame94> what in the goddamn piillar man is he
[1:51:31] <TigerClaws12> holy hips batman
[1:51:41] <%wolfofsound> @Tajy_Venom he was late to a duel so the sun would be at his back making his opponent take a disadvantage
[1:51:43] <%jinking79> does his little sis show up on his victory?
[1:51:45] <+RowenCleric> my dude is bigger than the damn bear in the background
[1:51:46] <Guntanks_in_Space> @Tajy_Venom the quintessential timer scam really. Musashi intentionally went late for his duel with Kojiro so that the sun is behind him and Kojiro would be blinded
[1:51:46] <Haiizo> iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

[1:52:19] <Guntanks_in_Space> also let's not forget the part with the sharpened oar
[1:52:22] <Tajy_Venom> was that what the stage being night in the original was referencing when they are matched?
[1:52:31] <%mistersups> @Mighty_observer he hid the pictures in his lungs.

[1:54:04] <%mistersups> More like a toned down Faust
[1:54:06] <Guntanks_in_Space> he's kind of a jackass
[1:54:18] <Guntanks_in_Space> PAGNA PAGNA
[1:54:21] <jubejube56> Morrigan flashbacks

[1:55:04] <KingFossilFER> wan fu?
[1:55:14] <@Menitta> I remember Tam Tam from Saltybet woolieREMEMBERS
[1:55:19] <$Mighty_observer> @rufus2k2 nope, get ready for more nintendo warriors
[1:55:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> saltybet teaches me many things about a life bar
[1:55:30] <Guntanks_in_Space> Wan Fu did have a similar sword
[1:55:35] <@Menitta> boy does it @CaptainPileDriver
[1:55:36] <Guntanks_in_Space> but later on he uses an uprooted pillar
[1:55:38] <rufus2k2> also Amakusa returning to show Menat lovers what's up
[1:55:46] <Guntanks_in_Space> Amakusa was the OG Ball Handler
[1:55:49] <%rhymeslikedimes> Are they playing the 8f or 4f lag version..?
[1:55:55] <%CaptainPileDriver> god i've lost so much saltybucks so fast
[1:55:56] <Guntanks_in_Space> Menat and Viola owe it to him lol
[1:56:08] <krymzen5> i think the 4f is a day 1 patch but idk
[1:56:10] <$Mighty_observer> i dont know if this is racist...
[1:56:20] <rufus2k2> @Mighty_observer my face when Fire Emblem characters get in before him NotLikeThis
[1:56:22] <%mistersups> Hiiiips
[1:56:28] <MainMan_Jonadiah> I don't know why, but seeing Tam tam's mouth under the mask is really weird to me.
[1:56:41] <$Mighty_observer> @rufus2k2 thats about right
[1:57:04] <DSD24> @MainMan_Jonadiah I mean its weird seeing any facial features of a character if they wear a mask all the time
[1:57:39] <切捨御免> WOO WOO WOOOO
[1:57:39] <DSD24> Big Damge
[1:57:40] <$Mighty_observer> dats racist
[1:57:42] <rufus2k2> @MainMan_Jonadiah I think in the 2d games it was more of a full mask but now with SUPER TECH you can give it more detail
[1:58:17] <%mistersups> NOM NOM NOM
[1:58:20] <rufus2k2> that's so sick
[1:58:24] <$Mighty_observer> dats extremly racist
[1:58:30] <DSD24> Shiki's really cool
[1:58:33] <rufus2k2> man's gotta eat
[1:58:48] <rufus2k2> I wonder if Tam Tam will come back..
[1:58:55] <krymzen5> we'd all eat shiki if we could chat Kappa
[1:58:58] <Guntanks_in_Space> you mean cham cham?
[1:59:01] <President_valentine> Mean Cham Cham
[1:59:05] <rufus2k2> sorry yes, Cham Cham
[1:59:06] <$Mighty_observer> @rufus2k2 i heard hes still on a boat
[1:59:22] <rufus2k2> dat throw
[1:59:27] <rufus2k2> also Shiki got some bounce
[1:59:35] <El_Desperad0> wack
[1:59:35] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:59:57] <$Mighty_observer> @rufus2k2 is this game japanese?
[1:59:57] <krymzen5> p happy they kept the blood. ik it's a small thing but i love it
[2:00:01] <%wolfofsound> LUL
[2:00:07] <President_valentine> Her personality is also based on Rei
[2:00:17] <rufus2k2> @Mighty_observer inorite
[2:00:20] <@Menitta> LUL
[2:00:20] <DSD24> Not all waifus have heterochromeia
[2:00:30] <MainMan_Jonadiah> All the good ones do
[2:00:35] <%mistersups> If you get hit... It's your fault!
[2:00:37] <%gatorafan> isn't she also super pregnant by Satan or something?
[2:00:42] <krymzen5> i'm sorry for starting this but
[2:00:50] <krymzen5> Asuka> Rei
[2:00:51] <%MightyMaxT> Could Strider-Hiryu work as a SamSho guest? Or would he have too many moves with the Options
[2:00:53] <$Mighty_observer> @rufus2k2 just being alive means bounce... and sometimes being dead means BIG BOUNCE
[2:00:56] <Guntanks_in_Space> i forget her lore but i don't think she's super preggo by satan
[2:00:57] <rufus2k2> that's a really good victory howl
[2:01:02] <+m__w> not every waifu has heterochromia, but every girl with heterochromia is a waifu
[2:01:10] <Guntanks_in_Space> but the cult she fought for had some really fucked up ways to make giant abomination babies
[2:01:10] <MainMan_Jonadiah> @krymzen5 You're sorry for starting THE TRUTH?!
[2:01:16] <DSD24> Look at that cool bear
[2:01:18] <President_valentine> she does have a child but i forget who the father is
[2:01:20] <@Menitta> WOW
[2:01:22] <+SaltySombrero> You can't escape!
[2:01:25] <TomCrimson> YEYEYEEEE
[2:01:27] <rufus2k2> that dance!
[2:01:31] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> spin to win
[2:01:31] <tungstenviper> GET FUKD
[2:01:34] <Guntanks_in_Space> silly fan canon states that she's Genjuro's mom
[2:01:35] <Guntanks_in_Space> as a joke
[2:01:41] <ameraaaaaa> is this shamsho
[2:01:48] <krymzen5> @MainMan_Jonadiah they rejected me, because i speak the truth!
[2:01:52] <rufus2k2> no this is patrick!
[2:01:59] <jubejube56> Sudden realization tam tam wears the woolie colours
[2:02:01] <PumpkinSong> I do not want to fight Tam Tam
[2:02:14] <Guntanks_in_Space> oh yeah lol
[2:02:18] <+SaltySombrero> It's okay, just fight the Green Hell man
[2:02:21] <Guntanks_in_Space> Tam's rocking the Woolie motif
[2:02:28] <ameraaaaaa> who's woolie's character
[2:02:33] <President_valentine> Darli
[2:02:34] <切捨御免> AWOOWOOWOOO
[2:02:40] <+Binary_Fireball> FLEX HARD
[2:02:44] <ahame94> His Namesake, Darli
[2:02:47] <krymzen5> Tam Tam looks like he'll be a problem online
[2:02:48] <$Mighty_observer> for a proto space marine, TAM TAM is fast
[2:02:51] <rufus2k2> I like that win quote from before telling Shiki get some sun
[2:02:51] <MainMan_Jonadiah> What's that touhou shit with the skulls?!
[2:02:55] <%mistersups> HitBOX
[2:02:58] <DSD24> Is Tam Tam like 8 feet tall or something?
[2:02:58] <ameraaaaaa> woolie bait
[2:03:08] <+SaltySombrero> Tam's real tall
[2:03:11] <+SaltySombrero> so maybe
[2:03:11] <rufus2k2> @Mighty_observer you ever see the Astartes clips on youtube? Space marines ARE really fast
[2:03:14] <President_valentine> Something like that
[2:03:20] <%wolfofsound> tam tam comes up and slap's your girl? What do you do? What DO you do?!
[2:03:29] <haveswordmuststing> @dsd24 taller than shiki crouched, at least 10 feet
[2:03:30] <%wolfofsound> slaps*
[2:03:31] <$Mighty_observer> @DSD24 well hes twice the size of everybody else so...
[2:03:34] <krymzen5> she's his girl now
[2:03:35] <jubejube56> So tam tam is a cross between a tohou character and Yoshimitsu?
[2:03:35] <President_valentine> I think Earthquake might be slightly taller
[2:03:36] <rufus2k2> tam tam dance is good
[2:03:37] <MainMan_Jonadiah> According to the SNK wiki, Tam Tam is 9' 4"
[2:03:39] <EnlightenedKramer> die I guess
[2:03:42] <ameraaaaaa> @dsd24 no tam tam is 80 foot tall and everyone's a kaiju
[2:03:46] <$Mighty_observer> @rufus2k2 true, and big
[2:03:54] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Earthquake is 9'6"
[2:03:56] <DSD24> @MainMan_Jonadiah Man I was so close on that guess
[2:04:21] <%gatorafan> Tam Tam's size is "bigger than you" Kappa
[2:04:24] <+SaltySombrero> Earthquake is fat evil
[2:04:30] <DSD24> I like the character select screen
[2:04:32] <+yoshkosh20> oh shit. is samurai showdown out now?
[2:04:34] <rufus2k2> fat evil NINJA

[2:05:16] <%gatorafan> My boy Hanzo PogChamp
[2:05:25] <$Mighty_observer> probably the only real warrior in any samurai game
[2:05:35] <DSD24> Yellow Hanzo looks awesome
[2:05:44] <krymzen5> Haohmaru needs more love. such a good shoto
[2:05:44] <rufus2k2> scorpion hanzo
[2:05:46] <EnlightenedKramer> if only Tam Tam had a standing stance if he fought another Tam Ta
[2:05:52] <%MightyMaxT> Don't look at Hanzo mains, don't shake their hands
[2:05:57] <cherrycottontail> that hanzo cant see shit with that stance
[2:06:02] <haveswordmuststing> theres a lot of echo fighters with entire new sprites
[2:06:18] <rufus2k2> that new commercial with Segata Sanshiro as Haohmaru was OD
[2:06:42] <%buildtofail> buildtofail subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 6 months! It’s been a fun six months, thanks for teaching fighting games.

[2:22:25] <rufus2k2> multi hit grab WTF
[2:22:26] <brokenroberto> @cerberusdriver ukyo to a certain extent
[2:22:26] <SolGoodguy> yashamaru is so edgy
[2:22:33] <%CaptainPileDriver> the fat to thicc that the edge won't cut
[2:22:35] <krymzen5> i'd say ukyos toolset is more vergil
[2:22:39] <CerberusDriver> does anyone have a judgement cut or slash
[2:22:40] <SolGoodguy> shiki and him are the edgelords first picks
[2:22:45] <MainMan_Jonadiah> I thought Yashamaru was just an edgelord at first, but his design has grown on me, he's pretty sick.
[2:22:47] <%shmupdogjoe> I wonder if it is physically possible to get so fat that it gets harder to kill you with a sword irl
[2:22:48] <brokenroberto> @cerberusdriver ukyo

[2:23:30] <Triplicat> that shit looks like Ken's DP in persona
[2:23:31] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Is it a tengu motif? I thought Tengu was the long nose.
[2:23:39] <T_Sasquatch> don't leave, it's my faultttt

[2:33:15] <MainMan_Jonadiah> She's not my cup of tea, but I'm sure zoner-type players will like her, and she's cute.
[2:33:17] <+Spider1991> I hope she's high tier just to pissed everyone off
[2:33:22] <DSD24> As much as I like her design I never really like that personality in fighters
[2:33:22] <rufus2k2> Hokey smokes
[2:33:29] <+SaltySombrero> @Mighty_observer i do believe it. I like all the girls in this game
[2:33:33] <%KingLlama1> this game has too many waifus
[2:33:35] <+solzan2000> Wu is a problem

[2:34:10] <%gatorafan> She looks story relevant, since she doesn't seem to want to be here, but she is.
[2:34:14] <krymzen5> 4 if we count dlc, but still not many tbh
[2:34:14] <%shmupdogjoe> But they won’t ruin your laifu if they aren’t real
[2:34:25] <+SaltySombrero> lol

[2:38:19] <%fFailureatlife> yoshi is way less kabuki than this guy
[2:38:20] <+SaltySombrero> the counters are counters, check the movelist
[2:38:20] <rufus2k2> dude the pattern on kyoshiro's skin is slick
[2:38:24] <+Spider1991> There's a low and high counter I think
[2:38:24] <krymzen5> @Pookiedaexzile its not the same man BibleThump
[2:38:24] <$Mighty_observer> sbfpBlue nice naganagitabaga
[2:38:32] <MainMan_Jonadiah> This man jumps REAL high
[2:38:36] <%shmupdogjoe> 236+K, Kyoshiro! Make the frog eat him!
[2:38:45] <%wolfofsound> white men CAN jump
[2:38:46] <Saltmeisterr> that's a dp
[2:38:48] <rufus2k2> with a single foot even
[2:39:06] <+EightFootOctopus> he jumps high cuz he has big buttons, and he should still have his down slash in air spin
[2:39:06] <$Mighty_observer> @wolfofsound only in anime, not IRL
[2:39:18] <%wolfofsound> @Mighty_observer FeelsBadMan
[2:39:19] <%shmupdogjoe> yagyu jubei, the bad guy of Lone Wolf and Cub!

[2:39:50] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Man, they gotta put Ocha-Maro Karakuri in this game! That's MY hope.
[2:40:04] <Guntanks_in_Space> Getting out of Fighting Games: Kabuki Warriors

[2:40:35] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> sbfpDattebayo
[2:40:36] <+EightFootOctopus> frog used to be busted in V special, did so much damage
[2:40:37] <$Mighty_observer> Woolies new main
[2:40:40] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Wow, he's straight-up Jiraiya
[2:41:02] <+TheyCallMeVawn> That water effect looks great
[2:41:06] <$Mighty_observer> @MainMan_Jonadiah he has the child porn vol 1-9999
[2:41:14] <%shmupdogjoe> I did like spamming that frog but me and my friends didn’t really know how to play samsho 5 special
[2:41:20] <krymzen5> yea, special dmg seems nerfed in general. which i'm ok with
[2:41:24] <Guntanks_in_Space> @EightFootOctopus i believe Meaty Frog setups were a thing
[2:41:28] <%wolfofsound> @MainMan_Jonadiah he's also kumadori from OP
[2:41:39] <+EightFootOctopus> down slash in air should also be a crossup
[2:41:58] <SouthPawPad> wait how is he playing this?
[2:41:59] <+EightFootOctopus> and you can down slash after bacdash
[2:42:04] <krymzen5> glad they didn't bring back stamina
[2:42:05] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:42:06] <%fFailureatlife> yooooooooo
[2:42:11] <GoldeNOVA> Where did that archetype come from? I imagine some old Japanese tale.
[2:42:13] <MainMan_Jonadiah> @wolfofsound Had to google to remember which character that was, but you're ABSOLUTELY right.
[2:42:22] <%fFailureatlife> kabuki theatre
[2:42:42] <+RoboBro1212> yooooOOOOO~
[2:42:45] <%shmupdogjoe> kabuki was well known for trained giant frogs back in the day
[2:42:50] <$Mighty_observer> @GoldeNOVA A old japanes shaman basically
[2:42:58] <+SaltySombrero> Kaiswer...WAVE
[2:43:12] <Hacerous> dont litter
[2:43:16] <GoldeNOVA> He vanished?
[2:43:20] <paptert> dude just casually cuts him in half
[2:43:24] <+MutedMimic> LUL
[2:43:28] <+solzan2000> lol
[2:43:32] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Damn Jubei, that's cold
[2:43:32] <%wolfofsound> @MainMan_Jonadiah it's pretty uncanny
[2:43:33] <%fFailureatlife> so how come kof14 looked kinda wack but this looks sick
[2:43:44] <jetswerve> money
[2:43:47] <krymzen5> the punchy guy from 4 special could be cool just for variety
[2:43:49] <$Mighty_observer> because japan doesnt like body horror, until they REALLY like body horroe
[2:43:52] <+TopTieramisu> man, jubei's so cool that i wish there was a younger version of him
[2:43:52] <+Rabbitmage> Jubei crosses swords around men.
[2:43:52] <Quikanims> jubei is a savage
[2:43:58] <+SaltySombrero> Jiimmy, win using only st.B with Charlotte
[2:44:04] <+SaltySombrero> use the nooch
[2:44:17] <+solzan2000> this stage is a stage!
[2:44:24] <BeijiWeng> Imagine next Kof, Thank you LUL
[2:44:26] <DSD24> @fFailureatlife Probably because KOF 14 was their first game in a long time whereas this probably got more time
[2:44:29] <+TopTieramisu> this stage actually makes me think of sfxt
[2:44:32] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Oh shit! This stage IS a stage!
[2:44:40] <+EightFootOctopus> yea kyoshiro eats shit if he whiffs specials lol
[2:44:41] <+SaltySombrero> @fFailureatlife XIV was SNK's first voyage into 3D.
[2:44:48] <rufus2k2> froggy
[2:44:48] <+TopTieramisu> kof 14 was snk getting used to 3d
[2:44:51] <DSD24> Get them ankles
[2:44:51] <krymzen5> i wish this stage was a lil more stage tbh
[2:44:55] <%fFailureatlife> right, yeah that makes sense
[2:44:58] <+TopTieramisu> SNK hasn't even begun to peak
[2:45:03] <BeijiWeng> I'm pretty sure the last 3d game snk did was probably Samsho 64
[2:45:10] <BeijiWeng> @TopTieramisu True
[2:45:16] <suspence15> Play my favorite blue wolf boy
[2:45:18] <krymzen5> was samsho 64 good?
[2:45:21] <+SaltySombrero> no
[2:45:22] <BeijiWeng> Nope
[2:45:24] <DSD24> I might play Jubei he looks so cool
[2:45:26] <+TopTieramisu> it had shiki
[2:45:27] <$Mighty_observer> no
[2:45:28] <+TopTieramisu> so there's that
[2:45:28] <krymzen5> LUL Oh
[2:45:43] <%shmupdogjoe> slash his forehead! He doesn’t have much eyes to work with, you’ll probably blind him!
[2:45:45] <+ChrisAlgoo> this is making me want to watch champloo again
[2:45:52] <+solzan2000> ouch
[2:45:52] <BeijiWeng> all the other games were made by second companys
[2:45:54] <Guntanks_in_Space> SS64 is weird. I have not played much of it on emulation to say if it was good or bad though
[2:45:58] <krymzen5> glad its one of the few n64 games i don't own
[2:45:58] <+TopTieramisu> @ChrisAlgoo put Sara in samsho
[2:46:03] <$Mighty_observer> @ChrisAlgoo then you remember the ending
[2:46:05] <Guntanks_in_Space> but from what i saw on Mikado/Kouhatsu streams, it's WEEEEEEEIRD
[2:46:21] <+TopTieramisu> dude, sara from champloo would be so sick
[2:46:45] <+TopTieramisu> pelting you with rocks or using her rock cutting slashes
[2:46:50] <$Mighty_observer> I miss yoshimitsu

[2:55:24] <DSD24> @Toynota10 He has Tuberculosis
[2:55:29] <haveswordmuststing> @toynota10 Tubercolosis powers his sword
[2:55:30] <MainMan_Jonadiah> He's sick cuz he's sccaring all the doctors away with his apples
[2:55:30] <$Mighty_observer> @Toynota10 hes literally dying
[2:55:37] <DSD24> It was called Consumption back then
[2:55:39] <+CH33SEMONGER> That’s a high ass jump
[2:55:42] <@akuda_bar> the supernatural power of tuberculosis
[2:55:43] <thunderhog> Yeah, when i think of samurai, i think of punching the fuck out people
[2:55:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> i'm bleeding more, making me the victor --woolie madden
[2:55:46] <$Mighty_observer> @haveswordmuststing thats a strong power
[2:55:48] <%Toynota10> that sucks
[2:55:56] <CerberusDriver> if i get TB, ill become a samurai
[2:56:04] <%Solidnick18> oof
[2:56:07] <%Toynota10> he could be coughing into elbow tho. he's gonna get germs all over his sword
[2:56:07] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:56:08] <+Spider1991> bloody dreads
[2:56:14] <$Mighty_observer> @CaptainPileDriver how do you like my nuts to your fist style?
[2:56:16] <lordreginald> @WoolieVersus you can also TK that air move, super nasty after a 2K. also you can also do his aerial special out of backdash
[2:56:23] <+SaltySombrero> good shit
[2:56:26] <krymzen5> i'll put money tht the power of love and friendship is keeping him alive
[2:56:29] <namornow> lol
[2:56:31] <President_valentine> that move is godlike
[2:56:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> but master, i wanted to be the chosen one
[2:56:40] <+solzan2000> thats a fast overhead
[2:56:46] <rufus2k2> man no followup to that kick? shame
[2:56:49] <%CaptainPileDriver> YOU go this way, I'LL go home
[2:56:50] <experimilk> less go
[2:56:50] <DSD24> Man this alt color makes him look like Kojorou Sasaki
[2:56:59] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Hammer in the corner seems scary
[2:57:03] <$Mighty_observer> @CaptainPileDriver we trained him wrong, as a joke
[2:57:05] <+TopTieramisu> sasaki kojiro is ukyo's inspiration
[2:57:09] <+EightFootOctopus> is this match taking place on hammer mountain
[2:57:10] <fireking900> Yo Woolie where the drill at tho?
[2:57:16] <+TopTieramisu> just like haohmaru's is miyamoto musashi
[2:57:25] <%fFailureatlife> Strike a pose
[2:57:31] <haveswordmuststing> @fireking900 last round of the last match of the set
[2:57:33] <%CaptainPileDriver> WE'RE CHILDREN WE'RE CHILDREN
[2:57:34] <+SaltySombrero> use darli's command grab
[2:57:49] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Never jump
[2:57:59] <+TopTieramisu> baited
[2:58:03] <pavramz> @TopTieramisu wait isnt jubei also musashi?
[2:58:10] <$Mighty_observer> now i could either dodge the iron claw, or take it in the face and roll around dying
[2:58:15] <DSD24> I hope Ukyo does a Swallow Reversal
[2:58:19] <rufus2k2> Darli's design gives me echoes of Ayla from Chrono Trigger for some reason..
[2:58:20] <+TopTieramisu> @pavramz i definitely know haohmaru is musashi
[2:58:22] <+SaltySombrero> Issen is a good anti-air btw
[2:58:32] <GoldeNOVA> Iaijutsu is super cool but there's something about Ukyo that I don't quite like
[2:58:33] <+TopTieramisu> jubei doesn't really come across like musashi
[2:58:33] <Triplicat> TSUBAME GAESHI
[2:58:36] <rufus2k2> that zero frame
[2:58:38] <+linkwolf4> lytGULP
[2:58:38] <+Spider1991> nice
[2:58:40] <$Mighty_observer> @rufus2k2 dats... racist?
[2:58:40] <pavramz> hmmmm
[2:58:43] <President_valentine> is so dirty
[2:58:44] <EnviTheFool> Yagyu Jubei is probably just inspired by himself since he's a real guy
[2:58:53] <DSD24> Lets Go Lets Go
[2:58:57] <%Solidnick18> this game is H O T
[2:58:59] <pavramz> ok
[2:59:02] <Triplicat> there is no grounded tsubame is there
[2:59:07] <+solzan2000> thats the most lethal overhead
[2:59:07] <CerberusDriver> Hows the netcode for this game gonna be
[2:59:08] <@akuda_bar> did ukyo just stash a snack in his kimono
[2:59:11] <Triplicat> you have to either TK it or backdash?
[2:59:12] <BackwardCap> They got the game? How do I get the game?
[2:59:13] <$Mighty_observer> @Solidnick18 like ice cream
[2:59:18] <DSD24> @akuda_bar Yeah his apples
[2:59:21] <CerberusDriver> I hope the netcode will be good
[2:59:22] <+SaltySombrero> tsubame gaeshi is air only
[2:59:27] <%Solidnick18> Melting bars yee
[2:59:27] <President_valentine> you can backdash and do it
[2:59:29] <+TopTieramisu> @BackwardCap become a twitch influencer OpieOP
[2:59:31] <@akuda_bar> do the apples keep the doctor away
[2:59:43] <MainMan_Jonadiah> @BackwardCap You wait a week, like the rest of us savages
[2:59:52] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 3 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 12oz (360mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[2:59:55] <rufus2k2> @CerberusDriver them tackling the input lag so early and so viciously gives me hope
[3:00:00] <$Mighty_observer> @akuda_bar apperently not, but it gives you cool practice
[3:00:03] <LiquidBinge> do a shot of water
[3:00:06] <haveswordmuststing> @akuda_bar yes, thats why he has tubercolosis for 20 years
[3:00:09] <CerberusDriver> hopefully its like MK 11 netcode.
[3:00:15] <experimilk> i think it's been patched
[3:00:18] <fireking900> Woolie vs Woolie in a Fem Woolie mirror
[3:00:22] <President_valentine> Do the super
[3:00:23] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Ukyo looks pretty nice
[3:00:24] <experimilk> don't get your hopes up for mk11 netcode
[3:00:25] <BackwardCap> Hmm, how do I become an influencer in less than a week OWLWinston
[3:00:32] <Triplicat> LOL this guy
[3:00:32] <experimilk> it took years and a devoted AAA team to do mk11 netcode
[3:00:35] <thunderhog> Woolie with the street fighter 4 instincts
[3:00:48] <$Mighty_observer> Darli vs Tam is the TRUE Woolie vs Woolie
[3:00:50] <eldragon_1> Raw super
[3:00:51] <Triplicat> "but if I punish with H I can't cancel out of it" even though raw H is like 30%
[3:00:55] <+Rabbitmage> Ukyo got the aids
[3:01:00] <+linkwolf4> I can already see it: Darli mirror, Gentleman's agreement to put down weapons and PUNCH IT OUT.
[3:01:19] <rufus2k2> those weapon block sounds are clean
[3:01:27] <%Solidnick18> WOOLIE
[3:01:32] <%Solidnick18> Oh

[3:05:46] <%mistersups> woolieREGGIEFUL woolieREGGIEFUL woolieREGGIEFUL
[3:05:56] <DSD24> Linne would be cool in SamSho

[3:06:12] <BoogieDeluxe> the B in B Tatsu stands for Beutral
[3:06:17] <$Mighty_observer> can the living zombie beat the fencer girl? no
[3:06:18] <GoldeNOVA> Namco needs to give SNK a call, do Soul Cal x SamSho

[3:06:38] <DSD24> @GoldeNOVA Nightmare in Samsho would be rad
[3:06:48] <leontaich> As someone new to the series, is it super footsies based?
[3:06:48] <%mistersups> Imagine if the next SoulCal guest character is a SamSho character
[3:06:54] <+TopTieramisu> with arcsys take on the painterly style in this samsho
[3:06:55] <experimilk> what's footsies
[3:07:02] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Samu got nooch!
[3:07:03] <@akuda_bar> work the nooch
[3:07:03] <haveswordmuststing> @toptieramisu thats like putting Mahvel with Yie Ar Kung Fu
[3:07:05] <BoogieDeluxe> I'm new to Samsho, but it seems VERY footsies based, yeah
[3:07:07] <WackyModder84> Somebody give Ukyo a fucking Claratin!
[3:07:11] <experimilk> it's focused on netural, but your SF footsies don't work
[3:07:25] <experimilk> so it can be an entrapping term if you come in with certain assumptions
[3:07:25] <%Toynota10> do these people have magic powers
[3:07:27] <haveswordmuststing> nono, wait, Karate Champ
[3:07:29] <Saltmeisterr> this game is all about that NOOCH
[3:07:38] <$Mighty_observer> you know who we need in sam sho, FUMA KOTARO
[3:07:42] <pollosucio_> i really do want corvo in a fighting game
[3:07:43] <+TopTieramisu> @haveswordmuststing mahvel itself has sf characters in it that work. it can pan out
[3:07:50] <krymzen5> i think SF footsies transfer over best tbh
[3:07:54] <DSD24> @pollosucio_ Corvo from Dishonored?
[3:07:56] <experimilk> ehh
[3:07:57] <pollosucio_> ye
[3:08:02] <experimilk> you're really setting yourself up for disappointment
[3:08:07] <experimilk> if you expect SF footsies to work here
[3:08:07] <rufus2k2> dat Raphael stabby
[3:08:08] <+linkwolf4> @WackyModder84 claratin don't fix Tuberculosis.
[3:08:08] <$Mighty_observer> FUFUFU

[3:08:19] <+RoboBro1212> Charlotte x Iori OTP
[3:08:19] <Saltmeisterr> corvo is a weird pick
[3:08:24] <haveswordmuststing> lets all agree to limit tech to bloodborne and below
[3:08:24] <%Toynota10> ohhhhhhh hohohoho

[3:09:00] <+RoboBro1212> I love the Breakers Revenge version, Pielle LUL

[3:09:07] <+linkwolf4> oh we talkin FATE??? zyzxNSmug
[3:09:13] <rufus2k2> LOL
[3:09:14] <experimilk> it's easy to start playing without advance knowledge and enjoy hitting buttons
[3:09:17] <%arcturusblade> How did they get this game early?
[3:09:18] <rufus2k2> Saber pls go
[3:09:21] <leontaich> Feels easier to get into than Tekken that's for sure haha
[3:09:32] <%arcturusblade> Ah neat

[3:10:50] <rufus2k2> good color combo
[3:11:05] <gustavozxd> this is a cool stage

[3:11:10] <Triplicat> the once a match ultras are 641236C+D though
[3:11:21] <%Toynota10> ps4 will leave lots of players, but if you don't care about that, it'll look and run best on PC no question

[3:12:14] <+TopTieramisu> 2020?
[3:12:16] <Triplicat> winter??
[3:12:16] <$Mighty_observer> Grind those Rathian parts
[3:12:23] <+EightFootOctopus> You have to think of heavy like a special move, they do that much or more damage
[3:12:24] <experimilk> still supposed to be 2019
[3:12:29] <experimilk> late 2019
[3:12:31] <+TopTieramisu> ok
[3:12:32] <Quikanims> Darli's damage is ass
[3:12:37] <+SovereignMan> Darli kinda sucks. They did my man gen an wrong cutting him
[3:12:49] <haveswordmuststing> @quikanims just Galactica Phantom once Kappa
[3:12:50] <Omgbasedjay> @quikanims she actually deals a fuck ton
[3:12:52] <$Mighty_observer> @Quikanims shes a meme charecter
[3:13:01] <experimilk> she deals a lot of damage but she's slow
[3:13:01] <Lamedhos> Does this have the input lag fix or is that not released till day 1
[3:13:15] <experimilk> i think they've already pushed out the lag patch
[3:13:17] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Really guys? Making day -7 tier lists?
[3:13:25] <+jbaker009> oh wow is this the woolie's Brain system?
[3:13:28] <Diam0nd_Dawg278> My baby Darli got her saxy Amazonian pirate ass evo17Rekt NotLikeThis tsbFeels
[3:13:35] <Quikanims> her jabs and dp do very little for how slow they are
[3:13:35] <$Mighty_observer> @Quikanims like Necalli
[3:13:35] <+TopTieramisu> has jwong made a tierlist yet for samsho?
[3:13:43] <bear_breaker20> its a good day when review copies for a fighting game actually reaches someone who knows how to play
[3:13:47] <krymzen5> yeah, gotta love the internet @MainMan_Jonadiah shit drives me crazy
[3:13:54] <+EightFootOctopus> Darli does good damage wool just isn't getting the chance
[3:13:56] <%woh86> woh86 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[3:14:03] <rufus2k2> there must be a followup for that kick...

[3:14:27] <+jbaker009> yo when's hyper DBZ?
[3:14:28] <DSD24> I love day 0 tier lists
[3:14:29] <haveswordmuststing> calebTHROW
[3:14:29] <experimilk> i'm waiting for my review copy ;_;
[3:14:44] <gustavozxd> just one more level up and you got enough IQ
[3:14:59] <+TopTieramisu> @jbaker009 you mean DBFZ Super?
[3:15:00] <$Mighty_observer> @jbaker009 you mean Dragon ball fighters?
[3:15:17] <MainMan_Jonadiah> "I'm watching other people play day 1 versions of these characters, I think I can make a pretty solid educated guess on how viable this character is."
[3:15:18] <gustavozxd> that was good
[3:15:22] <BeNiceOrGetOutt> does the game have a tutorial mode?
[3:15:25] <$Mighty_observer> just use cell, 16, and goku
[3:15:26] <DSD24> I want Woolie to work at it
[3:15:31] <+jbaker009> nope I'm.talking hyper DBZ lol the jank hype Mugen game
[3:15:34] <pollosucio_> did they play shiki yet?
[3:15:41] <+TopTieramisu> this is a nice color palette for darli as well
[3:15:43] <DSD24> @pollosucio_ Yes they did
[3:15:46] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Shiki's shown up like once or twice
[3:15:48] <pollosucio_> ooo nice
[3:15:51] <$Mighty_observer> @jbaker009 probably canceled
[3:15:56] <krymzen5> "even tho patches may drop day 1 changing the meta"
[3:16:03] <MainMan_Jonadiah> I think Reggie said he's gunna play her again next time he's up.
[3:16:06] <WackyModder84> @Mighty_observer Except it isn't. Hyper DBZ is still going strong.
[3:16:12] <rufus2k2> "you have the eye of an artisan, undaunted by anyone. Heh it was an honor to fight you" SeemsGood
[3:16:26] <SuperFightinRobot> What system would you guys suggest getting this for?
[3:16:35] <+solzan2000> ps4
[3:16:36] <$Mighty_observer> @WackyModder84 how? the last time i heard about it was when the superbestfriends played it
[3:16:37] <+TopTieramisu> i'm waiting for PC
[3:16:47] <krymzen5> i'd say ps4. it'll probs be the most active
[3:16:50] <+TopTieramisu> though it'll suck
[3:16:53] <+TopTieramisu> waiting
[3:17:04] <WackyModder84> @Mighty_observer then clearly you haven't been paying attention, they just released a new character a couple of months ago, and got MULTIPLE OTHERS on the way. lol
[3:17:05] <+EightFootOctopus> hyper dbz is getting a 5.0 patch soon
[3:17:11] <+jbaker009> yeah they played it back in the super best days but I think it would be fun for them to look at now with a more fighting game mind
[3:17:18] <+HimeHimeMusic> is it me or the fighting in this game slow
[3:17:18] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:17:20] <Quikanims> I'm still not convinced about Darli's damage, nothing seems to justify how slow and how much recovery her moves have
[3:17:20] <$Mighty_observer> @TopTieramisu just but the game twice Kappa
[3:17:22] <+jbaker009> the game is buated
[3:17:28] <+jbaker009> busted
[3:17:29] <haveswordmuststing> @himehimemusic yes, thats the point
[3:17:31] <%gatorafan> For fighting games this gen is PS4. But if you want SNK to sell ONE MILLION copies also get it on PC later Kappa
[3:17:40] <+solzan2000> lol
[3:17:46] <thunderhog> YEEEEEEEEAH
[3:17:46] <+TopTieramisu> purple stuff
[3:17:47] <rufus2k2> grog's up!
[3:17:49] <$Mighty_observer> @WackyModder84 i hope it actually drops and doesnt get C&D
[3:17:51] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Chug! Chug! Chug!

[3:18:03] <zeif00> Darli is so cool
[3:18:04] <SolGoodguy> are woolie bait
[3:18:05] <WackyModder84> @Mighty_observer Bruh. It physically CAN'T get a C&D. It's just MUGEN. lol
[3:18:07] <+linkwolf4> @HimeHimeMusic it's slow, but everything hits like a truck
[3:18:09] <Triplicat> ONE AND DONE
[3:18:10] <gustavozxd> I've never seen that pose
[3:18:10] <+chefhasteeth> SamSho is also gonna be on Stadia if you want to have extra latency chwLaugh @TopTieramisu
[3:18:11] <+solzan2000> lmao

[3:18:14] <切捨御免> ouch
[3:18:17] <%fFailureatlife> bruh pls
[3:18:21] <+jbaker009> this game looks dope.tho
[3:18:24] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Can't tell if that was a typo or shade
[3:18:24] <rufus2k2> y'all got JOKES
[3:18:25] <+linkwolf4> lytFILTH
[3:18:26] <Havik0666> cool stuff
[3:18:28] <ECRead> doodStare doodStare doodStare
[3:18:29] <krymzen5> looking at the game at 720 making calls LUL
[3:18:30] <BeijiWeng> I mean it looks like the ps2 version Kappa
[3:18:31] <Omgbasedjay> Meme gai
[3:18:31] <suspence15> My boy GALFORD
[3:18:33] <TigerClaws12> shoot him
[3:18:35] <Guntanks_in_Space> PS2 graphics gags are so last season lol
[3:18:37] <%Blazymaniac> Blazymaniac subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[3:18:38] <%mistersups> woolieF woolieU
[3:18:38] <+jbaker009> I love footsie games
[3:18:40] <+jetjagger222> doggo time
[3:18:42] <Nineball_Luce> Oh ok, must be the PSP version. gotcha
[3:18:44] <gustavozxd> could be a typo LUL
[3:18:44] <Diam0nd_Dawg278> She got Captain Morgan in that barrel BrokeBack
[3:18:45] <haveswordmuststing> calebY why are we playing a ps2 game
[3:18:50] <Triplicat> this is samurai shodown 64
[3:18:53] <$Mighty_observer> @WackyModder84 never say never, it can totally get hit with some copyrigth bullshit
[3:18:53] <Havik0666> can you just play poppy like in the previous sam sho?
[3:18:57] <+EightFootOctopus> samsho V has the ps2 thumbnail that's why lol
[3:19:00] <President_valentine> nope
[3:19:03] <+CrackedPipe457> This looks good, probably pick it up now
[3:19:09] <切捨御免> if your captain morgan is purple something has gone horribly wrong
[3:19:11] <+jbaker009> this is clearly for the Virtual boy
[3:19:17] <%mistersups> woolieFABRICATION woolieFABRICATION woolieFABRICATION
[3:19:23] <+TopTieramisu> @chefhasteeth dope. my yomi will be godlike once i get used to that version since i'll be playing the whole round before i see it LUL
[3:19:32] <%shmupdogjoe> Well, grog is not the same thing as rum
[3:19:33] <$Mighty_observer> white people in japan? RUN JAPANES PEOPLE, DONT END UP LIKE AFRICA!
[3:19:33] <WackyModder84> @Mighty_observer No, you don't get it dude. MUGEN is in a legally gray zone. By that logic, they would have to C&D Tens of Thousands of DBZ Fan Characters / Fighting Games on the MUGEN Engine. Which is impossible and impractical too.
[3:19:36] <Guntanks_in_Space> on that tangent, sen was so fucking jank
[3:19:39] <%shmupdogjoe> I don't know what colour grog is supposed to be though
[3:19:40] <krymzen5> This is actually a Jaguar game Kappa
[3:19:43] <Guntanks_in_Space> a bit enjoyable to an extent
[3:19:43] <suspence15> Les dosis, puupy!
[3:19:48] <thunderhog> Wait, what fighter actually yells out he's doing an overhead?
[3:19:53] <+jetjagger222> for matching service
[3:19:54] <GoldeNOVA> Is this SamSho for the Stadia?
[3:19:58] <gustavozxd> for the Soulja Boy 64
[3:20:00] <thunderhog> Galford, literally the worst ninja
[3:20:05] <%shmupdogjoe> Only the raddest fighters, @thunderhog
[3:20:09] <%shmupdogjoe> it shows confidence
[3:20:13] <$Mighty_observer> @WackyModder84 oooook, hopefully
[3:20:19] <President_valentine> Galford is a weeb what do you expect
[3:20:19] <%gatorafan> @goldenova isn't it coming to the Stadia?
[3:20:20] <+EightFootOctopus> medium poppy should lead to a free hit
[3:20:22] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Now, if he yelled Overhead while doing a low... That's next level
[3:20:42] <thunderhog> the loudest of mind games
[3:20:42] <+linkwolf4> call out the overhead, to get in their head.
[3:20:42] <%shmupdogjoe> that's straight up cheating
[3:20:44] <zentav> SamSho will be on stadia for some reason
[3:20:49] <thunderhog> yelling out every move only to do something else
[3:20:50] <%mistersups> Ohohohoho
[3:20:51] <+TopTieramisu> they need a character with feints that yells feint when he uses them
[3:20:52] <%fFailureatlife> charlotte op pls nerf
[3:20:52] <+linkwolf4> make him second guess.
[3:20:54] <Diam0nd_Dawg278> I'm so glad I already paid for my pre-order! majinoBaleyjay Still gotta wait a week. NotLikeThis tsbFeels
[3:21:08] <ECRead> doodCrazy PUPPY! doodBenny3
[3:21:17] <rufus2k2> do machine gun dog!
[3:21:25] <haveswordmuststing> a character that only has voice lines of false frame data
[3:21:27] <+jbaker009> now I gotta decide if I get this 1st or punch planet
[3:21:44] <%shmupdogjoe> When he screams "plus on block!" that means it's actually your turn
[3:21:55] <DSD24> Oh is Punch Planet coming out soon?
[3:22:27] <haveswordmuststing> Gascoigne
[3:22:47] <+jbaker009> it's on steam
[3:22:52] <%shmupdogjoe> Gask-wang
[3:22:56] <Quikanims> guys help I don't speak crossiant
[3:22:59] <$Mighty_observer> if a real frenchman heard you speaking canadian french, he would slap you all with a silk white glove
[3:23:01] <+TopTieramisu> a character that yells out literally every input his player presses
[3:23:04] <+EightFootOctopus> old galford trick: whiff kick then do command grab. Works with Hanzo, too lol
[3:23:15] <+TopTieramisu> rightleftdownACleft
[3:23:18] <gustavozxd> oh the throw is really slow huh
[3:23:20] <haveswordmuststing> @mighty_observer you mean a silk white flag calebY
[3:23:36] <eldragon_1> Ohohohoho
[3:23:39] <$Mighty_observer> @haveswordmuststing same thing in emergencies
[3:23:41] <Triplicat> throw is normal speed, throw WHIFF is a billion years
[3:23:42] <%shmupdogjoe> Top Tieramisu, that would be amazing, I'd start doing 1414141414 constantly on defense just to be annoying
[3:23:44] <rufus2k2> poppy with that rekka
[3:23:56] <+boosh5> si papi
[3:23:59] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Would the voice lines cancel each other out, or would they overlap? @TopTieramisu
[3:24:02] <thunderhog> damn that wiff doh
[3:24:06] <haveswordmuststing> i thought tighty whighties were for emergancy surrenders
[3:24:06] <+TopTieramisu> @MainMan_Jonadiah yes
[3:24:12] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Perfect
[3:24:14] <Triplicat> enough to punish with raw heavy
[3:24:28] <rufus2k2> destroyed~
[3:24:29] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:25:21] <切捨御免> D: PETA
[3:25:29] <$Mighty_observer> can we get a DMX skin for Galford?
[3:25:33] <%shmupdogjoe> Everybody wants to be Poppy! Poppy!...
[3:25:47] <rufus2k2> YO THAT KICK
[3:25:52] <+EightFootOctopus> there you go
[3:26:04] <rufus2k2> that was some capoeira shit, where'd she learn that?
[3:26:05] <%shmupdogjoe> I feel like a dog is an unfair advantage in a duel
[3:26:12] <JanusII> Cutting someone clean in half with a fencing sabre though. LUL
[3:26:20] <Papafleish> nothing screams samurai fighting game like two white blonds
[3:26:24] <haveswordmuststing> @rufus2k2 ballet?
[3:26:32] <$Mighty_observer> i feel like lightning powers are unfaie also
[3:26:39] <rufus2k2> @haveswordmuststing I'll believe it
[3:26:49] <+TopTieramisu> @Papafleish have you played last blade? Kappa
[3:26:55] <$Mighty_observer> @Papafleish just the way japan wanted it
[3:27:01] <+EightFootOctopus> don't jump after the enemy activates lol, that's free -80%
[3:27:05] <krymzen5> japans vision
[3:27:08] <+TopTieramisu> the black haired protagonist literally goes super saiyan
[3:27:08] <%shmupdogjoe> Well, if you play it back in slow motion she doesn't really cut you in half with the sabre, she actually more *lathes* you in half. It's pretty horrific
[3:27:33] <CalvinSimsArt> heavy is too slow after a throw
[3:27:37] <Owkono> Gilgamesh would be fun
[3:27:42] <Guntanks_in_Space> ah, last blade. where the protag turns super saiyan and the naginata wielder is blonde
[3:27:44] <Diam0nd_Dawg278> SoonerLater Who let the dog out? OhMyDog
[3:27:49] <+EightFootOctopus> try B into special after throw then
[3:27:51] <haveswordmuststing> we could use more Yoshitora
[3:27:52] <Quikanims> YEAH OKAY THERE SONICFOX
[3:28:00] <Papafleish> I want the first guest char to be Terminator
[3:28:02] <+jetjagger222> whens earfquake
[3:28:03] <krymzen5> i would still freak out over a last blade rep
[3:28:04] <Quikanims> SIDE SWITCHIN'
[3:28:14] <$Mighty_observer> @Guntanks_in_Space JUST THE WAY JAPAN...
[3:28:29] <+jetjagger222> ANIME
[3:28:35] <Guntanks_in_Space> i think someone who can land a special off throw is genjuro
[3:28:35] <lefthook11> Let’s hope it raises the fighting games standards from now on !
[3:28:41] <Guntanks_in_Space> like guard break, crouch A into A Rekka
[3:28:44] <%CaptainPileDriver> hE cHeAtEd

[3:28:49] <%CaptainPileDriver> says the scrub
[3:29:02] <kDemented> yea yea Yoshi !!
[3:29:03] <DSD24> Man that neutral pose is cool on Yoshitora

[3:41:09] <+EightFootOctopus> you get your super duper once per match
[3:41:14] <+pooglywoogly> Super Special Move is one time per match. Can't use it in another round.
[3:41:23] <$Mighty_observer> @TopTieramisu well it was shiki vs Tam Tam, and lets just say... Tam hungry
[3:41:35] <+pooglywoogly> Weapon Flipping Tehcnique is the one that's repeatable as long as you have full rage meter.

[3:43:31] <Guntanks_in_Space> i wanna learn wu, but my heart calls for Genjuro, Ukyo or Yoshitora (my old stand-bys)
[3:43:32] <President_valentine> It's either Ukyo or Jubei for me
[3:43:45] <$Mighty_observer> jubei is sword guile
[3:43:50] <President_valentine> mayber Shiki
[3:43:51] <+EightFootOctopus> everyone but nak looks fun to me lol
[3:44:06] <MainMan_Jonadiah> I want to play every character except like 2 (Charlotte and Rux)
[3:44:14] <+TopTieramisu> @EightFootOctopus even rimururu? Kappa
[3:44:20] <Triplicat> just 5H
[3:44:23] <+EightFootOctopus> yeah
[3:44:34] <$Mighty_observer> ......
[3:44:46] <+EightFootOctopus> Irohas will be catching these hands though, they're on sight
[3:44:49] <Admiral_PopnFresh> So we are looking at combos of like 3 or 4 individual inputs max, huh?
[3:45:05] <$SilverRoddo> Do any streamers have cameras mounted on their controllers? Like the way guitar players have cams on the head of their instruments?
[3:45:06] <Triplicat> who in the game has a DP that can't be punished by 5H on whiff
[3:45:21] <$SilverRoddo> I feel that would be a good gimmick.
[3:45:24] <Triplicat> that would surprise me extremely
[3:45:27] <%shmupdogjoe> I don't think that's a thing in this game
[3:45:40] <lordreginald> 1 or 2 with the exception of the occasional rekka

[3:46:09] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Opening with heavies looks so nice!
[3:46:19] <Guntanks_in_Space> some people do that for music games @SilverRoddo , and some retro players have input display overlays i think
[3:46:30] <brokenroberto> is the dodge/side step mechanic even worth it? @woolieversus
[3:46:33] <Guntanks_in_Space> or the DMC CMV dudes who have inputs show up on their webcam
[3:46:56] <$Mighty_observer> its a yomi
[3:47:03] <$SilverRoddo> Nice, i’ll have to look out for them, thank you.
[3:47:07] <haveswordmuststing> character stops existing for a short window
[3:47:23] <+Spider1991> I believe that it even avoids issen if timed correctly
[3:47:23] <MeiraF> How do you cut up people after the round?
[3:47:29] <+boosh5> Does it have the old clash and mash?
[3:47:32] <Guntanks_in_Space> yea @Spider1991 i think it does
[3:47:37] <Guntanks_in_Space> @boosh5 yeah clash mash is there
[3:47:42] <+boosh5> nice
[3:47:43] <$Mighty_observer> unarmed jubei runs like a anime
[3:47:49] <haveswordmuststing> @boosh5 and it actually works
[3:47:51] <+EightFootOctopus> sometimes try dashing under them too for anti air
[3:47:53] <brokenroberto> ok, I haven't seen it used well yet. :)
[3:48:10] <+ameer000> Does this game feel similar to that granblue fighting game in terms of neutral?

[3:53:39] <haveswordmuststing> @dsd24 well, theres the one 1000 year old but not much
[3:53:39] <$Mighty_observer> is this stage Granada?
[3:53:57] <+supaXmugen> Kenshin is pretty great until after the Shishio Arc. then it just kinda has nowhere to go. especially since they didnt use the final arc of the manga

[3:55:32] <%CaptainPileDriver> JUST START THE ROUND WITH IT
[3:55:34] <%jinking79> So Woolie won that match
[3:55:45] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Woolie's in his head now
[3:55:46] <Triplicat> he can't, she needs to put the sword down first
[3:55:53] <+supaXmugen> That Crossup is fucking dumb
[3:55:55] <+supaXmugen> just sayin
[3:56:10] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Not gonna lie, Darli is Hype as fuck

[3:56:46] <$Mighty_observer> @TopTieramisu kof Iori?
[3:56:49] <+TopTieramisu> yeah
[3:56:50] <Diam0nd_Dawg278> @Mighty_observer Yeah. Hattori Hanzo was a real life ninja. Japanese made many shows and movies about him.
[3:57:00] <MainMan_Jonadiah> He played a match against Reggie earlier where he tried to land it the ENTIRE round
[3:57:10] <+TopTieramisu> iori's stanky leg that also can give him a super backdash
[3:57:13] <Admiral_PopnFresh> It is kinda like the Haitian revolt of 1804
[3:57:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> start the round off with galatica phantom
[3:57:26] <+supaXmugen> eeeeww
[3:57:30] <+supaXmugen> the minus frames
[3:57:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> i'm gonna keep giving bad advice
[3:57:43] <$Mighty_observer> @Diam0nd_Dawg278 i know, but i only se him in like every video game ever, not any movies or shows
[3:57:43] <President_valentine> try it with a back throw
[3:57:45] <$SilverRoddo> Darlingtonette?

[3:58:09] <%shmupdogjoe> DOOOO IT
[3:58:20] <%shmupdogjoe> SWORD DOWN AND PUNCH... aw, the moment is past
[3:58:23] <+supaXmugen> wut?
[3:58:33] <rufus2k2> what was that!
[3:58:33] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Was that a command grab?
[3:58:34] <+TopTieramisu> yo, she's got the dragunov slide
[3:58:41] <%CaptainPileDriver> START IT OFF WITH GALATICA PHANTOM DAMNIT
[3:58:47] <Admiral_PopnFresh> PJsalt
[3:58:48] <+supaXmugen> I think the one thing people arent going to like about this is how COMMITTED you have to be to every action.
[3:58:50] <%mistersups> Thank the people?
[3:58:54] <MainMan_Jonadiah> That look Jimmy gave
[3:58:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> no you don't

[3:59:41] <%mistersups> She pretty much is a One Piece character.
[3:59:47] <%mistersups> She'd fit right in
[3:59:49] <DSD24> Yo Blue Haohmaru is rad as fuck
[3:59:53] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 4 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 16oz (480mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.

[4:00:22] <President_valentine> Unlike one piece Darli has a good design
[4:00:26] <MainMan_Jonadiah> If Darli's waist was like half the size it is now, she'd be a One Piece character

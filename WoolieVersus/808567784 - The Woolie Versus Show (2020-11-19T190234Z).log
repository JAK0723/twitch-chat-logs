[0:09:15] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:09:40] <%skyheys> Boo on Aegis Rim! it's not realistic like CoD! anime and time travel arent real!

[0:10:00] <%ion900> I've been watching so many let's plays of 13S, who wants to remind me what they've seen?
[0:10:13] <%ion900> Without spoiling everyone else obvs
[0:10:15] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[0:10:15] <%MyNameIsRasus> @skyheys both space and robots are present in this video game tho
[0:10:29] <SenorDose> Crossing my fingers he gets too Shu's story. I lost my fucking mind when THAT happened
[0:10:37] <+cvp5127> congrats on aegis for being nominated for best narrative
[0:10:39] <%skyheys> @mynameisrasus woolieFABRICATION Are they?
[0:10:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I haven't heard this theme in forever
[0:10:47] <%skyheys> who can say for certain?

[0:11:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THIS SING IS SO NIER
[0:11:08] <+Sp3ctre48> They didn't nominate it for best art direction though which is kinda baffling
[0:11:22] <%MyNameIsRasus> plot twist none of 13s was real you're actually overdosing on crack cocaine in your buddy jared's bathroom
[0:11:25] <%skyheys> @sp3ctre48 TGA is a sham and always has been
[0:11:26] <+cvp5127> @Sp3ctre48 im just glad it got noticed at all
[0:11:37] <+Sp3ctre48> yeah, any exposure is good
[0:11:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @mynameisrasus Wait.....ALL OF US?
[0:11:52] <%ion900> TLOU2 will win best narrative though
[0:11:54] <%ion900> it is fated
[0:11:59] <%MyNameIsRasus> @BallerSwagBro9k it's a big fucking bathroom ok
[0:12:09] <sullivansbizarreadventure> @ion900 It’s also rigged.
[0:12:17] <%ion900> basically what I meant lol
[0:12:21] <+cvp5127> yea its a popularity contest
[0:12:34] <SenorDose> This year was a bit of slim pickings in general imo
[0:12:37] <Althallos> TLOU2 is gonna pull a RDR2 and win in nominations it has no place winning
[0:12:43] <%MyNameIsRasus> if yak7 doesn't get best rpgs imma get me mallet
[0:12:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> RUN WOOLIE RUN from the Hunter obsessed Irish Man
[0:12:57] <Garry_Guyface> They need to expand to indie games already
[0:13:00] <Althallos> Octopath got robbed in the best soundtrack nomination
[0:13:02] <%ion900> don't you dare question it though, or Troy Baker will come after you on twitter
[0:13:13] <SenorDose> xenoblade chronicles remastered got fucking robbed
[0:13:14] <sullivansbizarreadventure> @mynameisrasus That’s a weird way to spell P5R...

[0:22:04] <%skyheys> Geoff has decided Vturbers are NOT relevant
[0:22:21] <%Seancicle> anyway
[0:22:23] <%gatorafan> I haven't watched a single Vtuber stuff daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:22:26] <%Irridium> based Geoff
[0:22:29] <+b_aleph> @BallerSwagBro9k just get a black brogue and get the toes painted silver
[0:22:37] <@akuda_bar> this conversation is aggressively relatable
[0:22:40] <SenorDose> cringe take geoff
[0:23:07] <+jiggy_snipe> would you refund an mp3?
[0:23:14] <%MyNameIsRasus> WOULD YOU DOWNLOAD A CAR
[0:23:22] <%Jack8274> YES
[0:23:24] <%skyheys> not if the tutorial is 5 hours
[0:23:24] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1328635387057758213?s=19
[0:23:26] <%MyNameIsRasus> ME TOO
[0:23:28] <%BallerSwagBro9k> 2 hours isn't enough to know tho
[0:23:31] <+cvp5127> cant you refund a license?
[0:23:32] <+Harro8> Because they can resell your physical copy
[0:23:32] <%gatorafan> I would download RAM if I could daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:23:51] <%Irridium> remember when Skyrim PS3 completely shit its ass after like 80 hours and became legit unplayable
[0:23:54] <+jiggy_snipe> 2 hours probably isn't enough tbf especially when you account for computer issues
[0:23:55] <+Harro8> They don't gain anything from letting you refund your digital
[0:24:01] <SenorDose> I would star trek replicator everything if i could
[0:24:02] <%skyheys> some games are made way too long just to cockblock that shit
[0:24:06] <CappuccinoGuil> The difference is Refunds come out of the dev's pocket, chat
[0:24:08] <+Standard_Enemy> Game genres are so varied too. Like 2 hours in a fighting game is way different from 2 hours in a long rpg
[0:24:08] <+Harro8> Ohh
[0:24:36] <%MyNameIsRasus> In the first hours of P5 you haven't even got to the Palace yet
[0:24:55] <%gatorafan> I missed my chance to refund Age of Empires III DE because I spent like 3 hours building decks before even playing the game daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:24:59] <@akuda_bar> you ate the burger
[0:24:59] <$RyTYoung> You can't return a half drunken can of coke
[0:25:02] <%gatorafan> I deserve it daedra1CryingTibs
[0:25:03] <%skyheys> that's fair, which is why 2 hours is a bad call. some games are 90 minutes
[0:25:09] <CappuccinoGuil> If you go to Gamestop and get credit, the developer doesn't lose money, and too many players refund indies that are 2 hours long
[0:25:10] <%skyheys> some are 500 hours
[0:25:12] <@akuda_bar> you complained there was a hair in your burger but you ate the burger
[0:25:15] <+Harro8> makes sense. Can't return a meal i ate
[0:25:15] <+jiggy_snipe> well you can't refund physical stuff once it's open except for a couple stores
[0:25:27] <%Seancicle> maybe
[0:25:38] <%Seancicle> woolieCHAN
[0:25:39] <+Standard_Enemy> I feel like allowing the devs to choose a refund timeframe is a good compromise.
[0:25:49] <%skyheys> 2 hours seriously isnt enough for games like P5 and Coldsteel
[0:25:57] <Althallos> Dragon Quest 11 demo on Switch being 10 hours was such a good deal
[0:26:04] <+ramenpoweredemo> frfr
[0:26:11] <%skyheys> You dont even get to play the damn game on those two
[0:26:11] <SenorDose> 2 hours sounds enough to know if you'll be invested or not
[0:26:12] <+jiggy_snipe> yea dev/pub determined refund period would be a good compromise
[0:26:13] <jorniev> TIME FOR YAKISOBA PAN
[0:26:18] <%MyNameIsRasus> @Standard_Enemy as long as steam sets a minimum tho, because that could get abused really bad
[0:26:25] <pixel_river> atleast you support a dev you may like
[0:26:37] <%Terrarp> 2 hrs should be enough to refund no questions asked
[0:26:44] <+Standard_Enemy> Oh for sure @MyNameIsRasus lol watch people be like "5 minutes or no refund"
[0:26:53] <+jiggy_snipe> buying a tv for the super bowl Kappa and returning it after
[0:26:53] <%Terrarp> more than 2 it needs some eyes
[0:27:05] <CappuccinoGuil> I would love to see the refund chart on AAA vs Indie games, how many people those?
[0:27:20] <SenorDose> or just watch some gameplay before purchasing. its not hard to know whether or not you'll like a game
[0:27:20] <%MyNameIsRasus> @Standard_Enemy EA be like "FIVE SEC RULE"
[0:27:24] <@akuda_bar> i walked out of aquaman
[0:27:25] <%skyheys> the movie isnt 140 hours woolieMINHMAX
[0:27:26] <+Standard_Enemy> LUL
[0:27:28] <+arancet> "i hates my meal" "but you ate the whole thing"
[0:27:28] <@akuda_bar> what an awful movie
[0:27:53] <%Jack8274> I've seen a mom and kids yell at the poor teen for a refund at an AMC before. She got it lol
[0:27:55] <+ramenpoweredemo> I want my money back for the time i wasted
[0:28:04] <%Irridium> I walked out of Meet the Spartans, got a refund, and still felt like I got ripped off
[0:28:41] <%skyheys> That steak is THE SIZE OF MY HOURSE
[0:28:49] <%Terrarp> I wanted a refund after Star Wars 9 yet I stayed and hated every second of it
[0:28:54] <%Jack8274> IT WAS JUST SUCULENT CHINESE MEAL!
[0:28:55] <Althallos> @SenorDose only watching gameplay doesn't give you a feel for it though. I might love the way a fighting game looks but hate the feel of it
[0:28:56] <%Razputin217> Like that scene in Fast Times at Ridgemont High
[0:29:00] <+jiggy_snipe> those people are unreasonable and should be ignored
[0:29:04] <jorniev> HEY youtube plaque
[0:29:08] <%TitaniumDragoonNeo> YO WOOLIE, THE BANDANA LOOKS GOOD
[0:29:23] <%skyheys> carts could do that and stores didnt check your save anyway
[0:29:32] <CappuccinoGuil> I've seen so many "Good game, wait for it to be on sale because it's too expensive" on games that are 10-20 bucks. It's wild.
[0:29:37] <+ramenpoweredemo> i dont wanna deal with refund hassles so I just get all my games digital lol
[0:29:45] <jorniev> BALLS ON STREAM system
[0:29:47] <%Terrarp> Psn refunds are bullshit, they might as well not exist
[0:29:49] <SenorDose> @Althallos idk man. for me at least having played games for over 20 years, I just know when I see it

[2:53:22] <Takfloyd> @skyheys there's a lot of funny dialogue in those, you just missed it too
[2:53:24] <%gatorafan> SourPls
[2:53:26] <%Seancicle> Peace
[2:53:39] <%skyheys> @takfloyd I 100%ed the VN, they missed piss all
[2:53:50] <Takfloyd> I did the same, and youre wrong
[2:54:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yeah they havent missed anything
[2:54:03] <%skyheys> That's great that you think that
[2:54:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> anything that's that important or worth listening to
[2:54:45] <+JacknZack27> Theres a lot of good flavor text, I definitely liked reading it, but its not actually necessary.
[2:54:49] <Takfloyd> theres even multiple conversations in a row sometimes that you can miss
[2:55:04] <jorniev> what happened this session?
[2:55:05] <Takfloyd> none of it is plot important but it's still something to miss
[2:55:17] <+jiggy_snipe> flavor text isn't typically important but it's nice to read sometimes
[2:55:25] <%skyheys> Theres plenty of stuff you'll miss even if you scrub the game
[2:55:28] <+smartblue> I could care less about what they learn along the way in the vn because they can take it all apart in the analysis at the end anyway.
[2:55:37] <%skyheys> Like Aiba getting interrupted
[2:56:17] <Takfloyd> they clearly want to see as much as possible, what youre saying isnt a good excuse
[2:56:32] <+sigruned> in-ter-viewing
[2:56:33] <Takfloyd> "youll miss stuff anyway so why not just miss even more"
[2:56:38] <%skyheys> Go DM Woolie if you're that worried
[2:56:49] <SomersaultJustice> eh? what happened to the animals leaving? have they left?
[2:56:49] <Takfloyd> nah its not cool to backseat
[2:56:56] <Takfloyd> im just commenting after the fact
[2:57:09] <+smartblue> I don't think they've missed much? but man this game is impossible to talk about sometimes.
[2:57:14] <+jiggy_snipe> I heard he might have got DMCA for it maybe
[2:57:17] <+sigruned> in-ter-viewing

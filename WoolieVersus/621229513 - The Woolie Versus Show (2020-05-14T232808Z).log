[0:07:47] <Jack8274> SourPls
[0:08:01] <%FuqBoiSlim> wait youtube is down? is it just the desktop site or is the app down too?

[0:09:16] <%FuqBoiSlim> App is working for me right now. Might be cuz I'm using Vanced LUL
[0:09:23] <sfah_tham> it's back
[0:09:38] <%crimsonharvest> idk if its anyone's style but Groove Attack by infected mushroom always strikes me as a great fighting song
[0:10:34] <BoneBagMel> I knew woolie would play last step
[0:10:37] <+lizard_the_wiz> god this theme goes so fucking hard
[0:10:51] <Jack8274> SourPls
[0:10:56] <+ApocalypticExpress> Scrum Debate theme feels like a battle theme or a theme that would have been in smash. at least the composer got to remix Banjo Kazooie the.es And such for smash lol
[0:10:56] <Oak_bogle> I agree @crimsonharvest
[0:11:07] <%KosOrSomeSayKosm_> woolieYE
[0:11:07] <Twon_From_Wakanda> Did Woolie look at Ghost yet???

[0:11:35] <%Solidnick18> SourPls SourPls
[0:11:39] <DaKnightWarrior> FARTS PogChamp
[0:11:44] <+ApocalypticExpress> Ghost of Tsushima looks like someone got tired of waiting for assassin's creed to make Japan game so they made their own
[0:11:56] <Josef_Stryker> Man I have to wonder how they're gonna do Jolyne's beatdown theme when they get to her.
[0:11:56] <Fear_Ranjer> that sax is like SEX for the ears
[0:12:09] <Twon_From_Wakanda> @ApocalypticExpress did woolie watch it yet?
[0:12:12] <Josef_Stryker> Probably a shit ton of guitar riffs Jimi Hendrix style
[0:12:16] <%FuqBoiSlim> I missed the piano NotLikeThis
[0:12:16] <+ApocalypticExpress> it'll likely be a remix of Jotaros with something
[0:12:24] <%Fujiwara_92> YO SourPls
[0:12:25] <+ApocalypticExpress> @twon_from_wakanda not that I know.
[0:12:27] <%SuperKirby24> mmmmmm LUL

[0:12:50] <kei_ar_> 2 streams?
[0:12:52] <Josef_Stryker> Does it look good?
[0:12:55] <JetpackMcQuack> F.F. Voiced by dave grohl
[0:13:00] <Hemmy99> Really good
[0:13:02] <huskarl_zap> wtf is this trash
[0:13:03] <%FuqBoiSlim> The state of play definitely impressed me.
[0:13:03] <Twon_From_Wakanda> Ok I was hoping he would watch it on stream so we could see his reaction
[0:13:10] <Jack8274> @huskarl_zap Your trash!
[0:13:11] <Josef_Stryker> Yeah Dokapon earlier at 1 and GIFG now
[0:13:13] <@Menitta> NO, WOOLIE IS RIGHT
[0:13:23] <Josef_Stryker> What band is this? This sounds familiar
[0:13:23] <jubejube56> What......is this
[0:13:24] <%ChoculaUltra> reminder that Yellowcard is still suing Juicewrld despite Juicewrld passing away earlier this year.
[0:13:24] <@Menitta> THAT HYBRID SETUP IS GOOD
[0:13:25] <Jack8274> OH YEAH
[0:13:25] <%JustYudha> WHAT IS THIS
[0:13:28] <%Solidnick18> SourPls

[0:13:38] <Josef_Stryker> Ah
[0:13:39] <huskarl_zap> uccin greenday a weebery
[0:13:42] <Jack8274> Maybe Bionic Sage
[0:13:42] <%gatorafan> VoHiYo
[0:13:44] <Josef_Stryker> It's a mashup?
[0:13:45] <+CommanderBrocken> Silvagunner is respoonsible for this shit, aint he
[0:13:52] <JetpackMcQuack> cyrAYAYA
[0:13:53] <DaKnightWarrior> lytMYHERO
[0:13:54] <+ApocalypticExpress> it looks pretty. but as stated earlier also looks like an Assassin's Creed game, and I feel like the market oversaturated by its type of open world , stealth type game
[0:13:55] <CosmoSir> TaxiBro
[0:13:58] <%KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that's a real particular remix taste
[0:14:06] <huskarl_zap> greenday and weebery
[0:14:06] <%FuqBoiSlim> Nah, this sounds like a Love Live track so it's probably triple q
[0:14:07] <%gatorafan> cammyAYAYA
[0:14:09] <%Grizzytron> This one's a TripleQ
[0:14:14] <CosmoSir> OiMinna
[0:14:14] <%Solidnick18> Ghost state of play looked really cool.
[0:14:15] <+ApocalypticExpress> probs TripleQ
[0:14:20] <DoctorArby> Triple q ! doodAnime
[0:14:23] <huskarl_zap> Someone say the N word and save me from this

[0:14:24] <arkv01> tripleQ up in this biiitch
[0:14:31] <%tearknack> its got idolmaster sounding shit, this is defintly triple Q
[0:14:32] <%Fujiwara_92> SourPls

[0:15:02] <%tearknack> @perfectsalami not jrock, its idol shit
[0:15:02] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1260094696292048899
[0:15:08] <jubejube56> Probably would fit well it Air Gear actually
[0:15:09] <%Nekros4442> Oh it's love live?
[0:15:10] <%FuqBoiSlim> @choculaultra yeah that's pretty scummy of them
[0:15:12] <%Nekros4442> rofl
[0:15:14] <Oak_bogle> @huskarl_zap nachos.
[0:15:24] <+ApocalypticExpress> Wish Air Gear had continued
[0:15:29] <%Diana869> WAIT WHAT
[0:15:33] <+ApocalypticExpress> the anime that is
[0:15:36] <thewhiterice92> The manga finished and is compete
[0:15:48] <%Nekros4442> look....Air Gear is done. Let it die
[0:15:48] <%Diana869> What mix is this!?
[0:15:54] <%Nekros4442> The manga was stupid as fuck
[0:15:55] <+ApocalypticExpress> they should animate more of the series.
[0:16:04] <+ApocalypticExpress> the manga was so stupid it was great
[0:16:11] <Jack8274> Anyone have any romance anime/manga recommendations?
[0:16:11] <%Nekros4442> The last third of the manga went even stupider than Naruto
[0:16:20] <Nordguy> remember when ikki jumped over all those dudes?
[0:16:21] <jubejube56> And that is a bad thing?
[0:16:21] <%tearknack> @Nekros4442 i kinda loved it though
[0:16:23] <+ApocalypticExpress> the skates have stand beyblade spirits
[0:16:29] <kei_ar_> @Diana869 yellowcard snow helation
[0:16:34] <arkv01> now you got me wanting to rewatch the anime
[0:16:36] <%tearknack> @Nekros4442 remember when some girl traded bodies with OBAMA
[0:16:41] <%Diana869> @kei_ar_ thx
[0:16:44] <+Underachiever_Mako> YOOO
[0:16:44] <%FuqBoiSlim> Air Gear was cool to me as a kid cuz it was my seeing first time a fat dark skin dude in an anime and he wasnt a one-off villain
[0:16:44] <%tearknack> i fucking laughed so hard
[0:16:44] <huskarl_zap> Thank chrisst its over
[0:16:59] <huskarl_zap> lol soy face woolie
[0:16:59] <%Fujiwara_92> SourPls
[0:17:02] <kei_ar_> i thought air gear was fake the first time i saw it
[0:17:02] <DSD24> Yay castlevania music
[0:17:26] <+ApocalypticExpress> @fuqboislim he also just gets super buff by compressing the fat or some bullshit
[0:17:27] <+Underachiever_Mako> Last Blade is sickkk
[0:17:33] <+sonofloki1> Love castlevania music
[0:17:37] <%SuperKirby24> pat-rat NotLikeThis
[0:17:39] <%tearknack> air gear was a normal sort of shonen battle anime about a wierd hobby, with air gear's titular sport being about magic roller blades
[0:17:47] <+Underachiever_Mako> already betting on Woolie playing the broken guy
[0:18:00] <%FuqBoiSlim> @apocalypticexpress damn I forgot about that. sounds crazy lol
[0:18:02] <devilmaydie756> that face LUL
[0:18:10] <%tearknack> but air gear was way more R rated than bleyblade or whatever, and went arguably even DUMBER CRAZIER places
[0:18:17] <%Nekros4442> @tearknack it took magic roller blades into actual godhood messiah bs
[0:18:17] <+ApocalypticExpress> @tearknack until it started being about weird experiments to make super soldiers who skate
[0:18:29] <thewhiterice92> Air gear also had fat tits and ass
[0:18:35] <arkv01> IIRC air gear had raw tiddy on sccreen?
[0:18:49] <Josef_Stryker> On another note, I started playing Doom Eternal again because Woolie started the LP
[0:18:52] <thewhiterice92> @arkv01 the manga did
[0:18:53] <%tearknack> @thewhiterice92 as i said, the ra rated equivalent of beyblade and so on
[0:18:55] <Josef_Stryker> Man is it so fun
[0:18:56] <%tearknack> @arkv01 yep
[0:19:03] <Josef_Stryker> Can't wait for the campaign DLC to come out.
[0:19:07] <+ApocalypticExpress> @tearknack come one the author's name is Oh Great! what else can one expect. (his art evolution is also some incredible stuff during Tenjo Tenge
[0:19:18] <%FuqBoiSlim> I'll never forget that dude with an eyepatch with split personalities and confused me for like a year
[0:19:23] <%tearknack> i repeat, OBAMA switchs bodies with one of the hangers on supporting cast girls for a solid ten chapters or so
[0:19:25] <Josef_Stryker> I wonder if they can find remotely decent replacement for Mick tho
[0:19:41] <Oak_bogle> Anyone out there Castlevania SotN ps one game in a CD player? “This is a PlayStation black disk. Track one contains computer data so you shouldn’t play it, but you probably won’t listen will you”
[0:19:44] <Josef_Stryker> It sucks that Bethesda dicked him over.
[0:19:56] <Oak_bogle> Put *
[0:20:06] <%tearknack> @FuqBoiSlim im not gonna lie, eyepatch dude was one of a number of early AWAKENINGS that happened throughout my anime watching career
[0:20:10] <+ApocalypticExpress> @fuqboislim he is the split of his sister who is also the split
[0:20:29] <KAISERWAVE> OH DANG
[0:20:38] <%tearknack> @Josef_Stryker tbf it seems like Mic also jsut failed to do his job given extra time? Like, fuck bethesda, but Mic doesn't seem blameless here
[0:20:38] <reonome> SourPls
[0:20:44] <%Solidnick18> SourPls
[0:20:46] <mdkcde> @Josef_Stryker It's more than he fucked himself over
[0:20:48] <armchairmaster_> Darlington?
[0:20:52] <%SuperKirby24> SourPls
[0:20:56] <jubejube56> Theme of Darklington
[0:21:01] <+ApocalypticExpress> @tearknack the opening is still something I like to return to and still love the part of Eyepatch dude just grinding on roofs
[0:21:06] <+sonofloki1> Ah good ol Jenova
[0:21:07] <arkv01> theme of mmmother
[0:21:12] <Josef_Stryker> I just hope they find a decent composer for the DLC
[0:21:12] <BoneBagMel> mmmother
[0:21:16] <mdkcde> Didn't deliver on time because he is a perfectionist and then got publically salty about it
[0:21:20] <Josef_Stryker> Unless they go the lazy route and just recycle old tracks
[0:21:21] <wolvenelf> s
[0:21:25] <artificiallynatural> LAST BLADE 2
[0:21:29] <artificiallynatural> LETS GO
[0:21:29] <DaKnightWarrior> who made this remix. i'm always looking foe it?
[0:21:34] <%tearknack> @ApocalypticExpress i also liked air gear cause i didn't do skatebaords, but i did do rollerblades a bit
[0:21:37] <DaKnightWarrior> *for
[0:21:39] <+ApocalypticExpress> like if they did a revival of the anime nowadays I'd love to see them work the skate parkour stuff in better animation
[0:21:44] <arkv01> sounds like OCremix
[0:21:48] <%optimasmaximas> thank god i got here before they started
[0:21:50] <Josef_Stryker> Man I'm happy I finally played FF7 so I know what these tracks are
[0:21:52] <arkv01> which helps fuck all but hey theres only so many jenova remixes there
[0:21:59] <%optimasmaximas> cant wait to hear woolie talk about evo
[0:22:04] <arkv01> might be DJpretzel
[0:22:05] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:22:05] <%tearknack> @ApocalypticExpress and combat roller blade parkour is dope
[0:22:06] <AkumaFalcon93> need this song. anyone know what it is
[0:22:16] <%tearknack> @AkumaFalcon93 is that a joke?
[0:22:23] <imbuildinggundams> Okay, so who's the Setsuna main
[0:22:25] <DXLelouch24> @Josef_Stryker now play New Threat MaxmillianDood stamp of approval
[0:22:28] <%tearknack> @AkumaFalcon93 if not, jenova's theme from ff7
[0:22:29] <mdkcde> dumped it all on the audio engineer at bethesda because he HAD to deliver the work on time with unclean, low quality assets. Which was in part Mitch's fault.
[0:22:39] <%FuqBoiSlim> damn I still need to finish FF7. I got out of midgar, saw the gigantic world map and said "I'll pick this up later" and I never did
[0:22:45] <DaKnightWarrior> @arkv01 thanks i will look them up.
[0:22:55] <%tearknack> @AkumaFalcon93 well, some version of it, anyways
[0:22:55] <Josef_Stryker> @DXLelouch24 What's that?
[0:22:57] <+ApocalypticExpress> @tearknack Yeh . I kinda have game concepts and such running in my head inspired by Air Gear. that shit defined a part of my childhood/early teens
[0:22:59] <AkumaFalcon93> not an ff guy. thanks though

[0:27:19] <%perfectsalami> yeah
[0:27:48] <%RioGascar> I think some of my messages have gotten eaten as well
[0:27:54] <%That_Mojo> the last bladde 2? what the 2nd to last bladde
[0:28:00] <%perfectsalami> I was just checking if the messages would get through if i donated during the sub reading. and they didnt.
[0:28:01] <Leonavius> oh it wasn't just me earlier then
[0:28:09] <arkv01> two balls, one soul
[0:28:29] <@Solidus_113> more streams give more opportunities for people to donate, but YT gives the paycheck
[0:28:30] <Jetsfantasy> But also youtube is hot garbage for daily live stuff
[0:28:32] <%RioGascar> tho they were when I changed my username to “saul goodman or jimmy mcgill” for my dumb donation gimmicks
[0:28:32] <%AlteisenReiseZ> cheer500 Blood for the bloodpool! Also been playing One Step from Eden almost nonstop, that game is LEGIT.
[0:28:38] <arkv01> also streams are HYPE
[0:28:41] <%Grayhammatter> YT gives the dosh
[0:28:47] <%Solidnick18> youtube is the bread and butter.
[0:28:51] <DedlokPM> Plus the Twitch stuff is him doing the recording stuff for youtube/the podcast but on the internet instead of offline
[0:28:54] <DoctorArby> Twitch is sidehustle... YT is the main bread
[0:28:55] <%thespacerunaway> @Solidus_113 Never said a truer word
[0:28:59] <arkv01> youtube is the john that pays

[0:32:13] <NewJerseyTV> So it's PS4? You said PC 4 times so PS4?
[0:32:14] <%RioGascar> Kurosawa filter?

[0:32:34] <+bladeofSorensen> sarvetInTHERE
[0:32:37] <%Nekros4442> You have to just win the game lol
[0:32:48] <%Nekros4442> It's a pve game first
[0:32:50] <artificiallynatural> gotta get to at least stage 4 to start unlocking the characters
[0:32:50] <Triplicat> might need to cop a save from someone to do that
[0:32:57] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @WoolieVersus It's a process dude, you gotta unlock. PVE first...
[0:33:04] <Zayasu> is there a good deal for the game somewhere?
[0:33:07] <Triplicat> I didn't even know chars were locked in PVP in the first place
[0:33:41] <TigerClaws12> unless someone can export a save
[0:33:43] <+arancet> it took me 4-5 hours of total steam time to get full unlocks, not bad, but still, your time is valuable
[0:33:44] <%nawji> nawji subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Hey woolz, you have designs down the line to look at Lethal League Blaze for GIFG? Game is still tight!
[0:33:45] <%Nekros4442> Did you grab a save file then?
[0:33:51] <artificiallynatural> someone can probably send you a save then

[1:35:54] <%KosOrSomeSayKosm_> chat is FED with codes
[1:35:56] <+wardenofwinter> Mortal Kombat Kollection FIQN9-F3E2F-HJC?X /// ?=6
[1:36:02] <NiktenKing> Is that a morphing owl?
[1:36:07] <huskarl_zap> nani
[1:36:15] <rsg220> this is a rushdown of codes
[1:36:30] <+leomc2> jesus yall are genorous
[1:36:38] <rkblitz> wow that mk code is super rare
[1:36:46] <townzzzzz> 4 ways of inputting it btw
[1:36:47] <jubejube56> Just reminds me of Legends of Ga'Hool
[1:36:57] <%ChoculaUltra> holy damage
[1:36:57] <%Nekros4442> Jesus christ.....Woolie I spent 10 minutes in training mode and found a really stupid loop/infinite with Akari
[1:36:58] <drefizz> My social security number 1
[1:37:01] <%Malik1002> @woolieversus Got to power up with double half circle strong/ then use forward half circle strong and light attack together
[1:37:02] <%optimasmaximas> @wardenofwinter for what?
[1:37:07] <+wardenofwinter> Steam
[1:37:09] <+TheOneCalledRock> ok so, my recommendation is anyone got any codes wait a bit, caus a lot of people are locked out
[1:37:14] <Manwad> God these sprites are gorgous
[1:37:28] <KAISERWAVE> standard is ABC, ABC, AB then 236 C
[1:37:39] <%legacy0117> They are.
[1:37:55] <+gaomachine> Zanetsu reminds me of Wins Without a Knife from Master of the Flying Guillotine.. who shamelessly exploits the Martial Arts Moniker by packing knives to stab folks with when they least expect it.
[1:37:56] <drefizz> does this game have date-able waifus?
[1:37:57] <NiktenKing> ENIG WHAT? cmonBruh
[1:38:14] <+TheOneCalledRock> i think the lockout timer is 30 mins?
[1:38:15] <jubejube56> @drefizz define "date-able"
[1:38:29] <arkv01> will they cut your dick off? 80/20
[1:38:39] <jubejube56> They likely could if they wanted to
[1:38:40] <drefizz> legal age and can be asked out in the game @jubejube56
[1:38:42] <majinken> If you have flash on it can be a better indication to press the next button
[1:38:56] <%JBoogieG> Last one from me tonight
[1:39:02] <%Grayhammatter> wow, nice
[1:39:17] <TacoBomber> looks like he was headpatting

[1:39:40] <drefizz> that flashing light meters are hard to look at
[1:39:43] <KAISERWAVE> Setsuna is suuuuch a good starting character

[1:40:16] <majinken> @GalacticaPhanto nope
[1:40:26] <%SomersaultJustice> I think there might be an ACA release on the switch of the first game
[1:40:27] <NiktenKing> It's on the collection I think

[1:42:26] <KAISERWAVE> Doesn't Mukuro have an unblockable?
[1:42:33] <NiktenKing> Mukuro reminds me of Kazeshini from Bleach
[1:42:37] <%ChoculaUltra> I still say Moriya was totally 100% designed after Seijuro Hiko from RRK
[1:42:49] <%ChoculaUltra> or just Kenshin vibes in general
[1:42:53] <%Grayhammatter> aw no
[1:42:57] <%SirGO0SE> it does remind me of Kenshin but with less pedophilia
[1:42:58] <+leomc2> its always cool hearing/finding out what parts of the Get into fighting games intros is from which game.
[1:42:58] <arkv01> un UNG UNG UNGA
[1:42:59] <artificiallynatural> the timing is so strict on that
[1:43:04] <%SomersaultJustice> @KAISERWAVE is there something wrong with iroha's opening and ending story cutscenes on samsho switch? when I start them it just shows a black screen
[1:43:05] <huskarl_zap> I cant buy the game because I've been attempting steam codes
[1:43:09] <dweebenheimer20> The kenshin creator got a lot of designs from samsho, so that wouldnt surprise me

[1:55:48] <Alseid> The thing about LB characters is, they look like one Kenshin character, they fight like another. Kagami looks like Aoshi, fights like Shishio
[1:55:50] <Naho_Saenoki> THEN I WAS RIGHT
[1:55:50] <+Dreday543> i was gonna say, thats dumbest and best
[1:56:10] <%WutangchickeN> yo real talk I don't really care about the fighting games but seeing woolz and Reggie get hype makes the streams/vids hype

[2:45:37] <TigerClaws12> this game has infinites

[2:52:18] <+big_bang_blitz_> funny how kagami sounds like yagami though, huh
[2:52:22] <+jetjagger222> @RioGascar its pretty simple to pick up; first thing's you gotta know which buttons are cancelable
[2:52:24] <%legacy0117> He is not one with his stick.
[2:52:25] <BlacSoul> @big_bang_blitz_ THAT JUST MAKES HIM COOLER, since its not just Broody McEdgelord

[2:54:44] <%Nekros4442> Does Woolie have a discord?
[2:54:45] <+ElectricFoxLex> Ukemi is not safe
[2:54:47] <majinken> @WoolieVersus D as you touch the ground
[2:54:56] <%theman515> !discord
[2:54:57] <%Wool> @Nekros4442 Link's on the TwoBestFriendsPlay subreddit
[2:55:27] <Mr_McFries> do it do it do it
[2:55:38] <Mr_McFries> ah
[2:55:42] <+ElectricFoxLex> Reggie, if you do his teleport and press A+C during teleport you get 0 frames of recovery during teleport
[2:55:44] <+big_bang_blitz_> what a pose
[2:55:44] <Wan6Saber> WOW
[2:55:46] <DedlokPM> poor yuki doodSad
[2:55:49] <+jetjagger222> that ryu pose
[2:55:51] <@Menitta> GG @WoolieVersus
[2:56:01] <+big_bang_blitz_> what a magical game
[2:56:05] <Mr_McFries> JACKU
[2:56:07] <+ElectricFoxLex> You can do deflect super but you have very little time to do so
[2:56:07] <Nny7229> Are they planning on checking out the Ghosts gameplay after this?
[2:56:08] <majinken> @WoolieVersus You can deflect super
[2:56:10] <@Menitta> Damn, that fuckin deflect
[2:56:16] <+big_bang_blitz_> oh hey you guys nee dto try the secret character
[2:56:24] <+ElectricFoxLex> Also you can deflect supers
[2:56:26] <%ChoculaUltra> Show me a good time, Jack!
[2:56:32] <%Jack8274> i suck btw
[2:56:33] <Mr_McFries> ah the little heart
[2:56:37] <%SirGO0SE> Jack, the fastest fingers in the west
[2:56:37] <%ChoculaUltra> That's the spirit!
[2:56:42] <+jetjagger222> you can be crueler than that
[2:56:43] <+big_bang_blitz_> no theres a non boss exclusive
[2:56:49] <+big_bang_blitz_> you gotta do it
[2:56:51] <+ElectricFoxLex> And you can deflect specials too
[2:56:55] <bleugh> are the last blades connected to samsho in any way? both made by snk right?
[2:56:57] <%stote45> you might have to hold forward as you hid d if I'm not mistaken
[2:56:59] <+jetjagger222> oh no he knows
[2:57:00] <%gatorafan> Ye Kagami was the last boss of the first game
[2:57:03] <Mr_McFries> well now I wanna see the bow and arrow
[2:57:05] <+TempXa> God the animation in this game is fucking fantastic.
[2:57:12] <artificiallynatural> samsho and last blade take place in completely different eras
[2:57:17] <+ElectricFoxLex> So if you see a special with a gap in it, press Deflect
[2:57:19] <DedlokPM> @bleugh both made by snk but think that is the extent of the connection
[2:57:28] <%ChoculaUltra> I would definitely follow Amano around calling him bossu had I lived in that era.
[2:57:46] <%Grayhammatter> the spacing
[2:57:53] <Mr_McFries> @ChoculaUltra and he'd be the guy to be like "ah come on, don't call me that!"
[2:57:55] <+jetjagger222> technically both have vague connections to KoF/AoF; zantetsu is eiji's ancestor, hanzo also has that brazilian ninja guy in XIV
[2:57:58] <+big_bang_blitz_> Nah Kotetsu isnt a boss
[2:58:06] <+ElectricFoxLex> Also short run A is super good
[2:58:16] <+big_bang_blitz_> also on eof the character alts is like darkstalkers puppet/shadow mode
[2:58:19] <+ElectricFoxLex> Which one Woolie, the rekka or the DP?
[2:58:23] <TigerClaws12> you can do a 2nd DP in Speed mode
[2:58:35] <%Jack8274> THE PANIC WAS REAL
[2:58:36] <+gaomachine> PREDICTABO!
[2:58:36] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:58:41] <%SirGO0SE> WATAAAA
[2:58:42] <%ChoculaUltra> @Mr_McFries LUL
[2:58:42] <+big_bang_blitz_> kotetsu is shigens daughter
[2:58:51] <+big_bang_blitz_> she is the best secret character maybe ever
[2:59:01] <%Jack8274> I got bodied
[2:59:06] <majinken> @WoolieVersus also last boss has the 4 gods of north south east and west
[2:59:07] <+jetjagger222> good show dude
[2:59:07] <%Jetzord> @jack8274 Good hustle man, you did your bsst
[2:59:08] <%Jack8274> gg
[2:59:09] <rsg220> if there is any character that it makes sense doesnt know what they're doing, it's amano
[2:59:11] <%gatorafan> Something tells me all that talent to catch codes didn't translate...
[2:59:18] <%Typhaeon> Wish they made the netplay UI a litttle more consistent with the rest of the game's artstyle
[2:59:23] <%Typhaeon> It's very flat and modern
[2:59:24] <Mr_McFries> OH FUCK HE BIG
[2:59:26] <moogleboy1984> Where my Hibiki mains at?
[2:59:27] <+ElectricFoxLex> Try Speed Shigen
[2:59:37] <ZippyPsycho> Speed Shigen is like top tier
[2:59:39] <%ChoculaUltra> Jack's speed can be honed and forged into a sharp blade in time.
[2:59:40] <+jetjagger222> speed shigen is hype
[2:59:41] <rsg220> everybody in here trying to FUCK and DRINK

[3:09:55] <Wan6Saber> athSM
[3:09:57] <DXLelouch24> BOOOOURNS
[3:10:01] <+TempXa> Easier to play.
[3:10:02] <%Irridium> easy to make
[3:10:02] <+ninja_galt> we need 50 more viewers stat
[3:10:03] <+TempXa> Yep.
[3:10:04] <+jetjagger222> blame cyberconnect
[3:10:05] <+TempXa> That's it
[3:10:09] <+TempXa> It's just easier
[3:10:10] <@Menitta> In addition to this game getting rollback, Samurai Shodown 5 Special, Garou Mark of the Wolves, and KOF 97 Global Match got rollback
[3:10:16] <%Diana869> they seem very easy
[3:10:19] <TigerClaws12> Tenkaichi started that nonsense
[3:10:20] <%kyh9> RPGs are easy too tho. No Naruto JRPG franchise with fancy animations?
[3:10:24] <+TempXa> 2D is much much more intimate
[3:10:25] <%GenesisKnight> Easier to learn and less work to do the big cool thing
[3:10:32] <%SirGO0SE> i might get in on garou now
[3:10:33] <TheGershon> they're just trying to chase the success that ninja storm had
[3:10:34] <+jetjagger222> press button, see cool siht
[3:10:35] <Mr_McFries> less work=good
[3:10:42] <%ChoculaUltra> can we get CvS2 and SVC Chaos steam ports with rollback tho????
[3:10:43] <Arek_1> Bandai Namco, using their anime licenses, just spits out arena fighters every year.
[3:10:53] <%RioGascar> basically all of snks best classic games got rollback
[3:10:54] <+big_bang_blitz_> 98 should be next to get rollback
[3:11:07] <+big_bang_blitz_> some shits gonna go down
[3:11:08] <+TungstenViper> we'll never get another All Star Battle again :(
[3:11:08] <+TempXa> It also looks more like the show
[3:11:16] <%ChoculaUltra> if Bamco put a fraction of the effort that ArkSys put into DBZ into Jump Force the game could've been insane.
[3:11:21] <Zayasu> i would say its the ip's smash has but brawlhalla has like 15k players online on steam WutFace
[3:11:25] <Arek_1> Arena fighters are just cash cows.
[3:11:30] <%RioGascar> also im thankful the new ones have replaced the shitty dotemu "ports"
[3:11:39] <%Irridium> Arena fighters peaked with Anarchy Reigns
[3:11:47] <%RioGascar> i got the whole snk collection in a humble bundle and man the dotemu ones were bad
[3:11:49] <+ninja_galt> I want a 4D fighting gamer
[3:11:49] <+jetjagger222> @RioGascar i still bought those
[3:11:50] <%Fujiwara_92> 3d arena fighters are 1v1 musous Kappa
[3:11:52] <%kyh9> I just want good Anime fighting games
[3:12:01] <+jetjagger222> regrets were had
[3:12:02] <Mr_McFries> 6D CHESS FIGHTING GAME
[3:12:07] <%kyh9> I just dream of a Bleach x SamSho game
[3:12:09] <@Solidus_113> you can make the simplification comparison, but then you have Tekken 7 that's super deep
[3:12:12] <+ninja_galt> 4d fighter would use a slowmo button like max payne
[3:12:20] <%ChoculaUltra> That one YYH fighting game by Treasure for the Sega Genesis is one of my all time favorites.
[3:12:24] <+Dreday543> Thanks for getting me into this fighting game
[3:12:24] <Shardlab> Bleach had a good set of fighters on DS

[3:22:01] <Oxybe> doodMaxhype doodMaxhype doodMaxhype doodMaxhype doodMaxhype
[3:22:03] <%ChoculaUltra> kinda shocked Capcom never cashed in on the gacha game craze with a MMBN game. It would've made insane amounts of cash.
[3:22:05] <+jetjagger222> wait she does resemble the not-roll from MM9
[3:22:06] <artificiallynatural> gonna be rough the first time, but hey they reduced the difficulty spike at least

[3:22:30] <Shardlab> That difficulty has been turned down a tad
[3:22:34] <Oxybe> MMBN was 3x3
[3:22:37] <@Solidus_113> GBA Games
[3:22:41] <TheGershon> battle network was 3x3
[3:22:52] <Shardlab> They realized we all don't have Jedi reflexes
[3:22:56] <artificiallynatural> this game is much more chaotic and bullet-helly compared to battle network
[3:22:57] <%Grayhammatter> it's so good
[3:22:57] <drefizz> what was that 3d NT warrior game?
[3:23:06] <%Fujiwara_92> MMBN IS THE BEST

[3:26:02] <%Nekros4442> @WoolieVersus Do you guys want to try using my save file so you get the characters unlocked?
[3:26:05] <artificiallynatural> we can send it to you and you can drop a save into the files
[3:26:07] <%Tearonex> Fuck, woolie has all the characters I don't!
[3:26:13] <%tearknack> i guess not everything has to be online
[3:26:17] <NiktenKing> Because you can still do PvP
[3:26:20] <%Nekros4442> @WoolieVersus I could let you use my account via Family Sharing and then you can get the savefile from the cloud
[3:26:32] <%ChoculaUltra> I got my friends to play Zone of the Enders after hours of just dicking around in the Versus mode.
[3:26:32] <%Tearonex> Except for Reva, she's my girl!
[3:26:34] <@Menitta> Hazel is awesome
[3:26:46] <%legacy0117> Looks really nice. For sure.

[3:29:09] <+Aeoneth> I abused folder reset
[3:29:14] <%Grayhammatter> LUL

[3:29:29] <%FuqBoiSlim> Reggie won and didnt even know how. you love to see it woolieREGGIEFUL
[3:29:32] <DedlokPM> @legacy0117 pretty sure most of the Battle Network games were link cable local multiplayer
[3:29:42] <+Aeoneth> Woolie your gun ony does 1 damage and Reggies char regens shield at 1 pt/s
[3:29:47] <@Menitta> this game can get super one sided lol
[3:29:49] <Mr_McFries> I love it when someone is newish to a game and then dominates
[3:29:52] <%Jack8274> LUL This is nuts
[3:29:57] <fangovafang> Reggie is learning doodLUL doodLUL doodLUL doodLUL
[3:29:59] <%SirGO0SE> @FuqBoiSlim the reggie special woolieREGGIEFUL
[3:29:59] <%GenesisKnight> I don't remember battle network being this fast paced. Maybe I've just gotten old.
[3:30:00] <+RenoDeGeneric> Yo I didn't get to play ya earlier, but I wanted to say thanks again for the Last Blade code guys!
[3:30:05] <%legacy0117> This might be game I I'll buy, although I also really want World of Horrors but I'll just have to see if I can get both.
[3:30:06] <%ChoculaUltra> there was that one MMBN game for the gamecube that played like a classic megaman game. That shit was absurdly hard for it's time.
[3:30:22] <%SirGO0SE> SALT
[3:30:22] <Mr_McFries> GUNNER
[3:30:23] <KRaZyAmmo> what kind of game is this?
[3:30:27] <KRaZyAmmo> it looks awesome
[3:30:27] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Hell yeah Reggie
[3:30:27] <NiktenKing> Get this game on Switch
[3:30:29] <%Nekros4442> @WoolieVersus Do you guys want to use my account so you get a save file with skins and characters unlocked?
[3:30:29] <+RenoDeGeneric> Megaman Network Transmission is STILL hard as shit. That game is brutal
[3:30:30] <+pectusumbra> mmbn in it's base game was not this crazy, it got nuts in later/post game stuff
[3:30:31] <@Menitta> Selicy is Vergil
[3:30:32] <%Jack8274> Selicy Kreygasm
[3:30:38] <@Menitta> She has summon swords
[3:30:39] <Mr_McFries> GUNNER MUST WIN
[3:30:39] <NiktenKing> It's a good portable game
[3:30:42] <%Diana869> get this game on everything
[3:30:45] <+NekoNinja13> man I would love to show off Violette to these guys
[3:30:46] <%Jack8274> Selicy, that hair, that tooth, oh my
[3:30:51] <%legacy0117> Alas my sandbox exploring soul wants World of Horrors first.
[3:30:53] <%FuqBoiSlim> lemme check this out later then...
[3:30:58] <%Typhaeon> Zoned to fuck
[3:30:59] <+Aeoneth> This game on Switch unfortunately suffers from extreme lag on later stages because there's TOO MUCH shit being rendered for it to keep track of
[3:31:01] <%Nekros4442> Use your spells Reggie lol
[3:31:05] <Arek_1> Back when I played MMBN3 in middle school against kids in school, I cheezed with a 2xHero folder. LUL
[3:31:09] <artificiallynatural> oh no. they have no idea how to use the weapons. oh fuck my minmax
[3:31:12] <NiktenKing> Gunner is busted
[3:31:24] <fangovafang> it escalated so fast lol
[3:31:27] <@Solidus_113> this is a bad matchup
[3:31:33] <Shardlab> All that meter Reggie ain't using
[3:31:35] <artificiallynatural> blew himself up LUL
[3:31:36] <+dmtjinni> LUL
[3:31:44] <%Andrizzleton> damn some characters are just broken
[3:31:44] <staranon1> Dudes. We totally need a new Batle Network game.
[3:31:45] <NiktenKing> Selicy is really only usable with frost
[3:31:59] <Mr_McFries> @Aeoneth The ultimate downside of the switch. I really wish they would release a slightly beefed up version
[3:32:01] <%Diana869> no
[3:32:02] <+Aeoneth> Or on her invader setup
[3:32:09] <%Typhaeon> Think he figured it out boys
[3:32:11] <%legacy0117> Sandbox Loving soul* I meant to say.
[3:32:12] <Arek_1> Disco Inferno folder in MMBN3 was fire.
[3:32:13] <%FuqBoiSlim> I need something play that isnt aminal corssing before the w101 remaster drops. I'll check this out
[3:32:15] <NiktenKing> Gunner's weakness is that missing basic attack shots makes you lose mana
[3:32:21] <@Menitta> If you stack frost, Selicy does 80 damage per frost
[3:32:34] <stormhawk9891> @Typhaeon I doubt they'll be figuring anything out
[3:32:46] <jubejube56> Is this fighting games?
[3:32:46] <+Aeoneth> on top of the regular 100 for a frost burst? nice
[3:32:51] <jubejube56> Looks like mega man
[3:32:53] <+dmtjinni> CLUTCH
[3:32:54] <artificiallynatural> gunner's mana gain is based on landing his shots, selicy's weapon deals damage based on how much frost she stacks
[3:32:56] <Mr_McFries> YES GUNNER
[3:33:02] <%Typhaeon> @stormhawk9891 They're figuring out how to pres butan Kappa
[3:33:05] <%legacy0117> This is so much more fast paced than MMBN. x3
[3:33:05] <%Nekros4442> @WoolieVersus Did you want to try to Steam Share my Library so you get the characters and skins?
[3:33:16] <NiktenKing> Violette is the most fun to play
[3:33:16] <Arek_1> Are there Program Advances?
[3:33:18] <fangovafang> this is for real chess players NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:33:20] <+Aeoneth> Someone get Woolie a save file Stat
[3:33:26] <Manwad> if only we could see their reaction to either Violette loadouts
[3:33:27] <FrostedZaibatsu> @Arek_1 no
[3:33:28] <%Nekros4442> @Aeoneth I'm trying lol
[3:33:33] <+Aeoneth> I wanna see these chuckleheads try and play Violetta
[3:33:37] <Arek_1> @FrostedZaibatsu Aww.
[3:33:41] <artificiallynatural> I love terra. Her crowd control can be so bullshit
[3:33:43] <NiktenKing> Violette is some big brain levels of think
[3:33:47] <+pectusumbra> gotta land your spells
[3:33:51] <@Menitta> This game is like bowling but without the dice
[3:33:51] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:33:53] <%Wool> Melee only does damage if you apply Frost atacks first
[3:33:53] <+pectusumbra> your basic attack is not that strong
[3:33:54] <%Nekros4442> YOu have to actually use your spells
[3:34:00] <stormhawk9891> @WoolieVersus Melee damage is based on frost stacks
[3:34:10] <%Wool> Selicy does 80 damage per frost stack with her weapon
[3:34:10] <+bigb00gi3> the trick with selicy's melee is to land frost on her targets first, the melee picks it off for damage
[3:34:15] <FrostedZaibatsu> @Arek_1 there a common rare and legendary mods tho. Kinda makes up for it
[3:34:23] <%Typhaeon> Spamming light melee isn't working, better do it more
[3:34:47] <%legacy0117> At least the melee keeps you away from explosions on your side
[3:34:50] <%Nekros4442> @WoolieVersus Did you want to try to Steam Share my Library so you get the characters and skins?
[3:34:59] <NiktenKing> Don't dash as Selicy. Use your frost spells first, then cash in with dash
[3:35:01] <%Wool> Saffron keeping her revive skill is pretty OD lmao
[3:35:01] <+Aeoneth> Saffron gets a 2nd wind
[3:35:21] <%legacy0117> A revive? Cool.
[3:35:31] <huskarl_zap> these thots
[3:35:43] <+Aeoneth> Gunner is a guy
[3:35:54] <%Jack8274> That shield recharges so fast!
[3:36:07] <huskarl_zap> manthot
[3:36:10] <Arek_1> I played MMBN3 and 4 as a kid. When I browsed GameFAQs back in the day, I've always heard that 2 was where it's at.
[3:36:16] <%ledshamans> ledshamans subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[3:36:21] <fangovafang> lmao
[3:36:23] <%legacy0117> Shield is reliable, for sure.
[3:36:26] <KRaZyAmmo> I never played any of the MMBN games =(
[3:36:31] <kei_ar_> what was thename of this game again?
[3:36:36] <artificiallynatural> One step from eden
[3:36:40] <%legacy0117> But makes her really slow
[3:36:43] <%Typhaeon> No meter vs all the meter in the world
[3:36:44] <%tearknack> @KRaZyAmmo neither did I, although, wierdly, i did read the manga
[3:36:45] <+dmtjinni> Gunner is a SHE, plz check the dev teitter
[3:36:51] <+NekoNinja13> one step from eden @kei_ar_
[3:36:53] <%SirGO0SE> all the mmbn games are great to emulate on mobile
[3:36:55] <busstawolf> she regains shield each time she moves
[3:37:03] <Manwad> gunner's a dude, what
[3:37:05] <%Jack8274> GO REGGIE!
[3:37:13] <artificiallynatural> what an amazing fight LUL
[3:37:23] <KRaZyAmmo> clutch it woolie clutch!
[3:37:29] <+mastermau> Yoooo
[3:37:35] <+mastermau> Big Baller Brand!!!
[3:37:38] <%legacy0117> The name isn't helping your case bud.
[3:37:44] <+dmtjinni> CLUTCH

[3:37:55] <+dmtjinni> LUL

[3:37:58] <%Grayhammatter> jesus LUL
[3:37:58] <%Jack8274> REGGIE OMG YOU LEGEND!
[3:38:06] <omnicrescendo> omnicrescendo subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:38:11] <%Wool> Reggie stop spamming your weapon lmao
[3:38:11] <%legacy0117> LAST PIXEL
[3:38:15] <%FuqBoiSlim> He did it again boys woolieREGGIEFUL woolieREGGIEFUL woolieREGGIEFUL
[3:38:37] <+mastermau> this game looks INSANE
[3:38:42] <%Jack8274> OOOF
[3:38:43] <stormhawk9891> I know they're new but oh man this painful watch after playing it so much NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:38:58] <%legacy0117> So Gunner builds more damage if he waits? Sounds like a sniper for sure.
[3:39:01] <Manwad> yeah, 5 damage parry, yeah
[3:39:02] <+Aeoneth> They're PLaying at about a Stage 2 level while they learn
[3:39:11] <+CMash2k> damn reg u good bro?
[3:39:15] <+NekoNinja13> honestly they're learning kinda fast for literally just starting
[3:39:18] <NiktenKing> Gunner spamming auto is like... scrublevel
[3:39:27] <%legacy0117> And trap bombs!
[3:39:28] <stormhawk9891> @legacy0117 Gunner regains mp by landing shots with his normal
[3:39:34] <@Menitta> the music of this game slaps
[3:39:39] <Arek_1> Reggie would love Guts Style. LUL
[3:39:43] <%legacy0117> Ahhhhh.
[3:39:53] <NiktenKing> Violette's OST is so damn good
[3:39:53] <Shardlab> Can't mess with Phalanx
[3:40:03] <NiktenKing> Her boss fight is literally a rhythm game
[3:40:03] <Arek_1> And Woolie would love Shield Style. LUL
[3:40:07] <Shardlab> Phalanx/Hexawan build
[3:40:07] <%ekodrop> what is this megaman battle network?
[3:40:32] <+Aeoneth> basically eko
[3:40:52] <kei_ar_> i never got to play battle network this looks fun as hell
[3:40:53] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:40:53] <NiktenKing> Tank is not annoying... you just gotta use spells...
[3:40:55] <%Nekros4442> @WoolieVersus Did you want to try to Steam Share my Library so you get the characters and skins?
[3:41:11] <%Nekros4442> K
[3:41:28] <Shardlab> Ya'll are spamming your basic attack too much to build mana
[3:41:29] <%Solidnick18> strive got delayed to next year
[3:41:29] <stormhawk9891> @WoolieVersus Selicy's melee damage is based on frost stacks
[3:41:35] <%legacy0117> It is an old Gameboy Advance and onward Megaman series that plays exactly this Ekodrop
[3:41:36] <KRaZyAmmo> how do they unlock more character?
[3:41:40] <huskarl_zap> GOOD
[3:41:44] <Zayasu> thank god
[3:41:47] <%legacy0117> like*
[3:41:48] <NiktenKing> Don't spam autos unless you are Saf
[3:41:49] <+NekoNinja13> probably security things too @nekros4442 dont worry too much about it.
[3:41:51] <Manwad> It takes like only a couple runs to unlock everyone but shopkeeper. They're unlocked after you beat them on stag 3
[3:41:54] <+Aeoneth> kill her at >Stage 4
[3:41:55] <artificiallynatural> unlock characters by beating stage four bosses
[3:42:00] <%Typhaeon> Who's the Dan of this nuts game
[3:42:12] <huskarl_zap> As of it wasnt obvious characters didn't even have voices
[3:42:13] <%Nekros4442> @NekoNinja13 most of the security problems would only be on my side but I get why he doesnt want to
[3:42:15] <%legacy0117> But it was an RPG, with PVP player like this.
[3:42:17] <+Aeoneth> Probably Shopkeeper
[3:42:20] <+dmtjinni> F
[3:42:23] <%SirGO0SE> was nice of ya to offer nekros
[3:42:24] <%legacy0117> play*
[3:42:25] <FrostedZaibatsu> You bombed yourself
[3:42:45] <+dmtjinni> One thing I want to know..... Where is Minh???
[3:43:01] <%SirGO0SE> @dmtjinni reading dokapon wiki Kappa
[3:43:02] <+NekoNinja13> your eyes have to be on the whole screen!
[3:43:08] <+dmtjinni> LUL
[3:43:16] <artificiallynatural> keeps blowing himself up LUL. You're supposed to cast and immediately dash to drop it in enemy territory
[3:43:20] <+bigb00gi3> the trick is to use that bomb mid-melee, so you drop it on their field
[3:43:20] <Manwad> Need eyes on you, the tiles, on the inside...
[3:44:04] <%legacy0117> Brb. Gotta walk a dog.
[3:44:15] <%SomersaultJustice> JOHNS
[3:44:17] <TheyCallMeVawn> This is a battle network ass battle network game
[3:44:17] <%Grayhammatter> wha happun
[3:44:24] <+brudus_maximus> fraud detected
[3:44:24] <%Typhaeon> That's a DQ Kappa
[3:44:29] <NiktenKing> Kunai build
[3:44:39] <%Nekros4442> @SirGO0SE Yeah, sadly theres no easy way to share steam saves
[3:44:41] <gordieda20> DQ Kappa
[3:44:49] <%DukeBlack_> Battle Network Successor?
[3:45:06] <NiktenKing> GO SLASHFIK
[3:45:20] <stormhawk9891> @WoolieVersus Selicy's melee damage is based on frost stacks, so use your spells and stop spamming melee
[3:45:44] <Manwad> man if you could go full phantom dust with this and select themed loadouts, that'd be so rad
[3:45:44] <lotharrio> So this is Battle Network as a fighter?
[3:45:51] <+Dogbert24> ice girl melee sucks without frost
[3:45:58] <1matheuw> battle network is the shit
[3:46:01] <%Nekros4442> Melee costs 1 mana
[3:46:02] <artificiallynatural> yup. stack frost on and then cash in with the eattack
[3:46:07] <+bigb00gi3> is it possible to press X on the character select screens?
[3:46:08] <+pectusumbra> using your melee costs mana, that's why you have no meter
[3:46:09] <%Nekros4442> On selicy
[3:46:09] <OkamiDude15> It’s battle network but the battle mode as a bonus
[3:46:16] <Shardlab> Yes
[3:46:19] <FrostedZaibatsu> @lotharrio it has a "story" mode
[3:46:25] <spardanwarrior> It's Battle Network as a roguelike, with a bonus versus mode on the side
[3:46:30] <+Xero_J> The main game is a roguelike
[3:46:35] <kei_ar_> woolieGASM
[3:46:35] <1matheuw> is that motherfucker named shpkeeper?
[3:46:40] <%SirGO0SE> @manwad i have a copy of phantom dust within arms reach. ive never heard anyone bring up that game before this moment
[3:46:41] <lotharrio> Interesting
[3:46:45] <artificiallynatural> will you guys play through single-player at all?
[3:46:47] <OkamiDude15> It’s battle network meets slay the spyre(?)
[3:46:48] <%Nekros4442> Co-op would be interesting lol
[3:46:49] <Shardlab> use your spells, but your unique isn't something you want to spam endlessly
[3:46:51] <+Dogbert24> you can read the descriptions on their toolkit
[3:46:52] <%0rond> it's a shame they don't have violette, she is so freaking cool
[3:47:10] <Manwad> @SirGO0SE because it's too cool and weird. Also it's free on windows, everyone should play it.
[3:47:11] <+Aeoneth> Jesus Gunner Ditto
[3:47:18] <Shardlab> The vines root enemies in place
[3:47:34] <%SirGO0SE> it is?! oh shit. im going to play this shit out of it again
[3:47:41] <%SirGO0SE> fireball variety for days
[3:47:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> !uptime
[3:47:42] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 47 minutes
[3:47:52] <OkamiDude15> This game has mod support and people have added mega man and others being in the works
[3:47:56] <Manwad> It even has online that's not garbo
[3:47:56] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1260094696292048899
[3:48:01] <FrostedZaibatsu> I love MMBN and i have like 70~ hrs in this game. Looks like MMBN but they are very different
[3:48:18] <+pectusumbra> agreed
[3:48:26] <OkamiDude15> The gameplay takes some getting used to but it’s fun
[3:48:37] <1matheuw> the combo tho
[3:48:37] <%0rond> it's sort of taken the basic elements of BN and took it to the extreme end
[3:48:40] <+Aeoneth> THe person who lost the 1st round gets a slowly generating shield in the 2nd
[3:48:42] <Shardlab> There ya go
[3:48:43] <+NekoNinja13> this game is alot more loose than mmbn, and that not a bad thing, just different
[3:48:47] <+Xero_J> Little side note; Gunner deals slightly more damage when reloading
[3:48:48] <NiktenKing> SLASHFIK fight
[3:48:53] <+bigb00gi3> press X after you've selected a dude when you're on the co-op character select to get a better look at their kit
[3:48:55] <MegaQuint> Definitely a lot more to keep an eye on compared to BN
[3:49:08] <NiktenKing> Slashfik fights with Gunner are so weird
[3:49:22] <Arek_1> Are there AreaGrab/AreaSteal and essentially Navi chips in this game?
[3:49:37] <%legacy0117> GUN BATTLES.
[3:49:38] <%0rond> this game is a master class of UI/UX
[3:49:41] <+pectusumbra> there's no area grab and no navi type chips
[3:49:44] <Shardlab> No area stealing
[3:49:47] <%Grayhammatter> oh fuck
[3:49:51] <Shardlab> And no summons
[3:49:51] <OkamiDude15> There is time stop tho
[3:49:54] <1matheuw> hmmmm
[3:49:56] <%SirGO0SE> PogChamp
[3:49:57] <%0rond> oh please do it
[3:50:06] <BlacSoul> we hep
[3:50:08] <1matheuw> it enables chat to fuck you i bet
[3:50:09] <%preppyposs> WOOLIE NO
[3:50:10] <%0rond> let us help
[3:50:11] <%thespacerunaway> o shit
[3:50:11] <FrostedZaibatsu> The dev balanced this game a lot since release. It use to be why more brutal. Beat story mode in 30~ hrs
[3:50:12] <%FuqBoiSlim> Stream Integration?! PogChamp
[3:50:14] <%ChoculaUltra> ooo neat, stream integration
[3:50:15] <+Aeoneth> ohhh man

[3:50:23] <+Aeoneth> Let's GOOOOO
[3:50:24] <NiktenKing> Bosses have the ability to mercy you on near death
[3:50:28] <Thunderhog> So how streaming mode works is chat can vote on what upgrades they want you to pick up. you have FULL controll of your choices however so it hurts nothing

[4:02:12] <%optimasmaximas> Pat is SUPER excited to see it fall apart
[4:02:13] <KRaZyAmmo> Pat...playing smash? what madness is this lol
[4:02:17] <Zayasu> @WoolieVersus strive got delayed
[4:02:21] <+Ancopro> hes excited for the shitshow off smash online
[4:02:26] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Become as Red Bars
[4:02:26] <+Ancopro> i meanb we all are
[4:02:28] <%optimasmaximas> pat said he's gonna unplug his ethernet cable for it LUL
[4:02:31] <arkv01> red bar it up boyos
[4:02:33] <%0rond> does anyone follow achievement hunter? do they have anyone that actually knows fighting games or is it going to be a slaughter?
[4:02:40] <%legacy0117> When is PAT going to get back into IT?
[4:02:43] <%ekodrop> 2021
[4:02:46] <OkamiDude15> it aint done yet
[4:02:46] <%SirGO0SE> LOVE delays
[4:02:48] <%legacy0117> I gotta know.
[4:02:51] <%optimasmaximas> early 2021
[4:02:52] <%Damie904> Got delayed cause of covid
[4:02:52] <Shardlab> They got stuff to fix
[4:02:54] <%SomersaultJustice> smell of delays
[4:02:54] <%SirGO0SE> never release it
[4:02:57] <arkv01> who is/are achievement hunters? Find out tomorrow!
[4:02:57] <%Andrizzleton> get that code worked out bruh
[4:03:00] <DeathByPoke7> rollback to the oven
[4:03:05] <Camail> infinite delays = infinitely better
[4:03:06] <%optimasmaximas> boy that lobby system tho
[4:03:10] <DXLelouch24> REMOVE that lobby
[4:03:11] <+pectusumbra> Woolie, did you hear about the darkest dungeon PvP? Any plans to give it a shot on stream?
[4:03:11] <%0rond> they aren't going to change the lobbies. you know they won't
[4:03:16] <%omnicrescendo> delay indefinitely - make perfect game
[4:03:35] <+Aeoneth> prob more likely their polish velocity was impacted by Covid
[4:03:38] <%legacy0117> Cause Pat has become a rust monster I bet.
[4:03:42] <%TheJaydedFox> @0rond Matt is actually pretty decent at smash. Everyone else in AH is hot garbage
[4:03:43] <@Solidus_113> https://twitter.com/ArcSystemWorksU/status/1261129173575352323
[4:03:52] <%legacy0117> Needs oil and cleaning.
[4:03:57] <%ChoculaUltra> you think ArcSys would ever retroactively add rollback to like DBFZ and GBVS?
[4:03:59] <@Solidus_113> That delay is long enough to make a whole new lobby
[4:04:08] <OkamiDude15> new lobby, new ui, and sol's wild throw is now a pretzal motion super that does 100% of your life
[4:04:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> So how many seconds are we betting on from when the Achievement Hunter Smash event starts and when Pat screams that Smash sucks?
[4:04:25] <KRaZyAmmo> many fighting games!
[4:04:25] <DeathByPoke7> gg strive on ps5
[4:04:31] <%0rond> AH really seemed kinda surface level ever since ray left, but I hadn't followed them too deeply so iunno
[4:04:32] <%FuqBoiSlim> @choculaultra that's up to bandai and cygames if they want to do that
[4:04:35] <%SirGO0SE> we finally have time to study the blade

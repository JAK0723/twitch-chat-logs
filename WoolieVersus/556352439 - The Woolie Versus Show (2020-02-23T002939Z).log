[0:02:44] <BallerSwagBro9k> SUCH a good song
[0:02:47] <WG101> @flyinghobo mario party, but an RPG
[0:02:50] <bombasticwazoo> Pure rage distilled into a video game
[0:02:55] <+VLN_VS> It's like Mario Party, but someone usually ends up in cuffs
[0:03:01] <+Coolkevinator> do they realize this is even SALTIER Mario Party?
[0:03:09] <%RioGascar> Right right whats this?
[0:03:11] <%Solidnick18> PJSalt party woolieCHAN
[0:03:12] <INDECISIVEjew> yoooooo this fucking game
[0:03:17] <flyinghobo> @WG101 im even more confused!
[0:03:18] <%WornTrigger> WornTrigger subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[0:03:19] <+twig_blight> Woooooow! Woolie streaming, normally I'm at work
[0:03:27] <%Solidnick18> yooooooooo dokapon kingdom
[0:03:30] <%Solidnick18> Hell yeah
[0:03:31] <+soundcloud_raptor> oh man, great game. this must be for a salt party
[0:03:31] <+Coolkevinator> this game has committed several war crimes
[0:03:38] <%RioGascar> man...nintendos gonna have a fucking hard time following up mario odyssey
[0:03:39] <royb2> mario party but it ends up in manslaughter
[0:03:41] <kingkeldeo31> If you guys don't know about Dokapon and have time on your hands, check out the TRG's playthrough
[0:03:48] <WG101> @flyinghobo okay, imagine you and your friends are taking turns playing the same RPG
[0:03:59] <%RioGascar> like this song alone is fire as fuck
[0:04:03] <%FenixSeraph> FenixSeraph subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Just finished the last episode of your Death Stranding LP. Good shit my man, really appreciate seeing your thoughts on the ridiculous shit that happens in that game, and props to you guys for going through all of the emails like that.
[0:04:06] <Triplicat> i'm so ready for this
[0:04:09] <%Solidnick18> @kingkeldeo31 that's how i learned about it
[0:04:10] <INDECISIVEjew> you guys better do a full game. this deserves it
[0:04:16] <thatoneguynamedty> Yeyeye do the thing
[0:04:29] <+zombiedinosour> seeing the naruto fan art makes me want NNS so much more
[0:04:35] <XzileGaming> psaDab
[0:04:36] <flyinghobo> okay that makes more sense. @WG101 thanks
[0:04:54] <WG101> @flyinghobo now imagine your friends have to opportunity to fuck you over mid-RPG
[0:04:55] <INDECISIVEjew> This is the actual ultimate game for salt party.
[0:04:58] <korsablade> Oh no, we're entering the Dokapon purgatory arc
[0:05:07] <+marsantas> Time to watch a divorce happen in real time
[0:05:13] <+MachineMoronis> Dokapon Kingdom was made in a lab by the literal devil.
[0:05:14] <NuclearBut> woolie takes five years to stream dokapon, cause it's that long, and i'm so for it
[0:05:21] <%Solidnick18> This will test all of the salt levels
[0:05:23] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @BigNerdSam
[0:05:38] <clamlamity> Woolie's "I am my ancestor wildest dreams" selfie is still top 10 dopest pics he's taken of himself
[0:05:46] <%RioGascar> how did I manage to never heard of this apparently infamous game
[0:05:51] <+Coolkevinator> if any game tears these guys apart this is it
[0:05:57] <Triplicat> because it came out on the wii and the PS2
[0:05:57] <+MachineMoronis> Because it was buried for a reason like all great and ancient evils.
[0:05:59] <Triplicat> and that's it
[0:06:00] <+zombiedinosour> @clamlamity i can agree
[0:06:02] <BigNerdSam> OH LORD l JUST SAW WHAT WOOLlE IS STREAMlNG, THlS MAY END THE WOOLlE VS CREW
[0:06:05] <%RioGascar> its like how i somehow managed to know absolutely nothing about persona 5’s plot
[0:06:12] <+Cherororo> I'm so hype for this. I want a whole story mode playthrough.
[0:06:16] <INDECISIVEjew> please please please do the full story mode
[0:06:20] <+Cherororo> The end of friendships
[0:06:31] <Kouseo> i didnt realize we were killing friendship today
[0:06:37] <BigNerdSam> Will Minh's colorblindness be betrayed AGAIN?
[0:06:40] <%FenixSeraph> WoolieVersus (Final)
[0:06:42] <zenith0111> OMG YES DOKAPON
[0:06:42] <+Coolkevinator> a full story mode playthrough is literally dozens of hours
[0:06:53] <+MachineMoronis> Ya mean years.
[0:06:55] <%RioGascar> minhs color blindness will be exploited forever
[0:06:56] <islandoasis> oh lord
[0:07:03] <islandoasis> is this dokapon kingdom?
[0:07:05] <+Cherororo> Exactly! Let the salt reign for months.

[0:07:17] <islandoasis> this is the real freindship breaker
[0:07:17] <BigNerdSam> Salt emojis for ETERNITY
[0:07:19] <zenith0111> DOKAPON IS SALT CAPITOL
[0:07:22] <%FenixSeraph> "I hate to do this, but Minh, Reggie and I are no longer friends."
[0:07:30] <WG101> friendship at risk!
[0:07:32] <islandoasis> this fucking game man
[0:07:38] <@Moobot> That's a tad too many emotes, @BigNerdSam (warning)
[0:07:39] <INDECISIVEjew> Woolie I want you to know this game actually almost ended one of my friendships.
[0:07:49] <islandoasis> even on easy, the ai does some 10th level intellect bullshitr
[0:07:53] <INDECISIVEjew> we were legit mad at each other for weeks
[0:08:15] <%RioGascar> and considering minhs AS LONG AS YOU DONT WIN
[0:08:17] <%RioGascar> boy
[0:08:18] <+Cherororo> How long until Minh figures out that he can abuse the Darkling mechanics for maximum salt?
[0:08:29] <+MachineMoronis> Dokapon Kingdom! Because God is fake, the Devil is real, and hell awaits us all.
[0:08:30] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:08:30] <RandomDudeDave> This is gonna be a metropolis of salt

[0:09:08] <Antero_legion> this theme is rocking! and I never found out the name
[0:09:15] <kingkeldeo31> It's the game that never ends
[0:09:15] <viridianowl> I've seen the Runaway Guys LP on Dokapon and good god does it take a long time.
[0:09:19] <Antero_legion> all I know it as is "Woolie's credits theme2
[0:09:20] <islandoasis> i have been keeping one eye on woolie's party game videos just for this game
[0:09:27] <%RioGascar> i think its something little V did
[0:09:35] <%FenixSeraph> this song gets better once you get past the initial bit
[0:09:44] <+ValenMorrow> Pretty sure that Runaway Guys LP is the reason my brother wanted to find a copy of it
[0:09:50] <zenith0111> SourPls
[0:10:03] <Antero_legion> I like that it sounds like a "Final Score Screen" theme, still wish I knew the name

[0:15:03] <MyNameIsRasus> Ale P
[0:15:04] <+vestiphobe> @WoolieVersus take the time before playing to remove all sharp and dangerous objects from the play area
[0:15:10] <islandoasis> Deadly P

[0:15:39] <+OnlyNumber1> Welcome to the end of Woolie Versus
[0:15:43] <+BigBruthaThunda> I'm interested in your lack of interest
[0:15:44] <%kjsandwich> Cool Kirby Light
[0:15:52] <+therravinggamer> Woolie for your own sanity, do a practice round and then have a walkthrough if you ever play this again. Dokapon is MEAN
[0:15:54] <BallerSwagBro9k> @xzilegaming Who survives tonight?
[0:15:57] <BigNerdSam> Woolie should do a Gon in 60 Seconds for Twin Peaks.
[0:15:59] <%Prevot> I watched that LP and I didn't like the game OR the LP, don't @ me
[0:16:18] <damienlunas> The answer is "Kaaa chiiipu..."
[0:16:32] <MyNameIsRasus> And that's horrible
[0:16:32] <XzileGaming> @BallerSwagBro9k the video section, we'll always have the memories
[0:16:33] <%RioGascar> Its...not a good game
[0:16:39] <+zegoodknight> I love playing this game with friends xD
[0:16:45] <Laecerelius> What about the football murders?
[0:16:46] <%Solidnick18> it's a janky game
[0:16:51] <BallerSwagBro9k> So much Great Woolie Lore
[0:16:53] <zenith0111> I made my friends hate this game LUL
[0:17:01] <%commsquirrel> I love this game
[0:17:04] <+Nathillon> Oh this is gonna be good.
[0:17:13] <%kjsandwich> Great Cutscenes but you have A LOT of boring and terrible gameplay to sit through to get them.
[0:17:15] <%RioGascar> when minh was billy
[0:17:19] <+zegoodknight> Play as a team... or play like you're playing mario party xD
[0:17:20] <Dhurkst> @RioGascar Depends on what you're looking for from it. The writing is actually great.
[0:17:21] <BigNerdSam> Woolie the Liar Steals my Pie while Minh Falls Asleep Driving at 200 Miles Per Hour ASMR
[0:17:29] <+DrPoxx> Minh’s lore is that he isn’t real. He is a PTSD hallucination of Reggie and Woolie
[0:17:45] <%kjsandwich> With that said I’m so excited for DP2
[0:17:57] <islandoasis> billy blasting smash bros music when he should have been blasting Initial D music when driving
[0:18:02] <C24U> SOLID LORE
[0:18:02] <%RioGascar> So i played a lot lot more vr games that are not polished
[0:18:04] <%RioGascar> And boy
[0:18:12] <%RioGascar> not having comfort cages hurts me actually
[0:18:12] <RaidenKyrielight> It was Matt
[0:18:18] <+BigBruthaThunda> yeah, just a rumor, unlike the woolie hole
[0:18:22] <+Flambage> @WoolieVersus Are you going to tell us next that you CAN read?
[0:18:25] <XzileGaming> but you did steal alot of pies though, right
[0:18:31] <MyNameIsRasus> ...but you DID kill that guy, right?
[0:18:43] <ShmowzowKapow> the woolie hole
[0:18:43] <DracaenaLeaf> Woolie hole
[0:18:49] <+pkmamsters> Two Best Friends play was built on the idea of "The Ones Who Walk Away from Woolie"
[0:18:52] <@Solidus_113> It's like playing games during a long drive, you'll get carsick pretty quick if you just focus on the game
[0:18:52] <islandoasis> but you were best friends with liam in the office right?
[0:18:53] <C24U> Throw Woolie into the hole
[0:18:54] <+zegoodknight> The pie stealer
[0:18:54] <+theredherring1996> oh no
[0:18:55] <%Solidnick18> i miss the woolie hole
[0:19:01] <+theredherring1996> theredherring1996 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:19:01] <+SirGO0SE> psaWhat
[0:19:05] <Mvrdok_> LUL
[0:19:08] <%generalve> the hole woolieOMG woolieOMG woolieOMG
[0:19:08] <%Solidnick18> it was your apartment
[0:19:09] <damienlunas> Kind of both at once
[0:19:09] <BallerSwagBro9k> BOTH
[0:19:10] <eviljake9> "let's find a bus to throw woolie under"
[0:19:10] <Nekros4442> The Woolie hole is the deepest lore
[0:19:10] <%The_Timo> Little bit of both Lol
[0:19:11] <%RioGascar> I mean for the longest time I thought when pat talked he was matt and when matt talked he was pat
[0:19:12] <Electro96> all of the above
[0:19:15] <%kjsandwich> God bless the hole
[0:19:16] <Dhurkst> @WoolieVersus DP is legitimately a very polarizing game, that's fine.
[0:19:19] <D00D64> the nebulous zone of which Woolie occurs
[0:19:19] <XzileGaming> psaSmug psaSmug psaSmug
[0:19:21] <+OnlyNumber1> @WoolieVersus Who's gonna throw the first punch tonight?
[0:19:21] <+BigBruthaThunda> IT was the woolie hole in the abstract
[0:19:33] <%The_Timo> I'm sure the Woolie hole lies beneath those trashbags in the intro
[0:19:34] <@Solidus_113> It's not a good game
[0:19:37] <+therravinggamer> @WoolieVersus dont play games you dont feel you will enjoy, play what makes you happy
[0:19:47] <LeaIsChill> It's a bad game and a bad thing to play. It's just THAT kind of game
[0:19:56] <zenith0111> You're not missing anything unless you're apart of the niche
[0:19:57] <%RioGascar> its not, sure the writing might be fun. But as game. Bad
[0:20:09] <%Solidnick18> we good
[0:20:17] <+vestiphobe> yall saying play what makes you happy but then these dudes about to play dokapon kingdom
[0:20:27] <+BigBruthaThunda> DID HE SAY CONNECTION
[0:20:40] <%Wool> bruh this stream is gonna be absolutely hilarious or absolute shit
[0:20:48] <snowmanie> oh right, Mystery Box was a thing
[0:20:48] <@Solidus_113> It was a mcdonalds pie that he won fairly
[0:20:51] <%Wool> there's no in between for Dokapon
[0:20:54] <+Coolkevinator> my favorite mystery box is still animorphs
[0:21:00] <speximillian> Woolie no you fool
[0:21:01] <+Coolkevinator> skittles is a close second
[0:21:01] <MyNameIsRasus> Three year old cheesecake, for instance
[0:21:08] <speximillian> This is the ultimate salt party game
[0:21:24] <%theredherring1996> who's idea was it to play this

[0:21:52] <XzileGaming> this sounds like blatant lying
[0:21:53] <DracaenaLeaf> THIEF

[0:31:19] <+Coolkevinator> good fucking luck doing that these days
[0:31:50] <+Xeno351> shows are also generally much better so you don't have like 3 good ones a season
[0:31:51] <eviljake9> I'm five years into college when the fuck does this time happen?

[0:32:02] <+pkmamsters> Woolie calls out Anitubers
[0:32:07] <+Coolkevinator> you have to curate a lot of the trash
[0:32:08] <%RioGascar> Its impossible to watch everything of one medium
[0:32:12] <C24U> I thought Eyepatch Wolf only watched Hunter X Hunter
[0:32:13] <%RioGascar> Its just impossible
[0:32:23] <+tearknack> @WoolieVersus Jedd used to, emphasis on used to, have a show where he literally did that - reviewed every new show of the season
[0:32:24] <zenith0111> @dhurkst That's how someone who loved it described it XD
[0:32:27] <+tearknack> jeff

[0:34:14] <Nekros4442> Just gonna say. Your bits in Gon in 60 Seconds are getting fucking amazing dude
[0:34:25] <Dhurkst> @zenith0111 It's the last way I would describe it. It's more chill, relaxing, cute stuff in a super-cool fantasy world
[0:34:41] <LeaIsChill> pls do fan expo this year in toronto
[0:34:47] <islandoasis> waitng for eyepatch wolf to kick the door down and turn this into a 4 player dokapon session

[0:36:39] <OldManDeckardCain> as long as you guys don't include an AI this will be fun
[0:36:40] <+Jhylla81> Oh god. Dokapon Kingdom? I thin someone is gonna get murdered. This game isn't just a friendship ender. It's a life ender.

[0:36:54] <%FenixSeraph> salt genre
[0:36:54] <speximillian> So this game is a game of Mario Party without minigames, but the length of a jRPG?
[0:36:55] <+Zereaux> yo minh rockin that undercut
[0:36:56] <$jobbedbone> are all the jobs and stuff unlocked?
[0:36:56] <+ValenMorrow> It B E G I N S
[0:36:59] <OldManDeckardCain> AI in this game is pure BS
[0:37:03] <LeaIsChill> @Deadmanslegacy RPG Mario Party + Salt
[0:37:04] <+vestiphobe> @Deadmanslegacy it's mario party but turned to 11 multiple times
[0:37:05] <D00D64> given that this is a multiplayer RPG with woolie, be prepared for this to be Part 1 of 234
[0:37:08] <+therravinggamer> @Deadmanslegacy a game with more salt than any mario party in existence
[0:37:08] <MyNameIsRasus> Minh looking minh t FRESH
[0:37:09] <%averyoddjew> mario party meets monopoly
[0:37:13] <%jiggy_snipe> well I'm excited for some PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[0:37:14] <nin10play> @Deadmanslegacy Think Mario Party, but you can actively fuck other people by running into them
[0:37:15] <+SirGO0SE> M(inh)VP
[0:37:18] <Hellarussian> is Dokapon more brutal than Mario Party?
[0:37:18] <Deadmanslegacy> @fenixseraph "salt genre", 😂😂😂
[0:37:20] <%Solidnick18> here we go
[0:37:26] <zenith0111> @dhurkst He did read the Manga tho but I doubt it's that different
[0:37:28] <speximillian> Gonna be longer than the W101 playthrough
[0:37:33] <sonicblade38> @Hellarussian yes
[0:37:34] <+vestiphobe> @Hellarussian many tims more brutal
[0:37:43] <Hellarussian> oh no
[0:37:50] <Deadmanslegacy> @nin10play lul
[0:37:51] <GeltonZ> @Deadmanslegacy It's often called "The Friendship Ending Game". It is a full length RPG in board game format. A game lasts 40 hours.
[0:37:59] <a_mad_dragon> no sound?
[0:37:59] <+Jhylla81> Dokapon Kingdom is the Dark Souls of Party games
[0:38:04] <+therravinggamer> 40 hours minimum @GeltonZ
[0:38:11] <Deadmanslegacy> 😂😂😂 good to know
[0:38:12] <zenith0111> YE YE YE YE
[0:38:15] <%Solidnick18> Tense?
[0:38:19] <%Wool> YEYEYEYE
[0:38:20] <Dhurkst> Here we go!
[0:38:20] <+Coolkevinator> IT IS NOT
[0:38:21] <+marsantas> no
[0:38:22] <WG101> no it's not
[0:38:22] <OldManDeckardCain> there's a battle mode that's shorter
[0:38:26] <%Solidnick18> This what the people wanted
[0:38:31] <nin10play> Friendships will no overcome Dokapon
[0:38:31] <%RioGascar> Huh atlus
[0:38:31] <%Wool> Minh is gonna fucking get banned from the house
[0:38:32] <Deadmanslegacy> nice Simpson's opening
[0:38:32] <jubejube56> Somebody get the bodybags ready
[0:38:33] <+KENTASHIRO> No friends here, just Minh
[0:38:37] <zenith0111> MY BODY IS READY
[0:38:41] <Redblood801> Will this game end the channel?
[0:38:41] <D00D64> wait, Sting? They made that strategy game with the bullet dodge mechanics?
[0:38:43] <%Solidnick18> SourPls
[0:38:44] <+Aztec50> Is this a salt party?
[0:38:44] <Triplicat> 💦
[0:38:45] <WG101> within the realm of dokapon's divinity
[0:38:45] <%RioGascar> IT IS BUSINESS HERE
[0:38:46] <+SirGO0SE> this game is tight
[0:38:48] <kingkeldeo31> War never changes
[0:38:51] <%Solidnick18> This is big salt party
[0:38:51] <zayasu> WoolieVersus (FINAL)
[0:38:51] <eusclid> love this game
[0:38:57] <eviljake9> oh I remember this game now. Someone might get stabbed.
[0:38:57] <%RioGascar> Business salt
[0:39:04] <%RioGascar> Corporate salt
[0:39:16] <Darren716> They doing the full game?
[0:39:16] <+Aztec50> oh my
[0:39:19] <+therravinggamer> it took The Runaway Guys years to beat this
[0:39:26] <+therravinggamer> and there was GENUINE anger at times
[0:39:28] <+KENTASHIRO> Losing isn't winning in Dokapon like it is in Mario
[0:39:30] <GeltonZ> This is less Mario Party and more RPG in board game format.
[0:39:31] <+Coolkevinator> YUP
[0:39:37] <OldManDeckardCain> you can force other players to have poop as hair if you kill them
[0:39:38] <+FadingEmber> Stonks will be had
[0:39:39] <GarbageNirvana> I saw Game Grumps play it once, it looked infuriating
[0:39:40] <townzzzzz> who will use the Behelit first
[0:39:41] <zenith0111> STARTO
[0:39:42] <OldManDeckardCain> or change their name lol

[0:39:44] <Triplicat> STONKS
[0:39:47] <zenith0111> HYPE HYPE HYPE
[0:39:48] <GaimDS> Isn't this the game that can go on FOREVER?
[0:39:54] <Redblood801> I can't believe Woolie wants to end the channel this soon
[0:39:57] <speximillian> This game doesn’t have a comeback factor like Mario Party
[0:39:59] <sonicblade38> this game ALSO has hidden classes kuz why NOT
[0:39:59] <D00D64> Get ready to see some progress RISE and FALL
[0:40:00] <GeltonZ> @GaimDS It is a full length RPG
[0:40:02] <+vestiphobe> Hahahahah STONKS
[0:40:03] <+l33t_j4gu4r> time to buy some French fries. so much salt

[0:49:25] <%Solidnick18> oh god
[0:49:32] <nin10play> @TheGamerMaldito No teams unless they agree to work together. Red is girl character, Blue is boy character
[0:49:35] <zayasu> minh is the rock
[0:49:35] <%jiggy_snipe> Woolie is Kevin Hart
[0:49:36] <Redblood801> What could possibly go wrong?

[0:49:56] <crossing_mao> “Don’t worry about it” Joe flashback intensifies
[0:50:08] <autcetera> when I try to roll my R it sounds like a Japanese R
[0:50:09] <DXLelouch24> So 21 turns
[0:50:12] <+Goku01899> Dokapon kingdom can last a long time. It’s super funny with friends though.
[0:50:20] <YakumoYomi> Time for some Dokapon brand sodium.
[0:50:20] <GeltonZ> Don't worry about timing. All of the rolls are determined before the game starts so you can't save scum.

[0:52:36] <Triplicat> it shows you the button anyway
[0:52:43] <GeltonZ> Uh oh. That's VERY bad.
[0:52:58] <GeltonZ> Basically Minh can't play as his buttons do not match the actions.
[0:52:59] <%RioGascar> Is this literally
[0:53:06] <%RioGascar> 1 turn of combat
[0:53:07] <islandoasis> minh dropping into a lvl 6 fight at lvl 1
[0:53:09] <%RioGascar> Per turn
[0:53:13] <Make_me_mad> Messing up the controls to give himself a better start? Classic Woolie.
[0:53:14] <%jiggy_snipe> I don't think any of their buttons match
[0:53:17] <Redblood801> Woolie has already sabotage Minh
[0:53:22] <+marsantas> Stream over!

[0:55:11] <Dhurkst> @RioGascar I'm sure it was pointed out, but that's where a lot of the salt comes from. XD

[0:55:33] <Hellarussian> sadness continuation
[0:55:37] <%RioGascar> Fgc rap seems like a genre that is under utilized
[0:55:47] <nin10play> @RioGascar I don't necessarily see how it's a bad idea, the point of the game is kinda to backstab your other players so 1 battle action per turn makes it so that you can beat them when they are weakened by others for your own benfit
[0:55:50] <RTM771993> fuk chat ??? LUL

[1:00:39] <%RioGascar> @dhurkst My issue is how it just puts good rpgs pacing to halt. sometimes the combat is fun, but a lot of it turns into min maxing and breaking the game in half
[1:00:59] <nin10play> @Hammatime8 Yup. Need to use an antidote, visit a church or the castle
[1:01:07] <%Prevot> totally simple and not confusing at all

[2:06:32] <42nfl19> we saw the only thing that matters...THE TRUE RESULTS
[2:06:33] <@Solidus_113> Inject a weed
[2:06:34] <CalderGaming> it's a meme
[2:06:36] <redrins> a needle you use to inject weed
[2:06:37] <+powercrasher2> On eBay
[2:06:37] <King_Wolf_Rigger> only the hardest weed needle
[2:06:37] <Tooniearcade> sipsipHonk
[2:06:39] <%spiritofmojave> it's not real?
[2:06:39] <%GinAndRoses> it's how you inject your weed'
[2:06:41] <SomeSageAdvice> remember the Weed Podcast
[2:06:42] <%spiritofmojave> I think
[2:06:42] <%CJett92> its used to inject your weeds
[2:06:42] <+PhillipChanter> didn't pat mention the weed needle?
[2:06:44] <$Noponiz> A WEEDLE?
[2:06:44] <zmuno> woolieGASM_TK
[2:06:45] <redrins> not with that attitude reg
[2:06:45] <Tooniearcade> sipsipDab
[2:06:46] <Katorskay> you CAN
[2:06:46] <heartlesshealer> you can, but you'd die
[2:06:47] <Laecerelius> Gotta inject that weed
[2:06:48] <%Wool> you guys literally talked about injecting weed on the podcast
[2:06:49] <%Solidnick18> inject the weeds
[2:06:51] <+Luthwag> sbfpPatschwitz
[2:06:53] <+JackMillerTime> you can get a concentrate
[2:06:53] <CalderGaming> wait it's NOT a meme?!
[2:06:54] <+ArcanumMBD> The weed needle is for injecting the marijuana
[2:06:56] <popcultureaficionado> you talked about it on the podcast
[2:06:57] <zenith0111> YOU DON'T SHOOT YOURSELF UP
[2:06:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> someone doesn't watch the podcast
[2:06:58] <TigerClaws12> WutFace
[2:06:58] <SomeSageAdvice> you actually talked about it on the Podcast
[2:06:59] <bear_breaker20> 'needles of weed"
[2:07:00] <goose_attack_almanac> Don't worry, we all got to see that Reggie's worth as an adventurer was not worth the investment.
[2:07:03] <+EternalJedi> syringe =/= needlke
[2:07:04] <heartlesshealer> YES
[2:07:04] <+eanscrale> It is a meme, but it is real for some reason
[2:07:06] <heartlesshealer> WE ALL SAW
[2:07:06] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Put it in your balls
[2:07:07] <redrins> THC straight into the eyeballs

[2:07:12] <MahjongNucleus> @WoolieVersus that's Rick Simpson Oil, you don't inject it, it's topical.
[2:07:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> I GOT THE CLIP
[2:07:13] <zmuno> woolieGASM_TK woolieGASM_TK woolieGASM_TK woolieGASM_TK
[2:07:13] <islandoasis> the poop award
[2:07:13] <Ciglossonjr> "What is a weed needle", proceeds to explain what a weed needle is
[2:07:16] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I saw it.
[2:07:17] <eviljake9> it's mostly a joke about old anti-weed propaganda
[2:07:18] <%spiritofmojave> EQUAL TO POOP is a title I want
[2:07:19] <LoneFonte> reggie = poop
[2:07:19] <+BigBruthaThunda> "I've never heard of this, but let me tell you about it"
[2:07:20] <+EternalJedi> needles are needles, syringe is the part that holds the stuff
[2:07:21] <Zedimonx5> A weedle Jebaited
[2:07:26] <Dhurkst> weed needle: weedle
[2:07:31] <goose_attack_almanac> Coulda been worse
[2:07:32] <%Ecchigun> what we playin?
[2:07:32] <+SirGO0SE> Kappa500 Hypothetically speaking - Stockings, thigh highs, sandals, or bare?
[2:07:34] <+TheGamerMaldito> Yeah, syringes are not needles!
[2:07:36] <+Jhylla81> Only way Reggie being the poop would be even funnier is if he had the poop haircut
[2:07:38] <lotharrio> Weed needle is based on shit Pat said like 8 years ago, about "injecting a weed."

[3:46:37] <%CaptainPileDriver> WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE/
[3:46:38] <+freezydude> @RioGascar it would've been better to just do story mode instead of starting everyone at 30
[3:46:38] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Racism is too powerful to defeat

[3:48:10] <+Jhylla81> The true salt was from bordom
[3:48:12] <heartlesshealer> story mode is better than kill count
[3:48:13] <%StaceMcGate> @WoolieVersus might of been better at lvl 1
[3:48:16] <hntronium> THE RACIST REIGNS SUPREME
[3:48:18] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Racism always wins...
[3:48:19] <heartlesshealer> but yeah, magic's gone tonight
[3:48:21] <AutolycusLive> Story is outright the most entertaining mode. And more focused as a learning experience
[3:48:22] <gade177> What a JRPG where you have to grind? No way!
[3:48:23] <LoneFonte> i guess its time for the FULL LP
[3:48:24] <%yeknomlive> that's the problem with battle royale is the whole map is open. story mode paces it per zone
[3:48:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> reggie's twitter is still cursed and the best pop-offs are there too
[3:48:31] <4skore> RACISM WINS AGAIN
[3:48:32] <Magick_Man> @WoolieVersus Story mode is best mode.
[3:48:33] <%yeknomlive> and has objectives
[3:48:42] <islandoasis> you actiavely avoided the recommended mode you idoits
[3:48:45] <crossing_mao> FULL LP
[3:48:46] <Triplicat> i swear to god if that killed woolie's interest in the game NotLikeThis
[3:48:50] <gordieda20> Story had Actual objectives
[3:48:52] <SolquidSnake> Story is absolutley the way to go
[3:48:57] <%RioGascar> story mode sounds like a bad idea
[3:48:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> no
[3:49:00] <+KENTASHIRO> It's the right call Woolz
[3:49:01] <damienlunas> NO COWARDICE HERE
[3:49:01] <SheefEatsBeef> nah that game mode sucks balls
[3:49:01] <%CaptainPileDriver> smart decision
[3:49:01] <%RioGascar> Cause its not a lp
[3:49:03] <%StaceMcGate> @WoolieVersus the game is fun, but races are not well suited to LP
[3:49:03] <MyNameIsRasus> NOT COWARDS
[3:49:04] <lotharrio> Woolie rolled over and let the Racist won.
[3:49:06] <Darren716> Coward for not doing storymode

[3:54:53] <islandoasis> im salty that they managed to fuck up dokapon kingdom
[3:55:02] <%CaptainPileDriver> diebuster is terrible
[3:55:06] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Diebuster and Gunbuster are SO good.
[3:55:07] <+PerrinIsDead> How is Woolies chat worse than Pats?
[3:55:08] <Laveyrin> doodGood
[3:55:11] <mobius_won> Die buster is pretty great
[3:55:13] <redrins> diebuster IS great
[3:55:17] <am_omega> I am good with just Gunbuster.
[3:55:19] <mobius_won> Not as good as gunbuster but good
[3:55:21] <%wolfofsound> @PerrinIsDead I'm in both though LUL
[3:55:23] <+tearknack> oooh ah ooh ooh, ah ah aha ah ah
[3:55:33] <+tearknack> like the jazzy op
[3:55:39] <am_omega> GIANT ROBO: The day that stood still though is the best.
[3:55:46] <+RealPT1> I like Diebuster but feels a little mismatched next to Gunbuster
[3:55:53] <King_Wolf_Rigger> That creepy coach stuff was WEIRD
[3:55:54] <Zaphire_Saucypants> At this point, I think chat is just representative of the people chat watches.
[3:56:08] <@Solidus_113> the original cross-arm pose
[3:56:11] <redrins> diebuster is just far future gunbuster
[3:56:13] <am_omega> GIANT ROBO OVA THO
[3:56:15] <Lenmutt> so just chillin n chattin?
[3:56:21] <NaturalGear> People who hate on Diebuster because of Gunbuster are like people who hate DS2 because of DS1
[3:56:34] <mobius_won> Final episode from both is godlike
[3:56:44] <Mvrdok_> SamFlam
[3:57:04] <@Solidus_113> samurai jack
[3:57:09] <heartlesshealer> G Gundam?
[3:57:10] <lemon_lore> got?
[3:57:21] <Mvrdok_> Star Wars Kappa
[3:57:25] <heartlesshealer> oh the negative ones
[3:57:28] <@Menitta> Thats The Matrix for me
[3:57:28] <%Tearonex> Samurai Jack STILL bums me out
[3:57:33] <heartlesshealer> battlestar galactica
[3:57:42] <%jiggy_snipe> feelslike a waste of time
[3:57:42] <%wolfofsound> @WoolieVersus it's like having good sex then she shits all over your dick
[3:57:43] <+ValenMorrow> Endings are hard to write apparently
[3:57:44] <hntronium> The Guardian got done dirty in the end
[3:57:48] <Lenmutt> what is samurai world tho?
[3:57:48] <+balouie> STILL
[3:57:50] <am_omega> Yo don't talk shit about G Gundam. The ending was great.
[3:57:52] <+tearknack> the star of the new samurai jack was so cool
[3:57:58] <lotharrio> Guardian got done dirty too much.
[3:57:59] <spoopy24> narcos mexico is pretty good :o
[3:57:59] <hntronium> Where's my old king jack
[3:58:00] <+balouie> still angry with how chuck ended
[3:58:01] <gade177> The Matrix is overrated. Also Jessica Jones Season 1 ending was terrible.
[3:58:07] <heartlesshealer> @am_omega I thought we were talking about the great ones when I said that
[3:58:13] <GeltonZ> G Gundam's ending is AMAZING. Best ending ever is GoDannar.
[3:58:17] <BreakersAweigh> samurai jack did kind of end on a fart unfortunately
[3:58:25] <am_omega> Okay.
[3:58:30] <NaturalGear> Jessica Jones S1 is basically JoJo Part 4
[3:58:31] <+marsantas> Never forget battlestar galactica
[3:58:34] <+tearknack> the start of
[3:58:37] <lotharrio> Ending of How I Met Your Mother taints the entire show.
[3:58:39] <Zaphire_Saucypants> speaking of endings...
[3:58:40] <+revrendike> I'd rather have a bad ending than no ending.
[3:59:17] <Darren716> I hope you guys try a longer normal Dokkapon game again
[3:59:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> @revrendike i would not
[3:59:41] <RyuuAoi> Is it over?
[3:59:51] <gade177> Almost.
[3:59:52] <%wolfofsound> I'd rather gut's just ends being on the island then a bad ending
[3:59:54] <neraren> Are there any that you think are good games that made for bad videos?
[4:00:16] <redrins> how tho, trackmania is the shit
[4:00:17] <arkv01> RRLEASE IT COWARDS
[4:00:21] <zenith0111> What Trackmania went no where? That game is so much fun
[4:00:34] <SuperKirby24> whaaaat trackmania?
[4:00:36] <%RioGascar> fun for 1 playwr
[4:00:42] <+revrendike> @CaptainPileDriver No ending for Symbiotic Titan is criminal.
[4:00:42] <%wolfofsound> oof ye
[4:00:43] <heartlesshealer> there are absolutely good games that aren't great to "just watch"
[4:00:43] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:00:44] <%RioGascar> not for multiplayer
[4:00:45] <arkv01> psychonauts was fun
[4:00:48] <+Estuko> FeelsBadMan
[4:00:59] <%CaptainPileDriver> @revrendike yeah, but if that show botched the ending, how much more painful
[4:01:05] <gade177> Oh yeah I remember that.
[4:01:06] <zenith0111> :(
[4:01:13] <@Solidus_113> and then you started KH
[4:01:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> but it was so good
[4:01:18] <hntronium> Oh yeah I remember Matt really not feeling psychonauts
[4:01:20] <Zebroneath> Shame, but it is what it is
[4:01:27] <MayorRev> KH letsplays kill channels
[4:01:29] <arkv01> @Solidus_113 too soon ScaredyCat
[4:01:32] <heartlesshealer> Matt kinda wasn't into a lot of things
[4:01:33] <%CaptainPileDriver> why not you play it psychonauts woolie
[4:01:34] <redrins> honestly at that point in the channels life what was matt feeling
[4:01:43] <gade177> I don't get why Matt didn't like Psychonauts.
[4:01:43] <+Cherororo> Ah man, I was so hype for the Psychonauts playthrough, but what can you do.
[4:01:45] <+Dr_DangerPhD> There's so much stuff in psychonauts you can miss by not exploring the camp
[4:01:46] <+JD_Lars> Diebuster was fine. There’s way more egregious sequels out there.
[4:01:48] <BreakersAweigh> lmao solidus....
[4:01:52] <%Javaa01> If you wanna do Trackmania right, do a community night on PC on a public server, just not in Turbo, that game has bad community features
[4:01:52] <Rangenade> Sometimes your not in the mood for a game even though its good
[4:01:58] <arkv01> you will never compile the KH LP because it's in limbo... unless?
[4:02:02] <am_omega> It was like around that time when Matt was just not feeling things.
[4:02:07] <zenith0111> Because it didn't have boobs or crass jokes.

[4:10:00] <californaya> it's less budget and more a different art style
[4:10:07] <californaya> Issac has TONS of content
[4:10:31] <+linSP> looking forward to that last for real isaac update
[4:10:42] <+dmtjinni> BibleThump
[4:10:45] <Darren716> Still the whole presentation is more impressive than isaac or meatboy
[4:10:57] <+gantz_zero> meatboy looked waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay better
[4:10:58] <GenericTwitchAcc1> haha doo doo
[4:11:15] <+linSP> pee pee combo
[4:11:26] <californaya> yeah, this is just 3D, pretty basic, all things considering
[4:12:47] <%RioGascar> the cardboard looking just like cardboard but say...not decorated makes it look generic
[4:12:47] <+revrendike> A coin, viscera spells. This is basically The Adventures of Kissoon in the land of Everville.
[4:12:51] <+Estuko> @californaya I like it a lot, because it mostly appeals to my love for Paper Mario style world lol
[4:13:15] <%RioGascar> now if the walls get decorated or colored and changed then neat. But just cardboard flat looks...sorta lane
[4:13:18] <%RioGascar> *lame
[4:13:56] <zenith0111> I hope the actual game looks better than that tutorial
[4:14:05] <quasiplaying> @WoolieVersus Hey Woolie how's your night going?
[4:14:08] <MayorRev> butt
[4:14:26] <+gantz_zero> seems kind of ironic how popular this has gotten just after the era of "broooooown"
[4:14:41] <%RioGascar> Alright yeah the walls do look pretty nice
[4:14:46] <quasiplaying> !uptime
[4:14:46] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 14 minutes
[4:14:50] <%RioGascar> environments are cool looking
[4:14:50] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:15:26] <gade177> Oh so this is just turn based? "sigh".
[4:15:35] <+Shen2> That's cool, it's pretty much a puzzle game meets RPG
[4:16:03] <+gantz_zero> well, every puzzle movement is a turn @gade177
[4:16:10] <rubbishbinge> when's puzzles and dragons
[4:16:23] <+SirGO0SE> the cardboard aesthetic is great
[4:16:35] <%RioGascar> Im getting reminders of that OLD pitch for castle crashers
[4:16:43] <%RioGascar> where it was actually supposed to be cardboard
[4:17:08] <bevyrage> woolie missing a double attack on the previous board
[4:17:15] <zenith0111> Is Binding of issac by Behemoth?
[4:17:26] <+gantz_zero> no
[4:17:29] <+gantz_zero> definitely not
[4:18:08] <+gantz_zero> the publisher is literally listed as Edmund McMillen
[4:18:16] <%trustycoyote> Reminds me of Yoshis Cookie and Puzzle Quest
[4:18:16] <+gantz_zero> along with the developer
[4:18:24] <+SirGO0SE> been awhile since ive seen some yoshi cookie
[4:18:27] <%SomersaultJustice> warios woods is my fave
[4:18:29] <%yeknomlive> pokemon puzzle league was fun
[4:18:30] <zenith0111> @gantz_zero As suppose to metaphorically. Alright that makes sense then
[4:18:35] <%RioGascar> But the studio is behemoth i think
[4:18:39] <+Advenae7> puzzle and dragons crossover with mario on 3ds was good
[4:18:48] <%RioGascar> wait no thars super meatboys devs
[4:19:06] <+gantz_zero> the implication was that it wasn't even behind a company name @zenith0111
[4:19:20] <+revrendike> Anyone remember Gryomancer?
[4:19:20] <%yeknomlive> i had the game but no super scope
[4:19:24] <$afronooch> Steam page for Bum bo says Edmund Mcmillan and James Interactive iirc
[4:19:32] <GeltonZ> @revrendike I do! Barely.
[4:19:36] <quasiplaying> @Puzzle Fighter I think but I could be wrong
[4:19:43] <zenith0111> @gantz_zero You don't need to imply it. I mean you directly said it
[4:19:45] <MayorRev> ohhh neat
[4:19:48] <GarbageNirvana> I think she's always been Peach in Japan
[4:19:49] <quasiplaying> @WoolieVersus Puzzle fighter I think
[4:19:50] <%SomersaultJustice> it's the first western game
[4:19:50] <$Punisher7771> bumbo want coin
[4:19:54] <SoySocks> remember yoshi topsy turvy which was the gba game with the gyro in it for tilting gameplay?
[4:19:57] <+SirGO0SE> oh man Puzzle Fighter would be a real good one off
[4:19:57] <GarbageNirvana> It would be the first time we've seen it though
[4:20:03] <MayorRev> This gonna be a one-off i assume
[4:20:30] <quasiplaying> @WoolieVersus You should play Puzzle Fighter if you haven't
[4:20:38] <MayorRev> unless Woolie has a special Puzzle genre for his vids
[4:20:42] <+subwayterry> @SoySocks that was more of a fever dream than a game, what a strange concept
[4:20:45] <MayorRev> Get Into Puzzle Games
[4:21:01] <MayorRev> <o/
[4:21:08] <%RioGascar> it is a pretty interesting combat system
[4:21:22] <%Ecchigun> BOMBO?
[4:21:32] <SoySocks> @subwayterry I borrowed it from a friend and played it through in a day, and i still don't know if i like it or not
[4:21:34] <MayorRev> duumbo?
[4:21:43] <MayorRev> Boom Bow
[4:21:49] <segbas2004> bumbo...

[4:22:22] <hntronium> I love Bubu Chacha
[4:22:34] <segbas2004> if anyone cares: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtgKoi2MzUU
[4:23:02] <californaya> oh, that car hatches from an egg, I don't like that
[4:23:11] <+Shen2> This game looks like something I may enjoy
[4:23:43] <+Advenae7> dragon ball, la quête finale ; des 7 boules de cristales venues des étoiles lynkaHein
[4:23:46] <quasiplaying> @WoolieVersus Hey Woolie have you played Honkai Impact 3rd?
[4:23:47] <segbas2004> @WoolieVersus Are you aware of the awful qweeb dub of dragon ball?
[4:24:09] <+Estuko> @quasiplaying haven't played that in a good while, I stopped playing for a bit NotLikeThis opera omnia has me atm
[4:24:11] <+gantz_zero> eggs or gachapon?
[4:24:16] <0rond> you should try setting up some bigger combo's over more turns
[4:24:30] <+Shen2> @WoolieVersus It's "genius of the turtles" in italian.
[4:24:40] <+revrendike> a magic car that hatches from an egg and wins races by sniffing nitrous flowers.
[4:24:56] <californaya> so this is in the Issac Cinematic Universe?
[4:24:58] <quasiplaying> @Estuko Dude you should get back into it, fuckign events now are cerazy lol
[4:25:18] <0rond> this is 100% part of the isaac MCU, you get some BIG LORE in some of the later endings
[4:25:35] <californaya> He's been working on Mewgenics forever
[4:25:38] <SoySocks> @WoolieVersus you talking about the Four Souls card game?
[4:25:39] <californaya> it's still in development :v
[4:25:39] <Triplicat> the isaac marvel cinematic universe?
[4:25:42] <serpenttucker> There we a LOT of games that came before isaac
[4:25:46] <Darren716> Is it the one with Rich Evans?
[4:25:48] <quasiplaying> @Estuko How far in the story did you get through?
[4:25:49] <serpenttucker> from edmund
[4:25:51] <Jack_of_No_Trades> battle block?
[4:25:52] <LoneFonte> end is nigh?
[4:25:52] <SoySocks> oh yeah the rich evans one
[4:25:53] <0rond> isaac meatboy cinematic universe
[4:25:53] <+linSP> the end is nigh?
[4:25:59] <%RioGascar> Gish?
[4:25:59] <Darren716> Yes end is nigh
[4:26:00] <$afronooch> the end is nigh?
[4:26:05] <SoySocks> @Jack_of_No_Trades battleblock is The Behemoth, not Ed McMillin
[4:26:07] <+Estuko> @quasiplaying really? NotLikeThis we just got aranea from FF15 in dissidia and she's really cool too, lol. I probably stopped at... god it was some snowy area I think
[4:26:09] <0rond> end is nigh was pretty meh
[4:26:09] <californaya> oh, I completely forgot about that
[4:26:15] <0rond> didn't scratch that meatboy itch
[4:26:17] <SoySocks> It's a platformer
[4:26:19] <+linSP> end is nigh is great platformer
[4:26:26] <Jack_of_No_Trades> @SoySocks Oh yes thanks! Getting late lol
[4:26:32] <Darren716> Its a platformer and rich evans simulator
[4:26:46] <quasiplaying> @Estuko Chapter? But like how much do you know so far?
[4:26:46] <segbas2004> isn't it even harder than smb&
[4:26:58] <@Solidus_113> N+
[4:26:58] <serpenttucker> Woolie sleeping on these 5/6/7 part combos
[4:27:06] <0rond> EiN felt worse than meatboy
[4:27:08] <+gantz_zero> you wanna be that guy.....
[4:27:09] <californaya> You Wanna Be That Guy LUL
[4:27:12] <+JackMillerTime> hell yeah
[4:27:18] <arkv01> I wanna be de guy has always beeb insane
[4:27:31] <+gantz_zero> i'd like to be that person
[4:27:37] <BadgerDK> any of you played the best platformer Dustforce?
[4:27:38] <SuperKirby24> you wanna be that guy LUL
[4:27:39] <+Estuko> @quasiplaying I do not remember, when I said a while I mean a fucking good while lmao. Uhhh gimme a sec... loloh shot gotta download 3k mb lol
[4:27:42] <%RioGascar> Im surprised edmund has been able to survive in a landscape thats evolved fast. but he has a established fan base so good on him
[4:27:47] <am_omega> The "I Wanna Be The" games are a whole genre.
[4:27:59] <%RioGascar> i think hes also doing a isaac card game series
[4:28:09] <$Noponiz> i wanna be that guy is for cowards. I wanna be the boshi is the real shit
[4:28:16] <FackinCrazy> I want Binding of Isaac 2 so bad
[4:28:21] <0rond> oh yeah there was four souls, the binding of isaac card game. it's really good
[4:28:21] <quasiplaying> @Estuko hahaha take your time man and as soon as you open it up again you'll be bombarded with event notifications and other good shit lol XD
[4:28:30] <californaya> yeah, the Issac card game exists, Four Souls is pretty alright
[4:28:58] <serpenttucker> Man when the hell is repentance coming out?
[4:29:07] <Bryon_Youngblood> What the heck??? XD
[4:29:24] <Darren716> Man i forgot about the isaac card game, despite it being right under my bed
[4:29:24] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1229464161366794241?s=19
[4:29:30] <+gantz_zero> speaking of Trow Up
[4:29:36] <+gantz_zero> Throw*
[4:29:40] <0rond> if you don't intend to play this game religiously, I 100% recommend looking up the endings @WoolieVersus
[4:29:57] <+SirGO0SE> psaFist
[4:30:05] <quasiplaying> @WoolieVersus If there is any game I would recommend Woolie its Honkai Impact 3rd
[4:30:05] <Laecerelius> tripped over the finish line
[4:30:07] <+gantz_zero> @0rond dude he's already got 40+ hours in
[4:30:12] <0rond> oh shit
[4:30:14] <0rond> nevermind than
[4:30:15] <+Estuko> @quasiplaying npnp lol
[4:30:41] <zenith0111> This seems like a nice little game
[4:30:43] <+Bluydee> I’ve never seen this game before
[4:30:44] <@Solidus_113> NEEDLES??
[4:30:44] <MayorRev> LUCKY TED
[4:30:51] <MayorRev> DRUGS
[4:31:00] <+Bluydee> there’s a boi deckbuilding game?
[4:31:07] <zenith0111> I love the popsicle sticks LUL
[4:31:19] <%RioGascar> I could see myself playing this during waiting in between college classes
[4:31:20] <0rond> honkai 3rd impact is like, it's wooliebait, but it's just the bait, nothing inside he will actually like other than it
[4:31:28] <MayorRev> Combo!
[4:31:35] <serpenttucker> You generally get the same progression based on what character you are on and what you have unlocked so far
[4:31:39] <%RioGascar> like how i play fuck tons of into the breach while waiting for class
[4:31:40] <42nfl19> I was away, who won the last game?
[4:31:42] <zenith0111> SourPls
[4:31:44] <JoeyStar> @bluydee yep it’s called binding of isaac four souls
[4:31:56] <serpenttucker> But enemies, spells and items aquired, etc is randomized
[4:31:57] <zenith0111> Music finally picking up
[4:31:57] <quasiplaying> Memento Yae Sakura Is basically judgement cuttiong for her charged attacks lol
[4:31:58] <MayorRev> they tapped out last game cuz it took too long
[4:31:59] <0rond> four souls is really good. it reminds me of munchkin a lot
[4:32:14] <MayorRev> now its bumbo time
[4:32:21] <VJdarkworld> bum-boclaat
[4:32:45] <%jiggy_snipe> @42nfl19 Minh was leading but they ended early because it was getting boring
[4:32:53] <0rond> @WoolieVersus did you get to the endings with the DEEP LORE regarding binding of isaac?
[4:33:23] <%RioGascar> I actually like this a lot more than isaac
[4:33:28] <%RioGascar> the loot is clear
[4:33:29] <quasiplaying> @0rond Memento Yae Sakura basically judgement cuts during her charged attacks big baits for him
[4:33:40] <%RioGascar> musics dope
[4:33:56] <%RioGascar> i really dig the aesthetic of this cardboard cutout stuff
[4:33:57] <0rond> yeah but the game is mostly automatic+ it's gacha and pretty shallow overall
[4:34:03] <+Mercer618> @quasiplaying she really is, but unless you lucksack her in the gacha then you're looking at a year or so of gathering fragments for her
[4:34:08] <segbas2004> baka
[4:34:12] <SoySocks> NotLikeThis
[4:34:14] <MayorRev> oh dear
[4:34:15] <+gantz_zero> @quasiplaying o see upir jpmlers o,[act
[4:34:18] <+gantz_zero> wow
[4:34:18] <0rond> that's why I said, it's strong wooliebait, but only on the surface
[4:34:23] <serpenttucker> I wonder what modding for this game will look like outside of custom spells and relics
[4:34:25] <+gantz_zero> let me try that again
[4:34:31] <%RioGascar> i disagree, its got layers
[4:34:32] <+gantz_zero> @quasiplaying i see your honkers impact
[4:34:36] <quasiplaying> @Mercer618 Now you can just farm her
[4:34:54] <MayorRev> Tetris 99 have co-op?
[4:35:03] <+Mercer618> Oh right with the purple tear looking things
[4:35:09] <gade177> Oh yeah Tetris is the most addicting game ever.
[4:35:13] <%yeknomlive> digestable?
[4:35:15] <quasiplaying> @gantz_zero You mean Thirst Impact XD
[4:35:28] <0rond> tetris is the OG video game addiction.
[4:35:43] <+gantz_zero> honestly i just call it honkers because it's impossible for most people to get past the "Honkai" word @quasiplaying
[4:35:51] <%SomersaultJustice> that explains everything
[4:36:05] <+Mercer618> @gantz_zero literally same. I just call it Honkers
[4:36:10] <%yeknomlive> woolieFUN
[4:36:16] <rubbishbinge> chinese gacha bait is getting strong
[4:36:17] <0rond> there's the missing link of how Woolie "fighting games" woolz got into tetris
[4:36:24] <GeltonZ> Tetrisphere was awesome!
[4:36:24] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:36:44] <quasiplaying> @gantz_zero Himeko has the largest compared to Rita
[4:36:45] <0rond> tetris sphere is woolie's hill to die on
[4:36:58] <0rond> FACETRIS WAS THE BEST ONE
[4:37:00] <+Estuko> @quasiplaying Himeko is big, but... Rita is my wife.
[4:37:05] <+gantz_zero> @quasiplaying yeah but no one knows about Ayla in Punishing Gray Raven
[4:37:31] <rubbishbinge> @gantz_zero just pulled her yesterday lol
[4:37:31] <quasiplaying> @gantz_zero Nah Himeko deserves her happy ending, I'll be that captain
[4:37:39] <+linSP> linSP subscribed at Tier 1. 
[4:37:44] <0rond> I would have considered getting into honkai 3rd impact if I wasn't already deep into FGO and just got into symphogear XDU
[4:37:55] <quasiplaying> @gantz_zero who knows when that ever comes out but right now I'm waiting on Dragon Raja
[4:37:56] <+gantz_zero> @quasiplaying i do love Himeko the most
[4:38:04] <MayorRev> are those tapeworms?
[4:38:08] <SoySocks> either toilet paper or tapeworms
[4:38:09] <MayorRev> oh
[4:38:13] <0rond> nah they are toilet papers for sure
[4:38:20] <+Mercer618> See I'm just an idiot and got into honkai impact after being neck deep in Fire Emblem Heroes, FGO, and Dragalia
[4:38:22] <+gantz_zero> @quasiplaying i've been playing PGR since january. even without reading most of it, it's still incredibly fun on an emulator
[4:38:39] <Slimeking_Mike> Oh, like Asswipe?
[4:38:40] <%yeknomlive> like poop
[4:38:40] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Asswipe
[4:38:41] <MayorRev> EQUAL TO POOP
[4:38:47] <SoySocks> asswipe
[4:38:53] <0rond> edmund drew many, many tapeworms, that's not what his tapeworms look like
[4:38:53] <serpenttucker> Asswipe is a close approximate
[4:38:59] <+SirGO0SE> hell is always having a poopy butt that repoops itself after every wipe and you only have the thinnest roughest single ply
[4:39:04] <Oxybe> asswipe. bogrroll.
[4:39:05] <quasiplaying> @gantz_zero The way I see it its basically Neir Automata meets steampunk but yeah, that game looks great
[4:39:14] <+Shen2> LUL
[4:39:15] <xstormyone> can reggie confirm if its hurts more?
[4:39:18] <MayorRev> MOTHAFUCKA
[4:39:22] <youlookokgetin> Butt tissue
[4:39:29] <serpenttucker> WOOOOOOAH
[4:39:38] <0rond> but it's so shallow, it's like if you only had the auto modes of bayo and nier automata
[4:40:02] <+gantz_zero> @0rond PGR?
[4:40:10] <0rond> Honkai 3rd impact
[4:40:13] <+gantz_zero> ah
[4:40:23] <quasiplaying> @gantz_zero Punishing Gray Raven
[4:40:26] <serpenttucker> @WoolieVersus Show us at least a 7 bone setup
[4:40:41] <SoySocks> I love that lighting effect
[4:40:43] <+gantz_zero> mostly asking him if he meant gray raven or honkai @quasiplaying
[4:40:50] <+SirGO0SE> the lighting on that is great
[4:40:53] <+Estuko> Wanna know how to do a fucking bone infinite
[4:40:54] <Jack_of_No_Trades> getting psychonauts vibes
[4:40:58] <quasiplaying> @gantz_zero ah ok
[4:41:15] <%RioGascar> Gibs are body parts
[4:41:24] <Dutchpotato> But what if bumbo?
[4:41:27] <%RioGascar> just a person exploded with a rocket launcher
[4:41:32] <%RioGascar> thats getting gibbed
[4:41:42] <+gantz_zero> a gib is roughly any chunk of flesh iirc @WoolieVersus
[4:41:47] <MayorRev> But Bumbo is cant is not you is not wall!
[4:42:02] <quasiplaying> @gantz_zero Seele though is the purest child and needs constant protection
[4:42:58] <+gantz_zero> @quasiplaying seele is good, i wish they'd give fua ha mandatory glasses. i feel like she loses a lot of character without them, no matter what uniform
[4:43:54] <quasiplaying> @gantz_zero Does she really htough? I always thought its for aesthetics since she's "immortal"
[4:43:54] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:43:55] <+Mercer618> @gantz_zero why can't her augment outfit have the glasses? The monocle is wack and she loses character without the glasses
[4:44:27] <MayorRev> damn woolie
[4:45:00] <+gantz_zero> yeah i agree @Mercer618 . well yeah, she just always looks smart and it's pretty unique because no one else wears glasses practically ever @quasiplaying
[4:45:26] <quasiplaying> @Mercer618 I could agree with all that, but they defintely gave her that bit of extra love with her awakened form ie Sage Fuhua
[4:45:41] <Huntercd> Who is winning?
[4:45:49] <MayorRev> Yes
[4:45:51] <+gantz_zero> poop is winning @Huntercd
[4:46:46] <MayorRev> "Pop this bone and get a five piss"
[4:46:56] <serpenttucker> It's so weird seeing speedruns for RNG heavy games.
[4:47:23] <%StaceMcGate> five minute speedruns for Slay the Spire blow my mind
[4:47:25] <chambatron> psaGib psaGib psaGib
[4:47:32] <arkv01> we'll see you at GDQ then woolie LUL
[4:47:53] <bevyrage> why not destroy the tiles that are no good against these guys?
[4:48:24] <MayorRev> Gibs is an ass
[4:48:51] <%HelghastTroop> in early versions of this gibs was a joke
[4:49:21] <%trustycoyote> The Woolie out of context twitter account has enough source material for days.
[4:49:32] <+Estuko> @quasiplaying start of Chapter 5 atm, middle of chapter 4 on Hard
[4:49:55] <%StaceMcGate> Say Mike Digger 3 times fast
[4:50:01] <quasiplaying> @Estuko OH.....you got a ways to go then
[4:50:03] <Amardeux> maybe use your destroy all tiles of same type for more bones LUL
[4:50:20] <MayorRev> PogChamp
[4:50:22] <MayorRev> CLUTCH
[4:50:23] <+Estuko> @quasiplaying yuuuuup, maybe when I break from Dissidia I'll prob get to Honkai lol.
[4:50:23] <californaya> VICTORY
[4:50:25] <Amardeux> noice one PogChamp
[4:50:27] <Oxybe> Nice
[4:50:36] <%HelghastTroop> Hell ys my favorite level music is next !!!!!!
[4:50:38] <Huntercd> Is that a meat cube?

[5:00:46] <%RioGascar> i do like the merit of games that exist for like casually chipping away
[5:00:47] <0rond> play bumbo the nimble, he is crazy
[5:00:54] <RyuuAoi> If at first you don't succeed, dust yourself off and try again!
[5:00:55] <@chesterr01> @woolieversus absolute garbage skills
[5:01:04] <SoySocks> that's how it is in isaac as well with the character "The Lost"
[5:01:08] <0rond> bumbo the nimble is the most fun
[5:01:09] <%mitchteck> F
[5:01:09] <heartlesshealer> oh man, you've got that thing going on
[5:01:13] <%linSP> bumbo dead is great, those flies man
[5:01:15] <+BurkeBigsby> Jist like using The Lost is torture in Isaac.
[5:01:18] <0rond> yeah this is a character from BOI too
[5:01:19] <%RioGascar> @chesterr01 Dont you have some feet pics to see?
[5:01:19] <MayorRev> Is Dead your main?
[5:01:20] <damienlunas> Isn't The Dead like the best character in the game, or did they nerf him?
[5:01:25] <$TIME_PUNCHER> spirit hearts
[5:01:28] <0rond> he only has soul hearts in isaac too @WoolieVersus
[5:01:31] <@chesterr01> @riogascar DansGame
[5:01:35] <Flarepulse> woolie isn't it past your bedtime
[5:01:39] <quasiplaying> @Estuko You heard of Dragon Raja though ?

[5:02:17] <MayorRev> only REAL bumbo fans here!
[5:02:42] <%DomPressesButtons> DomPressesButtons subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[5:02:56] <$TIME_PUNCHER> Man, NL looks great with dreads psaSmug
[5:02:56] <%RioGascar> i think the switch is like the perfect indie game machine. it let me play SOOOO much into the breach in between my classes
[5:03:14] <heartlesshealer> Yeah I can see why getting good at this guy ruins you for the other characters
[5:03:17] <MayorRev> eww
[5:03:29] <dan_g_v> clench plays
[5:03:39] <$TIME_PUNCHER> blow out actual assholes
[5:03:56] <heartlesshealer> down or right
[5:04:06] <dan_g_v> @time_puncher indeed, the egg finally grew his hair
[5:04:07] <+Estuko> @quasiplaying nope
[5:04:19] <espanishcanamurciana> is this the garfield tactical card game @WoolieVersus ??
[5:04:19] <GarbageNirvana> Never understood why these games always have to be gross
[5:04:25] <dan_g_v> and he finally took some sun
[5:04:29] <GarbageNirvana> I guess that's just Ed McMillen's particular design sensibilities
[5:04:31] <%RioGascar> Its edmunds style sorta
[5:04:34] <%ChoculaUltra> is there an official pc version of teppen or is it solely through android emulation?
[5:04:49] <$TIME_PUNCHER> because breadmund, @garbagenirvana
[5:04:53] <0rond> most puzzle games are usually go for the "slick, clean, organized" look
[5:05:05] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> only woolie is left?
[5:05:05] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:05:08] <+MrAtheGreat> Ah yes, now I remember wtf bum-bo is
[5:05:08] <quasiplaying> @Estuko I would highly suggest you give it a look, very customizable especially character creation
[5:05:09] <SoySocks> watch out for that second primed attack in the back
[5:05:15] <0rond> minh and reggie perished
[5:05:18] <+MrAtheGreat> Made in unity, I see
[5:05:27] <%RioGascar> well they do that cause the ui needs to be clean and understandable to establish the rules correctly
[5:05:32] <%ChoculaUltra> woolie consumed minh and reggie for their life essence.
[5:05:32] <heartlesshealer> one row to the right, two columns down
[5:05:34] <heartlesshealer> or end
[5:05:39] <%DomPressesButtons> ooph
[5:05:51] <lotharrio> Blue health, though.
[5:05:51] <+mankeyfigh> Oh he was talking about this game on a stream a while back
[5:05:54] <$TIME_PUNCHER> pretty sure one of the Isaac trailers has Edmund and his friends buck-ass naked
[5:06:05] <+MrAtheGreat> VICTORY
[5:06:09] <0rond> but than you have this game where you have multiple sprites for each color, and the game has a much more messy feel
[5:06:22] <0rond> it goes against the norm in that regard
[5:06:23] <MayorRev> hi punchmom!
[5:06:31] <%Kahiir> Kahiir subscribed with Twitch Prime.

[5:14:04] <arkv01> @0rond I coulda sworn woolie was here all night by his lonesome..
[5:14:07] <damienlunas> You can use pooped tiles, you just can't see them. Also, if that tile moves in any way, the poop clears.
[5:14:12] <+SirGO0SE> ah so it doesnt change the tile into crap, it just hides what it is
[5:14:20] <%RioGascar> i dont think isaac four souls is actually retail out? Isnt it kickstarter?
[5:14:24] <arkv01> man that turdman kinda looks like... pat
[5:14:32] <+Goobbue> @RioGascar it is retail out
[5:14:34] <heartlesshealer> so what's the deal with the those garbage tiles?
[5:14:35] <0rond> it's brownie, he was in super meatboy
[5:14:41] <heartlesshealer> oh!
[5:15:02] <SoySocks> wait, they're not unusable, they're just blind?!?
[5:15:08] <cptkraut> hey woolie and chat :)
[5:15:17] <%king_wragles> Is this just for the stream, or is Woolie getting LP footage rn?
[5:15:18] <jaid251> The music is very good
[5:15:18] <%RioGascar> damn, well then. Speaking of board games. i need some recommendations for a boardgame for friends who like deception and hidden agenda games
[5:15:22] <heartlesshealer> blind tiles is somehow scarier
[5:15:24] <%Javaa01> It's Mega Brownie, also not a bro like Brownie was
[5:15:36] <%RioGascar> we have played: coup, secret hitler, betrayl, and dead of winter
[5:15:47] <MayorRev> put more poop up woolie
[5:15:52] <%RioGascar> Oh and cash and guns
[5:16:13] <0rond> there's werewolf
[5:16:30] <%RioGascar> we dont often have enough people for that
[5:16:41] <%RioGascar> most we got is 8, usually we are 5-6
[5:16:44] <+SirGO0SE> PogChamp
[5:16:52] <%RioGascar> Sometimes less around 4-5
[5:17:22] <heartlesshealer> line up tower of yellow?
[5:17:23] <0rond> maybe avalon?
[5:17:44] <%RioGascar> I’ll keep that one in mind
[5:17:57] <0rond> the genre you are looking for is called "social deduction games"
[5:18:15] <heartlesshealer> possibly more reeth
[5:18:17] <heartlesshealer> maybe
[5:18:23] <%Vegaburd> move bones
[5:18:25] <MayorRev> oh no

[5:19:50] <%Vegaburd> ALWAYS MIDDLE
[5:19:54] <%Vegaburd> smh
[5:20:00] <+SirGO0SE> oh man its followable right until the end
[5:20:07] <bevyrage> yeah it's always middle
[5:20:07] <%Javaa01> Because you don't actually have health containers as Blue Baby
[5:20:16] <%Vegaburd> no
[5:20:19] <%Vegaburd> im just memeing
[5:20:22] <%Vegaburd> wait
[5:20:22] <+Estuko> LUL
[5:20:22] <bevyrage> been a staple since binding of isaac
[5:20:23] <heartlesshealer> very bumbo
[5:20:28] <MayorRev> dont lie to him!!!!
[5:20:28] <+Estuko> @Vegaburd Hi One Guy :)
[5:20:37] <+SirGO0SE> psa1guy
[5:20:41] <MayorRev> Nice job one guy
[5:20:44] <am_omega> Oh no
[5:20:45] <+MoonToxin> who would lie on the internet :<
[5:20:45] <0rond> the binding of isaac staple is never play the shell game because it's garbage and not worth it
[5:20:49] <%Vegaburd> @Estuko its me!
[5:20:54] <%RioGascar> One guy in a chat of 20 active chatters
[5:20:56] <%RioGascar> rip
[5:21:04] <bevyrage> binding of isaac was 50% middle prize while sides were 25%
[5:21:16] <bevyrage> bum-bo apparently has the same rate
[5:21:20] <arkv01> sending my chemicals to help you combat the poopies LuvHearts LuvHearts LuvHearts
[5:21:34] <0rond> what?
[5:21:39] <0rond> where are you getting that info?
[5:21:40] <am_omega> I am just downloadin my anniemays, like Galvion and the Giant Robo OVA.
[5:21:48] <%RioGascar> See if it was real life it would be neither sides cause the con artists quickly zoomed it up their sleevs
[5:22:14] <heartlesshealer> oooh combo
[5:22:17] <heartlesshealer> nice
[5:22:34] <heartlesshealer> hmm
[5:22:40] <heartlesshealer> can enemies overheal?
[5:22:49] <BadgerDK> what if there's only 1
[5:22:50] <+RenoDeGeneric> You can also just kill the last one for free right?
[5:23:03] <SoySocks> @WoolieVersus good if there's one enemy left, or if you can use it at the start of a room
[5:23:08] <%RioGascar> Wait can you just 1 shot a boss?
[5:23:14] <heartlesshealer> dang
[5:23:23] <heartlesshealer> spend one poop to get 5
[5:23:29] <am_omega> Oh man what if that works on bosses?
[5:23:40] <+Pyrophant> skipping boss rooms skips boss rewards though
[5:23:48] <%Javaa01> Yeah, but the skip does come at the cost of not getting the coins for killing the boss
[5:24:01] <+Estuko> @heartlesshealer that is just beautiful wording.
[5:24:04] <%RioGascar> gotta weight benefits and cons
[5:24:06] <reonome> holy shit woolie playing bumbo
[5:24:10] <segbas2004> big poo
[5:24:15] <heartlesshealer> thanks
[5:24:18] <%RioGascar> cause maybe that boss will rekt your sh it
[5:24:23] <reonome> did the devs fix all the game breaking bugs yet
[5:24:23] <0rond> why didn't you take sleight hand earlier (spells cost less for the room) wouldn't it basically give you infinite movement?
[5:24:38] <%Vegaburd> oof
[5:24:44] <+RenoDeGeneric> Use it to kill the last one alive
[5:24:48] <heartlesshealer> oh wow
[5:24:54] <segbas2004> big yikes
[5:24:55] <heartlesshealer> yeah that's not great at all
[5:25:03] <am_omega> Save it for the last enemy in the room.
[5:25:04] <%linSP> is the attack fly still bugged?
[5:25:04] <SoySocks> not good, but could help with final enemy in a room
[5:25:09] <+Pyrophant> @0rond i think theres a lower limit for spell costs to avoid that
[5:25:35] <0rond> really? edmund usually encourages crazy broken combos rather than limit them?
[5:25:41] <+valiard> yeah if it's the final enemy should be really strong
[5:26:00] <%RioGascar> well a puzzle game needs more “balancing”
[5:26:03] <%dantejoestar21> dantejoestar21 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[5:26:09] <heartlesshealer> uhh
[5:26:18] <%RioGascar> it cant just be super fucked hard at the beginning for example
[5:26:20] <am_omega> So that won't rez enemies so just use it on the last enemy in a room.
[5:26:20] <hntronium> Wasn't the one on the left under fly dot?
[5:26:37] <segbas2004> you can have crazy good run too, like isaac
[5:26:37] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:26:44] <%JetpackMcQuack> This is like the old solo stuff

[5:27:41] <segbas2004> I never did a 7 yet, I suck at puzzle games XD
[5:27:53] <0rond> in practice teeth is more like the death tarot card
[5:27:59] <hl98> is this the same woolie from game grumps?
[5:28:09] <+SirGO0SE> @hl98 LUL
[5:28:10] <%RioGascar> ...no????
[5:28:14] <am_omega> Man that would be great if we saw the final ending on stream.
[5:28:15] <0rond> yes, this is woolie formely of game grumps fame
[5:28:22] <heartlesshealer> from spiderman, yeah
[5:28:26] <rosemon5001> @segbas2004 easy just switch your mindset to i want coin and you can do it

[5:29:14] <+SirGO0SE> loonies twonies and poonies
[5:29:39] <+Pyrophant> does the block spell carry over turns?
[5:29:39] <heartlesshealer> no idea what to set up

[5:30:18] <heartlesshealer> move poop up?
[5:30:26] <heartlesshealer> then down the column of teeth?
[5:30:28] <heartlesshealer> or do that
[5:31:22] <%Vegaburd> use kill spell
[5:31:23] <heartlesshealer> good job
[5:31:34] <heartlesshealer> single enemie
[5:31:36] <heartlesshealer> enemy*
[5:31:37] <%Javaa01> Now you could use the spell to kill the worm
[5:31:54] <%RioGascar> Thats a pretty big waste of teeth tho

[5:36:57] <heartlesshealer> and then start moving stuff
[5:37:03] <segbas2004> maybe because there's only one ennemy?
[5:37:19] <%RioGascar> it should at least say something in its text blurb. (Wont work on bosses or sole enemy)

[5:50:31] <+umber_helgramite> couldnt you kill a spell for it?
[5:50:35] <0rond> but this is every room instead of every 2 rooms
[5:50:46] <MayorRev> I'd report it to the devs tbh
[5:51:06] <%Javaa01> Yeah, this battery is a lot more consistent
[5:51:31] <heartlesshealer> auto attack???

[5:53:44] <heartlesshealer> nvm
[5:53:49] <+umber_helgramite> i find your lack of poop disturbing
[5:54:01] <0rond> the boss is immune to puzzles though
[5:54:04] <+valiard> skipping out on the 7 bone multi hit combo?
[5:54:08] <+SirGO0SE> someone set us up the poop
[5:54:15] <zeif00> do you know how late it is young man?
[5:54:17] <0rond> 7 bones won't do anything

[5:57:12] <+umber_helgramite> lots of bones
[5:57:16] <heartlesshealer> uhh
[5:57:25] <heartlesshealer> maybe
[5:57:45] <+PapaGravestone> wait a minute is this that game by the people that did binding of isaac? this art style is rad
[5:57:46] <heartlesshealer> dang
[5:57:48] <+umber_helgramite> half way
[5:57:52] <zenith0111> NotLikeThis
[5:58:03] <+umber_helgramite> sell all stocks
[5:58:07] <+SirGO0SE> BibleThump
[5:58:07] <Djinnazz> 5 pee
[5:58:08] <+umber_helgramite> invest in feces
[5:58:10] <hntronium> go for extra move?
[5:58:25] <0rond> YOU CAN BLOCK
[5:58:35] <0rond> this is super doable
[5:58:42] <heartlesshealer> move bottom row one
[5:58:52] <heartlesshealer> or do that
[5:58:55] <%RioGascar> i feel it should be having a confirmation system for the tile movement. Or a into the breach style reverse
[5:59:03] <am_omega> You can poop
[5:59:11] <hntronium> you can poop
[5:59:13] <heartlesshealer> armor
[5:59:29] <reonome> you need a spell
[5:59:34] <%RioGascar> And also the system being the way it is...might be why its not on switch. Touch would be a pain in the ass for this
[5:59:34] <heartlesshealer> yeah
[5:59:34] <bevyrage> move poop for double stack of poop?
[6:00:04] <bevyrage> forgive me punch dad
[6:00:08] <+umber_helgramite> I would setup boogers for next turn
[6:00:22] <reonome> move bottom row left
[6:00:22] <+umber_helgramite> I see 6 boog
[6:00:26] <reonome> i mean right
[6:00:29] <+umber_helgramite> 6 is better than 7
[6:00:32] <arkv01> man this game would be nuts with a mick gordo soundtrack
[6:00:38] <+umber_helgramite> 7 is 2 6 is three
[6:00:59] <heartlesshealer> puzzle time
[6:01:00] <+SirGO0SE> sound track is already so good
[6:01:02] <reonome> BONE HER
[6:01:04] <XzileGaming> there WAS a 6 teeth move i was just dying to say.
[6:01:05] <%RioGascar> It would be weird
[6:01:19] <heartlesshealer> that was scary
[6:01:23] <+Estuko> FUCK

[6:01:56] <Valdorick> Lucky Ted!
[6:02:00] <%Javaa01> Though you MIGHT respawn with 1 Red heart

[6:02:17] <LiveStudioBrian> bruh
[6:02:18] <wegood456> Sometimes your luck just hypnotize me
[6:02:19] <0rond> he will probably respawn with 3 soul hearts
[6:02:20] <Djinnazz> more luck= Unlucky
[6:02:21] <+Spr0cket> lucky ted want coin
[6:02:21] <+Sayie> Lucky Ted reborn!
[6:02:21] <BlackMage66652> LUCKY TEDUMBO
[6:02:23] <+umber_helgramite> could be free combos later
[6:02:35] <0rond> ah yes, northernlion luck
[6:02:36] <$Noponiz> the 1 up tho
[6:02:40] <%RioGascar> Does luck possibly influence the grid spawns?
[6:02:41] <$Noponiz> believe
[6:02:44] <bevyrage> if it works the same as binding of isaac, the 1up will give him his run starting health
[6:02:48] <am_omega> "No I am so unlucky, I got luck!"
[6:02:51] <%trustycoyote> It would suck if the higher the luck stat... the more luck you get NotLikeThis
[6:02:53] <hntronium> Did woolie pick the 1up or the health from kills?
[6:02:59] <+umber_helgramite> confidence is key
[6:03:06] <bevyrage> 1up. health from kills doesn't restore soul hearts
[6:03:07] <+SirGO0SE> !motivated
[6:03:07] <@Moobot> 677 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[6:03:13] <bevyrage> !motivated
[6:03:14] <am_omega> Work that 1 am brain
[6:03:17] <hntronium> Would the kill heals actually have worked for blue hearts?
[6:03:22] <heartlesshealer> toothy boy?
[6:03:25] <0rond> I feel like he had 2 chances to super break and exploit the game, and he skipped both
[6:03:27] <%Javaa01> Nope
[6:03:41] <%Javaa01> Blue hearts can't be healed
[6:03:42] <+SirGO0SE> i dont think he knew about the free movement @0rond
[6:03:47] <XzileGaming> probably not @hntronium didnt work in isaac
[6:03:47] <arkv01> dignity and dabs
[6:03:58] <%Javaa01> And he has no Red heart containers to fill
[6:04:00] <+umber_helgramite> B O N E S A C T I V A T E D
[6:04:01] <0rond> both free spells at low HP and sleight of hand could have worked
[6:04:03] <heartlesshealer> mana drain
[6:04:05] <heartlesshealer> dang
[6:04:08] <hntronium> DOOM
[6:04:16] <+SirGO0SE> big poo and pee combos

[6:04:19] <+Estuko> FeelsBadMan
[6:04:26] <arkv01> @0rond it's cool, I like it when there's a lot of fumbling and stumbling
[6:04:35] <+umber_helgramite> any def would fix this
[6:04:39] <+SirGO0SE> big stumbo for bumbo
[6:04:45] <0rond> yeah no, it's still a super fun stream, I don't care for the gameplay much
[6:04:47] <BlackMage66652> StumboVersus
[6:04:56] <heartlesshealer> that mana drain is a bitch
[6:05:06] <reonome> godammit woolie LUL

[6:05:45] <am_omega> We still in PogChamp
[6:05:57] <+Pyrophant> despite woolies efforts to go to sleep, the game wants to be beaten
[6:06:05] <%Javaa01> Because the 1 UP is kinda weird with Blue Baby in Isaac
[6:06:09] <+SirGO0SE> COMBO
[6:06:11] <+Estuko> dookie
[6:06:18] <heartlesshealer> star

[0:24:43] <%reknownblackcat> reknownblackcat subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months, currently on a 3 month streak! YOO SUPER HYPE FOR SOME UMVC3! I literally bought this from steam sale because of you. Trying to lab on a pad.

[0:28:24] <alephalpha> @empanadadejq Part of it i s not ahving extensively played the game and the other half is everyons brain being to slow and dumb actually. Plus in fighting games if you're thinking that probably emans you're losing cause you aren't just doing
[0:28:45] <thatangryguyofde> @nekros4442 Yo watching videos with Godlike Thor is lytMYHERO

[0:29:13] <%Doplghost> you can show the fruit of your efforts
[0:29:34] <CyrusVGZ> Then you play an actual game and the muscle memory Scott Pilgrims out the window.
[0:29:42] <madboaroffaerghus> This game looks really good for something that came out so many years ago.
[0:30:09] <%Doplghost> This game has aged so well.

[0:31:03] <%Irridium> oh god I'm gonna get bodied so hard. fuck.
[0:31:04] <gordieda20> BIONIC ARRRRRRM
[0:31:19] <%redhotdivekick> Why must MVC be dead ;-; I wish for a new, good Mahvel every day
[0:31:21] <ProxyDoug> So weird to see Doom without his skirt
[0:31:27] <%ChoculaUltra> last week they were rusty, but now they got their bnbs down pat
[0:31:32] <%Doplghost> how different Marvel comics was compared to Marvel infinate when they wanted to base it more off the movies
[0:31:44] <extradopeness> It’s great to see woolie playing the same team after all these years
[0:31:47] <%heartlesshealer> skirt? I always thought Doom was just wearing a tunic
[0:32:03] <alephalpha> it's a tunic
[0:32:08] <%ChoculaUltra> Doom dresses in drag as he pleases!
[0:32:08] <%Doplghost> it is a tunic
[0:32:08] <antyriku2> vergils block animation is real nice
[0:32:11] <%FuqBoiSlim> Doom was wearing the Hero of Time fit LUL
[0:32:21] <%Clundy> I thought it was a tabard?
[0:32:26] <%mighty_max_t> my main thing is why does MVCI have to be 50gb? if it was like 20, I could just leave it installed but man, that's too big
[0:32:37] <%ChoculaUltra> it's definitely more of a tabard thing
[0:32:41] <thatangryguyofde> The irony of spencer being loved in this game, but his last game was like 20K copies sold lytROLLWIP
[0:32:48] <%FuqBoiSlim> why on earth is a fighting more than 20gb?
[0:32:53] <alephalpha> suprised you don't play zero woolie
[0:33:04] <ProxyDoug> It's so weird to see Doom with booty shorts
[0:33:09] <%threecheats> woolieGASM
[0:33:12] <%Doplghost> people fell in lovem with that Spencer design after marvel 3, but before then it was disliked greatly
[0:33:17] <asurasmath> the loops
[0:33:23] <%ChoculaUltra> iirc, this is the Doomwar Armor he had when he rendered all Vibranium on the planet inert
[0:33:28] <theobble> GRABBITY SQUEEB
[0:33:29] <%heartlesshealer> subligars are just weird superhero standard for outfits
[0:33:29] <%redhotdivekick> SQUEEZE THAT BITCH
[0:33:31] <extradopeness> Doom nooooo
[0:33:32] <Pechugaman> tekken is 70 gigs tho
[0:33:37] <%Doplghost> because that game came out around the same time as Bionic Commando Rearmed
[0:33:38] <gordieda20> GRAVITY SQUEEZEE
[0:33:54] <coreybom> @fuqboislim For something like MK11, I get why, but something like infinite is insane.

[0:35:10] <%Doplghost> theres no point in doing something more risky but damaging when you can just do a BnB if both deal 6K damage total
[0:35:14] <+RocketBarrel> Absolutely nothing is compressed in Blazblue
[0:35:24] <ProxyDoug> Only now I noticed the webcam at the bottom
[0:35:24] <%FuqBoiSlim> it's probably just uncompressed audio now that I think about it

[0:37:23] <%Doplghost> is it the story mode that its installing
[0:37:31] <%Clundy> Ye

[1:20:11] <%SvenHolgersson> The roster is just so FRESH
[1:20:11] <Man_in_the_Red> so if i was to run Felicia-Magneto, who would make a good 3rd pick in UMVC3

[1:50:59] <BreakersAweigh> @MrAtheGreat 5 for sure
[1:51:02] <DMatts142> @AlteisenReiseZ huh, Ive watched so many tourneys for this but never noticed. Probably too many buttons being pressed to hear lol
[1:51:05] <%Irridium> I mean no reason to not have both. but I'd hope for 5. @MrAtheGreat
[1:51:07] <huskarl_zap> Would Safe space and Snowflake appear in MvC5?
[1:51:08] <%FuqBoiSlim> Its definitely gonna be 5 with 4 as an alt costume possibly
[1:51:09] <DMatts142> ty though!

[1:52:06] <alephalpha> nero would eb agrappler like how sol badguy is a grappler
[1:52:07] <+MrAtheGreat> @balloniwright i would hope he has at least a few grapples
[1:52:17] <+Thunderhog> Timmer scam
[1:52:23] <alephalpha> but like with a lot of grapples for combos ala bullet
[1:52:27] <ISkyHunterI> nero should have a follow up move for most of his attacks to rev red queen
[1:52:38] <%Irridium> nero would probably be a charge character with a few command grabs
[1:52:38] <%Struggleful> SLO MOTION
[1:52:39] <huskarl_zap> Woolie cowardin out
[1:52:41] <%Superbro64> marvel 3 netcode SeriousSloth

[1:52:45] <spardanwarrior> At minimum Nero should have Buster and Grim Grip
[1:52:47] <+MrAtheGreat> Wait would there be a devil breaker mechanic?
[1:52:47] <%Wool> RIP Texas internet, GGs
[1:52:53] <+MrAtheGreat> O.o
[1:53:03] <%CaptainPileDriver> nero would use the dmc5 moveset and his arm gimmick would be to cycle through his arms and he would get a different special move per arm, at least 1-2
[1:53:03] <%ChoculaUltra> not bad for playing from all the way in Texas going to Canadia tbh
[1:53:25] <ISkyHunterI> I would prefere no gimmick and just give him different moves from different arms
[1:53:33] <%FuqBoiSlim> I wanna see Gerbera's ult in a fighting game. I need it
[1:53:33] <alephalpha> if it was an arcsys game I'd imagien tehre would be adevil breaker mechanic I'd imagine in marvel he'd just have move for the arms
[1:53:33] <Man_in_the_Red> Nero having Exceed could either be all his moves with it make him top tier, or its impossible to do
[1:53:44] <@Menitta> mag fuckin neto
[1:53:45] <%kyh9> Would love to see you guys play MUA3

[1:53:53] <+Jaysky> DOOM
[1:53:54] <+MrAtheGreat> I suppose that would kill the alt costume if he had devil breaker tho
[1:53:57] <%JuliusGemstone> I cant get the lobby to show.
[1:54:03] <%JuliusGemstone> I am so sad.
[1:54:07] <huskarl_zap> okay wtf Reggie
[1:54:12] <%SirGO0SE> D: REGGIE
[1:54:18] <%ChoculaUltra> that Fantastic 4/Doom dlc for MUA 3 was so much better than I thought it was going to be
[1:54:18] <Man_in_the_Red> maybe he should just get Exceed as a meter that makes his specials EX

[1:54:53] <Kitsunerasu> can you imagine reving mid combo lmao thatd be nuts
[1:54:53] <+Jaysky> Kinda wish Taskmaster had a better voice

[1:57:10] <Man_in_the_Red> its a good habit
[1:57:12] <%FuqBoiSlim> I'm still not really sure who is at fault with MVCI exactly. Is it Disney's? Capcom's? Is it MY fault???

[1:57:29] <+MrAtheGreat> @man_in_the_red freaking disney :(
[1:58:04] <%ChoculaUltra> if we're keeping it real tho? New Darkstalkers game would make me nut infinitely
[1:58:04] <%barkon345> well in this game any touch is a dead character so yea that mind set makes sense
[1:58:12] <Man_in_the_Red> @fuqboislim Disney didnt cough up money and didnt play ball with Fox, on top of expecting the game to be an MCU advertisement

[1:59:08] <%ChoculaUltra> not to mention the bad pr leading up to Infinite's release. That one interview where that guy said characters are just functions did nooooot help public perception after the first trailer dropped with the botched Chun Li face.
[1:59:11] <%Th3SmartAlec> SourPls
[1:59:22] <SeedTabulous> hearing vergil's theme is just monkaS personified
[1:59:24] <%FuqBoiSlim> that's tuff. I remember hearing Disney fucking with Fox before they bought them out. Same reason why the Inhumans got pushed everywhere?
[1:59:26] <kei_ar_> i missed my ciynter
[1:59:29] <+antthefool> MAHVEL BABAYYYY
[1:59:29] <kei_ar_> counter
[1:59:32] <thatangryguyofde> mvci: People don't care about the characters. They are just functions lytEYESWIP
[1:59:50] <Man_in_the_Red> @choculaultra they did the best with what Disney gave them, the faces thing on the otherhand couldve been handled better before footage
[1:59:51] <itwebb85> GET MOTIVATED WHITE BOI
[1:59:52] <+PhysicsLB> hey woolie, WHEN'S MAH-oh nevermind
[1:59:52] <%barkon345> a new dark stalkers would not sell at all.
[1:59:52] <+Jaysky> ChoculaUltra I bet in his head that was him helping by saying they just needed to make good characters it didn't matter who they were
[2:00:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> mvci plays really well, i hate the stones, most of the cast is boring, and it visually looks awful
[2:00:11] <@Menitta> I am super gonna lose lol
[2:00:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> parsec?
[2:00:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> if you could get a new franchise to get a fighting game what would it be?
[2:00:17] <%ChoculaUltra> @Jaysky oh I totally understood where he was coming from, it's just that his delivery and phrasing was just bad for optics
[2:00:31] <%ChoculaUltra> @Man_in_the_Red yeah, Disney pretty much shoved the entire MCU roster down their throats
[2:00:33] <Man_in_the_Red> @captainpiledriver emulates local play through streaming
[2:00:39] <%CaptainPileDriver> huh
[2:00:39] <ISkyHunterI> the problem with MVCI is that is is a downgrade to MVC 3 in every single way
[2:00:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> seems interesting
[2:00:51] <+Jaysky> Except characters totally do matter to me. THe minute they said Phoenix Wright was it? Instant buy. Amatarasu? Hit me with more of that Clover shit.
[2:01:00] <%barkon345> MVCI plays amazingly and has the best online in any capcom fighter. but litteraly everything else about the game is garbage
[2:01:00] <Man_in_the_Red> ^
[2:01:15] <%FuqBoiSlim> yeah, from a spectator standpoint it's just not exciting
[2:01:28] <%Irridium> never even get a chance to see the lobby man LUL
[2:01:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> i hate the stones
[2:01:31] <+UberWolfman> I'll continue to support MVCI as a MH main
[2:01:33] <NotHereToStream> monster hunter was pretty cool in mvci tho
[2:01:33] <%ChoculaUltra> dropping the comic/cel shade look was a bad bad choice imo.
[2:01:33] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:01:36] <%CaptainPileDriver> i hate the stones so much in mvci
[2:01:38] <alephalpha> the plays amazingly is arguable depending ont atsts but it's indeed good it's all on the look and missing characters
[2:01:39] <%Superbro64> rip zero :(
[2:01:45] <Heefnoff> Yeah man y’all should use Parsec
[2:01:46] <ISkyHunterI> also the stones were shit + only 2 characters
[2:01:46] <+radiosanchezz> what platform are they playing on?
[2:01:46] <%FuqBoiSlim> WEB BALL REALITY STONE
[2:01:47] <WakeUpThrow> I mean, it's a crossover fighter at the end of the day. Characters are always the main focus in them.

[2:02:29] <Man_in_the_Red> @doplghost sell your soul, get Windows 10
[2:02:31] <%barkon345> so pretty much everything capcom had control over in MVCI was amazing and everything Disney pulled the reigns on sucked balls
[2:02:38] <pipboy344> Okay
[2:02:38] <+UberWolfman> Silence fan LUL
[2:02:38] <+MrAtheGreat> “I need more danger” is a very dante quote now that I think about it
[2:02:40] <%ChoculaUltra> but don't quote me on it, Woolie throws the schedule up on twitter on monday after the podcast usually
[2:02:44] <@Menitta> Sorry
[2:02:51] <huskarl_zap> gottamute you he was bout to drop the nword
[2:02:56] <Man_in_the_Red> @barkon345 minus Capcom's roster being the MVCI dregs
[2:02:58] <huskarl_zap> also that sounds like malwar
[2:03:01] <%Cozy90> parsec is dope
[2:03:02] <huskarl_zap> e
[2:03:03] <ISkyHunterI> getting a controller to work can be buggy and annoying but otherwise amazing programe
[2:03:23] <+bendatron> he does indeed throw up the schedule on twitter at the beginning of each week
[2:03:27] <%barkon345> I always wondered what this game would be like if X-Factor wasn't in it
[2:03:38] <%Wool> @barkon345 that game is called Tatsunoko vs Capcom
[2:03:50] <%cobalt_phoenix_> he ususally does ttyd tue and thu, then wed is current V game (at least how it's been the past few weeks). but idk if he mentioned anything different, like others said tho you can check his twitter on monday for the planned schedule
[2:03:51] <alephalpha> the fact it messes with fram data so much is crazy for a powere dup state
[2:04:03] <thatangryguyofde> an ultimately less come back blow out game

[2:04:22] <Bustahhwulf> ryanlv chun stall WeirdChamp
[2:04:37] <%barkon345> @Man_in_the_Red nut I wonder if that was becasue Disney gave capcom barley any time to make the game so they had to rehash models form MVC3.
[2:04:41] <%barkon345> but I
[2:04:42] <@Menitta> This game is so much NotLikeThis
[2:04:42] <kei_ar_> thats me with wesker
[2:04:54] <alephalpha> there woulkd also be less hey I'mma get out of jai by canceling into xfactor to deal with what you were doing
[2:04:56] <kei_ar_> i really want my task to be top but virgil wesker is so goood
[2:04:56] <%MarkTarkus> Hey I have a quarter, I'm up next
[2:05:28] <%ChoculaUltra> "I got winner"
[2:05:33] <Man_in_the_Red> those models look very different to me, Capcom had a LOT of better choices for carry over from 3
[2:05:38] <thatangryguyofde> without xfactor its just a plain sequel to mvc2 lytSNEER
[2:05:44] <Man_in_the_Red> if they reused models
[2:05:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> what does x factor do
[2:06:00] <@Menitta> I really like Chun Li's moves but she feels super different compared to everyone else
[2:06:15] <alephalpha> bbtag most of the character shave interesting teams they can work with and od interesting stuff then you got yu adachi and yumi just all over the place
[2:06:15] <kei_ar_> the muda muda

[2:06:24] <peanutdot007> Nothing is as sick as air combos
[2:06:24] <geesehoward226> Was just playing this lmao
[2:06:25] <+Jaysky> I'm surprised I'm not seeing more Wesker. I recall seeing him be common place in the past, or was that just the original MvC3?
[2:06:31] <Man_in_the_Red> @cobalt_phoenix_ makes 1 character as good as 3 stacked on top of eachother
[2:06:35] <+antthefool> S W I S S C H E E S E
[2:06:35] <alephalpha> original mvc3 yeah
[2:06:40] <Man_in_the_Red> at least it feels like it
[2:06:46] <%Travelboy22> Travelboy22 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:06:47] <alephalpha> wesker wa salso overrated in early mvc3
[2:06:57] <%ChoculaUltra> X-factor is a damage and speed boost. Frames/combos that you wouldn't normally be able to pull together just work.
[2:06:59] <ISkyHunterI> wesker was mad fun
[2:07:02] <+Jaysky> FOOT FOOT DI
[2:07:04] <alephalpha> he's good but he's not up there witht he top tiers
[2:07:12] <+xerotwo> BUTTER GUN
[2:07:12] <+Jaysky> Snooooooof
[2:07:13] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh wow that sounds.... interesting
[2:07:20] <thatangryguyofde> Wesker is basic but also effective
[2:07:21] <%cobalt_phoenix_> mainly the speed
[2:07:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> there's only 3 tiers in hyper fighters, the "no actual good reason to not play them because they go well with anyone and are just goo" the "pretty solid with a lot of people and if it weren't for those perfect bois, then i'd be on top" then there's "i'm here for that one gimmick that makes this one specific setup fucking dirty and hype
[2:07:32] <%barkon345> @cobalt_phoenix_ its a burst and a free cancel that gives your characters a giant buff to damage and defense based on how many characters are left on your team
[2:07:43] <%MarkTarkus> Not many characters have normals that can otg
[2:07:45] <%ChoculaUltra> yeah, it lets you do some nutty ass shit. Characters like Vergil and Wesker go from deadly to absurd.

[2:08:34] <KeiPrime> sigma
[2:08:37] <%ChoculaUltra> what I do like about DBFZ is that with recent patches, more and more characters are just viable. Like the lowest tier rating right now is like B-.
[2:08:41] <jase__x> spiderman and Captain America

[2:09:04] <%Irridium> I'll be real I hard passed on infinite. just had no character that interested me.
[2:09:05] <+Jaysky> Oh, MvCI
[2:09:09] <+Jaysky> Haven't played
[2:09:12] <alephalpha> @ChoculaUltra I think the biggest problem is all the character sstrongest things ar ein the universal emchanics and even beyond that many were already very similar
[2:09:21] <+bendatron> i found gamora was super sick

[2:09:48] <%ChoculaUltra> @alephalpha oh for sure - all characters sort of just are the same person with a few gimmicks with how universally powerful dragon rush and chase are
[2:09:49] <+antthefool> Yo that akuma got fucked
[2:09:49] <+Kilik_> God Akuma is made of paper
[2:09:50] <alephalpha> I'd prefer having less character be good if the characters that were good were good in different ways
[2:09:51] <WakeUpThrow> I thought Thor was surprisingly fu as well
[2:09:55] <+bendatron> jedah was cool
[2:09:58] <%Solidnick18> yep

[2:10:25] <Axonn1018> Thor, Nemesis and Ghost Rider got buffs I wish were in UMvC3
[2:10:31] <%chll0ne> mcu really ruined marvel for me
[2:10:31] <+bendatron> jedah and ultron were also probably the best looking base game characters

[2:20:57] <Superblooms> i feel like that's why i can't get into fighting games. you just get combo'd into oblivion, and it doesn't feel good.
[2:20:58] <%ggbhtg> Co commentary, of course
[2:21:13] <Heefnoff> Nah that’s just this game @superblooms
[2:21:20] <%Doplghost> thats why you have to get good at neutral and when you first play to learn
[2:21:21] <Heefnoff> They’re not all like this, this is the exception, not the rule
[2:21:21] <+BusinessGiraffe> I wonder which one is woolie Kappa

[2:22:48] <%Solidnick18> Nice
[2:23:00] <%ChoculaUltra> oh damn, is it really Cockney? I apologize
[2:23:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> I tried skullgirls a while back, it taught me a few basics of fighting games i didn't know since im clueless to fighting games. but it feels like i need something slower to ease in. any reccomendations chat?
[2:23:25] <Heefnoff> @cobalt_phoenix_ Granblue Fantasy Versus
[2:23:32] <+nerdblase> Divekick.
[2:23:37] <Heefnoff> Veeeeeeeery different game, but gives you a grasp on the basics
[2:23:40] <Lemonbop> samurai shodown
[2:23:42] <%ChoculaUltra> Granblue, Samurai Shodown, Divekick,
[2:23:44] <$geesehoward226> I personally started with KOF which might sound yikes but it taught me complex motions and footsys
[2:23:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> hm ok, thanks
[2:24:02] <%SirGO0SE> granblue has great pacing to it and everything is reactable
[2:24:11] <%ggbhtg> A game with characters you like, would also be neat
[2:24:13] <Heefnoff> If you want to get into a game similar to this but a bit easier, you can go DBFZ
[2:24:17] <$geesehoward226> Granblue looks quality
[2:24:22] <+xerotwo> O O P A H H dooddoom
[2:24:23] <Heefnoff> But based on what you’re describing, Granblue.
[2:24:28] <%ggbhtg> FGs are tough, so play with characters you like
[2:24:30] <roada_rolla_da> Under Night has a real good tutorial too
[2:24:30] <%barkon345> fantasy strike is litteraly deesigned to teach begginers how to play fighting game
[2:24:34] <Heefnoff> And yeah if you don’t love any of the characters it’s tough to get in
[2:24:44] <%Doplghost> dont worry theres enough Gokus to make a team
[2:24:46] <%HeroVersusOfficial> Look at that fair ass character lol
[2:24:47] <%barkon345> but that game is super slow and very basic
[2:24:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> gotcha, thanks again
[2:24:55] <Kitsunerasu> KI also has a really great tutorial
[2:24:57] <%ChoculaUltra> there's enough gokus to make 2 teams LUL
[2:25:00] <$geesehoward226> I watched this, and some old stuff but what got me into fighting games was Fatal Fury 3 lololol
[2:25:03] <%ggbhtg> I will play Filia-Squigly when I learn Skullgirls, and play them TIL I DIIIIIE
[2:25:03] <luckysteak> huh, I leave and come back to the exact same combos
[2:25:12] <%Doplghost> give me 9 Gokus
[2:25:14] <%SirGO0SE> yeah actually if you want a real beginners game that you can teach someone else to play with you in like 10 minutes Fantasy Strike is great
[2:25:19] <%SirGO0SE> good call @barkon345
[2:25:20] <+MrAtheGreat> weight are off!!

[2:32:19] <+MrAtheGreat> Decided to win it himself off screen
[2:32:19] <Bustahhwulf> woolie cooked
[2:32:27] <Bustahhwulf> reggie now owns the channel
[2:32:28] <WakeUpThrow> Still the GOAT
[2:32:31] <%Doplghost> newer fighting games are too fair
[2:32:32] <alephalpha> yesterdya
[2:32:33] <%SirGO0SE> thats bullshit you were sweatin' bullets earlier with those stinky underwear
[2:32:35] <Heefnoff> What an amazing game
[2:32:37] <%ggbhtg> I wish I at least understood what was going on while watching Marvel LUL
[2:32:38] <alephalpha> rev 2 is pretty good
[2:32:43] <Heefnoff> Guys, please keep playing this on your own time
[2:32:45] <%Solidnick18> ggxrd probably
[2:32:46] <%Gabranth305> Marvel definitely has a way to make you SWEAT lile crazy
[2:32:47] <DeathByPoke7> we need more x factor Kappa
[2:32:49] <Heefnoff> It’s too good, and it needs you right now
[2:32:55] <$geesehoward226> Marvel and Garou make me lose pounds in sweat
[2:32:56] <alephalpha> @Solidnick18 ye
[2:33:02] <%SirGO0SE> ;)
[2:33:05] <+MrAtheGreat> Hey Woolie, is this the beginning for the second When’s Mahvel push?
[2:33:06] <Bustahhwulf> i finna walk forward back press 5b foosies the game LUL
[2:33:11] <Heefnoff> Use Parsec and keep going
[2:33:16] <%HeroVersusOfficial> There's a lot of stuff going into the backend of things, but once stuff gets off the ground we'll probably need things like event staff, QA, more coders, artists, and so on.
[2:33:17] <+xerotwo> doodCrazy
[2:33:20] <Heefnoff> UMVC3 is just the best
[2:33:24] <roada_rolla_da> They should play Garou again since they put rollback in it a while back
[2:33:31] <%HeroVersusOfficial> But until then we're running tight staff and moving along as we can

[2:33:38] <@Menitta> Its hard to beat brawl
[2:33:40] <%Doplghost> why fix what is not broken
[2:33:40] <%Wool> Brawl netcode is nightmare fuel
[2:33:40] <%Solidnick18> ummm
[2:33:42] <%RocketBarrel> Brawl is the absolute worst
[2:33:50] <%Irridium> brawl was something else even in its time. christ.
[2:33:52] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> has any human played a good online match of KoFXIII? I refuse to believe it tbh
[2:33:53] <@Menitta> Wait that happens?!
[2:33:57] <$geesehoward226> Was Wools referring to new Sam Showdown?

[2:34:09] <WakeUpThrow> Somersault is right, SoulCal4's is ASS
[2:34:10] <Heefnoff> Good to know. Makes sense. If you ever need anything done, paid or unpaid, I got you @heroversusofficial
[2:34:14] <%ggbhtg> did the AI drop start in Brawl or Smash 4?
[2:34:20] <Man_in_the_Red> console 13 is the worst, PC is alright
[2:34:20] <%Wool> Brawl netcode crawled so Melee rollback could run
[2:34:22] <%RocketBarrel> Smash 4.
[2:34:27] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> oh I never played the steam version. Console ones might as well not had online
[2:34:28] <%HeroVersusOfficial> Atually whenever I'm featured, I'll probably be talking on stream here and answering some questions if you guys have them

[2:34:46] <%kyh9> Sakurai knows what the players want: he just says that's wrong
[2:35:02] <%kyh9> Sakurai legitimately spites the Smash Competitive community
[2:35:14] <%ggbhtg> "What's this dank garbage?!" - Woolie's cousin, probably
[2:35:16] <+MrAtheGreat> The ragequit is Waaaaaaay better
[2:35:24] <%Irridium> @kyh9 I mean... considering recent events he probably feels real smug right now

[2:48:15] <Ragnorok64> oh
[2:48:18] <%HeroVersusOfficial> @WoolieVersus In terms of "anti-air", a full held dropkick will pull you out of the range of most attacks while your long leg hitbox will hit the enemy. The downside is it loses to advancing moves and higher altitude elbow drop.
[2:48:46] <+MrAtheGreat> Anti-b-air, you mean?
[2:48:54] <alephalpha> you right

[2:51:59] <fredan31> sorry i just got hear wheres the game audio?
[2:52:08] <%HeroVersusOfficial> @WoolieVersus It's not just about aggression, it's about timing. You can forward or back tech by hitting forward or back when you touch the ground, and can immediately go into attacks or second jump. It can give you a burst of momentum but you run the risk that your tech will get tapped. Don't be afraid to back tech to give yourself some space.

[2:55:04] <+barristerofthebar> Having the life bar be hits is so good
[2:55:07] <alephalpha> it looks really good for something that's bearly an alpha
[2:55:08] <Sulfur_Boride> They have yet to implement SFX? I assume it's just like an Alpha or something?
[2:55:17] <empanadadejq> it is
[2:55:21] <%SirGO0SE> well its bearly an alpha
[2:55:31] <huskarl_zap> @kidkaiser23 A goyim moment to be surw

[2:56:39] <CrimsonGargoyle> LUL
[2:56:44] <%HeroVersusOfficial> @WoolieVersus Just to note, moves like body splash have persistent hitboxes. Don't be afraid to throw them out on oki.
[2:56:45] <huskarl_zap> bearly legal combo
[2:56:53] <+barristerofthebar> So this basically Divekick 2.0, huh?
[2:56:53] <KidKaiser23> What are some of y’all favorite Bear moments in Media?
[2:57:02] <+MrAtheGreat> BEAR THIS GRUDGE
[2:57:03] <KidKaiser23> I’m very fond of the Bear Debate from The Office
[2:57:09] <%robobeau> THE NEW TO THE OLD

[2:57:17] <KidKaiser23> And the BroTeamPill video
[2:57:17] <+Froyuken> @KidKaiser23 Lots of stuff in the cartoon We Bare Bears.

[2:58:55] <+MrAtheGreat> @huskarl_zap You mean back-bairs?
[2:59:02] <huskarl_zap> yee
[2:59:05] <+gambit_gamble> this game ain't gont a down 2?
[2:59:23] <huskarl_zap> this game uses smash terminology
[2:59:28] <%SirGO0SE> i think its more focused on bairs
[2:59:41] <fredan31> a
[2:59:46] <%HeroVersusOfficial> @WoolieVersus Just to note, the answer to a body splash is a back tech, since the splash will miss and the landing lag will allow tou a drop kick. The oki comes into predicting your opponents moves and overcoming them (since if you don't chase, theyre basically whiffing in front of you). Also, no pun intended, Bair is a good button.
[2:59:51] <KidKaiser23> @mrathegreat Your puns are Pandaring

[3:02:16] <Sulfur_Boride> Eyy, Boo-Boo. You're gonna get more than just a boo-boo.
[3:02:22] <+zed11111111> @WoolieVersus you've probably answered this before but what do you think of the new Subhuman with the fixed mixing and vocals?
[3:02:28] <Superblooms> what's this song? it's great
[3:02:29] <+Froyuken> More like pawsies.
[3:02:35] <%Cozy90> reggie the god of bears
[3:02:46] <%HeroVersusOfficial> @WoolieVersus One last general tip, if you want some good schmovement, a quick press back into long hold forward-back can give you a low advancing bear claw. Utilize different hold times to get differne tmovement options.
[3:02:51] <KidKaiser23> Ice cold tech, Hearts turned polar by war
[3:02:53] <%Solidnick18> it's good stuff
[3:03:05] <Mr_Strut> Quality ass...music
[3:03:36] <+MrAtheGreat> There needs to be a bear called reggie in this game, tag-line: loves his bear feet.

[3:06:04] <%HeroVersusOfficial> @WoolieVersus One last general tip, if you want some good schmovement, a quick press back into long hold forward-back can give you a low advancing bear claw. Utilize different hold times to get differnet movement options.

[3:08:34] <%notgarza> How can I find this playlist? It's soo good
[3:08:35] <%Josef_Stryker> What other types of bears are there?

[3:08:52] <ChansonNoire> red panda pixie char
[3:08:53] <%jiggy_snipe> KappaHD
[3:08:55] <%Josef_Stryker> Are we gonna count Red Pandas?
[3:08:56] <%Cozy90> @barristerofthebar i cant tell if your joking or not but that sounds awesome
[3:09:06] <+Froyuken> Name the panda Pandamonium.
[3:09:07] <huskarl_zap> can you only jump?
[3:09:19] <+glassesaregod> Jebaited
[3:09:20] <+Froyuken> That one's free @HeroVersusOfficial !
[3:09:23] <californaya> that was brilliant
[3:09:25] <%HeroVersusOfficial> @WoolieVersus If you tech into a move while it's hitting you (like body splash with it's persistent hitbox) you'll tech INTO the hit. Techs don't have invincibility. You can use this to your advantage on a trigger-happy opponent to make them think twice. As I said, all about timing.
[3:09:30] <KidKaiser23> Call the Red Panda “Redeye” and have him be Rabid
[3:09:32] <+barristerofthebar> @Cozy90 Not joking. from a loading screen

[3:12:32] <KidKaiser23> A Kuma is the strongest shit I’ve seen all day, and I saw Pat Izuna Drop a child

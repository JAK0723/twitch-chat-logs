[0:16:29] <+jiggy_snipe> there not really in the business of sponsoring other people's stuff

[0:34:30] <%CptnCampy61> His up the nose songs
[0:34:38] <DesertPenguin> This is hilarious. Last night Girlfriend Reviews was shitting on the Joker movie for a good 45 minutes LUL
[0:34:42] <$jake5713> Correction: THE COMICS are the shit. the movie was eh and the show is amazing.
[0:35:00] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @Lion_kun The songs he used feel right with the situation
[0:35:16] <speedwagen> @DesertPenguin I need to see this
[0:35:18] <ColbyBryant> We talking watchmen?
[0:35:24] <%jinking79> watch the movie in theaters didn't notice the Blue Dong till friend point it out
[0:35:24] <tearfuldevil> snyder loved the aesthetic of the watchmen comic but he didn't get the themes and plot AT ALL
[0:35:30] <DesertPenguin> See what? Watchmen?
[0:35:48] <$BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[0:35:49] <DesertPenguin> V for Vendetta was done well. Who made that?
[0:35:51] <%afronooch> yeah watchmen
[0:36:00] <ColbyBryant> The watchmen book is 4D while the movie is 2D
[0:36:02] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> The GN is short!
[0:36:03] <$BallerSwagBro9k> OH GOD
[0:36:11] <$BallerSwagBro9k> ITS LIKE THE GOT AUDIOBOOKS
[0:36:20] <%jinking79> glad my English class in high school had the watchman comic for us to read
[0:36:23] <$BallerSwagBro9k> GRRM does all the voices
[0:36:31] <$BallerSwagBro9k> and hes NOT a good VA LUL
[0:36:36] <DesertPenguin> Oh yea, the comic within the comic
[0:36:53] <$jake5713> It's not that long a read! it's only 12 issues.
[0:37:02] <Pappajimbo> pirate comics baby
[0:37:02] <Avatarconner> I only recently read the Watchmen Graphic Novel, I got it for Christmas, and after reading it? It's pretty clear why the movie isn't a successful adaptation.
[0:37:03] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> @ballerswagbro9k Listen to the Roy Dotrice version of the audiobook, he does it well
[0:37:11] <Quigsies> GoT audiobooks by Roy Dotrice are good
[0:37:23] <%jinking79> it's a good read
[0:37:32] <DesertPenguin> Now Reggie gets it
[0:37:42] <DesertPenguin> I saw Watchmen in IMAX
[0:37:50] <%Lion_kun> It's before Alan Moore lost his mind.
[0:37:56] <%jinking79> don't forget the Watchmen Videogame
[0:38:14] <masterfire23> ah man i saw avatar in theaters
[0:38:22] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> I'm in the minority where I didn't like the pirate comic and was glad the movie cut them lol
[0:38:26] <DesertPenguin> Avatar in theatres was as good as people say
[0:38:35] <DesertPenguin> 3D used to make depth, not have things pop out at you. Genius
[0:38:57] <+Loinclothiclese> @DesertPenguin i went to see it in theaters with friends i got my money back right after we all did

[0:39:02] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[0:39:03] <%CptnCampy61> I personally thought the book was overrated as hell. But I haven’t read it in a really long time so I could be wrong
[0:39:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> BWOOOOOOOOONG
[0:39:13] <$BallerSwagBro9k> HOOOOOOOOOOOORNNNNNSSSSSSSSSS
[0:39:19] <%Lion_kun> Nolan's another hack director with his cheap shortcuts.
[0:39:26] <DesertPenguin> Everything I've read about TENET is that the music is unnecessarily loud and it's hard to hear dialogue sometimes
[0:39:27] <%jinking79> Bullets from the future
[0:39:38] <T_Sasquatch> @lion_kun wow hack? Really
[0:39:41] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> interstellar gave me a mirgane
[0:39:41] <%Lion_kun> Nolan has only made one good movie.

[0:41:33] <%sjay449> The show or the movie?
[0:41:41] <Torgue_1> Movie
[0:41:46] <@Menitta> My theater opened just for tenet
[0:41:54] <%Lion_kun> Nolan is a great filmmaker. His practical effects are excellent. But he xcannot write characters to save his life.
[0:41:58] <%Livelinne> lytOMG
[0:42:01] <+Loinclothiclese> @Mkingston i saw 2049 in theaters that shit was fantastic

[0:42:08] <Torgue_1> A Dame to Kill For
[0:42:17] <masterfire23> you read the comic then watch the tv series and then you've consumed content
[0:42:17] <%Lion_kun> Nolan characters are emotionless alien creatures.

[0:44:22] <%Livelinne> psa3guy psaCanada psaCanada
[0:44:27] <sonofthedeepsouth> 300 is cool
[0:44:35] <OldManDeckardCain> the parody of 300 is much better than the original LUL
[0:44:35] <+Mkingston> 300 is lame
[0:44:44] <Pappajimbo> 300 works ott
[0:44:45] <sonofthedeepsouth> 300 is okay
[0:44:47] <%jinking79> Meet the Spartans
[0:44:47] <emeraldskrull> not the zombie movie?
[0:44:47] <$BallerSwagBro9k> THIS. IS. SPARTAAAAAAAAAA Kreygasm Kreygasm
[0:44:49] <%afronooch> 300 is alright. its a fun watch
[0:44:52] <Torgue_1> What about Dawn of the Dead?
[0:44:54] <%ChoculaUltra> "Snydering" sounds so sinister.
[0:44:57] <%Livelinne> watch for the me. e
[0:44:58] <+Loinclothiclese> @KaiserMario hes not gona get anywhere in pyre
[0:45:03] <%Livelinne> memes
[0:45:06] <sonofthedeepsouth> he has no power
[0:45:10] <+Mkingston> Dawn of the Dead was good
[0:45:17] <T_Sasquatch> Anyone ever watch "Meet the Spartans" LUL
[0:45:19] <+shootbang_exe> Snyder is all style no substance at best
[0:45:22] <+Loinclothiclese> oh god not sucker punch
[0:45:22] <%emperordread> Sucker Punch was SO bad
[0:45:24] <$BallerSwagBro9k> OH NOOOOOOOOOOO
[0:45:27] <$BallerSwagBro9k> WOOLIE DONT
[0:45:28] <sonofthedeepsouth> shut up watchmen roscharch was great
[0:45:29] <Pappajimbo> oof
[0:45:30] <+Loinclothiclese> of course you do min OF FUCKING COURSE YOU DO GOTA PROTECT
[0:45:31] <brunoberserk> sucker punch is really bad
[0:45:33] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Sucker Punch is peak Snyder
[0:45:37] <@Menitta> LUL
[0:45:37] <%ChoculaUltra> I had a friend unironically try to argue that Sucker Punch had a good storyline.
[0:45:38] <%Livelinne> woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:45:39] <sonofthedeepsouth> SUCKER PUNCH SUCKS
[0:45:42] <+Loinclothiclese> minh*
[0:45:51] <%emperordread> Don't hurt Reggir with sucker punch, let me love the watchmen comics instead
[0:45:52] <%Livelinne> woolieKICKDAD woolieKICKDAD woolieKICKDAD
[0:45:55] <misterurbanthelegend> like Afro Samurai
[0:45:56] <@Menitta> Just play FFXIII
[0:45:56] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> its awful
[0:46:00] <%jinking79> Sneak into the Movie to watch it free
[0:46:04] <+Loinclothiclese> who would have guessed minh likes sucker punch big wow LUL
[0:46:11] <T_Sasquatch> I like sucker punch when its not in prison reality
[0:46:21] <+Copycat_Joker> This is my first stream I've legitimately tried to watch of Woolie's. Do they normally start with 45mins of talking? I'm here for it, I just wanna know lol
[0:46:22] <+Mkingston> @Menitta oh God no
[0:46:25] <%sjay449> Talking about Sucker Punch in an LP session for a game by Sucker Punch
[0:46:30] <@Menitta> I saw that. I’m at 33
[0:46:31] <$jake5713> 300 was fun, no lie, but not as cool as everybody said. Endgame is god tier though in terms of production and the sheer time and integrating storylines from 21 other movies into something cohesive and successful.
[0:46:32] <+jiggy_snipe> bad film cool music videos Kappa
[0:46:35] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> ye
[0:46:35] <sonofthedeepsouth> SO IT'S AN AMV
[0:46:39] <+Loinclothiclese> @Copycat_Joker sorta always depends whats being talked about but for the most part yea
[0:46:42] <%Livelinne> watch animeeee lytKILLGOKU
[0:47:05] <T_Sasquatch> Its metaphor is so horrendous
[0:47:10] <DesertPenguin> Sucker Punch was the most "music video" in that all of the delusion scenes are literally music videos
[0:47:27] <+Mkingston> David Hayter wrote the Screenplay for Watchmen
[0:47:30] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[0:47:31] <+shootbang_exe> Snyder's take on Rorschach is wild to me as a comic fan
[0:47:32] <sonofthedeepsouth> MINH
[0:47:32] <%SaiyanShoto> The worst part of Snyder is his fanboys
[0:47:33] <%CptnCampy61> Sucker punch was god awful
[0:47:34] <DesertPenguin> When I saw all of these movies I didn't know about the comics at all so there's that
[0:47:38] <ColbyBryant> Read the manga
[0:47:40] <@Menitta> Please be excited for the Snyder cut
[0:47:50] <%Solidnick18> my burninggggg bladdde
[0:47:58] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @CptnCampy61 The worst part of anything are its fans LUL
[0:47:58] <%Lion_kun> Read it on stream.
[0:48:06] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Fuck Snyder movies, watch Amagi Brilliant Park instead
[0:48:07] <DesertPenguin> I know it wn't save it, I just want to see his original ideas
[0:48:14] <sonofthedeepsouth> BASED CRAZY PEOPLE
[0:48:14] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:48:18] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @CanadianAnimatorGuy THIS IS THE WAY
[0:48:21] <%SaiyanShoto> As a Superman fan I hate Snyder for what he did to him
[0:48:23] <%jinking79> man fuck the Snyder Cut die hard fan
[0:48:35] <%Solidnick18> yeah they did
[0:48:36] <Prevot> venom was SO bad tho
[0:48:41] <$jake5713> Opposite example, everyone's seen Jurassic Park yet I don't know a single person who read the books.
[0:48:41] <emeraldskrull> that sounds like a very bad thing
[0:48:47] <%Solidnick18> venom was some jank
[0:48:47] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Shazam and Venom sucked hard tho
[0:48:48] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @sonofthedeepsouth
[0:48:51] <DesertPenguin> Venom was okay
[0:48:52] <%MacabreOpus> Nolan fanboys are worse than Snyder ones due to them believeing they are above all else, not accepting any flaws whatsoever
[0:48:57] <T_Sasquatch> DC killed Superman in its SECOND MOVIE LUL
[0:48:59] <+Mkingston> Shazam was fun
[0:49:01] <%Livelinne> Venom's trailer bait was eeeeeh...
[0:49:01] <DesertPenguin> Venom wasn't a blockbuster but it wasn't overtly awful
[0:49:06] <@Menitta> I had so much fun seeing Venom
[0:49:12] <%Solidnick18> i liked venom that's about it but hey look carnage
[0:49:21] <@Menitta> Idk if it was good but I had fun watching it
[0:49:22] <sonofthedeepsouth> Only the two blade movies were good. the only good superhero movies of the 90s and early 00
[0:49:23] <T_Sasquatch> Venom is great unironically
[0:49:25] <+ManOfReason> Venom is a buddy cop movie
[0:49:28] <%SaiyanShoto> @t_sasquatch Don’t remind me woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:49:33] <misterurbanthelegend> Darkseid looks like terrax from Silver Surfer in the snyder cut.
[0:49:35] <masterfire23> i watched like 20 mins of venom thwn i forgot about it
[0:49:35] <T_Sasquatch> There's heart in venom
[0:49:35] <%jinking79> Venom beating the car alarm
[0:49:36] <%chosenjuan42> Venom is fun
[0:49:40] <%sjay449> Venom is "The Room" of Superhero movies
[0:49:45] <%SaiyanShoto> The best part of Venom are when Eddie and Venom are talking
[0:49:50] <%chosenjuan42> Venom has always been goofy
[0:49:50] <sonofthedeepsouth> LETS WATCH THE FIRST BLADE MOVIE
[0:49:53] <%Livelinne> Tom Hardy good ungabunga woolieSMUG
[0:49:59] <%jinking79> Scene with Venom and Eddie best part of the movie
[0:49:59] <Prevot> @SaiyanShoto more like the only good part
[0:50:02] <%MacabreOpus> Let there be CARNAGE
[0:50:07] <ColbyBryant> Venom was a 2006 movie
[0:50:12] <+Copycat_Joker> I don't know why people want a Synder Justice League. There is not point in saving a dumpster fire. Even if you put the flames out, all you're saving is trash.
[0:50:13] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @Livelinne The man has a single facial emotion LUL
[0:50:16] <%chosenjuan42> yay TTYD
[0:50:28] <%SaiyanShoto> @prevot you’re not wrong lol
[0:50:36] <+Loinclothiclese> @Livelinne fuck you hes great
[0:50:38] <misterurbanthelegend> Venom is bad to the point where its funny as fuck
[0:50:43] <%Livelinne> @ballerswagbro9k that's what I like from him LUL
[0:50:49] <@Menitta> That mural is so good
[0:50:50] <@akuda_bar> npnp
[0:50:56] <T_Sasquatch> I hate dc sooo much LUL
[0:50:56] <+Loinclothiclese> @Livelinne mad max was awesome
[0:51:00] <@akuda_bar> i was looking for an adequate emoji but i couldnt' find it
[0:51:01] <+Chili_Daddy> we need more movies like sharknado
[0:51:24] <@akuda_bar> magfestRoar magfestRoar there it is
[0:51:28] <%Livelinne> @loinclothiclese MMFR is my life's best movie. don't get me wrong
[0:51:33] <Prevot> one day we'll get live action Beyond with Clint Eastwood as old Bruce
[0:51:36] <Prevot> or not
[0:51:48] <%chosenjuan42> Venom is not supposed to be a cannibal. At least not Eddie or Flash. Gargan however totally down with eating people
[0:51:59] <+Loinclothiclese> @Livelinne i want more hardy grunts
[0:52:18] <%Livelinne> @loinclothiclese yeye woolieGASM
[0:52:27] <%chosenjuan42> Eddie figured out eating chocolate avoids it's craving for brains
[0:52:28] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @chosenjuan42 Some versions of Eddie totally ate people
[0:52:33] <%SaiyanShoto> @chosenjuan42 in his first appearances he did talk about eating brains
[0:52:41] <Prevot> I'm a weird Venom hipster where I don't care about him at all if its not Eddie
[0:52:50] <DesertPenguin> What story are they talking about now?
[0:52:54] <Prevot> if the symbiote is not on peter or eddie I don't give a fuck about it
[0:53:04] <sonofthedeepsouth> Is there any good books on the african slaver kingdoms?
[0:53:24] <DesertPenguin> Because the system is actively trying to shove that stuff under the rug
[0:53:35] <%SaiyanShoto> @prevot big same, I only like Flash venom cause the costume is sick but Venom always has to be Eddie
[0:53:42] <%chosenjuan42> @saiyanshoto He did talk about it but he has only ate one brain and regretted it immediately then figured out chocolate was a good replacement
[0:54:09] <%chosenjuan42> Ultimate venom in ultimate universe was a complete cannibal
[0:54:30] <Prevot> isnt ultimate one of those versions thats not even an alien
[0:54:35] <$BallerSwagBro9k> PFFF LUL
[0:54:43] <+jiggy_snipe> purify the savages Kappa

[0:55:46] <Leafboi125> Power ranger
[0:55:50] <%Lion_kun> Its power rangers
[0:55:52] <%SaiyanShoto> I remember I had a power rangers text tone and when it went off at a Taco Bell a bunch of girls went “Oh my god! You have the Kim Possible sound!”
[0:55:52] <sonofthedeepsouth> force em to breed
[0:55:58] <+jiggy_snipe> I'm 30 and I immediately went to Kim Possible even tho I saw Power Rangers
[0:56:02] <T_Sasquatch> I grew up with both. Its still kp LUL
[0:56:08] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @T_Sasquatch Same LUL
[0:56:21] <%sjay449> Power Rangers in Space is the real shit
[0:56:27] <%Lion_kun> KP is a different tone
[0:56:32] <%afronooch> literal objectification
[0:56:34] <sonofthedeepsouth> Money>>>>>>Christ
[0:56:36] <%SaiyanShoto> Honestly the Kim Possible and Power Rangers tone are kinda close lol
[0:56:37] <%Reverend_Roscoe> KP has fewer notes
[0:56:53] <%sjay449> "woolie talking about slavery and religon" Us: GO GO POWER RANGERS
[0:56:55] <$jake5713> 3/5ths of a person.
[0:56:56] <+Mkingston> They treated people like Pokemon.
[0:56:58] <masterfire23> sounded like KP though
[0:57:00] <+jiggy_snipe> you gotta justify you're crazy bs

[0:57:45] <+crazyd1amond97> whats the name of the book again?
[0:57:48] <%chosenjuan42> Fun fact:. 1v1 Venom has won most fights against Spider-Man. Spider has needed help from the fantastic 4 or other heroes to trap him most of the time.

[0:58:30] <+Copycat_Joker> Man, I didn't think I'd see the day people would mistake the MMPR communicator sound for the Kim Possible noise
[0:58:46] <T_Sasquatch> We've had this argument before LUL
[0:58:48] <$BallerSwagBro9k> HBO Watchmen was really really good
[0:58:51] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @Copycat_Joker this is the second time it's happened on stream

[0:58:52] <%Reverend_Roscoe> at least
[0:58:55] <+Copycat_Joker> christ
[0:59:01] <OldManDeckardCain> HBO watchmen was terrible
[0:59:08] <%afronooch> we don't talk about many things that make us lot bad down here
[0:59:13] <T_Sasquatch> Welcome to the education system LUL
[0:59:15] <%heartlesshealer> Tulsa riots, forced hysterectomies of Native Americans and latina women, lots of shit
[0:59:16] <ColbyBryant> Really makes you think
[0:59:19] <%SaiyanShoto> I’ve heard people say the HBO watchmen show is bad because it’s not Watchmen
[0:59:20] <masterfire23> wasn't HBO watchmen put on Hulu at one point?
[0:59:28] <%sjay449> No, HBO Watchmen is actually really good
[0:59:28] <$BallerSwagBro9k> USA only teaches about black peole during the Civil War and MLK
[0:59:32] <%MacabreOpus> HBO Watchmen was beautiful
[0:59:33] <+Mkingston> I heard it was great. Not seen it myself.
[0:59:35] <+Razputin217> America did nothing wrong Kappa
[0:59:35] <$BallerSwagBro9k> HBO WATCHMEN WAS GREAT
[0:59:39] <nvrwaker> woolie looking like he skinned a couch for that track suit
[0:59:41] <%sjay449> IT IS WATCHMEN
[0:59:44] <ColbyBryant> I’ve heard nothing but bad things

[0:59:56] <T_Sasquatch> I didn't learn about my own country's history in school but somehow learnt about Romulus and fucking remus
[0:59:56] <+jiggy_snipe> it's based in the universe tho
[1:00:04] <+shootbang_exe> A friend and I agree that most of the show is weird fanfic tier with a single incredible episode
[1:00:05] <DesertPenguin> Every time I look at that Dokapon hat I think of the Apex Legends logo
[1:00:07] <%chosenjuan42> lol
[1:00:09] <misterurbanthelegend> They lied saying Africans were just animals that could talk... shits fucked!
[1:00:10] <fatigued_driving> Learned about it from a short paragraph, had to do independent research to get the scope. I live in Oklahoma Cith
[1:00:12] <+jiggy_snipe> you could separate and nothing would really change tho
[1:00:14] <+Copycat_Joker> Even if we came to the middle of the road and agreed both noises sound the same, the tone for KP's communicator is heavier and the MMPR one is lighter. I don't know how the argument goes beyond that
[1:00:16] <fatigued_driving> City*
[1:00:21] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @T_Sasquatch it's very crucial info to learn

[1:01:16] <DesertPenguin> It's just last year's model. It's still top of the line
[1:01:20] <+mechslayer71> Why do you need it? It’s just objectively better than what you paid more for Kappa
[1:01:24] <%MacabreOpus> People I personally know did not know about the Tulsa massacre until viewing Watchmen, a fictitious show set in an alternate reality.

[2:29:31] <CappuccinoGuil> I EARNED my god damn confidence. WITH MONEY
[2:29:44] <%Solidnick18> ishikawa understands
[2:30:10] <%doomerskeletor13> This game loves painting anyone who’s against samurai as scum of the earth
[2:31:16] <CappuccinoGuil> @doomerskeletor13 gee, I wonder if perhaps the portrayal of Samurai depicted in Japan is some kind of revisionist history... nah, couldn't be it
[2:31:41] <%doomerskeletor13> It’s like when Kraven dresses up as Spider-Man and started killing criminals in Kravens Last Hunt
[2:31:48] <%doomerskeletor13> @cappuccinoguil Kappa
[2:31:54] <ofodojo> same with cowboy movies, when they were just settlers causing violence and killing natives
[2:32:11] <Admiral_PopnFresh> false flag attacks
[2:32:16] <BlackermanZX> well that one is on his throat
[2:32:18] <CappuccinoGuil> @ofodojo while we're at it, FUCK colonizers. Colombus was a bitch and Cabral was an idiot
[2:32:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie doesn't understand how arrows work
[2:32:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> depends where they hit tho
[2:32:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie arrows hurt
[2:32:38] <%CptnCampy61> Oooo boy
[2:32:38] <+vaporousTippler> Arrows are just chemicals.
[2:32:51] <@Commando_Joe> Horses have a lot of organs
[2:32:51] <+jiggy_snipe> it depends Woolie on where you are stabbed
[2:32:51] <ofodojo> @CappuccinoGuil true
[2:32:56] <%doomerskeletor13> It does depend on where they hit. My uncle shot like three arrows into a deer before it died
[2:32:58] <Admiral_PopnFresh> people bow hunt for CAPE BUFFALO
[2:33:00] <CappuccinoGuil> Arrows are VERY big ouchy[
[2:33:05] <BlackermanZX> have you ever had an arrow in your throat
[2:33:08] <%emperordread> Woolie seeing Minh's Dokage hat, then the "What if I implied stabbing you" comes back LUL
[2:33:10] <huskarl_zap> noi
[2:33:13] <%Livelinne> it's the fake hero episode?
[2:33:30] <dinnydanny777> I just got here, why is Woolie talking about "the depth of the penetration" ?
[2:33:32] <%doomerskeletor13> Woolie will figure out ammunition
[2:33:37] <huskarl_zap> A clean run through does less damage if it doesnt hit the heart or lungs
[2:33:52] <%Solidnick18> ambush

[2:34:17] <Admiral_PopnFresh> no, its not woolie, its the shockwave ripping and tearing soft flesh as it rips through the body
[2:34:25] <%doomerskeletor13> It’s actually worse sometimes if the bullet doesn’t go all the way through
[2:34:30] <wibbwobbler> THEY PLAYED US LIKE A DAMN FIDDLE

[2:37:15] <DesertPenguin> He said the name of the thing! He said the thing!
[2:37:24] <RaidenisDead> lmao
[2:37:28] <$BallerSwagBro9k> STACKS ON STACKS ON STCKS
[2:37:55] <%doomerskeletor13> Every mission with Ishikawa makes you realize more and more why Tomoe turned out the way she did.
[2:37:58] <%Solidnick18> i mean pure in his way
[2:38:03] <dinnydanny777> FROM MY POINT OF VIEW
[2:38:03] <BlackermanZX> he has honorable sins
[2:38:16] <huskarl_zap> Woolie "Whoops here i go killing again."
[2:38:25] <+jiggy_snipe> Tomoe was apparently always a scumbag based on the previous mission
[2:38:36] <wibbwobbler> justice was weird a couple hundred years back
[2:38:37] <%doomerskeletor13> Like Ishikawa I think you’re just a shitty teacher bro
[2:39:10] <$BallerSwagBro9k> WAT
[2:39:10] <dinnydanny777> @doomerskeletor13 Good archer though :)
[2:39:17] <huskarl_zap> look woolie the Ashigaru go in first to catch arrows
[2:39:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yeah, Tomoe was leading a group of bandits in her teens according to the last mission.
[2:39:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> Tomoe is NOT innocent.
[2:39:35] <+jiggy_snipe> Ishikawa ignored her past LUL cuz he wanted an heir
[2:39:41] <+jiggy_snipe> he's a huge moron
[2:39:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yup
[2:40:07] <BlackermanZX> DmC vergil flashbacks

[2:40:21] <+mikesapartment> Ahora podremos governar
[2:40:40] <dinnydanny777> @commandersqueaks Jin is a bandit to the Mongolians, though, it's all perspective
[2:41:00] <$BallerSwagBro9k> OH LETS GO
[2:41:00] <%Livelinne> Akio PrideUwu
[2:41:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> @dinnydanny777 I think Jin is a LOT MORE than a bandit at this point.
[2:41:10] <$BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYEYEYE
[2:41:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> Perhaps a humanoid typhoon is more apt.
[2:41:22] <%emperordread> He was my friend, I must spend a whole Shippuden stalking him
[2:42:34] <CappuccinoGuil> @CommanderSqueaks big difference is this: we have HEARD of her wrongdoings from strangers and the unreliable Ishikawa. We've SEEN Ishikawa being sus as fuck

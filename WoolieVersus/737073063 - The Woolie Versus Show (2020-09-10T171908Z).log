[0:57:57] <%CappuccinoGuil> Hey, y'all notice how the game kinda sidesteps how terrible Jin and Masako is as lords by saying "nah, they had it coming though"
[0:58:00] <$BallerSwagBro9k> SHES SUCH A BADASS
[0:58:05] <+solzan2000> am angry for her

[0:59:02] <$BallerSwagBro9k> YOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[0:59:03] <ralphfromdk> math is hard, huh?
[0:59:05] <mellorolo> she is softening up to you, truly is our granny..

[0:59:18] <+solzan2000> kinda powerful
[0:59:25] <+Weeewer> yes
[0:59:30] <%GeneralSCPatton> @weeewer Are you sure it's multiplicative and not additive?
[0:59:44] <+Weeewer> Uhh im pretty sure its multiplicative
[0:59:46] <EMP_Bob_Sagat_> oh boy
[0:59:49] <+Weeewer> 10 becomes 15
[0:59:52] <+GilroyGoldBlood> Hey chat! Just got here. Did I miss anything major?
[0:59:53] <MichaelDood> Whens the Mass Destruction charm Kappa
[0:59:56] <+Arkfyre> woolie no
[1:00:00] <therealtacopancakes> it's 50 of the percentage. 10 becomes 15 10+5
[1:00:01] <$BallerSwagBro9k> IT DOUBLES THE BASE PERCENTAGE
[1:00:05] <+Weeewer> Not 20 XD
[1:00:05] <%CappuccinoGuil> 20% still good, though
[1:00:05] <%doomerskeletor13> I hate math LUL I‚Äôm so bad at it

[1:00:13] <$BallerSwagBro9k> 10% BECOME 20
[1:00:14] <+Weeewer> 50% is not double!!
[1:00:15] <%DensityD> hate mate
[1:00:16] <%CappuccinoGuil> IT'S ALMOST AS IF %s ARE BULLSHIT
[1:00:19] <+Harro8> MATH

[1:00:29] <ralphfromdk> It's not explained well at all, but at least he got it now :D
[1:00:30] <outsidedoubtside> still real good ngl
[1:00:37] <%DensityD> not additive
[1:00:49] <$BallerSwagBro9k> QWIK MAFFS
[1:00:53] <%GeneralSCPatton> Games need to not be afraid of showing math.
[1:00:55] <%doomerskeletor13> It sounded broken, but it was our math that was broken
[1:01:12] <+Harro8> Theyre not really hiding anything
[1:01:16] <Daxalog> Showing numbers leads to player dissatisfaction and anxiousness.
[1:01:20] <+MessyBristles> just read though
[1:01:22] <+Weeewer> I understood what i meant immediately lol
[1:01:22] <%DensityD> they are not hiding, just use your brain, show your work, no calculators allowed
[1:01:24] <MiraLangsuir> WOOLIE WANT BIG NUMBER
[1:01:34] <TopLeftCenter> It's still stupid good, especially paired with some of the other stuff you get
[1:01:49] <outsidedoubtside> WE USING OUR FROG PERCENTAGES
[1:01:52] <%DensityD> way too good
[1:01:54] <+Weeewer> Its broken with the 40% chance to get your arrow back on Head shots

[1:02:23] <+solzan2000> I stacked yurikos charm, really effective
[1:02:42] <+Weeewer> 15% chance to refund is still good
[1:02:49] <%Rosewater_444> The R.E.G. system putting in work
[1:02:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i liked yuriko's with two fortune charms, with later armor it was poison/fear build
[1:03:08] <%Jack8274> Jack8274 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Pat fox, get swol
[1:03:10] <ralphfromdk> That charm might be the single best one in the whole game
[1:03:23] <+Weeewer> I also rock the Yuriko charms + Tayadori armor and just go crazy with slo-mo arrows
[1:03:37] <KyaputenFarukon> that momentum
[1:03:39] <+solzan2000> poison arrows so good
[1:03:54] <+solzan2000> and poison wind chimes
[1:04:06] <+Weeewer> I switch to poison wind chimes any stealth-forced mission
[1:04:09] <+Weeewer> they're so OP
[1:04:16] <+solzan2000> yea
[1:04:24] <%Rosewater_444> assuming...
[1:04:32] <%bread_assassin> Anyone know that if the Charm of Silence you get from the foxes gives a better resolve boost than the Charm of Resolve? One charm gives percentages and the other uses words.
[1:04:34] <ralphfromdk> solzan2000 But... what good will poison arrow do when i hit them in the face for 1 shot kills? :l

[1:05:01] <%Rosewater_444> animals
[1:05:14] <%Rosewater_444> they dig up bodies
[1:05:15] <ralphfromdk> Weeewer That's what the longbow is for. It goes through helmets
[1:05:26] <%unclekulikov> But like - why not 7 feet?
[1:05:28] <%CappuccinoGuil> it's like a 1.8m by 1.8m by 0.6m. That's a LOT of dirt
[1:05:30] <yunamtsang> Headbands are almost always on top of pagodas
[1:05:30] <outsidedoubtside> animals come to scavenge, or worse yet, rotting bodies expand and burst
[1:05:30] <%doomerskeletor13> Dude it took me two whole days just to dig out a two feet deep garden, six feet would take forever

[1:06:10] <mellorolo> also close the lid for your toilet flush
[1:06:10] <+froduck42> plus animals will smell the bodies and dig them up
[1:06:11] <Psyramics> shallow graves attract predators too

[1:31:35] <Admiral_PopnFresh> That's some fantasy shit right there
[1:31:45] <Halospaz117> I'm not actually sure, and I'm pretty sure the game does take liberties for plot
[1:31:46] <+AWanderingKenku> What's next Gosaku's armor though?
[1:31:56] <MiraLangsuir> Founds a school of philosophy on it.
[1:32:08] <Halospaz117> I say the Sakai set looks better in black
[1:32:08] <%doomerskeletor13> The game takes plenty of liberties with time period, it‚Äôs not historical really
[1:32:09] <+Estuko> Can you imagine having a duel with a samurai and he just gouges your insides with his fucking horns
[1:32:39] <%doomerskeletor13> Jins fursuit
[1:32:44] <Halospaz117> Honestly, I think my favorite part of the Sakai helmet is the brim across the eyes
[1:32:51] <EMP_Bob_Sagat_> it looks more normal with the mask
[1:32:59] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I LOVE deer antler helmets, Tadakatsu Honda, Yukimura Sanada octoPerfect

[1:34:51] <slegg0> the GHOST OF YARIKAWA
[1:34:58] <Halospaz117> I think the helmet works best with the Sakai set

[1:36:15] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I'm with Pat, I want a stupid looking character so it looks like I'm humiliating my enemy when I beat them
[1:36:37] <%BonewheelVanguard> Straw hat + full upgraded Kensei looks best
[1:36:46] <%doomerskeletor13> I agree Woolie
[1:36:57] <+Razputin217> Oops All Chosen Ones
[1:36:57] <+Estuko> LUL that's kinda why I like Runescape (osrs) we're all a bunch of dumb knights wizards archers running around

[1:37:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> "yo i heard you guys are cool but i guess not"
[1:37:13] <outsidedoubtside> i like to wear the riverbed straw hat, river prowler ronin set, and a white face cloth and rp my version of the ghost as a river spirit
[1:37:13] <Halospaz117> I changed my gear depending on the situation, I went Ronin most of the time just going place to place, but for big battles I put on armor
[1:37:51] <+jiggy_snipe> it's less bad when Jin is gonna be in front
[1:38:01] <therealtacopancakes> i like this scene

[2:49:37] <T_Sasquatch> Damn
[2:49:38] <$BallerSwagBro9k> WIND....INSIDE
[2:50:21] <ChungusQuest> cape rippling with lone swordsman energy

[2:50:38] <%DensityD> I schmell pennies
[2:50:48] <%Irridium> you should do that mythic tale it's dope
[2:51:19] <+Hasmeister96> @Prevot For me it's Captain Obi
[2:51:27] <+Hasmeister96> from Fire Force
[2:51:55] <T_Sasquatch> I almost never upgraded my bows
[2:51:58] <theCoolChild> Spend or Sell
[2:52:17] <T_Sasquatch> You're better off selling bamboo tbh
[2:52:17] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1303234770881699840?s=19
[2:52:19] <%jinking79> once both bows r max u just bamboo
[2:52:21] <%DensityD> 1 2 3
[2:52:31] <%DensityD> get another Ghost Stance
[2:52:37] <theCoolChild> that other man RAN
[2:52:42] <+duskrush> You ever have that moment where a dude gets terrified and starts running away?
[2:52:44] <+Jaysky> That bathrobe of yours scared them to death
[2:52:54] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Jin has killed so many of these guys you'd think at this point they'd run away LUL
[2:52:57] <+duskrush> like straight up hauling ass away from you?
[2:53:08] <T_Sasquatch> Yup
[2:53:22] <T_Sasquatch> There's an achievement for hitting a guy running away
[2:53:29] <%DensityD> all horses are meat
[2:53:33] <+Hasmeister96> @BallerSwagBro9k "But what if I could do it?" is what they're thinking
[2:53:36] <Prevot> some horses are more deluxe than others
[2:53:39] <%Irridium> you should wear the thief mask when you meet your uncle
[2:53:45] <%Irridium> to show how honorable you are
[2:53:50] <ELFucilaNeroIV> If they run away, any hit kills. So shooting them with an arrow or slashing them once works.
[2:53:59] <%DensityD> gaijinGrecklesSurprise
[2:53:59] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @BallerSwagBro9k So basically theyrr all Pat LUL
[2:54:02] <+Hasmeister96> @DensityD TO Italians and Germans during the Great Depression

[2:54:22] <theCoolChild> Not wearing the Sakai uniform in front of Uncle. Dishonor
[2:54:31] <$BallerSwagBro9k> One of the things I love about Wasteland 3 is once your reputation gets big some enemies will just flee from combat when they see you LUL
[2:54:59] <%DensityD> by the way uncle, I have the ghost Stance now
[2:55:06] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Show him that dishonor!

[2:56:38] <eldragon_1> Cool
[2:56:40] <%DensityD> nothing is wrong with Chinese silk itself, but the shogun decree was trying to enforce embargos or influence the market
[2:56:53] <%Rosewater_444> Mandalore himself said that a warrior without fear is a fool
[2:56:54] <%DensityD> Shogun wanted less to do with China and Chinese goods
[2:57:03] <$StaceMcGate> just two?
[2:57:07] <$StaceMcGate> to take a fort

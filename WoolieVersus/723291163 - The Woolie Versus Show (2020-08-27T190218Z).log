[0:48:40] <Louie_Salmon> A cookie dedicated store is not a thing here, at all
[0:48:49] <Animedingo> It won't let me cheer for some reason :(
[0:48:50] <Rawklobstah88> oh my god
[0:48:54] <%RadicalWeegee> woolie DLC ALT colors
[0:48:54] <%Proxzo> We have dedicated cookie stores in California
[0:48:56] <shiny_prinny> they look pretty good
[0:49:02] <+Reverend_Roscoe> The name has a fucking accent agout in it @WoolieVersus of course it's Quebec only
[0:49:04] <Rawklobstah88> they look so fuCKING good
[0:49:05] <garsedj> where is the paper mario?
[0:49:08] <%Proxzo> It's local stores that usually do cookie stuff
[0:49:10] <+krispen_wa> what cookie is this called?
[0:49:17] <%ringabal> That settles it. This year is the worst.
[0:49:17] <garsedj> i thought this was about video games
[0:49:23] <+Reverend_Roscoe> Felix and Norton
[0:49:27] <%chosenjuan42> PAPER MARIO & the thousand cookies
[0:49:28] <%RadicalWeegee> This is the paper mario ???
[0:49:31] <Rawklobstah88> They might be Montreal only
[0:49:35] <%alwaysneedcaffiene> yeah one guy
[0:49:43] <%RadicalWeegee> woolieONEGUY
[0:49:43] <Rawklobstah88> Their website only says "Montreal Delivery"
[0:49:43] <dreadedcthulhu> video games? this is a cookie review podcast show right???
[0:49:45] <Louie_Salmon> The name sounds dumb, that's how you know it's Canadian
[0:49:48] <@Menitta> yeah ok those cookies look good
[0:49:56] <garsedj> two canadians talking about chocolate is pretty far from paper mario
[0:50:00] <%Irridium> oh god these cookies look incredible what the fuck

[0:50:23] <%yusefHD> Shoutouts to St. Vitaeur bagels tho
[0:50:28] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @SirGO0SE There's Tim hortons in upstate NY. They're not great.
[0:50:32] <%CappuccinoGuil> Y'all don't have Sonho de Valsa, so it's a draw here LUL
[0:50:33] <bazz_tv> Quebec sounds like a great place to visit, aslong as you are hungry
[0:50:34] <@akuda_bar> I think so
[0:50:38] <%SirGO0SE> theres been a Tim Hortons in Penn Station (manhattan) for YEARS now but thats the only one ive seen
[0:50:57] <@Menitta> When I hear "Felix and Norton's" I'd assume a law firm
[0:50:59] <%Proxzo> @WoolieVersus We had an amazing cookie dedicated place. But I think they got shut down for money laundering.
[0:51:02] <garsedj> one more minute without paper mario and I send eyepatchwolf to force you to watch hunta hunta
[0:51:12] <bazz_tv> whenever you guys recommend places they are always food related
[0:51:18] <@akuda_bar> @Menitta we had a canadian student in one of my classes and we asked her where she drove first when she got her license and she said she drove two hours to a tim hortons
[0:51:19] <Rawklobstah88> Looks like they have supermarket distributors all across Toronto and Quebec.

[1:17:02] <+EdenOfLove> ice power also increases ur attack on ice enemies
[1:17:02] <plankk56> it sounds kinda cool tho mariaCheesy
[1:17:03] <Polarix64> Fire Drive is for offensive fire attack
[1:17:04] <%Solidnick18> fire drive
[1:17:04] <+EdenOfLove> Woolie
[1:17:09] <%Solidnick18> hmm
[1:17:09] <%chosenjuan42> Fire drive
[1:17:10] <+EdenOfLove> Fire enemies
[1:17:19] <+EdenOfLove> Ice power also increases attack on fire enemies by one
[1:17:21] <savetitania> Seriously this music is terraria as fuck
[1:17:21] <%GeneralSCPatton> "The work will invigorate your spirit and help you resist the disease" -some Outer Worlds asshole
[1:17:21] <Polarix64> Maybe unequip Jumpman just for this one area
[1:17:25] <%dekubaka> just viv to victory
[1:17:28] <savetitania> it's driving me nuts
[1:17:35] <%Solidnick18> maybe till your done with this area
[1:17:45] <+EdenOfLove> ice power does give you +1 attack on ice guys
[1:18:02] <%dekubaka> what? no
[1:18:04] <%chosenjuan42> Fire drive only worth it if you can one shot
[1:18:05] <atomicxdj> that works
[1:18:07] <Polarix64> @EdenOfLove Wait it does I didn't know that
[1:18:08] <savetitania> but it matches viv's cost
[1:18:13] <savetitania> does it overpower viv?
[1:18:26] <%SirGO0SE> Rem Lezar
[1:18:29] <%Koover> flower saver not worth it imo, its only 1FP
[1:18:36] <+regis_j_rock> @edenoflove You sure, I thought it was only +1 on fire
[1:18:40] <grimshuck> This area is not that big, you won't be encountering many ice enemies

[2:24:49] <%Chatterbox1991> BOMB CANCEL
[2:24:51] <+botchdogg> Don't bomb the messenger
[2:24:57] <%doomerskeletor13> Hey it’s not his fault! :(
[2:24:59] <RunoEddie> I'm guessing he's just taking a trip through all the chapter towns

[2:25:10] <+botchdogg> that's not how it works
[2:25:11] <+Jp3g95> ruuS
[2:25:12] <PKSomething> I doubt it'd work
[2:25:13] <%Exiliator> No wonder Nintendo didn't want the second one
[2:25:14] <Nomad94> Nope
[2:25:17] <+blaze__drag> NOPE
[2:25:19] <%chosenjuan42> you can't
[2:25:19] <Mr_Strut> sadly no
[2:25:20] <+botchdogg> You have to go throught the checkpoints
[2:25:21] <nyacoo> gotta activate the flags
[2:25:23] <ShiningAxis> TRIGGERS
[2:25:24] <%ringabal> No No No says Nintendo
[2:25:24] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> It wouldn't work, the dialogues are triggers.
[2:25:27] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> the flags

[2:25:33] <+blaze__drag> NOTENDO
[2:25:38] <SixthSun2> It's a set of dialog triggers, so no
[2:25:40] <jettsetter> this part feels intentionally obnoxious but I don't know why they did it
[2:25:45] <%GeneralSCPatton> The event flags are bullshit blazing

[2:26:07] <%Chatterbox1991> REGGIE
[2:26:09] <RunoEddie> guess they just want you to go through every town
[2:26:12] <+EdenOfLove> woolie the trouble stuff is 100% optional so the backtrack trek makes sense
[2:26:27] <Nomad94> We're suffering alongside you
[2:26:31] <shiny_prinny> it's weird because you can totally sequence break the Pianta shop password but not this
[2:26:31] <%Th3SmartAlec> @the_timo the game has had sequence breaking before, to be fair
[2:26:33] <RunoEddie> aren't there any troubles he could pick alongside?
[2:26:34] <missingangle> @chosenjuan42 if someone said this is the best, they lying their asses off. no matter how good the rest of it is LUL
[2:26:36] <Scorilla_> @EdenOfLove it absolutely does not
[2:26:41] <edward11231> It’s straight to the end after this iicr
[2:26:42] <dinnydanny777> Which ones are the Punies and which ones are the Jabies I forgot
[2:26:42] <nyacoo> Or not
[2:26:47] <extradopeness> At least Mario loves it
[2:26:51] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> ?
[2:26:53] <SixthSun2> ?
[2:26:55] <%ringabal> Woolie
[2:26:56] <%AFrostyCookie> ???
[2:26:57] <+gearcannon> ?
[2:26:58] <%Th3SmartAlec> ?
[2:26:59] <Nomad94> ?
[2:27:00] <+geosspone> ?
[2:27:00] <Polarix64> Talk to elder Woolie
[2:27:01] <nyacoo> Backtracking is never fun tbh
[2:27:03] <shiny_prinny> it's still awful design tho
[2:27:05] <cookieface127> ?
[2:27:05] <plankk56> this is just ffxiv's main storyline quests in a nutshell, go over say hi to this guy now go over there and say hi to that guy okay now do it again
[2:27:09] <%Chatterbox1991> Woolie Brain Not
[2:27:14] <time_axis> backtracking is fun in metroidvanias
[2:27:14] <+clapbeat> optional or not it sucks lol
[2:27:25] <Darthkitten_Prime> @nyacoo I think it can be fun if that's how the game works, like in metroid.
[2:27:25] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:27:26] <edward11231> I’m glad they cut that shit down in FF14
[2:27:31] <time_axis> if there was stuff to do in these places that you couldnt do before, it would be better
[2:27:32] <%Th3SmartAlec> Kappa
[2:27:33] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> LUL
[2:27:36] <atomicxdj> Kappa
[2:27:37] <Nomad94> The Dankness
[2:27:37] <Polarix64> Yep LUL
[2:27:37] <+Mahbonk> gee i wonder
[2:27:38] <@akuda_bar> LUL
[2:27:38] <CirclesForever> the heart of africa
[2:27:38] <%AFrostyCookie> LUL
[2:27:39] <dinnydanny777> So a cave?
[2:27:43] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> LUL
[2:27:45] <%ringabal> Woolie's Syncro Levels are rising
[2:27:49] <SteelSnake93101> LUL
[2:27:49] <+DeRedBaron> truth be told, i actually hate it when people say anything "x" is bad design cus legit that is bs nothing can be bad by nature, things good in one game arent' always good in other games
[2:27:55] <dinnydanny777> Twilight Town maybe?
[2:27:57] <+DeRedBaron> it means you just dont like it
[2:27:58] <+zero_jacks> its a biiig run around
[2:28:01] <%Th3SmartAlec> Yep
[2:28:03] <%Chatterbox1991> I love this chapter now! :)
[2:28:04] <%chosenjuan42> NO ONE LIKES CHASE OF GOOSE
[2:28:04] <missingangle> If they add more stuff to the backtracking aside from just the backtracking, stuff to make it WORTH it, then that's less aggravating.
[2:28:07] <prime_name> Not great
[2:28:07] <ChuckTheDumpTruck> HMMMM dark.... omegaLul
[2:28:09] <cosmicgoatee> LUL woolies frustration of heading 3 rooms over is rising
[2:28:10] <%Proxzo> yeah it stinks
[2:28:13] <%MonsterEnvy> No one likes the search for General White.
[2:28:14] <shiny_prinny> This main quest, and Frankie saying "I love you" 100 times are genuinely awful design choices
[2:28:15] <jettsetter> this is still annoying either way
[2:28:15] <dinnydanny777> GivePLZ White
[2:28:16] <Drusain> 2004
[2:28:30] <time_axis> I think it's literally just to get you to intentionally be annoyed
[2:28:31] <Polarix64> Also can you imagine not doing the trouble board and missing out on Ms. Mowz that makes no sense
[2:28:32] <%Rosen_Thorne> Oh this part is universally hated, yes.
[2:28:37] <ChuckTheDumpTruck> it’s like a scavenger hunt for general white
[2:28:41] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> jump
[2:28:44] <+DeRedBaron> really? that's weird i actually loved thsi part
[2:28:45] <%morgantj> It’s not great
[2:28:46] <+blaze__drag> tbh I think that the frankie saying I love you 100 times was a pretty good bit, and can be mashed through pretty quickly
[2:28:46] <ChuckTheDumpTruck> i kinda like it LOL
[2:28:48] <+thatguychris93> @time_axis yeah especially how it ends
[2:28:48] <+botchdogg> I think they knew how annoying it was considering how it ends
[2:28:49] <%Th3SmartAlec> @shiny_prinny at least you know how long Frankie talking will take
[2:28:53] <Polarix64> This point is dumb regardless
[2:28:55] <%ringabal> Oh someone donated
[2:28:59] <%Proxzo> You got bits
[2:29:00] <%Proxzo> hahaha
[2:29:08] <+regis_j_rock> The Frankie gag is fine, it takes like 2 minutes
[2:29:17] <%chosenjuan42> koops stronk
[2:29:18] <missingangle> At least with Frankie, you can spam the A button to continue and get done with it
[2:29:20] <+blaze__drag> whereas this thing takes like 20 minutes
[2:29:23] <edward11231> It’s pointless, there’s no reason to do this besides waste the players time
[2:29:25] <+regis_j_rock> This is obnoxious though, but hardly ruins tbe game
[2:29:29] <pistofficer> FOOTSIES!
[2:29:39] <+botchdogg> This felt a lot longer as a kid
[2:29:45] <cookieface127> nnout
[2:29:52] <%chosenjuan42> Single goomba boss
[2:30:18] <ChuckTheDumpTruck> it adds to the tension!
[2:30:29] <CirclesForever> hella powerful
[2:30:31] <shiny_prinny> yeah not a game ruiner but it's just bad
[2:30:37] <%ringabal> Imagine doing this as an all HP build
[2:30:41] <garsedj> will they do the 100floor pit before the end of the game?
[2:30:45] <jettsetter> was this supposed to be a joke at the player's expense?
[2:30:47] <Polarix64> @regis_j_rock True this section is dumb and stupid but the game is still fine, I would still argue the entire Punie chapter is worse than this
[2:30:48] <+botchdogg> hp
[2:30:49] <time_axis> all FP
[2:30:50] <%chosenjuan42> did he do ceiling pipe?
[2:30:53] <prime_name> All hp?
[2:30:53] <atomicxdj> all hp
[2:30:54] <@akuda_bar> all health
[2:30:55] <time_axis> no BP or HP
[2:30:56] <%chosenjuan42> bad badges
[2:30:58] <CirclesForever> all bp, but no badges
[2:30:59] <Papa_Bearman> @ringabal I HAVE done this all HP.
[2:30:59] <+blaze__drag> ALL HP would be boring as fuck
[2:30:59] <missingangle> Or when you play this as a kid, never found the pipes like a dumbass and actually went through all the worlds normally.
[2:31:00] <garsedj> i had 50 hp in my first playthrough!
[2:31:00] <shiny_prinny> @jettsetter seems like it
[2:31:07] <+NopeBadguy> worst build is probably pure hp
[2:31:07] <@akuda_bar> all hp, no moves
[2:31:16] <Drusain> Bad build = nothing but skills
[2:31:16] <Papa_Bearman> All HP is SO FUCKING BORING.
[2:31:21] <+blaze__drag> with FP you could at least use your powered up moves like ultra hammer and such all the time, and all BP is the best
[2:31:27] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> Mayor?
[2:31:28] <shiny_prinny> birds or the mayor?
[2:31:32] <Papa_Bearman> All FP is Super Hard Mode.
[2:31:32] <+blaze__drag> and splitevenly would just sorta be okay
[2:31:35] <+pectusumbra> mayor I'd assume
[2:31:37] <+pectusumbra> all HP
[2:31:37] <missingangle> Hey, ask Eva Kappa
[2:31:42] <%chosenjuan42> no FP worst
[2:31:45] <+blaze__drag> but all HP would just mean fights take forever and you barely have any choices to make
[2:31:51] <Papa_Bearman> All HP, I ran into no trouble whatsoever until the final boss.
[2:31:53] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> home?
[2:31:54] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> All FP is terrible
[2:31:54] <%Koover> inn maybe?
[2:31:57] <+pectusumbra> inn?
[2:31:59] <+Rhinoprotoss> He's dead
[2:32:02] <CirclesForever> were would you go if you were tired?
[2:32:02] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> HP at least gives you tankiness
[2:32:03] <prime_name> Poshly?
[2:32:04] <%ringabal> @WoolieVersus He went home
[2:32:05] <whiteblacklight74> bird gang
[2:32:06] <Polarix64> He went back to the Peadows
[2:32:10] <SixthSun2> I mean, there's only two regions left that he's not been at
[2:32:17] <+pectusumbra> I mean I'd check before leaving
[2:32:18] <cosmicgoatee> Peadows
[2:32:22] <@akuda_bar> none of these people are correct
[2:32:24] <%chosenjuan42> Did Woolie get the pipe?
[2:32:24] <Polarix64> He went back to his house
[2:32:32] <+james_cest_drole> He went home
[2:32:33] <Slim_Lipid> I'm correct :)

[2:34:32] <@akuda_bar> the pyrotechnics dont' do anything
[2:34:33] <+botchdogg> It sometimes deals damage
[2:34:36] <missingangle> Getting cheats from chat for this part is acceptable, because you wouldn't have known otherwise
[2:34:46] <dinnydanny777> Go see Norman in his gym, in the Petalburg
[2:34:53] <%chosenjuan42> General White quest was long and was not clear
[2:34:54] <+botchdogg> Doesn't it do damage? I remember it blowing stuff up
[2:35:16] <+regis_j_rock> Violence can run past him pretty easy
[2:35:18] <%TheRisingPride> can just run past on violence
[2:35:19] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie vs Depth is a 2-8 match-up

[2:36:31] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Nomad94 he's right, typo

[2:36:59] <Nomad94> @akuda_bar How dare you make me read that sentence
[2:37:02] <Papa_Bearman> Speedrunners never see Fahr Outpost at all.
[2:37:05] <ShiningAxis> santa is missing the "oh" in the beginning

[2:38:21] <Polarix64> Lady Bow is also the best Paper Mario partner by far just in general
[2:38:30] <RunoEddie> I think Karin from Street Fighter was the first I remember
[2:38:42] <dinnydanny777> VIOLENCE wasn't violent enough
[2:38:44] <+NopeBadguy> oh i forgot you had spike shield on lmao

[3:06:46] <%TheRisingPride> ignores defense and flips
[3:07:18] <Polarix64> Violence Gulp pierces defense if I remember correctly
[3:07:30] <%Euphbugg> oh yeah, forgot about mouse going through defense
[3:07:33] <grimshuck> quake hammer flips them over
[3:07:37] <shiny_prinny> there's plenty of options
[3:07:37] <%GeneralSCPatton> Spoiled for choice on how to punch through all that DEF

[3:09:15] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> normals
[3:09:39] <CrypticMochi> Quake hammer would do 8 right? That would probably save the most
[3:09:40] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[3:12:31] <%chosenjuan42> woolie you can detonate bobbery early
[3:12:47] <damienlunas> All my homies pump BP
[3:12:47] <GooseyGanderer> If Woolie doesn't reach that by the time he finishes playing I'm gonna be disappointed
[3:12:51] <Papa_Bearman> Yeah, when you throw Bobbery, press 'X' again to detonate him on the spot.
[3:12:51] <%chosenjuan42> P up D down

[3:13:19] <%TheRisingPride> you leveled
[3:13:19] <%Euphbugg> more FP?
[3:13:19] <+Jp3g95> I think you took off the defense one a while back
[3:13:24] <Polarix64> FP plus is good
[3:13:24] <Papa_Bearman> Use your Double Dip lifeline.

[3:13:47] <+pectusumbra> happy flower + charge?
[3:13:50] <CrypticMochi> He has a flower saver on right? So quake hammer would cost 2FP?
[3:14:00] <%yusefHD> gun
[3:14:08] <+regis_j_rock> P Up D Down is pretry great
[3:14:14] <%chosenjuan42> Lucky start is pretty cool
[3:14:26] <shiny_prinny> do you get negative defense in this game?
[3:14:29] <+pectusumbra> or just item hog?
[3:14:33] <%Koover> options are nice
[3:14:34] <GooseyGanderer> FP Plus perhaps?
[3:14:36] <hassanico2> No negative defense
[3:14:38] <%Rosen_Thorne> Pretty Lucky would be a good choice
[3:14:44] <%chosenjuan42> flower saver too
[3:14:44] <Polarix64> More FP is always good
[3:15:00] <GooseyGanderer> You keep struggling with FP loss
[3:15:06] <time_axis> if it were me I'd bring up HP to 30, but you dont have another HP up right now
[3:15:09] <%chosenjuan42> toe down timing add lucky start
[3:15:16] <+regis_j_rock> 1 Def > 5 Hp
[3:15:22] <%DensityD> He always wants a little bit more

[3:15:52] <alwayspronking> Pogchamp
[3:15:55] <%GeneralSCPatton> So, what fetishes are happening offscreen every time best girl Viv pulls Mario into the void? Hand holding?
[3:15:56] <%Koover> mans playing in 5F jump latency
[3:16:04] <%DensityD> STYLE IT
[3:16:19] <hassanico2> Does the whole game feel slower and not just the jumps?
[3:16:19] <GooseyGanderer> Not gonna lie, that was pretty stylish.
[3:16:26] <%chosenjuan42> you should use stars and let those refill as you do other fights
[3:16:32] <atomicxdj> not aligned

[0:06:14] <Afterman_> wait, wrong channel
[0:06:42] <QuantumButler> big doubt on a KoToR remake and even if they made one the people you'd want to make it haven't worked at that company since 2008

[0:07:19] <%HeavyMetalIceCream> @availablethor yo, ye should've assumed it was from the PinOut OST.
[0:07:20] <abelincoln_catpuncher> I mean they took a lot from the EU for the sequels, but implemented so much worse
[0:07:28] <Fujiwara_92> nar shadaa,first part was a whole lotta talking

[0:08:29] <arran_throttle> hi proto hellsing theme song
[0:08:36] <%Theycallmenerf> What’s up chat! I just punched out for lunch.
[0:08:45] <Ravenian96> General order most people go is Nar Shadaa - Dxun - Dantooine - Onderon - Korriban
[0:08:45] <arran_throttle> credits song'
[0:09:05] <Ravenian96> Cuz you get so many companions on Nar Shadaa
[0:09:09] <%StaceMcGate> Nar Shadaa is just so long though. Dantooine is the quickest
[0:09:21] <+arcielardor> I wonder if Woolie saw that trailer for Psycho Goreman.
[0:09:28] <Gruhunchously> Korriban is the quickest
[0:09:28] <%Theycallmenerf> Which song is playing rn? It slaps
[0:09:48] <%StaceMcGate> Korriban in the original version is quickest but hardest
[0:09:51] <arran_throttle> Dantooine and korrabin are bouth very short
[0:09:56] <Gruhunchously> But Korriban is not recommended as your first planet.

[0:10:33] <%derap41> Is that guy still on the naughty list of is he good now?
[0:10:39] <%DatAsuna> I do the other 3 in whatever order i feel like at the time

[0:23:34] <sylvastheicefairy> i definitely interpreted kreia's lesson as being about Small Mercies
[0:23:35] <muniea3> just reload a save
[0:23:36] <+glgzephyr> I wonder if we're leaving Nar Shadaa after getting the stuff
[0:23:37] <%DatAsuna> Losing means you shouldn't have tried
[0:23:43] <Joestar1890> if the quest kills them...screw em
[0:23:46] <lotharrio> Remember that girl you won in a card game? She'll never level up at this rate.
[0:23:47] <sylvastheicefairy> but i suppose it's not especially clear
[0:23:47] <siamzero94> Yes they deserved to die and i hope they burn in hell

[0:24:22] <+Fortunato5678> Sounds like the prequel to John Dies at the End
[0:24:42] <+PlagueOfGripes> Timba, his arms wide
[0:24:50] <%derap41> Star Trek tries at least
[0:24:51] <countgaculatv> John Lives in the Beginning
[0:24:52] <+ZoltanBMagnus> science fiction is indeed a thing
[0:24:56] <%DatAsuna> Ehhh
[0:25:00] <%DatAsuna> Not always
[0:25:01] <%GraceTBM> i like that
[0:25:04] <%komradedog> it just works!
[0:25:07] <+Shohinzo> Prequel to Jack and the End of The World
[0:25:07] <%VCRUZZO> yes
[0:25:12] <%DatAsuna> I think the problem is thinking you have a hard line on it either way
[0:25:14] <%TRILLTURBAN> Tbh the explaining of Star Wars always stops at The Force
[0:25:15] <%DatAsuna> it can ruin it
[0:25:20] <%DatAsuna> not doing it can also ruin it
[0:25:25] <%DatAsuna> It depends
[0:25:26] <%jiggy_snipe> you can explain some things
[0:25:29] <+PlagueOfGripes> the Force is a narrative device that ruins its own setting by turning off the agency of all of its characters
[0:25:31] <+glgzephyr> nah there's INSANE shit all over the EU
[0:25:35] <+glgzephyr> Gendy makes perfect sense
[0:25:49] <wsintai> @PlagueOfGripes The hottest takes
[0:25:55] <Chisas_Dead_Body> It doesn’t go Dragon Ball enough
[0:25:55] <ScreamLord> Japan has a lot of things that have a sentence for a title. Like: Is It Wrong to Pick Up Chicks in a Dungeon?
[0:25:56] <%GraceTBM> @PlagueOfGripes how does it remove the agency of ALL the characers?
[0:26:01] <%DatAsuna> Plague is in the right LP stream then
[0:26:05] <countgaculatv> Palpatine can create a black hole in the EU
[0:26:09] <lotharrio> You definitely want the Jedi to come across as powerful and important so that the Republic has reasons to put up with their shit.

[0:26:43] <%derap41> No do it perfectly the first tiem
[0:26:43] <%StaceMcGate> I mean, Cloud was yelling at you to use lightning
[0:26:45] <countgaculatv> Woolie, it literally told you to use Thunder.
[0:26:48] <%Grayhammatter> use force lightning though
[0:26:50] <siamzero94> ? Thunder was it's weakness in the original
[0:26:51] <zayasu> NotLikeThis

[0:27:04] <SheefEatsBeef> NotLikeThis woolie stole my pie
[0:27:07] <muniea3> but understanding mechanics ruins things!
[0:27:08] <countgaculatv> IT TOLD YOU THO LUL

[0:27:12] <ScreamLord> Not Like This
[0:27:13] <BlueMoonBlues> NotLikeThis
[0:27:14] <nikoloas_> the game literally told you tho
[0:27:14] <+Fortunato5678> I agree, but the characters were literally shouting it at you in the fight
[0:27:16] <%StaceMcGate> But the game made fun of you for not using it @WoolieVersus
[0:27:16] <lotharrio> @thackattack00 It's well established that Woolie doesn't read.
[0:27:18] <Fujiwara_92> not like this NotLikeThis
[0:27:23] <CastellanVon> Cloud is just yelling at you to use thunder tho lol
[0:27:24] <abelincoln_catpuncher> but the game literally told you multiple times to do it lol

[0:27:43] <+SarcFa> I mean in old canon the force actually guiding things was an in universe debate iirc, not sure about disney canon
[0:27:44] <DedlokPM> Or you make mistake and then you go on twitter and complain about how complicated they made it and how they throw so many systems at you at once. rooSmug

[0:27:45] <readytoeat> LUL
[0:27:47] <%SeruraRenge> @PlagueOfGripes Yeah but it's shitty logic. Your actions are your responsibility as it is the responsibility of the mother who birthed him, the mother who birthed her who then birthed him, the person who taught him how to read, the person who gave him the clothes that he was wearing when he met you, etc. aka trying to dig that hard into the chains of causality is completely pedantic and worthless.
[0:27:51] <%VCRUZZO> I want to see you and others make mistakes and learn the game(s) like we who played it did
[0:27:54] <xthomaswellertonx> when I saw the doom ep 1 I was kinda mad that woolie was SO blind

[0:27:58] <BlueMoonBlues> VoHiYo
[0:27:58] <%derap41> Wow Woolie mad disrespect
[0:28:03] <%krispen_wa> Is the Force just Nietszche's Will to Power except with force lightning
[0:28:13] <%SirTopHat_III> A METER! FILTHY METRICS!
[0:28:22] <%DatAsuna> Less than paige does
[0:28:22] <%GraceTBM> it's just bad placement

[0:28:26] <siamzero94> YES HE DOES
[0:28:31] <%jiggy_snipe> I'm glad Woolie didn't use thunder, it showed more voice lines

[0:28:49] <%Theycallmenerf> @muniea3 he gets it
[0:29:12] <zayasu> monkaS
[0:29:12] <countgaculatv> @SeruraRenge Almost as bad logic as the force inducing a child of prophecy who's actual job was to phyiscally balance the usuage of the force by genociding children.
[0:29:13] <nikoloas_> I will
[0:29:14] <+glgzephyr> the persecution complex is real
[0:29:14] <ScreamLord> Girls are watching
[0:29:15] <%DatAsuna> You will yell at you
[0:29:15] <%RioGascar> have you considered getting a different monitor for streaming exclusively?
[0:29:16] <%VCRUZZO> lol girls are watching!
[0:29:17] <lotharrio> The most mad.
[0:29:18] <%derap41> People will yell at you anyway

[0:29:30] <+glgzephyr> then you recover
[0:29:36] <Chatterbox1991> MrDestructoid500 As someone who is a Fiend for Dragon Age, the best way i could sell Origins to is this: Dragon Age: Origins is to Tolkin that Stranger Things season 1 is to Stephen King IE yes it's elves, dwarves and dragons, ect. It's just the best, most well written and interesting version of elves, dwarves and dragons out there, plus a few story telling curve balls, particularly in the first and third game, it's equal to the Witcher in my eyes, if not slightly higher. Love you guys.
[0:29:40] <xthomaswellertonx> own it
[0:29:46] <%SeruraRenge> @countgaculatv Except that was never Anakin's job, it was to destroy the sith and he didn't fulfill it until he chucked the emperor in the hole
[0:29:47] <+SarcFa> You'll fuck up, just make sure you don't fuck up hugely
[0:29:53] <xthomaswellertonx> fail but FAIL SPECTACULARLY
[0:29:57] <%DatAsuna> Your dad sounds funny
[0:29:57] <ashvsworld> Its like falling over and turning it into an epic dance move.
[0:30:08] <%krispen_wa> DA:O is just LOTR except with racism against Elves instead of from Elves
[0:30:10] <%GraceTBM> multi-brain-path-drifting
[0:30:18] <%derap41> People care about mistakes they care about people missing their mistakes
[0:30:20] <countgaculatv> @SeruraRenge His job was to balance the force. Why does everyone interpret that he'd just kill Sith?

[0:30:33] <+PlagueOfGripes> Fire up the Scorpion's backside also does a ton of damage, for some reason
[0:30:36] <%DatAsuna> @GraceTBM
[0:30:38] <%VCRUZZO> Revan fucks?
[0:30:38] <GarbageQueenEllie> Bastila's the snackiest
[0:30:56] <%DatAsuna> Yes revan fucks
[0:30:58] <lotharrio> The most important thing about DA:O is to hate and discriminate against elves. Fuck knife-ears.
[0:30:58] <sw0rdmstr> And in DA:O, Dwarves are russian communists instead of midget vikings.
[0:30:59] <stayinthepocket> Pretzels lie!
[0:30:59] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1234692167358177282?s=19
[0:31:04] <%krispen_wa> Bane? Why does he wear the mask?
[0:31:14] <%VCRUZZO> yeah
[0:31:16] <Gruhunchously> Revan fucks, the Exile absolutely does not.
[0:31:17] <MidnightBurst12> Revan undeniably fucks
[0:31:18] <%SeruraRenge> @countgaculatv Because retards don't understand what balancing the force means, there is no "light side". There's THE FORCE and a corruption of it that isn't supposed to exist called the Dark Side
[0:31:18] <%DatAsuna> Bane is gonna blow up goatham city
[0:31:32] <%krispen_wa> The Exile can "fuck" Visas
[0:31:43] <+wintrysoma> @SeruraRenge which is really dumb
[0:31:49] <%VCRUZZO> Exile does not cause she looked at her options and went "Naw"
[0:31:56] <%GraceTBM> it's sick the medal is secret and electrified @WoolieVersus
[0:31:56] <trickquestionz> There's Legends, there's SWTOR, and then theres the new stuff, basically. They're essentially incompatible
[0:32:00] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @krispen_wa Mind Fuck anyways
[0:32:01] <CastellanVon> So few people actually do a playthrough of it, but you can be absolutely cartoonishly evil with DAO and Mass Effect
[0:32:01] <GarbageQueenEllie> Exile should be allowed to fuck
[0:32:05] <%SeruraRenge> @wintrysoma 'Doesn't matter, that's what Lucas said
[0:32:15] <%GraceTBM> arcade mode is so fast it's great
[0:32:17] <%MeatBomb> SKKRRRRT
[0:32:21] <%VCRUZZO> Male Exile though is sweating at his options
[0:32:26] <%GraceTBM> siege
[0:32:27] <ScreamLord> Chaingun?
[0:32:31] <ashvsworld> Only real romance option that should be available is with HK47
[0:32:33] <%SeruraRenge> @wintrysoma Lucas is a methodist, the idea of good and evil being equal is incompatible with his religious beliefs
[0:32:33] <%DatAsuna> yeee siegemode portable
[0:32:36] <sw0rdmstr> Actually DA:O doesn't have a morality system
[0:32:40] <%GraceTBM> if you charge siege while jumping you keep better moblility
[0:32:41] <%JJCheeker> Jolee knew what sex was
[0:32:42] <lotharrio> The Exile fucks. HARD. His waifu-harem barely contain themselves and Atton is wildly emasculated by it.
[0:32:43] <%DatAsuna> I also love the railgun pushing you thru the air
[0:32:49] <%krispen_wa> @ashvsworld Based on his definition of love, you'd be dead at the end of it
[0:32:51] <+glgzephyr> gotta kill three demons with one blast five times
[0:32:55] <theKingRamses> sounds like gauntlet
[0:33:10] <trickquestionz> But the thing is, people were running with the idea of "The Jedi were wrong, balance means equal Jedi and Sith" in the original EU, very soon after RotS happened, because that is a perfectly valid way to read that movie.
[0:33:19] <%derap41> But Gay Elves though
[0:33:21] <%DatAsuna> Shame I don't like stranger things
[0:33:25] <%SeruraRenge> @trickquestionz It's also factually wrong
[0:33:26] <GarbageNirvana> I dunno if it's the BEST
[0:33:28] <%StaceMcGate> Its not amazing writing, but its fun
[0:33:36] <GarbageNirvana> It's good, sure
[0:33:37] <AbSoluteMadLadSS> finalPOG finalPOG finalPOG
[0:33:38] <siamzero94> Equal to witcher?
[0:33:40] <+PlagueOfGripes> Origins has very similar writing to this game, in the sense of dialogue battles
[0:33:43] <ScreamLord> @WoolieVersus There is a Rune that gives you infinite ammo for everything but the Chainsaw and BFG as long ass you have 100 Armor or more
[0:33:45] <%StaceMcGate> Elves are still tree huggers and dwarves still blacksmith
[0:33:48] <+wintrysoma> @SeruraRenge in a better system each side would have their flaws, like the "light side" abused leads to puritanical order-above-all-else totalitarianism while the abuse of the dark side leads to social darwinism
[0:33:52] <Gruhunchously> Now lets not get ahead of ourselves here.
[0:33:52] <ashvsworld> @krispen_wa Atleast the smug exchange would be worth it MaxLOL
[0:33:55] <%JJCheeker> Jolee > Kreia
[0:33:56] <dorpork> DA:O is not that good
[0:33:59] <%StaceMcGate> Qunari are the most interesting race, being Borg Muslims
[0:34:08] <Halospaz117> Yeah witcher edges out for me, but I like both
[0:34:12] <StarlitStunner> Qunari and the Qun are still hot
[0:34:15] <+PlagueOfGripes> It's pretty good. Not perfect
[0:34:16] <+glgzephyr> people like stuff that is good
[0:34:17] <%SeruraRenge> @wintrysoma That's not the world Lucas created though

[0:34:23] <%Ashenik1> Woolie has to play the witcher game!

[0:34:23] <%MeatBomb> Elves ARE garbage GNOMES!
[0:34:28] <%krispen_wa> DA2 has Sarcastic Hawke, and he's the best Bioware Protagonist ever
[0:34:28] <ScreamLord> Dragon Age Elves have it easy compared to Witcher Elves
[0:34:29] <%DatAsuna> Fuck da dread wolf
[0:34:31] <Chatterbox1991> id say Witcher does Elves Better, Dragon Age does Dwarves Better
[0:34:33] <%VCRUZZO> me niether
[0:34:35] <trickquestionz> Lucas changed his own mind several times on this kind of stuff
[0:34:35] <muniea3> people keep recommending SAO though
[0:34:38] <Fujiwara_92> fuck everquest
[0:34:39] <Prevot> LUL
[0:34:39] <lotharrio> Qunari, giant bull-men communist Confucians.
[0:34:40] <theKingRamses> can you even play everquest
[0:34:41] <%DatAsuna> I played everquest
[0:34:42] <%DatAsuna> and eh
[0:34:44] <+glgzephyr> no one has ever played Everquest
[0:34:50] <%krispen_wa> DA:I in general was boring, but the LORE was really good
[0:34:51] <Halospaz117> Everquest is a myth
[0:34:53] <%DatAsuna> oh no I'm nobody
[0:34:53] <GarbageQueenEllie> "Balance in the Force" just means the bad guy go die and plot is resolved.
[0:34:59] <%StaceMcGate> I don't even remember what happened in Inquisition anymore, really didn't care for the Mage/Templar conflict
[0:35:01] <Gruhunchously> Everquest dpes
[0:35:04] <QuantumButler> I played Everquest OG, and even back in the day I wouldn't have reccomended it
[0:35:04] <TuxedoNash> @Halospaz117 you took the words outta my mouth
[0:35:06] <%SeruraRenge> Star Wars from the movies is NOT a morally gray setting. You're either very very good or very very bad, and anyone like Lando that tries to stay in the middle is forced to take a side
[0:35:06] <+PlagueOfGripes> Enchantment!
[0:35:12] <+SarcFa> GarbageQueenEllie has the real answer
[0:35:15] <$QueequegTheater> Man I'm super happy my laptop keeps crashing as I try to download DS2 to stream snipe Paige
[0:35:18] <Halospaz117> Everquest was just the Mandela Effect
[0:35:19] <ingman112> Yo v that thing in the refugee sector—you probably already know but get that ASAP. Useful for getting around (and avoiding getting gated out of shit)
[0:35:20] <Gruhunchously> Everquest doesn't exist, and the people who think it does don't exist either.
[0:35:20] <countgaculatv> @SeruraRenge That's like saying the concept of doing good doesn't exist. If you ever watched clone wars, they have literal maniphestations of the light and dark by God children and Anakin's involvement inevitably kills them both.
[0:35:28] <siamzero94> We're going to be here a looooooooong time
[0:35:30] <%JJCheeker> Tis time
[0:35:37] <Chatterbox1991> Dragon Age is special to me because it's the first setting ive seen actually do Dwarves different and not just be generic blacksmiths
[0:35:38] <Gruhunchously> 'Third World' is a good way to describe Nar Shadaa
[0:35:40] <%VCRUZZO> @SeruraRenge Unless your Kyl-I mean Ben Solo
[0:35:43] <trickquestionz> Why did it even take so long for a Chosen One to appear anyways? If balanced=No Dark side the Sith have been tearing things up unopposed for thousands of years
[0:35:43] <+glgzephyr> time for two stream Nar Shadaa!
[0:35:45] <CptVolkow> !uptime
[0:35:45] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 35 minutes and 47 seconds
[0:35:46] <Fujiwara_92> nar shaddaa time
[0:35:56] <%DatAsuna> A jar of sync tests
[0:36:00] <+glgzephyr> one stream for the Refugee Sector?
[0:36:03] <lotharrio> @SeruraRenge I dunno. Jabba the Hutt was just a crime boss who wanted his damn money, and the Rebellion ganked him to get Han out of debt, more or less.
[0:36:05] <Katorskay> Ctrl + A delete
[0:36:06] <theKingRamses> @Chatterbox1991 you should check out warhammer fantasy sometime if you haven't already
[0:36:11] <MidnightBurst12> complete fabrication
[0:36:17] <+wintrysoma> @trickquestionz bad writing
[0:36:22] <%MeatBomb> Dwarves are RAD in ANY medium.
[0:36:23] <$QueequegTheater> Woolie there are 8 buttons their
[0:36:25] <+Bluemanzee> I wanna see someone do Dwarves that are like Norse mythology in that they are about the same height as humans
[0:36:26] <$QueequegTheater> *there
[0:36:27] <%TRILLTURBAN> OOOOO I remember that one
[0:36:33] <%JJCheeker> i keep forgetting that this footage is edited later for YouTube
[0:36:39] <ScreamLord> @WoolieVersus Balance in the Force is SO less interesting in current canon than it was in Legends. In Canon "balance" is literally "The Lightside always wins"
[0:36:41] <+wintrysoma> @Bluemanzee I mean, there's TES where dwarf is a misnomer
[0:36:44] <RetributionP> !uptime
[0:36:44] <GarbageQueenEllie> This planet gave me a lot of stress because the open world element is cut off at a certain part, making you unable to continue certain missions
[0:36:44] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 36 minutes and 46 seconds
[0:36:46] <%VCRUZZO> YEAH
[0:36:49] <AbSoluteMadLadSS> brouldHC brouldHC brouldHC
[0:36:55] <+glgzephyr> that's so dumb
[0:36:55] <$QueequegTheater> It's big brain time
[0:36:56] <%SeruraRenge> @lotharrio He was a bad person and the good guys kiled him. Easy to understand
[0:36:59] <%Ashenik1> @PlagueOfGripes What do you mean when you say force controls everybody in Kotor 2 ?? Like even the most poewrful sith ?
[0:36:59] <trickquestionz> VADER COMIC IS SO GOOD
[0:37:02] <Halospaz117> That's stupid, I love it
[0:37:03] <%krispen_wa> Everyone complains about Jedi being really stratified and dogmatic and shit, but no one ever remembers how Luke's Jedi Order was basically what everyone wants a "Gray Jedi" to be, just a bunch of dudes who use the force for good and aren't too tied down to following a code to a T
[0:37:09] <+Bluemanzee> @wintrysoma Yeah but they're elves, but I admit I think that's also a really cool interpretation
[0:37:11] <%DatAsuna> I like when the vader comic turns him into black manta
[0:37:12] <KaseKaizer> monkaS
[0:37:14] <Halospaz117> FORCE GHOST
[0:37:15] <nikoloas_> HE WAS A GHOST
[0:37:16] <theKingRamses> ????
[0:37:17] <$QueequegTheater> Dont worry
[0:37:19] <%krispen_wa> N-NANI
[0:37:19] <Gruhunchously> Whoosh
[0:37:19] <trickquestionz> To be fair, that guy also mind tricked them
[0:37:21] <%Irridium> don't worry about it
[0:37:28] <lotharrio> He used a stealth belt.

[0:37:37] <%alpacasintophats> there we go it's done
[0:37:40] <+rider_megalon> hey Ray could do it
[0:37:40] <StarlitStunner> Space Ghost going coast to coast
[0:37:43] <%GeneralSCPatton> So, if a bunch of clone troopers go to a diner, everyone could get fucked because someone mentions their Order Number?
[0:37:46] <%SeruraRenge> @ScreamLord this is a much easier concept to understand if you're christian like Lucas because it's established that God will always win
[0:37:48] <%DatAsuna> And this guy is a weequay
[0:37:49] <Gruhunchously> Oh man, we're coming up to that scene.
[0:37:53] <%DatAsuna> Weequay are born to job
[0:37:56] <%TRILLTURBAN> #HumanLivesMatter
[0:37:57] <%Theycallmenerf> Shit did I miss a part before? They were on the green planet to get the Ebon Hawk.
[0:38:00] <+PlagueOfGripes> enforce the law with battle axes
[0:38:01] <$QueequegTheater> @GeneralSCPatton Only if there are Jedi there
[0:38:01] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:38:08] <+Bluemanzee> He's got radio speakers for a voice box
[0:38:08] <%krispen_wa> @GeneralSCPatton Only if Sheev makes that order in a diner
[0:38:12] <ScreamLord> @SeruraRenge It's boring tho
[0:38:14] <trickquestionz> Everyone in this galaxy hates humans
[0:38:15] <Matermind0> Oh boy time for this
[0:38:18] <%StaceMcGate> Oh man, "that" option is coming
[0:38:19] <%MeatBomb> Execute Order DoritosChip Dank Lord.
[0:38:19] <lotharrio> @Theycallmenerf Sounds like you missed a few parts.
[0:38:21] <+PlagueOfGripes> oh no, Kreia isn't here to lecture!
[0:38:23] <whirly25> their talking sounds like the grapefruit method
[0:38:24] <%JJCheeker> Oh boy here we go
[0:38:27] <siamzero94> Prepare for Kreia
[0:38:28] <ashvsworld> Turn around, Go back to the ship and wait for this all to simply blow over..
[0:38:30] <Halospaz117> "Yo can I buy some tickets to this show?"
[0:38:30] <Gruhunchously> You should bring Handmaiden with you
[0:38:36] <sw0rdmstr> Ah man, I remember this level so well...
[0:38:40] <%GeneralSCPatton> @serurarenge God's a bitch who hasn't gotten off the couch in millenia
[0:38:42] <%SeruraRenge> @ScreamLord It's not boring to believe in life that it'll all work out and God has a plan for you. It's comforting if anything.
[0:38:44] <%VCRUZZO> @Ashenik1 "the force has a will of its own", therefore any action you take can be seen as doing its will whether willingly or not
[0:38:47] <JetpackMcQuack> Worldstar!
[0:38:56] <%VCRUZZO> its disgusting
[0:38:59] <+glgzephyr> @Gruhunchously nah, Handmaiden is really easy to get Influence with
[0:39:01] <trickquestionz> He sure can't get his message across very clearly then
[0:39:07] <%JJCheeker> I remember a part right here Being glitch
[0:39:21] <%JJCheeker> I think I'm broke my game
[0:39:27] <Gruhunchously> @glgzephyr I know, but she has some cool lines in this area.
[0:39:29] <$QueequegTheater> more where that came from
[0:39:32] <Chatterbox1991> pl-plop
[0:39:34] <sw0rdmstr> I accidentally made someone fall off then did it again, in another playthrough. On Nar Shadda
[0:39:36] <%BallerSwagBro9k> GASP gameplay
[0:39:37] <%Ashenik1> @VCRUZZO where is it established though?
[0:39:44] <$QueequegTheater> Toydarian
[0:39:44] <%TRILLTURBAN> King Kahtunka?
[0:39:45] <NotTheCoronaVirus> i wonder when people will stop trying to apply KOTOR2's take of the force into canon. It's just based on what the main writer thought.
[0:39:48] <+PlagueOfGripes> not even a corpse. just "what is left"
[0:39:53] <lotharrio> No wonder he was shaking down a refugee. Has a single credit on him.
[0:39:58] <Redblood801> King Kahtunka was such a swell dude
[0:40:07] <%GeneralSCPatton> @notthecoronavirus But it's cool tho
[0:40:11] <+MARTIANxMADNESS> Here it comes. The moment that shows how terribly stupid Kreia is. She does telepathically speak to you, right?
[0:40:15] <trickquestionz> Yeah this interpretation of the force was shut down and buried by the old EU well before all of it was erased.
[0:40:22] <%JJCheeker> She said to use people
[0:40:22] <%Irridium> so nothing their corpse fades away
[0:40:24] <+wintrysoma> @NotTheCoronaVirus it also kind of fails because it'slimited by the game mechanics
[0:40:28] <%BioHunter> when kotor2 stops being better written
[0:40:30] <%JJCheeker> She gonna get mad
[0:40:31] <$QueequegTheater> the exchange
[0:40:36] <$QueequegTheater> it's the exchange
[0:40:47] <%SeruraRenge> it's ALWAYS the exchange
[0:40:53] <siamzero94> No
[0:40:53] <QuantumButler> hello there mister Developer VA
[0:40:54] <Prevot> this is not an old man's voice
[0:40:55] <$QueequegTheater> No, its the exchange
[0:40:55] <%DatAsuna> During kotor it is
[0:40:55] <+glgzephyr> this is where the Exchange LIVES
[0:41:00] <%SeruraRenge> if Sith are not involved, it's the Exchange
[0:41:00] <%DatAsuna> but they go away by the movies
[0:41:00] <GarbageQueenEllie> Oh man, I think Woolie's going to really like the party member on this world
[0:41:02] <trickquestionz> Sometimes its the Hutts
[0:41:09] <%JJCheeker> I mean they are the biggest crime syndicate
[0:41:14] <$QueequegTheater> T H E E X C H A N G E
[0:41:15] <countgaculatv> Every once in awhile, it's the Sith
[0:41:19] <lotharrio> Exchange, Czerka, uhh... Hutts. I think there's some other crime timers.
[0:41:20] <+skylerpilot> what is this VO
[0:41:26] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Viskwang
[0:41:26] <ashvsworld> Are we planning on getting the Dancer Outfit for this run?
[0:41:26] <%GeneralSCPatton> Big crime world
[0:41:32] <lotharrio> GasKWANG
[0:41:38] <%DatAsuna> You'll see it and forget it
[0:41:50] <NotEvenSteve> So cool little V mills lets woolie play on his channel
[0:41:50] <%MeatBomb> Volus are pretty good dwarves. Also, Elcor. Also Krogen. M<an, what happened to that series?
[0:41:57] <+PlagueOfGripes> sshhh, no, it's ok
[0:42:03] <%VCRUZZO> @Ashenik1 mostly people say this throughout star wars. Qui-gon, Kreia, etc.
[0:42:06] <countgaculatv> sshhh
[0:42:16] <Redblood801> It's time for the scene
[0:42:19] <%RedDragonMoth> oh this one
[0:42:22] <+wintrysoma> oh god
[0:42:23] <siamzero94> NO filthy beggar
[0:42:33] <+glgzephyr> Sell T3!
[0:42:44] <%JJCheeker> Oh that's right it's this one
[0:42:46] <$QueequegTheater> Zez-kwang
[0:43:08] <%startstoprepeat> zez-kai e the second
[0:43:09] <%VCRUZZO> @Ashenik1 could even use the Plagueis book as a point where it denied him what he wanted
[0:43:17] <+glgzephyr> there's no audio
[0:43:18] <countgaculatv> I bet you probably would of said Zez-Kai Eli
[0:43:38] <GarbageQueenEllie> So sad I missed the "savagely dunk on Atris" scene
[0:43:44] <sw0rdmstr> If we're talking about best dwarves- ENCHANTMENT!
[0:43:53] <%DatAsuna> this whole planet is a lot of people with unfitting voices
[0:43:53] <siamzero94> Oh jeez why would you say that on a crime planet?
[0:43:53] <+PlagueOfGripes> bet it must hurt the eyes to hold a conversation with people wearing these masks
[0:43:54] <countgaculatv> ENCHANTMENT!
[0:43:59] <Chatterbox1991> ENCHANTMENT
[0:43:59] <+wintrysoma> sounds like a dao va
[0:43:59] <Gruhunchously> @GarbageQueenEllie It was pretty glorious.
[0:44:09] <Chatterbox1991> ID LIKE SOME SALAMANDERS PLZ
[0:44:22] <countgaculatv> High price huh?\
[0:44:23] <%VCRUZZO> but then made Anikan happen anyway cause LUL LUL
[0:44:30] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Gruhunchously Might be my absolute favorite part of the game. She's just so much fun to hate!
[0:44:36] <$QueequegTheater> I blame Atris
[0:44:40] <%VCRUZZO> lol
[0:44:44] <%GeneralSCPatton> Best dwarves are from Dwarf Fortress. They're the only ones that make infinitely recursive masterpieces.

[0:48:09] <%DatAsuna> stab him with your invisible knife
[0:48:09] <MidnightBurst12> ECHOES
[0:48:10] <AbSoluteMadLadSS> finalMEH finalMEH finalMEH
[0:48:10] <%ironohki> Neato
[0:48:11] <%bread_assassin> Good going, Woolie.
[0:48:12] <Reizie_Etherealm> Should've swung back
[0:48:12] <Katorskay> Then why do anything ever
[0:48:13] <siamzero94> Look at that jank you caused Woolie!
[0:48:13] <+glgzephyr> I can SMELL those five credits on you
[0:48:14] <%TRILLTURBAN> But now that guy has 5 credits, so two people were happy!
[0:48:15] <Fujiwara_92> IT'S YOUR FAULT WOOLS LUL
[0:48:18] <lotharrio> Well, you still gave money to a refugee. Just had a middle man.
[0:48:19] <trackles_64> I heard they are doing a remake of this.
[0:48:20] <Prevot> shut up grandma
[0:48:20] <GarbageQueenEllie> That Jade Empire reference
[0:48:23] <Bruno_Tropical> YOU FUCKED UP
[0:48:23] <%StaceMcGate> KOTOR: The Line
[0:48:24] <%JJCheeker> Look he didn't do anything bad he got killed
[0:48:27] <%SouLucha> You can't win in this no matter what you do.
[0:48:27] <+NiSoKr> Kreia's philosophy is a little too real world for me. Too close to what people actually say
[0:48:28] <+308caliber> look at what you did Woolie! LUL
[0:48:28] <ThalosTheSoviet> I KILLED THIS MAN FOR $5
[0:48:29] <%krispen_wa> You shouldn't help people, or hurt people, but APATHY IS DEATH
[0:48:30] <+Fortunato5678> Charity is bad says the PRAGMATIC one
[0:48:31] <+PlagueOfGripes> It's actually more damning to Kreia's philosophy if you play perfectly in line with what she would want you to do, rather than just disagreeing with her. Also this scene fucks you no matter whattttt
[0:48:33] <%JJCheeker> It doesn't make any sense honestly
[0:48:34] <%jiggy_snipe> if you help people, you'll get them killed Woolie!!!
[0:48:34] <%GeneralSCPatton> WHY DID YOU MUG THAT POOR GUY, WOOLIE!?
[0:48:38] <+glgzephyr> that's perfect
[0:48:39] <%HeavyMetalIceCream> thats some fuckin, dumb atlas shrugged shit
[0:48:39] <%derap41> But Fuck the Poor Woolie
[0:48:43] <$QueequegTheater> She's ALWAYS LIKE THAT
[0:48:47] <rubbishbinge> He will now invent white phosphorus
[0:48:49] <Fujiwara_92> THERE'S WISDOM IN THAT
[0:48:49] <+MrRabbles> Kreia WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY
[0:48:49] <ThatGuyThere03> See, this type of shit is why you went against the Jedi Council
[0:48:55] <Bruno_Tropical> YEAH SHOW HER WOOLIE
[0:48:58] <%gatorafan> Woolie you MURDERED that guy by giving him FIVE credits LUL
[0:48:58] <+MARTIANxMADNESS> Thanks for the lesson Chris Avel- err I mean, Kreia
[0:49:00] <muniea3> she does do it if you're evil though
[0:49:02] <+eanscrale> wait what, she's right???
[0:49:03] <CastellanVon> Kreia: Fuck the poor
[0:49:03] <GarbageNirvana> If ifs, ands, or buts were candy and nuts, we'd all have a merry Life Day
[0:49:05] <skeith77> woolie killed another guy indirectly LUL
[0:49:06] <ScreamLord> @WoolieVersus She says about the same thing if your a douchbag
[0:49:07] <Reizie_Etherealm> That dude just neutral'ed it, he didn't block or I-framed or dodge or parry or nothin'
[0:49:09] <%JJCheeker> She just doesn't like poor people
[0:49:11] <%SouLucha> Damned if you do, damned if you don't.
[0:49:14] <$QueequegTheater> She probably paid that guy to mug him
[0:49:14] <%VCRUZZO> @PlagueOfGripes yeah this scene she wants to show you up
[0:49:14] <Prevot> "don't you hate being nice, don't you just wanna go apeshit"
[0:49:21] <Tucker0603> fuck kreia
[0:49:22] <Gruhunchously> Echoes
[0:49:31] <lotharrio> Kreia is busy sniffing her own farts.
[0:49:33] <+glgzephyr> Kreia is just antagonistic by nature
[0:49:36] <%MeatBomb> axialOwl The force is strong with this one.
[0:49:36] <%gatorafan> OOPS! ALL WRONG!
[0:49:37] <GarbageNirvana> So either way she's a bitch
[0:49:37] <%krispen_wa> This scene fucking SUCKS
[0:49:39] <%DatAsuna> They shoulda just shown him buying spice. lol
[0:49:41] <%Ashenik1> @PlagueOfGripes so maybe the point of this scene is that your action can have consequences ??
[0:49:42] <Bruno_Tropical> YEAH KREIA KNOWS
[0:49:44] <+PlagueOfGripes> I actually like the conversation centered around Kreia, but I don't think the game ever reaches a 'correct' solution
[0:49:46] <%JJCheeker> They should have had a grey option
[0:49:51] <hellkhat> shes grey
[0:49:51] <countgaculatv> But Kreia, what if him dying now ends up with the hospital having a kidney at the right time to save little Timmy?
[0:49:52] <$QueequegTheater> yes
[0:49:54] <%startstoprepeat> like she said, she's your teacher.
[0:49:57] <wsintai> HMMMmmm....
[0:49:57] <%jiggy_snipe> Kreia doesn't like you having an effect on things
[0:49:58] <Fujiwara_92> YES
[0:49:58] <%JJCheeker> Maybe give him money and ask him to show you around
[0:49:58] <%DatAsuna> yes
[0:49:59] <FeralRageGaming> i tuned away for a minute, are they still discussing these morals??
[0:49:59] <$QueequegTheater> @hellkhat No, she's a cunt
[0:50:00] <%derap41> Woolie figured it out
[0:50:01] <+rider_megalon> yes
[0:50:03] <%startstoprepeat> and she wants you to be better than her.
[0:50:03] <+FadingEmber> Airs of Tell Tale
[0:50:04] <abelincoln_catpuncher> she totally is
[0:50:06] <QuantumButler> hmmm big thonk
[0:50:07] <hellkhat> LOL
[0:50:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> Pragmatism is a very narrow line to follow
[0:50:09] <+308caliber> the whole point is that your actions, good or bad, will have ripple effects
[0:50:10] <Reizie_Etherealm> There's no neutral option, they forced you to be either light or dark
[0:50:10] <+CaptainJax> woolie will figure it out
[0:50:11] <%JJCheeker> I don't like the either or
[0:50:12] <muniea3> she's everyones step mother, yes
[0:50:12] <StarlitStunner> She is your mom and teacher
[0:50:14] <+ShadowArcangel> This is one of my favourite scenes in video games and everyone here is hating damn LUL
[0:50:14] <%cylish> cylish subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:50:15] <Fujiwara_92> THAT'S THE POINT
[0:50:15] <heartlesshealer> Kreia would just zap robots
[0:50:16] <+rider_megalon> it's the grey way
[0:50:17] <%krispen_wa> but APATHY IS DEATH tho
[0:50:19] <Halospaz117> Now your learning
[0:50:23] <NotTheCoronaVirus> Kreia's philosophy isn't inherently wrong, but some fans act like it's being touted as truth in the game when they forget she's the FUCKING VILLAIN OF THE ENTIRE GAME, and she is revealed to be manipulative and lying.
[0:50:24] <+CaptainJax> APATHY IS DEATH
[0:50:24] <GarbageQueenEllie> She wants you to rationalize your decisions
[0:50:26] <+glgzephyr> @FeralRageGaming no they're just discussing why Kreia is a bitch
[0:50:26] <+MARTIANxMADNESS> She wants you to be a centrist
[0:50:27] <Bruno_Tropical> APATHY IS DEATH
[0:50:28] <dellis80> she is like every feminist I have ever talked to
[0:50:29] <+PlagueOfGripes> Kreia wants you to live for YOU, but while also inflicting as little harm as possible
[0:50:29] <%SouLucha> No.
[0:50:30] <%VCRUZZO> apathy death tho
[0:50:31] <+MARTIANxMADNESS> Let's just cut to the chase
[0:50:31] <%gatorafan> Apathy is death tho Kappa
[0:50:36] <siamzero94> I think she would have preferred you getting out of that with something gained
[0:50:37] <+glgzephyr> Apathy is death
[0:50:46] <lotharrio> Kreia is supposed to be the middle path. She wants you to follow it, too.
[0:50:48] <FeralRageGaming> she is a 5 credit penny pincher
[0:50:52] <ThalosTheSoviet> 3rd option would actually be 'ill pay you for information' and Kreia would praise you for that
[0:50:53] <YakumoYomi> She seems like she just wants you to exist as an island
[0:50:57] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @countgaculatv
[0:51:01] <Fujiwara_92> Apathy is death
[0:51:04] <%JJCheeker> Even if you ask him for something and he did it he still would have died
[0:51:05] <siamzero94> All Options were without any personal gains
[0:51:07] <QuantumButler> like with the previous guy, you gave him money, but you got valueable info and a possible informant
[0:51:09] <GarbageQueenEllie> She's a HARD centrist, Woolz
[0:51:11] <%SouLucha> Lol, I really hope Woolie does that Apathy rout.
[0:51:15] <%startstoprepeat> she doesn't want you to follow her path, she literally just told you she wants you to be better than her.
[0:51:19] <%GeneralSCPatton> She's pissed off by both extremes of the alignment system
[0:51:20] <Unicorngundam24> Is this a Star Wars Story?
[0:51:20] <Fujiwara_92> SHE'S HARD GREY WOOLZ
[0:51:29] <+PlagueOfGripes> Woolie's going to have a hard time if he keeps handing out sandwiches to hobos
[0:51:29] <heartlesshealer> boo kreia social link
[0:51:34] <countgaculatv> He who desires but acts not breeds Pestilence Kreia. It's written Kreia.
[0:51:39] <+TheFabledAble> she's setting up a devil's advocate for your moral position, because hard light and hard darkside paths are abhorrent to her, because she thinks blindly adhering to one path will lead you to making mistakes you could have otherwise avoided, she wants you to think for yourself so she constantly gives you shit for either pure charity or pure evil
[0:51:40] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus On DS runs she actually comes off more reasonable because she goes "what the fuck is wrong with you, stop slaughtering everyone to get your dick hard"
[0:51:44] <DisGuyOvahEre> that uis why gray jedi are stupid
[0:51:48] <+MARTIANxMADNESS> "Have you heard of the Horseshoe theory, Exile?" _ Kreia the centrist
[0:51:49] <NotTheCoronaVirus> Her argument isn't to just be grey nonsensically, because that's just as retarded as what she's fighting against. She dislikes the concept of marrying oneself to an ideology or oath to the extent that they cause misery to themselves and others.
[0:51:51] <%DatAsuna> "you aren't my real mom!"
[0:51:52] <MillaMoks> I wonder with the force bond, can she see the eye roll when she goes on another stupid example tangent Kappa
[0:52:07] <+glgzephyr> @MillaMoks she feels it
[0:52:07] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:52:07] <+Nobrev> light time
[0:52:12] <%HeavyMetalIceCream> the big dumb
[0:52:15] <Fuji808> @WoolieVersus Her lesson was literally asking you to be better than she was, my dude. She's not here to play devil's advocate as much as she's here to try to keep you from going hard light or hard dark.
[0:52:22] <MillaMoks> @glgzephyr perfect
[0:52:24] <%JJCheeker> To be fair she did say you should give things away only if they give you something in return
[0:52:36] <BurdRightsActivist> INFLUENCE LOST
[0:52:41] <+PlagueOfGripes> Kreia at this point is just like, Think motherfucker
[0:52:43] <%JJCheeker> If you would've asked for something she probably wouldn't care
[0:52:45] <countgaculatv> Kreia and light side points?
[0:52:46] <%Ashenik1> When Kreia yells at you whenever you do anything maybe she doestn want you to be like her but to think about your actions and their potential results ? :d
[0:52:48] <sw0rdmstr> I have to disagree on Kreia being better than Flemeth; Flemeth has a way darker sense of humor.
[0:52:54] <+CaptainJax> stop being light side exile
[0:52:56] <GarbageQueenEllie> And THAT is what she's trying to teach you. Good job, dude
[0:52:58] <+CaptainJax> stop being dark side exile
[0:53:01] <ashvsworld> "The Sith Disliked that"
[0:53:02] <+CaptainJax> stop being exile
[0:53:03] <DisGuyOvahEre> grey jedi are essentially the atheists of star wars. force adepts are way cooler as the agnostics of star wars
[0:53:06] <+glgzephyr> @MillaMoks she also feels what it's like inside Handmaiden while fuckfighting, so...
[0:53:08] <BurdRightsActivist> SW OMEGALUL OMEGALUL P BIKES

[1:01:43] <%VCRUZZO> LOL
[1:01:43] <%Ashenik1> @VCRUZZO my point of asking is it bad that the Force has some kind of independed will from any sentaint being? And when can we exatcly establish why when does it act? When Darth Vader changes side and saves Luke?

[1:05:30] <+rider_megalon> I'm watching Pat stream
[1:05:32] <%gatorafan> He likes the BIG murder
[1:05:35] <siamzero94> I mean it was funny
[1:05:39] <countgaculatv> Atton's murder boner grew
[1:05:41] <lotharrio> He mostly just wants you to be more subtle with your murder.
[1:05:44] <+glgzephyr> it WAS really funny
[1:05:45] <heartlesshealer> Blue boy likes murderous scam
[1:05:46] <Gruhunchously> Keep that in mind
[1:05:47] <Halospaz117> Atton is weird, cuz he gets ups for both LS and DS interactions
[1:05:49] <TDAWS_MP132> he was neutral

[1:05:55] <%SouLucha> This is explained later.
[1:06:09] <Gruhunchously> @Halospaz117 Yeah, Visas too.
[1:06:09] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:06:12] <Halospaz117> Handmaiden also likes it cuz in the end you did help that guy
[1:06:12] <$QueequegTheater> it doesn't even matter
[1:06:15] <Redblood801> Bao-Dur likes it if you don't do that
[1:06:20] <+wintrysoma> speaking of visas
[1:06:25] <%MeatBomb> You can justify anything with the FORCE. That's it's POWER.
[1:06:29] <WanderingSwordsman> Free falling!
[1:06:30] <+PlagueOfGripes> They got to ground much faster that way!
[1:06:31] <lotharrio> That pit probably opens up on the other side of the planet. They'll be fine.
[1:06:37] <Redblood801> If you actually fight them, he commends you for defending the guy
[1:06:38] <sw0rdmstr> Why is Woolie not using a lightsaber, did they not make one yet?
[1:06:39] <jamesthebrave> You freed their souls from gravity!
[1:06:48] <resloxxx> I dont think you understand the gravity of the situation @WoolieVersus
[1:06:51] <Redblood801> CHEEVOS
[1:06:52] <heartlesshealer> V is steering him to lightsaber
[1:06:53] <Halospaz117> So you get this weird moment where you brainwash two people to their deaths, then Handmaiden just goes "It's nice you are spreading kindness" or whatever
[1:06:53] <%gatorafan> Their splat into the ground will send positive echoes on the galaxy :)
[1:06:57] <xthomaswellertonx> do you believe in gravity?
[1:06:59] <siamzero94> Especially this one
[1:07:00] <GarbageQueenEllie> Handmaiden's an Echani-- she loves killing as long as you got HONOR
[1:07:01] <+prime_name> This Wookie is constantly pissed off.
[1:07:05] <Rosewater_444> g r av i t y is a p r o p e r t y of m a s s, not a f o r c e
[1:07:06] <+Nobrev> @sw0rdmstr they're on the way to getting one now
[1:07:08] <+taggerung403> they started with nar shadaa
[1:07:16] <%JJCheeker> Madness is like gravity all it takes is a little push
[1:07:24] <%krispen_wa> This creepy-ass furry
[1:07:25] <+cisealnine> I was really hoping that was Zalbaar during my first playthrough.
[1:07:34] <Gruhunchously> @GarbageQueenEllie The Echani and the Mandos are quite similar that way.
[1:07:35] <siamzero94> W/ever
[1:07:37] <%Parapattern> What atrocity has Woolie committed this week?
[1:07:37] <+PlagueOfGripes> Reject the beast's power, for it is not your own
[1:07:41] <$QueequegTheater> @Rosewater_444 It's both
[1:07:44] <Bruno_Tropical> LEAVE ZALBAAR ALONE THO
[1:07:46] <sw0rdmstr> @Nobrev That's strange. I actually got lightsaber earlier than this.

[1:13:41] <%Irridium> now what's in that box
[1:13:43] <+LtSergei> you could have just done the quest
[1:13:43] <$QueequegTheater> No
[1:13:45] <StarlitStunner> Activate blade time on his corpse
[1:13:46] <muniea3> he attacked me first!
[1:13:46] <+doc_ock_rokc> no
[1:13:47] <Redblood801> Yes
[1:13:48] <+wintrysoma> because that will trigger you know what
[1:13:49] <+taggerung403> NotLikeThis
[1:13:49] <%VCRUZZO> yes
[1:13:50] <Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus You could have just done his quest

[1:13:54] <+wunp_fxs> Yes
[1:13:56] <%TRILLTURBAN> WAITING IS BASICALLY THE WAY OF THE SITH
[1:13:56] <%MeatBomb> I want an orange-yellow lightsabre so hard, I'd lick a nerf-herder.
[1:13:57] <Fujiwara_92> LUL
[1:14:00] <%VCRUZZO> not that long
[1:14:05] <+balouie> you can get it in voggas place
[1:14:05] <%derap41> Light side hours from now
[1:14:08] <Bruno_Tropical> DARKSIDE IS QUICKER AND EASIER
[1:14:08] <siamzero94> Knowing your direction skill Woolie, tens of hours
[1:14:08] <Final_Cosplay_Corps> the universe does not have hours
[1:14:09] <%CyanDeadEye> Probably 15 minuttes
[1:14:15] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THERES NO TIME
[1:14:16] <Ravenian96> LIterally just 30 minutes tops lol
[1:14:17] <%JohnAtDawn> PEACE JUSTICE SECURITY AND FREEDOM
[1:14:18] <$Rezca> "hours"
[1:14:18] <outlawmap> More like 2 hours MAX
[1:14:20] <%krispen_wa> you could easily have done that wiyhin 15 min
[1:14:20] <CookieDoughFK> Wollie: I want a light-side playthrough Darth V: This is the true Light-side
[1:14:21] <ingman112> That’s not true
[1:14:21] <royb2> we need a lightsaber to establish communication and to terminate hostilities
[1:14:22] <Redblood801> Can't you just do the side quest
[1:14:22] <+Bluemanzee> NO TIME GOTTA KILL
[1:14:25] <raichu1972> >hours lol
[1:14:27] <manwithaxe> LASER STICK NOW
[1:14:27] <JetpackMcQuack> Light later, but that is too late
[1:14:27] <+cisealnine> That is a VARY long time to reap... justice.
[1:14:27] <jamesthebrave> I got a lightsaber on my first planet after like, an hour lol
[1:14:28] <ingman112> GOD DAMMIT
[1:14:29] <%JJCheeker> Maybe you should go back to the ship........
[1:14:32] <%VCRUZZO> about 2-3 hours
[1:14:32] <GarbageQueenEllie> :D
[1:14:33] <%Monkeyweed21> its like 1 side quest
[1:14:33] <Final_Cosplay_Corps> its my lightsaber anD i want it NOW
[1:14:37] <Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus pleas just do the sidequest
[1:14:38] <+balouie> steal it from the hutt
[1:14:38] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @heartlesshealer
[1:14:38] <Gruhunchously> Fann Y'Pak to his party members: "Leave us"
[1:14:39] <+PlagueOfGripes> it does raise the question, why didn't you just force pull the item out of his pocket
[1:14:42] <%SouLucha> NO FANNY, YOU WERE THE CHOOSEN ONE
[1:14:43] <+wintrysoma> actually v has a lightsaber part on her doesn't she
[1:14:44] <heartlesshealer> sorry moobot
[1:14:45] <therakishsage> I'm PRETTY SURE you can just get it literally one side quest.
[1:14:47] <xthomaswellertonx> kill this man for CONVINIENCE
[1:14:48] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> the musuc wont stop
[1:14:53] <siamzero94> Like half of next session
[1:14:55] <Scyllas> Or Force Choke to hold them.
[1:14:55] <+taggerung403> Quicker, easier, more seductive
[1:15:00] <%RJay80> logic = darkside
[1:15:05] <%VCRUZZO> wait how many parts did we have?
[1:15:07] <lotharrio> You just have to talk to a few people.
[1:15:09] <%VCRUZZO> do*
[1:15:10] <%Monkeyweed21> IS THIS EVEN A LIGHT SIDE PLAYTHROUGH
[1:15:13] <Reizie_Etherealm> As I stand upon this mountain of corpses slain by my hand, my fanny pack filled to burst with credits, my menus brimming with skill points, I scream at the top of my lungs "LIGHT LATERRR"
[1:15:18] <royb2> facilitate communications and terminate hostilities
[1:15:22] <ingman112> It would have literally taken you fifteen minutes
[1:15:22] <%RioGascar> Crazy twi- “IF I CANT FIND A FORCE PROBLEM, THEN I’ll MAKE ONE”
[1:15:23] <sw0rdmstr> A Jedi is one of those lockers.. I know it.
[1:15:24] <+Bluemanzee> This is the money side
[1:15:32] <%JohnAtDawn> TALK TO THAT GUY
[1:15:34] <%JJCheeker> Sometimes people on the light side make mistakes
[1:15:35] <%JohnAtDawn> GO BACK
[1:15:39] <WanderingSwordsman> it is a delayed light side playthrough
[1:15:40] <%JohnAtDawn> TALK TO ITHORIAN
[1:15:42] <%SouLucha> YOU ARE TAKING A PATH... We might actually follow. SeemsGood
[1:15:43] <siamzero94> @Monkeyweed21 Well Fann Y'Pak is big blue right now
[1:15:45] <ingman112> Dark for profit, fine. Dark for the lulz is just dumb
[1:15:50] <heartlesshealer> oh boy
[1:16:00] <CookieDoughFK> EVIL IS THE TRUE LIGHT-SIDE
[1:16:03] <+Nobrev> @monkeyweed21 if hes in the blue its still a light run

[1:16:24] <Gruhunchously> Standing here, I realize, you are just like me, trying to make history. But who's to judge the right from wrong. When our guard is down, I think we'll both agree that violence breeds violence, but in the end, it has to be this way.

[1:24:10] <+wintrysoma> you can see her face in the comic unseen unheard
[1:24:15] <Halospaz117> Seriously look up the art of Visas without her cowl thing, it's freaky

[1:28:35] <Gruhunchously> I kind of wish you hadn't done that, the game is easy enough as it is.
[1:28:36] <%JJCheeker> The off green one is great too
[1:28:36] <sw0rdmstr> Black saber is not in KOTOR2, correct?
[1:28:37] <uncledoodsauce> ja rule didn't even know?

[1:28:39] <heartlesshealer> Slice wasn't a great soda
[1:28:40] <ScreamLord> Broadsabers are better!
[1:28:41] <Ravenian96> Orange 100% looks better imo
[1:28:43] <GarbageQueenEllie> I like all 3 of the KOTOR2 waifus. They're awesome.
[1:28:44] <jorniev> TWIRL IT
[1:28:46] <heartlesshealer> oh!
[1:28:49] <heartlesshealer> fixed
[1:28:50] <hellkhat> try bronze
[1:28:52] <Fuji808> Also you can change the color whenever you want.
[1:28:52] <siamzero94> Bronze is redder
[1:28:53] <Tucker0603> ORANGE IS THE BEST
[1:28:53] <jorniev> THE POWER OF 3rd place
[1:28:56] <manwithaxe> orange looks bronze
[1:29:02] <hellkhat> i thought orange meant like techy
[1:29:06] <Prevot> almost but not quite red
[1:29:07] <lotharrio> Third place! Third place! Third place! Third place!
[1:29:07] <TomFrank> orange definitely tastes better than bronze
[1:29:09] <%DatAsuna> Orange is best this is true
[1:29:10] <Tucker0603> fucking fite me V, orange is the best
[1:29:11] <Redblood801> Wow, that mod made it look worse
[1:29:12] <Gruhunchously> Can we let Woolie just play the game now?
[1:29:12] <jamesthebrave> I've grown pretty fond of yellow recently
[1:29:13] <DracaenaLeaf> Good tastes
[1:29:15] <ScreamLord> Naruto
[1:29:18] <Bruno_Tropical> secondary colors
[1:29:19] <siamzero94> ok forget it guys
[1:29:20] <Fujiwara_92> do you woolz, we just saying it's cool
[1:29:21] <sw0rdmstr> Is the black saber in this game???
[1:29:21] <lotharrio> Why does Woolie like villain colors so much?
[1:29:22] <+FadingEmber> of course it is
[1:29:23] <%SomersaultJustice> orange is the color of darlington
[1:29:26] <GarbageQueenEllie> Woolie is a comic book villain confirmed
[1:29:28] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus thank you woolie for being a man of culture
[1:29:30] <$QueequegTheater> It's a mid-tier orange, like Skarlet
[1:29:30] <%jiggy_snipe> that's what he likes Naruto so much Kappa
[1:29:30] <jorniev> naruto man of course that makes sense
[1:29:31] <Fuji808> green purple orange naruto got it chief
[1:29:32] <+MaSterChiEfin420blntNinjA> Cmon guys it's color theory
[1:29:49] <jorniev> ALSO EVA 1 i forgot
[1:29:51] <+Bluemanzee> It's dirty Orange
[1:29:51] <nikoloas_> not great
[1:29:52] <%Parapattern> Beige
[1:29:53] <%TRILLTURBAN> They look the same to me
[1:29:53] <TomFrank> piss saber
[1:29:55] <dellis80> plaid is best
[1:29:56] <Tucker0603> THANK YOU WOOLZ, ORANGE RULES!!!!

[1:29:59] <+commanderclaw> Let him have his orange soda
[1:30:00] <Halospaz117> Wow that bronze is the blandest looking lightsaber I've ever seen
[1:30:00] <Reizie_Etherealm> Looks like brownish yellow, beige yeah
[1:30:01] <Lamokmok> Hey Woolie. Ooh picking your lightsaber already!
[1:30:03] <heartlesshealer> fixed orange is better yeah
[1:30:05] <%JJCheeker> It looks like piss
[1:30:09] <Fujiwara_92> you do you woolz, we just say it was cool
[1:30:18] <BurdRightsActivist> IT'S A RED SABER WOOLIE, You're EVILL
[1:30:21] <thefakethorr> SeemsGood SeemsGood
[1:30:22] <+wunp_fxs> more options in kotor2
[1:30:26] <MasterDecoder> Not gonna lie, Orange is better in this instance, with the color correction mod
[1:30:26] <%VCRUZZO> that is just a biege
[1:30:28] <Gruhunchously> You should talk to Kreia before you go
[1:30:34] <lotharrio> Two power crystals, and some DLC color crystals that also gave stats.
[1:30:37] <Ravenian96> Lightsabers hit like nukes in this game
[1:30:38] <+EternalJedi> rooH DUAL WIELDING
[1:30:40] <jorniev> IS there a black crystal?
[1:30:51] <+wintrysoma> I'd honestly prefer if red was just another colour that became arbitrariyl associated with the sith over the synthetic crystal/bleeding explanations
[1:31:00] <Maleicus> dlc color crystals?
[1:31:03] <$QueequegTheater> @Ravenian96 Nah, force lightning is literally actually broken
[1:31:09] <%DatAsuna> Boo dual wielding
[1:31:09] <$QueequegTheater> @jorniev no
[1:31:11] <CobaltPhoenix27> ok but hear me out... lightgauntlets
[1:31:11] <heartlesshealer> People liked bronze when the color correction was off, but mod is on, so Orange is great
[1:31:15] <jorniev> daaam
[1:31:16] <hellkhat> sith powers op
[1:31:20] <jorniev> sad
[1:31:25] <+MARTIANxMADNESS> Is there a what??? atpCarl
[1:31:27] <sw0rdmstr> @jorniev there's one in Force Unleashed hence why I asked.
[1:31:28] <Ravenian96> True literally everything is OP in this game tbh lol
[1:31:28] <%jiggy_snipe> lol
[1:31:28] <+CycloneEternalJoker> force storm ftw
[1:31:31] <%VCRUZZO> lol
[1:31:32] <$QueequegTheater> There is silver though
[1:31:34] <SoaringLettuce> light gauntlets are just the discs from Tron
[1:31:44] <+glgzephyr> they should sell that armor
[1:31:47] <%VCRUZZO> maybe there is mesh under it?
[1:32:02] <+Bluemanzee> Bao-Dur has a lightarm
[1:32:02] <Chisas_Dead_Body> M-E-ESH
[1:32:17] <CobaltPhoenix27> I just joined, is he not going for punch jedi anymore?
[1:32:23] <lotharrio> Only way you'll get a better vibrosword is if you luck into a tremor blade.
[1:32:36] <$QueequegTheater> @CobaltPhoenix27 he is but he also wants to fuck around
[1:32:38] <lotharrio> @CobaltPhoenix27 Punch Jedi is supposedly end game.
[1:32:38] <ScreamLord> @WoolieVersus There is a type of Lightsaber called a Broadsaber that is basically better in every way except you have to mind the edge alignment
[1:32:47] <Gruhunchously> I wonder if you can talk to Visas at this point without Handmaided getting mad...
[1:32:48] <heartlesshealer> He might be, but earliest lightsaber to get in the beamsword at least a bit
[1:32:48] <CobaltPhoenix27> ah ok thanks
[1:32:52] <%JJCheeker> I was so happy when I got my light Saber
[1:32:53] <+Nobrev> @cobaltphoenix27 doing PUNCH later on. they just went for an early saber
[1:32:58] <GarbageQueenEllie> The higher your skill, the less required parts needed. Best to leave it to droids/experts
[1:32:59] <jorniev> but remember woolie, there are plenty of ways to kill a jedi .
[1:33:05] <specificsongs> you exited the workbench out of editing to enter create. should you repop valor?
[1:33:10] <%JJCheeker> It takes so long
[1:33:14] <sw0rdmstr> Light-Buster-Sword would be cool to see.
[1:33:18] <%JJCheeker> To get
[1:33:25] <+Zanco23> @Gruhunchously Shoot, I just got back. Have they already met Visas?
[1:33:32] <+glgzephyr> deflection emitter tho
[1:33:42] <Gruhunchously> Yep
[1:33:47] <%JJCheeker> Yeah they just met her
[1:33:58] <+glgzephyr> shit I forgot about the adegan lens
[1:34:02] <Ravenian96> I talked to Visas before finishing Handmaiden sparring and Handmaiden never got locked out, but I have had her get locked before somehow
[1:34:18] <Gruhunchously> She'll show up the first time you return to the Ebon Hawk after her cutscene, so you can meet her quite fast.
[1:34:20] <GarbageQueenEllie> Hey, guys- VSauce here! I just tried to kill you!

[1:34:22] <$QueequegTheater> @Zanco23 just did
[1:34:23] <PROUD2beGINGER> Pontite Lens is awsome
[1:34:34] <+PlagueOfGripes> there are a lot of different dumb variants on lightsabers
[1:34:43] <lotharrio> I usually go with the offhand being defense or deflection focused.
[1:34:47] <sw0rdmstr> I definitely want to see a light-spear show up one day... handled by an actual spear fighter.

[1:35:10] <Gruhunchously> just talk to the wife, just a little...please...
[1:35:25] <Gruhunchously> ah well
[1:35:26] <$QueequegTheater> Use a drug
[1:35:26] <Lamokmok> Hey guys, who has Woolz already rectruited?
[1:35:30] <+glgzephyr> @sw0rdmstr hesitation is defeat
[1:35:32] <%Ashenik1> @VCRUZZO You know my whole deal was is something wrong with the Force being able to infulence people like Plague described. i just dont see what is wrong with misterous magic making plot go forward :p
[1:35:33] <PROUD2beGINGER> I believe you can get keen through other equipment
[1:35:36] <$QueequegTheater> @Lamokmok Visas, Handmaiden
[1:35:39] <CobaltPhoenix27> what's the max number of attacks you can do per turn? I know flurry gives more attacks, speed does as well, do they stack?
[1:35:41] <GarbageQueenEllie> You can talk to Visas, but only very briefly. Too much influence increase means cat fight
[1:35:49] <heartlesshealer> @QueequegTheater that's why Pathfinder and stuff puts Keen as a high level attribute now
[1:36:09] <Ravenian96> I believe a lightsaber form you learn gives you an additional attack per orund @CobaltPhoenix27
[1:36:26] <+Bluemanzee> Aren't there tiny lightsabers in this game?
[1:36:28] <lotharrio> @CobaltPhoenix27 Five at max. Master Speed gives two extra attacks, Master Flurry gives an extra attack and you can dual wield.
[1:36:30] <+Bluemanzee> Babysabers
[1:36:35] <+glgzephyr> Short Lightsabers
[1:36:35] <%VCRUZZO> @Ashenik1 you've played this game before?
[1:36:35] <lotharrio> At least I think.
[1:36:36] <CobaltPhoenix27> wow
[1:36:40] <sw0rdmstr> @glgzephyr Hey, I just prefer spear fights from kung fu movies more than disney.

[1:37:02] <CobaltPhoenix27> lightdaggers?
[1:37:10] <%Ashenik1> @VCRUZZO finished Kotor 1 and 2 once each
[1:37:11] <Lamokmok> Remind me, non-jedi can't use lightsabers right?
[1:37:24] <Ravenian96> Correct
[1:37:27] <+taggerung403> they can use lightsabers, just not well
[1:37:34] <jamesthebrave> They can use them, just badly most of the time
[1:37:36] <%VCRUZZO> @sw0rdmstr they have saber lances in Swtor Enternal Empire expansions
[1:37:36] <sw0rdmstr> @Lamokmok Yes, because General Grievous
[1:37:37] <lotharrio> @Lamokmok In the game? No. In lore, they're just a stupid weapon for most people.
[1:37:39] <+KillinSteals> im torn between YT and livestream
[1:37:45] <$QueequegTheater> You need the Force to fight other users or you're fucked
[1:37:52] <Gruhunchously> Wait, I wonder what will happen when they meet Loota's wife in the Refugee Sector. I don't know because I never MURDERED HIM.
[1:37:59] <heartlesshealer> Grievous had an organic heart, so unsure there
[1:38:01] <CookieDoughFK> You can use a lightsaber but what did it cost?
[1:38:02] <$QueequegTheater> @KillinSteals Twitch is over a week ahead of YT
[1:38:09] <+glgzephyr> we're not using crit strike
[1:38:13] <+glgzephyr> no poiint
[1:38:17] <CobaltPhoenix27> @CookieDoughFK you limbs
[1:38:20] <lotharrio> Keen is Keen.
[1:38:20] <CobaltPhoenix27> your*
[1:38:23] <$QueequegTheater> @Gruhunchously Not our fault you're inefficient
[1:38:42] <%GeneralSCPatton> There needs to be light gauntlets. Being able to catch a lightsaber, slide in close, and karate chop their head off would be rad.
[1:38:46] <Gruhunchously> Feel like in the Sith Academy all of a sudden
[1:38:50] <Ravenian96> You end up doing so much damage and taking so little you can literally do anything you want, the game isn't balanced
[1:38:51] <Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus you could use T3's comuter skill at a workbench to supplant your own skill level
[1:38:53] <%Ashenik1> @VCRUZZO I am not talking about Force being bad for people in the universe but as a thing that influences charactersr in the story
[1:38:59] <shutupandjam3465> So are the power moves really better than flurry? Because i always felt like getting more hits was better
[1:39:15] <%VCRUZZO> @Ashenik1 right I got ya
[1:39:23] <lotharrio> @shutupandjam3465 Power Attack beats out Flurry, as long as you hit every attack.
[1:39:24] <$QueequegTheater> @shutupandjam3465 Max power attack gives triple damage on crits
[1:39:32] <yeildingthought> Kotor: one more level. LUL
[1:39:45] <+glgzephyr> we need to use critical strike if we're building a crit saber
[1:39:48] <GarbageQueenEllie> I liked the jolt cells back in the day. Fucking expensive, though. Energy and crit is probably better than electric damage
[1:39:49] <CobaltPhoenix27> is there any ever instance of someone using the force to crush someone's internal organs? like a heart or a brain?
[1:39:50] <+glgzephyr> otherwise there's no point
[1:39:59] <jamesthebrave> It's funny, when I played this as a kid I
[1:40:07] <lotharrio> Windu did it in the Gendy cartoon.
[1:40:09] <shutupandjam3465> Damn, ok thanks guys. I've been playing it wrong all these years. I gues it doesnt really matter though, since ither way is broken lol
[1:40:12] <Gruhunchously> Maybe we could take Handmaided out into the world to get some influence with her.
[1:40:15] <$QueequegTheater> @glgzephyr Power attack is actually better than crit strike
[1:40:23] <sw0rdmstr> Watching this makes me want to play DA:O more than Kotor 1 or 2.
[1:40:24] <jamesthebrave> 'd had literally no experience with tabletop stats and shit, so all the stat building was confusing as hell

[1:41:04] <$QueequegTheater> +16 TO HIT
[1:41:13] <Lamokmok> Have they messed around with lightsaber forms yet?
[1:41:15] <GarbageQueenEllie> And Kreia says you shouldn't make a lightsaber. What a hack!
[1:41:16] <nivlac_555> lol
[1:41:17] <siamzero94> Jesus Christ
[1:41:18] <sw0rdmstr> Not that I'm bored or anything, DA:O just seems more refined than the others.
[1:41:25] <theKingRamses> yeah how about them lightsaber forms
[1:41:25] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[1:41:27] <+MARTIANxMADNESS> 3.5e numbers go crazy. By the end you have +40 to hit
[1:41:33] <EvanTsilimidos> Hey Woolz!
[1:41:34] <%derap41> Now we can get laid
[1:41:35] <Gruhunchously> Actually, it's probably best that they got the saber now, before that one bit that's coming
[1:41:37] <Fujiwara_92> +16 to hit is nothing... Later I was +27 to hit LUL
[1:41:45] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> GREATER GOOD
[1:41:46] <lotharrio> Kreia is going to try and shame you over your murder penis.
[1:41:46] <$QueequegTheater> @sw0rdmstr FUnny, watching this makes me want to go build weapons in Fallout 4

[1:44:48] <dorpork> kotor 2 didn't invent miraluka though they greatly expanded on them
[1:44:53] <%BallerSwagBro9k> They were in the comics
[1:44:54] <GarbageQueenEllie> It's called Near-Human, there's a lot of those races in the EU
[1:44:58] <+PlagueOfGripes> what are the bendu monks? Haha never mind that

[1:57:07] <$QueequegTheater> She was just offscreen
[1:57:10] <BlackMage66652> Pockets Force-Pushed her way out of the womb
[1:57:10] <lotharrio> Pretty sure it's viewable right now, through the video tab.
[1:57:11] <GarbageNirvana> Not like you really gotta look her in the eyes
[1:57:16] <+wintrysoma> thousand light year stare
[1:57:18] <%JohnAtDawn> MONEY
[1:57:22] <+PlagueOfGripes> some say he's trapped in a jail cell somewhere, and when he dies, only one half of him will leave
[1:57:40] <%DatAsuna> No spoilers
[1:57:41] <jorniev> THE FORCE
[1:57:41] <Ravenian96> FUCK I hate SWTOR
[1:57:48] <$QueequegTheater> @PlagueOfGripes We don't talk about that
[1:57:48] <%MeatBomb> Pockets.... Pockets always deeper.
[1:57:49] <Vash_estampida> is Revan female if you chose to play a male exiled jedi in KotOR 2?
[1:57:52] <BlackMage66652> @PlagueOfGripes And then galaxy domination because fuck it
[1:57:58] <%CyanDeadEye> No, they chose dark side female
[1:58:03] <shutupandjam3465> @lotharrio Awesome! Thanks!
[1:58:06] <%Monkeyweed21> Kreia was Tposing off camera
[1:58:08] <%Irridium> @Vash_estampida you get to choose in the beginning
[1:58:08] <DSD24> @Vash_estampida You can pick at the beginning
[1:58:08] <muniea3> T posing in noclip land
[1:58:09] <$QueequegTheater> @Vash_estampida No, you choose which gender in a dialogue prompt with Atton
[1:58:09] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Vash_estampida You get to choose via dialogue
[1:58:14] <CobaltPhoenix27> @Vash_estampida at the beginning in dialogue you pick
[1:58:15] <jorniev> nanomachi- i mean THE FORCE
[1:58:16] <Vash_estampida> aaaah
[1:58:17] <Gruhunchously> @Vash_estampida You choose Revan's gender and alignment in the beginning
[1:58:23] <%JohnAtDawn> CASH
[1:58:32] <Vash_estampida> I completely forgot that
[1:58:33] <Zebroneath> Cash money is a strong motivator
[1:58:34] <GarbageNirvana> You know what's really dark? All that space in these POCKETS
[1:58:34] <+wintrysoma> lods of emone
[1:58:42] <%MeatBomb> Did the Force eat my space hamster again?
[1:58:44] <%Irridium> true to dem... pockets
[1:58:46] <siamzero94> No, she wasn't a monster? She forced a man to kill his own son in his underwear
[1:58:48] <JetpackMcQuack> Npcs still falling
[1:58:49] <BlackMage66652> @PlagueOfGripes You leave SWTOR Revan in the toilet where he belongs!
[1:58:49] <PROUD2beGINGER> True to THESE POCKETS
[1:58:50] <Gruhunchously> Pockets was a false face the whole time
[1:58:56] <%JohnAtDawn> THIS IS THE ONLY THING KREIA SAYS TAHT I WILL BACK
[1:58:57] <$QueequegTheater> That is disgusting close to an accurate description of Pockets
[1:58:59] <lotharrio> Pockets is robbing casinos in another galaxy, murdering teenagers with her wookie slave.
[1:58:59] <Camail> Revan looked really evil, veiny, and sithy
[1:59:03] <%CyanDeadEye> Or was she brainwashed by a Sith Lord in another part of the galaxy and sent to conquer the Republic
[1:59:05] <royb2> Revan became the dark lord to get rich
[1:59:07] <%derap41> ....Nah it was the money
[1:59:07] <CobaltPhoenix27> THE GREATER GOOD
[1:59:09] <CookieDoughFK> THE GREATER GOOD
[1:59:09] <+Nobrev> granny if you dont stop talking in circles I'm gonna beat your ass
[1:59:09] <GarbageQueenEllie> Becoming the Dark Lord of the Sith for lots of money is such a ridiculous idea. Love it
[1:59:10] <Gruhunchously> Remember, strong emotions, like GREED, can mask one's true feelings.
[1:59:14] <xthomaswellertonx> nah it was money
[1:59:15] <Camail> my revan made a wookie kill his best friend...that was evil
[1:59:17] <jamesthebrave> So basically Revan was the coolest and the strongest, got it
[1:59:20] <+CaptainJax> THE GREATER GOOD(s)
[1:59:26] <Nested_Dreams> Pockets? Sacrifice? But that doesn't pay...
[1:59:31] <muniea3> Darth Revan did nothing wrong
[1:59:32] <%BallerSwagBro9k> REVAN WAS LELOUCH
[1:59:32] <%CyanDeadEye> Darth Vitate
[1:59:37] <CobaltPhoenix27> revan made carth kill his son while naked for the greater good guys
[1:59:41] <%DatAsuna> Cyan shut the fuck up with the spoilers
[1:59:44] <+308caliber> What’s the greater evil? Something beyond the outer rim?
[1:59:44] <JetpackMcQuack> LIGHT LATER
[1:59:46] <%derap41> Don't you see she had to be evil
[1:59:48] <YakumoYomi> @BallerSwagBro9k OH SHIT
[1:59:59] <%DatAsuna> This is why they should ignore chat
[1:59:59] <Ravenian96> Too bad we'll never figure out what happened to such a great dude
[2:00:00] <lotharrio> Yuuzhan Vong!
[2:00:02] <+glgzephyr> NotLikeThis
[2:00:07] <GarbageNirvana> The ultimate Light Later choice
[2:00:09] <jorniev> RENEGADE FOR LIFE
[2:00:10] <BlackMage66652> Revan was Shinji's dad
[2:00:15] <SinnerBeta> no, it was related to true sith
[2:00:19] <+doc_ock_rokc> Greater Goods
[2:00:28] <GarbageQueenEllie> It's all the Dark Triad, man...
[2:00:30] <jorniev> the greater good
[2:00:35] <shutupandjam3465> D oes anyone not caount swotor as canon? I hate what they did with the plot of this game
[2:00:38] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @ravenian96 read the book. But prepare for dissapointment
[2:00:49] <ThatGuyThere03> YUP
[2:00:52] <$QueequegTheater> Yes
[2:00:53] <+wunp_fxs> yep!
[2:00:57] <Blazeofflame> shit, i left for 4 mins, what's the quick rundown of what Krea just said?
[2:00:59] <+PlagueOfGripes> what? the jedi council being stupid? what??
[2:01:03] <BlackMage66652> Book Revan is fine, SWTOR Revan sucks
[2:01:05] <%CyanDeadEye> Its best to ignore SWTOR if you like KoTOR and KoTOR II
[2:01:05] <arran_throttle> holy f, yes
[2:01:07] <SinnerBeta> no
[2:01:22] <shutupandjam3465> @CyanDeadEye ok thanks. glad someone said it
[2:01:23] <GarbageQueenEllie> Let's not forget that the council DESTROYED HER BRAIN
[2:01:27] <$QueequegTheater> @Blazeofflame the Jedi Council were extremely lucky that Revan fell to the Dark Side
[2:01:27] <lotharrio> @Blazeofflame Kreia was all, "Revan needed to fall to the Dark Side to prevent something worse."
[2:01:27] <Ravenian96> I read the SWTOR wiki when I need a good laugh
[2:01:28] <YakumoYomi> But SWTOR Holocron Bastilla is hot, tho
[2:01:33] <redrins> amelie
[2:01:34] <%DatAsuna> It's best to not launch into dropping huge spoilers every time the word revan is uttered
[2:01:34] <GarbageNirvana> Stop praying for grandpa
[2:01:38] <redrins> just let everybody die
[2:01:42] <$QueequegTheater> LUL
[2:01:44] <+PlagueOfGripes> survival of the fittest for kreia
[2:01:46] <+cvp5127> THEN RUN
[2:01:51] <Blazeofflame> @QueequegTheater @lotharrio ty fams
[2:01:57] <$QueequegTheater> "And then she came on me"
[2:02:01] <xthomaswellertonx> she shocked t3
[2:02:03] <%MeatBomb> Jedi SUCK! VADER did NOTHING wrong.
[2:02:16] <+doc_ock_rokc> hue hue hue
[2:02:17] <Gruhunchously> That fool Zhar
[2:02:20] <siamzero94> the twilek

[2:02:30] <lotharrio> Mooka... shaka paka.
[2:02:35] <YakumoYomi> Ja didn't know
[2:02:36] <shutupandjam3465> Why does kreia hate zhar?
[2:02:36] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:02:38] <GarbageQueenEllie> Kreia has the sickest burns
[2:02:40] <StarlitStunner> The red twilek guy
[2:02:43] <+wintrysoma> from my point of view the jedi are naughty
[2:02:47] <Gruhunchously> Well, it was before the Mandalorian Wars
[2:02:49] <+doc_ock_rokc> Woolie....she was on dantuine
[2:02:51] <%JohnAtDawn> Kreia talking about Revan is the only part of her dialogue that I will always take as truth
[2:02:52] <%VCRUZZO> here we go
[2:02:54] <sw0rdmstr> She just mentioned that she's Revan's master right?
[2:02:56] <%VCRUZZO> say it
[2:02:58] <%VCRUZZO> ask it
[2:02:59] <%JohnAtDawn> REVAN WAS POWER
[2:03:02] <%RJay80> pockets was POWER personified
[2:03:02] <sadbarbarian> God Kreia is so fucking good
[2:03:04] <CobaltPhoenix27> would say... UNLIMITED power?
[2:03:09] <hellkhat> thats awesome
[2:03:11] <+PlagueOfGripes> part of the problem with basing a whole galaxy's story around like 10 people is when you need to flesh out that time frame, you get problems like that
[2:03:17] <$QueequegTheater> Well the Exile has a dick
[2:03:20] <jorniev> NO SPOILERS kreia!

[2:03:40] <shutupandjam3465> Guys does anyone know why kreia hates zhar so much?
[2:03:41] <GarbageNirvana> Well when you consider where the entire Star Wars franchise went from here
[2:03:58] <Halospaz117> I think you have to ask her about the force
[2:04:05] <heartlesshealer> Influence gained
[2:04:07] <%DatAsuna> @shutupandjam3465 she's generally a bit of a racist as well as being anti jedi
[2:04:10] <lotharrio> Miraluka. From the Spanish mira, to look, and looker, a person who looks.
[2:04:11] <Halospaz117> I think that mental training will go further if you ask her about force training
[2:04:11] <$QueequegTheater> I'm a big deal
[2:04:12] <Ravenian96> Kreia generally hates all the jedi masters for being pompous
[2:04:12] <QuantumButler> Sike! you thought we'd be doing stuff on a planet but it's back to podcast time on the Ebon Hawk
[2:04:13] <shutupandjam3465> ah ok fair
[2:04:14] <sw0rdmstr> THE BIGGEST THING I WANT FROM KOTOR3 (if it ever happens) IS SITH VAMPIRES!
[2:04:16] <%MeatBomb> Muku shaka paka? muku shaka laka... Dank.

[2:04:54] <lotharrio> Handmaiden is locked on level. Gotta be 15 for the next one.
[2:04:58] <Halospaz117> @WoolieVersus I think to continue the mental training stuff with Kreia, you need to ask her about force training instead of the regular question tree
[2:05:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[2:05:11] <+doc_ock_rokc> @QueequegTheater Lith

[2:05:40] <CookieDoughFK> Force Goblins, they start in your mind but warp into being real

[2:06:00] <+PlagueOfGripes> Don't be tempted by her groin prison
[2:06:02] <Ravenian96> Be nice to my wife
[2:06:05] <nikoloas_> Big Tiddie Sith GF
[2:06:08] <+Zeromaru2> I wonder Why?
[2:06:08] <%alrobot2014> this is why kreia immediately tells you not to fuck her
[2:06:10] <Prevot> oh god she's blind and her name is visas
[2:06:11] <Rangenade> visas is hot and i luv her and she cute
[2:06:12] <Gruhunchously> Look at how blue Handmaiden is.
[2:06:13] <heartlesshealer> Her design is real good, not surprised you'd see cosplay
[2:06:26] <muniea3> now I know to make docking port jokes to cosplayers
[2:06:37] <+roxikat> roxikat subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:06:40] <%MeatBomb> When is best boy time?
[2:06:44] <sw0rdmstr> I've been wanting Sith Vampires since Episode III
[2:07:00] <%JohnAtDawn> Kiritsugu Woolie
[2:07:06] <sw0rdmstr> Before there was a sequel trilogy.
[2:07:08] <Gruhunchously> Hmm
[2:07:09] <%derap41> Oh Watchmen was soo good
[2:07:10] <%roxikat> This has been a fantastic playthrough so far.
[2:07:20] <%LiveStreamOnyx> @prevot not your average blind, she got no eyes.....empty sockets
[2:07:25] <Gruhunchously> I just wish they said hi to Visas.
[2:07:31] <%derap41> Like I thought they couldn't match the comic but they did
[2:07:36] <Gruhunchously> I'm pretty sure it would be safe at this point
[2:07:40] <+wintrysoma> @LiveStreamOnyx specifically ripped open empty sockets
[2:07:50] <%RJay80> it does what it do. it interface the speeding air
[2:07:57] <SinnerBeta> highly doubt that, Revan stopped the Mandalorians but started the Jedi Civil War, probably resulting in more death than Jedi waiting a bit longer to join would result
[2:08:01] <+PlagueOfGripes> 32-22-36
[2:08:05] <+prime_name> I need titty robot art on my desk by tomorrow
[2:08:05] <pipboy344> Has Woolie literally been playing all day?
[2:08:12] <Ravenian96> @Gruhunchously I think they are safe, or one influence with Handmaiden away from being safe
[2:08:14] <dorpork> why ddo they skip non-humn dialogue?
[2:08:16] <$QueequegTheater> @pipboy344 yes
[2:08:17] <jorniev> TT

[2:08:26] <SuperChumps> admNuke admNuke admNuke admNuke admNuke
[2:08:27] <Gruhunchously> Because they're racist
[2:08:28] <+wintrysoma> @dorpork because it's insufferable
[2:08:28] <%derap41> Don't think about it
[2:08:53] <siamzero94> Tien fell on some hard times

[2:09:47] <+wintrysoma> wow, never seen this since bao dur bores me
[2:09:49] <Gruhunchously> So, we have Nien Nubb, and here's Tien Tubb. And the Sullustan on Peragus was called Sien...Subb?
[2:09:54] <Chatterbox1991> o.o ive never seen this
[2:09:54] <Prevot> this sounds like an american pretending to speak italian really fast
[2:09:57] <sw0rdmstr> It took me so long to realize that Bao Dur is of the same race as Maul.
[2:10:14] <MasterDecoder> I never knew that exchange existed
[2:10:14] <GarbageQueenEllie> BIG-EARS here might know how to change the Hawk's ID signature
[2:10:16] <muniea3> is that Turkish?
[2:10:18] <Ravenian96> Bao-dur got them silent rage whispers
[2:10:21] <Fuji808> Japan Hates Tienn
[2:10:32] <$QueequegTheater> @sw0rdmstr If you get Bao-Dur to go DS it becomes very extremely obvious
[2:10:38] <%derap41> Go fing the blue card
[2:11:07] <Gruhunchously> That Bao conversation is restored content, by the way
[2:11:08] <%RJay80> sir is it possible to talk without moving your mouth
[2:11:10] <jorniev> sanic
[2:11:16] <sw0rdmstr> @QueequegTheater I did not know that.
[2:11:17] <+ShadowArcangel> you can also get a discount here..for the greater good
[2:11:37] <%MeatBomb> Whenever I buy form the space penis aliens, I always get more than I bargained for. BrainSlug
[2:11:38] <MasterDecoder> @Gruhunchously That's why I didn't know about it then, ok
[2:11:38] <$QueequegTheater> @sw0rdmstr Yeah, physical apearance changes with the organics you drag down with you
[2:11:40] <damienlunas> Sell Atton's "Ribbed For Her Pleasure" Jacket
[2:12:08] <$QueequegTheater> Good armor you'll never use
[2:12:31] <SinnerBeta> @damienlunas blasphemy
[2:12:34] <sw0rdmstr> @QueequegTheater It's been awhile since I played it.
[2:12:37] <Gruhunchously> Why would his jacket need to be ribbed...oh...I just had a mental image
[2:12:50] <muniea3> mando heavy is light though
[2:13:00] <GarbageQueenEllie> Bow chicka bow wow
[2:13:02] <%CyanDeadEye> The duality of equipment
[2:13:23] <lotharrio> Just stealing her memento of her father and selling it so you can buy a rock.
[2:13:36] <%VCRUZZO> @Gruhunchously please, share curios minds want to know bitterGasm bitterGasm woolieGASM woolieGASM
[2:13:47] <Gruhunchously> grinding

[2:14:25] <Ravenian96> I grind item rerolls until i get the crystals/robes i want lol
[2:14:27] <%VCRUZZO> oh I jst realized they still had those
[2:14:37] <GarbageQueenEllie> @lotharrio Such is the plight of npcs. Party gear defies continuity.
[2:14:48] <Ravenian96> In as single player game that by default you are overpowered
[2:14:51] <jorniev> question, can he still hear the other toughts of the other characters?
[2:15:03] <Gruhunchously> Only at certain points
[2:15:13] <%VCRUZZO> get rid of the majority of shite from Peragus
[2:15:13] <$QueequegTheater> But in-character, always
[2:15:31] <Gruhunchously> Mira's are great thouhg
[2:15:49] <Gruhunchously> We should wait until we get her before we do the mind reading stuff
[2:16:24] <Gruhunchously> But Atton's are the best
[2:16:51] <shutupandjam3465> attons are definitely the best. Such an interesting party member
[2:16:51] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule

[2:17:58] <Ravenian96> Umm technically it's speciesm hunny
[2:18:01] <alexandrecau> Can a rpg party not have a huge ass racist among them?
[2:18:06] <%VCRUZZO> big discounts
[2:18:14] <GarbageQueenEllie> Racism in games is so funny
[2:18:14] <$QueequegTheater> It's a war economy, Jack
[2:18:29] <siamzero94> Woolie "That alien is so ugly" complaining is precious
[2:18:51] <lotharrio> "Well, a droid is property."
[2:18:51] <+Bluemanzee> Even the robot is racist wow
[2:19:00] <Gruhunchously> HK is the biggest racist of all though
[2:19:03] <alexandrecau> Like you go on adventure than your healer says something about the not jews and realize you go to do some sidequest before moving on
[2:19:05] <CobaltPhoenix27> it's not like I liked him b-baka

[2:34:09] <Ravenian96> Kreia doesn't care about machines
[2:34:11] <+Estuko> Fun fact: the game StarBound there's a robot race called Glitch and their manner of talking is just like HK-47's, beautifully done.
[2:34:12] <jorniev> hk has 300 counts of self defense
[2:34:13] <damienlunas> Flimsy Justification: This meatbag's appearance was an assault on my optical circuitry. I had no choice but to end this unfettered assault lest I suffer permanent damage.

[2:40:54] <%derap41> @subjectg This run is more about reliving the old run
[2:40:57] <siamzero94> @glgzephyr But there is already a huge amount of Light points
[2:41:05] <Gruhunchously> @Ravenian96 Did you gain influence with him? That can change his alignment.
[2:41:08] <KaseKaizer> LUL
[2:41:19] <+glgzephyr> @siamzero94 I meant in number of interactions, not point value
[2:41:21] <%MeatBomb> Can we start an IG-88 appreciation HypeGriffin1

[2:41:29] <VJdarkworld> hm
[2:41:30] <$QueequegTheater> @Ravenian96 Apparently it can change the color but has no story or gameplay effect
[2:41:33] <Ravenian96> yep I have big influence with him
[2:41:40] <Ravenian96> yeah he is still a murder hobo
[2:41:41] <+glgzephyr> NPCs, he's being a little bit Light Later with

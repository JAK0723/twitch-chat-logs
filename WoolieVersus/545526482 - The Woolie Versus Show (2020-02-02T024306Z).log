[0:40:08] <+MrAtheGreat> Big Brain was fine. but then I liked the Tokyo Mirage Session #FE playthrough so maybe I'm weird.
[0:40:08] <@Solidus_113> They did that on the first stream with LittleV
[0:40:10] <Atticus_Rex> "It's 4 in the morning and we're just wrapping up monopoly..."
[0:40:16] <hntronium> Didn't they play mario party already?

[0:41:16] <Reizie_Etherealm> Better safe than sorry
[0:41:25] <powerprotoman> so woolz if you want the SALTIEST of parties i recomend dokapon kingdom, warning there is a story mode and you can pull some scumbag shit because its a hostile mario party with rpg battles instead of minigames
[0:41:28] <arkv01> whats going on with the podcast mic setups?
[0:41:35] <%Solidnick18> don't turn off again FeelsBadMan
[0:41:40] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> hey alright
[0:41:45] <Superdandy96> Again? Aw come on dad Kappa
[0:41:47] <+MrAtheGreat> Could just be the res down and not the res up
[0:41:50] <dapperskeleton69> tank!
[0:41:55] <zenith0111> TANK
[0:41:56] <Reizie_Etherealm> Time is the only thing at stake here, it depends on how much you value that
[0:42:00] <dapperskeleton69> tank?
[0:42:08] <SheefEatsBeef> dokapon is amazing

[0:42:14] <Triplicat> dokapon kingdom is LONG
[0:42:15] <+MrAtheGreat> @powerprotoman THAT SOUNDS FANTASTIC
[0:42:16] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> reading is fundamental.
[0:42:18] <%Solidnick18> dokapon is pretty long tho
[0:42:21] <zenith0111> DOKAPON HELL YES
[0:42:21] <zayasu> PogChamp PogChamp
[0:42:26] <gustavozxd> dokapon is the most evil, Mario party is NOTHING next to it
[0:42:29] <+MrAtheGreat> Guns made be pulled, murders may be committed
[0:42:36] <+Lord_Scrublet> 4 players for maximal suffering
[0:42:37] <SomersaultJustice> that game is great, but it takes like a billion years to play one game
[0:42:40] <SheefEatsBeef> it's hand off the controller style
[0:42:40] <powerprotoman> its on wii as well
[0:42:41] <%Prevot> isn't it on Wii too?
[0:42:42] <ll_aja_ll> did you hear aboutthe W101 kickstarter?

[0:42:48] <SomersaultJustice> there's a wii version for 4 players
[0:42:52] <%Solidnick18> it's super long but very evil
[0:42:57] <arkv01> you can RAWtap it
[0:43:07] <+ggbhtg> I missed doodBigBrain Academy? I have sadness.
[0:43:08] <@Solidus_113> Game Audio is choppy again

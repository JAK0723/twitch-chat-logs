[0:09:06] <Aussie_Manny> dang it, mama
[0:09:18] <Prevot> she looks way older than 4
[0:09:26] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Kappa
[0:09:27] <Aussie_Manny> booo
[0:09:37] <psudonym> Chapter 3 is Fragile
[0:09:37] <+locutus_of_the_porg> did woolie take the chiral artist into the hot springs
[0:09:43] <+gamerboy385> the hell are you dicks talking about Mama being 4??
[0:09:44] <Prevot> but is IS a japanese game so who knows

[0:21:52] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> OH HES BEEN TRUCKIN
[0:21:56] <Aussie_Manny> Yeh, BTs are actually bitches.
[0:21:56] <+Razputin217> TRUCKIN'
[0:21:58] <%ChoculaUltra> mules are literally the assholes who steal packages off porches having 0 clue if they're stealing bad dragon orders or a friggin laptop
[0:21:58] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> see that road lines
[0:22:11] <Aussie_Manny> BTs are just good for crystal farming. LUL
[0:22:12] <detritus25> Hidious. It's perfect.
[0:22:21] <Baconbot9000> lmao @choculaultra
[0:22:22] <%Ecchigun> we back in
[0:22:25] <Aussie_Manny> @detritus25 Hideo-s.
[0:22:36] <gade177> He basically is.
[0:23:36] <Baconbot9000> Ty based woolie
[0:24:28] <Baconbot9000> give me dialog, yes Jebaited Jebaited
[0:24:30] <+LandOfTheWay> oh yeah, this mission
[0:25:18] <Prevot> woolie is turning sam into a melee player
[0:25:22] <gade177> There's another settlement that needs your help i'll mark it on your map.
[0:25:39] <jaiperson> guess they also have to get that AXE collab going, too
[0:25:55] <zafooru> dont drop those PIZZAS
[0:26:13] <+GarbageNirvana> Bots will always drop the pizzas
[0:26:16] <psudonym> The Cosplayer :3
[0:26:37] <gade177> Death Stranding=walking simulator.
[0:26:38] <NotHereToStream> sticky guns are underrated
[0:26:59] <jaiperson> yeah but that Ebola gun is real easy to use
[0:27:11] <%jinking79> really don't like the pizza missions
[0:27:13] <Hellarussian> how many Funko Pops has Sam delivered?
[0:27:19] <psudonym> Sticky Guns are super handy. I've gotten a little creative with using them aggressively too. Grab a junk item off a mule and throw it right back at them.
[0:27:22] <zafooru> the pizza mission payoff is the best though
[0:27:39] <Prevot> ebola gun sounds like what pat has nightmares about
[0:27:46] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> shhh woolie will find out about it
[0:27:53] <psudonym> sorry!
[0:28:08] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> i meant the pizza mission
[0:28:10] <Baconbot9000> ebola gun would get banned by pat back in the day
[0:28:12] <psudonym> ah
[0:28:21] <Aussie_Manny> Several dozen kilos?! sooshD
[0:28:21] <gade177> Is there like...gameplay in this?
[0:28:27] <zafooru> T e t h e r G r a b
[0:28:29] <psudonym> It's a spider-man web shot gun
[0:28:29] <%Brickhaus_> Brickhaus_ subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:28:30] <Aussie_Manny> @gade177 Not really.
[0:28:35] <%jinking79> the Snatcher
[0:28:39] <%Irridium> It's a cargo gun. Use it to nab cargo from a good ways away
[0:28:43] <gade177> Damn it Kojima.
[0:28:44] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> how is this not gameplay tho
[0:28:51] <Aussie_Manny> This is logistics.
[0:28:52] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:28:59] <+Razputin217> How do I shot web?
[0:29:05] <Prevot> don't tell me the sticky gun ammo is made from Sam's...
[0:29:11] <gade177> It's basically pause screen that's not gameplay.
[0:29:17] <Aussie_Manny> @Prevot Ear wax, yes.
[0:29:18] <psudonym> To grab something in mid air, you need to let go of the aim and trigger button for a moment. To ready your hands for the catch.
[0:29:31] <+ATentacleMonster> gameplay has to be shooting guns and new areas or it's bad with the modern crowd :^)
[0:29:39] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> but if you want you can just call it walking sim since thats what people say
[0:30:00] <Aussie_Manny> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli It's a walking sim with crazy fucking story every 5 hours.
[0:30:05] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> even tho youd probably spend half the game driving or trekking ghosts
[0:30:08] <gade177> It is basically walking sim and every game needs action and lots of it.
[0:30:10] <Hellarussian> can BB be used as a projectile to rough up BTs?
[0:30:11] <Baconbot9000> odds woolie looks at chat in real time: exceedingly low
[0:30:12] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> and you fight enemies
[0:30:17] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> but sure walking sim
[0:30:21] <+invisi_bliss> ooh new camera set up
[0:30:26] <Aussie_Manny> Walking sim. üëç
[0:30:35] <BurdRightsActivist> Imagine READING CHAT
[0:30:50] <jaiperson> yeah it's more like action/open world game with Walkingsim dna into it
[0:30:52] <Aussie_Manny> @BurdRightsActivist sooshHm

[0:31:24] <gade177> Notice me senpai!
[0:31:24] <jaiperson> I'm JEAN MAN
[0:31:36] <Baconbot9000> Hey Reggie do you read chat or do we exist just to be punished and neglected?
[0:31:59] <Aussie_Manny> Being neglected is our reward! :D
[0:32:00] <NotHereToStream> wtf i expected walking, wtf is this driving shit
[0:32:04] <jaiperson> they call me jean man because I used to wear jeans, but then I got burned like jeanne d'arc
[0:32:05] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> they're recording an lp, minimal chat interaction
[0:32:06] <+chesterr01> I rarely look
[0:32:13] <jaiperson> I'm a tragic character
[0:32:13] <%jinking79> 600 kg is beyond to truck lvl
[0:32:15] <gade177> Driving? NANI?!!!
[0:32:30] <Aussie_Manny> Oh shit, right, this is technically LP recording. This is going to Youtube
[0:32:32] <gade177> ip?
[0:32:36] <its_not_arco> This game to me was a trucking simulator. Walking was for plebs.
[0:32:43] <gade177> Oh lp

[0:37:30] <bevyrage> i tune in and see woolie decimating a camp of postal junkies
[0:37:32] <gade177> I've hit some people with my car-Woolie 2019.

[0:38:44] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> the only heavy cago you port is sam huge nuts
[0:38:46] <Aussie_Manny> Are there BT bolas later? Made from back hair?
[0:38:50] <Djinnazz> @WoolieVersus And now this area is clear for like an hour and a half.
[0:39:10] <%jinking79> they take your shit
[0:39:43] <Aussie_Manny> So... running them over WON'T kill them??

[0:42:25] <zafooru> when's bigby's grasping hand
[0:42:46] <+oldmanbirdie> This might not have been the best time to start watching someone play Death Stranding.
[0:43:00] <NotHereToStream> hold in hand, walk near carrier and release
[0:43:01] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[0:45:35] <Tucker0603> DRIFTING
[0:45:55] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> a lot of the upgrades and additions you get in this game are literal gamechangers its kinda amazing
[0:46:11] <Tucker0603> WE TRUCKING BOYS!
[0:46:13] <+bread_assassin> I think truck have a capacity of like 2kgs or something.

[0:48:29] <chronoxgp> amazon drones
[0:48:30] <%Irridium> I hit two deer in the span of 2 days. dumb animals. Both times waited for me to get just close enough I couldn't do anything about it. Fuckers.
[0:48:33] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @RAAAAAINMAKER is it for Mountain Knot to south knot?
[0:48:37] <Rosswelle> dont get too cocky, now. ive been SNIPED by one of those guys throwing their spears TWICE
[0:48:48] <+Razputin217> LITTER
[0:48:54] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> South to Lake City
[0:49:08] <sammybrom> so, what type of game is this?
[0:49:15] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> its a walking sim
[0:49:24] <chronoxgp> kekekek
[0:49:26] <Rosswelle> i would say more of a fedex sim
[0:49:28] <zafooru> its a travel optimization game with action elements and strand type gameplay
[0:49:29] <Dementedpenguin> I was walking by a stream once and saw someone's lost cargo drift by me. Somone took a tumble. LUL
[0:49:29] <Mothman742> its a scp fed ex guy sim
[0:49:47] <sammybrom> oooh, gotcha. Cheers guys
[0:49:56] <chronoxgp> dinosaurs anything
[0:49:59] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> despite trucking and gaining a gun for battle, dont be fooled, its a walking sim
[0:50:22] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Sometimes you just find Rrucks on top of mountains and you ask, how tf did you get this here?
[0:50:22] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:50:25] <Rosswelle> like as you go along, your main objective is figuring out the fastest or most efficient transport routes
[0:50:29] <+Razputin217> S T I C K Y
[0:50:37] <+onlypuppet> Which chapter are we on again?
[0:50:42] <NotHereToStream> 3
[0:50:48] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> if you really wanted to meme call it delivery sim
[0:50:55] <zafooru> Bludens
[0:50:57] <Rosswelle> i mean.....
[0:50:59] <Mothman742> how close are they to the next chapter/ new story shit?
[0:51:04] <Rosswelle> you say :meme" but honestly....
[0:51:05] <+onlypuppet> Ah, right, handle with care
[0:51:34] <NotHereToStream> i mean they have the mission lined up for the next chapter, its up to woolie to do it
[0:51:36] <sammybrom> so from what I'm getting, It's a game where you play as a postman with SOMETIMES guns?
[0:51:40] <zombie_goasts> This game has me interested in hiking.
[0:51:42] <jeagon10> hey how is everyones day going
[0:51:42] <Rosswelle> i believe theyre right before chapter 4, from what i remember offhand
[0:51:49] <Paydrow> I already accidentally caused a void out to happen after a mini boss ate me doodYelp
[0:51:54] <%LowEnergyStarman> LowEnergyStarman subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months, currently on a 13 month streak! 
[0:52:02] <chronoxgp> Thanks for the HahaHide @lowenergystarman
[0:52:03] <Mothman742> aight thx chat :D
[0:52:05] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> theyre on chapter 3
[0:52:25] <chronoxgp> Is this on-site procurement?
[0:52:28] <zombie_goasts> Can you voidout most of the map away?
[0:52:29] <Rosswelle> yeah, should be nearing the end of chap 3
[0:52:39] <Rosswelle> it can be, chrono
[0:52:53] <Rosswelle> just look for random equipment lost by other players, or steal it from mules
[0:52:53] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> pretty sure voiding out means game over
[0:53:13] <chronoxgp> America
[0:53:24] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> no you only get voidout gam oves if your specifically carrying bombs
[0:53:27] <PHANTOM_FOXHOUND> Woolie Verus Futuristic Mailman simulator
[0:53:32] <PHANTOM_FOXHOUND> Aka Death stranding
[0:53:32] <NotHereToStream> void out from mini boss is fine, main mission boss voidout is a fuck
[0:53:52] <Rosswelle> i find the minibosses easy as hell tbh
[0:53:52] <sammybrom> so is there pvp? or is it all pve
[0:53:54] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> because dying by normal means means you get to travel the seam
[0:54:03] <Mothman742> this game made realize that if u slap evil tentacles on other animals in weird places they become eldritch abominations
[0:54:05] <Rosswelle> but i stockpile grenades like nobody's business
[0:54:09] <zombie_goasts> Can you cause enough miniboss voidouts to effect most of the open world map?
[0:54:15] <lotharrio> Red is faster
[0:54:21] <%Ecchigun> yellow submarine
[0:54:23] <+onlypuppet> Oh really OWL2019thumbsup
[0:54:25] <%Ecchigun> yellow submarinee
[0:54:29] <Paydrow> Void outs are interesting I‚Äôm just worried the crater will be permanent
[0:54:39] <zombie_goasts> Mothman742, just add spider legs. Just as effective.
[0:54:41] <NotHereToStream> void outs are scripted to a specific location so you can't willing choose a spot to voidout
[0:54:44] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> yeah I voided out the forrest by the windfarm, was nice not to go through that afterwards
[0:54:50] <%Ecchigun> ew the green
[0:54:54] <%Ecchigun> put it black
[0:55:08] <zafooru> ! m u t e d !
[0:55:08] <Rosswelle> do you guys find voiding out specific places beneficial?
[0:55:10] <%Ecchigun> every time
[0:55:20] <+ThatOneGameTester> rip
[0:55:20] <%Ecchigun> rip woolie
[0:55:23] <+Anonymasque> Mic stranding
[0:55:24] <%Ecchigun> and reggie
[0:55:32] <+invisi_bliss> sound foibles
[0:55:35] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> i havent voided out tbh
[0:55:39] <Mothman742> @zombie_goasts junji ito did that with fish....... it was horrible
[0:55:41] <Rosswelle> im not sure how it works, ive avoided voidouts for a full week
[0:55:43] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> ive died but not by void out
[0:55:45] <+Razputin217> apatHoldon
[0:55:56] <NotHereToStream> voiding out is just a reminder that you fucked up but it mean you can't build structure near/on the crater
[0:55:59] <Rosswelle> ive died by falling into a ravine and off a mountain 3 times......never a voidout
[0:56:20] <Rosswelle> oh so it actually does hinder you a bit
[0:56:24] <SomersaultJustice> it's wolly time
[0:56:25] <+Anonymasque> Man this is just reminding me I need to run some audio updates on my own setup...now I'm bummed.
[0:56:27] <zombie_goasts> I have some concepts where I add more spider legs to normal spiders. Just do that.
[0:56:34] <zombie_goasts> or branching legs
[0:56:36] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Looked it up: If you trigger a void out (eaten by the monster or by Homo Demons), the map will create a crater. All building and infrastructure will be gone. But the crater will only exist in your world. As time goes by, the rain fall will recover the crater and you will see others players building and infrastructure again.
[0:57:05] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> idk how accurate that is tho
[0:57:09] <Rosswelle> wait, so....... timefall works...... backwards on craters
[0:57:09] <Mothman742> @zombie_goasts ur terrible... i live it LUL
[0:57:16] <Mothman742> love*

[1:05:26] <Cherokia666> So, like Pat, Woolie never learned how to deal with the nuke
[1:05:35] <ElkRiverDog> The plates have joined and separated multiple times. Gondwana and Pangea are separate ‚Äúunified‚Äù continent
[1:05:35] <marvel877> Isn't he supposed to carry that by hand?

[1:12:38] <+locutus_of_the_porg> woolie is lucky people actually build roads in his game
[1:12:39] <Dao_Puppy> If you put it on the ground will other players get two nukes?

[1:23:29] <+MurlinDurl> SwiftRage JD A BOMB!
[1:23:33] <NotHereToStream> subtlety is for cowards
[1:23:33] <Mendin> Higgs is many things but subtle.... not so much
[1:23:34] <OldManDeckardCain> SUBTLETY IS FOR COWARDS
[1:23:35] <@Solidus_113> Rich Evans
[1:23:40] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> subtlety is for COWARDS
[1:23:44] <Skatedeandre> SUBTLETY IS FOR COWARDS
[1:23:47] <Dementedpenguin> A nuke? In s Kojima game?!
[1:23:49] <riyokuno> the conversation is stupid if you think about it ... you already know what's inside
[1:23:51] <Aydarkzero> is that a NUKE
[1:23:52] <Solidnick18> TAR PITS
[1:23:53] <+MurlinDurl> did you know? nukes are bad Kappa

[1:24:18] <Mendin> Now is truly the time to appreciate that FULLY ARMED AND OPERATIONAL highway
[1:24:20] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Time to get back in the truck
[1:24:20] <pi_in_the_sci> he did
[1:24:24] <@Solidus_113> NukesBadman
[1:24:25] <marvel877> I hope Woolie drops it running to the tar pits.
[1:24:29] <%OkamiDude15> BLOWS UP?! octoNa octoNi
[1:24:32] <Aydarkzero> spell it out for me Kojima!
[1:24:33] <Nano_osecond> I just went straight to the tar pit- cause I've played his other games XD
[1:24:39] <+heyitsdenzel_> next to the pizza, the nuke is the most important package
[1:24:44] <Graxe_> Just walk it
[1:24:44] <Paydrow> Never seen that cutscene before and I beat it
[1:24:44] <fruit_pie_the_magician> You're lucky he didn't have you ride the bomb from a plane to south knot
[1:24:44] <lotharrio> Japan's anti-nuke bias is getting a little heavy. What did nukes ever do to him, those he loves, or in the past to anyone ever?
[1:24:46] <Graxe_> You got time
[1:24:48] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> you have 20 minutes
[1:24:49] <Solidnick18> doesn't matter
[1:24:51] <Malikwest11> no no no
[1:24:56] <Aydarkzero> Woolie why do you have so much stuff on you!?
[1:24:57] <TigerClaws12> NotLikeThis
[1:25:02] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> we trukin!
[1:25:05] <+MurlinDurl> or you could deliver the nuke Kappa
[1:25:10] <SheefEatsBeef> don't panic :)
[1:25:14] <psudonym> I actually did this in two trips
[1:25:15] <+ultimafullmetal> 20 minutes is plenty of time with the roads
[1:25:16] <CrazyMedicine> time to panic
[1:25:18] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> you.... have.... 20 ninutes
[1:25:19] <+PenmanLupine> he could just private locker the extra stuff
[1:25:21] <Skatedeandre> You still got a delivery afterwards
[1:25:22] <+PenmanLupine> then take the bike
[1:25:24] <Skatedeandre> If you don‚Äôt die
[1:25:26] <@Solidus_113> The bridge will take you right there
[1:25:29] <Dementedpenguin> ???

[1:25:30] <RunningNGunning> oh no
[1:25:30] <+CJett92> EVERYBODY STOP PANICKING
[1:25:33] <psudonym> I did the bomb first by just rushing super duper fast

[1:25:50] <RunningNGunning> he*
[1:26:01] <SheefEatsBeef> pretty sure it can be anywhere in the pit

[1:26:40] <zafooru> Time Trial Begin
[1:26:49] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Now THIS is NUKE TRUCKIN
[1:26:54] <+PenmanLupine> pretty sure he commited suicide Reggie
[1:27:00] <mobius_won> Nuclear Truckin
[1:27:00] <+MurlinDurl> he gave an interview after he landed
[1:27:01] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> he big cum
[1:27:01] <+onlypuppet> Oh yeah
[1:27:01] <pi_in_the_sci> two different guys, more like six guys
[1:27:03] <laguerrilha> what chapter are they at?
[1:27:05] <SheefEatsBeef> it was for america
[1:27:06] <+MurlinDurl> he carried out his orders
[1:27:12] <worldbrand> im sure there's a documentary about this
[1:27:14] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> I am become Death, Destroyer of Worlds quote
[1:27:20] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> he was following orders
[1:27:24] <Skatedeandre> That‚Äôs the ultimate ‚ÄúI just followed my orders‚Äù
[1:27:36] <SheefEatsBeef> 'just following orders sir'
[1:27:38] <Aydarkzero> where did these roads come from?
[1:27:48] <Skatedeandre> We made these roads
[1:27:49] <its_not_arco> He followed orders and saved lives.
[1:27:50] <pi_in_the_sci> I am become death was the guy testing it in New Mexico
[1:27:51] <zafooru> whatt're you gonna do, NOT follower orders?
[1:27:54] <+MurlinDurl> @RAAAAAINMAKER that quote was from the creator of the atom bomb oppenheimer
[1:27:55] <+tuchpi> tfw couldn't get China after
[1:28:02] <+ultimafullmetal> How lawful evil of him
[1:28:04] <NotHereToStream> follow orders or get court martialed
[1:28:05] <+PenmanLupine> I was following orders only works when your on the winning side
[1:28:06] <KingGoblodyte> YES IT IS
[1:28:10] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Yeah this is the Interstate Woolie Express
[1:28:13] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> ohhh yeah thats true
[1:28:16] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> When you are on the losing side, its not an excuse.
[1:28:18] <psudonym> Yeah, this mission is SIGNIFICANTLY harder without these Roads. But Woolie earlier spent the time, grinding out the road materials
[1:28:21] <+spades3> honestly when you think about it you're just fucked either way
[1:28:24] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> A ot of people were responsible
[1:28:25] <laguerrilha> isnt there new laws that allow you to deny orders to commit atrocities?
[1:28:26] <+locutus_of_the_porg> if he didn't someone else would
[1:28:33] <+PenmanLupine> would it have been treason if a soldier refused a superiors orders? Yes, yes it would be.
[1:28:34] <hookhis> how do you even grind in this game?
[1:28:37] <psudonym> thiink of having the roads in this game, are like leveling up dozens and dozens of levels before the main quest
[1:28:41] <Skatedeandre> Yeah someone else would have done it
[1:28:51] <psudonym> you grind out materials like EXP
[1:28:56] <+thegreenbenis> What about laws that let you deny orders so you can commit attrocities?
[1:28:59] <TigerClaws12> but then comes the debate about how many more would have died had he not carried out the orders
[1:29:00] <+thegreenbenis> atrocities
[1:29:01] <Solidnick18> yeah you good
[1:29:07] <+tuchpi> woolie thought people still had muskets so whatever LUL
[1:29:10] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Pearl Harbour required a EX Reversal
[1:29:18] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @hookhis you only grind mats, and usually the prep stations and mule stations are full of them
[1:29:20] <Solidnick18> alright
[1:29:21] <Paydrow> It was a scary time back then n it‚Äôs still scary now

[2:29:08] <psudonym> Nice of Mads and the Fancy Lads to hold back a bit
[2:29:10] <+MurlinDurl> idk why they call it a mobile
[2:29:14] <SheefEatsBeef> baby management during a boss fight is a new mechanic brought by the strand genre
[2:29:15] <lotharrio> Looks like calcium's back on the menu, boys!
[2:29:20] <Skatedeandre> wait are these technically skeleton warriors?
[2:29:23] <psudonym> but they probably didn't like running into that corridor with the shotgun
[2:29:32] <+MurlinDurl> the first strand type game Kappa
[2:29:33] <bigboy3d> Woolie lives on the edge... knot
[2:29:35] <Mendin> Skeleton -SOLDIERS- are different than Skeleton Warriors, watch your Attack on Titan
[2:29:35] <alrobot2014> @SheefEatsBeef yoshi's island would like to have a word Kappa
[2:29:37] <lotharrio> No, warriors don't get paid. These are skeleton soldiers.
[2:29:49] <SheefEatsBeef> oh FUCK you're right @alrobot2014

[2:32:25] <InugamiTheHound> are they using muskets in ww1??
[2:32:27] <psudonym> Woolie's taking the game at a fairly luxurious pace. Considering he completed the highway before connecting South Knot, that's some major grinding
[2:32:44] <Solidnick18> behind
[2:32:46] <+MurlinDurl> musket tech was its most advanced stage by WW1 Kappa
[2:32:47] <@Solidus_113> it's not that major, considering he only plays on stream once a week

[3:01:24] <%attackofthezackchannel> Um Die-Hardman can you take off the mask? It sounds muffled over the hologram!
[3:01:25] <mobius_won> Game broken
[3:01:26] <%jinking79> SPEED LINE
[3:01:30] <Djinnazz> Roads?? We don't NEED Roads.
[3:01:31] <+TheCrispyBoi> ZIP-LINE MAN
[3:01:33] <jorniev> VICTORY ACHIEVED
[3:01:42] <%sjay449> ZIPLINEMAN
[3:01:45] <bigboy3d> Line Zip-Man
[3:01:46] <Skatedeandre> So good I had to stop myself from making zip lines
[3:01:47] <Dementedpenguin> Literal game-changing component.
[3:01:51] <+MurlinDurl> ZIP LINE! ROLL CREDITS
[3:01:56] <jorniev> congrats on beating the game
[3:01:56] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> ROAD KING
[3:01:58] <fruit_pie_the_magician> So, you like GRAPPLING HOOKS do you?
[3:02:04] <+Jimboq> woolie the road builder
[3:02:05] <Guardiansaiyan> rebuild MORE
[3:02:07] <Graxe_> Yes, but zip lines
[3:02:10] <%attackofthezackchannel> His brother is A good day to Die-Hard......man
[3:02:10] <zenith0111> Roads actually can block amazing zipline paths LUL
[3:02:10] <lotharrio> Woolie, how many coasts you connect?
[3:02:14] <@Solidus_113> look for goalposts
[3:02:18] <NotHereToStream> look for a glowing blue fork
[3:02:22] <worldbrand> all the lights in the sky are ziplines
[3:02:23] <Guardiansaiyan> will Woolie be able to find Pat's roads?
[3:02:25] <DensityD> upright fork
[3:02:29] <InugamiTheHound> so besides New York and California and Texas, what other states in America has @WoolieVersus visited???
[3:02:29] <%mayorrev> fuck did I miss the mama scene
[3:02:30] <CazadorDeWulf> I'm not sure how I feel about invalidating some core gameplay mechanics at this point with the ziplines
[3:02:36] <Guardiansaiyan> @mayorrev yup
[3:02:43] <%mayorrev> dagnabbit
[3:02:44] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> THAT
[3:02:46] <Solidnick18> see that
[3:02:53] <Solidnick18> that's a zipline
[3:02:53] <+MurlinDurl> look for feild goal lookin things
[3:02:54] <CazadorDeWulf> Kick a field goal
[3:02:55] <dukenux> Pat's Grand Transamerican Zipline
[3:02:56] <DensityD> look, kojima put them in the game, so are they REALLY invalidating anything?
[3:02:56] <%supersugoisenpai1> There's another to the right
[3:02:57] <Solidnick18> yep
[3:03:02] <%attackofthezackchannel> Just don't connect the roads back to New Jersey
[3:03:10] <@Solidus_113> there's one directly right of you
[3:03:12] <+MurlinDurl> ziplines. this is the way
[3:03:16] <dukenux> why was my message sent twice
[3:03:19] <SheefEatsBeef> it looks like a y-wing
[3:03:21] <NotHereToStream> you can build one right away without materials
[3:03:21] <+Freelance7> Especially since you have to hook up your Qpid to actually get them to show up in areas you go to?
[3:03:35] <zenith0111> Ziplines take up a fair amount of bandwidth so space it out as much as you can
[3:03:38] <jorniev> zip line
[3:03:38] <dukenux> duh, im stumbo, nvm
[3:03:50] <+crimsonharvest> ahoy nerdlings
[3:03:52] <DensityD> Woolie just really wants to be Ryu beating up a car in the bonus stage
[3:03:55] <Skatedeandre> Level 1 zip lines have a range of 300m
[3:03:57] <Djinnazz> @WoolieVersus Lvl1: 300m lvl2: 350m
[3:04:00] <jorniev> make a zip line?
[3:04:04] <+MurlinDurl> each zipline gets like 300m so max space em
[3:04:08] <worldbrand> they really only 'invalidate' backtracking, for the most part
[3:04:11] <zenith0111> 350 radius 700 diameter
[3:04:12] <dukenux> This looks like a terran made for truck
[3:04:15] <Solidnick18> test it
[3:04:15] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1210124488463077376
[3:04:23] <mobius_won> Tfw setting up ziplines across the mountains and every 300metres
[3:04:40] <%attackofthezackchannel> I wonder what kind of back brace he uses. You think he uses the Shaq thing that vibrates on your back?
[3:04:49] <InugamiTheHound> @mobius_won how many miles in 300 meters??
[3:04:53] <@Solidus_113> use
[3:05:02] <Solidnick18> x
[3:05:06] <CazadorDeWulf> @attackofthezackchannel You mean the icyhot? That doesn't vibrate
[3:05:06] <NotHereToStream> using your cuff
[3:05:07] <Djinnazz> @mobius_won 300m? boy you better upgrade those thing!

[3:05:32] <Graxe_> Who needs roads
[3:05:33] <Solidnick18> but you gotta place more
[3:05:35] <zenith0111> BUILD MORE
[3:05:37] <dukenux> ROADS? Where we go we don't need no roads..
[3:05:40] <lotharrio> Now spend three days setting up a zip network
[3:05:41] <%Lion_kun> ZIPLINES FOR LIFE
[3:05:42] <%OkamiDude15> @WoolieVersus BECOME ZIP LINESMAN
[3:05:44] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> calebJ7 calebJ8 calebJ9
[3:05:45] <Solidnick18> ROADS WHO
[3:05:47] <%supersugoisenpai1> Only downside is you can only take what fits on your back

[3:06:00] <worldbrand> ziplines are the sony psp
[3:06:01] <mobius_won> Chiral lines
[3:06:03] <+Jimboq> ziplines powered by chiral fart gas
[3:06:04] <NotHereToStream> only pcc 2 remember
[3:06:12] <mobius_won> Transfarring
[3:06:13] <DensityD> This makes me feel like my dick is 300 meters.
[3:06:15] <%attackofthezackchannel> Now if we can get that cool torch system going from Return of The King going.....
[3:06:16] <Skatedeandre> Yeah 300 meters
[3:06:16] <CazadorDeWulf> Chat's like, "Min max it woolie!"
[3:06:16] <DensityD> it feels good
[3:06:29] <@Solidus_113> Zip Linesman
[3:06:30] <Dementedpenguin> It's a pain to maintain them if you have a lot. I had to do a ton of maintenance work in the mountains. LUL
[3:06:35] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> after this session youll see Woolie create the ZIP network
[3:06:43] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> next session Woolie will be ZIP King
[3:06:44] <GrantsUncle> so how far in is Woolie at this point?
[3:06:45] <%jinking79> gift to moutains delevery
[3:06:46] <Djinnazz> if you're close enought to the ground you can.
[3:06:46] <+MurlinDurl> jump off for science
[3:06:47] <lotharrio> Play part of game, spend hours to no longer play the game again.
[3:06:47] <zenith0111> Upgrading them adds a total of 100m in diameter
[3:06:47] <+tuchpi> off-screen zipline grinding PogChamp
[3:06:53] <dukenux> The Zipping System
[3:06:56] <%attackofthezackchannel> Tip Packages-Overman
[3:06:58] <Mendin> You'll also want to 4-5 star everyone else to get more bandwidth
[3:07:00] <zenith0111> I recommend upgrading as many as you can
[3:07:10] <CazadorDeWulf> Reggie walks in tomorrow to Woolie just going in a whole circuit endlessly
[3:07:10] <chronoxgp> with how much effort he spent building roads, he'll think ziplines are primary
[3:07:13] <%attackofthezackchannel> Looks through your packages man
[3:07:15] <worldbrand> the ZIPPING SYSTEM
[3:07:20] <NotHereToStream> 500 bandwidth per zipline
[3:07:20] <+MurlinDurl> where were going we dont need roads Kappa just ziplines Seemsgood
[3:07:22] <zenith0111> LUL
[3:07:23] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> ROADS ARE OBSOLETE
[3:07:26] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> ZIP IS FUTURE

[3:07:32] <%OkamiDude15> now go! let the zipline legend come back to life
[3:07:34] <+Freelance7> Roads definitely not obsolete
[3:07:41] <%supersugoisenpai1> Where we're going, we don't need roads
[3:07:46] <@Solidus_113> Just watch your chiral network usage @WoolieVersus Ziplines can use up a lot of space fast
[3:07:46] <DensityD> can you make Sam shout anything while riding ziplines?
[3:07:47] <transporterthesequel> Woolie: Roads are cool! Also Woolie: FUCK ROADS ZIPLINES FOR EVER
[3:07:47] <CazadorDeWulf> I need one of these to get to work
[3:07:55] <%attackofthezackchannel> Use the fulton.... oh wait...
[3:07:56] <+onlypuppet> Don‚Äôt those eat up a lot of network?
[3:07:58] <Skatedeandre> Nah there some deliveries that have you hauling a assload of shit
[3:08:07] <%supersugoisenpai1> Time to learn how to build them.
[3:08:15] <Skatedeandre> Imagine if real life had ziplines like that
[3:08:22] <+MurlinDurl> back to truckin
[3:08:22] <zenith0111> @freelance7 I 5 starred this whole game offline without roads. I beat really fast because I didn't waste time building them LUL
[3:08:27] <@Solidus_113> You might have a new pizza mission
[3:08:28] <chronoxgp> Roads canceled
[3:08:30] <dukenux> @DensityD he sometimes go "yeah" or "woohoo", but idk if you can make him say that
[3:08:32] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> the good part is that theyre easy builds and not like bridges or safe houses where you still need resources
[3:08:39] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> just drop a zip and move on

[3:39:23] <+MurlinDurl> they maybe MAYBE had a few pin fire rifles which were what came right after muskets
[3:39:30] <lotharrio> There was an Englishman who fought in WW1 with a long bow and claymore though. He did super well and was a bit of a hero.

[3:40:11] <lotharrio> Napoleon was still doing it... and it's less about humble and more about how inaccurate the rifles were.

[4:42:21] <+linSP> the hottest stars are blue
[4:42:39] <DensityD> some small stars are blue, right?
[4:42:40] <NiktenKing> Blue flames burn hotter... but dependent on the element being burned.
[4:42:45] <DensityD> and other blue stars are super massive?
[4:42:58] <zenith0111> Blue is also the color of your beautiful eyes chat üòç
[4:42:59] <NotHereToStream> kojima picked up a science book and said "this will do"

[4:45:07] <DensityD> I think little spooky grim reaper kirby is canon, but that was a gag costume
[4:45:11] <Superbro64> reminder that xxMeteorxx is a super solid source for kirby lore
[4:45:22] <Superbro64> that dude goes into the MIIVERSE interviews

[4:47:21] <%OkamiDude15> icelandic necropants evo19MindBlown
[4:47:22] <Superbro64> @worldbrand he went into an existential kirby lore crisis when one miiverse q&a answer implied that the lore descriptions in the various Arenas may not actually be canon at all
[4:47:24] <DensityD> everyone who has ever drink H2O has died
[4:47:39] <NotHereToStream> aka solid snake speech at the end of mgs2
[4:48:31] <Angry_Ev1L> placebo doesn't work on belief also
[4:48:33] <NiktenKing> Yes... Woolie... science was held back by the Ipse dixit rule

[4:49:19] <NiktenKing> It means "Because he said so"
[4:49:28] <NiktenKing> People held things to be facts
[4:49:29] <Mendin> Holy god Woolie
[4:49:32] <Mendin> is still going?
[4:49:34] <Mendin> !uptime
[4:49:35] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 49 minutes
[4:49:39] <NiktenKing> and science was held back because nobody wanted to believe anything else
[4:49:44] <zamzoph> Fragile's dad is really big on branding
[4:50:12] <Superbro64> @niktenking for example, you COULD say that science is held back because we believe light to be the speed limit of the universe?
[4:50:27] <Superbro64> or does this not include scientific laws?
[4:50:32] <NiktenKing> The reason why the Renaissance worked is because people returned to the studies of the ancient classics
[4:50:32] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:50:39] <NiktenKing> and actually did shit with it

[4:51:08] <@Solidus_113> GENIUS KOJUMBO
[4:51:16] <%Lion_kun> She's Fragile but not that fragile is up there with worst lines of dialogue of the year.
[4:51:16] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> I know writers who use subtext, Woolie
[4:51:29] <NiktenKing> The reason why we don't challenge anything with light is because we don't currently have a means to comprehend it... not the choice of actively not believing so
[4:51:54] <zenith0111> God could you imagine if Kojima did use subtext NotLikeThis
[4:51:56] <NotHereToStream> fragile has lost its meaning because of this game
[4:51:59] <Mendin> Kojima? Heavy-Handed?
[4:52:03] <DensityD> hey guys, F R A G I L E
[4:52:05] <SheefEatsBeef> opposite of subtlety
[4:52:08] <NiktenKing> Ancient peoples had really complex math and science.... but people were like, nah. Lets not use that.
[4:52:12] <+linSP> i bet kojima felt like a smarty pants writing this
[4:52:15] <chaos2frozen> subtext is for cowards
[4:52:15] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Kojima tried being heavy handed but subtle with MGS2
[4:52:17] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> and look what happened
[4:52:25] <Superbro64> @niktenking those tachyon particles exist someplace out there Kappa
[4:52:28] <NotHereToStream> kojima fucking hates subtlety LUL
[4:52:30] <Mendin> They pronounce it at least 3-4 different ways too. Frajill, Frajile, Frajeel
[4:52:47] <zenith0111> If he used any subtext no one would understand this game at all NotLikeThis
[4:52:50] <DensityD> Like a leg lamp from A Christmas Story
[4:52:55] <@Solidus_113> fra gee le
[4:53:10] <DensityD> Don't take a gun Woolie, You'll Shoot Your Eye Out
[4:53:11] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> if he used any subtext hed still be pretentious but everyone would be upset because nothing was spelled out for them
[4:53:21] <zamzoph> OH BOY
[4:53:24] <Mendin> The Elder's stuff is actually
[4:53:26] <Superbro64> I'm going to assume they are using various accents and pronunciations to make the narrative of this game feel more international @mendin
[4:53:29] <%tiredofthelights> what's the point of channel points?
[4:53:33] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[4:53:38] <%OkamiDude15> sfhKEK
[4:53:42] <DensityD> surly old mistreated elder
[4:53:59] <NiktenKing> The concept of Ipse dixit is basically summed up to be like "ONE GUY" in stream
[4:53:59] <fruit_pie_the_magician> If you like pepperoni and bullets, you've come to the right place
[4:54:03] <DensityD> they elected him
[4:54:26] <zenith0111> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli I've been seeing people calling him pretentious but it's a pretty straight forward message he's giving that's pretty simple in it's core premise
[4:54:30] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL
[4:54:32] <@Solidus_113> hold that visa
[4:55:07] <%tiredofthelights> What's the boomer equivalent in Death Stranding?
[4:55:22] <DensityD> I'm using channel points because I like supporting the streams I find entertaining. and I love attention and memes
[4:55:24] <zenith0111> Like the games message and themes are not that complex like at all
[4:55:25] <Mendin> Bridget/Die-Hardman 2060
[4:55:28] <zamzoph> Boomer Elder
[4:55:29] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @zenith0111 i mean he is pretty heavy handed to the point where he bludgeons you with themes. But again, MGS2 happened, where it was shat on for years and now people praise it because it "predicted the future and its sooooo deep"
[4:55:39] <Superbro64> well, at the very least, we can leave the science to the scientists
[4:55:39] <+Damie904> Oh no
[4:55:43] <BurdRightsActivist> FUNNY VALENTINE PogChamp

[4:56:08] <cheesedburgers> Death stranding for 2020
[4:56:11] <zenith0111> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli MGS2 was my first MGS and sold me one the series. So I don't understand what other people were coming from during that time.
[4:56:12] <Mendin> We survived the Day of Lavos, we'll survive the Death Stranding
[4:56:12] <CursedNobleman> BOOTSTRAPS

[4:58:26] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> oh here we go
[4:58:28] <cheesedburgers> Here we have the part where kojima looked up sexualities on Wikipedia
[4:58:31] <+locutus_of_the_porg> @superbro64 bluepilled charlsJolly
[4:58:32] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> this is the triggered mail
[4:58:32] <DensityD> or building his own new rails
[4:58:33] <Mendin> Kojima is a modern-day Cassandra
[4:58:39] <@Solidus_113> HAVE SEX JAPAN
[4:58:41] <CursedNobleman> hideo kojima has been watching too much zero two
[4:58:44] <+linSP> just have sex
[4:58:46] <+linSP> cmon
[4:58:53] <zenith0111> He's just saying people are afraid to bang because people are scared
[4:58:58] <zamzoph> NO DATA HUH?
[4:59:00] <DensityD> just have a race war
[4:59:02] <DensityD> cmon
[4:59:02] <zenith0111> Scared of making more ghosts
[4:59:05] <NotHereToStream> would you go out into a bt, terrorist, timefall filled world to fuck someone on the other side of the country?
[4:59:08] <Aussie_Manny> winsDerp Sex =/= purity tho
[4:59:11] <+onlypuppet> What was that about homo demons
[4:59:11] <NiktenKing> It kinda makes sense. The proliferation of life causes the rate at which the problem spread even more dangerous
[4:59:15] <Superbro64> so this is a subjective essay we're readin here?
[4:59:20] <+rdark_ksu> MAKE BABIES DAMNIT
[4:59:23] <BurdRightsActivist> EVERYBODY IS LEON KENNEDY
[4:59:31] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> ILL BE HONEST WITH YOU SHINZO ABE
[4:59:32] <+linSP> pat made the same connection
[4:59:39] <%Irridium> SHINZO ABE?!
[4:59:41] <zamzoph> It just means people aren't having sex
[4:59:45] <zenith0111> ^
[4:59:49] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I mean...near hopeless scenario...
[4:59:52] <Aussie_Manny> WE FUCKED
[4:59:56] <NotHereToStream> people don't fuck because death stranding, shit fucks
[4:59:59] <+rdark_ksu> back in my day ppl fucked!
[5:00:00] <NiktenKing> LIFE IS BOMBS
[5:00:00] <Zaphire_Saucypants> and everyone's separated
[5:00:02] <Mendin> ok boomer
[5:00:03] <CursedNobleman> death stranding is a potent aphrodisiac
[5:00:13] <zenith0111> It's like giving birth in a zombie apocalypse
[5:00:18] <zenith0111> It's fucked all around
[5:00:24] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> No one wanted to leave the bunker BECAUSE SHITS REAL
[5:00:24] <+onlypuppet> The cost of living is high
[5:00:30] <Mendin> no Sam is literally allergic to human touch
[5:00:39] <+linSP> i mean if you might die by going outside, it's a little hard to make relationships
[5:00:41] <Zaphire_Saucypants> cuz Kojima likes to throw EVERYTHING at the board.
[5:00:44] <worldbrand> sam has an actual phobia though and i think it is mentioned early on that it might be from dooms
[5:00:46] <NotHereToStream> yo my parents ain't home, but you gonna walk through bt and timefall territory to get some
[5:00:49] <Zaphire_Saucypants> the man can't help it
[5:00:50] <BurdRightsActivist> Why even have sex in he first place? LUL
[5:00:51] <@Solidus_113> because nobody's outside anymore, everyone's in their shelters
[5:00:54] <NiktenKing> Yep. If you fuck more... you fuck more people over because bringing more life to cause the problems before you can fix the problem.
[5:00:58] <DensityD> Goofy doesn't cuddle, or make love, just have sex. Goofy Fyucks
[5:00:59] <Aussie_Manny> Woolie has asexual friends.
[5:01:14] <+locutus_of_the_porg> deliver me my wife please
[5:01:15] <Mendin> And t hen Woolie has Reggie to counterbalance it
[5:01:21] <zenith0111> Woolies biggest downfall is usually overthinking LUL
[5:01:30] <zenith0111> This is great LUL
[5:01:32] <LaughingCatt> That seems like the total opposite of what would happen
[5:01:33] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> also no one's probably gonna be happy with you if you get pregnant and put another mouth to feed back when chiral network wasnt a thing
[5:01:34] <NiktenKing> Fear of proliferation of mortality
[5:01:39] <CursedNobleman> mortality kills the boner. this is only contradicted by all other media
[5:01:46] <Mendin> Chiral network still cant send food/organic material
[5:01:50] <@Solidus_113> What about the chiral porn
[5:01:55] <Superbro64> so is this essentially a "sky is blue" pronunciation?
[5:01:58] <DensityD> so much chiral porn
[5:01:59] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @Mendin yes but it made communication easier with other people
[5:02:16] <Aussie_Manny> Riiiiiight. If there were more fuccin', there'd be more babies, more people, and more potential voidouts.
[5:02:21] <NiktenKing> Ok... but what does that make Chie?
[5:02:24] <Mendin> I mean we MET Mama this session
[5:02:24] <zenith0111> WTF LUL Nipon why
[5:02:27] <%FenixSeraph> rape to raise the population
[5:02:33] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> if that baby died would it be a void out that necrosis?
[5:02:34] <DensityD> O_o
[5:02:35] <Superbro64> "world apocalypse = no babies? Huh, how about that my dudes, ISNT THAT WEIRD??"
[5:02:59] <Aussie_Manny> Who sent this? Heartman? Die-hardman?
[5:03:06] <Zaphire_Saucypants> oh no, the MULES are formin rape gangs so they can deliver dem sweet, sweet, pregnancies. All for the BBs.
[5:03:07] <NotHereToStream> staffer
[5:03:15] <zenith0111> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli When they die necrosis starts then turns into a BT then the BT grabs a living human and causes a voidout
[5:03:15] <Aussie_Manny> Smart staffer.
[5:03:23] <Zaphire_Saucypants> It all connects.
[5:03:27] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Also a later prepper is a doctor and he tells you that shits fucked unless you live in the actual big bunker cities
[5:03:44] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> because doctors are scarce in not big city bunkers
[5:04:01] <Mendin> Oh man wait till Woolie gets to Heartman and his library of bullshit
[5:04:05] <%tiredofthelights> He deserves a promotion
[5:04:09] <worldbrand> his name is *squints* hidego kojumber

[5:11:37] <@Solidus_113> Kojima brain at its max tonight
[5:11:37] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:11:37] <Superbro64> look at the bright side, you will slowly turn into max, he has a record of 13-14 hours of a stream @woolieversus
[5:11:39] <DensityD> ziplines soon‚Ñ¢
[5:11:43] <Mendin> Pat spending 4 hours on-stream just building roads and everyone merrily watching along
[5:11:48] <%OkamiDude15> otsukare üëè
[5:11:52] <DensityD> need chemicals and network
[5:11:53] <%tiredofthelights> I don't know what channel points do but I hope this supports the channel somehow woolieYE
[5:11:58] <Superbro64> he then edits for YouTube immediately after streaming
[5:11:58] <fruit_pie_the_magician> On paper, this game shouldn't be fun, but it totally is
[5:12:08] <SheefEatsBeef> ghost milkies
[5:12:10] <%orion_248> All we need to remember is that Reggie would definitely have sex with Fragile.
[5:12:14] <NotHereToStream> yoko taro can too
[5:12:18] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Genius Kojumbo
[5:12:21] <zenith0111> @notheretostream Yeah if someone else was involved in the crash I would be pretty pissed myself
[5:12:22] <+kazekyou> Titty milk
[5:12:25] <@Solidus_113> Yoko Taro is a different kind of crazy
[5:12:26] <DensityD> grandmother that I would bone down
[5:12:27] <Mendin> Yoko Taro is a different distinctive flavor
[5:12:31] <mankeytennis> and Helen Mirran
[5:12:47] <HungryHungryEmu> did they get to chapter 4 with madds?
[5:12:54] <Mendin> They're mid-5 now
[5:13:03] <HungryHungryEmu> sweet
[5:13:12] <@Solidus_113> I only got in from MGS3
[5:13:34] <zenith0111> MGS2 was a weird point to start LUL buy I loved it
[5:13:35] <NotHereToStream> you can tell its a kojima character
[5:13:38] <Mendin> My GOD I want that man to finally get to make a horror game
[5:14:07] <SheefEatsBeef> don't forget this game was sony giving kojima free creative reign on whatever the fuck he wanted to do
[5:14:08] <Mendin> PT/Silent Hills tease with Kojima, Del Toro, and artwork by JUNJI ITO is just unfair that it never will exist
[5:14:11] <katocrimson> die hardman is basically miller
[5:14:33] <zenith0111> @katocrimson Miller Lite LUL
[5:14:50] <Mendin> Kojima's Celebrity Buddy Hangout is the best ride
[5:14:52] <NotHereToStream> kojima reads alot of books and watches a lot of movie, so he probably picks up a lot of idea from those media
[5:14:57] <%tiredofthelights> @Mendin Junji Ito was involved with PT? what the fuck
[5:15:05] <+GoCoSpace> !uptime

[0:05:43] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THE BOIS IN DAYS
[0:05:48] <ihateyouo> HALO 4 Is a Good Game
[0:05:49] <TGIAbeybaby> Quick question cause I’m new round these parts. Why is there Fem Woolie designs
[0:05:50] <+jiggy_snipe> V doesn't hate Halo 4, he said it wasn't memorable but he enjoyed it
[0:05:53] <$rodreeg91> Cheer500 - Hey Woolie and V, glad to see you're back to sacrificing orphans for more time on the clock (literally). You can still save Reach if you just believe. Just wanted to ask, Bungie in their approach to this game, wanted to make the Covenant a real threat again, after spending 4 games more or less jobbing. Do you think with what you've played so far, they succeeded? Little V, your thoughts as well.
[0:06:00] <+Someone_Kooky> It’s fine, seriously, good story but ehhh levels
[0:06:01] <%augusm> Halo 4 is a 7/10.
[0:06:17] <+Someone_Kooky> Which is better than quite a few games
[0:06:21] <Bespokecloud9> Halo 4 has a cool story but bad level design
[0:06:22] <%brachydios777> I am way more hyped for Infinite with recent news
[0:06:28] <%augusm> Not Halo good though

[0:07:27] <Yummy_Nukes> here's my halo 4 hot take: Cortana's design in 4 is the best design and only rivaled by CE's design
[0:07:33] <%Solidnick18> more readings of the holy cole protocal
[0:07:35] <DemonicHoward> also mark 7
[0:07:39] <+Someone_Kooky> @augusm Having just played through the trilogy for the first time, I’d call it varying quality
[0:07:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> DELTARUNE CH2 NEVER T_T
[0:07:42] <dinnydanny777> Cortana looks good in 4

[0:10:16] <twoah> In Halo infinite cortana will be revealed to be John Halo’s vtuber avatar the whole time
[0:10:18] <IAMEVILORD> So we're all in agreement. Halo 5 sucks
[0:10:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yes
[0:10:28] <%brachydios777> People who say 4 is shit haven’t played enough shitty games
[0:10:31] <KingVantq> the only bad thing about 5 is the story
[0:10:34] <%Josef_Stryker> Watch Woolie loves it tho based on gameplay
[0:10:42] <Deadmanslegacy> always wondered if 5s story was worth playing.
[0:10:44] <%brachydios777> We are all in agreement with 5
[0:10:44] <%BallerSwagBro9k> 4 was fine. MP was meh tho without Forge
[0:10:52] <%augusm> @someone_kooky Fair play, for me the contrast was so stark that its the only Halo game I played through once and then never touched again. I think I played maybe two or three games of the multiplayer before giving the disc to a mate
[0:10:53] <ihateyouo> the armor is 5 is also awful
[0:10:55] <%Solidnick18> oh no

[0:38:12] <DigitalJoshie> Jackals are: "fuck you pay me"
[0:38:14] <%LiquidDinosaur> @LoganPayne Captain Keys fucking smokes his pipe on spaceship. He's like "im the captain rank has privileges" but uh, thats not a "youre not important enough to smoke" rule thats a "if you smoke you will blow up all the air on the ship you moron" rule
[0:38:14] <letshavecakes> Without the covenant, the Jackals are basically just space pirates by nature
[0:38:14] <%brave_sj> They are the first race we meet in the space around Harvest though
[0:38:17] <Tallie> the protocole

[0:39:40] <%brave_sj> ODST is supposed to come to PC in October
[0:39:40] <%Irridium> I mix and match apart from Nintendo games which I always buy physical because jesus why would you buy nintendo games digital you know how they are
[0:39:47] <%ringabal> Nothing is true
[0:39:49] <alrobot2014> i bought DMC4SE on xbox and anytime xbox live went down i couldn't play the damned game
[0:39:54] <+GruntOfAction> Marvel Heroes the diablo like game was one such thing that just straight up vanished cuz Disney didn't like the CEO getting into shady stuff.
[0:39:56] <+QueequegTheater> Kill them all, Woolie
[0:40:01] <%flarebears> its comeing to pc soon @IndoorSitup
[0:40:01] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Put away your WiiU games
[0:40:03] <%GeneralSCPatton> Platinum Games' Legend of Korra. Existed for like a year, with no discs.
[0:40:12] <StebTheVee> Buying physical is eventually gonna be you having a mini museum.
[0:40:16] <%brachydios777> ODST PC is next month
[0:40:22] <%SirGO0SE> i only pick digital if its a game i know ill play until end of console cycle
[0:40:31] <+Feralspirit41> I had finished the first season of the sopranos before it was taken off of amazon prime by HBO
[0:40:35] <IndoorSitup> I have a PS4 with PT still installed.
[0:40:42] <%LiquidDinosaur> my mom still uses Netflix CD because there ARE some things too obscure to find on reputable, streaming services and i dont trust her computer skills to use sketchy sites like Putlocker.
[0:40:47] <andre11dr> Oh boy, here we go again
[0:40:47] <rsg220> the comfy pleasure of knowing there is a copy of jedi knight: jedi outcast somewhere in your mom's house
[0:40:48] <%DatAsuna> The end of the start?
[0:40:49] <%DappercatEsquire> DappercatEsquire subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! (insert lore)
[0:41:05] <%LiquidDinosaur> and she needs her obscure quirky tragedies. She has dry eyes so she watches sad movies to cry and moisten her eyes
[0:41:07] <+p4ntless> I feel that, I just started getting into vinyl because why not become that asshole, and while it's nice to own my favorite albums making room for bigass physical media is a bitch
[0:41:09] <%GeneralSCPatton> Space is just the ultimate ocean
[0:41:17] <%LiquidDinosaur> which seems like a kind of cynical reason to wach tragedy movies but eh, if it works
[0:41:24] <letshavecakes> Where does the air force go in a sci-fi universe
[0:41:26] <%yeeter_baelish> very fascist
[0:41:27] <Depthcharge2030> so what your saying is we need a space ship with guns on it?
[0:41:27] <%brachydios777> Pretty much
[0:41:30] <%JohnAtDawn> Oh gee wonder why
[0:41:30] <%DianaTheAscian> shocker
[0:41:34] <Mr_Strut> But that's the BEST outcome
[0:41:39] <%derap41> Very Starship Troopers
[0:41:41] <%afronooch> hmmmmmm
[0:41:42] <+Williamld> Yeah, they're a military dictatorship
[0:41:45] <+Troispoint> Yeah but humanity is on the brink of extinction, fascism is a natural response in those circumstances.
[0:41:45] <LeBlanc233> are you saying the UNSC aren't the good guys?
[0:41:45] <IndoorSitup> ONI are a bunch of crooked fucks.
[0:41:47] <StebTheVee> ONI was a dead giveaway
[0:41:51] <dreadedcthulhu> yum yum fascism
[0:41:51] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Apparently the Space Force is actually under the U.S. Air Force, not the Navy
[0:41:51] <%LiquidDinosaur> the UNSC is literally a fascist shithole that were kidnapping children and making them into monsters before an existential threat to humanity made that justifiable
[0:41:53] <%DatAsuna> The UNSC are very lucky that aliens turned up to distract everyone
[0:41:54] <ArbyW> Fuck Dr. Halsey
[0:42:03] <%JetpackMcQuack> Wartime measures are pretty useful
[0:42:04] <rsg220> fascism to defeat the aliens
[0:42:04] <%Chatterbox1991> Aristocracy
[0:42:04] <+ntfth> They are one now, before the Covenant they were a democracy.
[0:42:06] <dinnydanny777> Aristocracy because nobility is somehow more likely to care
[0:42:10] <%yeeter_baelish> sristocracy
[0:42:10] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Wayland Yutani vs the Reich
[0:42:11] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> How the fuck did earth just agreed with going directorship?
[0:42:15] <%brave_sj> Canada is immune to invasion. Any invading army would encounter a moose behind every tree.
[0:42:15] <Yummy_Nukes> yeah but the rebels nuke cities and gun down school children
[0:42:16] <%BisoromiBear> return to monke
[0:42:18] <%DatAsuna> Aristocracy is easier to centralize blame
[0:42:19] <dinnydanny777> Aristocracy because you might get a semi decent Lord
[0:42:26] <%PirateDad_> Revive the Holy Roman Empire
[0:42:31] <ArbyW> @PrettyThickandStrongDyck Nobody can disagree if you kill everyone who does
[0:42:32] <%JetpackMcQuack> Ask New Mombosa
[0:42:34] <%derap41> Fascism vs Neo Feudalism
[0:42:38] <%derap41> Wage slave is a real term
[0:42:40] <%wunp_fxs> yep
[0:42:41] <Sullry> wagecucks
[0:42:43] <alrobot2014> shadowrun is free on epic right now by the way
[0:42:43] <%ringabal> "If you're not born rich, you might as well be dead."
[0:42:44] <rsg220> uh that's not a cyberpunk term
[0:42:44] <%brachydios777> Didn’t we fight communists on Mars?
[0:42:45] <+shockedb2> a mook
[0:42:47] <%DatAsuna> "wagecuck"
[0:42:47] <dreadedcthulhu> wagey wagey get back in your cagey
[0:42:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wagey cagey
[0:42:52] <IndoorSitup> The Office of Naval Intelligence are a sign of how garbage the UNSC really is.
[0:42:54] <Jmann9218> Get in the Wage Cage
[0:42:56] <+p4ntless> wagie wagie sit in cagie
[0:42:57] <+punit216> Aristocracy is usually more incompetent and easier to overthrow
[0:42:59] <%JohnAtDawn> Shadowrun definitely didn't invent that term.
[0:43:00] <+QueequegTheater> David Wage
[0:43:01] <%BigBlackBankai> I think the innies deserved more spotlight in the games
[0:43:04] <LeBlanc233> i think they used to have a civilian goverment but it got disbanded at the start of the war
[0:43:04] <%derap41> If you work to make a living and can't accrue value you are a wage slave
[0:43:05] <%brave_sj> I hate nobles, but they at least have some concept of honor and duty
[0:43:08] <Safarihat> autocracy vs democracy
[0:43:09] <%LiquidDinosaur> @QueequegTheater i was literally talking about that with a buddy of mine in the air force this morning. Apparently a former Navy SEAL congressman is trying to push some bills to make the Space Force use navy ranks. And i support that because then it implies we can get Space Marines (who i get are not TECHNICALLY NAvy but are like, half so)
[0:43:11] <%DianaTheAscian> the illusion doesn't work if u know it is one

[0:43:36] <dreadedcthulhu> sentient life was a mistake
[0:43:40] <%Chatterbox1991> you can get a benevolant dictator in a monarchy, you cant really in a corperation
[0:43:40] <IndoorSitup> DEMONS ARE COOL GUYS
[0:43:43] <rsg220> listen, if keyes showed up to the UN with a Crucible, i'd be down

[0:43:58] <andre11dr> "Just let the demon eat you"
[0:44:06] <%LiquidDinosaur> @QueequegTheater THAT BEING SAID, the basic enlisted ranks for Air Force are Airman, Airman First Class and Senior Airman
[0:44:07] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:44:16] <%Chatterbox1991> Otto von Habsburg

[0:44:25] <IndoorSitup> Woolie wants to fight Palpatine.
[0:44:27] <%LiquidDinosaur> @QueequegTheater and that implicitly mean that if they use Air Force ranks they'd be Spaceman, Spaceman First Class, and Senior Spaceman
[0:44:27] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus "Brave New World" vs. "1984"
[0:44:30] <%JetpackMcQuack> Now who gets to sit in the chair? 4Head
[0:44:30] <%derap41> Woolie Feudal monarchies have lasted longer than all other social systems
[0:44:36] <rytisone> like blow me away on legendary
[0:44:37] <Admiral_PopnFresh> but the monarchy usually does a good job of embedding loyalty into national identity and fighting culture wars against uprisings
[0:44:37] <%BisoromiBear> sub and click the bell

[0:45:08] <%Solidnick18> yeah
[0:45:20] <IAMEVILORD> Another chapter in the LittleV vs the Halo Book fans.
[0:45:25] <IndoorSitup> No longer are you getting "wort wort wort" either.
[0:45:26] <%brachydios777> Elites are real ass threats in Reach
[0:45:28] <%DatAsuna> And they're optimised for tragedy
[0:45:31] <Explodincatz> untranslated
[0:45:31] <%DianaTheAscian> its cool
[0:45:33] <%cobalt_phoenix_> they do a good job of giving you a bit of hope then crushing it
[0:45:35] <%derap41> Feels like they're just wiping you of their shoes
[0:45:36] <%ringabal> Wort the Wort
[0:45:41] <+Feralspirit41> The lack of wort worts in this game is disappointing
[0:45:41] <+p4ntless> WE GOT SOME GOOD HITS IN THO
[0:45:43] <Admiral_PopnFresh> the hopelessness is big in Reach, I appreciate it
[0:45:43] <%ChoculaUltra> we're totally winning shut up tho
[0:45:46] <%Gelphaze> Thanks Little V your Hazbin Hotel - ADDICT music is the best, money well spent.
[0:45:51] <IndoorSitup> Elites are at their absolute deadliest in Halo: Reach.
[0:46:03] <SomeDudeDrawing> I was just literally listening to Little V on Spotify while I'm drawing And now he's on stream LUL
[0:46:05] <andre11dr> Yeah they are wrecking you in this game, which you never saw before because John is a fucking superhero
[0:46:06] <+kewlmyc> LUL
[0:46:11] <%BigBlackBankai> Just a Predator at that point
[0:46:11] <+Stupid121v2> makes sense to me
[0:46:14] <%brachydios777> Not wrong
[0:46:15] <ralphfromdk> That's a very good way to get "kat'ed"
[0:46:17] <%LiquidDinosaur> @QueequegTheater we literally are all proles in 1984. They're passively spied on but not 100% 24/7, and are controlled via booze, sports, free porn, pop music made entirely by procedural generation, and occasional bombing attacks by "the enemy" which may or may not be false flags but it doesnt even matter
[0:46:18] <%derap41> Could have a sealed facemask
[0:46:19] <%ChoculaUltra> Reach was literally the "0-2 but it was really close tho" energy
[0:46:19] <prime_name> Jorge is the fucking strong
[0:46:20] <IndoorSitup> Elites are fucking assholes on Legendary in Halo: Reach.
[0:46:21] <%brave_sj> Iunno probably
[0:46:21] <Admiral_PopnFresh> cause its mostly a amask
[0:46:26] <%DatAsuna> Unless you're that jen hale spartan who never wears a helmet for some reason
[0:46:28] <Snakes_dk> Nagoriyuki does it will with helmet and dreads
[0:46:29] <letshavecakes> That sounds like a dumb system to have without any redundant backups
[0:46:36] <%jaygee303> Soloman had dreads and hes fucking dead
[0:46:53] <%LiquidDinosaur> @jaygee303 you know who else had dreadlocks? Darth Nihilus
[0:46:53] <%wunp_fxs> yeaaahhh, 6 month break for contracters
[0:47:00] <%derap41> @LiquidDinosaur You're mixing in a little brave new world there too
[0:47:06] <IndoorSitup> That type of thing is common in AAA development, unfortunately.
[0:47:06] <%wunp_fxs> At least thats the implcation i got when i applied to them
[0:47:08] <%JetpackMcQuack> oof
[0:47:18] <+QueequegTheater> @LiquidDinosaur Not really. Surface similarities. 1984 proles are held in check entirely through fear of The Party, the control-through-pleasure in Brave New World is much closer to modern society.
[0:47:20] <ralphfromdk> 18 on, 6 off
[0:47:22] <%LiquidDinosaur> @derap41 i read both but only listed things specifically in 1984
[0:47:28] <Mr_Strut> So like accountants?
[0:47:30] <%Irridium> get them contractors going
[0:47:37] <IndoorSitup> That's common in AAA game dev these days.
[0:47:40] <%SirGO0SE> we need fucking unions
[0:47:48] <IAMEVILORD> Developers need unions
[0:47:53] <+QueequegTheater> Sangheili accountants, you say
[0:47:54] <%Irridium> didn't microsoft also make noise about having a AAAA studio? that's gonna be fucking fun
[0:47:55] <DeadStage> They've needed unions for years now
[0:47:58] <%BinaryFireball> yea but the content is now worse overall imo
[0:48:02] <Snakes_dk> im not a fan of super corporatitaion of gaing, but its how buisniess goes
[0:48:05] <%LiquidDinosaur> @QueequegTheater ok its both, like especially the pills and consumerism, but i always am amazed at how precscient he was about freely universally accesible porn and pop music "made by machine"
[0:48:09] <%MacabreOpus> Developers developers developers develeopers
[0:48:10] <%BigBlackBankai> Likr Makashima says like the worlds of Phillip K Dick
[0:48:22] <%Chatterbox1991> you are going to hit the ceiling
[0:48:27] <+TreeeFOX> rocksteady
[0:48:33] <%JetpackMcQuack> Let's play 'Push Your Luck'
[0:48:33] <+QueequegTheater> @LiquidDinosaur Look, if fixing it means I lose my SFM folder, I'm not sure it's worth it
[0:48:38] <dinnydanny777> Nowadays people hate unions Woolie
[0:48:39] <%ringabal> I look forward to a post-Cyberpunk 2077 industry
[0:48:42] <%derap41> We are late stage capitalism so revolution is comming
[0:48:50] <dinnydanny777> The press has convinced the general public that unions and protests are bad
[0:48:52] <+blewbeary> and aks you stop that shit shit b
[0:48:56] <%derap41> Singularity Wooh!
[0:48:57] <+blewbeary> breaks*
[0:48:58] <LeBlanc233> the neo-Revolution is coming
[0:48:58] <Make_me_mad> As someone in the heart of Texas, I feel like we're heading straight for civil war 2 no matter how this election goes.
[0:48:59] <%JohnAtDawn> Video games came into prominence right after Reagon, that's why they've never had unions.
[0:49:00] <%JetpackMcQuack> We have twitter now
[0:49:01] <%afronooch> We kinda forget why we need Unions
[0:49:02] <IndoorSitup> @derap41 Revolution?
[0:49:13] <%yeeter_baelish> unions need to come back
[0:49:15] <+Lunaar> Cheer1000 imo ODST and Reach are some of the best spin-off games out there, whether you prefer the classic trilogy or not! If either of you had the keys to be Project Lead on a new Halo video game, what would you like to explore in this universe and would it feature the Chief? Love the plays, love you both.
[0:49:28] <Safarihat> nah we are just gonna hit the crash point again
[0:49:31] <Sullry> balkanization in 50 years
[0:49:34] <+QueequegTheater> There's no actual revolution coming, because most people are significantly more comfortable in their daily lives than they were fifty or 100 years ago
[0:49:34] <dinnydanny777> In the UK there was a newspaper calling Teachers and their union cowards in capital letters for being scared of returning to schools
[0:49:36] <IndoorSitup> @leblanc233 Revolution?
[0:49:45] <%LiquidDinosaur> @QueequegTheater @derap41 also let me just put it out there that while i Like the book for its like, commentary, George Orwell is a fucking creep and when you read it you get the distinct impression that he has never spoken to a woman in his life who wasnt his mom or a prostitute
[0:49:48] <Snakes_dk> unions will be sooner or later
[0:49:48] <dinnydanny777> And people agreed with those papers because jingoism
[0:49:49] <%MacabreOpus> One of the only unions that sucks is a police union. Media love to spin hate towards public transport unions. The creative industry desperately needs more unions
[0:49:53] <DeadStage> The issue right now for devs is there's so many young people getting into it that don't understand how crushing it is right now, so unions can't form because the younger devs don't know why they need them.
[0:49:57] <%afronooch> Unions are still around, but they're seen as "ugh less money for me" instead of "Yeah, workers have rights"
[0:50:06] <rytisone> they'll come up with new schemes
[0:50:06] <%yeeter_baelish> imagine a streamer union

[0:50:11] <Mr_Strut> It would be nice
[0:50:11] <%BigBlackBankai> Apparently the US during Nam was more divided so I don't see Civil War 2 Electric Boogalo happening
[0:50:11] <andre11dr> Unless they decide to just do what animation studios do ,and export yhe work overseas to basically Asian slaves
[0:50:12] <%Solidnick18> alright
[0:50:12] <Make_me_mad> I don't think there'll be a revolution. It'll be the people already happy with the way things are stepping in to firmly establish the boots on the throats of the people who are comfortable.

[0:52:20] <Make_me_mad> Either way soon the governments of the world are going to have to deal with the fact that there are more civilians than they really need. Not more than the planet can handle, obviously, but more than they actually literally need. I expect them to literally cull the population before they try Universal Basic Income.

[1:21:28] <+Haildrops> @LoganPayne People are annoyed because having permasprint changes how you design maps because you can cover ground faster, so map designs aren't like they used to be

[1:21:35] <%DSD24> Oh did Woolie get some more gear for his Spartan?
[1:21:41] <+D00msDayDan> *gets in turret, which can't drive* yeah it's completely stuck
[1:21:45] <PrideOfFiddles> "Completely stuck" sitation needed
[1:21:45] <%DomunDomunDomun> Backwards scorpion was a valid tactic in CE multiplayer, as the driver's seat in multiplayer was covered by a cage you could be sniped through.

[1:22:04] <Fareflight_> @LoganPayne I don't want to start the debate but enhanced mobility kinda ruins Halos sandbox, especially vehicles. Look at Halo 5. Maps are huge, weapons are hitscan and vehicles don't matter.

[1:42:11] <dinnydanny777> Sacrifice Reach for the Jetpack
[1:42:12] <%The_Swedish_X> @demonichoward I know it is legendary. That’s why I said “learn about” in that V tells him about it.
[1:42:13] <%Solidnick18> i love jetpacks
[1:42:15] <DarkestDawn64> Did Woolie ever get evade? Or is it even in the campaign?
[1:42:16] <%Solidnick18> i read it
[1:42:17] <Ynkubus_> Do whatever you have to do. read as, you can hijack a banshee if you want
[1:42:19] <+Haildrops> it's not a slog on legendary if you hijack a banshee immediately and just stay out of range
[1:42:20] <%subjectg> steal a wraith, it makes this and the LASO run way easier
[1:42:28] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> woolieYE

[1:43:05] <+Feralspirit41> The government has been experimenting in making jetpacks for decades and some jerk at LAX was able to fly one
[1:43:26] <dinnydanny777> There's that thing where you can make a jetpack out of pressurized water or something
[1:43:28] <PrideOfFiddles> Amma management at risk
[1:43:31] <%Bigyanno> A isn't as important as B,C and D
[1:43:34] <%The_Swedish_X> Woolie giggling is the best.

[1:53:03] <+Standard_Enemy> Fuck you havoc engine lol
[1:53:03] <%subjectg> @ballerswagbro9k it’s not a peripheral issue if you lack fundamentals babe
[1:53:14] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @subjectg HahaThink
[1:53:15] <+Haildrops> even for halo M/K is much easier, makes the precision weapons so much deadlier
[1:53:15] <+QueequegTheater> Also this ^
[1:53:17] <%DianaTheAscian> ive noticed woolie has gotten used to reloading hes learning
[1:53:19] <IndoorSitup> Crouch, Woolie!

[1:53:30] <%DSD24> That was harsh
[1:53:32] <LoganPayne> Yeah that would suck
[1:53:33] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah there is no version of "good play" that involves jumping in the line of fire of 20 enemies
[1:53:36] <IndoorSitup> Crouch to take cover!
[1:53:38] <%huskarl_zap> The autoaim gives controllers the advantage
[1:53:59] <%doomerskeletor13> waynerWhite
[1:53:59] <+Haildrops> only for close engagements
[1:54:02] <theaceclaw> controller auto aim in the pc version was some bs
[1:54:09] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @Louie_Salmon Unless youre a Berseker who get's stronger the more he takes damage
[1:54:09] <%huskarl_zap> The codex astartes warns against blindly.jumping into enemy fire
[1:54:11] <iamtheTwitchghost> TANGOS
[1:54:13] <IndoorSitup> Stay frosty.
[1:54:14] <%Bigyanno> I mean yeah M/K is better but back in the day I could snipe moving targets across the map with the splazer with a controller. The autoaim is crazy strong on controller
[1:54:21] <%DSD24> Viper was the sickest shit

[1:57:51] <Fang_of_Yeenoghu> The Ghost stayed behind to perform the torch and burn. That's why the cavern was caving in as Noble team arrived, the Ghost was destroying the base above.
[1:57:52] <bearwagon> rip Woolie thinks Cortana is forerunner made or found? hopefully not

[2:02:25] <DarkestDawn64> They brought her there to get the forerunner info
[2:02:25] <%huskarl_zap> Cortana was made through reversed engineered by halesy
[2:02:26] <Bossingtonhuggermugger> She was just there processing data
[2:02:26] <IndoorSitup> Cortana was made by Cortana
[2:02:26] <invalidarg56> she is Halsey my dude

[2:02:30] <+IntrepidEye> Cortana was always made from a clone of Halseys brain
[2:02:31] <%Bigyanno> Cortana was just in charge of the excavation

[2:02:38] <DarkestDawn64> Vhas got to be trolling man
[2:02:38] <%derap41> The answer is "what do you think?"
[2:02:39] <%brave_sj> She's compiling and storing data from the ship
[2:02:40] <karl_rex> Cortana is able to split herself into copies
[2:02:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Cortana is half Halsey half Forerunner construct
[2:02:40] <stayinthepocket> Fuck off V
[2:02:41] <Lordkeyblade> no you won't

[2:02:46] <%Irridium> oh the sub messeges are gonna be great LUL
[2:02:46] <IndoorSitup> This Cortana fragment is scanming the Forerunner tech.

[2:03:40] <IndoorSitup> That's not a spoiler, V. Jeez.
[2:03:40] <Iccirrus> The collector's edition journal goes over it a bit. Yes,it's confusing
[2:03:40] <Louie_Salmon> Well, nevermind then
[2:03:41] <mamobelty> But you get a sick trophy thou
[2:03:41] <Mechazoic_Era> GOT ONE

[2:03:46] <%condemned_15> Balls exposed
[2:03:49] <%JohnAtDawn> There's no lore you don't know, this game was just made with the writer's head up his own ass.
[2:03:51] <%doomerskeletor13> V became the woolieONEGUY
[2:03:52] <%Penguin93> Come on guys just let V be wrong and silently deal with his passive aggression
[2:03:54] <JarCup> "HOORAYYYY!"
[2:03:55] <AppleBerryKitty> i hate they removed the arch on mcc
[2:03:56] <Daxte_> does halo 4 go into how cortana was made?
[2:03:57] <gladsomepraetorian> It's quite obvious. She's its custodian, but she wasn't built by the Forerunners.
[2:03:57] <%ogobmt0619> perfece 360 noscope
[2:03:57] <%Bigyanno> Your confusion is simply down to a badly worded statement from Halsey. It's not as complicated as she made it sound
[2:04:00] <DotDusk> It is fine, nobody saw it
[2:04:03] <Nomad94> @JohnAtDawn As if, you're just too lazy to read
[2:04:04] <mamobelty> Plus the added bonus of bragging rights
[2:04:07] <FiendishlyInventive> V's never been so WRONG.
[2:04:07] <heartlesshealer> stop talking about Cortana
[2:04:08] <gladsomepraetorian> Literally no one else was confused about this V.
[2:04:09] <DemonicHoward> @Daxte_ not in the slightest
[2:04:12] <SoaringLettuce> I left for a couple minutes, did anyone die?
[2:04:12] <%RadicalWeegee> VEE PPLLZ , XPLAIN LOORE PLZzz
[2:04:15] <%doomerskeletor13> Halsey loves being enigmatic and it confused you
[2:04:15] <letshavecakes> Not one single part of this is confusing or contradictory, or even complicated
[2:04:16] <gladsomepraetorian> This isn't a spoiler.
[2:04:21] <+Kotyc_> Cortana is literally just helping Halsey analyze data LUL
[2:04:21] <abelincoln_catpuncher> no one talk about Cortana lol
[2:04:23] <FiendishlyInventive> NOT A SPOILER
[2:04:24] <+taggerung403> V has the craziest talk
[2:04:27] <gladsomepraetorian> Woolie's just misinterpreted one line.

[2:04:39] <LoganPayne> Not a spoiler, not even remotely complicated
[2:04:40] <+QueequegTheater> Cortana was actually built when a fireax came flying out of Silent Hill
[2:04:40] <$Sfaux97> God damn V is almost as bad as Pat
[2:04:42] <abelincoln_catpuncher> reach pistol is wonderful!
[2:04:46] <%Bigyanno> V's NO SPOILERS rule is really backfiring here
[2:04:48] <Depthcharge2030> Reach Pistol is great
[2:04:49] <%The_Swedish_X> Glad i skip the donation segments, because this is going to be fuuuun
[2:04:50] <%DomunDomunDomun> @SoaringLettuce Jun left, Carter is flying around in a pelican while badly wounded
[2:04:52] <%huskarl_zap> Vat
[2:04:53] <abelincoln_catpuncher> much higher fire rate than DMR
[2:04:55] <%doomerskeletor13> Pistol rocks in this game
[2:04:57] <andre11dr> Chat, you're getting baited hard, stop
[2:04:58] <Depthcharge2030> but ODST pistol fucks
[2:05:00] <gladsomepraetorian> Nothing about this is a spoiler because it's information that you can easily infer.

[2:07:27] <zashrin777> I believe the point of V's crypticness is to get chat to just chill/wait/ and see.

[2:08:34] <FiendishlyInventive> @IndoorSitup Correct, Correct, Correct.
[2:08:35] <%subjectg> They don’t read chat anyway so copypastas are pointless
[2:08:36] <Lunaar> @doomerskeletor13 he does, honestly
[2:08:37] <WackyModder84> @IndoorSitup, YES IT ABSOLUTELY DOES. Reach did not fall in a matter of days. It fells in a matter of HOURS. Plus, the Brutes were NOWHERE TO BE FOUND in the novel of Reach. Bungie literally pulled that outta their ass.
[2:08:38] <IndoorSitup> @doomerskeletor13 Little V doean't have to keep being wrong too.
[2:08:40] <+azzynpc> Basically that fragment of Cortana has the map data that leads them to find Halo in CE
[2:08:40] <DPmusique> I thought Cortana was the old lady
[2:08:42] <%BallerSwagBro9k> https://clips.twitch.tv/HelpfulFunnyMeatloafMingLee
[2:08:44] <+Haildrops> Reach contradicts the books because in the book the Pillar is already in atmosphere, not in dry dock.
[2:08:45] <gladsomepraetorian> What V is being vague about doesn't even require an explanation.
[2:08:46] <%The_Swedish_X> This choke point was rough when I was younger

[2:09:26] <Lunaar> @WackyModder84 Brutes not being in the Fall of Reach book does not disprove them being present on the planet during the fall
[2:09:30] <abelincoln_catpuncher> guys yall are being baited so hard lol
[2:09:34] <cipher758> chat loves text wall spam
[2:09:35] <%doomerskeletor13> It’s not even that big of a retcon
[2:09:41] <Louie_Salmon> What's with the aversion to DMR?
[2:09:42] <Lunaar> besides, games>extended AU every time
[2:09:43] <+deanbees> what difficulty are they playing on btw?

[2:09:48] <%subjectg> heroic
[2:09:51] <Bossingtonhuggermugger> I mean, if chat's being baited, fine, but isn't woolie as well?
[2:09:54] <IndoorSitup> @wackymodder84 @haildrops That is some silly retcons to be upset about lol
[2:09:55] <%BisoromiBear> everything will be okay
[2:09:57] <+azzynpc> also Bungie is the one who made the retcons, none of the books supercede the Canon of the games lol

[2:09:57] <+Kotyc_> deanbees heroic
[2:10:02] <%Bigyanno> This is not a case of V baiting, this is a case of V being wrong and it affecting woolie's experience negatively
[2:10:04] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Cortana was helping Halsey extract info from a Forerunner ship. She herself is not a Forerunnerr construct

[2:10:24] <gladsomepraetorian> What V was being vague about simply isn't even anything that's been retconned. He's just flat out misinterpreting the facts.

[2:11:09] <Lunaar> @gladsomepraetorian to be fair, as someone that read the books and has played Reach many times... Cortana's significance in relation to the forerunner area is not very clear
[2:11:10] <+Haildrops> Brutes were also in Halo Wars which is set very close to the beginning of the war, brutes were retconned to have been present since at least then.

[2:11:28] <gladsomepraetorian> Still, it's never implied that Cortana is a Forerunner AI at all.
[2:11:28] <+cowardman93> it's the best she had
[2:11:29] <zashrin777> *Do it for forklift*
[2:11:32] <+QueequegTheater> She knew they had the power of forklift
[2:11:32] <abelincoln_catpuncher> night vision?
[2:11:33] <gladsomepraetorian> Not even by implication.
[2:11:35] <%Bigyanno> The exact position of the PoA on the planet is such a non issue that it's honestly not worth talking about
[2:11:48] <+cowardman93> Cortanna was just processing the info on the ship

[2:13:47] <Idon__> blaze of fucking glory BibleThump 7
[2:13:48] <letshavecakes> Woolie's nightvision makes this look like a fallout game
[2:13:49] <%DSD24> Spartans don't die they are just lost
[2:13:51] <%huskarl_zap> now it's just the school shooters
[2:13:53] <%The_Swedish_X> Never turn off green
[2:13:54] <dereks0n> I love that they had Emile be the last one with you. They very easily could've had it be the Captain, but they said nah fuck it
[2:13:56] <rsg220> Fun fact: Emile is voiced by the actor who portrayed Marlo Stanfield in the Wire
[2:13:56] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Especially Spartan-IIIs, which are different than Spartan-IIs
[2:13:58] <LoganPayne> Emile is so mad at this point. All his friends are dead
[2:13:58] <Bossingtonhuggermugger> Carter MIA
[2:14:02] <stayinthepocket> I've never seen so much green

[2:14:10] <phatmac16> SPARTANS NEVER DIE
[2:14:10] <heartlesshealer> this is probably bad, but what if the confetti went off in that cutscene?
[2:14:11] <PrideOfFiddles> Green is all Woolie knows
[2:14:12] <therealtacopancakes> carter out is a badass way to go
[2:14:12] <rytisone> quiet in a halo game Kappa

[2:14:21] <Idon__> why are we in night vision again?
[2:14:21] <phatmac16> THEY JUST GO KIA
[2:14:22] <%The_Swedish_X> Kinda fun that you never do a coop mission with just Carter.
[2:14:26] <59hawks> "press x to make the world go green"
[2:14:28] <+taggerung403> Drones suck absolute ass on legendary
[2:14:28] <%Bigyanno> Does Woolie just see everything in a shade of green anyway?
[2:14:30] <mamobelty> I wonder if Emile can be of any help against drones
[2:14:32] <stayinthepocket> @rsg220 Liar I'm looking that up right now
[2:14:32] <rsg220> @Estuko punished mario

[2:14:49] <%huskarl_zap> Hulk vision
[2:14:50] <prime_name> What's wrong with green?
[2:14:50] <phatmac16> WELCOME TO WOOLIE VISION
[2:14:54] <heartlesshealer> woolie just loves green
[2:15:02] <%The_Swedish_X> All green, all the time
[2:15:02] <%doomerskeletor13> Pump up the green to new heights
[2:15:02] <+deanbees> This is the true woolie experience.
[2:15:04] <zashrin777> flying enemies are almost always terrible
[2:15:04] <AceOne5> O Green World
[2:15:08] <+jazzmand27> Oh man we are so close to the best level
[2:15:08] <squidmax1> There's a reason they haven't come back in 4 and 5
[2:15:10] <Torivore> Woolie doesn't know NV is on because his vision is green tinted irl
[2:15:11] <dinnydanny777> The green sure is greener in Halo Reach
[2:15:11] <%The_Swedish_X> Flying always sucks
[2:15:12] <%subjectg> They’re not as bad in Reach
[2:15:16] <phatmac16> POV: You are Woolie
[2:15:17] <Fang_of_Yeenoghu> They are literally flies with guns
[2:15:21] <dereks0n> Nah what are you talkin about, chat? This is clearly just the Emerald Ravine
[2:15:25] <%yeeter_baelish> odst NotLikeThis
[2:15:26] <+A_mere_shrubb> I wish buggs where in firefight
[2:15:26] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:15:26] <rytisone> play Kirby's Green Greens
[2:15:28] <%ringabal> They are living biological jetpacks
[2:15:28] <+Doctor_Stew> flying ass bullet sponges
[2:15:30] <%subjectg> ODST with the shielded drones, however...
[2:15:41] <AceOne5> It ain't easy being green huh guys?
[2:15:44] <+Haildrops> just kill the engi first 4head
[2:15:46] <FazzleRazzle> chat this is what you see when your on teh weed, dont do milk lads, drink you drugs and stay outta school
[2:15:51] <$Sfaux97> At least Reach doesn't have shielded drones
[2:15:51] <bearwagon> CANT AUTO COMBO NOW Woolie
[2:15:52] <%Bigyanno> The only level where the buggers worked imo was the second level of Halo 3 where it was all in confined spaces and you had access to turrets
[2:15:54] <%doomerskeletor13> I legitimately hope Woolie keeps night vision on the rest of the game and just acts like nothing is different
[2:15:57] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Did Woolie like Kirby because the theme is Green Greens, or did he like green because of the theme
[2:15:58] <+jazzmand27> Jesus Woolie use the scope
[2:16:08] <+Xchunkylover73x> TOO MUCH GREEN
[2:16:10] <+D00msDayDan> oh like lightsaber armor from star wars eu?
[2:16:11] <thebalticguy1> Woolie sounds panicked
[2:16:21] <Jashter18> Alright chat who's going out first during "that bit" Woolie or V?
[2:16:23] <heartlesshealer> I thought it was because of Enzo
[2:16:25] <%DSD24> No we need more green
[2:16:25] <Yummy_Nukes> we green boys
[2:16:32] <phatmac16> Woolie is he’s mad rusty
[2:16:37] <AceOne5> ARMOR LOCK
[2:16:38] <%MajoraZ> They do, that's what elite's shielding is :V
[2:16:41] <%The_Swedish_X> I hope V leaves Woolie to flounder.
[2:16:41] <IndoorSitup> @jashter18 SHHHHHHH

[2:19:48] <Chainsaw105> this is my second favorite Invasion map
[2:19:54] <PrideOfFiddles> @stayinthepocket LUL good one
[2:20:01] <AceOne5> has Woolie tries to armor lock burst on a vehicle yet?
[2:20:02] <%Bigyanno> This is my favourite invasion map
[2:20:06] <+YabbaTroll> that shoulda blocked
[2:20:07] <%subjectg> @bigyanno lp tax can’t be this bad, ya know? It’s really baffling
[2:20:10] <pochecito> ooh almost
[2:20:11] <Louie_Salmon> So close to countering that
[2:20:15] <+Haildrops> i mean you've not got many invasion maps to pick from
[2:20:18] <%The_Swedish_X> Emil keeping his distance with his shotgun sure is something.
[2:20:26] <%doomerskeletor13> Yo wtf where did the green go?
[2:20:27] <dinnydanny777> I think the game needs some more green
[2:20:30] <IndoorSitup> LP tax is really taking a toll in Woolie's eyes.
[2:20:32] <%subjectg> I like this map more than spire definitely
[2:20:38] <%huskarl_zap> hits different
[2:21:05] <Fang_of_Yeenoghu> @subjectg Agreed, though I do like what Spire was going for.
[2:21:10] <therealtacopancakes> this map was great in mp back in the day
[2:21:10] <heartlesshealer> Yaaaaaaay
[2:21:11] <AceOne5> the other side of this building is a damn challenge on higher difficulties
[2:21:13] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Game doesn't seem green enough, I think there's an audio issue
[2:21:15] <pochecito> WHAT
[2:21:16] <+QueequegTheater> *video
[2:21:24] <%jaygee303> Remember invasion mode?
[2:21:24] <buster7800> YOU CAN DO THAT!?!?
[2:21:28] <Parapattern> Bring back the G R E E N
[2:21:33] <%The_Swedish_X> Why fight when you can coward?
[2:21:33] <Lunaar> @QueequegTheater lmao stfu
[2:21:33] <%brachydios777> The warthog run is longer than the Autumn’s canonical length
[2:21:34] <%subjectg> This is a popular flanking route in invasion
[2:21:34] <AceOne5> actually he dropped it..
[2:21:37] <+mundanelotus> no full charge tho
[2:21:44] <+Haildrops> cheating elite with the dual wield
[2:21:45] <countnostalgia> There goes the night vison
[2:21:45] <mamobelty> In Invasion, this room was grenade central
[2:21:46] <Chainsaw105> 343 bring back Invasion!
[2:21:48] <abelincoln_catpuncher> oh god finally not green
[2:21:50] <+Ancopro> invasion was dope
[2:21:56] <+taggerung403> bring back swamp thing vision
[2:21:57] <Yummy_Nukes> you can do that but if you do your peepee gets smaller HahaLean
[2:21:58] <%doomerskeletor13> I miss the green
[2:21:59] <%SirGO0SE> sounded like he said shit for me
[2:22:00] <FiendishlyInventive> IT's not a shield recharge Woolie.
[2:22:00] <%yeeter_baelish> man elites are so cool
[2:22:04] <DarkestDawn64> Invasion was basically switched for Warzone
[2:22:05] <Lunaar> nice lock, Woolie
[2:22:07] <phatmac16> InVasion was cool
[2:22:07] <heartlesshealer> PartyHat PartyHat PartyHat
[2:22:08] <+Haildrops> armour lock used successfully poggers
[2:22:09] <atravelbee> I wish I had the money to subscribe, sorry Woolie :(
[2:22:11] <+mundanelotus> I think Woolie still believes the armor lock gives him a health boost
[2:22:13] <AceOne5> sweet lock yea
[2:22:14] <+Alfax> The "Woolie shoot one more time after destroying shields" challenge
[2:22:25] <%The_Swedish_X> Legendary and harder is mostly just learning how to avoid as many battles as you can

[2:23:19] <+Walopoh> SOLVEM PROBBED
[2:23:20] <IndoorSitup> *Cortana fragment
[2:23:21] <$Sfaux97> LASO is something else

[2:23:57] <%atravelbee> @doomerskeletor13 I definitely will woolieYE woolieYE
[2:23:59] <+Chillstice> coof
[2:24:00] <%The_Swedish_X> That door was dark as shit
[2:24:10] <%doomerskeletor13> woolieFABRICATION woolieFABRICATION woolieFABRICATION woolieFABRICATION
[2:24:11] <FiendishlyInventive> GODS AND DEMONS
[2:24:23] <%doomerskeletor13> Fucking AI government
[2:24:23] <AceOne5> these are so much better than terminals SeemsGood
[2:24:29] <dinnydanny777> Wow if only the Covenant knew how much Forerunner shit they demolished when they glassed Reach
[2:24:47] <FiendishlyInventive> You anyone see my messages?
[2:24:48] <%huskarl_zap> stfu speakers
[2:24:49] <AceOne5> Demons, monsters...
[2:24:50] <%DatAsuna> lucky john halo disagrees
[2:24:57] <bearwagon> LUL
[2:24:57] <%doomerskeletor13> No luck huh...
[2:24:57] <GoogleyGareth> LUL
[2:24:57] <%brave_sj> You see Woolie THE AIS ARE IN CONTROL
[2:25:09] <%einherjarvalk> "what would be enough to fuck up-" *WHACK*
[2:25:17] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus MCU Cap would, instead we made comics Cap
[2:25:19] <+cowardman93> authoritarian you might say
[2:25:20] <letshavecakes> I mean, they're just captain america with power armor
[2:25:20] <FiendishlyInventive> I'm in chat jail aren't I?
[2:25:21] <%brachydios777> Resistance would have been fucked
[2:25:22] <%Bigyanno> wait, so the AI's made the spartan 2 program expecting a war once the covenant comes into contact with humanity?
[2:25:22] <+taggerung403> More like Captain America in a War Machine suit
[2:25:23] <AceOne5> for the Collective
[2:25:24] <Torivore> I just realized, Woolie not turning off NV is the same as him not pressing A to get the item pickup box out of the way in Dark Souls
[2:25:26] <%huskarl_zap> and they still suck compared to elites
[2:25:26] <%DSD24> Spacenoids
[2:25:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> IN DOING MY PART
[2:25:29] <RamenRiderZ> For the EMPRAH
[2:25:30] <%DatAsuna> coughkilofivecough
[2:25:32] <Mr_Strut> Frozeners
[2:25:32] <%akman14> The council?
[2:25:33] <%DSD24> Star Trek?
[2:25:36] <%yeeter_baelish> TITANS DID NOTHING WRONG
[2:25:37] <%huskarl_zap> pfft
[2:25:38] <ralphfromdk> Cap with even better drugs, super implants, and god damn power armor. Then take out the thing that makes him nice and human.
[2:25:41] <Yummy_Nukes> yeah but they were fighting rebels who were nuking cities and gunning down school children
[2:25:45] <+ntfth> People dropping nukes on cities of tens of millions kinda results in overkill in return. Who could've guessed. Kappa
[2:25:45] <%DatAsuna> not if you watch DS9
[2:25:48] <PrideOfFiddles> Federation is full of corrupt admirals LUL
[2:25:49] <Fareflight_> Nu trek isn't canon
[2:25:49] <%Bigyanno> The Federation has a problem with corrupt admirals
[2:25:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Federation has A LOT of bad eggs
[2:25:51] <StebTheVee> Authoritarian vs Theocracy
[2:25:54] <+Feralspirit41> *insert section 31*
[2:25:55] <%doomerskeletor13> UNSC sucks ass, the only reason we don’t go into that is because the Covenant are a moral deus ex machina
[2:25:56] <andre11dr> something something SEIG ZION
[2:25:59] <+Haildrops> They rarely make the rebels out to look very good tbh, most of the shit they do is nuking civilian centres and killing millions
[2:26:02] <%BisoromiBear> STP era
[2:26:06] <+taggerung403> Starfleet couldnt be trusted
[2:26:07] <%SirGO0SE> woolieFABRICATION
[2:26:07] <%sssoapy> techno utopia
[2:26:07] <%DomunDomunDomun> Picard Star Trek: "Just let the Romulans die, lol."
[2:26:09] <IndoorSitup> Voyager and DS9 were good too.
[2:26:11] <+taggerung403> The Federation was OK
[2:26:17] <Nomad94> this place is pain on Legendary
[2:26:26] <+JustToWatch> The Federation was a land of contrasts
[2:26:26] <letshavecakes> Tom Clancy's Halo
[2:26:26] <dinnydanny777> I wonder if the Covenant weren't around would the Halo series be about murdering civillians
[2:26:28] <AceOne5> here we go
[2:26:29] <%huskarl_zap> Romulans best society
[2:26:30] <+taggerung403> Except Section 31/ONI
[2:26:35] <StebTheVee> Is there a time where the government in anything AREN'T the bad guys?
[2:26:36] <+taggerung403> Fuck those guys
[2:26:38] <%The_Swedish_X> Has Woolie learned about the BoB’s?
[2:26:40] <AceOne5> nice lock!
[2:26:40] <%God_Of_Oreos> PogChamp
[2:26:48] <+Haildrops> Halo would be about suppressing insurrections if the covenant weren't around
[2:26:49] <FiendishlyInventive> Yeye Wools
[2:26:51] <NiN10doh_ULTRA_64> Good lock
[2:26:58] <dinnydanny777> If the Covenant weren't invading would the game be about crushing the peasant uprisings?
[2:27:00] <%doomerskeletor13> I would love a game where you actually have to fight the UNSC but they’re too cowardly for that
[2:27:07] <+taggerung403> Pog Lock
[2:27:11] <DarkestDawn64> I don't think there's any reason Woolie would know about the BoBs.
[2:27:12] <zashrin777> good lock.
[2:27:13] <%huskarl_zap> PogChamp
[2:27:14] <%yeeter_baelish> good lock
[2:27:16] <letshavecakes> Halo without the covenant is basically Crysis in space
[2:27:16] <stardustcrusad3r> NO SOLD
[2:27:19] <AceOne5> Woolie Popping and Lockin
[2:27:20] <+cowardman93> Halo without the covenant would be CoD Infinite Warfare
[2:27:21] <tecko93> jaja cagon
[2:27:22] <+Haildrops> He did kill the gold ranger on the sniper mission
[2:27:24] <%einherjarvalk> Woolie the coward being an armor lock user checks out
[2:27:26] <%FuqBoiSlim> based lock
[2:27:28] <%einherjarvalk> good at it tho
[2:27:29] <DFireCreations> Halo would be Tom Clancy Elite Squad if the covenant didn't show up
[2:27:30] <+mundanelotus> V bad
[2:27:30] <zashrin777> HA
[2:27:32] <+Ancopro> LUL
[2:27:34] <rytisone> shotgun for flood
[2:27:35] <+QueequegTheater> NIGHT VISION THO
[2:27:35] <+Deko_> NotLikeThis
[2:27:40] <%doomerskeletor13> Of course Woolie would love the parry
[2:27:40] <+Estuko> LU:
[2:27:42] <FiendishlyInventive> USE THE SHOTGUN
[2:27:42] <%doomerskeletor13> V LUL
[2:27:43] <gladsomepraetorian> V's contempt for the chat was never amusing.
[2:27:44] <%brave_sj> it kinda sucks in this game
[2:27:44] <$RyTYoung> LUL
[2:27:44] <+mundanelotus> Green Shotgun
[2:27:44] <%Penguin93> HAHA PASSIVE AGRESSION
[2:27:46] <Bossingtonhuggermugger> shotgun does kinda suck in Reach
[2:27:47] <prime_name> What is this bit?
[2:27:47] <%huskarl_zap> SMOrc SMOrc SMOrc SMOrc SMOrc
[2:27:50] <%The_Swedish_X> You’d probably be a marine if you were dealing with the insurrection.
[2:27:50] <%subjectg> lol good luck with this shit
[2:27:50] <dinnydanny777> I miss shotgun
[2:27:52] <+C1ic> why would we want to watch him try snipe with the shotgun?
[2:27:53] <%Bigyanno> I think maybe he should consider the shotgun here
[2:27:53] <+D00msDayDan> if only they had some sort of gun that fired buckshot
[2:27:55] <Nomad94> V's vendetta against the chat is so unnecessary OpieOP
[2:27:55] <gladsomepraetorian> You know what would be useful for Hunters?
[2:27:56] <+Msytic6> Woolie, DONT use the shotgun!
[2:27:57] <$RyTYoung> NEVER SHOTGUN
[2:27:57] <gladsomepraetorian> THE SHOTGUN
[2:27:58] <%DSD24> I hate the worms
[2:27:58] <AceOne5> BOOM
[2:28:00] <%huskarl_zap> NU BIT NU BIT
[2:28:01] <%sssoapy> cortana dead
[2:28:01] <+QueequegTheater> IF ONLY THERE WAS A WEAPON THAT WAS GOOD AGAINST HUNTERS
[2:28:04] <Prince_Robot> why does he keep trying to zoom in the with assault rifle?
[2:28:06] <slix3431> SMOrc
[2:28:06] <+Ancopro> shotgone
[2:28:06] <+Feralspirit41> Its almost like V knew these hunters were here
[2:28:08] <%The_Swedish_X> V having some bonus fun this section.
[2:28:08] <%RioGascar> maybe if ya had shotgun you wouldnt be dead
[2:28:09] <%yeeter_baelish> NEVER TRUST A KIG YAR
[2:28:13] <AceOne5> run V!
[2:28:13] <Saffry_Ruzin> Youtube Comment Section is going to have fun with this
[2:28:14] <letshavecakes> Those are actually Skirmishers
[2:28:14] <Parapattern> Oh W O R M?
[2:28:16] <slix3431> YAH GITS
[2:28:18] <vincerocmm> jackle revange
[2:28:20] <%doomerskeletor13> NIGHT VISION CAN KILL HUNTERS
[2:28:22] <pochecito> Yeah, the shotgun sucks never use it :)
[2:28:24] <%mitchteck> But the shotgun
[2:28:25] <zashrin777> @QueequegTheater Yes. The plasma pistol. Of course!
[2:28:32] <RamenRiderZ> Space red vines
[2:28:33] <%jepupu> jepupu subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[2:28:34] <%Bigyanno> At first I found V's disdain for the concerns of Woolie's audience amusing but it's honestly getting tiring at this point
[2:28:35] <AceOne5> Now is the time for the Green again
[2:28:39] <dinnydanny777> What if you plug Cortana in now and she's just covered in smoke and ash
[2:28:39] <%einherjarvalk> HE MISSED
[2:28:40] <FiendishlyInventive> V's contempt for the Chat actively making Woolie's experience worse.
[2:28:46] <%FuqBoiSlim> shotgun? more like shitgun Kappa
[2:28:52] <karl_rex> Break the window and jump through
[2:28:54] <+slimmixrp> Woolie still not knowing that they are only vulnerble in the bacl
[2:28:59] <VidulaSaix> Agree it actually has gone beyond bit and kinda of bothersome at this point
[2:29:00] <+mundanelotus> this is gonna be a long one
[2:29:01] <+MagiKestral> i don't mind V trolling, I just feel like he needs to say it outright instead of being sarcastic
[2:29:06] <+Walopoh> contempt for chat for the sake of being punk isn't really punk
[2:29:07] <%doomerskeletor13> It’s ok Woolie, cowards win
[2:29:08] <%brave_sj> Spartan Laser got nerfed hard in reach
[2:29:11] <Joestar1890> Thanks Emile
[2:29:11] <zashrin777> good shit woolz
[2:29:11] <thebalticguy1> SHOOOT THE WORM
[2:29:12] <%The_Swedish_X> Coward ness is what keeps you alive in firefights.
[2:29:12] <DemonicHoward> its not trolling when woolie doesnt know better
[2:29:13] <Bossingtonhuggermugger> This fight is skppable, fyi, just jump through the window
[2:29:19] <LoganPayne> Emile is a good ally
[2:29:20] <AceOne5> Big DMG
[2:29:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it started off pretty funny bc of lore nerds kinda spoiling things but now it's getting old
[2:29:30] <zashrin777> gg
[2:29:33] <%yeeter_baelish> PogChamp
[2:29:34] <Joestar1890> gg
[2:29:37] <+mechslayer71> Imagine being so childishly contrarian that you actually make your life harder and less fun just to spite someone LUL NEVER understood people like that
[2:29:38] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:29:40] <AceOne5> Hunter Xed

[2:29:51] <%brachydios777> LUL
[2:29:54] <%FuqBoiSlim> new bit
[2:29:55] <%RioGascar> unless you are gavin
[2:29:57] <letshavecakes> Hey, you know what weapon would've made that fight easier?
[2:29:59] <StarlitStunner> Future bit
[2:29:59] <zashrin777> next bit
[2:29:59] <%RioGascar> in which case you cry
[2:30:03] <Bossingtonhuggermugger> UNKNOWN BIT
[2:30:04] <%huskarl_zap> No guns from now on
[2:30:05] <+cowardman93> maybe press Y?
[2:30:09] <+taggerung403> Around Jackals watch your backals
[2:30:12] <%huskarl_zap> new nit no guns
[2:30:16] <DemonicHoward> jesus man
[2:30:18] <+Msytic6> Watch out, they're aiming for your controller!
[2:30:20] <%wunp_fxs> woolie....cmon
[2:30:24] <FiendishlyInventive> Omg really
[2:30:26] <Saffry_Ruzin> Guess we should tell them to use all guns so they use no guns
[2:30:28] <DemonicHoward> maybe by halo 8 woolie will learn what gun he is holding
[2:30:29] <Paragon_Sheep> Woolie "tunnel vision" Madden
[2:30:29] <%doomerskeletor13> They gonna snipe your controllers battery again
[2:30:30] <Louie_Salmon> Woolie versus gun management
[2:30:35] <%DomunDomunDomun> Big brain V getting Woolie to not try a weapon type he likes to spite chat.
[2:30:42] <dinnydanny777> Just use the DMR, lol
[2:30:46] <Bossingtonhuggermugger> I mean for real the shotgun is ass
[2:30:47] <IndoorSitup> The LP tax has taken a major toll on Woolie's eyesight.
[2:30:47] <coracor> woolie "binoculars = scope" madden
[2:30:53] <heartlesshealer> PartyHat PartyHat PartyHat
[2:30:53] <%yeeter_baelish> LUL
[2:30:53] <$RyTYoung> DMR all the waaay
[2:30:55] <+YabbaTroll> Emile beat his ass
[2:30:57] <iamtheTwitchghost> dang
[2:31:00] <%doomerskeletor13> Maybe night vision would help Kappa
[2:31:02] <AceOne5> Sworded
[2:31:11] <Saffry_Ruzin> Halo Reach Shotgun is much better than 3's Shotgun
[2:31:11] <LoganPayne> Take. The. Sword!
[2:31:12] <FiendishlyInventive> @DomunDomunDomun Yeah, actively making the experience worse.
[2:31:12] <+Someone_Kooky> V is weirdly spiteful, even compared to pat
[2:31:18] <+taggerung403> I wish the sword wasnt almost worthless on legendary
[2:31:20] <$Sfaux97> Chat is telling you you use gun? Psh, this is a melee only play-though now
[2:31:20] <%doomerskeletor13> Sword woolieSPICE
[2:31:23] <Parapattern> Rolled up and layed you out
[2:31:26] <Artoo_The_Me> Sword bois!
[2:31:30] <dinnydanny777> Maybe Woolie should use the assault rifle
[2:31:32] <heartlesshealer> I love just working on something while this is on and then suddenly hearing the "Yaaaay!"
[2:31:37] <%doomerskeletor13> I would love to watch someone attempt a melee only run
[2:31:40] <%FuqBoiSlim> he's not spiteful he's punk Keepo
[2:31:42] <IndoorSitup> @someone_kooky He's just incredibly insecure.
[2:31:45] <%ringabal> wuz that smell
[2:31:50] <$RyTYoung> @someone_kooky Pat is embodying v right now
[2:31:52] <heartlesshealer> yaaaay
[2:31:53] <%Penguin93> Wrong again
[2:31:55] <%brachydios777> Yeah, mk 4
[2:31:59] <%afronooch> Did y'all forget the whole "Telling us to do something makes us want to do the opposite?"
[2:32:00] <+Ancopro> 'cole protocol' and 'interesting' feels wrong
[2:32:04] <+MagiKestral> to be fair, woolie is gonna use the sword over the shotgun OR the plasma pistol at this point anyway
[2:32:06] <stayinthepocket> @someone_kooky He wants to act as Wollie's bulwark but sometimes comes across as a pompous asshole
[2:32:08] <%The_Swedish_X> I think they figured out shields fighting Elites.
[2:32:08] <%doomerskeletor13> Cole Protocol is one of the lesser books
[2:32:10] <$Sfaux97> @doomerskeletor13 Would that be possible? Besides the ship section
[2:32:13] <gladsomepraetorian> Contrarianism isn't actually funny.
[2:32:14] <SereneFox> Too be fair though, chat isn't entirely innocent in the exchanges either
[2:32:18] <whever_mikey> Fun fact, in Reach you can counter an energy sword strike with a melee!
[2:32:27] <%doomerskeletor13> @sfaux97 I have no idea but I’d love to see someone try
[2:32:28] <+Someone_Kooky> Oh I know, just as an observer sitting here
[2:32:31] <gladsomepraetorian> No, no - it wouldn't have been a problem if he hadn't tried picking fights with chat constantly.
[2:32:35] <Bossingtonhuggermugger> I mean, ya'll try streaming with this chat and not getting a little salty
[2:32:39] <Joestar1890> HEALING IS DISHONOR
[2:32:39] <$RyTYoung> WOOF
[2:32:40] <%huskarl_zap> that's dumb
[2:32:40] <dinnydanny777> How are the Sanghelli alive
[2:32:42] <heartlesshealer> Medicine is dishonorable. Wow
[2:32:42] <%akman14> No honor
[2:32:43] <IndoorSitup> @stayinthepocket That's because he is.
[2:32:45] <%DappercatEsquire> honor is stored in the blood
[2:32:47] <Saffry_Ruzin> The Rrragh is them going Suicidal
[2:32:48] <%krispen_wa> caesar's legion?
[2:32:49] <%ringabal> "Dumbass, you didn't Perfect your run."
[2:32:49] <VidulaSaix> Honor is a meter LUL
[2:32:50] <+QueequegTheater> THIS MEDIC HAS NO HONOR
[2:32:51] <%brachydios777> Yep
[2:32:51] <+taggerung403> Thats worse than Klingons NotLikeThis
[2:32:55] <%DSD24> Truly a bloodbound honor system
[2:32:59] <%dekkitout> Sanghelli's are DPS mains to a fault
[2:33:03] <karl_rex> No wonder they got duped by the prophets
[2:33:04] <%doomerskeletor13> Just heal on your own 4HEAD
[2:33:06] <+taggerung403> Worse than Krogans even
[2:33:07] <zashrin777> The alien plotlines in the books are definately the best bits
[2:33:09] <dinnydanny777> Kind of like some kinds of religious groups too though I guess
[2:33:09] <+Ancopro> replace blood with confetti
[2:33:09] <Joestar1890> Aren't there Halo Covenant Books?
[2:33:10] <%doomerskeletor13> 4Head
[2:33:11] <+MagiKestral> I just feel like if he's going to do the sarcastic bit, make it a little more obvious, because it's hard for me to tell what's a serious advice and what's anti-chat
[2:33:12] <%subjectg> Jackals with plasma rifles! Only in this room!
[2:33:16] <Idon__> Jin Sakai could learn a thing or 2 from the covenant
[2:33:17] <+Haildrops> a sangheili medic under arbiter chews some bitching elites out in Halo 5 and it's one of the decentr parts
[2:33:19] <%DarkestVegemite> Spartan suits have auto medic systems, constant dishonor
[2:33:19] <+QueequegTheater> Sangheili players DC when you make them play Mercy
[2:33:20] <letshavecakes> That explains the shipmaster, and the new guy revealed for Infinite
[2:33:22] <+baronothebest> We are made men by the blood
[2:33:23] <Louie_Salmon> Man the vibe with this music is something
[2:33:26] <Saffry_Ruzin> @joestar1890 There are plenty
[2:33:29] <%DukeBlack_> jesus you guys need to get over this shit. You're acting like this man ruined your whole over a video game

[2:57:18] <dereks0n> REMEMBER REACH
[2:57:19] <+Kotyc_> O D S T
[2:57:20] <gotaragingsofty> Just wait for ODST, the absolute best OST>
[2:57:20] <countnostalgia> Halo Reach ost loves using drums
[2:57:20] <Yummy_Nukes> Kappa
[2:57:20] <+Grynovus> It's good
[2:57:21] <%Solidnick18> hooohooo
[2:57:21] <Joestar1890> But there's also Halo ODST
[2:57:21] <%AceOne5> Lul Woolie
[2:57:24] <$RyTYoung> the best Halo game
[2:57:26] <%subjectg> Wait til ODST baby
[2:57:26] <DigitalJoshie> Reach is my absoulute favorite game
[2:57:26] <%Puhff> Real Reach was friends along the way
[2:57:27] <%brachydios777> It’s so good
[2:57:27] <+Idziman> Reach has bangers
[2:57:28] <Self_esteampunk> oh wait until odst
[2:57:28] <Bossingtonhuggermugger> ODST: Rain
[2:57:28] <%Bigyanno> Woolie has opinions and opinions can't be wrong, but he's wrong here
[2:57:31] <stormhawk9891> ODST has the best, but this one is still fire
[2:57:32] <%BurdRightsActivist> Don't tell woolie about ODST
[2:57:32] <%derap41> ODST is better
[2:57:32] <wubi_desu> but jazz
[2:57:32] <Lunaar> Reach is Bungie's magnum opus. You can't prove me wrong.
[2:57:33] <OldManDeckardCain> saying this is the best OST is quite a REACH Kappa
[2:57:37] <%AceOne5> The last Great Halo game?
[2:57:37] <sw0rdmstr> The fact the Bungie tribute section doesn't show up sucks.
[2:57:38] <%doomerskeletor13> ODST is fire as well
[2:57:38] <andre11dr> Halo 2 is pretty good, this one is on that level, maybe better
[2:57:40] <wombatlime> WOOLIE A MAN OF CLASS
[2:57:41] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:57:42] <$RyTYoung> Still holding 2 overall everything
[2:57:43] <StarlitStunner> Rain
[2:57:44] <+abrupt_abe> This is my favorite Halo
[2:57:44] <+azzynpc> Best 2 OSTs are Reach and ODST
[2:57:46] <%brave_sj> You can't spell ODST without OST
[2:57:47] <theaceclaw> ODST gonna be on pc soon too now that they finished their beta testing PogChamp
[2:57:47] <+Walopoh> V IN SHAMBLES
[2:57:47] <+A0N33> WOOLIE LIKES THE THING I LIKE PogChamp
[2:57:50] <%brachydios777> It’s really good
[2:57:51] <AppleBerryKitty> shotoEww
[2:57:52] <%slimmixrp> It's a Halo War
[2:57:52] <+Grynovus> Understandable
[2:57:52] <wubi_desu> my man
[2:57:53] <Chainsaw105> the piano at the beginning of Lone Wolf gives me chills every time
[2:57:53] <%doomerskeletor13> WOOLIE IS RIGHT
[2:57:54] <%The_Swedish_X> The set pieces were strong, wish I liked the story around them more
[2:57:54] <+CSNG> Composed by Martin O'Donnell & Michael Salvatori
[2:57:54] <+TawnyMonarch> Woot
[2:57:55] <%DSD24> The armor customization
[2:57:57] <%derap41> 2 Reach ODST 1 3
[2:57:58] <wombatlime> CULTURED WOOLIE
[2:57:59] <%slppanther29> doodGood
[2:57:59] <%LordSDB> woolieCHAN woolieCHAN woolieCHAN
[2:57:59] <dinnydanny777> Halo Reach, Everybody Fucking Dies
[2:57:59] <%yeeter_baelish> woolie is gonna like halo 5 LuL
[2:58:00] <%seniormeatbox> HE'S GONNA LOVE ODST
[2:58:02] <dereks0n> This is my favorite Halo, I love it
[2:58:06] <VidulaSaix> I big prefer it
[2:58:06] <%doomerskeletor13> WOOLIE KNOWS WHATS UP
[2:58:07] <IndoorSitup> Reach: A Halo Story
[2:58:07] <%Bigyanno> I think Reach is a better co-op experience than the others
[2:58:08] <%Halospaz117> This was the perfect goodbye Bungie could have done
[2:58:13] <%AceOne5> back to basics with armor abilities was fantastic
[2:58:13] <+Walopoh> BASED WOOLIE
[2:58:14] <%brachydios777> This is definitely my favorite
[2:58:14] <$RyTYoung> @halospaz117 so true
[2:58:15] <%FuqBoiSlim> Based Reach
[2:58:15] <%slimmixrp> @derap41 Nailed it
[2:58:15] <+taggerung403> Noble team is dudes, MC is the guy
[2:58:17] <dinnydanny777> Including the Planet
[2:58:18] <Snakes_dk> the crew
[2:58:19] <+Ancopro> but woolie it has sprinting sooo
[2:58:20] <phatmac16> BASED WOOLIE
[2:58:20] <+mechslayer71> This is my favorite personally
[2:58:21] <Lunaar> it's the self-insert spin-off - which is fuckin rad
[2:58:23] <Yummy_Nukes> down to reach approach
[2:58:27] <%slppanther29> MY favorite Halo, this was my Halo 3 when I was a kid
[2:58:28] <Bossingtonhuggermugger> Now lets resurrect the grave for HALO 4 whoooooooo
[2:58:29] <andre11dr> Covenant being scary, also a great ending
[2:58:31] <%nxflre> HEAVY- Died via explosion Brains- Headshotted Stealth- Disappeared Leader- Went down with the ship BRawler- Gets stabbed Lone Wolf- Dies alone
[2:58:32] <%Halospaz117> This was all Arby's fault btw
[2:58:37] <letshavecakes> The trilogy is like a solo superhero movie, whereas the spinoffs have a really cool team vibe
[2:58:38] <%doomerskeletor13> And Noble Six is YOU. You passed the torch to Master Chief
[2:58:40] <phatmac16> the tone is better
[2:58:42] <+azzynpc> Would you say its the gritty, boots on the ground feel @woolieversus
[2:58:44] <Joestar1890> Same, Woolz. SUPER close, but Arby tho
[2:58:45] <andre11dr> This has a better ending for sure
[2:58:48] <Roach3s> in terms of endings Reach >>>>>
[2:58:48] <phatmac16> STRONG ASS ENDING
[2:58:49] <$RyTYoung> SURVIVE
[2:58:51] <ThePimpGuin> Arby shoulda killed ya
[2:58:52] <dinnydanny777> Halo 4's opening is fantastic even if people don't like the rest of the game
[2:58:53] <ghostspartan80> Halo 0
[2:58:53] <iamtheTwitchghost> it really is a strong ending
[2:58:55] <%doomerskeletor13> It’s a strong ending
[2:58:56] <armchairmaster_> Reminder everyone: if it wasn't for Emile FUCKING UP, Six would have been fighting with Chief the whole time. Remember that every time you see that dumb skull face.
[2:58:59] <zashrin777> I can't wait for you to hear the ost for ODST, Woolie
[2:59:00] <letshavecakes> oh my god
[2:59:02] <%Penguin93> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[2:59:03] <IndoorSitup> Cortana was created by Halsey. The thing you're delivering is a fragment of Cortana that has been analyzing the Forerunner artifact that was underground. This is NOT a spoiler.
[2:59:03] <Bossingtonhuggermugger> She's decrypting
[2:59:04] <Nomad94> Please not again
[2:59:07] <%Halospaz117> It was a fragment I think
[2:59:08] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus She was being used to study it
[2:59:09] <Bossingtonhuggermugger> she big compooper
[2:59:10] <DemonicHoward> you are suppose to know
[2:59:10] <+YabbaTroll> shes just vibing
[2:59:13] <+taggerung403> V NotLikeThis
[2:59:14] <+Kotyc_> w r LUL n g
[2:59:14] <%seniormeatbox> Watch Halo Legends woolie
[2:59:14] <Torivore> I think 5 has the best co op because of not p2p connection
[2:59:15] <+Alfax> Please don't do this again
[2:59:15] <derap41> Writers give different reasons
[2:59:15] <Self_esteampunk> we explain the story
[2:59:16] <%huskarl_zap> She was made there
[2:59:18] <%FuqBoiSlim> AAAAAAAH
[2:59:18] <%doomerskeletor13> She’s just helping Halsey analyze Forerunner stuff
[2:59:19] <%brachydios777> Oh boy
[2:59:20] <%Solidnick18> She just chilling
[2:59:20] <LoganPayne> Because Halsey. It's not even hard.
[2:59:20] <Nomad94> Let's not
[2:59:21] <%krispen_wa> Cortana is THICCC
[2:59:21] <StarlitStunner> V why
[2:59:23] <bleugh> halo 4 now?
[2:59:23] <%huskarl_zap> she it
[2:59:23] <letshavecakes> It is literally not ever once mentioned again, and has never been retconned
[2:59:25] <+Williamld> Bungie are spiteful is how
[2:59:25] <+Walopoh> jermaSun jermaSun jermaSun
[2:59:28] <thebalticguy1> ITS EASY
[2:59:29] <%subjectg> It’s explained, that’s all I’ll say
[2:59:30] <%Tearonex> Tearonex subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! Congrats Woolie and V, you've beaten Bungie's amazing send off game for the Halo series! Also there is a theory that the Golden Elite that shows up at the very end of 6's last stand is the Arbiter because he's holding the energy sword in his left hand
[2:59:30] <centuronstar> No no. Bungie retconned some stuff
[2:59:30] <%DatAsuna> No it's just V misinterpreting a simple line, kinda like swtor lol
[2:59:34] <Sullry> its just wording
[2:59:36] <+IntrepidEye> Its not a retcon just something not really explained in the game
[2:59:36] <+stef5949> Reeeeee!
[2:59:36] <Bossingtonhuggermugger> Cortona is Halseys AI
[2:59:38] <%brave_sj> I AM ANGRY. ANGRY ABOUT LORE.
[2:59:39] <%DatAsuna> there's nothing there
[2:59:42] <%Solidnick18> SourPls
[2:59:42] <Mcjiggyjay> i think its explained mostly in the fall of reach book
[2:59:44] <+QueequegTheater> Close enough
[2:59:44] <Yummy_Nukes> bungie HATES lore!!!
[2:59:48] <ThePimpGuin> destroy droid those mines
[2:59:48] <Nomad94> It's just fine
[2:59:48] <+YabbaTroll> SourPls
[2:59:49] <letshavecakes> Well, it's close enough
[2:59:49] <+Ancopro> Halsey took a mushroom and honey syrup and
[2:59:50] <wombatlime> Yes Close enough
[2:59:50] <+HostileNitrile> You are supposed to know, it's explained in the lore book of Halsey's journal from the special edition of the game
[2:59:51] <+D00msDayDan> i'm so triggered right now
[2:59:52] <bearwagon> its fine
[2:59:55] <%Solidnick18> sure
[2:59:58] <%Theycallmenerf> Solved
[2:59:59] <%subjectg> close enough
[2:59:59] <%derap41> She farted Cortana out
[3:00:00] <%doomerskeletor13> Good enough
[3:00:02] <+Walopoh> Halsey used these gnarly space ingredients to make Cortana
[3:00:02] <+taggerung403> Close enough
[3:00:03] <letshavecakes> It is NOT THAT COMPLICATED
[3:00:03] <Bossingtonhuggermugger> Lmao close enough
[3:00:03] <%Brassnarwhal> @tearonex it's all but confirmed that that can't be the arbiter
[3:00:06] <%Kazuhira_Boat> Yea
[3:00:07] <+QueequegTheater> As long as Woolie doesn't think Cortana is a forerunner AI
[3:00:10] <%slppanther29> Close enough
[3:00:12] <dreadedcthulhu> that is exactly how much explanation woolie needed and I wish the rest of our halo guy friends would be like that more lol
[3:00:13] <Joestar1890> DEFINITELY
[3:00:14] <iamtheTwitchghost> nice
[3:00:14] <ghostspartan80> can't wait for the smartass comments
[3:00:15] <%SirGO0SE> PogChamp
[3:00:16] <ProtoShawk> Strong agree
[3:00:16] <%RioGascar> this is why i had to send that message explaining the lore dumps. BUNGIE BAD AT THIS SHIT and its infuriating at times
[3:00:18] <Firststrike_OW> I agree with that
[3:00:19] <wombatlime> STRONGE LIST
[3:00:19] <%seniormeatbox> Can't fuckin WAIT FOR ODST
[3:00:19] <%doomerskeletor13> Halsey is enigmatic so I understand the confusion
[3:00:20] <%MacabreOpus> Agree
[3:00:21] <+ntfth> The stuff with the special edition explained it.
[3:00:22] <%Kazuhira_Boat> O D S T
[3:00:22] <zashrin777> A good top 3
[3:00:23] <+Walopoh> IT'S SO SIMPLE
[3:00:23] <0rond> did he skip odst?
[3:00:26] <%doomerskeletor13> I agree Woolie
[3:00:27] <IndoorSitup> Can't wait to see him to play ODST.
[3:00:29] <+grim_alex95> Man I’m so glad I still have the special edition for this game
[3:00:31] <+taggerung403> ODST aint out yet
[3:00:32] <Bossingtonhuggermugger> Dunno why they skipped ODST
[3:00:32] <%The_Swedish_X> Odst isn’t on pc
[3:00:32] <Joestar1890> BIG agree
[3:00:32] <%DarkestVegemite> Top 10 lore facts that Bungie and 343 DONT want you to know
[3:00:36] <%Pinkiefan> Odst wasn't out
[3:00:36] <%seniormeatbox> @0rond ODST isn't out on PC yet
[3:00:38] <%Kazuhira_Boat> CAN"T wait for smooth jazz
[3:00:40] <armchairmaster_> Time for ODST PogChamp
[3:00:41] <torres_kun> Last game is ODST, right chat? I’m jk
[3:00:42] <DPmusique> Covenant seemed BRUTAL
[3:00:42] <%hattrick61> Can't blame you, that's what I thought at first too "This AI is it's custodian" seems pretty definite
[3:00:43] <%doomerskeletor13> If you like the group vibe of this game you’re gonna love ODST
[3:00:44] <%PirateDad_> Woolie with the respectable opinions
[3:00:44] <Bossingtonhuggermugger> I thought they was on xbox
[3:00:45] <Joestar1890> @Bossingtonhuggermugger It's not out on PC yet
[3:00:46] <Nomad94> re-threatening the Covenant
[3:00:46] <letshavecakes> ODST will be on PC in a couple weeks
[3:00:47] <countnostalgia> "Re-Threatening" is a good way to put it
[3:00:52] <Lunaar> the Ferengi
[3:00:53] <%Theycallmenerf> Does Woolie now acquire a taste for, free form jazz?
[3:00:54] <ghostspartan80> them not speaking english makes them more intimidating
[3:00:54] <dinnydanny777> Halo 4 has an opening which is a massive loredump and it's great
[3:00:56] <%RioGascar> bungie had to work real hard ot make them scary again
[3:00:58] <%huskarl_zap> Lore fact number 1 spartan 4s suck
[3:01:00] <%dekkitout> @DPmusique And efficient- but not fast enough
[3:01:03] <%RioGascar> and the asnwer? make you less powerful
[3:01:07] <%MacabreOpus> Like the Stormtroopers in Mandalorian kinda
[3:01:09] <+taggerung403> The made some enemy models larger too I think
[3:01:12] <dereks0n> Like Rogue One Kappa
[3:01:14] <sw0rdmstr> Woolie needs to watch Babysitter before playing ODST. It is ESSENTIAL.
[3:01:14] <IndoorSitup> I kinda just want them to just say fuck it and play ODST on Xbox.
[3:01:18] <+taggerung403> So they looked more threatening
[3:01:20] <%derap41> The answer kill lots of civies
[3:01:27] <%Bigyanno> halsey didn't find cortana there, she was just in charge of the excavation, it's not that complicated. That's what halsey said, V is just misinterpreting it.
[3:01:28] <ghostspartan80> Elites are massive units in this too
[3:01:35] <+phatbeatsies23> He is going to like ODST
[3:01:35] <AppleBerryKitty> i wasnt here much but did they ever run into Bob chat?
[3:01:36] <Lunaar> dude I cannot WAIT for Woolie to play ODST
[3:01:46] <Nomad94> it'll be good times
[3:01:48] <%RioGascar> ODST should probably be out next week
[3:01:50] <%DianaTheAscian> The covenant is just a force of destruction in this and i love it
[3:01:52] <+Haildrops> @AppleBerryKitty He sniped BoB unknowingly in t he sniper mission
[3:01:52] <dinnydanny777> j e t p a c k
[3:01:52] <Decimated_body> Okay guys we know why woolie likes this more is because of JETPAK
[3:01:53] <zashrin777> Elites are way more fun to fight than brutes
[3:01:53] <StarlitStunner> Sabers
[3:01:54] <%subjectg> @appleberrykitty they killed one BOB in nightfall
[3:01:54] <+D00msDayDan> woolie's so easy
[3:02:00] <%Pinkiefan> ODST will probably be his favorite.
[3:02:02] <AppleBerryKitty> ah ok
[3:02:02] <%The_Swedish_X> I also love the escalation of this story in terms of threat.
[3:02:03] <+TawnyMonarch> REEEEEEE
[3:02:05] <+Msytic6> HA!
[3:02:08] <%Tearonex> Sprint is fine
[3:02:09] <Lunaar> hell yeah V, sprint forever
[3:02:10] <%krispen_wa> TRIGGERED
[3:02:11] <ghostspartan80> eh it's fine
[3:02:12] <%Halospaz117> I think sprint worked as an armor ability
[3:02:12] <Firststrike_OW> Why do people hate sprint?!
[3:02:12] <%yeeter_baelish> who doesnt like sprint?
[3:02:12] <%bPlusPlus> REEEEEEEE
[3:02:12] <VidulaSaix> I agree I like it
[3:02:13] <countnostalgia> how threatening can a grunt be?
[3:02:13] <+YabbaTroll> hell yeah brother
[3:02:13] <+Grynovus> It's fine
[3:02:14] <$Sfaux97> lol
[3:02:14] <Joestar1890> Sprint is nice
[3:02:14] <%derap41> Shouldn't be a power
[3:02:15] <+taggerung403> Sprint is fine
[3:02:16] <%DatAsuna> 840 pages of complaining about sprint lol
[3:02:16] <%doomerskeletor13> Sprint is fine people are baby
[3:02:17] <andre11dr> LUL
[3:02:20] <thesoldierofjoy> Sprint is just fine.
[3:02:20] <+Walopoh> Bungie was the best at making the Covenant a HUGE existential threat. They don't want slaves, they don't want our planets, they just want us dead.
[3:02:20] <%Theycallmenerf> Sprint was needed
[3:02:20] <Explodincatz> it sucked
[3:02:22] <dinnydanny777> The Sprint being a power up kinda makes sense because the suits are heavy
[3:02:22] <StarlitStunner> Run fast do crimes
[3:02:23] <andre11dr> Here we go
[3:02:24] <DarkestDawn64> Evade is cool, but it's not in campaign unfortunately
[3:02:24] <%BubbaGAN0USH> its fine
[3:02:25] <dereks0n> People hating sprint is weird to me
[3:02:27] <countnostalgia> sprints ok
[3:02:27] <+azzynpc> V are you gonna have Woolie read the Forerunner Saga
[3:02:27] <pochecito> Sprint is fine I think
[3:02:28] <+Pengers> i think the way its done in reach works well
[3:02:29] <+Msytic6> I like sprint!
[3:02:30] <zashrin777> I never really minded sprint. I dislike the halo 5 boost though
[3:02:30] <DPmusique> I love the way armor abilities were implimented for spartan III's, Sprint was great as a pickup, making it standard in 4 was dumb
[3:02:32] <wombatlime> Sprint is fine
[3:02:32] <+Doctor_Stew> I love sprint, I hate sprint as something you dont always have
[3:02:33] <sw0rdmstr> Sprint was so good they made it a basic feature in 4.
[3:02:36] <%DianaTheAscian> i like the sprint in this being a peace of gear u can pick up
[3:02:39] <%MacabreOpus> agreed
[3:02:40] <ghostspartan80> people just worry too much about changes
[3:02:40] <%Halospaz117> Yeah it's fine in story
[3:02:40] <thenamelessant> Spirit is a nice addition, but needs some improvements
[3:02:41] <%derap41> Sprint is good having it as a power up is bad
[3:02:42] <+stef5949> bUT It'S NoT HALO!
[3:02:42] <Nomad94> ye
[3:02:44] <%seniormeatbox> Sprint is good
[3:02:46] <zashrin777> Or saving best ghost girl
[3:02:46] <Roach3s> 👍
[3:02:47] <%RioGascar> sprint hated in multiplayer because maps were not designed for it a lot of the times is the general explaination
[3:02:47] <+TawnyMonarch> its actually fine in campaign, esp in larger areas/maps, for pvp it doesnt help
[3:02:52] <+Atomicusurper> halo 5 did sprint right from a competitive standpoint
[3:02:52] <Lunaar> dedicated sprint button in H4 was a good 343 addition
[3:02:55] <%doomerskeletor13> Woolie is right and he should say it
[3:02:56] <armchairmaster_> Sprint is F I N E, but other armor abilities should be pickups for multiplayer, not loadouts
[3:03:01] <andre11dr> Sprint is totally fine, but then again i never played Halo 5
[3:03:03] <%Pinkiefan> Sprint should not have been a powerup
[3:03:05] <Yummy_Nukes> @woolieversus does the master chief version of reach still have theater mode? because being able to fly the camera around in a level you played through was the coolest shit Kreygasm
[3:03:06] <milhousego> what mission are we on?
[3:03:08] <%MajoraZ> Sprint's a meme issue that people make way too much a big deal out of. Both pro and anti sprint people are way too worked up on it.
[3:03:11] <%Theycallmenerf> Sprint is good chat, fight me
[3:03:12] <DPmusique> Sprint is better as an optional pickup
[3:03:13] <SoaringLettuce> everything is fine in single player, shits fucked in multi
[3:03:15] <%doomerskeletor13> @milhousego They finished
[3:03:15] <%The_Swedish_X> Game beat
[3:03:18] <%ChoculaUltra> they coulda just not had the sprint power-up in multiplayer and I think the community would've been fine with it being a campaign /firefight only thing
[3:03:19] <%Manjove> i have no problem with it being equuipment but i dont like it being default controls
[3:03:20] <Joestar1890> @Yummy_Nukes Yeah, it does
[3:03:20] <%Solidnick18> yeah
[3:03:21] <countnostalgia> *cough* *cough* Infinite
[3:03:23] <ghostspartan80> sprint isn't a power up in Halo 4 at least
[3:03:24] <shitter_pounder_69> i just wish you could shoot and reload while sprinting
[3:03:25] <dereks0n> More video games need panic speed hustle
[3:03:26] <Lunaar> @Yummy_Nukes yup, been doing it myself lately
[3:03:27] <dinnydanny777> Sprint is kind of fun in Halo 4 because you can really run and gun with weapons like the assault rifle
[3:03:28] <%Solidnick18> you just zoop
[3:03:33] <%GreenCMD> sprint is an issue in 343 halo but jetpack was way more game breaking in reach pvp
[3:03:39] <DPmusique> It's better as a pickup
[3:03:40] <Yummy_Nukes> noice PogChamp
[3:03:43] <%DemonOfSalt> Sprint is now part of T-Mobile. /ba dum tiss
[3:03:45] <countnostalgia> we need jetpack back
[3:03:50] <+DazedCookies> The problem is sprint is an armor ability
[3:03:51] <Sullry> sprint is the illusion of movment tec
[3:03:52] <%doomerskeletor13> Sprint is great people just BabyRage
[3:03:54] <%ChoculaUltra> jetpack + sniper + map knowledge = gg every reach multi game LUL
[3:03:59] <Lunaar> CLOAK
[3:04:01] <%DianaTheAscian> evade
[3:04:02] <prime_name> Hologram for me
[3:04:04] <+baronothebest> Cloak
[3:04:04] <zashrin777> CLOAK
[3:04:04] <+YabbaTroll> cloak
[3:04:05] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Fun fact, PlayStation All-Stars had rollback
[3:04:05] <+TawnyMonarch> @Sullry precisely
[3:04:07] <VidulaSaix> Hologram
[3:04:07] <%RioGascar> the worst one is hologram ORIGINALLY
[3:04:08] <heartlesshealer> hmm
[3:04:09] <DFireCreations> camo was poopoo
[3:04:09] <%RunningNGunning> cloak
[3:04:11] <IndoorSitup> Active Camo is bad.
[3:04:13] <%doomerskeletor13> Hologram
[3:04:15] <Torivore> As far as comp goes, it'd have gone over better if there were maps and gamemode combos made for no sprint
[3:04:15] <%Theycallmenerf> Evade
[3:04:15] <%RioGascar> but mcc FIXED the hologram
[3:04:16] <Lunaar> camo sucks the peepee
[3:04:17] <ghostspartan80> hologram or camo
[3:04:18] <spidervenomized> camo
[3:04:18] <stormhawk9891> Evade
[3:04:19] <StarlitStunner> Evade is great
[3:04:20] <+Ancopro> camo is pretty bad
[3:04:22] <Chainsaw105> unfortunately "Evade" isn't in campaign
[3:04:22] <thenamelessant> decoy
[3:04:23] <andre11dr> Stealth i never used
[3:04:27] <thenamelessant> evade
[3:04:27] <IndoorSitup> Active Camo was neutered hard in this game.
[3:04:27] <SoaringLettuce> to explain to people that don't know, sprint in multiplayer started the transformation into COD in multiplayer
[3:04:28] <zashrin777> Yeah camo is not great in this
[3:04:32] <%DianaTheAscian> is Evade in the campaign?
[3:04:33] <%The_Swedish_X> Camo relies on not moving a lot, so I never cared for it.
[3:04:34] <+Archphronimos> camo isn't great in PVE
[3:04:40] <raikagelord1> Did They even use Evade?
[3:04:40] <DigitalJoshie> yeah
[3:04:40] <%MacabreOpus> Camo is caca
[3:04:41] <%alpacasintophats> they haven't seen Evade since it's not in the campaign
[3:04:41] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:04:43] <zashrin777> @DianaTheAscian nah
[3:04:45] <+Archphronimos> came is amazing multi
[3:04:46] <%AceOne5> Decoy is good before engaging but at no other point :/
[3:04:47] <DarkestDawn64> @DianaTheAscian Evade is not in camaign
[3:04:50] <IndoorSitup> Camo was neutered HARD in this game.
[3:04:52] <%brave_sj> Camo's movement thing is bs
[3:04:53] <%subjectg> Camo is great in LASO, i’ve never ever found hologram useful
[3:04:54] <+D00msDayDan> halo tradition, not fps tradition
[3:04:54] <wahilliham> evade is for elites only in multiplayer, but it feels really good
[3:04:57] <DigitalJoshie> it's something in this game, so camo suffers from it
[3:04:58] <+Haildrops> Camo was nerfed for multiplayer because it was so readily available
[3:04:58] <%DatAsuna> It's just comp meta, minimal time to aim
[3:05:00] <Bossingtonhuggermugger> So camo is useless M+K
[3:05:04] <DPmusique> I like to think of the came pickup as a prototype copy
[3:05:06] <+Ancopro> camo is free radar jam in multi but pve don't care
[3:05:08] <DPmusique> camo
[3:05:08] <Lunaar> Evade is TECHNICALLY an "Elite ability" but still
[3:05:13] <countnostalgia> fuck the motion tracker
[3:05:15] <Lunaar> I really like evade
[3:05:15] <%MacabreOpus> Don't recall hologram ever working for me in MP
[3:05:16] <CrypticMochi> There was that radar jammer right?
[3:05:24] <+Haildrops> jammer is part of camo
[3:05:24] <%Javaa01> Nija
[3:05:26] <+YabbaTroll> cold blooded?
[3:05:33] <Torivore> Halo 4 camo worst camo because of blue tracker jammer
[3:05:34] <+Archphronimos> the fact that cloak gives you radar jamming is amaing for multiplayer, useless for singleplayer
[3:05:34] <countnostalgia> the added radar jammer was ok I guess
[3:05:36] <DigitalJoshie> Bubble shield is my favorite, cause its the closest to a support ability
[3:05:36] <dinnydanny777> But that is DISHONOURABLE
[3:05:45] <%ChoculaUltra> I feel like Hologram worked on 360 Reach but on MCC everyone knows the trick LUL
[3:05:47] <%DianaTheAscian> okay so in the campaign cloak is the worst but evade is the worst in the game imo
[3:05:47] <StebTheVee> Hey Woolie, do you remember how each Noble Team died
[3:05:47] <andre11dr> We only saw one execution in this right?
[3:05:59] <%subjectg> Using the heartbeat sensor in MW2 LUL
[3:05:59] <Lunaar> YO, gotta mention assassinations
[3:06:03] <zashrin777> Jun the talking sniper rifle
[3:06:11] <%Theycallmenerf> Assassinations are peak
[3:06:14] <IndoorSitup> I love perks that fuck over people who have hundred dollar headsets and listens to footseps
[3:06:15] <%brachydios777> The only one to make it
[3:06:16] <%RioGascar> that experimental mission...was a nightmare if it bugs
[3:06:18] <+QueequegTheater> EM radiation from the glassing
[3:06:19] <%RioGascar> cause if it bugs
[3:06:22] <%RioGascar> restart the level
[3:06:24] <+YabbaTroll> oh fuck
[3:06:25] <%slimmixrp> Cause game logic
[3:06:28] <%slimmixrp> Radiation
[3:06:28] <+YabbaTroll> OH FUCK
[3:06:28] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Elevators are mechanical
[3:06:28] <%yeeter_baelish> NO SHUT UP THO
[3:06:28] <bearwagon> pulleys and levers
[3:06:29] <+stef5949> Cuz Shut up
[3:06:29] <Firststrike_OW> Wait...
[3:06:29] <raikagelord1> Assassinations are lit.
[3:06:29] <%brave_sj> Because shut up
[3:06:30] <+ianabstract> Elevators are mostly physics
[3:06:30] <+Archphronimos> BECAUSE VIDEO GAMES
[3:06:30] <Joestar1890> Backup Generators?
[3:06:33] <%DianaTheAscian> it wore off?
[3:06:33] <ghostspartan80> cause plot
[3:06:33] <countnostalgia> ... LUL LUL LUL LUL
[3:06:34] <+Ancopro> DAMNIT
[3:06:35] <+Williamld> Not electrical?
[3:06:35] <andre11dr> That's mechanical
[3:06:35] <WarKamex> because kat needed to die
[3:06:35] <%Halospaz117> Hardened?
[3:06:35] <Omnijackk> EMP shielding is a thing
[3:06:36] <%RunningNGunning> because shut up
[3:06:36] <%Kazuhira_Boat> SHHHHHH
[3:06:36] <%Javaa01> I mean, they shouldn't be using an elevator regardless
[3:06:36] <DemonicHoward> emp shielding
[3:06:36] <%The_Swedish_X> I still dislike the scene
[3:06:37] <+VietcongSamurai> tomatoLurk Oops
[3:06:37] <letshavecakes> The spartans were literally in front of a window
[3:06:38] <dinnydanny777> I'm still mad they got in an elevator during a fucking glassing
[3:06:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> emp shielded elevators Kappa
[3:06:38] <%brachydios777> Hmmmmm
[3:06:39] <%slimmixrp> Diesel generator
[3:06:40] <%ringabal> WOODEN GEARS
[3:06:40] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Mechanical backup

[3:06:41] <phatmac16> backup generator?
[3:06:41] <%Irridium> uuuuuuh water powered?
[3:06:41] <%slimmixrp> Gas powered
[3:06:42] <thebalticguy1> KAt talks about how her sheilds malfunction
[3:06:42] <%The_Swedish_X> On many levels
[3:06:42] <Maids4lyfe> emp shielding
[3:06:43] <+asasqw> @WoolieVersus The shield is in the helmit
[3:06:43] <%DSD24> Heel V
[3:06:46] <+sir_louis> She died to the headshot because she was playing on legendary
[3:06:46] <rytisone> squirrels running the wheel
[3:06:46] <stardustcrusad3r> a plot hold
[3:06:47] <IndoorSitup> EMP hardened.
[3:06:47] <StebTheVee> elevators had shield
[3:06:47] <%Javaa01> Im guessing it was just easier to animate then a run down a staircase
[3:06:48] <Zohare> Her arm made her shield come back slower according to people in chat that day
[3:06:48] <Paragon_Sheep> Elevators are built to fucking work unless you blow the damn thing up
[3:06:50] <SoaringLettuce> because DRAMA
[3:06:50] <anarchistPastry> i think it was her robot arm?
[3:06:50] <squidmax1> See if beam rifles were in this game we wouldn't have this problem.
[3:06:51] <%Chatterbox1991> theres dialogue earlier that talks about Kats arm fucks with her shield
[3:06:52] <zashrin777> Maybe the blast knocked the shields out cause of force?
[3:06:52] <stayinthepocket> PLOT HOLE SHIT GAME!!
[3:06:52] <LoganPayne> It was the one jackal with a covenant sniper from 2
[3:06:54] <tidalwafer> that elevator was all analog
[3:06:54] <Divryne> Nah don't think about it dude.
[3:06:55] <%brave_sj> The game has to happen
[3:06:56] <DPmusique> Maybe cuz it was underground
[3:06:56] <%doomerskeletor13> Because drama
[3:06:56] <poweruser> an elaborate system of pulleys
[3:06:57] <VidulaSaix> LUL
[3:06:57] <+ianabstract> Elevator has pretty simple electronics, no computer chips
[3:06:58] <%krispen_wa> There was a secret big man carrying the elevator
[3:06:58] <DigitalJoshie> there is an explanation but it's inEU stuff
[3:06:58] <+tristonobv> I always figured it was from her hacking thing right before fucked it up
[3:06:59] <%yeeter_baelish> YEYEYEYE
[3:06:59] <+mechslayer71> Elevators are technically mechanical tho
[3:06:59] <dereks0n> Either EMP shielded building or just more rudimentary technology
[3:07:00] <Lunaar> i mean we can think of "reasons" but at the end of the day, it wasn't explained
[3:07:00] <%Theycallmenerf> EMP Shielded?
[3:07:01] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Elevators have mechanical backups
[3:07:01] <%huskarl_zap> shields weaker near the head for somereason
[3:07:01] <KnivesEve> cause writing
[3:07:02] <Firststrike_OW> Clap
[3:07:02] <+ntfth> Kat mentioned her shields were malfunctioning too earlier.
[3:07:02] <LoganPayne> Data pads?
[3:07:03] <zashrin777> Its all conjecture
[3:07:03] <+cowardman93> the script said so
[3:07:03] <%Halospaz117> Could be hardened from EMP for evac purposes?
[3:07:03] <Zayasu> Kappa //
[3:07:04] <%derap41> Does elevator have microchips
[3:07:04] <%DianaTheAscian> @WoolieVersus shut up have feeling says reach
[3:07:04] <Reisadan> HAHAHA military grade
[3:07:05] <%MacabreOpus> GAS POWERED STICK
[3:07:05] <+Walopoh> BAD GAME BAD GAME
[3:07:05] <%God_Of_Oreos> they had a grunt on a hamster wheel powering it
[3:07:06] <Joestar1890> Clap
[3:07:06] <Explodincatz> Clap
[3:07:07] <%GraceTBM> I assume it's just that the shield doesn't work with the helmet off
[3:07:08] <Drchandragupta> elevators are mechanical, not electric
[3:07:08] <%dekkitout> Good clean propane
[3:07:08] <dinnydanny777> Imagine getting in an elevator during a glassing, Spartans don't have any knowledge of fire safety
[3:07:08] <resloxxx> Clap
[3:07:08] <abelincoln_catpuncher> because bad writing lol
[3:07:09] <pi_in_the_sci> Ruggedized hardening against EMP needs inches of armor
[3:07:09] <vulkan_vibes> her shields take longer to recharge
[3:07:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i clapped
[3:07:11] <Chainsaw105> they're moving down because of 5 2-ton spartans stepping in and pushing it down with weight
[3:07:11] <andre11dr> Clap
[3:07:14] <Paragon_Sheep> Legit, elevators are Built To Work No Matter What
[3:07:14] <%uhgoat> You’re asking too many questions. We gotta take him out back
[3:07:15] <+Helljump3r6> they are talking about radiation spikes just before so maybe that nuked their shields?
[3:07:16] <+IntrepidEye> EMP hardening but hardening doesn't mean immunity. Some things will be more affected than others
[3:07:17] <+Doctor_Stew> I mean isn't the sheild emmited energy?
[3:07:17] <+Archphronimos> oh yeah Kat's shields were already borked, she mentions it
[3:07:19] <Yummy_Nukes> she was standing next to a window
[3:07:20] <DemonicHoward> careful of donations
[3:07:25] <dinnydanny777> You don't get in an elevator during a fire let alone during a glassing
[3:07:25] <twoah> There were grunts running in a wheel powering the elevator
[3:07:28] <%The_Swedish_X> They had a one off comment somewhere that is ultimately contrived
[3:07:30] <%mitchteck> idk
[3:07:32] <prime_name> I love that in every fanfiction about Reach the writer always keeps Kat alive and the rest dead. @WoolieVersus
[3:07:34] <%Theycallmenerf> I can’t wait to watch the VOD
[3:07:40] <Reisadan> no one in the military would stan for 'military grade' stuff
[3:07:40] <letshavecakes> oh jesus
[3:07:41] <vulkan_vibes> her shields were fucked up overall
[3:07:42] <xthejewbear00x> I loved your guys' kotor2 series
[3:07:46] <+taggerung403> Kat is the only available waifu in the game
[3:07:46] <%huskarl_zap> wat

[3:08:09] <+Haildrops> dot never picked an avatar

[3:09:29] <Reisadan> Craig the greatest
[3:09:30] <+TawnyMonarch> MOOOOOONKE
[3:09:30] <%Solidnick18> monkey man
[3:09:32] <%ChoculaUltra> there's probably a book on the guy who asks you if you want to keep your look controls inverted LUL
[3:09:35] <Sullry> that elite is cool
[3:09:36] <%Theycallmenerf> PLEASE DONT SPOIL
[3:09:37] <countnostalgia> Blademaster bois!! PogChamp PogChamp
[3:09:37] <+Archphronimos> Ya-yap
[3:09:38] <heartlesshealer> A "named" character
[3:09:40] <andre11dr> It's so stupid edgy LUL
[3:09:41] <zashrin777> Last time 343 tried to do a vergil we got spartan locke and it sucked
[3:09:43] <%jaygee303> Elite Vergil
[3:09:44] <%RunningNGunning> Never forget Craig
[3:09:46] <%Theycallmenerf> Let Woolie experience it in Infinite
[3:09:46] <rytisone> Nemesis everywhere system
[3:09:47] <+baronothebest> Well there was a rival character in 5 too lmao
[3:09:48] <letshavecakes> He's pretty sick looking, in that edgy teenager kinda way
[3:09:49] <%AceOne5> the Carmine of Halo
[3:09:50] <thatd00doverthere> yooo woolie
[3:09:50] <Reisadan> C'rai'guh
[3:09:56] <@Solidus_113> https://twitter.com/LittleVMills/status/1300865998850007041?s=20
[3:09:58] <+Posh_Cat> A rival character... like in 5
[3:09:58] <+taggerung403> Its like Star Wars, every background character has a life
[3:10:00] <%derap41> Reach has cool armors
[3:10:03] <%derap41> very flat
[3:10:05] <Mcjiggyjay> the dudes in infinte come from halo wars
[3:10:16] <%Halospaz117> Samus is good
[3:10:16] <%Chatterbox1991> @woolieversus also V Buildings can be EMP hardened
[3:10:17] <%MacabreOpus> The term "military grade" is disingenuous, it's Paul Marketing speech for civilians to purchase products, when 9/10 of the times the civilian grade product is actually more functional and operational than the military tech given through cheap, tacky army supplier contracts
[3:10:21] <+Archphronimos> Varia suit is lit as fuck
[3:10:21] <StebTheVee> I like the Titanfall pilots
[3:10:25] <%Brassnarwhal> What about like space marines from 40k wooly?
[3:10:27] <+duskrush> oh cool, it's reach day
[3:10:28] <prime_name> Light Suit Samus is my favorite
[3:10:31] <rodreeg91> Cheer500 - Hey Woolie, so now that you've beaten my favorite, I want you to imagine what it was like in 2010. This was Bungie' final Halo. and while playing this, we knew that. So that ending you saw, with Bungie's final message to the fans, gave the feels man. The only thing I could even compare it to, is the feeling i got at DMC 5 ending, when Legacy is playing and Nero gets his DT. Thats why this is my favorite, alongside fighting only the Covenant
[3:10:31] <%akman14> What do you call people attracted to armor?
[3:10:32] <%Brassnarwhal> they have big big armor
[3:10:35] <dinnydanny777> Emile deserved more lore
[3:10:36] <Where_U_Bin_Laden> warhammer 40k
[3:10:41] <%sssoapy> zero suit tho
[3:10:49] <+QueequegTheater> @akman14 Adeptus Astartes
[3:10:58] <+Posh_Cat> So woolie likes Fotus armour?
[3:10:59] <+YabbaTroll> dayum
[3:10:59] <slix3431> @akman14 Suities
[3:11:00] <%derap41> Marines is the most boring aspect of 40k maybe only Chaos is lamer
[3:11:05] <%DianaTheAscian> eat shit
[3:11:06] <%subjectg> Light suit samus forever
[3:11:09] <Dova573> Emile is just singing his song, Everyday is a SALEE

[3:13:33] <+jetjagger222> and the stealth expert disappeared from the plot
[3:13:36] <letshavecakes> Origins are technically mentioned in 4, but not the thing that happened in this game

[3:14:36] <%Theycallmenerf> Thom is a really good song by Joji
[3:14:45] <%ChoculaUltra> Joji is great.
[3:14:47] <IndoorSitup> Raycevick is overrated as fuck
[3:14:50] <+DazedCookies> The OG noble 6 dies in a trailer and saves kat
[3:14:59] <ralphfromdk> Lemma guess... it's "never forget"?
[3:15:06] <+Haildrops> he didn't really save kat, he just finished her mission @DazedCookies
[3:15:16] <%derap41> So who died best
[3:15:19] <+QueequegTheater> BUT WHAT IF HE LIVED THO
[3:15:23] <Snakes_dk> And now Halo Legends
[3:15:25] <%heartlesshealer> heartlesshealer subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Enjoy money. Also thanks for putting up with all of us
[3:15:26] <%Halospaz117> Lone Wolf does take place a good amount of time after Pillar of Autumn, so Six held out for a while
[3:15:28] <%doomerskeletor13> Cheer500 glad you liked the game so much Woolie! it’s the first Halo I got super into, spent so many days playing it with my buds. When you called it Rogue One in the first session I laughed so hard, you didn’t know how right you were. I love the fact that Noble Six is YOU, and you hand off the torch to Master Chief. Such a perfect love letter to the fans imo. Keep it real Woolie and V, love your content
[3:15:29] <+CSNG> V looks like he's getting ready to play an audio clip
[3:15:30] <%DomunDomunDomun> @derap41 Jun Kappa
[3:15:30] <dinnydanny777> Kat really didn't get to do enough when she was on screen
[3:15:33] <%Andrizzleton> Remember Reach
[3:15:34] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Wrong
[3:15:34] <$RyTYoung> sure
[3:15:35] <countnostalgia> Apperently Noble Six survived for 3 weeks on Reach until he finally succumed to his wounds
[3:15:36] <%Theycallmenerf> Gimme gimme lore, gimme gimme lore
[3:15:38] <IndoorSitup> WRONG
[3:15:40] <+YabbaTroll> very wrong
[3:15:41] <%Halospaz117> Naaaaah
[3:15:44] <Nomad94> as long as you can
[3:15:44] <%alpacasintophats> very very wrong
[3:15:44] <%RioGascar> you'll run out of ammo
[3:15:46] <%krispen_wa> it cant be because he went to Halo
[3:15:48] <+Williamld> Arbiter never went ground level
[3:15:48] <%Halospaz117> Arby would be after the Autumn at that point
[3:15:49] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Arbiter is following the Pillar of Autumn
[3:15:49] <%doomerskeletor13> That’s wrong
[3:15:50] <rsg220> That grunt in the background, he's a Jedi
[3:15:54] <+taggerung403> TEMPLAR ELITES PogChamp
[3:15:54] <IndoorSitup> So many ONE GUYS.
[3:15:55] <+YabbaTroll> arbies chasing the Autumn
[3:15:55] <%neraren> Fight For Ev Er *clap clap clapclapclap*
[3:15:57] <%nxflre> Theres even a wraith
[3:16:02] <Sullry> thats a dumb theory
[3:16:03] <immortan_joel> arby is at the ring
[3:16:05] <%Tearonex> Yeah I know I'm wrong, I meant to put was a theory XD
[3:16:07] <%derap41> You litterally can't de enough damage to kill them
[3:16:08] <%Javaa01> You run out of health
[3:16:09] <Explodincatz> u just melee forever
[3:16:11] <stormhawk9891> And that version is canon
[3:16:13] <+Archphronimos> there are guns everywhere, Wraiths spawn outside the combat arena
[3:16:16] <coreyyotto> Too dangerous to move out to grab the guns
[3:16:16] <stardustcrusad3r> da arbiter himself comes out and kills u
[3:16:17] <DigitalJoshie> imagine in DMC, bloody palace becomes just Vergils
[3:16:22] <rytisone> rip and tear until it's done
[3:16:23] <%subjectg> There’s also a BOB that shows up at the very end
[3:16:23] <dinnydanny777> Why did the Covenant keep sending men instead of just glassing the planet
[3:16:25] <DFireCreations> pretty sure it cuts off around 30 min
[3:16:28] <zashrin777> sure is
[3:16:30] <DemonsEcho272> Wraiths are the worst, the spawn outside the boundry.
[3:16:32] <$RyTYoung> FANON
[3:16:32] <%krispen_wa> a Halo REACH
[3:16:35] <%Halospaz117> It is absolutley fanon

[3:16:42] <andre11dr> FANDOOM
[3:16:43] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Also, Arbiter is following the Pillar when Six dies
[3:16:46] <Firststrike_OW> LUL
[3:16:47] <xthejewbear00x> good one krispen
[3:16:47] <%alpacasintophats> the arby thing was a woolieONEGUY thing
[3:16:49] <%RioGascar> be thankful these fan theories arent fucking MASTER CHEIFS FACEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[3:16:50] <countnostalgia> Arbiter is a shipmaster, hes too busy
[3:16:51] <zashrin777> its bad
[3:16:52] <DigitalJoshie> people even think Johnson and Six are alive still
[3:16:55] <%Theycallmenerf> ResidentSleeper muh fan fic
[3:16:56] <%Solidnick18> really reaching on that
[3:16:58] <+Walopoh> yes, totally :)
[3:16:59] <+Haildrops> @dinnydanny777 they only glassed about 30% of the surface, it's a massive expensive effort
[3:17:00] <+mechslayer71> Why would he be on the ground? He’s the leader of the whole fleet
[3:17:01] <%Tearonex> the answer is always yes LUL
[3:17:06] <+ntfth> Hey Woolie, just a little nonstory bit of trivia about the Supercarrier Jorge took out. It was 28.9 kilometers long. Larger than Vader's ship the Executor.
[3:17:07] <misterurbanthelegend> bringin it back to theories
[3:17:11] <rsg220> but the guy in Empire Strikes Back with the ice cream maker, he's a secret Jedi who killed like 50 stormtroopers
[3:17:20] <%krispen_wa> DU DU DU DAAAAA
[3:17:21] <stardustcrusad3r> i wonder if we ever got the jackal that killed kat
[3:17:21] <%derap41> Its not as "iconic"
[3:17:25] <dinnydanny777> No but chanting in the bathrooms
[3:17:25] <%Brassnarwhal> @mechslayer71 this man knows what hes saying
[3:17:27] <%doomerskeletor13> That’s not a fan thing that’s legit their intention
[3:17:29] <%RioGascar> it had a main theme
[3:17:33] <rytisone> it had a little bit of it
[3:17:33] <%Halospaz117> My favorite Halo song is Unforgotten
[3:17:35] <dinnydanny777> But do the chant in the batheoom

[3:17:49] <%brave_sj> Cheer500 One last bit of dumb lore: Bungie teased Reach with a memorial statue to Noble Team erected after the war. The statue doesn't include Six, realistically because there's no canon Six because build-a-spartan, but canonically you and your achievements have been wiped from the record because you did black ops shit before Noble that ONI doesn't want going public years later. Fuck ONI

[3:18:33] <+mechslayer71> That was fine LUL LUL LUL
[3:18:34] <+azzynpc> ok but now put on "Ashes" from the Reach Soundtrack
[3:18:34] <$RyTYoung> I literally stared at that main menu for like 6 minutes straight, it's so beautiful
[3:18:35] <%RioGascar> it does not show up sadly, only in halo 2 main menu. BUT you can mod it in
[3:18:37] <%ChoculaUltra> Halo 2 Theme Gungnir Mix tho

[3:19:25] <Lunaar> my friend has an issue with the dialogue being hammy/tropey - but I don't mind
[3:19:25] <+Posh_Cat> the sam fischer interviews in the original splinter cell games were pretty good
[3:19:28] <%krispen_wa> Fucking Zenos from FFXIV
[3:19:30] <%doomerskeletor13> Woolie vindicated
[3:19:38] <+mechslayer71> The reach cutscenes are the best directed in the series
[3:19:43] <raikagelord1> I thought the same thing V.
[3:19:45] <pochecito> But you lose in both at the end
[3:19:52] <+QueequegTheater> @krispen_wa Zenos gets a pass beccause I fucking love how incredibly horny he is for your sword-dick
[3:19:53] <%derap41> REACH
[3:19:55] <dinnydanny777> I think Kat says her shield has issues

[3:20:36] <%derap41> Its a who cares
[3:20:37] <+QueequegTheater> Mistakes into headshots
[3:20:37] <ThePimpGuin> where's Plague when you need him
[3:20:37] <%brave_sj> The real reason is they didn't put in the beam rifle. The focus rifle truly does ruin everything
[3:20:38] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> DAMN Patton
[3:20:40] <%derap41> turn out peopel cared
[3:20:45] <+Walopoh> Woolie please we need you to be convinced that her death is the most important one in the franchise
[3:20:51] <%doomerskeletor13> Patton damn
[3:20:54] <OldManDeckardCain> Kat would have died anyway, little do we know, she ate mold just before getting headshot Kappa
[3:20:55] <DemonsEcho272> Just dont think about how Kat died.

[3:21:25] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> well done with halo
[3:21:25] <%Halospaz117> Well, Bungie was done
[3:21:27] <rytisone> Halo 4: Restarting the Fight
[3:21:28] <+QueequegTheater> "We found another fight to finish"
[3:21:28] <letshavecakes> It's not the same
[3:21:34] <%Irridium> wen Halo Spartan Assault
[3:21:35] <%doomerskeletor13> Well it was Bungies finale
[3:21:36] <+Archphronimos> that's the true true
[3:21:37] <%Brassnarwhal> spartan ops or spartan assault or whatever
[3:21:37] <+QueequegTheater> 4 is really good
[3:21:39] <%krispen_wa> 4 is okay
[3:21:40] <dinnydanny777> 4's Intro might be one of the best
[3:21:40] <Nomad94> We Found More Finishable Fights
[3:21:43] <%doomerskeletor13> I love 4
[3:21:43] <DigitalJoshie> Halo gacha?
[3:21:43] <%brave_sj> It's just ok
[3:21:45] <%Halospaz117> Eh I think the plan was always to have someone else pick up the slack
[3:21:46] <+Posh_Cat> 4 is good?
[3:21:46] <%RioGascar> 343I came around 2009ish possibly and starting pre-production for halo 4
[3:21:48] <%Tearonex> 4 is pretty good 5 is pretty rough
[3:21:49] <+Ancopro> i rmember liking 4
[3:21:49] <%Halospaz117> And yeah i agree 4 is good
[3:21:50] <Firststrike_OW> 4 is alright
[3:21:50] <dinnydanny777> The intro to 4 is incredible
[3:21:50] <Bossingtonhuggermugger> We're gonna restart the fight!
[3:21:50] <wombatlime> Its meh
[3:21:51] <+tristonobv> I really like 4
[3:21:51] <xthejewbear00x> 4 is ok
[3:21:54] <+QueequegTheater> @Posh_Cat Yes
[3:21:54] <countnostalgia> Oof and Bungie's soul was gone too
[3:21:56] <andre11dr> I would've love a game where you play as the Covenant with ONI as villains
[3:21:58] <%Irridium> 4 is fine
[3:22:00] <ralphfromdk> Or Bethesda to Obsidian :o
[3:22:00] <%doomerskeletor13> I love 4, I hate 5
[3:22:01] <%DatAsuna> Or Bethesda to Obsidian
[3:22:02] <+mechslayer71> 4 is fine at best
[3:22:06] <%Bigyanno> 4's main issue is the not great new guns and enemies imo
[3:22:09] <+Posh_Cat> might have ti try and play it again
[3:22:09] <%RyTYoung> RyTYoung subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! Hey Woolie and V! I saw you interest in Pope Robot fighting in Serious Sam 4! Me and my friend back in the day played through the first two Serious Sam games through online co-op and had a blast. It's definitely aged in some aspects, but still good fun!
[3:22:12] <%Kazuhira_Boat> Or bethesda to Obsidian
[3:22:12] <+mechslayer71> 5 is doodoo tho
[3:22:16] <%krispen_wa> Or Obsidian to Obsidian
[3:22:23] <%RioGascar> and that lead writer? joe staton
[3:22:24] <Dapper_Cactuar> @mechslayer71 no it hit her helmet horizontally. The spike would have had to curve quite a bit in mid air
[3:22:26] <xthejewbear00x> halo 2 will be forever my favorite halos, a lot of memories
[3:22:28] <OldManDeckardCain> watch woolie love 5 jsut like korra LUL
[3:22:29] <mdkcde> halo 4 is unbearebly boring
[3:22:31] <dinnydanny777> 4 Isn't bad at all, it's just not as good as the previous games
[3:22:38] <Nomad94> 4 is good
[3:22:39] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus The first and last level of Bungie Halo is Pillar of Autumn
[3:22:45] <Yummy_Nukes> Female spartans in halo 4 have no butt 0/10
[3:22:51] <+mechslayer71> @dapper_cactuar it looked like the got in the back of the head to me, but ehe
[3:22:54] <+mechslayer71> Eh*
[3:22:57] <%CptnCampy61> 4 is fine, spartan ops mode is terrible though
[3:22:57] <%derap41> You'd think Cortana would have said something
[3:22:59] <%Halospaz117> They literally make the player the reason the series can happen, I fucking love it
[3:23:04] <%RyTYoung> That's sick
[3:23:06] <misterurbanthelegend> better than MGSVs tribute to fans.
[3:23:21] <%krispen_wa> You're Big Noble Boss now
[3:23:25] <dinnydanny777> Alternatively, SIX had no body left
[3:23:27] <countnostalgia> Noble Six canonically survived for 3 weeks in the end of the game
[3:23:30] <%RyTYoung> Yeah...Oni are the CIA
[3:23:34] <AppleBerryKitty> LOL so its like snake in metal gear
[3:23:35] <Lunaar> Schjrodinger's Spartan
[3:23:35] <letshavecakes> That statue was just a big boy version of the statue that came with the legendary edition
[3:23:36] <dinnydanny777> SIX was glassed
[3:23:36] <+QueequegTheater> It's a pretty good excuse
[3:23:37] <%brave_sj> Yeah all my homies hate ONI
[3:23:38] <%derap41> Only a little bit of Civilians murdered
[3:23:39] <%doomerskeletor13> ONI are big CIA
[3:23:40] <%DatAsuna> all my homies hate oni

[3:24:13] <%krispen_wa> FUCK DA POLICE
[3:24:13] <dinnydanny777> It's entirely possible that they didn't have a record of SIX's likeness I guess
[3:24:15] <%Solidnick18> popemoblie
[3:24:17] <DigitalJoshie> @huskarl_zap no six is just create a character
[3:24:18] <letshavecakes> The best thing KotOR 1 did was give Revan a canon appearance

[3:47:18] <%RioGascar> halo 1 ce does that
[3:47:20] <%Asuterisuku> Did Woolie notice that the helmet in the opening cutscene was his own?
[3:47:20] <Chainsaw105> no Slayer or CTF in this house! Invasion only!
[3:47:21] <%Halospaz117> It fires dreams
[3:47:21] <+mechslayer71> @twoah Nope, that’s 4, and that’s the shit people hated
[3:47:26] <%DatAsuna> Well you shield sucks

[3:47:45] <TheChucklingOak> Suuuureee you did

[3:49:23] <%RioGascar> you can do custom games
[3:49:23] <%BallerSwagBro9k> UNDO MOVE
[3:49:24] <+YabbaTroll> not matchmade
[3:49:24] <%DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus should also be able to just right click on steam and do "verify integrity" would only have to DL one file
[3:49:24] <%GeneralSCPatton> Verify File Integrity
[3:49:24] <%heartlesshealer> Can you LAN?
[3:49:27] <%Irridium> not matchmaking
[3:49:29] <%Irridium> customs yes I think
[3:49:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> CUSTOM GAMEZ YES
[3:49:32] <%huskarl_zap> verify integrity to redownload lost files
[3:49:32] <Zohare> I mean, some guy did just join you
[3:49:33] <+QueequegTheater> LAN maybe?
[3:49:34] <simulationbard> Custom games I think
[3:49:34] <Torivore> Was this Woolie's first mod experience
[3:49:34] <+Asuterisuku> You can play custom games.
[3:49:35] <%BurdRightsActivist> You can host a custom lobby
[3:49:36] <%Javaa01> No matchmaking in cheater realm
[3:49:36] <%RioGascar> you can do custom games meaning play with chat
[3:49:36] <DFireCreations> custom yes matchmaking no
[3:49:37] <%BallerSwagBro9k> DO 1V1
[3:49:37] <%AceOne5> Custom Games only
[3:49:38] <%derap41> wat
[3:49:38] <+Apokrypton> fuck it, better go run 3rd strike sets
[3:49:39] <iamtheTwitchghost> can you verify the installation on steam? @WoolieVersus
[3:49:40] <+TylerRich117> customs should be fine
[3:49:40] <%MajoraZ> @WoolieVersus you can do customs with anticheat off, yes
[3:49:41] <shamuze> delete the mod hacks and verify files through steam
[3:49:41] <+Walopoh> No matchmaking but you can do modded custom games
[3:49:41] <%heartlesshealer> then no
[3:49:43] <%BurdRightsActivist> Customs over the net
[3:49:44] <rytisone> it got Cole Protocol'd
[3:49:44] <+QueequegTheater> And that one guy
[3:49:45] <%krispen_wa> WOOLIE VERSUS MODS
[3:49:45] <%RioGascar> but yeah no cant do matchmaking
[3:49:45] <+Helljump3r6> could invite chat?
[3:49:46] <%Rosewater_444> !uptime
[3:49:47] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 49 minutes
[3:49:49] <IndoorSitup> SAVED
[3:49:49] <%heartlesshealer> yay he found it
[3:49:51] <iamtheTwitchghost> nice
[3:49:51] <rsg220> can they not just do a private lobby?
[3:49:56] <%brave_sj> Custom I think
[3:50:03] <rsg220> is that not a feature?
[3:50:07] <%brave_sj> Def not matchmaking
[3:50:12] <%Asuterisuku> I think he WANTS the MM experience.
[3:50:15] <%DomunDomunDomun> Was the alternative "copy the file from v's installation"?
[3:50:26] <TheChucklingOak> You could always 2v1 that Yabba guy
[3:50:33] <DemonicHoward> this is why you make back up folders
[3:50:34] <%heartlesshealer> steam number folder names are horrendous
[3:50:35] <zashrin777> Take your time.
[3:50:38] <letshavecakes> There was a very obvious missed option here for a fun match with followers
[3:50:47] <+TylerRich117> Always back your files up
[3:50:47] <+duskrush> You've cheated not only the game but yourself
[3:50:50] <xxshadowxx416> do cheat
[3:50:51] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ALWAYS CHEAT THO
[3:50:51] <PrideOfFiddles> "You wouldn't download a car"
[3:50:51] <cipher758> to be or not to be one guy
[3:50:52] <zashrin777> Looked snazzy in that EVA, ngl
[3:50:52] <TheChucklingOak> Don't copy that floppy
[3:50:54] <sw0rdmstr> Suddenly its "Get Into Shooter Games"
[3:50:59] <%Irridium> just wanted to look pretty
[3:50:59] <%BisoromiBear> sipsipHellmo
[3:51:01] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that's the good kind of cheating
[3:51:05] <+CSNG> Woolie caught downloading cars
[3:51:07] <letshavecakes> Delete system32
[3:51:07] <iamtheTwitchghost> GET INTO FPS GAMES
[3:51:09] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> I can't stay subbed to a cheater. It's too dishonorable

Since I showed up while you guys started the online matches, what is the worst thing someone has said to you in or related to a competitive match. This question is also to V, as he is the resident storyteller/bard.

[4:19:18] <%superc37> @woolieversus fyi woolie theres a radar jammer that activates whenever you use the camo ability, so its best to ignore the radar whenever youre invisible.
[4:19:19] <+QueequegTheater> It does that when cloaked
[4:19:22] <+duskrush> stealth jams your radar
[4:19:25] <dreadedcthulhu> radar jammed

[4:26:51] <+THE_CYB3R_FOX> You should try invasion someday time Spartans bs elites
[4:26:53] <Yummy_Nukes> would've been better if your team didn't have people drop out
[4:26:55] <%biggdaddymike> That's halo till 2 weeks since ODST is coming out

[4:27:28] <%AceOne5> Good kills V
[4:27:28] <Artoo_The_Me> Dirty blues
[4:27:31] <+Grayhammatter> not bad
[4:27:33] <%derap41> You weren't being Stream Snipped like Woolie
[4:27:33] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus I'd say Halo Salt Party but it's not a game Woolie knows he can beat Minh and Reggie in Kappa
[4:27:35] <dinnydanny777> Woolie didn't even get to teabag somebody
[4:27:36] <cipher758> that was a halo
[4:27:38] <%averyoddjew> eh who's counting
[4:27:40] <%RioGascar> not exactly cause controller gets aim assist
[4:27:42] <Mr_Strut> Or you could just use a mouse
[4:27:43] <%Tearonex> @WoolieVersus that was way better than expected gg
[4:27:43] <Torivore> When the Halo Wars 2 map logs read-through stream
[4:27:44] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Controller is easier in MCC lmao
[4:27:51] <+THE_CYB3R_FOX> You guys did good for being down 3 guys
[4:27:51] <Ignorableartist> Thats what happens when you talk shit about the Plasma pistol
[4:27:55] <%Zebroneath> Despite that skill gap, you did A-okay
[4:27:56] <zashrin777> @WoolieVersus People joining sessions en masses to find you actually caused other games to have mass team quits. lol The player base is confused.
[4:27:58] <%RyTYoung> Controller is no excuse, you gotta fight the mouse and keyboard users!
[4:28:05] <+mechslayer71> Controller isn’t really a disadvantage in this game
[4:28:12] <@Solidus_113> surrender only works in turn based games
[4:28:18] <+MrBaldachin> matches don't go long enough usually to need a surrender as well
[4:28:18] <%DatAsuna> rage quit is also to proect your W:L
[4:28:20] <%derap41> @mechslayer71 Keep telling yourself that
[4:28:25] <%AceOne5> @Solidus_113 so true
[4:28:31] <%FenixSeraph> SPEEEN

[4:30:48] <%derap41> in the butt
[4:30:51] <dinnydanny777> A game where you play as a Covenant throughout could be fun
[4:31:00] <TheChucklingOak> No it's good tho! Sure I read it like 2 or 3 years ago, but I'm sure it's good!
[4:31:01] <%derap41> his butt is called the ship
[4:31:07] <%GeneralSCPatton> I love the first 3 books for nostalgia, barely remember the next 3. Never touched the others.
[4:31:11] <Yummy_Nukes> to be fair, in reach tea bagging makes your spartan's butt jiggle

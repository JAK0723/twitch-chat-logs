[0:22:18] <soulkarl> howdy
[0:22:20] <PeachSaliva> @zaver88 I‚Äôll never stop.
[0:22:23] <Captain_Joe1911> notekMilk CurseLit
[0:22:38] <Cogito1001> Woolie does not look at chat, I think hes better off for it though
[0:22:39] <voyagerwitch> the woolie versus show has to have its own associated niche fetish. my vote is edging
[0:22:44] <Tatoofrei> green
[0:22:46] <PEShDotEXE> parry the grenade balls
[0:22:52] <umbypokochan> am i the only one that wants woolie to face the other way?
[0:22:53] <lloyddboy> ALL IN ON RED
[0:22:59] <+Zaver88> But what if you finally get them?
[0:23:01] <+TheOmniGeek> Hello Woolie, hello Chat!
[0:23:05] <+Zaver88> What if you achieve your goal?
[0:23:05] <Prevot> Woolie VS Feet
[0:23:07] <umbypokochan> he should be angled towards kirby
[0:23:08] <heatrashes> no seeing kirby looming in the corner is nice
[0:23:09] <lloyddboy> Keep that L
[0:23:12] <yuribo26> Yours is better
[0:23:13] <+binkarus> he's still early. learning to read chat and play is a skill that needs practice
[0:23:14] <Captain_Joe1911> hi @TheOmniGeek :)
[0:23:14] <Tatoofrei> keep yours
[0:23:19] <LtThunderbolt> P A R R Y
[0:23:23] <+heckyell> woolie vs vore
[0:23:25] <GohanEgret> see what i mean
[0:23:26] <+Skatedeandre> hes still green on streaming
[0:23:28] <edward11231> 2 streams in and we got fetishy BS, that‚Äôs gotta be a record
[0:23:32] <+theKittenhugs> Woolie vs. indecision
[0:23:33] <KiraKamixephos> Recycle
[0:23:34] <lloyddboy> SELL IT
[0:23:38] <waterstealer> perry
[0:23:40] <+TheOmniGeek> Woolie's couch looks super comf
[0:23:40] <RenzoTheLion> recycle shit you don't pick uo you madman
[0:23:41] <waterstealer> mason
[0:23:42] <+TehPryceIsRight> Hitting those background bells in order of tone took me FOREVER to figure out.
[0:23:43] <+mstrswrd> if you just hit rb, it'll put you in a comparison screen. You can back out afterwords, instead of pausing over and over
[0:23:45] <yuribo26> @edward11231 we actually got fetish shit on the debut stream
[0:23:45] <gigiaten> Woolie VS Feet
[0:23:46] <ofalconer> This is one of the best loadouts I've seen
[0:23:53] <FatDragonQuest> I think my only personal gripe with this game can also be directed at dark souls where I wish every weapon in this game was good
[0:23:57] <Tampaoster> CRAZY TALK like pat?
[0:23:57] <lloyddboy> I CAN'T BELIEVE WOOLIE HATES THE ENVIRONMENT
[0:24:07] <Nohorse> And animals too

[0:24:17] <+Eaglestrike117> Wooile how many gifs fo you have for follows my man, this is insanly hype
[0:24:17] <hntronium> Woolie, do you litter while you jaywalk
[0:24:17] <FatDragonQuest> I'm mostly saying it because I just wish the whips were better they're my favorite ;_;
[0:24:20] <Doctor_Death_Bed> I can't believe Woolie hates fighting games
[0:24:22] <Doctor_Death_Bed> who knew
[0:24:27] <Aris_throttle> ive never gotten beyond the area after the clocktower. shit's nuts
[0:24:28] <nolifegamin> @FatDragonQuest eh, having the not good weapons makes the good weapons looks REAL good
[0:24:38] <+binkarus> svennoss streams fortnite and is a god of reading chats and playing, even in an fps. it's a high skill cap ability
[0:24:40] <+VanaSkiller> bots not ready I see
[0:24:42] <+Skatedeandre> not every weapon can be good
[0:24:46] <crimsonharvest> whats that gun, a gradius / vic viper reference?
[0:24:50] <Nohorse> The game seems a little easier once you get the fucking MACHINEGUN
[0:24:53] <Stebdavee> My build is always: Repeating crossbow, 2 turrets, support, efficiency, and extra arrows.
[0:24:54] <deviljhojho94> i love you woolie
[0:24:55] <mandragoraroot> woolies been streaming for 25 minutes

[0:37:00] <~WoolieVersus> ---- @Solidnick18 has become Captain Chicken! They can type "heal", "potion", "life" to heal the hero, "noheal" to reject a healing request or "resign" to chicken... out... of being Captain Chicken. Last but not least, they can write "@woolieversus" before their messages in chat to make Captain Chicken speak in-game!

[0:49:35] <~WoolieVersus> ---- @Wool has been named Captain Chicken for this level!
[0:49:35] <~WoolieVersus> ---- @Wool has become Captain Chicken! They can type "heal", "potion", "life" to heal the hero, "noheal" to reject a healing request or "resign" to chicken... out... of being Captain Chicken. Last but not least, they can write "@woolieversus" before their messages in chat to make Captain Chicken speak in-game!

They can type "heal", "potion", "life" to heal the hero, "noheal" to reject a healing request or "resign" to chicken... out... of being Captain Chicken. Last but not least, they can write "@woolieversus" before their messages in chat to make Captain Chicken speak in-game!

[2:43:15] <+aboveUp> God, the hot/cold music gimmick of stage 3 is perfect
[2:43:19] <SafetyBet> Vanilla is my personal favorite
[2:43:20] <Aussie_Manny> You can dance, if you want to.
[2:43:21] <damienlunas> Change all the tracks to Haruka Kanata
[2:43:22] <MagumaDono> and I love rhythm based gameplay
[2:43:28] <SafetyBet> But Jake sounds good @WoolieVersus
[2:43:44] <+revrendike> golden lute, gold and loot, or golden loot?

[2:44:14] <Aussie_Manny> Well obviously.
[2:44:14] <+Recthel> patapon 4 never FeelsBadMan
[2:44:19] <MagumaDono> I used to Play mvc2 while listening to tracks and tried running my combos to beats
[2:44:27] <PsychoFlash1> What's your favorite roguelike? @WoolieVersus
[2:44:28] <SafetyBet> @Recthel Oh wow
[2:44:28] <MagumaDono> I downloaded Beat Boxers!!! I like that idea
[2:44:46] <+purps26> woolie you are a little quiet
[2:44:49] <G_Lancaster> Woolie have you ever checked out Neon Drive? It's a 80's synth style driving rhythm game with an amazing ost. @WoolieVersus
[2:44:50] <sleepybalrog> woolie stream D:
[2:44:52] <Aussie_Manny> I like Hero's Come Back, bruh.
[2:44:55] <damienlunas> @WoolieVersus have you ever played Mother 3? That game has rhythm based gameplay for its attacks.
[2:44:59] <WaxWitch> did they fix the frame issues?
[2:45:08] <+Menitta> Is there a rhythm fighter? Besides Slap Happy?
[2:45:10] <thehollow89> Audiosurf got me through 200 hours of my music backlog
[2:45:11] <kaine_west> Woolie do you still listen to rap? stuff like Kendrick or Earl Sweatshirt. the modern stuff
[2:45:13] <yuribo26> RHYTMN + TEXT ADVENTURE PogChamp
[2:45:14] <Galacta_Pieta> On top of that just being able to add custom music to these games just adds a ton of replay-ability to it
[2:45:17] <PsychoFlash1> @Aussie_Manny hero's come back is fucking sick
[2:45:20] <+EndgameContent> I actually made a rhythm-based canoe racer in college, oddly enough
[2:45:24] <MagumaDono> I feel that for sure.
[2:45:33] <+EndgameContent> Rhythm-based stuff is super straightforward to implement in UE4
[2:45:43] <Aussie_Manny> !sr Hero's Come Back
[2:45:44] <+revrendike> So when ya gonna play Just Shapes and Beats by Berzerk Studios?
[2:46:00] <+runethomas> Rhythm based fighter?
[2:46:10] <sleepybalrog> like wind waker?
[2:46:21] <+EndgameContent> Mother 3's got some pretty neat rhythm-based gameplay for an RPG
[2:46:32] <MagumaDono> LMAO
[2:46:38] <MagumaDono> OHHH THATS TEMPTING
[2:46:38] <+Menitta> Did Moether 3 ever come out? Kappa
[2:46:41] <+EndgameContent> Especially with how the beats get harder to follow later in the game
[2:46:43] <MagumaDono> DDR pad gaming
[2:46:52] <TheClashAtDemonhead> before the echo is a rhythm rpg and is real great
[2:46:56] <+EndgameContent> You can download the Japanese ROM and apply an English patch to it
[2:47:03] <yuribo26> I didn't laugh, FUND IT sbfpYeyeye
[2:47:08] <+MarioHead3> Rhythm VN, someone do it
[2:47:10] <rararasputino> Typing of the dead style could wor
[2:47:11] <WaxWitch> Rythem based fps
[2:47:11] <+EndgameContent> I really recommend playing it, it still holds up
[2:47:15] <damienlunas> You gotta type on the beat
[2:47:20] <yuribo26> Rhythm VN PogChamp
[2:47:22] <Aussie_Manny> I want a rhythm RPG. Like Super Mario RPG's button mash moments, but not as annoying.
[2:47:28] <damienlunas> m e l t w i z a r d
[2:47:30] <+Menitta> @WoolieVersus Is there a rhythm fighting game besides like Slap Happy Rhythm Busters? Granted that's moreso the supers, right?

[2:49:15] <MagumaDono> When we goin' to the Lab to play Big Band @WoolieVersus ?
[2:49:18] <Galacta_Pieta> I could imagine a fps where the bullets are loaded and fired in beat with the music, unless that exists
[2:49:23] <+Recthel> funky fresh beats
[2:49:24] <reonome> woolie pls lower game volume
[2:49:32] <kaine_west> it counts, shit slaps
[2:49:34] <yuribo26> The music affects gameplay making it HYPE
[2:49:36] <damienlunas> You can't listen to Funky Fresh Beats and NOT have it affect your gameplay
[2:49:37] <CloudCircus> Did Woolie wake up in garbage today?
[2:49:40] <SomersaultJustice> Mother 3 had a beat based thing to do more damage on attacks
[2:49:41] <startstoprepeat> so was david cage years ahead of his time with the rhythm based sex scene in indigo prophecy

[2:58:58] <+eldritchbee> You're painfully bad wools
[2:59:03] <+astropyrus> But killing the shopkeeper would mean no vocals and thats true evil
[2:59:05] <yuribo26> When does easy mode gets unlocked?
[2:59:13] <+runethomas> Getgud
[2:59:20] <+eldritchbee> >doesnt have the dlc

[2:59:41] <kaine_west> the french is getting in your head
[2:59:47] <Aussie_Manny> Rouge the Bait.
[2:59:48] <denam_of_windscale> *takes L for spelling*
[2:59:53] <+astropyrus> Roguelike The bat
[2:59:55] <craig_t> @woolieversus octavia's power is a rythym game aura, where you and the other players get buffs (invisibility, extra damage, etc) for performing specific actions (attacking, jumping, ducking, using powers) on the beat. Players get to make their own beats with a litlle in game MIDI maker, so people either have super optimized hell tracks or covers of megalovania or guile's stage or whatnot
[2:59:56] <yuribo26> Hitting the lab PogChamp
[2:59:56] <SafetyBet> LUL
[2:59:56] <yukichocomilk> lab time PogChamp
[3:00:05] <+NiktenKing> Rouge like? Is that a Plague reference?
[3:00:16] <official_nakmatic> Is this a Rhythm dungeon crawler? GivePLZ
[3:00:29] <yuribo26> Where can I check the frame data? evoFlip evoStick
[3:00:30] <+astropyrus> @official_nakmatic Rhythm based Rogue lite dungeon crawler, ye
[3:00:47] <kaine_west> this game is sick can't believe you can lab enemies
[3:00:48] <Aussie_Manny> Slay the goblins.
[3:00:52] <denam_of_windscale> @NiktenKing lol no it's me fucking up because im distracted by martial masters
[3:01:04] <yuribo26> M I D I
[3:01:24] <official_nakmatic> @denam_of_windscale People know about that game?
[3:01:39] <denam_of_windscale> @official_nakmatic I fuckin do
[3:01:51] <+LethargicRush> I think the best octavia track i heard was Another one bites the dust
[3:01:54] <yuribo26> LEARNED THE MATCH UP evoGG evoGG evoGG
[3:02:13] <+eldritchbee> @WoolieVersus You should get the dlc, it adds a lot more to everything
[3:02:19] <kaine_west> DMC giving ya brainworms
[3:02:19] <+Menitta> The more I look at this game, the harder it seems to play.
[3:02:22] <SafetyBet> Even the training music is good, Fuck
[3:02:23] <+Hilleltaco> Yeah but multiplier gets you that gold tho
[3:02:27] <SafetyBet> This game man
[3:02:27] <yuribo26> @Menitta its super hard
[3:02:33] <Aussie_Manny> Use the Hylian Shield.
[3:02:40] <+MarioHead3> @Menitta It's hard but it gets easier the more you play
[3:02:42] <+Hilleltaco> I guess health is more valuable than gold in the short temr
[3:02:47] <+Hilleltaco> *term
[3:02:47] <+eldritchbee> @WoolieVersus also NEVER stop moving, just dig into the walls if you need something to get closer to you
[3:02:51] <NonAddictiveSlurm> @yuribo26 its weird to play more like
[3:02:51] <GreatestGuess> Standing still when you could be dancing WutFace
[3:02:51] <+astropyrus> Living > Gold
[3:03:02] <+Menitta> I bet it'd be easier for me since I have a music background '
[3:03:06] <Talz_> You really need to keep your multiplier going in this game. You won't make any gold otherwise.
[3:03:09] <RubyPilot> god i hate those box things so much
[3:03:09] <Aussie_Manny> Is that a snow goron?
[3:03:13] <GoldeNOVA> @WoolieVersus Ever checked out Osu!? It's a fully customizable rhythm game.
[3:03:19] <craig_t> i just realized that with octavia and the fortuna update for warframe, i can now run around warframe like a kid on skateboard with a jukebox
[3:03:25] <kaine_west> Osu that game owns
[3:03:28] <RubyPilot> THOSE BOX T HINGS ARE THE WORST
[3:03:36] <SafetyBet> It's ok man, just get in there @WoolieVersus
[3:03:38] <+runethomas> I love Osu, but everyone just using a tablet and pen
[3:03:45] <SafetyBet> Don't panic when you get it
[3:03:51] <GoldeNOVA> I played Osu in the Taiko mode, it's fun
[3:03:51] <RubyPilot> bad damag
[3:04:01] <gustavozxd> I only play keyboard OSU
[3:04:02] <yuribo26> Just lame it out
[3:04:03] <RubyPilot> [northernlion voice] BAD DAMAGE
[3:04:15] <Galacta_Pieta> just don't get hit ever, then you'll win for sure Kappa
[3:04:16] <+barkon345> is there no way to subscribe?
[3:04:17] <gustavozxd> but honestly I kinda got bored with all the anime/hentai songs
[3:04:24] <+eldritchbee> @WoolieVersus All Zones Mode is great for practicing
[3:04:35] <+astropyrus> For real, I love playing osu!mania but im getting sick of only anime opening songs for the most part
[3:04:48] <+koidev> @barkon345 not yet, waiting for Woolie's waiting for Twitch to set him up with it
[3:05:00] <+Recthel> @astropyrus lunatic rave 2 my dude
[3:05:02] <yuribo26> @astropyrus fucking weebs DansGame
[3:05:02] <SafetyBet> Never played Osu
[3:05:06] <gustavozxd> like hey I wanna get back to osu let's get some Michael Jackson songs in, nothing, I guess there's the non ranked stuff but idk...
[3:05:06] <damienlunas> Man, I wish we could get a Best Friends x Northernlion crossover already. Even if it's just them talking about hockey for 3 hours.
[3:05:06] <GoldeNOVA> @WoolieVersus You don't like the other characters?
[3:05:13] <SafetyBet> Is that something like this game
[3:05:18] <kaine_west> sacrifice style
[3:05:21] <craig_t> @woolieversus if you beat dark souls with a guitar hero controller, does that make it a rythym game? ;p
[3:05:31] <yuribo26> @GoldeNOVA he likes default better
[3:05:45] <yuribo26> WutFace
[3:05:51] <yuribo26> I legit got scared
[3:05:55] <+runethomas> sbfpGreen
[3:05:57] <Galacta_Pieta> also other characters you can play as change the ways you interact with the beat
[3:05:58] <yuribo26> Because I didn't knew it was in game
[3:05:58] <gustavozxd> I thought that scream was in here
[3:06:11] <yuribo26> @gustavozxd same dude
[3:06:13] <+eldritchbee> rockGrub
[3:06:21] <reonome> HEAL
[3:06:26] <yuka34> gabyLul
[3:06:35] <Tampaoster> how do you play it with only one hand?
[3:06:56] <+eldritchbee> @WoolieVersus Fun fact! Killing the fire cauldrons ups your multiplier, same with the mushrooms! rockGrub rockGrub rockGrub
[3:06:59] <+koidev> @WoolieVersus Or Initial T
[3:07:00] <+Menitta> I saw a guy play Blazblue with a Project Diva controller so anything is possible
[3:07:01] <+clack14> the right is doing so much work Kreygasm
[3:07:03] <yuribo26> @Tampaoster game only has 4 inputs
[3:07:04] <+astropyrus> @Tampaoster Only need the directions
[3:07:05] <+Hilleltaco> @Tampaoster It's all on directions
[3:07:08] <SafetyBet> They all are good
[3:07:10] <SafetyBet> LUL
[3:07:11] <+Shotgundam009> SourPls
[3:07:12] <+Hilleltaco> You could play this with a DDR pad
[3:07:14] <kaine_west> KonCha
[3:07:20] <Tampaoster> got it thx
[3:07:27] <+Menitta> You can't play SMash bros with a DDR pad, it sucks
[3:07:38] <+Shotgundam009> or can you
[3:07:38] <+MarioHead3> There was that one guy who plays GG with a steering wheel
[3:07:43] <Talz_> @WoolieVersus There's a character called Bard that lets you play without needing to worry about being on-beat. Good for practice, but the downside is you lose the awesome music.
[3:07:45] <yuribo26> @MarioHead3 LUL
[3:07:46] <+NiktenKing> LUL
[3:07:52] <SixthSun2> LUL
[3:07:55] <RubyPilot> fuck shovemonster
[3:08:00] <+clack14> I got a big clock
[3:08:02] <GoldeNOVA> I love the free bomb stuff in Isaac
[3:08:19] <SafetyBet> Bard sucks
[3:08:23] <SafetyBet> It's confusing
[3:08:41] <GreatestGuess> That guy made top 8 at a major with a steering wheel
[3:09:05] <+clack14> yeah but he doesn't turn the wheel he just uses the d-pad like it's a normal pad
[3:09:09] <Tampaoster> @WoolieVersus show us the characters when you return to the level select screen
[3:09:11] <SafetyBet> Shake that booty fire lady PogChamp
[3:09:15] <MagumaDono> All dem biggy bois
[3:09:18] <SixthSun2> big assholes Kreygasm
[3:09:19] <+clack14> so imagine a d-pad that has a wheel on it
[3:09:39] <gustavozxd> sometimes i find myself just navigating menus in the rhythm of the song that's playing LUL
[3:10:06] <reonome> FEET
[3:10:11] <MagumaDono> I love this ice mechanic
[3:10:11] <+astropyrus> @WoolieVersus If you wanna keep the multiplier more, remember that most of the time you can just move back and forth, to sync up with what the monster patterns are
[3:10:13] <MagumaDono> it's super cute!
[3:10:42] <craig_t> i'm trying to wash dishes to the beat........this probably is not a good idea
[3:10:43] <+Floofiie> RUNNING OTU FO TIME

[3:11:27] <+MarioHead3> The bars turn red when it's near the end of the song
[3:11:31] <+Menitta> Ah ok
[3:11:40] <+astropyrus> Its 2ish minutes for most stages I think
[3:11:49] <yuka34> like 3 minutes
[3:11:55] <+eldritchbee> NOOOOO
[3:12:04] <damienlunas> AT WHAT COST
[3:12:10] <+eldritchbee> Woolie that was SO not good
[3:12:25] <+Menitta> How is the Switch version of Necrodancer?
[3:12:26] <+runethomas> Ouch

[3:12:36] <MagumaDono> That dragon chose Fight instead of Flight
[3:12:43] <+MarioHead3> @Menitta Good from what I played
[3:12:49] <+eldritchbee> ALWAYS go damage over health

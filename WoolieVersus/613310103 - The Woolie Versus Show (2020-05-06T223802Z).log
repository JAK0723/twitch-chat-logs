[0:00:05] <%wunp_fxs> adn we back
[0:00:07] <%Gruhunchously> @ch3ggy As someone who only played OG Fallout a few years ago, I would absolutely recommend it, with some qualifications.
[0:00:08] <lotharrio> As an example, discovering how overpowered Teddy Bears in Earthbound are, is what made me willing to play the game repeatedly.
[0:00:15] <+tearknack> yeah
[0:00:23] <CursedNobleman> @lotharrio how do you mean?
[0:00:29] <ch3ggy> PogChamp
[0:00:41] <ch3ggy> but yeah from what i've heard you can like talk your way out of any combat right?
[0:00:53] <ch3ggy> i generally play a game with high char/int stats
[0:00:56] <+tearknack> oh yeah, crpg is also a term sued to refer to more modern games like divinity original sin and pillars of eternity, des[ite them not being based on a ttrpg like all the old dnd based games
[0:01:05] <CursedNobleman> not quite. there are random encounters and maybe a couple forced fights
[0:01:05] <%Gruhunchously> Not all combat.
[0:01:05] <+tearknack> @ch3ggy pretty much
[0:01:09] <+tearknack> but not all
[0:01:20] <coffeeabomination> Is V back? And healthy?
[0:01:20] <+tearknack> you cna't tlak you way out of like, a fight with random rats
[0:01:23] <jackelzxaa> What LP is it
[0:01:24] <+tearknack> thery're rats
[0:01:30] <+tearknack> @jackelzxaa read
[0:01:32] <ch3ggy> haha
[0:01:33] <%Gruhunchously> But most random encounters you can run away from if you can't or don't want to fight.
[0:01:37] <lotharrio> So, in case you don't know: In EB, you have very limited inventory. Something like 16 slots for equipment+items on each character. The game is constantly throwing healing items at you in the form of food. But using that in combat takes up a turn and even good, late game items will only heal you 70-150 HP.
[0:01:49] <+tearknack> EB?
[0:01:50] <jackelzxaa> @tearknack its blank on my phone
[0:01:50] <correctedsun117> More Store Wars?
[0:01:54] <+tearknack> earthbound
[0:01:54] <lotharrio> Earthbound.
[0:01:59] <+tearknack> took a sec lol
[0:02:08] <+tearknack> @jackelzxaa ah. its kotor 2
[0:02:10] <ch3ggy> this music pretty sweet
[0:02:16] <+tearknack> hmm
[0:02:26] <+tearknack> i kind of want to go back and try nwn and nwn 2
[0:02:29] <lotharrio> But starting the second town, you can start buying Teddy Bears, which are an item that has something like a 3/4 chance to taking a hit for you, and has its own HP track of... something like 100 HP.
[0:02:38] <ch3ggy> and yeah they bout to get to Onderon btw, just finished up all the stuff on Dxun
[0:02:46] <%eyezehuhh> we back
[0:02:46] <%Reverend_Roscoe> HERE WE GO
[0:02:54] <+tearknack> i've repalyed balldurs gate, icewind dale, i've played planescape torment a bunch, i've played more modern crpgs
[0:03:01] <CursedNobleman> @tearknack egggh, MMO style combat in NWN1
[0:03:02] <%BisoromiBear> WHAT
[0:03:05] <%eyezehuhh> t101LETS t101DO t101THIS
[0:03:10] <+tearknack> but ive never went back and repalyed the 3.x era games
[0:03:19] <vulkan_vibes> *AKIHIKO VOICE* I've been waiting for this.
[0:03:19] <jackelzxaa> Isnt there a mystery LP this week starting!
[0:03:20] <ashenjuan25> woolieMIRIN woolieMIRIN woolieMIRIN woolieMIRIN woolieMIRIN
[0:03:21] <+tearknack> did i even paly them?
[0:03:23] <BallerSwagBro9k> BACK INTO THE BREAC
[0:03:25] <CursedNobleman> @lotharrio what makes em cheap tho?
[0:03:26] <+tearknack> i honestly cant remember
[0:03:29] <BallerSwagBro9k> NEW SHIT PogChamp
[0:03:33] <Klefth> MANDO TIME
[0:03:36] <lotharrio> So it's ablative HP, extending your survival just like healing items, but with more HP, without taking a turn to use them. Plus they can tank status effects for you, giving you a flat 3/4s chance to ignore them.
[0:03:37] <+tearknack> @jackelzxaa they did streets of rage 4 as a one off
[0:03:42] <%eyezehuhh> t101YAM t101ERO woolieOMG
[0:04:00] <BallerSwagBro9k> Never mind that shit HERE COMES MANDO
[0:04:02] <CursedNobleman> @lotharrio can you carry multiple, i forget
[0:04:03] <+tearknack> what mix is this again
[0:04:06] <actuallyvuulviie> So did Little V cash in his N Pass Premium yet?
[0:04:07] <CaptHat211> Hello, strangers
[0:04:13] <+tearknack> sorry, i'm too white, i don't know the rappers name
[0:04:15] <CursedNobleman> well, i guess theres the escargo express anyhow
[0:04:18] <Klefth> @eyezehuhh Dang, that would've been perfect for the end of Nalt
[0:04:18] <lotharrio> And you can fill your inventory with them, turning your MC who has maybe 120 HP, into a tank with about 900+ effective HP.
[0:04:27] <CursedNobleman> LUL
[0:04:35] <lotharrio> Even if they are destroyed taking the hit, they still absorb ALL of that hit.
[0:04:47] <CursedNobleman> the thing i remember most from earthbound is the inventory management. you really feel like you dont have enough slots LUL
[0:04:48] <lotharrio> And right when they stop being effective, a better version is rolled out.
[0:04:53] <%eyezehuhh> @klefth got blessed with a gift sub too late
[0:04:59] <BallerSwagBro9k> SourPls NEW SHIT SourPls
[0:05:04] <lotharrio> Yeah, the inventory management is the biggest struggle.
[0:05:05] <jackelzxaa> Probably too soon to anticipate half life 2....
[0:05:07] <CursedNobleman> i mean, the gift boxes are crap anyhow, but still, not many slots
[0:05:20] <%Struggleful> Yay a stream for us working people!
[0:05:24] <%Gruhunchously> Are we allowed to listen to this without an N-Pass?
[0:05:26] <lotharrio> But the majority of items are healing shit, and fuck that. Acquire Teddy Bears.
[0:05:29] <CursedNobleman> riiiight. working... people...
[0:05:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> @lotharrio What item and game are you talking about?
[0:05:43] <%eyezehuhh> @gruhunchously what they gone do?
[0:05:43] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:05:44] <lotharrio> Earthbound, Teddy Bears and then Deluxe Bears.
[0:05:49] <+tearknack> @GeneralSCPatton Earthbound
[0:06:05] <+tearknack> the current song is [Tengen Toppa Getten Crunkann (Lil Jon x Gurren Lagann]
[0:06:15] <+Grayhammatter> SourPls
[0:06:28] <lotharrio> If a hit gets through? MC has healing and status cures. Since you are taking less damage, he can be more free with using them.
[0:06:29] <+tearknack> the current song is....uh.....some udnertale mix, i don't know
[0:06:41] <%GeneralSCPatton> YEYEYE psaBig ASRIEL FEELS!
[0:07:02] <lotharrio> After learning about Teddy Bears, I found out how Busted Jeff is, and how he makes the other two characters, Paula and Poo into solid contributors to random fights instead of being nukes you hold back for bosses.
[0:07:16] <ashenjuan25> Anyone play them fallen order challenges?
[0:07:24] <+tearknack> i
[0:07:30] <+tearknack> ll play fallen order at some point
[0:07:35] <CrmznOgre> AH SHIT TIME TO GET MY FIX
[0:07:37] <+tearknack> i jsut find the MC so boring to look at
[0:07:39] <CursedNobleman> what do you enjoy about replaying earthbound?
[0:07:46] <+tearknack> he's succh a piece of plain white bread
[0:07:55] <+Grayhammatter> oh yeah, jeff with his bottle rockets are busted
[0:08:11] <Doodle_Taco> yeyeyeyeyeyeye
[0:08:12] <ashenjuan25> Yeah it’s kinda generic Star Wars but idk maybe it’s just me I find the hard difficulty kind of busted to a degree and could use some work
[0:08:13] <lotharrio> At this point it's mostly nostalgia, but I do still dig the writing, art style and music.
[0:08:14] <BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYEY
[0:08:14] <%Gruhunchously> Whaaaaa....

[0:08:46] <lotharrio> Plus, I'm the sort of asshole who wants to try and get the best possible solution to a fight, so planning around enemy shields is a big thing for me for dumb reasons.

[0:11:13] <%DatAsuna> People beg for lucas back, but HE THREW IT OUT
[0:11:21] <+slamzalid> Welcome Back Again Dudes!! :D <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
[0:11:29] <+tearknack> its not confusing?
[0:11:32] <lotharrio> Legends is old EU.
[0:11:34] <+tearknack> eu = legends
[0:11:41] <+SolidusRex> Knights of the Old EU
[0:11:46] <CaptHat211> TBF Lucas was under the impression that they'd follow an outline he provided instead of NO OUTLINE AT ALL.
[0:11:48] <+tearknack> its just a new name
[0:11:53] <%DatAsuna> @tearknack there's a new EU tho
[0:12:05] <haitakaa> but rebels doe
[0:12:07] <%eyezehuhh> psaCrazyhead
[0:12:08] <+tearknack> @DatAsuna ah, fair
[0:12:10] <%xcompleasedad> The most right anyone has ever been.
[0:12:12] <+SolidusRex> Bad Batch was good though
[0:12:14] <%DatAsuna> also tbf saying it has filler doesn't mean the filler is bad
[0:12:15] <%Jetzord> I dunno man, the first four episodes were good
[0:12:16] <+zanzibar_junker> People are calling FF7R2 the next Endgame, fuck that noise
[0:12:18] <%DatAsuna> SOME of the filler is good
[0:12:19] <+Grayhammatter> paunching
[0:12:21] <+tearknack> Gendy clone wars is the only one i've seen
[0:12:24] <%Gruhunchously> pouching
[0:12:27] <%Pillagius> To be doubly fair it's same as Ridley Scott wasn't the only one who made the Alien movies so awesome - Geourge Lucas wasn't the only one who made Star Wars so awesome as well
[0:12:30] <%DatAsuna> FF7's best chapter is filler
[0:12:32] <haitakaa> that Mace Window fight
[0:12:54] <%Slimshazbot> Gendy Wars was soooo goooooooood
[0:12:54] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1257528186524622851
[0:12:58] <%Pillagius> Like Lucas isn't singlehandedly responsible for franchise greatness
[0:12:59] <availablethor> Mace Window lol
[0:13:02] <CaptHat211> Gendy's Star Wars was pretty good, but the Jedi were too OP. General Grievous was great though.
[0:13:09] <+tearknack> @zanzibar_junker i am so sick of the MCU and its idiot normie fans, fucking god
[0:13:11] <ashenjuan25> Gendy grevious isn’t best grevious
[0:13:12] <%Gruhunchously> General Grevous is like the friggin' Terminator in that show
[0:13:14] <ashenjuan25> Is*
[0:13:16] <Dangerzone979> Is the audio super low for anyone else?
[0:13:21] <+zanzibar_junker> I hate mcu

[0:13:35] <+Invlux> @pillagius it's almost as if people don't get that movies are a collaborative effort and can't be only attributed to a single person
[0:13:42] <%DatAsuna> tbf the movie is also the worst part
[0:13:43] <+oda_flobunaga> Naruto>Clone Wars?
[0:13:43] <%Gruhunchously> Akshuly
[0:13:44] <+tearknack> @zanzibar_junker i like thor ragnarok, black panther, and Iron Man 1 and 2
[0:13:51] <+Grayhammatter> the movie was pretty bad
[0:13:54] <ashenjuan25> Trash > naruto
[0:13:58] <lotharrio> Lucas was like... only about 30% of what made Star Wars good. And half of that is stuff he took from Spaghetti Westerns and Japanese samurai films.
[0:13:59] <CaptHat211> Dave Filoni salvaged the world of the Prequels which I thought was impossible.
[0:14:00] <+prime_name> That movie was the worst sell for the show.
[0:14:08] <+oda_flobunaga> Trash>Naruto>Clone Wars?
[0:14:08] <liljojofett> THAT WAS THE WRONG READ
[0:14:10] <haitakaa> Yoda vs count deku was cool
[0:14:10] <%xcompleasedad> The movie was that stupid shit where the pilot for a show is a dumb movie.
[0:14:22] <+tearknack> fact of the day, Gendy Ttartovsky did storyboarding for Iron Man 1 and 2
[0:14:22] <%DatAsuna> @CaptHat211 there was a lot of good legends prequels era too

[0:34:10] <lotharrio> Misconception, @oda_flobunaga The original didn't include Boba, unless I'm entirely incorrect.

[0:44:05] <%TheFabledAble> The initial attempts were a red herring to goad Canderous into thinking he could jab back, and then when she had him believing they were on equal footing Kreia came in with the fuckin leg sweep and planted him on his ass
[0:44:06] <%Grayhammatter> woolieGIRLS
[0:44:14] <lotharrio> psaBig VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea
[0:44:18] <ValberParadox> You haven't made Mira a Jedi yet?
[0:44:28] <ashenjuan25> LUL
[0:44:38] <+oda_flobunaga> nobody cares about Mira
[0:44:39] <ashenjuan25> Fuck Mira
[0:44:47] <%emperordread> color co-ordination is canon
[0:44:51] <%DatAsuna> Well the canon is blue, but fuck that
[0:44:53] <%DatAsuna> blue is overused
[0:44:58] <zocano> Mira is staying on the ship
[0:44:59] <thequickbrownrabbit> mira who all i hear is not hanhar
[0:45:04] <DSD24> Oh we rolling with the ladies?
[0:45:16] <+Invlux> LET THEM PUNCH
[0:45:24] <CaptHat211> I first saw Force Punching in Gendy's CW series.
[0:45:28] <%RioGascar> i still dont get why people use silver colored sabers
[0:45:28] <ashenjuan25> Mira will never leave that room
[0:45:32] <%hoenhime344> let them use Silat
[0:45:36] <lotharrio> @ValberParadox Probably either waiting for her so she's a good Gun-Jedi, or not bothering with her at all.
[0:45:39] <%hoenhime344> punchy kicky time
[0:45:44] <%DatAsuna> Should have someone with each
[0:46:04] <%RioGascar> Cause if I remember the lore in silver lightsabers is an unstable crystal that was created from losing a loved one or something crazy
[0:46:09] <%Grayhammatter> Vsauce
[0:46:10] <ValberParadox> LUL why the Mira hate?
[0:46:22] <zocano> Cause Mira is ResidentSleeper
[0:46:32] <%Gruhunchously> Visas is really easy to influence.
[0:46:33] <lotharrio> @ValberParadox Didn't like her intro or her attitude in conversations.
[0:46:36] <%hoenhime344> Mira is a jobber
[0:46:36] <ashenjuan25> Mira is woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:46:37] <+oda_flobunaga> Hanhar is Best Waifu
[0:46:39] <%RioGascar> Tho it might be legends now so might not matter at all
[0:46:40] <thequickbrownrabbit> fann walks into a room full of sith When will you learn your actions have consequences!!!
[0:46:41] <Daxalog> I thought the stream ended
[0:46:52] <lotharrio> There's a bit to go with Visas, but you max out influence with her almost instantly just with conversations.
[0:46:55] <%NocturnGamma> You there was some Uchiha force user that needed a silver crystal lol
[0:46:57] <%DatAsuna> @Daxalog just a food break
[0:47:00] <ValberParadox> @RioGascar When you purify a red crystal (which is a corrupted crystal) it becomes silver, that what Ahsoka did.
[0:47:12] <%Grayhammatter> punchy kicks
[0:47:26] <+tearknack> hmm
[0:47:33] <%RioGascar> when did she do this? Since we kinda just see that saber get pulled out
[0:47:33] <lotharrio> Force Attacks are armor proof.
[0:47:37] <+tearknack> i guess i like the new red crystal lore
[0:47:41] <ashenjuan25> I hate how crystals have to be tortured for a red lightsaber
[0:47:42] <+tearknack> its pretty edgy
[0:47:50] <+tearknack> eh, i think its fun
[0:47:51] <%RioGascar> also clone wars s7 really fucking good last 4 episodes
[0:48:01] <%NocturnGamma> Is that canon yet?
[0:48:01] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1257528186524622851
[0:48:02] <%Grayhammatter> holy shit
[0:48:02] <ValberParadox> @RioGascar Read her book
[0:48:06] <%DatAsuna> I don't hate the new crystal lore I just hate that canon only allows ONE kind of crystal for everything
[0:48:11] <+kewlmyc> LOUD NOISES
[0:48:12] <ashenjuan25> I think the new crystal stuff is dumb
[0:48:12] <%Gruhunchously> Nothing personnel kid
[0:48:14] <%subjectg> I prefer the synthetics honestly, but i’m just indifferent with the new lore
[0:48:15] <thequickbrownrabbit> locks lightsaber crystal in a room with the barney theme for 48 hours boom done
[0:48:20] <+tearknack> @DatAsuna oh, thats kind of lame
[0:48:25] <DSD24> Oh wow this poor Sith
[0:48:26] <%DatAsuna> because it makes red the only colour that can ever be personal
[0:48:27] <Redblood801> What did he say! I can't hear anything due to the lightning!
[0:48:34] <%ChoculaUltra> SQUAD
[0:48:35] <%Gruhunchously> Fortunately we have ten Mandos on our side
[0:48:40] <Tucker0603> how far into this planet has woolz gotten?
[0:48:43] <%Grayhammatter> the SQUAD
[0:48:43] <DSD24> Me and the bois about to stab some Sith
[0:48:44] <ashenjuan25> I hate that sith can only have red lightsabers
[0:48:44] <%hoenhime344> this was a SHITTY infiltration attemp
[0:48:47] <%RioGascar> Is there still rainbow colored sabers in the new lore
[0:48:53] <lotharrio> "Nice try, I'm behind 10 Mandos."
[0:49:00] <%RioGascar> that shit made me so made to hear was a thing
[0:49:09] <ValberParadox> The Mandalorians are the weapons.
[0:49:13] <%DatAsuna> poor little sith
[0:49:22] <%Gruhunchously> A mando who isn't prepared to kill in an instant is no Mando
[0:49:29] <lotharrio> You "can" come back, but it's only good for grabbing the items or finishing sidequests if you rushed things.
[0:49:32] <ValberParadox> @ashenjuan25 they don't have to, enter Revan
[0:49:32] <+Estuko> Oh shit I thought this stream would auto play, damn it! I was in middle of a game lol
[0:49:34] <%NocturnGamma> But how else will the children know who the bad man is?
[0:49:56] <ashenjuan25> Mainline Star Wars is dumb
[0:49:57] <muniea3> great, perfect
[0:50:05] <%NocturnGamma> We ignore that now lol
[0:50:09] <DSD24> Wow
[0:50:13] <thequickbrownrabbit> nothing personal kid
[0:50:14] <%Grayhammatter> wow, they got fucked
[0:50:15] <lotharrio> "Psh, nothing personnel, Sith."
[0:50:17] <%Grayhammatter> OH SHIT
[0:50:22] <%Gruhunchously> Oh shit
[0:50:31] <%Ecchigun> lol the flying kick
[0:50:33] <lotharrio> Would be good on Handmaiden
[0:50:39] <thequickbrownrabbit> why did you kill our clan to measure my abiltys
[0:50:40] <Go4theKnees> how far into this is he?
[0:50:40] <alexandrecau> It's ok you have the waifu squad
[0:50:51] <ashenjuan25> There’s only 2 really good movies everything else you have to like despite one or more elements of the movie
[0:50:53] <%Grayhammatter> zap them fools
[0:50:57] <lotharrio> @Go4theKnees The second planet after the two prologues.
[0:50:58] <Halospaz117> @Go4theKnees This is his second planet

[0:51:52] <DSD24> @Bluemanzee Plus we got that extra content in
[0:51:54] <%subjectg> it’s one of the shorter rpgs imo

[0:52:02] <%Gruhunchously> You should really bring HK for this one.

[0:53:53] <ingman112> HK!
[0:53:55] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @WoolieVersus it may seem strange but Cando is actually way better at melee combat than range
[0:53:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> HK FOR NON-DARK INFLUENCE
[0:54:01] <%DatAsuna> almost as if he's on some kind of performance enhancing stim
[0:54:08] <ValberParadox> If you're not dark side, Handmaiden all the way
[0:54:10] <%TheFabledAble> kreia is an AMAZING choice for this
[0:54:15] <+Bluemanzee> Mira isn't even harming the overall coolness that's how cool everyone else but her is

[0:57:37] <BallerSwagBro9k> Shes.......kinda pale

[0:57:39] <ashenjuan25> Where’s space Edward Said
[0:57:41] <alexandrecau> You don't have friends Cando
[0:57:43] <Daxalog> This looks like an entirely different game
[0:57:50] <DSD24> Isn't Dagon in Mortal Kombat Armageddon?

[0:58:10] <jorniev> man if only it was a party of 4
[0:58:14] <%RioGascar> Well asuna we are NEXT TO A SPACE PORT
[0:58:22] <memejima> The mythical O-Pass
[0:58:23] <%a_goth_pancake> hello clone wars narrator man/admiral yularen
[0:58:26] <%DatAsuna> he parried your convo
[0:58:30] <jorniev> good questions
[0:58:30] <%tumzfestival> Wait...
[0:58:36] <%emperordread> In soviet space russia, party has dialogue quest for you
[0:58:37] <%DatAsuna> During thejedi civil war
[0:58:37] <ThePimpGuin> fucking Mandolore ask you questions!
[0:58:42] <lotharrio> Fought with Revan during the Jedi Civil War.
[0:58:46] <%Gruhunchously> Mandalore asks YOU questions
[0:58:57] <%tumzfestival> Is he a planetary representative?!
[0:59:00] <ashenjuan25> Holy shit that is yularen
[0:59:01] <ATPsoldat> 1
[0:59:10] <%DatAsuna> 3 is a carth answer
[0:59:18] <ATPsoldat> No one wants to be a carth
[0:59:22] <lotharrio> "Didn't realize magic was so fucking strong."
[0:59:30] <+evbites> his armor is fantastic
[0:59:40] <+tearknack> wtf is canderous talking about
[0:59:42] <alexandrecau> suth or jedi he can still force push you
[0:59:52] <+tearknack> they totally did fight jedi before
[0:59:57] <steelstwitchaccount> Oh he was red.
[0:59:58] <ThePimpGuin> he was super red but honorable
[0:59:59] <+Estuko> @evbites his armour is so rad I purposely kept him and played as him most of the time once I got him LUL
[0:59:59] <+tearknack> that was the whole thing with exar kun
[1:00:03] <lotharrio> Cando was a practical red.
[1:00:09] <DSD24> He was Red but not a asshole
[1:00:15] <ThePimpGuin> lawful evil
[1:00:19] <%Gruhunchously> @tearknack Yeah, he literally just said that
[1:00:21] <+Bluemanzee> Cando talking about war like "Was it good for you?"
[1:00:26] <%tumzfestival> there itis
[1:00:33] <ATPsoldat> Goto seems more like a lawful evil
[1:00:37] <%DatAsuna> Cnado just handwaves exar kun as not counting cause he was too young
[1:00:37] <%emperordread> Didn't he laugh about burning planets?
[1:00:42] <+tearknack> @Gruhunchously yeah but the way he phrased it as "he was already a sith" is bs, cause they had to fight jedi
[1:00:43] <%DatAsuna> Cando just has johns about it
[1:00:44] <Breakfast_Megapowers> I only have a few options of things to watch https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/462113324918636554/707737977400328212/20200506_194030.jpg
[1:00:54] <%RioGascar> i dont think cando would say laugh at someone’s regular misery
[1:00:57] <lotharrio> No-no, in KOTOR there's Red/Blue and Practical/Enthusiastic.
[1:01:00] <candidateplays> 2 is the accurate one
[1:01:03] <steelstwitchaccount> Which is why we Malachor V'd em'
[1:01:05] <+evbites> aww thanks
[1:01:06] <+valiard> hey
[1:01:06] <%subjectg> 2 is my pick
[1:01:08] <%DatAsuna> It really is
[1:01:13] <alexandrecau> Yes yes your dick was big, we still chopped it
[1:01:16] <Klefth> This guy is the shit
[1:01:27] <%DatAsuna> whoops automod
[1:01:29] <thequickbrownrabbit> The jedi order is really just a bunch of karens with 3 people who actually do shit
[1:01:41] <%DatAsuna> Well lucien draay did shit
[1:01:41] <%RioGascar> if they dont engage in a way that makes them a threat or thing for honor i dont see cando as fighting for no reason
[1:01:43] <%DatAsuna> it's just
[1:01:46] <%DatAsuna> he did all the wrong shit
[1:01:48] <lotharrio> ...I mean, maybe. But that would have also required the Mandalorians to wipe out like... half the life in the galaxy.
[1:01:53] <jorniev> yeaaah sure just like the ligeon in fallout new vegas
[1:01:54] <ashenjuan25> Cando is the idealized version of a mandalorian
[1:01:56] <+Invlux> @Breakfast_Megapowers yoo Heavy Metal dvd
[1:01:56] <ValberParadox> I would imagine that if the Mandalorians won, Palpatine would never come to power.
[1:02:04] <steelstwitchaccount> If "Ifs" & "Buts" were Candy & Nuts, we'd all have a Merry Christmas. :P
[1:02:04] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[1:02:05] <+MagicBeanBurrito> Yeah
[1:02:09] <%DatAsuna> the chiss .etc
[1:02:11] <alexandrecau> they would still have lost to siths
[1:02:12] <lotharrio> Vhong
[1:02:16] <lotharrio> Yuuzhan Vhon.
[1:02:16] <%DatAsuna> Yuuzhan vong
[1:02:17] <DSD24> The what?
[1:02:18] <%Gruhunchously> Yuhzan Vong
[1:02:19] <%CursedNobleman> force kinks
[1:02:19] <+tearknack> the yuzhang vong
[1:02:23] <+captain_history> Yuuzan Vong
[1:02:23] <%DatAsuna> Also they're not from the unknown regions
[1:02:25] <ATPsoldat> Yeah, we would have to deal with Thrawns instead of Sidious.
[1:02:26] <+tearknack> but the vong are from another galaxy
[1:02:36] <illTemperedSeaBass> Sparta is my favorite ancient Greek city-state. Still glad they never fully conquered Greece, for the same reason I'm glad the Mandalorians didn't win.
[1:02:39] <ashenjuan25> The vhong are dumb tho
[1:02:43] <%Gruhunchously> The Mandos would be the Imperium form 40K
[1:02:46] <%DatAsuna> I like the bong on paper
[1:02:46] <ATPsoldat> Warrior culture don't last long
[1:02:53] <+tearknack> eh, i liked the Vong
[1:02:55] <%legacy0117> Just woke up. YAY it's Little V!! :>
[1:02:57] <%RioGascar> space sparta would not be able to govern at a galatic level
[1:02:57] <lotharrio> @tearknack They'd presumably see them coming, though... like because they ran out of enemies and would be looking for something to nuke.
[1:02:58] <%DatAsuna> I meant vong but I stand by it
[1:03:01] <%subjectg> i’m of the mind the mandos would be nothing but sith puppets had they won
[1:03:05] <+tearknack> @DatAsuna you like the bong ah
[1:03:19] <thequickbrownrabbit> they got 5 stars space gta style
[1:03:23] <%DatAsuna> I do
[1:03:24] <Exodusprime1256> no John's cando. no johns
[1:03:26] <DSD24> "Our battle will be LEGENDARY"
[1:03:32] <+tearknack> never tried a bong
[1:03:32] <%DatAsuna> But also the vong concept is cool I just hate their aesthetic
[1:03:37] <+jake5713> Vong were dope.
[1:03:39] <illTemperedSeaBass> @Gruhunchously Not quite so xenophobic. It'd be a galactic slave-state.
[1:03:39] <+BlockingDisabled> I think Canderous encountered something from Unknown Space before, remember that story from KotOR 1?
[1:03:40] <+oda_flobunaga> When Kyle Katarn got to fight the Vong, it was pretty awesome
[1:03:46] <+tearknack> oh yeah, the aestehtic is eh
[1:03:46] <thequickbrownrabbit> ncr
[1:03:48] <%RioGascar> like mandolorians aren’t exactly a race that handles diplomacy and politics and things that keep governments stable going
[1:03:50] <%DatAsuna> But going all organic and spacefaring without engines is rad
[1:03:50] <ATPsoldat> See the Empire
[1:03:50] <+tearknack> and i like bdsm lol
[1:03:55] <Klefth> Oh hey, it's south american history in a nutshell
[1:03:59] <+PhantomMiG> Sparta
[1:03:59] <+MagicBeanBurrito> Roman empire
[1:04:04] <%DatAsuna> I like that they basically cruise around like the tyranids do
[1:04:04] <DSD24> See Caesar's Legion
[1:04:05] <steelstwitchaccount> The Galactic Empire under Palps
[1:04:09] <%Chatterbox1991> See the Greater German Reich
[1:04:12] <%SilvaChariot0133> Overextension is just a number Kappa
[1:04:13] <lotharrio> Not a single Mandolorian in that camp was trying to grow food for them. They are entirely reliant on making back alley deals for grains.
[1:04:15] <%DatAsuna> just fall through gravity wells
[1:04:16] <Klefth> See: Simon Bolivar
[1:04:16] <candidateplays> Literally thousands of years of rule in those states you just said
[1:04:21] <Exodusprime1256> see Caesars legion
[1:04:24] <ATPsoldat> Empire under Thrawn would have been much more deadly.
[1:04:25] <+BubbaRands> See the Brits~ See the Brits~
[1:04:25] <lotharrio> Oh no... only a thousand years of peace.
[1:04:27] <+NWannabe> See USA circa
[1:04:27] <%subjectg> You say that, but we’re living in a corporate empire atm
[1:04:28] <%Gruhunchously> Hey, a couple thousand years is no joke
[1:04:29] <+NWannabe> now?
[1:04:35] <Klefth> LUL
[1:04:36] <%RioGascar> Nah palpatine had a master plan
[1:04:36] <Redblood801> I blame the Ruusan Reformation
[1:04:38] <+MagicBeanBurrito> The S E N A T E
[1:04:41] <%RioGascar> he control it all
[1:04:44] <eliudfs1> To be fair, the Republic had multiple golden ages
[1:04:44] <+tearknack> I AM THE SENATE
[1:04:49] <+tearknack> SO ITS TREASON
[1:04:49] <%Jetzord> And then the new republic gets blown up
[1:04:53] <%DatAsuna> It wasn't even his final form!
[1:04:53] <%RioGascar> no one CAN RUN SHIT ON THIS SCALE
[1:04:55] <%legacy0117> How you doing Little V? Was worried!
[1:04:56] <eliudfs1> and multiple milenia of peace
[1:05:07] <thequickbrownrabbit> the darkside made him brown like a week old banada
[1:05:09] <+oda_flobunaga> Empire Under Thrawn got defeated by a frackking slave race that stabbed them in the back
[1:05:14] <%Ashenik1> eeee honestly imperisalism big bad right, but if you live in the stable empire its kindda nice thing
[1:05:25] <Chisas_Dead_Body> OH BOY
[1:05:31] <%DatAsuna> Yeah thrawn's fatal mistake was also his supposed strength
[1:05:42] <Chisas_Dead_Body> 50 minutes of dialogue
[1:05:44] <+NWannabe> You need Spartans AND Athenians working together
[1:05:49] <Chisas_Dead_Body> I love it a lot
[1:05:51] <Klefth> In other words, you'd be fucked
[1:05:51] <%DatAsuna> akak assume things about people based on their culture
[1:05:55] <+MagicBeanBurrito> just kill the thirsty and hungry
[1:06:01] <lotharrio> They'd get integrated, like Mira, into the Mandolorian system.
[1:06:07] <%RioGascar> So thrawnes biggest mistake is
[1:06:07] <+oda_flobunaga> Thrawn was a tactical/strategic genius who couldn't play politics
[1:06:09] <%Gruhunchously> On the one hand, another 50 minutes of dialogue, on the other hand, I'm here for this shit, so...
[1:06:12] <%RioGascar> Underestimating
[1:06:24] <+tearknack> yeah
[1:06:29] <%Ashenik1> you say Gengis with ch like church
[1:06:30] <+oda_flobunaga> Politicians got to Politic
[1:06:36] <%BisoromiBear> "We're going west, are you in or what?"
[1:06:36] <%DatAsuna> What happened to the mongols though is they kinda just ended up getting turned into the chinese
[1:06:37] <+MrAtheGreat> Genghis Khan also ruled with fear.
[1:06:38] <+tearknack> thrawns biggest msitake was his shit taste in art
[1:06:40] <+tearknack> there
[1:06:42] <+tearknack> i said it
[1:06:43] <+oda_flobunaga> Palps got to Palp
[1:06:56] <candidateplays> plenty of people managed large conquests and consolidated them. The romans lasted until 1453.
[1:07:02] <PinkSocks> Revan understood snacks
[1:07:10] <%DatAsuna> Thrawn had good taste ins carves tho
[1:07:12] <steelstwitchaccount> I mean, anything you do for the Republic right now is just getting it ready for Palps
[1:07:18] <ATPsoldat> Oof
[1:07:31] <DSD24> It was incomptence
[1:07:32] <%legacy0117> Those answers...
[1:07:36] <+evbites> it was petty shit dogma
[1:07:37] <%ChoculaUltra> 4. Yeah, big big cowards.
[1:07:38] <%Gruhunchously> Yeah, these answers aren't great
[1:07:39] <DSD24> Incompetence
[1:07:44] <thequickbrownrabbit> the jedi wanted to speak to their manager
[1:07:45] <+tearknack> 1 is true
[1:07:47] <+MagicBeanBurrito> 2
[1:07:48] <+evbites> scared of sining
[1:07:49] <+tearknack> the reasons sucked
[1:07:52] <lotharrio> The Jedi weren't hiding out of fear. They were just indecisive.
[1:07:52] <ATPsoldat> 1 is technically true
[1:07:52] <Camail> it wasnt fear, technically
[1:07:55] <+tearknack> but they had reasons
[1:07:56] <%DatAsuna> 3 isn't really a defense either
[1:07:59] <giga_bit> I mean, it honestly wasn't fear. In the literal sense, at least.
[1:08:07] <Daxalog> Your a light sider. So jedi is your hometown now
[1:08:20] <steelstwitchaccount> gOoD rEasOnS
[1:08:20] <+BlockingDisabled> It WAS fear, but fear of the Dark Side, not the Mandos.
[1:08:24] <illTemperedSeaBass> It wasn't *fear* that kept the Jedi out. The inflection makes the statement true.
[1:08:47] <lotharrio> "Revan deserves respect. But on the down low, you're a massive badass and I like you."
[1:08:48] <%DatAsuna> Well they are, mostly
[1:08:49] <+tearknack> it was sort of fear though
[1:08:52] <+evbites> smug jedi:we do not fear the mandos we fear ourselves
[1:08:52] <%SilvaChariot0133> This is the way
[1:08:53] <+tearknack> but it wasnt't
[1:08:59] <+tearknack> yeah, what @BlockingDisabled said
[1:09:00] <+prime_name> this is the way
[1:09:01] <+IamGrapes> This is the way
[1:09:04] <%Gruhunchously> This is the way
[1:09:04] <steelstwitchaccount> And turn all Peace Loving at some point down the line.
[1:09:05] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:09:07] <+Ixek> This is the way.
[1:09:18] <+oda_flobunaga> Do you know the Way?
[1:09:20] <%legacy0117> I never did the side quests, so this is new for me. Good stuff. ^^
[1:09:22] <GarbageNirvana> "We don't do push-ups. We push the galaxy down."
[1:09:23] <ch3ggy> !motivated
[1:09:23] <@Moobot> 1066 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[1:09:26] <CaptHat211> Dust off some Chuck Norris jokes.
[1:09:27] <ch3ggy> HELL YEAH
[1:09:33] <%DatAsuna> There's non-warrior mandos
[1:09:35] <lotharrio> The major turning points were war and battle.
[1:09:36] <%Gruhunchously> The Mandalorian warrior never sleeps, though he dreams of conquest
[1:09:39] <muniea3> Mandos don't do push-ups, they push the planet away
[1:09:47] <%ChoculaUltra> now that's an era of the internet I'm so grateful we're past
[1:09:52] <ATPsoldat> There's Twilek hooker.
[1:10:05] <steelstwitchaccount> The exiles life HAS revolved around the same things.
[1:10:05] <+tearknack> oh god
[1:10:09] <+tearknack> okay so
[1:10:09] <%oldneckbeard> do we every see a female mando?
[1:10:14] <+tearknack> i was aorund for chuck norris memes
[1:10:19] <lotharrio> Answer 1 is Space Paladin.
[1:10:19] <+tearknack> but i never got it
[1:10:19] <Dangerzone979> chuck norris is a bitch
[1:10:21] <steelstwitchaccount> Only in the clone wars tv series.
[1:10:25] <lotharrio> @oldneckbeard Mira is, technically.
[1:10:26] <+BlockingDisabled> Mira is kind of a Mando IIRC
[1:10:27] <%subjectg> “And by uniting the disparate clans, I will create my own Outer Heaven!”
[1:10:28] <+oda_flobunaga> Reven's Mask was a female Mando's mask
[1:10:30] <dead_harmony13> Lmao gl
[1:10:30] <stainingspade0> @oldneckbeard SWTOR
[1:10:31] <Chisas_Dead_Body> Uh huh
[1:10:34] <thequickbrownrabbit> Answer 1 would forgive obeto
[1:10:40] <+tearknack> why did people ever think chuck norris was cool
[1:10:42] <steelstwitchaccount> More like a Child Soldier pulled along for the ride.
[1:10:51] <%DatAsuna> @oldneckbeard comics and books are full of them
[1:10:55] <lotharrio> Well Mandalorian is a culture anyway.
[1:10:57] <Dangerzone979> @oldneckbeard like in this game or in the greater setting?
[1:11:10] <%Gruhunchously> Hmm HMMM
[1:11:12] <+tearknack> @oldneckbeard books, comics, 1s in Rebels
[1:11:15] <%legacy0117> lol.
[1:11:18] <%oldneckbeard> okay thanks chat
[1:11:19] <LilacKing> Vegeta
[1:11:23] <CaptHat211> @ATPsoldat Woolie is part Skesis
[1:11:25] <%xcompleasedad> FREE LOOT
[1:11:29] <+MagicBeanBurrito> It rhymes
[1:11:30] <sendart> woolie turning into the birds from the dark crystal
[1:11:40] <%ChoculaUltra> lowkey also sounds like Dark Souls NPC dialogue lmao
[1:11:44] <%RioGascar> We see female mandos in the mandolorian
[1:11:56] <%subjectg> You’re gonna burn, alright
[1:11:57] <steelstwitchaccount> It's fascinating to me that, in the world of Star Wars, they still have Concepts of Heaven & Hell.
[1:12:04] <Breakfast_Megapowers> how much of Woolies love for this game revolve around Mandalorians
[1:12:04] <steelstwitchaccount> And call them by those names.
[1:12:12] <%DatAsuna> tl;dr there are many female mandos
[1:12:13] <candidateplays> There's a femal Mandalorian IN THIS GAME
[1:12:14] <CaptHat211> There are numerous female Mandalorians in TCW cartoon
[1:12:17] <ATPsoldat> Can we talk in a place not full of air traffic?
[1:12:18] <+oda_flobunaga> Female Mandos appear in the Old Republic comics
[1:12:28] <thequickbrownrabbit> pockets would invent force loot all
[1:12:30] <+prime_name> They probably think it's a really special gun
[1:12:32] <lotharrio> @steelstwitchaccount Well that's because the Word of God is almighty and present in all reality. Hallelujah, Amen.
[1:12:34] <+LiterallyTotori> mandalorian? more like mandon'tlorian
[1:12:38] <%DatAsuna> there's also rodian mandos
[1:12:38] <Carl_Von_Lucoa> yo wassup woolie
[1:12:45] <%alpharius88> pocket's took their weapons y sold them
[1:12:53] <theotrainwreck> im gettin some real brudda vibes off this dude
[1:12:58] <+tearknack> yeah mandos don't have to be human
[1:13:01] <%RioGascar> Im still amazed the mandolorians didnt manage to blow up their home planet
[1:13:02] <LeafSprout> How did you become the mandalore?
[1:13:11] <%subjectg> mandos originally weren’t human, too
[1:13:14] <+tearknack> @LeafSprout be the biggest badass, get the helmet
[1:13:18] <ATPsoldat> Revan is fucking Sun Tzu
[1:13:21] <%subjectg> the taung came first no)
[1:13:23] <lotharrio> Yo what happens if Excalibur fell in the ocean?
[1:13:30] <%Double_Tap_That> These pocketsssss are deep
[1:13:31] <steelstwitchaccount> So Anakin is literally Jesus.
[1:13:38] <CaptHat211> Do you think Mandalorians would love Warhammer 40K?
[1:13:38] <lotharrio> Yeah
[1:13:43] <%Gruhunchously> She took it and put it in her pockets
[1:13:44] <The_err0r> Same with the dark saber
[1:13:46] <LeafSprout> are you telling me mandalorians used to worship one dude
[1:13:46] <thequickbrownrabbit> sells mandos helmet ath the nearest spacemart for 100 credits
[1:13:46] <CrmznOgre> it would be funny if Revans helmet was Mandalore's helmet
[1:13:47] <%legacy0117> Easily
[1:13:48] <ThePimpGuin> how did you get the helmet back? "I found it in the cargo hold" "what?" .."what?"
[1:13:48] <+Llewelln> some aquatic tart in ponds distrubuting swords is no way to determine legitimate authority
[1:13:52] <%subjectg> Strange women lying in ponds is no basis for a system of government
[1:13:52] <%Jetzord> Like Killmonger burning the flowers
[1:13:54] <CrmznOgre> like extra fuck you
[1:13:57] <%Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus the Persians had a thing where the political and cultural power was concontrated in a holy statue: capture the statue you hold the society hostage
[1:13:58] <+Zouledge> @lotharrio it kind of did since it was returned to the lady of the lake after arthur died iirc
[1:14:09] <%DatAsuna> well you weren't
[1:14:13] <+oda_flobunaga> Reven's helmet was a female's mando's helm
[1:14:14] <%DatAsuna> Revan seperates from the party
[1:14:22] <illTemperedSeaBass> @steelmorrigan I mean, most religions have had concepts of heavens and hells. Valhalla and Helheim, Mount Olympus and the Realm of Hades (specifically Tartarus), etc.
[1:14:24] <%DatAsuna> You were just on the star forge when she beat him
[1:14:33] <+evbites> @lotharrio you have to deal with the bitch of the sea and she is really salty
[1:14:35] <lotharrio> @Zouledge Yeah but water sprite holding onto it until the sleeping king reawakens is different than, "Oops, dropped it into the Marianas Trench."
[1:14:41] <stainingspade0> @lotharrio oh wait… Excalibur fell in a lake, guess no one’s gonna be king now
[1:14:46] <jnaynnay> mrfeel1Monokumafloss_SO mrfeel1Monokumafloss_SO mrfeel1Monokumafloss_SO mrfeel1Monokumafloss_SO
[1:14:48] <thequickbrownrabbit> pockets was using it as a chip bowl
[1:14:49] <%legacy0117> Revan is female? Never knew that.
[1:14:58] <+Zouledge> @lotharrio fair point
[1:15:02] <+Ixek> Hah.
[1:15:02] <gruulmagebeast> in woolies canen
[1:15:03] <+jake5713> Like the Darksaber thousands of years late...old habits die hard I guess.
[1:15:03] <+tearknack> revan is male or female
[1:15:04] <%Gruhunchously> @legacy0117 You choose Revan's gender in this game
[1:15:04] <steelstwitchaccount> There were swords in the last game stronger than lightsabers/
[1:15:05] <theotrainwreck> Are the mandos in this just the Romans? war society based on truth and not lying and shit?
[1:15:06] <+MagicBeanBurrito> Kreia's got spunk
[1:15:12] <+tearknack> "canon" revan is a dude
[1:15:12] <+BlockingDisabled> Kreia gives lore!
[1:15:19] <+tearknack> but swotor
[1:15:20] <ATPsoldat> @legacy0117 CANONICALLY, Revan is male. But that's Bioware dumb shit
[1:15:24] <+oda_flobunaga> Reven is hermaphrodite
[1:15:24] <LeafSprout> question: does KOTOR1 save carry of into KOTOR2?
[1:15:26] <%legacy0117> Oh. Wow. That's interesting.
[1:15:27] <muniea3> I just wanted some blue milk
[1:15:32] <+tearknack> @LeafSprout no
[1:15:33] <%Gruhunchously> Female Revan 4 life
[1:15:34] <LeafSprout> damn
[1:15:35] <steelstwitchaccount> It do not.
[1:15:36] <candidateplays> Romans were a sedentary culture, first and foremost, nothing like The Mandos.
[1:15:41] <lotharrio> @LeafSprout No, but you tell the game really early what your last game was like.
[1:15:48] <+tearknack> @LeafSprout at the start, you pick your revans gender, and their alignment
[1:15:54] <+griffball13> ADAPT OR DIE
[1:15:54] <LeafSprout> ah ok
[1:15:55] <phatmac16> someone stop that airplane!
[1:16:01] <CaptHat211> Do you think Mandalore has an economy that has competing brands of armor cleaner complete w/ commercials?
[1:16:03] <steelstwitchaccount> That was not a very common thing about that time.
[1:16:08] <LeafSprout> pick at the start wether or not you killed mission lol
[1:16:09] <illTemperedSeaBass> @candidateplays You don't make an Empire like Rome with a "sedentary" culture.
[1:16:10] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:16:15] <lotharrio> It... will make assumptions on romance, I think.
[1:16:29] <steelstwitchaccount> I mean you basically had one choice per gender.
[1:16:37] <theotrainwreck> He took that really well
[1:16:38] <jorniev> woaaah
[1:16:40] <thequickbrownrabbit> okay boomer
[1:16:43] <lotharrio> Wasn't there lesbian space cat option?
[1:16:45] <+griffball13> ok boomer
[1:16:46] <jorniev> yes
[1:16:50] <steelstwitchaccount> I heard you could lez with Juhani but I do not recall to that.
[1:16:51] <Redblood801> ok boomer
[1:16:54] <lotharrio> So we have an explanation on why all the old party members lost their levels. GOT IT.
[1:16:57] <jorniev> mandalore the wise
[1:17:09] <%Gruhunchously> Are you trying to provoke me?
[1:17:09] <StrikingEarth> boomerlore
[1:17:10] <phatmac16> I've killed someone like you thousands of times, Jedi
[1:17:22] <%kekkerscrew> Were you trying to burn me about being old? Yeah I'm old I'm still badass
[1:17:23] <gruulmagebeast> let me get my basilisk grocery cart
[1:17:30] <candidateplays> @illTemperedSeaBass Sedentary means the form of their agriculture base. As opposed to the nomadic pastoralism of the Mongol/Turks/Steppe peoples in general, which the Mandolarians are much more closer too.
[1:17:35] <lotharrio> In fact... do we have reasons for everyone who should be a bad-ass, being low level?
[1:17:54] <LeafSprout> mandalore should start at lvl 99
[1:17:55] <lotharrio> So real quick! Mandalore should be a melee character, fuck what he's built as already. His stats are already set!
[1:17:56] <steelstwitchaccount> The game needs to happen.
[1:17:58] <%Gruhunchously> Armor doen'st restrict Dex rolls for attack, only for defense.
[1:17:59] <alexandrecau> low level still mean you kill 10 men
[1:18:11] <%sund0wner> Hi Wools, hi everyone
[1:18:11] <+Justlaxy> I didn't know that about the implants I feel ashamed.
[1:18:14] <%sund0wner> Thanks for the gift sub!
[1:18:19] <%kekkerscrew> Naw Mandalore should be full heavy weapons
[1:18:21] <+oda_flobunaga> Give Cando Swords PLS
[1:18:24] <%Gruhunchously> Cando for melee, HK for ranged, I would say.
[1:18:25] <%RioGascar> never knew this was a mechanic
[1:18:30] <%RioGascar> then again dumb child
[1:18:35] <Fathuran> @lotharrio because you could have gone to this planet first. video gamessss
[1:18:37] <thequickbrownrabbit> it be funny if mandos alinement effects his appernce evil mando just has angry eyebrows drawn on the helm
[1:18:37] <gruulmagebeast> now mandalore never looks different now matter what you give him right?
[1:18:43] <CaptHat211> The one downside is what are Mandalorians doing when they're not fighting b/c I can't picture Mandalorians grocery shopping in that amor.
[1:18:45] <%Chatterbox1991> Patrick Henry: Give me straight up Liberty or give me straight up Death!
[1:18:48] <%Gruhunchously> Mandalorian booty
[1:18:48] <LeafSprout> woolie admires flat mandalore ass
[1:18:49] <CaptHat211> *armor
[1:18:52] <+Llewelln> level 4 implants give immunity to shock, stun and a few others. key to have
[1:18:53] <%Reverend_Roscoe> FEELS GREAT
[1:18:58] <%Gruhunchously> Old man ass
[1:19:00] <candidateplays> You literally cannot give Mandalore new armor. That is his armor
[1:19:00] <%subjectg> But they already regen health anyway, so i think the regen implant is superfluous
[1:19:05] <+Zyquux> 5Head Cando
[1:19:06] <StrikingEarth> many feets
[1:19:06] <ThePimpGuin> swords!
[1:19:09] <thequickbrownrabbit> feels like im wearing nothing at all nothing at all nothing at all
[1:19:12] <thequickbrownrabbit> mando
[1:19:13] <gruulmagebeast> how come we never see mandalorian women besides in rebels?
[1:19:15] <lotharrio> Aww. Oh well.
[1:19:20] <steelstwitchaccount> Mas guns
[1:19:21] <ThePimpGuin> he got no dex tho
[1:19:24] <steelstwitchaccount> *max
[1:19:27] <candidateplays> No Dex
[1:19:29] <%Reverend_Roscoe> Soldier is Reggie class cuz of all the FEATS
[1:19:29] <+Zyquux> Ranged Mandalore DansGame
[1:19:42] <+Abdul1295> did woolie see narutos and hinatas wedding. it's pretty funny especially with Orichimaru goofing around the town
[1:19:43] <CaptHat211> @gruulmagebeast There are Mandalorian women in TCW
[1:19:43] <+oda_flobunaga> Max Guns and no DEX to hit with
[1:19:43] <%DatAsuna> rifle
[1:19:51] <+MrAtheGreat> It may look bland, but that ass is so tough that when a hand tries to clap it, that hands gets clapped first.
[1:19:51] <steelstwitchaccount> But max guns tho
[1:19:58] <candidateplays> WHY?????
[1:19:59] <+Zyquux> Why waste all of his strength and his free strength bonus
[1:20:00] <%DatAsuna> Heavy repeater is the way
[1:20:04] <%subjectg> what a shame, mando is a beast with melee
[1:20:06] <%Gruhunchously> Don't forget to give him Precise Shot
[1:20:09] <theotrainwreck> how come the mando women question comes back up every few minutes? They around, also chat hornee
[1:20:12] <thequickbrownrabbit> its high noon
[1:20:12] <LeafSprout> @gruulmagebeast because people used to be sexist about stuff related to star wars before the clone wars
[1:20:19] <%DatAsuna> Nah cando is heavy weapons guy
[1:20:21] <ThePimpGuin> it feels right but its so inefficient
[1:20:22] <lotharrio> Plus on a Lightside playthrough there's no one else to give Tremor Swords.
[1:20:33] <gruulmagebeast> the mandalorian wage gap is false
[1:20:35] <LeafSprout> clone wars introduced most of the popular female characters
[1:20:40] <ATPsoldat> Cando seems like a rifle guy
[1:20:54] <%kekkerscrew> LeafSprout People " Used " to be sexist about Starwars? cmonBruh
[1:20:57] <%Gruhunchously> Female Mandalorians get one fourth less honor.
[1:21:03] <steelstwitchaccount> More like a gatling gun guy... which he started with in the last one.
[1:21:03] <theotrainwreck> ye TCW has the best female characters in Star Wars
[1:21:08] <+Llewelln> I like to have a melee assistant to take them away from me
[1:21:10] <illTemperedSeaBass> @candidateplays While it may play a part in it, agricultural base is different from culturally sedentary. They may have farmed, but they were culturally amongst the most expansionistic people in western history. People *voluntarily* enlisted into the permanent standing army. Both were largely unheard of before, and for thousands of years afterward.
[1:21:18] <+oda_flobunaga> Clone Wars didn't introduce Mara Jade or Zori Bliss
[1:21:24] <ATPsoldat> Ahsoka Tano might be a great character, but she didn't start out as one.
[1:21:27] <steelstwitchaccount> Whom?
[1:21:28] <LeafSprout> is best boi Carth in this game
[1:21:38] <lotharrio> Yeah but except for his starting feats, statwise he's built for melee, and since he's stuck in heavy armor, dex loses most of its appeal.
[1:21:40] <%a_goth_pancake> ashokaaaaa...
[1:21:49] <$drabberfaun535> Cheer500 Hey V and double V Hoes mad 2 :the sithlords was Aprils hottest single, and Im hyped for your next song Dokapon :Blood money.
[1:22:02] <theotrainwreck> actually now that I think about it most of the cool chicks in TCW started out dumb, especially Ventris and Ahsoka
[1:22:24] <theotrainwreck> Ventris gets REALLY cool
[1:22:42] <+oda_flobunaga> DOn't forget what's her face from Rogue One
[1:22:44] <CaptHat211> Oh stop it, chat. There were FEMALE Mandalorians in past works like the Republic Commandos series which was pre-Disney.
[1:22:54] <LeafSprout> I would say most characeters in the first 2 seasons started out pretty dumb, not just the females
[1:23:01] <theotrainwreck> thas true
[1:23:01] <steelstwitchaccount> I have, indeed, forgotten what's her face from Rogue One.
[1:23:05] <%Gruhunchously> Soldiers have feats pretty much every level, yes
[1:23:08] <+AverageBlubber> Y'know, Since Mando kept traveling with Revan you think he's dark side crusty under the helmet?
[1:23:10] <%legacy0117> So yeah this guy is built like a literal tank.
[1:23:10] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1257528186524622851
[1:23:11] <theotrainwreck> ani started out unbearable
[1:23:16] <LeafSprout> when is there female mandos in republic commando?
[1:23:28] <steelstwitchaccount> I only really liked ani in TCW
[1:23:35] <steelstwitchaccount> The voice helped.
[1:23:36] <lotharrio> @AverageBlubber He's just a skull under the helmet.
[1:23:37] <candidateplays> @illTemperedSeaBass You're using a completely bizarre definition of Sendentarism.
[1:23:43] <%DatAsuna> Also ventress was better in the comics than the show
[1:24:00] <theotrainwreck> The best part of TCW is the episodes that are just hanging out with Clones
[1:24:01] <%DatAsuna> Back when she was a rattataki with better tatts
[1:24:03] <+tearknack> i liked ventress in gendy
[1:24:03] <CaptHat211> @LeafSprout Vhonte Tervho
[1:24:04] <theotrainwreck> fives is mah boy
[1:24:04] <+oda_flobunaga> With all of this the obvious conclusion is Kreis is best Waifu though
[1:24:05] <%a_goth_pancake> seeing ashoka grow up plays a lot into why shes such a good character
[1:24:10] <LeafSprout> @lotharrio dude imagine skull knight mandalorian
[1:24:13] <+tearknack> no idea what she's like in 3dcw
[1:24:15] <%DatAsuna> gendy ventress runs with the comic version
[1:24:20] <+AverageBlubber> raw
[1:24:33] <%Gruhunchously> Rawr
[1:24:34] <+tearknack> well
[1:24:37] <lotharrio> @LeafSprout He opens his helmet and pulls out a sword made of lightsaber hilts.
[1:24:39] <steelstwitchaccount> Man, these uneven STR and CON scores are maddening.
[1:24:40] <jorniev> i hope the mandalorian becomes mandalore in the show... or at least gets involved with that part of the history
[1:24:41] <+tearknack> i guess i saw her in the movie lol
[1:24:52] <%subjectg> That +0 dex breaks my heart
[1:24:53] <%emperordread> "Clean ass-blasters" is the name of an adult movie
[1:25:01] <%DatAsuna> Yeah a lot of ahsoka fans were happy she grew up so they could stop feeling like pedos.
[1:25:03] <LeafSprout> @lotharrio "I can make a rift through the force itself"
[1:25:10] <candidateplays> max Dex bonus of +0 - make him into a gun guy!
[1:25:19] <+oda_flobunaga> +0DEX BAD FOR GUNS THOUGH
[1:25:20] <CaptHat211> @LeafSprout It was "RC: True Colors" and several comics.
[1:25:33] <theotrainwreck> Is Rebels good?
[1:25:38] <thequickbrownrabbit> time to coat mando in flextape for ultmate armor
[1:25:39] <LeafSprout> @CaptHat211 oof i only played the game
[1:25:43] <LeafSprout> NO REBELS IS NOT GOOD
[1:25:44] <%Gruhunchously> The Dex restriction doesn't apply to guns, only defense.
[1:25:45] <green_skeleton> Do my eyes deceive me? KOTOR 2 is back?!
[1:25:47] <roaches_coaches> roaches_coaches subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:26:02] <%kekkerscrew> theotrainwreck Rebels is not good. But it has a couple of fun episodes
[1:26:06] <%subjectg> I know it doesn’t affect attack rolls, but it’s not optimal
[1:26:08] <%DatAsuna> @LeafSprout it was the RC books, not game
[1:26:10] <theotrainwreck> cool
[1:26:11] <steelstwitchaccount> Wait, so he can't get any added accuracy? I thought that only meant no DEF bonus cause of heavy armor.
[1:26:13] <lotharrio> @green_skeleton Strong chance you're drunk. G0-T0 sleep.
[1:26:19] <aloveidiots> Who would win Obi-Wan or Kakashi?
[1:26:22] <LeafSprout> oof the audio
[1:26:24] <+Zouledge> @theotrainwreck imo it has good parts but but still not as good as clone wars
[1:26:25] <illTemperedSeaBass> @candidateplays Only if the definition you're using for sedentary doesn't align with the actual definition of the word. Korea was culturally sedentary: non-active, their borders remaining almost unchanged for as long as the people have existed as evidence of it. Few people were as active as the Romans were.
[1:26:26] <+prime_name> Audio stutter?

[1:26:59] <steelstwitchaccount> Audio is fine for me?
[1:27:00] <%kekkerscrew> Rebels biggest problem is that it has incredibly bad tonal issues. It has goofy silly comedy that does not fit the story going on around it.
[1:27:05] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> that audio is CRISPY
[1:27:11] <theotrainwreck> ok ye, thats the vibe I always got from it. average with some fun moments

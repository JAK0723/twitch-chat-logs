[0:08:52] <indigochunk> Five friendly friends being five friendly friends
[0:08:54] <SilverWolfX9> I just realized I apologized to a bot. InuyoFace
[0:09:13] <indigochunk> I mean, a bot can have feelings too
[0:09:18] <CirclesForever> too right
[0:09:18] <%Itselguapo> Five friendly friends giving hugs because that's what friends do!
[0:09:24] <indigochunk> It probably appreciates it
[0:09:41] <CirclesForever> if terminator taught us nothing, its that robots have feelings too
[0:09:54] <indigochunk> Five friendly friends have a picnic at a nice park on a sunny day
[0:10:15] <SilverWolfX9> I would be scared if robots could accurately simulate human feelings. thats the day the human population stops growing since everyone dates robots.
[0:10:32] <indigochunk> Terminator taught me that magic is real
[0:10:37] <wsintai> I for one welcome our sexy robot overlords
[0:10:46] <indigochunk> Terminator: become human
[0:10:50] <%gatorafan> @indigochunk, maybe a bot can have feelings. But Moobot is not one of those.
[0:11:03] <%kimonochrono> terminator taught me that usually two movies is enough
[0:11:04] <alrobot2014> the autoblow and fleshlights would have to catch up in tech for the population drop to take off
[0:11:08] <%Itselguapo> HAPPY FRIENDS ABOUT TO HAVE A DANCE OFF!
[0:11:11] <SilverWolfX9> is moobot a cow robot?
[0:11:15] <+Dustmaw> 1. ( the great )Greta Thunborg taught me that there's too many humans anyway

[0:19:14] <Visored34> you got mugged in your local mexican arcade if you pick Rugal
[0:19:17] <%gatorafan> @jerkhov_, didi seems to be putting Brazil on the map via Samsho, so there is that.
[0:19:17] <SilverWolfX9> Why didn't NeoGeo cabinets exist in the US? I would have thought the cheapness of the cabinet would have popularized it here.
[0:19:18] <Guntanks_in_Space> they populate goddamn fightcade lol
[0:19:20] <Solidnick18> rugal is frugal

[0:20:03] <+Superbro64> did you watch j dandy's basic kof visual guide? @woolieversus
[0:20:07] <Guntanks_in_Space> oh yeah, it is unfortunate that the netcode is arse
[0:20:13] <%Wool> I'm trying to snipe Pat in Temtem
[0:20:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> BTW netplay in this game is terrible
[0:20:17] <DRAGUN_Xrd> I'mma struggle harder then in SFV over a year ago
[0:20:17] <+Superbro64> its a high recommend for kof beginners
[0:20:26] <Mordexai0> Terry is super fun in FEXL also so this will be fun
[0:20:27] <RodCU> Hope the Garou netcode patch means a good netcode for KOFXV
[0:20:29] <Guntanks_in_Space> i can't even play someone on singapore, which is near my country without it going underwater sometimes
[0:20:34] <indigochunk> Ok so I grew up very very close to South America and those KOF players aren’t that serious. I only got stabbed twice and shot at once, it’s really not that bad.

[0:38:01] <DRAGUN_Xrd> I'm gonna go figure out the lobby system so I don't ready up again on accident
[0:38:08] <%kimonochrono> best stage
[0:38:11] <%CaptainPileDriver> i'm yelling at reggie to pick him
[0:38:11] <Mvrdok_> Btw chat, there's a manga where Iori is transported to another world at the end of KoF 97 called King of Fantasy
[0:38:14] <MichaelDood> SourPls
[0:38:17] <Mordexai0> Reggie really just made a team KKK
[0:38:25] <thatbandltguy> i feel that woolie
[0:38:26] <@Menitta> KOFXV should look pretty good after Samsho
[0:38:27] <+Pigg1yJuffs> God, the models in this game are still rough.
[0:38:31] <%FeltSn0wman> mash LP
[0:38:34] <Guntanks_in_Space> @Mvrdok_ Iori continues to be OP as shit even in another world, the comic
[0:38:34] <BlackermanZX> i mean XIII was beautiful and also almost killed SNK
[0:38:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> kof 13 is the best pixel fighter period
[0:38:39] <+Polter_ge1st> ROCK MUTHAFUKIN HOWARD
[0:38:45] <indigochunk> Max gets a tingly feeling in his left nip every time Rock is mentioned.
[0:38:46] <sals5> This game is so goood tho
[0:38:52] <@Menitta> I just wish KOFXIII had a better roster.
[0:38:56] <jerkhov_> it was one of snk's first games after getting back from playmore
[0:38:56] <+bustawof> KURAINAH
[0:39:01] <Guntanks_in_Space> @Pigg1yJuffs yeah lol, a lot of the base roster looks eh at most, but there's good ones. the real problem with XIV's graphics is their shader stuff
[0:39:03] <skewerstar> Yeah, just mash Square for autocombo into super if you have meter.
[0:39:04] <Prevot> that UI is kinda eeehhh
[0:39:10] <Mvrdok_> @Guntanks_in_Space Even as a laud player LUL
[0:39:12] <Guntanks_in_Space> everything looks slathered in vaseline and i loath it
[0:39:12] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> This game's graphics are fiiine
[0:39:13] <zamzoph> King Kreygasm
[0:39:22] <%FeltSn0wman> double HCF jermaDisgust
[0:39:22] <+captain_history> The models are fine though. Not impressive but fine after the change in shaders.
[0:39:26] <jerkhov_> SF5 is an ugly game too so it's equal
[0:39:28] <Guntanks_in_Space> @Mvrdok_ iori figured that "yo this is like my bass right? all right then!"
[0:39:33] <sals5> I wish max would play 14 again
[0:39:40] <Tucker0603> King is my favorite, WOMEN IN SUITS MAN!!!
[0:39:43] <indigochunk> Yes KOF, my favorite Latin button basher
[0:39:48] <+jetjagger222> honestly this kinda looks better than sfv
[0:39:55] <Mvrdok_> @Guntanks_in_Space "I can play Wonderwall on this"
[0:39:58] <+Dualvipers> Both of my favoritve KOF characters on screen rn
[0:39:59] <BlackermanZX> trap shot is pretty good
[0:40:01] <%gatorafan> Max never finished the Terry legacy daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:40:05] <generalve> KING IS DA BEST
[0:40:07] <+captain_history> this is far more fun than SFV yeah
[0:40:08] <zamzoph> clothes didn't blow off FeelsBadMan
[0:40:09] <%croxeye> casual raging storm
[0:40:10] <+jiggy_snipe> I'm kinda tired of the SFV and SF4 look
[0:40:12] <Solidnick18> alright kim
[0:40:24] <jerkhov_> terry legacy probably should've just been fatal fury and a few kof anyway
[0:40:27] <Rangenade> those kim pants bro cmon so stiff
[0:40:30] <falconx9k> He hates evil
[0:40:35] <Prevot> this and sf5 look bad in different ways
[0:40:40] <+jetjagger222> sfv colors and proportions looked off
[0:40:41] <Guntanks_in_Space> @jetjagger222 there's a distinction on this now that you mentioned comparing SFV lol. SFV has okay texture/shaders but pretty ugly models and style, while KOFXIV has good models but awful texture/shaders
[0:40:41] <cyclpsrock> 4 diff types of jumps
[0:40:49] <%FeltSn0wman> 1 frame proximity throws ukogW
[0:40:52] <jerkhov_> this game does have some good animations at least
[0:40:53] <+bustawof> spread your wings young rock
[0:41:04] <@Menitta> This game plays so freaking well so I can forgive the subpar visuals
[0:41:06] <Guntanks_in_Space> but they also kinda have the same extremes in terms of shader stuff where SFV looks like clay at times, while yeah XIV looks like vaseline at times
[0:41:07] <skewerstar> People always talk about Terry's engrish but sleep on King's VENOM STRAIKE and TORNAD KICK!
[0:41:10] <Solidnick18> ok
[0:41:11] <indigochunk> Guys guys, come on, not all fighting games can look like guilty gear levels of presentation
[0:41:13] <sals5> 14 roster is way better than 13s tho
[0:41:14] <Guntanks_in_Space> but yeah XIV plays GOOOOOD
[0:41:20] <Guntanks_in_Space> like really good
[0:41:21] <@Menitta> Though expectations are higher for KOFXV
[0:41:29] <thatbandltguy> @Prevot from that ripped angel model in sfv lighting we can tell the problems for each are exact opposites
[0:41:40] <@Menitta> I would so much rather play KOFXIV than XIII because of the roster.
[0:41:43] <Guntanks_in_Space> also the real good part about XIV looks-wise is the ANIMATION
[0:41:45] <+bustawof> I hope they bring back shermie for 15
[0:41:50] <jerkhov_> not everyone can be as stylish a jump from sprites to 3D as guilty gear
[0:41:53] <+captain_history> I really love how they recreated Oswald's animations here.
[0:41:53] <DRAGUN_Xrd> that's the button layout I use
[0:41:56] <%croxeye> terry doesn't suck :(
[0:41:59] <Guntanks_in_Space> see Rock there and how he animates super good
[0:42:09] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah Oswald's jump to 3D went well too
[0:42:10] <Mordexai0> @croxeye His REAL dad
[0:42:11] <%croxeye> i mean he's not top tier anymore
[0:42:18] <+jetjagger222> animations are super snappy
[0:42:20] <%croxeye> Terry raised him tho
[0:42:22] <didgereedoodah> I'll believe the gameplay is great but the visuals are so bad
[0:42:26] <%croxeye> even if geese was his blood
[0:42:33] <plushysceptile> Someone a while back pointed out that in the entirety of the SNK franchise, KoF XIV is the only time Geese and Rock canonically meet
[0:42:37] <@Menitta> I am disappointed they never took advantage of being 3D and added a bunch of costumes
[0:42:44] <Guntanks_in_Space> maybe next game...
[0:42:47] <%FeltSn0wman> you also get EX specials in max mode
[0:42:50] <+jetjagger222> the visual fidelity varies per character
[0:42:51] <Mordexai0> @croxeye Yea. But Geese is alive here. So he knows how shit his real dad is
[0:42:54] <+Pigg1yJuffs> I will say, the shaders do play hell on this game. Rock's hair looks bad a d only because the shaders do little to nothing for it.
[0:42:58] <%jinking79> auto combos r in the game but who cares
[0:43:01] <Solidnick18> ior Kreygasm
[0:43:13] <@Menitta> The auto combos in this really suck
[0:43:15] <jerkhov_> randumb
[0:43:19] <@Menitta> Like even for auto combos
[0:43:25] <sals5> Autos suck in this game
[0:43:25] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1219688583491092483?s=19

[0:43:38] <+bustawof> K Dash Pog
[0:43:39] <+Dualvipers> K baby!
[0:43:39] <sals5> Like they should
[0:43:41] <%kimonochrono> the autocombos in this game are literally only if you dont know how to do anything, the damage on them is terrible and bad use of meter
[0:43:44] <MattDemers> K9999 when Kappa
[0:43:57] <%Irridium> and sometimes the auto combos just... don't come out. it's weird
[0:43:57] <Mordexai0> @mattdemers I unironically wish
[0:44:08] <BlackermanZX> K King and Ryo is my fav team
[0:44:09] <+jetjagger222> isnt this stage from real bout
[0:44:15] <fist_wizard_jay> Yo I forget was Duck King in this ome?
[0:44:19] <fist_wizard_jay> one*
[0:44:20] <@Menitta> How did KOFXIII get NESTs Kyo yet this didnt even get his NEST costume
[0:44:21] <Mordexai0> @fist_wizard_jay 11
[0:44:22] <%jinking79> Heidern got that glitch damage grab
[0:44:28] <skewerstar> Yeah! K' is great, he's like the Alex of the series!
[0:44:32] <indigochunk> I mean what even is a king of fighter?

[0:44:57] <+captain_history> K' is not as popular as Kyo but he is very popular anyway.
[0:45:03] <fist_wizard_jay> Really hope they bring him in the new KoF game
[0:45:06] <Guntanks_in_Space> K' is hella popular
[0:45:15] <Guntanks_in_Space> everyone loves the Not Bruce Lee in leather look lol
[0:45:16] <fist_wizard_jay> Duck King’s fuckin cool

[0:45:34] <Solidnick18> let's go ralph
[0:45:42] <Mvrdok_> While developing KoF 99 they planned to not include Kyo and Iori but feared the backlash and had had trouble deciding which version to put in so they added 3 Kyos LUL
[0:45:43] <didgereedoodah> rising taco
[0:45:44] <+Dualvipers> How in the world did KOF become the mexico fighting game? Growing up I played it in bootleg machines that had random arcade games but was that what got it big down there?
[0:45:46] <SomersaultJustice> it's wolly time more
[0:45:47] <nevan0> LMAO
[0:45:52] <Odyr2001> bro pat wants to fight you on tem tem rn
[0:45:53] <@Menitta> I hope KOFXV brings back more Metal Slug characters
[0:45:55] <%DomPressesButtons> @menitta this kyo is a revamped NESTS
[0:45:57] <SomersaultJustice> is this for fun or glory?
[0:46:01] <Guntanks_in_Space> @Mvrdok_ they added 3 kyos, and a "Kyo Clone" to boot (in K' lol)
[0:46:01] <fist_wizard_jay> RISING TACO
[0:46:01] <+Merhabi> Huh
[0:46:05] <%kimonochrono> woolieFUN woolieFUN woolieFUN

[0:46:17] <Mvrdok_> @Dualvipers They where cheaper than Capcom's
[0:46:20] <thatbandltguy> ralph lost his grab
[0:46:22] <indigochunk> All the fun
[0:46:25] <Guntanks_in_Space> 99 Kyo is indeed the GOAT
[0:46:25] <%Pigg1yJuffs> Pigg1yJuffs subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:46:35] <Mvrdok_> @Guntanks_in_Space Yeah LUL
[0:46:35] <Guntanks_in_Space> also Ralf doesn't have the Argentine Backbreaker anymore
[0:46:36] <SomersaultJustice> neogeo is pretty easy to emulate too
[0:46:38] <%gatorafan> Ralf no longer has a grab I think
[0:46:39] <Guntanks_in_Space> as well as the Ralf Tackle
[0:46:42] <%FeltSn0wman> yeah it's not in 13 either
[0:46:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> ?
[0:46:43] <%DomPressesButtons> same moves and slightly different jacket but still essentially NESTS
[0:46:47] <Guntanks_in_Space> now all he has are EXPLOSIVE PUNCHES
[0:46:47] <Visored34> bring back Buriki One characters
[0:46:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> he didn't have it in 13 either woolie
[0:46:55] <+Dualvipers> Ahh right I woulndt know about the price shit since that era died before I was birthed lol
[0:46:57] <%croxeye> SNK is willing to change stuff for better or worse lol
[0:46:58] <+psychocalibur> he hasn't have it since 13
[0:46:58] <SomersaultJustice> STREAM CANCELLED
[0:46:59] <+swushandsuch> owned
[0:47:00] <Guntanks_in_Space> Ralf hasn't had his command throw in XIII
[0:47:00] <thatbandltguy> they wanted to make him different to clark
[0:47:00] <MattDemers> C L A R K
[0:47:04] <thatbandltguy> cmon woolie
[0:47:05] <+RichardMF_> Clark is The Grappler now
[0:47:07] <BlackermanZX> 13 didnt have it i think
[0:47:09] <Guntanks_in_Space> Ralf Jet Upper is forever gone though, and i'm so sad about it
[0:47:12] <Solidnick18> clark is throw man
[0:47:12] <thatbandltguy> kof13 didnt have it no
[0:47:13] <%oyyzzo> woolie nerfed
[0:47:15] <jerkhov_> it's like having a down down shoryuken oh wait
[0:47:15] <cassiecagedd> Have you played SF5 they did get rid of dragon punch
[0:47:16] <Guntanks_in_Space> XIII didn't have Ralf Backbreaker
[0:47:31] <@Menitta> Clark still has his command grab iirc
[0:47:31] <Mordexai0> @visored34 KoF 11 having Buriki One characters was really a phenomenon. 11 is such a gem to me
[0:47:52] <@Menitta> 11 is still my favorite
[0:47:58] <+captain_history> Clark got all that. Ralf was like this in XIII too.
[0:47:59] <Guntanks_in_Space> XI is my favorite right after 98
[0:48:00] <@Menitta> Tag KOF is just woolieGASM
[0:48:02] <%kimonochrono> yuh
[0:48:05] <%jinking79> Clark broke KoF 13 with his grab so Ralf lost his
[0:48:06] <SomersaultJustice> snk supers
[0:48:16] <+nekodelic> remember when this game looked like absolute trash? it looks so much better now
[0:48:16] <indigochunk> Ok guys calm down, the amount of energy from the face cam is gonna scare the children
[0:48:22] <indigochunk> The children being me
[0:48:24] <Solidnick18> he wants galatica phantom

[0:48:34] <scrumbotime> Woolie almost has more people watching than Saltybet
[0:48:49] <Visored34> @Mordexai0 Kizuna Encounter and Agressors of Dark Kombat characters would be cool too
[0:48:51] <HeavyNorse> Ralf is so creamy.

[1:23:48] <Guntanks_in_Space> have a meter popped in Max mode, your supers become SDMs immediately
[1:23:57] <thatbandltguy> nope
[1:24:05] <Guntanks_in_Space> also yea going to max mode gets you the BIG DAMAGE
[1:24:12] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Ora Ora Ora Ora no1ORA
[1:24:16] <+jetjagger222> kono kobushi shouri o tsukameru
[1:24:23] <Josef_Stryker> They should've given Nelson a Pile Bunker punch
[1:24:26] <Fujiwara_92> Max mode gets you the big penis
[1:24:30] <%FeltSn0wman> advanced is level 1 > level 2
[1:24:33] <+zanzibar_junker> you can do two ex moves during max mode
[1:24:35] <+jetjagger222> @Josef_Stryker that's maxima's schtick
[1:24:40] <Josef_Stryker> Fair enough
[1:24:43] <%FeltSn0wman> climax is level 1 or level 2 > level 3

[2:07:09] <MahjongNucleus> KoF is life tho.
[2:07:11] <CrimsonCore90> Dude we didn't have arcades in the normal sense, we had corner store "maquinitas". SNK is great. KOF was king!

[2:19:19] <MahjongNucleus> As is Leona.
[2:19:26] <Tucker0603> FUCKING RAR
[2:19:30] <Guntanks_in_Space> Yamazaki became an Orochi head in canon because of Fan demand
[2:19:32] <SheefEatsBeef> oh he's doing like flicker jabs
[2:19:43] <kingkeldeo31> He's too crazy for the Orochi to control him
[2:19:46] <Guntanks_in_Space> also yeah the Snake charmer fist is practically Fiicker
[2:19:46] <skewerstar> He's literally too crazy for the Orochi!

[2:20:04] <Man_in_the_Red> Orochi aint touching Yamazaki with a 50 ft pole
[2:20:09] <%jinking79> 8 Orochi and Yamazaki's Orochi head is Death
[2:20:09] <Guntanks_in_Space> so you have Iori denying the blood riot, Leona channeling it to her advantage, and Yamazaki being too crazy to possess
[2:20:20] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah the rest of the heads are Mature and Vice, CYS, and Goenitz
[2:20:21] <+FrenchTact1cs> thats my secret... BITCH IM WILD

[2:22:28] <%CaptainPileDriver> kim is just good in every game
[2:22:29] <+zanzibar_junker> yes
[2:22:32] <Guntanks_in_Space> it is not explained but they're there

[2:22:44] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:22:51] <bazz_tv> his pants aren't as good as they where in 2d though
[2:22:51] <%CaptainPileDriver> @zanzibar_junker what game was kim bad in??
[2:22:51] <@Menitta> For the longest time it was just classic Kyo
[2:22:52] <Man_in_the_Red> @gustavozxd 14, because his pants have been burned by the sun like Icarus
[2:22:56] <Guntanks_in_Space> the early DLC was retro Kyo/Iori and Nightmare Geese
[2:22:58] <+zanzibar_junker> they are tied to Iori when he got his power back
[2:23:00] <+unnamedhero0013> Classic Iori. Mexico approves.
[2:23:03] <Guntanks_in_Space> and i think Retro Athena too
[2:23:06] <+cheezy_snackz> i would agree if his legs weren't tied together
[2:23:10] <@Menitta> Wtf how did I miss those
[2:23:13] <Guntanks_in_Space> or rather, 98 Athena
[2:23:14] <bazz_tv> RIP best pants animation in the genre
[2:23:17] <@Menitta> Nightmare Geese I knew about
[2:23:23] <arkv01> DOUSHITA
[2:23:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> god, @WoolieVersus seriously, when is the nidhogg night, as you said at frosty, it's legit
[2:23:52] <+zanzibar_junker> he was more crazy in 13, so so the last couple before that
[2:23:53] <Guntanks_in_Space> and then the next DLC set was Nonsummerjack Angel, Sundress Kula, Schoolgirl Nakoruru, Kung-fu Shun
[2:23:56] <%CaptainPileDriver> so when, i need to stab some fools and dive kick to victory
[2:24:13] <MahjongNucleus> Donde estoy mi Taco?

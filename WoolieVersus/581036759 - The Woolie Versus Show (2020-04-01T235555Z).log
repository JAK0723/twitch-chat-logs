[0:17:26] <+i_zombee> they struggle to make the couch m/k life rise. it won't. get a desk or use a controller, lol
[0:17:37] <%jiggy_snipe> the cube is so Woolie gets gamer cred. He's been a fake gamer his whole life til now
[0:17:45] <%NWannabe> cube is to exclusive
[0:17:46] <derap41> Be like Pat Cube 18 hours a day
[0:17:48] <blaggablag> I've been sent by pat to slay the non cubelievers
[0:17:49] <KaiserMario> Just like every other peripheral Woolie ever bought, it's perfect, but doesn't fit HIM...
[0:18:01] <derap41> Pat is Cube right as we speak
[0:18:26] <%lotharrio> I come to this stream for hot cube action.
[0:18:26] <MaverickJoker> gotta be honest, i've done the cube for 7 months due to health reasons, you become gelatin in just 5 months and atrophy LUL

[0:20:35] <%lotharrio> All I want is Woollie sitting comfy in a cube, looking very upset and annoyed at its practicality.

[0:02:18] <@akuda_bar> he's playing Mario Galaxy today, it's just built into the schedule for now to do an hour a week of chat also
[0:02:37] <AgentZombieMan> Why he punching a fish?
[0:02:40] <@akuda_bar> wouldn't you?
[0:02:47] <AgentZombieMan> Maybe
[0:02:49] <%JustYudha> I like these Just Chatting streams. Allows Woolie to talk without having to feel the "Woolie Talks too much" pressure
[0:02:52] <AgentZombieMan> I so hate the ocean
[0:02:53] <@Menitta> that fish had what was coming
[0:03:41] <@akuda_bar> this singer on YT sapphire does a cover of this song that's great
[0:03:54] <%Lion_kun> this is gonna be DMCAed
[0:03:56] <%emperordread> I am terrified of the ocean, actual monsters are down there
[0:03:59] <%JohnAtDawn> JohnAtDawn subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months, currently on a 13 month streak! 
[0:04:19] <+TheotherKristian> I'm in hour 30 of P5R and I am starting to drop off. That song making me regret
[0:04:19] <%r0chelimit> r0chelimit subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 7 month streak! What’s your favorite type of fight music? As much as I like a good metal or hip hop track to lay the smack down to there’s something about a fun jazzy tune to get hyped to fight. KOF and persona have plenty of good examples of this. Thoughts?
[0:04:36] <+krispen_wa> RAWK HAWK
[0:04:38] <%JustYudha> I thought this was the power rangers theme...
[0:04:40] <AgentZombieMan> I think that Arkansas gave up on 90% of copyright claiming ventures, didn't they?

[0:05:44] <%Feralspirit41> New mission; i want you to blow up THE OCEAN
[0:05:55] <%emperordread> Elon wants to explore space as a way of getting further away from THE OCEAN
[0:05:56] <%Feralspirit41> Fucking love mr torgue
[0:05:57] <abelincoln_catpuncher> I just saw Max's video on that, fucking Nintendo gotta Nintendo

[0:06:29] <@Menitta> nooooo not the puns
[0:06:34] <%Feralspirit41> Space is the future the ocean is just terrible
[0:06:35] <@akuda_bar> see? bass!
[0:06:49] <+emperordread> @Menitta actually my opinion LUL
[0:07:08] <@Solidus_113> Have you guys read the Ready Player Two paragraphs being posted recently?
[0:07:15] <DaKnightWarrior> just a nice chat :)
[0:07:15] <AgentZombieMan> Woolie has a lot of Rule 63
[0:07:16] <morphinomarshal> Unfortunately, yes
[0:07:31] <AgentZombieMan> Unfortunately?
[0:07:33] <JetpackMcQuack> Haven’t heard this in a long ass time
[0:07:40] <morphinomarshal> That author had no business getting as muc hsuccess as he did
[0:07:43] <%Feralspirit41> Theres alot because hes secretly a waman
[0:07:47] <morphinomarshal> Ready Player 1 is ass
[0:07:54] <%Feralspirit41> that movie SUCKED
[0:08:02] <Clundy> Ready Player... 2? Oh no.
[0:08:03] <AgentZombieMan> You know what else sucks?
[0:08:10] <AgentZombieMan> The Ocean
[0:08:12] <@Menitta> Ready Player One rips off the ending of Sword art online. Like straight up.
[0:08:12] <YakumoYomi> @Feralspirit41 The fact that the ocean is so deep that it could contain actual sea monsters freaks me the fuck out. Space, on the other hand, is "far away" enough that I don't worry about it
[0:08:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> A vacuum?
[0:08:16] <$SKooKuMHime> one day woolie will use my finished piece instead of the WIP
[0:08:16] <%Feralspirit41> "hey you know this video game character? how about this one? man isnt anime cool and doesnt your lives suck?"
[0:08:19] <+starzo0> hes writing another one?
[0:08:25] <@Solidus_113> I've already seen Matrix, SAO, Sailor Moon, and fucking Sonic(dot)exe
[0:08:38] <%cache_22> Ready Player Two is out already.
[0:08:46] <%Feralspirit41> i already hate it
[0:08:48] <AgentZombieMan> Hey, did you know if you bump the steam quality down to 160p, this music sounds more authentic?
[0:08:49] <morphinomarshal> Feralspirit41 It's not even that, it's written like "I bet you didn't know THIS character from THIS movie did THIS!"

[0:14:20] <%Javaa01> Well, at least DeS is the easiest one to start at, obtuse world mechanics aside
[0:14:20] <%dreadedcthulhu> I'm stoked on reggiesouls
[0:14:21] <%cache_22> I think Woolie should at least try out Astro's Playroom for himself I think.

[0:20:01] <@Menitta> I wish it was Phoenix Wright who was broken
[0:20:01] <%Feralspirit41> but when do comapanies follow atlus' model of "people can only play our games alone in a dark corner"
[0:20:12] <yusefHD> @BabyMakerNYC LUL
[0:20:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> Atlus is successful in SPITE of their marketing.

[0:23:27] <Dante_Namikaze1> Winter Soldier was super fun
[0:23:27] <%jinking79> god is that Roster ugly unbalance with Marvel hogging it
[0:23:31] <yusefHD> Pls don't walk down memory road you'll get hit by a car LUL
[0:23:38] <morphinomarshal> The roster will be forever lopsided
[0:23:44] <MKII> I hope you mod it up like sfxt lol
[0:23:46] <@Solidus_113> black panther is the function
[0:23:47] <+BabyMakerNYC> More like Sex Men. Am i rite or amirite?
[0:23:50] <morphinomarshal> But Reggie, characters are just functions
[0:23:52] <+Story_Ark> If only the game came out like a year later...
[0:23:54] <%CptnCampy61> Mvci like Gundam Wing is a complicated feeling

[0:24:08] <%Seancicle> 5 second delay
[0:24:11] <yusefHD> "next mans"
[0:24:14] <%Jack8274> X-men BibleThump
[0:24:19] <andre11dr> But then give me Loki
[0:24:20] <morphinomarshal> Boo!
[0:24:22] <morphinomarshal> Boo inhumans!
[0:24:22] <+BabyMakerNYC> X-Men are furries
[0:24:25] <Solidnick18> ughhh
[0:24:26] <+Dova573> I know the roster and arstyle sucks but I will forever defend Infinites gameplay
[0:24:28] <+Superbro64> I miss aussie Rocket doodSad
[0:24:28] <+Story_Ark> weird cause Nova isnt in any movies now or upcoming
[0:24:29] <morphinomarshal> I do like Lockjaw
[0:24:30] <@Solidus_113> never forget the adread
[0:24:31] <%jinking79> should've had Wolverine so their would had been hope for it
[0:24:35] <+kekkerscrew> as much as i love X-men they should really have their own Fighting game since there are too many
[0:24:36] <+Dova573> Best tag system
[0:24:37] <+b_aleph> InHuans are sick, stfu Woolie
[0:24:37] <+BabyMakerNYC> I bet woolie likes Static Shock.
[0:24:38] <%dreadedcthulhu> I was gna say black bolt the goat
[0:24:45] <%Malik1002> and his wife who i forget uhhhhhh red hair
[0:24:45] <@Menitta> Now I need to reinstall that 50+ gig game on my PS4
[0:24:45] <yusefHD> I am just a younnnng blaaackboooolt~~ Goooo~~oood protect meeee.
[0:24:49] <tacostarvedbeast> i cant wait to see the reactions to yakuza
[0:24:49] <morphinomarshal> If he talks people die
[0:24:59] <%Jack8274> Play some Monster Hunter World to refresh Monster Hunter Kappa
[0:25:02] <andre11dr> They didn't even give us the cool Marvel caracters, it was just everyone from MVC3 again
[0:25:03] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> The idea that capcom had no negotiating power at all is farcical. Other marvel media came out that absolutely featured the xmen.
[0:25:09] <morphinomarshal> I think Woolie will fall in love with Kuze
[0:25:10] <+kekkerscrew> just make Children of the atom 2
[0:25:12] <%ozzrabbit> Oh come on, Lockjaw was awesome! You can’t hate a teleporting pupper!
[0:25:15] <morphinomarshal> Or should I say KUZE
[0:25:17] <+Superbro64> would you bring Max in and make it a For Glory GIFT? @woolieversus
[0:25:18] <Dante_Namikaze1> Black Bolt and Ms. Marvel should've been in
[0:25:25] <%CptnCampy61> Inhumans need to be put in recycle bin live on stage
[0:25:25] <+paladinstarbuster> FUCKIN YOOOOO
[0:25:25] <+cvp5127> fate PogChamp
[0:25:28] <+Dova573> Just give me a week to remember my combos woolz
[0:25:30] <%dreadedcthulhu> f8
[0:25:31] <%Lion_kun> Woolie you shilled the Inhumans TV show on the old podcast.
[0:25:32] <+Superbro64> GIFG, excuse me
[0:25:41] <andre11dr> Gonna play that weeb shit
[0:25:41] <+jiggy_snipe> Marvel didn't force Capcom to do anything but they probably asked/suggested they focus on certain characters
[0:25:47] <%jinking79> god Vergil and Dante JACKPOT super we could've gotten
[0:26:09] <%dreadedcthulhu> wasn't it just big house and genesis?
[0:26:12] <+Deko_> literally murderers
[0:26:12] <%Feralspirit41> Man nintendo went in blasting
[0:26:13] <dan_g_v> oh no
[0:26:15] <tacostarvedbeast> curb stomped indiscriminately, it what nintendo do
[0:26:16] <@Solidus_113> time for black market tourneys
[0:26:17] <+BabyMakerNYC> Until the stigma of Child Rape is gone. GG Nintendo.
[0:26:22] <%Jack8274> EA used to be that way back in the day
[0:26:23] <%dreadedcthulhu> summit still happened last weekend
[0:26:23] <morphinomarshal> Well Melee players haven't been on their best behaviour lately
[0:26:25] <OldManDeckardCain> PATTRACK
[0:26:25] <dan_g_v> Patrick?
[0:26:26] <%Feralspirit41> Nobody was spared
[0:26:26] <+Story_Ark> the only other company that has done this before, is Nintendo
[0:26:28] <+Doppio1089> like pat
[0:26:33] <@akuda_bar> woolieSMUG incidentally that was the exact conversation that this emote comes from @Lion_kun
[0:26:37] <Blank9> just don't have tournaments until pandemic is over, that's it
[0:26:40] <yusefHD> BigBrain move is they're making a Smash Melee Anniversary for Switch
[0:26:43] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:26:46] <redrins> its not that they want you to get it its that they wouldnt care LUL
[0:26:47] <JetpackMcQuack> Pays the mortgage
[0:26:47] <+DakotaMacDoodle> Who could that be
[0:26:48] <%dreadedcthulhu> that sounds like some mango shit lmoa
[0:26:49] <morphinomarshal> He's right tho
[0:26:49] <Tooniearcade> Lol Pat
[0:26:49] <+BabyMakerNYC> He's right
[0:26:50] <tacostarvedbeast> japan doesnt understand the internet part 22
[0:26:50] <yusefHD> Nov 2021 bybee
[0:26:51] <andre11dr> Man everyone got really salty about WEWY yesterday, it was hilarious LUL
[0:26:51] <+Deko_> LUL
[0:26:51] <Prevot> LUL
[0:26:54] <MKII> LUL
[0:26:56] <morphinomarshal> Why are you booing him? He's right
[0:26:57] <DracaenaLeaf> He's right Kappa
[0:26:58] <jonasislike> OH PAT LUL
[0:26:58] <Dante_Namikaze1> Pat was right
[0:26:59] <+jiggy_snipe> well Nintendo also didn't want Melee at Evo those years ago
[0:27:03] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[0:27:03] <%Jack8274> LUL
[0:27:04] <%Malik1002> POPULATION CONTROL
[0:27:04] <+Story_Ark> NEXT BIT
[0:27:09] <%CptnCampy61> It’s not incorrect
[0:27:09] <OldManDeckardCain> NINTENDO USES DOMINION SOFTWARE
[0:27:10] <+Beniial> they need to just give up on the piracy angle: its been proven time and time again that emulation is fine
[0:27:10] <%gatorafan> Pat with the Journalist takes
[0:27:11] <+LilNatFour> psaUp
[0:27:12] <linSP> Nintendo wants to kill gamers mariaUm
[0:27:14] <@Menitta> it is kinda incorrect
[0:27:16] <mexicansunglasses> Corporations ain't your friends Woolie
[0:27:17] <@Menitta> Kinda
[0:27:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> Man is a complete idiot, but loud so who knows?
[0:27:24] <+LandOfTheWay> your resistance only makes the bit stronger
[0:27:35] <sendart> nintendon't care about your health
[0:27:35] <morphinomarshal> CommanderSqueaks clearly someone who's that loud can only be right
[0:27:44] <@Solidus_113> Nintendo doesn't care
[0:27:54] <@Menitta> They can't prove the roms were legal or not
[0:27:55] <+jiggy_snipe> you have to dump the bios, back it up yourself and can't break any drm
[0:27:58] <andre11dr> Not for Nintendo
[0:28:05] <JetpackMcQuack> Literally just do nothing Nintendo
[0:28:10] <linSP> Nintendo is ABOVE the law
[0:28:13] <+Beniial> Melee isn't sold at all anymore, so they aren't benefiting even if you buy a second hand copy
[0:28:15] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> The case law in the US leans heavily in favor of the TOs here. But the legalities don't matter.
[0:28:17] <morphinomarshal> It's not worth going to court over really
[0:28:28] <Blank9> Broadcasting a modded version is a bit beyond backing up what you own.
[0:28:31] <@akuda_bar> not with coward lawyers like that one guy who told woolie not to do the woolieS woolieT thing
[0:28:36] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> That said, a single victory would put a stop to this shit
[0:28:41] <+Doppio1089> It is not about Melee being sold, it is about the brands being used
[0:28:44] <OldManDeckardCain> nintendo just made huge buck out of losers who bought their new limited scarce products, good luck suing them rich boys LUL
[0:28:46] <@Menitta> Lmao
[0:28:47] <andre11dr> Keep in mind Nintendo aren't just run by dinosaurs but Japanese dinosaurs witch is even worst
[0:28:49] <yusefHD> I'd say to call Celino & Barnes, but one of them bois died in a plane crash
[0:28:52] <%Jack8274> Free cable? It's legal!
[0:28:55] <%ClericOfSparda> Nintendo should sell licenses to use the game rom for a tournament.
[0:28:57] <@akuda_bar> woolieF woolieU
[0:29:03] <%jinking79> don't get a tattoo with a # in it
[0:29:11] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> Sovereign citizen nonsense isn't grounded in any legalities.
[0:29:16] <$Invlux> Melee still exists Kappa just get Ultimate and only play Melee characters
[0:29:21] <morphinomarshal> Judge would tell both parties to go away and resolve the issue or come back in 6 months if you REALLY want to pursue legal action
[0:29:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> But Woolie I got the tattoo
[0:29:22] <+jiggy_snipe> yea sell the license for a nominal fee like $1
[0:29:34] <+Story_Ark> Woolie Madden: Attorney at Law
[0:29:42] <%Feralspirit41> Soverign citizenship is bullshit and im surprised it hasnt died out yet
[0:29:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> @feralspirit41 I am not.
[0:29:53] <andre11dr> OBJECTION!
[0:29:53] <%ninjanope_> ninjanope_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! 
[0:29:54] <morphinomarshal> Twitch and YouTube would NOT support the streamer, nor have they ever
[0:29:54] <yusefHD> Jesuits? PogChamp
[0:30:09] <alphalejandro> Woolie Ace Attorney
[0:30:22] <+Superbro64> That "Shut the F Up" video and the response afterwards scared you good, huh? @woolieversus
[0:30:23] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:30:26] <+jiggy_snipe> that sounds like it was the Yakuza wearing a mask
[0:30:28] <Shwepie> You mean when the yakuza showed up and said they own esports?
[0:30:35] <+Superbro64> it sucks when fans cant be fans of the thing they like
[0:30:47] <@Solidus_113> There was a quote from Iwata a long time ago, where he said something like "don't condemn fans who take your old works and find new ways to enjoy them".
[0:30:53] <Zeif00> who's gonna fuck with yakuza
[0:30:54] <@Solidus_113> I miss Iwata FeelsBadMan
[0:31:02] <%Jack8274> "Convinced" = Tojo Clan
[0:31:05] <+b_aleph> Majima owns esports
[0:31:07] <Shwepie> Iwata was a good boy.
[0:31:09] <yusefHD> Would any of this happen if the Smash community wasn't batshit insane this year though?
[0:31:15] <+Superbro64> @solidus_113 He said: "We shouldn't treat fans who love our games like criminals"
[0:31:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> Majima would be far cooler about Esports if he was.
[0:31:20] <@Solidus_113> yeah
[0:31:22] <+jiggy_snipe> it would still happen
[0:31:22] <+Superbro64> Max read a quote on stream
[0:31:22] <JetpackMcQuack> It's all up in the air
[0:31:29] <+DigitalPelican> gotta get the dinosaurs out of nintendo
[0:31:34] <+zanzibar_junker> Yo bros
[0:31:50] <+jiggy_snipe> Nintendo hates other people using emulators and mods
[0:31:53] <+LilNatFour> They basically said that PM was stopping them from supporting the scene so people removed it and then Nintendo did nothing LUL
[0:31:56] <yusefHD> Let me play as my Pikachu mapped as Ganondorf in peace tho
[0:31:56] <andre11dr> @jack8274 I mean some of the companies are straight up run by the Yakuza
[0:31:58] <Solidnick18> godzilla is in project m
[0:32:03] <Shwepie> @DigitalPelican They'll die off eventually, but they'll be replaced with new dinosaurs.
[0:32:05] <andre11dr> SEGA is at least
[0:32:08] <JetpackMcQuack> The fact that project M was mainstream was vital
[0:32:08] <$Invlux> Yakuza 8 with E-Sports management minigame
[0:32:10] <+LandOfTheWay> the takeaway lesson i'm getting here is that might (dollars) controls everything
[0:32:14] <@Menitta> LUL
[0:32:17] <+MajorCrasher> They should make it a law that if a company takes legal action against an individual, the company should have to pay for both sides' legal fees if they lose.

[0:32:27] <hamsterdavidson> the what?
[0:32:27] <yusefHD> Brawlhalla community thriving
[0:32:29] <yagirlmayalazarus> Everybody started pulling out of PM because Nintendo told them that it was the reason they were staying out of Smash stuff and then did nothing when people stopping bringing up PM lol

[0:33:05] <%Jack8274> Oh no...
[0:33:10] <+zanzibar_junker> The entertainment business is run by Yakuza because there is a cultural stigma in running entertainment because it's not honest hard work. Even during Feudal Japan.

[0:47:07] <SerRule1> Hey Woolie, so Hollywood has made some pretty bad anime remakes. At the same time, I think they're picking the wrong titles and not putting some love into it. What titles do you think would theoretically work as a hollywood remake?
[0:47:11] <%Futurecity10> Hot take iron blooded season 2 is great
[0:47:14] <andre11dr> Zeta has a bunch of teen angst bullshit in it ,but it has enough cool shit to make it worth

[0:48:37] <resloxxx> LUL
[0:48:38] <Nekros4442> ...Does Chili count as soup?

[0:48:49] <Solidnick18> it be like that
[0:48:50] <tacostarvedbeast> meat can overpower a soup though, flavor has to be balanced
[0:48:56] <fergberg75> This is true
[0:48:58] <yusefHD> what's the DEAL with SOUP~
[0:48:58] <%Jack8274> Rip french onion soup
[0:48:58] <glass_marcus> this is correct
[0:48:59] <+Dova573> See thats why you pour your own soup
[0:49:04] <+paladinstarbuster> No clam chowdah
[0:49:05] <TigerClaws12> or broth
[0:49:11] <JetpackMcQuack> 50/50
[0:49:12] <%wardogleader15> I cry

[0:57:37] <+Superbro64> all it needed to do was not be on epic LUL
[0:57:37] <CrematedCube> It's spilling over beyond gamer circles
[0:57:38] <heartlesshealer> finished version so good
[0:57:39] <+jiggy_snipe> Woolie was too early FeelsBadMan
[0:57:42] <primaryfire> playing most things in early access is shooting yourself in the foot to be honest
[0:57:44] <heartlesshealer> Asterius voice <3
[0:57:48] <CrematedCube> into artist circles and beyond
[0:57:48] <Solidnick18> hades get's goty good for them or ghost
[0:57:49] <+BigBruthaThunda> a game is more popular when it comes out
[0:57:50] <@akuda_bar> hipster
[0:57:51] <extradopeness> it’s very very good stuff but I fell off after I got Guan Yu
[0:57:56] <+jiggy_snipe> truly a hipster lol
[0:57:57] <+immortanjoestar> some of the best performances ive ever heard
[0:57:59] <%dreadedcthulhu> over hipstered
[0:58:08] <heartlesshealer> guan yu is an ass weapon, get the Fists of Gilgamesh
[0:58:09] <primaryfire> credits roll after a certain amount of wins
[0:58:11] <tacostarvedbeast> @WoolieVersus this is some weird reverse version of FOMO
[0:58:13] <%cache_22> Yes, there is an "end" with credits and everything.
[0:58:15] <+cvp5127> gotta beat it 10 times
[0:58:16] <%Jack8274> Definatly, it's a 1000% times easier with upgrades like rouge legacy
[0:58:18] <TigerClaws12> yea aspects are broken
[0:58:27] <amychibi> dear woolie have you played or heard about SOLASTA Crown of the Magister? is the best most faithfull adaptions of D&D on a videogame i have seen
[0:58:29] <%Lion_kun> Nah did it in 50 tries
[0:58:31] <redrins> it gets way easier as you go through
[0:58:38] <ZComiX> once you beat your first Loop you open up better combat
[0:58:38] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:58:43] <CrematedCube> Took 25 tries for me
[0:58:47] <linSP> I beat it on my third try idk
[0:58:50] <a_mad_dragon> i "beat" it after about 30 runs, i'm 90 runs in and NEW STUFF STILL HAPPENS
[0:58:51] <crocboyz> took 4
[0:58:55] <ScreamLord> Excalibur is pretty good
[0:58:56] <+JinjaBreadMan757> yeah them upgrades are necessary
[0:58:56] <%Lion_kun> Its way easier than dead cells
[0:59:01] <%Jack8274> It took me 8
[0:59:03] <+Jaysky> Jerma beat it on their 8th try
[0:59:05] <%Animatic_> it took me like 10 for my first clear.
[0:59:07] <heartlesshealer> Well, that's story PART 1
[0:59:10] <tacostarvedbeast> time to google what else the hades people have made
[0:59:11] <+WeirdGreg> nah these dudes LYIN
[0:59:11] <%JustYudha> ...Damn yall are so good
[0:59:13] <CrematedCube> But, when I replayed it for early access. I did it in 5
[0:59:13] <%Jetzord> I got in 29 with a busted build
[0:59:14] <+arancet> i beat it in 3 tries, but i had practice on eepic ea version
[0:59:15] <%Jack8274> But I was using a broken shield build hiding in a corner
[0:59:16] <primaryfire> I'm on 10 wins in 31 runs. highest win streak was 4
[0:59:21] <%Lion_kun> 50 for credits, 25 for first win.
[0:59:22] <CrematedCube> er, after early access
[0:59:23] <%JustYudha> I got to the end on 30ish
[0:59:24] <+Commander_Deko> hey man shadow had 10 endings you can do it

[0:59:50] <linSP> man I just don’t like grinding, even in hades
[0:59:50] <%Jack8274> The coolest thing is the boss reworks as you beat the game more and more. they change up a bunch
[0:59:52] <%Malik1002> damn that sounds like pat
[0:59:54] <+Dapper_Cactuar> It's Gungeon difficulty now instead of being hyper item reliant like Isaac
[0:59:55] <heartlesshealer> the zeus shield with support fire is insane for hiding in the corner

[1:00:40] <tacostarvedbeast> i hope hades gets a enter the gungeon level of title update support
[1:00:41] <+immortanjoestar> maybe you just suck woolie
[1:00:45] <+immortanjoestar> lmao
[1:00:54] <CrematedCube> knowing how to game the upgrade system between runs speeds things up a great deal
[1:01:03] <JetpackMcQuack> Too early
[1:01:13] <tacostarvedbeast> @WoolieVersus this is pat when he tells u how monster hunter used to be
[1:01:17] <+b_aleph> Do it Reggie vs Hades then
[1:01:26] <+jiggy_snipe> as someone said, it's a weird reverse fomo
[1:01:27] <JetpackMcQuack> Epic got you again
[1:01:31] <glass_marcus> you got the start time wrong and left the party before everyone got there
[1:01:33] <heartlesshealer> It was worth it
[1:01:33] <yusefHD> Hades is the horniest game in existence. Bonk.
[1:01:38] <+JinjaBreadMan757> All their games are quality af tho
[1:01:44] <resloxxx> Supergiants does good stuff
[1:01:47] <Blank9> how to make a game slowly and well received, unlike cyberpunk
[1:01:51] <heartlesshealer> It's greek mythology. Horny is built in

[1:02:01] <@Solidus_113> It's nice when Early Access games actually continue development and finish
[1:02:06] <%FuqBoiSlim> cyberpunk isn't out yet tho
[1:02:30] <brian_peppers1> more like a 100 times

[1:02:53] <+Dapper_Cactuar> it's more Gungeon style now than Isaac style
[1:02:57] <primaryfire> once you beat it 1-3 times you'll be making it to the final area on every run
[1:03:04] <tacostarvedbeast> mini podcast? mopcast?

[1:04:16] <@Solidus_113> Remember Vessel?
[1:04:27] <@akuda_bar> vessel who

[1:05:20] <Dante_Namikaze1> I've never heard of Vessel before
[1:05:20] <+JinjaBreadMan757> Vessel got berg'd
[1:05:21] <heartlesshealer> got hit below the waterline by Verizon
[1:05:28] <Solidnick18> cause people saw lp's before others
[1:05:29] <hajnal_endot> i also watch ltt, so vessel benefited me for multiple channels and so it was useful
[1:05:30] <extradopeness> Yeah I used Vessel to watch the DS3 LP
[1:05:35] <%cache_22> Manga vs. Anime 1.0

[1:06:01] <%Javaa01> Vessel was ad free

[1:08:03] <alphalejandro> Reg with the Tec
[1:08:26] <linSP> are we at 666 viewers
[1:08:33] <%newtypetk> but thunderbolt tho
[1:08:37] <black_pariah> i've only seen IBO
[1:08:37] <InXplotch> just chatting?
[1:08:40] <Bluewolf544> Gundam is a fuck
[1:08:46] <Bluewolf544> but worth it in the end
[1:08:51] <@Menitta> 0079 is cool as fuck
[1:08:53] <%Seancicle> Reggie, how was Umbrella Academy?
[1:08:56] <trackles_64> Like hentai?
[1:08:57] <smyld> Gundam in 60 seconds
[1:09:03] <Parapattern> But Lumber Gundam tho
[1:09:07] <Blank9> maybe g gundam
[1:09:14] <trackles_64> Bible Black XD
[1:09:15] <%newtypetk> HAMBURGER
[1:09:16] <%ozzrabbit> When is EyepatchWolf going to tie Woolie to a chair and get him to finish Hunter X Hunter?
[1:09:18] <%jinking79> not everyone like Jojo
[1:09:20] <+RowenCleric> G Gundam is for everyone though, no exceptions
[1:09:21] <hajnal_endot> you mean you don't tell all your friends to rad Onani Master Kurosawa?
[1:09:23] <+Dapper_Cactuar> Gankutsuo is great but is trippy as hell
[1:09:23] <KaironFortressKnight> agreed, on that note everyone check out Garo
[1:09:29] <+b_aleph> Everybody should check out Yuri and Friends tho
[1:09:32] <%jinking79> till the memes comes in
[1:09:34] <KaironFortressKnight> damn good timing
[1:09:41] <SerRule1> I watched Parasyte: The Maxim just recently.
[1:09:46] <+JinjaBreadMan757> 08th MS Team is a good short gundam litmus test
[1:09:48] <@Menitta> Kamen Rider is hard to get into. Wasnt a fan of Ex Aid
[1:09:51] <+OmegaWeltall> Urotsukidōji ? KappaHD
[1:10:05] <Dante_Namikaze1> Speaking of Garo they had a huge sale for all the stuff they released in the west
[1:10:08] <andre11dr> I usually really just Stardust Memories by itself, it's the best classic one, and it has none of the angst, also it's 13 episodes
[1:10:10] <CrematedCube> There's the good old 3-episode anime test
[1:10:15] <%ken_kuma> @WoolieVersus Have you and or Reggie ever watched Tatami Galaxy? It's something close to my heart and I wanted to know someone else's thoughts on it.
[1:10:19] <redrins> ex aid is so freaking good tho
[1:10:20] <Manwad> what karas movie do I check out
[1:10:22] <hajnal_endot> Onani Master Kurosawa is about a teenager who jerks it in the girls' room and it becomes this harrowing look into the nature of humanity
[1:10:24] <KaironFortressKnight> I think the best beginner Kamen Rider is Kabuto.
[1:10:30] <%newtypetk> gaim tho
[1:10:33] <ScreamLord> Reggie ever seen Big O?
[1:10:35] <PanicSwytch> @jinjabreadman757 Definitely agree. 08th MS is 12 episodes and its one of the best
[1:10:46] <@Menitta> If you wanna get into Evangelion, watch End of Evangelion and see if you like it.
[1:10:52] <Dante_Namikaze1> @kaironfortressknight Double would be the best for beginner stuff
[1:11:00] <$arcielardor> Start him on G Gundam!
[1:11:05] <%Lion_kun> War in the Pocket ie a good starter.
[1:11:07] <%psidefx> I got introduced to mecha feat heavy politics then bounced off hard
[1:11:09] <Bluewolf544> I do that too but cant help myself from recommending jojo to anyone with even a remote interest in anime
[1:11:11] <Daxalog> 6 episodes too long
[1:11:26] <jonasislike> gunbustaa

[1:13:06] <+Lewdicrus00Q> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis

[1:13:14] <@SoushinSen> i have no recollection of recommending it to Reggie.
[1:13:17] <tacostarvedbeast> what show?
[1:13:18] <OldManDeckardCain> woolie is just jealous it has a better god Kappa
[1:13:19] <%cache_22> AngriestWoolie has come to.
[1:13:20] <hajnal_endot> just watch Trapeze/Kuuchuu Buranko
[1:13:21] <Bluewolf544> Play dmc 2 - Minh
[1:13:22] <+wicketpelican> Woolie watched Crybaby dude
[1:13:22] <andre11dr> If people ask me to get into Gundam i guide them to 8 MS,War In the Pocket or 0083 Stardust Memories
[1:13:24] <+Superbro64> @soushinsen Kappa
[1:13:27] <xXButtonMasher69Xx> haru all worth it for the movie imo. Time loop was dumb tho
[1:13:28] <CrematedCube> I've never watched it, but the timeline bullshit fascinates me
[1:13:29] <%Seancicle> objection, point of order
[1:13:30] <+b_aleph> Watch Alexis Texas' I Have a Wife
[1:13:36] <Bluewolf544> @SoushinSen Kappa
[1:13:36] <%dreadedcthulhu> the push always makes it worse
[1:13:42] <TaylorIsGood> There are shows I would do that for but Haruhi is soooo far from one of those shows
[1:13:43] <hajnal_endot> trapeze is the best show
[1:13:44] <TigerClaws12> Minh didn't ask for anime consent, that's a crime
[1:13:46] <andre11dr> Watch Devil Lady
[1:13:47] <+arancet> they are random order yeah
[1:13:49] <WaifusSansFrontieres> it sucks that one piece is like, one of the best things ever but people are scared of the sheer girth
[1:13:49] <@SoushinSen> i talked about it, i don't remmber RECOMMENDING
[1:13:53] <SerRule1> Watch 'Mystic Pop-up Bar'. It's a k-drama.
[1:13:54] <Tuna_Can_0> binty ples plai dee em cee 2 bast gam
[1:13:54] <%FuqBoiSlim> I never watched Haruhi but I remember thinking Nagato was cute gwdStare
[1:13:55] <+Dova573> whats haruhi?
[1:13:59] <Bluewolf544> Devil girl cry woman
[1:14:02] <+aragaojunior> @b_aleph doodNuts
[1:14:05] <+wicketpelican> Haruhi is deep weeb shit that isn't relevant anymore due to it being a genre creator but at the same time completely average in nowadays standards.
[1:14:05] <+zanzibar_junker> Exactly
[1:14:07] <andre11dr> Devil Lady fucking rules
[1:14:09] <%Razputin217> Endless Eight inochiRip
[1:14:09] <OldManDeckardCain> just like third birthday, eh?
[1:14:11] <NeroInfinite> HAruhi is wierd they just have like theinfintie summer shit as mutiple episodes
[1:14:14] <@SoushinSen> Reggie, ythe anime you requested from me are still on the Editing PC.
[1:14:18] <tacostarvedbeast> yea nothing worse than trying to enjoy something with expectations attached. im here to relax not make you feel better about liking a thing
[1:14:21] <+arancet> @Dova573 melancholy of haruhi suzumiya or something like that
[1:14:23] <DublinRage> is KoNoSuBa low commitment?
[1:14:23] <%dreadedcthulhu> lucky star is Haruhi but good
[1:14:23] <+zanzibar_junker> LoGH Sea of the Stars is a good start
[1:14:24] <black_pariah> @SoushinSen have you ever seen Symphogear?
[1:14:25] <+Dova573> oh
[1:14:30] <@Menitta> I do remember after Mecha Week, your blanket recommendation was just watch thwe Big O
[1:14:30] <%FuqBoiSlim> @dova573 the melon-colony of Haroohi Suzy Spherehunter
[1:14:34] <Klefth> Why is it that any time they're going into a story and Minh is involved, I immeditately expect it to be some bullshit?
[1:14:35] <KaironFortressKnight> has Reggie played the DMC series out of curiosity?
[1:14:39] <%ekodrop> that movie isn't representative of the various series...
[1:14:41] <jonasislike> Macross YEYEYE
[1:14:46] <%Reverend_Roscoe> DO YOU RMEMENBER LOVE IS AWFUL
[1:14:49] <%psidefx> Had Haruhi and lucky star pushed, I only enjoyed one character then dropped both
[1:14:55] <+Jaysky> Gurren is usually a solid recommend
[1:14:56] <+wicketpelican> Try recommending Legend of the Galactic Heroes. Its crazy good but holy shit 110 episodes.
[1:14:58] <Shwepie> Wasn't Haruhi that anime that had twelve episodes that were the same episode but not really?
[1:14:58] <andre11dr> Big O is some fire shit
[1:15:00] <%ken_kuma> I think one trope that gets me into a show, specifically a shonen- is when there's a part where it's the whole squad even the B-listers against just one tough dude.
[1:15:02] <%Blazymaniac> watch one piece, just start at episode 1
[1:15:03] <jonasislike> Do you remember love is better than tv series
[1:15:06] <WaifusSansFrontieres> right this very moment I want people to play 13 sentinels, but a 30-60 hour visual novel is a HARD sell
[1:15:07] <extradopeness> Endless Waltz got me into not-G Gundam
[1:15:10] <Bluewolf544> Gurren lagaan is MUCH better when you know its influences
[1:15:14] <KaironFortressKnight> mmmm vagabond
[1:15:15] <@akuda_bar> vagabond so fuckin good tho
[1:15:17] <ScreamLord> My method is. "Hey dude, wanna check this thing out?" if they say yes "do you wanna see more of thing?" if they say no at any point "ok"
[1:15:20] <OldManDeckardCain> do you hate proper endings? read vagabond Kappa
[1:15:22] <%Reverend_Roscoe> YOU THROW SAGA AND VAGABOND AT US CONSTANTLY
[1:15:22] <PanicSwytch> I always recommend Steins Gate and Tower of God
[1:15:22] <%fritz_dacat> I gotta reread sage its been to long
[1:15:24] <+zanzibar_junker> Give someone a Gunpla
[1:15:26] <%dreadedcthulhu> I didnt get lucky star when I first watched it at 14 and rewatching it at 26 I loved it way more
[1:15:26] <+GrooovinMagic> @wicketpelican Get them to check out My Conquest is the Sea of Stars
[1:15:26] <tacostarvedbeast> woolie does it best, he plants the seed, and then 4 years later u watch legend of the galatic hero and think 'holy shit woolie was 100 percent right'
[1:15:27] <Parapattern> Big O is fucking rad, but damn they did not stick the landing on that series
[1:15:28] <@SoushinSen> Reggie, You wanted Hikaru No Go, Goblin Slayer, and I recommende Hanebado! (because ouy like sports anime)
[1:15:28] <%FuqBoiSlim> Woolie, you read Slam Dunk?
[1:15:33] <+aragaojunior> macross do you remember love doodThirst
[1:15:35] <+b_aleph> Lone Wolf and Cub > Vagabond
[1:15:37] <NeroInfinite> There isn't any test forjojo yeah
[1:15:40] <+paladinstarbuster> The OVA
[1:15:45] <That_Mojo> my test for jojo ended on part 2 newyork, rip
[1:15:46] <@Menitta> LUL The OVA
[1:15:46] <+JinjaBreadMan757> JoJo is all the way in or nothing
[1:15:47] <cholongkh> cum
[1:15:49] <+Jaysky> It's flawed
[1:15:49] <trackles_64> The first season of JoJO is ok
[1:15:50] <hajnal_endot> actually, i know a show that fails the three episode test but is sstill excellent: yurikuma arashi
[1:15:52] <%Jack8274> Everyone bounces off Jojo at first
[1:15:53] <TigerClaws12> hell yea the OVA
[1:15:53] <mihokspawn> There is a test for JoJo's ROHAN
[1:15:53] <linSP> bro just watch all of jojo
[1:15:53] <+Beniial> just hold them at gunpoint until they enjoy it
[1:15:54] <brian_peppers1> Where the fuck do I even start with JoJo?
[1:15:58] <That_Mojo> my friends tapped out there i mean
[1:15:58] <Daxalog> Have you seen the stick figure dropping a road roller? Want context? Here.
[1:15:59] <Solidnick18> yeah it's hard to determine
[1:16:02] <+Dova573> the pain of not being able to sell friends on one piece
[1:16:03] <DracaenaLeaf> the memes oversell Part 3 :(
[1:16:05] <+GrooovinMagic> @brian_peppers1 Part 1
[1:16:05] <hajnal_endot> yurikuma arashi doesn't work until episode 4
[1:16:05] <Klefth> As a JoJo fan, JoJo is hard to recommend
[1:16:07] <%Jack8274> @brian_peppers1 Part 1
[1:16:08] <Bluewolf544> Just watch Jojo you have no choice
[1:16:08] <jamesthebrave> THAT'S THE WORST
[1:16:09] <+Jaysky> I have one friend who INSISTS I NEED to watched ALL of Jojo
[1:16:10] <NeroInfinite> Show them Zepplie from part 1 and see how they feel. LUL
[1:16:12] <@Solidus_113> One Piece
[1:16:12] <%dreadedcthulhu> @brian_peppers1 part 1
[1:16:13] <+paladinstarbuster> The OVA is unironically better than part 3
[1:16:13] <OldManDeckardCain> "does this person look like they'd pose randomly in private?"
[1:16:14] <jonasislike> U can just watch phantom blood if U like that go to part 2
[1:16:14] <PKSomething> I showed a friend Part 2 to begin with and he said he would be down to see more of it
[1:16:15] <+b_aleph> @brian_peppers1 part 6
[1:16:16] <primaryfire> the game gets good 25 hours in bro
[1:16:17] <andre11dr> My test is watch the first episode of Part 2 and if you love it YOUR IN
[1:16:19] <KaizaMcBold> eben they Like the pants Ther in
[1:16:20] <JetpackMcQuack> Araki's good at boiling the frog
[1:16:22] <Parapattern> The art style of JoJo makes me sick to my stomach. I don't know why.
[1:16:22] <KaironFortressKnight> dude get to season 3
[1:16:23] <%psidefx> Jojo either your in or you're not
[1:16:27] <tacostarvedbeast> hunter x hunter took 14 episodes to really kick in for me
[1:16:29] <@Menitta> I'm like that with Nier Automata. The first 15 hours are kinda boring imo
[1:16:30] <NeetKiller> I felt that way about HxH
[1:16:31] <ScreamLord> Episode 8 WutFace
[1:16:31] <Zeif00> it happens
[1:16:31] <heartlesshealer> people tried to get my best friend into Jojo too fucking soon and spoiled the hell out of it and now he doesn't want to read/watch it at all. ;___;
[1:16:33] <%Seancicle> OSFrog
[1:16:33] <@Menitta> but the last 35 tho
[1:16:36] <Klefth> YOU HEAR THAT ONE PIECE FANS?
[1:16:38] <+Deko_> i got a friend into jojo by making them watch the abridged part 1+2
[1:16:39] <Clundy> It’s the equivalent of “Oh FFX111 gets so good after hour 80!@“
[1:16:43] <Wind_Burst> HxH is the ultimate "just get to chimera ant"
[1:16:44] <WaifusSansFrontieres> @WoolieVersus can you fault people that drop gurren at episode 4?
[1:16:51] <%LCLSmoothie> LCLSmoothie subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 2 month streak! woolie time
[1:16:51] <%ekodrop> with some stuff it's more like until it gets to that part things don't make sense
[1:16:52] <jonasislike> ENNIS LOBBY THO
[1:16:54] <+Dova573> Nah woolie even actual HxH dosent get good till after the beggining is done
[1:16:58] <OldManDeckardCain> I SWEAR FF1
[1:17:00] <jamesthebrave> The opposite of that feeling is when somebody is watching a thing you really like and they ask you "Hey so when does this get good" PAIN
[1:17:03] <$arcielardor> For Reggie, wasn't there some kind of Foot stand in part 4?
[1:17:04] <KaironFortressKnight> automata is a hard recommend cuz of that
[1:17:04] <JetpackMcQuack> People are busy
[1:17:05] <+PapaGravestone> i told my wife about darling in the franxx back when it was good. i apologize to her often. redeemed myself by getting her into gurren laggan and gridman though.
[1:17:07] <+Qsmash_> the second episode of 90's HxH added filler
[1:17:15] <%jinking79> Stein gate has that problem too
[1:17:15] <jonasislike> HXH 1999 had some dumb fillers
[1:17:16] <%FuqBoiSlim> One Piece twitter stans are weirdoes you can watch 100 episode, say you didn't like it and they'll say "You didn't watch enough bro"
[1:17:17] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @OldManDeckardCain
[1:17:19] <+JinjaBreadMan757> Even the new series of Hunter x Hunter took me til they got to the "fight" with the prisoners before i was like Ohhhhhh
[1:17:22] <WaifusSansFrontieres> what do you gyus mean? if you read the manga one piece is good from the start
[1:17:34] <+Jaysky> There's a lot of shows where it only takes 1-2 eps
[1:17:35] <+Dova573> Hxh Weakest part is the beginning manga or anime wise
[1:17:38] <glass_marcus> All of one piece is good, ALL OF IT
[1:17:42] <andre11dr> HxH fucking draaaags till it gets to the tournament
[1:17:50] <Bluewolf544> JOJO technically needs you to get to part 2
[1:17:51] <+zanzibar_junker> Robot anime is the fighting games of anime
[1:17:52] <NeroInfinite> They hype killed KLK for me.
[1:17:55] <WaifusSansFrontieres> @FuqBoiSlim because of bad anime pacing, yeah
[1:17:59] <+Dova573> Yeah bleach starts strong
[1:18:02] <brian_peppers1> Bleached tricked us all
[1:18:04] <OldManDeckardCain> what
[1:18:05] <%fritz_dacat> hallow
[1:18:05] <Prevot> bleach was never good
[1:18:07] <+zooeymainbtw> bleach has a strong thesis statement
[1:18:08] <+arancet> bleach at start is great
[1:18:08] <JetpackMcQuack> Worked on me
[1:18:09] <mihokspawn> Angler
[1:18:13] <jamesthebrave> The first arc and Soul Society arc are SUPER GOOD
[1:18:18] <OldManDeckardCain> it wasn't a big one LUL
[1:18:18] <nimu290> bleach was cool until it wasn't
[1:18:19] <Klefth> @glass_marcus Yes, nothing like having a fucking announcer spend over 10 minutes of an episode monologuing about flashbacks or some shit
[1:18:19] <andre11dr> I have never seen Bleach
[1:18:21] <%dreadedcthulhu> new bleach has that same effect (jujutsu kaisen)
[1:18:24] <TigerClaws12> LUL
[1:18:26] <%Jack8274> We all love Soul Society, then it kept going
[1:18:28] <Prevot> I researched early bleach a while ago and that shit sucked from the start
[1:18:30] <redrins> grand fisher
[1:18:31] <CrematedCube> Bleach started solid but lost focus
[1:18:31] <resloxxx> LUL
[1:18:31] <+Jaysky> Naruto nearly gets his ass killed
[1:18:32] <Dante_Namikaze1> it was just a Hollow
[1:18:33] <RunoEddie> I wouldn't say the beginning of HxX drags, at least the manga, it just isn't the 11 out of 10 that later parts get
[1:18:39] <jamesthebrave> Y'know what are surprisingly great? The Bleach anime movies. Good shit all round.
[1:18:39] <%ken_kuma> We live in a Soul Society
[1:18:42] <%Gasgrave> Why not force Ergo Proxy on someone? It's easy to get into.
[1:18:42] <%fritz_dacat> Now go watch Konosuba
[1:18:47] <hajnal_endot> we adult swim in here
[1:18:48] <%dreadedcthulhu> my threshold is usually 3
[1:18:51] <@Solidus_113> Soul Eater takes 4 episodes to introduce the characters
[1:18:51] <PanicSwytch> The Bount saga suuuuuucks
[1:18:54] <OldManDeckardCain> bleach pre soul society was the best, CHANGE MY MIND
[1:18:56] <300coolfactsaboutbears> Time to shill HxH.
[1:18:59] <%Jack8274> The best Bleach is "Bleach: Dark Souls"
[1:18:59] <+Jaysky> Ergo Proxy is NOT easy to get into what the hell
[1:18:59] <+zooeymainbtw> don't watch bleach filler
[1:19:06] <%PkSilent01> !sechdule

[1:19:12] <%ekodrop> damn reggie is patient
[1:19:13] <Bluewolf544> PogChamp
[1:19:13] <RunoEddie> Gintama takes more than 20 episodes to become amazing lmao
[1:19:15] <+Deko_> its too good
[1:19:16] <+johnny_gogo> me and my friend had to watch upto like 6 or 7 on demon slayer before it grabed us
[1:19:27] <+cvp5127> 6 is too much
[1:19:29] <jonasislike> The bleach live action is definite bleach experience
[1:19:31] <hajnal_endot> anyway, Kuuchuu Buranko is about an insane psychiatrist and his normal patients and is an incredibly in-depth and sympathetic portrayal of mental health issues
[1:19:33] <%Gasgrave> That's the joke
[1:19:33] <%newtypetk> can we put reggie on the Thunderbolt section tho?
[1:19:42] <WaifusSansFrontieres> I read one piece twice
[1:19:51] <linSP> pat hates the dip

[1:19:52] <a_mad_dragon> episode 4 frightened me, i thought they had blown their budget on the first three episodes and 4 was what the rest would be like
[1:19:53] <+zanzibar_junker> Gaogaigar has the best gattai sequence in all of anime
[1:19:54] <resloxxx> The time skip Kreygasm
[1:19:56] <hajnal_endot> and it never got licensed because there is no justice
[1:19:58] <%baka_sugoi> too much weeb stuff

[1:20:06] <brian_peppers1> A buffet of mediocrity
[1:20:10] <+zanzibar_junker> Final Fusion is iconic

[1:20:39] <nimu290> fell
[1:20:40] <@akuda_bar> understand, understand
[1:20:43] <andre11dr> Yu Yu Hakusho starts out pretty mediocre and then it becomes ",holy shit" But you gotta get past the shit
[1:20:49] <%fritz_dacat> Now get into Webcomics
[1:20:55] <+Jaysky> @johnny_gogo I only started to care when they introduced the demon lord guy in the city. Before then it felt generic as hell.

[1:21:00] <+zanzibar_junker> Watch Votoms
[1:21:01] <NeroInfinite> I got into harmeanime via thatreverseharemanime that came out earlier in theyear.
[1:21:01] <@SoushinSen> Reggie, did oyu end up watching 1 Liter of Tears?
[1:21:08] <jamesthebrave> Having shit going on really makes me appreciate long ass JRPGs. It's nice to be able to come back to the same story and characters for a while to have fun for a bit. Instead of having to jump between a bunch of different ones cuz they're all super short.
[1:21:09] <+zooeymainbtw> BUT DEATH NOTE THO?
[1:21:11] <%dklordg> YOU HAVENT SEEN DEATH NOTE?
[1:21:12] <agianttornado> My buddy thought that Megalobox 1st episode was too slow, how do I help convvince him when something is only 10-12 epsisodes? @WoolieVersus
[1:21:13] <Klefth> YOU!? YOU haven't seen Death Note!? @WoolieVersus

[1:21:36] <+GrooovinMagic> I'm more jealous when someone tells me they've never seen a show I love.

[1:21:46] <RunoEddie> I understand perfectly where Woolie is coming from, I really do, time is the most precious resource that exists, but it does end up sometimes filtering out the incredibly amazing slow burns

[1:41:39] <Prevot> I did the galaxy 1 version of this where you use bob-ombs and it was fucking bullshit
[1:41:44] <%skyheys> "this is bullshit!" -half his fireballs hit nothing
[1:41:48] <glass_marcus> the amount of fire balls you throw isn't important, the angle and position is what you need to focus on
[1:41:52] <%xcompleasedad> @WoolieVersus You have penetrating shots. I think
[1:41:53] <exnuart> the fireball goes through all them
[1:41:54] <@Menitta> Galaxy 1 had the trash bob omb one
[1:41:57] <ShiningAxis> try going to the side and firing in lines
[1:42:03] <%skyheys> @lots__ yep, it was even worse
[1:42:05] <alphalejandro> @LotS__ Yes, but it was with bombs i believe
[1:42:07] <missingangle> I feel like the bob omb one is worse imo
[1:42:10] <SuperRafiMan> Gotta angle yourself
[1:42:25] <%skyheys> Why does he throw like ten?
[1:42:28] <@Menitta> That was close
[1:42:44] <%xcompleasedad> Don't spam shots. You have penetration @WoolieVersus
[1:42:44] <andrewofbob> Get to one side and wipe it
[1:42:47] <%skyheys> Yes.
[1:42:56] <CrematedCube> That 2P smash can seriously help in the last second pinch
[1:42:59] <Prevot> they go through the boxes tho
[1:43:01] <BlackermanZX> friggin boxes doodWat
[1:43:06] <%skyheys> One spin hits the whole line
[1:43:08] <exnuart> 1 spin
[1:43:12] <exnuart> you don't need 3
[1:43:14] <Wind_Burst> don't spam fireballs in the same direction to save time
[1:43:16] <+starzo0> @starzo0 it'll prob drop down to like ten bucks next steam sale if youre on pc, coulnd tell you about console, but i bet it be similar
[1:43:17] <CrematedCube> They pierce
[1:43:21] <EliahNebb> this is like minesweeper
[1:43:26] <+Commander_Deko> the balls pierce you don't need to keep spamming them

[1:43:38] <PhantomMaskJr> DMC challenges < Mario challenges larxaLurk
[1:43:40] <exnuart> balls are piercing shots

[1:54:48] <%emperordread> Protip for scammers: Tell them to send anything in wrting since your hearing is bad. Never hear from em again
[1:55:01] <+seoliart> Literally 80% of calls I receive nowadays are just robocalling scams

[1:56:27] <%LCLSmoothie> the scammers ive encountered in person is when dudes try to give you their mixtapes for free and then ask for a tip in hollywood blvd
[1:56:29] <+Jaysky> @fuqboislim The robo calls usually lead to the human callers
[1:56:39] <Tuna_Can_0> MrDestructoid only robo callers ever
[1:56:40] <+Beniial> I like how the luma just forms an orderly queue with the clouds
[1:57:04] <+Jaysky> Yeah cause lumas are polite Lil fellas
[1:57:07] <@akuda_bar> Jim Browning is super good too, he has videos where he got into the webcam of the scammer's office and is literally watching the guy while he's on the phone
[1:57:11] <%FuqBoiSlim> @jaysky is that right? I usually hang up as soon i hear that fake ass "Hello?"
[1:57:12] <heartlesshealer> one day we will align shadows
[1:57:57] <+starzo0> aligning shadows is actually hard for me sometimes
[1:57:59] <@Menitta> @akuda_bar Holy shit I need this
[1:58:21] <+Jaysky> @fuqboislim Yeah they use it as a means to wade through gullible people, or the message threatens people and tells em to call THIS number or stay on the line to resolve x problem
[1:58:24] <exnuart> jumping on goombas gives coins if i remember
[1:58:30] <aru42> jump on enemies and they'll give coins!
[1:58:36] <CrematedCube> You need to stomp enemies to get coins from them
[1:58:43] <CrematedCube> spins don't count
[1:58:47] <SideChar> spinning the Goombas will give star bits. jumping on them will give coins
[1:58:54] <glass_marcus> ^^^
[1:59:18] <Zebroneath> gotta stomp on the goombas for coins, not spin
[1:59:43] <+FuqBoiSlim> Idk anyone told you yet but stomping on enemies will give you coins
[1:59:49] <ScreamLord> So about those anti-scammer forums
[2:00:25] <CrematedCube> Some of these lumas make you really scum for coins
[2:00:27] <NotHereToStream> furnish them with information Kappa
[2:01:07] <+jiggy_snipe> sometimes they also get scammed
[2:01:12] <+starzo0> the trenches of the call center
[2:01:20] <+Jaysky> Jim Browning did that for one place, although I dunno about the forced labor bit
[2:01:38] <+jiggy_snipe> some of those call centers have legit operations and on a different floor is the scam operation
[2:01:42] <@akuda_bar> yeah JIm Browning's Spying on the Scammers series is fucking cool
[2:01:44] <exnuart> reggie getting rid of all the coins
[2:01:52] <@Menitta> hOW DID THAT MIS
[2:02:00] <@akuda_bar> he's literally looking at the guy's pc over his shoulder on a security camera while the guy scams him
[2:02:38] <@Menitta> There's a ground pound on the high hats
[2:02:38] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:02:58] <@akuda_bar> they still waste the time because the time they waste with you means they can't spend it on an actual victim

[2:13:49] <CrematedCube> Sound like Texas rain, except as snow
[2:13:50] <%LCLSmoothie> los angeles winter is just 50 F days with foggy days haha
[2:14:11] <%FuqBoiSlim> I hate snow because it always makes everything bright af in the mornings
[2:14:56] <+Jaysky> My city has no clue what it wants to do. First it was summer weather, then it flash snowed, then it was freezing tem0s, then summer for 3 weeks.

[2:24:57] <CrematedCube> PTSD flashbacks of the handheld Sonic special levels
[2:25:05] <300coolfactsaboutbears> He's got a buddy at the end to "take care" of Mario once he gets his money.

[2:25:51] <BlackermanZX> Rooftop Run?
[2:25:54] <@akuda_bar> there used to be a store in massachusetts called Spags and it always sounded a little rude
[2:25:55] <%dreadedcthulhu> probably rooftop run?
[2:25:58] <SomersaultJustice> I have a variant but I don't want to say it
[2:25:59] <Self_esteampunk> that opening cinematic tho
[2:26:00] <passserby> the Result E music is the best thing sonic unleashed brought
[2:26:07] <%ChoculaUltra> werehog? did I walk into another sonic discussion
[2:26:09] <notsoy> even the shittiest sonics have had at least a few bangers
[2:26:14] <EliahNebb> amazing how anyone can say 'werehog' without laughing
[2:26:18] <Self_esteampunk> I actually like the werehog levels
[2:26:22] <%LCLSmoothie> that jazz battle music was something
[2:26:28] <@Menitta> Sonic Unleashed is a remnant of the era where LITERALLY EVERY SERIES tried to do God of War
[2:26:32] <+starzo0> @notsoy the theme from seven rings is my shit
[2:26:50] <Prevot> and now not even God of War is doing God of War
[2:26:58] <%Josef_Stryker> I have a soft spot for Unleashed

[2:27:30] <%FuqBoiSlim> Do you someone tried to make a Sonic Unleashed Werehog combo MAD back in 2008 and they just couldn't...
[2:27:39] <BlackermanZX> Werehog would have been slightly better without having these long ass levels
[2:27:47] <BlackermanZX> and that goddamn repetitive battle song
[2:27:51] <@Menitta> Even Castlevania tried to God of War

[2:28:41] <+Jaysky> He'll, Unleashed was basically two games from Wii to 360/ps3
[2:28:45] <Cynical_Canadian> Having a 2nd player REALLY helps here, wow
[2:28:47] <+Jaysky> *Hell
[2:28:52] <aru42> the double line aint bad if you get off it quickly
[2:28:53] <+Beniial> Mario's my favorite Smash spinoff, up there with Fire Emblem
[2:29:03] <@Menitta> I played Unleashed on Wii so I have more positive memories of that game
[2:29:10] <glass_marcus> Between both versions of unleashed there is an actually good game there
[2:29:19] <Cynical_Canadian> You just die if you don't get 100, Gold Rosalina popped up when I did this level
[2:29:35] <%FuqBoiSlim> Hey when is that Captain Falcon dude gonna get his own game?
[2:29:38] <BlackermanZX> i played the ps2 version first and then the 360 and holy shit its so different
[2:29:41] <300coolfactsaboutbears> Sonic Colors on the DS was better than Colors on the Wii.

[2:31:40] <300coolfactsaboutbears> They are unfeeling machines.
[2:31:47] <+Jaysky> Fuck Eggmanland (it looked cool tho)
[2:32:30] <%FuqBoiSlim> I dont think I got past Holaska on either version of the game tbh. which is weird cause 8 year old me loved sonic

[2:32:38] <andrewofbob> Greed
[2:32:45] <+firmlygraspi1> I wish you could make these slides in Mario Maker
[2:32:50] <Cynical_Canadian> Eggmanland was terrible in both the Ps3/Xbox and Wii/PS2 versions
[2:33:00] <+Jaysky> I remember wanting to chuck my controller eggmanland
[2:33:08] <+Jaysky> *at
[2:33:20] <big_booty_animemilf> SO TIGHT
[2:33:25] <cache_22> Style points though.
[2:33:27] <+Jaysky> Holaska I think was fun? Sand level was dope
[2:33:50] <+Jaysky> Good music overall especially the final boss but that's par for the Sonic course
[2:33:57] <+LotS__> "Nice work!" *pulls out gun*
[2:34:05] <+kewlmyc> "Do better next time". *gunshot*
[2:34:09] <mothdude> There should be a really cool level at the Space Storm Galaxy I think
[2:34:09] <andrewofbob> Feeds Mario a bullet bill

[2:36:00] <%ChoculaUltra> there's a new yoshi game?!
[2:36:09] <Cynical_Canadian> Reggie clutching it out for Woolie
[2:36:24] <@Menitta> Yoshi's Island DS has issues of needing to switch babies constantly
[2:36:28] <Prevot> Yoshi's Wooly World was way better than the DS one IMO
[2:36:38] <@Menitta> Woolly World is great
[2:36:41] <SomersaultJustice> wooly world was better than both ds games
[2:36:59] <300coolfactsaboutbears> And tiny wario.
[2:37:13] <Prevot> the switch yoshi game was okay, but it didn't hit me like wooly world
[2:37:33] <Cynical_Canadian> This game loves the Oniel Cylinder, at least that's what I think these are supposed to be

[2:51:14] <@Menitta> The fights against the koopa kids in 3 and world are fights

[2:52:22] <CrematedCube> The sound of novocaine
[2:52:24] <300coolfactsaboutbears> @th3smartalec Honestly this is preferable.
[2:52:38] <CrematedCube> I've heard that and it's great

[2:55:49] <+starzo0> the cube can smell fear
[2:55:56] <nailwind> the cube is sacred, one wrong touch spells death
[2:56:15] <300coolfactsaboutbears> "Well I'm burning to death in the lava, might as well feed myself to the hippo."
[2:56:35] <@Menitta> Its a very specific fear
[2:56:52] <exnuart> Tarzan made hippos cute
[2:57:11] <+firmlygraspi1> they're one of the top man killers in nature
[2:57:18] <AnneSQF> it's their chubby faces
[2:57:24] <+LotS__> Hippos are not chill lol
[2:57:25] <ShiningAxis> hippos are living tanks
[2:57:30] <+CelebrityGhost> they don't have any sharp parts. They look like big water cows
[2:57:37] <%Charbic> Just look at their skulls
[2:57:38] <shinichizio> It's all crushing damage.

[2:58:02] <CrematedCube> This music sounds right at home with the Gurren soundtrack, such a badass astronauts' march
[2:58:03] <+kewlmyc> That's a weird fetish, Woolie
[2:58:03] <300coolfactsaboutbears> It's a trash compressor.
[2:58:03] <heartlesshealer> they have a lot of power
[2:58:03] <%psidefx> Can't be unheard
[2:58:09] <Prevot> I gotta say, having played the 3D All Stars collection recently, those square poles are a massive improvement over 64 and Sunshine

[2:59:07] <%FroggoPrince> nevermind being that close to lava, that man would be bacon irl
[2:59:15] <300coolfactsaboutbears> Earthquakes are just the lava hippos unleashing their gaseous rage.
[2:59:25] <Mangahero18> Hippos are absolutely NOT chill. They are one of the most territorial creatures in nature. Super deadly. Though they still only kill like 500 people a year.

[3:01:43] <That_Mojo> @Cynical_Canadian this
[3:02:13] <@Menitta> I thought you could unlock Luigi to be playable any time at some point
[3:02:16] <%jinking79> that Tarzan movie show how violent they r
[3:02:20] <300coolfactsaboutbears> Polar bear is the largest living land predator, but Hippo still probably wins.
[3:02:23] <%PkSilent01> @Menitta after you beat the game
[3:02:34] <@Menitta> Ah ok
[3:03:03] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Thank you, 300coolfactsaboutbears. That was a cool fact.

[4:09:12] <Prevot> as miyamoto once said, hentai games are bullshit cause they say try not to cum but the whole point is you want to cum
[4:09:12] <%FuqBoiSlim> Its on an "HD Wii" :)
[4:09:13] <Darren716> Yeah you can pretty easily get your final 6 just in world 6
[4:09:13] <%SegaDSi> Cool, Next sesssion with be the thing
[4:09:14] <+N0bdyNoOne> I am labbing my cookie clicker game atm
[4:09:19] <BlackermanZX> twewy is gonna need a tutorial
[4:10:10] <%Asuterisuku> There's no way Reggie hasn't seen the thing by now.
[4:10:51] <giogio346> @WoolieVersus the framerate of the game looked kinda chunky.. idk if its the game or the stream?
[4:10:54] <@akuda_bar> how does it feel to be less powerful than your computer
[4:11:00] <Mangahero18> I just got back from the kitchen. Is the stream ending?
[4:11:20] <%Asuterisuku> Multiscreen setups are underrated.
[4:12:37] <@Menitta> One day he will defeat the Absolute Unit 01
[4:12:38] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:13:29] <Afterman_> the kotor videos i think? he has to use the stream vid instead of the yt version
[4:13:31] <%emperordread> "I am protecting you from the pain of redoing a task again" > Sets Reggie up for Demons Souls LUL <3
[4:13:57] <@Menitta> Hoarding consoles and games is fun
[4:14:05] <%Josef_Stryker> I super regret selling some of my games
[4:14:11] <%Asuterisuku> I got my Wii on launch day and it slowly died over the course of ten years.
[4:14:18] <%Josef_Stryker> Like when I sold my original copy of Twilight Princess
[4:14:20] <BlackermanZX> i miss my 360
[4:14:21] <%Asuterisuku> First the disc drive went, then the hard drive.
[4:14:22] <@Menitta> I sold a few of my GBA games and that was the worst
[4:14:23] <@SoushinSen> my parents sent my NES to vietnam
[4:14:24] <%Josef_Stryker> I did buy it back
[4:14:33] <%Jetzord> That happened to me, but it was Bangladesh
[4:14:36] <%Asuterisuku> Luckily I was able to transfer all my licenses to my Wii U.
[4:14:38] <%Irridium> MY PARENTS SOLD MY FUCKING GAMECUBE AND I AM STILL STALTY ABOUT IT
[4:14:50] <nailwind> that NES seen 'nam
[4:15:01] <yeildingthought> LUL
[4:15:07] <Darren716> LUL

[4:15:36] <jorniev> my ps one got stolen after sell it too my cousins for not nearly as much money
[4:15:37] <%emperordread> Your Christmas gift? Our Christmas gift
[4:15:42] <Meltgar> @WoolieVersus As a kid, did you parents ever took your shit and never told you? and they just say "Oh we gave it away"
[4:16:00] <misterurbanthelegend> Now no ones happy.
[4:16:12] <%ozzrabbit> But they can’t use it in those countries. US systems are not compatible with PAL!
[4:16:31] <%Asuterisuku> Vietnam isn't PAL.
[4:16:52] <@akuda_bar> oh my god yeah, wouldn't that be easier
[4:16:57] <AnneSQF> just talk?

[4:17:25] <+jiggy_snipe> you did
[4:17:27] <+N0bdyNoOne> What?
[4:17:32] <DrJamesWoods> you changed it
[4:17:34] <+N0bdyNoOne> IT said mario galaxy 2 the whole time
[4:17:37] <+N0bdyNoOne> That's why I am here :p
[4:17:40] <+Burnt_Pixels> 7 raiders from Burnt_Pixels have joined! 
[4:17:42] <+jiggy_snipe> just talk was a reference to your parents
[4:17:44] <%Jetzord> nah, you're good Woolie
[4:17:52] <%Asuterisuku> Late raid.
[4:17:54] <%Jack8274> You changed it
[4:18:13] <AnneSQF> it says you are playing Galaxy on my end
[4:18:16] <@akuda_bar> a what, a foogoo?

[4:19:53] <Darren716> I wonder if there's like a clan of machete men
[4:20:03] <Darren716> They stole the number too?
[4:20:30] <%Jetzord> That's why my mom always brought a shit ton of suitcases or sent it with other people. We Bengalis got our shit covered
[4:20:40] <townzzzzz> put your family crest on curb
[4:20:48] <misterurbanthelegend> Machete Man: The second barrel.
[4:21:04] <@Menitta> "You sent me a PS4 with Killzone Shadowfall?!"
[4:21:11] <@akuda_bar> how could he not know the machete man

[4:22:28] <%Jack8274> That’s horrifying as fuck
[4:22:35] <Darren716> I don't know why but calling it a cutlas instead of a machete just makes the story better
[4:22:36] <misterurbanthelegend> Some fuckin Jump too.

[4:22:47] <linSP> woolie met a pirate man?
[4:23:11] <jorniev> serously fuck the cops
[4:23:12] <Mangahero18> At this point Machete Man is more of a character than Liam in the SBF ethos.
[4:23:25] <Meltgar> Machete man is for the Woolie Lore Book
[4:23:36] <Darren716> I wonder if machete man is still alive
[4:23:43] <Darren716> Like what's he up to these days?
[4:23:47] <Vaardvark> did he ever come back?
[4:23:47] <jorniev> he is probably dead no
[4:23:48] <@Menitta> He's gonna come back eventually
[4:23:50] <Meltgar> @Darren716 Probably lost VS Revolver Man
[4:23:51] <Mangahero18> The ultimate edition has Machete Man in silver on the cover.
[4:23:53] <nailwind> ghetto Robin Hood
[4:23:54] <Coconosuga> Oof
[4:23:56] <Vaardvark> he's on his way
[4:24:03] <@akuda_bar> cutlass makes him sound like a pirate
[4:24:04] <+N0bdyNoOne> Can we commission you a comeback picture?
[4:24:06] <@akuda_bar> but i guess he is a pirate
[4:24:08] <AShinyVagikarp> monkaS
[4:24:12] <YakumoYomi> Machete Man is the storm that is approaching
[4:24:13] <Darren716> If he comes back can we have him on the podcast?
[4:24:16] <BlackermanZX> doodWat
[4:24:19] <Mangahero18> He's gonna come back...ON THE DAY YOU DIE.
[4:24:24] <Mangahero18> DUM DUM DUUUUM

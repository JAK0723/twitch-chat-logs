[0:03:20] <%ghoulspan> whats up chat have a seat over there
[0:03:24] <Ozavic> @InXplotch From what I've been told this one stands out
[0:03:25] <redginger666> Let's go
[0:03:34] <redginger666> Murder live in stream
[0:03:41] <%CursedNobleman> kirby superstar is the best kirby. fight me
[0:03:42] <Ozavic> I should really play through P3
[0:03:55] <+projectmanatees> do it
[0:03:57] <%CursedNobleman> @Ozavic its fun aside from the gameplay LUL
[0:03:58] <bashful_bard> P3P is really good
[0:04:02] <%Superdandy96> @cursednobleman I can only up that with Kirby SuperStar Ultra
[0:04:03] <nothuzad> any bets on if reggie just quits from stress this session?
[0:04:14] <%CursedNobleman> @Superdandy96 i consider it the same game LUL
[0:04:15] <%Amaideus> If he didn't before he won't yet
[0:04:16] <+projectmanatees> bet ken is the worst
[0:04:28] <jubejube56> Can't wait for the dokapon kingdom story mode second gig right after this play through ends.
[0:04:30] <redstrawherring> Too much sacrificed in P3P to recommend
[0:04:31] <%Superdandy96> Touché
[0:04:31] <+Mendin> There's actual odds that tonight could be The End Of Dokavangelion
[0:04:33] <treacherously_> Got some hash rosin ready for this
[0:04:33] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1260094696292048899
[0:04:36] <Ozavic> I REALLY want to play P4G but I don't want to buy a vita / pstv just for one game
[0:04:38] <%iswearimjustdandy> @superdandy96 youre right and you should say it
[0:04:51] <%CursedNobleman> @Ozavic same here
[0:04:57] <%Amaideus> Them all going crazy to go to hell at the end of last session was super unexpected
[0:05:04] <%Amaideus> We'll see who runs it back this time
[0:05:16] <Ozavic> @CursedNobleman Hope we get a PS5 version?
[0:05:17] <%Solidnick18> yo
[0:05:18] <+deliciousmocha> how is this game not finished yet
[0:05:21] <%Solidnick18> SourPls
[0:05:28] <+deliciousmocha> how much longer must the suffering last?
[0:05:29] <bashful_bard> Takes too much time to retake all those towns
[0:05:41] <%C4m3r0n0409> YO
[0:05:48] <%nintega010> @deliciousmocha they keep delaying each other and they all want to win
[0:05:48] <%C4m3r0n0409> MY HERO
[0:05:50] <treacherously_> As much ish as woolie got this lp, he really has pushed the objectives
[0:05:51] <%iswearimjustdandy> Wait who took zubaz in the divorce.
[0:05:51] <%CursedNobleman> i only have nintendo consoles and PC LUL. the rate their going i might end up e******** it
[0:06:22] <%C4m3r0n0409> I hope they kill eachother
[0:06:25] <%Superdandy96> If we’re playing anime intros, when’s that Beastar into Woolz? That furry jazz will never stop!
[0:06:41] <%C4m3r0n0409> Beastars intro is meh
[0:06:43] <+Mendin> here's hoping Woolie and Reggie remember the lesson they learned a bit late at the end of the last season (beat up Minh and take his stuff)
[0:06:48] <%paladinstarbuster> The blood pool comes with a free N-Pass
[0:06:49] <%big_oki> almost finalie
[0:06:52] <momo25247> Bloo?
[0:06:57] <momo25247> D
[0:06:59] <RamenRiderZ> Dokapon Apocalypse? Does the Behelit finally come to play?
[0:07:00] <WG101> WE'RE IN THE ENDGAME NOW
[0:07:00] <%CursedNobleman> can i trade my jap pass for an N-pass?
[0:07:03] <jubejube56> Wild Side is a pretty nice tune
[0:07:03] <ExileNineteen> @Mendin LUL learning lessons LUL
[0:07:05] <treacherously_> Yea he’s an ez gank
[0:07:11] <Milo_Oda> i came for the apocalypse SwiftRage
[0:07:17] <Aydarkzero> so here we are again
[0:07:29] <Ozavic> The music is better than the visuals, but the claymation is super impressive
[0:07:31] <%ekodrop> reggie gonna set us back again when he goes darkling
[0:07:34] <%bread_assassin> Now, this HAS to be the last session right?
[0:07:44] <crossing_mao> Into the hole we goooooo!!!
[0:07:47] <bashful_bard> Minh really won't have any advantage once woolie gets a shield
[0:07:47] <WG101> @bread_assassin most likely
[0:07:52] <Ozavic> @bread_assassin No, you can delay for a very long time
[0:07:56] <%CursedNobleman> @bread_assassin one step forward. 3/4 of a step back?
[0:07:59] <%SuperKirby24> yeyeye
[0:08:04] <jubejube56> I mean the only one in Heck is Woolie and he is shieldless and spinner-less
[0:08:07] <treacherously_> The woolie hole is the 9th circle of heck
[0:08:08] <aiutare47> What arc we in now?
[0:08:09] <%Superdandy96> I don’t hear the eva music so it looks like we’re probably gonna have... one more session maybe?
[0:08:15] <jubejube56> Minh still has a huge magic weakness
[0:08:16] <Hammatime8> I'm a few whole VODs behind, so I don't think I'll be cathcing this live :/
[0:08:23] <%kingkeldeo31> I missed the last stream, who is in Heck currently?
[0:08:27] <Augus7717> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[0:08:28] <%Solidnick18> we are in the KILL MINH arc
[0:08:28] <Hammatime8> Y'all have fun, I'll see ya in the VOD
[0:08:29] <WG101> @kingkeldeo31 only woolie
[0:08:32] <zipperdude33> The dokapocalypse begins
[0:08:35] <Ozavic> @aiutare47 Hell Training arc
[0:08:37] <%SuperKirby24> unrelated, but keef crew is a fucking blessing LUL
[0:08:39] <jubejube56> @kingkeldeo31 Just woolie, but Minh has the only passport
[0:08:50] <%gatorafan> Determination time!
[0:08:50] <%CursedNobleman> more like the bitchford retreival arc
[0:08:52] <treacherously_> Woolies chillin in heck
[0:08:53] <%emperordread> emperordread subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Started a story mode of Dokapon myself today against bots thinking with all the knowledge from this stream that I'd nail it. I spent the first 3 months getting destroyed and learning new appreciation for y'all and this legendary LP. #Bloodpool #TeamReggie
[0:08:54] <%Livelinne> Hope there’s no MOON BOSS woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:08:55] <%Amaideus> He's pretty funny
[0:08:57] <%Amaideus> RIP stairs
[0:08:59] <bashful_bard> Woolie in heck, reggie trying and failing to kill clonus
[0:09:01] <crossing_mao> @jubejube56 Two*
[0:09:08] <ExileNineteen> so who's fritz and who's asgore in this scenario
[0:09:09] <%Amaideus> Dokapon bots actively cheat
[0:09:13] <%Amaideus> They're not fun to play against
[0:09:15] <ExileNineteen> reggie vs. woolie??
[0:09:17] <%CursedNobleman> minh was being controlled by kaguya the whole time LUL
[0:09:17] <jubejube56> @crossing_mao Minh sold one passport right?
[0:09:23] <WG101> @jubejube56 yep
[0:09:28] <%Amaideus> Does that make Minh Flowey?
[0:09:29] <%RelaxedPizza> Kanye West likes fingers in his ass
[0:09:29] <crossing_mao> Not IIRC
[0:09:33] <nothuzad> Dokapon bots are mean but dokapon darkling bots are disgusting
[0:09:34] <%Solidnick18> reggie left the cave minh stole his passport and woolies
[0:09:44] <%Solidnick18> then sold woolies
[0:09:44] <ExileNineteen> LUL yeah we'll take it
[0:09:48] <crossing_mao> Oh realy? Ok then
[0:09:48] <%big_oki> dokapons Ai are better than a gears of war games Ai
[0:09:56] <+TheDyingPride> Waiting for the day when we cut to the couch area and there's just a knife stuck in the table
[0:09:58] <Mr_Ease> Woolie is crawling towards a blood chest with 3 skeleton keys
[0:10:00] <%Superdandy96> Gee Minh, how come Dokapon gives you TWO heck passports?
[0:10:07] <bashful_bard> I'm terrified of how mean a bot darkling is
[0:10:10] <%SomersaultJustice> it's wolly time
[0:10:16] <%SuperKirby24> dokapon bots on weak are already fucking disgusting NotLikeThis
[0:10:16] <ExileNineteen> dokapon is really hard to play solo just because you have to deal with a darkling like twice a chapter
[0:10:30] <+soundcloud_raptor> Dokapon. The FINAL Chapter
[0:10:37] <%Livelinne> BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[0:10:37] <ExileNineteen> it's actually worth it to NOT shit on the bots that hard because then you'll have one that is perma-darkling
[0:10:39] <aiutare47> @thedyingpride One of these days there’s just going to be a gun on the table and nothing else. Earn the blood pool.
[0:10:42] <crossing_mao> Don’t fear what doesn’t exist and never will BabyRage
[0:10:48] <%Superdandy96> WoolieVs Dokapon: Final
[0:10:52] <InXplotch> I've been playing dokapon against bots recently on normal, they're not very strategic with the darkling skills tbh
[0:10:58] <nothuzad> bashful_bard gets constant 30-40pts and sometimes a free 200pts for dark magic - almost perfectly uses it to sabotage and steal shit from you
[0:10:59] <crossing_mao> Bots were never born in this TL
[0:11:00] <WG101> WoolieVs (FINAL)
[0:11:05] <InXplotch> I haven't seen them save up for anything bigger than like a 70 cost skill
[0:11:10] <357Sneak> lytDORF zoneLemmyL zoneLemmyL lytOUCH
[0:11:13] <@Menitta> this is from that Overstory game isnt it
[0:11:15] <redstrawherring> Like I said before guys. Easiest cheat: Just switch control to AI LUL
[0:11:16] <Ozavic> Minh is most likely to win in an incredibly boring 'I just played the game' way Reggie is second most likely due to his luck and persistance Woolie will have victory in his grasp before hyper focusing on a minute goal or detail (or think killing the bbeg is instawin)
[0:11:23] <brunonunis> yeyeyeye
[0:11:24] <bashful_bard> Do they throw equipment away mostly or?
[0:11:26] <Cactuskris> time for woolies castle in the sky
[0:11:28] <357Sneak> SourPls
[0:11:31] <ExileNineteen> they don't save points for anything higher than the 120 skill, but if they randomly luck into 160 or 200 they'll use it
[0:11:32] <%Superdandy96> Hard cut to wooliePOYO
[0:11:39] <%DaBigVitus> historic end
[0:11:39] <ExileNineteen> bots 100% take your towns when they kill you
[0:11:39] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:11:45] <ExileNineteen> as darkling or otherwise
[0:11:53] <crossing_mao> Tuxedo Mask!
[0:11:55] <bashful_bard> Oof that's rough
[0:11:56] <brunonunis> is it ok if I just saw the anime, did it Cath up?
[0:11:56] <%Amaideus> bbeg is Big Bad Evil Guy?
[0:12:01] <ExileNineteen> yes
[0:12:02] <GeoffTheHero> 62 raiders from GeoffTheHero have joined! 
[0:12:07] <nothuzad> brunonunis anime is pretty much caught up
[0:12:09] <WG101> oh hey geoff
[0:12:11] <ExileNineteen> the anime is basically caught up
[0:12:13] <%SuperKirby24> Kreygasm
[0:12:14] <Mr_Ease> I wonder if in like 5 years from now, the gang will just go "rematch?" on Dokapon
[0:12:14] <+WytPony> eyyyyy
[0:12:14] <%Amaideus> Anime caught up at the start of last session
[0:12:19] <%Amaideus> Now it's slightly behind
[0:12:20] <Blabooer> This isn't Divekick. :(
[0:12:27] <Xeno351> Woolie is currently most likely to win, all he has to do is beat Rico
[0:12:28] <+Crackfiend> it's kickdive
[0:12:29] <Mr_Ease> Salty runback on dokapon in like 3-5 years
[0:12:35] <ExileNineteen> i wonder if in like 4 hours from now, the gang will just go "rematch?" on Dokapon PogChamp
[0:12:35] <+Mendin> The anime and manga approach simulcast
[0:12:35] <brunonunis> @nothuzad thanks man
[0:12:37] <InXplotch> the bots are fairly predictable in how they act, so Iwouldn't call them ruthless from my experience.
[0:12:42] <%Amaideus> As long as people don't harass them too hard for it, we can get them to do a second run a year+ from now
[0:12:44] <Ozavic> I want Pat on dokepon cryNaughty
[0:12:45] <+minusmarcigames> minusmarcigames subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:12:45] <+WytPony> Yo somebody say Divekick PogChamp
[0:12:53] <%paladinstarbuster> They really should push Dokapon onto the RT people
[0:12:53] <gekizenbu> Game of Dokopon
[0:12:58] <bashful_bard> Woolie can totally kill rico if the red chests treat him right
[0:13:00] <%Amaideus> But if people annoy the shit out of them about it then it'll take longer
[0:13:02] <treacherously_> I assume the reward for Rico is enough to basically win
[0:13:10] <crossing_mao> I think Pat would just be another Mihn tbh
[0:13:12] <%Amaideus> Woolie still needs a shield right?
[0:13:12] <%Kriss1827> YEYEYEYE
[0:13:13] <nothuzad> InXplotch its not per se that their AI is scary its more what the game gives to the ai that can make them scary
[0:13:13] <ExileNineteen> how many keys did woolie have again?

[0:15:02] <Cactuskris> woolie did u hear about the whole doom eternal thing?
[0:15:04] <dee_zoe> @ozavic I hope Reggie is smart and uses darkling to trash minh's staff
[0:15:11] <@Menitta> "Yo that play was sick!" "No really, he is vomiting now"

[0:31:44] <Mr__Jebus> DO IT
[0:31:45] <%C4m3r0n0409> Bleach is no worse than Naruto
[0:31:50] <YouKnowThatGuy1> Yeah they both get shafted
[0:31:50] <%jiggy_snipe> Bleach isn't bad enough for this answer
[0:31:52] <%phatmac16> Astlfo is a popular trap character
[0:31:53] <%0rond> astolfo is a meme but they are also a top tier character straight up
[0:31:55] <XzileGaming> someone did, ask Nick Simmons
[0:31:55] <%Amaideus> Bleach is way better than naruto
[0:31:56] <YakumoYomi> @InXplotch No way, fam.
[0:31:57] <LaughingCatt> Can we do the reverse, pull some characters out of a series to make it better?
[0:31:58] <+Order_of_Mystery> Doaks was awesome
[0:31:59] <%GenesisKnight> Dokes got done dirty
[0:31:59] <FboyDaKing> @invlux I think dooms source code is available you can take a look and sorta reverse engineer it.
[0:31:59] <lotharrio> "Surprise motherfucker!"
[0:32:00] <aiutare47> @inxplotch If rather save the concept
[0:32:00] <mark_collins45> Some fries, motherfucker
[0:32:01] <%kapcommunist> yeeeeees
[0:32:01] <InXplotch> there are a lot of characters in apoc that are popular
[0:32:02] <Zer0beats> naruto is shit and will always be shit
[0:32:03] <%Amaideus> Even with the axe ending
[0:32:03] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @dorf1 But its goid again now. Watch Babylonia
[0:32:04] <JeoDood> @meatmaaan agreed
[0:32:06] <olm46> Most of the characters in bleach deserve a far better show.
[0:32:06] <%jiggy_snipe> especially since Bleach has alot of good characters
[0:32:07] <%BisoromiBear> Robo Doakes could have saved the series
[0:32:10] <+meatmaaan> save Jon snow from his whole plotline being pointless
[0:32:10] <Robot_Nixon_> SUPPLIES motherfucker
[0:32:11] <%C4m3r0n0409> Naruto is so much worse than bleach
[0:32:12] <+Order_of_Mystery> Dexter went downhill fast. D:
[0:32:14] <+ThomasOfTroy> Doakes was cool
[0:32:22] <InXplotch> honestly I'd accept just eliminating the last liek 3 episodes, lol
[0:32:22] <XzileGaming> NICK SIMMONS literally stole Kenpachi right outta Bleach
[0:32:23] <Jrocy247> SOME FRIES MOTHA FUCKA
[0:32:25] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I don't know, I think Bleach, overall, is actually a little worse than Naruto
[0:32:28] <%0rond> memes notwithstanding Astolfo is a solid 10/10
[0:32:29] <%DaBigVitus> all the raiders dropping off. ouch.
[0:32:31] <Zer0beats> heart eyes motha fucka
[0:32:32] <%C4m3r0n0409> Nice
[0:32:34] <%countgaculatv> HEART EYES MUTHA FUCKKA
[0:32:35] <Scrummo> what's a Dokapon? @woolieversus

[0:34:10] <huskarl_zap> FAILED
[0:34:11] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Californication did that to me. I was just like "why the fuck am I watching this"
[0:34:12] <aiutare47> Movie?
[0:34:14] <%minusmarcigames> yea John Kellog wanted to make sure you didn't fuck
[0:34:14] <%ChoculaUltra> Where we at with the Blood Pool? 4K?

[0:34:17] <%minusmarcigames> like a lot
[0:34:17] <Zer0beats> eat them
[0:34:17] <gryffinp> No, he was a calvinist I believe
[0:34:24] <YouKnowThatGuy1> Good look guys
[0:34:25] <Jontman42> like I can eat cornflakes and jack off right after, what is it supposed to do
[0:34:26] <CalderGaming> THE ADVENTISTS STRIKE BACK
[0:34:26] <@Menitta> BRUH
[0:34:26] <+Bricespresso> explain please
[0:34:27] <huskarl_zap> IM EAT WHEATIES AND JERK OFF NOW
[0:34:30] <%Amaideus> Imagine not being able to eat while you fuck
[0:34:31] <%C4m3r0n0409> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
[0:34:33] <%iswearimjustdandy> Its always calvinists
[0:34:33] <%Amaideus> HAH
[0:34:35] <Robot_Nixon_> dont leave me hanging whats the reasoning?
[0:34:37] <aiutare47> You can say it woolie
[0:34:38] <+twohitgood> dr kellog
[0:34:48] <crossing_mao> Quaker and Aunt Jemima fucked hard
[0:34:49] <+BubbaRands> Cork Flakes and Masturbate LUL
[0:34:50] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[0:34:51] <+meatmaaan> Matthew Broderick also known as vehicular manslaughter man
[0:34:58] <@Menitta> I could go for some corn flakes.
[0:34:59] <%paladinstarbuster> SAGAT LOVES CORNFLAKES
[0:35:06] <+twohitgood> dr kellog also inspired one of the areas in West of Loathing
[0:35:08] <%heartlesshealer> oh boy
[0:35:10] <%Superdandy96> @meatmaaan or “that’s a lot of fish” guy
[0:35:11] <YouKnowThatGuy1> Rip Kellogg fall out 4
[0:35:14] <%minusmarcigames> cornflakes, the chosen food of volcels
[0:35:14] <YakumoYomi> He thought plain food would stop people from fapping. Amusing.
[0:35:16] <+Invlux> Gotta jack off to the Quaker Oats guy for good measure
[0:35:20] <assfordayz> Sup, I ready to spoil miself
[0:35:21] <Scrummo> were the corn flakes supposed to get stuck in there?
[0:35:25] <zeif00> Some of the character designs maybe
[0:35:38] <+meatmaaan> @superdandy96 either or
[0:35:42] <+aslfrasle> I'd say no charm potions in shops, only drops.
[0:35:47] <%paladinstarbuster> I wish NPCs did more
[0:35:47] <+TheDyingPride> 8 player Dokapon mod when
[0:35:50] <%Amaideus> I'd make the shops run out of items
[0:35:52] <Mr_Ease> All the hair options available at once
[0:35:52] <%jiggy_snipe> maybe a combo
[0:35:56] <%Amaideus> And have to restock
[0:35:56] <FboyDaKing> Also it must let u pet the dog.
[0:35:56] <%Superdandy96> Character designs could be better in some areas.
[0:36:02] <%GenesisKnight> Well only one of you abuses the hell out of it
[0:36:04] <+Bricespresso> clarity on status would be better
[0:36:04] <Fanciful_Unicorn> Field Magic actually has a little magic base too
[0:36:05] <FboyDaKing> I wanna pet cash
[0:36:06] <%Amaideus> Or make magic mirrors more easily bought
[0:36:08] <%JojoPiero> black skin mcs perhaps
[0:36:09] <megamanicpuppet> are they starting or ending
[0:36:10] <coldfire0007> MP needs buff, SP needs nerf
[0:36:11] <Valentinius_Anodyne> 8 Player Dokapon would be rad
[0:36:12] <bashful_bard> Magic accuracy should totally be magic primarily
[0:36:16] <FboyDaKing> Or mitch digger
[0:36:17] <YouKnowThatGuy1> Starting
[0:36:17] <Monkeyweed21> Speed for dodgem, MG for hit chance and power
[0:36:19] <Fanciful_Unicorn> speed to make it hit, but your Magic makes it more damaging
[0:36:23] <%emperordread> Online money matches for Dokapon Kingdom 2
[0:36:34] <+TheDyingPride> If DEF affected odds of getting hit by field magic, it might actually be a useful stat
[0:36:35] <%jiggy_snipe> everything needs an obvious easy counter if the thing is easy to use
[0:36:42] <FboyDaKing> @emperordread matcherino integration.
[0:36:54] <jhonxiolonn> Woolie, you should try the Cinders mod
[0:36:56] <+NWR_James> AI Rivals who exist only to hunt you down and ruin your run
[0:37:01] <assfordayz> LUL
[0:37:02] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah, that would be ideal
[0:37:04] <+CMash2k> hey guys tuned in late, whats the blood pool at?
[0:37:08] <YouKnowThatGuy1> Hero class should be easily to get
[0:37:12] <Mr_Ease> All hair unlocked from the start, and maybe spaces to change class other than the castle
[0:37:26] <magicjeffy> online dokapon should have voice chat that can't be turned off
[0:37:30] <YouKnowThatGuy1> Change jobs at temple
[0:37:40] <+FlubbedPig> Maybe have like, MG for your chance to hit with Field Magic vs their Speed for chance to dodge? That way it's a lot tougher to get a character that can hit every time without ever being hit.
[0:37:42] <zocano> Poor Reggie
[0:37:43] <JeoDood> auto saves everytime
[0:37:45] <zocano> ):
[0:37:45] <alexandrecau> I am the final villain Reggie
[0:37:48] <%countgaculatv> I'd make darkling a class

[0:37:54] <%Fujiwara_92> DansGame
[0:37:56] <zocano> no comment from Woolie

[0:38:30] <%Amaideus> SILENCE
[0:38:31] <+NWR_James> Here comes the twist ending
[0:38:31] <+Invlux> Would Dokapon be improved by minigames tho 🤔

[0:38:32] <%spiritofmojave> Peace is disgusting

[0:38:37] <%countgaculatv> PEACE IS A LIE, THERE IS ONLY PASSION
[0:38:37] <%C4m3r0n0409> QUIT PUTTING STUFF IN PEACE POOL
[0:38:37] <%optimasmaximas> it could still be ruined
[0:38:37] <YouKnowThatGuy1> Friendship depends on the gloating afterwards
[0:38:38] <gryffinp> hard cut to the end of the stream

[0:38:49] <%SuperKirby24> PEACE IS FOR QUITTERS Kappa
[0:38:49] <bashful_bard> The start was definitely the most dangerous time for their friendship
[0:38:52] <+Estuko> WOOLIEVS [FINAL]
[0:39:02] <%Amaideus> Nah, the Infinite Squall arc was
[0:39:02] <%spiritofmojave> LUL
[0:39:02] <huskarl_zap> WOOLIE VERSUS FINAL
[0:39:02] <FboyDaKing> Imagine the game just ends in 15 minutes.
[0:39:03] <%Solidnick18> friends until it ends
[0:39:04] <%Superdandy96> @invlux it would increase the amount of times the game can screw someone over
[0:39:07] <arkv01> it's okay to stab a bitch :)
[0:39:11] <%C4m3r0n0409> Start was way worse than no
[0:39:12] <coldfire0007> Dokapon doesnt end until someone is strangled
[0:39:12] <%C4m3r0n0409> now
[0:39:15] <huskarl_zap> THREE CHRISTMASSES
[0:39:16] <ExileNineteen> DSP will financially outlive the heat death of the universe

[0:39:31] <%Amaideus> I mean, Poker
[0:39:33] <%Ipsenscastle> DSP will be the only think left after the nukes
[0:39:40] <+RealPT1> mystery tournament with dokapon
[0:39:40] <%Ipsenscastle> *thing
[0:39:42] <gekizenbu> Dokapon in the bathroom
[0:39:42] <aiutare47> If someone doesn’t die is it really dokapon?
[0:39:43] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:39:44] <%emperordread> I would take out a 2nd mortgage to fund a dokapon money match entry
[0:39:45] <Valentinius_Anodyne> That would make it even better, being dunked on by RNG
[0:39:53] <+Estuko> @Ipsenscastle I hate that it's possible with how he even escaped the 500k debt recently..
[0:39:53] <%netrac> 100K Dokapon invitational
[0:39:53] <%gatorafan> Dokapon is not E-Spoprts
[0:40:03] <Explodincatz> woolie there are leaderboards of randomizers
[0:40:06] <assfordayz> Who wants to see a "Total global saturation" meme?
[0:40:12] <TheFinalSentinel> @gatorafan not with that attitude
[0:40:12] <%minusmarcigames> dokapon requires thuggery
[0:40:13] <%optimasmaximas> @Estuko he WHAT?!
[0:40:15] <bashful_bard> God a dokapon invitational would be disastrous
[0:40:16] <CobaltPhoenix27> if there was competitive Dokapon, the only way anyone would win would be by being the last to have a heated gamer moment
[0:40:19] <%GenesisKnight> Call up RT and set up Hardcore Dokapon
[0:40:21] <+Invlux> Twitch Plays: Dokapon
[0:40:25] <redstrawherring> Character Polls
[0:40:28] <BurdRightsActivist> DOKAPON is better reality tv than reality TV
[0:40:29] <%C4m3r0n0409> MITCH. DIGGER
[0:40:34] <+Estuko> @optimasmaximas super massive debt, I think he declared bankruptcy or somethin. No more debt.
[0:40:35] <FboyDaKing> @invlux YES
[0:40:37] <huskarl_zap> this is also rigged
[0:40:38] <FboyDaKing> YES
[0:40:44] <%vextalyst> cheer500 yo woolie I feel super embarrassed having recommended Airgear as literally JSRF the anime without even knowing Skankfunk worked on the anime's soundtrack. Also for a question earlier lets not forget Rick Grimes got literally airlifted out of TWD
[0:40:45] <JeoDood> dokapon > tv show
[0:40:47] <DedlokPM> So we have Dokapon the Manga, Dokapon the Anime, but when we getting Dokapon the Netflix Adaptation?
[0:40:53] <evilaltruistic> people dont care how fair the game is. they care of how entertaining it is
[0:40:59] <+Invlux> Just set up a separate channel for each controller lol
[0:40:59] <%optimasmaximas> @Estuko oh i know about that i just wanted to know how he escaped it
[0:41:04] <%ChoculaUltra> I imagine “hardcore dokapon” is dokapon but everyone has a flensing knife.
[0:41:05] <YouKnowThatGuy1> No bots as that's an issue for sneaky difficulty bots
[0:41:17] <%minusmarcigames> fuck i don't care, rig it to shit
[0:41:19] <%minusmarcigames> wrestling is good
[0:41:24] <Jontman42> the game was rigged from the start and they'll split the bloodpool even
[0:41:30] <+dankdirtydan> are they still friend?
[0:41:36] <%DaBigVitus> As the drill rotates and my well gets bigger, how many bitches wanna fuck this digger named mitch.
[0:41:37] <huskarl_zap> NO
[0:41:37] <+TheDyingPride> The Netflix Adaptation will be the highlight reel that's gonna come out in like 3 months
[0:41:38] <%Amaideus> God bless Air Gear's anime
[0:41:44] <+Promessa_EX> i want to see blood go to winner and it get used

[0:41:58] <+Promessa_EX> that helicopter crashed
[0:41:59] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Xxnanshankingladdyxx

[0:51:04] <WG101> STARRING REGGIE HYUUGA
[0:51:07] <+DesertPenguin> ?
[0:51:07] <%greatmonorail> Reggie developed by not only having a plan but writing it down.
[0:51:09] <%Daba_mk2> The plan
[0:51:14] <%DashXero> Is Reggie about to pull some Joseph Joestar shit?!
[0:51:14] <%C4m3r0n0409> Stream over
[0:51:16] <huskarl_zap> johns
[0:51:16] <%yeetdabsenpai69> kill minh
[0:51:17] <+DesertPenguin> ??
[0:51:22] <%C4m3r0n0409> LUL
[0:51:27] <+InfiniteHav0k> F**k Ijust realizedI didnt see the last session :(
[0:51:31] <%Daba_mk2> Dokapon refuses to end
[0:51:31] <+blademaster247> The universe wasn't ready for Reggie to have a plan and now everything is falling apart
[0:51:32] <%Superdandy96> Woolz gotta fix up his totally legit wii Kappa
[0:51:37] <TheFramedWarlock> What's going on ?
[0:51:40] <+Spr0cket> Minh's cowardice broke the game
[0:51:40] <%yeetdabsenpai69> go over and take his passports
[0:51:47] <%countgaculatv> Minh turned on his secret switch to stop controllers from working LUL
[0:51:48] <kei_ar_> Its cross tekken all over agian
[0:51:50] <%greatmonorail> It would have been great if reggie pulled out a binder with a single sheet of loose leaf in it
[0:51:52] <%soFISHticated98> why does reggie want minh's passport anyways
[0:51:55] <%soFISHticated98> reggie has no towns
[0:51:56] <+Partialrecall2> zentreWOAH
[0:51:58] <captainpotato009> Hold On
[0:51:59] <lilredmage> Technical Difficulties <3
[0:52:02] <gustavozxd> Woolie's new hair looks so cute
[0:52:05] <%soFISHticated98> he's just wasting turns when he can go to heck right now
[0:52:10] <huskarl_zap> The sabotage
[0:52:12] <NeroInfinite> That's why he wants it so he can go into hell
[0:52:16] <AppleBoi85> tintical difficulties Squid1 Squid2 Squid3 Squid4
[0:52:17] <WG101> @soFISHticated98 passport allows you to go to hell
[0:52:19] <lilredmage> WAS THIS PART OF THE PLAN?
[0:52:21] <%Livelinne> Oooooh TEASING woolieSHOOK
[0:52:22] <+BubbaRands> damn duracell LUL
[0:52:22] <armchairmaster_> The battery MINDGAMES
[0:52:25] <%emperordread> Was this Reggie's strat that he wrote down? Is he going Deathnote level thinking?
[0:52:26] <%soFISHticated98> yes it does but reggie can just get a new one
[0:52:29] <WG101> you sell the towns to get the passport from the gate
[0:52:30] <+Invlux> Save Corruption monkaS
[0:52:31] <%heroversusofficial> ALL ACCORDING TO KEKKIRU
[0:52:31] <Morning_Asakura> this was part of the plan
[0:52:32] <%hoenhime344> @soFISHticated98 thats the point. you need to give up 1/4 of your towns to get the passport.
[0:52:32] <%soFISHticated98> instead woolie is getting a head start
[0:52:33] <agilesalmon> Professional streamer
[0:52:35] <+TomDanksEGOT> is this part of Reggies galaxy brain strat?
[0:52:37] <funwashere> doodHokey
[0:52:37] <%MrRabbles> looking at the dokapon core right now
[0:52:37] <dee_zoe> Reggie has no towns
[0:52:39] <%Superdandy96> Reggie so deep, he’s in OUR MINDS chat
[0:52:42] <%soFISHticated98> yeah but reggie has no towns so it doesn't matter
[0:52:42] <%Daba_mk2> i think reggie was blinded by rage and just wanted to kill minh last session
[0:52:43] <+JamesCorck> I'm watching the anime of Dokapon, but I can't catch u`p in time, so for the first time I'm going to read ahead on the manga.
[0:52:43] <%PsideFxX> BATTERY sbfpGou sbfpGi
[0:52:51] <lilredmage> There is no chat. Only Reggie.
[0:52:52] <lemon_lore> save delete game over?
[0:52:54] <%soFISHticated98> 1/4 of 1 or 2 towns is nothing
[0:52:55] <dee_zoe> and he doesn't want min to get in to heck for free
[0:52:58] <%soFISHticated98> just get a new one
[0:53:01] <Heartless_01> reggie is the only one that can stop minh
[0:53:05] <huskarl_zap> The plan

[0:53:24] <gigiaten> @jamescorck I'd recommend watching the anime before jumping in to this chapter of the manga
[0:53:25] <%Superdandy96> woolieDATTEBAYO_BW
[0:53:31] <huskarl_zap> Can we get hype or will the but censor us again?
[0:53:34] <Jrocy247> Man, it's wild to see Woolie with Short hair

[0:54:16] <+itsOnyxLeo> MINH ABOUT TO CASH IN THAT N-PASS
[0:54:16] <%soFISHticated98> so many weird decisions

[0:54:19] <%Superdandy96> Deepest Africa dark
[0:54:19] <+Invlux> Minh about to use his N-Pass with a hot mic

[0:54:36] <%PsideFxX> Minh has the PLATINUM pass
[0:54:40] <%Daba_mk2> Minh N pass premium
[0:54:41] <%emperordread> @Invlux About to pull a NASCAR
[0:54:43] <%C4m3r0n0409> That music tho
[0:54:47] <armchairmaster_> MINH WOOLIE'S PASS IS COUNTERFIT, don't fall for his lies!
[0:54:47] <%soFISHticated98> instead he went to australia one turn early? didn't actually accomplish anything
[0:54:51] <AppleBoi85> PartyTime
[0:54:52] <%C4m3r0n0409> Slightly loud
[0:54:52] <%PsideFxX> MihN-Pass
[0:54:56] <%soFISHticated98> he global saturationed in the end anyways
[0:54:58] <AMaidIndeed> Phase into the DAHKNESS CAST
[0:55:08] <%Ashenik1> now it is optimal Reggie Minh doesnt have any spinners !!!
[0:55:10] <%Daba_mk2> Do not purse lu bu
[0:55:13] <huskarl_zap> I'm gonna say the g word
[0:55:27] <%yeetdabsenpai69> HE HAS NO SPINNERS
[0:55:28] <%JojoPiero> G*mer?
[0:55:29] <%soFISHticated98> woolie is a genius rn, getting reggie to chase minh while he gets to go for rico
[0:55:30] <%PsideFxX> Gulla Gulla?
[0:55:30] <huskarl_zap> GWILO
[0:55:32] <%yeetdabsenpai69> GET HIM
[0:55:32] <%C4m3r0n0409> Why?
[0:55:35] <%Ipsenscastle> go to heck Reggie, dont let Woolie puppet you
[0:55:35] <%yeetdabsenpai69> KILL
[0:55:39] <funwashere> when the world intervenes with the game to prevent its end doodLUL
[0:55:41] <%soFISHticated98> like reggie isn't even taking towns, he is doing nothing
[0:55:42] <%C4m3r0n0409> Whats the plan
[0:55:42] <lilredmage> > > Lu Bu Has Fled The Battlefield !
[0:55:43] <%yeetdabsenpai69> GET MINH
[0:55:43] <%Daba_mk2> get to heck now
[0:55:46] <ThighsSupreme> Just go to hell, Minh is heading there anyways
[0:55:55] <%Ashenik1> Minh doestn have spinners Reggie !!!!
[0:55:59] <%yeetdabsenpai69> KILL MINH FIRST
[0:56:06] <+Dimfish> he cant go to hell minh stole his passport
[0:56:15] <%soFISHticated98> he can get a new one
[0:56:21] <%C4m3r0n0409> Rand is more tho
[0:56:24] <Dalkalopagus> If they could do a pincer move with one in Africa and one in Australia, it could work. Not worth the effort though
[0:56:27] <%Superdandy96> @dimfish can’t he just get a new one though?
[0:56:27] <+Dimfish> why do that when he can steal it ack
[0:56:31] <%DashXero> Has Reggie been reviewing the tapes?
[0:56:32] <%EyeFarted> Makita Hahaha
[0:56:34] <%soFISHticated98> because it's a waste of time
[0:56:36] <+Dimfish> back*
[0:56:39] <%JojoPiero> Wait Woolie reset the world and then just... went to Hell and didn't get any cities?
[0:56:41] <%soFISHticated98> he's taking like 10 turns to chase minh down
[0:56:45] <JeoDood> reggie is waiting for minh
[0:56:50] <%soFISHticated98> when he can just go to heck right now
[0:56:58] <%C4m3r0n0409> Yup
[0:56:58] <huskarl_zap> BIG BRAIN REGGIE
[0:57:01] <%Ashenik1> It was a perfect time to attack Minh :<
[0:57:02] <%Amaideus> Yup
[0:57:09] <Zebekis> The notebook is blank! It's a bluff!
[0:57:09] <redstrawherring> @jojopiero woolie has like 3 castles
[0:57:11] <+Dimfish> but he could get a bunch of towns then get into hell free
[0:57:12] <%C4m3r0n0409> @JojoPiero Pretty much
[0:57:13] <ExileNineteen> @JojoPiero he has plenty of castle value, and he's guessing the final boss is worth
[0:57:16] <agilesalmon> Galaxy brain time
[0:57:17] <%soFISHticated98> meanwhile woolie can afford to waste time getting a red chest
[0:57:18] <alexandrecau> He couldn't attack minh on that turn
[0:57:19] <+teavian> Your dreams are unclear
[0:57:22] <%JojoPiero> Big Brains
[0:57:31] <%emperordread> all according to sepuku
[0:57:33] <Make_me_mad> Woolie did the global monster invasion and then went into the underworld?

[0:57:57] <%C4m3r0n0409> woolie
[0:57:57] <+TheDyingPride> I'm hoping the thing that fucks up the plan is someone gets a "Come Here" spell

[0:59:24] <+TheDyingPride> Rich gets richer
[0:59:24] <Mr_McFries> Right now, because of Minh's cowardice, he is wasting a ton of turns. If Reggie followed him in, he would be wasting turns as well
[0:59:26] <%DaBigVitus> capialist bird

[0:59:35] <Mr__Jebus> Minh part of the 1%
[0:59:42] <%soFISHticated98> Minh's biggest mistake was taking a passport
[0:59:45] <%soFISHticated98> he didn't need one
[0:59:54] <%yeetdabsenpai69> go to heck reggie
[0:59:55] <%soFISHticated98> he should have just took all the towns while Reggie and Woolie were in Heck
[0:59:56] <arkv01> minh they will eat you and refrigerate the leftovers
[0:59:56] <%Superdandy96> Well, he is the Minhister of Evil Kappa
[0:59:59] <sonofthedeepsouth> Will the murder scene be today?
[0:59:59] <Mr_McFries> With Minh being alchemist, I'm not sure outright killing him would be that big of a setback
[1:00:01] <Decimated_body> @Mr_McFries reggie always wastes turns though LUL
[1:00:03] <aiutare47> A true game of dokapon ends with a bodybag
[1:00:07] <%ekodrop> reggie has a lot of field magic
[1:00:12] <%DashXero> Ridin' spinners. He's Ridin' Spinners. They don't stop.
[1:00:17] <agilesalmon> The Minh get richer and the poor get Poorer

[1:00:46] <%paladinstarbuster> GET A ROADBLOCK
[1:00:49] <lilredmage> its not going to feel real when this playthrough ends
[1:00:55] <%Ipsenscastle> If they level in heck they can just beat the money out of Minh

[1:01:14] <ExileNineteen> it looks like he might actually want to do wallace
[1:01:14] <%soFISHticated98> if they level in heck they can just win the game by beating rico
[1:01:28] <%soFISHticated98> I don't know why everyone has a hardon for them physically fighting minh
[1:01:34] <%yeetdabsenpai69> I think everyone can already beat minh
[1:01:36] <%soFISHticated98> they can do a lot better than that

[1:02:08] <%Ipsenscastle> @soFISHticated98 I think the idea is that between towns and alchemy, Minh just wins by staying in the overworld
[1:02:09] <armchairmaster_> Must win
[1:02:11] <Make_me_mad> I feel like Woolie just looked up how to win the game easy and is doing that.
[1:02:13] <%gatorafan> Pockets STRONK
[1:02:13] <+TheDyingPride> I wonder when Woolie's gonna realize his magic is real good
[1:02:14] <+Invlux> LEVEL 78
[1:02:17] <%countgaculatv> He must win
[1:02:17] <secretbosssauce> Dude went into hell without a shield. How's he going to take down Rico?
[1:02:22] <arkv01> no room for RNG now
[1:02:22] <NickHatesSnow> Woolie is so damn strong geez

[1:34:17] <%soFISHticated98> woolie is too far ahead. no way minh catches up
[1:34:17] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @exilenineteen ming cant take the boss
[1:34:26] <redstrawherring> Lava Cave is the only way now
[1:34:29] <%gutlesscoward> @yeetdabsenpai69 he has infinite revives
[1:34:34] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @sofishticated98 and even if he did minh stands no chance
[1:34:35] <%soFISHticated98> minh can take the boss by attrition with revivals
[1:34:38] <%jiggy_snipe> i don't think Minh can end. If Wallace is level 88 wtf is Rico Sr. gonna be
[1:34:38] <SethKyu> If woolie doesn't die, he has this, I think

[1:34:52] <%soFISHticated98> alechemist is unkillable with an inventory of revivals

[1:48:28] <%emperordread> @elbigante Reggie found Wallace under the sea and got wasted. Woolie found a gun
[1:48:33] <%Amaideus> That's suspect
[1:48:33] <rufus2k2> Woolie has Gene Starwind's Caster Gun
[1:48:35] <alexandrecau> Lock him and go get purse cut

[1:48:57] <MisterArcanine> Fuck Minh over while he’s in heck
[1:49:02] <Make_me_mad> The problem with Minh's clonus is that it can rust his equipment.

[2:00:31] <%soFISHticated98> yeah he'll do less damage
[2:00:32] <gryffinp> Is that even better without the +30% from the class bonus?
[2:00:33] <+blademaster247> Speed go up but staff give 30%
[2:00:34] <Mr_Ease> Staff is actually better
[2:00:34] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Minh, Left Hand of God
[2:00:34] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Gespens
[2:00:35] <%xcompleasedad> NERF YOUR DAMAGE
[2:00:35] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> FeelsBadMan

[2:00:37] <%Jetzord> Karma is balancing the checkbooks now
[2:00:39] <Fanciful_Unicorn> Minh is using hacks up in here
[2:00:40] <Idon__> even more SPEED

[2:00:42] <+Zenryoku21> the 30% tho?
[2:00:43] <%emperordread> God-o Pawnch!
[2:00:43] <%Superblooms> but the speed.
[2:00:43] <SGrim> Minh is destined to win woopsGasm
[2:00:43] <+teavian> ROAR OF EARTH
[2:00:43] <lotharrio> You got rid of that one.
[2:00:44] <NickHatesSnow> THE GODDESS OF SPEED IS REAL
[2:00:44] <%soFISHticated98> it's only +10 attack
[2:00:45] <BurningSaph> Reggie got rings of magic
[2:00:46] <+Dimfish> reggie got a bunch of items last session
[2:00:46] <%StaceMcGate> Atack will go down, but 20 speed tho
[2:00:47] <Mr__Jebus> yes cuz he loses his 30%
[2:00:47] <%jiggy_snipe> the ring of magic Reggie like twice
[2:00:48] <agilesalmon> Take everything I own for health, sounds like American healthcare system.
[2:00:48] <%Ipsenscastle> Reggie got offered only duplicates last time
[2:00:49] <+el_boney> Take the Fist!
[2:00:49] <%SuperKirby24> NERF YOUR MAGIC LUL

[2:00:51] <%kingkeldeo31> Keep the staff
[2:00:52] <%gatorafan> THE FINGER OF GOD daedra1DrunkTibs
[2:00:53] <%spiritofmojave> Minh is of the Dokapon Gods' chosen
[2:00:54] <Mr__Jebus> no dont think
[2:00:55] <DiscoDur0> Alchemist is magician base
[2:00:55] <%soFISHticated98> YES MINH
[2:00:55] <%ekodrop> good man
[2:00:57] <+bizzer10> take that shit
[2:00:57] <huskarl_zap> VILLAIN COLLUDING WITH THE DEMONS
[2:00:57] <%soFISHticated98> thank you
[2:00:58] <Leonavius> Is Alchemist considered magician-class?
[2:01:02] <%Superblooms> understandable.
[2:01:04] <+bizzer10> take it dummy
[2:01:04] <Xeno351> 20 SPEED
[2:01:05] <%Amaideus> Ye
[2:01:07] <%Solidnick18> Come on woolie
[2:01:07] <%soFISHticated98> yes
[2:01:07] <+el_boney> Big speed tho
[2:01:08] <%heartlesshealer> man, fuck off with the give up machine
[2:01:09] <Idon__> SPEED THO
[2:01:10] <%Fujiwara_92> BUT SPEED
[2:01:12] <%C4m3r0n0409> LUL
[2:01:12] <%yeetdabsenpai69> dont take it :)
[2:01:14] <Idon__> aww
[2:01:14] <Jrocy247> @Leonavius Basically
[2:01:14] <%ekodrop> 3
[2:01:15] <morningmoondude> SPED
[2:01:16] <%KosOrSomeSayKosm_> he turned down the god hand
[2:01:16] <%irfan_> thats a 5 percent drop apparently
[2:01:17] <%heartlesshealer> I mean, it's funny, but damn
[2:01:17] <roarofdamnation> difficult but i get it
[2:01:17] <%hoenhime344> yessssssssssssssssssssss
[2:01:19] <%yeetdabsenpai69> YES
[2:01:19] <%royb2> he already has enough speed to 0% field magic
[2:01:25] <%Ipsenscastle> temple reggie
[2:01:28] <%Superblooms> but more speed
[2:01:28] <%MrRabbles> speed is negligible for minh at this point
[2:01:28] <%yeetdabsenpai69> WOOLIE HAS A
[2:01:31] <%soFISHticated98> 20% is the minimum I think
[2:01:32] <%EyeFarted> TWICE
[2:01:34] <%GenesisKnight> You got the ring of magic twice
[2:01:34] <%Amaideus> Didn't it try to give him the ring of magic twice when he already had one?
[2:01:34] <%soFISHticated98> but point is real
[2:01:36] <ExileNineteen> you can never 0% field magic with only speed, always 20%
[2:01:36] <%yeetdabsenpai69> ADVANTAGE
[2:01:36] <+Zenryoku21> I wonder if it would've had a special chance like woolie's tho
[2:01:41] <mobiusnightshade> What is a god, to a heretic?
[2:01:42] <BurningSaph> Someday pockets will have a shield
[2:01:42] <+SaltyGhostRock> That is the nail in reggie's coffin
[2:01:45] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @amaideus yes
[2:01:47] <bashful_bard> Give up yields items every time so not quite 5%
[2:01:49] <%soFISHticated98> well he was fighting the lich a bunch of times
[2:01:50] <arkv01> put a ring on it
[2:01:50] <+Gespens> WOOLIE FIRST
[2:01:54] <+pectusumbra> To be fair that gun is sick, and if you were a robo knight it'd be even better
[2:01:55] <zocano> Reggie could win if he takes enough times before the kill
[2:01:55] <Fanciful_Unicorn> COMMIT!
[2:01:56] <%soFISHticated98> and that's the drop it gives most commonly
[2:02:01] <Electro96> what led reggie to this plan?
[2:02:01] <%xcompleasedad> Pockets is First?
[2:02:05] <%Th3SmartAlec> Lets gooooo

[2:19:41] <daddytrashprime> Hello Woolzmeister and squad of slightly lower interest. I wanted to point out to you that according to early Boruto, the reason for why Orochimari got off the hook is because his research is vital to prepare for more moon aliens, and he is kept under constant ANBU surveilance. @WoolieVersus
[2:19:41] <ExileNineteen> this is a good move if he does it
[2:19:43] <%Grayhammatter> there's big guards

[2:27:14] <%SuperKirby24> Take all the time in the world pls
[2:27:16] <%Ipsenscastle> All Woolie's thinking boils down to 'This might happen .... BUT THAT might happen also'
[2:27:17] <+IwuzPh34rless> Leave him be this turn
[2:27:19] <gryffinp> STRIKE
[2:27:19] <%alpacasintophats> take your time and probably wait a turn

[2:28:47] <%C4m3r0n0409> So play safe
[2:28:48] <Jrocy247> The only way Minh could get Woolie, is if Curse activated. WHICH IS A LOW CHANCE. Woolie would take Minh's Item
[2:28:48] <suddenlyscorched> This is when the Good Shonen Music Plays while the hero takes a split-second to analyze the battlefield
[2:28:48] <supergoblinpunch> Minh knows Woolie overthinks everything
[2:28:49] <Idon__> are you playing to win or are you playing to avoid losing?
[2:28:50] <%Fujiwara_92> JUST WAIT

[2:34:20] <Josef_Stryker> SO YOU KNOW THAT WE'RE OUT THERE
[2:34:20] <%C4m3r0n0409> Minh
[2:34:21] <%Amaideus> Officially I'm neutral
[2:34:23] <Fanciful_Unicorn> anyone by Minh
[2:34:23] <shotgang86> Woolie
[2:34:25] <sonofthedeepsouth> 2 bodies found in an apartment in quebec
[2:34:25] <CobaltPhoenix27> TEAM WOOLIE
[2:34:25] <Zerotoad5> Minh
[2:34:25] <%jiggy_snipe> Reggie
[2:34:26] <%iswearimjustdandy> Woolie
[2:34:26] <NeroInfinite> that's acursed image that dragon one.
[2:34:27] <%Kriss1827> Team Woolie
[2:34:27] <%Fujiwara_92> IT WONT END TONIGHT CHAT
[2:34:29] <%irfan_> Team Minh
[2:34:29] <%dogwelder02> woolie shouldve fought minh, ate that last revival
[2:34:29] <KNWatcher> I've abandoned team Minh
[2:34:32] <%C4m3r0n0409> Team WHOEVER WINS
[2:34:32] <darkbat52> Reggie
[2:34:32] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Reggie, unfortunately
[2:34:33] <Jrocy247> @SchwaAkari I wouldn't believe that. You know why? He overthinks, which causes him to make the wrong choices. Which has happened MANY of times
[2:34:33] <%Amaideus> But Minh's been the best player this entire LP so I think he should win
[2:34:33] <CallMeMrFahrenheit> Team not so minh
[2:34:34] <%Jetzord> Reggie
[2:34:35] <%heartlesshealer> I'm on Team not-Minh
[2:34:35] <%Daba_mk2> team minh mustn't win
[2:34:39] <Augus7717> TEAM WOOLIE
[2:34:39] <+Razputin217> TAKE YOUR HEART
[2:34:42] <%emperordread> @StaceMcGate Never getting off of the #TeamReggie train woolieREGGIEFUL
[2:34:42] <Josef_Stryker> LIFE WILL CHANGE
[2:34:43] <+Saggitori> REGGIE
[2:34:43] <%Fujiwara_92> TEAM WOOLIE
[2:34:44] <samuraijakanddaxter> I missed the blood pool announcement at tye start, what are we at?
[2:34:45] <%Grayhammatter> reggie, i hope he can kill wallace
[2:34:45] <armchairmaster_> Woolie
[2:34:46] <+Gondab> Reggie can still come back!
[2:34:47] <%StaceMcGate> @Fujiwara_92 it won't end, but lets see what everyones loyalty is
[2:34:47] <%BisoromiBear> God has chosen Minh and so should you
[2:34:47] <%Amaideus> But if Woolie or Reggie wins because of reasons I'm 100% okay with that
[2:34:47] <%JojoPiero> I'm still holding out for Pockets, gotta get that lesbian ending
[2:34:49] <%iswearimjustdandy> Ive been woolie since the beginning, havent changed a single time
[2:34:49] <ExileNineteen> minh best player, minh worst winner
[2:34:49] <%gatorafan> Minh
[2:34:50] <KnivesEve> who ever is chaos team i with
[2:34:50] <%spiritofmojave> LIFE WILL CHANGEEE
[2:34:51] <realapothe> after that orgasm tier filler arc I can't help but be teamWoolie, he won me over
[2:34:52] <+TheDyingPride> I'm on Team Not-woolie, but also hoping Minh gets his come-uppance since the Alchemist abuse arc
[2:34:52] <%Amaideus> @samuraijakanddaxter 4075
[2:34:54] <+AWanderingKenku> They're scheming how to split the blood pool money when this is over!
[2:34:54] <%Solidnick18> reggie pls
[2:34:55] <%dogwelder02> even if he died, minh prolly couldnt have beaten rico at half health
[2:34:55] <gantzwasprettygood> Minh deserves the win
[2:34:56] <%jiggy_snipe> @samuraijakanddaxter $4075
[2:34:56] <Dr00_PhD> Team Not-Minh
[2:34:57] <mudapersona> TEAM BLOOD POOL
[2:34:58] <InXplotch> I can't in good conscience root for any of these chuckleheads
[2:34:58] <ExpressNode> Scumbag tactics let us cling to scum together
[2:34:59] <sekainoowaride> Life will Change
[2:35:00] <zocano> Reggie is in the running if he gets the window to take towns
[2:35:02] <%C4m3r0n0409> Whoever wins wins at this point
[2:35:03] <BearSawed> team GUN
[2:35:05] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Is this whole stream "the planet will blow up in 5 mins"?
[2:35:10] <zocano> The week event screwed him
[2:35:10] <Augus7717> ANYONE BUT MINH
[2:35:12] <armchairmaster_> Even if Reggie kills Wallace, it won't be enough to get the lead
[2:35:12] <NeroInfinite> Life Will Change
[2:35:14] <%spiritofmojave> Here's how Reggie can still win!
[2:35:16] <bashful_bard> GUN will prevail
[2:35:17] <%SchwaAkari> I've never been on any of the teams; I think for a blind run on one of the most brutal games ever created these three are equally my heroes
[2:35:17] <Fanciful_Unicorn> I would support Minh if the game wasn't slanting so far in his favor
[2:35:18] <%Struggleful> God is on Minh's side. Team Woolie is for the Heretics
[2:35:19] <mdkcde> team "THE ENEMIHN MUST NOT WIN"
[2:35:21] <daddytrashprime> Anyone saying they're not here for Woolie more so than the other two is a liar.
[2:35:23] <Jrocy247> Nah, Reggie is done, he's wasting his time on Filler, It's only Minh and Woolie that may result the final win
[2:35:24] <%heartlesshealer> as soon as the boys found out about Alchemist, all my hype has turned to hate
[2:35:25] <%emperordread> Reggie has faced the strongest villain in the whole manga. He's fighting white walkers while Woolie and Minh are fighting the Lannisters
[2:35:26] <gantzwasprettygood> The instrumental version is better
[2:35:28] <%jiggy_snipe> Reggie should take South America then he can try and fight Wallce again tho I think he needs to grind 1st
[2:35:32] <+ultimafullmetal> Woolie going into Minh's palace right now!
[2:35:43] <%Daba_mk2> yes this is the frieza fight of dokapon

[2:41:39] <%Amaideus> Go to a yellow, give up, then crystal through later on
[2:41:40] <+Mekhet09> I BELIEVE IN YOU WOOLIE.
[2:41:41] <%StaceMcGate> DON'T MISS YOUR CHANCE TO BLOW
[2:41:42] <Jrocy247> Woolie is so Paranoid about Curse, even though it has a LOW CHANCE
[2:41:44] <Mr_Ease> why are people honestly annoyed by the most interesting part of the game, the decision making
[2:41:46] <alexandrecau> he has a crystal he doesn't need to spin
[2:41:46] <%Amaideus> You can't be hit by spells while given up
[2:41:46] <%heartlesshealer> End the illegal Revival Farm
[2:41:47] <%alpacasintophats> yellow plus giveup?
[2:41:48] <%soFISHticated98> well he might not use spinner

[2:41:58] <%Binary_Fireball> I walked into the room at the right time
[2:41:58] <%DaBigVitus> why is he talking like curse will call death?
[2:41:59] <%SchwaAkari> I thought Curse was a half-chance to self-harm but maybe it's lower?
[2:41:59] <%Fujiwara_92> wait minh to be active, then kill him
[2:42:01] <viewtifulr> wheres the timer minh said

[3:03:38] <%kapcommunist> this is Berserk boat saga bad
[3:03:42] <%Jetzord> not like Reggie can do anything with the towns closed
[3:03:42] <%Grayhammatter> reggie is so boned
[3:03:43] <bashful_bard> The plan
[3:03:43] <%dogwelder02> reggie taking the 20 min turns
[3:03:44] <%ekodrop> we good reggie
[3:03:44] <jubejube56> Guts never got off the boat
[3:03:44] <%Amaideus> You're totally right @TheDyingPride
[3:03:44] <%dollarstored> is this what being obscure feels like
[3:03:44] <%greatmonorail> minh needs to fight woolie instead of rico
[3:03:45] <YouKnowThatGuy1> Reggie should go to the magic spaces for Come Here
[3:03:45] <JeoDood> reggie filler are
[3:03:45] <mdkcde> Reggie gifted this game to Mihn
[3:03:46] <%ekodrop> it don't matter
[3:03:46] <DedlokPM> "Now we cut back to Guts and the gang on the boat"
[3:03:47] <+itsOnyxLeo> Reggie's not even playing the game anymore
[3:03:47] <+DesertPenguin> !uptime
[3:03:48] <gantzwasprettygood> Imagine being on team reggie
[3:03:48] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 3 minutes
[3:03:48] <Azaziz> FILLER ARC
[3:03:48] <+Dimfish> "i am so screwed" - reggie at hour 60
[3:03:49] <+xGreenflame> The Heroes kill each other directly in front of the evil lord for clout
[3:03:51] <%Amaideus> THIS IS GONNA BE A SHITSHOW
[3:03:51] <Jrocy247> Nah, Minh won't beat Rico, Minh is LOW HEALTH WITH BIG BUG EATING HIS REVIVAL
[3:03:51] <mdkcde> from the beginning
[3:03:51] <BurningSaph> Mihn's probably going to hope for a swoop in one turn win
[3:03:52] <crimsonsaens> How has Reggie not captured any of these towns?
[3:03:53] <%jiggy_snipe> Reggie wants to fight Wallace but Wallce is level 88
[3:03:53] <+Zenryoku21> Reggie not even playing the same game LUL
[3:03:53] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Reggie is the Great Tea Race
[3:03:55] <Zalthia> Reggie should just take towns now
[3:03:58] <samuraijakanddaxter> reggie arc is painful now
[3:04:00] <%soFISHticated98> is Reggie still pretending he's relevant
[3:04:01] <armchairmaster_> ResidentSleeper Reggie filler arc ResidentSleeper
[3:04:03] <%royb2> REggie, your only chance in any way is to contract
[3:04:04] <%Ipsenscastle> it wasn't the worst plan you've had
[3:04:04] <SethKyu> Towns were closed last week
[3:04:04] <%Daba_mk2> at this point keep gambling
[3:04:05] <Jrocy247> REGGIE THE HERO

[3:04:25] <+Mekhet09> if reggie was smart he could have captured the entire fucking map.
[3:04:26] <NeroInfinite> Reggie should just take towns
[3:04:27] <%Solidnick18> Skip
[3:04:29] <+cvp5127> reggie is playing a different game
[3:04:29] <Fanciful_Unicorn> I'm legit angry that Minh doesn't have to fight the guardian
[3:04:31] <Goat_Baka> Reggie came in WITH A PLAN
[3:04:32] <%SomersaultJustice> reggie learned the only way to win is to not play
[3:04:33] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> If Reggie gets a contract, and then does Come Here...
[3:04:35] <gantzwasprettygood> imagine being team reggir LUL
[3:04:36] <CobaltPhoenix27> The hero is running around in South America while the other two are in Hell

[4:05:07] <%AlteisenReiseZ> And now minh gets grenada
[4:05:07] <%soFISHticated98> how long does the stat drain remain?

[4:19:37] <%Irridium> Meanwhile
[4:19:37] <%Amaideus> He doesn't want items
[4:19:38] <%legacy0117> More money. Like Alchemists need it.
[4:19:39] <Mr_Ease> woolie literally just said it
[4:19:41] <+cvp5127> meanwhile
[4:19:41] <%Irridium> in South America
[4:19:41] <%Amaideus> So he can duplicate it
[4:19:41] <Jrocy247> Because Minh is GREEDY for MagicMedicine
[4:19:41] <%krispen_wa> He wants to keep his items as low as possible so he can dupe Magic Medicine
[4:19:43] <+zepelinnn1> Minh was never the hero LUL
[4:19:44] <YouKnowThatGuy1> Idk anymore
[4:19:45] <%jiggy_snipe> man these rolls are awful
[4:19:45] <%Amaideus> Come on guys
[4:19:45] <+SinisterStriker> Minh wants to dup the magic medicine so he can one shot
[4:19:46] <%royb2> MEANWHILE
[4:19:47] <%Th3SmartAlec> Miinh is over confident... Woolie still got a chance
[4:19:47] <crimsonsaens> Why wouldn't he want items?
[4:19:47] <armchairmaster_> Minh why?!
[4:19:50] <NickHatesSnow> what is with you two and the white space
[4:19:51] <superslacker> He's trying to trigger the dupe chat, pay attention
[4:19:53] <%dollarstored> minh literally had to steal the hero mantle
[4:19:54] <+nekodelic> MAGIC
[4:19:56] <ExileNineteen> i always wondered if the end of the LP was going to be duping magic medicine
[4:19:58] <%Grayhammatter> GRANADA
[4:20:00] <%jiggy_snipe> Minh only wants one item so he can dupe it
[4:20:00] <masterpoloko> back on planet reggie
[4:20:01] <%soFISHticated98> getting a revive is safer though
[4:20:01] <+Dimfish> he wants to dupe his magic meds
[4:20:01] <%royb2> @crimsonsaens He wants to duplicate magic medicine
[4:20:02] <+SaltyGhostRock> Filler Arc LUL
[4:20:02] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Minh admitted to not being the hero and nothing changed
[4:20:03] <%Fujiwara_92> Reggie wants teleports chat
[4:20:03] <jubejube56> Lol somehow reggie went from filler to main arc back to filler in the course of like 2 turns
[4:20:06] <Equirah> because he wants to guarantee he dupes the medicine
[4:20:07] <%jiggy_snipe> stay at Granada
[4:20:07] <+HelloImTom08> Fools, there are no heros in Dokapon
[4:20:08] <%krispen_wa> Re-invest in Granada
[4:20:09] <Mr_Ease> upgrade granada
[4:20:10] <+cvp5127> reggie gaiden
[4:20:12] <Ritei> minh should actually cap out items to be able to throw away the disguise
[4:20:12] <%Th3SmartAlec> What is Reggie even doing
[4:20:12] <ExpressNode> I like how this chat is so divided
[4:20:14] <Fanciful_Unicorn> inb4 5 cunning disguises
[4:20:15] <%soFISHticated98> like I know he wants to dupe magic medicine
[4:20:16] <SGrim> Imagine thinking Dokapon will end woopsKek

[4:26:02] <Solokaldaka> crreamBlank
[4:26:04] <nachohangovers> You can't win right now, your only shot will be hoping Minh can't land on the space. Otherwise he steals the kill.
[4:26:05] <%heartlesshealer> Minh is Gollum
[4:26:07] <%Fujiwara_92> Woolie is literally giving up NotLikeThis

[4:26:17] <TurtleButter> @Make_me_mad Accurate
[4:26:17] <LuckyTerry> MORE CRIMES
[4:26:17] <%tearknack> tbh, i kind of hate the anime/manga distinction; cause as someone who gets a lot out of facecam i have no interest in the anime,, that doesn't have it. the problem is they make the manga with the anime in mind, and lose out on some fun chat interaction
[4:26:19] <Sol_Install> he has a 50% chance tbh
[4:26:19] <%SchwaAkari> The power of DURGS!
[4:26:20] <+Solutha> he has costume too
[4:26:21] <+AsinPersuasion> reminder that everyone who donated to the blood pool payed to watch minh win
[4:26:22] <%heartlesshealer> don't lie, minh
[4:26:22] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @SaltyGhostRock ouch

[4:26:37] <%Th3SmartAlec> WOOLIE YOU LOSE IF YOU DO THAT
[4:26:38] <Kuubyy> HOW DOES THE STORY END
[4:26:40] <Jrocy247> Woolie is WILLING to let Minh take the kill. Because his Monologuing is TELLING HIM TO
[4:26:40] <%MrRabbles> if woolie lands an attack minh wins next turn if he rolls it
[4:26:40] <%plus_on_black> Overthinking is kicking your ass hard.
[4:26:41] <%Amaideus> This would be terrible if they interacted with the chat
[4:26:41] <%spiritofmojave> HIS HEEL SPEECH

[4:27:26] <rubbishbinge> Minh dies to one magic
[4:27:27] <%krispen_wa> Just game the Red Chest until you get Magic Medicine yourself
[4:27:28] <%GenesisKnight> It says double HP

[4:27:55] <DedlokPM> @fruit_pie_the_magician if you can't stand the thinking then why even bother watching an lp of a freaking STRATEGY BOARD GAME. THINKING THINGS THROUGH IS PART OF THE EXPERIENCE
[4:27:56] <Monkeyweed21> SIDE EFFECTS
[4:27:57] <%heroversusofficial> LET HIM DIE
[4:27:58] <huskarl_zap> Woolie you can strike first just shoot him
[4:27:58] <%emperordread> Get dokapon Crown then double it
[4:27:58] <flyingtentaclemonster> What does conjure all do btw?
[4:28:01] <%alpacasintophats> health is a stat too
[4:28:01] <+BizarreRevolver> bide your time woolz
[4:28:01] <%kapcommunist> does only last place get the item duplicate?
[4:28:02] <The_err0r> Woolie can predict because he fought this form

[4:28:06] <SGrim> Go in, strike, ???, profit. roo7
[4:28:08] <%legacy0117> WOOLIE YOU GOTTA OUT ALCHEMIST MINH THE ALCHEMIST.
[4:28:10] <YouKnowThatGuy1> Side effects aint that bad tho
[4:28:10] <%Grayhammatter> side effects would cripple him if he doesn't one shot
[4:28:11] <BurdRightsActivist> @DedlokPM Don't tell me what to do. :)
[4:28:13] <+hawk_rush> STRIKE
[4:28:14] <Jrocy247> The Side Effect. Is that he has about a WEEK to kill the boss
[4:28:17] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie, if Minh can't be stopped, then why make it easier for Minh?'
[4:28:18] <%topendbuzza> woolie fight boss
[4:28:21] <+bizzer10> this game needs a turn timer
[4:28:21] <+Gondab> What's conjour all?

[4:28:31] <ExileNineteen> @Grayhammatter those side effects take too long to kick in, magic medicine is absolutely busted in this situation
[4:28:31] <DedlokPM> @BurdRightsActivist Then don't tell woolie what to do. It is not your stream
[4:28:32] <+TomDanksEGOT> there are side effects though, and I bet it has something pretty serious/ridic
[4:28:33] <MusouMiko> yeah like I'm p sure minh will kill him within a w eek
[4:28:33] <%Amaideus> @kapcommunist The alchemist class has it happen at random
[4:28:35] <%C4m3r0n0409> Woolie cant make decisions while mind fucked
[4:28:36] <%royb2> @Th3SmartAlec He can avoid that with SOulfiring for 2 turns
[4:28:36] <%emperordread> Unless ... woolieSHOOK
[4:28:37] <Make_me_mad> This game should absolutely penalize you at the end for taking long turns.

[4:30:59] <DedlokPM> @jiggy_snipe Thing is, even with being an aclhemist, he still needs to get the items to dupe. He can't rely on waiting on double rng when minh has most of what he would need now
[4:31:02] <%soFISHticated98> white chest man
[4:31:03] <Twistedwolfie> this is so dumb woolie has no chance aggainst minh if they both farm

[4:31:39] <Xeno351> smart
[4:31:40] <%heartlesshealer> bye good item
[4:31:40] <%jiggy_snipe> @DedlokPM which is fine but it seemed like he was gonna talk himself into attacking Rico. If Minh is gonna do it let him, don't make it easier for him
[4:31:40] <SGrim> But you dodge everything anyway
[4:31:41] <JeoDood> 300 def minh chat
[4:31:41] <%soFISHticated98> yeah but your dodge is too high
[4:31:41] <rubbishbinge> Does Rico's field magic count?

[4:31:43] <masterpoloko> smart
[4:31:44] <ajrmeps2> ????????????
[4:31:45] <%Amaideus> It's techincally possible, just really unlikely

[4:31:48] <+Dimfish> woolie could get field magic in here

[4:31:55] <%Grayhammatter> oof
[4:31:56] <+cvp5127> meanwhile
[4:31:56] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie can potentally kill Minh if he plays his cards right
[4:31:56] <roarofdamnation> the only danger here is if Minh doesn't manages to fight Rico before Magic Medicine wears out, it is a risky gamble, he has to land in the space.
[4:31:57] <worldbrand> I guess he doesnt need it with the medicine

[4:35:23] <huskarl_zap> @optimasmaximas Minecraftearth they're called

[4:35:26] <gryffinp> minh uses come here on reggie, reggie goes ahead and beats the boss while woolie and minh are losing their minds, reggie wins, roll credits
[4:35:27] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> Take a town
[4:35:27] <KeroKamina> GET A TOWN
[4:35:27] <+sphiraki> I had to switch to my computer - did woolie just die?
[4:35:33] <%Kazuhira_Boat> red chest to lose money reggie
[4:35:33] <zocano> Reggie can win if he gets enough towns in time
[4:35:40] <%plus_on_black> Minh is PS5 chilling waiting fir Xbox to move.
[4:35:40] <FeralRageGaming> no body died
[4:35:40] <worldbrand> Woolie aint dead yet
[4:35:42] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @sphiraki on the inside
[4:35:43] <roarofdamnation> Reggie should become an alchemist and got to casino cave
[4:35:44] <%SomersaultJustice> I hope reggie realizes to get towns
[4:35:44] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @lionkevinson its predetermined it doesnt matter
[4:35:46] <+AsinPersuasion> how many has he gotten so far though <_<
[4:35:46] <+Dimfish> woolie is dying on the inside, not the outside yet
[4:35:48] <%tearknack> @sphiraki woolie is slowly dying on the inside
[4:35:48] <%MrRabbles> if reggie takes the map he can probably win
[4:35:49] <%DaBigVitus> well there's at least one more stream to go
[4:35:49] <$SilverRoddo> So, is the real game, just the loop at the very end?
[4:35:50] <bashful_bard> Woolie taking his time

[4:35:57] <arkv01> when reggie wins I am going to nut the hardest in my entire life
[4:35:58] <morningmoondude> I think by now Woolie has convinced himself that his only chance is to let Mihn do what he wants and hope he can steal the kill
[4:35:58] <%greatmonorail> anyone a fan of the #FillerArc? Aka Reggies turns? (he's probs going to win)
[4:35:59] <Xeno351> reggie could actually win this depending on how long this cold war lasts

[4:37:42] <%Struggleful> Woolie Broken
[4:37:42] <aluddss> you were merely borrowing it from minh
[4:37:42] <redstrawherring> Woolie's Cult of Truth getting repped real hard right now
[4:37:42] <%C4m3r0n0409> GRINDED
[4:37:42] <RurouniGeo> Choosing Green Spaces over Red spaces you can't complain about luck
[4:37:45] <megamonmon123> take the town reggie
[4:37:46] <%heroversusofficial> Minh picked up the napkin first
[4:37:46] <morningmoondude> Being Woolie Is Suffering
[4:37:47] <+Solutha> would minh even fight if woolie left
[4:37:47] <Shinny1338> No luck Woolie it's a set seed
[4:37:48] <+hawk_rush> you need to pray harder woolie Kappa
[4:37:48] <%soFISHticated98> Reggie should take Amazon
[4:37:48] <%SchwaAkari> Woolie those shields have a 1-in-10 to land even when they do show up on white spaces
[4:37:48] <%DaBigVitus> shoulda gone red
[4:37:49] <Twistedwolfie> no shit, he has better speed and magic
[4:37:50] <aiutare47> Hoes mad (x46)
[4:37:51] <ExileNineteen> i think, at this point, it would have been better if woolie had LOST to the door guard
[4:37:52] <%soFISHticated98> get those bezoos bucks
[4:37:52] <+doc_ock_rokc> Mihn can't win no matter what
[4:37:54] <SGrim> Steal all them fuckin' town Reggie. YOU GOT THIS!
[4:37:54] <%spiritofmojave> Minh grabbed the final napkin
[4:37:54] <%jiggy_snipe> lol
[4:37:55] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @PirateHunter99 woolie has no shield and boss is chunky
[4:37:55] <%DashXero> Woolie got tunnel vision
[4:37:57] <Zalthia> And he still hasn’t drunk the thing
[4:37:58] <%jiggy_snipe> Woolie it's fine
[4:37:58] <+SaltyGhostRock> We need the coliseum LUL
[4:38:00] <PleasantLeech> CHANCE
[4:38:00] <%Sheepwalk> Reggie just be vibing
[4:38:01] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> @lukewarmholiday Same, sadly
[4:38:03] <%MrRabbles> no one has a decisive win on rico
[4:38:05] <%krispen_wa> Reggie will grind the towns until he wins
[4:38:06] <%heartlesshealer> Reggie: Hero of the People
[4:38:06] <%SchwaAkari> Relying on luck is not how you win a fighting game and you should know that
[4:38:06] <gantzwasprettygood> “I didn’t role 1 out of 16, damn!”
[4:38:07] <JetpackMcQuack> It's easier for Mihn to hurt woolie, than for Woolie to get what he needs
[4:38:07] <%jiggy_snipe> Minh still has to try and idk if he will
[4:38:08] <+KENTASHIRO> The best is going to be if Minh gets the kill but Reggie gets the W because they're fucking around so much
[4:38:09] <hawmaro95> Luck is a skill LUL
[4:38:10] <%C4m3r0n0409> Reggie please go for Rico
[4:38:10] <%ChoculaUltra> Reggie has turned the topside world into his hyperbolic time chamber. But it's on fire.
[4:38:11] <+cvp5127> YES
[4:38:13] <+hawk_rush> you gotta do the red
[4:38:14] <thesickestzak> Should've gone red Kappa
[4:38:16] <PirateHunter99> thx
[4:38:18] <Zalthia> Woolie, just walk away. Minh will fail.
[4:38:19] <Shinny1338> @saltyghostrock Lmao that would be anazing

[4:38:23] <waifoong98> should have pump in LCK Kappa
[4:38:25] <TigerClaws12> STONKS
[4:38:25] <+doc_ock_rokc> Mihn is too cowardly to fight the boss woolie
[4:38:26] <+itsOnyxLeo> Woolie you could have left, bought an Africa shield and 4spinners, and gotten back to the boss room in the time it took for you to run around in circles! C'mon man!
[4:38:27] <%legacy0117> IF collisuem happens I will be so happy. Jebaited

[4:38:36] <+hawk_rush> you have to do the red
[4:38:37] <masterpoloko> poor reggie
[4:38:40] <The_err0r> Woolie you could have not been a coward and fight Rico when you still had the luck
[4:38:41] <+hawk_rush> dokapon demands it
[4:38:41] <%Jetzord> Woolie has gone full Reggie with the mental footsies he's playing against himself
[4:38:42] <gantzwasprettygood> Just get the crown nerd

[4:39:08] <Josef_Stryker> RIP
[4:39:08] <%SchwaAkari> Death Call would have been WIIIILD
[4:39:08] <MaverickJoker> LUL
[4:39:10] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[4:39:10] <BurdRightsActivist> D OMEGALUL DGE NECKL- oh fuck that would've been close
[4:39:11] <+hawk_rush> DUDE
[4:39:13] <%allups> no collusion
[4:39:13] <%spiritofmojave> Death call would've been rad
[4:39:13] <%kyh9> Why can't Woolie just get good luck?
[4:39:14] <NickHatesSnow> serum would have fixed his curse
[4:39:20] <%SuperKirby24> monkaS
[4:39:21] <Shinny1338> Did Woolie ever see what Conjure all does?
[4:39:21] <%soFISHticated98> atrophy on bos
[4:39:21] <%SomersaultJustice> ?????????
[4:39:22] <BurdRightsActivist> WOOLIE
[4:39:24] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Woolie should pray more
[4:39:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> Why is Rico not doing shit
[4:39:27] <%heartlesshealer> you never fought, so you don't know
[4:39:28] <crimsonsaens> Elixir first would've been better
[4:39:31] <Twistedwolfie> go attakc now
[4:39:32] <ExileNineteen> woolie has had good luck on exactly one occasion this session, and that was when his gun procced and killed the guard
[4:39:36] <Kuubyy> PRAY MOTHERFUCKER
[4:39:41] <thesickestzak> Rico feels too bad to do anything
[4:39:41] <ExileNineteen> and that situation led him directly into this one
[4:39:47] <Zalthia> Rico is just waiting
[4:39:53] <@akuda_bar> rico taking a nap
[4:39:55] <%royb2> @ExileNineteen And even that HELPED Minh
[4:39:58] <BurdRightsActivist> Rico will wait 25 turns
[4:39:58] <%Irridium> Reggie in his own world
[4:40:05] <masterpoloko> this is sad
[4:40:06] <%Amaideus> Friendly notification, I'm gonna put up another poll on the subreddit AS SOON AS THIS ENDS
[4:40:06] <ExileNineteen> @royb2 yeah exactly, it opened up the final room for minh
[4:40:09] <%dollarstored> reggies turns are just lifeless
[4:40:11] <Fanciful_Unicorn> This is just Naruto. Woolie is Rock Lee, working hard to grind levels and trying to attain victory, while Minh is Naruto, the chosen child who is destined to win
[4:40:12] <+ultimafullmetal> Kinda wish Rico would just chase you guys down
[4:40:13] <NickHatesSnow> I'm happy Reggie's turns are here to break up the tension tbh
[4:40:14] <%korth367> blood pool was a mistake
[4:40:16] <Make_me_mad> Dokapon ins Minh's kingdom. You all just live in it.
[4:40:16] <%MrRabbles> this is a reggie world and we all live in it
[4:40:17] <%C4m3r0n0409> Reggie could probably kill rico first at this point
[4:40:21] <+AsinPersuasion> its hard to tell reggie is playing the same game on the same map
[4:40:27] <Ritei> blood pool was the biggest mistake
[4:40:28] <armchairmaster_> Reggie is literally stuck in africs LUL
[4:40:30] <%legacy0117> Also a loop of non-combat spaces almost guaranteed this kind of thing to happen. But at least it keeps the players in the endgame.
[4:40:30] <%tearknack> @Fanciful_Unicorn whose reggie though
[4:40:43] <%dollarstored> LOL
[4:40:43] <Fanciful_Unicorn> Choji
[4:40:48] <%dollarstored> Reggie with first world problems
[4:40:51] <masterpoloko> make a comeback
[4:40:54] <%SomersaultJustice> yeyeye punch that ghost

[4:41:02] <snowcastleframe> Reggie = Sakura confirmed
[4:41:03] <%TheBenson8r> WHERE YOU AT GHOST
[4:41:03] <zocano> Reggie can absolutely win if he gets enough time to get towns
[4:41:05] <%jiggy_snipe> he should take every town before he leaves but I feel like he'll just peace out once he gets the store
[4:41:09] <ExileNineteen> @snowcastleframe LUL
[4:41:10] <redstrawherring> @c4m3r0n0409 Reggie's just embodying the spirit of Nintendocaprisun
[4:41:11] <%Grayhammatter> reggie just needs to get himself the towns on the map
[4:41:12] <Fanciful_Unicorn> LUL Sakura Reggie
[4:41:16] <%heartlesshealer> !

[4:43:00] <+kknutson4> Woolie needs to go in the door and kill some monsters to use up the reveals
[4:43:01] <%royb2> Watch the curse kill Woolie just as he's about to win against Rico
[4:43:03] <+shinichizio> Push Minh for Summer Slam
[4:43:03] <waifoong98> Monopolise them all...
[4:43:03] <%emperordread> you got a town to invest in right there
[4:43:04] <%spiritofmojave> Reggie deserves to win after all these filler arcs
[4:43:06] <+blademaster247> At least Reggie won't be last
[4:43:07] <ExileNineteen> even though i'm wrong like every 10 mins on the shit i say in this chat Kappa
[4:43:07] <%jiggy_snipe> do not leave SA until you get all those towns
[4:43:07] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli fuck. that's on point
[4:43:08] <bobbyratlair> Reggie is Claude, so who’s Dimitri and who’s Edelgard?
[4:43:09] <worldbrand> you can actually win by actually being a real hero
[4:43:10] <%kekkerscrew> C4m3r0n0409 Reggie is in first place. If he captures enough towns it won't matter who beats rico.
[4:43:12] <%tearknack> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli reggie will open the BEST takoyaki stand
[4:43:12] <%Grayhammatter> invest in balboa
[4:43:15] <funwashere> cant you just use the contract?

[4:43:22] <WG101> @bobbyratlair Minh is 100% Edelgard
[4:43:23] <%Fujiwara_92> WOOLIE JUST NEEDS A SHIELD NOW PogChamp
[4:43:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> @kknutson4 I suspect Woolie is sitting such that he can't avoid seeing it every now and then
[4:43:26] <%SuperKirby24> ... anyone else's blood pressure at max? Just me? Kappa
[4:43:26] <%C4m3r0n0409> Reggie is barely in first atm tho
[4:43:27] <+prime_name> @bobbyratlair Minh is Edlegard, Woolie is Dimitri
[4:43:27] <%topendbuzza> none no one is looking at chat
[4:43:28] <roarofdamnation> Man being Team Reggie must suck
[4:43:33] <%Jpshum> invest in balboa
[4:43:34] <Lionkevinson> how much is the peace pool?

[4:43:37] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> They barely read chat to preserve the anime
[4:43:39] <%plus_on_black> You guys need to eat something.
[4:43:39] <thesickestzak> Reggie got greedy and ruined his own plan.
[4:43:39] <Mr_Ease> in fact theres no need for him to proc the dupe, just use it, soul fire, then he has priority
[4:43:40] <%djazo> WOOLIE YOU CAN WIN NOW
[4:43:40] <ExileNineteen> peace pool was like 1.6k
[4:43:43] <%soFISHticated98> Minh is Claude, because he is calculating
[4:43:43] <%Th3SmartAlec> inb4 Blackmail
[4:43:43] <Make_me_mad> @WG101 You're right. He is the best and deserves to win.
[4:43:49] <Lionkevinson> Thanks
[4:43:50] <%DaBigVitus> reggie needs to move it, the real game waits
[4:43:55] <armchairmaster_> ResidentSleeper
[4:43:57] <%soFISHticated98> Woolie is Dimitri, made blind by rage and depression
[4:43:58] <Robot_Nixon_> why read chat, its just full of salt
[4:43:59] <%kekkerscrew> Yes he's barely in first. But this is his best chancem there's no way he can get to heck before they beat Rico

[4:50:30] <%soFISHticated98> you don't need space to dupe

[4:50:39] <%spiritofmojave> @hawk_rush it is really striking
[4:50:40] <NickHatesSnow> reggie should just take all their towns tbh
[4:50:40] <ExileNineteen> there's no yomi coming from minh, he doesn't have to. woolie blew the medicine way too soon and now has very predictable turns
[4:50:41] <%jiggy_snipe> just get them no downside

[4:51:01] <Idon__> Reggie is digging that hole deeper
[4:51:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> @soFISHticated98 I think the idea is that having less items means its mroe likely you dupe what you want
[4:51:03] <thesickestzak> These big important Reggie turns are the best
[4:51:04] <zocano> Reggie can take the win if he gets enough towns
[4:51:05] <%MrRabbles> Reggie can still win
[4:51:05] <%kekkerscrew> Get the continent then town warp
[4:51:06] <Goat_Baka> Woolie activated Night Guy before finding Madara
[4:51:07] <+cvp5127> NotLikeThis
[4:51:07] <Zalthia> Being team Reggie is suffering
[4:51:08] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @MrBorisMakarov he fought wallace and got first. just doing town clean up + investing now
[4:51:09] <GDandy> filler arc NotLikeThis
[4:51:10] <realapothe> why is Reggie wasting everyone's time? you threw away your only shot son
[4:51:13] <+InfiniteHav0k> If Reggie can get every town before someone beats the boss he will win
[4:51:13] <Shinny1338> @alteisenreisez Get rich or die tryibg
[4:51:13] <%Mrthefro> Could you imagine if Reggie wins because the gap is too big at the end.
[4:51:13] <SenhorGordon> What if Rico 3rd form?
[4:51:14] <+Dimfish> @jiggy_snipe i think team woolie is having a harder night tbh
[4:51:14] <+zepelinnn1> ,
[4:51:15] <DerpioParty> If he gets enough towns he may be able to take whatever the reward for Rico is
[4:51:16] <%Grayhammatter> oh my god
[4:51:16] <%Th3SmartAlec> If Reggie wins...
[4:51:17] <%kekkerscrew> NOOO
[4:51:17] <Jrocy247> LET WOOLIE FOCUS. He needs it

[5:27:45] <ExpressNode> Should have striked
[5:27:47] <Daxalog> "Auto Counter"
[5:27:49] <+KENTASHIRO> Happy you guys didn't kill each other
[5:27:50] <$arcielardor> NEW GAME PLUS TIME
[5:27:51] <%primax104> Minh the Hewo!
[5:27:53] <heroicspiritavenger> It's over guys, it's all downhill from here
[5:27:53] <huskarl_zap> PAT AND V NEXT
[5:27:53] <%SchwaAkari> Woolie's play should have been Soul Fire -> Give Up as soon as the potion ended, not Attack -> Give Up
[5:27:54] <+Invlux> You did this? I did this.
[5:27:54] <%Kriss1827> Woolie was literally 1 turn away from winning
[5:27:55] <%Sheepwalk> This wasn't just an LP, this was an experience.
[5:27:55] <derap41> Dokapon failed to ruin friendships
[5:27:56] <+agumon9000> @WoolieVersus You did it way too early
[5:27:56] <lotharrio> Woolie's failure: Soul Fire. Reggie's failure: Not grabbing towns unimpeded.
[5:27:57] <%primax104> *Hero
[5:27:57] <+McGwinnicus> So close :(
[5:27:57] <henshin2289> And Woolie will forever regret not striking.
[5:27:58] <heroicspiritavenger> Woolie Vs. has peaked
[5:27:58] <%DaBigVitus> he WOULD have won if he didnt soul fire. amazing
[5:27:59] <YakumoYomi> If Woolie had killed Rico, would Reggie have won or would the towns be enough for Woolie to win?
[5:27:59] <atema128> What a ride.
[5:28:00] <%legacy0117> Because the magic medicine was a random dup chance
[5:28:01] <%djazo> THIS LP WAS AMAZING
[5:28:02] <$QueequegTheater> WOOLIE PAT, V, AND MAX
[5:28:03] <Ritei> @WoolieVersus theres hidden credits on the map as an easter egg
[5:28:03] <thesickestzak> Should've struck NotLikeThis
[5:28:03] <Dalkalopagus> Fantastic playthrough
[5:28:04] <thewrathofscience> leave it to woolie to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory
[5:28:04] <%Diana869> Not even in fighting games woolie couldn't get out of pools
[5:28:05] <$QueequegTheater> SEASON 2
[5:28:05] <emeraldskrull> woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO
[5:28:06] <+Mr_Brocktoon_Belvedere> This was the Superbowl of lp's lads, thank the three heroes behind it!
[5:28:11] <%Amaideus> Who the fuck was that pink haired character?
[5:28:13] <%heartlesshealer> Soul Fire was the worst move though
[5:28:14] <DiscoDur0> and then he gave up
[5:28:15] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Rolls fucked you, Woolie, You honestly had that.
[5:28:15] <+DesertPenguin> Woolie you're thinking too much instead of simply doing
[5:28:16] <%legacy0117> And Woolie popped too soon.
[5:28:16] <%iamwood99> thank you woolie
[5:28:17] <%darthvaderwasasimp> Woolie is the vegeta of his own channel confirmed
[5:28:18] <%topendbuzza> 1hp
[5:28:20] <%jiggy_snipe> Rico auto-counters so striking was not the play
[5:28:20] <+DesertPenguin> Soul Fire was useless, just attack
[5:28:20] <Zalthia> I’m so tired
[5:28:21] <%Diana869> a*
[5:28:21] <ExileNineteen> @Amaideus that's a player char
[5:28:22] <%C4m3r0n0409> Soul fire was dumb
[5:28:22] <%primax104> that was some good shit man
[5:28:25] <armchairmaster_> Woolie to Minh: Mio-Mio, this is the last of my Hamon!
[5:28:26] <crimsonsaens> Woolie should've moved to a better position first or just attack first
[5:28:29] <Jrocy247> Minh, who BARELY did main story missions. Trolled the ENTIRE game. Screwed around the most. Won the game at the end......Christ..... NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[5:28:30] <ExileNineteen> @Amaideus pink derpy alchy girl
[5:28:30] <+DesertPenguin> should have just attacked from the start
[5:28:30] <%Irridium> the attack wouldn't have killed, the revert would have happened
[5:28:33] <Zalthia> I’m so tired. I’m going to get food.
[5:28:33] <%SomersaultJustice> the soul fire was a bad idea
[5:28:33] <FeralRageGaming> eighth gate, lasts one week
[5:28:34] <Idon__> THAT BLUE LINE IS MINH LUL
[5:28:35] <bevyrage> holy shit wallace was in the intro the whole time!?
[5:28:35] <+bear_breaker20> s t i n g
[5:28:38] <%CursedNobleman> ALL HAIL MINH.
[5:28:39] <%Kriss1827> 1 TURN AWAY FROM WINNING
[5:28:39] <CobaltPhoenix27> Honestly woolie didn't do anything wrong up until he landed on rico. he got unlucky with his rolls after drinking the potion
[5:28:40] <%phatmac16> THAT WOULD'VE BEEN A GREAT END
[5:28:42] <Kuubyy> It's all over.
[5:28:42] <+DesertPenguin> yea you can, you let minh steal it
[5:28:42] <%Amaideus> I take those, thanks y'all
[5:28:43] <%0rond> 750 did a bit over half, 999 wouldn't have killed
[5:28:44] <derap41> The True Victory is that you didn't en up hating each other
[5:28:44] <BurdRightsActivist> @Jrocy247 Undertaker wins
[5:28:45] <%stote45> that shit was epic
[5:28:45] <masterp_91> @Jrocy247 yeah, shit sucks
[5:28:45] <%C4m3r0n0409> Woolie should have just not attacked
[5:28:46] <%dogwelder02> Woolie, you had the win. Stop monologuing
[5:28:46] <thewrathofscience> all woolie had to do is strike
[5:28:48] <+Zayasu> intro spoiled minh winning Kappa
[5:28:48] <Aydarkzero> the intro knew!
[5:28:50] <%iswearimjustdandy> I have never felt this much disappointment in my life, it was worth it
[5:28:50] <@Solidus_113> Imagine if you striked
[5:28:52] <gantzwasprettygood> Game’s over chat, don’t worry about the “should haves”
[5:28:53] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> Should have just started by attacking
[5:28:54] <MaverickJoker> GG
[5:28:54] <SenhorGordon> If you had the gun, the thunder could've killed him
[5:28:54] <%Amaideus> He should've waited one more turn to get closer
[5:28:54] <Camail> side effect is 1 hp
[5:28:55] <+SaltyGhostRock> Woolie was right
[5:28:55] <OhNoAndrej> magnificent LP

[5:28:56] <+Saggitori> What is mihn going to spend his blood money on?
[5:28:56] <%Fujiwara_92> WOOLIE ONLY MISTAKE WAS POPING TOO EARLY, BUT HE GOT SOME GOOD HITS IN

[5:30:25] <ExileNineteen> @ExpressNode 4k to minh, woolie and reggie split the peace pool for around $800 each
[5:30:25] <MaverickJoker> DIO MINH WINS
[5:30:25] <%countgaculatv> Minh was right, fuck being a hero.
[5:30:27] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Glad I watched this. I can't trust people to stfu about this finale
[5:30:28] <%greatmonorail> How are people thinking that minh didn't know one thing and now didn't deserve to win
[5:30:28] <SGrim> Woolie, if you'd countered and won. That would have been magic.
[5:30:28] <%Kriss1827> We were the real winners here chat lets be honest
[5:30:28] <Jrocy247> You should've kept the gun
[5:30:28] <%tearknack> @ExpressNode there wasn't a bet, its a pool of chat donations
[5:30:29] <RurouniGeo> @f4ntom98 or because he read the youtube comments and got tips and information Reggie and Woolie didn't have
[5:30:29] <%TheBenson8r> That 1 was GOAT, but then... ye
[5:30:29] <%Daba_mk2> the soul fire man
[5:30:29] <NickHatesSnow> but you didn't risk the dodge
[5:30:30] <%jiggy_snipe> even then Reggie just needed to take towns while they were in heck
[5:30:30] <+BizarreRevolver> should have kept gun
[5:30:31] <rubbishbinge> No damage multiplier on the doka sword gg
[5:30:34] <%alpacasintophats> Y'all saying Hoes Mad and all. Y'all are correct. I AM AN EXTREMELY MAD HOE!
[5:30:34] <armchairmaster_> Minh- Kappa Reggie- ResidentSleeper Woolie- NotLikeThis
[5:30:35] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I had a feeling Minh would win, but alas, I was Team Reggie
[5:30:35] <CobaltPhoenix27> guys relax i didin't want Minh to win but in the end the bad rolls led to where we're at
[5:30:36] <%CursedNobleman> Nobody remembers Might Guy. Everyone remembers Naruto and Sasuke. Bitch breaks his legs and doesnt even get a statue.
[5:30:36] <heroicspiritavenger> Bans?
[5:30:39] <RetroCop87> That feel when you realize that Woolie would have won if he striked instead of attacked
[5:30:42] <%heroversusofficial> If he had kept the gun
[5:30:42] <huskarl_zap> OBITO WON
[5:30:42] <%SchwaAkari> Also if Woolie had not soul-fired at all he'd have probably been able to two-shot with his Reveals and win
[5:30:45] <+el_boney> Minh didn't win, Woolie lost for everyone
[5:30:47] <%Grayhammatter> i'm more disappointed in reggie
[5:30:47] <%heroversusofficial> He might've gotten the double hit
[5:30:48] <+cvp5127> evil wins
[5:30:49] <@Moobot> Easy with the emojis @samuraijakanddaxter
[5:30:50] <JeoDood> if woolie keep the gun he could double shot it
[5:30:51] <%soFISHticated98> @RetroCop87 auto counter idiot
[5:30:51] <masterp_91> @el_boney this
[5:30:51] <%AlteisenReiseZ> This honestly might just go down in LP history
[5:30:51] <worldbrand> minh's going to get into smash before woolie at this point
[5:30:52] <+BubbaRands> Sometimes the Villain wins...
[5:30:54] <+AsinPersuasion> why aren't people allowed to be mad their team didn't win
[5:30:54] <xxshadowxx416> coward minh wins
[5:30:56] <MaverickJoker> Exactly, EVIL WINS
[5:30:59] <CrypticMochi> Commission character statues
[5:30:59] <%soFISHticated98> all the bosses automatically counter your strikes
[5:31:02] <SenhorGordon> The soul fire made you lose sadly
[5:31:02] <%jiggy_snipe> @Grayhammatter that's how Team Reggie feels
[5:31:02] <MaverickJoker> TRUE HERO MINH WINS Kappa
[5:31:03] <%primax104> Good game guys
[5:31:03] <Xeno351> I SO HAPPY LUL
[5:31:03] <zocano> Evil has won.
[5:31:04] <+DesertPenguin> I'm mad that Minh won it the way he did
[5:31:05] <%soFISHticated98> you literally cannot strike them
[5:31:05] <+AsinPersuasion> let the people seethe
[5:31:06] <ExileNineteen> be mad, don't be toxic
[5:31:06] <%greatmonorail> Woolie couldn't have striked, lol chat is dumb
[5:31:07] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> THIS IS HOW BERSERK ENDS
[5:31:08] <masterp_91> Woolie could have won be he felt bad.
[5:31:09] <+DesertPenguin> Like a little shit
[5:31:09] <%Fujiwara_92> THIS ANIME ENDED FOR ME WHEN WOOLIE HIT THE 1
[5:31:09] <dickbuttwoman> He has auto-counter confirmed
[5:31:10] <aluddss> this chat PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[5:31:11] <OhNoAndrej> Superb LP, guys! Congrats on completing it!
[5:31:11] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> GRIFFITH WINS
[5:31:12] <%tearknack> @AsinPersuasion you can be amd, but don't be a shit about it
[5:31:13] <%nintega010> @WoolieVersus I'm still on your team woolie It was a fun ride
[5:31:13] <+paulblart1911> 2020 SUCKS
[5:31:14] <DiscoDur0> Dokapon netplay is now at its peak
[5:31:14] <Camail> you'd have to restrict the counter
[5:31:14] <%primax104> Instant classic LP
[5:31:16] <Jrocy247> Yea, I think Woolie should've kept the Gun. He had that chance for the extra damage.
[5:31:18] <NickHatesSnow> #TeamMinh4TheWin
[5:31:18] <worldbrand> the boss 100% has auto-counter, as do most bosses
[5:31:19] <MaverickJoker> GRIFFITH DID NOTHING WRONG
[5:31:23] <%Kriss1827> @Fujiwara_92 AGREED
[5:31:25] <bashful_bard> All the bosses major auto counter
[5:31:25] <%C4m3r0n0409> Woolie doing dumb shit threw the game
[5:31:25] <CobaltPhoenix27> Holy fuck people still think Strike was an option? Guys the boss auto counters. All bosses auto counter.
[5:31:26] <%Struggleful> Smasher level's of irrational anger LUL
[5:31:27] <+Mekhet09> The problem is the second soul fire.
[5:31:27] <MaverickJoker> LUL
[5:31:27] <JeoDood> TEAM MINH
[5:31:28] <RetroCop87> @soFISHticated98 dial back the salt a bit, ya?
[5:31:29] <%dogwelder02> Woolie shouldn't have hit the boss at all
[5:31:32] <%SchwaAkari> Dokapon Kingdom SECOND GIG LET'S GO
[5:31:32] <lotharrio> Minh still won by the strategy we all knew he was using.
[5:31:33] <%SuperKirby24> I'm assuming the anime ended when woolie rolled the one Kappa
[5:31:36] <Fanciful_Unicorn> @samuraijakanddaxter wouldn't matter, woulda taken half his health, maybe and then he would be back to original attack and not hit hard enough to kill
[5:31:37] <%soFISHticated98> salt? I am on top of the world
[5:31:38] <sorakirosaki1> this match has been awesome
[5:31:38] <%greatmonorail> #TeamMinhWinh
[5:31:39] <%jiggy_snipe> LP was great. Would have been better Reggie and Woolie played like Minh
[5:31:39] <%soFISHticated98> Minh won
[5:31:40] <RenegadeEpsilon> wools won in my heart
[5:31:41] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Minh, please buy the Night Guy statue with the blood pool
[5:31:42] <ExpressNode> Welp that was fun regardless, game guys
[5:31:42] <%spiritofmojave> I was surprised about the towns being basically worthless to acquire as long as someone beats Rico
[5:31:43] <%Fujiwara_92> NOW I WANNA A NIGHT WOOLIE STATUE
[5:31:43] <+BubbaRands> So when do I get a t-shirt for this? Kappa
[5:31:44] <tritachyon> this LP will definitely go down in history
[5:31:46] <%soFISHticated98> #Minh4theWin
[5:31:48] <JeoDood> Minh still won by the strategy we all knew he was using
[5:31:49] <huskarl_zap> The dark millennium has begun
[5:31:50] <%legacy0117> It was just a lack of patience tbh.
[5:31:51] <%dogwelder02> taking it down to half health was a terrible idea
[5:31:53] <%kapcommunist> it came down to using the magic potion 1 turn too early
[5:31:55] <Camail> reggie fucked up going for the local item value
[5:31:55] <DarkestDom> rbeeG rbeeG rbeeG rbeeG rbeeG rbeeG rbeeG rbeeG rbeeG rbeeG
[5:31:56] <gastherobots> Woolie would have won if he landed. Reggie would have won if he just took the ice towns. But Minh knew the game, Minh knew when and where to be.
[5:31:57] <+Velloriaa> Worth staying up till 1am for
[5:31:57] <+AnthraxJohnson> #Minh4TheWin
[5:31:58] <+shuratheawesome> Good job on the lp guys! You all are real champs for sticking with it!
[5:31:59] <%soFISHticated98> I've been saying this shit since the lava cave days
[5:32:03] <The_err0r> Btw I’m pretty sure Rico doesn’t auto counter
[5:32:05] <kkjingles> Minh becomes a dictator
[5:32:06] <%gatorafan> This last sesion on YouTube is going to be wild
[5:32:07] <+DesertPenguin> HE should have healed, that shit is fucking busted
[5:32:08] <armchairmaster_> Minh must use the Blood Money to buy a statue of Guy activating the 8th Gate
[5:32:08] <+paulblart1911> THE DARK AGE BEGINS
[5:32:10] <ExileNineteen> @spiritofmojave i don't understand. if reggie would have been taking more towns he'd have won
[5:32:13] <Decimated_body> #MinhforWin
[5:32:13] <%Fujiwara_92> WHERE'S MY NIGHT POCKETS STATUE WITH THE END ON IT
[5:32:15] <Jrocy247> Minh won by Trolling. That was he strategy the ENTIRE game. LUL
[5:32:15] <samuraijakanddaxter> anyway congrats minh he played the smartest throughout
[5:32:18] <%pietrowaffleton> he def autocounters
[5:32:18] <ExileNineteen> towns are the whole game
[5:32:18] <%Struggleful> Woolie and Reggie were playing kinda dumb a lot of the time
[5:32:24] <gantzwasprettygood> lol @ chat going “woolie/reggie should’ve” game’s over lads
[5:32:27] <%CursedNobleman> NO MORE HEROES.
[5:32:28] <nothuzad> #MihMaxing
[5:32:28] <%soFISHticated98> #minh4thewin
[5:32:29] <Fanciful_Unicorn> Reggie definitely could have won had he just taken all the towns
[5:32:30] <bashful_bard> Minh would've won even if woolie hadn't hurt Rico
[5:32:32] <%C4m3r0n0409> Reggie played like an idiot at the end
[5:32:34] <%Grayhammatter> nice job minh
[5:32:35] <%jiggy_snipe> @Camail nope, that's why the king liked him. He needed to take towns while they were in heck messing around
[5:32:42] <%SomersaultJustice> so what's the final number for the pools?
[5:32:42] <rubbishbinge> Reggie could've won if he took towns to boost his castle value
[5:32:43] <%TheBenson8r> Anyone could have won, because video games
[5:32:43] <%Amaideus> Any one of them could've won
[5:32:45] <gastherobots> Not saying Minh cheated or anything stupid like that, just saying Minh was the best at the game.
[5:32:45] <huskarl_zap> The Dark Mihnillium has begun.
[5:32:46] <+pectusumbra> a second round of this would be very different, but let's be real, NEVER happening
[5:32:46] <+DesertPenguin> JUst imagine how Minh would be acting if he lost.
[5:32:48] <Jrocy247> Reggie screwed around too much, so he had no chance.
[5:32:49] <%NormalGuy> In the anime it's revealed that Rico is Woolie's brother and he gets stabbed in the shock of that realization
[5:32:50] <Mr__Jebus> I was rooting for reggie but i think minh absolutely played the smartest
[5:32:51] <Ritei> reggie played badly for the entire game
[5:32:57] <ExileNineteen> it's very easy for chat to play for any one of them. we have both no emotional investment and 20/20 hindsight
[5:32:57] <%spiritofmojave> @exilenineteen well, at the end there apparently oncr Minh won, he automatically grabbed all of Reggie's towns.
[5:32:58] <+hawk_rush> @NormalGuy LUL
[5:32:58] <%tearknack> @Struggleful yeah minh didn't play amazing consistently, but his strategy over time, and in the last moments, won him the game
[5:32:59] <morningmoondude> Mihn simply outplayed everyone at every step. He mihnimized the bullshit.
[5:32:59] <$Invlux> cheer500 Congrats guys on a great game, here's some consolation money for the Peace Pool if it's still open. Can't wait for Dokapon Kingdom - 2nd Gig! Now hug it out, GG
[5:32:59] <Ritei> and somehow still wasnt last place
[5:33:00] <%soFISHticated98> Minh has never insulted them
[5:33:01] <%C4m3r0n0409> I wish Woolie waited until he got in the loop to use magic medicine
[5:33:02] <Valdorick> Woolie shoulda just soul fired then countered.
[5:33:03] <JeoDood> REGGIE WAS FILLER
[5:33:04] <%Amaideus> "I've come to make an announcement"
[5:33:06] <+Dimfish> reggie played smart towards the end but it fucked him over
[5:33:07] <Fanciful_Unicorn> charity
[5:33:08] <%Amaideus> HE'S SPREADING IT
[5:33:08] <%kyh9> He's gonna split it

[5:40:34] <huskarl_zap> Lol
[5:40:34] <glass_marcus> honestly that rico block was unfortunate
[5:40:38] <%kapcommunist> about 6 million behind?
[5:40:39] <+DesertPenguin> Monday podcast is gonna be weird
[5:40:40] <XrosHawk> So when is Dokapon 2nd Gig?
[5:40:40] <%nintega010> Season 2 would be awhile. Maybe they could add punch mom for season 2 @WoolieVersus
[5:40:44] <bashful_bard> Well Reggie fucking up that darkling play was the funniest thing ever so this session was great despite my salt
[5:40:44] <%C4m3r0n0409> Fuck friendship sadface

[5:41:02] <+InfiniteHav0k> Reggie might have been better off going to the Casino
[5:41:02] <%ekodrop> @RocketBarrel it doesn't matter, they combined it
[5:41:02] <+Mr_Brocktoon_Belvedere> Produced by Hideki Kamiya
[5:41:02] <%Mrthefro> Reggie was certainly a player in the game
[5:41:04] <ExileNineteen> the ice continent was 4 towns out of like 20
[5:41:05] <%gatorafan> Kinda hard to think Salt Party involved OTHER GAMES besides Dokapon....
[5:41:07] <+Mekhet09> Reggie could have just won if he just started earlier.

[5:43:13] <%heroversusofficial> Cheer500 For the last time, here's to some good ass Dokapon. To the Dark Hero Reggie whose lust for adventure was matched only by his love of wandering. To the Gutsy Lost Soldier Woolie, who clawed his way through hell and levied the blow which allowed the demon lord to fall. To the villain Minh, whose mind and luck let him land the final blow on the demon. Not all will understand, but all who bore witness know that there will never be another adventure... until the next time, that is.
[5:43:15] <rubbishbinge> Needed to boost his castles to max value
[5:43:19] <+dmtjinni> 27

[6:02:56] <zocano> Ya screwed by rolls
[6:02:57] <Jrocy247> We know, The doubt was correct
[6:03:00] <thesickestzak> Greedy Reggie lol
[6:03:02] <mield916> do fortune street next
[6:03:11] <lotharrio> Reggie getting trapped underwater for like.. 5 turns was rough.
[6:03:11] <Xeno351> except when he bumbled the behelit
[6:03:11] <armchairmaster_> So in this part, Woolie threw away the Pat sword and opened the 8th Gate to help seal away a demon.
[6:03:12] <zocano> Honestly the rolls screwed you but you coulda got real close
[6:03:13] <%pietrowaffleton> FORTUNE STREET IS GREAT

[6:03:37] <rubbishbinge> I can't believe WoolieVS is a sugoroku channel now
[6:03:37] <%Amaideus> But in the end, he bumblefucked himself out of victory yet again
[6:03:40] <bashful_bard> The legendary plan
[6:03:48] <Jrocy247> If Reggie didn't go after Wallace, his plan would've worked
[6:04:04] <rubbishbinge> Not a guaranteed win though
[6:04:06] <thesickestzak> Reggie's biggest enemy always and forever is Reggie
[6:04:06] <%jiggy_snipe> if the rolls weren't bad
[6:04:13] <%jiggy_snipe> and you cleared SA faster maybe
[6:04:16] <+pectusumbra> wallace put him in first though. It was a good choice.
[6:04:19] <gastherobots> If this causes a Dokapon sequel/remaster like Metal Wolf XD I'll lose my shit.
[6:04:23] <+pectusumbra> it was really close

[6:06:33] <%GenesisKnight> Learn what the fuck a simp is
[6:06:45] <%tearknack> simp doesn't mean anything
[6:06:46] <ExileNineteen> it's a stupid word anyway
[6:06:54] <%tearknack> its about as meaningless as cuck at this point
[6:06:54] <%jiggy_snipe> simp is so overused now
[6:07:03] <%jiggy_snipe> people don't even know how to use it properly
[6:07:07] <%darthvaderwasasimp> The fact that you're getting upset about it is reason enough for the name honestly
[6:07:09] <%Fujiwara_92> simp became a buzz word y'all mad on nothing LUL
[6:07:10] <MaverickJoker> Doesn't change the meaning of it, no matter how much distilled the water is
[6:07:19] <%tearknack> it kind of does
[6:07:23] <MaverickJoker> the N word used to mean nothing
[6:07:26] <MaverickJoker> remember that?
[6:07:26] <arkv01> please now is not the time to discuss semantics, now is a time for celebration
[6:07:29] <%Amaideus> What kind of dumbfuck idiocy is that
[6:07:30] <%pietrowaffleton> it comes from simpleton
[6:07:33] <+prime_name> Would it be too fair for the game to let you use an item after you roll to move?
[6:07:38] <MaverickJoker> remember when the N word meant nothing?
[6:07:43] <%Amaideus> Simp doesn't come from simpleton, ffs
[6:07:43] <zocano> If Woolie's rolls woulda gone his way it probably woulda been Woolie instaed
[6:07:43] <dickbuttwoman> If he waited 1 more turn to pop medi, he would have won

[6:08:12] <thewrathofscience> "Simp" getting popular is the worst thing to happen to the term
[6:08:16] <Jrocy247> That's what happens when people a abuse a word. It loses all meaning and people just throwing it around for wrong reasons
[6:08:16] <%C4m3r0n0409> Woolie using MM made me upset

[6:15:32] <rubbishbinge> I can't believe Reggie is Agrias
[6:15:39] <arkv01> wait did delita do good after? didn't he domestically abuse the princess later?
[6:15:39] <huskarl_zap> Total War: Dokapon Kingdom TM
[6:15:41] <+pectusumbra> Woolie, make sure you bring up Delita Minh on the podcast monday
[6:15:42] <%heroversusofficial> :P
[6:15:43] <%SomersaultJustice> is Reggie Orlandeau?
[6:15:45] <%Andrizzleton> who won?
[6:15:46] <arkv01> oh yeah he killed her nvm
[6:15:53] <lotharrio> Legit though, if Reggie had taken the towns and won the "political" victory, he'd have been even more on point as Delita, since that's basically what Delita does while Ramza saves the world.

[6:20:03] <%jiggy_snipe> turns out it's probably the most popular stream
[6:20:04] <@Solidus_113> You said the cut episode sucked, because the mode you picked

[6:20:15] <%primax104> the supercut of this LP will be amazing
[6:20:16] <%Fujiwara_92> DAMN WOOLIE SAID HE HATES IT Kappa
[6:20:22] <thesickestzak> You mean pat? Kappa
[6:20:26] <%eyezehuhh> it's definitely a playlist I'll have on in the background
[6:20:27] <%DappercatEsquire> In the end you got a cool 2k each
[6:20:28] <AlfredoCavatelli> why does woolie hate video games?
[6:20:33] <%tearknack> @WoolieVersus why did you say that Dokapon is terrible and the game should have never been made Kappa
[6:20:36] <Xeno351> I can't belive pat said he hates dokapon
[6:20:40] <%DatAsuna> This definitely hits harder live as well
[6:20:45] <+pectusumbra> que "I can't believe woolie shit-talk dokapon around mouthfuls of raw meat"
[6:20:48] <%allups> bro, I might've have dropped but the blood pool helped a lot tbh

[6:20:54] <Rhinoprotoss> I'm unsubscribing from AngriestPat
[6:20:56] <gastherobots> Random thought but since I've been reading it, I would kill for a stylized history the Dokapon LP in the style of Le Morte d'Arthur... honestly I might write to pass the time.
[6:20:57] <%MichaelDood> doodBait
[6:21:00] <$QueequegTheater> "It sucked" he just said it
[6:21:03] <%SomersaultJustice> oh woolie, that's gonna happen no matter what you say Kappa
[6:21:03] <%DatAsuna> Woolie says words suck confirmed
[6:21:10] <+prime_name> Clip him saying it sucked
[6:21:11] <%krispen_wa> I can't believe Woolie stole that Dokapon while killing that guy over pie
[6:21:13] <%Diana869> the view count is still very high (especially compared too death stranding)

[6:22:11] <gbrincks> Dokapon teaches atheism like Doom does satanism
[6:22:12] <gastherobots> @tearknack Le Morte D'Woolie for the canon ending of him dying when the castle collapses
[6:22:15] <%C4m3r0n0409> Doesn't matter who won they split the money
[6:22:15] <%crossing_mao> So who Is gonna make the best moments compilation?
[6:22:16] <Rangenade> Dokapon is basically life's choas condensed into a 100hr party rpg game
[6:22:16] <ExileNineteen> dude, if the guy from the youtube comments on one of the vids that wrote the infinite squall works
[6:22:17] <%Amaideus> Life is transient eh

[6:22:38] <%Diana869> the 90% doge was still hype for me
[6:22:38] <glass_marcus> Minh stealing the passports was the sickest play handsdown
[6:22:42] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> JA RULE
[6:22:45] <%soFISHticated98> but nobody was asking what Reggie was going to do
[6:22:46] <%Diana869> dodge*
[6:22:49] <@akuda_bar> oh god I was there for that
[6:22:50] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> REMEMBER JA RULEJA RUL
[6:22:54] <%djazo> THE HERO.S SHIELD WAS THE BEST
[6:22:55] <@akuda_bar> when they were singing Battle for Everyone's Souls
[6:22:56] <@Solidus_113> Kamina
[6:23:01] <%SomersaultJustice> luda put in work
[6:23:04] <+Dimfish> my favorite was darkling reggie on danue with the come here give up meta
[6:23:05] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Remember the heroes of Indigo Plateau
[6:23:07] <%jiggy_snipe> the 91% dodge was when I knew Reggie was a shonen protag
[6:23:11] <%Amaideus> I enjoyed Reggie's godly 91% dodge
[6:23:13] <%Amaideus> YEYEYE
[6:23:17] <%Amaideus> You get it!
[6:23:27] <coldfire0007> Nuzlocke was so good
[6:23:27] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[6:23:32] <glass_marcus> That was just Gyrp Zepelli using ball breaker
[6:23:32] <JeoDood> wat if woolie keeps the gun and got the double shot on the boss
[6:23:32] <thesickestzak> Those wieners in the YouTube comments complaining about Minh "cheating" are going to be so salty 4Head
[6:23:39] <%Amaideus> That entire sequence of events for Reggie to get in there was AMAZING
[6:23:44] <JeoDood> final boss
[6:23:58] <rubbishbinge> What was Minh's weapon at the end?
[6:24:03] <%DatAsuna> That would have been a hard throw yeah
[6:24:04] <%C4m3r0n0409> Woolie mightve won with gun
[6:24:05] <%Amaideus> Lich staff I think
[6:24:06] <ExileNineteen> minh had his underworld staff still
[6:24:07] <%soFISHticated98> the Lich's staff
[6:24:08] <%Amaideus> Something like that
[6:24:09] <%soFISHticated98> don't remember the name
[6:24:14] <TigerClaws12> LUL
[6:24:17] <%krispen_wa> Woolie getting the Dokapon Sword and the Hero Shield and the Night Guy powerup only to fail was the most poetic thing ever

[6:24:20] <%soFISHticated98> yeah underworld staff
[6:24:20] <%Amaideus> OH

[6:24:23] <%Jpshum> LUL
[6:24:24] <%Amaideus> The wabbit counter then
[6:24:27] <%jiggy_snipe> yea that changed everything
[6:24:27] <ExileNineteen> and he failed by ONE TURN
[6:24:28] <JeoDood> Woolie mightve won with gun
[6:24:30] <rubbishbinge> Good shit
[6:24:40] <Oxybe> Minh's weapon was guile
[6:24:40] <%optimasmaximas> wallace being so strong still befuddles me
[6:24:42] <ExileNineteen> like, yeah, there were lots of good moments but nothing beats the last hour or so
[6:24:43] <rilou501> Hydro cannon was hype as shit. RIP Luda
[6:24:45] <%C4m3r0n0409> Reggie luck was crazy
[6:24:48] <%DatAsuna> I like reggie robbing the shop to get the exact same shield he already had
[6:24:56] <DiscoDur0> That dodge was insane!
[6:24:56] <@akuda_bar> it was super funny with everyone spamming 1
[6:24:57] <%C4m3r0n0409> 91% lol
[6:25:04] <%crimsonsaens> Minh's staff was called the Underworld Staff

[6:48:52] <+itsOnyxLeo> Wait there's a CSB one too?
[6:49:13] <+itsOnyxLeo> I'm subbed to CSB already, I guess I just never connected my discord to twitch

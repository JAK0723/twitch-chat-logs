[0:02:18] <NoireRequiem> just got home in time

[0:02:37] <%LiquidDinosaur> What is the prestige version of A sentinel do again? I always went Sentinel —-> master
[0:02:47] <+Graem> @kylejefferies yeah they got farther in the game on twitch than the YouTube buts

[0:02:56] <TDAWS_MP132> there will be some spoilers
[0:03:02] <%alrobot2014> @holistically if you missed last session it should be here in vod form, we're still on telos, but about to head to the surface
[0:03:03] <kylejefferies> gotcha.
[0:03:07] <%LiquidDinosaur> Kyle: oh boy you have some amazing shit coming
[0:03:07] <StarlitStunner> doodMako doodMako doodMako
[0:03:19] <+Dustwalker44> Star Wars HYPE!!! protonGood protonGood protonYes
[0:03:25] <kylejefferies> there won't be any Kotor 2 spoilers, I have played and beat this game on Xbox og like 20 times.
[0:03:31] <+Graem> Wedding March hype?
[0:03:37] <kylejefferies> just LP spoilers.
[0:03:45] <TDAWS_MP132> in that case, you're probably ok
[0:03:56] <1matheuw> does that means woolie and V are getting married?
[0:04:02] <fist_wizard_jay> Yooooo
[0:04:02] <TDAWS_MP132> you'll still want to watch the new youtube parts as they come out though
[0:04:02] <%LiquidDinosaur> Yeah watch the vods
[0:04:04] <Gamerprince333> i wont spoil im here for the fun
[0:04:07] <kylejefferies> unless they do some skips, there is a lot of Peragus left after part 2
[0:04:12] <Eger007> Yo you seen project gg?
[0:04:12] <+Graem> You missed some good bits in the dynamic though so you should probably watch those first
[0:04:19] <royb2> Oh shit we're back!
[0:04:22] <royb2> Light side run btw
[0:04:22] <+Graem> Like comedic bits
[0:04:25] <%krispen_wa> It's Space Cryme Time Bois
[0:04:29] <+Graem> "Light side run"
[0:04:29] <%LiquidDinosaur> @tdaws_mp132 if I watched it all on VOD should I bother watching it on YouTube?
[0:04:30] <%TRILLTURBAN> woolieSCARED_SG
[0:04:37] <%LiquidDinosaur> Nothing’s added right?
[0:04:40] <fist_wizard_jay> Been loving every fucking one of these streams
[0:04:43] <TDAWS_MP132> nothing added, yeah
[0:04:47] <kylejefferies> @liquiddinosaur Nothing added.
[0:04:51] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @TheSaltminer
[0:04:52] <MrBorisMakarov> SourPls
[0:04:57] <royb2> I loved the first LP and this is super good as well
[0:04:57] <kylejefferies> actually less content on YouTube.
[0:05:02] <Safarihat> ooh crypt song
[0:05:02] <fist_wizard_jay> Fann Y’Pak is marrying the Greater Goods
[0:05:05] <kylejefferies> the breaks are edited out iitc
[0:05:06] <@Commando_Joe> Moobot you fucking cuck
[0:05:08] <@Commando_Joe> octoGun
[0:05:10] <%LiquidDinosaur> God I’m waiting for YouTube to catch up for the fan art
[0:05:12] <+Graem> Wrong stream for debbil games talk
[0:05:14] <%TRILLTURBAN> Because I know everyone's gonna ask, yes he is using the Restored Content mod, but not M4-78
[0:05:18] <%LiquidDinosaur> I want to see art of Twerka Industries
[0:05:24] <+Fantion> love y'all
[0:05:30] <%krispen_wa> M4-78 is ass anyways
[0:05:40] <Safarihat> love this song
[0:05:44] <+Graem> Not using the droid planet mod because it's a sloggy ass
[0:05:45] <%alrobot2014> @TRILLTURBAN we've got a moobot command for it that activates ever so often
[0:05:48] <fist_wizard_jay> We do need art of Twerka Industries working for the Greater Goods
[0:05:49] <kylejefferies> @trillturban M4 the unfinished planet that modders are trying to complete themselves?
[0:05:58] <@Commando_Joe> Devil Talk is fine, just devil YELL is not
[0:05:59] <kylejefferies> or is it the purely fan made planet?
[0:06:06] <%LiquidDinosaur> While the game got rushed and things got cut for time IIRC the droid planet was MEANT to be fut
[0:06:19] <+Graem> Greater Good(s) and/or Services!
[0:06:25] <royb2> Later!
[0:06:25] <muzaki_lopez> there we go, now my name is accurate
[0:06:35] <%alrobot2014> m4-78 was cut for the greater goods
[0:06:37] <%LiquidDinosaur> Cut*. Like in a perfect world where kotor 2 had all the time and money it needed they’d have still not had it
[0:06:39] <%bumpynavel> yeyeye time for those light side later points.
[0:06:48] <royb2> For the greater good (that comes later in unspecified time)
[0:06:59] <%GraceTBM> cuts happen both due to time constraints and direction reasons
[0:07:06] <@Commando_Joe> Would Woolie be considered a Blacklight Jedi? cocola1Hmm
[0:07:07] <+i_zombee> get it
[0:07:19] <YakumoYomi> Is this one of them "devil games" I've heard about?
[0:07:26] <+Graem> No this one is safe
[0:07:32] <%GraceTBM> no he already finished doom
[0:07:44] <+Graem> It's the one with the green guy and the guns that you gotta watch out for
[0:07:44] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1229464161366794241?s=19
[0:07:45] <fist_wizard_jay> Twerka Industries begs to differ
[0:07:53] <%LiquidDinosaur> You know Anakin did a light side later move killing those kids. The clones would have shot them in a few minutes, and they’d shoot them with blasters. At least they died In an elegant and civilized way
[0:07:53] <TheBadIdeaMan> WHAAAAALES
[0:07:54] <@Squdnate> Money motherfucker
[0:07:59] <Scrub_Seeker> theme song of twerka

[0:09:00] <+Razputin217> Temmie wan monies muthafukr
[0:09:03] <+Graem> Hi Dalaig
[0:09:06] <%LiquidDinosaur> This was my morning alarm for a while. Now it’s either Taurus Demon or Rundown, the piano thing R. Dorothy bangs out when Roger sleeps in in Big O
[0:09:08] <fist_wizard_jay> Nooo
[0:09:09] <Eger007> Just a reminder Platinum just released trailer for their new game
[0:09:18] <fist_wizard_jay> He was loving Doom all the way to the end
[0:09:18] <lotharrio> If Knuckles doesn't chuckle, then why is it the second thing he ever did in a Sonic game?
[0:09:20] <NoireRequiem> GET CREDITS
[0:09:23] <%GraceTBM> Doom has such good progression that I'm sure Woolz had a great time tthe whole way through
[0:09:28] <%JuliusGemstone> ye. ye. uh. get money. ye. ye.

[0:10:15] <%GraceTBM> which song is this i almost remember it
[0:10:18] <%LiquidDinosaur> Does Woolie have enough dosh for Jal Shey Mentor armor yet? If he gets that he’s basically done with armor for the game
[0:10:19] <availablethor> Will we finish this planet today chat?
[0:10:22] <muzaki_lopez> Twerka Corporation is accepting wealthy investors now. Please see the dancing green ho for more information
[0:10:29] <fist_wizard_jay> Fann Y’Pak saves the galaxy one credit at a time
[0:10:33] <NoireRequiem> reminds me of kavinsky
[0:10:35] <%krispen_wa> telos is pretty damn long
[0:10:47] <%alrobot2014> @LiquidDinosaur nah i think he's about halfway there in terms of money
[0:10:56] <Nested_Dreams> YEYEYE
[0:10:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> How do we throw Bits at the green ho?
[0:11:05] <%TRILLTURBAN> Telos IS really long
[0:11:06] <%krispen_wa> Jal shey looks like ass tho
[0:11:07] <fist_wizard_jay> In the slot
[0:11:14] <Maleicus> i think he'll finish telos today
[0:11:21] <%alpacasintophats> woolieYE
[0:11:24] <BallerSwagBro9k> Is that Woolies ACTUAL Apex Config?
[0:11:30] <fist_wizard_jay> Slide your bits into the slot or use a card
[0:11:30] <%TRILLTURBAN> Does anyone know what planet he's doing after Telos?
[0:11:35] <%alrobot2014> oh yeah the rest of telos from where he is now is pretty straightforward
[0:11:37] <Maleicus> at least should but he could take it slower
[0:11:40] <Mrbaconator> what is this song
[0:11:41] <TDAWS_MP132> I don't think woolie knows
[0:11:42] <%MichaelDood> woolieOMG
[0:11:47] <%krispen_wa> I'm assuming Nar Shaddaa
[0:11:52] <TDAWS_MP132> But i'm sure V will have some recomendations
[0:11:54] <%GraceTBM> something beneath from pinout
[0:11:54] <%GeneralSCPatton> Only V knows
[0:11:56] <%krispen_wa> that's usually almost always first
[0:11:57] <sonofthedeepsouth> Soooo turn around and feel the wind blow
[0:11:57] <%LiquidDinosaur> Aand just like that my fucking lunch ends. See you in the VOD, peace
[0:12:03] <%Superspider51> Nar Shadda for the best dark side prompts
[0:12:06] <TDAWS_MP132> I always do either Nar Shaddaa or Dantoine
[0:12:12] <%alrobot2014> cya dinosaur
[0:12:18] <sonofthedeepsouth> As the city glitters in gold ffar below
[0:12:22] <am_omega> Yo time to lab some Season 3 of DBFZ while I listen to the Hustle of Fann Y'Pak
[0:12:30] <%derap41> Just what I need while doing 500 jumps in Elite Dangerous
[0:12:31] <%LiquidDinosaur> @superspider51 I think V already said he’s going to tell Woolie to make the trandoshian jump
[0:12:33] <+Mindtrick_Matt> Yo what song is this chat?
[0:12:50] <%krispen_wa> what's the trandoshin jump?
[0:12:50] <indig0bird> Dantooine is useful to get The Crystal but Nar Shaddaa gets you more companions early
[0:12:58] <Zebroneath> Last time on KOTOR2, Woolie boosted the economy of Telos. LUL
[0:12:59] <TDAWS_MP132> 100%
[0:13:00] <%GraceTBM> something beneath from pinout
[0:14:02] <%GraceTBM> the final battle in dantooine with the mercs is a little tougher at low level as well
[0:14:05] <sonofthedeepsouth> How did Woolie got lil V to play with him, through Jihad of course.
[0:14:12] <%TRILLTURBAN> So what's y'alls fav planet? I like Dxun/Onderon
[0:14:21] <%GraceTBM> though to be fair, the final sequence in Nar Shad can be pretty tough too
[0:14:31] <TomFrank> PogChamp
[0:14:33] <%krispen_wa> Korriban has that really rad tomb section
[0:14:34] <%GraceTBM> Dxun/Onderon probably felt the most unique to me personally
[0:14:35] <sonofthedeepsouth> Cursed Akatisuki Woolie
[0:14:36] <BallerSwagBro9k> yeyeyeyeyeye
[0:14:37] <TDAWS_MP132> the nar shad sequence is rough
[0:14:38] <%TRILLTURBAN> woolieSCARED_SG woolieSCARED_SG woolieSCARED_SG :(

[0:34:39] <indig0bird> You have to corrupt a normal kyber crystal
[0:34:40] <+fandomgod> Make the crystal bleed

[0:34:44] <+captain_history> crystal bleeding yeah
[0:34:45] <%DatAsuna> That's canon only
[0:34:49] <Enemy_In_Disguise> That’s dumb
[0:34:52] <notenoughgirls> they call it "bleeding" the crystal
[0:34:55] <+heartbbyy> time is convoluted in Star Wars
[0:35:00] <StarlitStunner> Used to be just synthetic cooked crystals
[0:35:01] <%gatorafan> Star Wars is Fantasy... Star Online Kappa

[0:35:16] <dereks0n> Crystal bleeding is a pretty sick name honestly
[0:35:17] <indig0bird> Yeah,both are fine
[0:35:19] <availablethor> Nier Automata does it even better because their technology is actually based on actual magic from the drakengard universe.

[0:40:37] <%RioGascar> even down to sith lord getting fk’d by his apprentice
[0:40:39] <Djinnazz> @RioGascar This is STAR WARS original story
[0:40:44] <+Graem> Gonna be brutally honest? Galactic Civil War my favourite era. Design, style, etc.
[0:40:47] <+kyh9> Featuring Ludacris?
[0:40:47] <+talon84> I love these videos
[0:40:57] <+kyh9> flat helmets are goat
[0:40:59] <%RioGascar> @djinnazz “”original””
[0:41:00] <+tearknack> @RioGascar no. this is the plot of arc 1 of Tales of the Jedi, the comics released in the 90s that KotoR is a sequel/spinoff of
[0:41:02] <lotharrio> Assyrian hats?
[0:41:03] <+TheDankDemon> sith are big cowards
[0:41:03] <@Squdnate> @RioGascar No this is history of the Sith and the Hyperspace War
[0:41:05] <+Hunterv96> would you rather it be pointy?
[0:41:06] <KeiPrime> marka ragnos and korriban was gettin big push at this point, showin up in kotor and jedi academy

[0:41:33] <+kyh9> Roman Republic
[0:41:36] <SeruraRenge> So officially, no one but the Sith knew where Dromund Kaas was because dark side energies hides it, right?
[0:41:38] <CureMode666> Space roman
[0:41:42] <+MaSterChiEfin420blntNinjA> Exar Kun Kreygasm

[0:41:51] <Enemy_In_Disguise> EXAR
[0:41:52] <lotharrio> Exar Kun-kun
[0:41:53] <Tucker0603> this dude was dope in the comics
[0:41:54] <+Graem> I don't like the ancient Sith much. Too pointy and obviously evil. I prefer it when they pretend to be galactic police types
[0:41:55] <+RedKnightVI> Uwu Exar-kun?
[0:41:59] <Daxalog> "Give me your phone"
[0:42:00] <muzaki_lopez> i still need to read exar kun's book

[0:42:40] <+Graem> Exar Kun is the only ancient sith I ever learned the name of
[0:42:41] <%gatorafan> Moshi Moshi, exar-kun desu
[0:42:43] <lotharrio> Exar Kun, stay out of the fanfic suggestions in the wiki!
[0:42:45] <dereks0n> Played a Star Wars tabletop once where we killed a reincarnation of Exar Kun so he’s pretty hype
[0:42:45] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Exar Kun is Anakin BUT GOOD
[0:42:51] <Redblood801> The battle of Mustafar should have had powerpoints
[0:42:51] <KyberMies> sorry if this has been asked before but did Woolie hear about platinums new game?
[0:42:51] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:42:52] <KeiPrime> the LiViNg FoRCe
[0:42:57] <SeruraRenge> See Exar Kun is ruined for me because my first exposure to him was his ghost in KJA's Jedi Academy Trilogy where he corrupted Kyp Durron.
[0:42:58] <ALTRNico> it's force Woolie
[0:42:58] <+Shikari21> can someone link me these vids they are watching?
[0:42:59] <lotharrio> Well they were Force ghosts inside phylacteries, I thought?
[0:43:00] <%fallenangelzelos> Woolie you saw a sith ghost in KOTOR 1
[0:43:00] <+Mindtrick_Matt> Sith ghost haunt shit tho
[0:43:01] <Tucker0603> there are SOOOO many sith force ghosts
[0:43:07] <+Graem> Purple force ghosts tho
[0:43:07] <+BlockingDisabled> You saw one in KotOR 1!
[0:43:11] <+SinisterBroccoli> I really like Dark jedi with a blue saber
[0:43:12] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Sith could totally be ghosts
[0:43:14] <notenoughgirls> george wanted to retcon that force ghosts are a light side thing exclusively
[0:43:15] <%krispen_wa> Musashi?
[0:43:17] <+SinisterBroccoli> Like anakin at the end of ep3
[0:43:21] <+Shikari21> or give me the names too look them up

[0:43:32] <+bimblehim> ancient sith worm.
[0:43:34] <+TheDankDemon> a WORM
[0:43:40] <+SarcFa> @Shikari21 look up master gnost dural archives on youtube, you should get something roughly an hour long that has everything
[0:43:45] <dereks0n> Pretty sure Sith ghosts were way more fucked up
[0:43:48] <spirittiart> Beat the worm
[0:43:50] <sonofthedeepsouth> Sith Messiah
[0:43:53] <lotharrio> That worm killed so many sand people.
[0:43:56] <+Graem> Single handedly
[0:43:56] <+Shikari21> @sarcfa Thanks!
[0:43:58] <mexicansunglasses> What are they watching?
[0:43:58] <%jinking79> now Sith ghost live in wat ever item they had

[0:44:08] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[0:44:10] <royb2> Space persia
[0:44:10] <am_omega> Hey I would become Sith if I was about to be eaten by a fucking giant WORM.
[0:44:13] <royb2> Sparsia
[0:44:13] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THATS RAD
[0:44:21] <muzaki_lopez> fun fact, exar kun INVENTED the double bladed saber
[0:44:27] <%RioGascar> That looks more roman?
[0:44:33] <%alrobot2014> basilisk war droids are fucking rad
[0:44:41] <Maleicus> the raddest
[0:44:45] <%BallerSwagBro9k> This looks so much cooler than the current canon
[0:44:46] <Pechugaman> I tought we where playing kotor
[0:44:49] <+Graem> All these weird names coming at me so fast I can't keep up
[0:44:50] <%MrMoonGoose> What's this video?
[0:45:02] <Tucker0603> YEP HE MADE IT
[0:45:11] <Pechugaman> Why are we n the shitty mmo
[0:45:12] <SeruraRenge> So what we've learned here is that George was right about Star Wars. It rhymes
[0:45:12] <+talon84> Kun's saber predated Maul by a LOOOONG shot
[0:45:13] <spirittiart> fly with spaceships, fight with spears
[0:45:14] <ThatGuyThere03> why isn't this canon anymore?
[0:45:18] <%RioGascar> Like he still has blue color
[0:45:27] <+Affiliate_> Exar Kun?
[0:45:30] <+Affiliate_> nice
[0:45:31] <am_omega> No not Exar-Kun. He was your sempai.
[0:45:32] <muzaki_lopez> another sith ghost
[0:45:34] <%alrobot2014> @MrMoonGoose lore videos that were ads for swotor that have been edited by a fan to exclude kotor2 spoilers
[0:45:43] <SeruraRenge> it's just the same events over and over, and we mean LITERALLY the same events but with the names changes.
[0:45:44] <xXxPS9xXx> a loved one has emerged from heart surgery today. They're going to live
[0:45:46] <NoireRequiem> @ThatGuyThere03 Mostly for 'simplicity'
[0:45:47] <+bimblehim> in the sacred realm you go
[0:45:51] <%RioGascar> you didnt win
[0:45:52] <+SarcFa> because Disney is simultaneously creatively bankrupt but can't stand canon outside what they made
[0:45:55] <Tucker0603> LOL
[0:45:56] <+tearknack> yeah, the tales of the Jedi comics were in the 90s, before everything but Thrawn, pretty much
[0:45:56] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL

[0:46:02] <1matheuw> whoops almost spoilers
[0:46:09] <KyberMies> did Woolie hear about Platinum's new game?
[0:46:12] <lotharrio> Of greatest interest is SPOILERS
[0:46:13] <ThePimpGuin> I feel like we should of just saved this for after the game
[0:46:14] <Halospaz117> That was a quality edit
[0:46:14] <%JohnAtDawn> And then Luke smacked him down four thousand years latter.
[0:46:19] <@Squdnate> This REDACTED FOR KOTOR2 NEWCOMERS edition I dig
[0:46:25] <SuperChumps> @WoolieVersus what is that video from?

[0:47:11] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 47 minutes and 13 seconds
[0:47:12] <+talon84> Most of the plot from Rise of Skywalker was lifted from the Dark Empire comics
[0:47:13] <theKingRamses> middle aged yoda
[0:47:15] <ralphfromdk> Oh yeah, Lucas and Disney has not had a new idea about Star Wars since the original trilogy. It's all made by books, comics and videogames.
[0:47:15] <Tucker0603> fuck off with that shit
[0:47:17] <%RioGascar> star wars got no idea as so much is recycled at some point from some old cannon shit
[0:47:17] <+theAncopro> teen yoda

[0:47:46] <dereks0n> Plus it has space vikings
[0:47:50] <Eger007> Tulak Hord
[0:47:52] <+Graem> Star Wars canon has never been more frustrating. The lettered system was easier!
[0:47:52] <+tearknack> @BallerSwagBro9k jsut look at master gnost dural archives
[0:47:54] <ralphfromdk> Case in point, Fallen Order, boom, great game.
[0:47:55] <%JJCheeker> I just don't know if I trust the current writers
[0:47:57] <KeiPrime> phase 3: ????
[0:47:57] <+Affiliate_> @WoolieVersus You should check out The Dark Times. amazing comic series
[0:47:59] <KeiPrime> phase 4 : profit
[0:48:02] <zocano> Republic Commando is fuckin ace
[0:48:03] <SeruraRenge> now go read the Thrawn trilogy! @WoolieVersus
[0:48:05] <+Graem> Also, bullshit. Original two movies were great.
[0:48:06] <%DatAsuna> writing is hard jsut recycle old stuff but worse
[0:48:10] <+BionoidLCR> @zocano YES
[0:48:11] <spirittiart> LIT Bape Yoda
[0:48:13] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Sith wont be in it tho. Since they were exctint for 1000a of years
[0:48:19] <Dova573> inb4 Knight of the High Republic Kappa
[0:48:19] <NoireRequiem> big brap whiff
[0:48:19] <%RioGascar> wow thats a LONG CON
[0:48:20] <DocMadfox> WHICH THEY SHOULD HAVE JUST DONE WITH THE FUCKING EU! Fuck's sake
[0:48:21] <+tearknack> @BallerSwagBro9k warning, spoilers for KotoR 2, and swotor, if you care
[0:48:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @tearknack Thnaks
[0:48:24] <Dova573> gane
[0:48:28] <Dova573> game
[0:48:28] <%RioGascar> THAT CON IS SO LONG
[0:48:29] <+SarcFa> why couldn't they just adapt the old lore tho?
[0:48:34] <theKingRamses> so how about that official revan force fx saber
[0:48:34] <%RioGascar> like decades
[0:48:36] <+SarcFa> is my big question
[0:48:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @tearknack Beat em all
[0:48:40] <SeruraRenge> And it's always the exact same war
[0:48:53] <WanderingSwordsman> Fuck off, high republic is going to suck
[0:48:57] <%DatAsuna> you can always double check em later
[0:49:06] <Ifrit_13> someone need to tell woolie about Darth Vectivus
[0:49:08] <+tearknack> @BallerSwagBro9k i'm replaying kotor 2, and planning on finally checking swotor out
[0:49:10] <lotharrio> He used to wear a hat. Gotcha.
[0:49:12] <+fugatlas> welp see you next week then
[0:49:16] <Narukamiiii> I wonder if their stubbornness of not adapting stories from the old Republic is because they already have plans for that or just because their dumb
[0:49:17] <am_omega> I have no hope for the High Republic.
[0:49:20] <%DatAsuna> mostly it's just seeing rad shit like mandalore and ulic on the chain
[0:49:22] <Tucker0603> high republic can suck my dick.
[0:49:27] <Eger007> tulak hord for the win
[0:49:30] <NoireRequiem> I'm looking forward to high republic they have amazing writers on it
[0:49:32] <Psyramics> lmao, they tried that and it sucked
[0:49:37] <%DatAsuna> @tearknack hit me up if you want a guild
[0:49:40] <%RioGascar> high republic is so far away from any adaptations
[0:49:41] <%fallenangelzelos> they should have gone 200 years in the future...better yet, 1000
[0:49:44] <%krispen_wa> just make KOTOR lore canon
[0:49:50] <%JJCheeker> I would rather go 200 years into the future
[0:49:56] <%JohnAtDawn> They will not have new ideas that are good
[0:49:57] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:49:57] <%Superspider51> just say Kotor 1 and 2 is canon and do nothing else. Maybe 1 to 1 remake Kotor 1 but with Keanu Reeves voicing male Revan
[0:50:01] <%RioGascar> also star wars video games get fucked : l
[0:50:02] <xXxPS9xXx> @docmadfox They would have had to pay all those great EU writers effectively pennies on their giant skyscraper sized platinum dollar bars and we can't have that
[0:50:07] <%DatAsuna> 1000 years of nothing in legends
[0:50:12] <SeruraRenge> @krispen_wa They ALMOST did in Clone Wars but went against it at the last second. Revan was going to be in the show
[0:50:17] <Reizie_Etherealm> LUL
[0:50:19] <+tearknack> i mean there was some shit
[0:50:19] <@Squdnate> I'm always up for giving stuff a chance. But High Republic is just screaming "okay we are gonna give you 'Old Republic', but in our way" So it sounds like it's gonna be cherry picking of stuff from Old and spin it with whatever they wanna do
[0:50:20] <ALTRNico> wikitiwawa
[0:50:25] <zocano> SWTOR’s class stories are *neat* but still largely hit or miss, but the “main” Sith Emperor stories are pretty shlocky
[0:50:25] <+SinisterBroccoli> desperado
[0:50:29] <+MrSammichMan> If they just straigt adapted Revan's story into movies it'd be cool, but that'd never happen.
[0:50:34] <%DatAsuna> it goes ruusan reformation ->1000 year skip -> movies
[0:50:40] <+veget188> can we get a pat vs little v episode where little v argues with pat y star wars is good
[0:50:42] <Reizie_Etherealm> Wild rida, no you don't want nada
[0:50:45] <%krispen_wa> Agent story is the one real good part of SWTOR
[0:50:47] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Meh
[0:50:52] <Mike_Mc> blood ocean space Vikings
[0:50:55] <@Squdnate> I can't wait to read about how Yoda had a massive gambling problem before becoming a Jedi
[0:51:00] <SeruraRenge> @WoolieVersus After the Vong the only thing you can be is cautiously optimistic
[0:51:00] <Tucker0603> psaDab psaDab psaDab psaDab psaDab
[0:51:03] <%DatAsuna> inquisitor story is my fave tbh
[0:51:06] <+Graem> Too bad those writers will suck
[0:51:07] <zocano> I genuinely had a fun time with the Bounty Hunter story
[0:51:12] <sonofthedeepsouth> The ancient sith did nothing wrong
[0:51:13] <Narukamiiii> The sequel trilogy made me not want new stuff, and rather just see old stuff adapted , even if theres a chance of them fking it up
[0:51:15] <zocano> Even if it’s on the bland side

[0:52:57] <am_omega> Yeah not in china.
[0:52:59] <NoireRequiem> MIDICHORIANS
[0:53:02] <zocano> KotoR2 Sith Lords are probably the most effective “way” to be sith
[0:53:10] <sonofthedeepsouth> All I'm saying is that the Sith are naturally violent brother
[0:53:12] <%RioGascar> and thats why jj
[0:53:14] <%Grayhammatter> don't explain the magic
[0:53:15] <+tearknack> @am_omega tbf, nothing says jedi can't fuck
[0:53:16] <%RioGascar> Was the worst idea
[0:53:18] <+Graem> That's why GCW era was good.
[0:53:21] <sonofthedeepsouth> Jedi Master Wakka
[0:53:26] <%RioGascar> he is good at mystery boxs
[0:53:33] <+Graem> No Magic explained but made special
[0:53:34] <+tearknack> attachments are bad, but nobody says nothing bout sex
[0:53:35] <%RioGascar> but answers he always sucks at
[0:53:36] <dereks0n> I just figure they’re magic too
[0:53:40] <lotharrio> I'd have liked it if the super high midiclorian count was: 10.

[0:54:05] <am_omega> Listen, S cells have not even been mentioned in Super.
[0:54:05] <%TRILLTURBAN> Do the Whills control the S Cells?
[0:54:06] <+Graem> Nobody talks about s cells tho
[0:54:08] <+captain_history> to be fair S Cells aren't really touches in the series itself
[0:54:09] <sonofthedeepsouth> UBERMENCH SAYIAN
[0:54:13] <Bladeexe> They already did it with Ozaru though.
[0:54:14] <Mr_216> So Power Levels again

[0:54:22] <dustingV> ughhh, I forgot about that, why did you remind me?
[0:54:23] <%Prevot> literally the reason Gohan was super strong was because genetics
[0:54:23] <+TheDankDemon> explaining magic loses the "magic" of it
[0:54:24] <%alpacasintophats> alpacasintophats subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! first time catching one of these live! Can't wait for the GREATER GOOD to commence

[0:54:31] <ALTRNico> remember when Vegeta told Krillin to shoot him?
[0:54:32] <RyuShinden> Zenkai Boost is understandable. S Cells is bullshit

[0:54:51] <TomFrank> but the power struggles
[0:54:53] <+Graem> Power Levels themselves were bullshit, and I'm saying that as a fan of Tien and Piccolo

[0:54:56] <yeildingthought> Inferior Saiyan kids LUL
[0:54:59] <%Ashenik1> Imagine LOTR with scientific explanations....
[0:55:00] <NoireRequiem> COOL CAN BE STUPID CAN BE COOL
[0:55:02] <@Commando_Joe> S Cells was a really stupid thing Toriyama dropped in an interview and we should all pretend it never happened
[0:55:03] <Bladeexe> Its because Toriyama doesnt care.
[0:55:10] <Narukamiiii> You can twist it and say midoclorians are just things that are attracted to the force, but cells are oof

[1:02:24] <SeruraRenge> @WoolieVersus What Atton says is he was a last-second addition to Kotor 2 and was meant to be the hero of a Jedi Knight spinoff

[1:21:58] <+conqab> what were they thinking lol
[1:22:06] <Redblood801> No negatives
[1:22:07] <+tearknack> @conqab no one, droid programming just develops sentient by default
[1:22:15] <+conqab> hmmm
[1:22:22] <+tearknack> and nobody will ever "fix this" ever
[1:22:33] <+tearknack> beyond just wiping their memory every so often
[1:22:35] <zeroraider> The more steps in a plan, the more opportunity to muck it all up
[1:22:44] <%gatorafan> MrDestructoid give me a weapon, you can trust me
[1:22:45] <%RioGascar> If caught we provided you with a cyanide tablet
[1:22:48] <+conqab> ah yes that makes sense
[1:22:52] <+SarcFa> star wars droids gain more sentience ove rtime, it's why droid techs routinely wipe the droids memory
[1:22:59] <+SarcFa> so they remain compliant

[1:36:16] <manwithaxe> Bae-dur
[1:36:19] <%jepupu> Face masks aren't very jedi-like in Star Wars as far as I know
[1:36:20] <MidnightBurst12> when the sith is warning you about the dark side you have a problem
[1:36:21] <lotharrio> Bao-Dur is a punch.
[1:36:21] <zocano> Bao Dur’s VA is lovely

[1:36:53] <Samm815> The creepiest Zabrak I've ever met.
[1:37:11] <MidnightBurst12> the man with the softest voice in the galaxy
[1:37:12] <%MrMoonGoose> Bao's cool wit me. He's a ride or die
[1:37:15] <%Irridium> kinda racist there bro. "he's a zabrak he ain't patient like us"
[1:37:16] <%fallenangelzelos> prototype garus
[1:37:25] <+SolidusRex> The sexiest Zabrak I ever met
[1:37:30] <Redblood801> HEYO!

[1:37:36] <Reizie_Etherealm> LUL
[1:37:40] <Puhff> Bazinga
[1:37:43] <MidnightBurst12> boooo
[1:37:43] <xenolaliaSA> fuck he IS proto garus, isn't he
[1:37:45] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Kreia WILL axe a fool
[1:37:46] <Dangerzone979> He's got a real strong jawline. Like a Hapsburg
[1:37:48] <indig0bird> Huge spoilers, WWoolie don't look, Kreia hates him deeply because she can't read is mind but the Exile can. Then while he attributes that to his service with him she just goes full racist and says she can't read Bao-Dur's thoughts because he's an alien
[1:37:50] <Graywolf_the_45th> Grandma gonna fuck you up
[1:37:53] <Samm815> I don't think I would normally trust him. But I trust him.
[1:38:08] <+tearknack> @indig0bird okay just don't post spoilers
[1:38:16] <%fallenangelzelos> This also feels like the Asari consort in ME1
[1:38:27] <%MrMoonGoose> Kreia resorts to childish insults when she's frustrated
[1:38:28] <+tearknack> @indig0bird cause there's probably people here who haven't played kotor 2
[1:38:35] <SummonerMagno> strands even...
[1:38:37] <%derap41> hippie shit
[1:38:38] <bimblehim> chodo knows what's up
[1:38:42] <indig0bird> Sorry, it's just another point against Kreia
[1:38:43] <+theAncopro> "well actually-"
[1:38:45] <%gatorafan> S T R A N D S
[1:38:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Wut?
[1:38:49] <MidnightBurst12> it's all connected, bro
[1:38:52] <xenolaliaSA> strand game
[1:38:55] <lotharrio> Yeah! Manspalin all over her face!
[1:38:58] <siamzero94> Kreia stop being so cranky
[1:38:59] <zocano> Tbf he ain’t wrong about the life connections
[1:39:01] <indig0bird> Everything points at her being extremely protective of the Exile
[1:39:03] <+commanderclaw> KotoR 2 is the first Strand game
[1:39:03] <dukenux> Grass grows, birds fly, and brothat mushu shaka paka
[1:39:08] <zocano> There is literally a character that exploits that
[1:39:08] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Kreia “fuck this space hippie”
[1:39:15] <+tearknack> kranny is a salty bitch
[1:39:16] <theKingRamses> if it works it works
[1:39:16] <pan_nochal> Chodo is a secret dattebayo motherfuck
[1:39:27] <%MrMoonGoose> She's not perfect. She's not even as perfect as she thinks she is, but I think she's aware of it.

[1:40:01] <pan_nochal> "aannd done" "but I don't feel anything"
[1:40:01] <wotebi> ye more like super kami guru
[1:40:04] <lotharrio> Because Gohan was the only magic one.
[1:40:07] <Aydarkzero> b/c Goku wouldn't allow something like that
[1:40:09] <%TRILLTURBAN> Like part of one force ability
[1:40:12] <SeruraRenge> because Gohan was the only one who had his power hidden
[1:40:19] <@Commando_Joe> they didn't do it to everyone because Old Kai is a fuck
[1:40:21] <siamzero94> That's like 1/3 of Pockets force points
[1:40:22] <am_omega> Shame you can't be SSJ while Mystic Kappa
[1:40:26] <Valentinius_Anodyne> "My work here is done." "But you didn't do anything"

[1:46:07] <@Commando_Joe> Season 1 Ezra was shit with a light saber
[1:46:08] <T_Sasquatch> People forget OG yoda is an old weird asshole
[1:46:09] <ALTRNico> then he fought the dooku
[1:46:10] <dukenux> and then he was a jumping bean
[1:46:10] <DocMadfox> Fuck's sake, YODA USES THE FORCE TO FIGHT WITH A LIGHTSABER
[1:46:13] <lotharrio> Mace Windu is a terrible swordsman. Palpatine, too.
[1:46:15] <+Imperial_Madman> Yoda needs that cbt to feel
[1:46:24] <%RedDragonMoth> In a comic Yoda used a mind trick to not pay for his dinner at a diner
[1:46:27] <siamzero94> Nah Goblin on speed is true yoda
[1:46:27] <ThatGuyThere03> Imagine if he was just so powerful nobody could fire up a lightsaber around him
[1:46:28] <+theAncopro> he's SSS styling
[1:46:28] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:46:29] <ZeeJiggle> Only reason Yoda was so good is cause nobody could hit him with the horizontals. Wait..

[1:48:43] <%Irridium> WE ARE UNDER FUCKING ATTACK
[1:48:44] <%Grayhammatter> how did happun?
[1:48:53] <ZeeJiggle> I like how you can clearly see the background is the area we're currently in
[1:48:53] <lotharrio> The moment you stopped looking, we all started to die!
[1:49:00] <+TopTieramisu> T pose is actually an ancient lightsaber form

[1:49:44] <zeroraider> go back for loot and money
[1:49:50] <dukenux> Would that add to the dark side, or just not add to the light
[1:49:55] <star_feline> it's time for the FACE HEEL TURN
[1:50:00] <Redblood801> Ithorians go down, but Kreia go up!
[1:50:06] <%RioGascar> Wonder if you can help the people trying to kill the hippies
[1:50:11] <ThatGuyThere03> it's because it's not 100% jedi shit
[1:50:11] <%DatAsuna> No you were right the first time
[1:50:15] <%DatAsuna> It ain't just seems
[1:50:30] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> Doom cock
[1:50:31] <Paranoid_Jumbotron> grey jedis are so cool
[1:50:34] <indig0bird> Kreia chewes you out of you go Dark Side
[1:50:42] <@Commando_Joe> Lucas also killed Grey Jedi in canon
[1:50:43] <candidateplays> But those are in the trilogies, though.
[1:50:45] <%fallenangelzelos> This is why Woolie likes Legend of the Galactic Heroes
[1:50:47] <indig0bird> Because she thinks you're becoming too much of a psychopath
[1:50:53] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> We're STILL on Taris!!??

[1:51:16] <@Commando_Joe> I can't believe Robotnik murdered all those people in a G rated animated movie
[1:51:19] <+doc_ock_rokc> Kids movies are there for the ENTIRE FAMILY
[1:51:20] <lotharrio> Annakin would have been fine if they just let him openly marry his wife that everyone knew he was married to.

[1:55:53] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> Anybody read about Disney pushing for The High Republic era?
[1:55:58] <%Grayhammatter> aw, no punch wizard
[1:56:10] <+tearknack> the problem is that because the empire is a vague, generic evil
[1:56:14] <Samm815> @RioGascar it looks cool (dammit Narzis
[1:56:16] <+tearknack> they're marketable
[1:56:16] <+Deosier> Is it a possible build to be a punch wizard

[1:56:39] <+doc_ock_rokc> @Rich_In_Antioxidants Yeah, Hopefully we can replace the team of that soon because the writers are all individuals that haven't had a SINGLE success under their belt
[1:56:47] <+TopTieramisu> does star wars have any kind of lightsaber brass knuckles?
[1:56:51] <lotharrio> @Deosier Yeah in 2. I think... you want to be a male PC for reasons, though.
[1:56:51] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> I usually play punch wizard until I get a lightsaber

[2:12:31] <Tucker0603> zabrak are fucking rad
[2:12:32] <%DatAsuna> The split is a canon only thing V
[2:12:39] <%DatAsuna> They're not split in legends
[2:12:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> The black part is a tatto
[2:12:40] <Halospaz117> Maul is Dathomiri, this guy is Irodonian
[2:12:41] <+Mindtrick_Matt> Darth Maul has Sith tattoos
[2:12:42] <ralphfromdk> Just like human, some zabrak are grey, some are red. It's all just colours.
[2:12:42] <T_Sasquatch> Savage Opressssssss
[2:12:46] <+Graem> The blood boils and mixes with the skin I guess
[2:12:47] <%derap41> The Dark ones are evil Woolie
[2:12:50] <Dangerzone979> Tattooed usually
[2:12:54] <powerprotoman> actual race wars because of the force
[2:12:58] <%Superspider51> it's actual tattoos given at birth
[2:13:00] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @derap41 cmonBruh
[2:13:06] <Samm815> I prefer Maul has tattoos.
[2:13:09] <%DatAsuna> @Halospaz117 maul's a zabrak in legends, dathomir in canon
[2:13:11] <+tearknack> yeah, as DatAsuna said, in old canon, its just tattooes
[2:13:12] <%derap41> @BallerSwagBro9k Hey I didn't make the game
[2:13:12] <siamzero94> All Zabrak sith have tattoos
[2:13:13] <+ejn127> friend LUL
[2:13:14] <ALTRNico> The tatted ones are in Dathomir right?
[2:13:14] <Enemy_In_Disguise> The BLACK Zabrak Kappa
[2:13:16] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> maui has tattoos
[2:13:23] <leonsnixon> Friend...
[2:13:29] <%Superspider51> @DatAsuna Dathomir is a planet, home of the Zabraks
[2:13:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @derap41 I know it all good LUL
[2:13:34] <SeruraRenge> I'm gonna be honest, Bao-Dur is the least interesting character in the game to me.
[2:13:37] <Halospaz117> @DatAsuna Is that not still just Zabrak from another planet? Not to familiar with canon
[2:13:37] <notenoughgirls> i think maul canonically has tattoos
[2:13:43] <+tearknack> @Superspider51 big retcons
[2:13:48] <+Graem> Oh god they're uglier with the lines
[2:13:50] <%DatAsuna> @Superspider51 It's a planet yes, it's not a zabrak world in legends tho
[2:13:51] <Dangerzone979> Also tattoos, they were a big deal in some Sith circles
[2:13:53] <+Graem> instead of the streaks
[2:13:55] <$SirGO0SE> hes so cool
[2:13:56] <%DatAsuna> The retcon was dumb
[2:13:58] <HyperBomb21> I could fall asleep listening to Bao-Dur's voice
[2:14:01] <+SarcFa> fuck clone wars dathomir bullshit, the ventress and maul retcons were oof
[2:14:01] <Deadbulky> Bao dur is the most tired of all characters
[2:14:04] <+Graem> He looks like he has a synthetic face
[2:14:10] <%DatAsuna> It's the same as how Ventress used to be a rattataki
[2:14:13] <%BallerSwagBro9k> R.O.B?
[2:14:19] <+RealThiele> R O B A L L
[2:14:25] <mexicansunglasses> This guy did ASMR in Star Wars universe
[2:14:25] <Samm815> @DatAsuna what is she now?
[2:14:26] <mihokspawn> If you push Bao to the DS his patterns turn black
[2:14:26] <Halospaz117> HIS VOICE IS SO COOL
[2:14:27] <MrBorisMakarov> yeyeye
[2:14:28] <%DatAsuna> Until legends decided datjomiran women look exactly like rattataki
[2:14:29] <brookstar> those lines are burnt in with acid right?
[2:14:29] <dereks0n> SPEAK UP
[2:14:32] <+rareqq> BOY is he interesting
[2:14:33] <indig0bird> Bao-Dur is best boy
[2:14:35] <$SirGO0SE> MORE tired characters please
[2:14:35] <Heyestus> Ambient sounds 3x louder than speech

[2:14:40] <indig0bird> If a little... off
[2:14:40] <lotharrio> He's the most relaxed man in the entire setting.
[2:14:42] <Iwashi94> wow I totally forgot about his voice
[2:14:43] <Samm815> @DatAsuna that's stupid
[2:14:48] <leonsnixon> The WAR
[2:14:48] <jorniev> THE MALACHOR 5
[2:14:50] <Madbearv> he's broken as a person
[2:14:51] <%DatAsuna> @Samm815 Bald species of gray people with tatts, TCW retconned her to be a different species
[2:15:02] <%DatAsuna> The TV show retconned a lot of shit
[2:15:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> The droids forget themselves right into oblivion
[2:15:07] <Samm815> @DatAsuna so exactly the same?
[2:15:10] <+Graem> I can't get over his energy limb
[2:15:20] <mihokspawn> @Madbearv who isn't in this game?
[2:15:21] <$SirGO0SE> it rules
[2:15:25] <Ding0_Starr> love the game but i can't stand the beginning section. Just give the ship already!!
[2:15:29] <+SarcFa> the show retconned a lot of shit it didn't even NEED to retcon for it to work
[2:15:35] <%DatAsuna> @Samm815 No because now they said they're from the same place as maul
[2:15:39] <Dangerzone979> @DatAsuna A zabrak sub-species unique to Dathomir
[2:15:42] <Deadbulky> LUL
[2:15:43] <brookstar> you can make this dude learn the force ae?
[2:15:43] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL

[2:15:54] <star_feline> sassy grsanny is the best
[2:15:58] <Samm815> @Dakuu75 she's a Jedi.

[2:16:19] <%DatAsuna> Legends comes first, to legends stories
[2:16:24] <@Commando_Joe> Wookie Slavers CZERKA?
[2:16:24] <%DatAsuna> Canon comes first, to canon stories
[2:16:25] <@Commando_Joe> NOOOOOOOO
[2:16:27] <+tearknack> @Dangerzone979 i mean we're playing Kotor2, so
[2:16:33] <+caffienatedjedi> Sorry, we are only space cops
[2:16:33] <%Superspider51> The Telos police force has no jurisdiction on Telos
[2:16:37] <bimblehim> ACAB
[2:16:42] <%DatAsuna> Canon only counts when we're playing canon games
[2:16:46] <leonsnixon> 1312
[2:16:49] <siamzero94> Woolie, they took SLAVES in the first game
[2:16:53] <Samm815> @DatAsuna true, so Bao is a zabrak?
[2:16:58] <+tearknack> @brookstar you can spoilers with all companions except the returning fighter, and the droids
[2:17:02] <%DatAsuna> yes bao is zabrak
[2:17:12] <Samm815> @DatAsuna an Idorian Zabrak?
[2:17:16] <Psyramics> It's Telos Station Security, their jurisdiction ends once the station does. Telos itself is lawless
[2:17:16] <Dakuu75> thin out their numbers lol
[2:17:25] <brookstar> @tearknack thanks man.
[2:17:26] <Iwashi94> the canucks?!
[2:17:28] <siamzero94> GODDAMN HIPPIES
[2:17:33] <resloxxx> Oops TehePelo
[2:17:35] <$SirGO0SE> I do find it weird that jedi/sith aren't supposed to be well known by the common folk but there's a race that is wildly transfigured based on their alignment lol
[2:17:35] <%DatAsuna> Anyway, I love Bao dur
[2:17:35] <+doc_ock_rokc> What carves do they give
[2:17:37] <Iwashi94> those pesky Canadians
[2:17:38] <%DatAsuna> He's underrated
[2:17:38] <Maleicus> cannoks actually eat anything
[2:17:38] <Samm815> No wait Ithorians are the slugs.
[2:17:44] <Reizie_Etherealm> Proof of a hero starts playing in the distance*
[2:17:44] <Madbearv> don't tell him
[2:17:46] <+dieselssb> dieselssb subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:17:46] <%DatAsuna> People hate him cause he's soft spoken
[2:17:46] <%Grayhammatter> ROCKET PEACE

[2:18:34] <%RJay80> woolieSMUG Clap
[2:18:37] <@Commando_Joe> You're already high level
[2:18:38] <+tearknack> also granny a bitch
[2:18:48] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Granny
[2:18:49] <Dangerzone979> I'm saying that Assaj being a Dathomirian Zabrack is canon, besides her being a ratataki would have been more confusing for TCW's target audience who likely have no idea what a Ratataki even is.
[2:18:54] <%GeneralSCPatton> woolieF woolieF_HF
[2:18:58] <leonsnixon> Leave Granny behind
[2:19:03] <StarlitStunner> Kreia is wife
[2:19:18] <Samm815> @Dangerzone979 well then introduce them.
[2:19:23] <+tearknack> @Dangerzone979 we know its canon, we just don't care
[2:19:25] <+chiluzza> Bao-dur is required you cant remove him
[2:19:30] <%DatAsuna> @Dangerzone979 And I'm saying it's different between the two. There's no need to try and correct me by just saying half of what I said like it's new.

[2:22:17] <+Graem> There are real life animals that can change their sex post-birth if they sense the family is too low on a specific sex so this makes about as much sense

[2:26:42] <notenoughgirls> i just checked the dathomirian zabraks have natural markings that they embellish with tattoos
[2:26:47] <indig0bird> Granny hates him purely out of racism
[2:26:51] <%DatAsuna> She calls him "the alien"
[2:26:53] <SeruraRenge> she hates him because he went through shit and didn't come out stronger
[2:26:54] <Deadbulky> Kappa
[2:26:54] <Reizie_Etherealm> LUL

[2:28:10] <ZeeJiggle> EXP Boyz
[2:28:11] <Redblood801> Look brudda, I'm just saying that Czerka is run by the Al-Bhed
[2:28:12] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Kath Hounds
[2:28:13] <notenoughgirls> two of the dudes on the jedi council were iridonian zabraks but dont look nearly as cool
[2:28:13] <ralphfromdk> kath hounds?
[2:28:17] <%DatAsuna> Kinrath @WoolieVersus
[2:28:18] <nikoloas_> kath hounds
[2:28:21] <CrabSlacks> space capitalism is killing the republic
[2:28:21] <Samm815> I can see why he followed you.
[2:28:22] <+tearknack> @WoolieVersus woolie, v, you might want to give Boa-Dur punch accuracy gloves
[2:28:25] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Kath hounds on Dantooine?
[2:28:30] <Tucker0603> kath hounds
[2:28:33] <%gatorafan> Begining Minh Maxing
[2:28:38] <mihokspawn> The only cooler answer to "you lost your arm" is "NO I DIDNT Is right there"
[2:28:39] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1229464161366794241?s=19
[2:28:42] <Maleicus> kath hounds still around
[2:28:44] <@SoushinSen> soushi2Maxed
[2:28:45] <availablethor> I feel like this guy is proto-Garrus
[2:28:45] <Samm815> cath hounds?
[2:28:45] <@Commando_Joe> this is an invasive species
[2:28:48] <Archmortal> I really love his opinion because it's not "destroy Czerka" it's "if the government would stop letting rampant fucking capitalism ruin everything we'd be good"
[2:28:49] <@Commando_Joe> not natural
[2:28:52] <SeruraRenge> They're not even natural life, they were brought from offworld
[2:28:59] <indig0bird> Should you keep leveling him up?
[2:29:02] <%Grayhammatter> better punch
[2:29:11] <%Superspider51> @WoolieVersus GIVE HIM THE PUNCH GLOVES!
[2:29:20] <Samm815> @availablethor but more creepy.
[2:29:23] <leonsnixon> That jump attack is ridiculous
[2:29:24] <indig0bird> Woolie, punch gloves
[2:29:25] <+tearknack> dantooine again, hmmm
[2:29:30] <%RioGascar> it was brought in to control herbivores...then it ate them all...so yeah invasive
[2:29:30] <+Llewelln> give the punch gloves
[2:29:36] <zocano> Ya that’s the downside with high int in this system unfortunately
[2:29:36] <Imsoverylazy> Dantooine but the enemies are way more annoying
[2:29:37] <leonsnixon> Give him gloves
[2:29:40] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> Don't miss the footlocker behind the shuttle
[2:29:40] <SeruraRenge> not counting the part of the game that is literally dantooine again
[2:29:40] <%Grayhammatter> give the punch gloves
[2:29:41] <+Llewelln> Punch gloves
[2:29:47] <zocano> At some point, you’re not even allowed to assign skill points
[2:29:47] <Tucker0603> give him PUNCH GLOVES
[2:29:54] <zocano> It’s a bit of a buzz killer
[2:29:54] <siamzero94> If only Reggie were here, he would guide Woolie's hips to gloves
[2:29:57] <mihokspawn> Punchy GLOVES
[2:29:57] <RrenKrieg> also hidden cache next to ship
[2:29:59] <kkjingles> Punch boyz pls
[2:30:11] <RrenKrieg> scrape map
[2:30:18] <rsg220> replace level up sound with a cash register
[2:30:20] <WanderingBard> Items by shuttle
[2:30:21] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Stasis is great
[2:30:46] <Redblood801> Don't forget the hidden cache
[2:31:00] <+tearknack> at this point punch gloves will probably have to be a sidenote in a donation or soemthing
[2:31:01] <SeruraRenge> seems like animals almost only ever drop shit when it's for a quest
[2:31:03] <+tearknack> rip punch gloves
[2:31:03] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> dont forget the footlocker behind the shuttle
[2:31:06] <Reizie_Etherealm> Don't forget to carve after you slay
[2:31:07] <Tucker0603> don't forget to give mellow maul punch gloves for more accuracy
[2:31:26] <lh_Weiss> punch gloves :'(
[2:31:30] <+tearknack> sicne they don't really look at chat during the stream
[2:31:40] <notenoughgirls> we will never get cache or punch gloves
[2:31:46] <RrenKrieg> very sad
[2:32:03] <HideousDeity> Check behind the crashed shuttle for a hidden cache.
[2:32:13] <Redblood801> You are filled with the Shii-Cho Form
[2:32:13] <%DatAsuna> The simplest of the forms
[2:32:17] <%RioGascar> Its here cause it wasnt in kotor 1 up front and was hidden mechanic
[2:32:21] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Despite everything, it's still you
[2:32:29] <+dezimaly> how long have they been playing
[2:32:30] <+tearknack> i don't think hilight messages really does anything
[2:32:34] <+tearknack> !uptime
[2:32:35] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 32 minutes
[2:32:40] <leonsnixon> They’re not going to see the cache
[2:32:42] <Samm815> Light Saber Forms~!
[2:32:57] <SiegeJay> Feel like a hero yet?
[2:32:57] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> did he say "some fundies?"
[2:33:19] <notenoughgirls> damnit
[2:33:30] <Samm815> quicker to get to ground
[2:33:46] <%RioGascar> Considering bioware didnt handle vehicles for a real long time
[2:33:48] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus there a reason you haven't given punch boi punch gloves?
[2:34:09] <%RioGascar> and even then the mako was a mess until andromeda
[2:34:11] <+Llewelln> solo mode
[2:34:16] <+tearknack> they're not reading chat
[2:34:26] <Maleicus> yeah it triggers a cutscene
[2:34:29] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> It's fine. It's no big deal
[2:34:30] <+tearknack> don't think there's any point in botheirng to try and remind them
[2:34:57] <+tearknack> if anyone really cares, but it in your odnation messages i guess?
[2:35:03] <+tearknack> put
[2:35:06] <+tearknack> donation
[2:35:13] <+tearknack> god i cnanot spell
[2:35:13] <T_Sasquatch> They won't read it aloud but they look
[2:35:14] <zocano> Lotta work for 200 xp
[2:35:19] <+tearknack> aaaaaaaaaaa
[2:35:55] <DocMadfox> Just micro it
[2:35:55] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:36:12] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Maybe its just a blaster in his pocket
[2:36:13] <Merkensteiner> Maclunky
[2:36:15] <+sunriser101> PokGardevoir PokMewtwo MindManners
[2:36:54] <+MrRabbles> Bao is your boy
[2:36:58] <leonsnixon> A bounty for being a good boy
[2:37:06] <Archmortal> THERE'S NO TIME, especially not for punch gloves
[2:37:09] <+MrRabbles> Ma Clunky gang
[2:37:12] <Redblood801> Maclunky
[2:37:16] <SeruraRenge> Bao-dur's line delivery always feels...off. And i don't mean because of the PTSD, I mean he just talks wierd
[2:37:17] <Madbearv> man Vinny's gonna sue somebody
[2:37:18] <+tearknack> no time for punch glvoes ever
[2:37:20] <Psyramics> just trigger the mines, who cares
[2:37:29] <+Llewelln> yolo
[2:37:31] <StarlitStunner> Eat maclanky
[2:37:37] <T_Sasquatch> Xpppp
[2:37:39] <notenoughgirls> i love the scene on narr shaddaa where they lampshade the shooting thing
[2:37:43] <siamzero94> MOREWHERETHATCAMEFROM
[2:37:44] <Rich_In_Antioxidants> What you're supposed to do for the mines is keep the party away, solo mode, do the cutscene then draw the two away from the mines to fight them THEN recover the mines
[2:37:46] <zocano> I really like his extremely quiet reserved VA
[2:37:52] <zocano> Always liked it
[2:37:54] <%Grayhammatter> pew pew pew
[2:37:55] <%derap41> More where that came from
[2:37:56] <+Llewelln> tank it Atton
[2:37:57] <DasFreekman> gherkin
[2:37:58] <Redblood801> Look at the shoot bangs
[2:37:59] <+MrRabbles> ratatatat
[2:38:04] <+MeTaylor> what's up everyone
[2:38:06] <leonsnixon> So fun
[2:38:08] <rsg220> PURE PAZAAK
[2:38:08] <bimblehim> plink plink
[2:38:12] <+MrRabbles> atton actually dying
[2:38:26] <FeralRageGaming> what is this, storm trooper aim?
[2:38:31] <DasFreekman> time to even the odds
[2:38:33] <+Llewelln> level ups fully heal
[2:39:02] <SeruraRenge> the constant musical stings
[2:39:03] <Psyramics> they're saving Atton levels for his prestige class
[2:39:04] <MrMuncho> oh wow, I actually catch the elusive Woolie in his natural habitat.
[2:39:06] <gade177> Will Woolie be as evil as possible?
[2:39:23] <Iwashi94> hamon arm extend
[2:39:23] <+tearknack> @gade177 Woolie is playing "light side"
[2:39:29] <+Llewelln> @Psyramics good point
[2:39:31] <gade177> Damn it!
[2:39:37] <%netrac> Jedi Relativist
[2:39:38] <+tearknack> (he has a slave, and is a murderer, but he's making LS choices generally)
[2:39:39] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Desh?
[2:40:10] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's fiiiiiiiine, Jedi love slavery
[2:40:10] <SeruraRenge> the slave was the lesser of two evils. How is it the light side choice to give her back to the bf who wagered her in a bet?
[2:40:14] <%gatorafan> Damn, not even Barth now
[2:40:18] <OmniSTylez> atton is alright
[2:40:24] <OmniSTylez> he did shiz
[2:40:29] <Redblood801> Delayed Light Side Points
[2:40:39] <%MichaelDood> @gatorafan i noticed that too LUL
[2:40:41] <%Superspider51> PUNCH GLOVES!
[2:40:43] <gade177> The interesting thing about this game is that it takes a more realistic approach to Star Wars. Meaning that basically everybody's an asshole.
[2:40:44] <%Grayhammatter> punch gloves!
[2:40:47] <DavianJ> I should be watching the new episode, but i'm here instead. Good decision I think
[2:40:54] <Archmortal> puuuuunch gloooooooves
[2:41:00] <%Grayhammatter> UH
[2:41:01] <leonsnixon> They cannot see your cries for punch gloves
[2:41:01] <raichu1972> lol I can't believe I didn't know this was also recorded live until now
[2:41:09] <+tearknack> @SeruraRenge the optimal ls path is you take her to the BF, and then she says fuck you to him, and goes off on her own
[2:41:17] <OmniSTylez> i like how kreia is written over everyone else in kotor 2
[2:41:19] <notenoughgirls> the jedi knowingly left all the slavery on tattooine intact
[2:41:22] <jamesthebrave> I wouldn't say everybody's an asshole but I do like that most of the party can't seem to stand each other most of the time
[2:41:26] <%TRILLTURBAN> Check the Messages Log in the Journal to see it
[2:41:30] <raichu1972> really wanted to watch y'all play KOTOR but I was super sick of seeing Paragus after how much I've played :P
[2:41:54] <zocano> The space hippies ain’t wrong
[2:42:02] <SeruraRenge> @tearknack Considering the twi'lek are an entire species of slaves, at least you keeping her means she's kept safe...as long as you don't play an asshole
[2:42:02] <zocano> Literally a character that is all about that
[2:42:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> You'rethinking Madalorian Battle Armor
[2:42:37] <%MichaelDood> stylin' and/or profilin'
[2:42:38] <FeralRageGaming> Leaves menu... *DUN*
[2:42:39] <SeruraRenge> stop with the musical stings!
[2:42:41] <GarbageNirvana> That fucking stinger every time they leave the menu
[2:42:46] <%gatorafan> DUUUUUUUUNNN daedra1DrunkTibs
[2:42:47] <leonsnixon> Why would a combat suit be on a random monster?
[2:43:02] <Maleicus> it ate the suit
[2:43:02] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:43:02] <DasFreekman> fucking chill John williams
[2:43:05] <Iwashi94> call paige!
[2:43:07] <%DatAsuna> Don't tell paige
[2:43:09] <Redblood801> Ganbare Skeleton!
[2:43:11] <%Grayhammatter> don't give up, skeleton
[2:43:13] <rsg220> *Jeremy Soule
[2:43:14] <Maleicus> they eat everything and you gut them for items
[2:43:16] <notenoughgirls> it ate someone and the person was just digested i guess
[2:43:17] <+tearknack> @SeruraRenge suuuuuuuure. also, the twi'lek aren't a planet of slaves - the dudes are kind of uggo so they tend to get off fine
[2:43:21] <%MichaelDood> Skeleton! (nothing)
[2:43:21] <GarbageNirvana> Oh hey, Corpse Nothing has family
[2:43:25] <leonsnixon> Paige!
[2:43:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> FortHype FortHype FortHype FortHype
[2:43:27] <%gatorafan> Skeleton (Bone)
[2:43:30] <%GeneralSCPatton> @leonsnixon They actually had to pull the armor out of its colon. It ate a guy with more gear than skill.
[2:43:45] <Reizie_Etherealm> SWING FIRST
[2:43:45] <+Llewelln> banzai
[2:43:58] <SeruraRenge> @tearknack Ryloth is such an inhospitable shithole that they regularly sell their own children into slavery because even that is better than living on Ryloth
[2:44:10] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Zandatsu
[2:44:25] <CrabSlacks> no shut up it's a light side power though
[2:44:27] <notenoughgirls> will they find the cache in this area and will it trigger v to remember the one by the shuttle? place your bets
[2:44:40] <DocMadfox> I had Oral Surgery and wasn't properly put to sleep and it was fucking horrific enough
[2:44:41] <%Superspider51> 50 on they don't find it
[2:44:43] <bendatron> GER
[2:44:45] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I mean if its clean kill youd never feel anything
[2:44:52] <leonsnixon> The beauty of light side powers
[2:44:59] <Redblood801> 10 Dollarydoos they don't find one
[2:45:07] <indig0bird> guys you missed one of the hidden chaches
[2:45:11] <indig0bird> Caches*
[2:45:19] <notenoughgirls> "one of"
[2:45:33] <indig0bird> I mean, both so far
[2:45:46] <leonsnixon> It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you
[2:45:52] <Daxalog> It was just dodging
[2:45:57] <+tearknack> @SeruraRenge My knowledge of ryloth comes from its depiction in the X-wing novels from the 90s, where it was pretty bad, but also unde imperial rule, so, ya'know. no idea what it's like in kotor canon, don't think it ever comes up
[2:46:01] <%Prevot> regen from the feet? woolieREGGIEFUL
[2:46:16] <indig0bird> There's a "hidden" cache behind the crashed ship at the beginning and if you hug the other wall, opposite of the beach, you find another
[2:46:16] <HideousDeity> Does Woolie read chat?
[2:46:19] <jorniev> what corpse_
[2:46:22] <leonsnixon> No
[2:46:34] <indig0bird> He does but doesn't interact with it for the YouTube VoD
[2:46:38] <+tearknack> @HideousDeity sometimes, but very rarely, and he will generally not acknowledge it
[2:46:42] <%GeneralSCPatton> ...
[2:46:46] <arkv01> "yerp" "yep" "... wanna cross lightsabers together?" "... yerp"
[2:46:53] <%gatorafan> you are background
[2:46:54] <notenoughgirls> oh?
[2:46:59] <Daxalog> An animated Prop
[2:47:12] <%Irridium> you render at half the framerate in the distance
[2:47:14] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Thats not even an NPC
[2:47:14] <konarius> it is not even animated
[2:47:15] <raichu1972> @tearknack iirc Ryloth is usually pretty shit because it's under the official/unofficial jurisdiction of the Hutts most of the time combined with it being a terrible place in general
[2:47:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Its a static object
[2:47:21] <SeruraRenge> @tearknack The planet is in tidal lock so like our moon, one side is always facing the sun and the other always facing away due to perfect synchronized rotation with its orbit. The sunny side is so hot people can only live deep underground, the dark side is frozen
[2:47:26] <konarius> not even physics
[2:47:26] <Ahk_90> You are less than a corpse, you could be a random ass rock
[2:47:47] <%gatorafan> you only exist because the game engine couldn't handle to out something more important where you are.
[2:47:57] <leonsnixon> It is landscape dressing
[2:47:59] <SoaringLettuce> the lowest level of human is "background art"
[2:48:18] <+MrRabbles> Skeleton bag distant relative of corpse (Nothing)
[2:48:20] <siamzero94> They eat anything
[2:48:20] <SeruraRenge> Ryloth is canonically considered one of the worst places to live in the galaxy
[2:48:33] <%netrac> The lowest form of human is crowd sprite
[2:48:36] <SeruraRenge> purely because of the environment
[2:48:38] <%alrobot2014> dog with a sniper rifle
[2:48:39] <indig0bird> You missed one of those near the crushed ship
[2:48:52] <andrex2311> I WAS HERE
[2:48:53] <DemonicHoward> or the dogs in ds2 that have the black axe
[2:48:57] <SeruraRenge> they're space goats
[2:48:58] <+doc_ock_rokc> SNIPER WOLF NOOOOOO
[2:49:02] <+MrRabbles> mitochondria's power knows no bounds
[2:49:07] <leonsnixon> Sometimes you get hungry and eat a drag grenade
[2:49:07] <Redblood801> I just lost 10 Dollarydoos
[2:49:09] <%Javaa01> Komrade Dog didn't have time to load his Mosin
[2:49:16] <+theAncopro> if its disassembled maybe
[2:49:16] <Reizie_Etherealm> LUL
[2:49:19] <%GeneralSCPatton> VORE
[2:49:25] <+theAncopro> and its a great dane
[2:49:31] <%Superspider51> well I lost 50
[2:49:38] <%Superspider51> didn't say 50 what but I lost 50
[2:49:39] <notenoughgirls> amazing
[2:49:44] <%RioGascar> with right determination you can vore anything with any hole
[2:49:48] <notenoughgirls> 50 seconds of your life
[2:50:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> @riogascar sweetc2SmugCheeks
[2:50:04] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[2:50:05] <%Superspider51> I lose 50 seconds of my life every second anyway
[2:50:14] <%gatorafan> Abyss (nothing)
[2:50:25] <notenoughgirls> that's speedrun tech
[2:50:40] <leonsnixon> Stealth bois
[2:50:49] <wegood456> Ladies and gentlemen! It's the WOOLIEVS SHOW!
[2:51:15] <siamzero94> Why would you do it that far away?
[2:51:18] <leonsnixon> Press X to doubt
[2:51:26] <siamzero94> Nice Atton
[2:52:07] <ThePimpGuin> its called sniper shot fora reason
[2:52:11] <@Commando_Joe> You're trying to shoot the turret, you;re trying to disarm the mine
[2:52:13] <@Commando_Joe> It makes sense
[2:52:24] <%Irridium> because you shoot them with the gun and don't shoot the mines with gun
[2:52:24] <leonsnixon> Sniping
[2:52:30] <zocano> The turrets are visible the mines are “hidden”
[2:52:46] <%RioGascar> this stopped the child rio
[2:52:49] <SeruraRenge> wow my internet just tanked there, took me like 2 minutes to get back to the stream
[2:52:51] <+MrRabbles> or you send a companion to this minefield to die
[2:52:52] <%RioGascar> cause the child rio is stupid
[2:53:21] <RrenKrieg> 2 more
[2:53:30] <SeruraRenge> im convinced this game had very little testing, judging by the initial release
[2:53:38] <%RioGascar> im surprised they didnt make an alt path that was available for those with say different stat builds
[2:53:39] <+Mindtrick_Matt> I just ran through
[2:53:44] <indig0bird> By then you have [REDACTED] and they can walk through mines
[2:54:00] <+HurtboxTV> I want to roll stat arrays twice with 4 D6's and take the three highest dies
[2:54:09] <Psyramics> Of course it had very little testing, it's an Obsidian game
[2:54:15] <+Llewelln> out of combat they consider you have all the time you want, so auto succeed
[2:54:24] <serpenttucker> I like it when it gives you the option only in certain spots, but you can do it for free. Alternatively, a partial reconfigure also works for me.
[2:54:39] <+Mindtrick_Matt> You can also just sacrifice a party member and deal with the guns with everyone else
[2:54:43] <Ahk_90> "He's about to get meat"
[2:54:46] <Redblood801> RIP Atton
[2:54:51] <%gatorafan> Corpse (Atton)
[2:54:53] <siamzero94> Atton is unbreakable
[2:55:00] <serpenttucker> Those turrets do not appreciate your sick flips
[2:55:04] <%Superspider51> you missed a cache
[2:55:10] <Safarihat> @WoolieVersus cache!
[2:55:23] <OldManDeckardCain> look at this good slave owner Kappa
[2:55:25] <notenoughgirls> we will never get that cache
[2:55:30] <%Irridium> by the ship
[2:55:30] <%RioGascar> *dark* blue
[2:55:33] <%RioGascar> damnit
[2:55:33] <Safarihat> behind the ship
[2:55:34] <%alrobot2014> @WoolieVersus next to the shuttle
[2:55:35] <iamyungdannow> Such good posture
[2:55:35] <%Superspider51> by the ship at the start
[2:55:38] <indig0bird> Back at the crushed ship
[2:55:39] <+caffienatedjedi> Behind shuttle
[2:55:39] <notenoughgirls> GOD
[2:55:46] <%gatorafan> DUUUUUUUUNNN daedra1DrunkTibs
[2:55:46] <ScreamLord> The Way of the Open Palm is unveiling before you
[2:55:47] <+doc_ock_rokc> NEVER WILL
[2:55:52] <zocano> You’re not missing anything
[2:55:53] <leonsnixon> Dun Dun DUUUN
[2:55:57] <+doc_ock_rokc> Because Disney can't let good writing happen
[2:56:02] <%medinaj1990> such a snooty ass jedi
[2:56:03] <zocano> It’s not anywhere near necessary
[2:56:10] <%alpacasintophats> tis at the crushed ship my good sirs
[2:56:11] <WanderingBard> no. 2 is at the shuttle
[2:56:23] <%RioGascar> any old CRPG game would BE AMAZING in a non jank shit engine
[2:56:24] <Redblood801> Watch them not find the cache and it contains 20 lightsabers
[2:56:27] <notenoughgirls> check the map for places you havent walked
[2:56:46] <siamzero94> OH FINALLY
[2:56:51] <notenoughgirls> god damn
[2:56:51] <%RioGascar> baldurs gate would benefit from a modern engine that doesnt die when a cgi cutscene plays
[2:57:01] <Zohare> I'm calling a couple grenades being ni it
[2:57:05] <terminallyCapriciousz> My OCD can finally be laid to rest

[2:57:37] <HideousDeity> @zocano gotta fill the fanny pack.

[2:58:05] <notenoughgirls> finally all of us can live
[2:58:23] <zocano> 500 xp in a game where you will have 50,000+ in the end
[2:58:25] <Redblood801> Fucking Woolie and his dumb luck
[2:58:25] <%krispen_wa> RIOT BUSTAAAAH
[2:58:27] <%Superspider51> now we just need to get the punch gloves equipped
[2:58:39] <T_Sasquatch> Predictabo
[2:58:45] <%GeneralSCPatton> Short hair, abs, buster
[2:58:49] <goose_attack_almanac> Woolie in the House
[2:58:49] <StarlitStunner> Bustah Wolf
[2:58:50] <OldManDeckardCain> short hair, mecha, mahvel....
[2:58:51] <%MrMoonGoose> Bustin' makes him feel good
[2:58:55] <%DatAsuna> I did
[2:58:57] <rubbishbinge> megaton kill buster!
[2:58:58] <RrenKrieg> i have
[2:59:02] <+tearknack> not for long
[2:59:05] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Tomboy Buster Kappa
[2:59:08] <leonsnixon> Bustin bustin bustin
[2:59:11] <+aishman> Played what now?
[2:59:16] <RrenKrieg> dual sonic pistols on my gunslinger-jedi master
[2:59:18] <konarius> controller doesn't have a florish button?
[2:59:23] <siamzero94> Riot Buster? That's just sprayin' your Machine gun into a crowd
[2:59:29] <+aishman> Also, I'm shocked Woolie has yet to play Jade Empire
[2:59:30] <RrenKrieg> basically debuff everyone
[2:59:33] <%Double_Tap_That> !uptime
[2:59:33] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 59 minutes
[2:59:40] <%Double_Tap_That> !motivated
[2:59:40] <@Moobot> 679 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[2:59:50] <terminallyCapriciousz> !motivated
[3:00:07] <GarbageNirvana> Jade Empire was such a unique thing, shame it didn't get more traction
[3:00:08] <serpenttucker> Making the ranged weapons more interesting also helps
[3:00:16] <serpenttucker> cause blasters are BORING
[3:00:27] <Manly_Rose> Is there even a legal way to play Jade Empire ?
[3:00:30] <indig0bird> You can use Ion Grenades
[3:00:32] <zocano> Finally a reasonable option taken
[3:00:33] <@Commando_Joe> Does anyone know if you can deflect sonic blasts? Since it's...you know...sound?
[3:00:34] <ShiningAxis> Can you grenade mines?
[3:00:34] <Maleicus> yes
[3:00:38] <Maleicus> you buy iy
[3:00:44] <jorniev> its not only blasters in star wars, i want a jedi with a shotgun
[3:00:47] <indig0bird> Just throw bombs lol
[3:00:47] <Maleicus> it
[3:00:58] <T_Sasquatch> I've seen that character before i swear
[3:01:06] <+Saanspoof> Has woolie stopped pretending he's light side yet?
[3:01:09] <leonsnixon> A sonic blast could be deflected with an explosion
[3:01:23] <serpenttucker> @jorniev A jedi flipping around like yoda preforming gun-kata's
[3:01:26] <GarbageNirvana> I mean they use the same twi'lek model for a lot of stuff in these games
[3:01:32] <notenoughgirls> playing light side in kotor 1 as anything other than a scoundrel is a nightmare
[3:01:33] <Retinolgaming> Chupa wunga gilfa moon2S
[3:01:52] <Redblood801> Lady, you shoulda found a different line of work. Like at Twerka Industries! We have a great dental plan and we offer pensions!
[3:02:07] <$QueequegTheater> Oh goody punchboi
[3:02:16] <%Superspider51> if only he had the gloves
[3:02:32] <+Saanspoof> I'm betting V is leading him light side just long enough to get a certain character, then dropping all pretenses of light
[3:03:00] <zocano> Meh, the light side path is more interesting
[3:03:02] <+tearknack> playing kotor 2 modded, and wow, i forgot what a snooze the genderlocked companion woolie won't be getting is
[3:03:06] <notenoughgirls> im pretty sure theyre sparing all the [redacted]s
[3:03:08] <terminallyCapriciousz> Woolie not naming his save files HURTS.
[3:03:14] <zocano> Specifically one late game pivotal scene
[3:03:21] <%SlickRick11211> who is this guy. i like hime
[3:03:26] <%SlickRick11211> him
[3:03:29] <+Saanspoof> yeah but dark side is substantially funnier
[3:03:30] <%Superspider51> thank god for the mod that lets you pick either @tearknack
[3:03:35] <T_Sasquatch> Ay black dude
[3:03:39] <TomFrank> blando LUL
[3:03:41] <%DatAsuna> Black man, purple armour, must be a woolie
[3:03:43] <+Llewelln> I played Female to get the male sidekick...very disappointing
[3:03:43] <+Saanspoof> and woolie's groaned a lot at the light side choices
[3:03:45] <Halospaz117> Player face I think
[3:03:49] <GarbageNirvana> 🅱️ lando
[3:03:56] <leonsnixon> I think they are just going to incrementally become light side aligned
[3:03:58] <+blackmatrix3> Default skin looking dude
[3:03:58] <jorniev> blando carl is a
[3:04:09] <zocano> The main story’s light side is what I’m speaking to
[3:04:10] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:04:22] <zocano> There’s plenty of snooty normal light side stuff
[3:04:24] <MidnightBurst12> the balls on this man
[3:04:25] <serpenttucker> That's a neat little random bit of RNG, where certain no-name NPCs get changed up based on what class you start with along with other factors
[3:04:28] <Maleicus> i mean jedi is not unstoppable
[3:04:45] <leonsnixon> Just grenade these fools
[3:04:54] <GarbageNirvana> A good Order 66 can take most of 'em down
[3:04:56] <raichu1972> the good think about this game is that you can go full light side without also being a pretentious asshat
[3:04:57] <+tearknack> @Superspider51 i played kotor2 way back in my "ew won't play girls phase", so i never really got the male companion, and never really saw him much
[3:04:59] <siamzero94> You made him bad woolie
[3:05:01] <notenoughgirls> the male sidekick is wild. like ive literally been able to [redacted] him in the first conversation with him
[3:05:01] <raichu1972> it just takes a little longer
[3:05:10] <jorniev> im sorry if you are not a stih a mandalorian or a droid called hk get the fuck of my face
[3:05:13] <Pillagius> Bao_Dur was a storm trooper when he was a soldier
[3:05:16] <zocano> Ya raichu
[3:05:20] <DocMadfox> HK literally gives you a "how to" guide on how to kill a Jedi
[3:05:35] <%krispen_wa> This is the hardest area in the game
[3:05:37] <Redblood801> Kill them all Fann Y'Pak
[3:05:38] <%krispen_wa> bar none
[3:05:39] <siamzero94> Atton ate jedis for breakfast
[3:05:50] <%Superspider51> @tearknack I prefer doing "canon" playthroughs and pick the femxile but the Handmaiden is still so much better
[3:05:53] <%Grayhammatter> uh oh
[3:05:55] <zocano> I was light side in the main story but picked plenty of utilitarian or rude options throughout
[3:05:55] <DigitalMajestic> Ooh I HATED this fight
[3:05:57] <@Moobot> Please don't fill up the entire chat, @gastherobots
[3:06:04] <+Llewelln> I like to force push the enemy while companions kill
[3:06:05] <%krispen_wa> just use the mod that lets you fucc handmaiden as a girrrl
[3:06:15] <Psyramics> V playing the role of 'out of mana healer' for this LP
[3:06:25] <%krispen_wa> and by fucc handmaiden i mean visas because she's actual waifu
[3:06:28] <gastherobots> Which is a shame because if they actually properly balanced it I feel like it could be good.
[3:06:31] <+Estuko> @krispen_wa As much as I love the hand maiden, I want to nestle myself ont Visas Marr's lap and fall asleep
[3:06:46] <Reizie_Etherealm> Sick spin slash
[3:06:51] <Pillagius> V's a na-V-gator in this playthrough cohhK
[3:06:54] <+tearknack> @krispen_wa i'm recruiting everyone except for the super had lock cause that choice would not make sense
[3:07:04] <+Saanspoof> Man there's three, damn, four counting kreia, girls in this game that hits all the woolie boxes
[3:07:05] <+tearknack> @krispen_wa mods are great, big lesbian time
[3:07:39] <zocano> Unfortunately that mod has really awkward voice splicing that I cannot get over
[3:07:45] <zocano> To make it “work”
[3:07:51] <+tearknack> eh
[3:07:55] <notenoughgirls> visas and handmaiden are both good
[3:08:02] <+tearknack> i'm playing with the sound off while i watch woolie stream
[3:08:04] <leonsnixon> The pathing in this game is still pretty bad lol
[3:08:04] <+tearknack> so its fine
[3:08:13] <zocano> Fair
[3:08:18] <+Llewelln> @krispen_wa which mod lets you have the handmaiden as female PC?
[3:08:30] <Pillagius> Moving objects out of reach for jedi might be just a force of habit
[3:08:32] <+tearknack> @Llewelln there's at least two
[3:08:42] <%krispen_wa> partyswap and/or Handmaiden romance as female mod
[3:08:48] <+tearknack> yeah
[3:09:03] <%Superspider51> @zocano version I used didn't even bother with voice splicing but it was easy enough to ignore the "issues"
[3:09:03] <+tearknack> the first lets you get both, the secodn hard locks you into handmaiden, iirc
[3:09:33] <zocano> That shit annoys me super bad unfortunately
[3:09:37] <Pillagius> Imagine your TV remote being able to float around and shoot lazors?
[3:09:42] <+Llewelln> I am not able to find them in Workshop
[3:09:49] <+Saanspoof> are there any other options as femstarwar?
[3:09:53] <zocano> I’m the type that demands my skyrim mods be “lore friendly” so
[3:09:54] <%krispen_wa> the second mod has the voice splicing, partyswap just has the game assume you're the opposite gender
[3:09:57] <%Superspider51> you could be the change you want to make and make your own voice splice for it
[3:10:10] <%krispen_wa> it's on nexus, not workshop
[3:10:12] <leonsnixon> Fake chests
[3:10:22] <zocano> Not with my crippling depression I won’t tpYGOkuriboh
[3:10:23] <%krispen_wa> and deadlystream
[3:10:28] <+Llewelln> @krispen_wa k ty
[3:10:29] <+Saanspoof> oh right atton. forgot about him...
[3:10:44] <%derap41> Is that mask attached to his nose?
[3:10:46] <+tearknack> @Saanspoof disciple, atton
[3:10:47] <a_mad_dragon> looks like a robot moth landed on his face
[3:10:55] <%derap41> Cause his Jaw shouldn't be able to move like that with a mask
[3:10:58] <%Grayhammatter> hack the planet
[3:11:04] <+tearknack> god i'm so powerful already
[3:11:21] <+Saanspoof> kreia best girl
[3:11:21] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:11:39] <+tearknack> i'm on the elss interesting returning planet, i jsut recruited disciple, accidentally sent him home so i've only got two people in my party, and i'm stomping so hard
[3:12:01] <%derap41> I'm not a huge fan of this guy's voice
[3:12:11] <%krispen_wa> bao dur is good ASMR
[3:12:13] <zocano> Nah I love his VA
[3:12:19] <+tearknack> i like it but it is a bit quiet i think
[3:12:21] <Redblood801> We just saw those guys
[3:12:25] <%krispen_wa> ...general...
[3:12:33] <DocMadfox> It was also the Warrior Class of the Sith Empire
[3:12:42] <Reizie_Etherealm> Naga Sundown
[3:12:44] <+Saanspoof> My favorite thing to do in this game is play light just long enough to get "that" character and then go full dark. seeing a light side restricted character full evil is the most satisfying thing in almost any game
[3:12:45] <+tearknack> the melty boys
[3:12:50] <+tearknack> we like making noise
[3:12:51] <Redblood801> Naga Sadow and The Melty Boys
[3:12:51] <DocMadfox> Melty boysare not the Massasi
[3:13:04] <+tearknack> @Saanspoof i'm doing that for the first time this palythrough
[3:13:07] <%RedDragonMoth> Melty bois? so yavin 4 is a giant bathroom?
[3:13:08] <DocMadfox> Massasi are the red dreadlock boyz
[3:13:17] <+tearknack> only thing, iirc, i haven't done in kotor 2
[3:13:22] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Melty boiz playing Melty Blood
[3:13:34] <%Irridium> NO TIME
[3:13:34] <%krispen_wa> Melty Bois in the bathroom
[3:13:36] <Redblood801> Only 14 months Woolie!
[3:13:41] <+Saanspoof> @tearknack its so fun! hide the truth from the meters
[3:13:44] <%Superspider51> There's mods that give all the armors unique models
[3:14:06] <%JJCheeker> Obviously the people that sold the armor lie
[3:14:10] <%RioGascar> just change the colors
[3:14:13] <+Llewelln> I have the mod to give Darth Nihilus robes
[3:14:15] <siamzero94> And guess what planet you have to visit again?
[3:14:17] <%RioGascar> reuse the first games models?
[3:14:22] <rsg220> @Superspider51 is it on nexus?
[3:14:25] <manwithaxe> the Mandos committed cultural appropriation, stole from the ancient sith tribe
[3:14:26] <%MrMoonGoose> MODS MODS MODS MODS
[3:14:43] <+MARTIANxMADNESS> Gonna be honest. Giving Obsidian an out by saying they only had 14 months when they agreed to that development cycle is a pretty funny joke
[3:14:44] <%Superspider51> either nexus, steam or the kotor modding boards
[3:14:45] <notenoughgirls> that is actually a reasonable explanation
[3:14:47] <Redblood801> SWTOR is surprisingly still around
[3:14:48] <%krispen_wa> anything to move away from Zakuul
[3:14:55] <%krispen_wa> onslaught was a good correction
[3:14:57] <+tearknack> @WoolieVersus no, because the designs first appeared in comics in the 90s, not in kotor
[3:14:57] <DocMadfox> SWTOR is still surprisingly fun
[3:15:13] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Clone Wars getting a season 7 makes me so happy
[3:15:14] <+Saanspoof> i managed to get swtor fully working on my steam controller
[3:15:15] <siamzero94> money
[3:15:15] <%netrac> People overestimate how many people you need to sustain a mmo
[3:15:16] <Zebroneath> They are still updating Battlefront 2
[3:15:16] <+doc_ock_rokc> Resistance sucks
[3:15:17] <%krispen_wa> Resistance is also in its final season after 2 seasons
[3:15:17] <DemonicHoward> resistance is a separate thing
[3:15:17] <T_Sasquatch> Fuck rebels
[3:15:18] <zocano> TOR class stories are .... fine, not great but fine
[3:15:22] <+SarcFa> Swtor is still making money, just not hand over fist, its making enough to maintain and keep small story updates
[3:15:23] <SeruraRenge> Seriously EA, LET US HAVE AN OFFLINE VERSION OF THE GAME, IT'S A SINGLE-PLAYER GAME AT THIS POINT ANYWAY
[3:15:26] <+Mindtrick_Matt> The 3rd show Resistance has ended too
[3:15:28] <%GeneralSCPatton> @martianxmadness MMMMM, FUNNYYYYYYY JOKE!
[3:15:28] <prince_johnny_> Restiance is over now
[3:15:29] <serpenttucker> NOTHING SECRET ABOUT IT
[3:15:30] <notenoughgirls> ive never heard a single good thing about resistance
[3:15:34] <leonsnixon> TOYS
[3:15:42] <%RioGascar> Resistance finished a month ago
[3:15:43] <zocano> The sith emperor storyline is some bad shlock tho
[3:15:43] <+Mindtrick_Matt> Clone Wars is the only animated show running right now
[3:15:49] <%Superspider51> I've seen the first trailer's thumbnail and that is the extent of my knowledge on resistance
[3:15:49] <DemonicHoward> also clone wars was cancled many due to it being a cartoon network show when disney bought lucas
[3:15:51] <OldManDeckardCain> actual baby yoda LUL
[3:15:53] <TomFrank> Yung Yoda
[3:15:56] <+theAncopro> yoda with long flowing hair
[3:15:58] <+dongstomper69> theyre finally going to give us a yoda that fucks
[3:16:02] <leonsnixon> Sexy Yoda
[3:16:03] <jamesthebrave> BUFF BISHIE YODA
[3:16:06] <Manly_Rose> Young Yoda rocking that afro
[3:16:06] <Graywolf_the_45th> old man yoda, baby yoda, now we got tween yoda
[3:16:08] <%Javaa01> Yoda with a mohawk
[3:16:12] <DocMadfox> I like the TOR Inquisitor, Agent, Smuggler, and Bounty Hunter story, but I hate that the Bounty Hunter and Smuggler go to Zakuul
[3:16:12] <notenoughgirls> they're bringing back clone wars because it was unceremoniously canceled
[3:16:12] <HideousDeity> Please give Yoda emo hair.
[3:16:14] <StarlitStunner> Master Yaddle
[3:16:14] <rsg220> YODA SAMSON
[3:16:22] <manwithaxe> yoda with a rage against the machines Tshirt
[3:16:22] <%RioGascar> his name wont be yoda just to throw you off
[3:16:23] <leonsnixon> Emoda
[3:16:27] <+Saanspoof> i want darth maul style spider yoda
[3:16:33] <%JJCheeker> Making babies
[3:16:35] <SeruraRenge> @DocMadfox Go play the Sith Warrior storyline but do it light side
[3:16:36] <%krispen_wa> i would be cautiously ok wirh Dave Filoni writing an Old Republif series
[3:16:53] <%RioGascar> @leonsnixon I want to pat you on the back followed by a gut punch good sir
[3:17:25] <leonsnixon> LUL
[3:17:26] <%DatAsuna> Also resistance is already over
[3:17:29] <notenoughgirls> ive heard good things about the inquisitor storyline but i just cannot be bothered to willingly play an mmo
[3:17:37] <DocMadfox> @SeruraRenge Darkside Jaessa made me fucking hate the SW storyline
[3:17:54] <+Saanspoof> i need to get backon swtor i was enjoying my full evil jedi knight playthrough. makes the jedi look sooooo stupid
[3:17:56] <%DatAsuna> Inquisitor is big smugs
[3:18:00] <%krispen_wa> Inquisitor storyline is just you being the pettiest, evillest asshole
[3:18:04] <SeruraRenge> @notenoughgirls I hated the inquisitor storyline because it's full of so many plotholes that just tear the story apart once you think about it
[3:18:05] <%krispen_wa> its fun
[3:18:08] <%DatAsuna> Well nah
[3:18:16] <%Superspider51> lightside Inquisitor is also a wild ride
[3:18:18] <%DatAsuna> You can also be the guy who's changing the empire from the inside
[3:18:23] <zocano> Inquisitor is pure big dark side shlock but it’s fun because of it
[3:18:24] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[3:18:32] <%DatAsuna> The inquisitor story, rgeardless of light or dark is about going from rags to riches
[3:18:36] <%Superspider51> cause you end up in one of the highest positions for a sith despite being a goodie too shoes and no one can complain about it
[3:18:38] <%DatAsuna> From slave to ruler
[3:18:44] <%Superspider51> two"
[3:18:49] <zocano> None of the TOR class stories are like *good* stories, they can just be fun at times
[3:18:55] <gastherobots> @SeruraRenge you joke but I've legit seen people on the forums going "Man FUCK solo players! This game is an MMO, it's not fair for solo players to have access to everything!" in regards to allowing people to actually play the Oricon Operation/end to the dread masters story in solo... which you literally can't do atm.
[3:18:55] <SeruraRenge> @DocMadfox I like Jaesa because she's such an obvious tryhard
[3:18:57] <manwithaxe> you used to be real good tho
[3:19:00] <%krispen_wa> Agent story is good
[3:19:03] <Pillagius> @T_Sasquatch you don't say. Both Rebels and Clone Wars made mandalorians from badass warriors (with brightest image in ones head of Canderus doing an orbital halo jump riding a huge war-bot) into bunch of idiots incapable on level of droids in Phantom Menace
[3:19:05] <mbluky> greetings people
[3:19:05] <DocMadfox> @Superspider51 LS Inquisitor is the biggest troll in the Empire just by existing because he fucks with everyone's expectatins
[3:19:06] <%GeneralSCPatton> It's a Force Zenkai Boost. Your Force connection almost died and came back stronger.
[3:19:10] <+Saanspoof> imperial agent is awesome
[3:19:17] <rubbishbinge> you cant have TWO erupting burning fingers
[3:19:24] <%DatAsuna> That's cause being goodie two shoes still means killing lots of jedi and doing evil for the sake of the empire
[3:19:32] <notenoughgirls> oh wait it mayve been the agent i was thinking of
[3:19:34] <zocano> The class storylines are also incredibly restrained and burdened by the MMO format
[3:19:40] <%DatAsuna> Yeha inqusiitor trolling jedi is the best
[3:19:41] <leonsnixon> You ever punch with two fists at the same time?
[3:19:43] <+Saanspoof> @datasuna but you say nice things
[3:19:51] <%Superspider51> @DocMadfox playing lightside warrior or inquisitor is the best cause whenever you meet a Jedi and you aren't a massive asshole you can see the gears grind in their head as they attempt to compute what is going on
[3:20:00] <+Saanspoof> and thats what really matters
[3:20:01] <MattDemers> Big number vs do combo
[3:20:04] <SeruraRenge> @gastherobots My point is as long as it's tied to being logged in to a server, it can all die one day. If they give us an offline version, the game will be around forever without having to fuck with private servers
[3:20:05] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Master Flurry is crazy
[3:20:05] <CrabSlacks> flurry is bea
[3:20:07] <zocano> Nothing can be impactful or meaningful in choice and the world can’t reflect it because you’re playing an MMO
[3:20:10] <%DatAsuna> My inquisitor specifically was nice to normal people and a dick to anyone else with the force, jedi or sith. lol
[3:20:25] <notenoughgirls> i played a bit of the guardian story but i never got off tython
[3:20:25] <T_Sasquatch> @pillagius to be fair the mandlorian arc in rebels is aesthetic gorgeousness but yea
[3:20:31] <Iwashi94> do combo!
[3:20:33] <%Superspider51> if only they didn't fuck up Revan's story so hard
[3:20:36] <%DatAsuna> The jedi stories are th weakest imho
[3:20:36] <SeruraRenge> @zocano It can because they just straight up ignore the MMO part and treat it like a single-player game
[3:20:45] <%Superspider51> no spoilers but it is a shit ending to what kotor 1 and 2 built up
[3:20:46] <%alpacasintophats> the big number with the big swing
[3:20:54] <DocMadfox> @DatAsuna It's essentially what Woolie wants from being a Dark Side user who's a dick but not evil and everyone in universe is confused as fuck by that shit
[3:20:56] <mihokspawn> PAttack FTW
[3:20:57] <Redblood801> Why can't I do Big Number and Do Combo?
[3:20:57] <Pillagius> @T_Sasquatch well, that's the usual theme - it's visually great, but no substance behind it :(
[3:21:02] <zocano> Not following you @serurarenge ?
[3:21:03] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Whoever voiced the female inquisitor in SWTOR did a great job at being evil
[3:21:12] <manwithaxe> flurry is op
[3:21:19] <%DatAsuna> I prefer the male inquisitor voice, he does one of the audio books too and it's great
[3:21:20] <%krispen_wa> whoever voiced the female agent did a great job in making me turned on
[3:21:20] <kiritodarklord> there is no darkside nor a lightside there is only the force I will do what I must to keep the balance
[3:21:21] <%Irridium> I always max crit fluffy and power because each one gives you new animations
[3:21:25] <%krispen_wa> jo wyatt is a goddess
[3:21:32] <gastherobots> @SeruraRenge Oh I totally agree, just saying that A. "But subscriptions tho..." is going to stop that. And half the community for some bizarre reason actively wants it to remain only online as well.
[3:21:32] <DocMadfox> Male Inquisitor is great
[3:21:33] <%DatAsuna> Yeyeye
[3:21:34] <SeruraRenge> @zocano SWTOR doesn't even pretend to be an MMO, it's a single-player game that lets you do group content
[3:21:36] <%DatAsuna> fem hawke for life
[3:21:43] <DocMadfox> He sounds so upset with the "I'm not cute I'm deadly" line
[3:21:48] <+Saanspoof> @Enemy_In_Disguise honestly the fact that they had a different male female voice actor for all classes was insanely impressive
[3:21:54] <+tearknack> @SeruraRenge that sounds great for me
[3:21:56] <notenoughgirls> mandalorians in the shows dont get it nearly as bad as grievous though
[3:22:13] <SeruraRenge> @gastherobots SWTOR doesn't even make its money through subs, it makes it through the cartelmarket
[3:22:19] <%DatAsuna> @SeruraRenge IDK about that, Tython and Korriban are rife with RP guilds
[3:22:22] <%krispen_wa> Cartel Market is gacha
[3:22:31] <%Superspider51> the free to play model they put in is also fucked
[3:22:38] <+MrRabbles> the forms
[3:22:42] <DocMadfox> Might resub this weekend and go through the Inq story again.
[3:22:42] <zocano> Sure but none of the class storylines feel modular and fluid, they are locked to the specific order you’re “meant” to do in each Republic and Empire class
[3:22:42] <%Superspider51> cause they lock out rarest tier gear from you
[3:22:52] <Pillagius> @T_Sasquatch but thanks to Oberyn Martell being reincarnated as Mandalorian in Star Wars universe - we learned that what we seen in Rebels and Clone Wars was not the way
[3:22:55] <SeruraRenge> @gastherobots Therefore, it does not require you to be always online because the people who want to do that shit will be paying for that stuff anyway
[3:22:58] <leonsnixon> Lightsaber Forms woolieGLORY
[3:23:12] <%DatAsuna> But also you could still easily beat the whole story without purple tier gear anyways so whatever
[3:23:13] <+MrRabbles> star wars fighting game when
[3:23:17] <%DatAsuna> F2P is just a big demo
[3:23:21] <zocano> Everything feels burdened and restrained by the MMO format regardless of how much they “try” to ignore it
[3:23:27] <%krispen_wa> Shien Form with Master Crit Strike and Keen Sabers and Force Speed is sex
[3:23:29] <gastherobots> @SeruraRenge Oh god the Cartel is the worst. You're totally right.
[3:23:33] <leonsnixon> Teras Kasi exists
[3:23:42] <+Saanspoof> i've been playing a ton of blade and sorcery vr with star wars mods, i finally understand the point of dooku's curved hilt
[3:23:45] <%Superspider51> the only good part about F2P is it lets you finish any of the class stories, you just gotta delete your characters to make room for the next one
[3:23:56] <%DatAsuna> Teras kasi exists but it isn't what you use in hthis
[3:24:04] <zocano> You *can* play TOR as a single player game but that doesn’t mean the design of the class stories are free and unrestrained from being in an MMO
[3:24:08] <zocano> Which is a huge issue
[3:24:17] <Redblood801> The Fart Gas Returns!
[3:24:26] <leonsnixon> Gassed
[3:24:35] <SeruraRenge> I'm glad I was a sub back in the day because as long as you're a sub at once point in the game's history, you're Preferred status which gives you way more shit than F2P
[3:24:39] <%krispen_wa> SWTOR's story is hampered by infinite "go kill this many people" quests
[3:24:45] <DocMadfox> Woolie Vs. Fart Gas
[3:24:55] <%DatAsuna> @Superspider51 You can have 4 F2P characters
[3:24:56] <+Saanspoof> swtor is better with a steam controller honestly
[3:24:58] <TomFrank> PogChamp
[3:24:59] <Pillagius> Bam-o-Door
[3:24:59] <SeruraRenge> @krispen_wa There's way less of them than there used to be
[3:25:07] <%Superspider51> @DatAsuna thought it was 2
[3:25:22] <Enemy_In_Disguise> SWTOR’s co-op conversations were fun
[3:25:24] <%DatAsuna> It changed
[3:25:25] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1229464161366794241?s=19
[3:25:25] <gastherobots> Again, the combat is 𝘩𝘰𝘳𝘳𝘪𝘣𝘭𝘺 broken. As a solo player it really is all about the story as basically every encounter, even in flashpoints, are completely trivial.
[3:25:37] <siamzero94> and triggered the gas mine
[3:25:41] <%DatAsuna> I enjoy the combat well enough, as a pvp player.
[3:25:44] <%Superspider51> I made it through Knight and Inquisitor but I got bored when I tried smuggler and was locked out of a planet cause I didn't do enough side quests
[3:25:45] <leonsnixon> Saved
[3:26:00] <serpenttucker> Man this base is very farty
[3:26:02] <MattDemers> We are CONVERSING
[3:26:03] <Deadbulky> DESTORYED
[3:26:06] <%DatAsuna> I don't think you mean the combat is broken so much as the class tories are nerfed to shit
[3:26:15] <SeruraRenge> I'm biased because I play MMOs, hell I'm playing WoW Classic literally right now, but mmo-type combat has never bothered me
[3:26:18] <leonsnixon> He’s doing it
[3:26:24] <%krispen_wa> SWTOR is easy as fuck nowadays, but it's still full of padded trivial quests
[3:26:30] <+tearknack> mmo combat does bore me
[3:26:31] <%DatAsuna> SWTOR's combat is basically wow with less automation
[3:26:34] <+tearknack> @krispen_wa UGH
[3:26:47] <zocano> MMO combat is whatever, that’s not really what makes the class stories frustrating to enjoy
[3:26:47] <+Saanspoof> the problem with mmo's is its a hundred hours before you know if you like the combat or not
[3:26:51] <%DatAsuna> It's no FF14 MSQ
[3:26:54] <+Saanspoof> ff14 takes longer
[3:26:59] <Redblood801> More fart gas
[3:27:02] <+Saanspoof> but i do love ff14 fortunately
[3:27:09] <%DatAsuna> FF14 is way longer and way more trivial quest
[3:27:14] <SeruraRenge> FFXI is better
[3:27:19] <Pillagius> Imagine Bao-Dur rocket punch, Woolie?
[3:27:20] <+tearknack> @Saanspoof that's not true at all, i can learn that i dislike mmo combat really early
[3:27:20] <%DatAsuna> I also prefer FF11
[3:27:21] <+Saanspoof> Warrior of light please deliver my mail
[3:27:21] <%Irridium> FF14 requires you to group with people to continue the story which I really dislike
[3:27:25] <%krispen_wa> SWTOR's class stories are almost as padded as ARR.
[3:27:29] <DocMadfox> I try to enjoy FF14 but I can no
[3:27:33] <zocano> The class stories themselves are locked to the order set for each side, they cannot alter and change the world in any way, everything still has to be the static MMO world it’s made in
[3:27:39] <GarbageNirvana> Honk
[3:27:40] <+tearknack> is it normal mmo combat? then i 99% won't like it
[3:27:42] <DavianJ> FFXIV loves itself a pointless miniquest in the middle of the save the world quest that ends up with a fete being cutrscened for the next three hours
[3:27:44] <%DatAsuna> I wouldn't call the class stories padded so much as formulaic
[3:27:52] <leonsnixon> DOOT
[3:28:01] <notenoughgirls> does the status quo in swtor ever change at all? i cant imagine it does
[3:28:05] <+crimsonharvest> just totally murking it
[3:28:08] <%DatAsuna> There's always gonna be a 5 quest structure to each of the base planets and you can see the districts clealy divided
[3:28:10] <+ZoltanBMagnus> Droids aren't people so this is fine. This is the true light side
[3:28:17] <gastherobots> @krispen_wa It gets way way worse in the expansions. Fighting a boss for 15 minutes that poses no threat to you as you slowly take down his health is really fucking boring.
[3:28:21] <availablethor> Broken af
[3:28:30] <%DatAsuna> @notenoughgirls Yes things happen in the galaxy to change the state of affairs
[3:28:31] <leonsnixon> The music is popping off
[3:28:34] <GarbageNirvana> The Force doesn't know what droids are
[3:28:38] <gastherobots> Still love the game though so I mean.
[3:28:43] <SeruraRenge> @notenoughgirls It's wierd to explain because the Sith empire is perpetually on the cusp of losing to the republic
[3:28:48] <%RioGascar> the force is BZZZZZ
[3:28:53] <%OldManJEWc> I wish more games had group cutscenes like swtor. Like everyone has a chance for dialogue
[3:28:56] <%Irridium> Each expansion brings the general story forward
[3:28:58] <notenoughgirls> huh.
[3:28:59] <%DatAsuna> Some of them more significant than other but planets chnge allegiances, leaders die and politics change .etc
[3:29:13] <RrenKrieg> everyone learns shii-cho because that's literally basic arithmetic of lightsabers
[3:29:14] <zocano> @datasuna yep yep yep, seeing the same story structure and knowing the class story are basically not allowed to break it is terrible and makes for incredibly boring story progression and story telling
[3:29:21] <%Irridium> but it doesn't show it on the various planets so it doesn't really feel like it
[3:29:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> T-Minus 3:30 hours till R6 destroys Pat
[3:29:27] <SeruraRenge> the issue is the lore of the rest of the setting means eventually, the Sith HAVE TO lose
[3:29:33] <+awkwardl0ser> awkwardl0ser subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[3:29:43] <%DatAsuna> That said despite the formula, I still enjoy swtor and think the criticisms are hugely overblown
[3:29:46] <%krispen_wa> no it doesn't
[3:29:52] <%krispen_wa> sincr it's non-canon now
[3:29:53] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> It works on regular people. I used it alot earlh game
[3:29:55] <+Saanspoof> welcome awkwardcoolguy
[3:29:56] <damienlunas> Whirlwind is a big recommend
[3:30:02] <damienlunas> Whirlwind is the greatest
[3:30:11] <%krispen_wa> anything can happen now in SWTOR since nothing matters anymore
[3:30:19] <SeruraRenge> No one's ever really gone
[3:30:19] <%DatAsuna> @krispen_wa It still oeprates on legends rules, which still means the sith have to lose
[3:30:23] <+Saanspoof> I wish swtor kew that when it started
[3:30:24] <+taggerung403> whirlwind is breddy gud
[3:30:30] <damienlunas> Whirlwind also looks hilarious
[3:30:31] <Yaddabluh> lightning is still op even if youre "lightside"
[3:30:34] <%Superspider51> my biggest issue with SWTOR is they really fucked over Revan after kotor 1 and 2
[3:30:36] <+Saanspoof> and just went wild with its story
[3:30:48] <damienlunas> Shock is good too
[3:30:52] <%DatAsuna> That's everyone's biggest issue
[3:31:01] <%krispen_wa> I headcanon that my Jedi Knight is the Exile after being trapped like Revan was
[3:31:01] <zocano> Revan *and* Exile are big giant character assassinations
[3:31:05] <HideousDeity> She's literally dead center.
[3:31:10] <zocano> Exile gets it a thousand times worse
[3:31:14] <%DatAsuna> I never really hear a good reason why beyond "revan should be space goku with the biggest dick ever"
[3:31:16] <damienlunas> REAL FAKE DOORS
[3:31:24] <%krispen_wa> that's the only way i can stand the story
[3:31:26] <%Superspider51> pretty much all of kotor 1 and 2 gets shit on for Swtor
[3:31:27] <SeruraRenge> @Superspider51 The first time he came back it wasn't so bad because honestly he was trying to destroy the True Sith anyway so it makes sense he'd try to do it with Star Forge 2.0
[3:31:30] <+tearknack> i just don't want canon straight dad revan
[3:31:33] <+Estuko> PogChamp
[3:31:34] <SeruraRenge> the problem is when he came back again in the expansion
[3:31:42] <%awkwardl0ser> Remember when Forxe lightening didn’t suck?
[3:31:43] <%DatAsuna> Nah SWTOR definitely shits on kotor 2 but sucks off kotor 1
[3:31:54] <%Superspider51> the other issue is the Revan book
[3:31:57] <%DatAsuna> Partly cause karpyshyn wrote kotor 1 and bits of swtor
[3:32:00] <notenoughgirls> dont t3 and hk also get fucked over
[3:32:01] <leonsnixon> Pretty cool
[3:32:08] <%Superspider51> oh yeah they do
[3:32:09] <NoireRequiem> thursday night sith robes
[3:32:09] <%DatAsuna> And karpyshyn doesn't like avellone's stuff
[3:32:09] <+tearknack> tbf kotor 2 kind of shits on the rest of star wars
[3:32:12] <%Irridium> HK is a flashpoint midboss in TOR LUL
[3:32:14] <DocMadfox> @notenoughgirls T3 dies in the prequel book
[3:32:15] <%Superspider51> they turn HK into a mid raid boss
[3:32:15] <zocano> Ya no KotoR1 gets a ton of reverence in TOR
[3:32:15] <SeruraRenge> @notenoughgirls Which HK, there's 3 of them now
[3:32:15] <%DatAsuna> It's the Yakuza 2 situation
[3:32:17] <+Saanspoof> they were mad people liked kotor 2's writing
[3:32:19] <%OldManJEWc> We need a star wars themed Divinity: Original Sin 2
[3:32:20] <%Kalinflip> !uptime
[3:32:20] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 32 minutes
[3:32:23] <%krispen_wa> HK gets fucked over and then gets memed on by new HK units that are terrible
[3:32:23] <%DatAsuna> Kaoru is anothe writer's baby
[3:32:26] <+SarcFa> well Swtor and kotor 1 was bioware while kotor 2 was obsidian, so it makes sense bioware would go, we did better in their follow up game
[3:32:26] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:32:28] <%DatAsuna> so to america she goes
[3:32:38] <Ahk_90> Dressed for stat boost
[3:32:57] <+Saanspoof> "I just think the armband looks cool thats all"
[3:33:01] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Blood magic gives ya a defense bonus
[3:33:02] <%DatAsuna> And also yes
[3:33:15] <siamzero94> "But mom, that SS uniform gives me +5 to style"
[3:33:15] <%DatAsuna> Avellone literally said he wrote kotor 2 from a standpoint of hating star wars
[3:33:23] <%RioGascar> “It makes me look a space nazi...but it does give + 10 defense”
[3:33:32] <SeruraRenge> you have to keep in mind that each class was written by a different person so the views expressed in one story does not represent the views of everything
[3:33:33] <%DatAsuna> Eventually throughout the process he came back around to finding a love for it again.
[3:33:33] <+vaporousTippler> Mace Windu will remember that.
[3:33:40] <%JJCheeker> Luke skywalker wore a black suit
[3:33:43] <+skiassassin> Woolsworth: Combos of the old arcade
[3:33:45] <DocMadfox> I mean, Anakin wears blaaaaooooh.
[3:33:47] <%GeneralSCPatton> Light Side and Dark Side don't matter. FORCE IS FORCE *Mr. Incredible meme*
[3:33:48] <jorniev> is little v gonna pull a kreai at the end of this lp?
[3:33:50] <%DatAsuna> But he specifically said kreia exists to mouthpiece everything he hates about star wars.
[3:33:53] <SeruraRenge> @DatAsuna Ironically the thing that made him love Star Wars again was playing Kotor 1
[3:33:55] <%krispen_wa> considering how much I like KOTOR II I'm prettuy sure I actually hate Star Wars
[3:33:56] <+theAncopro> lol are you calling her the evil fat
[3:34:06] <+skiassassin> oh man the vibro blade
[3:34:07] <T_Sasquatch> Fat Evill
[3:34:10] <+skiassassin> vibrodong
[3:34:13] <%DatAsuna> I enjoy all 3
[3:34:25] <%DatAsuna> Kotor 1 definitely ha the nostalgia goggles for a lot of people tho
[3:34:26] <+Saanspoof> Original trilogy, kyle katarn, and kotor 1-2 are all you really need honestly
[3:34:30] <%DatAsuna> Even I did until the LP
[3:34:30] <+tearknack> @DatAsuna i mean, Kreia is a hyporctical racist so i've always foudn that statement kind of funny
[3:34:33] <Shyakuuu> Luke wore black, with channel boots and it looked fab
[3:34:43] <@Moobot> Type with normal letters, @gastherobots (warning)
[3:34:45] <zocano> KotoR2 is wonderful because it doesn’t approach star wars with intense reverence and is unafraid to critique a lot of its tropes
[3:34:45] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Avellone loves Star Wars. He wouldn't be able to write a good deconstruction of ut if hr didn't
[3:34:50] <%krispen_wa> I'm playing KOTOR I again and I actually think I hate that game
[3:34:51] <%DatAsuna> wow moobot
[3:34:51] <notenoughgirls> one of the visual guides i think talks about the council being "concerned" over anakin wearing black robes
[3:34:52] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> he*
[3:35:03] <%krispen_wa> mostlu because the dialogue options are garbage in KOTOR I
[3:35:03] <%RioGascar> i think star wars issue is...the main films dont want to delve into the deep shit. which allows for casuals to just get into it. but the nerds want the lore
[3:35:11] <%RioGascar> its the reverse issue comic books had
[3:35:17] <OBS_VinnieK> wooow moobot that was wow
[3:35:30] <SeruraRenge> if you take everything Kreia said at face value, you missed the entire point of her character and ignored that one of the key components of her character is she constantly lies and manipulates everyone, including the player
[3:35:31] <+Saanspoof> @RioGascar and with the new movies, they went into literally zero new ideas!
[3:35:35] <+tearknack> yeah sw isn't actually about deep lore shit or moral grey and what not
[3:35:44] <%RioGascar> of casuals would like iron man if they didnt have to read tons of comics and shit
[3:35:46] <+tearknack> it was a fun adventure movie
[3:35:50] <%DatAsuna> @SeruraRenge look forward to pat misattributing "apathy is death" on the podcast later
[3:35:51] <%awkwardl0ser> Is the the Steam virgin? The Steam Workshop mods for this are hemma S-Rank
[3:35:53] <%krispen_wa> Yeah Kreia is actually wrong a lot of the time
[3:36:01] <HideousDeity> Kreygasm
[3:36:07] <%krispen_wa> mostly because she's space Ayn Rand and no one likes Ayn Rand
[3:36:11] <+tearknack> ye
[3:36:14] <SeruraRenge> Did she ever ACTUALLY say Apathy is Death or do people just attribute that to her?
[3:36:15] <%RioGascar> But nerds want things explained and given reason to everything when sometimes the creators just dont care
[3:36:22] <leonsnixon> ABC
[3:36:23] <%DatAsuna> She never did
[3:36:24] <Pillagius> That's a high cast rate
[3:36:26] <%Taglog7> FBBlock MorphinTime
[3:36:29] <notenoughgirls> apathy is death is a real thing
[3:36:32] <+taggerung403> the apathy is death was a vision i think
[3:36:35] <KaseKaizer> monkaS
[3:36:38] <%krispen_wa> "She" said it
[3:36:38] <%DatAsuna> It's a real thing, just not a kreia thing
[3:36:41] <notenoughgirls> its in the cave tomb
[3:36:42] <%Taglog7> BOP
[3:36:42] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Race Traitor Drone LUL
[3:36:47] <%DatAsuna> But everyone misremembers it as a kreia thing
[3:37:04] <%DatAsuna> And pat 100% will too
[3:37:14] <notenoughgirls> it's said by a bunch of illusions
[3:37:15] <%RioGascar> Nah asuna
[3:37:23] <%RioGascar> Pat will just look at a wiki
[3:37:27] <+tearknack> i mean pat is 100% the type to take everything kreia says at face value
[3:37:29] <SeruraRenge> her whole point is "the jedi are hypocritical assholes and the sith are bloodthirsty morons" and the thing she refuses to let you point is "yeah and you're just like them bitch"
[3:37:34] <%RioGascar> and then take it as the best source
[3:37:38] <%DatAsuna> >assuming pat will properly read the wiki page
[3:37:45] <%JJCheeker> !uptime
[3:37:45] <damienlunas> Remote's official designation is UNKL T0-M
[3:37:45] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 37 minutes
[3:37:46] <rsg220> "so I read wookiepedia for the last week...."
[3:37:46] <indig0bird> Some of those are locked by level
[3:37:54] <%RioGascar> okay pat will have someone tell him
[3:37:55] <gastherobots> @krispen_wa Oh god you've just made me think of a KOTOR 2 based movie directed by Zack Snyder.
[3:38:03] <%krispen_wa> kreia is an amazing, complex character. she's also wrong. she's basically Pat
[3:38:11] <NoireRequiem> 21!
[3:38:18] <zocano> Kreia’s whole goal is to make her believe her point of view is the one to take
[3:38:19] <%DatAsuna> @krispen_wa You just know he'd play it and go "wow this is like the watchmen of star wars"
[3:38:25] <zocano> Most people fall for it
[3:38:28] <SeruraRenge> it's actually very easy to understand what Kreia actually wants. She wants you to be a sith, but not a retarded "kill everything for fun" sith
[3:38:50] <+RowenCleric> is Wools going strength or dexterity
[3:39:00] <+tearknack> neither, really
[3:39:00] <%RioGascar> i mean ya know sometimes people views are wrong, but they just so damn stuck on it that they’ll see it as right or whatever
[3:39:11] <+tearknack> he wants to do force powers this playthrough
[3:39:18] <zocano> There’s a reason you can’t side with her, though I’m surprised they never let you do it by the end
[3:39:18] <%DatAsuna> Also Kotor 2 is just tales of the abyss, prove me wrong
[3:39:19] <+RowenCleric> ah nice
[3:39:32] <NoireRequiem> time for breakdown! breakdown!
[3:39:32] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:39:32] <SeruraRenge> I mean, how much can you take seriously a person that fucked up on literally every student they ever trained?
[3:39:43] <zocano> I think it might be to drive home the point she *is* wrong
[3:39:45] <%Taglog7> Sue Down Sue Down
[3:39:46] <%DatAsuna> @zocano too spoilery
[3:39:46] <jorniev> WHENS PART 6
[3:39:51] <+MrRabbles> like yoda did
[3:40:17] <+RowenCleric> I feel like most jedi screwed up their students...
[3:40:21] <SeruraRenge> @MrRabbles Not true, Yoda trained Qwi-Gon and he was great. The issue is he died too early
[3:40:29] <%DatAsuna> If you type any sentence that involves "the end" of kotor 2, don't hit send
[3:40:31] <damienlunas> Kreia is the definition of /r/enlightenedcentrism
[3:40:33] <+tearknack> i thought dooku trained qui-gon?
[3:40:36] <+MrRabbles> Yoda stood by letting visions enable the clone wars
[3:40:43] <%krispen_wa> everyone was wrong, the only one right was HK-47. He's the only one who has his head on straight in KOTOR II
[3:40:43] <SeruraRenge> @tearknack Fuck he did
[3:40:50] <+dezimaly> I love that chats is having a talk about later game things so casually cause we all know they are reading chat
[3:40:52] <NoireRequiem> @RowenCleric tbh being a jedi or sith master seems like a raw deal
[3:41:02] <+dezimaly> arn't
[3:41:09] <+tearknack> luke was an okay teacher in legends
[3:41:09] <+RowenCleric> @NoireRequiem Grey Jedi for life
[3:41:14] <jorniev> yeah he is right lets change the subject
[3:41:15] <SeruraRenge> that's why it's the best place to discuss it
[3:41:18] <NoireRequiem> @RowenCleric amen
[3:41:19] <notenoughgirls> was goto wrong
[3:41:20] <+tearknack> he only had like, 1/100s of students turn evil
[3:41:28] <SeruraRenge> @tearknack You say that but i remember Kyp Durron
[3:41:33] <damienlunas> Jolee >>>>>> Kreia
[3:41:38] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @krispen_wa People don't like to admit it, but HK-47 truly did nothing wrong B)
[3:41:44] <%DatAsuna> The only "gray jedi" I like is the one V mentioned from swtor. He's just a drunk who uses mind tricks for free booze.
[3:41:48] <+MrRabbles> Kreia's reasoning isn't always wrong but the conclusions she reaches about how people should live is wrong
[3:41:49] <ScreamLord> @WoolieVersus There's an alternative to Lightsabers called a Broadsaber. Basically it's a Lightsaber with its blade flattened into an actual blade which gives it better cutting add piercing power and it's better at deflecting blaster bolts
[3:41:52] <+taggerung403> Kyp was a cool guy and didnt afraid of anything
[3:42:04] <ScreamLord> @WoolieVersus Unfortunately it's not very good at omnidirectional cutting like basic bitch Lightsabers are. So because it requires basic swordplay knowledge about Edge Alignment Jedi shit all over this over all superiorly designed weapon.
[3:42:12] <jorniev> is star wars good?
[3:42:13] <NoireRequiem> materia pockets?
[3:42:14] <%BallerSwagBro9k> POCKET? PogChamp
[3:42:15] <Madbearv> fill these pockets
[3:42:18] <%krispen_wa> Jolee is the only Grey Jedi that I like
[3:42:19] <%DatAsuna> yes star wars is good
[3:42:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WHAT A CHAD
[3:42:27] <SeruraRenge> I think the best way to sum up Kreia is "right for the wrong reasons"
[3:42:31] <jorniev> IS IT?
[3:42:31] <NoireRequiem> @jorniev definitely maybe
[3:42:31] <Reizie_Etherealm> LUL
[3:42:32] <siamzero94> @jorniev yes and no
[3:42:34] <%DatAsuna> Would you fuck bao dur?
[3:42:36] <Gutsandlove> LUL
[3:42:36] <deathsmions1> star wars is actually not good discuss
[3:42:37] <+tearknack> @SeruraRenge although thinking about it, if yoda was teaching people over the years than he probably had a punch of okay students
[3:42:38] <%DatAsuna> or would bao dur fuck you?
[3:42:41] <+tearknack> @DatAsuna yes
[3:42:51] <gastherobots> I'm interested in the "Jedi but not total fuckups" direction it sounds like they're going for in the High Republic.
[3:42:52] <Scrub_Seeker> @DatAsuna yes
[3:42:54] <%krispen_wa> Imagine the things Bao Dur could do with that arm
[3:42:58] <NoireRequiem> star wars kicked my dog, it is bad
[3:42:58] <+RowenCleric> bao dur is the best guy
[3:43:03] <%DatAsuna> I bet it vibrates
[3:43:11] <%DatAsuna> Soft surrender in this bitch
[3:43:15] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @DatAsuna U know it
[3:43:16] <Redblood801> @DatAsuna Only if he calls me General
[3:43:20] <+prime_name> Mark Ruffalo
[3:43:20] <+kyh9> Mark Ruffalo
[3:43:21] <Madbearv> mark ruffalo
[3:43:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Marc Ruffalo
[3:43:22] <jorniev> MARK
[3:43:23] <NoireRequiem> ruffalo
[3:43:24] <rsg220> Ruffles
[3:43:24] <SeruraRenge> I mean look at Bao-dur, she hates him because he went through struggle like she wants, but didn't come out stronger. So she only cares about getting the outcome she desires from it
[3:43:25] <Zebroneath> Chat, help
[3:43:26] <notenoughgirls> heh
[3:43:28] <+taggerung403> Rark Muffalo

[3:44:01] <CrabSlacks> he has a fist on his foot

[3:44:23] <notenoughgirls> PUNCH GLOVES
[3:44:23] <jorniev> i lost my shit
[3:44:23] <%Taglog7> "So your saying There's a chance."
[3:44:25] <%DatAsuna> Visas is goals
[3:44:26] <+Estuko> @DatAsuna yes please
[3:44:32] <%Taglog7> you're*
[3:44:42] <%DatAsuna> I aspire to be that level of goth gf
[3:44:42] <MidnightBurst12> Visas is life
[3:44:48] <+tearknack> I just like handmaiden cause she could beat me up irl
[3:44:50] <%RioGascar> I really dont like the idea of random loot drops on the whole game
[3:44:50] <%DatAsuna> "My life for yours"
[3:44:52] <+tearknack> i could beat up visas
[3:44:56] <+RowenCleric> Visas is truly goals
[3:44:59] <%RioGascar> or random loot in well all things
[3:45:01] <SeruraRenge> someone better post the REVAN UNDERSTOOD SNACKS image once Woolie has the full party
[3:45:01] <notenoughgirls> i love visas
[3:45:06] <+RowenCleric> party members in this game are so good
[3:45:07] <%Irridium> visas could beat up me
[3:45:08] <+tearknack> although i would love to BE visas
[3:45:12] <SeruraRenge> PRETZELS LIE, THEY MANIPULATE
[3:45:15] <zocano> Loot is a plague on game design
[3:45:28] <%krispen_wa> God, I love Kelly Hu's voice
[3:45:30] <+taggerung403> is visas or tali bigger waifu
[3:45:36] <+Estuko> @zocano I love loot, it's fun lol.
[3:45:41] <+Bluydee> I forgot how a significant portion of the game is spent as a cyborg ninja
[3:45:53] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @SeruraRenge But they're such delicious lies
[3:45:57] <%GeneralSCPatton> Does dropping a stat to 0 cause paralysis/unconsciousness/death as it does in D&D?
[3:46:13] <%BallerSwagBro9k> RIP
[3:46:13] <%krispen_wa> tali is bigger waifu because her hips are thicc
[3:46:15] <%DatAsuna> F
[3:46:20] <ScreamLord> Fann Y'pak looks like that Jedi in KOTOR 1 that gave 0 fucks about the universe but younger

[3:46:31] <+chiluzza> THE CLANKS GET THE GANK AT NIGHT
[3:46:32] <%DatAsuna> Look at this victim blaming
[3:46:33] <+taggerung403> @krispen_wa man of culture
[3:46:33] <SeruraRenge> @BallerSwagBro9k THEY TEMPT YOU WITH HUNGER, BUT BRING YOU THE SUFFERING OF THIRST.
[3:46:33] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[3:46:39] <bill_and_ted_dude> Strange Jedi in the alleyways
[3:46:41] <+Estuko> @krispen_wa but mysterious big tiddy goth gf though
[3:46:49] <zocano> Loot is the poison to good power/skill character progression
[3:46:54] <%DatAsuna> She ain't that big tiddy
[3:47:04] <%Irridium> visas is literally big tiddy goth gf
[3:47:04] <%DatAsuna> It's a hex maniac situation
[3:47:05] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @SeruraRenge
[3:47:06] <%krispen_wa> big tiddy goth with sexy voice but giant fucked up eye holes tho
[3:47:15] <tranquilturnips> Even with the restored content mod this area feels like it got heavy cuts
[3:47:15] <%Irridium> I can work with that
[3:47:18] <+Estuko> @DatAsuna That's a pretty big chest size if you're ignoring anime.
[3:47:18] <+RowenCleric> oh I didnt realize restoration mod affected this area
[3:47:20] <ScreamLord> Vibro Blades and Force Swords are so much cooler than basic bitch Lightsabers
[3:47:22] <%DatAsuna> Speaking of fucked up eye holes
[3:47:32] <+taggerung403> what about merrill vs tali
[3:47:34] <tranquilturnips> was he T posing
[3:47:36] <%DatAsuna> Probably my least favourite thing about this game is nihlus
[3:47:37] <siamzero94> Visas is more very form-fitting
[3:47:40] <%krispen_wa> Merril is garbage tier
[3:47:42] <CrabSlacks> ugh, this guy
[3:47:44] <Psyramics> no, he was stretching
[3:47:45] <%krispen_wa> absolutely an idiot
[3:47:50] <Pillagius> dorchuni subawatta?
[3:47:52] <Graywolf_the_45th> oh shit someone's here i better stop T-posing
[3:47:52] <tranquilturnips> @Psyramics ah I see
[3:47:53] <pleochronic> wow such luck, y'pakk actually looks fine

[3:49:16] <Redblood801> Watch it work for Woolie
[3:49:20] <zocano> My only main critique of this game is two fold: it’s a bit too white people (this is a larger star wars issue in general), and the ladies are a bit too on the waifu bait end
[3:49:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[3:49:27] <siamzero94> oh boy
[3:49:28] <Zohare> I don't think this guy is base game

[3:50:57] <gastherobots> @datasuna Most of the EU before KOTOR like the marvel comics with Luke using the force to crush an AT-AT with one hand did that. Nihlus was more a symptom of rather than a cause for the horrible power inconsistencies.

[3:56:35] <+kewlmyc> That's some petty shit
[3:56:35] <SeruraRenge> @Chatterbox1991 You say that but Rand was ok with charity, she just didn't like people being compelled to be charitable. If being good makes you feel good then Aryn Rand said have at it. Kreia's stance is "no, don't help others"

[4:03:48] <Holycow8498> Kojima has decent ideas some times but he needs to be told no Death Stranding was his George Lucas moment

[4:05:07] <NoireRequiem> @DatAsuna Bruh, not All Black Hks Kappa
[4:05:09] <GarbageNirvana> HK-47 is sitting there cooling on the windowsill

[4:05:12] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Arguably? Outright, I would say
[4:05:15] <%Superspider51> Droid planet is another mod I don't think Woolie installed it

[4:05:38] <jamesthebrave> My favourite KOTOR 1 peep was Jolee, but HK is great too. I always go light side though so he didn't like me lmao
[4:05:44] <NoireRequiem> @DatAsuna LUL
[4:05:48] <notenoughgirls> gaining enough influence with hk as a light side player to make his clouds blue is fucking hilarious

[4:10:28] <%MrMoonGoose> you want both. Poison and bleeding.
[4:10:28] <DocMadfox> It's good in some MMOs
[4:10:29] <+Shockrates20XX> Mostly the older ones.
[4:10:31] <jorniev> saryn fucks shit up
[4:10:37] <krlos970> AC Odyssey
[4:10:42] <%DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus It's hella worth it in SWTOR, but only because you can force the poison to tick faster using combos
[4:10:47] <ZeeJiggle> Dark Souls 2 normal poison is dangerous I remember.
[4:10:51] <GarbageNirvana> Saryn's good cause her shit stacks tho
[4:10:56] <+SolidusRex> Pokemon
[4:10:58] <+VHGS> poison whips fucking ass in Lightning Returns
[4:10:59] <GarbageNirvana> Like if you can stack poison it gets a lot better
[4:10:59] <LunarRemix> It's really good on Xenoblade Chronicles since it scales off from the hit that poisons it.
[4:11:00] <pleochronic> dark souls 2 poison was absurd
[4:11:01] <%DatAsuna> And yeah also cause it stacks
[4:11:03] <jorniev> like poison
[4:11:04] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[4:11:08] <Zebroneath> Sound logic
[4:11:09] <NoireRequiem> LUL
[4:11:10] <pleochronic> faster than toxic in other souls games
[4:11:14] <+Estuko> @jorniev that fucking spore spreading in survival is amazing lol.
[4:11:18] <%MrMoonGoose> KHAAAA
[4:11:25] <%DatAsuna> Virulence Sniper in swtor is all about stacking 3 poisons, buffing their ticks, THEN forcing them to tick 8 times per second

[4:12:20] <Pechugaman> If only Snake had space wizard powers
[4:12:22] <StarlitStunner> Droid Nothing
[4:12:29] <+taggerung403> ive never invested in destroy droid before and no i see the light
[4:12:31] <jorniev> metal gear would survive a jedi droid kill
[4:12:34] <%alpacasintophats> welp that metal gear got !CLAPPED!
[4:12:35] <SeruraRenge> actually it looks more like an AT-PT
[4:12:49] <%Superspider51> the one from Portable Ops about as big as a car
[4:12:52] <HappyCutePhoenix> this build is broken...
[4:12:55] <%GeneralSCPatton> AND THEN SAHELANTHROPUS!
[4:12:57] <%ChoculaUltra> I wholeheartedly believe any variation of Snake could kill a Jedi. Barehanded.
[4:13:20] <jorniev> revengeance is a more fun star wars game
[4:13:27] <rsg220> remember that 10 years before this, the mandalorians developed the sahelantrhropus droid in during the war
[4:13:35] <NoireRequiem> Snake would woo then neutralise any Jedi, non lethally somehow
[4:13:46] <MasterDecoder> Oh
[4:13:49] <CMDR_Scrappy> krea is the best puncher
[4:13:54] <CMDR_Scrappy> 1 hand punch 4Head

[4:14:02] <Heyestus> Ha Ha time for jilted albinos
[4:14:05] <+doc_ock_rokc> @NoireRequiem He would plug his controler into slot 2

[4:23:16] <%DatAsuna> Whoops, locked in
[4:23:20] <%gatorafan> @rowencleric, na'h I'm more like a way less succesful Pat. FeeslBadMan
[4:23:43] <%gatorafan> Can't even type daedra1CryingTibs
[4:23:51] <NoireRequiem> @caffienatedjedi I'd wager a good percentage of chat doesn't remember the 90s
[4:23:56] <Halospaz117> LIGHT SIDE SITH IS SO GOOD
[4:23:58] <%DatAsuna> It's greater goods
[4:23:59] <+SarcFa> YTou still heavy murder people
[4:24:01] <+chiluzza> instead of killing the slave it will works me
[4:24:05] <+SarcFa> just not as much
[4:24:11] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Dark Knight type
[4:24:12] <DocMadfox> LS Sitha re great
[4:24:43] <+taggerung403> Honorable warrior sith is great
[4:24:43] <gastherobots> DS Sith is chaotic stupid.
[4:24:43] <rsg220> Hey Woolie, remember hearing my mom watching you guys play games while I was still in the womb. I'm just starting middle school, keep up the good work!
[4:24:48] <Halospaz117> The best part is all the jedi who are so smug and supurior towards you and refuse to believe that you're a decent person, and you end up showing them up
[4:24:49] <serpenttucker> Renegade shepards in mass effect are fucking stupid
[4:25:01] <jorniev> I want a game that lets me play a guy like AMOS from EXPANSE
[4:25:03] <+zaibatsu_member_333> PoyosTakeNRG

[4:25:23] <+zaibatsu_member_333> Poyos TakeNRG
[4:25:30] <%DatAsuna> Real talk in all of mass effect
[4:25:40] <%DatAsuna> there are maybe 4 quarians that aren't jerks, in the whole species
[4:25:41] <%krispen_wa> some quarians need shep to put a baby in their tummy
[4:25:59] <+taggerung403> most quarians aside from the admirals were pretty chill
[4:26:09] <DocMadfox> Stasis is so OP in ME1

[4:27:08] <bear_breaker20> idk i think jacob taylor is best Kappa
[4:27:08] <+aishman> THAT THEY CHANGED IT
[4:27:08] <%awkwardl0ser> Speech/Charisma being worthless in Fallout 76 is what scared me away from the jump
[4:27:09] <jamesthebrave> That's the best way.
[4:27:09] <Warfey> wh
[4:27:11] <%krispen_wa> IT'S A STOCK PHOTO

[4:27:26] <+prime_name> It's edited Stock Art
[4:27:29] <Graywolf_the_45th> it's a stock photo they made purple
[4:27:29] <+kyh9> stock photo edited
[4:27:29] <+theAncopro> and it looks awful
[4:27:29] <+aishman> It's not romance, it's if she dies
[4:27:30] <bear_breaker20> it was a model
[4:27:31] <T_Sasquatch> It totally is an edited stock photo
[4:27:31] <Heyestus> it's a photoshop of a stock model @WoolieVersus
[4:27:33] <indig0bird> It's a stock photo photoshopped
[4:27:33] <Ahk_90> It was a stock photo tinted purple
[4:27:33] <+OmegaWeltall> naw it was a stock photo they photoshoped
[4:27:33] <NoireRequiem> she looks human, deadass
[4:27:35] <TigerClaws12> it's edited stock photo
[4:27:37] <+taggerung403> it was barely edited stock photo
[4:27:37] <%krispen_wa> it's edited stock photo
[4:27:39] <+SolidusRex> Stock photo
[4:27:40] <Sartastic> Shepard is best girl
[4:27:40] <bear_breaker20> not even fan art
[4:27:44] <DocMadfox> @Shyakuuu The ME3 MP scene is still alive on PC surprisingly
[4:27:45] <jamesthebrave> Either way, it's bad
[4:27:45] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus It was also not a romance, but if SHE DIED
[4:27:52] <%DatAsuna> Tali is snoke
[4:27:53] <+kyh9> its the ASS
[4:27:53] <+CelebrityGhost> a stock photo of an alien
[4:27:57] <rsg220> Nah but you can see the butt, thats all you need
[4:27:58] <serpenttucker> I still prefer Vetra > tali but I really like tali
[4:27:59] <+MrRabbles> but also that booty
[4:28:00] <jamesthebrave> I actually really enjoyed most of ME3 but there's a few bits in there that are really baffling
[4:28:02] <+VCRUZZO> we talking bout Kreia?
[4:28:06] <%krispen_wa> Is Doom Guy just hotter Tali?
[4:28:12] <+BionoidLCR> @serpenttucker jack all day
[4:28:12] <%DatAsuna> Vetra is bae, shame he ain't gay
[4:28:19] <%DatAsuna> *she
[4:28:22] <Shyakuuu> Not too surprising to me it was that good
[4:28:23] <+VCRUZZO> had to cause tv
[4:28:23] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YEP
[4:28:26] <jamesthebrave> Tali
[4:28:28] <indig0bird> But it was fun taking a peek at Pedro Pascal
[4:28:29] <Graywolf_the_45th> he always had a face
[4:28:31] <jorniev> NO WAY MAN
[4:28:32] <benjisonfire> dont think ive ever tuned into a woolie stream and actually seen him playing the advertised game lol
[4:28:36] <jamesthebrave> Tali's got the accent, it's unbeatable
[4:28:39] <nikoloas_> Doom guy has always had a face though
[4:28:44] <DocMadfox> Tali is a nerd who loves musicals. I fucking love her
[4:28:45] <gastherobots> You can't get much hotter than literally being in hell tho
[4:28:49] <jorniev> doom guy is hotter doom guy
[4:28:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Its bad but doesnt ruin her character
[4:28:51] <Psyramics> yuuup
[4:28:52] <Iniudan> Doom Guy always had a face, what to you think was in the middle at the bottom of the screen. =p
[4:28:53] <Enemy_In_Disguise> DOOMGUY always had a face
[4:28:55] <NoireRequiem> I guess Mando opening up to a robot was a statement about his growth to a lesser degree
[4:28:55] <Halospaz117> Congrats, that's ME3 as a whole pretty much
[4:28:55] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:28:56] <%ozzrabbit> I point to Master Chief.
[4:28:59] <%BallerSwagBro9k> TEAM TALI YEYEYEYE
[4:29:02] <%DatAsuna> It would be nice if the quarians weren't just israel/palestine
[4:29:02] <+katarjin> A lot of 3 is fine until the last bit
[4:29:06] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ME 2
[4:29:08] <NoireRequiem> Dredd Keeps the Helmet ON
[4:29:09] <%awkwardl0ser> They took a beautiful Israeli woman and gave her a Raven from Teen Titans filter
[4:29:13] <jorniev> oh god
[4:29:13] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus Reminder that Mass effect 3 had a new lead writer from 1 and 2 who left Bioware
[4:29:20] <mihokspawn> @ozzrabbit why do you point at poop?
[4:29:23] <+zaibatsu_member_333> KAPOW KAPOW
[4:29:23] <DocMadfox> I full on modded it out
[4:29:29] <+taggerung403> Just do all of ME3 and citadel and never do the final mission
[4:29:30] <jamesthebrave> Tali and Garrus were my squad for all 3 games, love those two
[4:29:31] <+aishman> And that's why things changed from Anti-matter to SINGULARITY
[4:29:32] <availablethor> It’s a stock photo but I think we all erased that from our minds. Just like. Bioshock 2, it just does not exist. ME3 is still an amazing game.
[4:29:38] <bear_breaker20> thats so nice of him to say about my wife
[4:29:47] <CrypticMochi> Some renegade options for certain characters suck major ass, they just become reskinned mobs
[4:29:47] <%BallerSwagBro9k> same
[4:29:49] <jamesthebrave> I was surprised how much I liked Vega in 3, considering he's the generic human for that game's squad
[4:29:53] <+MrRabbles> no full armor samus was already hot
[4:29:55] <+zaibatsu_member_333> Armored Samus is best
[4:29:56] <%DatAsuna> I preferred that orange sports top
[4:29:56] <%BallerSwagBro9k> and it sucks
[4:30:00] <rsg220> Samus is number one, voice by Jennifer Hale in Metroid Prime
[4:30:02] <TigerClaws12> LUL
[4:30:02] <GarbageNirvana> That's why I'm a Dark Samus fan now
[4:30:04] <NoireRequiem> "Nah gurl keep the armour on"
[4:30:06] <DocMadfox> So is armored Samus if you get good
[4:30:06] <%StaceMcGate> NOOOOO, is it over? I just got home
[4:30:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> OG Samus all the way
[4:30:11] <TedLives> im a femshep & liara stan. im sorry
[4:30:14] <serpenttucker> I still don't mind andromeda and 3. Not to say they are great games, but they have their charm to them that I can't ignore
[4:30:18] <theKingRamses> cowards don't go the 40k route and make battle armor
[4:30:20] <%DatAsuna> Lowkey her other M actress was fine, she just needed a better script
[4:30:22] <bill_and_ted_dude> Original Samus is able to step on a nail and not even notice, then they tore that down because sex appeal. Boo.
[4:30:23] <bear_breaker20> dicks in for armor
[4:30:25] <Valentinius_Anodyne> All of Samus' armors are so goddamn cool
[4:30:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @TedLives Strong ship as well
[4:30:28] <DocMadfox> Tali best girl
[4:30:30] <jorniev> ARE?
[4:30:36] <T_Sasquatch> Hell arkham nurse harley is great
[4:30:38] <%awkwardl0ser> I think more masked women should lean Gina Carano over like regular beautiful woman
[4:30:40] <jamesthebrave> The Samus Returns armor design was great
[4:30:43] <Shyakuuu> I support Armored Samus in smash at least
[4:30:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> OH NO
[4:30:49] <Dangerzone979> Andromeda was not nearly as bad as everyone says
[4:30:52] <bendatron> liara is cool but not as cool as tali
[4:30:52] <NoireRequiem> 13% of the galaxy eh Brudda?
[4:30:53] <%jiggy_snipe> sounds like you're justifying racism
[4:30:57] <Shyakuuu> Quik PogChamp
[4:30:58] <+Mendin> has woolie seen or commented on the project gg trailer yet because holy god we need to see his face live for that
[4:31:00] <%DatAsuna> Humans are absolutely the majority in star wars. There's human and EVERYTHING ELSE is "alien"
[4:31:00] <Belutima> let me tweet you a great Samus In armor cosplay anytime soon. doodGood
[4:31:02] <DocMadfox> There's thousands of planets full of humans
[4:31:02] <+BionoidLCR> @Dangerzone979 cmonBruh
[4:31:08] <xiccy> Miranda all day
[4:31:09] <indig0bird> Remember when someone on the forums analized how Tali's sweat would smell like and the writers just went "huh?"
[4:31:12] <jorniev> andromada was dog shit and it killed mass effect
[4:31:18] <iamyungdannow> Almost like... earth
[4:31:20] <+OneGorillionDollars> 666 MonkaS
[4:31:21] <gastherobots> Hey man remember the Sith? They were super evil! Who's to say these other frea- I mean, species, aren't evil just like them!
[4:31:21] <%jiggy_snipe> I mean apartheid South Africa tho
[4:31:21] <+zaibatsu_member_333> Krakoa!
[4:31:29] <+vaporousTippler> Advent Rising had issues, but humans being the galaxy's legendary mythical race was kinda neat.
[4:31:31] <+chiluzza> it follows House of M
[4:31:34] <NoireRequiem> The new X-men stuff ain't half bad
[4:31:43] <%Irridium> I played and beat Andromeda and it was a goddamn slog. Combat was solid but nowhere near good enough to carry the whole game.
[4:31:52] <DocMadfox> That's operative
[4:31:59] <+VCRUZZO> truw
[4:32:07] <+VCRUZZO> *true
[4:32:17] <%DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus It does with special items
[4:32:17] <+zaibatsu_member_333> made by the original X-man writer
[4:32:19] <Zebroneath> There's a lot more group encounters than solo encounters.
[4:32:20] <jamesthebrave> I've been playing Andromeda a bit recently. The gameplay is functional enough and I like the mobility options, but the writing is super dull
[4:32:27] <+katarjin> @Irridium excatly how I felt..never did finish
[4:32:28] <Shyakuuu> Gold Balls the mutant messiah lol
[4:32:32] <serpenttucker> Slay the spire does this.
[4:32:36] <GarbageNirvana> I keep wanting to try SWTOR but I don't trust EA to have not fucked it up somehow
[4:32:37] <jamesthebrave> I think that's the worst set of squadmates in any ME game
[4:32:45] <DocMadfox> Yet they FUCKING ARE GONNA NERD SORCERERS AGAIN, WHY?
[4:32:47] <%DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus SWTOR added a bunch of endgame items that turn single target things into AOE things like that
[4:33:07] <gastherobots> @GarbageNirvana I mean it's free and you don't even have to finish the whole download to try the starter planets for every class.
[4:33:08] <%StaceMcGate> guess its time to watch the vods
[4:33:09] <%awkwardl0ser> You think now is the time to make an none MMO console version of The Old Republic? PS5/XboxSX seems like a grape place to finally do it

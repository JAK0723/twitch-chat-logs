[0:06:26] <+MoroseLoki> bad lady
[0:06:39] <%heartlesshealer> I have a feeling Woolie will go for those whole 10 hours before dropping the game. Maybe
[0:06:54] <nicelastnamechoccy> I like this game
[0:06:55] <%wicketpelican> I think he will drop in a session, like, 8 hours.
[0:07:02] <%heartlesshealer> unless he's too far into shooter brain for turn brain
[0:07:27] <%wicketpelican> Oh man he is gonna botch tons of fights right? You need to keep track of so many status effects and the timeline.

[0:24:33] <dapperskeleton69> apple is the phone version of "oi ya got a loicense for that loicense?"
[0:25:03] <EternalJedi> apple phones aren't worth the cost for their specs, even not bleeding edge
[0:25:16] <%Superbro64> didn't apple kill all 32 bit applications and games?
[0:25:20] <%emperordread> everything apple is absolute garbage
[0:25:23] <%Javaa01> Everything you do on an Apple device is done on Apple's terms, and they are not afraid to screw you if you try to act smart
[0:25:39] <%heartlesshealer> I don't know, but at least they failed in killing all Unreal Engine games
[0:25:46] <%Wool> rip phone
[0:25:55] <dapperskeleton69> every time apple fans rejoice bc apple implemented the most basic of features from android, i chuckle
[0:26:16] <%Superbro64> I find it funny how Pat and Woolie's talks on Apple v. Epic was -completely- removed from their opinions on the IOS system itself
[0:26:28] <%Irridium> all the fucking rich kids at my school had the razr. I'm sure it was a good phone but I just can't separate the two at this point.

[0:34:43] <%unclekulikov> the music is AWESOME
[0:34:45] <%ironohki> I dove in the other day it is super good.
[0:34:45] <%RyTYoung> It looks so cool
[0:34:49] <+Pyroclase> Is the soundtrak in BPM actually just stock music or is some of it original?
[0:34:54] <%Solidnick18> over a metal soundtrack
[0:34:57] <Aussie_Manny> Yo, that sounds like some Baby Driver shit! PogChamp
[0:35:01] <+balouie> controller works
[0:35:01] <Parapattern> If you somehow threw Tetris into BPM, you'd have the perfect Woolie game
[0:35:04] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> better play BPM with some hatsune miku fam
[0:35:07] <RealPT1> where'd beyond the grave go?
[0:35:09] <%RyTYoung> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[0:35:11] <%Reverend_Roscoe> what was the one that is similar to BPM?
[0:35:11] <%Solidnick18> oh boy
[0:35:11] <%Javaa01> Everything except basic WASD movement and your initial jump has to be done on the beat
[0:35:15] <%Solidnick18> cube boys

[0:37:23] <%heartlesshealer> blood battle
[0:37:25] <RaidenRising> is this animu
[0:37:31] <Aussie_Manny> That was solid.
[0:37:31] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> well that was a nice opening
[0:37:33] <OneThousandTomatoes> kool
[0:37:36] <%Vigonept> battle of blood
[0:37:39] <LeeOhX> YO
[0:37:39] <Ashenik1> The lady singni gives me witcher 1 vibes
[0:37:39] <%Malik1002> damn i would watch that anime
[0:37:39] <+JustToWatch> that was rad
[0:37:40] <Aussie_Manny> NOT Montreal?!!
[0:37:41] <LeeOhX> ONTARIO
[0:37:41] <+DukeMoose> raw fury! they good
[0:37:45] <+Bluemanzee> Obi Wan on the left
[0:37:47] <%RyTYoung> Canuck made
[0:37:48] <BlackermanZX> TALK NO JUTSU
[0:37:50] <%Solidnick18> those ontario lords
[0:37:52] <+Veraverse> He did it! He pressed the button
[0:38:00] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Futurecity10
[0:38:01] <%a_goth_pancake> sbfpSetIn
[0:38:05] <Aussie_Manny> No subtitles?!
[0:38:06] <%heartlesshealer> text game, subtitles default
[0:38:08] <Aussie_Manny> No dialogue?
[0:38:09] <Afterman_> it has text always
[0:38:10] <SilverSnake55> Turn on V sync so there's no accidental tearing to fuck up the sprites
[0:38:10] <Futurecity10> All my homies hate ontario
[0:38:16] <Aussie_Manny> Ohhh, Subs default. Good.
[0:38:26] <%artificerjoni> Cool Intro. What platforms is this on?
[0:38:26] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:38:37] <%heartlesshealer> it's on Steam for sure, not sure what else
[0:38:54] <NiktenKing> Pretty sure everything current gen
[0:38:58] <+Pyroclase> It's really weird that the armor and designs are *less* detailed in the animated intro
[0:39:01] <%mitchteck> Also on game pass
[0:39:04] <Aussie_Manny> 1st run. GO!
[0:39:10] <NiktenKing> Its on Switch... so there's that
[0:39:11] <+tehbeardedbard> 420 viewer i get to quit twitch
[0:39:22] <LeeOhX> first run best run calling it now
[0:39:24] <%RyTYoung> PogChamp
[0:39:26] <OToole42> Very much like Octopath Traveller
[0:39:27] <OneThousandTomatoes> wow
[0:39:29] <+Fattness132> 3d pixel style. thats cool
[0:39:29] <Aussie_Manny> Ah, there's the dialogue.
[0:39:31] <%Solidnick18> yooooo
[0:39:33] <%pectusumbra> @Pyroclase it's common for animation to have less details to be easier to animate
[0:39:36] <LeeOhX> oh shit this is not whatt I expected
[0:39:41] <+Razputin217> Rougelike or rouge-lite?
[0:39:41] <%Akizea> ayyyy Davion is my name
[0:39:45] <%a_goth_pancake> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[0:39:45] <%Akizea> weird to see my name in games tbh
[0:39:51] <jorniev> oh this is the one with the corgi
[0:39:52] <Aussie_Manny> ZUB ZUB CRUD LUL
[0:39:55] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that's VERY pretty. Octopath also did lighting on pixels and that looked great as well
[0:40:08] <%artificerjoni> @heartlesshealer @niktenking Thanks, I'm a PC and Nintendo guy.
[0:40:25] <RaidenRising> your mc is smoll
[0:40:34] <%a_goth_pancake> this looks gorgeous
[0:40:41] <%heartlesshealer> you're welcome
[0:40:51] <+DukeMoose> maybe they have jetpacks
[0:41:15] <Make_me_mad> Check out the in-battle backgrounds in this game too. They're gorgeous and the perspective shifting on them as turns change is really cool.
[0:41:18] <OneThousandTomatoes> jetpacks might be worth it
[0:41:28] <%heartlesshealer> I like how the overworld controls pop up at the bottom
[0:41:38] <%a_goth_pancake> zooooooom
[0:41:44] <+DukeMoose> the wreckage is a new playground
[0:41:49] <Aussie_Manny> D:
[0:41:54] <Aussie_Manny> STONE COLD!
[0:42:21] <+Regigangster> :( Enemy has low self esteem
[0:42:26] <LeeOhX> yeha oka this is dope
[0:42:38] <Make_me_mad> This combat system is really rad.
[0:42:42] <Parapattern> What would Woolie betray humanity for sooner: a jet pack or an exo-suit?
[0:42:49] <RaidenRising> jetpack
[0:42:51] <+Razputin217> Grandia?
[0:42:52] <NiktenKing> I wish Golden Sun made a return with this kinda sprite work and lighting. Actually pretty much and GBA era RPG honestly
[0:42:52] <assfordayz> Jets
[0:42:57] <+Regigangster> These pixel graphics are a bigger flex than all of The Thousand Year Door
[0:43:00] <%heartlesshealer> close to Grandia yeah
[0:43:03] <assfordayz> But what if a human gives him a jetpack?
[0:43:16] <Aussie_Manny> @NiktenKing Nintendo: "That's a good idea, so no."
[0:43:24] <%king_wragles> king_wragles subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months! 
[0:44:12] <assfordayz> *Gets shoot on the face, dies*
[0:44:30] <Aussie_Manny> 1st run scuffed. gg. Kappa
[0:44:34] <assfordayz> "Ow! I should have used armor on my head too"
[0:44:36] <%a_goth_pancake> who the fuck at Nintendo thought it would be a good idea to push the artificial scarcity on Mario allstars?
[0:44:52] <lotharrio> Oh man, that's an easy way to crit.
[0:44:56] <+Ricochet_Frame> Bullets Per Minute is a pretty bad ass game! ive completed a run with each of the characters and it has a lotta promise overall. I'm hoping they release more content for it down the road.
[0:45:00] <NiktenKing> @aussie Nintendo doesn't own Camelot tho
[0:45:07] <+b_aleph> @a_goth_pancake Gene Parmesan
[0:45:20] <Aussie_Manny> Yes, but the Edge of Tomorrow armour is SICK. HahaThink
[0:45:21] <+RowenCleric> @a_goth_pancake my uncle who works at Nintendo... Im sorry Im so ashamed
[0:45:25] <%heartlesshealer> Nocturne feelings
[0:45:26] <%Vigonept> don't let them have a turn
[0:45:27] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1305742410211876864?s=19
[0:45:32] <dapperskeleton69> yo this music sounds like a techno mix of doom e1m1
[0:45:48] <%a_goth_pancake> @rowencleric you should be, give him a swift kick in the nuts at the next family get together
[0:45:52] <Aussie_Manny> Armour break?
[0:45:59] <+gitgouda> do the magic trick where you turn your enemy into a corpse
[0:46:01] <%FuqBoiSlim> pogg
[0:46:10] <lotharrio> Doesn't that mean that speed is always the right path to take?
[0:46:16] <Aussie_Manny> Well, I'm kinda glad it's not Active Battle System. You can take your time.
[0:46:32] <%artificerjoni> @dapperskeleton69 It kind of does. Huh. woolieSPICE woolieGASM
[0:46:46] <%KilljoyHexx> Ohh very othercide like
[0:46:52] <heartlesshealer> Each diamond on the timeline is 10 seconds
[0:47:07] <dapperskeleton69> @lotharrio looks like speed isnt always the answer
[0:47:21] <popcultureaficionado> this game is cool
[0:47:27] <Aussie_Manny> Into the next ROUND?
[0:47:43] <dapperskeleton69> yo is this game do combo then?
[0:47:45] <jorniev> BREAK
[0:47:46] <Aussie_Manny> Ohhh, I see.
[0:47:55] <+Regigangster> Wow literally beating somebody into next Tuesday
[0:47:57] <%Vigonept> oh no is delay gonna be strong as shit like in trails?
[0:47:57] <Aussie_Manny> Yeah, I think so Do combo.
[0:48:01] <KaiserMario> Hey does anyone here knows if the Roosteeth stream was archived? I checked it today but couldn't find it anywhere...
[0:48:15] <Aussie_Manny> Hew
[0:48:22] <%Vigonept> check the rooster terth website
[0:48:26] <EternalJedi> uhhhh
[0:48:30] <KaiserMario> I said I just did
[0:48:36] <+jiggy_snipe> might be ps2
[0:48:39] <EternalJedi> I don't think I've ever seen a "knock them down the timeline" system before
[0:48:56] <%cabooseteamkill> grandia was a bit similar
[0:48:58] <%KilljoyHexx> @EternalJedi othercide has it too
[0:49:02] <%artificerjoni> Didn't RoosterTeeth start an Archive purge?
[0:49:02] <%SilverRoddo> Infinity train?
[0:49:06] <dapperskeleton69> @kaisermario might not be archived so they can upload to youtube or smthn, earn extra bucks off of the recording
[0:49:06] <jorniev> was smt like that?
[0:49:15] <Aussie_Manny> I think Child of Light did something similar, if you hit an enemy , their turn comes later? I forget thuogh.
[0:49:31] <OToole42> octopath too
[0:49:32] <iambqb> The only real complaint I've had from playing this game is how long a run can be before you fail and restart
[0:49:42] <+Posh_Cat> Posh_Cat subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! ellaLOVE
[0:49:43] <Aussie_Manny> gg
[0:50:00] <KaiserMario> @dapperskeleton69 Ok, I'll check again later, Woolie mentioned he would receive a link from them, but I'm guessing he never did
[0:50:01] <%heartlesshealer> SMT was like that since Nocturne, except it was earning extra half-turns/actions instead of fully delay on the timeline.
[0:50:05] <%Javaa01> Also, needing to think about actions multiple turn phases in advance is very Frozen Synapse, where each turn phase is 5 seconds in real time
[0:50:32] <%Javaa01> So moving across the map can take multiple turns
[0:51:04] <Aussie_Manny> Titan Hand 2 when?
[0:51:06] <lotharrio> Buried giant robot?
[0:51:16] <TBFeric> this overworlds cute af
[0:51:22] <%Solidnick18> huh
[0:51:23] <NiktenKing> Octopath Traveler had the whole leg debilitation debuff that made your enemy start only on the next turn, but was limited to a few debuff abilities on certain classes
[0:51:32] <Aussie_Manny> Oooh, it's Blaze from Starcraft! :O
[0:51:35] <%Solidnick18> firewulf
[0:51:45] <KaiserMario> @dapperskeleton69 What's 'smthn'?
[0:51:50] <%Solidnick18> that's a cool design
[0:51:51] <+Regigangster> 40k dreadnought?
[0:51:57] <Aussie_Manny> AAAH
[0:51:59] <+Pyroclase> That looks SO GOOOOD
[0:52:02] <Aussie_Manny> THIS RUN IS FUCKED D:
[0:52:42] <dapperskeleton69> @kaisermario something
[0:52:42] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:52:52] <Aussie_Manny> Grass, Fire, Water, Electric...
[0:52:52] <%heartlesshealer> These are your elements
[0:53:11] <%heartlesshealer> Attack types are under your Power names
[0:53:33] <Afterman_> blue is armor
[0:53:37] <reonome> shields
[0:53:44] <Make_me_mad> Yellow is armor. Blue is shields.
[0:53:49] <Make_me_mad> Pink is HP.
[0:53:51] <Afterman_> yea shields i mean
[0:54:01] <Aussie_Manny> Why isn't HP green? D:
[0:54:11] <Afterman_> pink is abetter color than gren
[0:54:12] <Afterman_> green
[0:54:20] <Aussie_Manny> not in this stream, heathen
[0:54:25] <Aussie_Manny> Kappa
[0:54:44] <reonome> SMIRK
[0:55:12] <+zero_jacks> smirking
[0:55:18] <BoneBagMel> why this game look so fucking good
[0:55:38] <Aussie_Manny> the sprite work is so fuckin' good
[0:55:47] <+Estuko> That's very similar to dissidia rules on that break mechanic, setting them back a turn on Break
[0:55:51] <Aussie_Manny> this'd be solid on the Switch
[0:55:54] <%Javaa01> 20 seconds is the pushback
[0:56:01] <Aussie_Manny> BREAK!
[0:56:37] <BoneBagMel> wow
[0:56:39] <Aussie_Manny> FWOOM! CurseLit
[0:56:47] <BoneBagMel> that was really strong
[0:56:49] <BoneBagMel> like, visually
[0:57:13] <Aussie_Manny> M A T H S
[0:57:21] <%heartlesshealer> =)
[0:57:22] <%Solidnick18> numbers monkaS
[0:57:22] <$JobbedBone> COLORS
[0:57:26] <Aussie_Manny> I'd just hit the thing. thebkSip
[0:57:29] <Hammatime8> Math! MATH!
[0:57:32] <BoneBagMel> No I don't want to do math
[0:57:33] <NiktenKing> Maffs
[0:57:36] <BoneBagMel> Immout
[0:57:38] <OToole42> so shield tsakes damage, armor takes damae, then health
[0:57:38] <%heartlesshealer> 48 + 8 = 56
[0:57:39] <%Solidnick18> do the thing
[0:57:45] <Aussie_Manny> Why would they change math? MATH IS MATH! ashewyPUFF
[0:57:56] <$JobbedBone> How long is a second though? 🤔
[0:57:56] <OToole42> my god this keyboard
[0:58:06] <reonome> this is a weird system
[0:58:10] <Make_me_mad> Shield is a buffer that protects EVERYTHING else. Anything that goes through shields hits Armor and HP, but you have to get above the armor number to actually hit HP.
[0:58:10] <%Javaa01> No, the armor doesn't get cracked
[0:58:19] <+Ricochet_Frame> its all good fuck the shield then fuck the armor then fuck up his day lol
[0:58:28] <Make_me_mad> Shield is just a buffer over everything else. Armor is persistent damage protection until you break it.
[0:58:28] <+Regigangster> Warframe
[0:58:35] <Aussie_Manny> Shield as extra HP, and individual Armour points.
[0:58:36] <reonome> armor is just defense
[0:58:38] <jorniev> mass effect
[0:58:38] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> It all makes more sense once you go through a couple battles
[0:58:56] <+Ricochet_Frame> slay the spire has the same combat set up
[0:58:57] <lotharrio> Shield is extra HP, armor is damage reduction on health damage.
[0:59:03] <%heartlesshealer> If: DAMAGE - (ARMOR) > SHIELDS, Then: Apply remainder to HEALTH
[0:59:08] <%Javaa01> But yeah this is just the Warframe health system
[0:59:18] <%Javaa01> With not as absurd numbers
[1:00:14] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Are you insinuating that Inaros Prime has absurd health?
[1:00:14] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:00:41] <$JobbedBone> so a second is each of those pips at the top?
[1:00:53] <OToole42> each pip is 10 seconds
[1:00:59] <$JobbedBone> oh
[1:01:00] <%heartlesshealer> 10 seconds is each pip
[1:01:02] <OToole42> as is the end of the bar
[1:01:07] <%heartlesshealer> yeah what OToole42 said
[1:01:08] <%Solidnick18> ok
[1:01:24] <OToole42> what heartlesshealer said
[1:01:59] <Make_me_mad> Woolie there's a flashing pink health bar RIGHT THERE
[1:02:11] <OToole42> hp bar flashes to shoe expected damage
[1:02:15] <californaya> it is kinda hard to see it, the enemy is also pink
[1:02:16] <OToole42> show*
[1:02:37] <%heartlesshealer> not the best enemy to look at the enemy health bar for the first time
[1:02:40] <OToole42> wonder if theres a coulour blind mode, can barely see half the effects
[1:02:45] <%cache_22> The pink UI elements could use a drop shadow or something I think.
[1:03:02] <+Pyroclase> I dunno what a flux war is but it sounds sick
[1:03:04] <$JobbedBone> depth of field + pixelart looks so strange to me

[1:04:35] <%heartlesshealer> Exosuit Siblings
[1:04:59] <%YakumoYomi> That's a huge bitch!
[1:05:46] <californaya> just make sure that shit happens immediately, as opposed to after their turn
[1:05:46] <lotharrio> It's projecting on neutral.
[1:05:58] <+deviljhojho_> show em who is boss
[1:06:11] <OToole42> killshot is guaranteed 95% of the time
[1:06:34] <+fizzguy47> you can rely on it, as long as you make sure variables do not change
[1:07:00] <EternalJedi> bypass is a seperate thing, the shatter icon indicates how much armor it'll STRIP
[1:07:01] <%Javaa01> The shatter icon means it will break that number of armor points for further attacks
[1:07:02] <rbakervv> that's armor damage
[1:07:20] <nintega010> @WoolieVersus Holy crap when you said "here's Davion" you freaked me out cause that's my name spelled exactly like that. :D

[1:07:51] <+Pyroclase> that synth music <3 <3
[1:08:13] <%Peyote_> this game looks sick
[1:08:48] <%Javaa01> Time to learn about IPS
[1:08:51] <Make_me_mad> This game IS sick. Woolie's getting kind of overwhelmed right now though.
[1:08:58] <EternalJedi> thre's a frontload, but it's really not that complex once you get going
[1:09:55] <%a_goth_pancake> anybody else hearing Doom e1m1 in this battle theme or am I going crazy?
[1:10:16] <nintega010> God that's so weird hearing them say my name.
[1:10:41] <%YakumoYomi> @a_goth_pancake It's not just you. I definitely hear it.
[1:10:58] <Make_me_mad> You can cancel actions with mouse and keyboard for sure.
[1:11:08] <Make_me_mad> Probably a way to cancel it on controller, too.
[1:11:10] <lotharrio> What about just "B"
[1:11:12] <%Tearonex> @inspect units and then cancel action
[1:11:24] <Rusflex> i think it's RT
[1:11:45] <%Tearonex> @woolieversus inspect units then cancel action over the unit
[1:11:54] <$JobbedBone> moving camera messing with selection LUL

[1:12:32] <Make_me_mad> The moving camera is so cool though! Look at the background shift!
[1:12:34] <+balouie> I know I feel stupid now
[1:12:45] <%Javaa01> The damage on the light attack will be resisted, but the pushback will not be

[1:15:56] <Make_me_mad> Combo = Combination, as in between two characters. That's why it and Flurry are separate categories.

[1:47:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> I LOVE HIM
[1:47:38] <+Bluemanzee> Woolie gave him a Zapp Brannigan voice
[1:47:38] <%Heavensguard92> Saboteur best class
[1:47:41] <Ashenik1> Woolie sounds like Zapp Branningan LUL
[1:47:47] <spardanwarrior> Funda-metalists is strong
[1:47:57] <alphalejandro> Parker almost saves the universe but quill made it personal and doom us everyone
[1:47:59] <EternalJedi> you CAN rename characters, if you want
[1:48:09] <NiktenKing> Keep doing Zapp
[1:48:11] <%Solidnick18> potato
[1:48:14] <Ashenik1> @Bluemanzee I see a man o culture
[1:48:19] <Teyaric> 5 and an escort later in the game.
[1:48:55] <+zero_jacks> Aye YO
[1:49:03] <+fizzguy47> you can look at the map if you want to plan out your route
[1:49:05] <%Tearonex> Zappbranagen (probs didn’t spell it righ)
[1:49:05] <+Bluemanzee> I love that
[1:49:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> so in this game are multiple runs with new people each time?
[1:49:09] <%pectusumbra> this game has plenty of references in it
[1:49:10] <+zero_jacks> that album is killer
[1:49:20] <%heartlesshealer> right stick
[1:49:26] <Teyaric> You have exited the serious plot part of the game. It's all goofy Whedonesque zingers from here on out.
[1:49:29] <TigerClaws12> right stick
[1:49:42] <$JobbedBone> Wait no it was Atton that plays pazaak in his head
[1:49:44] <TigerClaws12> oh
[1:50:07] <+fizzguy47> @teyaric I wish it were more Hades than Whedon
[1:50:07] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts

[1:50:45] <%a_goth_pancake> kenemancy? like "kenetic-mancy"?
[1:50:46] <Teyaric> He's got stuns. And stuns. And stuns.
[1:50:52] <+Pyroclase> Teleportation is a SKILL here?
[1:50:54] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[1:51:01] <dapperskeleton69> nodo sold fake n-word passes
[1:51:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Pyroclase ye man just teleport 4head
[1:51:40] <+fizzguy47> Survey Corp
[1:52:02] <+Bluemanzee> Avoiding being killed is a good overall goal
[1:52:08] <%Heavensguard92> Totally legit n passes._. Just expired
[1:52:17] <OToole42> bestow shields heals allies shield bar
[1:52:20] <lotharrio> Oh that's such a solid stun.
[1:52:26] <%heartlesshealer> Party members seem to always come in at Level 1, just a note
[1:52:30] <%pectusumbra> that's a camp skill
[1:52:31] <Teyaric> Cards are CAMPING SKILLS.
[1:52:50] <OToole42> cards are used in camp, they build friendship meter and give buffs
[1:53:04] <$JobbedBone> oh no they used the cool spelling D:
[1:53:05] <+fizzguy47> No timer powers mean they execute instantly, no cancels
[1:54:03] <lotharrio> Blitz looks so damn strong.
[1:54:05] <%heartlesshealer> No timer = instant
[1:55:04] <%Heavensguard92> Level that Saboteur up
[1:55:07] <%Solidnick18> cool
[1:55:15] <%heartlesshealer> pie chart in the corner of a power's panel is the timer
[1:55:24] <alphalejandro> rpg trope
[1:55:33] <%pectusumbra> Lost your bro so no dual techs
[1:55:48] <%pectusumbra> wait that other was a kill shot wasn't it?
[1:55:54] <%heartlesshealer> on the mark is on second 60
[1:56:18] <OToole42> but your buddy hits and crits
[1:56:39] <Teyaric> Now the downside of Breaking - they get moved to early in the next turn.
[1:57:04] <%Heavensguard92> Did just pass up a kill
[1:57:23] <Teyaric> In order to /get/ critted, yeah.
[1:57:23] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:57:23] <%heartlesshealer> Yeah, and then that's where the green number comes in, knowing how far past the 60 mark they got pushed tells you when the enemies will do things next turn
[1:57:38] <+fizzguy47> @teyaric Sometimes you'd rather just shield tank instead of staggering
[1:57:40] <%heartlesshealer> love it
[1:58:03] <+fizzguy47> Oof
[1:59:16] <Make_me_mad> He's critting you, Woolie.
[1:59:19] <Teyaric> Caus you're gonna /get/ crit
[1:59:24] <OToole42> he crits you first
[1:59:29] <OToole42> before you hit him
[1:59:44] <%Solidnick18> oooh
[1:59:45] <OToole42> if an enemy goes first they crit you, if you go first you crit them
[2:00:04] <%heartlesshealer> ooooh Reggie with foresight
[2:00:05] <Make_me_mad> Shields fully recharge at the end of combat.
[2:00:15] <%heartlesshealer> they do?
[2:00:24] <%Solidnick18> maybe before he attacks
[2:00:26] <OToole42> shields heal, hp and armor do not
[2:00:27] <Make_me_mad> Armor and Health damage is persistent.
[2:00:33] <Make_me_mad> Shields recharge.
[2:00:39] <OToole42> only healed by pickups
[2:00:47] <NiktenKing> It also reduces defense
[2:00:47] <%heartlesshealer> okay, I was mixing armor and shields in my head. Sorry about that
[2:00:47] <OToole42> and some abilities
[2:01:13] <+fizzguy47> you just wait
[2:01:13] <OToole42> DNA is your exp
[2:01:16] <%Solidnick18> niceeee
[2:01:22] <OToole42> so you choose level ups
[2:01:26] <+Pyroclase> oh that's healthy
[2:01:30] <NiktenKing> Edge

[2:03:10] <OToole42> you can level up during, DNA is spent like souls in Dark soulds
[2:03:16] <Make_me_mad> Woolie continues to read 6 as 8 every time he sees it.
[2:03:41] <%pectusumbra> The Gurren Mk.II
[2:03:41] <+fizzguy47> yeah, smear that DNA all over me
[2:04:06] <NiktenKing> LUL
[2:04:15] <alphalejandro> Reggie: I see like an eagle
[2:04:24] <%DappercatEsquire> i heard woolie has really good vision
[2:04:24] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:04:45] <+fizzguy47> it's fine
[2:06:11] <SirMcSlushy> Im confused how the far at the top works, why does the smaller number on the green clock more them farther to the right.
[2:06:14] <SirMcSlushy> bar*
[2:07:08] <+fizzguy47> @sirmcslushy the clock shows how fast the attack comes out
[2:07:11] <+AsinPersuasion> is this the default party? i saw pat use the exact same guys
[2:07:21] <Make_me_mad> This is your starting 3, yeah.
[2:07:25] <%pectusumbra> I think it might be a first world thing
[2:07:45] <OToole42> @SirGO0SE each white pip is 10 seconds, the more time, the more your attack delays the enemy turn
[2:07:52] <OToole42> whoops
[2:07:56] <OToole42> @SirMcSlushy
[2:08:02] <SirMcSlushy> I think im seeing it.
[2:08:15] <%pectusumbra> I feel like it might still be better to just delete enemies when you can
[2:08:23] <+fizzguy47> @sirmcslushy the crit bonus shows how much they are delayed if you crit
[2:08:47] <OToole42> theres 0 misses
[2:08:58] <%SirGO0SE> made me double take tho @OToole42 LUL
[2:08:59] <%wicketpelican> Attacks never miss.
[2:09:11] <OToole42> @SirGO0SE too many sirs Ha
[2:09:18] <%SirGO0SE> its a good sign ;)
[2:09:18] <%Heavensguard92> One less enemy is always agood option
[2:09:26] <OToole42> True that
[2:09:38] <+AsinPersuasion> death is the best damage mitigation
[2:09:52] <%pectusumbra> Inspiration, and improvement!
[2:10:03] <lotharrio> The best defense is killing that motherfucker when he looks at you.
[2:10:24] <%pectusumbra> front and backline like your party I imagine
[2:10:55] <+fizzguy47> that tooltip is bugged in combat
[2:11:04] <+AsinPersuasion> stuns on crit no?
[2:11:06] <%Heavensguard92> Never really used titans blessing myself
[2:11:12] <+fizzguy47> it doesn't show the increased damage
[2:12:02] <%Heavensguard92> Every ability for saboteur is so useful
[2:12:02] <+AsinPersuasion> battle cry from samurai champloo?

[2:13:51] <%pectusumbra> reminder your enemy is weak vs. laser
[2:14:06] <%emperordread> It's certainly Rogue Adjacent @Joe2187

[2:17:10] <%pectusumbra> this music is not bad
[2:17:23] <%Lazyjoules> SourPls
[2:17:37] <%wicketpelican> This msuic is great
[2:17:43] <+AsinPersuasion> i keep thinking this game is related to dungeon of the endless/endless space
[2:17:49] <%wicketpelican> Woolie is doing a lot better than I expected, sadly he will not get punch girl in this session
[2:18:15] <+fizzguy47> all allies
[2:18:35] <%wicketpelican> Battlecry is really good with specials
[2:18:42] <%Javaa01> Taunting draws aggro to one characters, and buffs your allies
[2:19:05] <%wicketpelican> You only notice the aggro change if you have more than one front character,.
[2:19:06] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:20:33] <%wicketpelican> Blitz the early dude and Cleave anyone
[2:21:50] <maxpasta> SourPls
[2:22:32] <dapperskeleton69> the pastelverse
[2:23:01] <lotharrio> Preventing enemy crits makes sense.
[2:24:46] <%Akizea> Blitz is super powerful if sabo still has a turn
[2:25:03] <%Akizea> cleave the shit outta him
[2:25:06] <dapperskeleton69> blitz seems OP AF
[2:25:16] <%wicketpelican> Blitz gives almsot no damage, its only good to delay actions.
[2:25:20] <%Akizea> sabo is great for staggering
[2:25:21] <%Akizea> its amazing
[2:25:29] <%Heavensguard92> Break the enemy so they take more dmg
[2:25:30] <%wicketpelican> Later theres a better ability than Blitz, my favorite one actually
[2:25:42] <dapperskeleton69> whats it called wick?
[2:25:44] <%ironohki> I'm playing Warframe with this on the audio and the music fits well.
[2:25:47] <%wicketpelican> Plant Bomb
[2:25:56] <%Akizea> well blitz is still better for staggering
[2:26:00] <%Akizea> but plant bomb is amazing
[2:26:12] <%Heavensguard92> Wick is right
[2:26:12] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:26:14] <%wicketpelican> Plant Bomb is just cool, teleporting in the enemy and planting a C4 is ultra cool.
[2:26:28] <dapperskeleton69> that does sound super cool
[2:26:30] <%wicketpelican> Also, BIG DAMAGE
[2:26:41] <%Heavensguard92> Bomb is why Sabo is the best
[2:27:00] <%wicketpelican> Takes two turns tho, one for planting, one for exploding, but a character later can give you an extra turn, so you can do both in a single action, really good.
[2:27:16] <dapperskeleton69> brooo i actually really want this now
[2:27:40] <%wicketpelican> I recommend playing this game so much, brilliant design, every class is ultra fun. My favorite is Aegis.
[2:27:56] <alphalejandro> is irradiated the new bp?
[2:28:24] <dapperskeleton69> how much is it on switch?
[2:28:26] <%Heavensguard92> Can even save the bomb for someone to break for extra dmg
[2:29:04] <%wicketpelican> I dunno on Switch, I have on Xbox Pass, it feels like I'm stealing from the devs cuz only the subscription cost.
[2:29:21] <alphalejandro> increase social links
[2:29:25] <+fizzguy47> THEY FUCKIN
[2:29:33] <%wicketpelican> Social Links can generate new classes, by fucking.
[2:29:36] <dapperskeleton69> OH THE FUOCKIN
[2:30:10] <%wicketpelican> One of the classes is so cool man, the coolest.
[2:30:13] <dapperskeleton69> convince them to take bullets for eachother
[2:30:27] <+fizzguy47> purple cards are free
[2:30:36] <alphalejandro> unlock the ultimate personas
[2:30:36] <%Javaa01> Dynamic Duo is a free social link boost
[2:30:39] <DianaTheAscian> its a conversation prob
[2:30:54] <%wicketpelican> Get love woolie, realtionship points.
[2:31:04] <%Heavensguard92> Increase social for All out attacks
[2:31:27] <%wicketpelican> Heavens is right, social link sfor supers.
[2:31:29] <+fizzguy47> press RT to see overview
[2:31:31] <%heartlesshealer> social link go!
[2:31:41] <Make_me_mad> The dynamic duo cards are for set characters.
[2:31:46] <Make_me_mad> Based on who beat the boss.
[2:31:47] <DianaTheAscian> its specific
[2:31:49] <EternalJedi> Duo's are specific
[2:31:51] <%heartlesshealer> Blue outline is Card Owner
[2:32:01] <lotharrio> That's who it showed when you got the card.
[2:32:21] <+fizzguy47> @make_me_mad It's unclear, tbh. It feels random sometimes
[2:32:47] <Make_me_mad> @fizzguy47 I never tested it, but I assumed it was based on who the last two characters to hit the boss were.
[2:33:20] <%heartlesshealer> self-flagellation
[2:33:21] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:33:39] <%wicketpelican> @Make_me_mad its not, the Support characters also win sometimes. I think it's random.
[2:33:53] <alphalejandro> muther
[2:34:05] <+fizzguy47> @make_me_mad I thought so too, but it's not always true
[2:34:18] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Vanel Altair will return!
[2:34:56] <%heartlesshealer> Top two not checked
[2:35:10] <+fizzguy47> i hate that exploiting his weakness makes him stronger

[2:51:11] <%emperordread> Seein stars
[2:51:20] <+PapaGravestone> yo how is this? I just saw that this stream was live and I've been eying this game for a minute
[2:51:23] <+Jaysky> [ R U N G]
[2:51:34] <+Jaysky> Shookith
[2:51:52] <+fizzguy47> Rattled means you take more stagger time delay
[2:52:02] <%Heavensguard92> Embrace Sabotage
[2:53:22] <ItsKamWithAK> @PapaGravestone I cant answer if its any good as I just popped into the stream myself but its on gamepass which is only $1 right now
[2:53:22] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:53:32] <ItsKamWithAK> figured Id try it out that way
[2:54:20] <+PapaGravestone> @ItsKamWithAK oh yeah I keep forgetting game pass is also a pc thing
[2:54:30] <%wicketpelican> Game Pass on PC is crazy good
[2:54:44] <%wicketpelican> Tons of indie good games, theres Yakuza 0, Kiwami and Kiwami 2, a bunch of other stuff too
[2:55:04] <lotharrio> Build that Fury, I guess. Stun is amazing.
[2:55:05] <zenanon> Outer Worlds, all the Halos and Final Fantasy
[2:55:07] <ItsKamWithAK> As did I, I also realized how you cant talk about gamepass without sounding like a shill for Microsoft
[2:55:07] <%wicketpelican> Indie games that just launched are in there too. Contagion was there at the launch day.
[2:55:39] <%wicketpelican> The only shitty thing about the GamePass is that you can't mod games... Which is a HUGE point against it.
[2:55:44] <%Heavensguard92> And like that, Nodo proves his worth PogChamp
[2:56:00] <+TalekAetem> This reminds me of Hyper Light Drifter
[2:56:05] <+TalekAetem> Maybe graphics wise
[2:56:11] <ItsKamWithAK> Yeah but for trying games like this it serves its purpose, if I like it ill just buy it on steam
[2:56:23] <%wicketpelican> Is more close to Dungeon of Endless in the graphics department. Or Children of Morta.
[2:57:03] <+TalekAetem> Man, I bought Dungeons of Endless and stopped playing it for some reason. I might go back and try it again
[2:57:28] <%wicketpelican> Every time I tried playing Dungeon of Endless I stopped also. Dunno why, just didn't stick.
[2:57:52] <%wicketpelican> Well Woolie you can have 6 party members and theres about 15 classes.
[2:58:10] <zenanon> Dungeon of the Endless is also on gamepass pc lol
[2:58:11] <%wicketpelican> And all those classes have variations
[2:58:36] <%heartlesshealer> no cleave
[2:58:56] <%wicketpelican> Woolie is spamming Cleave way too much, on later stages he will be demolished.
[2:59:05] <zenanon> Nodo's blitz skill is clutch for breaks
[2:59:09] <%wicketpelican> First World is free
[2:59:17] <%heartlesshealer> the problem is it's just such a good simple name for a sword attack
[2:59:40] <%heartlesshealer> jumps up in the brain immediately
[3:00:13] <%wicketpelican> The backgrounds of this game are also insane. I wonder how they made it, I can't pull this off on Unity easily,.
[3:02:25] <+JonThePrettyOKGuy> between this game and Octopath, I think adding shadows to pixel sprites is some hidden tech to make pixel art look incredible
[3:02:25] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule

[3:06:50] <pi_in_the_sci> those come back
[3:06:55] <%heartlesshealer> green cards respawn
[3:07:00] <%mitchteck> Green come back
[3:07:03] <%Tearonex> @woolieversus the cards come back at the start of every camp
[3:07:06] <lotharrio> What about red ones?
[3:07:06] <%Heavensguard92> Abuse the cards
[3:07:06] <+fizzguy47> only if they say exhaust
[3:07:17] <%heartlesshealer> ^
[3:07:26] <%wicketpelican> Always heal first, shield buff second, then damage.
[3:07:36] <%Heavensguard92> Lvl up those social links
[3:07:48] <%wicketpelican> Yeah also try to level up social, special skills and good passives.
[3:08:04] <%wicketpelican> The supers/combo attacks comes from the fucking.
[3:08:19] <%Heavensguard92> Get that loot
[3:08:54] <+SWindleFeD> Why is there no rpg that has a hate mechanic instead of a friendship mechanic, just acting like a complete dick to your rival/s

[3:11:20] <%heartlesshealer> you want to deal those cracked yellow shields of damage
[3:11:54] <lotharrio> Save up for the stun, next turn.
[3:13:53] <%heartlesshealer> uh oh, slowed
[3:14:53] <TomFrancis_> stuns are op in this genre of game
[3:15:34] <MinnitMan> they weren't lying on the podcast, these graphics are incredible
[3:15:40] <+fizzguy47> @tomfrancis_ Most of the characters only get one, while enemies can stun multiple times per combat

[3:17:54] <burstangel15> This game looks fantasic
[3:18:17] <+fizzguy47> I wanna bang that robot
[3:18:25] <%heartlesshealer> dna time
[3:18:38] <%Javaa01> Also a gear crate
[3:18:41] <%Javaa01> On this tile
[3:18:43] <+GenesisKnight> isn't there loot up north
[3:20:22] <%Javaa01> Armor steal seems very good
[3:20:24] <%heartlesshealer> stealing health or stealing armor sounds good
[3:20:42] <%heartlesshealer> 3
[3:20:48] <%heartlesshealer> you can stash for later
[3:21:00] <%heartlesshealer> UMM
[3:21:08] <%Heavensguard92> You need to recover armor somehow
[3:21:16] <PanicSwytch> Is this game on console also?
[3:21:28] <lotharrio> @PanicSwytch Not just yet
[3:21:43] <%heartlesshealer> there are runs where you can totally gun it
[3:22:04] <%heartlesshealer> it saves after last fight when you Save & Quit apparently
[3:22:14] <%Javaa01> Yeah at this point, it's probably suicide to go for the boss
[3:22:51] <%heartlesshealer> there's a high level equip chest north, and then there's all that stuff to the east/southeast
[3:22:56] <lotharrio> There was an epic box up north of you.
[3:23:02] <%heartlesshealer> full heal is Party
[3:23:04] <+dmtjinni> \woolz
[3:23:34] <+Pyroclase> It's unbelievable how good this looks
[3:23:42] <%heartlesshealer> north has mini-boss, other path is normal fight
[3:24:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> pretty
[3:24:07] <+SWindleFeD> So in the stream layout I can see Vergil and Necalli, but I don't know who the rest are, can someone tell me who they are please
[3:24:07] <%heartlesshealer> bridge fight <3
[3:24:11] <haisho> but is the bridge big?
[3:24:41] <EternalJedi> SWindleFeD guy with the hat and mask is Kamen Rider Skull, idk the others
[3:25:18] <lotharrio> That heavy weapons woman from Overwatch?
[3:25:19] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts

[3:26:31] <%Superbro64> @kekkerscrew 7:30 pm eastern
[3:27:00] <%kekkerscrew> been playing this, it's tough
[3:28:57] <%Javaa01> And with this, you can also equip that implant

[3:29:15] <%heartlesshealer> yeah, they can go into menu after camp
[3:29:30] <%mitchteck> Equip implant
[3:30:41] <+aishman> aishman subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months! Hey Woolie and Reggie. Thanks to you two now I too am doing my first play through of TTYD. Game is fucking wild and they really is nothing like it. Keep on keeping on you wonderful, crazy diamonds.

[3:31:27] <%heartlesshealer> middle equip
[3:31:32] <%Heavensguard92> Poor xurx being left out of the romance
[3:31:44] <%heartlesshealer> it's cool. Gotta symbol match
[3:32:29] <%heartlesshealer> umm
[3:32:40] <%heartlesshealer> oh well
[3:33:01] <%heartlesshealer> learning is always a plus
[3:33:32] <%mitchteck> This fight busted my ass first time
[3:33:32] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:33:35] <%heartlesshealer> oh no! LUL
[3:33:42] <+Pyroclase> oh nooooo
[3:34:03] <%Heavensguard92> Trick shot saved me on this fight
[3:34:38] <%heartlesshealer> stun <3
[3:34:39] <lotharrio> I mean, it's not like we expected him to win the first time, right?
[3:34:47] <+dmtjinni> Woolz

[3:36:51] <NiktenKing> METAL GEAR
[3:37:01] <%heartlesshealer> 206 damage attack that eats 8 armor
[3:37:14] <+dmtjinni> LUL
[3:37:14] <%Heavensguard92> Break the shields. Shred the armor. Erase his life!
[3:37:16] <%mitchteck> Oh they fucked
[3:38:16] <%Heavensguard92> Blitz no! Early trck shot
[3:38:18] <%heartlesshealer> slowly eat that 35 armor
[3:38:44] <%Heavensguard92> You fool LUL LUL LUL
[3:38:53] <%heartlesshealer> Bullet Hell is THE attack to stop!
[3:39:09] <%Tearonex> They’re done
[3:39:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> so in this game what happens when you die
[3:39:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> what carries over
[3:39:16] <%heartlesshealer> defense and pray
[3:39:26] <%kekkerscrew> If you die you die.
[3:39:30] <MinnitMan> welp
[3:39:31] <NiktenKing> He will not, he will not be moved
[3:39:41] <lotharrio> Trick Shot is once per fight right?
[3:39:42] <%heartlesshealer> early bullet hell is RNG saying "No"
[3:39:47] <%Heavensguard92> Trick shot couldve stopped that bullet hell
[3:39:47] <%kekkerscrew> This is a big beefy boy. I've not beaten him yet.
[3:39:47] <%mitchteck> Defend
[3:40:13] <%kekkerscrew> I've come close, my next run might take him
[3:40:25] <%Akizea> i got super lucky on my very first clear of him
[3:40:30] <%Akizea> but now i think i got him down
[3:40:32] <+fizzguy47> the damage is spread across all randomly
[3:40:32] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:41:11] <%Heavensguard92> Trick shot saved my first ever go at this beef
[3:41:58] <%heartlesshealer> Fine Print
[3:42:07] <+GenesisKnight> Gotta read that fine print
[3:42:18] <%heartlesshealer> Enjoy learning the Roguelike part of the game mechanics!
[3:42:18] <%mitchteck> Ooof
[3:42:37] <%mitchteck> Big oofs
[3:42:58] <viciousgrim> this game permadeath?
[3:43:18] <%Heavensguard92> Battlecry and trick shot are super useful
[3:43:33] <%heartlesshealer> yes and no? You send the lil robot buddy into another reality where the you over there didn't fight yet
[3:43:33] <%kekkerscrew> It is what it is
[3:43:41] <+GenesisKnight> Whatever happens happens
[3:43:48] <%mitchteck> Blitz
[3:43:51] <%Javaa01> Righteousness is up and will cancel the attack
[3:44:00] <%kekkerscrew> yes
[3:44:05] <%Heavensguard92> Blitz
[3:44:06] <%heartlesshealer> Righteousness has the stun property
[3:44:14] <lotharrio> Blitz will earn you a turn.
[3:44:16] <NiktenKing> Will stun and won't contribute to break
[3:44:47] <%Heavensguard92> Blitz 1st then Righteousness
[3:44:52] <%heartlesshealer> umm
[3:45:24] <NiktenKing> Reggie with the strats
[3:46:04] <+GenesisKnight> There's a chance
[3:46:07] <dapperskeleton69> this is real RPG hours

[3:49:09] <NiktenKing> LUL
[3:49:13] <dapperskeleton69> love is just chemicals in your brain
[3:49:13] <+Pyroclase> oh MAN
[3:49:15] <+GenesisKnight> FeelsBadMan
[3:49:34] <%heartlesshealer> Bullet Hell is persisting. RNG does not like Woolie
[3:49:59] <%Javaa01> Yeah, this bullet hell is gonna seal the deal for this run
[3:50:20] <+fizzguy47> blitz is mvp
[3:50:30] <bevyrage> he'll be able to defend and survive it again
[3:50:32] <%Tearonex> I got 3 bullet hells in a row the first time I fought this guy, is that on purpose you you can’t beat him?
[3:50:37] <@Menitta> bullet hell>
[3:50:38] <@Menitta> ?
[3:50:52] <%heartlesshealer> oh boy
[3:50:54] <bevyrage> bullet hell is a high damage, but randomly assigned attack
[3:50:55] <+Joe2187> what does bullet hell do?
[3:50:59] <@Menitta> Oooh
[3:51:03] <%heartlesshealer> bullet hell is bullet hell
[3:51:07] <@Menitta> That's hell indeed
[3:51:09] <%heartlesshealer> lots of shot, lots of damage
[3:51:11] <NiktenKing> Defend?
[3:51:12] <%Javaa01> @Joe2187 It kills you
[3:51:18] <+fizzguy47> 10 shots across the board
[3:51:21] <%kekkerscrew> It's been an honor
[3:51:29] <+GenesisKnight> We livin
[3:51:36] <%heartlesshealer> defending matters in this game <3
[3:51:39] <%kyh9> Just holdYEYEYE
[3:51:44] <bevyrage> for real if you have full shields you shouldn't get merc'd by bullet hell
[3:51:49] <bevyrage> unless rng says you die
[3:51:49] <+FairOnFire> we live, bitch
[3:51:56] <+fizzguy47> RNG smiles upon you
[3:52:04] <%wicketpelican> It does, this world is free, but its ok to lose, you'll get really good improvements after the first reset
[3:52:04] <+teh_rawk> damn this looks gorgeous
[3:52:35] <%Heavensguard92> If break shields, he may reboot again
[3:52:42] <%kekkerscrew> Sheilds down Real Damage
[3:53:09] <+fizzguy47> mmmm
[3:53:18] <%heartlesshealer> UMM
[3:53:23] <%heartlesshealer> Shields is post-hit
[3:53:24] <+cubbywolf> it tells you when they go
[3:53:33] <lotharrio> Prevent his crit
[3:53:41] <ofalconer> It's gonna crit anything that comes after his attack
[3:53:49] <bevyrage> crit on the timeline
[3:53:57] <%heartlesshealer> RIP Robo Cleric o7
[3:54:01] <%Javaa01> Yeah trying to give yourself shields is just gonna get you hit even harder
[3:54:18] <+cubbywolf> woolie listen to the universe
[3:54:25] <TehMud> I just got this game a couple hours ago thanks to you guys. I just got DESTROYED by this guy RIP
[3:54:28] <%Javaa01> He's not gonna live until he gets a chance to up his shields
[3:54:50] <+cubbywolf> if he crits the robot will it be knocked back a turn?
[3:54:50] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:54:55] <%kyh9> Wait, isn't that the timeline at the top?
[3:55:00] <CureMode666> woolie when is the hades play thru
[3:55:07] <bevyrage> timeline is at the top yes. enemy is on the bottom with a CRIT
[3:55:09] <%heartlesshealer> Napalm is less bad than bullet hell, RNG just hates you with spamming AoE attacks
[3:55:12] <+cubbywolf> its either quick attacks or all block
[3:55:16] <%Heavensguard92> Crit on xurx dies
[3:55:34] <NiktenKing> He will crit for 91 if you try to shield
[3:55:36] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[3:55:38] <TehMud> @cubbywolf No. When the counter by their icon on the top bar is at 0 you can't knock them back anymore.
[3:55:50] <+cubbywolf> ah thats what the number is
[3:55:59] <%Heavensguard92> Woolie is really holding on
[3:56:09] <%heartlesshealer> Gamma Beam is only just now coming out
[3:56:15] <+fizzguy47> holy shit this is great
[3:56:22] <%kekkerscrew> woolie is doing really good
[3:56:31] <%Heavensguard92> Break for Righteousness
[3:56:32] <%heartlesshealer> woolie is doing really good
[3:56:37] <+Joe2187> What does break mean?
[3:56:41] <TehMud> Way better than I did
[3:56:46] <+cubbywolf> if woolie attacked with the 2 characters then break, would that be optimal?
[3:56:46] <bevyrage> break means the turn gets pushed back a round
[3:56:47] <%heartlesshealer> Break as in breaking their turn
[3:56:50] <+cubbywolf> or does it not matter?
[3:57:08] <lotharrio> Battlecry is a taunt, will redirect the focus.
[3:57:13] <%Heavensguard92> You got righteousness for next turn
[3:57:18] <%heartlesshealer> No Righteousness stun if no fury
[3:57:20] <%Javaa01> You have Stun next turn with Righteousness
[3:57:26] <%mitchteck> Titans stregnth
[3:57:38] <%Javaa01> Righteousness is reusable
[3:57:40] <%heartlesshealer> it's the other shot
[3:57:42] <+fizzguy47> They've used Righteousness
[3:57:48] <%heartlesshealer> the other shot is One and Done
[3:57:55] <Blank9> only reason he can't use it is he blitzed with the other character
[3:57:55] <%Heavensguard92> Save 4 righteousness
[3:57:58] <%Javaa01> It's on cooldown because you Blitzed
[3:58:10] <lotharrio> I thought it said combos are always once per battle?
[3:58:18] <+Joe2187> is there no way to heal?
[3:58:20] <+fizzguy47> Righteousness does not come back
[3:58:23] <%Javaa01> But since it's a free action on the timeline, you can get it instantly next turn and kill his attack
[3:58:29] <%heartlesshealer> ?????
[3:58:44] <%heartlesshealer> I'm probably wrong, I don't remember the text on dual tech tutorial
[3:58:45] <%kekkerscrew> healing is on equipment from what I 've seen
[3:58:54] <+fizzguy47> Combos are once per combat, they used it earlier
[3:58:58] <+cubbywolf> not enough hp?
[3:59:09] <%kyh9> LOL
[3:59:10] <+GenesisKnight> One guy
[3:59:12] <%kyh9> ONE GUY

[3:59:41] <lotharrio> Battlecry is a taunt, you can redirect the attack at least.
[3:59:42] <%Javaa01> Well, that's a bummer
[3:59:43] <+cubbywolf> GOTEE
[3:59:51] <$hypermegashun> you need fury for combo
[3:59:53] <+fizzguy47> You can use the Titans strength as long as you have fury

[4:06:45] <%FairOnFire> FairOnFire subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[4:06:52] <+Krasmeyts> Game is fantastic
[4:06:52] <NiktenKing> It pushes 30s
[4:06:57] <+ArcanumArcanum> the explosives are super good for big AoE damage
[4:07:13] <%Heavensguard92> Bomb always crits
[4:07:42] <NiktenKing> This game FUCKS
[4:07:44] <+dmtjinni> LUL
[4:08:05] <EternalJedi> NiktenKing it doesn't push out the gate, that's the alternate Denonate
[4:08:07] <ShinobiPhoenix> @WoolieVersus I just got home from work and I couldn't listen to Castle Super Beast at RTX while at work. Anyway to catch it still?
[4:08:09] <EternalJedi> *detonate
[4:08:09] <%McGwinnus> McGwinnus subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[4:08:18] <+Pyroclase> WEll, you saw six slots.
[4:08:23] <lotharrio> Didn't get that marine looking guy.
[4:08:27] <+Pyroclase> I assume there's currently six characters then
[4:08:31] <+Joe2187> I erronously thought woolie was playing Star Gladiator for a second when he announced it on twitter....
[4:08:32] <Blank9> @ShinobiPhoenix It's on roosterteeth's site
[4:08:32] <+fizzguy47> you gonna learn, Woolie
[4:08:46] <ShinobiPhoenix> do you have to be a paid member to see it?
[4:08:59] <ShinobiPhoenix> I saw all that "RT First stuff last time I was on there
[4:09:00] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:09:42] <%Superbro64> woolie with the first try PogChamp
[4:09:49] <+cubbywolf> the woolie VS show, starring Reggie, guest staring woolie woolington
[4:09:58] <%Superbro64> inb4 this one off becomes a two off
[4:10:35] <%wicketpelican> Sadly woolie didn't see the Punchgirl
[4:10:50] <%emperordread> one more run, one more run
[4:10:57] <ZeeJiggle> Ye save it for another time
[4:11:07] <%Javaa01> Yeah at best you'd get like one half decent run out of it
[4:11:37] <%wicketpelican> Woolie it's a punchgirl in a mecha armor.
[4:11:42] <+Javaa01> And it takes like 3-ish runs to properly get past the spaghetti of the rhythm
[4:11:47] <+Fattness132> its a roguelike
[4:11:50] <+Pyroclase> it's a roguelike
[4:11:53] <ZeeJiggle> BPM is a roguelike
[4:12:06] <%Javaa01> The structure is very similar to Binding of Isaac
[4:12:29] <ShinobiPhoenix> roguelike or roguelite?
[4:13:16] <%Javaa01> It's a Roguelite, but the vertical progression elements are very light in BPM
[4:14:14] <mightyfat> Pat says runs in this game are super long
[4:14:29] <%kyh9> ROSHI
[4:14:36] <NiktenKing> Propels himself with one hand Kamehamehas
[4:14:44] <+cubbywolf> base ku best ku
[4:15:55] <%emperordread> Yamcha Main 4lyfe
[4:15:58] <+cubbywolf> did woolz ever play gogeta and his awesome lvl 5?
[4:16:39] <+cvp5127> pick a top tier
[4:16:39] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1305742410211876864?s=19
[4:17:41] <+Pyroclase> I'm hearing very polarized views on BPM and I'm really interested to see your take
[4:17:47] <Josef_Stryker> LUL
[4:17:49] <+cubbywolf> some people...
[4:17:58] <+cubbywolf> some people advance humanity as a whole
[4:18:02] <Blank9> like ren and stimpy
[4:18:06] <%Javaa01> Auto rhythm is a bit much, but yeah, crank down that saturation by at least like 20%, it's pretty hard to see items at default saturation
[4:18:57] <+cubbywolf> mood lighting
[4:19:23] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> !uptime
[4:19:23] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 19 minutes
[4:19:24] <%kyh9> They've really hit their stride
[4:19:36] <+Pyroclase> I do want AA games to be a thing again
[4:19:38] <%Javaa01> THPS is probably the only truly clean big name release this year
[4:19:48] <%Javaa01> Everything else has had problems, big or small
[4:19:53] <%kyh9> Filling a niche that wasn't addressed by other companies, but now becoming its own thing
[4:19:54] <%emperordread> Agile development can generally eat my balls, but can't deny it's capable in a disrputed situation like covid
[4:19:57] <%wicketpelican> Woolie what is your instance on beef. Rare, Medium, Well Done?
[4:20:03] <@Menitta> I wish there would be more SNK style pixel art games. Aiming for realistic pixel art, not just pixel art.
[4:20:24] <@Menitta> Like they have an art style but they're just using spritesd
[4:20:45] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> @wicketpelican “Rare. Medium. Tastes like shit!”

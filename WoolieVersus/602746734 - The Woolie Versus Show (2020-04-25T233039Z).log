[0:38:12] <Josef_Stryker> LUL
[0:38:13] <zenith0111> You binge that shit
[0:38:15] <Aydarkzero> i stopped at 3 b/c i couldn't get into it
[0:38:16] <%Fujiwara_92> LUL
[0:38:16] <%GenesisKnight> That's cowardice
[0:38:17] <phatmac16> that defeats the whole purpose of the show
[0:38:20] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that's actually insane
[0:38:29] <%Fujiwara_92> KAMINA DIED? I'M OUT LUL
[0:38:29] <InXplotch> didnt people DO that though? With that one gurren laggan episode that had the weird artstyle

[0:38:40] <barucafe> I knew someone who dropped Code Geass at episode 48
[0:38:46] <+Grayhammatter> werk
[0:38:46] <Randomly_Werewolf> Same @cn_alpha_02
[0:38:48] <%jiggy_snipe> Men at Work
[0:38:51] <DavidDredd84> Dokapon atpGasm atpGasm
[0:38:55] <quasiplaying> @woolieversus I honestly wished Lucky Star kept going
[0:38:55] <%MisterArcanine> Honestly you’re good to stop there Rubbishbinge
[0:38:55] <%nintega010> @rubbishbinge that's understandable
[0:38:57] <%Amaideus> Doesn't Code Geass only have like 50 something episodes though?
[0:39:01] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> imagine stopping promare after they capture Lio
[0:39:01] <zenith0111> @barucafe What episode is that?
[0:39:06] <bipdipper> makes sense cause the 2nd season of code geass sucks
[0:39:07] <Jetsfantasy> This is the power of the Tandem Engine
[0:39:08] <+Grayhammatter> oh shit, the art of war AND dokapon
[0:39:16] <%MisterArcanine> Because Death Note has a terrible ending
[0:39:23] <%andrei11dr> All thought things with enormous length are very intimidating for me ,Gundam and One Piece were two big ones
[0:39:32] <+robobeau> While you were fuckboi-inh, Minh was practicing THE ART OF WAR
[0:39:32] <+evbites> wtf
[0:39:33] <%Jetzord> I never understood that
[0:39:36] <%Rhinoprotoss> Use it for fight games?
[0:39:41] <Daba_mk2> I'm gonna use this for fighting games
[0:39:49] <barucafe> @zenith0111 2 episodes before the end. IMO the part that made the show worth watching at all
[0:40:01] <%Fujiwara_92> I'm gonna use to play dynasty warriors Kappa
[0:40:13] <%gunsrlove> He's sending a message
[0:40:13] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[0:40:22] <%emperordread> A lot of the art of war is common sense nowadays, it's been internalised into strategy so much that it's ubiquitous
[0:40:27] <%MisterArcanine> Minh is using the art of war in Dokapon right now
[0:40:31] <%Jetzord> I feel like a lot of the Art of War just feels like common sense
[0:40:33] <%EyeFarted> Reggie come in with the Kama Sutra
[0:40:37] <phatmac16> The anarchist cook book
[0:40:40] <+b_aleph> Bringing the Vade Mecum to the session

[0:47:27] <GaimDS> @angriestangryartist I'm sure it's a mistranslation of the English language Kappa
[0:47:30] <CasualAlohaFriday> There's a Garfield racing game? Are any U.S. Acres characters in this?
[0:47:30] <+jbaker009> @woolieversus my friend's dad has a pet crow with the same as Lovecrafts cat
[0:47:32] <+BoboDaHobo> Lovecraft was afraid of literally everything, of course he was a racist shit
[0:47:34] <%Solidnick18> seems pretty much like it
[0:47:35] <kingkeldeo31> Lovecraft: You thought I was a chill dude that wrote about eldrich horrors, but no filthy racist.
[0:47:38] <NZolozabal> "Oh no, somebody born in the late 1890s was racist!" THE MAN IS DEAD! GET OVER IT!
[0:47:39] <Aussie_Manny> Garfield and Friends was fantastic. Early Saturday mornings well spent. electr18Lv
[0:47:40] <TigerClaws12> LUL
[0:47:41] <%yeknomlive> is it like doc and marty garfield
[0:47:43] <%Solidnick18> oh
[0:47:56] <+AngriestAngryArtist> @GaimDS could be a french name.
[0:47:56] <nothuzad> play GENSOU Skydrift you cowards :)
[0:48:02] <+TopTieramisu> lovecraft's greatest fear was reverse gentrification
[0:48:05] <+tearknack> @BoboDaHobo other way around though
[0:48:09] <+Sochin_Iitsu> Lasagna bonus
[0:48:11] <am_omega> Nah its more than that.
[0:48:15] <Super_Voltekka> What's this Hydro Thunder bullshit doing in a Garfield game?
[0:48:17] <nothuzad> lovecrafts biggest fear was the irish
[0:48:17] <gustavozxd> 1890? atpRtsd
[0:48:17] <+Sochin_Iitsu> MAN I could go for some lasagna
[0:48:19] <Quietshun13> counters PogChamp
[0:48:23] <kaine_west> @nzolozabal chill bro its just a joke cmonBruh
[0:48:26] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> fake game
[0:48:26] <rcand9> racer man
[0:48:27] <dapperskeleton69> "i dont know what they do" AS HES ON THE ITEM SCREEN
[0:48:27] <%Solidnick18> that's a piza
[0:48:30] <GaimDS> a Lovecraft story literally ends with the protagonist going nuts about seeing a black woman Kappa
[0:48:34] <+Sochin_Iitsu> All's forgiven
[0:48:35] <am_omega> There was "Normal for the time" and "Bro that is legit hate"
[0:48:43] <coreybom> @nzolozabal Oh sweetheart you don't understand. He was SO racist that even other racist at the time thought he was too much.
[0:48:43] <Rhinoprotoss> 150cc cowards
[0:48:44] <am_omega> Lovecraft is the later.
[0:48:44] <Aussie_Manny> Lasagna is pasta cake. HahaThink
[0:48:48] <odiz395> btw did you guys here about The Dood having a kid ?
[0:48:52] <%Solidnick18> garfield just likes eating
[0:48:59] <+Sochin_Iitsu> Remember, even at the time Lovecraft was racist
[0:49:00] <%Solidnick18> Omg
[0:49:00] <Rangenade> cc means the amount of crack cocaine
[0:49:01] <Vyneci> 4Head
[0:49:02] <gustavozxd> oh no
[0:49:02] <+TopTieramisu> I'm Sorry Jon
[0:49:03] <MyNameIsRasus> Lovecraft was the original Time Cube
[0:49:03] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[0:49:04] <+tearknack> also, people tend to ignore the people who WEREN'T racist for their time
[0:49:05] <dapperskeleton69> garfield you fat cat

[0:49:08] <DedlokPM> https://clips.twitch.tv/SteamyHotClipzPeteZaroll

[0:49:25] <Finakala> Girlfield
[0:49:26] <%Solidnick18> yeah man
[0:49:26] <+Qsmash_> Garfield was funny at some point
[0:49:28] <dapperskeleton69> doingdoingdoingdoing
[0:49:31] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Reggie fake Garfield fan
[0:49:34] <SuperKirby24> GARFIELD FUCKS
[0:49:34] <GaimDS> Arlene is not that weiiiird
[0:49:35] <%Solidnick18> i used to in the paper
[0:49:36] <+Emperor_Bad> girlfield
[0:49:40] <GaimDS> REGGIE YOU POSER
[0:49:41] <CasualAlohaFriday> I'd lose my shit if Lyman were in this
[0:49:45] <%yeknomlive> go read garfield without garfield
[0:49:46] <rcand9> garfield gets his dick wet
[0:49:51] <+TopTieramisu> teath
[0:50:01] <+ChrisAlgoo> read the Garfield manga, posers
[0:50:07] <dapperskeleton69> whos who
[0:50:07] <%FuqBoiSlim> this game hurts extra hard because I remember religiously watching the Garfield cgi cartoon this game is based off of
[0:50:08] <NZolozabal> Arlene wasn't in the cartoon to my knowledge.
[0:50:19] <%Infernal_Dalek> Waste of screen space
[0:50:20] <DaBigVitus> garfield and friends was sweet
[0:50:23] <+Sochin_Iitsu> Anyway, if you enjoy the feeling of having your soul sucked from your body, check out the MBMBAM bit about the Garfield Monstrosity
[0:50:27] <+TopTieramisu> i read the Garfield light novels
[0:50:32] <%Infernal_Dalek> Why not have a map in unoccupied corner???
[0:50:36] <%Solidnick18> sonic team racing DansGame
[0:50:39] <%yeknomlive> i watched the garfield stage play to get all the lore
[0:50:41] <GaimDS> the Garfield isekai Anime was pretty good
[0:50:50] <%Prevot> snaking DansGame
[0:50:51] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:50:51] <+Manderson1998> I firmly believe sonic team racing shouldve had at least twice as many characters
[0:50:57] <am_omega> the true Garfield anime was the best.
[0:50:58] <dapperskeleton69> @gaimds pardon?
[0:51:02] <+TopTieramisu> garfield is an isekai of an eldritch horror living on earth
[0:51:11] <GaimDS> @dapperskeleton69 you heard me
[0:51:18] <%Valask> do you know what an isekai is man
[0:51:19] <NZolozabal> I forgot what year Jon and Liz started dating, but kudos for staying together for so long.
[0:51:23] <am_omega> Remember when Jon fought off Garfiefel.
[0:51:25] <DXLelouch24> i assume this isnt the only racing game tonight right?

[0:54:04] <Amardeux> this looks like it doesn't feel nice to play LUL
[0:54:11] <DedlokPM> @TopTieramisu The vet lady girlfriend of Jon? I am not 100% sure
[0:54:14] <+Qsmash_> Nintendo should just make Double Dash 2
[0:54:20] <%Solidnick18> that's why reggie
[0:54:22] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> underrated
[0:54:38] <%Ecchigun> it just works
[0:54:46] <GrandmasterBFunk> Woolie choosing the Ryu of Garfield Cart, typical.
[0:54:51] <+superorangerobin> Licensed Kart Racers have a surprisingly decent track record
[0:54:52] <+TopTieramisu> so... what about this game sets it apart from other kart racers?
[0:54:54] <Amardeux> LUL

[0:56:23] <%Ecchigun> it got the core mechanics of mario kart
[0:56:25] <rcand9> now ctr is the best
[0:56:26] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> bullying Reggie : (

[0:57:30] <%Ecchigun> the game plays itself

[0:58:07] <GaimDS> Raiden sends a message to the past: "Nerman Must Win"
[0:58:20] <+superorangerobin> You find him and then you shoot him out at your opponents. His mustache is the spikes

[2:13:41] <%RioGascar> Yo who wants to play distance right now
[2:13:43] <universaldove> Talk about SSStylsih
[2:13:46] <Super_Voltekka> Getting mad Rush 2049 vibes here Kreygasm
[2:13:48] <@Solidus_113> there's a guiding compass on your back window
[2:13:48] <%RioGascar> imma boot my copy up
[2:13:49] <SidewinderFang> this game is the dark souls of sonic games :P
[2:13:50] <$SilverRoddo> Tracker’s gonna lead the mission!
[2:13:53] <%invisi_bliss> WE GOING THE DISTANCE
[2:14:01] <%croxeye> yo this is dope!
[2:14:10] <Amardeux> can minh even play this when it turns red? LUL
[2:14:20] <TheDeimion> jump
[2:14:35] <dapperskeleton69> CAR TRICJS
[2:14:40] <BioApple> YOOOO DISTANCE
[2:14:51] <+razielhex> This is like Wipeout, using Daytona USA models, in the world of SUPERHOT
[2:14:51] <@akuda_bar> @amardeux not how color blindness works. it doesn't make red shit invisible
[2:15:10] <NeroInfinite> Reggie can't think in4D
[2:15:14] <@akuda_bar> Reggie decreasing his distance
[2:15:16] <%RioGascar> You can fly too
[2:15:19] <@Squdnate> There's outlines
[2:15:24] <@Squdnate> So even if it was a colour you were blind to
[2:15:30] <%RioGascar> Its music is some good shit too
[2:15:31] <@Squdnate> You should be able to follow what is going on
[2:15:36] <Vyneci> Press B for placements
[2:15:48] <Vyneci> It also tells you how far from the end you are
[2:15:48] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:15:50] <supermexicansentai> This is pretty cool looking game
[2:15:57] <+razielhex> @Amardeux I have Protanopia just like Minh does. Not being able to "see" red doesn't mean things that are red are invisible. It's about tinting & shading; as long as there's contrast it's fine. But there's a reason I have a hard time as BLU in TF2 because of all the brown & green environments.
[2:16:06] <%RioGascar> The kickstarter for this was literally “YO WE LIKE TRON AND WANNA MAKE A TRON RACER...YOU IN?”
[2:16:08] <+fsdagarha> I have no idea what's happening but it looks cool
[2:16:12] <@Squdnate> The mixin' is a bit wack
[2:16:22] <nothuzad> so Distance is the commercialized version of Nitronic Rush - which was the devs final prototype when finishing scool
[2:16:28] <%Solidnick18> abit trippy
[2:16:30] <nothuzad> also check out the nitronic rush OST its great
[2:16:35] <@akuda_bar> all music no commentary is optimal
[2:16:36] <%RioGascar> and even nitronic rush is good
[2:16:47] <SidewinderFang> the second campain in Distance is a remake of nitronic rush
[2:16:55] <nothuzad> RioGascar I actually prefer Nitronic rush in some ways
[2:16:57] <SidewinderFang> complete with remixed nitronic rush music
[2:17:13] <+razielhex> what masochistic monster plays First Person racing games?
[2:17:16] <+fsdagarha> reminds me of kinetica, except it's cyber so they don't have to make any textures for tracks lol
[2:17:17] <Amardeux> I get that, just prepping for Minh to johns it up with his colour blideness LUL
[2:17:18] <@Solidus_113> It's like Rush 2049
[2:17:25] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Hovercar
[2:17:30] <BoneBagMel> THOSE WIGNS ARE RUSH
[2:17:37] <Amardeux> so yeah I know colour blindness don't work like htat
[2:17:43] <@Menitta> this is cool
[2:17:54] <%RioGascar> im hosting if people wanna join in and go the distance
[2:18:04] <%Prevot> this hurts to look at
[2:18:07] <Vyneci> Only problem is that the campaign acts as the tutorial, which is like an hour long LUL
[2:18:11] <dapperskeleton69> a e s t h e t i c

[2:18:25] <dapperskeleton69> yeah i wish it wasnt so orange
[2:18:29] <Vyneci> Y'all should play the campaigns one day, they're AMAZING
[2:18:35] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> 【Ａｅｓｔｈｅｔｉｃ】
[2:18:38] <BioApple> This isn't the usual aesthetic of the game, this map does suck visually
[2:18:58] <Vyneci> If you want to barrel roll in the air, hold LB and then spin
[2:19:13] <TigerClaws12> bumpers to roll @WoolieVersus
[2:19:18] <SidewinderFang> I like how this map looks

[3:08:20] <Vyneci> See if you unlocked new levels on sprint btw
[3:08:26] <@Menitta> thats a super cool feature
[3:08:29] <%Zyquux> "Untitled Goose Track"
[3:08:42] <Azelstahn> community tracks are great too.
[3:08:43] <Vyneci> There's also A LOT of maps in the workshop too
[3:08:45] <Nitsuj293> the single player is soooo cool
[3:09:10] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[3:09:13] <DedlokPM> https://clips.twitch.tv/CourteousBombasticFalconKeyboardCat
[3:09:14] <Azelstahn> they even have a distance advent calendar event for level creation too.
[3:09:17] <%Irridium> LUL
[3:09:40] <Personified134> if chat thinks this game is as sick as I do, I'm gonna throw up an online lobby after the stream ends
[3:09:48] <Personified134> and we can jam
[3:10:31] <@Solidus_113> NotLikeThis
[3:10:36] <am_omega> LUL
[3:10:41] <Vyneci> Yeah... turbines was not the best choice for a final level LUL
[3:11:06] <Azelstahn> some of the official levels were made by community members too.
[3:11:17] <%RioGascar> tried watching both stream and playing distance at same time in VR
[3:11:20] <%RioGascar> ow
[3:11:35] <Malucoblz02> i think i gonna hurl
[3:12:20] <Azelstahn> this level requires skills these guys know nothing about lol.
[3:12:20] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1227284596695404550?s=19
[3:12:32] <Personified134> yeah this is an advanced level the boys don't know their shit
[3:12:58] <%Solidnick18> wtf is going on
[3:13:01] <jaybonejay> No this is an easy level compared to the latter levels
[3:13:17] <+VariantX7> I don't like it when the stages in a racer get too abstract for their own good
[3:13:25] <jaybonejay> like inferno
[3:13:25] <Azelstahn> it still needs a tad bit of thruster user though.
[3:13:36] <TigerClaws12> you have to jump and barrel roll half way through in that mountain LUL
[3:13:42] <+tearknack> this game has some mecganics they don't seem to have figured out yet
[3:13:42] <+IamScorpius> What am I watching LUL
[3:13:44] <Vyneci> Disclaimer, this was originally a workshop track LUL
[3:13:50] <tranquilturnips> its easier to see on our end I think
[3:13:54] <jubejube56> So I presume they have to hit the multiple green tunnels to thrust to the finish?
[3:13:56] <jaybonejay> None of them have played the campaign
[3:14:16] <TigerClaws12> Woolie played a bit of campaign before the control scheme change
[3:14:20] <@Menitta> can you fly to the boost past the first one
[3:14:23] <Azelstahn> oh then that explains it
[3:14:24] <TigerClaws12> but yea they need that tutorial LUL
[3:14:30] <tranquilturnips> OMEGALUL
[3:14:31] <Vyneci> I KNEW IT
[3:14:31] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL Reggie
[3:14:32] <+Waonder> LUL
[3:14:34] <@Solidus_113> This a level for pros only
[3:14:35] <+Sochin_Iitsu> THAT SUCKS
[3:14:36] <jase__x> OMFG
[3:14:40] <%Solidnick18> OMG
[3:14:42] <rcand9> made by a mad man
[3:14:42] <Azelstahn> the campaign gives you tools that they need for sure.
[3:14:46] <jase__x> THIS IS ASS
[3:14:48] <%Solidnick18> Wow
[3:14:51] <@Menitta> look at minh shooting star his way through
[3:14:51] <@Squdnate> I have never touched this game, and I have figured it out
[3:14:52] <tranquilturnips> what am I racing FOORRR D:
[3:14:55] <%Gamefriendly> this one wasnt RNG?
[3:14:57] <+Justin_Wood> Solidus, my dude. o/
[3:14:59] <DedlokPM> you launch, boost, fly, keep flying by going through the other boosts
[3:14:59] <@Squdnate> Minh is just free falling

[3:16:36] <%Solidnick18> Minh is tumbling down tumbling down
[3:16:37] <am_omega> Eventually Minh stopped thinking

[3:17:20] <TigerClaws12> yea if shooting stars isn't edited in in the YT video LUL
[3:17:21] <Azelstahn> anyone want to fire up this level and beat it?
[3:17:22] <%RioGascar> distance is not a regular racer
[3:17:27] <NWannabe> He deserves this score
[3:17:28] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Eventually Kars stopped spinning
[3:17:30] <@Menitta> Minh: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-MQC_G9jTU
[3:17:32] <%RioGascar> its got god damn flying for god sake

[3:24:50] <+Justin_Wood> Out of curiosity, any interest in doing a video on something like Hacknet/Uplink/HackMud/any Zachtronics titles?

[3:35:46] <nothuzad> *wreckfest
[3:36:11] <%Gamefriendly> wreckfast still applies LUL
[3:36:39] <rcand9> i think i could play a game like this to death

[3:42:42] <rcand9> rally is fun to watch
[3:42:53] <rcand9> real dangerous
[3:42:59] <%HRDSalami654> Rally is for people who are insane.
[3:43:11] <%Hammerknife> if driving rally is anything like autox then it's gotta be super fun
[3:43:28] <%Gamefriendly> Give it up for Group B rally, the hypest shit there is
[3:43:32] <%HRDSalami654> "Hey, let's drive at 60mph along a narrow dirt road with no traction!"
[3:43:48] <rcand9> double last
[3:43:56] <%Hammerknife> the lack of traction makes it more fun tbh
[3:44:06] <%HRDSalami654> Yes.
[3:44:15] <%HRDSalami654> By insane, I didn't mean it wasn't fun.
[3:44:21] <%Gamefriendly> 60mph? more like 80+

[3:56:32] <$razielhex> PJSalt1000 Great Stream Woolie. Happy 7th Anniversary of the time you abandoned two hot bisexual women who were interested in a threesome because you had to go to GameStop for the midnight release of Marvel vs. Capcom 3 because you were afraid they'd run out of copies if you had sex.

[4:04:11] <%Hammerknife> yeah no its a dnd campaign
[4:04:16] <rcand9> so the box was like 1 whole pat?
[4:04:16] <Jigokuro> It's basically a DnD game in a box

[4:05:40] <%RioGascar> WHAT ABOUT ACCELLERACERS
[4:05:49] <%RioGascar> Written by the REBOOT GUYS
[4:06:01] <@Solidus_113> Hot Wheels had good shows
[4:06:01] <%Hammerknife> although there is a gloomhaven video game. wish it had multiplayer but its so beta it hurts
[4:06:02] <am_omega> Yo the live action movie was kinda legit.
[4:06:31] <rcand9> they were wrong it was fun as hell
[4:06:46] <%RioGascar> I see no reason for gloomhaveen to be a video game
[4:06:59] <am_omega> Yo like my favorite youtube video is the final scene but with Initial D music. its hype
[4:07:06] <%RioGascar> its like making doom a boardgame
[4:07:10] <%RioGascar> and that was done
[4:07:12] <%RioGascar> it sucks
[4:07:25] <@Solidus_113> going 500 miles in a CIRCLE
[4:07:33] <rcand9> DAYTONA YEEEEE
[4:07:33] <Super_Voltekka> "They're making a left TUUUUUUUUURN!"
[4:07:35] <%Hammerknife> i could see a mobile version of gloomhaven being fairly fun
[4:07:59] <%Hammerknife> but yeah 90% of it is table banter and watching people get blown out
[4:08:06] <am_omega> Yo NASCAR is hype when you bet on the races.

[4:08:35] <am_omega> Yo that one was sick.
[4:08:48] <@Solidus_113> Hot Wheels Highway 35 World Race but its Initial D
[4:08:59] <%RioGascar> that would be highway 35
[4:09:03] <am_omega> God it makes that movie super hype.
[4:09:14] <%RioGascar> Which accelleracers is the continuation
[4:09:16] <SuperKirby24> ITS SO GOOD

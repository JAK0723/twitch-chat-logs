[0:07:21] <$Chatterbox1991> MrDestructoid500 You;ve talked a bit lately about Open World games as a concept on the podcast; how it doesn't really grab you and how you don't see it as a preferable medium for story telling compared to a Kojima Hallway; i would argue that if you want a primer on open world story telling that you should check out RDR1; its way more focus and approachable as an open world than you think and is a masterclass in story telling, it might even be worth a quick look or lp; very much worth your time!

[0:59:11] <+floralkami> Woolie about to get smack around by a child
[0:59:12] <+lordsdb> He reminds me of that kid Shishio Makoto took in
[0:59:13] <rad_dude123465> HOLD DAT BUTTON
[0:59:26] <%GabeSweetMan> wut
[0:59:27] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[0:59:29] <%jinking79> he's holding it for 80 sec
[0:59:30] <Triplicat> samsho is the kind of game where you can press the button and immediately tell you fucked up and watch yourself slowly get fucked up in the next 1-3 seconds
[0:59:33] <%fFailureatlife> Darli gonna ara ara this shota
[0:59:34] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah you could do that
[0:59:34] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> what
[0:59:38] <zenith0111> What?
[0:59:40] <+Gooniekorn> They took out holding it at the character select
[0:59:44] <+ElectricFoxLex> Wrong, that's 5SP, not in this
[0:59:47] <%GabeSweetMan> That's DUMB! Why is it like that?!
[0:59:53] <tigerfang86> OH SHIT
[0:59:59] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah no more hold on character select, but he can still switch the hold button
[1:00:02] <+lordsdb> Seta Sōjirō is his name
[1:00:03] <Guntanks_in_Space> THERE IT IS
[1:00:04] <StreakThunderstorm> DEAT
[1:00:12] <+floralkami> @GabeSweetMan what you mean? That's tactics

[1:00:16] <mor3gan> wait thats a DUDE
[1:00:27] <tigerfang86> M Y G
[1:00:31] <%fFailureatlife> ARA ARA HIM WOOLIE
[1:00:35] <Guntanks_in_Space> now the character select charge TAP was a bug in SSVSP and was totally unintended, but it works
[1:00:36] <Admiral_PopnFresh> so any time Shizu isn't moving, assume he's charging
[1:00:37] <rosemon5001> just joined who is that next to reggie?
[1:00:37] <zenith0111> Is he saying magic?
[1:00:48] <Guntanks_in_Space> Lord Jimmy Bones, also a Canadian Fighting Game Streamer
[1:00:49] <%GabeSweetMan> @floralkami It's more specifically the ability to charge before the match has even started.
[1:00:53] <Guntanks_in_Space> and 2nd placer at CEOTaku
[1:00:56] <+OkamiDude15> darli gonna drain the life force outta this young lad
[1:00:57] <%GabeSweetMan> That's nuts to me.

[1:01:47] <tigerfang86> RAISE YOUR SHIELD
[1:01:52] <rad_dude123465> @gabesweetman he can’t charge during character selection in this game (in the earlier games he can) so it’s not as ridiculous as you might think
[1:01:53] <Guntanks_in_Space> don't drop your shield!
[1:01:54] <zenith0111> Not gonna lie I wish this game looked better
[1:01:55] <tigerfang86> pull the shield UP woolie
[1:01:57] <Serge_12> Who is the GUEST?
[1:01:58] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> That looks really stupid, please tell me there's a counter
[1:02:03] <%Wool> block
[1:02:12] <+floralkami> @GabeSweetMan in my opinion, not saying it's right, but i see it as someone entering the match already within a stance.
[1:02:14] <Guntanks_in_Space> you have to almost always expect him to have a Charge ready
[1:02:22] <Guntanks_in_Space> better pay attention to what button he ain't pressing
[1:02:26] <ManOfReason> nice
[1:02:28] <Guntanks_in_Space> at least, that's what i remember lol
[1:02:28] <%fFailureatlife> but why
[1:02:31] <%GingaNZ> explain yourself
[1:02:34] <$FuqBoiSlim> SeemsGood
[1:02:34] <%GabeSweetMan> @rad_dude123465 Ah gotcha. By the way Reggie was describing it sounded super busted.
[1:02:39] <Guntanks_in_Space> and now the Ara Ara happens
[1:02:42] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @Serge_12 Lord Jimmy Bones apparently
[1:03:02] <+floralkami> @GabeSweetMan plus, it's a risk/reward, giving up a button for potential high damge
[1:03:09] <Serge_12> OMG Jimmy Bones!!!! awesome!
[1:03:13] <Guntanks_in_Space> Woolie would Dropkick a Kid to not drown in tournament pools

[3:38:41] <StreakThunderstorm> 214 L
[3:38:42] <Sphincter_Spelunker> but is Sonichu in this
[3:38:42] <BwdYeti> Sega is generally good about fangames, so we're not too worried about it
[3:38:43] <StreakThunderstorm> M or H
[3:38:44] <heckengine> 100 % but just dont tell sega
[3:38:48] <dickbuttwoman> The breakdance he just did as a taunt
[3:38:58] <arkv01> @Smileyhat no c and d, segas cool
[3:38:59] <StreakThunderstorm> @WoolieVersus 214 L M or H, L is the fastest
[3:39:02] <+hitorio> I can just hear SonicFox's laugh while he's smothering you with disgusting mixups in this game

[3:39:32] <%gatorafan> @smileyhat always present but not 100% since SEGA sometimes is a pretty cool dude
[3:39:58] <StreakThunderstorm> SEGA likes fangames. We made this for the annual Sonic Fan Games Expo that has been going on for 20 years
[3:40:12] <+hitorio> Somehow GO1 would find a way to block everything for 5 minutes straight
[3:40:17] <+hitorio> and block unblockables
[3:40:18] <tacostarvedbeast> How can people make such good sonic games and Sega stuck in the Stone Age
[3:40:18] <Smileyhat> Yeah. I hope they stay cool with this, 'cause this game looks like a lot of fun.
[3:40:22] <+Gordon_Chow> considering the fact there are sonic fan game contests their probably fine
[3:40:25] <raveous> yeah sega's pretty damn good with fangames. I mean look at christian whitehead

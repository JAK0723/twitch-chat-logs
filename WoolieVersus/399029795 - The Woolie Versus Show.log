[0:42:48] <+Double_Tap_That> Who needs guard crush when you can have them crush themselves?
[0:42:49] <%Kavtech> Woolie seeks new victims.
[0:42:50] <alexandrecau> As long as no one showed up with a bow you should be fine
[0:42:50] <+Thorn14> This is Royal Guard the game
[0:42:58] <+JayEarly> The fact that you can watch them draw their last breath is some brutal ass shit

[0:45:49] <+Haarute> "Some guys will require multiple deathblows"
[0:45:49] <juicysal> Is Mr. Sekiro just extra short?
[0:45:51] <Dreamedlint> I just find parries so boring in general. Making it a central mechanic has me skeptical.
[0:45:51] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> They dont die when they are killed!
[0:45:52] <%yeknomlive> he's more like and elite
[0:45:55] <$cureneckbeard> He probably wouldn't die even if you killed him
[0:45:57] <@mothmandraws> also is this fate, people dont die
[0:45:57] <alexandrecau> He is already dead he just doesn'T know it
[0:45:57] <+GrassCannon> But people die when they are killed!

[0:58:00] <alexandrecau> didn't even try not making it creepy
[0:58:01] <prime_name> That's a pretty advanced Prosthetic for old timey Japan.
[0:58:02] <+Double_Tap_That> I love how he just permanently has ash on his face.
[0:58:05] <captainthunderwolf> Man, From fucking adores, "technically beatable first boss".
[0:58:06] <$megamonmon123> anything can be a dildo

[0:59:02] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Is that Akio Otsuka?
[0:59:04] <%PeaceCentennial> what a weird thing to say to someone you just met
[0:59:04] <%lewdskeletor13> Nico really let herself go
[0:59:05] <+AncientToco> Amazing that the two best games this year are both about cool amputee swordsmen
[0:59:05] <%kerotuyu> I'm ready for some BIONIC ARM
[0:59:06] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:59:06] <%RioGascar> His legs SCARE ME
[0:59:07] <Tizona824> This devil breaker needs a name
[0:59:10] <captainthunderwolf> It's almost tragic that DMC5 and Sekiro need to fight for GoTY. They both look like they'd win in separate years.
[0:59:13] <%PeaceCentennial> "you look like a fucking loser lol"
[0:59:13] <%RioGascar> WHATS WITH HIS LEGS
[0:59:19] <+Eclipse_knight_> pat is getting his shit pushed in
[0:59:21] <stormingryocan220> it's technically a medieval devil breaker but whit a curse
[0:59:21] <FutaSnek> HIS LIPS ARE MOVING PogChamp
[0:59:22] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Mrs. Dead Weight?
[0:59:27] <Thalchampz> SWEET SURRENDER
[0:59:29] <+jean_kirschtein_neigh> I heart Japanese voice acting
[0:59:31] <%PeoplesChimp> is it my wife!?
[0:59:35] <bignerb> dead weight san
[0:59:37] <captainthunderwolf> Now cut off the other arm and give me two!
[0:59:42] <UnderpaidBob> not gonna lie, this new arm is pretty sweet
[0:59:43] <+big_papa22> "Doc, this arm is sick. Take off my other limbs too"
[0:59:45] <jonlambert0001> Can I use it as a skateboard?
[0:59:49] <+Double_Tap_That> BUT HOW DOES IT WORK
[0:59:51] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 1 hour. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 4oz (120mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[0:59:54] <Graywolf_the_45th> we need to lose some more limbs, go full Hyakkimaru
[0:59:59] <+katarjin> @captainthunderwolf so teh Kenshi route
[1:00:00] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Double_Tap_That
[1:00:03] <+JayEarly> Stay hydrated woolie
[1:00:04] <captainthunderwolf> "I'm actually a leftie, so could I just have another?"
[1:00:05] <Doc1790> Oh my God
[1:00:09] <+majormilkshake95> Woolie we all know that Nero and Kyrie never got much further than hand holding.
[1:00:12] <+big_papa22> @WoolieVersus drink your water
[1:00:15] <tungstenviper> This voice acting is so cliche LUL
[1:00:16] <Doc1790> This is literally Devil May Cry V
[1:00:17] <CadmiumCore> I mean, cutting off all the other limbs is basically what Raiden does
[1:00:35] <captainthunderwolf> @majormilkshake95 Based on the vibrator arm, I'm sure he's held a few things on her.
[1:00:41] <Dragon_Batman> I think more like bring demon pieces get arms
[1:00:42] <@mothmandraws> he was going to eat you instead
[1:00:48] <captainthunderwolf> @katarjin Pretty much.
[1:00:49] <wirblewomble> woah, I forgot you talked
[1:00:49] <%Mofirelizard> seemsgood100 seemsgood100 seemsgood100 take my bits you weeb
[1:00:52] <SiegeJay> Chat! Would you cut off one of your arms for a Bionic arm?
[1:00:52] <NumberTooBig> @majormilkshake95 You mean Back massages Kappa
[1:00:53] <%DrWolpertinger> about a month give or take
[1:00:54] <prime_name> This game has an english dub, yeah?
[1:00:54] <%RioGascar> So is this games speed more like bloodborne
[1:00:55] <DSD24> Still lame that we never got to see Kyrie in DMC 5
[1:00:56] <+JayEarly> Thanks for making this sick cyborg arm mr hobo
[1:00:56] <captainthunderwolf> Yes.
[1:00:58] <WhereDoYouThinkWeAre> I can't believe this game ripped off DMCV's arm gear smh
[1:00:58] <+big_papa22> tes
[1:01:02] <+big_papa22> yes
[1:01:02] <%RioGascar> Or is it a return to slow souls
[1:01:06] <captainthunderwolf> I'd cut off someone else's arm for a Devil Breaker.
[1:01:06] <+OmegaZeroX2> @prime_name It does
[1:01:08] <WhereDoYouThinkWeAre> I can't believe this game ripped off MGSV's arm gear smh
[1:01:12] <Dragon_Batman> Yea there is a dub
[1:01:14] <%DrWolpertinger> the tree grows in the distance, the Quilthop
[1:01:15] <Sedrelic> SS?
[1:01:26] <hassanico> I don't think a dub would fit this game in particular
[1:01:28] <+jean_kirschtein_neigh> Sub is better than dub =)
[1:01:28] <+big_papa22> i can't believe mgsv ripped off bionic commando
[1:01:28] <AggsMK7> His Bankai
[1:01:29] <Sagata_> Update on pat death counter: 10
[1:01:30] <DSD24> Fear the Old Blood?
[1:01:31] <+Double_Tap_That> Fear the old blood
[1:01:33] <wirblewomble> Sekiro: the phantom pain
[1:01:33] <Dragon_Batman> Max was playing with it yesterday
[1:01:34] <hassanico> If it's like usual Souls ones
[1:01:36] <stormingryocan220> this the gaming ARMS era

[1:01:58] <captainthunderwolf> Congrats, protagonist! You've been cursed with immortality.
[1:02:05] <alexandrecau> he will continue a bloodline with his royal one
[1:02:06] <pigeontactician> moving mouths!
[1:02:08] <%RioGascar> anyone here able to say the overall speed of this game? I can never go back to slow souls after getting my fill of bloodborne
[1:02:11] <+Double_Tap_That> Now there needs to be a game where you lose your legs and get turbo mecha legs in return.
[1:02:12] <josemoya95> don't want to look, how is thw game so far?
[1:02:15] <%Sxy_T_Rex> looks like he's got some peanut butter in his mouth
[1:02:18] <Sarumarine> Moving mouth tech
[1:02:20] <captainthunderwolf> @RioGascar Fairly fast.
[1:02:26] <%RioGascar> Thank god
[1:02:27] <+aivalera> Every so often you can see V skating around on shadow in the distance, reading poetry
[1:02:31] <Parapattern> No the most detailed mouth movement
[1:02:32] <@mothmandraws> ive got a feeling fromsoft got fed up of item description stories and wanted to do an actual story
[1:02:34] <+big_papa22> "Doc, strap some rockets to my legs i wanna go fast"
[1:02:34] <wirblewomble> man, it's weird having dialogue options
[1:02:38] <UnderpaidBob> wow a From Software game where the mouths move
[1:02:47] <HorribleHog> They've upgraded from not moving mouths at all to fish mouths, nice!
[1:02:58] <cyrusvgz> PARTY IS OVER. それでも踊りたかった 眠れないくらい
[1:03:01] <shevan123> this game is bananas
[1:03:05] <+RockTB> Woolie green-screen as Sekiro when?
[1:03:09] <Sedrelic> bearer seek seek lest
[1:03:10] <%CEGold> @HorribleHog Any progress is progress Kappa
[1:03:17] <captainthunderwolf> Ah, you talk to the Buddha statue to unlock Super Saiyan 2.
[1:03:23] <$Tarcanist_> this game feel like dark souls and blodborne both jerked off into a turkey baster and impregnated Tenchu? @woolieversus
[1:03:23] <+Aeoneth> Secret Mission?
[1:03:34] <@mothmandraws> pretty
[1:03:34] <%CEGold> @RockTB Now I miss his Naruto run NotLikeThis
[1:03:35] <+asgard147> Talk to lady
[1:03:47] <ECRead> @cyrusvgz give me fire doodBro
[1:03:49] <+RockTB> Clearly we need to find Vergil and obtain his sword.
[1:03:50] <wirblewomble> hey, can there be a proper VOD of this?
[1:03:50] <captainthunderwolf> Talk to the Japanese woman named Emma.
[1:03:55] <thetruthofyourbeing> damn this looks so beautiful
[1:03:56] <+aivalera> So is March 2019 Woolie month? He’s got two games with royal guard in it.
[1:04:02] <%Sxy_T_Rex> that hut as a lot bands flyers all over it
[1:04:02] <Tizona824> Well, that and this isn't *exactly* a dark souls game, or even bloodborne. The utter lack of major rpg mechanics, no stamina, the focus on deflecting instead of dodging. It's a beast of its own.
[1:04:04] <josemoya95> impressions?
[1:04:04] <AggsMK7> Humanity?
[1:04:06] <hassanico> wait money?
[1:04:07] <cyrusvgz> <3 <3

[1:04:19] <%Cavumentum> "Normal"
[1:04:26] <Sedrelic> ""normal""
[1:04:32] <@mothmandraws> Mcdonalds wouldnt accept the souls of the defeated when I went last week
[1:04:35] <+RockTB> Souls! Err blood echoes! Err dosh bling!
[1:04:37] <%MeanGeneTheGodHand> @Tarcanist_ This game was literally a Tenchu game early in development.
[1:04:44] <%GohanEgret> @wirblewomble there is a VOD on the twitch videos tab, but the youtube stuff is the greatest hits video
[1:04:46] <%RioGascar> So is this fromsoft taking a stab at character action once more?
[1:04:48] <+OmegaZeroX2> @mothmandraws LUL
[1:04:48] <DSD24> Soul of a true hero

[1:05:03] <+Double_Tap_That> dafuq is unseen aid?
[1:05:05] <alexandrecau> for a tenchu doesn'T seem to be much stealth so far
[1:05:07] <+RockTB> @mothmandraws Taco Bell took 50 Echoes for a quesadilla last week.
[1:05:22] <captainthunderwolf> @Double_Tap_That It's like a Rare Ring of Sacrifice, but only sometimes.
[1:05:24] <%Sxy_T_Rex> @Double_Tap_That its a chance to lose nothing on death
[1:05:25] <%PeoplesChimp> remmber you have to press rest
[1:05:25] <hassanico> I thought this game wouldn't have levelling supposedly?
[1:05:35] <+OmegaZeroX2> @rocktb LUL
[1:05:38] <+thackattack00> it has a skill tree kinda
[1:05:42] <captainthunderwolf> @hassanico It's a very atypical system.
[1:05:42] <+thackattack00> not stat leveling
[1:05:46] <Dreamedlint> This game is just a code vein ripoff
[1:05:46] <%RioGascar> it probably doesnt, but it has moves to unlock
[1:05:57] <+Double_Tap_That> Bear seek seek lest

[1:07:03] <+OmegaZeroX2> @dreamedlint It didn’t
[1:07:05] <alexandrecau> fill my gourd
[1:07:09] <+Double_Tap_That> It's so weird having a talking character with this kind of game.
[1:07:11] <captainthunderwolf> Oh, that incorrect ellipse spacing really gets me.
[1:07:11] <SiegeJay> Get ready for Woolie's reaction to when he dies for the first time. This is not a Souls game
[1:07:12] <Lord_maxios> n a n i
[1:07:13] <Dragon_Batman> Doctor waifu?
[1:07:16] <captainthunderwolf> Oh, that's awful.
[1:07:23] <BestTeaMaker> did woolie already notice that they're lip synching?
[1:07:27] <+Bakatyler> Woolie, is this Game of the Year and should I forgo food for a week to buy this?
[1:07:30] <Dreamedlint> Its been so long!
[1:07:33] <AggsMK7> Kill her
[1:07:39] <Frostilk> really like the pacing of the dialogue
[1:07:48] <ManOfReason> LOL lord kuro that a good name
[1:07:52] <%RioGascar> i would say dmc5 or re2 are current game of the years
[1:07:53] <Vashido22> how's the game so far?
[1:07:54] <sdbzdb> can't pull out weapons here
[1:08:00] <captainthunderwolf> "In my land, 'Ireland', we call it an 'Estus Flask'."
[1:08:02] <%RioGascar> this ones too new to make the verdict
[1:08:03] <+theshinyhunterdom> a Souls game with storyline blasephemy
[1:08:04] <Shishi1205> Magic
[1:08:10] <Rawpost> @riogascar it was coming out last September but it got a random delay to 2019
[1:08:14] <BestTeaMaker> oh, you mean estus shards Kappa
[1:08:20] <+Bakatyler> @RioGascar I already have both of those. I need more GotYs!
[1:08:21] <+djinnJuice> no kidding
[1:08:25] <Vashido22> Finally fot my DMC5 copy! I can rock the party now?
[1:08:26] <+RockTB> Sekrio, take these BLOOD VIALS. They might heal you or something, I dunno. Inject them into your leg, or don't if you're a wuss.
[1:08:27] <Dreamedlint> Where's William?
[1:08:28] <%Sxy_T_Rex> I'm glad to find out gray hair just means I've received dragon heritage
[1:08:31] <Vashido22> YES I CAN
[1:08:35] <Shishi1205> The voice acting is top notch btw
[1:08:36] <%RioGascar> How pissed off do you think fromsoft is
[1:08:43] <BestTeaMaker> DRAGON'S HERITAGE IS AWESOME
[1:08:44] <%RioGascar> NO ITS NOT A SOUKS
[1:08:48] <@Solidus_113> is it a BRAND
[1:08:51] <Parapattern> OCELOT
[1:09:00] <+RockTB> Dark Bourne Sekiro Souls: Tenchu Edition.
[1:09:00] <%RioGascar> ITS NOT now HERES THE MOONLIGHT GREATSWORD for the 100th time
[1:09:02] <Pseudonymity> of course it's not souls, it's Tenchu
[1:09:10] <+D4C_Trice> I've heard that this game is pretty much sneak around and royal guard everything
[1:09:17] <Dreamedlint> No its Nioh
[1:09:17] <captainthunderwolf> "Just FYI, like one of your grandparents fucked a dragon. Anyway, don't die, you'll give random strangers AIDS."

[1:09:58] <%PeaceCentennial> oh shit it's this dude
[1:10:00] <Pseudonymity> heh Pat was just talking to this guy
[1:10:03] <%RioGascar> Like fromsoft is now the souls company
[1:10:04] <ToastyBroDude> DON'T TRY IT
[1:10:04] <%Kavtech> That guy's huge.
[1:10:06] <Tucker0603> THIS DUDE!
[1:10:06] <DSD24> Is Wolf like 5 foot 6?
[1:10:18] <AggsMK7> Well, he is Japanese
[1:10:18] <%RioGascar> if they try and do anything else they’ll get told NOOOOO DO SOULS
[1:10:19] <MZess> "dude, you just STINK of shinobi"
[1:10:23] <+RockTB> So, what is Sekiro's Stand?
[1:10:23] <+D4C_Trice> Pat's already screwed up his world state
[1:10:27] <Thalchampz> FACE ME IN THE FIELDS
[1:10:29] <+theshinyhunterdom> thicc boi angry
[1:10:30] <Vashido22> god the japanese voices help a lot
[1:10:31] <captainthunderwolf> @DSD24 It seems like he might actually be slightly short for the setting, yeah.
[1:10:34] <%PeaceCentennial> poor guy
[1:10:35] <Parapattern> BITCH
[1:10:40] <@mothmandraws> spooky
[1:10:50] <Thalchampz> WHY CAN'T I DIE THO
[1:10:51] <%PeaceCentennial> so welcome to your training dummy
[1:10:57] <BestTeaMaker> dude can't die, can never rip
[1:11:07] <Tucker0603> training dummy-san!
[1:11:10] <%Razputin217> Cursed Undead
[1:11:10] <Jontman42> A "curse", even
[1:11:13] <$cureneckbeard> pat and woolie are both fighting this guy at the same time
[1:11:14] <DSD24> @captainthunderwolf I figured it was like a Nioh situation where the protagonist could be tall but everyone is just WAY taller
[1:11:14] <BestTeaMaker> ashen one
[1:11:15] <+vtech325> combat's that quick?
[1:11:16] <Vashido22> Bearer of the curse
[1:11:17] <Shishi1205> Blade of the inmortal
[1:11:17] <wirblewomble> IT'S DArk SoULs
[1:11:17] <Doc1790> Bearer of The Curse
[1:11:20] <%Sxy_T_Rex> infested? is he just a bag of bugs?
[1:11:21] <+theshinyhunterdom> Not souls but people call us undead or cursed
[1:11:23] <Dreamedlint> Undead
[1:11:25] <@mothmandraws> woolie tell him about the bell of awakening
[1:11:32] <@mothmandraws> he could probably go do some cool stuff
[1:11:35] <%CEGold> I mean, being immortal sucks. Living threw the Earth getting swallowed up by the Sun? No thank you cmonBruh
[1:11:47] <%RioGascar> So how ufairly judged is that ghosts of tushima gonna get compared to this game. CAUSE BOY THESE SEEM REAL similar
[1:11:49] <BestTeaMaker> WHY WOULD ANYONE REFUSE
[1:11:57] <+Haarute> "just fuck me up, man"
[1:12:06] <AggsMK7> You still feel pain, bro
[1:12:08] <captainthunderwolf> @DSD24 It probably is, but I think it's a lot more interesting to image an action protag who isn't 9'6 and made out of ripcord steel. It would make sense for a shinobi to be small and agile. :)
[1:12:18] <%PeaceCentennial> THIS SONG
[1:12:24] <+linSP> just live long enough until they invent pain killers lol

[1:13:19] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:13:21] <coreybom> @riogascar To be fair, I think is ghost is gonna be more story based, like a kuroshawa film.
[1:13:25] <DSD24> @captainthunderwolf I can't imagine it being a good deal all the time though, I mean you will outlive anyone you are friends wit
[1:13:29] <Jontman42> Mada mada
[1:13:31] <DSD24> with
[1:13:32] <+thackattack00> Immortality is also a really bad deal for an undetermined, probably longer time afterwards
[1:13:38] <Dreamedlint> But can you iiai quickdraw?
[1:13:40] <%PeaceCentennial> @WoolieVersus do deflects feel easier than DS parries?
[1:13:42] <Rawpost> so apparently miyazaki wanted to keep references to previous titles to a minimum, so no moonlight greatsword
[1:13:48] <captainthunderwolf> @thackattack00 So is absolute nonexistence.
[1:13:50] <%RioGascar> Lies
[1:13:56] <$cureneckbeard> moonlight daikatana
[1:14:00] <%RioGascar> the moonlight greatsword is in every fromsoft game
[1:14:04] <captainthunderwolf> I'll take the one where I can still eat food and punch things.
[1:14:10] <%dr_shakalu87> dr_shakalu87 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:14:15] <%RioGascar> It HAS to be in here
[1:14:16] <@Solidus_113> do you even get new weapons in this game, or just new moves
[1:14:19] <+thackattack00> There wouldnt be anything left to eat or punch is what im saying
[1:14:23] <captainthunderwolf> @DSD24 Ah, that often happens by default.
[1:14:33] <%PeaceCentennial> oh man you got knocked down
[1:14:35] <Vashido22> @riogascar maybe DLC, like bloodborne
[1:14:37] <+aivalera> Roll dammit
[1:14:42] <alexandrecau> man later I hope som samurai start putting chainmail or something under the armpit becaus eof woolie's rep
[1:14:45] <Vashido22> the moonlight katana
[1:14:49] <captainthunderwolf> @thackattack00 Fool that you are, imagining a space madman wouldn't autocannibalize as he floated in the void.
[1:14:51] <Self_esteampunk> us peasants have to wait until tomorrow to play /:
[1:15:00] <%RioGascar> If you cant pick up weapons then theres gonna be a boss with the moonlight greatsword
[1:15:07] <AggsMK7> i frames
[1:15:09] <+majormilkshake95> @Solidus_113 From what I understand you get new prosthetic weapons but you keep the same katana throughout the game. There are upgrade trees for moves.
[1:15:09] <Vashido22> ^
[1:15:22] <+Zeemod155> mada mada
[1:15:26] <DSD24> I have so much blood in my neck you don't even know
[1:15:33] <+JayEarly> hurt me moreeeeeee Wolf
[1:15:45] <%CEGold> @majormilkshake95 So you're saying that we might get a Moonlight Great Prosthetic? PogChamp Kappa
[1:15:46] <captainthunderwolf> @DSD24 This man keeps entire blood banks in those arteries, just in case.
[1:15:54] <%RioGascar> Are animations and attacks cancelable?
[1:15:55] <+ElMemeKing> HMM
[1:16:00] <wirblewomble> so is this when he reveals za warudo?
[1:16:01] <%RioGascar> Or are you locked in for a lot of them?
[1:16:07] <+majormilkshake95> @CEGold If it were to be anything I'd hope so.
[1:16:09] <Parapattern> HUrt me, daddy wolfie
[1:16:14] <Vashido22> aw
[1:16:15] <+ElMemeKing> when is naruto gonna show up :(

[1:24:59] <%Sxy_T_Rex> @WoolieVersus you can do deathblows from jumping but there is no indicator before jumping, you have to jump towards the enemy and time the attack

[1:31:04] <%MeanGeneTheGodHand> Just how viable is stealth in this game? Because...well...I DO love me some Tenchu.

[1:31:17] <BestTeaMaker> if the mangaka won't finish Vagabond, the Woolie will live it through this game
[1:31:17] <Pillagius> @teflonbilly777 but corgis are cute! Why would anyone try to kill... Ooooh!.. Oh Miyazaki you cunning monster!

[1:32:31] <%Cavumentum> We are FIGHTING DREAMERS
[1:32:39] <%PeoplesChimp> woolie already forgets his grapple buddy
[1:32:42] <Kingdomgene> @MeanGeneTheGodHand Stealth is probably possibles but there are sections where you have to just go out and fight it out
[1:32:53] <Dragon_Batman> Shortcuts nice
[1:32:56] <%ofloofy> I sure hope this game has Japanese skeleton warriors in some form
[1:32:59] <%Kavtech> That sounds useful.
[1:33:00] <AggsMK7> Favorites are always nice
[1:33:18] <AMutePlays> what kinda ninja game can't be full stealth, barring assassinations?
[1:33:19] <alixthemighty> latent skills are passives
[1:33:20] <RoboXGP> you slaughter dogs in this game, they're completely powerless
[1:33:21] <%dukenux> @ofloofy Those giant ones that eat people
[1:33:22] <The12thMonkey> No more reading SMOrc
[1:33:23] <teflonbilly777> Dammit, I still haven't played The Surge or Nioh and now this comes out. And then Nioh 2 and Ghosts Of Tsushima keep the samurai train tolling. It's an embaressment of riches!
[1:33:25] <AMutePlays> more samurai than anything
[1:33:25] <+BurncoatRapscallion> I can't wait to not be able to read those loading screens on PC
[1:33:27] <stormingryocan220> This is literally Ninja Guiden if it was made by From Software
[1:33:29] <%dukenux> atleast i hope so
[1:33:46] <kiraellion> the surge had samurai?
[1:33:49] <Doc1790> Cash First
[1:33:50] <AggsMK7> Are you saying Ninja Gaiden ain't ninja?
[1:33:53] <+Dickship> This game seems to have a good amount of qol features
[1:33:55] <AutechreTwinAphex> are certain sections only explorable by bonfire warping or is it like Dark Souls 1?
[1:33:57] <+blastazoid26> into a [TUSK]
[1:33:58] <SiegeJay> @stormingryocan220 It is Tenchu. From Software made Ninja games before
[1:34:05] <TheAtlus> Yeah Tenchu
[1:34:13] <$GoogleyGareth> Love these voice actors
[1:34:17] <teflonbilly777> @kiraellion Nah, it was just Soulslikey. I enjoyed what I tried of it though
[1:34:17] <+Jordan_z123> Come in and see woolie with the Japanese audio man of taste
[1:34:24] <DSD24> Some kind of Bio Curse?
[1:34:28] <Shishi1205> Poor english VCs
[1:34:28] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:34:32] <+Thorn14> OMOSHIO
[1:34:39] <stormingryocan220> Never heard of Tenchu
[1:34:40] <%too_effing_old> He only has one arm as well?
[1:34:47] <+Thorn14> Yep
[1:34:47] <%MeanGeneTheGodHand> @Kingdomgene Cool, that's fine. I'm just hoping I can use stealth at least a good chunk of the time. Never expected to go 100% stealth.
[1:34:48] <AggsMK7> Does he need a prosthetic?
[1:34:52] <@mothmandraws> why doesnt he make himself one
[1:34:52] <+blastazoid26> What is a tenchu?
[1:34:54] <@mothmandraws> he could work faster
[1:34:55] <Shishi1205> I think the arm you get is his actual arm
[1:35:01] <%dukenux> In DS it was english, but here im sure i'll play subbed
[1:35:02] <+Thorn14> Tenchu is a PS1 and PS2 era stealth ninja game
[1:35:05] <teflonbilly777> I'm in the middle of Son Of Sparda dammit, I don't have time for another amazing game!
[1:35:06] <mrgrimsmiles> regular ones you say
[1:35:06] <Sarumarine> 'to take to the air' huh
[1:35:08] <+blastazoid26> ah
[1:35:09] <+Thorn14> This game was going to be a new Tenchu
[1:35:15] <mrgrimsmiles> whats the weird ones
[1:35:15] <+Thorn14> but they decided to make it be Sikiro instead
[1:35:18] <Key2Destiny> GUN
[1:35:19] <Shishi1205> But by what he says it doesn't help him carve budhas so it gave it to you
[1:35:22] <%dukenux> Ninja Soulsbornechu
[1:35:26] <+Thorn14> but there's a LOT of Tenchu in this game, like when you lean against a wall
[1:35:27] <%MeanGeneTheGodHand> I'm gonna miss Rikimaru.
[1:35:28] <%ChoculaUltra> so the dude ISN'T Rikimaru?! dag!
[1:35:32] <stormingryocan220> Mm might look into that later
[1:35:33] <+Thorn14> I would kill for a Rikimaru skin
[1:35:38] <%MeanGeneTheGodHand> Same.
[1:35:43] <Kingdomgene> @MeanGeneTheGodHand Yup, take what I say with a grain of salt any knowledge I have from the game is just from watching streamers so I don't know for sure
[1:35:45] <teflonbilly777> I loved Tenchu on PS1. I remember getting it after MGS1 when I was aching for more stealth gameplay and Syphon Filter had dissapointed me severely
[1:35:47] <TheAtlus> @Thorn14 Oh totally
[1:35:48] <+thackattack00> i want a shitty ps1 model rikimaru skin
[1:35:49] <%dukenux> angry Buddha doesn't sound right
[1:35:56] <SiegeJay> WOOLIE just unlocked GUN! Gun! GUN!
[1:36:12] <%Kavtech> "When you try" not "if," that's interesting.

[1:37:03] <arfsm95> @WoolieVersus the prosthetic, it's a joke

[1:37:05] <KeroKamina> gun-royal-gun-royal-gun-royal-gun-royal-gun
[1:37:10] <stormingryocan220> This game makes you use BLOOD as a stealth mechanic
[1:37:23] <@mothmandraws> will woolie get the actual favourite weapon of samurai
[1:37:27] <@mothmandraws> matchlock rifles
[1:37:34] <teflonbilly777> First Venom Snake, then Nero and now Wolf. It's the year of losing arms you guys!

[1:38:12] <teflonbilly777> I count Venom Snake because MGS V isn't over dammit! Part 3 is coming!
[1:38:18] <@mothmandraws> rifles in sengoku jidai period were cool
[1:38:33] <%MeanGeneTheGodHand> Yeah. They thought so, too.
[1:38:39] <Shishi1205> Does the game have multiplayer?
[1:38:40] <teflonbilly777> INSIGHT!?
[1:38:42] <Dragon_Batman> I imagine the arm is like half the core gameplay

[2:03:59] <JanusII> You're going at a pretty good pace.
[2:03:59] <Nitsuj293> lytTHUMBSUP
[2:03:59] <simulationbard> Woolie is figuring it out
[2:04:11] <prime_name> The 20 minutes was an issue for people?
[2:04:12] <$vectorcannonready> Woolie is a man amoung Mihn
[2:04:12] <%CEGold> Had to get my multi stream set up
[2:04:13] <Cuboid64> the 20 minutes reminds me of the classic SA LPs
[2:04:14] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Dude, you're killing it @WoolieVersus
[2:04:16] <teflonbilly777> I'll be tehre for you Wollie *Friends clap*

[2:04:29] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @prime_name during the menu surfing, yeah.
[2:04:30] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> Woolie pulled a SSoHPKC with that DMC Netflix-style drop
[2:04:33] <Ebisrator> Your the best bro, the fact that you still upload lets plays is great.
[2:04:34] <Shishi1205> The disease that plagues the npcs when you die is called dragon Rot, you can heal it
[2:04:39] <soulkarl> but did you beat dmc5
[2:04:43] <sodapopSquid> Woolie you need some framed art on your walls you petal sleeved FUCK.

[2:05:48] <eddiemayfly> @Jpdodds Technically, it's wood, rope, steel and bone.
[2:05:49] <alexandrecau> jump what madness
[2:05:54] <@Menitta> Oh cool it's not some dumb button for jump
[2:06:01] <@Menitta> Like R1
[2:06:05] <Iwashi94> anyone has any info on PC optimization?
[2:06:19] <%SilvaChariot0133> Pat's been running it like Souls and getting manhandled for it
[2:06:28] <Dragon_Batman> LUL You can also switch the controls
[2:06:32] <@Menitta> Well theres a PC resetera thread I could send you to Kappa
[2:06:34] <+thackattack00> seems to run near perfectly from what i saw on Max's stream @Iwashi94
[2:06:35] <LegendaryDorkKnight> funny thing that bothers me is that grappling hooks don't work like that
[2:06:35] <Not_A_Bot_Really> I cant believe that this was already pirated LUL
[2:06:39] <+moranprime> That is one huge chicken
[2:06:42] <eddiemayfly> @Iwashi94 If you're asking the specs of this game, it's literally the same as DS3.
[2:06:49] <@Menitta> Man that Grapple looks fucking fun
[2:06:49] <slatersev> pft
[2:06:50] <AggsMK7> LUL

[2:06:57] <roguestormtrooper> LUL
[2:07:03] <pandangerous> amazing LUL
[2:07:05] <+ESP_ROOT> not a real gamer Pepega
[2:07:08] <%Sxy_T_Rex> The Surge that soda game?
[2:07:12] <+liquidzr0> the hottest take on twitch
[2:07:13] <@mothmandraws> the surge is the dark souls of souls
[2:07:13] <Dingo_Eejit> It's a legit answer
[2:07:17] <baronvonbirman> bitterShook was not prepared to hear that minh
[2:07:17] <gustavozxd> and then NIOH you can fucking triple your stamina with the pulse
[2:07:20] <@Menitta> I get that. I only like Bloodborne tbh
[2:07:21] <mrgrimsmiles> yet you play teh surge
[2:07:21] <+TransporterX7> FUCK em Mihn rock the perfect guard
[2:07:21] <+HostilePoundcakes> NotLikeThis
[2:07:23] <mrgrimsmiles> really
[2:07:24] <grayjammer> The Surge ain’t bad
[2:07:26] <Doc1790> "Really dark"
[2:07:28] <teflonbilly777> Billy loves Kirby
[2:07:31] <$ooblagis> Mihn the Anti-Berserk Hater
[2:07:34] <Dragon_Batman> Woolie started in a similar fashion
[2:07:34] <+Taglog7> Naruto's pretty dark
[2:07:39] <SomersaultJustice> Kirby's pretty sick tho
[2:07:40] <+moranprime> Would Billy be into Armored Core?
[2:07:41] <mrgrimsmiles> that game is dark with the first cutscence man
[2:07:43] <Jakeofalco> my friend gives the same excuse
[2:07:58] <arfsm95> @WoolieVersus hey, when you get to "firelink" again, there's a tutorial guy, i higly advise to go there, since it gives tutorials that the game take a long time to give
[2:08:01] <$GoogleyGareth> oof the frames
[2:08:11] <+venisonboar> Billy is freaking hilarious.
[2:08:14] <gustavozxd> only reason I didn't enjoy ds was the combat, everything else was enjoyable
[2:08:16] <AggsMK7> I hope you get a grappling yank
[2:08:23] <CerberusDriver> caw caw
[2:08:23] <Kaitepaints> Oh no, this lady
[2:08:31] <+moranprime> I want to play Shadow Tower.
[2:08:39] <Parapattern> It's not Hard, it's challenging
[2:08:40] <AggsMK7> The Dark Souls of X
[2:08:40] <+DreyfussFrost> Souls games aren't NES difficult, but they're VERY difficult by modern standards.
[2:08:41] <SomersaultJustice> Is <<thing>> the dark souls of <thing>
[2:08:42] <Dragon_Batman> It's more like artificial difficulty
[2:08:48] <+thewaifoo> getting hella South East asian vibes from my homie billy
[2:08:48] <bignerb> its the dark souls of blank
[2:08:50] <tacoisgoods> this is the dark souls of woolie streams
[2:08:53] <gustavozxd> the meme? calling Spyro the dragon to dark souls for example
[2:09:03] <Shishi1205> Woolie you forgot to loot by sucC
[2:09:06] <sodapopSquid> The reason that meme exists is because Game Journalists are stupid
[2:09:06] <simulationbard> Is Sekiro the Dark Souls of japan
[2:09:08] <AggsMK7> Top Tier
[2:09:11] <%CEGold> "Sekiro is the dark souls of Tenchu"
[2:09:11] <gustavozxd> something someone actually unironically did
[2:09:11] <Dragon_Batman> It's become a joke now mostly
[2:09:13] <NeonBleu> The Dark Souls of FromSoft
[2:09:14] <+SilverDevilfish> 死
[2:09:15] <a_mad_dragon> SMT is the Dark Souls of Pokemon Kappa
[2:09:19] <+RowenCleric> LUL
[2:09:21] <+thewaifoo> Shadows Die Thrice??
[2:09:21] <CerberusDriver> I had the dark souls of bowel movements
[2:09:23] <Fiendmaw> oof
[2:09:23] <%Kavtech> You mean L2 and L1?
[2:09:32] <$Tarcanist_> minh it's a commonly used term that is incorrect
[2:09:33] <SomersaultJustice> Fang's favorite game
[2:09:37] <FunkyStreams> Woolie finish your goddamn statement
[2:09:40] <Doc1790> This stream is the Dark Souls of Chicken Murder
[2:09:42] <pleochronic> i get the joke but SMT isnt fair at all in comparison to dark souls
[2:09:45] <$cureneckbeard> 死
[2:09:46] <$ooblagis> It's not THAT hard, but it will not allow you to brute force your way through by being bad and hitting your head against the wall like most games will. The only way to progress is in fact "git gud"
[2:09:46] <Shishi1205> You need to be in stealth for that jump execute woolie @WoolieVersus
[2:09:47] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:09:47] <mongol_800> @WoolieVersus You're a brave man for playing this without "subs only mode" LUL

[2:10:12] <NicLuvin> Damn Big man wasn't playing around LUL
[2:10:14] <Dragon_Batman> That was a late dodge dam
[2:10:15] <AFoolishPaper> DEDEDESTRUCTION
[2:10:16] <CerberusDriver> The tracking on that bonk tho
[2:10:16] <tag545> tracking overhead
[2:10:16] <+Taglog7> tmtBOOTY
[2:10:16] <AllenDeadman> dodge less, block more
[2:10:16] <%kerotuyu> Dude just turned you into mochi
[2:10:24] <arfsm95> @WoolieVersus hey, when you get to "firelink" again, there's a tutorial guy, i higly advise to go there, since it gives tutorials that the game take a long time to give
[2:10:25] <$cureneckbeard> 死
[2:10:31] <gustavozxd> un resurrected
[2:10:37] <@mothmandraws> just roll + parry = win dark souls
[2:10:39] <+thackattack00> @arfsm95 He's already been to tutorial guy
[2:10:41] <FunkyStreams> yes
[2:10:51] <gustavozxd> woolie explaining SNES games
[2:10:53] <SiegeJay> Dragon Rot is gonna suck
[2:10:54] <FunkyStreams> differing degrees of it in different games
[2:10:54] <glorioushedonist> Oh shit its ex billy
[2:11:00] <+ahegotrigger> that does make sense
[2:11:07] <SiegeJay> I really hate the Dragon Rot Mechanic
[2:11:08] <Dragon_Batman> It came at a time where games really told you how to play alot
[2:11:10] <arfsm95> @thackattack00 i see, he knows about the dive kick then?
[2:11:12] <gustavozxd> although back then they expected you to learn by reading the manual
[2:11:29] <bignerb> dark souls are just punishing games, your mistakes are big mistakes
[2:11:35] <FunkyStreams> every game has a challenge sure but Dark Souls and games like DiRT etc. are very challenging and you have to find your own style to succeed
[2:11:39] <gustavozxd> dragon rot only happens if you resurrect right?
[2:11:40] <MrGarettLefebvre> That PS4 pro performance though
[2:11:46] <Parapattern> Sneak Woolie!
[2:11:47] <%juxtest> Dont forget stealth mode
[2:11:53] <sodapopSquid> SMT is easier than pokemon because I never had to 6IV Mothman
[2:11:56] <eddiemayfly> @gustavozxd Only when you die die.
[2:11:56] <zepelinnn> thats a fuck uo lol
[2:12:20] <soulkarl> correct - darksouls difficulty is just genesis era
[2:12:25] <+DreyfussFrost> Fromsoft's games aren't even as hard as those old games.
[2:12:32] <+moranprime> Does SMT have IVs?
[2:12:40] <Dragon_Batman> It's a hard thing to explain
[2:12:47] <SiegeJay> @gustavozxd Yup! Its suppose to make you wary of using the Second life mechanic. A mechanic to not use a Mechanic... WTF SwiftRage
[2:12:48] <+thackattack00> @arfsm95 mm, I didn't see him do the tutorial for a divekick, but I'm pretty sure he did everything available when he first got there. Does he have more tutorials as you get farther?
[2:12:51] <NumberTooBig> @moranprime no, it has Mitamas that are pure stat boosts
[2:12:56] <+TheWittyWalrus> Does anyone know if this playthrough will be uploaded to yt?
[2:12:56] <+moranprime> Ahhhh.
[2:13:01] <%ChoculaUltra> shhh, don't tell people that Dark Souls is 3D Castlevania, they'll debate you into a coma
[2:13:02] <%oktavia_von> oktavia_von subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:13:19] <Shishi1205> Actual enemy step
[2:13:19] <arfsm95> @thackattack00 yeah, that are some precious tutorials that you don't actually see
[2:13:23] <JanusII> You actually can.
[2:13:30] <pleochronic> might i boost digital devil saga whilst SMT is being mentioned
[2:13:40] <arfsm95> @thackattack00 or the game takes a long time to show you
[2:13:43] <$cureneckbeard> Dark Souls is rewarding because it relies on player-acquired skill. You don't get good by grinding, but rather by learning, so when you succeed you feel like you did it.
[2:13:44] <+thackattack00> @arfsm95 ahhh i see
[2:13:44] <$vectorcannonready> Enemy step?
[2:13:48] <gustavozxd> @pleochronic yes PogChamp
[2:13:53] <DSD24> When are we going to get SMT5 news
[2:13:58] <DSD24> Its been so long
[2:14:02] <zepelinnn> @DSD24 not soon enough
[2:14:03] <gustavozxd> I'm currently going through strange journey and boy that soundtrack
[2:14:14] <zepelinnn> @gustavozxd redux?

[2:14:16] <shevan123> SICK

[2:14:21] <gustavozxd> yeah redux
[2:14:22] <%CEGold> PogChamp
[2:14:24] <glorioushedonist> rekt
[2:14:38] <Finakala> Man this game looks good
[2:14:38] <zepelinnn> @gustavozxd enhoy it, its a great game, neutral for life
[2:14:39] <+Shadicara> Man this is legit just peasant vergil
[2:14:41] <+ESP_ROOT> those hammer dudes are tough
[2:14:50] <Psifonian> How does gamplay stack up to Ni Oh?
[2:15:01] <+ESP_ROOT> not comparable imo
[2:15:03] <CerberusDriver> you know Vergil would play this game, hes a huge weeb.
[2:15:13] <+zetaplus> they are very different from each other
[2:15:26] <arfsm95> @WoolieVersus that are some new tutorials at the guy in "firelink"
[2:15:28] <gustavozxd> @zepelinnn hell yeah, so far I'm about to beat the second boss, first boss is actually kiryu which is pretty funny
[2:15:29] <SiegeJay> I have not seen any yet but does anyone know if there are 'Takedown Immune' Enemies
[2:15:39] <glorioushedonist> woolie should do a thing with pokemon blue
[2:15:49] <%Klefth> Tsushima, not tsukushima
[2:16:02] <+moranprime> Samurai games coming back. We just need Onimusha on RE Engine to rustle our jimmies.
[2:16:08] <KylinAli> ghost is pretty but idk about how the combat looks
[2:16:17] <KylinAli> im still gonna get it tho
[2:16:23] <DSD24> I hope the Protag in SMT 5 is cool we need another one like Demi Fiend
[2:16:24] <+zetaplus> ghost is nice looking but the combat doesn't appeal to me
[2:16:31] <+RowenCleric> Ghost also looks much much more Kurosawa

[2:19:46] <eddiemayfly> @FunkyStreams Definitive no.
[2:19:51] <%SilvaChariot0133> It's still a thing
[2:19:59] <FunkyStreams> thats actually good to hear
[2:20:03] <Dragon_Batman> I think the game would be unreasonably annoying if that were the case
[2:20:07] <TlS197> no fall damage ten bucks say everyone will still act as if fall damage is a thing in this game

[2:24:42] <glorioushedonist> attack
[2:24:43] <TlS197> she could probably see you talking to him right now
[2:24:43] <gustavozxd> well it IS a from soft game, so the VA is definitely the quality you'd expect
[2:24:46] <+thackattack00> Yeah but default is Japanese voices

[2:36:18] <@mothmandraws> guns suck at shooting into the water
[2:36:19] <spacecatstreams> woolie you should look up noodling
[2:36:20] <a_mad_dragon> you can fish with DYNAMITE
[2:36:22] <+thunderhog> Fishing is just a form of hunting.
[2:36:24] <FunkyStreams> I dont know of a type of fkatana swimmer fishing
[2:36:32] <Dragon_Batman> Dyna-mite
[2:36:33] <TlS197> @WoolieVersus there is a sport called moddling where people will you there fingers as bait and catch fish with their bare hands
[2:36:38] <+thunderhog> Does it kill and harvest fish? it's fishing
[2:36:39] <%Sxy_T_Rex> @spacecatstreams noodling is the shit
[2:36:44] <$Punisher7771> @a_mad_dragon yes and its fun as hell
[2:36:52] <@mothmandraws> is it fishing if you use stands
[2:37:00] <tag545> noodling. just shove your hand in the fish and pull
[2:37:02] <@Menitta> The weak fish should fear the strong
[2:37:04] <+D4C_Trice> What about suplexing catfish?
[2:37:05] <glorioushedonist> is pat ahead?
[2:37:06] <$Punisher7771> ... was 2b fishing?

[2:37:24] <Dragon_Batman> Pod fishing
[2:37:32] <Owkono> is this good?

[3:01:06] <arfsm95> @WoolieVersus once you get the two starters, the other show up
[3:01:15] <Dragon_Batman> That sounds dope
[3:01:16] <Valask> the font though, it's so Dark souls LUL
[3:01:17] <+LastHazzerd> this is just "shinobi arts"
[3:01:30] <arfsm95> @WoolieVersus like, when every vertical line completed show others
[3:01:31] <squidpeanut> So is this snailkiro?
[3:01:32] <GiveMoneyToVolta> Shinobi and the Dragon Ninja?
[3:01:33] <heckingjen> we still need Dino Arats and RPD Arts

[3:01:45] <heckingjen> Mystic Force Arts
[3:02:34] <$Ralfclogs> cheer100 I think your true stand would be "Kirbys" instead of pixies. Summoning harvest levels of Kirbys would be pretty overpowered
[3:02:49] <%Sxy_T_Rex> the slide can also dodge projectiles and it is epic looking

[3:07:45] <Shishi1205> I don't think he has played enough yakuzies
[3:07:59] <+thackattack00> afaik he's never played any of them
[3:08:01] <FunkyStreams> what seperates you from the enemy is vitality and posture
[3:08:08] <FunkyStreams> ...and being able to die twice
[3:08:48] <arfsm95> @WoolieVersus see how his posture bar is red? that's because it recovers slowly, it's good against high health bosses
[3:08:56] <Shishi1205> Im pretty sure you can kill them both ways

[3:09:28] <black_mages_matter_> POSTURE BOISE
[3:09:29] <FunkyStreams> or thrice
[3:09:33] <Shishi1205> Posture is more or less like Poise
[3:09:37] <FunkyStreams> 4 5 6 wtc
[3:09:53] <Videogamer4> posture is like defense
[3:10:00] <$cureneckbeard> don't drop your shield woolie
[3:10:10] <larrata20> you can totally kill things by lowering vitality. take the wolves for example
[3:10:25] <larrata20> slash once, whoops dead
[3:10:25] <%barkon345> you can raise there posture significantly by parrying

[3:10:57] <arfsm95> @WoolieVersus with your skill, try to dodge into the hit

[3:16:57] <gigacanuck> Woolie, if you were immortal, would you master the arts of combat IRL?
[3:17:02] <gustavozxd> yeah woolie is right
[3:17:04] <%barkon345> @WoolieVersus how lenient is the parry window in this game?
[3:17:09] <Shishi1205> Woolie would be a martial fiend
[3:17:10] <@Menitta> You want immortality with the option to take a bullet too
[3:17:11] <@Menitta> Yeah
[3:17:11] <FunkyStreams> just like youre awake for a very small percent of your life immortality i figure would work the same way
[3:17:13] <Finakala> Eventually, Cars stopped thinking
[3:17:14] <+Konquerer> i'd take a 10,000 year extension
[3:17:16] <saturnianocean> I'm just afraid of dying

[3:17:51] <%Thetulev> @WoolieVersus if you're immortal wouldn't you spend that time to learn to build a spaceship and leave Earth before that happened?
[3:17:54] <%Sxy_T_Rex> they dont taste immortal
[3:17:57] <+solzan2000> interesting
[3:17:58] <GiveMoneyToVolta> Lobsters?
[3:17:59] <gigacanuck> @cureneckbeard there can only be one....
[3:18:00] <GiveMoneyToVolta> Who?
[3:18:00] <@Menitta> You just dont wanna be Kars'd
[3:18:01] <FunkyStreams> lest you be on a different one
[3:18:03] <+combomaniadeluxe> thats nuts

[3:18:06] <GiveMoneyToVolta> Are we talking about lobsters?
[3:18:26] <bearwagon> i remember that episode of Justice League
[3:18:28] <%Thetulev> so explore the stuff you havent seen.
[3:18:29] <+solzan2000> you would go insane
[3:18:31] <Frostilk> Apathy would kill the mind at some point
[3:18:34] <FunkyStreams> it takes a very specific mindset and upbringing and so many different things for one to want to invent a spaceship
[3:18:38] <black_mages_matter_> i'm exhausted of living now in my 20s, fuck living for 200,000 years
[3:18:39] <%Thetulev> I've never seen a planet made of diamonds
[3:18:40] <gustavozxd> I would also want AT LEAST like 4 or 5 people that I could hang out with that are also immortal with me
[3:18:42] <@Menitta> I like that outlook on life.
[3:18:42] <+solzan2000> all your friends would be dead
[3:18:45] <ManOfReason> peace out
[3:18:46] <gigacanuck> well yeah, but he's getting old, if you were immortal you'd be young forever

[3:21:31] <black_mages_matter_> unfortunately for him, you only died once, but shadows die twice
[3:21:33] <+gessho> so is this a stealth game or a bloodborn game?
[3:21:42] <%Wintermute_VRC> both
[3:21:57] <Shishi1205> Kill 5 enemies or a miniboss @WoolieVersus
[3:22:02] <+LastHazzerd> no?
[3:22:08] <+mickers> i do wish this game had different armours and swords, even if they were just cosmetic
[3:22:14] <Videogamer4> this game is like bloodborne with the mentality of the blocking and parrying of ds1
[3:22:24] <+LastHazzerd> feast or famine baby
[3:22:25] <+Shotgundam009> Nice
[3:22:30] <Videogamer4> PogChamp
[3:22:40] <%barkon345> why are the enemies posture meters so small?
[3:22:47] <+gessho> cool thanks
[3:23:10] <+gessho> I asked that in pats chat and all I got blasted with was "IT'S NOT A SOULS GAME STOP PIGEON HOLING IT"
[3:23:12] <Shishi1205> You will know when you can revive when the black brush line is gone
[3:23:14] <+Shotgundam009> !
[3:23:14] <%barkon345> @Videogamer4 more parrying then blocking
[3:23:19] <T_Sasquatch> i feel like you could easily trivialise this game by playing like a complete coward
[3:23:28] <rempai1> game looks fucking good
[3:23:37] <GreyFoxHoundDD> Big poise for big bois
[3:23:42] <+OblivionSword1> woolie crpuching makes you harder to get spotted
[3:23:43] <Videogamer4> @barkon345 true
[3:23:43] <Shishi1205> You also have 2 different ways to revive, the rest in a budha circle and the kill enough enemies circle
[3:23:47] <jorgeniev> ninjas were the coolest of cowards
[3:23:49] <%Wintermute_VRC> the sound effects are so good, it must feel really meaty when you deathblow
[3:23:58] <Videogamer4> stab that old lady
[3:24:12] <gustavozxd> he changed to Japanese?
[3:24:30] <Royal8383> how many shadows have died making this game
[3:24:31] <+ChristianStubs> does this run at 60 on PS4 slim?
[3:24:34] <Shishi1205> If you have revived once Im not sure if you can get it back without resting? Not sure, can't remeber what Vati said
[3:24:41] <jorgeniev> you did a good thing woolie
[3:24:46] <reiju_22> did anyone try the english va? is it good?
[3:24:47] <%Sxy_T_Rex> @ChristianStubs no
[3:24:50] <Shishi1205> If anyone can double check
[3:25:02] <Videogamer4> you can get back review by killing enemies @shishi1205
[3:25:02] <JanusII> Dub is alright.
[3:25:10] <Videogamer4> revies*
[3:25:12] <Dragon_Batman> Max was playing a good bit of it in dub it sounded pretty good
[3:25:14] <Shishi1205> then i remembered correctly
[3:25:16] <Royal8383> @reiju_22 Max was playin it last night. Didn't sound bad.
[3:25:23] <%Sxy_T_Rex> none fo the consoles run at 60fps
[3:25:38] <Videogamer4> PogChamp
[3:25:38] <+LastHazzerd> there's a chance to receive revival essence from deathblowing enemies, similar to spirit emblems
[3:25:42] <+ChristianStubs> oh wow, pc it is then

[3:27:09] <+ill_sage> does the jump have i-frames?
[3:27:12] <vicviper_t301> That guy was from Bloodborne
[3:27:23] <jorgeniev> that canon guy actually has a move set
[3:27:30] <%juxtest> Oh no there must be aBlighttown
[3:27:46] <+LastHazzerd> poison? in a FromSoft game??
[3:27:53] <Videogamer4> from what I've seen of gameplay dodging doesn't have that many I frames so it's recommended to block more
[3:27:53] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:27:55] <Shishi1205> There's at least 3 status things, fire, poison and terror

[3:28:55] <+Konquerer> as much fun as pat getting DESTROYED is i appreciate woolie actually learning things
[3:29:13] <Videogamer4> pat is eating shit rn? LUL
[3:29:23] <gigacanuck> a wise decision
[3:29:25] <squidpeanut> He's getting bodied
[3:29:26] <%barkon345> and blocking causes your posture to go up so your better off just parrying
[3:29:29] <+Konquerer> he just got a flaming elbow from something
[3:29:31] <Dragon_Batman> Yea Pat is eating the poo pop
[3:29:32] <+bicboichavo> is he playing on PC or ps4?
[3:29:36] <Royal8383> Dmc5 and this make march the best month Ive been alive this year

[3:30:05] <+thunderhog> forgot minh was color blind
[3:30:07] <%CEGold> Just like Max LUL
[3:30:09] <JanusII> That can kill you though.
[3:30:12] <alexandrecau> pat figured that 2 seconds in
[3:30:15] <+LastHazzerd> the circle has to be FULL
[3:30:24] <+Konquerer> pat is going in hard and getting wrecked
[3:30:25] <+roxikat> Pat is playing on PS4 but will later play it on PC
[3:30:26] <$cureneckbeard> He fell off the cliff when I ran away from him!
[3:30:43] <Dragon_Batman> Probably not there
[3:30:51] <+OblivionSword1> is there any color blind mode
[3:30:59] <%CEGold> Maybe it will be modded in on the PC
[3:31:02] <+MrMcCrabby> @WoolieVersus the outer circle also completes when its grapple-able
[3:31:05] <+roxikat> Blood type personality mode
[3:31:17] <Videogamer4> I apreciate woolie is taking his time to learn instead of going in hard
[3:31:36] <%stephane3012> japan very not-progressive
[3:31:59] <Royal8383> The Wolf's jacked is pretty killer
[3:32:03] <Royal8383> jacket
[3:32:09] <GreyFoxHoundDD> Japanese essentially tell the handicapped to get fucked in their own legislation. I don't think game devs would think of that.
[3:32:23] <%RioGascar> @woolieversus i would think it would have a lot of accessibility options since its being published by activision and they are known for making a game as available as possible
[3:32:35] <+roxikat> Cockality

[3:33:20] <+Zeemod155> hehhhhhh?

[3:33:52] <%CEGold> @gustavozxd Google tells me Game Republic were the developers
[3:33:54] <gigacanuck> man it blows me away that "I see" is "naruhodo", but I'll always associate "naruhodo" with the hentai artist of the same name
[3:33:57] <zepelinnn> "THAT NIGHT"
[3:34:00] <Videogamer4> LUL
[3:34:04] <%stephane3012> is the game only voiced in japanese?

[3:34:31] <%smoe79> Is there any penalty to dying it this game?
[3:34:39] <heckingjen> i wonder if this convo is completely different if you beat that estate area already
[3:34:40] <%juxtest> Say, youre not a Cleric are you
[3:34:43] <+LastHazzerd> main menu settings
[3:34:57] <HeavyC4> it a penalty worse than dark souls @smoe79 that all i'm going to say
[3:34:57] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[3:35:12] <GreyFoxHoundDD> @CEGold Maybe not like a remake, but PS2 games get HD remasters all the time. If Ty the Tasmanian Tiger can get remastered, Ganji can
[3:35:16] <GreyFoxHoundDD> *genji
[3:35:17] <%smoe79> @HeavyC4 fair enough! Thanks!
[3:35:21] <+Dogbert24> is his skin horrible messed up?

[3:36:01] <Royal8383> give the mooney
[3:36:04] <rasamune> @LastHazzerd yes but also a yen used to be worth a hell of a lot more
[3:36:07] <Rawpost> @smoe79 you lose half your exp and gold, and a disease halts npc quest over time
[3:36:16] <+LastHazzerd> ah good point
[3:36:18] <gigacanuck> so uh, do you ever sheath your blade in this game?
[3:36:29] <Videogamer4> in the hub @gigacanuck

[4:05:03] <+Dogbert24> disrupt the timeline
[4:05:04] <%lewdskeletor13> @barkon345 No but this game very obviously includes Souls elements, even if they combat and mobility are different.
[4:05:07] <Mocohuasca> And being dishonest about that is kind of annoying
[4:05:11] <twitchyal> Oh my god it is so rare for me to catch these.
[4:05:11] <$cureneckbeard> How can you tell anyone's alignment when they don't chuckle
[4:05:24] <twitchyal> Woolie the impact you had on my life is more than you can fathom!
[4:05:34] <%Klefth> Yeah, that seems very Tenchu-y
[4:05:38] <+Konquerer> none of them are jumping on roofs
[4:05:41] <Dragon_Batman> @PlatinumWyvern he met him here first actually that's when the Patches thing was happeing.
[4:05:41] <brunoberserk> woolie already killed the oni ?
[4:05:45] <Mocohuasca> Atlus only makes Persona and From only makes Souls

[4:07:16] <+MrMcCrabby> did woolie miss the ax?
[4:07:17] <$cureneckbeard> Pat's changing to English dub becuase he's a baka

[4:07:26] <LVDoomien> there was an item to the right from where that ally guy was
[4:07:30] <%RioGascar> Does that count as a death if you dont die again
[4:07:31] <%CEGold> Sekiro must be a gamer Kappa he has multiple lives Kappa Kappa
[4:07:36] <Frostilk> shouldn't honor him like that LUL

[4:08:06] <xshrike> @cascadepersona true but, do you remember how the fans freaked out over them talking about making an easy mode?
[4:08:07] <Hydrapissed> uh oh boss guy
[4:08:10] <kiraellion> whats the kanji for teabag
[4:08:11] <+cascadepersona> I can't wait to play this when I have more time. Probably for my birthday in 2 months.
[4:08:17] <jorgeniev> oh look a boss
[4:08:25] <%lewdskeletor13> Birthday games are good games
[4:08:34] <%dukenux> Run awaaaaaaaaay

[4:08:58] <jorgeniev> yes cowardice wins again!
[4:08:59] <Cymen90> WHY ARE YOU RUNNING
[4:09:11] <+MrMcCrabby> running is the best strategy
[4:09:20] <xshrike> Wait. Is their blood actually silver color?
[4:09:21] <arfsm95> @WoolieVersus if you dash foward against those atacks, you activate mikiri, don't forget that

[4:09:34] <%RioGascar> What kind of Shinobi hunter doesnt track down a Shinobi
[4:09:36] <SsHomes> @xshrike that's oil
[4:09:36] <Shishi1205> You should find a budha
[4:09:40] <%DrPoxx> I knew this was woolies Vagabond RP game
[4:09:40] <%RioGascar> ONE JUST ATTACKED
[4:09:42] <+hax_metatron> Did Woolie get the axe?!
[4:09:44] <%dukenux> Where did Wolf learn Joestar Secret Technique? woolieVERGIN
[4:09:47] <+MisterTylerrr> heely to escape your feelies
[4:09:48] <%RioGascar> and then ran away
[4:09:49] <Cymen90> CHAT did Woolie make anybody sick yet?
[4:09:55] <Shishi1205> Nop
[4:09:57] <%lewdskeletor13> No
[4:09:59] <%CEGold> @RioGascar One who's 2 days away from retirement Kappa
[4:10:03] <Senselessvirus> @WoolieVersus I just switched from Pat's stream and it's clear Woolie understands the "ninja" part of the game way better than Pat.
[4:10:04] <Dragon_Batman> So far Woolie doesn't have a sick person
[4:10:05] <%lewdskeletor13> Woolie is too good at the game
[4:10:05] <Cymen90> Wait, not even the Carver?
[4:10:06] <haitakaa> budha budha budha budha rockin everywhere
[4:10:12] <+jean_kirschtein_neigh> Enter the ninja
[4:10:12] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:10:27] <jorgeniev> watch out!
[4:10:28] <GoldeNOVA> Acquire skills! you have two points!
[4:10:35] <Dragon_Batman> Not even the carver
[4:10:40] <%lewdskeletor13> This combat seems satisfying
[4:10:43] <+thunderhog> yeah Minh, sitting down at a bonfire/warp point respawns the whole world minus bosses
[4:10:47] <jorgeniev> parry
[4:10:53] <+hax_metatron> PARRY THE ARROWS
[4:10:54] <AlasterAngelo> Woolie the coward
[4:10:59] <Frostilk> round 2!
[4:11:01] <jorgeniev> you can do it woolie
[4:11:01] <+SolverCODO> Both Woolie and Pat like to turn their backs on and look away from archers firing at them
[4:11:01] <+hax_metatron> ROYAL GUARD THE ARROWS
[4:11:07] <arfsm95> @WoolieVersus i think you have skill points
[4:11:08] <+cascadepersona> Does this play more similar to Nioh or Bloodborne?
[4:11:13] <%lewdskeletor13> Minh is right LUL
[4:11:15] <Combatrobot423> T H E B A C K D O W N
[4:11:19] <+maxamillion629> Stealth? Shinobi right?
[4:11:28] <f4ntom98> LUL
[4:11:33] <%CEGold> We back down bois PogChamp
[4:11:34] <Sakhasa> @cascadepersona You know what? That's a tough question
[4:11:35] <@Menitta> Do shadows make a difference in stealth or nah
[4:11:37] <GreyFoxHoundDD> @cascadepersona I think it plays more like a slightly faster Bloodborne
[4:11:38] <@Menitta> Doesnt look like it
[4:11:39] <thetruthofyourbeing> Coward shinobi
[4:11:43] <%lewdskeletor13> Cowards Die Twice
[4:11:46] <vicviper_t301> It's not that there's no saving, it's ALWAYS saving. You waste all your items? They're gone
[4:11:49] <%barkon345> @cascadepersona More Nioh but Honestly Neither of them
[4:11:51] <+SilverDevilfish> Ninja Lifesaver
[4:11:53] <haitakaa> cowards never die
[4:11:54] <+Konquerer> i immediately regretted not getting this once i saw that it's royal guard the game
[4:12:07] <+jean_kirschtein_neigh> I'm still waiting for Ghost of Tsushima
[4:12:12] <+cascadepersona> Interesting. This makes my anticipation even greater.
[4:12:15] <Combatrobot423> I'm curious, does the parry in this game have a more forgiving timing than other titles?
[4:12:20] <%lewdskeletor13> I wish Wolf would snap his fingers and shout “ROYAL GUARD”
[4:12:23] <xshrike> @Konquerer do you mean pre-order?
[4:12:32] <GreyFoxHoundDD> @cascadepersona It plays like Tenchu
[4:12:32] <jorgeniev> holy shit i forgot about ghosts of tsushima
[4:12:45] <%lewdskeletor13> Ghosts looks pretty cool
[4:12:47] <+jean_kirschtein_neigh> @jorgeniev It looks GORGE
[4:12:48] <@Menitta> I saw that game again, that game is really pretty
[4:12:48] <+Konquerer> yeah now it's gonna be a while before i can get it
[4:12:50] <haitakaa> the Ghost of Sushi-hime
[4:12:54] <%barkon345> Tenchu with much better combat
[4:13:01] <AlasterAngelo> BUSHIDO DIGNIFIED
[4:13:02] <Cymen90> @WoolieVersus Did you do the tutorials?
[4:13:04] <%CEGold> For a shinobi he sure can't kill people silently cmonBruh
[4:13:07] <AlasterAngelo> IT'S THE LAST STAND OF THE SAMURAI
[4:13:10] <reiju_22> ghosts will probably play like shit
[4:13:37] <%lewdskeletor13> I’m glad you can see the future
[4:13:39] <@Menitta> Sort of like a Tom Cruise's The Last Samurai meets Takehiko Inoue's Vagabond
[4:13:40] <Dragon_Batman> Their Poise is really doing you in
[4:13:40] <+cascadepersona> Hopefully Ghosts has a more involved combat system.
[4:13:43] <+maxamillion629> Shadows can’t block apparently
[4:13:45] <+jean_kirschtein_neigh> @reiju_22 But it looks so PRETTY
[4:13:57] <haitakaa> Japan has a national holiday called Tom Cruise Day

[4:14:07] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 14 minutes

[4:14:34] <+hax_metatron> The real Sekiro starts here
[4:14:39] <+jean_kirschtein_neigh> @haitakaa Even tho the movie Last Samurai sucks
[4:14:45] <gigacanuck> K so what's with that purple shrinking bar on the screen
[4:14:51] <AlasterAngelo> last samurai was okay
[4:14:57] <haitakaa> the real Sekiro was the friends we made along the way
[4:15:13] <$dredgenwulf> So how many Vergil quotes has Woolie made so far?
[4:15:14] <%lewdskeletor13> Sekiro was in our hearts all along
[4:15:20] <+Voidwyvern> can you enemy step the shield guys?
[4:15:30] <Shishi1205> "I need more power!"
[4:15:30] <xshrike> @gigacanuck do you mean yellow?
[4:15:35] <+MrMcCrabby> you can ax the shield guys
[4:15:38] <jorgeniev> does wolf have a devil trigger?
[4:15:42] <%DrPoxx> The Sekiro was the friends you made along the way
[4:15:47] <Cymen90> No axe yet?
[4:15:50] <SPidERMan8576> Shield hero
[4:15:51] <haitakaa> so are monsters just normal things in this universe?
[4:15:51] <gigacanuck> no, the one that was purple
[4:15:56] <gigacanuck> it's not on there now
[4:16:00] <+shiokenstar> there's no kick or anything to break shields?
[4:16:02] <+George_W_Kushhhhh> He missed the axe iI beli
[4:16:04] <Akett> The purple one is fire.
[4:16:14] <Combatrobot423> How are you meant to handle shielded enemies before you get the axe?
[4:16:18] <%RioGascar> Woolie you’re straight up not gonna get this guys by just parrying, you’ll probably need to move around and use their slow speed to your advantage
[4:16:20] <Combatrobot423> Or is the axe the only way?
[4:16:20] <ScudmanSentinel> Probably a better idea to disengage
[4:16:20] <%viewingshades> gotta find that axe
[4:16:23] <%CEGold> @shiokenstar There's a ninja tool that breaks shields
[4:16:26] <Sarumarine> Bloodborne made fun of shields. Now Sekiro is bringing them back.
[4:16:29] <gigacanuck> if only you could just set them on fire.....
[4:16:31] <%lewdskeletor13> woolieF sipsipHellmo woolieT sipsipHellmo woolieS sipsipHellmo woolieU
[4:16:31] <haitakaa> can you use the hookshot on enemies?
[4:16:38] <Dragon_Batman> You might be able to dodge em sideways
[4:16:40] <AlasterAngelo> des
[4:16:40] <%DrPoxx> 4?
[4:16:43] <black_mages_matter_> eat their ass
[4:16:53] <%viewingshades> leave!
[4:16:57] <+Ilpala271> YOU DIDN'T WIN! YOU DIDN'T WIN!
[4:16:57] <black_mages_matter_> eating ass is proper
[4:16:58] <AlasterAngelo> real scum tactics
[4:17:01] <LulzorGG> properly involves an axe.
[4:17:03] <black_mages_matter_> only true gentlemen eat ass
[4:17:04] <+George_W_Kushhhhh> The axe is by far the best way, I believe he just missed it however
[4:17:05] <jorgeniev> oh shit he basically lost already
[4:17:09] <Shishi1205> flank them maybe? @WoolieVersus
[4:17:16] <$dredgenwulf> Hand forged katana, passed down throughout the ages. Can't cut through a wooden shield. Seems legit.
[4:17:16] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[4:17:22] <+MrMcCrabby> he almost broke their posture by parrying the multi hit so you can get good
[4:17:26] <+secretspud> If only he had some sort of weapon designed to cut wood or something
[4:17:28] <jorgeniev> that shield is invincible how can it be!
[4:17:29] <%CEGold> He put his back against the wall. the AI is learning LUL
[4:17:32] <+MrMcCrabby> just doesnt seem worht fighting these guys without the ax
[4:17:35] <CrackerJack450> @woolieversus I think you missed something by headband shop guy
[4:17:40] <BaronVonWidget> wait, when was the ax?
[4:17:41] <jorgeniev> RUN
[4:17:41] <Cymen90> *walk around, then walks back in front of the shield'
[4:17:42] <%lewdskeletor13> It’s really tough wood guys woolieMIRIN
[4:17:43] <LegendaryDorkKnight> !AXE!
[4:17:45] <+MisterTylerrr> Woolie, remember PLague's Dark Souls 2 advice.
[4:17:51] <+MisterTylerrr> Stop trying to face fuck them
[4:17:52] <Shishi1205> Dodge cut too maybe
[4:17:55] <%Ninestempest> i mean, a katana would probably break against solid wood
[4:17:57] <+DeadpanSoupcan> slot in the flame barrel at least

[4:22:53] <gustavozxd> nioh gives you titles for beating bosses and it gets awkward sometimes
[4:22:56] <%lewdskeletor13> Why is Woolie prejudiced against burds
[4:22:57] <+cascadepersona> Watch there be a twist whre its like "Oh yeah, people are getting Chicken Pox that TURNS people into chickens."

[4:25:10] <%Ninestempest> he probably doesn't know about the axe lol
[4:25:20] <%RioGascar> Can you use the grapple in battle against enemies @woolieversus
[4:25:26] <beautyfulman> Except an NPC said an axe was in the area

[4:25:39] <%Ninestempest> he probably doesn't remember about the axe <_<
[4:25:42] <black_mages_matter_> can you use that gunpowder to make bombs? i think that was suggesting it
[4:26:08] <Thalchampz> can't you go back to make the fire shit so you can burn their shields?
[4:26:14] <black_mages_matter_> bombs could stun him long enough to deal with him
[4:26:16] <haitakaa> use your Tekkens skills to sidestep around the tracking
[4:26:18] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Yomi is the kick
[4:26:18] <$dredgenwulf> Also this Witcher ass music is dope.
[4:26:25] <%Sxy_T_Rex> Axe beats shield
[4:26:27] <%pearockb> @riogascar Battle grapple is a skill you learn later
[4:26:35] <BaronVonWidget> the axe is the kick
[4:26:42] <%lewdskeletor13> Kicks might be an unlockable skill?
[4:26:44] <mike_hawch> can you use your grappling hook on enemies?
[4:26:45] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Yomi is the art of reading the mind of the opponent
[4:26:51] <beautyfulman> @WoolieVersus That axe is the kick, its just in the one area you haven't looked
[4:26:54] <+MrMcCrabby> that works too
[4:26:58] <gigacanuck> woolie listen, somewhere around here there is an ax

[4:28:14] <%lewdskeletor13> Woolie lemme AXE you a question
[4:28:29] <haitakaa> Woolie is too polite to eavesdrop
[4:28:30] <black_mages_matter_> @lewdskeletor13 cmonBruh
[4:28:34] <@Moobot> Please don't fill up the entire chat, @Shishi1205
[4:28:40] <beautyfulman> @WoolieVersus wasn't there a bamboo path near the merchant guy from the future, or was that a dead end?
[4:28:41] <%lewdskeletor13> LUL
[4:28:46] <%DrPoxx> Oh those shield huys are just Axing for it now
[4:28:53] <$dredgenwulf> I might be wrong here but I'm pretty sure the only thing Woolie reads on his Twitch are his subs.
[4:29:00] <%lewdskeletor13> Someone tried to write a novel in chat LUL
[4:29:15] <Shishi1205> I copy pasted from a guide
[4:29:17] <+MrMcCrabby> you didn't check all the side areas
[4:29:25] <+jean_kirschtein_neigh> Sayonara y'all
[4:29:32] <+DeadpanSoupcan> its a temple
[4:29:35] <haitakaa> maybe whisper him
[4:29:35] <%TheGamerMaldito> TheGamerBendito subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[4:29:37] <%lewdskeletor13> @dredgenwulf you are wrong, He reads chat
[4:29:45] <haitakaa> there was a second eavesdrop wasn't there?
[4:29:48] <%CEGold> An ingame map would probably help cmonBruh @FromSoft
[4:29:55] <Dragon_Batman> He reads the chat
[4:30:01] <+LastHazzerd> the housing unit opposite of the place with the 4 roosters
[4:30:05] <Shishi1205> Going deep towards that door theyre banging
[4:30:11] <vVAstrAVv> how does his brain do it
[4:30:11] <$dredgenwulf> @lewdskeletor13 BUT HE NEVER READS MY MESSAGES. Nah just messing, I've never caught him reading chat while I'm around, my bad.
[4:30:13] <Khorneflakes_> Try near the shortcut/gate
[4:30:16] <+LastHazzerd> there are two guards outside of a small buddah temple with an eaves drop prompt

[4:30:20] <MultipleJiggs> Pat's pooping so now I'm here.
[4:30:20] <KitsuneManami> HOw is everyone playing this early?
[4:30:21] <%lewdskeletor13> Ingame maps are for cowards
[4:30:28] <beautyfulman> @WoolieVersus there was a walled off area across from the rooster area that you didn't check
[4:30:28] <+LastHazzerd> back by the door you opened for the shortcut
[4:30:29] <Shishi1205> Grapple up past the door they were trying to get into, and you’ll find a relatively safe area. Keep going the opposite direction of the door, and there will be another walled in space you can cross into. that text is b4 the other one

[4:39:31] <+shiokenstar> blue = passive maybe?
[4:39:31] <gigacanuck> pretty nice personality tool
[4:39:33] <LegendaryDorkKnight> I liked black chick with purple hair
[4:39:35] <AllenDeadman> shinobi skills remain
[4:39:38] <%PeoplesChimp> you have 2 more
[4:39:43] <haitakaa> yoruichi is a good choice
[4:39:46] <%PeoplesChimp> to spend
[4:40:00] <LegendaryDorkKnight> @haitakaa ma man
[4:40:08] <justafoxhere> Who's been keeping track of resurrections
[4:40:17] <%Sxy_T_Rex> @WoolieVersus only red need to be equipped
[4:40:18] <+MrMcCrabby> get that air guard
[4:40:21] <gigacanuck> ah, latent skill sounds like you don't ahve to equip
[4:40:34] <Shishi1205> He should be near 10
[4:40:38] <beautyfulman> @WoolieVersus Go equip the axe
[4:40:40] <+maxamillion629> Countering is better than blocking in this game apparently
[4:40:44] <%PeoplesChimp> orange is latent buff, blue is movement, red is combat art
[4:40:48] <Akett> Shouldn't you go install the axe?
[4:40:49] <haitakaa> get that ass Woolie
[4:40:54] <%sirisvirus> Did he miss the flame ability?
[4:41:00] <Hydrapissed> has it
[4:41:02] <+MrMcCrabby> he got the flame tool
[4:41:03] <+shiokenstar> he got the flame stuff
[4:41:05] <LegendaryDorkKnight> read chat and you'll find out?
[4:41:11] <reiju_22> Boss Kappa
[4:41:12] <%CEGold> @sirisvirus He got it
[4:41:20] <%sirisvirus> cool thanks
[4:41:22] <justafoxhere> Should probably practice that counter at the guy back at the temple
[4:41:22] <+mcjimbo12> so it's megaman
[4:41:32] <haitakaa> MIKIRI COUNTAAAA
[4:41:34] <JeoDood> megaman
[4:41:37] <%Sxy_T_Rex> yeah woolie thats a boss, they dont get much bigger than that :P
[4:41:49] <tag545> huge
[4:41:57] <+MrMcCrabby> yeyeyeye
[4:42:16] <%lewdskeletor13> Wow that’s rad as hell
[4:42:20] <Shishi1205> If that works against the hunter dude he's done
[4:42:26] <%CEGold> That's a power move if I ever seen one
[4:42:28] <%Sxy_T_Rex> it does
[4:42:29] <Dehlome> deathblow counter is real good
[4:42:38] <haitakaa> this kinda reminds me of the Wolf Stones in Twilight Princess where the guy taught you new moves
[4:42:42] <+MrMcCrabby> even the dude you beat up thought it was satisfying
[4:42:43] <AlasterAngelo> that guy could not give less of a fuck you're stabbing his head
[4:42:49] <+LastHazzerd> crouch
[4:42:50] <alexandrecau> can he show you how to use the axe?
[4:42:53] <%lewdskeletor13> He’s immortal
[4:43:06] <%lewdskeletor13> He lets you use him as a training dummy
[4:43:11] <gigacanuck> @haitakaa ah yes, hallucinating the ghost of your past self so he can teach you sick sword moves
[4:43:13] <Rawpost> a slarry

[4:43:31] <Hydrapissed> baseball slide them

[4:44:30] <leviathan666303> fire is for that big monster
[4:44:31] <%lewdskeletor13> It’s so weird to me that this game has a Devil Breaker mechanic
[4:44:45] <%CEGold> This arm of mine burns with an awesome power!

[4:50:06] <kiraellion> your poise bar is your stamina
[4:50:12] <Raldavar> Woolie's true stand is "The Back down" with the invincible controlling fate. You can't lose a fight because it never happens
[4:50:49] <Faralai> Game gets so brutal later on in the game.

[4:53:58] <%CEGold> @novusboi That's cringy enough to be on one of these shirts. Well done LUL
[4:54:09] <kiraellion> as he ignores both his flame cannon and shuriken launcher

[4:55:09] <novusboi> @cegold I wish I could come up with that level of genius. It’s from a Naruto shirt.
[4:55:18] <kiraellion> oh and he unlocked the skill treefor his prosthetics but probally wont realise that for another 10 hours :P
[4:55:31] <%CEGold> @novusboi Of course it's from a Naruto shirt LUL LUL LUL
[4:55:58] <+Some_guy92> That shirt NotLikeThis
[4:56:07] <+MisterTylerrr> Which one lol
[4:56:31] <mayorrev> heh nothing personal kiddo
[4:56:44] <%CEGold> I love how the Fairy Tail one is practically unreadable LUL
[4:56:46] <sappinmahbinyot> First time tuning into a woolie stream. Hey guys!
[4:56:52] <novusboi> hi
[4:57:02] <novusboi> me momo novus
[4:57:07] <mayorrev> I'm close to leveling
[4:57:16] <mayorrev> and you look like just enough XP
[4:57:22] <%CEGold> Recardless woolieGASM woolieGASM
[4:57:23] <GUNxSPECTRE> Are those shirts actually real?
[4:57:42] <+MisterTylerrr> If they made one of these with vergil on it, you know Woolie would have one
[4:57:43] <%CEGold> @GUNxSPECTRE He had to get them from somewhere Kappa
[4:57:58] <+Some_guy92> I think the way to make the shorts more rediculous would be to pick more obscure animes.
[4:58:17] <+Some_guy92> *shirts
[4:58:18] <captainthunderwolf> AH THE IDAHO SHIRT
[4:58:25] <GUNxSPECTRE> I don't condone or enjoy violence, but if I saw those shirts in the wild
[4:58:27] <%CEGold> I want a Golden Boy shirt with "How do you like my swimming?" face on it Kreygasm
[4:58:28] <Cymen90> OMFG these shirts...
[4:58:45] <captainthunderwolf> OH THIS ONE'S GREAT
[4:59:07] <gigacanuck> euuuuugh
[4:59:09] <GUNxSPECTRE> The Kirito one deserves gasoline and a lit match
[4:59:10] <DerpioParty> Woolie knows to endorse the REAL Black Swordsman after all
[4:59:10] <gigacanuck> these shirts man
[4:59:16] <%CEGold> If I saw someone wearing one of these in public, I don't think I'd be able to keep myself from not laughing LUL
[4:59:19] <+MisterTylerrr> I'm getting some pain from these pizza rolls.
[4:59:28] <captainthunderwolf> The Fairy Tail one looks way too much like something I'd actually see someone wearing.
[4:59:42] <novusboi> Woolie your dump is killing your viewcount squeeze that mfer out
[4:59:45] <%CEGold> @GUNxSPECTRE Which one? because the one that says "Recardless" Is A+ BlessRNG
[4:59:52] <captainthunderwolf> The Majin Vegeta one might actually be the least painful.
[4:59:52] <GUNxSPECTRE> Even anime con-staff would escort you out
[4:59:52] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 5 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 20oz (600mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[4:59:55] <novusboi> *also a good T-shirt idea
[5:00:22] <GUNxSPECTRE> No Ragrets
[5:00:22] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[5:00:23] <%CEGold> woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM
[5:00:26] <captainthunderwolf> Okay, that Kirito shirt is the BEST out of all of these.
[5:00:34] <captainthunderwolf> Oh man.
[5:00:34] <gigacanuck> cursed shirts
[5:00:43] <Dragon_Batman> Man these shirts give a special kind of hurt
[5:00:54] <%Methados> Admit it. Anyone here ever own a shirt like these?
[5:01:05] <captainthunderwolf> No, but I've seen a lot of them.
[5:01:07] <sappinmahbinyot> Holy shit that kirito shirt
[5:01:13] <kiraellion> i mean besides you? i dont think so :P
[5:01:14] <GUNxSPECTRE> Those DoucheBag Shirts with the swirly vine designs are less painful
[5:01:15] <+goose_attack_almanac> recardless of what you say
[5:01:17] <+MisterTylerrr> I've seen some young Marines wear them
[5:01:24] <gigacanuck> nothing ever on this level
[5:01:35] <captainthunderwolf> THAT ONE TOO
[5:01:35] <GUNxSPECTRE> Marines eat Crayons, so it makes sense
[5:01:37] <%Methados> Place I see DBZ shirts A LOT is at the Gym
[5:01:45] <captainthunderwolf> I actually saw at least one of these.
[5:02:03] <simpleplayer91> i cant seem to find the song
[5:02:05] <simpleplayer91> any help?
[5:02:09] <Shishi1205> the vegeta one is the most famous
[5:02:11] <captainthunderwolf> Bottom right.
[5:02:13] <novusboi> One time my mom got me a shirt that day redheads make up less than two percent of the population so basically I’m a majestic unicorn
[5:02:18] <sappinmahbinyot> I don't know which one is better
[5:02:21] <simpleplayer91> weird, didnt find it on yt, gonna try again
[5:02:24] <gigacanuck> oh god that Sasuke one
[5:02:28] <GUNxSPECTRE> I mean, at this point, a Dragonball shirt is like seeing a Mickey Mouse shirt for me
[5:02:31] <Shishi1205> I'm pretty sure the song is unreleased
[5:02:34] <captainthunderwolf> It's a song Little V wrote for Woolie's channel, so maybe it's on Little V's page?
[5:02:35] <%Sxy_T_Rex> oooooo only 2 more hours until Sekiro unlocks
[5:02:49] <sappinmahbinyot> the kirito one or the sasuke one. They're both so equally painful.
[5:02:54] <simpleplayer91> ah, alright thanks for answers
[5:03:03] <%CEGold> But they hurt so good woolieGASM
[5:03:12] <GUNxSPECTRE> Sasuke is way better than Kirito

[5:10:50] <Nameless0100> monkaS
[5:10:54] <dan_g_v> awesome, I hope he had enough titanite to upgrade his bionic arm
[5:11:21] <LulzorGG> there's a ladder tho
[5:11:27] <Finakala> It's that one ladder nobody ever sees
[5:11:28] <worldbrand> well i must say you are an odd fellow
[5:11:30] <dan_g_v> ladders are for samurais
[5:11:32] <kiraellion> Bimmy: after you beat the wolf. OF COURSE HE BEAT THE WWOLF
[5:11:35] <+MrMcCrabby> this is a surprise
[5:11:40] <dan_g_v> and they are not ninja, so they are losers
[5:11:42] <Dragon_Batman> You didn't find the ladder than
[5:11:50] <T_sarr> hey guys is woolie enjoying the game so far?
[5:11:56] <LulzorGG> seems it yeah
[5:11:59] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> atpRtsd

[5:12:11] <gustavozxd> wow
[5:12:12] <$Tarcanist_> did you play the old Tenchu games by k2 and aqcuire? @woolieversus
[5:12:13] <saturnianocean> And I thought Woolie was blind
[5:12:14] <Dragon_Batman> I think it's a lever you gotta pull
[5:12:15] <+maxamillion629> Did you try trying?
[5:12:17] <+EySoyCoco> that is some spiderman bs
[5:12:19] <numberj420> lmao...
[5:12:21] <+Chimeraelite> That's a bit extreme
[5:12:25] <%Sxy_T_Rex> thats not even trying
[5:12:28] <dan_g_v> never give up giving up trying
[5:12:30] <LulzorGG> lmao
[5:12:38] <numberj420> couldn
[5:12:42] <gustavozxd> that's not trying
[5:12:43] <DartonLance> all i can think is "hey why dont you play fortnite"
[5:12:51] <dan_g_v> Pickle Pee? Pump a Rump?
[5:12:57] <a_mad_dragon> woolie preparing to bleach that side of the couch Kappa
[5:12:59] <LulzorGG> you, yes you
[5:13:00] <+Chimeraelite> LUL
[5:13:02] <numberj420> thats just sad lmao
[5:13:04] <kiraellion> no one else focusing on how minh said he beat the wolf?
[5:13:09] <Dragon_Batman> I didn't realize that could happen
[5:13:12] <worldbrand> I wanna be like hey man people like what they like but this is driving me wild
[5:13:19] <kiraellion> just me ok.
[5:13:24] <+Chimeraelite> well the wolf is beatable, it's just a slog
[5:13:41] <gustavozxd> of all the reasons, that is the reason
[5:13:49] <Finakala> Yeah the wolf is easy, but takes forever
[5:13:51] <reiju_22> LUL
[5:13:51] <gustavozxd> I don't even like bloodborne and I'm NotLikeThis
[5:14:01] <Dragon_Batman> So he just needs a partner that spots stuff I guess
[5:14:11] <+MrMcCrabby> is this the start of lp funsies
[5:14:11] <+maxamillion629> You obviously don’t like ladders
[5:14:21] <dan_g_v> fireball into psycho crusher, Woolie
[5:14:34] <gustavozxd> his arm looks like sweet surrender right now
[5:14:34] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:14:35] <%Sxy_T_Rex> thats some heavy hipster stuff
[5:14:49] <numberj420> yeah fortnite is pretty niche
[5:14:51] <reiju_22> that guy helped woolie LUL
[5:14:57] <T_Sasquatch> so i just destroyed the final boss on dmcv LUL Buster arm is fucking op
[5:15:15] <gustavozxd> actually the final boss has low ass heatlh
[5:15:24] <masterfire23> naruto to boruto shinobi strikers DansGame
[5:15:42] <dan_g_v> so, how is the ranking in Sekiro? Bonzai, Amaterasu, Sake?
[5:15:45] <gustavozxd> oh no I forgot about the boruto game
[5:15:50] <numberj420> so what games does this dude play
[5:15:52] <+chronopaladin> it's okay to not like things
[5:16:05] <dan_g_v> the best ones, Numberj
[5:16:08] <@Menitta> I'm still missing out on Nier Automata
[5:16:27] <leviathan666303> if anything he can look at the cool shit on youtube
[5:16:28] <numberj420> like what super panty quest 69?
[5:16:33] <saturnianocean> Automata is so good
[5:16:37] <+MisterTylerrr> I'm not MISSING OUT on Nier...I just have yet to finish it
[5:16:39] <gustavozxd> I was gonna buy nier but then dmc5 and even then the new version of nier is coming out so I'm waiting for that
[5:16:45] <worldbrand> everyone knows super panty quest 67 isd the best one
[5:16:55] <Dragon_Batman> Giving it a try is really the least anyone can do, also Fuck yes Nier Automata is so good.
[5:17:10] <+megamanx74> dark souls was a trend
[5:17:12] <dan_g_v> we still a Dark Royale
[5:17:17] <Finakala> NieR and NieR:Automata were both great
[5:17:17] <+EySoyCoco> nioh 2 still to come, the first one was more than legit
[5:17:17] <@Menitta> Tetris 99 will save and kill the Battle Royale Trend
[5:17:18] <dan_g_v> still need, even
[5:17:20] <%badmr7> Trend feels like the wrong word
[5:17:22] <+maxamillion629> Dark souls is a company
[5:17:31] <+Chimeraelite> giutrar hero is a niche far smaller than BRs
[5:17:44] <dan_g_v> right now, it seems like we are approaching the Samurai era. Tsukima incoming, right?
[5:17:45] <+PenmanLupine> Guitar Heroes and Rock Band were just mainstream versions of the Rhythm Genre. The plastic instruments gimmick was a trend, rhythm games are a genre
[5:17:49] <%Rawpost> Souls-like is literally a tag on steam
[5:17:52] <gustavozxd> this game is not like the game I never played at all says Billy
[5:17:54] <+PrinnyNorth> Dark souls is a goddamn institution
[5:17:58] <%badmr7> I feel like maybe fad or exposure period would be better, cause I get what Minh is going for.
[5:18:03] <zakti_prime> fromsoft making souls-like games? impossible
[5:18:05] <@Menitta> Nioh gets compared to Ninja Gaiden Black a lot too. I dont see that but I guess.
[5:18:07] <TheGreatBamBe> casual filter
[5:18:09] <kiraellion> @WoolieVersus your shinobi tools are your devil breakers except replenish faster.
[5:18:16] <kiraellion> use em
[5:18:16] <Finakala> NioH was fun
[5:18:17] <+PenmanLupine> Souls like games and Battle Royale are a genre. They won't go away. They'll get less popular when different things come out, but they won't go away
[5:18:20] <%Sxy_T_Rex> macho man in the house
[5:18:22] <+damnitmcgarnicle> u cant tell if its a trend till it goes away. like candle light.
[5:18:27] <Finakala> Although fuck those flamewheel assholes
[5:18:28] <JeoDood> alex
[5:18:33] <kiraellion> gonna make me link prozd :P
[5:18:36] <dan_g_v> Nioh 2 is also a thing, no?
[5:18:38] <gustavozxd> I loved nioh so much
[5:18:39] <+chronopaladin> "fad" is probably a more accurate term here
[5:18:42] <Dragon_Batman> These are the people that made it the thing
[5:18:43] <numberj420> i only play games with underage anime girls in them
[5:18:44] <saturnianocean> Music still on point
[5:18:46] <+EySoyCoco> @dan_g_v yup
[5:18:47] <T_Sasquatch> nioh is so much better mechanically than souls but boy i cant stand the difficulty
[5:18:51] <Cymen90> @WoolieVersus Except SF5 is nothing but following trends
[5:18:52] <worldbrand> hahaha, fighting games, a trend
[5:19:01] <gigacanuck> @numberj420 why don't you take a seat
[5:19:06] <leviathan666303> nioh 2 coming out
[5:19:07] <LVDoomien> Lords of the Fallen
[5:19:16] <numberj420> im already sitting your move
[5:19:19] <Finakala> I think the main issue with NioH is that it's a bit too reliant on gear
[5:19:34] <+maxamillion629> What’s that side scrolling souls game called?
[5:19:36] <arfsm95> @WoolieVersus god of war attacks like souls
[5:19:42] <%Sxy_T_Rex> dead cells
[5:19:42] <Finakala> Like I've 100%'d it and overgearing makes things way too easy, or being undergeared makes everything spongey
[5:19:45] <worldbrand> salt & sanctuary?
[5:19:45] <dan_g_v> Salt and Sanctuary?
[5:19:52] <sileo_patronus> @maxamillion629 which one?
[5:19:52] <Dragon_Batman> Yea, as much as I liked Nioh the gear was a bit much
[5:19:56] <+EySoyCoco> souls are easily the most influential games of this decade
[5:19:57] <gustavozxd> there's a lot of games coming out lately in the souls subgenre
[5:19:59] <T_Sasquatch> @maxamillion629 i hate the purifying mechanic
[5:20:01] <numberj420> lol who the fuck is this dude?
[5:20:02] <+damnitmcgarnicle> boom
[5:20:13] <gustavozxd> he doesn't even know what he's talking about LUL
[5:20:26] <+mickers> i remember a mmo where you do lose exp when u die
[5:20:27] <+damnitmcgarnicle> @numberj420 hes slows woolie down if he progresses too fast
[5:20:32] <+maxamillion629> It’s salt and sanctuary I think
[5:20:34] <numberj420> apparently
[5:20:37] <+Carquar> I think his mom needs to come pick him up
[5:20:42] <+MisterTylerrr> @mickers FF11
[5:20:45] <+damnitmcgarnicle> LUL LUL
[5:20:46] <Finakala> Salt & Sanctuary was pretty decent to be fair
[5:20:46] <BestTeaMaker> @woolieversus ironically, hollow knight wasnt souls inspired. the devs took their inspirations from much older games like Zelda 2 and Faxanadu. It just so happens that there were soulslike elements parallel to it
[5:20:49] <numberj420> think im going back to pats stream lmao...
[5:20:53] <+George_W_Kushhhhh> Destiny, the most triple A game ever, is heavily Souls influenced from a story telling standpoint
[5:21:03] <arfsm95> @WoolieVersus god of war attacks like souls, they kinda implemented the "R1 light attack R2 heavy L1 deffend"
[5:21:13] <Dragon_Batman> I bounced of Salt and Sanctuary, it seemed pretty good though
[5:21:16] <PoisonKnuckle> Code Vein is another Souls-like that’s coming out.
[5:21:20] <numberj420> new ass creed is souls like
[5:21:23] <%Sxy_T_Rex> Doom Eternal is going to have invaders
[5:21:24] <BestTeaMaker> the devs never touched souls that in depth
[5:21:24] <kiraellion> there are mmo type games where you die lose your inventory money and exp and you have to walk to get them back most of them are MUDS and yes people can also loot your corpse to steal your lost stuff
[5:21:30] <$cureneckbeard> MMOs had corpse runs, but a particular key of Dark Souls is that you only get one try to recover it
[5:21:30] <Finakala> Hollow Knight is honestly closer to Dark Souls than Dark Souls II
[5:21:33] <BaronVonWidget> doom eternal has invaders
[5:21:45] <BraverestWarrior> Dark Souls did not invent the corpse run...
[5:21:45] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[5:21:46] <+EySoyCoco> and the invasion mechanics
[5:21:47] <numberj420> oh this guy plays cult classic niche games like nier automata makes sense now
[5:21:47] <gustavozxd> you just need to understand exactly what the "souls" subgenre means
[5:21:50] <arfsm95> @WoolieVersus god of war attacks like souls, they kinda implemented the "R1 light attack R2 heavy L1 deffend"
[5:21:55] <kiraellion> and yes some of those MUDS also had it so if you die a second time you lose your first corpse
[5:22:07] <JanusII> Saying corpse runs are from Souls is a biiig stretch.
[5:22:07] <@Menitta> Originating is one thing, popularizing is another
[5:22:09] <worldbrand> They didn't invent the corpse run, but i cant think of an earlier example of the blood puddle
[5:22:14] <$cureneckbeard> The corpse run goes back to Dungeons & Dragons
[5:22:16] <AllenDeadman> this two discussing this, and I can just imagine the oni frozen in time like "uuuh.... hello?"
[5:22:17] <BestTeaMaker> as close as hollow knight feels to a souls game, its not a direct inspiration
[5:22:22] <+maxamillion629> Praise the sun came from Souls Games
[5:22:26] <+Chimeraelite> The whole package is a bunch of small ideas all together. .You can't get rid of that and I doubt that'll gog aaway
[5:22:28] <Jeemukun> Diablo did it before i think
[5:22:28] <gigacanuck> so uh
[5:22:30] <SomersaultJustice> wow Kappa
[5:22:32] <numberj420> thought we were playing sekiro on this stream...
[5:22:34] <+EySoyCoco> CurseLit takes thursday
[5:22:35] <alexandrecau> Diablo had it
[5:22:35] <gigacanuck> we gonna see any gameplay?
[5:22:38] <kiraellion> Dablo diit yeah
[5:22:40] <+Chimeraelite> giga shush
[5:22:43] <%Rawpost> even if the mechanics existed before Soulborne games popularized them
[5:22:48] <+PenmanLupine> NO MINH. This isn't going away. Games that set their bones on difficult enemy patterns, open world exploration and death mechanics which is the 'Souls' package, is not going away
[5:22:51] <arfsm95> @WoolieVersus god of war attacks like souls, they kinda implemented the "R1 light attack R2 heavy L1 deffend"
[5:23:04] <gustavozxd> do it like Pat anytime someone asks for gameplay you stop for 20 more minutes
[5:23:07] <numberj420> sad that everyone says dark souls and forget demons souls exists
[5:23:08] <kiraellion> id argue diablo did but no one remembers the multiplayer
[5:23:16] <Dragon_Batman> The one coming that is the "clone" is Code Vein I think
[5:23:24] <+George_W_Kushhhhh> Dark souls is probably the most influential game of the past decade
[5:23:27] <ChineseNininga> 死

[5:34:11] <puffinup> It's not a fucking souls game, you're a ninja, CHEAT
[5:34:15] <+maxamillion629> Running is exactly what this game is about
[5:34:17] <+MegaMillenniumX> Oh Boy he res-ed himself again, and died anyway.
[5:34:18] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Atomic_Blowfish
[5:34:19] <JanusII> Oh Max was stuck here for a while.
[5:34:20] <worldbrand> woolie vs sekiro ft. minh, as in, minh is on sekiro's team
[5:34:29] <pwnhills> But this isn't a Souls game @WoolieVersus
[5:34:31] <Rexwarrior1> Minh is too powerful
[5:34:34] <numberj420> this dude has no idea about souls games
[5:34:41] <%lewdskeletor13> Minh is too right
[5:34:55] <+MrMcCrabby> it might be worth a try to try to brek aggro next time
[5:34:56] <+maxamillion629> Yeah but this game has a jump mechanic, stealth mechanic, and grappling hook
[5:34:59] <gigacanuck> can you stealth the boss?
[5:35:00] <T_Sasquatch> minh is right woolie LUL
[5:35:00] <%Sxy_T_Rex> sekiro is all about disengaging
[5:35:01] <StrangeCoincidence> Gibbe dis game
[5:35:04] <+maxamillion629> Running is intended
[5:35:12] <puffinup> god woolie
[5:35:15] <nerdblase> So what keeps you from pulling a Tarkus and knocking that boss off the cliff at the side of the stairs?
[5:35:18] <+maxamillion629> Not a normal souls game
[5:35:20] <+WorldsBestPanda> Poor Woolie. Lol.
[5:35:23] <BestTeaMaker> ninja coward is how you play
[5:35:25] <rsg220> how on earth were these two roommates?
[5:35:28] <numberj420> cant run from souls bosses....
[5:35:33] <T_Sasquatch> Minh is literally correct
[5:35:35] <dan_g_v> can he summon help already? Did Japanese Solaire already give him the White Soapstone?
[5:35:35] <kiraellion> @nerdblase you not being tarkus
[5:35:45] <AllenDeadman> boss? what boss?
[5:35:59] <+Das_Prints> @nerdblase it looks like you can’t knock boss enemies off cliffs. Also if you aren’t careful he’ll just chuck you over the cliff instead with one of his grabs.
[5:35:59] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:36:06] <dan_g_v> big wrestle fan up there, @AllenDeadman
[5:36:17] <AllenDeadman> oh that ain't a boss
[5:36:18] <worldbrand> is he a boss or a miniboss?
[5:36:27] <reiju_22> mini
[5:36:33] <dan_g_v> oh, he is totally a boss. Already killed Woolie like 25 times, gotta be a boss
[5:36:36] <AllenDeadman> a miniboss I would say
[5:36:46] <gigacanuck> the oil man
[5:36:52] <%lewdskeletor13> Woolie Will Figure It Out
[5:36:54] <rsg220> is there any risk to just spamming the regular dudes?
[5:37:00] <dan_g_v> doesn't look very mini. He looks like a big boi
[5:37:02] <worldbrand> look at that palisade go

[5:40:34] <+Papafleish> oh my god you're so much further than pat
[5:40:40] <dan_g_v> you guys are thirsty, wanting to oil and massage the oni

[5:40:58] <zakti_prime> no points for stylishness here, scummy moves are valid

[5:41:07] <dan_g_v> true, true
[5:41:13] <AllenDeadman> you can grapple the oni's woodplank when he misses
[5:41:16] <%Rawpost> @dman1500 oh I thought only the red symbol attacks were unparriable
[5:41:17] <%DashXero> That guy is probably already triggered.
[5:41:19] <gustavozxd> massage? well, his arm DOES look a little bit like the sweet surrender

[5:41:37] <gustavozxd> like seriously the basic starter arm looks like the sweet surrender
[5:41:41] <gigacanuck> run woolie
[5:41:45] <+Dman1500> @Rawpost I think all of the ogre's grabs have red symbols, I might be wrong though
[5:41:46] <+MrMcCrabby> woolie just run, like actually break aggro
[5:41:46] <%lewdskeletor13> LUL
[5:41:54] <gigacanuck> keep running
[5:42:03] <%lewdskeletor13> Cowardice is a valid option
[5:42:07] <%Lion_kun> woolie the boss will regen if you take too long
[5:42:10] <Dragon_Batman> I think you gotta keep going farther
[5:42:13] <+MrMcCrabby> use stealth man
[5:42:19] <%Dman1500> Dman1500 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[5:42:19] <%CEGold> If it was Pat saying that and not Billy, the boss would climb the building LUL
[5:42:22] <LVDoomien> meanwhile woolie aggros more enemies

[5:43:40] <%Lion_kun> you're meant to side step the grabs not dodge back
[5:43:42] <gustavozxd> watching people waste the revive after seconds seems to be the best part of this game
[5:43:53] <alexandrecau> try to use oil more
[5:43:59] <+WorldsBestPanda> Woolie needs to ask Pat to teach him how to be a coward.
[5:44:00] <Nina96> is woolie or pat more ahead?
[5:44:01] <+Romuken> is Sekiro another souls?
[5:44:07] <%Rawpost> can you jump over the big grab?
[5:44:13] <CrmznOgre> I never knew how much I needed a demon doing a powerbomb in my life
[5:44:18] <%lewdskeletor13> I love how everyone seems to be an expert at this game
[5:44:21] <+Romuken> ok that's a bit cooler than souls
[5:44:36] <JeoDood> u can jump that grab^
[5:44:39] <pshuuu> the spear guy doesnt even have to come down. you can stay at the bottom of the stairs
[5:44:52] <kiraellion> The differance between us and woolie is we have working eyes. @lewdskeletor13 :P
[5:44:53] <dan_g_v> it doesn't matter who is ahead right now, Nina. Because we know Pat won't sleep for the next 15 hours while he plays
[5:45:12] <+DreyfussFrost> @lewdskeletor13 You don't need experience to see patterns.
[5:45:24] <reiju_22> pat will restart on PC I think
[5:45:27] <%lewdskeletor13> It’s like Souls but with more mobility, a more involved story, and different combat
[5:45:32] <NeetKiller> that guy comes from the left, saw him move
[5:45:33] <+thunderhog> FOOT DIVE
[5:45:40] <%komradedog> vohiyo100 Woolie, you monster. Went to my 4hr board game meet up and you’restill at it! Kudos!!!
[5:45:43] <+Romuken> that drop kick though
[5:45:48] <kiraellion> 1280 pairs of eyes on the inside
[5:46:10] <gustavozxd> if you're a true gamer you'll know the game entirely by just doing the first level Kappa
[5:46:12] <+Romuken> YOOOOOOOOOO
[5:46:16] <%CEGold> You'd think they would be programmed to fight each other
[5:46:17] <dan_g_v> dealth with, done
[5:46:17] <$burgersama_dlx> damn dude woolie's got the jukes
[5:46:19] <%Dman1500> YO TF WAS THAT DOP SHIT
[5:46:22] <+MrMcCrabby> yeyeye job that fucker
[5:46:26] <T_Sasquatch> yeyeye
[5:46:31] <dan_g_v> you should watch the elbow drop!
[5:46:32] <T_Sasquatch> use that mobility
[5:46:35] <%lewdskeletor13> It’s really weird that the ogre doesn’t attack anything else
[5:46:41] <Dragon_Batman> That was close
[5:46:43] <+Romuken> that piledriver though
[5:46:44] <kiraellion> what we dont know is you owe the giant 5$
[5:46:45] <%DashXero> You can grapple while airborne?!
[5:46:45] <alexandrecau> piece of shit try to ring you out
[5:47:00] <+MegaMillenniumX> Was is this soulcalibur
[5:47:06] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @CrmznOgre

[5:47:08] <T_Sasquatch> irip
[5:47:12] <T_Sasquatch> ohhhh
[5:47:18] <Frostilk> I wonder if he can jump off the ledge?
[5:47:25] <%DashXero> I want that Ogre in a fighting game.
[5:47:28] <kiraellion> the solution is to deliver a DDT in responce
[5:47:29] <%Sxy_T_Rex> I think you can buy more spirit emblems without resting
[5:47:29] <%lewdskeletor13> Is your fridge running too?

[5:50:30] <%Lion_kun> i was under the impression it doubled it but maybe i misread it

[5:51:36] <+MegaMillenniumX> @WoolieVersus Eat a Snickers
[5:51:43] <%lewdskeletor13> @woolieversus you just need more POWER
[5:51:44] <+Konquerer> "so i was grinding off screen for a bit"
[5:51:45] <%CEGold> We time traveling bois Kappa
[5:51:48] <Nina96> !uptime
[5:51:48] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 5 hours and 51 minutes
[5:51:53] <crossbowranger> 1 million red orbs
[5:51:59] <%yeknomlive> i think you need to watch your ds3 lp
[5:52:03] <+pittbulldogg> i think thats the easiest path.... no sure tho
[5:52:05] <%Rawpost> jumping is a legitimate strategy
[5:52:11] <jorgeniev> ITS TIME TO OIL UP
[5:52:15] <pshuuu> grinding doesnt work. everything is limited. they removed all the cheese
[5:52:18] <+pittbulldogg> there are def harder paths available now tho
[5:52:19] <%Lion_kun> there's an upgrade to get mroe spirit emblems
[5:52:21] <%CEGold> Trust me, I've been grinding for Vicar Amelia for what's felt like years cmonBruh Grinding means nadda
[5:52:27] <Atomic_Blowfish> woolie use the oil you foolish man!
[5:52:31] <%Lion_kun> check your skill tree
[5:52:42] <crossbowranger> YE YE YEEE
[5:52:43] <%GohanEgret> hakan that shit
[5:52:45] <dan_g_v> yeah, oil! Rub it hard!
[5:52:45] <Dragon_Batman> The strengths you game in the other games is from upgrading weapons and that is locked off at certain points
[5:52:48] <kiraellion> @WoolieVersus have you considered using the axe instead it specifically mentions it's good at poise breaking and it akes one less emblem. you dont get the stagger time but it might do more in the long run. also oil as you just realise
[5:52:49] <Atomic_Blowfish> hell yeah!
[5:52:56] <%Rawpost> @cegold lol feels bad
[5:52:56] <%Dman1500> woolieYE oil him up woolz
[5:52:58] <+MegaMillenniumX> You can sneak to get an immediate deathblow on Ogre
[5:53:03] <$cureneckbeard> A big part of Dark Souls is that you need player skill, so if you succeed it feels deserved
[5:53:04] <%CEGold> @Rawpost NotLikeThis
[5:53:13] <%lewdskeletor13> Get him all greasy sipsipGasm
[5:53:23] <dan_g_v> moist and nice
[5:53:25] <%GohanEgret> grease him up like groundskeeper willie
[5:53:28] <kiraellion> oiled up ogre wrestler.
[5:53:28] <%CEGold> Rub him down doodLewd
[5:53:30] <+thunderhog> so pretty much backseat if you know woolie is forgetting mechanics
[5:53:33] <gustavozxd> forgot how oil works
[5:53:36] <jorgeniev> time to do like hakkan
[5:53:37] <reiju_22> @WoolieVersus max was/is in chat
[5:53:41] <%DashXero> Make Ogre put on his Hakan cosplay.
[5:53:43] <dan_g_v> make him spin liuke certain SF fighter
[5:53:49] <%lewdskeletor13> Just don’t spoil things coming up chat
[5:53:51] <%Sxy_T_Rex> I find it counter intuitive that the key to beating this macho man is oiling him up
[5:53:55] <%lewdskeletor13> sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo
[5:53:57] <worldbrand> That guy had no idea what he saw
[5:54:08] <kiraellion> @lewdskeletor13 the end ends at some point.
[5:54:12] <puffinup> "he needs a spear" woolie please
[5:54:19] <PoisonKnuckle> DON’T HELP HIM AT ALL NOW CHAT Kappa
[5:54:39] <%GohanEgret> my best advice is to not get hit and then do big damage
[5:54:43] <dan_g_v> okay, no fire at all
[5:54:53] <+VanitasRSK> nice
[5:55:03] <%lewdskeletor13> DEATH BLOW sipsipGasm sipsipGasm sipsipGasm
[5:55:19] <crossbowranger> RULES OF NATURE!
[5:55:21] <worldbrand> I'm really liking the verticality so far
[5:55:24] <dan_g_v> Savage!
[5:55:28] <%yeknomlive> i like the spear guy
[5:55:32] <%lewdskeletor13> The mobility in this game is sick
[5:55:41] <%lewdskeletor13> I dig it
[5:55:43] <Dragon_Batman> Could have stealthed some of that
[5:55:44] <lolerez> Hey woolie have you heard about the vampire the masquerade thing?
[5:55:50] <%CEGold> He's not a Shinobi Hunter for nothing Kappa
[5:55:53] <Atomic_Blowfish> Is that fucking musashibo benkei
[5:55:57] <worldbrand> that guy just got a promotion
[5:56:07] <jorgeniev> can you even imagine what kinda shit are they gonna do for blodborne after this game?
[5:56:10] <dan_g_v> that's right, drink that Sunny D
[5:56:12] <%lewdskeletor13> You zigged when you should’ve zagged woolieMIRIN
[5:56:25] <%yeknomlive> that spear guys really is goin for it
[5:56:25] <%CEGold> I have no idea what's happening NotLikeThis
[5:56:51] <pshuuu> tactical retreat
[5:57:06] <+MegaMillenniumX> A lot of People go in guns blazing in this game, but this game really wants you to focus on stealth and strategically retreating for deathblows.
[5:57:06] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:57:12] <%lewdskeletor13> It’s not retreating, you’re just advancing backwards
[5:57:17] <pshuuu> i never used the item to return to bonfires in ds, but ive used it a shitton in this game. because theres actually a penalty
[5:57:36] <Clowns> hey :)
[5:57:37] <pshuuu> this game is really tough
[5:57:46] <+GeeWilikers1> remember to strategically advance backwards
[5:57:54] <%CEGold> @Clowns Yoo PogChamp
[5:57:54] <Shishi1205> Disengaging might be a requirement for this game
[5:57:59] <MONSTR_UwU> thought they fixed that in ds2
[5:58:03] <+GeeWilikers1> what are you playing it on?
[5:58:06] <%lewdskeletor13> You should switch it if that will help
[5:58:06] <kiraellion> itsnot tough woolie is being impatiant and not using his shinobi tools.
[5:58:07] <+machinetoys> tactical retreat into a harder mini-boss fight LUL
[5:58:16] <%Rawpost> frustration is getting bigger...
[5:58:20] <%lewdskeletor13> @kiraellion Sure Jan
[5:58:30] <jorgeniev> bang
[5:58:43] <%lewdskeletor13> bang
[5:58:45] <MONSTR_UwU> this game needs a style ranking mod
[5:58:49] <+Konquerer> bang
[5:58:51] <kiraellion> hes ignoring the shiurikens entirly
[5:59:05] <gustavozxd> the game is easy if you're good at it, just be good at it 4Head
[5:59:15] <%lewdskeletor13> BabyRage “streamer isn’t playing the way I want”
[5:59:16] <kiraellion> hes only using the axe on shields same for the flame cannon which is also his CC
[5:59:25] <crossbowranger> battery low
[5:59:26] <pshuuu> the shurikens suck tbh
[5:59:30] <%yeknomlive> he smacked the battery life right out of you
[5:59:37] <pshuuu> theyre only a stun tool vs jumping enemies
[5:59:40] <%CEGold> I don't get why your stealth attacks aggro's everyone tho. Not a very stealthy takedown if that's the case cmonBruh
[5:59:49] <+GeeWilikers1> what is this, Music outside a boss fight?
[5:59:51] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 6 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 24oz (720mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[5:59:56] <kiraellion> they also instant kill enemies like dogs.
[5:59:57] <%yeknomlive> yo is that ornstein?
[6:00:00] <%CEGold> PogChamp Out of the air
[6:00:07] <jorgeniev> maybe more stealth?
[6:00:08] <dirtyplebian> Yari Yari
[6:00:10] <crossbowranger> Wollie need sleep
[6:00:20] <+Romuken> @WoolieVersus get hydrated plz
[6:00:25] <%DashXero> Has Woolie played Tenchu before?
[6:00:25] <Shishi1205> if you're sure you gonna die don't resurrect
[6:00:27] <%lewdskeletor13> Kiraellion I had no idea you were such an expert on a game that hasn’t even released
[6:00:34] <%Rawpost> how long can you stay "dead"
[6:00:42] <%lewdskeletor13> woolieMIRIN
[6:00:50] <kiraellion> @lewdskeletor13 woolie did it once he didint even notice.
[6:01:02] <+hax_metatron> Did Woolie beat the ogre?
[6:01:06] <%lewdskeletor13> No
[6:01:06] <+MrMcCrabby> break line of sight, and crouch
[6:01:10] <%yeknomlive> maybe you can reset the encounter from hiding
[6:01:13] <+thunderhog> @WoolieVersus speaking of mechanics, have you tried poket sand on them at all?
[6:01:14] <Shishi1205> Minh is having the right idea
[6:01:17] <%Sxy_T_Rex> resetting for stealth is designed that way
[6:01:30] <crossbowranger> What do they say if you eavesdrop?
[6:01:36] <puffinup> wut
[6:01:36] <+GeeWilikers1> woolie dont want to be big coward
[6:01:37] <+maxamillion629> Minh is the voice of the people
[6:01:37] <zakti_prime> "must have just been the wind"
[6:01:37] <Dragon_Batman> You have some ceramic stuff to draw them out
[6:01:39] <+MegaMillenniumX> The last thing I'd want to do in this game is rush enemies, unprepared.
[6:01:40] <%lewdskeletor13> I can get behind Minhs reasoning here LUL
[6:01:41] <+FlyingRamen> Minh is on point lol
[6:01:42] <+machinetoys> about 2 minutes
[6:01:43] <puffinup> woolie
[6:01:44] <tearknack> YOU HAVE A STEALTH MECHANIC
[6:01:44] <%GohanEgret> see, if only woolie had played batman arkham asylum Kappa
[6:01:46] <LVDoomien> @crossbowranger 'hey let us in or you'll regret it later mrgrgr'
[6:01:47] <pshuuu> lmao
[6:01:54] <+maxamillion629> IT IS DESIGNED THAT WAY
[6:01:54] <crossbowranger> lul
[6:02:00] <gustavozxd> oh my God
[6:02:02] <jorgeniev> if you could just zandatsu in this game
[6:02:05] <%DashXero> The combat pretty much seems like a punishment for not approaching stealthily.
[6:02:05] <kiraellion> @lewdskeletor13 also consider that maybe i got an earlie copy as well?
[6:02:08] <+FlyingRamen> Woolie is being stubborn lol
[6:02:10] <dan_g_v> so, don't be seen, Woolz!
[6:02:15] <crossbowranger> Treat it like a metal gear game
[6:02:17] <+spriteuman> @jorgeniev That's be SICK
[6:02:21] <+spriteuman> *That'd
[6:02:23] <%yeknomlive> but that's not woolie's style
[6:02:27] <JanusII> Use the flowers.
[6:02:46] <%lewdskeletor13> “The game isn’t tough streamer just sucks” is always the worst hot take
[6:02:47] <jorgeniev> getting close to its last breaaaaath!
[6:02:54] <kiraellion> i never said he sucks
[6:02:55] <gustavozxd> the stealth takedown is really loud though
[6:03:00] <$burgersama_dlx> is it viable to play it like spider-man with hit and run tactics?
[6:03:01] <LVDoomien> that axe attack was really cool tho
[6:03:04] <T_Sasquatch> @lewdskeletor13 but its true Kappa
[6:03:04] <dan_g_v> that's right, go full ninja!
[6:03:04] <kiraellion> i said hes impatiant and ignoring his shinobi tools
[6:03:11] <Dragon_Batman> It's not a bad thing to not try
[6:03:13] <%lewdskeletor13> Sure Jan
[6:03:17] <%lewdskeletor13> woolieMIRIN
[6:03:22] <+thunderhog> Minh is litterally sudguesting super lame strats. then again i dont blame woolz considering his experience with Souls aggro range
[6:03:24] <+Andrizzleton> How do you GUNSWORTRICKROYALGUARD in this game?
[6:03:27] <jorgeniev> the game is hard tought
[6:03:27] <kiraellion> he had the same issue with devilbreakers in dmc6
[6:03:32] <kiraellion> 5
[6:03:34] <crossbowranger> Aye he got it
[6:03:37] <pshuuu> dude youre gonna have to be lame in this game. there are so many enemies
[6:03:38] <%yeknomlive> good
[6:03:47] <gustavozxd> @lewdskeletor13 worse than that is "game is easy if you know how to do the thing" yes man game is easy if you know how to play, who knew
[6:03:48] <+hax_metatron> Woolie a tip about jump kills: jump up in the air and plan your angle and the red dot appears with a larger window. If you drop down it’s harder
[6:03:55] <dan_g_v> we are halfway there
[6:03:59] <T_Sasquatch> you dont have to face fuck everything
[6:04:04] <%yeknomlive> woah there's a whole fogwall for this guy
[6:04:05] <%lewdskeletor13> We have an expert Woolie critiquer in Chat it seems
[6:04:16] <%lewdskeletor13> sipsipGasm sipsipGasm sipsipGasm sipsipGasm sipsipGasm
[6:04:16] <%yeknomlive> or is that a new area
[6:04:16] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[6:04:26] <%yeknomlive> >.>
[6:04:32] <+MegaMillenniumX> That's a grab
[6:04:32] <%DashXero> Cheese Louise!
[6:04:34] <AlternativeInput> BloodTrail
[6:04:35] <LVDoomien> dribble dribble dunked
[6:04:37] <+thunderhog> Christ
[6:04:37] <pshuuu> gotta dodge straight forward. the timing is lenient
[6:04:37] <zakti_prime> get outta theree
[6:04:40] <CrmznOgre> mmm...kabobs
[6:04:40] <JanusII> He clearly does that for a living.
[6:04:40] <%yeknomlive> can you jump that?
[6:04:43] <kiraellion> and your getting overly upset over something woolie litterally admitted himself. >.>
[6:04:43] <$burgersama_dlx> jump towards him when he rushes?
[6:04:51] <%lewdskeletor13> I’m loving the flow of this game, it appeals to me more than most Souls games
[6:04:51] <+Jack_Vulpes> gotta dodge towards woolie
[6:04:58] <dan_g_v> let's go with a Blood Tinge build now, how about it?
[6:05:06] <+animaniacs1126> this is truly the dark souls of dark souls
[6:05:12] <+hax_metatron> Woolie a tip about jump kills: jump up in the air and plan your angle and the red dot appears with a larger window. If you drop down it’s harder
[6:05:15] <%Sxy_T_Rex> @WoolieVersus to do the counter you step dodge towards the thrust
[6:05:19] <jorgeniev> i remember a guy who said that this game punishes you if you try to play it like a dak souls game and doge too much
[6:05:42] <dan_g_v> that was VaatiVidya, Jorge
[6:05:43] <%CEGold> @jorgeniev I think VatiVidyaa said something similar
[6:05:46] <%lewdskeletor13> Dark Souls is the Sekiro of video games
[6:05:49] <+maxamillion629> Woolie you have to figure out your ninja way before you can truely become a ninja!
[6:05:50] <crossbowranger> Is there a parry?
[6:05:56] <dan_g_v> there's a parry
[6:06:06] <pshuuu> dodging doesnt feel like it has any I-frames at all
[6:06:10] <%GohanEgret> is there a barry?
[6:06:12] <jorgeniev> what is you ninja way woolie?
[6:06:19] <%lewdskeletor13> Is there a Larry?
[6:06:20] <+VanaSkiller> it be do
[6:06:25] <dan_g_v> no, but there are probably berries
[6:06:30] <crossbowranger> I'm barry will allen the fastest man alive
[6:06:34] <%lewdskeletor13> Maybe a Harry?
[6:06:46] <meromaromiro> Hey Pat just cowarded his way through this area 30 minutes ago
[6:06:46] <%GohanEgret> is he hairy?
[6:06:57] <%CEGold> That looks so childish LUL
[6:06:58] <+maxamillion629> I know it’s old fashioned but you gotta figure out your nindo, your ninja way
[6:06:59] <dan_g_v> well, he doesn't have time to shave
[6:07:01] <+pittbulldogg> oh... this is a harder path oopsy
[6:07:15] <gustavozxd> all games need a Barry
[6:07:16] <jorgeniev> btw you can swim
[6:07:32] <%DashXero> Serpentine.
[6:07:35] <reiju_22> yeah the ogre seems much easier than spear guy
[6:07:36] <alexandrecau> serpentine
[6:07:37] <jorgeniev> aparently

[6:07:39] <%lewdskeletor13> Swimming is for cowards
[6:07:42] <zakti_prime> if fromsoft didn't want you to play bloodborne the same as dark souls, they probably don't want you to play their ninja game like dark souls either lol
[6:07:45] <crossbowranger> Does serpetine work on arrows tho?
[6:07:45] <SixthSun2> Hey, can I tell Woolz a secret here
[6:07:49] <pshuuu> bow guy in the flowers spots him every time while being camoflaged
[6:07:50] <dan_g_v> Wolves don't swim!
[6:07:56] <dan_g_v> They walk on water
[6:07:57] <gustavozxd> someone that can call you master of unlocking, make jokes in extremely dangerous situations, and is strong especially against LIVING THINGS
[6:07:59] <jorgeniev> drowning is for big dick heroes only
[6:08:00] <+maxamillion629> @zakti_prime Exactly
[6:08:15] <LVDoomien> oh now we're full coward sweet
[6:08:16] <RainMews> A level editor with Steam Workshop would make this game perfect
[6:08:25] <+Andrizzleton> truely a BRAVE and HONORABLE man!
[6:08:34] <crossbowranger> Can you assassinate the boss this way?
[6:08:35] <%lewdskeletor13> Hey chat I’m having chocolate cake and I’m not sharing any with you sipsipGasm
[6:08:36] <kiraellion> @pshuuu yeah it seems enemies spot you if they share the same area so if an enemy and you are both in flowers they will spot you.
[6:08:40] <+goose_attack_almanac> This is how Pat's been doing it until he gets impatient
[6:08:51] <gustavozxd> you need to play this game like evergrace but obviously none of you Scrublords ever played that
[6:09:01] <+maxamillion629> Is “whatever works” your nindo your ninja way?
[6:09:10] <%GohanEgret> i remember jumping around one of those rock walls in okami, laming it out is the best
[6:09:11] <AlternativeInput> is the stream a little stuttery? >.>;
[6:09:14] <+Andrizzleton> i did @gustavozxd , I did
[6:09:16] <%lewdskeletor13> Cowards Never Die
[6:09:36] <kiraellion> play it like dead cells
[6:09:38] <jorgeniev> people think i joke when i praise them for their cowardice. belive in your cowardice woolie
[6:09:39] <%yeknomlive> this is nes difficult
[6:09:44] <%Rawpost> use force spock
[6:09:50] <+pittbulldogg> all this work to die to spear guy lol
[6:09:51] <primarch_lupercal> ur a ninja
[6:09:55] <%lewdskeletor13> Believe in your own cowardice
[6:09:57] <%CEGold> @jorgeniev A true warrior knows when to retreat
[6:09:59] <%GohanEgret> remember woolie: never back down 2: the back down
[6:10:11] <crossbowranger> Can you just hit him once and run away over and over?
[6:10:12] <AmericanaRed> The backdown tech
[6:10:37] <$cashthenomad> Kotal Woolie - Too much honor.
[6:10:43] <%yeknomlive> the other method is play perfect
[6:10:43] <kiraellion> he could also try Pocketsand.
[6:10:52] <zakti_prime> if it works, it works
[6:10:53] <%lewdskeletor13> The enemies are probably super confused like “Why does this guy keep running away and coming back?”
[6:11:03] <alexandrecau> it feels like stealth killing the adds and the shinobu with flowers honestly
[6:11:11] <puffinup> no this is absolutely what you're supposed to do :P
[6:11:11] <+Konquerer> nah just lame it out
[6:11:13] <%CEGold> @lewdskeletor13 "WHy aren't we chasing him past the bridge again?"
[6:11:15] <Shishi1205> nah, fuck that
[6:11:25] <+maxamillion629> The intended way is to get a shield and raise your poise right woolie?
[6:11:25] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[6:11:25] <RainMews> Do the enemies heal themselves?
[6:11:26] <%Sxy_T_Rex> @WoolieVersus you can use the ceramic shards to lure enemies into the flowers for stealth kills
[6:11:32] <+paladinstarbuster> Ninjas used hit and run tactics
[6:11:34] <KazMkII> The intended thing is prioritizing the right enemies it seems. I'm sure you could fight them all with the I frames on the deathblows
[6:11:36] <jorgeniev> hit and run like gerrillas
[6:11:40] <jorgeniev> now
[6:11:46] <jorgeniev> YES!
[6:11:49] <meromaromiro> Mikiri
[6:11:53] <%yeknomlive> well you can just fight him normally now
[6:11:55] <dan_g_v> first try!
[6:11:55] <+FlyingRamen> YEAH BOI
[6:11:57] <puffinup> YEYEYEYEYEYEYEYE DO IT AGAIN
[6:11:57] <pshuuu> yeah enemies heal if you leave the area
[6:11:57] <reiju_22> does his health recharge if he runs away
[6:11:57] <%GohanEgret> LUL
[6:11:59] <%yeknomlive> he's isolated right?
[6:12:00] <alexandrecau> for the dragon lord bitch
[6:12:00] <+Konquerer> shinobi are the biggest cowards ever
[6:12:01] <%DashXero> Beat feet!
[6:12:02] <Spheraph> SEE YA
[6:12:07] <+Jack_Vulpes> it does recharge
[6:12:07] <%lewdskeletor13> I’m sure by the end of the game this will all seem like a cake walk
[6:12:07] <jorgeniev> WOOOP WOP WOP
[6:12:10] <XanderMagne> Nah man. Ninjas were basically Agent 47 in peasant garb just striking out at surprise.
[6:12:14] <%CEGold> Retreating is such an ugly word. I prefer to call it Gureilla Warfare Kappa
[6:12:17] <dirtyplebian> Enshin has been dishin
[6:12:18] <+KillScottKill> WOOOP WOOP WOOP gyack gyack gyack
[6:12:19] <%Rawpost> running doesn't make you a coward, it does make you a little wuss though
[6:12:20] <crossbowranger> He's mad now
[6:12:23] <$cureneckbeard> SERPENTINE
[6:12:24] <Applaudedlemon> Does woolie have makiri?
[6:12:24] <Frostilk> lmao
[6:12:27] <%DashXero> Having to kill some enemies twice seems really dumb.
[6:12:38] <%lewdskeletor13> Shadows Die Twice tho
[6:12:39] <+MrMcCrabby> he does have makiri, he tried using it earlier and kept dying
[6:12:39] <kiraellion> should note the chained ogre is not a boss it's a miniboss. the shinobi hunter is infact a boss.
[6:12:42] <dan_g_v> Woolie uses Red Bull
[6:12:47] <%CEGold> @DashXero That's how they feel about Sekiro, too Kappa
[6:12:48] <alexandrecau> makiri doesn'T work, the shinobu's timing is too off
[6:12:48] <Spheraph> Shadows Lame Twice
[6:12:48] <KazMkII> Jostar secret technique Kappa I'm that will keep working
[6:12:49] <LVDoomien> I think it's important to notice that when he executed that last archer he was standing in tall grass and wasn't immediately noticed
[6:12:57] <primarch_lupercal> nope he recharged his second life bar
[6:13:00] <Dragon_Batman> That is why they have 2 pips
[6:13:03] <crossbowranger> PAIN OF A THOUSAND DEATHS
[6:13:04] <pshuuu> shinobi hunter doesnt feel like a boss tbh
[6:13:04] <+Thilm619> Sup guys and gals
[6:13:05] <Dragon_Batman> smart
[6:13:08] <%CEGold> His health regenerates NotLikeThis
[6:13:11] <+IntegratedPaper> Sekiro: Enemies Die Twice
[6:13:14] <%lewdskeletor13> It feels like the line between mini boss and boss is very arbitrary in this game
[6:13:16] <Sparty9112> Enshin isnt that the Skaven assasination clan?
[6:13:20] <%Rawpost> @dashxero I mean the have to kill you twice so even Steven?
[6:13:21] <Applaudedlemon> Ok thanks cause Makiri is what I used to beat him did he just press circle as the prompt shows up cause that is how it works
[6:13:22] <pshuuu> there are more shinobi hunters with the same moveset, but only 1 health bar
[6:13:24] <+paladinstarbuster> Why is woolie not fighting him straight?
[6:13:24] <XanderMagne> Eshin
[6:13:25] <+dtogo> gotta get that parry down
[6:13:33] <Sparty9112> oh yeah Eshin
[6:13:33] <meromaromiro> Gotta mikiri the thrust
[6:13:34] <%yeknomlive> welp jumpin is out
[6:13:35] <reiju_22> @woolieversus please go back to the ogre LUL
[6:13:37] <T_Sasquatch> P A R R Y
[6:13:41] <crossbowranger> What if you die in the flowers?
[6:13:48] <+MrMcCrabby> jump is only out for the super lunge because its a big grab

[6:13:59] <%DashXero> @Rawpost I feel like this would be cooler if the whole revive on the spot thing weren't a thing.
[6:13:59] <jorgeniev> parry more
[6:14:07] <+PenmanLupine> the first step to winning is backing down
[6:14:15] <%FrostedZaibatsu> Sekiro in 1 hr woolieMIRIN
[6:14:15] <ivansonic08> SHI
[6:14:19] <kiraellion> should i reiterate use your shinobi tools?
[6:14:21] <T_Sasquatch> This game is literally parry god everything
[6:14:22] <%lewdskeletor13> Is the git gud disease incoming?
[6:14:27] <+dtogo> is this one off those enemies you cant parry?
[6:14:30] <Frostilk> can you parry the "grab", even though its a thrust?
[6:14:37] <%CEGold> @T_Sasquatch Royal Guard: The Game
[6:14:43] <T_Sasquatch> exact;y
[6:14:53] <%Sxy_T_Rex> @WoolieVersus to mikiri you have to step dodge directly towards the thrust
[6:14:56] <+Universal_Bojack> Sekiro: shadows parry twice Kappa
[6:15:10] <%CEGold> @Frostilk He has 2 thrust attacks the seem identicle. One's parryable, the other is unblockable
[6:15:31] <Hydrapissed> its a for honor deflect it seems
[6:15:42] <pshuuu> theres an npc at firelink. you can practice all the moves with him
[6:15:50] <%lewdskeletor13> He knows
[6:15:51] <kiraellion> i wonder if he noticed the axe gives super armor
[6:15:56] <alexandrecau> he already practiced them
[6:15:59] <+MrMcCrabby> he did pratice makiri
[6:15:59] <dan_g_v> firelink shrine is probably full on dragon rot by now
[6:16:01] <Applaudedlemon> Right as the prompt shows go for mikiri the counter has a big window

[6:16:08] <jorgeniev> oh like the lady maria fight

[6:17:16] <%CEGold> @jubejube56 Ikr? He's a ninja. Why isn't he Naruto running? cmonBruh
[6:17:23] <%Sxy_T_Rex> @WoolieVersus ceramic shards can lure enemies into the flowers
[6:17:27] <JooseNeck> Hit & run? we Cryme Tyme now?
[6:17:30] <jorgeniev> becouse he is holding a sword

[6:24:54] <kiraellion> well im out later. good luck woolie USE YER TOOLS
[6:24:54] <alexandrecau> @WoolieVersus bring the flamethrower arm as extra insurance, he probably stagger from it too
[6:25:04] <%CEGold> @crossbowranger Yeah but the occasional guess is always a welcomed suprise
[6:25:15] <+PleaseStopRyan> @ChillBillStream they're both streaming right now separately so probably not
[6:25:26] <%lewdskeletor13> @chillbillstream They’re doing Dmc 5 atm
[6:26:29] <gustavozxd> dmc5 is done
[6:26:30] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games

[6:26:56] <+DingusMcFadden> Is it true that @WoolieVersus drop kicked a motherfucker IRL, chat?
[6:26:58] <%lewdskeletor13> The recording might be done
[6:27:07] <jorgeniev> oh no this game hates dark souls players
[6:27:07] <Applaudedlemon> Be offensive don't let the posture go down
[6:27:19] <%lewdskeletor13> But the episodes are still coming out
[6:27:27] <MonocleCoyote> combat here is nothing like dark souls
[6:27:41] <Applaudedlemon> Posture is your best friend
[6:27:41] <+dtogo> I heard that items/ninja tools are legit will help alot in this game
[6:27:45] <gustavozxd> well regarding other LPs Pat said something like "I have no idea" so LUL
[6:27:46] <+Terrarp> coward your way yeah boi
[6:27:58] <reiju_22> how do you deal with multiple enemies in this game o_O
[6:27:58] <%lewdskeletor13> The game has Souls elements but combat is radically different
[6:28:05] <+PleaseStopRyan> @reiju_22 carefully
[6:28:15] <+Universal_Bojack> tactical retreat
[6:28:19] <Spheraph> This game is a Tenchu with a Souls framework
[6:28:27] <+George_W_Kushhhhh> Hey Woolie,don't know whether you'll see this but there is an incredibly crucial npc you missed at the start of this area.
[6:28:33] <gustavozxd> I remember the first nioh beta and how the fire shurikens were insanely op
[6:28:51] <tag545> bloodborne with blocking and mad jumps
[6:29:00] <alexandrecau> if you want an opening for the flame thrower he seems to have a problem if you lead him near the stairs on the right

[6:29:09] <+DingusMcFadden> Stealth-like
[6:29:11] <+dtogo> so how much of this game is just stealth?
[6:29:18] <+hadji087> hey tabarnak Woolie, how do you feel about this game so far?? just tuning in
[6:29:30] <%lewdskeletor13> When I was a kid laming a game out was so satisfying
[6:29:34] <+BaronBattle> Miyazaki worked on this too yeah?
[6:29:49] <gustavozxd> stealth seems to be pretty important
[6:30:02] <Tucker0603> @dtogo a fair bit, maybe 40% at least? probably 50?
[6:30:03] <%lewdskeletor13> It’s got estus, bonfires, homeward bone, etc. the structure is there
[6:30:05] <%Rawpost> @dtogo like 1% cause 1 kill = everyone alerted
[6:30:07] <+dtogo> laming it out more than JWong
[6:30:09] <%MForan98> @WoolieVersus you haven't seen it yet, but it feels like all the bosses have a Zelda-esk weakness that corresponds to one of your tools
[6:30:10] <+MrMcCrabby> i think you can climb up from the flowers below
[6:30:11] <Spheraph> This is a Miyazaki-directed game yes
[6:30:26] <%serranobros> I just got here and the first thing I see is woolie being a coward
[6:30:37] <+DingusMcFadden> So wait, why can't Woolie be spotted?
[6:30:37] <%lewdskeletor13> Cowardice is a valid tactic
[6:30:39] <ShinobiPhoenix> @woolieversus Never mind Dark Souls, how does this compare to Nioh since this combat is further from DS and closer to what Nioh started?
[6:30:52] <%DashXero> @serranobros Correction: The first thing you see is Woolie being SMART.
[6:31:04] <gustavozxd> this seems to be veeery different from nioh
[6:31:18] <+DingusMcFadden> It is
[6:31:34] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus I believe in you, Pat stealthed the fuck outta this guy
[6:31:37] <Spheraph> Do weapons have damage ratings in this?
[6:31:51] <+dtogo> i guess there are skills later that allow u to break aggro quicker
[6:31:52] <Applaudedlemon> Mini bosses seem to test how well you can fight while bosses seem to have prosthetic gimmicks
[6:32:05] <Tucker0603> @spheraph I think you only have the katana you start with
[6:32:09] <gustavozxd> this game is way less about stats than the souls games
[6:32:19] <Spheraph> Yeah I thought that might be the case
[6:32:27] <Spheraph> I want this to be, like, a no-numbers game
[6:32:36] <+DingusMcFadden> Yeah, trees instead of stats
[6:32:41] <reiju_22> PogChamp ?
[6:32:54] <gustavozxd> I was actually pretty happy when I heard this game wasn't gonna be about stats
[6:32:55] <+dtogo> hes doing it? PogChamp
[6:32:56] <ShinobiPhoenix> I mean like Nioh is a lot of about blocking parrying, being aggressive to keep pressure and break stamina
[6:33:22] <Applaudedlemon> Woolie try neutral dodge the mikiri counter that might help
[6:33:27] <+DingusMcFadden> Eh... when you put it like that, @ShinobiPhoenix
[6:33:40] <+DingusMcFadden> Yeah, similar base concepts
[6:33:40] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[6:33:41] <ShinobiPhoenix> Also using different weapons and fighting stances to deal with situations and people
[6:33:42] <+dtogo> is this game harder than Nioh?
[6:33:46] <MonocleCoyote> @WoolieVersus this miniboss is really easy if you unlock the counter for thrust attacks
[6:33:46] <reiju_22> yes
[6:33:49] <crossbowranger> looks like it
[6:33:53] <+DingusMcFadden> Implemented much differently
[6:33:53] <cavefishes> !uptime
[6:33:54] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 6 hours and 33 minutes
[6:34:18] <tag545> and a boop on the snoot
[6:34:18] <+dougrayman> crazy talk was activated just now over at pat
[6:34:21] <%serranobros> uh oh woolie is giving everyone the dragon rot
[6:34:23] <Tucker0603> DRAGON AIDS!!!!
[6:34:23] <+solzan2000> dat dragonrot
[6:34:24] <jorgeniev> row row
[6:34:25] <MONSTR_UwU> BibleThump
[6:34:25] <Ghost__Pantsu> I feel like one of the trappings of this game is playing it too much like a souls game. No stamina management and the heavy focus of posture system.
[6:34:34] <Applaudedlemon> @WoolieVersus Try neutral dodge for the mikiri counter instead of dodging into
[6:34:38] <AlasterAngelo> fun fact if you die enough the enemies will start dying of dragon rot
[6:34:38] <+dtogo> is the timing tight in this game?
[6:34:39] <+MegaMillenniumX> Get ready to lose Everyone
[6:34:40] <gustavozxd> probably way harder than nioh, mostly since nioh is not very hard to cheese the shit out of
[6:34:40] <%lewdskeletor13> THE GIT GUD DISEASE
[6:34:45] <ShinobiPhoenix> I feel like it might be better to come from Nioh or Bloodborne, dark Souls might be more of a hindrance to expect that
[6:34:46] <+MrMcCrabby> the combat has quite a few similarities but there are a lot of differences too
[6:34:53] <jorgeniev> question why are you not using the arm?
[6:35:03] <+DingusMcFadden> Well that's whhat you get for playing fast and loose with those dragon-people, young man
[6:35:06] <crossbowranger> Use Nero's devil arm
[6:35:08] <crossbowranger> Kappa
[6:35:19] <MonocleCoyote> @WoolieVersus you should practice the thrust counter in the temple a couple of times
[6:35:28] <+DingusMcFadden> I told you no good would come of it
[6:35:28] <alexandrecau> @WoolieVersus don'T forget to toss oil on the ogre first
[6:35:31] <gustavozxd> need to buy the mega buster dlc
[6:35:40] <Akett> It's the oil that really needs to be tried.
[6:35:43] <%lewdskeletor13> I believe in you Woolie! sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo
[6:35:44] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus have you found the firecracker arm yet?
[6:35:51] <masterfire23> @woolieversus don't forget to use the oil this time Kappa
[6:35:52] <gustavozxd> I can't get over the fact that his arm looks like the sweet surrender
[6:36:00] <Dg10262> I miss fashion souls already
[6:36:01] <+DingusMcFadden> Yeah, get dummy on these dummies
[6:36:03] <+MrMcCrabby> have you tried using air trick Kappa
[6:36:06] <jorgeniev> wolie needs more power
[6:36:07] <Atomic_Blowfish> remember the oil, woolie
[6:36:08] <Atomic_Blowfish> YES
[6:36:08] <Dragon_Batman> The fire cracker has not been found
[6:36:18] <Atomic_Blowfish> thank god
[6:36:25] <+dtogo> Is this one of those games where the beginning is the hardest part since your new and have no skills?
[6:36:29] <+DingusMcFadden> Yes, woolie needs more power Kreygasm
[6:36:30] <gustavozxd> remember woolie, GOBLINS ILL LIKE FIRE
[6:36:38] <OkamiDude15> How’s the game so far for woolie? Good i suppose?
[6:36:40] <ShinobiPhoenix> a lot of my strategy learning to play Nioh was too break or weaken stamina or at least monitor exactly when I know people can't counter me as easily.
[6:36:53] <+MrMcCrabby> bite the candy
[6:37:03] <+DingusMcFadden> Do it
[6:37:08] <+DingusMcFadden> Bite the candy, baby
[6:37:12] <crossbowranger> "Chained Ogre"
[6:37:13] <AlasterAngelo> that's fucked up man he can't even defend himself
[6:37:15] <+PenmanLupine> thank god. someone that gets the idea of using your items
[6:37:15] <Atomic_Blowfish> WOOLIE THE OIL
[6:37:26] <+MrMcCrabby> dont forget to throw the oil woolie

[6:37:46] <ZimmiZ> woolie nathanWeeb
[6:37:47] <JanusII> Past Woolie said Future Woolie should use oil.
[6:37:47] <%Rawpost> @woolieversus if you enemy step an attacking opponent you will deal posture damage
[6:37:51] <+DingusMcFadden> That's cool
[6:37:59] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Tucker0603
[6:38:00] <%serranobros> fucking elbow drops and drop kicks!
[6:38:00] <gustavozxd> rise of the imperfects Alex

[6:38:14] <gustavozxd> I can't believe rise of the imperfects is a game that exists

[6:39:00] <+animaniacs1126> octoMYGOD
[6:39:01] <+PenmanLupine> what was the plan there?
[6:39:01] <+dtogo> GORE
[6:39:01] <Atomic_Blowfish> oh my GOD
[6:39:03] <%viewingshades> oil
[6:39:04] <cavefishes> oil and fire/
[6:39:09] <%lewdskeletor13> Lather that boy uo
[6:39:10] <+dougrayman> not die?
[6:39:29] <AdrianBauer> there goes future woolie catching up to past woolie again
[6:39:35] <+PleaseStopRyan> That lunge was HUGE
[6:39:38] <$GoogleyGareth> Always sidestep those dudes, never go backwards.
[6:39:41] <+MrMcCrabby> ok well to be fair that oil didnt seem to do much
[6:39:44] <+PenmanLupine> gotta dodge to the side, not doge back when he goes for the grab
[6:39:45] <+FlyingRamen> try jumping the dives?
[6:39:47] <Applaudedlemon> @WoolieVersus Try being a big coward and lose his aggro so you can go for a backstab to remove a bar
[6:39:47] <cavefishes> fire lasted a lot longer
[6:39:48] <crossbowranger> Oil delayed him more
[6:39:51] <%DashXero> You were dealing a lot of poise.
[6:39:51] <ZimmiZ> nathanWeeb
[6:39:51] <jorgeniev> it staggered him
[6:39:57] <alexandrecau> Yes it delays him more
[6:39:59] <pwnhills> It looked like he staggered longer
[6:40:00] <+MrMcCrabby> the fire is what staggers him
[6:40:00] <Tucker0603> puts a DOT on him
[6:40:00] <+djinnJuice> yeah he was staggered for longer
[6:40:01] <tag545> wow that oil did some work
[6:40:07] <+Das_Prints> It seemed to do a slight dot.
[6:40:18] <%lewdskeletor13> Got lather that Ogre in oil my dude
[6:40:20] <+MrMcCrabby> a very very slight dot
[6:40:27] <%Rawpost> it gave him a fire debuff?

[6:41:36] <Tucker0603> @dashxero damn it man, I can hear that in my pawn's voice

[6:55:37] <+BurkeBigsby> GT kid goku probably gonna have SS4 Lvl 3. That's why.
[6:55:39] <+dougrayman> i've always liked ssj4 transformation
[6:55:40] <%BurncoatRapscallion> Piccolo Jr. saga Goku was amazing
[6:55:57] <gustavozxd> be glad it's not SAO talk

[6:56:38] <Royal8383> Janemba and Pikkon would be so gnarly
[6:56:44] <Cymen90> @leviathan666303 That is not a boss tho
[6:56:48] <Youwereeatenbyalid> KATAMARI DAMACY

[0:19:08] <%lewdskeletor13> Yeah I haven‚Äôt looked at anything for Origami King yet but I hope it‚Äôs good! Obviously it won‚Äôt be like this game but I hope it‚Äôs still enjoyable

[0:19:25] <mar_krow> woolieGLORY
[0:19:26] <CybermanAnon> so.... question, if I wanna make a WoolieVS animated, what's the best course of action? make it and upload it, then send the link to woolie? or finish it sent it to woolie see if he aprooves and then upload it? I've never done an animated for a youtube channel so I don't know if there's an "ettiquete code"
[0:19:30] <Prevot> the last 2 weren't fine
[0:19:39] <HereComestheChief> I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be enjoyable on it‚Äôs own merits
[0:19:39] <%lewdskeletor13> Yea I just preorder Ghost of Tsushima the other day, very hyped
[0:19:42] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @MasterMushin This isnt SaktyBet LUL
[0:19:44] <%koolaid_kevster> wwait what does his stand do?
[0:19:47] <+Ben_TheRoadrage_Miller> what have you all been playing recently ?
[0:19:48] <%chosenjuan42> I remember regretting sticker star
[0:20:00] <%chosenjuan42> Been playing Animal Crossing
[0:20:02] <MasterMushin> @BallerSwagBro9k !bet ? Kappa
[0:20:03] <$Futurecity10> What is this song it sounds familiar
[0:20:05] <twieetcha> Sticker star was supposed to be a lot cooler apparently
[0:20:08] <%lewdskeletor13> I‚Äôve been playing RDR2 to pass the time before Tsushima
[0:20:09] <Prevot> Sticker Star may be the worst piece of media to have the Mario name on it
[0:20:14] <%HitchhikingThrough> @Futurecity10 main battle music for Into The Breach
[0:20:20] <%SomersaultJustice> Hotel Mario tho
[0:20:23] <$Futurecity10> Ah that‚Äôs right
[0:20:30] <$Futurecity10> Danke
[0:20:31] <Prevot> @SomersaultJustice I stand by what I said
[0:20:34] <%paladinstarbuster> @CybermanAnon make it and post it to the subreddit is what others have done
[0:20:37] <%chosenjuan42> lol
[0:20:38] <+Ben_TheRoadrage_Miller> Wait, is Sticker Star THAT bad ?
[0:20:42] <%chosenjuan42> die on the hill
[0:20:42] <Papa_Bearman> This year may suck, but I'm about to have a telemeeting for work while watching Woolie on streem, so...silver linings.
[0:20:43] <%Irridium> god damn Into the Breach's OST is so fucking good
[0:20:44] <Mrbaconator> yes
[0:20:44] <HereComestheChief> It‚Äôs uh
[0:20:48] <roguemephilesclone> That Paper Mario interview filled me with despair. The footage I've seen of later game Origami King gameplay looks unfocused out of battle and tedious in. I ain't about it. Gonna' enjoy this LP and maybe start Bug Fables soon instead.
[0:20:51] <+duckmeat_woohoo> What song is this from
[0:20:56] <GenericSoda> the snow chapter is probably the only goid part of sticker star
[0:21:03] <$Futurecity10> Sticker star is worse than omicron
[0:21:08] <MasterMushin> @roguemephilesclone what interview? I'm curious
[0:21:09] <GenericSoda> no its not
[0:21:09] <%Irridium> @duckmeat_woohoo Into the Breach
[0:21:10] <Someguy893> Into the Breach?
[0:21:14] <+Ben_TheRoadrage_Miller> did it stray too far from the original RPG mechanics ?
[0:21:15] <%HitchhikingThrough> I can testify that sticker star is bad because I played a few hours of it on my friends 3DS when I was younger and my immediate feeling was "this is somehow not fun, and I don't know why." When kid you can make that judgement, you know shit sucks
[0:21:16] <%Solidnick18> SourPls

[0:21:49] <CybermanAnon> @paladinstarbuster like... directly on the reddit? or sending a link to the animation? cause my plan is to upload it to Newgrounds
[0:21:49] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @CybermanAnon you see, you first make it and upload it, then shout out to woolie after a while. This nets maximum likes, it's the optimal playstyle. No but seriously just at woolie when it's done, and post it on the subreddit too and you'll be golden
[0:21:53] <%chosenjuan42> I felt poison forest was the only one with a side plot besides getting sticker star

[0:35:24] <NeroInfinite> weebs sit back down.
[0:35:26] <+Kickin_Against_the_Switz> I JUST learned he made that, why did Spike Lee want to adapt that??? It's so outside his norm
[0:35:27] <%chosenjuan42> It shouldn't matter
[0:35:32] <Nekros4442> This is not a subs vs dubs argument in the case of Old Boy
[0:35:32] <%RedoctoberWolf> watch king of the hill in its original form
[0:35:33] <+StooEsq> Haven't seen Spike Lee's Oldboy? Don't worry about it, you're good.
[0:35:34] <+noajenkk> STILL CORRECT BTW
[0:35:38] <+TheDyingPride> dub quality has gotten so much better in recent years
[0:35:38] <RichochetForce> Dubs led to the Bible Black scene in the outro.
[0:35:39] <%jiggy_snipe> dub quality has improved
[0:35:40] <%ekodrop> it's still like that
[0:35:41] <+zooeymainbtw> Still is
[0:35:42] <Rhinoprotoss> What a weeb
[0:35:42] <+ClericOfSparda> The American Oldboy is not terrible. It's not as good as the original, but it's still good.
[0:35:42] <%HitchhikingThrough> welp; will try one more time when gameplay starts I guess
[0:35:44] <%SmoothEnigma> SmoothEnigma subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[0:35:45] <Nekros4442> Spike Lee's old boy is just a terrible adaptation
[0:35:45] <%Exiliator> Still correct :)
[0:35:45] <%Totally_not_toby> that was the way of the world back then
[0:35:45] <RichochetForce> But Dubs are way better now.
[0:35:46] <%brachydios777> I don‚Äôt even get why Spike Lee even remade that
[0:35:51] <BreakersAweigh> dubs have gotten really good recently
[0:35:52] <+Ancopro> dubs omnomnom
[0:35:53] <+zooeymainbtw> dubs have gotten WORSE
[0:35:53] <%Solidnick18> i just watch both but it depends on the series.
[0:35:53] <%brachydios777> But DBZ
[0:35:56] <glass_marcus> Honestlu....I miss bad dubs. Dubs are too good now
[0:35:59] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Most dubs are still meh. But some are great
[0:36:01] <time_axis> the duality of man
[0:36:02] <+MeatBomb> Having your translation filtered twice used to be horrible, but it's getting much better.
[0:36:03] <RichochetForce> @zooeymainbtw Not in games
[0:36:03] <+LoVezineTheAir> DBZ only exception
[0:36:03] <%jiggy_snipe> but you have teletoon Kappa
[0:36:05] <%RedoctoberWolf> they have a few special cases of good dubs
[0:36:07] <%Irridium> dubs are solid these days
[0:36:11] <+linSP> I can‚Äôt into granny goku
[0:36:12] <%gatorafan> Latino dubs were cool tho, haven't seen them in a while
[0:36:15] <overlord_nico> Baccano was a great dub
[0:36:15] <%chosenjuan42> YEAH DBZ DUB
[0:36:16] <%TheOddJik> there are plenty of good dubs nowadays
[0:36:16] <Nekros4442> Nah, DBZ Abridged is still the best
[0:36:17] <%ChoculaUltra> Baccano's dub was dope too
[0:36:18] <atomicxdj> dont forget the french version Woolie
[0:36:20] <Jonny_Uppercut> Yu Yu Hakusho dub ayaLEWD
[0:36:21] <Snakes_dk> i grew up with subs so its no issue
[0:36:22] <NotHereToStream> my boy wbop
[0:36:23] <+IceyCone> I think dubs are fine. its really a matter of preference to me
[0:36:24] <%brachydios777> Also Beebop
[0:36:24] <OldOnyx> still mostly correct at least. There are just more exceptions these days
[0:36:25] <%axe_lobo_galen> wolf's rain and cowboy bebop are the best dubs hands down
[0:36:25] <atomicxdj> for the Quebec peeps
[0:36:26] <+Keyblade97> yuyu hakusho
[0:36:28] <+Ancopro> yeaaa true
[0:36:28] <%Totally_not_toby> ocean dub....... I miss you.........
[0:36:30] <%DatAsuna> durarara
[0:36:31] <%sunnythedrunk> Best dubs are DBZ, CowBoy Bebop, and Samurai Champloo
[0:36:36] <%andrex2311> PASWG dub is soooooooooo good
[0:36:40] <%Irridium> Cromartie High School dub is thankfully really great
[0:36:42] <jase__x> Not even Questionable IT IS BETTER
[0:36:42] <glass_marcus> I've never watched Space Dandy subbed and I never will
[0:36:43] <%prime_name> I'd say the FMAB dub is better...but recent events...
[0:36:44] <+genowyn> Baccano dub is great
[0:36:44] <+Deano8817> ghost stories tho
[0:36:44] <RichochetForce> @andrex2311 Agreed
[0:36:46] <fault_417> Yu Yu Hakusho‚Äôs terrific dub
[0:36:47] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @DatAsuna An a fellow person of culture
[0:36:48] <scorpionoutcast> First anime I ever saw was FMA dubbed
[0:36:50] <BearSawed> Beck has an awsome dub
[0:36:53] <%brachydios777> Dbz kai‚Äôs dub is pretty good specifically
[0:36:53] <%twoto858> Yo, there's an interview article with Origami King's development team
[0:36:53] <%chosenjuan42> MY HERO MACADAMIA is good too
[0:36:54] <+noajenkk> agreed reggie
[0:36:56] <+r_Foeburden87> thats RAW though so you know
[0:36:56] <vaderxyz1970> Golden Boy dub is a FACT
[0:37:00] <MattDemers> Subs make me pay attention instead of zoning out and watching on another monitor.
[0:37:01] <+ConLin_Arts_> I prefer subs but awesome that people love dubs!
[0:37:03] <grimshuck> Big O is pretty good. Dat steve blum
[0:37:03] <%Mr_Ease> Code Geass dub is actually superior to sub, only time I've seen it happen
[0:37:04] <%Chatterbox1991> Gundam Wing, Code Geass.
[0:37:04] <+noajenkk> OG version will always be better
[0:37:05] <+zooeymainbtw> subs are mostly still the best
[0:37:06] <%elbigante> "woolie's not anti-dub, that's just how he was brought up"
[0:37:11] <%jiggy_snipe> Ghost Stories Dub tho
[0:37:17] <+hi_imjams> People who watch Cowboy Bebop subbed are nerds
[0:37:19] <+Ben_TheRoadrage_Miller> TRUE
[0:37:22] <%chosenjuan42> GHOST STORIES BEST DUB
[0:37:26] <zamzoph> problem with subs is that it's difficult to pseudo-watch anime unless it's something you've already seen before
[0:37:29] <+ConLin_Arts_> DansGame
[0:37:29] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:37:30] <%Irridium> Ghost in the Shell dubbed is also real good
[0:37:38] <+Mettic> i watched the shin godzilla dub and it was so bad but was really funny
[0:37:39] <Nekros4442> Are we talking about Spike Lee's Old boy?
[0:37:40] <the_saltiest> DansGame
[0:37:41] <%RedoctoberWolf> EH HEH HEH URAMESHI
[0:37:41] <+ConLin_Arts_> eeee
[0:37:42] <+Kickin_Against_the_Switz> Wait....they dubbed Old Boy??????
[0:37:44] <+ConLin_Arts_> eeeew
[0:37:44] <redrins> jesus why would they dub old boy
[0:37:45] <%DesDavis> I play Metro 2033 in Russian
[0:37:47] <%chosenjuan42> @jiggy_snipe Soo good
[0:37:49] <Prevot> that's a weird thing about north america, cause the rest of the world watches all your movies dubbed
[0:37:49] <WG101> @Kickin_Against_the_Switz yeah
[0:37:50] <%Josef_Stryker> Baccano has a godlike dub imo
[0:37:51] <RichochetForce> @Irridium That was an amazing group
[0:37:59] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Some dubs also completely make the anime (Ghost Stories and My First Girlfriend's A Gal)
[0:38:04] <+Juriasu> give them the 20-page manual before you recommend the movie
[0:38:04] <+magiclottie> film dubbing is a nightmare
[0:38:07] <%Solidnick18> yeah i can't do that the mouth sync just bothers me
[0:38:08] <%brachydios777> Jojo dubbed is still kinda weird but I really like Joseph‚Äôs English VA
[0:38:09] <+Ben_TheRoadrage_Miller> Subtitles literally taught me English because I was hearing it in the background
[0:38:16] <+r_Foeburden87> First girlfriend is GAL dub is indeed great
[0:38:17] <+Kickin_Against_the_Switz> I didn't think people were still dubbing love action movies, that's insane.
[0:38:19] <+magiclottie> i also have friends who because of various mental things CANT look at subtitles
[0:38:21] <%prime_name> I never watch anything live-action dubbed
[0:38:24] <overlord_nico> Ladd Russo sold the entirety of Baccano
[0:38:25] <%khalcipher> but thera are times when the subtitles solve voice acting problems like with the star wars prequels and the spanish dub.
[0:38:28] <Equirah> @Corporate_Redeemer those titles alone LUL
[0:38:29] <+Kickin_Against_the_Switz> live action*
[0:38:33] <+veget188> @WoolieVersus have you seen volcano high dub
[0:38:36] <+GiantRatThatMakesTheRulz> that's how my dad is with subtitles
[0:38:41] <%prime_name> Maybe a Godzilla movie, but those are expectations to the rules
[0:38:43] <%gatorafan> But it's not from AMERICA
[0:38:47] <+LoVezineTheAir> Didn't the korean subtitles for Infinity War spoil the ending?
[0:38:49] <Nekros4442> But the Oscars say that only Western movies mean anything
[0:38:54] <%Lion_kun> Ghost of Tsushima japenese doesnt match the mouth flaps
[0:39:01] <%Irridium> if you play video games with subtitles you are more cultured than the majority of movie watchers and the Academy
[0:39:05] <%kyh9> Well Illiteracy rates are pretty high in the US
[0:39:07] <%jiggy_snipe> I don't think live-action should be dubbed
[0:39:09] <@akuda_bar> akuda_bar subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! live lps are a hoax, reggie wrote all of woolie's lines in advance, including this one, and the one after it.
[0:39:09] <%chosenjuan42> true not a big deal
[0:39:09] <Nekros4442> @Lion_kun developed by an American studio
[0:39:12] <+hi_imjams> @WoolieVersus I prefer dubs for anime/video games but dubbed live action is disgusting
[0:39:16] <%Corporate_Redeemer> @equirah Telling your VAs that the anime is gonna suck anyways and to do whatever they want can lead to some true greatness
[0:39:17] <benbag13> but I want to watch a film not read it
[0:39:21] <+noajenkk> LUL
[0:39:22] <+chosenjuan42> not a big deal but options are good
[0:39:22] <%RedoctoberWolf> but our american school system sucks people can't read
[0:39:28] <+zooeymainbtw> Gal dub is trash
[0:39:29] <%brachydios777> @nekros4442 So glad Parasite won to change some things up
[0:39:30] <%Lion_kun> But its a japanese setting. Be authentic
[0:39:36] <+ConLin_Arts_> I speak Swedish so I spent a lot of my life watching american stuff with Swedish subs
[0:39:41] <+Kickin_Against_the_Switz> Like I've seen it said online, I didn't even notice I was reading subtitles in Parasite, it's so immersive
[0:39:48] <Snakes_dk> when you get used to subs its nok hard
[0:39:51] <%chosenjuan42> KILL LA KILL is good dub too
[0:39:54] <wix964> literally who, in this community, would argue against subs
[0:39:56] <the_saltiest> fooly cooly!
[0:39:57] <glass_marcus> Agreed
[0:40:04] <%SmoothEnigma> I mean STRONGLY prefer dubs, but even I know when it's time to switch to subbed for something
[0:40:06] <the_saltiest> that's my jam
[0:40:06] <%Irridium> FLCL dub is fucking kills it. It's fantastic
[0:40:09] <%emperordread> Excel Saga is definitely an anime watcher's anime
[0:40:13] <%ChoculaUltra> feeling a bit fooly, maybe a bit cooly idk might delete later

[0:40:32] <+Ancopro> if its a show i really like I'll watch both versions
[0:40:36] <iccehot1> been watching your kotor 2 play through and its very fun.
[0:40:46] <CybermanAnon> That Excel Saga ending tho!
[0:40:47] <%YakumoYomi> How is Konosuba's dub, by the way?
[0:40:47] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Let's not forget that a LOT of Western anime fans first got introduced to anime through DUBBED DBZ
[0:40:47] <%elbigante> elbigante subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! shoutout to baccano's dub invalidating the sub
[0:40:48] <%ozmon> Cromartie High School dub not only nails how stupidly surreal it is, but makes a brand of its own to paint a whole layer of humor over everything else it has going on
[0:40:49] <+hi_imjams> its all just preference at the end of the day
[0:40:49] <%chosenjuan42> BOBOBO is much more random in dub since he can't do the Japanese puns
[0:40:51] <+StooEsq> Jessica Cavello?
[0:40:55] <scorpionoutcast> Excel Saga felt like taking crack
[0:40:59] <%brachydios777> I agree on that stories in foreign nations sound more natural in their native languages, at the least in their accents
[0:41:01] <%paladinstarbuster> Most dubs are fine

[1:38:57] <noe_juan_kanobe> Sword Pierce

[1:39:00] <missingangle> it's not bad, tbh
[1:39:01] <SixthSun2> And more

[1:39:06] <NiktenKing> First attack
[1:39:07] <fault_417> Are we still telling him to remove W Emlem
[1:39:07] <twieetcha> Remove first attack
[1:39:09] <MyNameIsRasus> First attack?
[1:39:09] <%SchwaAkari> It can hit the back row, and more importantly it can hit the ceiling
[1:39:09] <hassanico2> Can it hit Clefts and Spiky enemies?
[1:39:10] <+Kickin_Against_the_Switz> Use 2 FP to hit the back Kappa Kappa Kappa
[1:39:11] <BigDaddyofCincinnati> first attack
[1:39:11] <Papa_Bearman> First Attack can go.
[1:39:11] <+gearcannon> first attack

[1:39:15] <%Chatterbox1991> Tutor
[1:39:16] <NiktenKing> you are fighting new enemies
[1:39:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> first attack isn't useful now
[1:39:16] <SixthSun2> First Attack isn't useful right now
[1:39:17] <niozonbi> And flying enemies
[1:39:19] <+marumariball> yeah first attack
[1:39:20] <+magiclottie> first attack is doing literally nothing right now
[1:39:21] <+Grayhammatter> possibly first attack
[1:39:23] <benbag13> first attack
[1:39:23] <Hyper_charger> first attack sucks
[1:39:23] <%hawk_rush> good call!
[1:39:27] <grimshuck> It can also hit enemies on the ceiling
[1:39:27] <+Wilabeen1997> First attack
[1:39:30] <%SomersaultJustice> Sneaky Surprise Attack at the Start of the Second Round
[1:39:32] <scorpionoutcast> Back row, air, that hammer gets around
[1:39:38] <hectic_harlequin> When in doubt

[1:40:10] <MyNameIsRasus> Anything is blowable if you have a strong enough jaw
[1:40:12] <sileo_patronus> So does hammer throw make the Hammer-only badge not suicide?
[1:40:17] <exnuart> when in doubt flurrie out

[1:56:05] <+AJiiij> its weak if I remember tho
[1:56:07] <%heartlesshealer> maybe fire dive...
[1:56:08] <%eriksdrums> Hitting Z to sort by FP will help with your badge management
[1:56:11] <noe_juan_kanobe> Tornado Jump Slyish is dope
[1:56:11] <+Wilabeen1997> Put quake back on
[1:56:12] <kulmoth> fuck charge
[1:56:13] <sirmcslushers> Level Up soonish
[1:56:14] <Hyper_charger> timing tutor
[1:56:15] <+Rosen_Thorne> but so did the regular hammer
[1:56:16] <Louie_Salmon> Power Smash isn't getting used
[1:56:16] <%NopeBadguy> Hammer Throw is just a normal hammer as a projectile
[1:56:19] <%NopeBadguy> It's not good
[1:56:19] <Papa_Bearman> Turn off the W Emblem for this chapter, please.
[1:56:20] <GodlyLuigi> hammer throw is base level damage
[1:56:20] <%TheLemuroid> Doesn't hammer throw = normal hammer
[1:56:21] <damienlunas> Put it on just to try?
[1:56:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> but that was the only thing you tried LUL
[1:56:24] <+TheDyingPride> Hammer throw doesn't do any bonus damage.
[1:56:24] <bbblaketwitching> 1 is less than VIOLENCES base attack
[1:56:25] <%hawk_rush> just wait til you level up
[1:56:25] <+Grayhammatter> i think you're pretty good, you'll get a level soon
[1:56:25] <%SchwaAkari> I like how we're just calling them Spiky Joe from now on
[1:56:26] <%Totally_not_toby> hammer throw just does regular hammer damage woolie
[1:56:27] <autcetera> Normal hammer hurt it too Woolz
[1:56:28] <SiegeJay> Quick change
[1:56:30] <JeoDood> hammer throw or FP
[1:56:31] <+AJiiij> what does power plus do
[1:56:34] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> any hammer throw is base damage
[1:56:35] <glass_marcus> Power smash is good but you don't use it
[1:56:36] <+Rosen_Thorne> i say ditch charge for mario as the power plus negates it
[1:56:36] <zoopbooploop> Hammer Throw is bad
[1:56:37] <+Wilabeen1997> Hammer throw = normal hammer
[1:56:37] <HiddenDM> Hammer throw is just a regular hammer attack.
[1:56:38] <JetpackMcQuack> I love badges
[1:56:39] <nxflre> but charge and power bounce tho
[1:56:39] <RandomAccess64> Hammer Throw does the same damage as your normal hammer
[1:56:39] <Nyerp> hammer throw is good for the bats
[1:56:42] <+BurningLlama777> Bless you
[1:56:43] <%heartlesshealer> hammer throw works for flying enemies is the thing
[1:56:47] <%Chatterbox1991> GASP
[1:56:49] <+marumariball> FP plus maybe?
[1:56:50] <Leddy_at_Home> @AJiiij +1 to damage
[1:56:51] <+AJiiij> good call
[1:56:52] <MyNameIsRasus> Hammer throw is just normal hammer dmg but ranged
[1:56:52] <bbblaketwitching> 1 damage
[1:56:56] <+Rosen_Thorne> it's not bad. it's the same damage.
[1:56:56] <lambishly> Hammer Throw is good
[1:56:57] <BreakersAweigh> hammer throw is great
[1:56:58] <+Grayhammatter> FP plus possibly?
[1:56:59] <%heartlesshealer> Hammer throw = anti-air
[1:56:59] <%Totally_not_toby> it
[1:57:00] <missingangle> It's really not bad. It's good
[1:57:00] <noe_juan_kanobe> FP?
[1:57:01] <+marumariball> hammer through is good
[1:57:01] <%hawk_rush> i think get rid of fire drive, and put quake hammer too
[1:57:02] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it's not bad but it's not better than regular hammer
[1:57:02] <fault_417> Remove the W emblem for this chapter :(
[1:57:02] <shiny_prinny> hammer throw is fine
[1:57:03] <nxflre> charge+power bounce is an OP combo tho
[1:57:05] <%RedoctoberWolf> i would take off fire drive and hammer throw and get quake hammer/tornado
[1:57:05] <+AJiiij> ah ok thanks leddy
[1:57:07] <autcetera> Hammer thro may be good for flying Spiky Joes actually
[1:57:07] <%paladinstarbuster> woolieONEGUY
[1:57:07] <jetboots> what about quake hammer?
[1:57:10] <%Totally_not_toby> it's not bad but it's the same amount of damage
[1:57:10] <zoopbooploop> Hammer Throw does the same damage as the regular hammer
[1:57:10] <+magiclottie> hammer throw is good
[1:57:10] <StryfeDragon> You can keep it, just know it does the same damage as your regular hammer
[1:57:11] <+pectusumbra> maybe piercing hammer for right now?
[1:57:13] <%BisoromiBear> the best badges are the ones you enjoy using
[1:57:19] <%eriksdrums> If you hit Z you can sort by FP cost
[1:57:22] <Louie_Salmon> Power Smash isn't very useful when you already have a hammer move
[1:57:24] <Prevot> do you really need power smash
[1:57:26] <%KyoryUtchy> Hammer throw does same damage as regular hammer fyi
[1:57:27] <thetntm> You were using hammer throw incorrectly - it deals the same damage as base hammer
[1:57:32] <%HitchhikingThrough> Oh yeah while we're doing badge stuff, W Emblem breaks stuff in this chapter. Might want to remove it

[2:19:58] <nxflre> gate
[2:20:02] <sirmcslushers> We trying out Lucky Start?
[2:20:04] <%MonsterEnvy> You can open the gate from the back
[2:20:05] <+TheDyingPride> eventually isn't today
[2:20:08] <%NopeBadguy> You can unlock the gate from the inside
[2:20:09] <GodlyLuigi> i do fear woolie is gonna get decked with that 15 hp of his some point later but eh
[2:20:09] <notsoy> is power smash even useful anymore now that we have super hammer?
[2:20:10] <%chosenjuan42> gate
[2:20:10] <scorpionoutcast> No holding back!
[2:20:12] <pookam> and it neeeever came back as a machanic.......
[2:20:13] <Papa_Bearman> You can unlock that gate from the inside, by the way.
[2:20:14] <Emptyskull> Never not BP
[2:20:19] <nxflre> open gate from other side
[2:20:30] <%cdrom321> Max BP is 30 in PM64, but it's 99 here.
[2:20:32] <pookam> make something good happen!
[2:20:32] <%chosenjuan42> you can open gate from other side woolieONEGUY
[2:20:33] <%kingkeldeo31> zap tap
[2:20:39] <DapperHatwell> Just put it on
[2:20:41] <+Lazyjoules> Lucky Start
[2:20:42] <morat2255> Power smash is kinda trash
[2:20:42] <twieetcha> BP all the way woolie I love it
[2:20:47] <%FusRoDom> SOMETHING G O O D
[2:20:49] <frankyvalli> Drop Tornado
[2:20:52] <morat2255> hammer throw would be really good with hammerman badge
[2:20:59] <NiktenKing> LUCKY STAR t
[2:20:59] <Leddy_at_Home> You can change sorting method
[2:20:59] <SixthSun2> Sure, that's solid
[2:21:00] <%NopeBadguy> Remind me, does Quake hit ceiling in this game?
[2:21:03] <Prevot> drop power smash
[2:21:05] <%The_Timo> Tornado Jump is too situational, if the enemies aren't in mid air it hits nothing
[2:21:09] <Papa_Bearman> Tornado is too situational.
[2:21:09] <StryfeDragon> Tornado is very niche imo
[2:21:10] <+Grayhammatter> fair enough
[2:21:12] <+TheDyingPride> Quake does hit ceiling
[2:21:13] <Shwepie> @notsoy Can be, but I think there's more use out of piercing blow.
[2:21:15] <%ividboy> @nopebadguy it does
[2:21:21] <+zooeymainbtw> tornado not great
[2:21:25] <%RedoctoberWolf> can get rid of fire drive
[2:21:25] <%JD_Lars> Max BP is 99, right?
[2:21:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> what about piercing?
[2:21:27] <restingbones> what is "something good" woolie? maybe find out?
[2:21:29] <al0nem0nster> too bad they didn't allow build saving, then you could hot swap before fighting.
[2:21:31] <Emptyskull> Tornado only good for flyers
[2:21:32] <noe_juan_kanobe> Tornado stylish is dope, tho
[2:21:41] <pookam> tornado has an ankle bracelet
[2:21:41] <@akuda_bar> now people will stop saying that 30 BP is the cap
[2:21:43] <%NopeBadguy> Fire Drive is only useful against elemental weaknesses, which is too rare in this game
[2:21:48] <RandomAccess64> You can unlock the gate from the inside
[2:21:51] <%chosenjuan42> The gate can open from inside
[2:21:55] <%NopeBadguy> Isn't the cap 99
[2:21:56] <@Menitta> lol you can get 99 bp
[2:21:56] <the_saltiest> @akuda_bar That's PM 64 :p
[2:22:02] <Mako_Kreutzev> 30 BP is the brrap
[2:22:04] <atomicxdj> dont forget the gate Woolie

[2:22:10] <%KoopaPrez> Did we meet the new friend yet?
[2:22:13] <StryfeDragon> @NopeBadguy Fire Drive does good damage even without a weakness, it's just expensive to use
[2:22:16] <exnuart> no
[2:22:18] <+Lazyjoules> Fire drive is so hype that he'll never take it off, that's just an L we're gonna gave to take

[2:31:05] <twieetcha> Yes
[2:31:05] <+Wilabeen1997> Stairs moved
[2:31:07] <+BurningLlama777> In Animal Crossing I had a 10,000 bell tree bloom. Just thought I'd announce that like a dillweed
[2:31:11] <%Asuterisuku> Gap in the fence there.
[2:31:14] <%chosenjuan42> is Dio at the top of stairs?
[2:31:15] <Papa_Bearman> Stop with the pickle stone. Not funny anymore.
[2:31:15] <%Solidnick18> big steeple
[2:31:16] <DeepSearch27> Round Trip is excellent
[2:31:26] <twieetcha> That‚Äôs amazing! I never get 10k trees
[2:31:27] <Potatoidea> Cucumber Rock

[2:31:33] <%blaze__drag> pickle stone is the funniest shit I've ever seen
[2:31:35] <atomicxdj> Dill pebble
[2:31:39] <noe_juan_kanobe> Flurrie can slam right?
[2:31:40] <%ingman112> It‚Äôs a good way to disseminate information though
[2:31:44] <DeepSearch27> I kid you not
[2:31:46] <+TheDyingPride> I think flurry can hit that high for free
[2:31:48] <%ingman112> Keep spoilers out of the limelight
[2:31:49] <GodlyLuigi> smol swoop

[2:32:01] <NotHereToStream> smol
[2:32:03] <%chosenjuan42> flurrie can hit
[2:32:05] <%FuqBoiSlim> haha
[2:32:06] <pochecito> it's a kirby
[2:32:07] <Ookamiden02> '-'
[2:32:08] <Mako_Kreutzev> do you think yoshi is embarrassed to poop eggs
[2:32:13] <sirmcslushers> Fence tho
[2:32:15] <HereComestheChief> lytWIPED
[2:32:20] <Papa_Bearman> Go back right.
[2:32:20] <%Asuterisuku> There's a gap in the fence you can go through.
[2:32:21] <BreakersAweigh> hmmmmmmm
[2:32:22] <the_saltiest> ü§î
[2:32:30] <+BurningLlama777> Do you think Yoshi makes eggs after every meal haha just asking for a friend haha
[2:32:31] <%lewdskeletor13> Hmmmm
[2:32:37] <CrematedCube> Just arrived, so we're here in Byrgenwyrth eh?
[2:32:38] <GodlyLuigi> i dont want to think about the fact that baby yoshi's can immediately produce their own eggs
[2:32:40] <%RedoctoberWolf> brain map laid out
[2:32:49] <%tigerfang86> L E A F
[2:32:53] <pookam> tasty
[2:32:56] <%cobalt_phoenix_> A FUCKING LEAF
[2:32:58] <%ividboy> WHAT
[2:32:59] <%RedoctoberWolf> its a recipe that isn't rng
[2:33:01] <Papa_Bearman> That would make some tasty tea. HINT HINT.
[2:33:02] <CocoonMoon> Hidden leaf
[2:33:03] <%Solidnick18> zess t maybe
[2:33:04] <hassanico2> Gold Leaf? Like the stuff that covers metal?
[2:33:04] <+desfore> Recipe item
[2:33:04] <the_saltiest> leaf, eh?
[2:33:05] <twieetcha> Oh that‚Äôs good!

[2:33:06] <SixthSun2> Ah, the most annoying recipie item to get
[2:33:07] <SpaceLTN> day of the rake soon
[2:33:07] <notsoy> imagine that tea
[2:33:07] <Ookamiden02> SECRET: A LEAF
[2:33:09] <%lewdskeletor13> Do you think the Hot Dog guy raises the Yoshi‚Äôs and then kills them for the hot dogs
[2:33:10] <CybermanAnon> will it cook?
[2:33:12] <Mako_Kreutzev> yoshies are born pregnant
[2:33:15] <NiktenKing> A totally not RNG recipe
[2:33:16] <chromdad> A FUCKING LEAF
[2:33:17] <%kingkeldeo31> You get one per screen load i think
[2:33:18] <+Snipershot489> I didn‚Äôt even know this wtf
[2:33:21] <morat2255> Gold leaf, can trim rune armor for 500k
[2:33:22] <%chosenjuan42> I never found that first playthrough
[2:33:35] <chromdad> DAY OF THE RAKE
[2:33:42] <noe_juan_kanobe> Mix up
[2:33:54] <%sunnythedrunk> Day of Rakening
[2:33:56] <al0nem0nster> "The in-game Japanese text of Yoshi's Trophy in Super Smash Bros. Melee states that Yoshis reproduce asexually, meaning that they reproduce without a mate and are neither male nor female." So neat those are actual eggs.
[2:33:59] <%chosenjuan42> @noe_juan_kanobe hello fellow Juan guy
[2:34:00] <Papa_Bearman> You can't freeze a ghost!
[2:34:02] <pookam> boooooo
[2:34:02] <sirmcslushers> Maybe the ghosts are immune
[2:34:16] <%Asuterisuku> He has an item!
[2:34:18] <%MontresorMeal> Already suffused with the CHILL OF THE GRAVE
[2:34:18] <exnuart> swirl is an itam
[2:34:18] <Jalexster> Nah, he'd have an icon above him if he was frozen
[2:34:19] <hassanico2> Ghosts are already cold
[2:34:22] <morat2255> Undead don't roll fort saves
[2:34:25] <+desfore> THats a Dizzy Dial
[2:34:26] <BigDaddyofCincinnati> i think its a random chance to freeze not guaranteed
[2:34:31] <bbblaketwitching> I think they have a high resistance for freeze
[2:34:41] <Jalexster> Status effects are the little dialogue bubbles above characters and enemies
[2:34:42] <+desfore> the Swirl is a Dizzy DIal item
[2:34:44] <+BurningLlama777> My parents watched Unsolved Mysteries after I went to bed at night and the theme tune gave me traumatic nightmares
[2:34:46] <+BurningLlama777> RIGHT
[2:34:48] <+AJiiij> so do you need 2 yoshi's still
[2:34:53] <+BurningLlama777> The song is not good ;_;
[2:34:54] <sirmcslushers> Look at her charge tits
[2:34:54] <al0nem0nster> apparently no, just one.
[2:34:57] <Prevot> I dont think that ice attack is worth it unless against fire enemies
[2:34:57] <bbblaketwitching> well not much
[2:35:02] <+AJiiij> wow

[2:35:52] <%lewdskeletor13> woolieFABRICATION woolieFABRICATION woolieFABRICATION woolieFABRICATION
[2:35:52] <%BestTeaMaker> @WoolieVersus if you time the hammer when it hits the star immediately, you execute the freeze attack. There's basically a perfect timing and a good timing.
[2:35:54] <pookam> hmmmm
[2:35:54] <+BurningLlama777> Robert Stack is incredible and I hate him for giving me nightmares
[2:35:54] <%chosenjuan42> or koops
[2:35:56] <damienlunas> Koops would also have worked I think
[2:35:56] <%CursedNobleman> hmm, i dont remember that stained glass
[2:35:57] <%Doplghost> I love stained glass
[2:35:57] <%BisoromiBear> nice hops

[2:36:12] <Jalexster> I'm gonna be honest, I was expecting you to fuck that flutter jump up LUL
[2:36:15] <Papa_Bearman> Woolie has an affinity for VIOLENCE.

[2:36:25] <grimshuck> @hassanico2 yup
[2:36:26] <%BestTeaMaker> basically, the freeze hammer only works if you're really good at the action command and can time it perfectly
[2:36:26] <%Asuterisuku> But I love you the most.

[2:38:01] <+Euphbugg> 2 dmg, nto that good
[2:38:03] <%NopeBadguy> If they're not in contact with the ground, they're airborne, even if they're ground level @WoolieVersus
[2:38:03] <atomicxdj> Violence
[2:38:04] <+Lazyjoules> weak sauce
[2:38:04] <Nyerp> unequip that
[2:38:05] <2017y> is woolie at the 25% mark or the 75% mark of the chapter
[2:38:05] <Papa_Bearman> VIOLENCE
[2:38:05] <Curtis_64> ok so good for lots of flying enemies
[2:38:06] <2017y> did i miss it

[2:38:12] <+zooeymainbtw> get that shiz off
[2:38:14] <twieetcha> That‚Äôs kinda weak
[2:38:14] <%MontresorMeal> it is a mystery
[2:38:17] <citerel> its too little damage for 2 bp
[2:38:18] <+Wilabeen1997> VIOLENCE
[2:38:18] <%RedoctoberWolf> the style is awesome
[2:38:19] <pory_z> 25%
[2:38:26] <GodlyLuigi> the initial hit also deals 5 tho
[2:38:28] <Papa_Bearman> Not worth it, yeah.
[2:38:31] <+desfore> I've never seen that attack before.....
[2:38:33] <+AJiiij> get the stylish first and then take it off
[2:38:35] <chromdad> Well dang
[2:38:36] <%ividboy> most of the time multibounce is better
[2:38:36] <%chosenjuan42> only good if you stack a lot
[2:38:43] <Papa_Bearman> Take off the W Emblem!!

[2:39:28] <%Solidnick18> flower saver?
[2:39:28] <JeoDood> for saver
[2:39:29] <morat2255> buffs are better than options imo, but I know that's not your playstyle.
[2:39:29] <roguemephilesclone> Assuming I wasn't tricked by One Guy, last call on W Emblem.
[2:39:30] <hectic_harlequin> Charge?
[2:39:33] <bbblaketwitching> flower saver is life to be fair
[2:39:33] <Potatoidea> Tornado Jump always felt a little redundant with Multibounce also existing, imo
[2:39:34] <Mrbda241> So the Manga is this far in
[2:39:37] <%Asuterisuku> First Attack is like in Earthbound.

It is the only MMO where you can knock an enemy through a pillar then pick up a piece of that pillar and club him with it. Also it has summon swords the class and another class that plays like a better version of DMC4 Lady.

[3:48:37] <noe_juan_kanobe> Theh were Xnauts
[3:48:37] <+AJiiij> I forget if fire stacks
[3:48:45] <MayorRev> i believe its after she warps back to her original spot @WoolieVersus
[3:48:46] <morat2255> One of those will die on their own
[3:48:50] <%kingkeldeo31> after she goes back near mario
[3:48:51] <%sunnythedrunk> She's kinda the best
[3:48:52] <DatAsuna> he is already dead
[3:48:56] <+AsinPersuasion> wat
[3:48:57] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[3:49:04] <DeepSearch27> Most of them are X-nauts anyway
[3:49:04] <+TheDyingPride> I think the stylish on that one was after she reappears next to mario
[3:49:06] <+Ancopro> you can't hammer backrow
[3:49:06] <+AsinPersuasion> oh yeah
[3:49:07] <%baronblank> woolie why didn;t you attack with vivian first
[3:49:09] <hassanico2> He means Punch into Hammer
[3:49:14] <thetntm> hammer throw
[3:49:15] <elbyboxus> lethal was swap viv to punch then hammer
[3:49:19] <sirmcslushers> I 'THINK' Vivian can attack anyone, not just front row?
[3:49:22] <shiny_prinny> chat wrong
[3:49:24] <hassanico2> BLAH
[3:49:25] <damienlunas> Could have done it by killing the first one with Viv and second with Mario but it's cool
[3:49:27] <@akuda_bar> she can attack anywhere yes
[3:49:28] <MayorRev> OH JEEZ
[3:49:28] <+AngelYoumou> @WoolieVersus FYI, Vivian can stretch to punch aerial enemies too.
[3:49:38] <+AJiiij> vivian can attack anyone, I think
[3:49:45] <roguemephilesclone> And here's the great part: Vivian can attack almost anything, anywhere. Only front spikes stop her.
[3:49:48] <%MontresorMeal> Mistakes are also a part of LPs.
[3:49:51] <+AsinPersuasion> shadow waifu
[3:50:03] <%MontresorMeal> I've come to accept that since getting my ass blown out.

[3:50:24] <%kingkeldeo31> Then you level her up and get an AOE
[3:50:25] <+Huttersson> I think she can attack flying or hanging enemies too.
[3:50:26] <MayorRev> gotcha you flower fuck
[3:50:29] <DeepSearch27> Are the fights worth it right now?
[3:50:34] <DatAsuna> Viv is lowkey maybe the strongest party member once you get her second upgrade

[4:02:40] <al0nem0nster> may need it for the buff, due to not having your options.
[4:02:40] <%Chatterbox1991> yes
[4:02:41] <+zooeymainbtw> tru

[4:03:07] <+agumon9000> You can get more BP later

[4:03:07] <HiddenDM> THinking ahead
[4:03:08] <Papa_Bearman> If I unequipped Quick Change, I'd forget to re-equip it anyway.
[4:03:08] <+AnthraxJohnson> SUBOPTIMAL
[4:03:09] <autcetera> He's going to have to do this at some point anyway
[4:03:09] <%kingkeldeo31> Permant builds are dumb, just change things up every now and then
[4:03:13] <+zooeymainbtw> fire and happy can go
[4:03:13] <+Euphbugg> if you gonna do it might as well do it now then have to do it again later

[4:03:23] <%Th3SmartAlec> We're going to have that discussion anyway
[4:03:25] <Shwepie> If you could save multiple badge loadouts I could see removing Quick Change, otherwise nah too lazy.
[4:03:27] <DeepSearch27> Woolie could take off quick change, and then he'll probably gain a level and build BP
[4:03:31] <%marshalmorphino2> Or at least one guy will
[4:03:32] <+AJiiij> yeah just figure it out, woolies right
[4:03:33] <MyNameIsRasus> ? You already have enough

[0:04:48] <%GeneralSCPatton> GeneralSCPatton subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! The final rip approaches. Also, sorry for the misunderstanding in the podcast. Pat had a "It was Pat" moment, so I referenced "It was me, Austin". I guess I'm canon to the podcast now.

[0:04:51] <%Josef_Stryker> for Doom I mean
[0:04:52] <%Atomik456> yeah i feel like given what wooolie said, 2d fps is probably a no go. maybe something like DUSK?

[0:14:27] <$Chatterbox1991> MrDestructoid500 as a gay man who supports #BLM, i think it should be said that people tend to over-generalize people wanting games to be Apolitical; the reason i tend to be nervous about politics in games is from having seen countless games try to be political and do so poorly; ether duo to it being so hamfisted to the point of cringe (Detroit) or to cheaply pander without conviction for marketing purposes (EA & Activision), I might not be the majority but i think it should be acknowledged.

[0:23:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> Mel likes mechanics
[0:23:52] <$legacy0117> Mel here.
[0:23:59] <mdkcde> Mechanics
[0:23:59] <%Shishi1205> Mechanics @WoolieVersus
[0:24:00] <VidulaSaix> I'm definitely a Mel then
[0:24:02] <%GeneralSCPatton> Vorthos likes lore
[0:24:02] <%Double_Tap_That> You're looking at one, Reg
[0:24:09] <+jiggy_snipe> lol the Reggie
[0:24:09] <$legacy0117> LORE
[0:24:12] <+tearfuldevil> i'm timmy/mel/vorthos
[0:24:15] <fuji_92> mel is card design and interactions, and volthos is lore
[0:24:21] <pennykettle_> Vorthos gang
[0:24:22] <%Neoepochx> If you play an eternal format you can get away with playing with same deck for ever. at least until 2019 happened.
[0:24:23] <+jiggy_snipe> the Woolie KappaHD
[0:24:27] <Ozmodyas> Melvin is about pure mechanics vs Vorthos pure lore/flavor
[0:24:27] <+ItsCaptainDisco> What are we talking about?
[0:24:44] <+ggbhtg> Vorthos was Lorethos, right?
[0:24:45] <%klholland92> Hey woolz any chance we could see more space opera rpg goodness when you‚Äôre done with KOTOR with a mass effect LP?
[0:24:49] <$legacy0117> Vorthus then. Sorry.
[0:24:50] <%Shishi1205> correct
[0:24:52] <lotharrio> Yeah! Vorthus!
[0:24:53] <mdkcde> That's Flavor
[0:24:56] <pennykettle_> Vorthos loves flavor.
[0:25:04] <fuji_92> volthos is woolthos
[0:25:10] <+tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus the original article on wotc website only has Timmy, Johnny, and Spike, Mel and Vorthos were added by someone
[0:25:11] <jerichotrump> Yugioh?
[0:25:13] <%emperordread> How does Dark Magician Girl fit into the Yu-Gi-Oh lore?
[0:25:16] <mdkcde> When the card lore reflect the mecanic it is called "Good Flavor"
[0:25:17] <fuji_92> *vorthos
[0:25:17] <+jiggy_snipe> we're talking about the Magic the Gathering player archetypes
[0:25:18] <%GeneralSCPatton> Vorthos likes what the mechanics imply in lore. The favor. Mel is about functions.
[0:25:20] <lotharrio> System design was one of them.
[0:25:21] <Ozmodyas> Vorthos is about lore implementation, Melvin is only concerned with function vs function
[0:25:21] <+Superbro64> I suggest reading the -actual- magic the gathering article on these archetypes woolie
[0:25:25] <Shwepie> Mel is just, "This art is awesome, into the deck to goes!"
[0:25:29] <%R3Roundabout> Not anesthetics, mechanics
[0:25:32] <+Superbro64> the email is dieting it down for you

[0:25:47] <+ggbhtg> @emperordread She's usually considered DM's apprentice
[0:25:50] <%Shishi1205> Mel likes the card that go BRRR

[0:27:05] <+tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersuswoolie, reggie, this stuff comes from a 20008ish article on the MTG website, but the article only has Timmy, Johnny, and Spike (as well as mixtures of them, Timmy/Johnny, Johnny/spike, Timmy/Spike, and Timmy/Johnny/Spike), Mel and Vorthos were added by someone and i've never heard about them before, and i've known about this article for years
[0:27:10] <pennykettle_> I think my favourite card gimmick is when you have cards that the enemy should be afraid of killing. When you kill my monsters, it benefits me.

[0:28:44] <DelgotHansto> This virus is so widespread even the Sun has a Corona smh
[0:28:46] <%emperordread> Detroit had NO MESSAGE
[0:28:51] <+jiggy_snipe> Detroit wasn't political tho
[0:28:56] <fuji_92> yeah, but no
[0:28:57] <jevichrono> Detroit Beyond Two Holes was not about anything
[0:28:58] <Chatterbox1991> im totally fine with games being political i just want it to be well done so it has actual meaning behind it. (think Spec Ops The Line)
[0:29:01] <%Shishi1205> For Reggie: Mel is the "mechanic player", someone focused on the craft of Design & Development. A Mel is characterized for appreciating cards with delicate and interesting interactions, as well as strong mechanics
[0:29:01] <%Josef_Stryker> Detroit just wanted to ask questions tho
[0:29:02] <gunsrlove> What did Chatter say again LUL
[0:29:02] <%dekkitout> Detroit was only asking questions
[0:29:03] <%spacehouse> Deus Ex is the best
[0:29:06] <@Solidus_113> chatter pls
[0:29:08] <+tearfuldevil> politics being badwritten in videogames = / = people complaining about any remotely leftist content in videogames
[0:29:09] <+ItsCaptainDisco> Remember "We Have A Dream" was not political
[0:29:11] <%DesertPenguin> Socio-political is the correct term
[0:29:16] <+kewlmyc> THANK YOU
[0:29:17] <%DesertPenguin> Socio is the important party
[0:29:20] <derap41> Its not a political issue its a moral one
[0:29:22] <@Commando_Joe> They want EQUALITY. How much lower can your demands be? @WoolieVersus
[0:29:23] <+tearfuldevil> human rights ARE POLITICAL
[0:29:23] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:29:29] <pillowwasp> People never complained about Bioshock. People just don‚Äôt like race stuff because they are weak
[0:29:31] <+tearfuldevil> thats what politics are woolie
[0:29:33] <%Mrbaconator> those are political tho
[0:29:33] <%DesertPenguin> Geo-cultural might apply as well
[0:29:33] <akman14> But woolie, what if i want to kill all humans?
[0:29:44] <derap41> Look at Terry Crews Twitter Poor guy
[0:29:51] <+vaporousTippler> They shouldn't be political. But sadly, they are.
[0:30:02] <VidulaSaix> terry got attacked over some crazy dumb shit. People latch onto 1 word and ignore everything else
[0:30:07] <+kewlmyc> "We don't want to keep getting killed unjustly by cops." What a political stance... sbfpBleetz
[0:30:09] <%dekkitout> I see that you don't like a burning house, but please don't call the burning house next door a mere "inconvience"
[0:30:09] <%gatorafan> Is Woolie on the list yet? Kappa
[0:30:17] <wrightlight94> Poor Terry crews doyCry
[0:30:19] <%seduwu> Woolie is on the list
[0:30:20] <+tearfuldevil> @vaporousTippler ????? do you think that politicians shouldn't be campaigning based aorund improving human rights?
[0:30:25] <+ggbhtg> *sighs*, Mike Z.....of all the times.....I guess Skullgirls will never be a real girl
[0:30:27] <jevichrono> Woolie is on the List
[0:30:28] <%DesertPenguin> Something can be political and also not "get" political?
[0:30:30] <%gatorafan> waow
[0:30:35] <derap41> Whatabout ?
[0:30:37] <@Commando_Joe> "Guys what about black on black crime?" <- a thing I read today
[0:30:38] <+vaporousTippler> I think it's stupid they have to, @tearfuldevil it should be a given.
[0:30:47] <%seduwu> goddamn it Mike Z
[0:30:49] <fuji_92> fucking whataboutism
[0:31:01] <DaKnightWarrior> Mike Z is not racist he's just dumb.
[0:31:03] <pennykettle_> I think human rights are very political, maybe the distinction should be that human rights shouldn't be partisan. All sides of the political spectrum should agree that black lives matter
[0:31:05] <Arth__> woolie describing the gop/conservative media/the wh?
[0:31:06] <%Shishi1205> You can see the trash that seeps from behind some of those comments
[0:31:10] <+ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus That's the Republican way, sadly. Deflect and downplay.
[0:31:11] <VidulaSaix> Mike "Not Enough Time Passed" Z LUL
[0:31:12] <Dova573> Exactly at least be honest why you dont like people saying that people shouldnt get kill by cops
[0:31:12] <PlasticJake> humans are fucking dumb
[0:31:13] <+tearfuldevil> @vaporousTippler thats fair i guess but they aren't and won't be until we change things, and doing so is political
[0:31:14] <%lewdskeletor13> All my homies hate whataboutism
[0:31:28] <+vaporousTippler> If a political party declares the sky to be blue, the other party will find a way to argue about it.
[0:31:36] <fuji_92> "this crime is bad yes, but what about this crime" SoonerLater why ppl do this shit
[0:31:38] <%DesertPenguin> Someone said it really well. "Be grateful we're out for equality and not revenge." That shook me to my core
[0:31:47] <LeeOhX> wtf Woolie, that makes too much sense knock that shit off they dont wanna hear it
[0:31:50] <+jiggy_snipe> Mike Z just made a poor joke. I will now call him Mike Gottfried or Gilbert Z
[0:31:57] <Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus i totally agree
[0:31:58] <megamonmon123> was this whataboutism or was they just bring it up?

[0:32:12] <+ItsCaptainDisco> Can't wait for people to get upset about Cyberpunk 2077 - from a genre that satirises hypercapitalism & in a game written by someone who's not white
[0:32:24] <+kewlmyc> Human rights versus Cringe in Videogames: One is way more important than the other

[0:32:31] <koolaid_kevster> Was George Floyd death from racism. Or abuse of power? @woolieversus I need to know
[0:32:33] <%DesertPenguin> @WoolieVersus Someone said it really well. "Be grateful we're out for equality and not revenge." That shook me to my core
[0:32:40] <VidulaSaix> @koolaid_kevster Both
[0:32:42] <DaKnightWarrior> both
[0:32:42] <%emperordread> There can be value in a Devil's Advocate. But when it comes to BLM and police brutality - it's SUPER not the time in the light of all the heinous injustice
[0:32:45] <pennykettle_> I'd rather have cringe in videogames if it means black people get human rights lol
[0:32:47] <%dekkitout> @koolaid_kevster Yes
[0:32:48] <pillowwasp> People treat political parties like sports teams
[0:32:49] <+tearfuldevil> @ItsCaptainDisco is CDProjekt working much with Mike Pondsmith?
[0:32:52] <+vaporousTippler> Racism in itself is an abuse of power.
[0:32:52] <Chatterbox1991> i totally understand, thank you.

[0:35:54] <JoeStillLife> "anything is possible, nothing is guaranteed"
[0:35:55] <PlasticJake> man it's so weird they made two good Mass Effect Games and then stopped. how strange
[0:35:56] <%Asuterisuku> Little V's stuff is pretty rad.
[0:36:00] <%lewdskeletor13> Fallen Order would be a decent shortish game
[0:36:01] <+snugglepuggs> promises nothing will deliver less
[0:36:01] <Darren716> Yeah but music is stupid
[0:36:02] <+jiggy_snipe> naw just be blind
[0:36:10] <raikagelord1> So who actually like the recent progressive race/gender swap of marvel comics the last couple of years???
[0:36:16] <%seduwu> music isn‚Äôt real
[0:36:19] <%Ashenik1> Has anybody seen how Ben Shapiro bitched out a interview from a british interview becasue he asked questions ? LUL
[0:36:20] <$legacy0117> Mass Effect games series last ending is pretty shite tho.
[0:36:20] <raikagelord1> Just curious
[0:36:20] <ralphfromdk> Then let's do a Bloodpool, but turn it into the Little V tip jar :o
[0:36:27] <%emperordread> I randomly came across one of lil v's videos on YT. I was like "Hey, it's the Star Wars guy!"
[0:36:27] <%DesertPenguin> With Pat doing a DS3 Cinders LP, it would be cool to see Woolie go through DS3 Vanilla all by himself without Pat's help
[0:36:27] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:36:30] <PlasticJake> fallen order would be sick

[0:36:42] <%seduwu> Tip jar
[0:36:49] <derap41> Given how the hole Ai revolution was driven by a company I'd say that's pretty fucking bad for representation
[0:36:50] <VidulaSaix> Fallen Order is okay but I don't think it's a good LP game
[0:36:58] <megamonmon123> @fuqboislim which one?
[0:37:03] <akman14> Mother's Basement LUL more like crunchyroll's basement
[0:37:05] <%Shishi1205> Kara was the girl right?

[1:06:08] <%HitchhikingThrough> aww yeah just in time for heaven
[1:06:09] <%Asuterisuku> ... Wow I messed up typing that.
[1:06:15] <pennykettle_> Archville, USA is a Beach Boys song i think
[1:06:15] <%a_goth_pancake> Arch Ville was my favorite Facebook clicker game.
[1:06:16] <%arcielardor> welcome to Archville
[1:06:18] <ghostspartan80> hipster archvile should be in the campaign
[1:06:19] <$legacy0117> Be wary if as another pops up!
[1:06:23] <LeeOhX> did woolie get the glory kill from the back on those spider demons? cause is hilarious
[1:06:27] <+zetastriker> Mmmm, blood punching the teleporting imps feels so good. Usually staggers into glory, into a new blood punch.
[1:06:37] <%Asuterisuku> It could also be a Revenant, but yeah, that's the Hunter there.
[1:06:39] <%HitchhikingThrough> and god damn is woolie hitting headshots on the drones consistantly? pogChamp

[1:07:02] <+Mkingston> Archville's scared the shit out of me when I first saw them. I grew up on the PS1 version of Doom so when I played it on PC they were a shock.
[1:07:04] <%Javaa01> These drones keep you FED if you hit your shots
[1:07:07] <+UltraKrysis> Is this Hurt Me Plenty?
[1:07:10] <%Asuterisuku> Drones are technically Fodder, but they take three pips to Chainsaw.
[1:07:13] <%Asuterisuku> This is HMP, yes.
[1:07:14] <ghostspartan80> you'll be ready for ultra nightmare in no time
[1:07:17] <%Javaa01> Staying at max health is not an issue in Urdak
[1:07:19] <cocobody> Woolie is SO much agile than I was with the Super Shotgun. I'm jealous
[1:07:20] <venomfury86> it's sad that you can't use the enemy skins in the campaign
[1:07:37] <mark_collins45> Look at these pro strats. You're the fucking boss now Woolie.
[1:07:38] <pennykettle_> venomfury86 IKR? it feels so pointless otherwise.
[1:07:39] <%Asuterisuku> I don't think the player skins for demons have damage models though.

[1:11:18] <%a_goth_pancake> if Romero is the devil, does that make Carmack God?
[1:11:29] <Nested_Dreams> Right, it's a feet-less species
[1:11:30] <venomfury86> mastery cookie
[1:11:31] <arkv01> the khan makyr got those karen vibes
[1:11:31] <%HitchhikingThrough> I'd guess the previous room based on the map
[1:11:32] <%Javaa01> Gotta go backwards further
[1:11:33] <%Neoepochx> The room before this one.
[1:11:34] <ralphfromdk> Nested_Dreams Nope, Sam did that on his own accord because he wants to be in charge and needs her dead, but she's staying alive with argent
[1:11:39] <megamonmon123> its the previous room
[1:11:41] <Saltmeisterr> no romero is the icon of sin
[1:11:45] <$legacy0117> The creators of Doom 2016 and Doom Eternal probably didn't want to have churches to protest the game on their front lawns, so they probably changed it from Satan to the Dark Lord unless it always was that way...and moar LORE.
[1:11:58] <Kragular> activate your stand!
[1:11:58] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:12:04] <%Asuterisuku> Look up.
[1:12:14] <%Neoepochx> Behind the column on the right.
[1:12:16] <Nested_Dreams> @ralphfromdk Did lore ever explain how Sam was able to disobey Maykr?
[1:12:16] <%Javaa01> Yeah, they kinda stop bothering to hide these very well, cause they obviously want you to have ALL the masteries by the next level
[1:12:17] <+tearfuldevil> @legacy0117 you think mfing ID SOFTWARE gives a fuck about protests
[1:12:18] <ghostspartan80> to the side maybe
[1:12:25] <@Solidus_113> YEAH
[1:12:26] <%Josef_Stryker> RIP AND TEAR
[1:12:27] <VidulaSaix> Sneaky little secret
[1:12:28] <Solidnick18> YEAH
[1:12:30] <%Asuterisuku> _RIP and TEAR_
[1:12:30] <Kragular> You put your right hand in....
[1:12:31] <$legacy0117> Probably nottttt
[1:12:36] <venomfury86> RIP AND TEAR
[1:12:37] <%HitchhikingThrough> THAT MEANS YOU HAVE HUGE GUTS
[1:12:48] <%a_goth_pancake> RIP AND TEAR
[1:12:49] <%Asuterisuku> I think that's the one that spawns in the room with the 2016 Praetor suit.
[1:12:50] <arkv01> I mean it's also a lot more fun to just say the bible isn't canon and the real dark lord is something else
[1:12:50] <%HitchhikingThrough> LUL
[1:12:52] <ralphfromdk> Nested_Dreams Nope, but he was her right hand man, so if any one could, it was him.
[1:12:52] <rytisone> they're action figures Kappa
[1:12:54] <LeeOhX> very nice
[1:12:56] <megamonmon123> gg
[1:12:56] <+tearfuldevil> @legacy0117 while it is different people, it is still ID SOFTWARE, the company that made the original doom
[1:12:59] <FeelinNifty> wip and teaw
[1:13:10] <ghostspartan80> doom guy collects funkos
[1:13:15] <arkv01> *tweah
[1:13:19] <pennykettle_> OwO *nuzzles your super shotgun*
[1:13:21] <$legacy0117> Then there ya go. All that needs to be said.
[1:13:23] <bepno> i wish more games had koopy sandwiches
[1:13:39] <Hanstelgotto> Can't believe that Doom retconned the bible
[1:13:40] <@Solidus_113> SWORD
[1:13:41] <Solidnick18> SourPls
[1:13:43] <venomfury86> Descent from Cerberon best theme
[1:13:48] <%Javaa01> Ehh, it's just a Baron
[1:13:54] <%Javaa01> You can melt his ass no problem
[1:14:00] <rytisone> knock knock open up the door
[1:14:01] <0rond> OH LAWD HE RUNNIN
[1:14:01] <+zetastriker> Barons were the weakest Super Heavy, for sure
[1:14:04] <mark_collins45> Oh lawd!
[1:14:06] <snakest3alth> USE THE CRUCIBLE
[1:14:13] <%Neoepochx> Chaingun for staggerse
[1:14:20] <%a_goth_pancake> chaingun
[1:14:22] <ghostspartan80> chaingun for days
[1:14:24] <arkv01> oh LAWD HE COMIN
[1:14:32] <zyzytheboss> hi
[1:14:33] <Who_lio42> no chaingun SSG ONLY
[1:14:35] <megamonmon123> woolie likes the super shotgun a bit too much
[1:14:38] <%Asuterisuku> That's not the first time they threw a single Baron at you and called it an encounter.
[1:14:41] <ralphfromdk> turret mode on the chaingun was made for that kind of dude
[1:14:42] <%a_goth_pancake> it's hilarious, he literally can't move
[1:14:44] <pennykettle_> Okay this game may be slightly divisive but can we agree that the knife doomguy uses made all the glory kills lazier
[1:14:53] <peachy996> SSG is love SSG is life
[1:14:56] <@Solidus_113> oh, this part
[1:14:57] <Hanstelgotto> The theme of baron glory kills, is neck slitting
[1:14:58] <+YabbaTroll> yeah some of them
[1:15:04] <Who_lio42> not woolz fault SSG is stupid gppd
[1:15:04] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @VidulaSaix
[1:15:05] <%RangeCraft> damn... as a long time anime watcher and a first time manga watcher .... your skill has for sure improved
[1:15:05] <alphalejandro> Red sakuras?
[1:15:05] <%HitchhikingThrough> something about the way demons run into the rooms in this game is fucking hilarious. Every time I see a marauder run in from halfway across the map I lose my shit.
[1:15:06] <Who_lio42> good
[1:15:08] <%Asuterisuku> Aaaah, he said the thing.
[1:15:09] <+LynbellDaYo> THE ICON OF sIN GROWs MORE POWERFULL
[1:15:09] <FeelinNifty> heh heh he said the line!!!!
[1:15:11] <%Asuterisuku> Look down, Woolie.
[1:15:11] <megamonmon123> he said the meme
[1:15:12] <pennykettle_> the icon of sing grows more powerful the longer he is on earth
[1:15:13] <Hanstelgotto> So stronk
[1:15:14] <LeeOhX> More powerful eh
[1:15:19] <%Shishi1205> The icon of sin grows more powerful the longer he is on earth
[1:15:20] <Saltmeisterr> take a sip boys
[1:15:26] <Nested_Dreams> A good part of blade gory kills isn't gorey enough
[1:15:28] <Tha_Mik> sigh
[1:15:30] <%a_goth_pancake> don't want that, do we? Kappa
[1:15:36] <mdkcde> Remember, The Longer the Icon of Sin is on Earth, the stronger it becomes
[1:15:40] <+dmtjinni> i swear these streams bring me comfort
[1:15:44] <$legacy0117> Unless the creators shifted the tone on purpose, but if ID was guiding it then they probably had a plan for a long time. From DOOM 64 to DOOM 2016, is a long ass time but yeah.
[1:15:58] <Nested_Dreams> I want to see the baron's head dangling after that slash
[1:16:16] <%Asuterisuku> You won't have enough Weapon points to finish everything until about half way through the final level.
[1:16:17] <pennykettle_> I dont use remote detonate but the attachement looks so much cooler. why does a rocket launcher need a chain
[1:16:20] <ghostspartan80> the next doom will obviously be a visual novel
[1:16:33] <arkv01> @ghostspartan80 it will be now
[1:16:38] <Tha_Mik> Next doom is gonna be a mobile rpg, oh wait
[1:16:39] <+maenos2> rip and tear senpai
[1:16:44] <%a_goth_pancake> I'm down, give me my demon dating sim
[1:16:50] <mark_collins45> Remote detonation is neat but I never used it.
[1:16:50] <Who_lio42> it was prob better to avoid the headache w media and just use DARK LORD instead of a set name like satan
[1:16:50] <insaneintentionsyo> yo
[1:16:55] <+LynbellDaYo> DOOM gacha
[1:16:58] <%Asuterisuku> Microwave beam is kind of useless unpatched.
[1:17:01] <anita_dickin> You don't like symetra?
[1:17:05] <%Javaa01> Explosive Array is surprisingly good for taking out weak spots in groups, and generally just getting rid of imps
[1:17:05] <%HitchhikingThrough> @a_goth_pancake play Helltaker
[1:17:12] <Solidnick18> WOO
[1:17:13] <Saltmeisterr> probs same reason why god is called the father
[1:17:18] <@Solidus_113> nyooooom
[1:17:18] <ralphfromdk> Tha_Mik With Bethesda in charge, it might just fucking be one :l
[1:17:18] <ghostspartan80> HDoom will somehow be a part of the canon
[1:17:34] <pennykettle_> isnt HDoom already canon
[1:17:37] <Who_lio42> I only liked Lock on for bosses, otherwise remote det was super good imo
[1:17:48] <%a_goth_pancake> almost had some speed running tech going on there
[1:17:59] <@Solidus_113> THE BOY
[1:18:00] <alphalejandro> Vergil!

[1:18:10] <%Asuterisuku> Oh no he shot the shield.
[1:18:12] <VidulaSaix> It's the MAD LAD
[1:18:14] <Nested_Dreams> Remote detonation is a viable marauder opener
[1:18:17] <Hanstelgotto> FOOLISHNESS
[1:18:17] <pennykettle_> how it feels to chew 5 gum

[1:19:11] <ghostspartan80> man a sword fight with the marauder would be sick
[1:19:11] <+zetastriker> After a while I just started doing super shotgun into BFG to instant gib them.
[1:19:12] <%a_goth_pancake> of course woolie gets all nervous when his crush shows up
[1:19:14] <%fist_wizard_jay> Woolie what the fuck
[1:19:14] <%arcielardor> Woolie came for Doom but decided to play KOTOR
[1:19:14] <%rosemon5001> i wonder if you get the marauder in a glory kill situation could you chainsaw him?
[1:19:15] <Who_lio42> I like the Ice nade tech WAY better for them now
[1:19:20] <ralphfromdk> aaaaand lore
[1:19:21] <Saltmeisterr> BIG LORE COMING
[1:19:28] <megamonmon123> regular shotgun still.useful
[1:19:30] <pennykettle_> I dont think woolie has used the sticky grenades since the challenge. I love those little guys :(
[1:19:33] <%Shishi1205> he is inmune
[1:19:35] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WILL WE?
[1:19:37] <megamonmon123> nope
[1:19:39] <%Javaa01> Nope, you can't sword the Marauder
[1:19:42] <%Javaa01> He has a shield
[1:19:45] <%Javaa01> He will use it
[1:19:49] <LeeOhX> *sweats in massive Lore*
[1:19:51] <unit24> you technically can if you can stagger him for long enough
[1:19:59] <%fist_wizard_jay> We wuz Slayers n shiet
[1:19:59] <Who_lio42> sticky bombs were my baby, I was made when my game bugged and took them away from me
[1:20:03] <+LynbellDaYo> i think you can monkey bar up there or something
[1:20:05] <unit24> it's just tough and not really worth it
[1:20:06] <VidulaSaix> YES REGGIE
[1:20:09] <VidulaSaix> I LOVE THAT SONG LUL
[1:20:10] <ghostspartan80> I think you can glitch it fast enough to crucible him maybe
[1:20:15] <%Neoepochx> You can make that.
[1:20:16] <Hanstelgotto> Man the cool Maruader glory kill made me jump out my seat, too bad no one ever gets it
[1:20:20] <lotharrio> Don't you sing those devil songs, Reggie!
[1:20:20] <%Javaa01> It's totally doable
[1:20:20] <DFireCreations> swing

[1:32:31] <%a_goth_pancake> just wait woolz

[1:32:35] <ghostspartan80> oh boi you'll see those makyrs up close for sure
[1:32:35] <%Shishi1205> there's a cool dude near that extra life
[1:32:56] <Raldavar> Nothing beats old biblical descriptions of angels
[1:32:59] <$legacy0117> Wait, that's what they remind of. Those ugly arse Angels from Batonetta
[1:33:03] <%Asuterisuku> Left or right, Woolie?

[1:33:17] <$legacy0117> me*
[1:33:18] <mark_collins45> THIS MUSIC!
[1:33:21] <%DesertPenguin> What's your favorite classic video game "thing" from this game? The Mario fire wheels? The literal 1-Ups?
[1:33:22] <%Javaa01> Gotta take a jump pad
[1:33:23] <%Klefth> Man, this is one Warframe ass Warframe level if I've ever seen one
[1:33:28] <%a_goth_pancake> left first, it's a shorter path
[1:33:35] <%Asuterisuku> Mick's ambience is really getting pushed here.
[1:33:43] <ghostspartan80> some Urdak tracks remind me of Blade Runner 2049
[1:33:43] <%DesertPenguin> This was tough without aerial mobility LUL
[1:33:44] <pennykettle_> the longer the icon of sin is on earth
[1:33:45] <%lewdskeletor13> I loved the platforming and how unapologetically weird it was
[1:33:48] <%gatorafan> @klefth Khan Maykr can't Vorpost
[1:33:49] <%Asuterisuku> Last secret mission nearby.
[1:33:51] <DatAsuna> we knew that sam
[1:33:54] <VidulaSaix> "Fuck Heaven" Reggie 2020
[1:34:00] <+YabbaTroll> isnt it samur's ?
[1:34:01] <+LynbellDaYo> it's sam's
[1:34:02] <pennykettle_> is it? she had no choice
[1:34:04] <%BallerSwagBro9k> and Sams
[1:34:04] <spidervenomized> it was sam
[1:34:05] <VidulaSaix> It's Sams lol
[1:34:05] <%lewdskeletor13> Fuck them angels
[1:34:06] <peachy996> It's...kinda his
[1:34:07] <Raldavar> Wheel with 3 heads, wings out of every corner, tentacles, and the whole thing is on fire
[1:34:13] <%FuqBoiSlim> "Fuck them angels" - Michael Jordan
[1:34:17] <spidervenomized> sam took god from them
[1:34:25] <%Shishi1205> he is "trapped" in your ship now anyway
[1:34:28] <venomfury86> it happened after Samur stole The Father
[1:34:29] <TheHardM> It's the Seraphim's fault. He took the father and made the Maykers vulnerable to Transfiguration.
[1:34:29] <%Javaa01> Yeah, this is Samuel's fuckup we're cleaning up
[1:34:29] <gunsrlove> Did Sam taking the Father cause the Transfiguration tho, i forget if that was mentioned in the lore
[1:34:31] <%a_goth_pancake> challengee behind
[1:34:32] <%lewdskeletor13> Well she did that after the Father was stolen
[1:34:33] <%Asuterisuku> Look back, Woolie, Secret Mission!
[1:34:34] <mark_collins45> Sam Hayden, S Hayden, Satan
[1:34:36] <%DesertPenguin> Why does it take so long to get 2 Blood Punch charges?
[1:34:39] <megamonmon123> this is mission 12 correct?
[1:34:43] <%a_goth_pancake> outside to the left
[1:34:44] <pennykettle_> I hate that 2016's hell skull switches are now just in every dimension in Eternal
[1:34:45] <ghostspartan80> Samur literally stole God
[1:34:46] <Who_lio42> im glad SKULL SWITCH (tm) tech is universal
[1:34:49] <+YabbaTroll> she needs the argent to not die, and she dont wanna die cause samur took her rebirth shit right?
[1:34:54] <@Solidus_113> slayer gates are done
[1:34:54] <peachy996> Sam took god away before the Kahn Maykr exiled him for giving Doomguy the powerup
[1:34:55] <Solidnick18> yeah just gore nests
[1:34:57] <%gatorafan> Sam continues to poopoo fart all over the universe
[1:35:03] <%Asuterisuku> You might wanna BFG this one.
[1:35:03] <%lewdskeletor13> There‚Äôs also a demon who was formerly an angel named Samael
[1:35:04] <mark_collins45> this one sucked
[1:35:08] <+akikyou> Sam with the YOINK
[1:35:08] <%a_goth_pancake> good luck woolz sbfpLiam
[1:35:11] <%rosemon5001> is the pool room soon?
[1:35:19] <ghostspartan80> Sam with the 4d chess plays
[1:35:20] <megamonmon123> gg
[1:35:20] <VidulaSaix> Nice
[1:35:21] <%Shishi1205> GG
[1:35:22] <@Solidus_113> THE SHIELD
[1:35:22] <%Asuterisuku> Handled.
[1:35:22] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> gg
[1:35:23] <+YabbaTroll> yoooo that shield
[1:35:23] <Tha_Mik> ez
[1:35:23] <%SuperKirby24> nice
[1:35:26] <mark_collins45> EZ
[1:35:30] <%lewdskeletor13> Clap
[1:35:33] <%FuqBoiSlim> bodied
[1:35:34] <+LynbellDaYo> transfiguration is just a natural thing to them, with the father gone though, the next khan maykr can't be made
[1:35:34] <Make_me_mad> Sam took the father, which messed up the Maykr's reincarnation thing, which meant they turned into weird ass demons as time went on unless they fueled themselves with Argent energy. So basically Sam caused all of this.
[1:35:36] <%a_goth_pancake> fucking nice
[1:35:43] <ghostspartan80> you can shoot shield at guya
[1:35:45] <%DesertPenguin> Shield is great
[1:35:46] <Nested_Dreams> PogChamp
[1:35:49] <%Neoepochx> The shield launch is pretty good
[1:35:51] <%GeneralSCPatton> Shield is great
[1:35:58] <%lewdskeletor13> Shield was infiltrated by hydra
[1:36:00] <venomfury86> i'm surprised the final challenge didn't include the Marauder
[1:36:01] <@Solidus_113> there's a circle that fills around the reticle
[1:36:02] <%DesertPenguin> Shield is great. Shield.
[1:36:04] <rytisone> embrace overwatch
[1:36:04] <%a_goth_pancake> this fight sucks on UV. doom hunters in small rooms is no bueno
[1:36:05] <$jaxondorf> that Gattling gun is a PROBLEM SOLVER
[1:36:06] <Zebroneath> Shield launch guarantees a flinch
[1:36:08] <ghostspartan80> shield bash
[1:36:21] <$legacy0117> Chaingun cleans up the mid-bosses pretty dang well.
[1:36:28] <%Javaa01> You should be sitting on shield at this point, the shield launch makes up for the loss of DPS compared to Turret Mode, without the absurd ammo waste
[1:36:31] <pennykettle_> The timeline is confusing me, did Sam fuck them over before or after the Maykrs fucked with the Sentinels
[1:36:42] <mark_collins45> I'm under the impression that Doomguy still thinks that Sam is human and that's why he hasn't killed him yet.
[1:36:47] <%Asuterisuku> Incoming fuck room.
[1:36:52] <dinnydanny777> Are we at Demonic style yet
[1:36:52] <%Javaa01> Because Turret Mode is built to waste all your ammo
[1:36:54] <Hal10k> The ability to freely trade hits in this game shouldn't be underestimated
[1:36:56] <ghostspartan80> fuck this room
[1:37:06] <%lewdskeletor13> @pennykettle_ Sam stole the Father which in turn forced them to turn to Argent energy to solve their problems
[1:37:07] <%Javaa01> Yeah, this room is a problem
[1:37:08] <%a_goth_pancake> m i s s
[1:37:16] <Solidnick18> nice
[1:37:16] <+YabbaTroll> QUICKSCOPE
[1:37:20] <%DesertPenguin> 360
[1:37:21] <ghostspartan80> two big boys AND a snek
[1:37:26] <Solidnick18> yeah from the headshot
[1:37:26] <%Klefth> Actual quickscope
[1:37:31] <%a_goth_pancake> buncha sneks
[1:37:33] <TheHardM> Oof.
[1:37:33] <dinnydanny777> Wow this room looks rough
[1:37:35] <Solidnick18> Oof
[1:37:36] <@Solidus_113> monkaS
[1:37:37] <%DesertPenguin> You got too close to the Mancubus. They have a really annoying AOE
[1:37:40] <ghostspartan80> BFG
[1:37:41] <%Asuterisuku> Never stop moving.
[1:37:48] <Make_me_mad> Okay I think this is the room I was thinking of earlier, that felt like the hardest thing in the game.
[1:37:53] <%lewdskeletor13> This area took me a bit
[1:38:00] <peachy996> This is the room that eats you if you get cornered
[1:38:02] <%alpacasintophats> full health and full ammo from head shots on those maykr
[1:38:03] <%a_goth_pancake> ABCDA; Always Be Clapping Demon Ass
[1:38:05] <$legacy0117> After, before he was a "Seraphim" which in Biblical lore is the closest rank to Arch-Angels
[1:38:16] <Raldavar> Turret mode triples your dps without lowering damage per bullet. There is no waste
[1:38:16] <+LynbellDaYo> samur gave doomguy the fuck off powers during a hell invasion, so i'm thinking he didn't steal the father until then
[1:38:18] <%DesertPenguin> @WoolieVersus, you can make the HUD bigger. That will help a lot
[1:38:27] <+zetastriker> Woolie really is way better with his movement here than where the the anime is.
[1:38:30] <%Asuterisuku> Huh. Makyr Drones count as flying? I didn't know that.
[1:38:34] <peachy996> Samur timeline isn't 100% clear
[1:38:49] <%Asuterisuku> His aim's getting better too.
[1:38:49] <%FuqBoiSlim> and tlhey dont STOP coming and they dont stop coming and they dont stop coming
[1:38:50] <Who_lio42> think of the chaingun as a waterhose, good for people on fire
[1:38:50] <venomfury86> i love the sound of the Arbalest before it explodes
[1:38:52] <Solidnick18> Cooombo
[1:38:53] <VidulaSaix> PogChamp
[1:39:00] <%lewdskeletor13> Well he stole the Father when he left, so it had to be after he gave Doomguy the powers
[1:39:00] <@Solidus_113> ANOTHA ONE
[1:39:01] <rytisone> Baron is such a poser
[1:39:02] <metabot64> wat is woolie playing this on
[1:39:05] <%Asuterisuku> Baron number 2
[1:39:08] <%lewdskeletor13> Hmp
[1:39:09] <RunningNGunning> We are now in REAL late game
[1:39:13] <ghostspartan80> I kinda hope sam isn't the angel. would be a bit too ridiculous if it all connected like that
[1:39:13] <%Asuterisuku> @metabot64 PS4.
[1:39:13] <%a_goth_pancake> chaingun that mf
[1:39:13] <VidulaSaix> THIS ROOM doodCrazy
[1:39:18] <%Klefth> Yo Woolie's playing so much better than last time, lol
[1:39:28] <Make_me_mad> Okay, that was not the room.
[1:39:33] <gunsrlove> Yeet
[1:39:34] <Snakes_dk> this room
[1:39:34] <+YabbaTroll> he's pogging up
[1:39:36] <Tha_Mik> Noice
[1:39:38] <Make_me_mad> The room I was thinking of had Tyrants in it.
[1:39:40] <%lewdskeletor13> Woolie has gotten way better at the game
[1:39:41] <ghostspartan80> one more room
[1:39:42] <akman14> Drones not real enemies LUL
[1:39:44] <RunningNGunning> When I think of Doom E's combat, this is the room I think of
[1:39:44] <%MrRabbles> the prerequisite ripping and tearing has not been accomplished
[1:39:44] <peachy996> I assumed Sam stole the Father anticipating Khan Maykr exiling him for acting against her will
[1:39:45] <%scrublord009> THE ONLY THINK THEY FEAR IS WOOLIE.mp3
[1:39:47] <pennykettle_> Maykr Drones are fodder enemies like the Zombies, so they arent required for progression
[1:39:49] <VidulaSaix> EVO Moment 37 of Doom
[1:39:50] <%a_goth_pancake> victory!
[1:39:52] <$legacy0117> It's purposely vague, but Samur disappeared after giving Doomguy the Mulligan powers.
[1:39:55] <Mrthefro> My chat is like 1min behind. But just for Woolies channel. Any ideas?
[1:39:59] <SixthSun2> I guess those guys aren't real enemies anymore
[1:40:02] <+SvenHolgersson> HELLO REGGIE oh and I guess Woolie too
[1:40:07] <mark_collins45> I tell you it always happens. The mechanics just click into place and you become a demon grinder.
[1:40:08] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:40:09] <$legacy0117> So, sometime sfter.
[1:40:10] <%Asuterisuku> He did die once though.
[1:40:17] <ghostspartan80> they technically just jobbers
[1:40:18] <dinnydanny777> Does playing on easy mode even make this easier when there are so many enemies
[1:40:19] <%a_goth_pancake> sward
[1:40:24] <%lewdskeletor13> It‚Äôs been cool seeing Woolie get progressively better at the game
[1:40:26] <+Superbro64> contriarian SeriousSloth
[1:40:27] <venomfury86> Drones are ammo pinatas
[1:40:30] <%FuqBoiSlim> @mrthefro are you on the mobile app?
[1:40:32] <%mitchteck> On uv this room is a nighatmare
[1:40:32] <Solidnick18> get that
[1:40:35] <Solidnick18> woo
[1:40:37] <%Javaa01> Yeah, the enemy layouts in this half of the level are brutal, but the arena layouts are fantastic
[1:40:42] <Solidnick18> one more left
[1:40:43] <%Asuterisuku> Nightmare speaks for itself.
[1:40:46] <mark_collins45> @Mrthefro refresh the feed?
[1:40:46] <mdkcde> How are you liking Devil Will Cry woolie?
[1:40:47] <Snakes_dk> i know, he got sp much better
[1:40:48] <Who_lio42> he needs to use a tad more weapon variety but its CLICKED
[1:40:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ez
[1:40:50] <ghostspartan80> on nightmare this room sucks monkey fuck
[1:40:59] <$legacy0117> Or I should say ANGER POWERS.
[1:41:06] <+slimmixrp> You think well see the icon today
[1:41:14] <pennykettle_> I forget what the geology is called, but I dig the stacked pancake rocks
[1:41:17] <peachy996> Hard to say
[1:41:26] <LeeOhX> depends on how much of a gamer woolie is
[1:41:26] <%lewdskeletor13> I want a DMC 5 mod where you play as Doomguy in first person
[1:41:27] <+zetastriker> I feel like even on Nightmare I just powered through Urdak's fights. It wasn't until the next level that I started getting stopped again.
[1:41:34] <pennykettle_> eternal...
[1:41:36] <rytisone> yeah, we got that
[1:41:37] <%Javaa01> !NAP AT RISK!
[1:41:37] <Mrthefro> Ps4 . Neve been a problem tho

[1:42:16] <dinnydanny777> The real Doom was inside us all along
[1:42:17] <%newguy95> I love the way he says "paradise".
[1:42:18] <%Josef_Stryker> Oh man this jump is gonna be a bitch for Woolie
[1:42:21] <pennykettle_> Oh god I hope the DLC increases in difficulty from the final level. It would suck if it were midgame easy
[1:42:23] <Mrthefro> Its been delayed for like a week LUL
[1:42:23] <%Klefth> It's almost like they brought upon themselves... DOOM ETERNAL
[1:42:24] <Who_lio42> she would of drowned 5 times over in her own sauce
[1:42:25] <VidulaSaix> SHE IS DRENCHED
[1:42:26] <venomfury86> this part LUL
[1:42:28] <TheHardM> Heaven wasn't good enough.
[1:42:32] <%seduwu> she drowned
[1:42:32] <%dekkitout> She'd think: "Help me- I'M DROWNING IN MY FROTHING LOINS!"
[1:42:33] <%lewdskeletor13> I want her to show up in the DLC lmao
[1:42:35] <dinnydanny777> How the heck do these guys traverse this crap
[1:42:38] <ghostspartan80> she has the same VA as the Khan Makyr. Coincidence?

[1:42:52] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @SvenHolgersson

[1:43:01] <@Solidus_113> look up
[1:43:03] <VidulaSaix> Woolie's inability to see the giant glowing green things kills me sometimes LUL
[1:43:07] <%lewdskeletor13> She wants his crucible woolieSMUG
[1:43:07] <+LynbellDaYo> playing without air mobility seems terrible
[1:43:09] <dinnydanny777> Do the Maykr's do this jump everytime they wanna get somewhere?

[1:43:26] <%Javaa01> Nope
[1:43:27] <ghostspartan80> the speed run strats for these jumps tho
[1:43:29] <%Shishi1205> Looking up gives you extra lenght and girth

[1:44:48] <%Irridium> Vega = God
[1:44:50] <peachy996> Say bye to Vega by the way
[1:44:51] <brachydios777> Vega is literally GOD

[1:45:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> @lewdskeletor13 Probably a lot-HELLO GORDON! I'M THIRSTY!
[1:45:05] <pennykettle_> Oh yeayeayea right remember that Sam tried to kill god in 2016 and Doomguy was like, imma take this
[1:45:05] <dinnydanny777> Aren't we all supercomputers though, when you think about it
[1:45:07] <%Javaa01> Use God to run at LEAST like 3 instances of Solitaire
[1:45:07] <ghostspartan80> literal Deus Ex Machina
[1:45:13] <anita_dickin> GOD.wav
[1:45:14] <%superc37> Reminder that sam was totally gonna delete god in doom 2016
[1:45:21] <Make_me_mad> Can God run Crysis, though?
[1:45:23] <%lewdskeletor13> Maybe Sam would‚Äôve backed him up if Doomguy hadn‚Äôt
[1:45:28] <Picosunloaded> delete god

[1:45:34] <+Superbro64> "Because I'm FUCKING GOOD"
[1:45:38] <ulcaban> God the power bottom
[1:45:44] <%HitchhikingThrough> I mean it's always watching
[1:45:46] <ghostspartan80> God runs on 5G
[1:45:48] <VidulaSaix> Well they explained it in the lore you already read. The Father was a conciousness that was instilled into the Maykr world itself

[1:46:05] <BaldandBroken> is this game still worth playing? never downloaded it
[1:46:05] <%Asuterisuku> If GOD were the internet, humanity would be extinct.
[1:46:05] <%Shishi1205> remember the lore in 2016 that said that as an AI Vega was super op? Like the recreating of the math proffessor thingy and all of those things?

[1:46:31] <Picosunloaded> @WoolieVersus remember that doom guy saved sam in 2016
[1:46:36] <pennykettle_> there was literally a field of science dedicated to studying the inner workings of god

[1:47:01] <Solidnick18> other side
[1:47:06] <pennykettle_> the one that generates increasingly fucked up porn VHS? @Nested_Dreams
[1:47:11] <%Asuterisuku> This is the only non-linear objective in the game.
[1:47:13] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1270228062764969985

[1:49:07] <%HitchhikingThrough> fucked room huh?
[1:49:08] <%rosemon5001> soo question have we passed the pool area or nahh?
[1:49:10] <%Josef_Stryker> HUGE CUTS FOR HUGE GUTS
[1:49:16] <brachydios777> EZ
[1:49:17] <Nested_Dreams> It was SCP-1004
[1:49:23] <ghostspartan80> Tyrants are my favorite design in this game
[1:49:27] <$legacy0117> Samur doesn't fill those conditions too well.
[1:49:31] <venomfury86> nice headshot
[1:49:32] <pennykettle_> okay if there is a third entry in this modern doom series, I hope we return to Urdak as a total wasteland
[1:49:33] <%FuqBoiSlim> woolie came out the fight with more health and armor than be did starting it. you love to see it
[1:49:36] <Who_lio42> no pools still comin up
[1:49:37] <%Asuterisuku> Seriously though, this level has pumped up Woolie's aim like crazy.
[1:49:41] <Snakes_dk> yes
[1:49:42] <Nested_Dreams> 1kb, infinity possibilities
[1:49:50] <Solidnick18> nope they just bring it down abit
[1:49:54] <%Javaa01> @ghostspartan80 Oh you mean the design from 1993 unchanged and adapted directly?
[1:49:54] <rytisone> get pumped for the next room
[1:49:55] <Solidnick18> for the calm parts
[1:49:59] <%lewdskeletor13> @pennykettle_ It seems that‚Äôs what the DLC will be doing
[1:50:01] <venomfury86> @ghostspartan80 mine are Dread Knights
[1:50:08] <brachydios777> @ghostspartan80 A design lasting from the 90s
[1:50:08] <dinnydanny777> The game is literally saying "get good"
[1:50:15] <derap41> Woolie not a fan of Ruined Orgasms
[1:50:16] <DelgotHansto> I love that the enemies you started out fighting become such fodder that the game doesn't even bother making you finish them off
[1:50:18] <pennykettle_> lewdskeletor13 arent both the dlcs prequels?
[1:50:21] <%lewdskeletor13> Well when a weapon point pops up that usually means it‚Äôs over
[1:50:23] <ghostspartan80> yeah, the design is so strong its literally the same
[1:50:24] <peachy996> game wants to keep you tense for more
[1:50:28] <%HitchhikingThrough> oh the puzzles in this room are fucking dumb
[1:50:29] <Augus7717> !uptime
[1:50:29] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 50 minutes
[1:50:32] <$legacy0117> But kind of the only one that would be trusted wi th h serious shite by the Father.
[1:50:39] <%rosemon5001> pole?
[1:50:41] <$legacy0117> With*
[1:50:41] <JetpackMcQuack> Doom guy can't smell anymore demons around
[1:50:44] <%lewdskeletor13> @pennykettle_ Nope. The first DLC description takes place explicitly after the campaign
[1:50:49] <%Javaa01> Just go up the elevator
[1:50:50] <%HitchhikingThrough> @WoolieVersus it's second floor from what I remember
[1:50:51] <%Asuterisuku> That is not reachable.
[1:50:55] <pennykettle_> @lewdskeletor13 oh wow damn, okay thanks
[1:50:56] <anita_dickin> you'll loop around
[1:50:57] <megamonmon123> its progress
[1:51:10] <%alpacasintophats> you'll loop around to it
[1:51:22] <Solidnick18> he did it
[1:51:22] <TheHardM> Nah, it's a ghost, it's fine.
[1:51:25] <ghostspartan80> Boss time?
[1:51:28] <brachydios777> @pennykettle_ Cross your fingers for a mech segment
[1:51:30] <%Asuterisuku> The Wraiths aren't limited to where they died.
[1:51:31] <venomfury86> too many cookies
[1:51:34] <%lewdskeletor13> They‚Äôre just vibing
[1:51:34] <VidulaSaix> About to? You already let Hell in LUL
[1:51:36] <%Javaa01> Well, I mean, it's already being invaded by demons, so it's already fucked
[1:51:39] <pennykettle_> I dont understand them being spirits, are they projecting themselves? I liked pulling components out of dead guys
[1:51:40] <thatonepassionbentgamer> He knows his duty
[1:51:40] <%haisho> no such thing as too many oreos
[1:51:41] <spidervenomized> it their heaven
[1:51:46] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Time flies when watching good content. Thanks Woolz and crew! Also, if you‚Äôre looking on a good one-off in the meantime, I‚Äôd recommend ‚ÄúThe Friends of Ringo Ishikawa‚Äù A River City Rumble style beat em up, with Shades of GTO.
[1:51:47] <Solidnick18> just need the cheat
[1:51:53] <%Asuterisuku> I hope there's more stuff to spend oreos on in the DLC.
[1:51:54] <RunningNGunning> "Sorry not sorry"
[1:51:57] <%HitchhikingThrough> The idea that these mother fuckers were so G they managed to slay their way through hell straight into heaven is wild
[1:52:00] <ghostspartan80> Soul Oreos
[1:52:11] <megamonmon123> on your left
[1:52:19] <megamonmon123> lets go chat
[1:52:26] <$legacy0117> Yeahhh, breaking the heart contract kinda ruined thei deal.
[1:52:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> earf
[1:52:28] <%lewdskeletor13> Considering you have an overflow of tokens by the end, I think the DLC will add more to spend it on
[1:52:29] <venomfury86> Cool
[1:52:32] <%Asuterisuku> Look at that low-res earth.
[1:52:38] <anita_dickin> The Bifrost
[1:52:40] <%Asuterisuku> That legit looks much better on PC.
[1:52:44] <Solidnick18> thanks optimus
[1:52:45] <ghostspartan80> this kinda reminds me if halo 4 a bit
[1:52:46] <RunningNGunning> Time to go fuck up Thano- I mean the Icon of Sin
[1:52:48] <%SuperKirby24> almost time for "that" fight PogChamp
[1:52:52] <brachydios777> Big portal for big boys
[1:52:52] <TheHardM> The longer the Icon of Sin is on Earth, the stronger he becomes!
[1:52:56] <pennykettle_> I wonder if those ring colors represent anything
[1:52:58] <rytisone> earth looks more high res on pc
[1:53:00] <MKII> don't forget Vega. did we bring a zip drive
[1:53:04] <%Asuterisuku> IS it? HMMMM
[1:53:05] <%lewdskeletor13> The longer the Icon of Sin is on Earth, the stronger it becomes
[1:53:05] <%HitchhikingThrough> @Asuterisuku you aren't wrong, it looks much cleaner

[1:54:38] <%FuqBoiSlim> He HATES it
[1:54:42] <+zetastriker> I do wonder how Sam got his own thing going though. There's that lore entry that says no Makyr can defy the Khan or something.
[1:54:44] <%lewdskeletor13> Pain Elementals are cruel
[1:54:45] <%Shishi1205> check the cool dude in the water
[1:54:50] <venomfury86> i like the all codex achievement name
[1:54:53] <%BisoromiBear> finally makes it to heaven just to clip into a wall for eternity
[1:54:56] <%Asuterisuku> Lost souls, demoted to Pain Elemental attacks for this game.
[1:55:03] <Tha_Mik> Good
[1:55:04] <pennykettle_> @zetastriker there are different levels of maykr I think. the drones cant resist, samur isnt a drone
[1:55:17] <%lewdskeletor13> That was my understanding too
[1:55:20] <peachy996> @pennykettle_ But the lore said all maykr
[1:55:21] <ghostspartan80> Pain Elementals are grandpas with constant back pain
[1:55:22] <TheHardM> 6/75 headshots
[1:55:24] <$legacy0117> And what is Samuel's job, besides guiding spirits through to the afterlife??
[1:55:30] <+zetastriker> Yeah, I think the lore didn't specify drones.
[1:55:32] <%lewdskeletor13> 6/75
[1:55:35] <gunsrlove> big lore time
[1:55:36] <%Asuterisuku> He's up to something like 30 now.
[1:55:38] <pennykettle_> PogChamp
[1:55:38] <+zetastriker> Maybe he just got it in before she said no
[1:55:43] <%HitchhikingThrough> Can't even hate on Woolie for those things, maker drones are a bitch to kill

[1:55:52] <%Asuterisuku> So yeah, those are the Angels.
[1:55:53] <brachydios777> Samur is a rare exception

[1:57:34] <%SuperKirby24> LUL
[1:57:35] <dinnydanny777> I keep expecting it to move
[1:57:36] <gunsrlove> It's Khan Maykr's replacement or ancestor
[1:57:36] <%LTKonnor> Why does it have a testicle in its chest
[1:57:37] <%Ecchigun> CRISPY

[1:57:42] <DelgotHansto> Kinda just looks like a gargoyle
[1:57:42] <$BrazenMask> hes either dead or braindead
[1:57:42] <%HitchhikingThrough> LOOK AT OUR GUTS MODEL FOR THE MAKYR. WE THOUGHT IT WAS SO SICK WE MADE IT PART OF THE LEVEL
[1:57:43] <TheHardM> They're all gooey.

[1:57:44] <%a_goth_pancake> you're one... UGLY... motherfucker
[1:57:46] <mark_collins45> Shin Maykr
[1:57:47] <ghostspartan80> heaven comes with tentacles
[1:57:48] <%dekkitout> They can bleed
[1:57:49] <%Asuterisuku> They still have guts.
[1:57:50] <%Binary_Fireball> I would eat it
[1:57:52] <TheHardM> Ripe for both ripping and/or tearing.
[1:57:52] <brachydios777> Literally Bayonetta
[1:57:53] <DeathByPoke7> they have GUTS
[1:57:53] <rytisone> Mother Demon? final boss of doom 64

[1:58:00] <%Neoepochx> Punished Makyr
[1:58:00] <%brunoberserk> THIS A AAAALIEEENNN
[1:58:03] <%Pillagius> Yea, it's probably one of the previous Khan Makyrs
[1:58:04] <alphalejandro> The Maykrs look a lot like the Mother Demon from Doom 64
[1:58:04] <pennykettle_> I love this room because they just show you and move on
[1:58:06] <Who_lio42> yeah Im assuming its what the NEXT kahn was supposed to be but with daddy gone its dead
[1:58:08] <+Ether101_Prime> I don't think that its armor. It seems to be an actual part of their body.
[1:58:09] <%alpacasintophats> pretty sure this a dead one
[1:58:10] <Nested_Dreams> Argent Fried Maykr
[1:58:10] <%haisho> it has no feet of course Reggie wouldn't
[1:58:17] <StarlitStunner> No feet, Reggie‚Äôs not interested
[1:58:18] <ghostspartan80> definitely gained some insight
[1:58:18] <dinnydanny777> Why is this preserved?
[1:58:20] <%Asuterisuku> The only water in the game that isn't toxic.
[1:58:24] <ralphfromdk> legacy0117 Yes and no. Sam stole the father so there could not be made any more Khans, so she has to keep using argent energy to stay alive as the last of her kind.
[1:58:32] <arkv01> its like dried squid
[1:58:32] <$legacy0117> What do you think it REALLY IS WOOLIE??
[1:58:34] <@Solidus_113> false gods
[1:58:37] <ghostspartan80> purple LCL
[1:58:41] <+ALazo> It's good to know that they ugly
[1:58:46] <@Solidus_113> it can bleed
[1:58:47] <venomfury86> Bayonetta
[1:58:48] <derap41> IF IT BLEEED WE CAN KILL IT!
[1:58:55] <DelgotHansto> The big reveal being that they wear clothes
[1:58:55] <brachydios777> @dinnydanny777 My guess this was a previous or supposed to have been the next Khan
[1:58:56] <%dekkitout> We got grape crush instead of orange tang
[1:58:57] <DedlokPM> @Ether101_Prime he was saying the "robot" look is the armor not what he was looking at just now
[1:58:58] <LeeOhX> its good to know that they're flesh...means you can kill em
[1:58:59] <%Javaa01> That's it
[1:59:01] <%Neoepochx> Fasttravel upcoming
[1:59:02] <rytisone> you saw what you needed
[1:59:06] <Who_lio42> kahn makyr can still hmu w those tendrils tho
[1:59:09] <%Neoepochx> You can get the sword ammo now
[1:59:12] <%Asuterisuku> You can go back and get that sword ammo.
[1:59:12] <@Solidus_113> get that sword ammo if you can
[1:59:14] <ghostspartan80> does it have HUGE GUTS?
[1:59:15] <arkv01> they have soft fleshy bits, they can be ripped and torn
[1:59:20] <Solidnick18> that is everything
[1:59:22] <%rosemon5001> go get the sword ammo
[1:59:26] <dinnydanny777> But we can kill God too
[1:59:26] <RogueMinja> Now go grab that sword.
[1:59:27] <$legacy0117> Sounds like something THE ANGEL OF DEATH would do, if he couldn't COLLECT on as SOUL.
[1:59:32] <peachy996> I mean you could get the Crucible pip
[1:59:33] <%dekkitout> Why is it a biggy tho
[1:59:33] <%alpacasintophats> grab sword shot
[1:59:33] <%cylish> Very Bayonetta
[1:59:36] <$legacy0117> on a*
[1:59:36] <Tha_Mik> It has guts
[1:59:37] <snorlaxbud> WE CAN KILL IT
[1:59:41] <alphalejandro> Go for your sword peep Woolie
[1:59:41] <Snakes_dk> doom lore is very bayonetta now
[1:59:46] <%Ashenik1> ...
[1:59:47] <%Pillagius> Enemies die when you kill them, yea
[1:59:47] <Solidnick18> jeez
[1:59:47] <+zetastriker> Woolie saying "the implication" made me realize the Khan Makyr uses the Dennis system on new worlds.
[1:59:48] <%Javaa01> So then go kill it
[1:59:49] <%HitchhikingThrough> Japan has run that trope so far into the ground that the west is using it now
[1:59:50] <%FusRoDom> Boo this man
[1:59:52] <Tucker0603> i can fuck it
[1:59:53] <%Klefth> Woolie....
[1:59:58] <%Javaa01> You won't need the sword here

[2:00:10] <DelgotHansto> Cause you couldn't kill a creature who is need of a tampon
[2:00:14] <mark_collins45> It might be the original Khan Maykr
[2:00:15] <arkv01> EYYYYYY
[2:00:22] <ghostspartan80> if it bleeds we can fuck it

[2:02:46] <Nomad94> It's important to know that disabling her shield INSTANTLY recharges Blood Punch!
[2:02:46] <thatonepassionbentgamer> how would doomguy get this info now that VEGA is out of his system?

[2:03:28] <megamonmon123> lock on is your best friend
[2:03:32] <+zetastriker> Ballista mods do less DPS than normal shots on her
[2:03:34] <+zetastriker> It's weird
[2:03:34] <VickytheCarWash> blood punch auto refills if you break her shield so dont worry about recharging blood punch
[2:03:37] <%Reveresao> ROCKETS

[2:03:46] <ralphfromdk> This is gonna be a loooong fight.
[2:03:46] <Make_me_mad> The tutorials for these boss fights are a bit much. It'd be worth it, though, if it just led to a boss fight against a Tyrant and the tutorial box appeared and told you to shoot it until it died.
[2:03:47] <pennykettle_> this is going to be a long fight
[2:03:49] <venomfury86> Pat said this boss fight was easier than the final
[2:03:52] <megamonmon123> yes
[2:03:52] <%Asuterisuku> No more extra lives, gotta do it raw.
[2:03:52] <%HitchhikingThrough> how much damage does that chain gun do holy shit?

[2:04:18] <pennykettle_> doomguy for smash... cmon
[2:04:18] <%seduwu> this fight was mad easy but apparently people found it hard
[2:04:22] <megamonmon123> this boss is gonna be fun
[2:04:22] <gunsrlove> Oh no, accuracy needed
[2:04:25] <%lewdskeletor13> Fuck them angels
[2:04:25] <%HitchhikingThrough> ...you can use the ice grenades before you headshot them, I'm stupid
[2:04:26] <%haisho> man these drones still creep me out with how they sound
[2:04:34] <LeeOhX> Its tough the first cpuple of times
[2:04:35] <GarbageNirvana> It's hard if you only use certain weapons
[2:04:36] <%LynbellDaYo> normal shots seem stronger
[2:04:43] <megamonmon123> yeah rocket is good here
[2:04:44] <ghostspartan80> the floor turning into lava was the hard part
[2:04:45] <RogueMinja> The area of denial in this fight was really ahard for me, haha.
[2:04:47] <+Ether101_Prime> You can also quick scope them.
[2:04:48] <Mrthefro> It is easier
[2:04:51] <pennykettle_> It took me like 5 tries
[2:04:52] <dinnydanny777> No way is this the whole fight
[2:05:03] <%HitchhikingThrough> @WoolieVersus boss can and absolutely will heal
[2:05:07] <GarbageNirvana> The health regen is a pain in the ass regardless
[2:05:07] <%Th3SmartAlec> Fire = bad
[2:05:08] <%BisoromiBear> fire bad
[2:05:10] <Solidnick18> LUL
[2:05:14] <TheHardM> Shield go UP
[2:05:14] <LeeOhX> also the shield regens if you're not always on top of that
[2:05:14] <dinnydanny777> Ah it heals, got it
[2:05:17] <@Solidus_113> save that
[2:05:19] <ghostspartan80> use lock on rockets
[2:05:19] <$legacy0117> Ah, the pips above her shield bar is her health. 6 more blood punches BOIS
[2:05:20] <megamonmon123> rockets good, fire bad
[2:05:20] <pennykettle_> UNMAYK HER
[2:05:24] <Snakes_dk> its the fire attacks that got me
[2:05:24] <rytisone> it just might
[2:05:28] <Picosunloaded> boi
[2:05:30] <peachy996> Do not use the BFG on her
[2:05:36] <%LynbellDaYo> health up on that rock
[2:05:37] <spidervenomized> accuracy woolie
[2:05:38] <Anr1ck> Lock on bazooka helps a lot here
[2:05:39] <%seduwu> unmaykher
[2:05:40] <@Solidus_113> ON THE PIXEL
[2:05:43] <MasterTonberry23> really nailing those head shots woolz

[2:05:59] <%a_goth_pancake> you can hop between them safely.
[2:06:00] <Solidnick18> cronch
[2:06:00] <%Pillagius> Woolie, I think this "divine" gardening tool is real mad right now woolieCHAN woolieCHAN
[2:06:01] <venomfury86> easy
[2:06:01] <Make_me_mad> Meathooking the drones and shotgunning their head at point blank range is my preferred strategy.
[2:06:02] <MasterTonberry23> Knocked off the platform too
[2:06:02] <%BisoromiBear> that was a warm up
[2:06:04] <%Javaa01> Learn to shoot, the boss fight
[2:06:04] <megamonmon123> rockets MELT her
[2:06:05] <LeeOhX> what got me all the time was not moving around wnough
[2:06:11] <%FuqBoiSlim> bodied
[2:06:13] <MKII> only way to heal. it's tough
[2:06:16] <ghostspartan80> avoid lava the boss
[2:06:20] <%HitchhikingThrough> @WoolieVersus that thing where you ice grenaded then quickscoped is great
[2:06:22] <%seduwu> rockets are really good against her
[2:06:23] <DedlokPM> REGA
[2:06:28] <%rosemon5001> lol they would make the drone headshots a tip for this fight
[2:06:28] <VidulaSaix> Did Reggie just say he'd be Woolie's God
[2:06:33] <Nested_Dreams> Just click on the heads Keepo
[2:06:35] <%alpacasintophats> rockets are *stupid* good against her

[2:06:58] <TheHardM> Shield go UP
[2:07:04] <DelgotHansto> Gotta keep the rhythm up or that shield will heal
[2:07:06] <rytisone> use combo
[2:07:08] <ghostspartan80> Shoot fast and hard

[2:09:59] <$legacy0117> Sooooo now you notice she has the s as me tentacles as Samur.
[2:10:01] <%DesertPenguin> Did they add in that you can see her behind cover like that?
[2:10:04] <+Mkingston> You're fuckin' down with the sickness
[2:10:05] <@Solidus_113> HEADSHOTS

[2:10:07] <%SuperKirby24> F
[2:10:09] <%rosemon5001> its good enough just the aim is the issue
[2:10:09] <CoffeeSlice> headshots
[2:10:11] <peachy996> ded
[2:10:11] <megamonmon123> you'll get it
[2:10:12] <MasterTonberry23> Its fine, that was a practice run
[2:10:13] <+yamchadassist> Freeze bomb into headshot all day
[2:10:13] <+zetastriker> I just bursted her with repeated BFGs at the end like that
[2:10:13] <+dmtjinni> F
[2:10:18] <TheHardM> Maykers have tentacles.
[2:10:19] <%HitchhikingThrough> @WoolieVersus try ice grenades then headshots
[2:10:20] <%Atomik456> rip
[2:10:21] <youthgonewild77> F
[2:10:22] <brachydios777> NotLikeThis
[2:10:23] <%Javaa01> Throw that shotgun in the trash and get good
[2:10:26] <$Rumbutt> BFG is better than Unmakyr here
[2:10:28] <%Tugg_boat> Good try
[2:10:32] <%SuperKirby24> yeah, last 2 bars are when things get wild
[2:10:32] <mark_collins45> headshot for resources
[2:10:34] <Who_lio42> shotgun sticky bombs can be USED FOR HEADSHOT
[2:10:36] <ghostspartan80> ballista + rocket combo
[2:10:36] <SuperChumps> This fight looks so easy on baby mode.
[2:10:38] <DelgotHansto> UNMAKYR takes her down even quicker at close range
[2:10:42] <%seduwu> please headshot them it gives chainsaw resources
[2:10:49] <LeeOhX> woolie try using the sticky grenades for the other shotgun to get those headshots maybe?
[2:10:53] <%DesertPenguin> @WoolieVersus Use the meat hook to grapple across the arena. It's known in the speed run community as a Yeet Hook
[2:11:04] <%LynbellDaYo> stop letting your damage go to waste
[2:11:04] <MasterTonberry23> Max made headshotting those drones look so easy :P
[2:11:04] <$legacy0117> Short Chronos hop shots helppppppp

[2:11:53] <%HitchhikingThrough> @WoolieVersus you have it automatically
[2:11:56] <%LynbellDaYo> you will get bloodpunch
[2:11:59] <%Javaa01> Bloodpunch gets refuiled every time she goes into stun
[2:12:05] <%Javaa01> So don't worry about it
[2:12:06] <megamonmon123> you always get it when shes stunned woolie
[2:12:11] <$legacy0117> Kratos already did that.
[2:12:13] <Who_lio42> dont w about it blood punch refills on it s own here
[2:12:13] <peachy996> Freeze then Headshot
[2:12:15] <ghostspartan80> 100% ultra nightmare runs are insane

[2:16:38] <dinnydanny777> I just notices but this music sounds like chiptune
[2:16:42] <$legacy0117> Drones are annoying too, since you can't kill these with glory kills O think.
[2:16:46] <+tearfuldevil> @SuperChumps there's a difficulty below normal so...
[2:16:49] <$legacy0117> I*
[2:16:58] <venomfury86> i don't think we will see the final level
[2:16:59] <SuperChumps> @tearfuldevil baby mode
[2:17:08] <%DesertPenguin> Depending on how this goes, Woolie may be exhausted or pumped up
[2:17:18] <%emperordread> the jukes
[2:17:19] <%DesertPenguin> Use a different gun for fuck's sake lol
[2:17:21] <ghostspartan80> yeah the next fights DO NOT let up
[2:17:21] <brachydios777> Headshot with chaingun seemed good
[2:17:23] <peachy996> Oh we'll get to the Final level I don't know if we'll get to the Icon of Sin
[2:17:29] <peachy996> Woolie's got this
[2:17:36] <$legacy0117> If not, that means another round DOOM Eternal.
[2:17:36] <CoffeeSlice> LUL
[2:17:37] <dinnydanny777> Is the music kind of 8 bit or is it just me
[2:17:38] <+tearfuldevil> @SuperChumps yes yes, you're so impressive for playing fps' on higher difficulties, im awed by your hand eye cordination, your kdr is so big
[2:17:39] <VidulaSaix> Booty Butt Cheeks

[2:17:47] <DedlokPM> BUTT PUNCH rooH
[2:17:47] <rytisone> Tag: Fisting
[2:17:48] <Solidnick18> right in the booty
[2:17:49] <Make_me_mad> Icon of Sin is comparatively pretty easy.
[2:17:51] <%dekkitout> "Please don't break my butt!"
[2:17:52] <%HitchhikingThrough> Not enough
[2:17:53] <%lewdskeletor13> Hit it from the back
[2:17:59] <+Mkingston> Fisting God
[2:18:00] <Halospaz117> This guys comes by and slaps your god on the ass, what do you do?
[2:18:13] <%DesertPenguin> Chaingun Shield is best for you to get headshots safely
[2:18:24] <%Neoepochx> You can headshot frozen enemies it'll make using the scope easier for you.
[2:18:37] <ghostspartan80> beat her ass
[2:18:41] <$legacy0117> Also I am glad you see her through objects, that'd make this fight so much more difficult if you couldn't.
[2:18:41] <%GeneralSCPatton> HEADSHOT FROZEN DRONES
[2:18:45] <+hod_fareview> In a game that discourages the halting of movement in battle, Woolie remains stagnant.
[2:18:45] <%HitchhikingThrough> ^^
[2:18:46] <dinnydanny777> It seems like if you use the shield these enemies can't really hit you
[2:18:47] <%DesertPenguin> That too. Freeze them so they don't move
[2:18:47] <%seduwu> the pop sound effects on the headshot is great
[2:18:49] <@Solidus_113> spicy floors
[2:19:01] <+Ether101_Prime> It seems that quick scoping the drones will have the icon on their head for a second.
[2:19:02] <venomfury86> Woolie loves the super shotgun too much
[2:19:06] <CoffeeSlice> PogChamp
[2:19:09] <%Neoepochx> Using the shotgun is really random for headshots

[2:21:58] <%DesertPenguin> You only get it on the last level, fucking pointless
[2:21:58] <%Neoepochx> @BallerSwagBro9k I thought it was the Dark Lord. I imagine without Maykrs they will have a harder time just going to dimensions/worlds to consume
[2:22:02] <%HitchhikingThrough> I know right?
[2:22:03] <CoffeeSlice> o boi
[2:22:09] <%lewdskeletor13> People think it might be The Dark Lord since there‚Äôs a VA listed for the Dark Lord in the credits but he never shows up
[2:22:11] <venomfury86> YEYEYEYE
[2:22:14] <ghostspartan80> two blood punches changes the game

[2:22:35] <%DesertPenguin> Vega is Father?
[2:22:36] <%HitchhikingThrough> @WoolieVersus its a great boss. Sure glad that was the final boss and that there aren't any more after that
[2:22:37] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @lewdskeletor13 Dataminers confirmed it with the audio filr
[2:22:39] <gunsrlove> It's probably the Dark Lord, mentioned in several lore pieces, she DID have a deal with Hell
[2:22:39] <%LynbellDaYo> i mean it could be, but seems off
[2:22:47] <$legacy0117> So, she was a Demon all along I believe.

[2:43:09] <%superc37> there is no crouch guys
[2:43:11] <ghostspartan80> not go downstairs and shoot at a target
[2:43:17] <+hod_fareview> NO CROUCH
[2:43:19] <peachy996> Doomguy suddenly misses the crouch button
[2:43:19] <%LynbellDaYo> pretty sure they were joking
[2:43:25] <dinnydanny777> Wait doesn't no crouch mean you can't strafe jump properly
[2:43:25] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1270228062764969985

[2:45:04] <%Th3SmartAlec> @dinnydanny777 Nope Jebaited
[2:45:08] <VidulaSaix> guess Mick should've met his deadline Kappa
[2:45:23] <DelgotHansto> Can't wait for them to make the 3rd modern doom another horror title
[2:45:25] <+zetastriker> I mean, the deadline only existed because they promised the OST with the Deluxe edition

[2:45:41] <TheAmazingClaytor> SourPls
[2:45:42] <VidulaSaix> It existed because he agreed to it.
[2:45:44] <+zetastriker> But Mick shouldn't have spread rumors and pretended he didn't know what was going on. He's at fault for cutting ties
[2:45:54] <%DesertPenguin> Yea it's a bitch

[2:46:09] <%DesertPenguin> I love that slowmo weapon select. So juicy
[2:46:10] <Solidnick18> SourPls
[2:46:11] <%HitchhikingThrough> @pennykettle_ as per usual, the end of the game gets squeezed into the end.

[2:52:36] <RichochetForce> @pennykettle_ Nah, even on HMP this stage is incredible. Only one thing lets it down.
[2:52:39] <thatonepassionbentgamer> crapping out green bricks
[2:52:39] <venomfury86> The way the Marauder fights, it reminds me of a Bloodborne npc hunter

[2:52:56] <pennykettle_> ive lost FeelsBadMan
[2:53:01] <DelgotHansto> Good to hear that considering the amount of scrubquotes worthy posts complaining about marauder
[2:53:02] <@Solidus_113> FeelsBadMan
[2:53:05] <%Th3SmartAlec> IVE LOST
[2:53:20] <ghostspartan80> Marauder made noobs salty

[2:53:48] <rytisone> Daisy on top of Syrenity

[2:54:14] <Snakes_dk> this room
[2:54:15] <+hoenhime344> rememebr when woolie started and couldnt get past the blue electric room?
[2:54:17] <%RioGascar> I think this is probably the best fight in the game for me
[2:54:18] <+zetastriker> THIS was the hardest fight for me on Nightmare
[2:54:20] <Tha_Mik> It's gonna get better
[2:54:20] <+Mkingston> This fucking room
[2:54:21] <Second_Omega> FINAL FUCK ROOM
[2:54:22] <+zetastriker> But it was amazing.

[2:54:28] <peachy996> The Fun Building
[2:54:28] <%newguy95> this room is rough
[2:54:32] <ghostspartan80> Hardest arena fight in the game for sure
[2:54:32] <Kidbizzaro> The absolute state of the party
[2:54:34] <@Solidus_113> It's fucking party time
[2:54:34] <%HitchhikingThrough> @Second_Omega to be fair, if you don't know how to maximize your damage, he can feel tedious. That Ballista/SS combo is vital.
[2:54:39] <%FuqBoiSlim> The Bloodborne Party Cave Pt 2
[2:54:44] <+Mkingston> no point in saving the sword
[2:54:45] <venomfury86> This room!

[2:54:49] <RichochetForce> Vweem weem vweem vweem

[2:56:33] <%SuperKirby24> just a little more till the funhouse LUL
[2:56:36] <%chiluzza> oh man i remember this tower even whe you think its over its not
[2:56:50] <%HitchhikingThrough> @Second_Omega to be clear by what I mean, I think that without the Ballista/SS technique, he doesn't have enough gimmicks to justify that healthbar. With it though it's well balanced and fun
[2:56:52] <RichochetForce> @chiluzza Yup, this is THE room.
[2:56:55] <ghostspartan80> this is just PART 1 of the tower
[2:56:55] <MasterTonberry23> Reggie you gotta maintain the commentary. Woolie has to focus
[2:57:01] <%seduwu> i hated this room so much
[2:57:09] <RichochetForce> @HitchhikingThrough He gets punked by remote rockets and grenades as well
[2:57:10] <+zetastriker> Haha, for real. He can't afford to get LP brain in this fight.
[2:57:10] <@Solidus_113> Bwoop woop woop woooooop

[2:57:46] <ghostspartan80> Great Job!
[2:57:46] <%seduwu> woolie is not ready for the next part
[2:57:53] <RichochetForce> @seduwu =)
[2:57:55] <Second_Omega> @HitchhikingThrough That does make sense, but that loop isn't the only method of dealing damage, stil the health bar is VERY Long with standard strats
[2:58:06] <%HitchhikingThrough> can we take a moment to appreciate woolie didn't accidentally blow himself up with that rocket
[2:58:07] <%BisoromiBear> BONK
[2:58:13] <DelgotHansto> I need a comparison of Woolie legitemately nearly dying to the three zombies in the first room to now
[2:58:23] <Second_Omega> He has finally learned to avoid splash damage
[2:58:29] <%FuqBoiSlim> Woolie is at the end of his character arc
[2:58:35] <%DesertPenguin> burn and explode
[2:58:36] <@Solidus_113> SAVOR
[2:58:43] <ghostspartan80> splash damage in this game wasn't as harsh compared to 2016 imo
[2:58:59] <rytisone> wall
[2:59:03] <%Javaa01> That 1 up is later, for now, keep going up and fight anything that comes in your way
[2:59:15] <%Neoepochx> Look for green
[2:59:22] <+zetastriker> I don't know @ghostspartan80 it seems like more than the small amount you took after getting the upgrades that reduce self-damage in 2016
[2:59:25] <pennykettle_> SourPls
[2:59:25] <@Solidus_113> OH YOU THOUGHT?
[2:59:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> Reggie with theeyeballs
[2:59:27] <RichochetForce> lol
[2:59:28] <%HitchhikingThrough> @Second_Omega yeah, I guess the weird thing is that unlike every other enemy, normal strats make the fight kinda tedious. Don't get that feeling from the doom hunter for whatever reason. Not necessarily a bad thing, but mentioning the alternate strats in a menu somewhere would have been nice
[2:59:28] <anita_dickin> NOT YET
[2:59:28] <%FuqBoiSlim> green I'd go
[2:59:28] <Solidnick18> SourPls
[2:59:28] <rytisone> but wait, there's more
[2:59:28] <Tha_Mik> Music starts
[2:59:29] <+einherjarvalk> IT'S NOT OVER YET
[2:59:30] <Second_Omega> DID YOU THINK

[2:59:49] <%DesertPenguin> You keep using the shotgun from too far away. It's useless like that
[2:59:49] <Solidnick18> Kreygasm

[3:00:23] <RichochetForce> Doom: Dentistry Eternal
[3:00:24] <+zetastriker> I got screwed here because I had almost no ammo after the previous fight, and it's a bit before grunt enemies show up here
[3:00:24] <%andrex2311> just made it! what did I miss?
[3:00:26] <TheAmazingClaytor> DELETED

[3:01:09] <%HitchhikingThrough> I'd say wrong gun but it payed off
[3:01:10] <alphalejandro> Are we in the Bethesda offices?
[3:01:15] <ghostspartan80> Barons are very easy to avoid at least
[3:01:16] <%Javaa01> Cracked wall

[3:01:21] <%Javaa01> On the flesh pillar
[3:01:21] <megamonmon123> cracked wall
[3:01:22] <Second_Omega> @HitchhikingThrough I feel out of the tutorial it gives being the very simple "Its vulnerable when green/directly after attacking" Leaves room for creativity, its just unfortunate that The Loop is just very, Very effective.
[3:01:24] <+hod_fareview> There was a breakable
[3:01:25] <$legacy0117> This level is so consistently in your face, I kind of wish the whole game was like this, at least the DLCs might be like this.
[3:01:25] <megamonmon123> go back
[3:01:27] <hassanico2> Barons being weird flame men feels odd
[3:01:32] <venomfury86> Frustration is getting bigger, BANG BANG BANG pull my Slayer Trigger!!!
[3:01:41] <negrosnake9185> Breakable wall
[3:01:43] <%Neoepochx> Cracked wall for extra life

[3:01:48] <%Shishi1205> Satan has recalled them

[3:02:56] <ghostspartan80> Cultist base has two tyrants at the start
[3:02:57] <$legacy0117> But that's part of the fun, I would think, but I guess not for some fllks.
[3:03:07] <$legacy0117> folks*
[3:03:10] <%HitchhikingThrough> @Second_Omega I think the plasma rifle working on the shield would have been good. Not as effective as actually waiting for its guard to drop, but it would at the very least mean you didn't have to worry about accidentally shooting the shield when room clearing other enemies
[3:03:12] <blaggablag> It's a nice dance of mayhem

[3:04:27] <Second_Omega> @HitchhikingThrough Encouraging alternative Options that while not as effective are still methods to either expose a week point or keep a distance would of course be best, BUt as it is I think its fine.

[3:05:32] <%Javaa01> Yes, if you see one in an arena, that means the devs expect you to also use one
[3:05:35] <DelgotHansto> @hassanico2 either his left where he stops your punch kinda like the fury buster from dmc 5, or his axe holster where you give him an execution and toss his axe

[3:34:35] <%HitchhikingThrough> @somekindaspy what was # 1?
[3:34:42] <somekindaspy> @HitchhikingThrough the cyberdemon
[3:34:42] <%Neoepochx> Blood punch refills
[3:34:42] <%dekkitout> Oof- he's all gristle
[3:34:42] <+Mkingston> sword
[3:34:47] <RogueMinja> Sword.
[3:34:49] <%HitchhikingThrough> @somekindaspy then what was # 2?
[3:34:50] <pennykettle_> I liked how long it took to get to the first boss in 2016
[3:34:52] <somekindaspy> @WoolieVersus you have a sword!
[3:34:53] <%Shishi1205> Swor them
[3:34:55] <+zetastriker> Two of this game's bosses are glorified super heavies, it really has three bosses
[3:34:56] <CoffeeSlice> LUL
[3:34:56] <Solidnick18> lol
[3:34:57] <RichochetForce> Wow

[3:34:58] <MKII> watch the fist
[3:34:59] <%SuperKirby24> LUL
[3:35:01] <venomfury86> Cyber Demon, Guardians and Spider Mastermind
[3:35:03] <pennykettle_> the knight things that the crucible lived in @HitchhikingThrough
[3:35:06] <%GeneralSCPatton> YOU'LL COWARDS DON'T EVEN SMOKE ARGENT
[3:35:11] <%HitchhikingThrough> oh come on that wasn't a boss fight
[3:35:13] <%HitchhikingThrough> I mean
[3:35:16] <+zetastriker> I think Gladiator is the best boss, but the other 2016 bosses beat Khan Makyr and this
[3:35:17] <$legacy0117> If he tries to swipe or punch you, try to cleave him with the Sword!
[3:35:17] <%HitchhikingThrough> not that this is a boss fight either
[3:35:18] <DelgotHansto> The Icon of Sin used: Limit Break: Meteor Rain
[3:35:21] <+paladinstarbuster> SHOOT HIS DICK
[3:35:21] <%Neoepochx> That should might need another hit
[3:35:29] <%dekkitout> 4/8, 16/75
[3:35:32] <DeeVee_TV> bonk
[3:35:34] <somekindaspy> get a glory kill!
[3:35:34] <CoffeeSlice> OOOOOOOO
[3:35:35] <Nomad94> @zetastriker I don't even remember any bosses in 2016 aside from the final boss
[3:35:35] <TheLemuroid> Oh. He's this far already.
[3:35:36] <mark_collins45> Manos!
[3:35:37] <RichochetForce> @zetastriker Yeah, this is a crappy way of ending the stage and game
[3:35:37] <alphalejandro> crush
[3:35:37] <thatonepassionbentgamer> niiiiiice

[3:36:20] <DelgotHansto> Was gonna mock pat for dying the most in this room when woolies doing fine but then remembered he was an Ultra Violence
[3:36:21] <$legacy0117> Blood punch VS Titan punch. AWESOME.
[3:36:21] <%RadicalWeegee> This Friend is spitten!
[3:36:22] <%lewdskeletor13> woolieSMUG
[3:36:22] <%Th3SmartAlec> Ooooh that's a new one PogChamp
[3:36:25] <RichochetForce> @Nomad94 Compared to the rest of this stage? It's crap. Large, meatwall enemies are low tier. Permanently.
[3:36:26] <SheefEatsBeef> I SPIT THAT
[3:36:28] <+tearfuldevil> and woolies having fun, so eh
[3:36:31] <somekindaspy> aim for his arms
[3:36:31] <%Neoepochx> Right shoulder and left arm
[3:36:32] <Tha_Mik> This fight is a step up compared to the original
[3:36:35] <+toastybites> I'm not a rapper

[3:36:46] <%Josef_Stryker> Shoulder
[3:36:47] <Nomad94> @RichochetForce lol no
[3:36:49] <%Josef_Stryker> Shoulder?
[3:36:51] <somekindaspy> aim for his hand
[3:36:52] <pennykettle_> If only we could have just fought the Icon of Sin as a relatively normal sized enemy by piloting an equal sized mecha
[3:37:00] <GarbageNirvana> Eat dat BBQ
[3:37:01] <%FuqBoiSlim> body shots
[3:37:01] <%jepupu> Left shoulder
[3:37:02] <%Gruhunchously> Is that the ICON OF SIN?
[3:37:04] <DelgotHansto> Hidden 3rd phase of the icon is just a screaming wall with a head
[3:37:05] <anita_dickin> BOSS TIP: shoot it till it dies
[3:37:07] <Second_Omega> Body body body upper
[3:37:08] <%Shishi1205> SWORD
[3:37:08] <%Th3SmartAlec> TWIST HIS DICK
[3:37:10] <extradopeness> Sweet dolla tea from McDonald's
[3:37:26] <DelgotHansto> For how long Woolie took in Urdak the icon of sin doesn't seem that powerful at all
[3:37:30] <RichochetForce> @Nomad94 We'll just have to agree to disagree. But Icon of Sin as a Marauder sized enemy > this. I know this is an homage to the Icon of Sin wall fight in the original Doom, but come on.
[3:37:30] <EsotericOdyssey> woolie please use the crucible sword
[3:37:31] <+krabsan> Look at all this swordammo
[3:37:31] <Halospaz117> @Th3SmartAlec Oh my god dude, this is an MMA fight!

[3:37:50] <somekindaspy> Abs and left shoulder
[3:37:54] <somekindaspy> (our left)
[3:37:54] <$legacy0117> For real, this thing is swinging around his arms and it is stripped to the damn bone.

[3:38:04] <somekindaspy> he's a demon super weapon
[3:38:05] <pennykettle_> someone smoke this guys meats

[3:42:23] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ITS A WHAT NOW ENDING
[3:42:24] <%Neoepochx> Still some lingering questions.
[3:42:24] <RunningNGunning> There are about 10 mins of credits just so you know
[3:42:25] <peachy996> It'll be a long credits though
[3:42:26] <%invader_rin> DLC
[3:42:26] <%SuperKirby24> LOOKAT ALL THOSE DEVS YEY
[3:42:27] <+Mkingston> Great tattoo on the left
[3:42:27] <+green715> They posted DLC screenshots. You're going back to fallen Urdak
[3:42:28] <DelgotHansto> The deal is that he went back at the end of 2016 and they WERE ALREADY INVADING
[3:42:28] <somekindaspy> Story DLC will continue the story!
[3:42:30] <pennykettle_> no mecha fight tho
[3:42:30] <DatAsuna> It's kind of anti climatic yeah
[3:42:31] <anita_dickin> Good on sam for not stealing the fortress like i thought he would
[3:42:36] <arkv01> really wow uh
[3:42:39] <DeathByPoke7> questions like Robots?
[3:42:41] <QaizerArt> Last reminder, Don't Skip The Credits.
[3:42:43] <DatAsuna> Eh
[3:42:45] <+arancet> i wanted a mech, and...
[3:42:45] <$legacy0117> KAR EN TUK. It is done, till you, Samuel, and Betrayer go downstairs to FINISH the job.
[3:42:46] <Visorak6> NO MECH BATTLE
[3:42:46] <dinnydanny777> Exceeded your expectations
[3:42:47] <%rosemon5001> you didnt get the mech
[3:42:49] <Snakes_dk> LUL
[3:42:50] <DatAsuna> He's more like the reamrunner than vergil
[3:42:51] <%Th3SmartAlec> You wanted a mech... you were denied
[3:42:54] <%Neoepochx> But hook?
[3:42:54] <rytisone> I wanted to pilot that mecha in the base
[3:42:55] <venomfury86> @anita_dickin Same
[3:42:55] <%Shishi1205> BUT PURPLE
[3:42:58] <MrSparkle21> There is dlc on the way

[3:43:02] <%Theycallmenerf> Twist his dick
[3:43:04] <alphalejandro> NO MECH THOU
[3:43:05] <pennykettle_> that finale should have been a mecha battle
[3:43:06] <%Gruhunchously> TRICKSTER
[3:43:06] <ghostspartan80> this is an improvement on every level
[3:43:07] <+Mkingston> I want that image on the left as a tattoo.
[3:43:09] <DatAsuna> Partly cause marauder is a generic enemy
[3:43:10] <%lewdskeletor13> Maybe mech in the DLC :(
[3:43:13] <%Neoepochx> Trickster + Gunslinger
[3:43:13] <somekindaspy> Story will continue with the DLC. It will be a full-on story with new demons.
[3:43:15] <%Iwashi94> LUL
[3:43:16] <%Theycallmenerf> But no mechs :/

[3:43:34] <CoffeeSlice> DLC HYPE
[3:43:37] <+Mkingston> The Doom Wars DLC
[3:43:38] <Tha_Mik> 10/10 not enough mechs
[3:43:39] <lotharrio> Mechedge?
[3:43:40] <ArtooKilledYou> Mech maybe??
[3:43:41] <MasterTonberry23> Would you say it subverted your expectations Kappa
[3:43:41] <pennykettle_> there will be no dlc mech, youre kidding yourselves
[3:43:41] <ghostspartan80> a tease gets you quaking for the dlcs
[3:43:41] <dinnydanny777> We didn't get to pilot an Evangelion to fight Satan
[3:43:42] <+ar4ndomblackguy> yeah that image on the left i need on a tshirt
[3:43:43] <somekindaspy> DLC story continues with going back to Urdak!
[3:43:46] <%Gruhunchously> Was that Pat at the top there?
[3:43:50] <Nested_Dreams> MercyWing1 woolieYE MercyWing2
[3:43:50] <QaizerArt> Who needs a mech when you can kill godzilla size things on your own?
[3:44:02] <%Shishi1205> censored shirts btw
[3:44:11] <%lewdskeletor13> Yeah the DLC description shows a messed up Urdak
[3:44:11] <+Bricespresso> i felt that too i thought the mech wasgonna be in the finale
[3:44:14] <%HitchhikingThrough> SENIOR HR MANAGER: JESSICA HARRIS
[3:44:18] <mdkcde> -5 points it is only a 12/10
[3:44:19] <%Neoepochx> Revelations would be a terrible subtitle
[3:44:23] <mdkcde> dissapointing
[3:44:25] <%HitchhikingThrough> It's deadass Jessica from HR
[3:44:25] <%Neoepochx> Dat Caco hat.
[3:44:25] <somekindaspy> We going back to URDAK in DLC. Full story with new demons and powers!
[3:44:26] <pennykettle_> and how god was almost deleted so you could take a one time portal to hell in 2016
[3:44:26] <+Mkingston> She had a shirt with a puppy in Doomguy armour
[3:44:27] <%Theycallmenerf> Doom: Genesis
[3:44:33] <%lewdskeletor13> Doom: Damnation
[3:44:33] <%Gruhunchously> What's that writer's name again?
[3:44:35] <RunningNGunning> I gotta say woolz, your improvement from the beginning of this LP to now has been HUGE and you going off and improving on your own time is GREATLY appreciated
[3:44:37] <pennykettle_> Karen Tuk?
[3:44:41] <%a_goth_pancake> a_goth_pancake subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Hey Woolz, congrats on killing heaven and and an innocent little boy. Just wanted to say thanks for all the years of joy you've brought me, and I'm glad I can offer a sub as thanks. Stay healthy, catch you in the DLC.
[3:44:45] <RichochetForce> Yeah, first two DLC things are Return to Urdak and an ARC oil rig.
[3:44:48] <$legacy0117> GG Guys. You prevented the SECOND invasion of Earth.
[3:44:49] <+ninjabush> i want to know WHERE THE HELL DID GET THAT RIDE
[3:44:50] <peachy996> Wait EG Daily?
[3:44:52] <CoffeeSlice> Kar En Tuk the children
[3:44:54] <brachydios777> There is cut dialogue you can look up
[3:44:57] <CoffeeSlice> :(
[3:44:57] <+Mkingston> @Gruhunchously William Shakespeare
[3:44:58] <%Neoepochx> "I'll get you next time slayer!"
[3:45:04] <pennykettle_> mick isnt coming back lol
[3:45:09] <peachy996> Why does the name EG Daily sound familiar
[3:45:09] <+rytyoung> Gonna miss him
[3:45:09] <CoffeeSlice> Chad!!!
[3:45:15] <somekindaspy> @pennykettle_ that was half his own fault though. :/
[3:45:17] <%Shishi1205> big misses
[3:45:20] <thatonepassionbentgamer> Pour one out for Mick
[3:45:22] <%Neoepochx> @DelgotHansto I do it to upset you.
[3:45:23] <+zetastriker> The whole promising the OST before it was ready sucked, but it's his fault they didn't fix it
[3:45:25] <kronostorm34> Hulshult Pog
[3:45:27] <%MrRabbles> mick has left after the final battle
[3:45:27] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus now watch that video Mick put out on the metal choir
[3:45:31] <TheHardM> Oh, biggest lore.
[3:45:32] <+zetastriker> Id was okay with him coming back after the fact and adding to the OST
[3:45:35] <pennykettle_> @somekindaspy yep unfortunately
[3:45:36] <%LynbellDaYo> They handled the ending really weird but incredibly good game otherwise
[3:45:38] <RichochetForce> Huge Lore
[3:45:39] <+jiggy_snipe> @peachy996 singer and voice of Tommy Pickles among other characters
[3:45:39] <%DesertPenguin> That Metal Choir video is cool
[3:45:41] <Tha_Mik> Big Lore
[3:45:42] <%a_goth_pancake> MICHAEL
[3:45:46] <%lewdskeletor13> Heavy ass lore
[3:45:46] <f0rgeman> when the shadows first lengthend\
[3:45:46] <ralphfromdk> Lore came aaaaall over the place :D
[3:45:49] <ghostspartan80> soft ending ngl
[3:45:51] <somekindaspy> Lore was HOT
[3:45:54] <f0rgeman> one stood
[3:45:58] <somekindaspy> @ghostspartan80 story dlc keeps it going.
[3:45:59] <peachy996> @jiggy_snipe I think I remember her from Devil's Rejects
[3:46:00] <f0rgeman> he chose the path
[3:46:03] <f0rgeman> of perpetual torment
[3:46:05] <negrosnake9185> Don‚Äôt forget about the upcoming two expansion packs
[3:46:05] <VidulaSaix> That's a funny meme but honestly it would've worn thin very quickly
[3:46:05] <%a_goth_pancake> you killed the biggest demon who ever demon'd
[3:46:06] <Snakes_dk> nah lore though
[3:46:08] <%Gruhunchously> Cooling fans
[3:46:12] <pennykettle_> am I the father tho
[3:46:18] <venomfury86> I don't care what they say, i love this lore!
[3:46:20] <Nomad94> I didn't read any lore
[3:46:21] <somekindaspy> VEGA good boy was God.
[3:46:26] <%DesertPenguin> But also, people wanted a backstory for the guy with no backstory
[3:46:30] <%lewdskeletor13> Doomguy likes comics
[3:46:34] <$legacy0117> No, Vega probably is.
[3:46:36] <%DesertPenguin> Sam is just a retcon, right?
[3:46:42] <f0rgeman> samur hayden
[3:46:42] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:46:45] <Shwepie> Lore is fine, Lore is great, just don't put it between Rip and Tear.
[3:46:46] <+jiggy_snipe> @peachy996 yea she also did alot of live action stuff too
[3:46:46] <%Asuterisuku> Samurl Hayden.
[3:46:48] <%a_goth_pancake> can we get a rip and tear emote?
[3:46:51] <%lewdskeletor13> There‚Äôs an angel named Samael
[3:46:51] <mark_collins45> Sam is the fallen angel.
[3:46:54] <derap41> D E E P L O R E
[3:46:59] <VidulaSaix> Samael as well
[3:47:01] <ghostspartan80> HUGE GUTS is canon so I'm cool with all the lore
[3:47:01] <%Gruhunchously> Mick
[3:47:05] <%DesertPenguin> Exactly
[3:47:05] <gunsrlove> What's with these crazy stretch reaches LUL
[3:47:06] <%DesertPenguin> Retcon
[3:47:07] <+EtheralFlameX> Is doom guy circumcised?
[3:47:07] <Picosunloaded> fallen angel sam boi
[3:47:07] <venomfury86> VEGA IS GOD
[3:47:08] <VidulaSaix> Just a guy LUL
[3:47:10] <dinnydanny777> Some guy
[3:47:11] <pennykettle_> Some random guy that got mercd
[3:47:12] <%LynbellDaYo> one guy
[3:47:12] <%Neoepochx> Samur...Samuel...? HMM
[3:47:12] <lotharrio> The "King Maykr?"
[3:47:13] <%DesertPenguin> It's a retcon?
[3:47:13] <Nomad94> some guy
[3:47:15] <+jiggy_snipe> some dude probably
[3:47:18] <dinnydanny777> His cosplayer
[3:47:19] <pennykettle_> false flag
[3:47:19] <TheHardM> Sam's definitely a squid monster.
[3:47:20] <%BisoromiBear> Luthor
[3:47:20] <peachy996> "Hey random human, say cheese!"
[3:47:21] <Solidnick18> a guy idk
[3:47:21] <+paladinstarbuster> Sam was a dude
[3:47:22] <LeeOhX> Maybe its just a fake painting he made
[3:47:23] <RichochetForce> False flag
[3:47:23] <lotharrio> Just some guy he killed.
[3:47:25] <DeeVee_TV> Some nerd that died, then Samur took his place as a robit?
[3:47:27] <%lewdskeletor13> I think he took over Sam Hayden‚Äôs life
[3:47:27] <mikesapartment> his fleshsom
[3:47:27] <%rosemon5001> @WoolieVersus its his human skin dlc
[3:47:28] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @DelgotHansto
[3:47:28] <$legacy0117> Samur stole him, likely, and went through literal HELL to FREE Doomguy.
[3:47:30] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Did Sam kill that guy and take his cover?
[3:47:31] <pennykettle_> I think the lore is fucked, super retconned I feel
[3:47:32] <brachydios777> That‚Äôs some bullshit
[3:47:34] <+jiggy_snipe> he's like G0T0 Kappa
[3:47:36] <TheHardM> He found a picture on shutterstock and bought it.
[3:47:37] <%HitchhikingThrough> or maybe this game got retconned to shit
[3:47:40] <RichochetForce> It would very easy for a makyr to lie about it
[3:47:40] <%DesertPenguin> he had cancer
[3:47:40] <dinnydanny777> He paid some guy to pretend to be him
[3:47:42] <+TheBigTaco> Wait, did they not pick up on vega being the father?
[3:47:47] <ghostspartan80> sounds like a skull face was in mgs 3 all along kind of retcon
[3:47:51] <somekindaspy> Pretty sure he technologically implanted his consciousness into the guy's head. The guy very suddenly got 4th stage cancer during the construction of the Argent Tower.
[3:47:51] <%LynbellDaYo> They did
[3:47:51] <peachy996> they did
[3:47:52] <dinnydanny777> He wore a skinsuit
[3:47:55] <+paladinstarbuster> they did
[3:47:56] <+Truebluemc> I feel like UAC just made up some shit
[3:48:02] <%lewdskeletor13> Remember the last game said he quickly got brain cancer, I think Samur replaces him then
[3:48:04] <gunsrlove> The guy in the photo is just some guy, nothing was retconned
[3:48:07] <TheHardM> God is the best Windows Assistant.
[3:48:07] <%a_goth_pancake> meat puppet
[3:48:08] <+TheBigTaco> Ah ok
[3:48:08] <derap41> Made god into a battery
[3:48:10] <mark_collins45> or he took a human form couldn't contain his Maykrness
[3:48:10] <dinnydanny777> He stapled the person over himselg
[3:48:14] <Solidnick18> in dlc
[3:48:14] <%Gruhunchously> Vega is God?
[3:48:16] <%Shishi1205> DLC
[3:48:17] <somekindaspy> Story DLC continues the story!
[3:48:17] <RichochetForce> DLC is coming
[3:48:18] <pennykettle_> I really do like the idea that Sam was just a guy with a company trying to save earth and found doomguy when researching hell. but now hell isnt biblical its just aliens
[3:48:21] <Visorak6> DLC
[3:48:21] <TheHardM> Vega is God is Bonzi Buddy
[3:48:22] <TheyCallMeVawn> STORY DLC
[3:48:22] <%Asuterisuku> Your fight is Eternal.
[3:48:24] <VidulaSaix> DLC Tease Jebaited
[3:48:27] <ralphfromdk> It's not to far to think that these aliens that can rebirth them selves and made the slayer immortal could make a human body and put their mind into it. Sam made a human body, fucked of to earth with Vega (father) and then made the robot body later.
[3:48:28] <rytisone> he plays doom and doom 2 in his base in the meanwhile
[3:48:28] <RunningNGunning> We'll find out (hopefully) in DLC
[3:48:28] <%DesertPenguin> Hugo Martin puts mechs in everything he works on. It's his thing
[3:48:31] <%Th3SmartAlec> Retires, lives on a beach, gets another rabbit Kappa
[3:48:37] <RichochetForce> DLC has new weapons, new areas, and apparently new weapons and suit upgrades
[3:48:41] <+OldDarkwraith> There's suppose to be DLC + post credit scene
[3:48:41] <+zetastriker> I think he went straight from Maykr to robot, and faked the human part.
[3:48:42] <%Neoepochx> Arc Complex is godlike
[3:48:42] <derap41> Lot of Ruinied orgasms
[3:48:46] <Tha_Mik> Daisy is irreplacable
[3:48:48] <%DesertPenguin> When is DLC
[3:48:50] <peachy996> Gonna miss Mick
[3:48:50] <%Gruhunchously> Extreme teasing
[3:48:50] <venomfury86> @woolieversus the scientist said Samuel's robot body is "ALL ALIEN"
[3:48:50] <%jinking79> the fact UAC couldn't fix him cause it Alien tech
[3:48:55] <VidulaSaix> JUST LOG IN YOU OLD MAN LUL
[3:48:57] <Ozmodyas> The Artbook seems to imply we‚Äôre going into the Slayerverse

[3:52:32] <%lewdskeletor13> @mark_collins45 This is implied to be a different universe or timeline

[3:52:38] <$legacy0117> Hell has Nine more Circles. That is what is left.
[3:52:38] <lotharrio> Pretty standard for Doom for Earth to get fucked.
[3:52:39] <RichochetForce> Yeah, 95% of people are dead. The planet is half-terraformed and poisonous to humans, the moon is fucked, and cultists might retry

It was great to see you go from a scrublord FPS player to styling out at the end like in Devil May Cry. Any other FPS games you thinking about playing?

[4:11:42] <venomfury86> @shishi1205 thanks
[4:11:44] <%lewdskeletor13> I would‚Äôve been surprised if you guys didn‚Äôt finish this today
[4:11:45] <RichochetForce> Wow
[4:11:54] <Picosunloaded> fallen ange
[4:11:59] <RichochetForce> Vega = God
[4:12:02] <RichochetForce> Sam = Fallen Angel
[4:12:05] <$legacy0117> Mass unemployment? I suppose if that's what you mean. Anyway, see ya dudes, and stop people that throw out lies and slander
[4:12:06] <RichochetForce> Doom guy = ???
[4:12:16] <%BisoromiBear> Doomguy = David
[4:12:16] <%lewdskeletor13> Samael in the Bible is a fallen angel
[4:12:20] <rytisone> a force of nature
[4:12:28] <+Takuatt> Sam=Satan=Lucifer+fallen Angel
[4:12:29] <$legacy0117> Holy Spirit.
[4:12:30] <%Javaa01> Doomslayer got the good blessing
[4:12:37] <+GingerStrawhat> No more Devil Games for Woolie sadly
[4:12:38] <%VidulaSaix> You dont know that Woolie LUL
[4:12:39] <$legacy0117> Doomguy, the Son.
[4:12:40] <brachydios777> Slayer was powerd by an Angel technicaliy
[4:12:46] <%notsafeforpbs> @VidulaSaix No problem I'm just depressed...had some fun with the '16 tons' bit and was desperate to get it noticed
[4:12:53] <RichochetForce> Will Doomguy start a human version of the Night Sentinels?
[4:12:53] <%lewdskeletor13> He‚Äôs closer to a demigod
[4:12:56] <%Klefth> Trinity?
[4:13:01] <%Irridium> Doomslayer is Jacob
[4:13:04] <%VidulaSaix> @notsafeforpbs Aww dont do that man. Put yourself first
[4:13:07] <%ChoculaUltra> STYLE TRIGGER
[4:13:09] <RichochetForce> @lewdskeletor13 Yeah, Khan Maykr calls him a demigod
[4:13:09] <%Shishi1205> DMC5 Quadruple S
[4:13:11] <DelgotHansto> Quadruple S
[4:13:12] <Who_lio42> them blessings that fuckin jacob was wrasslin angels for
[4:13:27] <derap41> They could have done it so you unlocked outfits for it but that would be too cool
[4:13:29] <brachydios777> That‚Äôs True
[4:13:36] <DelgotHansto> Other than that Higher Style means Higher DT gain
[4:13:38] <%lewdskeletor13> Oh shit
[4:13:42] <Snakes_dk> arcade mode should be in eternal
[4:13:42] <shin_marx> free bloodpunch, or free bfg
[4:13:46] <%RioGascar> for dante only, what about nero or V
[4:13:54] <$legacy0117> But yeah, Samur is Samuel the Angel of Death. Closest representation.
[4:13:59] <rytisone> dt on, dt off, dt on, dt off
[4:13:59] <%Shishi1205> V with that would be omega busted
[4:14:00] <%LordDukeFishington> so crucible sword could be free for a few swings if Doom eternal added style meter
[4:14:04] <+EdenOfSecondAccount> Hey yo, it's Eden here. Someone told me you were on the list, I guess they counted RoosterTeeth?
[4:14:09] <brachydios777> Having that in more games would be cool
[4:14:11] <%Shishi1205> Getting SSS for V is super easy
[4:14:14] <%notsafeforpbs> @VidulaSaix thanks
[4:14:20] <RichochetForce> There's a hanging story point from the first game involving the Demonic Crucible.
[4:14:20] <+paladinstarbuster> All the powerups should be a meter you build up for certain actions
[4:14:24] <%Atomik456> i mean high style gives you currency doesn't it?
[4:14:24] <DelgotHansto> Again, keeping triple s gives you so much dt
[4:14:32] <Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus would your style meter go down if damaged? for Doom it sounds impossible to not take damage.
[4:14:40] <RichochetForce> Apparently the Demonic Crucible is going to be used by an ultimate corrupter that destroys all realms.
[4:14:43] <venomfury86> Arcade mode is the reason why i'm coming back to Doom 2016 from time to time
[4:14:50] <%DesertPenguin> It should go down if you lose a full block
[4:14:51] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:14:51] <DatAsuna> I did
[4:15:02] <Second_Omega> Rich Get Richer For High Style ranks
[4:15:10] <RichochetForce> Experimentation and flexibility is not fake replay value.
[4:15:11] <@Solidus_113> you want to S rank all the missions
[4:15:13] <%lewdskeletor13> @richochetforce Where‚Äôd you hear that
[4:15:14] <DatAsuna> Don't need a style meter, but it helps motivate you if you're lazy
[4:15:19] <+Takuatt> Its intrinsic vs extrinsic value
[4:15:21] <Chatterbox1991> wait how am i the hype train conductor?
[4:15:27] <RichochetForce> @lewdskeletor13 Doom 2016, a demonic tree flat out says it.
[4:15:27] <brachydios777> @chatterbox1991 I say gradually goes down instead of a style at a time when damaged
[4:15:27] <%LynbellDaYo> I'll definitely replay to get perfect scores
[4:15:33] <rytisone> dmc5 rating system is all over the place
[4:15:35] <$legacy0117> Later, stay cool.
[4:15:39] <ralphfromdk> Oh man, those olden times where games gave your arbitrary points for stuff that didn't do shit or get kept anywhere
[4:16:15] <%ChoculaUltra> idk this convo reminded me of those passwords for the old megaman and megaman x games.
[4:16:15] <%RioGascar> I do wanna say i still love dmc5, if it wasnt for outer wilds it would have been my game of the year last year
[4:16:19] <RichochetForce> Yeah, you play with cutscene shit. It feels so good.
[4:16:31] <derap41> Like Gunz Arena
[4:16:36] <%RioGascar> Nero is best and fun and amazing
[4:16:45] <+paladinstarbuster> Has reggie never played a DMC game?
[4:16:48] <%LordDukeFishington> So like Titanfall 2 incorporated
[4:16:49] <DelgotHansto> The philosophy of if he does in a cutscene you can do it in game made dmc 3
[4:16:57] <@Solidus_113> Did Woolie see that the next League of Legends champion will have a Style meter?
[4:17:00] <RichochetForce> @DelgotHansto Bingo
[4:17:14] <rytisone> do it for the cheevos
[4:17:21] <%ChoculaUltra> still holding out hope on a DMC5 SE.
[4:17:24] <%Shishi1205> he doesnt know I imagine
[4:17:35] <%a_goth_pancake> for cool points
[4:17:38] <RichochetForce> @ChoculaUltra Never give up hope. DMC4 got one 7 years after the original release.
[4:17:39] <venomfury86> i was happy they got rid of the time ranking
[4:17:48] <%seduwu> Vergil DLC pls
[4:17:55] <%VidulaSaix> I hate that shit

[4:22:13] <DatAsuna> Since antifa isn't an actual group, you can say anybody is part of it
[4:22:15] <%eyezehuhh> but you know
[4:22:17] <Robot_Nixon_> Antifers KKona
[4:22:19] <ashenjuan25> USA: Antifa is a terrorist organization. Antifa: we‚Äôre an organization?

[4:22:22] <%Psitterrific> They fractured his skull

[4:22:29] <derap41> Woolie the Police legally doesn't have to protect and serve

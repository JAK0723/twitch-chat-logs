[0:25:39] <@Menitta> I installed mugen and I kinda wanna try my hand at a character but all I know is Matlab lol
[0:25:39] <%subjectg> Ghetto Warmachine vs Alter Amiba is the best

[0:27:18] <Leafboi125> I like the betting
[0:27:19] <+kamig92> Does it sound like Woolie is redlining at some points?
[0:27:21] <%Superbro64> Reminder that Elecbyte died SO long ago, that the license is now lost, and you're legally obligated to destroy all exes of mugen that you own
[0:27:22] <%Superbro64> good stuff
[0:27:26] <Bruno_Tropical> You get PORN
[0:27:28] <+gustavozxd> first mugen for me was castlevania fighter, I didn't even play fighting games back then

[0:36:57] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Between this and the Hulk doll dayum

[0:37:02] <SableS139a> F-fuck man...
[0:37:02] <iamtheTwitchghost> atpFeelsBeardMan
[0:37:03] <1AbuOmar1> i lost my Dragon Quest 7 save with 60 hours in it to my brother. He did it on purpose but lied.
[0:37:03] <%GrassCannon> the day Woolie became an only child.
[0:37:05] <blackout233692> the pain we've been there woolz
[0:37:08] <HereComestheChief> lytMOTIVATED
[0:37:15] <+gustavozxd> that was the day woolie fought his brother shirtless in the rain
[0:37:22] <SableS139a> The perks of being an only child.
[0:37:24] <princegeo> that changed our man's life
[0:37:26] <taquito_blade> fuck....and setting mugen up properly is hard enough as it is to a non pc plater
[0:37:27] <%Irridium> shoutout to my brother who overwrote my Grandia 2 save when I was right at the end boss
[0:37:28] <%ChoculaUltra> I had a cousin completely destroy my only PS2 memory card when I was halfway through MGS2 for the first time. I still haven't gotten over it. FeelsBadMan
[0:37:29] <taquito_blade> player*
[0:37:31] <Bruno_Tropical> FUCK
[0:37:36] <%LastHazzerd> well... it's a good lesson i guess
[0:37:37] <dapperskeleton69> and thus, Woolie began his journey to where we are now
[0:37:39] <+iamwood99> dmc4_nero_crying.mp4
[0:37:41] <Solidnick18> lesson learned i suppose
[0:37:43] <Megablueflash> @sables139a I actually mained Frieza in Hyper DBZ, all the characters they made just have so much care put into them. And the fact that they're still making them is awesome
[0:37:44] <+paladinstarbuster> FeelsBadMan
[0:37:46] <LocalRobyn> is it just me or are they quiet
[0:37:46] <Dean_Inbetween> I HAVE NO BROTHER- punished woolie
[0:37:49] <Pappajimbo> we all learn the hard way
[0:37:51] <+gustavozxd> I lost my xenoblade X 100+ hour save file once
[0:37:56] <Ciriliko> Selling your games DansGame
[0:38:02] <+tinyswampthing> my best friends brother sold his ps3 and all his games for cigarettes
[0:38:08] <coladscorpion> Woolie combed his hair backwards in the rain... and pulled his hulk doll out... the beat down would be glorious
[0:38:12] <@Menitta> I wish I kept Arms
[0:38:14] <iamtheTwitchghost> true

[0:47:35] <%SilvaChariot0133> IQS Meltys monkaS
[0:47:35] <Dean_Inbetween> Dong dong is too high quality for mugen I say that with no sarcasm LUL
[0:47:37] <TheGershon> anime voices and all that
[0:47:38] <+gustavozxd> @KingOfIronFisting there's a decent street fighter versus DCU in mugen
[0:47:38] <Megablueflash> There was also a Luigi. Which is just the same Mario except taller with a different voice
[0:47:45] <%FuqBoiSlim> yo that hyper dragon ball fighter was sick as hell. Golden Freiza was the final boss and the arcade mode had co-op so you could 2v2 it
[0:47:46] <TheactualDiepod> Fullgames are great or have potential, HDBZ is the only one I know of to not be compiling tho

[0:48:05] <Infeirno23> dong dong is in saltybet
[0:48:12] <%ChoculaUltra> Warusaki3 is the goat of JoJo Mugen characters.
[0:48:13] <%SilvaChariot0133> Always bet Dong Dong
[0:48:15] <%CaptainPileDriver> but for real could we get a bit of an increase in volume on your end, like a little smidge up
[0:48:22] <Dcrapman77> So its pronounced mewgin?
[0:48:26] <lazerscraper> @thesaltminer Arm Joe was a fighter maker game i think
[0:48:29] <%LastHazzerd> it really depends on what the other characters can do
[0:48:30] <ChrisM341> Dong Dong never bet on Naruto
[0:48:33] <%ggbhtg> MUU Ginn

[0:51:07] <%ChoculaUltra> Nidhogg is truly a game that tests your fighting game prowess. And how loud you can yell profanities.
[0:51:11] <SunxAngel> Oh?
[0:51:19] <%illtima> makes sense
[0:51:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> nidhogg is a game that can truly last for hours
[0:51:25] <shinichizio> I respect whoever makes the 'Regular Ass [Character]' characters. In a world with Rare Akumas and Orochi Geese, seeing Regular Ass Iori beat someone with sheer aggression is great.

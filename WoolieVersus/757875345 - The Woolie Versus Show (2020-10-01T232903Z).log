[0:27:03] <neroblind88> capcom mid 90s was a wild time
[0:27:13] <+jiggy_snipe> Capcom was making so many fighting games
[0:27:13] <Kolpax619> don't forget Street Fighter: The Movie: The Game!
[0:27:13] <neroblind88> Cyberbots in 97
[0:27:17] <%zanzibar_junker> OPTIC BLAST
[0:27:17] <%McGwinnus> truth
[0:27:23] <Skatedeandre> Hey 1996 I was 0
[0:27:23] <SomersaultJustice> REAL BATTLE ON FILM
[0:27:24] <%ChoculaUltra> Capcom was really on some shit.
[0:27:31] <+chosenjuan42> Has Woolie reacted to Steve in Smash today?
[0:27:35] <%ChoculaUltra> They had a new game out like every 2 or 3 months within a span of a decade plus.
[0:27:35] <+Superbro64> I hope the capcom devs of yesteryear werent crunched too hard :/
[0:27:41] <Solidnick18> it's crazy to think about tbh
[0:27:44] <+NecDW4> Cactus Jack Sent Me
[0:27:46] <%LCLSmoothie> wish i was alive during the 90s to see peak capcom
[0:27:49] <Karl_oj> 1992 shut out to Alien 3 !
[0:27:50] <%emperordread> Is this the game where GRAVITY SQUEEZE came from?
[0:28:00] <%ChoculaUltra> Megaman X games, MMBN games, fighting games, REs.
[0:28:07] <neroblind88> @Superbro64 they probably wre tbh
[0:28:15] <+Superbro64> @neroblind88 :/
[0:28:20] <+jiggy_snipe> it's the Capcom is dead era
[0:28:25] <+Superbro64> like a lot of capcom devs left I think
[0:28:26] <$SWFanatic> masters of teras kasi HOAR WINS
[0:28:26] <%FuqBoiSlim> I dont want to be one of those "I was born in the wrong generations" type zoomers but I wish I was around when arcades were big
[0:28:26] <%zanzibar_junker> Jim Lee X-Men were an international cultural hit
[0:28:28] <+Superbro64> NeoG and others
[0:28:30] <Skatedeandre> I was lucky I got to see the mid 90s capcom way after the fact
[0:28:33] <SomersaultJustice> dead like darkstalkers
[0:28:35] <neroblind88> Cvs2 was the peak of capcom fighting games of the old era
[0:28:44] <alephalpha> a bunch of anime fighters came out then right
[0:28:46] <alephalpha> ?
[0:28:47] <TungstenViper> that was the "America loves edgy 3D fighters" era
[0:28:48] <%ChoculaUltra> CvsS2 was the send off imo.

[0:29:24] <+NecDW4> @WoolieVersus Man, i was at Galloping Ghost for my B-day a couple weeks ago, and saw this there. Sadly i didnt get a chance to poke at it, GG XX A was more important, so im looking forward to seeing it here
[0:29:49] <Kei_Ar_> Fughtcade 2?
[0:29:50] <Shardlab> X-men's Japanese intro was very much in tune with this game
[0:29:54] <eddie_hedgehog> fightcade 1 or 2?
[0:29:55] <+jiggy_snipe> @Superbro64 I think they had a couple of licensed games and they were releasing updates to Gulity Gear XX

[0:30:15] <alephalpha> all the fucking air mobilit in dark styalkers
[0:30:27] <alephalpha> tbf GGXX IS THE FUCKING SHIT
[0:30:34] <Shardlab> This was like Joe Mad and all those 90's artists just injected up in this
[0:31:03] <+NecDW4> It was weird playing GGXX, because i tried Baiken... only i only knew her REV2 moves... so it did NOT go great for a while
[0:31:23] <eddie_hedgehog> dont talk about Storm pls
[0:31:23] <%ChoculaUltra> Ice Man had Arctic Attack and only Arctic Attack cota onwards LUL
[0:31:29] <%FuqBoiSlim> O P T I C B L A S T
[0:31:33] <TungstenViper> Those were the MUGEN is cool years LUL
[0:31:34] <+nightwing1936> Storm still has an OP Super with the Start button in this game
[0:31:36] <+chosenjuan42> Woolie and his Cross Men?
[0:31:41] <Shardlab> Storm became the Omega class mutant we knew she could be
[0:31:44] <Ipsenscastle> Behold! Optic Blast!
[0:31:46] <+NecDW4> didn't know i had to do motions off block for her counters instead of holding butons for a stance, then a riposte
[0:31:49] <eddie_hedgehog> are u using fightcade 1 or 2?
[0:31:56] <@Solidus_113> 2

[0:32:27] <KnivesEve> more minecraft story mode!?
[0:32:34] <Ipsenscastle> out of interest, what made you start the minecraft story mode lp in the first place?
[0:32:35] <%ChoculaUltra> wasn't Akuma a secret character in CotA too? Or am I going senile?
[0:32:39] <tearfuldevil> minecraft story mode sucks, but they were also going in big boomer energy
[0:32:41] <%Solidnick18> woolieKICKDAD woolieKICKDAD
[0:32:43] <Skatedeandre> Think they using parsec unless it’s in fightcade
[0:32:45] <RoboticRexkek> you can hate on steve, but the effort they did to incorporate minecraft's mechanics into smash is quite awesome.
[0:32:46] <joshua_42> akuma was a secret character
[0:32:54] <%RyTYoung> @tearfuldevil big sleepy boomer mode
[0:32:54] <TungstenViper> Xmen! Welcome... TO DIE!!!"

[0:33:25] <Skatedeandre> I’m salty about Steve but I’m a dumb kh fan with too much hope in his heart
[0:33:27] <+chosenjuan42> Gamer Cube Kirby
[0:33:27] <+jiggy_snipe> @RoboticRexkek they had change all the changes to incorporate him. I feel bad for Sakurai cuz he works so hard
[0:33:34] <@Solidus_113> If kirby is square he is no longer shaped like a friend
[0:33:35] <%ChoculaUltra> oh my god thats right, Akuma had that infinite jab mash off of his HK/HP throw LUL
[0:33:46] <Skatedeandre> That square Kirby is apparently from a wii u mod
[0:33:49] <plushysceptile> So does this mean Woolie is going to pick <REDACTED> for lore in CotA?
[0:33:50] <21uzisaiyan> All I need is Sora for Smash
[0:33:54] <eddie_hedgehog> nice
[0:33:56] <%RyTYoung> Sakurai was not happy about the choice of Steve being in smash

[1:00:37] <$arcielardor> they got a code unlock for the bosses?
[1:00:37] <%FuqBoiSlim> @newdonkking He gave out 2 steam keys for it at the start we woke
[1:00:40] <%kyh9> The 90s Japanese Fighting Game ost is really sending me for a loop

[1:02:20] <alejandrogccs> @KaiserMario he was a boss in X-Men Legends 2

[1:02:29] <%uhgoat> let's go cyclops
[1:02:34] <Pappajimbo> and now hes cuck man
[1:02:35] <Meltgar> Man, i miss sentinel
[1:02:37] <MonsieurHonHon> Yo fuck cyclops tho
[1:02:38] <@Commando_Joe> Cyclops also kills Professor X
[1:02:42] <@Commando_Joe> and becomes the new Magneto
[1:02:44] <Applecannon63> Huge douche but rip va
[1:02:45] <%kyh9> Avengers vs Xmen was so bad, it was so shitty
[1:02:45] <+Tarkus110> and cyclops is still wrong through all he does
[1:02:45] <Shardlab> The best Cyclops power: A jetpack
[1:02:50] <prime_name> Cyclops gets turned into a skullgun in the zombies run.
[1:02:51] <Shardlab> Flyclops!
[1:02:52] <%spookler> He goes through Psylocke doesn't he?
[1:02:52] <stayinthepocket> Cyclops did nothing wrong.
[1:02:55] <tearfuldevil> cyclops is kind of a douche but lets be hoenst wolverine is jsut a fucking asshole
[1:02:57] <KSDM> DREAMS DON'T DIE
[1:02:58] <trickquestionz> Cyclops' death cry should just be him screaming out Jeans name
[1:02:58] <+sinistersally> yeah he went through Jean, Psylock, Emma Fronst...
[1:02:59] <chll0ne> cyclops was right
[1:02:59] <MonsieurHonHon> Cyclops is the origin of like 50% of all of xmen probalems
[1:03:00] <%kyh9> He's pretty good in the old Claremont stuff and even in Dark Reign
[1:03:06] <%FuqBoiSlim> Rightclops went through a lot
[1:03:14] <theCoolChild> Don't forget when Past Cyclops basically said his older self was NOT IT
[1:03:15] <tearfuldevil> and like, wolverine refuses to show any itnerest in ladies whoa ren't in relaitonships
[1:03:16] <@Commando_Joe> he also fucks Emma Frost on Jean's grave
[1:03:22] <Meltgar> Cyclops didn't hat the EYES on the price Kappa
[1:03:25] <tearfuldevil> he is only into it if hes cucking someone
[1:03:26] <neroblind88> cyclops and emma is the otp
[1:03:30] <chll0ne> god the fox movies really ruined public perception of cyc
[1:03:31] <coreybom> @pappajimbo Hey, dude getting some serious ass though.
[1:03:36] <trickquestionz> Cyclops is a deadbeat father
[1:03:39] <MonsieurHonHon> Wolverine might be an asshole but at least hes heroic and not just a chaotic neutral fuck
[1:03:40] <neroblind88> @chll0ne true
[1:03:41] <%Covetous_Cat> "I thought it was safe" describes every decision I make in fighting games ;-;
[1:03:43] <%kyh9> Scott is hard to get right, people like Wolverine so much and usually at the expense of Scott
[1:03:45] <%kyh9> Lmao
[1:03:47] <Shardlab> Jean's body wasn't even cold
[1:03:48] <Ipsenscastle> I always liked when Cyclops went toe to toe with Wolvie in the Proteus storyline for no fucking reason
[1:03:52] <Applecannon63> Rip in piece Cyclop's VA
[1:03:55] <%FuqBoiSlim> WHATS WITH ALL THIS CYKE SLANDER IN CHAT??? I DONT LIKE THIS
[1:03:57] <prime_name> They did it on the grave
[1:04:00] <coreybom> @commando_joe In fairness, jean kinda forced him too.
[1:04:00] <willg1222> dont forget Madelyn Pryor
[1:04:05] <%LCLSmoothie> reminder: cyclops eyes are portals from the punch dimension
[1:04:07] <MonsieurHonHon> YO FUCK CYCLOPS, HE A BITCH
[1:04:10] <%uhgoat> whedon's astonishing run made me love cyclops since then
[1:04:14] <%Covetous_Cat> Imagine liking cyclops?
[1:04:14] <+jiggy_snipe> Cyclops is a bad person, don't defend him
[1:04:19] <+Tarkus110> cyke is a menace
[1:04:19] <tearfuldevil> the movies and to soem extent the t show kind of shit on Scott for Logans sake
[1:04:19] <@Commando_Joe> Also Hope Summers is the fucking worst
[1:04:21] <%kyh9> @MonsieurHonHon You take that back
[1:04:21] <MonsieurHonHon> He cheated on a psychich with another psychic, fucking dumbass
[1:04:24] <neroblind88> cyclops is great
[1:04:26] <stayinthepocket> Wolvie was only good in X2 and Logan
[1:04:26] <chll0ne> no
[1:04:30] <chll0ne> cyclops is great!
[1:04:32] <Shardlab> Cyke has a tatsu
[1:04:37] <MonsieurHonHon> He dumb, his power is dumb and youre dumb for liking this dude
[1:04:39] <SomersaultJustice> all my homies hate cyclops
[1:04:40] <Meltgar> Huh, any other X-MEN that never got the chance to shine? Or be "Good" design and story wise?
[1:04:40] <%kyh9> Scott's not a good person but he's a pretty good character
[1:04:41] <theCoolChild> Isn't Cyc, Jean and Wolvie like in a throuple at some point?
[1:04:47] <coreybom> @jiggy_snipe Lets be real, alot of the x-men are kinda fucked.
[1:04:47] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:04:48] <+cleese> Yo why does wolverine have big floppy batmen ears on his knees
[1:04:49] <%kyh9> @MonsieurHonHon That's all the Xmen tho
[1:04:50] <Applecannon63> Cylclops more like Cycuck
[1:04:55] <+jiggy_snipe> @coreybom true
[1:04:57] <%kyh9> @MonsieurHonHon Mutants are just a grab-bag of super powers
[1:04:59] <neroblind88> @theCoolChild in the current run lol
[1:05:00] <KaiserMario> Dat ass
[1:05:03] <%unclekulikov> BIRBS
[1:05:04] <chll0ne> @cleese the 90s
[1:05:08] <trickquestionz> Cyclops fucked a random woman because she looked exactly like Jean and abandoned both her and their child when Jean came back to life.
[1:05:16] <Meltgar> WOW
[1:05:24] <KaiserMario> poor Mag
[1:05:32] <%FuqBoiSlim> Okay, maybe Scott deserves some slander
[1:05:38] <neroblind88> no slander
[1:05:40] <KaiserMario> wasn't she a clone created by Mr Sinister?
[1:05:41] <%FuqBoiSlim> HOWEVER
[1:05:50] <neroblind88> @KaiserMario yep
[1:05:50] <trickquestionz> It's not slander if it's true
[1:05:53] <MonsieurHonHon> Thats fair @kyh9 about him being a bad person but good character, like he gets drama going. Still hes a douche nozzle and if he trip and falls and does a nightwing id be fine with it
[1:05:54] <Ipsenscastle> @trickquestionz in his defence she was a clone made to fuck with him and she became the queen of goblins
[1:06:02] <+jiggy_snipe> yea I think it was part of some weird plan
[1:06:02] <Meltgar> In this stream we hate cyclops Kappa
[1:06:03] <neroblind88> i love this stage
[1:06:08] <357Sneak> aimasaWhoamy
[1:06:16] <TheactualDiepod> Best theme in the game
[1:06:17] <coreybom> @trickquestionz slim didn’t abandon her actually. he went right back to her, but she was just gone.
[1:06:27] <+Tarkus110> not just this stream. all streams we hate on cyke
[1:06:27] <neroblind88> its like a tekken stage before tekken
[1:06:34] <MonsieurHonHon> If you like cyclop dont bother watching Kappa
[1:06:37] <%kyh9> @MonsieurHonHon Well these days, he's one of the generals for Krakoa and he's living domestically with Jean, Logan and his kids on the moon
[1:06:41] <chll0ne> comics are weird
[1:06:53] <+Xero_J> I keep trying to find a comic basis for this stage, but never find any hits on wikis
[1:06:54] <KaiserMario> Mr Sinister is underused, he was really fun villain
[1:06:55] <neroblind88> PogChamp
[1:06:56] <MonsieurHonHon> @kyh9 I hate everything about what you just said
[1:06:56] <alejandrogccs> FYI you dont need to reset after every match if you're using FBNeo, just create a save state on character select and load it later
[1:06:59] <willg1222> also to be fair, wasnt the child sent into the future and became Cable?
[1:07:01] <DeadlyRaveNeo> can i fight you im on fightcade right now
[1:07:02] <neroblind88> @chll0ne very weird
[1:07:07] <%kyh9> @MonsieurHonHon No, really. He's just chilling on the moon with his family + Logan on the moon most of the time when he's not helping the Mutant Nation of Krakoa
[1:07:09] <%kyh9> @MonsieurHonHon Lmao
[1:07:11] <trickquestionz> Remember when his bad was a space pirate who also abandoned his children?
[1:07:15] <trickquestionz> dad*
[1:07:20] <%kyh9> HiX-men is pretty fun, even if it's weird as fuck
[1:07:23] <ThatGuyThere03> yooooooooooo that's actually a sick way of doing invisiblity in a fighter
[1:07:23] <coreybom> @chll0ne But fucking awesome.
[1:07:24] <+jiggy_snipe> it runs in the family Kappa
[1:07:29] <MonsieurHonHon> @kyh9 What the fuck do you mean chilling on the moon
[1:07:33] <MonsieurHonHon> Like what
[1:07:34] <%FuqBoiSlim> I dont even read comics that much man my like for cyclops just come from x-men evolution and the movies NotLikeThis
[1:07:36] <chll0ne> somehow the fate series is way more confusing
[1:07:42] <+Xero_J> So, Cable is the future son of the CLONE of Jean Grey and Cyclops?
[1:07:47] <MonsieurHonHon> hes a duck in the movies too
[1:07:47] <willg1222> yes
[1:07:53] <chll0ne> x-men evolution is peak 2000s culture n i love it
[1:07:54] <%FuqBoiSlim> but the eye lasers
[1:07:57] <neroblind88> @FuqBoiSlim evolution is based
[1:08:05] <%Solidnick18> sounds hot

[1:08:12] <MonsieurHonHon> The eye lasers looked cool n the movie tbf
[1:08:14] <+GenesisKnight> She got stuck in an Assassin's body
[1:08:19] <Shardlab> @trickquestionz They killed his wife after transporting them off the plane. His boys were still in a crashing plane. So yeah, Corsair thought they were dead
[1:08:19] <eldercat> They're seperated now.
[1:08:20] <+sinistersally> Revanche was asian?
[1:08:21] <huskarl_zap> British nanny Kreygasm
[1:08:24] <chll0ne> psylocke Kreygasm
[1:08:25] <coreybom> @fuqboislim Comic slim is a great character, but he gets fucked alot.
[1:08:28] <JdotSweapA> X
[1:08:29] <theCoolChild> and her OG body is like dead now right?
[1:08:31] <ThatGuyThere03> is there a reason Ice Man is so tiny in comparison?
[1:08:31] <+jiggy_snipe> yea I think she's Japanese
[1:08:40] <%FuqBoiSlim> You're telling me Psylocke was Asian Get Out??
[1:08:41] <%Covetous_Cat> Ice Man made this stage and now the water is too cold for everyone to enjoy their beach day
[1:08:51] <+Tarkus110> yup she was
[1:08:51] <+GenesisKnight> @theCoolChild The other chick is still using it I think
[1:08:56] <fifthkeeg> BRO u guys already talk about threeway cyclops amd wolverine and jean grey are having in the comics?
[1:09:01] <%uhgoat> exactly what she was
[1:09:02] <trickquestionz> It's like how Rouge's origin story involved putting Mrs. Marvel in coma for a decade.
[1:09:03] <+sinistersally> OMG
[1:09:05] <MonsieurHonHon> Who would win, Capcom's psylocke's ass or rogue's ass in that one scene of the 90s cartoon
[1:09:07] <chll0ne> @fifthkeeg yes
[1:09:07] <Applecannon63> remember Jean was so white to Gambit for wanting to add spice on her cooking?
[1:09:08] <%Solidnick18> oh boy
[1:09:13] <MonsieurHonHon> you know the one
[1:09:25] <Dementedpenguin> Her portrait when she gets hurt LUL
[1:09:30] <%uhgoat> psylocke free
[1:09:32] <+Tarkus110> damn...id say psylocke
[1:09:33] <+Xero_J> Capcom knows how to make a fine ass
[1:09:34] <%Solidnick18> get him cool man
[1:09:38] <fifthkeeg> hot
[1:09:40] <trickquestionz> Which is somehow still not the worse thing to happen to Mrs. Marvel in that decade.
[1:09:48] <%Solidnick18> NOOO
[1:09:50] <coreybom> @fuqboislim Yep, ol girl was pretty much that. Shes back to being british, but for a long time she was in the asian body.
[1:09:50] <chll0ne> gambits from new orleans u know he needs some seasoning in his food
[1:09:51] <%kyh9> @MonsieurHonHon I mean he has a house on the moon. But don't worry, there's a teleportation plant that lets him go back to Krakoa on Earth
[1:09:58] <Shardlab> Revel in your mutant gifts
[1:10:01] <%kyh9> Krakoa Xmen is actually pretty wild
[1:10:02] <357Sneak> dnoGREEN
[1:10:04] <KaiserMario> She was the worst possible way to make a boring character interesting, original Psylock sucked
[1:10:04] <%Covetous_Cat> Rip Mr. Freeze BibleThump
[1:10:05] <%spookler> Dolphin advantage
[1:10:07] <%SilverDevilfish> Iceman's face hahaha
[1:10:12] <chll0ne> also house of x n powers of x were the best the xmen have been in years
[1:10:14] <%kyh9> Like Apocalypse is now a sage/elder who is advising Mutant Kind on how to become immortal
[1:10:23] <Shardlab> Hey look, it's a walking hate crime
[1:10:26] <ThatGuyThere03> PUT ME IN COACH
[1:10:27] <Applecannon63> and Jean just threw the pot of hot water Gambit
[1:10:29] <MonsieurHonHon> Oh yea while weer hating xmen, Iceman a bitch and hes annoying, the shinji of marvel
[1:10:33] <%kyh9> @chll0ne I looked into your eyes and knew you were my brother
[1:10:33] <+jiggy_snipe> Sentinel LUL
[1:10:36] <%Reverend_Roscoe> I only see 4 people in fightcade
[1:10:40] <Pappajimbo> Fun Fact: Iceman if reversing entropy making him one of the most powerful beings on earth
[1:10:41] <%Reverend_Roscoe> what's up with that?
[1:10:51] <+Tarkus110> ifcMango ifcMango
[1:10:56] <MonsieurHonHon> If you told me Iceman masturbated on a unconscious rogue id believe you without a doubr
[1:11:01] <Applecannon63> didn't Iceman cucked Thing's wife?
[1:11:03] <Shardlab> Ice Master
[1:11:07] <trickquestionz> Somehow people still hate slightly ugly British people that look like frogs more than the giant robots that regularly knock over buildings and step on houses.
[1:11:15] <coreybom> @monsieurhonhon Okay sir you need to watch your mouth. Don’t you DARE insult bobby.
[1:11:24] <chll0ne> kolYO1 kolYO2
[1:11:24] <+jiggy_snipe> he's dumb so he didn't realize how powerful he is
[1:11:27] <%kyh9> @MonsieurHonHon Iceman is fucking Emma Frost's brother rn in the comics
[1:11:35] <chll0ne> iceman is OP
[1:11:38] <%FuqBoiSlim> Ol' Benny boy couldn't handle Bobby's wave
[1:11:44] <MonsieurHonHon> Yea we dont want him to cry again, hes already cried twice today :(
[1:11:44] <%kyh9> He's also a pirate who helps Kitty and Bishop take down other pirates
[1:11:46] <chll0ne> hes just too dumb to use his powers
[1:11:50] <chll0ne> like okyasu
[1:11:51] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:12:01] <coreybom> @applecannon63 No that was johnny. And its not really cucked, more he IMMEDIATELY started dating her.
[1:12:13] <+sinistersally> black panther popped her cherry when they were 11
[1:12:16] <Applecannon63> really?
[1:12:18] <%kyh9> @chll0ne There's that time when Emma Frost controlled Bobby's body and was doing shit with his powers that he had never thought of
[1:12:19] <MonsieurHonHon> lolwat
[1:12:22] <+jiggy_snipe> what
[1:12:24] <eddie_hedgehog> bro psylocke is a range character
[1:12:25] <%FuqBoiSlim> @sinistersally ayo???
[1:12:28] <trickquestionz> Like realistically the Sentinel Program would be the biggest breakthrough ever for the mutant rights movement: People would freak the fuck out about these walking hate crimes smashing people's cars while fighting downtown.
[1:12:40] <theCoolChild> Okay Chat here's a question, before Angel became Archangel did his powers matter? Like he could Fly and that's it?
[1:12:43] <KaiserMario> Storm, AKA the ganguro inspiration
[1:12:45] <Ipsenscastle> try the secret characters
[1:12:46] <chll0ne> facts
[1:12:47] <+sinistersally> yep, it was in a back story of how they meet as kids
[1:12:49] <MonsieurHonHon> He had wings dude
[1:12:51] <%kyh9> @trickquestionz Well in Days of future Past, all the people who stand up to them just get killed
[1:12:54] <Ipsenscastle> Juggernaut
[1:12:54] <%JuliusGemstone> FFFFFIGHT
[1:12:54] <+jiggy_snipe> yea he had wings
[1:13:02] <MonsieurHonHon> and did angel fuck while his whole family was watching
[1:13:06] <trickquestionz> All four of the X-Men kinda sucked in the beginning.
[1:13:07] <MonsieurHonHon> like he was midair or soemthing
[1:13:08] <chll0ne> @kyh9 havent read about thta LUL
[1:13:17] <chll0ne> not surprised tho
[1:13:18] <AnAnonymousGifter> An anonymous user is gifting 5 Tier 1 Subs to WoolieVersus's community! 
[1:13:19] <%kyh9> @theCoolChild They did matter because he was still able to fight and he was able to act like crowd control and distraction since he was fast as fuck
[1:13:19] <AnAnonymousGifter> An anonymous user gifted a Tier 1 sub to VantaXIV!  
[1:13:19] <AnAnonymousGifter> An anonymous user gifted a Tier 1 sub to QueenOfSpoopy!

[1:13:20] <AnAnonymousGifter> An anonymous user gifted a Tier 1 sub to TalisKanju!  
[1:13:22] <neroblind88> @KaiserMario i love and hate the fact that she created the japanese love of making "not" black characters
[1:13:22] <stayinthepocket> Why are the X-Men movies bad? I haven't watched since the train wreck that was 3.
[1:13:23] <Applecannon63> Wolverine deserved better
[1:13:30] <+sinistersally> @MonsieurHonHon yeah, it was raining clothe and spooge
[1:13:37] <KaiserMario> LUL
[1:13:39] <MonsieurHonHon> Yea what the fuck was up with that
[1:13:39] <brunoberserk> OH TYPHOOOOON
[1:13:40] <+jiggy_snipe> the people who make them don't care enough
[1:13:45] <trickquestionz> Beast was originally just kinda ugly and lumpy looking instead of blue
[1:13:50] <chll0ne> @stayinthepocket made by ppl who dont read the comics
[1:13:52] <%kyh9> @chll0ne Yeah, it was at some poitn in All New Xmen by Morrison or some shit
[1:14:10] <coreybom> @stayinthepocket They’re not “bad”, more somewhat dated in terms of superhero films.
[1:14:16] <theCoolChild> idk I just always felt like Angel was intended to get his metal wings from the jump
[1:14:18] <Shardlab> Kinda funny. Wolverine knew he could kill everyone on the X-men team and then assessed Storm. She threw up big fat NOPE signals when he thought of every tactic to fight her.
[1:14:25] <%kyh9> @trickquestionz OG Beast was just some guy who had big feet and was strong. And then they realized monster comics were sort of popular in the 60s so they made him a mosnter man
[1:14:30] <coreybom> @stayinthepocket I mean 3 sucks though, no doubt.
[1:14:30] <chll0ne> @kyh9 was it morrison or bendis. cus i wasnt about to read xmen by bendis
[1:14:44] <Applecannon63> a hot blue monsterman
[1:14:53] <%kyh9> @chll0ne I wish I could tell you. I'm doing my big re-readthrough rn and I'm still in the Claremont era
[1:14:53] <neroblind88> @KaiserMario Vanessa Williams..... why does she have white hair WeirdChamp
[1:14:57] <MonsieurHonHon> My dad got the xmen essentials and man, old comics arent very good
[1:15:13] <+Xero_J> Was Dark Phoenix any good?
[1:15:15] <chll0ne> probably new xmen by morrison then
[1:15:18] <Applecannon63> lighting hair?
[1:15:19] <+Xero_J> The movie I mean
[1:15:27] <+LaNoktaTempesto> hey look, it's Buff Captain Planet fighting Storm!
[1:15:37] <alephalpha> WUT
[1:15:40] <+sinistersally> @Xero_J movie no, comic yes
[1:15:40] <+JustToWatch> REALLY?
[1:15:40] <MonsieurHonHon> Fireball START?
[1:15:42] <MafiaTweek> whatt
[1:15:48] <KSDM> AHAHAGA
[1:15:49] <coreybom> @monsieurhonhon Pre claremont era xmen were pretty lame. Hell, they were about to be cancelled until he came along.
[1:15:51] <Dementedpenguin> @MonsieurHonHon I read the original X-Men run.... it was super boring after the first few issues. LUL
[1:15:58] <trickquestionz> In the very original X-Men comics the only one who was really cool power wise was Quicksilver. Magneto didn't hard counter half the team, Scarlet Witch produced moderate bad luck and Toad could jump.
[1:16:01] <+JustToWatch> that's fucking cursed
[1:16:04] <%spookler> sbfpSetIn
[1:16:09] <sugewin> WOOLIE
[1:16:12] <+jiggy_snipe> Colossus outfit is really dumb when you think about it
[1:16:13] <Applecannon63> What about Jubilee?
[1:16:22] <MonsieurHonHon> his arms are so lanky
[1:16:28] <%kyh9> @MonsieurHonHon Yeah, the old Lee/Thomas runs aren't that great. But the Claremont stuff really picks up
[1:16:35] <neroblind88> Fireworks !
[1:16:36] <UltimateDomon> His tits are huge
[1:16:43] <+GalacticaPhanto> @jiggy_snipe Not really, hes just trying to show who's the boss of this gym
[1:16:44] <MonsieurHonHon> I havent gotten really far in the comics tbh
[1:16:45] <%kyh9> Like, Xmen had their own Jojo arc after they run into Magneto for the first time in the Claremont era
[1:16:50] <neroblind88> @UltimateDomon bara tits
[1:16:51] <%FuqBoiSlim> having the start button used for a super sounds like a meme made by someone who's trash at FG's and blames motions for it
[1:16:54] <Shardlab> Jubilee worked her powers up to the point that she could oneshot a Sentinel
[1:16:55] <Ipsenscastle> The Claremont stuff pick up the EXACT MOMENT John Byrne came aboard
[1:16:59] <%kyh9> She's so jiggly
[1:17:07] <KaiserMario> I forgot Abigail... I mean, Juggernaut wasn't in this game
[1:17:25] <coreybom> Claremont and byrne essentially SAVED the x-men.
[1:17:29] <%kyh9> Bobby can be dangerous, he has a great moment in the current Marauders run where he goes full Serial Killer mode
[1:17:30] <+Xero_J> Juggernaut's a secret char here, right?
[1:17:37] <%kyh9> Doesn't kill anyone but scares the shit out of some people
[1:17:45] <Dementedpenguin> Adams' run at the end of the original run was pretty to look at though
[1:17:48] <%RyTYoung> RyTYoung subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! Hey Woolie and Reggie! Last week my preorder for the PS5 was declined due to them running out, but I'm in the queue if they can get more, but in the meantime I have taken your advice from the podcast Woolie and started using a stock checker so thank you!
[1:17:49] <DDDorsett> Juggernaut's the guy you fight before Magneto
[1:17:50] <+sinistersally> Iceman can move heat around, he could actually be sun man but he's too stupid
[1:17:51] <Shardlab> @KaiserMario Juggs is in this. He's a sub-boss who beats you with a girder
[1:17:55] <Applecannon63> He's an Okayasu?
[1:18:02] <DrJamesWoods> yes
[1:18:07] <+jiggy_snipe> Omega Level Mutant
[1:18:07] <KaiserMario> yeah, I forgot that he was a secret char
[1:18:10] <+sinistersally> @Applecannon63 exactly
[1:18:11] <CalderGaming> MAXWELL'S DAEMON
[1:18:12] <+jiggy_snipe> if he knew
[1:18:13] <+Triforce505> specifically, the manipulation of water temperature
[1:18:13] <MonsieurHonHon> Preach
[1:18:16] <Equirah> LUL
[1:18:17] <%Solidnick18> Oh wow
[1:18:19] <MonsieurHonHon> WOOLIE IS SPITTING

[1:18:27] <alephalpha> ahhh okuyasu
[1:18:31] <trickquestionz> LEARN YOUR PHYSICS
[1:18:35] <+Xero_J> So, technically speaking, he could manipulate EVERYTHING
[1:18:36] <%Solidnick18> ice cube head
[1:18:36] <MonsieurHonHon> Bobby? more like dummy
[1:18:39] <Shardlab> It took years for Ice Man to realize how broken he is and use it
[1:18:40] <+michingmallecho> I google “worst X-men writer” and the first result CHUCK AUSTEN. and now I’m remembering Iceman and mystique romance
[1:18:45] <%FuqBoiSlim> Bobby Nijimura LUL
[1:18:45] <Daxalog> To be fair would you know how to do that?
[1:18:46] <%Solidnick18> Icemannnn
[1:18:48] <Pappajimbo> he could insta kill most villans
[1:18:48] <%xiccy> xiccy subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 2 months, let's keep the rhythm up.! If I drop this motherfucker it would not be cool!
[1:18:53] <Shardlab> Hell, you can't kill Bobby now
[1:18:54] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1310937719246385153?s=19
[1:18:59] <+sinistersally> Iceman: explain to me better, I'm stupid remember
[1:19:00] <coreybom> @michingmallecho OH FUCK CHUCK.
[1:19:02] <Hammatime8> Motherfucker builds HIS OWN NAME out of ice and fucking LEANS ON IT
[1:19:11] <Shardlab> If he's in ice form, Bobby can't die
[1:19:15] <Ipsenscastle> Someone beat them up as Juggernaut please
[1:19:19] <trickquestionz> Chuck Austen tried to make Nightcrawler the Pope with murder communion cookies to prop of The Church of Racism.
[1:19:40] <eldercat> Yeah
[1:19:44] <DrJamesWoods> Hawkeye will turn out to be a God of Aim
[1:19:49] <chll0ne> iceman is op baby
[1:19:51] <alephalpha> alsothey had young jean out him at one point in amoment of very abd writing
[1:19:51] <+sinistersally> Favorite Icman panel: "I'm gay???"
[1:19:52] <theCoolChild> Half the XMen are immortal BEFORE Krakoa
[1:20:03] <Kei_Ar_> i thought reggie had a huge glass of milk
[1:20:04] <MonsieurHonHon> Iceman is Gief tier of babby
[1:20:11] <+scorpiozilla> Did you know that Spider-Man's powers are actually magical in nature?
[1:20:12] <neroblind88> @alephalpha very bad writing
[1:20:13] <coreybom> Chuck Austen was the absolutely worse. Thank god for whedon, cause he fucked over the x-men hard.
[1:20:13] <willg1222> i thought bosses were only playable in console versions?
[1:20:13] <%FuqBoiSlim> Joe Chill was an inside agent
[1:20:21] <Dementedpenguin> The worst is when a new writer comes on board and tries to retcon stuff the previous writer did. That's the worst in comics LUL
[1:20:23] <eddie_hedgehog> hi im on
[1:20:33] <trickquestionz> Alfred Chill
[1:20:35] <chll0ne> i like spider-man’s power being somewhat mystical tbh
[1:20:38] <+sinistersally> Bobby so stupid someone needed to tell him he's gay
[1:20:39] <Ipsenscastle> @Dementedpenguin that's how Mr Sinister got ruined
[1:20:41] <+GalacticaPhanto> Iceman being gay was the best for me because as a kid I was attracted to that ass
[1:20:41] <chll0ne> madame webb is dop
[1:20:44] <Dementedpenguin> Especially if it was a great writer

[1:26:37] <%Reverend_Roscoe> or L L M M H H
[1:26:42] <+RichardMF_> doesn't this have a bunch of infinites?
[1:26:58] <%FuqBoiSlim> its a 90s capcom game im sure it does
[1:27:12] <trickquestionz> Remember when that scottish lady de-aged Magneto into an infant to help him get over his Holocaust trauma?
[1:27:17] <+zorakhazix> I love that little transparent health bar when your health is on a pixel
[1:27:19] <ReimuHakureiShrine> Did you use Akuma yet?
[1:27:35] <huskarl_zap> no akuma
[1:27:36] <ReimuHakureiShrine> THAT'S TOO MUCH CHIP DAMAGE
[1:27:36] <coreybom> @trickquestionz I fucking love comic books LUL
[1:27:38] <rasamune> I forget, is this game good?
[1:27:47] <eddie_hedgehog> DAMMIT
[1:27:58] <coreybom> @rasamune its a classic my dude.
[1:28:04] <eddie_hedgehog> gg bros
[1:28:11] <%FuqBoiSlim> @eddie_hedgehog it was real close tho
[1:28:19] <eddie_hedgehog> i just started playing too

[1:28:58] <Ipsenscastle> Akuma is in this too, Idk if you can use him in multi though
[1:29:14] <TeepPhoenix> Are we doing the Parsec thing in this stream
[1:29:15] <TeepPhoenix> ?

[1:29:30] <Daxalog> Images you can hear
[1:29:35] <eddie_hedgehog> she requires movement bro
[1:29:35] <Applecannon63> FUCKING DO AN INFINITE
[1:29:37] <%LCLSmoothie> SCOOPS
[1:29:46] <Applecannon63> AHHHH
[1:29:47] <huskarl_zap> HAGAAN DAAS
[1:29:49] <Lophostrix_> man this was a good fucking game, makes me nostalgic
[1:29:51] <357Sneak> dnoNLT dnoNLT
[1:29:55] <huskarl_zap> THAT AINT FALCO
[1:29:55] <%FuqBoiSlim> JEAAAAAAAAN
[1:30:05] <trickquestionz> Cyclops dodging them bolts like he dodges paying child support.
[1:30:14] <SocialMisfitGamer> TYPHOOOON
[1:30:19] <TeepPhoenix> FightK2? Is that what we're doing?
[1:30:34] <%justmildlilac> Yea
[1:30:36] <+GalacticaPhanto> man Cyclops is such a dumb nerd but his FG version is so dope
[1:30:41] <Fantomaz89> O- O- O- Optic Blast
[1:30:41] <SocialMisfitGamer> Storm's yell is stuck in my head
[1:30:48] <+TopTieramisu> cyclops power is so metal
[1:30:50] <trickquestionz> "I will create a snowstorm!"
[1:30:56] <+TopTieramisu> his eyes are portals to a dimension of pure energy
[1:31:03] <eddie_hedgehog> yeah all 3
[1:31:03] <UltimateDomon> Love how sassy he is with his laser pose
[1:31:19] <KaiserMario> I always misheard Cyclops Gene splice as "Jesus Christ"
[1:31:24] <coreybom> @trickquestionz Hey, ain’t his flaut he kids got stolen and chucked into the future.
[1:31:28] <eddie_hedgehog> this game is fun tho
[1:31:30] <%FuqBoiSlim> Cyclops is a lil zesty in the game huh GayPride
[1:31:42] <%kyh9> Anyone wanna hear some more weird Xmen stories or have questions they want answered?
[1:31:49] <MonsieurHonHon> Weird stories is fine
[1:31:51] <eddie_hedgehog> nuuu
[1:32:11] <Applecannon63> whats the deal with Jubilee?
[1:32:12] <+GalacticaPhanto> I mean the Capcom games were part of the reason I came out as bi, all these dudes, double cheeked up on a Thursday
[1:32:19] <KaiserMario> She's a vampire now
[1:32:21] <TeepPhoenix> I can't find this FightK2 thing.
[1:32:23] <trickquestionz> Tell us the lore of the Black Womb Project.
[1:32:26] <+TopTieramisu> i don't think she's a vampire anymore
[1:32:32] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL double cheeked up on a Tuesday
[1:32:33] <%FuqBoiSlim> @teepphoenix its "Fightcade 2"
[1:32:38] <TeepPhoenix> Jubes has gotten over her vampirism
[1:32:39] <KaiserMario> Oh... She's a single mom now
[1:32:44] <TeepPhoenix> Oh, OK thanks
[1:32:54] <+jiggy_snipe> remember when Capcom could pick any Marvel character
[1:32:58] <coreybom> @toptieramisu Yeah, shes cured. and a mom now.
[1:33:08] <%kyh9> @MonsieurHonHon So a weird aspect of the Xmen that is basically NEVER touched upon in the movies is the Shi'ar empire. I think they showed up in the most recent Dark Phoenix movie but they're usually just omitted
[1:33:08] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:33:09] <TeepPhoenix> I love ShumaGorath
[1:33:10] <neroblind88> tentacles
[1:33:12] <neroblind88> LUL
[1:33:20] <TeepPhoenix> I hope he's in the next Doc Strange movie
[1:33:29] <%kyh9> The Shi'ar empire basically control most of the known galaxy, even more than the Skrull or Kree
[1:33:33] <Applecannon63> So Jubilee got Toriyama-ed?
[1:33:36] <KaiserMario> I think he was confirmed for Dr Strange 2
[1:33:37] <Ipsenscastle> The fact they wasted a slot on Blackheart for MSHvsSF still annoys me
[1:33:46] <KaiserMario> "he"
[1:33:48] <neroblind88> @Applecannon63 lol yes
[1:33:51] <trickquestionz> @kyh9 Oh my god I forgot about them. Every now and then Xavier stops dealing with racism to go fuck an alien princess.
[1:33:53] <Lophostrix_> blackheart was dope stfu
[1:33:53] <%kyh9> And their first introduction was when Xavier and their Empress wanted to fuck each other in their dreams. And then they met up in real life and fucked for real
[1:34:04] <Ipsenscastle> @Lophostrix_ that's fair
[1:34:05] <%kyh9> @trickquestionz And now he has an alien daughter on the throne
[1:34:08] <coreybom> @kyh9 Nah, they were SUPPOSED to be skulls. But captain marvel did their version so that fucked them over.
[1:34:10] <MonsieurHonHon> bruh this was legit until the last sentence
[1:34:13] <%jetjagger222> UCHITOTTARI
[1:34:45] <+Creggamonsta> we stay eating
[1:34:50] <+jiggy_snipe> Reg
[1:35:00] <TeepPhoenix> I'd challenge, but I'm still downloading the program.
[1:35:02] <%jetjagger222> omega reg
[1:35:03] <eddie_hedgehog> holy fuck
[1:35:05] <alephalpha> is this the thing with "rocky" all ove rgaian
[1:35:12] <%kyh9> @coreybom That's very possible. But the Skrull in Captain Marvel are kind of on the back foot. The Shi'Ar Empire are a fucking Empire that control basically a little over 51% of the galaxy and are based as fuck
[1:35:21] <KaiserMario> The X'iar empire has some of the dumbest things in Marvel, like the Gladiator...
[1:35:30] <%LCLSmoothie> remember that time magneto ripped wolverines adamtium out of body and became a weird monster man without a nose
[1:35:32] <eddie_hedgehog> this game is sick
[1:35:32] <+jiggy_snipe> Reggie we are not calling you Red
[1:35:40] <TeepPhoenix> TERNADO CLAW
[1:35:43] <JdotSweapA> Red make U Dead!
[1:35:44] <Applecannon63> What is Omega red and with silver phalic whip(tentacles)?
[1:35:44] <trickquestionz> Xavier also wanted to fuck Jean and one point. And not when she was all mature and independent.
[1:35:45] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[1:35:48] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[1:35:48] <MonsieurHonHon> Woolie be nicer to your friend red
[1:35:50] <%kyh9> @coreybom But yeah, I can imagine Marvel is trying to find a way to slot them in. It's weird that they chose to fuck with the Skrulls so soon since we cna't do Secret Invasion anymore
[1:35:51] <+Creggamonsta> hahah
[1:35:51] <neroblind88> wat
[1:35:54] <TeepPhoenix> I am ginger
[1:35:55] <$RunningNGunning> GOTTEM
[1:35:59] <%Solidnick18> Reggie
[1:35:59] <%kyh9> @KaiserMario You mean Deathbird?
[1:36:00] <+twohitgood> is he pat?
[1:36:03] <scrumbotime> Reggie is now Ginger
[1:36:05] <tearfuldevil> ????
[1:36:06] <BalloniWright> Oh hey it's Wolverine form Fortnite PogChamp
[1:36:10] <+Creggamonsta> i am also ginger
[1:36:10] <+twohitgood> reggie is pat confirmed
[1:36:11] <BalloniWright> from*
[1:36:15] <trickquestionz> Reggie trying to appropriate Pat's culture over here.
[1:36:19] <%kyh9> @coreybom Who is currently fucking one of the New Mutants who bought an apartment on the Shi'Ar homeworld?
[1:36:21] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Oh... no... not deathbird...
[1:36:32] <+jiggy_snipe> call Reggie, Rouge
[1:36:36] <KaiserMario> Sorry, mistyped there
[1:36:36] <%LCLSmoothie> tfw fortnite has a better marvel roster than MVCi
[1:36:37] <%Mr_Strut> Next thing you know, Reggie will have to poop naked
[1:36:41] <SpaceLTN> rougie
[1:36:41] <coreybom> @kyh9 Nah, the writers of dark phoenix confirmed that was the case. Hell, they were going to go full cosmic, but the marvel bs kinda fucked them.
[1:36:41] <TeepPhoenix> Deathbird is a jobber
[1:36:44] <%kyh9> @KaiserMario They have some of the dumbest names but I can go with it
[1:36:51] <eddie_hedgehog> backwards hcb all three kicks
[1:36:57] <Applecannon63> What is the context of Omega Red's power being tentacles?
[1:37:03] <coreybom> @kyh9 no idea. gotta grab their current run.
[1:37:05] <scrumbotime> So if Reggie is Pat now, does Pat like feet?
[1:37:06] <TeepPhoenix> There isn't any
[1:37:13] <eddie_hedgehog> get it reggie
[1:37:18] <tearfuldevil> @Applecannon63 they're adamantine implants, iirc?
[1:37:18] <%jetjagger222> wasn't he a soviet experiment
[1:37:22] <+jiggy_snipe> @Applecannon63 he's like Wolverine but tentacles
[1:37:22] <%kyh9> @coreybom That's disappointing. And then Jean has her Jea-sus moment and becomes energy. I get these runs are kind of elaborate but cmon. At least get the gist
[1:37:25] <%Reverend_Roscoe> Menitta gave em the business for a minute there
[1:37:30] <zakor1138> It's not like Deathbird is her actual name
[1:37:31] <trickquestionz> @scrumbotime He couldn't catch the furry barge either, had to take the feet canoe
[1:37:31] <TeepPhoenix> Omega Red's "real" power is the death factor, which is supposed to be the opposite of the "healing" factor of Wolverine
[1:37:32] <%kyh9> God knows we're never getting E for Extinction
[1:37:33] <+Creggamonsta> omg
[1:37:34] <@Menitta> LUL
[1:37:35] <%LCLSmoothie> @Applecannon63 so omega reds power isnt the tencales, rather he has death spores which kill anything near him
[1:37:37] <DDDorsett> LUL
[1:37:37] <KaiserMario> @kyh9 Not only the names are dumb af, but the characters themselves and the plots that happen with them, are all really stupid
[1:37:38] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[1:37:42] <%Solidnick18> hahaha
[1:37:48] <alephalpha> pls stop reggie
[1:37:49] <zakor1138> Wolverine's real name isn't "Wolverine"
[1:38:00] <%s_xylocalsingles> LETS GO RED
[1:38:02] <%Solidnick18> it's a joke for reggie
[1:38:04] <%afronooch> redgie
[1:38:07] <%kyh9> @KaiserMario They're fun when they're messing with the X-men, but yeah, on their own, they're as boring as the Inhumans (who have and always will be boring except for Kamala)
[1:38:11] <$RunningNGunning> I like it Reggie, I like the joke
[1:38:15] <dapperdoop> night mode on the couch tonight
[1:38:21] <%kyh9> The only reason Kamala is fun is because she's written like a Mutant instead of an Inhuman
[1:38:28] <%kyh9> She doesn't have to deal with the stupid royalty bullshit
[1:38:29] <Ipsenscastle> i like Reggie's joke
[1:38:31] <eddie_hedgehog> nice!

[1:40:10] <eddie_hedgehog> edit the mugen.cfg woolie
[1:40:13] <DDDorsett> Those are something else
[1:40:26] <TheactualDiepod> We can boot camp right now Woolie, get you back in shape
[1:40:31] <trickquestionz> Was Mrs. Marvel super pissed when she woke up from that coma Rogue put her in and found out everyone liked her more at that point?
[1:40:44] <KaiserMario> @kyh9 The Inhumans, the Eternals, the X'iar, and those space pirated that Nightcrawler hangs out with, are just some examples of the stupid shit Marvel populates the universe with
[1:41:00] <KaiserMario> *pirates
[1:41:02] <eddie_hedgehog> dirty
[1:41:08] <%jetjagger222> starjammers?
[1:41:13] <eddie_hedgehog> nice
[1:41:15] <coreybom> @kyh9 Yep. Helped her writing was actually mulism. I love miles, but often the best writers for a non-white character is those who are like those characters.
[1:41:19] <%jetjagger222> cyclops' dad and his furry wife
[1:41:21] <%kyh9> @KaiserMario A lot of that cosmic shit can be cool but it's usually made too unrelatable. Here's hoping that Eternals movie is good
[1:41:36] <Ipsenscastle> That dome in the background is a specific reference to a Savage Land story from like 78ish, where there was this guy called the Sun King who built a big dome over a volcano or some shit
[1:41:42] <trickquestionz> Remember when Rogue was supposed be convinced as a result of lesbian shapeshifting?
[1:41:46] <Applecannon63> Cyclop's mom is a furry?
[1:41:50] <@Menitta> GGs Reggie
[1:41:58] <%jetjagger222> nah cyke and havok's mom got killed by the shiar
[1:42:03] <theCoolChild> So who here remembers X-men Destiny? The last X-men game ever made?
[1:42:03] <%LCLSmoothie> cant stop staring at wovelrines ass
[1:42:03] <+RealThiele> mirror to the phantom zone
[1:42:05] <%afronooch> we love redgie
[1:42:07] <alephalpha> what did reggie do?
[1:42:09] <%kyh9> @coreybom The biggest issue with Miles is that, early on, he was just black Peter. That sounds like something some incel comic fan would say but he has the same backstory, same interests, same demeanor and persona as Peter. Spider-verse fucking saved him, thank god
[1:42:12] <KaiserMario> OH GOD I just remembered Cyclops dad is one of those dumb space pirates!
[1:42:16] <JdotSweapA> Woolie you just jelous of the RED!
[1:42:18] <%kyh9> CORSAIR
[1:42:18] <%Reverend_Roscoe> full set?
[1:42:20] <@Menitta> I do not Dishonor my family with OTGs
[1:42:20] <%kyh9> THE STAR JAMMERS
[1:42:21] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @WoolieVersus
[1:42:23] <%jetjagger222> yeah corsair
[1:42:26] <coreybom> @trickquestionz But that fucker in charge was too much of a coward.
[1:42:28] <+BigBruthaThunda> Woolie has Redgie bias
[1:42:34] <TheactualDiepod> oh\
[1:42:38] <TheactualDiepod> yeah I guess
[1:42:38] <%jetjagger222> when i was a kid and i saw him in the cartoon i thought his name was "coarse hair"
[1:42:40] <%kyh9> Does anyone remember how Psylocke is actually a white woman possessing the body of a ninja woman?
[1:42:44] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @KaiserMario
[1:42:48] <%kyh9> Elizabeth Braddock
[1:42:54] <neroblind88> lol
[1:42:56] <%afronooch> wait.. Red-G is bit more on brand
[1:42:58] <+smikeye> @kyh9 she's also the sister of Captain Britain
[1:43:07] <neroblind88> banned for talking shit about starjammers
[1:43:08] <%jetjagger222> isn't psylocke white again in the comics
[1:43:12] <%TubeMan642> Pick Spiral
[1:43:13] <KaiserMario> Corsair and his stupid bandana
[1:43:16] <%LCLSmoothie> yes
[1:43:17] <%kyh9> @smikeye Well these days, she's Captain Britain herself but yeah, Brian Braddock is a cool guy
[1:43:31] <$SilverRoddo> I wanna see Woolie do some wood working.
[1:43:32] <%kyh9> @jetjagger222 Yeah, but I think this Jim Lee version iswhen she's still possessed
[1:43:33] <+xddddsorandom> Man get a load out of Corsair
[1:43:36] <Applecannon63> wait Cyclopes dad is a space pirates and mom a beastmen whats the story on that?
[1:43:42] <coreybom> @kyh9 I sadly disagree, but spider verse and his later runs did breath some new life in my boy. I guess i was happy seeing a half black/rican kid like me. hell, around the same as well.
[1:43:44] <%kyh9> @Applecannon63 Love finds a way
[1:43:44] <%LCLSmoothie> kwanon and psylocke are back in their original bodies currently
[1:43:46] <+xddddsorandom> Hepzibah is hot okay
[1:43:50] <%jetjagger222> no not the mom, the step-wife
[1:44:11] <+xddddsorandom> Yeah her name is Hepzibah
[1:44:21] <%jetjagger222> and there was some dude with a sword
[1:44:22] <tearfuldevil> @Applecannon63 dunno about his mom, but in the...plane crash? that supposedly killed his dad, his dad was aCTUALLY abducted by aliens pretty much
[1:44:30] <%jetjagger222> i forgot if there were other members
[1:44:35] <tearfuldevil> big evilish space empire, same one that's queen Xavier fucks
[1:44:37] <eddie_hedgehog> i think he can
[1:44:49] <tearfuldevil> and he became like, an anti slave type space pirate?
[1:44:55] <eddie_hedgehog> lmao
[1:44:57] <tearfuldevil> and eventually took over the empire?
[1:45:02] <coreybom> @applecannon63 Nah, mom is dead. His dad is a space pirate though. Young slim from the past actually got to go on adventures with him.
[1:45:02] <Ipsenscastle> Corsair, Hepzibah, Raza and Ch'od
[1:45:03] <+smikeye> I've found it's generally just been good practice to ignore all perpetually ongoing superhero comics
[1:45:07] <%kyh9> @coreybom I just really did not like the Bendis runs. I can't understand how Bendis can write House of M and then turn around and fuck up so many other things
[1:45:12] <+xddddsorandom> Isn't Corsairs gang called the Spacejammers
[1:45:13] <%jetjagger222> ch'od! i knew i was missing someone

[1:46:45] <Fyrijou> @chll0ne noted 👍🏻
[1:46:48] <+smikeye> John Byrne told some all-time X-Men stories and created some major characters, he's also got lots of bad stuff in his biblioagraphy
[1:46:48] <KaiserMario> @Fyrijou 1. Don't be abusive or shitty. Listen to the mods. 2. No really, please be cool, especially about the stuff you really, really care about. 3. No spoilers outside of the #spoilerhole room!
[1:46:50] <%Reverend_Roscoe> Fucking sentinel
[1:46:55] <%Navekraith> Robit like my wamen
[1:46:57] <%jetjagger222> @357Sneak holy shit is dat some chelnov
[1:46:58] <Shardlab> @xddddsorandom You're not wrong. He's just not utilized to the best of character most of the time
[1:46:59] <TheactualDiepod> no i dont have fightcade
[1:47:01] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> As someone who didn't keep up with X-Men past the early 2000's, all the stories I hear make me think that shit got dumb
[1:47:02] <$SilverRoddo> Where did he take her to?
[1:47:02] <coreybom> @kyh9 Priest is one of the best. Man made black panther what he is today.
[1:47:13] <Fyrijou> @kaisermario noted, thanks 👍🏻
[1:47:14] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1310937719246385153?s=19
[1:47:23] <%FuqBoiSlim> @fyrijou in general is fine
[1:47:24] <MonsieurHonHon> cyclops a hoe
[1:47:26] <TheactualDiepod> I 'm a fan of the art, but I wouldn't call myself serious lol
[1:47:26] <%pajamarammaslamma> The effect to make psylockes chest jiggle is honestly neat. Like holding the chest static while the rest of her body animates is kind of clever
[1:47:28] <%TubeMan642> Spiral?
[1:47:29] <neroblind88> @xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx got real dumb
[1:47:36] <Applecannon63> cyclope is like a mary sue?
[1:47:38] <%kyh9> @coreybom True. It's a shame we'll probably never get any of his runs put on the big screen but I loved the entire BP In America stuff
[1:47:39] <%FuqBoiSlim> LETS GOOO SPIRAL
[1:47:47] <+xddddsorandom> Cyclops has some of the coolest moments and character development of all of the characters, you can't tell me that Scott post Astonishing X-Men arc isn't super cool
[1:47:54] <+smikeye> 52 and Civil War combined got me to drop back out of comics and apart from reading some completed volumes online of random stuff, I stick to small things mostly. and manga
[1:47:55] <357Sneak> qwertiZoom / good eye, @jetjagger222 !
[1:47:58] <%jetjagger222> cyclops has been made to seem like a jerk since the aughts
[1:48:00] <%kyh9> Though T'Challa having two underage wives-in-waiting probably wouldn't fly these days @coreybom
[1:48:03] <cerazor01> DRILL CLAW
[1:48:06] <coreybom> @applecannon63 Oh god no. hes more complex than a mary sue.
[1:48:07] <Shardlab> @Applecannon63 Naw. He's just a straight man to the more interesting characters around him.
[1:48:17] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> @neroblind88 The only story I heard that people seemed to like was House of M. Is there anything else worth reading?
[1:48:20] <KaiserMario> I think this is the most accurate version of Wolverine outside of comics
[1:48:23] <%pajamarammaslamma> medu clauw
[1:48:29] <agadejobi> Christ
[1:48:30] <chll0ne> midget logan
[1:48:31] <+xddddsorandom> Scott is the LEAST Mary Sue, he literally went through like a decade of people writing him like an asshole for character development purposes
[1:48:35] <agadejobi> I can't believe that Black Panther is dead
[1:48:39] <ReimuHakureiShrine> When we gonna play Tecmo Super Bowl on fightcade?
[1:48:44] <%FuqBoiSlim> the blue and yellow just hits different
[1:48:46] <brunoberserk> OMEGA REDO
[1:48:47] <+smikeye> Cyclops is a pretty good barometer of the writer's take on the X-Men, if he's a shit character, it's probably not gonna go great
[1:48:51] <%pajamarammaslamma> wait tecmo bowl got a sequel
[1:48:53] <cerazor01> This Stage is so goddamn pretty
[1:48:56] <Shardlab> Best Cyclops story in media: Mystique kidnapping him and leaving him without glasses out in the middle of nowhere in Mexico
[1:48:59] <MattDemers> Big peak
[1:49:00] <chll0ne> @smikeye agreed
[1:49:13] <%justmildlilac> @smikeye So, he's like Superman?
[1:49:13] <+MK_Ineptitude> @xddddsorandom no one here reads comics buddy
[1:49:14] <coreybom> @kyh9 yeah, reading that was pretty fucking weird. but yeah, its sad we wont be seeing any of his stuff. rest on power chadwick.
[1:49:18] <+s0lesurviv0r> the original Potemkin
[1:49:19] <%kyh9> @agadejobi They'll probably just have Shuri take over. I doubt they'd break out Kasper Cole any time soon
[1:49:21] <$SilverRoddo> I assume a Secret Wars fighting game would be a good one, everything that MVCI tried to be.
[1:49:24] <%FuqBoiSlim> @shardlab yeah and he got called a gringo in the middle of an alley, ill never forget
[1:49:26] <+xddddsorandom> MK_Ineptitude I do :)
[1:49:33] <neroblind88> @xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx i dont have any recommendations of the top of my head, probably have to ask others in chat.
[1:49:35] <@Moobot> Please don't fill up the entire chat, @Fyrijou
[1:49:46] <%kyh9> @coreybom On a side note, Priest is writing a USAgent run soon
[1:49:48] <cerazor01> oi Moobot
[1:49:49] <cerazor01> cmon
[1:49:55] <neroblind88> damn, moobot goin crazy
[1:49:57] <%kyh9> @coreybom So it's gonna be pretty wild
[1:49:59] <Fyrijou> @moobot sorry
[1:50:01] <%FuqBoiSlim> Moobot at it again
[1:50:02] <chll0ne> cmon moobot
[1:50:08] <agadejobi> They need to bring back the Supremacists, so Black Panther can beat them up again
[1:50:09] <+smikeye> a USAgent series right now seems...sketch
[1:50:09] <Dementedpenguin> Fight me, Moobot.
[1:50:09] <%Reverend_Roscoe> lol low latency on twitch is slightly faster than the fightcade spectating
[1:50:15] <%kyh9> I wonder if any of the new Miles comics are good this year
[1:50:15] <Dementedpenguin> OR NOT. i'M SORRY.
[1:50:21] <Dementedpenguin> *sorry caps LUL
[1:50:21] <coreybom> @kyh9 Yeah i heard. Cant wait, the previews look nuts.
[1:50:28] <Jessie_Lockhart> For a sec it looked like big boy summoned birds as his super
[1:50:28] <KaiserMario> @kyh9 How do you feel about eXcalibur?
[1:50:35] <%FuqBoiSlim> don't apologize to the bot show em who's boss shofuBlam
[1:50:42] <Fyrijou> @moobot kinda let myself go over a topic, sry
[1:50:48] <cerazor01> MACHINE VS MEN
[1:50:55] <Dementedpenguin> Wait. Moobot didn't attack. I take that back, I win. Kappa
[1:50:57] <coreybom> @kyh9 apparently his recent run is pretty good. it dives into recent issues going down.
[1:51:02] <%LCLSmoothie> man superhero comics are cool but man theyre stupid
[1:51:05] <chll0ne> @fyrijou youre good bro
[1:51:10] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> @Fyrijou It's a bot. Don't worry. It just auto deletes messages if you type big paragraphs or in all caps
[1:51:19] <automata93> Loved your bit on Botchamania Wooly
[1:51:24] <Fyrijou> Aight, noted
[1:51:25] <%jetjagger222> its so dependent on the individual runs, it sucks
[1:51:26] <+smikeye> Wolverine is a good example of the less exposure a character gets, the fresher they can feel
[1:51:28] <%FuqBoiSlim> Unless you're subbed then he lets go wild
[1:51:29] <coreybom> @smikeye Hey, write it right and you can have a brutal classic.

[1:52:11] <Fyrijou> @fuqboislim i will try to make it shorter now: i feel like Cyclops could‘ve bern one of Marvel‘s best characters, but A LOT of bad writing ruined him for me
[1:52:12] <+smikeye> @coreybom USAgent's personality was considered hard-right for the 80s when he was created, which granted by today's standards is pretty tame
[1:52:14] <%jetjagger222> MrDestructoid
[1:52:15] <neroblind88> *master
[1:52:18] <eddie_hedgehog> that was weird
[1:52:27] <%jetjagger222> @smikeye that's a funny observation
[1:52:28] <eddie_hedgehog> maybe?
[1:52:31] <%kyh9> @coreybom I'll check it out then. I'm pretty excited since the Miles Morales game story seems to be informing his character with some direction from Spider-verse. And it's also giving his mom something to actually do so hopefully we see some more interactions
[1:52:37] <thesickestzak> This game looks okay, but it doesn't have the best fighting game character, Minecraft Steve. So is it even really worth playing?
[1:52:39] <TheactualDiepod> Mster
[1:52:40] <townzzzzz> does with ! may not have a wired connection
[1:52:52] <chll0ne> @lclsmoothie explaining why mutants exist would be easier than explaining why da vinci is a woman
[1:52:53] <neroblind88> lol
[1:52:56] <KaiserMario> @kyh9 How about classic eXcalibur, with Captain Britain, Kitty Pryde and her dragon, and that Phoenix from Mojo world
[1:53:01] <cerazor01> the ! isn't even very accurate
[1:53:07] <Fyrijou> @woolieversus have you, by any coincidence, met the 2 bisexual women ever again?
[1:53:10] <%jetjagger222> @chll0ne didn't da vinci just want to be the mona lisa
[1:53:21] <cerazor01> ive had unstable matches with people without the !
[1:53:24] <TheactualDiepod> Half way through the get hits, she needs her air special and her second super
[1:53:26] <%FuqBoiSlim> @fyrijou alright cool you'll fit right in here
[1:53:38] <%LCLSmoothie> @chll0ne i remember watching a "cable explained" video and i left more confused than before
[1:53:40] <Fyrijou> @fuqboislim 😁
[1:53:43] <chll0ne> sumn like that
[1:53:44] <neroblind88> nice !
[1:53:44] <%M3djedx> woolieYE
[1:53:46] <+smikeye> do mutants exist in comics again in large numbers? I know disney made marvel kill most of them off because movie rights and they didn't want to promote movies they didn't own
[1:53:55] <TheactualDiepod> shes pretty close, but I need to figure out the gems
[1:54:00] <chll0ne> feels weird to search hentai of da vinci tho
[1:54:04] <%kyh9> @KaiserMario Also pretty good. Very weird since it's basically Kate and Nightcrawler going on very Claremont-esque fantasy/pirate adventures
[1:54:09] <cerazor01> Search that Hentai
[1:54:16] <%kyh9> I don't remember too much about the Phoenix/Mojo stuff
[1:54:16] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts

[1:54:35] <Fyrijou> @smikeye i haven‘t read comics consistently, but there was a story lastly and... do you want to get spoilered?
[1:54:36] <cerazor01> Psylocke owo
[1:54:47] <ThatGuyThere03> Follow that man
[1:54:48] <+smikeye> I don't care about spoilers, you can PM them to me
[1:54:54] <neroblind88> Follow Diepod on twitter !
[1:54:57] <DDDorsett> Janmy Marvel mugen
[1:55:02] <DDDorsett> *janky
[1:55:04] <Fyrijou> Aight, right at it
[1:55:06] <%jetjagger222> man psylocke's sprite looks super yellow
[1:55:08] <coreybom> @smikeye Nah, that was before the movie shit when they killed them off in mass. but they were fucking them over for it. Its much better now though.
[1:55:09] <DDDorsett> Those are something
[1:55:12] <KaiserMario> @kyh9 Yeah, I loved those, they were very weird/fun, you could tell the writers were enjoying working on it
[1:55:21] <%kyh9> @KaiserMario I haven't re-read old Excalibur in a while tho. But I wish that some of those weirder side-stories got incorporated into the characters. Kitty Pryde and Nightcrawler get done pretty dirty in popular media
[1:55:39] <%jetjagger222> it looks like its just the contrast with her costume, the actual skin color isn't that yellow
[1:55:48] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> @TheactualDiepod Can you drop the Twitter handle so I can check it out?
[1:55:51] <neroblind88> @jetjagger222 jim lee loves exaggeration
[1:55:58] <%kyh9> @KaiserMario Yeah, it reminds me how the interviews with Claremont basically have him attributing the quality of the stories to the fact that x-men wasn't popular enough to have lots of fans to piss off, so they had more freedom to get weird
[1:56:06] <+smikeye> jim lee's psyloche was a go-to as an early teen
[1:56:13] <Applecannon63> yellow skins looks very stereotype
[1:56:22] <%jetjagger222> dat pose

[1:56:59] <andrewofbob> Canada loses
[1:57:02] <+smikeye> IIRC they bought Malibu comics primarily for their good printers
[1:57:06] <%LCLSmoothie> yo diepod, your spidewoman looks dope!

[1:57:38] <TheactualDiepod> its fine
[1:57:38] <eddie_hedgehog> its just fightcade its buggy sometimes
[1:57:42] <%kyh9> @coreybom MCU Xmen needs to focus on the team as a whole. Not just Wolverine and his stuff
[1:57:43] <TheactualDiepod> dont worry about it
[1:57:46] <@Menitta> Oh whisper it to me
[1:57:54] <neroblind88> his spiderwoman is basically a canon sprite
[1:57:58] <Shardlab> @jetjagger222 Beast was a very fun character. But I saw the old pilot with Nightcrawler first and felt cheated by him not being there and Beast being similar

[2:03:51] <%kyh9> @KaiserMario It really leaned into the school aspect of the X-men that was popular in the late 90s/early 2000s. But it did weird things with some of the ages, like making Rogue, Scott, Jean and Kitty the same age
[2:03:56] <%kyh9> But Logan is still older
[2:04:05] <%LCLSmoothie> still thinking about goth rouge.....
[2:04:09] <%jetjagger222> mah man
[2:04:09] <%kyh9> At least we got an okay porn game out of it
[2:04:18] <cerazor01> PixelBob
[2:04:21] <MonsieurHonHon> What was up with 00s cartoon and goth chick
[2:04:24] <chll0ne> zone? Kappa @kyh9
[2:04:24] <coreybom> @kaisermario Would love a proper version of god loves man kills. would be SO relevant today.
[2:04:26] <%jetjagger222> its a really nice character design
[2:04:31] <chll0ne> @monsieurhonhon evolution
[2:04:31] <%kyh9> @chll0ne Oni
[2:04:33] <%kyh9> Rogue-like
[2:04:43] <MonsieurHonHon> I meant in general
[2:04:47] <cerazor01> Colussus with that Heavy Voice
[2:04:49] <Fyrijou> I only came quickly to check Woolie‘s stream. It‘s currently 3:33 am here in Switzerland and i‘m tired. Goodnight everyone and enjoy the Stream! ❤️
[2:04:50] <%LCLSmoothie> southern goth girls dancefMonaS dancefMonaS
[2:04:58] <cerazor01> I have yet found a man who can outsmart SUPLEX
[2:05:01] <chll0ne> goth was a big thing back then
[2:05:01] <neroblind88> goodnight @Fyrijou
[2:05:02] <%jetjagger222> @MonsieurHonHon maybe it was the type of a lot of the folks behind those shows
[2:05:07] <MonsieurHonHon> @Fyrijou Good night
[2:05:12] <%kyh9> @MonsieurHonHon Goth girls like that were semi-common in high school in the 90s. Then you get out of high-school, work in the cartoon industry and insert your own fetishes everywhere
[2:05:13] <%jetjagger222> it was on-era late 90s and early aughts
[2:05:20] <kayamek> All Colosus needed this game was the arcade beatem p scream
[2:05:20] <cerazor01> Its 11:34 in Australia, and I feel sick and shit and im in bed.
[2:05:27] <%LCLSmoothie> @kayamek AGGGHHH
[2:05:29] <Wan6Saber> junkersREKT
[2:05:32] <%donkeytron2000> dos vidaniya
[2:05:35] <MonsieurHonHon> Probably lel @kyh9
[2:05:44] <kayamek> @LCLSmoothie AGHHGHHGH
[2:05:46] <huskarl_zap> Whens punisher
[2:05:48] <cerazor01> Vivec
[2:05:57] <cerazor01> Punisher would be sick in a fg
[2:06:02] <MonsieurHonHon> Did I hear a sallty rematch?
[2:06:04] <%jetjagger222> the hitsparks when colossus blocks attacks looks super sick
[2:06:09] <KaiserMario> @coreybom Yeah, that'd be very cool too, specially with the success of Logan, X-men proved it can do something like that
[2:06:12] <%kyh9> Would love to see this type of game but with Jubes, House of Xavier, Lorna and maybe also Gorgon
[2:06:14] <neroblind88> @kyh9 basically lol
[2:06:14] <cerazor01> But I can't help but remember Over weight Stryker from MK3
[2:06:20] <%jetjagger222> mall cop stryker
[2:06:22] <%LCLSmoothie> they shouldve used punisher instead of winter solider in MVCI
[2:06:24] <%jetjagger222> bill murray stryker
[2:07:03] <cerazor01> Woolie tried to 'nothin' personnal kid' Colussus
[2:07:10] <%FuqBoiSlim> @lclsmoothie B-But muh MCU synergy!!!
[2:07:14] <%kyh9> @MonsieurHonHon @neroblind88 Same brown haired kids having crushes on red-heads was a common trope in the late aughts/early 2010s
[2:07:14] <cerazor01> and he was having none of that Bolshevik shit
[2:07:26] <%kyh9> Where's the Proletarian skin?
[2:07:34] <%RyTYoung> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[2:07:41] <MonsieurHonHon> havent watched a lot of 10's cartoon
[2:07:43] <Wan6Saber> POGGERS
[2:08:09] <neroblind88> @kyh9 so many parallels
[2:08:18] <coreybom> @kaisermario In fairness, would disney want to incorporate things as dark as logan? Cause god loves is pretty fucking dark. Like, child hanging dark.
[2:08:18] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:08:21] <%kyh9> Trying to remember some more weird shit that happens in Xmen
[2:08:23] <KaiserMario> Oh yeah, and also a horror thing with the brood would ok, i guess
[2:08:33] <SpaceLTN> woolieGLORY
[2:08:35] <cerazor01> !MOTIVATED
[2:08:35] <@Moobot> 1741 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[2:08:45] <%kyh9> There's a Canadian-government funded Super Hero team called Alpha Flight, headed by a guy who wears a literal Canadian flag on his body as a suit
[2:08:47] <%jetjagger222> x-men had a dude named after a female mythological creature
[2:08:55] <%LCLSmoothie> puck is just pat
[2:08:58] <%kyh9> Vindicator was his name, I think
[2:09:11] <%jetjagger222> canada in x-men is evil
[2:09:14] <%kyh9> He is the Canadian Flag equivalent of Axl Low
[2:09:19] <+smikeye> I forget, was Vindicator a mutant or was ita super suit?
[2:09:22] <cerazor01> X
[2:09:28] <cerazor01> Ecxxxxx
[2:09:32] <%kyh9> @jetjagger222 It's the funniest shit that Canada is treated like the American Government in early Xmen comics
[2:09:35] <%FuqBoiSlim> CROSS
[2:09:37] <SomersaultJustice> cross
[2:09:42] <KaiserMario> @coreybom depends what they want to incorporate in the mcu, I mean, hoipefully they divesify the movies more so it's not just vanilla super-hero movies...
[2:09:56] <+smikeye> vanilla super hero movies seem to do ok
[2:10:06] <cerazor01> I can't stop hearing tf2 heavy with Collossus now.
[2:10:14] <+jiggy_snipe> MSH
[2:10:15] <%jetjagger222> x-men would actually probably better as a series than movies, with a good team of showrunners
[2:10:23] <+smikeye> so well, and so near ubiquitous I kinda don't care about marvel comics anymore
[2:10:38] <%jetjagger222> MSH had one selling point: playing as spidey
[2:10:45] <+jiggy_snipe> ^
[2:10:47] <+smikeye> x-men was always a soap opera style comic, it needs a series or miniseries over movies
[2:10:49] <KaiserMario> INFINITY!
[2:10:56] <neroblind88> @jetjagger222 YES ! an animated show >
[2:10:59] <@Menitta> Cuz there's Marvel Super Heroes, MSH vs SF, then Marvel vs Capcom
[2:10:59] <%LCLSmoothie> proton cannon!!
[2:11:09] <cerazor01> 'SEE YA LATER'
[2:11:23] <cerazor01> The Spiderman chant
[2:11:26] <KaiserMario> My boy Blackheart
[2:11:28] <%kyh9> would love an xmen anthology/slice of life series ala Justice League/Unlimited
[2:11:34] <%jetjagger222> exactly!
[2:11:42] <coreybom> @kaisermario They have to. DC is starting to hit a stride with the proper R-rated super hero films. Marvel, more accurately the MCU, is going to look pretty stale if they continue doing more vanilla fair.
[2:11:42] <eddie_hedgehog> nope
[2:11:44] <%jetjagger222> kinda like the 90s series but less hokey
[2:11:45] <%LCLSmoothie> thats the snes game!!!
[2:11:46] <eddie_hedgehog> thats the wrong one
[2:11:47] <cerazor01> War of the Gems is the side scroller
[2:11:48] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[2:11:48] <@Menitta> lol
[2:11:49] <%kyh9> Just weird stories here and there featuring different mutants
[2:11:53] <eddie_hedgehog> its just Marvel Super Heroes
[2:11:54] <neroblind88> Marvel Superheroes
[2:11:58] <+kryedge> WHEN'S MAHVEL? Oh right now
[2:12:03] <%LCLSmoothie> this game lied to millions of chidlern
[2:12:05] <%kyh9> War of Gems sounds like a very cool Steven Universe movie
[2:12:07] <%jetjagger222> its exactly like the alien vs predator game on snes
[2:12:12] <%jetjagger222> built on lies
[2:12:18] <cerazor01> War of the Gems sounds like Houseki No Kuni: Land of the Lustrious.
[2:12:22] <Kolpax619> it was so slow
[2:12:37] <cerazor01> Didn't Dr Doom get introduced in War of the Gems?
[2:12:50] <willg1222> not as good as mutant apocalypse
[2:12:55] <%LCLSmoothie> nah, hes in MSH
[2:13:08] <+StooEsq> Could be worse...could have been Alpha 2 SNES
[2:13:15] <%LCLSmoothie> as a pre-boss before thanos boss
[2:13:24] <cerazor01> I wonder if Woolie ever played the Quake Engine X-Men shooter.
[2:13:29] <eddie_hedgehog> it worked
[2:13:36] <+jiggy_snipe> it worked for me
[2:13:39] <%LCLSmoothie> @cerazor01 thats a deep cut i forgot that existed
[2:13:40] <MonsieurHonHon> I can fuck myself D:
[2:13:40] <%jetjagger222> @cerazor01 yo that was a thing and i completely forgot about it
[2:13:42] <cerazor01> Where all the enemies are Apocolypse Clones ofthe X-men.
[2:14:16] <cerazor01> And magneto creates you as a Mutant with the Ability to turn your Arms into GUN.
[2:14:20] <ThatGuyThere03> THE GOAT
[2:14:21] <MonsieurHonHon> I dont think I played this one
[2:14:30] <%The_Minotaur> God damn I love Juggernaut's sprite in this
[2:14:36] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Do you think that one scene in Infinity War, when Thanos makes the bubbles, was a nod to this?
[2:14:39] <neroblind88> the BEST Gem system
[2:14:40] <%The_Minotaur> Beefiest boy
[2:14:46] <+jiggy_snipe> OST
[2:14:47] <cerazor01> I love the goddamn colours in this Game.
[2:14:51] <%jetjagger222> i remember seeing this first in a bodega run by vietnamese folks
[2:14:56] <MonsieurHonHon> I defo didnt play this

[2:15:26] <neroblind88> longest 2d stage
[2:15:36] <TheactualDiepod> gotta break the tree

[2:16:09] <Meltgar> NO HONOR LUL
[2:16:21] <%LCLSmoothie> MY SUIT SO TIGHT
[2:16:23] <agadejobi> Even on the original, the stage loops infinately
[2:16:28] <agadejobi> Man, Reggie is on fire today
[2:16:37] <@Menitta> could you imagine Dhalsim on this stage
[2:16:38] <Dementedpenguin> I remember being super excited when this was announced for the Sega Saturn. I was starving for games at that point. LUL
[2:16:39] <neroblind88> get the GEMS PogChamp
[2:17:02] <%FuqBoiSlim> HEALING!
[2:17:07] <trickquestionz> So fun fact, Juggernaut isn't a mutant
[2:17:07] <cerazor01> Reggie wasting the TOP TIER
[2:17:07] <%The_Minotaur> This game also has a super sick Hulk, can't wait to see him
[2:17:15] <+kryedge> There's no room for jesus in this stages
[2:17:22] <supercjk333> flashbacks to the chip shop that had this game as an arcade
[2:17:34] <cerazor01> I'd buy this on a fucking Cab.
[2:17:38] <%The_Minotaur> Oh shit, I forgot it says the name of the super
[2:17:39] <kayamek> Juggernaut punch should loop like Rain's roundhouse
[2:17:40] <%The_Minotaur> So good
[2:17:45] <%jetjagger222> blackheart's stage
[2:17:47] <supercjk333> X
[2:17:50] <%LCLSmoothie> jim lee magneto lol
[2:17:50] <v960> this game looks mad good
[2:18:03] <WakeUpThrow> I forgot how much I loved hearing Jugg's AUUGH soundbyte
[2:18:11] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @kryedge
[2:18:19] <Sempu_kyaku> This makes me want that mvsc arcade1up cabinet
[2:18:22] <%shwaggerss> shwaggerss subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[2:18:29] <+kryedge> freaking blackheart is in this game?!?!!?
[2:18:41] <%The_Minotaur> Hell yeah Blackheart
[2:18:45] <cerazor01> I could've bought a 1up cabinet but I have no space.
[2:18:48] <%The_Minotaur> His normals throw projectiles, he's a dick
[2:19:01] <+kryedge> fucking edgelord, i love him so much
[2:19:02] <supercjk333> who else think this game was better then mvc1
[2:19:07] <%jetjagger222> captain america's theme sounds so megaman x-ish here
[2:19:08] <cerazor01> so im using the money for an Etokki stick
[2:19:20] <KaiserMario> Look at that Abigail V-Trigger 2
[2:19:20] <cerazor01> They used to sell 1up's at my local Aldi's
[2:19:24] <%The_Minotaur> ECLS
[2:19:26] <%The_Minotaur> ECKS
[2:19:28] <%The_Minotaur> Fuck
[2:19:29] <cerazor01> HEADCRUSH
[2:19:31] <cerazor01> X
[2:19:40] <supercjk333> X
[2:20:07] <%LCLSmoothie> back in my day, we called them gems and not stones!
[2:20:09] <cerazor01> can you turn off the Gems? Is that an option?
[2:20:12] <%jetjagger222> nope
[2:20:13] <cerazor01> oh, my question answered.
[2:20:15] <%The_Minotaur> The roster is small, but such good picks
[2:20:18] <+jiggy_snipe> hey this level
[2:20:27] <%kyh9> The Immortal Hulk is so good
[2:20:39] <%jetjagger222> hey i didn't know that
[2:20:42] <%LCLSmoothie> @kyh9 big agree
[2:21:00] <cerazor01> ECX
[2:21:06] <DerpioParty> Look at the water
[2:21:06] <+kryedge> That look dope
[2:21:07] <%jetjagger222> all the stages here look fucking cool
[2:21:10] <Dementedpenguin> Jesus that water
[2:21:14] <%kyh9> @LCLSmoothie Didn't think cosmic elements would make Hulk better but lo and behold
[2:21:15] <SomersaultJustice> wow this stage
[2:21:18] <mor3gan> look at those jiggle physics
[2:21:24] <supercjk333> immortal hulk was use in endgame right?
[2:21:28] <trickquestionz> Are they fighting on Niagra Falls?
[2:21:33] <%kyh9> Fighting game stages are an artform: they can be done well and they can be done poorly
[2:21:36] <%kyh9> This is done well
[2:21:37] <KaiserMario> This version of Hulk was based of the Pantheon saga I think, he was Prof Hulk at this point
[2:21:40] <%LCLSmoothie> @kyh9 and those alex ross' covers man i want to hang them on my walls
[2:21:44] <+kryedge> yooooooooooo
[2:21:47] <%The_Minotaur> I love this Hulk sprite so much, his haircut makes it imo
[2:21:47] <357Sneak> dnoWRAITH
[2:21:49] <cerazor01> didnt they put this stage in 3, but from a side perspective and references to ghosts and goblins?
[2:21:50] <coreybom> @kyh9 Never has hulk clotheslining a planet be both epic and horrifying.
[2:21:59] <v960> this hulk looks smarter
[2:22:03] <%kyh9> @LCLSmoothie I wasn't expecting some geiger-esque body-horror either, but it's a welcome surprise
[2:22:04] <$DoktahDoktah> You know the game is special when you get a double KO
[2:22:06] <DerpioParty> Yeah, Hulk's haircut in MvC3 always looked a bit dumb
[2:22:07] <%jetjagger222> hulk looks kinda like the guy from rammstein
[2:22:13] <huskarl_zap> hulk with the donkey kick
[2:22:23] <+kryedge> @jetjagger222 omfg it's true
[2:22:26] <+Doc1790> No Gems?
[2:22:26] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:22:28] <neroblind88> @v960 it is smarter hulk :)
[2:22:38] <%kyh9> @coreybom It's nice that they've managed to make him interesting again. Hulk is incredibly hit or miss
[2:22:43] <%LCLSmoothie> this version of hulk is prof hulk
[2:22:47] <coreybom> @v960 Hes a bit smarter. not a genius, but not a brute.
[2:22:52] <ThatGuyThere03> Oh is it supposed to be Smart Hulk?
[2:22:54] <%kyh9> I wonder if She-Hulk will fuck Cain Marko in the Disney+ show like she does in the comic
[2:22:55] <%FuqBoiSlim> Bengus always drew Hulk kinda bishi which I respect but im also slightly terrified by
[2:23:01] <DerpioParty> Oh man, I never noticed that Hulk damaged portrait before in the top corner
[2:23:16] <%FuqBoiSlim> Hulk could smash your car AND smash your girl now thats tuff
[2:23:19] <%The_Minotaur> BALCKHREAT
[2:23:20] <cerazor01> this Haircut makes me think of the Guy who replaced Hulk for a bit.
[2:23:30] <%kyh9> Blackheart is the weirdest pull on this roster.
[2:23:40] <%LCLSmoothie> @ThatGuyThere03 this hulk retains a bit of bruces intellgence so he can speak and hold himself back
[2:23:41] <+l3sovikk> Give 'em the gravity Squeeze!
[2:23:43] <WakeUpThrow> Shuma, though
[2:23:50] <Shardlab> Steve VS Lucky Jim
[2:23:51] <%jetjagger222> its a shame the thing never got in a capcom fighter
[2:23:53] <coreybom> @kyh9 Its such a fresh take. Its kinda insane how much a interesting take it is.
[2:23:54] <trickquestionz> Who is Blackheart a villain for, anyways?
[2:23:55] <Sempu_kyaku> Back when capcom could do whatever
[2:24:00] <supercjk333> shuma for doctor strange 2
[2:24:03] <%LCLSmoothie> @trickquestionz ghost rider
[2:24:05] <357Sneak> Hulk voted most likely to yell "Du Hast Mich" as an assist
[2:24:05] <coreybom> @trickquestionz Ghost rider.
[2:24:18] <neroblind88> peace out guys, have a great night BloodTrail
[2:24:22] <%jetjagger222> later
[2:24:24] <%LCLSmoothie> @neroblind88 night
[2:24:25] <cerazor01> I wonder Ghost Rider would've been wayyy too much work to turn into a Sprite for this game.
[2:24:30] <%The_Minotaur> I love how many of Fillia's moves in Skullgirls are a tribute to Shuma in this game
[2:24:31] <cerazor01> *if
[2:24:31] <+kryedge> someone please pick blackheart
[2:24:39] <coreybom> @trickquestionz He’s mephisto son.
[2:24:41] <%jetjagger222> cap's theme is so sick
[2:24:43] <%LCLSmoothie> @cerazor01 his fire head would be a nightmare to animate
[2:24:47] <KaiserMario> REMEMBER Blackheart from the Nic Cage Ghost Rider movie???
[2:24:53] <trickquestionz> Makes sense. Doesn't Ghost Rider have a villain called Scarecrow whose somehow way lamer than the DC version despite being an actual demon or something?
[2:24:53] <cerazor01> no
[2:24:58] <%jetjagger222> its around equally as patriotic as guile's theme
[2:25:03] <Meltgar> Did blackheart ever came back in a game?
[2:25:07] <cerazor01> Yeah. That's what I was thinking about Ghost Rider.
[2:25:14] <cerazor01> The flames coming out of him.
[2:25:14] <WakeUpThrow> Only in MvC2, iirc
[2:25:15] <%jetjagger222> @Meltgar MVC2
[2:25:19] <+kryedge> that hit backward wtf
[2:25:22] <+Doc1790> @KaiserMario I AM... LEGION.
[2:25:29] <+kryedge> now someone pick blackheart plz
[2:25:33] <+smikeye> dang cat's suit all torn up
[2:25:35] <%FuqBoiSlim> Imagine how tuff a penance stare super would be in this game tho 😳
[2:25:35] <%LCLSmoothie> love how in EMH cartoon, captain and wolverine were in the same squadron in WWII
[2:25:38] <supercjk333> blackheart was in Street fighter vs marvel and MVC2
[2:25:41] <coreybom> @kaisermario Dear god don’t remind me. That second movie isnt great but it ALOT better than that first one.
[2:25:42] <v960> wasnt blackheart in marvel vs street fighter too?
[2:25:42] <cerazor01> Blackheart is in MSH, MSH vs SF, and Marvel 2.
[2:25:42] <%jetjagger222> oh no tony
[2:26:15] <raihankb> LIGHT PUNCH
[2:26:16] <%jetjagger222> HIP HIP HURRAH
[2:26:20] <DerpioParty> Hip Hip Hurrah!
[2:26:21] <TeepPhoenix> I thought he was saying "THIS IS A BARRAGE"
[2:26:22] <%The_Minotaur> The BEAM
[2:26:23] <UltimateDomon> I can hear it
[2:26:23] <cerazor01> I love Iron Man's gundam references in the Marvel Games.

[2:28:11] <supercjk333> endgame would of been different with the proton cannon
[2:28:13] <mortalmanbaby> yo BH looks like dude from one punch

[2:28:24] <TheactualDiepod> Talk to em Black
[2:28:26] <cerazor01> I should download these stages for MUGEN, and then never touch it again.
[2:28:29] <%The_Minotaur> His heavy punches shoot demon projectiles
[2:28:36] <trickquestionz> "Tell your dad to give me back my wife!" -Peter, right now
[2:28:37] <Ragnorok64> I love that Blackheart has totally different shading
[2:28:37] <eddie_hedgehog> spiderman is so good
[2:28:37] <%jetjagger222> look at the parallax in the backgound
[2:28:45] <BobCarlosJunior> I never played this one, does spiderman plays the same as in MvC
[2:28:46] <Sempu_kyaku> @cerzor01 all this time i thought he was saying superior attack
[2:28:51] <KaiserMario> Wow! He looks exactly like in the Ghost Rider movie, such a faithful adaptation

[2:30:18] <%FuqBoiSlim> Even Greninja has a Maximum Frog
[2:30:19] <%jetjagger222> shuma is so sassy
[2:30:22] <cerazor01> isnt Akuma not banned in this game?
[2:30:32] <Meltgar> Wait, when did Shuma go pink? Wasn't Shuma green? (Or there's lore behind it?)
[2:30:42] <trickquestionz> Remember when Shuma had a story mode ending where he gave up on universal domination to be a Japanese porn star?
[2:30:49] <DerpioParty> Shuma is green, just not here
[2:30:50] <MonsieurHonHon> he WHAT
[2:30:50] <KaiserMario> Actually, I think the villain for Dr Strange 2 is supposed to be Nightmare, now that I think about it, not Shuma, unfortunatelly

[2:31:30] <%FuqBoiSlim> shuma kinda zesty here too GayPride
[2:31:35] <%jetjagger222> very
[2:31:35] <+Xero_J> How Capcom managed to make an eldritch eye with tentacles look so damn smug is one of the many mysteries of this series
[2:31:40] <coreybom> @kaisermario Well, shuma is essentially an old god, so that would have been little too big.
[2:32:09] <%FuqBoiSlim> I dont even read Dr strange I love Shuma so much
[2:32:12] <trickquestionz> I wish one of these games had given Multiple Man a try.
[2:32:14] <MonsieurHonHon> its crazy how expressive your characters can be when you dont let disney dictate what theyre supposed to do
[2:32:18] <KaiserMario> @coreybom Well, but so is Dormmamu and Nightmare, they are all gods in a way
[2:32:26] <357Sneak> lytONEMORE
[2:32:36] <jorniev> REALLY!?
[2:32:43] <+GenesisKnight> Yooo that's gonna be sick
[2:32:46] <yusefHD> it always bugs me whenever Juggernaut says his own name because you could tell they never recorded on the extra voice lines
[2:32:46] <coreybom> @kaisermario True.
[2:32:50] <%LCLSmoothie> apparently the sequel is more horror leaning
[2:32:59] <+Xero_J> Juggernaut does NOT need Super Armor
[2:33:08] <%The_Minotaur> God, ever stage in this game is so good looking
[2:33:20] <willg1222> the horror leaning thing was retracted once the director attached left the project
[2:33:23] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Not on this one yet, it'll probably be Nightmare, Marvel's version of Sandman
[2:33:31] <trickquestionz> Juggernaut isn't technically a mutant.
[2:33:34] <ofalconer> First time I saw Juggernaut in these games I lost my mind, I had no idea a sprite could be so big
[2:33:34] <%LCLSmoothie> @willg1222 ah, what a shame
[2:33:36] <+ShinobiPhoenix> is this Parsec or just Woolie vs Reggie?
[2:33:40] <TheactualDiepod> His suit is so tight
[2:33:45] <%FuqBoiSlim> Fightcade 2
[2:33:48] <jorniev> what
[2:33:49] <+smikeye> magic ruby
[2:33:50] <%kyh9> He's just some guy
[2:33:53] <+GenesisKnight> Human empowered by Cyterrak
[2:33:53] <%LCLSmoothie> powers from a god iirc
[2:33:53] <TeepPhoenix> Juggernaut is MAGIC
[2:33:58] <jorniev> OH RIGHT A DEMON
[2:33:59] <Ragnorok64> Why this Juggernaut caked up?
[2:34:00] <KaiserMario> A god from Dr Strange lore
[2:34:02] <%kyh9> Who's channeling power from some other dimension
[2:34:04] <MonsieurHonHon> woolie vs reggie but theyre using FightCade2 tonight
[2:34:05] <v960> civil war PogChamp
[2:34:06] <%LCLSmoothie> oh boy civil war
[2:34:07] <trickquestionz> Literally every adaptation makes him a mutant though lol
[2:34:08] <+Xero_J> There was that time he was a demon
[2:34:11] <jorniev> collosus got juggernauts powers once
[2:34:12] <%kyh9> Crimson Bands of Cytorrak or some shit
[2:34:20] <KaiserMario> Cytorrak, I think it's calld
[2:34:20] <yusefHD> Vaccines LUL
[2:34:21] <coreybom> @willg1222 Apparently they’re still going for it, since ol rami boy is directing it.
[2:34:26] <TeepPhoenix> In fact, Dr. Strange uses the Crimson Bands of Cytoraak, which is Cytoraak is the god Juggy gets his power from
[2:34:34] <trickquestionz> Shits a LOT* more stupid*
[2:34:37] <TeepPhoenix> Cytorrak is a god of destructions
[2:34:45] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> I thought he kept the emerald of Cytorak in his mouth
[2:34:54] <willg1222> its been months since ive heard anything, so that would be good
[2:34:58] <KaiserMario> @kyh9 Crimson band of Cytorrak is the Dr Strange spell, he uses to trap Thanos in the movie
[2:35:02] <godzookylives> the comic book fucking sucks
[2:35:07] <%kyh9> @TeepPhoenix Dr Strange is just making Bayonetta-style contracts with demons to use their powers
[2:35:13] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> *stone
[2:35:22] <%jetjagger222> in hades the shield moveset is just captain america
[2:35:23] <TeepPhoenix> I remember in the cartoon Juggy just chucked the ruby into space so noone else would steal his power
[2:35:29] <%LCLSmoothie> imagine a bayonetta style dr strange game
[2:35:31] <v960> they're not gonna play as dr.doom or thanos?
[2:35:35] <+ShinobiPhoenix> canon ending
[2:35:35] <%kyh9> @KaiserMario True. it's the Crimson Gem for Cyclops

[2:44:28] <%The_Minotaur> Shuma also has a life-stealing grab
[2:44:28] <%DarksideBluez> DOOM is worth it. ANITA is not. talking from experience
[2:44:29] <yusefHD> LUL LUL
[2:44:29] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I think Doom is even more broken than Thanos
[2:44:39] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Yeah, and stop gate keeping wool socks.
[2:44:45] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> They're not that hard to wash
[2:44:54] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Thanos is only broken because of his supers, but DOom is all around good
[2:45:02] <%jetjagger222> sassy
[2:45:09] <trickquestionz> Does Doom have hidden missiles this early?
[2:45:13] <WakeUpThrow> Doom is sick in every game he's in, honestly
[2:45:14] <eddie_hedgehog> yeah
[2:45:18] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Shuma is turn to stone with Time

[2:45:35] <+jiggy_snipe> is Psylocke's voice the same as Cammy's?
[2:45:40] <%DarksideBluez> but DOOM is really worth it in this game.
[2:45:41] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Psylocke splits into 3 with Power Gem
[2:45:45] <%DarksideBluez> ANITA is garbo
[2:45:48] <%jetjagger222> LOL
[2:45:52] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I remember this game SO well from childhood
[2:46:00] <trickquestionz> I love the implications of hidden missiles lol, like he hid them literally everywhere
[2:46:05] <eddie_hedgehog> is there push block in this?
[2:46:11] <chll0ne> any butcha-u fans in here
[2:46:15] <mazingmax> do not question Doom

[2:46:47] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I actually forgot what Blackheart was, but Magneto was Space GEm for his force field
[2:46:50] <chll0ne> Kreygasm
[2:46:53] <Hideow> I have read too much manga to know where this MU ends LUL
[2:46:54] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> I can't believe there's Psylocke artwork where you can't see 50% of her ass at all times macawOmg
[2:46:59] <TeepPhoenix> BH was Reality
[2:47:01] <%jetjagger222> who was that other artist with the superhero fan stuff
[2:47:07] <%LCLSmoothie> @ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots good
[2:47:15] <trickquestionz> Have any of the actual Fantastic Four ever been in one of these games or is it always Doom who represents that series?
[2:47:15] <TeepPhoenix> He got some abilites with his attacks
[2:47:16] <+ShinobiPhoenix> oh right, BH was Reality for Invisible
[2:47:35] <chll0ne> @trickquestionz just DOOM
[2:47:39] <Hideow> In mvc3 there is taskmaster,if I'm not mistake
[2:47:42] <%LCLSmoothie> @trickquestionz only doom and super skrull, i think human torch got cut in MVC3
[2:47:54] <chll0ne> oh ye super skrull
[2:48:03] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> @ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots LUL Yes?
[2:48:06] <TeepPhoenix> Super Skrull was mah boi in MVC3
[2:48:25] <+jiggy_snipe> I think Human Torch was causing ram issues in MvC3
[2:48:26] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I loved Super Skrull in MVC3
[2:48:32] <+TxukasaVersus> :<
[2:48:54] <TeepPhoenix> Maybe just play through the story mode so we can see Doom and Thanos. :P
[2:49:12] <Arek_1> @jiggy_snipe I remember that, too.
[2:49:14] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Oh jesus, not the BUBBLES ScaredyCat
[2:49:23] <TeepPhoenix> YES
[2:49:28] <TeepPhoenix> DOOM DEMANDS IT
[2:49:29] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I despised fighting against Spider-Man as a child
[2:49:32] <cerazor01> Play through Story Mode. DO IT. LUL
[2:49:38] <+ShinobiPhoenix> but I loved his music
[2:49:50] <TeepPhoenix> Even though Doom's stage is horrible

[2:50:15] <MidnightPacif1c> kay ohh Kreygasm

[2:52:47] <eddie_hedgehog> LP MP
[2:52:51] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Soul Gem vs Space Gem
[2:52:57] <trickquestionz> This fight should actually last less than a second
[2:53:08] <+Xero_J> This has to be one of my favorite versions of Cap's theme
[2:53:08] <cerazor01> 20 on the boy
[2:53:09] <Arek_1> L I G H T . P U N C H
[2:53:13] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Iron Man wearing his non-magnetic armor
[2:53:19] <cerazor01> wooden armour
[2:53:23] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Soul Gem for Iron Man
[2:53:24] <MonsieurHonHon> thing is, im pretty sure Iron man could have a suit that negate magnetism
[2:53:26] <TeepPhoenix> BUT! Tony knew he might face Magneto, so he de-magnetized his armor
[2:53:29] <eddie_hedgehog> X
[2:53:30] <%LCLSmoothie> @ShinobiPhoenix the power of writing!
[2:53:35] <%FuqBoiSlim> mY pOWeRs!!!!
[2:53:40] <eddie_hedgehog> omg seizure
[2:53:40] <yusefHD> I've always understood Magneto to be the master of magnetism but why the fuck is he so jacked
[2:53:50] <MonsieurHonHon> Because he lift
[2:53:53] <TeepPhoenix> He lift
[2:53:54] <trickquestionz> @MonsieurHonHon It's his wooden armor
[2:53:55] <Hideow> fatality epilepsy LUL
[2:53:59] <yusefHD> please don't say pumping iron
[2:54:00] <+ShinobiPhoenix> lifts Iron
[2:54:05] <%FuqBoiSlim> he moves the iron in his blood to constantly microflex his muscles
[2:54:06] <yusefHD> LUL
[2:54:08] <%DarksideBluez> WOOLIE out here bringing back my CHILDHOOD memories. DAMN U WOOLIE now I feel old.. I have mild carpal tunnel from playing these games so much. Had to wear wrist braces
[2:54:19] <%jetjagger222> wrong company tony
[2:54:20] <%LCLSmoothie> i love iron mans armor making abs on it what a asshole i love it
[2:54:22] <+Xero_J> You don't get to be a holocaust survivor by being not buff, I suppose
[2:54:23] <%afronooch> jokair
[2:54:34] <MonsieurHonHon> Is he always a holocaust survivor?
[2:54:35] <yusefHD> Iron Man's playing some fucking PS1 Rhythm games
[2:54:48] <Hillthugsta> no gems code
[2:54:49] <Arek_1> @FuqBoiSlim I knew there was some explanation, but that sounds rad, lol.
[2:54:53] <godzookylives> Magneto's head just got erased
[2:55:05] <+ShinobiPhoenix> @MonsieurHonHon except in weird other universe stuff
[2:55:09] <%LCLSmoothie> @MonsieurHonHon it was retconned in claremonts run on xmen
[2:55:11] <%FuqBoiSlim> @arek_1 oh no fam, I just made that up
[2:55:16] <+Xero_J> Why was Hulk's stage a merry-go-round
[2:55:21] <TeepPhoenix> In the main continuity, Magneto got rejuvinated so he's like 110 years old
[2:55:27] <chuulak> Nah that was not joker that was magneto bro
[2:55:30] <MidnightPacif1c> this is a dodge
[2:55:30] <trickquestionz> I know the movies he was in weren't very good but I always thought Ian McKellen was a great Magneto so seeing him jacked and muscular always seems weird to me.
[2:55:31] <Applecannon63> You know whats a bummer about Megaman X in infinite why couldn't he take someones power like how Megaman got Magneto's super?
[2:55:32] <Arek_1> @FuqBoiSlim I had a feeling. Still rad.
[2:55:35] <chuulak> Yessss juggz
[2:55:39] <chuulak> We out here
[2:55:39] <TeepPhoenix> So he can still be in the holocaust but still strong and young
[2:55:47] <MonsieurHonHon> Asking about comic lore is like asking "yo hit me with some dumb shit"
[2:56:01] <%LCLSmoothie> @MonsieurHonHon and whats why i love it
[2:56:11] <MonsieurHonHon> Thats very fair and I like jhearing about it too
[2:56:13] <%DarksideBluez> JUGGS and HULK are really op in this game. They also have a lot of range if you know how to use them. WE BANNED them in my house.
[2:56:21] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> There's no such thing as comic books, chat
[2:56:22] <TeepPhoenix> And those of us who know comic lore are like "we love telling you about all this dumb shit, we eat it up"
[2:56:25] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Juggernaut never did get anything but ONE Super
[2:56:25] <MonsieurHonHon> But everytime its like "what the fuck did this guy just say?"
[2:56:30] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Are you talking about manga?
[2:56:46] <DerpioParty> HIP HIP HOORAH
[2:56:47] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Wolverine got like 12 supers
[2:56:51] <chuulak> @buttstuff_n_coffeepots we all thought those 2 sucked when we were kids lol I hated it cuz I used juggernaut
[2:56:53] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Juggernaut got ONE
[2:56:54] <TeepPhoenix> Like, once the Hulk turned into the Horseman of the Apocalypse and beat the shit out of Juggernaut
[2:56:55] <MonsieurHonHon> WEAPONS ECHS
[2:56:58] <%DarksideBluez> I USED to argue on COMICVINE
[2:57:02] <odiemikes> you remember that time in the x-men juggernaught taught at xaviers academy
[2:57:03] <%LCLSmoothie> hot take i like wolverines brown suit more
[2:57:06] <MonsieurHonHon> Salty rematch
[2:57:11] <MonsieurHonHon> Amene toi Woolie
[2:57:15] <chuulak> Spider man and wolverine were the “good ones” in our young minds
[2:57:32] <%DarksideBluez> Cyclops was RIGHT
[2:57:37] <yusefHD> LUL for fun
[2:57:52] <eddie_hedgehog> omg
[2:57:52] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:57:56] <Arek_1> @LCLSmoothie Pretty cool on that take. That one is dope.
[2:57:58] <odiemikes> in my plums
[2:58:05] <%LCLSmoothie> david vs goliath match up
[2:58:17] <%DarksideBluez> I will argue with every COMIC book nerd. CYCLOPS was riight
[2:58:23] <%ChoculaUltra> he's recently gone back to the brown costume too which is neat
[2:58:37] <+ShinobiPhoenix> it's also weird this game has no grapplers
[2:58:40] <%LCLSmoothie> @ChoculaUltra the correct choice
[2:58:44] <TeepPhoenix> I liked it when Cyclops went Dark Phoenix in Avengers vs. X-Men,
[2:58:47] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Hulk has one command grab you can block
[2:58:47] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[2:58:48] <eddie_hedgehog> can i play reggie?
[2:58:48] <MonsieurHonHon> Is Hulk not a grappler?
[2:58:50] <+Creggamonsta> what was cylops right about?
[2:58:57] <%FuqBoiSlim> EVERYTHING L
[2:59:00] <MonsieurHonHon> @ShinobiPhoenix wild
[2:59:01] <Hillthugsta> @choculaultra back to the 80s huh?
[2:59:01] <+Creggamonsta> lol
[2:59:02] <trickquestionz> Cyclops is honestly right about the mutant politics stuff but he's also a huge chode just as a person.
[2:59:09] <yusefHD> Someone said echs
[2:59:12] <%ChoculaUltra> Mutants needing to stop trying to cater to humans and instead live apart from them.
[2:59:13] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> LAST ONE!!!
[2:59:16] <357Sneak> FBtouchdown GOOD
[2:59:18] <%LCLSmoothie> @Hillthugsta late 70s early 80s
[2:59:19] <Applecannon63> Is Wolverine's divekick in the same calibur as Dr Doom's Footdive?
[2:59:23] <%ChoculaUltra> current X-Men run is wild wild.
[2:59:24] <chuulak> Yo was juggernauts walk animation different in ps1???
[2:59:30] <%DarksideBluez> He is not a chode. He was protecting his people
[2:59:40] <MonsieurHonHon> I mean those were there because they were basically debug tools so eh
[2:59:45] <yusefHD> would you say that those days are in the Futures Past
[2:59:50] <odiemikes> ooh
[3:00:04] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> I go DIP in the SWITCH
[3:00:04] <TeepPhoenix> sorry
[3:00:16] <+hojynn> luv you woolie
[3:00:20] <%DarksideBluez> i hate how CIVIL WAR was butchered in Capt america 3
[3:00:28] <Applecannon63> and why is there two Wolverines?
[3:00:30] <eddie_hedgehog> houston
[3:00:36] <Arek_1> @Applecannon63 I don't think so. In fact, it goes straight downward (in this one, I think).
[3:00:37] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I loved X-Men COTA but Marvel Super Heroes was my childhood
[3:00:37] <Hideow> You can see the ping,by pressing backspace
[3:00:39] <Hillthugsta> @lclsmoothie the brown look fits his character better
[3:00:45] <yusefHD> and the other ones boneless
[3:00:47] <+Dova573> Houston boys represent
[3:01:00] <MidnightPacif1c> boneclaw is ready
[3:01:13] <Aussie_Manny> WEB BALL
[3:01:14] <trickquestionz> Is this the game that has Venom in it as a Spidey clone?
[3:01:15] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Wolverine had better and more supers, Boneverine was physically stronger and tougher
[3:01:23] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> LUL you tried, @DarksideBluez
[3:01:30] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I think faster too
[3:01:40] <%DarksideBluez> naw i'm just venting not trynna get an arguemnet

[3:03:07] <Applecannon63> But the Reality Stones in Infinite is just the pandorasgemes all over again
[3:03:18] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I forgot how much everyone in the game just had BANGER songs
[3:03:21] <Applecannon63> *Infinity Stones
[3:03:30] <yusefHD> look at those unviable ass eating bones in the background
[3:03:34] <%jetjagger222> infinity stones still sound wrong to me, its always been gems
[3:03:46] <Aussie_Manny> HEADCRUSH
[3:03:46] <odiemikes> unviable for eating ass?
[3:03:55] <%FuqBoiSlim> *Infinity Precious Metals
[3:03:58] <+ShinobiPhoenix> use Space Gem before Juggernaut gets it
[3:04:03] <%LCLSmoothie> @jetjagger222 everyone looks at me like im crazy when i say gems too
[3:04:04] <MonsieurHonHon> Infinity Minerals
[3:04:06] <yusefHD> cmonBruh cmonBruh
[3:04:13] <%DarksideBluez> the thing about JUGGS is that if CYTTORAK actually gave him all the power he possibly could JUGGS would curbstomp the entire Marvel universe. It would take pre retcon Beyonder to take him out
[3:04:37] <%jetjagger222> member when spidey beat juggenaut by luring him into wet cement

[3:06:36] <%jetjagger222> new gods > inhumans
[3:06:38] <%kyh9> Kamala is honestly the decent Inhumans
[3:06:47] <%kyh9> *only
[3:06:49] <+ShinobiPhoenix> no love for Crystal?
[3:06:50] <Applecannon63> Earth X???
[3:07:02] <%ChoculaUltra> wasn't there that one-off Marvel story where Black Bolt said a full sentence and like glassed half the planet?
[3:07:06] <+KamiFree_> I really do love Black Bolt
[3:07:09] <%kyh9> @ShinobiPhoenix QUICKSILVER, PLEASE COME BACK FOR ME AND YOUR DAUGHTER
[3:07:10] <+Dova573> Ill be cool with inhumans if marvel would not push them as mutant replacements
[3:07:17] <%kyh9> Crystal is tolerable, but not 'good'
[3:07:22] <%DarksideBluez> inhumans tv show was turrible
[3:07:23] <+sinistersally> I didn't come here to hear you wisper, I WANT TO HEAR YOU SCREAM!!!
[3:07:27] <@Menitta> black bolt is cool
[3:07:30] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Crystal who also dated Jonny Storm
[3:07:31] <Aussie_Manny> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
[3:07:34] <%LCLSmoothie> crystal is cool too
[3:07:38] <%jetjagger222> didn't the tv show have ramsay bolton in it
[3:07:43] <+Creggamonsta> black bolt is very cool
[3:07:43] <eddie_hedgehog> that was sick
[3:07:47] <%kyh9> Inhumans are just a power-set. I don't think I've enjoyed a single Inhumans storyline
[3:07:51] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> SO not Lockjaw? doodSad doodSad doodSad
[3:07:52] <%ChoculaUltra> Ramsay was Maximus! Excellent casting choice.
[3:07:56] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I first learned of the Inhumans becasuee of teh Fantastic Four 90s cartoon
[3:07:56] <$RunningNGunning> Girls are watching
[3:07:59] <+JustToWatch> wasn't the black bolt in world war hulk actually an andriod?
[3:08:00] <%kyh9> Not even Lockjaw @ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots
[3:08:04] <%kyh9> Actuall
[3:08:05] <eddie_hedgehog> 3 now baby
[3:08:09] <%kyh9> Isn't Lockjaw living with kamala?
[3:08:11] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> doodSad doodSad doodSad
[3:08:17] <%LCLSmoothie> i heard the jenkins inhumans run is good
[3:08:24] <%FuqBoiSlim> they only pushed inhumans as mutant replacement was because Ike Perlmutter didn't want Fox see even a fucking cent of their movie money
[3:08:33] <%DarksideBluez> inhumans leave a lot to be desired
[3:08:34] <%kyh9> @ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots Is Lockjaw living with Kamala? I'll extend good-boy status if that's true
[3:08:43] <%jetjagger222> who else put pencils between their fingers and pretend to be wolverine
[3:09:02] <%LCLSmoothie> @jetjagger222 guility
[3:09:03] <MonsieurHonHon> gg no idea how to use the gems
[3:09:04] <MonsieurHonHon> :(
[3:09:05] <%DarksideBluez> @jetjagger222 butter knives
[3:09:10] <Aussie_Manny> @jetjagger222 YEYEYEYE!
[3:09:11] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Sorry, @kyh9 no idea. Not up to date at all.
[3:09:11] <%FuqBoiSlim> @jetjagger222 I used lincoln logs instead of pencils
[3:09:18] <MonsieurHonHon> but I got a final justice justice finish so im good
[3:09:22] <%jetjagger222> @DarksideBluez LUL
[3:09:24] <%kyh9> @ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots I'll say Lockjaw is okay since he's just a dog
[3:09:26] <%LCLSmoothie> thats why i like comics, you can mess around with the characters and setting with new intresting ideas
[3:09:33] <badjab326> Have you tried Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3?
[3:09:37] <%DarksideBluez> i did butter knives because it looked better
[3:09:52] <badjab326> Its the best looking Marvel Game in a while
[3:10:01] <%jetjagger222> oh yeah is captain universe still a thing in the comics
[3:10:02] <eddie_hedgehog> imma let ppl play
[3:10:04] <%DarksideBluez> i also threw hangers at ppl because they were my batarans
[3:10:06] <eddie_hedgehog> can i play reggie?
[3:10:10] <%DarksideBluez> batarangs*
[3:10:12] <BabyNaBackbrace> You guys see this game FOOTSIES just came out?
[3:10:13] <MonsieurHonHon> Can we go twice if no one is stepping up?
[3:10:20] <%jetjagger222> i had the captain universe spider man trading card
[3:10:25] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> @kyh9 Is doggo therefore good. I too, follow this logic SeemsGood SeemsGood SeemsGood
[3:10:28] <%LCLSmoothie> @badjab326 i love how they took more from the comics in that game
[3:10:43] <badjab326> ^same! its honestly a love letter to Marvel fans
[3:10:57] <Arek_1> From the colors in MvC3, I know that Hulk and X-23 once had Captain Universe's powers.
[3:11:14] <eddie_hedgehog> dude his web swing is so late
[3:11:15] <%LCLSmoothie> @badjab326 it was a okay game but it was carrried by how much marvel stuff they pulled perfectly
[3:11:17] <eddie_hedgehog> it takes foreveeer
[3:11:18] <%DarksideBluez> will we get a MvC5?
[3:11:23] <%kyh9> The biggest issue with the Inhumans for me is that they are just never doing anything I care about. Maybe that's just me but very few of their stories have an interesting premise for me
[3:11:36] <dragonslayingronin> That was a 10/10 smear we paused on
[3:11:44] <MonsieurHonHon> I ojnly know of blackbolt and of the show
[3:11:44] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Doesn't have his mobility from later games
[3:11:45] <%DarksideBluez> @kyh9 Sentry has the same problem
[3:11:49] <MonsieurHonHon> and the show looked like absolute dogshit
[3:11:52] <%jetjagger222> its actually brilliant design for hulk to be weird to use; he's both fast and strong but finds it hard to control his power
[3:12:12] <MonsieurHonHon> Ah yes, one of those "Its a feature" situation
[3:12:12] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1310937719246385153?s=19
[3:12:17] <badjab326> @LCLSmoothie totally agree
[3:12:25] <%kyh9> @DarksideBluez Exactly. It's the sort of thing where it feels like it's designed to be a side-character or side-group forever because there's just nothing to ground it to a human pathos
[3:12:44] <%DarksideBluez> @kyh9 forever in the friendzone lulzzz
[3:12:48] <%jetjagger222> demons
[3:12:51] <badjab326> I also think Avengers has a ton of potential but was released wayyy too early
[3:12:53] <%FuqBoiSlim> do you remember that one hulk cartoon that would air on Disney XD? Where he had his own hulk avengers or something?
[3:12:56] <TeepPhoenix> Yeah, this is Blackhearts stage
[3:12:57] <%kyh9> Like, it reminds me of the issue with the Star Wars Prequels' characters feeling very sterile and inhuman (lol)
[3:13:00] <badjab326> Covid probably botched development
[3:13:04] <TeepPhoenix> Agents of SMASH, yeah
[3:13:10] <%FuqBoiSlim> That show had some of the worst editing I ever saw in a cartoon man I swear
[3:13:14] <Applecannon63> Man Ryu and Hulk have great chemistry in infinite such a shame they could've made the story mode into arcades with mandatory team types
[3:13:15] <%LCLSmoothie> and Avengers EMH, i loved that show
[3:13:23] <%FuqBoiSlim> like 10 different cuts in one scene
[3:13:25] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Good ol' 90's Hulk
[3:13:27] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> So handsome
[3:13:32] <TeepPhoenix> It had Hulk, Red Hulk, Rick Jones, She-Hulk, and Skarr
[3:13:38] <%jetjagger222> those guys in the background are having one hell of a time
[3:13:40] <%LCLSmoothie> hulk has a better hair cut than me
[3:13:47] <+ShinobiPhoenix> my fanfiction sequel/expansion to this game as a child added Venom, Doc Ock, Gladiator, Jean Grey, Ghost Rider, Red Skull based on Captain America and the Avengers, Professor X in a suit,
[3:13:56] <TeepPhoenix> This Hulk could rock a pinstriped suit in Vega
[3:14:00] <TeepPhoenix> Er, Vegas
[3:14:12] <MonsieurHonHon> This hulk could rock my bed Kappa
[3:14:12] <Hillthugsta> @jetjagger222 not really...
[3:14:22] <%DarksideBluez> I think the only way to remedy these characters from their boring story lines is to just make them villains.
[3:14:23] <%FuqBoiSlim> imagining Hulk in a giant zoot suit rn
[3:14:24] <TeepPhoenix> And The Leader established he was hung like a Brahma Bull
[3:14:27] <yusefHD> let's rock baby
[3:14:37] <KUYAmoPESh> A lot of burning Kermit the frog in the BG lol
[3:14:49] <%jetjagger222> @KUYAmoPESh LUL
[3:14:53] <Applecannon63> I know Professor Ryu was memey in infinite but that was actually unique change than being a hobo fighter
[3:14:55] <eddie_hedgehog> LMAO
[3:14:56] <Hillthugsta> @kuyamopesh nightmare fuel
[3:14:56] <eddie_hedgehog> WUT
[3:14:57] <+ShinobiPhoenix> oh yeah, it was jsut Doc Ock for Spider-Man
[3:14:58] <yusefHD> BabyRage BabyRage BabyRage
[3:14:59] <BabyNaBackbrace> @FuqBoiSlim that's Mr. Fix It
[3:15:03] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I wish I still had my notes for my games
[3:15:06] <eddie_hedgehog> marvel tho
[3:15:10] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> JOE Fixit
[3:15:15] <MonsieurHonHon> But Ryu is hoo fighter to his core
[3:15:17] <%DarksideBluez> Sentry and the Inhumans join up together and become villians
[3:15:18] <TeepPhoenix> one of the U-Foes blew his pants off, and the Leader said like "DAMN, you're gonna give everyone an inferiority complex!"
[3:15:19] <%LCLSmoothie> marvel > having childern
[3:15:19] <MonsieurHonHon> hobo*
[3:15:24] <+ShinobiPhoenix> like why isn't Doc Ock in a Capcom
[3:15:34] <eddie_hedgehog> go back to your baby
[3:15:37] <Applecannon63> Ryu being a profressor so interesting tho
[3:15:40] <%jetjagger222> member when she-hulk and juggernaut fucked and destroyed the room
[3:15:47] <MonsieurHonHon> I mean idk I havent seen shit from Infinite
[3:15:48] <badjab326> Doc Ock should have been in MvC3
[3:15:51] <MonsieurHonHon> It might be
[3:15:57] <Applecannon63> I mean he can still be a hobo
[3:16:14] <Applecannon63> a traveling hobo teacher
[3:16:34] <%DarksideBluez> Doc could be mapped over Omega red
[3:16:37] <Ragnorok64> Octopiss?
[3:16:38] <%LCLSmoothie> japan and tentcales go hand to hand
[3:16:38] <@Menitta> yo he really would
[3:16:40] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> It pissed me off that Hobo Ryu wasn't the default skin in 5
[3:16:42] <%Reverend_Roscoe> baby's good
[3:16:53] <MonsieurHonHon> Doc ock spiderman as an alternate kinda like bone wolverine and normal wolverine
[3:16:55] <lbrownthedestroyer> Magneto did nothing wrong
[3:16:55] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Such a good evolution
[3:16:56] <%kyh9> Chat makes MVC4 dream roster, I'll start: Jim Lee Jubilee, Apocalypse and Fraccion Hawkeye
[3:16:58] <huskarl_zap> JUGGERNAUT PUNCH
[3:17:06] <Mr_November> 10 raiders from Mr_November have joined! 
[3:17:06] <huskarl_zap> Punisher
[3:17:11] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Red Skull should have totally be in, my mugen idea based him on his Captain America and the Avengers Mecha Skull version
[3:17:17] <%jetjagger222> asura, edward falcon, lynn kurosawa
[3:17:21] <%LCLSmoothie> well doc ock was in a MVC game, there was a supeior spider man skin in MVCI
[3:17:25] <%DarksideBluez> I will always maintain that MAGNETO is just suffering from PTSD
[3:17:25] <eddie_hedgehog> YES
[3:17:27] <Hillthugsta> Sandman would be a better marvel character
[3:17:29] <Mr_November> enjoy kiddos
[3:17:30] <eddie_hedgehog> i wanna play reggie
[3:17:44] <+Dova573> My controller fell asleep lol
[3:17:49] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> I thought that was the steel spider outdit from Cicil War, @LCLSmoothie
[3:17:52] <%jetjagger222> nightcrawler would be cool
[3:17:54] <MonsieurHonHon> Magneto's motivation are great. In some storyline hes barely a villain
[3:17:55] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> *Civil
[3:17:57] <MonsieurHonHon> Kinda like Doom
[3:18:13] <+jiggy_snipe> I would like Ryu from BoF
[3:18:29] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I had the idea of adding Gladiator vs Juggernaut because of the X-Men cartoon when Gladiator fucked Juggernaut up
[3:18:34] <Applecannon63> you mean Homodemongenius
[3:18:37] <%jetjagger222> i can't unsee the burning kermits
[3:18:39] <%DarksideBluez> I MEAN seriously. Magneto is a holocaust survivor who ends up being hated by America because he was born different. Like the man can't get no breaks
[3:18:48] <Arek_1> @jetjagger222 LUL
[3:18:49] <+Creggamonsta> i also seek kermets now
[3:18:57] <badjab326> Anybody know how to set a rom folder for Fightcade 2?
[3:18:58] <%DarksideBluez> you expect him not to be angry?
[3:18:59] <%kyh9> Anyone keeping up with X of Swords? We DBZ Tournament Arc now
[3:19:00] <%eriksdrums> I miss being able to say that to friends. But if you're down, I'll be by in like... half a year. Don't wait up
[3:19:04] <%LCLSmoothie> @ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots maybe in base game i havent seen MVCI in a cool moment but he had it as DLC costume
[3:19:11] <MonsieurHonHon> I think some of my favorite moments with Magneto was in Marvel Zombies where he just floats around shitting on every infected super aruond him, shit was cash money
[3:19:16] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I have mandala effect, couldn't Hulk activate Hulk Crush in the air?
[3:19:17] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:19:43] <armchairmaster_> Why does wolvie need manicures?
[3:19:54] <MonsieurHonHon> Unrelated but Mandela effect is a weird name for "I remembered wrong"
[3:19:55] <%kyh9> @LCLSmoothie Best Magneto moment is when he becomes a good guy after finding out Kitty is Jewish
[3:20:09] <Applecannon63> Why couldn't Megaman X just have Zero's Max charge shot cancel follow up combos?
[3:20:38] <%DarksideBluez> Magneto murdering Wolvie will always be iconic to me
[3:20:43] <eddie_hedgehog> i think c.hk and super works
[3:20:44] <%LCLSmoothie> @kyh9 thats why magneto is one of my favorties
[3:20:46] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> @ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots Oh, yer right, it just has iron spider color scheme
[3:21:03] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Also I meant Iron spider
[3:21:16] <%kyh9> @LCLSmoothie My other favorite moment is when he, Charles and Moira have a big orgy off-screen. It totally happened, even if they never say so in the comics
[3:21:17] <TeepPhoenix> Hehe
[3:21:39] <%LCLSmoothie> @kyh9 "lets make more mutants"
[3:21:43] <@Menitta> I do anticipate a FFS for Infinite
[3:21:48] <Applecannon63> wasn't it SFxT?
[3:21:59] <+jiggy_snipe> both games had gems
[3:22:01] <Applecannon63> with the pandora gems?
[3:22:11] <%kyh9> @LCLSmoothie Lmao, Mutants as a sex cult is the kindest send-up to Chris "Horny on Main" Claremont you could ever do
[3:22:20] <+jiggy_snipe> SFxT implementation was really bad and actually killed the hype for the game before it came out
[3:22:26] <+Dova573> Max keeps and the gang keeping mvci alive
[3:22:32] <dragonslayingronin> I'm going to scream into the moon every night I remember jedah came back looking so good in a game that did so poorly.
[3:22:42] <+Dova573> I will defend MVCIs gameplay all DAY
[3:22:50] <%kyh9> @LCLSmoothie Also, Magneto had some pretty broken moments when he triple-techs the Cotati during Empyre
[3:22:59] <%FuqBoiSlim> OMEGALUL N OMEGALUL
[3:23:00] <+Dova573> Jedah was so much fun
[3:23:00] <badjab326> Why is FC2 such a pain when FC1 was so easy?
[3:23:18] <Applecannon63> At least Smash had fun with giving characters custom ver of movesets
[3:23:19] <+Dova573> Jedah Venom was such a fun team
[3:23:20] <%LCLSmoothie> @kyh9 mutants having a sex postive culture makes sense haha loving how theyre handling krakoa culture
[3:23:38] <%LCLSmoothie> i need to hop back on the xmen comics asap
[3:23:39] <dragonslayingronin> It's not fair I just want darkstalkers 4 but capcom fighting division keeps fucking up.
[3:23:41] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @WoolieVersus I'm still getting used to my new fightstick but I'm so thankful that my fingers arent being destroyed
[3:23:42] <@Menitta> I was watching the fisticuffs for X Tekken last night. that game is wack
[3:24:11] <+mr_miyagucci> X tekken has better footises than V
[3:24:12] <Arek_1> @badjab326 Conversely, I just got into Fightcade 2 recently. Can't bother to figure out Fightcade 1.
[3:24:20] <Applecannon63> such a shame Ultimate didn't bring back custom moves for all character accept for the mii fighters
[3:24:26] <+jiggy_snipe> Spiderman's theme is the most remixed I think after Ryu SF2
[3:24:36] <%kyh9> @LCLSmoothie All Xmen rule34 is now canon. But yeah, them being this bohemian utopian culture is interesting. It's funny because I think it does a good job of avoiding the issue of Inhumans or Eternals by having persistent relationships with the normal world
[3:24:40] <@Menitta> oh my god
[3:24:41] <%jetjagger222> wind's howling
[3:24:44] <eddie_hedgehog> lmaoo
[3:24:46] <eddie_hedgehog> GGs
[3:24:53] <%Malik1002> one for jj
[3:25:01] <%kyh9> I wonder who's going to die in X of Swords tho
[3:25:05] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> JUST ONE doodBait
[3:25:08] <@Menitta> X Tekken's footsies was just SF4
[3:25:15] <eddie_hedgehog> that was really fun bros
[3:25:20] <+mr_miyagucci> true
[3:25:21] <%Lion_kun> Paige just oneshot the first DS3 boss, woolz!
[3:25:29] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> What's baby's crying?
[3:25:43] <+mr_miyagucci> but it also had magic series and was generally more fun... eventually
[3:25:48] <eddie_hedgehog> its a joke from a skit from dave chapelles show
[3:26:02] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Thanks for the FLESH
[3:26:12] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Oh, the one about the guy working at McDonalds?
[3:26:18] <+mr_miyagucci> launch X tekken was trash though
[3:26:18] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:26:18] <eddie_hedgehog> lmao YEAH
[3:26:33] <Applecannon63> I can't believe Dan even though he didn't join SFxT he had Mishimas EWF in Omega mode SF4
[3:26:39] <eddie_hedgehog> LMAO
[3:26:40] <+ShinobiPhoenix> command grab
[3:27:00] <%DarksideBluez> WOOLIE WE NEED A DEVIL MAY CRY GAME WITH VERGIL AS THE MAIN CHARACTER
[3:27:18] <+mr_miyagucci> wtf i never messed with omega mode but that sounds wild
[3:27:20] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I mean canon, Captain America would stand NO chances against Shuma-Gorath
[3:27:36] <+gitgouda> god i missed this game
[3:27:43] <%LCLSmoothie> @ShinobiPhoenix the power of america will help him
[3:27:55] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I can't wait to see Sam Raimi's version of Shuma Gorath in Doctor Strange 2
[3:28:05] <Applecannon63> Dan also Ryo's Zanretsuken
[3:28:22] <+ShinobiPhoenix> you can;t talk about Madnessa nd it's not about Shuma Gorath
[3:28:31] <%DarksideBluez> SHUMA GORATH inside of his realm would give White crown phoenix a run for her money
[3:28:34] <+Dova573> I got bodied
[3:28:46] <+Dova573> That comand grab is so fast
[3:28:55] <+mr_miyagucci> i heard about the ryo punches but never about EWGF
[3:29:08] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I mean Doctor Strange and Scarlet Witch vs Shuma Gorath will be great
[3:29:20] <%DarksideBluez> yes but they would need more help
[3:29:21] <+mr_miyagucci> I'm glad he has them in V
[3:29:48] <Applecannon63> its makes me wonder if Dan in SFV will have EWF again or Akira Yuki?
[3:29:49] <eddie_hedgehog> lion king stage
[3:29:58] <Applecannon63> *Akira Kazama
[3:30:00] <DerpioParty> HIP HIP HOORAH
[3:30:17] <%DarksideBluez> Mephisto, Dr Strange, and Scarlet witch vs Shuma Gorath would be a really good match
[3:30:17] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Speaking of space, would you be willing to become a mars colonist, @WoolieVersus ?
[3:30:50] <Applecannon63> Woolie being part of Sieg Zeon?
[3:30:57] <+mr_miyagucci> if those wild taunt combos are anything to go by dan will at least be a real boy
[3:31:07] <badjab326> My FC2 doesnt recognize my MSH rom that worked on mame and FC1 :(
[3:31:18] <+mr_miyagucci> granted combos are not everything but still
[3:31:22] <+Dova573> Any way I know the probability of an mvci night is low, I still hope it happens because all the bad stuff about aside is still really fun vs game
[3:31:22] <eddie_hedgehog> @badjab326 yeah its a different set
[3:31:30] <armchairmaster_> @applecannon63 you mean Sieg Nerds? Federation all the way
[3:31:32] <badjab326> laaaaaaaaame
[3:31:35] <+ShinobiPhoenix> Fatal Attractions 2: Electric Boogaloo
[3:32:27] <Applecannon63> hey at least the red comet is fucking badass looking
[3:32:38] <%jetjagger222> you mean the salmon comety
[3:32:48] <%jetjagger222> at least in the original
[3:32:49] <+ShinobiPhoenix> and Magneto rips out his skeleton again
[3:32:57] <357Sneak> lovin the evolution hustle, Woolie
[3:33:17] <+Doc1790> atozSailorz

[3:35:02] <%DarksideBluez> GET A BACKPACK
[3:35:09] <+ShinobiPhoenix> I wonder why they chose Psylocke in this game instead of another main female from Infinity Gaunlet
[3:35:13] <+Dova573> The only reason I lost to Irl dante in a sfv set its I was handicapped with a stick
[3:35:17] <%jetjagger222> sprite reuse
[3:35:19] <%DarksideBluez> Psylocke is sexy
[3:35:22] <+Dova573> ' because
[3:35:26] <%LCLSmoothie> @Dova573 capcom wanted a hot lady in the roster
[3:35:32] <%DarksideBluez> ^
[3:35:36] <%DarksideBluez> sex sells
[3:35:39] <+ShinobiPhoenix> was there no main female heroes involved in INfinity Gauntlet

[0:07:11] <+kinmarik> yo the better capcom fighter of that year
[0:07:11] <subjectg> why does berserker go berserk
[0:07:14] <chaos2frozen> People think gacha hell is from the low rates of rolling the characters, while that is true, the real hell is the grind
[0:07:21] <Hellvis92> tha archer class is really made of archers
[0:07:25] <maskedmook> berser-car
[0:07:27] <GothicLolitaAngel> I say both @chaos2frozen

[0:07:53] <+kinmarik> people die when they are
[0:07:57] <am_omega> A good one. made by Eighting.

[0:08:02] <+cherryceecee> cu is best boy
[0:08:04] <+kaiber132> TPFufun
[0:08:09] <+Underachiever_Mako> oh btw if you want to watch HF, leave rn
[0:08:16] <maskedmook> cu is best mutt
[0:08:18] <chaos2frozen> @GothicLolitaAngel sometimes I definitely wish I could buy away my problems lol
[0:08:20] <+Underachiever_Mako> it has a massive spoiler from it
[0:08:24] <+kinmarik> Woolie vs FUC
[0:08:28] <nikolatesla_iii> Woolie, i am so sorry that you’re gonna have to deal with the Fate community
[0:08:37] <TheSaltminer> The team that made Nier worked with Capcom on a fighting game, and gave us this
[0:08:37] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:08:45] <Hellvis92> His Gay Bulge is unavoidable! *Is instantly avoided*
[0:08:49] <+KgKid51> RaccAttack FBBlock hggBanger
[0:08:54] <laserbeaming> Is this a good game? Or did this came from The Barrel:tm:
[0:08:55] <GothicLolitaAngel> I wanted to see HF but there are no theaters that are playing it but in NJ rip
[0:09:00] <+kamig92> I hope @WoolieVersus plays the video of that Lancer player winning SBO and crying, it's amazing
[0:09:02] <subjectg> “So you dodged my undodgeable blow”
[0:09:02] <+alphonseisbest> @TheSaltminer FUCK OFF NO WAY :o
[0:09:03] <am_omega> Mako its fine, this came out I think in response to the 2006 DEEN anime so it has spoilers of all routes.
[0:09:06] <+Underachiever_Mako> F
[0:09:07] <Tr1pkT12> Drove and 1 and a half to see it
[0:09:09] <+spartan_ermine> Woolie Madden berserker class servant madness enhancement EX can only internalize logic as fighting game terminology
[0:09:11] <Tr1pkT12> Was kinda worth
[0:09:13] <+Underachiever_Mako> oh true
[0:09:18] <+D00msDayDan> time for cringelords to demand that woolie get into fate again
[0:09:23] <TheSaltminer> @alphonseisbest this is a Cavia game, look it up
[0:09:23] <+Underachiever_Mako> yeah in general it’s just spoilery yeah
[0:09:24] <phatmac16> Woolie would be berserker
[0:09:27] <+kinmarik> the fate community seems pretty chill. they like fate and that's fine
[0:09:27] <anarchistPastry> VLC MEDIA PLAYER
[0:09:31] <am_omega> Except for one character.
[0:09:31] <%Pigg1yJuffs> WOOLIE HAS FALLEN DOWN THE HOLE! YES!
[0:09:34] <brunoberserk> but the eternal question ... shiki can kill servants ???
[0:09:35] <+KgKid51> catJAM
[0:09:37] <Tr1pkT12> Woolie would definitely be a Berserker Class
[0:09:39] <am_omega> A certain assassin.
[0:09:58] <%GalacticaPhanto> @thesaltminer I mean Yoko Taro would respectfully look at everyone's ass, especially Cu
[0:09:59] <Monkeyweed21> Woolie you know this is a mistake
[0:10:00] <Solidnick18> hello
[0:10:04] <TheSaltminer> So top tier in this game was Archer Lancer and Rider, right?
[0:10:06] <Jashter18> Pat would probably be a Lancer
[0:10:06] <+Devil_IV_War> doodSad
[0:10:08] <phatmac16> Fan art of Woolie as Herc would be sick
[0:10:10] <+TopTieramisu> pat would be rider. on his gamer cube
[0:10:11] <Hellvis92> Depends on which of the 5 Shikis you mean @brunoberserk
[0:10:13] <maskedmook> shiki(any of the 3) could beat every servant
[0:10:20] <am_omega> I would not call this going down the hole, this is more looking at a fun fighting game.
[0:10:22] <subjectg> Pat Rider in his Gamer Cube, obv
[0:10:23] <+cherryceecee> @brunoberserk she can kill anything thats techincally living so yeah
[0:10:23] <%Wool> could Goku beat every servant
[0:10:24] <phatmac16> Pat would be Caster since he’s a streamer
[0:10:25] <+OroOreo> jojo
[0:10:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> god the sax in this is amazing
[0:10:31] <brunoberserk> @Hellvis92 ... yes
[0:10:32] <powerprotoman> im happy to be shit posting in the chat but seriously tho, i hope woolie isnt scared off by fate fans
[0:10:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYEYEYEYE FATE TIME BITCHES
[0:10:34] <TheSaltminer> Pat would be a Caster, Crazy Talk is his NP
[0:10:36] <+kinmarik> I hope woolie likes bazett she's my favorite punch lord
[0:10:39] <phatmac16> Can Gil kill Goku?
[0:10:49] <+TopTieramisu> in short... no
[0:10:52] <+D00msDayDan> @powerprotoman remember when they played this on the channel and the sub was flooded with fate fans for like a week?
[0:10:56] <alephalpha> woolie l8ke szero lancer he's palyed this a couple tiems at liek amgfest
[0:10:57] <phatmac16> He likes Bazett
[0:10:58] <chaos2frozen> you say that now, but next thing you know Woolie is posting tweet about his New Year Banner pulls
[0:10:58] <+TopTieramisu> dbz power levels are absurd
[0:11:04] <maskedmook> Bazett is best punch girl
[0:11:04] <Hellvis92> yes but no
[0:11:06] <+alphonseisbest> @D00msDayDan GOOD TIMES
[0:11:16] <%CaptainPileDriver> god this sax
[0:11:17] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> plot twist: Woolie knew that the third lostbelt released today in NA so to celebrate he made this the stream game. All along Woolie knew
[0:11:18] <am_omega> I would laugh if he does but I don't think he would.
[0:11:23] <Tr1pkT12> Gil is only powerful against servants. Goku would beat him.
[0:11:25] <am_omega> Too much grinding.
[0:11:25] <phatmac16> Hope he sees all the special videos that I linked him. Baz’s specials are sick
[0:11:28] <%Pigg1yJuffs> Alright. All the Fate fans in here, we have to condemn the horrid shit about Fate as hard as we can. No one mention the magical girl shit. No magic is stored in the balls. We have to keep it classy, damn it.
[0:11:34] <powerprotoman> @powerprotoman yeah wasnt a bad time
[0:11:36] <%Gogogolem> Gogogolem subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months, currently on a 24 month streak! Hey woolie its that time again. What part of your body dies last. Answer: Your eyes, they dilate. Badum Tssh.
[0:11:38] <FastmanJones> We're probably getting a Fate conversation on the next podcast. Is this good news, you decide.
[0:11:40] <+kinmarik> sweet
[0:11:42] <YaminoRaiden> I heard Fate was in here.
[0:11:48] <CyberEne> @kosorsomesaykosm_ whats a lostbelt
[0:11:50] <phatmac16> Woolie would hate Fate if he looked up Musashi
[0:11:50] <%PkSilent01> Here it comes
[0:11:51] <subjectg> do we at least get to talk about the worms
[0:11:52] <redrins> indeed it is in here
[0:11:52] <+LandOfTheWay> @pigg1yjuffs fate was never classy and you know it
[0:11:53] <chaos2frozen> @Pigg1yJuffs And we especially don't talk about Merlin
[0:11:53] <%Th3SmartAlec> @pigg1yjuffs what was that about worms?
[0:11:59] <Aussie_Manny> WTF, is Woolz jumping into some Fate?
[0:12:04] <rosencruez> this is gonna be fun
[0:12:07] <am_omega> The only thing podcast wise would probably be how fun this game is.
[0:12:08] <%jiggy_snipe> idk anything about Fate. Magic is stored in the balls? lol
[0:12:11] <brunoberserk> god i forgot how many versions of disilusion exists , there TOO MANY
[0:12:14] <GothicLolitaAngel> He’s gonna talk about the origins right? We know what that means right
[0:12:15] <+TopTieramisu> i don't want to look up fate musashi but fate sasaki kojiro is great
[0:12:16] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @CyberEne it's from FGO's story
[0:12:16] <%GalacticaPhanto> @pigg1yjuffs I mean with Prism thr positive stuff is good, the bad...is bsd
[0:12:20] <Hellvis92> "Her defenseless ass"
[0:12:20] <Thunderhog> im just here hoping to see Unlimited blade works tonight
[0:12:21] <nikolatesla_iii> No matter what, i feel Woolies opinion on fate will not change, and if anything he will hate it more by the end of the night
[0:12:21] <+alphonseisbest> @chaos2frozen FUCK DAT DICK WIZARD ALL DAY EVERY DAY
[0:12:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @phatmac16 eh theres a ton of other characters I'm sure he'll be ok with
[0:12:24] <+D00msDayDan> you thought this was get into fighting games, it's actually GET INTO FATE
[0:12:26] <+kaiber132> does Woolie have a discord?
[0:12:31] <%Pigg1yJuffs> @landoftheway I know, but a man can pick and choose the cool shit out of the things I like.
[0:12:32] <maskedmook> Magic can do anything and that's all the lore you need about Fate
[0:12:33] <CyberEne> archus looks so cool
[0:12:36] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I AM THE BONE OF MY SWORD

[0:12:58] <$cherubs_anonymous> For Fun or For Glory?
[0:12:59] <laserbeaming> Why would codes be anything but unlimited? It's an abstract concept, it's not like it's tied to a physical resource.
[0:13:03] <+TopTieramisu> SourPls
[0:13:04] <%PkSilent01> woolieYE
[0:13:05] <am_omega> Fate lore: Mages are the biggest bullshit and are inhuman monsters.
[0:13:07] <phatmac16> He likes Bazett when he played it the first time
[0:13:07] <CyberEne> the funny meme party

[0:13:59] <+KgKid51> Rin loops PogChamp
[0:14:00] <subjectg> Woke: Bill and Ted is a Fate spinoff
[0:14:00] <TheSaltminer> Mages in Fate see themselves as X-Men mutants, a different species from humans that's better in every way
[0:14:03] <+TopTieramisu> rin is a true 1%er. burning through gems for every spell
[0:14:07] <maskedmook> @chaos2frozen you mean the FGO arcade game?
[0:14:10] <am_omega> FUC 2 with like the servants in this game and a few more would be aces.

[0:16:58] <tiaramaki> Why DOES Berserker go berserk?
[0:16:58] <+GrassCannon> Juse because you're correct doesn't mean you're right, Woolie
[0:16:59] <+LandOfTheWay> fate fans can't read, so lord please forgive their bullshit
[0:17:07] <Aussie_Manny> Was it a Fisticuffs or a Scrublords...?
[0:17:09] <brunoberserk> '' so as i pray ''
[0:17:17] <CyberEne> woolie you just made me sad because no mag this year
[0:17:18] <KnivesEve> wait FUC is a capcom fighting game?
[0:17:21] <phatmac16> Fate fans read a novel larger than lord of the rings
[0:17:22] <+cherryceecee> @LandOfTheWay thats false, i read the VNs
[0:17:24] <am_omega> That is a lie, Fate fans read too much.
[0:17:24] <+ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Is Woolie a capcom fighting game now?
[0:17:26] <GothicLolitaAngel> Yup @kniveseve
[0:17:29] <%GalacticaPhanto> I actually remember when I saw you play this at Mag! I was too drunk and didnt want to embarrass both of us so I hyped you from afar lol
[0:17:30] <CyberEne> this is a cavia game
[0:17:31] <maskedmook> that sign cant stop me because I cant read
[0:17:37] <%Livelinne> Heyyy Saudi prince baught SNK woolieSHOOK
[0:17:37] <SableS139a> @KnivesEve Yep. F/UC is a collab between Capcom & Type:Moon.
[0:17:40] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Smart of Woolie to keep the hoodie on, to minimize the brain damage, the foreign gods will not reach him today
[0:17:42] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BRAVE SHINE BEST OP
[0:17:43] <+alphonseisbest> @LandOfTheWay But the only thing FGO FANS can do IS READ LUL
[0:17:51] <garbageheaphound> its a shame a fate stay night game like melty blood would be rad
[0:18:01] <phatmac16> All FGO fans do is skip the story
[0:18:02] <KnivesEve> huh thats an interesting tid bit
[0:18:02] <+cascadepersona> Type Moon was pretty cool in the PS2 days.
[0:18:04] <Aussie_Manny> @tiaramaki That's a side effect of being summoned as a Berserker class servant. Their madness trait gets multiplied along with their strength, so they end up very strong, but also insane.
[0:18:05] <+LandOfTheWay> @alphonseisbest FGO fans are double illiterate
[0:18:06] <brunoberserk> i ill love if french bread did a fate fighting game

[0:21:29] <dr_sweets> There is a character in Fate called Primate Murder and that's all the lore you need

[0:21:44] <%GalacticaPhanto> It's crazy because the majority of Fate is terrible but the designs are good except the ones where they're meant to be PoC and instead of white but whoops
[0:21:45] <@Menitta> I just like that one guy with the stupid intro from Saltybet

[0:24:20] <maskedmook> @kinmarik yes
[0:24:21] <GothicLolitaAngel> Yes @kinmarik
[0:24:24] <SableS139a> @rosabellamelantha Yeah, pretty much. Has the Jacky situation gotten any better in the west recently?
[0:24:28] <SeruraRenge> @kinmarik He's 2 servants
[0:24:29] <mr_ghoul_99> charlemagne is two servants
[0:24:29] <@Solidus_113> RIP Granblue
[0:24:30] <+alphonseisbest> @rosabellamelantha Yea... but her outfit is trash tho 4whats she is
[0:24:31] <+kinmarik> is he cool in fate?

[0:24:31] <majindusto> You cannot Stop the PADORU tho
[0:24:33] <lucky_icarus> Yes, both as Karl Magnus and as the storied Paladin
[0:24:39] <mr_ghoul_99> one is a fuck boi twink
[0:24:40] <ManlyMcBeefington> @rosabellamelantha I prefer her 3rd asension art, the cape is cool
[0:24:40] <+LandOfTheWay> i legit feel bad for woolie's only exposure to fate being the fans. he'd probably actually enjoy at least some of it
[0:24:45] <mr_ghoul_99> the other is a huge chad kin from his later yeats
[0:24:50] <%Akizea> @LandOfTheWay oh he totally would
[0:24:59] <%optimasmaximas> OH GOD
[0:24:59] <@Menitta> Why are you FORCING that one guy to watch your content
[0:25:03] <phatmac16> Yeah he’s probably like Fate/Zero not sure about UBW
[0:25:03] <%optimasmaximas> that twitter guy
[0:25:06] <@Solidus_113> Stop forcing people into fighting games Woolie it's a dead genre Kappa
[0:25:09] <lucky_icarus> Why do Fate fans always think people will enjoy it?
[0:25:15] <majindusto> TIME FOR WIFI HATE
[0:25:19] <+PenGia> I can't believe woolie held that guy at gunpoint and made him listen to rollback discussion
[0:25:19] <%0rond> fate has a lot of shit woolie will probably find rad
[0:25:22] <lem______> are we really bringing this up this guy now?
[0:25:28] <SnakeVash> Jack the ripper is all of London's underage prostitutes and miscarried babies forced into one existence that just want to live
[0:25:28] <rosabellamelantha> @SableS139a What do you mean? Jack is still Jack, she's still the same as ever but she did get a cute new costume in FGO arcade
[0:25:31] <@Solidus_113> you can't make me stop watching
[0:25:32] <+alphonseisbest> @lucky_icarus cuz we do? thats a dumb question man
[0:25:37] <%BallerSwagBro9k> My Top 5 Fate Waifus are: Serenity, Jalter, Nero, Altera, and Okita Alter
[0:25:39] <phatmac16> Fate Zero is a good anime
[0:25:41] <%Pigg1yJuffs> Can we just get a mod to link Woolie to a bunch of wikis for the Nasuverse, just so that he can filter out the fans and cringe and get the actual meat of what Fate is?
[0:25:44] <SeruraRenge> Easiest way to describe the original Fate VN was Anime Highlander, not counting that there was an actual Highlander anime
[0:25:48] <+pyrojack6> I'm almost enjoying my anger
[0:25:51] <bbHighvalor> when's Sakamoto Ryoma PogChamp

[0:26:05] <@Menitta> no but I ENJOY being ANGRY
[0:26:06] <phatmac16> Can we stop linking Woolie to Fate stuff since he doesn’t want to get into it
[0:26:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> but i like hearing about that stuff though
[0:26:11] <%LCLSmoothie> @BallerSwagBro9k nice
[0:26:14] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @lucky_icarus usually because at this point there's so much of it that you're likely to like at least one design if nothing else...that said there's no point in forcing people

[0:26:34] <SableS139a> @rosabellamelantha I thought that Jacky was still getting some shit here by folks here in the west for looking the way she does. If I'm wrong, then do correct me. Also new FGOA costume for best daughter you say?

[0:27:31] <0cash> or a wickerman if you will... wink wink
[0:27:34] <rosabellamelantha> so I wish people would stopp pushing him to shit on assassin jack
[0:27:35] <%optimasmaximas> “WIFI HATE IS AS BAD AS RACISM”
[0:27:40] <SeruraRenge> The problem with Fate is that everything except the VN itself misrepresents the VN and there has yet to be an adaptation that doesn't fuck it up in some way
[0:27:41] <SableS139a> @rosabellamelantha I'm looking at her new costume right now and Jacky looks dapper as fuck. I love it!
[0:27:42] <phatmac16> Strange Fake Jack is cool

[0:27:58] <+Meidolaon> Oh hey Woolie's actually LPing Fate, should I shoot him the $200 I originally was gonna send Pat if he LP'd a Fate game?
[0:27:58] <MahoganyWoods> "WIre? Nah bro its 2020."
[0:28:02] <lotharrio> We still talking wifighters?
[0:28:10] <%Pigg1yJuffs> @meidolaon Do it.
[0:28:13] <tiaramaki> @Meidolaon Go for it
[0:28:13] <%optimasmaximas> @zayasu get a cable
[0:28:24] <am_omega> The biggest problem with adapting the VN is you can't have a whole episode about Shirou's internal dialogue segments.
[0:28:29] <bigmantalope> My powerline adapter doesn't work well because the house wiring is substandard. it's rad
[0:28:29] <%optimasmaximas> @meidolaon this isnt an lp
[0:28:30] <+alphonseisbest> @Meidolaon hell yea dude
[0:28:31] <SnakeVash> It's not really Fate @meidolaon
[0:28:33] <phatmac16> He’s not LP’ing the fighting game since he’s not doing the story mode
[0:28:43] <majindusto> Oh Boy, HERE WE GO
[0:28:46] <ManlyMcBeefington> @rosabellamelantha More versions of Jack only enhances the cute Jack via contrast and comparison, I find it okay with both examples
[0:28:48] <+kinmarik> no one chooses to be on WiFi in a fighter but simply have no other option
[0:28:56] <%0rond> "what about wi fi on wi fi games" /s
[0:28:58] <SeruraRenge> @am_omega You could, but no studio would be enough of a madman to do it. It would have to be like 100 OVAs like LoGH is

[0:30:48] <brunoberserk> wow
[0:30:53] <ManlyMcBeefington> @rosabellamelantha honestly just blame the authors and how much effort they put into each jacks character development.
[0:30:57] <am_omega> I would kill for a new Fate fighting game as long as it is made by a competent team.
[0:30:57] <+deviljhojho_> UNLIMITED CODE WORKS
[0:31:03] <+alphonseisbest> TRUTH
[0:31:03] <subjectg> I remember Aris watching tutorials for Dirt Rally, those would be a step in the right direction for fightin game teachingg
[0:31:03] <+Lionhart16> also, the Ufotable adaptation of Unlimited Blade Works along with the Heaven's Feel movies have pretty amazing fight scenes and animation in general.
[0:31:05] <+Spider1991> just fluff
[0:31:07] <%optimasmaximas> this dono started out well
[0:31:09] <@Solidus_113> Yeah but souls games are extremely popular, despite the complete lack of tutorial, and "learn by doing" gameplay style
[0:31:13] <lucky_icarus> @rosabellamelantha While they may be different characters, ones not a child in a fucking thong. I wonder why most prefer SF Jack
[0:31:14] <+Dova573> I think max said it best, make sure game is fun then go from there
[0:31:17] <0cash> I would love a new fate fighting game, ala granblue
[0:31:22] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh hey this is an interesting discussion
[0:31:27] <SnakeVash> I was in the middle of watching his 13 Sentinels LP, when I got that tweet. Fun Facts
[0:31:31] <phatmac16> They’re not gonna play FUC at this point
[0:31:31] <ATentacleMonster> oh
[0:31:35] <+Meidolaon> NGL a new Fate fighting game from like French Bread would be dope
[0:31:36] <kaminarihime3> A new fighting game w fgo characters would be sick
[0:31:37] <%JustYudha> Just got on what did I miss
[0:31:40] <SeruraRenge> there is a new Fate fighting game. It's fucking terrible and no one plays it
[0:31:42] <+kinmarik> people who don't like fighters just assume they all the same like those who hate all anime
[0:31:46] <kenny_biff> Happy turkey day from america woolie
[0:31:48] <chaos2frozen> @Solidus_113 Souls games are 'simple' to play by comparison.
[0:31:49] <%CaptainPileDriver> currently for the foreseeable future, i have to live with my folks again
[0:31:53] <0cash> @SeruraRenge which one?
[0:31:57] <SeruraRenge> @WoolieVersus
[0:31:59] <%Irridium> rollback won't fix it completely but it'll help with the majority of problems
[0:31:59] <SeruraRenge> shit
[0:32:00] <rosabellamelantha> @lucky_icarus and again people are only focusing on her outfit, something YOU CAN CHANGE instead of her personality, I just wanna give my daughter headpats man
[0:32:00] <%JustYudha> I just heard some scrub quotes
[0:32:05] <SeruraRenge> @0cash FGO Arcade
[0:32:05] <am_omega> FGO Arcade is not a fighting game. I refuse.
[0:32:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> so i have limited router stuff
[0:32:09] <%optimasmaximas> @phatmac16 they always take a half hour to an hour preshow get over it
[0:32:15] <majindusto> GET FUCKED LOL
[0:32:17] <@Menitta> I know I dont
[0:32:17] <+NekoDraga> Made it in time for Unlimited Codes. Running through tne new FGO chapter as I watch
[0:32:17] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> fgo arcade is more like a musou
[0:32:20] <+alphonseisbest> @Solidus_113 yea but DS don't control like A fight game tho
[0:32:23] <%Goku01899> MoCA adapters
[0:32:25] <pizzaemon> wifi untermensch
[0:32:25] <huskarl_zap> FATE PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[0:32:26] <am_omega> Its like that Marvel Contest of Champions kinda deal.
[0:32:30] <YakumoYomi> There was a time when I didn't have the ability to "wire up". Quite frankly, I just didn't play online.
[0:32:37] <SableS139a> @rosabellamelantha Give her all the headpats, Rosa. Jacky deserves them and then some.
[0:32:38] <%0rond> FGO arcade is almost exactly dissidia final fantasy
[0:32:39] <%TubeMan642> I live with my family and I am the one who pay the internet bill and owns the modem/router
[0:32:40] <huskarl_zap> POST ASTOLFO
[0:32:41] <subjectg> @nycrownlessking i don’t think that many people have the capacity or ability for duplicity
[0:32:44] <+NYCrownlessKing> ppl put all kinds of effort to get a job, you can totally put an effort to convince why you should go wired
[0:32:49] <0cash> @SeruraRenge I mean, thats kind of a fighting game. And not very acessible since its japan only. But yeah i wish there was something else
[0:32:50] <Darren716> I bought the racquet (game) already though, i should be able to play
[0:32:55] <%JustYudha> Fuck em
[0:32:55] <brunoberserk> woolieKICKDAD woolieKICKDAD woolieKICKDAD
[0:32:57] <rosabellamelantha> @ManlyMcBeefington Apoc Jack honestly probably has more development overall so far than SF Jack the problem is just 90% of that shit is in the STILL NOT FULLY TRANSLATED LIGHT NOVEL
[0:33:01] <+NYCrownlessKing> this isnt the duality of man that has become of the hardest things to achieved.
[0:33:04] <+Meidolaon> Hell, Fate's got enough punchfolks for it, with Martha, Penth, Beowulf, the Buddhists, Li Shuwen, Yan Qing...
[0:33:05] <+Lionhart16> @kosorsomesaykosm_ I'd say its more like Dissisa FF NT.
[0:33:06] <%hologram_sam> It's not about access, it's about authority. SOme people don't get to say how the internet is distributed in their space
[0:33:15] <Darren716> That should be the only barrier to entry, if I want to play on wifi then that's too bad, devs should step up
[0:33:16] <phatmac16> a console FGO arcade would be neat
[0:33:21] <rosabellamelantha> if you can't read japanese or get someone who can to read it for you like I did it fucking sucks
[0:33:24] <@Solidus_113> @Solidus_113 they might be, but the comparison still works. Much like Monster Hunter as well, fighting games are entirely animation focused games. you do an action and have to wait for it to finish before you can start another one, unless you get a hit
[0:33:26] <pizzaemon> playing on wifi is like showing up to the court without shoes
[0:33:27] <am_omega> Old man Li Shuwen would be fun as hell in a fighting game.
[0:33:28] <%CaptainPileDriver> i mean, i plan to move my parents router back into the room closest to my tv/console
[0:33:30] <+NYCrownlessKing> being wired does not contol the distribution, wifi is still accessible. so its not an argument @hologram_sam
[0:33:31] <SjoeB89> Is he playing all the games?
[0:33:36] <%LCLSmoothie> thats a lie. i brought a arcade stick and im still bad!
[0:33:36] <0cash> console fgo arcade would scratch a itch for sure
[0:33:36] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Lionhart16 yeah, that's a better comparison actually
[0:33:43] <rosabellamelantha> luckily the apoc manga is being a better adaptation of the LN than the anime is
[0:33:46] <+Meidolaon> He's just playing Unlimited Codes
[0:33:49] <%JustYudha> it's like playing a competitive fps on pc but then you try to use a controller and complain that everyone is doing better than you...
[0:33:54] <Pookiedaexzile> Why woolie Dressed like he finna ask me what my three wishes are
[0:33:54] <MKII> if you're stuck on wifi join the fight for working rollback netcode. wifi is more bearable when your opponent isn't accidentally lag switching you out of combos
[0:33:57] <%0rond> i'm afraid fgo arcade is too reliant on the machine specific aspect to be ported
[0:33:58] <Darren716> No other game has this problem, only fighting games. Sounds like fighting games should fix themselves for wifi maybe
[0:33:59] <+Arnoldoaad1> Play with a Piano Keyboard
[0:34:00] <+kinmarik> the fightstick stuff died fast in tekken
[0:34:00] <Ghostbody> Rollback will help the people that in that situation. And you'll still get games just the people that have less people to play.
[0:34:08] <+Lionhart16> @phatmac16 people are kinda hoping for that, especially since there are servants like Proto Merlin that are in Arcade and not in the mobile game.
[0:34:09] <%0rond> your consoles can't print out gacha cards
[0:34:17] <+Meidolaon> God the Strange Fake manga is just magnifique tho
[0:34:17] <+CaptainJax> get a powerline network adapter shit's magic
[0:34:20] <+Tainted_Ninja> Quetz would be so sick in a fighting game
[0:34:21] <SnakeVash> I've played with Li Shuwen in Extella. it's not fun. Very limited mobility.
[0:34:22] <Pookiedaexzile> Powerline cost 15 dollars
[0:34:26] <+alphonseisbest> @Solidus_113 its not about animation its about input, if dodging in DS worked like doing a recka in a fight game did, LOTS of folk would drop it day 1
[0:34:29] <+Meidolaon> Quetz for Smash
[0:34:34] <Darren716> Powerline ain't shit if your house isn't wired a specific way
[0:34:35] <am_omega> Well yeah Extella is trash.
[0:34:35] <phatmac16> Porto Merlin will get info FGO eventually
[0:34:43] <%0rond> rider da vinci came to arcade first and than fgo proper, it's highly possible we'll get proto merlin and sita eventually
[0:34:45] <%optimasmaximas> its not the people who are literally unable to do anything about their situation
[0:34:47] <+Kurt_0> I think switch is in a very weird situation with the switch lite
[0:34:49] <+Meidolaon> Link's okay as a Musou
[0:34:51] <%optimasmaximas> its the people whi refuse to
[0:34:54] <+Spider1991> Wait, who play any online game with wifi
[0:34:57] <+Lionhart16> @meidolaon I've heard good things about it, but I don't know if there has been any updates on it as of late.
[0:34:57] <brunoberserk> the only fighting i play with arcade stick is KOF and SF , the other ones i prefer a normal stick ( specially MK and tekken )
[0:34:58] <+Spider1991> ?
[0:34:59] <phatmac16> Link is better
[0:34:59] <ManlyMcBeefington> @rosabellamelantha perhaps the fact that SF Jack has more back in forth with their master makes it so they have more potential to be more dynamic then Apovh Jack that served as a antagonist for the middle of the atory
[0:35:01] <+alphonseisbest> yea fuck those folk
[0:35:04] <shadowmaksim> Well, hopefully this goes well enough. Impression of the series aside, "F/UC" is a pretty fun fighting game.
[0:35:09] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @phatmac16 I sure hope so, her design is actually kinda nice
[0:35:31] <+Meidolaon> @Lionhart16 It's in a weird spot where I think it's a bimonthly release
[0:35:33] <0cash> the thing is, someone who is new to the FGC wont even get how 'wrong' it is to play on wifi, and if he gets 'ostracized', he wont ever properly join the fgc anyway
[0:35:35] <MahoganyWoods> Anyone know if GGPO cam make games playable for wifi players?
[0:35:37] <kaminarihime3> If Jack gets people this riled up, check out Emiya alter lol
[0:35:38] <%JustYudha> Just because you're suffering doesn't mean you have the right to drag other people with you...
[0:35:38] <+kinmarik> F:UC or FUC?
[0:35:46] <am_omega> F/UC
[0:35:47] <Darren716> If my wifi connection is fine in literally every other game, then it sounds like it is the fighting game devs faults for not making better netcode
[0:35:48] <SableS139a> @kinmarik Y e s
[0:35:52] <phatmac16> FUC
[0:35:56] <am_omega> Or you can just say FUC
[0:36:00] <CyrusVGZ> Woolie bringing the nuance I've been trying to put into the Wifi vs Wired discourse.
[0:36:02] <pizzaemon> F/UC
[0:36:05] <KogaNoidZX> F/UC
[0:36:08] <+Spider1991> @Darren716 *cough* cap
[0:36:11] <SnakeVash> Emiya Alter died for Abigail Williams
[0:36:11] <%0rond> btw this game contains spoilers for fate VN and possibly hollow attraxia, watch at your own risk
[0:36:16] <+Lionhart16> Anyone here been reading Fate Red line, the serious Koha Ace adaptation?
[0:36:29] <pizzaemon> OMG DA LORE!!1
[0:36:38] <rosabellamelantha> @kaminarihime3 I think people are being relatively normal about Jack tbh, nobody is just straight trashing on her or anything
[0:36:38] <phatmac16> Yeah spoilers for Fate if you want to see it
[0:36:41] <am_omega> and it can be for multiple reasons, like doing a sick combo that feels good? "FUC that was good"
[0:36:42] <+alphonseisbest> @Lionhart16 a little bit i love how Nobu is drawn in it!
[0:36:45] <SeruraRenge> I find the cringing at Jack the Ripper hilarious considering this is the same franchise where the perfect end to Kagetsu Tohya that actually stops the groundhog day loop is Shiki fucking Len who is an explicit loli.
[0:36:45] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:36:45] <SeruraRenge> Don't talk shit about Detroit Emiya
[0:36:51] <Ammondale> oh boy is it time to explain Fate lore?
[0:36:59] <+alphonseisbest> NO
[0:37:01] <shadowmaksim> Oh yeah, I keep forgetting about that. There's some notable spoilers here.
[0:37:01] <+kinmarik> it should be mostly in I subbed japanese so spoilers are just character states like sakura's
[0:37:04] <phatmac16> Nope
[0:37:11] <gordieda20> Ah yes GUN EMIYA
[0:37:22] <+kinmarik> *unsubbed japanese
[0:37:25] <am_omega> No lets not bombard with Fate lore unless asked.
[0:37:25] <SnakeVash> Dark Sakura here, yep.
[0:37:26] <Pookiedaexzile> Yeah bu ME tho
[0:37:29] <phatmac16> Someone donated the Merlin penis thing which ruined lore talk
[0:37:29] <Darren716> But I can drive on other F1 tracks with no issues
[0:37:32] <Pookiedaexzile> Buh Me tho
[0:37:43] <am_omega> But combo info an shit? yeyeye
[0:37:50] <Darren716> It's just the F1 track labeled "fighting games" that's the issue so sounds like they should fix the track
[0:37:51] <rosabellamelantha> @SeruraRenge I don't cringe at Jack lol, I just find her outfit ill fitting for her personality, it'd make sense if she was like chloe or some shit but Jack is P consistently depicted as innocent and curious child
[0:38:00] <+Lionhart16> @alphonseisbest agreed. helps that she's cutting loose more compared to other content featuring her.
[0:38:01] <+Rookie_Balboa> I am going to simply ignore that this stream is happening, for my own mental health as a Fate fan
[0:38:07] <+alphonseisbest> @phatmac16 actually they dropped it to get it out of the way
[0:38:11] <Zayasu> just let me dodge wifi players in every fighting game :)
[0:38:21] <ManlyMcBeefington> @rosabellamelantha personally I like the gimmick of SF Jack abilities since they are a low rank summon instead of Apoc's Jacks abilities which are pretty powerful in comparison, maybe it is the preference of scale in the combat the story's display.
[0:38:26] <phatmac16> Also Fate/Redline is great hope it gets its own anime one day
[0:38:26] <+Meidolaon> Jack is weird in that she's treated as both childlike and hella knowledgable about the dark side of things
[0:38:29] <devanmuse> @phatmac16 I think someone else also donated in a Pat stream a while back to talk about the Crestworms in Fate... the dickworms
[0:38:29] <0cash> If the game simply gave a message saying: "A LAN cable is recommended for online play" would be a great start
[0:38:30] <shadowmaksim> The best way I can describe "Fate" lore is like if you're trying to explain Marvel/DC to someone. It's not that bad, just a lot of it made by different people throughout many years.
[0:38:31] <RayCSmooth> Driving a golf cart on the autobahn
[0:38:31] <bbHighvalor> @zayasu especially Brazilian kens
[0:38:36] <SnakeVash> Emiya Alter's original Color Scheme was cool. What they did to him is beyond racist and insulting to the character.
[0:38:38] <SeruraRenge> @rosabellamelantha She's the amalgamation of dead prostitute fetuses, it's not odd that she dresses like one
[0:38:47] <+alphonseisbest> @Lionhart16 yea, plus Oki is waay move then alll jokes and lovey dovey made me wanna whale for her in fgo
[0:38:48] <KogaNoidZX> My ISP is terrible cause I live in the middle of nowhere and even if I go wired it still spikes, although not as bad on wifi
[0:38:49] <+NYCrownlessKing> yeah, anyone who complains about wifi indicators are like ppl with cars complaining that ppl with F1's now know ur car aint good enough so u cant join the big boys.
[0:38:52] <MahoganyWoods> What if they didnt let wifi players see other wifi players?
[0:38:55] <+NYCrownlessKing> but ur allowed to play with whoever else u want at ur level
[0:39:01] <+Meidolaon> 80000 dead hooker babies, that's Jack the Ripper
[0:39:03] <ManlyMcBeefington> @serurarenge damn that is cold but actually makes sense
[0:39:09] <lovlyvibes> Asking to lower the bar is a nono
[0:39:12] <phatmac16> Emiya Alter was designed to be racist don’t know how that got approved
[0:39:21] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> to put it simply, playing fighting games is complicated
[0:39:23] <SnakeVash> Literally YES @meidolaon
[0:39:24] <Pookiedaexzile> Wifi Realism
[0:39:27] <+alphonseisbest> @SnakeVash are u white cuz thats a very white take son
[0:39:35] <KogaNoidZX> @MahoganyWoods If it was just Wi-Fi connections that wouldn't be shown but they showed wired, people would probably know they're on wi-fi and dodge them anyway
[0:39:47] <+Lionhart16> @alphonseisbest I'm glad I already have her. the one character I WISH would come home is Musashi.
[0:39:51] <+Meidolaon> @phatmac16 'Cause Nasu didn't catch it, it's why he's the only servant censored in NA
[0:39:51] <rosabellamelantha> @SeruraRenge eh no even, 90% of her outfit is like a normal design but then randomly where you would expect shorts there is instead a thong and it just doesn't fit?
[0:39:59] <devanmuse> My Fate knowledge is slapdash, built from wiki dives, hearsay, parodies, and Carnival Phantasm, but I really do want to read the original vn someday... if only it would ever get released in the states
[0:40:14] <haisho> I will never forgive FGO Arcade for being the only Fate game that gives Jack pants
[0:40:14] <rosabellamelantha> if the rest of her outfit was skimpy too that'd maybe add up but it isn't
[0:40:22] <KogaNoidZX> Also I max grailed Raikou in FGO and tapped out, I did not enjoy grinding that game at all
[0:40:27] <kaminarihime3> Tamamo straight up calls him "Detroit emiya"
[0:40:34] <lem______> Imagine if other genres had the same quality of netcode as most current era fighting games. They would be laughed off of the fucking stage
[0:40:36] <+StrifeZubia> @devanmuse Carnival Phantasm is all the canon you really need
[0:40:39] <+NigglyDiggly> oh god not fate!
[0:40:42] <phatmac16> @meidolaon Takeuchi is the one who approves the art, the concept was an Emiya that went to prison which is racist as fuck with having a black steroytype in mind
[0:40:42] <%0rond> we've gotten fgo arcade outfits in fgo proper before
[0:40:42] <$saintshin> they gave emiya alter a whole fade man what were they thinking
[0:40:46] <+Meidolaon> @kaminarihime3 Except in NA where he's called "Edgemiya"
[0:40:46] <MahoganyWoods> @KogaNoidZX Im talking about only showing a wifi indicator for anything and only showing it to people on wired connections. Dont give wifi players the opportunity to see and dodge anyone for anything.
[0:40:47] <Pookiedaexzile> But I bought my game
[0:40:48] <SnakeVash> Smart Cat calls him Demiya. Not Tamamo OG
[0:40:50] <lucky_icarus> The grind in FGO is easily the worst part of the game for me. which is a shame cause its 90% of it.
[0:40:52] <Pookiedaexzile> and I bought my console
[0:40:58] <%Wool> Any general activity or hobby is going to have some kind of barrier of entry
[0:41:04] <Pookiedaexzile> I deserve to Make everyone else suffer
[0:41:06] <+alphonseisbest> @Lionhart16 nice tho Musashi Does get alot of rates up so u've sooo many chances, but dear ol Oki only has like one left LUL
[0:41:06] <rosabellamelantha> The grind in FGO is a zen like thing for me
[0:41:09] <sosuke5> Get out of fighting games
[0:41:13] <+Lionhart16> @devanmuse there's unofficial translations of it along with the remake they did a decade ago I believe.
[0:41:21] <devanmuse> @StrifeZubia Berserker won the Grail War during a day trip to buy batteries for a neet loli. Best ending
[0:41:23] <KogaNoidZX> @MahoganyWoods Oh, then wired people would still dodge, because most don't want to play Wi-Fi players anyway, that's how the indicator discussion started in the first place
[0:41:28] <rosabellamelantha> I like the grind because I grew up on old MMOs and gacha is like the only place I can get that oldschool grind nowdays
[0:41:28] <phatmac16> @devanmuse You can download it pretty easy, it’s not coming with an official translation
[0:41:29] <Pookiedaexzile> Just say RedBars go home
[0:41:33] <RayCSmooth> If you can afford to buy the console and the game... you can afford the cable
[0:41:34] <+Meidolaon> @phatmac16 Probably why Takeuchi didn't catch it either. Mind, Takeuchi is too busy thinking with his dick to consider racism in designs
[0:41:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> bro, you need proper lads, not taped on pillows
[0:41:37] <Nekros4442> red bars go home
[0:41:39] <+StrifeZubia> @devanmuse I SUMMON YOU! BERSERKAR!
[0:41:41] <Pookiedaexzile> RBGH
[0:41:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> *pads
[0:41:54] <SnakeVash> BerserkCAR
[0:42:03] <SeruraRenge> after a certain point you reach an apex in the grind and you don't really need to grind anymore outside of certain events. And in those cases I just use a macro to play the game for me
[0:42:04] <bbHighvalor> If a wifi player doesn't even wanna fight a wifi, than they shouldnt be allowed to play
[0:42:05] <maskedmook> I never play fighting games but it's fun to learn about this stuff
[0:42:09] <phatmac16> BERSERCAR
[0:42:12] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> "fuck wifi players" - wifi players
[0:42:14] <MahoganyWoods> @KogaNoidZX Yeah but im just wondering how different the discussion would be if wifi players werent dodging eachother in addition to being dodged by ethernet players.
[0:42:14] <brunoberserk> wifi on wifi crimes
[0:42:14] <+Lionhart16> BASAKAR
[0:42:17] <ManlyMcBeefington> Sitonai Bearzerker is great, wish I rolled for her.
[0:42:19] <$saintshin> im wondering why emiya turned black in the first place
[0:42:19] <Pookiedaexzile> RBGH
[0:42:26] <+Kurt_0> People on waifu not wanting WiFi players are actually hypocrites
[0:42:28] <sosuke5> "fuck them kids" - them kids
[0:42:28] <shadowmaksim> Oh geez, does this mean we might see Woolie try out some of the EX Mission minigames? That might be hilarious.
[0:42:29] <devanmuse> @phatmac16 I get that they exist, but I'm nervous about going through channels and sites like that... even if it's totally irrational :/
[0:42:31] <lucky_icarus> @meidolaon Poor Ushi. Could've had a nice kimono design than...what she had.
[0:42:31] <Ghostbody> I'm still take on those Wi-Fi players... all to the hits of my sanity points
[0:42:32] <Pookiedaexzile> WPGH RBGH
[0:42:39] <haisho> all people need to know about Fate is that jokes are the deepest lore and Riyo is a fucking prophet
[0:42:41] <brunoberserk> depends on the game
[0:42:41] <SnakeVash> Sitonai is an Alterego
[0:42:48] <@Solidus_113> Them's Fighting Herds DOES!
[0:42:52] <Aussie_Manny> @WoolieVersus There's no tutorial for neutral.
[0:42:53] <+psychocalibur> vf4 tho?
[0:42:53] <Pookiedaexzile> Nah brain dead go brr
[0:42:53] <jorniev> this is probably the only time for fate fans to talk about stuff... better make the most of it guys.
[0:42:57] <Pookiedaexzile> life bar go down
[0:42:57] <SeruraRenge> @saintshin He killed a ton of Kiara's followers trying to reach her and it burned him down to his soul
[0:42:57] <rosabellamelantha> Honestly I'm just waiting for my inn owner bird wife at this point
[0:43:01] <%Wool> Tutorials have been very improved at least compared to older ones
[0:43:04] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @saintshin skin got burned from using magic too much
[0:43:09] <Pookiedaexzile> Life Bar go Brrr Brain dead go Boom
[0:43:10] <jorniev> im not much of a fan btw
[0:43:12] <@Menitta> Killer Instinct has the best tutorial period
[0:43:13] <MahoganyWoods> Why is everyone talking about Fate?
[0:43:13] <ManlyMcBeefington> @snakevash I say Bearzerker cause Shiro the bear
[0:43:13] <phatmac16> @devanmuse You can go to the Fate/stay night Reddit and find a safe link to download. It’s not going to hit you with a virus
[0:43:15] <%ShinobiPhoenix> literally people claiming that Wifi players should be allowed to "live in coexistence", but they ALSO are being "racist" to each other and don't want to play each other, they want to come in the game and play with people they SEE have stable connections, so really they ALONE to be allowed to play
[0:43:16] <quietshun> @jorniev people talk about fate plenty on the subreddit lol
[0:43:16] <Ghostbody> @jorniev Yep yep
[0:43:17] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> Or teaches players "study the roster"
[0:43:18] <@Menitta> It teaches so much shit
[0:43:18] <gordieda20> He burns himself using magic
[0:43:19] <MKII> I had to learn dota 2 from a guide called Welcome to Dota, You Suck it
[0:43:20] <SeruraRenge> also he burned out his mana circuits
[0:43:21] <+Lionhart16> @saintshin from what I understand, its because he used his magic circuits to a point where its literally burning his body from the inside out.
[0:43:25] <spardanwarrior> I can figure out a bnb, but I don't know what the fuck to do in neutral
[0:43:25] <MKII> s not just fighting games
[0:43:28] <lem______> also its a psychology thing
[0:43:36] <Vermillion129> Someone make that learning with manga gif where Jack stab Jeanne then have a close caption wifi player on both of them plz
[0:43:36] <devanmuse> Fate Fans were waiting for this day like Umineko fans were waiting for Golden Fantasia
[0:43:36] <KogaNoidZX> DBFZ updated it's tutorial mode with dojo stuff so I wanna see more of that in FG's
[0:43:46] <SnakeVash> Reminder that Kiara's ENTIRE PLOT is to turn the planet into her own pleasure toy.
[0:43:46] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:43:47] <lem______> its changing ppls mentality of HOW they play
[0:43:48] <Pookiedaexzile> Can make a read on me if the PAges are blank
[0:43:48] <rosabellamelantha> Reminder that Emiya Alter USED TO BE A JAPANESE BOY
[0:43:51] <+NYCrownlessKing> that is also why the community in a sense also helps ppl that info out there for you.. like the KI Guide Website.. @WoolieVersus
[0:43:56] <devanmuse> @phatmac16 I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for the tip
[0:43:56] <Pookiedaexzile> Can't make a read if aint not words on the pages
[0:43:58] <Acti0njacks0n99> Learn Good Nootch.exe
[0:44:00] <+NYCrownlessKing> so if you say "ki doesn't help me learn the game" well you have sources
[0:44:15] <+Lionhart16> @saintshin which is why you see him having golden cracks across his body in his later ascensions.
[0:44:19] <rosabellamelantha> does it count as blackface if it's literally magical burns
[0:44:20] <jorniev> who is the worst fate character? (the most hated)
[0:44:20] <Pookiedaexzile> Ya'll out here thinkin? In fighting games?
[0:44:31] <phatmac16> Columbus?
[0:44:33] <KogaNoidZX> As someone who just started learning KI a month ago the problem is finding a number of people to play lmao
[0:44:33] <subjectg> @devanmuse once woolz plays hisoutensoku again, it’ll be our turn
[0:44:37] <rosabellamelantha> most hated? uhhh it USED to be Jason but
[0:44:38] <+Lionhart16> @jorniev Shinji
[0:44:39] <+StrifeZubia> @jorniev Fuck Shinji, all my homies hate Shinji
[0:44:40] <kaminarihime3> Columbus prob
[0:44:40] <Nekros4442> uhh worst is Shinji
[0:44:41] <alrobot2014> shinji?
[0:44:41] <SnakeVash> Reminder that by the time the prologue is over, Emiya had died twice.
[0:44:42] <+Kyanta_Rojo> This is why devs are thinking heavily about new players with newer games
[0:44:43] <phatmac16> Or Shinji is the most hated
[0:44:43] <%Wool> @subjectg Calm down Touhou fans
[0:44:44] <rosabellamelantha> Shinji
[0:44:46] <haisho> worst Fate character? Either Shinji or Zouken
[0:44:46] <Vermillion129> Shinji
[0:44:46] <tiaramaki> Shinji
[0:44:46] <mr_ghoul_99> shinji
[0:44:47] <+Zasne> Let's dicuss Fate/ lore
[0:44:48] <SeruraRenge> it's not black due to melanin, it's black because his entire body is seared
[0:44:52] <bbHighvalor> shinji
[0:44:53] <KnivesEve> isnt shinji
[0:44:57] <$saintshin> thats kinda yikes hes burnt
[0:44:58] <gordieda20> Probably Zouken
[0:45:01] <am_omega> Shinji is pretty shit.
[0:45:01] <+alphonseisbest> ZOUKEN
[0:45:03] <alephalpha> shinji's the worst
[0:45:07] <+cascadepersona> Shinji is such an asshole, but he also makes me laugh my ass off.
[0:45:07] <phatmac16> Everyone wants to punch shinji
[0:45:08] <ManlyMcBeefington> @jorniev my personal hated is not shonji but he is the best pointed one
[0:45:10] <%Th3SmartAlec> Zouken, but Shinji in my heart
[0:45:15] <alephalpha> zouken's alsot he worst
[0:45:15] <lem______> Its the same as teaching people chess. You can tell someone how to move pieces, but you still gotta know openings and such
[0:45:17] <+Tainted_Ninja> Zouken is a scumbag
[0:45:21] <brunoberserk> but i not gonna lie , i see a LOT of new player ignoring tutorials
[0:45:22] <mr_ghoul_99> matous other than kariya
[0:45:24] <%0rond> shinji's bad but people forget how literally everything is kirei's fault
[0:45:26] <haisho> Zouken for horrible, Shinji for being Maximum Bitch
[0:45:28] <huskarl_zap> Remember, coom is still the most op power up servants can get. Discuss
[0:45:33] <sosuke5> Fighting games = board games is a good analogy. It's like playing chess as a noob against a grand master where you have to make a move every 0.5 seconds.
[0:45:38] <subjectg> @wool i’ll calm down when woolz stops misrepresenting the games, but i digress
[0:45:42] <SeruraRenge> ya'll talking shit about Shinji, making me want to bust out he copypasta
[0:45:45] <+alphonseisbest> Zouken rapes a child, Shinji rapes a teen... welcome to F/SN people LUL
[0:45:46] <Nekros4442> Kirei is Kirei. Kirei is charismatic evil. Shinji is just a little shit
[0:45:47] <SnakeVash> Being in the same area as Shinji made Gilgamesh want to destroy humanity. think about it
[0:45:48] <devanmuse> @0rond but Yorokobe, tho
[0:45:52] <garbageheaphound> so what are the boys talkin bout now?
[0:45:52] <KogaNoidZX> New players tend to ignore tutorials and go straight to combos and wonder why they lose to wake up super and throws
[0:45:57] <+Lionhart16> @0rond Zouken also played a good part in everything.
[0:45:58] <shadowmaksim> I feel bad for Shinji. Zouken is irredeemable.
[0:45:59] <+cascadepersona> God, I love Kirei
[0:46:00] <%Wool> Even though Unist's tutorial is very thorough, is it beginner friendly? Even as a relative long time fighting game player, I still found it to be too much to consume.
[0:46:02] <+StrifeZubia> @mr_ghoul_99 let's not forget Kariya was still a pretty big piece of shit
[0:46:09] <rosabellamelantha> Zouken is actual peak trash
[0:46:15] <kronostorm34> Who wants some mapo tofu
[0:46:17] <am_omega> The matous are shit.
[0:46:17] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @cascadepersona YOROKOBE
[0:46:18] <mr_ghoul_99> i mean he kinda lost his mind at the end
[0:46:21] <+DreyfussFrost> It's Monster Hunter.
[0:46:22] <phatmac16> Shinji feels like a real asshole while Zouken feels like a fictional villain
[0:46:28] <brunoberserk> remember when kiritsugu bombs a whole building just to kill a guy ??
[0:46:29] <ManlyMcBeefington> Kirei is the best Curry Chef
[0:46:31] <jorniev> take notice that i dont know who shinji is, but i like that all you guys know which character is the worst... so is he friends with the protag?
[0:46:32] <mr_ghoul_99> he had mental impairment at least
[0:46:32] <haisho> Kirei is the lovable kind of horrible, kinda like how people love Gil in the original Fate
[0:46:33] <huskarl_zap> Best mommy gf, go.
[0:46:34] <kaminarihime3> At least Shinji gets bodied
[0:46:36] <Pookiedaexzile> "Relevance" Aight fam, little cap there but we gonna ride
[0:46:38] <SnakeVash> Shinji IS an asshole
[0:46:41] <KogaNoidZX> UNiEL's tutorial is not beginner friendly at all lmao, it kinda dumps a lot on you and expects you to keep up with it so I definitely understand why people tap out at stuff like anti-air conversions
[0:46:44] <+Lionhart16> Also Flauros because of the Fuyuki Singularity.
[0:46:44] <phatmac16> Kirei is the best
[0:46:44] <+frozenzonata> Mortal Kombat kept it alive!
[0:46:44] <devanmuse> Carnival Phantasm couldn't even do anything with Zouken. They didn't try to make him funny
[0:46:47] <brunoberserk> yorokobe shounen
[0:46:48] <%SilverDevilfish> Woolie: Fightan James. Chat: Sakura's family is trash.
[0:46:51] <PerfectShadic> I like Sakura.
[0:46:52] <BliVru> Hey just like Warhammer fantasy before Total War
[0:46:52] <lucky_icarus> Somehow Shinji IS friends with the protag
[0:46:52] <%Irridium> honestly most important thing in fighting games is neutral and that's something you can only really learn from experience.
[0:46:53] <+cascadepersona> @kosorsomesaykosm_ REJOICE
[0:46:56] <@Solidus_113> street fighta foooooooour
[0:46:56] <sosuke5> I know all I want to know about Fate and I don't want to know any more for fear of ruining it.
[0:47:01] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[0:47:01] <Vermillion129> @brunoberserk yes, it was grea- i mean it was horrible
[0:47:03] <$saintshin> fate doesnt tend to have the most grey characters like its super clear whos cartoonishly evil
[0:47:08] <Pookiedaexzile> Shinji IS an asshole, and you should be disgusted by him, as you should be disgusted by yourself
[0:47:08] <rosabellamelantha> remember how Gil used to be a rapist and then fate spent the ENTIRE SERIES walking that back
[0:47:12] <@Moobot> Please don't fill up the entire chat, @SeruraRenge
[0:47:16] <e1io> YAW
[0:47:16] <phatmac16> “I like Kotomine Kirei” - Shirou Emiya
[0:47:16] <ManlyMcBeefington> @huskarl_zap I don't use her enough but personality I like Bodicua
[0:47:23] <rosabellamelantha> Like Gil got MULTIPLE GAMES walking back how shitty he was in FSN
[0:47:25] <Ghostbody> BODIED
[0:47:29] <gordieda20> Shinji was friends with Shirou
[0:47:32] <SnakeVash> Shinji is a rapist and should be hated.
[0:47:45] <+TopTieramisu> yeaaaaaaah. shinji is forever a pos
[0:47:45] <+StrifeZubia> Everything after FSN has been a progressive walk-back on Gil and it's been awful
[0:47:47] <garbageheaphound> man the chat is a whole different conversation
[0:47:47] <+alphonseisbest> @SnakeVash so is Zouken
[0:47:48] <Pookiedaexzile> That's the point of the show, thats the last sentence in the movie
[0:47:48] <%0rond> @huskarl_zap musashi
[0:47:50] <haisho> Shinji was "friends" with Shirou. Everyone could see Shinji was being an asshole
[0:47:51] <phatmac16> ALL MY HOMIES HATE SHINJI
[0:47:52] <jorniev> gilgamesh WAS a total piece of shit in his legend though
[0:47:53] <Raldavar> With my dying breath, I blame Sachin!
[0:47:53] <%SilverDevilfish> Like have we just heard Woolie talk about this so much we just kind of tune him out until he's done?
[0:47:54] <e1io> fate aka tsukihime aka melty blood
[0:47:58] <lucky_icarus> The fact that Shinji doesn't die in every route is a crime against humanity
[0:48:03] <+egalitarian696969> Fighting games outlived RTSs NotLikeThis
[0:48:06] <+GrenchVicte> @rosabellamelantha Walking back, or trying to better explain the corruption of the Tainted Grail on him?
[0:48:06] <huskarl_zap> tbh i dont know those names i only know, Raikou , Boudica , nero, Astolfo Atilla
[0:48:07] <subjectg> i enjoy how we’re just discussing matou family issues while woolie’s going on his thesis here
[0:48:08] <SeruraRenge> Shinji is too much of a joke to be effectively hateable
[0:48:08] <+alphonseisbest> YO LAST BLADE SWERY 4TW
[0:48:10] <phatmac16> @silverdevilfish Yes talk about fate
[0:48:11] <quietshun> @silverdevilfish yeah
[0:48:11] <shadowmaksim> There is more complexity to Shinji that people tend to overlook. But at the end, Zouken is the one that is the root cause for a lot of the terrible crap that happens.
[0:48:13] <%JohnAtDawn> Shirou literally broke Shinji's nose when he found out he was hitting Sakura, and he was completely willing to kill him during the War
[0:48:13] <ManlyMcBeefington> @rosabellamelantha is we tak Hil like a Greek god it makes sense on the horrible acts he did
[0:48:18] <sendart> I want Caster Gil to pound me
[0:48:20] <+Lionhart16> @saintshin what's weird is that the FGO honestly has a pretty good number of characters that are in a Grey area, especially in the Lostbelts.
[0:48:21] <Pookiedaexzile> Oh diffferent shinji
[0:48:23] <rosabellamelantha> UBW is almost the best route but shinji lives
[0:48:25] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> bruh there's like 8 different conversations happening in this chat lmao
[0:48:26] <Pookiedaexzile> continue
[0:48:35] <Pookiedaexzile> Are all shinjis disgusting
[0:48:36] <phatmac16> Hf is easily the best route
[0:48:37] <haisho> @rosabellamelantha he eats the most shit in that route though
[0:48:41] <garbageheaphound> fate route is the best route
[0:48:43] <SnakeVash> HF is the best Route
[0:48:46] <+TopTieramisu> rin is best route
[0:48:46] <haisho> Extra Shinji is alright
[0:48:47] <+Meidolaon> @StrifeZubia To be fair, even in FSN proper they're pretty explicit about Gilgamesh not having behaved like that in the Fourth Grail War and having been corrupted by the Grail
[0:48:48] <%0rond> extra shinji is forgiveable
[0:48:48] <GothicLolitaAngel> Yeah Shinji sucks worst character
[0:48:53] <subjectg> ubw is best route
[0:48:54] <garbageheaphound> the other routes are great too
[0:48:56] <kaminarihime3> fate extra shinji redeems himself but thats someone else
[0:48:58] <rosabellamelantha> Extra Shinji is 8
[0:49:00] <%BallerSwagBro9k> The only good Shinji is a dead Shinji
[0:49:00] <sosuke5> It is indeed a miracle fighting games survived
[0:49:03] <%Wool> The state of fighting games is better now than it has been in a while at least.
[0:49:05] <rosabellamelantha> don't blame the 8 year old
[0:49:05] <+psychocalibur> rin best girl
[0:49:06] <SnakeVash> Extra Shinji is only 8 years old
[0:49:08] <+alphonseisbest> @BallerSwagBro9k TRUTH#
[0:49:11] <$saintshin> Grand order at times really has some good shit more than the usual its crazy
[0:49:15] <%Pigg1yJuffs> @rosabellamelantha UBW is more than likely Shirou's best ending in terms of growth and the future. It doesn't mean it's the best ending for everyone.
[0:49:15] <phatmac16> Saber best girl
[0:49:15] <%Irridium> hey at least fighting games aren't dead like RTS games
[0:49:18] <+Meidolaon> Last Encore Shinji was right though
[0:49:18] <+cascadepersona> Alright, but here's the biggest controversy: Who is the best Saber?
[0:49:18] <%Neryl_> Neryl_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[0:49:21] <shadowmaksim> I guess most people don't know about "HA" Shinji?
[0:49:21] <ManlyMcBeefington> HF route has more Kirei so I prefer that one
[0:49:22] <@Solidus_113> Fighting Games should've had the MOBA popularity LUL
[0:49:27] <+NYCrownlessKing> you nerds still talking about that horrible show Fate? Kappa
[0:49:27] <%0rond> best saber or best artoria
[0:49:27] <KogaNoidZX> Fighting games are way better now than they were like 2001-2007
[0:49:31] <+alphonseisbest> ^
[0:49:31] <SnakeVash> Nero is the best Saber
[0:49:31] <haisho> Extra Shinji is also not extraordinary piece of shit
[0:49:31] <sendart> MHX is the best saber Kappa
[0:49:32] <phatmac16> Artoria
[0:49:33] <huskarl_zap> there are 20 sabers
[0:49:33] <jorniev> the thing i only care about in fate is gilgamesh vs enkidu . did they do anything with that?
[0:49:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Btw LB 6 is probably very soon
[0:49:39] <Ghostbody> Grass roots
[0:49:40] <SeruraRenge> @cascadepersona Lancer Alter
[0:49:40] <%0rond> MHXX is best saber
[0:49:41] <+TopTieramisu> arcueid is best saber
[0:49:41] <kaminarihime3> Nero is best saber fite mi
[0:49:45] <KnivesEve> Musahi is best saber
[0:49:47] <Pookiedaexzile> Fighting games will never Die, but don't kid yourself those fuck ups made fighting games niche when they should be mainstream
[0:49:50] <%wibbwobbler> wibbwobbler subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! very nice. good stuff.
[0:49:50] <+psychocalibur> nero best saber
[0:49:52] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> at one point, all fighting games were kusoge Kappa
[0:49:55] <moonknight98> can you play jojo's all star battle
[0:49:58] <+cascadepersona> @serurarenge Your taste... is exquisite
[0:49:59] <%GalacticaPhanto> anything regarding Stay Night and on with Sakura legit makes me depressed and it's the reason I dont dabble with Fate as much as I used to
[0:50:00] <%0rond> "which eldtrich god possess you?" "Capitalism"
[0:50:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ALTERA BEST SABER
[0:50:02] <@Solidus_113> big play button
[0:50:04] <Visored34> Mordred best saber
[0:50:05] <+alphonseisbest> Fighting Games have come a long way since PAC PAC MAN
[0:50:08] <%Wool> I hope League Fighter helps move fighting games into the mainstream.
[0:50:12] <e1io> This is such a good convo, will it be in the youtube vid too?
[0:50:13] <haisho> @0rond That was so dumb I loved it
[0:50:15] <+psychocalibur> mordred 2nd best
[0:50:18] <phatmac16> @jorniev They go over that in the Babylonia anime
[0:50:21] <@Solidus_113> League Fighter better do magic
[0:50:24] <rosabellamelantha> Santa Altera is cute
[0:50:25] <rosabellamelantha> baaaaa
[0:50:26] <+Meidolaon> Best Saber by raw damage is Caesar
[0:50:27] <SnakeVash> Mordred is pretty up there
[0:50:29] <+alphonseisbest> Man I WANT THAT LEAGUE FIGHT GAME BAD!
[0:50:30] <+Lionhart16> @saintshin yup. it's one of the very few games I'm consistently interested in because of how good it's story and writing can be.
[0:50:37] <%0rond> @Meidolaon don't remind me please
[0:50:37] <%Pigg1yJuffs> !uptime
[0:50:37] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 50 minutes and 48 seconds
[0:50:37] <ManlyMcBeefington> @ballerswagbro9k Altera is great, she is best Christmas alter
[0:50:40] <Ghostbody> @e1io it'll probably be a separate vid
[0:50:48] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> we talking about Max's MVC3 Lives tourney?
[0:50:48] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:50:50] <e1io> That's good enough tbh
[0:50:55] <+TopTieramisu> pong is the first fighting game
[0:50:57] <%Wool> if League Fighter is free and has good netcode, it could do a lot to help fighting games.
[0:50:58] <jorniev> oh right NERO is a girl in this too! so what up with that?
[0:50:59] <+Meidolaon> Also can't back Musashi, she's a pedo
[0:51:01] <haisho> reminder that Teardrop Photon Ray is Altera parrying Ares' laser
[0:51:05] <Vermillion129> @qu3kl41n_the_impure_king fighting game in general
[0:51:09] <+Jaysky> cirFairy Padoru
[0:51:11] <%Pigg1yJuffs> Omg, Woolie has been on this for almost an hour. I love his enthusiasm, but god damn Woolie.
[0:51:15] <$saintshin> @Lionhart16 i kinda spoiled myself since im just in okeanos but its some good shit
[0:51:16] <+psychocalibur> umu!
[0:51:18] <rosabellamelantha> I like how Woolie is talking fighting games and chat is just going full fate discussion
[0:51:19] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> @Vermillion129 gotcha
[0:51:19] <SnakeVash> Nero was a known crossdresser irl
[0:51:25] <SeruraRenge> Musashi canon rapes little boys but that's /ss/ so it's fine
[0:51:26] <phatmac16> Musashi isn’t a pedo she just likes pretty boys
[0:51:32] <%Wool> @Pigg1yJuffs This is way more interesting than Fate imo
[0:51:36] <rosabellamelantha> No she's into shota
[0:51:36] <%Irridium> Nero the Deadweight?
[0:51:39] <jorniev> just talk about nero chrismas meme to brute force him into starting
[0:51:42] <maskedmook> @rosabellamelantha that's been my thought this whole time
[0:51:44] <%0rond> she is a shotacon in a non sexual way... I think...
[0:51:44] <ManlyMcBeefington> @jorniev also Strange Fake has more Gil and Enkidu
[0:51:47] <%Th3SmartAlec> @pigg1yjuffs if he has to deal with our Fate shit we gotta deal with his fighting game shit LUL
[0:51:49] <rosabellamelantha> much like the voice actors Musashi is very much into shota
[0:51:54] <phatmac16> Doujins are canon my dude
[0:51:57] <rosabellamelantha> the fate voice actors LOVE shota btw
[0:52:00] <gordieda20> LUL
[0:52:01] <phatmac16> Aren’t canon
[0:52:02] <sendart> Can't wait til Nero bride gets her np charge interlude
[0:52:04] <+alphonseisbest> @SeruraRenge she hasn't raped anyone WTF are u smoking? 0-0
[0:52:06] <+Meidolaon> @phatmac16 She said the 15-year-old Fuma Kotarou was too old for her in Shimousa and hit on Lolivinci the second she came back in the Lostbelts
[0:52:06] <Pookiedaexzile> @SnakeVash Jackpot
[0:52:12] <%0rond> oh yeah, the shota alliance that np5s every shota whatever it takes
[0:52:14] <$saintshin> in fate what ive learned is that everything is cannon and also not cannon at the same time
[0:52:15] <%Pigg1yJuffs> It's fair, I kinda have him on in the background.
[0:52:21] <rosencruez> @rosabellamelantha Aoi Yuuki being the most vocal about it
[0:52:22] <Estuko> @rosabellamelantha oh
[0:52:24] <+cascadepersona> I'm remembering the Nero Claudius DMC V mod and smiling
[0:52:31] <brunoberserk> i learned to play guilty gear and melty blood with youtube tutorials
[0:52:32] <SeruraRenge> Aoi Yuuki only likes shotas because it's the only boys she can look at evenly on eye level, the womanlet
[0:52:39] <haisho> I thought it was Rieri?
[0:52:40] <+Lionhart16> @saintshin And jokes can be deepest lore.
[0:52:41] <SableS139a> @rosabellamelantha jiyuGrin
[0:52:43] <%0rond> both of them
[0:52:44] <%Pigg1yJuffs> Long winded, Woolie you talked for an hour.
[0:52:44] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> So we gonna play?
[0:52:44] <rosabellamelantha> it's hilarious that people don't know this
[0:52:53] <SnakeVash> When we say Nero, we're talking about the 5th Emperor of Roma, FYI
[0:52:54] <subjectg> whatever happened to aoi yuuki’s project shota anyway?
[0:53:00] <%0rond> still on going
[0:53:00] <%Wool> Until tutorials are improved enough, the best ways to learn fighting games besides just playing are through Youtube and Discord, imo
[0:53:03] <KogaNoidZX> tbh I'd rather hear this than fate discussion anyway lmao
[0:53:03] <Pookiedaexzile> Don't care
[0:53:06] <FrostedZaibatsu> Imagine people not liking the banter of Woolie and Reggie
[0:53:07] <%0rond> every shota np5 like a clock
[0:53:10] <SeruraRenge> I once made a very similar joke on a dating website. Messaging a 5'0 kindergarten worker, I asked her "did you take the job because you could be the tallest in the room?" Needless to say I didn't fuck.
[0:53:10] <Estuko> FeelsBadMan only think I know about fate is fate stay night from when I watched it once years ago
[0:53:14] <phatmac16> This is gonna go all night at this rate
[0:53:15] <kaminarihime3> woolie reallyyyyy doesnt want to play fate
[0:53:17] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> let's hope fighting games get into fighting games
[0:53:23] <Pookiedaexzile> Nah we're used to hour long front parts
[0:53:25] <garbageheaphound> Woolie that was a good talk
[0:53:26] <YaminoRaiden> @jorniev most cases are history not being accurate, but in the case of emperor Nero, it is because of the political conspiracy from their rule and the destruction of their sculptures
[0:53:26] <Ghostbody> Fate people, sit down.
[0:53:28] <SableS139a> @SeruraRenge LUL LUL LUL
[0:53:28] <%0rond> @WoolieVersus no one says that people are too busy talking about fate
[0:53:30] <brunoberserk> woolie if you lookeing in the chat smile when you see the geese dnoGEESE
[0:53:30] <SnakeVash> We Accept the Discussion

[0:54:21] <+Spider1991> *king
[0:54:25] <DartAran> This talk is fine, it's a little game delay, just like playing on wifi
[0:54:25] <rmwolfe> fightm gam
[0:54:26] <sendart> wait this isn't a fate chat room with Woolie ASMR?
[0:54:30] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I don't understand people who pretend people have nothing to say and you have to make it into 240 character sound bites
[0:54:31] <+Lionhart16> @jorniev it's probably one of the biggest IPs in Japan, so its not surprising.
[0:54:34] <gordieda20> we were just talking its fine
[0:54:35] <+alphonseisbest> hits too close to home
[0:54:35] <VritraReiRei> @WoolieVersus apply the same rules Pat/Paige does, every time someone asks when the game starts delay it another half hour LUL
[0:54:41] <+Pigg1yJuffs> It's fair, I'm passionate too. I kinda tuned out though as one of those people who doesn't have control over WiFi and the like. Made worse by no public scene where I am. No fronting on ya. @woolieversus
[0:54:41] <%Wool> It's disappointing to see chat be like this
[0:54:42] <dustyjordans> is this going to be a video?

[1:02:37] <Tr1pkT12> Proto CU abuff never
[1:02:38] <WholesomeSandwhichPeddler> One day ArcSys will make a Fate fighting game and will obtain money
[1:02:43] <%JohnAtDawn> Wait, why is this is Japanese?
[1:02:44] <+alphonseisbest> @SnakeVash ALSO A GOOD CHOICE
[1:02:45] <+Meidolaon> Hell, it's her NP in FGO too, since she's Astraea's vessel
[1:02:46] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @SeruraRenge
[1:02:48] <0cash> prototype has been abandoned
[1:02:56] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @wholesomesandwhichpeddler Im shocked it hasn't happened yet

[1:03:06] <SableS139a> @SnakeVash You spent your Grails on best Rin-Face? Good pick, my dude.
[1:03:07] <phatmac16> OHOHOHOHOH
[1:03:09] <%Th3SmartAlec> I just remembered Run is a punchgirl in disguise
[1:03:11] <Vermillion129> reggie running out of gems bruh
[1:03:17] <phatmac16> GOT A BIG LANCE
[1:03:18] <+TopTieramisu> rin flexing her blood diamonds
[1:03:22] <+hod_fareview> Tohsaka pleases old men for money
[1:03:24] <%Jack8274> I used to play this every day in Comm tech class in high school! Holy shit flash back
[1:03:24] <StarlitStunner> Wild Dog versus Defenseless
[1:03:25] <rosabellamelantha> Rin is a punchgirl that specced into ranged attacks
[1:03:26] <TheSaltminer> Reggie, you're gonna run out of those gems man
[1:03:28] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[1:03:31] <rosencruez> big stick for big bois
[1:03:32] <phatmac16> BLOOD DAIMONDS
[1:03:44] <Alta_Bossun> Lancer is literally kilik
[1:03:45] <SeruraRenge> Kirei trained her wrong on purpose, as a joke
[1:03:46] <dmtjinni> Someone did their research PogChamp
[1:03:48] <phatmac16> GAE BOLG
[1:03:48] <+ondri21> @WoolieVersus you have no idea how crazy this game is, watch some matches sometime
[1:03:52] <GrumbleGrouse> big stick always OP
[1:03:57] <TheSaltminer> Rin is a SFXT character
[1:03:59] <haisho> pretty sure the Tohsaka family did martial arts as a thing
[1:04:00] <subjectg> Tohsaka probably got her magic from SS occult shenanigans in ww2
[1:04:01] <+Arnschen> Oh no
[1:04:02] <gordieda20> Big Stab
[1:04:03] <hassanico2> Oh shit we need to somehow get them to do the Lancer Vs Bazett Counter LUL
[1:04:03] <devanmuse> Lancer is the best. He has an attack that alters destiny so that it never misses... and he still manages to miss
[1:04:08] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> long range reach LUL
[1:04:08] <brunoberserk> @SeruraRenge LUL
[1:04:10] <rosabellamelantha> Rin has a black void under her skirt apparently
[1:04:15] <kaminarihime3> Kirei taught her
[1:04:16] <BoneBagMel> Doesn't this game have some DISGUSTING bullshit tech?
[1:04:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Reminder that Lancers NP literally gives you the GAE
[1:04:20] <StarlitStunner> Gotta use that super bajiquan Kirei didn’t teach you nemuSmug
[1:04:30] <%RyuuAoi> Let's play the range....game....I love you...let's play the range...game...
[1:04:30] <hassanico2> @BoneBagMel if Archer pulls his full chant he wins
[1:04:35] <0cash> defenseless....
[1:04:36] <phatmac16> SHES A PUNCH GIRL
[1:04:38] <SnakeVash> They're gems she's throwing.
[1:04:38] <jorniev> SHOOT GEMS TSUN GIRL!
[1:04:39] <sendart> Kirei taught her wrong as a joke
[1:04:41] <rosabellamelantha> Kirei is the worst which is why he's the best
[1:04:42] <+Meidolaon> The Gay Buldge
[1:04:43] <+StrifeZubia> @devanmuse turns out E-rank Luck alters fate in teh opposite direction
[1:04:43] <+egalitarian696969> prime kusoge
[1:04:47] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> D E F E N S E L E S S
[1:04:49] <%Pigg1yJuffs> Can someone remind me if Lancer luck ever stopped sucking shit?
[1:04:50] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:04:52] <+mashinchaserr> No healing
[1:04:55] <SableS139a> N O H E A L I N G
[1:04:56] <+toastybites> Lancer the ultimate cockroach
[1:04:57] <e1io> 3d Melty Blood let's go
[1:04:59] <gordieda20> NO
[1:05:01] <+TopTieramisu> Lancer Kane
[1:05:02] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @pigg1yjuffs NOPE
[1:05:02] <e1io> (ok not really)
[1:05:04] <phatmac16> CU BEST BOY
[1:05:09] <mr_red117> @Pigg1yJuffs never
[1:05:10] <hassanico2> oh no they need sheets for this
[1:05:10] <kaminarihime3> Cu has the friendship of the thighs
[1:05:11] <%asakura_ayase> Cu says no healing
[1:05:12] <ManlyMcBeefington> best soggo
[1:05:16] <jorniev> i hear that guys gets killed a lot
[1:05:16] <Vermillion129> @Pigg1yJuffs if Cu only no, only a couple of lancer has high luck iirc
[1:05:17] <ManlyMcBeefington> doggo*
[1:05:17] <+hod_fareview> Is that Mario Mario? Kappa
[1:05:18] <%alcors_wisdom> FATE LORE: mana is regenerated with threesomes
[1:05:20] <MaxXtreme23> Grail is right under the timer
[1:05:20] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[1:05:22] <+TopTieramisu> how is lancer a cockroach? he dies more often than not
[1:05:25] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> hes getting hot for FATE
[1:05:27] <StarlitStunner> Scathach taught him to cheat
[1:05:27] <haisho> wait how did Lancer win
[1:05:28] <jorniev> @alcors_wisdom WHAT
[1:05:29] <maskedmook> cant escape Fate
[1:05:31] <YakumoYomi> Fate's getting Woolie all hot and bothered
[1:05:31] <+GrenchVicte> I know they're not gonna get UBW, but it is enticing to see what Ults they will pull off.
[1:05:32] <$saintshin> lancer dies but also no
[1:05:33] <phatmac16> Cu’s lance doesn’t allow you to heal
[1:05:34] <powerprotoman> for a 2d fate fighter look up "FATE SWORD DANCE"
[1:05:34] <%RyuuAoi> Holy Grail - Jay Z
[1:05:35] <+hod_fareview> MANA IS STORED IN THE BALLS
[1:05:37] <+NecDW4> Woolie plays Fate for 5 minutes, immediately starts stripping
[1:05:37] <SableS139a> @alcors_wisdom AKA the best way to refuel
[1:05:39] <SeruraRenge> the greatest Lancer is the Launcher class
[1:05:47] <@Menitta> I bet 5000 on Blue
[1:05:47] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Imagine Dio vs Gilgamesh
[1:05:50] <dustyjordans> LUL
[1:05:51] <rosabellamelantha> DO Gil vs BASAKA
[1:05:51] <%RyuuAoi> Uh oh Woolie took the jacket off!
[1:05:52] <alephalpha> The nasuvers eneevr end swoole
[1:05:52] <hassanico2> Karna greatest lancer in da world
[1:05:53] <huskarl_zap> MANA IS STORED IN THE BALLS
[1:05:54] <shadowmaksim> The funny thing is that every game that features Lancer/Cu, he's always top tier. It's to counterbalance his terrible luck in the show.
[1:06:03] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Or Ozy vs Dio Kappa Kappa Kappa
[1:06:07] <%SilverDevilfish> Woolie you should have Reggie guess who Saber is Kappa
[1:06:09] <StarlitStunner> Mapo tofu is stored in the balls
[1:06:12] <+alphonseisbest> YUP
[1:06:13] <subjectg> Gotta throw cu a bone someday
[1:06:14] <+Jaysky> O K
[1:06:14] <TheSaltminer> Lancer is the Irish hero Cu Chulainn
[1:06:15] <rosabellamelantha> if you knew who achilles was you'd shoot his heel
[1:06:17] <phatmac16> They’re heroes from legend
[1:06:18] <%Th3SmartAlec> and some people are SHIT at hiding it LUL
[1:06:18] <devanmuse> If you're fighting someone named "Achilles" you kind of know to aim for his heel
[1:06:19] <haisho> literally because knowing their names means knowing how they died
[1:06:19] <+frankyvalli> If you say your name people could know how they fight
[1:06:20] <+toastybites> @TopTieramisu because in Grand Order most of his abilities help him barely survive challenge missions
[1:06:20] <rosabellamelantha> for example
[1:06:22] <mr_red117> hide name to hide big weakness
[1:06:24] <alrobot2014> @StarlitStunner i don't want kirei to eat my balls
[1:06:26] <SnakeVash> imagine if someone said your name was Achilles. You think you know the weakness maybe?
[1:06:28] <+cascadepersona> We made Cu Top Tier, you know, as a joke
[1:06:30] <hassanico2> Cu's costume wasn't this black ever?
[1:06:31] <MaxXtreme23> FATE LORE: Jesus's disciples in Fate fought with an offshoot of boxing and generally solved problems by punching shit really hard.
[1:06:31] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> he would fit tbh
[1:06:33] <phatmac16> They hide them in order to hide their weaknesses like Achilles
[1:06:37] <Monkeyweed21> Are you UMUing your Padoru
[1:06:38] <%RyuuAoi> Lancer for SMASH
[1:06:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> FATE HAS MULTIPLE JOJO CHARACTERS
[1:06:41] <+Meidolaon> I mean there's some JoJo-tier designs like QSH
[1:06:42] <haisho> Their names are literally z-targetable weaknesses
[1:06:42] <+TopTieramisu> lancer's gae bolg is pretty jojoesque
[1:06:42] <jorniev> LANCER NEEDS more holes
[1:06:45] <Fear_Ranjer> Yoooooo this is badass
[1:06:46] <%Pigg1yJuffs> Again, Woolie likes Tsukihime and Melty Blood. They are both nearly as degenerate as Fate. What exactly turned him off other than fan cringe?
[1:06:48] <+egalitarian696969> type moon is into minimalism
[1:06:49] <hassanico2> St. Martha beats up dragons with her bare hands, it's bitchin'
[1:06:49] <Halospaz117> @hassanico2 Woolie's using an Alt color
[1:06:49] <phatmac16> Fate is pretty much Jojo
[1:06:50] <+NecDW4> Oh, Lancer's got some holes in him Woolie, don't worry
[1:06:50] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Cu alter is basically a stand already
[1:06:50] <manwithaxe> yeah, people know who ya really are they know how to scre with ya. imagine if everyone ya fought knew ya were Achilles
[1:06:53] <+eanscrale> Or he could just wear a sailor uniform
[1:06:54] <TheSaltminer> The running premise is that if someone knows your true identity, they know how to kill you, so you hide behind your class name
[1:06:55] <StarlitStunner> @alrobot2014 Yorokobe shonen!
[1:07:04] <brunoberserk> best death battle : diavolo vs lancer
[1:07:08] <phatmac16> GAR BULGE
[1:07:11] <rosencruez> because if you know their real names, you know how they died/how to kill them
[1:07:12] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> thats so cheap lmao
[1:07:14] <phatmac16> GAE BULGE
[1:07:15] <townzzzzz> big heals
[1:07:16] <am_omega> Fate Lore: Jacob made a fighting style based on that time he wrestled a angel. Desiples of said style will eventually beat Lucifer's ass.
[1:07:17] <lucky_icarus> @pigg1yjuffs The fucking fans insisting he try and like it and shit
[1:07:19] <Brutalyte616> Someone please show Woolie a clip of Cleopatra posing...
[1:07:20] <alrobot2014> @StarlitStunner oh god that made me choke
[1:07:20] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> RUNES
[1:07:21] <+Jaysky> Hence why Saber hid her sword for so long
[1:07:23] <hassanico2> oooh the runes
[1:07:26] <jorniev> i liked the LANCER from fate zero, cool dude... shame how he went out
[1:07:26] <SnakeVash> Ruin Barrier
[1:07:26] <%alcors_wisdom> FATE LORE: the reason theyre referred to as their classes is to hide the personalities and weaknesses of their true nature and also to avoid giving away what their "Noble Phantasm" (ultimate move) could be
[1:07:27] <%Th3SmartAlec> ...chat,is Achilles actually a character in Fate? curious
[1:07:33] <rosabellamelantha> yes
[1:07:34] <am_omega> Yes
[1:07:35] <rosabellamelantha> he's a rider
[1:07:35] <Ner234> @Th3SmartAlec Yes
[1:07:35] <alephalpha> yes
[1:07:35] <+SirTrae> @Th3SmartAlec Yep

[1:07:41] <fairore> yes
[1:07:42] <lucky_icarus> yeah, he's OP as fuck
[1:07:43] <KnivesEve> yep
[1:07:46] <+toastybites> @Th3SmartAlec yeh and he gets into a fist fight with Chiron
[1:07:46] <TheSaltminer> yeah, Achilles is a Rider class
[1:07:47] <am_omega> He is a cool dude.
[1:07:48] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Th3SmartAlec yep, he's pretty cool too
[1:07:49] <haisho> yeah and he's getting shit from a certain Berserker
[1:07:49] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @th3smartalec Yes hes in Fate Apocrypha
[1:07:49] <SjoeB89> @Th3SmartAlec Yes
[1:07:51] <Fear_Ranjer> OOF
[1:07:51] <+FeralRageGaming> who will win? the Irish Hero with the Destiny altering spear, or... a Japanese schoolgirl?
[1:07:52] <phatmac16> He’s badass
[1:07:53] <+Meidolaon> Yep, he looks like a white, green-haired Orga too
[1:07:55] <+mashinchaserr> has anyone told woolie saint martha is a punchgirl yet
[1:07:56] <jubejube56> If you can name them, they are in fate.
[1:07:58] <KogaNoidZX> And Thomas Edison is a dope ass furry in FGO apparently
[1:07:59] <jphuty> look up achilles vs chiron on yt
[1:08:00] <%Th3SmartAlec> thanks chat
[1:08:02] <jubejube56> If you can't name them, they are also in fate
[1:08:08] <alakazavartin> Because of course its fate
[1:08:09] <SnakeVash> Mordred called Achilles a carrot once
[1:08:10] <hassanico2> What is Cu's runes move here?
[1:08:13] <+Meidolaon> Fate's got tons of punchgirls tbh
[1:08:16] <Pookiedaexzile> Wha is this game

[1:08:37] <Ner234> That spear is bullshit
[1:08:39] <alephalpha> reversing causality
[1:08:40] <shadowmaksim> There is no online.
[1:08:41] <SeruraRenge> If you know a hero's true name then you know their weakness based on how their died in their legend.
[1:08:44] <phatmac16> WORKED FOR THE FIRST TIME

[1:09:33] <YaminoRaiden> I guess we just saying it. Rider is Medusa
[1:09:36] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> YEYE
[1:09:37] <SnakeVash> Medusa's known for turning people to stone with her eyes
[1:09:39] <haisho> wouldn't it be sick if Medusa had Pandemonium Cetus as a super in this game?
[1:09:41] <%JohnAtDawn> Punchgirls in Fate are all strong
[1:09:42] <brunoberserk> rider is super is broken in this game right ?
[1:09:43] <KnivesEve> doesnt medusa have jiggle physics in this game
[1:09:44] <hassanico2> We gonna get Fragarach vs Gae Bolg in this stream? Bets anyone? Kappa
[1:09:44] <am_omega> Rider has a divekick
[1:09:45] <phatmac16> BAZETT IS THE BEST
[1:09:47] <+Meidolaon> Bazett's the master of Avenger in Hollow Ataraxia, @jorniev
[1:09:51] <+amurter19> I watched zero and I've and still lfeels liek I know nothing about fate
[1:09:52] <StarlitStunner> Fragarach!
[1:09:54] <+alphonseisbest> BAZETT THE GREATEST WHEN DW
[1:09:54] <SjoeB89> Bazett Looks Like Vanessa from KOF
[1:09:55] <%FuqBoiSlim> FuqBoiSlim subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! ONE YEAR BABY LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[1:09:57] <devanmuse> So can someone explain the logic of Medusa being a Rider, again? That never made sense to me, on a surface level
[1:09:58] <ThatButler> Have they ever activated the cup yet?
[1:09:59] <rmwolfe> isnt lancer busted in this game?
[1:09:59] <phatmac16> USING LUGH’s WAR GOD SWIRD
[1:10:02] <+TopTieramisu> punch boy is the best in UBW
[1:10:03] <jorniev> @Meidolaon OK... i guess
[1:10:06] <lucky_icarus> Pegasus
[1:10:09] <Udongein_1> medusa rides Pegasus
[1:10:12] <Ner234> @hassanico2 That's such a cool interactin that they put in the game
[1:10:12] <ashbirds> pegasus came from medusa's blood
[1:10:14] <%RyuuAoi> Rider seems like she got combos for days though.
[1:10:15] <am_omega> Because of the pegasus that comes from her neck.
[1:10:15] <+toastybites> @devanmuse Because her rider form has Pegasus
[1:10:20] <GypsyMagi> It's funny because Bazett is a massive Lancer fangirl
[1:10:24] <%Jack8274> I remember a dedicated throw button
[1:10:26] <%Pigg1yJuffs> @devanmuse I think it had something to do with her actual Gorgon form breaking the class system.
[1:10:26] <hassanico2> @Ner234 it's the best, you don't see that anymore
[1:10:30] <rosabellamelantha> if you were expecting lamia Medusa that would be Gorgon who is an avenger
[1:10:34] <garbageheaphound> nice round reggie
[1:10:37] <SjoeB89> Vanessa?
[1:10:43] <+Meidolaon> @devanmuse Officially she rides Bellephoron, the winged horse
[1:10:43] <+cascadepersona> @amurter19 If you haven't watched Fate/Stay Night, that's where the real meat and potatoes is. Just disregard FGO stuff for your own sanity for now.
[1:10:44] <phatmac16> Bazett is OP as fuck for a human
[1:10:44] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I like how we're all discussing Fate Lore like Gentlemen
[1:10:50] <+alphonseisbest> So who else would turn WHALE for Bazett in FGO?
[1:10:52] <phatmac16> FATE LORE BEST LORE
[1:10:56] <rosabellamelantha> Rider is basically medusa before she became gorgon
[1:11:01] <phatmac16> I would
[1:11:04] <SnakeVash> we're not going to see her son, Pegasus, huh?
[1:11:04] <Fear_Ranjer> TRAPPING??
[1:11:07] <+DarthRevan0609> FRAGARCH
[1:11:09] <jphuty> bazett deserves to be in fgo

[1:11:34] <phatmac16> SICK
[1:11:48] <%FuqBoiSlim> Based Babette?
[1:11:49] <%JohnAtDawn> P and K are a uniqe character buff
[1:11:50] <$saintshin> The first bit of fate lore i ever learned was how mordred was born and man. :(
[1:11:51] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:11:57] <phatmac16> REGGIE USE YOUR SPECIAL
[1:11:58] <DSD24> Yoooooo Woolie's playing Fate!
[1:11:58] <%Jack8274> Damn she's cute
[1:12:02] <%RyuuAoi> So.....defense against Bazett?
[1:12:02] <Djinnazz> right in the baby maker
[1:12:03] <phatmac16> WOOLIE IS IN
[1:12:04] <Monkeyweed21> Girls in suits is top tier
[1:12:04] <Fear_Ranjer> Gooood Bazett is AWESOME
[1:12:08] <StarlitStunner> Primordial Runes in the gloves, baby!
[1:12:12] <phatmac16> BAZETT IS THE BEST
[1:12:13] <maskedmook> Bazett deserves more love
[1:12:18] <+Meidolaon> Bazett's a counter character too, hilariously
[1:12:22] <phatmac16> SHE HAS THE SWORD OF A WAR GOD
[1:12:22] <+frankyvalli> Woolie Vs: Get Into Fate
[1:12:24] <laserbeaming> What I learnt from looking at chat is the following: Don't ask questions about Fate. You're better off not knowing
[1:12:27] <+hod_fareview> OnlyHands
[1:12:28] <SeruraRenge> She got into the grail war purely because she wanted to summon Cu so he could fuck her brains out. That did not end up happening
[1:12:32] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> Skrull?
[1:12:40] <keogamer> really" i thought Assassin was the counter character
[1:12:45] <DSD24> @laserbeaming I mean just take a look at Pat, that DIDN"T go well
[1:12:48] <+hod_fareview> @SeruraRenge She wanted his mana reserves
[1:12:50] <phatmac16> Bazett has the ultimate counter move
[1:12:51] <%Pigg1yJuffs> Bazett deserves more love as what I would consider Fate's version of magical mercenaries.
[1:12:51] <BreakersAweigh> do no ask questions about fate it'll just go awfukl
[1:12:56] <%RyuuAoi> Like Bazett looks like she should have a gun. Her guns are her fists!
[1:13:02] <+cascadepersona> If they made a new Fate Fighting Game, my only request would be for them to add Shiki Ryougi cause she is raw
[1:13:03] <ThatButler> Reggie, master of the low kick
[1:13:04] <Pookiedaexzile> 3d anime fighter is breaking my mind
[1:13:07] <TehMud> I've never seen this game. Did watch the anime tho
[1:13:09] <ashbirds> bazett's "noble phantasm" is an ancient sword that activates when the enemy uses their strongest move and counters it
[1:13:11] <Clundy> The 4:3 ratio raw footage is surprisingly crisp
[1:13:12] <giogio346> rider doujins SeemsGood
[1:13:14] <SableS139a> YOOOOOOO
[1:13:15] <KogaNoidZX> Bazett confirmed for FF7R, she's in the Turks
[1:13:17] <jorniev> wait
[1:13:18] <DSD24> Rider's great
[1:13:20] <+alphonseisbest> @BreakersAweigh idk its been quite chill since the game started
[1:13:20] <jorniev> she is
[1:13:20] <BreakersAweigh> i'm a fate fan and goddamnit its impossible to explain to people without sounding ridiculous
[1:13:21] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[1:13:23] <+TopTieramisu> the comeback?
[1:13:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> PogChamp
[1:13:25] <TheSaltminer> BELLEROPHON
[1:13:26] <SnakeVash> I'm surprised we actually saw it
[1:13:27] <MaxXtreme23> @cascadepersona at least Shiki's in melty
[1:13:28] <phatmac16> Yeyeye
[1:13:29] <@Solidus_113> CLOSE
[1:13:29] <+TopTieramisu> nvm
[1:13:30] <hassanico2> This game aged really well visually
[1:13:32] <DarkestDom> PogChamp PogChamp
[1:13:33] <%Th3SmartAlec> OHHHHHH
[1:13:34] <DSD24> @BreakersAweigh THat's why I don't bother
[1:13:34] <garbageheaphound> CLOSE
[1:13:42] <jphuty> imagine Bazett in FGO as grace o'malley
[1:13:46] <Pookiedaexzile> A game with stylized graphics aging well?
[1:13:46] <am_omega> Reggie, Rider's divekick is actually really useful and can combo
[1:13:47] <BreakersAweigh> @alphonseisbest i'm glad. I missed the whole shitshow last time people tried explaining fate to the boys
[1:13:50] <Fear_Ranjer> Honestly as a non-Fate fan I'm seeing the stuff about class systems and stuff and it sounds bloody awesome
[1:13:50] <SeruraRenge> Bazett doesn't have a NP because she's not a servant. I think she borrowed that dagger
[1:13:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @breakersaweigh Just like Kingdom Hearts and Metal Gear LUL
[1:13:51] <VritraReiRei> @keogamer the rock-paper-scissors thing that FGO has is not real lore
[1:13:52] <Pookiedaexzile> Who would have guessed
[1:13:57] <phatmac16> Bazett should’ve been in LB2
[1:14:01] <brunoberserk> rider super is broken as fuck , is otg and you can do 3 i an row
[1:14:04] <+cascadepersona> @maxxtreme23 That she is, but further inclusion in more media is always welcome.
[1:14:06] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @BreakersAweigh
[1:14:07] <%FuqBoiSlim> Okay why tf is she called Jalter? I mean the grey bitch
[1:14:09] <haisho> Fragrarach is one of the few NPs that can be used by the living so yes she has one
[1:14:09] <keogamer> hope to be present if Woolie does a "Get into fighting games" Phantom breaker Edition.
[1:14:14] <%RyuuAoi> Alright! Reggie gettin hot!
[1:14:15] <garbageheaphound> We told you this game was hype
[1:14:16] <laserbeaming> HOW IS THAT SAFE?
[1:14:18] <+cascadepersona> @fuqboislim Jeanne Alter
[1:14:19] <Brutalyte616> Bazett seems to have strong priority.
[1:14:19] <+alphonseisbest> @BreakersAweigh its was just as bad before the game started but its chilled out LUL
[1:14:23] <+DarthRevan0609> Jalter=Jeanne Alter aka Evil Joan of Arc
[1:14:30] <TheSaltminer> @FuqBoiSlim short for "Jeanne D'Arc Alter"
[1:14:30] <KogaNoidZX> Wait Bazett can cancel into stance and make it safe, what
[1:14:32] <DSD24> @FuqBoiSlim Ok her real name is Jeanne ALter so shorthand is just Jalter
[1:14:33] <+Lionhart16> @fuqboislim Jeanne d'Arc alter
[1:14:37] <%FuqBoiSlim> But who's Jeann?
[1:14:42] <BreakersAweigh> @alphonseisbest good thing i showed up right when the game started
[1:14:45] <+cascadepersona> @fuqboislim Joan of Arc
[1:14:45] <+DarthRevan0609> Jeanne is Joan of Arc
[1:14:46] <DSD24> @FuqBoiSlim Jeanne D'Arc
[1:14:46] <Pookiedaexzile> Screen controll orbs in a 3d fighter LUL
[1:14:52] <Fear_Ranjer> oh okay that naming convention sucks
[1:14:54] <hassanico2> So Rider is actually high tier in this right?
[1:14:54] <YaminoRaiden> It sets up another Super I think
[1:14:58] <SeruraRenge> the easiest way to remember is that if you call her Jannu, that's referring to normal Jeanne
[1:14:58] <SnakeVash> Jeanne D'Arc
[1:15:01] <+DarthRevan0609> Jeanne D'arc is her name in French
[1:15:04] <am_omega> She is a version of Jeanne D'Arc who had tons of rage as she was burned at the stake.
[1:15:08] <VritraReiRei> @FuqBoiSlim That lady's full name is Jeanne Alter, i.e. an alternate version of Jeanne D'Arc. So it's just fan nickname
[1:15:08] <%FuqBoiSlim> alright I understand a little more
[1:15:08] <mecha_soul> somebody taught the boys about canceling yet
[1:15:10] <rosabellamelantha> In Japan her name is just Jeanne Dark so
[1:15:10] <laserbeaming> Was that teleport overhead safe? Or was woolie just too slow in the punishment?
[1:15:11] <TheSaltminer> we need to see some Level 3s already
[1:15:14] <MaxXtreme23> I think from my memory the best character in the game was either Diarmuid or Saber Alter
[1:15:15] <rosabellamelantha> or Jeanne Horta
[1:15:22] <rosabellamelantha> I prefer alter
[1:15:23] <maskedmook> I hope they make another Fate fighting game or rerelease this one
[1:15:25] <%Th3SmartAlec> @fear_ranjer Saber Alter doesn't even make sense with the naming convention LUL
[1:15:26] <%JohnAtDawn> HEY GUYS I THINK HE KNOWS WHAT THE NAME IS NOW
[1:15:26] <+TopTieramisu> ROFL
[1:15:27] <+DarthRevan0609> Who's gonna play my boy Archer Emiya?
[1:15:28] <kaminarihime3> sacrifice your health for more coom mana
[1:15:29] <BreakersAweigh> BELLEROPHON
[1:15:29] <Sol_Install> LUL
[1:15:30] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LUL
[1:15:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Jeanne Darc Alter the tsuniest tsundere who ever tsunned, But she still wonderful
[1:15:31] <%RyuuAoi> AYYYE
[1:15:33] <SableS139a> DO IT AGAIN
[1:15:33] <Dstar1989> @woolieversus what u know about fate bro
[1:15:33] <mr_red117> LUL
[1:15:34] <+alphonseisbest> Man I forgot how HYPE this is!!!
[1:15:35] <@Solidus_113> They never expect 2 supers in a row
[1:15:35] <DSD24> Rider's great!
[1:15:36] <SeruraRenge> @am_omega No she's an OC Donut Steel fanfic by Gilles who THOUGHT that Jeanne would have that mindset when in reality she died with no regrets
[1:15:38] <+cascadepersona> LUL
[1:15:39] <Vermillion129> @JohnAtDawn Are you sure?
[1:15:42] <%RyuuAoi> REGGIE TAK THAT V
[1:15:43] <am_omega> Yeah she is
[1:15:47] <jubejube56> Okay but just in case maybe google the entire life history of Joan of Arc
[1:15:49] <jubejube56> just in case
[1:15:50] <sendart> Jeanne d'Arc Alter Santa Lily
[1:15:51] <am_omega> But what its based off is that.
[1:15:52] <alephalpha> no command lsit?
[1:15:53] <%LordSDB> The ball is still there
[1:15:54] <%FuqBoiSlim> I didn't except the chat to explode like that woolieKICKDAD woolieKICKDAD woolieKICKDAD
[1:16:02] <+Tamarrow> give me that unlimited blade works
[1:16:04] <am_omega> Its pretty much Gilles OC waifu tho.
[1:16:18] <DSD24> @FuqBoiSlim People do like answering questions especially in media they like
[1:16:18] <kaminarihime3> then theres her in a swimsuit with three katanas
[1:16:25] <DSD24> Summer Jalter!
[1:16:30] <+DarthRevan0609> Summer Jalter is a Vergil fan
[1:16:32] <hassanico2> YOu mean jerker Kappa
[1:16:35] <SeruraRenge> and when she died again, it got most of her rage out of her and she stopped being so upset so now she's just tsundere
[1:16:36] <rosabellamelantha> Reminder that this is the series in which abigail williams is the priestess for fucking YOG SOTHOTH
[1:16:36] <%alcors_wisdom> FATE LORE: a character can have multiple forms based on the various interpretations of that person and their story i.e. medusa has 5 different forms
[1:16:41] <laserbeaming> is it back forward is it a charge?
[1:16:41] <Aussie_Manny> But... we HAVE a Vergil in FGO...
[1:16:42] <+alphonseisbest> anyone else getting SMT vie form the music?
[1:16:43] <jphuty> summer jalter watched way too much yu yu hakusho
[1:16:44] <rosabellamelantha> I love fate it's dumb and good
[1:16:47] <%Th3SmartAlec> Jalter and her Vergil figurines...
[1:16:48] <DSD24> @DarthRevan0609 and a Hiei fan from Yu Yu Hakusho
[1:16:49] <%Pigg1yJuffs> You underestimate the power of us Fate fans who actually know what we're talking about and can discuss it without being cringey. @fuqboislim
[1:16:52] <Aussie_Manny> Jeanzerker.
[1:16:53] <Monkeyweed21> KI rules
[1:16:53] <shadowmaksim> Setting down two orbs is required for her Grail Super. Otherwise, the orbs enhance her regular super where she shoots an orb.
[1:16:57] <jphuty> she has a spirit gun and dragon of the darkness flame
[1:16:57] <+DarthRevan0609> yeah we just got Hajime

[1:17:31] <+SirTrae> Berserker is the strongest there is
[1:17:34] <%alcors_wisdom> @Pigg1yJuffs all fate lore is bad none of it is good trust me ive read/watched/and played it all to know for sure
[1:17:35] <Fear_Ranjer> Oh god the fuck is- Berserker is HERACLES!?
[1:17:38] <ハクア> lmao gilgamesh straight up starts with EA
[1:17:40] <laserbeaming> That Gilgamesh doesn't look like a Sumerian King at all.
[1:17:42] <haisho> BETTER NOT LOSE WOOLIE
[1:17:43] <DSD24> I love Assasssin in this
[1:17:43] <TheSaltminer> BIG HERC
[1:17:43] <am_omega> Yes
[1:17:45] <jubejube56> LOL ain't nothing canon about gil pulling out ea like that
[1:17:48] <SableS139a> @Fear_Ranjer Yessir
[1:17:48] <kaminarihime3> I miss mud femboi
[1:17:49] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> AW YEA GILGAMESH
[1:17:49] <+Tamarrow> fight is a interesting word for what happened
[1:17:51] <am_omega> And Herc is some bullshit.
[1:17:52] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> He's so cool looking
[1:17:53] <brunoberserk> gilgamesh can change stances
[1:17:54] <BreakersAweigh> SAVE ILLYA, WOOLIE
[1:17:58] <hassanico2> Oh man Gilgamesh's VA is so much more restrained in this LUL
[1:17:58] <Pookiedaexzile> Zodd usta be a redbone now he darkskinned
[1:18:00] <+cascadepersona> Berserker has Gamma wave, hell yeah
[1:18:01] <Fear_Ranjer> @SableS139a Raaaaaaad
[1:18:03] <rosabellamelantha> Herc can be summoned as a Zerk or an archer
[1:18:03] <DSD24> @BreakersAweigh Nope let her die
[1:18:09] <hassanico2> It's actually kinda weird how much less bombastic GIl sounds
[1:18:10] <dmtjinni> HUGE PogChamp
[1:18:10] <am_omega> He has multiple lives based on his deeds.
[1:18:11] <rosabellamelantha> archer herc is more reasonable
[1:18:18] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @laserbeaming there's a version of him, his caster form, which at least has period accurate clothes
[1:18:18] <sendart> ah yeah arts attack spam
[1:18:21] <%BallerSwagBro9k> CASUAL EA LUL
[1:18:23] <%Pigg1yJuffs> @alcors_wisdom Pick and choose, my friend. Pick and choose. It's all good if you just choose to ignore the bad.
[1:18:26] <%0rond> remember how gilgamesh thinks it's disrepectful to use ea as a normal sword
[1:18:26] <haisho> Herc can be summoned as any regular class that isn't Caster really

[1:19:14] <Vermillion129> @DarthRevan0609 yes, he's in a novel written by the same guy who did Baccano and Durarara
[1:19:14] <+Lionhart16> @darthrevan0609 and then is forced to be an avenger
[1:19:16] <rosabellamelantha> this is about how the fight wenty

[1:19:18] <WholesomeSandwhichPeddler> Living up to that Archer class
[1:19:19] <UltimateSSJZeroX> Shoutouts to Tomokazu Seki for his performance as Gil. Who also voiced Domon Kasshu & Kanji Tatsumi.
[1:19:20] <rosabellamelantha> like
[1:19:20] <NeonBleu> You shall not pass

[1:19:23] <KogaNoidZX> You can probably just sidestep it lmao
[1:19:25] <SnakeVash> Chains of Enkidu
[1:19:25] <+StrifeZubia> Ea and Enkidu, Gil's only two weapons. Seems legit.
[1:19:26] <FastmanJones> This is too canon
[1:19:27] <rosabellamelantha> this is basically that fight
[1:19:28] <%BallerSwagBro9k> DEFINITELY BALANCED AND FAIR
[1:19:29] <DSD24> There's the Mongrel
[1:19:29] <+PR0swagonist> FOOTSIES
[1:19:30] <%0rond> holy shit did whoever designed it ever see gilgamesh fight? not using gate of babylon almost at all, but swining ea wildly like a normal sword?
[1:19:30] <SeruraRenge> see THIS is canon gil
[1:19:34] <haisho> could be a matchup think making the chains track Berserker
[1:19:37] <BreakersAweigh> gil spamming chains against zerker is pretty canon actually
[1:19:40] <UltimateSSJZeroX> Fear thy mongrel
[1:19:41] <ThatButler> Reggie got grail!

[1:19:44] <ハクア> this is about as canon as it gets
[1:19:45] <gordieda20> Gil has 2 stances
[1:19:48] <+TopTieramisu> enkidu is a berserker hard counter
[1:19:48] <+LandOfTheWay> exactly as fair as canon
[1:19:48] <+Peregrin38> Gilgamesh has a GoB mode, but it's a transformation command (I think down-down?)
[1:19:48] <alephalpha> not gates of abblyon gilgamesh looks so funny
[1:19:48] <rosabellamelantha> LAMEST EA

[1:23:03] <KogaNoidZX> Five bucks says Woolie finds the projectile invul move
[1:23:03] <VritraReiRei> One of the few things I remember from this game is that Berserker can get 11 hits of SUPER ARMOR if he gets the Holy Grail?

[1:39:05] <devanmuse> @jetjagger222 Eeeh, sorry. Got a little too crazy with lore talk I only just barely understand myself
[1:39:08] <%alcors_wisdom> FATE LORE: archer is the main character, shirou, after the grail war he goes to the middle east to fight as a mercenary and dies failing to save some children which is how he ascends to the throne of heros

[1:47:08] <sosuke5> Is it, Woolie?
[1:47:09] <+DarthRevan0609> Saber is King Arthur
[1:47:09] <DSD24> @Menitta Nah this is Arthur
[1:47:11] <YakumoYomi> Not wind
[1:47:12] <SeruraRenge> @WoolieVersus The funny thing is he actually used to be much better at pronouncing it but got worse over the years
[1:47:14] <Leafboi125> Jigg
[1:47:14] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @menitta King Arthur
[1:47:15] <haisho> look that's how Fate is. Sabers shoot beams out of their swords, Archers never use bows and Lancers keep getting bad luck
[1:47:15] <SableS139a> To be fair, Archer's seiyu's improved his English big time. UBW sounds even better in the upcoming Fate/Extra remake
[1:47:16] <%jetjagger222> @Menitta sup bluebeard
[1:47:16] <damienlunas> Who says it's a sword? It could be a spear, or even an axe. Kappa
[1:47:16] <alephalpha> hollow ataraxia sakura ahs some stuff not enoughf ro amoveste thoguh
[1:47:17] <TheSaltminer> *Monty Python memes intensify*
[1:47:17] <sagemodeanon> The Ingrish just makes it cooler
[1:47:17] <0cash> BB Summer grailers where you at <3
[1:47:20] <%Th3SmartAlec> ...Chat, does Saber say the thing if she Supers?
[1:47:21] <jorniev> SHE IS KING ARTHUR
[1:47:21] <Teras_ode> 🤔 maybe it's an axe
[1:47:21] <+LandOfTheWay> i feel like the phrase "memes aside this is actually cool" describes the entire fate franchise
[1:47:21] <rosemon5001> saber and a just a spoiler fight
[1:47:22] <brunoberserk> the broken english is part of the chant , dont work if you speak good english LUL
[1:47:22] <phatmac16> THE wind hides the sword
[1:47:22] <Aussie_Manny> It's a shame Fate fans have already tainted our boys so they never get into Fate.
[1:47:23] <OkamiDude15> @Menitta naw thats another peson who just looks similar
[1:47:23] <%RyuuAoi> Aight Reggie you def got some shit!
[1:47:23] <@Menitta> NotLikeThis
[1:47:24] <rosabellamelantha> Saber impregnated her SISTER with a dick
[1:47:28] <jorniev> SHE IS A DAD
[1:47:28] <+Peregrin38> It's me I'm here I have grailed all of my BBs
[1:47:28] <0rond> @alcors_wisdom not quite right
[1:47:32] <prime_name> Is this Futa Saber?
[1:47:33] <Thunderhog> I really hope they land the sakura super
[1:47:33] <shadowmaksim> We are going to see Sakura's super, aren't we? That's going to be hard to explain.
[1:47:35] <%wibbwobbler> looks like saber
[1:47:36] <spardanwarrior> Can't just go around advertising that you're carrying around EXCALIBUR

[1:47:48] <Teras_ode> Moedred is better Kappa
[1:47:49] <+PlushMines> LUL
[1:47:51] <+kinganfortas> two king arthurs??? now that's just crazy
[1:47:51] <%Pigg1yJuffs> It was supposed to be the whole thing of how most mages are english speaking europeans, but when more of those types of people were introduced, the more hilarious the engrish became.
[1:47:52] <%LordSDB> Kappa
[1:47:52] <am_omega> Hey there is actul male King Arthur in fate as well.
[1:47:53] <ハクア> maybe a staff, or a gun, or a broom, or a water gun, or a scythe
[1:47:53] <%SilverDevilfish> No Reggie your character just has worms Kappa
[1:47:58] <%0rond> UM AKSHUALLY, her sister stole her semen from when she had a dick to create an homonculus
[1:47:58] <%jetjagger222> she cute but not as cute as jeanne
[1:47:59] <Halospaz117> @Teras_ode damn right
[1:48:01] <%th3madness> for once, woolie finds himself facing the boss character
[1:48:02] <haisho> so when does Invisible Air come off
[1:48:02] <DSD24> Here comes the worm comments!
[1:48:05] <zamzoph> Reggie needs to be caught up on the lore
[1:48:06] <hassanico2> So Sakura is the final boss right?
[1:48:08] <Aussie_Manny> Heaven's Feel.
[1:48:11] <+Vigonept> male king arthur is super cool
[1:48:12] <@Menitta> Fate has spoilers?
[1:48:13] <BreakersAweigh> its common knowledge, its cool
[1:48:14] <devanmuse> Woolie is King Arthur, and Reggie... honestly, I have no idea what the whole deal is here. Something about "Angry Matthew"
[1:48:18] <Vermillion129> We are fate people, this aint spoiler to us LUL
[1:48:19] <townzzzzz> the current fate story is beyond this
[1:48:20] <SnakeVash> Spoiler for Heaven's Feel
[1:48:22] <KetsuoTaberu> literally just seeing Sakura here is a major spoiler lmao
[1:48:23] <ashbirds> it's been 15 years lol
[1:48:23] <haisho> you can't even jump into Fate without getting spoiled about SOMETHING
[1:48:23] <%emperordread> I'd tap Queen Arthur so hard that even she couldn't pull my Excalibur out Kappa
[1:48:23] <+CookieCutter007> I remember that psycho pass movie's English
[1:48:24] <@Menitta> the wind sword is cool
[1:48:25] <%Th3SmartAlec> It's a multiverse anyway
[1:48:26] <%alcors_wisdom> fate isnt worth being worried about spoilers
[1:48:27] <Sol_Install> Sakura entire character here is a huge spoiler
[1:48:27] <SeruraRenge> spoiler from the most commonly known thing for a VN from 2004
[1:48:28] <BreakersAweigh> this is 15 years ago lol
[1:48:29] <hassanico2> @Menitta the twist of Reggie's character is literally a movie coming out this year
[1:48:30] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> How do people not know Saber is Arthur at this point?
[1:48:30] <scrumbotime> Angry Matthews Nasty Worm Time
[1:48:31] <$Jhylla81> Theres just too much Fate material for me to ever wanna get into it
[1:48:31] <sosuke5> You mean the most common knowledge thing ever?
[1:48:31] <Orenjevel> Wind Sword is actually a Wind Dick
[1:48:31] <subjectg> @devanmuse angry manicure
[1:48:35] <MaxXtreme23> Real talk, I really wish Angra was in this game
[1:48:36] <YakumoYomi> Lancer Arturia > Saber Arturia
[1:48:36] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> Fate has too much lore I don't even care about spoilers anymore lmao
[1:48:37] <kaminarihime3> hahaha
[1:48:37] <huskarl_zap> Creampie arthur
[1:48:38] <phatmac16> Sakura is a huge spoiler
[1:48:40] <%FuqBoiSlim> Worms? Does the purple hair girl have a tapeworm or something?
[1:48:41] <MaxXtreme23> Feels a little sad to only have Bazett but no Angra
[1:48:45] <+kinganfortas> the chat has been a constant nonstop deluge of spoilers for over an hour and Woolie is warning us for spoiling that King Arthur is in it
[1:48:45] <%0rond> man people who only read the wiki need to stop judging the quality of fate
[1:48:46] <%RyuuAoi> Woolie Vs. SPOILERS
[1:48:47] <DSD24> @FuqBoiSlim Don't ask
[1:48:47] <Teras_ode> to be fair just about everything fate already spoils or assumes you know who saber is
[1:48:48] <+Reioumu> Is there going to be any parsec happening with this?
[1:48:49] <TheSaltminer> Angry Manchester United
[1:48:49] <+DarthRevan0609> Penis Worms
[1:48:50] <ray9k9> Reggie’s entire character is a spoiler!
[1:48:50] <phatmac16> Angra would be cool
[1:48:51] <hassanico2> @FuqBoiSlim better off not knowing
[1:48:52] <+BigCoffee> Angra Mainyu is angry
[1:48:52] <+TopTieramisu> sakura doing her zafina impression
[1:48:53] <%th3madness> angry manjew
[1:48:54] <am_omega> Er yes lets go with tapeworms
[1:48:55] <gordieda20> Eh it dosen't really matter at this point
[1:48:56] <brunoberserk> in canon , this fight is probably a one hit ko
[1:48:57] <KetsuoTaberu> @FuqBoiSlim I wish they were just tapeworms dude
[1:48:57] <OkamiDude15> @FuqBoiSlim its complicated and pretty fucked up
[1:48:57] <Ner234> @FuqBoiSlim You don't wanna know
[1:48:59] <rosabellamelantha> @FuqBoiSlim it's complicated and awful
[1:49:03] <shadowmaksim> I think Sakura is probably the bigger spoiler at this point.
[1:49:06] <Potatoidea> @FuqBoiSlim She bit a fish or something, so I wouldn't be surprised
[1:49:07] <StarlitStunner> Ahriman
[1:49:12] <@Menitta> Well I watched like...8 episodes of Stay Night so like
[1:49:15] <rosemon5001> we sell curses and curse accessorys here
[1:49:16] <%0rond> @shadowmaksim there's a spoiler in shirou's moveset too
[1:49:18] <SeruraRenge> @Potatoidea I HATE IT
[1:49:19] <SnakeVash> Sakura has worms eating on her from the inside out.
[1:49:22] <hassanico2> Oh man Deen Stay Night LUL
[1:49:23] <%FuqBoiSlim> Let me quit while I'm still innocent woolieDATTEBAYO
[1:49:23] <GypsyMagi> Remember when you save Sakura in the FGO Zero event and they dont even give her a character portrait sprite
[1:49:25] <+TopTieramisu> kaze no kizu
[1:49:25] <@Menitta> I think I know enough to say this is dumb lol
[1:49:25] <alephalpha> sakura like this in in the alstr oute the kinga rthur reveal is int he mdidle of the first
[1:49:28] <Orenjevel> WIND!
[1:49:29] <%GalacticaPhanto> Nasu really likes sexual assault doesnt he? god
[1:49:30] <sagemodeanon> tapeworms would be a lot better than what she has going on
[1:49:34] <%Pigg1yJuffs> The simple act of getting into Fate is spoilers. You cannot dodge them in this series. Either because of the age of the series or the other Fate media spoiling each other.
[1:49:34] <Potatoidea> @SeruraRenge LUL
[1:49:34] <DSD24> @GypsyMagi Hey man budget
[1:49:37] <TheSaltminer> Here, have some imaginary numbers
[1:49:38] <+ghostfaceninja_> I noticed Astolfo isn't in this, did he come later?
[1:49:39] <huskarl_zap> Nero is best king arthur
[1:49:40] <DrBeanie> See if you can get marlinpie
[1:49:41] <%jetjagger222> @GalacticaPhanto not as much as molluscs
[1:49:44] <Sol_Install> @Menitta Ah so the Authur route ok
[1:49:47] <am_omega> Astolfo came out later.
[1:49:48] <%0rond> @ghostfaceninja_ way, way later
[1:49:49] <OkamiDude15> @GypsyMagi the money for those sprites went towards the movie so its fine Kappa
[1:49:49] <+Vigonept> start fate with fgo
[1:49:49] <DSD24> @ghostfaceninja_ Much later
[1:49:50] <am_omega> Much later.
[1:49:51] <hassanico2> @Ghostbody like over a decade later
[1:49:51] <%RyuuAoi> Saber looks beast. Sakura...I still need ta see dat shine, girl.
[1:49:52] <Halospaz117> Astolfo was introduced in Apocrypha, right?
[1:49:52] <Ner234> @ghostfaceninja_ Way later
[1:49:54] <+LandOfTheWay> @Menitta that's 7 more episodes than i managed before i got told how bad that adaptation was
[1:49:54] <GothicLolitaAngel> Much later @ghostfaceninja_
[1:49:54] <Chimeraelite> oh wait shit is she "that girl?" The one in the pit?
[1:49:57] <SeruraRenge> @GalacticaPhanto It's why people thought for years that nasu is secretly a girl because rape is really, really common in shoujo manga
[1:49:59] <DSD24> @Halospaz117 Yes he was
[1:49:59] <huskarl_zap> Thanksgiving is over spam padarou
[1:50:02] <SableS139a> @FuqBoiSlim Crest Worms were put into Sakura's body as a kid that actively feed off of her lust and magic. This shit plus a number of other horrific experiences set up by Zouken turn Sakura into who she is now.
[1:50:03] <%alcors_wisdom> @Chimeraelite yes
[1:50:03] <%jetjagger222> @Chimeraelite ding ding ding
[1:50:05] <VritraReiRei> I hope Reggie pulls off Sakura's Super. It's AMAZING
[1:50:05] <OkamiDude15> @Chimeraelite yup
[1:50:08] <am_omega> yes she is the girl in the pit.
[1:50:09] <+kinganfortas> "Wind...!"
[1:50:10] <Orenjevel> wind isnt even that strong
[1:50:10] <huskarl_zap> PADORU PADAROUUUUUUU
[1:50:11] <am_omega> Yes its bad
[1:50:18] <%Th3SmartAlec> Can we agree the Hollow Atraxia design for Sakura is fucking sick?
[1:50:18] <%alphonseisbest> @GalacticaPhanto OLD nasu yea, hes really come a long way from that, we haven't had a singe rape in fgo and extra so thats like 10 years without rape
[1:50:22] <@Menitta> the wind sword is cool
[1:50:22] <GypsyMagi> Man I cannot unhear BB
[1:50:23] <Chimeraelite> Well damn, I've only watched like 2 episodes
[1:50:24] <MKII> spoilers for the movie that still has a part 3 coming specifically
[1:50:28] <%alcors_wisdom> @SableS139a "put into" is a rather mild way of puting it
[1:50:30] <Chimeraelite> coolio
[1:50:30] <@Menitta> like thats actually cool
[1:50:34] <%FuqBoiSlim> @sables139a damn thats crazy
[1:50:35] <%GalacticaPhanto> That's good, because this was the reason why I dropped Fate
[1:50:36] <Teras_ode> need different knight of the round table for solarpower reggie Kappa
[1:50:36] <%jetjagger222> also her brother is the worst character in the series
[1:50:42] <DSD24> BB would be a good fighting game character
[1:50:43] <TheSaltminer> "Have some imaginary numbers, I'ma kill you with ALGEBRA"
[1:50:45] <%th3madness> man, this is such a surprisingly competent fighting gmae
[1:50:49] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Wind Sword is a way of concealing her identity, since names are power in Fate. If someone saw her sword it’d be like “I KNOW WHO YOU ARE”
[1:50:53] <Halospaz117> @jetjagger222 Obligatory fuck shinji
[1:50:55] <rosemon5001> @huskarl_zap the ice demands you wait a few more days to spread her word
[1:51:04] <StarlitStunner> Shinji is a good seaweed boy
[1:51:04] <damienlunas> @alphonseisbest is there a calendar on the wall stating "It has been ___ days since Nasu was creepy"
[1:51:07] <+Peregrin38> fuck shinji
[1:51:10] <hassanico2> Sakura reminds me of some other game character and I'm not sure who?
[1:51:10] <@Menitta> names are power???
[1:51:16] <hassanico2> Like, her moveset I mean
[1:51:16] <huskarl_zap> @rosemon5001 But fate is happening NOW
[1:51:18] <SableS139a> @alcors_wisdom @FuqBoiSlim Yeah, I'm being super fucking light here. Shit's even worse than I could ever reasonable put it.
[1:51:21] <+Reioumu> This game has a lot of really busted shit.
[1:51:22] <Nekros4442> yes names are literally power
[1:51:24] <Sol_Install> Names are power in this yea
[1:51:25] <%alcors_wisdom> @damienlunas that number is 0 since he keeps making lolis
[1:51:26] <am_omega> Well since they are famous heroes you can find out their weakness.
[1:51:27] <haisho> more like names are a Z-targetable weakness
[1:51:27] <Udongein_1> knowing their names can reveal their weaknesses
[1:51:29] <+PenGia> Yeah because knowing someone's True Name means you know their history and lore and what killed them in life
[1:51:34] <%alphonseisbest> @damienlunas no but there should be for all JP writers, they like it alot LUL
[1:51:36] <+Reioumu> You can unscale damage on supers if you put a projectile on the screen before hand
[1:51:38] <gordieda20> Yea Like the obvious Achilles
[1:51:38] <Sol_Install> knowing the name of a servant legit makes you know how to fight them
[1:51:39] <+DarthRevan0609> Its more like "If you know someone's name, you know their legend." So if you know you're fighting say Achilles, you know to hit his heel
[1:51:40] <Udongein_1> if you knew who achilles was youd know how to beat him
[1:51:41] <+PenGia> And thus also have an idea of their abilities
[1:51:42] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Menitta knowing who someone is is also knowing their weakness
[1:51:43] <BreakersAweigh> @Menitta kind of? it just gives you an edge over knowing weaknesses
[1:51:45] <%alcors_wisdom> @SableS139a ikr man fate is awful
[1:51:49] <DSD24> Obligatory Fuck Achilles
[1:51:50] <SableS139a> @Menitta For the Servants & Heroic Spirits at least. Find out their real names & you have a sure-fire guide to their weaknesses.
[1:51:52] <rosabellamelantha> @alcors_wisdom nasu isn't the sole person who designs the characters you know
[1:51:52] <@Menitta> I guess that makes sense
[1:51:53] <alephalpha> which can amke thinsg verye asy in certain cases like you cna ebat cu by offeirng him dog meat
[1:51:54] <Vashido22> if you know you're fighting jeanne of arc, what would you use?
[1:51:55] <hassanico2> Chat how does Woolie do a full super here
[1:51:56] <%Pigg1yJuffs> @menitta Less the name and more the knowledge about said name. How fucked would it be if someone walked up and knew you were Achilles?
[1:51:56] <%RyuuAoi> Play the range game, Reggie! Teleport out. She got potential!
[1:51:57] <Vashido22> shit like that
[1:52:00] <GypsyMagi> Fate is terrible, but also Fate is great
[1:52:00] <TheAdMerlin> If you knew you were fighting Achilles, you'd aim for the ankles. THsu names are power. Though Achilles is a super bad ass who can run at super sonic speeds in fate
[1:52:01] <Teras_ode> like if you knew a greek dudes name is achilles, you'd immediatelly know where to shoot
[1:52:02] <haisho> kinda one of the things people like about Fate: it isn't always about big number
[1:52:03] <hassanico2> Or can she not actually EXCALIBAAAH
[1:52:05] <%jetjagger222> its both fucking awful and the hypest shit
[1:52:09] <Sol_Install> OH THE GRAB
[1:52:11] <%jetjagger222> a lot like comics
[1:52:13] <+Reioumu> that's the NSFW super
[1:52:14] <shadowmaksim> Oh no, so close. Don't do it.
[1:52:15] <Vashido22> Fate sucks and is the sickest shit
[1:52:17] <shadowmaksim> No.
[1:52:18] <+Reioumu> Demonitized
[1:52:18] <%alcors_wisdom> @rosabellamelantha oh im aware but you think he doesnt sign off on every one that get gets made?
[1:52:21] <%FuqBoiSlim> So like he Abraham Lincoln was a summon you just make sure to fight him in a movie theater right?
[1:52:21] <Chimeraelite> oh lordy

[1:55:05] <ray9k9> He’s actually inferior.
[1:55:06] <GypsyMagi> O MY WOBBLY PUNCHES
[1:55:11] <%alcors_wisdom> FATE LORE: "zero lancer" isnt the same lancer as the other lancer, hes an entirely different person from the "fate zero" series which comes before the "fate stay/night" series

[1:55:21] <jphuty> let's go kojirooooo
[1:55:21] <hassanico2> So how many years before Zero did this actually come out?
[1:55:21] <%0rond> @hassanico2 they basically tied, musashi only won because we were watching
[1:55:24] <Fear_Ranjer> Wait is this meant to be Riastrad Cu Chulainn??
[1:55:25] <manwithaxe> JOBBER VS JOBBER
[1:55:32] <+ghostfaceninja_> if he's Kojiro, he should have a long flowing scarf
[1:55:33] <%jetjagger222> @manwithaxe too accurate
[1:55:37] <alephalpha> the sword swing singularity was so absurd
[1:55:38] <+Reioumu> Zero lancer has a good divekick
[1:55:38] <%th3madness> beware the second swallow
[1:55:39] <+StrifeZubia> @MyNameIsRasus That was Cu, this is Diarmuid
[1:55:41] <hassanico2> @0rond in FGO 1.5 sure, but as far as proper human history...

[1:56:16] <bigmantalope> how do we play sets, who's on?
[1:56:16] <Thunderhog> @WoolieVersus Assasin is Kojiro, so literally mr. Tsubame himself
[1:56:16] <+Vigonept> Cut that bird
[1:56:16] <+TopTieramisu> dude. ukyo is ripping off kojiro. not the other way around
[1:56:19] <%jetjagger222> based off the same guy
[1:56:20] <phatmac16> KOJIRO
[1:56:22] <+blueflame910> blueflame910 subscribed with Prime. 
[1:56:24] <Ner234> Lancers are just big swallows
[1:56:26] <SeruraRenge> they got the voice actor of Kojiro from Pokemon to voice Kojiro but they didn't get Musashi to voice Musashi. RUINED
[1:56:28] <hassanico2> Lancers are just another kind of swallow!
[1:56:30] <DSD24> @SableS139a I mean she likes cute things dood

[1:56:31] <+Vigonept> Kojiro the savior of france!
[1:56:31] <am_omega> @SpeedFetishist No. That one is a alternate universe who dimension hops
[1:56:33] <OkamiDude15> @SpeedFetishist she's from an alternate reality i think
[1:56:38] <WholesomeSandwhichPeddler> The FGO Musashi is from a different dimension where Musashi is a girl
[1:56:38] <shadowmaksim> Kojiro has no magical powers. He's breaking reality through pure skill.
[1:56:42] <manwithaxe> lancer should've picked up a boat oar
[1:56:46] <%0rond> @hassanico2 we don't know much about proper human history musashi, but given how absurdly strong drifter musashi's power is, I think we would have known if our musashi was at that power level
[1:56:46] <phatmac16> HE BROKE REALITY
[1:56:53] <GypsyMagi> someone bring in Musashi
[1:56:54] <am_omega> In actual history in the series Musashi is a dude.
[1:56:54] <%AlteisenReiseZ> If you have a sengoku era samurai in a fighting game, they HAVE to have Tsubame Gaeshi
[1:56:54] <haisho> he just wanted to cut that bird up real bad
[1:57:00] <hassanico2> Oh my god he drops the spear to use it with his feet LUL

[1:58:14] <hassanico2> Imagine being called "Fin Mc Cool" and being so lame
[1:58:17] <Vashido22> Man, Fate is the worst but also the best
[1:58:21] <%Th3SmartAlec> OHHHH
[1:58:22] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @MyNameIsRasus that's two doors down sir, right this way
[1:58:24] <huskarl_zap> Arthur was cucked by lancelot
[1:58:28] <phatmac16> ITS THE WORST/BEST
[1:58:28] <Aussie_Manny> CLUTCH
[1:58:28] <%ChoculaUltra> Diarmud must've been the inspiration of 80% of Fate doujin protags
[1:58:29] <hassanico2> oof

[1:58:41] <%0rond> @ChoculaUltra if only
[1:58:41] <SableS139a> @MyNameIsRasus That'd be OG Fate/Stay Night. The horny was barely focused on until Extra, Prima Illya, & F/GO came into play. Then it came back with a vengeance.
[1:58:44] <DSD24> I love Assassin in this game
[1:58:44] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> regend does it again
[1:58:51] <phatmac16> KOJJRO WINS
[1:58:55] <hassanico2> btw so why do all Celtic men wear bodysuits?
[1:59:00] <%ChoculaUltra> CLASH
[1:59:00] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> Love some clangs
[1:59:02] <Aussie_Manny> OH The clash cancelled it!
[1:59:04] <%0rond> @SableS139a I don't think OG extra was hornier than OG stay night
[1:59:07] <%jetjagger222> @hassanico2 its a stylized portrayal of bodypaint
[1:59:07] <GypsyMagi> @hassanico2 they represent bodypaint
[1:59:12] <+Vigonept> cause body suits are rad
[1:59:13] <alephalpha> it's refernecve ot how celtic wariiors went into abttle naked with blue body paint
[1:59:13] <ashbirds> @hassanico2 it's inspired by IRL celts using bodypaint
[1:59:13] <manwithaxe> quick, diarmuid, get the boat oar
[1:59:14] <lem______> og fsn was pretty horny
[1:59:15] <hassanico2> ooooh that makes a lot of sense
[1:59:15] <%0rond> it's really CCC that dialed up the horniness
[1:59:17] <%MyNameIsRasus> Thanks chat
[1:59:17] <%alcors_wisdom> if reggie doesnt win a single match with assassin then its a cannon match
[1:59:20] <lem______> esp heavens feel
[1:59:21] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @hassanico2 it's celtic tradition to like spandex
[1:59:26] <%MyNameIsRasus> Btw this game is sick as fuck
[1:59:26] <hassanico2> LUL
[1:59:28] <+TopTieramisu> i'm digging lancer's playstyle

[1:59:30] <Vashido22> poor assassin
[1:59:32] <huskarl_zap> @hassanico2 cuz iteland was most advanced civilization untill whisky was made.
[1:59:32] <%alcors_wisdom> @lem______ all of fate is horny
[1:59:32] <shadowmaksim> For anyone not in the know, TK'ing is a full mechanic in this game that allows for crazy stuff.
[1:59:33] <SableS139a> @0rond I keep forgetting that CCC exists sometimes and I hate myself for it.
[1:59:35] <Teras_ode> ccc was the horny one, not outright porn tho
[1:59:35] <ManlyMcBeefington> @hassanico2 how else can they for Salmon row jumps in heavy armor
[1:59:37] <@Solidus_113> What year did the first "fate" thing come out?
[1:59:40] <+TopTieramisu> i mean assassin's*

[2:00:12] <SableS139a> @0rond Hell, I'm holding out that we get CCC as an extra campaign for the Fate Extra remake, but I don't think it's happening.
[2:00:12] <Teras_ode> ccc has gil with actual character tho so eh
[2:00:13] <DrBeanie> thanks chiken
[2:00:14] <hassanico2> @0rond Padoru wasn't even from the game itself

[2:00:41] <SableS139a> @0rond As for Extra CCC, the game hasn't scored an official English translation or release as far as I know.
[2:00:44] <shadowmaksim> Fun fact, that super is unblockable at throw range.

[2:13:57] <%ChoculaUltra> chat is Xiang Yu worth the pull if I already haven't leveled up Skadiddly
[2:13:58] <hassanico2> @WoolieVersus 2 balls out for a super
[2:14:01] <peanutdot007> Your ball is a super counter thing
[2:14:03] <Hideow> Oh she is the boxer of the game,cool

[2:14:07] <+teddybomber> you should see the part where she beats up a bunch of little girls
[2:14:12] <%0rond> WAIT WHAT SHE CAN USE THE BALL?
[2:14:13] <DSD24> @ChoculaUltra You should level up Skadi first
[2:14:13] <GypsyMagi> Reminder that Fuyuki has remained in flames for the entirety of the FGO plot
[2:14:15] <TheSaltminer> when other person uses their super, Fragglerock will activate
[2:14:17] <phatmac16> the ball counters supers

[2:14:53] <SeruraRenge> @OroOreo Actually its power is dependent on the move it's countering. If it's a weak move then it'll barely do anything
[2:14:57] <+StrifeZubia> @SjoeB89 Fragarach but yes
[2:14:57] <%0rond> @LandOfTheWay that's fair
[2:14:59] <phatmac16> The name is fagraoch

[2:15:03] <%MyNameIsRasus> put two balls out hehe
[2:15:04] <shadowmaksim> The orbs have two uses. The first is that it rebounds her regular super towards the opponent if it misses for extra damage. The other is that you need two to for her grail super.

[2:44:12] <phatmac16> GAE BOLG
[2:44:27] <%Creggamonsta> who ever wins gets the channel
[2:44:36] <MaxXtreme23> man it just hit me that hassan isn't in this game
[2:44:38] <%jetjagger222> have confidence
[2:44:45] <%Th3SmartAlec> Oof
[2:44:48] <DSD24> @MaxXtreme23 This is way earlier for Hassan
[2:44:49] <@akuda_bar> BibleThump
[2:44:50] <%RyuuAoi> Risky business
[2:44:54] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @MaxXtreme23 well yeah he was Zero Hassan
[2:44:55] <phatmac16> yeah cursed arm should've been in the game
[2:45:02] <DSD24> First Hassan should be in a fighting game
[2:45:03] <@Menitta> The W stands for Wario
[2:45:07] <am_omega> Nah this is off of the DEEN anime.
[2:45:10] <phatmac16> so should Kuzuki over Liz
[2:45:11] <am_omega> Which he was not in.
[2:45:13] <+someyounguy1> so when do we do the infinites
[2:45:18] <MaxXtreme23> @DSD24 I'm just sayin, if we got Dark Sakura and Bazett, we should totally have Hassan (of the Cursed Arm)
[2:45:20] <am_omega> because its a butchered Fate route.
[2:45:22] <ashbirds> DEEN anime doesn't have dark sakura
[2:45:22] <phatmac16> luvia wasn't in the DEEN anime
[2:45:32] <DSD24> @MaxXtreme23 Right! I got my Hassan's mixed up
[2:45:35] <am_omega> Dunno its weird.
[2:45:40] <huskarl_zap> We aint got Astolfo and dudes out here stanning hasan
[2:45:43] <%Th3SmartAlec> Oh, was this game supposed to be marketing the Deen anime?
[2:45:43] <DSD24> Thought he was talking about First Hassan
[2:45:48] <%RyuuAoi> Punish
[2:45:50] <am_omega> As he should be here.
[2:45:51] <@akuda_bar> @Menitta it stands for wumbo
[2:45:59] <DSD24> @huskarl_zap That's not a problem
[2:46:02] <MaxXtreme23> Gramps is amazing but this game is mostly SN, so it'd be strange to expect him lol
[2:46:03] <%ChoculaUltra> casual clothes Astolfo or I ain't with it
[2:46:05] <%Th3SmartAlec> PogChamp
[2:46:08] <Karhax> King Hassan > Astolfo
[2:46:16] <huskarl_zap> Wrong
[2:46:31] <DSD24> Ushi needs to be in a fighting game
[2:46:32] <KalmVibrations> "I can probably TK it" is practically a mantra in this game
[2:46:34] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> BOMBOS
[2:46:40] <%FuqBoiSlim> Rider Asolfo or nothing bro shofuHandrub
[2:46:47] <DSD24> Same with Penthesilea
[2:46:49] <am_omega> Yeah its odd that Cursed Arm is not in.
[2:46:53] <%RyuuAoi> Wool putting in work!
[2:46:55] <nevan_44> caenis tho
[2:46:59] <%Pigg1yJuffs> Astolfo is one of the characters that manages to pull out my bi side by quite a margin.
[2:47:00] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> LMFAO

[0:25:36] <%gatorafan> woolieKICKDAD_SG
[0:25:36] <Drusain> "BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO"
[0:25:37] <+linSP> there’s HP and FP badges if you ever struggle
[0:25:39] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> @Estuko no but what other song could it be for "that"
[0:25:39] <%SuperKirby24> woolieONEGUY I DONT KNOW WHY
[0:25:40] <@akuda_bar> at least you didn't make an awful screaming sound whenever Grubba was talking
[0:25:40] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Prevot ZING
[0:25:41] <%Taglog7> Explain why you like over-explaining.
[0:25:42] <%YakumoYomi> Low HP is actually a benefit in TTYD, if I remember correctly, because it allows you to ramp up your damage to crazy levels
[0:25:45] <Rhinoprotoss> Its only annoying when Woolie over explains when his assumptions are wrong at the start
[0:25:46] <Snakes_dk> its just a game LUL
[0:25:47] <GenericSoda> parasocial relationship alert
[0:25:49] <sonofthedeepsouth> PLAY LIKE I WANT TO PLAY
[0:25:56] <Dragonpit1234> woolie can always change later, and BP allows variation in gameplay
[0:25:56] <sonofthedeepsouth> HE DID IT HIS WAY
[0:25:57] <noe_juan_kanobe> I dunno why people are still harping on about HP. BP maxes relatively 1quick
[0:25:58] <%Solidnick18> just let people play man
[0:26:00] <%fladdykin> woolieONEGUY
[0:26:00] <skyheys> Thankfully there's nothing left in the game to micromanage
[0:26:01] <JeoDood> but BP can give hp tho
[0:26:02] <+TrevSmith222> Nobody played that way back when it came out. lol
[0:26:03] <+Estuko> @Pyr0_Fr0st no it's perfect, I've read that and also seen that video it's spectacularly heart dissolving lol
[0:26:06] <+linSP> tell that man to play the new paper mario
[0:26:07] <%krispen_wa> FROM MY POINT OF VIEW
[0:26:08] <+regis_j_rock> Are HP stans just insecure you'll beat fights they struggled with with less HP?
[0:26:09] <%jiggy_snipe> woolieONEGUY
[0:26:12] <mooneysmeats> @WoolieVersus food for thought, hp plus and fp plus badges cost as much bp as you get for a bp level up. you're basically trading a bp level up for a fp level up which makes it not worth in my eyes
[0:26:12] <%Karkatstoaster> I did it myyyyyyyy wayyyyyyyy~
[0:26:13] <$BallerSwagBro9k> THE JEDI ARE EVIL
[0:26:13] <cosmicgoatee> its why chat is helpful when it comes to missing stuff but not outright backseating
[0:26:18] <Shroomtastic64> reg 100% accurate
[0:26:18] <@Menitta> YOU ARE NOT HAVING FUN RIGHT
[0:26:20] <%chosenjuan42> Nah you do you
[0:26:21] <Esparsenior> TBH it’s Paper Mario, there isn’t a lot of ways you could even fuck up
[0:26:22] <@Solidus_113> Your fun is SUBOPTIMAL
[0:26:24] <@akuda_bar> HAVE MORE FUN BETTER
[0:26:24] <%starzo0> fun is subjective
[0:26:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> @JeoDood For the same price as a level up, there's no real reason to pick HP
[0:26:25] <%CursedNobleman> @regis_j_rock probably LUL
[0:26:28] <Zeneeba> oh, i see what's goin on. backseaters doin a REE over his choices again?

[0:26:38] <%Solidnick18> if it's not fun for you then have fun with it yourself
[0:26:40] <JetpackMcQuack> The customer is not always right
[0:26:40] <%MontresorMeal> upgrade your pickle points or riot
[0:26:43] <%chosenjuan42> Woolie wants the full MOVESET
[0:26:44] <%TheLemuroid> Why on earth would people be pushing for more HP?
[0:26:45] <%YakumoYomi> Fun is suboptimal. Get to Minh-Maxing!
[0:26:48] <%Solidnick18> yeah man
[0:26:49] <BreakersAweigh> reggie is a good guy for having this thought pattern

[0:27:37] <%MTLer> people don't have to tune in if they don't like what they see. you do you
[0:27:38] <sonofthedeepsouth> Woolie going for that control of the avatar state
[0:27:41] <%Proxzo> enjoy what you're playing
[0:27:48] <%JustYudha> Fuck em
[0:27:48] <@Solidus_113> I have 2 games for that
[0:27:50] <sonofthedeepsouth> Let go of your earthly tethers
[0:27:52] <Zeneeba> Dude, Most of us are enjoyin you takin things at your own pace and makin your own choices. I personally love you pickin this game apart because of how much fun you're havin. Keep doin that. Fuck everythin else.
[0:27:57] <%jiggy_snipe> Woolie just do it the way you want
[0:27:58] <Snakes_dk> people do it so you can experience something to the fullest without missing out i think, thats were it comes from it seems
[0:27:58] <noe_juan_kanobe> BP maxes at 99, meaning it's only 32 out 99 levels.
[0:27:59] <iamNuTTeRR> I hope you have a fantastic stream and an even better day! Mahalo 🤙🏾
[0:28:00] <+Masamune195> y people act like you cant grind offscreen if necessary
[0:28:03] <%jiggy_snipe> even if its bad
[0:28:03] <NeroInfinite> I honestly like seeing how Woolie goes through this. I would probably have done a lot of the same things Woolie's done.
[0:28:03] <%Karkatstoaster> @sonofthedeepsouth ehhh. They weren’t *evil* but they did do some morally dubious shit for sure. They continually strived to be better, but I would say they’re more Lawful Neutral than good.
[0:28:08] <%YakumoYomi> @cosmicgoatee "Keep one eye open, plumbers. Don't let Rogueport catch you sleepin'."
[0:28:10] <damienlunas> Normally I would have some sympathy for psa1guy but Woolie is literally playing the exact 100% correct way BP for life
[0:28:11] <%exnuart> YOU WANT 30HP MIN.
[0:28:12] <pookam> Play as you want, and the people who enjoy your method will follow
[0:28:13] <dizimous> The insistant min maxing can be a bit much, but I also find it kind of fascinating. I say this doing obsessive min maxing myself, so I so you keep doing you
[0:28:14] <%Proxzo> Yeah you're doing great Woolie. This is a great stream.
[0:28:15] <%Karkatstoaster> Assuming you mean like. Prequel jedi

[0:28:33] <%krispen_wa> ONE MORE DANTE REJECTED
[0:28:35] <phantomsleeves> @noobpsyboticus it's very open world...so it depends on how much of a turn off that is
[0:28:35] <ThePizzaLovingTurtle> No Dante from Devil May Cry BibleThump

[0:31:49] <%Papa_Bearman> This honestly doesn't change the fact that Nintendo's communication in 2020 has been...I'll be generous and say "lacking."
[0:31:54] <Shroomtastic64> completely agree, but to be fair, the pokemon stuff was scum
[0:31:55] <PhantomMaskJr> Nintendo fans can’t read bawkSmile
[0:31:59] <%SuperKirby24> It hurt itself in it's confusion! LUL
[0:32:00] <Nyerp> bayonetta could have been there tho

[0:33:22] <Snakes_dk> " thats it !? " i the first after every direct
[0:33:23] <mooneysmeats> its not catering to me though
[0:33:23] <%starzo0> its not something im personally hyped for, but i love it when people get hyped for things they like
[0:33:27] <%Asuterisuku> They specified it was directed at third party stuff.

[0:33:36] <Wind_Burst> im seeing no hype for the cadence of hyrule dlc
[0:33:36] <BigDaddyofCincinnati> I feel like Nintendo has babied their fanbase into only caring about their major core franchises
[0:33:37] <$Superdandy96> Still no Bayo 3 or Metroid Prime 4, dang it
[0:33:37] <GenericSoda> @somesageadvice that was actually done awhile ago but point still stands
[0:33:37] <%Proxzo> @WoolieVersus Hey Woolie, just wanted to say having a great time with Origami King. There's a lot to it, and I don't think people should dismiss it right away. It has a really weak Chapter 1 though. But then it goes off after that.
[0:33:39] <%Ancopro> Metroid sunshine of the Wild lets GOO
[0:33:40] <%CursedNobleman> @GenericSoda the fzero apparently yes, i didnt check anything about the mario

[0:34:32] <%gnoame> Origami King as Autumn mountain, game is good just from that awesome area.
[0:34:32] <+zooeymainbtw> zoomers ruin communities
[0:34:35] <HillBurN> @WoolieVersus It's still valid to think it was the worst direct even if you had tempered your expectations
[0:34:36] <%jiggy_snipe> but what if you play SG with one character?

[0:34:52] <phantomsleeves> i'm sure origami king is great, but going from ttyd straight to that is gonna hurt way too much
[0:34:53] <%Solidnick18> never heard of it

[0:35:04] <@Solidus_113> Don't actually buy Bug Fables because it's Dangen
[0:35:04] <%LuckyLagomorph> yeyeye Bug Fables!
[0:35:06] <pookam> Bug Fables is licherally acksually Paper Mario
[0:35:06] <%chosenjuan42> SUPER PAPER MARIO has a hype story
[0:35:08] <%Asuterisuku> KI is the best 6 button fighter though.
[0:35:08] <%Josef_Stryker> Dai Shi is sooooo fun
[0:35:13] <Leafboi125> But fables is dope at, just beat us yesterday
[0:35:18] <notsoy> the mario & luigi RPGs are also great games that carry on a little bit of the spirit of TTYD

[0:35:37] <Self_esteampunk> Super paper mario is also a good game but its on the wii and not turnbased so people boot it

[0:35:46] <+lethallylactic> @worldbrand Nah, you'd be fine.
[0:35:46] <Esparsenior> Honestly, Super Paper Mario is a pretty good sequel to TTYD considering how high the bar was raised
[0:35:47] <%FuqBoiSlim> @gonewithlaw donations and subs

[0:36:25] <%r0chelimit> Teppen?
[0:36:27] <%Proxzo> Yeah, I'm glad that Origami King actually turned out to be really good. Out of context a lot about it seems off. But Within the game, everything feels great.
[0:36:28] <cosmicgoatee> you can like a character and not like the game Reggie

[0:36:45] <%Karkatstoaster> @worldbrand no, they actually explain (not in detail, mind) that there was some magical event that altered the bugs, which is why they’re intelligent and don’t have all the same characteristics
[0:36:45] <%jiggy_snipe> oh my Nero deck Kappa

[0:38:33] <cosmicgoatee> Asriel and Azrael crossover Kappa
[0:38:36] <%LoVezineTheAir> @redoctoberwolf fair enough, I can accept story being lacking as long as I'm still having fun
[0:38:46] <%gnoame> Hopefully Nintendo pulls their heads out of their butt at some point and rescinds the whole "no messing with Mario universe stuff" and lets Paper Mario go nuts again.
[0:38:53] <%psidefx> Right on time
[0:38:53] <zamzoph> Woolie: typical Baiken "player"
[0:38:55] <sonofthedeepsouth> Make Woolie play unmodded morrowind. Gets out of Seyda Nyn and turns off the game.
[0:38:58] <%jiggy_snipe> does Woolie actually enjoy Baiken's playstyle?
[0:38:58] <%jinking79> Sho w/persona from P4AU
[0:39:06] <%Karkatstoaster> I wish I could play fighting games other than smash. I’ve tried before but My brain just can’t adapt to the weirdness of doing a motion for an action instead of just hitting a button.

[0:44:14] <%Proxzo> @JohnAtDawn There's a lot of misconceptions about Origami King. It's actually a great game.

[0:44:35] <+Grayhammatter> ROYAL GUARD
[0:44:35] <%lewdskeletor13> Origami King is not up to TTYD writing, but it’s still really good in its own right
[0:44:39] <%Proxzo> @Kickin_Against_the_Switz Origami King is good. Weak Chapter 1, but after that amazing.
[0:44:43] <%Taglog7> OS

[0:44:45] <%Asuterisuku> Woolie is a card-carrying member of the Royal Guard.
[0:44:45] <%Karkatstoaster> @abnormalvoid a bit more complicated. In a lot of translations she self-identifies as a girl
[0:44:46] <%RedoctoberWolf> it's got music and environments and that's it to me
[0:44:50] <%hawk_rush> I think the tutorial is WAY too long
[0:44:50] <+Kickin_Against_the_Switz> good to hear it's still good at least 😊
[0:44:51] <skyheys> @abnormalvoid the localization choices in both directions are b/c the original script can come off as Obama bashing
[0:44:57] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @cosmicgoatee I mean goombella is canonically a goomba version of some super hot college girl so I don't blame you
[0:44:58] <%hawk_rush> And to get to the end of chapter 1 is a slog

[0:45:12] <%Ancopro> open book test
[0:45:13] <missingangle> For people playing Origami King, are battles completely useless? that was word being spread, which idk might make or break the game for me, but it depends

[0:45:26] <brachydios777> Hey, wha happun?
[0:45:27] <%LoVezineTheAir> it's more puzzle-action than RPG though it does have RPG elements
[0:45:30] <@Solidus_113> you have to literally time travel
[0:45:33] <%hawk_rush> @missingangle Idk about others, but I've been finding battles useless... maybe I'm not doing it right
[0:45:34] <%HitchhikingThrough> Thats not what I remember happening with the do combo
[0:45:36] <%andrex2311> you are poking the hornet's nest Woolie careful
[0:45:39] <%Proxzo> @missingangle No, Money = EXP. you need to fight to earn coins and confetti to solve puzzles and upgrade yourself.
[0:45:43] <+IceyCone> I absolutely do not think battles are useless, you get a lot of money but the game will make you spend that money as fast as you can
[0:45:43] <%Th3SmartAlec> YOU ALL HEARD HIM

[0:51:23] <%Ancopro> meanin BP run is superior
[0:51:25] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[0:51:27] <%blaze__drag> it is useful cause it means you can essentially respec a level if you need to
[0:51:28] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[0:51:28] <%TheLemuroid> Doesn't that make the badges better for being more flexible
[0:51:29] <+Juriasu> the flower monkaS
[0:51:29] <%Asuterisuku> Sawano is also responsible for high-profile soundtracks such as Attack on Titan, Guilty Crown, and Kill la Kill.

[0:51:44] <GenericSoda> thanks reggie
[0:51:45] <+marumariball> cant get hit for ten if you equip defense badges
[0:51:49] <%Asuterisuku> So woolie, about that body theft.
[0:51:49] <+ItsCaptainDisco> This is not a Twitch Plays? What the hell?
[0:51:50] <%eriksdrums> Hey! Now that I'm here early; You can press Z on the badge sorting menu to sort by BP to make badge management easier! (y)
[0:51:51] <%blaze__drag> it's also useful for BP only runs
[0:51:52] <+Kickin_Against_the_Switz> I'm playing through 1 ATM and wondering if I should find some way to go through it's story before 2
[0:51:54] <hassanico2> Did Reggie lose weight?
[0:51:59] <%gnoame> Can't get hit for 10 if you parry
[0:52:00] <%JohnAtDawn> Except the game doesn't let you grind :^
[0:52:00] <DontChuckle98> You ever think of trying out Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga after this?
[0:52:01] <%psidefx> We have stopped tIme
[0:52:05] <Snakes_dk> i playedd it casually first time, and had no problems

[0:52:14] <Blunder_Blue> There's a character for that available after Chapter 5
[0:52:14] <%lewdskeletor13> I’m just here to watch y’all play, idc if it’s good gameplay or not
[0:52:16] <+Grayhammatter> can't get hit for 10 if you don't get hit
[0:52:20] <%NottaAlotta> In other words, it'll be fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine
[0:52:22] <+TheOneCalledRock> isnt BP runs literally *the best* run in general?
[0:52:23] <the_saltiest> superstar saga is my jam
[0:52:25] <+Sliverits> Woolie, do you get worried that being very overleved might diminish the experience of the game?

[0:53:22] <hassanico2> I saw someone play Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga blind while ONLY levelling up damage and he made it through
[0:53:24] <penitentpentwitch> I'd honestly suggest keeping a small pad to jot down anything you 'learned' that wasn't intuited naturally. Then just check it before starting up your next stream so you move forward rather than make a mistake you forgot from last stream. Especially since you're juggling many games.
[0:53:24] <%HitchhikingThrough> No woolieGLORY

[0:53:27] <%psidefx> Is this feeling I have called... FUN?
[0:53:28] <nyacoo> No fun allowed
[0:53:32] <%Asuterisuku> The all BP run is for masters of the game's defensive mechanics and that's all I will say about it.
[0:53:33] <PhantomMaskJr> Quit having fun and play the game I want you to!!! BabyRage
[0:53:34] <pookam> the run in fine, critics can mad themselves to tears
[0:53:35] <skyheys> I wish Woolie would play Mege Man Zero and get D Ranks just to piss off chat
[0:53:39] <BrachyZoid> I believe that if you are following a guide, why bother playing the game? just watch a let's play.
[0:53:39] <%Proxzo> Why watch Woolie play if you're not here for his perception and takes on the game?
[0:53:41] <%jiggy_snipe> Woolie is playing games wrong KappaHD
[0:53:45] <hassanico2> @kikoeru_san no we are well in the Doopliss arc
[0:53:46] <+outer_monologue> the game is balance so that if you never level hp, you can make up for it with badges, items and party members
[0:53:48] <%Solidnick18> lol
[0:53:50] <kumaprime> It's fun to figure it out on your own
[0:53:53] <%jiggy_snipe> he should play woolieGIRLS only
[0:53:57] <cosmicgoatee> to be fair some games you want to 100% optimally on your own time, but its for fun & also your first time with games like this, enjoy iy
[0:53:59] <%Karkatstoaster> Galaxy Brain: for some fighting game players woolieFUN and woolieGLORY are the same

[1:01:01] <%Karkatstoaster> @cosmicgoatee it’s fine, no one can hate Homestuck fans more than ourselves
[1:01:02] <%kyh9> Everything is better than Sticker Star
[1:01:02] <@Menitta> Its super good
[1:01:03] <+TheOneCalledRock> so yeah chat how good is origami king, i hear it is a slow start, but gets good
[1:01:03] <Snakes_dk> best since super papaer mario
[1:01:04] <%Superbro64> @akuda_bar screw you shroobs were a TRIP in partners in time Kappa
[1:01:05] <+Juriasu> some people want to maybe have some rpg in this rpg game

[1:01:06] <Darren716> Super is very different but it's amazing
[1:01:07] <%Garthunox> Top 5
[1:01:08] <NeroInfinite> Butnever forget MXC
[1:01:08] <%gatorafan> Easily a top 5 LP Kappa
[1:01:11] <hassanico2> On a replay of SPM, it does have some noticeable faults but is still great
[1:01:12] <seniormeatbox> but BUG FABLES tho guys
[1:01:12] <+charmquarke> @akuda_bar I thought that Bowser's inside story was pretty much online with Superstar saga
[1:01:13] <%Proxzo> Origami has a lot to Offer
[1:01:14] <+IceyCone> Sticker Star is bad, but I will always stan color splash being a perfectly fine game
[1:01:15] <milhousego> I wanted to buy the new paper mario, but I've heard it's subpar. anyone have any suggestions for another game of similar pricing?
[1:01:15] <%Solidnick18> sticker star was not good
[1:01:15] <Zeneeba> Code monkeys was indeed trash. but it was funny trash.
[1:01:16] <Hyper_charger> not divisive, just good but not RPG
[1:01:16] <%baronblank> og paper mario is fantastic imo, step down from ttyd sure but really good
[1:01:18] <%Ancopro> color splash was the worst to me
[1:01:18] <%andrex2311> better then trash but not as good as "DA GOOD SHIT"
[1:01:20] <%Asuterisuku> Skip Sticker Star, all the others are good.
[1:01:21] <prime_name> God I wish the gamecube was the current gen

[1:01:40] <%p4ntless> every paper mario since super paper mario is our punishment for not appreciating super paper mario
[1:01:41] <Zalthia> @woolieversus If were talking platformers, Psychonauts would be awesome
[1:01:44] <%arcielardor> cheer500 Hey Woolie, you hear about M.A.S.S. Builder? It's a mech hack-and-slash with a crazy-detailed mech customization mechanic. There's a demo if you want to see if it's in your wheelhouse. Also I was watching a retrospective on Kamen Rider and between the '70's and now, there's a sliding scale between feathered glam-rock hair disappearing and the gimmicks getting more elaborate.

[1:25:15] <%Ancopro> the backtrack is intense this chapter
[1:25:15] <missingangle> This is a GREAT level, from the story to the character, but the backtracking SUCKS
[1:25:15] <penitentpentwitch> The padding is real!
[1:25:16] <MayorRev> coin!
[1:25:17] <GenericSoda> LUL
[1:25:17] <%blaze__drag> AND THEN GUESS WHAT YOU GET TO DO ONCE YOU GET THERE

[1:25:19] <+Thunderhog> High quality padding
[1:25:19] <pmmori> @WoolieVersus this is chapter 4, like devil may cry 4
[1:25:19] <twieetcha> Fun with backtracking!
[1:25:20] <+RaziWraith> This is literally the only thing not to like about this part though. LUL

[1:26:00] <%LuckyLagomorph> Yeah while I love this game, it has quite possibly the scummiest methods of padding I've ever seen
[1:26:00] <%Solidnick18> jesus
[1:26:00] <%chosenjuan42> Syrup?
[1:26:02] <%crimsonphoenix69> This is why Glitzville is still the top 1 chapter. While this chapter has a great story and atmosphere, the backtracking definitely kills it.
[1:26:06] <%Jetzord> WALK FOREVER *clap clap clapclapclap*
[1:26:10] <%SuperKirby24> ore no waifu?
[1:26:21] <%marshalmorphino2> The cucking continues

[1:26:51] <%LuckyLagomorph> @hassanico2 For the most part. There is one section that's kinda bad with it though.
[1:26:52] <+regis_j_rock> If they made is so Doopliss popped up when you left the manor after getting the "p" it would be so much better.

[1:27:25] <+regis_j_rock> The 2nd and 3rd treck through the forest are justified imo, but 4 and 5 are just padding

[1:27:33] <%mrjojothelion> does the mayor say anything extra?

[1:29:17] <%kyh9> If you buy in bulk, you can get shit up to 75% off

[1:32:49] <%hawk_rush> you have enough coins to spare
[1:32:49] <%CursedNobleman> @feonor2 you can see next to the viewercount, or type !uptime, and the stream starts around 10PST
[1:32:51] <@akuda_bar> there's also a little timer under the video in desktop Twitch that tells you how long the stream has been live for

[1:33:26] <Nyerp> nice
[1:33:27] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> If Mario gets a "First Strike" on a weak enemy (who no longer gives the player Star Points), he will defeat it without entering a battle.

[1:34:50] <Jonny_Uppercut> @Karkatstoaster Thanks homie
[1:34:58] <%chosenjuan42> you can afford a emblem
[1:35:00] <%HitchhikingThrough> Isnt there an upgrade to veil to let you move in the overworld?
[1:35:01] <%chosenjuan42> lol
[1:35:01] <%Papa_Bearman> He said he would have "hid".
[1:35:04] <+regis_j_rock> @zk_nails I don't think that's this area.

[1:35:21] <skyheys> Oh boy.
[1:35:22] <%MontresorMeal> honestly shouldn't veil unless there's some big whammy attack coming up
[1:35:22] <NotHereToStream> backtracking sucks
[1:35:23] <%CursedNobleman> pm64 darhwhile Kreygasm
[1:35:28] <undercoverbarber> Has he found the gold leaf tree?
[1:35:30] <%CursedNobleman> dash-whirl
[1:35:30] <shiny_prinny> yeah it's pretty bad in this game
[1:35:31] <BreakersAweigh> !
[1:35:33] <%HitchhikingThrough> DMC4 IS BEAEST GAEM
[1:35:34] <CappuccinoGuil> @HitchhikingThrough even if there is, they can't leave Twilight Town yet
[1:35:35] <benbag13> @Papa_Bearman not in battle in the overworld
[1:35:37] <Snowfellow> @undercoverbarber ye
[1:35:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @undercoverbarber he did
[1:35:38] <%marshalmorphino2> It wasn’t terrible, but it could have warped you back
[1:35:41] <+TenguGemini> backtracking is imo this game's biggest flaw
[1:35:43] <%NottaAlotta> Veil uses up 2 actions, Vivians' turn when she uses it and her next turn when she brings Mario back.
[1:35:44] <+ph_oni> 360ing
[1:35:47] <+Wilabeen1997> Yeah this chapter is the worst for backtracking
[1:35:47] <%chosenjuan42> up stairs
[1:35:47] <skyheys> It all funnels back to the top
[1:35:49] <jetboots> Top floor
[1:35:49] <SixthSun2> Nah
[1:35:50] <nimu290> is woolie going for danger mario?
[1:35:51] <cosmicgoatee> you gotta go back probably to the top

[1:35:55] <bbblaketwitching> what's going on currently if someone doesn't mind updating me?
[1:36:02] <%Karkatstoaster> @angel42199 yes but only wholesome cuddly Lewds where you comfort her and tell her that she’s beautiful no matter what beldam says UWU
[1:36:03] <%HitchhikingThrough> @nimu290 nah
[1:36:06] <%marshalmorphino2> Dooplis is back in his room right?

[3:14:31] <+Lazyjoules> FALSE
[3:14:33] <KatabolicRage> it's more expensive than earth tremor

[3:14:52] <%CursedNobleman> @Th3SmartAlec 'draw a circle around enemies AS MANY TIMES AS YOU CAN' LUL
[3:14:56] <%Karkatstoaster> Mowz the bowzt
[3:14:57] <NiktenKing> but it doesnt have tremor effect
[3:14:57] <bbblaketwitching> you could have gone so higher than 4
[3:14:58] <@akuda_bar> you also didn't do it as many times as you could
[3:15:07] <%RedoctoberWolf> you could have done it like two or three more times
[3:15:09] <+Wilabeen1997> You can do more
[3:15:10] <%Th3SmartAlec> @CursedNobleman But what do I do after the first circle?
[3:15:10] <SixthSun2> Plane
[3:15:14] <%MonsterEnvy> @WoolieVersus However you could have done the circle more itimes remember you stopped
[3:15:17] <twieetcha> Boss room
[3:15:17] <+Thunderhog> @WoolieVersus Also you can custom the circle size, so on 1 enemy you can just churn butter around it and do a ton
[3:15:22] <%MonsterEnvy> and it's a time limit
[3:15:23] <+AJiiij> @th3smartalec more circles
[3:15:34] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> you can do 15 or more
[3:15:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> @AJiiij I know, I'm being a jack ass
[3:15:39] <%hawk_rush> just appeal 4Head
[3:15:44] <irregularly_irregular> it seems like we keep coming back to this level lol

[3:15:53] <+AJiiij> @th3smartalec LUL my mistake
[3:15:53] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> yes
[3:15:53] <MyNameIsRasus> Reggie is correct
[3:15:54] <bbblaketwitching> its a time limit
[3:15:54] <%tigerfang86> .....
[3:15:55] <nxflre> theres also one more trip back
[3:15:55] <NiktenKing> yes
[3:15:56] <%CursedNobleman> IKEA instructions. screw bolt as many times as you can
[3:15:57] <%ozmon> Reggie right
[3:15:58] <+Lazyjoules> ...so?
[3:15:58] <%KityLinn> lol
[3:16:00] <nxflre> with a new ability
[3:16:02] <NiktenKing> so?
[3:16:03] <tttruest> its time-based right?
[3:16:03] <Millionton> you can do more circle if you didn't stop and draw the circle smaller
[3:16:04] <skyheys> @irregularly_irregular There's even more stuff here later
[3:16:05] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> so?
[3:16:07] <%GoneWithLaw> Reggie is right
[3:16:08] <%ozmon> You can do smaller circles, and make a lot more
[3:16:12] <Otatoptohami> like two different conversations lol
[3:16:13] <%MonsterEnvy> @WoolieVersus For like a second it's time based not number of circles
[3:16:15] <+Wilabeen1997> Reggie is right
[3:16:15] <slawson619> This looks exactly like I hoped it would
[3:16:18] <%Th3SmartAlec> But a smaller circle is FASTER
[3:16:19] <noobpsyboticus> literally what is woolie talking about
[3:16:19] <+Juriasu> yeah and smaller circles draw faster
[3:16:20] <nxflre> time limit
[3:16:23] <%baronblank> smaller circles still means more circles, reggie is correct
[3:16:24] <bbblaketwitching> yeah but you can get much more "ones"
[3:16:24] <%tigerfang86> time limit
[3:16:24] <%CursedNobleman> Math?! NotLikeThis
[3:16:25] <+Zenryoku21> woolie needs to learn the jump stylish for lots of star meter
[3:16:25] <Hyper_charger> time limit
[3:16:26] <%hawk_rush> they'll figure it out, don't worry
[3:16:26] <+Wilabeen1997> It’s time based not number
[3:16:27] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> time limit
[3:16:27] <jettsetter> time limit
[3:16:28] <MyNameIsRasus> It's a time limit
[3:16:29] <%kyh9> Over three enemies
[3:16:33] <Millionton> time limit
[3:16:33] <%Th3SmartAlec> Reggie the God

[3:35:50] <%lewdskeletor13> BEELZEBUB
[3:35:50] <JeoDood> no
[3:35:50] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> no
[3:35:50] <%Exiliator> Nah
[3:35:51] <missingangle> you only learned about the demon then
[3:35:52] <hassanico2> It was new
[3:35:52] <rosemon5001> KIRBY THE DEMON
[3:35:52] <Drusain> The information was there was a calamity
[3:35:53] <StryfeDragon> You did not have the information prior
[3:35:53] <%SuperKirby24> woolieONEGUY actually saved it? Kappa
[3:35:53] <MyNameIsRasus> TEC was telling you
[3:35:54] <Sol_Install> nope
[3:35:54] <KatabolicRage> No, it was multiple choice with obviously wrong answers to leak info to peach
[3:35:54] <+gutlesscoward> no, it was the entire point of the quiz that you didnt
[3:35:54] <Darthkitten_Prime> Nope, you never had the information
[3:35:55] <bbblaketwitching> not
[3:35:55] <abelincoln_catpuncher> no
[3:35:56] <Nyerp> no you weren't supposed to know
[3:35:56] <%Ancopro> thats how you find out
[3:35:57] <%eriksdrums> VaatiVidya's true form
[3:35:57] <+Euphbugg> you did not at the time
[3:35:57] <+CptBritches> No you had to figure it out from the choices
[3:35:57] <niozonbi> Not
[3:35:57] <%StarMechV> we didn't
[3:35:58] <%chosenjuan42> It was a big reveal
[3:35:58] <nxflre> you learned it at the sa,e tiome
[3:36:01] <%Ancopro> peach guessing
[3:36:02] <cosmicgoatee> nope
[3:36:02] <%lewdskeletor13> No you didn’t
[3:36:03] <+QuadraticGravity> You didn't have the information, TEC was phrasing it as a quiz to leak info.
[3:36:03] <Darthkitten_Prime> It was TEC's way of telling you
[3:36:04] <bbblaketwitching> multiple choice quiz
[3:36:05] <Take1two> TEC was being sneaky in telling you
[3:36:05] <%AJiiij> we didnt
[3:36:05] <%Th3SmartAlec> That was supposed to tell you in the first place
[3:36:05] <Prevot> TEC was giving you info
[3:36:06] <kulmoth> @WoolieVersus the computer doesn't let you choose wrong
[3:36:07] <niozonbi> The point of the quiz was to inform Peach indirectly
[3:36:07] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> Tech was giving you info
[3:36:08] <%TheLemuroid> TEC was exploiting a loophole to tell you
[3:36:09] <shiny_prinny> TEC was telling you through multiple choice
[3:36:09] <%Proxzo> The Story was that TEC was telling you
[3:36:10] <Blunder_Blue> TEC told you EVERYTHING.
[3:36:10] <+IceyCone> you didn't, tec was secretly telling you
[3:36:10] <+GreenCMD> TEC was leaking the info to you
[3:36:10] <cerellium> thats why peach thanked him
[3:36:11] <%NottaAlotta> That was TEC telling peach by way of quiz
[3:36:11] <%Papa_Bearman> The point was for TEC to give you info without directly telling Peach.
[3:36:13] <%LoVezineTheAir> TEC's way of telling you
[3:36:14] <+Lazyjoules> PICKLE STONE
[3:36:15] <%bread_assassin> The other two options were dumb on purpose.
[3:36:15] <StryfeDragon> The revealment was indeed DURING the quiz
[3:36:16] <%Karkatstoaster> No, TEC was working around his programming to tell peach
[3:36:16] <%blaze__drag> the point was that that was how TEC was trying to inform peach while staying within his programming
[3:36:17] <%AJiiij> LUL

[3:43:11] <%eriksdrums> The four heroes eventually succeeded and founded their own kingdom, a place called "New Londo"
[3:43:14] <%Karkatstoaster> Vio x Shadow otp
[3:43:15] <BlueFusionVolt> Is that a jab to amazing mirror or link four swords?
[3:43:19] <Run44forrest> four swords is cool tho

[3:44:06] <%Mr_Ease> I would LOVE a party based Zelda turn based RPG
[3:44:12] <MyNameIsRasus> That would involve Nintendo breaking the mold
[3:44:15] <+Juriasu> new characters in a nintendo game?
[3:44:15] <%tigerfang86> @Karkatstoaster TOAD...... ACT 4!!!!
[3:44:16] <dinnydanny777> l o R e
[3:44:16] <+RyTYoung> but we need MOAR LINKAGE
[3:44:18] <%sunnythedrunk> Four playable Champions PogChamp
[3:44:19] <%RedoctoberWolf> no everyone's toads and links
[3:44:21] <niozonbi> The manga gives all the Links different personalities
[3:44:24] <glass_marcus> Kirby > Zelda in this regard
[3:44:26] <MyNameIsRasus> oops all links
[3:44:26] <%TheLemuroid> Imagine of Breath of the Wild party members did more
[3:44:26] <prime_name> @Mr_Ease I didn't know I needed that until now.
[3:44:26] <%Superbro64> zelda needs more characters that arent link :/
[3:44:27] <skyheys> No, Four Link is best, FUCK creativity
[3:44:34] <%SomersaultJustice> eh

[3:44:36] <penitentpentwitch> Breath of the Wild RPG, Let'sa Go
[3:44:45] <%hawk_rush> I want to play this game so bad
[3:44:50] <alphalejandro> Maybe, a Link, a goron a zora and maybe a kokiri
[3:44:50] <%hawk_rush> c'mon nintedo
[3:44:51] <%AJiiij> it really seems like people had fun making this game, with all the extra shit that totally isnt neccessary
[3:44:55] <dinnydanny777> All of the Four Links are different characters though
[3:44:55] <niozonbi> Kreygasm
[3:44:56] <flowdere> didnt purple link join the darkside
[3:44:58] <%lewdskeletor13> This would be a cool game
[3:44:58] <Bguy32> Stroke not hard enough
[3:44:59] <Run44forrest> if it was different characters everyone would fight over who got to be link
[3:45:06] <al0nem0nster> Welp
[3:45:06] <UltimateDomon> Koopa had vinegar strokes
[3:45:13] <projecthazoid> The Legend of Zelda Curse of the Moon

[3:47:42] <%Karkatstoaster> @woolieversus read the four swords manga if you have time, it’s short and rad as fuck. I do agree that it would’ve been better to have different characters, (or at least show off different personalities) in the game itself tho.
[3:47:43] <%Proxzo> In context they are unique within the game
[3:47:43] <+Lazyjoules> OK has been funny at least

[3:54:24] <JeoDood> both
[3:54:27] <+FatherGreyBeard> Super Jump
[3:54:27] <shiny_prinny> is she pointing to something outside?
[3:54:29] <zamzoph> I don't really see that comparison holding up well when neither Grant nor Lee were sea captains
[3:54:31] <SixthSun2> She births and kills goblins
[3:54:33] <skyheys> @akuda_bar Theu sure did get content, that's correct!
[3:54:34] <%lewdskeletor13> She’s the alpha and the omega of goblins
[3:54:34] <%AJiiij> shit is EVERYWHERE
[3:54:36] <+marumariball> maybe she's sniffing both rooms
[3:54:42] <jetboots> she's not snoofing tho
[3:54:43] <+GreenCMD> the goblin alpha and the goblin omega
[3:54:47] <%krispen_wa> Woolie gonna QA break this room
[3:54:48] <@akuda_bar> @skyheys the lengths to which you are going to justify backseating are extreme, pal

[3:54:54] <%Th3SmartAlec> Ms. Mowz points towards the thing
[3:54:55] <Syrushmx> She sniffs all the house

[3:55:09] <Blunder_Blue> I think she sniffs the entire area, including the outside.
[3:55:11] <Bguy32> I'm pretty sure it's outside
[3:55:11] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> outside?
[3:55:16] <skyheys> @akuda_bar I'm not? I'm saying it wasn't a big deal woolie got here early.
[3:55:16] <SixthSun2> She works with proximity
[3:55:17] <%chosenjuan42> GOBLIN GETS STRONKER
[3:55:17] <%Karkatstoaster> Room is considered part of town
[3:55:19] <%AJiiij> I think it's an area check, not a room check
[3:55:28] <+Thunderhog> @WoolieVersus her snoofs track the entire immediate area. the whole loading zone, inside rooms and outside

[3:59:07] <%RedoctoberWolf> You've discovered the met
[3:59:09] <NotHereToStream> thats how danger mario runs become very dangerous
[3:59:11] <shoryukenabotch> AKA DA JUMPMAN
[3:59:12] <%SomersaultJustice> hammers are still useful for high armor enemies
[3:59:13] <niozonbi> Kappa
[3:59:13] <%chosenjuan42> no
[3:59:17] <%Th3SmartAlec> no
[3:59:18] <BigDaddyofCincinnati> Only enemies
[3:59:20] <%Ancopro> and now you take off ALL hammer badges to get BIG points
[3:59:20] <nxflre> only battles

[3:59:40] <%Solidnick18> first attack
[3:59:42] <nxflre> remove first attack
[3:59:47] <undercoverbarber> Hammer throw for cieling enemies
[3:59:48] <%MontresorMeal> Quake Hammer still good for flippin' and ceiling boyz
[3:59:48] <grimshuck> ceiling enemies
[3:59:51] <%Papa_Bearman> You could sell Hammer Throw.
[3:59:51] <Syrushmx> do it
[3:59:52] <bbblaketwitching> jumps are now 100% the optimal strat
[3:59:55] <nxflre> what no remove!
[3:59:57] <+QuadraticGravity> Power Smash + First?
[3:59:59] <+Grayhammatter> we going jumpman?
[4:00:06] <%NottaAlotta> only use first attack for sidequests really
[4:00:09] <bbblaketwitching> thats fair
[4:00:09] <+marumariball> maybe FP points
[4:00:11] <nxflre> Multigone too. Partners can attack multi-ple
[4:00:12] <%GoneWithLaw> take off Power Bounce. It's easy mode.
[4:00:13] <ShiningAxis> Damage dodge
[4:00:14] <pochecito> power smash?
[4:00:14] <+Zenryoku21> jumpman means no quake
[4:00:17] <%sunnythedrunk> Multi bounce?
[4:00:18] <+Snipershot489> Vivian could deal with ceiling enemies
[4:00:18] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:00:18] <bbblaketwitching> other hammers?
[4:00:18] <%Ancopro> power smash?
[4:00:19] <+Wilabeen1997> Maybe FP?
[4:00:20] <+marumariball> you can hold healing items for FP
[4:00:21] <twieetcha> Woolie you wanna do a jump only build?
[4:00:22] <DragonSpooker> Do we really neeed more Power
[4:00:23] <%Proxzo> maybe another level
[4:00:25] <Take1two> How close are you to another level?
[4:00:25] <SixthSun2> Best wait for next level

[4:05:09] <@akuda_bar> @Thunderhog my theory is that her tail kinda works like an accordion made up a bunch of stretching strips, and shes' too close to the camera so you can see all the strips from underneath where they're lit badly
[4:05:11] <+CptBritches> Lmao

[4:23:25] <%AJiiij> @abelincoln_catpuncher just party management and shenanigans, nothing huge

[4:23:29] <%Irridium> Matador gonna fucking make people cry I can't wait
[4:23:30] <%SomersaultJustice> but Mario is older, so wouldn't that make Luigi Mario's stand?

[4:23:41] <%sunnythedrunk> Trauma Center Pog
[4:23:47] <%RedoctoberWolf> trauma center slaps
[4:23:49] <alphalejandro> o yeah SMT Nocturne remaster
[4:23:49] <penitentpentwitch> Honestly, for SMT5 I hope they carry forward all the QoL, it'd be a waste otherwise
[4:23:50] <+DukeBlack_> Nocturne isn't even hard
[4:23:52] <Drusain> Trumpeter's pretty sick though
[4:24:01] <%SuperKirby24> trauma center's fucking sick
[4:24:07] <%Karkatstoaster> Stroke?
[4:24:08] <+wjones0415> yeah, thats more of a pat question
[4:24:09] <%Superbro64> isnt trauma center where that squidward meme came from?
[4:24:10] <dizimous> Matador, even though he's mostly just hard as a "Can you out 2 and 2 together and get Null:Force"
[4:24:19] <UltimateDomon> Blue Bird is top tier

[4:25:36] <prime_name> free bird?
[4:25:42] <irregularly_irregular> Theme of Pain
[4:25:47] <Jonny_Uppercut> Blue Bird suffers from being the theme to the worst filler imo
[4:25:57] <Gelphaze> Next chapter Captain Wet Woolie will take to the seas.
[4:26:19] <irregularly_irregular> earnest and sincere, you mean it's not all internet memes?
[4:26:21] <%SomersaultJustice> eh

[4:31:55] <+Nintokis> But I still love it
[4:31:59] <%AJiiij> death note is the only story that's really done that for me
[4:31:59] <%Superbro64> Have you ever played any ace attorney games? @woolieversus
[4:32:03] <prime_name> That and Bullshit are hard to balance in stories.
[4:32:19] <%Ancopro> hmmmmmm
[4:32:19] <irregularly_irregular> yeah I feel like Ace Attorney would be right up his alley if he likes that.
[4:32:27] <%SomersaultJustice> PHOENIX WRIGHT LP
[4:32:31] <%Exiliator> play on stream PogChamp
[4:32:33] <%AJiiij> @chatterbox1991 that can happen when it's done badly

[4:32:45] <%Karkatstoaster> Nah too much talking
[4:32:50] <irregularly_irregular> Ghost Trick is sick. Great OST, too.

[4:36:06] <The_Maddness> @WoolieVersus Dont sleep on Flurrie, shes underated, has the second highest HP in the game, and her Life Drain attack pierces defence
[4:36:17] <prime_name> Wonderful botches
[4:36:19] <%Karkatstoaster> Oof. The ghost of 731
[4:36:31] <%SomersaultJustice> she's a good tank
[4:36:33] <cosmicgoatee> listened to it last night the Pat historical stuff showing the homage to Japan 🇯🇵 was really funny but also history grinding LUL
[4:36:34] <DatAsuna> Vivian is best fighter tbh
[4:36:37] <%RedoctoberWolf> everyone forgets her Don't worry
[4:36:46] <alphalejandro> Oh when Vince hurts his back
[4:37:03] <Drusain> I also never really used her
[4:37:08] <%BisoromiBear> snowball it to mario
[4:37:11] <Drusain> But use who you like
[4:37:12] <+xXjuffelXx> She's a tank
[4:37:13] <DatAsuna> Vivian's second upgrade tier makes her my default DPS
[4:37:13] <The_Maddness> You just put her in the front and let her get hit
[4:37:15] <Take1two> VIOLENCE has better def piercing attack anyway
[4:37:20] <%Ancopro> i also slept on her
[4:37:22] <%Superbro64> Man, TTYD must be a DIFFERENT game entirely if you dont have quick switch equipped
[4:37:27] <%Superbro64> what do you even DO?
[4:37:31] <%dmcRedgrave> Sandbags up.
[4:37:32] <Drusain> Great stream Woolie

[4:37:58] <Ultimatefool> Starting the finishing of the fight
[4:38:04] <%sunnythedrunk> Finishing the middle of the fight
[4:38:05] <%NottaAlotta> Any chance you'll touch on Cursed Halo after finishing the series?
[4:38:05] <prime_name> Really looking forward to your thoughts on the ending to Halo 2
[4:38:15] <%gatorafan> Huh?
[4:38:24] <%sunnythedrunk> PogChamp
[4:38:24] <+xXjuffelXx> @Superbro64 you get hit more, but if you don't care about tattle you don't get hit as much
[4:38:29] <%DomunDomunDomun> Will you be checking out the halo infiinite trailer on thursday, or avoiding possible spoilers?
[4:38:32] <%sunnythedrunk> Fantasy strike is dope
[4:38:35] <%RedoctoberWolf> PogChamp
[4:38:52] <xiccy> Fantasy Strike is pretty cool
[4:39:08] <+Nintokis> It struck my fancy. I am now suing for assault
[4:39:56] <%samuraihavoc> halo 2 has been fun to see you go through but 3 is so much fun for me. looking forward to those streams
[4:39:59] <%Superbro64> @xxjuffelxx I imagine TTYD is the bees knees for replay value
[4:40:01] <%SuperKirby24> PogChamp

[0:16:49] <chronoxgp> they're too easy, and then torwards the end almost too hard without poitions
[0:16:50] <%jinking79> better than playing the card game
[0:16:51] <+robobeau> I pretty much bailed on Sun/Moon because I knew I'd be too burnt out to play a proper one on the Switch if finished Sun/Moon
[0:16:53] <%fatal_penguin_> I tolerated 2nd Gen, but that's as far as I could go.
[0:17:00] <DXLelouch24> Woolie you played the worst Pokemon he'll yiu didn't even play gen 3

[0:22:57] <laguerrilha> yep
[0:23:05] <gustavozxd> oh man Witcher 3 LP would be longer than Kotor LUL
[0:23:08] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL
[0:23:13] <ManOfReason> Oh it’s very hard anime
[0:23:18] <Dragon_Batman> LUL so no anime?
[0:23:19] <Cherokia666> That's 100% what Woolie is saying
[0:23:27] <luckycloud91> Hey woolie, what did you think about this year e3?
[0:23:29] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Woolie hates Anime Confirmed Kappa
[0:23:43] <Dragon_Batman> It's sci-fi anime?
[0:23:44] <gigacanuck> also 2B's ass
[0:23:46] <$cherubs_anonymous> It's not saturated
[0:23:46] <Cherokia666> he does, he just likes mechs
[0:23:49] <artoflec> Moe, the "cute" proportions
[0:23:53] <+zanzibar_junker> Woolie read Dungeon Meshi
[0:23:55] <gigacanuck> god damn, 2B's ass
[0:23:59] <masterfire23> woolie is trying to reject his weeb
[0:24:05] <+bbHighvalor> woolie actually hated gurren
[0:24:12] <Jackomaning> I liked playing MonHun and thinking how anime it was and then playing God Eater and realizing how far I had to go
[0:24:15] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> It looks generic anime you mean
[0:24:16] <ManOfReason> Only the characters are anime in Nier not the world entirely
[0:24:17] <GentlemenWalrus> Woolie the fake weeb
[0:24:21] <haveswordmuststing> theres full generic anime, then anime design applied to normal modelling and shading
[0:24:36] <Dragon_Batman> There is a small bit of character customization.
[0:24:39] <IndoorSitup> Astral Chain has a character creator by the way.
[0:24:46] <$cherubs_anonymous> The words you guys are looking for is "Light Novel aesthetic"
[0:24:52] <+zanzibar_junker> Still anime as fuck
[0:24:53] <artoflec> well Astral Chain has a character creator so that might be why their design is pretty basic right now artofl1Hmm
[0:24:54] <laguerrilha> the protagonists look band and boring. default anime guy/girl
[0:24:59] <haveswordmuststing> @cherubs_anonymous thats a good word for it
[0:25:01] <masterfire23> astral chain just need a to be a jojo game ,fixed
[0:25:04] <+HiroTSK5> Woolie likes 90's Anime, not modern Anime
[0:25:05] <Ashenik1> is avatar an anime?? :?

[0:25:30] <+KinguinHD> Did hey already play senior
[0:25:33] <+TDotGoat> 0.5 FPS
[0:25:37] <+KinguinHD> SEKIRO
[0:25:44] <%GohanEgret> just started
[0:25:45] <Dragon_Batman> Yea you can change up the avatar character. I don't think by a huge degree though
[0:25:47] <gustavozxd> Hopefully astral chain character creator doesn't have the awful black color skin that some anime games have where it's a jank tan
[0:25:50] <alexandrecau> native tongue
[0:25:53] <+KinguinHD> thx
[0:25:55] <$cherubs_anonymous> Overexposure is a damned thing
[0:26:10] <%jinking79> too much Jojo part 8
[0:26:11] <Ashenik1> why, is is just because it wasnt made in japan ?
[0:26:22] <artoflec> the new Tales game is pretty different looking, looks more like Granblue or something
[0:26:33] <IndoorSitup> Woolie hates weeb shit confimed.
[0:26:34] <gustavozxd> Tales of arise does look way more generic than others
[0:26:40] <Dragon_Batman> I think they made a black dude in the nintendo tree house first day
[0:26:41] <prime_name> That's a bit limiting view on things.

[0:27:07] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> I understand that feel
[0:27:18] <laguerrilha> Yeah, the only bad part of Japanese game design is making the protagonist look generic so people can insert themselves
[0:27:27] <artoflec> I think Tales of Arise looks incredible, environment and creatures mostly, teh character design has always been pretty generic
[0:27:30] <gustavozxd> goddamn Kirito

[0:28:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> Big Reveal, every single Gem in Steven Universe is an ACTUAL gemstone.
[0:28:24] <rad_dude123465> Woolie never played Minecraft
[0:28:27] <DXLelouch24> -_-
[0:28:30] <Kristoffers> an amethyst is also a gem
[0:28:31] <alrobot2014> woolie was able to hard dodge minecraft
[0:28:32] <DrBeanie> But you knew they were named after gemstones . . .
[0:28:34] <gustavozxd> it came from Minecraft and then they made it into an actual thing
[0:28:34] <@Commando_Joe> He's not a geologist guys
[0:28:35] <artoflec> I collected rocks and minerals as a kid so I know lots of cool rocks :nerd:

[0:28:56] <Kghaleon> @Commando_Joe Is a Ruby a cartoon character? Never heard of them.
[0:28:57] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL
[0:29:00] <+Mvrdok_> @WoolieVersus It was hard to obtain that's why blue was a royal color at some point, only rich people could pay for it
[0:29:00] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> MONSTER HUNTER
[0:29:03] <Kristoffers> what's the point of a pretty shuriken lol
[0:29:05] <+TDotGoat> but you did play Minecraft!
[0:29:08] <@Commando_Joe> I know it because of World of Warcraft >_>

[0:29:25] <flubber3d> Devil May Craft
[0:29:26] <DXLelouch24> it was in SOTN
[0:29:26] <Tucker0603> I don't know it from me necraft
[0:29:27] <Dragon_Batman> I don't think it's in world is it?
[0:29:28] <s_snowball> i learned it from valkyrie profile
[0:29:29] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> The old games had Lapis Lazuli
[0:29:29] <%Gogogolem> woolie do you know what garnet, or amythest are?
[0:29:30] <IndoorSitup> WOOLIE DECLARES WAR ON MINECRAFT
[0:29:34] <DXLelouch24> guess your a fraud Woolie
[0:29:36] <gigacanuck> >not playing knowing the names of many gemstones because you play Dwarf Fortress
[0:29:38] <masterfire23> Minecraft playthrough SwiftRage
[0:30:00] <Nyerp> has anyone told woolie he should get malcontent
[0:30:07] <gigacanuck> I bet he doesn't even know where to find Tanzanite
[0:30:08] <gustavozxd> one day someone's gonna have to force Woolie into playing vanilla Minecraft, any version, just get him to play and hate it
[0:30:10] <Dragon_Batman> I mean the spear and axe are a good go
[0:30:11] <artoflec> I learned a lot of rocks and minerals from an educational Magic School Bus game
[0:30:14] <haveswordmuststing> @woolieversus also multiple playthroughs is needed for those upgrades
[0:30:33] <%Solidnick18> yeah
[0:30:47] <xdeathknightx> If billy plays that would it be Minhcraft? Kappa
[0:30:48] <+Mvrdok_> @WoolieVersus It was rare to obtain, that's why blue was a royal color at some point, only rich people could pay for it
[0:30:51] <+UrielCobalt> Dragon Ball Z, Android 17 and 18's names are Lapis and Lazuli
[0:31:15] <straydog505> Woolie are u playing on ps4?
[0:31:17] <haveswordmuststing> speaking of, need to get that shura ending caleb3 caleb4

[0:33:02] <MonstarGrrrl> test
[0:33:23] <%Solidnick18> sure
[0:33:33] <laguerrilha> mine would be the toilet
[0:33:45] <duraju> a door way in a random cave leads to a room at a rooftop...
[0:33:45] <+zanzibar_junker> Dengeki online had a great stream of samurai shodown
[0:33:54] <%mh9s> only one way out of the woolie hole
[0:34:23] <+zanzibar_junker> Hanzo looks fun
[0:34:23] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[0:34:27] <Rain_Mage> No one can escape the woolie hole, it is a state of being.
[0:34:30] <+ctommy0720> why does he only have 4 attack dmg wtf
[0:34:37] <arcaderabbit48> @duraju They are NINJAS
[0:34:51] <+zanzibar_junker> It's 30 times 4

[0:35:24] <PinkSocks> 5 skill points is what he means
[0:35:27] <%ctommy0720> ctommy0720 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:35:33] <+Tyler_Ruins_Games> Did anyone use the dragon mask? I never took advantage of it myself all the way through NG+3. Just curious.
[0:35:41] <laguerrilha> its skill points
[0:35:48] <%jinking79> pretty much super end game Attack up
[0:35:53] <+HiroTSK5> The Exp bar feeds skills
[0:36:05] <Jackomaning> @Tyler_Ruins_Games Once you can get it diminishing returns are really bad on attack power
[0:36:05] <+zanzibar_junker> At 45 atk on ng4
[0:36:08] <b1gboss007> never do that, isn't worth it
[0:36:10] <Ashenik1> So woolie streams for living but streams quite rarely :/
[0:36:21] <Dragon_Batman> It's more of a I don't have to buy any skills kinda thing
[0:36:28] <+KinguinHD> Mana gradients
[0:36:29] <xdeathknightx> You should say "know what I mean?" and "drop your shield" more Minh ;)
[0:36:30] <+Tyler_Ruins_Games> @Jackomaning Good point
[0:36:31] <cheffailure> It's a lot more efficient to just gain memories.
[0:36:48] <NDenizen> Even if you do the whole game 4 times with both EXP boosting effects, you never max out your skills without grinding
[0:36:49] <%ctommy0720> its more like I have all the skills I want so I might as well get more attack dmg
[0:36:50] <Kghaleon> It's useless, by the time you get it those points don't matter.
[0:36:52] <NDenizen> the mask is useless
[0:36:59] <Kghaleon> It's literally a NG+ item
[0:37:04] <+zanzibar_junker> It's more an endgame thing woolie

[0:37:25] <RubberFistFight> Eyyy Wooloo what's happening dude

[0:38:00] <a_mad_dragon> tengu SoonerLater
[0:38:16] <Dragon_Batman> He has really only fought second Genjiro

[0:39:44] <+zanzibar_junker> Oh yeah black hat
[0:39:54] <RubberFistFight> @WoolieVersus he's talking about the guy who is located to the upper-right if you're looking at the grandma's house from the spawn point.

[0:41:29] <Dragon_Batman> God has he seen that mob guy, it's been so long
[0:41:30] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:41:42] <%ctommy0720> its not a miyazaki game if it isnt about immortality being a bad thing
[0:41:47] <deviljhojho94> real gamer hours fellas
[0:41:52] <+bubbli97> Woolie saw this dude otherwise he wouldnt have the firecrackers
[0:42:07] <Dragon_Batman> aaah yea that's right
[0:42:08] <%ctommy0720> you can buy them from another vendor
[0:42:18] <RubberFistFight> IS Woolie missing a shinobi tool or something?
[0:42:30] <RAH001> aaaayyee. WoolieCoolie
[0:42:41] <Dragon_Batman> There is way more to that village tho
[0:42:50] <Otatoptohami> Or just have a memory
[0:42:56] <+cvp5127> but that would be an easy mode
[0:43:09] <Eternal_Harmony> what part is woolz on
[0:43:09] <a_mad_dragon> it's called a PEN and PAPER woolie
[0:43:10] <+zanzibar_junker> Did woolie go behind the castle
[0:43:22] <PinkSocks> They want you to get familiar with the map and revisit places.
[0:43:36] <alexandrecau> woolie can't witer
[0:43:42] <Ashenik1> Once otside the cave you can never come back in to it
[0:43:58] <RubberFistFight> Ohhhhh, he's missing the fan hat
[0:44:02] <RubberFistFight> ok
[0:44:18] <%ctommy0720> he needs to find black ferret or whatever
[0:44:21] <Dragon_Batman> I don't think he has gone to that area even
[0:44:59] <%Solidnick18> flame vent has some fun stuff later on
[0:45:03] <Patzzki217> the flame is good for certain bosses
[0:45:13] <Dragon_Batman> I personally really like the spear
[0:45:19] <cheffailure> Umbrella is sold by a midget.
[0:45:24] <+robobeau> Phoenix Lilac Umbrella too OP
[0:45:29] <Tucker0603> sold by black hat
[0:45:35] <castcode> Phoenix Umbrella PogChamp
[0:45:36] <Patzzki217> minh should really tell woolie to find blackhat
[0:45:37] <Dragon_Batman> Yea that Lilac umbrella is really good
[0:45:48] <+zanzibar_junker> Umbrella is great
[0:45:59] <castcode> woolie would love umbrella actually
[0:46:02] <cheffailure> Umbrella is fucking busted.
[0:46:03] <Dragon_Batman> The umbrella attack is really good
[0:46:06] <+Tyler_Ruins_Games> The Umbrella is a top 3 tool
[0:46:08] <%Solidnick18> behind
[0:46:20] <Dragon_Batman> Go find black hat in the ashina catle
[0:46:21] <%Solidnick18> see that
[0:46:22] <Dragon_Batman> area
[0:46:22] <%Solidnick18> yee
[0:46:25] <laguerrilha> umbrella is a bless
[0:46:32] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus ya shoulda had it by now
[0:46:44] <PunishedRaccoon> @WoolieVersus Hi sean
[0:46:44] <%jinking79> u can still get it
[0:46:52] <NDenizen> Umbrella is the best prosthetic in the game by far
[0:46:53] <Patzzki217> lilac umbrella can beat headless without using divine confetti which is handy
[0:46:54] <%Solidnick18> never figured out what the rice did
[0:47:27] <Dragon_Batman> I think the rice was more important to trigger the other ending
[0:47:38] <%Kavtech> @Solidnick18 Just prism stones I think.
[0:47:48] <%Solidnick18> oh
[0:47:49] <Dragon_Batman> Ooooh that rice
[0:47:49] <PunishedRaccoon> woops Soushin
[0:47:51] <%jinking79> can't remember if u can get umbrella off from corps
[0:48:00] <+zanzibar_junker> Yyyyeeesssss
[0:48:12] <Dragon_Batman> Go to ashina catle
[0:48:14] <PinkSocks> It goes into the temple box if you're too late to get the umbrella
[0:48:21] <+Tyler_Ruins_Games> Gotta get that suzaku umbrella upgrade for later too
[0:48:21] <+zanzibar_junker> From blk hat
[0:48:24] <PE4X> you could get it now
[0:48:25] <cheffailure> The umbrella you can easily go look for right now.
[0:48:39] <Patzzki217> the umbrellas easy to get

[0:49:45] <Patzzki217> good start
[0:49:48] <Patzzki217> lmao
[0:49:48] <Dragon_Batman> Yea I'm pretty shure he did, killed granma
[0:49:54] <RubberFistFight> ! BATTERY AT RISK !
[0:50:04] <cheffailure> The worst debuff of all.
[0:50:14] <alexandrecau> black controller now available
[0:51:03] <alexandrecau> minh trying to bring up topic
[0:51:09] <turf_wind_and_fire> It's like being low on gas
[0:51:30] <alexandrecau> he is learning the art of commentary
[0:51:34] <turf_wind_and_fire> Just cause that arrow is close to the end, you still got like another 10 miles out of that bad boy
[0:51:35] <Kristoffers> that's old-ass batteries
[0:51:50] <gigacanuck> man, Wolf needs a flashlight
[0:51:55] <+Eclipse_knight_> you shouldn't let phones get below 30
[0:51:57] <turf_wind_and_fire> OH! I remember Max hitting this part I think
[0:51:58] <RubberFistFight> @WoolieVersus actually that's not true for lithium ion batteries. One of the benefits is no "memory effect". That only effects nickel metal hydride or nickel cadmium batteries
[0:52:23] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> Doctor_Death_Bed subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 6 month streak! 
[0:52:35] <RubberFistFight> well, lead acid as well, but that's more to do with sulfation of the lead plates than any charge/discharge thing.
[0:52:47] <+ontoue> newer types of batteries dont really have that problem
[0:53:10] <RubberFistFight> yeah. Lithium batteries are good for about 5 years and then they just shit the bed all at once.
[0:53:22] <RubberFistFight> as long as you don't leave them DIScharged for too long, that will kill them too.
[0:53:33] <turf_wind_and_fire> Nope nevermind. I'm wrong on where I thought Woolie was.
[0:53:38] <%jinking79> god Sam Sho almost out
[0:53:45] <%Solidnick18> aye
[0:53:49] <castcode> ITS TIME

[0:56:42] <%Solidnick18> at the graveyard

[0:57:46] <+lemuhollow> @WoolieVersus Got to Ashina Castle to get the Umbrella, it IS missable if you go too late
[0:57:47] <%jinking79> in a house
[0:57:50] <cheffailure> Jump down into a building.
[0:57:57] <cheffailure> Hole in a building roof
[0:58:02] <Jackomaning> Hidden is a strong word
[0:58:11] <Dragon_Batman> You just happened to not go down that path
[0:58:13] <Tenchi_G> Look with house with broken roof. Black hat dwarf
[0:58:37] <+Keyd00d> optional =/= missable
[0:58:41] <mrhooppaw> nothing sold is missable because of the item box in the hub.

[0:59:32] <Patzzki217> true sekiro experience
[0:59:35] <+lemuhollow> The umbrella does not go to the item box in hub, I couldn't get it in my first playthough because the seller died
[0:59:46] <worldbrand> I have cats on mars from the cowboy bebop ost stuck in my head, for reasons unrelated to this, but it's really fitting

[1:01:49] <NeroInfinite> Rat man
[1:01:58] <alexandrecau> àPretty sure they don't like being called rats
[1:02:00] <Dragon_Batman> He does not have that death blow no
[1:02:01] <天使42199> @chronoxgp he aint at senpo
[1:02:03] <%Solidnick18> oh yeah
[1:02:03] <%MeAuntieNora> Is that one of Jim Sterling's Boglins
[1:02:04] <%jinking79> ok so Woolie will buy it or Loot off his corpes
[1:02:12] <%wolfofsound> royal authority rats? Nah Imperial authority rats
[1:02:17] <+Tyler_Ruins_Games> AA DB is awesome when you get the chance to use it
[1:02:21] <NeroInfinite> Iron Fortress
[1:02:23] <+ontoue> Is Rat the polite term
[1:02:35] <worldbrand> it's so satisfying but pretty situational
[1:02:46] <cheffailure> Iron fortress baby.
[1:02:48] <Dragon_Batman> You really got to find the moves for some enemies but it's really good when you do it

[1:04:58] <+linSP> i LOVE the antiair for certain enemies
[1:04:59] <%Kavtech> That might be one of the best passive abilities in the game.
[1:05:16] <Dragon_Batman> Other than deathblow life gain
[1:05:17] <Djinnazz> catch them mother fucker leapin.
[1:05:17] <cheffailure> He'll be back here after it's done.
[1:06:03] <%Solidnick18> yep
[1:06:11] <BabyNaBackbrace> Yooo
[1:06:19] <+ontoue> did woolie fight the boss at the end of senpou
[1:06:29] <%WailfulOmnivore> WailfulOmnivore subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:06:31] <Dragon_Batman> no
[1:06:36] <Dragon_Batman> for that boss
[1:06:40] <EddieMayNot> Oh man, the skill that's only circumstantially useful and even when it is useful it's crazy hard to pull off.
[1:07:05] <BabyNaBackbrace> Yeah I've done one anti air kill the whole game
[1:07:13] <gslayer14> i've never used it, is there a specific enemy type it's good for?
[1:07:19] <NukeDaHippies> it's dope as hell tho, eapecially agaunst tgw ghost sharman
[1:07:23] <EddieMayNot> The Helicopter Monks
[1:07:24] <RyuuAoi> We still in this bitch!
[1:07:30] <Jackomaning> Threres a few @gslayer14
[1:07:34] <%Solidnick18> that blackhat
[1:07:37] <EddieMayNot> But, again, it's VERY unreliable.
[1:07:41] <%Kavtech> @EddieMayNot I'll personally disagree on both angles. It's useful for a whole level and the enemies you use it on are predictable.
[1:07:45] <+Tyler_Ruins_Games> You can really hurt the Shichimen warriors with it
[1:07:54] <BabyNaBackbrace> Yeah most enemies that jump you can use it on but the timing and spacing seems picky
[1:08:01] <%Solidnick18> nice
[1:08:12] <Dragon_Batman> I found it pretty easy to use for the enemies in the last area at least
[1:08:25] <BabyNaBackbrace> Mostly I just knock guys out of the air and slash 'em up
[1:08:28] <cheffailure> Senpou Temple time
[1:08:32] <Frolomeo> More like shadows die at least 400 times
[1:08:37] <Nina96> KonCha
[1:09:12] <+reiju_22> KonCha
[1:09:26] <BabyNaBackbrace> I'm currently stuck at what I suspect is the last boss
[1:09:32] <NDenizen> It blocks grabs
[1:09:38] <Sarumarine> I really liked the Iron Umbrella
[1:09:45] <gslayer14> IT BLOCKS GRABS?!?
[1:09:46] <+robobeau> And you can eventually upgrade it to deal with the Headless
[1:09:50] <$Louie_Salmon> Well, much less after the update
[1:09:50] <KasiCrafter> One emblem for each deploy?
[1:10:03] <LTKonnor> Oh no, Woolie found the shield of this game
[1:10:10] <BabyNaBackbrace> I had it upgraded to block Headless right after dealing with my last Headless
[1:10:12] <Frolomeo> Which arm tool leads to a German suplex with a bridge?
[1:10:15] <EddieMayNot> The iron umbrella is pretty useful. The fact that it can parry too is also pretty neat if not too useful.
[1:10:45] <NeroInfinite> IT's an ez mode parry
[1:10:45] <RyuuAoi> !uptime
[1:10:45] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 10 minutes
[1:10:51] <Dragon_Batman> The skill where you attack of it is pretty dope too
[1:11:09] <Jackomaning> @BabyNaBackbrace Can you whisper me which boss? I won't confirm or deny its the last one if you dont want, just curious
[1:11:11] <%Solidnick18> lol
[1:11:17] <%jinking79> Woolie will never be able to guess that last tool
[1:12:10] <EddieMayNot> That'd be a fun weapon in a musou game.
[1:12:10] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[1:12:48] <gustavozxd> masamune date in Sengoku Basara with the wolwerine claw but KATANAS
[1:12:58] <%wolfofsound> @WoolieVersus what about those dudes from naruto that gaara killed
[1:13:07] <gustavozxd> or Tadakatsu Honda who is just a fucking mecha
[1:13:16] <%jinking79> it a good anime, the movie hit or miss
[1:13:19] <CureMode666> we need woolie to play persona 5
[1:13:30] <gustavozxd> Sengoku Basara man we need more of those localised
[1:13:39] <+zanzibar_junker> Woolie which ending is better Escaflowne or GoT?
[1:14:00] <+zanzibar_junker> Or worse
[1:14:19] <Maids4lyfe> Escaflowne had an ending?
[1:14:43] <vodonne1> Hidetaka Miyazaki said in an interview in like 2016-2017 that he would like to make a mech fantasy game and he used Escaflowne as an example
[1:14:48] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Time to parry
[1:14:57] <Djinnazz> aww
[1:15:00] <Maids4lyfe> Mech Souls
[1:15:24] <+robobeau> This is literally the "learn to parry" fight
[1:15:29] <EddieMayNot> Alternatively, Armored Core
[1:15:35] <+Tyler_Ruins_Games> Feel that rhythm!
[1:15:44] <EddieMayNot> which I am still waiting for From why do you make me suffer
[1:15:47] <duraju> its more like a mash parry fight
[1:15:56] <RAH001> he did da thing!
[1:16:01] <天使42199> this boss builds his posture himself all you is block/deflect a little LUL
[1:16:04] <+robobeau> Yeah basically, mash parry
[1:16:07] <+robobeau> It's not great
[1:16:09] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> YEYEY
[1:16:10] <+griffball13> i clapped when he used it
[1:16:16] <%Solidnick18> so ez
[1:16:24] <chronoxgp> I don't understand why people have so much trouble with this system it's just a stamina bar with two sides
[1:16:27] <gigacanuck> if only you'd gotten off that stealth attack
[1:16:36] <%Solidnick18> yes
[1:16:38] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL
[1:16:39] <laserbeaming> Practice those blockstrings
[1:16:41] <duraju> if only...
[1:16:42] <Sarumarine> Skill check boss
[1:16:42] <Bigbaddymike> Spam the parry button like never before Woolie
[1:16:42] <BabyNaBackbrace> this fight's making my hands sweat
[1:16:49] <Bigbaddymike> This is a skill check
[1:16:50] <Jackomaning> this fight is so fun
[1:16:50] <%Solidnick18> then he does a big one you jump on his head
[1:16:53] <%wolfofsound> he's the best at what he does, but he only does one thing LUL
[1:16:54] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> he literally exists to test your parry mash
[1:16:56] <+josiiph> LUL LUL LUL
[1:16:56] <Dragon_Batman> He doesn't remember Giraffe, or did he even fight Giraffe
[1:16:59] <gslayer14> 2 moves but they're both winners
[1:17:02] <duraju> yeyeyeye
[1:17:04] <ThDark> MIssing those good head jumps, but he's easy enough even without em
[1:17:10] <castcode> yeeee
[1:17:11] <%Solidnick18> yep
[1:17:14] <+josiiph> SeemsGood SeemsGood
[1:17:30] <duraju> im assuming he hasn't fought the other one yet?
[1:17:31] <+Tyler_Ruins_Games> It's so simple once it clicks. Just 1-2-3-4 pause 1-2-3-4-5 pause 1. But it is intimidating the first time.
[1:17:32] <+robobeau> I died way too many times to that dude
[1:17:42] <RyuuAoi> Man...FUCK KONAMI.
[1:17:50] <+griffball13> remember your in air counter when you see the sweep coming
[1:18:07] <gustavozxd> idk what happened but indeed fuck Konami
[1:18:18] <%komradedog> immortal blade time next?
[1:18:18] <laserbeaming> You know, I always forget how Mihn looks like and I'm kinda surprised every time I see him on streal LUL
[1:18:22] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> now look at this room full of corpses
[1:18:44] <BabyNaBackbrace> Big secret: jump in that fire
[1:19:21] <Dragon_Batman> Nothing can really stop you from using the monk skills a lot
[1:19:21] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:19:25] <gigacanuck> no passives?
[1:19:28] <gustavozxd> oh man I hope nioh has actual martial arts
[1:19:29] <RyuuAoi> @gustavozxd Just reminiscing on their BS. We lost SO MUCH.
[1:19:36] <RyuuAoi> ...FUCK
[1:19:43] <+linSP> drop your sword!
[1:20:02] <gslayer14> Immaculate!
[1:20:26] <giogio346> this game has no depth
[1:20:28] <duraju> yea, they could've made L1+R2 be another skill
[1:20:28] <+pkmamsters> cum it
[1:20:32] <Djinnazz> they/re realy good.
[1:20:38] <Patzzki217> it sucks that sekiro is so short and its the only souls like game that really hooked me in
[1:21:16] <%jinking79> monk's skills help counter against enemy's sweep attack
[1:21:22] <laserbeaming> I don't like Sekiro's moveset that much.
[1:21:28] <chronoxgp> sekiro is just as long as the other games, it's not short
[1:21:29] <gigacanuck> you get a sense of satisfaction
[1:21:39] <+doc_ock_rokc> I'm trying to get my brother into souls. What game should I recommend to him?
[1:21:52] <LTKonnor> @doc_ock_rokc Dark Souls 2 Kappa
[1:21:55] <laserbeaming> Souls 1, if he can tolerate the Jank
[1:22:04] <laserbeaming> Dark Souls, I mean
[1:22:19] <Dragon_Batman> I would agree, give him tips too
[1:22:26] <gustavozxd> probably bloodborne? That seems to be the most loved one, other than ds1 I guess
[1:22:29] <BabyNaBackbrace> It's got limitations but it's interesting hearing everyone's different experiences in the game, like what tools and techniques you use
[1:22:30] <+Pookiedaexzile> Have they talked about Elden Rings yet
[1:22:43] <+Tyler_Ruins_Games> DaS1 is good for a start; or even DeS if you want to go really old school. Depending on his style of play Bloodborne could also be viable.
[1:22:58] <Dragon_Batman> I don't think we'll be seeing Elden Rings for a good while, if not TGS
[1:23:01] <+doc_ock_rokc> My brother is all about "I don't wanna play a game that is too hard" I recommened bloodborne which he has for free on his PS4 but he won't play it
[1:23:12] <chronoxgp> elden rings will probably be on ps5
[1:23:24] <+griffball13> here we go boyz
[1:23:26] <天使42199> @doc_ock_rokc tell him he is a bitch and a coward
[1:23:27] <NDenizen> shhh chat
[1:23:31] <gslayer14> oh boy
[1:23:35] <%komradedog> ring da bell

[1:23:40] <ilasper1> monkaS
[1:23:41] <EddieMayNot> More info about Elden Rings on the VGA I am calling it RIGHT NOW
[1:23:43] <Dragon_Batman> Maybe play with your brother?, it might be better if he isn't alone?
[1:23:47] <laserbeaming> Dark Souls 1 is not really that hard. I'd say it's a good start.
[1:23:50] <%jinking79> alright Puzzle Time
[1:23:50] <+doc_ock_rokc> @天使42199 He would own the fact that he is a bitch and a coward
[1:23:57] <天使42199> @doc_ock_rokc atpRtsd

[1:24:25] <Kristoffers> lol
[1:24:25] <Tucker0603> ITS TIME
[1:24:28] <BabyNaBackbrace> I heard a lot of people saying Flowing Passage wasn't a good skill, but until I got second-tier Senpou skills I almost used it exclusively
[1:24:28] <+Tyler_Ruins_Games> @doc_ock_rokc Consider DaS 1 then. A shield and some other items can help ease the difficulty. Or just use magic, I suppose.
[1:24:29] <%komradedog> BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[1:24:32] <%Solidnick18> OH

[1:25:38] <laserbeaming> It's so weird that this encounter has a life bar.
[1:25:39] <Dragon_Batman> Stab the monkey but smartly
[1:25:41] <alexandrecau> then you must defeat the monkeys
[1:25:41] <Graxe_> Yeah, don't read chat.
[1:25:42] <Kghaleon> Uh oh, a puzzle segment. We'll be here a while.

[1:46:41] <MonstarGrrrl> woolie take my energy \ Kappa /
[1:46:42] <BabyNaBackbrace> It's an opportunity for folks to stretch their legs, or maybe eat some dinner
[1:46:46] <+titans_ace_jerid> This is just my background noise while tinkering with things, I kinda like it.
[1:46:46] <jubejube56> Stream is okay with 3 hours of puzzles
[1:46:50] <Dingo_Eejit> What are we looking for? how (not) cryptic can we be?
[1:46:52] <+Pookiedaexzile> Woolie is a FGC man. Which means his head and brickwalls are friends
[1:46:56] <%jinking79> this is the best time right now
[1:46:57] <grayjammer> We're far less upset than we're pretending to be
[1:47:02] <Kghaleon> Liam just brute forced this section
[1:47:03] <RyuuAoi> Apologetic Woolie? NO. Woolie WILL figure it out!
[1:47:06] <generalve> I'm okay with this woolie it's a very Nice ASMR experience and calming
[1:47:07] <NDenizen> the [enemy stand] is still a secret
[1:47:13] <rad_dude123465> I don’t really blame Woolie for have trouble, this “boss” kinda sucks ass
[1:47:17] <KeiPrime> bongggg
[1:47:22] <+bubbli97> i wonder if woolie will figure out the last monkey
[1:47:24] <+doc_ock_rokc> @WoolieVersus If it gets long we weill just start singing Evanescence
[1:47:26] <%robobeau> It took me about an hour, because I didn't realize the gimmick that ONE monkey... You know the one...
[1:47:27] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:47:31] <laserbeaming> It's a pretty bad puzzle boss
[1:47:37] <+griffball13> does that bell even do anything?
[1:47:47] <MonstarGrrrl> !motivated
[1:47:47] <@Moobot> 403 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[1:47:48] <+G_Thunders> Headphones helped out a lot for this
[1:47:48] <+titans_ace_jerid> @Pookiedaexzile puzzles are an infinite combo loop until you work out the frame trap.
[1:47:55] <gunsrlove> eh, it isn't that bad
[1:47:55] <Dingo_Eejit> Ask not for who the puzzle fails, it fails for thee!
[1:47:58] <RyuuAoi> Get outta your head, @woolieversus.KICK ARSE!
[1:47:59] <shadow1man9> @griffball13 It does but saying what it is is spoilers
[1:48:02] <Dragon_Batman> I think if you get the hearing monkey there and ring it he'll be stunned
[1:48:03] <Kghaleon> There's nothing wrong with this boss, they give you plenty of tips and practically every room is important here.
[1:48:04] <+doc_ock_rokc> If you ring it at the right time you can deafen the monkey for a short time
[1:48:04] <NDenizen> if the hearing monkey stands above the bell when its rung, it gets stunned
[1:48:10] <+doc_ock_rokc> but the timeing is hard
[1:48:12] <+griffball13> @shadow1man9 ah ok got it
[1:48:13] <gunsrlove> you have hints and stuff for each monkey and it gets easier once you do the thing first
[1:48:30] <NDenizen> some of the rooms the monkeys will wonder into and then just get stuck there
[1:48:32] <limeyprick> every from game has to have that 1 weird boss fight
[1:48:35] <+starzo0> @robobeau i almost forgot about him
[1:48:36] <Coffee_JD> at least try running after it...
[1:48:38] <generalve> this boss design feels like Miyazaki kind of smelled his farts on this one
[1:48:45] <Dragon_Batman> I would hope Woolie remembers that that mmonkey is the hearing one
[1:48:58] <generalve> overly and unnecessarily complicated
[1:48:59] <%Lion_kun> woolie keeps trying to stealth them but ti's not really the way to do it
[1:49:10] <%Promessa_EX> wooliePOYO
[1:49:22] <NDenizen> its not really complicated, they even put notes in each room explaining what they do
[1:49:26] <%DedlokPM> wooliePOYO
[1:49:28] <CalderGaming> let him figure it out
[1:49:34] <artoflec> yeah this fight is just kind of boring and gimmicky lol
[1:49:38] <mankeyfigh> Ahhhhh this boss fight
[1:49:40] <+linSP> a hunter is a hunter even in a monkey dream
[1:49:42] <chronoxgp> no
[1:49:43] <+reiju_22> :O
[1:49:44] <Kghaleon> I tried stealthing the hearing monkey crouched with the sneaking pill, doesn't work at all.
[1:49:58] <hassanico> this boss fight is Demons SOuls as fuck
[1:49:59] <laserbeaming> damn, just when I unsub, woolie adds wooliePOYO. Well, maybe next month
[1:49:59] <+G_Thunders> It’s not boring if you finish it in 10-15 minutes like normal...
[1:50:01] <hassanico> !uptime
[1:50:01] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 50 minutes
[1:50:04] <mankeyfigh> How many attempts has he made?

[1:50:15] <+linSP> OOOJ
[1:50:18] <zamzoph> so close NotLikeThis
[1:50:19] <artoflec> if this was 2 minutes it'd be a boring 2 minutes
[1:50:21] <NDenizen> juked by a monkey
[1:50:29] <Kghaleon> I want Minh to just fall asleep
[1:50:31] <gunsrlove> more shuriken
[1:50:34] <RyuuAoi> Billy smoked a blunt before stream. LEGALLY.
[1:50:34] <Dingo_Eejit> Chill Bill
[1:50:35] <artoflec> i like this game but would never defend this part
[1:50:36] <%fatal_penguin_> Woolie, try to remember some of the basics of CQC
[1:50:41] <%jinking79> these monkeys r like my cousins
[1:50:47] <anniechans> damn, that’s closer than I ever got to green monkey without the bell
[1:50:51] <generalve> whomp whomp
[1:50:51] <RyuuAoi> @dingo_eejit Volume 2!
[1:50:53] <+linSP> them jukes
[1:50:55] <+starzo0> he might actually fall asleep, its happened before
[1:51:09] <duraju> endless cycle of woolie chasing monkeys
[1:51:14] <+stagemage> that monkey is laming it out just watching the timer. its a bit strange as woolie has the life lead
[1:51:19] <generalve> the monkeys are a bunch of bitch lasagnas
[1:51:19] <rad_dude123465> how do you feel about this boss on repeat play throughs? I think it’s alright on the first, but on repeats it feels like a huge slog
[1:51:20] <+Pookiedaexzile> Two Sessions Chat who wants the action
[1:51:25] <+Pookiedaexzile> I'm taking all bets
[1:51:27] <NDenizen> "snake, those are the folding screen monkeys. watch out!"
[1:51:39] <gunsrlove> its a one trick kinda deal , real atmospheric at first
[1:51:44] <laserbeaming> LUL
[1:51:45] <0rond> on the repeat playtrhough you can watch basically "solutions"
[1:51:46] <gunsrlove> but then it's not as fun
[1:51:50] <+griffball13> remember woolie this is a sneaking mission Kappa
[1:51:59] <%fatal_penguin_> Talk about the best steak sides, Woolie
[1:52:03] <%Promessa_EX> thinking outloud is useful
[1:52:08] <G0DKnight> What about whispering?
[1:52:09] <+starzo0> thinking out loud is great
[1:52:13] <gslayer14> legitimate tip:put the bell on the hotbar until you win the fight
[1:52:15] <BabyNaBackbrace> Woolie you caught up on Jojo yet?
[1:52:18] <kdallas_> just kill them 4Head
[1:52:25] <anniechans> whispering out loud

[2:20:02] <gigacanuck> you must destroy your iPhone to be free of the curse of Apple

[2:21:35] <DXLelouch24> Centipede Race War
[2:21:41] <Tisaric> it looks so fucking cool
[2:21:51] <%Solidnick18> it's so dope
[2:21:54] <+Pookiedaexzile> Minh is still hearing all those 3rd Birthday lyrics
[2:21:54] <+zanzibar_junker> Nah
[2:21:55] <%Solidnick18> no
[2:21:58] <EddieMayNot> Nope, it just costs too many spirit emblems.
[2:21:58] <Dragon_Batman> No that's just dramatic flair
[2:21:59] <+Pookiedaexzile> and by lyrics
[2:22:00] <%Promessa_EX> no that would be cool
[2:22:01] <gslayer14> thatd be sick but no
[2:22:01] <+Pookiedaexzile> I mean moans
[2:22:01] <0rond> would have been useful if ichimonji wasn't so broken
[2:22:03] <%Solidnick18> what
[2:22:07] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> It found you worthy now
[2:22:09] <castcode> it would be way more powerful if it took a node to just swing it lmao
[2:22:12] <%supersugoisenpai1> You died once for it, that's good enough
[2:22:13] <Graxe_> It kills you the first time.
[2:22:14] <Tisaric> that would've been a sick mechanic to explore
[2:22:16] <%wolfofsound> I thought he said erection not resurrection for a moment LUL
[2:22:16] <+InstiGaitan> shes the good kind of centipede
[2:22:21] <rasterman> That's how I thought it would work, but nope, spirit emblems
[2:22:23] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Okami Slash
[2:22:23] <+fatmanscreaming> lo
[2:22:28] <+conqab> it's just an attack, mang
[2:22:31] <BionicPulga> Haha.

[2:23:51] <+InstiGaitan> arf
[2:23:52] <artoflec> LUL
[2:23:52] <Kristoffers> arooo
[2:23:53] <BionicPulga> Good lord.

[2:23:55] <Ion_Laser> arf
[2:23:57] <worldbrand> the woolf
[2:23:57] <Eternal_Harmony> awoo
[2:23:57] <%supersugoisenpai1> Yif
[2:23:57] <+griffball13> never turn your back on the wolf pack
[2:24:01] <Mariakko> awoo
[2:24:04] <$Rezca> Can I get a stream with negative Arfing?
[2:24:05] <cheffailure> bork bork
[2:24:07] <+conqab> arf?
[2:24:08] <gustavozxd> oh god stop
[2:24:10] <+Pookiedaexzile> Tough Woolie barks
[2:24:14] <%robobeau> Woolie yiffing live on stream
[2:24:14] <+InstiGaitan> I am a wolf in all forms but physical
[2:24:15] <+InstiGaitan> arf
[2:24:15] <+fatmanscreaming> dmx?
[2:24:16] <castcode> apatJpeg apatJpeg apatJpeg
[2:24:19] <DXLelouch24> Woolie your barks are limp
[2:24:19] <%wolfofsound> FrankerZ
[2:24:23] <hassanico> bruh
[2:24:45] <+Pookiedaexzile> DMX always made me feel like each bark he did was a murder
[2:25:02] <castcode> DMX had the bark blast technique
[2:25:06] <+InstiGaitan> high monk > mortal blade
[2:25:11] <%Solidnick18> aye
[2:25:12] <Tisaric> Ichimonji is just a little bit OP
[2:25:13] <atin2000> @WoolieVersus it does pretty good damage, but you dont get the posture recovery
[2:25:22] <%Solidnick18> very slow
[2:25:23] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Centipede fight!
[2:25:23] <+Pookiedaexzile> WHIFF
[2:25:33] <+InstiGaitan> high monk > everything else
[2:25:37] <worldbrand> I kinda wish the blade were more consequential
[2:25:38] <EddieMayNot> @WoolieVersus Keep the double ichimonji. The Mortal Draw deals good damage, but no posture recovery, whereas the 2Ichi deals good damage and posture recovery.
[2:25:39] <Graxe_> Monks wanna keep her to themselves.
[2:25:43] <EddieMayNot> And it costs less.
[2:25:47] <Kghaleon> Pretty sure she's the one that talks to you when you first visit this zone
[2:25:47] <Graxe_> Lock her away
[2:25:57] <%Solidnick18> Oh
[2:26:08] <+Pookiedaexzile> 720
[2:26:17] <0rond> again with the jumping woolie plz
[2:26:23] <0rond> jump attacks do no damage
[2:26:26] <NeroInfinite> Mortis sweep
[2:26:27] <+Caped_Eggy> I do believe that the mortal draw damage through blocking, but not much
[2:26:27] <%Solidnick18> yee
[2:26:31] <+dawn_gacchi> wassup woolie
[2:26:47] <worldbrand> like if the mortal blade instead used a resurrection node every time it was drawn, that'd be pretty interesting
[2:26:56] <Dragon_Batman> That was a combo and a half, ouch
[2:27:06] <0rond> it would but it would have to be way stronger
[2:27:08] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Woolie gives up LUL
[2:27:27] <+fatmanscreaming> they dont die though
[2:27:27] <%Lion_kun> MONKEY ISLAND
[2:27:30] <%Lion_kun> MORE MONKEYS
[2:27:34] <+griffball13> @WoolieVersus go talk to your trainer at your base
[2:27:41] <%wolfofsound> LUBU
[2:27:47] <EddieMayNot> Lu-bu
[2:27:48] <NeroInfinite> lubebu
[2:27:48] <castcode> Do Not Pursue
[2:27:51] <EddieMayNot> Don't chase him
[2:27:52] <%Solidnick18> lube bu
[2:27:56] <Dragon_Batman> Do not pursue him
[2:28:01] <gigacanuck> wooloo is wululu
[2:28:01] <%Solidnick18> ;p
[2:28:06] <%DedlokPM> Yubu, Mebu, Webu, Lubu, Subu
[2:28:07] <%wolfofsound> actually in the new total war game you totally want to get him
[2:28:16] <DomunDomunDomun> we all bu for ice bu
[2:28:34] <laserbeaming> UwU
[2:28:34] <Make_me_mad> Fun Lu Bu facts: In real life he died like a punk.
[2:28:36] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> STRAAAAAY!
[2:28:38] <%wolfofsound> FUCK YEAH
[2:28:43] <+InstiGaitan> ookami AYAYA
[2:28:47] <%wolfofsound> Love that anime
[2:28:54] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Speaking of Okami, that brush stroke
[2:28:55] <+rdark_ksu> wolfs rain was fucking crazy cause it was all out of order when I saw it
[2:28:57] <+griffball13> that is a weird anime
[2:29:02] <$Rezca> Not enough guys in tight pants
[2:29:44] <%jinking79> you'll use it on One boss fight
[2:29:45] <%supersugoisenpai1> It's for big boy damage on bosses/mini-bosses
[2:29:48] <Dragon_Batman> I mean he is spending six
[2:29:50] <%wolfofsound> That scene when Toboe loses it on the giant walrus man
[2:29:50] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Woolie VS The Locals
[2:30:06] <+fatmanscreaming> i believe that move does go through blocks though
[2:30:11] <0rond> yup, as with all combat arts, "that's pretty cool, but ichimongi is better and free"
[2:30:16] <0rond> that's such a shame tbh
[2:30:16] <%Solidnick18> lol
[2:30:41] <%Solidnick18> i think they respawn
[2:30:42] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:30:53] <%Solidnick18> BASKET
[2:30:54] <Graxe_> Oh this guy
[2:30:57] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> What a basketcase Kappa

[2:31:22] <%Promessa_EX> wooliePOYO
[2:31:23] <Ion_Laser> Kappa
[2:31:26] <alexandrecau> you're a shinobi wolf
[2:31:33] <Graxe_> I can see this guy becoming a Stand user with a shitty Stand
[2:31:52] <Dragon_Batman> Some dood who didn't kill him immediately is my guess
[2:31:58] <%wolfofsound> @Graxe_ He'd be super powerful in One Piece with the basket basket fruit
[2:32:01] <alexandrecau> Are you not gonna kill me= honorable
[2:32:05] <zamzoph> I'm normal! It's everyone ELSE who's crazy!
[2:32:13] <%Promessa_EX> sounds like water
[2:32:49] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Everyone wants that palace juice
[2:32:50] <Graxe_> Drink the water
[2:32:54] <+fatmanscreaming> yep
[2:32:55] <+griffball13> they drank the koolaid
[2:33:06] <Graxe_> It's very special water
[2:33:09] <+linSP> WOOLAID
[2:33:13] <$Rezca> Do not drink water from places with bad public utlities
[2:33:24] <+hypemaster19> the water's fine
[2:33:44] <gigacanuck> but check out that Inuhiko guy, he sounds cool
[2:33:55] <NeroInfinite> Or don't drink water form places with giant chickens
[2:34:09] <gigacanuck> but I want to be giant like giant chickens
[2:34:56] <Graxe_> The fun thing about the puppeteer ninjutsu is that you can reapply it if you have the emblems to do it again.
[2:35:00] <castcode> They were all just waiting dang
[2:35:12] <Djinnazz> Got your bell rung.
[2:35:15] <gigacanuck> so about that fire arm

[2:40:50] <Kghaleon> Here comes punished Woolie
[2:41:00] <ChildishUzumaki> ¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿
[2:41:08] <+Tugs_Keng> come on man shadows can only die twice
[2:41:10] <+EndgameContent> In a single fight, you can only come back once unless you get a deathblow mid-fight (like against bosses)
[2:41:10] <NeoRageX456> yeah, what he said Kappa
[2:41:17] <gigacanuck> no stamina damage to this guy
[2:41:18] <+zanzibar_junker> Hide Presence would give a free kill
[2:41:33] <+EndgameContent> So even if you have 3 dots, you can only use one of 'em against this guy.
[2:41:42] <gslayer14> way of the stinky fist
[2:41:46] <Ragnorok64> can that merchant die?
[2:41:49] <+griffball13> se the black bar

[2:41:54] <turf_wind_and_fire> @gslayer14 didn't Krillin beat that guy?
[2:41:59] <ChildishUzumaki> @zanzibar_junker But would that hide Woolie's stench?
[2:42:05] <Dragon_Batman> Man Woolie is rusty
[2:42:11] <Kghaleon> Purple dude is Daigo
[2:42:19] <Admiral_PopnFresh> This monk is no joke

[2:43:20] <BionicPulga> I can feel the panic.
[2:43:21] <gslayer14> i never tried

[2:54:50] <+Midnight_Fondler> Is that the mythical soup collecting hoodie?
[2:55:03] <+pkmamsters> Nao-chan best female member. She WILL speak her mind.
[2:55:04] <meermadon> Oh I always thought that was just Matt being stupid
[2:55:11] <turf_wind_and_fire> @meermadon ditto
[2:55:18] <+rdark_ksu> Terrace House would be funny if they just put them in some state. LIke Illinois or Arkansas and they just confused
[2:55:21] <BabyNaBackbrace> I call it Soup Hoodie because it looks like soup, I wanna throw croutons at it
[2:55:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> your death is what it is
[2:55:27] <Dragon_Batman> I didn't realize that until they talked about it on the podcast back when the 3 were doing it
[2:55:36] <brambobelurkin> Oh hes here
[2:55:38] <Graxe_> Oh yeah, the man-eating fish
[2:55:39] <brambobelurkin> noice

[2:56:04] <+pkmamsters> Arman's the best
[2:56:11] <worldbrand> they're pushing the biracials
[2:56:11] <zamzoph> @WoolieVersus I saw Heart Signal from the Twitch K-Drama marathon, which was quite amusing. The doctor was alpha that all the girls wanted, which made it tough for the stage actor and the race car driver
[2:56:20] <%robobeau> Goddamn, those half Japanese girls... do it to me every time...
[2:56:26] <+cvp5127> so exotic PogChamp
[2:56:27] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Ah yes, the biracials
[2:56:45] <+griffball13> Ugly biracials filth
[2:56:54] <+griffball13> so the fe says
[2:56:56] <zamzoph> the bi part is very important. Can't be _too_ foreign
[2:57:09] <%robobeau> Real talk, what's contact medicine for...?
[2:57:11] <Dragon_Batman> Hah
[2:57:19] <+pkmamsters> Wait till you get to Aloha State and meet Wes.
[2:57:28] <%CaptainPileDriver> can you explain the dishes weren't done arc
[2:57:28] <Graxe_> If you combine contact medicine with mist raven, you can basically teleport constantly until the poison goes away.
[2:57:33] <zamzoph> MONEY
[2:57:41] <cheffailure> @robobeau For forgetting about poison damage, and teleporting with the Mist Raven at will.
[2:57:41] <+Bigdrifter210> MOTIVATED
[2:57:49] <%Solidnick18> yes
[2:57:51] <Graxe_> Contact medicine inflicts you with a really weak poison.
[2:57:52] <alexandrecau> @WoolieVersus what reality tv show pick uggos?

[3:12:52] <brambobelurkin> I found Snake eyes to be different but not hard. you can get the stealth hit on them
[3:12:55] <+EndgameContent> Maybe Woolie Should Try Exploring Past This Area Without Fighting Her
[3:13:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> LOL, hoes don't be crying in woolie's neighborhood
[3:13:08] <+cvp5127> yoooo shinkenger
[3:13:09] <+OctopusLantern> yo shinkenger is great
[3:13:10] <cheffailure> Goomba stomp, boyo.
[3:13:20] <rad_dude123465> Those episodes of samurai champloo were the shit
[3:13:22] <+AngriestAngryArtist> ABARE :P
[3:13:28] <zamzoph> it's like this is an archetype or something
[3:13:29] <chronoxgp> i feel like that's a trope
[3:13:29] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ???
[3:13:30] <+InstiGaitan> stio jumping back bruh
[3:13:34] <+griffball13> her life bar is right there
[3:13:35] <+MagickBurritoh> what
[3:13:36] <gslayer14> ?
[3:13:36] <worldbrand> ????
[3:13:36] <$Rezca> fire in the sky?
[3:13:39] <natebud> Yep, no life bar nowhere
[3:13:40] <kalinflip> The senpou skill tree has my favorite sweep counter in the game
[3:13:40] <%Solidnick18> yes
[3:13:40] <fallacy8> what
[3:13:42] <NeoRageX456> woolie has crazy talk as well?
[3:13:47] <+Dorf1> what did he mean by this
[3:13:51] <Raldavar> everyone knows Woolie is blind.
[3:13:55] <BionicPulga> Lol
[3:13:55] <Dragon_Batman> True the snake eyes get a free stealth if you get it but I found their moves more tough to figure out, until I got the umbrella at least
[3:13:58] <+InstiGaitan> wheres the lifebar
[3:13:59] <castcode> @brambobelurkin ya this was the fight where the game for me was 'learn to parry' and I just had to stop being mad and pay attention to the tells
[3:14:02] <+Tearonex> "Has no lifebar"
[3:14:18] <fallacy8> oh its a death bar
[3:14:18] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:14:18] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> Yandere Ghost Waifu's <3
[3:14:22] <zamzoph> LUL
[3:14:22] <+InstiGaitan> thats not her lifebar thats youre lifebar
[3:14:25] <chronoxgp> isn't that what happens in lady butterfly, the absent father comes home with a new wife so she has a break down
[3:14:25] <natebud> Leave a bootprint on that ghost's face
[3:14:32] <fallacy8> cause its a ghost
[3:14:36] <NocturnalRites> She might as well have no life bar its way easier to posture break her in my opinion
[3:14:38] <%Solidnick18> that's a one shot
[3:14:44] <+Codex5050> TO ALL: crazy talk is NOT the same as being wrong! Crazy Talk is Pat's stand where he says something SUPER wrong, and it becomes TRUE later!
[3:15:02] <+cvp5127> billy whats your favorite sentai?
[3:15:03] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> Leave a hand print on that ghosts ass.
[3:15:04] <worldbrand> you beat me to the punch, but yeah
[3:15:08] <+EndgameContent> Isn't that Crazy Talk Requiem?
[3:15:10] <+Codex5050> deep lore for you
[3:15:14] <%Solidnick18> posture break her
[3:15:33] <+TopTieramisu> this fight is so cool
[3:15:36] <brambobelurkin> @castcode First Boss I really parried to death was the Giraffe boys. Then Lil Yao followed by the Big Yao
[3:15:38] <BabyNaBackbrace> Codex is being crazy talked
[3:15:53] <%CaptainPileDriver> nah, crazy talk requiem is a stand that infects others and when they say something super wrong about something trivial it becomes true
[3:16:06] <+EndgameContent> Thought Crazy Talk was Pat saying something and reality bending out of the way to spite him
[3:16:26] <worldbrand> crazy talk is pat saying something and then reality bending to make him wrong, requiem is when he says something absurd that becomes true like GRRM mentioning locking him in a cabin
[3:16:30] <BabyNaBackbrace> Crazy Talk Requiem, aka UNSANE
[3:16:38] <Raldavar> crazy talk's normal ability is to alter space-time to randomly make what Pat says wrong with no discernible pattern
[3:16:50] <%Solidnick18> christ
[3:16:55] <%CaptainPileDriver> @worldbrand that man is 100% correct, that is crazy talk requiem
[3:16:56] <+EndgameContent> Yeah, that makes a bit more sense
[3:17:11] <+griffball13> magic pixel
[3:17:15] <%supersugoisenpai1> Get aggresive
[3:17:20] <duraju> F
[3:17:23] <%Solidnick18> lol
[3:17:24] <%Aussie_Manny> BigPhish
[3:17:25] <BionicPulga> Lol
[3:17:26] <chronoxgp> woolie thinking too much
[3:17:30] <+Codex5050> as long as the misinformation is stemmed I am here for it! thank for you for the corrections!
[3:17:33] <castcode> @brambobelurkin I wish I really ran into those two sooner because O'Rin just phasing around was throwing me off as well.
[3:17:38] <+TopTieramisu> hesitation is defeat
[3:17:47] <NocturnalRites> yeah it looked like he panickedf a bit
[3:17:49] <%robobeau> Yeah you really gotta go in on this boss
[3:17:50] <+InstiGaitan> was about to say that @TopTieramisu
[3:17:55] <%CaptainPileDriver> BE, AGGRESSIVE, B, E, AGGRESSIVE
[3:17:56] <%robobeau> Confetti helps
[3:17:58] <chronoxgp> i see woolie trying to learn a 3rd strike, when no boss in this game lets you do that
[3:18:02] <%Solidnick18> YES
[3:18:03] <zamzoph> all that for one bar LUL
[3:18:16] <castcode> here we go
[3:18:20] <%Aussie_Manny> BigPhish
[3:18:20] <duraju> all that for a drop of bar
[3:18:23] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> confetti is useful if u have any
[3:18:28] <brambobelurkin> @castcode I didnt realize it at first, but I started at Senpou and went backwards I guess lol. Most people I saw hit this way and Monkey trouble first.
[3:18:31] <NocturnalRites> Her speed makes being too agressive a bad idea
[3:18:39] <fallacy8> crackers
[3:18:39] <Patzzki217> use sabimaru if you want cheese
[3:18:48] <fallacy8> n spirit juice
[3:18:51] <+InstiGaitan> honestly sugar is more useful
[3:18:56] <cheffailure> Walk away.
[3:19:04] <OkamiDude15> i cheesed her on the geometry but even that is pretty hard
[3:19:05] <%Aussie_Manny> NOTICE ME, SENPAI!
[3:19:10] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> Hoes Mad x24
[3:19:12] <+InstiGaitan> WHAT
[3:19:12] <+TopTieramisu> top yandere
[3:19:12] <%robobeau> IT'S NOT LIKE I WANTED YOU TO NOTICE ME B-BAKA
[3:19:13] <BabyNaBackbrace> That scared the shit out of me the first time
[3:19:19] <chronoxgp> gasai yuno
[3:19:28] <worldbrand> You can technically just run away
[3:19:29] <+InstiGaitan> THAT NEVER HAPPENED TO ME
[3:19:38] <Raldavar> daily reminder that Sekiro has no stamina bar, meaning you can keep swinging and run like a scrub forever
[3:19:46] <brambobelurkin> ^
[3:19:47] <DXLelouch24> but if you run away all of chat will call you a Coward
[3:19:52] <NocturnalRites> I mean you can sneak around by swimming near the bridge and grappling up
[3:20:03] <chronoxgp> even if you do get staggered you can just roll
[3:20:08] <cheffailure> Woolie, she's actually a health boss pretending to be a posture boss.
[3:20:17] <worldbrand> yeah but ghosts are scarier than human judgement so i wouldnt mind being a coward in that situation
[3:20:27] <+TopTieramisu> @cheffailure i disagree
[3:20:35] <natebud> I remember being able to get one free swipe in when she does the jump
[3:20:38] <+TopTieramisu> you have to land the consecutive deflections
[3:20:39] <NocturnalRites> Blocking when you get staggered is the safer option
[3:20:47] <worldbrand> on my first playthrough she was a health boss, on my second playthrough she was a posture boss
[3:20:48] <OkamiDude15> all that smack talk about ghosts are catching up to woolie
[3:21:00] <cheffailure> The problem is her posture regen is too fast at this NG.
[3:21:06] <duraju> gHosTs aRe JusT cHEMICals
[3:21:18] <zamzoph> She'll chase you to the ends of the earth!
[3:21:19] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:21:20] <+cvp5127> yandere Kreygasm
[3:21:28] <gslayer14> yanyan?
[3:21:35] <gslayer14> is that how that works
[3:21:51] <OkamiDude15> everyones gangsta till she actually straight up murders you
[3:21:53] <NocturnalRites> If you have deflect timing down her posture regen isnt a problem
[3:22:01] <+InstiGaitan> You uaed to be able to backstab her by jumping on her from behind but idk if that works anymore
[3:22:04] <Bakafied> I really like her moveset and title, they go really well together.
[3:22:16] <cheffailure> Not anymore. They realized the cheese.
[3:22:17] <GoldeNOVA> Is there no arm that is good against her?
[3:22:20] <worldbrand> i know it's an incredibly bad habit, but i found jumping to be really effective against her
[3:22:30] <cheffailure> She's an okami relative. Probably.
[3:22:37] <+mobius_won> I had to cheese this bitch in my first playthrough
[3:22:39] <agentsap2006> I like how in Sekiro everyone just has a katana to pull on each other
[3:22:47] <benjiFG> yanyan
[3:22:49] <Raldavar> did they ever nerf fireworks?
[3:22:55] <cheffailure> Probably not.
[3:22:59] <GoldeNOVA> The problem is that Woolie jumps back, so he gets out of range
[3:23:09] <NocturnalRites> This game is a lot like DS1 if you can parry you are golden
[3:23:16] <worldbrand> yeah now that you mention it, it's really interesting how she's lit from below
[3:23:20] <thejolliestsunbro> oh shiiiiiiiit Woolie's playing Sekiro? I just finished re-watching their DS1 LP
[3:23:30] <zamzoph> just like genichiro
[3:23:36] <worldbrand> y... yeah... just like real life
[3:23:52] <GoldeNOVA> You're fighting a dude and he pulls out a Pepsi
[3:23:54] <NocturnalRites> Genichiro is a bitch if oyu have deflect and jump timing down
[3:23:58] <HawaiiAnthony> just like in vietnam
[3:23:58] <BionicPulga> I cheese this fight so hard.
[3:24:00] <OkamiDude15> mihn's secret underground tournament fights
[3:24:03] <Tisaric> she almostr looks like a luigi's mansion ghost with the way she'ls lit
[3:24:03] <+InstiGaitan> you'vee never healed yourself in battle in real life?
[3:24:06] <cheffailure> Neutral jump, baby.
[3:24:13] <thejolliestsunbro> Sekiro but there's summons
[3:24:26] <+zanzibar_junker> I honesty use axe more than ichimonji
[3:24:28] <NocturnalRites> Woolies got bad nooch
[3:24:34] <NeoRageX456> woolie just let that left stick alone and parry/jump kick
[3:24:34] <worldbrand> imagine being brave enough to ichimonji a ghost
[3:24:40] <BionicPulga> Lol
[3:24:40] <duraju> i think woolie is tired
[3:24:44] <rad_dude123465> Gotta step up that NOOCH
[3:24:54] <+griffball13> divine confettie does bonus damage right?
[3:24:58] <worldbrand> yep
[3:25:00] <cheffailure> She's a keeper. As in she's gonna keep you occupied.
[3:25:00] <TheyCallMeVawn> Theres some good cheese strats against her
[3:25:03] <+TopTieramisu> i'd say it's more his defense and punish game that are not up to snuff
[3:25:14] <Dragon_Batman> He just isn't getting the parries, now he is though
[3:25:15] <+zanzibar_junker> Save da confetti
[3:25:18] <NocturnalRites> well that and his inability to neutral jump
[3:25:25] <OkamiDude15> never stop going in
[3:25:27] <+InstiGaitan> sugars more helpful cause deflects
[3:25:28] <%Promessa_EX> I would guess she goes down like everything else if you rush aggressively
[3:25:28] <natebud> You get do one free hit on that jump.
[3:25:31] <cheffailure> Absolute disrespect.
[3:25:31] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Is wooolie going for for a kill everything run?
[3:25:37] <gslayer14> wake up supers
[3:25:48] <BabyNaBackbrace> When I finally learned her "reads" I took her out almost without realizing I beat her
[3:25:58] <+zanzibar_junker> Jump on her
[3:26:05] <worldbrand> let's just nonstop dragon rush and hope nothing goes wrong
[3:26:11] <gslayer14> sabby bois
[3:26:15] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Minh's attempts at niche humor
[3:26:16] <thejolliestsunbro> O'rin was brutal for me too but it may be because I'm trash lol
[3:26:23] <zamzoph> poisoning a ghost LUL
[3:26:31] <GoldeNOVA> You see Bison charge his Psycho Crusher and doesn't do anything
[3:26:36] <+TopTieramisu> can you poison a ghost? 🤔
[3:26:39] <cheffailure> Congrats Woolie, you found it.
[3:26:39] <Patzzki217> sabimaru is good
[3:26:41] <gslayer14> PISS OFF GHOST
[3:26:44] <OkamiDude15> guess so
[3:26:45] <duraju> i used the chemicals to destroy the chemicals
[3:26:53] <+griffball13> bitch ass ghosts
[3:27:08] <cheffailure> Expensive though.
[3:27:09] <+TopTieramisu> let's goooo
[3:27:11] <gslayer14> its s shame poison doesnt last on her
[3:27:11] <worldbrand> holy shit he did it
[3:27:19] <duraju> sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye
[3:27:21] <thejolliestsunbro> poison affects ghosts because poison is just emotional draining
[3:27:26] <ashuckel> sekiro rewards you towards being super aggressive and just defending at the right times
[3:27:27] <+TopTieramisu> oh damn, now he has to play honestly
[3:27:28] <cheffailure> Tanto, unfortunately.
[3:27:28] <OkamiDude15> friendship ended with fireworks now sabimaru is woolie's new best friend
[3:27:29] <BabyNaBackbrace> Sabimaru's my JAM
[3:27:31] <natebud> Now do it legit
[3:27:34] <+griffball13> no
[3:27:35] <Ragnorok64> I had no idea that worked??!
[3:27:39] <GoldeNOVA> Do those rekkas
[3:27:41] <cheffailure> Ceremonial Tanto
[3:27:41] <worldbrand> ceremonial tanto
[3:27:44] <zamzoph> CONFETTI
[3:27:44] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Is sabimaru that wakizashi?
[3:27:48] <+TopTieramisu> he's all out of meter
[3:27:50] <Patzzki217> the knife
[3:28:00] <+griffball13> confettie will help
[3:28:01] <worldbrand> i never found it worth it
[3:28:04] <NocturnalRites> You gotta fight a Shichimen to get it and those guys are assholes
[3:28:06] <cheffailure> Bonus damage
[3:28:08] <%supersugoisenpai1> Use some sugar
[3:28:08] <+TopTieramisu> she a ghost
[3:28:10] <+zanzibar_junker> Nnnnnnooooo
[3:28:10] <Djinnazz> she's dead.
[3:28:11] <+InstiGaitan> AKOS SUGAR
[3:28:12] <worldbrand> It's divine confetti, man
[3:28:15] <duraju> dont use the confetti
[3:28:15] <+InstiGaitan> NOT CONFETTI
[3:28:15] <zamzoph> Woolie forgot BrokeBack
[3:28:16] <cheffailure> Better to use sugar though.
[3:28:17] <BionicPulga> Maybe you should save the Sabimaru for the second phase.
[3:28:18] <+zanzibar_junker> Nnnnooo
[3:28:19] <BabyNaBackbrace> ooooOOoohh
[3:28:20] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[3:28:20] <duraju> NOOOOO
[3:28:21] <+InstiGaitan> AKOS SUGAR
[3:28:24] <+InstiGaitan> NOOOOOO
[3:28:26] <NocturnalRites> Posture sugar is more helpful
[3:28:33] <Dragon_Batman> You don't really need to
[3:28:35] <chronoxgp> she's not that hard jeez
[3:28:40] <worldbrand> Don't use all of it, but
[3:28:41] <NeoRageX456> he has 16 in store may as well use a couple for shits and gigs
[3:28:45] <OkamiDude15> she aint gonna let tou get the chance
[3:28:48] <natebud> I didn't waste confetti here.
[3:28:49] <thejolliestsunbro> oof
[3:28:50] <duraju> F
[3:28:52] <gslayer14> now perish
[3:29:01] <Dragon_Batman> Fair enough
[3:29:09] <+JingKaisean> use poison
[3:29:11] <thejolliestsunbro> i think she's tough send tweet
[3:29:19] <BionicPulga> Haha.
[3:29:19] <+JingKaisean> works better than confetti
[3:29:24] <+InstiGaitan> who said use confetti
[3:29:27] <+Sabre_Basilisk> But do combo tho
[3:29:31] <BabyNaBackbrace> I want Sekiro in Soul Calibur
[3:29:31] <NocturnalRites> that back jumping is not helping him at all but hey hes getting the fight down
[3:29:37] <+TopTieramisu> F
[3:29:38] <zamzoph> F
[3:29:41] <worldbrand> he did use poison but he ran outta emblems
[3:29:42] <natebud> You get ONE free hit on that jump
[3:29:44] <duraju> dont use it tho
[3:29:49] <+InstiGaitan> USE AKOS SUGAR
[3:29:50] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay
[3:29:50] <Dapper_Cactuar> everyone I know hates this fight with a fiery passion
[3:29:51] <NeoRageX456> confetti does more damage in general
[3:29:51] <transporterthesequel> Wollie the second she stops attacking GO IN
[3:29:53] <chronoxgp> she doesn't do that many attacks between steps
[3:29:53] <duraju> use sugar
[3:29:53] <+zanzibar_junker> Chat you fucks
[3:29:57] <gustavozxd> more power?
[3:29:58] <The_Blumper> hello
[3:30:02] <gustavozxd> !motivated
[3:30:02] <@Moobot> 405 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[3:30:03] <worldbrand> this fight gave me trouble, but i really like it
[3:30:06] <%Promessa_EX> use neutral jumps instead of jumping back
[3:30:08] <Graxe_> @WoolieVersus It is possible to get a deathblow her before the fight starts. Just jump on her head. Seriously.
[3:30:11] <+TopTieramisu> some people never figured out how this fight works
[3:30:13] <%robobeau> You can throw a rock at her before the fight to get in a backstab
[3:30:13] <thejolliestsunbro> I need a koopy sandwich tbh
[3:30:17] <NocturnalRites> Posture would help more against her since she does so much damn posture damage
[3:30:21] <%robobeau> But the timing is TIGHT
[3:30:23] <+InstiGaitan> if you dont hit her there isnt a point in using confetti you deflect so use sugar
[3:30:23] <cheffailure> @Graxe_ Been patched out.
[3:30:26] <+JingKaisean> scum out the first deathblow
[3:30:31] <BionicPulga> I cheesed it too.
[3:30:38] <Graxe_> Oh, that's too bad.
[3:30:41] <BionicPulga> Screw the style points, lol.
[3:30:43] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Man Shin-Hisako got buffed
[3:30:46] <gslayer14> thats some nice posture damage
[3:30:48] <+SchmeatBoy> cheese ResidentSleeper
[3:30:51] <alexandrecau> poison the ghost
[3:30:52] <NeoRageX456> just parry, jump counter the sweeps and attack just enough to not let her recover posture
[3:30:56] <Graxe_> Sabimaru is her actual weakness, though. So nice that Woolie found that out.
[3:30:58] <+TopTieramisu> ouch
[3:31:01] <%rockguitarfan> rockguitarfan subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[3:31:03] <zamzoph> just posture her out
[3:31:09] <+Sabre_Basilisk> woolie vs game mechanics
[3:31:14] <+TopTieramisu> wall pressure
[3:31:19] <rad_dude123465> Get doinked
[3:31:21] <Dragon_Batman> Ooof that corner pressur
[3:31:27] <duraju> just beat every enemy perfectly everytime
[3:31:29] <NocturnalRites> Like someone said earlier she is a health boss not a posture boss
[3:31:30] <natebud> I think the only time healing is safe is when she does that back jump.
[3:31:40] <BionicPulga> Lol
[3:31:44] <Admiral_PopnFresh> wow Minh, savage
[3:31:45] <+InstiGaitan> she's totally not a health boss
[3:31:49] <cheffailure> Neutral jump baby
[3:31:50] <alexandrecau> finally woolie will be hokage
[3:31:54] <+InstiGaitan> she attacks too much to be a health boss
[3:32:01] <NeoRageX456> actually woolie, stand against a wall that way you can't jump backwards anymore LUL
[3:32:15] <+InstiGaitan> you deflect her flurry shes at like 40% posture
[3:32:31] <zamzoph> every time NotLikeThis
[3:32:33] <BionicPulga> @NeoRageX456 LUL
[3:32:34] <worldbrand> you can pretty easily bait her into using it, too
[3:32:40] <%Promessa_EX> one better, maybe jump forward
[3:32:47] <gslayer14> does woolie know that feathering parry reduces it's active frames?
[3:32:49] <yamikami13> well hello fellow citizen of the interweb. how are you all doing on this fine evening
[3:32:51] <worldbrand> yeaaaah
[3:32:55] <+Sabre_Basilisk> yeyeyeye
[3:32:57] <NocturnalRites> yeah which means its easier to go for posture getting her health pool to drop is more difficult
[3:33:00] <+TopTieramisu> i love that death blow
[3:33:09] <+TopTieramisu> that and the mikiri death blow
[3:33:10] <BabyNaBackbrace> Now it's time for the SABI STABBY
[3:33:32] <+Sabre_Basilisk> that was close
[3:33:50] <Admiral_PopnFresh> nice off the wall attack, Vega
[3:33:52] <BionicPulga> Let's go!
[3:33:54] <worldbrand> YEAAAH
[3:33:54] <+TopTieramisu> LET'S GO
[3:33:55] <+Sabre_Basilisk> yyyyyeeeeaaa

[3:35:46] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Hes lived a hard life
[3:35:59] <natebud> You did also get prayer beads and healing deathblows at least.
[3:36:01] <BionicPulga> I used the Jizo statues in the last fight.
[3:36:01] <BabyNaBackbrace> Jizos help in a very specific situation
[3:36:03] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Hes earned his rest
[3:36:04] <cheffailure> Found your waifu.
[3:36:06] <%galaxyswirl> i want to believe that ghost was his mama
[3:36:08] <cheffailure> You got beads
[3:36:15] <+InstiGaitan> If you dont die and you rest they're useless
[3:36:21] <+SchmeatBoy> have a second jizo helped me through the last boss
[3:36:28] <NocturnalRites> but they are only really good for boss runs when you dont feel like farming out a res

[3:43:31] <+TopTieramisu> you never encounter the man o-rin was pining for
[3:43:42] <cheffailure> Sakuza never shows up in-game
[3:44:02] <natebud> I don't think he's even mentioned again
[3:44:03] <cheffailure> Welcome to the showdown.
[3:44:08] <BionicPulga> Aw yiss.

[3:44:58] <+TopTieramisu> she thicc
[3:45:01] <+griffball13> now is the time to get good
[3:45:02] <+EndgameContent> I think it might be good for Woolie to know that she is not a ghost
[3:45:04] <Graxe_> But only gotta land that one deathblow, though
[3:45:06] <DXLelouch24> Woolie your not gonna poison a ghost cmon now
[3:45:10] <natebud> Jump right into the downward swing
[3:45:11] <+nekodelic> his posture is high, so you need to blaze a lot to get higher
[3:45:19] <+TopTieramisu> his?
[3:45:32] <DXLelouch24> corrupted monks a chikc dude
[3:45:36] <DXLelouch24> chick*
[3:45:53] <+EndgameContent> She's having nun of that
[3:45:54] <natebud> Lady does have a pretty deep voice
[3:45:54] <+TopTieramisu> now this is a health boss
[3:45:56] <%DashXero> DashXero subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! Finally catching one of these streams.
[3:46:07] <FALCONxPAWNCH> please do not misgender corrupted monk
[3:46:10] <duraju> does poison work here?
[3:46:13] <shadow1man9> No
[3:46:16] <cheffailure> Doubt it.
[3:46:18] <+zanzibar_junker> Nah
[3:46:19] <+TopTieramisu> she got autoguard
[3:46:20] <+EndgameContent> Woolie doesn't have a prayer in this first run
[3:46:22] <%galaxyswirl> not HERE
[3:46:23] <+TopTieramisu> like kyo kusanagi
[3:46:32] <+InstiGaitan> corrupted monks real name is priestess yao
[3:46:38] <Ragnorok64> is this even doable without confetti?
[3:46:43] <%galaxyswirl> yes
[3:46:45] <cheffailure> Monk means business!
[3:46:45] <Graxe_> O'Rin was a special case where she was actually weak to poison.
[3:46:46] <duraju> ye
[3:46:49] <shadow1man9> Yes
[3:46:50] <+TopTieramisu> @Ragnorok64 ye
[3:46:51] <gslayer14> until he figures out the gimmick he's got no chance
[3:46:51] <%galaxyswirl> every fight is
[3:46:52] <sjotyme86> she's a human end of story
[3:46:55] <NocturnalRites> just gotta git gud and deflect it all
[3:46:55] <Dragon_Batman> Yea it is super doable without confetti
[3:46:59] <+lastjudge07> Woolie is looking buff as hell
[3:47:01] <+TopTieramisu> confetti is never mandatory
[3:47:08] <BionicPulga> That was brave.
[3:47:13] <+Sabre_Basilisk> i hear ghots dont like fire or loud noises
[3:47:17] <+InstiGaitan> you can do this fight without in 1 hit
[3:47:32] <+InstiGaitan> you can do this fight in 1 hit*
[3:47:41] <shadow1man9> @InstiGaitan They removed that glitch I believe
[3:47:46] <+InstiGaitan> No way
[3:47:46] <%robobeau> I've done this fight without confetti, just footsies
[3:47:51] <+zanzibar_junker> Run and gun wait for big moves
[3:47:57] <+hypemaster19> confetti is good
[3:47:58] <%robobeau> Exactly, run and gun
[3:48:05] <NocturnalRites> Yup they removed the glitch to one shot the monk
[3:48:11] <chronoxgp> confetti is for corpses
[3:48:26] <+InstiGaitan> No way dude
[3:48:39] <Dragon_Batman> Yea figuring out her attacks is the major key.
[3:49:01] <NeoRageX456> confetti is for apparitions or whatever, this one is an illusion
[3:49:09] <+TopTieramisu> just fight her head on. it's a fun fight
[3:49:17] <%robobeau> *She
[3:49:22] <cheffailure> Firecrackers work on everyone.
[3:49:28] <+nekodelic> IT'S MA'AM
[3:49:33] <+Sabre_Basilisk> good combo interrupt right there
[3:49:34] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[3:49:34] <%fatal_penguin_> Ghosts>Chinese Propellant
[3:49:53] <zamzoph> cheese strats
[3:49:56] <+Sabre_Basilisk> Is this an enemy stand?
[3:49:59] <+EndgameContent> She's got the nun outfit and everything
[3:50:15] <%DashXero> I'm still not sure where greed factors into this game's combat.
[3:50:29] <cheffailure> That swing has some bizarre hitbox stuff going on. It might even require double-tapping if you're too close.
[3:50:32] <%robobeau> Dodge that jumping overhead and heavy attack
[3:50:32] <natebud> When she does those five big spins, the last one is slightly early just to throw you off.
[3:50:33] <+EndgameContent> It's not about greed, it's about aggression
[3:50:47] <+TopTieramisu> woolie's doing very well
[3:50:49] <+EndgameContent> It's applying constant pressure when it's prudent
[3:50:52] <NocturnalRites> I wonder if Woolie has any snap seeds
[3:51:24] <%robobeau> Oh hey, I wonder if you can jump over those rotating sweeps
[3:51:34] <Dragon_Batman> Ooooh yea snap seeds are a decent bit of help here
[3:51:57] <FALCONxPAWNCH> Ashes work too
[3:52:05] <%robobeau> Wut how are snap seeds good here...?
[3:52:09] <BionicPulga> Woolie's close.
[3:52:10] <NocturnalRites> shame that mikiri would have gotten close
[3:52:11] <cheffailure> I love baiting for that swing.
[3:52:22] <NeoRageX456> this is an illusion, snap seeds stun her
[3:52:26] <%robobeau> WHAT
[3:52:28] <Dragon_Batman> She technically is an illusion and snap seeds hurt her
[3:52:30] <%robobeau> I never knew
[3:52:32] <+RebelzPlague> yep
[3:52:33] <NeoRageX456> only 3 times
[3:52:36] <NocturnalRites> hey also do damage
[3:52:39] <+TopTieramisu> snap seeds do a buttload of damage
[3:52:40] <%robobeau> I mean, it makes sense given what comes later
[3:52:40] <+Sabre_Basilisk> iirc if you can beat this boss using items and its a cake walk
[3:52:47] <cheffailure> Will take her health down to almost health after three uses.
[3:52:51] <+TopTieramisu> let's gooooo

[3:52:59] <+Sabre_Basilisk> better than pat
[3:53:01] <Nyckelus> People cheese the crap out of this boss with snap seeds and firecrackers.
[3:53:01] <Graxe_> Look at that white ghost blood
[3:53:06] <%robobeau> Man, wish I knew about Snap Seeds
[3:53:07] <Dragon_Batman> Good stuff Woolz, missed that Mikir counter tho

[3:53:47] <NeoRageX456> nah, he jumped backwards to victory
[3:53:48] <%robobeau> You can now encounter awful awful things underwater
[3:53:48] <Dragon_Batman> He doesn't have the whistle either
[3:53:51] <OkamiDude15> master your hamon breathing to fight kiryu
[3:53:58] <+MagiKestral> wait is this woolie's last kuro item

[3:55:17] <%supersugoisenpai1> 6 times stronger than you started
[3:55:27] <@Menitta> oh no
[3:55:33] <%robobeau> @OkamiDude15 I was kidding, but I realize now that could ACTUALLY be interpreted as an ACTUAL boss lol
[3:55:34] <+hypemaster19> coping
[3:55:42] <DXLelouch24> 6 of i think 20 attack
[3:55:47] <DXLelouch24> or 10

[3:55:56] <+nekodelic> mind goblins
[3:55:58] <Raldavar> remember when you start an rpg doing 3 damage at level 1 and somehow start doing hundreds at level 5?

[3:56:05] <+InstiGaitan> praying strikes is sick
[3:56:14] <OkamiDude15> what are woolie's mind goblins?
[3:56:20] <Revant_tillywink> very cool

[3:56:38] <NocturnalRites> Senpo gets high monk which destroys sweep bosses
[3:56:39] <Dragon_Batman> Most enemies don't usually get to counter attack when you do that
[3:56:46] <+hypemaster19> !MOTIVATED
[3:56:46] <@Moobot> 406 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[3:56:51] <OkamiDude15> @duraju true

[3:57:00] <+InstiGaitan> high monk use to be B R O K E N
[3:57:01] <Dragon_Batman> Hah good stuff Minh
[3:57:15] <+MagiKestral> Vinny vinesauce ended there and it was the last kuro item, the blue balls were felt
[3:57:17] <NocturnalRites> Of course they did we cant have fun in a FromSoft game now can we
[3:57:20] <+Exuberant_Vagabond> shrek?
[3:57:23] <cheffailure> High monk was busted. Now it's respectable as a Mikiri.
[3:57:25] <OkamiDude15> @fatal_penguin_ i think its like 1 in the morning right now
[3:57:26] <Tisaric> sounds like Vinny
[3:57:30] <Raldavar> cue Kaine's theme
[3:57:40] <Graxe_> That's a giant kidney stone
[3:57:42] <Futurecity10> Thats one hell of a kidney stone
[3:57:54] <Dragon_Batman> Did they lessen the time in air or something for high monk?
[3:58:09] <cheffailure> No, just reduced posture damage dealt.
[3:58:14] <cheffailure> For the first hit.
[3:58:35] <NocturnalRites> thats not that bad
[3:58:37] <Dragon_Batman> oooh, on paper that doesn't sound so bad
[3:58:45] <cheffailure> So it does about the same as Mikiri on the first hit.
[3:58:57] <cheffailure> The rest of the combo is slightly buffed to encourage further use.
[3:58:57] <+zanzibar_junker> Good work woolie
[3:59:00] <+InstiGaitan> nah its not bad its just it used to be totally broken
[3:59:13] <Dragon_Batman> Nice that 's not bad as a buff and nerf
[3:59:14] <cheffailure> Good job Woolie.
[3:59:15] <natebud> And woolie has to remember to go swimming.
[3:59:24] <Dragon_Batman> I really like that skill regardless
[3:59:25] <+InstiGaitan> like destroy sweep bosses immediately broken
[3:59:31] <NocturnalRites> Ca't wait to see him fight the big boy
[3:59:42] <+Exuberant_Vagabond> woolie u look great
[3:59:45] <zamzoph> hah, that won't happen
[3:59:57] <cheffailure> Woolie is fighting against game design. That's a fun way to approach.
[4:00:10] <+nekodelic> well, good fucking luck, Woolie
[4:00:10] <Dragon_Batman> I loved the bonefist in Dark Souls one, fucking Shoryu
[4:00:23] <xiccy> punching sucks in the Souls games except the Bonefist gauntlets
[4:00:40] <natebud> A game made around the Royal Guard and Woolie wants less royal guard.

[4:04:20] <%Hammerknife> oh shit woolie's on
[4:04:35] <RC_S3kshun8> @WoolieVersus I don't think there is any audio, but the candid reactions are cool. I think the classy thing to do would be to afterward go to each table and ask for their permission or blur their faces out.
[4:04:42] <%DashXero> It would suck to be committing a crime or plotting a crime when that camera comes by.
[4:04:52] <worldbrand> sharp inhale through gritted teeth is the correct response
[4:04:57] <Nina96> wait nico nico isnt a meme?

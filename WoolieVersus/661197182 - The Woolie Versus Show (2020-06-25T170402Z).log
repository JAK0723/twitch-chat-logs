[0:20:45] <+blaze__drag> I wonder if they'll take a look at the "true sequel" bug fables after they finish TTYD
[0:20:55] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @Lion_kun He'll defo play 2 and Reach. But i dont thin he'll play 3 and 4 until PC release
[0:20:55] <%RedoctoberWolf> RedoctoberWolf subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:21:07] <%Superbro64> @blaze__drag last time I heard, bug fables is ok
[0:21:16] <%Superbro64> true sequel to ttyd is spm anyway
[0:21:18] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> So hyped for TRIGGER doing a Cyberpunk 2077 anime
[0:21:22] <+ToastyMozart> They still have SPM before Bug Fables
[0:21:34] <%DappercatEsquire> LP the Game Dot Com
[0:21:35] <+blaze__drag> imo bug fables is even better than TTYD
[0:21:50] <%Superbro64> that's a take
[0:21:52] <Ryutaryi> That's some high Bug Fables praise. Gotta check it out
[0:21:53] <derap41> woolie did you check the Cyberpunk gameplay its awesome
[0:21:57] <+blaze__drag> it's at least comparable in goodness
[0:21:59] <+ToastyMozart> Yo they got imaishi for the 2077 anime too!
[0:22:01] <BlackMage66652> But does Bug Fables have bug crimes?
[0:22:10] <+blaze__drag> can confirm bug crimes
[0:22:12] <%YakumoYomi> Sega Channel was rad, though.
[0:22:14] <+EdenOfLove> Homies gonna dump on my SEGANET?
[0:22:15] <GenericSoda> Bug Fables seems like an interestingspin on the formula with its fixed party

[0:22:30] <nyacoo> kurosu bando
[0:22:30] <%Superbro64> CROSS you mean Kappa
[0:22:51] <GenericSoda> there is evidence in the game to suggest cross is the right pronunciation actually
[0:22:56] <+blaze__drag> but yeah for real it's like a nice call back of course, but it doesn't drown itself too heavily in trying to be TTYD
[0:23:00] <andrex2311> Cross-Counter or X-Counter?
[0:23:07] <+blaze__drag> it does a lot to evolve and set itself apart
[0:23:13] <rubbishbinge> wait holy shit was xfire cross fire all this time?

[0:23:24] <+blaze__drag> kinda like what TTYD was to PM64

[0:38:03] <%RichochetForce> @Snakes_dk Yeah, CDPR clearly knows their stuff
[0:38:04] <savetitania> ARAKI WOULD TOTALLY WATCH THE WIRE
[0:38:07] <%DatAsuna> Araki is the biggest ameriboo tho
[0:38:08] <+jiggy_snipe> he might tho
[0:38:13] <%SirGO0SE> part 6 is just the wire
[0:38:15] <Potatoidea> Araki loves Western movies so much he spoiled the Sixth Sense in Part 6
[0:38:20] <Papa_Bearman> Yeah, Giga Drill Breaker...that's what I did last night.
[0:38:21] <glass_marcus> Araki is a weird al stan
[0:38:23] <GenericSoda> Araki also loved Bomberman

[0:38:42] <%FuqBoiSlim> You think Araki knows what a frame trap is?
[0:38:47] <skyheys> too bad about indivisible the game
[0:38:48] <carranca801> Damn, I would watch a The Wire season with Stands
[0:38:52] <@Solidus_113> Trigger has a Patreon
[0:38:53] <Carmesinus> shatae had a trigger intro too
[0:38:55] <%Lion_kun> Didnt Araki complain about walking dead at some point?

[0:39:07] <Potatoidea> There was also some manga out there where they were talking about The Wire, don't remember the name
[0:39:08] <huskarl_zap> no
[0:39:11] <%ringabal> Indivisible would've been better off an anime
[0:39:13] <andrex2311> Trigger has a Patreon? really?
[0:39:16] <GenericSoda> I think a sequel to Indivisible could be amazing
[0:39:22] <Snakes_dk> kinda like For Honor in samsho too

[0:40:14] <%SuperKirby24> LUL
[0:40:14] <+Hylian726> still not sold on the new one, but I'll give it a chance
[0:40:14] <%DatAsuna> No, the new one is as much an RPG as colour splash it seems
[0:40:15] <%hawk_rush> LUL
[0:40:16] <gridib> Well Mario & Luigi is dead, so....
[0:40:17] <%RedoctoberWolf> new one looks like better than last two but not as good as first 3

[0:40:48] <Curtis_64> wait for SPM?
[0:40:49] <+Ancopro> yea
[0:40:50] <andrex2311> YES
[0:40:50] <%RedoctoberWolf> super is good
[0:40:50] <%Proxzo> SUPER PAPER MARIO GOOD
[0:40:50] <%ringabal> YES
[0:40:51] <%RichochetForce> Yes
[0:40:51] <+Dimfish> yes its good
[0:40:52] <%hawk_rush> it's got a really good story
[0:40:53] <+AbnormalVoid> it's good, but not as good as the first two
[0:40:53] <Daniel_Is_I> Super Paper Mario is a solid third place
[0:40:53] <Louie_Salmon> Arguably
[0:40:54] <%Lunatyr_> SPM is very different
[0:40:54] <%RadicalWeegee> The best story
[0:40:54] <%Club_Sodar> SPM is OKAY
[0:40:54] <+BigCoffee> it's good but it's not a rpg
[0:40:55] <GarbageNirvana> It's okay
[0:40:55] <gridib> Its alright
[0:40:55] <Solidnick18> super paper mario is good
[0:40:55] <+Zenryoku21> yes
[0:40:56] <Snakes_dk> the last good one for many
[0:40:56] <+GreenCMD> super is good, but the combat system gets stale
[0:40:56] <%SomersaultJustice> SPM is eh
[0:40:56] <chikubihime> spm good
[0:40:56] <%Josef_Stryker> One Guy?
[0:40:57] <%DatAsuna> Super is one of the last okay ones
[0:40:57] <+ConLin_Arts_> it is great!
[0:40:58] <%PA_Master> Super Paper Mario's some good stuff imo
[0:40:58] <+pectusumbra> It's not an RPG but it's apparently wild
[0:40:58] <bbblaketwitching> its different
[0:40:59] <cursedcharley> It's good but the fandom is split on it
[0:40:59] <nyacoo> Considered the last one of the old style
[0:40:59] <%RichochetForce> It has a really good story, but not an RPG.
[0:40:59] <The_Maddness> Japan general gamers have bad taste, news at 11
[0:41:00] <knyttstories> STory is good, gameplay is boring
[0:41:00] <shiny_prinny> it's just not a turn based rpg but it's fine
[0:41:00] <+UberWolfman> It was spam survey lol
[0:41:01] <rubbishbinge> It's got some great stuff
[0:41:02] <%Griff_the_Mystic> SPM rides the line
[0:41:02] <Kougsss> SPM is aight but better in retrospect
[0:41:02] <%SuperKirby24> wait people actually filled those club nintendo surveys out legitimately? LUL
[0:41:02] <%ekodrop> it was boring
[0:41:02] <Ardailec> Super Paper Mario has a good story, just weird gameplay
[0:41:04] <Prevot> yep japan only club nintendo surveys fucked over this franchjse
[0:41:05] <+Kahylen123> Best story
[0:41:05] <bbblaketwitching> but good?
[0:41:05] <+TheDyingPride> The first one after TTYD
[0:41:06] <skyheys> Super Paper Mario goes even harder on story than TTYD
[0:41:08] <%Ancopro> it steps away from turn based but its still good
[0:41:09] <+Hylian726> it's good, not as great, but also super different
[0:41:11] <Papa_Bearman> Yeah, but that's Super Paper Mario, which was a linear platformer with RPG elements.
[0:41:14] <%Club_Sodar> SPM IS THE LAST GOOD ONE
[0:41:15] <Davybot> its good game just not an rpg
[0:41:15] <+Dimfish> the story is literally the only thing SPM does well
[0:41:16] <%shoutofthehobo> We should make our own RPG with blackjack and hookers
[0:41:16] <glass_marcus> the game is meh, the story is the best tho
[0:41:18] <%hawk_rush> stop sending spoilerrrrrs
[0:41:21] <jjcrow21> super paper mario was ok
[0:41:21] <TheArrow_> people didn't like super paper mario on release, but people have warmed up to it
[0:41:22] <%Th3SmartAlec> Spoiler donations sbfpSetIn
[0:41:23] <%RadicalWeegee> The last good one
[0:41:25] <Louie_Salmon> It's the exact breaking point, some say yes, some say no, but it was absolutely the end
[0:41:25] <$Superdandy96> Super Paper Mario is good story, but the gameplay is a complete departure

[1:30:17] <%LynbellDaYo> waste of a turn
[1:30:20] <%Chatterbox1991> damage buf
[1:30:25] <%NopeBadguy> It's a damage buff
[1:30:25] <@akuda_bar> charge sux.
[1:30:25] <DopeyDragon> Charge damage
[1:30:25] <Am_Shigar00> You use a turn to boost attack power
[1:30:26] <Papa_Bearman> It increases your next attack.
[1:30:27] <laziest_lid> Dont give up skeleton
[1:30:29] <%MayorRev> CHARGE TIME
[1:30:29] <+marumariball> its a damage buff
[1:30:30] <Manwad> big number!
[1:30:30] <%DensityD> hi I'm daisy
[1:30:30] <+Dimfish> its attack up
[1:30:30] <bbblaketwitching> bad unless it isnt
[1:30:31] <Nomad94> it sucks
[1:30:31] <SixthSun2> Charge is basically a temp attack up
[1:30:33] <%ringabal> Why would you Charge when you can STRIKE
[1:30:34] <+AsinPersuasion> its a way to get past defense early
[1:30:34] <The_Maddness> Charge is pretty good
[1:30:35] <Cynical_Canadian> Damage buff
[1:30:35] <+Grayhammatter> damage buffs
[1:30:37] <+AsinPersuasion> its fine
[1:30:38] <niozonbi> Damage boost. Cheap, but wastes a turn.
[1:30:40] <%SomersaultJustice> it's Yang's Focus
[1:30:40] <Parapattern> Leviossssaaaaa
[1:30:41] <shiny_prinny> damage go up
[1:30:42] <%Ancopro> for one move
[1:30:43] <Papa_Bearman> Yeah, damage up for a turn. Goes up to five.
[1:30:43] <%Proxzo> And you can stack it
[1:30:43] <rubbishbinge> STRIKE
[1:30:44] <Cynical_Canadian> It's good if used with the right move
[1:30:46] <%Griff_the_Mystic> Charge is the thing Marilyn did
[1:30:48] <+TheDyingPride> Damage up for next attack, it's okay, but it's a waste of a turn most of the time
[1:30:50] <niozonbi> It stacks too
[1:30:52] <shiny_prinny> if you stack it you get big charges too
[1:30:52] <%hawk_rush> charge is amazing
[1:30:54] <Am_Shigar00> I personally never cared for it
[1:30:54] <bbblaketwitching> when you do a defend type MOVE
[1:30:58] <+GiantRatThatMakesTheRulz> damage go up. but fp go down
[1:30:59] <+GreenCMD> good for multihits
[1:31:02] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> 1st TRY
[1:31:03] <%wrightlight94> Shine get
[1:31:04] <shiny_prinny> *stack the badge i mean
[1:31:04] <Thunderhog> @WoolieVersus It's good for multi hit moves
[1:31:07] <%SuperKirby24> SHINE GET
[1:31:07] <niozonbi> Very good for multihits
[1:31:13] <+RealThiele> on telegraphed perfect defense fights
[1:31:20] <bbblaketwitching> multiple charges also makes it better
[1:31:24] <+Dimfish> multihits are strong with it too
[1:31:25] <Cynical_Canadian> Power bounce + Charge is good if I remember right
[1:31:29] <niozonbi> It's just one attack per charge
[1:31:32] <%Chatterbox1991> Koops getting randi
[1:31:36] <Louie_Salmon> It adds 1 damage, which is pretty massive in a game where damage is single digit
[1:31:38] <bbblaketwitching> as in using multiple of the badge is good
[1:31:43] <Papa_Bearman> Yeah, you can stack up to five times.
[1:31:44] <niozonbi> but it stacks
[1:31:45] <+Euphbugg> It's a +1 so it is best for multi attacks
[1:31:56] <exnuart> charges stack
[1:31:58] <%hawk_rush> I think you can charge again
[1:31:59] <Cynical_Canadian> You can use it multiple times in a row
[1:32:00] <%ozmon> https://clips.twitch.tv/PlumpFamousYakAMPTropPunch
[1:32:01] <niozonbi> no it stacks on it's own. Wxtra badges just gives more per turn
[1:32:02] <shiny_prinny> could test it
[1:32:03] <%gatorafan> TBH in this game 200% is like... +2
[1:32:05] <+RealThiele> charge quake
[1:32:06] <The_Maddness> @WoolieVersus You can stack charges
[1:32:09] <+marumariball> its like +1 damage
[1:32:09] <%Ancopro> +1
[1:32:09] <niozonbi> 1 point
[1:32:14] <+AsinPersuasion> its flat 1
[1:32:16] <The_Maddness> @WoolieVersus +1 per charge
[1:32:17] <SixthSun2> 1 point of damage
[1:32:17] <%hawk_rush> it got nerfed from paper mario 1 :(
[1:32:18] <+Euphbugg> +1 atk
[1:32:18] <DopeyDragon> 1 damage iirc
[1:32:19] <niozonbi> 1 point per use
[1:32:20] <Cynical_Canadian> Watt from the first game was better
[1:32:24] <bbblaketwitching> its all good really, you just need to put effort into jt
[1:32:25] <DopeyDragon> YET
[1:32:25] <Louie_Salmon> Percentage buff would weird in a game with single digits
[1:32:27] <+AsinPersuasion> you do 2 damage
[1:32:28] <%SomersaultJustice> ONE POINT
[1:32:29] <%Th3SmartAlec> 1 point %
[1:32:30] <jjcrow21> 1 atk
[1:32:35] <+AsinPersuasion> its +50% per hit
[1:32:38] <Thunderhog> @WoolieVersus It's 1 point but used with a multi hit move it would be a multiplicative damage buff
[1:32:38] <niozonbi> Woolie, 1 point is a 50% increase
[1:32:38] <exnuart> stacks increase by one until 99
[1:32:43] <Papa_Bearman> If you use Charge, you win the game.
[1:32:45] <%RichochetForce> 50% more per hit
[1:32:52] <DopeyDragon> 1 point is 50%
[1:32:53] <bbblaketwitching> to be fair he was asking for 200%
[1:32:55] <niozonbi> +1 = 50%
[1:32:59] <jjcrow21> stack charge
[1:33:05] <+kapcommunist> i love being the universe CarlSmile
[1:33:06] <+AsinPersuasion> +1 on a triple jump multibounce is +3

[1:45:54] <+Loinclothiclese> GOT SOME RARE ITEMS
[1:45:54] <missingangle> Yeah, Woolie can just stick to other items and shrooms for healing. I really doubt he actually NEEDS the 50 HP
[1:45:59] <missingangle> nor will he ever
[1:46:01] <niozonbi> Just use the rest in battle

[1:46:17] <Am_Shigar00> Yeah, might as well get rid of it.
[1:46:19] <%dinnydanny777> Hero's Brew?
[1:46:20] <%lewdskeletor13> The Wario outfit will allow you to fully become Woolio
[1:46:23] <niozonbi> Yeah, sell if you won't use
[1:46:27] <$Superdandy96> WHA
[1:46:29] <%dinnydanny777> X Items are the speedrun tech
[1:46:29] <penitentpentwitch> Depends on the game
[1:46:30] <+AsinPersuasion> @indigo_automaton race war over
[1:46:32] <bbblaketwitching> they are?
[1:46:32] <missingangle> I still don't use the X items
[1:46:36] <%RadicalWeegee> naahhh thats free money
[1:46:37] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Never used one
[1:46:39] <$tkuwari> I never use those
[1:46:41] <+TheNotoriousJTS> those items are big garbo i stand by this
[1:46:41] <%hawk_rush> x items are blessed
[1:46:42] <Am_Shigar00> for casual playthrough, they're never useful.
[1:46:42] <Daniel_Is_I> They're not great, they're just useful for speedruns
[1:46:43] <%Ancopro> same LUL
[1:46:44] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Only in spedruns
[1:46:45] <+Grayhammatter> X items are super good
[1:46:48] <Prevot> x items are worthless in single player pokemon
[1:46:48] <%Irridium> maybe. but fuck those items.
[1:46:48] <JesusWillikers> in SMT you HAVE you buff
[1:46:51] <Am_Shigar00> @WoolieVersus Btw, go to the corner of the store to find a secret.
[1:46:55] <%krispen_wa> X-items are for COWARDS
[1:46:58] <+RealThiele> mighty guard ftw
[1:46:59] <niozonbi> Hey what's behind that?
[1:47:00] <+Hylian726> no-items nuzlocke is the way to play anyway
[1:47:01] <CastellanVon> You never really need buffs for story stuff. But they're amazing for multiplayer and speedruns in Pokemon
[1:47:06] <%LynbellDaYo> buffs in persona are great
[1:47:07] <bbblaketwitching> oh look, its that thing woolie killed his fans over
[1:47:08] <Ardailec> Not using Rakukaja in an SMT game D:
[1:47:10] <DopeyDragon> m y s t e r y
[1:47:16] <Toaster_Noodle> X items were always for beyond the standard playthrough in my eyes
[1:47:18] <rubbishbinge> rakukaja is your friend
[1:47:19] <dizimous> buffs are super good in SMT
[1:47:24] <bbblaketwitching> RECOGNIZEEE
[1:47:26] <%chosenjuan42> buffs are amazing for multi hitting moves
[1:47:27] <CursedNobleman> @bbblaketwitching theres a jetpack? where!?
[1:47:30] <Louie_Salmon> 3 gold for a mystery, kind of a sick deal honestly
[1:47:31] <Am_Shigar00> It's only like 5 damage/HP though.
[1:47:34] <%RichochetForce> @Ardailec Laughs in Matador
[1:47:34] <rubbishbinge> drains 5
[1:47:36] <$tkuwari> Buffs are mandatory in SMT
[1:47:40] <Ardailec> Like I can see not using Makakaja or Tarukaja but not using defensive buffs D:
[1:47:41] <The_Maddness> It pierces though
[1:47:43] <%ringabal> Mister Mineeseeks
[1:47:43] <damienlunas> O
[1:47:45] <slimey0> secret in this room
[1:47:50] <niozonbi> Wug halls
[1:47:52] <$Superdandy96> That mystery is a steal, 3 coins? Whoa
[1:47:54] <+linSP> Buffing depends on the game
[1:47:55] <CastellanVon> Buffs are hella OP in persona. Theyre like 50% buffs, 3 turns. You gotta at least stack it up in SMT to get that high.
[1:47:55] <niozonbi> Check behind
[1:47:57] <Am_Shigar00> Go behind that stump
[1:47:59] <niozonbi> Left side
[1:48:01] <SixthSun2> Check behind stuff
[1:48:01] <Louie_Salmon> But then you can use it!
[1:48:04] <bbblaketwitching> @cursednobleman I'm sure if there was one, an audience member would throw it at Woolie, and he would get hammered
[1:48:05] <The_Maddness> Saying Only 5 damage doesnt work in this game, damage numbers are inherently low
[1:48:06] <+GreenCMD> THE STUMP
[1:48:07] <ThePizzaLovingTurtle> Does he need Punio for the secret?
[1:48:07] <sunnythedrunk> Buy mystery and use it immedietely
[1:48:09] <exnuart> behind the log
[1:48:09] <damienlunas> I'm Mini Mr. Mini, look at me!
[1:48:11] <Toaster_Noodle> Just use your items more then
[1:48:11] <+StrawberryPantsu> I COULD BE ANYTHING
[1:48:11] <niozonbi> Left side Woolz
[1:48:11] <The_Maddness> buy mushrooms
[1:48:14] <+AbnormalVoid> Fart Power
[1:48:15] <nyacoo> You're supposed to use them, not assign it a permanent slot
[1:48:17] <Am_Shigar00> noooo!
[1:48:18] <niozonbi> Secret in shop
[1:48:21] <CursedNobleman> psaGoblin Items are a problem
[1:48:29] <%KyoryUtchy> left side
[1:48:33] <niozonbi> Secret in the left
[1:48:38] <Nyerp> did he grind offscreen
[1:48:40] <$Superdandy96> Woolz, you‚Äôre letting the goblins win
[1:48:44] <niozonbi> Behind
[1:48:46] <Am_Shigar00> behind
[1:48:48] <bleugh> items are the enemy
[1:48:48] <$tkuwari> Good Try
[1:48:52] <Louie_Salmon> If you really view items as taking up slots, then why not store everything?
[1:48:53] <bbblaketwitching> ?
[1:48:54] <Am_Shigar00> huh?
[1:48:54] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1275210654773915649?s=20
[1:48:55] <niozonbi> What?
[1:48:59] <%gatorafan> What's the point of items if you can't hoard dozens of them and never use them? daedra1DerpyTibs
[1:48:59] <ThePizzaLovingTurtle> The secret doesn't trigger if Punio isn't here guys.
[1:49:02] <Papa_Bearman> If you came here with the Punies, something extra would happen.
[1:49:04] <$tkuwari> did One Guy lie?

[1:49:59] <Louie_Salmon> This is just goblins in a suit
[1:50:00] <%ringabal> "You're not just a Guy, you're the whole fraternity!"
[1:50:01] <%dinnydanny777> The items let you kill enemies which are harder
[1:50:04] <Papa_Bearman> People keep mentioning that HD switch - I guess I have an older GameCube because I have NO IDEA what you're talking about.
[1:50:09] <%lewdskeletor13> Yeah Woolie is using his HD button

[1:58:43] <%Proxzo> yeah
[1:58:44] <+TheDyingPride> It's jank, but also you did it wrong to make it jank

[1:58:46] <DopeyDragon> Pikmin
[1:58:46] <%kyh9> Just go to the elder
[1:58:46] <%hawk_rush> I don't think anyone intended woolie to do it like how he did it
[1:58:46] <+ZoltanBMagnus> one is in the cage?
[1:58:47] <GenericSoda> i do not reeber it being this frustrating
[1:58:48] <+Grayhammatter> the terrible 101
[1:58:49] <MrGameNJosh> one of two of this games flaws
[1:58:50] <%Jetzord> You might just have to go to the elder
[1:58:50] <hzealot> YOU CAN'T WALK IN THE CAGE

[1:58:54] <exnuart> this is nintendo showing the gamecube can handle a bunch of sprites
[1:58:55] <Bguy32> This all happened because you got out of the cage to blow
[1:58:55] <%chosenjuan42> You made it jank
[1:58:55] <bevyrage> this cage is the legit reason why the elder exists in this game btw. if you BLOW FROM OUTSIDE THE CAGE the punies can get locked in the bars at the back. if you don't leave the cage to blow them into the hole it doesn't happen.
[1:58:56] <Nyerp> dont remember this happening to me
[1:58:59] <$tkuwari> How do you keep losing them??

[2:01:30] <+Dimfish> this is bustex
[2:01:30] <%hawk_rush> you kind of did it LUL
[2:01:32] <GenericSoda> no this is totally not your fault

[2:01:39] <derap41> Its a big mess
[2:01:40] <+TheOneCalledRock> he can bypass it by getting the shop secret
[2:01:40] <niozonbi> Go to cage, blow from inside
[2:01:41] <$tkuwari> Woolie This Is NOT Your Fault
[2:01:41] <Scumpedog> he's in the cage
[2:01:42] <+Zenryoku21> its totally explainable
[2:01:42] <shiny_prinny> no it's stupid jank and the worst
[2:01:44] <+Kduff89> emongKEK
[2:01:44] <bbblaketwitching> you tried to blow through a wall
[2:01:44] <%heartlesshealer> NEVER blow from OUTSIDE cage
[2:01:46] <%hawk_rush> it's column A, columnB
[2:01:46] <DopeyDragon> It's half you and half the system
[2:01:46] <%Lunatyr_> Go back to the cage

[2:01:48] <%suitangi021> 1 stuck in cage
[2:01:49] <niozonbi> Shop secret will solve this problem
[2:01:49] <KityLinn> I think there's a short circut between the cough and the controller
[2:01:49] <BreakersAweigh> gamecube hardware
[2:01:49] <Snakes_dk> LUL
[2:01:49] <Enemy_Missing> so did blow at them from outside the cage for some reason lmao
[2:01:52] <sirmcslushers> It can be jank if you aren'
[2:01:52] <+Huttersson> You completely effed it up by insisting of blowing outside the cage for one reason
[2:01:54] <Enemy_Missing> that prob is what did it
[2:01:54] <bbblaketwitching> you ignored the lining up mechanic
[2:01:55] <sirmcslushers> aren't careful*
[2:01:55] <KityLinn> couch*
[2:01:56] <+TheDyingPride> THAT one was a bug, no doubt. THIS one is due to your oddball solution
[2:01:58] <Louie_Salmon> It definitely a jank mechanic but damn
[2:02:00] <hzealot> @woolieversus your fault of blowing out of the cage
[2:02:02] <nyacoo> Is this really an escort mission though?
[2:02:04] <+pectusumbra> This is the reason people don't like this chapter
[2:02:06] <TeethMuncher> I'm blaming Woolie on this one.
[2:02:07] <benbag13> one stuck in the cage
[2:02:07] <%gatorafan> Universe is chaos daedra1DrunkTibs
[2:02:12] <niozonbi> One in cage
[2:02:12] <%chosenjuan42> THAT ONE GUY IN CAGE
[2:02:14] <SixthSun2> Yup, this is why the Elder can do that, purely from QA
[2:02:15] <%dinnydanny777> Maybe the Gamecube couldn't handle 101 Punies on screen
[2:02:17] <%LynbellDaYo> that wasn't the issue
[2:02:18] <Bguy32> I am blaming Woolie for
[2:02:20] <%heartlesshealer> it's not escort, it's just wonderful 101
[2:02:20] <niozonbi> Shop secret will bypass this
[2:02:24] <bbblaketwitching> ah yes, "the button"
[2:02:25] <%heroversusofficial> :0

[2:02:37] <Bguy32> only you
[2:02:38] <%chosenjuan42> QA brain
[2:02:39] <bevyrage> user path 1 has the majority of the players blowing punies from inside the cage, not leaving it to blow from outside. this is a bug that you've unintentionally caused.
[2:02:39] <InXplotch> you played it super fuckin weird, dude
[2:02:39] <%heartlesshealer> ???
[2:02:41] <+Huttersson> The issue is that you blew it all weirdly into the back by doing it outside.
[2:02:41] <zakaraz> don't worry woolie, this is the worst chapter in the game but its followed by maybe the best chapter
[2:02:42] <+AsinPersuasion> am i wrong? no it is the children that are wrong
[2:02:43] <JetpackMcQuack> Games aren't made by accident guys
[2:02:44] <insaneintentionsyo> back to the cage
[2:02:47] <+TheOneCalledRock> GUYS ITS FINE
[2:02:48] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> leave them
[2:02:53] <%hawk_rush> LUL this is amazing
[2:02:53] <%LynbellDaYo> going down wasn't the issue at all, you're supposed to do that
[2:02:53] <%chosenjuan42> bring them
[2:02:54] <+TheOneCalledRock> ITS FINE ITS FINE
[2:02:55] <%dinnydanny777> Where'd they go
[2:02:55] <Louie_Salmon> You probably don't want any punis right now
[2:02:56] <bbblaketwitching> ?
[2:03:00] <exnuart> i think he still needs the punis for one last sequence
[2:03:00] <Am_Shigar00> There are bits where he screwed up, but it's also super janky as well
[2:03:00] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:03:03] <bbblaketwitching> OH GOD
[2:03:04] <%DorianCreed> Leave them, then Elder-summon them back later
[2:03:05] <Enemy_Missing> ?
[2:03:06] <crunkers_> dont bring them
[2:03:07] <shiny_prinny> it's probably programmed to not let you call them until they fall out the cage hoole
[2:03:07] <%Lunatyr_> Don't bring more
[2:03:08] <hzealot> now what are you doing
[2:03:09] <bbblaketwitching> HES STILL DOING IT

[2:04:04] <%heartlesshealer> perfect time to get that twitch network error
[2:04:07] <%kyh9> Yes, basically
[2:04:09] <%Proxzo> This area is really bad
[2:04:09] <silverira> holy shit this manga is a mess
[2:04:11] <skyheys> TTYD (Final)

[2:04:22] <bbblaketwitching> Race wars sound pretty good right now
[2:04:22] <%prime_name> This session is taking Woolie way too back to the QA days

[2:04:29] <%chosenjuan42> backtrack for 5 then
[2:04:31] <+TheDyingPride> This chapter sucks precisely because of this btw
[2:04:32] <insaneintentionsyo> chapter 3 will forgive all
[2:04:33] <Bguy32> I'm pretty sure my final time for being the game is less than wooly's current time
[2:04:33] <%heartlesshealer> This is the part of Hunter x Hunter where we get the napkin pages
[2:04:36] <thetntm> woolie if you blow from outside the cage this time I am 100% blaming that on you though
[2:04:43] <niozonbi> This part is why the Elder exists
[2:04:48] <%kralec> @WoolieVersus well, this chapter is arguablly the worst in the game because of this bullshit mechanic shit.
[2:04:49] <+Juriasu> there he is PogChamp

[2:05:23] <%Chatterbox1991> woolie already done
[2:05:23] <InXplotch> ITS THE LEAST FINE
[2:05:23] <thetntm> it doesn't matter but you knew that was the most risky way of doing it
[2:05:26] <KityLinn> Woolie is doing it on purpose now..
[2:05:26] <+TheOneCalledRock> CHAT

[2:05:31] <Welijn> It was your fault.

[2:05:32] <Bguy32> Literally Two Hours on this Cage Puzzle
[2:05:32] <%ringabal> Remember the future: Rustling
[2:05:32] <$tkuwari> THIS IS GOING GREAT
[2:05:32] <+RowenCleric> I feel like this is a mechanic where the devs would be like "well you are supposed to get frustrated by punies so we kept it"
[2:05:33] <Infeirno23> it shouldnt matter chat that is bad game design
[2:05:33] <%RedoctoberWolf> its fine but its so roundabout
[2:05:35] <jjcrow21> everything is not fine
[2:05:36] <%prime_name> ENJOY THE GAME WOOLIE
[2:05:37] <%gatorafan> It doesn't matter now what happens I will NEVER GIVE UP THE FIIIGHT SourPls
[2:05:38] <%kyh9> Woolie will remember that
[2:05:40] <Toaster_Noodle> Woolie just throws his head at the wall and then is confused as to why it doesn't work. That was kinda insane
[2:05:40] <+AsinPersuasion> ayy i see you reggie
[2:05:41] <derap41> LUL
[2:05:41] <%heartlesshealer> It lowers probability. Does not matter =anymore=, but did when =the thing= happened

[2:05:42] <JetpackMcQuack> I bet you use two trips to carry your groceries
[2:05:44] <+ahdurian> wools mad
[2:05:45] <thetntm> it shouldn't matter but at this point you know it does
[2:05:48] <%chosenjuan42> backtrack for the 5
[2:05:50] <KityLinn> the blow out
[2:05:51] <shiny_prinny> no this should work
[2:05:51] <+Huttersson> Thing that messes me up is that it doesn't even make sense to go outside of the cage to blow them in the first place.
[2:05:53] <noe_juan_kanobe> Perfect time to join the stream O_O
[2:05:53] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> woolies got it
[2:05:57] <Bguy32> It's all right The Glitz Pit will bring this LP back
[2:05:58] <bbblaketwitching> if you did any of this in an intuitive way, you wouldn't encounter these problems

[2:08:32] <Louie_Salmon> This is a Cascade of slightly mislearned mechanics. He was allowed to continue once without using the orb as intended, so he never got hands-on time using the orb and blow punis at point-blank to see how good it is. This is not "user path 1"

[2:13:17] <$Superdandy96> Herding mechanic are ass
[2:13:19] <%chosenjuan42> JANK
[2:13:19] <Solidnick18> yeah not the best
[2:13:21] <insaneintentionsyo> we all hate this chapter
[2:13:22] <Am_Shigar00> I honestly like the idea of the mechanic, but yeah, it's super jank.
[2:13:22] <skyheys> he did it!
[2:13:25] <%indigo_automaton> Punies? More like JANKIES
[2:13:25] <derap41> Blows more like
[2:13:26] <+Dimfish> chapter 2 is consistently the worst chapter
[2:13:27] <bbblaketwitching> oh my
[2:13:28] <%StarMechV> dont worry WOOLIE this is probably the worst dungeons get
[2:13:29] <%hawk_rush> it is jank, but you also make it worse LUL
[2:13:31] <bbblaketwitching> HES DOING IT
[2:13:31] <Bguy32> it's objectively the worst chapter in the game
[2:13:32] <+MrAsmoday> Yeah this is the worst chapter for sure
[2:13:36] <Nyerp> its jank but you're also impatient
[2:13:36] <%chosenjuan42> J A N K
[2:13:36] <Welijn> Oh no! There is no cage to blow from the outside!
[2:13:36] <niozonbi> Ye
[2:13:37] <Cynical_Canadian> It's one of the few things that I'd say is bad in this game
[2:13:37] <%gatorafan> No wonder Nintendo destroyed this franchise Kappa
[2:13:40] <%heartlesshealer> it's both
[2:13:45] <thetntm> did you leave the sunstone behind
[2:13:47] <niozonbi> Bit o' both
[2:13:47] <@akuda_bar> this dungeon does suck
[2:13:49] <TeethMuncher> This is post Pikmin, btw
[2:13:51] <%lewdskeletor13> Everyone agrees this is the worst chapter
[2:13:51] <Nomad94> we good now
[2:13:51] <+TheDyingPride> There was a bit of both
[2:13:51] <+Euphbugg> Bit of both
[2:13:52] <%kralec> @WoolieVersus nah, you right. speed runners glitch it out so they always have the punis with them.
[2:13:52] <missingangle> It's a bad section, no lie
[2:13:59] <$Superdandy96> Thank god this is the only chapter that does this
[2:13:59] <thetntm> yes agreed
[2:14:00] <%indigo_automaton> It's 50/50
[2:14:00] <CastellanVon> Don't worry the next chapter is great
[2:14:00] <SyLuX45> Pikmin inspired this I feel
[2:14:01] <Ragnakawaii> This is the worst part of the game tbh
[2:14:01] <%TomFrank> this seems pretty convoluted
[2:14:02] <+MrAsmoday> This is the one and only bad chapter
[2:14:02] <niozonbi> Almost done tho
[2:14:03] <MasterMushin> Nah
[2:14:03] <Solidnick18> all good woolie
[2:14:03] <bbblaketwitching> thankfully we'll never do this again
[2:14:03] <+pectusumbra> This is all the game woolie, you good
[2:14:05] <%dinnydanny777> What are you talking about this looks so fun
[2:14:08] <penitentpentwitch> The combo is strong, but the dungeon isn't the best
[2:14:08] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah I think everyone has some issues
[2:14:09] <insaneintentionsyo> you're about to be done thankfully
[2:14:09] <%heroversusofficial> Cheer500 Peace was never an option. Punies are to Jabbis like Tobirama is to Uchihas.
[2:14:10] <Manwad> it's the worst, and it's all uphill from here
[2:14:10] <hzealot> this is worse than pat onra dinn
[2:14:10] <%SvenHolgersson> This section is the only blemish
[2:14:11] <%lewdskeletor13> It‚Äôs all fun Woolz
[2:14:11] <bbblaketwitching> and it only gets better from here
[2:14:11] <%heroversusofficial> heroversusofficial's Cheer shared rewards to 10 others in Chat! 
[2:14:12] <GenericSoda> people who play fighting games are honest about owning up to mistakes
[2:14:13] <derap41> Its like only the doors not the pipes that cause issues
[2:14:13] <%Th3SmartAlec> thats fair
[2:14:16] <+Dimfish> 82
[2:14:17] <$BallerSwagBro9k> dont worry WE LOVE IT
[2:14:17] <%heartlesshealer> OH NO THE STAIRS

[2:14:19] <shiny_prinny> oh no
[2:14:19] <+Euphbugg> LUL
[2:14:19] <Bguy32> Its morel like 70/30 your fault
[2:14:21] <+TheDyingPride> This is probably the worst chapter. It's all up from here
[2:14:25] <GenericSoda> dont break the line
[2:14:26] <%indigo_automaton> Thanks for the PrideStrong @heroversusofficial Thanks dude!
[2:14:33] <Enemy_Missing> literally babysitting
[2:14:35] <Daniel_Is_I> DOWN
[2:14:38] <niozonbi> Two options
[2:14:38] <Solidnick18> down
[2:14:39] <SixthSun2> Speedrunner just skip this section Jebaited
[2:14:39] <+Huttersson> Yeah it is the worst part of TYD.
[2:14:40] <The_Maddness> @WoolieVersus Everyone agrees, the puni mechanic is jank and awful. Its a known thing
[2:14:40] <GenericSoda> down i think
[2:14:40] <skyheys> they do
[2:14:41] <exnuart> objectively the worst part of the game
[2:14:42] <%SvenHolgersson> Speedruners actually skip like all of this Reggie
[2:14:45] <hzealot> @woolieversus speedrunnwrs skip to chapter 5 I think
[2:14:49] <+GiantRatThatMakesTheRulz> walking in a circle helps me out with keeping them together
[2:14:50] <%dollarstored> speed runners literally skip most the game
[2:14:50] <insaneintentionsyo> done
[2:14:51] <crossing_mao> These guys could learn something from the pikmin
[2:14:53] <bbblaketwitching> this is the worst part of the game
[2:14:53] <paris750000> I think this chapter is skipped in speedruns
[2:14:54] <Daniel_Is_I> We did it
[2:14:54] <Solidnick18> WOOO
[2:14:56] <%heartlesshealer> he did it yay
[2:14:58] <%hawk_rush> chapter 2, 3 and 4 are slogs for speedrunners
[2:14:58] <TeethMuncher> WE DID IIT
[2:14:59] <+TheDyingPride> WE DID IT
[2:14:59] <Snakes_dk> yay

[2:15:03] <Bguy32> It's a known shitty part but you kinda made it worse as well
[2:15:06] <sirmcslushers> Funny thing is, this is prob the worst part of the game. Doesn't get any worse from here, in my own opinion.
[2:15:07] <%dinnydanny777> How could this happen to me
[2:15:07] <$Superdandy96> We did it lytBODIED lytBODIED lytBODIED

[2:15:17] <%heartlesshealer> please save, dear god
[2:15:19] <Papa_Bearman> One thing I can't stand is when an LPer plays a *bad* game (not this one), does something screwy, and then blames the game because it's bad. Like, no, the game's bad enough without you making shit up.

[2:58:01] <+Lawxy> Quick Swap is a scam
[2:58:02] <+notkojima> GET BLOWN FOOLS
[2:58:03] <bbblaketwitching> functional to be sure
[2:58:11] <niozonbi> Diminishing returns
[2:58:16] <+AsinPersuasion> quick swap is amazing for turn economy
[2:58:27] <+Lawxy> You save half of a turn for 7bp
[2:58:33] <%shoutofthehobo> Flurrie be thicc
[2:58:34] <+linSP> Yeah grinding is not worth now
[2:58:43] <%RedoctoberWolf> power bounce does big damage with the new boots
[2:58:43] <InXplotch> holy jesus hes already at 21 bp?
[2:58:44] <%hawk_rush> power jump is good to ahve!
[2:58:46] <Daniel_Is_I> Spin Jump is just Power Jump for free

[3:00:55] <KityLinn> rule 63 cloud
[3:01:00] <%lewdskeletor13> She‚Äôs like a wind spirit? Or something
[3:01:03] <%DensityD> if she was a ghsot, she would have fangs and a tongue. that's the identifier of the ghost race
[3:01:04] <niozonbi> Search her room
[3:01:04] <%SvenHolgersson> She's like the boswer to the clouds koopa
[3:01:06] <Louie_Salmon> Wind spirit is just a fancy way of saying cloud
[3:01:12] <+TheDyingPride> Can we talk about the fact that anyone that decides to help Mario obtain's Mario's curses
[3:01:13] <bbblaketwitching> is there a panel in her room?
[3:01:19] <+pectusumbra> Look up Lady Bow
[3:01:21] <niozonbi> Thick boo
[3:01:21] <Papa_Bearman> She's a cloud - she has wind poers.
[3:01:22] <Papa_Bearman> *powers
[3:01:24] <%SirGO0SE> Kreygasm
[3:01:24] <%ozmon> Oh yeah, I guess you could consider Flurrie being a Huff Puff
[3:01:24] <%SvenHolgersson> Boos got a certain look
[3:01:24] <%YakumoYomi> Cloud titties
[3:01:27] <%p4ntless> big ol' cloud cans
[3:01:27] <TeethMuncher> Barely legal boos are in your area
[3:01:28] <imnoobpepesad> lost Kreygasm
[3:01:30] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Walk into to her to check if she's REALLY a cloud
[3:01:32] <irregularly_irregular> Boos don't have shoulders like that, I don't think.
[3:01:33] <+CromotusZer0> But why tits?
[3:01:34] <Mr_Mushie> thats the first game
[3:01:40] <niozonbi> makes sense
[3:01:41] <%ringabal> Because she's an actress
[3:01:41] <%ozmon> It took me a while to realize Watt was a Sparky
[3:01:41] <GHouseduivel> @CromotusZer0 Why not?
[3:01:42] <Louie_Salmon> More
[3:01:48] <%heartlesshealer> Flurrie was never a ghost
[3:01:51] <Magoloso> Paper Mario 64 has a cute boo as a partner and she is THE BEST WAIFU

[3:02:12] <sirmcslushers> Also that
[3:02:12] <benbag13> tattle
[3:02:12] <%ringabal> Bow is an oujou-sama. Need I say more?
[3:02:14] <bbblaketwitching> a POW is just a quake hammer in item form
[3:02:17] <%heartlesshealer> bye house
[3:02:18] <%Ancopro> FP is more valuable than items, so saving items is not more important
[3:02:18] <+CromotusZer0> I felt like she just has em for no other reason other than to ensure that she is indeed a woman lol.
[3:02:19] <%DensityD> syrup syrup syrup
[3:02:19] <+TheDyingPride> You build up items much faster though
[3:02:19] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> tattle
[3:02:19] <Daniel_Is_I> Lady Bow is best girl

[3:35:10] <bbblaketwitching> MUAHAHAJA
[3:35:10] <Daniel_Is_I> It's kinda sad that Woolie already gave Bowser the Hulk Hogan voice considering THE RAWK.
[3:35:10] <benbag13> tattle on the boo parlour
[3:35:13] <%Ancopro> boggly woods is OVER
[3:35:21] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah not the best
[3:35:22] <niozonbi> Worst dungeon by far
[3:35:23] <+Dimfish> chapter 2 definitely sucks
[3:35:23] <%krispen_wa> Woolie SEETHING
[3:35:27] <%Proxzo> Boggly woods is pretty bad
[3:35:27] <Drusain> Legit Ch2 kinda sucks but it's over
[3:35:30] <niozonbi> Lowest point in the LP
[3:35:32] <DopeyDragon> not a great chapter
[3:35:33] <Bguy32> Most of the blame on yourself
[3:35:35] <niozonbi> Not your fault
[3:35:38] <The_Maddness> @WoolieVersus Boggly Woods is one of the worst chapter in the whole game
[3:35:38] <+marumariball> its the worst chapter in the game
[3:35:39] <%Superbro64> When I played this game as a child, I vaguely remember HATING that section
[3:35:40] <%dinnydanny777> jank
[3:35:40] <Bguy32> Like 80%
[3:35:41] <%DappercatEsquire> "works fine for me"
[3:35:41] <+Euphbugg> Weakest part is done, Best next
[3:35:41] <%hawk_rush> it was janky, yeah
[3:35:42] <%SirGO0SE> works for me :)
[3:35:42] <%Superbro64> you're all good woolie
[3:35:45] <%vectorless_peon> almost all uphill from here
[3:35:46] <GypsyMagi> chapter 3 makes chapter 2 worth it
[3:35:47] <+ItsDrwOk> Worst chapter @woolieversus
[3:35:47] <%RichochetForce> Yeah, Chapter 2 has bad writing, bad gameplay, bad pacing.
[3:35:48] <+UnderageBat> its fine Woolie
[3:35:52] <niozonbi> it's fine
[3:35:56] <derap41> It also happened several times
[3:35:57] <Bguy32> I have played the game 14 times and that never happened to me
[3:35:57] <bbblaketwitching> ignore mechanism, blow through walls
[3:36:01] <niozonbi> It's the worst chapter
[3:36:05] <%Ancopro> the jank happened to me but there wasnt a stream too Kappa
[3:36:07] <Bguy32> Nah just leave the cage though
[3:36:13] <%SvenHolgersson> The Puni section is definitely the Stone Ocean of TTYD
[3:36:16] <bbblaketwitching> yes
[3:36:18] <+Â§©‰Ωø42199> it gets way better in chapter 3
[3:36:23] <%GrassCannon> Chat are trolls
[3:36:27] <%RedoctoberWolf> its a tricky chapter to listen to chat
[3:36:27] <+Zenryoku21> it's a stressful part due to the tediousness of the design
[3:36:29] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah definitely
[3:36:31] <@akuda_bar> @WoolieVersus you came up with a weird alternative solution to the puzzle, was the issue
[3:36:33] <%Proxzo> ONE GUY
[3:36:35] <Bguy32> One Guy
[3:36:36] <penitentpentwitch> Chat so easily betrays itself
[3:36:39] <%eanscrale> buh wai doh
[3:36:40] <+pectusumbra> yeah, its' the weaker chapter
[3:36:40] <Robot_Nixon_> twitch chat in a nutshell
[3:36:42] <%starzo0> follow your gut first, its funnier that way
[3:36:43] <%krispen_wa> BETRAYAL
[3:36:43] <The_Maddness> @SvenHolgersson Nah, Punis arent eh second best chapter
[3:36:54] <bbblaketwitching> HELLO
[3:36:58] <bbblaketwitching> IT IS I
[3:37:00] <%oda_flobunaga> @WoolieVersus Hey Woolie, if you are still interested in gwent but want a single player experience, you should try Thronebreaker, the single player version of the game you played. Its unbalanced in all the best ways.
[3:37:01] <+mack_eye> this game's overall good, but it's got some bad chapters.
[3:37:02] <bbblaketwitching> JUAN
[3:37:04] <%gatorafan> and Woolie thought this wasn't Dokapon daedra1DerpyTibs
[3:37:08] <%hawk_rush> yeah, that weird solution did not help you at all
[3:37:09] <%SirGO0SE> STRIKE
[3:37:11] <%krispen_wa> Huang Gai
[3:37:27] <penitentpentwitch> Gundum Musou?
[3:37:32] <townzzzzz> battle assault 2
[3:37:35] <%chiluzza> yo that sounds hype
[3:37:43] <Robot_Nixon_> could make people more tempted to backseat by banning them immediately, lord Aris spares no one
[3:37:46] <benbag13> can you tattle the parlour boo?
[3:37:49] <+TheOneCalledRock> i played maxi boost on, it got a ps4 demo and its FUN
[3:37:50] <Bguy32> Thanks for the amazing Stream Woolz. Chapter 2 is universally considered the worst chapter in the game. It's all uphill from here though!
[3:37:50] <Robot_Nixon_> less tempted I mean
[3:37:51] <%prime_name> Thank goodness.
[3:37:51] <Daniel_Is_I> Never Forget Three Houses
[3:37:56] <%hawk_rush> @benbag13 yep!
[3:37:57] <%TomFrank> the age of dark
[3:37:58] <The_Maddness> We need to get darker
[3:37:59] <%krispen_wa> At the end of the Age of Fire is the Age of Dark
[3:38:01] <Rhinoprotoss> Never forget weapon triangle
[3:38:01] <%suitangi021> Battle operation is bad gaccha hell
[3:38:01] <bbblaketwitching> @benbag13 they did
[3:38:01] <DopeyDragon> PLEASE
[3:38:05] <+Â§©‰Ωø42199> Three Houses Kreygasm
[3:38:06] <%starzo0> the troubles
[3:38:13] <+Â§©‰Ωø42199> the golden age
[3:38:16] <Louie_Salmon> Good times
[3:38:19] <%prime_name> New Age is Good Age
[3:38:20] <+Â§©‰Ωø42199> sacrifice huh
[3:38:39] <%Superbro64> came out with hardly any fanfare too
[3:38:40] <%RedoctoberWolf> i'll take that trade
[3:38:41] <%krispen_wa> One offs are probably just better for off-camera
[3:38:42] <+TheOneCalledRock> ninjala has a lot of new shit that was not in the beta
[3:38:45] <+TheOneCalledRock> it's kinda neat
[3:38:49] <BusterBazz> I just tried Ninjala, it's an okay game
[3:38:53] <+worldbrand> I like variety but we get that with like salt party so i'm okay
[3:38:56] <%chiluzza> god i d love to do another TF2 communitiy
[3:38:58] <%chiluzza> fight
[3:39:01] <+Mrsoulreaper42> that makes sense
[3:39:05] <+Mrsoulreaper42> but Gundammmmm
[3:39:08] <%SirGO0SE> but comooonity
[3:39:09] <+Euphbugg> sad, but makes sense
[3:39:19] <+TheOneCalledRock> you do what you gotta do
[3:39:23] <+samsarasage> You can combo people
[3:39:31] <%krispen_wa> Unless it's something hype like Dong Dong, you can't really get inside jokes and memes from one-offs
[3:39:43] <%shoutofthehobo> I see
[3:39:43] <%SvenHolgersson> Oh right Three Houses
[3:39:47] <+samsarasage> Man three houses was rough
[3:39:53] <%SvenHolgersson> That was a great time
[3:39:58] <%RedoctoberWolf> woolieFUN_TK
[3:40:06] <+Euphbugg> ...and then the angry mob appears
[3:40:08] <%zamzoph> true
[3:40:16] <%prime_name> That sounds like a good plan
[3:40:17] <%SirGO0SE> you need to talk in absolutes with fire emblem
[3:40:18] <+Â§©‰Ωø42199> smart plan
[3:40:20] <$NoWayRyanTatum> I support this choice
[3:40:20] <%Livelinne> Plague Tale LP was fun tho! PrideRise
[3:40:23] <+SuperKirby24> play teh good gem

[3:40:50] <+Â§©‰Ωø42199> so will the race wars continue next time ?
[3:40:58] <+Cavumentum> From my point of view-
[3:41:10] <+worldbrand> Wonder if one-offs might work better for shorter games? But I have nothing to complain about with this LP lineup
[3:41:10] <+paladinstarbuster> punjabis?

[0:13:19] <Enemy_In_Disguise> For real tho, when’s Vergil?

[0:16:09] <%tearfuldevil> I don't like Korra the tv show at all
[0:16:10] <Dutchpotato> Yep
[0:16:13] <+ggbhtg> Legend of Ajna Kappa
[0:16:15] <%nepwar> shouldn't known better than talking about your week woolie!
[0:16:21] <%Irridium> should've waited and hard-dropped it all like you did with Persona 3 and 4
[0:16:21] <DatAsuna> Reinstall that browser extension
[0:16:28] <DatAsuna> the keyword blocker
[0:16:28] <joylent_blue> did really enjoy the Avatar talk though, for what its worth
[0:16:33] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Desperately dodging spoilers
[0:16:35] <+trllly> Korra has a beautiful ending. I can't wait for you to see it
[0:16:35] <%ChoculaUltra> I didn't like Korra when it aired, gave it another shot and still didn't like it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[0:16:39] <%kyh9> One Guy!
[0:16:42] <%RioGascar> i can keep korra out of discussion, but its hard to avoid
[0:16:48] <%ChoculaUltra> Amon's mask was sick tho
[0:16:48] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:16:53] <%tearfuldevil> @kyh9 way more than 1 guy lol
[0:16:55] <%jiggy_snipe> One Guys always spoil
[0:16:55] <%Asuterisuku> No spoiler trolling.
[0:16:58] <@Solidus_113> Do you vaguely remember the plot of the game?
[0:17:00] <andrei11dr> I haven't even seen it
[0:17:01] <DatAsuna> THe only thing I'll say about Korra is that I wish they released the soundtrack for the seasons beyond 1
[0:17:01] <MayorRev> some people are too rude :(
[0:17:01] <YakumoYomi> You can't escape it, Woolie. Just by not saying you don't hate it, you've called down the wrath.
[0:17:03] <%harpsichord_uiy> wish the atla video quality was better but man the story holds up
[0:17:04] <%ReidTheReader> ReidTheReader subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months, currently on a 16 month streak! So what up.
[0:17:09] <Aydarkzero> let Woolie experience the show for himself
[0:17:15] <joylent_blue> One huge group of guys
[0:17:18] <DatAsuna> yeah old donation
[0:17:26] <+ggbhtg> big trutha
[0:17:32] <+ggbhtg> big truths
[0:17:33] <%jiggy_snipe> slushmusher
[0:17:39] <+lucaflowe> Woolie your face is kinda blurry
[0:17:42] <+ggbhtg> big trutha truths
[0:17:43] <DatAsuna> Yeah, don't stop explaining
[0:18:01] <+lucaflowe> Also there's a third Snowpiercer book in existence
[0:18:03] <%emperordread> You can't stop some people not getting what you're saying, because some people don't WANT to get what you're saying
[0:18:06] <%RioGascar> i wish netflix had taken a bit of work and gotten the blu ray avatar show
[0:18:08] <%NecDW4> @WoolieVersus So, is the lady who gives you the quiz in Mega Man Legends 2 a card?
[0:18:12] <%jiggy_snipe> yea always keep explaining. it's better for understanding
[0:18:17] <+trllly> What do you think about Jimmy Fallon getting cancelled over Blackface? Personally, I think it's ok as long as it's for comedic effect.
[0:18:17] <YakumoYomi> Confirmed: Woolie hates the thing!
[0:18:21] <%RioGascar> From what i heard they somewaht improved the animation quality
[0:18:27] <%nepwar> you can explain as much as you much, but some people don't have the ability to understand past what they have already believed your stance to be
[0:18:28] <%DaBigVitus> i'm grateful that i'm not a youtuber/streamer so i don't have to deal with this shit
[0:18:34] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus Also what do you want to bet that if you finish korra and enjoy it people say you only like it cause she's tan with muscle?
[0:19:06] <%NYCrownlessKing> but all Avatar girls have some sort of muscle
[0:19:07] <GenoCL> Muscle girl Kreygasm
[0:19:10] <%NYCrownlessKing> like, what?
[0:19:14] <%harpsichord_uiy> those are both valid reasons to like her
[0:19:15] <%Superbro64> cmonBruh
[0:19:18] <Aydarkzero> Royal Guard mode activate
[0:19:19] <YakumoYomi> Flame Shield at the ready!
[0:19:20] <DatAsuna> You're an influencer, flanderization is on
[0:19:20] <%jiggy_snipe> Kappa
[0:19:23] <+ggbhtg> Reminder that the internet loves to see in black and white, BEFORE you even explain anything
[0:19:25] <%Irridium> Irridium subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! 12 months. can't think of anything deep so I'll just steal from Legend of the Galactic Heroes. "Alcohol is humanities friend. Can I really abandon a friend?" - Yang Wen-Li
[0:19:26] <%Jerimoi> what if he does only like it cause muscle?
[0:19:33] <joylent_blue> there's seriously cool parts of Korra, ppl kinda forget about those parts and get caught up in the negativity
[0:19:35] <%NYCrownlessKing> they all know martial arts, they all got muscles doodStare
[0:19:37] <vVAstrAVv> its not THAAAT bad
[0:19:45] <Enemy_In_Disguise> You can enjoy a character design without enjoying the character
[0:19:49] <+BubbaRands> just dive in
[0:19:52] <%reonome> i'm still mad at nick
[0:19:55] <DatAsuna> Yeah just have fun.
[0:19:56] <%OldManDeckardCain> lack of a good writer affected the show LUL
[0:19:58] <%Superbro64> I am impressed in how much you dont like talking about shazam after watching that though
[0:20:00] <Angry_Ev1L> avatar fans are obnoxious
[0:20:06] <YakumoYomi> Korra had some hype ass fights, and I like the villain's design.
[0:20:09] <%DaBigVitus> mike from redlettermedia officially isn't telling people he's watching something until it's done.
[0:20:11] <joylent_blue> yeye, just go in
[0:20:13] <+ggbhtg> _____ fans are obnoxious
[0:20:13] <%jiggy_snipe> ok guys stop talking about Korra whether its good or bad
[0:20:15] <DatAsuna> No need to revisit the game for antying but it's gameplay though
[0:20:18] <GarbageNirvana> Mira has a nice design at least
[0:20:21] <venomfury86> @enemy_in_disguise like Dante in DMC2
[0:20:23] <GarbageNirvana> but yeah
[0:20:31] <%goodfeila> woolieF woolieU
[0:20:36] <%reonome> i'm happy you're finally watching avatar at least
[0:20:36] <%tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus and also @chatpeoplewhoplayTeppen Is there an advantage to playing Teppen in an android emulator, or on a higher performance phone, in regards to the real time portion of the game?
[0:20:39] <%RioGascar> @woolieversus how are you planning on watching korra anyway? I did a rewatch of the previous series and got to korra but amazon video only has s1-2. no streaming service far as i can find has s3 or s4
[0:20:40] <extradopeness> Korra is rad I like that show
[0:20:40] <+ScarletteOScare> not gonna lie i was like that with undertale for the same reason
[0:20:55] <%SomersaultJustice> what happened to reggie?
[0:21:03] <Mayachacha> hopefully reggie does not have the C?
[0:21:04] <DatAsuna> nice
[0:21:06] <joylent_blue> get well soon reggie BibleThump
[0:21:09] <%Superbro64> @woolieversus did you see that people are trying to get rollback into dbfz
[0:21:10] <YakumoYomi> Reggie's Devil Gene has started to awaken
[0:21:20] <%tearfuldevil> being sicck or tired = / = having the c
[0:21:25] <%Superbro64> not gonna happen, but I appreciate that they know its brome
[0:21:25] <%goodfeila> Oh no Reggie! BibleThump
[0:21:27] <%emperordread> Punished Reggie woolieREGGIEFUL
[0:21:29] <%Superbro64> *broke
[0:21:32] <%NecDW4> You can't trick us. He's dying isnt he?!?!?!
[0:21:36] <joylent_blue> that's totally understandable
[0:21:39] <+BubbaRands> Overloaded on Dehbil Gehmes!
[0:21:45] <%reonome> StS is SO GOOD
[0:21:45] <+konekoryugamine> Okay, I kust downloaded Teppen.
[0:21:46] <%laserbeaming> Also, is Teppen the only card game with absolutely no twitch viewership? That's weird
[0:21:48] <%harpsichord_uiy> Reggie gotta charge up on that phone charger
[0:21:52] <Mayachacha> well, i mean, amidst world pandemic its not a stretch to wonder if it is indeed it...
[0:21:54] <%nepwar> get into fighting card games
[0:21:59] <@Menitta> the deckbuilding of Slay the Spire inspired One Step From Eden
[0:22:01] <%RioGascar> its getting rough with the super hot heat.
[0:22:03] <+lucaflowe> So when is Woolie vs Duel Links?
[0:22:05] <%Javaa01> These skills are definitely transferable though
[0:22:06] <%NYCrownlessKing> its hard to stream @laserbeaming
[0:22:07] <+konekoryugamine> HI MENITTA!
[0:22:10] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Slay the Spire is cool
[0:22:12] <@Menitta> HI
[0:22:13] <$legacy0117> Slay the Spire is so dang difficult.
[0:22:14] <+JoeCoolMaverick> Yeah, I understand. I've been...off myself the last week/week-and-a-half.
[0:22:16] <YakumoYomi> I get ya. Monster Hunter was the only reason I picked up MvC Infinite (and on sale, no less).
[0:22:18] <+ggbhtg> No Woolie, you HAVE to start playing Yugioh Duel Links NOOOOW
[0:22:26] <%reonome> eden straight up ripped off some StS cards LUL
[0:22:29] <%Superbro64> is slay the spire cooler then bookworm adventures tho? Kappa
[0:22:30] <Diablo169> Hey Woolie, you mentioned Commandos yesterday. Have you seen Shadow Tactics blade sof the shogun?
[0:22:35] <+trllly> The other day I went to put in my headphones and I didn't realize the podcast was playing and all I hear was "and then _____ gets stabbed" and was instantly spoiled on FF7 remake....
[0:22:38] <%Superbro64> its like scrabble but a video game
[0:22:45] <+Jasuchin> UFS is such a fun TCG for Fighting Game fans, it's just not as big as it should be
[0:22:47] <%vextalyst> cheer500 Yo woolie I really really feel you on the third person thing. But man do you get toxicity from that opinion. I really would like a 3rd person option for destiny but just mentioning wanting the OPTION for it in PVE only gets you so much vitriol It's insane. Que the "hey just deal with 1st person" dumbass
[0:23:00] <joylent_blue> i wanna get back into Teppen AND MonHun NotLikeThis but there's NO TIMEEEE
[0:23:04] <kam154154> woolieU
[0:23:19] <+BubbaRands> Yeah Play Duel Links...Egyptian God Cards...Gate Guardian...Winged Kuriboh ResidentSleeper
[0:23:19] <%ChoculaUltra> I can't believe Overlord Rico Sr was actually the King the whole time Kappa
[0:23:25] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus You take your time dude, read what people paid for.
[0:23:28] <Aydarkzero> always saw Woolie as an Earthbender
[0:23:33] <+ggbhtg> I am Bender, please insert girder
[0:23:34] <%arcielardor> cheer500 Hey Woolie. Love watching you because you have this pure energy about the things you love. Speaking of which, I have you to also thank for my current enjoyment of Wonderful 101. Never let that energy fade.
[0:23:34] <redrins> if people ask you to hurry up and play the game, you should just take longer reading messages
[0:23:38] <%Superbro64> its all good doodGood
[0:23:39] <%jiggy_snipe> earthbender probably

[0:23:47] <GarbageNirvana> Trashbender
[0:23:47] <%laserbeaming> Blud
[0:23:48] <%reonome> of course woolie choses the OP bending LUL
[0:23:49] <joylent_blue> bloodbending is radical
[0:23:49] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:23:50] <%nepwar> woolie would def be a bloodbender.. for the wrong reasons
[0:23:54] <%DaBigVitus> cum bender
[0:23:55] <%tearfuldevil> remember when you could only bloodbend under the full moon? i do
[0:23:55] <+Ancopro> even if it looks SUPER evil
[0:23:56] <%Irridium> I mean blood bending could have some real good uses for medical purposes
[0:23:57] <ficboyog> you kinda blurry my man @WoolieVersus
[0:23:57] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @ggbhtg
[0:23:58] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus How far have you gotten in Korra?

[0:24:04] <%laserbeaming> It is super evil regardless, you just have to live with it
[0:24:04] <%jiggy_snipe> Trashbender Woolie LUL
[0:24:05] <Mayachacha> i bend blood every month lol
[0:24:05] <%RioGascar> How are there right reasons for blood bending
[0:24:10] <+Jasuchin> Give the villain an anneurysm
[0:24:12] <%Superbro64> "I want to be a GREY jedi" :)
[0:24:13] <%nepwar> bloodbend people to buying the n pass
[0:24:19] <MacHeath> water into ice and blood
[0:24:20] <%kyh9> Violate the Geneva Convention for good
[0:24:21] <joylent_blue> trllly shhhhh no spoils
[0:24:21] <%harpsichord_uiy> all these specs are wild
[0:24:21] <%tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus and also @chatpeoplewhoplayTeppen Is there an advantage to playing Teppen in an phone emulator, or on a higher performance phone, in regards to the real time portion of the game?
[0:24:22] <%JustYudha> What's air bending special?
[0:24:24] <ToxInjection> Spin the roulette wheel, boys!
[0:24:25] <Aydarkzero> look at these Class Jobs!
[0:24:25] <%Jerimoi> i just want a persona

[0:24:50] <%kyh9> WHAT?!
[0:24:51] <%RioGascar> And then theres sokka with the boomerang
[0:24:53] <$legacy0117> Blood bending could be used to heal or remove poison...Can't think how else to use it for good.
[0:24:59] <+ggbhtg> Excuse?
[0:24:59] <%DaBigVitus> haven't seen avatar shows. can't you just take peoples breath with airbending
[0:25:00] <koolaid_kevster> @karn_ex you can say that again
[0:25:08] <joylent_blue> OKAMI
[0:25:08] <%kyh9> WITH A SLLOW DOWN MECHANIC?!
[0:25:09] <%emperordread> Issun
[0:25:10] <%tearfuldevil> god i hate how bloodbending in korra became just a straight power upgrade isntead of a cool horror thing with ritualistic restrictions
[0:25:11] <%nepwar> beware the smegabenders
[0:25:14] <SenhorGordon> With water bending you can avoid pregnancy 100% Kappa
[0:25:19] <%kyh9> Have Viewtiful Joe with a speed-up or slow-down mechanic
[0:25:20] <joylent_blue> Okami, Phoenix Wright
[0:25:26] <+Karn_EX> They got Ace Attorney in there yet?
[0:25:29] <+Jasuchin> HENSHIN A GO-GO, BABEEEE! limesLUL
[0:25:32] <%Superbro64> Wasn't dough bending a thing in an avatar thing? I remember it being in a comic or something
[0:25:35] <%ChoculaUltra> Playable Jester would be hilarious
[0:25:45] <Aydarkzero> oof
[0:25:46] <%kapcommunist> sup!
[0:25:47] <%Superbro64> You know what? I remember, there was a fan design competition
[0:25:51] <venomfury86> Mundus
[0:25:59] <%harpsichord_uiy> I keep getting Bamco can Capcom mascots mixed up, almost suggested PacMan or Klonoa in Teppen
[0:25:59] <+ggbhtg> Big F
[0:26:06] <Aydarkzero> embrace the Wi-Fi stank
[0:26:07] <%nepwar> big oof
[0:26:07] <%ozzrabbit> Can we get the Wonderful 101 in teppen?

[0:26:12] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Donte for Teppen Kappa
[0:26:15] <%emperordread> Red bar gotta go home bro, sorry
[0:26:16] <%JustYudha> RIP
[0:26:20] <@Menitta> I wonder if a USB ethernet adapter would fix that on PS4
[0:26:23] <%laserbeaming> Get a PC, play Them's Fightin' Herds
[0:26:27] <MayorRev> BibleThump
[0:26:32] <no_johns_justin> usb to ethernat?
[0:26:32] <ToxInjection> psaBig F :(
[0:26:39] <%Javaa01> Yeah, if you don't know a friend or a friend of a friend who knows how to solder then you're SOL
[0:26:44] <%RioGascar> It possibly could fix with a usb ethernet adaptor
[0:26:44] <Aydarkzero> it's worth a try there's a usb port on the back afterall
[0:27:00] <@Menitta> Worth a try at least
[0:27:02] <+ggbhtg> That's a good line
[0:27:03] <redrins> yang wen lee notable alcoholic
[0:27:10] <+BubbaRands> Space Shikamaru LUL
[0:27:11] <+ggbhtg> That's a good ass line
[0:27:18] <derap41> Oh god no TEPPEN
[0:27:26] <DatAsuna> I'm with ya on that
[0:27:28] <%DaBigVitus> Hey woolie, i wanna know what brand of whiskey you guys drank at the end of dokapon`.
[0:27:30] <+ggbhtg> Just 4Head
[0:27:31] <Aydarkzero> just adapt 4Head
[0:27:32] <DatAsuna> I wish deus ex was third person
[0:27:45] <%Superbro64> 4Head
[0:27:46] <DatAsuna> I wish ghost in the shell had a deus ex clone lol
[0:27:52] <+LastHazzerd> Deus Ex 3rd person would be fun
[0:27:53] <%RioGascar> like old deus ex?
[0:28:00] <Aydarkzero> man seeing that Overwatch 3rd Person gameplay made me feel sad it looks so much better
[0:28:04] <%nepwar> im plaing mankind divided again, and a 3rd person option would be fun as heck
[0:28:04] <@Solidus_113> Star Wars Battlefront did it fine. Regular game was FPS, but all hero play was 3rd person
[0:28:05] <derap41> There a few good third person multi player shooters
[0:28:05] <+LastHazzerd> if only that exists
[0:28:06] <%RioGascar> old deus ex 3rd person would look weirdddd
[0:28:06] <%tearfuldevil> the LOGH novels were better than the anime, but even they still have problems with ignoring the core attributes of democracy as _rule of the people_ instead of _rule of civilians_ when comparing it with facism
[0:28:08] <%Superbro64> fuck options, we all should have the same thing :)
[0:28:12] <Agami23> theres alot of games that would be great with a third person mode.
[0:28:17] <@Menitta> I don't like how Deus Ex switches back and forth
[0:28:18] <DatAsuna> Well they make all those third person animations anyway
[0:28:28] <+Risingxiv> I never cared for anything in Overwatch but that 3rd person gamplay made me want to give it a try
[0:28:31] <+aishman> Unite MORPH
[0:28:32] <@Menitta> TEAM
[0:28:35] <@Menitta> UNITE UP
[0:28:35] <lotharrio> Oh that's right. It's getting a re-release isn't it?
[0:28:37] <joylent_blue> 1st person games will always feel worse to play to me
[0:28:45] <+Karn_EX> Third person Tekken 7>>>> Kappa
[0:28:47] <+aishman> @lotharrio It DID, it's already out
[0:28:53] <@Menitta> could you imagine W101 in first person
[0:28:53] <+ggbhtg> 101 is out NOOOOOW
[0:28:56] <GenoCL> Finally on platforms people actually own Kappa
[0:29:00] <extradopeness> Yeah I definitely bought W101
[0:29:02] <+ggbhtg> BUY IT.
[0:29:06] <derap41> Anamo?
[0:29:11] <%tearfuldevil> that sounds so tired
[0:29:14] <%Superbro64> bayonetta is in the game too Kappa

[0:29:31] <%tearfuldevil> i love star wars
[0:29:32] <okramv> what's the topic
[0:29:37] <%tearfuldevil> the writing was pretty okay
[0:29:37] <joylent_blue> same woolie LUL
[0:29:40] <%ChoculaUltra> huttball was p lit

[0:29:45] <%nepwar> i just wanna see a live reaction to woolie watching a raid in action LUL
[0:29:46] <@Solidus_113> Yo... *Versus?*
[0:29:46] <+ggbhtg> Just roll for dailies yo 4Head
[0:29:47] <%tearfuldevil> but the aestehticc, and the gameplay is jsut not for me
[0:29:48] <bravedjohnny> @WoolieVersus you can play paladins in 3rd and 1st person
[0:29:51] <+LastHazzerd> Abilities are just moves on a move list
[0:29:53] <+Jasuchin> SWTOR has some AMAZING story at least. Gameplaywise, it's just WoW but with lightsabers
[0:29:53] <redrins> we'll get you playing xiv and weaving one of these days
[0:29:55] <+BubbaRands> Woolie Goblins? LUL
[0:29:55] <%ChoculaUltra> and you can do all the raids solo with npcs from the story filling the roster
[0:29:58] <DatAsuna> Like I said it ain't for woolie, but it's a whole thing
[0:30:04] <ficboyog> you kinda blurry my man @WoolieVersus
[0:30:06] <1matheuw> the opposite of woolie bait:woolie repelent
[0:30:10] <%ChoculaUltra> but its still an mmo ass mmo
[0:30:11] <%Superbro64> are people who play mmos humans? I dont think so. I'm one of them.
[0:30:14] <SenhorGordon> Woolz have you ever thought about trying Dungeon Fighter?
[0:30:17] <DatAsuna> Personally I love dueling as a tank
[0:30:17] <%RioGascar> I mean raiding used to mean pillage a town for its supplies. It WAS cool
[0:30:19] <%DaBigVitus> i just want Star Trek to get it's version of kotor style game
[0:30:20] <+ggbhtg> Woolie Ward

[0:31:45] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus So what I'm hearing is, Woolie Vs FF14 (featuring Peach Saliva)
[0:31:50] <Fanciful_Unicorn> Its was just when you were zoomed in

[0:35:50] <%tearfuldevil> i cannot tell whats happening lol
[0:35:53] <joylent_blue> damn nice
[0:35:55] <Aydarkzero> bounced Juri LUL
[0:36:18] <+LastHazzerd> it's amazing how putting emphasis on "fighting" instead of "for" improves that line so much
[0:36:24] <%TrafficCohen> Juri ain't so bouncy
[0:36:27] <%TrafficCohen> Not like Laura
[0:36:34] <joylent_blue> PogChamp
[0:36:35] <%optimasmaximas> nice

[0:37:32] <%Shishi1205> @WoolieVersus Don't know if they have told you already (or even if you care) but the next Teppen hero is going to be a Felyne (palico).

[0:37:48] <+ggbhtg> LOCK out! @woolieversus
[0:37:52] <$legacy0117> So your deck is basically countdown deck. Which you collect cards or let turns pass to build up to an event. Nice job. ^^
[0:37:52] <joylent_blue> Nero BibleThump
[0:37:52] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule

[0:38:29] <Bluewolf544> This is like a JOJO battle
[0:38:31] <%DaBigVitus> never played a card game but want to try that KOF one
[0:38:35] <extradopeness> This shit goes crazy
[0:38:36] <Aydarkzero> yeah looks like when you bounced Juri back to the deck you had it under control
[0:38:38] <%optimasmaximas> monkaS
[0:38:53] <andrei11dr> As a kid i totally thought Zero was a chick
[0:39:12] <+konekoryugamine> Was it the hair?
[0:39:15] <+LastHazzerd> long hair, don't care
[0:39:16] <+Loinclothiclese> how?
[0:39:18] <joylent_blue> black Rath monkaS
[0:39:25] <%DaBigVitus> the green pasties maybe
[0:39:27] <%MattDemers> I enjoy how there's a "what am I fighting forrrr" card.
[0:39:28] <venomfury86> @andrei11dr i can see why :)
[0:39:37] <andrei11dr> They didn't have fucking voices on the SNES
[0:39:38] <Bluewolf544> @LastHazzerd A man of culture
[0:39:40] <+Jasuchin> Gotta BURN the zombie, dude
[0:39:42] <+konekoryugamine> @mattdemers ARE YOU SERIOUS? XD
[0:39:43] <%laserbeaming> So... is Woolie playing the equivalent of MtG Blue Control?
[0:39:52] <%MattDemers> @konekoryugamine Look at the first card in his order.
[0:39:54] <joylent_blue> V PogChamp

[0:40:46] <+konekoryugamine> WHAT AM I FIGHTING FOR??!?!?!
[0:40:52] <+Jasuchin> They made a card of Iris dying. Because she does nothing else in the series, apparently :P
[0:41:22] <joylent_blue> BARBEQUE TIMEEEEE
[0:41:24] <+terry_quest> appreciate the effort of explaining the play
[0:41:26] <Aydarkzero> V has come to
[0:41:29] <andrei11dr> Not using the "I'll find my own destiny" thing huh
[0:41:32] <+terry_quest> watching people play card games is rough
[0:41:32] <%nepwar> goddamn V
[0:41:38] <Bluewolf544> Wait who was that chick holding the card i cant remember
[0:41:47] <%jiggy_snipe> Rose?
[0:42:00] <Aydarkzero> it was Rose
[0:42:22] <+konekoryugamine> DON'T FUCK UP!
[0:42:24] <$legacy0117> So is this Zero infected with the Maverick virus? Or is X? No idea.
[0:42:25] <Bluewolf544> i knew i recognized her
[0:42:28] <Aydarkzero> play Mirror Force quick monkaS

[0:42:54] <$legacy0117> Oof, rough.
[0:43:07] <Aydarkzero> yep Zero's life is not an easy one
[0:43:15] <DatAsuna> use pot of greed
[0:43:20] <Bluewolf544> This is like the narrator arc from hxh
[0:43:21] <KiraKamixephos> Have you tried the zero black deck @woolieversus
[0:43:34] <%TrafficCohen> I use Pot of Greed, which allows me to draw 2 more cards
[0:43:41] <Fanciful_Unicorn> F
[0:43:42] <+LastHazzerd> Boy i don't know megaman lore after sigma gets introduced

[0:44:06] <%scrublord009> I love Teppen. I uninstalled it because it always crashes after 1 match. Playing Runeterra, super fun. Also, turns are more my thing
[0:44:08] <%laserbeaming> I'm guessing you got Mid-Ranged to death?
[0:44:10] <joylent_blue> rath WINNING?
[0:44:14] <+UnderseaMagic> mtg player here, looks like this is a control deck?
[0:44:17] <%jiggy_snipe> who knew Woolie's N-Passes transcend space and time
[0:44:33] <ELJOVENBATALI> Nero has an N-word pass
[0:44:34] <andrei11dr> There it totally a luck element
[0:44:36] <%laserbeaming> @UnderseaMagic I think it's control, but I am also confused
[0:44:37] <%Shishi1205> That's Dreadking for you
[0:44:39] <%TrafficCohen> Is Rath a rush/burn deck?
[0:44:41] <joylent_blue> Purple in Teppen is comparable to blue in MtG yeah

[0:45:03] <+LastHazzerd> iiiris!
[0:45:03] <%sjay449> Is that the true power of "Bring me the Horizon?" Transcend space and time to enable casual racism?

[0:47:21] <%DaBigVitus> do one with no talking so we can see woolie with limiters off
[0:47:23] <$legacy0117> So, this game is more about card combinations? It seems the battles do not last too long.
[0:47:28] <Fanciful_Unicorn> I have no idea what is going on here
[0:47:30] <%TrafficCohen> Is Megaman.EXE a hero?

[1:15:19] <notgarza> Aye, Kenny's here
[1:15:21] <joylent_blue> nope MayorRev, i think maybe you don't get any experience for the hero you're playing, but that's not a big deal at all

[1:16:25] <MayorRev> PogChamp
[1:16:30] <%Ashenik1> I have no idea what is going on but I enojyed so
[1:16:30] <joylent_blue> Woolie finally picked that top tier Kappa
[1:16:32] <bentarcher> he had you if he just used that divebomb
[1:16:34] <$legacy0117> You got up there man!
[1:16:38] <MayorRev> Kenny challenging you!
[1:16:38] <$legacy0117> Nice
[1:16:39] <MasterTonberry23> As someone who recently started playing card games, whatever works, just freaking use it, the other guys certainly will :P
[1:16:47] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Just pick a top tier
[1:16:57] <%PulsinFufu> inochiDerp dual color decks dont have a chance against full x hunters so little MP to deal vs all of them
[1:17:14] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Because memes
[1:17:15] <KiraKamixephos> Those are both purple cards
[1:17:39] <@UnRooolie> Yeah but that’s purple decks
[1:18:03] <$legacy0117> I kinda expected Zero to be a Red type hero, rather than Purple type, but infected so eh.
[1:18:04] <%PulsinFufu> yeah pruple are the only with negate cards inochiThink black have 3 board wipes tho
[1:18:12] <RAH001> i thought u said ' Ada Wrong" lol the bad ada from re6
[1:18:12] <bentarcher> I've only beaten x hunters twice, so rough that it's a play card win late game match
[1:18:38] <+TheDankDemon> card game meta NotLikeThis
[1:18:41] <+LastHazzerd> colors!?
[1:18:46] <+LastHazzerd> like Magic??
[1:18:51] <MayorRev> Kenny wants to play acouple rounds with ya
[1:18:52] <$legacy0117> YEP.
[1:18:52] <@UnRooolie> Yoo
[1:18:57] <%nepwar> mix the colors to win
[1:19:01] <%NYCrownlessKing> challenge kenny, call em a scrub @WoolieVersus
[1:19:03] <@UnRooolie> Chilling about to play this MK
[1:19:04] <MasterTonberry23> We're gonna get a new expansion soon to shake up the meta anyway
[1:19:07] <+BakaKaitoKun> https://clips.twitch.tv/DarlingHilariousSpindlePhilosoraptor
[1:19:08] <%arcielardor> For some reason it wouldn't let me make a hybrid deck when I was just starting out
[1:19:13] <KiraKamixephos> Red burnnnn
[1:19:14] <+LastHazzerd> ooooo, okay.
[1:19:22] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I’m too smallbrain to mix cards, gotta have singular colors
[1:19:33] <%laserbeaming> Red = Burn, Purple = Control?
[1:19:46] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Purple is deck/field manipulation
[1:19:51] <DatAsuna> give me back my BB
[1:19:55] <+TheDankDemon> so magic like
[1:19:56] <%RioGascar> What do you think of teppens art style? Personally some characters i think it looks really ugly on
[1:19:57] <%nawji> black is reanimator
[1:19:57] <%PulsinFufu> and destroying doodSwear
[1:20:01] <redrins> green is ramp
[1:20:01] <%Wonderbot3000> Black is risk reward
[1:20:03] <%nawji> I like these MTG terms, makes it easy to digest
[1:20:04] <CMy2j4EVER> Play resonate x
[1:20:04] <abbock> green is BUFF YA BOYS
[1:20:04] <arkv01> we MTG?
[1:20:05] <%NYCrownlessKing> Risk/Reward aka lose life or units = Black
[1:20:06] <+LastHazzerd> wow, so they're actually schools of strategy,
[1:20:06] <KiraKamixephos> Black is destroy/rev/sacrifice
[1:20:11] <$legacy0117> ZOMBIES
[1:20:15] <%NYCrownlessKing> Purple = control the pace or control the board
[1:20:22] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Restore/shield
[1:20:23] <%PulsinFufu> green is buff and seal mostly
[1:20:26] <%NYCrownlessKing> Red = damage one enemy hard, or split damage on the field
[1:20:26] <$legacy0117> Blue?
[1:20:32] <%NYCrownlessKing> green = heal/shields
[1:20:32] <joylent_blue> arcielardor dual color decks will halve your MP available, so if you had more expensive cards it won't let you create that deck
[1:20:34] <MayorRev> ohhh nero's art is lovely
[1:20:46] <MayorRev> guile!
[1:20:46] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:20:52] <+LastHazzerd> game aside, shout outs to the artists
[1:20:58] <%NYCrownlessKing> challenge kenny, call em a scrub @WoolieVersus
[1:21:01] <%NYCrownlessKing> doodKen
[1:21:06] <MayorRev> fight kenny!
[1:21:07] <joylent_blue> all the DMC art is fantastic
[1:21:12] <KiraKamixephos> I prefer the black/purple Zero deck
[1:21:13] <+Davos_Southway> @WoolieVersus Just wanna say, love the way you carry yourself and how you do it. Learned about the group though the podcast and I've been a silent supporter of your guy's since. Stay golden! <3
[1:21:14] <joylent_blue> recommend just looking the art up
[1:21:14] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Thing is, people in those archetypes have different roles
[1:21:16] <redrins> play kenny
[1:21:21] <KiraKamixephos> I’m down to play
[1:21:23] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I’m down!
[1:21:23] <%NYCrownlessKing> beat down kenny Kappa
[1:21:26] <%laserbeaming> Hey Woolie, are you familiar with the card game terms "Control", "Mid Range" and "Aggro"?
[1:21:33] <%PulsinFufu> LUL i already got my match so il let others play
[1:21:35] <redrins> kenny will go in Kappa
[1:21:35] <MayorRev> yea he said he's down
[1:21:35] <%BackwardCap> I slept on Teppen this season. No new cards and all the season pass rewards are dupes from before.
[1:21:36] <MasterTonberry23> Something I wish all card games had, is that after a match you can see your opponent's deck
[1:21:37] <$legacy0117> So no blue? I guess Blue was control in Magic.
[1:21:39] <@Menitta> I have teppen installed but...
[1:21:41] <VJdarkworld> :O
[1:21:42] <%nepwar> if only teppen was available in my region :(
[1:21:45] <treacherously_> Is this game free?
[1:21:47] <$legacy0117> So Purple
[1:21:49] <KatyBee> Where'd you get your super sick hoodie, dude?
[1:21:50] <DatAsuna> RIP dude
[1:21:54] <VJdarkworld> D:
[1:21:54] <arkv01> blue was counterspells and control
[1:21:59] <+LastHazzerd> things are turbulent
[1:22:02] <joylent_blue> treacherously_ yep, and its pretty F2P friendly as well
[1:22:04] <arkv01> so purple in teppen is blue yeah?
[1:22:11] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Yeah
[1:22:13] <DatAsuna> 2 years experience helps
[1:22:24] <treacherously_> Cool maybe I’ll try it out
[1:22:28] <%AlteisenReiseZ> But I’m down with my scrubby Nero deck
[1:22:33] <og_reesetti> og_reesetti subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:22:33] <DatAsuna> :3
[1:22:37] <treacherously_> Don’t wanna get bodied by woolie though lol
[1:22:41] <%PulsinFufu> @nepwar you can download teppen QooApp is not available in my region but i can play it cuz of that ap
[1:22:41] <@Solidus_113> Nobody's going to play SWTOR with you
[1:22:43] <+LastHazzerd> that's.... an interesting way to put it
[1:22:44] <DatAsuna> Figured yeah
[1:22:53] <zamzoph> Woolie likes to dress up Kappa
[1:23:05] <+projectmanatees> woolie is kirito Kappa
[1:23:14] <%NYCrownlessKing> Kenny might be too busy gettin rdy stream n playin mk11 @WoolieVersus
[1:23:15] <+LastHazzerd> MMOs scare me away because what other's call social "hook" i call social "pressure"
[1:23:15] <Axle13j> Glamour/style is true endgame
[1:23:22] <%nepwar> @PulsinFufu oh shit for real. ok ill check it out. hopefully i can figure it out lol
[1:23:24] <megamonmon123> if he cant fight wearing jojo underwear its a no sale
[1:23:35] <the7thdraconian> Big mood dude. I also love Dress up, but not with other peoples.
[1:23:35] <%RioGascar> I liked the sims aspect of creating a big engine and make it work
[1:23:38] <%og_reesetti> On one hand: I wanna go on an adventure. On the other: people.
[1:23:42] <treacherously_> I’m too adhd inattentive to play mmos
[1:23:45] <%RioGascar> Which city skylines is the better sim city
[1:23:48] <$legacy0117> The cost of monthly subscription to MMO is not a commitment I like when playing games.
[1:23:50] <megamonmon123> lol
[1:23:55] <%nepwar> LUL
[1:24:01] <%PulsinFufu> @nepwar just search on your phone QooApp, make an account then inside the app search teppen and thats it
[1:24:01] <armchairmaster_> Sims taught me how to game the system to get money, and using mods to put funny clothes, of lack thereof
[1:24:10] <arkv01> real firebat warrior
[1:24:12] <redrins> you heard it here first, starcraft 64 players are subhuman
[1:24:13] <DatAsuna> Fair
[1:24:14] <unclekulikov> I getch
[1:24:19] <%nawji> I wonder if woolie could get a controller hybrid workin for rts
[1:24:23] <megamonmon123> is this going up on youtube?
[1:24:27] <%nawji> that would be impressive
[1:24:31] <DatAsuna> Let's make woolie play endwar lol
[1:24:34] <DatAsuna> voice command rts
[1:24:37] <%PulsinFufu> @nepwar on your google chrome not the play store
[1:24:44] <the7thdraconian> Also, just want to say your hair looks great. The shorter dreads and the purple highlights look awesome.
[1:24:46] <@Solidus_113> You can't download or find the original Ridiculous Fishing anymore
[1:24:46] <notgarza> @legacy0117 that's what keeps me away from ff14 even though I really want to play it
[1:24:46] <+LastHazzerd> highly volatile market
[1:24:50] <joylent_blue> speaking of voice command games
[1:24:53] <joylent_blue> when's Lifeline PogChamp
[1:24:57] <%Ashenik1> Break or stream over?
[1:24:58] <redrins> depends on the game, gbf is still going strong
[1:24:58] <%LeaIsChill> Scott Pilgrim :(
[1:25:00] <%laserbeaming> My favorite card game is on life support. Will be dead any time soon.
[1:25:02] <joylent_blue> Ashenik1 break

[1:25:36] <%nepwar> @Solidus_113 ridiculoud fishing is gone?? shit i had that on my old phone
[1:25:46] <DSD24> I want to explain Pot of Greed
[1:25:54] <DatAsuna> what does pot of greed do?
[1:25:55] <+LastHazzerd> labbing in deck building is fun
[1:25:58] <redrins> it does have a banlist and restricted list tho
[1:26:00] <%og_reesetti> Pot of greed what's that do?
[1:26:02] <@Solidus_113> There's a point where the cost of upkeep of updates for newer systems is greater than the money you'd make keeping it on the store. It fucking sucks
[1:26:02] <nothuzad> but what does pot of greed do DSD24
[1:26:03] <BAM4LFE> does woolie know about the siivagunner auditions for a professor k?
[1:26:04] <KiraKamixephos> I’m excited for felyne
[1:26:05] <+BubbaRands> No one EXPLAINS Pot of Greed
[1:26:09] <@Menitta> WHAT DOES IT DO THO
[1:26:09] <megamonmon123> what does pot of greed do though?
[1:26:12] <+parzano> woolie has n pass premium produciton been affected by the rona?
[1:26:12] <%CursedNobleman> is woolie addicted to cardboard crack yet? PogChamp
[1:26:13] <%laserbeaming> Yeah, but teppen hasn't been running for more than a decade
[1:26:14] <+Ancopro> JAR of greed is where its AT

[1:26:14] <Fuzz_331> POG of greed thank you
[1:26:18] <+itsOnyxLeo> Pot of Greed? What's that do?
[1:26:21] <%PulsinFufu> @nepwar nope qooapp is fine dont worry
[1:26:22] <DSD24> It lets you draw 2 cards to your deck
[1:26:31] <+LastHazzerd> my favorite card game is Slay the Spire
[1:26:34] <+BubbaRands> Missed Timing in Yugioh tho...
[1:26:35] <%nepwar> aight thanks man
[1:26:36] <DatAsuna> That's key for non digital card games
[1:26:40] <%Superbro64> @solidus_113 the games I liked werent even server online type games
[1:26:47] <%og_reesetti> I just reached 1800 pts on ranked and I'm quite done fighting 5 denjin's in a row thank you

[1:26:55] <+parzano> Woolie can we expected altered results with our n pass or n pass premium usage during this trying time?

[1:27:07] <%kyh9> "5000 hours in Miku"
[1:27:09] <+LastHazzerd> we shall see?
[1:27:12] <%laserbeaming> This person didn't read their own question

[1:27:14] <%NYCrownlessKing> maybe in options @WoolieVersus
[1:27:14] <MayorRev> 8000 hours in tf2

[1:48:44] <redrins> x resonator decks now? what did I miss
[1:48:49] <+xwarllordxx> they really need to release more cards without adding an new mechanics
[1:48:57] <+IwuzPh34rless> Brains!
[1:48:57] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:48:59] <bentarcher> let him buff his stuff then steal it
[1:49:09] <%Ashenik1> @xdeathknightx is that even possble?
[1:49:32] <%CursedNobleman> What if Zero and X are reincarnations of Indra and Asura!? PogChamp
[1:49:39] <Bustahhwulf> bounce in hand Pog
[1:49:45] <Bennett_Fracture> who else plays duel colors...
[1:49:52] <%FuqBoiSlim> daimyo hermitaur is in this? PogChamp
[1:49:54] <bentarcher> purp green?
[1:49:55] <MayorRev> tuned out for a bit, did woolie match with kenny?
[1:50:03] <joylent_blue> nah kenny was busy
[1:50:06] <Bennett_Fracture> my akuma will leave you black and purple...
[1:50:07] <MayorRev> aw

[1:50:09] <Bustahhwulf> anything + black zombies
[1:50:12] <+xwarllordxx> cause that throw the everyone play style out of wack
[1:50:27] <+IwuzPh34rless> You have bounce tho
[1:50:30] <+ggbhtg> Hard Countered?
[1:50:37] <Bennett_Fracture> level 5 juri is my new waifu...
[1:50:39] <Bustahhwulf> lol woolie deck wins vs this
[1:50:57] <GarbageNirvana> Gonna have to rush him down with direct damage or hard removal if you can
[1:51:01] <bentarcher> throw x back into his hand and you could've hero art the other guy
[1:51:02] <$legacy0117> Ouch.
[1:51:03] <+IwuzPh34rless> I sense misplays in your future
[1:51:08] <MasterTonberry23> things are looking grim
[1:51:27] <+ggbhtg> Scurred by the D-fense
[1:52:03] <the7thdraconian> The art for this is really good.
[1:52:05] <+ggbhtg> it's ova
[1:52:14] <%BackwardCap> Yah ded, Jim.
[1:52:15] <bentarcher> F
[1:52:20] <Joysta> gg
[1:52:20] <%Ashenik1> F
[1:52:27] <Bennett_Fracture> perfect flawless victory...
[1:52:27] <GarbageNirvana> What are you fighting foooooor
[1:52:33] <%Ashenik1> coach time
[1:52:40] <Joysta> nah
[1:52:54] <+IwuzPh34rless> Honestly, you just misplayed. You could have won that
[1:52:59] <+xwarllordxx> I hope they add more cards and heroes without adding new mechanics
[1:52:59] <%BackwardCap> You counter Green Reso by bouncing their X after Charge Shot.
[1:53:01] <Joysta> started playing again after last teppen stream
[1:53:03] <Bennett_Fracture> just made it to b rank last night...
[1:53:19] <Bennett_Fracture> lvl 5 juri is the most valuable card right now...
[1:53:20] <+ggbhtg> You used the steal too early
[1:53:30] <+ggbhtg> on a nothing card
[1:53:49] <+devilxtrigger> I should really try getting into Teppen again
[1:53:53] <+El_Jefe_H0mbre> anyone have the room code?
[1:54:00] <bentarcher> better to wait until they invest cards into a unit before bouncing them
[1:54:09] <+ggbhtg> ^
[1:54:32] <+ggbhtg> X needs to stack up, you're trying to avoid small damage
[1:54:50] <+ggbhtg> X has mid game strats
[1:54:52] <+IwuzPh34rless> That split sucked
[1:54:54] <+xwarllordxx> they need to buff veil so badly
[1:55:16] <+gucci_sweatpants> buff.... veil?
[1:55:18] <haisho> oof Rakuhouha deck huh? Yeah it tends to suffer from dead draws
[1:55:25] <%og_reesetti> Why? Veil is pretty good at forcing your opponent to spend aoe/random cards
[1:55:29] <%Ashenik1> Imagine historical card game where lincoln is a perfect counter to Janissaries LUL
[1:55:35] <bentarcher> yeyeyeye
[1:56:12] <bentarcher> oof
[1:56:13] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1265145307408539648
[1:56:27] <+xwarllordxx> cause not alot of cards have and their so many ways just to stop it
[1:56:49] <bentarcher> shouldve waited
[1:56:54] <%og_reesetti> There's like, 2 ways to stop it tho?
[1:58:04] <+ggbhtg> You're feeling shit about this match but look at all the damage you're NOT taking
[1:58:31] <bentarcher> game
[1:58:33] <+ggbhtg> you could be dead already in another matchup
[1:58:34] <$legacy0117> You can do eeeet
[1:58:37] <haisho> oh you finally stabilized
[1:58:39] <Fuzz_331> man johnny young bosh is the shit
[1:58:41] <KiraKamixephos> You pretty much won
[1:58:45] <+gucci_sweatpants> dude what
[1:59:00] <bentarcher> X hunters, play card win game
[1:59:04] <Joysta> ggs
[1:59:14] <%Joe2187> No doom today?
[1:59:18] <MasterTonberry23> Not such a hard counter after all
[1:59:24] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus You had nothing to play, but you got to MILL
[1:59:26] <%og_reesetti> and nobody was surprised
[1:59:27] <+teefbig> teefbig subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:59:33] <haisho> can be hard to stabilize with X having really sticky cards
[1:59:40] <Joysta> this was fun
[1:59:41] <treacherously_> Just get to late game and win
[1:59:41] <$legacy0117> Punched a Megaman.
[1:59:48] <+ggbhtg> BURN through your cards until you WIN
[2:00:13] <%Joe2187> Getting into Mobile games?
[2:00:42] <+ggbhtg> @joe2187 Getting into doodCap
[2:00:49] <%BackwardCap> Taking 1 makes a huge difference if they invested most of their resources into making a single huge target.
[2:00:51] <+ggbhtg> nothing more or less
[2:00:56] <MasterTonberry23> what am i fighting fooor
[2:01:01] <haisho> Mind Control is pretty weird
[2:01:12] <haisho> kinda need meta knowledge to know what you have to steal
[2:01:18] <%Joe2187> I tried to get into teppen, but I didnt like the battle system
[2:01:54] <haisho> oof dead draw
[2:01:56] <+KevinsLunchbox> i dont understand anything of what im seeing but i can imagine laying in bed playing this
[2:01:59] <%Joe2187> Still play Skullgirls Mobile daily tho...but it plays like an actual fighter however
[2:01:59] <%og_reesetti> 4 negate cards oh boy
[2:02:05] <megamonmon123> draw, waifu cardo
[2:02:32] <+KevinsLunchbox> how good is woolie at this? on podcast recently i think he said top 500?
[2:02:33] <%teefbig> When's Third Strike?
[2:02:56] <%Joe2187> Is the background stage from RE4 with the double gigante fight?
[2:03:04] <%og_reesetti> Top 1000 but he's got 1800+ points so he's in the range of top 500
[2:03:12] <+KevinsLunchbox> ah
[2:03:28] <PKSomething> I have no idea whats happening but the art is nice
[2:03:28] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:03:40] <bentarcher> only on 3 or less
[2:03:50] <%og_reesetti> ^
[2:04:02] <Bennett_Fracture> attend... quoi...
[2:04:06] <Bennett_Fracture> i mean...
[2:04:08] <megamonmon123> am I hearing orchestral devil trigger?
[2:04:09] <Bennett_Fracture> wait...what...
[2:04:17] <bentarcher> always the eager one
[2:04:18] <%antyriku2> that you are
[2:04:39] <%og_reesetti> Yeah each of the characters has orchestral versions of songs from their respective games
[2:04:48] <%og_reesetti> Personal favorite for me is Evil Ryu
[2:04:51] <megamonmon123> oh cool gotcha
[2:04:53] <%Joe2187> what does AP do?
[2:05:06] <KiraKamixephos> You spend it on super
[2:05:11] <%og_reesetti> Like that
[2:05:30] <haisho> 4MP X Hunters disgusting
[2:05:32] <bentarcher> game
[2:05:43] <%Joe2187> what the fuck
[2:05:52] <%gutlesscoward> hunt that x
[2:05:53] <KiraKamixephos> X hunters kinda busted
[2:05:55] <+TechnoSyndrome> that's still the play huh
[2:05:55] <megamonmon123> is woolie unstoppable?
[2:06:04] <+IwuzPh34rless> LUL no
[2:06:13] <haisho> X hunters can be played around but it's hecka strong
[2:06:13] <megamonmon123> yami woolie truly the king of games
[2:06:18] <DatAsuna> humblebrag
[2:06:18] <%nepwar> yes unstoppable woolz
[2:06:26] <KiraKamixephos> He’s playing a big meta deck
[2:06:29] <gryffinp> Woolie is LITERALLY UNDEFEATABLE, he will NEVER fall
[2:06:32] <DatAsuna> I can't believe woolie said he was unstoppable
[2:06:37] <haisho> long story short if you're playing against Zero you have to EXPECT X Hunters
[2:06:39] <+Ancopro> just big ol normal brag!
[2:06:53] <%gutlesscoward> literally unstoppable, unable to lose, got it
[2:06:54] <%teefbig> woolieSMUG woolieSMUG woolieSMUG
[2:06:55] <%nepwar> woolie only loses so as to not draw attention to his prowess
[2:06:55] <megamonmon123> woolie says hes the best teppen player live on stream LUL
[2:06:57] <bentarcher> how many games have you won without playing x hunters?
[2:07:01] <+neutralraff> Dam all this bosting jeez.
[2:07:06] <%og_reesetti> When I play against Rakouha I expect to not have fun
[2:07:15] <+IwuzPh34rless> Woolie has been making some misplays as well
[2:07:26] <Bustahhwulf> woolie plays almost no units besides v or xhunters he has to win with it
[2:07:29] <+IwuzPh34rless> Goes to show just how strong the deck is
[2:07:30] <%TrafficCohen> So what I'm getting is, Hunter X Hunter is real important to you Woolie?
[2:07:38] <megamonmon123> or are the misplays actually high iq plays @iwuzph34rless
[2:07:44] <+IwuzPh34rless> LUL no
[2:07:54] <PKSomething> Wish I was able to read what these cards do. Like hearthstone has extensions for that on twitch streams
[2:09:05] <+IwuzPh34rless> Yeah if only Teppen was more mainstream
[2:09:08] <%og_reesetti> Yeah watching games go is unfriendly to new people
[2:09:35] <Doopness> projCARDS
[2:09:48] <+IwuzPh34rless> That's GG
[2:09:53] <bentarcher> oof
[2:09:55] <reddpop_> woolie stop he's already dead
[2:09:56] <usurper_sos> Thats a win
[2:09:59] <megamonmon123> This is kinda like watching the yugioh anime but the main character is super chill
[2:10:06] <haisho> People shitting themselves over Nightmare when Shadow is the real threat
[2:10:13] <%reonome> gg
[2:10:20] <%teefbig> light work
[2:10:22] <megamonmon123> yami woolie cannot lose
[2:10:22] <%nepwar> casually sending all your viewers to the shadow realm
[2:10:35] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Woo, that was rough
[2:10:35] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:10:36] <%gutlesscoward> all these neros dropping like dead weight
[2:10:37] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Ggs
[2:10:47] <%exaltedma> Anyone else looking forward to the Felyne hero in July?
[2:10:52] <emptyantics> They really need to nerf Zero
[2:10:55] <bentarcher> I am
[2:11:00] <+IwuzPh34rless> or stealth
[2:11:07] <emptyantics> Felyne is gonna be incredible
[2:11:16] <%og_reesetti> Yeah we're seeing purple nerfs like crazy come the next season
[2:11:18] <%teefbig> is Makoto in this game?
[2:11:23] <+IwuzPh34rless> Honestly they need to nerf the memory mechanic
[2:11:24] <bentarcher> I really hope this next set strengthens earlier mechanics instead of introducing a new one
[2:11:47] <%Amardeux> wew time for all the blow...away LUL
[2:11:47] <bentarcher> Bosch hcsoB
[2:11:52] <haisho> it's really just Rakuhouha ramping really fast for its AP cost that's the problem
[2:11:54] <%og_reesetti> Please enjoy two dudes playing solitare
[2:11:59] <megamonmon123> so whats the monster reborn of this game
[2:12:04] <+IwuzPh34rless> With the past trends it's always been a new mechanic tho
[2:12:08] <%teefbig> But can you double fukiage people with Makoto? I'll get it for that.
[2:12:15] <Doopness> @WoolieVersus Hey what does this card game do differently than other online card games?
[2:12:24] <haisho> no fukiages sadly
[2:12:27] <+IwuzPh34rless> @megamonmon123 Uroborous Wesker
[2:12:31] <%Amardeux> most of your card playing happens in real time @Doopness
[2:12:42] <%Amardeux> instead of it being turnbased
[2:12:43] <bentarcher> cenetr nightmare rough
[2:12:48] <bentarcher> oof
[2:12:49] <sleepy_pink> TWO
[2:12:52] <+TechnoSyndrome> gross
[2:12:52] <megamonmon123> Fuck
[2:12:54] <%nepwar> JESUS
[2:12:56] <%Amardeux> jesus
[2:12:57] <Joysta> wow.
[2:12:59] <usurper_sos> Hmmm
[2:13:00] <megamonmon123> Thats basically 2 exodia right?
[2:13:01] <PKSomething> How do you deal with that?
[2:13:01] <%Amardeux> woolie you madlad
[2:13:03] <%reonome> monkaS
[2:13:06] <haisho> you're playing against hybrid purple/black though
[2:13:15] <haisho> they kinda WANT their cards to die
[2:13:26] <bentarcher> mistakes
[2:13:41] <%Amardeux> stop blowing us away NotLikeThis
[2:13:46] <+IwuzPh34rless> He'll have chump blockers I'm sure
[2:13:55] <%gutlesscoward> zero will never stop blowing you away
[2:14:08] <bentarcher> one nightmare will get through
[2:14:11] <+IwuzPh34rless> The bottom one should still hit
[2:14:12] <@Menitta> unless...?
[2:14:15] <haisho> one worked
[2:14:19] <+TechnoSyndrome> spillover
[2:14:20] <megamonmon123> huh
[2:14:22] <bentarcher> bottom row advances slower
[2:14:24] <dekiriyadi> spillover
[2:14:25] <haisho> spillover too
[2:14:26] <+IwuzPh34rless> The middle attacked half a second sooner
[2:14:33] <PKSomething> whats spillover?
[2:14:42] <bentarcher> when things come out at the same time Top hits first then middle then bottom
[2:14:51] <megamonmon123> it sounds like when sex goes wrong
[2:14:54] <PKSomething> Oh like splash damage
[2:14:57] <+UnderseaMagic> trample for other creatures
[2:14:58] <+BringBackSempai> so Trample
[2:15:02] <haisho> golden rule against black: You see Sigma, you STEAL Sigma
[2:15:05] <+TechnoSyndrome> so since one nightmare did enough to kill both the other hit directly
[2:15:10] <+IwuzPh34rless> Spillover is half the attackers damage rounded down
[2:15:34] <+IwuzPh34rless> So a center nightmare willk do 13dmg to what's in front and 6 to the sides
[2:15:41] <haisho> yeah
[2:16:11] <megamonmon123> that makes sense
[2:16:14] <%Amardeux> LUL
[2:16:16] <%reonome> LUL
[2:16:17] <usurper_sos> LUL
[2:16:19] <+IwuzPh34rless> That last one wasn't life
[2:16:30] <+IwuzPh34rless> It was deal 5dmg to opponents board
[2:16:31] <haisho> last one was destroy deal 5
[2:16:45] <+IwuzPh34rless> Silly Woolz
[2:16:56] <%PulsinFufu> clumsyTehe i would play but my deck is made to counter most meta decks
[2:17:23] <+IwuzPh34rless> Bring a Denjin Ryu teched against Zero
[2:17:38] <bentarcher> GG
[2:17:38] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:18:17] <haisho> so many damn purple mirrors on ranked
[2:18:20] <megamonmon123> unbeatable woolie
[2:18:28] <MayorRev> what if kirby had a teppen game
[2:18:28] <@Menitta> look how unstoppable he is
[2:18:37] <gryffinp> could he be the Chosen One?
[2:18:38] <megamonmon123> completely unstoppable
[2:18:43] <@Menitta> ah man
[2:18:47] <@Menitta> I wanted a shot lol
[2:18:48] <%nepwar> untouchable branded unfuckable
[2:18:57] <+TechnoSyndrome> damn i couldn't even reinstall in time
[2:18:59] <%og_reesetti> Missed my chance man fuck
[2:18:59] <bentarcher> I hope someday I can get in and show you some stuff
[2:19:05] <%PulsinFufu> clumsyREE woolie is too good for this game
[2:19:06] <KiraKamixephos> ggs
[2:19:18] <+IwuzPh34rless> The memes with Heart tank
[2:19:22] <KiraKamixephos> As soon as my sigma was stolen it was pretty much over for me
[2:19:26] <+IwuzPh34rless> c'mon godkar
[2:19:33] <Joysta> oh nice is he also resing?

[2:24:11] <%Zayasu> woolieFUN
[2:24:16] <gryffinp> did woolie just imply stream sniping
[2:24:19] <+IwuzPh34rless> So lag literally affects how fast you can respond
[2:24:29] <megamonmon123> best of 3?
[2:24:31] <%reonome> LUL
[2:24:32] <%og_reesetti> I mean, you're also playing Zero, it's easy to expect V when your opponent isn't playing anything
[2:24:34] <joylent_blue> because HONOR

[2:24:57] <joylent_blue> GODKAR
[2:24:57] <+IwuzPh34rless> YES!
[2:24:58] <haisho> and Woolie is instantly dead
[2:25:04] <%LordSDB> Woolie just saying, just play to win
[2:25:09] <DatAsuna> I can't believe woolie said cheating is the only moral option
[2:25:25] <megamonmon123> woolie supports cheating?
[2:25:31] <megamonmon123> no dignity
[2:25:35] <joylent_blue> godkar BibleThump
[2:25:40] <+IwuzPh34rless> I knew he was running it but Woolz got lucky with the nightmare rooCry
[2:26:02] <%nepwar> well if the player is showing you their cards, it's your duty to use it to your advantage
[2:26:05] <%LordSDB> Woolie just giving out a free handicap, so if you do stream snipe, you lose twice woolieSMUG
[2:26:06] <+IwuzPh34rless> It's 5mp Woolz
[2:26:22] <%og_reesetti> tfw you don't remember card costs
[2:26:25] <megamonmon123> Come on woolie, you can win
[2:26:26] <+TechnoSyndrome> i'm impressed woolie can play this and read chat at the same time

[2:28:22] <%og_reesetti> Woolie chased the meta
[2:28:27] <joylent_blue> the new main rhymes with Nero so its cool
[2:28:28] <%og_reesetti> In search of more power
[2:28:36] <+CelioHogane> Why does Zero have Nero's voice?
[2:28:41] <megamonmon123> And to think.woolie bragged about being unbeatable before
[2:28:42] <+PR0swagonist> He traded one johnny yong bosch for another
[2:28:46] <Dr_Suddenboner> is this the game or a menu? limmySteel
[2:28:46] <joylent_blue> cuz he has Nero's voice

[2:34:35] <%nawji> if it's still unsolicited opinion hour when you mentioned that play in Avatar that served as a recap it reminded me of a segment in Thunderbolt Fantasy's first movie that recaps the first season. If you want a peek into the madness of a Taiwanese puppet theater wuxia show directed be Gen Urobutchi himself check out some scenes on youtube. Finding this new format of show was like discovering anime as a kid all over again.

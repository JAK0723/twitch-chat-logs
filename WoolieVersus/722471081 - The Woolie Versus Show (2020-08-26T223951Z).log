[2:21:00] <Pudgy_Pidgey> Yeah, it twas the claymation movement that made it unsettling
[2:21:04] <FutaSnek> Clamation framerate IS SUPER UNSETTLEING thank you

[2:22:15] <FishTacosTonite> Robocop must be Hard-R not PG-13
[2:22:17] <+Reverend_Roscoe> The only good scene from new 'cop was THAT ONE
[2:22:17] <%Josef_Stryker> Man that mutation scene was horrifying
[2:23:13] <FutaSnek> @WoolieVersus The scene in Robocop 2 where the prototype Robocop rips his helmet off fucked me up as a kid cause you can see all the circuitry pull out of his eye sockets as he takes it off
[2:23:20] <%DensityD> great answer
[2:23:23] <%huskarl_zap> Revenant from doom cameo PogChamp
[2:23:25] <sozemd> has mk11 devolved into projectile spam
[2:23:30] <%Josef_Stryker> One thing I super appreciate about OG RoboCop was that they didn't make his partner a romantic interest. Afaik they simply remained friends. Tho I haven't seen the sequels
[2:23:33] <FishTacosTonite> I mean the new Robocop was better Robocop 3but that's not saying much. Lmao
[2:23:33] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @FutaSnek the failed robocop 2s were great
[2:23:34] <%DensityD> take sonic fox down with angles
[2:23:40] <%DensityD> creep by Radiohead
[2:23:52] <FutaSnek> @Reverend_Roscoe They where body horror gold
[2:23:56] <%BisoromiBear> yeah, Robocop 2 was nightmare fuel
[2:24:15] <FishTacosTonite> I love Robocop 2
[2:24:15] <yesar94> jax?
[2:24:19] <+CryptusMaximus> Robocop is the most zonery zoner in the game, so yeah he's pure projectile spam
[2:24:24] <%Josef_Stryker> Do u think we can still get Ash for Mortal Kombat?
[2:24:34] <FutaSnek> WE GOTTA NINJA MIME IN THE HOUSE
[2:24:35] <+Reverend_Roscoe> @FutaSnek R2 is one of like 3 movies that got me into body horror as a kid

[2:30:02] <%Josef_Stryker> I'm guessing u can die to chip in MK11?
[2:30:05] <andre11dr> You can tell because one bar disappears before getting chiped
[2:30:42] <cgame_me811> Yes
[2:30:46] <FutaSnek> Reggie with the info
[2:30:55] <FishTacosTonite> Yes chip is real in MK11 but you have last breath so to speak where you get free extra hitd.

[4:18:09] <Dova573> god I miss watching tournaments Damn you covid
[4:18:11] <arkv01> coulda just went nuclear
[4:18:11] <+JustToWatch> I realized sonic was a born show-person at evo when they held up goichi's hand after evo grandfinals
[4:18:17] <arkv01> but nah lets leave a few buildings
[4:18:26] <+jiggy_snipe> @trustycoyote you can dislike cockiness but you have to respect his game
[4:18:33] <+Blackenedcrustcynicism> Is it over?
[4:18:42] <%doomerskeletor13> I believe it honestly, if he had mained Joker the whole time
[4:18:43] <Muffinmastr> joker tooo goood
[4:18:45] <%doomerskeletor13> Yeah it’s over
[4:18:48] <%trustycoyote> @jiggy_snipe Fair. I agree
[4:18:52] <Muffinmastr> id love to see sonic joker cumbos
[4:19:00] <+Blackenedcrustcynicism> Sonic didn't play Joker? Did they play RoboCop?
[4:19:20] <yesar94> spawn
[4:19:20] <%doomerskeletor13> They played Joker a few times, but they changed it up a lot
[4:19:25] <+linSP> did terminator show up
[4:19:27] <WakeUpThrow> SF played Joker for the first, 7th and last match iirc
[4:19:29] <+JustToWatch> sonic played like a dozen characters
[4:19:33] <andre11dr> @jiggy_snipe Also i think it's part of his strategy
[4:19:35] <%doomerskeletor13> No terminator
[4:19:38] <+linSP> aw
[4:19:44] <+jiggy_snipe> @Blackenedcrustcynicism he was playing alot of people including Joker and Robocop, it was dope

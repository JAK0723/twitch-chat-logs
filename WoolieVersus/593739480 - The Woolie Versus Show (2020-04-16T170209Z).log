[0:05:56] <playdohface> He alrdy isolated i thought
[0:05:59] <%gatorafan> Too stuck with the mainstream (in this case, Mario Party)
[0:06:04] <jevichrono> I hope the peace pool is renamed as the Salt pool

[0:08:23] <%Hawkbone_> @HDmexiqtioner The Blood Pool is a prize pool of money for the person who wins at the end of Dokapon. The Peace Pool AKA The Bitch Pool is money that goes to the loser, I believe. You can donate to either simply by noting that its supposed to go to a pool in the donation message.
[0:08:24] <wendisky> I came for Patapon
[0:08:24] <Shishi1205> 40?
[0:08:24] <%optimasmaximas> @CaptainPileDriver nice man! which pool you sending it too?

[0:36:47] <megamirk> "it doesn't affect their Korean age" LUL
[0:36:50] <Shishi1205> So you are sometimes 2 years older than you are
[0:36:51] <%jiggy_snipe> that is a fun fact
[0:36:51] <BlacSoul> KAGE
[0:36:53] <sonofthedeepsouth> That sounds super anti-individualist
[0:36:53] <+Mkingston> You told us to make an RPG. We made Quest 64 but we made an RPG..
[0:36:57] <nepwar> That means all koreans are legal at the same time

[0:37:30] <%ekodrop> no woolie, he said that your age starts at 1 not 0
[0:37:31] <nyacoo> So is it just a traditional thing that's in the back of everyone's mind, but is it actually the default used in everyday life?
[0:37:32] <+cha0tic_klutch> Age is just a number :) It‚Äôs the back pain that counts
[0:37:32] <OldManDeckardCain> fun fact, a similar system functioned at Epstein's island Kappa

[0:37:42] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:37:42] <Camail> saying "additional" implies the regular is more important to them
[0:37:42] <SomeponysScribbles> So what happens if you were born on December 31st? Does that mean you get an instant level 2?
[0:37:45] <BlacSoul> !Wrong
[0:37:46] <megamirk> Plastic surgery affinity and +1 to Korean Age on startup

[0:41:14] <Camail> I typically use punctation, but sometimes you just dont, ynkow?
[0:41:16] <nyacoo> Properly punctuate to establish dominance.
[0:41:18] <+tearknack> also my brian no work good

[0:42:12] <Riottrio> i do like Pat's twitter tactic of never correcting any typo.
[0:42:15] <%Hawkbone_> Written language is a meme
[0:42:19] <+Mkingston> Once Boomers start using it I stop.
[0:42:22] <%TitaniumDragoonNeo> Hand clap is still a thing in certain... activist circles.

[0:42:29] <Shishi1205> Written pat sounds as accurate as normal Pat
[0:42:33] <ReelDeath> not as expressive
[0:42:34] <%Th3SmartAlec> Your meme... dies with youj.
[0:42:34] <%Superbro64> `Maybe humans are actually pretty terrible at comprehending the written language
[0:42:37] <+Amaideus> My super power is that I have that in vocal conversations
[0:42:39] <+Aztec50> Is that what /s means?!?
[0:42:40] <+tearknack> language is a meme, in the literal sense

[0:42:45] <NeroInfinite> "Fuck the typos I type how I want." -pat probably
[0:42:47] <pennykettle_> Aztec50 no /s

[1:04:06] <%gatorafan> Discord breakdown daedra1LaughingTibs
[1:04:09] <%jiggy_snipe> Woolie's opinion is that he just wants the select button back and share button still exist
[1:04:09] <NickHatesSnow> I hate the share button to
[1:04:13] <+tearknack> which discord is the breakdown in?
[1:04:14] <+Joelexion> F
[1:04:20] <%Hawkbone_> IT STILL HAS A FUCKING SELECT BUTTON
[1:04:20] <%arkv01> the share button is universally garbage
[1:04:21] <Twinmin> Wait did they not start yet or just finish?
[1:04:22] <C4m3r0n0409> TOUCHPAD IS SELECT
[1:04:25] <+gustavozxd> the touchpad is 2 different select buttons
[1:04:26] <%SuperKirby24> F
[1:04:26] <%jepupu> I like being able to take screenshots on PS4. I dunno how to do it better.
[1:04:27] <Picia000123> its fine
[1:04:28] <+Amaideus> Haven't started
[1:04:29] <%jiggy_snipe> Pat did not want the share button at all
[1:04:34] <%Hawkbone_> IT HAS 4 SELECT BUTTONS
[1:04:39] <+MrAtheGreat> Touchpad doesn‚Äôt count as select to me.
[1:04:39] <citerel> i wish the share button was like the switch screenshot button
[1:04:42] <+linSP> it was in the wrong place, switch did it better
[1:04:45] <Camail> yo chill
[1:04:46] <+gustavozxd> NotLikeThis touchpaaaaad
[1:04:49] <NickHatesSnow> @jiggy_snipe No he said he didn't want it where it was
[1:04:50] <lagandcrash> BRING BACK THE SELECT BUTTON
[1:04:58] <+soFISHticated98> touchpad is de facto select but it's not a dedicated select button
[1:05:00] <+gustavozxd> IN EVERY CASE
[1:05:00] <johnnydalmann> FBCatch L
[1:05:05] <%Rekinsinn> the vita button combo of home + start was great for screenshots
[1:05:07] <%Hawkbone_> There's already 4 more select buttons, Woolie.
[1:05:09] <%Beastman1235_> but gotta share the gameplay FAST
[1:05:09] <%emperordread> Bring back N64 Z trigger
[1:05:10] <%jepupu> But social media is with the days! Gotta have that FaceBook‚Ñ¢ button
[1:05:14] <C4m3r0n0409> TOUCHPAD WOOLIE
[1:05:16] <%xcompleasedad> I feel like that that post was bait
[1:05:17] <+gustavozxd> touchpad is more than one button @woolieversus
[1:05:17] <%Beastman1235_> two presses is TOO long
[1:05:19] <+soFISHticated98> like technically the touchpad isn't a select button
[1:05:22] <%xx123manxx> Tochpad sucks ass
[1:05:22] <NickHatesSnow> Fuk the touchpad
[1:05:23] <%arkv01> why not swim in blood woolieYE
[1:05:25] <therealtacopancakes> plus the fucking touch button is farther from my thumb than the share one
[1:05:27] <%Superbro64> chatterbox sajamSegue3 sajamSegue4
[1:05:28] <%jiggy_snipe> @NickHatesSnow after Woolie made his stance, Pat does not care for the share button at all
[1:05:32] <+soFISHticated98> it ends up being one but in reality it could just not be a select button depending on the game
[1:05:33] <+Joelexion> I 100% agree with woolie.
[1:05:37] <Camail> touchpad is kinda meh
[1:05:38] <C4m3r0n0409> Cry more
[1:05:39] <+gustavozxd> touchpad is more than 1 button, devs don't use it cause they don't want to
[1:05:45] <+MrAtheGreat> I hate the touchpad select because if it‚Äôs dedicated to the map it causes the map to violently lurch whenever you bring it up a la yakuza
[1:05:45] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:05:46] <BlacSoul> Double Tap already has a function
[1:05:47] <Camail> reverse goblins are in full effect
[1:05:48] <%Superbro64> Looks like CHATTERBOX has the goblins huh?
[1:05:50] <lagandcrash> Touch button should be for in game stuff
[1:05:51] <%Superbro64> sajamSegue3 sajamSegue4
[1:05:53] <%Hawkbone_> The touchpad is FOUR select buttons, Woolie.
[1:05:54] <boogaleeboo> I can't believe woolie literally cuts the share button out of his PS4 controllers
[1:05:54] <nepwar> speaking of controller goblins. I hate death stranding map function where you have to touch and tilt to check the topagraphy
[1:05:57] <pennykettle_> The subreddit wants a new controversial gamer topic to yell about each week even if they have to force it
[1:06:00] <+soFISHticated98> Hawkbone we get it
[1:06:01] <%xx123manxx> My thing is "I like the SHARE button"
[1:06:01] <+FrenchTact1cs> Select is just touch now, not a big deal
[1:06:01] <Mr_Ease> I mean it was also pat exaggerating it and that being rolled into your discussion
[1:06:02] <+linSP> Touchpad was interesting, but I hope they don‚Äôt bring it back
[1:06:02] <+gustavozxd> @mrathegreat ???????
[1:06:02] <OldManDeckardCain> more buttons = easier to play? Stell battlaion wants to know your number LUL
[1:06:05] <+soFISHticated98> stop screaming about the touchpad
[1:06:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> my couch is just filled with deep farts today
[1:06:08] <+Dundee15> 100% agree on the share/shame button.
[1:06:10] <+tearknack> hweres this big crazy breakdown?
[1:06:14] <NickHatesSnow> @jiggy_snipe Yeah but Pat specifically said he likes the idea of a share feature in general just not where it was and even specified the switch as an example
[1:06:22] <Picia000123> @linSP They are literally bringing it back
[1:06:23] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> I love you Woolie
[1:06:24] <%ekodrop> 3
[1:06:24] <+MrAtheGreat> @gustavozxd I too have mind goblins
[1:06:25] <%arkv01> folding @ home STILL exists?
[1:06:34] <pennykettle_> I used to do folding at home with my ps3, felt good even if it doesnt do shit
[1:06:35] <royb2> YEa
[1:06:35] <%ekodrop> it does
[1:06:36] <%Irridium> That was PS3 yeah
[1:06:37] <%optimasmaximas> never heard of this
[1:06:42] <%optimasmaximas> but cool i guess
[1:06:46] <+gustavozxd> obviously the touch function of the touchpad sucks but touchpad is more than 1 button so Woolie is factually wrong
[1:06:47] <%TheOneUpWarrior> The Katamari prince creepin on Minh
[1:06:47] <+ChrisPlaysThing> After working in QA for 6 years, if every buttons does what it says it should and works idgaf
[1:06:48] <%arkv01> I remember using it like 10 years ago
[1:06:51] <%ekodrop> folding @ home killed my ps3
[1:06:54] <%jepupu> SETI@Home was like the original
[1:06:57] <%emperordread> It's the same as bitcoin mining, but for science and not bitcoins
[1:06:58] <%Prevot> so its cryptomining?
[1:07:02] <+MrAtheGreat> I used it once and never again.

[1:07:19] <%jepupu> t.35yo boomer
[1:07:23] <pennykettle_> Ive heard of other games like that
[1:07:26] <+gustavozxd> the reason people are going crazy is because Woolie's opinion is based on a lie LUL
[1:07:27] <pennykettle_> or a website
[1:07:44] <%Th3SmartAlec> @andrei11dr we're still at the start
[1:07:44] <%andrei11dr> At least it seems like i didn't miss the salt
[1:07:47] <pennykettle_> Folding at Home is basically bitcoin mining but all your machines are part of a bigger project
[1:07:50] <%Hawkbone_> Woolie is literally just objectively wrong on the share button thing
[1:07:50] <+soFISHticated98> nobody wants to use the touchpad thoug
[1:08:06] <%Hawkbone_> @soFISHticated98 Its literally just a button.
[1:08:08] <FrostedZaibatsu> Pay 60$ to do work because its "cool" >_>
[1:08:08] <+Risingxiv> double tapping the ps button and holding the ps button already have a function . . .
[1:08:10] <lagandcrash> touchpad is greasy with cheeto dust
[1:08:13] <blue2red> HahaLean
[1:08:14] <%xx123manxx> It's so cold in the D(okapon) how we ever gunna keep the peace?
[1:08:18] <+Ryu_R> touchpad can stay if the buttons stay
[1:08:19] <pennykettle_> stop using the word objectively like that @Hawkbone_
[1:08:19] <%JetpackMcQuack> Woolie is literally objectively right about the share button
[1:08:21] <+gustavozxd> I like pressing select with my right thumb
[1:08:21] <%TheOneUpWarrior> Sub Daddy rolling through at work
[1:08:22] <+soFISHticated98> it's a button that's 10 times larger than it needs to be
[1:08:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> BLOOD POOOOOOOL

[1:12:21] <+soFISHticated98> also bits are some bs gacha currency for streams
[1:12:23] <%andrei11dr> More than regular donations
[1:12:25] <+soFISHticated98> stop buying into bits guys
[1:12:28] <%xcompleasedad> You get the bits full out, because we "buy" them from them
[1:12:30] <Teras_ode> Probs striking while the iron's ice cold & people are gonna ResidentSleeper over this, but did anyone already tell woolie about Indivisible Coop & New Game+ update?
[1:12:34] <pennykettle_> You pay the cost upfront, they dont take a cut when they are given. The bits you get are the bits you get @WoolieVersus
[1:12:44] <pennykettle_> Teras_ode yea they saw

[1:26:37] <%arkv01> you are LITERALLY doubting him LUL
[1:26:41] <+soFISHticated98> it really doesn't do anything
[1:26:48] <+netrac> but a physical therapist is a real thing
[1:26:49] <%jiggy_snipe> Chiropractors appear as expert witnesses in lawsuits which is interesting
[1:26:52] <+soFISHticated98> straight physical therapy is a lot better and carries less risk

[1:29:56] <+linSP> also don‚Äôt tell someone who‚Äôs dying that you‚Äôll pray for them
[1:29:58] <MaverickJoker> a physician is the textbook analysts, and the chiropractor is the practice equivalence of it
[1:30:00] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @soFISHticated98
[1:30:05] <IndiaSwift> If your mind does it/placebo does it, then doesn't it still technically work for some people? I mean, a success is a success, right?

[1:30:34] <+soFISHticated98> but why pay for a placebo which can be bad for you
[1:30:35] <Xeno351> acupuncture isn't TOTAL bull but most of the people who advertise it are shysters
[1:30:39] <+soFISHticated98> if you can just get the real thing
[1:30:39] <+Amaideus> So just make your own associations and you'll be good
[1:30:40] <nepwar> that was a nice podcast bit
[1:30:40] <%gatorafan> @causewaybob still waiting for Woolie's turn Kappa
[1:30:45] <Teras_ode> I think they say hypnotism depends alot on the person allowing themselves to be hypnotized, subconciously or not

[1:36:32] <Vortigon> awesome LuvBlondeL
[1:36:40] <+soFISHticated98> like my first guess was raiding a stream means a bunch of people "invade" the chat and try to take over the conversation, troll, etc.
[1:36:41] <MattDemers> How we doin' today, manga readers?
[1:36:41] <%andrei11dr> Will hit evo money by the end of this
[1:36:41] <%xx123manxx> @WoolieVersus just hit the triggers on the map to auto spot
[1:36:46] <+soFISHticated98> so the name "raid" is just unfortunate
[1:36:46] <Iminari> Hello, how are all of you?
[1:36:48] <+PunJ0hn> someone donate their stimulus check to the bloodpool
[1:36:49] <+HDmexiqtioner> How long does this last usually? The game.
[1:36:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> I had to step away, what's the Bloodpool at?
[1:36:59] <sonofthedeepsouth> DONATE NEET BUX
[1:36:59] <SethKyu> heads up, you can snap to other players on the map using L and R buttons, thought you should know with how big the map is
[1:37:05] <%Hawkbone_> @soFISHticated98 Raiding has been a thing on Twitch since it was called JustinTV
[1:37:07] <%EyeFarted> forest?
[1:37:08] <Varadox> Bloodpool is at 1445.
[1:37:10] <Dhurkst> @soFISHticated98 Not really. Most people think of MMO raids nowadays, as in "we're going to go into this thing as a group and have fun"
[1:37:10] <crimsonsaens> Whenever the boys run low on money they can just do Dokapon streams
[1:37:19] <rosemon5001> hes plan is soo hidden even he himself doesnt know it
[1:37:32] <%MisterArcanine> I wonder how many sessions we have left because oh god the bloodpool could get huge
[1:37:44] <%gatorafan> Minh playing 4D chess even with himself! woolieMINHSTINCT
[1:37:52] <sonofthedeepsouth> This game can get to the hundred hours
[1:37:53] <3rdRunner> We're 3/8ths through the game @misterarcanine
[1:37:54] <+soFISHticated98> well the reality is the raid was annoying because it was a bunch of people spamming emotes
[1:38:02] <sonofthedeepsouth> This pool bout to be an ocean
[1:38:06] <%MisterArcanine> Oh god lmao

[1:38:20] <%MisterArcanine> Reggie gang paws up
[1:38:22] <MattDemers> @3rdRunner Did they really expect someone to play this ALL THE WAY THROUGH with human PCs? Like, damn. I understand why Mario Party has one board at a time.

[1:38:23] <%emperordread> "It's when you do what ya don't gotta do" - Woolie
[1:38:26] <moonologist> I didnt realize you could put the monsters to sleep

[1:38:27] <big_oki> 1445 will do that do a man
[1:38:33] <%andrei11dr> That was lucky
[1:38:34] <+Can_Do_Kamel> Har har take that woolie
[1:38:35] <+Joelexion> Hypnosis accuracy
[1:38:47] <%Hawkbone_> @soFISHticated98 For like, 5 seconds. Its just to let the streamer know a raid is happening so they can thank the streamer that sent them. I feel like you are really trying to make this a bad thing when its not.

[3:42:55] <gryffinp> I'
[3:42:56] <+soFISHticated98> who cares if it's auto
[3:42:56] <%viewtifulr> so lets lie
[3:42:59] <preppyposs> REGGIES IN LAST
[3:43:01] <preppyposs> OH NO
[3:43:02] <%Livelinne> woolieWUT oh no it‚Äôs becoming also the Jinro game
[3:43:04] <%Hawkbone_> @soFISHticated98 but barely any have when they go for a strike
[3:43:04] <%xx123manxx> bottom right
[3:43:04] <preppyposs> HE HAS A CONTRACT
[3:43:05] <gryffinp> I thought the others CAN see the chat, it's just that woolie reads the most
[3:43:08] <+nintega010> Now woolie is second
[3:43:11] <BurlyBeef> Minh is the late stage ottoman empire
[3:43:13] <+soFISHticated98> so, it'd be bad if it was every time
[3:43:14] <Sedrelic> grape juice
[3:43:16] <+soFISHticated98> it's been a good rate
[3:43:20] <%xx123manxx> !! BOTTOM RIGHT !!
[3:43:20] <+craftyraichu> I wonder when assassin bot will return for the doublecross
[3:43:20] <Teras_ode> weren't we supposed to save the princess woolie, just like with Cash? Kappa
[3:43:23] <+soFISHticated98> every once in a while, strike backfires
[3:43:26] <rustedforks> he has to be last for a million turns before he can use the contract
[3:43:28] <glaciusinfinite> OOF
[3:43:29] <samuraijakanddaxter> woolie shouldn't have known it was the wrong cave either, it falls on chat either way
[3:43:30] <+soFISHticated98> which is good for gameplay and good for viewing
[3:43:33] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> wait...is Woolie running to the darkspace
[3:43:37] <+soFISHticated98> because it would suck if they were dead literally all the time
[3:43:37] <%viewtifulr> top left in lava cave
[3:43:38] <Infeirno23> the game is entertaining cause they are, i dont give a shit what they do it in
[3:43:41] <MaverickJoker> woolie doing it again
[3:43:41] <+soFISHticated98> that would not be entertaining
[3:43:44] <%jiggy_snipe> there is an obvious clue to where he's at lol
[3:43:45] <%Hawkbone_> @soFISHticated98 You clearly just don't understand.
[3:43:52] <MaverickJoker> and reggie kept falling for woolie's distraction plays
[3:43:54] <Klefth> It's really good
[3:43:56] <MaverickJoker> LUL
[3:43:56] <+Amaideus> He wants to backseat them to victory I guess
[3:44:00] <+soFISHticated98> oh yes, the intelligent man's argument
[3:44:02] <+That_Mojo> The whole poinnt is they have no idea what is happening in the game right?
[3:44:02] <+Amaideus> Because everyone loves when that happens
[3:44:04] <+soFISHticated98> I just don't agree with you
[3:44:08] <+soFISHticated98> I think your opinion is wrong
[3:44:15] <+pectusumbra> attack danube
[3:44:18] <+soFISHticated98> I don't think what you like is entertaining and that's it
[3:44:19] <%JetpackMcQuack> $1500 on the line man. Don't backseat.
[3:44:20] <gryffinp> i gotta say I don't get what woolie's plan is here

[3:44:33] <%Hawkbone_> @soFISHticated98 So why are you being a dick about it?
[3:44:33] <$legacy0117> This game, has a equalizer mechanic that can revert alllll of their progress whenever. We are lucky we haven't seen like, four darkling at this point.

[4:15:23] <Fujiwara_92> yeah, don't go for lost tech woolz, you don't have the pre requisites
[4:15:24] <Shishi1205> are not those cursed?
[4:15:24] <+soFISHticated98> but Minh's a hero
[4:15:28] <xXxDarkk213xXx> Mihn let this man take himself out of the game
[4:15:28] <%emperordread> You've been to the depths of despair, now go to the depths of the ocean and claim your Lost Tech
[4:15:29] <%jiggy_snipe> Minh got his current weapon from a red chest
[4:15:31] <%andrei11dr> Also Reggie could steal the kye from him
[4:15:36] <$legacy0117> If you go for Monk. Get it.
[4:15:43] <zocano> Ya Minh‚Äôs a hero just like Caim
[4:15:45] <SethKyu> Woolie is like 3 classes before he can use lost tech

[4:16:39] <Riottrio> Woolie is so close to that Dokapon Nihilism but is using it to be pessimistic.

[4:16:59] <aka_Jigawatt> @xx123manxx true
[4:17:02] <Riottrio> by realising that everything is temporary in Dokapon, you should learn to use what you have when you have it
[4:17:03] <+soFISHticated98> this is literally the plot to a rom com here

[4:17:16] <+soFISHticated98> man assigned to guard the princess instead takes her to a casino
[4:17:16] <%emperordread> Rescue Princess -> Go to Vegas -> Vegas Wedding -> Become Dokapon King
[4:17:17] <%Solidnick18> ooooo

[4:17:20] <Sol_Install> holy shit

[4:17:37] <Shishi1205> GET WEAPONS
[4:17:40] <powerprotoman> thats why you take a white chest
[4:17:41] <%shaidot> white chest
[4:17:41] <%purplehermit12> I would use it on a red chest tbh
[4:17:42] <+soFISHticated98> but she has to go back to being a princess and he has to go back to being a reporter
[4:17:43] <+gutlesscoward> oh man this is gonna be tragedy
[4:17:47] <Riottrio> use it on white chest
[4:17:48] <Fujiwara_92> Woolie don't go for lost tech, you don't have the pre requisites
[4:17:48] <%purplehermit12> or white chest
[4:17:49] <%purplehermit12> white ches

[4:17:58] <+gutlesscoward> don't go for it woolie, not yet
[4:18:01] <+thebeargoesHONK> lost tech is like 2-4 JOBS away
[4:18:14] <gryffinp> It seems like stealing the princess is higher priority right now
[4:18:16] <Riottrio> @fujiwara_92 that colour for your name is so bright on your name
[4:18:16] <%purplehermit12> The lost tech isnt going to be immediately useful for you, you'd have to master both Thief, and Alchemist in order to use it properly @WoolieVersus
[4:18:18] <%andrei11dr> Lost tech is for a class that is FAR away
[4:18:23] <%Th3SmartAlec> camp?
[4:18:25] <+Amaideus> Wait for em boiiii

[4:18:30] <+soFISHticated98> well thief has been mastered
[4:18:34] <%purplehermit12> Yeah he needs monk
[4:18:35] <+Amaideus> It's story mode
[4:18:37] <Riottrio> Woolie is right though, there is a chance for nothing good to be there
[4:18:38] <%jiggy_snipe> lol
[4:18:39] <+pectusumbra> @clueless_reaper it's story mode
[4:18:40] <sonofthedeepsouth> Woolie feelin like a lesbian heroine in a Rance game Kappa

[4:18:57] <%purplehermit12> No ninjas can use 2 items
[4:18:57] <C4m3r0n0409> What does it do
[4:18:59] <%jiggy_snipe> what's the Ninja ability?
[4:18:59] <+b_aleph> PUNCH EM
[4:19:00] <SethKyu> Ninja can use 2 items per turn
[4:19:03] <aka_Jigawatt> you can use 2 overworld items
[4:19:04] <%xx123manxx> You need to master the ???, Monk, Thief, Magician, and Cleric before even being able to USE lost tech @WoolieVersus
[4:19:08] <+MrAtheGreat> Go back to the castle and master another class! Fire Emblem this shit!
[4:19:09] <C4m3r0n0409> OOOO
[4:19:20] <clueless_reaper> @pectusumbra @3rdRunner beauty, thanks team
[4:19:21] <Amardeux> SEI FAHHH
[4:19:21] <+tearknack> woolies on the monk rotue i think?
[4:19:25] <+kekkerscrew> Double Spinners
[4:19:27] <+tearknack> whats he get from monk
[4:19:37] <+soFISHticated98> I love when the french starts leaking out
[4:19:40] <Shishi1205> Monk should be hype
[4:19:42] <%purplehermit12> Monks are powerhouses
[4:19:49] <+pectusumbra> Woolie has picked a top tier
[4:19:51] <crimsonsaens> It's on the mountain
[4:19:59] <%purplehermit12> they basically get bonus damage when they're low onb health
[4:20:10] <%purplehermit12> berserkers basically
[4:20:11] <Sunfrancisco> I just came in to the stream and for a second I thought Minh was wearing blackface
[4:20:12] <+Amaideus> And Woolie has a ton of HP
[4:20:13] <Infeirno23> go to masadora
[4:20:18] <+Amaideus> That's pretty solid synergy
[4:20:19] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> So hype for monk Pockets if it happens
[4:20:24] <gryffinp> Shadows are nature's blackface
[4:20:25] <SethKyu> Mage can use two nmagics
[4:20:28] <%agumon9000> 2 Field Magics was the magician
[4:20:29] <crimsonsaens> Two items, Magician gets two magics
[4:20:31] <aka_Jigawatt> pockets bout to be a punch girl
[4:20:34] <3rdRunner> I mean woolie was singing a confederate song an hour ago @Sunfrancisco
[4:20:38] <$legacy0117> He officially a Monk now? He is now Kenshiro with his own Stand. DO EET.
[4:20:44] <%jiggy_snipe> Nas - Be a Ninja too
[4:20:55] <crimsonsaens> Hero gets one of each
[4:20:58] <%agumon9000> no its not
[4:21:08] <%agumon9000> Its just two items. Magician can use two field magics
[4:21:10] <Shishi1205> rip respawn
[4:21:16] <Fujiwara_92> one of the requisites for lost tech is monk, right?
[4:21:16] <%agumon9000> and a ??? class can use item and magic
[4:21:20] <Teras_ode> good boe
[4:21:26] <$legacy0117> Aye.
[4:21:30] <+Amaideus> There was some salt in the middle

[4:55:18] <%purplehermit12> AND SKYROCKETED TO FIRST
[4:55:20] <wendisky> Mario party rules, lose till the end then win
[4:55:21] <%Irridium> fuckin' phased out like that dude next to Stalin
[4:55:23] <%purplehermit12> this is why reggie gangs the best
[4:55:31] <zocano> You can‚Äôt lose castles in Dokapon right? They‚Äôre hard locked?
[4:55:34] <lessthanhuman_tv> Is the VOD broken for anyone else? around 3:36 it starts skipping segments
[4:55:36] <+Amaideus> I'm agnostic, I'm just here for the chaos
[4:55:40] <%Naho_Saenoki> Darklings can steal castles.
[4:55:40] <+saltysteely> Reggie gotta win after this power play
[4:55:40] <%purplehermit12> pretty sure darkling can take castles @zocano
[4:55:41] <failboat13> Castle Super Beast: Unlimited Salt Works
[4:55:41] <%Livelinne> I need a real shonen redo of this
[4:55:42] <%Double_Tap_That> Reggie rockin'
[4:55:43] <soflicar> Yuo can lose castles
[4:55:44] <jeosadn> The break ends, and the camera fades into Woolie covered in blood, Reggie nowhere to be seen
[4:55:45] <ravenrooke> @lessthanhuman_tv its broken for me too
[4:55:45] <%Irridium> @chesterr01 let the voice of love take you higher
[4:55:46] <SheefEatsBeef> this is all because woolie picked strike
[4:55:48] <+InfiniteHav0k> @zocano only can steal castles while darkling
[4:55:48] <%Livelinne> Mood
[4:55:51] <%andrei11dr> @chesterr01 Are you sure, or is that Woolie tipping with the phone he stole from your corpse
[4:55:53] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> yo what song is this its hype af
[4:55:59] <%purplehermit12> Reggies got 2 castles now
[4:56:00] <Riottrio> @woolieversus just to correct misconceptions, Darklings keep their Castles and equipment, Rust will do nothing except reduced damage if you choose a magical defense option when it is fast
[4:56:02] <JXIalteisen> woolie ga shinda
[4:56:02] <+InfiniteHav0k> or by the king

[4:56:07] <nepwar> Woolie covered in reggie's blood, minh sandbagging the moment
[4:56:07] <Vortigon> RASHIDOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[4:56:08] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> RA SHIII DOOOO
[4:56:09] <MassConnect> this is all because woolie was afraid
[4:56:09] <+Amaideus> @abelincoln_catpuncher It's from MMX4, don't know which track though
[4:56:11] <jevichrono> And Minh looking at peace
[4:56:13] <%RioGascar> So @chesterr01 if we were to use an analogy what character would you say you are in this breaking bad/breaking dokapon show?
[4:56:14] <zenith0111> UNLEASH THE DARK HADO
[4:56:14] <+Kamennoo> @jeosadn right like the seat is empty and woolie acts as if nothing is wrong LUL

[4:56:17] <lessthanhuman_tv> @ravenrooke oh God I hope they're recording locally

[4:56:33] <nepwar> rashidooo
[4:56:33] <3rdRunner> Wow, this mix fucking sucks
[4:56:34] <%purplehermit12> @Riottrio the thing with rust is that It now gives them an excuse to want to/need to click m guard against reggie
[4:56:36] <%Double_Tap_That> REGGIEDOOOOOO
[4:56:36] <%Livelinne> Â°©üßÇ
[4:56:37] <ravenrooke> @lessthanhuman_tv yea they always do. They have to do sync tests all the time
[4:56:44] <zocano> Darkling is the path to victory
[4:56:51] <MassConnect> if it spins, reggie wins
[4:56:53] <Xeno351> if woolie gets lucky enough he can steal all the castles
[4:56:54] <3rdRunner> The DnB version of Rashid's remains the best
[4:56:54] <+saltysteely> Gonna cut back to Woolie covered in blood and Minh/Reggie just gone
[4:57:00] <nepwar> the turbulent wind is actually a sick moniker. i wish that i came up with
[4:57:01] <%andrei11dr> The game will fuck Reggie eventually, it's all just a matter of time
[4:57:02] <%Solidnick18> RASHIDOOOOOOOOOOOOOO duDudu
[4:57:04] <RurouniGeo> darkling is the only way back up to the top for woolie at this point. Both Minh and Reggie have built in win conditions due to stats or spells

[5:31:17] <kingkeldeo31> I'd go Mage just to screw over everyone else with their non-existent magic stats
[5:31:20] <Shishi1205> Only triples are bonus
[5:31:21] <C4m3r0n0409> its for tripple
[5:31:23] <+Gespens> only for a triple
[5:31:24] <C4m3r0n0409> triples
[5:31:27] <+soFISHticated98> Woolie literally has more magic
[5:31:29] <%jiggy_snipe> @kingkeldeo31 Woolie has decent magic
[5:31:30] <yeetdabsenpai69> triples
[5:31:33] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> ohhhh baby a triple
[5:31:36] <RurouniGeo> the game is telling you not to change reggie
[5:31:39] <Shishi1205> MONK UP
[5:31:40] <+nekodelic> reggie don't be stupid
[5:31:41] <+Dimfish> i looked away what just happend?
[5:31:41] <+soFISHticated98> like if he did it right now he would do no damage
[5:31:49] <Riottrio> It would take 4-5 level ups to catch up to Woolies magic
[5:31:50] <yeetdabsenpai69> @sofishticated98 but he isnt focusing on it
[5:31:50] <+Amaideus> It's an investment
[5:31:54] <+soFISHticated98> and he would continue to do no damage for like the next 2 sessions
[5:31:54] <whitemage4life> CorgiDerp CoolCat Kippa RalpherZ Keepo FrankerZ ScaredyCat RaccAttack DxCat BegWan InuyoFace SabaPing
[5:31:56] <Riottrio> and Rust is just as good without magic as it is with
[5:32:01] <+soFISHticated98> even if Woolie didn't focus on it
[5:32:01] <ravenrooke> BECOME MONK
[5:32:10] <%MisterArcanine> I think Reggie just doesn‚Äôt want to be the same class
[5:32:16] <+soFISHticated98> yeah he literally has the spell that doesn't need magic
[5:32:20] <%MisterArcanine> As other people
[5:32:26] <%jiggy_snipe> @MisterArcanine i think so too

[5:32:51] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> ugh
[5:32:51] <ashuckel> reggie can't steal
[5:32:52] <+soFISHticated98> Reggie should level magic to like 20 or 25 and stay there, but is shouldn't be a priority
[5:32:54] <Riottrio> stay in the castle loop
[5:32:56] <3rdRunner> p l e a s e
[5:32:57] <%MisterArcanine> Besides if Reggie masters magician he gets access to new classes too
[5:32:58] <ashuckel> go to green
[5:33:04] <+soFISHticated98> it should only be to provide decent protection
[5:33:07] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> woooolie become the punch queen

[5:35:46] <Zalthia> Is Reggie winning?

[5:36:37] <+Amaideus> I HAVE FAITH
[5:36:37] <dastmwolf> they played him like a damn fiddle
[5:36:38] <%ChoculaUltra> You've activated my trap ca-
[5:36:39] <Riottrio> @andrei11dr I don't think they do, no
[5:36:39] <CookieDoughFK> reggies worst fear
[5:36:39] <%Hawkbone_> Reggie for gods sake
[5:36:40] <Xeno351> but that actually the wrong move LUL
[5:36:40] <+nekodelic> REGGIE YOU
[5:36:42] <nepwar> you fool you imbecile you feel for the most basic trick in the book
[5:36:45] <+soFISHticated98> if you wanted magician you should have started as one
[5:36:46] <+Amaideus> Ya'll told him not to use the super spinner
[5:36:46] <Mirakei> Woolie's Mental has been completly guard broken LUL
[5:36:46] <%jiggy_snipe> leveling mage does get more classes so ok
[5:36:49] <+Amaideus> Look where we are now
[5:36:49] <Amardeux> the new continent opened guys LUL
[5:36:49] <+nekodelic> Don't you dare, reggie
[5:36:51] <C4m3r0n0409> WOOLIE CHANGE CLASSES
[5:36:53] <Riottrio> Now reggie back in first he's back to listening to the boys and making bad decisions
[5:36:53] <yeetdabsenpai69> loop
[5:36:54] <+Amaideus> Ninja is a dead end
[5:36:57] <+Joelexion> Woolz confirmed paranoid
[5:36:59] <+pectusumbra> to go become a monk woolie.
[5:36:59] <3rdRunner> MONK
[5:36:59] <%MisterArcanine> Well Reggie also has 30 levels of warrior shit so he‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs gonna be totally screwed
[5:37:03] <C4m3r0n0409> HES NOT A THIEF
[5:37:04] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> to become the punchgirl
[5:37:06] <%purplehermit12> @soFISHticated98 its not like his stats just fucking die out like what do you think he loses 30 levels in strength wth
[5:37:09] <+Dimfish> woolie should get the monk class
[5:37:09] <+pectusumbra> Or honestly it'd be better for woolie to be a mage or a wizard
[5:37:12] <+terry_quest> but he can break his shit
[5:37:18] <+soFISHticated98> no, but then he's going to be leveling his bad magic stat
[5:37:20] <C4m3r0n0409> He needs the roll
[5:37:20] <+Dorf1> if reggie masters mage he can work on becoming the hero closs
[5:37:20] <awildgooseappears> Resolved is being tested
[5:37:21] <Riottrio> you'll be fine woolie
[5:37:21] <Teras_ode> so become a monk...?
[5:37:21] <casualcthulhu11> you wouldnt
[5:37:24] <%jiggy_snipe> i don't think Reggie is trying to fight LUL
[5:37:26] <zenith0111> #ReggieIsHusbando
[5:37:26] <SethKyu> I mean, he can walk out fight you anyway
[5:37:28] <+soFISHticated98> while everyone else gets better at their good stats
[5:37:30] <RurouniGeo> the only reason you would change to magician would be to get spellsword class
[5:37:34] <C4m3r0n0409> Woolie is being a coward
[5:37:34] <Xeno351> what do you have to lose?
[5:37:35] <+soFISHticated98> you shouldn't become too well rounded
[5:37:36] <%Rhinoprotoss> Isn't Reggie lower level???
[5:37:38] <Riottrio> Woolie doesn't have magic defense atm does he?
[5:37:39] <+PunJ0hn> reggie would definitely break his shit
[5:37:40] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> Woolie become the punch god
[5:37:42] <+soFISHticated98> you need to have focus stats
[5:37:43] <+Amaideus> He already gets free stats from mastering classes
[5:37:47] <Riottrio> oh no, he does.
[5:37:48] <powerprotoman> woolie reggie has zero reason to pick a fight with you
[5:37:54] <Akett> It's SamSho and Reggie'scrouching in the corner.
[5:37:57] <3rdRunner> @Rhinoprotoss reggie has a spell that breaks your weapons
[5:37:57] <Riottrio> Woolie can just use M guard and not have to worry about Rust
[5:38:01] <Mrthefro> Woolie is the guy who gets punch drunk from Sendo in Ippo
[5:38:01] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> I dont like seeing Woolie so broken :(
[5:38:03] <%jiggy_snipe> @soFISHticated98 tbh he needs better magic because enemies will rock you with magic
[5:38:05] <+PunJ0hn> reggie absolutely would break his stuff
[5:38:12] <%ChoculaUltra> if you're going to hell, just keep going
[5:38:16] <+soFISHticated98> he needs like 5 or 10 more magic
[5:38:16] <%andrei11dr> Also Woolie has shit loads of health and attack, he's totally fine
[5:38:20] <+soFISHticated98> then he can dump the rest into HP
[5:38:29] <Riottrio> also, Rust isn't guaranteed
[5:38:38] <C4m3r0n0409> Shouldve just attacked
[5:38:40] <%MisterArcanine> Minh also invests in his towns an insane amount which is why he‚Äôs still so strong
[5:38:41] <zenith0111> @powerprotoman I made my friends rage quit because I would constantly kill them to make sure they can't have turns LUL
[5:38:48] <+soFISHticated98> like magician does nothing in the near future for him because both Woolie and Minh have decent HP stats now
[5:38:51] <Shishi1205> Power poke has a instadeath oercent
[5:38:58] <$Rezca> Roast beef?
[5:38:58] <Picia000123> Woolie was a pro playing a noob basically
[5:38:59] <Amardeux> looks life feet
[5:39:00] <+soFISHticated98> so he's just gonna get junked on the counter
[5:39:02] <%Irridium> yeah y'all should do something about that
[5:39:04] <reonome> real estate tycoon minh
[5:39:06] <yeetdabsenpai69> DARKLING
[5:39:11] <Riottrio> Nvm, looked it up, Rust will break equipment if you don't use M Guard
[5:39:16] <+Amaideus> He still has most of his stats even after the swap
[5:39:21] <3rdRunner> Which already happened btw, Reggie got 9999'd by a Ninja in the first 15 minutes @Shishi1205
[5:39:24] <+nekodelic> reggie wanting to become a magician is frustrating as hell
[5:39:27] <Riottrio> but all they have to do is use M guard, Reggie can't one-shot them
[5:39:30] <+Amaideus> Going magician is a fine investment
[5:39:31] <Shishi1205> yeah that's why
[5:39:36] <chickenhunter> darklings can steal castles
[5:39:38] <coldfire0007> do it
[5:39:40] <Shishi1205> Woolie had an idea
[5:39:45] <lessthanhuman_tv> because DARKLINGTON is funny to say :)
[5:39:46] <3rdRunner> YOU DON'T, YOU FOOL
[5:39:48] <%Hawkbone_> So does LITERALLY everyone else

[5:39:54] <+Dimfish> but you can make them lose all THEIR towns
[5:39:55] <coldfire0007> you steal towns
[5:39:55] <themightyseptopus> So does everyone else

[5:40:10] <coldfire0007> woolie is wrong
[5:40:11] <%Hawkbone_> MANY

[5:40:38] <+Amaideus> See, he literally doesn't remember
[5:40:39] <Riottrio> I knew they'd fall into the classic Dokapon trap. This false logic is completely why people never finish their first dokapon game, because Darklings are "not playing the game" when they really are

[5:55:30] <+MrAtheGreat> But woolie can‚Äôt get it because he touched 2nd for a bit.
[5:55:37] <yeetdabsenpai69> @omega6stars over 1k

[5:55:51] <+PunJ0hn> bloodpool is close to 2k actually
[5:55:53] <+soFISHticated98> that was OK
[5:55:56] <Vortigon> @Hawkbone_ implying anyone on team minh isn't rooting for the villain
[5:55:59] <+soFISHticated98> Woolie was 2nd place
[5:56:01] <+pectusumbra> Yo I'm not on team Minh, but that death race/hunt for Minh was fucking SICK

[5:59:23] <+PunJ0hn> hes going to do it
[5:59:24] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> I dont think Woolie can use the darkspace until the imp comes back
[5:59:32] <%xx123manxx> he needs the bat
[5:59:32] <3rdRunner> @hawkbone_ and he will, because that fuckin Wabbit is stronger than anyone on this map.
[5:59:37] <Amardeux> he needs to have the bat to follow him around first to use the darkspace
[5:59:38] <kingkeldeo31> That Wabbit is the true final boss
[5:59:39] <+PunJ0hn> woolie is going to flatten the earth

[5:59:51] <%purplehermit12> @Amaideus they do.
[5:59:57] <%purplehermit12> they multiply by the current chapter
[6:00:03] <Riottrio> @yeknomlive omg forgot that Killerfish had that, wow, that is so early too
[6:00:05] <MattDemers> I can't decide whether the overworld music is incredibly annoying or befitting of the chaos.
[6:00:07] <%xx123manxx> my dad works at woolie versus and told me reggie wins
[6:00:10] <%andrei11dr> Fear is the mind killer
[6:00:15] <RurouniGeo> From Dokapon kingdom wiki: DarklingEdit It becomes available when the user has been in last place for a long time (two weeks or longer) and the user reaches the Dark Space in Asiana.
[6:00:19] <+Omega6Stars> Anyone know how long they are from the game ending? ü§î
[6:00:22] <Amardeux> pray you get lucky lmao

[6:00:33] <Riottrio> @Omega6Stars they realistically aren't at the halfway point
[6:00:36] <%yeknomlive> you can turn darkling when you have the little imp above you

[6:04:29] <Amardeux> that way you wont get punted back to dokapon castle

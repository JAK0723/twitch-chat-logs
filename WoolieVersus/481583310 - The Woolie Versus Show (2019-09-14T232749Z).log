[0:37:48] <@Solidus_113> The 1st stream was all gameplay, the 2nd stream was base and norman management
[0:37:50] <DicksMcgeeDrinksP> darn
[0:37:51] <Kyrill_PSN> Plot twist: Death Stranding is actual Zone of the Enders Kreygasm
[0:37:51] <@Menitta> they put out 48 minutes
[0:37:52] <PinkSocks> lmfao amazing suit woolie
[0:37:55] <gustavozxd> i don't want to see the game, I want to play the game, so thanks Kojima, actually.
[0:37:56] <+ultimafullmetal> They showed 50 minutes of gameplay
[0:38:11] <%GohanEgret> @Kyrill_PSN don't I wish :(
[0:38:14] <steelmorrigan> where do I get this Onsie?
[0:38:15] <gustavozxd> Death stranding is a sequel to imouto Paradise
[0:38:16] <simulationbard> Seems to be a weird ass Mailman simulator. So about what I expected
[0:38:17] <shotgang86> I see that the trip to Japan was productive
[0:38:21] <Kyrill_PSN> Sry BibleThump
[0:38:22] <+BubbaRands> This game is either amazing or horrible
[0:38:23] <steelmorrigan> I WANT TO BE THE MECHA
[0:38:24] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> "haha walking sim, wheres the shootbangs?"
[0:38:25] <bear_breaker20> they showed emotes so im expecting some Journey asects
[0:38:27] <dmysta3000> It seems like a game that people are either gonna love or hate
[0:38:28] <Adwark> I recall hearing that Metal Gear Solid 2 was promoted only with Solid Snake, and then in real game we've got Raiden. And that was when Kojima had Konami handling him
[0:38:28] <Angry_Ev1L> it's MGS5 but worse Kappa
[0:38:30] <alexandrecau> 50 minutes of gameplay for a game that big doesn't mean much, like we don't know the different enemy type much
[0:38:31] <bear_breaker20> aspects*
[0:38:37] <TBFeric> I'm sorry D: D: D: D:
[0:38:43] <+EmiinV> kojima cares not about your feelings
[0:38:45] <+twohitgood> the game seems like it's going to be breath of the wild but with kojima's celeb buddies.
[0:38:47] <+arancet> i feel like TGS gave me that sense for death stranding... and unfortunately it looks bad
[0:38:50] <Adwark> And now Kojima while has support of Sony, they don't put leash on him.
[0:38:55] <Kyrill_PSN> man that hangar.... why kojima - so close
[0:38:55] <%GohanEgret> @Adwark yup, that's true, raiden was left out of marketing on purpose
[0:38:57] <deviljhojho94> bamboozled
[0:39:09] <gustavozxd> this is the guy that made mgs2, the game with the fake protagonist, don't forget.
[0:39:10] <sphereshots12> He loves fucking with people

[0:39:23] <Adwark> @GohanEgret I kind of wonder if Kojima isn't pulling again that kind of thing again
[0:39:25] <Ion_Laser> Nice
[0:39:30] <deviljhojho94> repping that vs

[1:08:26] <+jessedouglas> sekiro is pretty memorable to me. I got the platinum for it.
[1:08:50] <+Amaideus> I hated most of my time with Sekiro but enjoyed a few of the bosses
[1:08:55] <deviljhojho94> Fucking congalalas man
[1:08:55] <Hydrapissed> yah I remember it quite vividly over other things kinda hard to forget when the game makes ya focus
[1:08:56] <zamzoph> I just constantly run until he does an attack with a long winddown
[1:08:58] <MrCoinLaundry> Jesus. This is the first time I've even watched any gameplay of this
[1:09:02] <+primax104> did woolie ever start the claire B in re2make?
[1:09:02] <deviljhojho94> altough this would be a blangonga i suposse

[1:09:44] <+primax104> that is right disgusting that is
[1:09:47] <shotgang86> but let me refresh so I don't be the "ONE GUY"
[1:09:49] <+Amaideus> I know the first phase like the back of my hand
[1:10:03] <vanderbolt777> Does he knw?
[1:10:03] <+Amaideus> The sound was weird for me too until i reloaded the page

[1:10:44] <+logoth_> Enough
[1:10:47] <+Carpe_Deez_Nuts> Jesus I can't imagine the stress of having to fight a hard Sekiro boss after literally not touching it for over a month and being rusty with the mechanics. let alone with an audience of almost 1000 people.
[1:10:47] <%drefizz> wooliePOYO
[1:10:51] <Hydrapissed> they do throw shit lol
[1:10:59] <$FuqBoiSlim> Based Ape

[1:13:00] <SomeNEET> holy shit that's a cool enemy PogChamp
[1:13:01] <Hydrapissed> u gata parry them all to get the high one
[1:13:02] <MisterAngryEyes112> TERROR
[1:13:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> holy shit you're streaming again
[1:13:10] <haisho> OOF
[1:13:11] <TheyCallMeVawn> Just go for parries
[1:13:11] <razdoop> oof
[1:13:12] <SomeNEET> are all the bosses like this? I thought it was all swordbros
[1:13:12] <+logoth_> FRENZY
[1:13:13] <misterbarkley> do not like
[1:13:13] <Hydrapissed> ! TERROR !
[1:13:19] <%wydamn> @Amaideus lol I've never watched any LPs of this, and even I knew. Too many versions of that gif floating around.
[1:13:19] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> Is this the first branch woolie's gone down or the 2nd?
[1:13:26] <Hydrapissed> u can jump off him I believe to flip out of the aoe
[1:13:30] <+Amaideus> The scream is telegraphed way before you'd think
[1:13:32] <zamzoph> Woolie jumping forward ever LUL
[1:13:39] <+NoKingArthur> Do they know about the spear trick?
[1:13:40] <+Amaideus> If you react when it seems like you should it's too late
[1:13:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> glad to see woolie streaming again
[1:13:45] <%Afterman_> this boss teaches you how important it is to jump forward over shit
[1:13:49] <TheyCallMeVawn> Stop jumping
[1:13:55] <$FuqBoiSlim> How can one ape be so based
[1:14:01] <%hawk_rush> I could never read the sword attacks for this form
[1:14:02] <vVAstrAVv> woolie you can use the pot to clear terror buildup too iirc
[1:14:04] <%Afterman_> i cheesed the fuck out of him with the bellyflop
[1:14:07] <haisho> the timing on the swings are really weird
[1:14:14] <+Amaideus> I lamed the second phase out tbh
[1:14:15] <+gryffon95> also teaches you the requirement again of parrying
[1:14:17] <shadow1man9> It has a very obvious tell to get the fuck away, which is he puts his head back on
[1:14:20] <MisterAngryEyes112> Yeah wools is super rusty I can tell
[1:14:34] <+ArcanumMBD> @woolieversus his attacks change depending on if you block or party. if you consistently get 3 parries in a row he will do a big overhead slam
[1:14:37] <MisterAngryEyes112> Got a good coach by his side though :)
[1:14:38] <+logoth_> Good try for being rusty
[1:14:41] <TheyCallMeVawn> NEVER hold block
[1:14:44] <bleugh> Kappa
[1:14:46] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Despite the rust, he's pretty ok
[1:14:50] <%hawk_rush> yeah, you're doing alright!
[1:14:50] <%Afterman_> seriously just cheese him by baiting out the bellyflop
[1:14:52] <+Amaideus> Most enemies have changes based on which parts of their strings you're parrying
[1:14:52] <+wmeldrum> I had the most trouble with this BY FAR
[1:14:57] <Tucker0603> @WoolieVersus you're solid man
[1:15:03] <+jessedouglas> once you get the boss down he is pretty harmless. probably one of the most rewarding bosses in Sekiro, to me anyway.
[1:15:04] <Hydrapissed> Chain parry him
[1:15:10] <MisterAngryEyes112> Yeah I was being a little unfair, it was solid
[1:15:11] <Hydrapissed> Royal guard 2nd phase
[1:15:15] <duskrush> You know what gets rusty? ROBOTS. The onesie was a disadvantage
[1:15:20] <vVAstrAVv> youre doing fine except for pareies
[1:15:33] <razdoop> I can't believe that i had such a difficult time with Juzou but this guy i defeated in 4 tries, different people different problems i guess
[1:15:48] <+j_feezyy> atpCarl atpSuspect yovgAwkward
[1:15:49] <JetpackMcQuack> Attack his posture not his HP
[1:15:49] <Hydrapissed> yep
[1:15:53] <Hydrapissed> CHAIN parry basically
[1:16:06] <noobpsyboticus> I beat lady butterfly and genichiro easily but this boss took me forever
[1:16:09] <+ArcanumMBD> @woolieversus if you parry 2 hits in a row he will always do the overhead
[1:16:11] <+gryffon95> yeah, he is easier to beat with posture over hp.
[1:16:26] <vVAstrAVv> has mihn beat this?
[1:16:33] <%Lion_kun> Minh has platted the game
[1:16:37] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> his lack of spirit emblems is a shame for this though
[1:16:38] <+ArcanumMBD> use the spear thrust on his neck hole when he falls over too
[1:16:41] <NiktenKing> Minh did an upgradeless run of the game
[1:16:44] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> there are a lot of fun tools to use in this fight
[1:16:47] <%Lion_kun> woolie is doing really well without emblems
[1:16:47] <hassanico1> @ArcanumMBD he's totally out of emblems
[1:16:51] <vVAstrAVv> cool didn't know these were his thing
[1:16:53] <%Lion_kun> had he had firecrackers, he'd trivialize this
[1:17:00] <+ArcanumMBD> @hassanico1 rip
[1:17:00] <reonome> didn't woolie beat the ape already or am I crazy
[1:17:09] <razdoop> @noobpsyboticus Yo genchiro took me the same amount of time that used in ornstein and smough, he is so crazy
[1:17:10] <@Menitta> holy shit
[1:17:12] <Hydrapissed> yep its pretty fun cant wait for the 2nd one
[1:17:12] <NewAndTastyBigBlackPerv> After 100000000 years Sekiro is back Kreygasm
[1:17:15] <+Grayhammatter> wow, holy shit
[1:17:22] <MisterAngryEyes112> Minh has truly become SEKIRO: SHADOWS DIE TWICE
[1:17:25] <noobpsyboticus> hey Minh wasn't this the first souls type game you played?
[1:17:25] <IndoorSitup> DAM SON
[1:17:30] <TBFeric> Wow that's crazy different from how you play RPGs man !
[1:17:30] <JetpackMcQuack> Billy-sensei
[1:17:30] <+blastazoid26> Holy shit Minh
[1:17:32] <+TheSavageGrunts> happy go see your back on this been a while
[1:17:39] <+Amaideus> Literally a third of my game time is my trying to beat the last boss
[1:17:46] <+Amaideus> Man I love that dood
[1:17:47] <simulationbard> Sometimes I forget that Mihn's crazy about how he plays games
[1:17:49] <$cureneckbeard> 死
[1:17:50] <augusm> Minh thats a hell of a power move if I ever heard of one
[1:17:51] <+blastazoid26> Minh is the last Boss of this game
[1:17:58] <noobpsyboticus> i remember early on you said you weren't interested in souls but you expressed mild interest in this game
[1:18:00] <vVAstrAVv> im gonna shut up on my bitch advice then lol hes a pro
[1:18:00] <+ArcanumMBD> @amaideus yeah took me like 3 hours of constant attempts
[1:18:03] <Althenias> I just started palying this last night, im having trouble getting into it
[1:18:04] <MisterAngryEyes112> Sword Saint: HERE'S A FUCKING GUN
[1:18:11] <Hydrapissed> shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[1:18:17] <Althenias> i try to hard to play like dark souls
[1:18:24] <$cureneckbeard> yeyeye
[1:18:27] <absolute_cagemony> This is a terrible game to come back to after a break. This is a terrible boss to come back to after a break. Wools is on Insane difficulty right now.
[1:18:39] <razdoop> Man I couldn't parry this guy though, he is so wild
[1:18:43] <Hydrapissed> ehhhhh theres worst to come back to
[1:18:44] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:18:46] <hassanico1> @absolute_cagemony don't forget this is after weeks of Bayo and Astral Chain to boot
[1:18:51] <+gryffon95> much worse
[1:18:52] <%drefizz> Yeeeehaha
[1:18:54] <+Grayhammatter> nice dodge woolie
[1:18:55] <JetpackMcQuack> He's doing fine, relacc
[1:18:55] <Hydrapissed> yah
[1:18:55] <+Amaideus> @ArcanumMBD Dude's nuts, I had that first phase down pat though
[1:18:55] <NewAndTastyBigBlackPerv> Look at that ass PogChamp
[1:18:57] <MisterAngryEyes112> nah, wools is alright here
[1:19:01] <Hydrapissed> idk this seems like a good warm up for later
[1:19:05] <+Amaideus> Until I'd get punked one in every 12 attempts, lmao
[1:19:07] <mankeyfigh> LETS GO
[1:19:14] <HeadsHeldHigh> hit by the shit
[1:19:16] <hassanico1> Nice dodge!
[1:19:22] <%Wool> that's some big shit
[1:19:23] <+MrTAteMyBalls> uh oh, stinky
[1:19:26] <hassanico1> Yo these parries
[1:19:28] <%DeathsDoom> when he jumps up for that you can run right under him
[1:19:29] <razdoop> Look at Dat Monkey BUTT brucegFarded
[1:19:34] <+Amaideus> He doesn't have any follow ups after the grab
[1:19:37] <Hydrapissed> wall COMBOED
[1:19:37] <razdoop> Wut????
[1:19:38] <+gryffon95> oh boy that camera
[1:19:39] <shadow1man9> Have to run towards him to dodge that shit reliably
[1:19:42] <JetpackMcQuack> F
[1:19:43] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> Ah the greatest enemy in Sekiro appeared
[1:19:44] <Tucker0603> murder by camera
[1:19:44] <noobpsyboticus> tbh this shit is making me want to boot this game up again even though I beat it already
[1:19:44] <NiktenKing> Run towards the poop tbh the wind up is way too long
[1:19:45] <+gryffon95> F
[1:19:47] <MisterAngryEyes112> This fucking camera
[1:19:49] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> the fucking camera
[1:19:56] <%Tearonex> the greatest enemy of all, THE WALL
[1:19:56] <$cureneckbeard> 死
[1:19:58] <Tucker0603> i mean, for honor has that fixed
[1:19:58] <hassanico1> Use Candies?
[1:20:00] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @mankeyfigh
[1:20:05] <CrimsonGargoyle> the monkey cam gang
[1:20:12] <noobpsyboticus> the camera in this game is the worst of all the souls type games imo
[1:20:13] <MisterAngryEyes112> NO DEX
[1:20:16] <mankeyfigh> Astral Chain does have that PROBLEM
[1:20:18] <MisterAngryEyes112> All strength
[1:20:21] <MisterAngryEyes112> THE WALL
[1:20:24] <+bubbli97> that's the best thing For Honor did, making the wall behind you seethrought when you get too close
[1:20:24] <IndoorSitup> That's just fucking bananas.
[1:20:25] <noobpsyboticus> its really bad
[1:20:35] <%drefizz> woolieCHAN
[1:20:37] <+Grayhammatter> that wall is bad
[1:20:39] <razdoop> The camera on ds3 was worse
[1:20:44] <+gryffon95> all walls are bad in this fight
[1:20:45] <Nilbanas> I thought Woolie had finished this game o_o
[1:20:51] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> Sekiro's camera is especially cruel for how a lot of the enemies are fast or jumpy enough to deliberately break lockon and fly out of your camera
[1:20:57] <hassanico1> Chat remind me, this is Ingredient #3 for the Incense?
[1:21:06] <hassanico1> For Woolie at least
[1:21:08] <+Amaideus> In general or for wollie?
[1:21:09] <noobpsyboticus> ds3 doesn't require you to jump around like a crazy asshole tho
[1:21:09] <+Amaideus> Oh
[1:21:16] <+humbelpie> How long does it take to beat a FromSoft game?
[1:21:18] <loveplusearth> donkey konga 3 is fucking nuts
[1:21:25] <%Tearonex> woolieCHAN apatDab
[1:21:36] <JetpackMcQuack> Fart cancels
[1:21:37] <%CaptainPileDriver> yeah, ds3 only requires some real stupid shit in the dlc ringed city
[1:21:39] <+Amaideus> Typically 22-40 hours
[1:21:44] <razdoop> oof this is tuff
[1:21:46] <+Amaideus> Depending on the game
[1:21:48] <ScreamLord> Master Rank Congalala
[1:21:56] <+Amaideus> And how experienced you are with them in general
[1:21:58] <Nilbanas> @humbelpie 30 ish something hours
[1:22:02] <+gryffon95> if im not mistaken cant you just outrun the shit throw?
[1:22:03] <Adwark> @humbelpie depends a lot how experienced you are already in souls style games
[1:22:07] <+bubbli97> @humbelpie i think the souls games take 30-50 hours depending how well you know where to go
[1:22:10] <noobpsyboticus> @humbelpie it really varies a lot based on what game and your personal playstyle. ds2 took me 80 hours first time
[1:22:14] <Hydrapissed> u can outrun like everything in this fight lol
[1:22:15] <oiseaublanc> this boss is legit why I uninstalled this game
[1:22:20] <Hydrapissed> sekiro is freaking fast
[1:22:23] <noobpsyboticus> but I like to scrape everything
[1:22:24] <+Amaideus> You can run backwards from the shit throw or straight at him as he's running away for the windup
[1:22:32] <razdoop> Is even worth to parry Chat, i don't see a lot of posture damage
[1:22:37] <Adwark> @humbelpie and how quickly you learn, and if you use additional sources to learn about mechanics that aren't directly explained
[1:22:38] <%drefizz> ew the chunks off dookie
[1:22:42] <+gryffon95> yeah cause i think thats what i did. and yes parry is
[1:22:44] <%drefizz> of*
[1:22:50] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> side is crouching while running, yeah
[1:22:50] <+gryffon95> you just gotta keep parrying and dodge the dangerous ones
[1:22:52] <Nilbanas> Just run under him when he throws feces at you
[1:22:52] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> *slide
[1:22:58] <Hydrapissed> ehhh phase 1 parries are meh u can just hit him to death or firecracker / flamethrower him down
[1:23:02] <noobpsyboticus> @razdoop yes it is totally worth it bc you can get him in a stun state
[1:23:03] <JetpackMcQuack> The wall saved woolie there
[1:23:07] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[1:23:08] <+gryffon95> maybe im just remembering part 2.
[1:23:14] <HeadsHeldHigh> your posture will decrease but never break on a parry
[1:23:14] <Hydrapissed> phase 2 parries are perfect to do though
[1:23:23] <TCCBros> I feel like every stream i tune into for this game is this fight
[1:23:25] <+ThatOneGameTester> what if they shit instead
[1:23:32] <hassanico1> Traumatism via Rakishi
[1:23:35] <+ThatOneGameTester> that seems way worse
[1:23:37] <+gryffon95> i just remember hitting stage 2 for the first time and going "oh fscking great"
[1:23:47] <xeros720> every time pat stands up during a podcast, woolie feels dread
[1:23:49] <+gryffon95> oof
[1:23:51] <MisterAngryEyes112> One more!
[1:23:54] <+Amaideus> That grab is horseshit tbh
[1:23:55] <Nilbanas> Phase 2 is just parries yes, and you can use the lance to apply more damage once he's down
[1:24:00] <+gryffon95> you got this!
[1:24:00] <$cureneckbeard> 死
[1:24:02] <Ecchigun> you getting used to it woolie
[1:24:07] <razdoop> Some enemies and bosses have different posture gauges right?? Im so rusty in my Sekiro Knowledge
[1:24:09] <+gryffon95> its just getting the hang of it :3
[1:24:25] <+purps26> i had a really hard time with this boss
[1:24:25] <Hydrapissed> yep @razdoop
[1:24:38] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> The ape has such good ape-like animations
[1:24:49] <razdoop> @Hydrapissed Thanks my guy
[1:24:50] <+gryffon95> oh yeah they did a great job with animations honestly
[1:24:53] <noobpsyboticus> does woolie know about the fireworks?
[1:24:56] <+gryffon95> at least he blocked
[1:24:58] <Hydrapissed> parried the SHIT
[1:24:59] <+FlubbedPig> @WoolieVersus Remember, jumping attacks deal significantly less damage.
[1:25:03] <+gryffon95> woo~
[1:25:23] <$BappoSama> And we're back at the jumping all the time boys
[1:25:36] <razdoop> That is Bait, *Mad Max Gif*
[1:25:47] <ScreamLord> There is a way to skip the 2nd phase entirely but that's a spoiler
[1:25:47] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:25:56] <loveplusearth> hey woolie, run toward the shit!!!!
[1:25:56] <TCCBros> did you try killing him yet?
[1:26:06] <Tucker0603> quick question, if something unlocks on the 15th at 21:00 PDT, when is that in EST?
[1:26:15] <+gryffon95> yeah hes gotten to stage 2 if thats what you mean @TCCBros
[1:26:24] <shotgang86> shit in your mouth
[1:26:26] <+arancet> @Tucker0603 midnight
[1:26:34] <+kyh9> I just saw a western ad for Iceborne where an old lady holds a giant hammer
[1:26:35] <steelmorrigan> midnight
[1:26:40] <steelmorrigan> google...sir
[1:26:49] <Hydrapissed> lol
[1:26:49] <+gryffon95> moogle sir?
[1:26:49] <thewizardchan> Someone's anxious for their free SR
[1:26:55] <hassanico1> @WoolieVersus Do you have any Jizo in your inventory? You can use one after you die once to revive again during the fight
[1:26:56] <Tucker0603> fuck, guess i got 24 hours then....
[1:27:06] <+gryffon95> jizo isnt worth it on this fight honestly
[1:27:15] <+gryffon95> considering how few you get
[1:27:30] <thirst_patrol> sup everybody VoHiYo VoHiYo
[1:27:34] <%RioGascar> Thats a problem with this game
[1:27:34] <razdoop> Hit dat monkey butt for extra damage, that would be cool
[1:27:34] <Nilbanas> Run under him when he throws you shit Woolie!
[1:27:34] <+Grimlockfly> This guy
[1:27:40] <%RioGascar> Aw i wanna use this item
[1:27:42] <loveplusearth> hii @thirst_patrol
[1:27:45] <+gryffon95> ded
[1:27:47] <%RioGascar> But its so limited
[1:27:53] <%RioGascar> So i never use the item
[1:27:56] <+gryffon95> exactly
[1:28:00] <%RioGascar> Or it does fuck all like the arms
[1:28:02] <razdoop> oof
[1:28:10] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> jinzo
[1:28:10] <+FlubbedPig> If memory serves, to beat his leaping grab you should run away as soon as you realize he's in the air.
[1:28:11] <+gryffon95> they didnt plan out the jizo's well
[1:28:12] <hassanico1> Honestly there are like 3 situations I consider Jizo viable for
[1:28:15] <noobpsyboticus> @woolieversus hey Minh, since you played sekiro and liked it, will you go back and play the other souls games?
[1:28:15] <JetpackMcQuack> Grabs fucking hurt
[1:28:17] <+FlubbedPig> Not dodge, not jump. Run.
[1:28:21] <%RioGascar> to me this is probably fromsofts worst game as a whole
[1:28:25] <hassanico1> This boss, the boss in Fountainhead Palace, the Final boss, and the optional boss
[1:28:25] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> *jinzo's are better on NG+ where you get more
[1:28:27] <candidateplays> All grabs are anti-air in this game
[1:28:27] <bear_breaker20> Anyone else racing woolie?
[1:28:31] <%RioGascar> its parts are great
[1:28:32] <+gryffon95> running helps a lot this fight
[1:28:34] <%RioGascar> But as a whole
[1:28:35] <oiseaublanc> Sekiro isnt a Souls game
[1:28:39] <%RioGascar> Its really had
[1:28:43] <%RioGascar> i said fromsoft
[1:28:58] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Makes you wish you have more movement options
[1:29:21] <candidateplays> That's nonsense. Das2 is way clunkier.
[1:29:28] <+FlubbedPig> On his sweep grab I believe you can kick off his head for posture damage.
[1:29:35] <+gryffon95> movement options are pretty good in this game honestly
[1:29:41] <Hydrapissed> yah there are tons
[1:29:42] <MyNameIsRasus> its pretty good for "worst game"
[1:29:44] <candidateplays> And you're not even thinking of the dozens of other games they made before DeS
[1:29:49] <noobpsyboticus> I prefer das2 over this game as well
[1:29:51] <ThornJay> i wouldn't call it the worst at all. it's definitely unforgiving if you can't adapt to the specific playstyle though.
[1:29:55] <%RioGascar> Sure its clunkier but it doesnt have a lot of decisions that just weigh it down
[1:29:56] <oiseaublanc> @candidateplays that's true. Das2 is objectively the clunkiest
[1:30:11] <+Reizie_Etherealm> It's enough to work with, but if there's more then I can only imagine the possibilities
[1:30:17] <ThornJay> Like I can underdtand why some souls fans wouldn't like it
[1:30:26] <+Amaideus> DS2's way less clunky than 1 though
[1:30:29] <razdoop> OOF, this is my second favorite fromsoft game
[1:30:33] <+gryffon95> i totally agree its a good game, not great, but not terrible
[1:30:35] <+Amaideus> Gamefeel wise at least
[1:30:42] <+FlubbedPig> Run back from the leap.
[1:30:51] <%RioGascar> Theres a lot of bad decisions in this that really just make me not like it at all
[1:30:53] <+Amaideus> Oi Woolie, Hesitation is defeat in Sekiro
[1:31:01] <+gryffon95> also greed for hits
[1:31:06] <Hydrapissed> idk the movment seems fine and u got plenty in sekiro really
[1:31:08] <Nilbanas> Final boss was my bane
[1:31:13] <+TopTieramisu> too deep inside OwO
[1:31:23] <+gryffon95> dunno if im on the final boss, but the one im on is rough
[1:31:25] <shadow1man9> I'm pretty sure DAS2 had a lot of decisions that weighed it down, like reducing your HP every time you died, permadeath on enemies, "locked" movement etc.
[1:31:26] <%RioGascar> fight wise this was easiest fromsoft game i played
[1:31:29] <+TopTieramisu> the final boss of sekiro is still great
[1:31:51] <%RioGascar> never got frustrated or had to change tactics like in ds or bb
[1:31:53] <+Amaideus> What do you mean by "locked" movement? I haven't seen that criticism before
[1:31:53] <noobpsyboticus> i just miss having build variety. ds2 had the best build variety by a long shot
[1:31:55] <thirst_patrol> elden rings, people?
[1:31:57] <+TopTieramisu> demon's souls is the easiest
[1:32:03] <%RioGascar> this just allowed me to bum rush
[1:32:03] <metalwater8> Final boss is dope. Even if it tore my ass open
[1:32:03] <Hydrapissed> idk man ds and bb I just smashed threw it
[1:32:07] <Hydrapissed> sooo to each their own
[1:32:09] <ergheisu> I just joined, how far has he gotten on monkey boss
[1:32:09] <giogio346> must be weird switching between a platinum and a fromsoft game
[1:32:11] <+Amaideus> DeS isn't a fair comparison, it was their first run
[1:32:15] <%RioGascar> and do the deflect spam and it worked
[1:32:20] <eldragon_1> @shadow1man9 ADP was the worst for me
[1:32:25] <+TopTieramisu> @Amaideus yeah, that's why it was the easiest
[1:32:27] <TCCBros> @woolieVersus you are doing great :)
[1:32:29] <+TopTieramisu> i didn't say it was the worst
[1:32:31] <noobpsyboticus> bloodborne is easiest... at least until the dlc
[1:32:32] <shadow1man9> Forgot about fucking ADP
[1:32:32] <IndoorSitup> Goddamn, this fight is some monkey business.
[1:32:34] <razdoop> I freaking loved playing through it, after dark souls 3 this felt like a breath of fresh air
[1:32:41] <eldragon_1> Not having access to a good roll was rough
[1:32:44] <$FuqBoiSlim> kepe goin
[1:32:49] <$cureneckbeard> 危
[1:32:50] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:32:51] <noobpsyboticus> I actually like ADP. it's a good idea
[1:32:56] <+gryffon95> cant get greedy with those swings
[1:33:00] <+Amaideus> I think DeS is the worst soulslike objectively even if I like a lot of the stuff about it
[1:33:00] <%RioGascar> tho i am bias, i stopped ds3 1 hr in cause i was wanting bb combat
[1:33:02] <Nilbanas> Bloodborne is till the best for me.
[1:33:03] <$FuqBoiSlim> River City Girls?!
[1:33:07] <+Amaideus> I have no desire to ever replay it though
[1:33:13] <%RioGascar> scree this shield shit get in there and do damage
[1:33:17] <+TopTieramisu> it's a shame sekiro isn't getting a dlc. fromsoft dlcs have always vastly improved the game
[1:33:20] <+FlubbedPig> Just sprint away from him when he leaps. Don't dodge, don't jump, just run. If memory serves you can straight up outrun his aerial momentum.
[1:33:24] <+Amaideus> ADP's a good idea, it's just that the base AGL is way too low
[1:33:24] <MyNameIsRasus> i just wanna main two greatswords again with the ds2 moveset
[1:33:25] <+TopTieramisu> BB is my goat fromsoft game
[1:33:28] <noobpsyboticus> das2 had so many good ideas that didn't come back for das3. it was a big dissapointment
[1:33:28] <shadow1man9> Gimpimg your rolls and healing speed to a stat to pump levels into was an awful idea
[1:33:29] <Make_me_mad> My problem was I feel like Nioh did everything I wanted from the Souls series.
[1:33:31] <oiseaublanc> I just really want a ninja game that hits a sweet spot between this and Nioh. like without the Diablo loot lol
[1:33:36] <$cureneckbeard> yeyeye
[1:33:38] <ergheisu> damn I joined too late
[1:33:42] <candidateplays> They had dual greatswords is DaS3
[1:33:46] <$cureneckbeard> you did it.
[1:33:47] <KamiiFlow> cameraman plz
[1:33:49] <Make_me_mad> I liked its take on the combat more than Bloodborne.
[1:33:49] <NarcissistCactus> no
[1:33:50] <Patzzki217> camera pls
[1:33:53] <thirst_patrol> LUL
[1:33:57] <eldragon_1> Also Soul Memory
[1:33:57] <$cureneckbeard> you defea-- OH NOES
[1:33:58] <NarcissistCactus> japanese camera
[1:33:59] <+TopTieramisu> nioh's level design and boring story tho
[1:34:00] <TCCBros> Just lame it out and punish that big swing
[1:34:01] <+Amaideus> Tbh DS2 gives you so many souls that the extra stats you "have" to level don't matter much flow wise
[1:34:02] <Tucker0603> Camera having a seizure
[1:34:03] <IndoorSitup> Too close.
[1:34:05] <Patzzki217> man the spear makes this fight so much better
[1:34:08] <%RioGascar> i think the game your looking for is ninja gaiden @oiseaublanc
[1:34:09] <+gryffon95> but nioh was so fun though
[1:34:10] <TheyCallMeVawn> He only big swings when you parry
[1:34:11] <noobpsyboticus> ADP is awesome. more interesting decisions for build. soul memory OTOH was the most retarded shit ever
[1:34:15] <razdoop> For me ds1 will always be the Best but sekiro is a close second though
[1:34:15] <ScreamLord> Why does Woolie have or use any Shinobi Tools?
[1:34:17] <Hydrapissed> he has to chain parry to ge tthe big swing ming
[1:34:19] <KamiiFlow> mixups son
[1:34:21] <Nilbanas> Use the spear Woolie!
[1:34:21] <oiseaublanc> @riogascar that's what I keep hearing! haha
[1:34:22] <haisho> you're remembering right Billy
[1:34:23] <+FlubbedPig> @WoolieVersus He only does 5 if you parry it, not block it.
[1:34:24] <Adwark> I found nice that Nioh had actually directly told story.
[1:34:24] <reiju_22> monkaS
[1:34:28] <Hydrapissed> The ai reacts on deflects
[1:34:28] <ergheisu> you have to perfect parry those, not block
[1:34:35] <+arbeh> 3 parries in a row to get the big swing IIRC
[1:34:36] <Hydrapissed> there ya go
[1:34:38] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> DS2 had a lot of choices that felt like extreme over-corrections for gripes people had in DS1
[1:34:38] <+ilpeggiore_> i destroyed this game just by playing defensive lol
[1:34:40] <Hydrapissed> GOT IT
[1:34:43] <+Grayhammatter> yeyeye
[1:34:44] <shadow1man9> You have to parry his swings, not just block
[1:34:45] <%blaccbird914> blaccbird914 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! glad to see your back
[1:34:48] <$FuqBoiSlim> based
[1:34:49] <candidateplays> This story was pretty directly told.
[1:34:51] <loveplusearth> PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[1:34:54] <IndoorSitup> POGGERS
[1:34:54] <+Amaideus> Nioh's story was pretty badly paced but it was easy to follow
[1:35:02] <%RioGascar> I found this game super easy, i just got in every enemies face and super aggressive
[1:35:03] <+bubbli97> Why does Woolie have no Spirit Emblems? Did he spend them all on the boss?
[1:35:12] <+Arkfyre> Does woolie have the spear?
[1:35:12] <+TopTieramisu> nioh's story felt like a very generic anime thing to do, reimagining historic events
[1:35:13] <reiju_22> monkaS monkaS monkaS monkaS
[1:35:15] <+Amaideus> He didn't have them when he started the session
[1:35:15] <+gryffon95> eyyy your getting it :3
[1:35:19] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Honestly I found phase 2 much easier than phase 1 at the end of it all.
[1:35:20] <%RioGascar> They always stopped their string after breaking my guard and then i just recovered
[1:35:21] <+TopTieramisu> throw in spirits and shit
[1:35:23] <%RioGascar> And cotinued
[1:35:25] <+cunningchaff> 2nd phase is SO much easier than first
[1:35:26] <oiseaublanc> @riogascar just swing away? I was probably too patient and defensive when I played
[1:35:31] <eldragon_1> I prefer the standard good roll of DkS1 and DkS3. Just didn’t like the idea of wasting points for I-frames
[1:35:36] <%ChoculaUltra> is ichimonji still the best move in the game
[1:35:46] <%ChoculaUltra> second only to the double ichimonji?
[1:35:47] <Nilbanas> The spear Woolie!
[1:35:48] <candidateplays> ? Ichimonji is great in the second phase.
[1:35:49] <haisho> the big strike has him snaking up
[1:35:50] <razdoop> I hate the comparisons made between this and Nioh, Nioh is obviously built more like a traditional souls game and this is feels os different
[1:35:51] <+ultimafullmetal> Spearing his neck stump does big damage
[1:35:51] <+gryffon95> i think spirit emblems are one of the worst things in this game
[1:35:52] <shadow1man9> Spirit Emblems help a shit ton though
[1:35:57] <Hydrapissed> ichimonji and the monk slam yah
[1:35:57] <%RioGascar> I have blood borne in me so I basically looked at defense and laughed
[1:36:03] <+gryffon95> and he could if he had emblems
[1:36:05] <+Amaideus> But ADP as a stat lets you have a good roll regardless of the type of roll
[1:36:09] <ergheisu> 2nd phase is easier, but only after you figure out when he screams
[1:36:14] <%RioGascar> If the next fromsoft game is like shield and shit
[1:36:15] <ergheisu> before that it's a pain
[1:36:20] <$FuqBoiSlim> Download Complete???
[1:36:23] <%RioGascar> i wont really bother
[1:36:24] <+TopTieramisu> there's ways to make shield better
[1:36:27] <Make_me_mad> Oh yeah, I wouldn't compare this game to Nioh at all. I'd say to me Nioh feels like someone building on Bloodborne.
[1:36:28] <Hydrapissed> its lord of the rings based so prob shields and shit
[1:36:32] <+TopTieramisu> souls games don't do defense as well as they could
[1:36:40] <ergheisu> DO COMBO, MONKEY
[1:36:40] <+FlubbedPig> @ChoculaUltra I honestly never touched ichimonji. Waaaay too slow for me. By my like, 5th Charmless playthrough I really only used the upgraded Nightjar Slash. Mobility was great.
[1:36:44] <+Amaideus> I hope Elden Ring is a lot like using Valorheart
[1:36:47] <+Amaideus> Active defense
[1:36:47] <razdoop> @Make_me_mad Totally agree
[1:36:52] <noobpsyboticus> it's not "wasting" points for I frames, unless you consider I frames a waste
[1:36:53] <%RioGascar> I wanna have ability to throw shield
[1:36:56] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> Does woolie have some rice?
[1:36:57] <eldragon_1> @amaideus but you had to put points into it. That’s what I didn’t like
[1:36:58] <hassanico1> I love this thing's movements so much
[1:36:58] <%RioGascar> And just get in there
[1:37:00] <candidateplays> This game does defense amazingly
[1:37:01] <+TopTieramisu> in fact, sekiro does defense way better than souls
[1:37:02] <%RioGascar> And fuck em up
[1:37:12] <TheyCallMeVawn> why not parry the swim?
[1:37:21] <Make_me_mad> I just wish that the Souls games didn't put such a heavy emphasis on dodging over guarding, especially as the series went on.
[1:37:25] <ergheisu> parry does nothing on swim, knocks you away
[1:37:25] <+TopTieramisu> the problem for me is that there isn't enough penalty for getting your poise broken in sekiro
[1:37:26] <noobpsyboticus> also in dks3 the roll is insanely overpowered. they pretty much ruined it
[1:37:32] <ergheisu> better to jump and get a hit in
[1:37:33] <Make_me_mad> It felt like playing a tank got infinitely less viable from 1 to 2 to 3.
[1:37:37] <valriot> USE THE SPEAR ARM
[1:37:38] <$Rezca> this might be it
[1:37:40] <Make_me_mad> And then just wasn
[1:37:40] <hassanico1> If only he had emblems for Spear at this point
[1:37:45] <razdoop> well done woolie you are doing great
[1:37:46] <hassanico1> @valriot no emblems dude
[1:37:46] <Make_me_mad> wasn't an option at all in Bloodborne.
[1:37:47] <$FuqBoiSlim> The ape has been read???
[1:37:52] <+Amaideus> That's more because healing got more restricted as time went on
[1:37:52] <+gryffon95> there is a penalty, its just most people would rather not let it happen @TopTieramisu
[1:37:52] <+FlubbedPig> @valriot He has no spirit emblems. Somehow.
[1:37:59] <pibbleton> I believe in Woolie.
[1:38:00] <VJdarkworld> @ChoculaUltra ichimonji or senpou kicks depending on your playstyle. tho the kicks were better than ichimonji on 1.0
[1:38:00] <tri3dgE027> Loaded Spear would have been good here
[1:38:02] <+Amaideus> You can facetank fine in all of them if you build towards it
[1:38:08] <valriot> @hassanico1 oh right, that terrible design mechanic
[1:38:10] <hassanico1> @FlubbedPig he used them all on firecrackers the last time he fought this
[1:38:16] <%RioGascar> yeah with these fights i almost never gave the bosses a break
[1:38:16] <+Amaideus> It's just healing afterwards that sucks
[1:38:16] <bear_breaker20> I DID IT
[1:38:17] <+gryffon95> again guys, he has no emblems
[1:38:21] <+TopTieramisu> @gryffon95 nah, it's not enough. more often then not, you get to recover scott free while the enemy does nothing
[1:38:22] <noobpsyboticus> @make_me_mad THANK YOU! nobody else agrees with me on this. the balance was totally changed in ds3. so many builds were made non viable or had unique stuff removed
[1:38:22] <bear_breaker20> I JUST BEAT HIM
[1:38:25] <+Grayhammatter> yeyeyeye
[1:38:26] <%RioGascar> just keep hitting and you can stun em
[1:38:26] <TCCBros> You are doing great Woolie
[1:38:27] <Hydrapissed> HES doing it
[1:38:31] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> this is a good run
[1:38:35] <%Sh00s> Sh00s subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:38:36] <SixthSun2> PogChamp he's got it
[1:38:38] <eldragon_1> I remember the first time I rolled in DkS2 and I hated it lol
[1:38:41] <bear_breaker20> SENDIN MY ENRGY TO WOOLZ
[1:38:41] <+TopTieramisu> @gryffon95 personally, i feel like your bar shouldn't reset when your poise is broken
[1:38:51] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> ooof
[1:38:51] <Hydrapissed> THE BAIT
[1:38:51] <+Grayhammatter> Jebaited
[1:38:52] <$FuqBoiSlim> GET THAT FUCKING APE AHHHHH
[1:38:52] <%Sh00s> doodHokey_SG doodHokey_SG doodHokey_SG doodHokey_SG
[1:38:54] <alexandrecau> monkey baited
[1:38:55] <+FlubbedPig> @hassanico1 You say that, but in my playthrough I never ACTUALLY ran out of emblems. I had hundreds in reserve without even trying. That's what's confusing me.
[1:38:55] <+Amaideus> At least he has the extra revive
[1:38:56] <+gryffon95> eh i guess? maybe its just how i played but i always found that i got fscked, though i do agree with that @TopTieramisu
[1:38:59] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> aw

[1:39:05] <$FuqBoiSlim> AHHHHH

[1:39:36] <$FuqBoiSlim> woooooow the jap into super
[1:39:37] <Make_me_mad> The game inventing new tech to fuck woolie over in real time.
[1:39:38] <metalwater8> What was that?
[1:39:39] <tri3dgE027> That was new, may have been added on the update?
[1:39:40] <+Amaideus> New moves because it's at 25% HP

[1:39:53] <+gryffon95> forgot*
[1:39:54] <loveplusearth> GANBARE
[1:39:57] <+logoth_> You can do it!
[1:40:00] <razdoop> I like that they streamlined the gameplay, ds2 and 3 some builds feel some much stronger than others so it doesnt incentivise other and more weird playstyles
[1:40:16] <tri3dgE027> Never seen him do that slash-to-roar combo on my previous 5 playthroughs
[1:40:17] <+TopTieramisu> ds3 felt like bloodborne cosplaying as dark souls
[1:40:21] <+gryffon95> ive been away from the game for a while. especially now due to bl3
[1:40:26] <%RioGascar> Each time this thing screechs my dog starts looking around the room
[1:40:26] <reiju_22> monkaS
[1:40:30] <noobpsyboticus> ds2 was the most balanced game in terms of builds for sure
[1:40:31] <absolute_cagemony> This game's music makes me feel like i'm having a panic attack
[1:40:32] <%RioGascar> Hes freaking out
[1:40:32] <Make_me_mad> I actually prefer DS 2 to 3. Even with the myriad problems 2 had.
[1:40:37] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> nicceeee
[1:40:37] <hassanico1> @RioGascar it's a really animalistic noise

[1:41:08] <+Your_heals> This fight took me so many tries
[1:41:09] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> no spirit emblems for spears
[1:41:11] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Look at that. You got this.
[1:41:14] <$FuqBoiSlim> UHHHHHHHHH
[1:41:15] <razdoop> stripDizz stripDizz stripDizz
[1:41:15] <MyNameIsRasus> He's fucking greedy son
[1:41:17] <gustavozxd> you pressed the wrong buttoooooooon
[1:41:24] <worldbrand> are charge attacks worth it at all in that phase?
[1:41:31] <+buttdirt> fucking fromsoft man, always keeping you on your toes so you don't become comfortable
[1:41:31] <+TopTieramisu> this is one of the best bosses in this game
[1:41:33] <worldbrand> it's been so long since i've done this
[1:41:34] <+gryffon95> dont think so @worldbrand
[1:41:36] <+gryffon95> too mobile
[1:41:42] <+RayDaug> Hesitation is defeat, Woolie
[1:41:48] <noobpsyboticus> powerstance ALONE makes das2 better than 3 imo
[1:41:49] <+TopTieramisu> the surprise second phase is annoying, but it's still a great fight
[1:41:51] <haisho> @worldbrand only when he's down. Usually best to bust out spear though
[1:41:54] <+winds_0f_change> every age it seems is tainted by the greed of men
[1:41:59] <noobpsyboticus> such a good feature
[1:42:05] <dodgy_dingo_> hey fellas
[1:42:06] <eldragon_1> Powerstance was cool
[1:42:12] <Tersalus> poot
[1:42:13] <KamiiFlow> dookie
[1:42:13] <TCCBros> ASking, Attempt number?
[1:42:18] <+Amaideus> I like that you can infuse weapons that already do elemental damage in DS2
[1:42:19] <VJdarkworld> poop block saintrPoggers
[1:42:20] <+FlubbedPig> Holy shit, you can parry the poop?
[1:42:22] <$Rezca> gotta parry that poop
[1:42:22] <MyNameIsRasus> powerstance was the best
[1:42:23] <razdoop> Block that SHIT
[1:42:23] <+gryffon95> yep
[1:42:26] <+FlubbedPig> 'Cause I know you can't block it
[1:42:31] <+Amaideus> And there were so many weird weapons with movesets in DS2
[1:42:32] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> the best/worst thing about this fight is you'll get used to the moveset on one after doing really well on it and then the other phase plays the opposite way and you forget that after spending a while on one of them
[1:42:35] <Crossoflead> what a ridiculous move
[1:42:38] <+RayDaug> power stancing bother Smelter Swords in the Ice Golem armor for the Real American build was fun
[1:42:47] <+gryffon95> god i know that feel @A_Cat_in_a_Bat
[1:43:06] <Crossoflead> like am i supposed to be laughing at this enemy or scared of it
[1:43:08] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> yeah that was screwing me over hard on this fight in my run
[1:43:10] <Tersalus> his power move is..shittin in his hands and clapping?
[1:43:18] <+Amaideus> This is only Woolie's 8th try or so since he started again aint it?
[1:43:21] <+Amaideus> Not bad
[1:43:34] <zamzoph> I was too deep inside Kreygasm
[1:43:35] <hassanico1> @Tersalus going apeshit
[1:43:38] <TCCBros> he is doing well
[1:43:39] <+Grayhammatter> never go too deep inside
[1:43:39] <+TopTieramisu> the second phase isn't that bs though
[1:43:39] <worldbrand> this is one of the only games i can think of where the run where i get to beat the boss is about as good as the run right before it, and i've just learned the whole fight
[1:43:40] <+gryffon95> ngl whenever i messed up on the grab i just reset the fight
[1:43:41] <razdoop> I wonder how does the parry window in this boss feel, been so long since i beat the game
[1:43:46] <+TopTieramisu> second phase is easier than phase 1
[1:43:46] <TCCBros> 8 is good
[1:43:46] <MyNameIsRasus> woolie was kimochi ii
[1:43:48] <Tersalus> @hassanico1 eeeeeyy
[1:43:49] <Make_me_mad> If nothing else DS2 had the looking glass knight, and that's probably one of my favorite bosses in the whole Souls series.
[1:43:55] <worldbrand> style
[1:43:56] <Axle13j> oh shit, I showed up right on time
[1:44:02] <VJdarkworld> risk/reward paid off saintrPoggers saintrPoggers
[1:44:13] <$Rezca> I do like this ape boss, just not the second one
[1:44:15] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> double ichimonji is actually pretty good on his phase 1 stuns to build a ton of posture damage
[1:44:18] <hassanico1> I almost thought he grabbed a tree
[1:44:19] <razdoop> Best Boss: Abyss Walkers
[1:44:37] <haisho> yeah Ape has some surprisingly big openings in phase one
[1:44:40] <steelmorrigan> look at him going in
[1:44:40] <haisho> not in phase two though
[1:44:46] <MyNameIsRasus> looking glass knight was tight, but i'm more of a pursuer boy myself. gherman is the best fromsoft boss for me tho
[1:44:50] <%hawk_rush> what a solid first round!!
[1:44:54] <TCCBros> Best boss is thiss boss but not this fight
[1:44:56] <+gryffon95> yeah phase 2 is harder to read
[1:44:57] <+TopTieramisu> 2nd phase has the BIGGEST opening
[1:45:00] <+FlubbedPig> @Rezca Double Apes would've been fine if they were internally consistent and let the Whistle work on Ape Wife.
[1:45:00] <%Tearonex> here. we. go.
[1:45:00] <JetpackMcQuack> PogChamp
[1:45:06] <shotgang86> take a S I P
[1:45:08] <Hydrapissed> geeeeeeeeeeeee geeeeeeee
[1:45:08] <razdoop> Hey is it Abyss Watchers or Abyss Walkers, i forget
[1:45:08] <+gryffon95> Good job woolie! got so many sips left
[1:45:09] <steelmorrigan> You. Did it.
[1:45:11] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> yeah phase 2 is where you can't get fancy, just parry, parry, parry
[1:45:11] <eldragon_1> DkS2 also had a better character creator than all the other games
[1:45:11] <+RayDaug> I've never felt myself get good harder than in Sekiro
[1:45:15] <haisho> yeah but that's a spear opening not an Ichimonji opening
[1:45:17] <hassanico1> BTW that sword in its neck... is it Kingfisher's?
[1:45:18] <NeroInfinite> round 2
[1:45:20] <%RioGascar> Thats also its flaw
[1:45:24] <nervcells> look a this monkeyyy
[1:45:26] <Tersalus> howd the sword get in its neck in the first place?
[1:45:28] <alexandrecau> abyss watchers is the boss abyss walker is the art
[1:45:28] <Make_me_mad> Pursuer was also really cool. That hovering thing makes him feel threatening as hell.
[1:45:29] <%RioGascar> theres no replayability
[1:45:31] <worldbrand> nah not always, i fuck up bigtime in souls from one try to the next
[1:45:31] <%DeathsDoom> kills replay tho
[1:45:36] <noobpsyboticus> ds2 also introduced a lot of environmental stuff like pushing down trees, burning the windmill, etc. it wanted to do a lot more then ds3 did. ds3 just did ds1 again but not as good because shit poise and op rolls
[1:45:39] <+gryffon95> yep. once your done your done
[1:45:41] <hassanico1> @Tersalus it attacked a certain ninja and ate her
[1:45:41] <JetpackMcQuack> Bring out the horror violin
[1:45:56] <Tersalus> @hassanico1 neat!
[1:45:57] <+Reizie_Etherealm> I still can't believe how good Pat got by the end of this game
[1:46:01] <+Grayhammatter> yeyeyeye
[1:46:05] <absolute_cagemony> DS2 is a great game.
[1:46:06] <candidateplays> DS3 did the best fucking goddamn areas and bosses in the entire series
[1:46:06] <%hawk_rush> PogChamp perfect parry
[1:46:12] <razdoop> When the Abyss Watchers started fighting each other, that moment was so hype
[1:46:21] <+RayDaug> Sekiro: Shadows Get Good or Get Got
[1:46:25] <$FuqBoiSlim> Bait those parries woolz
[1:46:28] <worldbrand> he doin it
[1:46:30] <+Caped_Eggy> He's doing it PogChamp
[1:46:32] <%RioGascar> Its also quite forgettable
[1:46:32] <+TopTieramisu> bb's dlc > ds3's
[1:46:38] <hassanico1> god, Woolie's really missing out on the Spear parry moment, just cause it's so hype
[1:46:43] <%RioGascar> I beat it a week after launch
[1:46:43] <MyNameIsRasus> i mean ds3 also had the worst swamp area
[1:46:45] <noobpsyboticus> @candidateplays I totally disagree. ds3 has a lot of bad areas and bosses
[1:46:46] <$FuqBoiSlim> oh....
[1:46:49] <+Amaideus> Yeah but BB's dlc is 2 DLC's stapled together
[1:46:50] <+Your_heals> hes doing it kiiPoggers kiiPoggers
[1:46:51] <+Caped_Eggy> Nevermind
[1:46:51] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:46:52] <Axle13j> uh oh uh oh
[1:46:55] <+gryffon95> @MyNameIsRasus he has no spirit emblems
[1:46:57] <%RioGascar> and sorta remember nothing except final bos and this guy
[1:46:59] <absolute_cagemony> also confusing.... I still dont understand any of the centipede stuff
[1:47:01] <+TopTieramisu> @Amaideus and ds3 was literally 2 dlcs
[1:47:09] <TCCBros> Has he seen phase 3 yet?
[1:47:11] <noobpsyboticus> profaned capital is total garbage and so is demon ruins
[1:47:19] <razdoop> Hey don't get me wrong, ds2 is one of the weakest in the series but still rather play it than any other "AAA game"
[1:47:21] <+gryffon95> centipede has to do with like mythology and reincarnation
[1:47:23] <haisho> shh
[1:47:27] <KamiiFlow> profaned capital isnt even a full area
[1:47:28] <worldbrand> is it worth going for the posture damage this early in its health?
[1:47:28] <Hellarussian> YEYEYE
[1:47:28] <+gryffon95> dont remember it
[1:47:29] <tri3dgE027> There is no Phase 3 on the first Ape fight @TCCBros
[1:47:38] <TCCBros> spoilers
[1:47:38] <MyNameIsRasus> but ds2 also had a lot of bad areas
[1:47:42] <hassanico1> @absolute_cagemony Centipedes are basically a corrupt form of immortality
[1:47:45] <%RioGascar> I would say its worth going posture
[1:47:45] <candidateplays> And DS1
[1:47:48] <+Amaideus> They all have a bunch of shit areas
[1:47:48] <eldragon_1> BB honestly had the best DLC
[1:47:51] <+Grayhammatter> that's the do it woolie, keep calm
[1:47:57] <Crossoflead> all that for just a bit of damage whew
[1:48:02] <hassanico1> "Izalith Butt Valley"
[1:48:06] <+gryffon95> at least he noticed the wall
[1:48:07] <MyNameIsRasus> yeah they do all have bad areas, now that you say it
[1:48:07] <+Amaideus> BB's DLC saves that game for me tbh, the extra weapons are so nice
[1:48:07] <+TopTieramisu> BB's dlc: great areas, great lore, great bosses
[1:48:11] <Hellarussian> YEYEYE
[1:48:11] <VJdarkworld> BB honestly had the best everything
[1:48:15] <%RioGascar> my logic, if i keep hitting them they get stunned and then i TAKE AWAY A WHOLE BAR of hp. sure i may take some hits but i can get the fight done faster
[1:48:15] <+TopTieramisu> and great bosses
[1:48:17] <JetpackMcQuack> Doesn't even need the other gourd haha
[1:48:19] <+TopTieramisu> weapons*
[1:48:20] <Blank9> BB's dlc is so short though
[1:48:26] <haisho> too bad Woolie is out of emblems
[1:48:31] <haisho> spear makes this fight SO much shorter
[1:48:36] <noobpsyboticus> BB has pretty bad build variety. best atmosphere though
[1:48:40] <+Grayhammatter> yeyeyeye
[1:48:40] <+TopTieramisu> emblems are for cowards
[1:48:46] <hassanico1> It's probably the best tool use in the game @haisho
[1:48:46] <candidateplays> No, a single game's story is incomparable to a trilogy's.
[1:48:46] <shotgang86> yeyeyeyeyeye
[1:48:51] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> there is a consumable he could use that would help in phase 2 too
[1:48:51] <%RioGascar> man the emblems were really bad idea
[1:48:51] <Adwark> Of BB I most remember last chalice Dungeon boss needed for trophy.
[1:48:52] <+gryffon95> it can but this fight doesnt really need it.
[1:48:54] <Blank9> and honestly not very fun as an area, it makes me wish cainhurst castle was a dlc area
[1:48:57] <hassanico1> As in like, use of a tool during a fight
[1:49:05] <Blank9> because that was good
[1:49:06] <Adwark> That fight was so laughably easy with Threaded Cane
[1:49:07] <haisho> you have passed with flying colours, now pass the practical exam
[1:49:08] <+gryffon95> boy were they @RioGascar ran into the same issue in BB
[1:49:10] <+TopTieramisu> @candidateplays funny, because ds2 and 3's made ds's lore worse and worse imo
[1:49:18] <worldbrand> i was suuuper greedy in this fight
[1:49:19] <candidateplays> Maybe if Bloodborne gets two sequels, BB3's story will be as good as DaS3s.
[1:49:20] <Crossoflead> BB has some serious negatives even though I love it: practically no character NPc's to follow through the story and lack of build diversity
[1:49:21] <+gryffon95> ran outta blood. cant fight gascoquin
[1:49:28] <%RioGascar> which emblems? I don’t remember bb having limited
[1:49:29] <%RioGascar> Oh
[1:49:30] <+FlubbedPig> I still don't get why they made Emblems work like Blood Vials. I thought it was pretty fucking clear that Vials was a bad system, I don't see why they didn't see that. Emblems should've just been MP.
[1:49:31] <razdoop> The Boreal Valey was awesome (did i spell valey wrong, english is not my first language)
[1:49:32] <+winds_0f_change> but if he's not dead you haven't passed
[1:49:36] <+gryffon95> yeh. farming blood sucks
[1:49:37] <%RioGascar> Uhhh blood is what again
[1:49:41] <+gryffon95> your sips
[1:49:50] <hassanico1> @razdoop yeah it's Ls
[1:49:50] <Hellarussian> just lame it out
[1:49:53] <+gryffon95> so no blood = no heals
[1:49:53] <+Amaideus> Valley is 2 Ls @razdoop
[1:49:54] <%RioGascar> oh right
[1:49:54] <haisho> what's that smell?
[1:49:58] <+Amaideus> You were close
[1:49:58] <hassanico1> @razdoop two Ls*
[1:50:01] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> blood vials being limited stock was brutal in the early game, yeah
[1:50:02] <alexandrecau> minh you'Re a ba influence
[1:50:03] <MyNameIsRasus> farming blood is easily the worst part of bb
[1:50:06] <tri3dgE027> Laming it up like X Tekken Kappa
[1:50:06] <eldragon_1> BB really only had build diversity if you went for Dex
[1:50:10] <VJdarkworld> woolie's got this B)
[1:50:15] <zamzoph> Hesitation is Defeat
[1:50:16] <noobpsyboticus> OMG I forgot about blood vials. that was so stupid
[1:50:19] <+Amaideus> Or Arcane, but it takes forever to get decent gems for it
[1:50:22] <razdoop> Thank you all chat, you da real DEAl
[1:50:25] <hassanico1> Honestly Arcane and Bloodtinge were brutal for early game
[1:50:28] <Blank9> even in build variety BB plays very similar most of the time
[1:50:30] <eldragon_1> Most of the Str weapons were terrible
[1:50:31] <+TopTieramisu> hesitation is defeat
[1:50:31] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> Hesitation is DEATH
[1:50:32] <+enickma11> Hesitation is defeat
[1:50:34] <%RioGascar> like formsoft reallt seems to want limited use items
[1:50:38] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> everything is death
[1:50:41] <%IMDRanged> After so much "drop your shield" "perfect" Woolie's definitely got this.
[1:50:42] <tri3dgE027> "Hesitation breeds defeat"
[1:50:42] <+bubbli97> Hesitation is Defeat
[1:50:44] <%RioGascar> But they uh...make them limited for vital items
[1:50:44] <Blank9> mainly because R1 is your mash-for-damage and R2 was your charge attack
[1:50:48] <%Tearonex> he's getting slightly too greedy
[1:50:49] <alexandrecau> overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer
[1:50:50] <+gryffon95> limited items can work, just not vital stuff for mechanics
[1:50:52] <Hellarussian> destiny is destiny
[1:50:58] <zamzoph> "Hesitation will get you killed." -Isshin
[1:51:01] <%RioGascar> Hey you wanna use your powers? YEAH well fork up some emblems
[1:51:02] <+gryffon95> like health or basic item use
[1:51:07] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> Anger leads to suffering
[1:51:08] <IndoorSitup> "Don't be a fucken pussy." -- Sekiro
[1:51:09] <Chester_goes_Berserk> Still have a soft spot for Demons' for being the most chill, it doesn't try as hard to kill you as the others
[1:51:13] <worldbrand> oh these feints
[1:51:16] <+TopTieramisu> "keep pressing buttons, idiot"
[1:51:18] <+gryffon95> @RioGascar oh you ran out? guess your fucked fighting some of these bosses
[1:51:18] <haisho> I can't remember if Woolie has the Purple Gourd. Does he?
[1:51:21] <Blank9> demons has the most unique bosses too
[1:51:23] <%RioGascar> Hey you wanna heal? yeah...just use these limited use blood vials
[1:51:24] <+Amaideus> He does
[1:51:26] <VJdarkworld> i woulda preferred if BB dropped the RPG building all together and let you just use whatever ya picked up.
[1:51:27] <hassanico1> @haisho he does, he used it before
[1:51:28] <worldbrand> he used it about a minute ago
[1:51:31] <+gryffon95> he does @haisho
[1:51:35] <%RioGascar> As memed as it got
[1:51:43] <%RioGascar> the estus flask was good
[1:51:49] <hassanico1> Here we go, good to go
[1:51:49] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Woolie is fucking doing it!
[1:51:53] <+Amaideus> DS1's healing system is the best
[1:51:54] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> Goo woolie goooo
[1:51:55] <+gryffon95> hence why they brought it back here, yet still used emblems :I
[1:51:59] <Crossoflead> @VJdarkworld tbh think I agree
[1:51:59] <%RioGascar> balance your use and improve its quality and quantity
[1:52:00] <$FuqBoiSlim> HES GOT EM NOOOW
[1:52:01] <tomcatmcgee> nice, I'm only an hour and a half late 👌
[1:52:05] <+gryffon95> id rather just have "you get x uses from each item
[1:52:05] <haisho> problem with second phase is that he essentially has custom combos and you gotta be prepared for the variation in timing
[1:52:08] <Thirtine> yeyeyeye lest goooooo
[1:52:09] <worldbrand> the nervous crouch
[1:52:09] <pibbleton> I picked a good time to show up!
[1:52:11] <Blank9> most fun weapon in BB was tonitrus for the fun of managing the buffing/durability
[1:52:13] <$FuqBoiSlim> DOWNLOAD COMPLETE

[1:54:11] <MyNameIsRasus> octoNa octoNi
[1:54:12] <%RioGascar> and it worked so...ehhh???
[1:54:21] <haisho> roughest part of second phase is his weird custom combos but so many of his moves have a weird startup so you can adapt to them
[1:54:22] <$NoWayRyanTatum> dang did I miss the Ape fight?

[1:57:09] <+gryffon95> nah just ignore the statue you'll be fine
[1:57:13] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> that's a portal to Yharnam
[1:57:13] <+FlubbedPig> @WoolieVersus Wrote this down from last stream. Go tell Anayama that the samurai want Salt.
[1:57:13] <BigNerdSam> You killed the ape so hard its soul is bleeding
[1:57:15] <SixthSun2> The lore is ghost STDs
[1:57:16] <absolute_cagemony> tainting the lake with thuggery
[1:57:18] <worldbrand> G H O S T B L E E D
[1:57:33] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Sad lonely ape :(
[1:57:33] <worldbrand> what's that blood? it's smell
[1:57:35] <$Rezca> hey man, apes get lonely too
[1:57:40] <+TopTieramisu> this is the link that ties together the sekisoulsborne universe
[1:57:45] <+gryffon95> what do you think he was doing sitting there?
[1:57:45] <VJdarkworld> ape :(
[1:57:51] <+gryffon95> he was "lonely"
[1:57:52] <%drefizz> woolieHM
[1:57:55] <SixthSun2> worm?
[1:57:55] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> theres actually 3
[1:57:55] <zamzoph> there's like four ways in this game
[1:57:56] <haisho> the ending is literally LEMME SMASH
[1:58:01] <hassanico1> The Centipede immortality is supposed to be corrupt and disgusting
[1:58:02] <+DRAGKUDO> Woolie has to go
[1:58:03] <+FlubbedPig> No you can't.
[1:58:05] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> the other one is the water
[1:58:10] <SixthSun2> If the centipede goes you die
[1:58:15] <doggieo> By cutting your head off
[1:58:15] <+whiskey_wolfe_> "I prefer the worm." Woolie Madden, 2019
[1:58:20] <bear_breaker20> the bugs breed faster than you can ri the out
[1:58:20] <+FlubbedPig> Taking out the centipede will fucking kill you, dude
[1:58:23] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> basically the Dragon kid's immortality is the purest
[1:58:24] <hassanico1> Remember though Kuro can't bleed
[1:58:27] <worldbrand> His point is that there's an exit to immortality and you don't have to go out like Kars
[1:58:30] <KamiiFlow> Ganado type immortality
[1:58:35] <absolute_cagemony> Woolie is another one of these fools who hates immortality for some reason
[1:58:36] <candidateplays> You're literally trying to get the wat out
[1:58:39] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> everything else is an incomplete byproduct
[1:58:40] <Hydrapissed> yep always need a way out
[1:58:41] <+TopTieramisu> yank my worm
[1:58:47] <JetpackMcQuack> Just pull the worm out
[1:58:52] <+DRAGKUDO> and the worm takes over
[1:58:57] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> Your body still seems to rot and get all gross after a while with the centipedes too
[1:59:00] <eldragon_1> That didn’t work out for Shinnok LUL
[1:59:01] <haisho> wait when did Woolie know that Hanbei has a worm
[1:59:03] <+DRAGKUDO> it's a parasite
[1:59:05] <Hellarussian> just yank it
[1:59:07] <Tucker0603> nope
[1:59:09] <+FlubbedPig> Worm breeds in your gut
[1:59:10] <+gryffon95> nah doesnt seem like it
[1:59:10] <%drefizz> you pull it out you die
[1:59:13] <+FlubbedPig> Can't take out all the eggs
[1:59:15] <caol2017> Its just like pulling a tooth
[1:59:15] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> The monks got all nasty at least
[1:59:19] <+TopTieramisu> does anyone remember the bloodletting beast in the chalice dungeons?
[1:59:20] <hassanico1> @WoolieVersus Speaking of the worm, you can use the SPEAR tool to pull the worm from the Ape's neck in Phase 2
[1:59:27] <+TopTieramisu> more specifically, the headless one
[1:59:28] <haisho> oh right
[1:59:28] <%RioGascar> I think the work also corrupts you
[1:59:28] <+FlubbedPig> @WoolieVersus Wrote this down from last stream. Go tell Anayama that the samurai want Salt.
[1:59:30] <%RioGascar> So...
[1:59:31] <zamzoph> D:
[1:59:33] <%RioGascar> Nah son
[1:59:35] <haisho> damn it's been a long time since I've watched Sekiro
[1:59:36] <Hydrapissed> and u talk to him at the start lol
[1:59:52] <haisho> I like how he hasn't realized
[2:00:01] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Ape bride :(
[2:00:03] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> So is the second ingredient woolie's grabbed? Or first?
[2:00:08] <ScreamLord> @WoolieVersus You can skip the 2nd phase of the Ape entirely if you use the Mortal Blade on the worm before it wakes up
[2:00:08] <hassanico1> 3rd
[2:00:10] <Hydrapissed> he ded now
[2:00:11] <%galaxyswirl> you killed a horny monkey, you monster
[2:00:12] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> He was waiting for girl ape : (
[2:00:16] <%RioGascar> I think the worm like does something similar to a lobotomy so...yeah big no
[2:00:16] <VJdarkworld> poor ape BibleThump
[2:00:18] <zamzoph> PepeHands
[2:00:19] <%RioGascar> I’ll take death

[2:02:54] <+Keyd00d> that's not true?
[2:02:55] <+FlubbedPig> No, you can attract human attention.
[2:02:55] <haisho> it works on humans too but enrage is on beasts only
[2:02:58] <Hydrapissed> nah it works on humans
[2:03:00] <+Calek> it 100% works on humans
[2:03:02] <worldbrand> You can attract humans, it just doesn't make them crazy
[2:03:03] <+FlubbedPig> Humans will hear. Beasts will enrage.
[2:03:03] <Graxe_> They do work on people, they just don't get enraged and go crazy
[2:03:06] <$BappoSama> @WoolieVersus Minh, you're so wrong it hurts..
[2:03:06] <%RioGascar> man I forgot everyone except the castle boss the monkey boss and final boss
[2:03:07] <razdoop> Crazy Talk
[2:03:08] <TCCBros> it works on doods
[2:03:08] <+Keyd00d> woolie is correct
[2:03:09] <$Rezca> it enrages animals, but can attract humans attention
[2:03:11] <caol2017> thats right
[2:03:15] <Tucker0603> woolie is correct
[2:03:16] <+FlubbedPig> Woolie is correct
[2:03:16] <TCCBros> correct
[2:03:17] <Hydrapissed> attacts people and beast get pissed
[2:03:18] <hassanico1> @WoolieVersus It attracts attention of Humans but Drives Beasts insane
[2:03:23] <JetpackMcQuack> Just try it out haha
[2:03:25] <candidateplays> Minh is pitching a real no hitter right now
[2:03:30] <+linSP> woolie is reicht
[2:03:31] <+Keyd00d> welp
[2:03:40] <haisho> it's better plates but remember, you gotta burn emblems

[2:04:54] <Hydrapissed> up one lol
[2:04:54] <+gryffon95> up
[2:04:55] <%Aidrya> Aidrya subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:04:57] <haisho> third row down
[2:04:58] <TCCBros> up4
[2:05:02] <hassanico1> @WoolieVersus Look for Malcontent
[2:05:10] <%galaxyswirl> BEST TOOL
[2:05:15] <TCCBros> ^
[2:05:16] <%galaxyswirl> MALCONTENT BEST
[2:05:33] <JetpackMcQuack> ECHOES
[2:05:34] <+FlubbedPig> Malconent is VERY useful for Headless
[2:05:35] <haisho> yeah it's great for kiting enemies
[2:05:40] <haisho> but Malcontent is where it's at
[2:05:50] <hassanico1> @WoolieVersus If you are feeling extremely ballsey there is something you can do in Ashina Depths now that Guardian Ape is defeated
[2:05:54] <+FlubbedPig> Read Malcontent better
[2:06:00] <haisho> read the description of Malcontent carefully
[2:06:03] <Graxe_> Malcontent has a different first description
[2:06:04] <ScreamLord> @WoolieVersus It can stun some Bosses
[2:06:05] <haisho> it's actually HUGE
[2:06:09] <%RioGascar> Again...emblem system reallt gimped the whole arm system
[2:06:16] <0rond> @WoolieVersus read the malcontent again, you missed a big part of it
[2:06:18] <%galaxyswirl> read malcontent again @WoolieVersus
[2:06:23] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Read Malcontent's description
[2:06:29] <+FlubbedPig> @WoolieVersus Malcontent stuns ghosts instead of enraging beasts. It's good for Headless.
[2:06:41] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> emblems really should have just refreshed on a sit at an idol
[2:06:43] <+gryffon95> also a shame the headless really dont give you much
[2:06:47] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> without needing to buy more
[2:06:49] <%RioGascar> Yep
[2:06:50] <+gryffon95> and yeah they should have
[2:07:00] <%RioGascar> Like the ds1 estus
[2:07:03] <0rond> @WoolieVersus read the malcontent again, you missed a big part of it.
[2:07:03] <Tucker0603> @a_cat_in_a_bat he's got none
[2:07:04] <VJdarkworld> @RioGascar after getting (redacted item) its honestly not that bad. but the system really shoulda been based around it
[2:07:06] <+gryffon95> just let the upgrades increase the uses and that thats.
[2:07:12] <%RioGascar> Where you can have your starting bonfire
[2:07:15] <%RioGascar> That gives 10 estus
[2:07:25] <%RioGascar> But if you go to the other ones gotta up the bonfire
[2:07:33] <%RioGascar> If you wanna keep the 10
[2:07:41] <+gryffon95> yeah that could work too
[2:07:43] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> @Tucker0603 I know he has 0 emblems, I was griping about how grinding for emblem money sucks
[2:07:53] <%RioGascar> Or you cna use consumables to add extra to your bonfire amount
[2:07:58] <0rond> @WoolieVersus read the malcontent again, you missed a big part of it.
[2:07:58] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[2:07:58] <+DRAGKUDO> you can get everything by the end
[2:08:01] <+FlubbedPig> Reread Malcontent
[2:08:05] <noobpsyboticus> emblems should just be recharged when you rest honestly
[2:08:08] <hassanico1> Fan
[2:08:17] <noobpsyboticus> it's so pointless
[2:08:18] <%galaxyswirl> malcontent is so good
[2:08:24] <%RioGascar> so you are given say...20 but you can use a consumable for an extra...10???
[2:08:33] <hassanico1> Chat should he go to Ashina Depths right now?
[2:09:00] <0rond> @WoolieVersus read the malcontent again, you missed a big part of it
[2:09:06] <+Caped_Eggy> Is ashina depths the only place left?
[2:09:07] <%RioGascar> If there was any game that needed a schoalrd of furst sin
[2:09:12] <ScreamLord> apatWrong
[2:09:13] <%RioGascar> Its this game
[2:09:13] <$Rezca> can we eavesdrop here?
[2:09:15] <%RioGascar> And a rework
[2:09:21] <hassanico1> @Caped_Eggy I meant for the optional thing, he has all 3 ingredient
[2:09:22] <VJdarkworld> @noobpsyboticus technically you can, with a risk/reward item
[2:09:24] <%galaxyswirl> @Rezca yes he can eavedrop
[2:09:47] <+Caped_Eggy> @hassanico1 what optional thing?
[2:09:52] <%RioGascar> Cause theres just a few small isuses that make this game frustrating as well
[2:09:59] <hassanico1> @Caped_Eggy a thing that only spawns after Ape is dead
[2:10:09] <%RioGascar> but it has no replay value...so it’s probably not worth it
[2:10:14] <+FlubbedPig> @WoolieVersus Reread Malcontent. What Minh is referring to is that Malcontent stuns ghosts INSTEAD of raging beasts.
[2:10:15] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> the upgraded umbrella would be nice if you're going for base stuff
[2:10:22] <+Caped_Eggy> @hassanico1 Oh the other one?
[2:10:27] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> or the fan for the upgraded fireworks
[2:10:28] <hassanico1> @Caped_Eggy that one
[2:10:50] <+Caped_Eggy> @hassanico1 Up to minh really LUL
[2:11:05] <%galaxyswirl> i was about to ask if mihn forgot about the eavedrop here
[2:11:06] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> he just sold lol
[2:11:08] <alexandrecau> eavesdrop and peek
[2:11:31] <%RioGascar> Still 0 clues what purpose bute down has
[2:11:32] <noobpsyboticus> what ending are we going for boys
[2:11:33] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> NotLikeThis
[2:11:34] <+FlubbedPig> Economics, baby
[2:11:35] <shotgang86> woolie!
[2:11:35] <%RioGascar> Seems like a waste
[2:11:38] <+linSP> STONKS
[2:11:39] <MurlinDurl> sup woolz finally caught you live
[2:11:43] <+Reizie_Etherealm> NOT STONKS
[2:11:44] <+Caped_Eggy> It's investment guys
[2:11:56] <RupanSen> at the end of the day we're all gonna die anyways
[2:12:02] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> I would have invested in another shinobi too or emblems but eh whatever
[2:12:09] <+linSP> WHOS THAT GUY IN THE WINDOW
[2:12:09] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> *tool
[2:12:17] <xeros720> cackling minh is a good sound
[2:12:18] <candidateplays> Helps against certain enemies in the final area, lets you preserve resurrection use if you think you're going to die anyway
[2:12:24] <%RioGascar> I actually like the pouch system
[2:12:26] <hassanico1> FORESHADWOING
[2:12:26] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> hey look at that orange ninja in the hole, is he listening to us?
[2:12:37] <Hydrapissed> The FLAMESSSSSS
[2:12:43] <%RioGascar> store all your money in a pouch to not lose it on death
[2:12:43] <alexandrecau> orangutan
[2:12:46] <%galaxyswirl> poor ninja monkey man
[2:12:54] <+FlubbedPig> @WoolieVersus Sculptor is known as Orangutan or Sekijo, which like Sekiro means something along the lines of "One-Armed Ape"
[2:13:00] <Slim_Lipid> 👂👂👂👂👂 can you speak up
[2:13:08] <MurlinDurl> reminds me of the giant carving things in darksouls 1
[2:13:12] <candidateplays> Yo, go talk to him again
[2:13:13] <+Keyd00d> tang
[2:13:13] <shotgang86> is this an Oblivian conversation?
[2:13:20] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> I could go for some Tang now
[2:13:25] <天使42199> cmonBruh ?
[2:13:25] <dmtjinni> ghost!
[2:13:28] <RupanSen> "have gunpla tu build, goodbye"
[2:13:28] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> wow racist against monkeys
[2:13:29] <Slim_Lipid> 🐒
[2:13:32] <%galaxyswirl> mihn laughing inside
[2:13:42] <alexandrecau> librarian: Not a monkey
[2:13:46] <DeathByPoke7> is he goku
[2:13:47] <+Amaideus> Monkey business
[2:13:50] <+Amaideus> I'll just say it
[2:13:52] <noobpsyboticus> so basically he fucked the ape
[2:13:55] <+Amaideus> He's got some monkey business
[2:13:58] <hassanico1> Locked Places hmmmmm
[2:14:03] <MurlinDurl> aids zero patient
[2:14:04] <+FlubbedPig> @WoolieVersus when you gave him Monkey Booze he mentioned that he trained in the valley with the monkeys.
[2:14:09] <Professor_Rakor> He trained in monkey town, the story he told you when he drank monkey booze.
[2:14:10] <oiseaublanc> "monkey clan connection " largest yikes
[2:14:12] <%RioGascar> Now are monkey lovers worse than horse lovers
[2:14:18] <candidateplays> Yeah, you already knew that
[2:14:22] <Slim_Lipid> rmzEVIL2 🐒
[2:14:29] <Professor_Rakor> And all the ninjas get animal names.
[2:14:30] <VJdarkworld> yes
[2:14:31] <%RioGascar> What is worse animal lover type
[2:14:31] <%galaxyswirl> he could be a monkey
[2:14:35] <+DRAGKUDO> yes
[2:14:37] <Tucker0603> he's a former shinobi
[2:14:38] <$FuqBoiSlim> Vape Ape
[2:14:39] <+Amaideus> GET SOME EMBLEMS
[2:14:41] <Professor_Rakor> Since they don't keep real names.
[2:14:45] <+FlubbedPig> You won't find out. You already have all the info, you just learned it months apart at a time.
[2:14:46] <%RioGascar> Is he a monk....ey
[2:15:00] <Slim_Lipid> lore ResidentSleeper
[2:15:00] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:15:09] <+linSP> you require additional fire emblems
[2:15:11] <Huntercd> Hidden monkey village in the valley? We Naruto?
[2:15:11] <hassanico1> @WoolieVersus All the Shinobi have animal codenames is all
[2:15:18] <$FuqBoiSlim> LMAOOOOO
[2:15:40] <hassanico1> Phantom Butterfly, Owl, Wolf, Orangutang...
[2:15:44] <worldbrand> i hardly used them so i always had them
[2:15:45] <+FlubbedPig> There is no swing point. And the monkeys are not down.
[2:15:48] <noobpsyboticus> Buddha finger
[2:15:55] <+Caped_Eggy> No monkies are up
[2:15:58] <haisho> best use of leftover money is to spend em all on Emblems when you aren't spending em on purses
[2:15:59] <+linSP> theres monkies above and below
[2:16:09] <worldbrand> the group is above
[2:16:12] <%RioGascar> i used em sparingly cause man...thw cost isnt worth the effect
[2:16:13] <+Caped_Eggy> The bunch of monkies are up
[2:16:13] <天使42199> cmonBruh
[2:16:17] <Slim_Lipid> monkey sandwich
[2:16:31] <+Caped_Eggy> You might have to come from the other way
[2:16:41] <chronoxgp> he might as well explore its' the last area..
[2:16:50] <+FlubbedPig> They are exactly where Woolie was looking when he said "They were over there somewhere". You go to the Sculpture immediately after the lake where the snake chased you.
[2:17:17] <hassanico1> Chat Woolie has both Viscera right?
[2:17:21] <%RioGascar> Did he go in cave
[2:17:22] <haisho> gotta get closer
[2:17:25] <Professor_Rakor> Are we on monkey genocide quest?
[2:17:52] <hassanico1> He had the Green Gourd you bought I think
[2:17:55] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> The monkey blood lust will never end
[2:17:55] <Slim_Lipid> Joe Rogan's favorite side quest
[2:18:00] <%RioGascar> Ou right
[2:18:06] <%RioGascar> The “sickness”
[2:18:09] <chronoxgp> do you know how strong monkees are?
[2:18:12] <%RioGascar> how toothless that was
[2:18:18] <Patzzki217> @Slim_Lipid LUL
[2:18:46] <+FlubbedPig> @WoolieVersus Something you missed. the difference with Malcontent ring is that it stuns ghosts. Great for Headless.
[2:18:49] <hassanico1> Do Monkeys drop money?
[2:18:59] <Professor_Rakor> Maybe some do?
[2:19:04] <SixthSun2> What would monkeys need money for?
[2:19:07] <Professor_Rakor> Not enough to be interesting.
[2:19:07] <%RioGascar> that sounds like a slow way
[2:19:15] <hassanico1> IIRC monkeys drop ceramic shards
[2:19:18] <chronoxgp> monkeys trade sex for favours lol
[2:19:32] <chronoxgp> they also settle wars that way
[2:19:34] <%galaxyswirl> malcontent ring also stuns other things too not just ghosts
[2:19:39] <+FlubbedPig> ... but they're headless
[2:19:42] <+FlubbedPig> Wrong way.
[2:19:47] <%RioGascar> So when the fight club is over the winner gets sex?
[2:19:49] <+Caped_Eggy> Not this way
[2:19:54] <hassanico1> Malcontent is used for one very specific encounter other than Headless as well
[2:19:58] <+FlubbedPig> Go forward from the idol, opposite the lake
[2:19:59] <+linSP> this is when the snake ate the bridge
[2:20:12] <haisho> you can dive but you might not want to
[2:20:31] <%RioGascar> Okau so he can dive...god i forget this whole game
[2:20:34] <+FlubbedPig> This is how you get into the valley in the first place
[2:20:43] <chronoxgp> the monkey did a plunging attack lol
[2:20:52] <%RioGascar> where does woolie even have to go next
[2:20:58] <hassanico1> @RioGascar Ashina
[2:21:04] <%RioGascar> ...
[2:21:08] <%RioGascar> Where???
[2:21:10] <hassanico1> @RioGascar Castle

[2:21:44] <%RioGascar> Im being serious, so ty
[2:21:54] <hassanico1> Yeah we're just trying to avoid spoiling

[2:22:33] <%RioGascar> i am trying to remember this game and even maybe the path woolie has to go

[2:23:59] <%RioGascar> Where dill gets grabbed by monkets
[2:24:01] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> woolie is only making one go wild because he's locked on
[2:24:02] <+Grayhammatter> don't lock on woolie
[2:24:02] <chronoxgp> here we see the 30fps monkey and the 15fps monkey in their natural habitat

[2:24:11] <Solidus0101> Big chimpin
[2:24:11] <%supersugoisenpai1> Only the targeted enemy gets frenzied
[2:24:11] <Hellarussian> they're moving in like 7 dimensions
[2:24:13] <noobpsyboticus> he was locked on
[2:24:13] <%RioGascar> And the music is like OH Ey ah ah TING TANG walla bing bang

[2:24:41] <+linSP> guys i think he locked on pogonaThink
[2:24:43] <Railgun5> @WoolieVersus Locking onto a target makes it effect only them, turn off the lockon and try again
[2:24:49] <%galaxyswirl> @WoolieVersus you were locked on , it lasts for longer
[2:24:57] <shadow1man9> @WoolieVersus You locked on one guy when you used it
[2:24:58] <+DRAGKUDO> it's too late guys
[2:25:01] <hassanico1> just move on with the story or the optional content

[2:25:16] <haisho> dont forget to pick up Monkey Booze
[2:25:17] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> he already killed them once and got the booze, I think
[2:25:21] <haisho> welp
[2:25:23] <%galaxyswirl> it does last for a while
[2:25:24] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> It's VERY situational anyways
[2:25:32] <Professor_Rakor> he got the booze the first time through
[2:25:32] <haisho> did he? Who did he give it to?
[2:25:33] <shotgang86> he missed monkey booze?
[2:25:37] <+FlubbedPig> You can tell Anayama about the Salt now if you want. You never did last stream.
[2:25:38] <shotgang86> oh ok
[2:25:49] <haisho> my memory is very bad
[2:25:51] <+DRAGKUDO> there is two monkey booze though

[2:26:33] <%RioGascar> Okay wait
[2:26:33] <Graxe_> Geese Howard invades Ashina

[2:26:39] <+Caped_Eggy> I loved this part
[2:26:48] <chronoxgp> ah man i missed the monkey fight
[2:26:51] <hassanico1> @WoolieVersus Ask Minh about an optional thing in Ashina Depths
[2:26:57] <+FlubbedPig> Teleport to Dungeon Entrance
[2:27:00] <%RioGascar> it was pretty alright if annoying
[2:27:24] <+Grayhammatter> shit's locked
[2:27:31] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> a mystery is afoot...
[2:27:32] <haisho> time to see what this LOCKDOWN is all about
[2:27:38] <+FlubbedPig> No, that's later
[2:27:38] <+Amaideus> He's throwing a sick party
[2:27:39] <%Lion_kun> woolie, you should upload a save file at this point so you can do both choices
[2:27:39] <zamzoph> Boy needs his space
[2:27:44] <Professor_Rakor> It's probably the monkeys.
[2:27:44] <Tucker0603> is Minh gonna help woolz get the best ending?
[2:27:52] <+gryffon95> he tipped over a candle
[2:27:53] <+Caped_Eggy> BOI
[2:27:55] <%Wool> BOI
[2:27:59] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> the monkeys are getting their revenge
[2:28:06] <%Wool> lol Ashina Depths time
[2:28:06] <haisho> are we allowed to go full Wakka on the monkeys?
[2:28:11] <%RioGascar> candles dont get enough fear
[2:28:14] <oiseaublanc> ubzTilt
[2:28:16] <zamzoph> @Tucker0603 which one is that? Kappa
[2:28:17] <noobpsyboticus> honestly this part was kind of annoying to me. it's like "oh, we don't need a new area, let's just repop the shit"
[2:28:21] <%RioGascar> Tip it over and its all going up in flames
[2:28:25] <+FlubbedPig> Ashina Depths, poison pool
[2:28:37] <+FlubbedPig> hidden forest works too
[2:28:39] <oiseaublanc> PorscheWIN
[2:28:45] <Futurecity10> Poison pool would have been better
[2:28:46] <hassanico1> yessssss
[2:28:48] <haisho> technically doesn't lock out
[2:28:48] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> Pool does have the cooler stuff in it
[2:28:49] <Graxe_> Tekken your way through Sekiro
[2:28:51] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> but eh
[2:28:54] <candidateplays> No, this part is great.
[2:28:56] <haisho> but this is gonna be great
[2:29:05] <Tucker0603> @zamzoph the one that endings with something Randy pitchford would like
[2:29:06] <hassanico1> Minh is leading him to the thing
[2:29:14] <eldragon_1> Just use a fightstick Kappa
[2:29:14] <%RioGascar> i think I forgot this part
[2:29:14] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[2:29:16] <haisho> night is the worst
[2:29:16] <%RioGascar> Maybe
[2:29:18] <+FlubbedPig> Going there from Poison Pool you get to see all the structures are torn down and there are gunners bleeding out

[2:30:58] <+gryffon95> LUL LUL
[2:30:59] <+FlubbedPig> It's him, Minh.

[2:31:01] <$rytyoung> He mad for you killing you the first time
[2:31:02] <Professor_Rakor> It is a him.
[2:31:02] <+whiskey_wolfe_> IT'S A HIM MINH JEEZ
[2:31:05] <NiktenKing> Can't escape crossing fate!
[2:31:05] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> this is Him
[2:31:06] <%fatal_penguin_> Is the frame rate bad for anyone else?
[2:31:08] <+DRAGKUDO> he's still wrong
[2:31:08] <candidateplays> It's the same Ape, Minh.
[2:31:10] <NDenizen> You know him well.
[2:31:11] <SomeNEET> wtf another one?
[2:31:12] <Tucker0603> it's him minh
[2:31:13] <shadow1man9> It's the same Ape
[2:31:15] <+FlubbedPig> In fact, it's the SAME guy
[2:31:19] <KumaTorey> ghost ape
[2:31:20] <Slim_Lipid> HotPokket
[2:31:20] <+function_2> Sekiro PogChamp
[2:31:21] <socratetris> THE WHEELS?OF FATE ARE TURNING
[2:31:21] <%RioGascar> how is it the same one
[2:31:25] <+Grayhammatter> it's the same ape mihn
[2:31:28] <noobpsyboticus> the fact that it's the same ape kind of makes no sense
[2:31:29] <+gryffon95> yup. this monkey dont go done for no one
[2:31:30] <+FlubbedPig> He doesn't count as beast anymore
[2:31:32] <hassanico1> Save the Whistle
[2:31:32] <haisho> it will work on wife
[2:31:36] <%Wool> how will whistle work if the ape has no ears
[2:31:36] <haisho> won't work on husbando
[2:31:41] <NiktenKing> spear?
[2:31:41] <hassanico1> hehehe...
[2:31:43] <candidateplays> It makes perfect sense. Sekiro didn't use the Mortal blade
[2:31:45] <+FlubbedPig> @haisho actually doesn't. It really sucks.
[2:31:58] <hassanico1> @NiktenKing he doesn't know about that move
[2:32:04] <haisho> jesus my memory must be really shotty
[2:32:05] <ScreamLord> All those squishy grape jelly sound effect WutFace
[2:32:06] <shadow1man9> @noobpsyboticus He's one of the infested, so he's unkillable outside using the Mortal blade
[2:32:11] <%RioGascar> mortal blade??? Oh rigth uh that thing
[2:32:11] <NiktenKing> :/
[2:32:16] <+gryffon95> i think he technically did @candidateplays , i think its just assumbed
[2:32:18] <noobpsyboticus> yea but... he did use the mortal blade
[2:32:27] <+FlubbedPig> @WoolieVersus If you use the spear's pull attack on his neck stump when he falls over you deal MASSIVE damage and stagger.
[2:32:30] <socratetris> no mortal blade means ape just gets up and walks away later
[2:32:36] <%RioGascar> i wish all video games had a “: hey do you forget this entire game? Heres a story summary
[2:32:41] <+function_2> chat does he know the scream tech?
[2:32:41] <+Dragoneye77> how does a headless monkey have posture though imaThink
[2:32:45] <%RioGascar> yakuza has thar

[2:33:03] <+linSP> NEW CHALLENGER
[2:33:03] <Aydarkzero> HERE COMES A NEW CHALLENGER!
[2:33:03] <NDenizen> Monkey Trouble begins
[2:33:03] <TheyCallMeVawn> THE REAL FIGHT STARTS NOW
[2:33:05] <thirst_patrol> PogChamp PogChamp
[2:33:05] <$FuqBoiSlim> OOK OOK MOTHERFUCKER
[2:33:05] <+Grayhammatter> there's the waifu
[2:33:05] <hassanico1> DOUBLE MONKEY
[2:33:05] <%supersugoisenpai1> Surprise motherfucker
[2:33:06] <+FlubbedPig> @gryffon95 That's enough for a couple pulls, yeah.
[2:33:07] <Professor_Rakor> MORE MONKEYS PUNK!
[2:33:08] <Hydrapissed> REAL APES
[2:33:19] <+gryffon95> didnt know, never used the spear tbh
[2:33:21] <Graxe_> Final Round
[2:33:24] <candidateplays> He didn't use the Mortal blade. Sekiro stabbed the centipede with KiSabiumaru. IN fact, he'll stay alive after this fight unless you use the Mortal Blade
[2:33:25] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> Now this is some real monkey business....
[2:33:25] <Solidus0101> APE OUT JR
[2:33:26] <+linSP> does the whistle actually work on the other ape
[2:33:27] <thirst_patrol> they roll deep
[2:33:34] <+Kenzo2000> YOU DIDN'T WIN
[2:33:35] <$Rezca> so if there was a fourth battle, would their children be involved?
[2:33:37] <+FlubbedPig> The whistle sadly does not work on Ape Wife
[2:33:38] <hassanico1> @WoolieVersus try whistle on Brown ape?
[2:33:39] <%Tearonex> O AND S
[2:33:39] <a_mad_dragon> just win 4Head
[2:33:43] <+FlubbedPig> It really sucks, 'cause it SUPER should
[2:33:44] <Professor_Rakor> She's....going ape.
[2:33:45] <$rytyoung> YOU LOSE
[2:33:47] <Hydrapissed> Going APE SHIT
[2:33:48] <haisho> they take turns
[2:33:50] <oiseaublanc> yeah this is on the "never reinstall" list now
[2:33:51] <TCCBros> F
[2:33:53] <hassanico1> oh sorry chat, didn't know
[2:33:53] <%RioGascar> Oh so woolie has no chance
[2:33:56] <ISkyHunterI> The zombie ape is the female
[2:34:03] <%RioGascar> Since no mortal blade
[2:34:04] <%fatal_penguin_> Woolie, try to remember some of the basics of CQC
[2:34:13] <hassanico1> The Brown Ape is super weak though
[2:34:21] <zamzoph> they're most certainly individually less aggro
[2:34:24] <RupanSen> usually they don't attack contemprarily
[2:34:26] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> He's got the mortal blade, but what would be good right now is something that say.... scares animals
[2:34:29] <$cureneckbeard> oof another one of these guys
[2:34:30] <socratetris> Woolie must learn the ways of Laming it Out. Embrace Cowardice! it is your strength!
[2:34:31] <TwinBat> this is fine
[2:34:37] <ScreamLord> If you kill the Headless Ape first the wife will just leave
[2:34:39] <+TheSaintJohn> Does Woolie know that if he does the stabbing combat art he can pull the centipede out of the ape's empty neck hole when its knocked down?
[2:34:46] <dmtjinni> woolie sandwich yum
[2:34:47] <+linSP> remember the double fish giant encounter in the well in bloodborne
[2:34:47] <KumaTorey> Simian and OrnSapien
[2:34:48] <+AosTheory> cant escape from crossing fate
[2:34:49] <%RioGascar> evo19Download the new ape fight woolie
[2:34:51] <samuraijakanddaxter> can you make them fight each other? i cant remember, but that thing that makes beasts go nuts or something
[2:34:51] <%RioGascar> Do it
[2:34:52] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> You can either focus on the brown first which takes longer but makes the fight easier, or finish the fight with the headless but its risky
[2:34:52] <noobpsyboticus> he was almost a Jill sandwich
[2:34:54] <hassanico1> @TheSaintJohn no
[2:34:55] <+Dragoneye77> its eaiser just to kill the other first
[2:35:04] <+zanzibar_junker> Use fireworks on her
[2:35:04] <%supersugoisenpai1> The other one is way easier to kill first
[2:35:06] <Slim_Lipid> Double Rajang Flashbacks monkaS
[2:35:17] <hassanico1> yo Posture is almost broken
[2:35:19] <+gryffon95> yeah seems the consensus is to deal with brown
[2:35:26] <%Wool> Woolie is doing surprisingly really well
[2:35:26] <noobpsyboticus> spear would've done it probably...
[2:35:27] <+gryffon95> but hes doing....fine?
[2:35:38] <Hydrapissed> can firecracker the alive one or light it on fire
[2:35:39] <haisho> I actually haven't seen anyone do this without taking the wife out first
[2:35:41] <haisho> this is interesting
[2:35:43] <thirst_patrol> this just convinced me to never buy this game
[2:35:51] <shotgang86> what is this bullshit?
[2:35:52] <hassanico1> @thirst_patrol it's an optional boss
[2:35:58] <+Grayhammatter> don't become a sekiro sandiwch woolie
[2:36:02] <Graxe_> Woolie's actually doing really well with this dual boss
[2:36:03] <shadow1man9> Honestly this fight's easier than Ape Round 1
[2:36:04] <eldragon_1> This makes me miss Ornstein and Smough. Good times.
[2:36:05] <+Dragoneye77> It actually isnt if you go here too late @hassanico1
[2:36:08] <+linSP> look at them dance moves
[2:36:10] <$Rezca> out of all of the bosses, I think this is the worst of it
[2:36:14] <+Dragoneye77> It can be mandatory
[2:36:14] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:36:20] <%RioGascar> so did orensten and smough make you quit as well?
[2:36:23] <shadow1man9> He has the easier moveset and a lot less HP
[2:36:27] <$BappoSama> @WoolieVersus DEAL WITH THE WIFE FIRST
[2:36:27] <+zanzibar_junker> The fireworks stuns her good
[2:36:28] <%Tearonex> this boss is actually way easier than the first round
[2:36:29] <KumaTorey> a 2 v 1 in a fromsoft game? woah shocking Jebaited
[2:36:29] <candidateplays> Honestly, it's really not too bad if you just blitz down the Missus
[2:36:36] <+gryffon95> thats rough....all that posture damage gone
[2:36:40] <dmtjinni> damn
[2:36:48] <+Amaideus> Say it with me Chat
[2:36:51] <+Amaideus> Hesitation is Defeat
[2:36:52] <Tucker0603> kill wifey
[2:36:54] <shadow1man9> The wife also has very little HP and should be killed first
[2:36:54] <+FlubbedPig> Double Apes isn't a bad fight, it's just lame.
[2:36:55] <dmtjinni> more offence woolie
[2:36:56] <Hydrapissed> SLAMMED
[2:36:57] <noobpsyboticus> fireworks
[2:36:58] <+gryffon95> knifey the wifey
[2:37:00] <+linSP> final boss: camera
[2:37:01] <+Dragoneye77> woollies gone 🦀
[2:37:09] <Professor_Rakor> Yer not doing bad.
[2:37:12] <+DRAGKUDO> does he not have the mortal blade?
[2:37:13] <hassanico1> Chat teach Woolie about the Spear trick on Headless
[2:37:19] <eldragon_1> @riogascar who quit?
[2:37:19] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> yeah whenever headless is open, wifey attacks, thats why theyre strong
[2:37:21] <haisho> you were actually doing really good for treating it like a dual boss
[2:37:21] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Woolie the Confetti works wonders against the Guardian Ape
[2:37:24] <+gryffon95> he does, just only 9 emblems
[2:37:25] <+Dragoneye77> and woolie will now discover how weak the brown ape is
[2:37:27] <$Ralfclogs> Just attack who's closer
[2:37:28] <haisho> most people just beat down the wife
[2:37:30] <noobpsyboticus> she's a lot easier to kill
[2:37:35] <$BappoSama> @WoolieVersus He gives you way too many opportunities to wail on the wife before he actually goes in, so you should honestly just deal with her first.
[2:37:36] <$FuqBoiSlim> missus doesn't have a lot of health
[2:37:38] <%RioGascar> Someone who said this now makes me wanna not pick uo the game
[2:37:50] <%LiquidShake83> how about, whoever's in front of you swing at them.
[2:37:53] <+zanzibar_junker> Fireworks dude
[2:37:57] <haisho> you can come back to it later
[2:37:58] <noobpsyboticus> fireworks!
[2:37:58] <%RioGascar> Which...honestly sekiro i wouldn’t recommend to someone that isnt bug soul or fromsoft fan
[2:37:59] <eldragon_1> Ah
[2:37:59] <+gryffon95> @RioGascar said what?
[2:38:02] <+linSP> you get a good item though
[2:38:02] <vikbadwolf> You can come back
[2:38:06] <shotgang86> the "normal ape" is waaaay weaker
[2:38:07] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> yesss firecrackers
[2:38:09] <+gryffon95> ah
[2:38:09] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> It goes away if you had progressed
[2:38:10] <+TheSaintJohn> oh wait it wasn't a combat art it was the spear tool
[2:38:12] <shotgang86> just get rid of it
[2:38:18] <haisho> this fight always happens after killing the Guardian Ape at valley
[2:38:20] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> hahaaha
[2:38:22] <+Dragoneye77> beat it nerd
[2:38:24] <%commanderclaw> Can't escape from crossing apes!
[2:38:25] <noobpsyboticus> oof
[2:38:28] <+zanzibar_junker> It's not locked
[2:38:28] <Hydrapissed> it is two attack
[2:38:30] <+gryffon95> yeah i get ya, this game has no replay value and has problems
[2:38:30] <Hydrapissed> does help a lot
[2:38:30] <+FlubbedPig> No you don't
[2:38:35] <+gryffon95> also big F
[2:38:40] <noobpsyboticus> yea that's def not true
[2:38:40] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> While he still knows the patterns he should beat it
[2:38:41] <%fatal_penguin_> Kuwabara, Kuwabara
[2:38:43] <$BappoSama> @commanderclaw Bravo good sir, bravo.
[2:38:46] <haisho> so if you didn't do Depth before Valley he winds up being mandatory
[2:38:48] <%Tearonex> @WoolieVersus the waifu has like 50% health
[2:38:48] <+zanzibar_junker> Fireworks
[2:38:52] <chronoxgp> you're supposed to come at it from the other way because all of the merc's are beat up
[2:38:56] <eldragon_1> Woolie, you beat O&S while fat rolling. You got this.
[2:39:03] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Divine Confetti.
[2:39:06] <hassanico1> @WoolieVersus There is a trick with the Spear here. When you parry Headless until he falls over, you can use Spear on his neck to deal massive damage
[2:39:06] <vikbadwolf> Blah
[2:39:08] <+zanzibar_junker> Buy emblems
[2:39:09] <ScreamLord> @WoolieVersus If you do manage to kill the Male first the Female will just fuck off and leave
[2:39:12] <$Ralfclogs> @commanderclaw LUL
[2:39:13] <+FlubbedPig> @WoolieVersus Using spear pull on his neck-stump deals HUGE posture damage. It's a specific interaction.
[2:39:17] <+zanzibar_junker> Fireworks
[2:39:19] <noobpsyboticus> you did pretty good at first though
[2:39:30] <%RioGascar> i would say if ya do fromsoft probably do blood borne since its the most focused and polished of froms
[2:39:47] <+TheSaintJohn> that's the one
[2:39:48] <+Dragoneye77> what he didnt know about the spear
[2:39:49] <+gryffon95> @RioGascar though this game has its perks id agree
[2:39:52] <+FlubbedPig> Spear's Drag
[2:39:57] <%RioGascar> the ds games to me always seem to lack focus
[2:40:01] <hassanico1> @Dragoneye77 nopw
[2:40:02] <+gryffon95> they just need to pull all the pieces of the puzzle together
[2:40:02] <haisho> Spear Drag can pull the centipede out of the neck
[2:40:03] <$BappoSama> @WoolieVersus That one.
[2:40:08] <chronoxgp> yeah rolling is just a bad mechanic for new comers
[2:40:09] <+Amaideus> The spear is lowkey one of the best tools
[2:40:09] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> @Dragoneye77 This is the first time he's had spirit emblems while fighting the headless ape
[2:40:10] <haisho> it's SUPER HUGE posture damage
[2:40:14] <hassanico1> @WoolieVersus use the Spear after your parry combo specfiically
[2:40:18] <+function_2> @WoolieVersus the umbrella allows you to sit inside the scream
[2:40:24] <noobpsyboticus> @woolieversus you have to wait for the headless ape to be in the stunned state
[2:40:26] <$BappoSama> omg minh stfu
[2:40:35] <haisho> nope
[2:40:36] <+Dragoneye77> no

[2:43:31] <Hydrapissed> wrong lock on woolie
[2:43:31] <Tucker0603> meanwhile I'm here in Warframe farming with a flamethrower
[2:43:37] <vVAstrAVv> never shut up mihn
[2:43:47] <noobpsyboticus> spear is totally worth it. it's posture damage
[2:43:55] <$Rezca> oh my, it can keep going
[2:43:55] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Hold run button instead of jumping backwards to avoid successive attacks
[2:43:59] <Hydrapissed> well if u keep the pressure on its worth it lol
[2:44:03] <Hydrapissed> aka dont let him recover
[2:44:08] <Psyramics> if he doesnt mind tips tell him about the firecrackers. these things count as beasts
[2:44:10] <razdoop> @Tucker0603 Hey im grinding reps in for honor
[2:44:30] <+FlubbedPig> @Psyramics Only Wife Ape does. Headless is undead.
[2:44:31] <+gryffon95> am i the only one who thinks the game audio sounds off?
[2:44:33] <haisho> technically only the wife counts as a beast, Guardian doesn't get the full stun effect
[2:44:40] <Hydrapissed> yah
[2:44:40] <$Rezca> grinding embers, please do not tell anyone my dark secret
[2:44:45] <Hydrapissed> headless is undead wife = beast
[2:44:53] <%fatal_penguin_> @gryffon95 Sounds fine to me.

[2:45:25] <+gryffon95> ok guess its just me
[2:45:26] <Hydrapissed> yah fire or firecrackers is great on the wife to
[2:45:29] <Hydrapissed> can shut her down fast
[2:45:30] <+TopTieramisu> is woolie enjoying O&S?

[2:45:57] <%RioGascar> @toptieramisu orangutan and simian?
[2:45:59] <+gryffon95> oh no, like not desynced, it just sounds...off in the sense of like a weird almost crackling. but again. other than that its fine. just curious
[2:46:00] <haisho> just have to be careful of the other ape since they cover each other
[2:46:06] <+FlubbedPig> If memory serves, the radius of the screech is smaller directly behind his back.

[2:53:26] <worldbrand> mine's coherent
[2:53:28] <%Theplahunter> @WoolieVersus ok so it wouldn't be a cow bursting out, you'd just have the parasites of the raw meat in your body
[2:53:29] <samuraijakanddaxter> "original state" is too vague, would it be a baby cow, or the cow from just before it was killed?
[2:53:30] <%king_wragles> @WoolieVersus my name is Wragles btw, not Raygills
[2:53:30] <haisho> @WoolieVersus The pasta would have turned into wheat instead of uncooked pasta going by that logic
[2:53:31] <+RayDaug> Just call him Ishmael
[2:53:32] <thirst_patrol> its a literary reference
[2:53:32] <$BappoSama> @drefizz I guess that makes sense, I'm still new to the whole JoJo lore so forgive my insolence.

[2:54:49] <+FlubbedPig> @WoolieVersus Could Crazy Diamond un-photosynthesize sunlight from a plant, turning leaves into vampire-melting flashbangs?
[2:54:50] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> BLOOD SORD
[2:54:52] <%QueequegTheater> Woolie VS preschool level English speech
[2:54:55] <haisho> oh wait wrong move
[2:54:58] <haisho> just super sword
[2:54:58] <FackinCrazy> I dont think i ever used this in combat
[2:55:02] <candidateplays> It does massive damage
[2:55:02] <redrins> the damage goes through normal enemies blocks
[2:55:11] <haisho> eats spirit emblems though
[2:55:12] <hassanico1> Range extender
[2:55:16] <RupanSen> Puppeteer is OP Woolz
[2:55:17] <ScreamLord> @WoolieVersus Basically it gives your sword huge range and damage
[2:55:17] <chronoxgp> you can just charge it no back stab needed
[2:55:21] <Professor_Rakor> It can turn into poison if you use it on a lizard.
[2:55:26] <redrins> you can stunlock the spear minibosses with it
[2:55:28] <haisho> I never really used it
[2:55:30] <noobpsyboticus> tools are way too expensive, God damn
[2:55:48] <+linSP> but wait, he's not done here is he
[2:55:48] <shadow1man9> @WoolieVersus If you use Bestowal on the poison lizards your sword gets a poison effect
[2:55:52] <haisho> because she's a beast
[2:55:55] <$Ralfclogs> @queequegtheater are you being mean to Woofliy
[2:55:57] <%QueequegTheater> None of the ninjutsu are particularly useless IMO since none of them can be used in boss fights
[2:56:01] <hassanico1> @linSP no, there's a Shichimen with the Ring upgrade here
[2:56:04] <rosemon5001> can our little man lounge harder 1 step away from a lewd photoshoot
[2:56:05] <%QueequegTheater> *useful
[2:56:05] <haisho> it does some mild stagger
[2:56:06] <$BappoSama> @WoolieVersus Minh, how big of a Naruto fan are you? Just curious.
[2:56:11] <haisho> but doesn't do the full Beast effect
[2:56:19] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> yo Juzo
[2:56:26] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> used to be a sumo
[2:56:35] <%QueequegTheater> I've come to make an announcement
[2:56:55] <heartbabe29> you can use the bestowal ninjutsu against certain bosses if you find an enemy just before the boss fog
[2:56:55] <+linSP> woolie zone out and come back to that bonfire
[2:57:01] <hassanico1> This game is full of lore
[2:57:18] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> the 9th necklace is sad lore
[2:57:23] <Hydrapissed> naruto

[2:58:15] <%KoyFoster> That's rude AF. It's good looking and has it's own style.
[2:58:17] <Hydrapissed> oh attack oni titant
[2:58:27] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Nah it looks the same as it did back then, still awful
[2:58:28] <alexandrecau> IT'S part of the rascism
[2:58:32] <$FuqBoiSlim> I think its attack on aotans
[2:58:33] <$Rezca> beats being a secondary
[2:58:37] <alexandrecau> everyone look alike
[2:58:48] <NiktenKing> AoT art is crap
[2:58:52] <ScreamLord> @WoolieVersus Which Manga dude? I missed the name
[2:58:54] <Uyko112> This game is great! Too bad I just beat it once lmao.
[2:59:02] <haisho> he got a second wife
[2:59:03] <Hydrapissed> another one showed up lol
[2:59:03] <ISkyHunterI> AoT was crap at first but he improved vastly
[2:59:03] <$FuqBoiSlim> Matches the story Kappa
[2:59:04] <$Rezca> Ape had to remarry
[2:59:05] <%Solidnick18> lol

[2:59:14] <+whiskey_wolfe_> the wife is literally above you right now
[2:59:15] <hassanico1> He remarried
[2:59:16] <$ofloofy> 2 different ape wifes
[2:59:16] <%Theplahunter> @WoolieVersus you can't just ask why someones partner didn't come, woolie.
[2:59:22] <alexandrecau> As if death will stop you
[2:59:24] <+Caped_Eggy> There should be an ape skeleton
[2:59:25] <+Tadashi047> Shingeki's art improved so much from the beginning
[2:59:27] <$BappoSama> omg
[2:59:27] <ScreamLord> Maybe
[2:59:30] <spinalwizard> all day every day
[2:59:30] <$BappoSama> That's the best one.
[2:59:32] <+whiskey_wolfe_> The first wife's corpse is above you.
[2:59:35] <Hydrapissed> the other big ape is on top I belive btw
[2:59:35] <+ArcanumMBD> It was a messy divorce. I can't believe Woolie is so insensitive
[2:59:37] <Hydrapissed> the bones
[2:59:37] <Professor_Rakor> Technically a zombie ape killer.
[2:59:38] <heartbabe29> its a different wife, you can find the body of the first one
[2:59:39] <+FlubbedPig> Time to get FUCKED BY PURPLE BOYS
[2:59:41] <Hydrapissed> so this is a 2nd one
[2:59:41] <$FuqBoiSlim> The ape was mormon???
[2:59:42] <$BappoSama> G H O S T A P E K I L L A H
[2:59:43] <+0oki> That was a new mate, but you killed her @woolieversus
[2:59:50] <Hydrapissed> yah body is up top
[2:59:51] <%galaxyswirl> the wife's corpse is where she jumped down from
[2:59:53] <hassanico1> Chat when does Shichimen Warrior spawn in that room?
[2:59:53] <haisho> by the way Ghost Monkeys are an actual thing
[2:59:55] <+linSP> didnt get the ring tho, it was right there
[2:59:55] <+skylerpilot> @WoolieVersus you can get up to the area the mate jumps down from, before the fight / roar of the headless ape its just a pile of monkey bones
[2:59:56] <candidateplays> No, it's that wife,, she drops down from where you find her corpse.
[2:59:59] <Hydrapissed> just a 2nd wife
[3:00:08] <hassanico1> @linSP it's not there, it spawns after you beat Shichimen
[3:00:12] <gustavozxd> getting edgy
[3:00:22] <+linSP> @hassanico1 he spawns after the monkey?
[3:00:23] <spinalwizard> you cannot kill a zombie. It is more like cutting the grass
[3:00:25] <heartbabe29> not really it took a long time actually
[3:00:26] <Hydrapissed> I mean the damn flower he has attacts girls btw prob some rando girl showed up and was like hey we fighting?
[3:00:26] <Professor_Rakor> Buns for days.
[3:00:28] <Uyko112> Wait till he fight the Demon of Hatred lol.
[3:00:29] <%galaxyswirl> im pretty sure it aint a second wife
[3:00:34] <VJdarkworld> Being immortal aint easy BibleThump
[3:00:38] <hassanico1> @linSP I was asking, I'm not sure, but I know he has it
[3:00:46] <%fatal_penguin_> Minh, are you a booty or boob kinda guy?
[3:00:56] <+zanzibar_junker> Sell stuff buy farm emblems
[3:00:59] <ISkyHunterI> That dragon mask is the biggest waste of money i spent in the game FeelsBadMan
[3:01:06] <hassanico1> "Whose footprints are these?"
[3:01:06] <+ArcanumMBD> sure hope nothing bad happened to this guy's shift replacement
[3:01:10] <$BappoSama> @WoolieVersus Minh, how big of a Naruto fan are you? Just curious.

[3:01:53] <+nekodelic> neither boobs nor asses, soul
[3:01:56] <eldragon_1> Thighs or abs are the true answers
[3:02:03] <hassanico1> @WoolieVersus remember, lock on with the Finger Whistle makes the animal focus on that target
[3:02:07] <+0oki> I’ve always been a boob guy but 2b is making me change my mind

[3:06:01] <+Amaideus> Did Pat stream all of Sekiro?
[3:06:02] <Hydrapissed> Nicely done woolie
[3:06:03] <+Amaideus> I don't remember
[3:06:10] <Ion_Laser> @Amaideus yeah he did
[3:06:11] <%Lion_kun> yes
[3:06:15] <+FlubbedPig> Yeah Pat streamed it all
[3:06:17] <NeroInfinite> Pat streamed and finished sekiro
[3:06:17] <NiktenKing> Minh beat the game without upgrades, you dont get to say shit.
[3:06:19] <Professor_Rakor> Sing the fun up.
[3:06:19] <%fatal_penguin_> @Amaideus Yeah Pat beat it pretty quick
[3:06:20] <$BappoSama> Oh man, I can't wait for Woolie to get to the shit poppin off part of the game.
[3:06:21] <tri3dgE027> He did, finished all three endings @Amaideus
[3:06:25] <%Solidnick18> bunch of chumps
[3:06:30] <+Amaideus> I wonder why I don't remember any of it then
[3:06:30] <alexandrecau> then drown them
[3:06:31] <Hydrapissed> did pat do all endings no way
[3:06:33] <haisho> well then Woolie
[3:06:37] <+Amaideus> Guess I'll binge it later
[3:06:38] <+gryffon95> in the boat?
[3:06:40] <haisho> time to prove you've gotten good
[3:06:41] <+Amaideus> Ty chat
[3:06:51] <tri3dgE027> He basically save-scummed the two endings, then doing the other normally
[3:06:52] <hassanico1> Enemy of My Enemy Woolie
[3:06:59] <Hydrapissed> ah k
[3:07:05] <alexandrecau> pat did all the endings thanks to save scumming
[3:07:08] <hassanico1> @WoolieVersus remember you can dive
[3:07:35] <%fatal_penguin_> Is this game worth getting? I still haven't decided.
[3:07:38] <haisho> Are you prepared?!
[3:07:51] <hassanico1> New enemies
[3:07:53] <$BappoSama> Prepare the Fs chat
[3:07:59] <hassanico1> LONE SHADOW
[3:08:00] <+Amaideus> It's a good game but I hated about 80% of my playthrough
[3:08:03] <+gryffon95> @fatal_penguin_ unless your a souls fan not really
[3:08:03] <tri3dgE027> It's a fun game, not as replayable as Dark Souls or Bloodborne, but the gameplay is very addicting @fatal_penguin_
[3:08:06] <+FlubbedPig> yeah so these guys are just normal enemies now
[3:08:07] <+0oki> Say hello to your new regular enemy!
[3:08:11] <Graxe_> Now they're just a normal enemy
[3:08:19] <hassanico1> Lone Shadows are the fucking worst
[3:08:27] <%Solidnick18> lol
[3:08:31] <$Rezca> ring out
[3:08:33] <noobpsyboticus> well yea but previous fromsoft games actually bothered to justify it
[3:08:40] <NeroInfinite> clang
[3:08:45] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Look at this sick anime shit
[3:08:45] <alexandrecau> so he is the capra demon
[3:08:47] <%fatal_penguin_> Aw. Yeah I;m not much of a Souls fan. Wish I was. Never could get into it.
[3:08:55] <+Amaideus> Lone Shadows remind me of a mix of Onikage and that third ninja from Tekken
[3:08:59] <hassanico1> Guys, this Kick combo ends on a Thrust right?
[3:08:59] <+Amaideus> The older male one
[3:09:02] <+FlubbedPig> Dodge into thrusts, jump off sweeps
[3:09:02] <haisho> yeah this is pretty much Capra Demon
[3:09:20] <+Amaideus> Not Tekken, Tenchu
[3:09:22] <+Amaideus> Brain please
[3:09:31] <%Solidnick18> remember to jump on heads
[3:09:31] <+linSP> did woolie sigh
[3:09:41] <tri3dgE027> Lone Shadows are pretty weak against the Shield-Prosthetic tool, it destroys their Posture
[3:09:44] <StonerStan101> @WoolieVersus Come one show him, your Ninja ways! No one should take down the man that took down Reboot.
[3:09:45] <Professor_Rakor> Drop your jump, pat.
[3:09:47] <alexandrecau> Minh stop annoying
[3:09:50] <%SilvaChariot0133> can't remember, can you mikiri a foot?
[3:09:57] <ISkyHunterI> yes
[3:09:58] <%Solidnick18> yeah
[3:10:00] <haisho> it's a thrusting foot
[3:10:01] <+Amaideus> You can mikiri every thrst
[3:10:11] <haisho> technically you should break his legs with it but eh
[3:10:13] <haisho> VIDEOGAMES
[3:10:15] <alexandrecau> does that break his leg
[3:10:16] <+Amaideus> Supposedly you can mikiri ANY thrust even if it doesn't have the marker
[3:10:16] <tri3dgE027> Yup, you can Mikiri the kick-lunge
[3:10:17] <hassanico1> Forgetting about Mikiri right now is not the worst timing...
[3:10:22] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Shigi from Tenchu Z was pretty cool
[3:10:29] <%fatal_penguin_> Remember to heat the key, Woolie.
[3:10:34] <noobpsyboticus> just Dodge INTO the attack
[3:10:36] <+gryffon95> basically you commit to countering it
[3:10:36] <+FlubbedPig> @WoolieVersus Dodge into thrusts for Mikiri. Jump off sweeping enemies for big stagger
[3:10:43] <RupanSen> neutral circle or forward circle
[3:10:43] <haisho> gotta be forward
[3:10:43] <%Lion_kun> it's forward circle
[3:10:43] <Hydrapissed> dodge into the attack
[3:10:51] <VJdarkworld> Mikiri counter and goomba stomp very importante
[3:10:53] <+linSP> if you dodge left or right you dont mikiri, you dodge
[3:10:53] <$BappoSama> @WoolieVersus Forward Circle is the best way to do it.
[3:10:56] <haisho> cannot Mikiri to the back or sides
[3:11:08] <+gryffon95> just be a coward like pat
[3:11:19] <%QueequegTheater> Mikiri is only neutral dodge
[3:11:22] <vikbadwolf> Dodge into the attack, you can´t do it from the sides, i believe
[3:11:24] <%SilvaChariot0133> RIP
[3:11:31] <%fatal_penguin_> Everybody hating on Praying Boi
[3:11:32] <razdoop> Poor man

[3:11:46] <%Solidnick18> woo
[3:11:51] <noobpsyboticus> @woolieversus you can always go back to the tutorial guy if you need a refresher
[3:12:06] <+FlubbedPig> @WoolieVersus A long-term habit you've never broken is that you need to jump TOWARD sweeps so you can kick them in the head for big stagger damage.
[3:12:07] <+0oki> Central has come and so have I
[3:12:09] <haisho> man seeing Central has come makes me think of FMA more than Sekiro
[3:12:11] <%fatal_penguin_> Woolie, literally, try to remember some of the basics of CQC
[3:12:13] <$FuqBoiSlim> Swimkiro
[3:12:15] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @noobpsyboticus he killed him already

[3:13:07] <Hydrapissed> woolie LEARN this fight heads up
[3:13:07] <simulationbard> Lol Mihn said dooty Kappa
[3:13:18] <Professor_Rakor> Don't forget, blocking and standing still gives faster posture recovery.
[3:13:29] <+linSP> when a kick hits harder than a sword
[3:13:29] <Tersalus> this stream is the first gameplay I'vs ever seen of Sekiro...this is incredible
[3:13:35] <Tersalus> those KICKS !
[3:13:51] <haisho> time to remember a how-many-months old fight?
[3:13:57] <%fatal_penguin_> Com'on Woolie, you gonna let some guy beat you that's wearing your colors?
[3:14:11] <ergheisu> apparently not
[3:14:16] <chronoxgp> the games easier when you take that much time off to heal
[3:14:20] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Isn't Woolie a green guy more so than purple?
[3:14:28] <tri3dgE027> Hit and don't get hit 4Head
[3:14:28] <ergheisu> you need both
[3:14:34] <ergheisu> you need the whole package or it just aint right

[3:20:24] <CSeriesJTYPE> netherlands 3
[3:20:24] <razdoop> Thats fine
[3:20:26] <$Walopoh> Not like BL3 even really plays BL3 with how bad it's performance is
[3:20:33] <rainwater739> Having mannerisms like Wollie seems like the opposite of a problem...
[3:20:36] <Prevot> NotLikeThis
[3:20:36] <Professor_Rakor> Girls are always watching, they know things.

[3:20:59] <Prevot> aren't ALL stand power vague bullshit?
[3:21:00] <TCCBros> its fukin jojo its seat of pants writing
[3:21:01] <Hydrapissed> he could just punch the ground and revert the planet to nothing
[3:21:03] <%drefizz> Could Josuke have reverted Dio back to a human?
[3:21:05] <Koosahmii> 🙎♀️🙋♀️
[3:21:08] <GobblesInTheMist> Yes girls are watching
[3:21:11] <+d00msdaydan> basically dependent on how araki wants to move the pot forward
[3:21:12] <rainwater739> Girl here too!
[3:21:12] <+ItsRatman> Josuke could revert the earth into its constituent parts, he's just never tried it.
[3:21:13] <+gryffon95> bleh....still...
[3:21:18] <simulationbard> It all depends on how far is Akira willing to take his bullshit
[3:21:22] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> theres probably a time limit to what he can revert
[3:21:24] <Hydrapissed> he can do it \
[3:21:25] <+Evil_John_Cena> Hi Woolie
[3:21:28] <chronoxgp> josuke could make steven hawk stand up again
[3:21:28] <%drefizz> Could josuke have reverted Kars back to a mortal?
[3:21:33] <+theAncopro> josuke was able to reverse an exploded person dust so i feel like its celular
[3:21:34] <Professor_Rakor> Josuke just needs a big enough fist.
[3:21:40] <%fatal_penguin_> Stands are Harry Potter, basically

[3:24:06] <StonerStan101> Absorbing Man is like the hand from JOJO easily can be the most broken thing in verse, but the user is an idiot.
[3:24:12] <%wolfofsound> remember when ice man
[3:24:24] <+gryffon95> god i love the hand
[3:24:25] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @WoolieVersus the thing is some of the Jojo powers that Araki does makes it so he can loosely stretch out the extent of the power. Like how Josuke "fixes" and Giorno "creates life".

[3:25:05] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> thats pretty much how you evolve a power
[3:25:08] <+0oki> And he can make ice constructs
[3:25:13] <runicslime> When the Hand erases the space from killer queen stomach, he grab stray cat, but its weird how a physical manifestation was removed with how killer queen phase in and out.

[3:33:55] <Prevot> that's the problem with Netflix licensed anime
[3:33:56] <+chaos5338> what did i come back to?
[3:34:00] <$BappoSama> Look at Apex Legends.
[3:34:02] <Shwepie> Netflix is super ashamed of the binge culture they've created. They try to avoid talking about it but still encourage it.
[3:34:13] <$BappoSama> Even though it dropped super hard in popularity.
[3:34:15] <%fatal_penguin_> Ok Chat, Waffles or Pancakes?
[3:34:16] <+chaos5338> why does Woolie look like a mutant football player?
[3:34:21] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Didn't he talk about that on the podcast?
[3:34:24] <%Lion_kun> Waffles
[3:34:36] <+cvp5127> aargh

[3:35:49] <ididitredy> have you guys played greedfall yet?
[3:35:51] <CSeriesJTYPE> I think they dont want people binging on something they were anticipating and then canceling their sub
[3:35:58] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> sbfpYeyeye
[3:36:01] <samuraijakanddaxter> disney are gonna do weekly
[3:36:16] <%wolfofsound> @ididitredy I saw dansgame play and it looked fun
[3:36:16] <%fatal_penguin_> @CSeriesJTYPE But we all canceled our HBO accounts when GoT finally ended. lol
[3:36:20] <+cvp5127> in conclusion just pirate
[3:36:20] <KeiPrime> just stick your snout in the trough of content, pigs
[3:36:45] <+Restartist> Yo I just got here, what is Woolie wearing?
[3:36:45] <ScreamLord> Holy shit he's in the robot again!
[3:37:06] <+Cthulos> @woolieversus rad kigurumi(???) dude!
[3:37:07] <+BurkeBigsby> Because they want you to stick around instead of finishing anything decent in the month, then cancelling.
[3:37:08] <+whitemage4life> I try to save spot in LP playlist and never stays
[3:37:17] <+ugmo1> The Patriot Act
[3:37:21] <samuraijakanddaxter> well the news would literally have to be made weekly
[3:37:22] <+Andrizzleton> Patriot Act
[3:37:27] <noobpsyboticus> binge has really negative connotations
[3:37:42] <+0oki> I’m one of those that will wait until a whole anime season is finished and then binge the whole thing. I love binging even if I have to force myself to wait
[3:37:43] <noobpsyboticus> that's probably why they don't say it
[3:37:44] <+Cthulos> spoil what?

[4:01:58] <NeroInfinite> Robots aren't furry tho
[4:02:04] <%Lion_kun> he's already gotten both hearts for the 4th ending
[4:02:05] <This_is_Marco> "this is fine"
[4:02:06] <ididitredy> robofurryism?
[4:02:14] <LodiFrostbeard> robots ARE furry
[4:02:24] <+Reizie_Etherealm> lol
[4:02:27] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Nero, you clearly haven't watched the latest Rebuild
[4:02:27] <+fingalights> Furries are the robots of today
[4:02:28] <%RioGascar> Fair, i may be misremembering and thinking these took way longer
[4:02:29] <randomness_yo> @WoolieVersus Where did you get that Totoro neon light lamp thing?
[4:02:32] <RazHarvey> its just a phase Kappa
[4:02:36] <+Reizie_Etherealm> "Don't question it" - Woolie Madden 2019
[4:02:36] <NeroInfinite> I willfight you if you say robots are furry.
[4:02:41] <haisho> what the hell
[4:02:42] <%mh9s> furbots
[4:02:47] <haisho> who said robots are furry
[4:02:48] <bear_breaker20> robots are furry funny enough
[4:02:48] <+Emperor_Bad> robots had feathers
[4:02:49] <VidulaSaix> Woolie is a mechakin Kappa
[4:02:49] <invisi_bliss> what in the world?
[4:02:52] <CrimsonGargoyle> fobots are rurry
[4:02:54] <bear_breaker20> if you knew the lore
[4:02:55] <+Pinkiefan> Are dogs robots?
[4:02:57] <%RioGascar> Furots
[4:02:59] <VaudevilleVillain93> But if it's your mom
[4:03:12] <tri3dgE027> Oh...so they are going to save-scum this path instead, LUL
[4:03:14] <DracaenaLeaf> you want to fuck androids then :^)
[4:03:16] <%RioGascar> Your jusr a weeb
[4:03:19] <noobpsyboticus> a mechromancer
[4:03:19] <+0oki> Guys he’s not a furry, he’s a mecky
[4:03:21] <%RioGascar> Not a furry
[4:03:23] <%RioGascar> Even worse
[4:03:28] <+Cthulos> EAT SHIT, CAPTAIN CARL :WoolieJudge:
[4:03:28] <%Lion_kun> okay chat, which branch do you wanna see first
[4:03:30] <+Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> He has a lot of Souls
[4:03:31] <brainbustaaaaa> he eats lots and lots of rice
[4:03:32] <zamzoph> He's big because you obviously fight him
[4:03:34] <%Lion_kun> I say bad ending first
[4:03:36] <haisho> uh oh
[4:03:37] <+Cthulos> vindication, motherfucker
[4:03:38] <+fingalights> Woolie next to Pat
[4:03:46] <This_is_Marco> this man ate his veggies
[4:03:49] <ididitredy> sekiro is 5 foot 1 inch
[4:03:52] <%RioGascar> I’ll be honest lion...I forget the paths entirely
[4:03:55] <%drefizz> @0oki whats a mecky
[4:03:57] <Professor_Rakor> You are VERY short. Did you see how many mini bosses you've fought that are his size.
[4:03:59] <zamzoph> Wolf is like the shortest man in Japan
[4:03:59] <haisho> oh we doing THIS first?
[4:03:59] <GrandMazterNelson> woolie obviously hasn't read the manga Kingdom
[4:04:02] <+linSP> BAD END TIME
[4:04:08] <bear_breaker20> :(
[4:04:08] <+Dman1500> Do they have a backup save?
[4:04:09] <zamzoph> IRON CODE
[4:04:11] <+Caped_Eggy> What was it again? Break the ironcode or you are an iron chode?
[4:04:11] <%Atomik456> wolf is link sized
[4:04:14] <socratetris> @riogascar the firsr playthrough takes forever, but you can just run through like a boss-butch thereafter
[4:04:14] <%Lion_kun> Obey the code
[4:04:25] <razdoop> But he is a awesome fight though...
[4:04:29] <+Sendaar> Oh god you're doing the bad end? Good fucking luck
[4:04:29] <simulationbard> Owl's huge but Wolf's pretty short too
[4:04:31] <%Lion_kun> this is gonna take a while, this boss is tough
[4:04:31] <dan_g_v> time to betray the kid
[4:04:33] <+zanzibar_junker> fight him
[4:04:36] <zamzoph> "pounce" Kreygasm
[4:04:36] <+0oki> @drefizz I just made that up, was just joking hehe
[4:04:46] <zamzoph> OBEY
[4:04:52] <%RioGascar> Isnt thar royalty in general
[4:04:57] <brainbustaaaaa> oh thats cool
[4:04:58] <socratetris> wolf is only like 5'0" tall
[4:05:00] <VidulaSaix> FeelsBadMan
[4:05:00] <%RioGascar> I cant be a dick to you publically
[4:05:02] <+0oki> Time to be a pat
[4:05:05] <razdoop> woolie the betrayer
[4:05:08] <+fingalights> OOOO, hope the save backup worked
[4:05:13] <%RioGascar> SO I SHALL plot your death in secret but bow in public
[4:05:17] <hassanico1> OH HE IS
[4:05:17] <zamzoph> Woolie really wants that jetpack
[4:05:21] <+linSP> apatBig BETRAY
[4:05:21] <%drefizz> HE SAID HADOU
[4:05:21] <%Lion_kun> that's the other branch woolie
[4:05:24] <VidulaSaix> VoHiYo
[4:05:28] <LodiFrostbeard> WIFU
[4:05:28] <+fingalights> SHE ATTAK
[4:05:30] <+PinkSuprende> I like that as game design
[4:05:30] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> WAIFU BATTLE
[4:05:37] <+PinkSuprende> But its stupid as hell that HE would say that to YOU
[4:05:40] <%drefizz> Our mom is our waifu?
[4:05:41] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Emma of THE GENTLE BLADE
[4:05:42] <socratetris> emma is a cooler boss fight than owl
[4:05:43] <Aydarkzero> she heal she protec but most importantly she attac
[4:05:55] <%jinking79> alright a dark ending for this LP
[4:05:55] <reiju_22> enbE
[4:05:58] <Divryne> Oh wow did Woolie just pick that bad ending?
[4:05:59] <+Amaideus> The first "Firekeeper" style NPC who's also a boss
[4:06:04] <+Amaideus> Emma's pretty hype
[4:06:06] <%drefizz> OH NO
[4:06:13] <+fingalights> Daddy, are we the baddies?
[4:06:22] <razdoop> Of course w
[4:06:24] <+linSP> big bad
[4:06:24] <Divryne> LUL
[4:06:25] <simulationbard> He's got a save state he's gonna go back to and do the real ending
[4:06:34] <%Atomik456> so uh prepare to get the harder fight
[4:06:44] <+fingalights> PERSPECTIVE?!
[4:06:44] <yukichocomilk> when you miss an entire zone it's a bad ending LUL
[4:06:44] <ididitredy> is emma the lady maria of this game?
[4:06:48] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> now eat this gentle blade
[4:06:49] <+zanzibar_junker> he stabbed you
[4:06:49] <%DeathsDoom> no there is no perspective here
[4:06:50] <+Reizie_Etherealm> WHOOOOO
[4:06:50] <eldragon_1> Traitor SwiftRage
[4:06:51] <%drefizz> Man...I love a woman who can kick my ass
[4:06:51] <Aydarkzero> Woolie about to cream his pants
[4:06:52] <StonerStan101> So Woolie is now Pain?
[4:06:56] <nobody12349> Owl is generating menacing kanji as we speak
[4:06:57] <LaughingCatt> I mean all things considered, this path is pretty damn firmly the Bad ending
[4:07:00] <CrimsonGargoyle> emma's theme reminds me a log of ohatsu's theme from dawn of dreams, and that makes me happy!
[4:07:00] <+Amaideus> She's basically the Maria of this game, yeah
[4:07:01] <%RioGascar> Is it bad all this is reminding me of is how cool ghost of tushimia is gonna be with the kurasawa influences???
[4:07:08] <vikbadwolf> Is woolie going to save scum like pat???
[4:07:10] <razdoop> Emma the Red Vergil
[4:07:12] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> JUDGEMENT CUT\
[4:07:34] <VidulaSaix> Dunked
[4:07:39] <%Lion_kun> this is gonna take a wgile
[4:07:42] <haisho> just a suit
[4:07:43] <SixthSun2> Just a suit
[4:07:47] <haisho> but don't get distracted!
[4:07:50] <+fingalights> Man, i love the sound design for this game, can tell what's happening just from the clanks

[4:08:25] <%RioGascar> Honestly i like this fight more than the other path fight
[4:08:29] <chronoxgp> maybe it's better this way...
[4:08:32] <hassanico1> I never got to hear her theme for so long
[4:08:33] <%RioGascar> but i also like its music more
[4:08:35] <hassanico1> Yo, Swallow Cut

[4:09:01] <%RioGascar> To infinity and beyond
[4:09:01] <Ion_Laser> :D
[4:09:04] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[4:09:06] <koolaid_kevster> LMAO
[4:09:06] <CrimsonGargoyle> to jesus, and beyond!
[4:09:07] <NiktenKing> LUL
[4:09:07] <mayorrev> FALLING WITH STYLE
[4:09:11] <+Reizie_Etherealm> LUL
[4:09:12] <chronoxgp> jus play the game it'll happen when it's supposed to happen
[4:09:17] <+linSP> BUZZ LOOK OUT
[4:09:26] <%king_wragles> Get in the robot, Woody.
[4:09:27] <SixthSun2> This isn't third impact, this is DYING WITH STYLE
[4:09:32] <psydaku> Your yomi needs refinement Woolie-san
[4:09:37] <%Lion_kun> woolie you should grind before your next session
[4:09:43] <CrimsonGargoyle> knew woody was a shura, buzz! watch out!
[4:09:44] <LodiFrostbeard> lul
[4:09:44] <Aydarkzero> Woolie taking the long way
[4:09:49] <razdoop> To be fair, we can't really see that onesie is Eva
[4:10:05] <%RioGascar> Someone hit the button to activate spanish woolie lightyear
[4:10:13] <%king_wragles> So this is one of the options for the last boss, right?
[4:10:16] <CrimsonGargoyle> LUL
[4:10:16] <razdoop> we know cuz you Said i guess
[4:10:21] <+Pinkiefan> Does Woolie know the sacrificial blade gives emblems?
[4:10:26] <spacecatstreams> woolie is a handsome baby
[4:10:30] <LodiFrostbeard> @king_wragles yup
[4:10:30] <chronoxgp> I wonder what whoolie what have chose if minh didn't tell him
[4:10:42] <NiktenKing> Any eva fan would know what it is tho
[4:10:51] <+linSP> any shiny attack will pierce even if blocked right
[4:10:57] <hassanico1> Oh, it's the Ashina Cross
[4:11:04] <hassanico1> I just noticed
[4:11:10] <%RioGascar> I havent watched eva once and only due to you guys never shutting about it do i know what that is
[4:11:12] <bear_breaker20> perfect parry doesnt do damage
[4:11:14] <%commanderclaw> Partial parries are different I think
[4:11:14] <+Andrizzleton> double parry
[4:11:20] <chronoxgp> you have to parry shineys
[4:11:22] <LodiFrostbeard> @hassanico1 a lot of her stuff is recycled
[4:11:28] <$cureneckbeard> 死
[4:11:36] <chronoxgp> or seathes
[4:11:59] <+fingalights> There is a better save
[4:12:00] <chronoxgp> err sheaths
[4:12:11] <%Lion_kun> crackers\
[4:12:21] <Professor_Rakor> There is a better idol, but you need to kill a miniboss.
[4:12:21] <$BappoSama> Mist Raven works super well..
[4:12:23] <yukichocomilk> they all suck LUL
[4:12:26] <hassanico1> Firecrackers work on all humans no?
[4:12:27] <xxHungryxx> Oh snap a Woolie stream! Imma bout to cream! jaboodyPops jaboodyGurt
[4:12:39] <majindusto> Is Woolie wearing an EVA unit 1 Kigarumi?
[4:12:45] <bear_breaker20> there are still 2 mini bosses running around but their movesets are similar
[4:12:45] <%RioGascar> Its weird that boss runs for fromsoft games arent just...hey the bonfire is right outside the boss room just keep going at it
[4:12:48] <+Dragoneye77> wtf why did woolie pick this
[4:12:50] <$BappoSama> @hassanico1 Only ones with masks or helmets
[4:13:07] <Divryne> LUL
[4:13:09] <LodiFrostbeard> parrying works against her...
[4:13:30] <LodiFrostbeard> @Dragoneye77 he's gonna do both
[4:13:32] <simulationbard> @Dragoneye77 He wanted to see it, he's got a save before this he's gonna go back to so he can do the good endings
[4:13:37] <zamzoph> has Woolie gotten grabbed yet?
[4:13:37] <hassanico1> @BappoSama looks like it was effective here
[4:13:39] <+jessedouglas> Wait did he beat the game and went back for a different ending?
[4:13:45] <hassanico1> @zamzoph yeah he got tossed
[4:13:49] <+SnackinOnChimps> what ending is he going for? who is this boss
[4:13:51] <$BappoSama> @hassanico1 I was utterly wrong. My mistake
[4:13:53] <hassanico1> @jessedouglas no this is his first time here
[4:13:54] <simulationbard> No he just make a save state
[4:13:56] <razdoop> oof thats TUFF
[4:13:59] <LodiFrostbeard> @jessedouglas he's doing shura first
[4:14:11] <+jessedouglas> @hassanico1 ok thanks just came back :)
[4:14:17] <%Lion_kun> god this is just emma
[4:14:24] <+SnackinOnChimps> is woolie dressed as an EVA?
[4:14:27] <%Lion_kun> the rust is real
[4:14:31] <hassanico1> I don't think we're seeing other route boss tonight guys
[4:14:35] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @SnackinOnChimps
[4:14:48] <+Reizie_Etherealm> @SnackinOnChimps Yes
[4:14:55] <xxHungryxx> Get in the robot Woolie
[4:15:02] <+SnackinOnChimps> is woolie dressed as the dead body of his mom?
[4:15:08] <purple_bagel> Ive never seen this boss before, emmas so sick
[4:15:13] <+Pinkiefan> Emma is one of the easiest bosses in the game. Gonna take some time for him to get his skills back.
[4:15:26] <$NoWayRyanTatum> oh shit we went this route??
[4:15:26] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:15:29] <$BappoSama> @SnackinOnChimps dude, wtf?
[4:15:39] <Solokaldaka> is the an eva-01 outfit?
[4:15:40] <hassanico1> Hmmm... that combo looked like Orin's
[4:15:43] <Blank9> evangelion, bappa
[4:15:51] <oiseaublanc> I mean, it's not an easy game to play.
[4:15:56] <%jinking79> well Woolie will get a taste of the final boss with this ending
[4:15:59] <+rjshnozz> @NoWayRyanTatum they copied save to do both routes
[4:16:04] <VidulaSaix> Taking a break from it will make you hella rusty as well
[4:16:09] <+SnackinOnChimps> @BappoSama is some shinji eva stuff
[4:16:21] <$Walopoh> this isn't a very gentle blade
[4:16:29] <SixthSun2> Emma is a legit boss
[4:16:31] <LodiFrostbeard> man i want to replay this game now
[4:16:34] <xxHungryxx> That command grab chat
[4:16:35] <$BappoSama> @SnackinOnChimps Out of context, that was a little fucked up. :/
[4:16:45] <%Atomik456> emma, the mysterious random white lady samurai doctor, such a cool idea
[4:16:57] <shadow1man9> Ema is very much a posture fight
[4:17:01] <LodiFrostbeard> ichimonji when she wiffs
[4:17:21] <zamzoph> She must be at least half Japanese. Can't be _too_ foreign...
[4:17:21] <b1gboss007> no, parry everything
[4:17:23] <+SnackinOnChimps> @BappoSama my og comment was about him being an eva. The second comment was about his eva being his mom
[4:17:23] <bear_breaker20> how do you turn off the auto save? im at the exact same art as them
[4:17:26] <%jinking79> Woolie jumping like a scrub Darli player
[4:17:29] <bear_breaker20> part*
[4:17:38] <purple_bagel> Emma and the other route boss are very good at teaching you hat sometimes dodging is better than deflecting
[4:17:48] <shadow1man9> She moves fast and is aggressive but her posture and HP are very low so it's a pretty quick fight once you know what to do
[4:17:52] <+linSP> there is another bonfire besides this one thats closer to the roof
[4:17:52] <+fingalights> there is a better idol, near dojo
[4:17:56] <tri3dgE027> !MOTIVATION
[4:17:58] <Professor_Rakor> You can fight a miniboss for a better idol.
[4:18:03] <+fingalights> That works too
[4:18:12] <Professor_Rakor> but that works too
[4:18:16] <haisho> I just progress through the interior to unlock the dojo idol
[4:18:20] <haisho> but the damn ninjas
[4:18:20] <bear_breaker20> there are 2 more mini bosses infact*
[4:18:27] <hassanico1> The better Idol has a Lone Shadow before it no?
[4:18:38] <+fingalights> Ohh, I forgot...
[4:18:40] <haisho> better idol is guarded by a miniboss yes
[4:18:58] <hassanico1> The one where you practically have to use Puppetry to beat him...
[4:19:07] <bear_breaker20> the other ninja is by the serpent shrine
[4:19:11] <xxHungryxx> So is her fight before or after the Moonlight Butterfly chat? jaboodyWonka
[4:19:14] <Aydarkzero> big damage
[4:19:28] <+0oki> The bad thing about the other idol is that you have to beat a mini boss to get it AND you’ll have to beat that mini boss again when you reload your save @woolieversus
[4:19:38] <oiseaublanc> this game would be 1000% times better if it was entirely human vs human duels
[4:19:46] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Agreed
[4:19:52] <bear_breaker20> but great ape
[4:19:53] <hassanico1> ...
[4:19:54] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Well, only partly
[4:20:05] <%king_wragles> oh that was BULLSHIT
[4:20:07] <%king_wragles> he got away
[4:20:09] <tri3dgE027> Maximum Disrespect. Sipping my gourd LUL
[4:20:50] <shadow1man9> Yeah stop trying to parry the cross, just dodge around it
[4:20:52] <hassanico1> This track is very DS3ish
[4:20:53] <+SnackinOnChimps> he doesn't jump on her head for sweep punish
[4:20:56] <%RioGascar> well monkeys are still in the simian group same as humans
[4:21:09] <%drefizz> drefizz gifted a Tier 1 sub to bayotitties! This is their first Gift Sub in the channel! 
[4:21:17] <haisho> well
[4:21:18] <%RioGascar> So yeah it would be fine with 100% human vs human
[4:21:21] <RazHarvey> i thought he said "parry her boobs" LUL
[4:21:27] <+Pinkiefan> You can sort of cheese her by just hitting and running left around her.
[4:21:27] <oiseaublanc> @riogascar giant apes with removable heads aren't humans
[4:21:32] <haisho> it's been nice but the FFXIV Live Letter is happening soon and that means some YOKO TARO
[4:21:36] <LodiFrostbeard> PUNISH THE SWEEP
[4:21:36] <%RioGascar> still simian
[4:21:38] <+0oki> Nah monkey fight is too good imo
[4:21:38] <%king_wragles> @RazHarvey that's not bad advice tho
[4:21:39] <haisho> peace
[4:21:40] <+Mrmugz> I mean I would parry her boobs
[4:21:50] <$Walopoh> @RazHarvey parry her pam pams
[4:21:56] <chronoxgp> so she's using her sheathe to fight? nice
[4:21:57] <aeonicvector> @oiseaublanc debatable, but the one from earlier def isnt sapient enough to be considered human
[4:21:58] <oiseaublanc> @0oki I mean, it isn't
[4:22:00] <tri3dgE027> DETH
[4:22:25] <oiseaublanc> @aeonicvector its only debatable if you dont know what words mean
[4:22:27] <hassanico1> Not trying to be rude but I'm kinda confused at his struggles here, he's fought harder bosses
[4:22:27] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:22:38] <haisho> Emma has weird swing tmings
[4:22:39] <%RioGascar> Am i the only that hates attacks that you cant avoid damage on
[4:22:41] <xxHungryxx> Command grab
[4:22:41] <$BappoSama> @WoolieVersus For most sweeps you can jump over and then jump on them for a brief stun.
[4:22:52] <%RioGascar> like let me take 0 damage if i perfect parry it
[4:22:56] <tri3dgE027> Not really, it's pretty similar to the Shimasen Player @haisho
[4:23:02] <%jinking79> almost almost
[4:23:05] <VidulaSaix> FeelsBadMan
[4:23:15] <TheyCallMeVawn> BAD END

[4:25:02] <%RioGascar> Alrifhr woolie no estus beat him
[4:25:03] <%Sh00s> SF3 Oro
[4:25:06] <tri3dgE027> This Isshin Fight is arguably the harder version
[4:25:07] <%Atomik456> like the thing is, this guy as a young man was so badass he drove the shogunate from the north singlehandedly
[4:25:17] <Aydarkzero> poke
[4:25:28] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> SLash
[4:25:33] <hassanico1> Welp, here comes the problem

[4:25:51] <%RioGascar> I get the fire for mood...but does it have to be there...it makes me think you’ll set your self on fire
[4:25:52] <%Lion_kun> this is gonna be a while
[4:25:53] <TheRockingM> this guy is harder than Isshin, sword saint
[4:25:55] <$BappoSama> It says it right on the screen..
[4:25:55] <haisho> oh you didn't get the eavesdrop did you
[4:25:56] <razdoop> Isshin Ashina
[4:25:57] <TheyCallMeVawn> SWORD SAINT ISHIN
[4:25:59] <xxHungryxx> His sword is sharp
[4:25:59] <CrimsonGargoyle> tengu is his like, job isn't it LUL
[4:26:00] <Professor_Rakor> This was the last ending I did, gave it...different context.
[4:26:00] <+Pinkiefan> And the first part is the easy part.
[4:26:01] <GundamF91> His names literally on the screen
[4:26:04] <zamzoph> @WoolieVersus you pretty much gotta learn Emma enough to kill her with only one Heal. You'll need the rest
[4:26:12] <+Sendaar> This is the part where woolie realizes just how hard this is gonna be
[4:26:18] <+0oki> Never forget his name Isshin mutherfucking Ashina!!!
[4:26:19] <%RioGascar> Oh hey so hes the guy who wont come to the west
[4:26:25] <%RioGascar> cause its too japanese
[4:26:30] <haisho> time to kill Emma AGAIN
[4:26:30] <%RioGascar> Wait no sega said maybe
[4:26:31] <hassanico1> He has to beat Emma every time he wants to get to Ishin... welp chat...
[4:26:31] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Emma pretty much functions the same as Genichiro where you just need to keep the attack on them
[4:26:44] <CrimsonGargoyle> @WoolieVersus so just change the controls, it allows it, ez fix
[4:26:44] <hassanico1> We're gonna be spending the night here
[4:27:04] <bear_breaker20> are they on pc?
[4:27:09] <tri3dgE027> PS4
[4:27:10] <%RioGascar> Time to get a tent out and get to camping
[4:27:11] <razdoop> "Lord" Vergil
[4:27:14] <haisho> work for your ending Woolie
[4:27:16] <+0oki> The good news is tha Emma is good practice for isshin
[4:27:16] <%RioGascar> We gonna be here all night
[4:27:19] <+Reizie_Etherealm> I'll set up the campfire, can someone get marshmellows
[4:27:23] <CrimsonGargoyle> dance woolie dance!
[4:27:27] <tri3dgE027> ~DETH~
[4:27:35] <%RioGascar> I got tent
[4:27:37] <hassanico1> @razdoop think he was trying to say Genichiro and forgot the name
[4:27:39] <Aydarkzero> bonk
[4:27:39] <bear_breaker20> how did they turn of the autosave for save scumming then?
[4:27:39] <+CarlosEoM> "predictabo"
[4:27:40] <xxHungryxx> Chat if you were a boss fight how would it start?
[4:27:49] <%RioGascar> rolling start
[4:27:50] <haisho> playstation settings?
[4:28:00] <%RioGascar> as i an talking i go right into the fight
[4:28:00] <hassanico1> @bear_breaker20 they uploaded a save before picking the ending then turned off autosync
[4:28:02] <haisho> I actually appreciate that you can turn off cloud saves nowadays
[4:28:08] <haisho> forced cloud saves are garbage
[4:28:15] <tri3dgE027> Like Sans, start with your Strongest Move. Who cares about Boss Troupes
[4:28:17] <Aydarkzero> the auto save is still going to carry out they just have the save before he spoke to the Owl
[4:28:20] <%RioGascar> from cutsces straight into the fight
[4:28:27] <%RioGascar> no rest
[4:28:27] <purple_bagel> @xxhungryxx you mean if chat itself was a boss?
[4:28:42] <Run44forrest> he still hasnt beaten sekiro?
[4:28:46] <TigerClaws12> he's doing the shura ending? I thought they were going for return
[4:28:49] <hassanico1> Need to learn those sweeps and Mikiris
[4:28:49] <bear_breaker20> aaaaaahhhhhhhh... im on xtrash so im gonna have to look for that... @hassanico1
[4:28:55] <+CarlosEoM> panic
[4:28:55] <LodiFrostbeard> @Run44forrest evidently
[4:29:04] <bear_breaker20> im at the exact same part as them lol
[4:29:06] <%Lion_kun> woolie stop using thrust attacks, they're too slow
[4:29:13] <xBiggestD> mikiri counter that!
[4:29:23] <xxHungryxx> @purple_bagel well, i mean who ever wants to answer
[4:29:30] <Aydarkzero> 3 heals left bois and girls

[4:31:16] <+whitemage4life> So when will he do sick ninja mage shit. As we all know from Naruto is that ninjas are wizards
[4:31:18] <tri3dgE027> ^ this is the first
[4:31:19] <purple_bagel> No
[4:31:36] <LodiFrostbeard> @purple_bagel but after you learn them you can fight them 100 times in a row and never lose
[4:31:40] <+goose_attack_almanac> roof dogs

[4:33:25] <MrEli111> @WoolieVersus This is where I'm stuck as well.
[4:33:34] <ScreamLord> This makes me wish for a new Ninja Gaiden

[4:36:30] <%Lion_kun> woolie stop thrusting
[4:36:30] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[4:36:37] <chronoxgp> woolie too greedy just take one hit and back off
[4:36:38] <$cureneckbeard> 死
[4:36:41] <NiktenKing> Mada, mada, koinu yo!
[4:36:41] <%RioGascar> I would say woolie if you get to this fight with lowee than 5 estus dont respawn in death
[4:36:49] <zamzoph> he still hasn't hit Isshin yet LUL
[4:36:50] <Monkeyweed21> @LodiFrostbeard thats really lame
[4:36:51] <razdoop> Damn Old Isshin is so cool
[4:37:06] <%Vegaburd> oh shit im digging the fit woolz
[4:37:07] <%Lion_kun> nah you have to get in
[4:37:09] <LodiFrostbeard> @Monkeyweed21 he's doing both, he backed up his save
[4:37:10] <Monkeyweed21> shame he wont see the best bosses in this game
[4:37:14] <%Lion_kun> his posture regen is too quick
[4:37:14] <ScreamLord> He invented a big chunk of your move list
[4:37:17] <tri3dgE027> Consider going in with a Yellow Candy
[4:37:18] <CrimsonGargoyle> well swordfights - you also don't wanna get fuckin stabbed LUL
[4:37:25] <+RayDaug> Hesitation is defeat Woolie. Don't let them set the pace of the fight.
[4:37:31] <%Lion_kun> get in and react
[4:37:33] <Monkeyweed21> @LodiFrostbeard oh nvm as long as he gets to fight Owl
[4:37:38] <chronoxgp> off camera lol
[4:37:53] <noobpsyboticus> backing off is bad advice
[4:38:04] <%mason1196> Time limit?
[4:38:14] <hassanico1> @WoolieVersus if you do grind, at least download the old save so you'll have the resources on both files
[4:38:14] <chronoxgp> well im trying to get him to swing once instead of just looking at him
[4:38:15] <zamzoph> Yeah.... you haven't learned Emma
[4:38:18] <VJdarkworld> that lunge, is that a mikiri counter?
[4:38:24] <%Cybermancer> learned her good, huh?
[4:38:30] <DeathByPoke7> doodOne doodOne
[4:38:42] <CrimsonGargoyle> @RayDaug or one can flow with their pace and counter at all the right moments, that's how i did it! like a watery dance
[4:38:54] <RenFuuma> lol....
[4:38:56] <CrimsonGargoyle> LUL
[4:39:02] <tri3dgE027> retroS retroSLICE khadDed
[4:39:05] <+Pinkiefan> How to beat Emma: Move left.
[4:39:13] <IndoorSitup> m u l l i g a n
[4:39:18] <CrimsonGargoyle> Emmaghedon back at it again
[4:39:23] <%RioGascar> evo19Tilt2 ?
[4:39:26] <DeathByPoke7> doodOne doodNo doodOne
[4:39:35] <CrimsonGargoyle> doodCap doodCrazy
[4:39:41] <noobpsyboticus> @woolieversus don't be sorry, it's tricky. backing off is bad advice. this is a posture fight
[4:40:15] <+RayDaug> @CrimsonGargoyle you can do that, but that just makes the fight take longer and increases the chances of you making a mistake. Take the initiative and you can finish the fight faster and safer.
[4:40:33] <CrimsonGargoyle> @RayDaug sure
[4:40:39] <tri3dgE027> Opening with a Jumping Slash after a boss' recovery frames allows you to get in two free hits of posture damage
[4:40:44] <xeros720> the stuff that works is good
[4:40:44] <a_mad_dragon> if you can't beat the student how can you expect to beat the teacher
[4:41:15] <xeros720> oh, did he forget how to punish moves like sweeps and thrusts?
[4:41:33] <+0oki> It’s all good woolie, next session you could focus on practicing mikiris. I promise that will be super helpful with isshin too because his move set is similar to hers
[4:41:38] <%Lion_kun> woolie's fought a simian for so long, he forgot how to fight people
[4:41:41] <IndoorSitup> The student learns from the teacher. The teacher learns from the master. The master learns from the god.
[4:41:41] <LodiFrostbeard> @xeros720 pretty much
[4:41:42] <psydaku> Fun fact: Isshin is voiced by Seto Kaiba
[4:41:47] <CrimsonGargoyle> @WoolieVersus switch listening and crouch around, no more accidents
[4:41:56] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> thanks Minh LUL
[4:41:59] <VJdarkworld> mikiri counter and goomba stomp gonna help alot
[4:42:00] <noobpsyboticus> LUL
[4:42:03] <MrGremy> pro tips
[4:42:04] <xeros720> i trust minh brought him up, but man, i'd say most of the game is learning them
[4:42:08] <tri3dgE027> Dashing forward to Emma's left side allows you to dodge majority of her attacks
[4:42:10] <henshin2289> Yeah bro you ass we all know
[4:42:12] <%RioGascar> evo19Tilt2

[4:42:38] <+Andrizzleton> Tension counter
[4:42:39] <bear_breaker20> @psydaku that is a very fun fact
[4:42:43] <IndoorSitup> capice?
[4:42:51] <+Pinkiefan> He’s just rusty. This game punishes even the slightest amount of rust.

[4:45:29] <laserbeaming> So... has anyone told Woolie how long the game is if he takes the other choice?
[4:45:31] <MrGremy> @WoolieVersus will you stream daemon X machina?

[0:07:24] <%Ninestempest> cursory reminder that beastars manga/anime are both super good and it all deserves attentino but i'm not sure about the stage play
[0:07:43] <%gatorafan> the stage play just got announced I think?
[0:07:44] <haisho> hey if Bleach can get a stage play I don't see why Beastars can't
[0:07:44] <countgaculatv> Better than Subhuman @absolute_cagemony
[0:07:48] <ginjais> bluto2Smug
[0:07:48] <Mendin> Woolie's in the Side Quest Gauntlet optional part before Shin Endgame
[0:07:49] <%gatorafan> there is no way to know
[0:07:53] <%Ninestempest> start of december but yeah
[0:07:54] <%CommanderSqueaks> @ninestempest Also that the anime has been confirmed for a second season.
[0:07:55] <ELJOVENBATALI> despierta hombre de basura

[0:08:15] <Superbro64> Reminder that DJ Professor K is King and deserves his win
[0:08:20] <%Ninestempest> i watched the anime then read the manga from chapter 1 all the way to 80 last night
[0:08:22] <%Ninestempest> which took like
[0:08:23] <Superbro64> understand understand
[0:08:26] <%Ninestempest> actually more like 7 hours
[0:08:38] <Mendin> Now go read the manga written by Beastars' author's dad: BAKI
[0:08:43] <%Ninestempest> god dammit
[0:08:43] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule

[0:09:13] <haisho> see
[0:09:32] <Belutima> YO AIR GEAR, did I hear that right @ggbhtg
[0:09:36] <%gatorafan> Beastars look like the kind of series I can wait for new episodes, so I'll just watch the anime as it airs (not that I started watching it yet)
[0:09:44] <Superbro64> enough about this stage play, a new sonic tv show could be in the works
[0:09:49] <FuqBoiSlim> @ggbhtg the roller skate anime?? lmaoo that's crazy
[0:09:53] <Superbro64> its not boom S3, but it will suffice
[0:10:04] <+ggbhtg> @belutima find a screw to end your fucking sorrows
[0:10:12] <Superbro64> boom S2 is top tier tho, easily the best sonic media sans the comics in a WHILE

[0:12:57] <kiryutonight> THANK YOU!
[0:13:02] <Mendin> If he didn't do sidequests, yes. As it is, minimum 1 more session, likely 2 more
[0:13:12] <EndgameContent> I'm skipping all the sidequest streams since I haven't done them yet, is Woolie done with them?
[0:13:13] <%BallerSwagBro9k> DISNEY SQUAD OPEN UP
[0:13:15] <%Ninestempest> isn't the fucking avengers theme like
[0:13:17] <sperium3000> One theme doesn't mean the entire osts aren't bad
[0:13:19] <%Ninestempest> 4 fucking measures
[0:13:25] <sperium3000> Black Panther had a good OST too
[0:13:29] <Mendin> @EndgameContent See you next week then
[0:13:30] <kiryutonight> I've been saying the same thing about the Avengers theme since that video came out!
[0:13:34] <+ggbhtg> btw, I like how the Air Gear anime ended RIGHT BEFORE ALL THE BULLSHIT
[0:13:41] <+Scarlet_Crow> I was talking to coworkers around the calendar. I forgot we get off for New Years. I said that I forgot. My coworkers thought I meant I forgot what day New Years was. Then I was like... wait... dammit!
[0:13:43] <%gatorafan> I can sing Mahvel's Spooderman theme woolieCHAN
[0:13:44] <sperium3000> Woole you're talking abotu ONE song
[0:14:00] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BTW The Madaloriian has done more good to the Star Wars franchise than the last 6 films. SEason just ended, its good, go watch it
[0:14:02] <musti_jaja_> hey woolz! hi everyone!
[0:14:05] <+ggbhtg> It was ONE SONG, guy Kappa
[0:14:05] <TheUrbanBuddha> Woolie is such a Marvel mark
[0:14:14] <%Ninestempest> >says it is a false equivalency
[0:14:14] <sperium3000> You're also doing a false equivalancy
[0:14:16] <TheUrbanBuddha> All but ONE is a wash
[0:14:18] <%Ninestempest> >is using a false equivalency
[0:14:19] <EndgameContent> @Mendin Oh nice, glad to see he still has some game left. Gonna keep the steam on and mute Chrome to boost metrics though
[0:14:29] <EndgameContent> *stream
[0:14:32] <%Ninestempest> the avengers theme is liek fucking 8 notes
[0:14:33] <SomersaultJustice> I want them to use the cartoon Mega Man intro for the Mega Man movie
[0:14:41] <%Ninestempest> dooooooooooooo do dooooooooo
[0:14:44] <%Ninestempest> dooo dooo dooooooooo
[0:14:47] <sperium3000> You know what I remember? Kilmonger's theme
[0:14:51] <sperium3000> Ominous hip hop
[0:14:55] <sperium3000> That shit was dope
[0:15:03] <sperium3000> Now tell me what the fuck Thanos' theme is like
[0:15:10] <FuqBoiSlim> only movie song from the last 5 years I can remember is the hereditary ost and that's cuz it was used in memes
[0:15:12] <sperium3000> Does Loki have one?
[0:15:40] <EndgameContent> Indivisible OST is good
[0:15:46] <FuqBoiSlim> Loki's theme dont even slap. no sub-bass no hi-hats nothing.
[0:15:46] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1210124488463077376
[0:15:47] <Haarute> i dig the indivisible ost quite a bit. it's on spotify too.
[0:15:47] <jase__x> their are very few memorable themes in the avengers/marvel movies
[0:16:02] <sperium3000> For the longest time I was waiting for the moment the movies would blindside me with Captain America's theme from Marvel Vs. Capcom and it never happened. I know it's silly.
[0:16:04] <EndgameContent> That Kikuta tho
[0:16:07] <%gatorafan> not a fan of most of it, but it has some winners
[0:16:08] <+BoBoGaijin> cryDrool cryDrool cryDrool cryDrool
[0:16:21] <%BallerSwagBro9k> IMO E1M! and BFG Division are 2 greatest themes in gaming
[0:16:23] <+ggbhtg> speaking of theme songs, did you watch any more Shippuden OPs yet? @woolieversus
[0:16:54] <sperium3000> Subhuman is good now, Woolie
[0:17:00] <sperium3000> Also the LittleVmills cover is cool
[0:17:02] <+ggbhtg> the 2nd version tho
[0:17:03] <oAznoUta> Subhuman wasn't that bad before
[0:17:06] <%gatorafan> no it's not.
[0:17:09] <sperium3000> It kinda was
[0:17:13] <%gatorafan> But he still must play it
[0:17:15] <+steelmorrigan> ymmv?
[0:17:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> But after Devil Triiger all other DMC themes are pointless
[0:17:29] <SomersaultJustice> debbo trigger
[0:17:36] <EndgameContent> The LP theme
[0:17:38] <Ashenik1> hello there o/
[0:17:39] <oAznoUta> I mean I get how people didn't like it, but I get what Capcom was going for with it
[0:17:45] <sperium3000> Why you dissing LittleVMills, Woolie?
[0:17:45] <Mendin> The time has come, and so have I
[0:17:46] <SiegeJay> Silver bullet is god
[0:17:51] <+ggbhtg> people slept on Dante's MVCI theme
[0:17:58] <+BoBoGaijin> then it goes to crazy awesome orchestra
[0:18:04] <sperium3000> I slept on it because MVCI has a bad soundtrack
[0:18:22] <FuqBoiSlim> MVCI had a soundtrack??
[0:18:33] <%Ecchigun> we back in!
[0:18:35] <sperium3000> "gravely growling" also describes the songs from DMC3
[0:18:38] <Superbro64> dmcv themes in general are a aquired taste in my opinion, sans devil trigger
[0:18:45] <oAznoUta> liked his MvCI theme too. had final boss vibes to it
[0:18:48] <Superbro64> pretty average overall if you cant get into it
[0:18:57] <Superbro64> good thing you can change the music tracks
[0:19:00] <haisho> worse than Devil Trigger, but I'll be damned if it doesn't have the best transition to S Rank
[0:19:00] <sperium3000> PLEASE DON'T SING IT
[0:19:06] <%gatorafan> I like V's theme
[0:19:10] <+ggbhtg> speaking of theme songs, did you watch any more Shippuden OPs yet? @woolieversus
[0:19:12] <%BoBoGaijin> II_BoBo_II subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:19:13] <jase__x> lol I remember V's track more over Dante's
[0:19:18] <Superbro64> V is SUPER aquired taste I feel

[0:19:22] <Mendin> Goth Theatre Kid energy maxed
[0:19:26] <Superbro64> you have to be in that kind of music

[0:19:40] <trainedtarget> I just bought Fight of Animals today. It's the first time I've ever owned a fighting game, and I can't even get past the first character in Adventure mode. I think I hate fighting games and they make me want to die
[0:19:41] <+ggbhtg> btw, savior, bloodstain, hellfire, shadooooow
[0:19:47] <sperium3000> OH GOD

[0:20:42] <+ggbhtg> speaking of theme songs, did you watch any more Shippuden OPs yet? @woolieversus
[0:20:45] <sperium3000> He is lying, Reggie
[0:20:46] <sperium3000> He is weak
[0:20:50] <haisho> what
[0:20:51] <Superbro64> if dmcv is patched with ACTUAL multiplayer, it might be a perfect game
[0:20:55] <ELJOVENBATALI> i am not human
[0:20:59] <sperium3000> Let's spam "Play Subhuman yo ucoward"
[0:21:01] <Superbro64> but it is fantastic as is
[0:21:07] <%ozzrabbit> Tell him why it was pulled
[0:21:11] <+ggbhtg> Version 2 is ok tho
[0:21:12] <SomersaultJustice> I don't know what Subhuman is
[0:21:13] <zaitje> Why not let Reggie listen to Subhuman?
[0:21:19] <ELJOVENBATALI> play subhuman you coward
[0:21:22] <haisho> oh
[0:21:28] <haisho> that
[0:21:29] <sperium3000> Why you dunking on LittleVMills, Woolie?
[0:21:32] <Superbro64> grooming I think
[0:21:34] <%allups> what up yall
[0:22:07] <oAznoUta> play him the songs, Woolie
[0:22:10] <sperium3000> "Fix it"

[0:22:51] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:22:51] <Superbro64> some people can argue DmC special is better than 1
[0:23:06] <+gustavozxd> I don't like 4 anymore
[0:23:13] <sperium3000> Those people have acquired tastes
[0:23:15] <take_the_bus_part_deux> dmc4 is better than dmc5 though, you can not like it ofcourse
[0:23:31] <sperium3000> How is half a game better than a complete one?
[0:23:32] <Superbro64> Max playthrough of 4 was ROUGH. I forgot how bad that 2nd half was
[0:23:36] <+gustavozxd> after going through 4 on all difficulties and getting S ranks i can't stand that game anymore
[0:23:39] <+ggbhtg> I shall play the game without spider grunts, because fuck spiders
[0:23:48] <SiegeJay> DMC5 Special edition??? PogChamp
[0:23:57] <+ggbhtg> V E R G I L D L C W H E N
[0:24:04] <take_the_bus_part_deux> it's better because you don't rely on a youtube video personality to tell you it's not
[0:24:05] <%allups> where does DMC fall?
[0:24:14] <Superbro64> he probably liked 1 more then 4 by the end. Completely destroyed the wind in his sails
[0:24:17] <+ggbhtg> speaking of theme songs, did you watch any more Shippuden OPs yet? @woolieversus
[0:24:22] <%gatorafan> And 5, he's playable NEVER because fuck me
[0:24:25] <oAznoUta> screw Vergil. give me Lady
[0:24:28] <+KNYGHT87> woolieSMUG_SA
[0:24:35] <take_the_bus_part_deux> DmC WutFace
[0:24:44] <jase__x> there ar mods that let you play Vergil
[0:24:59] <%xdeathknightx> For Minh it's DMC2, DMC2, DMC2, DMC2 and then DMC5
[0:25:04] <+gustavozxd> it's almost a completely different genre
[0:25:16] <haisho> good game, terrible DMC
[0:25:19] <+ggbhtg> Does the Vergil mod have all his hotboxes yet?
[0:25:23] <+TopTieramisu> indivisible looks a little different today
[0:25:34] <+ggbhtg> speaking of theme songs, did you watch any more Shippuden OPs yet? @woolieversus
[0:25:44] <+gustavozxd> vergil in DmC is the worst though
[0:25:48] <Belutima> I want DMC 2 with dino, with the dmc5 Gameplay JUST to spite people cohhEvil
[0:26:00] <+bv728> 5 is best for live action cutscenes
[0:26:07] <+TopTieramisu> the side characters are often more fun than the main
[0:26:11] <%Afterman_> V is super fucking fun to play.
[0:26:22] <+ggbhtg> if it wouldnt be a marketing disaster, I wouldnt mind Itsuno doing what he wants
[0:26:26] <+Matt_Made> V is so weird
[0:26:26] <+gustavozxd> V in dmd though, or even worse hell and hell
[0:26:29] <kimonochrono> devil may guy
[0:26:45] <+TopTieramisu> can't wait for V to be resurrected as Vi in DMC VI
[0:26:51] <%Afterman_> V i think is actually my favorite dmc character
[0:26:52] <+ggbhtg> V could use more moves in the end
[0:27:07] <%gatorafan> Has Woolie read that V manga?
[0:27:16] <+gustavozxd> the problem is that the summons take damage, so in hell and hell you're omega fucked
[0:27:34] <FuqBoiSlim> V is fun and it took a few missions for me to grow on him but I cant go back to him after playing AC man i cant
[0:27:44] <+ggbhtg> V didnt have so many moves because of being a new character, but in hindsight, he needs more
[0:27:57] <+bv728> V was a real SUPER GOOD proof of concept

[0:28:06] <%kimonochrono> kimonochrono subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:28:13] <+TopTieramisu> V is the Kazumi Mishima of DMC V?
[0:28:13] <jase__x> I agree V himself needed more moves while his familiiars are pretty fun
[0:28:17] <%gatorafan> I really expected V to get more demons as the game went on.
[0:28:23] <+ggbhtg> Azula v Kirbo dunzo? cool
[0:28:27] <%Afterman_> its like a beach episode in anime
[0:28:33] <%gatorafan> so my expectations were NOT EXCEEDED
[0:28:49] <+Matt_Made> Went swimming to find the plot
[0:28:51] <boxofhooligans> Will there be a DMC 5 Special Edition?
[0:28:56] <%allups> couples go to the beach
[0:29:07] <FuqBoiSlim> @boxofhooligans if you pray hard enough maybe
[0:29:08] <Superbro64> I always touch water with a shirt on, sans showering
[0:29:13] <+ggbhtg> shirtless? was it EVEN raining?
[0:29:15] <Superbro64> never shirtless ever again
[0:29:18] <+tuchpi> but do you do a swimming date? wtf?
[0:29:21] <+bv728> DmC: Devil May Cry 5: Special Edition 2
[0:29:38] <boxofhooligans> @fuqboislim damn, I thought their might have been an announcement i missed
[0:29:46] <+ggbhtg> "I was in the POOL!"
[0:29:53] <Ashenik1> I just rewatch Kakashi Zabuza fight on YT and....... oh man what happened to the series :/

[0:30:03] <Superbro64> I also despise chlorine with a burning passion
[0:30:20] <jase__x> Man none of it is Sincere
[0:30:22] <Prevot> LUL
[0:30:27] <+ggbhtg> Sa soo kay, is really cool tho
[0:30:28] <+tuchpi> LOL
[0:30:32] <+ggbhtg> speaking of theme songs, did you watch any more Shippuden OPs yet? @woolieversus
[0:30:32] <Superbro64> people who can open their eyes in public pools are gods to me, that shit burns my eyes out
[0:30:34] <%karldeck> It's fun when I make donation an it bring donation
[0:30:35] <thegreatbambe> <3
[0:30:35] <boxofhooligans> stoopid!
[0:30:35] <%gatorafan> Hate threads FeelsBadMan
[0:30:37] <+Matt_Made> Is it that serious?
[0:30:38] <Ashenik1> Woolie are you going to watch Netflix Witcher ?
[0:30:43] <+ggbhtg> I will fight and tryyy
[0:30:44] <+gustavozxd> i was thinking, imagine if at the end of dmc5 first trailer, it zooms out of a screen, someone spits on it and it's dino
[0:30:54] <boxofhooligans> apatSkelmo
[0:30:55] <Prevot> its okay woolz you can redeem yourself LUL
[0:30:57] <+ggbhtg> I REJECT YOUR REALITY
[0:31:05] <Superbro64> if people fight you, it's fair to fight back I feel
[0:31:09] <+ggbhtg> AND SUBSTITUTE YOUR OWN
[0:31:22] <+AmanDotZip> what about counts
[0:31:24] <+ggbhtg> Woolie has a Ninja AGENDA, obviously
[0:31:26] <Superbro64> if anything, NO ONE I've seen started threads defending Sakura
[0:31:34] <fruit_pie_the_magician> That's just Sasuke fanboys getting pissed off at you for calling out their emo god
[0:31:34] <+Matt_Made> @ggbhtg Wait....that....thats not right.
[0:31:35] <%gatorafan> you really shouldn't be looking at Nardo threads on the reedits. Some people just spoil things
[0:31:38] <Superbro64> no one is touching that minefield Kappa
[0:31:59] <+gustavozxd> nardo?
[0:32:02] <+ggbhtg> Shifting the Shippuden Narrtive, Woolie is! Kappa
[0:32:11] <+tuchpi> Naruto Woolie hate threads LUL what a world
[0:32:22] <boxofhooligans> Summon your ninja headbands!
[0:32:27] <+ggbhtg> @matt_made Izanami bro Kappa
[0:32:47] <+Matt_Made> Can we not?
[0:32:51] <+Matt_Made> Thats scary
[0:32:53] <%gatorafan> if it's any consolation, people brought that up on those threads
[0:32:57] <Ilkim61> Does Dio at the start of P3 count as redeemed since he basically served a century-long prison sentence?
[0:32:59] <reasonance> sasuke's redemption never bothered me much, because he kept failing. his rap sheet has a whole lot of "attempted" crimes, but aside from a couple samurai guards and ninja hitler he has no real bodycount
[0:33:05] <Superbro64> people forget things, DMCV was FAR longer then 2 weeks ago brah doodSinwata
[0:33:08] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Eh, Vergil can't really be held responsible for what Urizen did, or even for what V does.
[0:33:08] <weissguard> @woolieversus people are dumb
[0:33:10] <+ggbhtg> Vur Gil did nothing wrong. @woolieversus MEMES THO WOOLIE
[0:33:14] <%Afterman_> hes getting (an attempt at being) redeemed through V more or less
[0:33:17] <+ggbhtg> GOTTA MEME FAST
[0:33:17] <Belutima> Short ATTENTION SPAN woopsADD
[0:33:32] <+ggbhtg> NO TIME FOR LOGIC gotta meme NOOOOOW
[0:33:36] <SiegeJay> @WoolieVersus The Majority of people are stupid. Never leave things to an angry mob
[0:34:09] <+ggbhtg> I saw an out of context clip on Twitter, I ACCEPT THIS AS GOSPEL
[0:34:14] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I mean he fucked over DMC3's city, but since then, he hasn't really done much
[0:34:14] <Superbro64> I liked reading threads on people thinking that they are anti vaxxers because they play on wifi, immediately forgetting that the point of the discussion was defending delay based netcode LUL
[0:34:20] <%Afterman_> that depends on the person who is talking imo Reggie
[0:34:22] <Superbro64> real smart move folks
[0:34:24] <+steelmorrigan> People are dumb.
[0:34:24] <Belakitu> doodBigBrain Big Brainon Reggie
[0:34:25] <dero45> just dont give a fuk
[0:34:31] <Haarute> what you think and say is different from what people inferred from it and it sucks.
[0:34:36] <+tuchpi> "Oh she's not a child, she's just Japanese!"
[0:34:41] <Belutima> something you gotta realise woolie is on the internet you need SHORT concise answers and statements woopsISee people can't handle long explanations ashuSlain
[0:34:54] <+ggbhtg> People never forget to say anything in a conversation ONLINE, OBVIOUSLY. Just edit your LIVE DISCUSSION. Smh.
[0:34:55] <+gustavozxd> all i know is that the prequels are still the worst
[0:34:59] <SiegeJay> @tuchpi Is that a podcast title?
[0:35:05] <%kimonochrono> deep talks today
[0:35:16] <%Afterman_> @gustavozxd but they led to the best Star Wars media ever, TCW and Rebels
[0:35:24] <Belutima> That's advice you can take in REAL LIFE aswell against certain people woopsISee
[0:35:32] <take_the_bus_part_deux> you're making a mistake!
[0:35:40] <SiegeJay> @gustavozxd Yes! but it is a testament to how bad these disney movies are
[0:35:45] <+gustavozxd> @Afterman_ well yeah tbh republic commando is one of the very best SW games
[0:35:46] <+tuchpi> @siegejay LUL I wish, from yesterdays DS stream
[0:35:50] <%gatorafan> in the case of Vergil, I'm pretty sure people forgot for whatever reason.
[0:35:53] <+ggbhtg> Crazy Talk taking effect: I can't believe Woolie HATES Vergil!
[0:36:01] <%gatorafan> you were pretty clear on V's LP
[0:36:18] <boxofhooligans> play furry battles! fuck the h8ers, Devil Trigger the h8ers away!
[0:36:24] <+Matt_Made> Virgil: Terror in the streets, Freak in the sheets.
[0:36:27] <+ggbhtg> I cant believe Woolie HATES Vergil and killed that guy that time!

[0:36:32] <Belutima> Woolie the Liar woopsSlain
[0:36:33] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Ugh thats the kinda of thing that keeps you awake at night
[0:36:35] <fruit_pie_the_magician> He didn't do anything in five though. Urizen is just a giant butthole, he isn't Vergil, and Vergil didn't make him on purpose
[0:36:52] <+conqab> pretty much
[0:36:56] <+conqab> kills em

[0:37:21] <Superbro64> look up THE YULE MAN
[0:37:24] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Only Krampus knows
[0:37:27] <Superbro64> yeyeyye YULE MAN
[0:37:32] <boxofhooligans> Cant run when you get kramps!
[0:37:34] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> they get returned in the morning would be hilarious
[0:37:36] <%allups> u get didlled
[0:37:43] <+ggbhtg> Bad End
[0:37:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie used Yahoo Answers as references in his college papers confirmed.
[0:37:49] <%gatorafan> nothing is scarier than nothing daedra1DrunkTibs
[0:37:56] <+steelmorrigan> You get replaced by a fetch in Fae tales
[0:38:12] <+ggbhtg> what is there to like, tbh?

[0:39:31] <+ggbhtg> that was a donation message? good shit LUL
[0:39:33] <depressedpepega> Is his cape a robot too? moon2M
[0:39:41] <+gustavozxd> they think they're literally anti vaxxers? LUL
[0:40:01] <+ggbhtg> Wi fi players REFUSE to plug in the needle!
[0:40:11] <SomersaultJustice> I wouldn't say wifi players are anti-vaxxers, sometimes wifi is the only option they have
[0:40:19] <exglebster> If delay based netcode defenders are anti-vaxers than SFV netcode is a vaccine that gives actual autistm
[0:40:27] <dero45> but what about the cell phone hot spoters
[0:40:27] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> anti vax is too strong to clump onto a person that thinks reback is good, anti vax kills children
[0:40:28] <Belutima> PUT IN THE CABLE YOU ANTI VAXXER abbaREE
[0:40:38] <Superbro64> @somersaultjustice that is their argument, but they cant take the joke too
[0:40:50] <Superbro64> long story short, add filter options to matchmaking
[0:40:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> @somersaultjustice It's more people who do have a choice, but refuse to.
[0:41:04] <valriot> WiFi is my only option though, it's easy when Pat stream 2 days a week cos he's lazy and still gets donations to pay for overly expensive internet
[0:41:22] <+tuchpi> I love that people too the antivax wifi joke seriously, RED BARS OUT!!
[0:41:33] <+gustavozxd> internet cables are so cheap though
[0:41:37] <+tuchpi> you got it Woolie :)
[0:41:51] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I'm working with 20mb down and 1mb up

[0:42:14] <dero45> i let them know you think vergil did nothing wrong
[0:42:18] <NiktenKing> alright, so defending Vergil, gotcha :p

[0:43:01] <+tuchpi> i remember when Woolie explained what an Option Select is on like sbfc 70
[0:43:06] <%BoBoGaijin> i loved your indepth podcast on StrIVe, id love more
[0:43:07] <+lordginger1> More jargon, more jargon, more jargon

[0:43:17] <+ggbhtg> We got you figured out, @woolieversus NO INDIVIDUALITY ALLOWED
[0:43:19] <dero45> its nothing you can do about it lol
[0:43:29] <nitro4life2> Whatshumacallit?
[0:43:33] <%lordsdb> @WoolieVersus I say fuck it, if people are still going to say your saying fighting game garen then might as well go full throttle!
[0:43:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> Memes are simultaneously shortlived and immortal.
[0:43:35] <Superbro64> the reddit is pretty loosely enforced, for better or worse
[0:43:36] <Oak_bogle> I miss ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a good one too‚Äù to be honest.
[0:43:43] <Superbro64> Carl and the crew still do good work though
[0:43:49] <+xeromage> Meanwhile Pat turns every discussion into a Warframe commercial
[0:43:53] <SomersaultJustice> More Jargon! More Asbestos!
[0:43:55] <+ggbhtg> it really WAS a good one, too
[0:43:57] <dero45> @CommanderSqueaks unless ur DSP
[0:43:57] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:44:00] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Dude, we're not listening to it because WE care about it, we're entertained by YOU care about it. I bet a violent youtube rant that consisted of 85% FGC lingo would be fucking awesome
[0:44:02] <Mendin> Pat hasnt played Warframe in like 4 months
[0:44:21] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Pat gave up his crack addiction?
[0:44:24] <Superbro64> there must be ALOT of straight up porn that doesnt get into the subreddit cuz of them. I sure dont want their job
[0:44:26] <%gatorafan> @xeromage you are doing the thing, Pat hasn't touched Warframe in months
[0:44:26] <%jinking79> gettin all the side quest finish up before the Cat and Final Boss
[0:44:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> @dero45 Say what you want DSP has always been on brand.
[0:44:40] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Pat will be back, he's indulging his other vices right now
[0:44:46] <+ggbhtg> but he corrupted Space Mom with Jojo, therefore HE CAN NEVER ESCAPE
[0:44:55] <Mendin> Pat rubbing his orb
[0:45:00] <%gatorafan> as Soon as a good update comes out maybe
[0:45:10] <%gatorafan> but probably not before that
[0:45:11] <+ggbhtg> (neither of which is a bad)
[0:45:26] <+ggbhtg> Stream cancelled
[0:45:29] <FuqBoiSlim> What GaaS timesink is he slumming in now? is he still playing lol?
[0:45:36] <%allups> a glass of water helps actually
[0:45:45] <%gatorafan> running throught the RE series
[0:45:48] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> just be stronger
[0:45:52] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Empyrean is like....i don't know if I want a crew of fucking randos, because randos are all I have, and my clan is stupid
[0:45:54] <Superbro64> reminder that no matter how bad the subreddit gets, we will still be better then r/Kappa
[0:45:55] <Mendin> He's back into Destiny for a big series event
[0:46:05] <Gutsandlove> so just to confirm, how does woolie feel about ajna now?
[0:46:18] <+ggbhtg> big hatred?

[0:46:32] <Superbro64> LUL
[0:46:39] <fruit_pie_the_magician> That fucking Rebecca Kars cosplay was on point as fuck
[0:46:58] <Gutsandlove> heh, yeah she has problems
[0:47:21] <+ggbhtg> I would ask someone else tho
[0:47:25] <%gatorafan> Also, the dad is dying
[0:47:30] <Haarute> you have like 4 air dashes by now. also dad is dying of cancer and nobody cares.
[0:47:42] <Gutsandlove> got it
[0:47:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> @haarute Even the dad doesn't care
[0:47:50] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> probably not the time to ask but I wonder what Pat and Woolz GotY?
[0:47:53] <SomersaultJustice> how far into the game is woolie now?
[0:48:02] <Gutsandlove> almost at the end
[0:48:04] <Haarute> @CommanderSqueaks he cares the least of anyone lmao
[0:48:13] <Mendin> He's doing the pre-Endgame sidequest cleanup
[0:48:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> @raaaaainmaker Outer Wilds and DMC5 probably.
[0:48:35] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Sounds about right

[0:49:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @Superbro64 Its....ok gameplay is the key element
[0:49:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> @superbro64 Btw, your name is completely invisible in Dark Mode.
[0:49:44] <Skeletonmanners> its kinda just an excuse
[0:49:52] <%gatorafan> bad, but I wouldn't call it the worst I've seen.
[0:49:53] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Some character jit home others not so much
[0:49:56] <%BallerSwagBro9k> hit
[0:50:01] <exglebster> this game looks so empty

[0:51:04] <+gustavozxd> yo this song tho
[0:51:29] <SomersaultJustice> I think Secret of Mana composer worked on this game right?
[0:51:44] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yes i belive so
[0:52:18] <%gatorafan> these sidequests bosses need some tweaking
[0:52:18] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> the Ben Swolo chest window energy
[0:52:19] <CursedNobleman> @SomersaultJustice just looked it up, yep
[0:52:21] <%BallerSwagBro9k> The final dungeon to the last boss is sooooo tedious tho
[0:52:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> way too long

[0:52:50] <%CaptainPileDriver> especially the secret area

[0:52:58] <Prevot> ninja mommy Kreygasm
[0:53:01] <xiccy> I loved the final dungeon's platforming
[0:53:05] <%jinking79> Hot Momma
[0:53:06] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Now i am the master
[0:53:20] <SiegeJay> boob shine!!!
[0:53:24] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> put on more clohes mother
[0:53:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> @captainpiledriver The final dungeon is wholly dependent on whether or not you like the game's platforming.
[0:53:35] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Oh man wait till you see the last boss <3 <3 <3
[0:53:38] <Prevot> she looks like she's gonna call me shonen
[0:53:49] <%CaptainPileDriver> yeah but if you're that far in the game clearly you're fine with it enough to get there
[0:53:55] <FuqBoiSlim> I lost Kreygasm
[0:53:56] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> See a therapist Ren
[0:54:25] <exglebster> aren't you supposed to take damage from those?
[0:54:40] <Mendin> RIP Ren's dead boyfriend

[0:54:46] <%gatorafan> this map is nothing but lies and deception daedra1CryingTibs
[0:54:55] <%BallerSwagBro9k> So guys who is best waifu? (I say Thorani and Leiliani)
[0:55:12] <Mendin> Thorani is not waifu. Thorani is MUTHER
[0:55:16] <exglebster> Mike Z
[0:55:28] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Mils can be waifu...
[0:55:37] <%gatorafan> Why pick a waifu when you have NAGA RIDER
[0:55:43] <Prevot> milfs are by definition waifus
[0:55:47] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @gatorafan This man speaks true
[0:55:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> @gatorafan The correct answer.
[0:56:07] <Haarute> you can talk to your crew and they'll tell you
[0:56:23] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> milfs are usually taken waifus
[0:56:27] <Mendin> @WoolieVersus The Sumeru Point of No Return is late and very unmissable, so don't worry about dipping into there
[0:56:40] <FuqBoiSlim> I want Yan to kick me in half
[0:56:54] <Gutsandlove> you got to find Mike D's cat
[0:57:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> @mendin Yes, I was nervous about that until I saw the actual point of no return and it was STUPID Blatant
[0:57:09] <Gutsandlove> Mike z's
[0:57:11] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh no
[0:57:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> They're doing it
[0:57:21] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @WoolieVersus As a metter of fact there is a portal at the point of no return so you can go up Sumeru unworried
[0:57:22] <exglebster> Monkey Island ass OST
[0:57:58] <+Matt_Made> Tai Krung is a cool setting
[0:57:58] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1210124488463077376
[0:58:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> @woolieversus You WILL KNOW when you've reached the point of no return, the game explicitly tells you. You're fine.
[0:58:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> And theres a portal
[0:58:44] <Haarute> @WoolieVersus you can talk to your party members and they'll tell you where to go for their stuff
[0:59:35] <Mendin> The Story icon is just the Chakra Gate
[0:59:39] <Mendin> the brown one, that is
[0:59:46] <Mendin> It's a map bugaboo
[1:00:38] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> jesus that dash grunt is taxing
[1:00:49] <SomersaultJustice> GRAHHHH
[1:01:14] <+Matt_Made> GRAAHH ERRWHERE
[1:01:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> @raaaaainmaker I eventually got neuron inhibition and stopped hearing it.
[1:01:27] <Prevot> all these grunts will be very useful to zone
[1:01:33] <exglebster> I still can't get over how little there is to do on these maps
[1:01:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> @prevot "will", you sure that tense is correct?
[1:01:55] <%gatorafan> I think the grunt is short enough to not become annoying
[1:02:31] <+Matt_Made> I wish she went WEEEEE one time.
[1:02:47] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Literally hear her coming four floors away
[1:03:27] <laguerrilha> chat "Ajna is the worst" means as poorly written or she is a shitty person?
[1:03:38] <Prevot> yes
[1:03:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> @raaaaainmaker This is why no one ever acts surprised when she arrives.
[1:03:45] <%Ecchigun> how is the game so far ?
[1:03:48] <%Ecchigun> it looks cool
[1:04:01] <%jinking79> the fuck r those colors
[1:04:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> @laguerrilha Both aren't mutually exclusive.
[1:04:23] <laguerrilha> @CommanderSqueaks so she is both?
[1:04:31] <BreakersAweigh> oh hell yeah! white power ranger naga rider
[1:04:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> @breakersaweigh Why do you do this, now I cannot unsee.
[1:05:14] <BreakersAweigh> thats because thats what it is !!
[1:05:14] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:05:35] <SomersaultJustice> white power ranger huh?
[1:06:09] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Did they claim them as their prison bitches?
[1:06:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> These bros speaking truth bro.
[1:06:19] <jase__x> just gonna let the monsters that killed our family go
[1:06:34] <exglebster> nice writing
[1:06:45] <jase__x> off to go kill more families
[1:06:47] <Mendin> They're literally the Aztec Gods of the Underworld so
[1:06:54] <Mendin> Woolie PEEP those new COLORS
[1:06:55] <%jinking79> LUL
[1:07:05] <ManlyMcBeefington> the purple tunnel?
[1:07:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> @mendin Ancient gods who play Bleetzboll
[1:07:18] <%gatorafan> Woolie tries to get away from the topic of redemption and forgiveness but the universe keeps dragging him back daedra1LaughingTibs
[1:07:35] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> sounds like a shonan arc
[1:08:02] <%jinking79> thanks Dio Brando
[1:08:27] <Skeletonmanners> kinda annoying how many ceilings are unexplored on the map and theres never anything there
[1:08:29] <+Matt_Made> You have the gates as well so the boat is redundant
[1:08:30] <StarlitStunner> vineKirb_HF
[1:08:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> Look at the map, they're all... Wait is Woolie serious?
[1:08:42] <Skeletonmanners> gotta do the SOTN thing of bashing your head all the time
[1:08:45] <+Piemen99> isnt this place a mega continent?
[1:08:47] <Medo3G> Aren't they all on the same landmass
[1:08:55] <ManlyMcBeefington> purple tunnel
[1:09:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> @piemen99 Yes and they're all on the coast.
[1:09:13] <Prevot> @skeletonmanners one of the most9st infuriating aspects of metroidvanias
[1:09:52] <+Piemen99> so that's it
[1:09:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> It's just that the center of the continent is where god hangs out so there's no way to get there by land unless you're a platforming beast.
[1:09:54] <Mendin> Beat the Lords of the Underworld, get a very Underworld-y color scheme, seems good
[1:10:08] <jase__x> yeah another 2 or 3 sessions
[1:10:17] <ManlyMcBeefington> Ren's 4th color?
[1:10:21] <FuqBoiSlim> Shredder Qadira PogChamp
[1:10:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> @woolieversus You're fine
[1:10:37] <Mendin> the Point of No Return is significantly far away
[1:11:03] <+Matt_Made> Yeah its super far. It goes yo you aint coming back if you go this way
[1:11:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> God will tell you when when you're at the point of no return.
[1:11:27] <%ChoculaUltra> now there are 2 of them!
[1:12:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> "Straaaaand"
[1:13:13] <BreakersAweigh> to be honest, its this part of the game that soured an otherwise good experience playing indivisible. traversing in between zones felt like a chore the longer i played.
[1:13:13] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:13:56] <+austinlamode> woooolz!
[1:13:57] <%ChoculaUltra> is there really like no fast travel portals like in SotN?
[1:14:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> @breakersaweigh It felt relaxing to me. Especially that by this point you have so many mulligans if you miss a jump.
[1:14:06] <+austinlamode> austin71Stopjosuke austin71Stopjosuke austin71Stopjosuke austin71Stopjosuke
[1:14:17] <Mendin> There's a fast travel hub in each area but it's usually at One End of it
[1:14:24] <%ChoculaUltra> ah I see
[1:14:25] <Mendin> So you gotta hoof it to the other end, in this case
[1:14:26] <BreakersAweigh> i wish there was an easier way to traverse. rather than more platforming options
[1:14:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> A posing for powe
[1:14:58] <BreakersAweigh> or at least checkpoints to jump between
[1:15:06] <+Matt_Made> Yeah a fast travel would be fantastic
[1:15:08] <%gatorafan> her souls left body long ago
[1:15:16] <Mendin> come on femwoolie

[1:21:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> @gatorafan Ooph
[1:21:54] <Fujiwara_92> happy go lucky with occasional genocide
[1:22:00] <jase__x> dhar = dust
[1:22:18] <ThunderSaad> Probably that'd end up making a more sensical story for a saturday morning cartoon.
[1:22:27] <bigbrothergannon> correction Inuyasha

[1:24:16] <%ozzrabbit> Doesn‚Äôt he still have a few more quests to finish?
[1:24:23] <Mendin> There are missions in the bottom/low/low-mid parts of Sumeru. The endgame is at the TOP

[1:28:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> That is probably one of the best written scene in the game.
[1:28:20] <%redrins> unlike a certain ajna
[1:29:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> @woolieversus There's a pad between the quest and the end.
[1:29:24] <Ashenik1> If I am correct Hitler was hidnig one jew ecasue it was his cousin so one good act I guess
[1:30:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> Dhar, I don't miss you, but I miss your movelist.

[1:48:27] <Graxe_> Before the chiral network and the internet, there were fungal networks
[1:48:41] <ManlyMcBeefington> did woolie get the part to go to the desert for latigos?
[1:48:51] <Haarute> remember when woolie thought we'd get all of this done this stream with time to spare for the main plot

[1:51:30] <+tankusmaximus7> Which also means Woolie should remember to peep them colors after a few side stories.
[1:51:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> @tankusmaximus7 He does after each subquest
[1:51:52] <%gatorafan> I mean, might as well call it Quest Mountain since the main story also happens there.
[1:52:12] <SiegeJay> ITs funny how Ajna's mom's axe is now reduced to jump correction in endgame

[2:01:02] <%gatorafan> @qaizerart I no rite? I've seen some stuff while catching up to both LPs and they do a good job
[2:01:10] <+Matt_Made> @ChoculaUltra Thats messed up.
[2:01:16] <Haarute> kinda.
[2:01:19] <Samuraiflame> boat is goat
[2:01:25] <KitsuneManami> @SiegeJay just saw, what a shitty cutscene LOL
[2:01:34] <%ozzrabbit> Yes
[2:01:40] <jase__x> dhar falling into the redemption but die first category
[2:01:49] <KitsuneManami> @SiegeJay hope Ajna is never liked by anyone she got killed lol
[2:02:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> I mean, still one of the best written scenes in the game.
[2:02:23] <jase__x> Ajna is Naruto
[2:02:31] <powerprotoman> hahaa nice joke woolie
[2:02:34] <KitsuneManami> Thats a understatement
[2:02:49] <+paladinstarbuster> she's doing A job
[2:02:54] <KitsuneManami> Dhar never got a chance to Try besides DIE
[2:02:55] <KitsuneManami> lol
[2:03:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> But it takes so long though, Woolie. Redemption is such a hassle.
[2:03:18] <GVGguy> Ah yes, confusions with quest markers in this place...
[2:03:34] <powerprotoman> imagine using side content to try and push a redemption arc
[2:03:35] <KitsuneManami> Yeaaa i heard about the awkward progress story stuff
[2:03:55] <GVGguy> Side quests in the Iron Kingdom are a fucking mess.
[2:03:56] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1210124488463077376
[2:03:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie just keep going, it is in the slums.
[2:04:22] <%QaizerArt> the fact these two aren't party members sucks
[2:04:42] <SiegeJay> Mary looks like if you fucked her your dick would get crushed by moving gears
[2:05:01] <Superbro64> mary is reminiscent of that one soul calibur 4 guest character
[2:05:09] <jase__x> jesus
[2:05:12] <Superbro64> made by a guest character artist? I forget her name
[2:05:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> ALL ACCORDING TO KAIKAKU
[2:05:33] <KamiiFlow> angol fear or ashebel
[2:05:50] <Superbro64> definitely not angol fear, probably the later
[2:05:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> KAIKAKU
[2:06:09] <SiegeJay> ALL A CORDIAN! TO KEI KA KU!
[2:06:16] <Haarute> @WoolieVersus if it helps a little, party members will tell you where to go if you talk to them in the inner realm
[2:06:16] <GVGguy> You uh, you might want to talk to some of the NPCs here
[2:06:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> @haarute This is so much fun tho
[2:06:46] <thunderhog> For the record, a NPC is important if they're not in the background but in the foreground
[2:06:48] <SiegeJay> See a cool girl on the roof tops
[2:06:51] <%gatorafan> I can't believe Woolie mastercrafted this speedrunning sidequests route
[2:07:02] <KamiiFlow> yo it was ashelotte @Superbro64
[2:07:06] <SiegeJay> THANK YOU REGGIE
[2:07:17] <thunderhog> It's how you can tell the difference between NPCs and Backer NPCS
[2:07:32] <Superbro64> fun fact, angol fear, a character created specifically for SC4, is canon to the Sgt. Frog universe, as the guest artist was the mangaka I think for that series
[2:07:37] <SiegeJay> Thats a lot of health
[2:07:39] <Superbro64> SoulCal is weird
[2:07:50] <Mendin> A lot of health. Real tank, that is
[2:08:01] <SiegeJay> @Superbro64 Sgt. Frog still going?
[2:08:05] <KitsuneManami> @WoolieVersus REGGIE, are you guys gonna be playing Soul Calibur 6 again? Hilde is out and new Gameplay updates
[2:08:11] <Haarute> i think it's because enemies here are armored so you should use magic damage but woolie is rocking exclusive physical damage.
[2:08:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> BTW, you can charge fuck these guys in the overworld for 15 seconds and they'll melt.
[2:08:14] <Superbro64> your guess is as good as mine
[2:08:20] <+Matt_Made> Tanks a beefcake
[2:08:30] <SiegeJay> @Superbro64 Mom is best milf
[2:08:36] <Superbro64> @kamiiflow thanks for fact checking
[2:09:12] <Superbro64> that looks more train and less tank to me
[2:09:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> Charge run into them for 10-15 seconds in the overworld and they melt
[2:09:25] <KitsuneManami> Soul Calibur 6 When? Hilde is out or waiting on Crossover?
[2:09:49] <BearSawed> @KitsuneManami I dont know if theyll notice ya, they dont want to ackowlage chat when in lp mode <3
[2:09:55] <jase__x> if crossplay ever happens
[2:10:05] <ManlyMcBeefington> inner realm?
[2:10:14] <SiegeJay> IS THAT HIM>?\
[2:10:18] <Superbro64> soul calibur 6 cassandra and soul calibur 4 cassandra are two different characters that simultaneously exist, apparently
[2:10:22] <KitsuneManami> @BearSawed Figured, i'll wait later
[2:10:22] <SiegeJay> Was that really Plague?
[2:10:23] <Superbro64> soulcal is WEIRD
[2:10:24] <%ChoculaUltra> was that the gripes
[2:10:47] <SiegeJay> Is Woolie in this game?
[2:11:06] <KitsuneManami> Baz is , so yes
[2:11:07] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:11:17] <SiegeJay> If Plague is in this game, is Woolie, Liam, Pat, or Matt?
[2:11:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> @bearsawed They won't explicitly say it, but the timing shows that they are looking at the chat occasionally.
[2:11:34] <SiegeJay> How about Cranky Construct?
[2:12:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> The other sidequest is in the factory.
[2:12:27] <SiegeJay> More likely, Zone-tan is somewhere in this game..
[2:12:36] <thunderhog> Which quest is this for?
[2:12:39] <%QaizerArt> @BearSawed They 100% are acknowledging chat, at least when they are unsure about something. When Woolie said Iron Kingdom a few times, it was cause of everyone saying it
[2:12:47] <+balouie> find qadiras brother
[2:12:58] <ManlyMcBeefington> @thunderhog bhozai
[2:13:05] <+Matt_Made> That game fluff
[2:13:07] <%QaizerArt> They are just really good at smoothly transitioning chat info into recording
[2:13:13] <thunderhog> If it's Baozai, i'll say it's towards the end of the factory where you faught slime queen
[2:13:17] <thunderhog> Just not on the roof
[2:13:19] <BearSawed> @QaizerArt Yeah, but bro was just asking an unrelated question
[2:13:21] <+balouie> I think there are new npcs in the iron kingdom who eventually lead to her brother
[2:13:29] <%QaizerArt> ah
[2:13:43] <Superbro64> They got that sajam segue tech
[2:13:54] <Mendin> I think the lore hint was to ask around in the slums
[2:14:02] <%QaizerArt> Yeah sorry I didn't mean to seem like I was mad or anything, just telling ya, though I misinterpreted. My bad.
[2:14:25] <thunderhog> It's in that Unfilled yellow area in the factory thats reachin to the purple
[2:14:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> Do the other quest, with the robit
[2:14:35] <BearSawed> @QaizerArt Nah, my dude I get it. Its all good <3
[2:17:20] <thunderhog> What you're looking for is in that undiscovered part in the yellow towards the top of the map thats reaching towards the purple
[2:18:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> ALLL THE WAY BACK
[2:18:10] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:18:17] <%JetpackMcQuack> I like how reggie corrected that to might be :)
[2:18:25] <thunderhog> I honestly dont know why Mike Z didn't put markers on ALL the quests
[2:18:33] <%gatorafan> because small indie Dev?
[2:18:35] <+chesterr01> trying lol @jetpackmcquack
[2:18:45] <%gatorafan> I dunno, is that intentional or a bug?
[2:18:50] <%gatorafan> looks like a bug
[2:18:54] <thunderhog> Oh i mean i know but Mike Z's been godlike on most of it
[2:19:01] <BearSawed> Maybe a time constraint, or oversight. Its hard t tell without word from the devs
[2:19:02] <thunderhog> It's just weird how inconsistant it is
[2:19:22] <thunderhog> but hopefully this is something mike can work on or at least adress
[2:20:42] <Saltmeisterr> ah this dude gonna die
[2:20:47] <Saltmeisterr> fast
[2:20:49] <thunderhog> BODDIED lytALRIGHT
[2:20:55] <BearSawed> What a BIIIIItchhhhh
[2:21:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> Well
[2:21:05] <%gatorafan> add one more to Anna's bodycount Kappa
[2:21:13] <%gatorafan> dammit phone
[2:21:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> "M'lady"
[2:21:40] <thunderhog> Ocean of milk is where you found Thornai that one time.
[2:21:47] <BearSawed> Woolie:I talk for a living
[2:21:50] <thunderhog> Under the Tai krung chakra gate
[2:21:51] <+balouie> tai krung
[2:21:52] <Haarute> tai krung teleporter and go down
[2:21:59] <%JetpackMcQuack> That's a lotta milk
[2:22:14] <BearSawed> Thats alot of fish
[2:22:45] <Darkdrill> the ocean of milk sounds like a pervy nickname for a mother
[2:22:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> The kayfabe, Reggie playing the kayfabe strong
[2:23:09] <BearSawed> You learn alot about people from what they say
[2:23:12] <%gatorafan> Gotta respect that
[2:23:23] <COMB711> Bring Mommy to the milk
[2:23:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> @comb711 stawp
[2:23:39] <thunderhog> The ocean of milk is a hindu thing. It's basicly the sea of life
[2:23:41] <+balouie> pink part
[2:23:46] <@Menitta> man the map gets big
[2:23:47] <TheWashoutXY> MrDestructoid Douse me in milk Woolie
[2:24:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> AAAAGG
[2:24:07] <BearSawed> Is this the birth of a new Reggie fetish?
[2:24:08] <thunderhog> @WoolieVersus ocean of milk is the pink area at the bottom of the map
[2:24:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pink bottom right of the map
[2:25:28] <thunderhog> Normally I don't backseat this much, but god damn no checkmarks and trying to figure out where to go is some shit
[2:25:28] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1210124488463077376
[2:25:48] <%gatorafan> Can't Thorani feel the thirst?
[2:25:51] <thunderhog> Also gay drinking time PrideSaba
[2:26:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> Ajna still doesn't understand the gay energy.
[2:26:18] <%JetpackMcQuack> above the belt while in my head
[2:26:26] <thunderhog> For the record, you can super make that fist jump if you're crazy, but not the second one across
[2:26:32] <thunderhog> not worth it
[2:26:54] <ManlyMcBeefington> Latigo
[2:26:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> @jetpackmcquack If she can't stop mushrooms from growing in her head...
[2:27:02] <ManlyMcBeefington> the 6th bullet
[2:27:30] <twilightbreaker> Ello there Woolie!
[2:27:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> Desert
[2:27:50] <+balouie> yeah I hated this part of the game trying to figure out sidquests
[2:27:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> Latigo in the desert
[2:27:59] <%ozzrabbit> Remind me, did they get Razmi‚Äôs quest already?
[2:28:25] <+balouie> latigo is in the first part of the desert with the blowing winds
[2:28:30] <%gatorafan> is he actually called Latigo? Or is he supposed to be L√°tigo but people can't spell it in game because English? daedra1DerpyTibs
[2:28:43] <thunderhog> Did they get to Sumeru already? cause im pretty sure Razimi's finishes off in sumeru
[2:28:47] <Haarute> it is.
[2:28:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> Not yet
[2:28:54] <thunderhog> Super is on spotifiy
[2:28:58] <BearSawed> This feels like game design from before the internet, like secrets/obscure things to keep you finding new things. Pain in the ass then, pain in the ass now
[2:29:01] <@Menitta> Theres a good chunk on Spotify
[2:29:13] <Classicgamer323> is this still going on YouTube?
[2:29:15] <thunderhog> Also backers got the soundtrack for download as well
[2:29:23] <%gatorafan> @classicgamer323 ye
[2:29:35] <Classicgamer323> @gatorafan thank you
[2:29:41] <+KinnikuDash> Skullgirls and Cuphead's soundtracks have been on Spotify for a while now
[2:29:52] <@Menitta> Oh yeah Indivisible is on Spotify
[2:29:55] <+Matt_Made> Word?
[2:30:10] <+tankusmaximus7> Indivisible‚Äôs been on Spotify since Oct 7th
[2:30:14] <thunderhog> Nah it's just her blue demon form thing
[2:30:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> Spooooiler cover?
[2:30:39] <thunderhog> I mean it's a spoiler for like the first part of the game
[2:30:47] <thunderhog> not to anyone who's watched this far
[2:30:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> @woolieversus Charge rush into it and it'll melt.
[2:30:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> 10-15 seconds straight
[2:31:07] <+Bearzone> full sprint into tank
[2:31:22] <+balouie> full sprint into the tank and you can finish it
[2:31:22] <+Bearzone> no it wont you will damage it
[2:31:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> No
[2:31:28] <BearSawed> Lies! Lies!
[2:31:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> Run sprint
[2:31:32] <+balouie> from behind
[2:31:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> Not airdash you fool
[2:31:45] <PunishedRaccoon> run sprint will just dmg it
[2:31:45] <Haarute> when the game came out you could run into it and melt it without a fight but it was patched out i think
[2:31:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> Did they patch it out?
[2:31:48] <+Bearzone> no do the run and dont let go
[2:31:50] <PunishedRaccoon> i bet 100 subs
[2:31:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> Never stop running
[2:31:55] <thunderhog> @WoolieVersus Also if you wanna tell the difference between backer NPCs and normal ones, backer npcs are always in the background, normal ones are pushed a bit towards the foreground
[2:32:09] <SiegeJay> sf meme lies etc
[2:32:13] <BearSawed> Bold strategy Raccoon, Lets see if it pays off
[2:32:18] <StarlitStunner> spyTea spyCappa
[2:32:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> They MAY have patched it out, I beat the game when it first came out
[2:32:43] <+Matt_Made> You used to be able to run through them
[2:32:43] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:32:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> Old truths become new lies

[2:36:54] <+ConLin_Arts_> woolieMIRIN
[2:37:05] <GVGguy> Wait, I thought they patched that
[2:37:32] <Haarute> do you need to talk to someone first to trigger him into existence?
[2:38:31] <+Bearzone> did yall talk to the girl on the roof about info about the brother?
[2:38:40] <%gatorafan> ye
[2:38:43] <thunderhog> Theres some other npcs you need to talk to here in the iron kingdom
[2:38:46] <+MrRabbles> that was felicity
[2:39:14] <BearSawed> error 404 flag not found?
[2:39:38] <thunderhog> Mike Z i love you but god damn the side questings some shit
[2:39:44] <+balouie> iron kingdom area right by the docks one npc is near the castle and last one is the slums the current area you are in
[2:39:44] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:39:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> THIS is old school game design, brother does not exist until Flag triggered.
[2:40:01] <%gatorafan> Remember when we thought we could get this wrapped up quick? Good times. Keepo
[2:40:20] <Samuraiflame> you did that tho
[2:40:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> YOU DID
[2:40:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> That is Felicity
[2:40:28] <+MrRabbles> felicity was the informant
[2:40:34] <zayasu> dunkey giving shoutouts to ikaruga in his new video Kreygasm
[2:40:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> you did...
[2:40:42] <Samuraiflame> you did it already BibleThump
[2:40:44] <Haarute> YOU DID.
[2:40:46] <%gatorafan> you talked to Felicity
[2:40:50] <+Bearzone> been did
[2:41:01] <+Matt_Made> That was done
[2:41:02] <%gatorafan> that's when you got the prompt to go to Iron Kingdom
[2:41:03] <powerprotoman> classic woolie memory if it happened in the past it didnt really happen as you think it did
[2:41:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> You did the second time
[2:41:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> yes
[2:41:16] <+Bearzone> on your way out
[2:41:19] <%mistspade> @WoolieVersus there's a dude with white hair near the docks you need to talk to you sre missing a step the guide doesn't have it
[2:41:23] <thunderhog> She told you to meet someone here in iron kingdom
[2:41:27] <+Bearzone> talk to every npc going to the docs
[2:41:29] <Helix_Snake> oh god they're remaking the grudge fucking why
[2:41:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> Go to old lady NPC near docks
[2:41:35] <+MrRabbles> accidently walked into Kampan LUL
[2:41:40] <+balouie> this is kampans quest
[2:41:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> KAIKAKU
[2:41:43] <%gatorafan> CALCULATED
[2:41:46] <BearSawed> Call mike right now
[2:42:04] <powerprotoman> woolie the answer to your problem is "Just talk"
[2:42:18] <Helix_Snake> that guy has cheesesteaks, nothing on earth makes a bag that greasy except cheesesteaks
[2:42:19] <%gatorafan> Hijinks music SourPls
[2:42:31] <%JetpackMcQuack> whipV
[2:42:32] <BearSawed> hit him up for some quest markers
[2:42:48] <thunderhog> Literally a body bag
[2:42:52] <+Dangerlocker> monkaS
[2:42:57] <blazbishop> what's up. fan of your streams woolie. I started playing indivisible for a few days now it's really good.
[2:43:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> Quest complete
[2:43:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> Kidding
[2:43:07] <+MrRabbles> what's in the booooooooox
[2:43:11] <muniea3> it's a bunch of those penis fish
[2:43:29] <+MrRabbles> it just works
[2:43:43] <thunderhog> @WoolieVersus You can tell it's an important NPC is they're in the middle of the road and not the background
[2:43:58] <Helix_Snake> statistically at least one of these people is taking the money straight to the casino
[2:44:06] <+MrRabbles> trickle down economics as done by Kampan
[2:44:16] <%xdeathknightx> when you come back later you see him there with a ton of women and drugs
[2:44:17] <turqrazor> this game would be a lot better if ajna wasn't such a brat
[2:44:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> Haaaaa
[2:44:48] <Haarute> the game does a lot of things it doesn't tell you about.
[2:44:58] <thunderhog> Yeah really silly. Only noticed it after going though this same shit woolie
[2:45:11] <thunderhog> Least I can do is save you the headache
[2:45:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> Now go back to the part of town you were just in, flag has now been triggered so they exist now.
[2:46:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> Punished Reggie is emerging.
[2:46:51] <Helix_Snake> HRWAAH
[2:46:52] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1210124488463077376
[2:46:53] <thunderhog> Again, real silly that THAT NPC gets a quest marker, but all the other ones dont half the time
[2:47:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> I think the idea is that since you were explicitly told a spot so it's pointed out on the map, but it is unclear.
[2:48:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> Flag triggered, onichan exists now.
[2:48:34] <thunderhog> Like i can understand not directly pointing out a location for a thing if it's supposed to be a secret or just "something you need to figure on your own", but some of these things is little silly
[2:48:39] <Haarute> head to where you were earlier with the tank
[2:49:31] <Helix_Snake> this section of the game feels like "why I don't play RPGs"
[2:49:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> I adore this Kayfabe Woolie and Reggie have put up to split Twitch and YouTube.
[2:49:49] <%JetpackMcQuack> Green scarf clan?
[2:49:51] <+MrRabbles> they look so alike
[2:50:00] <%xdeathknightx> Brother was too busy getting busy
[2:50:04] <jase__x> fucking ooops
[2:50:25] <muniea3> but he just said he thought you were dead..
[2:50:28] <%gatorafan> You mean I murdered all those people in my revenge quest for nothing? Kappa
[2:50:43] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @thunderhog
[2:50:54] <Helix_Snake> why is he purple and green at the same time
[2:50:56] <thunderhog> Iron kingdom soliders just murdered like that
[2:51:16] <%QaizerArt> this seems like, the most anti-climatic ending
[2:51:27] <thunderhog> 410,757,864,530 Dead Iron Kingdom Soldiers
[2:52:08] <%gatorafan> and the tank just watched the whole thing
[2:52:08] <+MrRabbles> but was the color worth it
[2:52:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> You have to be persistent you see.
[2:53:07] <thunderhog> Ginseng gets Naga Rider colors
[2:53:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> Armless McGee at the Dance Club
[2:53:40] <+balouie> dont characters also get higher stats from completing these quests
[2:53:42] <powerprotoman> tai krung for yans shizz
[2:54:12] <thunderhog> @WoolieVersus before you go back, theres a pocket area to the left if you wanna finish off Kanpans quest
[2:54:12] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:54:17] <ManlyMcBeefington> talk to Latigo, see if you can go do all the desert quest
[2:55:46] <thunderhog> Also real talk, i feel like these tanks just exist to be combo ajucators
[2:56:19] <Helix_Snake> what if there was a game like this but the combos were as technical as a traditional fighting game with stuff like hitstun degradation
[2:57:24] <Superbro64> so you want namco x capcom, or project x zone, but with actually engaging gameplay?
[2:57:27] <thunderhog> What, so like a turn based RPG where you do a full combo, but when you drop it its their turn?
[2:57:28] <Superbro64> not happening Kappa
[2:57:35] <Helix_Snake> thunderhog yes
[2:57:52] <thunderhog> So an honorable fighting game then with gentemans agreements
[2:57:52] <+chesterr01> where's the kanpan hobo
[2:57:58] <+MrRabbles> truly the curse was us all along
[2:58:00] <thunderhog> as opposed to going full MVC infinites
[2:58:11] <Superbro64> whoever were the devs that made namco x capcom, they actually made a game thats that, if I recall correctly
[2:58:29] <thunderhog> other than Project X zone?
[2:58:29] <Superbro64> forget the name, had crossover character too, I remember
[2:58:41] <Superbro64> ps2 or psp game, I forget
[2:58:49] <thunderhog> I mean they're all just super robot wars
[2:58:52] <+chesterr01> hey chat, where is the last kanpan hobo?
[2:59:02] <Superbro64> give me a second to fact check
[2:59:07] <thunderhog> It's literally to the left here
[2:59:15] <thunderhog> Hard left
[2:59:18] <ManlyMcBeefington> I guess by the docks (just a guess)
[2:59:24] <+chesterr01> ughhhhh
[2:59:46] <thunderhog> Theres a little area you have to corkscrew into
[3:00:06] <thunderhog> Yeah we good reg
[3:00:11] <%CommanderSqueaks> Holy shit
[3:00:24] <thunderhog> Man, how tf do you eat money?
[3:00:26] <zayasu> that voice cirWut
[3:00:30] <ManlyMcBeefington> also since we got someone's attention check if you are going to the desert fornlatigo or if you gotta rush back to kanuul
[3:00:44] <Helix_Snake> money can be exchanged for goods and services!
[3:00:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> You changed the costume so this joke is fucjed
[3:01:02] <Superbro64> the game I was talking about is called Cross Edge
[3:01:05] <thunderhog> Goooooold! lytBACKOFF
[3:01:13] <KamiiFlow> i love goooold
[3:01:13] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:01:17] <Superbro64> from looking at it, it doesnt seem to have what you want, but thats a thing
[3:01:25] <+MrRabbles> Kampan denied
[3:01:32] <Haarute> that's the sound of a man who's done.
[3:01:34] <thunderhog> I cant belive kanpan got tossed in the garbage
[3:01:38] <%gatorafan> Mmmmmmmmmeeeeeee - Kampan
[3:01:53] <Superbro64> has the crossover capcom characters too. So there are apparently 3 different series of these games or something. Weird
[3:02:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> Dance Room
[3:02:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> Armless girl
[3:02:27] <ManlyMcBeefington> @chesterr01 talk to Latigo to see if you can go to the desert.
[3:02:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> Desert for shooty revolver man too.
[3:02:38] <%ozzrabbit> Latigo in the desert
[3:02:40] <Haarute> we get to walk past baz again.
[3:02:43] <thunderhog> @Superbro64 Oh man CROSS EDGE?! I try to remove that game from my mind. Only know that game cause it has Ar Tonelico in it
[3:02:51] <Superbro64> yup yup
[3:02:57] <thunderhog> and dark stalkers too i guess
[3:02:58] <Superbro64> looks very ar tone
[3:03:00] <+klholland92> Easily the most tedious part of the game
[3:03:14] <thunderhog> It literally has the cast of AT1 man
[3:03:32] <Superbro64> question: are we all assuming lab zero does SG2 next, or something else?
[3:03:44] <Superbro64> is dlc planned beyond the guest characters?
[3:03:54] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh, he didn't do that part yet, woops
[3:04:03] <ranarath> Oo, I actually get to catch a Woolie stream. Cool.
[3:04:04] <%QaizerArt> Okay, so this area's music, am I the only one noticing it sounds like Wall Market?
[3:04:05] <%mistspade> @WoolieVersus you can't finish his yet
[3:04:10] <%QaizerArt> From FF7?
[3:04:21] <Haarute> ! brain at risk !
[3:04:23] <+MrRabbles> it totally does @QaizerArt
[3:04:31] <+MrRabbles> i've had it in my head this entire time
[3:04:40] <%QaizerArt> Like, it's got the same beat even.
[3:04:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> woolieTRASH woolieDATTEBAYO woolieTRASH
[3:05:00] <%QaizerArt> Just a little bit funkier.
[3:05:18] <Superbro64> we stuck in this game's izanami chat NotLikeThis
[3:05:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> She's making the slave pit her own.
[3:05:26] <Superbro64> it wants us to confess our sins
[3:05:40] <+MrRabbles> Infinite SideQuestyomi
[3:05:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> Infinite Sidequestworks
[3:06:16] <Haarute> there's too many party members.
[3:06:42] <thunderhog> Dude It took me two sessions to do all the side quests. not to mention you still got all the shit in Sumeru which I assume you're doing like me and avoiding until everything else
[3:06:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> Someone more ambitious than me, take Infinite Bladeworks soliloquy and make it about Sidequests
[3:06:53] <Superbro64> I assume the reward for these side quests are worth it, other then the color palette change
[3:07:15] <Haarute> yay razmi is in again.
[3:07:18] <MarshMan301> bruh, nice combo
[3:07:27] <Haarute> razmi down attack into lvl 3 is the shit.

[3:09:05] <Haarute> LOOK AT SHANG TSUNG OVER HERE.
[3:09:06] <thunderhog> AND YOU NEVER WILL
[3:09:08] <GVGguy> I never got to see that
[3:09:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> @gvgguy Yeah that's patched in
[3:09:23] <MarshMan301> wait is she armless or just have them folded in like Oru?
[3:09:24] <GVGguy> Oh what theffffffffffffff
[3:09:34] <thunderhog> She's literally armless

[3:09:43] <thunderhog> Who needs arms with leggs like these lytOHYES
[3:09:46] <Superbro64> shang tsung???
[3:09:50] <+MrRabbles> Yan's mom must be were the height comes from
[3:09:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> Actually Pops
[3:09:53] <CursedNobleman> LEGS.
[3:09:55] <KamiiFlow> the arms went straight to her legs
[3:09:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> Literally Pops
[3:09:58] <Haarute> it's literally shang tsung.
[3:10:24] <SiegeJay> Shang Tsung does not have that beard mustash combo
[3:10:42] <SiegeJay> Master PAin from Kung Pow
[3:10:48] <thunderhog> NAH you dont get no bird kick
[3:10:55] <thunderhog> That'd be a cool reward
[3:11:14] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> Shang Tsung look and Ajna and be like "Damn, I wish I could take souls that good"
[3:11:23] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> at*
[3:11:23] <+MrRabbles> a chunners
[3:11:28] <thunderhog> I belive if you're leaving Sumeru for last, you only got Latigo to go
[3:11:34] <powerprotoman> shame about the mvoe never happening
[3:11:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> Kanul
[3:11:53] <SiegeJay> Kumg Pow has become an old movie a this point...
[3:11:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> They lies
[3:12:04] <thunderhog> LEGIT lies
[3:12:06] <Haarute> one guy no jutsu strikes again
[3:12:07] <SiegeJay> I pity this chat will never know Kung Pow
[3:12:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> ONE GUY
[3:12:12] <thunderhog> ONE GUY
[3:12:14] <+enickma11> No its available
[3:12:17] <GVGguy> So wait, the spinning bird kick is not even a super?
[3:12:20] <+balouie> you should be able to do latigos
[3:12:23] <thunderhog> I did Latigo before Sumeru, you good woolie
[3:12:28] <thunderhog> It's the One Guy curse
[3:12:42] <Haarute> @SiegeJay i implore you to reconsider.
[3:12:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> @gvgguy That dance was patched in, so chances are it'll be a move in a later patch.
[3:12:54] <Superbro64> coding is hard woolie Kappa
[3:13:01] <GVGguy> Greeeaaaaaat
[3:13:02] <+MrRabbles> map why have you forsaken us BibleThump
[3:13:12] <thunderhog> @WoolieVersus It's in the city around the stadium area
[3:13:12] <powerprotoman> why would you want to see things on a map? mike z 2019
[3:13:19] <thunderhog> It's legit just a cowboy dude
[3:13:23] <GVGguy> Another reason to recommend my friends to wait with getting this game
[3:13:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> It's the guy who looks like a cowboy
[3:13:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> In the main area with everyone else
[3:13:51] <SiegeJay> @Haarute Then how does he look like Shang Tsung when he has a mustashe?
[3:14:20] <SiegeJay> Only old full robe Shang had a mustashe in most cases
[3:16:10] <+MrRabbles> does look like the dark souls pyromancer robes kinda
[3:16:10] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:16:54] <thunderhog> I actually forgot, you cant see his damn hat cause he's HOLDING IT. It's in the dude in the house
[3:17:10] <TheWashoutXY> Still on the sidequest grind?
[3:17:15] <thunderhog> Oh wait no its this dude
[3:17:18] <thunderhog> im tired man
[3:18:07] <PunishedRaccoon> this is the best quest
[3:18:22] <thunderhog> Also did you do Nuna's whole quest?
[3:18:36] <powerprotoman> yes woolie teleporting here every time was infact making this longer
[3:19:09] <Haarute> check menu for stars.
[3:19:52] <%gatorafan> Woolie has done Nuna's quest
[3:19:54] <+balouie> I know razmi zebel kushi and the dog require sumeru cant remember the other
[3:20:33] <Superbro64> what does 1.2 do?
[3:20:43] <thunderhog> Indivisible super turbo edition
[3:20:50] <GVGguy> Nope
[3:21:00] <thunderhog> NAH Woolz, I went through this too
[3:21:04] <+balouie> I also did them in the end it was annoying
[3:21:19] <thunderhog> Everything unlocks when you redo all 3 areas, so most people just do the same shit
[3:21:22] <GVGguy> Most of these sidequests don't unlock unlock until you've beaten the story-parts they take place in.
[3:21:31] <thunderhog> WOAH
[3:21:52] <thunderhog> THANKS LATIGO
[3:21:53] <Haarute> LMAO yeah
[3:21:54] <GVGguy> MHM
[3:21:59] <+balouie> this is easier from the ashwat side
[3:22:05] <Superbro64> maybe the sidequests could be better paced? Since it might be natural to start sidequesting once you get all the mobility upgrades
[3:22:07] <jase__x> fuuuuuuuuck
[3:22:08] <Superbro64> I dunno
[3:22:27] <GVGguy> Who know the fastest path would actually be through Ashwatt
[3:22:47] <+balouie> I found that out the hard way
[3:22:48] <GVGguy> If only this game had a way to see a map of the whole game world.
[3:22:48] <thunderhog> Yeah most people dont think to go to ashwat to go into the desert
[3:22:51] <GVGguy> Like Metroid.
[3:23:02] <jase__x> This game continues to make me feel like not all games need sidequests
[3:23:02] <thunderhog> "dont break wind" words to live by
[3:23:10] <GVGguy> Or Castlevania
[3:23:11] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:23:13] <+MrRabbles> side quests will continue until morale improves
[3:23:48] <thunderhog> "Now im saving this 6th bullet for KALA". Yo i swear
[3:24:23] <GVGguy> Oh, right, saving Latigo for last is... a fun choice
[3:24:29] <Superbro64> I assume that preferably, main quest, side quests, challenging gameplay, and character upgrades, should all happen in succesion, or tandem with each other
[3:24:30] <+MrRabbles> all the tank fights have been leading up to this moment
[3:24:40] <jase__x> not
[3:24:45] <Superbro64> too much or too little of one of the other may lead to poor pacing
[3:25:21] <GVGguy> We can't animate a side quest-boss that started off as one of the characters we pitched as a party member when we first started the indeigogo, right?
[3:25:22] <+balouie> all the sidequest bosses are really easy
[3:25:25] <Superbro64> side quest grinding gives me ptsd of my mmo phase NotLikeThis
[3:25:29] <+balouie> except the cat one
[3:25:49] <jase__x> Holy shit
[3:25:49] <CrazyMedicine> PogChamp
[3:25:51] <Haarute> D E S T R O Y E D
[3:25:51] <thunderhog> GOD DAMN
[3:25:51] <KamiiFlow> that was dope
[3:25:55] <+MrRabbles> that tank was nothing compared to the others
[3:25:59] <thunderhog> WHO NEEDS THAT 6TH BULLET
[3:26:00] <SiegeJay> YOOOOOOO
[3:26:02] <jase__x> These fights are so trivial
[3:26:04] <GVGguy> Oh hey look, there he is, just like he looked in the indeigogo-pitch
[3:26:04] <%gatorafan> Hey, it's that old design
[3:26:08] <SiegeJay> Its the original design!!
[3:26:44] <KamiiFlow> he shot his old design?
[3:26:54] <KamiiFlow> LUL
[3:26:55] <SiegeJay> Original design*
[3:27:00] <GVGguy> More than his old design, his old concept
[3:27:03] <jase__x> KILL THE PAST
[3:27:19] <GVGguy> The old design was named Vasco
[3:27:20] <Superbro64> the "this is too cash money for us to animate" design
[3:27:22] <thunderhog> I still gotta play Silver Case
[3:27:23] <Superbro64> as you do
[3:27:25] <+MrRabbles> rival awoke to justive
[3:27:43] <Superbro64> spend your limited budget and resources wisely kids
[3:28:53] <thunderhog> Color 4 is at least the vasco color
[3:28:56] <SiegeJay> New color is is original color design
[3:29:35] <Haarute> all sumeru i think
[3:29:38] <+MrRabbles> that Dhar spot
[3:29:40] <+balouie> yeah they all require sumaru
[3:29:40] <jase__x> how are you gonna save best girl for last
[3:29:42] <thunderhog> Yep All sumeru
[3:29:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> rip Dhar
[3:29:48] <Haarute> razmi was top left sumeru
[3:29:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yes
[3:29:55] <Lagseene> woolieCHAN
[3:29:59] <thunderhog> Raz was "we need to go to Sumeru to deal with the demon in the lamp"
[3:30:00] <+balouie> you have to do a small part for the dog before you can do the sumeru
[3:30:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> !uptime
[3:30:11] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 30 minutes

[3:31:03] <Superbro64> at least we arent naruto overworld griding LUL @woolieversus
[3:31:05] <thunderhog> DONT blame you man
[3:31:16] <Superbro64> naruto overworld stuff can be rough man
[3:31:18] <ranarath> !uptime
[3:31:18] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 31 minutes
[3:31:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> Persistenceeeee, no this part is rough
[3:31:59] <+balouie> its like old ultima game design
[3:32:09] <+balouie> also no escape from battles
[3:32:34] <Superbro64> aint an rpg without that one tedious grind session
[3:32:39] <thunderhog> Dude I went though it all the same man. It's a big bummer before the fucking ending stretch
[3:32:39] <+blewbeary> Sprinting grunts*
[3:32:42] <Superbro64> even thousand year door has that one chapter
[3:32:44] <jase__x> Woolie is finally feeling it
[3:32:58] <powerprotoman> the optimal route is what yuo did
[3:33:11] <straydog505> !uptime
[3:33:11] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 33 minutes
[3:33:22] <$punkthepsychopenguin> Oh sweet, Woolie isn't wearing shower curtains today.
[3:33:22] <ManlyMcBeefington> that was not optimal
[3:33:36] <Superbro64> 100% speedrunners of rpg games are literally insane people @woolieversus
[3:33:40] <thunderhog> Yeah, this isn't a you tuing
[3:33:41] <Superbro64> they are not human
[3:33:57] <+balouie> there is also one cat sidequest that isnt really shown how to do
[3:34:03] <jase__x> None of these sidequest
[3:34:07] <jase__x> are too interesting
[3:34:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> If they just gave you a late game ability to warp back to the warp pad that'd be keen.
[3:34:28] <%gatorafan> Is the cat quest the bonus boss fight?
[3:34:44] <%gatorafan> Because if it is then that one is very intentionally hidden, the other quests shouldn't be like that.
[3:34:45] <+balouie> yeah actually hard boss fight to
[3:34:58] <Superbro64> is talking about the cat thing spoilers?
[3:34:58] <%gatorafan> Or one wouldn't expect them to be like that
[3:35:09] <ManlyMcBeefington> MikeZ's cat is pretty hidden
[3:35:22] <+balouie> you can do that after sumeru to
[3:35:46] <%gatorafan> I dunno, the cat was also on the Crowfund demo
[3:35:57] <%gatorafan> also hidden (tho probably not as much as in the full game)
[3:36:09] <Superbro64> thats a fair point
[3:36:24] <+gaspnawe> rating this game out of 10?
[3:36:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pirate girl did say that Barborossa was always a bitch after the fight.
[3:37:09] <+klholland92> The cat is on the way
[3:37:22] <Superbro64> so what do you do with the dlc characters then? @woolieversus
[3:37:29] <Superbro64> play over the game again?
[3:37:30] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:37:30] <+klholland92> To the final fight
[3:37:33] <%gatorafan> @commandersqueaks, yeah but that's Baozhai being herself, we also had this quest with Amazon mama and Tungar showing their kids all what they've learned.
[3:37:35] <Superbro64> is there a new game plus?
[3:37:38] <%gatorafan> only to get one shot'd LUL
[3:37:54] <%ozzrabbit> Breakfast? It‚Äôs almost 5pm!
[3:38:04] <%Afterman_> Woolie, after your time with SFV last night do you think it's a good game for fighting game newbies to get into?
[3:38:13] <%gatorafan> Oh wow I subconsciously already added Tungar to the family
[3:38:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> apatCrazyhead apatCrazyhead apatCrazyhead apatCrazyhead
[3:38:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> LP Tax
[3:38:55] <@SoushinSen> I delete the recordings. no evidence.
[3:39:06] <%JMDurden> rikasuPeaHype FBCatch rikasuGeorgeHEY
[3:39:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> Evil Mihn
[3:39:13] <@SoushinSen> *Minh
[3:39:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> shit
[3:39:32] <+chesterr01> @soushinsen nice, Minh
[3:39:32] <+RealThiele> The Evil with Minh
[3:39:37] <%karldeck> @soushinsen Hi Minh
[3:39:50] <Superbro64> honestly, get into gbvs
[3:39:54] <Superbro64> game will be new
[3:39:59] <Superbro64> and its simple
[3:40:32] <@Menitta> I would say any game where the given person isnt interested in it but yeah MVC is pretty rough
[3:40:47] <+balouie> blazblue and guilty gear would be so much harder if it didnt have such a good tutorial
[3:40:54] <@Menitta> Unfortunately, MVCI is the most approachable Marvel game
[3:41:14] <%JMDurden> You'll get into any game if you really want to - but it's all dependent on how bad you really want to play it.
[3:41:29] <Superbro64> mvci is probably full of no one but killers at this point
[3:41:35] <jase__x> Tekken isnt a great game for newcomers should start with Soul
[3:41:35] <Superbro64> prepare to be eaten alive
[3:42:05] <@Menitta> @Superbro64 Yeah but in terms of actual mechanics and being just a 2v2 game compared to Marvel 3, its definitely simpler
[3:42:07] <Superbro64> you probably should do power rangers, it has simple inputs, has good online, and crossplay
[3:42:09] <EndgameContent> DBFZ seems pretty easy to get into
[3:42:24] <%JMDurden> None of the fighting games are "newbie friendly" if you're just trying to jump online and win 90% of the time unless the game is ENTIRELY new.
[3:42:28] <EndgameContent> I've been playing it a little bit, just going through the combo challenges and having a good time.
[3:42:36] <BearSawed> Well getting people to understand that you will be bodied constantly and you have to be okay with that is hard
[3:43:11] <Superbro64> I still suggest gbvs honeslty. It was designed with the casual mobile playerbase in mind, per interviews
[3:43:32] <+balouie> i would say MK11 might be the most approachable for new players
[3:43:36] <BearSawed> You have to take every loss as an exciting thing to figure out.
[3:44:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> But losing feel bad tho
[3:44:30] <Superbro64> games with complex juggle systems are rough
[3:44:30] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:44:58] <Superbro64> fun fact, practically no one, even at high level, bothers to do ACTUAL optimum Sol combos
[3:45:13] <Superbro64> they require several frame perfect, pixel perfect timing
[3:45:15] <BearSawed> Losing is a way to grow, if you cant understand that you won't get into fighting games
[3:45:25] <+balouie> i remember trying to learn ivy from soul calibur for days before finally giving up
[3:45:42] <+balouie> she had one move I could never do reliably
[3:45:42] <Superbro64> maybe you could play a degenerate setup that works in a game?
[3:46:21] <%Afterman_> Based Woolie and Reggie <3. Thanks for going so in depth with an answer! I had just picked up SFV and have been wanting to get into fighting games for so long and it looked like a great game.
[3:46:53] <jase__x> Hell Killer Instinct is great for Beginners
[3:47:11] <+balouie> I do love the single player content in killer instinct
[3:47:15] <%BrooklynAIA> Sup amigos
[3:47:42] <BearSawed> Well doing the optimal anything is worthless if you cant execute it. You can win any fighting game by understanding spacing and rock paper scissors, combos are the last thing you should worry about
[3:48:01] <Superbro64> ki wins again Kappa
[3:48:28] <jase__x> KI will always win
[3:48:46] <BearSawed> Ki had bo right being as good as it was, rip
[3:49:04] <thunderhog> Just picked up tekken for the first time after never playing it, and man learning a new FG's prety cool
[3:49:27] <EndgameContent> I like that DBFZ has red HP and character switching
[3:49:28] <thunderhog> Then again i grew up on Melty so 3d fgs are weird for me
[3:49:34] <EndgameContent> Feels super strategic
[3:49:38] <itesket> anime waifu
[3:49:39] <+balouie> I was so disappointed by the new tekken as I am one of the people who love the single player content in fighters
[3:49:49] <jase__x> Ki made me realize I love Grapplers, and mixup heavy characters
[3:49:52] <EndgameContent> Oh wow, why is my message purple
[3:50:16] <thunderhog> As Samsho puts it, Embrace Death
[3:50:26] <jase__x> you highlighted you message on accident
[3:50:28] <BearSawed> Preach Reggie. Every lose is an opertunity
[3:50:32] <EndgameContent> Oh dope
[3:50:36] <@Menitta> My problem is I don't have anyone to run sets with locally.
[3:51:06] <BearSawed> @menitta try checking out discord servers for your game
[3:51:09] <Superbro64> time for GGPO save fighting games Kappa
[3:51:19] <%JMDurden> You've gotta push block, Woolie.
[3:52:04] <MasterCosmic> were can i check the schedule yall?
[3:52:05] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1210124488463077376
[3:52:42] <+balouie> I weirdly find smash really hard on breaking through beginners to actual good
[3:53:05] <BearSawed> Smash is such a different beast tho
[3:53:08] <@Menitta> Its like Morpheus telling Neo to free his mind in the Matrix
[3:53:16] <@Menitta> Kirby no!
[3:53:21] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> wooliePOYO
[3:53:29] <%JMDurden> That's because Smash has you taking into account multiple systems while combos are happening.
[3:53:32] <weissguard> Kirby! WutFace
[3:53:32] <Superbro64> to be honest, fighting games with good matchmaking should match you with beginners like yourself
[3:53:36] <%Afterman_> i would listen to you talk for hours about this lmao
[3:53:43] <Superbro64> that can only happen with rollback netcode Kappa
[3:53:46] <%Afterman_> but yes im gonna sink a shit ton of time into it, thanks again
[3:54:28] <BearSawed> actually does woolie have any discord stuff based around fgc?
[3:54:44] <%Afterman_> yeah woolie should make a discord for subs with fgc shit
[3:54:56] <%Afterman_> <3 have a good one
[3:54:57] <%gatorafan> I really don't get why people are hating on Woolie talking about fighting games so much (even if he makes an effort not to). This is interesting stuff. daedra1DerpyTibs
[3:54:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> Niiiight
[3:55:02] <Gutsandlove> bye guys
[3:55:05] <jase__x> GGAFG discord would be great

[3:59:20] <%gatorafan> @CommanderSqueaks that seems counterproducent to the channel.
[3:59:28] <Saltmeisterr> woolie don't remind me of this
[3:59:32] <%gatorafan> But I guess the guys were never really into that daedra1DerpyTibs

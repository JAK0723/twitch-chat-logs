[0:03:24] <Nina96> yeyeye
[0:03:30] <+liquidzr0> FeelsBadMan that mouse/controller combo
[0:03:31] <+klholland92> I saw a video on the internet
[0:03:35] <wydamn> I had to search for it. With the search bar.
[0:03:48] <@akuda_bar> @wydamn like some kind of criminal
[0:03:49] <+ShogunNoonto> hey
[0:03:51] <%EldritchBee> woolie shocks us all by saying hes streaming world of horror but its actually a stream of him going to the grocery
[0:04:02] <glaciusinfinite> I've seen a lot but im not sure you would be interested
[0:04:08] <%SilvaChariot0133> woolieOMG
[0:04:20] <wydamn> @akuda_bar I felt like a peasant, as if I didn't have a wireless mind-machine interface.
[0:04:29] <@akuda_bar> world of horror but it's just woolie aiming a camera out the window
[0:04:33] <+BigBruthaThunda> has Woolie played this before yet?
[0:04:43] <glaciusinfinite> not yet
[0:04:46] <+BigBruthaThunda> ooo
[0:04:48] <wydamn> I think this might be his first time
[0:04:51] <MyNameIsRasus> World of Horror but it's just his broken modem
[0:04:54] <%SilvaChariot0133> SourPls
[0:05:02] <arkv01> oh shit is that a woolie digital devil saga design?
[0:05:08] <glaciusinfinite> A purple
[0:05:08] <wydamn> They only talked about it on the podcast, and woolie thought it was a platformer.
[0:05:40] <MyNameIsRasus> Is it Punchmom on the controls tho
[0:05:41] <+BigBruthaThunda> Woolie has expressed his desire for some more Junji Ito, so this should be fun
[0:05:45] <SomersaultJustice> it's wolly time
[0:05:46] <wydamn> We all need to agree that Woolie needs to be reminded when to wall jump and when to tabletop his enemies.
[0:05:48] <NemokillerV> The broken modem was the true horror all along
[0:05:52] <cochramd1992> is that some Zelda music I hear?
[0:05:59] <+BigBruthaThunda> Chrono Trigger

[0:09:02] <+DesertPenguin> I would've but I got laid off in January. Haven't told my parents yet so I've been going out a few times a week to chill. Got lucky I guess but I still need to find work and this probably won't help
[0:09:04] <wydamn> @waffleandman just tie her up and leave her in the closet.
[0:09:18] <adamisfruit> Ah yes, fear is the mind killer
[0:09:24] <MyNameIsRasus> The coronavirus is the true biocurse
[0:09:27] <+BigBruthaThunda> I live in the Bay Area, where hanging around outside is not a misdemeanor offence
[0:09:28] <@akuda_bar> akuda_bar subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! thank you to your preshow animation for reminding me Legend of the Galactic Heroes exists, now seems like a good-ass time for it...
[0:09:32] <DaKnightWarrior> World of Horror is so sick

[0:10:28] <+DesertPenguin> I went to school for music. I wonder how they're handling online classes
[0:10:29] <Glassbrain> you cannot handle our strongest toilet paper traveller
[0:10:39] <Glassbrain> because it's paper towel
[0:10:43] <%Quiet__Viking> what is fear?

[0:12:13] <glaciusinfinite> "I'll be taking this back" says vergil walking away with your hand still.griping the Tp
[0:12:14] <wydamn> MAN, HOW ABOUT THAT 1997? Mario 64, Star Fox 64, etc
[0:12:22] <+zanzibar_junker> since you have to stay home
[0:12:31] <MyNameIsRasus> @wydamn I loved being -2
[0:12:38] <%XenoDandelion> idk 1920 was pretty hype
[0:12:39] <OkamiDude15> you are under quarantine you have no excuse to not read all of one piece Kappa
[0:12:43] <+zanzibar_junker> LOGH also has a democracy implode on itself
[0:12:49] <BigNerdSam> @theycallmenerf REZ level 5
[0:12:51] <+lethallunacyx> Oh we on 2nd gig? nice.
[0:12:54] <Glassbrain> i do have an excuse and it's called dignity
[0:12:58] <%Kriss1827> @okamidude15 youre not wrong
[0:13:04] <wydamn> @MyNameIsRasus You joke, but it's probably preferable to being grown up right now.
[0:13:15] <%CaptainPileDriver> when's Ruthless-Anarchy Reigns
[0:13:25] <OkamiDude15> @Glassbrain ill accept that excuse
[0:13:28] <@akuda_bar> 2016 was good in retrospect. we had pokemon go and i had enough money saved to goof around unemployed for a while lol
[0:13:39] <%CaptainPileDriver> that's fair
[0:13:46] <damienlunas> LOGH's democracy was hard to call a democracy because of how corrupted it was by Job Trunicht
[0:13:57] <+DesertPenguin> July 2016 I lost my best job
[0:14:00] <+DesertPenguin> So anything pre-that is great
[0:14:03] <wydamn> @akuda_bar that was pretty much my 2017, bro, good deal though.
[0:14:04] <%FrostedZaibatsu> Everyone, here. I just want you to know i love you! dekillAYAYA

[0:14:12] <atravelbee> @akuda_bar yeah i was 21 so it felt way better

[1:08:55] <%FrostedZaibatsu> *Woolie disappears into the Naruto closet*
[1:09:01] <$konekoryugamine> You need to manage the 200 seconds you have with the attacks, defense, or the other kind of spells.
[1:09:06] <boomstickery> its easy jsut go slow and read the buttons
[1:09:12] <simulationbard> You have no weapon
[1:09:12] <$Noponiz> sounds like transistor in BASE concept
[1:09:13] <KatabolicRage> I feel like the dev needs to revise the tutorial a tad, the action ring in the tutorial pic is from a real old version
[1:09:14] <lotharrio> Dial-a-DO-COMBO
[1:09:18] <hntronium> This is kinda like original xcom
[1:09:23] <boomstickery> also you should ahve equipped the bat
[1:09:25] <$konekoryugamine> They do have a weapon. The bat. It just needs to be equiped.
[1:09:26] <Nina96> ive never seen this system in any other game
[1:09:26] <cochramd1992> should've equipped the bat.....
[1:09:29] <onslaught98> HahaBall

[1:09:50] <$konekoryugamine> You have a spell but I recommend not using that until you are desperate.
[1:09:55] <%EldritchBee> They cant use the bat in the tutorial
[1:09:58] <$konekoryugamine> Click it.

[1:11:01] <%EldritchBee> knife is just a symbol
[1:11:03] <$konekoryugamine> Just to indicate physical actions.
[1:11:03] <Dr_Mooose> just a knife
[1:11:07] <lotharrio> That's just an icon for "this is offense"
[1:11:08] <%Th3SmartAlec> That knive is just a logo
[1:11:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> TUTORIAL LIMITATIONS
[1:11:19] <Ner234> CHAT. Tutorial fight. They can't do that. The Tutorial forces you to do smething else. Relax
[1:11:19] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:11:19] <wydamn> The knife is the concept of violence
[1:11:19] <TDAWS_MP132> you don't have the other 3 yet
[1:11:24] <$konekoryugamine> You can just go KICK-KICK-KICK
[1:11:33] <KatabolicRage> tutorial doesn't allow actions other than what it's telling you to do
[1:11:33] <%Th3SmartAlec> You cant do those yet
[1:11:34] <$konekoryugamine> Hit it with the XXX then the YYY
[1:11:35] <+Ryu_R> I'm 99% sure he isn't gonna read chat so I'm just gonna boogie SourPls
[1:11:38] <%Double_Tap_That> Those are action categories
[1:11:39] <RyanTheRecluse> @woolieversus there are limitations to this fight because tutorial
[1:11:40] <startstoprepeat> a lot of stuff is greyed out right now, just follow along with it
[1:11:46] <lotharrio> Look at the other options? No? Okay.
[1:11:46] <Hammatime8> "I have no bat and I must kick"
[1:11:47] <%Th3SmartAlec> ye
[1:11:57] <wydamn> @Hammatime8 LUL
[1:11:58] <$konekoryugamine> The hell does Boogie SourPls mean? I've seen that crap all over Twitch and I have next to no idea what that means.
[1:12:01] <NemokillerV> Kick the shit outta this jar
[1:12:02] <+DiabloDeAzul> you don't have enough time
[1:12:04] <Nina96> cant go over
[1:12:06] <startstoprepeat> kick takes 55 so there's no more room

[1:12:14] <hntronium> Do your maths properly
[1:12:15] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Kick requires 55 time, you cannot have more than 200 total
[1:12:16] <+projectmanatees> @konekoryugamine its an emote
[1:12:16] <OkamiDude15> punch that glass
[1:12:20] <$konekoryugamine> K
[1:12:27] <laguerrilha> "stop hitting your self"
[1:12:29] <$konekoryugamine> Oh hey, Peach is streaming Dark OSuls rn
[1:12:31] <$konekoryugamine> BRB
[1:12:43] <Nekros4442> Does Woolie know that the stats on the left are a bit cut off?
[1:12:46] <wydamn> @konekoryugamine probably related to some browser plugin that adds extra emotes. Feel free to ignore it if you're not a tryhard.
[1:12:48] <KatabolicRage> you gotta click it
[1:12:48] <Run44forrest> @konekoryugamine bttv emote you can download an extension to see it just search up bttv
[1:12:55] <Dr_Mooose> is the left slightly off screen, or that the game size also?
[1:13:00] <$konekoryugamine> AND nevermind I am back. Got greeted to Pat's beastial yawn.
[1:13:01] <hntronium> gun
[1:13:08] <%EldritchBee> @Dr_Mooose thats the game, it just looks like that
[1:13:12] <$konekoryugamine> Yep
[1:13:18] <$konekoryugamine> Soon the combat becomes second nature.
[1:13:29] <$konekoryugamine> But there are tricks to the combat.
[1:13:45] <$konekoryugamine> Knowledge based.
[1:13:45] <wydamn> DO A DOUBLE JUMP HERE
[1:13:47] <Dhurkst> Just joined. How's woolz been doing at the game?
[1:13:54] <$konekoryugamine> Tit for tat.
[1:13:56] <+Ryu_R> bad
[1:13:59] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Still in tutorial
[1:14:00] <$konekoryugamine> That's the focus of some actions.
[1:14:00] <+Ryu_R> bat*
[1:14:01] <Nekros4442> @EldritchBee I dont know about that. Everything ive seen of the game doesnt have the text cut off like that
[1:14:15] <OkamiDude15> punch mom is at the helm for this session. woolie is the spectator
[1:14:16] <ManfredA> It's No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle
[1:14:17] <presque> He's not been doing, punchmom has
[1:14:18] <$konekoryugamine> That's because of the border right now and the fact the formatting of the game is a fical bitch.
[1:14:26] <+kapcommunist> Punchmom is on the sticks, its an intersiting twist
[1:14:27] <+Mendin> The combat is assuming you didn't find the bat and giving you that bonus option
[1:14:28] <OozieStream> SMASH THAT JAR
[1:14:33] <Thirtine> !CONCUSSED!
[1:14:34] <$konekoryugamine> AND now you're concussed.
[1:14:34] <BoneofMalkav> Concussion LUL
[1:14:37] <%EldritchBee> @Nekros4442 they may have a little bit more cut off than normal but its supposed to be somewhat cut off
[1:14:41] <$konekoryugamine> Yeah that's not good either.
[1:14:41] <wydamn> CONCUSSION has been added to your injury list
[1:14:42] <+jiggy_snipe> damn you're NFL now

[1:15:00] <startstoprepeat> real life has a way higher doom counter rn
[1:15:02] <ManfredA> btw make sure to check what injuries actually do cuz not all are equal
[1:15:07] <+DiabloDeAzul> doom comes later

[1:15:46] <ManfredA> @FrostedZaibatsu doom is a delayed instant kill, death is the instant instant
[1:15:48] <$konekoryugamine> @WoolieVersus Backpack emote. Bottom left.
[1:15:49] <%Parapattern> Click on backpack below picture

[1:16:18] <wydamn> yeah, that's right motherfucker, I got a BRANCH
[1:16:27] <KatabolicRage> honestly this games tutorial could be better
[1:16:28] <ZeeJiggle> Fight this eldritch mofo with a STICK
[1:16:36] <cochramd1992> @Hammatime8 NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:16:38] <$konekoryugamine> It's the best it can do and remember, it's still in the beta stages.
[1:16:40] <+Mendin> This game is solidly in beta
[1:16:41] <hntronium> Math is hard
[1:16:44] <rubbishbinge> cant see enemy hp ;-;
[1:16:45] <+Ryu_R> just read the squares?
[1:16:49] <ManfredA> it's meant to be discovered on your own
[1:16:53] <%Th3SmartAlec> 8 HP?
[1:16:54] <$konekoryugamine> Don't judge a final product when it's in Beta.
[1:16:55] <lotharrio> Prepare then heavy attack I guess.
[1:16:56] <alephalpha> the mth is eays play aiko and slaughter everything
[1:16:56] <ManfredA> it's not a handholdy game
[1:17:00] <KatabolicRage> when in doubt, prep -> strong attack
[1:17:01] <Hammatime8> Or was the knife in the other room? My memory is REALLY bad today?
[1:17:03] <BakerBrute> nice
[1:17:03] <+Mendin> nice
[1:17:04] <MrLily> 69 ayyy
[1:17:06] <Dr_Mooose> nice
[1:17:09] <Thirtine> nice
[1:17:12] <$konekoryugamine> The knife is in the other room most of the time.
[1:17:13] <Crombells> try to use up all the time with the prep abilities
[1:17:17] <+Ryu_R> its not like a skill based game, just read a little
[1:17:34] <DrGhostJelly> double concussion
[1:17:36] <+Ahegaliant> woolieCHAN
[1:17:36] <mybigmeech> The teacher had a knife
[1:17:36] <Thirtine> DOUBLE CONCUSSION
[1:17:38] <BoneofMalkav> Double the Concussion LUL
[1:17:39] <neVan0> LUL
[1:17:40] <$konekoryugamine> Now you're double concussed.
[1:17:40] <+jiggy_snipe> oh no CTE
[1:17:42] <blackkanye> Finally brain damage
[1:17:42] <wydamn> In the this part, you need to AIRDASH into the DIAGONAL WALL and then press down to QUICK DROP.
[1:17:42] <Dr_Mooose> yeesh
[1:17:44] <Run44forrest> strong attacks arent worth it until you get higher damage weapons
[1:17:45] <$konekoryugamine> Vunderbaar.
[1:17:46] <ZeeJiggle> Stacking up all the concussions
[1:17:48] <+Th3SmartAlec> Double concussion PogChamp
[1:17:51] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Hurray, aneurysms~!
[1:17:53] <ZeeJiggle> People are JEALOUS of how many concussions we got
[1:17:55] <cochramd1992> REASON AT RISK
[1:17:56] <alephalpha> how much hp doe sit have left?
[1:18:04] <$konekoryugamine> You're gonna wanna learn to dodge soon.
[1:18:07] <+OneGorillionDollars> looks like a football player
[1:18:08] <%Th3SmartAlec> oof
[1:18:10] <Thirtine> whiff
[1:18:12] <Crombells> you should really try to use up all your time with the preps
[1:18:13] <NazarethSTG> you can guarantee your attacks
[1:18:18] <ManfredA> !!reason at risk!!
[1:18:21] <alephalpha> prep str.atk
[1:18:22] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:18:24] <+Mendin> The improvised weapon had a "Quick To Equip" tag on it
[1:18:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> You have a PREP action
[1:18:27] <%Infernal_Dalek> He looks pretty chill all things considered
[1:18:27] <lotharrio> @alephalpha She has two different health bars. One is Stamina (16) and the other is Reason (10)
[1:18:27] <Doodle_Taco> @woolieversus Try using the attack boosters
[1:18:30] <NazarethSTG> prepare attack guarantees the attack
[1:18:32] <%SilvaChariot0133> NotLikeThis
[1:18:32] <$konekoryugamine> NOPE>
[1:18:33] <Run44forrest> concussion go up
[1:18:34] <$konekoryugamine> NOT NOW.
[1:18:36] <$konekoryugamine> NOT NOW
[1:18:37] <arkv01> time for THOTS AND PRAYERS
[1:18:37] <wydamn> @WoolieVersus it helps if you PREPARE your attacks.
[1:18:38] <cochramd1992> nooooooooo
[1:18:38] <glaciusinfinite> Use a prepare action
[1:18:38] <$konekoryugamine> NOT NOW.
[1:18:41] <%Th3SmartAlec> NOT NOW
[1:18:42] <DrGhostJelly> oh boy
[1:18:42] <RyanTheRecluse> @woolieversus Injuries have specific effects, to see what they are you can click on the injury in the injury tab.
[1:18:43] <Thirtine> NOPE
[1:18:43] <alephalpha> I mena how much doe sthe enemy has it's cut off
[1:18:45] <Ernasty1> Is this YuYu Hakusho the game?
[1:18:46] <laguerrilha> the attack on the left can guarantee an attack
[1:18:49] <alephalpha> I've played this a bunch befor
[1:18:50] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Spiritual is for fighting ghosts
[1:18:51] <glaciusinfinite> No dont
[1:18:52] <+DiabloDeAzul> ghosts only
[1:18:52] <ManfredA> those are for ghosts
[1:18:58] <+TheDyingPride> Pray for mercy, you won't recieve it
[1:19:05] <$konekoryugamine> DON'T.
[1:19:07] <adamisfruit> Ghosts only
[1:19:09] <ManfredA> RUN AWAY IS SUPER STRONG THO
[1:19:10] <Dr_Mooose> become coward
[1:19:12] <ManfredA> not right now though
[1:19:15] <$konekoryugamine> You can't run from a tutorial fight.
[1:19:17] <adamisfruit> Ghosts only, this is t ghost
[1:19:26] <ZeeJiggle> Das a good button
[1:19:29] <alephalpha> run is strong unless you aiko or against ithachac
[1:19:29] <ManfredA> some enemies just aren't worth fighting
[1:19:31] <wydamn> Run away is the Jojo strategy
[1:19:34] <$konekoryugamine> No, ghosts in the game right now have a more fierce attack strength. Update.
[1:19:34] <Crombells> you are actively reducing your chance to hit by now using the preps to maximize the time spent
[1:19:35] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Running is a legitimate strategy
[1:19:37] <%schlager087> so what boss is this?
[1:19:40] <+DiabloDeAzul> Dodge scales with Dex, so it can be OP
[1:19:45] <$konekoryugamine> Mods will be ready to be implemented for the game in April.
[1:19:52] <%Th3SmartAlec> @schlager087 Tutorial enemy
[1:19:52] <lotharrio> Two or three light attacks might be better than a light and heavy.
[1:20:00] <Dhurkst> @Ernasty1 Yuyu Hakusho if the author were influenced by night terrors, drugs, and severe mental health issues. Not really, it's a cross between Lovecraft & Junji Ito.

[1:24:50] <ManfredA> she's still nightmare fuel if you don't do the ritual
[1:24:51] <laguerrilha> Beauty is relative....
[1:24:53] <+Mendin> This game is Japanese Arkham Horror ft Junji Ito
[1:25:00] <BoneofMalkav> ^
[1:25:00] <Galacta_Pieta> Do not fuck a human centipede
[1:25:03] <glaciusinfinite> Use prepare
[1:25:04] <$konekoryugamine> Hey Woolie! You gave me an idea! Watch your Twitter feed!!
[1:25:09] <%Th3SmartAlec> Next action
[1:25:10] <glaciusinfinite> yes
[1:25:14] <anita_dickin> no DONT fuck a human centepexe
[1:25:16] <nerdblase> At least a whole tube of lipstick goes into that face.
[1:25:19] <xxterminatorviixx> So she’s a death scissor
[1:25:22] <$konekoryugamine> And got the screenshot.
[1:25:23] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1239789488349614081?s=20
[1:25:23] <$konekoryugamine> Boom
[1:25:25] <+TheGamerMaldito> Oh, I know this legend, you have to answer "you are average" BibleThump
[1:25:30] <alephalpha> she's kuchisaki onna
[1:25:32] <$konekoryugamine> I thought that didn't work
[1:25:36] <NazarethSTG> guarantees attacks only
[1:25:38] <ManfredA> @TheGamerMaldito this game has the tp ghost too
[1:25:38] <SuperKirby24> so if you fuck a human centipede is it just the one person or everyone Kappa
[1:25:40] <$konekoryugamine> YOu need to DOOOOOOOODGE
[1:25:42] <%Th3SmartAlec> not a good idea generally
[1:25:43] <blackkanye> They are two seperate healthbars
[1:25:45] <alephalpha> yeah if you call her ugly or beatiful get wrecked
[1:25:46] <+Fierbras> The damage type is on the top left
[1:25:47] <Dhurkst> @TheGamerMaldito or give her some hard candy, apparently
[1:25:50] <$konekoryugamine> YOU CAN DODGE
[1:25:51] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Reason is a health type
[1:25:53] <Thirtine> actually not a bad idae if you heal with the lump
[1:25:56] <$konekoryugamine> NO!
[1:25:57] <BoneofMalkav> She does 2 Damage to Both Stamina and Reason
[1:25:58] <Blastotron> Swing Away
[1:25:59] <+lethallunacyx> She'll really get a-head in life
[1:26:02] <+PhantasmaXD> @konekoryugamine shhhh
[1:26:02] <$konekoryugamine> You can't just keep hitting her!!
[1:26:03] <Doodle_Taco> Do combo
[1:26:08] <RyanTheRecluse> look at the enemy stats top left
[1:26:08] <lotharrio> Looks like you can just barely get in that bottom offensive action, too.
[1:26:09] <DrGhostJelly> I'm guessing it has 14 hp now?
[1:26:14] <Dr_Mooose> ye
[1:26:15] <alephalpha> they can win this
[1:26:15] <glaciusinfinite> Three forms of health
[1:26:15] <+PhantasmaXD> :D
[1:26:16] <ManfredA> 24
[1:26:17] <+konekoryugamine> She takes 2 Reason and 2 Stamina!
[1:26:18] <suitangi021> The top left shows her hp what damage she does and pwr determines your chance to hit them and vice versa
[1:26:18] <%Th3SmartAlec> Keep doing that
[1:26:21] <+konekoryugamine> YOu have to defend!!
[1:26:22] <BakerBrute> Super winnable
[1:26:23] <NemokillerV> @DrGhostJelly ye
[1:26:25] <+konekoryugamine> YOU LOSE!
[1:26:30] <Renkage> Window seems to be cut off a bit. That on purpose?
[1:26:30] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It does
[1:26:31] <blackkanye> It is a game over bro
[1:26:31] <startstoprepeat> the top left says what kind of damage the enemy does, she does -2 to all
[1:26:31] <+konekoryugamine> When your stamina runs out, you lose!
[1:26:32] <%Th3SmartAlec> You go nuts (GAME OVER)
[1:26:33] <laguerrilha> She can give head x3. She would be popular in Japan
[1:26:35] <+jiggy_snipe> naw
[1:26:38] <+konekoryugamine> The god has won when your reason is gone!
[1:26:38] <+kapcommunist> chill
[1:26:39] <%SilvaChariot0133> ! FRENZY !
[1:26:40] <+jiggy_snipe> keep swinging
[1:26:41] <YakumoYomi> Both stamina and reason are life bars
[1:26:42] <+PhantasmaXD> @laguerrilha BIG FACTS
[1:26:42] <%Vegaburd> Vegaburd subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! Hey Woolz, your Doom LP was amazing. Keep that content flowing my mans
[1:26:43] <%ekodrop> what happened to the bat
[1:26:43] <ManfredA> yeah she's eldritch, not ghost
[1:26:45] <+DiabloDeAzul> you already did the ritual
[1:26:46] <BakerBrute> @konekoryugamine You can actually pretty easily justify just swinging out every turn
[1:26:46] <ssmotzer> Why do magic when you have a bat?
[1:26:57] <+konekoryugamine> That's why there's a dodge option!
[1:26:58] <+DiabloDeAzul> @ekodrop bat's equipped
[1:26:58] <ManfredA> magic is for fighting ghosts
[1:27:03] <Tucker0603> just murder
[1:27:04] <RyanTheRecluse> that works
[1:27:06] <%ekodrop> oh finally
[1:27:06] <+jiggy_snipe> only offense
[1:27:11] <+konekoryugamine> Oh dang it.
[1:27:15] <+konekoryugamine> NO
[1:27:18] <alephalpha> ayyyy
[1:27:20] <adamisfruit> Just keep attacking
[1:27:20] <mybigmeech> Rip
[1:27:20] <Dr_Mooose> oh boy
[1:27:20] <YakumoYomi> Two turns left
[1:27:21] <Crombells> use up all your time, prepping is key
[1:27:23] <%Th3SmartAlec> Do prep
[1:27:26] <reonome> DODGE
[1:27:27] <%SilvaChariot0133> NotLikeThis
[1:27:27] <Tucker0603> prep and murder
[1:27:27] <RyanTheRecluse> you can take 2 more hits
[1:27:28] <hntronium> No such thing as accuracy
[1:27:28] <+solzan2000> o_o
[1:27:28] <NazarethSTG> bawkOmega
[1:27:29] <+konekoryugamine> DODGE - PREP - HIT
[1:27:31] <+PhantasmaXD> @konekoryugamine let them figure it out
[1:27:34] <+PatMorgana> shes almost dead!
[1:27:35] <alephalpha> 2 turn clock
[1:27:36] <+arknodem> Prep will gaurentee your next attack.
[1:27:38] <Dr_Mooose> not looking too good
[1:27:40] <glaciusinfinite> Ooh that image
[1:27:44] <rubbishbinge> 2 turns until dead
[1:27:47] <+konekoryugamine> Sorry, I'm getting that anxiety feeling again.
[1:27:48] <+kapcommunist> wheres the cry option?
[1:27:50] <+konekoryugamine> I gotta stop.
[1:27:54] <blackkanye> I mean if they do 1 damage brace lowers it to 0
[1:27:54] <alephalpha> this game is all dps races umnless you're using dogde with good dex
[1:27:55] <Galacta_Pieta> I dont think she is nearly dead, the hp is cut off
[1:27:57] <+konekoryugamine> And there's no cry aoption.
[1:27:58] <%SilvaChariot0133> High damage is the best form of mitigation Kappa
[1:27:58] <blackkanye> so not in that situation
[1:27:59] <+TheDyingPride> Oh man, I just noticed she uglier now
[1:28:02] <+konekoryugamine> AOPTION SURE
[1:28:04] <+Mendin> * b u t. n o b o d y. c a m e.
[1:28:04] <+DiabloDeAzul> woolie play like you're in dark souls
[1:28:05] <mybigmeech> Oh god, she looks worse now somehow
[1:28:05] <+jiggy_snipe> yea Woolie good explanation
[1:28:06] <reonome> she has 14 hp lol
[1:28:07] <lotharrio> Prep SAtk Aim Atk
[1:28:08] <+konekoryugamine> OH GOD
[1:28:08] <laguerrilha> but normally in games against bosses you want to defend
[1:28:12] <cochramd1992> she way uglier
[1:28:13] <+Ryu_R> :p :p :p
[1:28:18] <+jiggy_snipe> this Sekiro not Dark Souls
[1:28:19] <%Double_Tap_That> If you look below the enemy name, you can see the enemy's current health and damage they do per attack.
[1:28:19] <@Solidus_113> never stop going in
[1:28:21] <+konekoryugamine> I did NOT expect her to be ulgies!
[1:28:24] <GKannel> offense sometimes is the best defense
[1:28:25] <@Solidus_113> SUUUUUUUUUUUPER DAAAAAAASH
[1:28:26] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @wydamn
[1:28:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> Prepping is also good

[1:29:03] <RyanTheRecluse> big enemy attack - dodge = big death
[1:29:03] <TDAWS_MP132> nope LUL
[1:29:04] <Valentinius_Anodyne> More or less completed the tutorial at least
[1:29:04] <%allups> rip
[1:29:04] <+PapermanXD> AGAIN
[1:29:06] <+konekoryugamine> Yep.
[1:29:07] <alephalpha> should have dps raced from the start
[1:29:08] <+paladinstarbuster> I BLAME WOOLIE
[1:29:09] <Doodle_Taco> Nah
[1:29:10] <Tucker0603> no, just hard murder
[1:29:11] <+DiabloDeAzul> woolie pls
[1:29:11] <+konekoryugamine> Defense works well in this game.
[1:29:11] <RockLobster52> Dodge is worth using
[1:29:13] <illTemperedSeaBass> It absolutely would've, Woolie. Too much unga, too much bunga.
[1:29:15] <%allups> it wouldve
[1:29:19] <alephalpha> dodge is good especially with aiko
[1:29:21] <%schlager087> so are you supposed to defend when she raises her shit?
[1:29:26] <Manwad> defense in this game is great
[1:29:29] <Dhurkst> LUL LUL LUL
[1:29:29] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[1:29:30] <cochramd1992> LUL
[1:29:32] <blackkanye> Defense is super good in this game. Especially against 1 damage enemies
[1:29:32] <Dr_Mooose> LUL
[1:29:33] <powerprotoman> shes right too
[1:29:33] <reonome> yeah its woolie's fault LUL
[1:29:35] <KatabolicRage> honestly this game tends towards DPS races
[1:29:35] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Sounds good to me :)
[1:29:40] <%allups> the truths hurts
[1:29:40] <+paladinstarbuster> SUPER RIGHT
[1:29:42] <rubbishbinge> not wrong
[1:29:46] <OkamiDude15> she's actually right
[1:29:49] <+konekoryugamine> @WoolieVersus The actions to defend are a good mix in between the offensive actions. Dodge, then prep the attack, then go in for a stricke
[1:29:49] <%Th3SmartAlec> YES YOU DO
[1:29:50] <JetpackMcQuack> Truuu
[1:29:51] <theKingRamses> you do know her hp
[1:29:51] <KatabolicRage> you know EXACTLY how much life she has, it's in the top left
[1:29:52] <reonome> you can see her HP right there though
[1:29:53] <+Pyroclase> she does have a healthbar
[1:29:54] <RyanTheRecluse> look at those log entries
[1:29:55] <blackkanye> But you do know her hp
[1:29:57] <%Th3SmartAlec> SHE HAS HEALTH
[1:29:58] <GKannel> you know her health
[1:29:59] <+konekoryugamine> If you nonsense attack, you die instantly.
[1:30:00] <Mr_Rakjo> THe life is at the corner top left of the screan
[1:30:03] <+jiggy_snipe> I think the life is cut off for them
[1:30:04] <weirdducks> you can see her hp on the left
[1:30:04] <Crombells> her HP was visible
[1:30:05] <rubbishbinge> Your setup is cropping out HP
[1:30:05] <+Ryu_R> its only listed on screen :)
[1:30:06] <Tucker0603> you can CLEARLY see her HP
[1:30:06] <lotharrio> Woolie you gotta learn to read more. The boss' HP was in the upper left corner.
[1:30:06] <+BKNPham> the hp is cut off
[1:30:06] <Manwad> did they not see the damage types
[1:30:06] <%derap41> Losing is fun
[1:30:09] <laguerrilha> when a boss is doing something different in games you want to get back and def
[1:30:10] <+jiggy_snipe> but it's in the top left
[1:30:11] <ImasukyLomae> Her hp was on screen
[1:30:14] <glaciusinfinite> you can see health at the top left
[1:30:14] <+Pyroclase> it's misaligned
[1:30:16] <Iam_Dead> you can see life at top left and damage she does under
[1:30:17] <%derap41> Dwarf Fortress mentality
[1:30:18] <+Ryu_R> YEAH SKULLGIRLS
[1:30:18] <Dhurkst> Look at it like Dark Souls: unga leads to death
[1:30:19] <%GeneralSCPatton> HP WAS ON SCREEN
[1:30:19] <%Th3SmartAlec> @WoolieVersus HP is on the top left
[1:30:21] <+konekoryugamine> Yeah that's a thing that happens.
[1:30:26] <RyanTheRecluse> that's weird
[1:30:29] <+konekoryugamine> Skullgirls?
[1:30:29] <+PhantasmaXD> LUL
[1:30:30] <+jiggy_snipe> hmmmm
[1:30:30] <Dr_Mooose> Skullgirls PogChamo
[1:30:31] <cochramd1992> LUL LUL LUL

[1:30:32] <GKannel> oof
[1:30:32] <powerprotoman> look at what you did woolie
[1:30:34] <+PhantasmaXD> SKILLGURLZ
[1:30:34] <Dr_Mooose> PogChamp
[1:30:37] <KatabolicRage> your desktop is pretty clean tbh
[1:30:38] <reonome> WOOLIE'S FAULT
[1:30:41] <BackwardCap> Fighting Herds PogChamp
[1:30:41] <+DiabloDeAzul> it centers itself after every screen transition
[1:30:42] <SuperKirby24> botch LUL
[1:30:43] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Ryu_R
[1:30:43] <+jiggy_snipe> Them Fighting Herds
[1:30:44] <+konekoryugamine> Is that a Danganronpa background?
[1:30:46] <%derap41> We can see everthing
[1:30:46] <simulationbard> Oh no we can see all of Woolie's porn
[1:30:48] <laguerrilha> TFH
[1:30:54] <+jiggy_snipe> BIG RECYCLING BIN
[1:30:57] <SuperKirby24> fighting herdsa nice
[1:30:57] <+TheGamerMaldito> Alt+Enter maybe?
[1:30:58] <%derap41> All of Woolie's porn is there
[1:30:58] <+Mendin> World of Digital Horror
[1:30:59] <%Theycallmenerf> Balls exposed
[1:31:00] <+konekoryugamine> Yeah good call
[1:31:01] <laguerrilha> Look at all that tomboy porn!
[1:31:02] <ZeeJiggle> Yo was that a Wolf Among Us wallpaper I saw?
[1:31:03] <ManfredA> also this is an adventure game, look at everything on the screen
[1:31:03] <nerdblase> Skullgirls party never stopped.
[1:31:09] <ManfredA> don't hyperfocus on one part
[1:31:10] <bassoontyphoon> hi everyone in quarantine
[1:31:19] <masterfire23> fetish folders exposed ?
[1:31:20] <+konekoryugamine> So yeah, defense is important.
[1:31:31] <%derap41> Has Kirby always been there?
[1:31:32] <ManfredA> THIS GAME LIKES BIG COWARDICE
[1:31:37] <powerprotoman> woolie its horror
[1:31:38] <+Fierbras> Your lose condition is Stamina = 0, Reason = 0, and/or doom is 100%.
[1:31:40] <ManfredA> cowards live
[1:31:40] <hntronium> Cowardice is for death
[1:31:44] <%allups> but most horror gams are all about tht shit
[1:31:46] <Renkage> Running away is SUPER powerful. As long as you can sacrifice the DOOM
[1:31:47] <Iam_Dead> game loves coward
[1:31:49] <+DiabloDeAzul> Woolie chill, there is no joysticc
[1:31:49] <arkv01> no worries, it's fun to cruise and bruise
[1:31:50] <RyanTheRecluse> yup
[1:31:51] <%GeneralSCPatton> You can win fast or die slow
[1:31:53] <startstoprepeat> using brace on a 1 damage attack results in no damage, you can lame it out pretty hard
[1:31:58] <Manwad> It is exactly that thing
[1:32:00] <wydamn> Joker mod incoming
[1:32:00] <blackkanye> It was, but I don't know if you can avoid the injury it causes
[1:32:02] <Dr_Mooose> cowards live, heroes die
[1:32:07] <reonome> you were gonna die either way
[1:32:11] <blackkanye> The scissor raise thing specifically cause an injury
[1:32:15] <hntronium> You can win fast and die fast or you can not win and die
[1:32:24] <de1ete_forever> my toilet paper fort has it's own sub basement panic room
[1:32:25] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:32:27] <HellsCherry> I love this game wrecking woolie's gaming philosophy
[1:32:29] <+jiggy_snipe> also Punch Mom should click on some of the conditions like Cursed and Concussion just to see what they do
[1:32:31] <Iam_Dead> @woolieversus when she readied the scissors that's a big attack callout.
[1:32:32] <laguerrilha> This layout is messy. Its not your fault
[1:32:32] <ManfredA> this game is about resource management
[1:32:37] <illTemperedSeaBass> Those games aren't horror games. In horror games cowardice being the winning strat is the running trope.
[1:32:41] <lotharrio> Learn to double-click!
[1:32:42] <ManfredA> wasting too much resource on a fight is bad
[1:32:49] <wydamn> @de1ete_forever My toilet paper armor will absorb any microbes.
[1:32:50] <ManfredA> cowards only waste doom
[1:32:50] <+Mendin> @WoolieVersus Punchmom, look up a youtube series of a literal 71 year old grandma playing Skyrim
[1:32:50] <+jiggy_snipe> it's cool, we get it
[1:32:52] <+BKNPham> yea it's not your fault
[1:32:56] <%derap41> This is well known phenoma
[1:32:57] <Prevot> punch grandma
[1:32:58] <+Mendin> She is a shining motivation
[1:32:58] <+Despera__> It's a rougelike! You're supposed to die
[1:32:58] <+TheDyingPride> It's a pretty information heavy UI
[1:33:05] <rubbishbinge> its ok you tried :)
[1:33:06] <+MrRabbles> BloodTrail BloodTrail
[1:33:07] <OozieStream> Her raising the scissors means she's going to slit your mouth.
[1:33:07] <bassoontyphoon> this type of game needs you to die to learn
[1:33:09] <simulationbard> Yeah this game's a little dense
[1:33:10] <MasterDecoder> You're learning, it's fine, text based games are weird anyway
[1:33:10] <laguerrilha> i play a lot of rpgs and this layout was VERY confusing
[1:33:11] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Are we not all dummies at one point?
[1:33:12] <blackkanye> It is a rougelike so it is fine
[1:33:15] <Tucker0603> so ya know enemy HP is on the left side of the screen. but it indeed a learning experience
[1:33:16] <%allups> i cannot imagine how hard it is to get into games as an adult
[1:33:17] <+BigBruthaThunda> It's a rougelite, so you're meant to die a bunch
[1:33:17] <YakumoYomi> The layout is visually noisy, so don't worry about it. You did alright.
[1:33:18] <+Fierbras> World of Horror Monsters have Health and Damage types. You can see that information on the top left of the combat screen.
[1:33:19] <Dr_Mooose> the UI is pretty busy
[1:33:21] <+jiggy_snipe> well it's a rougelike so dying is expected
[1:33:21] <OkamiDude15> the layout is kinda all over the place but once you learn its fine
[1:33:21] <wydamn> @Mendin Is that a real thing? I need to find that.
[1:33:22] <%derap41> Now Do Dark Souls
[1:33:22] <+lethallunacyx> This is kind of a die more often than not kinda game
[1:33:22] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> <3
[1:33:23] <%Vegaburd> Your a boomer!
[1:33:25] <hntronium> Woolie
[1:33:25] <+thatskindaraven> Just joined, is it starting or did I miss itr
[1:33:26] <$Noponiz> it'S a roguelike so failure is literally intended
[1:33:26] <startstoprepeat> that would've been the end of the tutorial, better to play the game proper now
[1:33:41] <hntronium> Woolie's philosophy of getting in there is not wrong for this game
[1:33:41] <reonome> the game's UI is pretty overwhelming ngl
[1:33:49] <ManfredA> pro tip: when you're better, beat her without doing the ritual to get something really nice
[1:34:06] <RyanTheRecluse> you can do the 2nd run now, you don't have anything left to learn from that tutorial
[1:34:22] <%optimasmaximas> this was real cool seein punchmom play
[1:34:22] <OkamiDude15> @thatskindaraven punch mom died on tutorial boss fight and woolie is fixing the capture is what you missed
[1:34:56] <%derap41> Dark Souls does it really interestingly
[1:35:18] <@Solidus_113> we on a CRT
[1:35:21] <TurtleButter> Stylish
[1:35:26] <RyanTheRecluse> @manfreda I got that ending by accident because I stopped the chalk design when the log said it should be correct and lied to me.
[1:35:29] <Dr_Mooose> I like this
[1:35:29] <+jiggy_snipe> looks nice
[1:35:32] <hntronium> You can change the color if you want
[1:35:33] <+Mendin> Switch to 2bit mode for crisper graphics
[1:35:38] <ManfredA> @Solidus_113 it's an old monitor, you can pull even further back
[1:35:50] <%allups> at least in DS u can always just get stronger
[1:35:59] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Nah, you got this
[1:35:59] <%SilvaChariot0133> Just git gud 4Head
[1:36:00] <lotharrio> It's mostly just addition.
[1:36:03] <+jiggy_snipe> Couples playthrough lol
[1:36:07] <DickTheHonduranSipsUrine> awwww
[1:36:09] <wydamn> Woolie, Don't let her talk you into making this an Omnikron
[1:36:09] <%optimasmaximas> co-op PogChamp
[1:36:09] <Renkage> I mean...Implying Woolie has the brain for it Kappa
[1:36:10] <+paladinstarbuster> U CAN DO IT
[1:36:10] <@Solidus_113> @ManfredA yes... a CRT
[1:36:17] <Prevot> world of backdowns
[1:36:17] <%allups> so woolie plays the gameplay
[1:36:26] <theKingRamses> woolie do combo
[1:36:27] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie there is health in the top left
[1:36:28] <hntronium> Just backseat each other
[1:36:31] <+DiabloDeAzul> lifeline Woolie LUL
[1:36:33] <presque> It's not like he's gonna play faster, it's still rpg Woolie
[1:36:35] <Turning2Dust> I believe in Punch-Mom's ability to punch
[1:36:35] <+jiggy_snipe> I wanna see you mess up together :)
[1:36:37] <ZeeJiggle> No see Chat wants to be the backseat
[1:36:41] <OozieStream> A CRT so you can always play Melee!
[1:36:47] <%allups> i think she can handle the combat
[1:36:50] <ZeeJiggle> It's a rollercoaster here
[1:36:57] <%GeneralSCPatton> DO EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES
[1:37:02] <KatabolicRage> just remmember you can take your time, mouse over and click things, etc
[1:37:03] <ManfredA> it's mostly just learning what works
[1:37:07] <ManfredA> patience is key
[1:37:08] <KatabolicRage> all very much turn based
[1:37:33] <ManfredA> like spiritual can be almost entirely ignored against non-ghosts
[1:37:36] <cochramd1992> chat always wants to backseat
[1:37:40] <+Valentttine> is that the toyota deja vu car??
[1:38:04] <lotharrio> Big coward runaway is a strong option in random encounters.
[1:38:07] <+Valentttine> y'all know what i mean
[1:38:20] <OkamiDude15> yeah looks and probably is an 86
[1:38:32] <Dr_Mooose> enemies hurt
[1:38:36] <Doodle_Taco> This game is hard
[1:38:37] <+Mendin> You were unlucky in that all events and the main enemy both did Reason damage
[1:38:45] <RyanTheRecluse> So defense/dodge is actually good.
[1:38:48] <ManfredA> this is a roguelike so sometimes
[1:38:51] <ManfredA> you just get screwed
[1:38:54] <weirdducks> enemies in this game do a ton of damage
[1:38:55] <Dr_Mooose> they do not hold back
[1:38:56] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah, this game is intended to be tricky
[1:38:58] <lotharrio> The double-concussion ruined you.
[1:38:59] <djazo> @WoolieVersus you need to prep more
[1:39:03] <theKingRamses> you leave the encounter battle scarred
[1:39:04] <+lethallunacyx> Dodge/def can be good depends on the enemy
[1:39:06] <OkamiDude15> rougelikes are meant to be replayed alot so yeah
[1:39:15] <ManfredA> like yeah you can just get fucked in this game and nothing you can do
[1:39:22] <%allups> its a roguelike so u are ganna keep dying
[1:39:24] <Crombells> @lotharrio don't concussions only decrease knowledge?
[1:39:27] <+lethallunacyx> and rng is big here
[1:39:27] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:39:37] <wydamn> LUL
[1:39:42] <beatie_g> Did I miss the first run?
[1:39:47] <RyanTheRecluse> double concussion just drops knowledge, doesn't effect combat unless you're running a spell caster
[1:39:53] <%GeneralSCPatton> EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES
[1:39:53] <wydamn> DO THE NEXT ONE
[1:39:55] <OkamiDude15> you missed the tutorial run
[1:39:58] <+jiggy_snipe> when you're not a gamer it makes sense that it could be overwhelming
[1:40:01] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Already completed the first, really
[1:40:02] <%Th3SmartAlec> Nice
[1:40:03] <Doodle_Taco> Do extracurriculae activity
[1:40:04] <de1ete_forever> in all fairness, the P3 party turn base is sketchy at times
[1:40:07] <+Mendin> Ambient
[1:40:07] <ZeeJiggle> Spooky mood
[1:40:11] <+jiggy_snipe> mood set
[1:40:11] <cochramd1992> imagine not being a gamer Kappa
[1:40:12] <Prevot> comfy stream
[1:40:14] <Dhurkst> Big spoops!
[1:40:14] <%Th3SmartAlec> @de1ete_forever Marin fucking Karin
[1:40:14] <lotharrio> @Crombells You're right, it was the other one. She got a damage over time effect.
[1:40:16] <%allups> sexy
[1:40:18] <Dr_Mooose> VS after dark
[1:40:21] <ZeeJiggle> And hey that looks fine on the capture
[1:40:25] <RyanTheRecluse> extracurricular activity would be your best bet
[1:40:25] <DickTheHonduranSipsUrine> SpoOoOoKy
[1:40:27] <%GeneralSCPatton> 2ND ONE
[1:40:29] <ManfredA> she is tho
[1:40:30] <fabo_joyful> Vs dark-mood
[1:40:32] <RyanTheRecluse> awww
[1:40:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> YOU WERE 99% DONE
[1:40:35] <Crombells> @lotharrio the curse also only affects spellcasting
[1:40:35] <%Th3SmartAlec> Heads up, HEALTH in top left
[1:40:36] <MassConnect> woolie vs electric bills
[1:40:38] <+lethallunacyx> also there is some min/maxing when it comes to damage output and again it depends on the chars strengths
[1:40:43] <Doodle_Taco> She totally is
[1:40:46] <%Ecchigun> 2nd optionn
[1:40:48] <Thirtine> nope, you did do this lul
[1:40:51] <Tucker0603> yes you did
[1:40:55] <Ner234> You did this LUL
[1:40:57] <Turning2Dust> Shit's fucked - The Game
[1:41:00] <%SilvaChariot0133> LUL
[1:41:00] <cochramd1992> mmmmmm TITTIES
[1:41:02] <%Th3SmartAlec> This tutoral is mostly the same
[1:41:03] <lotharrio> @Crombells Well then I guess I'm wrong /
[1:41:04] <@akuda_bar> mmmmm GURL
[1:41:06] <%SilvaChariot0133> 👀
[1:41:10] <blackkanye> My first test mod might be making a few charisma weapons
[1:41:18] <%SilvaChariot0133> 2nd is for after tutorial
[1:41:20] <Valentinius_Anodyne> The tutorial is complete, you died literally at the end
[1:41:22] <RyanTheRecluse> the tutorial ended with that fight woolie
[1:41:22] <+Pyroclase> the second option is best for a first playthrough
[1:41:23] <blackkanye> Because that is the only stat that has none besides FND
[1:41:24] <reonome> you were like 99% done
[1:41:26] <ManfredA> it's a regular case
[1:41:27] <+jiggy_snipe> no one forgets that personality Kappa
[1:41:30] <hntronium> 2nd is basically bigger tutorial
[1:41:30] <%Th3SmartAlec> Yeah, do the tutorial again to get a grip
[1:41:30] <KatabolicRage> right arrow on text
[1:41:30] <+NuclearLawlocausto> This game is strangely enthralling
[1:41:35] <KatabolicRage> aah they skipped it again
[1:41:36] <Turning2Dust> Get through the first mystery, it's a good microcosm to help with the classic mode
[1:41:43] <Doodle_Taco> You learned everything there was to learn
[1:41:56] <KatabolicRage> it aint lying about this being a small snippet of the main game
[1:41:57] <waffleandman> q

[2:02:13] <somekindofgnome> This music always mindfloods me
[2:02:13] <%Th3SmartAlec> Paitent Zero = sidequest for more EXP
[2:02:21] <KatabolicRage> it can also have effects on the overall mysteyr

[2:02:55] <%GeneralSCPatton> PATIENT ZERO IS SIDEQUEST. DO IT
[2:02:55] <NeroInfinite> screaming in my skiiiin
[2:02:55] <%Th3SmartAlec> Patient Zero = sidequest
[2:02:56] <Crombells> Patient Zero is an optional objective
[2:02:56] <+Mendin> @WoolieVersus The circle is the main quest, the sticky note is a -side- quest
[2:03:10] <+lethallunacyx> To be fair it's not very clear
[2:03:11] <%Th3SmartAlec> THAT TAKES TIME
[2:03:19] <NeroInfinite> The side quest helps out tho
[2:03:22] <RyanTheRecluse> village is the ten gate down the bottom, is f9r a side quest to get more information
[2:03:32] <Nekros4442> Read the side quest
[2:03:44] <KatabolicRage> the circle is the main objective, you can go to other places for whatever reason
[2:03:46] <blackkanye> Some endings are triggered by the side quests
[2:03:47] <%Th3SmartAlec> Circle = main quest, Patient Zero = side quest
[2:03:51] <%DensityD> no weapon
[2:03:51] <glaciusinfinite> Can you here it? Chat is screaming...
[2:03:55] <%DensityD> no knowledge
[2:03:58] <%DensityD> no nothing
[2:04:01] <%GeneralSCPatton> Circle=main. Patient Zero is sidequest that helps.
[2:04:04] <BoneofMalkav> Also Side Quests on your right can help you with the mystery
[2:04:05] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Circle to complete main mission, but you can technically go anywhere
[2:04:11] <wrydiculous> circle is hard progression
[2:04:13] <RyanTheRecluse> Chat(nothing)
[2:04:25] <NeroInfinite> Chat bleeds words like you and I bleed red
[2:04:29] <Timesteel> check the locations as well some have shops
[2:04:30] <MooseoneLivedhere> please someone read the chat
[2:04:48] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie is adamant not to get help

[2:06:20] <Timesteel> downtown and seaside have shops as well
[2:06:33] <BoneofMalkav> ^
[2:06:34] <RyanTheRecluse> you can investigate anything else to explore/get more encounters
[2:06:40] <+lethallunacyx> 6 billion sets of eyes
[2:06:43] <@Solidus_113> Just know all information at all times
[2:06:47] <wrydiculous> To be fair, first timers will be stumped at this UI

[2:07:49] <lotharrio> You always blame them. They only make it worse and they NEVER get cool enough powers to justify it.
[2:07:51] <RyanTheRecluse> @generalscpatton Yeah, Reggie's eyes on the inside are our eyes.
[2:07:52] <meromaromiro> Hitler is real can you bla
[2:07:53] <ZeeR01> I just wanted a quite life in morioh

[2:10:36] <Ozavic> Remember, Punchmom is out of their element, we gotta be nice
[2:10:38] <Ne0classical> Its actually sometimes better to not use the dust imo.
[2:10:40] <lotharrio> I'd want a weapon before I start investigating
[2:10:42] <Run44forrest> chat she will die if she goes for ending A hasMods

[2:11:18] <startstoprepeat> @WoolieVersus also you can click all these locations to see what's in them before actually deciding
[2:11:18] <NazarethSTG> you can buy a weapon

[2:13:21] <MaverickJoker> good borkers
[2:13:22] <illTemperedSeaBass> @WoolieVersus I think that's a reduction to the MODIFIER. Say you had a +5 to the roll, if you needed to roll a 19, a 14 or above would work, because you have a +5 modifier. -1 modifier is a bad thing. Means you have a +4 instead.
[2:13:22] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> BOOP

[2:13:55] <+lethallunacyx> compass will replace ring

[2:13:57] <NeroInfinite> Ye
[2:13:58] <coracor> LUL
[2:14:00] <MaverickJoker> idk
[2:14:00] <+McSnazzyPants> skill checks in this game work by trying to roll lower than your stat number. threat level will add to your roll, making it harder to succeed
[2:14:00] <anar_bael> Boop dog on nose
[2:14:01] <ImasukyLomae> compass yes
[2:14:02] <%DensityD> exp boost, nice

[2:14:22] <+Mendin> Since this is basically the start of the game, the compass will give big payoffs
[2:14:23] <glaciusinfinite> HAVING 0 FUNDS IS REAL BAD
[2:14:24] <plo135> Get compaa use ring
[2:14:27] <blackkanye> Only when you enter
[2:14:28] <RyanTheRecluse> doom st 100% is a bad thing
[2:14:30] <ManfredA> they can use the ring

[2:15:00] <Run44forrest> having 0 funds is fine its just -3 stamina or reason or +5 doom
[2:15:04] <RyanTheRecluse> remember to equip
[2:15:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> Compass and flashlight are the BEST ITEMS
[2:15:13] <rubbishbinge> eat the ring
[2:15:15] <Ne0classical> Sell ring, go to seaside and buy a hammer to kill god
[2:15:28] <+LunarDensetsu> Discoun item

[2:18:51] <blackkanye> This package was made for me
[2:18:51] <alephalpha> too smart to look
[2:18:51] <%DensityD> that intoxicating aroma
[2:18:56] <MaverickJoker> too much strawberry jam
[2:18:56] <rubbishbinge> it was spaghetti
[2:18:59] <Crombells> It's just blood! There's blood in the box!
[2:19:00] <+Mendin> Woolie please put the camera on
[2:19:05] <+jiggy_snipe> remember DOOM
[2:19:10] <waffleandman> sometimes you win the game when you think you cant
[2:19:11] <ManfredA> it's just bonus events
[2:19:13] <%Th3SmartAlec> It's random events
[2:19:18] <sexdrugsvideogames> it was a package from the cult
[2:19:18] <ManfredA> it's not actually helping the investigation
[2:19:22] <%GeneralSCPatton> Big random events
[2:19:23] <NazarethSTG> it's alright, you pased the check, see every event as something bad that you need to go throught with the least damage taken
[2:19:28] <lotharrio> Equip that CAMERA
[2:19:54] <qwesta6> doom tho
[2:19:54] <+Matto424> well it's uh japan so good luck with that
[2:19:56] <%Th3SmartAlec> Good luck with that
[2:19:56] <sexdrugsvideogames> americans...
[2:19:57] <Dr_Mooose> yeah, you wish
[2:19:59] <NeroInfinite> Guns are actually not great
[2:20:00] <Valentinius_Anodyne> No gods, no masters, only GUN
[2:20:00] <MaverickJoker> does the camera go on slot b or c?
[2:20:00] <TDAWS_MP132> just go through the areas and learn for now
[2:20:02] <blackkanye> Dex means you would best use something dex related
[2:20:02] <Crombells> how you gonna get a gun in JAPAN?
[2:20:04] <ManfredA> I've only gotten a gun once
[2:20:04] <NazarethSTG> there's a store on the seaside
[2:20:04] <+kapcommunist> this game needs more super shotguns
[2:20:06] <wrydiculous> Woolie remember this is japan
[2:20:10] <+jiggy_snipe> they're canadian tho Kappa
[2:20:11] <+ItsRatman> how's a gun gonna help you shoot a ghost
[2:20:14] <MaverickJoker> ah B
[2:20:15] <RyanTheRecluse> @woolieversus There is a very small chance of getting a gun
[2:20:16] <alephalpha> if you wanted a weapon should have gone to the docks while you had money
[2:20:17] <ManfredA> they can be good @NeroInfinite but you gotta hope you get bullets
[2:20:22] <MaxXtreme23> Wow, holy shit I went to sleep and i come back to see the stream's only 2 hours in damn
[2:20:22] <Laecerelius> Raise that Dex and get a katana to Virgil all over the unknowable horrors!
[2:20:26] <Dhurkst> @sexdrugsvideogames they're canadian
[2:20:27] <MaverickJoker> wait, they do have cocaine?
[2:20:27] <blackkanye> guns are only realyl good when you have a per build. You can do way better than a gun with a weapon for your highest stat while boosting your highest stat
[2:20:29] <SuperKirby24> LUL
[2:20:35] <+lethallunacyx> Oh thank the eldritch lords
[2:20:36] <+jiggy_snipe> lol
[2:20:36] <rubbishbinge> but KATANA
[2:20:36] <wrydiculous> LUL
[2:20:37] <%Th3SmartAlec> Fair enough
[2:20:37] <TDAWS_MP132> true LUL
[2:20:42] <%Th3SmartAlec> @rubbishbinge shhhh
[2:20:43] <ManfredA> KANA
[2:20:47] <NazarethSTG> there are, but they are hard to get
[2:20:49] <lotharrio> Remember Persona 1, one of the first quests is to just get guns for everyone.
[2:20:49] <sexdrugsvideogames> as a continent maybe?
[2:20:49] <BoneofMalkav> Not to mention, this is 198X Japan LUL
[2:20:50] <blackkanye> BEST GIRL
[2:20:50] <%Th3SmartAlec> 3?
[2:20:51] <BakerBrute> KANA Pog
[2:20:53] <RyanTheRecluse> LUL
[2:20:53] <NeroInfinite> YOu won't get her if eels is active
[2:20:54] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I cannot blame Woolie for loving the gun
[2:20:54] <%GeneralSCPatton> But glorious Nippon steel folded 1000 times
[2:20:55] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[2:21:00] <startstoprepeat> neighbor button currently doesn't do anything afaik
[2:21:01] <Dr_Mooose> dang FeelsBadMan

[2:21:05] <anar_bael> allies give stat boosts or stat debuffs
[2:21:08] <Dhurkst> @sexdrugsvideogames ...no, dude. that's not how things work
[2:21:08] <wrydiculous> aww she's not home

[2:21:26] <NeroInfinite> She's out to EELS
[2:21:27] <rubbishbinge> I think
[2:21:35] <lotharrio> Oh that's an Elder Sign on her door. Kana's protected from uhh... Flying Polyps?
[2:21:35] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:21:36] <%Th3SmartAlec> Huh, that took no time
[2:21:36] <hntronium> Plus 1 dooms
[2:21:36] <Dhurkst> @sexdrugsvideogames no, they don't
[2:21:40] <Run44forrest> has anyone ever gotten check on neighbor to work?
[2:21:46] <ManfredA> lucky

[2:21:53] <Clyderso> money PogChamp
[2:21:58] <%Th3SmartAlec> Someone must have picked up that ring your dropped LUL
[2:22:01] <ManfredA> @Run44forrest it's prolly for later, Kana is acquired from a quest
[2:22:02] <MaverickJoker> cultist?
[2:22:04] <+jiggy_snipe> creepy creepy
[2:22:07] <RyuuAoi> Five confirmed cases of Covid-19 in my state. ARE WE WINNING YET?
[2:22:09] <lotharrio> You can always take a bath.
[2:22:09] <KatabolicRage> reason is more sanity than dumbness
[2:22:10] <+lethallunacyx> I mean Canadians do hunt, a LOT.
[2:22:13] <hntronium> Reason isn't smarts
[2:22:17] <+jiggy_snipe> not dumb, less sane
[2:22:24] <hntronium> Knowledge is smarts
[2:22:29] <sexdrugsvideogames> @RyuuAoi cangratulations!
[2:22:30] <MooseoneLivedhere> canadian here i love guns
[2:22:31] <GandhiTheTerrible> you're not more dumber, you're more insane
[2:22:35] <Valentinius_Anodyne> That is the best thing you could have gotten from running out of money
[2:22:45] <sexdrugsvideogames> guns are kinda cool tho
[2:22:48] <NazarethSTG> you can buy melee weapons on the seaside
[2:22:52] <sexdrugsvideogames> not gonna lie
[2:22:57] <%Th3SmartAlec> learning is happening
[2:23:02] <Midnight188> yellow sign on the poster there
[2:23:02] <MaverickJoker> bad deviantart
[2:23:03] <+Mendin> There's just the yellow sign
[2:23:03] <RyuuAoi> @sexdrugsvideogames ! Zombie Apocalypse At Risk !
[2:23:07] <Dhurkst> @lethallunacyx fair enough, but gun-loving isn't part of the culture
[2:23:08] <blackkanye> inflation Kappa
[2:23:13] <Run44forrest> @manfreda no im wondering if you can get kana outside of the eel quest
[2:23:13] <+jiggy_snipe> oops all furry
[2:23:15] <hntronium> Not dumber
[2:23:16] <+Deosier> they hitted ya with the dickbutts
[2:23:19] <Teh_Un> Duct Tape banana = Dread
[2:23:20] <wrydiculous> Oh no it's furry pron
[2:23:20] <%GeneralSCPatton> Not dumbness, SANITY
[2:23:22] <ManfredA> yeah no
[2:23:22] <MooseoneLivedhere> hentia
[2:23:28] <TDAWS_MP132> good learning so far
[2:23:31] <ManfredA> it'd break the quest
[2:23:32] <lotharrio> For a first "real" playthrough, messing around and familiarizing yourself with the basic game, expecting to die, is a good idea.
[2:23:32] <GarbageNirvana> Basically zero reason = Maximilian Roivas from Eternal Darkness
[2:23:37] <Crombells> you'd be dumber if your knowledge decreased
[2:23:37] <hntronium> Ikki Tousen was fun though
[2:23:37] <%DensityD> ok boomer weeb
[2:23:37] <YakumoYomi> Ikkitousen was alright.
[2:23:42] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Hardware store has weapons
[2:23:49] <lotharrio> Also, Woolie, you know about the comicbook DIESEL, right? The American JoJo-knockoff?
[2:23:49] <%NuclearLawlocausto> Not dumb, crazy
[2:23:51] <sexdrugsvideogames> its a lovecraft game, so you go insane
[2:23:53] <MaverickJoker> weapon store?
[2:23:55] <alephalpha> carpenter hammer even while enrfed is the shit
[2:23:55] <NazarethSTG> you can buy with that
[2:23:56] <MaverickJoker> GUNS?!
[2:23:56] <+lethallunacyx> @Dhurkst True, we love are guns to a ridiculous degree
[2:23:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> Hammer god to death
[2:24:03] <+lethallunacyx> our*
[2:24:05] <anar_bael> hardware store = melee weapons
[2:24:10] <NazarethSTG> it's enough money
[2:24:12] <NeroInfinite> HArdware store is mostly strength weapons
[2:24:13] <MaxXtreme23> carpenter hammer SO GOOD
[2:24:15] <alephalpha> carpenter hamme ris the most reliable weapon
[2:24:17] <MaverickJoker> aw
[2:24:20] <Dr_Mooose> monkaS

[2:24:25] <reonome> monkaS
[2:24:28] <laguerrilha> I couldn't continue reading Ikkitousen. That tanned girl is gorgeous, but that story is trash
[2:24:32] <MooseoneLivedhere> shark exorcist
[2:24:33] <osiris1260> Hammer got nerfed recently
[2:24:34] <%Th3SmartAlec> "Ok"
[2:24:35] <+kewlmyc> Jesus christ at option 2

[2:24:46] <+lethallunacyx> Ooo steal her knife
[2:24:52] <sexdrugsvideogames> gonna google ikkitousen now
[2:24:54] <@Solidus_113> What does the old god want
[2:24:54] <wrydiculous> roll that dice baby
[2:24:56] <ManfredA> it's a CHA check prolly
[2:24:57] <lotharrio> @Run44forrest A single issue was made that was just the Geb fight.
[2:24:58] <anar_bael> STEAL THE KNIFE TO USE DEX WEAPON
[2:24:59] <MaxXtreme23> i mean I got the game yesterday, so I don't have much perception of what it's like nerfed or not
[2:24:59] <%Th3SmartAlec> oof

[2:25:11] <Dhurkst> whoopsie-doodle
[2:25:12] <reonome> welp
[2:25:14] <wrydiculous> Has knife but jumps
[2:25:14] <Valentinius_Anodyne> At least the ocean has been fed :)
[2:25:14] <anar_bael> rip
[2:25:16] <spardanwarrior> DO A FLIP
[2:25:16] <hntronium> She gonna go crazy
[2:25:18] <SuperKirby24> LUL
[2:25:20] <xeros720> farewell reason
[2:25:20] <+jiggy_snipe> wait why have a knife if you're gonna jump?
[2:25:21] <%DensityD> but my charisma ring
[2:25:21] <hntronium> At this rate
[2:25:25] <Dhurkst> LUL
[2:25:26] <+lethallunacyx> She said foh loser
[2:25:27] <GandhiTheTerrible> 10 Reason already monkaS
[2:25:30] <sexdrugsvideogames> schoolgirls with spears?
[2:25:33] <hntronium> Too coward to use knife
[2:25:34] <%DensityD> do a flip
[2:25:38] <MaverickJoker> better than getting stabbed on fail
[2:25:39] <Crombells> because they don't want people to stop them
[2:25:40] <NeroInfinite> Do a flip
[2:25:41] <anar_bael> We ain't allies with people we stabbing or bashing like the best
[2:25:43] <qwesta6> why not both
[2:25:44] <GarbageNirvana> Plan B?
[2:25:48] <MooseoneLivedhere> bakemonogatari vibes
[2:25:48] <RyanTheRecluse> maybe wanted to die instead of jumping to old god
[2:25:48] <MaxXtreme23> also, have y'all ever hit 0 stamina but managed to bounce back thanks to the absorb spell
[2:25:49] <+skylerpilot> @WoolieVersus can't let anyone stop you Woolie
[2:25:50] <Renkage> The way I see it. Is you try to convince them. They say "GET BACK!" Or some shit. She panics, she falls off
[2:25:52] <karismaticprik> The knife is for air combo
[2:25:54] <osiris1260> Success means she gives you the knife
[2:25:54] <Dhurkst> STAB THE OCEAN
[2:25:55] <Prevot> always double tap
[2:25:55] <wrydiculous> she had step 1a but decided to go step 2a then 2b
[2:25:56] <%CSNG> Low charisma: “do a flip!”
[2:25:58] <+teg88> Stab the ocean
[2:25:59] <Dr_Mooose> making sure you don't fail
[2:26:01] <+jiggy_snipe> super suicide
[2:26:04] <lotharrio> Juggle self in air with chest knifing.
[2:26:10] <splatty1> redundancy is important Kappa
[2:26:12] <Renkage> While just letting her do it, will have her stab herself
[2:26:12] <hntronium> @MaxXtreme23 I was at -1 before I used a sewing kit to not die
[2:26:13] <+lethallunacyx> Use the floor to auto stab yourself maybe
[2:26:15] <+mczarklesby> Knife is just a cut so the sharks find you.
[2:26:16] <laguerrilha> @sexdrugsvideogames search Ikki Tousen Kanu instead, she is the onlyone that matters in that
[2:26:23] <ZeeJiggle> Just one more to add to the list of "Corpse (Nothing)"
[2:26:23] <RyanTheRecluse> that one cool death stranding moment in the trailer when the gun didn't work
[2:26:29] <TDAWS_MP132> best avoid that for now
[2:26:36] <MooseoneLivedhere> wow
[2:26:39] <MaverickJoker> nice bath
[2:26:42] <MaverickJoker> sounds good

[2:27:18] <hntronium> What a waste
[2:27:20] <MaxXtreme23> Does it game over if Doom hits 100%?
[2:27:25] <MooseoneLivedhere> end
[2:27:26] <TDAWS_MP132> check the schoolyard or library?
[2:27:28] <nothuzad> yes MaxXtreme23

[2:27:45] <BoneofMalkav> Yes, Game Over once Doom hit 100%
[2:27:45] <Crombells> wasted stamina regen, unfortunately
[2:27:47] <Dhurkst> little Metal Gears <3
[2:27:48] <Dr_Mooose> metal gear
[2:27:48] <%Th3SmartAlec> Is that a Metal Gear?!
[2:27:49] <MaxXtreme23> damn, i got mad lucky then, I beat my first run with 94% doom lol
[2:27:59] <MooseoneLivedhere> oh to a teen age japaness girl

[2:28:00] <BoneofMalkav> That is indeed a Metal Gear
[2:28:01] <sexdrugsvideogames> @laguerrilha awesome design

[2:39:28] <42nfl19> Whats the FND stat?
[2:39:29] <+zafooru> Expel Evil is basically free!
[2:39:33] <+Mendin> Funds
[2:39:33] <hntronium> @DensityD Its out, and I hear its good
[2:39:37] <%Th3SmartAlec> that is very inefficent
[2:39:37] <%GeneralSCPatton> @42nfl19 Funds
[2:39:38] <wrydiculous> expel evil is good now actually
[2:39:45] <+McSnazzyPants> expel evil and regen was the og infinite combo
[2:39:46] <NazarethSTG> careful with that doom
[2:39:55] <+jiggy_snipe> 100%
[2:39:55] <GandhiTheTerrible> spells are eldrich, almost all of them have a heavy cost
[2:39:56] <MaverickJoker> you just gain exp
[2:39:56] <%Th3SmartAlec> 100%
[2:39:58] <MaxXtreme23> 30% doom at mystery 1 lol
[2:39:58] <MaverickJoker> also doom is 100
[2:39:59] <MooseoneLivedhere> more doom for the game
[2:40:00] <Dr_Mooose> 100%
[2:40:01] <TDAWS_MP132> you're learning!!! Do whatever!
[2:40:02] <wrydiculous> 100% is game over
[2:40:04] <coracor> yeah your doom is kind of balling out of control
[2:40:04] <KatabolicRage> 100%, and it rarely goes down
[2:40:04] <Valentinius_Anodyne> If Doom go up, Reality go down
[2:40:06] <%GeneralSCPatton> Game over at 100%
[2:40:06] <+MisoPhat_> 100% is game over
[2:40:06] <@Solidus_113> Doom is basically a clock
[2:40:08] <GandhiTheTerrible> 100% = game over
[2:40:11] <MaverickJoker> but let me phrase this right: doom endings are AMAZING
[2:40:13] <hntronium> @WoolieVersus Around 15% per mystery is decent
[2:40:13] <Clyderso> If you get enough doom, SAM BRIDGES gets into smash
[2:40:16] <NazarethSTG> think that you need to do 5 cases without reaching 100%
[2:40:16] <sexdrugsvideogames> funny how theres actually a meta for this 8bit style game
[2:40:19] <rubbishbinge> 100% is game over, need to finish all 5 mysteries before you hit 100
[2:40:23] <wrydiculous> yea doom endings are sick
[2:40:28] <+Mendin> Each mystery and some random events lower doom
[2:40:29] <MooseoneLivedhere> its call Hametsu not doom
[2:40:35] <anar_bael> when health and reason reach 0 its game over, if doom gets to 100 its game over
[2:40:42] <KatabolicRage> exp is far far better then fnd
[2:40:47] <@Solidus_113> you want levels though
[2:40:47] <TDAWS_MP132> it did!
[2:40:47] <Doodle_Taco> Honestly is not worth it
[2:40:48] <xeros720> this is essentially a boardgame/ card game
[2:40:49] <KatabolicRage> you lose that 30 I beleive
[2:40:49] <lotharrio> Yeah but level up though.
[2:40:52] <hntronium> 30 xp to money is a waste tbh
[2:40:56] <MaxXtreme23> you really want levels
[2:40:56] <Valentinius_Anodyne> You want to level up tho
[2:41:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> WOOLIE
[2:41:06] <+jiggy_snipe> exchange rates Kappa
[2:41:08] <+lethallunacyx> yeah that's not worth it
[2:41:09] <Dhurkst> @sexdrugsvideogames Visual style & complexity are totally separate
[2:41:10] <NeroInfinite> 30% doom and they haven't done anything
[2:41:13] <Renkage> Because video games
[2:41:16] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Sell your memories for cold hard cash
[2:41:18] <+zafooru> Only by suffering silently do we grow?
[2:41:22] <anar_bael> its trading exp for money

[2:42:53] <sexdrugsvideogames> @Dhurkst of course. but it looks like from a pre-internet era, yet it gets updated all the time. thats a very interesting design decision
[2:42:54] <xeros720> a lot like arkham horror
[2:42:58] <MaxXtreme23> They'll never build up to anything except STE

[2:43:39] <sexdrugsvideogames> crowba yes!

[2:44:20] <hntronium> @RyanTheRecluse Not anymore
[2:44:20] <Crombells> already filled the B and C slots, only a weapon would be really useful
[2:44:25] <NazarethSTG> no, it works for some events
[2:44:27] <ShiningAxis> flashlight is a lightsource that is used in many events
[2:44:28] <wrydiculous> but it is a very good item
[2:44:31] <ShiningAxis> really good item
[2:44:34] <BoneofMalkav> Bork Bork
[2:44:37] <warmnoid> flashlight has the most utility
[2:44:38] <Dhurkst> @sexdrugsvideogames The visual style is just a reference to an older style of game. The updates aren't a design decision so much as simply being part of modern game development.
[2:44:38] <Dr_Mooose> hammer time
[2:44:39] <NeroInfinite> Get the hammer
[2:44:41] <+zafooru> Clonk!

[2:44:58] <+zafooru> Equip Hammar
[2:44:58] <TDAWS_MP132> EQUIP
[2:44:59] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Not as good as it used to be, but still decent

[2:49:11] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Prep is for first one after
[2:49:12] <lotharrio> Look at the bottom most option on offense. You can sneak one in I think
[2:49:16] <Midnight188> big miss
[2:49:21] <GarbageNirvana> "mORty...i tURNed mYSelf InTO A PickLE MOrtY..."
[2:49:22] <NazarethSTG> hammer has very low accuracy, prepare is pretty much a must
[2:49:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> so prep Strong prep reg
[2:49:43] <RyanTheRecluse> option at the bottom is a 10% bit increase
[2:49:44] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:49:48] <+McSnazzyPants> dodge prep normal is what i do 90% of the time

[3:12:57] <sexdrugsvideogames> reason go down?
[3:13:01] <Run44forrest> -3 -2 -3 dead either way
[3:13:02] <+Alicitzen> Actually super cant win now
[3:13:03] <sexdrugsvideogames> ok
[3:13:03] <arkv01> time to assume form of boomer: sacrifice all the kids
[3:13:08] <+Klonoa__> Maybe get it to 15 and under first
[3:13:08] <TDAWS_MP132> you can also forget spells to regain reason
[3:13:10] <Renkage> Single digit? No. You are doing 10
[3:13:11] <%CSNG> Defeat the monster and then immediately get arrested
[3:13:14] <rubbishbinge> dodge and pray?
[3:13:16] <+RealThiele> if she does 12 on next round after plug she wins
[3:13:17] <rubbishbinge> lel
[3:13:18] <RyanTheRecluse> you're doing a heap of damage, sacrifice an ally is your best bet
[3:13:18] <%Will9099> sacrifice 1 patient to save za warudo?
[3:13:19] <+RealThiele> but at 2 reason
[3:13:25] <xeros720> forget spells for reason like someone said

[3:13:30] <+BigBruthaThunda> you're hitting for 10!
[3:13:32] <wrydiculous> forget spells
[3:13:32] <Valentinius_Anodyne> You did 10 damage the first turn, unplug will give you too little reason to survive the encounter
[3:13:34] <+lethallunacyx> It's gonna hurt
[3:13:34] <MyNameIsRasus> Forget spells for reason
[3:13:45] <@Solidus_113> now do an attack
[3:13:46] <lotharrio> Unplug and then try to go big on the most damage you can swing in.
[3:13:48] <@Solidus_113> fill the bar
[3:13:49] <RyanTheRecluse> might lose an ally
[3:13:52] <Crombells> oh yeah, forgetting spells could save you
[3:13:54] <TDAWS_MP132> you have a chance of losing the ally. It doesn't always happen
[3:13:58] <RyanTheRecluse> so attack
[3:14:02] <DedlokPM> Sacrifice your partner for more time on the clock. woolieMIRIN
[3:14:11] <KatabolicRage> you can get 2 reason back from dumping spells in a pinch
[3:14:12] <wrydiculous> always prep that hammer
[3:14:12] <Turning2Dust> Can also unplug, take the hit, and go for desperation.

[3:19:50] <sexdrugsvideogames> cool ending tho
[3:19:51] <KatabolicRage> it was a tough fight for being as low as she was
[3:19:52] <TopTierHarley> dekillASoul
[3:19:52] <%allups> u got cut up
[3:19:54] <Prevot> it's your fault again, Woolie

[3:20:02] <C24U> @WoolieVersus You cant end combat with 0. You have to have at least 1 before it ends or you die
[3:20:03] <%GeneralSCPatton> At the cost of plot resolution
[3:20:09] <wrydiculous> woolie if the fight ENDS with 0 reason, it's a confirm game over
[3:20:12] <MaxXtreme23> If it's any consolation, your doom was at 50% at mystery 1, so the run was fucked anyway lol
[3:20:13] <%Th3SmartAlec> ....maybe if you meditated
[3:20:14] <RyanTheRecluse> so achievements unlock more items/events
[3:20:18] <Renkage> You had a lot of ways out of that. But your still new, so it's understandable
[3:20:19] <+BigBruthaThunda> meditation too risky
[3:20:22] <TopTierHarley> true Max
[3:20:22] <+paladinstarbuster> IF YOU HAD MEDITATED
[3:20:24] <MyNameIsRasus> Shoul've meditated prepped strong
[3:20:25] <weirdducks> was gonna lose anyways doom was too high
[3:20:27] <TDAWS_MP132> you can look at the full log in the menu
[3:20:28] <+Klonoa__> should have meditated and then killed it yeah
[3:20:29] <KatabolicRage> but hey you can try a custom run this time maybe? where you actually select your character n stuff
[3:20:32] <%Th3SmartAlec> too risky when you were going to win
[3:20:35] <+McSnazzyPants> meditate would've saved you
[3:20:38] <Prevot> that log thing is way too confusing
[3:20:40] <Sundaysmiles01> Instead of caps, we'll trade TP
[3:20:41] <BoneofMalkav> Achievements also unlock more items and even playable characters and allies too
[3:20:42] <Rhinoprotoss> [warning]
[3:20:42] <Renkage> Coulda meditated. Coulda also did the desperate struggle and did 20 damage
[3:20:46] <lotharrio> Mostly just accept that you're gonna lose a lot early on. Like most roguelikes.
[3:20:47] <MaxXtreme23> @BigBruthaThunda at the last turn, meditation wasn't risky because he could've still killed it with a prep and strong attack
[3:20:52] <Nekros4442> Death's Door Woolie
[3:20:54] <@Solidus_113> Reason, not life
[3:21:02] <xxmagonx> !uptime
[3:21:02] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 21 minutes
[3:21:02] <C24U> It's a chance to recover
[3:21:02] <+McSnazzyPants> in the you menu there's a full log button
[3:21:03] <MyNameIsRasus> It was reason
[3:21:04] <+BigBruthaThunda> I was being sarcastic
[3:21:07] <Dr_Mooose> get one last shot
[3:21:07] <Run44forrest> UNO MAS
[3:21:09] <KatabolicRage> if you can fenangle it or maybe use an item you can pull yourself out of it
[3:21:10] <Doodle_Taco> Death's Door
[3:21:11] <+Alicitzen> Its so you can recover, battle doesnt end even if you go to negatives
[3:21:12] <+BigBruthaThunda> obviously need to mediation ffs
[3:21:12] <+RealThiele> haha one more
[3:21:13] <+zafooru> Die Hardman
[3:21:20] <%AlteisenReiseZ> It's Last Stand
[3:21:24] <+RealThiele> *stares at Flagellant*
[3:21:29] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah, it's a lot like that
[3:21:31] <%Th3SmartAlec> @BigBruthaThunda Too risky to heal before winning tho
[3:21:32] <mashuubosch> !uptime
[3:21:32] <MaxXtreme23> Death's door isn't one more hit, it's a random chance on if any future hit will kill you
[3:21:32] <+Alicitzen> You can live ages at negatives
[3:21:32] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 21 minutes
[3:21:33] <rubbishbinge> Meditation would've put you at 1 Stamina and 1 Reason
[3:21:33] <RyanTheRecluse> so sometimes you can heal and other times you might get enough xp to level up and heal straight away
[3:21:47] <+BigBruthaThunda> you didn't win
[3:21:51] <Rhinoprotoss> Confusing?
[3:21:53] <+HDmexiqtioner> Spooky
[3:21:53] <Nekros4442> Basically if you could heal to 1 and kill the boss in the same turn you would've lived
[3:22:00] <Renkage> Encounter meant event. I can see why that could be confusing
[3:22:01] <+Alicitzen> next encounter means fight/scene
[3:22:15] <powerprotoman> you didnt beat it
[3:22:17] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie going 'lalala'
[3:22:17] <+McSnazzyPants> next ENCOUNTER not next TURN
[3:22:23] <TopTierHarley> you didn't beat it
[3:22:23] <KatabolicRage> the important thing is to not be at zero when it ends, you can get super wrecked into negatives
[3:22:23] <keyworthe> you didn't beat shbit
[3:22:26] <%allups> u got an end u beat it
[3:22:27] <+jiggy_snipe> you lost your sanity
[3:22:27] <keyworthe> you just lost
[3:22:28] <lotharrio> Wasn't a proper ending but you did beat the boss.
[3:22:30] <laguerrilha> F
[3:22:33] <keyworthe> you lost my dude
[3:22:36] <@Solidus_113> Now quickly check out the customize options @WoolieVersus
[3:22:41] <%Th3SmartAlec> "You've perished" Woolie: "I did it!"
[3:22:42] <powerprotoman> you gameovered
[3:22:42] <@Solidus_113> custom run*
[3:22:46] <Sundaysmiles01> Junji does need more love after the whole PT debacle
[3:22:52] <weirdducks> there was more you lost the first case
[3:22:59] <sexdrugsvideogames> he doesnt get mad, so he actually lost twice!
[3:23:00] <+lethallunacyx> You got your charcter "beat" to death
[3:23:01] <Run44forrest> @woolieversus check out 2bit and custom run
[3:23:02] <Sundaysmiles01> that was such a loss for all of us
[3:23:13] <%allups> LUL @sexdrugsvideogames
[3:23:16] <@Solidus_113> !uptime
[3:23:16] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 23 minutes
[3:23:17] <+McSnazzyPants> my reason kept dropping watching this stream
[3:23:24] <TopTierHarley> lol

[3:23:31] <+jiggy_snipe> @sexdrugsvideogames i just got that lol
[3:23:37] <powerprotoman> Woolie "sanity at risk" madden
[3:23:42] <%GeneralSCPatton> Keep going
[3:23:53] <sexdrugsvideogames> that car!
[3:23:54] <DedlokPM> DEJA VU
[3:23:56] <KatabolicRage> the goal of the game is to do 5 mysteries without hitting 100 doom or eating shit
[3:23:58] <SuperKirby24> DEJA VU
[3:24:11] <KatabolicRage> eh, broadly speaking
[3:24:12] <RyanTheRecluse> each run is 5 mysteries from a pool of 12
[3:24:14] <powerprotoman> woolie dying on the tutorial "i won right?"
[3:24:17] <nothuzad> would be cool if you looked at the start up of option 3
[3:24:21] <TopTierHarley> it doesn't count as solved since you game overed
[3:24:28] <Renkage> Hope he continues with this game. He didn't even get close to beating it
[3:24:43] <+HDmexiqtioner> Hello Woolie and Punch Mom
[3:24:43] <+zafooru> Darkness! Imprisoning me!
[3:24:53] <sexdrugsvideogames> but they do get an ending number, right?
[3:24:53] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1239789488349614081?s=20
[3:24:54] <+HDmexiqtioner> You'll enjoy the mystery game announcement
[3:25:00] <rubbishbinge> all 5 mysteries need to be solved in the 100 doom
[3:25:02] <Run44forrest> @woolieversus custom run PogChamp
[3:25:17] <anar_bael> that was rough but first runs are always rough
[3:25:28] <Timesteel> if you have questions about the game I recommend talking to Pat next time you do the podcast
[3:25:29] <Laironx3> weeb cthulhu
[3:25:30] <Sundaysmiles01> Twas fun to watch, I love me some eldritch horror
[3:25:30] <TopTierHarley> nah my first run was fine lol
[3:25:31] <Prevot> Cthulhu-chan
[3:25:39] <Renkage> Once you understand the game. You can win multiple times in a row
[3:25:49] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Can't wait for custom campaigns soon
[3:25:53] <Sarl109> @WoolieVersus every new session is made of 5 random cases, you need to solve all 5 before Doom reaches 100
[3:25:56] <%optimasmaximas> does anyone know what "Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045" on netflix mean? new movie?
[3:25:59] <Renkage> Like. The game straight up has a meta.
[3:26:00] <sexdrugsvideogames> yeah, also on stream
[3:26:03] <+jiggy_snipe> it was a learning session
[3:26:08] <+lethallunacyx> It's certainly a learning experience
[3:26:10] <%Binary_Fireball> Discover strategize smoke dannk
[3:26:12] <KatabolicRage> if you have time y ou should try doing a custom run
[3:26:15] <nothuzad> just the start of a "real" ru would be nice
[3:26:18] <Sundaysmiles01> I'm game for another run if you are
[3:26:19] <+Alicitzen> If you can understand an eldritch horror then its not really eldritch
[3:26:20] <Rhinoprotoss> With the rate you're going you can start and die just in time
[3:26:23] <sexdrugsvideogames> stand alone complex was a series, right?
[3:26:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> @optimasmaximas New movie. And they insist on loli Major
[3:26:27] <keyworthe> why not
[3:26:31] <Prevot> maybe if you take the controls it can go faster
[3:26:33] <presque> I think you sound tired
[3:26:34] <keyworthe> you got stuff going on?
[3:26:41] <pi_in_the_sci> This is why blind playthroughs are good.
[3:26:43] <Timesteel> a full run can be a little long if it’s your first time doing the mysteries
[3:26:51] <arkv01> dw, up to how punchmom feels
[3:26:56] <keyworthe> coroner virus is about, just stay at home my dude and play the video gamus
[3:27:01] <%optimasmaximas> @Th3SmartAlec oh...guess its not a good time to get in to ghost in the shell? LUL
[3:27:04] <+jiggy_snipe> 11pm
[3:27:19] <Sundaysmiles01> hell yeah!
[3:27:20] <+projectmanatees> what if woolie did a run this time
[3:27:22] <Crombells> @WoolieVersus You can settle for one mystery, shouldn't take nearly as long as the first time
[3:27:23] <%optimasmaximas> yeyeye
[3:27:28] <Renkage> Woolie in the driver seat this time? Change things up?
[3:27:30] <Dr_Mooose> speedrun
[3:27:31] <%RioGascar> Could do bumbo
[3:27:34] <%allups> WIN or DIE
[3:27:35] <MaverickJoker> i'd like to see punch mom and woolie get somewhere past tutorial
[3:27:55] <0rond> life is cheap
[3:27:56] <Sundaysmiles01> I love that kirby lamp
[3:28:01] <powerprotoman> woolies got zero survival instinct
[3:28:04] <TopTierHarley> don't explore everything
[3:28:10] <%GeneralSCPatton> Just don't do World of Snail
[3:28:14] <Timesteel> Ya I didn’t beat it until like my 5th run
[3:28:17] <%Th3SmartAlec> @optimasmaximas Just watch the first animated movie and SAC. And that's itm because Arise started the 'but what if she was a little girl tho'
[3:28:18] <+max_byer> Running is your friend
[3:28:18] <TopTierHarley> no way your Doom was 50+ one mystery 1 lol
[3:28:20] <Dr_Mooose> each run is a learning opportunity
[3:28:27] <%Th3SmartAlec> You can also customize your colors
[3:28:41] <Ne0classical> They had a 50 doom mystery one
[3:28:47] <%Th3SmartAlec> huh
[3:28:49] <weirdducks> each run is 5 mysteries
[3:28:49] <%allups> life is fast and cheap is junji ito world
[3:28:52] <Crombells> running is for cowards that cannot wield a hammer good
[3:28:55] <TopTierHarley> I really can't believe it Neo
[3:28:57] <Sundaysmiles01> school scissors? Kinky....
[3:29:11] <0rond> alt+F4
[3:29:13] <Ne0classical> They spent like half the mystery just doing things

[3:46:09] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1239789488349614081?s=20
[3:46:10] <$razielhex> razielhex subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Happy 5 year anniversary since PAX when Woolie fought and lost against the Great Black Otaku!
[3:46:11] <Ne0classical> Its really not worth it, just do the missions...
[3:46:11] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Well, not necessarily worth it. The Doom was really high
[3:46:16] <%bread_assassin> Ya don't want to raise DOOM too much. Wasting 50 doom on the first mystery is a recipe for disaster.
[3:46:36] <Ozavic> They're getting it!
[3:46:45] <%razielhex> Raise all DOOM and unlock DOOMGUY
[3:46:50] <%Th3SmartAlec> uh oh
[3:46:51] <wrydiculous> oh no
[3:46:54] <wrydiculous> run
[3:46:59] <wrydiculous> or improv
[3:46:59] <powerprotoman> running
[3:47:05] <%AlteisenReiseZ> You can run too
[3:47:11] <lotharrio> THrow a defense in with this.

[3:47:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> thats nice
[3:47:27] <Renkage> When it down. You can also be a giant coward
[3:47:41] <+Mendin> Spidergod stops running.
[3:47:41] <%Th3SmartAlec> That was locked last run
[3:47:44] <rubbishbinge> dex ;-;
[3:47:45] <+jiggy_snipe> your rule set is Rest = DOOM
[3:47:45] <Run44forrest> pretty good
[3:47:51] <wrydiculous> take her one she weak

[3:48:04] <Sundaysmiles01> .... why are japanese ghosts hot... I'd suck as an exorcist in nippon land
[3:48:11] <Renkage> This is a game of math. Know how much damage you do and they do. Damage rarely changes
[3:48:13] <lotharrio> That's a big assume, Woolie.
[3:48:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> IT DOES NOT

[3:49:19] <@Solidus_113> what's the hit rate of your bottle
[3:49:29] <@Solidus_113> it could be cheaper than guarantee
[3:49:35] <+mankeyfigh> Ah this filter
[3:49:37] <nothuzad> 70%
[3:49:43] <rubbishbinge> 4 dmg on strong attack oof
[3:49:46] <powerprotoman> remove the piss pallet
[3:49:47] <Crombells> Solidus has the right idea
[3:49:51] <Valentinius_Anodyne> what about regular attack?
[3:49:52] <Teh_Un> Scream back at her
[3:50:04] <lotharrio> See what your accuracy on the bottle is. Maybe aim+regular will let you do more damage per turn
[3:50:07] <TalisKanju> Whoa what is this game
[3:50:11] <%razielhex> Get the Grimaldi Classic Baby Jesus!
[3:50:27] <%razielhex> Uuuuwaaaaaaaaagh
[3:50:31] <sexdrugsvideogames> you need to meditate?
[3:50:36] <Sundaysmiles01> kyaaaaahhh
[3:50:59] <sexdrugsvideogames> can you heal off battle?
[3:51:08] <Prevot> jelly skelly
[3:51:09] <%Th3SmartAlec> Wait, to be clear, does the character always attack first?
[3:51:19] <+mankeyfigh> There are very few ways to heal in this game
[3:51:21] <Shion963> elongated arms and jellified bones, huh 🤔
[3:51:21] <Run44forrest> yes
[3:51:22] <lotharrio> The PC always seems to attack first.
[3:51:34] <sexdrugsvideogames> they are at 2hp now...
[3:51:42] <@Solidus_113> you do have higher str
[3:51:47] <%razielhex> It's thje Police Chief from Last Action Hero, or, probably, Japanese Carl WInslowe
[3:51:47] <TalisKanju> !uptime
[3:51:48] <Renkage> And yes. The character can heal by resting in home. Cost doom though. Doom=100% you lose
[3:51:48] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 51 minutes
[3:52:12] <Prevot> become shovel knight
[3:52:15] <illTemperedSeaBass> 120 speed seems crippling to me.
[3:52:16] <lotharrio> Make sure you equip that shovel.
[3:52:18] <KatabolicRage> remmember that investigating circled locations advances the story text up top on the map screen
[3:52:20] <rubbishbinge> speed tho
[3:52:21] <weirdducks> takes more time to swing
[3:52:21] <@Solidus_113> and sell the bottle
[3:52:24] <Crombells> @WoolieVersus Lower speed is better
[3:52:28] <illTemperedSeaBass> ↑
[3:52:32] <wrydiculous> speed go down shovel go up
[3:52:36] <NeroInfinite> Sell the bottle
[3:52:40] <Run44forrest> rest lets you heal at the cost of doom. theres some items and spells that heal you but they also have their downsides
[3:52:41] <sexdrugsvideogames> you can sell the broken bottle?
[3:52:43] <Ne0classical> Equip shovel

[4:00:36] <KatabolicRage> resting is extra doomy with this god
[4:00:38] <Sundaysmiles01> its why they're there
[4:00:38] <+jiggy_snipe> remember REST = DOOM
[4:00:45] <yoshkosh20> stickin your head through doggy doors. a power move used by only the best salesmen.
[4:00:50] <NeroInfinite> rest means more doom
[4:00:53] <%Parapattern> I am small and flexible enough to get though the average doggy door
[4:00:55] <%razielhex> @PsychedelicSnake Hold on, let me get my copy of "Angels with Filthy Souls"
[4:00:59] <wrydiculous> ohhh so you say
[4:01:02] <KatabolicRage> you gotta do 5 entire mysteries with your ONE doom bar
[4:01:03] <+jiggy_snipe> 100% DOOM gameover
[4:01:03] <@Solidus_113> Doom is a clock
[4:01:03] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Goizo "Oh word?"
[4:01:04] <PsychedelicSnake> Eldritch horrors love pantsu
[4:01:06] <%GeneralSCPatton> 100% IS GAME OVER
[4:01:07] <powerprotoman> when it hits 100 you lose
[4:01:08] <+mankeyfigh> Stop
[4:01:10] <CobaltPhoenix27> doom never resets
[4:01:10] <yoshkosh20> @Parapattern get outta here sadako
[4:01:14] <wrydiculous> doom lasts for all 5 mysteries
[4:01:16] <rubbishbinge> Game over
[4:01:18] <powerprotoman> do you whats your doom at woolie
[4:01:19] <+mankeyfigh> Then you run
[4:01:22] <Dr_Mooose> that's what they all say
[4:01:22] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie there's 5 cases
[4:01:23] <+jiggy_snipe> you have 5 cases tho :)
[4:01:27] <+vaporousTippler> Have just a little doom, as a treat.
[4:01:29] <%razielhex> She's got GOUT
[4:01:30] <C24U> You are at 28% with no finished investigations
[4:01:32] <PsychedelicSnake> Pale yellow is hot
[4:01:33] <nothuzad> doom doesnt reset - the meter counts for ALL 5 cases + end
[4:01:36] <%GeneralSCPatton> YOUR BUDGET IS UNDER 20 PER MYSTERY
[4:01:37] <%bread_assassin> You gotta make 100 doom last 5 mysteries.
[4:01:38] <NeroInfinite> woolie there are five cases
[4:01:38] <+jiggy_snipe> pale yellow huh
[4:01:38] <%razielhex> GOUT.. GO UP
[4:01:45] <hntronium> last time you were hitting 40% before the first mystery was even over, you were going to fail that run
[4:01:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie: "5 x 50% < 100%"
[4:01:48] <sexdrugsvideogames> he doesnt hear you guys
[4:01:48] <PsychedelicSnake> Bitchass ghost painting
[4:01:49] <Sundaysmiles01> delicious XP
[4:02:00] <lotharrio> XP=100 seems to be a level.

[4:02:12] <damienlunas> how come I can't see their doom percentage
[4:02:13] <%GeneralSCPatton> @sexdrugsvideogames Like Paige, he rejects the concept of information.
[4:02:22] <sexdrugsvideogames> its like shouting at a character in a horror movie in the cinema

[4:03:47] <Renkage> The stalker causes an injury every single attack. He can fuck up runs imo
[4:03:48] <Run44forrest> you have 8 turns to kill him
[4:03:56] <PsychedelicSnake> OPPAI
[4:03:56] <powerprotoman> my favorite part aboutt his is woolie saying "we dont need to worry about doom right now" when you cant actually see how much doom you have

[4:05:09] <+PapaGravestone> tobiasWUT
[4:05:17] <damienlunas> Rainbow Mountain Blend is the best flavor of boss coffee full stop.
[4:05:20] <lotharrio> Pursue mystery.
[4:05:22] <hntronium> how long till they rest again
[4:05:24] <Run44forrest> mm blood
[4:05:26] <hntronium> oh wait never mind
[4:05:28] <Blastotron> But was it refreshing blood at least?

[4:05:47] <KatabolicRage> 42% at mystery 1 out of 5, oof
[4:05:50] <SuperKirby24> how much doom are they at Kappa
[4:05:51] <Ner234> LUL Oh boy
[4:05:51] <Turning2Dust> We out here, chillin' at home, lettin' the world end, like real heroes
[4:05:52] <Renkage> If they somehow win with 40+ doom...
[4:05:52] <+jiggy_snipe> I doubt the PC is sleeping cuz of low Reason
[4:05:53] <rubbishbinge> its not a little bit of doom ;-;
[4:05:53] <hntronium> what a waste of staina
[4:05:56] <+FrenchTact1cs> $2 allready, lort
[4:05:56] <sexdrugsvideogames> @damienlunas is that a reference to blue mountain coffee?
[4:05:59] <Ner234> YES
[4:06:03] <hntronium> Yes
[4:06:04] <%AlteisenReiseZ> YES
[4:06:05] <+paladinstarbuster> YES
[4:06:05] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yes
[4:06:07] <SuperKirby24> YES
[4:06:08] <BestTeaMaker> yes
[4:06:08] <+mankeyfigh> Woolie dont lie to her like that
[4:06:10] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> You become Rip and Tear
[4:06:10] <ComfyFox> there's a character later, that profits from DOOM
[4:06:12] <wrydiculous> I wanna see the reaction when they learn that doom lasts for the whole 5 cases
[4:06:12] <KatabolicRage> the problem is your doom does not go down between mysteries
[4:06:12] <C24U> The final event giveS TONS of Doom back to back
[4:06:15] <@Solidus_113> Almost everything you do makes doom go up
[4:06:19] <+paladinstarbuster> YOU HAVE 5 QUESTS
[4:06:21] <damienlunas> I think it's unrelated
[4:06:25] <BestTeaMaker> doom is your timer
[4:06:29] <illTemperedSeaBass> "Let's pick the god that gets super-powered when we rest... Now let's rest all the time."
[4:06:29] <Iam_Dead> you have to go through 5 mysteries
[4:06:30] <+jiggy_snipe> your DOOM increases as you go through the game
[4:06:30] <Turning2Dust> The Old god influences the town at different doom thresholds.
[4:06:32] <BestTeaMaker> to finish all 5
[4:06:32] <lotharrio> @WoolieVersus It will increase the difficulty, and you can't complete the game with doom too high. Gotta do 5 mysteries.
[4:06:35] <BoneofMalkav> LUL
[4:06:36] <powerprotoman> woolie you need to do 5 of these cases with the same doom meter
[4:06:37] <SuperKirby24> DOOM CARRIES OVER BETWEEN CASES
[4:06:42] <+mankeyfigh> Doom climbs every time you investigate Woolie
[4:06:45] <+FrenchTact1cs> dude is taking Ls left and right
[4:06:48] <CobaltPhoenix27> doom doesnt reset, it rarely goes down, everythung
[4:06:48] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Big brain strats
[4:06:58] <CobaltPhoenix27> everything makes it go up
[4:06:59] <Run44forrest> @woolieversus every event is 1% doom on top of whatever happens
[4:07:09] <hntronium> 1/5
[4:07:11] <Sundaysmiles01> kek
[4:07:13] <NeroInfinite> Yep

[4:07:42] <C24U> Less than 20% per case because you need some to spare for final case
[4:07:43] <%Th3SmartAlec> Here's how you avoid doom: don't explore all over
[4:07:45] <Renkage> Uhh
[4:07:46] <NeroInfinite> LUL
[4:07:47] <Valentinius_Anodyne> You get a little back when you complete a mystery, but ya gotta be prudent

[4:11:53] <wrydiculous> millipedes are chillest
[4:11:53] <lotharrio> Centipedes bite, that's the difference.
[4:11:53] <%Th3SmartAlec> You... did it
[4:11:56] <Prevot> millipedes can't even bite you
[4:11:57] <BoneofMalkav> "He looks stuck." He looks dead! mricarShock

[4:23:09] <hntronium> FUCK THEY WERE LUCKY
[4:23:36] <YakumoYomi> Yeah, they got the Yamato and wrecked shop
[4:23:39] <SuperKirby24> So is rng normally fucked on world of horror
[4:23:43] <%razielhex> Pat got a Katana and attacked 4x per round
[4:23:46] <NeroInfinite> Yes
[4:24:04] <wrydiculous> They literally judgement cut their way to victory
[4:24:18] <hntronium> Dex God Swim Captain is great
[4:24:28] <Shion963> absolute luck can happen
[4:24:29] <TalisKanju> End of stream?
[4:24:37] <Sundaysmiles01> Will you get ambitious for a full 1 to 100 percent run?
[4:24:44] <ComfyFox> MOOD
[4:25:01] <RyuuAoi> Whens Mahvel with Punch Mom? Now?!
[4:25:15] <%DensityD> woolieWHENS
[4:25:17] <lotharrio> @Dhurkst The series I'm thinking of is called Fuan no Tane. I find it much scarier than anything Ito has done.
[4:25:33] <%razielhex> dr-r-r-r-r-r-r-r
[4:25:35] <@Solidus_113> But the scissor girl
[4:25:39] <%razielhex> arms get longer
[4:25:43] <YakumoYomi> Punch Mom vs Dreamland, let's go!
[4:25:44] <Shion963> there are ghosts that you can't hit with attacks
[4:25:47] <DedlokPM> #HaveAGhostHauntWoolieForNoMoreThanFourMonths
[4:25:53] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> dammit Woolie again with no selling ghosts
[4:25:56] <wrydiculous> Fuan no tane creeps me out more than junji ito tbh
[4:25:56] <%razielhex> BNG
[4:25:57] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @Dhurkst
[4:26:11] <YakumoYomi> @DedlokPM Nice throwback
[4:26:14] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Fuan no Tane and PTSD Radio is great
[4:26:16] <%EldritchBee> worst part abt no more shitstorms is the lack of woolies yearly haunting
[4:26:17] <Sundaysmiles01> MAXIMUM MAILBOX BULGE
[4:26:36] <Dhurkst> @lotharrio if you dont get Ito, check out 15:38 / 22:52 How Media Scares Us: The Work of Junji Ito by Super Eyepatch Wolf
[4:26:44] <Shion963> fuan no tane yo
[4:26:51] <RyuuAoi> Woolie Vs. Punch Mo Vs. SMASH LEGGO
[4:27:04] <Dhurkst> @lotharrio ignore timestamp, just a copypaste error
[4:27:04] <lotharrio> Eh. I've read a lot of Ito. I think Fuan no Tane is like... a dozen times better.
[4:27:12] <lotharrio> Gotcha-gotcha.
[4:27:15] <%razielhex> @EldritchBee FOR THE SIN... of PREMARITAL SEX
[4:27:19] <powerprotoman> looking forward to punchmoms full lp of animal crossing new horizons

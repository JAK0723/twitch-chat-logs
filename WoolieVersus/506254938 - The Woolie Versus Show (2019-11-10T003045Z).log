[0:23:02] <gappy22> Holy shit youve never played witcher 3?
[0:23:06] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Woolie!
[0:23:09] <zecht89> ace combat osts are amazing
[0:23:15] <moridin6> @Retrash god i hope he does it
[0:23:16] <worldbrand> knowing everything we know about woolie, why is that surprising?
[0:23:18] <valriot> FFXIV???
[0:23:19] <Dragon_Batman> I don't think Wool will ever
[0:23:21] <+DesertPenguin> So? They take a lot of time
[0:23:24] <+profanityincluded> woolie has been teasing it for years tho
[0:23:27] <VJdarkworld> Witcher3 ost even better ingame since its dynamic
[0:23:27] <GingaNZ> they are mad long
[0:23:29] <mexicansunglasses> witcher3 is the most overrated game of all time
[0:23:30] <DonatelloJose> Just play witcher 3
[0:23:30] <+blastazoid26> Hey Woolz, hey punchmom
[0:23:31] <wondersloth07> dustforce had a great soundtrack
[0:23:32] <Cptn_Turtle> You can start at 3
[0:23:32] <+DesertPenguin> Hey @WoolieVersus it's my birthday!
[0:23:34] <MildlyNuclear> enter the lore hole
[0:23:37] <northsouthmiddledakota> Ther is only one. the third one
[0:23:39] <%HDmexiqtioner> Just do it.
[0:23:39] <Ashenik1> Woolie the witcher 3 is the best to start with
[0:23:39] <simulationbard> Witcher 1 best Witcher Kappa
[0:23:42] <moridin6> more and more people are LPing it and i want to see these Boys do it lol
[0:23:42] <Tha_Mik> witcher 1 sucks

[0:23:51] <%HDmexiqtioner> author
[0:23:53] <+Troispoint> don't bother with Witcher 1
[0:23:54] <Dragon_Batman> 2 is really good but if anything just do 3
[0:23:55] <+funny2allways> hi woolie
[0:23:55] <tigerfang86> the Mat Pat Category lol
[0:23:58] <worldbrand> W1 is a jank ass computer rpg for crazy people
[0:24:00] <+Javaa01> I mean, you should just start at 3, Witcher 1 is HARD Eurojank and 2 is still sorta archaic
[0:24:01] <gappy22> ignore 1, 2 AND 3, Just play the Qwent spinoff
[0:24:03] <jerree66> It takes a lot to dive in too

[1:41:08] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus just load the first save and don't fight the spider
[1:41:10] <GarbageQueenEllie> maybe punch it while your light is on it
[1:41:11] <hntronium> Maybe you should restart or reload a save where you have more health
[1:41:12] <dukenux> its a Stand with a MININAL range.
[1:41:12] <%sileo_patronus> walking backwards is also an option
[1:41:15] <Shishi1205> do not punch
[1:41:18] <+profanityincluded> juke it around the room like you were doin
[1:41:19] <TheArrow_> just shun goku satsu the spider
[1:41:23] <dukenux> what is up with that

[1:41:48] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @mayorrev
[1:41:50] <mooselooseinthehoose> what game is this?
[1:41:52] <iswearimjustdandy> Bob n weave, bob n weave
[1:41:54] <+profanityincluded> spider BEFORE toilet
[1:42:00] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus it's out of your reach
[1:42:03] <%sileo_patronus> no
[1:42:03] <speximillian> Maybe trap it by the door?
[1:42:06] <trashcansan> oh god i hope not
[1:42:07] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> No
[1:42:07] <hntronium> @mooselooseinthehoose The Myster of Castle Superbeast
[1:42:09] <dukenux> softlocked?
[1:42:10] <+DigbyMayor> Trap it by the door
[1:42:13] <hntronium> Mystery*
[1:42:14] <floralkami> @maskofmichael wouldn't be the weirdest out of context quote
[1:42:14] <Jack_of_No_Trades> You need to scare him into the opposite corner, near the door
[1:42:14] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> There are more Health Potions
[1:42:15] <+QueequegTheater> Reload the first save and don't fight the spider
[1:42:17] <Agami23> you barely did anything
[1:42:20] <+amurter19> Speedrun it
[1:42:21] <Finakala> Yeah you can push it around to nearer the entrance
[1:42:22] <PlumpPotatoRump> it wouldnt take too long because u know what to do
[1:42:23] <Cozy90> get a wlife woolie!
[1:42:24] <Mendin> Speedrun!
[1:42:25] <hntronium> You are in fact doing it the hard way
[1:42:26] <floralkami> You need a tonic...
[1:42:27] <Fujiwara_92> you can do it Woolz, just juke it to the other side of the room
[1:42:34] <+frobeards> it is possible to zone the spider, but it's a bit tricky.
[1:42:36] <dukenux> jermaPluto je
[1:42:39] <+winds_0f_change> use th light to move the spider to the other side if the room
[1:42:41] <galabuddy> @WoolieVersus kite the spider towards the door?
[1:42:41] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Kite the spider away, point the light at it while you're interacting, doable
[1:42:44] <mooselooseinthehoose> hntronium thanks
[1:42:44] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[1:43:01] <Jetsfantasy> Try to get the spider by the door, then use the enviornment to block him off
[1:43:08] <hntronium> You can do that
[1:43:09] <$cureneckbeard> Woolie figured it out
[1:43:10] <+TopTieramisu> have you tried licking the spider for inspiration?
[1:43:10] <KaiserMario> NANI
[1:43:11] <floralkami> 30mins in, already softlocked through your own hubris.....
[1:43:11] <+DigbyMayor> You were so close

[1:43:20] <Jack_of_No_Trades> twirl that tank like a figure skater
[1:43:21] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus the only thing you need from the first save is the key and flashlight
[1:43:23] <iswearimjustdandy> Just come back later
[1:43:23] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> @WoolieVersus Theres another door in the room before the bathroom (4 doors)
[1:43:25] <speximillian> Can't you back up at all?
[1:43:26] <+QueequegTheater> You can speedrun
[1:43:32] <%maskofmichael> Just restart the whole game at this points
[1:43:38] <Hellarussian> I SEENT IY
[1:43:43] <joylent_blue> hoisted by your own petard
[1:43:51] <VJdarkworld> this is Woolie Must Die difficulty , only 1 HP
[1:44:19] <MyNameIsRasus> Btw, what's WR in this game's any%?
[1:44:22] <Shishi1205> you might want to use something on the toilet
[1:44:25] <speximillian> Can you jump in the tub?
[1:44:26] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Jump in the bathtube?
[1:44:26] <Aldsan> No need to restart. Just don't get hit.
[1:44:37] <Jontman42> Now if only you could strafe

[1:45:05] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Jump on the Bath Tube
[1:45:05] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus You can totally do it, but keep tha light on her, even while reading
[1:45:09] <SomersaultJustice> is there a way to get more health?
[1:45:10] <Smart_ZaK1> The spider is OP
[1:45:12] <hntronium> If only you had more health more like
[1:45:13] <dukenux> that would be a TERRYFYING mechanic
[1:45:15] <$cureneckbeard> try big jump
[1:45:15] <Zehdre> Woolie doesn't know how to walk sideways.
[1:45:17] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus if you load the first save you can get back to this point in like 5 minutes max
[1:45:27] <MisterVantes> You can kill it you just need more health and a weapon
[1:45:30] <Jack_of_No_Trades> if only the controls werent the worst possible for this maneuver
[1:45:39] <@Squdnate> @mayorrev You can post the clip again if you want, updated so now Moobot shouldn't be up your ass about it :P

[1:48:21] <%jinking79> hard backdown
[1:48:23] <+primax104> woolie wants to play DMC when he is actually playing RE
[1:48:26] <%wolfofsound> nothing wastes time more than having fun
[1:48:28] <OldOnyx> fun is a waste of time
[1:48:29] <+profanityincluded> its a survival horror game woolie
[1:48:32] <hntronium> Woolie hates this just like how he'll hate Death Stranding
[1:48:33] <ChrisM341> Spider Banned at Evo
[1:48:43] <+QueequegTheater> Woolie you need to get into RE2 mode
[1:48:44] <SquigglyLizard> yeyeye
[1:48:47] <vierleger> Yeyeye
[1:48:54] <nichos7> He says he liked what he's played of Death Stranding
[1:48:55] <iswearimjustdandy> @hntronium he already played ds, said he liked it
[1:49:01] <Jack_of_No_Trades> STOP EnJoying yourself
[1:49:07] <+profanityincluded> Spiders rise up
[1:49:16] <Jontman42> do you think games are silly little things?
[1:49:18] <Conyst> Nothing wastes time like trying tosave time.
[1:49:18] <dukenux> theres something perverse as making Woolie the protagonist of a game from the genre Pat specifically likes
[1:49:20] <floralkami> Woolie tried to fuck around and life said "No"
[1:49:22] <+QueequegTheater> arthropods live in a society
[1:49:28] <dukenux> *in
[1:49:37] <GarbageQueenEllie> run into that red thing for lp funsies
[1:49:39] <+NarcissistCactus> tank controls in a nutshell
[1:49:39] <%jinking79> If it a Ghost Spider fuck everything
[1:49:42] <%GraceTBM> the controls are a stylistic choice
[1:49:43] <vierleger> Well, Pat can't be the hero. He's the monster.
[1:49:48] <Bigyin396> I love this Woolie Shuffle the model is doing when it walks
[1:49:48] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:49:53] <+Darren716> Congrats woolie you figured out survival horror
[1:49:57] <MyNameIsRasus> Remerei should make a character action game next and make Pat the protagonist
[1:49:57] <+OwlLightningMage> Destroy your society. Buster to the heavens.
[1:50:00] <Cozy90> Tank controls are great woolie. I wish real life had tank controls
[1:50:05] <$cureneckbeard> Pat would be unable to jump as high due to his short legs
[1:50:09] <%jinking79> oh shit i feel bad for Minh now
[1:50:17] <GarbageQueenEllie> @MyNameIsRasus The irony alone would be great
[1:50:20] <dukenux> so a SH rust dimension
[1:50:25] <+doc_ock_rokc> Punchmom scared me with the mucus cloud
[1:50:29] <Doppelganger4827> there's a movie called Big A$$ Spiders
[1:50:32] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus How accurate is that run animation?
[1:50:34] <Jack_of_No_Trades> I am a dead man then
[1:50:45] <dukenux> yeah but what if your foot get stuck!
[1:50:45] <+profanityincluded> now dont fuck up getting the firepoker, and we are good
[1:50:50] <floralkami> Can you not strafe with tank controls? I could've sworn that was the whole point
[1:50:59] <poweredscoot> I mean, tripping happens at the worst times
[1:51:05] <tangoragahn> If only it were a world where monsters rule
[1:51:06] <GarbageQueenEllie> Now you gonna crush it
[1:51:09] <%GraceTBM> floralking that's a hundred percent the opposit
[1:51:15] <dukenux> it always happens in the horror
[1:51:18] <ChrisM341> With tank controls you can only turn and move forward and backwards
[1:51:18] <+profanityincluded> save that health drink
[1:51:25] <+QueequegTheater> @floralkami the point of tank controls is that you can continue your direction easily with fixed camera angle changes
[1:51:43] <dukenux> and in nightmares yoyr legs feel like made if lead instead
[1:51:45] <thetutorialboss> obviously someone needs to make an Invisible clone with Pat as the protag to balance it out.
[1:51:53] <dukenux> *of
[1:52:16] <floralkami> @QueequegTheater but are the left and right on the left stick just dead? I thought the character turned with the right stick still
[1:52:19] <Broand> Punchmom with death stranding commentary
[1:52:24] <%wolfofsound> I'm burping my stomach with farts :)
[1:52:30] <%GraceTBM> honestly it's weird to watch this streamed by two composed people
[1:52:35] <vierleger> Make a character action game, but Pat is the Vergil and Woolie is the Nero.
[1:52:46] <+QueequegTheater> @floralkami no, that's normal controls
[1:52:56] <GarbageQueenEllie> Now you've got it
[1:53:05] <+QueequegTheater> Tank controls have left/right to rotate
[1:53:10] <Tucker0603> YEYEYEYEYEYEYEYEYE he's playing it! sorry I'm late
[1:53:19] <%GraceTBM> this mentality is how people get lost and check rooms multiple times
[1:53:28] <PlumpPotatoRump> @tucker0603 welcoooome
[1:53:30] <%wolfofsound> or a.........tank
[1:53:32] <+OwlLightningMage> Paige is Nero, Pat is Vergil, and Woolie is V
[1:53:33] <+primax104> a tank woolie
[1:53:34] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Tucker0603 You missed Woolie punching a spider and then dying. It was awesome
[1:53:37] <Finakala> 18 wheel woolie
[1:53:38] <%GraceTBM> what, is that NOT how you walk around rooms?
[1:53:39] <+primax104> thats the point
[1:53:49] <floralkami> @QueequegTheater oh..... Oh barf apatFist
[1:53:52] <+DigbyMayor> That one you can probably punch
[1:54:00] <dukenux> ack
[1:54:00] <%GraceTBM> it should really just pause the game at descriptions
[1:54:07] <hntronium> spiderlings slaughtered
[1:54:08] <dukenux> it should
[1:54:12] <Cozy90> just ask pat
[1:54:12] <Broand> the shield
[1:54:16] <CherrieVelvet> enemies not pausing during text seems like an oversight
[1:54:20] <+profanityincluded> youll have to juke them for flavor text
[1:54:20] <Doppelganger4827> get me pictures of Spider-Woolie!
[1:54:22] <+profanityincluded> work for that lore
[1:54:28] <+QueequegTheater> @floralkami it's specifically to get around old design problems. If up is always forward then fixed camera angle changes don't screw up your movement direction
[1:54:30] <$cureneckbeard> yeyeye
[1:54:34] <+VanaSkiller> LUL
[1:54:36] <CAPSLOCKlive> REFERENCE
[1:54:38] <+primax104> ah yes
[1:54:39] <NemokillerV> LUL
[1:54:43] <dukenux> but i guess the game adsumes you should murder everything in the room

[1:54:49] <Jack_of_No_Trades> I got that and derived pleasure from its inclusion
[1:54:52] <%wolfofsound> please god woolie don't kill another man
[1:55:03] <%UrsulaCat> UrsulaCat subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 10 month streak! heh
[1:55:17] <wsintai> @wolfofsound Hes done it before and he'll do it again

[1:55:19] <GarbageQueenEllie> 100100100
[1:55:26] <floralkami> @QueequegTheater i get that, and i agree, but i would hope the left and right areas of the left stick werent just dead zones

[1:56:02] <mayorrev> YOU DEFEATED
[1:56:03] <floralkami> @QueequegTheater and the right stick does nothing?
[1:56:13] <hntronium> Punchmom smart
[1:56:15] <DedlokPM> Tank controls were both because of "camera change consistent movement" but also (and mostly) because the original dualshock only had the d-pad for movement
[1:56:18] <$cureneckbeard> Woolie figured it out
[1:56:20] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus SHOW PAT
[1:56:25] <hntronium> Ye
[1:56:28] <hntronium> Show Pat
[1:56:33] <+QueequegTheater> @floralkami yes, because tank controls are only applicable with fixed camera angles

[2:03:09] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Ise=Other, Kai=World
[2:03:10] <+ennui_on_me> Well there's debate. Video games are arguably not true isekai.
[2:03:11] <Bigyin396> KO
[2:03:12] <dukenux> Matrix is the isekai

[2:03:22] <+supaXmugen> @maskofmichael the few good ones
[2:03:23] <+ennui_on_me> so like there's argument over whether or not SAO counts as isekai
[2:03:23] <+aishman> KINDA RIGHT?
[2:03:23] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Alice in Wonderland? Isekai
[2:03:26] <GarbageQueenEllie> otaku fuckboi gets a huge harem in Big Booty Elfy Land
[2:03:29] <floralkami> @wolfofsound no, just another world in general, and dont have to be trapped
[2:03:35] <ECRead> correct. isekai is literally "another world"
[2:03:35] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus It's not even DQ, just basic ass JRPG
[2:03:36] <+ladomania> slime isekai is super good tho
[2:03:37] <dukenux> but hate Dragon Quest as isekai
[2:03:38] <Psyramics> hats not an isekai
[2:03:39] <odd_slater> Slime is fun
[2:03:39] <Yukai_Yami> Alice in wonderland is an isekai?
[2:03:41] <+supaXmugen> I hate isekai thats just all about harem self inserts

[2:03:43] <+QueequegTheater> Trapped in Another World With My Cellphone

[2:03:45] <+Enzotheotaku> Hey Woolie big fan of yours I have a question. My bud decided to get into fighting games cause of Terry in smash. Where would be a good place for him to start.
[2:03:45] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> If I absorbed myself into my own anus and it turned out it held a fantasy land is that an isekai?
[2:03:47] <Bigyin396> What's that one where the hero brings his Milf mother along?
[2:03:48] <%UrsulaCat> everquest isekai

[2:04:08] <Bigyin396> Megumin best girl
[2:04:09] <vierleger> Mark Twain wrote isekai
[2:04:09] <simulationbard> That pick up girl's in a dungeon's not an Isekai just a fantsy thing
[2:04:12] <+Winnosh> SAO isn't really an Isekai because the characters don't actually go anywhere. They're just playing computer games it's just that they can't turn it off.
[2:04:13] <dukenux> Is LOST an isekai?
[2:04:17] <%UrsulaCat> minesweeper isekai
[2:04:18] <Conyst> So I'm a spider so what

[2:05:08] <mayorrev> CRONUS!
[2:05:10] <dukenux> Narnia series is ABSOLUTELY an isekai
[2:05:12] <+ennui_on_me> @doc_ock_rokc I mean I'd say it counts myself, but it definitely has different narrative elements to that of say, KonoSuba, where the character is entirely separated from his own culture. It's maybe a subgenre more than a totally different thing
[2:05:14] <tigerfang86> YEYEYE
[2:05:14] <%GraceTBM> futurama is absolutely an isekai

[2:05:27] <%lancerous007> The Matrix is an isekai deconstructed?
[2:05:29] <worldbrand> that painting was actually untitled and the subject matter is unclear

[2:05:52] <floralkami> @wolfofsound that doesn't cover the general definition, and leaves out other shows that for the definitely while also taking others out, like Gate
[2:05:53] <VJdarkworld> army of darkness is an isekai
[2:05:56] <%maskofmichael> The Matrix is a reverse isekai

[2:06:48] <floralkami> @maskofmichael the Matrix isnt an Isekai, it's Earth in the distant future
[2:06:54] <Bigyin396> Are you questioning why GREEK GODS do things?
[2:06:54] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus No, he does it because a prophecy says his kids will kill him so he ate them to stop it from happening
[2:07:02] <+QueequegTheater> Instead of just wrapping up

[2:07:17] <PsychoFlash1> @floralkami the matrix is the isekai, not the movie, the matrix inside the movie
[2:07:23] <GarbageQueenEllie> isekai is an isekai
[2:07:27] <+doc_ock_rokc> Of course this cause Zuse to kill him

[2:13:51] <ChrisM341> Sans is banned in China
[2:13:54] <GarbageQueenEllie> Society's an Isekai
[2:13:56] <floralkami> @DedlokPM its a reverse isekai, i wasnt talking to you in the first place, and you're a bitch for still bitching about a butchered joke.

[2:34:33] <Shishi1205> elmo cleaning too tedious
[2:34:34] <+saladin1911> BUT HOW DO BABiES TASTE THO?
[2:34:35] <speximillian> Elmo's been actually being a shit lately, hope nothing's wrong with him
[2:34:36] <shotgang86> WutFace
[2:34:37] <dukenux> Elmo had a bath emergency
[2:34:38] <TheArrow_> what if you got a pet human
[2:34:39] <+doc_ock_rokc> I also can't have pets in my appartment
[2:34:40] <Yukai_Yami> Elmo got poop stuck on his butt. And Elmo hates baths
[2:34:40] <%GraceTBM> just tape a knife to a roomba
[2:34:42] <TheArrow_> like from an orphanage

[2:34:46] <%UrsulaCat> woolie get a cat instead
[2:34:46] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Get a Bladewolf
[2:34:48] <Owkono> pet rock
[2:34:51] <MisterVantes> Get a roomba it's a great pet LUL
[2:34:54] <+BoboDaHobo> @thezearguy just a piss break that lead to a tangent
[2:34:56] <+RobotPancake> get a Nintendog lol
[2:34:58] <+Emperor_Bad> what if it wasn't a pet it was just a wild animal kept inside
[2:34:59] <%madmikemonkey> @WoolieVersus Hey woolz I checked out the vertabreakers Kickstarter after listening to the podcast yesterday its been canceled and the dev posted a super sad video about their financial issues
[2:35:03] <speximillian> Agree, get a Bladewolf
[2:35:09] <TheZearGuy> The littlest hobo
[2:35:27] <$cureneckbeard> peepoops
[2:35:27] <Ion_Laser> Keaton works
[2:35:32] <hntronium> HERESY
[2:35:34] <Jack_of_No_Trades> Doesn't look the part, I agree
[2:35:35] <GarbageQueenEllie> the faaaaace
[2:35:38] <+necrocannibal2> like a bitch
[2:35:39] <dukenux> but Michael Keatons a good Batman
[2:35:41] <+sabertoothzombie> Jeremy Irons
[2:35:42] <+necrocannibal2> he looks like an old lesbian
[2:35:45] <%wolfofsound> true
[2:35:48] <+DRAGKUDO> he looks nothing like Batman beyond Bruce
[2:35:57] <yuribo26> WOOLIE OLD MAN CONOSSEUR
[2:35:58] <worldbrand> get makeup to do it
[2:36:00] <%Archphronimos> Keaton is the obvious choice to me
[2:36:02] <%wolfofsound> Schwarbage
[2:36:02] <+whiskey_wolfe_> WE NEED %45 MORE CROTCH
[2:36:04] <shotgang86> Michael Keaton would be PERFECT
[2:36:07] <Yukai_Yami> That’s what make up is for!
[2:36:08] <+MurlinDurl> do voice overs the actors like death stranding
[2:36:10] <hussdogrob> you can pretend to be more crotchety it's ACTING
[2:36:13] <+BoboDaHobo> unpopular opinion, Batman should always be animated, live action Batman has always felt silly
[2:36:21] <dukenux> dont be, your right
[2:36:24] <Jack_of_No_Trades> What if they dub Keaton?
[2:36:27] <Sklauda1> my computer froze and had to refresh, what happened to the game?
[2:36:27] <+sabertoothzombie> @BoboDaHobo 100%
[2:36:28] <+Theworld732> I’m just worried how the face on the Batman beyond suit would look in live action
[2:36:28] <Ion_Laser> We need to wait for Kevin Conroy in Crisis on Infinite Earths next month to see how Conroy would work as Live Action Bruce Wayne
[2:36:32] <UnfilteredComic> Just CGI Keatons face onto him
[2:36:35] <Doppelganger4827> have Micheal but dub Rob's voice in
[2:36:43] <@Menitta> "I always hated that Robin"
[2:36:54] <dukenux> Uh
[2:36:58] <Broand> pFPPT
[2:37:01] <Qualitybeats> Whatuo
[2:37:01] <Broand> I GOT IT
[2:37:02] <Akett> HA!
[2:37:05] <%Archphronimos> DEMIURGE
[2:37:05] <simulationbard> Ha "shocked"
[2:37:05] <Explodincatz> weak god
[2:37:07] <+MurlinDurl> Kappa
[2:37:12] <+DRAGKUDO> Yaldabaoth
[2:37:14] <%Dr00_PhD> They sandbagged the hell out of that joke
[2:37:23] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Demiurge indeed
[2:37:25] <+necrocannibal2> god actually loses to another god in the old testament, can't remember the part though
[2:37:27] <cumurasame> we getting into gnsotic PERSONA territory
[2:37:28] <dukenux> Hes just a really strong dude
[2:37:30] <coke_monster> Converted.
[2:37:30] <KSDM> i like Old dickbag God because humans deserve an Angry God.
[2:37:32] <+BoboDaHobo> God's fucking stupid, we just have to convince him of the fact
[2:37:41] <+MurlinDurl> LUL
[2:37:42] <floralkami> Wait, WHAT?
[2:37:46] <dukenux> LUL
[2:37:59] <%Archphronimos> Yaldabaoth = Demiurge = creator god /= The real omnipotent perfect GOD
[2:38:16] <Akett> Incompetent god is the closest thing to feasable to my mind.
[2:38:22] <cumurasame> also Demiurge and GOD WHO DOESN'T CARE ABOUT YOUR PHYSICAL BODY
[2:38:25] <Jack_of_No_Trades> God is Yogi Bear?
[2:38:25] <+whiskey_wolfe_> "Our God is a slow God."
[2:38:32] <%Archphronimos> The Demiurge is inherently flawed in Gnostic teachings, so that's why our physical universe is so fucking flawed and Evil exists
[2:38:38] <RupanSen> can we Truman Show God?
[2:38:40] <+necrocannibal2> don't Jews actually dislike when you point out they weren't always monotheistic?
[2:38:42] <$cureneckbeard> It's like D&D players
[2:38:49] <%onlystrykerfan> Why is Yogi Bear
[2:38:57] <hussdogrob> if God is omnipotent he either doesn't care or is moraly bankrupt like endgame old captain america
[2:38:57] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[2:38:57] <+BoboDaHobo> damn, religion sure is dumb
[2:39:00] <carrotc> What the heckfrick did I just stumble into
[2:39:02] <dukenux> this is much more believable tho than the perfect benevolent god that made... this
[2:39:03] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yogi Bear is true divinity
[2:39:07] <Doppelganger4827> Truman Show is a Isekai
[2:39:12] <%Archphronimos> Check out Gnosticism @WoolieVersus it's fucking fascinating
[2:39:13] <$cureneckbeard> to be fair the jews did make monotheism their first commandment
[2:39:16] <+BubbaRands> So Boo Boo is Jesus?
[2:39:26] <+doc_ock_rokc> Does this mean justin temberlake is jesus for voicing Boo Boo?
[2:39:27] <ChrisM341> Seinfeld is Isekai
[2:39:29] <DonatelloJose> I love fiction
[2:39:43] <+necrocannibal2> what is this
[2:39:50] <%GraceTBM> i haven't seen it, but is the truman show some sort of isekai?
[2:39:51] <+theotherkristian> No overwitez?
[2:39:52] <Doppelganger4827> can't stand this new world, Jerry!
[2:39:57] <bevyrage> @necrocannibal2 mystery of castle superbeast
[2:39:58] <floralkami> Hypothesis: Satan isnt real, and the adversary is God projecting his bullshit on things he doesnt like.
[2:40:02] <%Archphronimos> monotheism IS NOT the first commandment, it means have YHWH FIRST IN YOUR BELIEFS, not exclusive
[2:40:06] <Trash_leviathan> their is like a hundred different sects of judaism, ranging from practically atheism all the way to old testament god @WoolieVersus
[2:40:09] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @GraceTBM More of a reverse isekai, really
[2:40:14] <+necrocannibal2> @ChrisM341 she had cat ears, Jerry, CAT EARS!
[2:40:15] <ChrisM341> @doppelganger4827 XD
[2:40:19] <ShoggothLord> @woolieversus That is wise. It's good to *actually* talk to multiple Jewish people on the subject.
[2:40:21] <+BubbaRands> @GraceTBM Holy shit it kinda is...
[2:40:23] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus So you walk faster in real life?
[2:40:30] <+BubbaRands> NotLikeThis
[2:40:34] <Jack_of_No_Trades> Spider Rematch!

[2:40:52] <Shishi1205> @woolieversus check the camera button
[2:40:55] <dukenux> Truman Show is about a man discovering hes been put into an isrkai.
[2:41:01] <SheefEatsBeef> oh he WALKIN
[2:41:06] <Shishi1205> should be useful
[2:41:09] <ChrisM341> Should've worded that joke better
[2:41:10] <worldbrand> power strides to the toilet
[2:41:18] <rad_dude123465> Woolie in a constant state of MESSATSU
[2:41:20] <+gustavozxd> you throw your sunglasses at people to teleport at them? PogChamp

[2:43:32] <UnfilteredComic> Big cricle
[2:43:40] <Doppelganger4827> lemme check with Ziggy on that one
[2:43:46] <JetpackMcQuack> Just avoid eye contact
[2:43:51] <dukenux> every ep of Quantum Leap is a different isekai.how did anime not copy that yet
[2:43:51] <speximillian> Navigate the 3D space
[2:44:22] <+necrocannibal2> @dukenux that would require effort and creativity
[2:44:32] <Jack_of_No_Trades> that cam doesn't do a bad job
[2:44:39] <+QueequegTheater> Wow Twitter permabanned me for insulting boomers
[2:44:53] <dukenux> Rick and Morty is an isekai since that cronenberg ep
[2:44:55] <Doppelganger4827> Planet of the Apes is an isekai?
[2:44:56] <enamoreddata> Statue's gone
[2:45:13] <%GraceTBM> no planet of the apes doesn't count
[2:45:17] <+doc_ock_rokc> @QueequegTheater not surprising
[2:45:20] <+OwlLightningMage> Elmo is an Isekai
[2:45:21] <%wolfofsound> he killed that guy
[2:45:26] <Doppelganger4827> righto
[2:45:27] <+profanityincluded> you killed that guy
[2:45:28] <$jobbedbone> Aren't most of the isekai adaptations of light novels? I think that trend is restricting the show variety at the moment
[2:45:28] <+doc_ock_rokc> Elmo is a saint
[2:45:32] <%Vyneci> Played college ball you know
[2:45:33] <Ultimatefool> Twitter: Boomer Theater
[2:45:35] <+QueequegTheater> @Doppelganger4827 Planet of the Apes is a movie whose twist is that it ISN'T an isekai
[2:45:35] <+griffball13> football mvp woolie
[2:45:35] <+necrocannibal2> Silent Hill is an isekai
[2:45:36] <floralkami> @QueequegTheater hold up, what? This a joke right?

[2:47:23] <floralkami> @QueequegTheater ....... Remember when people in the chat was yelling at Woolie that the news article he was referencing was a jebait?
[2:47:27] <%notcbo> I think he just reads at the end

[2:49:22] <floralkami> @QueequegTheater there is an article on this boomer who was yelling on his podcast about young people destroying generational conversation, saying "boomer" was ageism and akin to using the n-word for old people
[2:49:22] <+doc_ock_rokc> Munchmom wanted to eat you woolie
[2:49:23] <Tucker0603> woolie is scared of woods?

[2:51:35] <+Skeletor725> doesn't the term boom imply weapons of mass destruction, like a bomb from ww2 perhaps? well the term boomer might of been derived from "Baby Boomer": "a person born in the years following World War II, when there was a temporary marked increase in the birth rate." - google

[2:52:33] <%CaptainPileDriver> i'm throwing money at yall to make myself feel better for going 0-2

[2:52:40] <DedlokPM> My ancestors were cursed so therefore I'm cursed rooSlain
[2:52:48] <floralkami> Why do you think humans haunt the places they die in?
[2:52:53] <MadMischief> wowie
[2:52:54] <@Menitta> This is why Beyond Two Souls sucks
[2:53:06] <TheArrow_> we need to curse woolie again, clearly hasn't learned his lesson
[2:53:06] <mayorrev> jeez dude
[2:53:06] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:53:11] <dukenux> what if ghosts were a biocurse that is a mirror of human Ka, Woolie
[2:53:11] <@Menitta> "Oh Aiden can't go here because reasons"
[2:53:13] <%Archphronimos> It's the consequence of humanity's obsession with immortality @WoolieVersus
[2:53:20] <+OwlLightningMage> Beyond Two Souls sucked because it should've been Stand battles
[2:53:31] <+gustavozxd> !motivated
[2:53:31] <@Moobot> 478 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[2:53:38] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @floralkami It's because the afterlife has squatters rights
[2:53:42] <%CaptainPileDriver> when beyond two souls was free on psn for a month i didn't even bother downloading it cause it's a waste
[2:53:46] <floralkami> Everyone, come together so we can curse Woolie for another 3-4 months. He hasn't learn his lesson
[2:53:46] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> I wonder what that WEAPON is
[2:53:46] <buckwheat70> Major increase of birthrate following the return of soldiers after WWII, a “baby boom”.
[2:53:53] <Broand> Ghosts work like that because they're associated with the area they inhabit.
[2:53:53] <+necrocannibal2> ghosts can throw shit at you
[2:53:59] <blue2red> OhMyDog
[2:54:03] <Breakfast_Megapowers> Breakfast_Megapowers subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! Heyo Darklord of Castle SuperBeast. How are the struggles so far?

[2:54:20] <ChrisM341> The Only memories I have of Beyond Two Souls are replaced by Dunkey's video of it
[2:54:32] <Jack_of_No_Trades> 3 months for this tho

[3:24:33] <seniormeatbox> it was lore
[3:24:40] <joylent_blue> WOW
[3:24:45] <ShoggothLord> @tucker0603 Listen, sometimes a lady just wants a buff werewolf to knot her under the full moon.
[3:24:45] <joylent_blue> she's bloodthirsty

[3:29:08] <Breakfast_Megapowers> We could be playing a cool game that has no macabre undertones like Kirby
[3:29:10] <Jack_of_No_Trades> Ancient cameras, infinite flashlights, time is convoluted

[3:30:31] <Doppelganger4827> then you hear the Deliverence music
[3:30:39] <+QueequegTheater> Shad;s not a pedo he's just an edgy troll

[3:31:45] <Laironx3> 🔈 NotLikeThis
[3:31:47] <RAH001> that was years of suppressed negative feelings towards pat in that shot

[3:31:57] <Akett> I love how there was zero reaction IRL or in-game to Woolie shooting Pat.
[3:32:08] <Jack_of_No_Trades> We all tried
[3:32:10] <+Kindan55> Shad may not be a pedo or a nazi, but he sure does cater to them.
[3:32:15] <a_mad_dragon> Woolie Vs. Woolie
[3:32:21] <hntronium> IMMORTAL
[3:32:25] <+doc_ock_rokc> Pat is IMMORTAL
[3:32:28] <xeros720> woolie just underestimated his shortness
[3:32:29] <Cozy90> put dog poop on a stick and chase pat with it.
[3:32:32] <%king_wragles> Pat is incredibly stoppable
[3:32:34] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Woolie: You say that
[3:32:35] <ChrisM341> Just kick him in the Colostomy Bag
[3:32:36] <GingaNZ> Pat HATESSSSS being shot
[3:32:39] <Agami23> just put your hand on his head and he cant reach you
[3:32:43] <Ultimatefool> Just throw some dirt on him, he will DIE instantly
[3:32:45] <Doppelganger4827> red bull makes him immortal
[3:32:47] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus There's a tiny bug, in the lighthouse, the infinite bullets respawn
[3:32:47] <+whiskey_wolfe_> "A gun fired bullet"
[3:32:48] <%king_wragles> @WoolieVersus just get a jar of mayo, that's enough.
[3:32:49] <Arweynn> Pat has aquired immortality/invulnerability from Elmo
[3:32:49] <themagic_conch> idk gout did a number on him
[3:33:10] <%UrsulaCat> god you nerd
[3:33:15] <@Menitta> I instinctively do that
[3:33:15] <mayorrev> Same tho
[3:33:18] <Jack_of_No_Trades> I march as well
[3:33:19] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @whiskey_wolfe_ As opposed to a stand-fired one, I suppose
[3:33:20] <+marsanta> Best thing about astral chain
[3:33:23] <iswearimjustdandy> @tucker0603 this is a nice art style, but not my thing
[3:33:24] <thetutorialboss> Pat is weak to poison damage confirmed
[3:33:24] <@Menitta> Marching band in my veins
[3:33:25] <enamoreddata> Has the lighthouse been lit yet?
[3:33:34] <ZE_Count> Just got done beating Disco Elysium that was a heck of trip of a game.
[3:33:34] <Breakfast_Megapowers> Woolie breaks out into a musical number when he listens to music
[3:33:37] <%RioGascar> I skip as well, tho only when i get a good speed going
[3:33:39] <MasterDecoder> @enamoreddata Yea
[3:33:40] <Doppelganger4827> gotta skip fast!
[3:33:43] <%UrsulaCat> you can't skip or else people will think you are a girl
[3:33:47] <buckwheat70> Mental damage is always a crit against Pat
[3:33:49] <KingGoblodyte> I skip while listening to Cannibal Corpse
[3:33:52] <enamoreddata> @MasterDecoder thanks
[3:33:58] <ChrisM341> I hate skipping
[3:34:01] <Tucker0603> @iswearimjustdandy i honetly only look at the pics with just the ladies in em but fair enough
[3:34:08] <%RioGascar> people already think im a loser so i can skip all i want
[3:34:12] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus If you need bullets, go to lighthouse
[3:34:16] <+QueequegTheater> Listening to Death mellows me out
[3:34:16] <%RioGascar> what are they gonna do about it
[3:34:32] <%RioGascar> Have poor opinions about me?
[3:34:35] <+doc_ock_rokc> like death stranding

[3:36:55] <Roaringrhema> Suddenly, Shaila bouf.
[3:36:59] <Breakfast_Megapowers> Don't go chasing waterfalls- T:C
[3:37:07] <Dreadnautx> wheres woolie?
[3:37:09] <Finakala> Waterfalls are generally in rivers, yes
[3:37:15] <rytisone> I wonder if waterfall has any secrets
[3:37:16] <dukenux> is there a cave behind it. there got yo be.
[3:37:17] <spacecatstreams> woolie smells.... good
[3:37:22] <Jack_of_No_Trades> Flip the switch
[3:37:23] <CursedNobleman> right hand rule, just use the collision on the right side of the map LUL
[3:37:26] <%Typhaeon> Perhaps you should stick to the rivers and the lakes that you used to, Woolie
[3:37:36] <MasterDecoder> Save before leaving cabim
[3:37:42] <Yukai_Yami> Maybe you shouldn’t chase those waterfalls
[3:37:43] <MasterDecoder> *cabin

[3:38:00] <dukenux> nah, you just turn it off
[3:38:35] <iswearimjustdandy> @woolieversus the tree will have a bunch of enemies around it, its hard to tell the size
[3:38:43] <enamoreddata> If it helps, there are a LOT of monsters near it
[3:39:11] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus It's that centre-right forest area, there should be a couple of spiders close to it
[3:39:12] <+Vagueon> Wut game?
[3:39:18] <Breakfast_Megapowers> Stick to the rivers and streams that you're used to- TLC

[3:53:39] <ShoggothLord> @tucker0603 Oh I got distracted by something annoying. Didn't ya say you were gonna track down that Thiccar Amelia image?
[3:53:42] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Go to bridge, move northeast, if you pass the forest, you're too far
[3:53:44] <+QueequegTheater> @Tacthetyrant no, Panzers had good manuevering
[3:53:51] <CherrieVelvet> the camera is the true enemy
[3:53:57] <+doc_ock_rokc> Follow to the bridge

[3:54:39] <+QueequegTheater> no
[3:55:00] <enamoreddata> Big Tree has Big Spiders guarding it
[3:55:01] <+griffball13> @WoolieVersus i think the biggest tree is guarded
[3:55:04] <mrlastchance1> So is this game good?
[3:55:12] <Shishi1205> you need to spam the shovel when you get near it. also 2 spiders guard the tree you seek
[3:55:18] <iswearimjustdandy> @woolieversus the tree will have enemies around it
[3:55:20] <+QueequegTheater> The biggest tree is like 3 times wider than other trees and has spooders
[3:55:28] <kindashagg> Good is subjective, but it's impressive for a 3-month fan project
[3:55:39] <mrlastchance1> That's more what I emant
[3:55:47] <kindashagg> then yeah it's awesome
[3:55:48] <mrlastchance1> *meant
[3:55:50] <worldbrand> convenient!
[3:55:54] <dukenux> for a fangame? yeah really is
[3:55:55] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus It's northeast of the bridge, it has spider guards, you need to dig
[3:55:56] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Good buy janky. Fitting, considering the series it's inspired by

[3:58:34] <%TheSniperJoe> I want to see the Woolie, go into the waah-tah
[3:58:35] <ShoggothLord> @woolieversus If you jump in the *river,* you wade. And you walk down the river to the waterfall.

[3:59:28] <MasterDecoder> Wrong tree
[3:59:35] <thetutorialboss> the big tree is REALLY fucking big
[3:59:41] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus tree is a fullscreen sized tree
[3:59:43] <Shishi1205> bigger one
[3:59:49] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus There's spiders close to it
[3:59:59] <Broand> Why don't you walk down INSIDE the river until you find the waterfall next time :V
[4:00:00] <+QueequegTheater> It is absolutely massive
[4:00:03] <enamoreddata> The Tree has shallow hills around it
[4:00:09] <Shishi1205> you need to use the shovel not hit with it

[4:01:05] <hntronium> I think woolie is using the shovel wrong?
[4:01:09] <Shishi1205> go further into the forest
[4:01:11] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus also, you'll need to use the shovel, not equip it
[4:01:16] <hntronium> use it from the menu

[4:15:59] <enamoreddata> By the tree on the ledge
[4:16:01] <iswearimjustdandy> @choculaultra how about a 2snacks everywhere system
[4:16:03] <Breakfast_Megapowers> Woolie loves tank controls SO much, you guys don't even know

[4:16:24] <Broand> nooo the neutralgame
[4:16:25] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Woolie's just tsun tsun for tank controls
[4:16:33] <rytisone> aiming takes forever
[4:16:33] <CherrieVelvet> shovel might be a better melee weapon than the bat
[4:16:34] <Flyrant> it's jammed
[4:16:35] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus it has a huge windup animation
[4:16:36] <nichos7> Taking damage interrupts the shooting animation
[4:16:38] <laserbeaming> But God Hand had tank controls!
[4:16:49] <ShoggothLord> @cureneckbeard Superbeast, Superbeast, it's time for Castle Superbeast. Woolz likes this type of game the least, Superbeast, Superbeast.
[4:17:01] <+QueequegTheater> east from the well
[4:17:05] <NotLysander> if you follow that ledge the camera should snap to something
[4:17:12] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus you're looking for a grave
[4:17:13] <Doppelganger4827> glitch gremlin
[4:17:14] <trashcansan> keep going :)
[4:17:16] <enamoreddata> Ledge
[4:17:29] <+QueequegTheater> No
[4:17:32] <+QueequegTheater> But it's cool
[4:17:33] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus The lighthouse
[4:17:40] <BalloniWright> m o r t i s
[4:17:54] <NotLysander> oh he's looking for the grave not lighthouse?
[4:17:55] <+doc_ock_rokc> The light house points to the water fall which is pointed out in the conversation
[4:17:56] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus The light points there
[4:17:56] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:17:56] <+QueequegTheater> It's close to the ledge
[4:18:00] <Valentinius_Anodyne> The lighthouse points towards where you're supposed to go
[4:18:00] <SixthSun2> Always investigate lighthouses
[4:18:02] <iswearimjustdandy> @woolieversus the lighthouse light direction
[4:18:04] <+QueequegTheater> Stay on the ledge
[4:18:06] <SixthSun2> Especially abandoned ones
[4:18:17] <Broand> superbeast, superbeast, it's time for castle superbeast, if woolz is terry then this game is geese, superbeast superbeast
[4:18:31] <Shishi1205> hug the ledge
[4:18:37] <trashcansan> noooo stay near the ledge
[4:18:38] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Broand Oh man, that's a good one
[4:18:43] <+QueequegTheater> It's not around here
[4:18:53] <+QueequegTheater> He has better recovery
[4:19:02] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Hug the cliff edge to the east, it's close to the coast
[4:19:10] <laserbeaming> You can see the place from across the waterfall
[4:19:10] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus you have to stay right along the edge, with the gray sand

[4:20:20] <+QueequegTheater> go to the river to reorient yourself
[4:20:26] <Flyrant> monkaS
[4:20:33] <trashcansan> oh dear, where are you?
[4:20:34] <Shishi1205> my god the ability to lose your way in an instant is impressive
[4:20:35] <+QueequegTheater> also maybe stop running in circles every time the camera moves
[4:20:49] <Broand> go into the river and follow it
[4:20:55] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus There a boss later on, and you lack the health, you should reload now
[4:20:57] <The_Man_Of_The_Lamb> thas a big ol spider
[4:20:57] <Star_Duck> I have no idea what the hell am i watching but i think i like it
[4:21:08] <JetpackMcQuack> Everyones a critic
[4:21:10] <trashcansan> he was really close BibleThump
[4:21:24] <Valentinius_Anodyne> This is why ya gotta kill spiders you find in real life, elsewise they'll grow this big
[4:21:28] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus for the grave you need to stay on the gray ground along the ledge
[4:21:31] <$Louie_Salmon> Yeah saving the health is probably better.
[4:21:32] <smallboops> oh man, woolie is making the salt noises
[4:21:33] <+MurlinDurl> vargBBQ
[4:21:37] <Shishi1205> just go straight
[4:21:45] <Broand> and then fall off the waterfall
[4:21:52] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus It's the dark spot on the south-east of the map
[4:21:56] <Agami23> grave is optional i think
[4:21:57] <+doc_ock_rokc> IF you hit the river follow it
[4:22:07] <Agami23> though what really is optional to a streamer?
[4:22:09] <$Louie_Salmon> If you can get to the waterfall, you're basically right there.
[4:22:27] <iswearimjustdandy> @agami23 its cool and gives the ending hes going for context
[4:22:28] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus you keep turning every time there's a major camera angle shift, try to just keep going forward
[4:22:28] <rytisone> follow that amazing light that lighthouse makes Kappa
[4:22:38] <+QueequegTheater> use the tank controls to your advantage
[4:22:56] <trashcansan> hit the river, hug the ledge, and you'll be there in no time
[4:23:05] <DedlokPM> Use the boost to get through
[4:23:18] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Follow the cliff edge to the east of the waterfall and you'll hit it no problem, just stay in the grey
[4:23:18] <buckwheat70> Heat the key.
[4:23:22] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Try a somersault
[4:23:35] <rytisone> this game needs zapping system to play as Pat

[4:28:08] <starotter70> Don't worry, happened to me too
[4:28:08] <iswearimjustdandy> Directly above
[4:28:10] <Agami23> @WoolieVersus so why did you fall right beside the footing??
[4:28:13] <ShoggothLord> @woolieversus When you stand in the right spot the camera changes to show the cave with you right over it.
[4:28:14] <MasterDecoder> Directly above
[4:28:16] <Masamune195> is the smol game fun

[4:28:34] <Broand> he mindgoblins toded
[4:28:39] <trashcansan> poor woolie lol
[4:28:40] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus It's ok, it was very funny
[4:28:41] <Agami23> logical is a strong word
[4:28:41] <+QueequegTheater> Woolie it's not your fault, this is very much a game for Pat
[4:28:45] <%GraceTBM> thats an empirical guess
[4:28:47] <Breakfast_Megapowers> !motivated
[4:28:47] <@Moobot> 480 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[4:28:49] <countgaculatv> Woolie just use your dreads to glide down
[4:28:53] <rytisone> never assume, know
[4:28:55] <thetutorialboss> !uptime
[4:28:56] <hntronium> less logical and more instinctual
[4:28:56] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 28 minutes
[4:29:02] <NotLysander> It's a lore thing
[4:29:07] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus this is also the longest ending for sure
[4:29:24] <Dr_Mooose> calculated
[4:29:25] <+QueequegTheater> Does anyone know if the grave is a trigger?
[4:29:30] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus It's important that you trash your baby's grave
[4:29:31] <Doppelganger4827> and Woie cast himself from the highest...
[4:29:31] <trashcansan> idk what will kill woolie more: this game or death stranding
[4:29:34] <+QueequegTheater> bc I'm not sure
[4:29:36] <%ChansonNoire> damn I got a sub
[4:29:38] <%ChansonNoire> what the
[4:29:40] <laserbeaming> I don't think so
[4:29:42] <+Kuro_Koshka> the grave doesnt affectr the 3 known endings as far as I know
[4:29:44] <buckwheat70> !fence
[4:29:51] <Broand> The most amount of time in this game is taken up by wandering around blindly
[4:29:58] <trashcansan> ahhhhh noooo
[4:30:04] <+doc_ock_rokc> upi dod
[4:30:04] <hntronium> LOST

[4:30:18] <+QueequegTheater> Yes, the camera and not you veering left
[4:30:19] <enamoreddata> Wrong way
[4:30:28] <Broand> once you know what to do then it's easy
[4:30:31] <countgaculatv> @Masamune195 He's definitely not
[4:30:31] <+cvp5127> oh no
[4:30:33] <KaiserMario> @QueequegTheater I might be wrong, but digging the grave disappears the statue, right? Or is that another trigger?
[4:30:42] <enamoreddata> BACK
[4:30:46] <iswearimjustdandy> @kaisermario it does
[4:30:50] <+doc_ock_rokc> use visual landmakrs
[4:30:50] <+QueequegTheater> @KaiserMario I think so, but I doubt he wants to get the other endings
[4:30:55] <+QueequegTheater> He seems tapped out
[4:31:00] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[4:31:11] <Doppelganger4827> being attacked by Mokujins

[4:40:31] <Shishi1205> B is super easy
[4:40:33] <floralkami> B is real easy
[4:40:34] <rytisone> 25 more endings to go
[4:40:35] <trashcansan> oh god, woolie just sleep
[4:40:35] <$TyroneRugen> It was Bloodborne all along!
[4:40:37] <Masamune195> i want to play the game but i might be spooked too hard lol
[4:40:38] <Jack_of_No_Trades> You got the one Pat didnt get
[4:40:41] <hntronium> Ending C hard though
[4:40:41] <enamoreddata> Use Root baby on Roots
[4:40:42] <rad_dude123465> get b get b get b get b get b
[4:40:42] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus give the baby to the root instead of fighting
[4:40:44] <Shishi1205> what you did but not fight
[4:40:44] <+profanityincluded> plop the fossil root on the root
[4:40:45] <Flyrant> the real castle super beast, were the friends we made along the way
[4:40:46] <Broand> You have to get to the root of the problem
[4:40:47] <Agami23> you go back to that spot and use the petrified roots
[4:40:47] <speximillian> The Baby
[4:40:47] <floralkami> go to the roots
[4:40:47] <starotter70> Same but put Corpse on Roots
[4:40:48] <hntronium> Don't bother trying for C
[4:40:48] <Dr_Mooose> the baby
[4:40:53] <+griffball13> @WoolieVersus you put the root on the roots hanging from the celing in the boss arena
[4:40:57] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Go to cave with boss, ang give baby to root
[4:40:59] <+QueequegTheater> The hanging brown roots
[4:40:59] <thetutorialboss> use the root baby thing on the roots in the bossroom
[4:41:02] <+Kuro_Koshka> C is doable if he uses save 12 its fine
[4:41:04] <+MurlinDurl> The Baby MiniK
[4:41:08] <+profanityincluded> fossil root, on ceiling root
[4:41:08] <ShoggothLord> @woolieversus Ending [B] is done by putting the baby in the roots in the boss arena
[4:41:14] <hntronium> Pat had problems doing C
[4:41:15] <starotter70> Getting there?
[4:41:22] <trashcansan> oh god, he's going to have to get back there
[4:41:24] <hntronium> Woolie ain't gonna like trying for C
[4:41:26] <+Kuro_Koshka> Sav e 12 is for ending C
[4:41:27] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus 12 is for C
[4:41:27] <$cureneckbeard> Ending C is tricky, Pat had to restart his run from scratch to get C
[4:41:29] <enamoreddata> Ending C
[4:41:31] <Dr_Mooose> C is pretty crazy
[4:41:31] <+profanityincluded> ending C is a bitch, but its cool
[4:41:40] <Jack_of_No_Trades> C requires 12 I think
[4:41:44] <trashcansan> don't even try going for c lol
[4:41:45] <rad_dude123465> For C
[4:41:46] <Agami23> you need to start over and speed run to get items out of sequence
[4:41:47] <Shishi1205> C for save 12 should be good?
[4:41:48] <KaiserMario> C is really good, but kinda tricky
[4:41:51] <+QueequegTheater> You have to not pick up the stuff in the lake for C
[4:41:52] <DracaenaLeaf> we are all 12
[4:41:53] <thetutorialboss> B kinda tells you.
[4:41:56] <+Matto424> B will give you a hint
[4:41:57] <laserbeaming> EndingC requires B
[4:41:59] <Broand> You'll know
[4:42:00] <worldbrand> crawl into the dark machine
[4:42:01] <+drabberfaun535> c is the cool ending
[4:42:01] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Do B first
[4:42:02] <Shion963> don't you have to Do B first?
[4:42:04] <enamoreddata> @WoolieVersus When you get the silver feather, jump off the castle bridgre IMMEDIATLY
[4:42:06] <%ChoculaUltra> was half expecting Matt or Pat to show up to hand Woolie a Rocket Launcher towards the end of the fight ngl
[4:42:10] <Jack_of_No_Trades> Requires the codec code from back of box
[4:42:11] <floralkami> do B first
[4:42:22] <shinichizio> catonNom
[4:42:27] <mayorrev> Wait is Ending C a speedrun?
[4:42:30] <starotter70> Yeah, it may require a new run
[4:42:32] <Jaxnos> hot
[4:42:35] <trashcansan> he wants to be tall
[4:42:36] <+MurlinDurl> LUL
[4:42:38] <TheArrow_> Ending C is really cool though
[4:42:40] <starotter70> Height
[4:42:41] <Shion963> C is triggered by B
[4:42:42] <juxtest> Who doesn't?
[4:42:42] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus It's REALITY
[4:42:43] <Kemmybelle> Watch Pats (Paiges actually) stream for ending C.
[4:42:43] <%DashXero> 'Cause you're tall.
[4:42:44] <worldbrand> It's a "nightmare"
[4:42:44] <%FenixSeraph> Pat is Wooliekin
[4:42:44] <+Kuro_Koshka> ENding C is a speedrun yes
[4:42:45] <Flyrant> Pat wants to be tall like woolie
[4:42:46] <Shishi1205> the thing is when you get one item you get locked out of ending C
[4:42:46] <Jack_of_No_Trades> Pat YEARNS
[4:42:49] <fatally_furious> its a nightmare
[4:42:49] <laserbeaming> not exactly?
[4:42:50] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus you're gonna want to see ending C
[4:42:50] <+FrostedZaibatsu> GET OUT ending
[4:42:50] <$cureneckbeard> Pat wishes he was as tall and cool as Woolie
[4:42:51] <+Matto424> You don't dream about being Woolie?
[4:42:51] <rad_dude123465> He wants to be tall
[4:42:53] <+MurlinDurl> or pat is dreaming he is the fixed camera watching you bumble about
[4:42:53] <Tucker0603> C requires new run after B I think?
[4:42:55] <Breakfast_Megapowers> Pat wants the DARKNESS
[4:42:56] <+QueequegTheater> trust me
[4:42:57] <Shishi1205> save 12 is before that
[4:42:57] <+Kuro_Koshka> You don't even need the gun for ending C
[4:42:58] <Shion963> finish B and then start New Game
[4:42:58] <$cureneckbeard> Better WOolie
[4:42:59] <enamoreddata> @WoolieVersus If you progress beyond the feather and get the ruined dagger, you hard lock into ending A/B
[4:43:04] <Kemmybelle> Pat dreams of being tall.
[4:43:04] <@Menitta> Why are you me? i'm me!
[4:43:07] <Jaxnos> woolie's dreamt of being brennan?
[4:43:09] <Ethel9727> Did dream Woolie have a higher power level than real Woolie?
[4:43:11] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat just wants to be tall with hair
[4:43:12] <Jack_of_No_Trades> What was dream woolie like?
[4:43:13] <trashcansan> I thought we all dreamed about being woolie
[4:43:13] <starotter70> It's really weird
[4:43:14] <+Bane_Kaikyo> @WoolieVersus You can get to the cool part in C but you don't have to finish it all the way if that makes sense
[4:43:16] <+QueequegTheater> You made this? I made me
[4:43:19] <ShoggothLord> @woolieversus It's because you're TALL
[4:43:21] <%UrsulaCat> I have dreamt of being someone ele
[4:43:21] <Sedrelic> so.. . brennan
[4:43:23] <laserbeaming> Pat is bringing people into his Nightmare
[4:43:33] <floralkami> i have, but of Raven from Teen Titans
[4:43:39] <%FenixSeraph> I dream of Meaty White Leg Woolie
[4:43:49] <buckwheat70> Lol @sedrelic
[4:43:50] <trashcansan> remember to hug the ledge
[4:44:01] <shadow1man9> @WoolieVersus You need to play a new save up until you get the feather, jump off the castle bridge and get a new item from that location that this current save has been locked out of and play from there
[4:44:11] <mayorrev> okay so for real how cool is ending C
[4:44:19] <mayorrev> does a cool guy show up
[4:44:21] <Shishi1205> very cool
[4:44:21] <Agami23> ending C is super cool
[4:44:21] <+Kuro_Koshka> Not neccesarily
[4:44:21] <hntronium> did it
[4:44:24] <thetutorialboss> How far is his save 12?
[4:44:25] <laserbeaming> kinda cool?
[4:44:26] <+Kuro_Koshka> Save 12 is before the golden dagger
[4:44:29] <+Kuro_Koshka> Is it not?
[4:44:35] <Shishi1205> save 12 should be good for C?
[4:44:36] <+QueequegTheater> it is
[4:44:38] <Dr_Mooose> he did a lot for 3 months of work
[4:44:38] <+Bane_Kaikyo> @mayorrev Cis FUCKING COOL
[4:44:41] <+profanityincluded> C is pretty short if you know what do
[4:44:43] <+QueequegTheater> Save 12 is good for C
[4:44:43] <mayorrev> hmmmmmm!
[4:44:47] <starotter70> Yeah, it's pretty damn impressive
[4:44:48] <Agami23> @Kuro_Koshka yeah but you need to have completed B first i believe
[4:44:54] <Flyrant> chop suey
[4:44:56] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Perhaps you were under the impression they fucked around in Sweden?
[4:45:01] <enamoreddata> @WoolieVersus It MIGHT work as long as the save is immediately after getting the feather
[4:45:03] <shinichizio> I like the alarm clock version

[4:48:59] <Shishi1205> if you have the dagger it won't work
[4:48:59] <+Kuro_Koshka> Jump by the entrace to the castle
[4:49:00] <+doc_ock_rokc> @WoolieVersus you can't do it because you don't have
[4:49:01] <hntronium> closer to the gate
[4:49:05] <CherrieVelvet> @WoolieVersus ending C is locked off when you pick up the items from the lake, save 12 was before you got them
[4:49:07] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus the jump is right next to the castle
[4:49:09] <Broand> LEFT SIDE

[4:50:05] <starotter70> Just go back
[4:50:06] <+profanityincluded> is 12 good enough tho?
[4:50:07] <+Kuro_Koshka> And then jump off the bridge
[4:50:11] <starotter70> I think
[4:50:11] <floralkami> just go back
[4:50:13] <Shion963> start a new game and speedrun the torch
[4:50:14] <MasterDecoder> Check inventory
[4:50:14] <thetutorialboss> Go to the castle. save there.
[4:50:15] <Jack_of_No_Trades> If you have feather, jump off bridge
[4:50:18] <Shishi1205> jump off
[4:50:18] <DedlokPM> @WoolieVersus Starboard right after you leave the castle
[4:50:21] <laserbeaming> now go and jump off that bridge
[4:50:21] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Do NOT pick up the stuff in the lake
[4:50:23] <TheArrow_> make sure you have feather
[4:50:31] <+doc_ock_rokc> he has the feather
[4:50:32] <Jack_of_No_Trades> Make new save before jumping just in case

[4:50:35] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 50 minutes
[4:50:49] <+Kuro_Koshka> Save before jumping off
[4:50:55] <Shion963> Start a new game, the. speedrun to torch and feather

[4:51:37] <+Matto424> you'll be fine
[4:51:38] <Broand> for ending c
[4:51:42] <MasterDecoder> @WoolieVersus You guys are safe from the Jumpscare btw
[4:51:43] <Kemmybelle> If it doesn't work & you don't want to play anymore, you could always watch Paige's stream later.
[4:51:44] <+Kuro_Koshka> It gives you the gun its fine
[4:51:45] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus ya don't need to pick up the gun
[4:51:48] <Broand> oh

[4:51:56] <+doc_ock_rokc> ITs...not wrong
[4:52:04] <+TopTieramisu> how did they capture woolie so well?
[4:52:15] <Flyrant> they mocapped woolie
[4:52:26] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus It's a really cool ending, so it's worth it, but it's not that long that'll want to do it later... so...
[4:52:33] <+Kuro_Koshka> theres only so many bridges to jump off of though
[4:52:45] <Jack_of_No_Trades> Meant to stretch your dollar back in the day, make you explore every inch
[4:52:48] <hntronium> What?
[4:52:53] <Star_Duck> if you are falling too fast, you can always try to shoot and kill the ground before it hits you
[4:52:54] <hntronium> Braid?
[4:52:56] <wirblewomble> you can see where you're supposed to jump off from a camera angle on top of the castle, so it's not totALLY random
[4:53:04] <+griffball13> DIVORCE
[4:53:20] <rytisone> Woolie is raising another flag
[4:53:20] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[4:53:50] <Shishi1205> entrance
[4:53:59] <cumurasame> so in case woolie reads this - I'd like to share one of my teaching moments from here in Japan. I was teaching the kids directions so the game was "turn right, go straight, turn left etc etc stop." So for one particular class, the first time I said STOP. One of the kids decides to be a genius and yelled "ZA WARUDO!" Everyone was about to fall over laughing.
[4:53:59] <+QueequegTheater> jump forward
[4:54:07] <+QueequegTheater> yeyeyeye
[4:54:12] <valriot> "Patience" isn't it like 4 hours?
[4:54:17] <rytisone> no fall damage here

[4:56:47] <Shishi1205> you need to get an item b4 an action happens
[4:56:47] <$cureneckbeard> C is hard
[4:56:48] <%notcbo> it was a hell of a run still
[4:56:49] <mayorrev> too extra
[4:56:53] <Jack_of_No_Trades> That is fine man, the thing at the end is awesome but a pain
[4:56:55] <hntronium> Watch Woolie for A and B, Pat for B and C
[4:56:56] <thetutorialboss> C has a NG+ thingy involving the monster. She doesn't show up if I remember correctly?
[4:56:57] <+paladinstarbuster> its not that long
[4:57:02] <hntronium> Perfect
[4:57:05] <Shishi1205> pat needed like 7 minutes to get it
[4:57:08] <+Kuro_Koshka> Paiges VoD
[4:57:12] <Broand> The monster won't show up in future runs
[4:57:12] <+QueequegTheater> It's fucking WILD
[4:57:13] <+Kuro_Koshka> Remember it was on her stream
[4:57:14] <worldbrand> halloween
[4:57:15] <Personified134> @WoolieVersus they played it on halloween
[4:57:15] <%notcbo> last weekend i think
[4:57:15] <Exiliator> C is crazy
[4:57:17] <Shion963> it's a short run to start C
[4:57:17] <starotter70> Last Thursday?
[4:57:17] <hntronium> Halloween stream
[4:57:18] <MasterDecoder> @WoolieVersus Paige's VOD
[4:57:19] <CherrieVelvet> i don't think save 12 was bad, you probably have to start a new save to do it
[4:57:22] <Kemmybelle> It'll be on Paiges VoD though.
[4:57:24] <Shishi1205> they played Halloween night
[4:57:25] <Agami23> they played it day of release
[4:57:28] <worldbrand> oh gorsh
[4:57:29] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus It's on PeachSaliva's channel
[4:57:30] <Shiranui24> c is the true ending i think
[4:57:31] <enamoreddata> Halloween, five minutes from midnight
[4:57:31] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus it was on Paige's stream
[4:57:33] <rytisone> Lets go
[4:57:33] <laserbeaming> They played the 31 when it was released
[4:57:35] <hntronium> It was in the room with the light key
[4:57:36] <floralkami> its on Paiges stream
[4:57:41] <hntronium> I think
[4:57:43] <+Bane_Kaikyo> NOT PAT'S vod it was PAIGES HALLOWEEN VOD
[4:57:43] <+Steamed_Hagao> waterfall
[4:57:44] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> you go out get key from forest, get key for 2nd floor, then feather
[4:57:47] <Malikwest11> it was in the blue fire room
[4:57:52] <%Wool> can't they just watch Pat's vod right now on stream
[4:57:52] <thetutorialboss> Oh shit. is Woolz a madman?
[4:57:55] <Jack_of_No_Trades> Pat had to contact dev for walkthrough to get it done
[4:57:56] <Shishi1205> it's worth just so you see the end result
[4:57:57] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus room with the blue flame and the lighthouse key I think
[4:57:58] <Dr_Mooose> it can be done quickly, but that is with knowing where to go
[4:58:05] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @WoolieVersus you go out get key from forest, get key for 2nd floor, then feather
[4:58:07] <JetpackMcQuack> Woolies second wind
[4:58:11] <alapazam> has woolie played this before? just got in
[4:58:17] <+profanityincluded> forest key, 1st floor key, 2nd floor key, feather
[4:58:20] <cumurasame> Woolie 2ND GIG
[4:58:23] <+gustavozxd> "I mean look"
[4:58:27] <Broand> WORLDS FIRST
[4:58:29] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus @PeachSaliva Halloween VOD
[4:58:31] <+Bane_Kaikyo> @WoolieVersus If you look for the VOD, it was Paige's Halloween stream
[4:58:31] <starotter70> Eyepatch Wolf has some experience
[4:58:32] <thetutorialboss> Victory lap lets go
[4:58:33] <FstSergeant8595> Woolie make sure you level strength because it scales in this game. There is no soft cap.
[4:58:35] <+QueequegTheater> Woolie used Mean Look!
[4:58:36] <Valentinius_Anodyne> WR pace, baby
[4:58:39] <Breakfast_Megapowers> You barely get to play a video game with a black protagonist at all
[4:58:40] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @rad_dude123465
[4:58:40] <Shion963> the Dev help was that the game didn't make you start a new game, and allowed you to continue with a "finished" he state. Ending C required a new world state
[4:58:42] <Shishi1205> forest key then fire poke then second floor
[4:58:43] <+QueequegTheater> Steph can no longer switch out!
[4:58:54] <CherrieVelvet> @woolieversus you get the key from the forest, then the key from the toilet, then the feather to jump off the bridge
[4:59:04] <ZComiX> `did he get b?
[4:59:05] <hntronium> DANCE PUPPETS
[4:59:12] <shinichizio> [B]lanishment was got
[4:59:15] <+paladinstarbuster> YES
[4:59:15] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus you will be given the gun eventually
[4:59:16] <Shishi1205> get some bullets
[4:59:16] <ZComiX> ok
[4:59:18] <+profanityincluded> please do pick up some bullets tho
[4:59:18] <+griffball13> @WoolieVersus no weapons is no problem for ending c
[4:59:19] <Personified134> I think you do need the gun yeah
[4:59:21] <enamoreddata> @WoolieVersus wou will need bullets
[4:59:21] <$SilverRoddo> Hallowoolieen is still alive.
[4:59:22] <MasterDecoder> @ZComiX Yea, A and B, going for C
[4:59:23] <+QueequegTheater> You need some bullets
[4:59:25] <+profanityincluded> like 20ish
[4:59:25] <Broand> you need bullets
[4:59:26] <+Kuro_Koshka> You don't need the gun
[4:59:27] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Mock The Deadly Enemy
[4:59:28] <+paladinstarbuster> GET THOSE
[4:59:29] <+Matto424> You just need bullets
[4:59:29] <Broand> and thats it
[4:59:34] <nichos7> You do not need the gun, but you do need bullets
[4:59:36] <shinichizio> Poor Dark Souls enemy, can't jump :<
[4:59:37] <thetutorialboss> Gun and Bullets very need
[4:59:37] <+Kuro_Koshka> It give you 20 bullets too
[4:59:44] <+drabberfaun535> you get the gun in the final part of c
[4:59:44] <+Kuro_Koshka> it gives you gun and 20 bullets
[4:59:48] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Chat appears to be split upon the matter of gun
[4:59:52] <+profanityincluded> its fine its fine
[4:59:55] <+QueequegTheater> GUN is divisive
[4:59:56] <hntronium> More bullets is nice
[4:59:56] <laserbeaming> I think you only need the Bat, The Camera and the feather
[4:59:57] <Flyrant> has woolie talked on stream at all about GG2020?
[5:00:02] <Shion963> gun is fine with or without
[5:00:06] <+Kuro_Koshka> Its like you didnt even watch the VoD
[5:00:06] <Broand> if it gives bullets then it's whatever
[5:00:12] <+Kuro_Koshka> You don't need the gun
[5:00:13] <Shishi1205> gun is good
[5:00:14] <+griffball13> you get all you need in the final part of c
[5:00:18] <+paladinstarbuster> Nah
[5:00:18] <hntronium> Just one fight
[5:00:18] <thetutorialboss> I'm not sure what game does about GUN
[5:00:19] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus it's not that long
[5:00:19] <ZComiX> C is super short
[5:00:23] <Jack_of_No_Trades> Very long to beat
[5:00:23] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:00:26] <ZComiX> No you dont need the gun
[5:00:26] <Shishi1205> to get to it yeah
[5:00:29] <%Wool> Can't they just watch Pat's vod or a video of Ending C
[5:00:31] <NemokillerV> oh yeah, I forgot that it gives you gun.
[5:00:32] <+profanityincluded> more like an actual bossfight, A was pathetic
[5:00:33] <floralkami> !MOTIVATED
[5:00:33] <+Kuro_Koshka> Chats drinking dumb bitch juice
[5:00:33] <@Moobot> 482 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[5:00:35] <Exiliator> You get all you need
[5:00:37] <Shishi1205> to beat it it's another thing
[5:00:40] <thetutorialboss> Does C just give you the GUN?
[5:00:42] <Kemmybelle> Getting to C can be short, beating C could take a bit.
[5:00:42] <laserbeaming> The bossfight will take you a while
[5:00:44] <+RichardMF_> 7 mins to get to, the boss will take a little more @woolieversus
[5:00:45] <Shion963> yep
[5:00:46] <+Tonku_the_Red> Just got here. Who is that with Woolie?
[5:00:46] <prime_name> Don't forget Mindjack @WoolieVersus
[5:00:47] <ZComiX> gives gun
[5:00:49] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus you don't need to pick up the gun but grabbing a few extra bullets could help
[5:00:51] <+Kuro_Koshka> Pat did it on Paiges stream you absolutely do not need the gun
[5:00:52] <+QueequegTheater> @Kuro_Koshka how dare you say such completely justified things
[5:00:52] <Agami23> you dont need to get the gun. it will be given to you
[5:00:52] <DracaenaLeaf> Didn't it take pat awahile for ending C?
[5:00:52] <hntronium> If they watch the vod it'll be like a 4 person lp all over again
[5:01:01] <+Bane_Kaikyo> I thought C gave an infinite gun?
[5:01:03] <Shion963> get to C or complete C
[5:01:04] <@Menitta> Mario Sunshine speedrun
[5:01:09] <+griffball13> MINDJACK was a great stream
[5:01:10] <@Menitta> Those are rad
[5:01:13] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Considering that chat knew how to do it, it took much less time than Pat & Paige
[5:01:13] <+QueequegTheater> @DracaenaLeaf we just need to get Woolie to the boss, he'll mark out
[5:01:19] <+gustavozxd> what about that guy that was gonna speedrun omikron or something

[5:05:20] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Paige stream took 6 hours because nobody knew how to do it, and Pat had to contact Remerai to get ending C...

[5:08:02] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus SpeedRun Strats
[5:08:03] <+Kiiper> It helps a lot
[5:08:03] <Jack_of_No_Trades> I dont know if it gives it to you, but Pat used it
[5:08:07] <Graxe_> Doesn't all the camera do is let you reset the camera angle?
[5:08:07] <ZComiX> everything will be given to you in time
[5:08:10] <hntronium> TWO GUYS
[5:08:11] <Broand> So how do you do the final boss then? you need to change perspectives all the time
[5:08:11] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus listen to KaiserMario
[5:08:12] <nichos7> Overused it, maybe
[5:08:12] <laserbeaming> is the boss beatable without the camera?
[5:08:13] <TheArrow_> how else will you take creepy ghost selfies?
[5:08:23] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @WoolieVersus Camera is just to readjust the camera in the forest world
[5:08:39] <CherrieVelvet> doesn't the camera work in the boss fight tho?
[5:08:40] <+Kiiper> Yeah, not sure how you do the boss without the camera
[5:08:40] <shadow1man9> @WoolieVersus Remember to jump down the waterfall for something after grabbing the feather
[5:08:44] <Broand> and the boss arena
[5:08:45] <laserbeaming> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli and in the last boss room!

[5:18:59] <%GraceTBM> you can use a single pillar to hide from it by running around it
[5:19:05] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Shoot it when it loses you, Stab with knife 2-3 times, run away, repeat
[5:19:05] <Dr_Mooose> yeah, there should be shadows

[5:19:46] <floralkami> @woolieversus the red shading shows where it is looking
[5:19:46] <+QueequegTheater> You hit him a bit
[5:19:49] <KaiserMario> WHIFF
[5:19:52] <$SilverRoddo> Gravity Falls?
[5:19:54] <laserbeaming> is the lighting bugged or is it on low?
[5:19:55] <Jack_of_No_Trades> he has a hit react
[5:19:55] <enamoreddata> You have time for two stabs
[5:20:02] <Shishi1205> camera woolie
[5:20:03] <hntronium> Lighting is super fucked I think
[5:20:16] <Breakfast_Megapowers> Use the moves to win
[5:20:19] <thetutorialboss> Lighting is beyond fucked
[5:20:19] <JetpackMcQuack> Quit it eye demon
[5:20:23] <+Tonku_the_Red> @woolieversus Who is the lady with you tonight?

[5:20:41] <+MurlinDurl> oh fuck run
[5:20:43] <DedlokPM> 3 stab rooPog
[5:20:45] <enamoreddata> TWO stabs
[5:20:49] <starotter70> Yeah, he attacks on wake up
[5:20:51] <shinichizio> Merh!
[5:20:53] <+profanityincluded> 2 stabs is safe
[5:20:58] <+QueequegTheater> I think it has like 10ish health right?
[5:21:00] <+Bane_Kaikyo> @WoolieVersus Given that you stuggle with the controls still, I think nobody really expects you to be able to beat this boss.... like, pat had trouble and he LOVES tank controls and survival horror...... I can't really speak for chat, but I think maybe it was enough to simply make it here and see the secret boss pop off
[5:21:02] <arkv01> oh no!
[5:21:08] <SaltyAzteca> Thats it for your health bro, now it is time to succeed!
[5:21:08] <floralkami> the thing DPs on wakeup
[5:21:14] <hntronium> Is Woolie gonna beat the boss in less tries than pat?
[5:21:18] <Jack_of_No_Trades> bad lighting bug is making eyes vision cone not clear
[5:21:23] <ZComiX> Hey Woolie, What does the Boss Remind you of?
[5:21:24] <nichos7> @WoolieVersus The level's lighting fucked
[5:21:30] <+whiskey_wolfe_> *beh*
[5:21:38] <Shion963> the lighting is important to the puzzle
[5:21:38] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:21:40] <KaliasTV> I assume this is a unity game and it defaulted to the low graphics preset?
[5:21:41] <arkv01> yeah its the colors are freaky but this makes it really hard to see the eye
[5:21:45] <Shion963> shank him
[5:21:48] <Shishi1205> knife 2 times
[5:21:50] <Breakfast_Megapowers> Stabby Mc Stabb
[5:21:53] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> survival horror tech
[5:21:55] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Good luck man, took Pat about 4-5 tries
[5:21:56] <+QueequegTheater> two more I think
[5:21:58] <+MurlinDurl> ur close
[5:22:00] <ZComiX> You got about 12 more hits to do
[5:22:02] <+QueequegTheater> use camera way more often
[5:22:06] <Shishi1205> or knife him from the furthest distance
[5:22:07] <Dr_Mooose> this is really good for a second attempt
[5:22:07] <laserbeaming> it might have defaulted to low shadows
[5:22:08] <thetutorialboss> Woolie is doing a lot better than he reasonably should be. Lighting and Camera are both kinda fucky.
[5:22:18] <+Kiiper> two more and I don't think he grab healing in the kitchen
[5:22:23] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus so it's doable but tough
[5:22:25] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Boss health is the number of pillars
[5:22:27] <%Theplahunter> Theplahunter subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Lets go! 2 months and hopefully many more. I've been following you and the guys for years... And now i can start giving back with money.
[5:22:27] <+MurlinDurl> NotLikeThis almost had him
[5:22:29] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> dunno what u messin wit
[5:22:30] <+griffball13> @WoolieVersus you should heal and get the spare bottle on the counter
[5:22:34] <+QueequegTheater> Also the lighting is completely bugged out
[5:22:34] <Jack_of_No_Trades> if he beats this with bugged lighting, it is more impressive then when Pat beat that invisible bloodborne boss
[5:22:37] <+Kiiper> @WoolieVersus There's healing in the kitchen
[5:22:38] <+ladomania> woolie your shadows are fucked
[5:22:40] <Shishi1205> top off before the encounter
[5:22:41] <hntronium> You should also go into the match with full health
[5:22:43] <+ladomania> its making it harder lmao
[5:22:46] <+DigbyMayor> @woolieversus You did better than pat did
[5:22:46] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus heal now
[5:22:48] <Breakfast_Megapowers> Use your EVO "Going Pro" training
[5:22:50] <Kemmybelle> It's okay Woolie, it took Pat a few tries too.
[5:22:50] <+RichardMF_> @woolieversus the lightning is very messed up than what its supposed to look like
[5:22:51] <+Bane_Kaikyo> @WoolieVersus in addition to the controlls, the camera and the lighting seem broken
[5:22:52] <arkv01> Mista, shoot us better!
[5:22:54] <Shishi1205> get that bitch to full life
[5:22:57] <ZComiX> 12 hits
[5:23:04] <+griffball13> 12 dagger hits
[5:23:04] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus heal now and grab the bottle in the kitchen
[5:23:06] <ZComiX> i THINK
[5:23:08] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Pillars are boss health
[5:23:14] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus you can NOT get 4 in each time
[5:23:20] <%Wonderbot3000> Wonderbot3000 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[5:23:24] <Tisaric> oh that's nice
[5:23:25] <+QueequegTheater> get two
[5:23:28] <thetutorialboss> Woolie might actually beat the boss in less attempts.
[5:23:29] <Breakfast_Megapowers> 4 is not doable
[5:23:32] <+profanityincluded> 2 each time is safe
[5:23:33] <Breakfast_Megapowers> do 2 or 3
[5:23:35] <enamoreddata> @WoolieVersus I highly sugguest you go with two stabs each round. You can do three if you are close at the start. Any more and you get hit
[5:23:37] <+QueequegTheater> We watched Pat bumble this
[5:23:38] <Dr_Mooose> 4 is a super risking move
[5:23:42] <ZComiX> Pat's Stream was 8 hours long. 2 were on the boss
[5:23:42] <+griffball13> 3 is opptimal but 2 is safe
[5:23:44] <Shishi1205> 3 is with risk
[5:23:45] <Dr_Mooose> *risky
[5:23:46] <+ladomania> pat took a long time to do it
[5:23:47] <+QueequegTheater> use camera more
[5:23:48] <+ladomania> that's why
[5:23:53] <SparkAfterDark> Woolie learning in real time how survival horror bosses are solved games
[5:23:55] <laserbeaming> try quitting the game and check if the lighting quality is on low? @woolieversus
[5:23:56] <+RichardMF_> 2 is safe 3 if you shoot him up close
[5:24:06] <Breakfast_Megapowers> do 1 swing each just to be a baller
[5:24:11] <Jack_of_No_Trades> fast spinning is projectile incoming
[5:24:25] <$TyroneRugen> Lightning seems busted
[5:24:29] <JetpackMcQuack> Looks like a samurai jack episode
[5:24:31] <+QueequegTheater> it is
[5:24:47] <SparkAfterDark> actually yeah the light is so fucked up you're at a massive disadvantage right now. And it doesn't look as cool.
[5:24:47] <NeroInfinite> It was made in like 3months so yeah
[5:24:53] <Breakfast_Megapowers> Gotta get back to the past Woolie Madden!
[5:24:56] <+omglmao> not in a game section?
[5:24:59] <ZComiX> Woolie the boss is easier if you can fix the lighting bc it shoes where he is looking and what State he is in
[5:25:09] <Dr_Mooose> Samurai Woolie
[5:25:16] <thetutorialboss> Lighting was fine on Peach's vod.
[5:25:19] <+QueequegTheater> 3 stabs

[5:26:25] <+QueequegTheater> @neraren yes
[5:26:33] <thetutorialboss> They thought this was a Survival Horror, but it was actually a Fighting Game.
[5:26:38] <+MurlinDurl> when you keep wiffing your gun parry in bloodborne :(

[5:27:06] <Broand> do a YRC gunshot into C.S
[5:27:11] <SparkAfterDark> If he loses this time he's GOTTA reset to fix the lighting. missing out on the shadows is both a handicap and a bummer because visually this part is rad as shit
[5:27:13] <+QueequegTheater> 6 HP
[5:27:22] <juicysal> Try turning off the flashlight before giving Pat the dagger next time, it might be fucking with the lighting?

[5:36:28] <Tucker0603> @xeros720 to be fair we were all here
[5:36:29] <CopperTucker> this game is so rad
[5:36:30] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Kappa

[5:36:46] <Doppelganger4827> tank controls forgiven
[5:36:47] <Dr_Mooose> super impressive
[5:36:52] <thetutorialboss> Woolie beat more of the survival horror in less time than Pat. My world is all upside down.
[5:36:53] <Breakfast_Megapowers> its gonna be so weird hearing both the subscribing note at the start and the ending donation in one stretch
[5:36:55] <arkv01> that kigurumi looks WARM
[5:36:57] <+Bane_Kaikyo> Remerai went really hard, he's got skill
[5:36:58] <+MurlinDurl> humanity restored
[5:37:08] <$SilverRoddo> Is Woolie a Mega Man robot master?
[5:37:18] <floralkami> @whiskey_wolfe_ no, this was Woolies thing. Also the podcast in the first place
[5:37:21] <hntronium> Pat still never did Ahegao Academy
[5:37:36] <Shion963> 24h Clone is my favourite
[5:37:40] <Flarepulse> Pat lives Ahegao Academy
[5:37:52] <ZComiX> Hey woolie did you notice the Boss was a big, ugly eye?
[5:37:53] <Valentinius_Anodyne> What about the secret 14th ending tho
[5:37:56] <%UrsulaCat> liam route ahegao is good btw
[5:37:57] <+mattymcfilth> @silverroddo hes a unit 01
[5:37:58] <%TubeMan642> @SilverRoddo he is eva unit 1
[5:38:02] <rytisone> more different endings than Mass Effect 3
[5:38:03] <shadow1man9> @WoolieVersus Congrats on beating the game! So for reference, the real jumpscare was at the bottom of the waterfall on Ending C specifically
[5:38:03] <xeros720> the arms flailing about being "combat" is so Alone in the Dark it hurts
[5:38:08] <Breakfast_Megapowers> Woolie why are you dressed as someones mom?

[5:38:47] <Flarepulse> hey @WoolieVersus have you checked out Sound on Fury on Netflix, a good portion of it is done by the Jojo op Batman Ninja studio
[5:38:48] <ZComiX> its a nice tight gam
[5:38:49] <Doppelganger4827> Silent Dave 2
[5:38:49] <floralkami> DeadlyP stream coming soon
[5:38:55] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @WoolieVersus Now that youre here, if you have any free time to spare read/watch Golden Kamuy. Its a super cool manga about a hunt for gold with criminals and military dudes.
[5:38:57] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus There's a theory, that Pat was the King and you were the Alchemist... get it? Because Chemicals
[5:38:58] <+chaos5338> why does Woolie look like a football player?
[5:38:59] <Flarepulse> Sound and Fury*
[5:39:07] <Agami23> from what i heard the anime is shit but the manga is good
[5:39:10] <Dr_Mooose> watch Vinland Saga
[5:39:14] <hntronium> anime is fine
[5:39:14] <NeroInfinite> niceu
[5:39:19] <%notcbo> THORFINNNN
[5:39:23] <Breakfast_Megapowers> What? I never got a gifted sub? RIGGED
[5:39:24] <Superblooms> awww i was too late for gifts
[5:39:27] <+DigbyMayor> How nice
[5:39:30] <+Kage_96> Dude the anime is legit imo
[5:39:42] <+Kage_96> but never read the manga
[5:39:46] <+QueequegTheater> YOU DEFEATED
[5:39:47] <xeros720> you killed the pat
[5:40:06] <+QueequegTheater> they also don't exist
[5:40:10] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> they can touch you!
[5:40:12] <Agami23> i saw some comparisons and i think people were upset with the anime because it went more realistic at times. where as the manga has alot more focus on style
[5:40:13] <Breakfast_Megapowers> Yeah, my first message was like half an hour after the start
[5:40:15] <xeros720> ghosts are just the Death Stranding
[5:40:21] <Jack_of_No_Trades> poultrygeist
[5:40:30] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> WOOLIE REMEMBER OMIKRON
[5:40:33] <Agami23> what about a ghost shark? @WoolieVersus
[5:40:35] <xeros720> so they can't interact with the world, but they can interact with you real good
[5:40:37] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Ghost can rape you 24/7 and you'll never know
[5:40:37] <Laironx3> Only fear the super boss ghost
[5:40:40] <Breakfast_Megapowers> What if the water becomes haunted?
[5:40:41] <starotter70> They could knock that glass onto your head
[5:40:45] <KaliasTV> Every liquid you try to drink is knocked over, forever
[5:40:45] <+Nomicro4u> what if they give you a ghost blowjob like in ghost busters?
[5:40:45] <ha2ken> Reminds me of the ghost, werewolves, vampires podcast...
[5:40:47] <+whiskey_wolfe_> wAIT WHAT
[5:40:51] <enamoreddata> Isn't the fear of ghosts is that when a ghost strangles you, it strangles your SOUL?
[5:40:51] <Valentinius_Anodyne> If ghosts can interact with the the world, then they can be punched in the face. Ain't no reason to be scared of ghosts
[5:40:52] <%GraceTBM> what about if it just knocked over every single glass you ever fill in your apartment
[5:40:58] <TheArrow_> woolie's already survived one curse
[5:40:58] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus what if a ghost is up your urethra RIGHT NOW
[5:41:01] <%UrsulaCat> water knocked over onto my laptop
[5:41:03] <xeros720> peeing the pool of blood might be all the monster energy though
[5:41:04] <Agami23> @WoolieVersus what about a ghost that makes you feel like you are constantly playing omicron the nomad soul?
[5:41:05] <rytisone> what if they show your nudes online
[5:41:05] <floralkami> WOOLIE HASNT LEARNED
[5:41:07] <Broand> Ghosts can't interact with the world directly, but they can manipulate people and people are psychic. Gottem
[5:41:10] <Dr_Mooose> they could push you down stairs
[5:41:16] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> WOOLIE NEVER LEARNS
[5:41:18] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> NOT AGAIN
[5:41:20] <Jack_of_No_Trades> But what if the ghost was a vampire
[5:41:21] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> HAUNTING AGAIN

[5:42:23] <arkv01> glub glub glub thanks for the mosnter!
[5:42:23] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Part of the fear of ghosts, is that you could end up becoming one, trapped forever in a limbo of pain

[5:45:41] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Literally took him 10 tries.
[5:45:47] <Jack_of_No_Trades> you just did better in every way in harder circumstances
[5:45:52] <Agami23> pat had to ask the creator for help @WoolieVersus

[0:06:39] <Augus7717> damn sure is
[0:07:40] <jaygee303> This is what should’ve said played in the Dante v Vergil fight
[0:07:40] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:07:41] <Das_Wood> when is soon...
[0:07:56] <%Gruhunchously> We're at now now.
[0:08:07] <Ravingpyro> go back to then!
[0:08:12] <+FroggoPrince> yoooo, we KotoR bois
[0:08:14] <Augus7717> soon is the nebulous timeframe between now and never
[0:08:15] <%Gruhunchously> We're past then
[0:08:23] <Ravingpyro> When?
[0:08:27] <%Gruhunchously> Just now
[0:08:32] <%correctedsun117> Eventually
[0:08:33] <jaygee303> How long will they be streaming for? 2 hrs?
[0:08:42] <Ravingpyro> when will THEN be NOW?
[0:08:43] <zocano> Probably time for Dantooine
[0:08:48] <zocano> Probably
[0:08:52] <%Gruhunchously> SOON
[0:08:56] <%correctedsun117> 30 minutes ago
[0:09:03] <jaygee303> @zocano Oh that convo
[0:09:04] <LilacKing> SourPLEASE
[0:09:31] <+Zanco23> Have they said Dantooine or Korriban yet?
[0:09:34] <zocano> They usually stream for 2-2.5 hours for this half of the day
[0:09:41] <Augus7717> no word where they go next
[0:09:45] <%Gruhunchously> I mean it's gotta be Dantooine right?
[0:10:05] <iN33DaNam3> Hello lads lytSUP
[0:10:14] <eliudfs1> I hope it's korriban. there's some sick shit there.
[0:10:19] <lennonbad> what this song ?
[0:10:27] <Das_Wood> ooo korriban has lots of plot
[0:10:40] <lotharrio> Dantooine makes more sense. Korriban should be saved for last.
[0:10:40] <zocano> Korriban is also short a f
[0:10:43] <%Gruhunchously> Sick shit that we won't be able to see unless we're sufficiently light side...so I'm hoping
[0:10:56] <%DatAsuna> yeah my money is in dantooine
[0:10:58] <%DatAsuna> but also
[0:11:01] <zocano> But doing Dantooine now probably makes more sense
[0:11:05] <%DatAsuna> I expect v will suggest backtrcking first
[0:11:10] <%DatAsuna> so we may pop back in to nar shadda
[0:11:23] <zocano> For what? The rodian vendor?
[0:11:27] <%Gruhunchously> We should lean hard into the goody two-shoes on Dantooine
[0:11:30] <%DatAsuna> do some clean up, get some mandos, maybe do some shoppinig
[0:11:31] <Chaoko99> afternoon everyone.
[0:11:33] <zocano> oh wait the Mando thing
[0:11:39] <%DatAsuna> Also yeah, no mandos on korriban
[0:11:53] <%DatAsuna> Oh and then also also dantooine will send us way back to telos
[0:11:56] <Chaoko99> actually is 4PM afternoon?
[0:11:57] <%DatAsuna> cause grell
[0:12:04] <+Zouledge> I haven’t kept up but I’m guessing judging from the comments they finished onderon ?
[0:12:08] <%DatAsuna> maybe some twerka withdrawls too
[0:12:11] <Chaoko99> I feel like 4:30PM is evening, but 4pm is afternoon.
[0:12:13] <Das_Wood> i'd say 4pm is afternoon evening starts around 5-6
[0:12:23] <%DatAsuna> @Zouledge yup,
[0:12:32] <zocano> My first playthrough I did Dantooine first so in my head it's always "do Dantooine first"
[0:12:34] <Dangerzone979> They finished part 1 of Onderron
[0:12:34] <+Zouledge> @datasuna Thanks
[0:12:42] <%DatAsuna> On my first runI did onderon first
[0:12:47] <%DatAsuna> but I like the order they picked
[0:12:57] <zocano> The order they're doing makes the most sense for Woolie
[0:13:02] <zocano> To get all the party members
[0:13:12] <+Zouledge> What’s the next planet ? I assume dantooine ?
[0:13:21] <+Zanco23> Korriban actually makes the most sense as the very first planet you go to before Nar Shaddaa, because Kreia says Sion's name. In their playthrough when they talk with her in Nar Shaddaa the Exile says Sion's name even though he shouldn't know it yet.
[0:13:21] <Chaoko99> do you think Woolie knows his channel description still links to SBFP

[0:18:08] <jorniev> did they finish?
[0:18:11] <%barkon345> yputube was a pirating webste

[0:18:30] <%Jetzord> @Zanco23 Y'toub I think
[0:18:32] <+Zouledge> @chaoko99 Already got it
[0:18:34] <%Gruhunchously> We might want to play this next planet super light side to make up for some of the light laters we did.
[0:18:35] <Doodle_Taco> THERE IS NO TIME
[0:18:40] <Chaoko99> BUY IT AGAIN @Zouledge

[0:20:12] <jorniev> yeeah
[0:20:13] <%DatAsuna> Speaking of clone wars you're gonna have to finish all of it and rebels to understand mando season 2
[0:20:15] <%jiggy_snipe> yea
[0:20:17] <+prime_name> I'm the same way
[0:20:17] <Doodle_Taco> Yeah same
[0:20:20] <%StaceMcGate> @kikanshat0masu We got two left, either Korriban or Dantooine
[0:20:24] <+Zanco23> Clone Wars is mostly filler though, so you're all good.
[0:20:25] <%RioGascar> Btw woolie are you gonna watch all seasons of clone wars or finish s6 and go to rebels?
[0:20:27] <+kikanshat0masu> Thanks
[0:20:29] <%optimasmaximas> fhow can you get the full grasp if you're not paying full attention?
[0:20:31] <%jiggy_snipe> why would you not focus on it?
[0:20:39] <+Zouledge> Same
[0:20:43] <jorniev> I don't now who can do that
[0:20:47] <%RioGascar> i would recommend doing all seasons of clone wars and if you want then do rebels
[0:21:04] <%Irridium> personally I like saving Korriban for last
[0:21:06] <%jiggy_snipe> people who tend to miss stuff Kappa
[0:21:17] <%derap41> ah reddit
[0:21:32] <jorniev> HK gets robbed
[0:21:37] <+Zouledge> @riogascar Lot of people don’t like rebels but Imo it has good points even not as high as clone wars
[0:21:53] <%wunp_fxs> ue5 is interesting but i dont trust it until i see an actual game
[0:21:53] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:22:00] <jorniev> rebels high points are really good
[0:22:02] <%StaceMcGate> The good news is 3 hours on the ebon hawk for LORE is near the end
[0:22:03] <%perfectsalami> My main reason for not watching rebels is the art style
[0:22:10] <%perfectsalami> have you seen what they did to yoda
[0:22:19] <TheFramedWarlock> Same, I don't wanna watch clone wars because it looks really bad imo
[0:22:39] <%DatAsuna> creative cloud sucks
[0:22:42] <%ggbhtg> Yarr, you assholes
[0:22:46] <gypsystranger> hey just finished the first vod have they started the game yet?
[0:22:51] <%wunp_fxs> fuck Adobe so hard
[0:22:54] <gammongaming11> preach brother
[0:22:58] <+Zouledge> @perfectsalami Yeah some chi staffers get ifffy with that style, luckily Yoda dosent appear all that much
[0:23:00] <%DatAsuna> Remember when everyone abadoned final cut to go to adobe?
[0:23:01] <%StaceMcGate> Rebels is a massive downgrade from the final seasons of Clone Wars. Clone Wars had a rough 1st season, but Rebels is OOF
[0:23:04] <%Jetzord> Adobe is a piece of shit
[0:23:07] <%DatAsuna> And now people are ditching adobe for final cut. lol
[0:23:08] <%derap41> We have a monopoly
[0:23:14] <Doodle_Taco> They went to the dark side
[0:23:22] <Chaoko99> Whoever decided that your canvas should shooot out from under you if you approach the edge of the canvas while drawing Needs to die
[0:23:22] <%tearknack> seriously, either YARR HARR or use Adobe Alternatives
[0:23:26] <%derap41> They aren't even fighting it anymore
[0:23:39] <rubbishbinge> Photoshop as a subscription is a wild concept
[0:23:39] <Chaoko99> Titanfall 2 is 3 bucks rn go forth
[0:23:43] <%vorpalswordable> Yay! I love shitting on Adobe.
[0:23:48] <CrmznOgre> I want to see that court case
[0:23:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> How dare you own old product when we demand you rent new service instead? LITERALLY A CRIME AGAINST THE INVISIBLE HAND! REEEEEE!
[0:23:57] <%perfectsalami> How do you get different colored text?
[0:24:05] <%Irridium> a shame there's no way to acquire old versions Kappa
[0:24:09] <%RioGascar> as a student i just get the shit for free
[0:24:14] <%DatAsuna> When i first started video editing I did imovie, until it suffered the same fate in updates
[0:24:16] <jorniev> avid is way better...so I'm told
[0:24:26] <%RioGascar> And yes adobe is being shit BUT AUTODESK IS BEING ASSHOLES
[0:24:27] <%tearknack> use libreoffice or openoffice instead of actual Microsoft Office, use ????? instead of Adobe
[0:24:30] <%ggbhtg> This is the part where someone posts those alternatives to Adobe programs, in the same color breakdown as each Adobe prog
[0:24:38] <arkv01> D: WoolieVS confessionals
[0:24:40] <+Zanco23> Confession! Where are the authorities?
[0:24:47] <CrmznOgre> It is illegal to not have internet
[0:24:54] <%DatAsuna> This is 300% relatable rn lol
[0:24:55] <%tearknack> @ggbhtg yeah if anyone with link permissions has that, link it please
[0:24:59] <%DatAsuna> I miss student licenses
[0:25:03] <Carpediem0> who is the guest?
[0:25:15] <%derap41> That's called Malware
[0:25:17] <+Zouledge> Legit question do you guys know of any good alternatives to adobe ?
[0:25:21] <zocano> Gotta go into the RegEdit and kill that shit that way probably
[0:25:21] <+oldneckbeard> @WoolieVersus is apple still preffered for creative programs?
[0:25:27] <%RioGascar> Gimp
[0:25:28] <gammongaming11> so are they using vegas instead?
[0:25:35] <%subjectg> see: matlab, having no suitable alternatives for when you need to read serial input
[0:25:38] <%RioGascar> Sony vegas for video editing
[0:25:50] <%RioGascar> I think theres a new one called zbrush
[0:25:50] <vulkan_vibes> matlab is a monopoly for sure
[0:25:51] <jorniev> WHAT NEXT if you do not buy or program we will see you
[0:26:00] <CageRedfield> !uptime
[0:26:00] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 26 minutes and 11 seconds

[0:26:14] <%correctedsun117> woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM
[0:26:18] <vulkan_vibes> wolfram alpha has some kind of matlab version. it's weird
[0:26:22] <%DatAsuna> I assume he meant not highly enough
[0:26:39] <%ggbhtg> If I were able to post links, this is where I'd post this

[0:26:49] <%DatAsuna> The jedi are still the good guys
[0:26:55] <jorniev> the exile is THE BEST jedi
[0:26:59] <%tearknack> @WoolieVersus the KOTOR comics are pretty good. They're set pre KOTOR 1, before and during the Mandalorian War, following some rando padawan
[0:27:00] <Doodle_Taco> Expanding a binary system is always cool
[0:27:05] <%DatAsuna> We can't all be sargon saying the sith were right
[0:27:06] <zocano> A lot of it is a response to the Prequel Jedi
[0:27:11] <Chaoko99> and full of assholes
[0:27:12] <vulkan_vibes> most of the star wars universe requires being selfish to survive
[0:27:13] <Jaku2011> The Jedi being so flawed makes them more interesting IMO
[0:27:15] <%subjectg> the jedi as a concept exist, but the execution of that concept in-universe is... not the best
[0:27:19] <%ggbhtg> If that link actually worked, that'd be the pic with all the Adobe program alternatives
[0:27:26] <CrmznOgre> It would be interesting if we get the og jedi and sith with the lightsaber backpacks and the magic blood swords.
[0:27:28] <%correctedsun117> Good can be boring when's that all you are, and most Jedi don't have the nuance of Luke or Obi Wan
[0:27:43] <vulkan_vibes> star wars universe is brutal af for normal peasants
[0:27:51] <vulkan_vibes> hence...wars
[0:27:52] <%Irridium> Obi Wan and Ventress totally fucked
[0:27:54] <jorniev> BEING GOOD IS GOOD
[0:27:54] <CrmznOgre> It would be interesting if we get a game the og jedi and sith with the lightsaber backpacks and the magic blood swords.
[0:27:57] <darwood_> talk about how Darth Vader is cool
[0:28:00] <%subjectg> i really like the exploration of jedi doctrine and its failings though
[0:28:07] <%DatAsuna> Highlights can be provided
[0:28:10] <%Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus its one thing to pick apart how evil Nazi German and Soviet Russia were, its another thing to pick apparently the hypocritical idealology of the otherwise heroic Allies
[0:28:20] <%DatAsuna> That's fine
[0:28:25] <zocano> I'm downloading SWTOR right now to finish up the class stories I didn't do before NotLikeThis
[0:28:26] <%Chatterbox1991> apart*
[0:28:28] <%ggbhtg> time is limited
[0:28:28] <%Ashenik1> What? In the second movie Yoda warned Luke not to go for a Vader bait, but he didnt listen an barerly survived ;d
[0:28:28] <%DatAsuna> Wookiepedia is a fun afternoon
[0:28:32] <%tearknack> which books though?
[0:28:32] <%bigmacjack12> Without giving away big big spoilers, the comics show the dangers of leaving SOME jedi to their own devices
[0:28:44] <%tearknack> the KOTOR comics are pretty good. They're set pre KOTOR 1, before and during the Mandalorian War, following some rando padawan
[0:28:44] <vulkan_vibes> @woolieversus the heir to the empire trilogy is the peak of old EU
[0:29:07] <%DatAsuna> BUT SAND
[0:29:08] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[0:29:08] <zocano> And by new shit you mean old shit
[0:29:08] <%tearknack> @vulkan_vibes in that its icnredibly overhyped
[0:29:13] <rubbishbinge> Is blood pool at $4k yet?
[0:29:24] <Chaoko99> hey titanfall 2 collectors edition is 3 bucks American on Origin. Buy it. Please. I need people to play against.
[0:29:37] <%Ashenik1> Maul just looks uuuuuuuu EVIL RACE
[0:29:38] <Chaoko99> and that's the last I'll talk of it the rest of the stream
[0:29:39] <+evbites> just in time
[0:29:42] <+SolidusRex> Woolie, it won't be just aesthetic once you watch more Clone Wars. Maul is legit good there
[0:29:47] <%phatmac16> Clone Wars Maul is top tier
[0:29:48] <%Irridium> god I hope EA brings Titanfall 2 to steam. Imagine it. People actually playing Titanfall 2 on PC
[0:29:49] <+SarcFa> @Ashenik1 and yoda also told him to not go try and rescue his friends in ep 5, but doing that let him learn that vader = his father, and gave him motivation to try to redeem vader in 6
[0:29:49] <Doodle_Taco> Samurai robots are cool
[0:29:54] <+jimmyboomjenkins> But but Vader bad because of prequels
[0:29:54] <vulkan_vibes> it gave us thrawn. this alone makes it prime.
[0:29:55] <TheFramedWarlock> But how can you enjoy Vader when Anakin exists ? Kappa
[0:29:55] <%Malik1002> hearing more about revan moves him up to me personally
[0:29:55] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Palpatine will always be my boy. Gonna pretend RoS doesn't exist
[0:29:57] <%optimasmaximas> YEYEYYEYE
[0:29:57] <%StaceMcGate> YEYEYE
[0:30:01] <Chaoko99> @Irridium It straight up is the fucking steam tax right
[0:30:01] <Augus7717> PogChamp
[0:30:02] <StarlitStunner> Dark Wizard Space Samurai is a strong aesthetic

[0:30:06] <%derap41> That is money people would murder over
[0:30:08] <%Jetzord> BIG MONEY MATCHES
[0:30:11] <CrmznOgre> Maul's like that emo song that you loved as a kid, but still love it as an adult
[0:30:12] <%ChoculaUltra> Oh lord
[0:30:14] <lotharrio> Wait what's it at?
[0:30:16] <zocano> kill minh
[0:30:16] <damienlunas> how much did he say it is?

[0:30:19] <%ekodrop> Sorry Woolie...
[0:30:24] <%RioGascar> 4,000$
[0:30:24] <vulkan_vibes> revan is what evil looks like when it's smart.
[0:30:25] <%Jetzord> More than Joe Exotic would pay a hitman for
[0:30:25] <zipperdude33> Dear god
[0:30:27] <%RioGascar> jesus
[0:30:28] <%optimasmaximas> @lotharrio 4k
[0:30:28] <cipher758> blood everywhere.
[0:30:28] <%ChoculaUltra> That’s so much blood money.
[0:30:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THE BLOOD WILL SPILL
[0:30:30] <%Diana869> hows it feel to lose 4k?
[0:30:30] <arkv01> holy shshh
[0:30:31] <Doodle_Taco> I would legit consider hustles for that
[0:30:32] <DonatelloJose> Someone gonna hey SHOT
[0:30:33] <%subjectg> Someone’s gonna die

[0:30:53] <darwood_> i agree with V
[0:30:54] <vulkan_vibes> give us....the backwaters
[0:30:54] <%Jetzord> That's more than a downpayment on a car
[0:30:58] <+evbites> Angry Cyborg Zombie
[0:31:00] <%Ashenik1> @SarcFa so he survived becasue Vader went soft on him.
[0:31:01] <%bigmacjack12> 4K LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOO
[0:31:02] <Jaku2011> I'm not caught up on Dokapon did Reggie ever get out of the hole he dug himself
[0:31:04] <%DatAsuna> Iconic, but not ubisoft iconic
[0:31:16] <+oldneckbeard> like moldy burnt toast
[0:31:17] <%RioGascar> i reallt wanna know who came up with the breathing idea
[0:31:19] <%perfectsalami> smells like rotten fish and burnt SIMP in there
[0:31:22] <teamzackattack> smelliest sith is best sith
[0:31:23] <DonatelloJose> that’s why pat hates him
[0:31:27] <%optimasmaximas> psaBig
[0:31:30] <DXLelouch24> @woolieversus you need to make the Darkling hailmary play,Minh Must Not Win
[0:31:30] <vulkan_vibes> not much restored content on this next planet
[0:31:31] <%subjectg> Vader is cool, but i always considered him on the weaker end of the power scale, so the constant escalation of power is off to me
[0:31:32] <NeakGX> bIG numBERs
[0:31:38] <darwood_> i have a new planet smell air freshener in my truck
[0:31:42] <Thepothero> BIG combo
[0:31:45] <DonatelloJose> DO NUMBER
[0:31:45] <CrypticMochi> Would he smell worse than Sion?
[0:31:49] <%Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus I would advise we go super light side for this next planet.
[0:31:50] <%phatmac16> DO COMBO FOREVER
[0:32:03] <vulkan_vibes> hasn't the power of force users been creeping down? KREIA says as much.
[0:32:08] <+evbites> i assume vader smells like fire
[0:32:08] <TheFramedWarlock> Vader is at the top of the power scale canonically
[0:32:22] <%Irridium> could pick up some certain mando's in a certain room
[0:32:37] <TheFramedWarlock> But comics have to show cooler and cooler stuff so other Sith seem stronger
[0:32:44] <%GrassCannon> Can't go to that one city, guess the whole planet's off limits Kappa
[0:32:46] <%DatAsuna> And lots of farms
[0:32:59] <Chaoko99> hey chat answer a question for me
[0:33:05] <Chaoko99> Should I make white gravy beef rice again
[0:33:09] <eliudfs1> Figures, Korriban is great, but I understand why going to Dantoine first.
[0:33:09] <%Irridium> yes
[0:33:10] <%perfectsalami> yes
[0:33:12] <Chaoko99> It was good but I wanna do it right
[0:33:15] <Doodle_Taco> yes
[0:33:18] <%Jetzord> Yes, do it
[0:33:19] <%DatAsuna> Korriban don'trhymes with morraband
[0:33:19] <%tearknack> 14 months
[0:33:21] <%Gruhunchously> It's like poetry
[0:33:23] <%ChoculaUltra> “Exogol”
[0:33:38] <jorniev> maybe they did it first
[0:33:39] <+ChrisAlgoo> force is stored in the exogols
[0:33:40] <%DatAsuna> Exalol
[0:33:42] <Augus7717> BECAUSE MONEY (talent)

[0:34:04] <+evbites> it got spoloded
[0:34:14] <+RJay80> dusted
[0:34:15] <%Gruhunchously> He blowed it up
[0:34:15] <zocano> It happens off screen
[0:34:16] <%subjectg> @vulkan_vibes there’s a line later where she mentions that old sith lords were much more powerful than now, and i’ve always liked the idea that the jedi we see in the movies are a far cry from times old
[0:34:19] <%DatAsuna> It was told but not shown
[0:34:21] <%GeneralSCPatton> HE DID THE BIG FUCK
[0:34:21] <%Jetzord> Malek tried a magic trick with it
[0:34:29] <%RioGascar> I remember as a kid thinking he lied
[0:34:32] <+evbites> orbital laser on the temple
[0:34:36] <%RioGascar> then i played kotor 2
[0:34:55] <%Gruhunchously> You might want to put your lightsaber away
[0:34:56] <+evbites> space cloth
[0:34:56] <%GrassCannon> armor plates?

[0:50:14] <+Bluemanzee> Ithorians are born in lockers
[0:50:17] <%GrassCannon> Ithorians woolieVS Lockers
[0:50:21] <%DatAsuna> The flip cards are great
[0:50:21] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:50:34] <%DatAsuna> It can make HUGE minuses
[0:50:42] <zocano> ya the flip cards are strong
[0:50:48] <%subjectg> they’re for very niche situations though
[0:50:54] <lotharrio> It can CRAZY change things.
[0:50:57] <%RioGascar> Wow that can blow your ass up
[0:51:11] <%Jetzord> It's super subjective but if the situation comes up it's great
[0:51:11] <%subjectg> i prefer consistency of +-
[0:51:18] <toffshelf55> Just joined, Is this the pazak stream!!!
[0:51:46] <Maleicus> Its funny when someone used the flipcard on them they called it cheating LUL
[0:52:05] <jaygee303> Does V arrive in the robe or does he put it on before stream
[0:52:09] <+Zouledge> They should make irl pazak playing cards doodLUL
[0:52:12] <%DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus Flip cards are valuable because they invery 2 and 4s into -2s and -4s, making it easier to not go broke, or to win by a 9 card streak
[0:52:15] <damienlunas> I prefer Big Minus
[0:52:17] <NeakGX> it's time to p-p-p-p p-p-p-p-pazak
[0:52:39] <%subjectg> Take out the +-1 and use sumthin else
[0:52:43] <Augus7717> LUL
[0:52:49] <%DatAsuna> USE THE FLIP
[0:52:53] <toffshelf55> Blue Eyes White +-6
[0:52:54] <%RioGascar> Huh
[0:53:11] <%RioGascar> Or you could have used that flip
[0:53:13] <darwood_> V lives in the robe
[0:53:14] <%DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus Flip cards INVERT 2s and 4s, instead of swithcing the,. It makes them minuses
[0:53:20] <+Jasuchin> I play with all reds and bluereds, except for a single doubler card
[0:53:25] <$MaSterChiEfin420blntNinjA> I think they believe that the flip turns 2's to 4's and vice versa
[0:53:33] <%Ashenik1> what does 2&4 do?
[0:53:35] <Maleicus> Flip cards take away the cards they flip and subtract that amount
[0:53:40] <+Deano8817> PAZAAK VERGIL
[0:53:40] <%ChoculaUltra> the Seto Kaiba of Pazaak?!
[0:53:41] <alrobot2014> this dude in particular is a massive fucking cheater
[0:53:42] <+MagicBeanBurrito> PAZAAK BOSS
[0:53:51] <Maleicus> Its nuts really
[0:53:53] <%RioGascar> The 2&4 makes them negative
[0:54:01] <%Ashenik1> thx
[0:54:13] <+oda_flobunaga> which planet is he on ?
[0:54:16] <+jaytitan96> This is what you get for calling us nerds, woolie
[0:54:17] <%ChoculaUltra> Shin Pazaak.
[0:54:30] <%correctedsun117> THAT'S NOT HOW THAT CARD WORKS
[0:54:30] <Chisas_Dead_Body> PUREST(TM) PAZAAK
[0:54:41] <+jaytitan96> LOL
[0:54:45] <+TheOneCalledRock> LUL
[0:54:47] <%Gruhunchously> It flips it to a negative, not a 2
[0:54:49] <DestroyerPhoenix> we figured it out bois
[0:54:49] <%DatAsuna> It's way stronger than you think
[0:54:57] <SnaKemuho> Now the real pazaak begins.
[0:54:57] <%Irridium> Pazaak has changed
[0:54:59] <%DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus Also drawing 9 cards without going bust beats a 20
[0:55:01] <TheLennster> LOOOOOL
[0:55:02] <Jaku2011> Easy Pazaak has been unlocked
[0:55:03] <%subjectg> it’s still pretty damn niche
[0:55:28] <%GrassCannon> He's only been playing for weeks?
[0:55:32] <toffshelf55> You’re a second rate duelist with a third rate deck!!!
[0:55:36] <%DatAsuna> It is, but with huge potential
[0:55:42] <%StaceMcGate> line these....POCKETS
[0:55:42] <+griffball13> time to fill that PACK
[0:55:43] <%Gruhunchously> He's like the nerd who plays something all the time and gets super good at it, so nobody wants to play
[0:55:55] <sendart> time to save scum LUL
[0:55:59] <+evbites> no get t 3
[0:56:02] <jorniev> this fuck

[0:58:01] <+Jasuchin> Fuck
[0:58:08] <Lefteron> @WoolieVersus Shouldn't there be the option to use the force to cheat at this/
[0:58:09] <SnaKemuho> could've won by full desk
[0:58:33] <%RioGascar> Using the force kinda defears the minigame
[0:58:35] <%Pillagius> it must be work of enemy Stand
[0:58:35] <+Jasuchin> I NEVER saw a 17 stand win
[0:58:39] <DestroyerPhoenix> NotLikeThis
[0:58:40] <%Gruhunchously> Ithorian is like: "It's just a game, why do you have to be mad?"
[0:58:46] <Lefteron> Make it dark side if yo udo
[0:58:50] <+JariahSynn> pazaak is rigged. I never played this
[0:58:55] <+bellerophon343> sbfpDattebayo sbfpDattebayo sbfpDattebayo
[0:58:58] <%subjectg> i’ve stood and won on 17 before, but i was at a comfortable lead
[0:59:19] <Jaku2011> "Can't believe how free your are Mr. Y'Pakk"
[0:59:20] <%RioGascar> I dont wanna see you 2 play blackjack
[0:59:20] <+Jasuchin> Still, hits him in the hand advantage
[0:59:25] <%LordSDB> BIG CHEAT!
[0:59:27] <NeakGX> two cards ahead
[0:59:28] <skeith77> asmonGASM asmonGASM
[0:59:30] <lotharrio> Okay. Starting to feel strong.
[0:59:31] <+pyrojack6> making hm spend his hand
[0:59:32] <NeakGX> LET'S GOO
[0:59:32] <%RioGascar> Then again dealer always has to stand at 17 with casinos
[0:59:35] <%Gruhunchously> Now who's cheating
[0:59:43] <%Ashenik1> Honestly the best card game is poker in RDR, sometimes I just install it to play
[0:59:48] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> LUL LUL LUL
[0:59:48] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> this mother fucker

[1:00:27] <%subjectg> FRAUD DETECTED
[1:00:30] <%correctedsun117> @WoolieVersus I think you can play 2 cards in one turn
[1:00:33] <%RioGascar> Your hand is pretty trash
[1:00:34] <Augus7717> SEND IN HK
[1:00:37] <+shry2049> [Force Persuade] I have lost this set.
[1:00:38] <+pyrojack6> wtf
[1:00:43] <+Jasuchin> THat's bullshit
[1:00:44] <cipher758> king of games
[1:00:51] <toffshelf55> Didn’t get R Kellyd
[1:00:52] <%Gruhunchously> Observation: Master, this Ithorian meatbag is clearly playing Pazaak fraudulently. This could be interpreted as an act of agression.
[1:00:53] <%Ashenik1> I need to check if it is rigged
[1:00:59] <%phatmac16> he's just playing against Yami
[1:01:16] <besthouseadventuresstar> You could have used tiebreaker and won the game
[1:01:22] <lotharrio> Reworking your build. This is the true Dark Souls.
[1:01:24] <+bellerophon343> PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[1:01:24] <%ChoculaUltra> "My pazaak deck has no pathetic cards, Fann Y'!"
[1:01:36] <tolloponik> Pokets is Disappointed somewhere
[1:01:38] <%DatAsuna> Yes that name is a kingdom hearts reference
[1:01:40] <%subjectg> I prefer blue cards than red, i prefer getting the advantage early than hoping for the exact minus
[1:01:49] <Shade075> I bet one of his mrare equipment he has is the damn millennium puzzle
[1:01:51] <%Pillagius> "You are NOT PREPARED!"
[1:01:52] <%illtima> "HE MUST NOT WIN"
[1:01:58] <%LordSDB> https://clips.twitch.tv/ElegantCrunchyMosquitoUncleNox
[1:02:02] <%gutlesscoward> I wouldn't waste it
[1:02:03] <+Jasuchin> Let him have this one
[1:02:04] <+rider_megalon> I'm smelling johns
[1:02:04] <%perfectsalami> Hank Hill "Buuhh Im bout to bust"
[1:02:07] <+Bluemanzee> Bustin makes me feel good
[1:02:08] <+Jasuchin> Keep the cards
[1:02:09] <Ravingpyro> made the best grilled cheese sandwiches to eat while watching the stream
[1:02:14] <%Fujiwara_92> You can (NOT) win the first turn
[1:02:15] <+pyrojack6> strategic loss
[1:02:17] <%GraceTBM> use the 2 4 and 3 6 cards to fuck up his play @WoolieVersus
[1:02:23] <%RioGascar> Im curious, what number do you both stand at if you play blackjack in a casino?
[1:02:31] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> wew
[1:02:38] <%DatAsuna> 17 always
[1:02:40] <+griffball13> real pazzak hours
[1:02:41] <%GraceTBM> 21 rio
[1:02:57] <zocano> big cheats
[1:02:58] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> 18+2
[1:03:02] <%RioGascar> I usually stand at 13 or 14
[1:03:08] <lotharrio> ROLL FOR THE 1!
[1:03:08] <skeith77> PogChamp PogChamp
[1:03:14] <%GraceTBM> @WoolieVersus the reverse 2 and 4 and other reverse cards can ruin his stand after he's played
[1:03:16] <%DatAsuna> If you had put the -2 you would had auto won
[1:03:18] <%RioGascar> Cause my hand usually starts at 7 or 8 and then i add on
[1:03:18] <+pyrojack6> jeez
[1:03:19] <%MrRabbles> its unfair that you go first
[1:03:26] <%DatAsuna> Because filling the 9 slots ALWAYS beats 20
[1:03:31] <infinite_rotation> 18 to 20 for me
[1:03:35] <%GraceTBM> Use the fancy cards to fuck with him
[1:03:37] <ralphfromdk> What armor mod is it even that we are playing for? O.o
[1:03:42] <infinite_rotation> black Jack is my shit
[1:03:50] <%ChoculaUltra> just remember, Yami's power was straight up the ability to draw the card he absolutely needed at any time.
[1:04:00] <Chisas_Dead_Body> Pazaak!stream
[1:04:14] <%RioGascar> 18 or 17 to stand is way too dangerous
[1:04:15] <%DatAsuna> They're on the right track
[1:04:22] <%RioGascar> like getting to those reliably is hard
[1:04:31] <tolloponik> Get your game on
[1:04:32] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[1:04:32] <infinite_rotation> @riogascar just the way I like it
[1:04:34] <toffshelf55> Challenge him to a shadow game.
[1:04:49] <%DatAsuna> exodia!
[1:04:50] <%MrRabbles> send him to the shadow realm
[1:04:51] <Shade075> If Kotor 3 was ever made I bet you could play pazaak games on swoop bikes
[1:04:53] <%RioGascar> Again i stand around 13 or 14
[1:04:55] <lotharrio> Tie breaker, so good.
[1:04:59] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yaaay
[1:05:04] <%ChoculaUltra> it'd be sick if Atton could step in if you lost too many games
[1:05:15] <toffshelf55> Pazak on swoop bikes?!?!

[1:06:29] <MarkUriah> too real
[1:06:31] <+Zouledge> @ralphfromdk At this point it’s more bout his pride as a pazak player LUL
[1:06:35] <lotharrio> Those yellow cards are the way to win.
[1:06:37] <Augus7717> you send in HK-47 @WoolieVersus
[1:06:38] <%Gruhunchously> Extreme luck
[1:06:41] <+AsinPersuasion> honestly i can't not do dantooine first
[1:06:43] <+oldneckbeard> you cheat back
[1:06:46] <+CelebrityGhost> do you have to fill your deck? can you just pick the 4 you want and nothing else?
[1:06:47] <+oda_flobunaga> 42000 credits to go boys

[1:06:51] <%derap41> The worst part is this ruins all othe pazak
[1:06:54] <%DatAsuna> This is when you meet that guy at the arcades you can't beat and all you want it to take ONE win off him
[1:06:55] <%Gruhunchously> This is going to be the entire stream, and I can't even complain.
[1:06:56] <%Ashenik1> classic RPGC strategy - save and load
[1:06:59] <Chisas_Dead_Body> Nagito the system
[1:07:00] <%RioGascar> and then the casino beats the shit out of you for counting cards
[1:07:00] <silver__viii> T3 canonically counts cards, send in the boy!
[1:07:02] <+Zanco23> People always say deal with the hand you've been dealt. I disagree.
[1:07:02] <%GeneralSCPatton> DICE POKER IN WITCHER 1 LITERALLY GAVE BETTER NPCS MORE LUCK
[1:07:03] <+ItsRatman> is there a mod that autowins pazaak for you? XD
[1:07:07] <Jaku2011> "I'm surprised you still have money left Mr. Y'Pakk"
[1:07:14] <$Clarke1010> TRIPLE TRIADDDDD
[1:07:18] <+pyrojack6> PogChamp
[1:07:20] <%DatAsuna> You built card advantage
[1:07:20] <%subjectg> My way of thinking is that you have more chances to predict a 20 through + cards than through - cards
[1:07:20] <%Gruhunchously> Darth Sion, Darth Nihilus, nah...THIS GUY is the true antagonist of the game.
[1:07:30] <+oda_flobunaga> The more you loose to him the more you need to win back
[1:07:31] <damienlunas> -4 stand on 19

[1:14:02] <%Jetzord> I would totally watch a high stakes Pazaak tourney on ESPN
[1:14:09] <%Gruhunchously> It removes the +4 as well so it's effectively -8

[1:38:22] <%subjectg> to be fair, they weren’t doing much about those mandalorian raiders back in kotor 1
[1:38:27] <+doc_ock_rokc> Heard you were talking shit!

[0:25:59] <aretos1> @Applecannon63 I am SERIOUSLY SAD that they ditched smelling darkness after CoM
[0:26:01] <andre11dr> Sharingan was cool when it was like Epitaph and showed you the future a bit,but then by the end it did everything and anything

[0:26:28] <MKII> does woolie know about michel ancel's latest instagram post. it's unbelievable
[0:26:30] <@Menitta> What if cool eyes was something that was so common, you suck if you don't have it like augmentation in Deus Ex
[0:26:39] <Blank9> what about hajime no ippo's green eyes mode?
[0:26:39] <brachydios777> Isn‚Äôt super saiyan eyes green?

[0:27:52] <KohryuZX> Rise of the Shield Hero
[0:27:53] <bing_commander> Ultra instinct no eyes
[0:27:53] <cipher758> As long as it is well constructed I assume. naruto kind of just started focusing only on the powers at the end. Remember that madara meme?
[0:27:56] <DaKnightWarrior> the guy that has Tatoo's that glow when he's angry ResidentSleeper
[0:27:56] <Applecannon63> Bleach is just swords
[0:28:09] <%Mr_Strut> Woolie thinks Virgil is lame confirmed
[0:28:16] <%Prevot> man bleach was fucking terrible
[0:28:18] <centuronstar> @Applecannon63 Until theyre not tho
[0:28:19] <Rostichenburg> But Bleach's swords can be any other weapon though
[0:28:26] <brachydios777> Let‚Äôs have a middle ground and say super saiyan eyes are a greenish blue
[0:28:28] <@Menitta> but Vergil has beowulf too
[0:28:33] <+Dova573> Bleach swords are kinda devil triggers
[0:28:37] <%Prevot> I tried rewatching it last year and the beginning isn't good at all
[0:28:39] <%chosenjuan42> the best super eyes are Judge Doom from Who framed Roger Rabbit. that dude has dagger eyes
[0:28:43] <comicalmond9135> well there supposed to
[0:28:44] <peachy996> Everyone's sword is cooler than your sword
[0:28:44] <$BallerSwagBro9k> FIRE EMBLEM STYLE LUL
[0:28:45] <RunoEddie> Ushio & Tora has the protagonist using a very cool spear
[0:28:53] <sendart> A lance that shines to the ends of the world
[0:28:56] <%Mr_Strut> Sword is the hero weapon
[0:28:56] <centuronstar> I mean some of those Swords turns into flower petals. Or a giant Snake Monster.
[0:28:56] <odd_slater> I'm guessing Woolie was a Chad guy
[0:28:57] <prime_name> All of dmc is lame confirmed
[0:29:07] <$BallerSwagBro9k> OOPS ALL SWORDS
[0:29:07] <Terracora> Nero engine sword? Red Queen is badass
[0:29:16] <%Seancicle> We eating?
[0:29:19] <DarknutSha> But Kenpachi though
[0:29:19] <+Dova573> Swords are kinda are not as cool stands in bleach
[0:29:22] <aretos1> Sword is neutral, while other weapons kind of are shorthand for other things
[0:29:25] <%Mr_Strut> I feel sad
[0:29:31] <$BallerSwagBro9k> HERESY WOOLIE
[0:29:32] <+dmtjinni> Woolz
[0:29:49] <Applecannon63> Nero at least has an Engine blade and a demon arm
[0:29:49] <aretos1> Axes means the user is "brutish" Rapier is "noble" etc
[0:29:59] <andre11dr> This is the main caracter argument, were you have the guy that you can alter to beat al the weirdos with their bizarre powers, something something Jotaro Kujo
[0:30:00] <comicalmond9135> ya no eye powers
[0:30:01] <+jiggy_snipe> and he's an edgelord too
[0:30:02] <%Mr_Strut> Is that really an eye power though?
[0:30:02] <centuronstar> And a gun
[0:30:05] <zeif00> My stupid ass read MK2 instead of MK 11

[0:30:18] <%Seancicle> nice nice nice
[0:30:21] <comicalmond9135> jensen with raidens sword would be a better fit
[0:30:23] <brachydios777> All I know is that the main character in Bleach is basically Nero
[0:30:26] <SaberOfRed97> im actually playing through metal gear rising for the first time and god damn its amazing so far
[0:30:27] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Woolie Overthinking again LUL
[0:30:28] <%Prevot> @SomersaultJustice basically lol
[0:30:28] <+Dova573> If its not Original WHY BOTHER Kappa
[0:30:30] <aretos1> i like F/SN's medusa's eye power
[0:30:31] <cipher758> the wooliegan
[0:30:38] <Applecannon63> I feel that with Asta being a sword and other weapon
[0:30:54] <niddron> @woolieversus what about monster inside someone giving him power?
[0:31:05] <andre11dr> Wat about guns?
[0:31:07] <%Mr_Strut> Woolie hate sword
[0:31:09] <Applecannon63> Asta having just giant sword and not other weapon changing
[0:31:20] <%Terracora> The man speaks the truth, I have some spare cash so here we go!
[0:31:20] <prime_name> I stopped caring about originality a long time ago
[0:31:22] <+Dova573> but yeah One piece so far has no eye poewers
[0:31:25] <+linSP> sorry I‚Äôm a sword elemental everything in my life is sword
[0:31:33] <fernandapsdois> we turned into woolie will figure it out
[0:31:41] <revoltingimp> Go! Kurama!
[0:31:42] <%chosenjuan42> Remembered when I killed your brother and I sounded JUST LIKE THIS!
[0:31:44] <%Prevot> @Dova573 no way, there has to be at least one
[0:31:45] <aretos1> i'ts barely been done in a intersting way
[0:31:46] <brachydios777> @dova573 Isn‚Äôt it basically devil fruit?
[0:31:48] <@Menitta> "Forgive me master, I need to go all out just this once"
[0:31:50] <Blank9> there's not enough transforming for real from monsters inside
[0:31:52] <RunoEddie> does Woolie know about Ushio & Tora?
[0:31:56] <+TopTierHarley> CHainsaw man is good though
[0:32:02] <%Kriss1827> @dova573 does observation haki count?
[0:32:03] <JaseAdrift> @Dova573 Doesnt Zoro have an eye power
[0:32:05] <wibbwobbler> heck yeah
[0:32:11] <Applecannon63> Give us furry triggers
[0:32:18] <%chosenjuan42> Daredevil has the opposite of super eyes
[0:32:20] <Blank9> hell, have more monsters inside be like migi in Parasyte
[0:32:25] <%TubeMan642> DIESEL
[0:32:25] <+Dova573> @Kriss1827 Well i feel thats more like a spidey sense
[0:32:25] <Blank9> where they're also there
[0:32:25] <%Terracora> What about stands what have swords? is that making swords cool or stands less cool?
[0:32:28] <dreadedcthulhu> is it scryed or ess-CRY-ed?
[0:32:30] <rusell4> @datasuna zd
[0:32:53] <+dmtjinni> Woolz will Figuare it Out
[0:32:53] <+Dova573> @JaseAdrift We dont know yet, for all we know is just a scar
[0:32:56] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @terracora is it a normal sword or a cool sword
[0:33:09] <%ozzrabbit> S-Cry-Ed? Wow, that‚Äôs a pull you don‚Äôt see too often.
[0:33:22] <+Drunkengen> Rider Kick?
[0:33:25] <brachydios777> I will never accept Blaze blue ad Blae blue
[0:33:28] <%Prevot> @Dova573 Viola / Violet has an eye power
[0:33:31] <brachydios777> *as
[0:33:38] <Applecannon63> Rider Kicks at least have variety
[0:33:39] <+ZoltanBMagnus> One trope that I will never tire of is "old badasses". The ones that survived through a tough world are the best
[0:33:45] <SomersaultJustice> I thought it was pronounced "screed"
[0:33:51] <%Terracora> @cobalt_phoenix_ Normal sword but it's a part of the stand. Like silver chariot
[0:34:01] <+Andrizzleton> surprised woolie isn't partnered with Breath of the Waifu
[0:34:05] <Applecannon63> Ffrom Flying kicks to roundhouses and rising knee kicks
[0:34:05] <andre11dr> Maybe Gon in 60 seconds will give you some of these concepts done really good Kappa
[0:34:05] <DatAsuna> brb ripping off jack at the end of the world
[0:34:10] <%chosenjuan42> DIO has super eyes
[0:34:25] <+Dova573> @Prevot fuck you right forgot about her powers
[0:34:53] <Applecannon63> also Kamen Riders have multiple finishers from punch,kick,shooting to slash and thrust
[0:34:55] <niddron> he said it! writers are failed artist
[0:34:57] <RunoEddie> fanfics will always exist
[0:35:21] <%Seancicle> W
[0:35:23] <JaseAdrift> Nice idea... I think ill take it
[0:35:28] <$BallerSwagBro9k> LETSA GO
[0:35:29] <@Menitta> I made this
[0:35:33] <%Terracora> We need more female Woolie
[0:35:34] <Applecannon63> and Kamen riders with clock ups and reprogramming shit
[0:35:36] <bing_commander> Woolie says:oc don‚Äôt steal
[0:35:37] <wibbwobbler> NEW OC DO NOT STEAL
[0:35:41] <Yung_Booker> you made this?
[0:35:41] <DatAsuna> Check out my new totally original comic "jim at the end of the universe"
[0:35:41] <brachydios777> When was the last time there was a fanfic that was genuinely good?
[0:35:48] <Yung_Booker> I made this
[0:35:52] <@Menitta> I like the trope of hex weapons
[0:35:55] <+jiggy_snipe> Glaives are cooler anyway
[0:36:03] <$BallerSwagBro9k> HALBERD GANG
[0:36:07] <%Seancicle> We know
[0:36:09] <JaseAdrift> its a GUN
[0:36:10] <green_skeleton> the sword is the noble weapon, tho @WoolieVersus
[0:36:11] <%Mr_Strut> Fuck swords and spears, give flail
[0:36:12] <dreadedcthulhu> STICK AND ROCK
[0:36:14] <DatAsuna> A point on a stick is effective and cheap
[0:36:14] <clack14> long gun

[0:36:37] <Applecannon63> FTW
[0:36:41] <%Prevot> spear is the actual IRL basic bitch weapon, instead of swords as fiction shows
[0:36:41] <DatAsuna> We didn't hunt mamoths with swords
[0:36:43] <+MajorCrasher> spears are the basic bitch weapon. swords are popular because they're cooler and rarer
[0:36:45] <DatAsuna> We used fuckin' spears
[0:36:46] <%Terracora> Sharp stick > Super powers
[0:36:58] <%chosenjuan42> the legendary stick
[0:37:01] <TheAdMerlin> Celts and Greeks loved spears, it was Romans who pushed swords for summer slam
[0:37:02] <revoltingimp> Yeah, cause you wouldnt fucking walk around town casually with a long fucking spear
[0:37:05] <+Drunkengen> Power Pole
[0:37:07] <andre11dr> Or just have a gun and ignore all of that shit

[0:37:12] <DatAsuna> Being able to throw a spear is way more OP
[0:37:14] <bing_commander> Guns are better
[0:37:14] <$BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[0:37:23] <niddron> he be going
[0:37:27] <%Mr_Strut> You gonna tell an angel what kind of weapon it can use?
[0:37:31] <%chosenjuan42> put a gun at the end of a spear
[0:37:31] <fernandapsdois> no protagonist will have a spear nobody wants a zoner to be the main character
[0:37:32] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @BallerSwagBro9k
[0:37:35] <prime_name> Woolie vs Swords
[0:37:35] <%Prevot> @DatAsuna yeah but now you've got no weapon anymore
[0:37:36] <+Bajimxenn> dee
[0:37:36] <+deviljhojho_> pretty kool
[0:37:42] <+jiggy_snipe> aren't angels just humans without angel shit?
[0:37:43] <DatAsuna> David and goliath is the basically the equiv of bringing a gun to a fistfight
[0:37:43] <HollowMan190> he's going again
[0:37:47] <cipher758> from sticks to the atom bomb. humans leveled up too hard
[0:37:48] <andre11dr> Angels didn't knew about guns, even though they should know everything...
[0:37:49] <+Dova573> Obviously angels gave us swords Kappa
[0:37:52] <Applecannon63> Doesn't the Kami Izanagi have a spear that created Japan
[0:37:54] <shadowcrisis> and now come forth my children, pastor woolie is preaching the word
[0:37:55] <@Menitta> God was uncreative as fuck
[0:37:55] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Adam and Eve wouldn't even know what a spear is LUL
[0:37:57] <sendart> DONT BE AFRAID
[0:37:59] <Marc_The_Frog > to be fair, I would name any sturdy piece of wood with optional attached piece of hard thing on end be the image of evolved human violence
[0:38:01] <velgaduere> what a narcissist
[0:38:01] <%Mr_Strut> God basically just made Earth as his self-insert fanfic
[0:38:02] <+Andrizzleton> Or was god shaped in the image of man LUL
[0:38:02] <chll0ne> BIBLE CALL OUTS
[0:38:04] <bing_commander> Maybe angels are like liquid metal man
[0:38:04] <+linSP> Is woolie trying to say angels are eldritch beings
[0:38:05] <niddron> what if we're god's anime?
[0:38:11] <stranger59> Flaming Bat'leth
[0:38:13] <phantomsleeves> i like reggie‚Äôs purple shirt
[0:38:16] <DatAsuna> @Prevot but now you're dead, or still far enough away for the hunter to out-run you. Projectiles are what let humans rise up.
[0:38:16] <brachydios777> BE NOT AFRAID
[0:38:19] <%BinaryFireball> angels are fucked up
[0:38:20] <%kyh9> The Angels were built in the image of cool

[1:04:33] <dots4eyes> If they added a speen to that jumping axe it would have been so much cooler
[1:04:34] <joshua_42> Kotal
[1:04:34] <bhaysic> Frost looks lame tbh'
[1:04:38] <+Doc1790> Necalli
[1:04:38] <sackerkappa> Frost just wants to get over but Creative has nothing for her.
[1:04:38] <jorniev> necali

[1:58:58] <+the22cstomp> elder gun
[1:59:01] <danknugglit> Elder gun
[1:59:02] <+TopTierHarley> they are Demi gods
[1:59:04] <RyuuAoi> Strong combos
[1:59:08] <yusefHD> @yusefHD Only the finest dorito pope endorsed RTX
[1:59:08] <pjbuster> if samurai jack can have a gun, so can fujin
[1:59:08] <Manmush> like bows
[1:59:14] <%DiscoMatador> I must consult the ELDER GUN
[1:59:16] <biggdaddymike> Fujin is no elder God, so he's not completely useless
[1:59:16] <%LordSDB> Yeah but Kronika hasn't fucked everyone over for the entire series (game wise, not story wise)
[1:59:16] <sonofthedeepsouth> COLLAPSE THOSE LUNGS
[1:59:17] <mar_krow> fujin loves making love to humans so he picked up a few things
[1:59:18] <+Tucker0603> @woolieversus crossbow is the oldest gun
[1:59:22] <RyuuAoi> 2020 Elder Gods
[1:59:23] <+Memitim> Everyone in mk4 had a weapon, Fujin had a crossbow
[1:59:24] <teflonbilly777> @LordSDB Nobody is trusting him though. Everybody is waiting for his inevitable betrayal. Dude isn't even hiding his plans with his sneaky speaking
[1:59:25] <TigerClaws12> shut up tho
[1:59:28] <yusefHD> Protogun
[1:59:28] <%Terracora> Behold the power of my stand! GUN!
[1:59:30] <+TopTierHarley> he only has a crossbow
[1:59:30] <RunoEddie> Woolie, have you seen Fujin's ending in this game?
[1:59:31] <Infeirno23> "i really my wind powers, bit i need more range"
[1:59:36] <misterurbanthelegend> Saint of Killers.
[1:59:37] <yusefHD> Analog Gun.
[1:59:37] <peachy996> Maybe he likes the Crossbow
[1:59:43] <%LordSDB> @teflonbilly777 Yeah thats what I'm getting at
[1:59:43] <%PKSomething> It's only a crossbow, not a gun
[1:59:49] <SjoeB89> That fucking mobility
[1:59:52] <bazz_tv> Fujin is not an elder god though
[1:59:54] <yusefHD> "ex Bow"
[2:00:02] <+Shotgundam009> ow
[2:00:04] <dots4eyes> A crossbow is just a gun bow
[2:00:06] <Infeirno23> @misterurbanthelegend saint of killers would be a sick MK guest character
[2:00:08] <RyuuAoi> Fujin BROKEN AF
[2:00:21] <RyuuAoi> Mothafucka just walked on air.

[2:05:27] <Graxe_> And that's why the AI didn't do anything
[2:05:32] <+EdenOfLove> Yo use the assists with right stick

[2:47:07] <%Solidnick18> hmmmmmmm
[2:47:07] <+shivvey> She totally did
[2:47:09] <+wydamn> @biggdaddymike basically, never to be seen again for the rest of this timeline.
[2:47:09] <revoltingimp> NO LETS JUMP TO CONCLUSINOS
[2:47:13] <+TopTierHarley> should have used Sindel, there was more dialogue
[2:47:13] <+SvenHolgersson> I am pointing
[2:47:13] <+shivvey> KUNG LAO RIGHT
[2:47:14] <%LordSDB> KUNG LAO IS ALWAYS RIGHT THO!!!!!
[2:47:14] <RunoEddie> if you choose Sindel, she says that they will keep Johnny and Sonya alive to breed warriors...
[2:47:15] <biggdaddymike> Your mom is kind of sus Kitana
[2:47:15] <MichaelOfCainhurst> Let's jump to conclusions
[2:47:15] <bhaysic> Kung Lao just wanted to say she was dummy thicc
[2:47:15] <pjbuster> kung lao the best
[2:47:16] <teflonbilly777> @BallerSwagBro9k Yeah, why was that missing?
[2:47:16] <BlkFlameKami> poor kitana
[2:47:19] <centuronstar> Kung Lao: Called it
[2:47:20] <stranger59> Kung is the guy who gets voted off, but is always right.
[2:47:20] <gamewarden92> I was totally waiting for the breeding slave line
[2:47:22] <Graxe_> That line is only if you do the Johnny fight as Sindel
[2:47:25] <Lancaster_H> because they hugged
[2:47:26] <dots4eyes> Special Muther Forces
[2:47:27] <%LordSDB> Kung Lao has the right to be salty!
[2:47:28] <SjoeB89> Kung Lao is pure salt
[2:47:32] <teflonbilly777> @RunoEddie Ah, makes sense
[2:47:32] <jorniev> this is the darkest timeline
[2:47:38] <%alpacasintophats> so NOW we can jump to conclusions
[2:47:41] <Graxe_> "Let them fight"
[2:47:43] <TigerClaws12> keikaku
[2:47:44] <+Soliloquy123> "Mom didn't betray us." "Mom betrayed you." "Damn you Mom."
[2:47:47] <Shardlab> Kung Lao, just say "I told you so."
[2:47:47] <Manmush> god shes so ugly
[2:47:51] <biggdaddymike> Did she forget to put on some chapstick?
[2:47:51] <%afronooch> bro kronika needs some chap stick
[2:47:53] <+wydamn> I like how Kitana immediately gets it, and doesn't have to go through a mopey denial phase.

[3:05:57] <DatAsuna> It's less disrespect and more that if Kotal lives shit actually has to change
[3:05:58] <biggdaddymike> He'll be back on a wheelchair
[3:05:59] <bearwagon> Kotal has to job so Bring Me to Life can work
[3:05:59] <SirDonko> He'll be back to die again one day
[3:06:01] <MichaelOfCainhurst> LUL
[3:06:03] <teflonbilly777> Kotal is the buttmonkey of Mortal Kombat
[3:06:05] <+someyounguy1> oh man were still salty about kotal shiivsSalt shiivsSalt shiivsSalt shiivsSalt shiivsSalt
[3:06:05] <marsonred> Vegeta of Mortal Kombat
[3:06:08] <dots4eyes> They secretly just hate Woolie and just did it out of spite
[3:06:08] <derap41> Kotal got Cucked in 10 didn't he
[3:06:09] <%Josef_Stryker> Netherrealm must fight against Bring Me To Life
[3:06:11] <joshua_42> he‚Äôll be back to job again
[3:06:14] <sackerkappa> I mean... Kotal IS a racist towards Tarkatans, though. Racists are always bad guys.
[3:06:14] <peachy996> Ironic that they love Jacqui since most fans hate her
[3:06:14] <+Tiewolf> or the Va did not want to be casted again for the role
[3:06:15] <sologarza> NRS hates Aztecs :(
[3:06:16] <mike2hands> Khotal is the meat man of MK11
[3:06:19] <KingKZ> Kotal is the Yamcha of MK.
[3:06:22] <$tkuwari> Kotal took Shao Kahns place, he was fated to job
[3:06:24] <prime_name> JUST WALK, DON'T RUSH HIM
[3:06:27] <pjbuster> He SAID IT
[3:06:27] <+RealThiele> he said the line
[3:06:27] <misterurbanthelegend> Incans got a bad rep in fightung fames.
[3:06:28] <xigbarbar> are they playing thru as like, the 'evil' side? or is this just the MK11 story mode normally?
[3:06:29] <lazerscraper> No yamcha gets love
[3:06:29] <$BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[3:06:29] <%Josef_Stryker> HE SAID THE THING
[3:06:30] <mar_krow> reptile is in the progress of changing to onaga
[3:06:30] <+wydamn> @WoolieVersus to be fair, they were kind of treating Liu Kang the same way for a time.
[3:06:32] <revoltingimp> mmm that sneer on his face is so good
[3:06:34] <PanicSwytch> Fujii, u had plenty of time to stop him

[3:06:44] <$tkuwari> We expected you to kick our ass Sorceror!
[3:06:45] <+Ornightz> Kotal was Just Heading foward
[3:06:47] <dots4eyes> You taking the crown was expected...said Raiden
[3:06:55] <teflonbilly777> Zombie Liu Kang
[3:06:56] <%Asuterisuku> @TopTierHarley Jax, Kuai Liang, and Hasashi Hanzo is still a bigger number than Mileena and Baraka.
[3:06:59] <biggdaddymike> It took the deadly alliance to take Liu Kang down
[3:07:01] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @vaderxyz1970
[3:07:02] <MichaelOfCainhurst> Scorpion is the poster boy.
[3:07:04] <art__thief> Why doesn't anyone else learn soul magic? It's really OP.
[3:07:05] <Ion_Laser> @xigbarbar This is DLC that takes place after story mode
[3:07:14] <pjbuster> Dan Hibiki > Kotal khan
[3:07:15] <derap41> He doesn't deserve it
[3:07:15] <sackerkappa> Kotal Khan is BURIED by management CONFIRMED?
[3:07:15] <RunoEddie> Liu Kang was done right in MK11
[3:07:16] <xigbarbar> @Ion_Laser oohh okay okay, thank you.

[3:07:24] <%Javaa01> Shoulda picked a top tier
[3:07:25] <dots4eyes> Woolie killed Kotal
[3:07:26] <SirDonko> Who's Kotal anyways?
[3:07:28] <+wydamn> SHOULD HAVE picked a top tier
[3:07:30] <GarbageNirvana> Even in the comics he fucks up
[3:07:31] <%SleepyDavid> give it 8 more games, he'll turn around
[3:07:33] <DatAsuna> liu kang doesn' get it because he's still a hero no a shao khan replacement
[3:07:34] <+Kingtut9009> Kotal gets beat up by a thief with a bow
[3:07:34] <CursedNobleman> low tier trash
[3:07:35] <+chiazam> Character Switch
[3:07:35] <HalloweenHangover> Remember Kotal's reveal trailer was him jobbing to Jacqui?
[3:07:37] <teflonbilly777> And NecallI!

[3:07:39] <+RealThiele> kombat tag

[3:08:01] <DXLelouch24> For Now
[3:08:03] <DatAsuna> Like kitana doesn't get it as bad because kitana has a role besides khan to reset her to
[3:08:04] <OzzySnek> Kotal dying all the time means that the final timeline ends with him holding the reins of the Hourglass
[3:08:06] <KaiserMario> I think they Roman Reigns's Kotal early on, then aggressively backtracked it...
[3:08:07] <xigbarbar> yikes
[3:08:18] <derap41> nom nom nom

[3:26:23] <jimjamstrawberryslamalam> But sadly Liu's is better
[3:26:23] <dots4eyes> Let SUCC be known everywhere
[3:26:27] <+RealThiele> giant chair ending is eh
[3:26:29] <%doomerskeletor13> WOOLIE GOT BARS
[3:26:31] <misterurbanthelegend> Shang went from Jobbered by Quan-Chi to bigger than Shao Kahn and even Kronika. Its like UK Comics Starscream.
[3:26:33] <%CptnCampy61> Can Hit checkpoint and do other ending
[3:26:33] <$tkuwari> Kanon ending
[3:26:35] <big_jay_rock> woolies 21 savage is great
[3:26:37] <+Troispoint> Aftermath is surprisingly good
[3:26:37] <+TopTierHarley> just chapter select
[3:26:39] <RunoEddie> Kanon Ending time
[3:26:39] <andre11dr> F in chat for Kotal BibleThump
[3:26:40] <prime_name> Definitely the weakest of the Netherealm stories
[3:26:42] <yusefHD> new 21 Savage album on Friday Savage mode to featuring Morgan Freeman and an egg
[3:26:46] <Terrarp> rap from the toughest streets of London
[3:26:47] <BlackermanZX> Kotal jobbed even in another timeline
[3:26:47] <+EdenOfLove> 6
[3:26:47] <%Theycallmenerf> Woolie 236 savage
[3:26:49] <peachy996> It's a whole mess
[3:26:51] <+EdenOfLove> Six realms
[3:26:52] <+wydamn> I actually didn't care too much for the Liu Kang ending. Feels too much like a "get ready for the next DLC"
[3:26:54] <RunoEddie> Weakest?! This is fucking GREAT!
[3:26:55] <peachy996> 6 Big Realms basically
[3:26:59] <gnarly_memes_bro> @doomerskeletor13 ok so there's no clean cut way to tell where it'll go from here
[3:27:02] <xigbarbar> this is my first time viewing one of woolie's streams, this was cool.
[3:27:04] <+Troispoint> @prime_name I thought the story made much more sense as a reset than whatever 11 left off with
[3:27:05] <CraZ80> @WoolieVersus 21 crumpets
[3:27:08] <eldragon_1> Now do Kotal ending Kappa
[3:27:09] <+jiggy_snipe> Liu Kang's is another reboot
[3:27:10] <Bloodhit> Can't believe how bad their music choice for anything MK related since X is
[3:27:11] <+kawachipto> @wydamn or the next game...
[3:27:13] <misterurbanthelegend> This Story is Trash.
[3:27:17] <+RealThiele> this is just a canon reset to fix story
[3:27:22] <redrins> he is now a child playing with his legos
[3:27:23] <DatAsuna> He's the least creative god ever
[3:27:24] <+TopTieramisu> mk lore doesn't make sense
[3:27:27] <revoltingimp> oh wow that Erran Black fatality
[3:27:30] <jimjamstrawberryslamalam> @wydamn True I can understand that Kung lao has DLC lmao!
[3:27:30] <gnarly_memes_bro> so basically anything goes for MK12
[3:27:37] <%doomerskeletor13> I was under the impression he was just fucking with current stuff
[3:27:38] <Furbylon> Everything is irrelevant
[3:27:38] <$tkuwari> I will be a big man - man with literal omnipotence
[3:27:39] <%Javaa01> Now that they've done timelines, now they can bring in multiverse BS
[3:27:42] <peachy996> He wasn't creating he was just conquering what was left of the realms
[3:27:42] <%LordSDB> Yup he blows your brains out Kappa
[3:27:44] <alephalpha> he has no imagination
[3:27:44] <yusefHD> this guy is probably really good at making Vizio charts
[3:27:50] <%mikesapartment> he literally just wants to be a generic villain
[3:27:53] <RunoEddie> Aftermath is so entertaining, Shang Tsung is the best
[3:27:54] <DatAsuna> MK, boring and uncreative? say it ain't so
[3:28:01] <%Theycallmenerf> MK11 the big succ
[3:28:04] <andre11dr> Don't worry about it
[3:28:05] <+THE_CYB3R_FOX> Shang stopped Kronika before she reversed time
[3:28:09] <SjoeB89> Paltry
[3:28:09] <+Troispoint> A minute of silence for the traumatized employees who looked up gore for the ART
[3:28:12] <MichaelOfCainhurst> But he wants to rule
[3:28:12] <penitentpentwitch> Wasn't that a storyline for 'God Joker'?
[3:28:13] <dots4eyes> Shang Tsung is great..but his plan is SUCC
[3:28:13] <+TopTierHarley> not ruling
[3:28:14] <+KillMeImHere> he just wanted everyone's souls first i guess
[3:28:16] <Terrarp> Is Dreamland going to be conquered?
[3:28:19] <+THE_CYB3R_FOX> But I guess I could change time
[3:28:19] <SjoeB89> Same thing happened to Thanos
[3:28:21] <%LordSDB> Well you should def check out his arcade endin
[3:28:22] <%JetpackMcQuack> Damn hackers ruin all the fun
[3:28:28] <+Shotgundam009> Let him have his minions
[3:28:28] <+TopTierHarley> conquer to flex power
[3:28:30] <%LordSDB> It has a lot more going on
[3:28:30] <%Asuterisuku> Tsung never rewound the clock, because that wasn't his goal.
[3:28:34] <+linSP> ‚ÄúI want the same, but I wanna be bigger‚Äù
[3:28:35] <joshua_42> Kirby would destroy Shang Tsung
[3:28:35] <$tkuwari> Kirbo will fight shang tsung
[3:28:37] <pjbuster> when succ so much you can't succ no more
[3:28:39] <+TopTierHarley> All Shang wants it power
[3:28:42] <$BallerSwagBro9k> He will probably get bored eventually
[3:28:45] <BlackermanZX> all this kotal jobbing
[3:28:45] <prime_name> Now I am the big SUCC
[3:28:48] <revoltingimp> ... chapter select
[3:28:49] <+wydamn> all this WIFE
[3:28:49] <SjoeB89> Thanos gave up the gauntlet in the comics for the same reason. He didn't feel up to it.
[3:28:54] <%Theycallmenerf> Is Shang the Vergil of MK?
[3:28:55] <WakeUpThrow> Shang Tsung's copy ability would just be copy again
[3:28:58] <xigbarbar> it was kinda funny how he just opened his eyes and they were the same.
[3:28:59] <$tkuwari> I will rewrite the universe so that Kotal doesn't job
[3:29:00] <%LordSDB> Check Scorpian ending as well as Shang's
[3:29:00] <+kawachipto> Shang just wanted to be better at basketball
[3:29:02] <+RealThiele> or he pulls a superior spiderman after he gets bored
[3:29:05] <+TopTierHarley> Why would he get bored
[3:29:05] <DatAsuna> *cough* dragon's dogma
[3:29:08] <xigbarbar> like enjoy more of that for the rest of eternity, bro
[3:29:09] <joshua_42> Nah Vergil is more interesting than Shang
[3:29:13] <PanicSwytch> This dlc is just alot of choking and sucking
[3:29:13] <+Troispoint> Being a God should mean you don't see time the same way, so it should be fine
[3:29:14] <jorniev> my hope is that they make a new chaos realm character, instead of having fucking havik representing it .
[3:29:14] <T_Sasquatch> He became a God to make shaolin monks 2
[3:29:17] <revoltingimp> Here we go boys!
[3:29:18] <misterurbanthelegend> Preacher shot outs.

[3:29:42] <misterurbanthelegend> Preacher shout outs.
[3:29:47] <DatAsuna> nah, same as the old one
[3:29:49] <%Livelinne> !uptime
[3:29:49] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 30 minutes
[3:29:51] <%Solidnick18> decide the 1 destiny
[3:29:53] <+wydamn> I mean, eventually Shang Tsung would just de-power himself and re-fight them all as a personal challenge, and that's how the timeline restarts
[3:29:56] <%dekkitout> Mortal Kombat: Sekret Warz
[3:29:58] <WakeUpThrow> Havik was the best character out of the PS2 games though
[3:30:03] <pjbuster> remember meat?
[3:30:03] <%Theycallmenerf> Brand new characters would have me hyped
[3:30:14] <$tkuwari> Remember Mokap
[3:30:14] <RunoEddie> chew that scenary!
[3:30:17] <joshua_42> Bring Strkyer back
[3:30:18] <+TopTierHarley> you forget that Shang only wants power
[3:30:26] <RunoEddie> he beat Kronika before
[3:30:26] <SjoeB89> He beat Kronika
[3:30:28] <prime_name> Don't worry about it
[3:30:28] <+EdenOfLove> I mean he beat Kronika the first time
[3:30:31] <+chiazam> I'd say they're even
[3:30:36] <yusefHD> Remember mokap LUL LUL
[3:30:36] <peachy996> It's still Liu Kang who is typically stronger than Shang
[3:30:37] <DatAsuna> Yeah he's just doing it again
[3:30:40] <RunoEddie> also Chosen One destiny power
[3:30:46] <andre11dr> Now press forward x a lot
[3:30:47] <stranger59> Lui Kang has been killing guys he had no right killing from day one.
[3:30:48] <DatAsuna> that was fast
[3:30:48] <big_jay_rock> easy work
[3:30:59] <peachy996> In spite of all those powerups throughout story, it's still just Liu vs Shang
[3:31:02] <revoltingimp> meterburn the bicycle kick YEAH!
[3:31:04] <+TopTierHarley> He absolutely gets pleasure
[3:31:15] <derap41> Shang just wants to create Free Gay space Communism
[3:31:27] <penitentpentwitch> But "The Dead Speak"!
[3:31:39] <%Solidnick18> dragoon
[3:31:41] <prime_name> No but evil ending
[3:31:45] <+RealThiele> if everyone is dead noone can worship him, and he cannot compare himself against others
[3:31:50] <Esparsenior> I think he just keeps writing time where he gets to keep betraying and conquering then backtracks time to do it again. Forever @woolieversus
[3:31:51] <DatAsuna> as it should be
[3:31:58] <dots4eyes> I would have rather he have a literal Dragon Punch
[3:32:02] <$tkuwari> shang just disappears i guess
[3:32:03] <big_jay_rock> light work
[3:32:08] <%Asuterisuku> Literally. Destiny, decided.

[3:35:36] <+linSP> Finally, Luigi gets his game
[3:35:38] <SjoeB89> They made a tv show about that
[3:35:41] <revoltingimp> Which means it's gonna be hella lame, cause the tell is always cooler sounding than the show
[3:35:42] <yusefHD> you would think that if he would be responsible for time he might just stop all the necessary tournaments just saying..
[3:35:46] <DatAsuna> Mk12 is just gonna be kung lao fighting quan chi and shao kahn
[3:35:47] <dots4eyes> We need to see how rad OG Kung Lao is
[3:35:50] <%CptnCampy61> Really like that ending
[3:35:55] <alephalpha> hell no
[3:35:56] <Heyestus> Old era means no modern tech tho
[3:35:57] <Blank9> mortal kombat konuest is the tv show and it's legit on par with the first movie
[3:35:57] <Terrarp> would we get kid Shao Khan?
[3:35:59] <penitentpentwitch> Don't Bastion it!
[3:36:01] <alephalpha> eliminate all suffering
[3:36:02] <%doomerskeletor13> Gee, I wonder what ending is canon Kappa
[3:36:03] <DatAsuna> hell no
[3:36:04] <+TopTieramisu> üëÅ üëÅ

[3:36:05] <pjbuster> I'd make changes
[3:36:06] <prime_name> Make changes
[3:36:07] <OldOnyx> MK Conquest Kappa
[3:36:07] <DatAsuna> now sucks
[3:36:07] <%0ctaeder> could we start a poll or something for shaolin monks?
[3:36:10] <%DukeBlack_> the same with some changes
[3:36:11] <dreadedcthulhu> world a shit
[3:36:13] <MichaelOfCainhurst> He can't remove all the evil
[3:36:14] <BlackermanZX> I REVIVE METAL GEAR
[3:36:16] <dreadedcthulhu> gotta fix
[3:36:16] <%Solidnick18> idk everything sucks
[3:36:18] <DXLelouch24> Trump loses
[3:36:19] <derap41> Would you kill hitler?
[3:36:22] <Daxalog> Go for the Jax ending. New Wakanda
[3:36:23] <Ids560> fuckin change everything
[3:36:23] <%Prevot> there would have to be A sub-zero and scorpion
[3:36:23] <sendart> id make furries real LUL
[3:36:24] <+TopTieramisu> maybe he'll train the great kung lao so he doesn't lose to goro
[3:36:24] <T_Sasquatch> Make as many changes as possible for fub
[3:36:24] <marsonred> cat girls
[3:36:26] <T_Sasquatch> Fub
[3:36:29] <DatAsuna> fuck slight changes
[3:36:30] <T_Sasquatch> Fun fuck
[3:36:32] <+Tiewolf> Like Cage and Sonya Meeting Yes
[3:36:32] <+Taglog7> Give Konami to Capcom
[3:36:33] <+jiggy_snipe> it depends on when you make the change
[3:36:33] <+Ornightz> They want to reimagine the characters
[3:36:34] <misterurbanthelegend> To be fair TMNT reboots all the tymez.
[3:36:34] <DatAsuna> you're a GOD
[3:36:36] <DatAsuna> go ham
[3:36:36] <andre11dr> I would probably be a huge asshole and make it al in my image
[3:36:36] <%Solidnick18> a small change can fuck something
[3:36:37] <+jiggy_snipe> like how far back
[3:36:37] <%CptnCampy61> Hit Shuffle
[3:36:38] <BlackermanZX> I would make MVC4 real
[3:36:40] <@Menitta> I have one slight change. Jars are easier to open.
[3:36:41] <HelluvaNohbody> Mechs will be real
[3:36:41] <capnunderoos> Well, when Ben 10 remade the universe, he made it nearly identical as the original @WoolieVersus
[3:36:42] <%ZweihanderSteve> I want to go back in time so I didn't shit my pants in high school
[3:36:43] <%Asuterisuku> Define "Just."
[3:36:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> I wonder if Woolie played through Raiden's Arcade Mode ending.
[3:36:50] <derap41> Speed of light is no 3 M7s
[3:36:51] <+jiggy_snipe> now we're lizard people Kappa
[3:36:53] <+Shotgundam009> First things first monster girls everywhere
[3:36:53] <Ids560> those are the same thing
[3:36:53] <teflonbilly777> It feels like Liu Kang just chose a point in time to be the new starting point/present
[3:36:54] <capnunderoos> yes, ben 10 remade the universe at one point
[3:36:55] <+MTLxSpider> bring bac dinosaurs
[3:36:55] <@Menitta> Also 77+33 = 100
[3:36:55] <+Troispoint> We could giant frogs in a different relaity!
[3:37:00] <BlackermanZX> Also i would prevent the 3rd Birthday
[3:37:00] <T_Sasquatch> I'd keep fucking with it like a tv show
[3:37:00] <+Troispoint> could be*
[3:37:01] <prime_name> Brains in the cosmic gas?
[3:37:03] <%Prevot> single realm with all the weird people and creatures
[3:37:03] <capnunderoos> watch ben 10, yall. ben 10 is rad
[3:37:04] <@Menitta> thats the change
[3:37:05] <PanicSwytch> Order and Chaos is never ending. You can never be just without taking freedom of will
[3:37:07] <%doomerskeletor13> Woolie creates a world of Sheevas
[3:37:09] <fangovafang> Awoken lol
[3:37:10] <$tkuwari> catgirls are real now
[3:37:11] <%dekkitout> @capnunderoos I friggin forgot about that and how it came to bite him in the ass
[3:37:16] <%Solidnick18> anyways this story sucks

[3:41:34] <Flarepulse> Enforce the power of perspective upon all
[3:41:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> CommanderSqueaks subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months, currently on a 8 month streak! If you see the Arcade endings, it becomes pretty clear that control over time doesn't make you a CREATOR, but it does give you significant influence over events. The same people, same planets, same species, but the events they experience can be changed.
[3:41:39] <$BallerSwagBro9k> CREATE A CLEAN LIMITLESS FUEL
[3:41:40] <PanicSwytch> So dinosaurs and floating brains

[3:41:57] <Esparsenior> I‚Äôd just make the world the same and just change time for the better as the world turns.
[3:41:58] <+Rabbitmage> Better technology would just accelerator our own destruction
[3:42:02] <BlackermanZX> Or use magic as power source
[3:42:04] <dots4eyes> More SUCC basically
[3:42:05] <marsonred> Make Sheeva real
[3:42:06] <dreadedcthulhu> the real thing is just granting everyone immortality

[3:42:23] <derap41> Wooie perpetual motion leads to infinite black holes
[3:42:31] <deltanova11> woolie wants our souls to no longer be bound by gravity
[3:42:39] <stranger59> Just give us the Star Trek timeline
[3:42:39] <%DukeBlack_> and then you create something for them to fight
[3:42:42] <Furbylon> Making ape escape 4 a reality is the real change that should be discussed
[3:42:45] <DatAsuna> nah conflict is cool
[3:42:45] <Applecannon63> sometimes fuck gravity
[3:42:45] <derap41> Emphatic telepathy
[3:42:47] <Bloodhit> That just Naruto Chakra Woolie

[3:42:49] <+Shotgundam009> HELL YEAH
[3:42:50] <+jiggy_snipe> Kappa
[3:42:50] <DatAsuna> Empath
[3:42:52] <+wydamn> @Menitta if you think about it, physics are just based on a bunch of variables. Gravity, speed of light, etc.

[3:43:13] <Applecannon63> @cptbritches I mean I wouldn't mind the extra arms
[3:43:14] <+RealThiele> noone could be trusted with time powers
[3:43:14] <+TopTierHarley> no one wants the burden of being an empath
[3:43:14] <%Asuterisuku> Reggie would forbit hentai confirmed.
[3:43:14] <$serpenttucker> I will do everything. Keep everything the same, and then get bored with it, and then mold my own world, and then get bored with ha

[3:43:26] <xigbarbar> Good Guy Woolie
[3:43:29] <DatAsuna> This is actually a story I was working on lol
[3:43:30] <PanicSwytch> Woolie would definitely create all the kyubi's
[3:43:32] <%TheEpicTree> "Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you. And if you do nothing, they lose hope. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all." - God from Futurama
[3:43:41] <sendart> Our souls won't be weighed down by gravity
[3:43:46] <+wydamn> It's like that hentai where every woman has a humongous dick and everyone's just okay with that.
[3:43:52] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @GManx0 Jetpacks and punchgirls for everyone BUT everyone fights all the time like River City
[3:43:53] <bxdragon> Woolie is going into Newtype bullshit

[3:44:30] <+jiggy_snipe> Woolie's cult
[3:44:31] <andre11dr> Woolie is thinking way too kindly about this, I'll would totally just be a huge asshole and be like "no ,mine though"
[3:44:33] <$BallerSwagBro9k> UNIVERSAL TRUTH woolie
[3:44:35] <dreadedcthulhu> THE CHURCH OF ABSOLUTE TRUTH
[3:44:38] <+jiggy_snipe> the Cult of Universal Trush

[3:44:51] <revoltingimp> aren't they making one?
[3:44:52] <%Prevot> there could totally be a good MK movie
[3:44:54] <derap41> It wouldn't work for non fans
[3:44:56] <Terrarp> The Cult thing is happening again
[3:44:58] <thelivingglitch307> @TheEpicTree that show was too good
[3:44:58] <xigbarbar> I'm pretty sure there is a new MK movie in the works though?
[3:45:00] <%dekkitout> 2 things in my perfect works, bending and spiral power- what could go wrong? Kappa
[3:45:00] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Make it maximum cheese

[3:45:28] <+wydamn> @TheOneCalledRock I'm not sure if I should elaborate or just leave it at that.
[3:45:29] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @revoltingimp
[3:45:30] <+Shotgundam009> Its great because its stupid
[3:45:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> Reggie you know not what you ask

[3:45:49] <Vyneci> Who would you cast as kotal?
[3:45:50] <+jiggy_snipe> that is such a weird pull LUL
[3:45:50] <RunoEddie> this is fine, but give us more!

[3:46:39] <%Livelinne> woolieSPICE woolieKICKDAD woolieONEGUY
[3:46:43] <%LordSDB> No, the usual what if's @WoolieVersus
[3:46:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> The normal ones, they help flesh out what having Time God powers actually entails.
[3:46:47] <+wydamn> @WoolieVersus each character gets their own ending about what they would do if they got time powers
[3:46:47] <Terrarp> The Rock as Shao jobbing Sean Bean as Kotal
[3:46:49] <+Taglog7> Silverhand Silverhand Silverhand
[3:46:51] <andre11dr> Could just do Spawn or someone that isn't in the story @woolieversus
[3:46:52] <jorniev> i am that guy
[3:46:55] <DatAsuna> when's the stage play?
[3:47:03] <%Prevot> that first MK movie WAS the best game adaptation until Detective Pikachu
[3:47:03] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:47:16] <OldOnyx> this story almost fits as a prequel to the live action show LUL
[3:47:17] <%CptnCampy61> No it‚Äôs not
[3:47:25] <andre11dr> No ,fuck that
[3:47:32] <DatAsuna> I enjoy the yakuza movie it's dumb fun
[3:47:43] <prime_name> I was very hyped for the Bionicle movies
[3:47:45] <PanicSwytch> I'd rather get a TV series over a movie
[3:47:46] <andre11dr> Look at the Mario movie
[3:47:48] <%dekkitout> What's the final frontier now? Netflix animated adaptation?
[3:47:49] <%Irridium> shoutout to those awful live action anime movies. Except Gintama that was alright
[3:47:53] <andre11dr> LOOK AT IT
[3:47:59] <DatAsuna> I would rather have other shit I like become video games than any games I like become movies
[3:48:03] <+RealThiele> netflix adaptations LUL
[3:48:10] <SjoeB89> @DatAsuna But the Yakuza games were based on a pretty huge genre to begin with.
[3:48:10] <derap41> Money wise games are larger than moveies
[3:48:11] <xigbarbar> idk man i just like Fighty, even if it's dumb
[3:48:11] <+wydamn> I will still defend the Super Mario Bros movie.
[3:48:14] <%Asuterisuku> Only recently have video game movies been half decent.
[3:48:18] <Terrarp> Netflix Original show
[3:48:20] <jorniev> not the DOA movie that is perfect
[3:48:26] <SjoeB89> Facts
[3:48:27] <penitentpentwitch> It'll be curious if Theaters ever come back.
[3:48:29] <%Asuterisuku> Tekken was alright too.
[3:48:30] <andre11dr> I totally agree with Woolie
[3:48:35] <DatAsuna> @SjoeB89 most stories are derivative to varying degrees
[3:48:38] <%JetpackMcQuack> Directors get excited too I guess
[3:48:42] <jorniev> STILL waiting for that DMC animated show
[3:48:44] <T_Sasquatch> I think live action has its merits
[3:48:47] <%Prevot> but a movie could be cool so shut up woolie *shrug*
[3:48:51] <RunoEddie> it's different, back in the day you just couldn't tell this story in video games
[3:48:53] <%Asuterisuku> Dragon's Dogma just dropped.
[3:48:56] <RunoEddie> so you needed movies
[3:48:57] <cipher758> it's kind of funny, gaming is the biggest industry now. bigger than movies and music combined
[3:48:57] <DatAsuna> dmc anime happened already jorn
[3:48:59] <+Taglog7> Even Reboot Kappa Kappa Kappa
[3:49:03] <nickhavok> much rather have a series instead of an at max 2 hour movie
[3:49:07] <%JetpackMcQuack> throw a couple memes in a call it a stew
[3:49:09] <%Asuterisuku> Reboot Reboot when?
[3:49:17] <jorniev> the other animated show by the castlevania guys
[3:49:18] <+wah_ha_ha> Live Action Avatar Last Airbender definitely needed Sex Kappa
[3:49:19] <andre11dr> Shit like adapting Fallout is just the dumbest shit ever
[3:49:24] <derap41> Games are a bigger industry
[3:49:25] <+Taglog7> it happened and it was bad
[3:49:29] <SjoeB89> I never understood why Movies were the endgame. Especially now. Totally agree with Woolie.
[3:49:35] <%CptnCampy61> Nothing wrong with leaving things alone either
[3:49:46] <Terrarp> can't wait for the Wesker kids in the new Netflix show
[3:49:47] <RunoEddie> video games couldn't tell stories like this back then, so you needed movies, now it can
[3:49:52] <+Taglog7> ALITA THOOOOOO
[3:49:55] <SjoeB89> Damn right
[3:49:59] <penitentpentwitch> SAGA as a comic?
[3:50:02] <T_Sasquatch> Because movies were all people had before tv or streaming
[3:50:02] <dots4eyes> Watch Fall Guys get turned into an animated movie
[3:50:03] <@Menitta> Whens Crossbone Gundam tho
[3:50:03] <marsonred> there is a vagabond movie though
[3:50:03] <+jiggy_snipe> idk an Anime with the budget would be good
[3:50:08] <dreadedcthulhu> sounds like steel ball run
[3:50:09] <DatAsuna> How many great mangas have you seen with shit anime?
[3:50:13] <SjoeB89> Movies are not needed
[3:50:14] <+wydamn> I think it's less about the movies being good, and more about just having a movie exist as a cultural touchstone.
[3:50:20] <andre11dr> Jojo doesn't need no anime to become popular Kappa
[3:50:20] <DatAsuna> it happens a lot
[3:50:21] <+RealThiele> netflix castlevania started good its worn out its welcome and turning into generic fud
[3:50:26] <%Livelinne> OhMyDog OhMyDog OhMyDog
[3:50:27] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Its is rare that an adaption surpasses its source material
[3:50:29] <SjoeB89> Games are superior media at this point.
[3:50:29] <dreadedcthulhu> some of those panels and spreads are WILD and wouldn't make it to animation as well
[3:50:33] <+Taglog7> but spawn tho
[3:50:35] <jorniev> vagabond doesnt need an ending as an art exhibition
[3:50:48] <DarknutSha> No stone ocean haHAA
[3:50:55] <Terrarp> The Boys show is incredible and superior to the comics
[3:51:00] <andre11dr> Iet you want a Batman Beyond movie
[3:51:02] <OldManDeckardCain> sure would be nice if games stopped trying to be movies...
[3:51:08] <DatAsuna> lost planet movie any day now
[3:51:12] <RunoEddie> it's just an old mentality, because video games couldn't tell movie like stories by themselves, now they can
[3:51:14] <+Taithove> Mortal Kombat's influences are martial arts movies from the 60s and 70s, it's not surprising that it comes back around
[3:51:16] <+RealThiele> the boys comic just feels like torture porn
[3:51:17] <jorniev> what about videogame adaptations of books?
[3:51:17] <%Asuterisuku> There's apparently going to be announcements related to JoJo's anime and manga in April. Stone Ocean 2021?
[3:51:22] <T_Sasquatch> The actual the boys comic is so fucking edgy
[3:51:33] <@Menitta> The final step is getting your thing to become a Tom Cruise movie.
[3:51:33] <%dekkitout> @andre11dr Yous tellin mes that you don't want to se how the mouth works in live action?
[3:51:34] <xigbarbar> @WoolieVersus You make a really good point about this too, because it feels like the emphasis on movies downplays other pieces of media like books, comics, etc.
[3:51:36] <DatAsuna> books are the best case for game adaptations
[3:51:43] <Terrarp> I tried reading the Boys and yes is torture, it just gets worse and worse
[3:51:46] <Daxalog> Woolie will figure it out: Adaptations
[3:51:48] <Mr_Rakjo> Push got a Comic
[3:51:59] <Mr_Rakjo> it was better than the movie lol
[3:52:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> Reggie you sweet summer child.
[3:52:10] <stardustcrusad3r> reggie is cool
[3:52:17] <T_Sasquatch> To be fair movie licensed games have low investment
[3:52:18] <SjoeB89> Books are seen as superior to everything
[3:52:22] <SjoeB89> even now
[3:52:28] <@Menitta> And that;s bullshir
[3:52:29] <%Irridium> shoutout to the ancient greeks who would shit-talk books
[3:52:33] <jorniev> people talked shit about reading too much
[3:52:33] <%dekkitout> "These book things mark the downfall of humanity"
[3:52:35] <+wydamn> Movies are for secondarys
[3:52:39] <prime_name> "True" acting my ass
[3:52:39] <+Taglog7> this isn't true streaming
[3:52:44] <andre11dr> @dekkitout Oh no ,i totally want it ,Im really afraid it would suck tho because DC movies are inconsistent
[3:52:44] <Terrarp> X-men Origins Wolverine, the videogame is amazing compared to whatever that movie was
[3:52:51] <%JetpackMcQuack> Quit writing my words down whipMad
[3:53:01] <@Menitta> books are lame. thats my hot take
[3:53:01] <+mickers> this is why we should all respect tiktok, wait
[3:53:02] <BlackermanZX> just like old anime and old videogames
[3:53:03] <+EdenOfLove> @woolieversus Does Kingdom Hearts count as the best movie based video game considering its based on all the Disney movies?
[3:53:16] <+RealThiele> Batman NES
[3:53:41] <derap41> Hey Woolie they added Halloween Costumes to MK11 FYi
[3:53:55] <@Menitta> video games in particular have such high potential with added interactivity I find
[3:53:58] <+MTLxSpider> jackie chan fist of fire
[3:53:58] <andre11dr> Boomers are always quick to shit on new things because they refuse to understand it
[3:54:19] <+Taglog7> Kreygasm Jackie Chan advetures reboot
[3:54:19] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1310937719246385153?s=19
[3:54:22] <+Shotgundam009> Nier <3
[3:54:27] <@Menitta> Nier Automata could not have been anything but a video game
[3:54:31] <derap41> Fart smelling movie makers
[3:54:34] <+RealThiele> humans in general are quick to hate what they dont understand, its a lizard brain reaction
[3:54:38] <%JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[3:54:42] <+TenguGemini> same with undertale
[3:54:48] <xigbarbar> Movies are peek crapitalism
[3:54:48] <prime_name> On the flip side, Videogames have a higher potential to flop on their stories/interactivity
[3:54:50] <+Taglog7> Pork?
[3:55:24] <misterurbanthelegend> wise words woolsworth.
[3:55:42] <%TheEpicTree> I think people want to get their work adapted into movie because it introduces a massive amount of people to their work, and if only a small fraction of those people look at the original work then that would still increase in the amount of people who would want to see the original work.
[3:55:48] <SjoeB89> But why should a remake be completely faithful?? Shouldn't that be an avenue for change?
[3:55:48] <andre11dr> Like i think we all love Cowboy Bebop, I would never want a live action or fucking movie, it's why those Disney live action movies bother me so much
[3:55:53] <derap41> This game could have been a 3 hour movie but no one that hasn't played the game would have understood anythiung
[3:55:56] <%Asuterisuku> Who watches the Watchmen?
[3:56:09] <+zero_jacks> this is a good podcast, tbh i go by this normally. when anything gets an adaptation i just wait to see the 50/50 if it lives or dies. alot more eyes on something could be bad sometimes
[3:56:17] <derap41> There is the Youtube animated Comics
[3:56:18] <OzzySnek> Never seen teh film, just got the comic book and reading it.
[3:56:21] <+Reco08> Oh hey, Mortal Kombat. Neat, who are you playing @WoolieVersus ?
[3:56:23] <art__thief> Did you her Tom Hallond is gonna be in the new Spider-Man game? lol
[3:56:38] <xigbarbar> Movies also feel like you're obligated to see them sometimes in order to keep up with society
[3:56:39] <andre11dr> It's like "cartoons are baby shit, it needs to be reeaaalll maaann" and i say FUCK THAT
[3:56:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> Giant blue dong
[3:56:40] <SjoeB89> @Reco08 They just finished
[3:56:40] <+RealThiele> in a corporate world massive success can cause somethings immediate downfall
[3:56:41] <%Asuterisuku> Alan Moore is a graphic novel genius.
[3:56:44] <+Reco08> Aw man
[3:56:46] <+Reco08> I came in late.
[3:56:52] <@Menitta> movies are cool tho
[3:56:56] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL

[3:57:25] <+Deko_> cause china
[3:57:26] <prime_name> They weren't even reading, the page just had Taiwan on it
[3:57:29] <%cobalt_phoenix_> TAIWAN
[3:57:32] <OzzySnek> Oh hey Taiwan
[3:57:33] <+wydamn> They were banned for referring to Taiwan as a country, China does not like that.
[3:57:35] <xigbarbar> wtf
[3:57:36] <%paladinstarbuster> DIDNT EVEN SAY IT JUST SHOWED THE FLAG
[3:57:37] <+Williamld> Western Taiwan is jealous
[3:57:45] <+EdenOfLove> They got banned from YouTube for saying Taiwan? What???
[3:57:49] <BooitsDock> TAIWAN BabyRage CHINA DONT LIKE BabyRage
[3:57:51] <+linSP> TAIWAN DOES NOT EXIST
[3:57:54] <andre11dr> Cause China evil
[3:57:56] <Esparsenior> Weird, but everyone knows that Taiwan is its own country with its own flag
[3:57:59] <%Asuterisuku> Modern China is pretty shitty.
[3:58:02] <@Menitta> EMERGENCY MEETING
[3:58:02] <prime_name> Not Banned-Banned, just suspended
[3:58:04] <misterurbanthelegend> Taiwan is the new N Word.
[3:58:05] <%Javaa01> DISCUSS
[3:58:09] <BooitsDock> PWEAS DONT SAY TAIWAN BabyRage BabyRage BabyRage
[3:58:10] <%Livelinne> Taiwan really rhymes well with Nomber One
[3:58:12] <derap41> Ejects Raiden instead
[3:58:12] <cipher758> "western taiwan" lol
[3:58:13] <+RealThiele> china is trying to flex on the corporations balls to excise taiwan
[3:58:14] <bhaysic> push kotal for mk 12
[3:58:15] <Terrarp> un cool Taiwan doesn't like when you talk about Taiwan
[3:58:19] <%dekkitout> That Shang guy seems alright, I'll trust him with my- oh... OH NOOOO....
[3:58:20] <RunoEddie> their company suspended them because of chinese pressure
[3:58:30] <@Menitta> This message better be pretty good
[3:58:35] <andre11dr> Is that a reference or something
[3:58:42] <+jiggy_snipe> I hope he says wet fart
[3:58:45] <%SirGO0SE> DEEPEST CUT
[3:58:46] <bearwagon> goddammit LUL
[3:58:46] <%TheEpicTree> I couldn't believe Shang Sung betrayed everyone WutFace
[3:58:47] <Equirah> inb4 the message ruins it LUL
[3:58:50] <%dekkitout> That sounds like a group in Warriors
[3:58:50] <%Prevot> ghost babel Kreygasm
[3:59:00] <%Irridium> holy shit LUL
[3:59:02] <+Williamld> @Esparsenior The communist chinese government refuses to acknowledge Taiwan's independence
[3:59:03] <prime_name> I thought it was referencing to Viper the rapper
[3:59:06] <+ManOfReason> The deepest pull
[3:59:06] <T_Sasquatch> That's a pull
[3:59:11] <+StooEsq> Ghost Babel is a solid Metal Gear
[3:59:15] <@Menitta> thats true actually
[3:59:18] <DatAsuna> oh no it's shadow chie
[3:59:26] <DatAsuna> oh no it's shadow teddy
[3:59:26] <%Livelinne> shiaNerd
[3:59:26] <%Javaa01> Unless you're Guilty Gear and just say "fuck it"
[3:59:29] <Terrarp> striking while the iron became a pachinko machine
[3:59:29] <T_Sasquatch> Dbfz was pain
[3:59:30] <%Prevot> the lowest form of fighting game story is the infinite clone shit
[3:59:36] <gamewarden92> The RAGE from MKvsDC was funny
[3:59:38] <+RealThiele> possessed
[3:59:40] <RunoEddie> this one makes the most sense, you do NOT let Shang Tsung talk his way out of stuff
[3:59:41] <@Menitta> i still havent unlocked fucking 21 lmao
[3:59:41] <DatAsuna> oh no it's crystal sephioth
[3:59:53] <+wydamn> There also needs to be a LA Noire style interrogation sequence in place of a fight at some point
[3:59:55] <DatAsuna> Injustice 1 is meh injustice 2 is pretty based
[3:59:57] <T_Sasquatch> I literally only played it to unlock android 21
[3:59:59] <bhaysic> MK9 is still the best one
[4:00:04] <andre11dr> Injustice 2 is actually really good
[4:00:06] <prime_name> Aftermath is the weakest for me
[4:00:15] <andre11dr> Like maybe the best one
[4:00:26] <+jiggy_snipe> well story is low on the priority for fighting games
[4:00:29] <%Asuterisuku> They got Warner Bros. money and went for it.
[4:00:29] <+Javaa01> And also MK9 had the benefit of not being a total mess in terms of trying to do too many things at once
[4:00:37] <DatAsuna> Not Invented Here
[4:00:46] <RunoEddie> to me I like Aftermath almost as much as 9, the other 2 MKs I don't care much
[4:00:48] <+jiggy_snipe> the story doesn't make the community
[4:00:48] <Terrarp> wait, was Guilty Gear and Persona Arena story after MK 9?
[4:00:50] <zaonizame> I liked Rev 2 story
[4:00:51] <bhaysic> I wish MK focused more on the mechanics
[4:00:59] <%dekkitout> Soulnadoes are cool!
[4:01:13] <+RealThiele> every game tries to up the stakes until you get to universe altering powers then reset
[4:01:15] <@Menitta> Why did Xrd have a story cutscene with no fights lmao
[4:01:18] <%Prevot> Infinite was so fucking bad
[4:01:20] <eldragon_1> Shao Khan and Sindel tho
[4:01:21] <zaonizame> even thou they are just an anime movie but I liked it
[4:01:21] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:01:21] <+MajorCrasher> ROLLBACK
[4:01:26] <Aji__> mk11 switching away from the mkx meter/break system was a bad choice imo
[4:01:37] <+KillMeImHere> tekken 7
[4:01:59] <%Javaa01> The best stuff in SFV story was mostly just the Rashid interactions
[4:02:01] <+jiggy_snipe> someone put Woolie in a game to just job
[4:02:03] <@Menitta> Tekken 7's story has production
[4:02:03] <prime_name> You had a few pop-offs in the SF5 LP @WoolieVersus
[4:02:04] <jorniev> ZANGIEF TANKS A SWORD with MUSCLE
[4:02:04] <%Asuterisuku> Bring Me To Life has some ill effects.
[4:02:05] <RunoEddie> there are some parts in P4A that are REALLY, REALLY good, Labrys' story is heartbreaking
[4:02:06] <+wydamn> Nothing is as cool as Cody just being Cody.
[4:02:07] <andre11dr> I would say GG ,but then i remembered that the pachinko plot matters....
[4:02:08] <bhaysic> Tekken 7 had an awesome final boss
[4:02:09] <zaonizame> Tekken 7 was meeeh the last fight was great
[4:02:09] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus You got hype for Zangief blocking a sword with his pecs
[4:02:14] <+Deko_> tekken 7 story transitions into fights are kinda sick
[4:02:24] <yusefHD> for you rocket anything
[4:02:26] <%Asuterisuku> That moment in MvC made me hard pass on the game.
[4:02:30] <AlienHunterCyclone> @woolieversus Characters speaking unique lines mid fight in the story was neat.
[4:02:31] <misterurbanthelegend> What a great story, Why can't I remember it?
[4:02:33] <radar410> GG lore is god tier
[4:02:34] <jorniev> akuma is canon in tekken 7
[4:02:35] <Terrarp> Persona got super real
[4:02:41] <velgaduere> Subspace is the DOPEST
[4:02:42] <+StrawberryPantsu> DBFZ everyone shitting on yamcha
[4:02:45] <AlienHunterCyclone> for SFV I mean
[4:02:46] <prime_name> SUBSPACE IS THE BEST
[4:02:50] <@Menitta> Subspace is so good
[4:02:50] <+au_d3n> wooliePOYO
[4:02:53] <+wydamn> subspace is so stupid but amazing at the same time
[4:02:58] <DatAsuna> sure beats world of light
[4:03:01] <+RealThiele> maaan the breaking down someones mind palace concept is oof
[4:03:04] <+wydamn> Kirby is like the reverse Kotal Khan
[4:03:05] <Terrarp> Ultimax got some cool shit with Sho
[4:03:05] <+au_d3n> woolieMINHMAX
[4:03:07] <%Prevot> the subspace cutscenes are awesome but playing is not great
[4:03:07] <DatAsuna> or whatever the smash ultimate one is called
[4:03:08] <Esparsenior> It was so sick
[4:03:08] <%Asuterisuku> Sakurai showing his own characters favouritism.
[4:03:10] <%dekkitout> Stonks are up PogChamp
[4:03:13] <@Menitta> World of Light is terrible
[4:03:13] <DaBelovedUnderdog> What do you have against Injustice?
[4:03:19] <misterurbanthelegend> your wa?
[4:03:23] <+KillMeImHere> no more raiden lol
[4:03:30] <%TheEpicTree> Oh my god Kotal
[4:03:30] <@Menitta> Takeda was the coolest
[4:03:32] <%Javaa01> Yeah most of the combat kids just vanished into the background
[4:03:32] <+jiggy_snipe> Kotal has to die cuz Shao Khan hates him
[4:03:33] <BlackermanZX> Taquito got shafted
[4:03:33] <%LordSDB> Garra of the funk!!! woolieCHAN
[4:03:34] <%paladinstarbuster> FOR NO REASON
[4:03:37] <UltimateDomon> Gaara of the funk!
[4:03:37] <%Asuterisuku> Takeda was so sick though.
[4:03:41] <bhaysic> They had that spider lady kill Mileena too so I dont buy it
[4:03:41] <+StrawberryPantsu> Big F for Takada
[4:03:49] <%dekkitout> No Master Blaster
[4:03:53] <+jiggy_snipe> also Mileena is dead lol
[4:03:56] <bhaysic> The kombat kids were awful and should have got rid of them all
[4:03:58] <RunoEddie> they brought back some of the weirdos
[4:03:59] <Agent_Sampson> Fera Tor got REKT lol
[4:04:00] <derap41> Still upset
[4:04:01] <T_Sasquatch> Kung jin was a mistake LUL
[4:04:06] <andre11dr> Takeda got shafted, which sucks because he was the best of the kids
[4:04:09] <%Josef_Stryker> Aztec characters are made to be jobbed it seems
[4:04:11] <+wydamn> yo, did they ever confirm Rain, Mileena, and Rambo yet or is that still just a rumor?
[4:04:15] <dots4eyes> We back on Kotal again
[4:04:20] <T_Sasquatch> Atleast takeda gets a mention
[4:04:20] <%Irridium> bring Kotal forward to job eternally
[4:04:23] <%Josef_Stryker> Don't forget Necalli
[4:04:24] <RunoEddie> wrong
[4:04:25] <%TheEpicTree> Kotal get so messed up in MK11
[4:04:31] <RunoEddie> Fujin was the second boss
[4:04:33] <Aji__> I just think they wanted to give Shao Kahn some creedance and not turn him into a meme

[4:09:15] <DatAsuna> I thought judgment was the beat em up
[4:09:18] <DatAsuna> yeah
[4:09:24] <%Asuterisuku> Isuka was the beat-em-up, I think
[4:09:46] <PanicSwytch> isuka was a 4 player right?
[4:10:34] <DatAsuna> shout outs to GBA revenge of the sith, legit good 2d beat em up. weirdly good movie game
[4:10:56] <DatAsuna> He's only 5th dimensional
[4:11:13] <+linSP> Save those Dino‚Äôs!
[4:11:15] <%Javaa01> Nudge and poke at the giant hourglass
[4:11:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat intensifies
[4:11:30] <%dekkitout> If you can yeet a dino, then you better save Abe Lincoln with time powers
[4:11:41] <andre11dr> NO YOU DON'T
[4:11:46] <Ids560> but jax ends racism
[4:11:57] <andre11dr> Just make it your way
[4:12:05] <prime_name> Yeah, fix Injustice. The netplay in that game is garbo
[4:12:06] <andre11dr> The right way
[4:12:12] <DatAsuna> I would be a relatively haphazard god cause I can just wipe out the universe and redo it later
[4:12:12] <RunoEddie> but you can just go back and kill the butterfly tho
[4:12:16] <%Javaa01> Just poke the hourglass enough to make sure Overdrift 3 happens
[4:12:24] <T_Sasquatch> Injustice like slavery ?
[4:12:30] <andre11dr> Man ,im kinda channeling Pat here LUL
[4:12:31] <%Prevot> just create the same world but all fighting games have rollback
[4:12:33] <%Asuterisuku> Step 1: Kill hitler
[4:12:34] <yusefHD> Jax ending is hype
[4:12:35] <T_Sasquatch> Because that's a massivs butterfly effect
[4:12:40] <SjoeB89> Just give everyone superman powers.
[4:13:07] <SjoeB89> Then everyone is equal
[4:13:10] <%Seancicle> Jay Z went to space
[4:13:26] <DatAsuna> vehicles would likely only be for extreme speed/distance or capacity in that case. not so much individual/short trips
[4:13:38] <RunoEddie> go back in time to see if Jesus was really all that
[4:13:47] <catchiestduke> What mic you using Woolie?
[4:13:48] <+wydamn> So they announced an XCOM-style Transformers game
[4:13:55] <SjoeB89> How about like those aliens from Slaughter House 5? They could see all time at the same time
[4:14:11] <UltimateDomon> The Riddick games are the best part of the whole franchise
[4:14:24] <prime_name> Smash reveal tomorrow!
[4:14:27] <DatAsuna> Yeah tha scond movie is errr
[4:14:34] <RunoEddie> oh shit COTA!
[4:14:38] <DatAsuna> Riddick being an expanded universe is weird
[4:14:39] <SjoeB89> Children of the Atom
[4:14:42] <BurningSaph> Aw man COTA
[4:14:43] <andre11dr> Children of The Atom boyz
[4:14:44] <DatAsuna> but the games are fun
[4:14:44] <RunoEddie> X-Men hype!

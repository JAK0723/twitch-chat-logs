[0:00:06] <+supaXmugen> @Dhurkst by detail you "non answer PR Spin"?
[0:00:11] <+supaXmugen> *mean

[0:00:24] <%FuqBoiSlim> okay see yall next stream then
[0:00:31] <+CMash2k> i saw that zoi model cygames, whens that gonna happen
[0:00:39] <+ozmodek> RIP
[0:00:45] <Dragon_Batman> Cygames wanted to make real fledge games and used the mobile game as start up, which is why there is this and the action rpg coming
[0:00:47] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @JayEarly
[0:00:52] <Nina96> is Woolie gonna participate in evo this year?
[0:01:02] <+kapcommunist> play some more ads! lets get this man paid!!
[0:01:02] <exalt4747> I'd like to see some of the eternals.
[0:01:06] <matheuspomp> yeyeye
[0:01:06] <+bbHighvalor> wait did grandblue come out?
[0:01:06] <JayEarly> BABY BABY
[0:01:07] <ShoggothLord> What song is this?
[0:01:08] <Dhurkst> @supaXmugen I mean what I said. Long story short, they're trying to make the game more accessible & appealing to new players.
[0:01:11] <%gatorafan> I knew it, first was Teppen, but now Woolie has fully succumbed to the Gacha plague daedra1DrunkTibs_SQ
[0:01:12] <+bbHighvalor> sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye
[0:01:20] <+ozmodek> this game is legit one of the most fun FGs I've played in a long time
[0:01:20] <+supaXmugen> like i understand the "we want it to be accessible" schtick. but it alway comes as feeling hollow because you can barely play them online.
[0:01:26] <JayEarly> @shoggothlord the persona 3 battle theme
[0:01:29] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @JayEarly she's pretty short, most female characters of the draph race are shortstacks
[0:01:35] <+PatchworkSquid> @bbhighvalor nah, everyone is just getting the HK/JPN version
[0:01:38] <ShoggothLord> @jayearly Danke schon
[0:01:39] <HeavyNorse> Waiting for Belial... is gonna take so long. D:
[0:01:44] <+ozmodek> and the netcode is really solid even for delay
[0:01:47] <zayasu> cirHi
[0:01:52] <heartlesshealer> Mass Destruction is a classic for newer generation Persona fans
[0:01:55] <Fujiwara_92> SourPls
[0:01:56] <faqmachine> still delay though
[0:01:59] <+Canorius> seox is one that would be a nice addition
[0:02:00] <+ozmodek> i wish it was rollback but what can you do
[0:02:01] <Mvrdok_> @supaXmugen Accessibility doesn't mean good netcode tho LUL
[0:02:01] <+PatchworkSquid> atpCap atpCap atpCap
[0:02:02] <Nina96> is the grandblue net code good?
[0:02:05] <faqmachine> no
[0:02:10] <%FistOfMonkey> no
[0:02:12] <Nina96> damn
[0:02:14] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> define good
[0:02:15] <SeancetheBLADE> is this game available for ps4?
[0:02:16] <+ozmodek> I've had literally no problems with it
[0:02:17] <+CMash2k> sadly no
[0:02:20] <JayEarly> @kosorsomesaykosm_ wait is Charlotte or whatever the same race?
[0:02:20] <HeavyNorse> Saw Max play it online yesterday. It's not good.
[0:02:21] <exalt4747> Ya'll only want punch characters smh
[0:02:27] <Dragon_Batman> I think it's the same ole GG standard
[0:02:30] <exalt4747> No, Charlotta is a Harvin.
[0:02:34] <Gonewiththevoid> its arcsys netcode
[0:02:36] <heartlesshealer> Grandblue netcode is set to "Japan's infrastructure", which means that it will be crap for our boys =X
[0:02:43] <nbvewq> music name?
[0:02:45] <faqmachine> That's because there are a lot of people playing, wait til; everyone leaves then try it @ozmodek
[0:02:48] <Fujiwara_92> monkaS SourPls
[0:02:51] <JayEarly> @heavynorse the online or the whole game?
[0:02:52] <Dhurkst> @supaXmugen That's a problem with the entire Japanese fighting game dev scene, not just ArcSys. They literally don't understand that rollback is important.
[0:02:54] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Oh boy, Chrono Trigger
[0:02:59] <+ozmodek> @faqmachine you aint wrong
[0:02:59] <@Menitta> strive is gonna have the bad netcode isnt it
[0:03:00] <HeavyNorse> @JayEarly Online.

[0:03:14] <Mvrdok_> At least SNK is trying with Garou
[0:03:15] <Dragon_Batman> Time of world revolution?
[0:03:22] <%gatorafan> @dhurkst, I mean, Capcom understands, they are incapable of doing it right but they know.
[0:03:23] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @JayEarly Chalrlotte is a harvin, granblue's equivalent of FF14 lalafells, Aliza, Ladiva, and the soon to be added Naramaya are the draphs
[0:03:26] <@Menitta> woolieDATTEBAYO

[0:03:43] <+Quarkee> ketchup you heathen
[0:03:44] <2fa2st2> Harvins are cute hobbits, Draphs are kind of dwarves but the males are massive
[0:03:45] <Nina96> this is for fun right?
[0:03:47] <abusywizard> If KOF15 launches with rollback I’ll lose my shit
[0:03:49] <%FistOfMonkey> Mustard
[0:03:50] <Dragon_Batman> Ranch is pretty great
[0:03:51] <matheuspomp> WHEY
[0:03:52] <faqmachine> neither, eat fries by themselves
[0:03:56] <Dhurkst> @gatorafan According to Maximillian, MvCI has great netcode, but nobody played it.
[0:04:00] <@akuda_bar> of course it's for fun, where are they pulling a GranBlue pro out of, the future?
[0:04:00] <crimsonsaens> draphs are cow people

[0:04:12] <Fujiwara_92> if kof 15 launches at all I'll lose my shit

[0:10:38] <kuitlapiltsontli> I guess I speak for everybody when I say that Ilsa should be in
[0:10:39] <+CMash2k> BK is so sick
[0:10:41] <HazaTheRaider> They definitely should add one of the Angelboys
[0:10:44] <%ChoculaUltra> cuz I know the last character on the pass is supposed to be female
[0:10:49] <JayEarly> I’m surprised this got a dub
[0:10:50] <HazaTheRaider> Lucio or Dandalphon def
[0:10:55] <%ChoculaUltra> but you know, Lucio, Lucifer, or Sandy
[0:10:59] <HazaTheRaider> *Sandalphon
[0:11:01] <Mix_Master_Mao> season pass 1 is gothchad, shortstack katana girl, old man punch man, female gran and Zooey.
[0:11:02] <Gonewiththevoid> and apparently the unrevealed character for season 1 is confirmed to be female
[0:11:03] <exalt4747> There's no way Sandalphon isn't happening
[0:11:03] <+CMash2k> whens siete
[0:11:04] <yirawk> Probably Zooey taking the last slot
[0:11:06] <@Menitta> I dont know any of these Jpeg names
[0:11:06] <+mccf> chaos bringer is unlockable, just not in the game
[0:11:09] <+mccf> yet
[0:11:10] <+MugenSandan> Apparently based on RPG mode we'll be getting Zooey
[0:11:12] <Dragon_Batman> Narmaya it looks like her name is
[0:11:16] <+Boscuito> its prob zooey
[0:11:17] <abusywizard> Shoutouts to ProZD for voicing Zaseraga
[0:11:20] <faqmachine> Narmaya, Djeeta, Beezlebub, Sandalphon, Djeeta, Soriz and Zooey are all confirmed I think?
[0:11:21] <@akuda_bar> Do I look like I know what a JPEG is
[0:11:22] <kuitlapiltsontli> Lucio > Sandalphon. I hope he gets in.
[0:11:23] <Mix_Master_Mao> It'll be fucking zooey there's no other female character as important as her to put in.
[0:11:27] <+Canorius> yeah sandal is more likely than lucifer
[0:11:28] <Enderou> KNOCK KNOCK IT'S WOOLIE
[0:11:33] <%ChoculaUltra> wouldn't mind some Eternals too, Seox or Tweyen would be sick.
[0:11:37] <ShawnEXE> !uptime
[0:11:39] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 22 minutes and 7 seconds
[0:11:39] <Mix_Master_Mao> sandalphon is not confirmed at all but I'd bet he's in. Belial ias the first s2 character.
[0:11:46] <jorniev> what is the top pick for a dlc character for those who play granblue?
[0:11:49] <faqmachine> Ah, ok
[0:11:50] <+Boscuito> or Sarasa for big dumb energy
[0:11:51] <+Dr_DangerPhD> so far it looks like Ferry/Metera matches are basically "learn to spotdodge or gg"
[0:11:51] <@Menitta> Do I lOoK LiKe i kNoW wHaT a JpEg iS
[0:11:55] <HeavyNorse> SungWon voicing Vas is just awesome! He's such a good VA. ^^
[0:12:02] <Mix_Master_Mao> top pick as in who will get in, or top pic as in who gets in?

[0:23:29] <%ParmChampion> yea
[0:23:30] <AlteisenReiseZ> Mmhm
[0:23:31] <%xpakeo> The deep lore is gran players eat their boogers
[0:23:32] <+CMash2k> ye
[0:23:33] <HazaTheRaider> Ladiva is a girl
[0:23:33] <Nina96> a lot of people are gonna be secondary fans
[0:23:35] <faqmachine> Yes, Ladiva's a girl
[0:23:37] <SvenHolgersson> @StaceMcGate And she is beautiful
[0:23:38] <arkv01> is this the JP demo or did they ge the full JP version?
[0:23:38] <%ParmChampion> fantasy race so she’s big and bearded
[0:23:39] <+HakureiIllusion> Ladiva is best girl
[0:23:40] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Real talk, Granblue Fantasy is basically a mobile version of FF14
[0:23:40] <%Irridium> I'M SECONDARY AS FUCK
[0:23:41] <%ParmChampion> love ladiva
[0:23:44] <+ReiDuran> Ladvia is a WOMAN
[0:23:44] <SomersaultJustice> if you bought the taiwan version it would be in english
[0:23:45] <primaryfire> oh the japanese version 4Head
[0:23:46] <Nina96> myself included
[0:23:48] <%FistOfMonkey> have you heard about our lord and savior Ladiva?
[0:23:48] <+ReiDuran> max woman
[0:23:49] <2fa2st2> Ladiva is such a surprisingly well written character
[0:23:49] <%Solidnick18> I feel that
[0:23:50] <SvenHolgersson> FAKE FAN
[0:23:50] <arkv01> Ladiva is DEFINITELY A WOMAN
[0:23:51] <+CMash2k> oh god they didnt get the HK version
[0:23:51] <+Linearlinera> im secondary af
[0:23:51] <Fujiwara_92> IMA TERTIARY
[0:23:52] <abusywizard> @stacemcgate yeah she/her pronouns
[0:23:54] <%ParmChampion> ladiva is the STRONGEST
[0:23:56] <+TeethMuncher> better than a tertiary
[0:23:56] <@Menitta> Being secondary to Granblue is more economically viable
[0:23:56] <%Irridium> I wonder which one is Versus
[0:24:01] <AlteisenReiseZ> Draphs come in 2 flavors, Big and Beefy, or Short and Stacked
[0:24:02] <sjcodan> Ladiva is the true ideal
[0:24:03] <+Canorius> so why no hk version
[0:24:03] <%foreverN2dust> @Binary_Fireball however, Rage of Bahamut had a decent first season
[0:24:05] <HazaTheRaider> YOO DJEETA
[0:24:05] <gustavozxd> being a main fan means you play the gatcha game so how about no
[0:24:06] <BestTeaMaker> did woolie buy the right version
[0:24:08] <HazaTheRaider> ;_;
[0:24:08] <+eanscrale> Can't you just enjoy the thing
[0:24:08] <HeavyNorse> BTW, you can turn English on for text and voices.
[0:24:09] <%Irridium> you went to profile LUL
[0:24:10] <%Prevot> Persona fans are secondaries
[0:24:12] <OBS_VinnieK> ahh sucks he had to get the JP version and not the HK version
[0:24:12] <DatAsuna> hardcore woolie fans are the worst
[0:24:15] <arkv01> FUCK OFF GRANNnn
[0:24:15] <@akuda_bar> because he's dumb, it's fine
[0:24:15] <%Solidnick18> oh god
[0:24:17] <+kapcommunist> quarternary boys PogChamp
[0:24:17] <StaceMcGate> Where do you got for lore? All the sites are in japanese
[0:24:19] <faqmachine> @HeavyNorse that's HK version only
[0:24:20] <awalr> it's almost like they're fanatical or something
[0:24:21] <%ParmChampion> everyone wants to be ladiva... no matter who
[0:24:23] <Dhurkst> @WoolieVersus The Hong Kong version has English
[0:24:23] <StaceMcGate> go*
[0:24:23] <NicholasKane> can reggie read katakana?
[0:24:24] <$megamonmon123> dont be a secondary lover reggie
[0:24:26] <goose_attack_almanac> fun fact: All fights with Lowain are the brothers making up how the fight would go.
[0:24:26] <Gonewiththevoid> secobdaries are fine. cygames WANTS to have people play their console games and get to know granblue that way
[0:24:27] <+Mr_Quail> Discover tech for me before the game comes out
[0:24:28] <+contramann> Why no HK version?
[0:24:30] <stranger59> I liked Woolie before he was cool...
[0:24:31] <zenith0111> Nah Secondaries requires a shit opinion about the franchise/show/medium
[0:24:37] <mobius_won> Singapore version also has English
[0:24:39] <BestTeaMaker> why didn't woolie just get the HK version
[0:24:43] <arkv01> cause lowain is nowhere near strong enough to actually be in this game LUL
[0:24:43] <Evendrag> wait, cant u set it to english?
[0:24:46] <kuitlapiltsontli> You should have gotten the asian version with english
[0:24:47] <%FuqBoiSlim> >SECONDARIES DansGame
[0:24:47] <DesDavis> HK cards were sold out last I heard
[0:24:51] <GMKGoat> Woolie requires JP version for maximum weeb
[0:24:51] <crimsonsaens> Moonrune version
[0:24:52] <%ParmChampion> jp version is the only one without english isnt it
[0:24:52] <@Menitta> I refuse to install a Japanese pyramid scheme gacha
[0:24:54] <OBS_VinnieK> yeah HK version has full english translation and dub
[0:24:54] <faqmachine> @Evendrag That's only in the HK version
[0:24:56] <+CMash2k> woolie done gone n goofed it up
[0:24:57] <KSDM> Touhou's got the worst secondaries.
[0:25:01] <+contramann> @DesDavis I bought an HK card last night
[0:25:02] <DaBigVitus> how could they not know there is an english version?
[0:25:02] <+HakureiIllusion> Why put Djeeta there when she isn't even in the game
[0:25:03] <Enderou> can't you set this to english?
[0:25:04] <Dhurkst> Woolie's playing hard mode. XD

[0:26:32] <+Canorius> imagine not wasting years of your life in gbf
[0:26:33] <+CMash2k> its real painful going from my tv with all that good english and then seeing this
[0:26:43] <%xpakeo> HK ps cards got the price inflated to like 100+ dollars because of high demand, thats most likely why they arent playing it
[0:26:48] <+Juannieee> @Canorius couldn't be me
[0:26:50] <%ParmChampion> damn
[0:26:51] <+Juannieee> Kappa
[0:26:51] <zenith0111> Shortcut version can be the better option depending on the scenario

[0:28:11] <BluBox> GATCHA
[0:28:13] <Dhurkst> @WoolieVersus Check out Percival. He's loosely similar to Vergil in looks & personality, and his moveset is kinda like a composite of Sol & Ky.

[0:29:57] <%ParmChampion> LADIVA OR BUST
[0:29:57] <@Menitta> BELIEVE IN VICTORY
[0:29:58] <OkamiDude15> There is an ilsa and Beatrix skin for zeta
[0:29:59] <+Canorius> there is a Ilsa skin and its great
[0:30:02] <+CMash2k> using the shortcut for ladivas 360 gives you less damage btw
[0:30:02] <DontChuckle98> Wow. There’s a lot of the color blue in Granblue, isn’t there? :)
[0:30:05] <Andrei11Droasca> You,wassup everyone!
[0:30:11] <Dragon_Batman> Woolie P1, Reggie P2? just came back
[0:30:17] <Fujiwara_92> let Reggie learn wools LUL
[0:30:17] <+CMash2k> yep
[0:30:18] <@Menitta> this looks tight
[0:30:27] <Mix_Master_Mao> @DontChuckle98 you joke but the MC gets super saiyan blue as the hardest thing to grind for in the game
[0:30:31] <%ParmChampion> SWORD CLINKING SOUNDS woolieSHOOK woolieSHOOK woolieSHOOK
[0:30:31] <+TeethMuncher> @StaceMcGate pretty sure zeta has one
[0:30:34] <crimsonsaens> MC is Gran and this is his blue fantasy
[0:30:36] <+kapcommunist> what they find in princess diana's glove box? head and shoulders...
[0:30:38] <Reizie_Etherealm> Reggie is releasing his inner weeb LUL
[0:30:38] <Mix_Master_Mao> and they're releasing super saiyan blue palette swaps as paid dlc
[0:30:43] <@Menitta> Ganbatte
[0:30:43] <Retolee> woolie not sharing how to do super
[0:30:44] <+Canorius> lancey was one of the first ssrs pulled in my game its kinda nostalgic
[0:30:44] <+UrielCobalt> @Taglog7 Not long now, like most Playstation stuff going forward..
[0:30:54] <zenith0111> REGGIE IS RELEASING THE LIMITERS
[0:30:55] <%Irridium> @Mix_Master_Mao are you telling me Gran gets Blue?
[0:31:03] <Mix_Master_Mao> he becomes Danchou Azur yes
[0:31:05] <Twon_From_Wakanda> do it cohhWut

[0:31:21] <StaceMcGate> ...Baiken better be in the new GG
[0:31:22] <+shaidot> what's unique about this anime fighter compared to the other ones?
[0:31:23] <%ParmChampion> jin?
[0:31:29] <crimsonsaens> @Mix_Master_Mao That's paid dlc? I've seen people choosing that palette for other characters
[0:31:29] <+Linearlinera> anti air jabs?
[0:31:30] <+Canorius> gatcha
[0:31:31] <%ChoculaUltra> dumb question, but is the online cross region? Might just pick up the HK copy and say fuck the wait lol
[0:31:31] <+Linearlinera> pog
[0:31:36] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @Mix_Master_Mao
[0:31:41] <+UrielCobalt> HE uses the same element but his moves are compoletely different
[0:31:41] <+HakureiIllusion> All parts of the game's name have something to do with the characters or the game itself. Gran = Gran, Blue = Lyria, Fantasy = getting anything good out of the gacha.
[0:31:42] <faqmachine> @ChoculaUltra yes
[0:31:43] <Fiendmaw> This anime fighter is street fighter
[0:31:43] <Stalinismyspiritanimal> BIG ANIME TIME
[0:31:44] <%Irridium> @ChoculaUltra yep
[0:31:45] <zenith0111> @stacemcgate I thought she was already confirmed?
[0:31:46] <Mix_Master_Mao> wait i can't post links fuck
[0:31:47] <HazaTheRaider> noo you cut away from the smile ;_;
[0:31:48] <%AlteisenReiseZ> AlteisenReiseZ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! yeyeye
[0:31:50] <jase__x> Woolie out here learning character before reggie get to learn
[0:31:51] <%yeknomlive> reggie needs to know about 66 a/b/c and 2 a/b/c
[0:31:51] <%ChoculaUltra> oooooooooh man
[0:31:53] <+Mr_Initials> Play lowain you cowards
[0:31:54] <%ParmChampion> @shaidot gacha money and specials like the shotos and terry in smash
[0:31:54] <Andrei11Droasca> Hei look is most beautiful game ever.....with a netcode inferior to Fight of Animals
[0:32:00] <OkamiDude15> @choculaultra you can choose which region you play with as a setting online
[0:32:07] <Mix_Master_Mao> search Gran on granblue fantasy wiki, scroll down you'll see the super saiyan god super saiyan gran.
[0:32:09] <%ChoculaUltra> oh that's even more excellent
[0:32:13] <%RioGascar> RioGascar subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! Love the branching out on content. Any tips on getting into anime fighters? A big issue me and friends have is we just dont like any of the characters. a lot of em are just too weird to connect to.
[0:32:16] <%Irridium> lowain's got some BULL SHIT I tell you what. It's the best when you play him and infuriating when you fight him LUL
[0:32:16] <+CMash2k> yo forget lancelot wheres the ladiva love
[0:32:17] <Dragon_Batman> Lowain's super seems pretty dam strong
[0:32:20] <+Canorius> hey gbf during anniversary and new years is pretty merciful with its gatcha
[0:32:20] <+UrielCobalt> Thanks for the LuvBrownL @riogascar
[0:32:20] <+ShionLalune> woolieversus : Stream ID We need backup! Lvl 200 Wooliewoolz &Reggie
[0:32:25] <+slimstanky> this game is so purdy
[0:32:33] <Mix_Master_Mao> lowain is apparently fraudulent as long as you can spot dodge the super
[0:32:33] <%ParmChampion> THE PEOPLE WANT LADIVAAA
[0:32:39] <neVan0> LUL
[0:32:40] <+CMash2k> @shionlalune why would you pub a 6man
[0:32:41] <+Squishy3> that'll be a -2, shion
[0:32:44] <OkamiDude15> Ssj blue gran is 21 and you can’t tell me otherwise
[0:32:44] <SvenHolgersson> "I'm downloading"- Reggie 2020
[0:32:47] <jorniev> netcode of this game is bad?
[0:32:47] <+shaidot> So this game has overall better production quality?
[0:32:51] <%Solidnick18> good download
[0:32:51] <%ParmChampion> he doesnt even have the skybound does he
[0:32:55] <+TeethMuncher> evoDownload
[0:32:56] <%ParmChampion> that’s what i heard at least
[0:32:59] <StaceMcGate> @zenith0111 she has not, she was a hidden char in OG and the cast is so far the OG cast, but haven't confirmed
[0:33:04] <absolute_cagemony> oh hey they're playing anime again
[0:33:06] <exalt4747> I cant's stand how often the dragon knights get pushed .
[0:33:08] <+Taglog7> Nobody likes king cuck
[0:33:09] <+Mr_Initials> lan-chan is all move
[0:33:09] <%yeknomlive> delay based net code so as bad as the other arcsys games
[0:33:10] <+ReiDuran> Netcode of the game is just Arksys netcode, which is shitty delay based
[0:33:11] <+MisterVantes> He does combo
[0:33:13] <TopLeftCenter> There's more to it than just dodging Lowain's super, he's not broken but its not something you can just get around either
[0:33:25] <absolute_cagemony> Does this one involve cameras and underwear too?
[0:33:29] <%ChoculaUltra> also - do the digital copies of the game come with those sweet sweet item codes? I need some Damascus lmao
[0:33:34] <%Irridium> it works when you're fighting someone close to you. on wired.
[0:33:34] <+UrielCobalt> Seung Mina's cousin from another dimension is pretty good
[0:33:35] <Andrei11Droasca> @jorniev Sadly, yes!
[0:33:36] <Mix_Master_Mao> >dama bar
[0:33:37] <zayasu> pick metera TehePelo
[0:33:38] <StaceMcGate> I don't like the text placement, kinda distracting
[0:33:38] <%ParmChampion> only for ladiva...
[0:33:40] <crimsonsaens> Don't forget autocombos scale super hard
[0:33:41] <Mix_Master_Mao> bro....
[0:33:41] <faqmachine> @WoolieVersus Reggie, that stance has a guard point
[0:33:42] <%Irridium> anything else is a crapshoot though
[0:33:45] <Nekros4442> it's a counter stance
[0:33:46] <HazaTheRaider> his smile...
[0:33:47] <+TeethMuncher> Does reggie know about the full screen fireball?
[0:33:48] <Mix_Master_Mao> @ChoculaUltra pick up the evolite instead.
[0:33:50] <Dragon_Batman> That's also a counter right?
[0:33:50] <yirawk> Yeah codes come with digital
[0:33:51] <Ultimatefool> :D
[0:33:54] <+shaidot> The game looks good but the artstyle in P4 arena ultimax is much more appealing to me. This artstyle feels very generic... Would hva eprefered a Fate G/O fighting game if they were gonna go for a gacha adaption
[0:33:55] <blackkanye> Eventually I should sell/trade these codes
[0:33:59] <zenith0111> I remember when I first played Xrd EVERYONE was saying the netcode was good to fine but then this talk of Rollback makes it feel like a fever dream NotLikeThis
[0:34:04] <Dragon_Batman> Guard point that is what that would beeee
[0:34:05] <%yeknomlive> there's a follow up to that move
[0:34:06] <OldManDeckardCain> you can unlock "lewder" costume for metera and zeta if you clear rpg mode LUL
[0:34:07] <%ChoculaUltra> @Mix_Master_Mao oh snap, I didn't even know evolite was one of the items you can pick
[0:34:12] <Mix_Master_Mao> people out here shitting on mane man minaba.
[0:34:21] <OkamiDude15> The stance has armor for a hit. EX blocks both high and low
[0:34:25] <Mix_Master_Mao> yeah it's evolite, gold bar, something else and something else but who gives a fuck we all want the evolite
[0:34:26] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:34:30] <SomersaultJustice> so it's like Leo?
[0:34:30] <crimsonsaens> How lewd are we talking about?
[0:34:31] <%yeknomlive> it's armor
[0:34:31] <blackkanye> It is their uncensored outfit
[0:34:31] <absolute_cagemony> man... why do the sprites and background look so good?
[0:34:40] <OkamiDude15> Cygames
[0:34:44] <%ParmChampion> every time they end i get cucked out of the possible ladiva switch😔😔
[0:34:45] <+Taglog7> Longer cool down for easier inputs
[0:34:46] <+President_Miyazaki> So did Woolie get the wrong version or is there a setting he hasn't changed to make subtitles english?
[0:34:49] <+tearknack> @shaidot or the could adopt fate/zero or even stay/knight, and leave out the gacha garbage, just a thought. wouldn't get as much money suppose
[0:34:51] <+saladin1911> @oldmandeckardcain You may have just sold me on this game...
[0:34:52] <@akuda_bar> this anime shading... i can't get over it
[0:34:53] <Mix_Master_Mao> Granblue Fantasy is not even 1/5th Coomer levels of FGO.
[0:34:55] <+Canorius> gbf og has good backgrounds too
[0:34:56] <+ChrisAlgoo> look at these kof rolls
[0:34:56] <zenith0111> Ew Leo DansGame
[0:34:56] <OkamiDude15> And arcsys is why
[0:34:57] <%RioGascar> They look good but...man they look generic
[0:34:59] <faqmachine> @WoolieVersus Reggie, you can do any follow-up from any stance
[0:35:01] <faqmachine> iirc
[0:35:04] <+ChrisAlgoo> also they're 3d models
[0:35:09] <+kapcommunist> is this rendered in 3D like DBFZ?
[0:35:09] <damienlunas> Anyone else super not into Granblu's designs?
[0:35:12] <%ChoculaUltra> oh fuck, so you can get 1 evolite per copy? Arcana Evokers just like that?!
[0:35:13] <+TeethMuncher> @President_Miyazaki HK version's price is inflated
[0:35:13] <crimsonsaens> I heard some characters can cancel specials with the roll too
[0:35:15] <StaceMcGate> @President_Miyazaki NA version isn't out yet, there is an english Hong Kong version but they are just waiting for NA release
[0:35:16] <%ParmChampion> @president_miyazaki wrong ver but also the english one is really expensive now ig
[0:35:18] <SomersaultJustice> No
[0:35:18] <nothuzad> yes kapcommunist
[0:35:19] <%AtomicVR> The generic feel is what really bugs me about GB. It's got so many characters that are just 'sexy knight'
[0:35:20] <%RioGascar> All im getting reminded of is looking at ant mobile apps ads on youtube
[0:35:20] <zenith0111> @damienlunas I second that
[0:35:21] <Dragon_Batman> Coomer LUL
[0:35:31] <Nekros4442> @RioGascar Welcome to Humans in fantasy. There are also other races in the game
[0:35:33] <Mix_Master_Mao> guess why it has sexy knight characters, fujo's eat that shit uip.
[0:35:37] <absolute_cagemony> SHUT UP SEXY KNIGHT IS HOT
[0:35:39] <+shaidot> Fate S/N doesn't have as many characters and most of the characters that are in Fate S/N don't have great character designs.
[0:35:41] <EndgameContent> Fuck it up, Reggie!
[0:35:44] <Ultimatefool> Oh shit Reggie POTENTIAL UNLOCKED
[0:35:46] <+TeethMuncher> Needs more danger time...
[0:35:49] <OldManDeckardCain> even the eng dub is done, xseed and marvelous are just bad LUL
[0:35:53] <Fujiwara_92> GIT EM REGGIE
[0:35:54] <%ParmChampion> open the gates reggie
[0:35:55] <Dragon_Batman> Surprised he hasn't found her projectile
[0:35:56] <zenith0111> She's a butterface ResidentSleeper
[0:35:56] <%RioGascar> I’ve seen humans in fantasy. sure they are generic
[0:35:57] <Mix_Master_Mao> granblue has a wide variety of boys and girls.
[0:35:58] <%Solidnick18> ez
[0:35:58] <Enderou> holy fuck that clash is so intense
[0:35:59] <HazaTheRaider> the Reggiegan has opened..
[0:36:02] <SvenHolgersson> TIMESCAM REGGIE
[0:36:03] <%RioGascar> but the art style matters
[0:36:03] <Idon__> Lancelot has arthritis, lol
[0:36:03] <%ChoculaUltra> there's always Draph, Harvin, Erune, [Unknown], Primals which are basically sexy angels, etc.
[0:36:03] <Nekros4442> Zeta's charge is like Hulk's You can go twice in the same direction
[0:36:06] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Don't forget the sexy angels
[0:36:07] <Andrei11Droasca> So ,dose the giant edge lord guy suck ,cause he seems really slow with no range ?
[0:36:08] <+tearknack> @shaidot i don't particularly like many of the designs in f/go, so eh
[0:36:09] <+Canorius> humans in granblue are just ‘sexy knight’ and its great
[0:36:13] <StaceMcGate> Does this game have a lab?
[0:36:20] <OkamiDude15> It does have a lab
[0:36:20] <+CMash2k> if you use zetas ex charge you can go 3 times
[0:36:23] <JayEarly> Lancelot makes me feel things
[0:36:30] <Mix_Master_Mao> secondaries the lot of you
[0:36:31] <+CMash2k> can even combo into super
[0:36:32] <Idon__> why the fuck chat talking about FGO, wait till the Unlimited Code stream lol
[0:36:33] <absolute_cagemony> I'd bang a girl in fullknight armor. I mean her, not me
[0:36:36] <RedDragonMoth> jp version interesting
[0:36:37] <crimsonsaens> It also has match-up training like GG
[0:36:38] <%ParmChampion> vaseraga looks strong and he’s cool so he gets my vote even if he sucks
[0:36:49] <Mix_Master_Mao> vaseraga is a cyborg b tw
[0:36:50] <Huntercd> Which one is reggie?
[0:36:55] <Mix_Master_Mao> left]
[0:36:57] <OkamiDude15> You are correct that he is kinda low tier
[0:36:58] <%ParmChampion> ladiva is the backup muscle pick doe
[0:37:01] <%ParmChampion> cyborg?!
[0:37:02] <%Solidnick18> Reggie is zeta
[0:37:03] <absolute_cagemony> Reggie is the guy, Woolie is the girl
[0:37:03] <iamthegreatest514> Woolie and Reggie on Granblue hypee
[0:37:10] <%ParmChampion> what parts of him are robot
[0:37:11] <zenith0111> A LOT of things are safe in this game
[0:37:13] <%Irridium> Ladiva's safe on so much it fuckes me up every time
[0:37:15] <SomersaultJustice> look at not ky over here
[0:37:15] <umm_idunno> does the block button negate crossups?
[0:37:15] <Shishi1205> woolie is the bishie
[0:37:19] <2fa2st2> i'd rather have sexy knights than fat Caesar thanks
[0:37:19] <Mix_Master_Mao> vaseraga has automagod parts integrated into his body as part of a treatment to make hims stronker.
[0:37:19] <+shaidot> Wait is Woolie streaming Unlimited Code?
[0:37:20] <OkamiDude15> Vase raga is cool chill guy despite how he may appear
[0:37:21] <+tearknack> i don't mind fullknight armour i just don't like the overdesigned fantasy knight armour with a thousand different gilded pieces
[0:37:23] <Reizie_Etherealm> Part of the reason why I don't like medieval fantasy setting is because there's only so much you can do with the aesthetic, we've already seen everything that can be done
[0:37:24] <%ChoculaUltra> oh dope, is this like an Erste Kingdom war stage?
[0:37:26] <ElementalX1000> Woolie is winning
[0:37:26] <%ParmChampion> damn
[0:37:28] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Vaseraga is half man-half machine god
[0:37:31] <%RioGascar> That announcers is really dull
[0:37:32] <crimsonsaens> There are like 3 Ky's in this game
[0:37:33] <zenith0111> Zoomers saying this game is faster than SFV smh atpRtsd
[0:37:35] <Mix_Master_Mao> it's not that visible but he's intended to have even more endurance and strength than is typical for his race.
[0:37:36] <%AtomicVR> Depending on how good the single player RPG mode is I still have an interest in this but that netcode tho
[0:37:37] <%Solidnick18> rip reggie
[0:37:40] <+tearknack> @shaidot i think it was a joke lol
[0:37:44] <Fujiwara_92> damn Reggie
[0:37:44] <+Boscuito> looks like an enforcers battle stage
[0:37:45] <+President_Miyazaki> I hope we get to see some Ladiva gameplay, she's big and strong.
[0:37:46] <+richuyo> REGGIE TRY A SUPER
[0:37:47] <HazaTheRaider> COMBO: DID
[0:37:47] <%ChoculaUltra> there's also robots in Granblue. Like a crazy amount of robots and future tech, actually lol.
[0:37:48] <%RioGascar> i dont feel any energy from that announcer at all
[0:37:51] <StaceMcGate> I'm honestly surprised a Gatcha game would release a fighter, I thought the points of Gatcha was maximing profit with lowest production costs
[0:37:52] <+TeethMuncher> #1 stunna
[0:37:54] <Andrei11Droasca> Wait ,a minute, why is he playing the Japanese version wen the HK version has full english ?
[0:37:57] <Retolee> reggie needs his supers
[0:38:02] <+kapcommunist> hot boi szn ok
[0:38:03] <%AlteisenReiseZ> THERE'S A KAMEN RIDER IN GRANBLUE
[0:38:03] <+Canorius> yea zeta and vaseraga have basically soul bonds with their weapons
[0:38:06] <SvenHolgersson> He teleport
[0:38:07] <+tearknack> @Andrei11Droasca price gouging, likely
[0:38:09] <Mix_Master_Mao> the aliens are from the moon and they are hot pale dudes and girls. They have a half of God and want the other half.
[0:38:09] <+shaidot> We will pull Woolie into the Fate hole eventually... Just need one good fighting game
[0:38:09] <transporterthesequel> Wwwoooolllieeee, change those subs to english!
[0:38:09] <snowmanie> mow that's a husbando win pose
[0:38:10] <%FuqBoiSlim> FUJOBAIT KNIGHT DansGame DansGame DansGame
[0:38:10] <Ultimatefool> @Reizie_Etherealm If you're talking about this, it's not really medieval. More steampunk with magic elements
[0:38:11] <faqmachine> @StaceMcGate Cygames sponsors fighting game players
[0:38:14] <%ParmChampion> who’s the kamen rider?!
[0:38:16] <2fa2st2> @choculaultra I think it's Amalthea
[0:38:20] <+Taglog7> I gotta have my cross-ups
[0:38:25] <JayEarly> @2fa2st2 as a fan of Roman history fat Caesar pisses me off, Caesar should be a hot dad dammit
[0:38:25] <+Dr_DangerPhD> if you hold the block button and mash the stick back you can get free just defend meter gain
[0:38:27] <zenith0111> There is no Kamen Rider Jebaited
[0:38:28] <+CMash2k> doesnt cygames sponser daigo these days?
[0:38:30] <crimsonsaens> Cygames released Gacha games because it's cheap, they then used that money to fund more costly games
[0:38:31] <%ChoculaUltra> Nicholas is the Kamen Rider.
[0:38:31] <@akuda_bar> reggie's learnding
[0:38:32] <Mix_Master_Mao> @ParmChampion search Shiro/Nicholas on gbf wiki you'll get the kamen rider.
[0:38:33] <Dragon_Batman> I like the light blue
[0:38:33] <OkamiDude15> Cygames is made up of people who want to make actual games but those cost some big money
[0:38:36] <+TeethMuncher> back in my day we had to black from both sides, uphill, in the snow
[0:38:39] <HazaTheRaider> they jsut threw everything into GBF. there's angel magic, there's Moon techbros, there's magic schools, there's knights
[0:38:46] <rosabellamelantha> @StaceMcGate nah granblue puts in the EFFORT and money from it's marketing to it's community events, it's also one of the more forgiving gacha
[0:38:46] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @ParmChampion Look Up Nicholas/Shiro GBF
[0:38:46] <%RioGascar> that is a long ass victory quote line
[0:38:47] <@Menitta> Hi Super Nintendo Chalmers
[0:38:47] <+tearknack> @Ultimatefool when people say "medieval" they tend to mean "european knight looking fantasy stuff"
[0:38:48] <KitsuneManami> @WoolieVersus You saw the DLC i take it?
[0:38:52] <floralkami> @woolieversus isn't there English settings in the HK or Indonesian versions?
[0:38:55] <OkamiDude15> Fuck the moon give me back my boy
[0:38:58] <Mix_Master_Mao> the people who made the angels are related to the moon people, almost certainly.
[0:39:06] <Mix_Master_Mao> danchou can , will and absolutely must destroy the moon.
[0:39:09] <faqmachine> @floralkami He has the jp version
[0:39:15] <%ParmChampion> WTF SHIRO COOL
[0:39:17] <+Boscuito> i would not call the people from the moon all bros
[0:39:17] <%Solidnick18> you slick woolie
[0:39:18] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> help the moon stole my bishie what do
[0:39:19] <Huntercd> Is Woolie the handsome blue dude?
[0:39:20] <+tearknack> @floralkami yes, which is why those versions are expensive AF
[0:39:22] <%ParmChampion> GIB RIDER
[0:39:24] <+tearknack> @Huntercd yes
[0:39:24] <+CMash2k> gotta go save issac from the moon fuckers
[0:39:28] <+crashtherican> put in English you weirdos
[0:39:31] <+egalitarian696969> I think you have 12 frames to tech grabs, but late techs deal damage
[0:39:32] <%RioGascar> So since i am not getting HK or whatever version...how long till this game is out in the west
[0:39:36] <faqmachine> @crashtherican This is the jp version
[0:39:37] <zenith0111> Yeah this isn't Medival
[0:39:38] <jase__x> GET IT REGGIE
[0:39:38] <SvenHolgersson> ITS PLUS
[0:39:39] <+TeethMuncher> LUL
[0:39:40] <iosephe> rekt
[0:39:42] <+CMash2k> one month
[0:39:43] <StaceMcGate> knee slap
[0:39:44] <neVan0> LOL
[0:39:47] <crimsonsaens> West version comes out next month
[0:39:48] <%ParmChampion> @riogascar like march 3
[0:39:50] <%FuqBoiSlim> WOOOOOW
[0:39:51] <Mix_Master_Mao> if swear to god if they cuck us and wait one more year before a society event. No more kappa bs, I want another moon event.
[0:39:53] <+SirGO0SE> LUL
[0:39:54] <OkamiDude15> @crashtherican this is the Japanese copy so no English here.
[0:39:56] <blackkanye> So much is fucking safe or even that is fucking blows my mind
[0:39:58] <SvenHolgersson> BE ON YOUR TOES REGGIE
[0:39:58] <Reizie_Etherealm> @Ultimatefool This is my first impression of it so I haven't seen much yet but I'm looking forward to some guns if steampunk is a big thing in this universe
[0:40:04] <%RioGascar> Ah, well drat I’ll probably be playing half life vr
[0:40:07] <GodlyLuigi> this not legend of zelda music
[0:40:11] <Mix_Master_Mao> they have lots of gun characters they could put in and different kinds of guns.
[0:40:13] <HazaTheRaider> there's like an entire batch of people who use guns
[0:40:13] <%ChoculaUltra> Another Moon event would be dope. Moon lore in GBF is always a good time.
[0:40:14] <coreybom> @crashtherican They can't. They have the Japanese version, which doesn't have English text. Only the HK version has English translation.
[0:40:20] <%ParmChampion> hla doesn’t have ladiva...
[0:40:24] <+Boscuito> wait another year for moonstime
[0:40:25] <zenith0111> There is no steampunk in this Jebaited
[0:40:27] <+crashtherican> I have the Hk version and it has English but not the jp version?
[0:40:32] <OkamiDude15> If they put in a gun character they’ll put in someone like Silva
[0:40:33] <JayEarly> “medieval times” is like hundreds of years of history and most medieval fantasy is hardly like the history at all
[0:40:34] <StaceMcGate> ....so who is best girl in this series?
[0:40:36] <Mix_Master_Mao> My girl Ilsa uses two pistols and would probably have a bullet system, but then there is a girl named Silva who uses a sniper rifle and kick.
[0:40:39] <Retolee> DAMMIT
[0:40:40] <@Menitta> whatc
[0:40:41] <blackkanye> Hong Kong, SIngapore, asian versions in general have english
[0:40:45] <@Menitta> That's bullshit
[0:40:46] <Mix_Master_Mao> @StaceMcGate Ilsa
[0:40:46] <blackkanye> except jp
[0:40:48] <+RadRetroRider> WHENS NUNS4
[0:40:50] <floralkami> WHAT
[0:40:50] <%Solidnick18> damn woolie just get hit
[0:40:51] <%Irridium> oh it's infuriating
[0:40:54] <KitsuneManami> @WoolieVersus If you like Vergil, You're gonna like the Cowgirl Samurai
[0:40:54] <%ChoculaUltra> y'all think they're going to release a Belial as a Flash Gala unit?
[0:40:55] <+CMash2k> ilsa would be cooler than silva tbh
[0:40:55] <Reizie_Etherealm> DAMN
[0:40:56] <floralkami> WHAT THE FUCK?
[0:40:57] <SomersaultJustice> Misogi
[0:40:57] <%FuqBoiSlim> What did ArcSys mean by this???
[0:40:58] <+TeethMuncher> Reggie getting robbed, live on stream
[0:40:58] <@Menitta> Everything is safe
[0:40:59] <Huntercd> Con on Reggie
[0:40:59] <SvenHolgersson> GOTTIEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[0:41:01] <BallerSwagBro9k> Yoooooooo
[0:41:02] <Andrei11Droasca> Wow ,these guy just mashing on those supers LUL
[0:41:03] <2fa2st2> Ilsa or Esser
[0:41:05] <jase__x> DAMN
[0:41:08] <Mix_Master_Mao> don't think too hard about tech levels in Granblue. It's One Piece in the sky.
[0:41:08] <yirawk> I think most of the people interested in GBVS just bit the bullet and picked up the HK version instead of waiting for a western release
[0:41:10] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Reizie_Etherealm guns do exist as well as some steampunk stuff, not sure if they'll get one of those characters in tho...maybe ilsa or eustace
[0:41:12] <+FloorBurger> get robbed.
[0:41:13] <%kyh9> These fucking pretty swordsman fucks
[0:41:17] <+Canorius> im not sure about a belial ssr he just got a summon
[0:41:18] <floralkami> WHAT WAS THAT ROBBERY?
[0:41:18] <2fa2st2> probably not Esser 'cause Eternals
[0:41:19] <StaceMcGate> @Mix_Master_Mao Imperial army catgirl/
[0:41:23] <neVan0> belial flash would make SO much bank
[0:41:25] <blackkanye> @KitsuneManami who? because that would be sick
[0:41:30] <Mix_Master_Mao> damn ok tomoi
[0:41:30] <%RioGascar> makes me wonder how western copies for this game will sell

[0:42:12] <coreybom> @hazatheraider They can't. This isn't the translated version.
[0:42:13] <%RioGascar> Since anyone actually interested in the pro scene or doing some tournament stuff is probably gonna be ignoring the western release
[0:42:13] <%Solidnick18> wait
[0:42:14] <Mix_Master_Mao> vaseraga would never betray Zeta like that.
[0:42:15] <Andrei11Droasca> So he seems like he's slow and hes go no range...
[0:42:17] <Twon_From_Wakanda> The big dude is the weakest in the game

[0:46:24] <OkamiDude15> Love live is canon in granblue
[0:46:32] <+eanscrale> It's Gendo
[0:46:34] <Dragon_Batman> Granblue also has Jehuty no?
[0:46:34] <gunsrlove> It's just a chaos warrior
[0:46:35] <%AlteisenReiseZ> He's Akainu from One Piece
[0:46:37] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> as is persona 5
[0:46:39] <HazaTheRaider> love live AND idolmaster is canon to GBF
[0:46:42] <OkamiDude15> @ninjagentleman they can’t because this is the Japanese version which has no English
[0:46:43] <damienlunas> Oh man I was so disappointed when I learned that Green is not Vasaraga's default color just now.
[0:46:45] <+tearknack> @NinjaGentleman they can't, jp doesn't have english translations
[0:46:47] <kuitlapiltsontli> sosuke bosuke wins
[0:46:53] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Is Idolmaster canon in Berserk?

[0:47:19] <blackkanye> THEY HAVE JP VERSION. The game is out in hong kong (the version I have), singapore, and indonesia. I also have heard maybe malaysia?
[0:47:21] <zenith0111> Green Knight is a specific folklore. So you got to reserve the Green Knight
[0:47:22] <%Solidnick18> booo
[0:47:28] <Dragon_Batman> That means Persona 5 and Zone of the Enders have a link
[0:47:29] <Mix_Master_Mao> No God works different in Granblue Fantasy.
[0:47:35] <%yeknomlive> chip damage is damage taken while blocking
[0:47:35] <MoonlightP> god is a big dragon
[0:47:48] <Mix_Master_Mao> HE was a big dragon, now he's two different big dragons but also the same.
[0:47:53] <matheuspomp> bahamuto
[0:47:53] <%ChoculaUltra> there's a crap ton of Christian/Catholic motif in a lot of the game's upper tier characters, but nothing super overt
[0:47:54] <Dragon_Batman> There is a Taiwanese version too, that Max was playing
[0:47:56] <+tearknack> sounds like dnd
[0:47:57] <2fa2st2> love live etc all end with "just a dream" though, SnK is actually taking place somewhere somehow
[0:47:58] <JayEarly> man a Warhammer Fantasy/40K fighting game could be raw as hell
[0:48:02] <%ParmChampion> man this has decided it vaseraga is the day 1 main no matter how bad he is
[0:48:07] <HazaTheRaider> see this is what happens when you don't grind your M2 grid

[0:49:03] <Nekros4442> Charlotta also has a Demon Flip you werent using Reggie
[0:49:03] <%Irridium> @RioGascar the western servers are even up lol. Only one room on the New York server is full so we'll see what happens
[0:49:05] <blackkanye> Isn't char's unique a counteR?
[0:49:05] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> vaseraga's range overall can be pretty deceptive
[0:49:06] <+clausover> choke
[0:49:07] <grenadier42> throw that potato outta here
[0:49:08] <+eanscrale> Dude you have demon flip
[0:49:08] <%yeknomlive> @RioGascar if you're competitive sure

[0:49:21] <MetelStar> 🥔 🔪
[0:49:29] <MoonlightP> scythe yeet is why you play vaseraga
[0:49:31] <+kapcommunist> protect ya crown
[0:49:32] <floralkami> yes, fuck the potato kappa
[0:49:33] <damienlunas> I hate when a character has a weapon that should reach halfway across the screen, and that character insists on hitting as close to their body as possible.
[0:49:34] <OkamiDude15> Yeah charlotta’s unique is a party/counter
[0:49:36] <crimsonsaens> That auto-corrects?
[0:49:37] <%ChoculaUltra> @JayEarly as someone who plays SRW and Gundam games - yes, yes it fucking does.
[0:49:38] <%ParmChampion> YERRRREER
[0:49:39] <OkamiDude15> Parry
[0:49:40] <Buka_Zero> nobody told woolie it comes in english?
[0:49:45] <Andrei11Droasca> Y would get this but o gotta exchange Euro into yen or sen and make a HK and ...ill just wait !
[0:49:55] <%yeknomlive> is that a bionic arm?
[0:49:59] <%RioGascar> @yeknomlive But if most of the competitve is on the early swing, what would the theoretical sales for the western release be like
[0:49:59] <+Taglog7> ABS 4 Days
[0:50:00] <grenadier42> mashed potato
[0:50:03] <NinjaGentleman> its more hassle than its worth imo
[0:50:06] <OkamiDude15> He probably couldn’t get cards for the hk or Taiwanese version
[0:50:07] <%FuqBoiSlim> BIONIC SCCYYYYYTHE
[0:50:09] <crimsonsaens> Woolie, Reggie doesn't know how to do the ultras
[0:50:09] <kuitlapiltsontli> They probably couldn't fing ps gift cards for the asian version so they went with JP
[0:50:10] <+Canorius> hk cards sold out unfortunately
[0:50:12] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oof, potat got mashed
[0:50:20] <%ChoculaUltra> bro - everyone's been telling Woolie it comes in english. He knows. It's just that HK psn cards are sold out in most places and he doesn't want to have to buy resale. That's it. That's the tweet.
[0:50:20] <+Sneakman98> Oh shit it's mini Honda
[0:50:21] <%RioGascar> I imagine due to the 1 month gap and being a fighting game the western release might be seen as a failure
[0:50:21] <%Irridium> some ultra skybounds confirm easier than others
[0:50:30] <yirawk> Can't you just paypal if you can't get cards?
[0:50:33] <Retolee> Reggie doing the normal skybound and not the super
[0:50:41] <%Solidnick18> get stepped on
[0:50:43] <rentalnico> i think granblue reddit said game had sold 150k already
[0:50:50] <StaceMcGate> So is big dude evil in lore or just misunderstood good boi?
[0:50:50] <gekizenbu> yep it has
[0:50:54] <JayEarly> most people don’t import
[0:50:55] <NinjaGentleman> so why exactly is it a month behind in western release? I would've imagined granblue would've shot for a global release
[0:50:57] <grenadier42> Vaseraga is a good boi
[0:50:58] <kuitlapiltsontli> Funny that nobody buys the malaysian version
[0:50:58] <MoonlightP> misunderstood good boi
[0:50:59] <faqmachine> @StaceMcGate good boi
[0:50:59] <+GreatSmasherPunch> he's a pure boi
[0:51:00] <neVan0> he good boi
[0:51:00] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Remember, there's also casual fans as well who just want the RPG mode or the eviolite
[0:51:01] <2fa2st2> goodest boi

[0:51:04] <+CMash2k> very good boi
[0:51:08] <+Clik404> Big dude is a good guy who works for the Illuminati kinda
[0:51:09] <Retolee> it's a month late because XSEED are bad
[0:51:09] <+tearknack> @StaceMcGate my udnerstanding is he's like, a cG barbarian type
[0:51:11] <gekizenbu> who is also like 25% robot at this point
[0:51:11] <Zerotoad5> Game comes with mobile codes it was going to sell
[0:51:13] <OkamiDude15> He makes dad jokes and gets sad when you ruin it
[0:51:13] <2fa2st2> not even misunderstood
[0:51:15] <Mvrdok_> @RioGascar You better look up Tekken 7 then
[0:51:18] <floralkami> Reggie should use his air presence more
[0:51:18] <%ChoculaUltra> he teams up with Axe Girl Zeta a lot
[0:51:18] <%RioGascar> I suppose i didnt consider that
[0:51:19] <SvenHolgersson> STOMP
[0:51:19] <%AtomicVR> This game's gonna sell tons just because it comes with in-game stuff for a game designed to funnel money from crazy people
[0:51:20] <+CMash2k> altered his body to become even gooder boy
[0:51:22] <crimsonsaens> All of the playable characters in this game are good guys
[0:51:24] <Andrei11Droasca> So chat ,let my fucking guess, she's like billion years old right?
[0:51:28] <MoonlightP> no
[0:51:29] <%AtomicVR> You think they can't sell that audience a $60 game?

[0:51:35] <faqmachine> @crimsonsaens so far
[0:51:38] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @StaceMcGate he has a hard time controlling his powers but he's pretty chill and stoic mostly
[0:51:39] <+thatskindaraven> legal
[0:51:42] <ShutUpSergeant> lol, suuuuuuure
[0:51:42] <%AlteisenReiseZ> She's 24, her race is short
[0:51:42] <rentalnico> like a 20 year old anime dwarf
[0:51:43] <exalt4747> Fucking caps and typo
[0:51:44] <exalt4747> 24
[0:51:45] <%Irridium> god the idea of people buying a full priced new game just for some gacha game code. Ugh.

[0:51:49] <Nekros4442> @Andrei11Droasca She's like early 20s. She's from a race of gnome-likes
[0:51:51] <MoonlightP> her race is just small. there's a lot of tiny old potato dudes in the game too
[0:51:52] <0rond> doesn't zeta also fight the moon fuckers?
[0:51:53] <kuitlapiltsontli> Charlotta is a harvin, AKA a gnome
[0:51:53] <%ChoculaUltra> idk about that - Charlotta is lawful evil don't @ me.
[0:51:54] <SvenHolgersson> BOOOOOOOOOM
[0:51:57] <+Clik404> @andrei11droasca no, just halflings

[0:52:08] <%Solidnick18> nah
[0:52:11] <Mix_Master_Mao> charlotta specifically has hangups about her height and seeks magic to fix that. Other harvins accept the potato life.
[0:52:15] <%ChoculaUltra> astral finish!
[0:52:18] <StaceMcGate> One more question about lore; is the big bad a dark dragon?
[0:52:20] <gekizenbu> but yeah belial and beelzebub will be fun entries once they come in

[0:52:23] <SvenHolgersson> TURN THAT POTATO INTO FRIES BOI
[0:52:27] <0rond> how does it feel woolie? to be SeCOnDarY

[0:52:28] <grenadier42> We don't even know who the big bad is.
[0:52:31] <Reizie_Etherealm> I am not a gnoblin, I am not a gnelf
[0:52:32] <Mix_Master_Mao> there isn't a big bad yet so far stance, the arcs change.

[0:52:55] <%yeknomlive> both these characters are sick
[0:52:56] <crimsonsaens> Japanese name
[0:52:56] <SvenHolgersson> Fastiva is her jap name
[0:52:56] <Nekros4442> Ladiva is the english
[0:52:57] <Dhurkst> different between versions
[0:52:57] <%kyh9> localization
[0:52:57] <grenadier42> Name's changed in the dub for whatever reason
[0:52:57] <gordieda20> BROFAM FOREVER
[0:52:58] <faqmachine> Fastiva is the japanese name
[0:52:58] <ShinySoulBlade> Localized name.
[0:52:58] <+GreatSmasherPunch> Japanese name is different
[0:52:59] <DedlokPM> @WoolieVersus Ladiva is the English name
[0:52:59] <%AlteisenReiseZ> EN - JP Translation
[0:53:00] <arkv01> yeah his japanese name is fastiva
[0:53:01] <+zalonar> JP name vs ENG name
[0:53:01] <Zerotoad5> Japanese names
[0:53:02] <Fujiwara_92> fastiva in Japan
[0:53:02] <+Toblo1> The Fuckboys Are Here To Say WAHEY
[0:53:04] <ElementalX1000> JP name
[0:53:04] <+SkaiVibration> one is jp name the other is eng name
[0:53:04] <+Narcowski> Name change between Japanese and International versions
[0:53:05] <HazaTheRaider> Ladiva is the ENG version
[0:53:06] <arkv01> localization thing
[0:53:07] <cj_art> ladiva is her localized name
[0:53:09] <gekizenbu> @WoolieVersus the game has a lot of localization stuff, even when Cygames translates in house
[0:53:09] <Nekros4442> It's just what the name is in English
[0:53:10] <%yeknomlive> livin' ladiva loca
[0:53:12] <Pnutz409> Ladiva gdlk!
[0:53:13] <+GreatSmasherPunch> Ladiva is the best mom
[0:53:15] <%Irridium> so why doesn't the announcer say ladiva
[0:53:15] <2fa2st2> localized names for NO real reason
[0:53:15] <StaceMcGate> Fantasy Puri Puri Prisoner
[0:53:18] <Vortigon> PC when? HahaCat
[0:53:19] <%Solidnick18> Time for pro wrestling
[0:53:19] <kuitlapiltsontli> Ladiva is the anme in english translation
[0:53:20] <+Narcowski> Literally says Fastiva for her name in the Japanese though
[0:53:22] <%ChoculaUltra> one of the big bads is a big dark dragon, yes, but there's a pantheon of villains that aren't all working together. Just various groups/people trying to fuck up the GBF world in their own way
[0:53:22] <kyesuki> wrestling name
[0:53:22] <OkamiDude15> Fastiva because Japanese can’t do Ls
[0:53:22] <Mix_Master_Mao> there are two dragons who are causing conflict in tthe worlds, but it's only because they're separate fragments of god who want to rejoin and become God again.
[0:53:22] <+President_Miyazaki> Ladiva is a big and strong lady who will support you.
[0:53:23] <+quackisalive> You wait for the ternals
[0:53:23] <arkv01> cause LA DIVA
[0:53:24] <%ParmChampion> GIB LADIVA
[0:53:25] <crimsonsaens> Cygames makes some questionable names in localization
[0:53:25] <grenadier42> Early Granblue had a really weird localization
[0:53:26] <Tntwelve> Lilwayne Kappa
[0:53:26] <PERCYMaybach> lowain is annoying because of his dumb super every round
[0:53:27] <+quackisalive> They have the worst localization.
[0:53:27] <%ParmChampion> YESSSSSSSSSS
[0:53:27] <+eanscrale> Happens in Pokemon
[0:53:27] <%kyh9> Xenoblade 2 has the nuttiest case of it
[0:53:28] <%AlteisenReiseZ> LET THE INTO ROCK
[0:53:28] <Andrei11Droasca> Suplex this men with love <3
[0:53:32] <%Solidnick18> Now this is grabble
[0:53:33] <Kristoffers> Only localize Donald Duck pun names
[0:53:33] <Ultimatefool> LIVING LADIVA LOCA
[0:53:34] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @StaceMcGate the big bads of granblue are primordial gods, the large dragon, bahamut, is god
[0:53:35] <grenadier42> They don't really do that stuff anymore
[0:53:36] <HazaTheRaider> LOVE TIME
[0:53:37] <transporterthesequel> Because La Diva is a better english name
[0:53:37] <2fa2st2> I just don't get it man
[0:53:37] <KitsuneManami> WEEL OF FATE IS TURNING
[0:53:38] <Mix_Master_Mao> just call her Ladiva, that's what she is in the english translation
[0:53:40] <faqmachine> no, Ladiva's just her name
[0:53:44] <kuitlapiltsontli> Xenoblade series name changes are weird
[0:53:44] <%kyh9> Xenoblade 2 is nuttier: characters have their japanese names translated to ancient greek ones
[0:53:44] <Reizie_Etherealm> Monhun is the worst it's ever been in terms of having different names for EN and JP
[0:53:46] <Dragon_Batman> Maybe they don't wanna go different from the anime for confusion?
[0:53:46] <+Narcowski> I was trying to figure out the lore behind the name change, there's apparently no real reason behind it
[0:53:47] <2fa2st2> why does Rastina turn into Razia
[0:53:50] <Fujiwara_92> wait her?
[0:53:51] <%ParmChampion> LADIVA NUMBER ONEEEEEEEE
[0:53:52] <sperium3000> You can just call her Ladiva
[0:53:55] <Mix_Master_Mao> its not nearly as bad as the what they changed the eternals to.
[0:53:55] <fascistznik> best characters
[0:53:55] <RogerPoore> @WoolieVersus All the translations are from the Cygames internal translation
[0:53:58] <Pnutz409> Ladiva is the best. Best super! 11/10
[0:53:58] <sperium3000> @Fujiwara_92 She's trans
[0:53:59] <MoonlightP> they used to do some of that in the early tl, nowadays though they keep it consistent unless there's some specific localization quibble to transfer meaning
[0:54:00] <zenith0111> @choculaultra So typical fighting game shenanigans
[0:54:00] <$Noponiz> xenoblade 2 names are the worst ever
[0:54:00] <Nekros4442> Also....think about Japanese accents. Ladiva would be "Radiva"

[0:57:04] <OkamiDude15> @huntercd trans who doesn’t want to change the body her parents gave me
[0:57:04] <faqmachine> You can dodge all of them
[0:57:07] <OkamiDude15> Her
[0:57:09] <+Canorius> ladiva our queen
[0:57:15] <SvenHolgersson> The best part is the win screen for Lowain
[0:57:17] <+ChrisAlgoo> @Huntercd word? that's rad
[0:57:17] <JayEarly> what was the giant waifu?
[0:57:19] <zenith0111> @faqmachine Good luck with that tho
[0:57:19] <%ParmChampion> one of the few times i wish i could pick two charactwrs so i could get vaseraga and ladiva on one team woolieOMG woolieOMG
[0:57:21] <Reizie_Etherealm> Those are some huge butterflies
[0:57:26] <Mix_Master_Mao> full disclosure ladiva got the option to change her body to a womans from the resident alchemist (who did it to himself). LAdiva said no because she considers her body a gift.
[0:57:27] <SvenHolgersson> It's the greatest 4th wall break in universe ever
[0:57:29] <sperium3000> Yo Ladiva is the shit. Her super is a pin with an actual countdown
[0:57:30] <DedlokPM> @StaceMcGate All of Lowains fights are not real. It is just him and his buddies imagining how fights would go while drinking in a bar.
[0:57:30] <PERCYMaybach> yeah, lowains super are all trash since thye been figured out now basically
[0:57:31] <shazbot2019> Wait when did this finally roll out? What rock have I been under all this time?
[0:57:31] <blackkanye> @OkamiDude15 that is actually super cute and makes me like ladiva even more
[0:57:32] <%Solidnick18> goddamn
[0:57:34] <Nina96> wow
[0:57:39] <ChillySofa> the giant waifu is yggdrasil
[0:57:40] <snowmanie> these dirty crossups
[0:57:40] <Huntercd> Oh okay still a lady
[0:57:45] <%Solidnick18> OH
[0:57:46] <%Irridium> ladiva can just run a train on you if you let her
[0:57:49] <+tearknack> @shazbot2019 its out in japan
[0:57:49] <zenith0111> @percymaybach Actually no
[0:57:50] <keiji_maede> PIN THIS ASSHOLE!!
[0:57:51] <Nina96> i know who iam gonna play now
[0:57:56] <SvenHolgersson> @Irridium yes please
[0:58:01] <jorniev> pin him
[0:58:01] <+Mr_Initials> woolie is running a train right now
[0:58:01] <SomersaultJustice> land the super with the animation!
[0:58:05] <2fa2st2> the deal woth the boys is that when they hang out they start making up stories to tell each other and eventually they always turn into kaiju battles
[0:58:05] <zenith0111> @percymaybach Serious players HATE that super
[0:58:10] <grenadier42> Ladiva's character is shockingly decently done considering how much potential there was for Cygames to just be super offensive
[0:58:12] <Buka_Zero> yhe new r mika
[0:58:13] <ficboyog> w8 its a she???
[0:58:15] <+CMash2k> headbutt cancels projectiles btw
[0:58:19] <Pnutz409> did Woolie run Ladivas level 3 yet?
[0:58:20] <+Grizzytron> I can't stand playing gachas and I'm trash at fighters. Sincerely hoping the wait for GBF Relink isn't too long
[0:58:22] <OkamiDude15> @blackkanye ladiva has event where she runs a bar on the airship to help other characters out with their persona problems
[0:58:23] <+ReiDuran> Ladiva's a she, yeah
[0:58:24] <fascistznik> finish with the pin BlessRNG
[0:58:24] <kuitlapiltsontli> Woolie would love Geisenborger in this game since he is a gaint JoJo reference
[0:58:35] <heartlesshealer> Yeah, Ladiva's great
[0:58:37] <+Terrabyte0> LA DI VA Let's gooo
[0:58:38] <JayEarly> why does Lowain have a robot girl
[0:58:38] <ernie_turbo23> Ladiva is a guy in the lore pretending to be a women
[0:58:38] <%croxeye> ladiva/fastiva is a she yeah
[0:58:39] <DedlokPM> @ficboyog Yes, Ladiva is a she.
[0:58:39] <PERCYMaybach> @zenith0111 guess it's mixed, it's annoying time waster that can be easily dodged unless you use it for a chip kill
[0:58:40] <exalt4747> It's too bad Burger's character isn't better though
[0:58:40] <gekizenbu> all of Lowain's events end in a giant mecha battle
[0:58:40] <sperium3000> @blackkanye To elaborate, in an event an alchemist who put his mind in the body of a little girl to live forever offers Ladiva to give her the perfect female body, and Ladiva refuses because her body is the one her parents gave her and she loves it for it.
[0:58:43] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @kuitlapiltsontli And Nicholas/Shiro too
[0:58:43] <Rngiddion> what a wonderful dan
[0:58:43] <gordieda20> KATAPILLAR
[0:58:44] <MoonlightP> lowain has an item mechanic where he pulls out food and katapillar can also shoot a bunch of missiles
[0:58:46] <Mix_Master_Mao> isn't geisenborger also one of the few evokers who's not a bad dude?
[0:58:51] <+tearknack> @ernie_turbo23 hey fuck off

[0:58:53] <SomersaultJustice> WOOOOOOO

[1:01:15] <%croxeye> so if a lowain main wins evo, did he really win??
[1:01:18] <sperium3000> @Mix_Master_Mao And why is she helping the bro squad?
[1:01:20] <gekizenbu> lowain's eng dub is pretty solid

[1:01:44] <+tearknack> @Noponiz cause everyone was, so prices went UP
[1:01:51] <Vortigon> does the english version still have the japanese voices available?
[1:01:52] <Mix_Master_Mao> @sperium3000 because elsam, one of the boys, has a crush on her. So in their imagination she fights with them. In the Boys' events Elsam becomes super robot Elsam and as tall as Yggy to be with her.

[1:05:06] <OkamiDude15> @gekizenbu i wish i had your luck
[1:05:10] <+Valask> he looks like a fate character
[1:05:10] <Reizie_Etherealm> So out of all these characters all of them are phyisical melee with only 1 bow and nothing else?
[1:05:13] <2fa2st2> the only one getting ara-ara'd by Katalina is Vyrn
[1:05:22] <StaceMcGate> seriously, is that armor or clothing LUL
[1:05:23] <matheuspomp> you are not immune to hot lady knight
[1:05:24] <gekizenbu> @OkamiDude15 trust me i wish my luck was this good
[1:05:25] <+quackisalive> As a fire lord Percy looks weird without his summer skin.
[1:05:26] <%ChoculaUltra> Macho Vyrn should've been the last boss imo.
[1:05:30] <Mix_Master_Mao> I want them to put in Macho Vee, playable only on april 1st
[1:05:33] <abusywizard> Max’s Percival is actually scary

[1:05:36] <nothuzad> Reizie_Etherealm 1 whip 1 bow 1 "trio" with daggers 1 wrestling lady
[1:05:37] <%MoralCompassGaming> @zenith0111 have you tried any Apple Arcade games? proper games and no micro-transactions or time-gates.
[1:05:38] <gekizenbu> Macho Vryn should havebeen the first dlC
[1:05:39] <+SirGO0SE> just looks like anime fire emblems on screen r/n

[1:05:52] <+Dr_DangerPhD> that grab gives you a free followup
[1:05:53] <+Kiaayo> @sperium3000 it's an app store that lets you download foreign apps that google doesn't let you have, it's kinda cool if you like foreign games

[1:06:13] <crimsonsaens> Woolie's super mashing skill is too strong
[1:06:20] <Pnutz409> Who ya got winning dbfz world tour?
[1:06:24] <+tearknack> @Mix_Master_Mao does the setting have anything for someone who doesn't enjoy generic vaguely european fantasy kitchen sinks?
[1:06:25] <+Dr_DangerPhD> you can charge both his supers to be unblockable as well

[1:06:53] <gekizenbu> @tearknack sometimes the events are "Whatever the fuck the writers are watching this week" sometimes you get Actual Bollywood, sometimes its speed racer, sometimes its just Kamen Rider
[1:06:53] <+lumporr> new setup lookin great woolie
[1:06:56] <Reizie_Etherealm> PogChamp
[1:06:59] <2fa2st2> @tearknack it's got Metal Gears from the Moon

[1:07:06] <sperium3000> Max seems to be maining Percy
[1:07:08] <+tearknack> thats neat
[1:07:09] <Mix_Master_Mao> @tearknack gbf is a kitchen sink itself with settings and shit. Think One Piece. There's events that are character focussed and focussed on things with different tech levels.
[1:07:10] <+NobleJedi> PogChamp
[1:07:12] <%Solidnick18> oh man
[1:07:12] <bigboy3d> woolieTRASH
[1:07:15] <grenadier42> there was that one Sharknado homage event
[1:07:19] <bigboy3d> New emote yeah!
[1:07:21] <zenith0111> There are Hard Combo Limits in this game btw
[1:07:23] <OkamiDude15> the word your looking for is autamagod
[1:07:24] <+tearknack> @grenadier42 wut
[1:07:27] <gekizenbu> oh yeah one of the events was literally voiced by the EN and JP cast of Sharknado
[1:07:28] <Pnutz409> Fen was super strong today. hope it carries over.
[1:07:32] <Nina96> oh wait this is fire ve ice
[1:07:32] <grenadier42> @tearknack i shit you not
[1:07:38] <matheuspomp> it got a chainsaw dwarf
[1:07:38] <zenith0111> Not a lot of combo freedom
[1:07:38] <gordieda20> Yo wat
[1:07:42] <Mix_Master_Mao> the main story is 'fantasy medieval' I suppose but it never lets it be a barrier to itself imo. There's tech and shit, robots, golems. Some stuff may feel generic but the designs all look good.
[1:07:42] <%MoralCompassGaming> @zenith0111 5$ for 100+ games with no micro transactions that you keep even if your sub runs out. pretty good to me for dealing with apple if you only play mobile games. i don't but i've worked on hundreds

[1:07:48] <HazaTheRaider> miss katalina take me as your housewiiiife
[1:07:52] <%AlteisenReiseZ> We recently had an event where we have to go to the moon to fuck them up
[1:07:53] <Mix_Master_Mao> tbh platinum sky 2 was mid.
[1:07:55] <gekizenbu> @tearknack more specifically it turned into JAWS vs SHARKNADO
[1:07:59] <%Valask> Number ip Pog
[1:08:04] <%Valask> Big number Pog
[1:08:10] <grenadier42> the main story is boring as fuck which is why nobody cares about the main story, it's all about the events
[1:08:11] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Society events are great
[1:08:23] <Mix_Master_Mao> people say the main story gets good after the first major arc
[1:08:26] <kuitlapiltsontli> Last Society event was dark af
[1:08:27] <grenadier42> eh... sorta
[1:08:28] <zenith0111> @moralcompassgaming I don't like playing on my phone
[1:08:32] <phatmac16> The story gets good during the Black Knight arc
[1:08:33] <+timbob> Oh yes hello mr wools how do you do
[1:08:35] <Mix_Master_Mao> last society event... needs more Ilsa
[1:08:42] <%ChoculaUltra> the Wall arc was dope af tho
[1:08:44] <MoonlightP> the main story gets real good later tbh

[1:09:50] <OkamiDude15> @phatmac16 probably not since her and ilsa are color pallettes for zeta
[1:09:50] <fairore> @itsgutsnotgatsu who?
[1:09:51] <PKSomething> is sound supposed to be muted?
[1:09:52] <PluckyLuck> HHYYYYYPPPPEEE
[1:09:54] <HazaTheRaider> Add Tweyen/Silva as a combo unit, they're lesbians anyway
[1:09:56] <%Valask> no

[1:10:02] <crimsonsaens> It's very Street Fighter

[1:10:15] <%Dr_Mooose> @croxeye thank you for the sub PogChamp
[1:10:17] <Mix_Master_Mao> @OkamiDude15 not so, theres more colour palettes for characters already in game so we can't know for certain.
[1:10:18] <phatmac16> Zooey is the last dlc character for sure
[1:10:19] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @gekizenbu a man of quality
[1:10:26] <Zack_Ward> projWAVE
[1:10:28] <%AlteisenReiseZ> But the game needs more harvins
[1:10:29] <BallerSwagBro9k> WE NEED MORE HYPE
[1:10:30] <+NecDW4> @WoolieVersus does this seem like it will be easy to learn for literal newbies? Like, "i played SF2 on the SNES back in the day a couple times but that's it" level?
[1:10:35] <%AlteisenReiseZ> gotta get a balance
[1:10:35] <+Clik404> Please let them add Zoi
[1:10:37] <sperium3000> He did the gatotsu
[1:10:38] <%ChoculaUltra> Eustace would be dope! Knives/guns/cqc etc
[1:10:38] <+ReiDuran> man someone needs to finish with a level 2
[1:10:39] <Mix_Master_Mao> chat moving too quickly, whose model is already in game?
[1:10:42] <%Beruptor> Beruptor subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:10:43] <OkamiDude15> zooey uses gun or sword? i forget
[1:10:45] <gekizenbu> @AlteisenReiseZ when's Sevibarra
[1:10:45] <faqmachine> Y'all need to Katalina's stand
[1:10:45] <MoonlightP> this game is very easy to pick up and play
[1:10:46] <brunoberserk> woolieYE
[1:10:49] <itsgutsnotgatsu> Silva would basically be elphelt, so ASW would understand how to implement her
[1:10:49] <gekizenbu> @OkamiDude15 both
[1:10:50] <MoonlightP> like explicitly designed to riff off sf2
[1:10:52] <+mans51> which one of these is byleth? 🤔
[1:10:52] <Mariakko> Put the potato back on screen
[1:10:54] <+quackisalive> zoi uses sword primarily
[1:11:02] <Mix_Master_Mao> @OkamiDude15 sword, gun, big sword, spear.
[1:11:06] <MoonlightP> zoi should be gundam zoi
[1:11:09] <itsgutsnotgatsu> they'd almost certainly add sword Zooey but she also has a gun form
[1:11:12] <phatmac16> Silvia would one shot the cast of her skills are like in the game lol
[1:11:13] <tetrabrick1lt> LUL LUL
[1:11:18] <%ParmChampion> @mans51 woolie/percival
[1:11:20] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Sevilbarra, Arulumaya, Yodarha, or Skull i'd be hype for
[1:11:22] <Reizie_Etherealm> You might be cool but are you cape AND coat cool
[1:11:23] <+Falkdaddu> Thanks for the LuvBrownL @croxeye
[1:11:23] <kuitlapiltsontli> @quackisalive Zoi is most likely the last DLC character since she is in RPG mode and she has some fanart in the game featuring her alone while other characters are accompanied by atleast one of the playable characters
[1:11:26] <matheuspomp> zoi has shield on the model in game tho
[1:11:28] <%Valask> get sasugad
[1:11:29] <+AsheDaBish> Does Percy have an Aglo color?
[1:11:29] <OkamiDude15> @Mix_Master_Mao well they for sure arent gonna put in her SR fire version

[1:19:52] <matheuspomp> out japan
[1:19:54] <gekizenbu> @dan_g_v if they dont change her moveset, basiccally just the same as Female Pokemon Trainer vs Male Pokemon Trainer
[1:19:56] <%croxeye> this game is out in asia, so they imported it
[1:19:58] <Totaliss> BEGONE THOT
[1:19:58] <DedlokPM> @laguerrilha out in japan and hong kong. US is march
[1:20:01] <Dhurkst> GENERIC TRIO AF
[1:20:01] <+Crimznking> @mix_master_mao I don't think so, she just has fuck busted sight levels
[1:20:02] <%ChoculaUltra> Black Knight haaaas to be playable of any of the Luminary Knights tbh.
[1:20:02] <%croxeye> the SEA version has english as well
[1:20:03] <+HakureiIllusion> Why does Lyria's color scheme have to change though
[1:20:03] <+Toblo1> Begone THOT
[1:20:04] <SvenHolgersson> Grans girl is cute as FUCK tho
[1:20:04] <laguerrilha> oh ok :(
[1:20:05] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I honestly think the last character for season 1 will be Cagliostro
[1:20:05] <%fattness132> His purity is saved
[1:20:06] <phatmac16> Sex denied
[1:20:06] <%Irridium> hong kong got full english though
[1:20:06] <Nina96> BEGONE
[1:20:09] <zenith0111> KAWAIIII~
[1:20:11] <Mix_Master_Mao> green rruria is cute
[1:20:12] <+TopTieramisu> man, this guy looks so lame
[1:20:12] <+Bear_Mane> those bonerflys explode
[1:20:14] <phatmac16> LYRIA WINS
[1:20:14] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> lyria's innocent eyes were protected
[1:20:16] <jase__x> Lame ass hero
[1:20:19] <Andrei11Droasca> This has that Blazeblue problem where the characters wont shut the fuck up
[1:20:20] <OkamiDude15> @dan_g_v they are essentially the same character. but they might give her some class change stuff
[1:20:25] <%Irridium> he certainly is Protagonist Man
[1:20:37] <+SirGO0SE> oh man she kinda plays like hawk eye
[1:20:38] <%Max_Kaiser> I actually really like gran
[1:20:39] <Mix_Master_Mao> it's not far how they do my man Gran like this.
[1:20:40] <zenith0111> Yeah Gram has the lamest design and animations compared to everyome
[1:20:42] <+TopTieramisu> dooooou?
[1:20:44] <gekizenbu> Protagonist Hoodie is pretty comfy tho
[1:20:45] <phatmac16> He’s better than the FGO protagonist at least
[1:20:45] <+Toblo1> I kinda wish they gave Gran some cross-class stuff to do
[1:20:46] <Nekros4442> @TopTieramisu Yep, he's supposed to. He's basically a Squire from FFT. He has all these job changes
[1:20:48] <Pnutz409> soul fist soul fist
[1:20:52] <Bruno_Tropical> Generic-Kun
[1:20:52] <SvenHolgersson> Reminds me of that witch from BBTag
[1:20:53] <matheuspomp> DODGE
[1:20:55] <+Toblo1> Kinda like how Bartz worked in Dissidia
[1:20:58] <Mix_Master_Mao> you get all the classes you could possibly want. but he's always sword fighter protag.
[1:20:58] <Dhurkst> He's just "level 10 MMO noob"
[1:20:58] <MoonlightP> gran actually gets really cool art in the original game
[1:20:59] <neVan0> lucha gran or FEED
[1:21:02] <%ChoculaUltra> Gachapin & Mukku as a tag character tho
[1:21:05] <zayasu> Kreygasm
[1:21:05] <laguerrilha> How many characters does the game have?
[1:21:07] <sleepy_pink> wrow
[1:21:07] <+Toblo1> Wait no, Bartz or Onion Knight
[1:21:08] <Deadbulky> Nyah Kreygasm
[1:21:08] <MoonlightP> his hoodie form is wack though
[1:21:11] <%Irridium> 11
[1:21:12] <gekizenbu> Gachapin would be too OP for this game
[1:21:15] <+Mr_Initials> F off gachapin
[1:21:18] <Pnutz409> dat trumpet doe
[1:21:18] <+Clik404> Gran’s neat because he starts generic as fuck and can become a bunny mage by the end of his class tree
[1:21:18] <+Dr_DangerPhD> the fact she gets a flash kick anti air super on top of her zoning game is just evil lmao
[1:21:21] <Mix_Master_Mao> 11+1 who can be unlocked from hardmode/ season pass but isn't playable yet.
[1:21:22] <OkamiDude15> gachapin too strong for versus
[1:21:24] <zenith0111> atpSolid Mata mata
[1:21:24] <%croxeye> 11 at launch and like 4 or 5 in the first DLC pass
[1:21:25] <+SirGO0SE> yeah dont you guys love ska
[1:21:25] <%AlteisenReiseZ> They should have Luchador Gran
[1:21:26] <yirawk> It'd be nice if they gave him his ewternal costume
[1:21:32] <Ashenik1> Wait no Doom today ?? :<
[1:21:32] <Dragon_Batman> Strong stance there
[1:21:32] <SvenHolgersson> Brass boiz 4 lyfe
[1:21:36] <laguerrilha> Ok, good enough for the start. i am sure they will release more as dlc
[1:21:36] <%kapcommunist> trombones ftw!
[1:21:37] <+Toblo1> Drummer Gran would've been hilarious
[1:21:38] <+McSoliace> i feel like if gran's face were different he would immediately look cooler
[1:21:38] <Dragon_Batman> Doom is later
[1:21:40] <+Grizzytron> honestly gran just looking like A Dude™ is honestly novel compared to the rest of the cast here
[1:21:41] <MoonlightP> get hype for chad djeeta in a month
[1:21:43] <Dhurkst> @Ashenik1 it'll be later
[1:21:46] <OkamiDude15> eternal gran would be sick
[1:21:49] <jetswerve> Wait for all Gran’s class changes to get in as DLC
[1:21:54] <MoonlightP> or like 2 months
[1:21:56] <MoonlightP> idk
[1:21:58] <Andrei11Droasca> Wen's doom exactly?
[1:21:58] <%croxeye> and honestly with a lower number of characters they get a chance to really differentiate each character while keeping the balance fairly good
[1:22:01] <Mix_Master_Mao> no way please don't goku it up arcsys please.
[1:22:02] <+Mr_Initials> Eternal Detja
[1:22:03] <+quackisalive> @Clik404 forget bunny mage... he can become Rambo or a cat cosplayer
[1:22:06] <Hellarussian> thot 2 strong
[1:22:09] <Twoiis> Do you guys ever find yourself using the shortcuts?

[1:22:40] <Mix_Master_Mao> @Crimznking jannu is very popular ho wever she's originally a Rage of Bahamut character so that might be a mark against her.

[1:22:56] <%ParmChampion> honestly understandable
[1:23:01] <crimsonsaens> Metera is ara ara and hora hora combined
[1:23:02] <MoonlightP> the ova was that too, where djeeta just trivializes everything in the story
[1:23:03] <%ParmChampion> gran just looks like a kid in a hoodie
[1:23:06] <%ChoculaUltra> also Fish Lyria should be in game somewhere as something.
[1:23:20] <AutolycusLive> I mean. He is
[1:23:20] <+quackisalive> @MoonlightP surrounded by a harem of waifu.
[1:23:22] <+TeethMuncher> Man, zoners are the best

[1:25:08] <Mix_Master_Mao> anyone here heard the version of Dark Crimson Wings in this game? it's good
[1:25:09] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I wonder if a harp user gets in
[1:25:16] <Andrei11Droasca> He main character right?
[1:25:19] <OkamiDude15> yee
[1:25:21] <+munsterzero> In the ending Gran becomes Victor Von Doom
[1:25:21] <Hellarussian> ye
[1:25:21] <%xeromage> no projectile run
[1:25:25] <zenith0111> @andrei11droasca No
[1:25:29] <zenith0111> Kappa
[1:25:33] <phatmac16> I wish Lyria could summon people like in the game
[1:25:35] <+TopTieramisu> dooooou?
[1:25:44] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Andrei11Droasca the male mc yeah, the female, djeeta, is coming later
[1:25:44] <%ChoculaUltra> no, Djeeta is MC, Gran is the rival character Kappa
[1:25:53] <OkamiDude15> lyria gets in and all her attacks are primal beasts summons
[1:25:53] <%gatorafan> So, as someone who has no idea about the source material, what criteria are they using for the character picks?
[1:25:53] <Applecannon63> maybe Gran as evil Ryu
[1:25:58] <%gatorafan> Popularity? Sotry relevancy?
[1:25:58] <+ReiDuran> THE OVERHEAD
[1:26:00] <Hellarussian> Grans virginity lives to see another day

[1:26:02] <garrulousAuthority> USE THE SPIN
[1:26:03] <+Terrabyte0> Thotslayer Gran
[1:26:03] <Thalchampz> OVERHEADDOI
[1:26:08] <goose_attack_almanac> @Andrei11Droasca Gran is the Male Avatar of Granblue fantasy. He has a female counter part. But for the most part Gran is the Protagonist
[1:26:11] <%Prevot> VIRGINITY DEFENDED
[1:26:12] <zenith0111> KAWAIIIIII~
[1:26:13] <phatmac16> Popularity and fighting game mechanics
[1:26:15] <VJdarkworld> zelda is the MC of legend of zelda Kappa
[1:26:16] <%Max_Kaiser> This is cute
[1:26:19] <Totaliss> VIRGINITY DEFENDED!
[1:26:21] <+Clik404> @gatorafan popularity maybe/what would translate best to a fighting game
[1:26:22] <Mix_Master_Mao> @gatorafan absolutely no idea. I assume a mix of popularity and how interesting they think the fighter would be/how archetype fulfilling they are.
[1:26:26] <+TopTieramisu> @goose_attack_almanac is female gran as boring looking?
[1:26:27] <%ChoculaUltra> @gatorafan the gbf community has been trying to figure it out lmao
[1:26:28] <%yeknomlive> justin wong was using her earlier and yeah
[1:26:31] <+quackisalive> @gatorafan Seems to be story relevent with a mix of popular.
[1:26:32] <phatmac16> LYRIA WINS
[1:26:40] <PERCYMaybach> metera top 3
[1:26:41] <+HakureiIllusion> Djeeta is mega-cute and everyone uses her in GBF anyway
[1:26:44] <%valriot> DOOOO
[1:26:46] <rasamune> I just hope they add Cag at some point
[1:26:46] <%gatorafan> I got every answer possible and that answered nothing LUL
[1:26:47] <+TopTieramisu> justin wong loves that lame stuff
[1:26:47] <Deadbulky> Im gonna play lance waifu
[1:26:50] <%AlteisenReiseZ> it's wierd, once you get on top of Metera, she can't really do anything... Kappa
[1:26:51] <Mix_Master_Mao> I don't use Djeeta and I'm rank 152.
[1:26:51] <Applecannon63> Does Gran have a evil Ryu archetype to be available for DLC?
[1:26:55] <gordieda20> GRAN PRESSURE
[1:26:59] <%gatorafan> Thanks guys
[1:27:00] <+Clik404> @gatorafan so basically whatever the fuck they want
[1:27:01] <+mccf> he has a color
[1:27:04] <faqmachine> @Applecannon63 Djeeta
[1:27:06] <+tearknack> @TopTieramisu female gran, from what i've seen, looks way better. her design really reminds me of the characters from fftactics
[1:27:06] <phatmac16> Ladivia isn’t a popular character but got in do to being a grappler
[1:27:06] <rentalnico> maybe eternal gran
[1:27:08] <Andrei11Droasca> By the way if overhead counters you can combo into hards from it @woolieversus
[1:27:13] <rasamune> It'd be weird if they didn't. Everyone loves Cag
[1:27:15] <%ChoculaUltra> cuz there are some characters from gbf that get like a new character iteration damn near every year that aren't in the game yet while there are some deep cut picks like Lowain who's never had an SSR iteration
[1:27:19] <yirawk> Blue Gran
[1:27:26] <+quackisalive> Ladiva is pretty popular @phatmac16
[1:27:34] <+tearknack> whats an SSR iteraiton?
[1:27:37] <garrulousAuthority> How many Vira's @ChoculaUltra
[1:27:37] <zenith0111> Overhead combos atpHorns atpGasm atpHorns
[1:27:44] <crimsonsaens> I'd be surprised if Vira doesn't get in later
[1:27:46] <OkamiDude15> @Applecannon63 i guess that would be his alter ego skin but probably not gonna be in the game
[1:27:51] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @tearknack pretty much the highest rarity
[1:27:57] <goose_attack_almanac> @tearknack Makes sense. Its the same guy making the art
[1:27:58] <nothuzad> phatmac16 ladiva is popular but not the MOST popular like djeeta, zeta(well mostly her halloween costume) and narmaya
[1:27:58] <reasonance> so weird to see all these characters I know from great doujins come to life
[1:28:01] <%Theycallmenerf> Is there a beginners Blue Gran to start the series in? Or is it just the latest version has the best roster?
[1:28:01] <faqmachine> @tearknack Characters in GBF can have different versions of varying rarities, SSR is the highest, Lowain doesn't have one
[1:28:08] <InugamiTheHound> Grand wizard Wakka!
[1:28:10] <OldManDeckardCain> they confirmed that the last character for season 1 is gonna be a female
[1:28:11] <%ChoculaUltra> @garrulousAuthority like 5 Viras? there's a new promo one you get from getting the dvd of season 2 with a spicy red formal dress
[1:28:12] <rasamune> @tearknack Characters can have multiple versions; SSRs are the rarest and most powerful characters
[1:28:14] <Mix_Master_Mao> for characters in mobile game, there's R (trash) SR (mostly trash) and SSR (mostly good).
[1:28:18] <+Toblo1> @tearknack most characters have different rarity variations
[1:28:25] <nothuzad> OldManDeckardCain its gonna be Vira SeriousSloth
[1:28:31] <ElementalX1000> Put Spinnah in the game you cowards
[1:28:36] <OkamiDude15> grand lowain nkoBless
[1:28:36] <zenith0111> Gacha games are literally made by Satan. Prove me wrong!
[1:28:36] <Fujiwara_92> wakka as dlc PogChamp
[1:28:42] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Hey @Mix_Master_Mao , leave Jamil, JJ, and Mirin out of this :<
[1:28:45] <+Toblo1> Usually based off Sesonal events or character development that was generated through story events
[1:28:45] <Totaliss> Satan doesnt exist
[1:28:47] <Gralevert> spinnah best r character
[1:28:47] <+tearknack> @Mix_Master_Mao wait rare's are trash? god, and i thought mtg was bad
[1:28:47] <Totaliss> checkmate
[1:28:49] <+quackisalive> @Theycallmenerf There is only one version of the main game. There is however babies first granblue which is Draglia Lost
[1:28:51] <Mix_Master_Mao> lol @AlteisenReiseZ
[1:28:55] <phatmac16> @nothuzad Yeah like there are a lot of other more popular characters that weren’t added like Vira or Jeanne
[1:28:55] <%ChoculaUltra> I'd love to see Yodarha for more Harvin rep tbh
[1:28:56] <+Canorius> its probably gonna be zooey
[1:29:01] <zenith0111> @totaliss atpFeelsBeardMan atpLaw
[1:29:02] <superInazuma> Your 2C antiair can combo into 214b by whiffing 214a first
[1:29:06] <+Crimznking> How long till we get Eternals or Zodiac Generals?
[1:29:07] <yirawk> I'd really like Walder
[1:29:10] <+munsterzero> Everyone plays the same characters. Gran, the girl in armor, the girl with the arrow, the the whip girl, and ladiva.
[1:29:10] <+GreatSmasherPunch> Your weapon grid matters more than characters and that is all grind
[1:29:11] <Hellarussian> thottery ceased
[1:29:19] <Mix_Master_Mao> @tearknack 'commons' also exist but not as characters. Characters can only be R, SR and SSR.
[1:29:20] <Andrei11Droasca> So wat the chat tells me is that the granblues can evolve like them pokemens
[1:29:23] <%FuqBoiSlim> Thot: Patrolled
[1:29:23] <jetswerve> I hope Albert gets in sooner or later.
[1:29:24] <zenith0111> Kawaiiiiii~
[1:29:25] <Quietshun13> @tearknack rares aren't actually rare
[1:29:29] <neVan0> grea would be cool
[1:29:30] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @tearknack rares are rare in name only
[1:29:33] <+Toblo1> @Crimznking I'd be interested if they put in any of the Evokers
[1:29:34] <+WordsHere> kowai jermaFear
[1:29:35] <crimsonsaens> Reggie confirmed to hate feet and sex
[1:29:39] <%valriot> Gran: "If she breathes..."
[1:29:40] <%KingLlama1> Ferry time
[1:29:40] <OkamiDude15> im guessing zodiacs,eternals, or evokers are probably gonna be in the second season pass
[1:29:41] <+tearknack> then why call htem rares damnit
[1:29:44] <%foreverN2dust> Reggie sure did well while playing the flagship character....
[1:29:45] <CrypticMochi> Didn’t they say they were splitting characters between this and their RPG?
[1:29:46] <rasamune> @Crimznking I don't know if we will; they're kind of a package deal and that's Too Many Characters
[1:29:48] <nothuzad> druggles
[1:29:48] <OkamiDude15> primals too
[1:29:49] <Ferroflux> add feower and i buy it
[1:29:49] <phatmac16> Virginity protected
[1:29:50] <Fujiwara_92> not kawaii, kowai monkaS
[1:29:52] <+quackisalive> GBF mobage just gives you tons of rolls and you end up with most all the characters you'd ever need. The real grind is the weapons and that's all f2p
[1:29:52] <%Prevot> ARMPITS
[1:29:54] <Quietshun13> @tearknack lul I dunno
[1:29:55] <%ECRead> PITS
[1:29:56] <heartlesshealer> Spirit whip!
[1:29:56] <%ChoculaUltra> @Andrei11Droasca yes and no, there are multiple versions of a character and all characters can be "limit broken" to a certain max level depending on their rarity
[1:29:57] <Pnutz409> Armpit!
[1:29:59] <tri3dgE027> Why did Woolie buy the JP version instead of the HK / Taiwan Version that has English Localization?
[1:30:01] <%Irridium> she's a bitch to fight with that whip

[1:35:43] <+Mr_Initials> Fushigi
[1:35:44] <%ChoculaUltra> Jin
[1:35:44] <fluke_LKZ> Jin and Soriz
[1:35:58] <OkamiDude15> lunalu is there and if to dudes are fighting and grab eachother she starts drawing up a storm on her canvas
[1:35:58] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I was it on twitter, lunalu totally marks out when there's dudes, but otherwise she's low energy
[1:35:59] <+Mr_Initials> Isnt it the fisherman from the side story?
[1:35:59] <arkv01> oh my god this stage is PACKED with characters
[1:36:03] <Mix_Master_Mao> @Irridium Jin. Katana fighter man who forms the youngest member of the Three Old Men squad. Who sing and pose mightily in fundoshis for the beach festival.
[1:36:06] <arkv01> is everyone in this stage never going to be playable?
[1:36:15] <grenadier42> Soriz is already confirmed for DLC
[1:36:15] <fluke_LKZ> We don't know
[1:36:17] <%Irridium> @Mix_Master_Mao sounds pretty rad
[1:36:19] <fluke_LKZ> But Soriz is DLC
[1:36:23] <nothuzad> arkv01 Soriz si confirmed as second dlc character
[1:36:28] <arkv01> thats gonna be hilarious, sortiz in the fight and sortiz in the BG
[1:36:35] <heartlesshealer> @BallerSwagBro9k All my non-general sex knowledge spawned from me curiously following links on monster/animal-person art sites and then stumbling onto adult stuff
[1:36:39] <%valriot> Naru DLC tho Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:36:41] <fluke_LKZ> He'll just not be in the background
[1:36:46] <%valriot> Thicc Baiken
[1:36:48] <arkv01> no keep him in the BG tho LUL
[1:36:51] <Dragon_Batman> Looked up Soriz, that is a good pick
[1:36:55] <Mix_Master_Mao> brb
[1:36:56] <+Mr_Initials> I think that is the fisherman from the side story in the background with Jin
[1:36:57] <grenadier42> Or maybe they'll be true to the gacha game and let Shiva summon Shiva to fight Shiva
[1:37:06] <heartlesshealer> @BallerSwagBro9k geocities used to be one of those things where lots of people could just make their own web pages

[1:38:18] <Enderou> !uptime
[1:38:19] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 38 minutes
[1:38:20] <+TopTieramisu> "believe in victory" is the tamest opening in an anime fg round i've heard
[1:38:26] <grenadier42> we got GHOST COMBOS
[1:38:34] <Applecannon63> yeah Lancelot is a Leo archetype
[1:38:39] <zenith0111> Leo ResidentSleeper
[1:38:39] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @Irridium no problem, it's the real granblue experience
[1:38:51] <%kapcommunist> zion williamson
[1:38:55] <Spheraph> This the Japanese/HK copy?
[1:38:58] <SvenHolgersson> ICE ICE WAIFU
[1:38:59] <Lamedhos> I never freeze
[1:39:00] <+Mr_Initials> Yes
[1:39:05] <%croxeye> kap, no STOP NO ESPN PLS
[1:39:24] <OkamiDude15> @Spheraph japanese copy so no english
[1:39:25] <TopLeftCenter> @WoolieVersus air up + unique for spidey swing
[1:39:25] <DedlokPM> @Spheraph japanese. hk version has english voice and text
[1:39:34] <arkv01> does the HK version have jp voices?
[1:39:36] <MoonlightP> 'believe in victory' is a reference to gbf, but only the jp version. when you die in a raid you can cheer for the remaining people in it and give them a small buff
[1:39:41] <nothuzad> arkv01 yes
[1:39:47] <heartlesshealer> Bros just fishing in the back
[1:39:48] <arkv01> delicious :P
[1:39:48] <zenith0111> Hold that Reggie
[1:39:48] <nothuzad> @arkv01 you can switch
[1:39:50] <DedlokPM> @arkv01 it has those too
[1:39:55] <MoonlightP> in jp it's 'believe in victory', which they translated to 'believe in yourself' in eng
[1:39:56] <Spheraph> I couldn't tell if all the English text was the English loc or just Japan being Japan XD
[1:40:06] <SvenHolgersson> get em kitty
[1:40:14] <%gatorafan> @moonlightp, Why would I do that? If I lost I'd rather everyone lose with me Kappa
[1:40:15] <grenadier42> B O N I T O
[1:40:16] <zenith0111> Good kitty :e
[1:40:19] <arkv01> grubble has its own dedicated loc team in japan just for the english speaking asian regions
[1:40:21] <faqmachine> It gives reverse beat
[1:40:23] <Quietshun13> ferry seems fun
[1:40:24] <Fujiwara_92> BONITO
[1:40:25] <arkv01> I imagine they would've handled the loc
[1:40:25] <OkamiDude15> her install gives her back beat
[1:40:28] <MoonlightP> you still get the drops if they beat the raid and you're dead
[1:40:33] <Shishi1205> masive badonkadonks on the far right
[1:40:34] <tri3dgE027> SEIYA SEIYA~ SEIYA SEIYAH SEIYAH
[1:40:35] <DedlokPM> @Spheraph names would be in english instead of moonrunes. mogsSmeel
[1:40:36] <PluckyLuck> The thing that I like about this game is the pace. matches are actually engaging to watch as well.
[1:40:39] <SvenHolgersson> FUCKING WHAT
[1:40:39] <MoonlightP> a raid failing sucks for everyone
[1:40:41] <+NotHereToStream> her install allows up to 3 chained normals
[1:40:43] <DeathByPoke7> SHEES THE BAZ
[1:40:43] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> and thus FISH gets even more screentime, bless
[1:40:43] <SvenHolgersson> THATS RAD
[1:40:45] <+IncredibleMeh> So maybe I'm totally nuts, but that fish looks oddly reminiscent of the Devil Sword Sparda

[1:45:18] <Spheraph> Aaanh
[1:45:19] <goose_attack_almanac> Ladivas taunt puts on and off the mask
[1:45:22] <floralkami> @ChoculaUltra REALLY?

[1:45:24] <%Irridium> one of Lavisa's moves lets you puller mask up/down for extra style
[1:45:24] <MoonlightP> belial's horny surpasses metera's
[1:45:28] <Mix_Master_Mao> belial makes metara look like a nun
[1:45:31] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Well, not Anthuria or Belial....
[1:45:32] <+battlebeast67> Going to be honest I'm not calling Ladiva a woman. Cool character otherwise.
[1:45:38] <+PleasantLeech> @dedlokpm oh I see, thank you
[1:45:39] <Reizie_Etherealm> Love is infinite she says
[1:45:40] <%Max_Kaiser> This may have the best shot at getting me in to fighting games, love the setting and aesthetics, and it looks like its not too crazy mechanics-wise and more about fundamentals

[1:48:13] <OkamiDude15> @Spheraph respectful aside from her introduction fate but that was several years ago.
[1:48:13] <MoonlightP> she's beloved by everyone and last year had a really heartwarming event based around her
[1:48:15] <+Mr_Initials> So Draph have a crazy body difference between men and women.
[1:48:16] <+Crimznking> Grea*
[1:48:21] <Spheraph> Alright I like it then
[1:48:24] <MayorRev> DORYAH
[1:48:24] <%ChoculaUltra> best boy Rackam chillin!
[1:48:26] <DedlokPM> @battlebeast67 There is many indications that Ladiva is a female in the actual Granblue Fantasy Mobile game. Everyone calls her she/her and treats her as a woman.
[1:48:32] <Shr3k_SC> hit with the sweet chin music
[1:48:35] <grenadier42> yeah they actually don't use ladiva for any jokes and she's treated respectfully by everyone else in-universe, it's neat
[1:48:36] <Fujiwara_92> GOTTA GET INTO THE zone "Zone"
[1:48:39] <Totaliss> that side eye
[1:48:42] <Mix_Master_Mao> metera still looks hot being kicked in the face.
[1:48:44] <arkv01> did someone say BIDNESS
[1:48:45] <DeathByPoke7> that scaled really poorly
[1:48:48] <EndgameContent> Ladiva is a girl who was born with a burly body so she can protect her friends.
[1:48:54] <Quikanims> that indignant look as she gets kicked
[1:48:57] <MoonlightP> i do think ladiva's got issues since she is kind of baked into okama stereotypes in japan but they've basically tried to stick the landing with her and mostly succeed at it
[1:49:04] <%ChoculaUltra> that sassy hip cock, damn Ladiva
[1:49:05] <grenadier42> basically yeah
[1:49:09] <floralkami> @EndgameContent if that's true lore, imma cry
[1:49:09] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Ladiva is a big mom to a lot of the other characters
[1:49:15] <%AlteisenReiseZ> *sister
[1:49:17] <zenith0111> Ladiva is actually the kind of representation of been waiting on for YEARS
[1:49:18] <BimboBagging> so how do Draphs procriate?
[1:49:21] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> LAdiva is pure
[1:49:27] <Mix_Master_Mao> by fucking presumably bimbo.
[1:49:29] <%ChoculaUltra> that Ladiva event with the Jamil butler costume was v wholesome
[1:49:33] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @BimboBagging carefully
[1:49:33] <GrahamBaxter> I've got to say, for a wrestler Ladiva has FABULOUS hair.
[1:49:37] <7c_nickel> @WoolieVersus Chain those headbutts stomps, you can do like 3 in a row
[1:49:38] <EndgameContent> @floralkami Read her entry on the GBF wiki
[1:49:44] <Quikanims> wait is Ladiva transsexual or what..?
[1:49:47] <floralkami> @GrahamBaxter RIGHT?
[1:49:48] <MoonlightP> trasngender
[1:49:51] <gordieda20> LUL
[1:49:52] <+Mr_Initials> ankle killer
[1:49:52] <Nekros4442> @BimboBagging You dont know how many books were made to depict that
[1:49:54] <+GreatSmasherPunch> You should google what she looked like when she was younger
[1:49:59] <Majereseraph> La diva is french for 'the diva'
[1:49:59] <DedlokPM> @Quikanims Ladiva is a woman.
[1:50:09] <fluke_LKZ> Spanish
[1:50:12] <zenith0111> @quikanims Trans but still has her original body
[1:50:16] <+tearknack> @Quikanims transsexual is a ery dated term that people don't use if they don't want to come of as ify
[1:50:17] <HentaiiKitty69> Lol nice
[1:50:17] <floralkami> @Majereseraph LOL
[1:50:24] <robobby30> Ladiva is a Man becoming girl
[1:50:27] <fluke_LKZ> Her eng name is supposed to be a play on La Diva, because wrestler
[1:50:28] <Fujiwara_92> lativa is a wrestler
[1:50:31] <+wjones0415> ladiva is a transwoman
[1:50:35] <zenith0111> She was offered a wish to turn into a pure woman and she turned it down because she already is one brucegLovebottom
[1:50:38] <Fujiwara_92> *ladiva
[1:50:38] <+Boscuito> oh hey theres rosetta
[1:50:38] <arkv01> ladiva is QUEEN
[1:50:39] <+Boscuito> neat
[1:50:40] <nolifegamin> I think I read that Ladiva keeps her beard since that's a sign of honor where she's from
[1:50:50] <OkamiDude15> @BimboBagging for the most part draph women are your busty with curves under 5 foot kinda girl and on the opposite side of the spectrum draph males are hulking muscular figures that are very tall like vaseraga
[1:50:56] <Nekros4442> @zenith0111 No. She turned it down because she cherishes the body her parents gave her
[1:51:02] <Shr3k_SC> Kreygasm
[1:51:02] <%Max_Kaiser> God this game is so pretty
[1:51:06] <@akuda_bar> v i d e o g a m e s
[1:51:08] <%king_wragles> That's the SWAN!
[1:51:10] <zenith0111> @nekros4442 That too
[1:51:10] <zayasu> she kissed me Kreygasm
[1:51:12] <Mix_Master_Mao> female draphs are like 4 foot something on average. All male draphs are 6 foot plus gigachads
[1:51:14] <grenadier42> draphs are pretty much cow people. thus, the horns
[1:51:22] <%ChoculaUltra> Ladiva turned down the potion because the GBF world would fray at the seams at the sexyness. It's canon.
[1:51:24] <DedlokPM> @nolifegamin she keeps her body because she is proud of the body that her parents gave her but is a woman
[1:51:26] <heartlesshealer> Read up on her event
[1:51:28] <%Calenrow> Calenrow subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[1:51:29] <Lionkevinson> No she kissed me!!!
[1:51:33] <+Doctor_Irony> isnt her armbar projectile invincible?
[1:51:41] <+tearknack> @Nekros4442 that's actually rpetty rad, since trans people who don't have dysphoria is a thing that fiction doesn't really touch on
[1:51:44] <+battlebeast67> @dedlokPM In what way? Curious because what I see is a dude.
[1:51:44] <Majereseraph> did they tried Zeta yet?
[1:51:45] <zenith0111> Ladiva is already pretty sexy brucegAhegao
[1:51:48] <MayorRev> @zenith0111 that's amazing
[1:51:51] <crimsonsaens> Her super armbar is projectile invincible
[1:51:52] <%Irridium> TWOOOOOOOO
[1:51:54] <floralkami> @ChoculaUltra her being as thicc as she is now, i can believe it
[1:51:56] <+Tonku_the_Red> Everyone shut up that kiss was clearly aimed at me!
[1:51:57] <MayorRev> 2.9
[1:52:01] <nothuzad> below 40% is kill
[1:52:03] <Shr3k_SC> If you do kill with it you get the 3 count
[1:52:03] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1224743712657412096?s=19
[1:52:06] <OkamiDude15> @Majereseraph she was ther first character reggie tried
[1:52:06] <%AlteisenReiseZ> If you want the average Male Draph, look up either Vaseraga, Barawa, or Baotorda. For Females, Narmaya, Aliza, or Izmir
[1:52:07] <%Irridium> that butt bump

[1:52:29] <zenith0111> Headlock me Ladoiva brucegAhegao
[1:52:31] <Nekros4442> @AlteisenReiseZ Draphs were litereally designed to hit that Shortstack fetish
[1:52:31] <+PleasantLeech> those grab moves are so good
[1:52:35] <Nekros4442> @AlteisenReiseZ I love it
[1:52:37] <DedlokPM> @battlebeast67 you can read about it here https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1134946346102865925.html
[1:52:38] <Mix_Master_Mao> sturm is for drang.
[1:52:38] <nolifegamin> @DedlokPM oh I know, it's just that there was specific lore about her beard, unless I got it wrong
[1:52:40] <+Mr_Initials> Sturms crazy thou
[1:52:42] <Giothegame> I wonder if they'll play RPG mode to unlock the booty shorts for Metera
[1:52:49] <kingkeldeo31> Has someone played Lowain?
[1:52:50] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @exalt4747 oh sturm gets all the love
[1:52:51] <Spheraph> I am very much open to more confident trans/gender-mixing characters who know who they are and flaunt it.
[1:52:53] <garrulousAuthority> unlock the *what*
[1:52:55] <Applecannon63> Beard is symbol of honor
[1:53:01] <grenadier42> so close!
[1:53:07] <Mix_Master_Mao> also everyone knows that draphs are for secondaries and erunes are fore distinguished men of taste.
[1:53:07] <MoonlightP> ladiva's super can gap close through projectiles
[1:53:08] <arkv01> @Giothegame short answer? No, it's all in japanese
[1:53:08] <+Tonku_the_Red> MY KISS!
[1:53:15] <ZeroTimeLeft> Kreygasm
[1:53:19] <Nekros4442> @Mix_Master_Mao why not both
[1:53:22] <SvenHolgersson> GROSS COOTIES
[1:53:27] <Lionkevinson> Kiss
[1:53:28] <OkamiDude15> @garrulousAuthority beating story mode/rpg mode unlocks zeta and metera's uncensored costumes.
[1:53:28] <Giothegame> They didn't get the HK version??
[1:53:35] <Mix_Master_Mao> @Nekros4442 i have only place in my heart for one granblue waifu and she has animal ears
[1:53:37] <%ChoculaUltra> the best part is that Ladiva is like the crew's bartender therapist. She runs the bar on the ship and people just go to her to pour their feelings out.
[1:53:38] <zenith0111> I'm learning new terms today. Draphs and Erunes?
[1:53:41] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Woolie says one more but all he wants is another kiss from Metera, and YOU KNOW IT
[1:53:42] <xoyv> oh yeah, forgot this was a thing
[1:53:49] <MoonlightP> they're races in granblue
[1:53:51] <grenadier42> @zenith0111 fantasy bullshit races
[1:53:52] <%Irridium> @ChoculaUltra how the hell can Matera's be more uncensored?

[1:54:01] <+battlebeast67> @DedlokPM Dude that's an article of someone's skewed pov.
[1:54:02] <MoonlightP> draphs are the goat people, erunes are cat/dog people
[1:54:03] <zenith0111> @grenadier42 Gotcha
[1:54:08] <kingkeldeo31> I sure hope the uncensored costumes are kept in the NA release
[1:54:10] <+CrazyPhillll> that moaning though....
[1:54:11] <grenadier42> >goat people
[1:54:15] <nothuzad> Irridium she si relativly tame compared to teh character that comes with season pass 2
[1:54:16] <grenadier42> them's cow people my dude
[1:54:16] <+tearknack> @zenith0111 from what people have told me draph are the people with horns, and erunes are the people with cat/dog ears
[1:54:16] <OkamiDude15> @zenith0111 granblue races. humans,draphs,erunes,harvins, and primals
[1:54:16] <GrahamBaxter> I have no knowledge of GranBlue, but I can appreciate how fancy these character designs are.
[1:54:16] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I'd say more Cows then goats....
[1:54:17] <Retolee> WOW
[1:54:19] <%Ecchigun> yooo
[1:54:19] <Vyneci> PogChamp
[1:54:19] <+TeethMuncher> w o w
[1:54:24] <Mix_Master_Mao> Erunes are pretty close to humans, but they're slimmer on average and have animal ears (which vary from horse, to fox, to cat to dog).

[1:54:37] <Lionkevinson> Ikiss
[1:54:39] <grenadier42> with Metera there're ALWAYS buts
[1:54:43] <Pnutz409> she just loves love
[1:54:45] <Mix_Master_Mao> some super special erune bloodlines get tails and they're called Royal Erunes. Their tailes are big and fully.
[1:54:46] <%ChoculaUltra> @Irridium you should see the Summer variants some of the GBF characters have. Makes this Metera look like a nun tbh.
[1:54:49] <GeltonZ> I'm salty that I have to wait for DLC to get another Draph in this game...but at least there's one coming.
[1:54:51] <xoyv> there's plenty of waifu options in GBF
[1:54:51] <gordieda20> SHOT
[1:54:51] <+HakureiIllusion> Losing to Metera just means she brings you home with her

[1:54:57] <+tearknack> oh no the fluff
[1:54:59] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Game needs more Harvins tho
[1:55:02] <Shr3k_SC> I mean there's plenty of options
[1:55:03] <%Irridium> huh
[1:55:08] <cj_art> yaia dlc lets gooo

[1:55:14] <+R_BChe> reminder to wear earbuds on when playing against metera :)
[1:55:15] <MoonlightP> idk how you do harvins that aren't charlotta without making another yoda/gt goku
[1:55:15] <garrulousAuthority> you can't put in a harvin without a hat like Charlotta's
[1:55:16] <Mix_Master_Mao> not a lot of harvins to put in. Sevilbarra could get in and he's great so I'd like him in.
[1:55:17] <%Solidnick18> get bullied
[1:55:17] <%Theycallmenerf> woolieFUN woolieFUN
[1:55:17] <exalt4747> I could honestly see Charlotta being the only Harvint hey put in
[1:55:18] <crimsonsaens> You can't mash to win this match-up, there's no hope for Woolie
[1:55:18] <zenith0111> Yo Metera! How about I get those digits? brucegShades
[1:55:19] <garrulousAuthority> you can't hit them otherwise

[1:55:33] <xoyv> wait, "another draph character" is Narmaya not in?
[1:55:33] <+Qsmash_> for fun :)
[1:55:34] <exalt4747> I don't see her getting in
[1:55:35] <Nekros4442> @exalt4747 I'd be surprised if they dont add Arulumaya as the mage archetype

[1:55:46] <+HakureiIllusion> When's Yuel and Socie though
[1:55:47] <Mix_Master_Mao> yeah Niyon, aru float so they could get in. Niyon would be THE harp rep so she's got a good chance.
[1:55:47] <OkamiDude15> @xoyv she's the first dlc character
[1:55:48] <nothuzad> xoyv narm is first dlc in march
[1:55:50] <%Solidnick18> psa1guy psa1guy psa1guy psa1guy
[1:55:53] <+NotHereToStream> Ladiva's normal skybound art has huge inv frame, so you can pretty much close in on zoners for free
[1:55:53] <GeltonZ> @xoyv Narmaya is DLC
[1:55:54] <CrazyMedicine> LuvCool
[1:55:55] <%ChoculaUltra> @MoonlightP the funny thing is there actually already is a Harvin named Yodarha that's like one of the greatest swordsmen in the GBF verse lmao
[1:55:55] <DedlokPM> @battlebeast67 No. That is a series of tweets that talks about in-game text and events.

[1:57:00] <+Anodynos> stop chatting and get back to hosting grimnir and garuda you scrubs
[1:57:05] <DedlokPM> The only opinion in it is that they actually treat it with respect and not fall into the negative tropes. Only skewed pov is you, @battlebeast67

[1:58:42] <+Crimznking> @alteisenreisez Melissabelle would be cool as a Millia type character
[1:58:44] <+tearknack> @hericknhx getting the hk version is aperently super expensive, its basically sold out
[1:58:44] <MoonlightP> yeah it does
[1:58:44] <+Tonku_the_Red> Yo I head there was a giveaway going on. Did I miss it?
[1:58:46] <exalt4747> How do you run out of digital copies?
[1:58:47] <%Irridium> I managed to get them cards at the last second LUL
[1:58:48] <arkv01> HK servers all burned up in smoke from over downloadan LUL
[1:58:51] <+Tonku_the_Red> heard*

[1:58:55] <+CrystalLakeWasJusASetback> There is an arcade mode

[1:59:02] <MoonlightP> a very extensive story mode even, dragon's crown-esque
[1:59:06] <Shr3k_SC> FABULOUS
[1:59:06] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:59:09] <GrahamBaxter> It's a very sick mask
[1:59:11] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> dark skin ladiva is also good
[1:59:12] <Twin_Hallow> ima just wait for the north america release
[1:59:14] <%croxeye> lets go ProZD
[1:59:14] <arkv01> this game is cross region right? American version can play jp?

[1:59:17] <+freeizone> is that gendo
[1:59:19] <nothuzad> you can unlock more masks in RPG mode :)
[1:59:22] <%Irridium> @arkv01 oh yeah
[1:59:23] <kiso52> is that just anime mortarion?
[1:59:24] <+NotHereToStream> bruh uk has no given release date :(
[1:59:28] <Reizie_Etherealm> "In the face of love, words are not necessary"
[1:59:30] <+battlebeast67> @DedlokPM Nah, it seems like a jokey character that people took too seriously.
[1:59:31] <garrulousAuthority> oh my god that is terrifying
[1:59:34] <zenith0111> ProZD speaks fluent Nipon-nese!
[1:59:35] <MoonlightP> chad walk mode
[1:59:35] <Mix_Master_Mao> damn this just made me realise how huge Vaseraga is, ladiva is smaller.
[1:59:35] <arkv01> get fucked brexit LUL
[1:59:36] <grenadier42> the walk forward
[1:59:39] <Retolee> Euro boys are crying for a date
[1:59:41] <+Qsmash_> monkaS
[1:59:41] <nothuzad> NotHereToStream same goes for the "eventual" PC version V:
[1:59:46] <Fujiwara_92> damn
[1:59:48] <%Solidnick18> no match
[1:59:48] <Shr3k_SC> monkaS
[1:59:50] <+Mr_Initials> wow
[1:59:55] <Dars__> walks menacingly
[2:00:00] <zenith0111> Reggie getting bullied LUL
[2:00:04] <%Solidnick18> YOOO
[2:00:07] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Yeah Vaseraga is a tank
[2:00:09] <+NotHereToStream> @nothuzad hopeful there would be crossplay if PC comes
[2:00:13] <%ChoculaUltra> kinda surprised there's no PC date. I know for sure most gbf players use a pc browser just for the faster refresh functions
[2:00:14] <zenith0111> I SMELL THE FEAR
[2:00:17] <+Mr_Initials> Vas is best at threating
[2:00:18] <GrahamBaxter> GREEN MEANY
[2:00:19] <+battlebeast67> Still like the character's moveset though.
[2:00:22] <arkv01> BATTALION OF FEAR
[2:00:24] <nothuzad> NotHereToStream sadly I do think that hope is set too high :(
[2:00:29] <MoonlightP> they said they want a pc version but they want to ensure the ps4 release is good first
[2:00:29] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[2:00:31] <+balouie> ooh is it not coming for pc
[2:00:34] <Pnutz409> the STRut
[2:00:35] <+freeizone> not pushing any button
[2:00:36] <%ChoculaUltra> ah makes sense
[2:00:36] <fluke_LKZ> Don't fret chat, Vaseraga is one of the good guys.
[2:00:37] <%Solidnick18> Scythe bois Kreygasm
[2:00:41] <zenith0111> Ps4 exclusive?
[2:00:41] <Ner234> The WALK
[2:00:42] <+balouie> crap I dont have a ps4
[2:00:44] <MayorRev> ass
[2:00:44] <+Mr_Initials> yeah but hes bald
[2:00:45] <arkv01> no confirmation on PC yet
[2:00:45] <%Solidnick18> The best
[2:00:46] <Applecannon63> I can't believe ProZd voices this tank
[2:00:47] <Nekros4442> Vaseraga is ALL ABOUT THAT JUSTICE
[2:00:47] <arkv01> but I imagine they would
[2:00:47] <BurdRightsActivist> He's voiced by PROZD PogChamp
[2:00:49] <kiso52> thats fucking anime mortarion hahahaha
[2:00:49] <nothuzad> balouie they basically confirmed it coming to pc but not set dates or anything
[2:00:52] <+tearknack> @balouie i know that feel
[2:00:53] <Mix_Master_Mao> Armoured Chicken is a good boy.
[2:00:55] <+Anodynos> Vaseraga Is a really great guy tho
[2:01:05] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Vaseraga and Zeta are pretty attached to the hip too
[2:01:06] <arkv01> dude one of vaseraga's skills is FEEL NO PAIN
[2:01:14] <+Qsmash_> Vas is the chillest guy in the roster next to Lowain
[2:01:16] <dawnks> is that Alex's dad wtf they have the same animations
[2:01:18] <+NotHereToStream> meh, just bring metera to a vaseraga, shits free
[2:01:18] <zenith0111> I love how developers have been slowly backing away from PC LUL
[2:01:21] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Cause they live in a SOCIETY
[2:01:24] <tri3dgE027> You'd think Vaseraga's a villain with that design, but he is amongst the group of Heroes called The Society LuvSign
[2:01:25] <+balouie> I am trying to not buy consoles and stick with pc and switch gaming
[2:01:29] <%croxeye> at least on the english version Vaseraga is voiced by ProZD, but dunno who the Japanese VA is
[2:01:34] <Pnutz409> Vaseraga has that Hulkster strut
[2:01:34] <%solzan2000> LAdiva is alex+gief in one
[2:01:34] <%Solidnick18> oh come on
[2:01:35] <+tearknack> @balouie same
[2:01:36] <MoonlightP> the society is like, maybe not exactly heroes
[2:01:38] <grenadier42> Dunno that I'd call the Society "heroes"
[2:01:41] <Mix_Master_Mao> @AlteisenReiseZ only place free from living in a SOCIETY... is the MOOOOON
[2:01:48] <zenith0111> @balouie Switch is a console, no?
[2:01:48] <arkv01> vaseraga is that evil looking badass you wanna fuck, and the bonus is he's on the good boy team
[2:01:49] <MoonlightP> but the specific group you know, yeah
[2:01:53] <OkamiDude15> FUCK THE MOON
[2:01:54] <+akaAxi0m> @tri3dgE027 Whenever someone mentions Society I just think of Ouroboros
[2:01:57] <+HakureiIllusion> Morally ambiguous but the main squad of Vaseraga/Bea/Zeta/Eustace are pretty heroic
[2:01:57] <Pnutz409> reachhh
[2:02:00] <Mix_Master_Mao> FUCK the MOON
[2:02:03] <%Irridium> GranBlue lives in a Society
[2:02:03] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @croxeye Fumiko Takahashi, voices Gendo Ikari and Akainu
[2:02:04] <nothuzad> zenith0111 nah stuff si still releasing on pc but publisher set themselfs up to double dip or because they only set up the porting after the game releases
[2:02:05] <garrulousAuthority> when's Ilse ArcSys
[2:02:07] <arkv01> shhh the society thing is spoilers you fucks
[2:02:07] <ChoculaUltra> they're like...the Foxhound of the GBF verse in a way? They do a lot of....wet work.
[2:02:10] <alrobot2014> @akaAxi0m thank god i'm not the only one
[2:02:10] <faqmachine> Zeta, Bea, Vas, Ilsa and Eustace are heroes, maybe not the rest though
[2:02:11] <tri3dgE027> Well more of the more heroic and leaning on the good one members of The Society, along with Zeta and Beatrice
[2:02:15] <Mix_Master_Mao> @garrulousAuthority based ilsa fan
[2:02:17] <+tearknack> know when i here society i jsut think of Potemkins new theme
[2:02:19] <+balouie> yeah switch has become my go to console so no more ps or xbox
[2:02:29] <Mix_Master_Mao> also who #pommerngang here.
[2:02:30] <MoonlightP> idk it's pretty clear from the get go the arrangement is p shady
[2:02:36] <GrahamBaxter> Ladiva: When the Heavy plays Rushdown
[2:02:40] <yirawk> I hope the Japanese voices end up default for tournaments, after playing the original for 4 years it feels wrong hearing these different voices
[2:02:41] <+balouie> though I do have game pass since its to good of a deal to pass up
[2:02:43] <+tearknack> in society, in society
[2:02:44] <zenith0111> @nothuzad Yeah PC is a great port console
[2:02:45] <+akaAxi0m> @alrobot2014 As much Trails as I've played in the past few months (including CS4) I'd be hard pressed not to associate literally anything with Trails now.
[2:02:45] <%AlteisenReiseZ> HEEEEDORAW
[2:02:52] <faqmachine> @Mix_Master_Mao Redeemed Pommern gang
[2:02:53] <@akuda_bar> we live in a sobriety
[2:02:55] <%Reverend_Roscoe> how is the game so far?
[2:02:56] <%solzan2000> the eng dub is fine imo
[2:03:08] <Mix_Master_Mao> @faqmachine Pommern SSR gang
[2:03:09] <MoonlightP> the eng dub is ok but some character seem badly directed
[2:03:11] <garrulousAuthority> English Vyrn is a problem
[2:03:13] <Shr3k_SC> bullshit
[2:03:15] <Shr3k_SC> loooool
[2:03:20] <grenadier42> yeah the dub's not half bad. Belial seemed fine from what I heard and he's all I cared about
[2:03:22] <+TeethMuncher> X
[2:03:22] <Fujiwara_92> X
[2:03:22] <%Irridium> One thing I notices when playing online is that if you have jp voices set and the other person has english, their character speaks in English. Kind of neat.
[2:03:23] <MoonlightP> like percival does not convey the imperious royal thing jp percy does at all
[2:03:23] <OkamiDude15> percival dub kinda weak
[2:03:24] <+NarcissistCactus> ❌
[2:03:26] <DeathByPoke7> X
[2:03:28] <zenith0111> X
[2:03:28] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Woolie is actually pretty good with Vaseraga, must be because of the colors
[2:03:28] <Twin_Hallow> LUL
[2:03:29] <+HostilePoundcakes> X
[2:03:32] <%FuqBoiSlim> X
[2:03:33] <neVan0> zeta dub is Weird
[2:03:33] <Retolee> dubs good for lowaine, not so much the rest
[2:03:34] <Mix_Master_Mao> @solzan2000 it's not about whether it's good or bad. Gacha players been with the jap VA for years. It'll never be the same.
[2:03:35] <Huntercd> x
[2:03:36] <+Anodynos> Zeta and Metera English dub is not good for me
[2:03:38] <am_omega> Sick GBVS.
[2:03:41] <SvenHolgersson> Vyrn is a problem in gehneral cuz I hate him
[2:03:44] <+Anodynos> Percival is ight
[2:03:45] <alrobot2014> @akaAxi0m i played the entire series not including cs4 over the past year,, its so hard not having it on the brain
[2:03:49] <%solzan2000> you have options lol
[2:03:53] <FunkyStreams> the character is the two coolest characters So Cal combined with a purple and green color format.
[2:03:57] <%ChoculaUltra> Vyrn is a sinking abyss of pure evil.
[2:03:58] <+NotHereToStream> Kana yooo
[2:04:04] <%wujak> not anymore. that was only in the beta
[2:04:05] <nothuzad> Anodynos Percival is good talking - but the battle shouts soudn super muted and not poewerful
[2:04:09] <+Crimznking> @svenholgersson Wait till Swole Vyrn
[2:04:09] <%solzan2000> and tournys 99% of the time are gonna JP anyway lol
[2:04:10] <am_omega> Oh the dub? Lowain is great. Just in everything.
[2:04:13] <DontExpectAnythingDude> that was changed right.
[2:04:14] <floralkami> Ooh, okay that's a fair trade off
[2:04:15] <crimsonsaens> They got rid of that punishment
[2:04:16] <%Max_Kaiser> Zeta looks cool
[2:04:18] <grenadier42> Any time Vyrn opens his stupid lizard mouth, one of the other characters should IMMEDIATELY tell him to shut the fuck up
[2:04:20] <+akaAxi0m> @alrobot2014 Same, starting in October, including Zero and Ao and CS4 and just I NEED MORE
[2:04:26] <Allegrow> Charlotta sounds super weird in the EN dub
[2:04:26] <arkv01> the DLC characters are hype AF, can't wait for macho vyrn in April LUL
[2:04:31] <SvenHolgersson> @Crimznking Imma have to pass LUL
[2:04:33] <%ChoculaUltra> how's Zeta
[2:04:38] <%Solidnick18> vaseraga
[2:04:39] <tri3dgE027> Can't wait for Soriz in the DLC
[2:04:40] <garrulousAuthority> i'M nOt A LiZaRd @grenadier42
[2:04:40] <+PleasantLeech> what are they playing later?
[2:04:41] <grenadier42> ZETA IS COOL
[2:04:42] <arkv01> zeta's almost thot tier but she's great
[2:04:43] <Fujiwara_92> nah, we doom later keep going PogChamp
[2:04:43] <+freeizone> lancea ResidentSleeper
[2:04:48] <xoyv> ...god, looking at this, all i can think of is like, "you know what'd be really dumb? april fools vee-kun character"
[2:04:48] <OkamiDude15> soriz gang, we reppin THE BOYS
[2:04:49] <alrobot2014> @akaAxi0m and then we've got Hajimari coming eventually as well
[2:04:50] <grenadier42> she has LASER SPAR
[2:04:52] <grenadier42> spear.
[2:04:54] <Mix_Master_Mao> Use red/gold/black colour on zeta cowards!
[2:04:55] <Allegrow> Metera is omega thot
[2:04:56] <MoonlightP> vaseraga is like, not great imo. so if your objective is winning then i woild not go with vaseraga
[2:04:56] <Fujiwara_92> SO ZETA SLOW
[2:04:57] <Pnutz409> Zetaaa
[2:04:57] <Dragon_Batman> MAybe Vas and second Ice boy for problems
[2:05:01] <GrahamBaxter> I have questions about the effectiveness of that armour
[2:05:02] <hericknhx> chads only pick Ladiva Kappa
[2:05:05] <arkv01> I mean they've gone through all the characters and they're not going arcade or story mode cause this is japanese
[2:05:08] <floralkami> More like a thermal spear
[2:05:10] <+Anodynos> @nothuzad I haven't got to hear everything yet so youre probably right, I only heard the ults
[2:05:14] <Quietshun13> buff vyrn as a character would be legit amazing
[2:05:15] <+NotHereToStream> man when will type moon quit being cowards and make a fate fg
[2:05:16] <+akaAxi0m> @alrobot2014 oh yea as soon as there's a translation spreadsheet/overlay for it, I'm playin it.
[2:05:18] <arkv01> they'll cover this again and do the modes when american version is out I think
[2:05:19] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Back to the first matchup
[2:05:19] <zenith0111> Vas can whiff almost point blank
[2:05:22] <grenadier42> who needs effective armor when you have weird moon spear
[2:05:25] <Mix_Master_Mao> macho vee but playable only on april 1st
[2:05:25] <+TeethMuncher> @GrahamBaxter you aim for boobs, but get speared
[2:05:27] <am_omega> @WoolieVersus Did you know all of Lowain's wins are non canon. The endings are him just going "Yo and then I would totally do this and win"
[2:05:31] <Pnutz409> This is Spooky's main
[2:05:34] <+battlebeast67> I just disagree with Ladiva being trans.
[2:05:36] <%Irridium> @NotHereToStream They've done that a few times they're ass LUL
[2:05:37] <garrulousAuthority> @NotHereToStream don't make me excited
[2:05:41] <tri3dgE027> Zeta has the Shovel-Shell input and can also be repeated rooAww
[2:05:42] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @NotHereToStream What are you talking about, we already have Melty Blood :)
[2:05:42] <MoonlightP> you can 'disagree' or not
[2:05:47] <MoonlightP> it's literally in the game
[2:05:49] <zenith0111> @am_omega Omg that's the best thing evee
[2:05:50] <OkamiDude15> @battlebeast67 thats the lore no changing it
[2:05:53] <+NarcissistCactus> fate unlimited codes is sick
[2:05:57] <grenadier42> @battlebeast67 holy shit nobody cares
[2:05:58] <arkv01> and that's why Lowain is the spokesman of all the GBF offline events, GBF isn't real LUL
[2:05:59] <Fujiwara_92> LUL
[2:06:00] <faqmachine> @battlebeast67 Can't disagree with something that's objectively true
[2:06:02] <floralkami> @battlebeast67 sounds like a coward disagreeing with reality
[2:06:02] <garrulousAuthority> Unlimited Codes is broken
[2:06:10] <Pnutz409> gucci gang
[2:06:10] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:06:11] <hericknhx> @battlebeast67 it's not that deep bruh 4head
[2:06:13] <+NotHereToStream> listen, just go to arcsys and your issue is solved, type moon has fuck you money
[2:06:19] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Fate Unlimited Combos
[2:06:21] <Applecannon63> you can disagree are don't care and silence
[2:06:22] <DontExpectAnythingDude> Fate Unlimited Codes Kappa
[2:06:31] <garrulousAuthority> I know they have fuck you money I've whaled plenty
[2:06:38] <nothuzad> NotHereToStream ? Cygames has unlimited money and the ycould hav edone that all and they didnt V:
[2:06:39] <Mix_Master_Mao> POGO
[2:06:43] <OkamiDude15> whens F.U.C.C. woolie?!
[2:06:46] <Pnutz409> head stompu
[2:06:48] <am_omega> @battlebeast67 No she is legit trans. She "yes she" does not want to change her body because she loves the one her parents gave her.
[2:06:53] <Arkhamman367> Is this the EVO?
[2:06:56] <arkv01> arcsys needs to talk to Riot about using their brand new routing network built from ground up
[2:06:58] <Fujiwara_92> monkaS
[2:07:00] <SvenHolgersson> Not if you jump into a fireball there Reg
[2:07:03] <%ChoculaUltra> yes, this is the EVO
[2:07:09] <+mccf> this is EVO GF
[2:07:09] <+NotHereToStream> @nothuzad well cygames are cowards then SwiftRage
[2:07:11] <yirawk> The problem with type moon is they don't like spending money, every game they do that isn't directly made by them is contracted out to the lowest bidder
[2:07:18] <zenith0111> Ladiva is actually the representation I've been waiting on FOREVER
[2:07:19] <arkv01> this EVO is going to be max weeb and I am gonna Kreygasm
[2:07:27] <garrulousAuthority> maybe Studio BB is going to be the ones to save us
[2:07:30] <SvenHolgersson> Zeta looks fucking rad as hell
[2:07:33] <zenith0111> A real Trans Character with Personality
[2:07:36] <garrulousAuthority> (I have no goddamn clue what they're producing)
[2:07:40] <Fujiwara_92> Zeta looking cool as heck
[2:07:43] <+battlebeast67> @am_omega Then the argument can be made then.
[2:07:43] <Allegrow> Ladiva is the best mom
[2:07:45] <grenadier42> HARD READS
[2:07:45] <Pnutz409> wow
[2:07:46] <Fujiwara_92> LUl
[2:07:46] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Man, can Cygames make more figures
[2:07:47] <+jdiosama> ladiva is trans?
[2:07:47] <%Irridium> but doesn't type-moon have like stupid money? Why not spend some to make a good game, fighting or otherwise. I'll be real I'd buy an actual game from them.
[2:07:48] <%ChoculaUltra> reminder that FGO hasn't collabed with ANY franchises outside of Type-Moon shit and it's still in the top 3 earning gachas of all time
[2:07:48] <Fujiwara_92> LUL
[2:07:52] <Arkhamman367> Marvel 2 is such a weeb game Kappa
[2:07:53] <%Solidnick18> Ok that was good
[2:07:55] <am_omega> What argument?
[2:07:56] <OkamiDude15> @jdiosama yup
[2:07:58] <crimsonsaens> IDK if I want to play Vaseraga or Zeta
[2:08:00] <nothuzad> arkv01 also we will have maybe around 6 more characters up to EVO for GB VS

[2:08:31] <Arkhamman367> The reads
[2:08:33] <%croxeye> good finish
[2:08:33] <+NarcissistCactus> this red name is gormless 😤
[2:08:33] <hericknhx> is not that deep chat 4Head
[2:08:36] <Idon__> I thought the game was in English by now?
[2:08:40] <heartlesshealer> Anyone still stuck on Ladiva just read the wiki
[2:08:40] <floralkami> @battlebeast67 bruh, do you argue about the world being flat?
[2:08:41] <%Irridium> @Tommyrats really? Sick.
[2:08:44] <+battlebeast67> Zeta has Talbain's beast cannon.
[2:08:47] <OkamiDude15> narm mirrors gonna super real
[2:08:48] <SvenHolgersson> It is Woolie just has the other version
[2:08:48] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @nothuzad that dark zeta lean tho
[2:08:49] <@akuda_bar> @Idon__ the Taiwanese version, the japanese version they're playing on is JP only
[2:08:49] <%solzan2000> the hk version is in english
[2:08:50] <nothuzad> Idon__ HK version not on jp version
[2:08:52] <am_omega> There is no argument because in the gacha game she says she is trans.
[2:08:54] <Idon__> Ahhh damn that sucks
[2:08:57] <tri3dgE027> For some odd-reason Woolie bought the JP version instead of HK @Idon__
[2:09:00] <@akuda_bar> @am_omega enough
[2:09:03] <nothuzad> KosOrSomeSayKosm_ I meant more because of the amout of porn of it V:
[2:09:04] <am_omega> Like just read her character story.
[2:09:05] <arkv01> the HK digital version sold out, the HK PSN servers all burn out LUL
[2:09:08] <AzureFlame98> It was pretty much a yearly thing on the PS2
[2:09:14] <@akuda_bar> @am_omega we're moving on, I said enough.
[2:09:18] <Idon__> how does a digital game sell out NotLikeThis
[2:09:20] <Pnutz409> Lancelot is rekka right?
[2:09:20] <zenith0111> Mods might need to .... you know atpLaw brucegShades
[2:09:26] <+Mr_Initials> the mobile game is in english but not on the play store
[2:09:30] <Fujiwara_92> get fucked reggie LUL
[2:09:30] <+battlebeast67> @floralkami What the world not's flat holy shit.
[2:09:31] <%ChoculaUltra> its that getting an HK PSN card to actually have currency to buy the game is a bit hard rn. Most retailers are sold out and the only bet is resale.
[2:09:33] <+NarcissistCactus> get some aris mods in here
[2:09:34] <Fujiwara_92> oh boi
[2:09:34] <am_omega> Yeah its fine.

[2:09:55] <OkamiDude15> @Idon__ not so much the digital sold out but cards to get the funds ran out online
[2:09:55] <Allegrow> I seriously hope that Corntato gets in the game
[2:09:57] <%ChoculaUltra> you can't just slap your regular old paypal account onto an HK PSN account, you'd need a HK paypal account or card.
[2:09:58] <+CounterBeard> have the himbros made an appearance yet?
[2:10:00] <+jdiosama> who's best girl in this game?
[2:10:03] <+battlebeast67> But hey like I said character's still cool though.

[2:13:37] <Quietshun13> fgo gang
[2:13:38] <%ChoculaUltra> Granblue is very different from most gachas I'll tell ya hwhat. It's more of an mmo tbh.
[2:13:38] <Mix_Master_Mao> there's too many fucking characters in GBF they could put anyone in man.
[2:13:39] <+Canorius> play gbf gatcha
[2:13:42] <Dragon_Batman> Probably just Cosmetic
[2:13:42] <GrahamBaxter> Oh hey, I didn't notice Kirby there before. Nice
[2:13:43] <kuitlapiltsontli> I left FGO for Granblue a long time ago
[2:13:47] <nothuzad> its just skins
[2:13:47] <Mix_Master_Mao> yes grabble is singleplayer mmo.
[2:13:50] <kuitlapiltsontli> Never regreted it
[2:13:54] <am_omega> @WoolieVersus In RPG mode it changes stats, other than that its cosmetic.
[2:13:55] <OldManDeckardCain> there's a weapon skin that looks like that animal that's with gran
[2:13:56] <Spheraph> The English version of GBF isn't a patch. It's just an official English localization
[2:13:58] <Dragon_Batman> Considering Ladiva's mask can be switched
[2:14:08] <hntronium> I never got into grabble and don't regret it
[2:14:10] <arkv01> grubble has atrocious grind for people who are neurotic about grinding (AKA Minh_
[2:14:13] <+ssulcer> Knuckles from Knuckles and Woolie
[2:14:16] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @primarch_lupercal the anime is pretty much glorified a commercial, very much watered down compared to the game
[2:14:19] <OkamiDude15> @primarch_lupercal its alright from what ive heard. has 2 seasons and covers the first handfull of chapters of the story and has an ova with the female protag who has 5 star characters
[2:14:19] <+NarcissistCactus> oh no
[2:14:22] <Tucker0603> yes
[2:14:24] <grenadier42> the gacha game is... antiquated
[2:14:24] <arkv01> do NOT WATCH THE ANIME
[2:14:25] <%Irridium> there's an anime?
[2:14:25] <heartlesshealer> Multimedia
[2:14:25] <Thalchampz> there is an anime too
[2:14:25] <Nekros4442> There was an anime. But it was kinda meh
[2:14:26] <DaKnightWarrior> yes
[2:14:27] <arkv01> its fuckin terrible
[2:14:27] <Dragon_Batman> Cygames going in
[2:14:28] <Khorneflakes_> They mad eone recently
[2:14:28] <hericknhx> it's on Netflix
[2:14:29] <nothuzad> there is an aime
[2:14:30] <+wolfsy7> anime isnt that good
[2:14:30] <+glassesaregod> Don't watch the anime. It'a trash
[2:14:31] <+NecDW4> @woolie tehh anime has a Chie
[2:14:33] <MayorRev> Doomguy is not trapped in hell with demons, the demons are trapped in hell with Doomguy
[2:14:33] <Spheraph> Granblue has nice characters but I cannot stomach playing it. It's disappointing.
[2:14:34] <+pectusumbra> I think there's multiple seasons of anime?
[2:14:34] <nothuzad> cygames has its own anime studio
[2:14:34] <jorniev> YO THE ENGLISH INTROS CAME OUT
[2:14:35] <alrobot2014> there is an anime but it put me to sleep
[2:14:35] <Klefth> It's a M O N E Y game
[2:14:36] <%Irridium> oh it's awful, that's why I haven't heard about it LUL
[2:14:37] <+RaddestMage> Season 1 of the anime isn't great
[2:14:38] <Retolee> anime is fine
[2:14:40] <+Javaa01> You don't get Cygames money without COMPLETE market saturation
[2:14:40] <+GarbageNirvana> They're making it a whole thing
[2:14:40] <+NotHereToStream> which studio is animating the series?
[2:14:41] <+Crimznking> Anime is really bad
[2:14:43] <%Max_Kaiser> Multimedia franchise
[2:14:44] <Nekros4442> Rofl....Bofuri
[2:14:45] <heartlesshealer> That's a fun manga
[2:14:46] <%ChoculaUltra> shoutouts to the GBF team for localizing the game alongside the JP version. All updates are simulataneous since the translation is done in house.
[2:14:47] <scrumbotime> Granblue has tons of MUSIC too, they got that final fantasy composer shit goin' on
[2:14:48] <am_omega> Yep two season of the anime. I hear Season 1 is shit though. Season 2 is decent from what I hear.
[2:14:49] <arkv01> the ONLY good episode is the djeeta OVAs, would you lookit that
[2:14:49] <%Prevot> LUL
[2:14:51] <+NotHereToStream> nothing can ever beat the ufotable treatment

[2:15:03] <Nekros4442> It's a snug wat ch

[2:15:11] <ryuguitarfreak> Anime looks like trash fun, just like everything related Granblue
[2:15:11] <+tearknack> @WoolieVersus afaik this one is literally just about an MMO
[2:15:12] <NickHatesSnow> dungeon meshi is godlike
[2:15:12] <%ChoculaUltra> Nobuo Uematsu is actually a summon in GBF too, its great.
[2:15:13] <Pnutz409> Isekai

[2:15:23] <%Irridium> only isekai I'll look at is the one with Iori
[2:15:25] <+pectusumbra> Bofuri is cute. It's about an airhead girl that becomes A WALL
[2:15:25] <Pnutz409> Granblue Fantasy isn't Isekai!
[2:15:28] <NickHatesSnow> the slime one is decent
[2:15:29] <OBS_VinnieK> Defense girl is actually really good

[2:15:38] <nothuzad> but 90% of isekai is trash
[2:15:39] <+PenmanLupine> Is it ok to pick up girls isn't an Isekai. neither is Granblue
[2:15:41] <Pnutz409> Gran is friggen cool
[2:15:43] <hntronium> Not visual novels
[2:15:43] <ryuguitarfreak> Isekai DansGame
[2:15:44] <%croxeye> John Carter of Mars, The original Isekai
[2:15:45] <ravencloak13> Woolie, what if I say there is a fighting game isekai?
[2:15:45] <floralkami> Woolie it isn't isekai, it's a legit MMO
[2:15:46] <hntronium> Light novels
[2:15:49] <primarch_lupercal> nah its all light novels
[2:15:50] <CrazyMedicine> Granblue is normal fantasy
[2:15:52] <am_omega> Well, people get Isekai'd in the GB world.
[2:15:53] <OkamiDude15> the isekai boom is was super real like the moe-blob boom
[2:15:55] <SilentGaming49> Reincarnated as an AutoBlow with Max Stats, My Adventure in Another Wolrd
[2:15:55] <Khorneflakes_> ususally there is a gimmick
[2:15:58] <OBS_VinnieK> I would say Bonfuni is just a girl playing an MMO
[2:16:01] <+Crimznking> Blame Sword World Woolie
[2:16:05] <Pnutz409> Prodigies
[2:16:08] <CrazyMedicine> Slime is a great one
[2:16:12] <arkv01> @SilentGaming49 I'd defend that
[2:16:12] <am_omega> Like Ryu, Haohmaru, Jehuty, Lelouch, P5 Joker.
[2:16:12] <heartlesshealer> Picking up Girls is a raw fantasy, not Isekai
[2:16:13] <Klefth> Re: Zero is sick, though
[2:16:15] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> why do you even need other isekai when konosuba exists
[2:16:17] <jorniev> LOWAIN has a move called CATCH EM SLIPPING in english
[2:16:17] <Applecannon63> what if Etrnal Gran or Djeeta?
[2:16:19] <hntronium> isemo
[2:16:20] <+PleasantLeech> never ending story is a dang isekai
[2:16:21] <Khorneflakes_> They hit the same beats
[2:16:21] <+McSoliace> honestly isekai is a genre at this point
[2:16:21] <heartlesshealer> don't lump that in
[2:16:22] <+coastghost64> .Hack was cool tho
[2:16:23] <itsgutsnotgatsu> woolie watch Ping Pong you coward
[2:16:25] <nothuzad> isekai just means transported to another world
[2:16:29] <%ChoculaUltra> there's so many video game isekais and yet the .hack series has remained dead since the mid 00s. FeelsBadMan
[2:16:33] <%Irridium> @jorniev don't forget "Awesome Sauce"
[2:16:33] <+NYCrownlessKing> dot hack is the true isekai @WoolieVersus
[2:16:35] <xoyv> @WoolieVersus have you seen the live action dragonquest parody? Yuusha Yoshihiko To Maou No Shiro
[2:16:43] <nothuzad> NYCrownlessKing digimon :)
[2:16:44] <+Polter_ge1st> Did I miss the sex?
[2:16:45] <floralkami> But isekai is a different genre, tho......
[2:16:48] <scrumbotime> Vasaraga
[2:16:49] <zayasu> KappaPride
[2:16:49] <Pnutz409> hahaha
[2:16:50] <neVan0> LOL
[2:16:50] <Khorneflakes_> LUL
[2:16:50] <Applecannon63> DIGIMON Is an Isekai
[2:16:52] <%Solidnick18> same
[2:16:53] <Sol_Install> LUL
[2:16:54] <arkv01> ok fair, this game does have husband mateiral
[2:16:54] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> YEYYEYE
[2:16:55] <DaKnightWarrior> atpGood
[2:16:56] <%croxeye> we already know what the Woolie bait is man cmon
[2:17:01] <arkv01> vaseraga is DADDY
[2:17:01] <Nekros4442> Inuyasha is an Isekai....
[2:17:03] <ryuguitarfreak> But Zeta is life though
[2:17:05] <Mix_Master_Mao> are there even tomboys in granblue fantasy? I only care about Ilsa I don't think about other women.
[2:17:06] <Pnutz409> Not enoug midriff abs
[2:17:07] <%yeknomlive> is reboot an isekai
[2:17:07] <+MisterRockett> Isn't Vas trans?
[2:17:07] <%Solidnick18> vaseraga is a stud
[2:17:08] <%Irridium> King Kong is an Isekai
[2:17:08] <%FuqBoiSlim> More Hazubandos than Waifus NotLikeThis
[2:17:09] <am_omega> Fantasy =/= isekai.
[2:17:10] <+RaddestMage> You just haven't seen the REAL waifus
[2:17:13] <+Taglog7> Not enough PUNCH
[2:17:14] <DedlokPM> Escaflown is an Isekai
[2:17:14] <+tearknack> @Nekros4442 is time travel isekai though?
[2:17:15] <heartlesshealer> Inuyasha is more time travel
[2:17:15] <DingusMcBaseball> yggdrasil
[2:17:16] <+GarbageNirvana> Does Granblue have any short-haired punchgirls?
[2:17:18] <Nekros4442> Reboot could be an Isekai
[2:17:18] <+Canorius> there are some choice husbands in gbf
[2:17:18] <+primax104> Sh
[2:17:18] <arkv01> if you have to think you're already scythe'd
[2:17:22] <+MisterRockett> Pretty sure Vasaraga is trans.
[2:17:22] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Surprisingly granblue is very balanced in the waifu-husbando department
[2:17:22] <kuitlapiltsontli> Woolie check out Geisenborger from Granblue, he is basically a Jojo character
[2:17:24] <GeltonZ> @Mix_Master_Mao Yes, plenty. Especially amongst Draphs.
[2:17:25] <+NotHereToStream> get your lore from those thin books LUL
[2:17:25] <nothuzad> Inuyasha is time travel
[2:17:25] <OkamiDude15> @MisterRockett naw vas is cis but ladiva is trans
[2:17:27] <arkv01> NO ONE LIKES GRAN DansGame
[2:17:31] <+MisterRockett> Ah
[2:17:32] <ryuguitarfreak> Zeta and Katalina are awesome
[2:17:32] <%solzan2000> gran looks basic asf
[2:17:33] <projecthazoid> Does InuYasha count as an isekai? :U
[2:17:34] <%Valask> Inuyasha is perfection
[2:17:36] <GeltonZ> NEEDS. MORE. DRAPH GIRLS.
[2:17:36] <+tearknack> @Nekros4442 cause in that case doctor who is an isekai
[2:17:37] <floralkami> Yeah, there isn't any amazon or thicc muscle girls, and i agree
[2:17:37] <%jiggy_snipe> does anyone like Gran?
[2:17:39] <%solzan2000> but I play Kat so lol
[2:17:40] <GeltonZ> @projecthazoid Yes
[2:17:40] <+primax104> Katalina maaaaannnnnn
[2:17:42] <Dars__> grab doesnt have his cooler class designs in this game
[2:17:42] <nothuzad> projecthazoid no
[2:17:45] <CalderGaming> djeeta has AT LEAST one punchgirl outfit doesn't she?
[2:17:46] <+HostilePoundcakes> Gran looks so boring
[2:17:46] <arkv01> gran is a twink purely there for ero doujins
[2:17:46] <%FuqBoiSlim> No Almeida no buy
[2:17:46] <Pnutz409> Even Gran doesn't like Gran
[2:17:46] <+Taglog7> Not Enough short hair
[2:17:48] <Dars__> gran*
[2:17:48] <Applecannon63> Alter Ego Gran tho
[2:17:48] <ravencloak13> Ilsa isn't a tomboy, the couple of tomboys are say Cordelia, Ange and... maybe Aliza?
[2:17:52] <Nekros4442> @tearknack I'm all for it. Lets just make Isekai everything
[2:17:52] <%ComfyRice> Are going to switch to the North American Versions of GBV wgen it somes out?
[2:17:53] <OkamiDude15> "define an action game"
[2:17:54] <+MisterRockett> My bad I meant Ladiva
[2:17:55] <heartlesshealer> Isekai, Tensei, Fantasy, and MMO
[2:17:59] <jorniev> WHAT ABOUT RE ZERO
[2:17:59] <Nekros4442> @tearknack fuck it lol
[2:17:59] <+Mr_Initials> Farrah
[2:18:00] <%Solidnick18> need more muscle wifes
[2:18:00] <arkv01> technically djeeta has like 5 punchgirl outfits
[2:18:06] <@akuda_bar> @MisterRockett yeah i was like "...what"
[2:18:13] <ravencloak13> Farrah isn't she just has short hair.
[2:18:15] <Mix_Master_Mao> I guess musclegirl archetype is actually one of the few things missing from GBF
[2:18:24] <Mix_Master_Mao> come to think of it
[2:18:24] <CalderGaming> there's a huge punchgirl in Arknights but that's 1) gacha and 2) tower defense
[2:18:24] <arkv01> oh my NEWSFLAS REGGIE DOESN'T LIKE ANIME D:
[2:18:32] <nothuzad> Mix_Master_Mao there are punch girls though
[2:18:33] <jorniev> is there a punch girl in granblue?
[2:18:33] <%jiggy_snipe> Woolie didn't want to makle the HK account
[2:18:36] <DedlokPM> @Mix_Master_Mao Ladiva is a muscle girl tho. rooThink
[2:18:41] <CalderGaming> ^
[2:18:42] <%Irridium> oh well that explains it
[2:18:42] <nothuzad> Mix_Master_Mao but yes less muscle
[2:18:44] <ravencloak13> There are several punch girls
[2:18:44] <+CrystalLakeWasJusASetback> Hallessena in the first DLC or riot.
[2:18:46] <+Crimznking> @mix_master_mao Muscle girl yeas, punch girl no
[2:18:51] <hntronium> You put money in it?
[2:18:54] <hntronium> Oh no
[2:18:57] <@akuda_bar> @DedlokPM you already got timed out, don't start again
[2:18:57] <OkamiDude15> @jorniev there are several. aliza for instance
[2:18:58] <floralkami> Wouldn't say they are the hottest thing right now with the viewers, but it's definitely pushed
[2:19:00] <hntronium> They've got him already
[2:19:02] <arkv01> duh, of course woolie would have money in his japanese PSN
[2:19:05] <Mix_Master_Mao> yeah aliza isn't big and stronk. You'd have to have an erune, human or primal for that build.
[2:19:06] <jorniev> wich is the best punch girl in gran blue
[2:19:06] <Nekros4442> Aliza is a kick girl
[2:19:12] <am_omega> @WoolieVersus Are you going to check out Lowain wins? Its hilarious.
[2:19:13] <OkamiDude15> true
[2:19:18] <FuqBoiSlim> No Almeida no buy no Almedia (Summer) no buy
[2:19:21] <ravencloak13> They ain;t going to bring Hallessena! We already have Loli Akuma recking people and Lowain beat people cause no one knows how to spot dodge
[2:19:29] <arkv01> Sen is confirmed DLC right? "No" is not an acceptable answer
[2:19:31] <%ComfyRice> ARCANA LOVE MAX #
[2:19:33] <%ChoculaUltra> aren't all draph females like canonically 4 feet tall?
[2:19:38] <Applecannon63> Gran has a Ryu skin
[2:19:40] <Mix_Master_Mao> 4-5 yes
[2:19:41] <+vaderxyz1970> Wollie sell me MeltyBlood
[2:19:45] <ravencloak13> More around 3 to 4 ft
[2:19:45] <Reizie_Etherealm> It's fine to hate gacha but don't hate the thing that is trying to be more than that by branching out just because it started as gacha
[2:19:45] <nothuzad> arkv01 no :V
[2:19:49] <OkamiDude15> @jorniev surf that granblue wiki and see which you like
[2:19:51] <+NotHereToStream> No airdashes,
[2:19:52] <+tearknack> street fighter looks like an anime
[2:19:54] <%chronoxgp> I've still never beaten arcana love max once
[2:19:56] <arkv01> @nothuzad D:
[2:19:57] <Mariakko> But it looks like anime
[2:20:01] <+Crimznking> @choculaultra 4 ft and ultra stacked
[2:20:05] <Nekros4442> @ChoculaUltra Yes. Draphs as a race were designed to appeal to the height difference fetish.....both ways
[2:20:08] <+tearknack> street fighter is an anime fighter imo
[2:20:11] <DedlokPM> @akuda_bar I got timed out for calling someone out. Plus i am just telling actual in-game lore facts about a character
[2:20:12] <+NotHereToStream> but there are runs instead of set dashes
[2:20:12] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:20:13] <DeathByPoke7> is marvel anime
[2:20:18] <%gatorafan> Anime in the fgc is weird. daedra1DerpyTibs
[2:20:18] <nothuzad> street fighter is 100% anime jsut not air dashing
[2:20:20] <+R_BChe> mahvel anime
[2:20:25] <Dars__> cygames started out gacha games so they could fund actual games
[2:20:28] <@akuda_bar> @DedlokPM I'm the mod, why are you telling me what you got timed out for
[2:20:30] <OkamiDude15> marvel 3 is an anime fighter
[2:20:33] <+Jaysky> Draph = shortstack
[2:20:40] <ravencloak13> Well you have Zeta and the gameplay is really fast cause of messing up once you die
[2:20:41] <Sol_Install> yea SF is anime
[2:20:42] <am_omega> Lowain is legit that guy who says "Man I could have totally made top 8"
[2:20:45] <Applecannon63> Naruto is anime fighter
[2:20:46] <CutCombo> Street fighter does not have subsystems
[2:20:49] <CrazyMedicine> RPGSeven
[2:20:50] <+mans51> maybe there needs to be a weaboo fighter category
[2:20:54] <arkv01> @akuda_bar now I'm curious, what sin did he commit
[2:21:01] <Confused_Nina> marvel 3 is a vs fighter, they're close to anime fighters in terms of mobility but are their own thing
[2:21:02] <KoalaBeige> Hello beatiful humans
[2:21:11] <nothuzad> mans51 the main distinction is mostly: does it have air dashes
[2:21:15] <floralkami> @am_omega them bois literally be at the cabinets in the menu screen
[2:21:16] <+tearknack> @arkv01 yelling too much at bigots
[2:21:16] <Applecannon63> Arena fighter=Anime
[2:21:16] <VillainForACause> Ladiva is THE character for you/
[2:21:18] <%RioGascar> I guess the issue for us is we have no character we can attach to. With street fighter we all like some character, ki as well. Dbfz we played cause we all watched dragonball and liked the characters
[2:21:19] <VillainForACause> For everyone!
[2:21:22] <arkv01> LUL
[2:21:23] <KoalaBeige> Im having a stupidly nice day since the dbfz announcements
[2:21:25] <MayorRev> sounds like smash
[2:21:30] <heartlesshealer> It was tone of post and prolonging the argument
[2:21:38] <%theluckyhero> Cheer500 I wasn't sure who I wanted to play till I saw that Zeta character trailer
[2:21:41] <%theluckyhero> theluckyhero's Cheer shared rewards to 10 others in Chat! 
[2:21:42] <%RioGascar> i need nero in a fighting game
[2:21:45] <%RioGascar> i need him
[2:21:47] <nothuzad> KoalaBeige ? what announcements
[2:21:49] <Applecannon63> Arena Based= Anime Fighter
[2:21:50] <%Irridium> Yeah DBFZ was my first fighter I got "serious" with mainly because I just love dragonball and played it hard
[2:21:51] <Andrei11Droasca> But still got bad netcode tho
[2:21:52] <Confused_Nina> Zeta is a queen
[2:21:54] <Mix_Master_Mao> I'm going to burst a blood vessel when they talk about grabble on the podcast. Probably.
[2:21:55] <KoalaBeige> @RioGascar capcom all stars hopefully
[2:21:57] <MayorRev> dont worry nero will be in smash someday
[2:22:05] <MayorRev> Kappa
[2:22:05] <coreybom> @riogascar How are you and your friends with MK?
[2:22:06] <KoalaBeige> @nothuzad 3 assits for every character boyyy

[2:22:19] <KoalaBeige> and no more fuzzies
[2:22:20] <Applecannon63> Nero mus be in Smash tho
[2:22:20] <+Crimznking> I'm hoping we get sunspot Zeta, I like that getup alot
[2:22:37] <%RioGascar> There’s character in mk i do like. But that game i just dont “enjoy” its feel
[2:22:40] <ravencloak13> Mean her bikini outfit?
[2:22:43] <+NotHereToStream> oh right delay based netcode
[2:22:47] <Andrei11Droasca> I mean for fuck sakes Fight of Animals has better netcode then this LUL
[2:22:49] <arkv01> dark zeta outfit is EXTRA
[2:22:50] <zayasu> @DingusMcBaseball donations and subs
[2:23:00] <OkamiDude15> hope we get alt costumes. zeta's dark SSR is rad
[2:23:03] <SilentGaming49> Why can't Guilty Gear be out.
[2:23:07] <DingusMcBaseball> @zayasu oh thx
[2:23:08] <hntronium> brute smarts it
[2:23:09] <+Crimznking> @ravencloak13 No her dark attribute outfit
[2:23:15] <KoalaBeige> @SilentGaming49 i know right
[2:23:19] <@akuda_bar> keep it cripsy
[2:23:22] <%RioGascar> and gg i feel bad cause so far all attempts have failed with friends
[2:23:25] <SilentGaming49> Give me my Faust
[2:23:29] <Mix_Master_Mao> alt costumes never
[2:23:30] <Applecannon63> Hope Alter Gran/Djeeta or Eternal Edge Gran/Djeeta for dlc
[2:23:33] <am_omega> Is her dark attribute one the outfit with the jacket?
[2:23:37] <OkamiDude15> yeah
[2:23:39] <+Taglog7> Play sf4 trials
[2:23:40] <ravencloak13> I call that her Gunbasta outfit
[2:23:42] <nothuzad> OkamiDude15 I think tehre are special colors/costumes when you finish story on hard
[2:23:42] <Pnutz409> that was tekken
[2:23:44] <+NYCrownlessKing> KI? @WoolieVersus
[2:23:46] <heartlesshealer> Under Night has a lot
[2:23:46] <+Crimznking> @am_omega yep
[2:23:47] <NicholasKane> tekken
[2:23:49] <+CrystalLakeWasJusASetback> Link timing is just developing the muscle memory so you don't have to think about it in matches.
[2:23:50] <CutCombo> Blaze blue
[2:23:50] <OldManDeckardCain> woolie pls
[2:23:51] <+tearknack> tekken
[2:23:52] <KoalaBeige> Thats SF5 trials
[2:23:52] <+NotHereToStream> only in trials right?
[2:23:55] <heartlesshealer> but not that
[2:23:56] <Confused_Nina> tekken doesnt have links though
[2:23:57] <am_omega> Ah sick that outfit is cool.
[2:23:58] <+NarcissistCactus> baby gran ultra instinct gran
[2:23:58] <%RioGascar> Im hoping gg strive will hit me and my friends cause it does seem like a fun game
[2:24:01] <MayorRev> its pronounced TUHKEN
[2:24:02] <coreybom> @riogascar That's fair. Either you're gonna be with the feel of MK or it's not for you. Have you tried out stuff like Skullgirls and punch planet?
[2:24:03] <OkamiDude15> @nothuzad evo19MindBlown
[2:24:13] <ravencloak13> The tutorials in this game are pretty good to.
[2:24:14] <Pnutz409> Deggen
[2:24:17] <SilentGaming49> None of my friends like Fighters, like at all. it's kinda sad
[2:24:27] <+NotHereToStream> lab it up
[2:24:27] <Applecannon63> Yeah Gran actually has a super sayain look
[2:24:28] <dan_g_v> dont think, feel
[2:24:30] <KoalaBeige> Friends are overrated anyway
[2:24:31] <SilentGaming49> They like Nidhogg and that's IT
[2:24:32] <Pnutz409> @SilentGaming49 none of my friends like videogames...
[2:24:32] <nothuzad> GBF VS has abit improved GG tutorials (which are decent)
[2:24:33] <+primax104> Mk 11 also has something like that
[2:24:34] <+thackattack00> I hate links. i just want to mash out my combos as fast as i can
[2:24:37] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the unist training mode is the true final boss, you defeat that and you automatically win EVO. Trust me
[2:24:40] <Fujiwara_92> just do it until you doing it basically
[2:24:40] <ravencloak13> Super Saiyan God*
[2:24:41] <+Crimznking> @silentgaming49 Gotta find some locals and make some more friends
[2:24:52] <%RioGascar> i have tried quite a lot of fighters. tekken we all love BUT ABSOLUTE trash, but we at least have characters we like
[2:24:56] <OkamiDude15> gran got super saiyan blue outfit
[2:24:56] <+Jaysky> More friends bad
[2:25:06] <%jiggy_snipe> @SilentGaming49 sucks doesn't it FeelsBadMan
[2:25:08] <Pnutz409> hahaha
[2:25:08] <arkv01> @SilentGaming49 I was that 'friend' a two years ago while all my buddies were deep in there, you just gotta introduce them to fisticuffs and GIFG LUL
[2:25:09] <Superdandy96> I ended up missing the stream,(damn it!) How’d it go? Was it fun?
[2:25:09] <ravencloak13> Links are just learn the timing from switching between like say a mid to a low
[2:25:10] <Fujiwara_92> LUL
[2:25:11] <%RioGascar> the game we are actually “best” at is actually garou: mark of wolves. i love my rock howard
[2:25:14] <+NotHereToStream> multiple input in a short time
[2:25:14] <Pnutz409> onion peeled
[2:25:17] <Confused_Nina> whats a piano
[2:25:23] <floralkami> @SilentGaming49 if they like that, they can definitely get into fighters. They just need something decent to relate it to.
[2:25:23] <Andrei11Droasca> I just double tap te buton to buffer
[2:25:24] <DeathByPoke7> my tip for links is if the moves doesnt come you its too fast if your moves are blocked then its too slow
[2:25:25] <OkamiDude15> @Superdandy96 they liked it but its time to switch over to doom
[2:25:26] <Applecannon63> Eternal Edge= Super Sayain God Blue
[2:25:27] <SilentGaming49> There's no locals here, I've looked. College I'm going to has a GG and UNIST scene tho.
[2:25:27] <@akuda_bar> i never played piano tho
[2:25:29] <%RioGascar> one friend loves his tizoc
[2:25:29] <Confused_Nina> whats a key
[2:25:31] <Fujiwara_92> whats piano tho
[2:25:38] <+TraapOS> button?
[2:25:39] <ravencloak13> It's also easier to piano on a fight stick then say a controller.
[2:25:39] <DedlokPM> What's a button?
[2:25:40] <Fujiwara_92> what's a button LUL
[2:25:44] <arkv01> thats rad, befriend the shit outta your college scene
[2:25:45] <%yeknomlive> mash on the piano
[2:25:45] <coreybom> @riogascar Hey everybody starts out as trash, but keep going and you'll be "semi" okay. Maybe even Diego level.

[2:25:59] <+Crimznking> @silentgaming49 Unist is great if you haven't tried it
[2:26:06] <Andrei11Droasca> Its not that hard
[2:26:07] <%Prevot> Get Into Fighting Games (Terminology)
[2:26:07] <Gralevert> it's a rhythm lol
[2:26:09] <%MoralCompassGaming> I'm a Hwoarang main, i apparently make people salty because of this main
[2:26:14] <ravencloak13> And why characters like Ed and Falke in Street Fighter 5 is easier on fight sticks cause you need to piano with them a lot espesially Falke
[2:26:21] <scrumbotime> Fighting game mechanics are the real Woolie Hole
[2:26:21] <Fujiwara_92> what's a rhythm
[2:26:33] <Confused_Nina> what are fighting games, explain in detail please
[2:26:36] <OkamiDude15> whats a fighting game?
[2:26:39] <+GreatSmasherPunch> @WoolieVersus Thanks Woolie! Just gonna brute smart this shit!
[2:26:42] <@akuda_bar> what are games
[2:26:46] <ravencloak13> Basically if your good at music rhythme games you can get fighting games easier,.
[2:26:47] <%Irridium> what is a game?
[2:26:47] <Fujiwara_92> what
[2:26:47] <KoalaBeige> Im far into fighting games and still have to google "whats a fuzzie" every month. My brain is broken
[2:26:48] <+CrystalLakeWasJusASetback> Plinking basically gives you an extra frame to land your link.
[2:26:48] <@akuda_bar> what is woolie
[2:26:49] <DedlokPM> what is a priority?
[2:26:51] <arkv01> plinking? is that like twerking but on your fight stick?
[2:26:56] <Confused_Nina> what is
[2:26:56] <%Irridium> what are we?
[2:26:57] <Fujiwara_92> just what
[2:26:58] <OkamiDude15> what is the universal truth father woolie?
[2:26:59] <@akuda_bar> what
[2:27:01] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> everybody asks what a fighting game is, but nobody asks how a fighting game is
[2:27:01] <SilentGaming49> The only Rythm that exist is the Infinite combo and nothing else
[2:27:03] <%Irridium> w
[2:27:03] <hntronium> what is?
[2:27:06] <KoalaBeige> what is love tho
[2:27:06] <OkamiDude15> w
[2:27:10] <%Solidnick18> lol
[2:27:12] <laguerrilha> what
[2:27:12] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:27:12] <@akuda_bar> i'm worrying about it
[2:27:14] <+Taglog7> what about Plinket?
[2:27:16] <+NotHereToStream> does negative edge help during pianoing
[2:27:16] <laguerrilha> is that french?
[2:27:16] <DedlokPM> what is a understanding?
[2:27:18] <Andrei11Droasca> Wat is love? Baby dont hurt me !
[2:27:19] <DeathByPoke7> Now explain DHC glitch
[2:27:20] <arkv01> 草
[2:27:24] <%kapcommunist> whats up with this word limit thing
[2:27:24] <%jiggy_snipe> this is fun tho Kappa
[2:27:25] <hntronium> Is this a fightman?
[2:27:26] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> FOR FUN
[2:27:29] <Confused_Nina> so i ask mr plinkett to do links?
[2:27:34] <ravencloak13> You just have to feel the rythme in your soul when you play a fighting game
[2:27:34] <%RioGascar> @coreybom Oh we will probably stay trash. We only play on Saturdays and even then its not all the time. we just play with each other. Tried local stuff and it got hard to cordinate friends to go to a college on Wednesdays and thurs.
[2:27:37] <arkv01> plinking sounds kinda hot...
[2:27:38] <+Taglog7> LUL
[2:27:51] <Fujiwara_92> just do it until you're doing it
[2:27:58] <%RioGascar> im fine with being trash at fighting games
[2:28:05] <Pnutz409> First time I learned about plinking was when I went to a local and I heard 500 button presses for a 3 hit combo
[2:28:12] <arkv01> same, I'm garbage at inputs but I still love the scene
[2:28:14] <%RioGascar> cause i would habe to dedicate too much time to em. i got other games i wanna play
[2:28:16] <OldManDeckardCain> in granblue you can get more links if the enemy is crouching btw
[2:28:23] <Confused_Nina> you need to just learn the timing, there's no shortcuts
[2:28:25] <KoalaBeige> You have to train the memory muscle
[2:28:27] <nothuzad> KoalaBeige specific properties that allow you to switch from blocking high and low while being in block stun
[2:28:29] <+NotHereToStream> lab it
[2:28:37] <%RioGascar> that and VR is currently sucking away my life
[2:28:40] <@akuda_bar> explain what a Reggie is
[2:28:47] <am_omega> For a fighting game you just have to get a feeling of a character that fits how you play like you are finding your hole in the Amigra fault.
[2:28:47] <alrobot2014> so do you push the button you don't want to come out in the recovery time before the next button you want to come out?
[2:28:49] <+Taglog7> When do I knee the tiger?
[2:28:49] <CalderGaming> tap without rhythm, and you won't execute the worm
[2:28:50] <%RioGascar> half life alyx gonna be lit
[2:28:50] <Andrei11Droasca> To be fair i only ever got pretty got at Xrd and KI LUL
[2:28:54] <+CrystalLakeWasJusASetback> When I learn a new game, I use the sound of the hit as part of my timing
[2:28:56] <KoalaBeige> @nothuzad Thanks. I will screenshot this for tomorrow when I forget AGAIN lol
[2:28:59] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> is Reggie a fighting game?
[2:29:00] <laguerrilha> is Reggie a smash lingo?
[2:29:04] <arkv01> do the LERNING
[2:29:11] <arkv01> is this true love
[2:29:11] <nothuzad> KoalaBeige dont worry is highly specific stuff
[2:29:14] <Pnutz409> For FUN!
[2:29:14] <Fujiwara_92> what's learning
[2:29:15] <+jkobe34> Nice
[2:29:17] <%Solidnick18> FeelsGoodMan
[2:29:19] <@akuda_bar> is mayonnaise a fighting game
[2:29:22] <coreybom> @riogascar oh fuck that can be a bitch. But as long you guys enjoy fighting games, be it playing or watching, that's the greatest thing. Even if we're all trash babies.
[2:29:28] <Fujiwara_92> woolieFUN
[2:29:29] <%Reverend_Roscoe> when's Tekken 7 again?
[2:29:29] <anonymuzz25_17> yo i'm still here, testing out eliza and having a BLAST
[2:29:33] <SilentGaming49> You get a fighter and you get a fighter and you get a fighter!
[2:29:34] <%RioGascar> Oh we loved watching evo
[2:29:37] <Pnutz409> wait there was a sg2 LP?
[2:29:38] <hntronium> The lower barrier is free
[2:29:40] <+GarbageNirvana> yeyeye
[2:29:43] <%RioGascar> evo is hype to watch no matter what
[2:29:43] <KoalaBeige> Honestly the best part for me is get a new fighting game and knowing nothing about it and testing shit
[2:29:49] <+machinetoys> 1.99 what?
[2:30:00] <SilentGaming49> Everyone needs to have Skullgirls on everything
[2:30:00] <CalderGaming> @akuda_bar if there isn't a doujin fighter with "mayonnaise" in the title yet there will be one soon
[2:30:01] <ravencloak13> Time for Woolie to be the Oprah Winfriey of Fighter Games
[2:30:03] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> gotta keep the skullgirls launch party going
[2:30:04] <+cherrypiestealer> sbfpGou sbfpGi
[2:30:06] <arkv01> yeah Geforce now is REALLY GOOD
[2:30:08] <%Irridium> it's apparently Stadia but actually works
[2:30:10] <Fujiwara_92> stadia LUL
[2:30:11] <%Prevot> shill donation
[2:30:11] <arkv01> the lag time is almost indiscernable
[2:30:14] <@akuda_bar> @CalderGaming wings of mayonnaise is an anime
[2:30:15] <%jiggy_snipe> the internet tho
[2:30:16] <%RioGascar> Only 1 hr tho
[2:30:18] <+R_BChe> geforce even has a free plan
[2:30:23] <am_omega> Like when you get a character that fits you should be in boxers screaming "This character is made for meeeee!"
[2:30:23] <%RioGascar> then its 5.99
[2:30:26] <SilentGaming49> I literally own Skullgirls on everything it's out on. Do it cowards
[2:30:33] <hntronium> Is the speed of light too slow for you woolie-san?
[2:30:33] <Andrei11Droasca> Iea its like a legit stadia
[2:30:36] <coreybom> Basically stadia but actually good, and made by people who are the gaming industry.
[2:30:37] <heartlesshealer> press x to doubt, but hesitating over the button
[2:30:43] <DedlokPM> It's stadia, but it is the games you already own
[2:30:47] <Fujiwara_92> what's the name of that?
[2:30:54] <ravencloak13> Geforce
[2:30:57] <CalderGaming> @akuda_bar i love putting honneamise on my sandwiches
[2:30:58] <DedlokPM> @Fujiwara_92 NVida Now

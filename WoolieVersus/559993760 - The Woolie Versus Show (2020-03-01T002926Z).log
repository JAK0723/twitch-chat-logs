[0:14:57] <big_oki> supported bycoke?
[0:15:02] <%RioGascar> Unless SNAKE oil stole this from something else
[0:15:04] <dapperskeleton69> CAH is best taken in doses while inebriated

[0:16:19] <@Solidus_113> The Biggest, Blackest Box expansion
[0:16:20] <thewizardchan> I suppose Snake Oil is more open-ended than this. You're always making a show here so that might make things either easier or harder depending on how it works.
[0:16:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> 5 big black cocks is a good card
[0:16:39] <dapperskeleton69> my fav black card is "the office of"
[0:16:56] <%CaptainPileDriver> there's also the box jokes
[0:17:02] <%CaptainPileDriver> like pandora's vagina
[0:17:12] <%RioGascar> yeah this sounds like snake oil with anime instead of investment pitchs
[0:17:13] <worldbrand> this is going to immediately devolve into Podcast Title: the game
[0:17:18] <dapperskeleton69> i just remembered i made a black card in CAH that went "____, thats REAL hiphop"

[1:08:01] <%jiggy_snipe> it's a magical girl anime so it works with the title
[1:08:06] <thewizardchan> Is there a minimum card limit of 3? Could you just drop the one?
[1:08:17] <%RioGascar> its 4 words limit

[1:21:01] <%Javaa01> HahaGoose
[1:21:13] <%RioGascar> Yeah reggie and then you went to space
[1:21:14] <+Pookiedaexzile> So Woolie is RowdyRuffBoys just the PowerPuffgirls
[1:21:15] <%The_Timo> a second?
[1:21:17] <%Ipsenscastle> Reggie with the reasonable take
[1:21:18] <%Taglog7> No one mentioned captain planet
[1:21:18] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Timer
[1:21:19] <TigerClaws12> HUSTLE
[1:21:21] <SlappyMeats> honestly we should do a timer regardless
[1:21:27] <%RioGascar> @taglog7 He aint anime
[1:21:28] <%The_Timo> I had to change calenders in the middle of Woolie's pitch
[1:21:30] <NeroInfinite> Woolie Rambled a bitmore yeah.
[1:21:30] <%invisi_bliss> Yo chill your shit Woolz
[1:21:32] <%Ipsenscastle> BIG TANTRUM BABY
[1:21:34] <%jiggy_snipe> have a timer just to see how long they take
[1:21:41] <+Pookiedaexzile> Is Ken Barbie
[1:21:43] <worldbrand> 60 second timer!
[1:21:45] <dapperskeleton69> big gay baby jail time
[1:21:48] <%madogod> mommy and daddies stop fighting
[1:21:54] <%RioGascar> but stalling title drop is a TATIC
[1:22:00] <%The_Timo> ALRIGHT, I'm gonna time all future pitches
[1:22:02] <+Pookiedaexzile> Damn
[1:22:14] <%RioGascar> cause sometimes a shit title is hurt less by delaying it and building up the story
[1:22:14] <%Javaa01> Stalling for 3 minutes is too much
[1:22:15] <@Solidus_113> Remember, elevators
[1:22:20] <%Taglog7> Drop the name like the Op would
[1:22:20] <%jiggy_snipe> he was stalling for a bad title
[1:22:24] <dapperskeleton69> @the_timo more like the_timeo
[1:22:36] <Econ01> Im going to stay with minh for a little while
[1:22:40] <%The_Timo> @dapperskeleton69 SHhhh my secret identity
[1:22:54] <glass_marcus> NO MORE FILLIBUSTERING
[1:22:58] <nyacoo> Super salt
[1:23:02] <dapperskeleton69> I LIKE IKE
[1:23:18] <randomness_yo> PJSalt PJSalt Cmon Woolie. XD
[1:23:21] <%The_Timo> Oh we'll see, When you edit this, put timers on each pitch and we'll see lol
[1:23:22] <SlappyMeats> I do like the title at the end, universally
[1:23:22] <%RioGascar> its a calculated risk
[1:23:36] <%jiggy_snipe> Megamiken
[1:23:49] <dapperskeleton69> woolie got called out for his keikaku
[1:23:51] <worldbrand> i did like reggie's pitch
[1:24:01] <SlappyMeats> since the title is what you're building with the cards, it should be what is revealed at the end
[1:24:03] <WG101> just needs less space
[1:24:03] <%RioGascar> Eco space
[1:24:07] <+Pookiedaexzile> Boxing Show
[1:24:11] <Econ01> Reggie killed that round
[1:24:20] <@Solidus_113> every anime must go to space
[1:24:26] <$SilverRoddo> I think the producer should help move the pitch along? Idk. I mean, the producer is a busy person.
[1:24:31] <thewizardchan> If you have a decent title, drop it at the start. If you have a FUCKING WINNER you drop it at the end.
[1:24:33] <%RioGascar> Nah slappy title can be dropped at the start middle or end
[1:24:38] <%Ipsenscastle> Is Woolie wearing Pat's lizardface glasses?
[1:24:48] <dapperskeleton69> welcome to channel A where the titles are made up and the points dont matter Kappa thats right the points are just like woolie's real name doesnt matter
[1:24:49] <NeroInfinite> Nah
[1:24:54] <worldbrand> the producer should be able to interrupt to give them ideas or make them swerve
[1:24:56] <NeroInfinite> PAt kept his lizard glasses
[1:25:03] <pirateofpie> LUL
[1:25:11] <SlappyMeats> ah shit

[1:25:54] <SlappyMeats> nah, a dystopia doesn't even seem perfect
[1:25:55] <$SilverRoddo> Cyber-Dinotopia
[1:25:56] <%Ipsenscastle> that's not what a dystopia is
[1:26:00] <thewizardchan> All utopias are dystopias when you look under the hood
[1:26:01] <+Pookiedaexzile> Woolievwromg
[1:26:04] <NeroInfinite> That's jus t a dystopia
[1:26:04] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:26:05] <NeroInfinite> LUL
[1:26:07] <worldbrand> a dystopia is JUSt the opposite
[1:26:07] <Prevot> isn't this just The Matrix
[1:26:08] <glass_marcus> Dytopia just means shit is fucked
[1:26:10] <autcetera> dystopias don't have to appear perfect y'all
[1:26:12] <pirateofpie> A dystopia is just a pile of shit
[1:26:12] <%Taglog7> HahaThink HahaThink HahaThink
[1:26:15] <%jiggy_snipe> Woolie's wrong
[1:26:16] <%RioGascar> 2049 is not a utopia
[1:26:18] <@Solidus_113> It's a perfect dystopia that everyone wants
[1:26:28] <WG101> ANARCHY REIGNS
[1:26:32] <+ggbhtg> big wrong woolie
[1:26:32] <%Theycallmenerf> Not a dystopia not a dystopia not a dystopia
[1:26:34] <+TomServal> @genesisknight Wasn't that also Kikai?
[1:26:34] <SlappyMeats> Utopia is an idyllic society, whereas Dystopia is a broken society
[1:26:37] <mr_miyagichu> Gunma?
[1:26:37] <+Pookiedaexzile> Wrong boy is big Wrong
[1:26:39] <%Ipsenscastle> walk it back woolz
[1:26:42] <%RioGascar> We are in a dystopia
[1:26:43] <worldbrand> but also woolie is just looking for The Ones Who Walk from Omelas
[1:26:43] <%The_Timo> Ha
[1:26:46] <$SilverRoddo> CHAOS REIGNS
[1:26:51] <dapperskeleton69> woolie might as well have put a double negative
[1:26:52] <Econ01> Over under on reggie taking this pitch to space
[1:26:56] <+GenesisKnight> @TomServal There was less Utopia in Kikai
[1:26:58] <dapperskeleton69> its just CYBPERUNK
[1:27:05] <%jiggy_snipe> so Woolie's concepts cancel out
[1:27:06] <worldbrand> let's go to space babey
[1:27:09] <%RioGascar> Star trek tng is utopia
[1:27:09] <NeroInfinite> YEAH

[1:27:32] <Sedrelic> you DINGUS
[1:27:33] <$SilverRoddo> Tek War Wasteland
[1:27:38] <SlappyMeats> HOWEVER, Woolie's explanation is certainly how you could reconcile the dystopia/utpoia idea
[1:27:40] <dapperskeleton69> you TOOL
[1:27:42] <+Pookiedaexzile> "Theres a ws;l
[1:27:46] <WG101> Neon Wasteland

[2:06:22] <Prevot> oh god
[2:06:23] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @GarbageNirvana i would argue that the director and the screen writer took the book at face value(due to political views). I mean the movie does a great job at making satire at hawkish politics and military stuff. But not so much with the aspect of a facist society.

[3:38:23] <dapperskeleton69> NOOOO
[3:38:26] <+TehBeerBaron> @Lizard0TM It's pretty simple. Players can't see their own cards. On your turn you can discard a card for time block, use a time block to give a player info about their card, or play a card on the table. You need 1-5 of the same color to get more time.
[3:38:26] <dapperskeleton69> the shades

[4:00:09] <unclerizla> @Megaleg Hey now. I grew up with RT and damn if they haven't produced a ton of very enjoyable content over the years. Not only that, but they've made themselves a bit of a media conglomerate. Burnie Burns and Matt Hullum have done a heck of a job
[4:00:26] <dapperskeleton69> it was absolutely a true story

[4:01:32] <%K2YP70C0CK> Micheal McDonal scene
[4:01:45] <dapperskeleton69> yes CSB is sponsored by rooster teeth

[4:51:10] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> HYPE
[4:51:21] <%StaceMcGate> watch this and get hype. Then see the in-game models and experience sadness
[4:51:26] <randomness_yo> Great intro! Great crossover! Great idea! Horrible game!
[4:51:57] <%SomersaultJustice> #Valkyrie4SC6
[4:51:58] <Make_me_mad> The game is fun. Just too long, imo.
[4:52:18] <Make_me_mad> Not interesting enough to last through the sheer amount of missions and grunts you gotta murder.
[4:52:19] <+Cyoctane> ohhh is this what Max's intro animation is partly based on?
[4:52:22] <Arek_1> @StaceMcGate Models? They're decent sprites.
[4:52:43] <Arek_1> @Cyoctane Yeah, this is part of that.
[4:52:48] <%StaceMcGate> @Arek_1 chibi sprites is not what I would expect from this sort of intro
[4:53:01] <Make_me_mad> I mean it's super robot wars based. Makes sense.
[4:53:02] <Jathspuh> PogChamp
[4:53:04] <Arek_1> @StaceMcGate True.

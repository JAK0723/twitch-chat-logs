[0:19:43] <+jiggy_snipe> Hood Avatar is an actual thing
[0:19:44] <+hawk_rush> avatar's got some dank memes
[0:19:45] <+sinistersally> I heard HiRez and Avatar was doing a crossover... I thought it was for Palladins...
[0:19:46] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:19:48] <%Th3SmartAlec> He took my cabbages
[0:19:49] <+ringabal> Hood Avatar is a cinematic masterpiece
[0:19:50] <Daniel_Is_I> That's rough, buddy.
[0:20:21] <Ianrazz> I love for honor but why Warden??? SNK seemed to pick the most milktoast option, what about Appolyon??
[0:20:31] <%Josef_Stryker> Zuko best boy
[0:20:38] <+hawk_rush> going from naruto to avatar, jesus christ what a whiplash
[0:20:40] <%Deepfriedhamster> i saw a live action catus water seem
[0:20:42] <+hawk_rush> in quality
[0:20:51] <+UberWolfman> I would’ve picked a Viking cast member
[0:20:52] <%eyezehuhh> LUL
[0:20:59] <theprinceoftekkers> Jah bless 🇬🇳
[0:20:59] <%HollowedIdjit> Warden is more or less the face of For Honor, also Samurai Shodown has never had a European Longsword user iirc

[0:21:03] <+sinistersally> Have you seen his Grandson, tho (swoon)

[0:21:42] <+Slattsquatch> Hello, Zuko here
[0:21:50] <+thackattack00> 11k players but I still get stomped by killers every match NotLikeThis
[0:21:59] <jorniev> WARDEN LOOKS COOL in samurai showdown
[0:22:00] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Slattsquatch Zuko desu LUL
[0:22:05] <Ianrazz> @huskarl_zap She has personality for starters. Waden is literally a blank screen. Just see Maximilian reaction too it. At least Appolyon looks edgy
[0:22:15] <thesickestzak> Hello fellow kids. Yes I am zuko. Let's avatar!
[0:22:24] <%Deepfriedhamster> thats rough buddy
[0:22:24] <@akuda_bar> the fact team avatar goes like "hell no, go away" is so much better than all the times in other shows where they're like "WE WANTED YOU TO JOIN THE WHOLE TIME"
[0:22:40] <%Superbro64> the solar eclipse invasion 2 parter needs to be talked about more
[0:22:41] <%Deepfriedhamster> no one wants his fire dick
[0:22:42] <Daniel_Is_I> Zuko screaming at God is a great moment
[0:22:44] <huskarl_zap> Haurspex"thats rough buddy"
[0:22:46] <%Lion_kun> Except Toph
[0:22:47] <%Deepfriedhamster> until they feel the warmth
[0:22:56] <%Superbro64> those episodes were SO HYPED UP back in the day
[0:22:57] <%Lion_kun> Toph gets jackshit
[0:22:58] <DragonSpooker> Suckswe didn't get Toph Zuko episode
[0:22:58] <%lotharrio> And Toph doesn't have bad blood with him, so she doesn't get an episode with Zuko.
[0:23:09] <bamboostick4> Todoroki is a Zuko ripoff
[0:23:17] <Ianrazz> I hope people give for honor a shot of this crossover BUT for outsiders this seems random and kinda dumb

[0:24:43] <+arcielardor> cheer500 Poor, sweet Woolie. Just finished your first VOD of this game and if you think Hooktail and the princess shower are bad, strap in. I have three contextless, spoiler-free prophecies for you: First you will get a short series of letters from Koops' girlfriend that explain why Hooktail said certain things. Second, you will name a newborn infant shortly before using it as a weapon in a prizefight. Third, you experience a Nicholas Cage movie plot as one of the chapters in the game.

[0:26:10] <%Deepfriedhamster> grow as a person you must explore yourself
[0:26:10] <Ianrazz> Like Black Prior has a story in game and he is a knight hero. Whatever i just hope people don't think this small snippet of For Honor design represents the entire identy of for honor as a generic medieval game. As a fan of both games, i hope people give these awesome fighting games a shot

[0:26:39] <Solidnick18> @BallerSwagBro9k bold choice
[0:26:41] <+Quarkee> @choculaultra thanks man, vineMayro
[0:26:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> Wait we talking about Naruto AGAIN!?
[0:26:46] <+ringabal> Sasuke's "character resolution" is just Kishimoto's want for apology porn
[0:26:51] <%Deepfriedhamster> Datebayo
[0:26:53] <+jiggy_snipe> tbf Sasuke is cool in Boruto but yea we didn't get to experience it
[0:26:53] <%Josef_Stryker> Thanks for the PrideShrug @vextalyst
[0:26:56] <CyrusVGZ> Sasuke's redemption thing came in a novel.
[0:27:01] <%Lion_kun> It'a not my fault, my eyes makes me genetically go crazy.
[0:27:04] <huskarl_zap> tbh for honor needs less story design and go back to closed helms being their faces
[0:27:05] <%Coo_coo1> god dammit i tuned out for literally 10 seconds woolie
[0:27:07] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Lion_kun
[0:27:10] <+Grayhammatter> naruto is pretty bad
[0:27:12] <%Superbro64> Itachi should of slapped Sasuke's shit in when he was ressurected
[0:27:12] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:27:13] <+hawk_rush> LUL
[0:27:18] <%ChoculaUltra> I really do wanna meet the irl friend Kishimoto DEFINITELY based Sasuke on and what beef they had. If it really is based on the irl beef he has with his brother I am ALL for it LUL
[0:27:19] <%Deepfriedhamster> Read this message and get excite
[0:27:28] <+hawk_rush> fucking gaara was redeemed so well
[0:27:29] <@Menitta> I am excite
[0:27:32] <+EtheralFlameX> who does orochi blame it on?
[0:27:40] <+hawk_rush> and then the ball got dropped
[0:27:40] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Gaara should've MC
[0:27:41] <%Deepfriedhamster> Good
[0:27:42] <%Th3SmartAlec> Nah, fuck her
[0:27:43] <Cozy90> i wonder what woolie thinks of yu yu hakusho. thats my fav
[0:27:46] <+jiggy_snipe> naw everyone doesn't need redemption
[0:27:49] <%FuqBoiSlim> @etheralflamex dead parents?
[0:27:50] <CyrusVGZ> Woolie isn't completely wrong but I still love Naruto and it'll always be one of my favorite things ever.
[0:27:53] <jorniev> ROCK LEE SHOULD BE MC
[0:27:57] <+nintega010> Azula is awesome. Also in the comics your woolie she gets better
[0:27:58] <+jiggy_snipe> just like sometimes you gotta kill someone
[0:27:59] <%ChoculaUltra> did you see Gaara's Boruto hairstyle? They massacred my boy!
[0:28:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> Naw, Azula is crazy and she needed to go down.
[0:28:01] <glass_marcus> Nah she's crazy, she needs to go down
[0:28:05] <%Superbro64> I was impressed how deep under the bus Karin was threwn. Holy sweet jesus

[0:28:26] <Zayasu> holy shit new game expo is awful. atlus seriously showed 30 minutes catherine gameplay as their only thing
[0:28:31] <missingangle> One of the head writers, Aaron Ehasz, had planned a redemption arc for Azula, but they didn't have nearly enough time for it
[0:28:35] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Superbro64 Sarada was given red hair and glasses as a joke red herrring, FeelsBadMan
[0:28:36] <+jiggy_snipe> Garra looks like red headed Hitler LUL
[0:28:37] <ct_2> its called empathy
[0:28:40] <%Deepfriedhamster> Catherine is fine
[0:28:46] <+ToastyMozart> Azula was a product of her father's actions to a decent extent. I do think having her story end as a tragedy rather than pulling it back was really strong though.
[0:28:48] <%Deepfriedhamster> i kinda want another Adult themed game
[0:28:48] <%ChoculaUltra> Bro Might Guy fought Madara hand to hand, lost his leg, can't fight anymore and STILL looks better than Boruto Gaara. HOW SWAY
[0:28:50] <%Deepfriedhamster> from atlus
[0:28:51] <%Coo_coo1> READ THE COMICS!

[0:29:40] <%Deepfriedhamster> wooliePOYO woolieFUN
[0:29:42] <missingangle> @nintega010 Oh, I know. I enjoyed the Search fine, but Ehasz had a particular story for Azula that isn't reflected in the Search that honestly would have been touching, even if we didn't NEED an Azula redemption arc
[0:29:43] <%Superbro64> @th3smartalec dam
[0:29:46] <+nintega010> @hawk_rush i should to. I just watched a video that talked about Azula. It was good

[0:30:30] <%Ancopro> kimba the last airbender
[0:30:31] <gloppie> Korra tries to critique ideologies it doesn't really understand
[0:30:32] <CyrusVGZ> I liked Korra but you can tell Nickelodeon sabotaged the fuck out of its prodution.
[0:30:32] <+kapcommunist> @Deepfriedhamster just noticed. its godlike
[0:30:35] <+worldbrand> It's not that azula herself needed one so much as we want to believe a villain who is a child and product of lots of circumstances can be better
[0:30:41] <@Menitta> Oh shit the schedule
[0:30:54] <%Coo_coo1> DO IT! YEYEYE READ THOSE COMICS
[0:30:57] <%Deepfriedhamster> @kapcommunist i wanna know where its from
[0:30:57] <+hawk_rush> nani
[0:30:57] <missingangle> I really loved Korra, despite its flaws, I hate how Nick fucked it over constantly.
[0:31:01] <%FuqBoiSlim> just realized Woolie played the Korra video game before watching the actual show LUL
[0:31:01] <+hawk_rush> rewatching avatar is the best
[0:31:04] <%Superbro64> Question chat: was the studio that did Korra do Boondocks? I might be crazy but they have crazy similar artstyles
[0:31:10] <Noble_Nobunaga > i only rewatch something if i'm watching it with someone
[0:31:12] <%Th3SmartAlec> But rewatch Game of Thrones tho LUL LUL LUL
[0:31:13] <+Taglog7> It's the Past
[0:31:13] <%eyezehuhh> never ever?
[0:31:15] <@Menitta> !schedule
[0:31:16] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1275210654773915649?s=20
[0:31:16] <%Josef_Stryker> I personally love Korra. It's just not as good as ATLA.
[0:31:23] <+nintega010> You can Read One Piece
[0:31:23] <+ForgeTacular14> Yo, is Reggie wearing that shirt for ROLLBACK Melee?
[0:31:24] <@Menitta> sick
[0:31:25] <%lotharrio> Yeah, but One Piece
[0:31:26] <%Josef_Stryker> ATLA is a 9.5 while Korra is an 8.5
[0:31:27] <BlackermanZX> like One piece
[0:31:27] <+ringabal> Maaaaaaan, Boondocks Avatar would be wild
[0:31:27] <%lewdskeletor13> I rewatch stuff after it’s been awhile
[0:31:27] <Rhinoprotoss> Not rewatching things is how Woolie forgets things
[0:31:28] <CyrusVGZ> You like this show? Too bad we're cutting the budget and forcing you to put the rest of the series on our shitty website.
[0:31:30] <+EtheralFlameX> Do you watch a new porno everytime? no favorites?
[0:31:32] <huskarl_zap> CONSOOM
[0:31:33] <%Deepfriedhamster> I dont think so @Superbro64 but it was made in the west like boondocks
[0:31:33] <Nekros4442> This is the reason Woolie doesnt watch Brotherhood
[0:31:42] <%FuqBoiSlim> LUL N E P I E C E
[0:31:43] <+buckwheat70> Aang fucked!
[0:31:44] <missingangle> The problem with Korra is mostly that it follows the Last Airbender. It's hard to NOT compare, in some ways, which is unfair since it's nowhere near as good as the original
[0:31:45] <+Grayhammatter> consume next product
[0:31:48] <%Deepfriedhamster> New porn only
[0:31:52] <%Superbro64> @deepfriedhamster thanks
[0:31:52] <%Deepfriedhamster> everyday
[0:31:56] <thesickestzak> O N E P I E C E :)
[0:32:00] <ThatVisorGuy> Like rewatching The Office 20 times, like bruh come on theres so much out there.
[0:32:01] <%Superbro64> JUSTICE LEAGUE UNLIMITED
[0:32:02] <%Deepfriedhamster> no revisits
[0:32:02] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie Mind Goblins
[0:32:05] <+hawk_rush> but the aniime is sooooo good
[0:32:11] <%Deepfriedhamster> never watcht he same porsntar again
[0:32:11] <CyrusVGZ> One Piece is doodoo. Sorry not sorry.
[0:32:12] <+jiggy_snipe> Brotherhood is just the manga so you are good
[0:32:14] <+Loinclothiclese> no you didnt fma is not fma
[0:32:14] <+Taglog7> It's different
[0:32:16] <%lewdskeletor13> I rewatched Better Call Saul before the new season
[0:32:16] <@Menitta> Some things are really good on rewatch
[0:32:17] <%ChoculaUltra> Ling makes Brotherhood 100% worth it alone, FIGHT ME
[0:32:21] <Nekros4442> You could watch clips for the Sakuga though ;p
[0:32:21] <BlackermanZX> brotherhood is pretty good
[0:32:22] <+Grayhammatter> brotherhood is so good
[0:32:25] <%Josef_Stryker> Did Woolie already read the manga?
[0:32:25] <%Th3SmartAlec> Oh Manga, nevermind, you're good
[0:32:26] <huskarl_zap> CONSOOMED
[0:32:28] <%Klefth> Speaking of Brotherhood, they're gonna give Shaman King the same treatment and goddamn that manga is GOOD
[0:32:30] <+therabbles> h'es got the manga he's good
[0:32:31] <%Deepfriedhamster> are you talking about shows or porn or both
[0:32:31] <+Taglog7> Oh, manga. u gud
[0:32:31] <Ianrazz> Hey Woolie did you catch the SNK dlc announcement??? Where is the get into fighting games for honor? Jk, i love your content
[0:32:33] <muniea3> watch Brotherhood though
[0:32:37] <Noble_Nobunaga > Source material trumps all
[0:32:37] <+hawk_rush> @Klefth I'm so excited for that
[0:32:37] <+TreeeFOX> i just replayed LoU
[0:32:38] <@Menitta> There are some movies I would tell people to watch twice
[0:32:39] <%Klefth> Brotherhood is VERT different
[0:32:41] <+Loinclothiclese> the original is made up
[0:32:43] <+hawk_rush> yep
[0:32:44] <%Klefth> VERY*
[0:32:50] <dreadedcthulhu> I'm still salty abt how much of the ishvalan war arc got toned down in bhood
[0:32:52] <+jiggy_snipe> Brotherhood is the manga adaption. Original was a new story
[0:32:53] <Nekros4442> Yeah you do you
[0:32:53] <%Deepfriedhamster> i rewatch shit all the time
[0:32:55] <+ToastyMozart> Brotherhood is kind of bland cinematography wise, you're not missing a ton if you've read the manga.
[0:32:55] <Daniel_Is_I> Brotherhood and OG split after the prison arc
[0:32:55] <WarKamex> brotherhood cuts some stuff but is otherwise very faithful
[0:33:08] <%Deepfriedhamster> i keep a list of Evergreen stuff to reccomend people
[0:33:13] <Brutalyte616> Watch Brotherhood for the fights.
[0:33:14] <derap41> Why not something new
[0:33:15] <benbag13> stream not working
[0:33:19] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> You didn't watch the FMA STAGE PLAY??
[0:33:20] <%ChoculaUltra> reminder that to this day, Shaman King Flowers has never been officially translated by Viz or any major company.
[0:33:22] <+terry_quest> go through one piece LUL
[0:33:24] <+therabbles> you can skip a couple of the first episodes of brotherhood because they are the same
[0:33:25] <enZymeth> The pacing for the Nina arc was too fast in brotherhood
[0:33:26] <Am_Shigar00> If you've already read the manga, then yeah, Brotherhood's absolutely no priority.
[0:33:29] <Daniel_Is_I> Brotherhood also speeds through the first few arcs because they knew the original anime covered them faithfully
[0:33:30] <$LightningLynx89> Watch FMA Brotherhood it's so good
[0:33:32] <andrex2311> wait did I miss the stream?!

[0:34:31] <TheLemuroid> If you read the FMA manga you are good
[0:34:32] <+GreenCMD> I'm upset how long I put off mob psycho, it was great.
[0:34:33] <%Deepfriedhamster> you;re a mob can you feel your satisfaction,
[0:34:38] <+Zenryoku21> If you read the manga its the same storyline
[0:34:39] <%Deepfriedhamster> that op is great
[0:34:40] <+hawk_rush> that's fair!
[0:34:48] <SomersaultJustice> it's wolly time

[0:35:13] <Zayasu> p4 anime is good
[0:35:15] <%eanscrale> The persona anime adaptions aren't great
[0:35:19] <%Th3SmartAlec> Yeah... that's more of a clipwatch
[0:35:19] <+ringabal> Yes, but actually no
[0:35:20] <Am_Shigar00> It's probably for the best to skip them.

[0:36:26] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> More like vaga-BAD
[0:36:26] <%Superbro64> Why would you watch the anime of something you played? Wouldn't the original game be a more fulfilling experience?
[0:36:27] <%Lion_kun> Have you read Lone Wolf and Cub
[0:36:27] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus Oh speaking of Vagabond, did you see the author and Akira Toriyama had a conversation about Shounen Jump?
[0:36:28] <huskarl_zap> I'm sitting here listening to this

[0:41:05] <CursedNobleman> what if forcefeeding is my fetish REGGIE
[0:41:09] <DontChuckle98> But then you guys would just keep talking about it. XD
[0:41:11] <%Th3SmartAlec> I watch for the beating of the dead horse
[0:41:11] <FrostedZaibatsu> What, if you want them to stop talking about it, so you want it to never happen?????
[0:41:17] <%Deepfriedhamster> Keep beating off that dead horse Woolie. never stop beating it off
[0:41:18] <+jiggy_snipe> you need to beat it though because the main big devs don't listen
[0:41:18] <+kapcommunist> ok lets never talk about racism ever again too Kappa
[0:41:20] <+ringabal> There's something about spitefulness that makes me chuckle
[0:41:29] <%Sedrelic> the podcast has been beat the horse cast since ever
[0:41:33] <+linSP> I absorb the net code talk I need to know
[0:41:33] <@akuda_bar> powered by spite
[0:41:40] <+BlumpyLumpkins> core feature of game genre is commonly discussed topic, more news at 11
[0:41:45] <%Deepfriedhamster> Rage boner against rollback
[0:41:49] <+worldbrand> spite can be a great motivator but for some reason most folks reserve it for incredibly petty subjects
[0:42:03] <+therabbles> if you want them to stop talking about it make support good netcode so that it can no longer be talked about
[0:42:13] <+terry_quest> imagine wanting things your passionate about to get better
[0:42:13] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:42:14] <%gatorafan> That horse is somehow still alive tho, It should have died like 10 years ago... But it's still living... It's kinda crazy
[0:42:15] <dabeaminator> "Twas but a jest"
[0:42:16] <%lotharrio> "Kyaah! Woolie-senpai noticed me!"
[0:42:18] <Cynical_Canadian> When are we getting to the Paperworks Factory?
[0:42:20] <%FuqBoiSlim> "stop talking about video games on the video game podcast 😡"
[0:42:23] <derap41> Its a Podcast you can zone out for it
[0:42:25] <+jiggy_snipe> spite is great when its to get back at someone actively screwing you over
[0:42:30] <DontChuckle98> You guys would just keep talking about it. So saying that is already contradicted. XD
[0:42:49] <TomFrank> just got here what are they talking about?
[0:43:04] <Cynical_Canadian> @TomFrank Netcode
[0:43:06] <%Deepfriedhamster> @TomFrank beating offdead horses

[0:43:13] <%lotharrio> OneGuy complained about Woolie talking about netcode.

[0:45:13] <TheLemuroid> If they clung to that there would be Dokopon
[0:45:15] <%Chatterbox1991> it's unintentionally disrespectful
[0:45:15] <0nieladb> From the Mat/Pat/Woolie perspective... this is like asking "Hey, you know that ex that broke your heart and left a permanent stain on how you view love?" when are you two getting back together? You were really cute!
[0:45:20] <CursedNobleman> ~I'm moving on, moving so far away...~

[1:16:29] <@akuda_bar> evil tree
[1:16:35] <Cynical_Canadian> This chapter is interesting and also kinda boring
[1:16:36] <insaneintentionsyo> worst level
[1:16:36] <+Ryu_R> puni woods is maybe like the worst
[1:16:37] <SomersaultJustice> you have no idea

[1:18:00] <%Jack8274> It's the worst chapter but still in the best game, it's still fine
[1:18:14] <@Menitta> Its the weakest but it's still good
[1:18:16] <CursedNobleman> punis are so cute PrideUwu

[1:18:20] <Am_Shigar00> I honestly don't remember it being that bad, but then again I also know what to do in it.
[1:18:28] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Ah
[1:18:29] <+Lawxy> I really hope they find the [spoiler redacted]
[1:18:31] <+Sliverits> It's better than chapter 5 tho
[1:18:33] <%Deepfriedhamster> underwater companion mission
[1:18:37] <thetntm> I'm fine with 4 because the chapter hits hard enough story wise but yeah back and fourth is a genuine complaint
[1:18:38] <Cynical_Canadian> I think Chapter 4 is the weakest, despite having great characters
[1:18:39] <%MayorRev> thanks Bernie
[1:18:39] <CyrusVGZ> Oh god, he does look like Bernie Sanders.
[1:18:48] <crossing_mao> Pikmin play through when?

[1:18:55] <%StarMechV> chapter 3 is gonna be so god hype
[1:18:58] <+ringabal> The price was TOO LOW
[1:19:00] <+Lawxy> actually a pikmin playthrough would be great
[1:19:01] <%lotharrio> Woolie, play big economics already.
[1:19:05] <AkumaMatataX_X> AkumaMatataX_X subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:19:09] <+Sliverits> Us all arguing about which chapters are the best despite everyone liking all of them

[1:19:11] <JetpackMcQuack> Don't ask how the sausage is made
[1:19:12] <+Grayhammatter> Thanks for the PrideFlower @akumamatatax_x

[1:19:23] <missingangle> As long as everyone agrees chapter 3 is fucking killer.
[1:19:25] <SomersaultJustice> I like chapter 4 the most tho
[1:19:31] <+hawk_rush> chapter 3 is a bit of a slog, but it's fun
[1:19:33] <thetntm> 4 is best on a first play through
[1:19:34] <shiny_prinny> LUL
[1:19:34] <Papa_Bearman> Actually, no, there's only a finite amount of Inn Coupons.
[1:19:35] <%Ancopro> in this world, probably LUL
[1:19:36] <+Dimfish> chapter 5 is my favorite
[1:19:36] <CursedNobleman> chapter 2 is my favorite LUL
[1:19:38] <@akuda_bar> all of them are great
[1:19:42] <PhantomMaskJr> majinoHooksubs BOP

[1:28:03] <Bguy32> Best badge in the game
[1:28:06] <RagnarokAM> SSS rank badge
[1:28:07] <%drewwartt> worth it tho
[1:28:08] <%lewdskeletor13> It’s very worth it
[1:28:09] <bbblaketwitching> *make
[1:28:11] <%Deepfriedhamster> show me that Bp Guuuuurl
[1:28:15] <Lunatyr_> I wish it was less, in the first game it was only 1 BP
[1:28:17] <+Euphbugg> This is one of the best if not the best badge in the game
[1:28:17] <SomersaultJustice> bye HP plus
[1:28:20] <rubbishbinge> HP plus is gone
[1:28:21] <+Lawxy> 7 BP to save half of a turn
[1:28:23] <%Ancopro> hp plus who needs it
[1:28:23] <stuffamiriteyea> time to raise bp on level up
[1:28:24] <+marumariball> its easily the best badge in the game
[1:28:25] <kingkeldeo31> Just get more BP
[1:28:25] <frigglefroogle> just wait on it honestly, until you level up again
[1:28:26] <+hawk_rush> happy flower and hp plus, i'd get rid of
[1:28:27] <%GokarioRoks> HP plus is waste honestly
[1:28:27] <Solidnick18> take hp plus off
[1:28:28] <Bguy32> Best Badge in the Game so worth it
[1:28:31] <bearking05> wait for level up
[1:28:32] <glass_marcus> Power bounce and hp plus can go
[1:28:34] <+ringabal> 10 HP RUN LETS GO
[1:28:37] <Gelphaze> Inventory time AWWW yea.
[1:28:39] <bbblaketwitching> Let's just start fighting
[1:28:41] <Bguy32> No It Will
[1:28:46] <%Supermonaman> Power bounce and HP plus.
[1:28:47] <+Sliverits> Hard disagree
[1:28:47] <%Ancopro> oke
[1:28:49] <+Quarkee> no it's literally the best thing that you can put in that slot
[1:28:49] <Am_Shigar00> Up to you.
[1:28:50] <%lewdskeletor13> BP Oil
[1:28:51] <+linSP> why have hp if you never get hit
[1:28:51] <@akuda_bar> it's fine yall
[1:28:52] <shiny_prinny> that's fair
[1:28:52] <+ckangaroo15k> You can only have 30 max.
[1:28:53] <tkuwari> you should get some more FP soon though
[1:28:53] <+Euphbugg> No it will super help
[1:28:53] <Papa_Bearman> This is about when I unequip Multibounce and never use it again.
[1:28:55] <dizimous> It will later for sure
[1:28:55] <@Menitta> DrinkPurple
[1:28:55] <+hawk_rush> power bounce is amazing, i'd never get rid of it
[1:28:56] <BlackermanZX> fair
[1:28:57] <frigglefroogle> its hos first run, no need to be optimal
[1:28:58] <+Lawxy> How is everybody this hype for quick change
[1:28:58] <vaderxyz1970> Build our pp back up
[1:28:58] <Bguy32> Quick Change is actually the Best though
[1:28:59] <RagnarokAM> I mean, you're wrong....but you do you man
[1:29:00] <%indigo_automaton> Reasonable
[1:29:01] <@akuda_bar> DrinkPurple
[1:29:01] <Cynical_Canadian> It's fine for now since there's so few partners, so you don't need to change too much yet
[1:29:03] <%lotharrio> Power Plus?!
[1:29:04] <+Grayhammatter> yep, just wait
[1:29:07] <redmage216> pretty lucky isn't bad
[1:29:08] <bbblaketwitching> I get it
[1:29:09] <%MayorRev> big bp, big pp
[1:29:12] <Am_Shigar00> I'd personally save for the power plus. Those are super good
[1:29:13] <kingkeldeo31> Pretty lucky
[1:29:17] <KasiCrafter> The Happy Basges are kind of like items in character action games; mor eof a crutch.
[1:29:17] <+Afterman_> yea its fine for noiw
[1:29:19] <Daniel_Is_I> Power Plus is also really good
[1:29:19] <bbblaketwitching> good for those who SLEEP
[1:29:23] <grimshuck> You won't be when enemies start hitting harder
[1:29:23] <Bguy32> Happy Flower and Pretty Lucky is good
[1:29:25] <+Zenryoku21> miss chance is godlike
[1:29:27] <theCoolChild> Have you found the use for the shine sprites yet?
[1:29:29] <rubbishbinge> pretty op
[1:29:30] <shiny_prinny> close call but forever
[1:29:31] <insaneintentionsyo> you have fp
[1:29:32] <%LuckyLagomorph> Peekaboo's good if you don't want to tattle, but then you miss out on Goombella dialogue
[1:29:32] <%lotharrio> Can you stack the regens?
[1:29:32] <Am_Shigar00> You do, but they stack
[1:29:34] <bevyrage> miss chance stacks with the danger lucky btw
[1:29:34] <%MonsterEnvy> FP
[1:29:34] <Daniel_Is_I> You have flower
[1:29:35] <+hawk_rush> you do
[1:29:35] <SixthSun2> Yes
[1:29:36] <%drewwartt> you have fp
[1:29:36] <%Proxzo> You can stack it
[1:29:37] <Potatoidea> Happy Flower
[1:29:38] <+Grayhammatter> you have both
[1:29:41] <bbblaketwitching> I hate Chill Out, as I have no chill
[1:29:42] <shiny_prinny> yes but they stack
[1:29:44] <nin10play> @theCoolChild Yeah he found Merlon and upgraded
[1:29:46] <BooitsDock> pretty lucky is nice to get
[1:29:48] <%Supermonaman> They stack.
[1:29:50] <Bguy32> Happy Flower is good
[1:29:54] <+ringabal> Stacks on stacks on stacks
[1:30:00] <Daniel_Is_I> Power Plusssss
[1:30:00] <+Lawxy> Woolie has had some amazing luck so far
[1:30:06] <+Lawxy> pretty lucky might be a good call
[1:30:07] <cocobody> !uptime
[1:30:07] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 30 minutes
[1:30:12] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Yes u are crazy
[1:30:17] <JetpackMcQuack> I want everything
[1:30:20] <+Grayhammatter> power plus is godlike for jump builds
[1:30:24] <Bguy32> Happy Heart P is pretty useless because you can just change partners
[1:30:24] <cocobody> What’d I miss lads?
[1:30:25] <Papa_Bearman> And you' can buy Chill Out with what's left.
[1:30:27] <+linSP> power is best number go up psaUp
[1:30:31] <Daniel_Is_I> Honestly I found happy heart/flower to be kinda bad
[1:30:34] <SixthSun2> Psst, Attack FX is one star piece but sells pretty good
[1:30:36] <The_Maddness> Does he know hes never going to have enough BP to Keep everything on?
[1:30:40] <+Lawxy> HHp
[1:30:44] <Papa_Bearman> You need three levels.
[1:30:46] <%krispen_wa> Woolie Versus Math
[1:30:48] <Am_Shigar00> So 3 level ups.
[1:30:49] <+Lawxy> is maybe not the best but hey
[1:30:53] <drewwartt> Math always wins
[1:30:54] <+Lawxy> this is how learning happens
[1:30:55] <CursedNobleman> @krispen_wa LUL
[1:30:57] <bevyrage> 300 star points needed to equip both without removing anything
[1:30:57] <@akuda_bar> @The_Maddness that's not correct
[1:30:58] <SomersaultJustice> ATTACK FX
[1:30:58] <bbblaketwitching> good
[1:31:00] <%lotharrio> I was just thinking that, @Grayhammatter. Since it increases his damage by 1, that means jump can do 4 damage, where as hammer can only do 3.
[1:31:01] <kingkeldeo31> You can't rely on the happy heart/flower IMO
[1:31:03] <+Sliverits> Woolie gonna hit that BP cap at like chapter 3
[1:31:05] <SixthSun2> FX can sell good coins @WoolieVersus
[1:31:10] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @ckangaroo15k
[1:31:13] <CursedNobleman> STONKS
[1:31:14] <KasiCrafter> Chill Out is pretty okay.
[1:31:16] <vaderxyz1970> Go To The Fortune Teller!!!
[1:31:17] <@akuda_bar> @ckangaroo15k that's not correct
[1:31:20] <redmage216> you could get a spell again if you wanted
[1:31:26] <@akuda_bar> the max is like 70 BP or even higher
[1:31:26] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:31:29] <benbag13> did tattle on the parlour boo
[1:31:30] <+GreenCMD> of yeah the spell
[1:31:35] <tkuwari> tattle on the boo?
[1:31:39] <kingkeldeo31> 50 bucks for Fortune
[1:31:41] <%lotharrio> Slip through those bars?
[1:31:42] <benbag13> did you tattle on the parlour boo
[1:31:42] <Curtis_64> @akuda_bar yeah the max is 99
[1:31:46] <milhousego> I would give my left nut for Nintendo to re-release this game and its prequel
[1:31:46] <@akuda_bar> yeah.
[1:31:49] <Bguy32> Quick Change kinda makes Happy Heart P irrelevant tbh. Instead of slow heals you can just change partners.
[1:31:50] <SomersaultJustice> he tattled the boo already
[1:31:50] <%Deepfriedhamster> big hosts
[1:31:53] <+hawk_rush> yeah, that's fair
[1:31:54] <insaneintentionsyo> she's great
[1:31:55] <bbblaketwitching> isnt he supposed to go to that left rougeport pipe?
[1:31:57] <%Ancopro> gottas save fo WAA
[1:31:58] <Nomad94> wasn't 30 max in Paper Mario 64?
[1:31:58] <shiny_prinny> yeah it's pricey
[1:32:00] <@akuda_bar> 70 is as high as you could normally get in a playthrough
[1:32:01] <Daniel_Is_I> @WoolieVersus The 50-coin one will last you like 4 chapters
[1:32:12] <@akuda_bar> damn you One Guy
[1:32:15] <missingangle> PUNI
[1:32:16] <Cynical_Canadian> There we go
[1:32:17] <+Lawxy> hello small being
[1:32:17] <tkuwari> I would give @milhousego 's right nut to get a rerelease of this game
[1:32:17] <+brickwall35> psa1guy
[1:32:18] <+ringabal> phew
[1:32:21] <Curtis_64> @Nomad94 yeah. that guy was just confused
[1:32:23] <+ckangaroo15k> @akuda_bar I was thinking of N64 mario
[1:32:24] <bbblaketwitching> I am the big wrong
[1:32:25] <kingkeldeo31> That's where the hidden block is
[1:32:29] <%Proxzo> Secret block here

[1:54:15] <+seoliart> Oh shit that's why
[1:54:19] <+ZoltanBMagnus> @Loinclothiclese oh man thanks. It sounded really similar and now I know why
[1:54:25] <%KoyFoster> This is Gansta? I normally skip OPs.
[1:54:26] <0nieladb> So I'm new here, what are the unwritten Twitch rules? Am I allowed to ask for tibia pics, or do you have to pay for those?

[1:57:27] <%Josef_Stryker> Nose thoroughly scratched?
[1:57:27] <+Quarkee> subscriptions pay the streamer half, Amazon gets the other half
[1:57:27] <jazzygrooves> @0nieladb following gives you notifications when the streamer goes live and they'll show up in your followed channels list, subscribing is paid and gives you emotes the streamer made, gives you fancy badge and removes ads from stream i think. A bit of the money goes to streamer iirc
[1:57:27] <+Loinclothiclese> @BlackMage66652 you talking about that garbage that just came out?

[2:16:51] <Cynical_Canadian> Get rid of the Happy badges
[2:16:53] <%MayorRev> QUAD DAMAGE
[2:16:54] <+Lawxy> if koops dad wasn't alive
[2:16:56] <bbblaketwitching> RAAAAGEEEEEE!!!!
[2:16:59] <%KyoryUtchy> You're gonna have to start making some hard choices
[2:17:00] <%GrassCannon> iirc it flips Koopas
[2:17:00] <%dinnydanny777> Q u a k e H a m m e r
[2:17:01] <+Lawxy> would they have had to cut hooktail apart to get the star
[2:17:02] <Am_Shigar00> It pierces the defense of hte Clefts.
[2:17:04] <tkuwari> Hes got the quakes thatll make you shake
[2:17:07] <Brutalyte616> "HAMMEEER!"
[2:17:10] <+AbnormalVoid> best hammer skill, pierces defence
[2:17:10] <SixthSun2> It flips koopas and clefts
[2:17:11] <+Jonesman64> it flips clefts I believe
[2:17:12] <%LionheartedRebel> ARMOR PIERCE
[2:17:12] <kingkeldeo31> Get rid of happy heart
[2:17:14] <trustedgundam13> Its basically a POW block
[2:17:16] <Papa_Bearman> It's an Earth attack.
[2:17:23] <The_Maddness> Replace something for it, it works on Klefts
[2:17:26] <Cynical_Canadian> Get rid of the Happy Badges and Timing Tutor
[2:17:26] <+kapcommunist> dont need timing tutor anymore right?
[2:17:27] <%dinnydanny777> It's a Quake
[2:17:29] <bbblaketwitching> that is a very good hammer
[2:17:30] <+Lawxy> happy heart only makes it harder to get danger mode
[2:17:32] <tkuwari> remove HP Plus
[2:17:32] <+Dimfish> FP based pow block
[2:17:33] <SomersaultJustice> take off happy heart
[2:17:34] <%lotharrio> Quick Change means you don't need both jump and hammer attacks.
[2:17:34] <%MonsterEnvy> Get damage dodge.
[2:17:43] <Davybot> just preplace the power hammer
[2:17:45] <rubbishbinge> quick change still mvp
[2:17:45] <KasiCrafter> Get rid of the Happys and stat boosts
[2:17:46] <Brutalyte616> Discount Earthbending attack.
[2:17:46] <+Grayhammatter> nice suggestion reggie
[2:17:48] <qsirius> HP plus is for chumps
[2:17:49] <kingkeldeo31> Dump the happy badges
[2:17:50] <bbblaketwitching> isnt there a button for that?
[2:17:51] <+agent_numa_lol> we have the technology
[2:17:55] <The_Maddness> And youre not USING timing tutor
[2:17:56] <%Ancopro> wipe the slate
[2:17:58] <+desfore> Take off HP plus
[2:18:00] <+ckangaroo15k> you don't need power bounce rn
[2:18:02] <+ringabal> psaHoldon
[2:18:04] <%lewdskeletor13> Amongst all the evil that the Boggly Woods can conjure, all the wickedness of Koopa-kind, we will send unto them, only you.
[2:18:04] <tkuwari> QUICK CHANGE IS SO GOOD
[2:18:05] <bbblaketwitching> I'd suggest doing the full thing
[2:18:05] <+Euphbugg> remove multibounce, it is very weak from this point on
[2:18:09] <glass_marcus> Get rid of power jump for sure
[2:18:11] <+AFrostyCookie> timing tutor DansGame
[2:18:11] <+pectusumbra> I'd say get rid of power bounce
[2:18:11] <%lewdskeletor13> Jump and hammer, until it is done
[2:18:12] <%lotharrio> Goombella has an equivalent to Multibounce and she does more base damage than you.
[2:18:15] <+Dimfish> you dont use power bounce anyways
[2:18:16] <+Zenryoku21> happy heart and flower can dip
[2:18:17] <RedoctoberWolf> how plus off and use level for hp
[2:18:17] <+pectusumbra> you haven't used it
[2:18:25] <kingkeldeo31> multi bounce
[2:18:26] <rubbishbinge> power jump is GONE
[2:18:33] <+gutlesscoward> Yeet power jump
[2:18:35] <%SirGO0SE> multibounce is hte bombfuckity
[2:18:35] <%MonsterEnvy> Goombella has the same power anyway
[2:18:39] <bbblaketwitching> I'd wait for Power Up for power bounce
[2:18:41] <Daniel_Is_I> Power Jump and Power Bounce are pointless to have together
[2:18:42] <The_Maddness> Close Call and Power Jump
[2:18:44] <+Dimfish> power jump doesnt get much play
[2:18:46] <Bguy32> Get rid of Power Jump
[2:18:48] <bbblaketwitching> it gets better as you do tho
[2:18:48] <Prevot> power bounce is way better than multibounce
[2:18:49] <Papa_Bearman> I'm surprised; I'm of the opposite mindset.
[2:18:51] <+KilogramHours> POWER JUMP
[2:18:55] <glass_marcus> power bounce is for when you've mastered the timings
[2:18:55] <+hi_imjams> Power bounce is the best boss killer
[2:18:55] <+ringabal> Prioritize passive badges
[2:18:57] <+Lawxy> no
[2:18:59] <%dinnydanny777> It's probably a good idea to think about what your party members can do too
[2:18:59] <%NopeBadguy> swap hp plus for fp plus, best defense is a good offense
[2:19:00] <The_Maddness> Good call
[2:19:03] <+RealThiele> Do not, my friends, become addicted to Max HPr. It will take hold of you, and you will resent its absence!
[2:19:05] <+KilogramHours> TAKE OUT POWER JUMP
[2:19:07] <+ItsDrwOk> Power bounce probably best move
[2:19:08] <+Lawxy> missing is 0 regular guard is only -1
[2:19:10] <Nyerp> isnt power bounce ridiculously good?
[2:19:14] <%SirGO0SE> good logic
[2:19:14] <Brutalyte616> Multibounce kind of sucks.
[2:19:14] <RedoctoberWolf> hammer build
[2:19:14] <kingkeldeo31> HP plus off
[2:19:16] <+Lawxy> unless you have the bravery to go for supers
[2:19:17] <tkuwari> take out hp plus plspls
[2:19:17] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Slattsquatch
[2:19:17] <Bguy32> Take Out Power Jump you've never Used
[2:19:18] <%Ancopro> have you used power jump?
[2:19:20] <Prevot> yeah power bounce is amazing
[2:19:20] <+Dimfish> you dont use power jumo
[2:19:22] <The_Maddness> lose Multiboounce
[2:19:25] <rubbishbinge> power bounce is toppest tier
[2:19:34] <bbblaketwitching> seems like a QUICK CHANGE
[2:19:37] <GodlyLuigi> power bounce is good if you're good with it but this is old man woolie
[2:19:37] <Bguy32> ooh 1 more and you can get Quick Change
[2:19:40] <%NopeBadguy> power bounce is also amazing, you played mario rpg, you know @WoolieVersus
[2:19:40] <+desfore> Power bounce is good, but for right now, you can leave it
[2:19:42] <%Juicce> Happies out
[2:19:43] <+pectusumbra> it's good but it's when you need it
[2:19:46] <+Euphbugg> no shells here
[2:19:49] <bbblaketwitching> really you got the room my dude
[2:19:49] <%Ancopro> power bouince will be good later on
[2:19:50] <kingkeldeo31> Multi bounce does 1 damage
[2:19:51] <rubbishbinge> but you don't have the timing yet, so don't worry about bounce
[2:19:52] <+ckangaroo15k> Power bounce is almost worthless at this point.
[2:19:52] <The_Maddness> there arent koopas here
[2:19:52] <%MonsterEnvy> Goombella has power bounce
[2:19:54] <glass_marcus> power bounce for later guys
[2:19:55] <%lotharrio> Diferent targetting with Koops.
[2:19:56] <RedoctoberWolf> power bound is most damage when you get the badges
[2:19:58] <Prevot> multibounce is a waste if if only does 1 damage
[2:19:58] <Bguy32> Power Bounce is great. it maybe you can leave it for now
[2:19:59] <+Masamune195> Koops is your multibounce
[2:20:00] <thetntm> Multibounce only deals 1 damage and isn't enough to kill anything
[2:20:01] <%MonsterEnvy> Damage Dodge
[2:20:02] <%SirGO0SE> the real thousand year door is the badges screen
[2:20:02] <+worldbrand> rekooped
[2:20:05] <+Loinclothiclese> Re Kooped
[2:20:06] <missingangle> You can change any of this at any time. if you think you need power bounce later on, you can change things around again.
[2:20:09] <+desfore> Power bounce ain't that great at this point in the game
[2:20:15] <%NopeBadguy> @WoolieVersus you could take off the hp plus and get quick change
[2:20:15] <+Lawxy> damage dodge is real good
[2:20:17] <Am_Shigar00> 2 2 2 would be good
[2:20:19] <Papa_Bearman> I'd recommend sorting this list regularly.
[2:20:20] <tkuwari> multibounce is really only useful against flying koopas and goombas
[2:20:20] <+MeMillionthDollar> 1000 Door with 1000 viewers!
[2:20:20] <+RealThiele> -2 damage ona dodge sounds sick
[2:20:21] <+Slattsquatch> ReKOOPed
[2:20:21] <%MonsterEnvy> You guard all the time
[2:20:22] <Bguy32> YOU ALWAYS GUARS
[2:20:26] <+Lawxy> YOU GUARD ALWAYS
[2:20:26] <rubbishbinge> what
[2:20:27] <SomersaultJustice> LUL
[2:20:27] <Solidnick18> then fp plus
[2:20:28] <thetntm> woolie no
[2:20:28] <Bguy32> That the block
[2:20:29] <+Lawxy> EVERY ENEMY ACTION
[2:20:30] <+VorpalSlash> You guard every attack
[2:20:30] <+Grayhammatter> you ALWAYS guard woolie
[2:20:31] <+BestTeaMaker> woolie learn to guard lol
[2:20:31] <RedoctoberWolf> all in royal
[2:20:32] <Daniel_Is_I> GUARD IS THE A PRESS WOOLIE
[2:20:33] <dreadedcthulhu> it means parry/block
[2:20:34] <+ringabal> NOT DEFENSE, GUARD
[2:20:34] <%GrassCannon> Guard not Defend Woolie
[2:20:34] <thetntm> GUARD MEANS THE ACTION COMMAND
[2:20:35] <bbblaketwitching> GUARD IS THE ACTION COMMAND
[2:20:36] <%baronblank> no woolie, it means the guard command when being attacked
[2:20:37] <%GokarioRoks> Woolie Why? LUL
[2:20:38] <Am_Shigar00> @WoolieVersus Damage dodge is for the A block
[2:20:38] <Bguy32> Woolie no that's the the A PRESS
[2:20:38] <%lotharrio> Action command, Woolie. Not Defend.
[2:20:39] <%Ancopro> he tries to parry tho so gaurding to him is a punishment
[2:20:40] <%pkdragoon> guard is not the same as defend
[2:20:40] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1275210654773915649?s=20
[2:20:40] <GodlyLuigi> woolie guarding with this will make you nigh invincible at this point if you actually guarded lol
[2:20:42] <Brutalyte616> Actually Damage Dodge is strong.
[2:20:44] <%lewdskeletor13> woolieDATTEBAYO
[2:20:46] <+RealThiele> lame
[2:20:47] <+KilogramHours> ACTION COMMAND
[2:20:48] <+Lawxy> thank you reggie
[2:20:51] <+Lawxy> you're a hero
[2:20:51] <SomersaultJustice> guard is when you press A before you get hurt
[2:20:55] <%Supermonaman> You are always supposed to guard.
[2:20:55] <tkuwari> Based Reggie
[2:20:55] <%SirGO0SE> REGGIE THE HERO
[2:20:56] <%NopeBadguy> @WoolieVersus you're one away from quick change if you want to swap between goombella and koops quick
[2:20:58] <+GreenCMD> damage dodge, quake, and swap power jump with power bounce
[2:20:58] <Bguy32> GUARD ACTION COMMAND
[2:20:59] <TheLemuroid> Hitting A with timing
[2:20:59] <%GrassCannon> +1 Defense on Block
[2:21:02] <+KilogramHours> THATS REALLY GOOD
[2:21:04] <Rhinoprotoss> Literally says action command
[2:21:04] <bbblaketwitching> DrinkPurple DrinkPurple
[2:21:05] <%dinnydanny777> Guard is the action command of blocking not the command of defence
[2:21:07] <Bguy32> Reggie the hero
[2:21:08] <Daniel_Is_I> So you reduce incoming damage by 2 instead of 1
[2:21:08] <+KilogramHours> DAMAGE DODGE IS VERY GOOD
[2:21:11] <%Juicce> Reggie the LoreMaster
[2:21:11] <andrex2311> R.E.G System at work!
[2:21:12] <+Grayhammatter> it's basically royal guard level 2
[2:21:14] <+KilogramHours> REGGIE CAN READ
[2:21:15] <+Euphbugg> and the universe thanks you Reggie
[2:21:18] <grimshuck> Thank you Reggie
[2:21:21] <%Ancopro> yea
[2:21:23] <+ringabal> Now if Woolie could actually block...
[2:21:24] <%kyh9> Reggie the chat prophet
[2:21:26] <%dinnydanny777> Wow I put that poorly
[2:21:28] <%lewdskeletor13> Bless you R.E.G
[2:21:29] <%Supermonaman> It says it.
[2:21:30] <%NopeBadguy> i would say take off happy heart p and go for fp plus instead @WoolieVersus
[2:21:32] <Solidnick18> just test it
[2:21:32] <%SirGO0SE> the R.E.G. system = Read Every Guy/Gal
[2:21:33] <%Ancopro> you'll see
[2:21:33] <+Lawxy> it doubles your dodge
[2:21:35] <+ckangaroo15k> Action command means the pressing of the buttons
[2:21:37] <Leddy_at_Home> It literally says Action Command
[2:21:39] <+Lawxy> your defense*
[2:21:40] <Prevot> it literally says ACTION command
[2:21:41] <bbblaketwitching> ...
[2:21:41] <thetntm> action commands are the things you do during attacks
[2:21:42] <+Lawxy> ignore my failure words
[2:21:44] <Bguy32> ACTION COMMAND has always been the Commands
[2:21:46] <+KilogramHours> Reggie's ability to read is paramount
[2:21:46] <%baronblank> action command means timed button press
[2:21:53] <%GrassCannon> tbf Defend is an action you can take
[2:21:57] <%MonsterEnvy> Actions Commands are the timed button presses
[2:21:57] <%SirGO0SE> shu shu shu
[2:21:58] <%JohnAtDawn> That time the enemy got SSS
[2:21:59] <SomersaultJustice> Read no Jutsu
[2:22:00] <+ringabal> HAYAI
[2:22:01] <bbblaketwitching> I'm not buying that excuse ere
[2:22:07] <%Supermonaman> That was sick.
[2:22:08] <%SirGO0SE> GAZELLE PUNCH
[2:22:12] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> SMAAASHUU
[2:22:20] <Bguy32> They've used a room command for the same thing all game and you still misread it NotLikeThis
[2:22:21] <kingkeldeo31> WHY
[2:22:21] <SomersaultJustice> LUL
[2:22:21] <bbblaketwitching> DrinkPurple
[2:22:23] <rubbishbinge> why care about ippo when sendo exists
[2:22:24] <%dinnydanny777> That cloud was furious
[2:22:24] <+KilogramHours> NO DAMAGE
[2:22:25] <+pleadv> The way the animate the Smash is ridiculous. He skates across the ground
[2:22:30] <The_Maddness> not even one
[2:22:34] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> The LOOK AWAY
[2:22:37] <GodlyLuigi> Upgraded goombella regular jump attack does 4 damage now i believe
[2:22:38] <bbblaketwitching> he pick the right one this time but whiffed anyways lol
[2:22:39] <+TheOneCalledRock> wait chat. does woolie know about the parry?
[2:22:44] <glass_marcus> the look away is the hottest play in the anime
[2:22:45] <thetntm> he does
[2:22:45] <jorniev> LOOK AWAY
[2:22:46] <%SirGO0SE> ippo and his big donger rule
[2:22:46] <+KilogramHours> @TheOneCalledRock Yes
[2:22:47] <+Grayhammatter> he does
[2:22:48] <+TheOneCalledRock> ok
[2:22:51] <bbblaketwitching> he may have forgotten
[2:22:55] <The_Maddness> its faster
[2:22:55] <rubbishbinge> he not gonna bother with 3 frames
[2:22:58] <+pleadv> The Look Away is Aokki's crowning achievement
[2:22:59] <+KilogramHours> @TheOneCalledRock The parry is harder to hit
[2:23:03] <tkuwari> The Look Away is the strongest movie in all of anime
[2:23:07] <Brutalyte616> Goombella has a second stylish command when she lands.
[2:23:08] <bbblaketwitching> he does "know" though
[2:23:12] <+Euphbugg> ABUSE NATURE FOR PRIZES
[2:23:15] <+TheOneCalledRock> i understand that lmao, that parry timing is nuts
[2:23:24] <The_Maddness> its behind the fence
[2:23:25] <bbblaketwitching> in as much as lp'ers know things
[2:23:26] <tkuwari> Even the reader will look away when Aoki wills it
[2:23:26] <+Jonesman64> the parry is real hard to hit
[2:23:29] <%SirGO0SE> FLURRIE <3
[2:23:31] <%SirGO0SE> BAEEE
[2:23:45] <+desfore> Sure

[2:24:24] <+Lawxy> you just paid seven for a heal
[2:24:24] <Bguy32> Use more items woolie
[2:24:26] <tkuwari> at some point you must use your items
[2:24:27] <bbblaketwitching> Inn coupooonnn
[2:24:28] <andrex2311> Volta Shrrom!
[2:24:28] <kingkeldeo31> The game is actively telling you: USE ITEMS
[2:24:29] <+Lawxy> inn coupon saves 5
[2:24:30] <+RealThiele> mystery gonna stay a mystery until end of the game
[2:24:31] <+TheOneCalledRock> you can always get it bacl
[2:24:32] <%Superbro64> SeriousSloth
[2:24:32] <Papa_Bearman> I'd say leave the Volt Shroom until later.
[2:24:32] <bbblaketwitching> ze trashhh
[2:24:33] <+KilogramHours> @WoolieVersus You need to store your items Woolie
[2:24:35] <Prevot> you should just store that Inn COupon
[2:24:37] <%Supermonaman> Jesus Christ use items my guy.
[2:24:45] <Am_Shigar00> Oh yeah, that inn coupon's dissapearing for good
[2:24:49] <%NopeBadguy> @WoolieVersus here's a way to conquer mindgoblins, if you lose items due to a full inventory, that's ultimately a greater loss of better items
[2:24:50] <bbblaketwitching> You obviously need to USE items
[2:24:54] <%lotharrio> Or sell them.
[2:24:55] <tkuwari> DMC has ruined items in woolie's mind
[2:24:58] <Bguy32> You only have 10 Slots and this game throws items at you constantly
[2:25:01] <%SirGO0SE> denim reggie is a good mood
[2:25:03] <Bguy32> Just use them
[2:25:06] <frigglefroogle> yeah, you gotta unlearn not using items, no item is super rare
[2:25:09] <+RowenCleric> dont use items you may need them later dont listen to people
[2:25:17] <bbblaketwitching> ITEMS DONT DECREASE STYLE
[2:25:19] <+Jonesman64> why use when you can horde?
[2:25:26] <%MayorRev> "walk" lmao
[2:25:29] <%Superbro64> @rowencleric your crazy
[2:25:31] <SomersaultJustice> don't psaGoblin your items woolz
[2:25:32] <ingman112> Hoard
[2:25:33] <+GreenCMD> save the items. t. brain goblins
[2:25:34] <%lotharrio> Yeah, horde them on the ground for rats to eat.
[2:25:37] <vaderxyz1970> Oh are you nude?
[2:25:40] <%Superbro64> hoarding items does nothing
[2:25:41] <kingkeldeo31> Imagine not using items
[2:25:41] <Am_Shigar00> That's generally why they put heal blocks right next to save points
[2:25:47] <bbblaketwitching> I mean, she basically is

[2:52:52] <Prevot> that's not what grounded means woolie
[2:52:53] <%NopeBadguy> @WoolieVersus it's not grounded for the purpose of quake hammer or power block, but it is for melee
[2:52:54] <+desfore> Koops is not a ground attack
[2:52:56] <MrBorisMakarov> one guy atpRtsd
[2:52:56] <tkuwari> Its floating so earth based attack wouldnt work
[2:52:57] <Cynical_Canadian> It's low to the ground, but it's not grounded
[2:52:59] <CelestialCage> @woolieversus koops and hammer can hit it but quake hammer wont hit it
[2:53:02] <%indigo_automaton> A grounded cloud is just lightning
[2:53:02] <+天使42199> atpRtsd
[2:53:03] <+ckangaroo15k> That wasn't a ground attack.
[2:53:06] <+desfore> No
[2:53:07] <thetntm> it's ground level but it's not grounded
[2:53:08] <%ozmon> It's "levitating"
[2:53:08] <%Superbro64> chat SeriousSloth
[2:53:08] <%Th3SmartAlec> we thought he was going to use Quake Hammer
[2:53:09] <The_Maddness> No
[2:53:10] <tkuwari> It is a pedantic difference
[2:53:12] <Bguy32> Grounded means hittable by Quakes
[2:53:12] <%SuperKirby24> LUL
[2:53:13] <bbblaketwitching> please use pow in place of a quake hammer
[2:53:13] <The_Maddness> Youre wrong woolie
[2:53:15] <Cynical_Canadian> It's like Pokemon
[2:53:17] <Brutalyte616> Woolie needs to work on those double stylishes. Or do you need a badge for that.
[2:53:18] <+BlumpyLumpkins> the game has a difference between "low" and "on the ground"
[2:53:20] <%YakumoYomi> It wasn't "grounded", though. It was low enough for Koops, but doesn't count for moves like Quake Hammer.
[2:53:20] <+desfore> It's not "Grounded" like for POW Blocks. no
[2:53:22] <Bguy32> That Cloud is not hittable by Quakes
[2:53:25] <+AbnormalVoid> when the clouds are low, they can be hit with anything but quake
[2:53:26] <CelestialCage> Yeah there's low amd grounded
[2:53:29] <missingangle> Hmm, low on the ground, but not necessarily grounded.
[2:53:30] <SideChar> it was grayed out
[2:53:30] <%NopeBadguy> @WoolieVersus it's not grounded for the purpose of quake hammer or power block, but it is for melee
[2:53:31] <%Javaa01> Yeah, they're low right now, so Quake doesn't hit
[2:53:34] <Nomad94> fair
[2:53:36] <tkuwari> That is correct
[2:53:36] <%heartlesshealer> You can hammer, but you cannot Quake
[2:53:37] <CurrySauseBandit> It's fog.
[2:53:38] <Daniel_Is_I> Clouds change elevation
[2:53:39] <+RealThiele> there write, clouds grounded
[2:53:40] <Bguy32> It means no Quakes
[2:53:40] <Am_Shigar00> Yeah, basically confusion in terminology.
[2:53:41] <%GrassCannon> You can't earthquake a pokemon with Levitate
[2:53:41] <thetntm> we thought you meant quake hammer
[2:53:43] <JetpackMcQuack> I think the important thing is it doesn’t matter
[2:53:43] <CelestialCage> @woolieversus Oh we thought you were gonna hit it with quake. sorry
[2:53:45] <Cynical_Canadian> Yes to shell, no to Quake
[2:53:45] <Thunderhog> @WoolieVersus yeah grounded is only important for quake moves
[2:53:50] <%GrassCannon> You can cross chop it though
[2:53:51] <The_Maddness> oh, then youre corect
[2:53:51] <+AbnormalVoid> it can be hit with earth tremor, though, cause earth tremor has verticality
[2:53:53] <Potatoidea> We are no longer chat, we are the universe PogChamp
[2:53:55] <Thunderhog> Ground LEVEL is a different deal
[2:53:57] <+paladinstarbuster> sbfpMember
[2:53:59] <grimshuck> Quake only hits those touching the ground
[2:54:01] <%GokarioRoks> grounded as in quake not working, but Woolie didn't meant that
[2:54:06] <bbblaketwitching> all I mean is that he can save FP by using pow block instead
[2:54:11] <%dinnydanny777> I'm the Universe :)
[2:54:12] <Nomad94> I'm so mad I beat this game without ever learning about Stylish moves
[2:54:12] <Bguy32> Earth Tremor always hits everything if your good
[2:54:13] <Gelphaze> YEA that's grounded.
[2:54:14] <bbblaketwitching> thats all I'm sayin
[2:54:15] <thetntm> woolie but will thunder cross split attack hit it if it has the pickle stone equipped

[3:34:38] <SpaceLTN> DrinkPurple
[3:34:39] <rubbishbinge> HP Drain, drains 5 hp from enemy
[3:34:40] <nin10play> It's an item that hurts an enemy and heals you for 5
[3:34:40] <thetntm> you have to hold and release with the image
[3:34:40] <pookam> so you gotta watch the button prompt at the top of the meter and hold A ONLY when it's pressed

[3:58:56] <%Jack8274> Oh dear
[3:58:59] <thetntm> woolie remember goombella's standard attack deals 4 base damage
[3:59:00] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:59:13] <+ringabal> @WoolieVersus Don't worry about Multibonk's stylish
[3:59:19] <thetntm> so only multibonk if you need to deal like 7 or more
[3:59:21] <dreadedcthulhu> multi is line I think
[3:59:25] <shiny_prinny> it can be kinda tough
[3:59:34] <The_Maddness> Multibonk is faster
[3:59:37] <shiny_prinny> i think the frames are tighter
[3:59:42] <The_Maddness> The commands come faster
[3:59:50] <Drusain> you'll get it woolie \o/
[3:59:54] <%Ancopro> yea its faster timing
[3:59:57] <trustedgundam13> Its a little delay based I think, over time it also gets harder.
[3:59:58] <%NopeBadguy> @WoolieVersus Both multibounce and multibonk have their frame windows decrease as you get further on. I believe they also cap at about ten or so.

[4:14:04] <bbblaketwitching> theres differing resistances between enemies, you were mostly unlucky
[4:14:04] <bevyrage> blow only doesn't work on boss characters. it works on everything else if you blow hard enough though

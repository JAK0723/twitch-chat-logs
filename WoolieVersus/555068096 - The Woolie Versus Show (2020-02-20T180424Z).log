[0:07:57] <worldbrand> Woolie Versus Shootbangs
[0:08:10] <%Solidnick18> i never finished vanquish but i'm excited

[0:10:03] <noobpsyboticus> man I can't wait for eternal
[0:10:04] <%gatorafan> Woolie did finish Doom, you might still be crazy tho daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:10:08] <platinumgamersamgideon> Vanquish is a really good game
[0:10:24] <platinumgamersamgideon> PlatinumGames is a great developer and Sam Gideon is a cool character.
[0:10:29] <$Chumblago13> Bayo and Vanquish had their 10yr anniversary 2 days ago so the games are now on Xbone and Ps4 individually and bundled together
[0:10:33] <%Solidnick18> oh wow 6 to 8 hours to beat yeah that is pretty short
[0:10:36] <+Shotgundam009> wooliePOYO
[0:10:37] <Varadox> Squid boy Woolie is cursed.
[0:10:37] <noobpsyboticus> the retro shooter resurgence warms my cockles
[0:10:37] <Morning_Asakura> @platinumgamersamgideon my favorite name i've seen on twitch
[0:10:39] <@Menitta> One thing that I don't like about Vanquish is how the melee depletes meter entirely
[0:10:44] <Tucker0603> he did Doom yesterday?!?
[0:10:45] <platinumgamersamgideon> @morning_asakura good
[0:10:46] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> yeah its short
[0:10:47] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Greetings, humans
[0:10:53] <%Solidnick18> Doom was tuesday
[0:10:54] <MayorRev> DOOT
[0:10:57] <@Menitta> Itd be too easy otherwise but still
[0:10:59] <Tucker0603> ahhh
[0:11:03] <+Shotgundam009> ULTRAAAAAAAAAAAA
[0:11:03] <platinumgamersamgideon> Sam Gideon > Master Chief
[0:11:04] <Morning_Asakura> i wish melee was more viable in vanquish too
[0:11:09] <%Louie_Salmon> YEYEYEYEYE
[0:11:09] <MayorRev> DOOT that flute
[0:11:17] <platinumgamersamgideon> @morning_asakura it was supposed to be
[0:11:20] <%gatorafan> no, last night was KOTOR's lightside (later) run
[0:11:25] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> So what are you people up to?
[0:11:25] <@Menitta> The best Melee is the heavy machine gun one
[0:11:29] <Morning_Asakura> melee into ar feels so good tho
[0:11:31] <+Shotgundam009> Drugs
[0:11:32] <@Menitta> just flip up in the air
[0:11:33] <fist_wizard_jay> ULTRAAAAAA
[0:11:54] <platinumgamersamgideon> @menitta I like doing the flip with out hitting anything to get AR mode behind cover
[0:11:56] <+Zimpirate> That wasn't very Plus Ultra of you :O
[0:11:56] <%Solidnick18> wooliePOYO
[0:12:04] <@Menitta> That one is good to whiff if you're not behind cover so you can get aerial slowmo
[0:12:07] <@Menitta> yeye
[0:12:12] <gamecontroller25> first time to the stream, what should I expected
[0:12:19] <+Psycosis> i knew woolie was going to play this again
[0:12:27] <%Louie_Salmon> I'll be honest, played about half of this, then got discouraged because I hadn't been optimal with the gun upgrade system. It's probably high time I go at it again. It's just so cool
[0:12:27] <Varadox> Full throated hard Rs.
[0:12:30] <+NotHereToStream> yeyeye
[0:12:32] <Tucker0603> YEYEYEYEYEYEYEYEYE
[0:12:32] <platinumgamersamgideon> yes flip kick wiff into AR is very viable

[0:38:30] <Tucker0603> what was the orange machine gun called again?
[0:38:33] <Dakuu75> OOOOHHH, Jak 2 Morph Gun, nice
[0:38:34] <arikk42> Blade = Gun
[0:38:36] <%RioGascar> tho maybe not vanquish on switch
[0:38:37] <Xeroflame> boost?
[0:38:39] <stranger59> The Blade system from the launch 360
[0:38:43] <@Menitta> Boost Machine gun
[0:38:44] <Ganfur> I never realized that

[0:38:58] <Malucoblz02> Buy this anniversary bundçe, show Platinum all consoles are worth it.
[0:39:00] <Tucker0603> ah yes, the boost machine gun is my favorite
[0:39:09] <JudgeDAN> Holy shit yes vanquish!
[0:39:10] <jorniev> the only thing i can se this game improving is if somehow they added verticallity
[0:39:13] <@Menitta> Vanquish isn't on Switch. but if it WAS you KNOW thered be a Varia suit skin
[0:39:19] <kevinwager> @SliverFaustX fuck the new Xbox and PS4 there with that Cloud gaming stuff
[0:39:20] <Morning_Asakura> woolie with good tips
[0:39:21] <%DatAsuna> BUT only if it had full ammo. So you can't upgrade when you have less than full
[0:39:25] <%ozzrabbit> I'm a big fan of both the "transforming weapon" and the "evolving weapon" tropes
[0:39:26] <%FuqBoiSlim> i love when weapons have multiple forms
[0:39:28] <%RioGascar> adding verticallity

[1:00:52] <Jalexster> Because this includes all the DLC
[1:00:52] <+Worsel5> Big tip is to go crazy and dont play it like Gears of War for anyone playing the first time. it's a blast
[1:00:53] <absolute_cagemony> If Woolie is gonna play more shooters, he needs to think of a title for it
[1:00:55] <%Solidnick18> uh oh

[1:00:57] <Tucker0603> BOOST MACHINE GUN

[1:03:05] <%gatorafan> LP OFF TO A GOOD START
[1:03:06] <Toaster_Noodle> That really sucks
[1:03:08] <jarednotwithsubway> !EYES AT RISK!
[1:03:09] <+tankusmaximus7> Oh dear
[1:03:09] <+huggablemantooth> coloblind??
[1:03:14] <kevinwager> he color blind?

[1:03:15] <FairOnFire> enemies are all robots though
[1:03:15] <%Ipsenscastle> I'm colourblind and I have a real fucking hard time with Vanquish
[1:03:16] <+huggablemantooth> color*
[1:03:16] <vVAstrAVv> maybe Reggie should play lol
[1:03:16] <Teh10sorrow> Oh right Min is legit colorblind when it comes to red
[1:03:16] <stranger59> Are there colorblind options on this?
[1:03:17] <wotebi> off to a bad start
[1:03:22] <gordieda20> uh oh
[1:03:22] <brunoberserk> OOF
[1:03:25] <Jathspuh> good luck minh! atpQuan
[1:03:25] <Xeroflame> that sucks bro
[1:03:27] <jarednotwithsubway> Minh is in fact red green colorblind
[1:03:27] <Solidus0101> Minheggan in full effect
[1:03:28] <+theotherkristian> Robots=Communists
[1:03:28] <Teh10sorrow> This is going to be AAAAAAAAAMAZING with him murdering friendlies
[1:03:29] <Toaster_Noodle> That is a pretty big thing too
[1:03:31] <%gatorafan> Everyone is an enemy to Minh
[1:03:31] <absolute_cagemony> Of to a rollicking good start!
[1:03:32] <dmc5nero> wait your really colorbliind?
[1:03:35] <+linSP> minh is blind to communism!
[1:03:36] <thesoothe> Coloblindness didn't exist for the PS3 /Xbox 360 era.
[1:03:37] <Zebroneath> Minh is colorblind to certain colors
[1:03:42] <donstylo> Here is the Deal, every Weapon has a military Rank, like Sergeant. Everytime you pick up the same weapon your weapon gets a new rank, only if you have full ammo, otherwise it only fills your ammo. Picking up the same weapons is basicly the upgradesystem. If you die your weapons lose ranks.
[1:03:51] <dmc5nero> what game has color blind options?
[1:03:55] <+mickers> shame u cant choose retical colours
[1:03:55] <zamzoph> Woolie and Reggie are going to have to be Minh's spotters
[1:03:57] <joylent_blue> a game nowadays would maybe have an option but not, what, '09? LUL
[1:04:08] <%Ipsenscastle> @dmc5nero lots have since around 2010
[1:04:10] <kevinwager> u better pay for those Google 4k glasses
[1:04:16] <nothuzad> but colorblindness doesnt take away hue so the enemies should still be identifieable by shape (well after a few minutes)
[1:04:21] <+Worsel5> Daemon X Machina is my worst nightmare, no colorblind options and I cant see ANYTHING in that game
[1:04:25] <vVAstrAVv> do weapon ranks reset each level?
[1:04:25] <katocrimson> There's a company that make color blind corrective glasses
[1:04:27] <%FuqBoiSlim> this came out in 2010
[1:04:36] <Tucker0603> heal the dudes
[1:04:37] <masterfire23> colorblind to certain colors cmonBruh
[1:04:45] <+theotherkristian> No there's friendly fire
[1:04:48] <dmc5nero> literally the 10th anniversary
[1:04:52] <+Worsel5> @katocrimson yes and they are pretty expensive :)
[1:04:55] <absolute_cagemony> 2010? wasn't everything black and white back then?
[1:05:08] <nothuzad> absolute_cagemony more like piss filtered
[1:05:12] <%RioGascar> more like grey and brown cover shooter
[1:05:13] <Jathspuh> SSS
[1:05:13] <Valdorick> "That there's no friendly fire" - Blasts 3 of his own guys, who die instantly.
[1:05:18] <pshuuu> age of brown
[1:05:18] <absolute_cagemony> Reggie's favorite. Piss.
[1:05:19] <%Javaa01> It was more piss yellow and brown
[1:05:20] <Andrei11Droasca> This makes me want a Star Wars Platinum game
[1:05:25] <Valdorick> Confirmed Friendly KIAs!
[1:05:28] <+Proxzo> Has Minh tried those special glasses that restore color sight?
[1:05:30] <+RoughyID> Did anyone tell him that picking the same weapons upgrades that wewapon?
[1:05:38] <%RioGascar> Which i dont really like this games color scheme
[1:05:49] <%RioGascar> but its visuals and art direction are solid
[1:05:49] <+mickers> man this is very unfortuante that everything is green/red
[1:05:52] <Malucoblz02> @RoughyID yes it was mentioned
[1:05:55] <dmc5nero> imagine if they made a marvel platinum game that would be awesome
[1:05:59] <+RoughyID> okay nice
[1:06:01] <%gatorafan> I sure hope Minh can see the green/red overheat bar. daedra1DerpyTibs
[1:06:03] <kevinwager> @karldeck then that should be the stream goal hlep him get the glasses to see donashion G
[1:06:13] <+Jaysky> Look to Resident Evil 5's color palette to get an idea of most games colors back in 2010
[1:06:19] <+Proxzo> They sell Chroma Glasses that restore color sight within a certain range.
[1:06:19] <arikk42> OoooOOoOOOooOOoOOoOOF
[1:06:26] <%FuqBoiSlim> the tps genre started with vanquish
[1:06:33] <jarednotwithsubway> @Proxzo but he needs glasses already, he would need contacts, or lenses that are prescription as well as colorblind aiding
[1:06:36] <Jathspuh> strats PogChamp
[1:06:43] <Andrei11Droasca> Chest Lasers coming up woolieYE
[1:06:50] <kevinwager> @proxzo we should donate

[1:07:12] <Jathspuh> LUL
[1:07:17] <+Proxzo> I wonder if you could get the Chroma glasses prescription?
[1:07:20] <worldbrand> SO YES
[1:07:21] <+theotherkristian> nvr mind I'm forgetting
[1:07:22] <dmc5nero> wtf was that?!

[1:20:39] <joylent_blue> Mrthefro i'm sure he can, he just sees greens as reds i believe? or vice versa
[1:20:42] <+RoughyID> No, its just that if you're out of boost you're basically out of armor power, and you get really vulnerable.
[1:20:46] <zenith0111> I thought there was a coloblind option in the menu

[1:42:08] <Kyopheonix> @scoopyoopydoo u rite
[1:42:08] <%Taglog7> BIG TIP
[1:42:08] <+Psycosis> thye are jetstream sam
[1:42:09] <spacecatstreams> neat
[1:42:15] <+TheDankDemon> can't wait for the second game Kappa
[1:42:24] <scoopyoopydoo> his name sam too
[1:42:25] <%FuqBoiSlim> @valachi Vanquish 2
[1:42:35] <Jolly_Adventurer> Mutiny Avoided
[1:42:37] <scoopyoopydoo> Platinum hella self inserted their character into metal gear
[1:43:02] <+Psycosis> RELOAD CANCELS?
[1:43:08] <Xeroflame> passive reload
[1:43:11] <jorniev> REALOAD CANCELLING!!!??
[1:43:15] <KnivesEve> is this a non-woolie lp!? nice
[1:43:18] <+RoughyID> woooooow
[1:43:22] <%Taglog7> tech on tech on tech
[1:43:24] <+NotHereToStream> jfc thats a platinum thing
[1:43:24] <scoopyoopydoo> on some source game shit
[1:43:25] <arikk42> I Never Knew That X4
[1:43:33] <%jiggy_snipe> naw with Platinum it's a feature
[1:43:35] <+RoughyID> Didn't know that x4
[1:43:46] <+TheDankDemon> why tho sounds stressful
[1:43:50] <donstylo> A little Detail, you only have one weapon that can copy any other weapon.
[1:43:59] <Xeroflame> do all of it in ar mode
[1:44:27] <Andrei11Droasca> Its like the DMC animation cancels
[1:44:55] <%FuqBoiSlim> animation cancelling is a staple in platinum games. I bet even Infinite Space has cancels too and that's not even an action game
[1:44:58] <%Taglog7> LUL
[1:44:58] <valentinevergil> like canceling a long arrack with Royal guard
[1:45:02] <+D00msDayDan> @woolieversus it’s not a reload cancel, switching weapons reloads automatically
[1:45:07] <valentinevergil> attack*
[1:45:07] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:45:08] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Very cool
[1:45:15] <mr_miyagichu> I think some shooters have stuff like this like cod and speinting to cancel reloads right?
[1:45:23] <absolute_cagemony> If Platinum made an RTS it would have animation cancels
[1:45:27] <astrophizz> reload cancelling is in fps's
[1:45:32] <%Javaa01> CoD has partial reload cancelling
[1:45:38] <astrophizz> counterstrike
[1:45:40] <Manwad> Build queue cancels Pog
[1:45:41] <mr_miyagichu> Ah ok
[1:45:49] <Xeroflame> so then it is a passive reload instead of a cancel
[1:45:51] <Jathspuh> yeah counterstrike
[1:45:52] <%Javaa01> Where basically once the mag hits the gun, you can sprint cancel the reload and it counts
[1:46:00] <DedlokPM> Reaper in Overwatch has (had?) reload canceling
[1:46:03] <eldragon_1> That Steve Blum?
[1:46:17] <%jiggy_snipe> lol
[1:46:19] <DedlokPM> @eldragon_1 yeah
[1:46:27] <bleugh> epic drop PogChamp
[1:46:38] <%jiggy_snipe> Woolie doesn't under this RPG Shlooter color stuff Kappa
[1:46:44] <%FuqBoiSlim> it's like upgrading weapons in something like metal slugs huh
[1:46:56] <+olgaflowen> You guys playing this game reminded me that it came out. Probably one of the better PS3 games that released that went under the radar.
[1:47:00] <%Javaa01> Most characters in Overwatch had reload cancels, Reaper's was just the most powerful one, since it basically cut the reload in half
[1:47:33] <%Taglog7> AMERICA
[1:47:37] <+TheDankDemon> fallout has that LUL
[1:47:45] <Xeroflame> played college ball you know
[1:47:51] <%DatAsuna> Sam was Homo-Football
[1:47:59] <%jiggy_snipe> Sam Mahomes
[1:48:06] <rubbishbinge> those pansy ass politicians don't stand a chance
[1:48:07] <valentinevergil> The overheat bar fills up to cool down?
[1:48:42] <%FuqBoiSlim> think of it as an EX meter that refills automatically
[1:48:46] <Tucker0603> glowing eyes are enemies
[1:48:46] <%Irridium> You could also look for the lights on their heads.
[1:48:54] <%Irridium> The ones with the glowing faces = bad
[1:49:07] <%FuqBoiSlim> rip
[1:49:15] <+netrac> does this game have colorblind mode?
[1:49:20] <+Commissar_Rain> ohk :(
[1:49:27] <AngryContrarian> JET SET ANNOUNCEMENT IN AN HOUR
[1:49:28] <%Javaa01> That attack kills from behind low cover
[1:49:33] <vVAstrAVv> I though he dodgesd it for a second
[1:49:39] <valentinevergil> it pushed him aside, then aplied damage
[1:49:57] <%FuqBoiSlim> @angrycontrarian huh???? where

[1:52:30] <Xeroflame> I tried the first Jet Set but I couldnt get into it, I feel like I missed the train for it
[1:52:46] <%RioGascar> i feel we need text under the video to just say MINHS COLOR BLIND
[1:53:05] <+netrac> The first jet set isn't that great
[1:53:16] <+netrac> gameplay wise
[1:53:36] <%RioGascar> Sick
[1:53:38] <+WhereIsWill> JSRF on the switch when
[1:53:42] <quasiplaying> @WoolieVersus You still play mobile games woolie?
[1:53:45] <Xeroflame> is that so? thats unfortunate. the music is pretty godlike tho
[1:53:48] <Jathspuh> i couldn't play past the first 10 minutes of the first jet set
[1:53:50] <DaBigVitus> first jet set is weirdly slow and floaty
[1:53:52] <Jathspuh> too slow
[1:54:19] <Jathspuh> yeah floaty too. forgot about that atpCap
[1:54:28] <%FuqBoiSlim> I think it was an alright start. definitely not as good as the other extreme sports games out at the time
[1:54:37] <+ZuluKaneda> This game is sick
[1:55:03] <segbas2004> tbf the shooting alone was enough for me

[1:56:38] <APB_Harleqyn> wait... your melee attack changes depending on what weapon you have equipped!?!?!
[1:56:52] <Xeroflame> oh shit

[2:00:22] <%ozzrabbit> Kinda hate to be captain obvious here, but doesn't this game have a "Colorblind Mode"? I know this needs to go up on YouTube, but I think viewers would understand.

[2:00:26] <+valiard> is Minh colorblind?

[2:00:32] <fist_wizard_jay> Yes
[2:00:37] <Tucker0603> to certain colors
[2:00:38] <KnivesEve> hai
[2:00:40] <+valiard> oof
[2:00:46] <%Irridium> Woolie exploits it for wins
[2:00:56] <fist_wizard_jay> A weakness that has been exploited in many a game
[2:01:32] <+netrac> Did they fix the pc port?

[2:03:16] <nothuzad> ZuluKaneda first few weeks Vanquish ran at double game logic making deaths happen instantly and generally screwing with design
[2:03:17] <%Ashenik1> Good Russian massage
[2:03:20] <+netrac> @ZuluKaneda I remember part of the game logic being tied to FPS dying twice as fast
[2:03:40] <+ZuluKaneda> ohh
[2:03:41] <+netrac> @nothuzad was it fixed?
[2:03:59] <nothuzad> netrac ye I think a few weeks in I just palyed it recently and seemed fine
[2:04:09] <splatterroomtacos> Man, this game is great
[2:04:21] <zayasu> BibleThump
[2:04:30] <%Ipsenscastle> the desaturation in this game does it no favours at all, it's so exhausting to look at
[2:04:32] <+DesertPenguin> I missed the beginning, why isn't Woolie playing?
[2:04:32] <+netrac> I'm downloading it to check if it has colorblind mode
[2:04:36] <+RoughyID> I don't understand why that jim sterling guy gave this game a low score
[2:04:41] <corpseweed> i had one scripted event not happen on pc at 60 recently, but other than that i think it's fine
[2:05:16] <nothuzad> RoughyID gmae is pretty unconventional - doesnt really tease the features it has
[2:05:19] <%jiggy_snipe> pimp hand strong
[2:05:24] <%FuqBoiSlim> it's a 360 game from 2010 I dont think it has colorblind mode
[2:05:30] <%Javaa01> Score bonus basically
[2:05:33] <%HeavyMetalIceCream> @DesertPenguin Because last time Woolie tried to show people Vanquish, people left the room.
[2:05:50] <+DesertPenguin> Wha happun?
[2:06:16] <%FuqBoiSlim> woolieGASM_KI
[2:06:22] <+RoughyID> @nothuzad and just because of that he gave it a low score? seems pretty unreasonable, even though I kinda agree with his criticism on that front.
[2:06:23] <Jathspuh> works on guided missiles too @WoolieVersus
[2:06:34] <BallerSwagBro9k> Burns is literally just a Gears character LUL

[2:07:02] <%FuqBoiSlim> reminds me of the dad from astral chain
[2:07:19] <+RoughyID> Noo he didn't do the upgrade tech
[2:07:38] <%Solidnick18> oh i see
[2:07:50] <+netrac> according to a review there are not any colorblind modes
[2:07:53] <+netrac> so that sucks
[2:07:54] <+ZuluKaneda> @RoughyID This is kind of a old school game. You just play it to do good runs and high scores. But speedrun is popular nowadays so I don't know.
[2:08:11] <dmc5nero> this game is so fucking sick in a good way
[2:08:12] <%Javaa01> This is a decade old game, color blind modes were in short supply back then
[2:08:33] <%Javaa01> Color blind options started being more of a thing in like 2013-2014
[2:09:28] <corpseweed> it was re released recently though javaa
[2:09:29] <Tonicky > good old disk launcher
[2:09:33] <%Ipsenscastle> colour blind options took off when CoD:MW2 implemented them
[2:09:38] <stranger59> I think the first game I remember with a colorblind option was Perfect Dark Zero.
[2:09:42] <dmc5nero> if get the same weapon you already got it upgrades the gunn
[2:09:59] <segbas2004> they are quite red
[2:10:08] <+netrac> I mean that sucks as that is unfortunate kinda way
[2:10:12] <+RoughyID> @ZuluKaneda Still doesn't justify the low score, if that's what you're responding to. People were turned off by that score without even playing it.
[2:10:19] <%FuqBoiSlim> please tell the disc launcher goes through enemies
[2:10:31] <nothuzad> they are red but have unique distinguishable designs and he still will see them as other colors/values
[2:10:31] <%Ipsenscastle> The map is useless with R/G colourblindness
[2:10:44] <nothuzad> the map is pretty useless though - agreed
[2:11:07] <+hoenhime344> i REALLY hope mihn keeps with it. this game is awesome
[2:11:15] <stranger59> Vanquish got low scores cause people went in and played it like a normal shooter, standing and shooting, which is boring but can be done.
[2:11:22] <%Javaa01> The first really impressive suite of Colorblind options I saw was back in late 2013 with Battlefield 4, since that started covering the full suite of three common colorblindness variants
[2:11:39] <%Javaa01> And after that, it really started cementing itself across the industry
[2:12:10] <+ZuluKaneda> Disk launcher needed a buff imo CoolStoryBob
[2:12:20] <corpseweed> to be fair this game is also just very visually busy
[2:12:31] <dmc5nero> theres diffrent types of colorblindness?
[2:12:39] <corpseweed> i had a hard time seeing enemies sometimes, especially on a smaller screen
[2:13:28] <%Ipsenscastle> @dmc5nero several, depending on the rods/cones affected in your eyes
[2:13:51] <dmc5nero> wow thats crazy but im sure that sucks
[2:13:51] <+netrac> This game would benefit from a high contrast texture pack
[2:13:53] <valentinevergil> Kinda cool going rambo and have your friends calling tango positions
[2:13:59] <+hoenhime344> this is fun

[2:14:07] <%Ipsenscastle> most common is Red Green, makes them look muddy and indistinguishable

[2:15:53] <pshuuu> its jsut fire and forget but low damage
[2:16:13] <+ZuluKaneda> @hoenhime344 Disk launcher can cut the limbs of some enemies
[2:16:15] <+hoenhime344> even at highter levels?
[2:16:20] <+hoenhime344> ah ty
[2:16:36] <TheMirai> Game: you can only melee once Billy: I don't get it *jacks melee button*

[2:17:28] <+hoenhime344> god this game brings back so many good memories
[2:17:46] <+DullMouse_> Woolie lookin' like Steve from Blue's Clues.
[2:17:49] <Tucker0603> it eats suit energy
[2:17:51] <pshuuu> the melee reducing power to 0 is kinda annoying
[2:17:54] <+hoenhime344> its one of those games where you have to learn how to play. its not just a cover shooter

[2:18:57] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 18 minutes
[2:19:04] <%Ipsenscastle> The fact that melee overheats you always seemed like a bizarre choice to me
[2:19:14] <+netrac> netrac subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[2:19:40] <@Menitta> the Melees should've been a little weaker and not depleted the whole bar
[2:19:47] <+hoenhime344> i like it. melee in shooters is always a 1hit kill for some reason. this gives a viceral feedback and meaningful choice to use it
[2:19:48] <StrayCatRock> The overheat mechanic was the main thing i couldn't really get to grips with
[2:19:53] <Jathspuh> the whistles go WHOOO
[2:19:58] <StrayCatRock> like i couldn't split my attention between the game and the overheat gague
[2:20:00] <%Ipsenscastle> Literally anything cool you can do burns your bar, which leaves you spending half your time being lame. If kills/hits restored bar I'd like it much better
[2:20:11] <eldragon_1> I like this literal blind playthrough
[2:20:19] <+MrRabbles> that mini map sucks ass for how active what's going on in the center is
[2:20:20] <Tennochief> YO WAT'S VANQUISH LIKE?!
[2:20:24] <%netrac> Some sort of active recovery system would be cool
[2:20:34] <+NotHereToStream> vanquish is hype
[2:20:41] <DavidDredd84> VANQUISH atpGasm atpGasm atpGasm
[2:20:45] <Tennochief> NICE
[2:20:46] <@Menitta> Melees need to either be an ender or a desperation move

[2:21:03] <@Menitta> ending a wave that is
[2:21:03] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:21:07] <+hoenhime344> @netrac truth. som mechanic that is skill based to cool you down would be nice
[2:21:11] <zayasu> stoners atpQuan
[2:21:16] <%Javaa01> The Laser Cannon was originally a DLC gun, so that's why it shares the melee attack with the Shotgun
[2:21:25] <biomegabear> I usually keep a heavy and assult and a 3rd for whatever I find
[2:21:26] <vVAstrAVv> the dissapointment in woolies voice lol
[2:21:26] <dmc5nero> it doesnt need to be a desperation move
[2:21:32] <+hoenhime344> but there is already so much packed into this control system to begin with
[2:21:35] <%FuqBoiSlim> maybe like how nioh handles the stamina bar
[2:21:59] <@Menitta> I initially thought you'd get upgrades for your AR meter and how long cooldown would last
[2:22:02] <%netrac> I would make melee maybe recover you from overheat but be slower
[2:22:18] <biomegabear> its the first boss from ape escape
[2:22:24] <Jathspuh> monkaS
[2:22:25] <zayasu> atpRtsd

[2:25:53] <$razielhex> Protanopia is red.
[2:25:54] <+paladinstarbuster> happens to the best of us
[2:25:57] <+AntithesisEK> ahahah
[2:25:58] <$razielhex> Deuteranopia is greed
[2:26:00] <+steelmorrigan> overconfidence
[2:26:02] <biomegabear> I know red is one of them from the NUNS videos
[2:26:04] <%FuqBoiSlim> I think red-green
[2:26:05] <+DesertPenguin> There are two types of Deuteranopia. I have both
[2:26:06] <+NotHereToStream> red, there are red barrels and enemy
[2:26:07] <$razielhex> Tritanopia is blue (and not sex-linked)
[2:26:08] <+hoenhime344> i LOVE this. i really hope this becomes the playthrough to watch for the channel
[2:26:11] <BioApple> overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer
[2:26:20] <vVAstrAVv> red and green apparently
[2:26:20] <+DesertPenguin> Minh has Pro?
[2:26:21] <jorniev> EGO

[2:26:29] <+theAncopro> your being hummus
[2:26:31] <$razielhex> Yeah. I'm also a protoss

[2:27:19] <+hoenhime344> but off beat platinum games are some of THE BEST video game experiences of my life
[2:27:21] <+MrRabbles> there is a lot of information on the screen to process i do not blame minh at all
[2:27:44] <arikk42> pl
[2:27:48] <%Solidnick18> their is alot going on
[2:27:56] <+DesertPenguin> Yea lots of information. But all you need to know is bullets coming at you are from the direction of bad guys. Shoot back.
[2:28:00] <vVAstrAVv> backseat him into a master woolie lol

[3:01:51] <Andrei11Droasca> Im curious how dose color blindness even look like ,do you just se like a od greys
[3:02:11] <OkamiDude15> There’s different types of color blind types
[3:02:13] <stranger59> You can look up videos to see what colorblindness looks like, there are different kinds
[3:02:15] <%netrac> There are websites
[3:02:41] <jorniev> minh is just DOING
[3:02:49] <OkamiDude15> Minh:
[3:02:50] <%Ipsenscastle> aww
[3:03:04] <%netrac> Websites for colorblindness are great for UX
[3:03:08] <heartlesshealer> it's literally just both of the colors look like the same color. Like pink/gray color blindness will have the person think they are the same color. Knew someone who cried when he found out he got a present of his favorite color when it was actually gray
[3:03:11] <%Ipsenscastle> He's saying do an Urkel voice at him
[3:03:13] <OkamiDude15> Minh’s like don’t think, feel
[3:03:13] <emeraldskrull> Minh, drop your boost!
[3:03:13] <+paladinstarbuster> sbfpSandbag sbfpSandbag
[3:03:20] <segbas2004> the LP taxe perhaps?
[3:03:23] <KaseKaizer> this allegory is... stripThink

[3:03:40] <vVAstrAVv> it bugs me when ppl say mihns voice is annoying its his Fucking voice what do you want him to do about it lol
[3:04:05] <Andrei11Droasca> Don't worry Minh is you have the endurance to hit level 99 hitting slimes im sure you can beat this game LUL
[3:04:05] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[3:04:53] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Platinum is good for the gradual markup to insanity
[3:05:01] <heartlesshealer> Minh ground out Parasite Eve 3rd Birthday, he can do this
[3:05:03] <%Solidnick18> yeah
[3:05:11] <vVAstrAVv> how long does the cigarette draw fire
[3:05:16] <stranger59> This makes me want to boot up Vanquish again, it's been a while.
[3:05:18] <%Solidnick18> practice makes perfect as they say
[3:05:39] <jorniev> woolie is gonna help you get into platinum
[3:05:47] <segbas2004> segbas2004 converted from a Twitch Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub! 
[3:05:47] <stranger59> @vVAstrAVv Just a second or two, but that's what slowing down time is for.
[3:06:08] <emeraldskrull> minh drop a grenade, know what i mean?
[3:06:28] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Does anyone else remember Jack Packards opinion of this game, which was "it's slow and boring because all I want to do is sit behind cover like this is gears of war"
[3:06:31] <+DesertPenguin> Woolie, you should play Spider-Man (PS4). It's a lot of fun
[3:06:38] <redrins> cover is the new drop your shield
[3:06:54] <%Javaa01> You usually get one set of 3 grenades per one big fight
[3:07:01] <vVAstrAVv> i think he played spidey already
[3:07:16] <%RioGascar> i found out theres melee moves for different weapons
[3:07:42] <+DesertPenguin> I really just wanna see Woolie's version of Dark Souls 3
[3:07:47] <%RioGascar> also that dropkick grenade thing is not as useful as I thought
[3:08:06] <Andrei11Droasca> I'd like to see Woolie do Yakuza 0
[3:08:10] <+NotHereToStream> ^
[3:08:10] <%RioGascar> control also has a morphing weapon
[3:08:20] <buffmurffy> transforminf weapons are the shit
[3:08:25] <%jiggy_snipe> BIG FIST
[3:08:25] <T_Sasquatch> I literally just got vanquish on ps3 lmao
[3:08:26] <jorniev> omni weapon is an awesome idea for a game
[3:08:34] <+Negus_Rex> only hal is dumb
[3:08:36] <jorniev> but it cant be only gun
[3:08:36] <buffmurffy> gotta have that necrid tech
[3:08:45] <rubbishbinge> Malicious was pretty cool
[3:08:57] <jorniev> the hero is dead is also fun
[3:09:01] <TheDandyRex> Woolie see the Jet Set Radio Sona stuff yet?
[3:09:03] <Dapper_Cactuar> John Stewart best Green Lantern
[3:09:27] <+DesertPenguin> Kyle was pretty cool tho
[3:09:32] <Dapper_Cactuar> true
[3:09:34] <+DesertPenguin> In Grant Morrison's JLA it's Kyle so I like him
[3:09:43] <%SomersaultJustice> so you love Green Lantern then Kappa
[3:09:47] <segbas2004> infinite potential
[3:09:59] <%DensityD> WARPIG
[3:10:08] <%RioGascar> the issue is if the user is smart they can make most problems not exist
[3:10:11] <%DensityD> SO MUCH HUBRIS IN A WARPIG
[3:10:20] <jorniev> the reaver is also a cool sword that changes form
[3:10:49] <Andrei11Droasca> The hole Paranoid album is amazing
[3:11:14] <%Javaa01> Your life bar is your AR bar
[3:11:14] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:11:18] <heartlesshealer> War Pigs by Black Sabbath, if anyone's too young or forgetting classic metal
[3:11:23] <segbas2004> but it's not tho
[3:11:31] <%Javaa01> If you're out of AR, expect to die from any sustained amount of fire
[3:11:51] <%RioGascar> You also start sparking
[3:12:06] <segbas2004> it's the sound, slowdown
[3:12:06] <T_Sasquatch> I hate low health ui, it's always shit. I don't need my screen covered in red
[3:12:07] <segbas2004> etc.
[3:12:29] <heartlesshealer> Minh, as you grind you will get used to unconsciously identifying sparking and other stuff
[3:12:34] <%DensityD> a small dose of git gud git fast
[3:12:49] <arkv01> woolie whats going on with yo curtains?
[3:12:57] <arkv01> reggie is dying from that direct sunlight
[3:13:23] <%SomersaultJustice> radar love
[3:13:24] <@chesterr01> feels good @arkv01
[3:13:24] <heartlesshealer> ooooh... Yeah avoiding radar is a bad habit
[3:13:30] <%rytyoung> the radar doesn't show enemies only guns and crates
[3:13:33] <arkv01> LUL
[3:13:34] <segbas2004> I almost look more at the radar than what I'm shooting at in any shooter now XD
[3:13:38] <@chesterr01> ☀️☀️
[3:13:47] <%rytyoung> oh wait I'm an idiot it does lul
[3:13:55] <%RioGascar> i almost never use radarin games
[3:13:56] <Andrei11Droasca> Oh ,there's sunlight there ,i was confused for a second LUL
[3:14:09] <%RioGascar> its too much time to look at it and look back
[3:14:19] <segbas2004> sbfpSetIn
[3:14:19] <%RioGascar> better to just adjust
[3:14:19] <heartlesshealer> treat radar as a second tinier screen for more info
[3:14:28] <+Hinasil> The light of the sun casts its rays upon Mihn and Reggie, and the trash lord remains in darkness
[3:14:42] <vVAstrAVv> teach us punch dad
[3:14:42] <arkv01> D:
[3:14:49] <%jiggy_snipe> Little V and Woolie are both fine because they are provided a lot of knowledge
[3:15:02] <%jiggy_snipe> providing*
[3:15:04] <arkv01> woolie wallows in the satanic influence
[3:15:14] <segbas2004> when minh will see the matrix this game is going to be a piece of cake
[3:15:40] <heartlesshealer> Ah, so they're throwing ideas for people to grab onto

[3:19:12] <arkv01> ahh radiata stories, the jrpg I've been pining to play for a decade

[3:19:51] <arkv01> Q U A L I T Y
[3:19:57] <heartlesshealer> The NPCs have a daily schedule, but it's really strict so they still feel like robots??? Gave me weird vibes for a console game
[3:20:06] <%RioGascar> Me too lots of fun stuff

[3:20:44] <%Lion_kun> just do a long one now and again
[3:20:48] <Andrei11Droasca> So no SMT games KUL
[3:20:50] <segbas2004> like once a year or something
[3:20:51] <%jiggy_snipe> you need to space out those games
[3:20:51] <%gatorafan> rip the KH LP some people were waiting for.
[3:20:51] <+tearknack> i watch streams only now
[3:21:04] <arkv01> fyi you can do mgs with reggie under 5 hours per numbered game TehePelo
[3:21:07] <%Lion_kun> I'd say once every 6 months
[3:21:08] <%SomersaultJustice> but I love the TMS LP :(
[3:21:14] <%gatorafan> TMS was a great LP, people are cowards.
[3:21:18] <%SomersaultJustice> #13000FE
[3:21:26] <nothuzad> indeed SomersaultJustice :)
[3:21:28] <vVAstrAVv> yeah i watch vods of the long ones if i miss it live
[3:21:33] <arkv01> uncultured swine couldn't enjoy TMS
[3:21:38] <+eggstyr0ne> just edit the long games to short reaction vids
[3:21:39] <%RioGascar> i think the beef games should be like. Wait a couple of full mini lps till a big beefy lp
[3:21:44] <Ranko2Danko> i lovw being a month behind
[3:21:52] <%gatorafan> I'll never forget Matt's inmediate regret for modelling himself after Barry daedra1LaughingTibs

[3:22:44] <heartlesshealer> takes from youtube, but adds for viewers in general
[3:22:45] <zayasu> me :) but I usually leave a like for the videos
[3:22:48] <+tearknack> yeah i way prefer streams over lps
[3:22:49] <%RioGascar> it is odd how far away youtube is now
[3:22:58] <%Irridium> could just do the long ones as straight up streams
[3:23:14] <vVAstrAVv> hey now. twitch vods might get subscribers at least
[3:23:24] <%gatorafan> I still chick Woolie's YT every now and then, mosly when I want to check other people's reaction to some of the gold we find on this streams.

[0:03:02] <Youwereeatenbyalid> is overcooked multiplayer or single player?
[0:03:05] <InXplotch> Overcooked is always a great game to pull out and make everyone angry with
[0:03:08] <InXplotch> it's multiplayer

[0:03:26] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @gigacanuck because it is?
[0:03:32] <InXplotch> generally it's best played in co-op but you technically can play it single player

[0:04:22] <gigacanuck> Frieza saga, obviously
[0:04:30] <+Deepfriedhamster> gt>Z

[3:32:45] <Major_monotone> Combine the two with the steaks as the bread in this crab sandwich
[3:32:45] <Maldoree> crabs are bottom feeders....they eat each other
[3:32:49] <veldinmusic> Crab is my jam but steak beats it any day
[3:32:49] <+AntithesisEK> but crab goes on the steak as you pour the butter on.
[3:32:51] <the_sprankton> I live in Nebraska, so most of the crab we get here is all shell
[3:32:53] <Raenef> It’s too much work for too little meat
[3:32:53] <+rdark_ksu> How bout oysters/mussels ?
[3:32:54] <%Tiste_Andii> lol, somebody get woolie a wall-e floating bed
[3:32:57] <worldbrand> i'm not a fan of eating arthropods
[3:32:57] <SirGO0SE> garlic butter has its own stands
[3:32:57] <DRAGKUDO> That is the price to eating an immortal
[3:33:01] <BobaFetish2124> ur crab game is trash
[3:33:03] <the_sprankton> @rdark_ksu mussels are great
[3:33:04] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @turf_wind_and_fire
[3:33:07] <%UrsulaCat> Punchmom is right and good
[3:33:11] <khetrak> @WoolieVersus any plain to play anything else or just chill
[3:33:14] <Raenef> Prawns though
[3:33:15] <SirGO0SE> #eastcoastbeastcoast
[3:33:26] <FenixSeraph> Salmon is amazing
[3:33:27] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:33:32] <%GohanEgret> salmon is S tier
[3:33:34] <notquitedead123> "I have to work to get to the food" thats a first world problem if I ever saw one.
[3:33:36] <%Totally_not_toby> walleye rocks the shit out of every other fish
[3:33:38] <%Tiste_Andii> so, i talk shit, but ive never ate crab, or lobster
[3:33:43] <+rdark_ksu> Most white fish is on the blander side
[3:33:49] <+pickledundead> when it comes to sushi, I love me some eel
[3:33:51] <Major_monotone> I cannot disagree with this conversation more, seafood in all forms is top tier
[3:33:59] <SirGO0SE> grilled octopus is the fucking BOMB
[3:33:59] <+Jhylla81> seafood usually needs some kind of sauce or butter to taste great. But a great steak doesn't need anything
[3:34:00] <%Totally_not_toby> other than catfish. walleye and catfish own the fuck out of everything else
[3:34:10] <worldbrand> seafood is anathema to me
[3:34:12] <%gigacanuck> beatsaber?
[3:34:16] <Maldoree> Enjoy all that plastic in your seafood cause we're stuck with for the next 200+yrs unless we do something bout it
[3:34:20] <@Solidus_113> Woolie VS LittlevMills in Beat Boxers, the rhythm fighting game
[3:34:22] <+AntithesisEK> octopus is chewy but if it's rubbery you had it poorly tenderized
[3:34:23] <Major_monotone> Ever have Monkfish? Texture of lobster tail, flavor of a whitefish

[0:30:53] <%thisisacoolguy> It's the super star method where you grab powers as they come up
[0:30:55] <+projectrad> The only thing hearts are hiding IIRC is an unlockable character. You can get normal clear regardless and see what the game has to offer while missing out on collecting hearts
[0:30:56] <%SeriousMrBlack> Woolie how does your living space work?
[0:31:00] <Banjoboozle> @WoolieVersus Would you say this or Monster Hunter World is your Game of the Year?

[0:32:46] <yakuzafromtexas> WOOLIE IS OUTDRAWING BOB ROSS
[0:32:49] <+Raspada_Ryner> @WoolieVersus can I play this game without knowledge of the Kirby lore? Will I be missing out on a lot of hype references?
[0:32:50] <Banjoboozle> Getting ready for another reset
[0:32:50] <SaltyDongs> Friends die on the battle field mourning for them is pointless
[0:32:52] <alexandrecau> do it
[0:32:53] <RantingRavager> Is @WoolieVersus going to do streaming more seriously and start doing the twitch grind, or is this still just a hobby?
[0:32:55] <%Lando_CS> I started playing Triple Deluxe and now I cant stop this is all your fault woolie
[0:32:55] <buffmurffy> woolie would you be interested in a full 3D kirby game?
[0:32:56] <Jillimanjaro> it's very fun multiplayer. at least try 2 player for the 2 player doors
[0:33:01] <Banjoboozle> Friends die if they are killed
[0:33:04] <ProcHoliday> If only woolie had some best friends to play the game with *sobbing loudly*
[0:33:05] <+tigerfang86> Tablelords but it's star allies

[1:13:06] <SoaringLettuce> paige os better than every last one of you
[1:13:06] <%Xanderbats> So actually I just probably missed the explanation - Woollie VS will primarily be solo lps and Castle Superbeast will just be a podcast?
[1:13:06] <jaycds> Pat>Woolie>power gap>LTG>DSP>Matt
[1:13:07] <Billyuppercut0> I understand that would get to you
[1:13:07] <grayjammer> Oof yuck ranking Real People :(

[1:13:33] <aeonicvector> Dont be afraid to get other people in, just do you, and remember, Chat is a people you can play off aswell
[1:13:34] <axelcezar> but why can't you call on pat or mat to play with you?
[1:13:35] <mercado94> Whens Boruto Dad 3?
[1:13:36] <RadRegice> you and pat have gotta do a DMC5 lp somewhere though

[1:13:43] <%thisisacoolguy> Wait you called in Reggie? Did he announce Mother 3 finally?
[1:13:45] <+th3madness> he moves his mouth away from the mic so he can cough

[1:13:54] <%SuttonOMEGA> oh fuck, sweetcheeks
[1:13:54] <+Walopoh> Solo LPs = sbfpUno Lps
[1:13:55] <SweetCheeksTrap> sweetc2SmugCheeks
[1:13:55] <dakuman13> I'd have CastleSuperBeast be there for occasional LPs that you actually wanna do, not a fulltime thing
[1:13:56] <nothuzad> @WoolieVersus btw did you give hades a spin already? (with you liking rougelites and supergiant games9
[1:14:00] <nothuzad> *)
[1:14:03] <0rond> @WoolieVersus do you remember accidentally calling billy minh back during the metroid fusion LP?
[1:14:04] <deity_majora> @WoolieVersus Don't be afraid of using chat as a crutch during streams
[1:14:06] <ImportunoDiz> Hmmmm
[1:14:08] <JWalnut> because he's a tryhard
[1:14:10] <Buttromancer> metaknight is vergil
[1:14:11] <masterfire23> @rawklobstah88 kira is clearly the best jojo
[1:14:12] <CrmznOgre> Have you figured it out yet Woolie?
[1:14:14] <Kalcom> lytCANDY
[1:14:15] <ImportunoDiz> Meta-Knight IS TOO PROUD
[1:14:16] <az_tech9> just now noticed the kirby headphones
[1:14:17] <%thisisacoolguy> Kirby isn't a baby, that's a anime only thing
[1:14:17] <alexandrecau> because his mask stop his inhaling ability duh
[1:14:18] <+Theophilus567> So does that mean you and pat don’t have plans to continue things, doing LPs together?
[1:14:18] <SoaringLettuce> @punishedraccoon WOOLIE. OVER. GOD. OVER HEAVEN
[1:14:20] <ImportunoDiz> Also that
[1:14:20] <+cvp5127> nature vs nurture
[1:14:21] <soulless1996> I have to bounce, but sincerely Thank You Woolie
[1:14:22] <Reaver_Parable> did you ever play Danganronpa v3 you and liam got me into the series
[1:14:23] <%MONSTRx_x> metaknight is a coward
[1:14:23] <Loarfy> copy power op
[1:14:24] <$nitronLVIII> Kirby is like some kind of mutant right?
[1:14:24] <+RichardRasmus> because kirby is the better race
[1:14:24] <$Xertagon1> cheer100 Just saw your video on the DMC5 demo, got me hyped even though I only played 4. PS. you got this, man
[1:14:25] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> there's a Palutena's Guidance about that in SMash
[1:14:26] <%Rawklobstah88> @masterfire23 fucc u rite
[1:14:27] <SomeDwarf> Because eating people isn't honorable
[1:14:29] <darkdagon769> it'd be kinda awkward for the podcast to do "what would you're doing for lp" and woolie telling pat he's doing something with matt or liam
[1:14:30] <nolifegamin> Meta Knight refuses to succ
[1:14:31] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Kirby > Meta Knight
[1:14:32] <$SodiusChubz> yeah Kirby isnt a baby
[1:14:32] <JWalnut> hmmm
[1:14:34] <aeonicvector> Metanight CAN copy, but he full Vergil it new headcanon
[1:14:34] <sparrrow_> He's Kirby's future son Kappa
[1:14:34] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> they don't even know if MK has absorb
[1:14:35] <rick_deckard_84> Stikki Fingaz!!
[1:14:35] <Buttromancer> metaknight can copy but refuses to b/c he believes in bushido
[1:14:35] <Billyuppercut0> Kirby is a special boy
[1:14:35] <+TotalLies> Based Woolie
[1:14:37] <Sloavon> kirby is a God
[1:14:38] <$SodiusChubz> thats a animu thing
[1:14:39] <flyingyoshy> first time here what's up
[1:14:42] <sirbapo> Kirby is an eldritch abomination confirmed
[1:14:43] <Djinnazz> A baby Old God?
[1:14:45] <AlchemiBeast> kirby is the knight from hollow knight

[1:14:45] <+budafuka> Kirby is literally the Thing
[1:14:46] <%thisisacoolguy> @woolieversus Kirby isn't a baby my guy. That's a anime only thing.
[1:14:46] <ImportunoDiz> Oh I get it
[1:14:46] <spawnzie> Maybe Meta Knight got stuck in the sword copy
[1:14:46] <SkewerSTARSTREAM> Meta Knight faces death head on!
[1:14:46] <%furiousfurioso> Kirby also doesn't have wings
[1:14:47] <+Joe2187> Kirby is a being from the 8th dimensionm
[1:14:47] <%acatnamedoj> Meta knight daddy
[1:14:48] <Overloard> woolie confirmed for superman
[1:14:48] <ca5per4> yoooooo that DIO statue tho
[1:14:49] <+QuadraticGravity> Meta Knight's morphic abilities are adapted to speed, agility, and his wings
[1:14:50] <Banjoboozle> Imagine thinking Clark Kent is Superman Kappa
[1:14:53] <radicalapollo> HE'S WHAT?
[1:14:53] <Sleepology> How do you not have a Kirby shirt?
[1:14:56] <+namillus> The whole "roundish with stubby armhands and feeties" seems to be a template for Popstar.
[1:14:56] <$iiStarMist> charity100 2018 has been the worst year ever and I hoped the Best Friend split up would be the last bad thing to happen but less than 2 hours ago we got news my uncle passed away. Please 2018 just end already! #charity
[1:14:56] <0rond> @WoolieVersus what if the ability to succ is looked down upon by metaknight? and that's why he wears the mask
[1:14:56] <Ropcord> i'm just sayin that evil alternate universe version of wispy woods had the same color scheme 🤔
[1:14:57] <+sundizzle> Pog
[1:14:59] <hybridofthepond> Kirby is eldritch Jesus among his kin
[1:15:00] <mercado94> oh boy
[1:15:00] <grimenigma> @woolieversus thank you for the podcasts, they are a relaxing to listen to. You are a very wise man woolie
[1:15:00] <OldManDeckardCain> meta knight is the kirby from the dark future
[1:15:00] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> MK also prefers to hone his swordsmanship and fights more fair than Kirby
[1:15:01] <+Ellie_Eyegore> Kirby is the eldritch entity from beyond except he actually cares
[1:15:01] <danpc5> woolie!

[1:15:58] <+Walopoh> Kirby is like the SCP Scale of being Omega Keter

[1:17:12] <%Xanderbats> I definitely do not envy you. The subreddit was basically running a deadpool to see which one of you would stream first and get bombarded with the serious questions :/

[1:17:38] <+namillus> @jimmiepyle Put that way the MetaKnight = Vergil comparisons only grow. MetaKnight and Vergil tread a path with a specific goal, whereas Kirby and Dante are flexible and easy-going. (and also BIG FOODIES)

[1:18:27] <TheChampionofBoxes> You could just set days for certain games
[1:18:29] <%SuttonOMEGA> zezedoxeren DSP played Witcher 3?
[1:18:30] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> he doesnt stream that much
[1:18:30] <%MrN64> <3
[1:18:31] <+combomaniadeluxe> I don't think people would mind that through
[1:18:31] <gunstar73> Gwent stream sfhOWO
[1:18:32] <$nitronLVIII> 10 hour stream lets go
[1:18:35] <captainthunderwolf> @lemon_lore He did actually, and he likes it now.
[1:18:35] <Agami23> pats a psycho. dont use him as an example of how to do things
[1:18:38] <Luvinsus> Oh yeah, he was cranking out 7+ hours streams almost every day for Hollow Knight
[1:18:38] <+Chimeraelite> true, true
[1:18:38] <ElenaManetta> @WoolieVersus For your channel LPs, are you going to avoid becoming a "that genre guy" who plays similar types of games, or embrace it to gain a more consistent crowd?
[1:18:40] <%ItsCaptainDisco> You could do Thronebreaker too!
[1:18:41] <pistachio_the_nut> TRUE
[1:18:41] <%theKittenhugs> @WoolieVersus Alright so when's Tablelords: Dungeons & Dragons cheer100
[1:18:42] <hoghoncho> god a batman stream..... so goood
[1:18:43] <Caidezes> Hollow Knight's like 40 hours. Pat's crazy.
[1:18:44] <+ZeOrbling> i wouldnt say youre locked in if your community is informed from the get-go
[1:18:44] <SoaringLettuce> you can switch games, people dont expect you to stick to one thing
[1:18:44] <ZeterZero > Love you woolz. Never give up. Like an Acorn.
[1:18:46] <dakuman13> 48 HOUR WITCHER STREAM SOON
[1:18:46] <Angry_Ev1L> @WoolieVersus I dunno dude. People are streaming like 12 hours of RDR2 for like a month and still end up successful. Tho I guess just do what you think is fun etc
[1:18:49] <danknugglit> Witcher 3 confirmed for smash
[1:18:49] <%Colinatlarge> Is there ever a timeline where a fighting game can win GOTY? Or is there not enough midfle age dads trying to be fathers for the msinstream to pay attention to?
[1:18:49] <generalve> Play Sly Cooper !
[1:18:51] <ca5per4> 24 hour Withcer 3 stream confirmed? 🤔
[1:18:52] <hyphixsys> @DesuDesuDokiDoki he's doing something else, behind the scene, that much is obvious
[1:18:52] <+StardustCrusader> Woolie versus The List
[1:18:53] <punkdrunkmonk> @WoolieVersus just don't burn youself out there big guy
[1:18:55] <%jimmiepyle> you dont have to lock into one game. i know many popular streamers that only do a couple hours of a long game a week and maybe rotate between ones they find interesting
[1:18:55] <az_tech9> woolie watches classic boxing fights, do it
[1:18:55] <FrozenShamrock> Deltarunes
[1:18:56] <%doctorturing> So Castle Superbeast is a podcast only, or an LP channel too? Sorry for asking so much, but I really do want to know this going forward
[1:18:57] <PJAStuDIOS> Should we resend our podcast questions?

[1:19:13] <IronEncore> Yeah don't burn out man

[1:19:29] <Lukas_Ipsum> @woolieversus I'd be down for watching peek ins of longer games where you just show us whatever part of the long game you're working on instead of having to stream the whole thing
[1:19:31] <SkewerSTARSTREAM> No don't actually do that...
[1:19:31] <+FackinCrazy> @WoolieVersus Did you ever go play dark souls 3 yourself ? if not that would be a great stream.

[2:11:18] <+Cigwynn> StreamTax octoSad
[2:11:22] <ooblagis> Just do it perfect the first try, I don't see what's so hard about it
[2:11:24] <lewdskeletor13> Is Kirby the Darl Souls if video games?
[2:11:25] <Tuskor13> @WoolieVersus What would you say is your favorite Kirby powerup
[2:11:28] <%king_wragles> the stream tax is perverse and obscure
[2:11:28] <Billyuppercut0> The real challenge is Soul Melter EX
[2:11:29] <%KawaiiJetty> It's fine, let the poyo embrace you @WoolieVersus
[2:11:32] <%Xanderbats> Seriously though, Woolie. You're the boss man. No need to apologize to chat.
[2:11:35] <CALLthaDoctah> does the whole game have this aesthetic?
[2:11:42] <dakuman13> Yeah you totally need someone here to read chat
[2:11:47] <%KnightsoftheOnion> Hey Woolie been loving the Kirby lore. Got me to play through Dream Land 2 and omg some of those Rainbow Pieces were a pain to get.

[2:11:50] <+ElfLord89> Hey Woolie
[2:11:52] <Tophattington> @tuskor13 Ganon Kirby
[2:11:54] <ooblagis> Only this game mode has the weird cosmos tile set
[2:11:55] <+TsunamiPoro> suplex is so fuckin hype
[2:11:57] <SomersaultJustice> Ah I see you are a man of taste as well
[2:11:58] <+nova12833> PAt cube
[2:12:00] <%yeknomlive> i like smash
[2:12:00] <%DashXero> You got this.
[2:12:02] <kiraellion> why does no one use wheel?
[2:12:04] <SixthSun2> You said Throw, not Suplex @WoolieVersus
[2:12:06] <+ElfLord89> Hey chat
[2:12:06] <+Solidnick18> suplex Kreygasm
[2:12:07] <Billyuppercut0> Best ability
[2:12:08] <Shisno27> You are EDUCATED STUPID
[2:12:09] <+TsunamiPoro> also bugzy himself is hype
[2:12:11] <stuffamiriteyea> ganon kirby is pretty strong
[2:12:11] <Ropcord> makes sense LUL
[2:12:12] <%thisisacoolguy> ROCKY 3 NO
[2:12:12] <$nitronLVIII> SPEEDRUN BOYS
[2:12:12] <1101lovelace> The command grab demands more honesty.
[2:12:21] <edward11231> @yeknomlive But smash Kirby is F tier Kappa
[2:12:25] <dakuman13> SUPLEX is solid
[2:12:29] <FenixSeraph> how are the CPUs in this game anyway
[2:12:32] <+DeadpanSoupcan> you can go back for the hearts after getting the end
[2:12:34] <Cure_Optimism> Favourite Kirby's Air Ride vehicle
[2:12:35] <+Nephthyz> paint waifu
[2:12:35] <+Masutasodo> Oh yea from squeak squad
[2:12:35] <Fenrirlives> Animal Kirby is also rad
[2:12:35] <%Nitsuj293> Smash was a good powerup
[2:12:35] <JWalnut> light
[2:12:37] <prime_name> Animal is one of my favorites
[2:12:37] <+TsunamiPoro> oh yea high jump was sick
[2:12:39] <%thisisacoolguy> Hi Jump and Magic
[2:12:42] <+Noponiz> high jump is super stronk
[2:12:43] <ooblagis> Is my boy wing back?
[2:12:43] <+AXL808> ghost kirby
[2:12:44] <LotS__> Ball too
[2:12:45] <thewoolieholeofdavidcage> thor
[2:12:45] <%thisisacoolguy> Old dead moves I like
[2:12:45] <JWalnut> mini
[2:12:46] <grayjammer> Tornado wrecked shop in Squeak Squad
[2:12:47] <%Ivyna_J_Spyder> Ghost Kirby was super fun
[2:12:48] <%Qsmash_> UFO is rare nowadays
[2:12:49] <The_Swedish_X> high jump was Kirby adventure wasn't it?
[2:12:50] <+bobfriskit> it was like a pillow with a cape
[2:12:50] <faldin> I mean kirby can float, so why does he need a high jump
[2:12:50] <lewdskeletor13> Guys Kirby survived because he’s the best, not because of any bias KappaClaus
[2:12:51] <Smyter> ness kirby is cool
[2:12:52] <Sp3ctre48> Yoyo has always been my favorite
[2:12:52] <+Matto424> High jump was like used a bit in uh the kirby golf game
[2:12:54] <SixthSun2> Starman was his name, iirc
[2:12:55] <%obsooxen> UFO man was the cutest
[2:12:56] <landsharkRAWR> bring back clean tbh
[2:12:57] <+Belakitu> Smash and Bubble Kirby, Animal/Claw Kirby too
[2:13:00] <+mgs3ladderscene> so isnt it weird kirby just takes on the forms of his friends
[2:13:00] <+TsunamiPoro> return to dream land had high jump but i dont think it had ufo
[2:13:01] <$sirbapo> wheelie
[2:13:02] <duel_pro> The Smash power was awesome
[2:13:04] <%DaniSaintDani> I hope yarn kirby becomes a power up at some point
[2:13:08] <deviljhojho94> Kirby iS the best tho
[2:13:08] <+Arkfyre> bomb + cutter from kirby 64 was a fun one
[2:13:12] <sage_of_wind> they put high jumps moveset into spider so its ok
[2:13:15] <Tuskor13> Mine is Wing
[2:13:15] <bazz_tv> i miss Wheelie Rider, that was only in Kirby super star

[2:35:38] <+xGreenflame> Can't get it if you hit the wrong one first
[2:35:39] <%thisisacoolguy> It did drop, you hit the bottom peg

[2:35:40] <+Cigwynn> Gordo! sbfpSOB
[2:35:40] <+imextremelymanly> all that just to suffer
[2:35:41] <JWalnut> it gets crushed
[2:35:41] <spawnzie> You didn't do it perfect on the first try
[2:35:42] <gunstar73> The game finessed you
[2:35:45] <shinji_ifrit> The Spikey
[2:35:45] <%Ariksgabs> MORTIS
[2:35:45] <alexandrecau> had to spark it
[2:35:48] <Kalcom> because you failed
[2:35:48] <dakuman13> hah daroach joke

[2:35:49] <+KingZaffy> Cosmic Karma because Daroach, I guess
[2:35:50] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> you hit the bottom one
[2:35:51] <+korth367> reset then look ahead
[2:35:52] <G_Lancaster> F
[2:35:53] <lemonhead996> you werent supposed to hit the bottom one
[2:35:54] <+PlayKingdomHeartsGames> you do the top oen first
[2:35:54] <$nitronLVIII> DONT LEARN DO IT PERFECT THE FIRST TIME
[2:35:54] <%Profbathrobe> Have good Christmas Woolie krunkSup
[2:35:55] <Belades1> @WoolieVersus The heart dropped into the blocks sent out by the bottom peg and is now inaccessible
[2:35:55] <+AlMiRajGaming> the spike one is a trap
[2:35:55] <%aishman> @WoolieVersus You fucked up by not listening to @PeachSaliva
[2:35:56] <+nova12833> !HEART BROKE!
[2:35:56] <mariquitarei> MORTIS
[2:35:56] <DracaenaLeaf> The bottom one ruined it
[2:35:56] <snake_zen> you can only hit one
[2:35:56] <+Solidnick18> the heart went in the lava thing maybe
[2:35:57] <+AXL808> They PLAN on you messing up to get rid of the heart
[2:35:57] <%thisisacoolguy> The bottom peg hides the heart
[2:35:57] <+dtogo> U think its that easy? Kappa
[2:35:57] <FoxInABeret> Can't hit the one with the Gordo.
[2:36:00] <+griffball13> @WoolieVersus because the spike was first it destroyed the heart
[2:36:00] <+RichardRasmus> how far into the game is this
[2:36:00] <+TintainiumCan> You can only hit the Heart one, or they overlap and you can't reach the heart
[2:36:00] <ooblagis> The UFO mouse

[2:37:15] <Belades1> @WoolieVersus It starts the blocks moving.
[2:37:15] <%Nitsuj293> That tuned it on
[2:37:15] <ooblagis> Otherwise it sticks "down"
[2:37:15] <SideChar> so you already did it
[2:37:17] <CynicalGrey> It activated the lava block
[2:37:17] <%Ivyna_J_Spyder> Freeze the blocks!
[2:37:18] <%aishman> What if you freeze the blocks?
[2:37:18] <The_Swedish_X> the spark started the moving blocks.
[2:37:19] <JWalnut> it makes it move

[3:05:51] <$sirbapo> nice fight stick
[3:05:54] <hoghoncho> you should do table lords some time though for sure. its been a while
[3:05:59] <Bouldus> would table lords be table top lords?
[3:06:00] <cureneckbeard> i get it
[3:06:00] <+zanzibar_junker> Episodic would be better paced
[3:06:02] <+witupo> Tablelords was hype as hell
[3:06:03] <%DashXero> I'd like to see more TableLords.
[3:06:05] <Legendary2Bass> DnD DnD
[3:06:10] <%king_wragles> Plague as a DM would be the shit
[3:06:10] <%rcoin> woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM

[3:06:17] <lewdskeletor13> Paige was here PogChamp
[3:06:18] <lithmoan > that would be dope!
[3:06:21] <+Aetropos> i love the long chunks
[3:06:22] <%bigbradish> I really dug it
[3:06:25] <buffmurffy> if its DnD a podcast format works well
[3:06:26] <SkewerSTARSTREAM> His headphones eat the sounds!
[3:06:35] <%Shonen404> woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM
[3:06:40] <CruxAustralis> Split in parts, maybe?
[3:06:40] <%sunriser696> just live streamed it
[3:06:44] <+PalmtopNami> @woolieversus but people dint have a problem with watching it streamed. look at critrole and court of swords.
[3:06:44] <%TheSniperJoe> critical role disagrees
[3:06:44] <KruelDestiny> bit size
[3:06:44] <DatAsuna> *nervously glances at 7 hour video*
[3:06:45] <Bouldus> i would love the see a dnd game from you guys
[3:06:45] <Legendary2Bass> Plague DM!!!!
[3:06:46] <+Generalfroggy> Geek and sundry work with much less for longer
[3:06:47] <+Katalist_> nooo I need it raw
[3:06:48] <+TaifuDragon> @WoolieVersus I know a few people who do DnD streams. There's a market for long-form tabletop on twitch/in stream form
[3:06:50] <+TheImmortal70> @woolieversus As someone who watches dnd podcasts, and vods on twitch, long periods of just straight content are perfectly consumable for me
[3:06:51] <cureneckbeard> Lets Play: D&D 5th Edition
[3:06:52] <1101lovelace> The audio comes out through Kirby's farts.
[3:06:52] <Bouldus> plague DM would be great
[3:06:54] <ooblagis> Protip: you can make a podcast out of it. Lots of people found success with that.
[3:06:57] <CruxAustralis> like 3 parts
[3:06:57] <Fenrirlives> @WoolieVersus do it like the Unexpectables. Livesteaming the games bring in more viewers!
[3:06:57] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> Split into segments for normie scum?
[3:06:58] <+robertwlewis> Fat Kreygasm
[3:06:58] <+ozmodek> @WoolieVersus Look into how Glass Cannon Podcast edits their table.
[3:07:00] <+l3sovikk> Hype, I caught a woolie stream.
[3:07:00] <%Xanderbats> Nah, just give us that raw shit
[3:07:01] <Mr_Jumbles> tbh KDM isn't a game to watch
[3:07:02] <PhantomMaskJr> bronzeQU

[3:07:05] <jotabranded> Love you Woolie <3
[3:07:06] <+Aetropos> As long as Raw versions are available, cuz I like the uneditted
[3:07:06] <lewdskeletor13> That’d be rad as heck
[3:07:10] <SkewerSTARSTREAM> OMG, THE KIRBY HEADPHONES ATE 2MELLO'S SOUNDS!
[3:07:10] <+griffball13> Plauge DM = Furries everywhere
[3:07:10] <CruxAustralis> I'm always for raw instead of edited/cut down stuff
[3:07:11] <hoghoncho> you def dont have time to dm lol
[3:07:12] <+imextremelymanly> people usually like it raw when it comes to D&D
[3:07:17] <MForan98> @WoolieVersus Yeah, it's a commitment to stick around for a TTG for that long, I do, but I'm a huge nerd
[3:07:19] <AggsMK7> BLAT BLAT
[3:07:21] <kiraellion> GUN
[3:07:21] <Bouldus> @griffball13 so normal DnD Kappa

[3:07:29] <gustavozxd> depends on the move
[3:07:29] <Legendary2Bass> Stream vs LP???

[3:07:35] <+treborant> Mask with gun
[3:07:36] <+zanzibar_junker> ARSENE IS A GUN
[3:07:37] <poweredscoot> Kirby gets a fukken gun

[3:07:45] <+Belakitu> D&D Part 5: Golden Wind
[3:07:46] <+robertwlewis> vineSchut vineKirb
[3:07:46] <FoxInABeret> ! GUN ABSORBED !
[3:07:47] <+chiluzza> Kirby with a gun is literally unstoppable
[3:07:48] <%sunriser696> evil kirby
[3:07:48] <+imextremelymanly> They didn't give snake a gun, I don't think they will give Joker a gun
[3:07:49] <umbypokochan> too pure
[3:07:51] <KruelDestiny> He ate his true self D:
[3:07:51] <+Totally_not_toby> kirby is at peace with himself, he is his own persona
[3:07:52] <@mothmandraws> woolie is the inner daemon
[3:07:52] <+TheImmortal70> Does Kirby HAVE a self?
[3:07:52] <42nfl19> SO ITS JUST SHADOW?
[3:07:53] <+bobfriskit> If B is the persona button, then maybe gets his OWN PERSONA!
[3:07:54] <Tyrant_Bahamut> Shadow Kirby!
[3:07:55] <agadejobi> Oh lord
[3:07:55] <+DuurHuur> @WoolieVersus Have you seen that dmc3 multiplayer mod? 4 dante's going CUH-RAZY at once is a wild sight.
[3:07:56] <Roro_Frostcaller> Kirby is unfiltered
[3:07:56] <@mothmandraws> he is the *
[3:07:56] <+silencieux7> Food Guilt
[3:07:57] <$skullomaniaskullo> GUN
[3:07:59] <+SeaBassTheLad> moon21 moon22
[3:07:59] <Fenrirlives> KIRBY IS PURE ID
[3:07:59] <ooblagis> You say that, but we're about hit HARD LORE
[3:07:59] <+ozmodek> His final smash is going to be Sataneal
[3:08:00] <mercado94> Kirby now gets access to the Velvet Room
[3:08:00] <Wildbold> He is already his best self
[3:08:00] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> Smash would be arsene
[3:08:01] <mr_ESB> kirby just wants to eat
[3:08:01] <kiraellion> hes the void soul HE IS THE SHADOW
[3:08:01] <%Xanderbats> So Kirby is the protagonist from P4
[3:08:01] <Darthkitten_Prime> Kirby gets the Persona "Dark Matter".
[3:08:02] <mrjohncarlton> Is Meta Knight Kirby's shadow? He has the yellow eyes?
[3:08:02] <jinking79> Kirby with a stand
[3:08:02] <prime_name> THERE IS A SHADOW KIRBY
[3:08:02] <agadejobi> This guy's wearing Kirby Headphones!
[3:08:03] <+SeaBassTheLad> moon23 moon24
[3:08:03] <PokeyMcFork> i mean he made friends with shadow kirby from the amazing mirror world so
[3:08:03] <Megapikman132> Kirby is the true self.
[3:08:03] <edward11231> Maybe that dark magic attack Arsene does, I forgot the name of the spell
[3:08:03] <SomersaultJustice> BUT THERE IS A SHADOW KIRBY
[3:08:04] <hntronium> Kirby B L A C K
[3:08:04] <+Aetropos> kirby is a wild card
[3:08:04] <%polaroidjackson> SHADOW KIRBY
[3:08:04] <ooblagis> NOPE
[3:08:05] <NYCrownlessKing> I ART THOU
[3:08:05] <+CaptainJax> vineSchut vineKirb
[3:08:06] <Fruitywhompus> you know damn well kirby has a dark side
[3:08:06] <+Gamerdude951> Pull that Puyo Trigger
[3:08:06] <Shisno27> Kirby the Fool
[3:08:06] <+imextremelymanly> Kirby pulling off the mask would be sick though
[3:08:08] <%yeknomlive> Kirby already has the wild card
[3:08:08] <+nova12833> Will he only have arsene or will he pokemon trainer and have multiple persona
[3:08:09] <wired_soul> THERE SHOULD BE
[3:08:09] <l4dy_luck> Kirby already accepted his true self.
[3:08:09] <NYCrownlessKing> THOU ART I
[3:08:09] <Billyuppercut0> Evil Kirby
[3:08:10] <SchroedingersFerret> Kirby is a pure boi
[3:08:10] <+Cobalt_Racer> you forget kirby from amazing mirror!
[3:08:11] <DannyMcgee> Kirby is just pure unfiltered good.
[3:08:11] <+Nephthyz> @WoolieVersus What about the shadow kirbies in Link's Awakening?
[3:08:12] <FoxInABeret> Poyosona!
[3:08:12] <$laphyrion> Kirby's Persona Arcana is THE WORLD.
[3:08:12] <pwnhills> THERE IS A SHADOW KIRBY
[3:08:12] <+TruSpindash> Shadow Kirby is the same as regular Kirby
[3:08:13] <%zephyr201> Kirby's other self is too wholesome
[3:08:13] <DotDusk> Shadow Kirby is a terrifying idea
[3:08:13] <+cuttlecrow> rbzGun
[3:08:13] <KaStarArtBLAH> the pink black hole
[3:08:13] <umbypokochan> he'd make friends with all of them
[3:08:14] <shadowlily1112> isn't there literally a shadow kirby in the GBA games?
[3:08:15] <Laecerelius> Kirby must confront the pain of losing his cake!
[3:08:15] <cielrayze> so kirby can lift mjolnir
[3:08:15] <+Cigwynn> Kirby has to fight Woolie to unlock his persona LUL
[3:08:17] <+bobfriskit> I AM POYO, POYO IS THOUGH
[3:08:18] <nobleman1992> did i come in at the end?
[3:08:19] <zaitje> A pure good boy
[3:08:19] <+Malogor> Shadow Kirby is Meta Knight, even has glowing yellow eyes
[3:08:19] <hntronium> Kirbevil
[3:08:21] <Legendary2Bass> His smashes are persona
[3:08:22] <%MONSTRx_x> succ them all
[3:08:23] <zafooru> kirby is the wild card
[3:08:23] <pillowwasp> Marx mansion though
[3:08:24] <%Tracazoid> Shadow Kirby and Kirby would just be best friend and there would be two godbeings of pure goodness.
[3:08:25] <+SeaBassTheLad> moon2SMUG darn moom moon subs ruining my SBFR experience
[3:08:26] <alexandrecau> kirby is too well balanced
[3:08:29] <+zanzibar_junker> I was feeding the cat but are we switching games?
[3:08:29] <Tyrant_Bahamut> I AM A POYO, THE TRUE SELF
[3:08:30] <FangShiro> Waluigi comes out
[3:08:30] <PokeyMcFork> yeah, shadow kirby is exactly the same personality as regular kirby
[3:08:31] <+cvp5127> shadow was in amazing mirror tho
[3:08:31] <%yeknomlive> kirby is a persona
[3:08:33] <+Nephthyz> Shadow Kirbies were a thing in Zelda tho.
[3:08:33] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> Maybe the Void Soul is Shadow Kirby
[3:08:36] <FruitopiaFred> I hope one of the next characters they add in Smash is a mech from Daemon X Machina
[3:08:36] <AdrianBauer> be like kirby
[3:08:37] <%polaroidjackson> adorable
[3:08:37] <+Remery_> Kirby is pure and he will succ any and everything metroidGasm metroidGasm metroidGasm
[3:08:38] <DartonLance> So what would happen if kirby ate the reaper
[3:08:39] <PhantomMaskJr> There is a Shadow Kirby Woolie wolfsREE shotoRyyy
[3:08:46] <+nova12833> But kirby is the obresive force like in Shadow labyrinth
[3:08:47] <Wildbold> He is immune to any form of doubt
[3:08:49] <+CaptainJax> yaldabaoth aint shit
[3:08:51] <%Joestar1890> Is Kirby the Fool or the World?
[3:08:54] <+SeaBassTheLad> I love the Kirby light
[3:08:54] <ooblagis> I've seen the end of this DLC, and Woolie is hard wrong. Kirby definitley has the potential for something else going on inside
[3:08:54] <+TruSpindash> Kirby is Broken
[3:08:54] <AggsMK7> Oh dip
[3:08:55] <Cthulos> Kirby wa Kirby
[3:08:55] <Lokuul> Kirby Silent Hill go.
[3:08:55] <Niney_Who> Kirby would EAT GOD
[3:08:55] <42nfl19> IS THAT A BOOBY MOUSEPAD?
[3:08:57] <bsmusic> PogChamp PogChamp
[3:08:57] <+chiluzza> KIRBY LITERALLY STRONGER THEN GOD
[3:08:59] <Niney_Who> vineKirb
[3:08:59] <%yeknomlive> so if kirby was in inaba could he just succ all the fog away
[3:08:59] <Darthkitten_Prime> Kirby's Persona is Dark Matter
[3:09:00] <deviljhojho94> DAMN RIGHT
[3:09:00] <+Walopoh> sbfpYeyeye sbfpDattebayo sbfpMember sbfpGreen
[3:09:01] <+robertwlewis> vineKirb most op character ever created next to god
[3:09:01] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> Woolie never say never shadows are bosses
[3:09:02] <$skullomaniaskullo> KIRBY IS OP
[3:09:02] <+TsunamiPoro> Kirby confirmed stronger than god
[3:09:03] <+silencieux7> I love those headphones
[3:09:04] <itesket> what are those headphones
[3:09:05] <mechanical_mayhem> The dark side of kirby is Void Termina
[3:09:05] <KruelDestiny> Did Kirby pull a Kami? 🤔
[3:09:05] <Synchroscheme> Kirby gets Mara
[3:09:06] <$LuisKingKing> So Kirby can survive silent hill and even just chill there
[3:09:06] <PinkSocks> But SMT demons aren't of the same nature as Persona enemies, Woolie
[3:09:07] <Billyuppercut0> Shadow Kirby is just Kirby but way more incompetent
[3:09:09] <SkewerSTARSTREAM> Kirby is The Universe!
[3:09:10] <ChucklinNarwhal> When will we get THAT Kirby lore episode?
[3:09:11] <Legendary2Bass> He's too PURE for a persona.
[3:09:11] <DatAsuna> He's definitely a demon
[3:09:14] <Lokuul> Kirby is actually just a Persona. What would his stats be?
[3:09:16] <snake_zen> @WoolieVersus DOES KIRBY HAVE THE SPIRIT OF REBELLION?
[3:09:17] <+bobfriskit> YOUR POYO DEEPENS
[3:09:23] <%Lupus_Fide> Kirby is God
[3:09:25] <gustavozxd> persona is too pure for him
[3:09:26] <VanLynx> shadow kirby is kirby but full
[3:09:26] <+Totally_not_toby> LMAO blown up
[3:09:27] <+Solshine11> Kirby cares not for the collective unconsciousness
[3:09:30] <+SeaBassTheLad> Kirbo wins again
[3:09:31] <KaStarArtBLAH> @WoolieVersus Love you <3
[3:09:32] <+lozscat> PULL MY POYO TRIGGER
[3:09:35] <+Walopoh> Vinesauce
[3:09:36] <+captain_history> Kirby would wreck Nyarly
[3:09:37] <nobleman1992> Kirby is better at making friends than Sora
[3:09:37] <AggsMK7> BigMooney is pretty good
[3:09:37] <+allups> jescox is great at it
[3:09:38] <itesket> woolie
[3:09:40] <edward11231> Vinny

[3:09:50] <DatAsuna> Depends on the game and person both

[3:09:53] <Niney_Who> vineLUL
[3:09:53] <hoghoncho> you can, but its easier with a partner
[3:09:57] <+PlayKingdomHeartsGames> No one can carry a BLIND solo LP
[3:09:57] <%ozzyzak> john wolfe
[3:09:58] <b1gboss007> mathew mattosis LP of DMC is a masterpiece
[3:09:59] <virgil757> Cryotic!
[3:10:01] <Darren716> Chugga, Proton
[3:10:01] <Billyuppercut0> Binyot is good
[3:10:02] <%sylveonIRL> vinny and joel are god tier
[3:10:03] <+zanzibar_junker> I love Cryoatic Yakuza 0 LP
[3:10:08] <grayjammer> Supegreatfriend can carry a solo, but he chooses games he would be good at LPing
[3:10:08] <%Jpdodds> NintendoCapriSun
[3:10:10] <1101lovelace> Shoutout to Vash12349.
[3:10:11] <WiseOldFoolishDingo> Plague did it well, and it only cost him his sanity
[3:10:12] <%MadameColeen> aren't most lps solo?
[3:10:12] <+RichardRasmus> ive heard good things about christopher odd but ive never watched
[3:10:13] <%ozzyzak> NCS is cool
[3:10:15] <+zanzibar_junker> no wait livestream
[3:10:15] <%sylveonIRL> a lot of the vinesauce team is good tbh
[3:10:15] <KruelDestiny> coxDerp plan
[3:10:16] <buffmurffy> vinny is good with weird other stuff to add to the stream
[3:10:17] <+Solshine11> RISINGSUPERSTREAM?
[3:10:21] <CrackerJack450> BANG BANG BANG PULL MY POYO TRIGGER
[3:10:21] <+KanjiTatsumi> Doing a solo LP is better for streaming since you at least have a chat to bounce things off of
[3:10:22] <cornerstorecoroner> FBtouchdown
[3:10:24] <Darren716> like all the clasic lpers are single
[3:10:24] <+robertwlewis> Vinesauce doesn’t do his own editing
[3:10:25] <$SulfurousAcid> @grayjammer hell yeah SuperGreatFriend
[3:10:26] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> flashbacks to Reboot LP
[3:10:26] <+zanzibar_junker> DO A JUDGE EYES STREAM WOOLIE
[3:10:26] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> Vargskelethor crazy sweadish guy joel from vinesauce
[3:10:27] <+LogothX> Plague does it well because he's PLAGUE.
[3:10:33] <%ozzyzak> lucajin
[3:10:34] <hntronium> That's what your draw is Woolie
[3:10:37] <nothuzad> BTW woolie did you get to try out "HADES" the new rougelite form Supergiant Games? :)

[3:10:42] <+Gamerdude951> LPs are just reaction channels but for video games
[3:10:46] <Niney_Who> @WoolieVersus Thanks for getting me into my undeniable love of "Hype Wrestling Moves"
[3:10:47] <+democrazyyy> will woolie ever dip his toes into kingdom hearts again? the parking lot beckons
[3:10:48] <%Vidsigma> I think Stephen of StephenPlays does the whole solo LP stuff really well.
[3:10:49] <+DeadpanSoupcan> you can go off on tangents and show videos during your streams
[3:10:49] <edward11231> Vinny murdered a dog and horse within 10 minutes today in the worst possible way
[3:10:51] <+cvp5127> just hire a script writer
[3:10:55] <KruelDestiny> @allups coxMuppet i see you
[3:10:56] <Fenrirlives> Plague is niche but the Darksouls playthrough has a ton of merit
[3:10:59] <captainthunderwolf> @Darren716 A lot of older guys do group stuff also, though, like Chip and Ironicus.
[3:11:00] <+FackinCrazy> WoolieVs Yakuza 0
[3:11:03] <marklarphd> Hey Woolie
[3:11:03] <umbypokochan> this is why you need a cat

[3:11:10] <+JellybraTV> ping pong vs racket ball
[3:11:10] <$cherubsanonymous> <3
[3:11:11] <Dalkalopagus> solo is a lot easier with post-commentary over a pre-edited video
[3:11:13] <+zanzibar_junker> Yeah Woolie VS Yakuza 0
[3:11:15] <Dragonfang1337> Bouncing conversations with an entire chatroom really helps a lot
[3:11:15] <+Fenlig> I really enjoyed reboot!
[3:11:15] <faytthepally> Now all i can think of is Kirby doing that dumb boomer dance to Devil Trigger

[4:38:44] <ooblagis> Nioh is hard, until you get OP and steam roll with zero effort
[4:38:44] <Zeon_Ace> Nioh is great but balls hard.
[4:38:44] <+TsunamiPoro> But actually just play Bayo
[4:38:45] <+Dimfish> nioh is fucking GREAT
[4:38:46] <%D2_Synua> Nioh is the 3rd best Dark Souls
[4:38:46] <PlagueasusPlays> I know that was like a week ago.
[4:38:48] <+Nomenanza> Nioh aka Geralt goes to Japan to find his waifu
[4:38:48] <+Frankyzappa> Nioh's cool, not at athe level of Souls but it's legit
[4:38:48] <%thisisacoolguy> Is Woolie saying that his videos are a shitpost because he's afraid to admit he takes lore seriously and is using it as a excuse for when he gets things wrong? Theory
[4:38:50] <TheyCallMeVawn> Niohs like if you combined Souls and Ninja Gaiden
[4:38:51] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> it's very long
[4:38:56] <+Wselfwulf_Derp> I really couldn't finish Nioh. Really long for what it was.
[4:38:57] <silvcrest> Man fuck Nioh
[4:38:59] <+Zombino924> Woolie should play Katamari
[4:39:01] <+zanzibar_junker> Nioh is good but the DLC is HAD AS FUCK
[4:39:03] <DatAsuna> You won't see that content till postgame.
[4:39:04] <%MrDrayko> SO much dlc
[4:39:08] <gnarly_memes_bro> its a fun game. not exactly a souls like but i enjoyed it a lot
[4:39:09] <LixFury> Nioh is darksouls but bullshit

[4:39:27] <Superdandy96> Hey Woolie, have you thought about playing some for Honor in the future?
[4:39:28] <Xelhesia> @WoolieVersus hey woolie, would you play yakuza 0 or judge eyes to commemorate your tattoo when its done?
[4:39:29] <TheyCallMeVawn> Niohs DLC is hard as fuck. Gotta farm that those levels and gear upgrades.
[4:39:30] <+thealchemistoftime> "ass beat on stream"-woolie
[4:39:31] <%thisisacoolguy> everyone is streaming bayo for whatever reason I'd rather Katamari

[4:39:39] <gnarly_memes_bro> i feel bad for anyone going back now without exploits tho , some of the bosses are bullshit
[4:39:40] <Shisno27> Hell yeah Katamari
[4:39:42] <%bigbradish> @LixFury I got to the point where I was good at it and I hated myself for it
[4:39:45] <aeonicvector> you could always get some tag ins aswell via the co-op progression
[4:39:47] <BritheOP> Katamaro would be so much fun!
[4:39:54] <+Dimfish> spear parries and pole-vaults are how you win at nioh
[4:39:55] <+Zombino924> NAAAA NANANA NA NA NA KATAMARI DAMACY
[4:39:56] <Zeon_Ace> It’s all about having the right build in Nioh or you’ll get bodied.
[4:39:56] <gnarly_memes_bro> ooh i agree with atamari
[4:40:03] <Sonicdy> everything is watchable in stream Kappa
[4:40:03] <%king_wragles> A few of us literally watched Peach/Paige gossip for like 45 minutes and it was great
[4:40:03] <+Nomenanza> Jokes aside Nioh is great for at least making you interact with the enemies' stamina bars

[4:47:04] <BritheOP> It's the most comprehensive for sure.
[4:47:05] <+Nomenanza> I see that fucking Albino Kirbi
[4:47:06] <%RioGascar> How many kirby games ARE THERE???
[4:47:07] <%thisisacoolguy> (Robobot is the best)
[4:47:07] <Megapikman132> nah, but it's top 3
[4:47:07] <+VektorTroika> can confirm soulja boi compatability
[4:47:07] <gnarly_memes_bro> @Kulahan AYYY MY FUCCIN GUY air rid is the GOAT
[4:47:09] <+TruSpindash> Thats not Air Ride
[4:47:11] <+AncientToco> The day I bought Super Star Ultra was such a good day
[4:47:11] <+trnzero> Loved this game as akid
[4:47:13] <%thisisacoolguy> but super star is the ultimate starter
[4:47:14] <nina9669> TPFufun TPFufun TPFufun TPFufun TPFufun TPFufun TPFufun TPFufun TPFufun TPFufun TPFufun TPFufun TPFufun TPFufun TPFufun TPFufun TehePelo TehePelo TehePelo TehePelo TehePelo TehePelo TehePelo TehePelo TehePelo TehePelo TehePelo
[4:47:15] <prime_name> @WoolieVersus But what's the worst Kirby Game?
[4:47:15] <Superdandy96> Got a copy of it. Super good.
[4:47:17] <Kulahan> @gnarly_memes_bro DID WE JUST BECOME BEST FRIENDS!?
[4:47:18] <+JackMillerTime> holy shit hes right
[4:47:18] <+mar2503> does not introduce city trial tho
[4:47:20] <edward11231> DId Sakurai make Super Star, Chat?
[4:47:22] <%king_wragles> @WoolieVersus Woolie the Liar forsakes Crystal Shards due to how it's THE BEST
[4:47:23] <Swish19XX> Or the orignal SNES Superstar if you hate handhelds
[4:47:24] <+mechslayer71> I actually had that on DS
[4:47:26] <%thisisacoolguy> Epic Yarn is the worse
[4:47:28] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> Nah dreamland is basic kirby
[4:47:28] <nina9669> TPFufun TPFufun TPFufun TPFufun TPFufun TPFufun TPFufun TPFufun TPFufun TPFufun TPFufun TPFufun TPFufun TPFufun TPFufun TPFufun TPFufun TehePelo TehePelo TehePelo TehePelo TehePelo TehePelo TehePelo TehePelo TehePelo TehePelo TehePelo TehePelo TehePelo TehePelo TehePelo TehePelo TehePelo TehePelo TehePelo TehePelo TehePelo TehePelo
[4:47:33] <mothdude> But most importantly it introduces Bandana Waddle Dee.
[4:47:34] <Mythundare> Is it the Symphony of Kirby games?
[4:47:36] <+ButterShutter> i grew up playing squeak squad and it's still my favorite kirby game
[4:47:36] <Shady_Zaku> Good think I got that game recently!
[4:47:38] <$skullomaniaskullo> Ahh yes the OG. Bloodborne
[4:47:38] <+lozscat> OK So what’s the Worst One?
[4:47:38] <odd_slater> @edward11231 Yes
[4:47:40] <+KanjiTatsumi> Kirby Super Star Ultra is the Rosetta Stone of Kirby games
[4:47:41] <%Menitta> @prime_name Probably Rainbow Curse and even then it;s fine
[4:47:42] <%TsunamiPoro> Also its just fun as fuck
[4:47:42] <%xXichibanballer> I need fast kirby
[4:47:45] <+skylerpilot> Super Star created the smash bros bubble shields!
[4:47:46] <%Joestar1890> @edward11231 Nope, he made Super Star vanilla
[4:47:49] <+KilogramHours> BANDANA DEE
[4:47:49] <BritheOP> Honestly... None of them are really bad.

[4:53:18] <+Floofiie> @WoolieVersus What are your workout days?
[4:53:20] <grayjammer> The only issue I have with that chart is there's no direct route from SSU to RTD
[4:53:21] <+griffball13> @WoolieVersus don't forget lore
[4:53:23] <bunnicco> was that the next lore video
[4:53:23] <%linkwolf4> the important thing is that there is no such thing as a bad kirby game

[4:53:39] <+MagickBurritoh> Professor Punch
[4:53:41] <Billyuppercut0> Enter hell
[4:53:41] <gnarly_memes_bro> My problem with the chart is that all paths don't end at air ride
[4:53:42] <furretposting> @twohitgood star allies is fanservice as fuck, so its probably something you should play after a lot of other kirby
[4:53:42] <bunnicco> GET READY FOR AN ASS KICKING

[4:54:29] <torusendor> I WILL CONSUME ALL
[4:54:31] <yehdinh> @WoolieVersus If a fan who is also experienced with boxing challenges you to a spar, would you be down?
[4:54:32] <%Zombino924> Marx is freaky in SSBU

[4:54:41] <AHandito> What could possibly go wrong picking Marx?
[4:54:43] <TyrantBelial> NO, THEY AREN'T STRONG ENOUGH.
[4:54:47] <Futurecity10> why is marx a friend? didnt he become literal satan?
[4:54:50] <GreatestGuess> Time for a revolution, comrades.
[4:54:51] <%thisisacoolguy> they are strong
[4:54:51] <Rexwarrior1> I live you Woolie
[4:54:53] <digitialdemidevil> This might be a mental helth playthrough, I just left and watched the finale of Gridman
[4:54:53] <bunnicco> shh, let him learn
[4:54:56] <+Taisuru> I wish the buddies didn't get recolored
[4:54:57] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> TRIPLE D
[4:54:57] <%DRAGKUDO> Marx came back to help Kirby
[4:55:00] <+tigerfang86> @Futurecity10 Kirby knows how to forgive a lot
[4:55:02] <+cuttlecrow> he'll back here
[4:55:03] <%thisisacoolguy> Marx is only a friend because he doesn't want to die
[4:55:04] <+ElEversoris> metaknight dedede and adelaine
[4:55:04] <%Zombino924> Friends through violence
[4:55:05] <The_Swedish_X> @Futurecity10 He got better.
[4:55:06] <alexandrecau> the OG 3 and the team killer
[4:55:07] <captainthunderwolf> @Futurecity10 Kirby has become Conquest, none may defy his will now.
[4:55:09] <$skullomaniaskullo> Punch Daddy!
[4:55:10] <%Menitta> do Dark Meta
[4:55:10] <Greywolf47> marx may have tried to kill kirby but it's fine he's not dead
[4:55:14] <+tigerfang86> I NEED MORE POWER
[4:55:15] <Shade075> DE m6kwD3 DE m6kwD3 DE
[4:55:15] <bunnicco> dmk then
[4:55:15] <mothdude> Marx turned good after Kirby fed him some food.
[4:55:17] <furretposting> you just broke meta knights heart
[4:55:17] <+ElEversoris> OG three
[4:55:19] <thewhiterice92> needs more POWER
[4:55:19] <Megapikman132> Meta Knight is great when being played
[4:55:20] <%onlystrykerfan> Dark Meta Knight is OP
[4:55:20] <bunnicco> I NEED MORE POWER
[4:55:21] <Retrocop87> Meta Knight needs MORE POWER
[4:55:21] <%thisisacoolguy> Meta Knight is very strong what the heck
[4:55:22] <Greywolf47> so they are friends Kappa
[4:55:25] <%mistspade> But meta knight always OP.
[4:55:25] <Overloard> are there two meta knights in that list ?
[4:55:26] <edward11231> You'll need a healer
[4:55:26] <Megapikman132> As an AI, ehhhhhhh
[4:55:27] <%Nitsuj293> Dark Meta is just better meta
[4:55:32] <VritraReiRei> @WoolieVersus i would replace Vivi for Adeleine
[4:55:33] <Mythundare> Not strong enough for this game for babies LUL
[4:55:33] <Arek_1> Dark Meta Knight is where it's at.
[4:55:37] <+moranprime> They nerfed Meta Knight this much? Kappa
[4:55:37] <+AXL808> you're going to want a healer
[4:55:38] <ken_kuma> @WoolieVersus Metaknight has a strong as hell counter
[4:55:38] <+ElEversoris> not metaknight. i meant bandana dee
[4:55:38] <%DRAGKUDO> Marx is the Vegeta to Kirby's Gok
[4:55:44] <+BishopBain> This final boss whooped my ass quite a few times.
[4:55:44] <vergil_angelo> Do Dedede, Waddle Dee and Adeleine, team 64
[4:55:47] <%thisisacoolguy> MEta Knight got a new counter and he destroys stuff
[4:55:52] <alexandrecau> Marx is freeza

[5:02:58] <Megapikman132> @WoolieVersus Don't forget that 2nd phase lore!
[5:03:00] <+JavaManJoJo> how do you make meta knight even edgier
[5:03:01] <%thisisacoolguy> Magolor is legit the strongest character in the game @WoolieVersus
[5:03:04] <Arek_1> LKD.
[5:03:06] <$leobukan> Mangalore has black hole
[5:03:09] <gnarly_memes_bro> this team looks like a middle school art club
[5:03:09] <+GabeSweetMan> Marx is the most OP ever.
[5:03:11] <GurrenPrime> check the description on phase 2?

[5:03:25] <Kalcom> love my blanka
[5:03:26] <VritraReiRei> @WoolieVersus also, dont forget that the more allies you have, the more health the boss has. doing it with just you and adeliene is quite fine
[5:03:32] <+KilogramHours> PHASE LORE
[5:03:32] <CynicalGrey> THEY NEED MORE POWER
[5:03:32] <Superdandy96> Hammer bro all the way
[5:03:35] <$SulfurousAcid> plasma hurts my fingers after a bit
[5:03:37] <%king_wragles> @WoolieVersus you can also charge while blocking
[5:03:37] <ooblagis> Plasma requires too much time wasted, you need to actually dodge for once
[5:03:38] <chaozagents> Marx, Magalor, and Dark Metaknight are super stronk
[5:03:38] <tacostarvedbeast> Chucking dat plasma
[5:03:45] <%thisisacoolguy> Magolor is busted because he's i-frames 99% of the time and invincible to projectiles
[5:03:46] <$skullomaniaskullo> Punch daddy use hammer
[5:03:46] <+cuttlecrow> Stone is the cheesy way of doing it
[5:03:51] <%deadredeyez> good luck
[5:03:54] <%thisisacoolguy> and his air dodge lets him just erase his hurtbox
[5:03:58] <+claudesavegely> you should add element to their weapons
[5:03:59] <xoyv> adeleine and ribbon kind of ate it several times, possibly replacing them with chef kawasaski for extra heals?
[5:04:04] <+ItsRatman> Awesome I made it
[5:04:05] <+tigerfang86> NINJA ART
[5:04:10] <+gutlesscoward> was that adeling riding a giant ninja
[5:04:14] <+cuttlecrow> @WoolieVersus the more friends you bring in the higher the boss's health scales
[5:04:17] <AlertDOTEXE> What smash game is this?
[5:04:17] <ooblagis> Doing much better
[5:04:19] <%theKittenhugs> What is this boss music

[5:07:46] <%Ivyna_J_Spyder> I heard the Mafo = lie should be Mago = lie?
[5:07:48] <TurtlesAndTentacles> if you look up this game, 90% of all people watching this game being played are here.
[5:07:49] <Loxoron> @woolieversus remember to check lore each phase

[5:07:55] <%RagnorakTres> 'it's a shitpost' he says mere minutes before stopping playing the game for like 5 minutes to examine the implications on a new lore screen
[5:07:55] <%thisisacoolguy> Sakurai hasn't worked on these games since Air Ride

[5:09:30] <buffmurffy> adeleine just isnt pulling her weight
[5:09:32] <Josef_Stryker> F
[5:09:33] <$leobukan> DON´T USE A HEALER
[5:09:34] <$skullomaniaskullo> F
[5:09:36] <CynicalGrey> Adeline's health is too small
[5:09:36] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> Think you need a better healer.
[5:09:38] <+cuttlecrow> try stone with ice powered teammates @WoolieVersus
[5:09:38] <Belades1> He didn't even heal
[5:09:39] <$leobukan> USE MANGALOR
[5:09:39] <+mik255> this effectively a raid boss?
[5:09:39] <abrokenpaperclip> Well at least you got infinite 1ups
[5:09:39] <captainthunderwolf> @SolSwagGuy56 It's the last boss of Star Allies, but I think the game has a secret Hard Mode difficulty.
[5:09:40] <+MitchPfitz> reset
[5:09:40] <CynicalGrey> Try Kawasaki'
[5:09:41] <prime_name> Adelenie isn't doing her best
[5:09:42] <SolSwagGuy56> @buffmurffy but waifus
[5:09:42] <%thisisacoolguy> Woolie use Kawasaki, Ado takes too much damage due to her quirk
[5:09:42] <Evilkaz> Arent the fights easier with less friends?
[5:09:43] <Superdandy96> Use the hammer brother
[5:09:43] <SixthSun2> Adeleine isn't pulling her weight, ditch her
[5:09:43] <xoyv> breathing power wuld be good agaisnt the ball toss he does
[5:09:45] <+twohitgood> has the healer been effectively healing?
[5:09:45] <Kalcom> if you won't use the healer
[5:09:45] <+SaltyGhostRock> Painter is useless
[5:09:45] <$skullomaniaskullo> GG
[5:09:46] <+robertwlewis> Ade seems useless
[5:09:47] <CrackerJack450> @WoolieVersus GREEN STARS GIVE PLASMA
[5:09:47] <$leobukan> DON´T USE A HEALER, USE MANGALOR
[5:09:48] <%Sulliman34> boomerang?
[5:09:48] <xiccy> HOLDING ON TO WHAT I AM
[5:09:49] <Goergorion> wind and cutter?
[5:09:49] <Am_Shigar00> These last couple fights get CRAZY tough
[5:09:51] <+frobeards> why not give them elements?
[5:09:53] <bignerb> need a better healer or none at all
[5:09:53] <%Zombino924> @woolieversus LESS CHARACTER BOSS LESS HEALTH
[5:09:56] <$leobukan> YOU DON´T HAVE TIME TO HEAL
[5:09:56] <Kalcom> what the fuck
[5:09:57] <shlaggori> NO HEALER
[5:09:57] <+GabeSweetMan> NOOOOOO
[5:09:59] <+zanzibar_junker> MORE POWAH
[5:09:59] <ebonifragaria> lmao
[5:10:00] <The_Swedish_X> should probably have 1 healer
[5:10:00] <$leobukan> NO HEALER
[5:10:00] <+cvp5127> lol
[5:10:01] <VritraReiRei> @WoolieVersus suggestion, drop Dark Meta Knight and Marx so the boss has less health
[5:10:01] <pillowwasp> Ditch Adeline. Get another Marx
[5:10:01] <Overloard> Cook Pog
[5:10:03] <+ItsRatman> MORE HEALERS YES
[5:10:04] <+twohitgood> probably want more DPS and less healing

[5:58:43] <+Aetropos> fruit 2.0
[5:58:45] <Dragonfang1337> And that's how she unlocked her persona

[5:59:16] <+GabeSweetMan> Also I think most of the "frame rate" lag is mostly just the hit-stun chains.
[5:59:18] <Thirtine> SISTER VS SISTER
[5:59:21] <+Hunk_Of_Dunk> Fire's real type weakness is soda

[6:29:02] <@mothmandraws> woolie pretending the lore is a shitpost is a shitpost
[6:29:03] <+tigerfang86> STILL A SHITPOST
[6:29:05] <+tigerfang86> BUT ITS TRUE
[6:29:08] <+xS1D3SW1P3x> LIES AND DECEPTION
[6:29:08] <spawnzie> The truest lies
[6:29:09] <ebonifragaria> "Lore is a shitpost" [X] DOUBT
[6:29:13] <stranger59> Reality is nothing but lies
[6:29:14] <landsharkRAWR> my first platinum game was wonderful 101 and dmc felt very much "wow its the same game but old as fuck"
[6:29:16] <%Zombino924> Quality Shitpost
[6:29:17] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Based on fact is a shaky statement tho
[6:29:24] <gnarly_memes_bro> All of existence is a shitpost IMO
[6:29:25] <+RichardRasmus> @RioGascar i dont think there is camera control in dmc1 and i guess i just thought the camera felt fine while others dont

[6:29:31] <ZakuDude> Maybe I'm just getting old but DMC1 feels fine to me. Obviously not as a good as 3 or 4 but still good
[6:29:31] <houseguardbro> Woolie needs to play Battle Assault 3. It'd be a hilarious one.
[6:29:33] <+tigerfang86> ITS A REAL SHITPOST
[6:29:34] <JumboMan214> Facts dont care about your feelings

[6:29:52] <%ProxyJackal38> The best shitposts are the ones that are ones so real you can feel it
[6:29:53] <Dragonfang1337> It's a shitpost BECAUSE it's real
[6:29:53] <+KilogramHours> @WoolieVersus Remember the first video on WoolieVs?
[6:29:54] <Triplicat> Real Shitpost is a defining phrase of the year 2018
[6:29:55] <+mushymoto> imagine not finishing dmc 1 LUL
[6:29:55] <%linkwolf4> memes can also be facts
[6:29:57] <+floridianman> Its the bible of shitposts
[6:29:57] <+ItsAGundamu> It’s a factual shot post
[6:29:58] <DatAsuna> "he's possesed by a mirage but he's not WRONG"
[6:29:59] <%Zombino924> The implication

[7:06:06] <gnarly_memes_bro> all chat wants is lore and soda. and we've still got lots of both
[7:06:07] <+GabeSweetMan> In this part of Twitch?
[7:06:08] <+Cavumentum> He's playing 4/12 boss characters at all times
[7:06:10] <puregryphon> In this part of the country
[7:06:10] <captainthunderwolf> They look a bit like Marx's as well.
[7:06:10] <LixFury> this is Bayo af
[7:06:11] <SixthSun2> And Marx's wings @WoolieVersus
[7:06:11] <exploitativity2> maybe the HD rumble makes it better
[7:06:14] <+JenovasPuppet> sero tsu?
[7:06:16] <Kalcom> you mean marx wings?
[7:06:16] <+Cigwynn> We talking Eva Unit 02???
[7:06:17] <The_Letter_B_Eight_Times> They are kinda like a mix of 02 and Marx
[7:06:17] <heroneiden> kirby stinger combo
[7:06:17] <+gutlesscoward> toe to tip, that is a zero-two
[7:06:17] <byobuer> moon zero two?
[7:06:19] <ebonifragaria> This music isn't nearly as cool as O2's in 64
[7:06:20] <chaozagents> This boss has so many references I love it
[7:06:20] <%Sulliman34> like a mix of Marx and 02
[7:06:21] <+GabeSweetMan> Localized entirely in this stream?!
[7:06:21] <%Niney_Who> Wow Woolie I didn't know Darling in the Franxx was connected to Kirby Kappa
[7:06:22] <%FistOfMonkey> DARLING!!!
[7:06:24] <gnarly_memes_bro> is this drakengard 4?
[7:06:24] <Kalcom> you mean like magolor stars?

[7:06:32] <Kalcom> you mean like everything
[7:06:35] <danknugglit> Use your kubi to kill this narutomen
[7:06:35] <Loxoron> Any final boss that has wings kinda looks that way tbh, which is cooler @WoolieVersus
[7:06:36] <%FistOfMonkey> wrong zero 2?
[7:06:36] <%Sulliman34> its all cyclical
[7:06:38] <Artista_AF> & the same tile pattern as full form Marx's
[7:06:39] <Kuzunoha_raihou> KIRBY ITS THE DARK SOULS OF SAKURAI GAMES
[7:06:41] <edward11231> I wonder if these attack get harder to dodge Kappa
[7:06:42] <+Rezca> Is Kirby the Dark Souls before Dark Souls?
[7:06:42] <+LogothX> Like Half Life 2's GMAN
[7:06:43] <+OdysseyKnight> Would that actually make Souls a Kirbylike in lore?
[7:06:44] <+KanjiTatsumi> Yeah
[7:06:45] <+mostbrokenrobo> DAHLING
[7:06:46] <DeepSeaman> comparing any OST to Crystal Shards ain't fair
[7:06:48] <wulfsbane_jolt> is this when Sorairo Days starts playing?
[7:06:48] <ebonifragaria> Kirby is the Dark Souls of Dark Souls
[7:06:50] <alexandrecau> they want baller enemies

[7:07:12] <%FistOfMonkey> DAHLING!!!
[7:07:12] <captainthunderwolf> Kirby is just The Legend of Zelda. Lots of recurrent themes but no completely concrete grasp on the united setting.
[7:07:13] <+Clyderso> May I see it?
[7:07:13] <chaozagents> I want an Axe Kirby
[7:07:14] <lewdskeletor13> The incest was more interesting than the answers
[7:07:14] <+NWR_James> Or did HAL just not want to make a new moveset
[7:07:14] <mothdude> All the Soul bosses have similar move patterns.
[7:07:18] <ebonifragaria> The ol' Homestuck-a-roo
[7:07:21] <puregryphon> No
[7:07:25] <exploitativity2> no, the one from darling in the franxx
[7:07:27] <Cthulos> Same character designer? Kappa
[7:07:30] <+Tee_Ehh> Oh so not Darling in the Franxx @WoolieVersus
[7:07:31] <Zourath> Is Kirby the Kirby of Kirby Games?
[7:07:36] <%gantz_zero> zero two from Franxx obvously
[7:07:36] <+Order_of_Mystery> See also: The Soul of Cinders
[7:07:37] <edward11231> Did someone say Homestuck Kappa
[7:07:37] <+Cigwynn> OH!

[7:07:45] <mechanical_mayhem> Kirby Zero Two only good Zero Two
[7:07:46] <bignerb> darling in the franxx u mean knock off evangelion Kappa
[7:07:49] <AHandito> I feel like Sakurai loves games and wants to highlight the things he loves about them, so the people that learn from him pick up the same mentality.
[7:07:53] <%ProxyJackal38> rainbow bridge based axe?
[7:07:54] <+pixelkenj> I cant believe Kirby stole from anime

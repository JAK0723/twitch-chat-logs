[0:03:25] <DaBigVitus> this the final stretch for the strand type game
[0:03:28] <worldbrand> This is da big one
[0:03:37] <+ConLin_Arts_> He could probably finish it
[0:03:39] <+Apokrypton> heres da big wun
[0:04:00] <@Solidus_113> Not finishing today
[0:04:01] <+mrhandsss> yeah. next one too. sucks its gotta be in halves though. i could not stop once i got to the tar belt. in that regard, they already showed more restraint by stopping where they did last time
[0:04:03] <Graxe_> Oh yeah
[0:04:11] <+Apokrypton> where's he at rn?
[0:04:12] <Graxe_> Woolie's Apex/Overwatch FPS config
[0:04:18] <Graxe_> Of half controller, half mouse
[0:04:30] <+ConLin_Arts_> he crossed the tar belt
[0:04:32] <@Solidus_113> He's about to bring on Edge Knot
[0:04:43] <@Solidus_113> so we got STUFF
[0:04:43] <+Apokrypton> oh yeah there's no way this is the stream then
[0:04:45] <MyNameIsRasus> Do you guys think we will get to that extremely hype part today tho?
[0:04:53] <@Solidus_113> yes
[0:04:54] <worldbrand> Oh i see
[0:05:00] <+ConLin_Arts_> shush
[0:05:05] <worldbrand> wow jeez
[0:05:06] <+Apokrypton> yeah valid sorry
[0:05:07] <+linSP> yeah edge that knot
[0:05:18] <MyNameIsRasus> Edge my BabyKnot
[0:05:23] <MalformedMalice> Was getting ready to send in job applications, guess I will have to be a happy jobless shitlord for the meanwhile
[0:05:31] <+ConLin_Arts_> hehe
[0:06:13] <+Apokrypton> but yeah if he wants to finish it today he could it'd just be a long ass stream
[0:06:18] <+mrhandsss> i assume next stream is end to beat the game, not factoring cleanup
[0:06:27] <%Ecchigun> woolieWHENS
[0:06:43] <@Solidus_113> I sure hope all of you kickstarted Wonderful 101
[0:06:52] <MyNameIsRasus> woolieWHENS woolieWHENS
[0:06:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> GeneralSCPatton subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! I'm so glad that you enjoy the mechanics of bypassing traversal using cool shit and hard prep work, since you were initially skeptical on the podcast. And I'm even more glad that you've embraced the power of grind.
[0:06:59] <%The_Timo> @WoolieVersus I have you on full volume at work because everyone else decided to work from home today lol. Alone in the office watching WoolieVs while polishing my game. What a day this'll be
[0:07:31] <+chase959> is this a short stream or is he sitting down to finish the game this session?
[0:07:49] <+jiggy_snipe> short stream. next one will be the finale
[0:07:55] <%Solidnick18> SourPls
[0:08:06] <+BionoidLCR> SourPls
[0:08:12] <+mrhandsss> i'd say it looks like they goin for platinum, but there's 1 thing keepin them from doing that
[0:08:15] <%Exiliator> SourPls
[0:08:15] <+BionoidLCR> Athena show me that psycho sword
[0:08:17] <$eco419> AYAYA
[0:08:22] <+Apokrypton> what's that one thing, hands?
[0:08:26] <+mrhandsss> you need a certain amount of "legends of legends" deliveries
[0:08:31] <+Apokrypton> oh jesus
[0:08:34] <StarlitStunner> doodOne doodOne doodOne
[0:08:35] <+mrhandsss> you cant get those unless u play on hard
[0:08:43] <%Ecchigun> duDudu
[0:09:13] <+linSP> i thought LoL rank was for s ranking premium deliveries
[0:09:16] <+mrhandsss> now, its actually easy since they can beat the game, change difficulty, and then go for that. deliveries dont get harder, its just enemies
[0:09:21] <+Superbro64> oh hey, physco ball rap
[0:09:32] <+mrhandsss> s ranking premium on hardest difficulty, yes
[0:09:36] <+Superbro64> dj dicks really does need to rise from his grave
[0:09:51] <+Superbro64> I think the artist does stuff under a seperate alias though now
[0:09:57] <heroicspiritavenger> WISE FWOM YO GWAVE
[0:09:58] <+jiggy_snipe> yea Mag.Lo
[0:10:12] <+Apokrypton> pixel woolie is strong

[0:13:15] <+Apokrypton> bitrate too big
[0:13:15] <+duneblythe> w101
[0:13:20] <alrobot2014> oh yeah you guys do look more detailed
[0:13:24] <xXxPS9xXx> Reality cant handle the woolie rendering, time to upgrage the cosmic GPU
[0:13:24] <zayasu> thanks sony
[0:13:31] <MalformedMalice> Y'all have great hair tho <3
[0:13:37] <acedeone> looks good!
[0:13:38] <alrobot2014> oh you've smoothed out a bit
[0:13:39] <%Exiliator> Th-Theyre moving too fast! I cant keep up! It looks like theyre jumping through time!
[0:13:40] <Graxe_> Image quality is real good, though
[0:13:40] <%mrhandsss> mrhandsss subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:13:41] <AMaidIndeed> Trade health for more time on the clock!
[0:13:43] <@Solidus_113> classy
[0:13:46] <MyNameIsRasus> Reggie looking fresh
[0:13:47] <%wydamn> wait, you guys have beards?
[0:13:57] <%The_Timo> I'm debating which tier to back w101 at. I can't help it. I want it all!
[0:14:02] <%GeneralSCPatton> @xxxps9xxx Reality is a Chrome web app? AND IT'S PEGGING ONE CORE?
[0:14:03] <Guardiansaiyan> BIG NUMBER
[0:14:05] <Guardiansaiyan> NO COMBO
[0:14:08] <heroicspiritavenger> The metal wind screen/pop filter is only really good if you’re a singer anyway
[0:14:11] <+linSP> i cant believe the 101 people who bought w101 raised 600k
[0:14:12] <%LordSDB> Stream is still choppy but sound is good
[0:14:21] <%Ecchigun> YO
[0:14:26] <%Ecchigun> BETTER CAMERA FEED ?
[0:14:29] <derap41> @LordSDB might be the camera not the stream
[0:14:36] <%LordSDB> gotcha
[0:14:38] <heroicspiritavenger> @linsp has it not broken 1m yet?
[0:14:38] <%Ecchigun> i finally see reggie beautiful eyes
[0:14:44] <Guardiansaiyan> I can see Woolies TV screen from the reflection on the glass
[0:14:50] <DavidDredd84> Finna beat the game today?
[0:15:02] <%jepupu> I'm not sure if I want to watch this or play by myself
[0:15:03] <%Exiliator> Next step for Reggie is getting dreads, then he's ready to finally defeat Woolie and take the main spot
[0:15:07] <+linSP> @heroicspiritavenger its been more than a day so probably
[0:15:09] <@chesterr01> @ecchigun 😍
[0:15:14] <MalformedMalice> I havent been keeping up on the uploads and haven't played Death Stranding. Don't wanna leave though cuz this is my first woolie live show
[0:15:22] <xXxPS9xXx> @GeneralSCPatton worse than that, reality is a chrome app pegging one core running on a virtual machine with no hardware GPU support, it's real bad lol
[0:15:23] <derap41> Jesus I can see the pores in your faces
[0:15:28] <%mrhandsss> i would say point of no return is when they go back to lake knot
[0:15:30] <+Apokrypton> @jepupu the end of the game doesn't gain a ton from actually being played, but most the game does
[0:15:30] <%Solidnick18> @chesterr01 woolieREGGIEFUL woolieCHAN
[0:15:30] <MyNameIsRasus> Good plan
[0:15:33] <Guardiansaiyan> thats the QUALITY content, not pores
[0:15:35] <derap41> This camera is grea
[0:15:36] <@Solidus_113> we'll let you know
[0:15:40] <acedeone> you'll get that kojimaesque aaaahhhhhuhhhhhhh??
[0:15:43] <Dingo_Eejit> Arghh, the more you move the choppier it gets. It's like my LED lights
[0:15:52] <%Solidnick18> yeah
[0:16:19] <heroicspiritavenger> DON’T FUCK UP @solidus_113
[0:16:20] <@Solidus_113> it's not that
[0:16:27] <heroicspiritavenger> YOU’RE ON NOTICE
[0:16:29] <+linSP> doing the final pizza is the real point of no return
[0:16:29] <derap41> woolieDATTEBAYO_RA
[0:16:34] <+agumon9000> Kinda
[0:16:37] <powerprotoman> its kojima woolie
[0:16:40] <%Solidnick18> sort of
[0:16:41] <+Apokrypton> it's a little vague tbh
[0:16:50] <+agumon9000> No
[0:16:51] <+drawdehellfire> hey, whose that role model next to you?
[0:16:53] <derap41> It going to be pretty obvious
[0:16:55] <+agumon9000> It requires a big trip
[0:16:55] <@Solidus_113> it could be obvious, if you can hold yourself back from wanting to continue
[0:16:55] <%The_Timo> Oh God I just rechecked w101 kickstarter, over 1.5 million CAD raised haha
[0:16:56] <%bread_assassin> It's pretty clear-cit
[0:16:59] <+Apokrypton> there's a soft stopping point and a Hard stopping point
[0:16:59] <acedeone> there will be a moment
[0:16:59] <%bread_assassin> *cut
[0:17:01] <+vibbon> Woolie sporting that Arizona green tea hoodie
[0:17:02] <%supersugoisenpai1> not really
[0:17:03] <MalformedMalice> I still have no idea what the fresh hell Death Stranding is

[0:17:41] <%mrhandsss> i did the pizza before what i would consider to be "point of no return"
[0:17:42] <heroicspiritavenger> @malformedmalice the extinction event in game or the game itself?
[0:17:44] <%supersugoisenpai1> Hug of no return

[0:18:23] <%GeneralSCPatton> Absorb the cliffhanger energy
[0:18:29] <heroicspiritavenger> @malformedmalice the core gameplay loop is doing the side quests of doing deliveries and fetch quests from other games

[0:23:55] <acedeone> ppl had to play it for a while over time
[0:23:57] <+Superbro64> You got a free hour or three to do operation 101, dontcha?
[0:23:58] <%Irridium> in a post Automata and post Astral Chain society people are finally waking up to Platinum
[0:23:58] <%DesertPenguin> @Superbro64 You're welcome. I use Dark Souls games and Battlefield 4 when I'm online just running around shooting crap. Also Gran Turismo when racing, because similar to actual driving and listening
[0:24:00] <SomersaultJustice> it's wolly time
[0:24:01] <samuraijakanddaxter> reggie IS a role model
[0:24:02] <derap41> what the hell that is an insane amount for the low number of backers
[0:24:12] <%Prevot> the game is about to come out too, so it must be done already
[0:24:17] <SaltyDongs> I want that pendant
[0:24:25] <MalformedMalice> The Wii U makes me so sad
[0:24:34] <%supersugoisenpai1> everybody went, "UNITE WALLET!" and made it happen
[0:24:35] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:24:42] <+Superbro64> @desertpenguin a good podcast game for me, is one where I dont need to pay attention to the music or sfx, so I can replace those noises with podcast noises
[0:24:42] <heroicspiritavenger> The actual porting work must be almost done, apparently it’s out in April
[0:24:50] <MyNameIsRasus> It's almost like the Wii U fucking killed that game
[0:24:52] <+Jaysky> I enjoyed the Wii U
[0:25:02] <%DesertPenguin> totally any multiplayer shooter is good for podcasts
[0:25:02] <+Superbro64> it really helps if the game repeats its track constantly, ala gran turismo, like you mentiones
[0:25:06] <+theAncopro> money divided by people = passion
[0:25:15] <%mrhandsss> regret buying the wii u. only got a handful of games and all of them went to the switch anyways
[0:25:16] <heroicspiritavenger> @mynameisrasus They also failed to advertise and explain the game
[0:25:18] <worldbrand> DansGame
[0:25:18] <%Prevot> I enjoyed almost all of Nintendo's Wii U games
[0:25:28] <%DesertPenguin> I also race in organized leagues so I'm always on for that or practicing
[0:25:35] <+Superbro64> I would hate to have a podcast replace the final boss music in a particular new game for me that I would be playing
[0:25:38] <MalformedMalice> The wii u had mad potential, wish it saw the success that the switch is getting
[0:25:43] <+Superbro64> yup yup, good stuff
[0:25:44] <+Mendin> 10% luck, 15% skill, 2200% concentrated power of will
[0:26:01] <acedeone> lol
[0:26:14] <+Superbro64> Woolie will be the first to post a no damage operation 101 run, you wait and see chat
[0:26:18] <%Prevot> Nintendo just didn't give any shits at all about this game
[0:26:19] <%mrhandsss> switch only came out so early because it wasnt successful. remember wii u was supposed to be same console gen as ps4/xbone
[0:26:21] <%Exiliator> So people times passion = money? yeah it checks out woolieSMUG
[0:26:22] <+Felto3> did i miss the death strand
[0:26:26] <+linSP> i hope the merch has no issues
[0:26:27] <%Prevot> I think Nintendo still owns it
[0:26:30] <derap41> Average kickstartes amount is 660 Dollars that is crazy high
[0:26:31] <%Exiliator> good math
[0:26:31] <+jiggy_snipe> I don't Nintendo even knows what W101 is
[0:26:37] <+agumon9000> @WoolieVersus Its in their FAQ. Nintendo owns the IP. They just didn't mind giving it too platinum for the ports
[0:26:37] <samuraijakanddaxter> woolie single handedly saved w101
[0:26:47] <%Louie_Salmon> And PC
[0:26:48] <+jiggy_snipe> and Steam
[0:26:49] <derap41> Why pays that much for a game
[0:26:53] <worldbrand> I think it speaks volumes that ninty let them port this to other consoles and also that they at no point mentioned xbox
[0:26:56] <+l33t_j4gu4r> just finished a 12 hour shift . time to go to sleep with the sweet soothing sound of woolie vs
[0:26:58] <%The_Timo> I'm about to back the w101 kickstarter for 500CAD lol @WoolieVersus
[0:27:00] <%Louie_Salmon> It coming to PC is the craziest part
[0:27:01] <MyNameIsRasus> Nintendo was like "The day W101 flopped may have been the most fateful day in your life, but for us, it was only Tuesday"
[0:27:04] <@Solidus_113> TMNT FAILED
[0:27:05] <%Irridium> well there's the TMNT game
[0:27:05] <%Exiliator> I cant believe Woolie saved it aaall on his own guys
[0:27:10] <+l33t_j4gu4r> bring back scalebound
[0:27:11] <%bread_assassin> Well......
[0:27:16] <BluBox> TMNT tho
[0:27:22] <+jiggy_snipe> Well there was that TMNT game tho
[0:27:23] <%Louie_Salmon> TMNT they didn't fail, they weren't allowed to try
[0:27:26] <peachy996> Scalebound was forced to fail
[0:27:35] <%Ecchigun> what sup?
[0:27:40] <%Ecchigun> more tech issues i can help ?
[0:27:43] <powerprotoman> just drag out the wiiu and play wonderful 101 again
[0:27:45] <derap41> What's with the skinny batman?
[0:27:46] <heroicspiritavenger> TMNT was an experiment, that just didn’t pan out
[0:27:51] <+Superbro64> Platinum ACTUALLY said in a RECENT, recent interview, that if they were allowed to work on Scalebound, they would
[0:27:53] <+l33t_j4gu4r> reggie is my role model
[0:28:04] <xXxPS9xXx> Dear Microsoft; pleeeeeeeeeeeease?
[0:28:06] <+Superbro64> Like I can find the quote, its like this week recent I think
[0:28:07] <@Solidus_113> it's a chug
[0:28:08] <%Exiliator> Platinum didnt fail Scalebound, xbox did
[0:28:08] <derap41> Think its the camera
[0:28:09] <%Irridium> a bit
[0:28:09] <+Loyks> bit chopy
[0:28:09] <DatAsuna> yes
[0:28:11] <%The_Timo> a bit yeah
[0:28:11] <Ricobana> a bnt
[0:28:15] <Ricobana> bit*
[0:28:15] <DatAsuna> not 30 either
[0:28:17] <Dingo_Eejit> only when you move
[0:28:18] <%Ecchigun> the frame rate is dependent on your capture card and the camera itself
[0:28:18] <samuraijakanddaxter> its a wee bit off
[0:28:20] <+l33t_j4gu4r> any news on the platinum kickstarter
[0:28:22] <OldManDeckardCain> I feel like a spider watching this frame rate Kappa
[0:28:24] <MalformedMalice> One of the most depressing cancellations to me will be Megaman Legends 3.
[0:28:29] <peachy996> Don't work on this game Platinum, you are not allowed
[0:28:29] <MyNameIsRasus> You're in Spiderverse FPS right now
[0:28:33] <%Louie_Salmon> Not a big deal, as long as it's not the game footage
[0:28:34] <+jiggy_snipe> it's ok human eyes can only see 30 fps Kappa
[0:28:37] <+l33t_j4gu4r> I never finished wonderful 10q :(
[0:28:40] <%Exiliator> If you sit really still, it looks fine
[0:28:44] <%Ecchigun> if your camera can only shoot on 24/30 fps like a cinematic cam, force it on 30
[0:28:50] <+linSP> its cool woolie, sometimes even i forget to turn off the porns
[0:28:53] <redrins> might as well ask max
[0:28:55] <MalformedMalice> Legends needs to make a comeback
[0:28:58] <MyNameIsRasus> Just don't move and no one will notice
[0:28:59] <derap41> I can count the wrinkles on your forehead
[0:29:00] <heroicspiritavenger> @woolieversus I think your capture card is starting to fail
[0:29:03] <%Ecchigun> the camlink is spotty
[0:29:07] <peachy996> How long ago was Scalebound trailer and Cancellation date
[0:29:08] <derap41> there are 3
[0:29:12] <+l33t_j4gu4r> as long as woolie never pulls a dsp
[0:29:17] <+l33t_j4gu4r> D:
[0:29:17] <+Superbro64> woolie must still have that Platinum 4 chrome page running Kappa
[0:29:20] <%Ecchigun> force the fps on the camlink_camera
[0:29:25] <xXxPS9xXx> Time to crowdfund a 64 core threadripper so we can get those smooth woolie frames
[0:29:27] <peachy996> Maybe they axed it so it could be released on the SeXbox
[0:29:29] <ALTRNico> !uptime
[0:29:29] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 29 minutes and 31 seconds
[0:29:30] <%Ecchigun> lower it
[0:29:41] <derap41> 24 cinematic
[0:29:49] <@Solidus_113> yeah that makes sense
[0:29:49] <ALTRNico> cinematic Kreygasm
[0:29:53] <MyNameIsRasus> 24 for Hollywoolie
[0:29:54] <DatAsuna> 60FPS is needless for the cam footage anyways
[0:30:01] <+l33t_j4gu4r> add style switching to woolie vs
[0:30:04] <derap41> woolieYE woolieYE
[0:30:04] <samuraijakanddaxter> everytime theyve talked about el gato over the years ive thought of the treasure from the rock film the rundown aka welcome to the jungle
[0:30:06] <MalformedMalice> My internet is shit so dropped frames dont matter. Yall in 144p. Still beautiful tho <3<3
[0:30:12] <+skiassassin> @WoolieVersus Hey woolie, i was just going back and watching kingdom death and was wondering when the next tablelords tabletop esque rpg will be?
[0:30:19] <+jiggy_snipe> ugh
[0:30:25] <+Superbro64> woolie can interpolate 60fps, like those anime fight scene edits on the yoo toobes Kappa
[0:30:27] <peachy996> There are not enough deaths to be a telemundo soap opera
[0:30:32] <derap41> It took way to long for me to figure out why some tv shows where looking so weird
[0:30:46] <%Prevot> shame there was no kickstarter tier to get Zubaz into 101
[0:30:49] <SomersaultJustice> should add the hoshi no kirby theme to this playlist
[0:30:52] <+l33t_j4gu4r> bienvenidos a su telenovela favarito
[0:30:56] <MyNameIsRasus> sbfpUno
[0:31:02] <+Superbro64> "finally, anime in the framerate it should ALWAYS been in to begin with" Kapoa
[0:31:04] <Futurecity10> Is WoolieVersus wearing a Arizona tea sweater
[0:31:05] <+Superbro64> Kappa
[0:31:17] <+Jaysky> Colors we-
[0:31:25] <derap41> @Futurecity10 think its a cherry blossom design
[0:31:26] <%Prevot> Woolie VS mysterious juegos
[0:31:32] <+l33t_j4gu4r> we need a telenovela anime
[0:31:48] <MyNameIsRasus> @l33t_j4gu4r it's called school days
[0:31:49] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:31:52] <heroicspiritavenger> Can we have a discussion about how it’s ridiculous how the first tier with the full OST of Wonderful 101 is a bullshit $320 tier with a vinyl and other bullshit
[0:32:08] <%Prevot> we need a telenovela adaptation of jojo
[0:32:23] <+l33t_j4gu4r> I never have had a vinyl for anything. people really go for them though
[0:32:26] <+Superbro64> dude, I just want a DIGITAL artbook, and not to spend 100+ for a physical one
[0:32:29] <+Superbro64> real talk
[0:32:43] <+skiassassin> @l33t_j4gu4r We do have rice pirate making a motion comic
[0:32:45] <acedeone> if only
[0:32:47] <MyNameIsRasus> A latino Jojo should exist (Red Sun Vendetta nonwithstanding)
[0:32:49] <+l33t_j4gu4r> jojo is like the inspiration for telenovela basically :o
[0:32:54] <+ConLin_Arts_> I want the artbook, but over 180 for that tier BibleThump
[0:32:58] <heroicspiritavenger> They need to use backerkit and let people do Add-ons to their pledges
[0:33:11] <+ConLin_Arts_> hopefully
[0:33:18] <+Superbro64> I super duper hope they offer a digital artbook option at some point
[0:33:21] <+ConLin_Arts_> like Indivisible!
[0:33:21] <+l33t_j4gu4r> bleach maybe bleach but I loved Chad being Hispanic
[0:33:26] <worldbrand> one of my acquaintances told me they got sick of this song and prefer brawl's theme and every time i think about that i like them a little less
[0:33:27] <+l33t_j4gu4r> blehh*
[0:33:27] <ghostspartan80> hopefully it doesn't end up like mighty number 9
[0:33:36] <MyNameIsRasus> MY HERO
[0:33:36] <%Solidnick18> SourPls
[0:33:40] <+Superbro64> is the full soundtrack available as a DIGITAL tier? Does anyone here know?
[0:33:50] <derap41> @heroicspiritavenger I mean the average backer has put in 600+ dollars so it seemed to work
[0:33:54] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Its Green Naruto's OST!
[0:34:09] <%Prevot> 101 is already a finished good game so it won't end up like MN9
[0:34:10] <+l33t_j4gu4r> wIt is the platinum kickstarter up?
[0:34:23] <heroicspiritavenger> @derap41 well they could have MORE money if they allowed flexibility
[0:34:24] <%mrhandsss> everyone always says "why'd they stop using you say run?" but where did THIS track go?
[0:34:25] <MyNameIsRasus> Listen to this Not Lotus Juice
[0:34:27] <+linSP> mighty number 9 was a bust as a concept and mishandling of funds
[0:34:32] <%DesertPenguin> I know this theme what is this
[0:34:48] <+l33t_j4gu4r> holy shit
[0:34:58] <+l33t_j4gu4r> talk about record breaking
[0:35:03] <+johnny_gogo> jet set tun
[0:35:03] <+Jaysky> It's from My Hero Aca
[0:35:13] <%Exiliator> @MyNameIsRasus arent Italians Latino? I thought that was were the name originated but I could be wrong woolieWUT
[0:35:24] <+johnny_gogo> jet set run*
[0:35:27] <+l33t_j4gu4r> I'm glad my next paycheck is gonna have like 120 hours on it
[0:35:31] <MalformedMalice> I have Mighty No 9 on PS Plus and still haven't played it. I remember being broke as hell and super sad that I couldnt pledge to the kickstarter. Now I can finally say for the first time in my life I was glad to be poor
[0:35:48] <+l33t_j4gu4r> dodged a bullet malice
[0:35:49] <heroicspiritavenger> @linsp it’s almost like Inafune is an ideas guy and a Bad business man or something
[0:36:14] <derap41> @heroicspiritavenger woolieWUT_TK woolieWUT_TK woolieWUT_TK woolieWUT_TK
[0:36:26] <+Superbro64> question, now pat has mentioned how long some Astral Chain chapters get, don't W101's operations get much, much longer?
[0:36:39] <+Jaysky> His idea to go from 2d to repulsive 3d was a bad idea
[0:36:51] <xXxPS9xXx> Inafune: Am I really that out of touch? No...it's the backers who are wrong
[0:36:54] <MyNameIsRasus> @Exiliator I mean, I don't if literally they count, but as far as I'm aware, most people mean latino as in latin america. Could be wrong tho
[0:36:54] <heroicspiritavenger> @jaysky Naturally
[0:37:01] <+l33t_j4gu4r> latino is more a south / central American thing.
[0:37:07] <%Exiliator> Badbusinessman sounds like a DS character
[0:37:08] <+Superbro64> Or is how dense a W101 operation usually is making it seem longer in my head?
[0:37:21] <ghostspartan80> mysterious capitalist
[0:37:28] <+Jaysky> That 2d concept was so good too
[0:37:31] <heroicspiritavenger> @exiliator or a No More Heroes villain
[0:37:38] <derap41> You think Woolie broke the camera?
[0:37:39] <+l33t_j4gu4r> Italy/ Spain are culturally more european
[0:37:43] <redrins> @MyNameIsRasus That should be the case yeah, never heard people refer to europeans who speak romance languages latinos
[0:38:02] <ghostspartan80> well italy and spain are in europe so yeah
[0:38:27] <MyNameIsRasus> I can't believe Woolie is fucking dead
[0:38:37] <+Jaysky> Shame
[0:38:42] <heroicspiritavenger> Hispanics and Latinos are interchangeable
[0:38:43] <derap41> I think Woolie broke the camera
[0:38:46] <+Superbro64> died searching for those Universal Truths
[0:38:51] <Broand> all hail master of the truth woolie

[0:41:55] <+linSP> do you think woolie is for predeterminism and would search for the plan like the priest in outer worlds does
[0:42:12] <MalformedMalice> Dancing woolie sprite makes me happy <3
[0:42:13] <StarlitStunner> The best it’s gonna get - celldweller @tucker0603
[0:42:15] <samuraijakanddaxter> when i was playing myself i tried to fragile jump back to the last region to 5 star the vert porter as i left him like 20 likes away from it, and then lo and behold i got locked in lol
[0:42:37] <heroicspiritavenger> @chesterr01 I kid, Reggie, for the record I larb ya and you’ve been an invaluable addition to the content
[0:42:37] <deviljhojho_> nah man woolie is all about the fundamental truths of the universe or something
[0:42:41] <+l33t_j4gu4r> I need to move back home to florida. at least I can handle that crazy. living in Seattle has been the worse
[0:42:48] <Cykron> We must protect our Truthers from the falsehoods spread by those of weaker minds
[0:42:50] <derap41> woolieSMUG_RA Woolie is a furry now
[0:42:59] <@chesterr01> @heroicspiritavenger 🙏🙏🙏
[0:43:00] <+l33t_j4gu4r> woolie was always a furry
[0:43:14] <heroicspiritavenger> @derap41 Woolie was always a Furry, have you not seen the images 4ch used to post
[0:43:16] <deviljhojho_> destiny is destiny
[0:43:28] <%Exiliator> Even If i ended up feeling disappointed from Outer Worlds, Id still be super up for watching Woolie play it
[0:43:30] <derap41> @heroicspiritavenger Well he's a mouse furry now
[0:43:31] <StarlitStunner> sbfpRed So it is written
[0:43:48] <+Superbro64> reminder that woolie WILL trade in the juciest of you for a sweet, sweet jetpack
[0:43:51] <MyNameIsRasus> The Woolie Hole was the real RainFurrest all along
[0:43:58] <Cykron> Well BB, I guess we really are the Death Stranding: A Kojumbo Joint
[0:44:04] <%derrickslays> derrickslays subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! I've been playing Third strike lately and I suck, but the soundtrack is fire. Gets my blood going and ready for a 10k run. keep up the content, thanks for making my week every week
[0:44:22] <SonRyzGaming956> liberal cities are shit holes dont @me
[0:44:25] <+l33t_j4gu4r> it's not even about the jetpack really, woolie just loves betrayal of the species
[0:44:26] <%Solidnick18> wooliePOYO
[0:44:39] <+l33t_j4gu4r> it's kind of awe inspiring really
[0:44:46] <derap41> Not saying I would but I'd consider it
[0:44:47] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Thanks for the LuvBlondeL @derrickslays
[0:44:58] <peachy996> I can understand Woolie's pov, I'd betray all of humanity for the things I want
[0:45:00] <heroicspiritavenger> @sonryzgaming956 At least they have modern conveniences, I live in a farming town and am trapped on DSL
[0:45:04] <peachy996> Wouldn't bat an eye
[0:45:04] <samuraijakanddaxter> oh man imagine a jetpack in this game
[0:45:11] <Cykron> @sonryzgaming956 @ing to agree
[0:45:20] <%derrickslays> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli lol what did I do tho
[0:45:42] <+l33t_j4gu4r> it's easier to betray humanity in general, than specific individuals you know and care about I bet
[0:45:45] <+Superbro64> weird how woolie would betray humanity, but at the same time, he wants universal truth for everyone to see
[0:45:48] <heroicspiritavenger> @samuraijakanddaxter BTs float and fly though lol
[0:45:49] <derap41> Pretty sure woolie would insist on the betrayal

[0:46:44] <derap41> Are we talking Rocketman jetpack or what=
[0:46:47] <+l33t_j4gu4r> he say the truth and turned all agent smith
[0:46:48] <heroicspiritavenger> @superbro64 Woolie has never claimed that he wanted humanity to have the truth for happiness or altruistic reasons
[0:47:18] <+Superbro64> what if the universal truth IS the aliens looking for a juicy meal?
[0:47:31] <Cykron> @heroicspiritavenger He did say that the naked truth would be best for humanity

[0:51:45] <%Exiliator> Now put the game in the tiny corner box LUL
[0:51:49] <%Solidnick18> hi
[0:51:49] <Dingo_Eejit> Did you set da camera to 24fps or 2.4?
[0:51:52] <%Solidnick18> no

[0:52:22] <felix_xb> its 1080 / 60
[0:52:24] <%mrhandsss> yeah do it later. not the biggest deal for game streaming
[0:52:28] <%Solidnick18> test stream PogChamp
[0:52:32] <+Gamefriendly> a different kind of Woolie will figure it out
[0:52:33] <+Maldoree> They still havent gotten past the hiccup?
[0:52:33] <+Dragoneye77> greats8Bunji greats8Bunji greats8Bunji
[0:52:47] <+l33t_j4gu4r> net test the stream
[0:52:48] <+Javaa01> Yeah, you need the whole shebang going to see the problems happen
[0:52:50] <krabsan> Sometimes its choppier but its fine honestlx
[0:52:52] <+Superbro64> he used it a bunch during the sfv launch days I think
[0:52:59] <@Solidus_113> Okay, I found the clear point to stop. @WoolieVersus It's when you get back to the first map and have the order to deliver Cryptobiotes. Stopping at this point will give you a clear path right to the end of the game next session.
[0:53:01] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:53:08] <%mrhandsss> ONWARDS
[0:53:08] <heroicspiritavenger> Your source is still outputting 1080/60 for some reason @woolieversus
[0:53:13] <Dingo_Eejit> @Maldoree - yes & no, there were audio problems local to the couch
[0:53:14] <%Exiliator> @Cykron It'll be like that one anime running currently
[0:53:21] <derap41> Cherry blossom shirt and Canada leaf pants
[0:53:24] <%wydamn> how can our stream be real if our eyes aren't real?
[0:53:37] <%ECRead> yo if my great-great-great-grandfather Deitich Valter knew I could summon a near infinite amount of information from a piece of metal and glass he'd shit his lederhosen
[0:53:39] <peachy996> Yeah that's a good stop point
[0:53:45] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> also remember to do the very last pizza mission
[0:53:49] <+linSP> thats good
[0:53:52] <%bread_assassin> That's a solid endpoint without giving a flaccid ending to the stream.
[0:53:54] <MyNameIsRasus> ACTUALLY CORRECT
[0:53:55] <+Maldoree> @Dingo_Eejit So was it located near Reggies fet?
[0:53:56] <peachy996> Yes you are not free from Pizza
[0:53:58] <Graxe_> So I guess there's an Evo thing happening tonight? Line up announcement?
[0:54:07] <Graxe_> For Evo 2020?
[0:54:07] <derap41> Pizza must be delivered
[0:54:08] <MyNameIsRasus> TODAY THERE WILL BE PIZZA
[0:54:11] <%mrhandsss> i woulda said the part before that, but if we get to see the transition from middle back to east region in this stream, im cool with it
[0:54:11] <krabsan> Oh man, can't wait for their reaction to THAT conversation
[0:54:12] <Shishi1205> last pizza mission is european extreme
[0:54:14] <samuraijakanddaxter> yh end with pizza
[0:54:14] <felix_xb> reflection tech

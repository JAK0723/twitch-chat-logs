[0:22:37] <Djinnazz> The extra Bebop gay is the coolest shit
[0:22:37] <%A_DEAD_SHOW> @cosmonautMarcus
[0:22:38] <BearSawed> Reeeeeeeeeeee
[0:22:41] <R3c0n31> EH, there are great parts in rebels but the children undertone hurts me
[0:22:41] <BallerSwagBro9k> Yes
[0:22:47] <%kekkerscrew> Rebels has like 3-4 good episodes
[0:22:48] <%FallenAngelZelos> i've tried to watch clone wars like 5 times and never got through that first, rough season
[0:22:50] <@Commando_Joe> Choo Chooo HypeYikes
[0:22:50] <Djinnazz> Shit*
[0:22:51] <+tearknack> i've just seen the 3d clone wars movie, and i've never touched the series
[0:22:52] <+Bluemanzee> So what I'm hearing is I'm glad I didn't waste my time watching any of it?
[0:22:58] <BallerSwagBro9k> not me LUL
[0:22:59] <notquitedead123> Can't tell if that's a Hawaii shirt or his grandma's curtains.

[0:23:15] <+ThePich> like ReBoot Kappa
[0:23:16] <+discouragedoblong> Narutoo
[0:23:17] <BallerSwagBro9k> Ive never seen a single episode and I never will
[0:23:17] <%oldneckbeard> hoes mad?
[0:23:19] <jorniev> the problem with rebels is that its starts just ok and it doesnt end as good, but the good parts are really good.
[0:23:21] <mistersups> Narutoo
[0:23:22] <+griffball13> Narudo is a different thing
[0:23:24] <+Daskolin> Clone Wars? More like JAR JAR Wars
[0:23:29] <vulkan_vibes> but the warfare looks dope
[0:23:38] <%Fujiwara_92> Naruto Wars monkaS
[0:23:38] <zocano> I tried to start Clone Wars after getting through Mandolorian and... I couldn't do it

[0:29:39] <HideousDeity> Rumors of Kotor 3 have literally existed for over a decade.
[0:29:46] <%DatAsuna> Kotor 3 pitches and proof of concepts were made

[0:31:30] <%DatAsuna> "racism gets half a star"
[0:31:35] <%RioGascar> RioGascar subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months, currently on a 16 month streak! So woolie you seem excited for vocal racism. But uh what about the more...harmful forms?
[0:31:35] <+jake5713> @datasuna Oh no, I know what you mean. But given the time they had to make any SW tv content between AotC and RotS, I think it was pretty solid. Plus admittedly, I'm biased for Genndy because of Samurai Jack, that and Primal.

[0:50:11] <gamewarden92> Did that include the official Mandalore buttplug?
[0:50:11] <+BlockingDisabled> I mean... it kind of makes sense. The Empire doesn't dissappear just because the Emperor (doesn't really) die.
[0:50:13] <+tearknack> fuck karen traviss
[0:50:15] <Zebroneath> Mandalore the Ultimate is the hypest design
[0:50:33] <andrei11dr> Iea ,i guess all of the Sith occupied planets would go into a financial downfall after they lost the war
[0:50:38] <%Gruhunchously> Switch him out for HK!
[0:50:42] <%DatAsuna> I prefer the cape/shoulder for Mandalore the indomitable
[0:50:52] <+Ixek> I've never used him either.
[0:50:52] <%DatAsuna> but ultimate has the cooler mask
[0:51:02] <+Zanco23> How would you know? You barely use him.
[0:51:07] <muniea3> plus you can melt droids
[0:51:10] <tranquilturnip> one of his best qualities is that he lacks feet
[0:51:24] <%Gruhunchously> They'll have to bring him to Onderon if they want enough infuence thogh
[0:51:26] <%mitchteck> Here for influence
[0:51:42] <+tearknack> @BlockingDisabled yeah, i dunno how it happened in NuPostOT, but in the EU there was a long campaign going against Imperial Intelligence, all the most loyal and greedy Moffs, surviving imp navy folks, and so on
[0:51:48] <andrei11dr> And even then you can get t3 to melt droids

[0:53:32] <yaldabaoth144> Damn, Mandos don't play around.
[0:53:35] <+Ixek> I always digged this moon.
[0:53:48] <%DatAsuna> Mandos do not have the moral high ground
[0:53:53] <%NovaKnightmare> SKYRIM BELONGS TO THE NORDS
[0:53:53] <correctedsun117> Mandalorians with Mando flags on the back of their pickup trucks
[0:53:54] <+krispen_wa> The South (Galaxy) will rise again!
[0:53:56] <gamewarden92> Are Mandalorians the Turks of Star Wars?
[0:53:57] <%DatAsuna> I love mandos, but they're assholes
[0:54:00] <Bogart4321> the compass direction will rise again
[0:54:12] <ZeeJiggle> Why did the WIRES explode like a grenade
[0:54:15] <time_axis> did he just use a forbidden word
[0:54:19] <%DatAsuna> @gamewarden92 nah that's the SIS
[0:54:20] <ardbart> I guess mandalorian is a good nickname aswell
[0:54:24] <Maleicus> always loved the siths blood line
[0:54:26] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @vulkan_vibes
[0:54:26] <ZeeJiggle> Can that happen? That's scary.
[0:54:38] <%Gruhunchously> S-word privileges
[0:54:43] <availablethor> @ZeeJiggle Mandalorian wires double as grenades. It's effective.
[0:54:46] <+jake5713> It hurts my heart to see what happens to the Mandalorians in Rebels.
[0:54:49] <%DatAsuna> Mando's are basically maori/native americans
[0:54:54] <+BubbaRands> Smrt boi sklls
[0:54:57] <Camail> we are a genius, also our buddy is a mega genius
[0:54:57] <ZeeJiggle> @availablethor Yknow what, I can believe that.
[0:55:03] <+krispen_wa> It hurts to see what happens to the Mando's in the Mandalorian
[0:55:16] <%DatAsuna> It hurts to see what happens to the mandos in clone wars
[0:55:38] <%DatAsuna> It hurts to read what happens to the mandos in Legacy
[0:55:42] <+Bluemanzee> It hurts to see what happens in Star Wars
[0:55:44] <+evbites> It hurts to see the mandos because they'll kill you
[0:55:44] <+krispen_wa> It hurts
[0:55:47] <gamewarden92> I'm suprised Bao-Dur is volunteering to help Mando's.
[0:55:49] <%DatAsuna> everything hurts
[0:55:50] <dereks0n> For a group of badasses, Mandalorians spend a lot of time getting their asses kicked
[0:55:51] <%GalacticaPhanto> it
[0:55:52] <HideousDeity> FLAMING
[0:55:55] <siamzero94> eh, stuck in old archaic ways, their doom fiths them
[0:56:10] <Camail> gamewarden92 he probably thinks he's worse than any mando, at this point
[0:56:17] <TedLives> damnit Satine!!
[0:56:36] <+krispen_wa> dammit sabine
[0:56:50] <%DatAsuna> This dog ate a sniper rifle
[0:56:58] <rubbishbinge> Damn canucks
[0:57:00] <+BubbaRands> Flaming Cannoks? Do the cannoks wear flamboyant clothing?
[0:57:01] <availablethor> How do they eat LEGENDARY SITH GEAR tho?
[0:57:35] <BallerSwagBro9k> Like Kirby
[0:57:36] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1257528186524622851
[0:57:41] <siamzero94> @availablethor Cannock don't care about your dumb space religion
[0:57:49] <%Gruhunchously> I like how all the Mandalorians have Kiwi accents because of Jango Fett
[0:57:53] <TedLives> nah duchess satine & her mando pacifism was the worst..
[0:57:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> @availablethor A collector got eaten
[0:58:16] <availablethor> @siamzero94 I find it hard to belive Exar Kun dropped his armor into one!
[0:58:42] <%DatAsuna> The quartermaster is usually one of the most respected mandos
[0:58:55] <Maleicus> exar kun was eaten by a cannok
[0:59:01] <Gruhunchously> It would be hilarious if Mandalorians were like you grandma trying to figure out Windows 10
[0:59:03] <Maleicus> simple
[0:59:04] <+krispen_wa> Exar Kun WAS a cannok
[0:59:06] <%derap41> !uptime
[0:59:07] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 59 minutes and 8 seconds
[0:59:08] <%RioGascar> thing is tho
[0:59:09] <%DatAsuna> exar kun's ghost got around a lot
[0:59:09] <R3c0n31> I mean in this universe it seems your required to know all about tech
[0:59:10] <+democrazyyy> does V Not like the clone wars or something
[0:59:14] <%RioGascar> WHAT LANGUAGE is the computers using
[0:59:15] <%DatAsuna> Luke runs into his ghost too
[0:59:16] <+Ixek> Yes
[0:59:17] <%FuqBoiSlim> so Mandalorians are just space vegans?
[0:59:18] <siamzero94> @availablethor Cannock didn't ask him
[0:59:19] <%derap41> That is such a mandalorian voice
[0:59:25] <BallerSwagBro9k> So many great VAs in this
[0:59:28] <%FuqBoiSlim> I meant bogans
[0:59:30] <+BubbaRands> All the gravely voiced VA's
[0:59:31] <%DatAsuna> @democrazyyy He likes it but rewatching it lifted off the rose tinted glasses
[0:59:42] <%RioGascar> Like is it galactic basic or does the language the computer uses change for specific planets
[0:59:46] <%masterpiecejeremy> All the Mandos sound like Clone Troopers...But the Clones weren't made from a Mando
[0:59:46] <gruulmagebeast> now i just want a chris sabat voiced mando
[0:59:48] <alexandrecau> mandalorians have the same larynx
[1:00:00] <%DatAsuna> You can like things and criticise them
[1:00:01] <SiegeJay> BUT JANGO WAS NOT A MANDO
[1:00:14] <kugarix33> ah mando do you like my baby deathstar
[1:00:15] <%JetpackMcQuack> The accent must be genetic
[1:00:15] <%masterpiecejeremy> Jango the Fake Mando
[1:00:16] <SiegeJay> I fucking hate that retcon
[1:00:20] <%DatAsuna> @SiegeJay That's the other timeline tho, he's a mando in the kotor 2 universe
[1:00:20] <availablethor> I think it has to be galactic basic because otherwise translator droids wouldn't be a thing.
[1:00:22] <+krispen_wa> In Legends wasn't Jango like THE MANDALORE
[1:00:23] <%kekkerscrew> It's true that Clone wars is a really mixed bag that has some high highs. But Rebels is mostly garbage with 3-4 good eps
[1:00:25] <%masterpiecejeremy> He was a poser
[1:00:29] <kugarix33> no
[1:00:29] <+MrAtheGreat> Jango the Mango
[1:00:33] <Halospaz117> nope
[1:00:33] <%derap41> Jango killed a mandalorian and stole his armor
[1:00:34] <+KamenOtaku> Nope. not anymore
[1:00:37] <zocano> Apparently not
[1:00:39] <+some_brave_apollo> Indian Giver George Lucas says no
[1:00:40] <Firststrike_OW> They changed it
[1:00:40] <%DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus Legends yes, canon says no
[1:00:40] <+democrazyyy> he is not anymore
[1:00:42] <%Irridium> nope
[1:00:42] <alexandrecau> Retcon has he stole it
[1:00:44] <manwithaxe> Jango was raised by a mando
[1:00:44] <%kekkerscrew> Nope Jango was never a Mando
[1:00:46] <R3c0n31> No, Stolen Armor
[1:00:46] <%NovaKnightmare> Legends yes, Canon, he was rejected by the Mandalorian governmenty
[1:00:47] <%Gruhunchously> The new canon retconned him out of being a Mandalorian
[1:00:48] <Djinnazz> No
[1:00:49] <%ChoculaUltra> wasn't he disowned?
[1:00:49] <HorribleHog> pick your own lore
[1:00:50] <SiegeJay> IT WAS RETCON
[1:00:51] <%Castle_Kundarak> He was culturally, but he's not actually from Mandalore. @WoolieVersus
[1:00:53] <%masterpiecejeremy> His armor was a Durasteel imitation
[1:00:56] <jorniev> what
[1:00:57] <memejima> Retconned out
[1:00:58] <vulkan_vibes> yes he was
[1:00:58] <siamzero94> retcon
[1:00:59] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus Jango and Bobba are NOT Mandalorians anymore, they stole the armor and REAL mandos hate them now
[1:00:59] <+KamenOtaku> During the Clone Wars
[1:00:59] <jorniev> WHAT
[1:01:00] <%DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus Also kotor 2 is legends
[1:01:01] <fist_wizard_jay> He stole the armor
[1:01:02] <%FallenAngelZelos> Star Wars Lore NotLikeThis
[1:01:08] <availablethor> it's fiction, pick your canon lol
[1:01:09] <+Bluemanzee> Disney stop NotLikeThis
[1:01:11] <manwithaxe> darth Maul was a mando, jango can be
[1:01:11] <+atin2000> oh fuck that.
[1:01:11] <%DatAsuna> So ignore canon
[1:01:11] <TedLives> clone wars retcon
[1:01:17] <+Invlux> Just like uhhh what's her name
[1:01:22] <%Gruhunchously> LUL
[1:01:24] <%ChoculaUltra> actually that kinda makes sense - cloning yourself and giving away the teachings/battle arts of the Mando would prob get you kicked out, no?
[1:01:24] <vulkan_vibes> but being a mando is cultural. you can become a mando
[1:01:25] <%masterpiecejeremy> CLone Wars retconned it BEFORE DISNEY. It's cannon
[1:01:26] <%NovaKnightmare> @Bluemanzee that wasnt Disney, Lucas did not want Jango as a mando for some reason
[1:01:27] <alexandrecau> When your side character are so hype you discredit the canon ones
[1:01:33] <spardanwarrior> So Jango Fett was a weeb. Got it
[1:01:38] <SiegeJay> Just like Mara Jane Kappa
[1:01:40] <+BubbaRands> Not native born but adopted?
[1:01:41] <%DatAsuna> @masterpiecejeremy Canon reset happened before disney bought them though
[1:01:41] <+Bluemanzee> @NovaKnightmare Star Wars stop NotLikeThis
[1:01:42] <%JetpackMcQuack> whipREE
[1:01:42] <%laserbeaming> Believe what sounds cooler, ignore canon
[1:01:45] <vulkan_vibes> huh
[1:01:46] <+tearknack> @masterpiecejeremy that requires me to give a fuck about 3d clone wars though
[1:01:47] <FMsava> YET
[1:01:48] <R3c0n31> They were Mandalorian Hunters apparently
[1:01:51] <%kekkerscrew> Jango not being a Mando wasn't a Disney thing it was a Lucas thing
[1:01:57] <%DatAsuna> So it's still seperate from legends, because the legends reset was a goerge thing, not a disney thing
[1:01:57] <%derap41> We need to let them get ready
[1:01:59] <+BubbaRands> We don't feel like fighting them LUL
[1:02:00] <alexandrecau> Our dick is so big oh shit they arwe coming
[1:02:01] <JaceDarkstar> jango is a real mandolorian so suck my dick
[1:02:08] <%Gruhunchously> The Combine says hello
[1:02:12] <%masterpiecejeremy> @DatAsuna Disney kept Clone Wars cannon. All CLone Wars retcons still count
[1:02:24] <%Slimshazbot> @WoolieVersus He hasn't played Half Life 2 yet :o
[1:02:25] <Iwashi94> Kaguya is on the moon!
[1:02:31] <%DatAsuna> Yes because disney kept the reset
[1:02:34] <+oda_flobunaga> Legends is the real canon
[1:02:35] <%RioGascar> I dont think woolie knows the 7 hour war
[1:02:37] <%DatAsuna> but the reset was pre-disney
[1:02:41] <%DatAsuna> So blame george
[1:02:44] <%ChoculaUltra> would a beskar letter opener be enough to deflect a lightsaber?
[1:02:46] <%Gruhunchously> Hmm
[1:02:48] <+tearknack> star wars canon is entirely what you want to accept as canon
[1:03:01] <%DatAsuna> He made legends non-canon because he was working on an episode 7 with or without them
[1:03:01] <+krispen_wa> That's no moon, that's a space station
[1:03:05] <bleugh> star wars starts in the last jedi
[1:03:05] <SiegeJay> @woolieversus sorry for Caps Lock, chat..
[1:03:07] <+jake5713> Know I'm imagining Gordon Freeman joining the Mandalorians.
[1:03:10] <alexandrecau> "hey there is a bunch of mandos down there" "heh who cares find the jedi"
[1:03:11] <%masterpiecejeremy> @DatAsuna George didn't write Clone Wars. And I actually like that retcon
[1:03:15] <%Gruhunchously> B E T R A Y A L
[1:03:17] <Graxe_> Betrayal
[1:03:21] <%kekkerscrew> Jango not being a Mandolorian Was Legends Canon. It was a Lucas thing that Jango fett wasn't a Mandolorian
[1:03:23] <gruulmagebeast> Betrayal at Granny on the Hill
[1:03:25] <+tearknack> if you like just the ot, the pre pt eu, the pt and pt eu, 3dcw, the new movies, sure, you do you
[1:03:28] <Redblood801> The real Star Wars canon was in your heart the whole time
[1:03:38] <+nateslogic> Yo I just got both KOTORs on steam sale on the 4th. Is there a thinng about them not running good on modern computers or something?
[1:03:46] <+sinistersally> There's a character name Cyka?
[1:03:51] <SiegeJay> @nateslogic Yes
[1:03:58] <+oda_flobunaga> The real Star Wars canon was the friends we made along the way.
[1:03:58] <+krispen_wa> you should run it in compatibility mode for windows xp
[1:04:08] <+BubbaRands> SO T H I C C
[1:04:11] <+nateslogic> ok thanks
[1:04:12] <%yeetdabsenpai69> isn't mandolorias whever wears the armor?
[1:04:13] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @nateslogic yes, but you can finangle with it
[1:04:14] <zocano> KotoR1 is... rough, but the mod makes KotoR2 run pretty fine
[1:04:29] <+tearknack> it was a 3D clone wars thing that Jango wasn't a mando, and that contradicts older EU stuff. sicne i haave consumed that older EU stuff (even if its quality is very middling), and have no interest in 3d cw, i ignore the latter
[1:04:30] <%Gruhunchously> HONOR
[1:04:34] <+oda_flobunaga> Mandelore is not a place, it is an experience

[1:05:41] <SiegeJay> The universe shouts "MYTHOSAUR!!!"
[1:05:44] <+tearknack> @krispen_wa i mean, a big ass lizard skull looking cool isn't exactly phreneology lol
[1:05:49] <%NovaKnightmare> GO-TO looks like Konami E3 2007
[1:05:58] <+logoth_> go-to-meshtar

[1:06:33] <+Invlux> Kicks PogChamp
[1:06:35] <+Ixek> Somewhere on this moon has a great spawn chance for the Grey Jedi robes. They're pretty great.
[1:06:36] <%Gruhunchously> Top Kex
[1:06:37] <%GeneralSCPatton> The idea that they don't care about any kind of honorable burial rite is weird.
[1:06:42] <Doodle_Taco> Kekz

[1:06:49] <JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> keks
[1:06:51] <BallerSwagBro9k> KEK
[1:06:52] <Daxalog> Kek or Cringe.
[1:06:53] <MasterKoosh> KEXW
[1:06:54] <%DatAsuna> They do, just not for jobbers
[1:06:56] <%ChoculaUltra> you know Kex just stands around looking at dank memes on his phone all day.
[1:06:58] <+oda_flobunaga> Last name Kex, first name PePe
[1:06:58] <+sinistersally> Mother aprove
[1:07:01] <+MidnightBurst12> don't trust them new jedi over there
[1:07:03] <alexandrecau> mandalore quartermaster, you're a bitch
[1:07:05] <%Irridium> get some of that Keks Mix
[1:07:11] <SiegeJay> Kek
[1:07:17] <%DatAsuna> Giving you a good burial is for your family to worry about unless you're a cool guy
[1:07:19] <alrobot2014> @GeneralSCPatton is it an honorable death to be killed by cannocks?
[1:07:23] <+Ixek> Oof.
[1:07:28] <+RJay80> retroKEKW
[1:07:29] <Graxe_> Unstoppable damage type
[1:07:30] <zocano> Mandalorian Disintegrator is
[1:07:34] <zocano> but ripper is close
[1:07:38] <+krispen_wa> double Mando Rippers with Force Speed and full dex is the greatest thing ever
[1:07:38] <Fathuran> @generalscpatton klingons ain't much different in that regard
[1:07:40] <BallerSwagBro9k> PogChamp
[1:07:45] <gruulmagebeast> Rip and Tear
[1:07:49] <%ChoculaUltra> wait what - "belonged to JIGGER wraith"
[1:07:50] <SiegeJay> FULLY UPGRADEABLE PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[1:07:50] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Pog
[1:07:51] <%DatAsuna> I think cando's heavy repeater is better but, sure best pistol
[1:07:52] <%Chatterbox1991> rip Robin Sachs btw
[1:07:54] <+SolidusRex> Second gun
[1:07:56] <%Sparkseid> Until it is done
[1:08:03] <+SolidusRex> Second best IO mean
[1:08:24] <alrobot2014> oops all jedi
[1:08:25] <%hzflank> Disintigrator cannot be found on vendors afaik, but it is far better than Ripper
[1:08:34] <tranquilturnip> can't make an RPG without heavy armor
[1:08:35] <%DatAsuna> Or if you just don't care about force powers
[1:08:42] <%DatAsuna> it does look good
[1:08:44] <gruulmagebeast> how does heavy armor hold back space magic!
[1:08:51] <%DatAsuna> It's just missing the cowl
[1:09:05] <%hoenhime344> fuck.... no dokapon?
[1:09:06] <%DatAsuna> It also comes in silver
[1:09:09] <asurite_warrior> A jedi is most powerful when he's nude
[1:09:13] <+Ixek> I recall liking the Heavy Armor.
[1:09:17] <+krispen_wa> wait
[1:09:18] <candidateplays> Nope
[1:09:19] <asurite_warrior> FULLY IN TOUCH WITH THE FORXW
[1:09:19] <%hoenhime344> oh...tomorrow. damnit
[1:09:20] <SiegeJay> Heavy Armor stops space magic because THE WILLS
[1:09:24] <+krispen_wa> doesn't that party member only use one armor
[1:09:24] <+OmegaGangstaMode> Do you really want 5-6 party members relying on force powers?
[1:09:32] <%Ashenik1> who?
[1:09:34] <+tearknack> @gruulmagebeast kotor 1 and 2 are based off of dnd 3.x, so wizards cant wear armor
[1:09:44] <JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> men only want one thing: FULLY UPGRADEABLE
[1:09:47] <+tearknack> its a "balance" thing
[1:09:51] <+krispen_wa> that party member literally can't change their armor
[1:09:54] <zocano> ya the last character is good either melee or dual wielding pistols (technically they're better melee but that's lame)
[1:09:56] <%Gruhunchously> Fully upgradable
[1:10:02] <+tearknack> has no basis in star wars lore at all
[1:10:13] <%ChoculaUltra> my biggest fear is that a KOTOR remake would legit go full 5E on us for "streamlining" purposes.
[1:10:16] <MasterKoosh> @tearknack well, tbf, they still could, but spell fail chance isn't a thing, so simpler to just restrict it here
[1:10:17] <SiegeJay> You just want to FULLY UPGRADEABLE 2B
[1:10:20] <zocano> Mandalorian Disintegrator is what you want to find but Rippers are great
[1:10:30] <samafine> ohh yea this game is fucking tight
[1:10:35] <+Zyquux> Honestly, just throw Handmaiden in heavy armor. it's not like she'll be using Force powers.
[1:10:42] <%DatAsuna> ^
[1:10:53] <asurite_warrior> What was the big hiatus on this game?
[1:11:03] <alrobot2014> V was ill
[1:11:07] <%ChoculaUltra> @asurite_warrior V Mills was Ill Mills
[1:11:09] <%Gruhunchously> V was sick
[1:11:12] <%DatAsuna> @asurite_warrior v had to self isolate with some flu-like symptoms
[1:11:21] <kugarix33> have you ever heard of darth reva... oh wait he's not cannon never mi... wait he's cannon again
[1:11:26] <DaBigVitus> happy the guys healthy. but dokapon tho...
[1:11:29] <SiegeJay> The second best reason to have a robot waifu is she is FULLY UPGRADEABLE
[1:11:37] <asurite_warrior> ohh happy to see he's still alive then
[1:11:40] <%laserbeaming> 18-20 becomes 15-20 with Keen IIRC
[1:11:41] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream

[1:11:50] <%a_goth_pancake> more like NO-TO
[1:11:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> It's not inconceivable that heavy armor would be uncomfortable and distracting. Since the Force runs on concentration and feelings, that could reasonably interfere.
[1:12:02] <%ChoculaUltra> we all know at the end of Dokapon, V MIlls will be there at the funeral service delivering 3 eulogies LUL
[1:12:11] <Aydarkzero> it's to late!

[1:12:45] <knyttstories> calebKek Keks
[1:12:45] <+tearknack> @ChoculaUltra i wouldn't mind it tbh, cause kotor doesn't actually have that many options tbh. you can't pick your race, there's 8 skills and 1 is PC only, and theres 6 classes (with 3 prestige classes) and they have extremely minimal differences
[1:12:54] <atema128> YOOOO welcome back Little V!
[1:13:05] <%derap41> They respect that
[1:13:06] <+oda_flobunaga> of the Man Who sold the Race War?
[1:13:08] <DaBigVitus> i haven't been watching this LP. i hear it's more like V is playing but woolie is on the controls if that makes sense. is that the case?
[1:13:12] <asurite_warrior> Oh V have you gotten your N pass from woolie
[1:13:13] <+oda_flobunaga> or*
[1:13:13] <R3c0n31> That would actually be worth it to be fair when near endgame
[1:13:24] <SiegeJay> A lot of N words in this chat and subreddit
[1:13:26] <+tearknack> @ChoculaUltra and most of the feats are incredibly lame, just little +1/+2/+3 to whatevers
[1:13:56] <+bear_breaker20> I didnt even realize this was Little V without the full beard lol
[1:14:01] <%ChoculaUltra> @tearknack you're onto something. I'd love to see more expansion on the prestige classes.

[1:26:01] <VJdarkworld> "Force"
[1:26:04] <Psyramics> Davrel's from Space Austrailia
[1:26:04] <JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> everything based on dahvrel
[1:26:07] <alexandrecau> and no items
[1:26:08] <%yeetdabsenpai69> "FORCE"
[1:26:08] <Daxalog> Oh my god I just realized. GOTO is piloting a droid. GOTO like. Go To like programming commands Go To. OH MY GOD
[1:26:21] <%gunsrlove> Military cultures throughout history are not that entirely about HONOUR as the mandos or other, those are always over-emphasized qualities
[1:26:22] <%DatAsuna> The main thing about mandos is they're a loose affiliation of disparate tribes that aren't centralized. Then clone wars kinda shits on it.
[1:26:31] <$QueequegTheater> Mandalorian Scrub Quotes
[1:26:31] <%JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[1:26:34] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @Daxalog they aren't there yet
[1:26:35] <Idon__> You're never NOT using the force
[1:26:35] <VJdarkworld> NO WHILLS
[1:26:37] <%Ashenik1> Spartans werent that great of a warriors but were good at propaganda. Macedonian phalanx though !!!!
[1:26:41] <%DatAsuna> Clone Wars mandos is like saying "Well if we never colonised america there'd still be a USA"
[1:26:42] <Lefteron> Some do extra pussups other learn to use the force
[1:26:44] <R3c0n31> I mean they obviously have prisons that contain force wielders
[1:26:44] <Heyestus> *miss*
[1:26:44] <vulkan_vibes> Force wallop
[1:26:48] <trianglehat> wouldn't force powers be what they really want to practice against?
[1:26:50] <correctedsun117> And Mandalorians train in martial skills all the time, yet call you weak for a skill you use, at best, half the time
[1:26:52] <GoldeNOVA> The Force is just Sharingan forever
[1:26:54] <%ekodrop> V's alive
[1:26:55] <siamzero94> oh boy kelborn is gonna be a bitch
[1:26:57] <LeafarOz> hax
[1:27:00] <MooseoneLivedhere> Romans any day
[1:27:00] <mistersups> Did that mother fucker do a backflip?
[1:27:04] <vulkan_vibes> woof.
[1:27:06] <yukin0tora> Uh oh
[1:27:12] <%Irridium> take the L
[1:27:15] <%NovaKnightmare> gotta take the L honorably
[1:27:15] <%GeneralSCPatton> Force Masters should have all the passive bonuses. +Wis Bonus to EVERYTHING!
[1:27:15] <Jammho> i save levels for this bullshit
[1:27:19] <%kyh9> Well, it's more about martial competence vs your ability to do damage
[1:27:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> Somebodies getting fucked...
[1:27:21] <%ChoculaUltra> Tagren said get fuck out of pools, scrub.
[1:27:22] <Idon__> "Y-you just got lucky!"
[1:27:23] <%kyh9> Tai Jutsu, only
[1:27:25] <%laserbeaming> buff before the fight?
[1:27:31] <vulkan_vibes> yeah this will suck. consider swapping gear to juice defense
[1:27:32] <Idon__> OUCH
[1:27:32] <lotharrio> Swap out your gear.
[1:27:34] <+RJay80> doodOuch Honor Loss -
[1:27:34] <%kyh9> "If I could use my god-powers, you'd be fucked"
[1:27:35] <Zantetzuken> humbled
[1:27:35] <%NovaKnightmare> OOF
[1:27:39] <%Gruhunchously> Damn
[1:27:40] <%yeetdabsenpai69> get fucked Woolie
[1:27:41] <%BisoromiBear> CLEAR and HONORABLE
[1:27:41] <Doodle_Taco> OOF
[1:27:43] <vulkan_vibes> swap gear to neglect force
[1:27:48] <alexandrecau> Wow fuck you kex
[1:27:49] <Jaku2011> Free
[1:27:50] <%DatAsuna> RIP those guys
[1:28:01] <GoldeNOVA> NIGHT PAK, LET'S GO
[1:28:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie thought he was hot shit and thought he could coast this fight.
[1:28:18] <Psyramics> Can they tell if you use Force buffs?
[1:28:25] <lotharrio> Woolie has punch gauntlets doesn't he?
[1:28:25] <Psyramics> How would they even know?
[1:28:25] <+mrcooperblack> How to cheat.....honorably!
[1:28:27] <+eanscrale> buh honor doh
[1:28:29] <Safarihat> the buffs stay during the fight iirc
[1:28:36] <mistersups> When Dokapon ends who will be the CLEAR and HONARABLE victor?
[1:28:38] <Daxalog> You were doing pretty good just using your basic attack
[1:28:46] <+tearknack> in kotor 1 and 2 i gnerally found flurry to be better, tbh?
[1:28:55] <megamirk> if you use autofire, he'll know
[1:29:00] <%kekkerscrew> There is a difference between opening yourself up to the will of the force and letting it guide your actions. That's someone everyone can do. They just don't want you picking them up with telekenisis and other bullshit.
[1:29:04] <Safarihat> pop buffs before you talk to the sergant and they stay
[1:29:09] <Halospaz117> Ultra Instinct Mando
[1:29:10] <siamzero94> better gear should help
[1:29:12] <Lamedhos> Change equipments
[1:29:12] <Doodle_Taco> He has Trickster on
[1:29:15] <megamirk> flurry is something I always spected into, as well
[1:29:26] <+tearknack> multiple attacks means you get multiple chances to hit,
[1:29:36] <Idon__> "Y-yo, bo5, come on."
[1:29:38] <%jinking79> so much for Raw lvl 3
[1:29:40] <zocano> ya this fight was the closest I had of the 4, I used flurries cause I was a double-sider for my recent playthrough
[1:29:48] <alrobot2014> different saber forms?
[1:29:50] <Wheresmypassword> I've been waiting a long time for this, good to see this is back!
[1:29:50] <%laserbeaming> Keep in mind you are using a 3/4ths BAB class + a 1/2 BAB class
[1:29:55] <$QueequegTheater> Fann "Perfect Legend" Y'Pak
[1:29:56] <%ChoculaUltra> For Mandalore!
[1:29:58] <%Gruhunchously> FOR MANDALORE
[1:29:59] <Pistachius> i popped stimulants before the fight lol
[1:30:00] <%DatAsuna> mid fight level also is an exploit
[1:30:00] <%sammyisa> HeyGuys HeyGuys HeyGuys
[1:30:04] <JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> no chill ALL HONOR
[1:30:06] <%gunsrlove> OOGH
[1:30:07] <lotharrio> Check your gear, Woolie.
[1:30:11] <Psyramics> change your gear to spec into CQC
[1:30:21] <%Gruhunchously> You can change your gear for different results
[1:30:23] <Redblood801> Can we get a For Mandalore emote?
[1:30:25] <%GeneralSCPatton> @jonwholovesflatwomen ONE YEAR, NO DISHONOR
[1:30:25] <Safarihat> @WoolieVersus you can stim before that fight
[1:30:33] <supuhmagikarp> CHANGE YOUR STANCE usedAAAA
[1:30:33] <+beardedjho> Put bullets into the gun
[1:30:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> I am so happy that even with as broken as Woolie is, the Mandalorians are still bad-ass
[1:30:43] <%Ashenik1> Mandalorians in For Honour PogChamp
[1:30:47] <Heyestus> +bludgeoning resistance armor upgrades can help you cheese Tagren
[1:30:54] <Pistachius> Dex helps with hand to hand?
[1:30:56] <megamirk> Is Woolie broken? I think he's more of a magic character now
[1:30:56] <%laserbeaming> Oh yeah, he had gear with physical resistance right?
[1:31:04] <+Zyquux> I forget, does the mine exploit work in the Mandalorian ring?
[1:31:15] <%DatAsuna> It should year
[1:31:24] <%Gruhunchously> @Zyquux They patched it out in the RCM
[1:31:44] <zocano> I didn't need to reload for the Tagryn fight but I probably just got lucky, I was specc'd half DEX half Int
[1:31:48] <zocano> so I wasn't all in on melee
[1:31:54] <%FallenAngelZelos> Keeeeeeeeen
[1:31:59] <Safarihat> you can pop stims then talk to the sergant iirc
[1:32:13] <Pistachius> yup, that was my strat lol
[1:32:18] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> This isn't the same without the guys yelling FOR MANDALORE in the background, can we go back to them?
[1:32:53] <%xcompleasedad> Shit. What's happened?

[1:33:19] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 33 minutes
[1:33:32] <lotharrio> Oh and the Ripper has a better version called the Mandalorian Disintegrator. Its base damage is about twice as high as the Ripper.
[1:33:57] <%Gruhunchously> Smart boi

[1:34:06] <zocano> Oh god right this is only their 2nd planet
[1:34:09] <zocano> They are early
[1:34:15] <zocano> I always go to Onderon late
[1:34:21] <%Gruhunchously> Give him demolitions as a class skill
[1:34:28] <+tearknack> i kind of want to play kotor 2 again right now, but i';ve played it like, a dozen times or so and i'd proably get bored halfway through tbh
[1:34:32] <megamirk> T3 romance when
[1:34:54] <%laserbeaming> Expert 20. The True Skill Monkey
[1:34:54] <%GeneralSCPatton> T3 GOODEST BOI
[1:34:58] <lotharrio> Light Stonks.
[1:34:59] <+Bluemanzee> T3 is the real protag
[1:35:13] <plushysceptile> So how'd you like that peek at a playable Shiva, Woolie?
[1:35:13] <%PsideFxX> Galaxy Brain
[1:35:14] <%GeneralSCPatton> @laserbeaming YOU MEAN FACTOTUM 20
[1:35:18] <zocano> I did a darkside playthrough most recently and seeing actual Darth T3 is amusing
[1:35:38] <%Gruhunchously> T3 chilling in the red embers is great
[1:36:01] <+tearknack> @GeneralSCPatton i never saw anyone do anything more than dip factotum, i cannot recall any of its higher elvel abilties at all
[1:36:15] <+tearknack> i msotly jsut rememebr it being a shittier verison of the chameleon PRC
[1:36:41] <+netrac> + severe almighty damage
[1:36:43] <%Gruhunchously> Give it to HK
[1:36:47] <Zebroneath> Plus DUAL WIELDING
[1:36:48] <lotharrio> 1/4 chance to crit.
[1:37:05] <+tearknack> any 19-20 weapon with keen is 15-20
[1:37:10] <%laserbeaming> all 18-20 guns go to 15-20 with keen
[1:37:14] <+tearknack> thats how keen/improved crit in 3.x works
[1:37:16] <%FallenAngelZelos> More where that came from indeed
[1:37:19] <%PsideFxX> T3
[1:37:22] <+tearknack> 18-20, not 19-20
[1:37:25] <sendart> Atton ranged Jedi
[1:37:26] <%xcompleasedad> HK is fucking dancing in the corner
[1:37:28] <R3c0n31> Can HK even Duel Wield?
[1:37:29] <%GeneralSCPatton> @tearknack It synergises really well in Gestalt or similar. Had a party member use it to great effect in Tristalt with Ghaele Eladrin and Walker in the Waste.
[1:37:30] <+SolidusRex> Imagine how they'll react when they get a Mandalorian Disintigrator
[1:37:32] <+Invlux> I wonder who that'll be Kappa
[1:37:36] <%Gruhunchously> @R3c0n31 Yes he can
[1:37:48] <%laserbeaming> 19-20 goes to 17-20 I think
[1:37:52] <+tearknack> @GeneralSCPatton fucking TRISTALT
[1:37:55] <+tearknack> that sounds
[1:37:58] <+tearknack> incredibly dumb
[1:37:58] <ysayu147> I've never played this before what is happening?
[1:37:59] <R3c0n31> @Gruhunchously Broken Gross
[1:38:01] <megamirk> Master, I believe I am experiencing what meatbags refer to as "love"
[1:38:03] <zocano> If you go full damage instead of crit you can get stupid numbers too
[1:38:07] <%Reverend_Roscoe> FUCK
[1:38:09] <%Reverend_Roscoe> ONLY SECOND?
[1:38:10] <+oda_flobunaga> HK is Secreting Coolant in the corner
[1:38:11] <zocano> like 40-60 a shot
[1:38:16] <+SolidusRex> Second best pistol
[1:38:27] <lotharrio> Second best pistol in the game. Mandalorian Disintegrator has higher base damage.
[1:38:27] <%Gruhunchously> You're breaking this poor game
[1:38:34] <zocano> I never found any Mandalorian Disintegrators
[1:38:39] <zocano> In my recent playtrhough ):
[1:38:43] <%Gruhunchously> Bring HK the good boi
[1:39:00] <%DatAsuna> words
[1:39:01] <%Ashenik1> Should HK explain how to kill somebody on this planet?
[1:39:13] <+tearknack> yeah i wasn't the biggest fan of how rng based loot is in my recent (ish) kotor 2 playthrough
[1:39:17] <lotharrio> Gotta be high level and hit the right spots at the right time, @zocano . Fassa will have one if you do her quest line and finish it by... level 26.
[1:39:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> So, unrelated, but I just dropped my Switch and the ONLY reason the screen didn't completely shatter is because I had a screen protector on. I don't think I've been more terrified in months.
[1:39:34] <%Gruhunchously> Damn
[1:39:36] <zocano> @lotharrio Even with that
[1:39:40] <lotharrio> Damn
[1:39:40] <zocano> She didn't have any
[1:39:43] <resloxxx> what
[1:39:44] <%ChoculaUltra> @CommanderSqueaks holy shit, I clenched reading that
[1:39:44] <BallerSwagBro9k> ROBOLOCAUST
[1:39:45] <%Gruhunchously> Detroit: Become Human
[1:39:51] <TheFranss> BEEP BOOP
[1:39:52] <zocano> I know I can reroll the vendors but it wasn't necessary
[1:39:56] <+tearknack> @Gruhunchously LUL
[1:39:57] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:39:59] <%GeneralSCPatton> @tearknack That Tristalt campaign was the best most satisfying thing ever. The DM got to throw some broken BULLSHIT at us.
[1:40:00] <%Gruhunchously> HK is gleefully slaughtering androids
[1:40:02] <zocano> it's for like 10% more broken
[1:40:03] <%xcompleasedad> GET TE FUCKING SCRAPPER OnLINE
[1:40:04] <GoldeNOVA> Toaster Roaster
[1:40:06] <alextrebeken> a gun that shoots lightsabers
[1:40:11] <%Gruhunchously> Massah
[1:40:16] <%PsideFxX> We Boopin
[1:40:19] <%DatAsuna> Yes
[1:40:21] <zocano> plus I used a rifle on HK instead even though it's technically worse to do
[1:40:23] <DSD24> HK is 50 percent in love
[1:40:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> @choculaultra There is a little chips at the very edges where the protector ends, but it landed FACE DOWN on the corner of my dish drying rack.
[1:40:25] <%DatAsuna> Just ask Zaeed from mass effect
[1:40:26] <+oda_flobunaga> All that coolant HK is secreting is causing him to rust
[1:40:29] <arkv01> you keep that shit in your resting quarters HK, no oil gushing in public
[1:40:31] <Jolnir> woolieS
[1:40:38] <%xcompleasedad> Have they done G0T0's stuff yet?
[1:40:41] <+tearknack> yeah by numbers its better to dual wield with basically everyone
[1:40:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> After I bumbled with it and caused it to do a double flip
[1:40:53] <%ChoculaUltra> @CommanderSqueaks cot damn, thank the sith it turned out fine
[1:40:57] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @xcompleasedad no
[1:41:00] <lotharrio> @xcompleasedad A small amount of it. Basically no planet-side stuff.
[1:41:06] <siamzero94> bastila uses it
[1:41:10] <+evbites> a gun power by a kyper crystal is just the death star now if only they made them on a smaller scale
[1:41:10] <%xcompleasedad> @Reverend_Roscoe Excellent @lotharrio
[1:41:11] <zocano> dual wielding guns is I think always better
[1:41:22] <zocano> unfortunately
[1:41:28] <zocano> cause I think rifles are cooler
[1:41:39] <ZeeJiggle> I mean we're playing the sequel, spoilers should be- yea
[1:41:42] <%laserbeaming> No, you always kill Bastila
[1:41:44] <+tearknack> but you don't really need to make everyone dual wield, cause as V has said you end up super broken at the end of this game
[1:41:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> @choculaultra I think wish Switch came with that same wristband the wii-motes did
[1:41:48] <%derap41> We come to watch you guys not Kotor
[1:41:50] <+evbites> Yeah all need to see the climb of pockets
[1:41:51] <zocano> ya
[1:41:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> fuck, words
[1:41:54] <lotharrio> Dual pistols is better 95% of the time. I think one or two of the feats are technically better with rifles in KotOR 2. Maybe.
[1:41:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> You know what I meant
[1:41:56] <%DatAsuna> I played 2 before 1 back in the day lol
[1:41:58] <zocano> it just makes a certain thing with HK harder
[1:42:07] <zocano> unless you get lucky and get that sweet 75% dmg reduction armor
[1:42:08] <+Estuko> I like rifles just for the sake of looking profesional lol
[1:42:13] <Jaku2011> I can't believe you spoiled the game that this game actively spoils!
[1:42:16] <Matermind0> Yeah I played 2 before 1
[1:42:17] <%ChoculaUltra> @CommanderSqueaks that would actually be super smart. I think there's a few 3rd party wrist straps out there already
[1:42:37] <+Zanco23> @Matermind0 Same
[1:42:37] <%Gruhunchously> "Balanced"
[1:42:39] <+oda_flobunaga> I couldn't bring myself to finish 1
[1:42:53] <zocano> If you get lucky and find that quantum armor for HK he's basically undying
[1:42:57] <%DatAsuna> kotor 2 and new vegas are miracles for how short their dev cycles were
[1:43:00] <zocano> 75% energy dmg reduction is stupid
[1:43:06] <%laserbeaming> 1 is not as good
[1:43:13] <+oda_flobunaga> That Obsidian touch
[1:43:22] <%Reverend_Roscoe> Bao-Netta
[1:43:28] <+evbites> i like how normal guns are vital for killing jedi since jedi cant deflect them and they explode
[1:43:32] <megamirk> you're now picturing half naked Bao-dur with leg guns
[1:43:33] <+tearknack> @DatAsuna i repalyed vanilla vanilla NV last summer, and, it was a bit trying, but it pretty fun still
[1:43:37] <GoldeNOVA> 2 is better in every way
[1:43:42] <%laserbeaming> I finished 1 twice. But every time I got to Water Planet I wanted to quit.
[1:43:46] <megamirk> 1 is more polished
[1:43:46] <Jaku2011> Obsidians newer stuff isn't much better than ok tho
[1:43:50] <+Zanco23> I didn't understand who Revan was, and why you could pick different options regarding what he did.
[1:43:52] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @megamirk jokes on you, I was ALREADY thinking that
[1:43:53] <lotharrio> Soldiers get more feats, too.
[1:44:00] <+BlackfyreRoy> Oh hey the person sitting next to Woolie on the couch is giving him information that isn't wrong. That's new. Oh it isn't Pat.
[1:44:01] <zocano> New Vegas is good, I think I was expecting a bit more coming off of KotoR2 when I played it recently (last year) but New Vegas is still great despite my expectations
[1:44:11] <%CommanderSqueaks> @evbites So, do they go THROUGH lightsabers or do they just explode when they hit the saber so the shrapnel gets them anyway?
[1:44:18] <zocano> Honestly once you get Force Storm, that's all you need for the rest of the game
[1:44:20] <megamirk> @Reverend_Roscoe NotLikeThis
[1:44:21] <zocano> it's kinda broken dumb
[1:44:26] <lotharrio> These repairs were very HONORABLE.
[1:44:29] <Mr__Jebus> You are only min-maxing not Mihn-maxing
[1:44:31] <siamzero94> how nice
[1:44:39] <+evbites> depends on whether or not the bullet has explosives in it
[1:44:44] <TheFranss> Wait... Is this guy really that confident HE doesn't need to fix shit anymore?
[1:44:45] <megamirk> I want an entire game about the mandalorians in this camp
[1:44:53] <megamirk> it would work
[1:44:54] <+oda_flobunaga> Polish is one thing, quality of writing is another, it depends on what you personally value more... its all subjective
[1:44:58] <+Invlux> He has half health LUL
[1:45:01] <yukin0tora> mad
[1:45:07] <zocano> Ya it's a shame this spot is so short
[1:45:11] <Graxe_> Just put him in an Izanami loop
[1:45:20] <kugarix33> they lost super hard
[1:45:21] <+evbites> normal bullets would melt
[1:45:27] <alexandrecau> They didn't lose it was a draw
[1:45:31] <%Reverend_Roscoe> you would have all been murdered
[1:45:31] <+tearknack> @zocano NV is great, but its not like Kotor in that its not considered the best written thing in its franchise and super revolutionary for a bunch of people
[1:45:35] <alexandrecau> they had sun in their eyes
[1:45:38] <megamirk> people underestimate Mandalorians, Revan was just too OP
[1:45:40] <BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[1:45:42] <TheFranss> YEYEYE
[1:45:42] <Scrub_Seeker> HOES MAD
[1:45:46] <chronoxgp> yer on
[1:45:51] <DSD24> muffled hoes mad in the distance...
[1:45:52] <%DatAsuna> They can take jedi in battle sometimes but it's still a 9:10 matchup in favor of jedi
[1:45:59] <lotharrio> No! What if you get copyright claimed by that singer/songwriter/sith?
[1:46:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh so you just suck
[1:46:06] <megamirk> "sometimes" lol, keep watching this
[1:46:08] <GoldeNOVA> Revan fucked up the Mandalorians like Guy fucked up Madara
[1:46:20] <zocano> @tearknack Ya, New Vegas is great as a "true" successor to Fallout 1 and 2 and letting you play a multi-path RPG
[1:46:24] <%derap41> YOU DIDN'T WIN!
[1:46:28] <+oda_flobunaga> Kind of interesting how there is this ever repeating conflict between Sith and Jedi that just keeps happening generation after generation. Where are the reincarnating chosen ones at?
[1:46:31] <+Invlux> That's why you're a quartermaster bitch
[1:46:33] <%TubeMan642> TubeMan642 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! Finally back to KOTOR and out with NUNS love watching everything you guys do. Keep it up punch Dad.
[1:46:38] <+tearknack> yeah there was a lot more mandos than jedi, and thats how they were a threat in the war
[1:46:38] <chronoxgp> I got this on the OG xbox like 3 months ago with dino crisis 3 and SVC
[1:46:40] <zocano> KotoR2 is great because of how it approaches Star Wars and chooses to make a specific star wars story in that vein
[1:46:42] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @WoolieVersus Star Wars Scrubquotes
[1:46:43] <SiegeJay> @goldenova You mean none
[1:46:51] <%ChoculaUltra> didn't Revan take the Mandalore the Great mask and throw their entire way of life into limbo for the duration he had it?
[1:46:55] <%GeneralSCPatton> NO JOHNS
[1:46:56] <Maleicus> good advice
[1:47:02] <%masterpiecejeremy> Mandos will die before ending up of scrubquotes
[1:47:02] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[1:47:12] <+tearknack> there are some suepr badass mandos, but generally, your average jedi can take your average mando, even multiple average mandos, although it isn't super easy
[1:47:23] <zocano> @ChoculaUltra It's explained later
[1:47:29] <+oda_flobunaga> Jedi Uzumaki, Sith Uchiha
[1:47:32] <%Gruhunchously> Bring HK into the Jungle. BRING HK for the Influence!
[1:47:35] <%ChoculaUltra> @zocano ah kk. ty!
[1:47:45] <+Ixek> Yeah, bring HK for the influence in the Jungle.
[1:47:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> @tearknack Which is why you'd think that the Mandos would be SPECIFICALLY training on how to counter Jedi right now.
[1:47:55] <alexandrecau> Even regular army can take mandos by number and prep they just attack hard place no one really wants to defend
[1:48:05] <chronoxgp> are the mandos clones of the guy who saved yoda???
[1:48:11] <%DatAsuna> nno
[1:48:12] <%ChoculaUltra> like a dragon dragon or like a krayt dragon...dragon

[1:49:08] <+tearknack> @CommanderSqueaks not much point from the mano pov, considering the jedi have seemingly killed themselves off
[1:49:09] <Mr__Jebus> ah, he's one of those
[1:49:10] <+jake5713> So dismissive!
[1:49:10] <%Gruhunchously> Do have the slightest idea how little that norrows it down?
[1:49:22] <+Zanco23> Nerd
[1:49:25] <+oda_flobunaga> The new Sith have implanted themselves with Nomi Sunrider cells, for more force power.
[1:49:25] <siamzero94> he's a fucking dumbass, no mandalorian is faulting him for losing to a jedi
[1:49:26] <+evbites> then you don't deserve that honer
[1:49:29] <wowowinsane> denied the pleasure of battle because of boomer mandalorians
[1:49:30] <alexandrecau> But who are you though
[1:49:31] <+HollowMan190> welll timed lighting
[1:49:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> @tearknack Which, at this point, Mandalore should go "Oh fuck they're not dead, okay CHANGE OF PLAN GUYS."

[1:51:35] <%JetpackMcQuack> Kill him
[1:51:36] <%powerprotoman> give him the run back and then dont sue weapons
[1:51:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> He's young and dumb, give him some slack
[1:51:46] <+jake5713> It's more lightside to respect his culture. So not killing him is darkside and super disrespectful.

[2:14:01] <%oldneckbeard> hoes mad?
[2:14:19] <%DatAsuna> Not really
[2:14:20] <%cylish> Have you heard the legends of Darth V the Subversive?
[2:14:22] <%DatAsuna> It's a subplot
[2:14:27] <dereks0n> *her
[2:14:28] <%DatAsuna> the main plot is about you and the council
[2:14:44] <%laserbeaming> The one that actually knows is T3, but he's not talking
[2:14:52] <candidateplays> plenty of neutral points, though
[2:14:53] <lotharrio> Hey there it is!
[2:15:03] <+AsinPersuasion> you can get hk to negative 100 influence pretty easy isn't it?
[2:15:10] <zocano> You can go negative/low infleunce but it's really hard for HK iirc
[2:15:10] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:15:18] <Doodle_Taco> Hey chat, did I miss something important?
[2:15:28] <%yeetdabsenpai69> if they hate you enough they talk to you too i heard
[2:15:31] <Heyestus> Mira ResidentSleeper
[2:15:31] <ZeeJiggle> HK go up. @Doodle_Taco
[2:15:32] <lotharrio> @Doodle_Taco Woolie blew a guy up so HK would smile.
[2:15:34] <muniea3> yup exactly yup
[2:15:34] <Ghostbody> @doodle_taco HK influence moment
[2:15:36] <%Gruhunchously> There's a second influence gain for HK in the Kelborn conversation
[2:15:36] <BallerSwagBro9k> @Doodle_Taco Only the funniest bit yet
[2:15:39] <+dragonzord12> yeah but there are neutral points
[2:15:40] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @Doodle_Taco yes...
[2:15:40] <+AsinPersuasion> @yeetdabsenpai69 yes its true
[2:15:42] <%Irridium> just stretching the idea of light later to the maximum strain
[2:15:46] <evilaltruistic> @doodle_taco Woolie mercilessly murdered an innocent guy
[2:15:55] <+AsinPersuasion> all the conversation markers are at an absolute value
[2:15:56] <+doc_ock_rokc> Kando would press the button himself
[2:16:00] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @evilaltruistic no it was little V
[2:16:00] <+Exicuren> Cando would approve
[2:16:03] <Doodle_Taco> Damn that sounds sick, sad I missed it
[2:16:07] <+AsinPersuasion> so you can trigger it by going either +25 or -25 influence
[2:16:08] <%ChoculaUltra> Cando would've revoked Kumus' M-card.
[2:16:12] <%caffienatedjedi> Obviously the most blue boy
[2:16:13] <zocano> Most of HK's + influence are from straight murder
[2:16:17] <+doc_ock_rokc> Cando the Mando would press the button
[2:16:29] <+Zanco23> Canderous is full dark side for sure
[2:16:30] <evilaltruistic> @yeetdabsenpai69 Did it? where's the evidence? I dont see any evidence
[2:16:31] <+Invlux> Bloods Cando
[2:16:31] <+AsinPersuasion> like if you do the mod to let you choose between hanharr and mira
[2:16:33] <OldManDeckardCain> cando would say the n-word LUL
[2:16:42] <evilaltruistic> Woolie is a coldhearted killer
[2:16:43] <+Exicuren> Cando would say "Do it already"
[2:16:48] <+AsinPersuasion> you can max out hanharr with negative influence while being light side pretty easily
[2:16:49] <zocano> Eeeh, Cando here is way more mellow
[2:16:53] <alexandrecau> kreia approves
[2:16:54] <+doc_ock_rokc> @OldManDeckardCain would you say anything to him?
[2:16:58] <TheFranss> Also the greater good
[2:16:59] <+AsinPersuasion> takes like 2 non conversation triggers
[2:16:59] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @evilaltruistic the video?
[2:17:12] <OldManDeckardCain> @doc_ock_rokc his gun is a n pass plus plus
[2:17:18] <megamirk> I like the cut of this guy's jib
[2:17:22] <lotharrio> You beat him unarmed and you're specced into magic, Woolie.
[2:17:27] <Redblood801> Hood plan
[2:17:27] <+AsinPersuasion> so they still aren't reading chat whatsoever right?
[2:17:33] <%DatAsuna> just model rigging
[2:17:34] <BallerSwagBro9k> yes
[2:17:36] <+doc_ock_rokc> @OldManDeckardCain the old grandfathered N Pass unlimited
[2:17:41] <lotharrio> Not really reading.

[2:23:01] <megamirk> Padawan -> Jedi -> Jedi Knight -> Jedi Master
[2:23:06] <megamirk> seems pretty self explanatory
[2:23:09] <evilaltruistic> Curious what kind of lore an assassin robot would have.
[2:23:14] <startstoprepeat> dark jedi night robes, dark jedi evening robes
[2:23:17] <SheefEatsBeef> what do you mean "you people?"

[2:32:24] <%gutlesscoward> confirmed cooler arm than wife arm
[2:32:33] <%laserbeaming> It's fortitude for Stasis? I thought it was like Hold Person
[2:32:33] <DSD24> @Invlux That's a horrible ability
[2:32:40] <%Jetzord> @gruhunchously which part?
[2:32:49] <muniea3> HK for here?
[2:32:50] <%Reverend_Roscoe> DUMPTY DUMB
[2:32:53] <+oda_flobunaga> I don't either, I'm just pointing out the stupid bs that has been added to canon over the years
[2:32:55] <%subjectg> yeah, fortitude for stasis and will for lightning
[2:32:56] <lotharrio> Cando just so happy that you opened up his garage for him.
[2:33:06] <%Gruhunchously> @Jetzord Where Shepard kicks one of those dog things in the face
[2:33:07] <zocano> this room
[2:33:09] <zocano> is a loot hoard
[2:33:12] <yukin0tora> This room
[2:33:17] <DSD24> How deadly are these mines
[2:33:26] <megamirk> you have force lightning
[2:33:26] <%GeneralSCPatton> @tearknack The fact that both sides have such critical flaws that they can never fix. Jedi being hyper passive about some evils and oppressive to the point of being a sith factory. And the sith being so self-destructively backstabbing. Seems like a form of mindfuck from an invisible Cthulu bullshit.
[2:33:47] <+Zanco23> Death Troopers
[2:33:54] <%DatAsuna> I hate death troopers xD
[2:33:59] <%Gruhunchously> Clone Wars has a few episodes
[2:34:01] <%Irridium> like the hyperspace ghosts
[2:34:05] <+Estuko> FeelsBadMan I liked Death Troopers lol
[2:34:07] <wowowinsane> peragus is a little horror
[2:34:07] <%DatAsuna> But there is horror books yes
[2:34:08] <%subjectg> shadow stormtroopers were cooler
[2:34:11] <%GrassCannon> There's that one level in Republic Commando
[2:34:15] <+Ixek> Look at that big lad.
[2:34:18] <+Invlux> @GeneralSCPatton Like, the force makes them that way so one never has the upper hand? That would be funny
[2:34:18] <Scrub_Seeker> Republic Commando has the ghost ship
[2:34:18] <zocano> Korriban is absolutely getting close to horror
[2:34:19] <Dangerzone979> I liked the rakghoul plague stuff in the GCW
[2:34:21] <+Estuko> @GrassCannon the ghost ship that was fun!
[2:34:21] <+evbites> reguler people uncovering a crazed sith lord
[2:34:23] <+Ixek> The absolute size of him
[2:34:24] <%breakdancinghobo> I own that book about Zombie Storm Troopers
[2:34:25] <megamirk> @GrassCannon yes, but then it's just bug people
[2:34:28] <%caffienatedjedi> Man, there was that kids book that had the monks who put their brains in spider droids.
[2:34:30] <+tearknack> @GeneralSCPatton i think looking at bad, repetitive writing and going "it must be "cthulhu mindfuck" is silly
[2:34:31] <+killerkonnat> The unknown alien race in the Thrawn books is kinda horrifying when you find out more
[2:34:46] <+atin2000> Have they read death troopers?
[2:34:46] <+oda_flobunaga> EXar Kuns disembodied spirit on yavin 4
[2:34:48] <%laserbeaming> They don't?
[2:34:50] <gastherobots> @GeneralSCPatton Thing is, the Jedi's failings are just from their own teachings and way of thinking while the failings of the Sith are literally because of the way they use the force they fucks them up and destroys their minds.
[2:34:55] <%yeetdabsenpai69> your characther does rigth?
[2:34:55] <lotharrio> Kreia doesn't say it?
[2:34:56] <$Jazzarms> a boy so hungry he ate his own name

[2:35:47] <jorniev> wow
[2:35:48] <+oda_flobunaga> Exar Kun's survival is legit horrifying in the legends continuity
[2:35:50] <%Gruhunchously> They based his design off of No-Face from Spirited Away

[2:36:10] <%laserbeaming> Darth Nihilus is cool
[2:36:15] <+tearknack> @GeneralSCPatton which is part of the problem imo with people who get super upset because of the stuipd prophecy in the PT

[2:36:48] <jorniev> WHAAAA
[2:36:49] <KnightofNights2> HE IS THE EMBODIMENT OF THE N-WORD
[2:36:51] <%xcompleasedad> THAT'S WHY THE THUMBNAIL IS SO GOOD

[2:37:08] <DXLelouch24> Nihilus is Future Woolie merged with the Woolie hole
[2:37:11] <Doodle_Taco> No one says the N word
[2:37:13] <+tearknack> @oda_flobunaga there's been stupid stuff before and after that. part of being a sW fan, from before the PT up till now, has always been picking and choosing what stuff you want to accept as your own canon
[2:37:16] <%TheFabledAble> Hey guys! So glad to see yall are back playin this game. Im glad to see yall doin well, hope you have a great time diving into the game cause Im gonna have fun watchin and listenin ^_^ cheers! Cheer500
[2:37:16] <%perfectsalami> An N word you cant say
[2:37:21] <%laserbeaming> oh yeah, I found the statue, he DOES have dreads
[2:37:21] <%caffienatedjedi> @tearknack Turns out it was called Galaxy of Fear. JIt was like Star Wars Goose Bumps
[2:37:26] <+doc_ock_rokc> Nihilus is the source of the N pass he hungers for those who use it too much
[2:37:29] <megamirk> SWOTOR NotLikeThis
[2:37:30] <+croxeye> whatsup with Liberty Prime here
[2:37:33] <%DatAsuna> Agreed

[2:37:51] <+oda_flobunaga> I get that, In my head Disney canon does not exist.
[2:37:53] <+evbites> he's what randos think vader is
[2:37:55] <+Estuko> I love the artwork of Nihilus, so ominous and just exiting as evil
[2:37:59] <%Irridium> Nihilus literally a black void with a mask shit's sick

[2:38:44] <+doc_ock_rokc> Such a shame westworld never got 2 more seasons
[2:38:59] <phatmac16> Good thing Westworld ended strong with just one season.
[2:39:25] <%Gruhunchously> The one season of Westworld was pretty good
[2:39:31] <+doc_ock_rokc> And didn't petter out with some bad afterlife alagory and another season that just meanders around
[2:39:44] <lotharrio> It's weird that season 2 of Westworld was just a music video for Green Day's "Time of Your Life.
[2:39:46] <+oda_flobunaga> It was so depressing when BSG ended when they got to Earth and it was an irradiated wasteland
[2:39:50] <DSD24> Basically Season 1 of Westworld is good but don't watch the others?
[2:39:52] <BallerSwagBro9k> BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZT
[2:39:53] <+AsinPersuasion> and i'm sure as hell glad that i aaron paul never joined the westworld cast
[2:40:01] <+jake5713> Westworld is dope. I think Season 4 is going full Mad Max x Terminator. Machine vs man.
[2:40:11] <ThePimpGuin> same experience?
[2:40:16] <%ChoculaUltra> Let me write down “only watch season 1” next to westworld on my watch list lmao

[2:48:10] <+Zanco23> @gade177 Yeah, why?
[2:48:13] <gade177> I like how both of them just ignore that fact.
[2:48:16] <BallerSwagBro9k> WHO?
[2:48:20] <zocano> don't forget the qel-droma belt
[2:48:20] <DSD24> I like the other mask way more
[2:48:34] <%laserbeaming> Before Peter Quill was relevant
[2:48:41] <gade177> Like they know it happened but they're just like yeah no.
[2:48:54] <%DatAsuna> @Zathas agreed htey're generally the 2 least popular clases however I love the act 2/3 of consular because ti zooms out to do more world building
[2:48:57] <+Zanco23> @gade177 Probably best not to bring it up. :D
[2:49:04] <gade177> Yeah lol
[2:49:06] <%Pillagius> Woolie isn't Star Lord... He's man that'll become known as Star Lord! woolieGASM
[2:49:12] <%DatAsuna> And because Nadia is more of an actual padawan you take in and train
[2:49:24] <%DatAsuna> Kira is practically a knight already by the time you get her.
[2:49:25] <+oda_flobunaga> THe jedi formerly known as star lord
[2:49:27] <gade177> I remember when she told Han and the look on his face was priceless.
[2:49:30] <%laserbeaming> So... Does this game do the 1.5 times STR when two-handing thing?
[2:49:43] <Goodvibes99508> woolieF Cum on
[2:49:50] <Jakev91489> No power attacks in this
[2:49:51] <+oda_flobunaga> Two handing is not a thing
[2:49:53] <%Ashenik1> Would you guys be for Dave Filoni be in charge of the Star Wars Universe? Like new movies shows etc
[2:49:58] <%Gruhunchously> Immunity to crits is REALLY good
[2:50:04] <+tearknack> @laserbeaming no
[2:50:04] <+oda_flobunaga> dual weilding on the other hand...
[2:50:18] <%DatAsuna> No, I dislike how hard filoni pushes his shitty waifu
[2:50:21] <+doc_ock_rokc> @Ashenik1 I would give reference to the devil over KK
[2:50:23] <BallerSwagBro9k> EXAR CLONES?
[2:50:30] <DSD24> Exar Kun's 50 sets of light armor
[2:50:31] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:50:35] <%DatAsuna> Ahsoka is gonna walk out of a time portal into the high republic
[2:50:37] <megamirk> yep
[2:50:39] <+Zanco23> @Ashenik1 Sure, seems to know what he's doing most of the time.
[2:50:42] <%GeneralSCPatton> I grab my staff and wizard hat
[2:50:44] <DSD24> I though Ahsoka died
[2:50:46] <gade177> so thoughts on The Last Of Us 2 leaks?
[2:50:47] <%Gruhunchously> I wonder if it's just an off-brand collector's item
[2:50:47] <%subjectg> there is actually a 1.5x str mod buff when using a single sword
[2:50:47] <DSD24> thought
[2:50:48] <time_axis> hunter2
[2:50:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> Do people still use IRC?
[2:50:50] <megamirk> bash is pretty old
[2:50:53] <lotharrio> Is that where the wizard hat came from?
[2:50:56] <%laserbeaming> use Bash, it's so much better than Powershell or Batch Files
[2:50:58] <%Ashenik1> @DatAsuna why hate Ahsoka :<
[2:50:59] <%GrassCannon> "I broke my g-string fingering a minor"
[2:51:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> @laserbeaming AMEN
[2:51:07] <+NWannabe> bash confuses me.....coding is scary
[2:51:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> @laserbeaming It's why I'm so glad I don't need to work with Windows servers, Powershell SUCKS
[2:51:27] <%DatAsuna> @DSD24 ep9 had her as a voice with the ghosts but then filoni tok to twitter to go "NUH-UH SHE NEVER DIED, AHSOKA 4EVA, LOOK FORWARD TO MANDO S2 AKA THE AHSOKA SHOW"
[2:51:29] <+Zanco23> @DSD24 We just know she died sometime before Episode 9, but we have yet to see her death.
[2:51:37] <+netrac> Powershell is so much better than bash
[2:51:40] <+NWannabe> agree on ps sucking tho
[2:51:40] <%afronooch> Thats fucking ancient
[2:51:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> That mask
[2:51:44] <%laserbeaming> @CommanderSqueaks it DOES! I've had to done stuff with it. It's hell.
[2:51:45] <+SolidusRex> "What should I give my sister for unzipping?" "Ten bucks?" "I mean Winzip."
[2:51:45] <DSD24> @DatAsuna @Zanco23 Thank you to your both
[2:51:53] <Skullyton175> DarkMode
[2:51:56] <+netrac> and I use bash a lot
[2:52:00] <%laserbeaming> @CommanderSqueaks not to mention that Windows Server is terrible overall
[2:52:01] <%DatAsuna> Ahsoka is the lightning returns claire farron of star wars
[2:52:01] <+tearknack> what?
[2:52:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> @laserbeaming To be fair, I'm using python and Ansible for most things now, regardless of the OS.
[2:52:11] <DSD24> Mask's are cool
[2:52:12] <dereks0n> Mandalorians are definitely dark
[2:52:13] <%GeneralSCPatton> Light-siders have no need to cover their face
[2:52:13] <+evbites> plo coon
[2:52:13] <+tearknack> i mean, soldier were helmets
[2:52:14] <+croxeye> "we got to see the heroes faces thooooo"
[2:52:14] <%DatAsuna> Temple guardians wore masks
[2:52:14] <Psyramics> there is one dude
[2:52:17] <time_axis> there's those aliens with the mouth masks
[2:52:19] <%DatAsuna> Masks are just jobber
[2:52:20] <zocano> good people show their face cause ego
[2:52:22] <siamzero94> revan was in the beginning of the mando war
[2:52:23] <jorniev> only in rebels
[2:52:23] <vulkan_vibes> duros maak
[2:52:26] <megamirk> is Ahsoka dead in lore
[2:52:28] <Mr__Jebus> my boi Plo Koon
[2:52:29] <+tearknack> uh, whose that one jedi from the PT
[2:52:32] <asylumkon> revan donned the mask as a jedi
[2:52:34] <Augus7717> PLO KOON
[2:52:36] <+tearknack> who has an air breathing mask
[2:52:38] <BallerSwagBro9k> That one Tusken Raider Jedi
[2:52:40] <Toastyrific> what about the temple guards?
[2:52:41] <+tearknack> plo koon, yeah
[2:52:42] <gade177> I like this games take on Jedi's. Basically they're all dicks.
[2:52:43] <DSD24> What about Kit Fisto?
[2:52:45] <Zathas> SWtOR's biggest problem is how front heavy the act are. Act 1, if you include the starter and capitol planet (which you should) has a total of 6 planets you go through. Act 2/3 only have 3. And Act 2 is including Quesh, which was really only a single zone instead of a planet.
[2:52:47] <%Ashenik1> Ahsoka is alive
[2:52:48] <+Zanco23> @megamirk Probably
[2:52:55] <megamirk> aww, she was hot
[2:52:56] <Goodvibes99508> temple guards
[2:52:58] <+oda_flobunaga> Ploo Koon wears a mask
[2:53:05] <Mr__Jebus> Darth Krayt's dad
[2:53:06] <BallerSwagBro9k> @DSD24 That cant be a real name...
[2:53:12] <%DatAsuna> I wouldn' call that the biggest swtor problem
[2:53:14] <%DatAsuna> but it is one
[2:53:16] <candidateplays> yeah plo koon needs a mask to breathe
[2:53:17] <vulkan_vibes> plo was a dope species
[2:53:17] <+SolidusRex> Plo Koon is a bro
[2:53:17] <DSD24> @BallerSwagBro9k I am dead serious
[2:53:18] <Iwashi94> doesn't plo koon need the mask to live though?
[2:53:19] <jorniev> KANAN from rebels has a mask too
[2:53:20] <%GrassCannon> Do Kel'dor count?
[2:53:21] <Redblood801> Plo's Bros Rise Up
[2:53:23] <+evbites> v you don't know plo koon
[2:53:24] <jorniev> yeaaaaaaaa
[2:53:31] <megamirk> NotLikeThis
[2:53:32] <%DatAsuna> X - doubt
[2:53:32] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @BallerSwagBro9k it's the squid jedi
[2:53:34] <ZeeJiggle> "Light side"
[2:53:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> "LIght Side"
[2:53:35] <FMsava> kap
[2:53:35] <%subjectg> Friendly reminder that master baytes exists
[2:53:36] <%Gruhunchously> Has Star Wars ever done an orgy?
[2:53:37] <+Ancopro> mmmm
[2:53:38] <+Ixek> Revan began wearing his mask when he was still a Jedi, though it was at the same time he decided to fight against the Mandalorians.
[2:53:40] <Klefth> ...Yes. You...
[2:53:41] <Mr__Jebus> ah ah ah Light Side Later
[2:53:43] <alextrebeken> what about that "youre not disposible to me" guy
[2:53:44] <+jake5713> Trailblazer!
[2:53:46] <DSD24> Tobin is a god name
[2:53:47] <vulkan_vibes> plus species needed those masks to live in atmosphere
[2:53:47] <jorniev> solving problems together
[2:53:48] <SekishinFist> Kanan from Rebels had one for a minute
[2:53:49] <+plowman35> PLO KOON
[2:53:50] <phatmac16> COVID?
[2:53:50] <DSD24> good
[2:53:52] <Jaku2011> V saying that will not stop the tweets
[2:53:54] <%DatAsuna> @Ixek Also his mask is literally a mando mask
[2:53:54] <BallerSwagBro9k> @DSD24 Theres no way they didnt know
[2:53:54] <%laserbeaming> @Gruhunchously I mean, probably
[2:54:01] <megamirk> Onderon is too close to Alderan and it confuses me
[2:54:03] <T_Sasquatch> Kanan gets REKT LUL
[2:54:05] <Lefteron> Plo Koon:I am a well known jedi master Little Vi:Not to me
[2:54:06] <Jolnir> woolieGLORY
[2:54:12] <maznuts> !uptime
[2:54:13] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 54 minutes
[2:54:14] <Dangerzone979> @alextrebeken Yeah that's Plo-Koon
[2:54:28] <%DatAsuna> Vaklu is the guy that sicked the cops on you when you arrived
[2:54:31] <Mr__Jebus> Also every Jedi Temple Guard wear's a mask
[2:54:32] <+evbites> @Gruhunchously jabba's definitely also that rouge one hentie monster
[2:54:32] <%GrassCannon> Who's queen Talia NotLikeThis
[2:54:35] <+doc_ock_rokc> you made a dangerous enemy....for non mandos
[2:54:37] <+Ixek> @DatAsuna Ye, belonged to a Mando who tried to stop a pointless slaughter and was cut down for their trouble.
[2:54:41] <alextrebeken> @Dangerzone979 ah thanks, didnt know his name
[2:54:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> Camera calm down
[2:55:02] <DSD24> You gotta change your mask too
[2:55:26] <%Gruhunchously> Aw C'mon
[2:55:28] <%laserbeaming> you can put on those new gloves
[2:55:30] <+Ancopro> EZ mode
[2:55:32] <siamzero94> what cowards
[2:55:42] <Klefth> So be a bitch, you say
[2:55:43] <Jaku2011> You have unlocked easy mode
[2:55:47] <%Gruhunchously> JUST USE THE UNARMED GLOVES YOU PICKED UP
[2:55:52] <%Ashenik1> Should he have HK all the time on this planet?
[2:55:53] <gastherobots> You someone is badass when a Mandalorian is like "Yeah he fought us super good" and they're just a normal dude.
[2:55:58] <%DatAsuna> @Zathas also I would say the main reason the pub stories are weaker than imp is cause you bsically skip being a padawan to go directly to adventuring and become a knight by coruscant having taken 0 lessons.
[2:55:58] <+Invlux> I'm da giant Cannok dat makes all of da rules
[2:55:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> The fuck
[2:55:58] <+Zanco23> @siamzero94 That's why they're playing light side.
[2:56:00] <AceArann> No honor
[2:56:00] <jorniev> its all a bunch of tricks
[2:56:03] <Mr__Jebus> yoooooo
[2:56:20] <megamirk> double bladed is baller
[2:56:24] <megamirk> go for double bladed
[2:56:31] <%caffienatedjedi> Triple Bladed Lightsaber when
[2:56:35] <DSD24> Thats the joke
[2:56:41] <%DatAsuna> I always give visas double
[2:56:42] <+oda_flobunaga> V-Sauce
[2:56:42] <+thatotherblackkid> where is the joke?
[2:56:45] <JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> too bad there's no honor in killing these things because they carry LIGHTSABERS
[2:56:46] <%subjectg> we have dueling already, seems like a waste
[2:56:46] <%derap41> ...I don't get it
[2:56:50] <Doodle_Taco> Oh reddit
[2:56:53] <megamirk> short is for yoda
[2:56:54] <%afronooch> LULl
[2:56:58] <%DatAsuna> Shotos are cool
[2:57:02] <+oda_flobunaga> lil V-Sauce
[2:57:07] <DSD24> What's wrong with being balanced
[2:57:08] <%DatAsuna> Shotos are for the katana and wakizashi vibe
[2:57:11] <+Bluemanzee> I gave short to granny since she's granny
[2:57:13] <+AsinPersuasion> what is woolie even saying
[2:57:17] <siamzero94> woolie doesn't get the difference between a katana and a wakizashi
[2:57:18] <zocano> nah I give Visas single so she's just straight caster
[2:57:19] <%DatAsuna> They existed before maul remember
[2:57:19] <+AsinPersuasion> he got one
[2:57:22] <ch3ggy> shotos are for the ahsoka vibe
[2:57:23] <%derap41> Two Doubles
[2:57:29] <+AsinPersuasion> so is he saying he wants a single bladed
[2:57:29] <+Estuko> I LOVE using them in Jedi Academy, the ability to kick a bastard across the room is hilarious and useful in duels
[2:57:33] <+AsinPersuasion> to use dual wield
[2:57:35] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[2:57:38] <%laserbeaming> Short Lightsabers are good.
[2:57:40] <+tearknack> short is a light weapon, so its -0 to hit when you have greater twf, instead of -2
[2:57:43] <ch3ggy> also only using it in Jedi Fallen Order
[2:57:47] <+oda_flobunaga> Asaji Ventress had the best of both worlds
[2:57:51] <lotharrio> Double bladed is good for your Jedi allies, since you don't need to spread out as many upgrade materials.
[2:57:58] <Aydarkzero> All i need is ONE
[2:58:00] <%DatAsuna> I stay double
[2:58:00] <+evbites> i can't wait for more cross guard sabres
[2:58:04] <%Pillagius> Double-bladed lightsaber that can switch to just two singular lightsabers!
[2:58:06] <gruulmagebeast> short 10/10
[2:58:09] <siamzero94> oh my god
[2:58:13] <%derap41> But two doubles tho
[2:58:13] <%Gruhunchously> Short
[2:58:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> Shortstack lightsaber
[2:58:15] <%Ashenik1> If there ever was dual fighting historicaly, it was with one short and one long.
[2:58:17] <DSD24> Luke Skywalker had a short lightsaber
[2:58:18] <%DatAsuna> wow
[2:58:20] <+jepupu> Lightknife?
[2:58:23] <Dangerzone979> This is why Grevious is so cool, the only thing better than dual wielding is quad-wielding
[2:58:23] <%DatAsuna> Two men have never been so wrong
[2:58:28] <%GeneralSCPatton> @lotharrio But dual wielding increases how many upgrades you can cram onto each person.
[2:58:29] <+oda_flobunaga> Shorts are sooo useful though
[2:58:29] <+tearknack> @DatAsuna yeah iirc Exar Kun in TotJ is the first person to ever have one, which is, i dunno, 95 or so?
[2:58:34] <@Commando_Joe> swang
[2:58:41] <+Bluemanzee> Shorts are definitely for dual wielders
[2:58:42] <@Commando_Joe> swang his light saber
[2:58:43] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @WoolieVersus you should definitely play fallen order
[2:58:52] <Heyestus> yoda-size for her pleasure
[2:58:57] <megamirk> then Kylo Ren's shit is just stupid
[2:58:58] <+dragonzord12> I like the one in fallen order a double double lightsaber
[2:59:03] <Jakev91489> If anyone isn't aware, KOTOR 1 & 2 are on sale for like 3 bucks on steam
[2:59:03] <+kawachipto> fallen order has the best lightsaber ever
[2:59:08] <+democrazyyy> yeah you should definitely do Jedi fallen order
[2:59:09] <GoldeNOVA> Savage also uses his as a Zweihander
[2:59:15] <%GeneralSCPatton> @dangerzone979 Have you seen the edited clip where he draws a couple dozen lightsabers and then vaporizes himself when he goes to spin them?
[2:59:17] <+oda_flobunaga> EXAR KUN invented the double bladed lightsaber
[2:59:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh so THAT's why they didn't have him talk.
[2:59:20] <DSD24> I dislike how its all singles in the new movies
[2:59:21] <+evbites> ahh double sided aka the death blender
[2:59:21] <%Gruhunchously> Just take the L and go
[2:59:23] <%cylish> V, Show him the opening movies for SWTOR
[2:59:27] <ZeeJiggle> YEE
[2:59:27] <%Ashenik1> Yeah I think Maul is the best dualist alive but is too arogant
[2:59:27] <Dangerzone979> @megamirk Ren's lightsaber is the only good thing he had going for him
[2:59:33] <%Irridium> uh oh
[2:59:34] <+prime_name> CRASH BABY
[2:59:35] <%xcompleasedad> 4
[2:59:38] <siamzero94> the game hates your decisions
[2:59:39] <+Estuko> I want to recommend Jedi Academy but I feel like it might be a bit messy still since last person I had play got too frustrated lol
[2:59:40] <Dangerzone979> @GeneralSCPatton Oh yeah, it's great
[2:59:40] <%DatAsuna> @cylish I've already made arrangements for that, it'll be later way later
[2:59:41] <gruulmagebeast> can we agree that the helicopter blades from rebels are really lame
[2:59:42] <Graxe_> Think
[2:59:42] <+prime_name> aaaww
[2:59:43] <Mr__Jebus> Shout out to Ray Park
[2:59:44] <lotharrio> @GeneralSCPatton Yeah but the really strong crystals are rarer, so, outside of stat boosting crystals, it's generally better to have a double blade since it's the same number of attacks as dual wield, but your unique +20 damage setup gets applied to all your attacks.
[2:59:47] <megamirk> @Dangerzone979 I get the concept but it's over designed for me
[2:59:54] <Jaku2011> Just take the double
[2:59:55] <%Pillagius> getting close to 100
[2:59:55] <%xcompleasedad> TOO MUCH SCUMMING
[2:59:58] <ch3ggy> So what are they trying to get from the drop?
[2:59:58] <Jaku2011> Coward
[3:00:06] <%Irridium> just a normal single lightsaber
[3:00:07] <GoldeNOVA> I like Savage's fighting style, super violent
[3:00:07] <+AsinPersuasion> just a regular old lightsaber
[3:00:12] <DSD24> He also kicks hard
[3:00:13] <%Gruhunchously> Single Lightsaber
[3:00:14] <ch3ggy> ahh ok, thanks
[3:00:20] <%cylish> @DatAsuna Fuck yeah!
[3:00:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> "Wait you can DO that?" - Soon Dead Jedi
[3:00:33] <megamirk> Qui Gon could've trained more instead of being all weird and shit
[3:00:38] <%DatAsuna> But yeah please don't ask woolie to skip ahead he'l get there when he gets there
[3:00:41] <+doc_ock_rokc> I love Obiwan vs Maul on tatooine
[3:00:50] <+evbites> also maul is a fuckin beast and he'll fuck up anyone preferably on even footing
[3:01:01] <ch3ggy> yess the dual suns episode was great
[3:01:04] <Iwashi94> Dark Souls kinda does that tbf
[3:01:05] <Redblood801> Fentress has 2 that become one
[3:01:05] <+AsinPersuasion> thats why i was confused what the fuck woolie was saying
[3:01:09] <ch3ggy> idc what people say it was cool
[3:01:12] <Redblood801> Ventress
[3:01:12] <GoldeNOVA> Maul is not great to this day
[3:01:17] <Lefteron> most jedi of the prequel era didn't train to fight other force users in general
[3:01:20] <+Estuko> LUL
[3:01:20] <%Ashenik1> @doc_ock_rokc It had perfect length !
[3:01:27] <%cylish> @DatAsuna was more thinking about the cool ass duel bladed saber fights, but I get you
[3:01:28] <%DatAsuna> oof
[3:01:34] <Klefth> Oh no
[3:01:36] <megamirk> Mace Windu had the highest melee stat but got reck'd
[3:01:37] <@Commando_Joe> He was also Toad in X-Men @WoolieVersus
[3:01:46] <+oda_flobunaga> As is tradition
[3:01:56] <StarlitStunner> Sam Wittwer is great
[3:01:57] <+democrazyyy> Sam witwer is the best mail voice
[3:02:01] <Robot_Nixon_> FeelsBadMan
[3:02:02] <+democrazyyy> Maul*
[3:02:03] <Mr__Jebus> Sam Witwer is perfect for maul now tho
[3:02:05] <%Gruhunchously> Wasn't it Peter Serafinowicz?
[3:02:06] <+oda_flobunaga> Escape from New York
[3:02:06] <%derap41> Tell him to scream for a bit so h gets husly
[3:02:08] <Jaku2011> Hercules in new york
[3:02:10] <gruulmagebeast> anyone know where to find that ray park clip they just mentioned?
[3:02:11] <ch3ggy> he really is
[3:02:24] <gade177> If everyone didn't talk in the prequels. That would make it slightly better.
[3:02:25] <+SolidusRex> Get to the good shit already Woolie
[3:02:35] <%Ashenik1> Sam Witwer
[3:02:40] <Aydarkzero> Sam is AWESOME

[3:02:41] <Halospaz117> He's AMAZING at it
[3:02:43] <GoldeNOVA> Woolie is gonna finish KOTOR II before TCW
[3:02:43] <%DatAsuna> He also plays palpatine
[3:02:44] <Heyestus> That happened in HERCULES
[3:02:48] <StarlitStunner> Sam Witwer streams on twitch
[3:02:49] <zocano> ya that guy fucking loves star wars
[3:02:56] <Mr__Jebus> He was in Solo

[3:03:02] <+AsinPersuasion> @Heyestus disAPPOINTED
[3:03:03] <Halospaz117> He also does an awesome Palpatine
[3:03:05] <%DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus he also voices palpatine, guy is a vocal chameleon
[3:03:06] <+jake5713> Sat Witwer, hot as hell.
[3:03:18] <Skullyton175> Squid1 Kappa Squid4
[3:03:19] <Halospaz117> Like, he voiced Palpatine in Force Unleashed, I know that
[3:03:21] <+Estuko> @derap41 I know this one person who works at costco as a wireless Salesman and his voice is kinda fucked but he's popular with the kids for sounding like a villain lol
[3:03:33] <Chisas_Dead_Body> Sam witwer is also pulpy
[3:03:36] <+jjjkopf> The Space Australians
[3:03:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> So do these fucks have no stomach acid or anything? How is everything in great condition when you get it from their gut?
[3:03:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> Neutral

[3:04:18] <%GeneralSCPatton> @commandersqueaks Fancy space metals
[3:04:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> Twerka industries gets you more.
[3:04:20] <%a_goth_pancake> ray park totally did the choreography for maul in the last episodes of clone wars.
[3:04:24] <%Malik1002> BUT V THESE POCKETS AINT FULL
[3:04:25] <+Bluemanzee> Customer service jedi

[3:04:58] <ch3ggy> what's this 'horrible shit't they speak of?
[3:04:58] <+democrazyyy> that's what I love, Sam Witwer is the voice of Maul, Ray Park is the body
[3:05:07] <CursedNobleman> the thing is, most of these rpgs have piss ant rewards that arent worth anything anyhow. now if you turned down the excalibur +1 for lightside points, that would be nuts
[3:05:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie doesn't understand how turning down a reward is a good action.
[3:05:15] <%Gruhunchously> Scout Master
[3:05:15] <%laserbeaming> It was my Pwasure uwu
[3:05:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> This says a lot
[3:05:19] <Graxe_> Light Now so Light Later
[3:05:30] <%DatAsuna> The ultimate in shitty quest rewards is horizon zero dawn
[3:05:37] <gade177> It's not a good action it's a stupid action.
[3:05:38] <%laserbeaming> You get a huge boost
[3:05:39] <+jjjkopf> and con I think
[3:06:00] <%Gruhunchously> Put the big punch gloves on
[3:06:03] <hellkhat> i love these star wars streams
[3:06:04] <+tearknack> i mean you are a MURDERER AND A SLAVE OWNER woolie
[3:06:08] <%derap41> So I grinded a little
[3:06:24] <DSD24> Also go for fun
[3:06:26] <+oda_flobunaga> Play-through saved!
[3:06:26] <lotharrio> Definitely set up your combat gear.
[3:06:37] <+evbites> fann is defiantly going to have a scandal in the future
[3:06:41] <%laserbeaming> +3 Wisdom for Jedi Master
[3:06:44] <GoldeNOVA> KOTOR 2(FINAL)
[3:06:52] <ZeeJiggle> If ppl didn't get the memo by the time Twerka Industries was made, that's on them.
[3:06:54] <+Exicuren> Funsies is way better in KOTIR games
[3:07:03] <%laserbeaming> did he put on the gloves?
[3:07:07] <%Pillagius> use normal attack?
[3:07:20] <supuhmagikarp> change your stance usedQ usedQ
[3:07:23] <yukin0tora> Time to cheat
[3:07:24] <MajorBroloone> V, can you also not use the powers of scoot to cheese this fight?
[3:07:32] <CursedNobleman> F
[3:07:34] <%laserbeaming> Oh yeah, a different stance might help
[3:07:45] <lotharrio> Not stances, but gear.
[3:07:46] <siamzero94> no, just change gear and stance
[3:07:47] <+Exicuren> Can you pre activate jedi speed?
[3:07:51] <+doc_ock_rokc> put on a strenght fists
[3:07:52] <Aydarkzero> Woolie you're trapped on royal guard!
[3:07:59] <%laserbeaming> Dominator Gloves!
[3:07:59] <+Zanco23> I just found something funny. In the comic version of Episode 3, Yoda jumps through the air, and kicks Palpatine in the chest.
[3:08:01] <%subjectg> You guys need help? Wear armor that has damage resistance against melee
[3:08:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> @cursednobleman I'm still convinced that Planescape Torment has the best implementation of a Karma system. Good actions are abundant, but small increases, Evil actions are are far less abundant, but they're so fuck vile that they can completely 180 your alignment. It's the closest to a realistic karma system I've ever seen (also just being stupid evil just gets you fucked by an invicible npc cause you're causing shit in her city and she's stronger than a god).
[3:08:09] <Mr__Jebus> his AC is too high
[3:08:12] <+Exicuren> I don't.remember if you can
[3:08:38] <+oda_flobunaga> Completely agree on the Torment angle
[3:08:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> @commandersqueaks It's so good!
[3:08:47] <+tearknack> @CommanderSqueaks new vegas is similar, although not quite as good, as Torment
[3:08:47] <%laserbeaming> Torment is gud
[3:08:51] <Psyramics> Did woolie change his gear when I wasn't looking?
[3:08:55] <Psyramics> cause he should have
[3:08:56] <MajorBroloone> Woolie, try walking into him aggressively
[3:08:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> I still need to find the time to play through the remaster.
[3:09:05] <lotharrio> @Psyramics A little
[3:09:05] <CursedNobleman> @CommanderSqueaks every time i play planescape the actual gameplay just grinds me down till i stop midway. though ive read about some of the heinous crap you can do in that game. good stuff
[3:09:16] <%RacistWakka> !Uptime
[3:09:17] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 9 minutes
[3:09:18] <%subjectg> @woolieversus iirc you guys have armor that resists melee damage, you can upgrade it to have more melee resistance too
[3:09:26] <+oda_flobunaga> It is like 30 hours without grinding
[3:09:28] <Skullyton175> He don't miss
[3:09:29] <+Bluemanzee> You can do it!
[3:09:29] <+Estuko> Oooooh close!!
[3:09:33] <%heartlesshealer> daaang
[3:09:34] <%Gruhunchously> Damn that was close
[3:09:37] <lotharrio> Swap out regen for damage resistance?
[3:09:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> @cursednobleman Honestly, just read a guide on how to cheese the combat system, or find some mods that make it less of a slog. You're missing nothing by cheesing the combat system.
[3:09:51] <+Bluemanzee> Just leave 4Head
[3:09:51] <DSD24> @CommanderSqueaks Is there also the fact that the Nameless One has been evil and good throughout all his lives?
[3:09:56] <Zathas> "Well, time to cheat!"
[3:09:58] <+Estuko> "You don't deserve to be here, I beat you clearly" -coughing and hacking up blood-
[3:09:59] <siamzero94> change armour as well
[3:10:07] <%heartlesshealer> yeah armor
[3:10:07] <%Gruhunchously> Put some different armor on?
[3:10:11] <%laserbeaming> I'm sure they have a belt with DR 5/- on all physical things
[3:10:14] <%DatAsuna> WEAR MANDO ARMOR
[3:10:16] <CursedNobleman> @CommanderSqueaks ill just watch a lets play. i just play generic good guy in my rpgs anyhow LUL
[3:10:30] <Veteranhelldiver17> Can't hurt me through several layers of armor bitch
[3:10:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> @dsd24 I'ma send you a quick DM cause you're not exactly correct, but explaining it is super spoiler.
[3:10:41] <+oda_flobunaga> Nameless One has been everything at some point, except for a priest
[3:10:41] <lotharrio> Check Bao's gear?
[3:10:41] <+dragonzord12> you can buff before you talk for the fight and it won't be considered cheating
[3:10:57] <+oda_flobunaga> for reasons
[3:11:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> Jade Empire loves the heinous evil. The further you get in the game, the more your choices break down into "help souls move on and reincarnate like they should" or "annihilate souls forever for more power".
[3:11:07] <+oda_flobunaga> spoilery reasons
[3:11:19] <lotharrio> Any belts?
[3:11:31] <%Gruhunchously> That's an outfit
[3:11:32] <CursedNobleman> jade empire was mediocre, i mean i enjoyed it the first time, but mediocre
[3:11:34] <+Exicuren> get sum drugs
[3:11:41] <candidateplays> Wisdom doesn't count for defence unless you're wearing robes (Jel Shey armor doesn't cout)
[3:11:42] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[3:13:11] <%CommanderSqueaks> But I'ma stop with the Planescape Torment talk in case Woolie glances down here and we accidentally spoil something for him.
[3:13:12] <+krispen_wa> FOR MANDALORE
[3:13:19] <Heyestus> Let them fight
[3:13:19] <Graxe_> For Mandalore
[3:13:21] <+Exicuren> Now it's time to juice
[3:13:27] <%laserbeaming> FOR MANDALORE
[3:13:30] <+oda_flobunaga> We just need to keep telling him to play it
[3:13:30] <CursedNobleman> @CommanderSqueaks is he actually planning to play it?
[3:13:32] <megamirk> it's probably an inside meme at this point
[3:13:32] <DSD24> @CommanderSqueaks Its all good! I only know vague stuff about Torment but the karma stuff you were talking about was real interesting
[3:13:34] <%Gruhunchously> FOR MANDALOOOOORE
[3:13:35] <siamzero94> Bralor
[3:13:36] <+tearknack> @CursedNobleman if i was an evil sith, its totally how i would do things; all my students would have 1 or 2 gaping holes in their education
[3:13:36] <Veteranhelldiver17> for mandolore!
[3:13:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> @cursednobleman Trained wrong so this one weird trick can score an instant kill.
[3:13:42] <asylumkon> It's a recording in the helmet
[3:13:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> @cursednobleman I think he's looking to play it for himself at some point.
[3:13:45] <GoldeNOVA> For Mandalore! His channel is cool! Kappa
[3:13:45] <Jaku2011> FOR MANDALORE HNGHHHHH
[3:13:46] <%Jetzord> Bralor is unrestricted
[3:13:58] <+Invlux> Fox only. Final Destination.
[3:13:59] <DSD24> Swords Only Final Destination
[3:14:04] <DSD24> dang it too slow
[3:14:06] <siamzero94> this will either go well or completely horrible
[3:14:26] <+Invlux> Mandos play Melee with ITEMS OFF
[3:14:33] <%DatAsuna> @tearknack That's the main flaw of the rule of 2, either the apprentice kills the master too early to learn everything, or the master trains them badly to keep himself going
[3:14:43] <Graxe_> That was fast
[3:14:53] <CursedNobleman> the whole idea of having mediocre pupils so they dont screw you over is just terrible.
[3:14:53] <%Gruhunchously> Wow, I remember this fight being harder
[3:14:55] <+krispen_wa> Finn Bralor
[3:14:57] <Veteranhelldiver17> @Invlux fox only, final destination?
[3:15:11] <%Gruhunchously> Talk to one of the guys
[3:15:15] <%xcompleasedad> WE WANNA FIGHT
[3:15:17] <jorniev> just use shroyuken woolie
[3:15:19] <Doodle_Taco> Probably just sword being way better
[3:15:25] <+tearknack> @DatAsuna i was more thinking of having multiple apprentices, each with a different hole in their training; if any is smart enough to realize this, than they get to be my real apprentice
[3:15:32] <+killerkonnat> I put on my robe and wizard hat
[3:15:43] <%heartlesshealer> crouch in the corner, Woolie
[3:15:48] <+MagicBeanBurrito> GAH... AGH
[3:15:51] <lotharrio> +2 to hit and +3 DC which is a massive boost.
[3:15:57] <sendart> @invlux uwu
[3:16:01] <CursedNobleman> FAR MANDALORE LUL
[3:16:04] <megamirk> FOR MANDALORE
[3:16:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> @tearknack Or you do a Jade Empire and purposely include a flaw in your apprentice's teaching that only you can properly exploit.
[3:16:18] <Psyramics> oh, now you fucked. now you fucked
[3:16:19] <Veteranhelldiver17> LIGHTSABER
[3:16:20] <lotharrio> Saber times?
[3:16:23] <%laserbeaming> It's weird that it makes such a big difference at level 20. 3.5 math is weird

[3:16:26] <Psyramics> 3 minutes of buff time please
[3:16:42] <%alpharius88> zap is ass
[3:16:51] <%Jetzord> Bralor is honorable, but there's no pragmatism in that
[3:16:52] <CursedNobleman> at least in jade empire the only person that knows its a weakness is the master. everyone else is like, thats a weird thing you do. its weird
[3:16:53] <+Estuko> monksD
[3:16:55] <Jaku2011> Are we allowed to casually spoil Jade Empire?
[3:16:55] <+Estuko> monkaS
[3:16:58] <siamzero94> omg
[3:17:00] <+tearknack> @CommanderSqueaks im thinking of this from the pov of actually wanting to be a good teacher, but aslo being a bit evil, while Jade Empire is for when you're not really a teacher at all
[3:17:02] <%heartlesshealer> Those saves!
[3:17:03] <%Pillagius> he handled your lightsaber BAREHANDED

[3:18:08] <Veteranhelldiver17> Champions earn their place
[3:18:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> @tearknack Well the point in Jade Empire was he DID train him well, you are able to kick EVERYONE ELSE'S ass. Then you step up to him and he fucking bodies you cause he knows the one weakness you have.
[3:18:27] <Veteranhelldiver17> titles are worthless if you can't keep them
[3:18:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> @tearknack So it's more "Ima make you strong, but if you ever try to step to me, I can shut you down immediately."

[3:19:05] <Veteranhelldiver17> @CommanderSqueaks wasn't it because the master planted those weaknesses?
[3:19:15] <%heartlesshealer> You could up your mind stuff
[3:19:16] <%GeneralSCPatton> @veteranhelldiver17 Precisely
[3:19:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> @veteranhelldiver17 That's the point, a smart Sith Lord would do the same exact thing with his apprentice.
[3:19:29] <CursedNobleman> its a weakness only he understood though
[3:19:31] <BallerSwagBro9k> https://clips.twitch.tv/DeterminedUninterestedCatJebaited
[3:19:33] <lotharrio> Valor or Battle Meditation
[3:19:36] <%laserbeaming> Inspire Followers is pretty good. It's a Bard's Inspire Courage
[3:19:37] <DSD24> How about throw lightsaber?
[3:19:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> @cursednobleman That's da point
[3:19:42] <lotharrio> Push is good, too.
[3:19:49] <megamirk> life drain is baller
[3:19:55] <Veteranhelldiver17> @CommanderSqueaks i mean thats genius
[3:19:56] <DSD24> Force Choke
[3:19:59] <Jaku2011> I wish Jade Empire properly explained what the whole in your defense was
[3:20:05] <lotharrio> Woolie's gonna need Battle Meditation before too long.
[3:20:05] <Jaku2011> hole
[3:20:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> The villain in Jade Empire was a better SIth than ANYONE in Star Wars, don't @ me
[3:20:08] <CursedNobleman> force choke-a-bitch
[3:20:13] <Chisas_Dead_Body> Battle meditation
[3:20:13] <+dragonzord12> battle meditation
[3:20:19] <Veteranhelldiver17> @CommanderSqueaks at
[3:20:20] <megamirk> be like Bastilla
[3:20:27] <DSD24> I gotta replay Jade Empire I remember loving that game
[3:20:29] <Iwashi94> force choke in Jedi Knight Kreygasm
[3:20:34] <LordAlodar> Weird, my doppleganger is sitting with Woolie.
[3:20:35] <Psyramics> choke is more useful in the jedi knight series, when you can flick people off the edge of big pits with it
[3:20:43] <+MagicBeanBurrito> choke choke choke
[3:20:44] <+tearknack> @CommanderSqueaks you're right though
[3:20:53] <%wunp_fxs> too bad u wont get force crush...
[3:20:54] <+krispen_wa> PLAGUE
[3:20:54] <Jaku2011> Like I would love an in depth explanation of where my guard was down
[3:21:06] <+croxeye> Plague of Gripes is the ultimate Debuff?
[3:21:09] <Scrub_Seeker> force plague turns the target in to a furry
[3:21:10] <DSD24> Nothing more fun in Jedi Academy is choking someone and then throwing the lightsaber
[3:21:11] <%Gruhunchously> Eli is the ultimate debuff
[3:21:18] <%laserbeaming> Plague is fucking Cloudkill. Never underestimate Cloudkill
[3:21:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> @croxeye You're either debuffed by the cringe or by the weird boner you now have.
[3:21:26] <jorniev> force kills cells
[3:21:29] <lotharrio> Eli lowers all stats with his "I'm not a furry" explanation.
[3:21:31] <%subjectg> PlAgue is unfortunately bugged and useless in this one, unless it was fixed in the mod
[3:21:33] <CursedNobleman> i remember the heroes vs villains in battlefront 2. the force choke sith were the gas LUL
[3:21:50] <Klefth> Of course Plague would be the ultimate debuff
[3:22:00] <%GeneralSCPatton> @scrub_seeker Force Plague makes you frustrated in your horniness due to the almost-porn that never reveals more.
[3:22:07] <+oda_flobunaga> Plague of Gripes cast Skwick, it was super effective
[3:22:10] <megamirk> LUL
[3:22:11] <+krispen_wa> OOOH GOTTEM
[3:22:14] <ch3ggy> how did they kill him?
[3:22:17] <%subjectg> too bad plague is neither aoe or comes with instakill, unlike cloudkill
[3:22:18] <%heartlesshealer> LUL
[3:22:31] <%trustycoyote> For a 16 year old game, this is really fucking impressive visually and from a design perspective
[3:22:34] <+krispen_wa> "What a bitch"

[3:23:09] <%laserbeaming> "Your brother was a bitch and so are you"?
[3:23:21] <DSD24> @laserbeaming That's the one!

[3:23:24] <megamirk> gimme

[3:23:39] <CursedNobleman> @laserbeaming that line is straight gas
[3:23:46] <+evbites> only a sith mando would work
[3:23:51] <Veteranhelldiver17> big dick fanny
[3:23:55] <jorniev> a force using mandalorian would be fucked

[3:30:42] <%GeneralSCPatton> Kreia is a Master Karen. She wants to see the Force's manager.
[3:30:45] <DSD24> In Nioh 2 you can stack so many buffs to kill bosses in one hit
[3:31:02] <muniea3> mouth wipers?

[3:34:40] <lotharrio> @MooseoneLivedhere I've used them as a stealth based character. Sort of fun to set up massive traps, gain agrro and run away, laughing as they all explode and die.
[3:34:49] <MooseoneLivedhere> lol
[3:34:51] <DSD24> I liked the green

[3:46:13] <%DatAsuna> we don't need to be canon

[3:46:15] <%Pillagius> Wooo! Sweater shoulderpad beard!
[3:46:16] <+cinder_chan> I still think TOR is canon until they say otherwise, since they still produce a game taking place in it
[3:46:16] <Camail> official canon can go fuck itself
[3:46:17] <+Ixek> Disney has their own Canon.
[3:46:18] <DSD24> Rosh is a bitch

[3:46:52] <illTemperedSeaBass> I don't recognize Disney's mutilation of the Star Wars canon. The Expanded Universe is canon, and the movies ended at 6.

[3:47:21] <CursedNobleman> crappy wizards LUL
[3:47:23] <%Gruhunchously> BOOM Your're gay now
[3:47:27] <%Irridium> "And these characters all shit themselves"
[3:47:29] <+Estuko> ISn't she STILL trying to stay relevant
[3:47:30] <%DatAsuna> terminator does it every other movie tho
[3:47:31] <%GeneralSCPatton> Terminator Dark Fate rejects everything after 2
[3:47:32] <+TheOneCalledRock> like as far as i can tell ALL of DBGT got retconned\
[3:47:32] <jorniev> comics
[3:47:34] <Mr__Jebus> Godzilla
[3:47:34] <+oda_flobunaga> Star Trek Picard
[3:47:35] <DSD24> Anyone remember Genysis?
[3:47:41] <Shinny1338> 40k has no official cannon
[3:47:41] <jorniev> marvel an dc?
[3:47:42] <+evbites> dmc
[3:47:43] <+tearknack> @CommanderSqueaks whats JKR's explanation for the goblins lol
[3:47:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> @estuko You know what could do that? WRITE MORE BOOKS.
[3:47:47] <DSD24> I remember the terrible trailer
[3:47:48] <lotharrio> You get hard retcons or reboots fairly often... actually New 52 sort of did that. Since it basically just kept the major event comics as canon and just forgot the rest. Except Green Lantern because it was selling really well at the time.
[3:47:56] <+KamenOtaku> HALLOWEEN
[3:47:57] <%jiggy_snipe> Terminator is just Drakengard
[3:47:59] <%laserbeaming> woolieTRASH_SG
[3:48:10] <BallerSwagBro9k> J.K....am I gay?
[3:48:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> @jiggy_snipe With less pedophilia :3
[3:48:15] <%spiritofmojave> J.K Rowling uses that as a lazy way to gain a following, she's also a terf so fuck her
[3:48:15] <Camail> they have time travel from day 1
[3:48:19] <jorniev> FF7
[3:48:20] <+Estuko> @CommanderSqueaks I remember seeing a tweet about her talking about some anniversary of a battle in her books where characters died, THEN to go on and mention that it's probably not appropriate to talk about it too.
[3:48:21] <%DatAsuna> genisys was also a sequel to 2 not 3
[3:48:22] <Djinnazz> Salavtion is a sequal to 3
[3:48:23] <%GeneralSCPatton> I actually liked Dark Fate
[3:48:24] <Camail> its easy to just say they are all canon
[3:48:24] <+KamenOtaku> Halloween, the sequel to Halloween 2, the sequel to Halloween
[3:48:37] <jorniev> FINAL FANTASY

[3:48:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> @estuko Twitter has made society realize how important PR managers actually are.
[3:49:09] <+tearknack> eh, not like Lucas was amking that much good shit lol
[3:49:13] <%heyitsbrian> "hostile takeover" where George walked away with 4 billion bucks hahaha
[3:49:14] <%deviljhojho_> it was not ideal
[3:49:15] <lotharrio> Rolling for crits. High risk, high reward.
[3:49:15] <%emperordread> I refused to watch the sequels to the matrix because the story was clearly over after the first one in my mind. Later people told me that they wished they had done that too
[3:49:15] <ghoulishcripple> i thought Genysis undid 3?
[3:49:25] <+PhantomMiG> !time
[3:49:28] <+tearknack> im a prequels apologist but im not going to pretend that they were good
[3:49:36] <%caffienatedjedi> Like, people getting excited that the bad stuff is finally decanonized only for the first things to be stolen from old canon being the bad stuff
[3:49:41] <+Estuko> @emperordread Yeah, pretty much... I still watched because dumb fun but also djust dumb lol
[3:49:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> SHUT THE FUCK UP SPOILERS
[3:49:46] <BearSawed> Again I say 40k has a ton of retcons to the point that you have old vs new lore
[3:49:50] <%DatAsuna> that isn't spoilers
[3:49:56] <%DatAsuna> that's only old shit
[3:49:57] <Camail> HEY ASSHOLES IN CHAT, DON'T.
[3:49:58] <+jjjkopf> genysis is completely separate in it's own timeline, dark fate is a different sequel to T2 than T3

[3:53:46] <+evbites> spiderman's marriage
[3:53:57] <+prime_name> Didn't they recently erase Superman's family again?
[3:54:02] <%kyh9> @evbites Lol, "WE NEED TO MAINTAIN THE CANON"
[3:54:03] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1257528186524622851
[3:54:18] <Madbearv> it do
[3:54:18] <%kyh9> OR Marvel Ultimate as its own self-contained world
[3:54:19] <lotharrio> That's a Marvel thing. Sliding timeline. Nothing happened more than 13 years ago. DC had uhh... "hyper time" which I don't understand.
[3:54:20] <%GeneralSCPatton> Comic books often give a metaphysical cause for the reboot. It's not just an authorial declaration of "didn't happen".
[3:54:20] <Doodle_Taco> There have been like 3 universal reboots right?
[3:54:26] <gastherobots> A lot of it is always an event, the things before still happen, but some large villain shatters the timeline or something. Or like Star Trek, a different universe that Spok went into. While with Star Wars it was just swiped away.
[3:54:37] <%TheFabledAble> I could never get super into super hero comics because they are constantly rehashing, redoing, remaking, reboot of the continuity and as a person who wanted to dive in that was a MAJOR turn off from american comics
[3:54:38] <+evbites> we should have kept old man logan it's a great design
[3:54:44] <%Ashenik1> 11
[3:54:47] <Djinnazz> 12
[3:54:49] <%jiggy_snipe> 11 or 12
[3:54:50] <+jjjkopf> 2007-2019
[3:54:51] <Madbearv> its every 13 years and then we loop around and do it again
[3:54:52] <+oda_flobunaga> 2008
[3:54:52] <%kyh9> 2008
[3:54:53] <%jiggy_snipe> 08 i think
[3:55:02] <%jinking79> Ultimate universe gave us Miles, New 52 happen cause of Dr Manhattan
[3:55:06] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus The 13 year Sliding Scale is more about the world events. Like people who would be in the Vietnam War were now in the Iraq war, ect.
[3:55:15] <+aishman> There is a bunch of events that recon shit constantly though
[3:55:18] <gastherobots> Like in universe universe reset vs just business.
[3:55:19] <%TheFabledAble> I way prefer a continual narrative over rehashing the old and slaping a new label on it. "This version of peter parker is by [insert writer here]"
[3:55:20] <Augus7717> LUL
[3:55:22] <+prime_name> 7?
[3:55:28] <+Exicuren> Marvel resets the number back to 1 with a new title if a series gets too high in issued comics

[0:09:03] <+Vegaburd> @saladin1911 pog
[0:09:10] <fatally_furious> @irridium you are not wrong
[0:09:13] <@akuda_bar> woolie comes out and the whole chat is all upset and crying over the song
[0:09:20] <fatally_furious> probably 2 tons too
[0:09:20] <%gatorafan> I kinda hate they didn't bother to touch the lyrics on the male version of the song, still a good version tho
[0:09:20] <+saladin1911> @vegaburd gop
[0:09:22] <+Prevot> Nier but Wario is the dad instead
[0:09:44] <spirittiart> salty party salt comes from tiers
[0:09:45] <0rond> nier but yonah is wario
[0:09:51] <+mighty_max_t> I hope Babylon's Fall scratches that Automata itch, gameplay wise
[0:09:54] <fatally_furious> @prevot closest we'll get to another warioland at least
[0:09:56] <Graxe_> Game and Wario, huh

[0:09:58] <%gatorafan> Would Wario put up with Yonah's shit?
[0:09:58] <snakesonabane> the ffxiv twitch chat when they revealed the remix of this song was something else
[0:10:07] <valriot> Yonah is a garlic clove
[0:10:10] <+saladin1911> Nier but Woolie is Yonah and Minh is papa
[0:10:17] <veraverse> Plot twist: The live is only a excuse to Woolie show off his music playlist

[0:35:33] <T_Sasquatch> Just because it's on Snopes doesn't mean shit LMAO
[0:35:36] <+Flambage> It was a loophole that is real but wouldn't hold up in court

[0:36:15] <+laxomusic> you're just AFRAID OF THE TRUTH
[0:36:16] <%CaptainPileDriver> The constitutional loophole in this area was discovered by Michigan State University law professor Brian C. Kalt while he was planning to write an essay about technicalities of the Sixth Amendment, which entitles citizens to a fair and quick trial. Kalt wondered about a hypothetical place where there were not enough eligible citizens to form a jury and theorized that there could be no trial and therefore no punishment for major crimes in that area.
[0:36:27] <+bread_assassin> Don't doubt me, Woolie
[0:36:28] <valriot> America is fuckin dumb LUL

[0:37:09] <ShawnEXE> That's what happens when you don't connect the chiral network
[0:37:11] <%CaptainPileDriver> However, the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution decrees that a trial must happen both within the district and state of where the crime was committed. Because of this, a crime committed in the "Zone of Death" would be constitutionally required to be tried in and include only jury members from the Zone.

[0:52:10] <0rond> is there no wario ware type game for the switch? you'd they push it harder considering the switch basically encourages this type of thing with stuff like 1 2 switch
[0:52:15] <jumad390> i want to see them do Gamer so bad
[0:52:15] <StaticSunrise> it's a tech demo
[0:52:18] <waterstealer> no they are microgames

[2:23:47] <DedlokPM> @Arek_1 Woolie showed him in the first episode of Fighterpedia as a factoid of him being in the cut content in SF2, then used him as a running gag in the rest of the the Fighterpedia episodes. Then he became a kind of Best Friends Play staple and then the guys kickstarter tiered him into various games
[2:23:56] <+dmtjinni> I swear there is no stream like The Woolie Versus‚Ñ¢ stream
[2:24:03] <MrMysteryMask> when do you think they'll implement ggpo on this

[2:59:12] <+Prevot> I mean, they only made one game
[2:59:15] <Saltmeisterr> normal reize haz sum gud stuff
[2:59:26] <%allups> is tht the last game of the night
[2:59:38] <clamlamity> "One game" that's like, 3 or 4 games in one.
[2:59:39] <Saltmeisterr> they might as well made 5 games at this point
[2:59:42] <fatally_furious> @prevot so have team cherry, but they might as well be multiple
[2:59:49] <%mayorrev> its the best
[2:59:53] <%mayorrev> so much content
[3:00:13] <fatally_furious> that one guy is right, indie games are too cheap
[3:00:15] <Saltmeisterr> its a bit more expense tho
[3:00:30] <Saltmeisterr> right now treasure trove is 40 bucks
[3:00:35] <%allups> i only play it on vita
[3:00:37] <@Solidus_113> Jake Kaufman, the absolute god on the music
[3:00:38] <Saltmeisterr> I think it used to be 25?
[3:00:47] <%allups> ik bought it there ima keep it there
[3:00:49] <@Solidus_113> You can buy all the OSTs on his Bandcamp
[3:00:50] <DedlokPM> yeah I think they raised the price up to $40 once the king knight and showdown released
[3:00:50] <+Prevot> cave story is so old tho, was it even retro back then?
[3:01:11] <@Solidus_113> Treasure Trove with Showdown is $40 now
[3:01:25] <NiktenKing> Shoveled dirt cheap even
[3:01:38] <DedlokPM> @WoolieVersus they raised the price up to $40 once the king knight expansion and showdown released
[3:01:47] <Solidnick18> PogChamp
[3:01:59] <fatally_furious> good, they deserve the cash for making 3 megaman games and the second good platform fighter
[3:02:01] <Saltmeisterr> its still worth it at 40 bucks
[3:02:04] <+Prevot> The Baz amiibo when
[3:02:04] <+jiggy_snipe> I think it's interesting that Shovel Knight gets more expensive over time
[3:02:08] <acewulf77> Shoulder Knight when
[3:02:09] <Lamedhos> The Baz lives again
[3:02:10] <SiegeJay> @Solidus_113 Only issue with Jake Kaufman is his Gamergate involvement.
[3:02:13] <%mayorrev> Shovel Knight and Baz are the cameo kings
[3:02:18] <%yeknomlive> FOR GLORY
[3:02:24] <%The_Timo> HAHAHAH

[3:46:00] <DedlokPM> the grabbed person wants to maintain balance, the grabber wants to get it unbalanced it looks like @WoolieVersus
[3:46:01] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:46:32] <Graxe_> I'm not really feeling this one.
[3:47:00] <Graxe_> Maybe it's one of those where you have to play it to get it
[3:47:19] <Uselesswhitenoise> i hope they get to some of the three players games
[3:47:20] <DedlokPM> It's more mind games than straight out fighting, so yeah I can see how people would not like it as much
[3:47:25] <fatally_furious> maybe it'd be clearer if youve played Karate Champ
[3:47:37] <startstoprepeat> it's gotta be really quick for an ippon
[3:47:41] <@Solidus_113> Ippon is instant
[3:47:58] <Uselesswhitenoise> how long the struggle last
[3:48:24] <SuperKirby24> this reminds me of the ljn snes wwf games
[3:48:38] <SuperKirby24> with that momentum meter
[3:49:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> so from what i've been catching about capcom cup, the fucking setup was lagging stupid hard
[3:49:24] <+leomuratore> Gat into fighting games: Mario and Sonic at the Olympics

[3:52:35] <metabot64> woolie has to have the capcom cup open on the side or some shit right?
[3:52:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> i cannot believe the setup at capcom cup is so bad that they stopped mid set to fix it
[3:52:49] <CirclesForever> wow sam sho looks cool
[3:52:59] <%CaptainPileDriver> @metabot64 no

[3:53:32] <SuperKirby24> Oh yeah i forgot olympic fencing uses sensors on their swords now
[3:53:46] <invisi_bliss> holy shit that beeping sound is killing me
[3:54:03] <fatally_furious> who's mic is freaking out
[3:54:04] <+razielhex> yeah, I used to fence, it's distracting

[3:54:09] <+RealPT1> active flow
[3:54:11] <%yeknomlive> it's the game
[3:54:14] <WG101> nyo-ho
[3:54:14] <EnderGamma> it's the score counter not the mic
[3:54:20] <+Vostroyan1> that beeping sound is a fencing thing?
[3:54:28] <+razielhex> yeah
[3:54:30] <WG101> Go! Go! Waluigi!
[3:54:32] <SuperKirby24> yea, it makes a sound when a hit connects
[3:54:34] <fatally_furious> @breakfast_megapowers they didnt bother to change the win animations for the versus
[3:54:45] <+Jintais3rd> Even his athletic shoes are toe pointed
[3:54:50] <+razielhex> they have special sensors on the suit that are connected to a machine and if the tip of the rapier/epee/saber touches it the machine beeps
[3:54:50] <BestTeaMaker> is that beeping coming from here
[3:54:52] <%yeknomlive> "AMY"
[3:54:57] <beatie_g> Waluigi is a stick. Egg man has no chance
[3:55:00] <+Jintais3rd> ADRENALINE
[3:55:06] <fatally_furious> why did they choose a beep like that for hits
[3:55:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> i cannot believe capcom cup is actually being as bad as it is
[3:55:10] <invisi_bliss> sounds like my god damn smoke alarm jeeezus

[3:56:04] <Sogeki_Dan> Do you think they notice the range markers?
[3:56:18] <fatally_furious> @superkirby24 there isnt full hand eye coordination at play here
[3:56:38] <Breakfast_Megapowers> Undefeated Mario

[0:28:38] <+Javaa01> @zaptar13 It didn't flop, but it definitely under performed because of it, and most people missed out on it because of that, even though its by far the best game out of the three
[0:28:38] <+fingalights> @derap41 Yo that sounds dope

[0:47:33] <derap41> Roads are like 90% player and 10% online
[0:47:39] <+tuchpi> "so I grinded a little off screen.."
[0:48:04] <+DesertPenguin> They really should have modeled these roads with some barriers this is very unsafe
[0:48:22] <%sjay449> "roads trivialize the game".
[0:48:23] <worldbrand> some mule speared me while i was on the highway

[0:50:03] <+Javaa01> Also, BTs can't be on roads, even if a road goes through a BT saturated area, you'll be safe from them so long as you don't get off the road
[0:50:15] <derap41> you should thank them them leaving shit means you can pick it up

[1:00:35] <%sjay449> Looking cool Joker
[1:00:45] <%QaizerArt> Ah goddamn it, it didn't happen
[1:00:49] <%QaizerArt> I think it's a bug.
[1:00:59] <+linSP> kojima taught me beer and monster give you stamina so i mix both before a run
[1:01:08] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> time for mads

[1:01:47] <%ChoculaUltra> wet Mads woolieMIRIN
[1:02:06] <%QaizerArt> If you fuck with the cryptobiotes while drunk, seems like there's a chance he'll grab the jar, throw it up and down while fucking with it and break it. Liam showed it off when he got to the scene. @WoolieVersus
[1:02:11] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> BibleThump
[1:02:16] <jase__x> make em moist mads
[1:02:20] <+Javaa01> What a terrible day for rain
[1:02:27] <%QaizerArt> Sorry for pinging so much too
[1:02:28] <+locutus_of_the_porg> mads you're dripping on me OwO
[1:02:31] <masterfire23> its a terrible day for rain
[1:02:55] <Necnill> Daddy, you're getting me we... you know what, it's too easy
[1:03:01] <+fingalights> Get more LIKES
[1:03:16] <Louie_Salmon> Nice, that's the way to go
[1:03:25] <+Javaa01> Premium deliveries are really important if you wanna get those last few stars
[1:03:32] <Louie_Salmon> Premium deliveries usually aren't much harder anyway
[1:03:38] <+linSP> get that yummy likecin
[1:06:50] <Rosswelle> mules get to be a bit of a bitch later...make sure you keep a bola gun on you
[1:07:03] <serpenttucker> The trike is the best for off-road rough terrain IMO. You get that bitch up on a wheelie, and you can get to some STUPID places.
[1:07:20] <Mendin> skyrim horse that bike everywhere
[1:07:44] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> parry the radar
[1:08:10] <+bread_assassin> I could never get the timing down for ping parries.
[1:08:10] <+linSP> see that mountain? you can ride with norman reedus up there
[1:08:15] <%sjay449> isn't there a massive gap here?
[1:08:21] <serpenttucker> In fact, IIRC the wheelie mostly stops getting caught up by rocks
[1:08:43] <+fingalights> Wheelie helps alot on this
[1:08:43] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:08:44] <+Mkingston> just joined. Has he hit Episode 4 for?
[1:08:55] <Rosswelle> still in ep 3
[1:08:59] <%sjay449> no, he's still in 3
[1:09:01] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Woolie ohno
[1:09:01] <+Mkingston> thanks
[1:09:02] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> yes
[1:09:09] <serpenttucker> @Mkingston doing the junk dealer stuff now
[1:09:12] <%sjay449> bike has been Austin Powered
[1:09:15] <serpenttucker> Or rather, about to
[1:09:19] <+Mkingston> thanks guys
[1:09:23] <+Javaa01> Yeah, you can unlock preppers earlier then the story lets you normally by returning lost cargo to them
[1:09:31] <mrgrimsmiles> im feel bad for the bike
[1:10:05] <+Mkingston> I wonder if he'll recognize the film director
[1:10:17] <trichan> sooo i just read a bunch of the wiki for this game and
[1:10:19] <fruit_pie_the_magician> UNBEATABLE BANZUKE
[1:10:20] <+fingalights> Bike-chan was left behind
[1:10:22] <trichan> kojima is bananas
[1:10:30] <%mayorrev> how many celebs has he encountered this session
[1:10:38] <%mayorrev> oh that's uhhhhhh
[1:10:38] <%Irridium> that's king kong man
[1:10:47] <+Mkingston> He's the director of the Metal Gear movie that will never come.
[1:10:51] <%sjay449> The guy directing the Metal Gear Movie
[1:10:55] <KamiiFlow> CarlSmile
[1:11:02] <worldbrand> drake directs the kinds of movies that send you to jail
[1:11:06] <+fingalights> oh no
[1:11:18] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> I don't believe the holograms are real people
[1:11:20] <+heyitsdenzel_> Jordan Vogt-Roberts director of Kings of Summer and Kong Skull Island
[1:11:35] <%mayorrev> yea Jordan
[1:11:38] <serpenttucker> It takes about 2/5 stars to get most preppers on the network
[1:11:46] <KamiiFlow> why would he say that
[1:11:47] <Crashfan01> which chapter are we on?
[1:12:01] <+Mkingston> @Crashfan01 3
[1:12:10] <%sjay449> You see how much shit he talked about Black Widow because he is saying it's ripping of MGS3?
[1:12:15] <Rosswelle> metal gear IS a movie honestly
[1:12:15] <jase__x> got a long way to go
[1:12:17] <+PenmanLupine> it doesn't need a movie but here's hoping it could be cool.
[1:12:20] <yukichocomilk> the games are movies already
[1:12:23] <+fingalights> Can movies HANDLE MGS
[1:12:33] <+PenmanLupine> Metal Gear is very cinematic anyway so it's not like there's gameplay elements that would be missing.
[1:12:39] <eiightbiitt> The Witcher series is pretty good
[1:12:47] <trichan> is that drake
[1:12:50] <+DesertPenguin> Witcher series is awesome
[1:12:56] <+fingalights> But Witcher was a book first
[1:13:00] <Mendin> Get ye Raybans
[1:13:01] <jase__x> LUL
[1:13:02] <+linSP> the movie needs to be serious and goofy
[1:13:06] <serpenttucker> @WoolieVersus You can equip those right now if you access the D-pad up menu
[1:13:07] <+PenmanLupine> J.F Rey lives on
[1:13:17] <Ashenik1> @DesertPenguin dude I can fight you the whole stream about that !!!
[1:13:21] <eiightbiitt> yeah but the game made it shine
[1:13:22] <derap41> woolieYE
[1:13:23] <+Mkingston> I turned mine into specs
[1:13:26] <+DesertPenguin> About the Witcher show being good?
[1:13:35] <+DesertPenguin> I never read the books or played the games. It's just entertaining to me
[1:13:38] <Ashenik1> YEEAAHH
[1:14:00] <Ashenik1> Man it sucks as a show !!
[1:14:03] <+DesertPenguin> How?
[1:14:08] <+DesertPenguin> Btw only 4 episodes in
[1:14:20] <+Mkingston> Just finished episode 3
[1:14:34] <Ashenik1> editing, lightning, pacing, wirting
[1:14:38] <Prevot> Superman is surprisingly a good geraldo
[1:14:40] <pmtriox> death deathing
[1:14:43] <%Irridium> only played the games but I actually enjoyed the show more than I thought I would. Decent enough time.
[1:14:44] <derap41> Yeah make sure you bring a friend with you
[1:14:48] <serpenttucker> Stand deathing
[1:14:57] <+DesertPenguin> Okay agree to disagree. Moving on...
[1:15:03] <+Mkingston> Make sure you take all your friends with you
[1:15:05] <Ashenik1> NOOOO
[1:15:07] <eiightbiitt> it needs more depth hopefully there will be more in the future
[1:15:09] <%QaizerArt> Anyone who hasn't played the game, hot springs are basically big time stamina restorers
[1:15:11] <Mendin> You're on the area chiral network so it appeared
[1:15:18] <%GeneralSCPatton> PLAYERS ERODE TERRAIN! THE ROCKS HAVE BEEN REDUCED!
[1:15:18] <Ashenik1> I need blood!!
[1:15:22] <+DesertPenguin> It's a bike ramp
[1:15:36] <serpenttucker> Does woolie know that the more poeple he "tracks" in this game, the more likely he will get their structures in his world?
[1:15:39] <Ashenik1> After everyone lving it on reddit and tiwter I need blood!!
[1:15:41] <+Mkingston> Wollie, how are you finding the new bigger text patch?
[1:15:43] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> the ground got smoother...
[1:15:43] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:15:43] <Prevot> oh man that's one garish bike
[1:16:10] <Rosswelle> bigger text patch?
[1:16:10] <+linSP> what madman thought to take a dip in hot oddly colored water and figured out it was food for you
[1:16:22] <+linSP> good*
[1:16:31] <Rosswelle> was that patch recent?
[1:16:36] <+Mkingston> @Rosswelle yes, all the on-screen text is now bigger.
[1:16:37] <Mendin> As Liam says: "STUNTS!"
[1:16:48] <chronoxgp> MAKE TEXT BIGGER
[1:16:52] <+Mkingston> The patch came out about 2 weeks ago
[1:16:54] <Crashfan01> we stuntin'?!
[1:16:58] <Ashenik1> @DesertPenguin no but like did you like the pacing of it? I dont mean time jumping but like how the sotry moves forward?
[1:17:07] <Cruel_Tentacles> So...Death Stranding.
[1:17:07] <derap41> Its really fucking good and wouildn have been made if not from the books
[1:17:11] <Rosswelle> ah, i probably havent seen the original size then
[1:17:17] <StarlitStunner> rooWut someone pushing their contrarian opinion as fact, guess Pat made another alt-account. stripEvil @ashenik1
[1:17:23] <theamazingroberto> he should have titled his book the bitcher
[1:17:24] <%Irridium> it is based off the books more than the games but Caville is definitely trying to do Doug Cockle's voice
[1:17:25] <Mendin> The book writer, you mean
[1:17:28] <SomersaultJustice> the creator and cd project came to an agreement
[1:17:30] <+fingalights> He hustled himself
[1:17:38] <KamiiFlow> gimme da loot
[1:17:38] <+solzan2000> he thought games was dumb
[1:17:40] <Sol_Install> yep
[1:17:45] <Prevot> but the voice he's doing for geralt is 100% from the games tho
[1:17:46] <YeetMyMeatOffTheStreet> Hi
[1:17:52] <OldManDeckardCain> games made in poland didn't sell well back then tbf
[1:17:54] <Ashenik1> @StarlitStunner i guess its just a frustration afte reveryone loving it :D
[1:17:57] <derap41> he played himself and got angry because he didn't think games where a trillion dollar industry
[1:18:03] <jase__x> this old FOOL
[1:18:09] <+ClaudeMcGarren> hes an idiot lol
[1:18:11] <serpenttucker> TBF he probably would have been right in most cases
[1:18:15] <Ilkim61> @linsp with all other batural instances of water being cold as heck, the hot water becomes the best thing ever by default
[1:18:24] <+GarbageNirvana> "It's my money, and I need it NOOOOW"
[1:18:25] <+linSP> the witcher writer exudes pure boomer energy
[1:18:28] <%GeneralSCPatton> Cheer500 Did you notice the rocks around the film director becoming less awful after linking him? Players don't just make footpaths but also erode rocks and bullshit terrain.
[1:18:29] <%GeneralSCPatton> GeneralSCPatton's Cheer shared rewards to 10 others in Chat! 
[1:18:33] <+Javaa01> Yeah, he was salty and bitter about it for like 11 years
[1:18:39] <spacecatstreams> boolie
[1:18:50] <Cruel_Tentacles> General Patton in chat!
[1:18:51] <Prevot> he was a bitch and a fool
[1:18:52] <derap41> I mean go back to Witcher 1 and its not that strange of him tinking that
[1:18:53] <Ashenik1> @WoolieVersus and before CDPR Witcher there was another video game that was a total desaster and terrible movie
[1:18:54] <Charuzu> What a dumb reason to choose and inherently inferior choice
[1:19:01] <+Blue256> actual boomer
[1:19:11] <theamazingroberto> alan moore without the beard basically
[1:19:28] <+Mkingston> Toss a coin to your Boomer

[1:29:53] <Cruel_Tentacles> @Mkingston Does the Spider-Man 2 pizza theme play during pizza deliveries?
[1:29:54] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:29:57] <+GarbageNirvana> @Ashenik1 I mean he still nails things Cage completely misses the mark on imo
[1:29:57] <Darkrenai> Go into this totally normal area
[1:30:00] <Darkrenai> and come back
[1:30:23] <Darkrenai> Kappa
[1:30:24] <derap41> That place is so cool
[1:30:29] <+GarbageNirvana> @Ashenik1 Also Kojima's games are actually fun
[1:30:35] <Grahfvitnir> Oh this one's a goodie alright limesO
[1:30:49] <lindy94> DONT LICK IT!
[1:30:50] <%GeneralSCPatton> @ashenik1 Yeah, there is a thin line between Kojima and Cahgay, but that line separates the gaming equivalent of Tarantino and the Omnihack.
[1:30:53] <Ashenik1> @GarbageNirvana I agree but with it he also makes cagelike sotry stuff
[1:30:59] <+Javaa01> The floating carrier is practically vital for this
[1:31:02] <+Mkingston> She's 21
[1:31:40] <%Irridium> it does not
[1:31:40] <+Mkingston> @Javaa01 not really
[1:31:41] <+Javaa01> The lake is right of the city ruins
[1:31:46] <serpenttucker> @WoolieVersus This is your tutorial on throwing packages essentially
[1:31:50] <%hooppawesomeness> hooppawesomeness subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! Woolie do good content
[1:31:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> THE LAKE IS A TAR PIT
[1:32:00] <%Irridium> The lake's exactly south of the junk dealer
[1:32:00] <+experimental_jet> lake is south
[1:32:07] <Nested_Dreams> Chiralium Bath Salts?
[1:32:07] <+Tonku_the_Red> Straight down from there.
[1:32:08] <Ashenik1> Cage is a fraud but Kojima is a "talented" fraud :d
[1:32:12] <+Mkingston> lake is the big black mass to the south
[1:32:19] <+fingalights> It's the big dark spot south of you
[1:32:25] <%Irridium> no the place just to the right of the mission area
[1:32:33] <+Mkingston> SOUTH
[1:32:39] <+fingalights> The one that looks like a lake
[1:32:40] <+Mkingston> THAT
[1:32:43] <+bread_assassin> Lake is directly to the right of the circle.
[1:32:46] <serpenttucker> yet
[1:32:55] <+fingalights> It doesn't matter now anyways
[1:32:58] <derap41> 20 minute adveture
[1:32:58] <Cruel_Tentacles> @Ashenik1 I mean...Kojima used to make games that were really, really good though. Cage never did.
[1:33:21] <Ashenik1> Like I said fraud vs talented fraud ;p
[1:33:21] <derap41> You really should bring a truck
[1:33:23] <+Mkingston> the big black mass to the right of that circle
[1:33:53] <Xanestus> woolie should brute force his way through a BT area on a trike
[1:34:11] <Cruel_Tentacles> Anyone else here watching You Season 2?
[1:34:16] <+Mkingston> Woolie doesn't know the difference between a lake and a river
[1:34:52] <lindy94> or a rake and liver...
[1:35:01] <chronoxgp> merica
[1:35:41] <+Tonku_the_Red> Man, I *HATE* the crunch noise the cryptobites make when they eat then.
[1:35:50] <+Tonku_the_Red> them*
[1:35:55] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> time for spooks
[1:35:57] <+GarbageNirvana> They don't even look like they have bones
[1:35:58] <Xanestus> then dont eat them Kappa
[1:36:05] <serpenttucker> I wish we could skip THAT animation.
[1:36:15] <Grahfvitnir> Time for """""fun"""""""
[1:36:16] <chronoxgp> someone should make a potato chip bag and then put cryptobiotes on the cover
[1:36:50] <chronoxgp> you can play this whole game with the HUD off you know....
[1:37:15] <+Mkingston> @chronoxgp no thanks
[1:37:16] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:37:39] <+GarbageNirvana> Someone tell Woolie he can carry it by hand and load it onto the carrier manually
[1:37:47] <+GarbageNirvana> He's gonna spend way too much time in menus otherwise
[1:37:58] <%Irridium> you can pick it up with the triggers, look at the carrier, and set it on it without having to use the menus
[1:37:58] <+Javaa01> I think you can just grab it with your hand and then place it on the carrier so you don't have to go through the menu
[1:38:38] <zayasu> monkaS
[1:38:47] <+GarbageNirvana> Hope you brought some piss
[1:39:08] <derap41> This is one of the spookiest zones
[1:39:19] <chronoxgp> there are a lot of tells for when something is low or running out so much you don't need the helpers on screen
[1:39:51] <+Tonku_the_Red> @xanestus I didn't for most of my playthrough, but everytime Fragile is on screen for a cutscene she's chomping down on them.
[1:41:03] <%Irridium> @WoolieVersus you can pick the packages up with your hands and just set them onto the carrier without using the menu
[1:41:33] <Infinit_Phoenix> I said fuck it got caught so I could just fight a boss and clear the bts
[1:41:50] <%GeneralSCPatton> Blood does damage/kill, and everything else is pointless
[1:42:16] <+Mkingston> @GeneralSCPatton this
[1:42:28] <%GeneralSCPatton> Killing doesn't draw aggro, so you can just carve a bloody swathe in stealth mode
[1:42:35] <+Tonku_the_Red> Yeah, the fluid grenades become useless once blood grenades are available.
[1:42:50] <+Mkingston> then the golden BTs come
[1:43:04] <Xanestus> i usually just end up donating the fluid grenades to a locker
[1:43:11] <%Irridium> that being said while it does nothing it does give me an odd sense of satisfaction throwing my shit at things
[1:43:14] <+Sendaar> I think this is the point where I just said fuck it and fought the bt boss every time they were in my way
[1:43:23] <Milo_Oda> doesnt piss n shit still do damage to bosses and such? like Mgs tranq rounds working on bosses n such
[1:44:01] <%GeneralSCPatton> @milo_oda Nope
[1:44:03] <Aydarkzero> i thought they could hear sound
[1:44:10] <+Tonku_the_Red> Fluid will damage bosses, but for a tiny sliver of health. Blood is the only way to go.
[1:44:22] <Milo_Oda> @GeneralSCPatton dang really thats a kinda a bummer

[1:48:52] <Aydarkzero> David Cage will return
[1:48:57] <%GeneralSCPatton> Omikron began the death of the channel
[1:49:06] <%redrins> reggie needs to play omikron with the busted controls they played with
[1:49:15] <zayasu> omikron WutFace
[1:49:18] <black_pariah> never mind his games he's kinda a piece of shit as a person
[1:49:20] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> SPITE
[1:49:21] <AxelCezar> you are locked in the CAGE
[1:49:21] <SomersaultJustice> omikron killed the channel
[1:49:23] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> nothing but SPITE for Cage
[1:49:28] <+Tonku_the_Red> @generalscpatton It was also their greatest achievement.
[1:49:32] <chronoxgp> even the fps part was terrible
[1:49:36] <+Hollow_Mirage> David Cage: If the player game overs its the fault of the developer
[1:49:37] <+Mkingston> But they sell
[1:49:46] <StarlitStunner> A waste of David Bowie rooFeels
[1:49:49] <+Razputin217> Detroit: Become Human 4EVA LETS GO
[1:49:53] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> "Possessed killer"
[1:49:53] <+Tonku_the_Red> I mean, the David Bowie music in Omikron was pretty good
[1:49:58] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> not Zombie Demigod
[1:50:15] <chronoxgp> product placement
[1:50:21] <+apocplz> i think something must be wrong with me...i loved Heavy Rain NotLikeThis
[1:50:26] <Graxe_> The Orange Clan
[1:50:28] <+Superbro64> reminder that omnikron practically killed the channel
[1:50:29] <Graxe_> And the Purple Clan
[1:50:31] <+Mkingston> His games are Michael Bay's Transformers. Garbage that sells.
[1:50:34] <Aydarkzero> Heavy Rain was my first David Cage experience
[1:50:34] <derap41> David cage the liar
[1:50:36] <+linSP> coming 2030, a kojima-cage production
[1:50:47] <zayasu> detroid is his best game
[1:50:47] <+Tonku_the_Red> David Cage games have great hooks. He has great ideas, but when he expands upon them they catch fire.
[1:50:48] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Oh Woolie is going off LUL

[1:54:47] <chronoxgp> spyTea
[1:54:50] <%redrins> sweet home
[1:54:55] <%QaizerArt> time for the most annoying delivery in the game!
[1:55:09] <Blackjackal95> ending cutscene of this mission is so awkward
[1:55:14] <+Mkingston> @QaizerArt That's Pizza delivery #3
[1:55:19] <%Irridium> "parent"
[1:55:23] <AxelCezar> this will get weird in a moment
[1:55:29] <+Hollow_Mirage> Is it gonna be that dumb Hourglass she was holding?
[1:55:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> Parent? You mean lover?
[1:55:36] <%QaizerArt> @Mkingston that one's a joke when you know the correct route
[1:55:40] <AThing_> @AxelCezar it's already kind of weird
[1:55:48] <%QaizerArt> This one is a just genuine pain in the ass
[1:55:50] <chronoxgp> CAPTIVATING GAMEPLAY
[1:55:51] <NotHereToStream> i've heard the end cutscene of this mission was ad libbed by the actor and kojima left it in...its what i've heard
[1:55:52] <%Lion_kun> No one spoil it!
[1:56:00] <+linSP> this whole sequence gets really weird and funny especially after the emails you get after
[1:56:00] <derap41> Yeah that Kojima naming
[1:56:13] <Graxe_> It's super fragile
[1:56:16] <Graxe_> Like Jason's neck
[1:56:23] <+mrhandsss> i definitely feel this whole junk dealer thing was a bit of a misfire. not because i mind having to put a pause on the mission to help people, just how cringy this part was
[1:56:24] <%cache_22> Let's hope Woolie does note fall down a hole this time.
[1:56:26] <Ashenik1> SHE SAID THE THING
[1:56:26] <chronoxgp> it's fragile, frageelay
[1:56:26] <black_pariah> DONT STUMBO
[1:56:32] <Xanestus> But not *that* fragile.
[1:56:34] <Graxe_> Treat the hourglass like Jason
[1:56:36] <+Mkingston> @linSP those emails are the funniest
[1:56:42] <AThing_> my girrrrlllll
[1:56:42] <+Mkingston> She's his lover
[1:56:46] <Aydarkzero> yeah HIS girl
[1:56:46] <derap41> Girlfriend
[1:56:56] <StarlitStunner> I’m fragile, but not that fragile stripSmug
[1:56:57] <%redrins> you dont call your girl your girl?
[1:56:59] <AxelCezar> well, i bet she call him daddy too
[1:57:03] <%Lion_kun> Incest is wincest
[1:57:04] <Prevot> does he look old enough to have a daughter that old
[1:57:09] <zayasu> not that fragile 4Head
[1:57:09] <+fingalights> HE SIAD THE THING
[1:57:09] <ShershaAD> @woolieversus hey woolz quick questiom, do you think dong dong will ever come to evo?
[1:57:09] <Graxe_> This is a chiral hourglass
[1:57:10] <+mrhandsss> basically everyone assumes its his daughter at first
[1:57:11] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> Eh. it wasn't really all that cringy
[1:57:11] <OldManDeckardCain> "daddy's girl" LUL
[1:57:18] <Graxe_> Super fragile than normal hourglasses
[1:57:48] <%Lion_kun> I really got the daughter vibe up till they proposed and I was WTF?
[1:57:53] <+AlexDemille> ... that's a shit game mechanic.
[1:57:58] <Graxe_> Speed
[1:58:03] <Graxe_> Fast
[1:58:04] <Aydarkzero> b o o s t
[1:58:04] <+Mkingston> Imagine if this was a PS5 game. Kojima would have made the trigger harder to hold the heavier the package.
[1:58:05] <%GeneralSCPatton> BEST ITEM!
[1:58:06] <Blackjackal95> I feel like the confusion is intentional
[1:58:06] <AThing_> handcramps as a game mechanic

[1:58:46] <%GeneralSCPatton> NO BUT IT'S GOOD THO
[1:58:49] <+mrhandsss> they cant. it MUST be carried by hand
[1:58:49] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> LUL holding a button is shit? okay I guess
[1:58:58] <Xanestus> keep it in your hands and ride the carrier
[1:59:04] <Madbearv> man's back made of titanium
[1:59:11] <+mrhandsss> that means no backpack, no attached to suit, no carriers, no vehicles.
[1:59:18] <%Irridium> you should sort your stuff speed skeleton gives you your leg things back
[1:59:28] <%GeneralSCPatton> L3 TO BECOME SPEED
[1:59:42] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> Yeah the speed skeleton is the sickest
[1:59:46] <+Mkingston> run and jump and land like Jehuty.
[1:59:47] <+Tonku_the_Red> @woolieversus Speed skeleton gives you leg storage again.
[1:59:50] <+Javaa01> Also, jumping while sprinting LAUNCHES you
[2:00:16] <+AlexDemille> Can't wait for the speed boost into uncontrolled fall into failure. haha
[2:00:21] <+mrhandsss> btw its super worth leveling these 2 locations imo.
[2:00:24] <+Hollow_Mirage> So you can jump over ravines instead of using the Ladder?
[2:00:25] <+Mkingston> JUMP
[2:00:37] <+mrhandsss> especially the place they're going to
[2:00:40] <+sulek6666> @WoolieVersus Put down the cargo and sprint jump
[2:00:47] <MarshMan301> tomatoKnife tomatoRat
[2:00:48] <AThing_> weather report: SNAILS
[2:00:55] <ArtooKilledYou> Become jumpman Mario jumpman!
[2:01:03] <+Javaa01> You can outrun BTs with this
[2:01:03] <Graxe_> Well then
[2:01:06] <+Hollow_Mirage> Snails!? Don’t touch them you’ll turn into one!!!
[2:01:07] <+Mkingston> when you land you land in an anime way
[2:01:26] <+mrhandsss> u could possibly sprint past the BTs. MIGHT work
[2:01:39] <Xanestus> you could also just go around these BTs
[2:01:52] <Milo_Oda> has woolie used a double jump yet?
[2:02:00] <+Tonku_the_Red> Don't bother fighting them. Just stealth it.
[2:02:04] <ArtooKilledYou> Now let’s all jump up super high!
[2:02:07] <+Hollow_Mirage> but... can the speed Skeleton let you run fast enough to not get catched by your own Gay thoughts?
[2:02:17] <+mrhandsss> do NOT drop that on an uneven surface
[2:02:24] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> Better man than me.... I went super around them haha
[2:02:25] <+Tonku_the_Red> @artookilledyou High up in the sky!
[2:02:29] <+Mkingston> caught
[2:02:30] <+Hollow_Mirage> *Free Abridged Reference not trying to be coy
[2:02:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> YOU CAN OUTRUN THEM!
[2:02:47] <%Irridium> I just stockpiled a ton of grenades and went in a straight line, killing all in my path LUL
[2:03:15] <+mrhandsss> the problem is they're on a hill. they put the container down to throw grenades, its probably gonna roll
[2:03:38] <+Javaa01> You don't need to worry about killing anything here, you can outrun the BTs
[2:03:45] <+linSP> when youre on 1 hp
[2:03:50] <+Javaa01> So long as you have battery, that is
[2:03:59] <Milo_Oda> he doesnt wanna risk tripping if he runs
[2:04:08] <+Mkingston> no you're not
[2:04:11] <honeyman18> Until you need POWER
[2:04:25] <+mrhandsss> i think they could run while holding both triggers and they'd be fine unless they run into something
[2:04:30] <Aydarkzero> he doesn't get old he's just crippled
[2:04:38] <ArtooKilledYou> He wants speed skeleton but doesn’t SPEED???
[2:04:41] <Sol_Install> he get's crippled
[2:04:42] <AxelCezar> he kicks a wall
[2:04:47] <KamiiFlow> Rises
[2:04:51] <chronoxgp> dark kngiht rises

[2:04:52] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Dark Knight Stries Back LUL
[2:05:00] <AThing_> Woolie was about to say Dark Knight Strikes Back
[2:05:07] <AThing_> ahh someone else got that one
[2:05:08] <%Irridium> bt's are gone you can sprint now
[2:05:10] <+gwanzan> Bale Batman needs braces until his back is broken and he gets prison back adjustment and he is perfectly fine
[2:05:10] <Xanestus> he'd be fine if he sprints while holding the hourglass, long as he doesnt fall into another hole
[2:05:12] <+heyitsdenzel_> Return of the Dark Knight
[2:05:19] <Overloard> heath leather
[2:05:21] <Prevot> dark knight rises is garbo

[2:05:37] <honeyman18> The comics have batman get replaced by a religious nut after bane snaps his spine
[2:05:41] <+mrhandsss> there's a 2 part animated version of that dark knight comic
[2:05:52] <+gwanzan> 80s Frank Miller is one of the all-time great comics guys
[2:05:57] <black_pariah> frank miller is a crazy islamophobe
[2:06:03] <+Hollow_Mirage> Do you mean Azrael Honeyman?

[2:06:40] <derap41> The range is like 500 meter isn't crap
[2:07:01] <+Javaa01> Though most of the exo skeleton tech available right now is used in industrial applications
[2:07:18] <+Javaa01> Because it's still a bit too bulky and power hungry for long time on the field use
[2:07:33] <chronoxgp> jus use the human skeletons they're much cheaper
[2:07:34] <%GeneralSCPatton> JUST OUTRUN THEM WITH SPEED MODE!
[2:07:51] <black_pariah> this entire next scene needed an editor
[2:08:01] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> here we go

[2:14:23] <dukenux> Ho boy, were at the junk wife part, eh?
[2:14:26] <+mrhandsss> biggest problem with this scene isnt the accent it takes her so long to say what can be summed up as "my mom is a bitch. she lied and said my BF is dead but clearly he isn't. take me to him plz"
[2:14:28] <honeyman18> Halfway through these scenes bruh
[2:14:29] <Lionkevinson> Hot spring?

[2:14:40] <dukenux> Sam is the kind of guy that wears his own name on a hat.
[2:14:40] <+sulek6666> @WoolieVersus take her to the hotspring
[2:14:54] <%xpakeo> spam woolie to take her to the hot spring
[2:14:55] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> like Minh LUL

[2:15:15] <%Lion_kun> But Woolie that woman is clearly white.
[2:15:21] <+ConLin_Arts_> Japanese-American probably?
[2:15:23] <dukenux> How a person speaking in their own accent is racist LUL
[2:15:24] <+Tonku_the_Red> If someone doesn't have an accent then they are silent. Everyone who speaks has an accent of some kind.
[2:15:37] <ArtooKilledYou> Ocelot meowing is an accent
[2:15:49] <Xanestus> get another 36 likes from your bot LUL

[2:16:14] <+GarbageNirvana> dweee dweee do dwee~
[2:16:16] <dukenux> its also really patronising "Sorry, but you sound like a caricature of yourself"
[2:16:17] <Graxe_> Mei Ling's Chinese American, born and grew up in America.
[2:16:17] <%SanguineQuest> Question: was the Metal Gear Solid voice actor actually chinese, or was it someone AFFECTING a stereotypical chinese accent?
[2:16:21] <%SanguineQuest> Because that's important
[2:16:22] <Prevot> mei ling sounds better with the accent, but she's american
[2:16:25] <derap41> Its just shots blod

[2:16:44] <+patriotrenegade> BLOOD GUN
[2:16:44] <Aydarkzero> NOT A CHARGE SHOT
[2:16:45] <Ashenik1> @patriotrenegade why it doesnt suprise me LUL
[2:16:57] <cohnjena13> Sir Darlington Woolsworth the 44th
[2:17:03] <+Mkingston> with your blood
[2:17:06] <+Razputin217> BLUD
[2:17:09] <+ConLin_Arts_> I rarely used guns except for the tie up gun, Bloodnades all the way for me
[2:17:09] <+emperordread> In the future, bullet calibre is measured in ml
[2:17:10] <Prevot> YOU'RE A SQUID NOW
[2:17:12] <+DeeJayOkay> This gives "Bloody Tears" a whole new meaning
[2:17:18] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> It's more like a a paintball, lol
[2:17:19] <Infinit_Phoenix> people have said I have an accent since I was a kid. I came to the conclusion I just talk funny since I've lived in one town my whole life and we dont have noticeable accents around here
[2:17:22] <Grahfvitnir> Now is Sam a Woomy or Weemo guy?
[2:17:26] <+linSP> fully charged shots are the only way to go
[2:17:39] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> a high calibur blood coated paintball lol
[2:17:44] <dukenux> Try to not go full auto
[2:17:44] <derap41> can't kill ghosts
[2:17:47] <Nested_Dreams> Sam is def a Weemo guy
[2:17:47] <+Superbro64> how is the splatoon 2 online scene about now I wonder?
[2:17:48] <+mrhandsss> non lethal just means doesnt kill people
[2:17:50] <+ConLin_Arts_> It can't kill people
[2:17:53] <%GeneralSCPatton> IT KILLS GHOSTS BUT NOT PEOPLE
[2:17:55] <+ConLin_Arts_> so it is safe to use!
[2:18:00] <+Superbro64> didnt support end a couple years ago?
[2:18:01] <Xanestus> BTs aren't people
[2:18:03] <serpenttucker> It will kill BT's but not humans
[2:18:04] <lindy94> Dudes i'm scottish i am an accent
[2:18:05] <dukenux> Aren't all guns in this non-lethal?
[2:18:09] <+mrhandsss> no
[2:18:10] <%ECRead> non lethal on MULES lethal on BT
[2:18:11] <+ConLin_Arts_> WOOOLIE
[2:18:14] <+ConLin_Arts_> no
[2:18:17] <pi_in_the_sci> IT KILLS BTS
[2:18:18] <Overloard> you can kill what's already dead, non-lethal means don't kill people
[2:18:19] <+Tonku_the_Red> Lethal only applies to humans. Any blood weapons can kill BTs.
[2:18:21] <+TheIronMoose> bts dont really die
[2:18:24] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I never thought I had an accent, until I moved and everyone was going "hey, are you from (the correct place)?" all the time
[2:18:26] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> You can kill bts but not people
[2:18:32] <dukenux> BTs are ghost demons so they dont count
[2:18:33] <+2DSuperiority> Blind them with your blood like DIO
[2:18:35] <derap41> Woolie has no idea the amount of blasting he will be making
[2:18:36] <+ConLin_Arts_> non-letal = not adding more BTs
[2:18:37] <+patriotrenegade> Woolie doesn’t read chat
[2:18:40] <black_pariah> Reading Comprehension
[2:18:45] <+heyitsdenzel_> no one ever really dies
[2:18:50] <fruit_pie_the_magician> It WILL kill them, but not in one shot like the nades
[2:18:53] <cohnjena13> How much crap can load on our Norman Reedus?
[2:18:54] <Xanestus> everything in the world is exactly the same
[2:19:01] <+AlexDemille> He read chat!
[2:19:03] <+AlexDemille> Lol
[2:19:05] <%GeneralSCPatton> GOOD JOB REGGIE!
[2:19:07] <%Irridium> I think fully charged it will kill a BT
[2:19:07] <Overloard> people who matter LUL
[2:19:11] <%ECRead> CORRECT. LETHAL TO BTs NONLETHAL TO MULES
[2:19:11] <%xpakeo> thank you reggie
[2:19:14] <%cache_22> Reggie is the real MVP.
[2:19:15] <+Tonku_the_Red> Does Reggie read the chat though?
[2:19:18] <+ConLin_Arts_> Killing means more BTs
[2:19:21] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> Full charge headshot will kill a bt
[2:19:22] <+AlexDemille> It isn't a great wording though.
[2:19:22] <honeyman18> It's just a blood soaker with a tight nozzle basically
[2:19:24] <+patriotrenegade> Reggie reads chat.
[2:19:41] <pi_in_the_sci> Woolie should recycle all of his stuff
[2:19:41] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:19:52] <%xpakeo> they both read chat, they just dont acknowledge it most the time
[2:20:07] <%Z_Guy> Z_Guy subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:20:13] <%SanguineQuest> So I went and checked my own question: Mei Ling's voice actress is a Vietnamese American, so yeah, I would say having her put on a stereotypical chinese accent to play a chinese character is at least somewhat racist. THere's a big difference between that and having a Japanese person speak english with a Japanese accent.
[2:20:17] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> They don't acknowledge because this is technically a recording session for youtube.
[2:20:45] <StarlitStunner> So I started blastin’ vineSchut rooSlain vineSchut_HF
[2:20:50] <%Z_Guy> woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM
[2:20:51] <+mrhandsss> not first
[2:20:56] <derap41> safe the hot spring for later
[2:20:56] <%xpakeo> @Meta_Yoroitoshi woolie has said on the podcast before he reads chat sometimes but doesnt acknowledge it aloud, making silent corrections when needed
[2:20:59] <+Mkingston> Time for the Hot Springs episode!

[2:22:19] <+AlexDemille> When Gorrister just shoves his step-mother into his pocket.
[2:22:19] <%xpakeo> @Meta_Yoroitoshi my bad, i misunderstood what you said
[2:22:24] <Prevot> @sanguinequest who does mei lings voice doesnt really matter,but the fact she was born and raised in an english speaking country does
[2:22:30] <+mrhandsss> its gonna make them drop half their stuff
[2:22:32] <chronoxgp> wrap her up in a carpet
[2:22:32] <+TheIronMoose> I have no legs and I must strand
[2:22:40] <+Mkingston> A traditional escort mission would have been much worse

[2:26:37] <+PeanutJesus> Cargo is the new hole
[2:26:38] <Prevot> this is SUCH a naruto filler episode
[2:26:39] <+charleslatte> Woolie almost had a three-way
[2:26:41] <+Razputin217> Cargo doesn't TALK
[2:26:41] <+Mkingston> mala morgan
[2:26:42] <EileenTheCrowe> Lady please stop talking, I'm trying to work here
[2:26:42] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1207129758447939586?s=19
[2:26:44] <+GarbageNirvana> What happens if you call out during this whole thing anyway
[2:26:47] <dukenux> i dont know if her talking makes this less or more weird
[2:26:51] <+AlexDemille> I really hate it when you come from a location to pick someone up and they won't shut up about how to get back to where you just came from.
[2:26:53] <serpenttucker> Japanese pretty lady kojima had a crush on
[2:26:57] <derap41> For real try peeing on her Woolie

[2:27:10] <AThing_> "careful" lady we're trying
[2:27:13] <+Hollow_Mirage> Would it be possible to drown her in the hot spring?
[2:27:16] <dukenux> Tar pits are a good place to dispose bodies, but WHY would she know that?
[2:27:24] <+Hollow_Mirage> Hmmmmmmmm....
[2:27:25] <Xanestus> you know why
[2:27:26] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> She's just sewing the seeds Woolz LUL
[2:27:32] <+mrhandsss> i mean in this world if ANYONE dies, u need to dispose the bodies like that
[2:27:36] <+Mkingston> @Hollow_Mirage no
[2:27:37] <+mrhandsss> so it makes some sense
[2:27:38] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> pls dont moan
[2:27:46] <AxelCezar> you will regret not having the unique interactions in the hot spring
[2:27:47] <%ChoculaUltra> keep on keeping on.
[2:27:52] <+TheIronMoose> if she talks too much hit her with the container spray
[2:27:57] <Louie_Salmon> How many likes can you give in the stopped time?
[2:27:57] <kev_acmal> woolie’s actually gonna deliver this lady huh
[2:27:58] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Pls do the hotspring
[2:27:59] <dukenux> i dont think tar pit would do the job though. in this world it would still end in the event
[2:28:00] <+mrhandsss> GIVE UP
[2:28:01] <+Mkingston> so meta "give up"
[2:28:02] <dukenux> aw this song
[2:28:02] <serpenttucker> You aren't doing your job if you don't give everyone 500 likes
[2:28:05] <NotHereToStream> back down
[2:28:07] <+heyitsdenzel_> Today was a good day. Sam didn't even have to use an AK.
[2:28:08] <AThing_> get those content id matches
[2:28:08] <dukenux> GIVE UP WOOLIE
[2:28:08] <+AlexDemille> So she's in the bag because she has to be protected. So if you get to the hot springs, do you just dunk the whole bag in the water?
[2:28:10] <+Superbro64> smash that MF like button
[2:28:11] <+linSP> ohhh so thats why cities near tar pits dont have cremation centers
[2:28:17] <%Irridium> HOT SPRINGS
[2:28:22] <Prevot> delivering a mail order bride
[2:28:23] <dukenux> Just accept this is your life now
[2:28:24] <+linSP> they just toss it in the hole
[2:28:26] <derap41> woolieCHAN
[2:28:27] <%GeneralSCPatton> @dukenux The tar pits seem to be bottomless and/or magical
[2:28:36] <dukenux> Delivering mail order brides on mars
[2:28:37] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> LUL
[2:28:49] <Lionkevinson> The feels
[2:28:52] <+Mkingston> Outlaw Star
[2:28:53] <tegas_> Better OST then DMC btw.
[2:28:55] <+PeanutJesus> Can't wait for Death Stranding 2: Electric Boogaloo
[2:28:56] <+AlexDemille> This is Mars?
[2:28:56] <AxelCezar> MULTIPASS
[2:28:57] <+Mkingston> or Firefly
[2:28:59] <dukenux> Leeloo Dallas mooltipass
[2:29:02] <+charleslatte> Kojima developed an addiction to sad hipster music, didn’t he?
[2:29:02] <Xanestus> the tar pits are pure void goop and probably digest human bodies before they can necrotize
[2:29:03] <yukichocomilk> yes this is mars
[2:29:06] <Prevot> or gurren lagann kinda
[2:29:07] <%Lion_kun> The Transporter
[2:29:17] <chronoxgp> gurren lagann ripped off outlaw star lol
[2:29:17] <+AlexDemille> OH! I thought this was a weird post-apoc earth
[2:29:17] <dukenux> Transporter, yea
[2:29:20] <AxelCezar> too soon...
[2:29:21] <kev_acmal> @generalscpatton probably some loose ass symbolism about timefall and bts and necrotizing being about accelerated time and tar pits being big time stop zones where nothing decays
[2:29:25] <+Mkingston> Mail order brides
[2:29:27] <black_pariah> girl in a box is a well worn trope
[2:29:30] <serpenttucker> Tar will no joke tear your body apart if you are in their long enough
[2:29:33] <%SanguineQuest> @PeanutJesus God willing we'll all meet against in Death Stranding 2: The Search for More Money
[2:29:34] <Prevot> and the opening of Xenoblade 2
[2:29:35] <StarlitStunner> rooComfy stripComfy
[2:29:37] <+mrhandsss> it even was an asian girl in transporter
[2:29:41] <+Hollow_Mirage> Personally when I think of Anime Packages I think about Letter Bee
[2:29:41] <Meta_Yoroitoshi> @AlexDemille you're not wrong
[2:29:47] <dukenux> It looks like Matt Damon is stranded nearby
[2:29:52] <kev_acmal> @serpenttucker if you struggle
[2:29:53] <+Hollow_Mirage> The main character was a Package
[2:29:55] <+Maldoree> girl in box trope of the inclosed raised nobilehouse girl
[2:30:04] <+linSP> is this what texas looks like in kojimas head, like MARS
[2:30:04] <+AlexDemille> Ok, I'm not crazy. I'm just getting midled.
[2:30:09] <silfa144> SourPls
[2:30:10] <+GarbageNirvana> So I can only guess the dirt around here is red because there's high iron content in the soil which is being rusted out by the timefall
[2:30:36] <Prevot> remember to talk cause the music might be cut
[2:30:40] <+TheIronMoose> this is just the first level of this type of delivery, later you have to deliver a 400lb neet that won't stop talking about his pre stranding fanfics
[2:30:40] <+Mkingston> a catapult would be faster
[2:30:44] <serpenttucker> Like a quad?
[2:30:47] <+mrhandsss> and here's soemthing worth knowing. there's no area in the game that's not connected to the network that you can't connect. all areas can be connected, some just arent plot related
[2:30:51] <+PeanutJesus> Ya gotta get Xavier's little floating wheelchair from days of future past, man
[2:30:51] <AThing_> this is how kojima meant it to be

[2:49:10] <+Mkingston> Why does bacteria dying not cause a void out? Do animals cause void outs? Doesn't that mean everyone is vegetarian?
[2:49:20] <Infinit_Phoenix> no
[2:49:22] <blaggablag> Arguably all terrain skeleton is overall better but not until later.
[2:49:30] <dukenux> only people cause voidouts.
[2:49:31] <serpenttucker> @Mkingston single-cell and plants apparently don't count
[2:49:31] <HyperBomb21> thre is a large area later on where you wont use the speed skeleton for obviosu reasons
[2:49:47] <+PeanutJesus> It has to be a person because it's the homo playus
[2:49:54] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> Thats what the "most of the game" part is for lol
[2:49:57] <+Mkingston> @serpenttucker that's good because anti-biotics
[2:50:02] <Graxe_> Remember that souls exist and seem to be a crucial about BTs and Voidouts occurring
[2:50:11] <Nested_Dreams> @mkingston Voidouts happen when a BT touches a living being of the same species, and currently only humans are becoming BT
[2:50:13] <+Cuon_Alpinus> dinosaurs confirmed sentient
[2:50:29] <+PeanutJesus> We need more dinosaur games
[2:50:52] <Prevot> how do you think the Dino's went extinct? DinoBTs
[2:50:59] <+Mkingston> I just remembered there were birds at the start of the game which answered my questions
[2:51:05] <Nomad94> it's important to note that timefall may damage containers, but never the cargo contained within. Just makes it more vulnerable.
[2:51:07] <+linSP> what explains the boss bts looking like animals
[2:51:09] <+bread_assassin> Spray isn't so rare that you have to conserve uses.
[2:51:15] <+PeanutJesus> Timefall wiped out the dinosaurs
[2:51:23] <%GeneralSCPatton> @nomad94 If the container fails, then it leaks through
[2:51:26] <blaggablag> I thought Voidouts were the result of small ammounts of anti matter contained in BTs coming in touch with organic matter?
[2:51:27] <Infinit_Phoenix> it wasn't a meteor those big lizards got voided
[2:51:38] <Nomad94> @GeneralSCPatton Then all ya gotta do is not trip furNase
[2:51:40] <Prevot> can timefall melt steel beams?
[2:51:45] <dukenux> with all the ridiculous product placement in this
[2:51:48] <serpenttucker> @Nomad94 I learned that fact doing that last delivery in the game. You know which one
[2:51:54] <dukenux> im surprised this isnt AXE brand spray
[2:51:58] <+mrhandsss> u can do that whenever and even if u do it, more will spawn
[2:52:15] <%GeneralSCPatton> @blaggablag It's analogous to that, but has to do with living and dead souls interacting I think
[2:52:37] <+Tonku_the_Red> @serpenttucker That last delivery was so frickin stressful. . .
[2:52:39] <+mrhandsss> void out = antimatter coming into contact with matter
[2:52:50] <+mrhandsss> so yeah when a catcher BT eats a living being
[2:53:07] <serpenttucker> @Tonku_the_Red also really subverts expectations
[2:53:08] <Nomad94> @WoolieVersus It takes like 50 hours of gameplay for timefall to completely brick a structure, so it's fine
[2:53:28] <AThing_> So there's eventually going to be a point where all the structures are destroyed because the online isn't as active?
[2:53:37] <+linSP> the antimatter is inside a bt so they gotta eat a person to cause a voidout
[2:53:40] <+mrhandsss> wonder if they'll stumble across the game developer guy in the middle of that camp
[2:53:56] <+Mkingston> Imagine playing this offline
[2:54:00] <Infinit_Phoenix> @athing_ theoretically yes
[2:54:01] <+TheIronMoose> I want to play as a mule. Jack other players to stockpile sick loot
[2:54:04] <blaggablag> @linSP Apparently it's only inside the big ones since it only triggers when they eat you.
[2:54:09] <Outdated_Leon> game developer guy? you mean Kojima?
[2:54:12] <+mrhandsss> dude gives u a backpack cover which i found pretty useful
[2:54:22] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> @Mkingston I did for a bit lol
[2:54:26] <Nomad94> @Outdated_Leon he's referring to the Collector.
[2:54:28] <serpenttucker> @AThing_ I don't think your structures in YOUR world deteriorate in real time when not playing, and each world you are connected with has your structures deteriorate at their own rate
[2:54:31] <+mrhandsss> no. some guy that works for famitsu iirc
[2:54:32] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @Outdated_Leon no hes like a different guy and hes under the cliffs
[2:54:39] <+Mkingston> run jump the gap
[2:54:44] <dukenux> LUL
[2:54:52] <blaggablag> Double jump the gap!
[2:54:53] <AThing_> @serpenttucker Oh I see so it's a time limit inside of each player's game, not some global time limit for every game
[2:54:53] <Xanestus> fall in the hole again woolz
[2:54:54] <Nomad94> time to jiump the gap and horribly miss Kappa
[2:55:01] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> This Bladerunner

[2:55:04] <Blackjackal95> the OST for this game is great
[2:55:21] <gade177> Oh yeah the most is great.
[2:55:25] <serpenttucker> @AThing_ yes, though some of that time limit is artificial as the game will dramatically alter the state of everything you build later.
[2:55:27] <gade177> ost
[2:55:27] <OuterHades> most PogChamp
[2:55:28] <HyperBomb21> audio design in general is really good in Death Stranding

[2:55:30] <OuterHades> Kappa
[2:55:36] <+Mkingston> running jump
[2:55:40] <Xanestus> double jump woolie, do it
[2:55:40] <blaggablag> Time to get kinky
[2:55:47] <OuterHades> bondage Keepo
[2:56:05] <+mrhandsss> think the only prepper u didnt need to do that for who isnt plot related was first prepper cause he just had a mission on his terminal for anyone to pick up
[2:56:12] <+Mkingston> take everyone to the hot springs
[2:56:12] <Outdated_Leon> @Nomad94 @gyro_gogo_zeppeli Ah I see. He's talking about the fat glasses guy.
[2:56:37] <HyperBomb21> atpCap
[2:56:37] <blaggablag> I want a PC mod of this where the incapacitated MULEs end up in the ground with an elaborate Shibari rope pattern.

[2:56:44] <+mrhandsss> sam? sam?! SAM
[2:56:45] <HyperBomb21> @WoolieVersus you can use Cargo as a melee weapon and instantly KO a MULE

[2:56:48] <%GeneralSCPatton> YEYEYE BIG PUNISH

[2:56:58] <%Lion_kun> Mules are bitches
[2:57:00] <serpenttucker> @WoolieVersus you can throw packages by doing to swing the package and letting go of the respective trigger mid-swing
[2:57:00] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL
[2:57:01] <Outdated_Leon> oops got KOed
[2:57:07] <Infinit_Phoenix> tackling insta breaks blocks also try chucking uneeded shit back at mules for ez openings.
[2:57:09] <+GarbageNirvana> Go get that shit
[2:57:10] <+Mkingston> I've never seen this
[2:57:15] <GamerWorlock> well duh
[2:57:20] <Prevot> now go pick up your souls
[2:57:21] <+linSP> lost your shit
[2:57:24] <Enyoyable> MR SHAKEDOWN
[2:57:24] <black_pariah> why would you use the strand when there was 5 guys right next to you
[2:57:25] <derap41> yah got jacked
[2:57:26] <+Superbro64> s t r i p p e d
[2:57:27] <%GeneralSCPatton> And you said that you don't lose consciousness...
[2:57:31] <OldManDeckardCain> wait, you can lose to mules after getting bola LUL
[2:57:36] <black_pariah> just run at that point
[2:57:49] <zaitje> thankfully we still got the trucker hat
[2:57:49] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> I've never seen this either and I beat the game lol. That's crazy.
[2:57:50] <Xanestus> he wanted to flex, AGAIN, and got put in his place, AGAIN
[2:57:53] <bevyrage> he had nowhere to run
[2:57:57] <%cache_22> Will he jump over the gaps now?
[2:58:03] <+GarbageNirvana> What's really rough is when that happens when you're on a timed mission
[2:58:06] <blaggablag> Some time passes, which means time critical missions would be lost if you are on a timer.
[2:58:06] <HyperBomb21> you have no Cargo so MULEs dont chase you now
[2:58:12] <+GarbageNirvana> You lose like 20 minutes to that
[2:58:16] <derap41> Remember how David Cage said a "game over" was a failure of the game designer? This is what he meant
[2:58:17] <serpenttucker> @cache_22 He doesn't have the speed skeleton on
[2:58:22] <Nomad94> MULE scanners thankfully don't work if you don't carry anything
[2:58:26] <+Mkingston> the mistake was not running and jumping the gap when you had the chance
[2:58:30] <Graxe_> You can trust that ladder
[2:58:34] <Graxe_> It's fine
[2:58:37] <+CHIENFOULEWOUF> you can jump over the gap while sprinting
[2:58:42] <Xanestus> MULEs still attack if you go in their territory, but they dont chase too far
[2:58:44] <HyperBomb21> But Woolie was dragging a floaty carrier and thould have fallen
[2:58:50] <+linSP> getting knocked out makes time pass, eroding structures and losing on mission rating

[3:02:22] <blaggablag> I think you can pee on the cryptobiotes to replenish them?
[3:02:28] <HyperBomb21> yep, I can see where woolie tripped too
[3:02:37] <HyperBomb21> If he used the scanner, that ledge would have had a red X on it
[3:02:39] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> 'night @Mkingston
[3:02:52] <AThing_> night
[3:02:59] <laguerrilha> night night
[3:03:14] <SpellCatty> Goodnight Mkin
[3:03:36] <+zombiespaceman_> yo whats good
[3:03:42] <+mrhandsss> the thing with peeing and cryptobiotes is if enough peopel do it and make enough of those mushrooms, it becomes a spawn point for them. that's it
[3:04:11] <AThing_> holy shit they got a mad max truck for ganking?
[3:04:20] <laguerrilha> steal the truck?
[3:04:20] <Nomad94> also peeing on BTs scares them away
[3:04:25] <AThing_> I didn't even realize there were enemies in this game besides the ghosts
[3:04:37] <derap41> Parry you casual
[3:04:41] <+zombiespaceman_> this game is full of surprises
[3:04:44] <+ConLin_Arts_> counter with the strand
[3:04:45] <HyperBomb21> You can throw packages at them
[3:04:48] <+mrhandsss> they about to get KO'd again
[3:04:49] <+ConLin_Arts_> silly boi
[3:04:54] <Nomad94> Why parry when you can just dodge, then attack?
[3:04:56] <+zombiespaceman_> ruh roh raggy

[3:05:06] <Nomad94> Woolie, come on man
[3:05:11] <Aydarkzero> bleh
[3:05:11] <+sulek6666> Remember when Woolie said that Mules are complete non issue like 30 minutes ago?
[3:05:14] <Infinit_Phoenix> for a speed skeleton
[3:05:15] <+ConLin_Arts_> WutFace
[3:05:28] <+ConLin_Arts_> I have never seen this
[3:05:28] <+mrhandsss> to be fair, this is the first time i've ever seen someone struggle with them
[3:05:29] <Aydarkzero> i've never seen this before
[3:05:29] <HyperBomb21> @sulek6666 atpCap
[3:05:48] <+zombiespaceman_> you can do it woolie i believe in ya man
[3:05:51] <blaggablag> Even the ones that are on heavy goon armor aren't that much of a challenge
[3:06:01] <ne0bunny> just use bola
[3:06:26] <%GeneralSCPatton> This is why you invoke the power of Bola God
[3:06:30] <+ConLin_Arts_> the strand makes the Mule encounters tvilial with the counter
[3:06:32] <+mrhandsss> well endgame guys arent technically MULEs but yeah, i didnt have trouble on the normal difficulty at least
[3:07:18] <blaggablag> Or just headshot bola everyone
[3:07:26] <+mrhandsss> they gonna crash a motorcycle
[3:07:33] <blaggablag> OR incap them over water and watch them float away
[3:07:39] <AThing_> So storywise what are the mules? If it isn't a spoiler for something woolie hasn't gotten to yet
[3:07:50] <+linSP> mules dont let you parry for free if theres two or more
[3:07:50] <AThing_> This motherfucker has a unit 01 bike
[3:07:51] <Infinit_Phoenix> i beat it on hard. hes being overcareful. just go ham and utilize all the combat functions instead of just punch and shoot
[3:07:51] <HyperBomb21> i really wouldnt trust a motorcycle for jumping if I were you
[3:07:53] <+mrhandsss> mules are people who are ADDICTED to delivering packages
[3:08:02] <blaggablag> they crave that likecin
[3:08:08] <+mrhandsss> to the point they will do whatever it takes to steal them from others
[3:08:11] <AThing_> @mrhandsss excuse me? They're addicted to the gig economy
[3:08:23] <HyperBomb21> economy of likes
[3:08:25] <Infinit_Phoenix> even hemetics can be a distraction
[3:08:28] <KasiCrafter> Place your bets for Woolie INSTANTLY eating it on the first bike jump.
[3:08:39] <HyperBomb21> This is gonna end badly
[3:08:41] <+mrhandsss> they steal packages from others to deliver them themselves. and yes, then they get the likes
[3:08:48] <+linSP> someone tell him about the charge for crowds
[3:08:50] <blaggablag> Bikes get obnoxious air tho
[3:08:53] <KasiCrafter> Literal karma farming.
[3:08:59] <HyperBomb21> and obnoxiously bad landing
[3:09:04] <AThing_> You know I might need to play this at some point because the idea of people stealing packages to deliver them is hilarious
[3:09:05] <NotHereToStream> mules are redditors
[3:09:24] <+mrhandsss> mules are basically what would happen if this game had actual multiplayer

[3:33:45] <+sulek6666> @WoolieVersus You can fit 2 if you rotate it sideways
[3:33:48] <NotHereToStream> important, grenade pouch holds 5 grenades
[3:33:53] <serpenttucker> @WoolieVersus just saying right now, you are gonna be able to get 2 battery packs on there, but you need to roate them to get them on there
[3:33:59] <Kghaleon> Load yourself up with a hundred grenade pouches
[3:34:04] <+linSP> attache case time
[3:34:08] <derap41> No need to carry boxes of grenades anymore
[3:34:46] <Kghaleon> Waste of space
[3:35:10] <derap41> yeah
[3:35:14] <Kghaleon> Generators are so cheap
[3:35:30] <derap41> You've got a gun now no need for nades
[3:35:30] <+ConLin_Arts_> LUL
[3:35:33] <+mrhandsss> honestly yeah extra grenades arent needed. now, when they get to blood pouches and the stabilizer? those might be interesting for them
[3:35:43] <+ConLin_Arts_> I always used Grenades
[3:35:56] <+ConLin_Arts_> they where stronk
[3:36:00] <Kghaleon> Grenade mist makes guns better
[3:36:14] <serpenttucker> Yeah...lots of beer...
[3:36:21] <brunoberserk> woolie you can change backpack color
[3:36:25] <+mrhandsss> you have the beer until you make sam go on a drunken rampage in his room. it never happened for me though
[3:36:30] <+paladinstarbuster> mount
[3:36:42] <+ConLin_Arts_> I only ever used guns during the Cliff parts
[3:36:48] <serpenttucker> Batteries just extends your battery guage
[3:36:50] <%GeneralSCPatton> You have upgraded away the product placement
[3:37:01] <Kalinflip> Stun grenades ftw man
[3:37:04] <derap41> You can make a MAGA hat
[3:37:04] <+mrhandsss> i used the nonlethal guns all the time once i got them
[3:37:29] <+ConLin_Arts_> oh yeah I used them on the Terror Mules
[3:37:35] <+linSP> were still in chapter 3 no spoil
[3:37:45] <Kghaleon> Defensive truck can hold a shit load of stuff
[3:38:04] <+mrhandsss> oh yeah these trucks hold WAAAAY more than mule trucks

[3:39:50] <Kalinflip> LMAOO
[3:39:58] <$SilverRoddo> Woah oh oh, i’m in love with Judas, Juuu-da-us! 🎶
[3:40:24] <+mrhandsss> not gonna ram them huh
[3:40:29] <derap41> Just make sure not to run over MULES with the truck
[3:40:37] <+xenoriddley36> Order of importance for games @WoolieVersus Graphics, music, story, gameplay,
[3:40:38] <+mrhandsss> why not? it doesnt kill them
[3:40:48] <+xenoriddley36> which is number 1?
[3:41:00] <peachy996> How it doesn't kill them is bizarre
[3:41:05] <$SilverRoddo> Because Norman’s in Judas / Lady Gaga video
[3:41:18] <peachy996> Worse than hitting people with the batmobile
[3:41:23] <+locutus_of_the_porg> did anyone ever not burn a body? what actually happens?
[3:41:26] <Kghaleon> Max accidentally killed some Mules in his stream
[3:41:37] <Kalinflip> @locutus_of_the_porg Void out happens but like off screen
[3:41:39] <+Javaa01> The MULEs have drank their milk, their bones are strong enough to take a few vehicle collisions
[3:41:45] <+xenoriddley36> @locutus_of_the_porg doesn't it cause the giant explosion from the beginning?
[3:41:46] <+mrhandsss> if u dont burn a body, after a lot of real world time the body turns into a BT
[3:41:48] <chronoxgp> same i had to get rid of them
[3:41:57] <Kalinflip> GGS
[3:42:10] <Kghaleon> Take *everything*
[3:42:11] <+locutus_of_the_porg> I heard thats what happens but I read people saying nothing happened when they killed mules
[3:42:20] <chronoxgp> i got a truck and filled it with bodies
[3:42:20] <+mrhandsss> and then if any NPCs are in the area they will get eaten and it creates a voidout where u have to reload the save. otherwise u can kill the bt that spawns
[3:42:22] <+ConLin_Arts_> I avoided killing the mules
[3:42:24] <+xenoriddley36> @locutus_of_the_porg it's simple. Mules aren't people
[3:42:45] <+locutus_of_the_porg> has woolie been delivering the elder his pills?
[3:42:52] <NotHereToStream> voidout will occur if you kill mules, it takes a shit ton of time before it happens
[3:43:00] <+Javaa01> Oh hey, it's that Bola Gun you lost like 40 minutes ago
[3:43:03] <Kghaleon> Take it all.
[3:43:09] <+mrhandsss> voidouts only occur if someone gets eaten by a BT
[3:43:29] <+mrhandsss> it CAN happen if u leave a dead body in an area and do nothing, but its not guaranteed.
[3:43:35] <chronoxgp> yes the living matter hits the anti-matter and makes a bomb
[3:44:05] <chronoxgp> it'd be cool if half were bt's half exploded
[3:44:08] <+locutus_of_the_porg> the intro when the voidout happens was crazy charlsJolly
[3:44:48] <$SilverRoddo> Does Reggie get Time and a Half today?
[3:44:56] <Kghaleon> he find the hidden shelter?
[3:44:58] <+Javaa01> The truck has a jump BTW
[3:45:10] <Belutima> I want a mod for a cybertruck skin woopsISee
[3:45:11] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:45:20] <+mrhandsss> they have not found the game guy yet
[3:45:21] <chronoxgp> the video gamer is off a drop
[3:45:39] <+mrhandsss> somehow, they havent picked up lost cargo for him yet
[3:45:42] <Prevot> looks like we gonna have to JUUUMP

[3:47:01] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> Lets go boys HAHAHA
[3:47:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> THIS IS WHY YOU SCAN
[3:47:06] <OldManDeckardCain> Woolie trying super hard to beat Pat's record LUL
[3:47:06] <BeijiWeng> trip was the worst mechanic on Smash brawl atpRtsd
[3:47:07] <AxelCezar> projChins projChins projRIP
[3:47:13] <katocrimson> merry belated Xmas!
[3:47:14] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> I came back in at the perfect time haha
[3:47:20] <+experimental_jet> Odra who?
[3:47:21] <+Javaa01> Scan, and look out for the yellow markings on the ground, you trip on those
[3:47:26] <$SilverRoddo> Running has BlessRNG
[3:47:27] <+PapaGravestone> first time catching the stream live and i see that bumble. Mega PogChamp
[3:47:50] <+linSP> scan before jumping
[3:47:58] <+mrhandsss> im just amazed they havent found the prepper here yet with how much time they spent in this spot
[3:48:31] <NotHereToStream> if you have a ton of cargo, you will fuck up
[3:48:31] <+Javaa01> You can trust it, but you have to plan things out FIRST
[3:48:34] <derap41> Where are all the bridges
[3:48:39] <katocrimson> is he looking 4 collector?
[3:48:48] <HyperBomb21> You cna trust the odradek to give you agood path where you wont trip
[3:48:48] <Prevot> red equals dead
[3:48:52] <+mrhandsss> no they dont know the collector exists yet
[3:48:55] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> Jumpings fine you just have to be careful
[3:49:00] <%QaizerArt> Nah @katocrimson he probably doesn't know Collector is around here.
[3:49:03] <+sulek6666> @WoolieVersus maybe dont try to jump with 100kg on your back
[3:49:03] <%jepupu> That spot obviously needs a bridge
[3:49:30] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> Also having a till stack of cargo doesn't help sprinting either haha
[3:49:35] <derap41> Or use a ladder
[3:49:45] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> ^
[3:49:53] <+mrhandsss> part of that area is offline because they havent found him yet which means they wont see bridges
[3:49:55] <+Mekhet09> There would probably be a bridge if he had the collector.
[3:49:56] <+Mekhet09> Does he?
[3:50:03] <derap41> I love how dirt roads slowly form where people have traveled
[3:50:17] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> Nice
[3:50:18] <derap41> That's not a truck is a city SUV
[3:50:23] <+Javaa01> You can't topple the trucks
[3:50:51] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> uhhhhh... I wouldn't say you can't LUL
[3:51:13] <+mrhandsss> im just wondering if they'll ever visit elder again
[3:51:27] <+mrhandsss> and if they do, will it have been a long time since their last visit
[3:51:48] <ne0bunny> think he might have off camera
[3:51:53] <%Codex5050> Codex5050 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[3:51:54] <+Javaa01> Not on the ground, if launch yourself off a jump while your truck is sideways, then yeah, but that should be pretty obvious
[3:52:07] <%jimmytwofeet> you skip THE PRESIDENT?
[3:52:09] <Kileerkrullxiii> So I saw simmons in a watchmojo video

[3:57:01] <Aydarkzero> @ChoculaUltra thanks
[3:57:01] <OldManDeckardCain> "That time I was reincarnated as Guile who can do sonic booms in the air"
[3:57:05] <%mayorrev> I think its popular choice
[3:57:20] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> It's just pick whatever song/character you like more
[3:57:45] <ne0bunny> thats why you saw that weird floating ladder you removed
[3:58:15] <%ChoculaUltra> which means if you play Death Stranding like 6 months to a year from now, the entire experience could be so much more different without all the player made structures/help. Crazy to think about.
[3:58:16] <%GeneralSCPatton> That path was completely undriveable before. There's a flat path now.
[3:58:36] <+CarlosEoM> I do wanna check that out

[4:05:08] <SpellCatty> I saw it posted somewhere, maaaan
[4:05:09] <chronoxgp> ghost wire and dying light 2 would've killed it
[4:05:14] <SomersaultJustice> why don't they just turn it off?
[4:05:16] <SpellCatty> it looked so cool
[4:05:36] <DaRoosta89> no good christian would dare.
[4:05:40] <%ChoculaUltra> one does not simply turn off Jesus
[4:05:48] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Yeah, that ending thing with the reedus in it was fucking rendered real time, and some modder broke out of the house and managed to float around it, its fucking great
[4:06:14] <chronoxgp> he had to make the model float or it'd fall thorugh the level, there was no collision for the ground

[0:21:39] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Oh damn there are a lot of tutorials
[0:21:43] <+vixenpunch> I’m a big fan of the “keep working on our one game” genre that shovel knight, no mans sky, and this fall into
[0:21:43] <+Gamefriendly> anyone else think the volume mixing is off, the game seems louder. or is it just me?
[0:21:51] <PinkieTheEerie> nah thats right
[0:22:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's fine cause these two can get loud and are perfect
[0:22:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> especially when reggie get's blown up cause he's reggie
[0:22:20] <+Gamefriendly> thats true
[0:22:22] <KSDM> PLAY CUSTOM CHARACTERS Kreygasm
[0:22:28] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Short press for hops for universal overhe- no wait
[0:22:38] <thunderrex> yea they are real quiet
[0:22:42] <+Dimfish> theres so many ridiculous custom characters in this game
[0:22:57] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Like Minecraft Steve
[0:23:00] <+vixenpunch> Short hopping is op in vania-likes
[0:23:19] <+Dimfish> sans hitler and minecraft steve
[0:23:20] <+vixenpunch> It’s basically like higher a tier of gameplay
[0:23:30] <Djinnazz> Damn right
[0:23:30] <@akuda_bar> text noise so satisfying, like prprprprp
[0:23:44] <+vixenpunch> Like a higher*

[0:24:17] <SchlongKongEduardo> nice
[0:24:19] <+vixenpunch> FRAME COUNTS IN TUTORIALS?
[0:24:22] <+vixenpunch> BLESSED
[0:24:30] <%gatorafan> I believe I've heard Custom Characters are disabled on Online so I'm not sure how worth it'd be for them to check them out.
[0:24:46] <%gatorafan> Especially considering there is another game tonight.
[0:24:56] <KSDM> they can play together.
[0:24:58] <NebulaPurple> ye but you can turn them on in Lobbies
[0:25:04] <+UnprecedentedStudios> ^
[0:25:07] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Another game? What is it?
[0:25:09] <NebulaPurple> cause both players need the same files
[0:25:16] <%gatorafan> Oh, they will probably run lobbies.
[0:25:18] <+UnprecedentedStudios> Although both characters will have to have the same characters
[0:25:27] <xiccy> you can use custom characters online as long as you both have the characters
[0:25:32] <+UnprecedentedStudios> both players*
[0:25:36] <+vixenpunch> Frame data tutorials is the way
[0:25:38] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Also, how do these custom characters work? Are they like mods?
[0:25:44] <DiamondStormOwO> yup
[0:25:45] <NebulaPurple> steam workshop support
[0:25:48] <DiamondStormOwO> workshop characters
[0:25:52] <+UnprecedentedStudios> Yeah the tutorial can be kinda unforgiving
[0:25:54] <NebulaPurple> literally click the subscribe button and they're added
[0:25:57] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Oh damn thats interesting
[0:26:05] <+vixenpunch> Those who are most confused are the loudest
[0:26:08] <+vixenpunch> Like pat
[0:26:09] <DiamondStormOwO> you have to turn on the open beta for the workshop tho
[0:26:14] <%gatorafan> Workshop is super convenient when implemented right.
[0:26:20] <@akuda_bar> woolieWUT_SG
[0:26:25] <KSDM> ksdmSmug
[0:26:29] <@akuda_bar> that looks... decent

[0:27:16] <ClairenMain> do a wavedash back jab please
[0:27:24] <NebulaPurple> ye but it'l still a beta so it's kinda buggy
[0:27:42] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Now do a 56 hit combo ending with Vergil's level 3
[0:27:46] <%Taglog7> Big wombo
[0:27:59] <ClairenMain> disable auto run please
[0:28:03] <+vixenpunch> “Alright y’all wanna learn how to do a fuckin infinite”
[0:28:03] <NebulaPurple> ftilt is the hardest attack in this game
[0:28:03] <ClairenMain> :^)

[0:29:02] <guille_st> there's no grabs or throws
[0:29:18] <ClairenMain> buy clairen
[0:29:19] <+Dimfish> @taglog7 there is wavedashing in this
[0:29:21] <KSDM> You can assign tilts to a button
[0:29:24] <+rooooooooooot> can you map tilts to the stick in this game?
[0:29:28] <+rooooooooooot> oh
[0:29:29] <%Taglog7> Nice
[0:29:30] <+Fortrify_Streager> Just takes a lot of practice to get tilts down
[0:29:35] <Axmos> you can map tilts to stick yeah
[0:29:39] <KSDM> and or a stick
[0:29:41] <thunderhog> And this is why they made the C stick
[0:29:42] <rcgama> im with you there
[0:29:46] <+rooooooooooot> tilt stick ludwigU
[0:29:46] <DiamondStormOwO> yes, you can map tilts to the CStick
[0:29:46] <Axmos> also you can buffer it during anything
[0:29:47] <thunderhog> Well not really but you know
[0:29:50] <NebulaPurple> tilts to right stick is optimal
[0:29:51] <%Taglog7> All i hear is boomer boomer boomer
[0:29:51] <+vixenpunch> Woolie is speaking my language on tilts
[0:29:56] <SomersaultJustice> woolie, try to remember the basics of cqc
[0:30:03] <Djinnazz> Melaa had it yah
[0:30:11] <Djinnazz> Melee*
[0:30:12] <@akuda_bar> yeah I don't love tilts
[0:30:18] <+vixenpunch> That’s my exact problem with action game melee combos
[0:30:20] <Axmos> meelee did not have tilt stick what
[0:30:20] <$megamonmon123> woolie treat it like a girl, soft and gentle
[0:30:20] <@akuda_bar> especially up tilt
[0:30:27] <+rooooooooooot> smash attacks triPog
[0:30:33] <+vixenpunch> Where it requires a pause where you can get hit
[0:30:39] <NebulaPurple> upt tilt is fine if you turn off tap jump, which this game ahs turned off by default iirc
[0:30:58] <DiamondStormOwO> or just use a tilt stick, it's much better
[0:31:00] <%Taglog7> PogChamp Dakus
[0:31:00] <@akuda_bar> I'd have to rewire my brain to tap jump
[0:31:03] <+rooooooooooot> thats a brawl thing
[0:31:05] <+Wool> DACUS
[0:31:07] <+rooooooooooot> dacus
[0:31:11] <+Wool> Dash Attack Cancel Up Smash

[0:32:24] <+rooooooooooot> down smashes are ok
[0:32:36] <+rooooooooooot> theres better options for most characters tho
[0:32:38] <+vixenpunch> Exceptions are made

[0:38:30] <%rytyoung> hey y'all
[0:38:31] <NebulaPurple> and xbone version is outdated, but it's probably getting updated
[0:38:37] <Milo_Oda> reggie knows about marios secret tech PogChamp
[0:38:40] <@akuda_bar> I wanna get it on switch so I can force people to play something other than smash at parties lol
[0:38:46] <DiamondStormOwO> lmao
[0:38:55] <Axmos> After wall jump you can use up special again
[0:38:57] <+rooooooooooot> di triPog
[0:38:58] <+Dimfish> but you'll miss out on all the mods then
[0:39:07] <LoneFonte> they're working on a "definitive edition" before launching on switch
[0:39:36] <NebulaPurple> maffs
[0:39:43] <+UnprecedentedStudios> MAFF
[0:39:45] <TigerClaws12> quick maffs
[0:39:48] <rcgama> quick mahts!
[0:39:48] <Nevereatcars> welcome to intermediate defense bitches grab your protractors
[0:39:54] <TheBrunoZone> It's kinda wholesome that they're working on a version for the switch of all the consoles
[0:39:56] <+UnprecedentedStudios> LUL
[0:40:00] <+UnprecedentedStudios> Thanks cars
[0:40:04] <%Taglog7> But that's good
[0:40:12] <CirclesForever> hey this is furry smash bros
[0:40:20] <NebulaPurple> DI out is for escaping combos, Di in for surviving
[0:40:22] <ZakosDryiakk> Grab the oldest notebook you can and use it to make a rivals setup
[0:40:41] <Zuzu_Pachulia> no smash 4 vectoring
[0:40:44] <ZakosDryiakk> Its high likely it’ll work well enough
[0:40:49] <+Gamefriendly> this is melee di tho right? smash ult is different?
[0:40:49] <PFlare> Yeah, so no Smash style DI.
[0:40:51] <+rooooooooooot> that was 4 for a bit i think?
[0:40:51] <DiamondStormOwO> workshop has Sans, just a reminder
[0:40:58] <Nevereatcars> this is melee di
[0:41:28] <@akuda_bar> sans undertale?!
[0:41:28] <NebulaPurple> kinda like KI, you're still playing the game while you're getting hit
[0:41:29] <Nevereatcars> but you can aerial drift left and right during hitstun, AFTER you've inputted DI'd during hitPAUSE
[0:41:30] <jubejube56> geez I forgot how fun kragg is
[0:41:42] <Nevereatcars> which is better than melee di
[0:42:02] <Nevereatcars> where you can't drift until you get full control of your character back
[0:42:22] <mrblack499> what is this?
[0:42:32] <Solidnick18> seems solid
[0:42:42] <NebulaPurple> literally the best platform fighter, gameplay wise
[0:42:42] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:42:47] <+miyoles> does this game have online 4 player multiplayer yet?
[0:42:53] <DiamondStormOwO> kinda
[0:42:56] <NebulaPurple> it's in the works
[0:42:56] <+UnprecedentedStudios> I love how it showed Kragg F Smash even though it's far from a kill move now LUL
[0:43:01] <DiamondStormOwO> the new netcode is on beta yet
[0:43:12] <thunderhog> yeah it's machup knowledge
[0:43:27] <thunderhog> But usualy something sending you Upwards is pretty telegraphed
[0:43:35] <Mothman742> isnt one of the dlc characters ori?
[0:43:37] <+miyoles> poopy
[0:43:43] <+rooooooooooot> triPog
[0:43:44] <LoneFonte> @Mothman742 ye
[0:43:45] <DiamondStormOwO> yes
[0:43:52] <Mothman742> litty titty
[0:43:55] <+jiggy_snipe> lol Reggie
[0:44:03] <+BigBruthaThunda> streetwise Reggie
[0:44:10] <rcgama> Reggie knows the secret moves
[0:44:13] <+rooooooooooot> 5Head
[0:44:13] <NebulaPurple> yo Ori's in the game, really want to play it now
[0:44:16] <+Gamefriendly> how is smash ults di different? that one works where you want to di opposite from your angle right?
[0:44:20] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> Reggie found tech
[0:44:24] <%Irridium> I mean, they can't win if they can't knock you out
[0:44:34] <+UnprecedentedStudios> tsbBigbrain
[0:44:36] <+attackofthesage> yeah
[0:44:38] <masterfire23> galaxy brain reggie
[0:44:50] <TheBrunoZone> Oh, yeah, in case some of you might not know: Characters like Ori and Shovel Knight are playable
[0:44:53] <NebulaPurple> if you get hit with no way to survive, a purple effect appears
[0:45:07] <+UnprecedentedStudios> Generally
[0:45:09] <PFlare> Smash Ult you can DI in a lot more directions and you can do something like hold forward or something, right?
[0:45:15] <Man_in_the_Red> anyone else see that Blazblue X Guilty Gear is real Kappa
[0:45:55] <thunderhog> I mean when you're in low damage people are gonna try to land combos to rack damage
[0:46:00] <Nevereatcars> get air juggled tho!
[0:46:12] <thunderhog> once you're high enough THEN you're gonna start getting those kill moves
[0:46:17] <Mothman742> !uptime
[0:46:18] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 46 minutes and 19 seconds
[0:46:21] <thunderhog> or combos into kill moves
[0:46:35] <DiamondStormOwO> Ori be like
[0:46:38] <thunderhog> So you wanna just drop out the light hits so the heavy shit dont land
[0:46:44] <PFlare> WE TECH THOSE.
[0:47:15] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> moms spagetti
[0:47:16] <Zuzu_Pachulia> TECH DE JESUS
[0:47:22] <+rooooooooooot> man smash will never have this shit
[0:47:34] <Kristoffers> 20 second
[0:47:46] <DiamondStormOwO> 1/3 of a secong actually
[0:47:47] <Milo_Oda> god i cant believe i somehow intuited this shit as a child with 64 and melee. my adult mind is like shit this is fucking complicated NotLikeThis
[0:47:51] <+UnprecedentedStudios> 20 frames not 20 seconds
[0:48:01] <Axmos> in this game you dont actually reset it in this game
[0:48:04] <+rooooooooooot> this would be a dogshit game if you were out for 20 seconds
[0:48:16] <Axmos> if you mash its 20 frames on 20 frames locked
[0:48:26] <Milo_Oda> hyrule temple? you mean weenie hut jr. Kappa
[0:48:56] <thunderhog> Thisis ALSO a thing in smash. and the reason why Snakes stage in smash was really dumb
[0:48:59] <thunderhog> cause you just never die
[0:49:08] <DSD24> I like listening to this music
[0:49:15] <@akuda_bar> I can't tech you guys
[0:49:20] <+pkmamsters> wall teching is how you survive hyrule fight club
[0:49:22] <@akuda_bar> I'm a scrub woolieWUT_SG
[0:49:29] <PFlare> @pkmamsters aMEN.
[0:49:29] <NebulaPurple> you get used to it
[0:49:33] <KSDM> AMSA Kreygasm
[0:49:34] <+rooooooooooot> boomer reggie
[0:49:35] <Milo_Oda> does this game have amsa teching
[0:49:37] <NebulaPurple> 20 frames is pretty generous if you don't mash
[0:49:44] <+Gamefriendly> i feel like woolie is leaqrning more about melee then when he did that thing with Kage
[0:49:44] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:49:53] <+jiggy_snipe> yea Rivals of Aether has a nice OST

[0:50:49] <korsablade> @Ghostfaceninja53534 Zelda's
[0:50:50] <ManlyMcBeefington> hammer hits have sweet spots I think in melee
[0:50:56] <+UnprecedentedStudios> Zelda fair and bair have sweetspots
[0:51:24] <+rooooooooooot> smash has spheres
[0:51:24] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> puff sleep is the classic tho
[0:51:26] <Goldenwolf98> If you ever want to learn sweet spots use Marth LUL
[0:51:31] <Prevot> hitballs
[0:51:36] <@Solidus_113> Marth tippers
[0:51:40] <Kristoffers> sweet dot
[0:51:44] <+UnprecedentedStudios> Yeah there's hit spheres, boxes, and another shape of hitboxes in this game @WoolieVersus
[0:51:44] <thunderhog> @WoolieVersus In laymans terms, most meatys tend to give you sours
[0:51:45] <Mothman742> @thatjuantoo idk man i got it for free but i didnt get the dlc characters

[0:52:46] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> just promove it
[0:52:47] <thatjuantoo> @Mothman742 Is joke, the DLC characters must be bought when purchasing fighting game.
[0:52:52] <TheBrunoZone> No, shut up. DO COMBO
[0:52:53] <FuqBoiSlim> do...combo....
[0:53:19] <Milo_Oda> hit this pikachu is you can Kapppa
[0:53:23] <+combowarriorx> Hello everyone.
[0:53:24] <animailistic> YEAHHH BOI ITS RIVALS TYME
[0:53:37] <Mothman742> @thatjuantoo ah ok, figured but had to be sure LUL
[0:53:45] <animailistic> Reggie about to turn against smash as it was foretold
[0:53:51] <+rooooooooooot> up tilt woolz
[0:53:54] <DSD24> Does the Lion guy have that wolf forward smash?
[0:54:00] <KSDM> yes
[0:54:00] <thunderhog> And woolie's mind is slowly getting blown
[0:54:00] <+Gamefriendly> woolies face LUL he doesnt want this
[0:54:03] <thatjuantoo> @Mothman742 It's the law :p
[0:54:07] <Kalcom> what is woolie doing
[0:54:10] <animailistic> @DSD24 no but it loks similar
[0:54:26] <DSD24> @animailistic Ok cause it does look familiar
[0:54:32] <Goldenwolf98> He hates it LUL
[0:54:34] <ChrisAlgoo> gonna be a furry but only with this lion in particular
[0:54:46] <Mothman742> another thing thats cool about this game is the custom colors option
[0:55:02] <DSD24> tutorials need good music
[0:55:13] <Zrehael> Oh god, he's really gonna hate this tutorial. XD
[0:55:14] <TheBrunoZone> Every single game should have a custom color creator
[0:55:17] <DSD24> This game has good music
[0:55:18] <animailistic> It's a power palm but wolf's is smaller and one hit, Zett has a vortex first hit at the start of the attack
[0:55:27] <Solidnick18> that's my ledge
[0:55:31] <ChrisAlgoo> The CVS2 custom color creator was really fun
[0:55:31] <+rooooooooooot> @WoolieVersus if you do a quarter circle like this ^ 7 > you are forced to walk
[0:55:35] <DSD24> They are dead first Woolie
[0:55:35] <Goldenwolf98> NAH BE COOL THO

[0:55:46] <+jiggy_snipe> naw Woolie you gotta style on dem foos
[0:55:51] <PFlare> It's HARD to get used to, but you have to have faith in your ability to recover.
[0:55:57] <Djinnazz> Naw, he don't get a fall death, you because of ME.
[0:56:07] <%Irridium> what if i wanna play little mac
[0:56:11] <ChrisAlgoo> THIS TUTORIAL OWNS
[0:56:13] <Djinnazz> WTF, that's just FALCO!
[0:56:16] <Goldenwolf98> @WoolieVersus Think of it like killing with taunts in 3rd Strike LUL
[0:56:20] <animailistic> Woolz just has rookie nerves, as he practices recoveries he will get better at learning edgeguards
[0:56:33] <+Gamefriendly> LUL this is great
[0:56:36] <+arcturusblade> this is lowkey the hardest part of the tutorial
[0:56:39] <+jiggy_snipe> lol Woolie

[0:58:08] <Goldenwolf98> Can we all agree Rivals has a great tutorial
[0:58:16] <Mothman742> orcane tutorials NotLikeThis
[0:58:29] <+rooooooooooot> that jab is massive
[0:58:36] <NebulaPurple> Rivals teaches you the gist of most platform fighters, it's great
[0:58:40] <animailistic> Yeah Rivals has auuhhhhhhh great everything
[0:58:43] <Axmos> lol "jab is massive"
[0:59:02] <DSD24> Don't be tilted at these tilts
[0:59:18] <%gatorafan> music is pretty cool SourPls
[0:59:27] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> not gonna lie, this is my first time seeing this game and its way deeper than i thought it'd be
[0:59:29] <+combowarriorx> I enjoy this game more than Smash Ultimate.
[0:59:35] <+rooooooooooot> man i wish ultimate didnt get rid of jab cancels
[0:59:38] <Axmos> do the character specific ones
[0:59:43] <+Wool> jab jab powerdunk
[0:59:50] <animailistic> This game is basically the better smash, since 2012
[0:59:53] <@Solidus_113> wave dash?
[0:59:58] <DiamondStormOwO> wave dash
[1:00:04] <animailistic> @Solidus_113 yes dude
[1:00:11] <Milo_Oda> lemme see them multi shines
[1:00:25] <+pkmamsters> dash dance
[1:00:32] <animailistic> Multishines are not a thing unless you install 100% accurate Fox
[1:00:40] <JumboMan214> Yooo
[1:00:45] <JumboMan214> Hellom Reggie and Woolz
[1:00:59] <@akuda_bar> I spaced out and now we're installing foxes and doing initial d
[1:01:02] <JumboMan214> Finally a game I can play lol
[1:01:05] <JumboMan214> hello chat
[1:01:16] <zayasu> HahaCat
[1:01:17] <animailistic> Zetter's shine is more of a linking tool for setting fire to opponents
[1:01:24] <+12StarvingOrphans> 12StarvingOrphans subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:01:25] <animailistic> so you can end in smash attacks
[1:01:32] <Milo_Oda> doesnt zeter have some melee esqu shine stuff
[1:01:35] <DiamondStormOwO> basically, yeah
[1:01:38] <+Wool> bruh just mash it
[1:01:41] <DiamondStormOwO> but Zetter's shine can meteor too
[1:01:46] <%gatorafan> daedra1DrunkTibs
[1:01:51] <+BallerSwagBro9k> RAAIIIIIIIID
[1:01:55] <animailistic> @Milo_Oda yes, but its pretty risky and not as abusive
[1:01:56] <Goldenwolf98> LUL
[1:01:56] <shadepman> bruh
[1:01:57] <+jonblu10> SPEED
[1:02:06] <Datwiseguy> this is dashblocking all over again
[1:02:17] <+jiggy_snipe> lol
[1:02:19] <+Wool> at least he doesn't need to do this 3 times in a row
[1:02:20] <%jinking79> woolieFUN
[1:02:22] <NebulaPurple> zetter shine is radial
[1:02:26] <animailistic> Its almost always safer to use air attacks
[1:02:28] <NebulaPurple> it hits you away from the center
[1:02:33] <+jiggy_snipe> now Reggie continue
[1:02:34] <animailistic> ^^^^
[1:02:34] <KnivesEve> hey yall
[1:02:47] <+Dr_DangerPhD> dash dancing is basically a running shimmy right?
[1:02:53] <animailistic> Yes?
[1:02:55] <eiightbiitt> apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab
[1:02:57] <+pkmamsters> don't try to dash dance literally 1 pixel from it
[1:02:59] <+ArAechFGC> oh no, woolie is gonna smell now
[1:03:12] <animailistic> since there are no grabs its not the same but fundimentally yes
[1:03:13] <Goldenwolf98> WE MELEE NOW BOIS Kappa
[1:03:23] <NebulaPurple> wavedashing in this game is so good
[1:03:27] <@akuda_bar> the smell of a melee player
[1:03:37] <MetalDeerS0LID> StinkyCheese
[1:03:37] <NebulaPurple> you canliterally just press jump plus dodge with the stick in neutral, and it just works
[1:03:40] <NebulaPurple> IT JUST WORKS
[1:03:44] <DiamondStormOwO> > you can wavedash on keyboard
[1:03:44] <shadepman> monkaS
[1:03:48] <+FadingFrost> this game is amazing. once they added steam workshop it got even better so now its basically mugen
[1:03:48] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:03:55] <+pkmamsters> i believe Rivals also just has a dedicated short hop button. so wave dashing is as easy as possible
[1:03:57] <animailistic> Wavelands separate low and med levels of play
[1:04:08] <NebulaPurple> you can set a dedicated shorthop and fullhop button
[1:04:21] <Saltmeisterr> sup gamers
[1:04:22] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Engwithan_Elder_God subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months, currently on a 12 month streak! 
[1:04:24] <Kalcom> woolie prejumps every day
[1:04:27] <Milo_Oda> peach float?
[1:04:28] <+miyoles> thats a fun workout
[1:04:39] <DiamondStormOwO> no Peach float sadly
[1:04:55] <animailistic> Med and High levels of play are separated by movement options out of wavelands
[1:04:57] <JumboMan214> @WoolieVersus you can also just press it together
[1:05:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> You can set a shorthop/Longhop button making wavedashing super easy
[1:05:01] <JumboMan214> its fine
[1:05:08] <Axmos> you can technically hit them at the same time
[1:05:19] <Solidnick18> dah what?
[1:05:20] <thunderhog> LUL
[1:05:21] <DiamondStormOwO> med and high levels of play are separated by how many mix ups you have
[1:05:24] <+combowarriorx> LUL
[1:05:27] <+vixenpunch> Imagine kicking your legs so hard that the air around your feet compresses enough that you use it as a platform to jump again
[1:05:29] <+pkmamsters> Kingslanding
[1:05:30] <+vixenpunch> Thanks one piece
[1:05:30] <LoneFonte> LUL

[1:26:48] <Goldenwolf98> Woolie already tying to become a shovel knight main LUL
[1:26:48] <+rooooooooooot> SourPls

[1:27:05] <@akuda_bar> falco?
[1:27:06] <animailistic> isnt there a competitive bounty still open for winning a major with shovel knight
[1:27:06] <spardanwarrior> Literally an Ora Ora rush

[1:27:15] <TheBrunoZone> Aint
[1:27:17] <TheBrunoZone> Falco
[1:27:28] <thunderhog> oh god they kepted the gold armor
[1:27:30] <@akuda_bar> wombo combo!
[1:27:33] <DiamondStormOwO> Wrastor is very different
[1:27:33] <Nevereatcars> that's jigglymarth
[1:27:37] <+rooooooooooot> buy the style armor triPog
[1:27:43] <Axmos> fishing off the edge makes the most money
[1:27:48] <Oxybe> Fish off the edge!
[1:27:51] <NebulaPurple> Wrastor is literally made to be a collage of Melee top tiers
[1:27:54] <animailistic> fishing ledge makes bannnnnk
[1:27:55] <NebulaPurple> he's Captain Falcopuff
[1:27:59] <+UnprecedentedStudios> There is no edge on this map LUL
[1:28:00] <NebulaPurple> with a side of Marth
[1:28:01] <Axmos> fishing off the edge makes money
[1:28:05] <ZakosDryiakk> Wheres the edge on aether rock wall tho
[1:28:12] <TheBrunoZone> Also I love how every character has sort of a quirky style that makes them different from each other
[1:28:13] <+jonblu10> When the pillars break
[1:28:16] <sleepy_pixels> im desisive to the fact that that may not be the character called falco
[1:28:16] <Oxybe> pit?
[1:28:17] <zamzoph> Woolie is tricking Reggie into winning Kappa
[1:28:18] <Lionkevinson> is this just indie smash?
[1:28:20] <Liquirill> glad i tuned in, never warmed up to smash, but this ms-dos style hits a spot for me.
[1:28:21] <Axle13j> that shit is brutal lol
[1:28:22] <AMaidIndeed> 1337
[1:28:26] <Kristoffers> yeah
[1:28:30] <thunderhog> FISH COMBOS
[1:28:34] <GigaBowserRoA> HEARD YOU TALKIN SHIT
[1:28:34] <Nevereatcars> @TheBrunoZone they all have some kind of stage-affecting mechanic
[1:28:36] <NebulaPurple> if Smash is Street Fighter, this'd be more like GG/BB
[1:28:37] <Kristoffers> reel it in
[1:28:38] <Nevereatcars> NO
[1:28:41] <Kristoffers> GON MAIN
[1:28:41] <+Grayhammatter> fishing for a fight brother?
[1:28:42] <Solidnick18> shovel knight got some stuff
[1:28:45] <NebulaPurple> with each character having their gimmicks
[1:28:50] <Nevereatcars> GIGA LEAVE ME ALONE
[1:28:54] <%yeknomlive> I saw a lot of goofy community characters how does that worj
[1:28:54] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Shovel Knights animation is beautiful
[1:28:59] <GigaBowserRoA> YOU FOOL I EXIST EVERYWHERE
[1:29:03] <Saltmeisterr> yeah the characters gameplay wish are very GG
[1:29:05] <+UnprecedentedStudios> GIGA
[1:29:05] <ZakosDryiakk> LOL
[1:29:22] <+combowarriorx> I like calling this game the Skullgirls of platform fighters.
[1:29:27] <Djinnazz> AGREED.
[1:29:29] <animailistic> I would say smash is more anime just because the toolkits are gibberish
[1:29:30] <Nevereatcars> 100
[1:29:30] <+combowarriorx> Agreed Woolie
[1:29:34] <BloodiaMK2> the gold armor is when you wanna flex on your boy
[1:29:36] <Solidnick18> i agree
[1:29:39] <Kalcom> didn't even use it lul
[1:29:39] <Louie_Salmon> But blade strangers did give him the voice.
[1:29:40] <NebulaPurple> Skullgirls is actually a great comparison
[1:29:41] <Kristoffers> He's an alrightassist trophy
[1:29:42] <thunderhog> Shovel knight is the worst guest chracter in shovel knight
[1:29:43] <Axle13j> teh-ken
[1:29:47] <animailistic> This game has very nitpicked perfect kits by comparison
[1:29:51] <+UnprecedentedStudios> OH NO
[1:29:53] <thunderhog> King knight is the real chracter of shovel knight
[1:29:57] <Vortigon> Hyper Light Furry
[1:29:57] <+LucentWulf> YO CLAIREN LETS GO
[1:30:00] <TheBrunoZone> If you love smash then you shouldn't sleep on this game. That might be a terrible mistake.
[1:30:02] <%yeknomlive> shovel armor in bloodstained was pretty fun
[1:30:03] <Goldenwolf98> @Louie_Salmon yeah but Blade Strangers is kinda bad LUL
[1:30:05] <DiamondStormOwO> eugh, Clairen

[1:30:16] <TigerClaws12> the clap sound LUL
[1:30:20] <NebulaPurple> they give you a visual for tipper how clever is that?
[1:30:20] <jubejube56> Lol it is so bad that I only just realized that was a Hyper Light Drifter reference
[1:30:24] <Nekros4442> Has Woolie commented on the SF5 netcode fix mod that got released on PC?
[1:30:26] <@Menitta> I'm not a fan of Hyper light drifter
[1:30:29] <xiccy> shes one of 2 characters with a command grab
[1:30:45] <+Wool> Menitta isn't a fan of many things
[1:30:45] <Axmos> i think she was pre hyper light drifter tbh
[1:30:56] <@Menitta> No, the character in this game
[1:30:56] <@akuda_bar> @menitta never talk to me
[1:30:59] <+zeebeebdj> how you liking the game?
[1:31:01] <Nevereatcars> this clairen player's got f l o w
[1:31:06] <BackwardCap> If you hit with the different colored tip of Clairen's Sword it will paralyze them.

[1:31:09] <amychibi> Dear Woolie i really love your content. i wanted to ask you. have played recently darkest dungeon with the latest dlc they released?
[1:31:12] <@Menitta> I love the actual game of Hyper light drifter
[1:31:16] <NebulaPurple> doesn't matter it's the same synthwave color scheme and aesthetic either wat
[1:31:18] <NebulaPurple> way*
[1:31:21] <@akuda_bar> oh ok. you're spared
[1:31:25] <JumboMan214> Clairen is frustrating to fight against

[1:31:49] <NebulaPurple> cheeks*
[1:32:02] <@Menitta> @Wool yes thats what I said. Clearly
[1:32:04] <animailistic> Clairien is probably the easiest character to play, but the hardest to win with
[1:32:09] <+zeebeebdj> @axmos zeebeeZeebWink

[1:34:21] <BloodiaMK2> Coqui?
[1:34:24] <Kristoffers> this frog is siiiick
[1:34:40] <+jonblu10> lol he's barking
[1:34:41] <animailistic> Ranno used to be broken, but now hes alright
[1:34:42] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Sexy fish man?
[1:34:43] <Milo_Oda> what the fuck am i looking at
[1:34:45] <Goldenwolf98> Mash regular attack after Up b
[1:34:51] <DiamondStormOwO> Ranno is cooler Sheik I'd say
[1:34:53] <animailistic> the game is pretty 5-5 these days
[1:34:55] <+UnprecedentedStudios> @WoolieVersus You have follow ups from Up B.
[1:34:56] <Saltmeisterr> up b is a multi attack
[1:34:57] <BackwardCap> You can hold Ranno's up-b to do a spin attack or press down b to dive kick
[1:34:58] <@Menitta> I can easily see how Ranno was broken
[1:34:59] <@akuda_bar> Pokemon battle
[1:35:04] <+zeebeebdj> ^
[1:35:12] <thunderhog> A bit of sheik, a bit of greninja, and some sick as bubbles
[1:35:20] <@akuda_bar> these sprites are gorgeous
[1:35:20] <%gatorafan> I'd catch these two
[1:35:21] <BloodiaMK2> Disco Ninja Frog
[1:35:24] <DiamondStormOwO> you don't hold UpB, you press the normal butto
[1:35:26] <DiamondStormOwO> n
[1:35:26] <Admiral_PopnFresh> is the bubble for command grab set ups or something?
[1:35:32] <BloodiaMK2> oh wait, wrong game
[1:35:39] <DiamondStormOwO> the bubble is for comboes
[1:35:40] <+zeebeebdj> bubble has a lot of uses
[1:35:40] <animailistic> The bubble lets you do bigger combos
[1:35:42] <DiamondStormOwO> and stuff
[1:35:49] <+rooooooooooot> bubble looks to get you a free hit
[1:35:49] <animailistic> and set up big spikes
[1:35:50] <Nevereatcars> @WoolieVersus do ranno up b mash light attack
[1:35:55] <+zeebeebdj> u can also use dair on it to recover or stall
[1:35:56] <+UnprecedentedStudios> @WoolieVersus Hit basic attack after Up B
[1:36:05] <animailistic> it gets you one free hit for each toxin charge on the opponent
[1:36:25] <Nevereatcars> both characters hit basic attack after up b
[1:36:35] <GigaBowserRoA> not sylv
[1:36:38] <NebulaPurple> lol what are sylvanos mains jsut downsmash their recovery dude like close your eyes, just combo them
[1:36:43] <Nevereatcars> how does sylv bite then

[1:37:14] <NebulaPurple> I like your character, he's combo food
[1:37:15] <Axle13j> nice
[1:37:16] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:37:19] <ZakosDryiakk> Grass desync tho
[1:37:21] <NebulaPurple> when he's not zoning me
[1:37:22] <BackwardCap> You can angle Sylvano's Bair up and down
[1:37:22] <Solidnick18> even game
[1:37:27] <GigaBowserRoA> grass desync kinda hype
[1:37:31] <+arcielardor> Would you call that guy a timber-wolf?
[1:37:31] <Saltmeisterr> is there a way to check movelists in game?
[1:37:43] <animailistic> I forgot that sylvanos is the most beautiful character ever
[1:37:44] <GigaBowserRoA> there are character specific tutorials
[1:37:47] <Kalcom> you can corin with it
[1:37:51] <+Rararachan> Man, I wasn't expecting this game to be so legit

[1:38:01] <Kristoffers> Okami shit goingon
[1:38:02] <MirtosC8> look, a low tier trash character that just win with gimmicks... and sylvanos
[1:38:03] <ZakosDryiakk> ^
[1:38:04] <@Menitta> What does Ranno's down B do
[1:38:14] <NebulaPurple> ye and like 3 moves have special inputs, so you don't really need a movelist, it'd be nice tho
[1:38:16] <DiamondStormOwO> this game is almost the perfect platform fighter
[1:38:23] <NebulaPurple> Ranno DownB sets bubble
[1:38:27] <animailistic> no, it is perfect
[1:38:28] <+Rararachan> F

[1:39:40] <+UnprecedentedStudios> @WoolieVersus Hammer the ice
[1:39:41] <DiamondStormOwO> this game would be better if Ranno had an OHKO move

[1:39:45] <+zeebeebdj> lmao
[1:39:48] <GigaBowserRoA> no it wouldn't

[1:40:16] <Nevereatcars> hey everyone if you're going to Genesis 7 you can add rivals FOR FREE for about THREE MORE HOURS

[1:44:36] <Goldenwolf98> good thing you can turn off stage hazards in this game
[1:44:40] <BloodiaMK2> She reminds me of Tron Bonne
[1:44:40] <Saltmeisterr> Snek is Snake/BJ
[1:44:42] <NebulaPurple> look at that free stage control, Elli is surely broke :^)
[1:44:53] <animailistic> nebula plz
[1:44:55] <MirtosC8> Elli broken please nerf
[1:44:59] <animailistic> plz
[1:45:03] <NebulaPurple> also her missiles are pit arrows, but 100x better, broke
[1:45:04] <@Menitta> Anything slightly goof is broken
[1:45:08] <GigaBowserRoA> best part of this game is everyone is viable at a competitive level
[1:45:12] <NebulaPurple> and charged it's actually a kill move, please nerf
[1:45:13] <Saltmeisterr> Elli is super techincal
[1:45:14] <@Menitta> and should be bant
[1:45:15] <ZakosDryiakk> Kappa
[1:45:19] <MirtosC8> everyone is good
[1:45:19] <@Menitta> Kappa
[1:45:21] <+cawi> hold b when a cloud is out.
[1:45:21] <JumboMan214> For Eliana you gotta overheat to get access to regular smashes
[1:45:21] <MirtosC8> except ori
[1:45:24] <GigaBowserRoA> Everyone is busted
[1:45:25] <Saltmeisterr> but seems very fun once u get good as her
[1:45:28] <Admiral_PopnFresh> goat girl reminds me of like Pikachu x Mewtwo
[1:45:30] <animailistic> elli's skill floor is most people's skill ceiling
[1:45:31] <@Menitta> Awwwww I wanted to get Ori
[1:45:31] <BloodiaMK2> @Menitta I just noticed the Reboot sub icon PogChamp
[1:45:34] <DiamondStormOwO> Everyone is busted, yes
[1:45:50] <laserbeaming> Everyone is also very fun to play
[1:45:51] <MirtosC8> ori is the coolest character
[1:45:51] <+Wool> PogChamp
[1:45:55] <MirtosC8> so much fun to plat
[1:45:55] <BloodiaMK2> Woolie has good taste
[1:45:57] <MirtosC8> play
[1:46:06] <hamahiroyuki> the Mecha is like a fusion of the new grass starter with chestnought? pretty cool
[1:46:12] <Nevereatcars> he's got those elli plays
[1:46:14] <+arcielardor> Yare Yare
[1:46:16] <animailistic> no one is busted, all characters are less isoteric and less cluncky than smash, so it feels stronger on offense, but its a fair game
[1:46:32] <+rooooooooooot> dude i wanna drop smash for this
[1:46:32] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:46:33] <DSD24> That is Zelda's move
[1:46:34] <GigaBowserRoA> no one is busted because everyone is busted
[1:46:35] <+rooooooooooot> it looks so fun
[1:46:35] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Zelda as an up air explosion I think
[1:46:35] <Saltmeisterr> mewtwo
[1:46:38] <DiamondStormOwO> everyone is busted, so it evens it out
[1:46:43] <Solidnick18> orcane PogChamp
[1:46:44] <Nevereatcars> LET'S GO MAYPUL
[1:46:44] <Vortigon> Character design is kind of hit or miss
[1:46:46] <LoneFonte> @rooooooooooot ONE OF US
[1:46:50] <Kalcom> yes mewtwo, the one with a skirt
[1:46:51] <Nevereatcars> one of us
[1:46:52] <@Menitta> I still prefer Smash but this is a very fun game
[1:46:53] <hamahiroyuki> oh now I noticed the shymin pallate
[1:46:55] <Kristoffers> I'll say
[1:47:04] <TheBrunoZone> No one is unbalanced if every character is broken
[1:47:04] <animailistic> better design does not equal unfair
[1:47:04] <Kristoffers> but yeah
[1:47:05] <JumboMan214> I mean
[1:47:06] <Kristoffers> seems fun
[1:47:07] <+rooooooooooot> @LoneFonte dude ultimate has been pissing me off so i need something new lol
[1:47:13] <Nivrap> 'better design'
[1:47:13] <JumboMan214> this game is fun
[1:47:16] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I for got the whale has paws, I hate it
[1:47:16] <MirtosC8> after 1 month playing this game i can't play smash anymore

[1:47:32] <NebulaPurple> Hitfall shoudl be in every platform fighter
[1:47:35] <Kalcom> seed
[1:47:36] <animailistic> I beg the stream chat to drop smash for this, Ive been begging people for years
[1:47:38] <NebulaPurple> sneed
[1:47:41] <Saltmeisterr> its still just smash
[1:47:43] <+cawi> the seed has to connect
[1:47:43] <Nivrap> no, smash is fun
[1:47:43] <+UnprecedentedStudios> @WoolieVersus Seed the opponent then up be
[1:47:43] <Nevereatcars> BUY A STAGE
[1:47:45] <@Menitta> I will not.

[1:48:31] <+jonblu10> This is a great remix

[1:48:33] <+SinisterBroccoli> lol is this an ori map
[1:48:40] <ahaegotrigger> yes
[1:48:42] <MirtosC8> yeah
[1:48:43] <Nevereatcars> they're not reading chat jumbo
[1:48:43] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @GigaBowserRoA
[1:48:44] <laserbeaming> It is
[1:48:46] <+UnprecedentedStudios> He figured it out PogChamp
[1:48:46] <Kristoffers> I'd know the trailer owl anywhere
[1:48:47] <TheBrunoZone> @BloodiaMK2 See, this guy gets it.
[1:48:50] <Nevereatcars> yeah giga very rude
[1:48:56] <GigaBowserRoA> smh smh
[1:48:57] <animailistic> having to buy tower of heaven again when the game left early access was the dumbest
[1:49:00] <+UnprecedentedStudios> Heck Giga can't do his trademarked yelling
[1:49:00] <BloodiaMK2> @TheBrunoZone You know it SeemsGood
[1:49:06] <+waltzqueen> M O I S T
[1:49:08] <MirtosC8> what a bad person this giga
[1:49:16] <GigaBowserRoA> yeah what an asshole
[1:49:29] <animailistic> hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
[1:49:32] <ZakosDryiakk> Do I hear a moneymatch?
[1:49:34] <GigaBowserRoA> I bet his neck is the size of a monolith
[1:49:37] <Nevereatcars> @WoolieVersus hold to tether
[1:49:37] <ZakosDryiakk> Kappa
[1:49:39] <Nivrap> It's kinda weird to say
[1:49:47] <Nivrap> 'play this instead of ultimate'
[1:49:57] <Goldenwolf98> Whens Woolie gonna stream Ori tho?
[1:50:01] <Kristoffers> gross
[1:50:02] <Admiral_PopnFresh> goo nair
[1:50:03] <BloodiaMK2> Whip it good
[1:50:04] <Kristoffers> wet fight
[1:50:06] <Nivrap> when they're both so different, even as platform fighters
[1:50:09] <animailistic> Woolie Nuts on reggie, not experienced enough to know what to do next
[1:50:23] <+combowarriorx> I prefer this game over Smash Ultimate.
[1:50:26] <@Solidus_113> Why would you ever play an homage game when the original still exists
[1:50:28] <@Squdnate> HahaShrugRight
[1:50:33] <Admiral_PopnFresh> octo200IQ
[1:50:33] <+Grayhammatter> it AIN't SAFE
[1:50:42] <JumboMan214> Because this game is more fun
[1:50:43] <Nevereatcars> because the original dev hates us
[1:50:48] <GigaBowserRoA> because its a different game
[1:50:48] <Saltmeisterr> i also wanna see more platform fighters that aren't just smash clones
[1:50:49] <JumboMan214> lol
[1:50:54] <NebulaPurple> more balanced, more fun, mod support
[1:50:58] <Nivrap> they're completely different, you can play both
[1:51:00] <@Menitta> It reminds me of "shut up and play Warframe"
[1:51:01] <Saltmeisterr> which is why im excite for Duel Arms
[1:51:01] <Nevereatcars> @Saltmeisterr roof rage is amazing
[1:51:03] <ZakosDryiakk> Workshop
[1:51:03] <+UnprecedentedStudios> @Saltmeisterr There's alot of those out there lol
[1:51:05] <Cykron> Is this the Woolie Furry arch?
[1:51:06] <ZakosDryiakk> Period

[1:51:26] <Admiral_PopnFresh> way to Squirt it out, Reggie
[1:51:26] <+Gamefriendly> LUL
[1:51:32] <Saltmeisterr> roof rage looks cool
[1:51:33] <+Grayhammatter> oh god, they're gonna get blown up
[1:51:34] <JumboMan214> aye lets go

[1:51:36] <JumboMan214> online time
[1:51:36] <preppyposs> its not gonna be the woolie furry arc until he plays the THE DATING SIMULATOR
[1:51:38] <Cykron> Squirt to survive
[1:51:39] <preppyposs> WHICH IS REAL BTW
[1:51:40] <+Wool> squirt to survive
[1:51:40] <Saltmeisterr> but Duel Arms tho
[1:51:40] <NinjaGentleman> I still think Slap city is the best smash clone atm
[1:51:41] <masterfire23> squirt to survive Kreygasm
[1:51:47] <NebulaPurple> Lovers of aether is legit
[1:51:49] <DiamondStormOwO> > smash clone lol
[1:51:53] <BloodiaMK2> Does this game have an equivalent to Final Destination?
[1:51:53] <ModelZer0> Rivals is easier to pick up, but the neutral is comprised of a lot of 50/50s, so if you're not a fan of that other platform fighters are the way to go
[1:51:56] <animailistic> the april fools patch ah jeez
[1:51:56] <NebulaPurple> people don't know but Rivals is a spinoff of a dating sim
[1:52:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> No lobbies woolie
[1:52:03] <+UnprecedentedStudios> Online monkaS
[1:52:05] <Nivrap> I prefer neutral in Ult, I'm not a fan of melee's style
[1:52:08] <+Wool> just hope to match with us lmao
[1:52:13] <Vortigon> @NebulaPurple get outta here
[1:52:16] <BloodiaMK2> @NebulaPurple I thought that was an April Fools Joke monkaS
[1:52:17] <+cawi> I have this, but never played online.
[1:52:21] <Kalcom> how about doing workshop
[1:52:23] <NebulaPurple> it's an actual game on steam
[1:52:25] <@Squdnate> lol why play mvci, gg, sfv, t7 or any figthan, they are just rip off of SF2 the OG ResidentSleeper the fuck are people talking about
[1:52:27] <jubejube56> 528 steam friends!
[1:52:28] <+Wool> just set an obscure region
[1:52:30] <Man_in_the_Red> @nebulapurple Kappa
[1:52:30] <Saltmeisterr> no lobbies WutFace
[1:52:32] <NebulaPurple> Elliana is best girl btw
[1:52:32] <+Dimfish> workshops a lot of fun too
[1:52:39] <GigaBowserRoA> there are lobbies its only 1v1s tho
[1:52:39] <NinjaGentleman> online mode is going to be a mess
[1:52:41] <Nevereatcars> nice snipe jumbo

[1:52:58] <Man_in_the_Red> @squdnate which is a rip off of Karate Champ
[1:52:59] <Saltmeisterr> fuck em up
[1:53:03] <BloodiaMK2> @WoolieVersus Doesn't Kragg have a special palette?
[1:53:10] <Nivrap> smash people can only comprehend playing one game at a time LUL
[1:53:12] <@Squdnate> @Man_in_the_Red Exactly
[1:53:12] <%gatorafan> huh? People were saying there were lobbies a while ago when we were talking about workshop characters. daedra1DerpyTibs
[1:53:17] <+Wool> what region are y'all set to? East Coast?
[1:53:18] <Admiral_PopnFresh> clean stock fuck
[1:53:18] <+Gamefriendly> can this game do teams online? cause that'd be fun to see
[1:53:19] <GigaBowserRoA> Every character has one or more special skins
[1:53:20] <Cykron> Nice Beetle Boi
[1:53:29] <Saltmeisterr> oh no Jumbo
[1:53:37] <Solidnick18> come on jumbo

[1:53:51] <Goldenwolf98> Need more Etalus DUNKS
[1:53:56] <Cykron> Jumbo needs a new pair of shoes
[1:54:06] <GigaBowserRoA> Theres currently a netcode beta where lobbies are pretty working tho
[1:54:09] <Admiral_PopnFresh> just missed that spike, Jumbo
[1:54:14] <Saltmeisterr> Jumbo i better see an etalus dunk
[1:54:33] <+UnprecedentedStudios> @GigaBowserRoA You still have to add people as friends tho which was Woolie's gripe with it
[1:54:37] <TheBrunoZone> Smash players are a bunch of cowards that usually refuse to adapt to different games, except for M2K, Wizzrobe and Leffen
[1:54:39] <%gatorafan> k, thanks for clearing things up
[1:54:47] <+skylerpilot> are they playing on steam?
[1:54:50] <NebulaPurple> Mang0 quite likes this game iirc
[1:54:53] <GigaBowserRoA> well i mean yeah that makes sense
[1:54:53] <Nevereatcars> @skylerpilot yes
[1:54:56] <GigaBowserRoA> and yes they are on steam
[1:54:59] <Goldenwolf98> LUL

[1:55:16] <BloodiaMK2> Oh boy Slap City
[1:55:19] <TheBrunoZone> @ModelZer0 Yeah, him as well. My bad.
[1:55:30] <GigaBowserRoA> you can still hit people with taunts on spawn plat too lol
[1:55:31] <BloodiaMK2> They perfected the jank with that game
[1:55:33] <NebulaPurple> slap city looks bad but plays like a dream iirc
[1:55:39] <GigaBowserRoA> Kragg and SK can hit on the spawn platform with taunt
[1:55:51] <Cykron> Jumbo remind Woolie of why he’ll never go pro 4Head
[1:55:55] <ModelZer0> Slap city has really solid movement but the character archetypes are pretty out there
[1:56:12] <Goldenwolf98> DUNKS
[1:56:14] <BloodiaMK2> @NebulaPurple Never forget the Chain Flex
[1:56:15] <+kavonhazo> YEET

[2:03:34] <Solidnick18> that was tasty
[2:03:45] <Saltmeisterr> is the game mostly 5-5 4-6 matchups?
[2:03:51] <GigaBowserRoA> mhm mostly
[2:03:52] <Nevereatcars> we think so
[2:03:54] <Cykron> This was a Pokemon fighter before it got copywrite struck
[2:03:56] <animailistic> I would say its all 5-5
[2:04:04] <laserbeaming> The flowers keep the grass from banishing
[2:04:12] <Axmos> @Cykron thats not true?
[2:04:13] <+UnprecedentedStudios> @Saltmeisterr With the rare 7-3 I'm pretty sure yeah
[2:04:16] <GigaBowserRoA> 50-50, 55-45, and 60-40 at absolute worst
[2:04:17] <animailistic> maybe 6-4 Fors-elli but thats it
[2:04:26] <Cykron> @axmos It’s not
[2:04:31] <GigaBowserRoA> Sylv v zetter is 60-40
[2:04:36] <+Shadowwize> Shadowwize subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:04:37] <GigaBowserRoA> Zetter FUCKS sylv

[2:05:16] <ItsAGundamu> Damn this game is pretty cool
[2:05:17] <Kalcom> isn't he low tier?
[2:05:18] <DiamondStormOwO> Giga plays Sylv
[2:05:19] <DiamondStormOwO> sp....
[2:05:25] <GigaBowserRoA> Best in the business
[2:05:25] <ZakosDryiakk> There are two sylv mains here
[2:05:27] <Nevereatcars> giga is the top sylv player BY DEFAULT
[2:05:31] <ZakosDryiakk> So the legend says
[2:05:37] <GigaBowserRoA> Sylv is often considered at the bottom lol
[2:05:47] <+UnprecedentedStudios> Yeah Giga is the best Sylv
[2:05:49] <animailistic> my point remains, sylv isnt played by like anyone
[2:05:51] <DiamondStormOwO> Sylv needs more players tbh
[2:05:52] <GigaBowserRoA> Not unviable by any means, but the least good
[2:05:55] <+UnprecedentedStudios> I'm the second best Kappa
[2:05:58] <@akuda_bar> sylvanos looks like a scrunt
[2:05:59] <Goldenwolf98> No hazards online I think
[2:06:02] <Axmos> no hazards on the legal versions
[2:06:05] <animailistic> and im a clair main for christs sake
[2:06:09] <GigaBowserRoA> he definitely does but the people who do play em push em super hard
[2:06:11] <Nevereatcars> @WoolieVersus hazards aren't part of the game. you guys had a setting wrong.
[2:06:13] <Axmos> you can turn legal version on local
[2:06:15] <NebulaPurple> Sylv nair is so fun
[2:06:32] <NebulaPurple> almost as fun as DA Kappa
[2:06:35] <+bootysteve> angle the squirt reggie
[2:06:36] <+razielhex> kind of a all pokémon smash-like
[2:06:37] <animailistic> you have too gigbowswer if noone is playing him

[2:06:48] <@akuda_bar> Angle the Squirt
[2:06:50] <GigaBowserRoA> I am tho
[2:06:57] <+razielhex> turtle the squirtle
[2:07:02] <Cykron> Angle that squirt. It helps if you pinch the tip
[2:07:04] <GigaBowserRoA> best sylv in the business
[2:07:04] <animailistic> Literal Shout of Earth bois rise up
[2:07:08] <PsychReality> Why is nobody playing Ronald
[2:07:11] <Vortigon> Why are hazards not available online?
[2:07:22] <NebulaPurple> cause online is mostly for comp
[2:07:23] <Axmos> its a competitive game
[2:07:26] <GigaBowserRoA> ^
[2:07:27] <NebulaPurple> they will be in definitive edition
[2:07:34] <Nevereatcars> they will?
[2:07:36] <PsychReality> oh right online
[2:07:40] <masterfire23> the workshop characters for this game look ridiculous LUL
[2:07:40] <DiamondStormOwO> you can turn them on
[2:07:40] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:07:42] <ZakosDryiakk> Afaik yeah
[2:07:43] <@akuda_bar> orca pupy
[2:07:47] <@Menitta> lmao I have had nothing but under water matches
[2:07:48] <Vortigon> Why are hazards not for competitive? Aren't they consistent?
[2:07:51] <+Grayhammatter> got caught stepping in the squirt
[2:07:51] <GigaBowserRoA> mhm they will there are a bunch of settings you can change even in casual
[2:07:51] <NebulaPurple> ye, in the workshop branch there's alreadya setting to turn them on
[2:07:52] <DiamondStormOwO> on the new netcode7
[2:07:54] <animailistic> >alpharad makes like 4 meme vids >wheres 100% accurate ronald mcdio
[2:07:56] <GigaBowserRoA> but they have to agree with it
[2:08:04] <NebulaPurple> ye but they're still busted, and the aether mode can also change stage layout
[2:08:08] <ZakosDryiakk> @masterfire23 olympia, astra, trummel and pomme
[2:08:12] <TheBrunoZone> This "Definitive Edition" will be updated on other platforms as well or is it just a Switch thingy?
[2:08:12] <NebulaPurple> like, Aetehr Tower of Heaven is disgusting
[2:08:15] <ZakosDryiakk> You can check the rest l8r
[2:08:19] <NebulaPurple> it'd be permaban
[2:08:30] <Nevereatcars> @Vortigon you'd have to see some of the worse stage hazards to understand
[2:08:33] <Nevereatcars> some of them instakill

[2:08:56] <ZakosDryiakk> Oh and mollo
[2:08:56] <NebulaPurple> Treetop is really bad, Tower is really bad
[2:08:57] <Nevereatcars> by deciding they wouldn't need to be part of the competitive balance from the beginning, the devs could focus on making them fun
[2:08:59] <Saltmeisterr> Slyv's aether stage is a oof from me

[2:21:49] <PsychReality> Are the guys gonna do Rivals for fun with the workshop?
[2:21:51] <Axmos> the f are they are a custom build or something

[2:22:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> go menitta
[2:22:14] <Axmos> they are only finding people they know almost

[2:22:37] <+Grayhammatter> go menitta!
[2:22:37] <PsychReality> Nah @Axmos casual is usually pretty dead so majority of players will be people watching the stream
[2:22:48] <NebulaPurple> the official rivals discord has a bunch of regional servers linked in the rules
[2:22:50] <animailistic> I dont use it much anymore but its great
[2:22:52] <Axmos> but its not
[2:22:58] <Axmos> i just found like 10 other people
[2:23:12] <PsychReality> Right now? It's alive because of people wanting to play with these guys
[2:23:17] <@Solidus_113> They need to get a way to completely allow Workshop characters and have them download while in character select
[2:23:35] <+Wool> fuck I'm an idiot, I was searching for him on the Workshop build, not default
[2:23:39] <+Wool> no wonder why I wasn't getting matched
[2:23:42] <NebulaPurple> that'd be neat
[2:23:51] <Saltmeisterr> wow menetta
[2:23:51] <PsychReality> Workshop characters are legal online on the workshop beta but it'd be nice to have autodownload on random matchmade games
[2:24:13] <Kalcom> but workshop when tho
[2:24:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> i'm comming back for them hands fucker
[2:24:32] <NebulaPurple> Ultimate is STINKY! Buy Rivals Instead!

[2:28:43] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:28:51] <Kalcom> no pillar
[2:28:55] <@Menitta> this game is weird but kind of awesome
[2:29:03] <+universepenguin> yea I love this game
[2:29:26] <Nivrap> Does Reggie know that Zetter's smash attacks do extra knockback if the enemy is on fire?
[2:29:29] <JumboMan214> @WoolieVersus Im playing on PS4 controller BTW
[2:29:35] <JumboMan214> If I was on Gamecube controller
[2:29:38] <JumboMan214> ooooooweeeeee
[2:29:42] <@Menitta> I need a USB gamecube controller
[2:29:44] <jubejube56> Lol seems kinda impossible for a newbie to learn online
[2:29:56] <jubejube56> Feels so much like one touch deaths
[2:30:08] <+Wool> getting matched up is so hard :'(
[2:30:10] <BackwardCap> Yes you can, I'm doing it right now.
[2:30:11] <@Menitta> Oh yeah the adapter is USB
[2:30:24] <Milo_Oda> combo get!
[2:30:24] <+universepenguin> yea if you download the drivers you can use the wii u adapter
[2:30:33] <TheBrunoZone> Dude, the moment you start playing rivals on a gamecube controller the world around you shapes itself
[2:30:51] <+universepenguin> funny you say that, most of the top players use xbone
[2:30:51] <DiamondStormOwO> bruh, just play on a keyboard
[2:30:51] <@Menitta> I wanna play this with a DDR pad
[2:30:55] <Nivrap> does the Switch adapter work as well?
[2:31:17] <+universepenguin> yea, as far as I know they're the same thing outside of cosmetic appearance @Nivrap
[2:31:36] <TheBrunoZone> The xbone controller is more stick oriented, so I wouldn't be surprised
[2:31:53] <@Menitta> I was using an Xbox Elite controller
[2:31:55] <@Menitta> Felt weird
[2:32:03] <animailistic> nah dudes its all about k-e-y-b-o-a-r-d
[2:32:08] <@Solidus_113> look at big money man her

[2:48:12] <animailistic> sorry im also playing rivals whilst coming in here randomly
[2:48:17] <Tohisu> "Mmh!"
[2:48:25] <+universepenguin> I'm debating who to play if I get the snipe
[2:48:26] <+Wool> has Woolie actually bought something or has he only opened the menu
[2:48:28] <FeltSn0wman> you can buy on the respawn platform im p sure
[2:48:30] <Kalcom> nope
[2:48:36] <+oberon123> go forsburn
[2:48:40] <Saltmeisterr> damn dude this game so sick
[2:48:42] <Kalcom> he hasn't bought anything
[2:48:42] <+oberon123> just go for crazy mindgames
[2:48:46] <animailistic> Penguin just play some jank
[2:48:50] <old_dog_god> Why is Woolie buying powerups from himself
[2:48:52] <KSDM> Play Snek
[2:48:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> man, EVO needs to do another charity game for main stage so we can FORCE skullgirls to be played on main stage.
[2:48:53] <Saltmeisterr> can't wait for switch version
[2:48:57] <+universepenguin> what if I just spam shine with zetter
[2:49:03] <KSDM> I can't wait for rollback
[2:49:07] <+oberon123> didnt they say theyd never let it be at evo
[2:49:08] <animailistic> Ive seen enough footage of you to know your in the stratosphere compared to these guys just play with them
[2:49:29] <+Shoosler> lol
[2:49:37] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @KSDM
[2:49:38] <JumboMan214> lol
[2:49:44] <JumboMan214> gg
[2:49:47] <JumboMan214> i played like shit
[2:49:47] <KSDM> Straight up Pasta Fazole that last much
[2:49:56] <Kalcom> somehow, woolie wins without buying
[2:50:02] <TheBrunoZone> @CaptainPileDriver Considering the state of Melee, I wouldn't do that if I were you
[2:50:03] <animailistic> Actually just show off how ranno works for them if possible
[2:50:06] <+oberon123> penguin im vs you LOL
[2:50:07] <+Wool> HHHAHA
[2:50:08] <Solidnick18> come on wool
[2:50:09] <Solidnick18> YEEE
[2:50:10] <JumboMan214> im rusty with Sylvanos
[2:50:11] <+universepenguin> fuck
[2:50:13] <+Grayhammatter> ye
[2:50:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> @TheBrunoZone why?
[2:50:14] <Axmos> smh
[2:50:15] <@Menitta> Eyyy he got it
[2:50:20] <%CaptainPileDriver> good for wool
[2:50:20] <+oberon123> run it coward
[2:50:28] <@Menitta> destroy him
[2:50:28] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:50:29] <+universepenguin> how much I gotta dono for a bo5 lol
[2:50:49] <JumboMan214> @Menitta lets play
[2:50:52] <Axmos> he'll do it
[2:51:01] <animailistic> it starts with getting online i guess boss
[2:51:05] <TheBrunoZone> @CaptainPileDriver Because since it got pulled from the main stage, I bet you the next charity they will dominate the polls again
[2:51:19] <+asgard147> limesPoggers
[2:51:26] <TheBrunoZone> And personally, I REALLY want skullgirls to be at EVO
[2:51:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> @TheBrunoZone yeah but if it's a charity stream, it's literally anybodies game, cause umvc3 could raise the funds or skullgirls, either or honestly
[2:52:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> if melee raised it then they deserve it
[2:52:32] <animailistic> Skullgirls does well enough, combo breaker is the new evo anyway
[2:52:38] <+cawi> smash attacks when the opponent is on fire adds knockback
[2:52:39] <%CaptainPileDriver> is it?
[2:52:42] <+Grayhammatter> clapped
[2:52:56] <+universepenguin> when on fire zetter smash attacks have a 1.5x multiplier on knockback
[2:52:56] <animailistic> we need Rivals to get on a big stage thats not smash shaped
[2:53:10] <Kalcom> NO ITEMS
[2:53:12] <TheBrunoZone> @CaptainPileDriver You have a point. But yet, melee has won already a spot via charity streams, and it got featured on the documental
[2:53:17] <Kalcom> FOX ONLY
[2:53:21] <PsychReality> just make Treetop Lodge tourney legal
[2:53:24] <%Ecchigun> lets go reggieee
[2:53:28] <+universepenguin> it is @PsychReality
[2:53:30] <PsychReality> Or no, Bamboo whatever
[2:53:32] <Solidnick18> hell yeah
[2:53:33] <PsychReality> The Guadua stage
[2:53:34] <Axmos> it is thou
[2:53:36] <thunderhog> NO ITEMS NO LASERS
[2:53:36] <+universepenguin> oh
[2:53:38] <Axmos> or lol
[2:53:42] <+universepenguin> there are too many platforms on that thing lol
[2:53:54] <Axmos> make big forest floor a CP
[2:53:55] <+universepenguin> we have enough stages in the meantime
[2:53:57] <TheBrunoZone> @CaptainPileDriver Plus, knowing the grudge melee players have torwards EVO, I can guarantee you they'll vote for it again LUL
[2:54:00] <PsychReality> I mostly agree but its at least a unique big stage
[2:54:21] <Datwiseguy> wait evos doin charity again?
[2:54:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> no
[2:54:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> but i want them to
[2:54:40] <+oberon123> they wont
[2:54:45] <chronoxgp> i was playing cuphead today that game is nuts
[2:54:48] <+oberon123> because melee would win and thats not something they want LOL
[2:54:49] <+asgard147> limesLUL
[2:54:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> @TheBrunoZone with that in mind there's also plenty of people who would spite vote against it
[2:55:00] <Saltmeisterr> cuphhead is great
[2:55:06] <CirclesForever> which one is pikachu
[2:55:08] <Datwiseguy> also just sounds like a way to breed animosity between games
[2:55:16] <Saltmeisterr> probably in my top ten
[2:55:17] <+oberon123> as if there isnt enough already
[2:55:25] <Datwiseguy> thats what happened last time
[2:55:38] <%CaptainPileDriver> did it?
[2:55:41] <+Wool> gg lmao
[2:55:43] <chronoxgp> cup head is like contra, star wars and looneytunes/jazz in one.
[2:55:46] <@Solidus_113> 0-2
[2:55:51] <+asgard147> gg limesYay
[2:55:54] <@Solidus_113> BUT IT WAS CLOSE
[2:55:55] <%CaptainPileDriver> WHEN'S THE JANK
[2:55:59] <TheBrunoZone> @CaptainPileDriver Boy, trust me, they would do ANYTHING to have Melee back at EVO main stage
[2:56:01] <Solidnick18> gg
[2:56:13] <Kalcom> ok but worshop tho
[2:56:16] <+universepenguin> @WoolieVersus how much I gotta dono for a bo5 lol
[2:56:20] <KSDM> ABSA Kreygasm
[2:56:23] <+thewaifoo> regardless if melee comes back to evo, nothing much would change in the scene
[2:56:30] <Axmos> he'll do it
[2:56:33] <%CaptainPileDriver> @TheBrunoZone i mean, i guess, idk why, i'd rather have a slot at combo breaker honestly
[2:56:34] <+Wool> man that took way too much work to get matched lmao
[2:56:34] <DedlokPM> they have a wooloo with them. rooAww
[2:56:36] <old_dog_god> What is this Sonic Advance main menu
[2:56:41] <Solidnick18> the scene will be the same

[2:56:47] <Saltmeisterr> oh shit a sheep
[2:56:52] <PsychReality> Wait this guy's a real player hold on
[2:56:53] <+Grayhammatter> wow

[2:56:56] <%CaptainPileDriver> welp this match is basically over
[2:56:57] <Datwiseguy> does lamb do anything?
[2:57:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> this is a real player
[2:57:01] <+LucentWulf> absa is radical to play
[2:57:01] <KSDM> Absa is basically Ness, Mewtwo, and Pikachu
[2:57:05] <TheBrunoZone> @CaptainPileDriver Exactly. Focus on other majors.
[2:57:07] <Saltmeisterr> oh boi woolie getting bodied
[2:57:09] <PsychReality> Absa is Pikachu Zelda Jigglypuff
[2:57:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Datwiseguy no, i think it's just a background thing
[2:57:15] <+Dimfish> id say absa more ness and zelda but yeah
[2:57:19] <Axmos> how is she ness or jiggly
[2:57:22] <animailistic> boomer woolie doesnt understand a literal expert in trying to get on the stream rn
[2:57:24] <Kalcom> easy prey
[2:57:27] <KSDM> Dair, DJC
[2:57:31] <PsychReality> Jiggly's air mobility/floatiness
[2:57:31] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[2:57:40] <LoneFonte> dear lord
[2:57:41] <Axmos> dair has a sweet spot
[2:57:45] <KSDM> Dair is literally the same frame data as PM ness Dair
[2:57:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> @TheBrunoZone EVO is big cause it's the most known so it's nice if you're a new game there cause everybody goes, but if you want a more fun time, go to combobreaker
[2:57:46] <animailistic> Literally top 3 talent trying to get in here and nothing

[2:59:16] <JumboMan214> @WoolieVersus If im on next time can I face off reggie?
[2:59:25] <KSDM> You can't reflect cloud but it stuns her for like 3 seconds
[2:59:25] <PsychReality> Alpharad's Absa video is from 1.0 or earlier iirc
[2:59:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> @TheBrunoZone it's the most fun, but not the EVO replacement yet
[2:59:26] <Axmos> @WoolieVersus you got a donation
[2:59:36] <+universepenguin> yea alpha's absa vid is super old
[2:59:38] <amavii> Alpha has a video like that for everyone but the snake
[2:59:38] <KSDM> Early Access
[2:59:48] <TheBrunoZone> CC 2019 was their BEST event so far
[2:59:51] <+cawi> you can tether lightning to the cloud if hold B with it out.

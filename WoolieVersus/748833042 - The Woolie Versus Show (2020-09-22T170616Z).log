[0:31:56] <%Proxzo> @SuperFightinRobot woolieYE
[0:31:58] <a_mad_dragon> saboteur is fun for the first two thirds of the game and then you get tired of it
[0:32:01] <ManEaterPug> Everyone's hair on stream is immaculate
[0:32:03] <penitentpentwitch> Better than my name. I didn't bother to capitalize anything so people shorten me to "Pent Witch"

[1:36:46] <yusefHD> Every once in a while I'll find a fox shrine without a fox and it'll just spawn for pets.
[1:37:08] <MayorRev> lil foxy

[1:41:07] <%CptnCampy61> I never really used way of the flame
[1:41:14] <penitentpentwitch> Honestly I prefer the 'sidequest tier' system where they're tied to areas that unlock as you progress. As opposed to Yakuza's "Well you can stall out for 6 hours in real estate right now."

[3:14:32] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Shameless plugging
[3:14:34] <+DesertPenguin> hahaha
[3:15:08] <+cursedwithadhd> it was very nostalgic seeing Reach multiplayer
[3:15:08] <%Irridium> you should do more halo mulitplayer
[3:15:52] <%emperordread> "Don't overthink it" - Woolie to anyone LUL
[3:15:55] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Woolie desperately trying to hide his arms
[3:15:57] <mellorolo> do some halo multiplayer online
[3:16:05] <%Theycallmenerf> I was happy seeing Woolie experience some of what Halo’s multiplayer has to offer.
[3:16:06] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Woolie's arms, his secret shame
[3:16:09] <+mechslayer71> @mellorolo he did
[3:16:15] <jorniev> woolie maybe really good at reading players instead of the computer
[3:16:43] <%Theycallmenerf> Woolie the tattle
[3:16:46] <@Moobot> Easy with the emojis @mellorolo
[3:17:13] <mellorolo> hah, no way xD
[3:17:27] <%doomerskeletor13> Also you didn’t have to reload in Doom
[3:17:44] <+TheNeonGraveyard> hl2: don't forget to reload dr. Freeman!
[3:18:06] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Does that shirt say "Hero Jesus?"
[3:18:22] <T_Sasquatch> I reload after every kill LUL

[3:18:38] <T_Sasquatch> Hell i reload after one bullet LUL
[3:18:53] <MartwyPies> fat
[3:18:59] <+mechslayer71> Did i shoot the gun, and I don’t have immediate threats? Reload.
[3:19:11] <+cursedwithadhd> is that how you played Titanfall2? without reloading!
[3:19:12] <eldragon_1> "drop your shield" LUL
[3:19:41] <CappuccinoGuil> YOU DON'T PAY MY SUB
[3:19:48] <arkv01> but what if i pay the sub and suddenly I'm behind you with a gun
[3:20:11] <T_Sasquatch> I still haven't encountered anyone crazy in ffxiv
[3:20:20] <T_Sasquatch> Almost 200 hours in
[3:20:24] <CappuccinoGuil> In MMOs, if you don't do your job, EVERYONE suffers. So by going "you don't pay my sub" is really shitty
[3:20:51] <CappuccinoGuil> now, if you're playing a single-player game or a chill game, people telling you how to play can be really annoying
[3:21:00] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Not even any weird sex stuff @T_Sasquatch ?

[0:16:10] <CreisiSweg> What about animekisa?
[0:16:37] <%kekkerscrew> I really have to say this. When I was a kid growing up. I'd head to China Town every weekend spending 30 bucks to pick up two 15 dollar VHS of fansubbed anime. Max of 3-4 episodes per tape.
[0:16:44] <CreisiSweg> yeah, a streaming site, kinda recent
[0:17:00] <vVAstrAVv> btw woolie thanks for shilling the boys i binged it all thursday that was good shit
[0:17:33] <%kekkerscrew> If you told me as a Kid I could just spend 15 bucks a month or so for an anime streaming site I'd have told you that you were crazy and sign me up.

[0:20:07] <%kekkerscrew> That's why I don't really see the defense for pirating anime right now. Except in specific circumstances like stuff that is under threat of not existing anymore.
[0:20:51] <masterfire23> why arr we talking about pirating
[0:21:10] <masterfire23> R)
[0:21:43] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Man I remember back in the day connecting to IRC bots to download the Rockman.EXE anime
[0:22:18] <+p4ntless> all I care about convenience, I don't mind paying for streaming services but when it comes to shit that isn't on one of those and my only option is pay out the ass for physical it's time to fire up the VPN

[0:46:05] <%alexandrecau> or if you have flaming arrow
[0:46:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> I mean even when we got early guns bears didn't give a fuck
[0:46:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> so I can't even imagine trying to deal with one before guns
[0:46:48] <ralphfromdk> It might be on the roof / in the rafters of the house if the bug is stuck like that
[0:46:55] <T_Sasquatch> You just don't LUL
[0:47:29] <+p4ntless> no yeah you're really gonna want to upgrade some armor that you may or may not be getting soon
[0:47:33] <slix3431> Imagine seeing a guy pre-gun wearing a bear-head
[0:48:05] <%doomerskeletor13> LUL

[0:48:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> b i r d
[0:48:46] <artificerjoni> "Karhu" is comes from the word "Karhea" (coarse). Another common name is "Otso" (IIRC from "otsa" forehead). My favourite thing is "Mesikämmen metsänherra" (Meadpaw forestlord)
[0:48:46] <SomeAsianDood> Bird bird bird
[0:49:01] <%alexandrecau> Bird is like a god so norio understand

[0:50:10] <%kekkerscrew> That's not a record. That's literally that woman's Mail.
[0:50:13] <artificerjoni> Bears were a Holy Animal in ancient Finnish belief from what I gather
[0:50:19] <Reizie_Etherealm> Kappa
[0:50:30] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @DashXero added with travelers attire in a patch... after i finished the game

[0:51:07] <%DashXero> @cobalt_phoenix_ Oh man... It must have happened after I finished the game too.
[0:51:09] <sonofthedeepsouth> Lets us play Tenchu. It has demons and ninjas
[0:51:30] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @DashXero thankfully platting didn't require all records
[0:51:40] <+Neoripo> I miss Tenchu
[0:51:44] <Reizie_Etherealm> Tenchu having demons scared me shitless as a child, it was so out of the blue back then
[0:51:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh fuck that
[0:51:48] <%DashXero> @cobalt_phoenix_ It doesn't!?
[0:51:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @DashXero nope
[0:52:05] <%DashXero> @cobalt_phoenix_ That's really odd.
[0:52:10] <SomeAsianDood> Yup Platting is surprisngly easy for tsushima
[0:52:17] <%KNYGHT87> jaboodyCool @DashXero
[0:52:28] <%DashXero> @KNYGHT87 YO! dashxeWolf
[0:52:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> but I will say some of the secret trophies felt kinda impossible to do if you didn't know you had to do that
[0:52:30] <RamenRiderZ> I like how they do it in RDR2 "Like I was saying..."
[0:52:49] <sonofthedeepsouth> Good tactics
[0:53:00] <SomeAsianDood> I like how they did it in the new GOW "Stories are for the boat"
[0:53:06] <Reizie_Etherealm> Or even in Uncharted "Anyway, where were we? Oh right..."
[0:53:13] <%DashXero> @cobalt_phoenix_ Yeah. I recently found out about having to kick enemies off of a high place.
[0:53:15] <%kekkerscrew> That is the weapon of a badass
[0:53:36] <+p4ntless> we love a thicc king
[0:53:38] <%DSD24> Oh man I love Norio's quests
[0:53:47] <%alexandrecau> you can horse ride
[0:53:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> norioh best boi, i wanna give him a hug
[0:54:18] <%DashXero> Norio is the coolest.
[0:54:31] <+p4ntless> norio probably gives good hugs
[0:54:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> didn't egyptians think rubbing shit on wounds was supposed to help
[0:54:49] <sonofthedeepsouth> Norioh was made for the Bara audience
[0:55:04] <%Sparkseid> same
[0:55:09] <%DashXero> Khal Drogo
[0:55:30] <T_Sasquatch> He cares LUL
[0:55:34] <sonofthedeepsouth> Khal drogo was awesome
[0:55:40] <sonofthedeepsouth> A crown for a king
[0:55:41] <+p4ntless> I love the idea of a healer who's actually a just a really good necromancer and doesn't even realize it
[0:56:06] <BlackermanZX> Urth dies doodTerror
[0:56:15] <sonofthedeepsouth> gets kids are shit
[0:56:39] <%cobalt_phoenix_> would he say... it's a tool of justice?
[0:56:57] <Reizie_Etherealm> Not used in anger?
[0:56:58] <sonofthedeepsouth> They are all those of justice
[0:57:02] <%alexandrecau> What is your stance about stabbing them in the back norio
[0:57:08] <Make_me_mad> Norio is a human Eeyore.
[0:57:13] <sonofthedeepsouth> Valentine did nothing wrong
[0:57:36] <+p4ntless> look at the haft on that fuckin naginata, that shit's gotta weigh a ton

[0:58:17] <%DSD24> Ah there was a tree there
[0:58:50] <%alexandrecau> mongols man
[0:58:58] <%pre10cious_1> pre10cious_1 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:59:09] <RamenRiderZ> buncha savages!
[0:59:14] <+p4ntless> oh that's just Gurglin' Jerry, he does that sometimes
[0:59:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> QA POWERS
[0:59:15] <sonofthedeepsouth> shadow assassin
[0:59:16] <%GeneralSCPatton> Jin "Shankman" Sakai
[0:59:54] <dellis80> is this based off a true story? like everything in the game? (outside of customization of course)
[1:00:07] <SomeAsianDood> Nope
[1:00:26] <Make_me_mad> @dellis80 The mongols did invade Japan, twice. It didn't go so hot either time. Outside of that general context, not really, no.
[1:00:29] <LockingKey> inspired by historic events
[1:00:41] <SomeAsianDood> The invasion of Tsushima was a real event
[1:00:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> lol they got wrecked by storms twice
[1:00:48] <%DashXero> Loosely inspired by historic events.
[1:00:53] <SomeAsianDood> But every Japanese samurai died on that beach
[1:00:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> DOSHO
[1:01:01] <%DashXero> So loose, it would make poor underwear.
[1:01:09] <%alexandrecau> good thing the mongols don'T fight on horses huh
[1:01:14] <Reizie_Etherealm> The story might not be accurate, neither are the events but the premise is true. Mongols did invade
[1:01:42] <%DSD24> Wow that guy did a dash
[1:02:09] <Reizie_Etherealm> Don't fight Lu Bu tho
[1:02:14] <+p4ntless> that tree was a mongol, you did the right thing
[1:02:16] <%DSD24> Come on Woolie that Lu Bu shit was rad
[1:02:34] <%DSD24> Oh I feel you then
[1:02:43] <sonofthedeepsouth> IT'T'S LU BU
[1:02:50] <danknugglit> Bigger hat = more power
[1:03:04] <Reizie_Etherealm> Function over form, very practical I like that
[1:03:17] <%DashXero> Only powerful necks carry big hats.
[1:04:10] <%DSD24> Oh boy More Ishikawa missions
[1:04:16] <Make_me_mad> Fun fact: Tsushima got wrecked even harder in the second invasion, historically, so no matter how this game ends it's gonna be a bummer for these guys a few years from now.
[1:04:36] <VZLANemesis> i wonder if this game will be playable on ps5?
[1:05:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Make_me_mad all i'm hearing is sequel
[1:05:32] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:05:36] <Reizie_Etherealm> I also like how the mongols skipped tsushima later on by travelling from was it China I believe?
[1:05:48] <+p4ntless> @VZLANemesis I'd hope so, I'll definitely give it a second playthough if I can do it at 4k/60
[1:05:54] <T_Sasquatch> DDDDuel
[1:05:59] <DavidDredd84> Damn looks like they’re only like 1/3 through if that
[1:06:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> doesn't sound like he got there
[1:06:36] <T_Sasquatch> Its a mythic quest
[1:06:48] <Make_me_mad> @Reizie_Etherealm They had multiple fleets that invasion. Some of them skipped Tsushima but the korean fleet stopped by and stomped the island into the dirt just for the nostalgia.
[1:07:09] <Reizie_Etherealm> Nostalgia lmao
[1:07:12] <%DensityD> compose a shitty (great) haiku
[1:07:15] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[1:07:17] <%doomerskeletor13> They’re in set locations
[1:07:17] <Make_me_mad> Cannot be overstated how hard they lost every battle.
[1:07:25] <Afterman_> there is an icon
[1:07:27] <Afterman_> on the map
[1:07:29] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yes
[1:07:30] <%DashXero> Samurai silhouete
[1:07:33] <+nintendograndpA64> what a nimble ass horse
[1:08:00] <%Sparkseid> There's an Icon on the map, though it's very small
[1:08:04] <Reizie_Etherealm> What's wrong with that horse's legs??
[1:08:07] <%doomerskeletor13> It will be a lone straw hat in a very obvious dueling arena
[1:08:32] <nopgnikatnight> ouch, horse tree
[1:08:37] <T_Sasquatch> It's called six blades of kojiro if you encounter it
[1:09:04] <Make_me_mad> There are so many cool locations in this game where you end up not having fights.
[1:09:09] <nopgnikatnight> N I C E
[1:09:15] <%DSD24> Dagger man
[1:09:16] <+solzan2000> lol
[1:09:20] <Make_me_mad> I wish there was a button to spawn enemies so you could have radical battles wherever you wanted.
[1:09:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[1:09:23] <Reizie_Etherealm> KNOIFE
[1:09:24] <%DashXero> How were you sleeping?!
[1:09:59] <ralphfromdk> The power of GUN
[1:10:00] <%DashXero> Standoffs are the best, though. Easiest way to kill guys.
[1:10:01] <T_Sasquatch> Game audio really ramped up above your speaking
[1:10:02] <Make_me_mad> By the end of the game I was ignoring standoffs and starting every battle by throwing a bomb into the crowd.
[1:10:02] <%cobalt_phoenix_> GUN
[1:10:08] <+p4ntless> those patrols get REAL
[1:10:14] <danknugglit> Gun stance
[1:10:33] <+gnoame> Cannon guy was more dangerous to his friends than Jin
[1:10:34] <gamewarden92> handgonne
[1:10:40] <%DashXero> The patrols get real, you just gotta get realer.
[1:10:42] <%cobalt_phoenix_> did anyone ever reach the limit for any resource other than bamboo?
[1:10:48] <dellis80> I have a question about an event I do not know if he is past or not. all I'm going to say is that it involves a girl
[1:10:49] <ralphfromdk> Heads up Woolie and co, game audio is a bit louder than you, especially in combat
[1:11:06] <+p4ntless> RUN IT BACK
[1:11:25] <%DSD24> Ooo he was close that time
[1:11:25] <+gnoame> TWO FOR TWO
[1:11:35] <+p4ntless> big boy stance
[1:11:38] <Overloard> i feel like the standoffs get harder later into the game
[1:11:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> 0-2
[1:11:45] <ralphfromdk> It's a brute even when he has a boom stick
[1:11:54] <Reizie_Etherealm> Getting GANKED
[1:11:59] <%DSD24> Friendly Fire
[1:12:19] <ralphfromdk> That is correct, stance is for guard damage
[1:12:30] <Overloard> i perfected every standoff on the first chapter but after that my standoff success took a nosedive
[1:12:42] <%DSD24> They aren't Assassins Creeding it
[1:12:42] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:13:00] <Make_me_mad> Other fun historical fact: This invasion force was actually kind of small because the mongols were still consolidating power. The second invasion happened after they'd settled their own affairs and could really dedicated their forces to the battle.
[1:13:06] <+solzan2000> boo
[1:13:21] <Overloard> the traveler garb in white is absolutely GOAT
[1:13:25] <Make_me_mad> So this game is fighting the weak-ass mongols while the big boys loom on the horizon.
[1:13:36] <%Malik1002> these Mongols have no honor as they slight there throats from the shadow
[1:13:40] <Reizie_Etherealm> RUDE
[1:13:59] <gamewarden92> "Those guys were BAMF."
[1:14:48] <%alexandrecau> look up while playing seeing the sky clear is great
[1:14:49] <jorniev> ah yes... grass
[1:15:22] <dellis80> mmmm, BAMF, my favorite. I love the sound they make when their asses hit the ground LUL
[1:15:30] <%alexandrecau> no it's because you have no homnor
[1:15:31] <Reizie_Etherealm> Woolie, sorry to intrude but can you check what flute song you have equipped?
[1:15:45] <%alexandrecau> if you use ghost weapon it set storm
[1:15:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> Dishonor = more storminess
[1:15:54] <afronooch> did minh ever get his cherry coke?
[1:15:57] <%DSD24> Dagger Man again
[1:16:00] <%DSD24> YEeeee
[1:16:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> NICE
[1:16:07] <Make_me_mad> Woolie: "Minh you're wrong actually, let me repeat what you just said back at you"
[1:16:13] <theCoolChild> Is that why i always had storms
[1:16:25] <%rottingpastry> They die eventually
[1:16:33] <StebTheVee> they die
[1:16:57] <%rottingpastry> I have seen one get stuck before.
[1:16:59] <jorniev> like shooting guys in the gut in MGS5
[1:17:06] <%GeneralSCPatton> They do not path like that. They will mush their face into a rock without going anywhere.
[1:17:08] <+gnoame> a butt lusty samurai

[1:24:32] <%DSD24> @Estuko That's pretty cute actually
[1:24:35] <Reizie_Etherealm> So much backstory being established just by having characters talk about the past
[1:24:41] <gamewarden92> I do that too.
[1:24:42] <Make_me_mad> "I stare at the ground because I wanna see what's up"
[1:24:54] <vVAstrAVv> but you cant trip in games so see the sights

[1:25:22] <%DashXero> We need a scientific study on this shit.
[1:25:24] <%doomerskeletor13> Me too Woolie
[1:25:33] <trickquestionz> I do that because I dislike eye contact.
[1:25:37] <vVAstrAVv> minh loves rhidorana i bet lol
[1:25:43] <T_Sasquatch> Weird i don't think i look down while walking , i look ahead and mentally note what's coming
[1:25:44] <%alexandrecau> You'll miss it anyway
[1:25:44] <PirateMike_> My friends yell at me when in CSGO I always look low and end up shooting toes
[1:25:47] <jorniev> ITS NOT REAL... but I do that
[1:25:50] <arkv01> don't look up, game devs don't want you to see their awful skyboxes
[1:25:57] <%SomeSageAdvice> to be fair, Woolie did avoid some bad situations in Dark Souls by looking at the ground
[1:26:17] <PanicSwytch> I used to do that when i was a kid
[1:26:35] <chaos2frozen> the only time I'm looking down while walking is when I'm staring at my phone lol
[1:26:39] <T_Sasquatch> Speaking of which i cannot imagine trying to lp any from soft game
[1:26:46] <trickquestionz> Woolie can't find his father's grave.

[1:50:31] <T_Sasquatch> What do you mean doing stinger 100 times in a row isn't effective
[1:50:59] <Reizie_Etherealm> Nice throw
[1:51:15] <%DSD24> If anything you should always spam Stinger cause its the best move
[1:51:19] <Aussie_Manny> i can't believe Woolie killed all those guys... AGAIN
[1:51:55] <%rottingpastry> I dunno, stagger pays off a lot.
[1:52:21] <%rottingpastry> You can't lose any collectibles
[1:52:33] <+CptnCampy61> It doesn’t destroy whole area
[1:52:51] <%rottingpastry> Even when it does, you at most lose like crafting materials, which aren't a problem
[1:53:01] <RamenRiderZ> one thing that annoyed me on mgsv, you get all the cool toys but you get punished because murder bad
[1:53:49] <Reizie_Etherealm> Is there any consequence for being evil in that game?
[1:53:59] <+TooManyGs> how are you liking the game?
[1:54:02] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @RamenRiderZ yeah that's the problem with a lot of games that make stealth optional, but not really since not going stealth/nonlethal is "bad"
[1:54:20] <%rottingpastry> It's pointing out the mongols that need to die
[1:54:26] <T_Sasquatch> @reizie_etherealm nope
[1:54:53] <%rottingpastry> I think it shows up when there aren't a lot of them left?

[1:57:08] <%DashXero> Conversations with the Khan are the best.
[1:57:19] <+xdeathknightx> I have the same problem, it would be cool if you could tag some things up front. If I am lucky I will see a hornet nest and then no-one goes near it

[1:57:43] <%doomerskeletor13> Jobal Kahn
[1:57:50] <%rottingpastry> Don't ask me why the Mongols are writing in Japanese
[1:57:58] <KitsuneManami> Next Bit!
[1:58:06] <sonofthedeepsouth> nice
[1:58:13] <%alexandrecau> khotun is revolutionary even for a mongil
[1:58:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wow he's dishonorable even by mongol standards
[1:58:27] <%DashXero> I stan Khotun Khan.
[1:58:27] <KitsuneManami> Kahn says NEXT BIT!
[1:58:30] <gamewarden92> Stealing the best parts of other cultures is great.
[1:58:33] <%alexandrecau> they aren't jin can read mongol
[1:58:37] <%DensityD> guys, in woolie's "lets keep this thing going" what is the context of the clip of woolie furiously shaking on the couch with reggie and minh? it's a naruto moment, right? which one?
[1:58:43] <%DensityD> he shakes his dreads so much
[1:58:47] <heartlesshealer> Jin's studied
[1:58:52] <sonofthedeepsouth> Standing armies almost always get BTFO by steppe hordes
[1:58:55] <KitsuneManami> Thats Sharks
[1:58:56] <gamewarden92> Not always
[1:59:02] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @DensityD i thought that was post dokapon session
[1:59:03] <SomeAsianDood> They can sit
[1:59:04] <sonofthedeepsouth> Cause Horse Archers are a bitch to fight
[1:59:04] <%DensityD> they do both sleep positions
[1:59:07] <%alexandrecau> @DensityD dokapon
[1:59:12] <KitsuneManami> @WoolieVersus He was lying down for your Pillow~
[1:59:19] <%rottingpastry> They can sleep standing up. Don't have to.
[1:59:28] <PanicSwytch> Any horse owners confirm?
[1:59:30] <+gnoame> Most baby animals can run real quick
[1:59:32] <%cobalt_phoenix_> a lot of baby animals can walk early
[1:59:39] <EVOriginal> They only lay down for a couple of hours at most though.
[1:59:42] <KitsuneManami> and Dogs! can't look Up
[1:59:45] <Prevot> dogs can't look up
[1:59:57] <DonatelloJose> Foal
[1:59:58] <heartlesshealer> they're able to sleep standing up, so people pen them into smaller places than other animals relative to their sizes
[2:00:02] <sonofthedeepsouth> dogs like to lick their dicks
[2:00:09] <%DSD24> That's the good shit
[2:00:15] <T_Sasquatch> Deer and gazelle fall out the vagina from birth and start moving
[2:00:16] <sonofthedeepsouth> oh
[2:00:18] <%DSD24> Height of Hubris
[2:00:25] <Kahpoe_Lelou> when they are tied to a stable they dont have much choice lol
[2:00:25] <KitsuneManami> Scions and Sinners Mihn?
[2:00:30] <Make_me_mad> Horses can nap standing up but to get actual good sleep they lie down.
[2:00:32] <%cobalt_phoenix_> orokin samurai
[2:00:37] <%kekkerscrew> Woolie confirmed not part of the Imperium
[2:00:52] <%rottingpastry> Apparently horses sleep lying down when they need REM sleep.
[2:00:54] <%DSD24> Woolie doesn't like Quatro Bajjena's Gundam cause it has the big GOLD
[2:00:55] <%SaiyanShoto> It looks so cool when its upgraded
[2:01:01] <%alexandrecau> stormtrooper
[2:01:08] <KitsuneManami> wont look so great on the higher lvls
[2:01:09] <jorniev> HAVIK
[2:01:09] <SomeAsianDood> I wish the red symbol was a bit brighter
[2:01:10] <heartlesshealer> mongols are colorblind
[2:01:14] <Aussie_Manny> "Ahh! I'm blinded by his fashion!" D:
[2:01:16] <heartlesshealer> this is the perfect plan
[2:01:16] <KitsuneManami> it becomes TOO MUCH

[2:01:44] <Aussie_Manny> Minh would've been riding out COVERED in reflective silver, blinding his enemies! LUL
[2:01:55] <%alexandrecau> yes he does look baller upgrade that armor
[2:02:08] <Quigsies> Surprised Woolie hasn't started slashing doors yet
[2:02:12] <heartlesshealer> Minh would take no prisoners and grind that exp
[2:02:17] <Reizie_Etherealm> Silver samurai is sick tho
[2:03:02] <theCoolChild> "I heard a rumor?" Allison no
[2:03:02] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:03:03] <RamenRiderZ> "Use your feeble peasant eyes and gaze upon the visage of big money"
[2:03:05] <%doomerskeletor13> I just finished Yakuza 3 the other day
[2:03:12] <Aussie_Manny> And then Yakuza got translated......... when it didn't really need ti.
[2:03:14] <Aussie_Manny> to*
[2:03:19] <%alexandrecau> You're still in a quest now she'll never give you poison
[2:03:25] <SomeAsianDood> Yakuza 3 was the quality dip right? 1,2 were good then 4
[2:03:51] <%doomerskeletor13> 3 is the weakest game in the series but it’s still good
[2:03:52] <Reizie_Etherealm> Divinity Original Sin 2
[2:03:52] <%alexandrecau> 4 was divisive, basically 2 was viewed as the best
[2:04:09] <SomeAsianDood> I started at 4 tbh so
[2:04:14] <RamenRiderZ> Good ol Oblivion npc chatter
[2:04:19] <%alexandrecau> then 0 took the spot and everything else is as long as akiyama is there I won't hate it
[2:04:22] <%doomerskeletor13> @aussie_manny What do you mean it didn’t need to be translated?
[2:04:24] <%SleepyDavid> the witcher 3 has a lot of chatter
[2:04:40] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the last tier still doesn't change the look does it
[2:04:49] <Idon__> Nope
[2:05:32] <%DashXero> The last tier of Sakai armor makes it look sick!
[2:05:53] <Aussie_Manny> @doomerskeletor13 Strictly and personally speaking, I'm okay with stories set in non-English countries not bothering with dialogue translations. Subs are fine. For me.
[2:05:54] <%rottingpastry> I wish the last tier didn't have antlers
[2:06:00] <jorniev> "your eyes look like my kittie" is banter line that I like
[2:06:21] <%alexandrecau> soulja
[2:06:29] <%rottingpastry> Dressup is important
[2:06:37] <%doomerskeletor13> @aussie_manny ...Yakuza is subtitled? That’s what they’re translating
[2:06:47] <Reizie_Etherealm> Still hasn't seen the 3rd level yet has he?
[2:06:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the dressup is half the fun
[2:06:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Reizie_Etherealm nope
[2:07:00] <%doomerskeletor13> Unless you’re talking about the dub 1 one had
[2:07:17] <Make_me_mad> I used the Oni's Blade Straw Hat for basically the entire game.
[2:07:24] <%rottingpastry> Same
[2:07:29] <Reizie_Etherealm> Didn't the white dye merchant sells you one clean white headband?
[2:07:38] <gamewarden92> Fashion of Tsushima
[2:08:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> I liked the 2nd son headband with this armor
[2:08:04] <%alexandrecau> a game let you fast travel mid quest feels so generous
[2:08:11] <%JetpackMcQuack> movie magic
[2:08:18] <Aussie_Manny> With a character that can just sprint everywhere... :P
[2:08:24] <RamenRiderZ> Now Im just wearing the Fear Haiku Headband and [redacted]
[2:08:48] <Aussie_Manny> Not everything is Flight Simulator.
[2:08:56] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @RamenRiderZ ok if it's what i think of that the gg on picking fear haiku for that
[2:08:56] <Make_me_mad> Sacred Mountain Messenger is best mask.

[2:29:58] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it's 2020 so i won't even be surprised if we get t virus at this point

[2:30:09] <%koolaid_kevster> yes you get paid for blood in usa
[2:30:12] <%rottingpastry> You can donate blood and plasma for money
[2:30:13] <Aussie_Manny> Money? That's nuts.
[2:30:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yea but idk the details
[2:30:15] <EVOriginal> Blood and plasma
[2:30:17] <Huntercd> We pay for blood and plasma
[2:30:17] <+arancet> sometimes, often not, maybe a movie ticket
[2:30:20] <%huskarl_zap> it depends if the supply is low
[2:30:22] <Reveresao> suckers
[2:30:24] <+EternalJedi> you CAN get paid
[2:30:29] <+EternalJedi> more just donate
[2:30:29] <+jiggy_snipe> capitalism bro
[2:30:31] <+EternalJedi> *most
[2:30:33] <%SaiyanShoto> My friend would donate plasma for extra cash

[2:30:35] <%eyezehuhh> Blood Money
[2:30:36] <%rottingpastry> Mostly people donate, yeah
[2:30:37] <Aussie_Manny> In Australia, for blood donating, we get a milkshake, and that's it.
[2:30:37] <%alexandrecau> It's America you want shit you pay
[2:30:38] <%Irridium> do they still not let gay/bi people give blood?
[2:30:41] <%cobalt_phoenix_> at schools i don't think you'd get paid
[2:30:44] <+CptnCampy61> We gotta pay to get it too that’s the catch

[2:31:47] <%eyezehuhh> Bi-weekly Blood Pool
[2:31:49] <Aussie_Manny> Your body will replace the blood volume (plasma) within 48 hours. It will take four to eight weeks for your body to completely replace the red blood cells you donated.
[2:31:56] <%rottingpastry> Do it.
[2:32:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> Pause time and eat 50 cheese wheels to regenerate all your blood.

[2:57:27] <+Estuko> Shadow of Mordor/War
[2:57:28] <%DensityD> oh, Shadow of war
[2:57:30] <%doomerskeletor13> Shadow of Mordor?
[2:57:41] <medril07> sometimes they survive
[2:57:41] <+xeros720> wasn't it more about how those weird orc things don't actually die?
[2:57:48] <%DensityD> orcs are simple minded
[2:57:50] <medril07> rediculous things
[2:57:52] <%DashXero> And they show up with prosthetic cranial implants.
[2:57:59] <%Josef_Stryker> Thrak the Cook: Revengeance

[2:58:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> Motherfucker had his severed head bolted back on
[2:58:28] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I bisected an orc one time and he came back as a fucking literal robocop
[2:58:28] <Zayasu> too bad the games plays awful LUL
[2:58:37] <%alexandrecau> now your uncle's family ghosts can see your shame
[2:58:38] <%DensityD> "Now I'm also resistant to your fire attacks Gwa hahahargh hahahharg
[2:58:43] <%kekkerscrew> Shadow of Mordor was so good
[2:59:04] <%alexandrecau> nemesis is great but only thing the gamehas
[2:59:08] <medril07> what about where you can mind break a nemesis orc like ten times and he becomes a gibbering mess?
[2:59:21] <%DensityD> I want WB games to put nemesis system in something else
[2:59:37] <%DashXero> Better game designers could have used the nemesis system.

[3:00:02] <%alexandrecau> unenduring
[3:00:03] <%DensityD> we are all going....
[3:00:10] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I had an orc on my side one time that was afraid of victory, so the instant my side took a keep he would get terrified and sprint off in some random direction
[3:00:10] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:00:14] <heartlesshealer> things that don't last
[3:00:18] <%DensityD> death will quietly come forth
[3:00:18] <heartlesshealer> impermanence
[3:00:31] <%DensityD> let things flow past you
[3:00:34] <%DensityD> I did it
[3:01:00] <ralphfromdk> Sounds female. After I met poison nanny, I thought it was supposed to be her singen. But hey, that's just me
[3:01:01] <medril07> yeesh
[3:01:13] <fruit_pie_the_magician> AND a nemesis who was terrified of the gravewalker, so he would show up, become instantly terrified and run away from me lol
[3:01:18] <%GeneralSCPatton> For Silmarillion nerds, apparently the whole wraith thing making the protag immortal is a huge violation of the will of Eru Iluvatar. Like it should be impossible for a man to be immortal.
[3:01:19] <%DensityD> your haiku makes me so horny, my lord
[3:01:22] <heartlesshealer> unmoving mountains seems out of place, but sure
[3:01:46] <%DensityD> @fruit_pie_the_magician LUL
[3:02:01] <%alexandrecau> he is not immortal, the elf ghost is
[3:02:02] <medril07> lady yuriko, also known as suck machine back in the day
[3:02:02] <ralphfromdk> GeneralSCPatton He is not immortal, he's possesed by a ghost. No ghost, his body goes back to being dead
[3:02:37] <%rottingpastry> Do the second one!
[3:02:38] <ralphfromdk> Meh, this is the last part, it's nice and short
[3:02:39] <%rottingpastry> Pleeease
[3:02:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> I LOVE THIS CHARM
[3:02:49] <medril07> time for a duel
[3:02:50] <jorniev> @generalscpatton technically he is just not dying, right up until ghosts left him, unless that is the thing that it's not allowed
[3:02:51] <%DensityD> The escort mission in my pants is also quite long
[3:02:56] <Afterman_> this is the best quest line in the game
[3:02:58] <%DensityD> if you know what I mean woolieGASM
[3:03:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @WoolieVersus there are ways to improve that chance
[3:03:07] <%rottingpastry> 15% to instakill seems p good
[3:03:08] <%kekkerscrew> Use the charm that doubles the percentage chance
[3:03:10] <medril07> hehe @DensityD
[3:03:27] <ralphfromdk> It will let you do assassination mid combat, so dope
[3:03:35] <%DensityD> be big samurai
[3:03:36] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I actually had to record one part of shadow of war, because some guy showed up and introduced himself, and before his intro cutscene was over he was instakilled IN THE CUTSCENE by a caragor
[3:03:57] <Afterman_> shadow of mordor was amazing
[3:04:01] <%GeneralSCPatton> @ralphfromdk @jorniev I don't know what the fine print on that is. I just know that some people treat the Silmarillion like the bibble, because of all the parallels, and get all fundamentalist angry about things that defy Eru/God.
[3:04:02] <%cobalt_phoenix_> monkaS

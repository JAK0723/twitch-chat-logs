[0:54:12] <%GeneralSCPatton> @venisonboar They showed themselves shoveling a bunch of colored glass fragments when talking about their recycled materials, but recycling colored glass into clear glass requires a fucking factory that eats more energy than the tile will ever produce.

[1:11:40] <+veraverse> Pro tip: Standing in the center of the road allows you to not waist battery. The catch is: Literally just the center of the road, for real.
[1:11:47] <zenith0111> Eventually every shelter and knit will accumulate way more materials then you need
[1:11:58] <worldbrand> They did some tests! They suck!
[1:12:06] <eiightbiitt> if you get recycled materials you can get less than the XL
[1:12:19] <Teyaric> @WoolieVersus The Solar Roadway project was a scam from a low quality idiot who failed miserably to even produce a fake prototype, actually
[1:12:29] <+linSP> what if you build solar roads over solar roads
[1:12:40] <+rareqq> Thanks for the HahaSweat @aishman
[1:12:54] <djazo> the zipline is the best thing that happened to humanity
[1:12:56] <zenith0111> @teyaric So the idea was there just no product
[1:13:12] <%The_Timo> They're pretty permanent
[1:13:13] <MaeMae94> They're VERY durable though
[1:13:15] <@Solidus_113> The rain damage is so slow on roads it barely matters
[1:13:16] <%GeneralSCPatton> Cheer500 Solar roadways wasn't just an idea. It was a huge crowdfunding scam. Their test runs all suck, for a multitude of reasons that made it infeasible from the start.
[1:13:17] <%GeneralSCPatton> GeneralSCPatton's Cheer shared rewards to 10 others in Chat! 
[1:13:19] <+tuchpi> insanely durable
[1:13:22] <Graxe_> Timefall damages all structures
[1:13:28] <Graxe_> Some are just a lot more durable
[1:13:29] <%The_Timo> I played the game over the span of a few weeks any roads never dropped below 50% lol
[1:13:32] <+veraverse> Boomer rain

[1:13:41] <NordicHorseKing> Thanks for the HahaSnowhal @generalscpatton
[1:13:55] <+veraverse> Rain Rain go away, come back another day
[1:13:57] <eiightbiitt> if yo stay in the middle you're on the grid
[1:14:19] <worldbrand> Every single time I see people sharing a "cool idea" that was just a concept by a designer with no sign of an engineer even mentioned, my piss boils
[1:14:34] <+tuchpi> TRUE

[1:17:24] <zenith0111> SpongeBob was proven to give kids learning disabilities :)
[1:17:29] <+theAncopro> you need to pack more so it rests ontop

[1:17:37] <zenith0111> Get rekt SpongeBob Fans :)
[1:17:42] <@Solidus_113> you have to carry other items on your back so the pizza can stack on top of it
[1:17:43] <$AliasofApocalypse> Isn't the pizza gonna be cold?
[1:17:44] <%GeneralSCPatton> FILL PACK WITH OTHER THINGS
[1:17:46] <Solidnick18> auto arrange it
[1:17:55] <R3c0n31> place the pizza last
[1:17:57] <diehard_jack> You need more packages on your back

[1:20:57] <chronoxgp> I put like a fulltime job into this game and beat it quick
[1:21:07] <IndoorSitup> DON'T FORGET THE DIET DR KELP
[1:21:07] <+veraverse> PIZZA TIME
[1:21:08] <zenith0111> I never used roads and beat this game way faster than most
[1:21:15] <Solidnick18> now deliver that pizza
[1:21:22] <+theAncopro> just like real life
[1:21:42] <Solidnick18> bike is fine
[1:21:42] <chronoxgp> I spent an entire day doing standard orders not knowing they were for likes, and I never delivered lost cargo to the correct place LOL
[1:21:45] <Graxe_> Pizza getting cold

[1:22:32] <zenith0111> I loved this game but after getting all the items and stuff there really isn't a reply value :/
[1:22:38] <+veraverse> Ah yes, the good chemicals
[1:22:55] <+tuchpi> oh god
[1:22:56] <+theAncopro> yea good luck with that
[1:23:07] <chronoxgp> yeah mgsV is like being high on crack compared to this slow ass burn
[1:23:14] <%The_Timo> nothing will really happen if you hit a rock at normal speed, only if you're boosting
[1:23:23] <IndoorSitup> My butthole is so puckered right now.
[1:23:28] <+tuchpi> you can drive pretty recklessly and take 0 damage
[1:23:42] <+veraverse> Full speed and with the front will kissing the sky, this is how you deliver pizza
[1:23:43] <%Irridium> could have used the truck. just put the pizza in the back and go
[1:24:05] <zenith0111> @chronoxgp I was actually going to compare it to V since at the end of DS you have so many options most of them are redundant
[1:24:07] <chronoxgp> i gotta be honest i never order pizza directly to my house
[1:24:36] <@Solidus_113> Don't forget to scanner ping the water to make sure it's not too deep
[1:24:37] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1207129758447939586?s=19

[1:25:42] <+veraverse> Peter Parker thanks you
[1:25:45] <chronoxgp> a combination of not wanting to tip and embarassment seeing the same pizza guy every week lol
[1:25:59] <+DecentMilk> @WoolieVersus What do you guys think about the game
[1:26:02] <+tuchpi> OpieOP
[1:26:14] <zenith0111> @chronoxgp Just don't tip 4Head
[1:26:17] <%Irridium> why can't you just eat it and say it can't be delivered
[1:26:19] <speximillian> If you had a Zipline, that would have been instant :3
[1:26:41] <Solidnick18> lotta bridge link
[1:26:43] <chronoxgp> yeah but the same place every week, they'd think i had a crush on them...
[1:26:48] <%The_Timo> There's more than a few of those lol
[1:26:53] <+tuchpi> there's actually people with just their families
[1:26:59] <zenith0111> @speximillian You get Ziplines at such a weird time. You basically get them at the last half of the game
[1:27:06] <$Gehtingsberg> And here we go
[1:27:24] <+tuchpi> @chronoxgp overthinking how much a delivry person cares LUL

[1:32:45] <@Solidus_113> actual bacon slices on pizza aren't great, unless they're properly cut
[1:32:52] <chronoxgp> pizza from the store with veggies is amazing
[1:32:54] <@Solidus_113> I'll take bits over strips
[1:32:54] <+Nomicro4u> Imagine hating on a type of bacon

[1:34:41] <alastorkunn> i eat the pineapple separate from the pizza
[1:34:47] <@Solidus_113> it was all fat and no actual meat on it
[1:34:48] <+Nomicro4u> Do Canadians have stuffed crust pizza?
[1:34:50] <chronoxgp> @alastorkunn yep
[1:34:53] <zenith0111> Pineapples little numb and kill your tastebuds
[1:34:56] <Djinnazz> why is he ditching th bike?
[1:34:56] <eldragon_1> I love pinapple and pepperoni
[1:35:03] <+tuchpi> @nomicro4u yeah of course
[1:35:07] <worldbrand> i can understand that pineapple is one of those ingredients that taints it if you dont like it, you can't just take it off. kinda like pickles.
[1:35:18] <zenith0111> Liking Pineapple is admitting you have no taste :)
[1:35:20] <+Nomicro4u> Stuffed crust is the way to go
[1:35:21] <%The_Timo> Beef and Blue cheese pizza! Yum
[1:35:25] <LocalRobyn> horrible take from me: if the pineapple is really fresh? ruins the pizza
[1:35:27] <Solidnick18> eh?
[1:35:31] <LocalRobyn> otherwise it's good
[1:35:46] <+Nomicro4u> Meat paste
[1:35:55] <speximillian> Mint is toothpaste

[1:36:17] <+Nomicro4u> Strong genes
[1:36:29] <LocalRobyn> monkaS
[1:36:31] <+Nomicro4u> It tastes like chemicals that you shouldn't be ingesting
[1:36:39] <zenith0111> But what flavor of soap?
[1:36:39] <%This_is_Marco> ah
[1:36:56] <+Nomicro4u> If you overcook the cillantro you can start to taste what everyone else tastes
[1:37:01] <%This_is_Marco> I can cilantro raw, I dont know why I love that stuff
[1:37:02] <LocalRobyn> ah, you are soap eater?
[1:37:20] <worldbrand> i like spinach raw but usually cannot stand it cooked
[1:37:44] <LocalRobyn> weird, opposite for me
[1:37:44] <StarkAvKnark> I see your dislike for pineapple pizza and raise you the swedish pizza with curry, chicken, banana and peanuts
[1:37:51] <%Lion_kun> Yoy should just spend time offscreen grinding them out.
[1:37:53] <alastorkunn> can you guys eat bland broccoli with nothing else
[1:38:07] <%Lion_kun> Grind em out.
[1:38:08] <worldbrand> if it's steamed, maybe a few bites
[1:38:10] <LocalRobyn> my god
[1:38:11] <%Irridium> just gotta keep delivering to them through side mission/delivering lost cargo
[1:38:11] <blaggablag> Two stars gets them in the network I think
[1:38:11] <Teyaric> Connection is a flat out "How many deliveries" mechanic.
[1:38:16] <+theAncopro> each time you deliver to them
[1:38:28] <%wirblewomble> raw broccoli maybe, raw cauliflower is a no go
[1:38:34] <%Lion_kun> Also some connections are lockes until you get an email.so be careful if they dont rise.

[1:40:16] <+theAncopro> canada is the fog door to Alaska
[1:40:22] <alastorkunn> australia doesnt exist right? 🤔
[1:40:30] <eldragon_1> Gotta learn that Animaniacs song about the countries
[1:40:46] <worldbrand> nah that's new zealand that doesn't exist, there's a subreddit about maps with new zealand missing
[1:40:49] <@Solidus_113> New Brunswick fucks everyone up
[1:40:56] <%Lion_kun> Isn't this the same premise as Steel Ball Run?
[1:41:27] <alastorkunn> do you have to find jesus's body parts in this game
[1:41:32] <Teyaric> Kojima REALLY doesn't like automation in his heart of hearts, doesn't he.
[1:41:45] <+tuchpi> @lion_kun no LUL
[1:42:10] <%Lion_kun> No but you have to go across America making connections with people
[1:42:10] <blaggablag> They give crap points tho. If you want to level up these guys you're better off going in person.
[1:42:19] <Solidnick18> i hardly used the bots

[2:26:34] <@Solidus_113> blood kills the wandering BTs, you can also use the bola to just restrain them so they can't chase

[2:33:37] <%GeneralSCPatton> Cheer500 BTs have pseudo i-frames against consecutive blood nades, so you've been wasting them without doing damage. I think you need to wait until the bloodstain clears from their body. Therefore, cook the grenades to fill them with more blood and maximize your damage output. And touchpad during boss will summon the ghost that throws extra supplies.

[2:35:55] <Graxe_> Social Eating, though
[2:35:57] <%This_is_Marco> Im disgusted by my own mouth noises
[2:36:00] <katocrimson> Unless it's hot Korean girls munching food

[2:44:02] <mrfreezepunsbestpuns> I didn't think "forgiveness is conditionally bullshit" had the same ring to it.
[2:44:09] <Franklin_Stine> But cities never fix their roads lol
[2:44:13] <ThirdPersonPhil> if the technology needed for it keeps getting cheaper it could be viable

[2:47:42] <%GeneralSCPatton> I swear that spamming nades has never worked for me.
[2:47:46] <+theAncopro> call for help was real tho
[2:47:52] <derap41> Also they
[2:47:58] <+puffinup> woolie vs god begins agaaaaain
[2:48:03] <derap41> 're less grenades and more rocks you need to hit dead on
[2:48:08] <derap41> to do good damage
[2:48:09] <zenith0111> You have to shoot a decent gun through the blood clouds to do maximum damage
[2:48:19] <@Solidus_113> Check out that carrier you just unlocked, they're super useful
[2:48:20] <zenith0111> Makes them blood bullets
[2:48:23] <%The_Timo> You want to hit different locations, when a part of them goes red it won't recieve too much more damage. From my experiences hitting untouched parts or parts that have faded back to black take the most damage
[2:48:26] <NotHereToStream> dammit woolie you need to call for help if you run out of items in a bt hunter fight
[2:48:30] <Angry_Ev1L> what gun fuckers... shut up
[2:48:31] <%The_Timo> yes
[2:48:34] <+paladinstarbuster> YES
[2:48:45] <worldbrand> dont think about it
[2:48:50] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> yep
[2:48:54] <@Solidus_113> Bola has blood in the rope
[2:49:00] <+theAncopro> bola has blood infused in it
[2:49:05] <$LiquidShake83> use it find out
[2:49:07] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> well its mainly a mechanic for the bullets
[2:49:14] <NotHereToStream> you'll find out soon enough
[2:49:14] <%jinking79> NO
[2:49:16] <Tucker0603> @WoolieVersus the bolas has blood wrapped in the strands, it wont do shit against the big doggos
[2:49:20] <millionstabz> But bola is temporary, blood grenade is forever
[2:49:20] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> but it works on bolas too
[2:49:22] <zenith0111> Bola guns do work on BTs
[2:49:24] <StaceMcGate> Has Woolie killed anyone?
[2:49:25] <%GeneralSCPatton> Bola only ties regular BTs
[2:49:26] <Angry_Ev1L> ban chat
[2:49:46] <@Solidus_113> You can use the bola to restrain wandering BTs so they can't chase

[2:52:28] <Tucker0603> time for Tony Hawk!
[2:52:42] <derap41> Those practically triple your capacity

[2:53:36] <Tucker0603> SO HERE I AM!
[2:53:37] <@Solidus_113> It uses like 1 crystal every 5 minutes or so, don't worry about the cost
[2:53:46] <derap41> They cost like nothing
[2:53:55] <Djinnazz> Ignore that last paty
[2:53:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> Basically free
[2:53:56] <+paladinstarbuster> Dont worryy about the crystals though
[2:53:58] <derap41> DOING EVERYTHING I CAN
[2:54:02] <Djinnazz> *part
[2:54:06] <%The_Timo> So avoid mule territories with the carrier
[2:54:07] <zenith0111> You get a lot of Chiral Crystals
[2:54:09] <%The_Timo> or Sneak more often lol
[2:54:10] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Cant chase you when youre Tony Hawk
[2:54:12] <+puffinup> oh my god
[2:54:13] <fatshopjoe3> you can ride it down hills

[2:54:26] <+paladinstarbuster> You can actually float over the goo
[2:54:52] <zenith0111> The cargo stays on surprisingly well
[2:54:56] <@Solidus_113> lvl 1 PCC can make the shelter, only lvl 2 can make the safehouse
[2:55:00] <+theAncopro> it'll come in handy once the 500+kg orders start comin
[2:55:05] <zenith0111> You can jump around and shit and they'll be fine
[2:55:13] <@Solidus_113> put the carrier on the ground and you can put cargo on it
[2:55:21] <Graxe_> Perfect
[2:55:26] <%Irridium> gotta offload the carrier if you want to put stuff in it
[2:55:27] <+berserker_103> offload the carrier
[2:55:28] <millionstabz> Y'know what i mean?

[2:57:19] <+yehdinh> chuga chuga CHOO CHOO
[2:57:21] <Milo_Oda> but he only needs one carrier :/
[2:57:23] <derap41> HOLDING ON TO WHAT I AM
[2:57:28] <%redrins> everything could go wrong
[2:57:28] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1207129758447939586?s=19
[2:57:32] <+berserker_103> can ride the carrier
[2:57:35] <+puffinup> @mayorrev it only breaks if you climb a ladder or rope iirc
[2:57:41] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> outrun the threat
[2:57:53] <+tuchpi> WutFace
[2:57:54] <zenith0111> Not too much tbh
[2:57:59] <%This_is_Marco> Death Stranding, Efficiency the game PogChamp
[2:58:00] <@Solidus_113> check the weather
[2:58:03] <+puffinup> You can definitely do really dumb rock climbing and it'll follow you :P
[2:58:03] <%mayorrev> UH OH
[2:58:07] <derap41> These thing can travel of a 90 degree incline
[2:58:15] <Tucker0603> incoming bitch [redacted] ghosts!
[2:58:24] <%The_Timo> Just take it slow. and only use it for necessaary deliveries or scavenging missions, and check weather and mule territories to avoid stuff
[2:58:36] <zenith0111> Any threat you see disconnect the carrier for less risk
[2:58:42] <mrfreezepunsbestpuns> I'd prefer to get one of those pirates as a companion to haul along with you
[2:58:54] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> You are Big Boss too
[2:59:06] <Tucker0603> its on the carrier
[2:59:32] <@Solidus_113> it doesn't
[2:59:33] <derap41> nope
[2:59:45] <zenith0111> Safehouses cost A LOT of chiral bandwidth
[2:59:46] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> its hovering
[2:59:46] <@Solidus_113> carrier is it's own thing
[2:59:48] <+paladinstarbuster> it floats
[2:59:50] <%The_Timo> Only if it's on your person and not hovering

[3:01:07] <derap41> Looks like one of those 3D printed houses
[3:01:47] <katocrimson> it also has a garage
[3:01:48] <%The_Timo> Safehouses also become Fragile Jump points just to clarify
[3:02:13] <zenith0111> Building more safehouses does help out a lot especially online since players can stock up safehouses for you
[3:02:29] <%mayorrev> ROAD TIME
[3:02:31] <NotHereToStream> you can craft too, but you need to deposit materials into the terminal
[3:02:33] <%mayorrev> PogChamp
[3:02:39] <%mayorrev> oh it's a house
[3:02:47] <@Solidus_113> They cost a lot of bandwidth
[3:02:50] <%The_Timo> There's a lot more resources to come, they introduce them slowly, this is now another resources you can collect

[3:21:46] <Tucker0603> YEYEYE
[3:21:47] <Angry_Ev1L> it's not dejavu it's cowardice
[3:21:51] <derap41> Carries are great for saving on shoe wear
[3:22:06] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> they did a rad 99 red balloons cover
[3:22:06] <%ChoculaUltra> MGS2 Substance and Subsistence had those skating the plant minigames - Kojima been about that sk8 life for a minute.

[3:26:07] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> woolie it shows you if theyre knocked down or not
[3:26:08] <+Prevot> he still doesn't understand the symbols
[3:26:16] <derap41> Free knockouts
[3:26:20] <+GarbageNirvana> Headshots are instant KOs btw
[3:26:27] <zayasu> so if you bola twice you dont have to kick them?
[3:26:31] <Tucker0603> strand time

[3:26:57] <%Irridium> stars they're done, chains they're not

[3:26:59] <ThirdPersonPhil> pick these loose cargo to hit people with
[3:27:03] <@Solidus_113> stars are KO, circles are stun
[3:27:05] <shozent> More coming over the hills
[3:27:15] <%The_Timo> grab the truck, fill it up and pillage their postboxes
[3:28:09] <@Solidus_113> You really only need the 1 carrier, unless you're going to use the 2nd to ride
[3:28:21] <%The_Timo> throw it away lol
[3:28:24] <Tucker0603> drop it
[3:28:30] <Tucker0603> toss the gun away
[3:28:32] <Djinnazz> yup
[3:28:34] <@Solidus_113> private room reloads
[3:28:34] <derap41> Guns are single use
[3:28:36] <pi_in_the_sci> GO TO BED TO RELOAD
[3:28:44] <%The_Timo> No you get more ammo if you rest at a private room
[3:28:46] <NotHereToStream> ammo can be replenished in private rooms
[3:28:55] <BronzeTacosOW> I believe if you rest in a private room it will reload that weapon
[3:28:56] <ThirdPersonPhil> there might be free bola guns on the postbox right?
[3:28:56] <@Solidus_113> But the gun remains damaged
[3:29:07] <Tucker0603> only private rooms can reload
[3:29:11] <%The_Timo> Yeah mules have bola guns in storage constantly
[3:29:13] <Tucker0603> STRAND PARRIES

[3:29:47] <katocrimson> does woolie know about R2 L2 tackle
[3:30:02] <derap41> yep woolie still can't parry
[3:30:06] <mrfreezepunsbestpuns> is that a sock?
[3:30:17] <+PeanutJesus> It's his cumsock
[3:30:18] <derap41> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[3:30:23] <+linSP> use the bumrush
[3:30:39] <BlueEyesWhiteFatass> just start pissing bro
[3:30:40] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> CLOCKED
[3:30:55] <%GeneralSCPatton> CAN'T PUNCH ARMOR
[3:31:03] <@Solidus_113> SWING FIRST
[3:31:16] <+PeanutJesus> Holy shit they actually picked up some stuff
[3:31:16] <+GarbageNirvana> They really want that underwear
[3:31:28] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> CLEARED
[3:31:29] <$LiquidShake83> steal it all
[3:31:35] <Tucker0603> TRUCK TIME
[3:31:38] <NotHereToStream> nice, grab the memory chip in one of the camp if you want to feel COOL
[3:31:41] <derap41> Sam is a street fighter beast
[3:32:24] <BlueEyesWhiteFatass> HEAVY DUTY UNDIES
[3:32:31] <derap41> Lot of leather
[3:32:36] <worldbrand> training weight undies
[3:32:39] <+puffinup> sam has an entire postal service moveset
[3:32:39] <derap41> with metal
[3:32:42] <BronzeTacosOW> HIGH PERFORMANCE
[3:32:57] <@Solidus_113> Battery getting low, could build a generator around the timefall farm
[3:32:57] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:33:00] <OldManDeckardCain> hopes and dreams sure are heavy Kappa
[3:33:23] <derap41> first truck?
[3:33:27] <%The_Timo> nah
[3:33:31] <%The_Timo> he's had a truck before
[3:33:34] <Tucker0603> cant cause arriers
[3:33:40] <derap41> ah dammit
[3:33:47] <autcetera> One thing I hate about this game is how Kojima acts all deep then says "haha, the older fat lady needs metric tons of undies, go do it Sam Reedus"
[3:33:55] <derap41> always nice seeing someone get a truck the first time
[3:33:58] <Infinit_Phoenix> if your pee is represented with red consult your doctor
[3:34:27] <Tucker0603> attach it to you first
[3:34:28] <+linSP> my love is like a truck
[3:34:29] <derap41> Its not attached
[3:34:34] <Tucker0603> game is glitching
[3:34:49] <+Javaa01> When the carrier isn't hooked up to you, it counts as being discarded on the ground
[3:34:55] <@Solidus_113> if you still had the carrier attached it would be there
[3:35:00] <BronzeTacosOW> carrier wasnt connected
[3:35:18] <MrKerb> What episode is Woolie in?
[3:35:26] <%The_Timo> it was on the carrier, and the carrier wasn't connected to you so it's not listed
[3:35:40] <BronzeTacosOW> ^^
[3:35:44] <autcetera> agreed, something was up
[3:35:51] <Fujiwara_92> But the carrier wasnt on you wool
[3:36:20] <Tucker0603> dude dont run over them, it might kill them and make more BTs
[3:36:25] <@Solidus_113> it doesn't
[3:36:37] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> STEAL THEM ALL
[3:36:38] <@Solidus_113> These trucks can't kill
[3:36:39] <%ChoculaUltra> I've tried to break the game by kiting MULEs to BT territory to trigger a voidout with someone other than Sam - no dice :(
[3:36:41] <@Solidus_113> I've tried
[3:36:50] <Tucker0603> oh thank god
[3:37:02] <NotHereToStream> I saw videos of porters walking into bt areas and getting VO
[3:37:02] <%Irridium> ah so they're like the arkham city batmobile
[3:37:02] <blaggablag> It does give you a TON of time to carry them to the incinerator tho
[3:37:03] <+Flambage> @WoolieVersus Woolie agrees you should beat up mentally ill people
[3:37:07] <Infinit_Phoenix> you take blood damage if you try to run concious mules over
[3:37:16] <@Solidus_113> It takes 48 actual real life hours for a proper corpse to decay if you kill them
[3:37:24] <+dmtjinni> LUL
[3:37:27] <blaggablag> You really have to try to voidout
[3:37:27] <Tucker0603> last thing we need is a conga line of bitch [redacted] ghosts following him
[3:37:28] <+puffinup> YEYEYEYEYE
[3:37:33] <derap41> Same with rapeman the guy that stopped rapists then raped them
[3:37:40] <+Razputin217> woolieVS
[3:37:42] <Fujiwara_92> LUL LUL
[3:37:47] <+PeanutJesus> rapeman origins
[3:37:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> KILL 'EM, RESURRECT 'EM, AND KILL 'EM AGAIN!
[3:38:22] <Tucker0603> Jesus would do sick cross combos on those bitches
[3:38:22] <StarlitStunner> “That shits pretty wizard” - Jesus Christ rravSip
[3:38:24] <blaggablag> Repatriate them for the sheer thuggery of it
[3:38:33] <@Solidus_113> use the pings
[3:38:34] <Fujiwara_92> ALL RIGHTS
[3:38:36] <NotHereToStream> the base has a cool memory chip that makes you feel ccool
[3:38:49] <@Solidus_113> there's a postbox on the left
[3:38:52] <+PeanutJesus> Dude this stuff looks so good
[3:38:55] <derap41> Trucks can hold so much its crazy
[3:38:58] <+dmtjinni> DS is sooooooooo comfy I hope woolie never quit trucking
[3:39:12] <+heyitsdenzel_> all the mules like "i'm coming back"
[3:39:17] <+PeanutJesus> Can't wait to play this on pc
[3:39:37] <%The_Timo> Always check for memory sticks
[3:39:42] <derap41> its right there
[3:39:46] <+BrunoDup> There's a chip in there
[3:39:47] <derap41> blind
[3:39:51] <%ChoculaUltra> there's some asshole named "HiggsWasRight" who leaves ladders and ropes that lead to straight death drops. It's both hilarious and angering, at least for my sessions.
[3:39:52] <@Solidus_113> NotLikeThis
[3:39:52] <%The_Timo> There's 1 in every mule camp
[3:40:02] <blaggablag> And then 1 in every cave
[3:40:02] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1207129758447939586?s=19
[3:40:05] <peachy996> What a hero
[3:40:10] <NotHereToStream> there is a memory chip in the other on nearby, you definitely want that one
[3:40:10] <@Solidus_113> There might be a memory chip on the roof
[3:40:11] <@Solidus_113> I forget
[3:40:30] <derap41> Its about sending a message reggie
[3:40:34] <@Solidus_113> they have their own icon
[3:40:44] <+Javaa01> Guns are actually really valuable in terms of materials when you recycle them, considering their weight and volume
[3:40:46] <+berserker_103> I hated this section
[3:41:04] <+Javaa01> So even an empty gun is worth to take, if you need the materials
[3:41:19] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> lol its just making the world feel lively by implying other porters are driving by
[3:41:56] <blaggablag> I hate mule trucks they have the shittiest trunk
[3:42:11] <derap41> Run them down
[3:42:16] <%The_Timo> Woolie look for the memory chip! D=
[3:42:18] <+puffinup> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli there are literally porter npc's lmao
[3:42:27] <@Solidus_113> I swear you've seen this before
[3:42:35] <%The_Timo> he must have, it's in every mule base lol
[3:42:36] <OldManDeckardCain> woolie's memory LUL
[3:42:37] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @puffinup yeah but you wont see them driving
[3:42:39] <derap41> That tech is to good for mules
[3:42:44] <ThirdPersonPhil> i remember when Frodo did that
[3:42:50] <BronzeTacosOW> lol
[3:42:54] <autcetera> @woolieversus How do you feel about the guy whose leg was destroyed by a shotgun booby trap when he was trying to burglarize them? The owners were convicted of unusual punishment
[3:42:56] <+GarbageNirvana> That's some military shit
[3:43:16] <peachy996> Burglar deserves it
[3:43:26] <%The_Timo> resin still maters if you want to build other shit later lol, but this small amount means nothing
[3:43:39] <derap41> @autcetera Pretty sure making booby traps are illegale like even non lethal ones
[3:43:51] <+rickieplus> life of a postman is no joke
[3:43:59] <blaggablag> @WoolieVersus Wool you can literally grab these in your hands and put them in the trunk without entering menus
[3:44:06] <autcetera> @peachy996 I highly recommend reading the court summary. Both sides brought up good points. Lethal traps are widely illegal for a reason
[3:44:12] <blaggablag> It's arguably faster sometimes
[3:44:13] <Djinnazz> That's if they're running away
[3:44:25] <+GarbageNirvana> Stand your ground laws differ from state to state
[3:44:28] <NotHereToStream> can't you just lie and say they were threatening you
[3:44:29] <Djinnazz> if he tyrns his back while aiming, you're good.
[3:44:31] <katocrimson> However dead men tells no tales
[3:44:35] <autcetera> @derap41 I'm talking about the precedent setting case
[3:45:10] <+PeanutJesus> Reggie wants to know how to legally get away with murder
[3:45:12] <peachy996> @autcetera It sounds like both sides deserved it to me, burglar hops on one leg now and the house owners aren't rigging Jigsaw level booby traps
[3:45:26] <Fujiwara_92> The pov of the streets LUL
[3:45:37] <+linSP> in some places its illegal to fight back in self defense
[3:45:58] <@Solidus_113> you can just drive what you have to the farm and recycle it all
[3:46:01] <@Solidus_113> it's so close
[3:46:02] <Djinnazz> that makes no sense
[3:46:03] <derap41> @autcetera Basically placing a booby trap means you aren't aware of whos going to trigger it that makes it illegal as for moral yeah fuck that burglar
[3:46:12] <+GarbageNirvana> All I know is someone comes into my space they gettin clapped
[3:46:13] <peachy996> Some people see a self-defense law and go extra with it
[3:46:53] <derap41> @GarbageNirvana You're gonna want some Penicillin for that
[3:46:55] <Fujiwara_92> Attache case with strands
[3:46:56] <autcetera> @linsp Are you sure? I would understand if it were illegal to fight back "disproportionately," like snap the neck of a pickpocket
[3:46:56] <@Solidus_113> they are honestly
[3:46:57] <NotHereToStream> hoarding fucks with my mind goblin
[3:46:58] <+theAncopro> metal and ceramic does build roads~
[3:47:10] <LoveYouDead> u're telling me i can't do a fatality for self defense ? hmmm
[3:47:10] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:47:11] <@Solidus_113> drop a carrier
[3:47:13] <+rickieplus> building roads in central is op
[3:47:14] <%GeneralSCPatton> Anchors are 3-packs, so you don't need that many
[3:47:23] <+rickieplus> i just make my big deliveries and collect ranks
[3:47:25] <%Irridium> you could take out your carriers and just walk to the farm
[3:47:44] <+theAncopro> also timefall is like right there you can come back in a sec
[3:47:47] <%GeneralSCPatton> @loveyoudead Soulnado is considered excessive force
[3:47:49] <@Solidus_113> drop the XL and L stuff
[3:47:57] <@Solidus_113> smalls aren't going to help
[3:48:03] <Fujiwara_92> XL alloys
[3:48:10] <derap41> @autcetera if they can establish that you where no longer under treat then its excessive this is why in a fight you don't kick people that are down
[3:48:12] <joylent_blue> LUL
[3:48:13] <Djinnazz> woolieTRASH
[3:48:17] <@Solidus_113> you can come back for it all in like 2 minutes
[3:48:20] <Tucker0603> I have no qualms about stabbing a bitch if they come at me or my loved ones. As a person who lives in NH(which has no knife laws) I always have a knife on me
[3:48:26] <joylent_blue> let reggie sing BibleThump
[3:48:28] <Fujiwara_92> LUL LUL do it reggie
[3:48:30] <peachy996> If you don't let it go, you need to hold it
[3:48:41] <+linSP> i always wanted to smack a mule with a container of 1000 metal
[3:48:44] <%The_Timo> those resources are so abundant and you can get them whenever lol
[3:48:45] <@Solidus_113> drop the XL Special Alloys
[3:48:56] <+puffinup> reggie just tossin those lyrics left and right
[3:48:56] <ThirdPersonPhil> if you really want it all you can just come back and get it
[3:48:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> Hoarding go up
[3:49:02] <blaggablag> Your priority at this point in the game is metals and ceramics
[3:49:03] <@Solidus_113> NotLikeThis
[3:49:03] <autcetera> There will always be more raw materials
[3:49:10] <%Irridium> you could have just driven to the farm, delivered/recycled, then come back
[3:49:16] <DHB05> is @WoolieVersus playing the UPS simulator?
[3:49:21] <blaggablag> Cause you want them roads
[3:49:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie is Greed
[3:49:22] <chronoxgp> wtf..
[3:49:29] <zenith0111> caleb5H Big Brain plays caleb5H
[3:49:30] <@Solidus_113> you can come back for it in like 2 minutes, they're not going to disappear
[3:49:42] <+linSP> yea mule trucks have the lowest truck capacity
[3:49:43] <blaggablag> They literally are tho
[3:49:55] <+heyitsdenzel_> i'd store those in a private locker for later
[3:49:55] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Not only can you come back for it, these dudes will all stay asleep
[3:50:14] <%The_Timo> Once you get too far away from it
[3:50:15] <blaggablag> After a certain distance your dropped stuff becomes "fair game"
[3:50:19] <derap41> yep
[3:50:20] <+rickieplus> i go around and collect lost cargo it's fun
[3:50:22] <autcetera> Other people can pick up if you get too far away
[3:50:29] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I literally loaded 3 full trucks once and just ran back for each truck
[3:50:34] <%The_Timo> not those trucks, if you leave built vehicles they will
[3:50:35] <+rickieplus> i found some gold power skeletons last nite
[3:50:45] <@Solidus_113> BEER
[3:50:49] <autcetera> @rickieplus bruh nice
[3:50:54] <Tucker0603> time for adam jensen
[3:50:58] <+rickieplus> dude it's crazy what gets lost out there
[3:51:09] <+rickieplus> i almost lost my truck w like 3k metal in it
[3:51:10] <blaggablag> Remember to bump your truck to the door if you want the stuff to be 100% sure to get picked up by the facilities
[3:51:29] <zenith0111> woolieLORE_HF woolieLORE_HF woolieLORE_HF woolieLORE_HF woolieLORE_HF
[3:51:32] <+theAncopro> also wool you should check behind the farm
[3:51:37] <derap41> Some weak seeds
[3:51:54] <NotHereToStream> don't forget to get the memory chip in the camp nearby, you NEED it
[3:52:03] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I once killed my truck battery crossing a river, got exactly halfway and stalled out with like half a mule camp in the back
[3:52:15] <Tucker0603> it's adam jensen, HE NEVER ASKED FOR THIS
[3:52:23] <derap41> Oh shit it is him
[3:52:33] <+rickieplus> @fruit_pie_the_magician hard times out there u_u
[3:52:34] <blaggablag> Gah it hurts every time he does that
[3:52:36] <zenith0111> @fruit_pie_the_magician I once got my truck stuck in a small river it now acts as a bridge LUL
[3:52:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> @solidus_113 Is cargo being 'lost' based on time or distance? I thought that as long as you stay in range and don't sleep, logout, etc. it'll stay.
[3:52:43] <fruit_pie_the_magician> and it was so far from shore that i couldn't even build a generator close enough to recharge
[3:52:46] <+theAncopro> there is chiral poisoning tho
[3:52:49] <@Solidus_113> distance is the fastest
[3:52:55] <+Javaa01> Except he totally did, cause the network is cool and totally not sinister or anything
[3:52:56] <ThirdPersonPhil> you have to worry about the apocalipse
[3:53:05] <%GeneralSCPatton> YOUR SOUL IS GETTING CANCER
[3:53:11] <@Solidus_113> if you drop something at lake knot it'll be gone when you reach the distro center
[3:53:12] <Tucker0603> SCAN PARRIES!!!!
[3:53:13] <blaggablag> Is this farm like, the entirety of texas?
[3:53:14] <katocrimson> yeye ping parry
[3:53:16] <BronzeTacosOW> oh Mama
[3:53:17] <+theAncopro> more PARRY
[3:53:21] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> ANTIPING

[3:54:27] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:54:30] <autcetera> what even is voice acting
[3:54:33] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> wow thats Elias Toufexis
[3:55:16] <@Solidus_113> halfway through chapter 3 maybe
[3:55:24] <derap41> 50 kg of anti matter is enough to completely destroy I'm talking vaporize here
[3:55:39] <@Solidus_113> truck too far away
[3:55:57] <+linSP> only eat 1g of antimatter per meal
[3:56:05] <autcetera> truck range should be the whole camp imo
[3:56:07] <+Javaa01> Just ram it in the doorway, that tends to be close enough
[3:56:19] <%ChoculaUltra> rip the grams
[3:56:35] <zenith0111> Those holograms poor feelings :(
[3:56:45] <BronzeTacosOW> thank god you can now dismantle vehicles
[3:56:47] <peachy996> Holograms don't have feelings
[3:56:54] <%unrolls> unrolls subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:56:59] <peachy996> Ask the EMH in Voyager
[3:57:13] <NordicHorseKing> Thanks for the HahaTurtledove @unrolls
[3:57:14] <+linSP> i almost ran into porters on multiple occassions
[3:57:47] <%Irridium> no keep the crystals
[3:57:47] <@Solidus_113> you don't really need to recycle them
[3:57:48] <+Javaa01> Nah, keep the crystals on you
[3:57:49] <zenith0111> Luckily running over someone prioritizes knocking them out
[3:57:51] <%The_Timo> You need some to power the carrier and some to build
[3:57:53] <@Solidus_113> only if you're going to craft something with them
[3:57:57] <%The_Timo> and some to make roads
[3:58:05] <zenith0111> I took out a whole camp just running them over and knocking them out
[3:58:09] <blaggablag> You can carry as many as you want and just dunk em on the thing whenever you need to fabricate something
[3:58:15] <%GeneralSCPatton> @linsp I bola'd one off a ladder into a ravine because I thought he was a mule.
[3:58:36] <autcetera> basics == 70 grenades LUL
[3:58:46] <@Solidus_113> you don't need 9 climbing anchors
[3:58:51] <zenith0111> MULE boots DansGame
[3:58:59] <%Irridium> could recycle the pcc lvl 1's too, since all the stuff they build are in lvl 2's
[3:59:04] <blaggablag> I don't think I've needed 9 climbing anchors in the entire game
[3:59:26] <zenith0111> No point in climbing anchors and ladders if you plan on driving
[3:59:28] <derap41> Never enough guns
[3:59:32] <@Solidus_113> keep a PCC to build a generator around the farm
[3:59:52] <BurdRightsActivist> Drop everything into the share box for MAX LIKES
[3:59:55] <%GeneralSCPatton> Anchors are 3-packs
[4:00:10] <autcetera> @zenith0111 Ladders can actually save your trike, but otherwise yeah
[4:00:40] <@Solidus_113> you have 3 ladders
[4:01:22] <@Solidus_113> really don't need 2 carriers
[4:01:35] <@Solidus_113> they're taking up the most space on your backpack
[4:01:35] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1207129758447939586?s=19
[4:01:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> It is so fascinating to see how different people play this. I always travel as light as possible and just improvise my route based on what I pick up. Only things I load up on are a certain weapon that I don't think woolie has yet so I won't go into detail
[4:02:03] <SideChar> Thanks for the HahaBall @unrolls
[4:02:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> Unless I absolutely KNOW I'll need something, I don't bring it.
[4:02:20] <zenith0111> I found vehicles to be a chore so I hoofed it most the time
[4:02:31] <Djinnazz> give it a 4 count when you see their first ping
[4:02:34] <BronzeTacosOW> @CommanderSqueaks me too, its interesting. I have avoided any streaming of DS until i finished the game as well, for no spoils
[4:02:37] <@Solidus_113> don't run over the stuff
[4:02:40] <fruit_pie_the_magician> i focused entirely on building roads in this area, then trucking
[4:02:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> Vehicles are good when some tool needs 1000kg of stuff.
[4:02:52] <%unrolls> <3
[4:03:02] <%The_Timo> Until ziplines Roads are king
[4:03:04] <zenith0111> I never focused on roads mainly due to me playing offline
[4:03:21] <fruit_pie_the_magician> to fuel roads i would steal mule trucks and loot mule camps, using the magic of slide punching
[4:03:41] <zenith0111> Considering you can beat this game in 5 hours roads are really overhyped
[4:04:02] <fruit_pie_the_magician> strangely i played online but ended up building the roads almost entirely by myself
[4:04:05] <autcetera> @commandersqueaks "some tool" being, like, a city of 20k people
[4:04:12] <%Lion_kun> I've been playing since launch and am only at chapter 5 :(
[4:04:23] <peachy996> a city of tools
[4:04:39] <%Lion_kun> I need to 5 star everbody and build all the roads
[4:04:41] <%Lion_kun> I just need to!
[4:04:43] <+rickieplus> ^
[4:04:48] <zenith0111> @fruit_pie_the_magician It depends on you're relations with the preppers for the amount of other player structures you see
[4:04:51] <%Irridium> same. also the upgrades are dope
[4:04:54] <fruit_pie_the_magician> well yeah, you blow through the fame without spamming speedy deliveries, it goes pretty fast
[4:04:56] <autcetera> @fruit_pie_the_magician same here
[4:05:00] <+rickieplus> finally got the lv 3 truck we lit
[4:05:04] <fruit_pie_the_magician> *game
[4:05:07] <+rickieplus> gonna take it off road i think
[4:05:10] <BurdRightsActivist> RESINS GET OUT
[4:05:21] <Eternal_Nihilism> You'll get it Lion. People go at their own pace. Especially with games like this.
[4:05:27] <derap41> Making America Great Again
[4:05:32] <@Solidus_113> Res-in? more like Res-OUT
[4:05:44] <zenith0111> I already 5 star everyone. So I plan on tearing down all my structures and putting up a bunch of ziplines and postboxes for people.
[4:05:45] <%Irridium> i hope he flipped you off for just driving on his field in front of him
[4:05:46] <BronzeTacosOW> roads are entirely worth it for getting around after you beat the game, especially if you want to platinum the game
[4:05:46] <autcetera> Going too fast through this game will destroy your enjoyment of it
[4:05:59] <BronzeTacosOW> roads and zips are all you need pretty much
[4:06:12] <%Lion_kun> what would you say the hardest trophy of the game is?
[4:06:16] <zenith0111> Fill up all the postboxes with safehouse materials and such
[4:06:23] <derap41> Guessing Zip lines are still completly busted in this game
[4:06:34] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @zenith0111. I'd see lots of structures and get tons of likes, but nobody around me shared my lust for truckin' Haha2020
[4:06:36] <+GarbageNirvana> Oh geez, Woolie said "Hollywood drivers" and my mind immediately went to Michelle Rodriguez
[4:06:41] <BronzeTacosOW> really @derap41 ? never had an issue with htem
[4:06:42] <+rickieplus> i'm gonna drop off lots of postboxes with materials for christmas
[4:06:49] <BurdRightsActivist> @Lion_kun 20+ Legend of Legends for all types of deliveries
[4:06:51] <BurdRightsActivist> It's just a grind
[4:06:54] <autcetera> @derap41 I don't think it's possible to nerf them
[4:07:05] <peachy996> @GarbageNirvana The Tah-ken player?
[4:07:23] <+theAncopro> I'm pretty sure roads only take a percentage of materials from other players, which would be why sometimes you'll see odd numbers
[4:07:31] <@Solidus_113> They're on the other side of a river
[4:07:55] <@Solidus_113> You can get mats pretty fast by raiding mule camps
[4:07:58] <NotHereToStream> the RWNR bike is in a memory chip near the camp
[4:08:01] <zenith0111> @fruit_pie_the_magician Roads are cool but avoid all the cool areas
[4:08:03] <+GarbageNirvana> @peachy996 She loves tekKEN almost as much as she loves hit and runs
[4:08:21] <zayasu> WutFace
[4:08:22] <%Lion_kun> Oh you have to replay the game on hard difficulty
[4:08:24] <%Lion_kun> .....
[4:08:28] <chronoxgp> don't even have to read these, just read the yellow text
[4:08:33] <%Lion_kun> so much for platting this game
[4:08:45] <@SoushinSen> "replay"? you can change difficulty at any time
[4:08:45] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:09:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> Are they on normal or hard?
[4:09:10] <@SoushinSen> they're on normal
[4:09:16] <zenith0111> Hard Mode on this game is a joke LUL the only real difference is timefall effects are greater but that's it
[4:09:22] <+GarbageNirvana> No being a bitch in the apocalypse
[4:09:26] <%Lion_kun> thanks Minh
[4:09:30] <zenith0111> Everything else is minor
[4:09:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> I was about to say, I often forget I am on hard because it is not hard
[4:10:02] <derap41> 10 grams of Anti Matter can destroy a fucking state
[4:10:17] <+rickieplus> lmao
[4:10:18] <zenith0111> @commandersqueaks Once you get the backpack cover it might as well be easy mode LUL
[4:10:19] <@SoushinSen> i have platinum trophy myself, it's not hard, it's just time-consuming.
[4:10:21] <Tucker0603> i have
[4:10:29] <peachy996> Sorry I banged your mom too hard
[4:10:34] <%GeneralSCPatton> Sorry for being ONE GUY that one time
[4:10:42] <chronoxgp> most of them are fluff, the stuff in your journal is what you're supposed to read
[4:10:43] <+theAncopro> keep in mind these sci fi old men are operating on likes and emojis
[4:10:54] <%CommanderSqueaks> @zenith0111 Congrats, you motivated me to end my two week hiatus, I hadn't gotten that yet.
[4:11:03] <+linSP> 👍👍👍👍
[4:11:07] <BronzeTacosOW> yesss POP VIRUS lol
[4:11:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> @generalscpatton One Guy NEVER apologizes.
[4:11:30] <katocrimson> it's a song
[4:11:37] <+Javaa01> So basically he got high on Oxy and listened through an album while tripping balls
[4:11:40] <zenith0111> @commandersqueaks The early preppers in chapter 3 give most of the good stuff
[4:11:58] <+theAncopro> reggies in

[4:16:56] <+PeanutJesus> You literally increase your IQ by playing death stranding
[4:17:08] <+rickieplus> we're technically ludens by retaining information about imaginary worlds you could say

[4:21:26] <%redrins> super worth doing them
[4:21:27] <+rickieplus> man's gotta have his pizza
[4:21:31] <+SpiceMastah> Thanks for the HahaDreidel @sub_zer_0
[4:21:33] <peachy996> girl love her ham
[4:21:35] <+GarbageNirvana> When pizza's on Sam Bridges, you can eat pizza anytime
[4:21:36] <Tucker0603> @WoolieVersus ya gonna wanna do all of these, even if they are a bitch, pizza is an important thing
[4:21:45] <Crashfan01> imagine a world without pizza
[4:21:55] <+linSP> pizza gives the best reward late game
[4:23:13] <zenith0111> Dude pizza delivery is the height of human opulence LUL
[4:23:13] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1207129758447939586?s=19
[4:23:17] <Crashfan01> MULE apologist :(((((
[4:24:07] <Graxe_> Distribute Sam's blood to all corners of America
[4:24:10] <fruit_pie_the_magician> damn there's a lot of mules
[4:24:12] <Graxe_> Who cares if he's just one man
[4:24:26] <autcetera> Peter is my favorite
[4:24:33] <%The_Timo> Peter is pretty good
[4:24:43] <Graxe_> Well
[4:24:54] <Graxe_> There was that one MULE that died
[4:24:56] <%Lion_kun> THE LIKESIN
[4:25:28] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I've accidentally ran over more than a few mules and nobody cared
[4:25:32] <%rytyoung> mmm gimme day LIKECIN
[4:25:36] <%rytyoung> dat
[4:25:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> @fruit_pie_the_magician That doesn't kill them.
[4:25:49] <zenith0111> @fruit_pie_the_magician It prioritizes knocking them out
[4:25:58] <%ChiRithy> ChiRithy subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! When's get into 3rd strike part 2?
[4:26:00] <+Javaa01> Well, as long as all the bits that are supposed to be inside the MULE stay inside them, they're fine enough
[4:26:00] <Graxe_> Drone Syndrome scare
[4:26:06] <Graxe_> Remember Drone Syndrome
[4:26:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> You really WANT to kill people in this game.
[4:26:22] <Hellarussian> the MULEs probably quit from shame after being clapped by a deliveryman with a briefcase
[4:26:39] <+GarbageNirvana> How can we trust the robots to do the hit and runs
[4:26:41] <fruit_pie_the_magician> well that may be. but i really thumped those guys with both sets of wheels and where I come from, that kills you
[4:26:42] <%rytyoung> big plothole
[4:26:48] <+Prevot> woolie just wants gurren lagann
[4:26:52] <+heyitsdenzel_> they came from underground
[4:26:54] <blaggablag> That sounds too logical for Kojumbo
[4:26:56] <worldbrand> that's where the zombombies are
[4:26:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> Tar.
[4:26:57] <prism253> But that's slower
[4:27:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> Never forget the tar
[4:27:03] <zenith0111> @woolieversus Woolie most the knots lead underground...
[4:27:03] <Franklin_Stine> Because if somebody dies in a caveman there is going to be a bigger crater than you want
[4:27:04] <Crashfan01> Sam porter bridges the digger
[4:27:06] <artificiallynatural> but from region to region is pretty heavy on infrastructure
[4:27:08] <Graxe_> Everyone does live underground, but it's faster to go above ground
[4:27:08] <worldbrand> oh that's a good point
[4:27:09] <+theAncopro> cause NUKES
[4:27:13] <+theAncopro> are BAD
[4:27:15] <%rytyoung> fuck fighting BTs underground
[4:27:18] <townzzzzz> what is earthquakes...
[4:27:20] <zenith0111> TUNNEL ACROSS ALL OF AMERICA
[4:27:21] <Franklin_Stine> *Cave in
[4:27:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> "Hypothetical"
[4:27:27] <+GarbageNirvana> Muh Vitamin D tho
[4:27:27] <%GeneralSCPatton> Oh yeah, there's lots of weird ghost tar
[4:27:35] <blaggablag> I mean you don't get to enter the cities either, you don't know how DEEP they actually go
[4:27:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> Tar
[4:27:44] <ThirdPersonPhil> just catapult the bodies of the underground city too
[4:27:55] <Crashfan01> what do we eat underground
[4:27:59] <zenith0111> @blaggablag All you see is Sam going down down and down LUL probably deep af
[4:28:04] <+PeanutJesus> If anybody dies underground, you're stuck underground with a voidout
[4:28:11] <artificiallynatural> overland delivery is cheaper
[4:28:12] <+theAncopro> maybe everyone else has and that why america is like where'd erybody go
[4:28:19] <Hellarussian> Ctrl-C Ctrl-V the beer
[4:28:20] <+linSP> the tar fucks with time
[4:28:22] <Graxe_> The ability to create massive underground passages might not be feasible considering that we just got roads back
[4:28:24] <zenith0111> @blaggablag The knots and outposts have like thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people
[4:28:24] <+GarbageNirvana> We have beer now, all is well
[4:28:33] <NotHereToStream> beer will reconnect america
[4:29:01] <%The_Timo> mainly to grow the hops and wheat i'm guessing,
[4:29:17] <Tucker0603> they are speeding up the grain production
[4:29:17] <townzzzzz> time hopps
[4:29:18] <+GarbageNirvana> Maybe they run it through a filter or something
[4:29:27] <+PeanutJesus> You could probably use timefall to grow weed though
[4:29:49] <+heyitsdenzel_> sam where's your focus
[4:30:01] <blaggablag> @zenith0111 Whenever you walk to a knot city it says the population, one of them is about 80k. What you can see of them in the map would imply they're either incredibly dense, or go down.

[4:33:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> I was a bit sketch about the constant health monitoring cuffs, but when every person becomes a nuke when they die, I can understand wanting to constantly monitor everyone's health.
[4:33:51] <+Prevot> PogChamp
[4:34:24] <Tucker0603> but can it make me a big tittied t-rex girlfriend?
[4:34:31] <+Prevot> no feathers tho, right?
[4:34:34] <+GarbageNirvana> Welcome...to Jurassic Park
[4:34:56] <+paladinstarbuster> @Tucker0603 ABSOLUTELY
[4:35:00] <BurdRightsActivist> Bruh think of the kinda weed you can grow with timefall BrokeBack
[4:35:06] <Franklin_Stine> "You can put your weed in there"
[4:35:15] <%rytyoung> you want a dog? put the puppy in the rain for a second boom there's your dog
[4:35:19] <blaggablag> Interesting tho... you don't see many trees around any more.
[4:35:20] <Graxe_> Problem is that you can't really control when timefall happens or keep its time accelerating properties after it hits something.
[4:35:31] <Graxe_> Not just the ground. Anything.
[4:35:33] <blaggablag> Except on that ONE AREA
[4:35:35] <Tucker0603> @paladinstarbuster YEYEYEYEYEYE!
[4:36:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> @graxe_ That's why the farm wanted to connect to the chiral network, the weather forecasting data is CRITICAL.
[4:36:43] <%GeneralSCPatton> @graxe_ What happens if you levitate the timefall with air jets?
[4:38:19] <Graxe_> You would need a lot of force to lift large volumes of water with just air
[4:38:20] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:38:30] <Graxe_> And that's just to contain it

[4:43:23] <Malikwest11> radiation?
[4:43:54] <%GeneralSCPatton> Add one element to your fantasy or sci-fi, and flesh it the fuck out. Don't add a dozen shallow elements.
[4:44:01] <london_flexing> BIG WRONG
[4:44:12] <+PeanutJesus> Woolie say word
[4:44:48] <gunsrlove> Big Shower Thoughts
[4:44:55] <Graxe_> There are also many different types of salts
[4:45:01] <worldbrand> i... still do not understand the larger point
[4:45:04] <Graxe_> Some are safe for consumption, some not
[4:45:20] <gunsrlove> Sodium is not a salt by itself
[4:45:20] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1207129758447939586?s=19
[4:45:23] <gunsrlove> it is a soft metal
[4:45:32] <Graxe_> Sodium by itself is a highly reactive metal
[4:45:48] <Graxe_> Have you seen those videos of people throwing chunks of sodium metal into water?
[4:46:00] <Graxe_> Potassium is even more reactive.
[4:46:09] <gunsrlove> also known as Natrium, in countries who keep to the accurate table of elements
[4:46:31] <+PeanutJesus> yo I had kfc for the first time and I could not believe how good that shit was
[4:46:38] <gunsrlove> "the symbol for it is Na, LETS CALL IT SODIUM"
[4:46:54] <NotHereToStream> we need to beach to facilitate the stadia

[4:47:54] <+GarbageNirvana> Like those new fossil Pokemon in SwSh
[4:48:14] <Graxe_> And quicksilver was this magical alchemic metal because it's liquid metal at room temp, but it's super poisonous.
[4:48:18] <Graxe_> Because mercury

[4:49:02] <DatAsuna> his motivation is just what every time villain's motivation is tho
[4:49:16] <+GarbageNirvana> Oh, like that one dude in Wakfu
[4:49:40] <malamepos> isnt he only able to turn back time for like 5 seconds
[4:49:41] <+Prevot> that's some Dr Doom shit
[4:49:43] <TheoTTree> Ahhhh you watched that Plague vid too I see
[4:49:43] <DatAsuna> It's more that you like his attitude than his motivation
[4:49:46] <%The_Timo> Sounds like someone needs to watch Dark
[4:49:58] <DatAsuna> cause his "motivation" is super simple
[4:49:59] <Graxe_> I feel like a lot of time travel villains are like this
[4:50:01] <igodex13> what shows is it?
[4:50:09] <blaggablag> that's metathuggery
[4:50:11] <Graxe_> Or have it be part of their motivation
[4:50:12] <dukenux> Yeah, if we working on BTTF rules, no one of the murders matter as long as you go back in time
[4:50:24] <worldbrand> you know what, i think i'd have liked that more

[4:51:02] <gunsrlove> yyyup
[4:51:05] <+DingusMcFadden> Know what I'm saying?
[4:51:08] <Graxe_> "If we kill Davros before the Daleks are created, we can stop them from becoming a threat. And all of it never happened."
[4:51:22] <dukenux> yeah thyme is a pretty versatile kitchen herb Kappa
[4:51:45] <Rixstarian> That
[4:52:05] <Rixstarian> Depends on if Time itself is not resistant to interference
[4:52:14] <if_shes_under_12_i_nut> Yo can't believe I caught a stream!!!
[4:52:44] <+DingusMcFadden> Yeah, but what if every change to an existing time-line merely creates a separate timeline? Everyone else in that original timeline is still fucked.
[4:52:44] <Graxe_> Or if travelling back in time actually sends you to another, but similar timeline

[4:56:33] <DatAsuna> the width of train tracks? roman
[4:56:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> We're going for the Cultural Victory
[4:56:35] <dukenux> I dunno, i think British Empire might've a bigger influence all things considering
[4:56:37] <Crashfan01> Britain never existed
[4:56:37] <DatAsuna> the size of cars?
[4:56:39] <DatAsuna> roman
[4:56:42] <if_shes_under_12_i_nut> Kojenius on the Trump shit
[4:56:43] <Ashenik1> @DatAsuna china as well ?? ;d
[4:56:47] <DatAsuna> the size of rocket part components?
[4:56:50] <Graxe_> Chinese nationalism games?
[4:56:56] <+DingusMcFadden> The morlock empire continues to be the main inspiration of all human civilization
[4:56:58] <DatAsuna> all drive from the romans deciding how big roads were
[4:57:09] <%redrins> literally any empire that conquered like half of the world?
[4:57:25] <gunsrlove> Kojumbius
[4:57:36] <+GarbageNirvana> Can you play the equivalent of Hulk Hogan's theme over it
[4:57:38] <DatAsuna> the greeks and mongols changed the course of history, language and culture for centuries after them too yeah lol

[4:57:51] <$Ralfclogs> nickolBUFF_HF jphPickle nickolBUFF_TK
[4:58:08] <DatAsuna> cultural perhaps, still not quite as big as dislacing the populations of half the world

[5:01:38] <%redrins> "limited"
[5:01:56] <Ashenik1> @dukenux LUL I would argue at the time thats pretty huge influence
[5:01:57] <CazadorDeWulf> It was limited to those regions, it's called context
[5:02:15] <dukenux> At the time yeah, but Woolie was talking biggest influence in history ever
[5:02:19] <if_shes_under_12_i_nut> Woolies been hitting the genius pipe
[5:02:21] <ThirdPersonPhil> you can take people down non lethally
[5:02:22] <DatAsuna> Influencing regions that later colonized half the world
[5:02:26] <DatAsuna> and spread said influence
[5:02:28] <Ashenik1> yeah for sure USA has the biggest

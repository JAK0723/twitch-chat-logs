[0:06:25] <+Graem> Dang. I was hoping to see TFH get some limelight
[0:06:35] <armchairmaster_> I think Woolie needs to rename his series into "Getting OUT of Fighting Games."
[0:06:35] <+GalacticaPhanto> @dygengaur Are we? I mean this was a long time coming but maybe they'll just not do shit like this
[0:06:37] <chambatron> A lot of people are behind evo. Not just mr wiz. if you're cancelling evo you're cancelling a whole crwod of people as well. The best would be for mrwiz to just step down
[0:06:37] <lady0arch> nah. darkest timeline would be these assholes getting away with it

[0:17:16] <Joustar_> This shit is going to get blown up as topic too with the Epstein case also reopening TODAY. pedophilia is going to be the topic for the next few weeks.
[0:17:17] <tusk102> @StaceMcGate oh christ

[0:17:17] <+12char2short> INSTALLED again
[0:17:20] <joylent_blue> T_Sasquatch yes but video game events are unique breeding grounds, seeing as video games attract lots of kid participants
[0:17:23] <+Lord0Mugen> How long before KI leaves?
[0:17:35] <+Lord0Mugen> Capcom wasnt in EVO online anyways
[0:17:38] <+lucaflowe> LMAO DOA, how those core values feeling now Wiz?
[0:17:40] <supercjk333> No ranked matches are true equality
[0:17:40] <HereComestheChief> I know someone who was affected by all of this drama in regards to Smash
[0:17:40] <+gustavozxd> @stacemcgate why's everyone talking about Evo though? I only heard about the smash things
[0:17:43] <%SirGO0SE> :( yeah thats a shit feeling but you worked with the info you had
[0:17:53] <HereComestheChief> To say I’m livid is an understatement
[0:17:55] <%sexdrugsvideogames> it was safe at your place Reggie
[0:17:55] <+lucaflowe> Capcom had two games in the Exhibition
[0:17:58] <Bloogoose> I just wanted to watch Mahvel 2 at EVO FeelsBadMan
[0:17:59] <%gatorafan> @lord0mugen, they were on the event tho (invitationals) and probably had some announcements

[0:18:03] <%StaceMcGate> @gustavozxd President of EVO was accused of child grooming and inappropriate conduct
[0:18:04] <scrublord009> I have had several cases of racism and have seen extremely sexist behavior in tournaments. That's why the whole community thing I never believed it
[0:18:08] <%RadicalWeegee> RadicalWeegee is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to WoolieVersus's community! They've gifted a total of 8 in the channel! 
[0:18:08] <T_Sasquatch> @joylent_blue gotta watch your kids then cuz clearly people were aware of some stuff

[0:18:23] <xxshadowxx416> woolie vs event
[0:18:23] <%sjay449> Thanks for the PrideStrong @radicalweegee
[0:18:24] <%YakumoYomi> Thanks for the PridePog @radicalweegee
[0:18:26] <%ArbyDMC> I got lucky with the Ottawa FGC. I've been involved with them since I was 14 and I never once felt threatened or manipulated by them. I consider all of them friends. And they all weed out the disgusting fucks that occasionally come through. Shoutouts to all the communities that are holding it down out there.
[0:18:27] <Brutalyte616> This is the risk of going out in public with your kids. Be vigilant.
[0:18:29] <%Robot_Nixon_> woolieS woolieT
[0:18:30] <supercjk333> Capcom tried to add resident evil and DMC to EVO but forgot they are fightets
[0:18:30] <%Robot_Nixon_> woolieU woolieF
[0:18:31] <%YakumoYomi> Zero tolerance
[0:18:33] <%sexdrugsvideogames> on the evo site they show KI, TFH, SG andMK
[0:18:34] <skullnaught> Remember how Mr Wizard banned DOA for "core values"
[0:18:34] <%prime_name> Oooohh boy
[0:18:34] <+lucaflowe> TLDR: Wiz is pedo trash
[0:18:35] <joylent_blue> T_Sasquatch exactly, i keep going back to wondering where the f the parents were
[0:18:36] <scrublord009> Top player priveledge is real
[0:18:42] <DaKnightWarrior> this hurts man.
[0:18:43] <+gustavozxd> ooooh Mr Wizard, THAT'S why everyone left Evo, now I get it thanks chat
[0:18:47] <%sexdrugsvideogames> forgot about mvc2
[0:18:49] <T_Sasquatch> @jiggy_snipe 30 year old allegations ?? I'm sorry but that's nuts
[0:18:55] <+Lord0Mugen> The FGC has been having problems with allegations for A LONG TIME
[0:19:03] <%Robot_Nixon_> woolieDATTEBAYO 👎
[0:19:04] <VictorySauce23> so EVO's basically dead now, huh?
[0:19:09] <%zamzoph> allegedly
[0:19:10] <+addie_eels> this reflects a deeper cultural issue within the fgc of toxicity, and it exists against women, nb people, trans people, bipoc, and lots of others. as a fan, it sucks.
[0:19:10] <%sexdrugsvideogames> they should have come clean 30 years ago
[0:19:12] <FacetiousAF> woolz. maybe leave this in for YouTube.
[0:19:14] <skullnaught> and SF throwing Mike under the bus
[0:19:15] <+lucaflowe> Yeah they hyped the fuck out of the champions tournament and now it's dead
[0:19:16] <+logoth_> The Harvey Weinsteins of the world
[0:19:17] <%jiggy_snipe> @T_Sasquatch I haven't read everything but its stuff from the arcade days
[0:19:18] <ooblag> Top actor privilege
[0:19:19] <TyrantBelial> Mr. Wiz also might have requested sexual favours from a child's mom to accept a late entry into smash pools.
[0:19:21] <%SirGO0SE> people need to hear this
[0:19:23] <scrublord009> Power positions make these dudes just do shit
[0:19:23] <supercjk333> woolie as long as ranked matches exist then no one can really enjoy games
[0:19:24] <%JustYudha> is it just one guy or multiple people?
[0:19:25] <+Lord0Mugen> I still cringe at the shit that went on during SFIV when women gamers played at EVO. Like Burn Ya Brah
[0:19:26] <Bennett_Fracture> I got 6k channel points now...
[0:19:27] <@akuda_bar> dog fighting is fine if you're good at football
[0:19:28] <+Rabbitmage> Accusations does not equal guilt.
[0:19:28] <+Lord0Mugen> *Bra
[0:19:30] <Viewtiful_Rose> Evo with mr Wizard is dead maybe not evo as a whole
[0:19:32] <blackjackskellington> @t_sasquatch it’s a little worse than just saying dumb shit on Twitter this time dude
[0:19:33] <%sexdrugsvideogames> fooock
[0:19:33] <%LiquidDinosaur> so ALL the FGC has pedos but Smash has the most?
[0:19:37] <ooblag> Top CEO privilege, etc.
[0:19:38] <aiutare47> @justyudha Whole bunch
[0:19:42] <+lucaflowe> Yeah
[0:19:44] <%prime_name> Has ESPN pulled out yet?
[0:19:44] <the_Deadpan_Man> this is the FGC's darkest hour
[0:19:45] <2tailedd3rps> thelur3Hi x2tail1TailyCute
[0:19:46] <+Zenryoku21> that political dodge by woolie lol
[0:19:47] <morningmoondude> it's getting caught on FGC now because FGC is poverty compared to institutions that can easily hide their rampant pedophilia
[0:19:47] <%JustYudha> oh jeez
[0:19:50] <Joustar_> Top player privilege is prevalent in all fields. Saw that shit firsthand as well in my college days, I detest shit like this.
[0:19:52] <%dieselssb> do we need to make a fighting game woolieGIRLS
[0:19:53] <yuribo26> Sajam, Tasty Steve
[0:19:54] <+heroicspiritavenger> EVO IS FUCKING DEAD CRAB RAVE TIME

[0:20:06] <Solidnick18> yeah
[0:20:10] <yuribo26> Hey guys, lets not meme about pedophilia, how about that
[0:20:11] <+TheOneCalledRock> we need more max's FeelsBadMan
[0:20:12] <nicversus> Yeah people look at gaming scenes as being like... separate from the "real world" and that there's no consequences for this shit, but that's not true. This isn't high school. Real shit has real consequences.
[0:20:13] <+lucaflowe> Easy for sick fucks to get their jollys
[0:20:13] <scrublord009> Cancel Evo this year
[0:20:14] <%jiggy_snipe> oh well, 2020 was not at true EVO anyway
[0:20:14] <uncledoodsauce> so can we cancel druckman now and ban sales of last of us 2 already for dmca claiming everyone who hates the game?
[0:20:15] <VictorySauce23> Netherrealm and Capcom has pulled out
[0:20:15] <%JustYudha> That's fucked
[0:20:18] <Ultimatefool> Tasty Steve is too good man

[0:20:39] <+lucaflowe> Capcom had two games
[0:20:41] <Aydarkzero> whoops
[0:20:41] <+fizzguy47> Will EVO die from this?
[0:20:42] <%Invlux> let's show everyone the shortcomings of fighting games! uhoh. uhoh
[0:20:42] <supercjk333> Evo is nothing but projectiles
[0:20:42] <+Lord0Mugen> EVO is dead. Dead Forever
[0:20:42] <%gatorafan> rip the Rollback Netcode showcase
[0:20:44] <+lucaflowe> Both Exhibitions

[0:20:48] <2tailedd3rps> had no idea what happened to EVO, thanks chat prince312Cry
[0:20:52] <%ggbhtg> Skullgirls will never be a real girl....
[0:20:53] <%ArbyDMC> god
[0:20:54] <@akuda_bar> @Rabbitmage I don't think anyone's saying in an official capacity that the accusations are true, but that the validity and the mood in the community is too volatile to run these kinds of events
[0:21:01] <FacetiousAF> the fuckin car crash NotLikeThis
[0:21:01] <%RichardMF_> @facetiousaf evo was still gonna do exhibition matches for the other games including SFV
[0:21:03] <+gustavozxd> this fucking year
[0:21:03] <HereComestheChief> I don’t know if EVO will outright die, but MrWiz gotta go
[0:21:03] <+AgadezXX> even the indie wrasslers and british wrasslers are in a deep cleansing of abusers.
[0:21:05] <GreatestGuess> EVO online would have been way safer than evo in person, ironically
[0:21:05] <%sexdrugsvideogames> 2020 is cancelled
[0:21:07] <%ArbyDMC> 7 months in.
[0:21:07] <+Rabbitmage> Id like to go 1 day without political protests on the internet.
[0:21:07] <%prime_name> Only halfway through...
[0:21:08] <%Anonymasque> I’m so bummed
[0:21:09] <sadboixx420xx> this fucking sucks, dawg
[0:21:10] <DaKnightWarrior> lytOUCH
[0:21:12] <0rond> mankind's hardest year
[0:21:13] <+zeronic64> never redo the past to get to the main stage
[0:21:15] <OkamiDude15> The future refused to change
[0:21:16] <+Lord0Mugen> @akuda_bar The problem is how quick they threw Wizard under the bus
[0:21:19] <%jiggy_snipe> what a start to the 2nd half LUL
[0:21:19] <+iamwood99> we’re only half way thru 2020
[0:21:20] <supercjk333> EVO more like EGO
[0:21:20] <+fizzguy47> God hates rollback netcode
[0:21:21] <%zamzoph> EVO in two days PogChamp
[0:21:22] <Bennett_Fracture> 2020 vision of the future...
[0:21:22] <SheefEatsBeef> what a fucked up thing to happen
[0:21:24] <Mach5Mike> Freaking 2020 man...
[0:21:26] <+lucaflowe> Mr. Wiz is fucking gone if they don't want Evo to die this year altogether
[0:21:26] <+gustavozxd> Keanu Reeves is gonna be outed as SOMETHING bad in December, just to close the year
[0:21:27] <Joustar_> Evo is going to need a rebrand and a half. or at least be gutted, destroyed and something new coming in to take its place.
[0:21:29] <Bennett_Fracture> get it...
[0:21:31] <+Lord0Mugen> @akuda_bar they didnt even miss a beat. INSTANT GONE
[0:21:33] <+heroicspiritavenger> Pat will NEVER get to compete at EVO and that gives me a chub
[0:21:34] <@akuda_bar> fucking relatable, woolie
[0:21:34] <tusk102> @zamzoph why must you cause this pain
[0:21:34] <%arkv01> it all started with kobe's passing man...
[0:21:42] <Brutalyte616> @addie_eels Whoa-whoa. There are assholes in every group. Don't throw the whole community under the bus just because you can't punish something that hasn't happened.
[0:21:43] <+sonicitus> 2020 is a nightmare hellscape
[0:21:44] <%ArbyDMC> It's been a good year for changing things for the better. But god it gets tiring and overwhelming sometimes.
[0:21:44] <DaKnightWarrior> 2020 is so crazy

[0:22:15] <cascadepersona> It's incredibly disheartening, but I'm glad all of these things are coming to light for the sake of the victims and the safety of everyone.
[0:22:16] <supercjk333> hell yeah
[0:22:17] <%LiquidDinosaur> THERE'S ONLY ONE SANE SOLUTION! BLOW IT ALL UP
[0:22:17] <kaine_west> @skullnaught the victims aren't pressing charges

[0:22:25] <shadepman> overwhelming is the word for this year, yeah
[0:22:27] <%Posh_Cat> Remember when 2012 was like “its the end of the world lol “
[0:22:31] <0rond> wasn't Kobe involved in shady things like what's going on right now too?
[0:22:32] <%SmokerWest> This talk is good, but we are still playing video games, right?
[0:22:32] <supercjk333> but more of a third strike
[0:22:33] <sadboixx420xx> BUT ITS NATIONAL SMILE DAY
[0:22:33] <Joustar_> People's bubbles have been disintegrated at this point, and I'm glad it has. Enough is enough.
[0:22:34] <blackjackskellington> Looks like we have the July disaster of this year
[0:22:34] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @zipperdude33

[0:23:01] <T_Sasquatch> Actually that's true. The pandemic is the catalyst for everyone talking alot
[0:23:02] <+heroicspiritavenger> I for one welcome our new post-society society
[0:23:02] <Ultimatefool> Same with LA we still out here
[0:23:03] <sewergator77> Burn the fgc and smash to the ground and rebuild.
[0:23:04] <+Rabbitmage> No one is ever going to be happy again.
[0:23:06] <+gustavozxd> it's still going? Jesus
[0:23:06] <%DatAsuna> I'm actually writing a sci-fi story where that's the key of the antagonistic societies formation. lol
[0:23:10] <+Urdunngurdunn> THEY SHOULDN'T STOP

[0:23:31] <%Posh_Cat> BlackLivesMatter hell Yeah
[0:23:31] <+213372bu> Yeah, nightmarish species extinctions felt like 5 years ago and that was just this year with Australian Fires. All these simultaneous crises has been mentally taxing, in the US Florida has tons of poor people not getting guaranteed money still...
[0:23:33] <TheGershon> R-r-r-record breaker!
[0:23:34] <cascadepersona> On the bright, Australia isn't on fire anymore... I think.

[0:23:34] <+gustavozxd> atpRtsd atpRtsd atpRtsd
[0:23:38] <%Irridium> yeah when people stopped breaking things all the mainstream just stopped covering it. Cops sure haven't quit being bastards too
[0:23:38] <%eyezehuhh> Jesus
[0:23:38] <MattDemers> I hope people realize that how much Twitter/Reddit/Facebook algorithms are influencing their processing of information. That "the protests never stopped!" thought i s a really good point
[0:23:39] <Agami23> yeah it went down during the offline TV stuff
[0:23:41] <sadboixx420xx> oh fuck, we're still in the middle of the plague
[0:23:42] <supercjk333> they never cared about george

[0:23:55] <cham52> The slow and steady Apocalipse
[0:23:56] <Mr_McFries> Its all because of that bastard Dr. Manhatann
[0:23:56] <HereComestheChief> No stopping until the roots get torn out and we can rebuild
[0:23:56] <%YakumoYomi> That's generally what happens with officer involved shootings with racial overtones: the media covers it for a few weeks, and then it's back to business as usual
[0:23:56] <%prime_name> Nah man, you good. Speak your mind.
[0:23:58] <+fizzguy47> QUA-QUA-QUARANTINE BREAKER!

[0:24:51] <+Zenryoku21> @WoolieVersus so how can small FGC venues address current issues in a way that reassures the community?
[0:24:52] <NotHereToStream> Social media is concentrated cancer

[0:27:35] <Deathzone775> did he already address all the fgc ?
[0:27:36] <yuribo26> Jebaited
[0:27:37] <%FuqBoiSlim> ZeRo too? what did he do??
[0:27:38] <Arithmatic> yeah thats a community mod called EX
[0:27:42] <%ArbyDMC> Yeah that mod has been making the rounds lately.
[0:27:43] <%chll0ne> bro cmon
[0:27:44] <%Yomigami> woolieTRASH
[0:27:46] <+mighty_max_t> It's called UMVC3 EX
[0:27:46] <Leafboi125> I'm honestly not surprised anymore
[0:27:48] <Joustar_> @jiggy_snipe thanks, we gave ourselves a year and a half to prepare everything with time but the year just flipped up a lot. Getting back on our feet now though so there's hope :)
[0:27:48] <+gustavozxd> latest hard drive news "it was revealed that YOU, the reader, is also a pedophile"
[0:27:50] <Graxe_> Some are rebalances, some are just goofy shit
[0:27:52] <Arithmatic> its fun, but its not perfect. just breaks the game in a new way Kappa
[0:27:52] <Solidnick18> someone
[0:27:52] <J0j0nes> Eyy!!! It's the good one!
[0:27:54] <supercjk333> you woolie you can make it
[0:27:56] <+logoth_> Someone needs to mod SFV to be fun
[0:27:56] <%zeronic64> wait what did i do
[0:27:58] <Brutalyte616> @woolieversus Have you considered having a Dark Souls PVP LAN party? Because I remember you and Pat talking about it being really technical when latency is not an issue.
[0:28:01] <Agami23> MvC2 was my first fighting game, and MvC3 was the first one i got pretty good at. wish i kept up to ultimate MvC3 but i was a kid
[0:28:06] <+gustavozxd> yeyeeyeyeye
[0:28:07] <Bloogoose> Mod the Infinite characters into UMVC3
[0:28:11] <%DatAsuna> And also replace half the roster
[0:28:17] <%ArbyDMC> Infinite has the UMVC3 models, they just don't have the same lighting/shading
[0:28:19] <%ChrisBardow> I remember seeing an Umvc3 mod that added the infinite tag system on twitter
[0:28:20] <T_Sasquatch> No one cares about infinte that much LUL
[0:28:21] <supercjk333> Woolie to be head of capcoms fighters
[0:28:22] <ZeeJiggle> We should do the opposite and put Infinite's models in 3
[0:28:24] <kumaprime> ultimate alliance 3 models are sexy
[0:28:27] <@Menitta> Whens the Project M of Marvel 3 that adds the MVCI characters
[0:28:32] <Brutalyte616> Of course, that was fucking ages ago...
[0:28:33] <%DatAsuna> Just remove all models
[0:28:34] <Nekros4442> God i miss the Cooptional so much
[0:28:37] <Nekros4442> I miss John
[0:28:39] <%sexdrugsvideogames> so long ago...
[0:28:39] <%DatAsuna> Make function vs function infinite
[0:28:40] <%chll0ne> put alliance 3 in infinite PogChamp
[0:28:43] <alephalpha> honestly just changing the lighting and shaders in ifninite woudl probably help it look a lot betyter
[0:28:45] <%FuqBoiSlim> Model swaps arent gonna give the game an actual unified artstyle if I'm being real
[0:28:46] <@akuda_bar> i think we went down the bad reality when we lost john tbh
[0:28:46] <chambatron> EVO was cancelled twice in the same year before Yandere Simulator finished development
[0:28:47] <+gustavozxd> I would care about infinite if there was anyone I liked as much as max loves strider
[0:28:48] <HereComestheChief> TB...
[0:28:54] <%chll0ne> psylocke is mad thick in alliance 3
[0:28:54] <BoneofMalkav> Remove all models, Replace them with HD Sprites
[0:28:58] <+gustavozxd> like Kamala atpFeelsBeardMan
[0:28:58] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:29:01] <T_Sasquatch> I can't fucking believe infinite released before and not during infinity war
[0:29:02] <%ArbyDMC> Yeah. Infinite's biggest issue with visuals is that it just looks so flat.
[0:29:11] <%SirGO0SE> i dont :) im ready for blow ups
[0:29:20] <@Menitta> Jokes on you, I never knew any combos!
[0:29:20] <alephalpha> risk and reward is fucke dup when one ocmbos doesn't kill

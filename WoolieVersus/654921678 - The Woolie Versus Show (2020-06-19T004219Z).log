[0:17:20] <+agumon9000> @WoolieVersus WOOLIE SHOW HIM KAMEN RIDER KUUGA'S OPEN
[0:17:20] <husbando_speedwagon> this is debatable really
[0:17:21] <+Afterman_> Watch Gekiranger, Kamen Rider Kabuto, Den-O, and Kamren Rider Kiva
[0:17:22] <delta278899> Power Rangers is on Netflix
[0:17:22] <+sonicrulz> they're the same thing
[0:17:24] <Qualityhugeweeb> Kamen Rider W, OOO, Gaim, and Drive are the best. Build is great too.
[0:17:27] <kei_ar_> YES
[0:17:29] <Nicholasgerald1> Lupinranger v Patoranger
[0:17:30] <%trustycoyote> It's a BIG commitment if you wanna tackle Power Rangers
[0:17:31] <+eddyportovs> Gokaiger is such a celebration of the sentai franchise, its sooooo goood

[0:17:47] <@Menitta> Kamen Rider ruined the discord.
[0:17:52] <+GalacticaPhanto> Kamen Rider W, Gaiz and OOO are the shit
[0:17:53] <%ggbhtg> SHOULD YOU BE FOLLOWing TOKU GIFS ON TWITTER?!?! YES

[0:18:27] <husbando_speedwagon> Does Guyver count?
[0:18:32] <%anthonywilde1994> hype
[0:18:37] <%AlteisenReiseZ> If you want Comedy and stuff poking fun at Sentai tropes, watch Akibaranger
[0:18:38] <kei_ar_> YES GUYVER COUNTS

[0:29:18] <Jeemukun> '75 for Super Sentai
[0:29:33] <morningmoondude> Timeranger is good, but a (time)cop procedural is probably not worth a watch right now.
[0:29:34] <kei_ar_> Dino charge has a CANON korean spinoff
[0:29:34] <Jeemukun> lot the early stuff you can watch on shout factory
[0:29:39] <%Pookiedaexzile> Go SPD the one where they made a dreadheaded trapper the red ranger

[0:31:57] <huskarl_zap> psaHoldon psaDown
[0:31:57] <%DatAsuna> Piloted by jack
[0:32:07] <morningmoondude> DinoCharge's first Megazord had big drill
[0:32:11] <+Cobalt_Racer> why not both?
[0:32:13] <%houhilburn> woolieCHAN woolieCHAN woolieCHAN
[0:32:27] <%CaptainPileDriver> so season 28 of power rangers which comes out in 2021 has a weird edgy knights thing
[0:32:28] <+How2BEpic> Remind Woolie to debug this.
[0:32:28] <%dekkitout> Dinocharge or Dino Thunder- or did they both have drills?
[0:32:30] <BackwardCap> A Giant Punchgirl Mech called "The Dread Naught"
[0:32:32] <%CaptainPileDriver> and it looks fucking cool
[0:32:41] <Japanfreak2595> Shinkenger tho
[0:32:47] <%Ghostbody> huh
[0:32:48] <Nicholasgerald1> you should listen to dino thunder it has a banger opening also reggie should watch lupinranger v. patoranger
[0:32:49] <notmediahead> super sentai or kamen rider?
[0:32:50] <arurorablade> time force has a drill
[0:33:08] <%CaptainPileDriver> i know
[0:33:09] <@Solidus_113> It's got crossplay tho
[0:33:10] <arurorablade> depends on the series head
[0:33:11] <ULT_13> power rangers as of late has been sorta lacking in content, sentai has more fun
[0:33:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> i don't have room on my laptop
[0:33:16] <artificiallynatural> FULL CROSSPLAY
[0:33:17] <%gatorafan> Would you be mad if The End of the World made a Megazord with other mechs but got arms in the process? daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:33:19] <@Solidus_113> Not first
[0:33:22] <NathanTZ> Chouju Sentai Liveman is good shit if y’all haven’t seen it yet.
[0:33:22] <Bloogoose> It's nuts
[0:33:22] <@Solidus_113> Minecraft was
[0:33:30] <BalloniWright> STADIA
[0:33:30] <SuperCreeperBlocks> Steam?
[0:33:33] <%ggbhtg> THE GRID IS CONNECTED
[0:33:34] <warmnoid> LUL
[0:33:36] <+roseshrimp> time force spanihs opening its fucking kino. tiempo
[0:33:38] <ULT_13> but I like kakuranger
[0:33:40] <%anthonywilde1994> woooo
[0:33:43] <@Solidus_113> Minecraft and Rocket League did it before
[0:33:43] <BackwardCap> The Stadia version is actually not terrible.
[0:33:46] <%ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus My stream froze as SOON as you said STADIA. CURSED
[0:33:49] <warmnoid> everyone is here
[0:33:51] <%infinite_rotation> Everyone is here
[0:33:59] <NathanTZ> So I could attempt to play against you if I jump on my Ps4?
[0:34:05] <@Solidus_113> yes
[0:34:10] <+TechnoSyndrome> crossplay could make so many niche games thrive for longer with a combined playerpool
[0:34:10] <+TheOneCalledRock> @Solidus_113 with all the consoles? because i remember sony having issues with it at first
[0:34:11] <Azathotic> @ggbhtg Say Stadia three times backwards into a mirror
[0:34:11] <+badjab326> Every game at EA play today had crossplay
[0:34:12] <NathanTZ> Tight!
[0:34:15] <BackwardCap> Unlike SamSho on Stadia, you can play it online.
[0:34:17] <%gatorafan> All it's missing it's the Vita Port Kappa
[0:34:17] <@Solidus_113> There's probably an online option to enable it
[0:34:28] <+calebstanford9> Yo y'all know about Kamen Rider Fourze? It was written by Kazuki Nakashima of TTGL and Trigger fame @WoolieVersus
[0:34:28] <+badjab326> Apex getting crossplay this fall
[0:34:29] <%Jetzord> you can enable in in lobbies
[0:34:30] <%ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus Sent you one more donation to read before yall start
[0:34:33] <ArtooKilledYou> The ONE console is comin
[0:34:36] <%Irridium> Think Fortnite did the cross-play thing with everything first
[0:34:43] <arurorablade> not full cross play
[0:34:47] <+saltpiggu> test

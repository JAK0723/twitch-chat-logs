[0:13:03] <%ringabal> Feels so long ago, Woolie was just making his way through the WWE.
[0:13:18] <+regis_j_rock> That just speaks how good Mario RPG music is in general. TTYD's soundtrack is stellar, but it's not the best.

[0:38:25] <%Malik1002> Maybe you can blow on them
[0:38:27] <GenericSoda> @indigo_automaton Luigi would beat the shit out of cthulhu
[0:38:28] <%Lazyjoules> that's what I did at least
[0:38:34] <+zooeymainbtw> I believe in wools and reggie
[0:38:39] <+GalacticaPhanto> @indigo_automaton I mean from the stories he tells you in this it's super implied he did
[0:38:53] <+MagiKestral> the collision was for the paper covering the chest... though what THAT is, I couldn't tell you
[0:38:53] <%indigo_automaton> @GalacticaPhanto Sick

[0:39:29] <Papa_Bearman> The worthy, who just so happen to need all the exact powers I got, and no more.
[0:39:32] <+zooeymainbtw> a bottomless curse a bottomless sea
[0:39:32] <%Lazyjoules> indeed Cremated
[0:39:41] <SomersaultJustice> all the dragon balls
[0:39:57] <%RioGascar> I’ll be honest those wall hints make no sense to me
[0:39:58] <scorpionoutcast> Accepting of all that there is, and can be
[0:40:01] <atomicxdj> hint: Pickle stone
[0:40:04] <ScandalousSam262> you gotta go to the boom bassa boom festival to unlock wapeach
[0:40:09] <BlackermanZX> i think i got the hint
[0:40:11] <@akuda_bar> use time stop

[0:40:47] <GenericSoda> did ge whiff with the hammer?
[0:40:48] <+AbnormalVoid> Pickle Block
[0:40:52] <%Solidnick18> use time cop
[0:40:54] <Blunder_Blue> I think the problem with the hint stones is that it has the weird lore in the middle.
[0:40:54] <Potatoidea> BLJ
[0:40:56] <+ConLin_Arts_> Big thunk
[0:40:56] <%RioGascar> However i will chalk it up to me being uneducated in wall hints with vague language
[0:40:56] <+MagiKestral> that's what the Ultra Blocks used to look like in 64, which is cool
[0:40:59] <el_biribon> put your controller in port 2
[0:40:59] <@akuda_bar> use robocop
[0:41:01] <%BisoromiBear> tilt your gamecube 45 degrees
[0:41:01] <%chosenjuan42> Time Pockle
[0:41:07] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> RAIDEN. TURN OFF THE GAME CONSOLE.
[0:41:08] <+brickwall35> @akuda_bar you can't half press a button Kappa
[0:41:09] <%Irridium> drop your shield
[0:41:10] <fault_417> Time stomp
[0:41:10] <%LordSDB> Gotta change it to controller port 2 Kappa
[0:41:15] <scorpionoutcast> You can use Goombella to tattle the blocks
[0:41:17] <atomicxdj> you need to recreat evo moment 37 while changing controller ports woolie
[0:41:19] <@akuda_bar> go into the alternate qpu
[0:41:20] <GenericSoda> the codec frequency is on the back of the box
[0:41:21] <%Lazyjoules> they're color coded, so use the red party member
[0:41:24] <yusefHD> wavedash off screen
[0:41:25] <Blunder_Blue> Unless the purple stuff is actually hints but I think I remember combining the purple lines to make a story.
[0:41:34] <Prevot> you need a Digital Deluxe preorder hammer for that
[0:41:43] <+ConLin_Arts_> sbfpDattebayo

[0:41:53] <%RioGascar> Deactivate the HD “gamecube”
[0:41:55] <ScandalousSam262> you gotta go unlock flavio as a secret last party member at the boom bassa boom festival
[0:42:04] <+VorpalSlash> You need the High-Frequency Hammer
[0:42:05] <fault_417> The purple text is lore meant to read separately from the hints
[0:42:09] <@akuda_bar> you have to plug in a second controller to move goombella separately
[0:42:12] <+brickwall35> need a Pickle Stone 🥒
[0:42:14] <%Lazyjoules> go back and respec all the way into HP, it's the only way
[0:42:15] <el_biribon> goombella actually chat
[0:42:16] <%doomerskeletor13> The Digital Deluxe Yoshi DLC would make this way easier

[1:13:22] <Darren716> Just use jynx
[1:13:28] <gya0s> the trick for striking is more direction than height. You can first strike floaters like that by touching them while moving down
[1:13:29] <CrematedCube> Grodus pulled basically the same trick as Ganondorf in OoT
[1:13:30] <BackwardCap> Grabby hands mogwaiMad

[1:14:40] <yusefHD> Does Ground pound have AOE?
[1:14:41] <gya0s> hit detection is wack. don't try getting above them.

[1:33:59] <+zooeymainbtw> @abelincoln_catpuncher huh neat
[1:34:01] <+masked_hero_lucky> Woolie this is probably a room from earlier, I'm betting you can't get to whatever it is from here
[1:34:01] <%ringabal> It's probably that Repel Flag he didn't take
[1:34:02] <Polarix64> Woolie just keep hitting the boxes
[1:34:07] <Papa_Bearman> @scorpionoutcast The *number* of them.
[1:34:09] <ofodojo> i dont come to this stream often, but when I do its just chat telling woolie all the answers unprovoked
[1:34:17] <+thatguychris93> ^
[1:34:17] <nxflre> @scorpionoutcast yeah appeals and stylish with larger crowd give you more star meter
[1:34:18] <@Menitta> wrong answers only
[1:34:22] <KyaputenFarukon> can't help it
[1:34:22] <ingman112> It’s the item from before woolie, that you dropped

[1:35:07] <morphinomarshal> Nice of them to give a confirmation cut
[1:35:13] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @zooeymainbtw Iirc, the idea is Mario is gaining the power from the audience themselves. hes basically using the power style ala the Sons of Sparda, at least in my head canon
[1:35:13] <scorpionoutcast> @nxflre I’m talking about who is in the crowd. Like, do x-nauts provide less star power?
[1:35:15] <+zooeymainbtw> most people are memeing, not giving real answers, but yeah you do get a OG or two
[1:35:25] <Thunderhog> The answer is always pickle stone

[1:45:27] <+AbnormalVoid> a little sweet, as a treat
[1:45:34] <BrazillianCara> Speaking of controversy, I kind of hope Woolie plays Origami King next, just so he can have a taste of what has become of the franchise/have an unexpectadly good time (and also so he can end on a high note later with 64 or Super).

[1:46:13] <GenericSoda> i just want a Mario Rpg with Origami King's quality of writing
[1:46:14] <Sgww> he's on some naruto shit
[1:46:17] <%TheMyriadGamer> Alright yea he is kinda seen as a hero and hes famous for it, i retract my accusation on Mario/
[1:46:20] <BreakersAweigh> !

[1:46:48] <+zooeymainbtw> hmmmm where to go
[1:46:49] <%TheMyriadGamer> But Luigi though
[1:46:56] <PhantomMaskJr> larxaDETH
[1:46:59] <%Proxzo> Origami King, just for the music, is very much worth a Woolie Play
[1:47:00] <Potatoidea> PogChamp
[1:47:10] <%Superbro64> What's the point of contention here? @themyriadgamer
[1:47:16] <+zooeymainbtw> nah ok is too meh
[1:47:18] <pookam> 999
[1:47:18] <Nomad94> Origami King is so fun
[1:47:20] <+Ancopro> Origami was fun
[1:47:27] <Sgww> ok is ok
[1:47:27] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> I honestly don't see Woolie playing any other paper mario
[1:47:28] <%chosenjuan42> SUPER PAPER MARIO HAS SOME COOL STUFF
[1:47:31] <%TheMyriadGamer> @Superbro64 there isnt one
[1:47:32] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Lie even Super
[1:47:34] <scorpionoutcast> Maxed out coins
[1:47:37] <bone_reaper69> i thought ou put ice badge on last ttme?
[1:47:42] <the_saltiest> Chapter 3 of super paper mario LUL
[1:47:44] <+ConLin_Arts_> Super is my favorite
[1:47:46] <savetitania> Super is a really woolie game though
[1:47:48] <GenericSoda> i love the original one so mucb
[1:47:49] <Potatoidea> @Superbro64 The philosophical question of "Is Mario a simp?"
[1:47:56] <Nomad94> @the_saltiest Did you mean: The Joy of Labor?
[1:48:03] <ofodojo> origami ResidentSleeper king ResidentSleeper
[1:48:11] <+zooeymainbtw> to simp or not to simp, that is the question
[1:48:14] <Nomad94> @ofodojo your opinion is dismissed OpieOP
[1:48:16] <Polarix64> Woolie should go back and play Paper Mario 64, it's combat system is not as good but it's still a very charming game
[1:48:24] <Sgww> simps wouldnt go as far as mario does tbqh
[1:48:26] <BrazillianCara> @Nomad94 No, that's Chapter 2.
[1:48:26] <ofodojo> @Nomad94 lmao
[1:48:27] <GenericSoda> 64 is soooo charming
[1:48:31] <the_saltiest> @Nomad94 That's chapter 2, chapter 3 is the Francis chapter
[1:48:33] <+zooeymainbtw> origami king is not that good lol
[1:48:33] <%Superbro64> Let's say the answer is "yes". Then what? We move on to the next great question of the universe or something?
[1:48:38] <%chosenjuan42> Paper Mario 64 has. Vergil
[1:48:39] <%Proxzo> 64 does have a lot of charm. It's up to Woolie.
[1:48:40] <%Superbro64> sajamSegue3
[1:48:44] <Potatoidea> It's kinda crazy to think Paper Mario 1 and 2 were 3 years apart from each other
[1:48:46] <+zooeymainbtw> it is funny though
[1:48:48] <hassanico2> Anyone seen Paper Mario 64 Master Quest?
[1:48:51] <SixthSun2> He should go to 64 for more RPG goodness, or to Super for more of this good writing.
[1:48:51] <Nomad94> @BrazillianCara Dang, I mixed them up. Digibutter NotLikeThis
[1:48:53] <+Ancopro> 64 also got the koopa bros
[1:48:53] <%Proxzo> I think these games are really long. Might take a Paper Mario break
[1:48:54] <CrematedCube> He should play 64 for the combat and wholesome charm
[1:48:59] <GenericSoda> oh yeah 64 has loser vergil
[1:49:00] <ofodojo> Fight the final boss with no badges you coward
[1:49:00] <CrematedCube> Eventually
[1:49:04] <%TheMyriadGamer> No you debate the question until there is a universal agreement on wether or not he is or is not
[1:49:08] <pookam> where did violence accumulate his gang
[1:49:18] <Potatoidea> The Melee intro
[1:49:19] <GenericSoda> 64 also has the best music, fight me
[1:49:22] <%Proxzo> LIFE SHROOM
[1:49:23] <Nomad94> @pookam groupies

[1:49:35] <%chosenjuan42> stealing
[1:49:36] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Can Wizzerds use life shrooms?
[1:49:41] <+zooeymainbtw> 64 is most definitely worth a play, not sure if worth a stream though
[1:49:41] <%Superbro64> @themyriadgamer I fail to see a reason to argue it at all. Whether he is or isnt has no consequence.
[1:49:43] <%chosenjuan42> yes
[1:49:45] <keithKatze> What did i miss
[1:49:47] <yusefHD> will the shroom get cloned?

[4:20:59] <%SirGO0SE> Woolie knows FeelsBadMan
[4:20:59] <NextTime000> they're trying to work with what they got
[4:21:00] <%heartlesshealer> Super Paper Mario is a good band-aid at least
[4:21:01] <Nomad94> Super Paper Mario has the best Mario story
[4:21:02] <Blunder_Blue> You get one more. You get Super.
[4:21:02] <%NopeBadguy> Why are we still here? Just to suffer?
[4:21:04] <missingangle> Now play Sticker Star and receive whiplash Kappa
[4:21:04] <gya0s> 1 token jabbie
[4:21:04] <Bootkiller6> SPM is weird but also fun
[4:21:05] <+Ancopro> mmmm
[4:21:05] <Kiryurules> One of the best games of this generation, and Nintendo said NAAAAAH
[4:21:05] <%LoVezineTheAir> super paper mario gets weird too
[4:21:05] <+天使42199> Super Paper mario aint bad
[4:21:06] <%DatAsuna> Thanks miyamoto
[4:21:06] <Ookamiden02> yea
[4:21:07] <jettsetter> 64 and super have some cool stuff
[4:21:07] <$BallerSwagBro9k> AGREED
[4:21:07] <+masked_hero_lucky> Super Paper Mario is actually still pretty good
[4:21:07] <+Ryaotz> fair
[4:21:09] <CirclesForever> it was three turns
[4:21:09] <GooseyGanderer> Super has good stuff, but after is tragic.
[4:21:09] <atomicxdj> ye
[4:21:10] <prime_name> Same
[4:21:10] <phatmac16> You’re gonna carry that weight
[4:21:10] <%krispen_wa> Fair
[4:21:11] <Louie_Salmon> You have to hit them
[4:21:11] <$mattynezz> Not fair
[4:21:12] <waltzqueen> fair
[4:21:12] <+zooeymainbtw> fair
[4:21:12] <%ringabal> JUST ATTACK THO
[4:21:12] <+jiggy_snipe> fair
[4:21:12] <missingangle> that's valid
[4:21:13] <%cobalt_phoenix_> YEA
[4:21:14] <%ozmon> Leave it alone now
[4:21:16] <morphinomarshal> It really was a beautiful game. It wasn't a perfect game, it has its flaws and blemishes, but it was a beautiful game.
[4:21:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> The worse tragedy of Paper Mario is that Thousand Year Door was the second game in the series.
[4:21:23] <+xerotwo> R A W K H A W K
[4:21:23] <+i_heart_gaming> charming
[4:21:23] <zeif00> Everybody is fun
[4:21:24] <Kiryurules> FEEL THE RAWK
[4:21:25] <$BallerSwagBro9k> RAW COCK
[4:21:26] <+MagiKestral> if you attacked more, it would have gone faster, but I get it
[4:21:26] <An_Armed_Bear> Should have just been 3 turns, not require 3 attacks
[4:21:28] <%HeroVersusOfficial> RAW KHAWK
[4:21:28] <@akuda_bar> the shaking letters spell taodsnawyaateoeaihzjatomcbomiotycgjresmeoborprwenotwhhrooyakhnoeotnhktiusmcteamtyoebinjjaya
[4:21:28] <dromemer3> break the walls down!!!!
[4:21:31] <+Zenryoku21> big true
[4:21:31] <+i_heart_gaming> CHET RIPPO
[4:21:32] <%doomerskeletor13> They restored all your stuff at least
[4:21:33] <Polarix64> This was a great game
[4:21:33] <RichochetForce> Truth
[4:21:34] <+Ancopro> yup
[4:21:34] <$mattynezz> Yup
[4:21:35] <@Solidus_113> what about the fight against Sam in the beginning of Revengeance?
[4:21:37] <+CptBritches> Though the tree was gorgeous to look at
[4:21:37] <%krispen_wa> DAMN PUNNI'S
[4:21:38] <sunnythedrunk> Yeah
[4:21:38] <BlackermanZX> yuuup
[4:21:39] <Ookamiden02> General White as well
[4:21:39] <munitalprats> tree is weak but if you know what you're doing it doesnt last that long
[4:21:39] <KaitlynnHere> And now super pregnant with Mario’s babies
[4:21:40] <%DatAsuna> We need woolie to play 5 minutes of sticker star just to feel it
[4:21:40] <+jiggy_snipe> chapter 2 sucks
[4:21:40] <gya0s> @morphinomarshal: it's the kind of imperfect that would be AMAZING with a sequel to polish it
[4:21:41] <$mattynezz> Tree just isn't as good
[4:21:41] <bbblaketwitching> it was kinda a proponent for racial cleansing
[4:21:41] <+ConLin_Arts_> Super Paper Mario also have a great cast
[4:21:44] <morphinomarshal> Backtracking for general Whyte was a chore too
[4:21:44] <Nomad94> @akuda_bar are you sure it's not jugenmujugen?
[4:21:45] <+xerotwo> W W E ARC
[4:21:45] <+jiggy_snipe> BUT CHAPTER 3 THO
[4:21:45] <GooseyGanderer> chapter 3 best chapter
[4:21:45] <Snakes_dk> even the wack chapters was good still
[4:21:46] <+i_heart_gaming> WHAT ABOUT BEST BOY CHET RIPPO
[4:21:46] <Nomad94> LUL
[4:21:48] <atomicxdj> the tree is ass and the backtracking quest near the end is also whack
[4:21:49] <%doomerskeletor13> Tree was definitely weakest
[4:21:51] <shiny_prinny> the tree and the General White search are the worst
[4:21:52] <Bootkiller6> Going back and forth in Twilight, and the search for General White were also terrible
[4:21:53] <penitentpentwitch> The lowest low into the highest high
[4:21:55] <dromemer3> best arc!
[4:21:55] <@akuda_bar> i'm not lying to you, that's just what it spells out
[4:21:58] <morphinomarshal> The noose sets the tone
[4:22:02] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> Tree is universally agreed worst part
[4:22:04] <%HeroVersusOfficial> chu~
[4:22:06] <+i_heart_gaming> THE NOOSE
[4:22:07] <Polarix64> Yeah Tree is worst chapter but Glitz Pit makes it up for being the best chapter
[4:22:09] <pookam> :3
[4:22:11] <%chosenjuan42> TOAD TOWN
[4:22:11] <GenericSoda> the crow
[4:22:18] <Papa_Bearman> Second worst is General White.
[4:22:19] <+zooeymainbtw> super paper mario is pretty lit, not sure if good for stream though
[4:22:19] <%chosenjuan42> ONLY TOAD TOWN
[4:22:20] <+xerotwo> doodLUL
[4:22:30] <@akuda_bar> the noose represents nooses
[4:22:30] <Potatoidea> "We execute people here"
[4:22:30] <%ringabal> BILL
[4:22:31] <KaitlynnHere> Yeah, a noose
[4:22:31] <Papa_Bearman> You were lied to.
[4:22:31] <xu_kitty> Noose Town, YEYE
[4:22:31] <GenericSoda> it's just there to be creepy
[4:22:32] <+天使42199> atpBigot you know
[4:22:33] <%Irridium> Episode 1: Is that a noose?!
[4:22:33] <atomicxdj> First part + Glitz ville best part hands down
[4:22:34] <munitalprats> deter scum
[4:22:34] <+jiggy_snipe> it's a pirate town LUL
[4:22:35] <Bootkiller6> Noose is used in port towns to spook pirates
[4:22:36] <%DatAsuna> how many meadows
[4:22:37] <Prevot> what do you think a noose is used for?
[4:22:37] <+zooeymainbtw> just a noose bro
[4:22:38] <+xerotwo> NO PIRATES
[4:22:39] <+Ancopro> I assumed shadow queen
[4:22:40] <%kinetikpaws> kinetikpaws subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Glad you can know and share our pain of one my top games ever. Here's to a possible Super Paper Mario in the near future. Cheers
[4:22:41] <KaitlynnHere> They never even talked about it
[4:22:42] <Nomad94> it's a noose, it does noose things
[4:22:42] <bbblaketwitching> Shadow Queen execution?
[4:22:43] <%ozmon> It was the centerpiece for the whole final battle lol
[4:22:45] <%Jp3g95> GALLOWS
[4:22:45] <morphinomarshal> The noose is an unspoken reminder
[4:22:47] <+Shotgundam009> Peach be executing people
[4:22:47] <masterfire23> bug fables next?
[4:22:48] <missingangle> I always thought it was where the shadow queen was hung
[4:22:51] <Taclism> Can't use the noose on grotus head :(
[4:22:53] <%RioGascar> its the same as pirates of carrabean intro with jack sparrow
[4:22:55] <Polarix64> Noose was the centerpiece for final battle
[4:22:55] <glass_marcus> I symbolizes the death of creative freedom
[4:22:57] <%PKSomething> Bug Fables would be hype
[4:22:57] <+xerotwo> THEM GALLOWS
[4:22:58] <anarchistPastry> the noose is probably where Shadow Queen was hung or something
[4:23:03] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Ookamiden02
[4:23:05] <BlackermanZX> thr grim reminder that the gallows awaits you
[4:23:10] <bbblaketwitching> JABBIES CORTEZ DRAGON
[4:23:10] <+Ancopro> shower
[4:23:10] <Potatoidea> SHOWER
[4:23:10] <%HeroVersusOfficial> Shower flashback
[4:23:10] <BrazillianCara> I still he should play Origami KIng next, even as a one-off.
[4:23:10] <GenericSoda> I'm down with whatever Woolie wants to do next
[4:23:12] <%chosenjuan42> SUPER PAPER MARIO has an incredible story
[4:23:13] <KaitlynnHere> But I thought they usually keep pirate bodies inside the noose
[4:23:14] <DerpioParty> SHOWER
[4:23:14] <xu_kitty> Showe Scene, let's gooooo
[4:23:15] <%DukeBlack_> shadow queen wasnt hung
[4:23:15] <CirclesForever> lore rat
[4:23:16] <Bootkiller6> The bard
[4:23:17] <NextTime000> the real deaths were the characters we forgot along the way
[4:23:17] <CrematedCube> It tells you "This town don't fuck around"
[4:23:18] <Papa_Bearman> Lorat?
[4:23:19] <%BisoromiBear> Carl the rat
[4:23:20] <gya0s> Grifty
[4:23:23] <heartlesshealer> roof lore

[4:23:25] <penitentpentwitch> Buyable Lore
[4:23:28] <morphinomarshal> Everyone has something going on
[4:23:29] <xu_kitty> Mario's hung, for sure. Maybe even more than Pat.
[4:23:31] <An_Armed_Bear> If we wants more of this gameplay Bug Fables is good, but I feel he'll want to try other stuff
[4:23:32] <Ookamiden02> The real noose were the friends we made along the way
[4:23:36] <%ozmon> Yeah, man, even if nobody was truly on-screened, we've got Scarlette, a Toad Ghost...
[4:23:37] <+AbnormalVoid> Check for more lore and Luigi Books
[4:23:40] <%heartlesshealer> even a story behind your powerups
[4:23:45] <morphinomarshal> Remember that dysfunctional family with the writer dad with writer's block, the gambler mom and the neglected son?
[4:23:47] <xu_kitty> Vivian is, too, depending which version you're playing.
[4:23:51] <+heyitsbrian> @anarchistPastry That was my thought too, that it was where the Shadow Queen was hung 1000 years ago
[4:23:57] <bbblaketwitching> @dukeblack_ I get the impression she mighta been well hung considering the Vivian situation...
[4:23:57] <sunnythedrunk> Ancient heroes is basically a Fire Emblem trope
[4:23:59] <%chosenjuan42> FAN ART
[4:24:02] <%crimsonphoenix69> Dude Woolie

[4:24:14] <atomicxdj> yeah that is hype as hell

[4:24:15] <bone_reaper69> You should "say hi" to Goombella real quick in post-game. Worth it.
[4:24:15] <sunnythedrunk> RIP Iwata

[4:24:25] <atomicxdj> F Iwata
[4:24:25] <CrematedCube> If you love the gameplay, 64 is more of that and totally worth checking out
[4:24:28] <+zooeymainbtw> BibleThump
[4:24:29] <%YakumoYomi> Iwata
[4:24:29] <$NoWayRyanTatum> Iwata would've let us have TTYD2

[4:24:43] <dromemer3> im so glad you loved it wools!!!!
[4:24:44] <%DatAsuna> Chatter stop bringing it up
[4:24:44] <Laironx3> BibleThump
[4:24:45] <%chosenjuan42> Is Luigi's final book in the shop?
[4:24:46] <+xerotwo> POST END GAME STUFF THO
[4:24:47] <Bootkiller6> oh no it's all turned to piss again
[4:24:47] <NextTime000> That's the real deaths
[4:24:50] <%NopeBadguy> @WoolieVersus There is some post game stuff. You can reclimb the Glitz Pit, I think there's a new Luigi book and some new Troubles.
[4:24:50] <%heartlesshealer> Epilogue episode please
[4:24:51] <%kinetikpaws> thank you mods
[4:24:52] <%RioGascar> last look at scum town
[4:24:54] <+Ancopro> they fuckin killed off toadsworth
[4:24:55] <An_Armed_Bear> Gotta make room for Dr. Baby Rosalina
[4:24:55] <+MagiKestral> there is a Trouble y'all should do, round out the show and dunk on luigi a bit
[4:24:55] <CirclesForever> post game aint all that tbh
[4:24:56] <Mr_Strut> Nintendo says no
[4:24:57] <%notgarza> F
[4:24:57] <morphinomarshal> They could easily bring back Goombella
[4:24:58] <%krispen_wa> chatterbox DEFEATED
[4:25:00] <munitalprats> postgame has luigi's conclusion and talking to goombella is worth
[4:25:04] <$mattynezz> Post game is VERY limited
[4:25:07] <GenericSoda> there's a cameo from a character from the original Paper Mario as well
[4:25:14] <%chosenjuan42> IS LUIGIS LAST BOOK IN THE SHOP?
[4:25:14] <Polarix64> Do check out 64 when you have the chance, it's not as crazy as this game but it's still super charming
[4:25:14] <+xerotwo> Yes, VERY limited
[4:25:15] <%PKSomething> @WoolieVersus There's a cameo from Paper Mario 1 in Poshley Heights
[4:25:16] <gya0s> It'ss a petty as shit hill, but I HATE that Doogans never made it out
[4:25:26] <morphinomarshal> We need to find out what the treasure of TTYD was!
[4:25:28] <Potatoidea> They're saving everyone for the Mario Heroes gacha game
[4:25:29] <%RioGascar> they can bring back some characters
[4:25:33] <gya0s> @chosenjuan42: yes
[4:25:34] <+skyheys> no, we NEED Rose Metal Baby Peach in Mario Kart
[4:25:36] <+天使42199> atpBigot ???
[4:25:38] <RunoEddie> the cameo of Lady Bow will mean nothing for Woolie, he didn't play PM1
[4:25:38] <%RioGascar> goombella and koops can come back
[4:25:39] <+zooeymainbtw> oh yeah go to poshly heights and talk to goombella
[4:25:47] <%chosenjuan42> Would love to play as an X NAUT in Mario Kart
[4:25:47] <RaidenRising> MIYAMOTO SAYS NO WOOLIE
[4:25:50] <dromemer3> vivian os OC!
[4:25:54] <prime_name> @Potatoidea I'd simp for Summer Goombella
[4:25:57] <@akuda_bar> miyamoto HATES violence
[4:26:01] <+jiggy_snipe> Violence can be any color so its fine
[4:26:01] <xu_kitty> One more time: I feel that Vivian is the same species as the Queen. Anyone else feel it, too?
[4:26:02] <GooseyGanderer> I still don't get that dumb character rule they have enforced.
[4:26:02] <+zooeymainbtw> for later if he goes back tho
[4:26:10] <atomicxdj> More vanilla
[4:26:11] <%DatAsuna> Nor does Toadette
[4:26:12] <SixthSun2> 64 is also still good, despite being not as fleshed out as TTYD
[4:26:13] <CirclesForever> super paper has some characters in it
[4:26:14] <%DatAsuna> Or wluigi
[4:26:15] <dromemer3> R.I.P Toddete
[4:26:16] <+zooeymainbtw> ye
[4:26:16] <$BallerSwagBro9k> MIYAMOTO NEEDS TO GO
[4:26:18] <@akuda_bar> @xu_kitty i'm pretty sure that's confirmed to be true
[4:26:19] <+jiggy_snipe> @xu_kitty Woolie noticed that
[4:26:20] <%DatAsuna> but they sit in the sports game ghetto too
[4:26:20] <Prevot> reminder that Miyamoto has nothing to do with it and it's all Kensuke Tanabe's fault
[4:26:20] <+skyheys> it's not Miyamoto tho :U its Nintendo as a whole
[4:26:21] <gya0s> That's pretty explicit, isn't it? They're all shadow folks
[4:26:23] <+Ancopro> well apparently it's not miyamoto buuut pretty sure...
[4:26:25] <nxflre> BUT NOW PLAY THE FIRST ONE
[4:26:26] <+bimblehim> too many ghosts and demons for miyamoto
[4:26:26] <@Menitta> Having the unique characters in this kind of spin off does wonders to make the game feel much more substantial and stand out
[4:26:26] <bone_reaper69> @WoolieVersus quick postgame stuff!
[4:26:27] <Polarix64> @RunoEddie True but it would give him a taste in how he should check out 64 since Bow is a great character
[4:26:29] <%heartlesshealer> Get that final goodbye in post-game
[4:26:32] <+i_heart_gaming> does Luigi have 1 more book or no?
[4:26:34] <%DukeBlack_> @xu_kitty they literally tell you in game they are
[4:26:35] <Louie_Salmon> I can't believe there's a generic bob-omb in the new game that I'm supposed to treat as a character
[4:26:37] <%gatorafan> Now delete the save data Kappa
[4:26:39] <%ozmon> I can't believe how much great stuff is here
[4:26:42] <%DatAsuna> Luigi time
[4:26:44] <+vaderxyz1970> @CirclesForever Super paper mario has some Geometrical shapes in it...
[4:26:47] <Drusain> Frankly will tell you what the treasure was if you visit him
[4:26:47] <$BallerSwagBro9k> It does not
[4:26:48] <%fly2555_of_the_rebellion> ye
[4:26:49] <%RioGascar> this magic will never be brought back : l
[4:26:49] <munitalprats> Super Paper mario is the end
[4:26:49] <xu_kitty> Oh, there was that interview for Origami King that specified that yeah: they specifically don't want any existing species to be the new villain, so they can kill it off and never use it again.
[4:26:49] <+zooeymainbtw> yeah all the siren sisters are the same race as the shadow queen
[4:26:53] <@Menitta> Mario and Luigi the first 3 are really good
[4:26:54] <dromemer3> 64!!!!!
[4:26:54] <GooseyGanderer> Super has good story.
[4:26:54] <%nmaten> TTYD is definitely the best one imo
[4:26:55] <sunnythedrunk> Paper Mario 64 is very good too
[4:26:55] <morphinomarshal> Super Paper Mario is good
[4:26:56] <%PKSomething> Super and Origami
[4:26:56] <Ashenik1> It does in the witcher 3 Kappa
[4:26:57] <ofodojo> play super star saga
[4:26:57] <Mr_Strut> 64 is good, Super is alright
[4:26:58] <Kiryurules> 64 is good!
[4:26:59] <+Aeoneth> Super Paper Mario is legit
[4:26:59] <$mattynezz> Close, but TTYD is the best
[4:26:59] <SomersaultJustice> SPM sucks
[4:26:59] <%RadicalWeegee> 2 great ones
[4:26:59] <@Menitta> Super Paper Mario is great
[4:26:59] <@akuda_bar> superstar saga is good
[4:27:00] <SixthSun2> 64 is more RPG goodness, Super is more writing goodness, but not both
[4:27:00] <GenericSoda> @Louie_Salmon it actually works, which is surprising. It would be more nice if he was unique though
[4:27:00] <Snakes_dk> Super parer mario has good story stuff
[4:27:01] <Polarix64> 64 is still really good and Super is unique at least
[4:27:01] <atomicxdj> Super is the last good one sadly
[4:27:02] <+marumariball> 64 for usre
[4:27:02] <%doomerskeletor13> Super is good
[4:27:02] <Louie_Salmon> Super was neat, flawed
[4:27:03] <Darthkitten_Prime> Super Paper Mario has a good story, but not nearly the same level of gameplay
[4:27:04] <Bootkiller6> Paper Mario 64 is great, and Super Paper Mario is good but weird
[4:27:05] <Blank9> origami and 64 are good
[4:27:06] <ofodojo> and Partners in Time
[4:27:07] <savetitania> @WoolieVersus Super goes weird, not as cool, but *really out there*
[4:27:09] <RichochetForce> Legendary Game
[4:27:11] <NextTime000> the writing is still there, IS is just forced to work with what they're confined to
[4:27:12] <RaidenRising> super was flawed , but great
[4:27:12] <+Zenryoku21> super is bueno
[4:27:13] <%doomerskeletor13> Origami is great it’s just different from this
[4:27:14] <Zap_Rowsdower32> The new Paper Marios are such a waste too because they have a bunch of the old Love-De-Lics working on them
[4:27:16] <+TheNotoriousJTS> BIG SALES
[4:27:17] <Prevot> probably the same
[4:27:18] <prime_name> Gangbusters
[4:27:18] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> That'll be $69.99
[4:27:18] <+xerotwo> THIS WOULD SELL WELL
[4:27:18] <jfp4life> Poshley hights has a Cameo from PM 64, don't know if you guys saw it
[4:27:18] <%DatAsuna> Those two are the first one and the wii one

[4:39:38] <%LuckyLagomorph> Guys Woolie hasn't played 64 the Poshley Heights thing wouldn't hit
[4:39:38] <+Ancopro> camoe from 64
[4:39:38] <%krispen_wa> Is the Poshley Heights thing even worth it if he hasn't played PM64?
[4:39:39] <%kinetikpaws> I would like him to see who's in the Troblecenter
[4:39:39] <Bootkiller6> Paper Mario 64 reference

[4:39:41] <RunoEddie> don''t bother with Poshley Heights
[4:39:41] <shiny_prinny> not worth
[4:39:42] <+VorpalSlash> 64 reference
[4:39:42] <Papa_Bearman> It's a cameo from a Paper Mario partner.
[4:39:42] <@akuda_bar> you wouldn't get it
[4:39:43] <Polarix64> Just that
[4:39:43] <$phd_in_thuggery> Poshley has an easter egg but you could skip it
[4:39:43] <%DatAsuna> poshley is far, yeah
[4:39:43] <atomicxdj> no its a retuning character
[4:39:44] <+tigerfang86> not worth it
[4:39:44] <Drusain> guys he has no frame of reference
[4:39:45] <gya0s> a reference to a game you haven't played
[4:39:45] <HeckDarnit> nothing important
[4:39:46] <+SwerveBootyHammer> it's not worth it
[4:39:47] <%doomerskeletor13> It’s a reference you won’t understand
[4:39:47] <%chosenjuan42> not a frouble6
[4:39:47] <%PKSomething> It's a character from Paper Mario 64
[4:39:47] <CrematedCube> New character
[4:39:47] <morphinomarshal> Don't you want to see what happened to Jermaine?
[4:39:49] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> just go to every area to be sure

[4:39:49] <Thunderhog> We're good woolz if anything

[4:39:50] <savetitania> A 64 cameo
[4:39:51] <+regis_j_rock> It's an npc came
[4:39:52] <GenericSoda> its a cameo from the previous game

[4:39:54] <SomersaultJustice> there's a cameo from paper mario1
[4:39:55] <%heartlesshealer> Glitz Pit is the only other one kinda worth it, but it's fine
[4:39:56] <+jiggy_snipe> if he's never played the game, then the cameo would mean nothing chat
[4:39:56] <+ChaosEmralds> its related to 64
[4:39:58] <%HeroVersusOfficial> Poshley doesnt make sense until he plays 64
[4:39:58] <yusefHD> Can you hit the Whackabump 'cause jesus christ
[4:40:00] <RaidenRising> go for the 64 cast cameo
[4:40:00] <missingangle> It's a PM 64 reference
[4:40:01] <%Chatterbox1991> you can do a rap up later
[4:40:02] <savetitania> Paper Mario 64
[4:40:02] <Polarix64> Please do it though

[4:43:49] <An_Armed_Bear> I feel like Cyberseluth is bad for LPing
[4:43:50] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Even longer than Paper Mario
[4:43:52] <%Chatterbox1991> I'm really sorry for being a sore loser these last couple of stream, this was a fantastic ending to an otherwise fantastic lp, I LOVE YOU ALL
[4:43:52] <%Davybot> “Finale of the timeline” but it’s not
[4:43:55] <GamerWorlock> Cyber is good but also long
[4:43:55] <Manmush> very very slow
[4:43:55] <+leondatwani> I would love a Cybersleuth playthrough

[4:44:06] <An_Armed_Bear> Yeah
[4:44:09] <@akuda_bar> yeah cybersleuth is LP Poison

[4:44:24] <+regis_j_rock> Yo, when you get the chance look at the Peach costumes from Project M, you might find something cool in there.
[4:44:24] <Manmush> and the second/expansion is a bit better written
[4:44:25] <%heartlesshealer> could host a different LP during the grind
[4:44:32] <derap41> As if they liked FF14
[4:44:33] <+天使42199> #13000 again PogChamp
[4:44:33] <%DatAsuna> I can attest to this
[4:44:34] <JeoDood> Cyberseluth is not lping grind fest but i like digimon
[4:44:34] <+jiggy_snipe> here comes the #Sleuth13000
[4:44:38] <@akuda_bar> I LIKED cyberslueth but also. It's definitely LP poison.
[4:44:41] <prime_name> Next Order is the LP poison
[4:44:42] <CrematedCube> It won't win additional fans
[4:44:42] <%Chatterbox1991> LOVE YOU ALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
[4:44:42] <%heartlesshealer> Have Reggie do something with his new video card
[4:44:43] <%DatAsuna> I like cybersleuth but it's a bad LP game
[4:44:44] <+leondatwani> It can be a bit of a visual novel at times
[4:44:45] <glass_marcus> it's poison
[4:44:47] <GamerWorlock> Just try the new digimon rpg when it comes out
[4:44:49] <%doomerskeletor13> Sounds like a bad LP game
[4:44:50] <An_Armed_Bear> Oh god Next ORder
[4:44:51] <+skyheys> I like Digimon. Dont do it
[4:44:52] <MrGameNJosh> Too bad, if you ever play 64, itll seem like a downgrade.
[4:44:52] <glass_marcus> play it on your own time
[4:44:56] <An_Armed_Bear> That is Un-LPable
[4:44:57] <dromemer3> paper mario 64!!!
[4:44:58] <sunnythedrunk> Sounds more like a podcast topic
[4:45:01] <RichochetForce> Yes
[4:45:02] <%DatAsuna> +1 on the LP poison train
[4:45:03] <prime_name> Cyber Sleuth is not poison
[4:45:04] <+jiggy_snipe> and good voice over work also
[4:45:05] <munitalprats> Its not worth playing for an LP but its amazing so you should play it on your own
[4:45:11] <yusefHD> Would you ever do a "Bring your own mugen character" For Fun?
[4:45:12] <%Chatterbox1991> you are describing Dragon Age in a nutshell
[4:45:15] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Cyber Sleuth is very much TMS
[4:45:17] <SomersaultJustice> #13000FE
[4:45:18] <+skyheys> Cyber Sleuth is all grinding, no character
[4:45:21] <Prevot> and that wasn't even a good game
[4:45:21] <@akuda_bar> superstar saga next tho
[4:45:22] <%kewlmyc> 100% LP poison. Story/characters aren't interesting enough and a shit ton of grinding
[4:45:24] <%DatAsuna> Nah TMS is actually funny
[4:45:27] <Blank9> YEAH TMS
[4:45:27] <penitentpentwitch> RPGs and enforced grind
[4:45:28] <sunnythedrunk> #13000FE
[4:45:29] <prime_name> Cyber Sleuth is nowhere near TMS level

[4:45:43] <%DatAsuna> Cyber Sleuth is way less entertaining
[4:45:44] <%doomerskeletor13> Never forget TMS
[4:45:49] <%DatAsuna> The cast is very dry
[4:45:49] <@Menitta> There's that one persona game....trauma team
[4:45:50] <+ladomania> P2 tho
[4:45:54] <%Irridium> never forget Barry Forever
[4:45:54] <redrins> so we're going back to fire emblem right Kappa
[4:45:55] <Prevot> TMS is pure trash
[4:45:56] <+heyitsbrian> Cyber Sleuth has a way to easy grind that makes the story the focus over the battles IMO... but it's pretty much TMS beyond that
[4:45:58] <%ringabal> @Menitta MY MAN
[4:45:59] <%SirGO0SE> #13000FE was the fucking best
[4:45:59] <lambishly> Need a good RPG with low grind value
[4:46:00] <+jiggy_snipe> play Persona 1 Kappa
[4:46:10] <Blank9> Raidou would be a decent one just because action and concept
[4:46:12] <%ringabal> WE PUSHIN FOR TRAUMA TEAM NOW
[4:46:13] <%JD_Lars> Chrono Trigger takes a good pace
[4:46:14] <munitalprats> play three houses LUL
[4:46:17] <@Solidus_113> Week of one-offs starts now
[4:46:22] <%kewlmyc> Lol play a Tales game. It can be co-op too.
[4:46:24] <Ashenik1> SEKIRO EKHMEM
[4:46:25] <%heartlesshealer> Maybe try for future next year or something
[4:46:25] <+天使42199> Three Houses atpGasm
[4:46:25] <An_Armed_Bear> RIP Sekiro
[4:46:25] <%Proxzo> Is Origami King stream friendly?
[4:46:29] <%heartlesshealer> always a reason
[4:46:30] <+jiggy_snipe> SEKIRO HMMMM
[4:46:31] <MrGameNJosh> do windwaker
[4:46:32] <yusefHD> GHOST OF TSUSHIMA (Finale)
[4:46:33] <morphinomarshal> What was the reason for Sekiro?
[4:46:33] <%Lion_kun> RIP jojo
[4:46:33] <dromemer3> nope
[4:46:34] <+skyheys> Every Digimon game is a dumb time investment unfortunately
[4:46:35] <SomersaultJustice> RIP 7th Stand User
[4:46:36] <%bread_assassin> Did Woolie ever beat Sekiro?
[4:46:37] <lambishly> Origami King is pretty boring
[4:46:37] <%kewlmyc> S E K I R O
[4:46:39] <penitentpentwitch> Disco Elysium, good game. The deepest of LP poison.
[4:46:42] <xu_kitty> Look, I'll just say one thing about Digimon: if you wanna talk about THEE 'Gatomon' from the anime, call her "Tailmon": "Gato" refers to a *male* cat.
[4:46:43] <%chosenjuan42> Super Paper Mario is good for LP
[4:46:43] <RichochetForce> RIP Dio
[4:46:44] <Manmush> its really not that bad
[4:46:46] <morphinomarshal> Always an exception eh?
[4:46:49] <+Jaysky> Which Jojo?
[4:46:50] <%doomerskeletor13> Sekiro will be the exception
[4:46:56] <+Jaysky> The 3D fighter?
[4:46:58] <+jiggy_snipe> KH FeelsBadMan
[4:46:59] <%heartlesshealer> Kingdom Hearts died because channel died, so that was fair
[4:47:00] <Drusain> nuzlocke
[4:47:01] <%DatAsuna> Sekiro and Jojo are it iirc
[4:47:02] <munitalprats> its LP poison.
[4:47:02] <%heartlesshealer> NO
[4:47:03] <+skyheys> I was thinking of Sekiro Kappa
[4:47:03] <misterurbanthelegend> Minecraft
[4:47:03] <Manmush> varity is nice
[4:47:04] <falyden> what was dropped?
[4:47:05] <+jiggy_snipe> YES
[4:47:05] <@akuda_bar> Oh yeah ti is
[4:47:05] <munitalprats> its SUPER POISON
[4:47:08] <@Solidus_113> Nier was basically dropped
[4:47:08] <%SirGO0SE> read forever
[4:47:08] <morphinomarshal> Pat ate that bullet
[4:47:09] <%krispen_wa> IT IS MEGA POISON
[4:47:10] <%heartlesshealer> Too much dialogue
[4:47:10] <derap41> Its a novel
[4:47:11] <Bootkiller6> It has a shitload of reading
[4:47:11] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> It would probably happen with Digimon tbf
[4:47:11] <%Lion_kun> do a one off
[4:47:12] <%chosenjuan42> ded
[4:47:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait why
[4:47:13] <RichochetForce> Disco Elysium VA is DEATH
[4:47:13] <%ringabal> EXPOSITION BUILD RUN
[4:47:14] <prime_name> BIG POISON
[4:47:14] <%DatAsuna> KH is cursed yeah
[4:47:15] <redrins> rip throats from all the text
[4:47:15] <dromemer3> God hand!
[4:47:15] <lambishly> Reggie play Disco Elysium on your own time it's good
[4:47:18] <Robot_Nixon_> its basically a book
[4:47:20] <%Irridium> It's literally all text
[4:47:22] <%Tearonex> It's LP VENOM on steroids
[4:47:22] <%doomerskeletor13> Well KH has a pretty good reason
[4:47:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ohhhh
[4:47:23] <huskarl_zap> crusader kings 3
[4:47:23] <%Chatterbox1991> @woolieversus is Max Payne lp poison?
[4:47:24] <%chosenjuan42> BOOK
[4:47:25] <@akuda_bar> 1) You have to read all the dialog out loud and 2) some of the scenes are super awkward to pay attention to and pay attention to your chat in
[4:47:26] <derap41> Its good but its not LP good
[4:47:26] <%Irridium> It's fucking AMAZING but yeah LP poison
[4:47:27] <BlackermanZX> damn
[4:47:27] <%krispen_wa> AMAZING
[4:47:32] <RichochetForce> It's north of a 5 billion words
[4:47:32] <%SirGO0SE> i mean, AI Dungeon 2 *is* a fun stream tho
[4:47:33] <%Javaa01> One million words
[4:47:33] <%heartlesshealer> Good experience, but throat death
[4:47:34] <%bread_assassin> Disco Elysium is LP poison, but for them not us.
[4:47:38] <Ashenik1> Woolie what about witcher ? Thronebreaker has 30 hrs. Do you think wither could be lp ed?
[4:47:41] <%chosenjuan42> Super Paper Mario would be great on the future
[4:47:41] <%krispen_wa> TOP 5 CRPG
[4:47:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> It's not just a book, it's a MEATY BOOK.
[4:47:45] <munitalprats> Witcher series!
[4:47:45] <+masked_hero_lucky> Digimon has a long stretch of small arcs, with bits of way less interesting side quests, and then eventually a big series of plot pop-offs
[4:47:47] <%doomerskeletor13> Disco Elysian would be a bad LP yeah
[4:47:53] <+Jaysky> Super Pap Ma Woolie would enjoy
[4:47:53] <yusefHD> Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg LUL
[4:47:56] <Laironx3> it would be a throat bomb
[4:47:59] <uberdude47> what abouut Pokemon Coloseum
[4:48:01] <+JustToWatch> @WoolieVersus Would you do an outer wilds lp
[4:48:02] <%RioGascar> Disco has some voiced lines
[4:48:02] <%cobalt_phoenix_> what about a game with a ton of codex entries that are kinda optional like mass effect
[4:48:03] <atomicxdj> @WoolieVersus would you be willing to tackle MGSV as a future LP?
[4:48:04] <%RioGascar> but not a ton
[4:48:07] <Bootkiller6> There's a lot of voice work, but yeah there's still a lot of unvoiced lines too
[4:48:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> There's more writing that a Game of Thrones book, Reggie. It's beefy.
[4:48:19] <An_Armed_Bear> Colosseum would actually be neat.
[4:48:20] <+skyheys> all these "please do this" comments LUL
[4:48:23] <morphinomarshal> Angewoman and Deviwoman?
[4:48:23] <xu_kitty> Yo! Woolie! I just posted on the Reddit, but I recommended to you "Megaman.EXE: Network Transmission" -it's OST is in the same vein as the X-Naut base's music.
[4:48:24] <munitalprats> what, beelzemon and deviwomon?
[4:48:25] <prime_name> Sistermon Noir
[4:48:29] <Manmush> sistermon?

[4:48:39] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> I DONATED PLZ PLAY MY GAME
[4:48:40] <@Menitta> If you're gonna do a big text game, I feel like Ace Attorney would be more ideal
[4:48:41] <Ashenik1> @WoolieVersus Could you ever tackle the wtiche series?
[4:48:41] <Mr_Strut> Tittymon are grea
[4:48:45] <lambishly> Grandia and Grandia II are pretty good and don't really have any grind, you get where you need to walking forwards
[4:48:48] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> The only place I have seen Disco Elysium LP'd is on LRR's "Talking Simulator" block
[4:48:48] <+skyheys> that's like half of all digimon
[4:48:48] <CrematedCube> I'm like "Do what you want"

[4:52:54] <dromemer3> hypno space outlaw!!!!
[4:52:54] <%RioGascar> really you dont need watercooling unless you plan to overclock
[4:52:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> ULTRAKILL IS HYPE
[4:52:57] <derap41> @RichochetForce Compared to custom loops
[4:53:00] <%Javaa01> Ultrakill is fantastic, and it would murder you if you tried to do it live on stream
[4:53:06] <@Solidus_113> Gloomwood
[4:53:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> Also ULTRAKILL legit has one of the best OSTs I've heard all year.
[4:53:13] <misterurbanthelegend> Would you play Gungrave and or Gungrave Overdose?
[4:53:14] <Robot_Nixon_> whens HL2 distCut

[0:29:40] <+dukenux> sbfpWelcome sbfpKoopy
[0:29:40] <marvel877> Did Woolie play catch up to remember what was going on in the game?
[0:29:41] <Sphincter_Spelunker> cool. I'm 40 mins late and still on time. sweet
[0:29:41] <$SidBoyTM> Yo
[0:29:42] <happyface699> The story is a incoherent mess
[0:29:44] <socratetris> TY! Will do!
[0:29:44] <+Th3SmartAlec> I hope the modders get on it
[0:29:46] <%wumpa45> wumpa45 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[0:29:54] <happyface699> but the gameplay is a plus
[0:29:56] <+kiiiirsten> @Sphincter_Spelunker LUL Go ahead and pee, grab a snack, no rush
[0:29:56] <%TeraMercier> I was so fake hyped for Lady that I'm pretty bummed about DMC now
[0:29:57] <thepiefoot> I believe them if they say that there is no dlc coming, REmake didn't even got that much dlc
[0:30:02] <hassanico> "Randomizer mode though"
[0:30:07] <Dragon_Batman> That makes sense
[0:30:09] <+thesw1tch> @sidboytm you fool. run!
[0:30:10] <%QueequegTheater> Poor Lucia
[0:30:10] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Dragon's Dogma 2, baby!
[0:30:11] <gustavozxd> yeah capcom said the first row of re2 dlc and nothing yet
[0:30:14] <+bread_assassin> Give me Dragon's Dogma 2.
[0:30:17] <+nharliecash> hopefully the RE2 team has moved onto RE3 make
[0:30:19] <Radregice_> i prefer new (good) content
[0:30:19] <+ThatGuyfromMars> golly the one time I want Capcom to milk the fuck out REmake 2 and they deny me
[0:30:19] <zecht89> yea that's preferable too
[0:30:21] <insaneintentionsyo> yo
[0:30:21] <bigbradish> Thats so odd to me considering all the money those games made
[0:30:24] <PoisonKnuckle> It was canceled because they‚Äôre making DmC 2 instead.
[0:30:25] <jorgeniev> DRAGONS DOG MA IS COMIN
[0:30:28] <thetruenicster> didnt okabe say in an interview in February that there would be more dlc?
[0:30:29] <+raiden_fall> compared to re7 they didn't do much but it was great that it was free
[0:30:29] <$SidBoyTM> @thesw1tch WHERE TO?!
[0:30:33] <rytisone> RE2 dlc is RE3. DMC 5 will have SE in a couple of years
[0:30:33] <Joestar1890> DMC Revengance!
[0:30:35] <%TheNewJapanGuy> DMCV Special Edition is "probably happen" eventually anyway, maybe
[0:30:35] <+ThatGuyfromMars> that isn't my fetish capcom
[0:30:40] <gustavozxd> @Valentinius_Anodyne that MIGHT be announced next year maybe, but it's not coming in a while for sure
[0:30:41] <%TeraMercier> @WoolieVersus You think that news means anything about a Special edition coming out much later?
[0:30:41] <@Menitta> The Ladies Night of Devil May Cry
[0:30:41] <Dragon_Batman> Yea would be dope
[0:30:43] <%TheNewJapanGuy> will*
[0:30:43] <happyface699> Remake code Veronica so we get campy wesker again
[0:30:45] <Dragon_Batman> either way
[0:30:47] <gustavozxd> GOOD FIGHTING GAME!?
[0:30:48] <alcors_wisdom> i mean lady vergil and trish all have move sets already in the game so modders just need to assign buttons to them and youre pretty much set
[0:30:49] <42nfl19> Would you rather it be a DLC, Expansion, or own thing?
[0:30:51] <@Menitta> Vergil NEEDS to be in 5
[0:30:58] <+Th3SmartAlec> @rytisone Yeah that's probably right
[0:30:59] <%QueequegTheater> DMC6 is a Lady/Lucia/Trish buddy cop adventure
[0:31:03] <gustavozxd> I need a capcom vs capcom like come on
[0:31:04] <+thesw1tch> @sidboytm it's too late! the bus is getting fucked by a dinosaur now... you missed some dumb shit lol
[0:31:05] <%TeraMercier> I think I can respect a special edition
[0:31:05] <thepiefoot> @nharliecash I've read that it's not going to be the same team
[0:31:10] <Archmortal> I would hope capcom has learned how to expand games instead of constant rereleases by now
[0:31:11] <jorgeniev> I BELIVE IN THEM
[0:31:14] <%salty_syd913> @QueequegTheater god i want that so bad

[0:34:21] <$SidBoyTM> What was the official name again?
[0:34:21] <thepiefoot> Calling him "the tyrant" would make confusion, i beleive

[0:34:34] <Brother_Coduss> @nharliecash that's literally all of the 103 series of tyrants though

[0:35:11] <$SidBoyTM> I'm about to get big stoned and watch woolie bumble through this game
[0:35:15] <thepiefoot> @SidBoyTM The 100 series is the ones that were succesful, thus were mass produced
[0:35:15] <rytisone> Ada wait
[0:35:16] <crazy_laughter> It's even more terrifying that MR X is juat a jobber with a serial number.
[0:35:21] <b1gboss007> MADE IN HEAVEN -Woolie probably
[0:35:21] <%TeraMercier> I think I missed it, woolie "replayed it up to here" What does that mean?
[0:35:23] <marvel877> 9 and a half hours, we only half way in the sewers.
[0:35:33] <+Th3SmartAlec> Nothing!
[0:35:33] <Dragon_Batman> Yea like an hour of that is like leaving it in the inventory on break
[0:35:34] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> WHAT'S IN THE BOX?
[0:35:36] <alcors_wisdom> dongle
[0:35:42] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @TeraMercier made a new save file and played up to the point in his original save

[0:36:03] <+Fantion> @thepiefoot Thanks!
[0:36:04] <happyface699> As Leon will not fuck Clair. Chris now relies on the ustanak from re 6 to tell Jake to fuck chris sister and impregnate her with his superpower wesker seed.

[0:36:22] <%wolfofsound> Pat does that anyways
[0:36:23] <$SidBoyTM> @thepiefoot So wait, if the 100 series were the successful ones, why aren't there more than one? I feel like a lot of shit would have been done if they just mass dropped like, 50 of them in a given city.
[0:36:24] <crazy_laughter> We love you regardles
[0:36:25] <Gigigear21 > don't use any of that stuff woolie you might need it later
[0:36:27] <dimensaur> I actually just got to the end of the youtube videos last night
[0:36:33] <ElenaManetta> Is there a reason why PAUSE MENU doesn't pause the time? Are the developers like, "Item management should count towards the total"
[0:36:34] <gustavozxd> "eeh i can see that" looks back at the detroit LP LUL
[0:36:40] <valanway_diabolos> I hate fake pause screens
[0:36:42] <$SidBoyTM> Unless they're super hard to control, which I would assume would be a major issue.
[0:36:44] <%QueequegTheater> sucksed
[0:36:49] <MarylandJutsu> LAST TIME, on ADA WAIT
[0:36:49] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Sucks...es...ted
[0:36:52] <SomeDwarf> @SidBoyTM There's an island where they mass produce Mr. X, but I don't think it's canon
[0:36:54] <devanmuse> Does anyone else hear a purring in the background? Did Woolie get a particularly affectionate cat?
[0:36:56] <CalderGaming> @SidBoyTM the thing about the stuff that really works is that it can be expensive and time-consuming to make
[0:37:02] <takokasa> boxzDerp boxzDerp boxzUwU boxzDerp
[0:37:07] <Dragon_Batman> You technically haven't entered the sewers yet
[0:37:10] <simulationbard> I just saw an endgame ad on TV that contacted clips from the CLIMAX OF THE MOVIE. Why do people make trailers like this
[0:37:11] <thepiefoot> @SidBoyTM There IS more "Mr Xsseses". I believe the canon goes that only one Mr X was dropped in the police station
[0:37:13] <+Fantion> Might as well call this whole game an homage
[0:37:15] <%TeraMercier> I got so neurotic for all my first 4 plays of this game to make sure to only ever pause with start, now that I've gotten my speeds down it's still a weird tick I can't remember to stop
[0:37:17] <%garbocardboardington> Leon makes it to the end of the game and comes across a muscular skeleton, a camera, binoculars, and a box of assorted condoms.
[0:37:17] <$SidBoyTM> @CalderGaming But umbrella has all the monies
[0:37:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> leon and ada had sex in a sewer?
[0:37:19] <SomeDwarf> In the original RE2 a helicopter with 6 tubes drops one and that's where Mr. X comes from so there ARE more
[0:37:22] <rytisone> oh man, framerate on ps4 is so much worse than on pc
[0:37:22] <gustavozxd> @ElenaManetta yeah that's exactly it actually
[0:37:24] <alcors_wisdom> lol did you guys see that david cage just tweeted that detroit become human changed his life it was so good :omegalul:
[0:37:35] <MarylandJutsu> freakig Cage
[0:37:36] <%rumtumtugnutz> fucking how you get pink eye
[0:37:38] <+Th3SmartAlec> Oh boy
[0:37:39] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Wait what
[0:37:39] <thepiefoot> @SidBoyTM REUC (? has more Mr. Xeses too
[0:37:43] <$cureneckbeard> oops i made the bad game
[0:37:43] <insaneintentionsyo> terrifying
[0:37:43] <%topendbuzz> oh boy
[0:37:45] <+SolidusRex> Both RE2 and FFVII have some of my favorite pre-rendered backgrounds ever
[0:37:46] <big_chugnus> Poop
[0:37:48] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Oh COME ON I THOUGHT WE WERE STARTING AT 8
[0:37:49] <SailingSaturn> @simulationbard Because Marketing people are dumb and think people are dumb
[0:37:57] <marvel877> BACK TO WALL HUGGING.
[0:37:58] <$SidBoyTM> @thepiefoot That makes sense
[0:38:02] <thepiefoot> @SomeDwarf I beleive that was a RE3 cutscene
[0:38:04] <+Th3SmartAlec> I would rather it be thots
[0:38:05] <%topendbuzz> nah it's fine
[0:38:07] <SnaKemuho> THOTS
[0:38:11] <CalderGaming> god i still need to play hellblade
[0:38:12] <Sphincter_Spelunker> oh fuck, playing pokemon at the same time and ran into a shiny. gonna be a good night, boys
[0:38:13] <+rdark_ksu> .....I talk to myself constantly
[0:38:15] <%TeraMercier> I fucking fucking love expressed personality from my characters instead of generic player
[0:38:15] <Nina96> @Youwereeatenbyalid dont worry we just started
[0:38:17] <bbomi1995> normal people talk to themselves
[0:38:18] <rytisone> thought bubbles appearing
[0:38:18] <MarylandJutsu> @SailingSaturn i mean I only saw earlier trailers and they didn't spoil me at all
[0:38:19] <@Menitta> I would not play Days Gone then lol
[0:38:20] <+mans51> people talk when they're scared
[0:38:22] <alexandrecau> Horror characters should be like cursing or weeping under their breath
[0:38:22] <Dragon_Batman> Remember map screen shows if you collected items or finished puzzles
[0:38:24] <gustavozxd> out loud? yeah it's dumb, would be better if it were like ace attorney
[0:38:24] <NotHereToStream> sometimes its a coping mechanism
[0:38:26] <MarylandJutsu> oh god Days Gone
[0:38:26] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I talk to myself, sometimes, but I getcha
[0:38:27] <marvel877> LOGIC RUINS NARRATIVES.
[0:38:28] <%garbocardboardington> im fine, as long as its a short thing, not like a damn monolauge
[0:38:32] <Aydarkzero> it happens sometimes
[0:38:32] <insaneintentionsyo> G it sure is quiet
[0:38:32] <Brother_Coduss> @WoolieVersus because some people talk to themselves during times of stress as an attempt at self reassurance
[0:38:32] <$Mighty_observer> BEGONE THOUGHT
[0:38:33] <%TeraMercier> Hearing that echo voice is way more immersion shattering to me

[0:38:59] <happyface699> Same woolie
[0:39:01] <CryptusMaximus> That's why I love taking breaks between RE games. Its like a factory reset on your knowledge of the game.
[0:39:01] <alcors_wisdom> its mostly just when lickers are around that talking is an issue
[0:39:01] <+templar010> If I didnt talk to myself I would go crazy
[0:39:02] <$cureneckbeard> WHO'S TALKING
[0:39:03] <+Omegaanimus> Ever narrate someone else's life? Just narrate everything they do
[0:39:04] <%TeraMercier> Well this isn't really a noise intensive situation, Woolie
[0:39:04] <rytisone> its so weird when you get caught
[0:39:05] <ScreamingMeat> I'm such a dick, and I have to let myself know that.

[0:39:09] <knyttstories> Who DOESN'T talk to themselves?
[0:39:10] <alexandrecau> If your life is in danger SHOUT FOR HELP WOOLIE
[0:39:10] <ElenaManetta> Human reaction is unpredictable. Laughing while in life-threatening situations isn't abnormal.
[0:39:10] <mesamus> RELOAD WOOLIE
[0:39:10] <Dingo_Eejit> !RlSK AT RlSK!
[0:39:12] <@mothmandraws> intimidate the enemy
[0:39:12] <Greywolf47> it's weirder if you don't talk to yourself.
[0:39:14] <$SidBoyTM> People who talk to themselves on a daily basis are super smart
[0:39:16] <%Aussie_Manny> CAAAAAAAARL
[0:39:17] <+SolidusRex> CORAL
[0:39:17] <+Justlaxy> I don't know how audio mixing works but inner dialogue, with monsters, and explosions all at once seems hard.
[0:39:18] <%Aussie_Manny> D:
[0:39:20] <Zaphire_Saucypants> they go, "Metal gear, metal gear."
[0:39:20] <+CJett92> COOOOOORAL!
[0:39:21] <+PenmanLupine> Woolie's doing the thing where he doesn't understand human behavior
[0:39:21] <+dukenux> CORAL

[0:39:30] <dimensaur> I dunno I liked this last season
[0:39:32] <EuropantLamprey> Carl: Yo, what you want Wool-man?
[0:39:32] <CptBritches> We thought you was a toad!
[0:39:32] <%garbocardboardington> Coral@
[0:39:34] <stabbityrabbit> So Woolie never wants to be hiding next to Ryuji, got it.

[0:39:35] <happyface699> CORALLllllll
[0:39:35] <@Menitta> Again, dont play Days Gone
[0:39:37] <%lewdskeletor13> CARLLLL
[0:39:38] <Sphincter_Spelunker> It's an outer monologue
[0:39:39] <%TeraMercier> What about him talking shit to the zombies? I love them both
[0:39:40] <%yeknomlive> I talk to myself to calm myself too
[0:39:41] <gustavozxd> "a keycard, NICE!"
[0:39:42] <thelonechris> CORAL
[0:39:43] <+CourtInjustice> This last season was actually really good
[0:39:45] <thepiefoot> Fuck off, Woolie. Leon taliing to himself is really cool
[0:39:49] <SomeDwarf> Days Gone has one cool thing
[0:39:49] <CalderGaming> degunk your map, kids
[0:39:51] <crazy_laughter> Stress brings out nervous habits, like talking to yourself
[0:39:51] <zeroraider> are you narrating or is your skeleton flesh pilot narrating...?
[0:39:52] <KZN02> That's so coral
[0:39:55] <R3c0n31> Wolfeinstein version?
[0:39:57] <chris_da_wire> Let Woolie learn from his mistakes.
[0:39:57] <+dukenux> The one narrative device in video games i;m tired off is goddamn voicetapes.
[0:40:00] <CerberusDriver> Has anyone read that Games Biz Star Citizen article
[0:40:04] <Nina96> did days gone come out already?
[0:40:06] <%wolfofsound> He would really like HXH then, all the context and feelings are explained by the narrator
[0:40:07] <@Menitta> Walking Dead is a repeating plot like a fuckin shonen
[0:40:08] <Dragon_Batman> The knoife is back
[0:40:08] <happyface699> It‚Äôs a starfish coral
[0:40:08] <%garbocardboardington> @Menitta its only the first 5 hours that suck, after that its pretty gud
[0:40:09] <MarylandJutsu> @Menitta all i had to see was the protag wearing a backwards cap to his wedding and the line "I want you to ride me like you do you motorcycle"
[0:40:11] <%Itselguapo> The stupid kid in walking dead when they are all walking around and acting like zombies and the one kid says super loudly, "mooooommmmmyyyyyy....."
[0:40:11] <Zaphire_Saucypants> oh god, voice taper recordings
[0:40:12] <+uncledickbutt> also leon has to talk as a king of cringe
[0:40:17] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @dukenux detective vision for me, chief
[0:40:20] <+uncledickbutt> it's his duty

[0:42:20] <MarylandJutsu> WAHOOO PIZZA
[0:42:20] <%Aussie_Manny> Shit's locked.
[0:42:21] <%topendbuzz> woohoo pizza time
[0:42:23] <hypecactuar> Pizza time!!!!
[0:42:26] <chris_da_wire> Its a band playing in the WH yard
[0:42:26] <GUNxSPECTRE> This heat makes me wish for a nuclear winter
[0:42:27] <Youwereeatenbyalid> what's an AWP Whore?
[0:42:28] <mastermidget23> It's the youtube rewind so you wont feel bad about the apocalypse.
[0:42:28] <+Fantion> Also leads to some problems with the upkeep. like a door was propped up with a fucking crowbar
[0:42:29] <+StampyKnowsGaming> I'm 23, and still have LOTS of VHS Tapes. I love VHS tapes. Nostalgia is powerful, man. Also, the first HD Home content was produced on VHS, which is NUTS!
[0:42:30] <%garbocardboardington> wacky woo-hoo pizza time?
[0:42:32] <%illicitdonut> Don't forget to rewind!
[0:42:32] <pive123456> @woolieversus yeah it's just an orchestra playing
[0:42:33] <+Th3SmartAlec> jiggly
[0:42:35] <+dukenux> You're late, i'm not paying for those.
[0:42:35] <%Itselguapo> "When it's all over play this" and it's captain america flipping a chair sitting on the chair like, "Soo.... the world has ended, you messed up, but that's ok...."
[0:42:36] <wydamn> Fun fact: 30% of people today who purchase vinyl records don't actually have a record player. We live in a weird time.
[0:42:38] <+ThatGuyfromMars> during the cold war, it's wasn't creepy to think about, it was something that could happen
[0:42:39] <%TeraMercier> This hall is lousy with annoying motherfuckers
[0:42:41] <MarylandJutsu> WOOLIE LEARNED TO AIM
[0:42:48] <+Th3SmartAlec> dah Son of a bitch!
[0:42:50] <%Aussie_Manny> WASTED A BULLET D:
[0:42:51] <simulationbard> It's CNN and it's a crappy video of a band playing "Nearing My God to Me" aka the song that was reportedly played as the Titanic went down
[0:42:51] <%yeknomlive> what makes that pizza time video the best is the heart thumps
[0:42:51] <chris_da_wire> PJSalt Leon
[0:42:52] <Dingo_Eejit> just Chris Morris not saying goodnight, just sayin...
[0:42:54] <Parapattern> Boo-hoo pizza time for depressed eater Dante
[0:42:55] <+Taglog7> up tit?
[0:42:56] <CalderGaming> @stabbityrabbit i can chime in here and say that one of the more annoying things was adjusting the tracking
[0:42:57] <%topendbuzz> take that w=wall
[0:42:57] <happyface699> People have forgotten ghetto blasters surely
[0:42:57] <gustavozxd> the fact that someone genuinely has safety precautions to THE END OF THE WORLD is pretty scary
[0:42:58] <%TeraMercier> I like that patient confident controlling
[0:42:58] <%QueequegTheater> Woolie became a big boi shoote
[0:42:58] <mastermidget23> @MarylandJutsu You jinxed it immediately!
[0:42:59] <GUNxSPECTRE> Buy moar amp-tubes people
[0:43:01] <Dragon_Batman> Yea the practice paid off
[0:43:01] <gigacanuck> @stabbityrabbit well we didn't know there could be anything better, so it seemed pretty good at the time
[0:43:03] <big_chugnus> THat wasn't a zombie it was just a black guy
[0:43:04] <MarylandJutsu> @mastermidget23 IM SORRy
[0:43:04] <$SidBoyTM> The woolz gained a level in firearms
[0:43:05] <+Th3SmartAlec> Woolie's been grinding off screen
[0:43:05] <%IDTheftVictim> apatCrazy
[0:43:06] <alcors_wisdom> "in case of end of the world break glass" and its just a microphish with dante saying "whoohoo pizza" for 10 minutes
[0:43:07] <+SolidusRex> I think CNN once said that they planned on broadcasting Nearer My God To Thee" should the world begin to end
[0:43:08] <thepiefoot> @StampyKnowsGaming When i found out that 4:3 VHS tapes were cutting off part of the sides i was bamboozled
[0:43:09] <reiju_22> LUL
[0:43:09] <zajoestar> all that apex practice
[0:43:10] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> JINX
[0:43:10] <+uncledickbutt> jinxed it
[0:43:11] <%TeraMercier> Seems like Woolie was a lot more comfortable practicing off screen
[0:43:11] <Youwereeatenbyalid> She talks crazy talk
[0:43:12] <@mothmandraws> its because clearly the delay in this LP was them hiring someone to play the game and they are just talking over
[0:43:13] <%garbocardboardington> "Sheeeeeit" Leon s. Kenedy -1998
[0:43:14] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Don't worry, Woolie's just gaming that dynamic difficulty by missing shots
[0:43:15] <+dukenux> Must be all that TF|2
[0:43:15] <%Aussie_Manny> Pat, you ruined it
[0:43:15] <Dturner91> Still the same
[0:43:17] <Greywolf47> Crazy talk
[0:43:17] <+NobleJedi> apatCrazy apatCrazyhead
[0:43:18] <rytisone> pro strats
[0:43:19] <SnaKemuho> play those footsies
[0:43:20] <+Th3SmartAlec> Oh man Woolie, you're doing so good, I'm so impressed
[0:43:21] <%TeraMercier> Crazy Talk, Pat, that's what he's complaining about
[0:43:22] <crazy_laughter> immediately fucked it up
[0:43:22] <Dragon_Batman> Despite the misses it is better than the first stream
[0:43:22] <+uncledickbutt> crazy talk ON
[0:43:23] <Youwereeatenbyalid> a calculated ruse
[0:43:23] <+solzan2000> lol
[0:43:24] <+king_ghidrahh> CRAZY TALK
[0:43:25] <thetruenicster> nah, that was [Crazy Talk]
[0:43:25] <gustavozxd> yeah Kappa
[0:43:25] <+FloorBurger> Crazy Talk is warming up.
[0:43:26] <+Taglog7> Complimenter's curse
[0:43:27] <Zooperton> crazy talk actively attacks woolie's aim
[0:43:27] <big_chugnus> Great work Wollie!
[0:43:29] <%wolfofsound> Is this the work of an enemy stand?!
[0:43:29] <chris_da_wire> Rin the rutt
[0:43:30] <happyface699> Crazy talk
[0:43:30] <$FuqBoiSlim> she talks crazy talk

[0:43:39] <%Mr_Plate_Of_Soup> Crazy Talk is at it again!
[0:43:42] <Dingo_Eejit> gotta proc them lucky bullets
[0:43:45] <@mothmandraws> cant believe woolie hired skullgod to do all this gameplay and they are just miming
[0:43:50] <$cureneckbeard> „ÄåCRAZY TALK„Äç
[0:43:51] <zajoestar> tons of knives
[0:43:51] <thepiefoot> I can't believe Woolie is going at a REASONABLE pace PogChamp
[0:43:51] <%TeraMercier> I always killed with the knife on the floor and never got tagged if I was attacking the legs
[0:43:51] <+dukenux> Gotta save that ammo
[0:43:52] <alcors_wisdom> crazy talk is essential the same as doppios power its just pat doesnt have hair to see into the future with
[0:43:54] <MarylandJutsu> @Dingo_Eejit antique bullets
[0:43:55] <gustavozxd> knifing downed zombies has a chance of getting them up
[0:44:00] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @WoolieVersus but woolie, you're supposed to USE consumables!
[0:44:02] <%QueequegTheater> you might need this knife later
[0:44:05] <chris_da_wire> #Pattalkscrazy
[0:44:06] <+Th3SmartAlec> @mothmandraws he hired Snoop
[0:44:13] <$cureneckbeard> frame perfect
[0:44:18] <Radregice_> plug monkaS
[0:44:18] <G0DKnight> OH SHIT!
[0:44:19] <+Th3SmartAlec> ...What's a Chess piece?
[0:44:21] <AlvinTheLiar> Whats a rook?
[0:44:22] <$laphyrion> Man, FUCK the 2nd run version of the chess puzzle.
[0:44:23] <Dragon_Batman> uh oh
[0:44:23] <Sphincter_Spelunker> know where all the knives are at so you don't have to use ammo you'll "need" for later
[0:44:24] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Good old chess puzzle
[0:44:25] <gigacanuck> gee I wonder where that thing gets used
[0:44:27] <%QueequegTheater> That makes NO SENSE
[0:44:28] <+dukenux> WHAT THE-
[0:44:30] <thepiefoot> It was barely a puzzle in the original
[0:44:35] <%TeraMercier> Is that like checkers for old people
[0:44:36] <chris_da_wire> KEGS
[0:44:39] <%garbocardboardington> Great Googly Moogly
[0:44:40] <Djinnazz> BLIND
[0:44:41] <MarylandJutsu> Sound is coming FROM PAT
[0:44:41] <%wolfofsound> monkaS
[0:44:42] <EuropantLamprey> Is a Rook a Fortnight character?
[0:44:44] <+Th3SmartAlec> @QueequegTheater Don't worry, there's a dumb explanation
[0:44:48] <@mothmandraws> its in your head head
[0:44:51] <@mothmandraws> zombie zombie
[0:44:58] <%QueequegTheater> I know.
[0:44:59] <%garbocardboardington> Yeowch
[0:45:01] <nsfcr1010> The guy on the ground.
[0:45:02] <+nharliecash> this area is actually a pain in the ass for claire
[0:45:02] <chris_da_wire> Drink a shot,every time Woolie misses
[0:45:04] <%QueequegTheater> It's still fucking dumb
[0:45:05] <%TeraMercier> Isn't Rook a Siege operator?
[0:45:05] <%Dr00_PhD> Woolie-Based Performance go down
[0:45:08] <gojirarads> #bringbacksuperbestfriends
[0:45:09] <CalderGaming> "gImmE Tim HOrton's" he growls
[0:45:09] <%wolfofsound> with your guns and your bombs~
[0:45:11] <+LymanAl> door stuck
[0:45:12] <alcors_wisdom> @EuropantLamprey no hes from apex seige 6
[0:45:13] <okiesensation> monkaW
[0:45:19] <+Judeknight> Ey RE2!
[0:45:20] <alexandrecau> rook is in rainbow six
[0:45:21] <gustavozxd> ive been playing dead rising lately and looking at this game now is pretty funny how frank punches a zombie 3 times and the zombie just dies
[0:45:22] <%topendbuzz> so when do the zombie become an idol group?
[0:45:23] <Bagelborn> does anyone else think the zombies sometimes sound like Donkey Kong?
[0:45:25] <TeamAMFer> Schie√ü dem fenster
[0:45:32] <chris_da_wire> DK Zed
[0:45:35] <thepiefoot> @nharliecash How so? SMG knee caps every zombie in 3 shots and you can fire nade the G creatures
[0:45:44] <%Aussie_Manny> @WoolieVersus So... you should play Leon and then Claire?
[0:45:49] <%garbocardboardington> I keep forgetting that this is STILL Woolies first playthrough
[0:45:56] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Disappointed in the lack of r34 for this game. Where's Annette? üò°
[0:45:57] <+nharliecash> this one room is annoying because theres like 6 zombies on the other side of one door
[0:46:01] <%TeraMercier> Gustav, Capcom puts out a gameplay diverse roster, isn't it nuts
[0:46:05] <chris_da_wire> K-BAR
[0:46:05] <happyface699> I kinda hate how much of a mess the story is
[0:46:08] <thepiefoot> There IS a manual flashlight mod
[0:46:10] <gustavozxd> I HATE auto flashlights
[0:46:11] <hypecactuar> IS THiS THE CULT OF WOOLIE
[0:46:11] <+LymanAl> Now that's a knife
[0:46:14] <insaneintentionsyo> big gross
[0:46:16] <%wolfofsound> that's not a knife~
[0:46:17] <EuropantLamprey> Delicious delicious knife
[0:46:21] <Greywolf47> better learn to draw if you want more r34
[0:46:23] <rytisone> dual wield
[0:46:23] <%garbocardboardington> Krauser be like "this is a knoife"
[0:46:23] <alcors_wisdom> k-bars are fucking expensive
[0:46:25] <%zenkiro_> zenkiro_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[0:46:27] <ElenaManetta> You ever get in that mentality of, "Oh, game from three months ago? THAT'S SO OLD"
[0:46:30] <Dragon_Batman> It was a good call really
[0:46:33] <%TeraMercier> Yeah, you're right, there haven't been a nearly legit amount of SFM videos
[0:46:35] <SirKamBam> Kombat Time
[0:46:35] <+SolidusRex> There was also a stun gun.
[0:46:37] <thetruenicster> well, Jill got a taser instead
[0:46:37] <PurePlatinumKyo> Jill also got a tazer
[0:46:37] <%ProfessorDetective052996> And a tazer.
[0:46:39] <gustavozxd> If my character has a flashlight i want to use it when I want
[0:46:45] <happyface699> pat people have a lot of problems with this game
[0:46:45] <chris_da_wire> Gretta Garbo
[0:46:46] <%rumtumtugnutz> that's Knife-chan. knife-chan is the best waifu.
[0:46:55] <Valentinius_Anodyne> R34 is an integral process of any person learning to draw after all
[0:46:55] <+nharliecash> SPLOOSH
[0:46:55] <+dukenux> wee
[0:46:55] <$cureneckbeard> hi knife
[0:46:57] <AlvinTheLiar> The maps you best friend down here Woolie

[0:47:02] <rytisone> its a slide
[0:47:03] <+dukenux> Yes Leon, it IS shit
[0:47:05] <%wolfofsound> pat's nightmare
[0:47:06] <%salty_syd913> the poop zone
[0:47:07] <%garbocardboardington> yum, poop water
[0:47:09] <$laphyrion> "IT SMELLS LIKE POO GAS DOWN HERE!"
[0:47:09] <+Fantion> Doing Claire first in my first playthrough. Only 3 hours in and got Mr X on my ass. Thought he would come in later
[0:47:13] <+RJay80> urgh shit
[0:47:14] <thepiefoot> Stop talking to yourself, Leon ! Woolie HATES that
[0:47:15] <alcors_wisdom> @rumtumtugnutz much like sawblade-chan but not quite as edgy
[0:47:22] <chris_da_wire> Whens Clementine?
[0:47:22] <insaneintentionsyo> oh boy
[0:47:25] <spacecatstreams> leon do a flip
[0:47:27] <%rumtumtugnutz> leon would have big pinkeye
[0:47:34] <+uncledickbutt> REmake scared me more than this but jump scares in RE2 were top
[0:47:35] <%Lion_kun> i'd say woolie could possibly beat the game today but then I remember it's woolie
[0:47:37] <Dragon_Batman> One was a hallway with spiders you just run by right?
[0:47:42] <chris_da_wire> Pats mom?
[0:47:47] <%TeraMercier> Frankly, I don't like sewer levels, cause the palette and content are gross. It's just a bummer of a locale
[0:47:50] <thetruenicster> GOD I hate these things
[0:47:52] <rytisone> Woolie once again descending into trash
[0:47:52] <+nharliecash> i forgot how good woolie as at controlling the camera
[0:47:55] <+dukenux> Is this where you fight Killer Croc?
[0:47:58] <garbageheaphound> oh boy time for the big fun
[0:47:58] <insaneintentionsyo> worst enemy
[0:47:58] <Nina96> PATS MOM RUN!
[0:48:00] <%Dr00_PhD> apatBig Worry

[0:48:04] <+Fantion> lmao, killler croc
[0:48:04] <alcors_wisdom> @Lion_kun naw end game is like 4 hours from now on a normal play through
[0:48:06] <@mothmandraws> wow they made it to blight town already
[0:48:07] <%TeraMercier> @nharliecash You've got it backwards
[0:48:07] <%garbocardboardington> Leon would smeel like dookie from this point forward, including when he meets ada again
[0:48:09] <thepiefoot> You can ran past the G creatures
[0:48:11] <chris_da_wire> CrazyTalk
[0:48:12] <+Th3SmartAlec> @thetruenicster Yeah, they're resource sponges
[0:48:15] <+starkandstag> Kappa
[0:48:18] <SomeDwarf> If you knock out a leg they just fall into the water and die
[0:48:19] <%garbocardboardington> Hush
[0:48:20] <MajorCrasher> CRAZY TALK
[0:48:20] <%Tangolikeoak> Is this anor londo?
[0:48:22] <%Aussie_Manny> This sewer's better lit than the Battle of Winterfell, to be fair.
[0:48:26] <%Lion_kun> i could do it in 2 but it's woolie so it'll take 8
[0:48:27] <happyface699> Crazy talk
[0:48:29] <valriot> Arya gonna one shot Mr.X
[0:48:30] <%TeraMercier> Does that mean that if you pop the leg of the zombie in the sewer water it'll auto die?
[0:48:35] <happyface699> DAWN OF THE DEAD
[0:48:38] <SomeDwarf> Yes @TeraMercier
[0:48:38] <%garbocardboardington> the new londo waterpark opens TODAY!
[0:48:39] <MarylandJutsu> that guys a MANIAC. WHYD HE BITE ME
[0:48:40] <crazy_laughter> Wouldn't zombies float
[0:48:40] <thepiefoot> The sewer is better lit than the last episode of GOT
[0:48:43] <Prevot> why would zombies on the ocean floor not just get eaten by fish?
[0:48:43] <Dragon_Batman> LUL
[0:48:46] <%jinking79> dawn of the dead did it

[0:48:50] <alcors_wisdom> if they were walking around on the ocean floor they'd get crushed by the preasure
[0:48:51] <%QueequegTheater> Swimming with the human body is actually surprising complex
[0:48:52] <Dragon_Batman> boo

[0:49:04] <%TeraMercier> Wow, that's like, the tiniest reward for a very specific degree of obscured accuracy
[0:49:05] <SnaKemuho> and then the dead didn't even leave the North Keepo
[0:49:05] <Greywolf47> we need more zombie fishes.
[0:49:06] <CptBritches> HERE HE COME

[0:50:40] <worldbrand> Moneybags required
[0:50:42] <%Aussie_Manny> Bruh, that was an EXPENSIVE blob.
[0:50:45] <+Tearonex> big boys with big poise
[0:50:45] <MarylandJutsu> OR run past them?
[0:50:47] <$cureneckbeard> bye knife
[0:50:47] <+Justlaxy> These boiz taught me that running was the way to go.
[0:50:49] <%TeraMercier> Fuck yeah grenades
[0:50:51] <+Judeknight> I still struggle with dodging them
[0:50:51] <thetruenicster> im glad we all agree the G Adults are The Worst
[0:50:56] <%garbocardboardington> A disgusting Bleub
[0:50:57] <+FloorBurger> Shoot colostomy bags for BIG damage
[0:50:57] <@mothmandraws> grenade parry
[0:50:57] <happyface699> @parapattern You shoot zombies in there so there heads explode
[0:50:58] <+Th3SmartAlec> Best way to fight these guys? Don't
[0:50:59] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Much like real life, eyeballs are always a weak-point

[0:51:04] <%lewdskeletor13> lewdskeletor13 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Howdy Pat and Woolie! Love you guys! Gearbox really needs to drop Randy. He's like Rhonda in MK11, everytime he talks I want him to shut up. Also Woolie tell pat to stream Tales from the Borderlands!
[0:51:06] <%TeraMercier> Does it do more tangible damage to throw one at them instead of defend?
[0:51:08] <+nharliecash> i think that doctors once found an eye inside a tumor and shinji mikami must have thought that was the tightest shit
[0:51:10] <chris_da_wire> LB
[0:51:18] <%garbocardboardington> I wouldnt want MY colostomy bag getting shot
[0:51:19] <thepiefoot> @TeraMercier Throwing does more damage
[0:51:24] <+C24U> 2 flame rounds kills them for Claire easy
[0:51:24] <+Fantion> RB
[0:51:28] <%TeraMercier> Hit the colostomy bag with a grenade for maximum shame

[0:51:53] <Shini6arcane> ive seen enough hentai to know where this is going
[0:51:53] <alcors_wisdom> grenades do more damage thrown than they do as a defensive move

[1:02:55] <jorgeniev> @WoolieVersus should RE outbreak get a remake?
[1:03:02] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Calek I guess you can consider it a logic puzzle, maybe? I used to do a lot of those when I was younger
[1:03:04] <thepiefoot> @overlordkog I've read it too, i am not 100% worried since a lot of the assets already exist and OG RE3 was also handled by a different team
[1:03:04] <MarylandJutsu> @akuda_bar i mean the same could be said of the Statue in the police station

[1:10:14] <%TeraMercier> Woolie the non reader confirmed

[1:10:32] <Th3rd3> Remington
[1:10:34] <+dukenux> and two smoking barrels
[1:10:35] <technicstars> the fact that leon talks to himself is what made me purchase this game literally just now
[1:10:36] <Graxe_> And it's a great shotgun
[1:10:38] <Tampaoster> Super shotgun
[1:10:39] <siamzero94> i did
[1:10:39] <SirKamBam> You did it.
[1:10:39] <gigacanuck> unlocked: bestest shotgun

[1:10:48] <gigacanuck> the fastest shotgun
[1:10:49] <thepiefoot> @ThatGuyfromMars G4 was a nightmare, the fucker didn't go down fast enough and he ruined my S+ run
[1:10:50] <Dragon_Batman> Now it's headshot everytime

[1:10:53] <%TeraMercier> Just open up on a motherfucker
[1:10:55] <+ThatGuyfromMars> seems like it's just you @tungstenviper

[1:11:05] <chris_da_wire> Pat is a Gun nut?
[1:11:05] <$laphyrion> Use that badboy for a high chance of head-pops.
[1:11:06] <StarkAvKnark> maximum boomstick
[1:11:07] <Graxe_> The classic RE2 upgraded shotgun had the better boom sound, though.
[1:11:11] <+uncledickbutt> no shut up
[1:11:11] <kryedge> Pat, do you plan to read JoJo soon? Part 8 is turning out to be an insane bizarre adventure
[1:11:12] <CryptusMaximus> Fun tip: Safe directions don't matter, just as long as you alternate them.
[1:11:12] <CptBritches> It's a vidya game
[1:11:14] <ZephynM> Speed because the stock helps keep the gun steady after firing.
[1:11:17] <KgKid51> S P. E. E. D
[1:11:22] <natebud> Managing recoil makes it easier to fire faster.
[1:11:22] <+ThatGuyfromMars> @thepiefoot and that's why I won't do it, that and the 2 hr max
[1:11:24] <Ahack13> No guys, thats how that gun works IN REAL LIFE
[1:11:26] <+doc_ock_rokc> @WoolieVersus You stablize your shot faster so you can headshot the zombies

[1:11:29] <defaultname3887> Testing
[1:11:31] <gigacanuck> I mean, it's no DOOM Super Shotgun
[1:11:33] <$SidBoyTM> spEEd
[1:11:35] <Reverend_Roscoe> REDUCED RECOIL MEANS YOU ARE ON TARGET FASTER
[1:11:37] <Graxe_> Guns are a controlled explosion in your hands
[1:11:38] <+countgaculatv> It's faster aiming
[1:11:39] <+chaumiester> Guns... in real life or guns in this game?
[1:11:39] <%TeraMercier> It means you can put more directed force into your pump instead of using inefficient hand pumping
[1:11:40] <SomeDwarf> They did, but I think there's another one you can do.
[1:11:41] <tungstenviper> @ThatGuyfromMars cool... always happy to know that interent problems are only my side :(
[1:11:41] <alexandrecau> it's a gun woolie
[1:11:45] <MajorCrasher> the pistol stock gives it burst fire
[1:11:46] <alexandrecau> the gun is weird
[1:11:47] <%TeraMercier> Pistol grip pumping that is
[1:11:47] <Brother_Coduss> @WoolieVersus how are guns weird pat? you point, pull trigger, make boom and someone dies
[1:11:48] <Dragon_Batman> Going through the floor while grabbed?

[2:21:09] <+Shotgundam009> Sonic was filmed in Uganda
[2:21:11] <sir_nack> I really don't expect anyone who worked on writing that movie would even know what ugandan knuckles is
[2:21:11] <siamzero94> that would make slighty more tolerable
[2:21:13] <+pkmamsters> AFTER CREDITS: "Sir, there's a disturbance in Uganda." "Show me..."
[2:21:14] <$Louie_Salmon> @teramercier Sanic is a shirt in Sonic forces and the guy who animated tails gets tricked did the Mania intro, there is no distinction anymore.

[2:21:19] <Youwereeatenbyalid> holy shit that movie is going to be such a trashfire

[2:25:28] <+duskrush> Overthinking it
[2:25:29] <+dukenux> God, Dead Space flamethrower was so shit
[2:25:29] <Junkfist> I always thought it was weird that one time in the cartoon Sonic looked directly at the audience and said "liberalism is moral degeneracy" before spindashing
[2:25:29] <chris_da_wire> Woolie will screw up the flame
[2:25:32] <Dragon_Batman> Woolie no Logic isn't as strong here
[2:25:32] <siamzero94> g-monsters and plants are best
[2:25:33] <Graxe_> Fire only hurts you when it is shot at you
[2:25:33] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Fill those zombies with your burning love
[2:25:34] <alexandrecau> gun woolie
[2:25:36] <+thebonebard> burned brain
[2:25:37] <+dukenux> only good for one type of enemies
[2:25:39] <Graxe_> Or when it explodes
[2:25:44] <+Jessie_Lockhart> ‚ÄúFlaming hobos‚Äù - Cloverfield
[2:25:44] <RiceeFTW> the longer you hold it, the more damage tho
[2:25:46] <dsauce999> but what about trickster tho
[2:25:47] <Froyuken> Yeah, they Nerfed this weapon hard.
[2:25:47] <+lordfunkyfist> But what do the burning zombies do on Gunslinger mode
[2:25:49] <%TeraMercier> So maybe use it on more complicated enemies
[2:25:50] <$laphyrion> YOU PUT THAT FLAMETHROWER AWAY RIGHT NOW!
[2:25:52] <chris_da_wire> YEA
[2:25:53] <eldragon_1> It's a GUN
[2:25:56] <RiceeFTW> oh but yeah it was nerfed
[2:25:57] <%khalcipher> YEa
[2:25:58] <majindusto> YES
[2:26:00] <+TruSpindash> Yes
[2:26:01] <Hiro01231> yes
[2:26:02] <+shiplord13> In this game yeah
[2:26:03] <El_Desperad0> don't spoil, chat
[2:26:03] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Woolie's Weakness is his own Galaxy Brain
[2:26:03] <dsauce999> YES
[2:26:04] <CptBritches> It's a video game, not real life
[2:26:04] <KazMkII> Yes
[2:26:05] <+duskrush> yep
[2:26:05] <DeadNinja1> No
[2:26:06] <subSenpai> yes
[2:26:08] <Dragon_Batman> No but this game is wacky
[2:26:08] <Froyuken> You'll definitely need it later.

[2:26:14] <Sloavon> no smoilers SHH
[2:26:15] <siamzero94> woolie why
[2:26:17] <$Louie_Salmon> You really have to hold it for it to be useful
[2:26:18] <+thebonebard> i feel like a flamethrower would actually be dangerous as fuck to real zombies, pretty sure flamethrowers shoot flaming liquids that would go right through flesh
[2:26:18] <thepiefoot> Doesn't it do DOT ?
[2:26:20] <+thesw1tch> lol
[2:26:23] <chris_da_wire> Woolie tunes out PAT
[2:26:23] <%Mr_Plate_Of_Soup> Woolie never overthinks anything in Resident Evil.
[2:26:25] <Graxe_> So when does Dante get a flamethrower?
[2:26:26] <+dukenux> @lewdskeletor13 It's a gun

[2:26:41] <natebud> It's decent when zombies are bunched up and you don't really have to aim.
[2:26:42] <diegoleaobr> Target I mean
[2:26:42] <%QueequegTheater> WHAT DOES IT DO IN TRICKSTER THO
[2:26:45] <%TeraMercier> Using a flamethrower in any of the hallways of this game would be a massive clusterfuck
[2:26:46] <dsauce999> What about Swordmaster tho?
[2:26:48] <$cureneckbeard> THIS IS A FLAMMENWERFER it WERFS FLAMMEN
[2:26:50] <lloyddboy> UNGH

[2:32:17] <Dragon_Batman> You just practice it
[2:32:20] <+duskrush> Hesitance is nature's input lag
[2:32:21] <ospreyworks> This area is the coolest, nastiest thing they added to the game.
[2:32:25] <Junkfist> Wesker only wanted those photos of Rebecca because he's really into basketball.
[2:32:28] <$laphyrion> @DrkJP520 He's in jail.

[2:33:42] <+doc_ock_rokc> @WoolieVersus darksouls
[2:33:44] <Froyuken> This one.
[2:33:44] <%lewdskeletor13> The spark gun is really good against them

[2:33:55] <natebud> Oh no. What will Woolie do without all his magnum ammo!? Kappa
[2:34:08] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Spark is also awesome, but best when the eye is exposed
[2:34:15] <siamzero94> Flame should be used primarily in the next section anyways
[2:34:22] <+duskrush> The irony is that I'm overprotective of my magnum ammo and nothing else
[2:34:26] <Prevot> but what if I need it laaaaater
[2:34:26] <ospreyworks> Leon with the short-sleeved shirt < the long-sleeved uniform. It looks just a little too dorky to me.

[2:38:40] <+Nomicro4u> SUB OPTIMAL
[2:38:41] <corepercentlives> Given how much resi characters can resist wounds and fatal shots umbrella should research them and screw the viruses
[2:38:45] <wydamn> Woolie, you should get attacked more to maximize your healing potential.
[2:38:45] <rytisone> unless you get combo'd
[2:38:46] <%TeraMercier> But Woolie's aim has improved so much that it's almost like he's playing on assisted

[3:09:51] <%GohanEgret> patdiculous
[3:09:54] <Dragon_Batman> 1 flash might be good
[3:09:55] <Sloavon> hey guys should I get P5D? I liked the demo
[3:10:03] <%QueequegTheater> no
[3:10:05] <%QueequegTheater> yes
[3:10:08] <%QueequegTheater> idk
[3:10:09] <%rumtumtugnutz> I'll show you ridiculous
[3:10:09] <Dragon_Batman> Shure why not
[3:10:10] <life404> maybe
[3:10:11] <diegoleaobr> Pat is just jealous of the Woolie powerhouse I say
[3:10:11] <+thesw1tch> put the grenade away
[3:10:13] <+Shotgundam009> both
[3:10:19] <+duskrush> You probably don't need the magnum for the time being
[3:10:21] <$Louie_Salmon> If you big fuck-up THAT bad, you may as well die.
[3:10:26] <Dragon_Batman> you can make some Shottys
[3:10:29] <+thesw1tch> why
[3:10:38] <Dragon_Batman> or save for Mugnums
[3:10:38] <diegoleaobr> Now Pat, send him to the licker room
[3:10:42] <thepiefoot> High grade + high grade = Knife AMMO
[3:10:44] <%Dr00_PhD> @Sloavon If you like the characters and want more social link type stuff without any real plot relevance than yeah
[3:10:47] <thunderhog> @Sloavon It's pretty meh if you really like music games, but if you dont play them too much is a nice starter
[3:10:49] <%QueequegTheater> Put away at least two of those guns
[3:10:55] <gustavozxd> use the magnum ONLY FOR THE FINAL BOSS Kappa
[3:10:56] <+Talbz> @Sloavon Only if you REALLY REALLY like P5 and its music
[3:10:58] <zerocruz> Oh boy
[3:11:07] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Woolie, I don't think you need the magnum cause you don't need to fight a boss during map exploration
[3:11:10] <+SolidusRex> Stuff the Magnum
[3:11:11] <RiceeFTW> pat looks disgusted
[3:11:22] <+Talbz> @Sloavon I got maybe 10 hours in it before I got bored, so I'd say wait for a sale
[3:11:22] <Dragon_Batman> He should stuff the Mugnum
[3:11:25] <+Th3SmartAlec> ...all of them?
[3:11:31] <%QueequegTheater> PUT AWAY SOME GUNS
[3:11:32] <+korth367> this is actively killing pat
[3:11:36] <Froyuken> shh. Let him figure it out.
[3:11:37] <+SolidusRex> Put the Magnum in the box Woolie
[3:11:43] <%GohanEgret> carry more guns
[3:11:49] <+Irridium> but what if you need the guns for later?
[3:11:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> put the lotion in the basket
[3:12:00] <$Louie_Salmon> In my first playthrough ever I took Pat's advice to not carry healing ever and it was great, I never had inventory problems
[3:12:06] <+Th3SmartAlec> Woolie what do you need the weapons for when you're backtracking to get items
[3:12:13] <wydamn> Can Woolie figure THIS out?
[3:12:17] <Sloavon> thanks for the advice guys!

[3:12:32] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Let Pat feel the "what if I need them later" aura emanating from Woolie
[3:12:34] <zeroraider> material unaccounted for??

[3:13:45] <+duskrush> Hey Pat, I had a question: Are the UBCS purely cannon fodder or did they actually work for Umbrella?
[3:13:46] <$Louie_Salmon> Wait. Is Carrying 4 guns and 2 full heals the inverse of the "What if I need it Later" mentality, I.E. "What if I need it now"? Is that even a goblin?
[3:13:46] <knyttstories> Ignore all advice

[3:14:14] <AncelDeLambert> FUN doesn't have to be GOOD
[3:14:14] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:14:15] <Sphincter_Spelunker> writing, maybe. humor is dated as shit
[3:14:16] <thewellroundedgamer99> Dont forget the security room!

[3:14:29] <FujiSyusuke808Live> Borderlands has bad writing but good character building.
[3:14:29] <%ChoculaUltra> Pat, if you're reading this you are CURSED to do a Xenogears stream someday for no fucking reason.
[3:14:29] <Valentinius_Anodyne> The delay was because of the difficulty Pat had leaving the cube

[3:14:32] <corepercentlives> shoot his magnum to zero and overwrite all saves Kappa
[3:14:33] <InugamiTheHound> gearbox won't hire the original voice actor for claptrap
[3:14:33] <%guyalex> shoulda brought the cube for woolie
[3:14:34] <%QueequegTheater> Handsome Jack is a great villain

[3:14:42] <MattriX77> What is the chat feeling, Pat?
[3:14:42] <GoldeNOVA> Handsome Jack sucks
[3:14:43] <shurtal> If Borderlands 3 doesn't have a reference to a misplaced USB Dongle, I will be very disappointed

[3:31:40] <siamzero94> handgun away and get grenades or knife
[3:31:42] <InugamiTheHound> ebola is really bad and its worst because 3rd world countries don't have infrastructure to have clean water

[3:42:11] <+DocFish> watch out for the crimson heads
[3:42:15] <Pookiedaexzile> Pat doesn't have the Drip, that would require sauce, and for him to have sauce he needs flava
[3:42:15] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Mr. X was here. Leon is a loser
[3:42:16] <%ProfessorDetective052996> I just realized: that shotgun on Leon's back is like a full meter long. You'd expect that thing to fire ten gauge shells.

[0:01:31] <saiyan24675> Hello
[0:01:39] <Agami23> finally a good fighting game!
[0:01:42] <wohdin> magic circuit fuckery time?????
[0:01:45] <+krispen_wa> This better be streaming from Woolie's bathroom or this won't be a true MB experience
[0:01:46] <+jbaker009> the purest form of anime poverty
[0:01:46] <+radda343> yo it's time for melty blood
[0:01:48] <+CJett92> awwwww ye we're getting into that Fate shit
[0:01:56] <YakumoYomi> I guess Woolie figured it out (CCCaster, that is).
[0:02:07] <+krispen_wa> Aoko is best grill
[0:02:12] <+CJett92> ^^^^
[0:02:14] <HelluvaNohbody> Get into the bathrroom
[0:02:20] <Zelretch3000> SUGOI SUGOI
[0:02:25] <wohdin> man, don’t diss melty blood by relating it to fate
[0:02:37] <+jbaker009> they're made by same person
[0:02:37] <%Solidnick18> howdy woolieGIRLS
[0:02:37] <%TimetodiveLTX> "first"
[0:02:39] <+krispen_wa> It's too late, Sion is already in Fate
[0:02:52] <%Irridium> Well I tried setting up the community edition but it won't read my controls when I go through the launcher so I'm out
[0:02:54] <Zelretch3000> diss it by reminding us of Tsukihime anime
[0:02:55] <%TimetodiveLTX> god im drunk
[0:02:57] <%FuqBoiSlim> Melty Blood finally gets it's time. after being delayed TWICE
[0:02:57] <YakumoYomi> The Nasuverse is buckwild
[0:02:59] <+CJett92> It's only a matter of time before Caster Aoko becomes real
[0:03:03] <lem______> melty tyme
[0:03:07] <misterpans> Woolie will be made to answer for the time he called Ryougi boring
[0:03:13] <WishyWashyofSaddleArabia> Yo, I can't stick around for this, but i wanna say... I just discovered a couple of days ago I had a copy of Melty on Steam. I don't know the first thing about it, but I'm probably gonna watch the vod and be willing to mess with it. in the meantime, I've been having WAY TOO MUCH FUN with TFH 1.0
[0:03:15] <OkamiDude15> woolie vs tsukihime BACK IN
[0:03:18] <Merkensteiner> MELTY BOY UNITE
[0:03:19] <+krispen_wa> Warui ne
[0:03:23] <gekizenbu> @CJett92 you will never reach the collab, that is the power of [FATE/REQUIEM]
[0:03:25] <@Solidus_113> I didn't set up this rollback patch thing, can I still play online?
[0:03:28] <%laserbeaming> Meruti Brodo
[0:03:32] <+jbaker009> really fate is fine if u ignore every timeline that isn't Sakura
[0:03:39] <+CJett92> @gekizenbu Wha... Wha... Wha...
[0:03:54] <saiyan24675> Wait if we getting into fate stuff sorry Bois I’ve had enough of Nasu BS already with FGO and it Bs
[0:04:01] <MayorRev> ?schedule
[0:04:03] <wsintai> @jbaker009 My Saber Alter figure says otherwise
[0:04:05] <MayorRev> !schedule
[0:04:05] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1257528186524622851
[0:04:09] <etbarni> From the title I’m expecting anime fighting game.
[0:04:12] <%domokun124> domokun124 is gifting 5 Tier 1 Subs to WoolieVersus's community! They've gifted a total of 10 in the channel! 
[0:04:13] <%domokun124> domokun124 gifted a Tier 1 sub to iswearimjustdandy! 
[0:04:13] <%domokun124> domokun124 gifted a Tier 1 sub to a_little_big_guy! 
[0:04:13] <%domokun124> domokun124 gifted a Tier 1 sub to DaBigVitus! 
[0:04:13] <%domokun124> domokun124 gifted a Tier 1 sub to MonsterEnvy! 
[0:04:13] <%domokun124> domokun124 gifted a Tier 1 sub to JustCallTre! 
[0:04:22] <saiyan24675> I’m out kishimoto stuff I can handle
[0:04:25] <%DreyfussFrost> DreyfussFrost subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Oh fuck yeah is it finally time for bathroom finals?
[0:04:34] <YakumoYomi> Fate is fine because it has many quality waifus
[0:04:38] <knackirontarkus> I want to believe that the Tsukihime remake still exists
[0:04:40] <%TimetodiveLTX> don't make bathroom jokes the melty players hate it
[0:04:44] <+CJett92> @etbarni It's not quite Fate, but it is Fate adjacent
[0:04:49] <%DreyfussFrost> Not all of them
[0:04:53] <yamikami13> what is this? bathroom break?
[0:05:04] <wsintai> Waifu's are for cowards, true men love their husbandos EMIYA and First Hassan
[0:05:05] <%Jetzord> First time I'm able to participate, so excited to get my ass kicked
[0:05:05] <+krispen_wa> It's an offshoot of a visual novel that somehow has worse porn than Fate's
[0:05:08] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> So how about that Xbox conference huh?
[0:05:11] <+emeraldsplasher> Anyone know if this is gonna be just a normal Woolie Versus of GIFG? Also if they're not playing in a bathroom I'll be very disappointed
[0:05:17] <%optimasmaximas> like max said
[0:05:19] <%optimasmaximas> yikes
[0:05:27] <%DreyfussFrost> Besides, Melty Blood is the fighting game I have the most hours in by far.
[0:05:34] <%TimetodiveLTX> same
[0:05:45] <%TimetodiveLTX> i mean differwent
[0:06:00] <+krispen_wa> same difference
[0:06:05] <$BallerSwagBro9k> FATE GANG FATE GANG
[0:06:11] <%doughvatkyn> bathroom acoustics gotta be bad
[0:06:15] <Arek_1> I saw and I fucking clicked!
[0:06:31] <+krispen_wa> It's time to see a one-man Zoo
[0:06:46] <%DreyfussFrost> Turn on RTX Voice to filter out the flushing sound.
[0:06:53] <%laserbeaming> This game's name is just random words is it?
[0:06:55] <+CJett92> FATE GANG RISE UP
[0:07:03] <%Solidnick18> SourPls
[0:07:06] <OkamiDude15> SourPls
[0:07:08] <+RadDude6969> been itching to see what this game is like let's go
[0:07:18] <+emeraldsplasher> I sure hope they're in a bathroom if not, the disappointment will be real
[0:07:24] <%Diana869> PogChamp
[0:07:27] <Arek_1> Turns out the Woolie Hole was a toilet all along.
[0:07:31] <+7oasty> the only thing i like more than Fate is hating Fate
[0:07:32] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:07:35] <%optimasmaximas> gid i need to finish slogging through apocrypha so i can watch the good shit
[0:07:42] <PerfectShadic> FATE GANG YOYOYOYO
[0:07:54] <$arcielardor> Now the real question: will this be streamed from Woolie's bathroom?
[0:07:54] <+krispen_wa> why would you slog through something that is completely optional
[0:08:01] <OkamiDude15> say the line bart! "melty blood in the bathroom" nkoSad
[0:08:12] <misterpans> fuck apocrypha tbh
[0:08:17] <+CJett92> Yo, apocrypha really turns to shit, but that ONE episode tho, amirite? You know the one
[0:08:19] <%Wonderbot3000> Wonderbot3000 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! This better be filmed from the bathroom
[0:08:21] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> haha melty bathroom guys
[0:08:23] <%Thunderhog> woolieSHOOK
[0:08:28] <+emeraldsplasher> This better be in the bathroom
[0:08:28] <saiyan24675> @optimasmaximas did you already watch UBW and Zero cause I can tell you it’s all down hill from their

[0:08:39] <knackirontarkus> *shit
[0:08:55] <+krispen_wa> just read strange fake. it's apocrypha if it didn't suck
[0:09:02] <+CJett92> ^^^^^^
[0:09:04] <+CJett92> That
[0:09:04] <%domokun124> woolie should green screen his bathroom behind him
[0:09:06] <misterpans> ^
[0:09:08] <Ryong> AW YEAH MELTY BLOOD
[0:09:13] <eatmcdonalds> Grand Order tho
[0:09:14] <%DreyfussFrost> @laserbeaming Same developer as Under Night In-Birth Exe:Late[cl-r], so yeah.
[0:09:18] <%Thunderhog> God, i havn't touched melty in years. My C-Ciel probably sucks now
[0:09:21] <+emeraldsplasher> Remember, Woolie turned down two bisexual women to get Marvel vs Capcom 3
[0:09:22] <brunoberserk> get ready to nasuverse memes
[0:09:23] <Ryong> is the stream going to be inside the bathroom
[0:09:30] <+krispen_wa> UNREAL BLACK THINGS INCOMING
[0:09:31] <correctedsun117> Has Japan gone too far?
[0:09:32] <+CourageTheCat> If this stream doesn’t have a bathroom can then what’s the point
[0:09:34] <%optimasmaximas> @saiyan24675 i know it's downhill from there, that's why im saving zero for last lol; watched UBW first and heard extra/last encore and apocrypha suck
[0:09:37] <$arcielardor> @woolieversus Road to Boruto when?
[0:09:37] <+KageSenpaiLP> Shiki something something servants

[0:15:29] <@Menitta> I feel bad because I donated a code for the steam version
[0:15:30] <Agami23> netcode
[0:15:31] <+krispen_wa> CC Caster? but what about CC Assassin or CC Rider?
[0:15:33] <%Irridium> cccaster edition doesn't save my controls so I can't play :(
[0:15:34] <+7oasty> the H-scenes are unintentional comedy
[0:15:37] <OkamiDude15> @BallerSwagBro9k ah i picked xiang yu.
[0:15:41] <%FuqBoiSlim> @yulixup "Happy" scene 4Head
[0:15:41] <strayed42> if you don't like H scenes Stay/Night at least has Realta Nua which cuts them out
[0:15:45] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Nice
[0:15:47] <%0rond> the povertiest of the povertiest game in existance. HAS ROLLBACK NETCODE
[0:15:47] <misterpans> DEFENCELESS
[0:15:48] <Broand> hey wait a minute this isn't woolies bathroom
[0:15:55] <%TimetodiveLTX> a n u s
[0:15:56] <%Irridium> well, I say not save but apart from the d-pad and stick nothing reads so
[0:15:57] <+CJett92> DEFENSLESS
[0:16:06] <Frostydough1> Oh great, the blood is all melted
[0:16:07] <+7oasty> except Hollow Ataraxia, those ones are good
[0:16:11] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Still waiting for CCC Translation BibleThump
[0:16:16] <%Wool> POVERTY
[0:16:18] <+skm742> it's the location, not bathroom
[0:16:20] <%LymanAl> LymanAl subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! Lucky number 13, baby
[0:16:21] <whitemage4life> You cant hide your AMVs forever Woolie
[0:16:30] <$BallerSwagBro9k> SERENITY BEST GIR
[0:16:31] <+CJett92> You get better reception in the bathroom I hear
[0:16:32] <OkamiDude15> CCC translation never. start learning japanses
[0:16:34] <+tearknack> 3.0 or 3.1?
[0:16:34] <$BallerSwagBro9k> L
[0:16:36] <+krispen_wa> just read the translated gil route and just imagine the true route as kiara being horny
[0:16:38] <@Menitta> this isn't your average everyday poverty...this is...ADVANCED POVERTY
[0:16:41] <+ChrisBardow> 3.0?
[0:16:43] <%0rond> CCC translation is ACTUALLY being worked on
[0:16:44] <+captain_history> I really like how well animated MB sprites are
[0:16:46] <%TimetodiveLTX> it's not a DOS prompt per se but the mouse won't help you
[0:16:47] <saiyan24675> @ballerswagbro9k to tell you the truth man CCC isn’t getting a translation cause the Psp sucks
[0:16:55] <%Irridium> so far poverty bordering on favela
[0:17:01] <%FuqBoiSlim> When you think about it. the whole world is just one big bathroom, so you can play melty anywhere
[0:17:02] <Kristoffers> can we just watch 2008 Melty Blood Combo MADs on youtube
[0:17:02] <%0rond> also main route is translated on youtube
[0:17:06] <strayed42> Also because the CCC translators are incompetent but that's another matter
[0:17:07] <%Wool> true Poverty
[0:17:08] <yulixup> f wara
[0:17:08] <Broand> it only works in areas of low internet traffic like a bathroom/car park/hallway
[0:17:09] <@Menitta> this is 100% unemployment rate poverty
[0:17:12] <%TimetodiveLTX> woolie you're a gem thank you for figuring it out
[0:17:22] <1matheuw> wow sounds like a pain
[0:17:25] <%Thunderhog> Woolie figures it out
[0:17:27] <%TimetodiveLTX> i'm sorry i didn't remember the struggle
[0:17:29] <crimsonsaens> It's also on Steam, but doesn't have rollback
[0:17:34] <+krispen_wa> what about that JPN-French-English translation of Mahoyo tho
[0:17:35] <phatmac16> Woolie figures it out
[0:17:36] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @saiyan24675 I know

[0:18:15] <crimsonsaens> I can't believe Woolie the liar stole my IP address
[0:18:18] <Mr__Jebus> woolie the liar tho
[0:18:19] <%Irridium> you don't want to play through a VPN. Trust me.
[0:18:22] <$BallerSwagBro9k> I DO IT its fine
[0:18:26] <yulixup> is it dangerous to pass your ip?
[0:18:30] <Incrodon> Mystic Eyes of IP Doxing
[0:18:32] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Cant you just use Parsec on the Steam version?
[0:18:46] <%TimetodiveLTX> @yulixup not really, especially if you host with post 0
[0:18:50] <YakumoYomi> Woolie stole my wifi!...which is good, because DON'T PLAY FIGHTING GAMES ON WIFI
[0:18:51] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Not even Blitzkampf is this complicated
[0:18:51] <+captain_history> Mystic Eyes of N Passes
[0:18:52] <%FuqBoiSlim> steam version doesn't have rollback thi
[0:18:58] <%TimetodiveLTX> because the port is random
[0:19:03] <strayed42> I hope they show off every character and variation
[0:19:07] <eatmcdonalds> 4Head
[0:19:08] <%jiggy_snipe> rollback is the issue
[0:19:10] <strayed42> six hour melty stream let's go
[0:19:11] <Agami23> know who would have been great for meltyblood? asagami fujino
[0:19:12] <%Thunderhog> Yeah and just for clairification, Dont post ip in chat. Should be obvious but still
[0:19:17] <+tearknack> yeah
[0:19:21] <%legacy0117> YOOOO. Melty Blood any good??
[0:19:33] <phatmac16> MB is the best
[0:19:34] <0pirus> don't forget to post your credit card number in chat
[0:19:34] <misterpans> Someone needs to body woolie with Ryougi
[0:19:34] <strayed42> people wouldn't be playing it in 2020 if it wasn't
[0:19:34] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> where should we dm you? @WoolieVersus
[0:19:35] <OkamiDude15> fujino would be cool
[0:19:41] <+CJett92> Melty Blood is the good shit
[0:19:42] <knackirontarkus> Fujino would be dope
[0:19:43] <Fiendmaw> You also want to play on rollback netcode
[0:19:44] <%primax104> have all the bathroom jokes been made?
[0:19:49] <+krispen_wa> @agami23 yknow who would have been great for F/GO with more than 1 attempt to get her? fujinon
[0:19:57] <Fiendmaw> Also the community always encourages buying the Steam version
[0:19:57] <strayed42> unlimited codes is dead and forgotten but melty lives on
[0:20:03] <%FuqBoiSlim> so you're saying we shouldn't post our social security numbers in chat??
[0:20:07] <+CJett92> Oh ya, its been nonstop bathroom jokes for like 20 minutes now
[0:20:08] <0pirus> y'all wanna see my wifi C-Ryougi B)
[0:20:08] <%Solidnick18> understandable
[0:20:09] <Dova573> ill be honest these is alot of hoops for rollback
[0:20:09] <%Thunderhog> Steam version is only good if you want to play the arcade translated and supporting the offical release. Other than that, play the comunity version
[0:20:19] <%Solidnick18> yeah
[0:20:20] <@Menitta> You can get a whisper
[0:20:22] <MayorRev> whispers yeah
[0:20:24] <YakumoYomi> @primax104 There can never be enough bathroom jokes when it comes to Melty Blood.

[0:20:25] <@Solidus_113> you can use /w

[0:27:02] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> The melty community likes the memes too
[0:27:04] <+GuelermeDias> @WoolieVersus It's the MELTY BLOOD EVERYWHERE SYSTEM
[0:27:08] <@Menitta> Woolie doesn't like it because that means the signup line is comparable to a bathroom
[0:27:09] <%CozyGUNNA> oh yeah MB bathroom is a thing
[0:27:09] <%Thunderhog> Yall haven't seen shit till you seen people playing melty blood in the mountains
[0:27:18] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Now I know how Melee players feel

[0:27:41] <%legacy0117> Ask the guys, I think that was a non-permanent thing.
[0:27:42] <%Thunderhog> Also real talk, without melty we probably wouldn't have team spooky. real facts
[0:27:47] <+CJett92> Get some new lore, folks

[0:28:14] <%legacy0117> Rather not drop it in chat if they want to keep it off record.
[0:28:14] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> haha comedy

[0:32:17] <%Nekros4442> @Diana869 It is, but it's fun nonsense
[0:32:17] <knackirontarkus> the problem with getting into Fate is that if you’re not into reading VNs you’re basically stuck in a difficult place

[0:34:14] <%alephalpha> I need to et into it
[0:34:24] <+maenos2> @knackirontarkus honestly either way you watch you're kinda spoiled to some twists.
[0:34:25] <%0rond> stay night spoils zero*
[0:34:28] <wohdin> @l_a_s_e_r_m_a_n it’s just the new rickroll shitpost on twitter
[0:34:32] <MakotoFox> 25 raiders from MakotoFox have joined! 
[0:34:32] <+attackofthesage> I think if you HAVE to watch Fate rather than read the VN, you might as well follow ufotable's order
[0:34:33] <%legacy0117> Thankfully I keep my stuff clean from all that. >,<
[0:34:37] <%alephalpha> Can't escape the NASUVERSE FOREVER
[0:34:39] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Oh ok thanks
[0:34:39] <%AlteisenReiseZ> OH SNAP FOX
[0:34:40] <+attackofthesage> I would really recommend the VN though
[0:34:42] <0pirus> no you aren't
[0:34:43] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> Zero came out later so you should read it later, read the friggin VN first
[0:34:44] <%Nekros4442> LETS GO ROA
[0:34:45] <+CJett92> @knackirontarkus I totally agree, but without a good Fate route adaptation and without the VN, I still think it's the best anime-only starting point for now
[0:34:45] <ADA_SIX> what's uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuup
[0:34:46] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> it's not that hard
[0:34:47] <Fiendmaw> makoto5Strap makoto5Gucci makoto5Gucci makoto5Strap
[0:34:48] <%alephalpha> OH NO HE PLAYS C ROA THAT CHARACTE RIS A WARCRIME
[0:34:49] <%0rond> just make a good fate route anime and everythign will be solved.
[0:34:51] <+eanscrale> Lookin forward to them C Roa matches

[0:34:54] <%phatmac16> ROA THE GOD
[0:34:56] <+Chronoreyer> hahHAHAHA
[0:34:57] <strayed42> Zero is a prequel though With prequels you can always know how they end Zero spoils legitimate plot twists, not "will this character die"?
[0:34:59] <CalderGaming> For Fun
[0:35:03] <%alephalpha> C ROA IS AN ACTUAL WARCRIME
[0:35:09] <Shardlab> Yeah.... new folks need an in to Fate that isn't a VN
[0:35:09] <%Solidnick18> woolieFUN
[0:35:13] <%Broand> H-KOHAKU tho
[0:35:13] <hassanico2> Chat bets on how hard they'll fuck up nrvnsqr's name
[0:35:16] <chuunigarbage> Roa ain't even top 3 lmao
[0:35:23] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Hey whats up with Melty Blood character names?
[0:35:25] <ADA_SIX> 3 rollback is good utnil about 45ms
[0:35:25] <+Chronoreyer> time to close tekken and roll the dice
[0:35:25] <Fiendmaw> Just go 0 delay 4 rollback and you're golden
[0:35:26] <Samosiv> what are you trying to set up, I'm a melty player
[0:35:28] <lem______> C roa is top 3 tho.....
[0:35:31] <TopTierHarley> playing with Makoto?
[0:35:33] <hassanico2> @L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N aliens
[0:35:34] <ADA_SIX> then add 4 rollback
[0:35:35] <NotDamare> lmao
[0:35:36] <+genowyn> Does woolie know what the moon phases mean now
[0:35:36] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:35:37] <%DreyfussFrost> Man... last time I used it was in college in like 2008...
[0:35:37] <%phatmac16> I think Woolie knows his name is Nero Chaos
[0:35:38] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> I got into fate through unlimited codes, after that i watched the deen anime and then read the VN
[0:35:40] <chuunigarbage> C-Roa's worse than Kohaku, he's worse than Arc, he's worse than Hime
[0:35:41] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Oh I see
[0:35:41] <Fiendmaw> Assuming ping is less than 60ms 0 delay 4 rollback is fine
[0:35:44] <+attackofthesage> @0rond We're gonna get a hollow ataraxia adaptation before fate route
[0:35:49] <knackirontarkus> @cjett92 true
[0:35:50] <+Zoggere> General rule i like to use: go up to 3 rollback and then 2 delay if its above that @woolieversus anything above that is a little laggy
[0:35:51] <+Rhythmaxed> did melty blood ever get rollback netcode hacked into it?
[0:35:51] <Vashido22> Riesbyfe gang rise up
[0:35:52] <%Broand> neco chaos
[0:35:52] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> The VN is essential for the full course, you can't avoid that
[0:35:54] <Samosiv> no one is going to play C-Roa in a day
[0:35:54] <%Nekros4442> Isnt Top 3 like...C-Roa, Kohaku and Akiha or something? Hime is there too somewhere
[0:35:57] <Namillus> Kohaku? Is there a Bionicle in this?
[0:35:59] <%alephalpha> @chuunigarbage That's a debatable but valid opinion
[0:35:59] <Fiendmaw> Are you guys not playing each other?
[0:35:59] <ADA_SIX> i never add delay
[0:36:00] <%0rond> the biggest issue is that there's an anime about UBW, and movies in the making about heaven's feel but no fate route anime so you have to start from the VN
[0:36:03] <%KosOrSomeSayKosm_> training, for GLORY
[0:36:03] <ADA_SIX> but that's just bc i play c-sion
[0:36:05] <%CozyGUNNA> @namillus yes
[0:36:05] <ADA_SIX> lmao
[0:36:05] <Shardlab> I know all of ya'll haven't read Spider-man since the 90's so I'm not gonna tell you to read the three or four concurrent books that were going on until the mid-90's to get into that story
[0:36:07] <knackirontarkus> but the VN is still the best way to get in
[0:36:12] <%TimetodiveLTX> DW woolie, as long as rollback exceeds the delay specified after a player connects, youll b efine
[0:36:13] <%Thunderhog> i'll proably be dropping mini guides as it goes
[0:36:13] <chuunigarbage> Hime's the best character in the game
[0:36:13] <%Kazuhira_Boat> Where da R. Shiki gang at?
[0:36:20] <illtima> illtima subscribed at Tier 1.

[0:36:58] <+attackofthesage> @Shardlab sure, but you end up missing a third of the story. Saber's route was never adapted into a good anime

[0:37:04] <Vashido22> F-RIES HYPE
[0:37:05] <strayed42> You can't complain about Fate not having an easy entry point and then ignore the VN despite that being the easiest @Shardlab
[0:37:07] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> Woolie seems like a Kouma kind of dude
[0:37:08] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Yeah, woolie would play Kouma
[0:37:08] <fernandapsdois> wheres the get into fighting games layout
[0:37:09] <hassanico2> NekoArc Hype Kappa
[0:37:10] <Fiendmaw> Volume is fine
[0:37:10] <%phatmac16> ISN'T IT SAD SACCHIN?
[0:37:11] <%Broand> isn't it sad saccin

[0:37:16] <yulixup> unist guest char Kappa
[0:37:17] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> isn't it sad sacchin?
[0:37:19] <Agami23> god i would love a modern remake or sequel by the undernight devs
[0:37:20] <PyrokidSosa> Might have to sample this ost :O
[0:37:20] <%0rond> but the VN isn't an easy entry point, it's around 90 hours long
[0:37:20] <%Reverend_Roscoe> it's fine
[0:37:25] <%Nekros4442> @strayed42 The VN is definitely not the easiest. The anime or something is easier
[0:37:26] <Arek_1> Is there an option for integer scale?
[0:37:27] <%phatmac16> SUGOI SUGOI
[0:37:28] <kaine_west> we playing Shiki boys?
[0:37:29] <%alephalpha> someon better main neko arc and mech
[0:37:29] <%Thunderhog> So here's the real question. Does woolie understand how Moons work
[0:37:30] <knackirontarkus> bring Satsuki is suffering
[0:37:31] <Shardlab> I'll lay that lack of storytelling on the creators
[0:37:35] <ADA_SIX> press f4
[0:37:37] <ADA_SIX> yeah
[0:37:38] <knackirontarkus> *being
[0:37:38] <ADA_SIX> yeah!!!
[0:37:41] <%phatmac16> PRESS F4
[0:37:42] <%alephalpha> @thunderhog he didn't during fisticuffs
[0:37:42] <%0rond> moons are basicaally mortal kombat styles
[0:37:44] <Fiendmaw> Woolie didnt understand moons back on fisticuffs
[0:37:44] <%Broand> So's persona @Orond
[0:37:45] <hassanico2> They played this on Super Best Friends... 5 years ago?
[0:37:47] <%legacy0117> And this aesthetic already looks great. :)
[0:37:48] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> hoh boy
[0:37:49] <misterpans> RYOUGI IS NOT BORING
[0:37:50] <%Solidnick18> haven't seen this in a long ass time
[0:37:50] <Shardlab> You work to adapt that depth and I'll watch it
[0:37:54] <%alephalpha> RYOUGI IS RAD
[0:37:56] <%Nekros4442> Moons are straight up MK Variations
[0:37:57] <+lucaflowe> Why are they sitting on a couch and not in the bathroom?
[0:37:58] <%KosOrSomeSayKosm_> setting up this game is a bit of a pain

[0:48:45] <hassanico2> Are the sides reversed?
[0:48:45] <CrmznOgre> Why no bathroom stream?
[0:48:51] <%alephalpha> the only moon that matters is full cause the only character that matters is hime
[0:48:52] <ADA_SIX> bc bathroom jokes aren't funn
[0:48:53] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> This game is beautiful
[0:48:55] <%SuperKirby24> Animation Kreygasm
[0:48:58] <+CJett92> unnnnnnffff thats the good stuff
[0:48:58] <eatmcdonalds> Arcueid shows in fate extra too
[0:48:59] <%FuqBoiSlim> @crmznogre 😐
[0:49:00] <hassanico2> Jesus this animation
[0:49:02] <%phatmac16> BEAUTIFUL FRAMES
[0:49:03] <%0rond> the way all the cloth flaps
[0:49:04] <$SilverRoddo> woolieFUN
[0:49:04] <+TopTieramisu> smooth shit Kreygasm
[0:49:04] <YakumoYomi> Isn't Neko-Arc the second strongest Nasuverse character?
[0:49:07] <%0rond> amazing
[0:49:09] <%legacy0117> The Japanese language can be very long winded compared to other languages. x.x
[0:49:11] <chuunigarbage> @DreyfussFrost you're right but like, in general the way to think about it is "combo heavy", "aggressive", "neutral heavy"
[0:49:15] <+eanscrale> The developers were inspired by the animation in Third Strike if I recall
[0:49:22] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> That an unnecessary amount of frames lmao
[0:49:23] <%gunsrlove> woolieGIRLS
[0:49:23] <scoot_io> Don't look down on doujin spirit
[0:49:24] <yulixup> how can Ciel be a tatood nun, isnt the church against that?
[0:49:25] <%0rond> is this by french bread?
[0:49:27] <%doughvatkyn> esp with parries
[0:49:30] <%Diana869> is this where the "rocks baby!" line is from?
[0:49:33] <NotDamare> yeah its french bread
[0:49:33] <%Wool> it's basically Melty
[0:49:33] <GypsyMagi> I can't believe Woolie is into Fate now
[0:49:33] <rasamune> It is
[0:49:35] <DDDorsett> CPS4 Frames Kappa
[0:49:37] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> @0rond yes
[0:49:38] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:49:43] <ADA_SIX> they've been working on these sprites for almost a decade by the time this game came out
[0:49:46] <rasamune> Arcade Bumstead
[0:49:50] <ADA_SIX> plus they're smaller sprites
[0:49:53] <ADA_SIX> compared to newer games
[0:49:54] <%plus_on_black> Dope
[0:49:59] <GypsyMagi> Porkslope Turkeyhandle
[0:50:00] <ADA_SIX> so it's easier to add frames
[0:50:14] <ADA_SIX> f-moon cannot dodge
[0:50:20] <Vashido22> not f moon
[0:50:20] <%Wool> Full Moon has no dodge
[0:50:23] <%Thunderhog> F-moon cant dodge
[0:50:24] <CalderGaming> moon-specific
[0:50:24] <Arek_1> Chat, on a stick, what's the usual control layout? What's on top row, what's on bottom row.
[0:50:38] <%legacy0117> So is she purely a magic fighter, or does she have DARK ARTS weapons?
[0:50:39] <ADA_SIX> yeah dodge is full body invuln but it has recovery
[0:50:47] <MasterIcarus7> A B C on the 1st row, D, empty, E on the second row @Arek_1
[0:50:48] <ADA_SIX> yeah grabs are collision box dependent
[0:51:01] <%phatmac16> Good ass dodge
[0:51:10] <Arek_1> @MasterIcarus7 Thanks.
[0:51:21] <wohdin> manual iframes in ftg lmao
[0:51:23] <MartwyPies> Melty Blood not played in a toilet? What dimension is this
[0:51:29] <%Thunderhog> Yeah this is where Reverse beat gets it's naming
[0:51:33] <ADA_SIX> the dimension with funny jokes
[0:51:45] <lem______> 10 dollars to the pot plz, kthx
[0:51:48] <ADA_SIX> ^
[0:51:48] <%GuelermeDias> SYSTEMS
[0:51:52] <DDDorsett> BLOOD HEAT
[0:51:52] <ADA_SIX> pay our mans
[0:51:53] <Supabait> FEEL THE HEAT
[0:51:55] <chuunigarbage> refill red hp
[0:51:57] <%ChoculaUltra> why does Blood Heat sound so stupid cool
[0:52:01] <1matheuw> holee shiet thats a lot of systems
[0:52:04] <DDDorsett> Aka, UMvC3 X Factor
[0:52:04] <%alephalpha> cause it is
[0:52:04] <chuunigarbage> Also you can use it as a roman cancel
[0:52:15] <%Thunderhog> Heat and blood heat stop time, heals your red health, and gives you access to your "level 3"s
[0:52:16] <+Chronoreyer> f pciel cannot do that
[0:52:16] <$SilverRoddo> What’s that smeeeel?
[0:52:17] <Vashido22> @WoolieVersus remember than moons also change specials and normals
[0:52:19] <+Chronoreyer> she is unique
[0:52:19] <MartwyPies> Remember that guy from Deadman Wonderland who had Blood that would cause combustion
[0:52:20] <Fiendmaw> P Ciel can't airdash
[0:52:31] <+Chronoreyer> she has an airdash, just cant cancel
[0:52:32] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Increased Health Regen. Access to Last Arc and Arc Drive, and Stops the clock
[0:52:32] <+Amaterasu_Nyan> Tsukihime remake never ever.
[0:52:32] <Fiendmaw> Her Air options are limited
[0:52:48] <%0rond> btw Wonderful 101 has been released on steam, if you backed you should have your code
[0:52:49] <%alephalpha> the main advanatge is your frame advanteg on moves is way better nd you gte different moves
[0:52:56] <%phatmac16> parry?
[0:53:10] <GypsyMagi> Just pray for a FGO crossover event with Tsukihime
[0:53:21] <+Zoggere> F characters can hold shield longer and followup with 236d
[0:53:23] <%legacy0117> Very cool. So, Full Moon is full frontal, and the more the Moon wanes you become faster, dodgey, and probably Variablism...As Street Fighter Terminology calls it.
[0:53:25] <%phatmac16> Melty Blood in FGO when?
[0:53:34] <GypsyMagi> Probably never
[0:53:34] <%alephalpha> maybe when thew tuski remake drops
[0:53:36] <%Thunderhog> Shield bunker works as a alpha counter when in guard state as well
[0:53:39] <strayed42> Sion is in the story mode
[0:53:43] <%krispen_wa> They have Sion already
[0:53:46] <Agami23> well. fgo has sion and archtypes in it now so who knows
[0:53:48] <chuunigarbage> @WoolieVersus F Ciel's 63214X is fucking godlike please try it, you can hit it with an ariel to change its tragectory it's so good
[0:53:51] <MasterIcarus7> f-moon is guilty gear, c-moon is melty blood, h-moon is stylish mode
[0:53:51] <+Amaterasu_Nyan> I'd whale for Arc.
[0:53:57] <MartwyPies> Another one of 100s of Tsuki remakes
[0:54:03] <GypsyMagi> Arc was in Extra wasnt she
[0:54:04] <+LandOfTheWay> @phatmac16 we already got sion and ryougi in the game, and dantes' backstory has him kill roa
[0:54:04] <1matheuw> god this terminology is confusing if youre not used to them
[0:54:05] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> It has types not archetypes
[0:54:10] <Fiendmaw> H Moon definitely not stylish mode
[0:54:11] <+CJett92> Neco-Arc Ruler or dont even @ me
[0:54:13] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> those are different
[0:54:16] <%phatmac16> YEYEYE
[0:54:18] <chuunigarbage> arc was in extra, yeah
[0:54:19] <%0rond> requiem collab soon, there is a possibilty of karen servant
[0:54:19] <%legacy0117> Nice.
[0:54:23] <%Thunderhog> Powered is VERY grounded
[0:54:26] <Samosiv> lmao h-moon is not stylish mode for sure
[0:54:26] <%0rond> what
[0:54:28] <DMatts142> Your specials change depending on what moon youre in
[0:54:29] <%phatmac16> SICK
[0:54:31] <%0rond> where was arc in extra?
[0:54:39] <Vashido22> @WoolieVersus you have different specials depending on moon
[0:54:40] <strayed42> secret boss
[0:54:41] <GypsyMagi> As a zerker iirc
[0:54:42] <%krispen_wa> Caren is the only Karen who isn't a Ka*en
[0:54:43] <hassanico2> @0rond optional extra boss
[0:54:43] <%phatmac16> Powerd is more focused than the regular one
[0:54:48] <+CJett92> @0rond secret hidden boss
[0:54:50] <%0rond> the option extra boss was shiki
[0:54:52] <%GuelermeDias> powered is very weird, F-PCiel is even weirder
[0:54:56] <Fiendmaw> @WoolieVersus Hal Circle Back for ROCK
[0:54:58] <%Thunderhog> @WoolieVersus You can turn on unlimited meter in settings if you wanna test supers
[0:55:01] <+LandOfTheWay> @0rond arc was a berserker in that game; one of the enemy servants. ryougi is a secret boss, too
[0:55:02] <+Zoggere> Different moons are different characters honestly
[0:55:03] <strayed42> yeah arc was in CCC wasn't she?
[0:55:06] <+Chronoreyer> rocks are half circle back, hit the rocks with a normal amigo
[0:55:07] <%phatmac16> you need meter
[0:55:08] <%Jetzord> half circle back
[0:55:11] <+Zoggere> Dont treat them like clones
[0:55:11] <%AlteisenReiseZ> A+B+C to charge in full moon
[0:55:13] <PinkSocks> Arcueid is not a secret boss, she's just exclusive to the Rani route.
[0:55:14] <+LandOfTheWay> what's woolie playing this on?
[0:55:14] <%krispen_wa> arc was in normal extra not CCC
[0:55:15] <chuunigarbage> it's such a good move
[0:55:20] <%0rond> oh I thought you meant arc as in neko arc, not actualy arcuied
[0:55:21] <GypsyMagi> Is Ciel's gun the one Mash uses in Olympus?
[0:55:29] <eatmcdonalds> Arcueid not secret, she was beserker in not Rin route
[0:55:32] <+ghostfaceninja_> VIRGIN PAIN doodWAT
[0:55:35] <sendart> mash uses the black barrel
[0:55:36] <Viaquez> "Virgin Pain" move tho
[0:55:36] <%krispen_wa> no, mash's gun was Sions
[0:55:38] <chuunigarbage> it's SUCH a good move
[0:55:39] <Samosiv> hit the rock
[0:55:42] <GypsyMagi> right
[0:55:43] <yulixup> ROCK
[0:55:43] <GypsyMagi> sion's
[0:55:43] <Vashido22> the rock
[0:55:46] <chuunigarbage> hit the rock
[0:55:47] <chuunigarbage> hit it
[0:55:48] <chuunigarbage> please
[0:55:49] <fumatofu> Woolie needs to get into FSN
[0:55:50] <+captain_history> hit the rock
[0:55:51] <%Thunderhog> @WoolieVersus You can hit the rocks to shoot them as a projectile
[0:55:55] <Vashido22> hit the rock
[0:55:56] <Genericname54321> hit the rock
[0:55:56] <TopTierHarley> hit the rock
[0:55:56] <UnluckyGhost> pls hit the rock
[0:55:56] <MasterIcarus7> sion's gun is a replica of the gun mash uses
[0:55:59] <%alephalpha> hit the rock after woolei
[0:56:01] <%phatmac16> Mash uses the Black Barell which is Sion's gun
[0:56:01] <Sapphire_Breeze> hit the rock
[0:56:02] <NotDamare> degen char
[0:56:02] <mrbigslaps> hit the rock
[0:56:03] <Vashido22> @WoolieVersus hit the rock
[0:56:08] <+CJett92> Woolie really doesnt need to get into FSN, he'd hate that shit
[0:56:09] <Axle13j> "virgin pain" and she fights with a pile bunker doodWAT
[0:56:10] <rubbishbinge> @WoolieVersus 空中可 are Air OK moves
[0:56:13] <%phatmac16> HIT THE ROCK
[0:56:14] <%krispen_wa> mash uses the gun of GUN GOD
[0:56:24] <MasterIcarus7> kick the rock
[0:56:25] <+attackofthesage> I can think of a few things from Fate that Woolie would really like
[0:56:26] <%tearknack> with the a version
[0:56:30] <%phatmac16> SICK
[0:56:30] <knackirontarkus> Gun God’s so fucking cool
[0:56:33] <+CJett92> Mashu's new weapon is the BLACK BARREL
[0:56:33] <%tearknack> the a version has a followup
[0:56:36] <+Chronoreyer> @WoolieVersus hit the charge rock with a j.B
[0:56:36] <%phatmac16> GUN GOD IS RAD
[0:56:40] <TopTierHarley> a version
[0:56:40] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1257528186524622851
[0:56:41] <%legacy0117> The rock probably blocks projectiles too.
[0:56:42] <chuunigarbage> hit it with an aerial to lauch it
[0:56:49] <+CJett92> Does Mashu have the N-Pass subscription?
[0:56:51] <%alephalpha> warc is so cool
[0:56:51] <Edjager97> this must be the next episode of getting into fighting games, as this hasn't been played in A WHILE
[0:56:53] <+LandOfTheWay> Gun God and Slash Emperor the real OGs
[0:56:56] <fumatofu> Woolie might like Archer
[0:56:58] <%Nekros4442> You have like 0 air mobility
[0:56:59] <Vashido22> man this game is so cool
[0:57:02] <%0rond> I can't believe black barrel is canon
[0:57:05] <Psykoknight65> when will I get my hype fate fighting game Arcsys?
[0:57:06] <%ZombiLoin> does archer have an n-word pass
[0:57:08] <%phatmac16> YOU GOT A TON OF JUMPS
[0:57:10] <%0rond> it opens up so many possibilites
[0:57:12] <+Amaterasu_Nyan> Ciel is so fucking cute.
[0:57:16] <+attackofthesage> I think he would appreciate how much of a bro Lancer is
[0:57:22] <JGwent> I would kill for Nasu to do anything with Notes
[0:57:23] <GypsyMagi> When are we getting a Fate game that doesn't blow gameplaywise
[0:57:24] <+LandOfTheWay> @Psykoknight65 there's actually an old stay night 3d fighter that's not bad
[0:57:32] <Samosiv> FUC
[0:57:34] <Vashido22> @WoolieVersus you should check other moons later since the change the movelists too
[0:57:36] <%0rond> yo FGO's gameplay is actually good though
[0:57:36] <crimsonsaens> I'm disappointed neither is trying to learn Roast Beef Streudelburger
[0:57:37] <+LandOfTheWay> busted as hell, but fun
[0:57:38] <MasterIcarus7> i fuck with fuc
[0:57:40] <+devilishleader> ya unlimited codes
[0:57:41] <Axle13j> F/UC remaster lul
[0:57:44] <+KageSenpaiLP> The universe demands balance, Fate makes the money, Melty plays like honey
[0:57:44] <+CJett92> @JGwent It's heavily hinted at that Type Mercury is gonna be in Lostbelt 7
[0:57:51] <GypsyMagi> Yes
[0:57:51] <+Zoggere> The blood circles are super annoying lol
[0:57:54] <chuunigarbage> i just want UC HD ;-;
[0:58:00] <GypsyMagi> Daybit is doing something with ORT
[0:58:06] <quietshun> I love fgo gameplay
[0:58:08] <yulixup> there is also a fangame called Curtis fatal fake or something
[0:58:09] <%0rond> the command card system is actually cool and i'm surprised not more games ripped it off
[0:58:10] <%GuelermeDias> PLUTO DIE SCHWESTER
[0:58:10] <%phatmac16> yup
[0:58:19] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> You need meter for blood heat
[0:58:20] <%Thunderhog> If anyone gets a Ryougi last arc tongiht im gonna flip
[0:58:25] <GypsyMagi> I can't believe they're bringing ORT back
[0:58:27] <%GuelermeDias> IMPEACHMENT OF ORIGINAL SIN
[0:58:29] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Parry an attack in Blood Heat
[0:58:30] <%phatmac16> SEVEN
[0:58:34] <%legacy0117> Definitely magic type.
[0:58:35] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @chuunigarbage
[0:58:37] <Shardlab> Cygames hired Arksys to make their game, why can't Fate go there too?
[0:58:38] <+7oasty> @thunderhog I'd noot.
[0:58:40] <%phatmac16> SIANT'S BURIAL
[0:58:41] <%0rond> they brought back primal murder ORT is absoultely in the realm of possibilty
[0:58:44] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> @WoolieVersus Parry the attack for the last one
[0:58:46] <mrbigslaps> Different Moons have different move lists, frame data, and buttons so consider them different characters basically
[0:58:49] <+PlushMines> I was scrolling by and when I saw Melty Blood on the docket I sprinted in to get me some good tertiary Fate content
[0:58:50] <+Zoggere> Last arc is a frame perfect parry in blood heat
[0:58:53] <%legacy0117> Or rather, blood magic, still.
[0:58:56] <%phatmac16> YEYEYE
[0:58:56] <+Zoggere> 3 frame window
[0:59:05] <GypsyMagi> Well didn't they recently found their own game studio? BB something?
[0:59:08] <%Thunderhog> @WoolieVersus Last arcs are when you parry a move in blood heat. They literally steal souls
[0:59:10] <brothernerofgc> should i get this game?
[0:59:11] <%KosOrSomeSayKosm_> this game has some pretty smooth animation yo
[0:59:17] <%0rond> they did, it's working on stuff but we don't know shit
[0:59:22] <JGwent> @CJett92 I lost my FGO account
[0:59:25] <Agami23> its fucking mewtwos side B
[0:59:33] <%krispen_wa> Studio BB
[0:59:34] <%0rond> nasu fucking loves the extraverse though so expect more of that
[0:59:35] <GypsyMagi> And they announced that Emiya Gohan game for the switch too
[0:59:39] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Last Arcs are Just frame parries in blood heat. They do well over 50%
[0:59:40] <%Thunderhog> @brothernerofgc You can get the offical release, but the version everyone plays is a free comunity version with rollback net code.
[0:59:42] <%krispen_wa> a subsidiary of BB CHANNERU~
[0:59:44] <%KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @brothernerofgc it's literally free, just google melty blood community version, so you got nothing to lose
[0:59:44] <%phatmac16> YEYEYEYE
[0:59:46] <%Nekros4442> Emiya Gohan is so comfy
[0:59:53] <Vashido22> man ciel is fucking rad
[0:59:53] <CalderGaming> ^
[0:59:54] <+jetjagger222> !uptime
[0:59:55] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 59 minutes and 56 seconds
[0:59:55] <%phatmac16> Emiya Gohan is real comfy
[0:59:57] <MayorRev> did she just fuckin OHOHOHOHO
[0:59:57] <MasterIcarus7> aoko's LA only does 5K smh
[0:59:57] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> To use the last special parry while in blood heat @WoolieVersus
[0:59:58] <%0rond> emiya gohan is great
[0:59:58] <%legacy0117> COUNTER.
[1:00:00] <%Thunderhog> @brothernerofgc Feel free to support the game offically, but do download the free game and see what you like
[1:00:01] <chuunigarbage> just frame parry
[1:00:03] <%legacy0117> Oh.
[1:00:03] <%DreyfussFrost> @WoolieVersus Parry during Blood Heat
[1:00:12] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Just Frame Parry
[1:00:17] <%jiggy_snipe> Ciel has one of my favorite designs
[1:00:21] <SableS139a> Yeah, Type Moon is still working on the Tsukihime remake (fucking surprisingly), but Fate's always at the forefront considering how well Grand Order's done so far.
[1:00:30] <SableS139a> >feelsbadman
[1:00:30] <GypsyMagi> Ciel kinda looks like grownup Jack with this color
[1:00:34] <+captain_history> it has to be a just frame parry
[1:00:34] <%Thunderhog> You have to just frame parry
[1:00:35] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> Needs to be frame perfect
[1:00:36] <%DreyfussFrost> Has to be a perfect parry
[1:00:41] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Perfect Parry
[1:00:42] <%phatmac16> NEEDS TO BE PERFECT
[1:00:42] <DrBeanie> oof
[1:00:44] <Vashido22> frame perfect
[1:00:45] <Fiendmaw> Woolie you can set Meter to UNLIMITED
[1:00:47] <crimsonsaens> Some need to be crouching or in the air
[1:00:50] <hassanico2> 3 frames opportunity
[1:00:51] <Vashido22> There you go
[1:00:54] <%krispen_wa> HERE WE GO
[1:00:55] <chuunigarbage> yeeeeeeee
[1:00:55] <+Zoggere> 3 frame window
[1:00:56] <%phatmac16> GOD
[1:00:59] <%phatmac16> YEYEYEYE
[1:01:00] <%Thunderhog> SOUL TAKEN TO GOD
[1:01:03] <SableS139a> THERE YOU GO
[1:01:05] <Shardlab> aiight
[1:01:05] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> EXORCISM RITE
[1:01:12] <%GuelermeDias> that's the hard read styling on 'em
[1:01:12] <%phatmac16> EXORCISM
[1:01:15] <Vashido22> EXORCISM
[1:01:17] <%0rond> I would expect a tsukihime announcement for the 20 years anniversary, so if we don't hear anything by february I would lose hope
[1:01:17] <UnluckyGhost> You can set unlimited meter in the battle settings
[1:01:19] <@Solidus_113> okay, I'm practiced up and ready for online
[1:01:25] <%Thunderhog> @WoolieVersus You can set unlimited meter in setings
[1:01:26] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> Only full moon can charge
[1:01:26] <chuunigarbage> Ryougi's does like 60% lmao
[1:01:27] <@Menitta> Solidus is very much ready.
[1:01:30] <crimsonsaens> Charging is a full moon thing
[1:01:31] <%DreyfussFrost> Only full moon can charge.
[1:01:39] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Charging is only in Full Moon
[1:01:39] <@Menitta> I got bopped
[1:01:42] <%legacy0117> Dang half health bar.
[1:01:44] <MasterIcarus7> battle setting
[1:01:45] <SableS139a> Last Arcs are tricky to perform correctly, so you won't use them often. When you do, however, it's often worth it.
[1:01:46] <%phatmac16> Battle settings
[1:01:46] <chuunigarbage> you can set meter in battle settings @WoolieVersus
[1:01:50] <%phatmac16> BATTLE SETTINGS
[1:01:53] <%krispen_wa> UNLIMITED
[1:01:54] <@Solidus_113> Warcrime rushdown and traps
[1:01:58] <sendart> BLADE
[1:02:02] <+Chronoreyer> solidus do you want to play a ft3 while they get acclimated to the systems
[1:02:11] <SableS139a> Warcueid Warcrimes
[1:02:13] <+Hilleltaco> Normal guard, not the counter
[1:02:14] <MasterIcarus7> some of them are air only
[1:02:16] <BoogieDeluxe> oh shit we finally learnin Melty helllll yeah
[1:02:17] <chuunigarbage> you're doing shield bunker =o
[1:02:19] <Fiendmaw> Just do the D button not bunker
[1:02:20] <+genowyn> Just parry not shield bunker
[1:02:20] <NotDamare> its just d no input
[1:02:20] <@Solidus_113> sure
[1:02:21] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> Normal parry
[1:02:22] <+LandOfTheWay> wait, are they playing this on pc?
[1:02:23] <+Zoggere> Last arcs still go off if you parry a projectile
[1:02:25] <BoogieDeluxe> always wanted to learn bout this game but i never got to it
[1:02:25] <@Menitta> Oh shit I forgot to plug my laptop into the ethernet
[1:02:30] <@Solidus_113> do you host or me?
[1:02:34] <+Chronoreyer> you can host
[1:02:42] <%0rond> wait woolie is not on arcade stick? why?
[1:02:47] <%jiggy_snipe> they are on community caster edition
[1:02:50] <NotDamare> its a tap
[1:02:51] <%krispen_wa> that was lame
[1:02:56] <%phatmac16> just a tap
[1:03:02] <%DreyfussFrost> @WoolieVersus The moons do a lot more than just change meter mechanics. A lot of characters have different normals and specials in different moons. They're almost like MKX variations. You should try all of them.
[1:03:04] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> Wallachia's is the best btw
[1:03:05] <Fiendmaw> Some Last Arcs are cooler than others
[1:03:06] <%krispen_wa> the laugh is good tho
[1:03:09] <GypsyMagi> KATTO
[1:03:13] <hassanico2> I assume palette swap characters have lamer looking ones
[1:03:15] <SableS139a> @ANGRA_MAlNYU This man right here knows
[1:03:17] <chuunigarbage> That's true of every mood
[1:03:18] <chuunigarbage> moon
[1:03:21] <%Thunderhog> Also you didnt exactly go into moon specifics
[1:03:24] <%krispen_wa> NO MAIN MENU
[1:03:24] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Chat, coolest Last Arc?
[1:03:26] <Fiendmaw> No main menu in Caster
[1:03:27] <MayorRev> Melty blood has no main menu?
[1:03:30] <%krispen_wa> Aoko's
[1:03:31] <%Wool> you can also Melty itself for a main menu
[1:03:31] <+LandOfTheWay> warc's arc drive is honestly better than her last arc
[1:03:32] <hassanico2> Wait was training its own application?
[1:03:34] <%Solidnick18> oh god
[1:03:36] <%0rond> why is woolie not on using arcade stick @WoolieVersus
[1:03:36] <DrFuzzyPanda> Just tuned in, the sprite work is amazing!
[1:03:36] <Fiendmaw> They're using caster to access training mode
[1:03:37] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> LATE STAGE POVERTY
[1:03:37] <Vashido22> No main menu on caster
[1:03:39] <%KosOrSomeSayKosm_> don't you wanna show us your ip wolie?
[1:03:40] <%phatmac16> just in Caster
[1:03:41] <UnluckyGhost> Return to character select still works
[1:03:41] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:03:44] <+sirtac4> Yeah the moon's not only change universal system mechanics, but individual character specials and frame data @WoolieVersus
[1:03:47] <%Jetzord> @MayorRev not if you're running it through CC CAster
[1:03:48] <@Solidus_113> this fan version does not
[1:03:48] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @krispen_wa Ohhh yeah, Aoko's is amazing
[1:03:52] <%Thunderhog> @WoolieVersus Half moon gets auto heat at max meter and auto burst on hit if you're in heat
[1:03:54] <%legacy0117> Infinity CHAIN!
[1:03:56] <+LandOfTheWay> also coolest last arc is either ryougi's or archetype's
[1:03:58] <MayorRev> ohh ok
[1:03:58] <%GuelermeDias> @WoolieVersus it auto-bursts and it also has a mini auto combo with 5A6AA
[1:03:58] <SableS139a> And then there's Eclipse which only some characters have. Unless you're using the freeware version of the game or a cheated PS2 version, Eclipse is CPU exclusive.
[1:04:00] <T_Sasquatch> When I was taking my final English college exam 4 years ago , i kept hearing woolie say melty blood throughout my 2 hour exam
[1:04:00] <mrbigslaps> autoburst and limited auto combos
[1:04:01] <knackirontarkus> Ryougi’s is my personal favorite just because I fucking love KNK 5
[1:04:02] <%Wool> Opening the Melty.exe has a main menu
[1:04:04] <%0rond> why is woolie not on his stick?
[1:04:05] <+Zoggere> Half moon has auto burst and auto heat
[1:04:06] <crimsonsaens> Half Moon gets an auto combo, and counter off parries
[1:04:11] <Vashido22> @woolieversus theres moves you haven't seen
[1:04:12] <%DreyfussFrost> Different moons are almost different characters.
[1:04:15] <CalderGaming> actually yes
[1:04:17] <spinbel> Different moon straight up means a different character.
[1:04:20] <MasterIcarus7> there are essentially 87 viable characters
[1:04:20] <%phatmac16> yeah KnK's movies are the best
[1:04:20] <yulixup> H moon cant last arc too
[1:04:21] <%Solidnick18> huh
[1:04:24] <NotDamare> changes normals too alot of the times
[1:04:25] <+Zoggere> Different moons are different characters
[1:04:32] <%laserbeaming> IN HEAT
[1:04:34] <%Thunderhog> Also half moons only have 200 percent meter
[1:04:36] <%DreyfussFrost> Yeah but there's a lot of overlap too.
[1:04:37] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> Scrubmoon
[1:04:37] <TheSaltminer> I think it's a good thing the Melty lore is being deprived from Woolie, trying to explain the Thousand Year Marble Phantasm Millenium Castle Brunestud might break the poor dude
[1:04:39] <+Zoggere> Knowledge barely transfers between moons
[1:04:41] <SableS139a> @knackirontarkus Ryougi's not as busted as she used to be in earlier versions, but she's just fun to play as overall. Feels very good to run.
[1:04:45] <+Zoggere> There’s basically 93 characters
[1:04:46] <%legacy0117> Yeppppp.
[1:04:54] <DedlokPM> The Archer Class is really made up of archers! woolieOMG
[1:04:56] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Some colors are references!
[1:04:56] <%phatmac16> Illya skin!
[1:05:09] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Yknow at one point you get too many choices
[1:05:10] <%DreyfussFrost> But yeah, there's a TON of difference between moons. You should really try all 3.
[1:05:12] <GypsyMagi> Jack skin
[1:05:14] <jubejube56> @TheSaltminer so are they the good guys or the bad guys?
[1:05:15] <%FuqBoiSlim> damn I thought skullgirls had colors
[1:05:20] <SableS139a> @TheSaltminer And yet Tsukihime lore isn't nearly as much of a mess as other JP fighters derived from other works. Ain't that some shit.
[1:05:21] <Spirit_NB> are we sure the stage names aren't Stepmania songs
[1:05:23] <%phatmac16> THIS STAGE IS SICK
[1:05:23] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> Aoko and kid shiki
[1:05:27] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> that's the CG
[1:05:29] <CalderGaming> BIG ANIME MOON
[1:05:32] <%Thunderhog> Also for the uninformed on how different forms mater, Only Full powered ciel gets those Rocks he was messing with.
[1:05:37] <hassanico2> yeyeye doujin mechanics
[1:05:38] <PyrokidSosa> mgs3 background lol
[1:05:39] <+genowyn> Is that Ciel colour a Mash colour
[1:05:40] <%phatmac16> CRIMSON MOON
[1:05:45] <MasterIcarus7> combo into airthrow
[1:05:45] <+captain_history> this stage is great
[1:05:46] <Mr__Jebus> Is that the Type Moon
[1:05:48] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @TheSaltminer
[1:05:49] <SableS139a> @FuqBoiSlim MBAA's got a lot of colors, but a lot of them aren't very good. You'll feel pretty mixed.
[1:05:55] <%phatmac16> DON'T TALK ABOUT THE MOON
[1:05:56] <Namillus> Hey this is the field of Flowers That Kill You from Valkyrie Profile
[1:06:02] <SableS139a> kek
[1:06:03] <%Thunderhog> Kill me snake!
[1:06:06] <%Thunderhog> lytGGS
[1:06:11] <+rytyoung> Fly me to the moooooon
[1:06:11] <%GuelermeDias> you can combo into air throw with all chars @WoolieVersus
[1:06:14] <mrbigslaps> RArc j.B is one of the best buttons in the game to my knowledge
[1:06:15] <Agami23> remember, the moon is a vampire and a super computer
[1:06:16] <GypsyMagi> d'eon just dropped their NP
[1:06:16] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> You face Genichiro Ashina!
[1:06:18] <chuunigarbage> @Mr__Jebus the type moon is an actual thing please do not ask about it
[1:06:19] <+LandOfTheWay> oh yeah, i guess that really is type moon in the background since this is archetype's stage
[1:06:19] <%Solidnick18> yooo
[1:06:22] <%phatmac16> YEYEYE
[1:06:32] <%KosOrSomeSayKosm_> can love bloom on a battlefield?
[1:06:36] <%CaptainPileDriver> so i went to get food
[1:06:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> is reggie just playing an evil mom??
[1:06:48] <crimsonsaens> I forgot about that dumb lightning in the bg
[1:06:56] <SableS139a> @Agami23 Wait, I knew that the moon's a super computer across many of Type Moon's works, but it's apparently also a whole ass vampire?
[1:06:59] <chuunigarbage> yeah, he is
[1:07:04] <Teh_Un> In the original Melty Blood, Normal Ciel and Normal Arcueid's attack had a cross counter animation if their punches clashed three times. I do not know if this carried over into this game
[1:07:05] <T_Sasquatch> Why aren't you playing this in Woolies bathroom ?
[1:07:05] <yulixup> the moon is a cute girl
[1:07:09] <Mr__Jebus> @chuunigarbage too late
[1:07:14] <CalderGaming> THE whole-ass vampire
[1:07:18] <NotDamare> it's not in this version
[1:07:20] <%tearknack> @SableS139a the moon being a computer is later shit iirc
[1:07:22] <+CJett92> @T_Sasquatch Put a quareter in the jar
[1:07:22] <Fiendmaw> The cross counter is not in the game anymore
[1:07:23] <%phatmac16> SICK
[1:07:26] <Agami23> @SableS139a in tsukihime, the moon is a true undead apostle.
[1:07:27] <strayed42> the moon is only a computer in fate/extra
[1:07:30] <%Solidnick18> hmm
[1:07:34] <%legacy0117> Blood magic lady definitely brute force character. x,x So smooth.
[1:07:35] <GypsyMagi> the moon is a computer in extra only
[1:07:36] <Namillus> Specifically a Fate alternate universe, yeah
[1:07:36] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> Behold my friends, the glory of melty blood
[1:07:36] <%0rond> the moon is a computer in extravers
[1:07:36] <lem______> Damn the pot gonna be like over $200 with all these jokes in the chat
[1:07:37] <SableS139a> @Teh_Un Nope. That was exclusive to the first Melty since that was made for fans first and foremost. It was removed starting with ReAct.
[1:07:39] <+LandOfTheWay> @SableS139a the moon is only a super computer in the fate/extra universe
[1:07:42] <%Thunderhog> Woolie's falling in love with short haired pile bunker girl
[1:07:48] <SableS139a> @LandOfTheWay @GypsyMagi Gotcha
[1:07:51] <Teh_Un> @SableS139a Sucks
[1:07:53] <%Thunderhog> It had to be this way
[1:08:01] <%phatmac16> Ciel is badass so that's fine
[1:08:02] <Clyderso> is this the new episode of GET OUT of Fighting Games?
[1:08:09] <MasterIcarus7> the fate/extra universe is implied to have dead apostles, which mean type-moon has to exist in fate/extra
[1:08:09] <+sirtac4> @WoolieVersus Battlefield, Iron Maiden, Back Alley, and Forest of King Cruel have the best stage themes. Caster version might also have ...and nothing heart stage, with the kara no kyokai theme
[1:08:12] <PyrokidSosa> he shmooving
[1:08:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> the evil mommy wins
[1:08:22] <0pirus> no
[1:08:23] <SableS139a> Wait till they play players online. Melty's competitive scene is fucking nuts.
[1:08:24] <GypsyMagi> The original Saberface
[1:08:24] <DDDorsett> Orochi Arc
[1:08:24] <%phatmac16> EDGY
[1:08:25] <%FuqBoiSlim> the bathroom joke jar is gonna be bigger than the dokapon blood pool at this rate
[1:08:33] <+Chronoreyer> @Solidus_113 ggs amigo
[1:08:35] <T_Sasquatch> @cjett92 💷💵💰💸 i don't carry coins
[1:08:36] <Namillus> @Clyderso Surely GET OUT of Fighting Games would involve Woolie sitting there forced to play a game he's bad at against white people?
[1:08:40] <gordieda20> Big evil
[1:08:40] <%DreyfussFrost> @WoolieVersus Try other moons.
[1:08:41] <%phatmac16> Hisui is the original Saber Face
[1:08:44] <crimsonsaens> Reggie knows about Red Arc's super right?
[1:08:48] <@Solidus_113> can you tell i'm a fraud
[1:08:58] <+GaiaGreen> I have no idea what chat is talking about
[1:08:58] <Agami23> if red arcueid is evil ryu. archtype earth is kage
[1:09:02] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> How my blood boils! Face me, Sekiro!
[1:09:04] <%GuelermeDias> oh it's gonna be hilarious when they get matches
[1:09:05] <+captain_history> It's MB the OG sigil fighter?
[1:09:05] <%blastazoid26> Reggie popping off
[1:09:06] <+Chronoreyer> its ok, a lot of people love this game and not very many play it haha
[1:09:06] <SableS139a> @FuqBoiSlim To be fair man, are you REALLY playing Melty if you're not playing on the shitter or in a school cafeteria?
[1:09:07] <chuunigarbage> @DreyfussFrost but all of powerd ciel's other moves are bad
[1:09:09] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> They need to awaken their grab game
[1:09:12] <chuunigarbage> *moons
[1:09:12] <+KageSenpaiLP> At least Shiro got a face in his game... most of the time.
[1:09:16] <+Chronoreyer> ive been playing this game in tournament for like 9 years
[1:09:16] <DDDorsett> Arc Earth is Gill
[1:09:23] <DDDorsett> Lets be real
[1:09:23] <%FuqBoiSlim> @sables139a That's $5 into the jar
[1:09:23] <%legacy0117> The quotes in the background definitely add flair to the victory screen.
[1:09:24] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> and take it to the air
[1:09:25] <chuunigarbage> because they don't have the rock
[1:09:25] <%Broand> woolie in there with the mashu ciel
[1:09:26] <+Chronoreyer> so it is what it is
[1:09:33] <%AlteisenReiseZ> My last melty experience was on a train rofl
[1:09:34] <MasterIcarus7> i'm convinced anybody who still makes melty bathroom jokes is a fetishist
[1:09:36] <@Solidus_113> I want to see those loops on stream, because i'm not getting them
[1:09:37] <strayed42> Type Moon is an eternal reminder that even YOUR chuuni high school scribblings can turn into a multi billion dollar empire
[1:09:40] <Namillus> @Chronoreyer Wow, how many people were in it for it to have gone on this long?
[1:09:40] <GypsyMagi> Is it a Mashu color or a Jack color?
[1:09:40] <SableS139a> @FuqBoiSlim If I had money, I'd probably pay up.
[1:09:44] <+sirtac4> I've played this game off and on since 2003-ish, but actually never entered a tournament
[1:09:52] <+CJett92> White hair, so imma say its a Jack skin
[1:09:53] <SableS139a> @strayed42 VERY much so. >feelsdreamyman
[1:09:58] <+Taglog7> LET ME IN
[1:10:09] <%Solidnick18> PogChamp
[1:10:14] <SableS139a> @GypsyMagi Jack from the looks of it. THe hair isn't lavender enough.
[1:10:17] <+Chronoreyer> @Namillus theres always a couple people at every tournament. Ive never been to a major and not been able to find games, better than I can say for chaos code
[1:10:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> can woolie get something after that super?
[1:10:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> cause it looks like it
[1:10:25] <+CJett92> Not nearly enough eggplant
[1:10:32] <%phatmac16> probably this is Metly after all
[1:10:33] <hassanico2> @CaptainPileDriver she has a down kick
[1:10:34] <+Chronoreyer> it helps that there's just not another game like this
[1:10:38] <+Chronoreyer> one of a kind
[1:10:41] <%phatmac16> you can dash anywhere and do anything
[1:10:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> okay, so he can, just gotta learn it
[1:10:55] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:10:56] <SableS139a> I've always played Melty with friends back in high school during lunch and my free period. Same goes for the Touhou fighters and Vanguard Princess. Really good times...
[1:10:58] <beatie_g> How old is this game?
[1:11:05] <%Thunderhog> @WoolieVersus So just a general combo tip, Magic series is AA B 2B 2C C j.A B J.A B air grab. May vary depending on character but generally works on most of the cast
[1:11:12] <Agami23> canon ending
[1:11:15] <%ZombiLoin> about 8 years old from the latest revision
[1:11:15] <MasterIcarus7> combo into airthrow
[1:11:20] <+sirtac4> @beatie_g this version 2011, the game period 2002
[1:11:22] <%DreyfussFrost> @beatie_g The original Melty Blood came out in 2002
[1:11:35] <SableS139a> @beatie_g Actress Again's been around since 2007.
[1:11:37] <DrBeanie> Kouma

[1:11:38] <%CaptainPileDriver> BIG CAT EYES
[1:11:45] <lem______> fpciel at least
[1:11:45] <%Thunderhog> I did say most of the cast

[1:11:47] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> BA JI QUAN
[1:11:48] <%legacy0117> I like Woolie immediately picking the Big GUN gal. x3
[1:11:51] <%Broand> MIYAKO
[1:11:51] <+ratearth> Has anyone picked Neco yet
[1:11:56] <+Chronoreyer> we call the j.bc j.bc airthrow combos junior bacon cheeseburger combos
[1:11:59] <+CJett92> No, they just started
[1:11:59] <SableS139a> Stupid fucking fun, even if she's mid outside of Full Moon.
[1:11:59] <GypsyMagi> YOROKBE, SHONEN
[1:12:05] <Agami23> mustard child
[1:12:08] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Yeah, Crescent Moon has reverse beat
[1:12:08] <%Thunderhog> Grounded characters like P.ciel and kouma obviously not, but best to get that info out there
[1:12:09] <%GuelermeDias> arima is punch loli
[1:12:10] <+Chronoreyer> will either of them unlock the junior bacon cheeseburger
[1:12:13] <+CJett92> YOROKOBE
[1:12:13] <hassanico2> god imagine if Kirei guested in this
[1:12:13] <mrbigslaps> there are so many Linne colors in this game
[1:12:15] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Someone has to pick Neco once they go online
[1:12:15] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> Poipow
[1:12:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> mustard dragon
[1:12:19] <+radda343> senpai isn'T senpai wiTHouT her glasses...
[1:12:26] <+Amaterasu_Nyan> Black keys PTSD.
[1:12:31] <+TheBesteban> Little loli hit like a dump truck
[1:12:35] <chuunigarbage> her rekka is a projectile it's wild
[1:12:39] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> BLACK KEYS
[1:12:44] <%KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yo that's smooth
[1:12:45] <%Solidnick18> wow
[1:12:46] <+ssulcer> so this is where all those mugen characters come from
[1:12:47] <%Thunderhog> Remember, not knifes. KEYS
[1:12:48] <GypsyMagi> look, it's the teacher from Higurashi
[1:12:48] <%phatmac16> BLACK KEYS HYPE
[1:12:49] <SableS139a> Ciel's your shoto for this game, only with a rekka in place of a tatsu.
[1:12:53] <%KosOrSomeSayKosm_> also black keys, f
[1:12:56] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Oh Reggie, SHE HAS POTEMKIN'S SLIDE HEAD
[1:13:01] <crimsonsaens> Don't forget about her full screen super
[1:13:02] <fat_albert6969> so this is the game Mugen takes half its UI from
[1:13:03] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> Ciel has such crushing pressure
[1:13:03] <SableS139a> @GypsyMagi Shit, you remember that TasoFro game, too?
[1:13:06] <%legacy0117> Punchy types usually hit like trucks.
[1:13:09] <GypsyMagi> Hehe
[1:13:14] <masterfire23> this isn't road to boruto cmonBruh
[1:13:16] <+Chronoreyer> tell reggie to just jump and hit buttons
[1:13:17] <knackirontarkus> big fan of Jouji Nakata being a constant in Type Moon works
[1:13:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> who is the chip character in this game? like, the character that will just chip you out so get fucked
[1:13:22] <+Chronoreyer> miyako air normals are cracked out
[1:13:24] <TopTierHarley> melty players, how the hell do I get my pad to work on this game

[1:17:09] <SableS139a> F-Miyako's one of the few fighters with true infinites in the game, and she has most of them under her belt.
[1:17:11] <%FuqBoiSlim> the grab right out of the super just hurts man NotLikeThis
[1:17:17] <@Solidus_113> I'm gonna have to edit in player names for the YT video

[1:17:45] <+Sikanto> H-Nero, an old patch with Necomech, and Sion (on the necos)
[1:17:45] <%Thunderhog> Also for the record, Melty blood Act Cadenza had a 2V2 mode with 4 players fighting. Maximum Ciel was some bullshit in that jank ass mode
[1:17:49] <+Sikanto> And Vakiha

[1:24:34] <SableS139a> @ratearth Yeah. In comparison to almost everyone else in the game, he outclasses them in height. You think he'd be at least 6'3" though.

[1:27:12] <%CaptainPileDriver> reading the chat and seeing things that i have no fucking clue as to what they mean
[1:27:21] <hassanico2> So is Nero more about the pressure or the punishes?
[1:27:32] <+Sikanto> Well, F nero is very solid in neutral
[1:27:37] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> I assume Nero plays like Gordeau
[1:27:37] <wsintai> @CaptainPileDriver You'd know what they meant if you...Got Into Fighting Games. Eh?
[1:27:38] <%legacy0117> What does Florida have to do with a fighting game?
[1:27:39] <+Sikanto> C nero is more about the pressure in a way
[1:27:54] <DaBigCheat> dp back is a smog that goes different ways depending on input
[1:27:56] <%legacy0117> Whateves.
[1:28:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> i am into fighting games, but each anime game has theyre own terms and this one has some weird ones
[1:28:14] <+Sikanto> @legacy0117 One of NA's strongest is from Florida
[1:28:17] <yulixup> Nero is about using summons, getting hit but then the summons saves him and gives him a combo
[1:28:20] <hassanico2> @CaptainPileDriver Moons are character styles

[1:36:51] <@Menitta> Is this Unlimited Blade Works
[1:36:51] <%AlteisenReiseZ> A Neco Arc is Fine too
[1:36:52] <$arcielardor> I didn't know Fate had a tiny cat woman
[1:36:57] <strayed42> Shiki is fucking crazy, the boy looks bland but he can be a real psycho
[1:36:59] <Greenjim> necomech can hold her 5c down to dash forwards with the chainsaw
[1:37:00] <SableS139a> @Sikanto The only instances that they are are semi-official print works and Carnival Phantasm. That's pretty much it.
[1:37:01] <%GuelermeDias> the only hard r in this game is C-Roa
[1:37:07] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:37:10] <+Sikanto> @SableS139a I'm aware don't worry
[1:37:16] <+CJett92> Tohno Shiki is mehh, Ryougi Shiki is GOAT
[1:37:19] <+Sikanto> I've read all that side of TM material
[1:37:21] <Raldavar> What's Tsukihime? I thought the Nasuverse is only fate and that landlady I owe rent to
[1:37:25] <hassanico2> Keeping track of NecoArc in this seems rough
[1:37:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> FINALLY
[1:37:31] <+Sikanto> @Raldavar One of Nasu's first works
[1:37:32] <MayorRev> LASER EYES
[1:37:33] <hassanico2> NICE
[1:37:34] <+Sikanto> It's about Vampires

[1:37:39] <+Amaterasu_Nyan> Can Shiki kill servants?
[1:37:40] <Greenjim> arial slash is nanaya
[1:37:40] <DedlokPM> mogsLOUD NECO BEAAAAAAM
[1:37:47] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Tier list in cool goes Ryougi > Nanaya > The grand canyon > Tohno
[1:37:49] <Raldavar> @sikanto I wasn't being serious
[1:37:50] <%phatmac16> NANANYA NOT THIS SHIKI
[1:37:50] <Greenjim> you're thinking of c-nanaya, woolie
[1:37:51] <%GuelermeDias> you should try nanaya, yeah
[1:37:51] <0pirus> woolie there are like 6 shikis
[1:37:56] <eldragon_1> So does he have the same mystic eyes as Ryougi Shiki?
[1:38:00] <$TIME_PUNCHER> NICO NICO BEAM
[1:38:07] <SableS139a> @Raldavar Nope. There's a lot more to the Nasuverse, but Fate overshadows everything b/c Grand Order rakes in serious dough. Everything not Fate-related's more or less fallen to the wayside.
[1:38:08] <@Menitta> Are any of the Shiki's less generic
[1:38:08] <+captain_history> That move was C Nanaya yeah
[1:38:09] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> Tohno came first
[1:38:09] <strayed42> The answer to "can Shiki kill servants" is "depending, yes, but his head would explode"
[1:38:10] <%Nekros4442> @eldragon_1 Weaker but yes
[1:38:16] <%legacy0117> Sneaky.

[1:39:44] <strayed42> stream quality went down. it really feels like early 2000s now
[1:39:45] <+Sikanto> @Shinobi2612 Let me do this one
[1:39:45] <%phatmac16> THE GOD
[1:39:46] <%GuelermeDias> play F-Aoko @SableS139a

[1:39:59] <+Shinobi2612> i'm at work right now so you have no choice
[1:40:00] <Greenjim> the top tier roa is crescent
[1:40:02] <Allrthur> Michael is MUGEN Joel and i will not accept anything else
[1:40:03] <@Solidus_113> Roa in C-Moon is a war crime
[1:40:04] <+TempXa> Riesbyfe has the coolest design in this game.
[1:40:05] <+Chronoreyer> theres a lot of work they're gonna be handed
[1:40:06] <+TempXa> No cap.
[1:40:06] <+Sikanto> You're wish is my command
[1:40:08] <Greenjim> h-roa is strong, but c-roa is so much stronger
[1:40:12] <SableS139a> @GuelermeDias That IS an option... Thanks my guy
[1:40:14] <+Chronoreyer> dont worry
[1:40:20] <SableS139a> Also SourPls
[1:40:23] <@Solidus_113> Chrono is real, trust him
[1:40:23] <knackirontarkus> C-Roa sure is something
[1:40:24] <%AlteisenReiseZ> C-Roa is a violation of the geneva convention
[1:40:25] <Greenjim> you can jump cancel h-roa's 6c when it's blocked
[1:40:34] <%GuelermeDias> H-Roa is good, C-Roa is broken but hard, F-Roa is bad but super easy
[1:40:35] <Narcowski> I probably could but Sikanto will do a better job

[1:42:40] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Sikanto can you use neco though? cause i'd like to see woolie suffer
[1:42:41] <Greenjim> or 5c 2c 6c
[1:42:43] <strayed42> Just don't worry about the lore, let it flow through you
[1:42:46] <+Shinobi2612> wow climax shouted woolie out
[1:42:48] <+Sikanto> I don't play fake characters
[1:42:48] <Greenjim> most air combos are j.bc j.bc AT

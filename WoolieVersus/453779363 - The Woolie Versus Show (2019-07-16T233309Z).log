[0:26:29] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[0:26:30] <EySoyCoco> isnt that the dude from durarara?
[0:26:31] <NinjaTB> It's happening. Finally, my game is getting some spot light!
[0:26:35] <OldManDeckardCain> SAO literally only had 1 good volume LUL
[0:26:40] <@Menitta> Asuna is actually pretty fun in this game
[0:26:51] <%Solidnick18> welp
[0:26:54] <gustavozxd> I clicked a random episode of SAO and it was Kirito's sister talking about wanting to fuck him, seconds later Asuna is getting attacked by tentacles
[0:26:57] <haveswordmuststing> @oldmandeckardcain it had... a strong first episode
[0:27:00] <ike_shamus> We here Woolie
[0:27:03] <gordieda20> F
[0:27:17] <NinjaTB> Pretty sure It's in english on ps3, for anyone who cares
[0:27:23] <Fujiwara_92> Sao ends at the first season and even so it's just ok
[0:27:28] <%CaptainPileDriver> ope
[0:27:30] <@Menitta> its on PS3. Ignition never came out here
[0:27:30] <FalcoLambda> there's an english mod for vita and i think ps3, yeah
[0:27:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> *nope
[0:27:33] <%gatorafan> I'm sure the stream's Japanese audience will join. Kappa
[0:27:36] <ike_shamus> you will get a lobby. you wont win, but we will fill a lobby
[0:27:37] <+Austinck> Trash it, trash SAO
[0:27:37] <@Menitta> oh yeah vita too
[0:27:37] <tigerfang86> anybody want to Fighting Climax with woolie Kreygasm
[0:27:41] <FalcoLambda> nowhere near finished mod btw
[0:27:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> yeah, this game is on ps3 and vita but not ps4 for the west
[0:27:46] <tigerfang86> I wish I could climax with woolie
[0:27:51] <poutinedreamteam> I have the English PSV version
[0:27:52] <ManOfReason> wait it came out on ps3 in 2015?!?!
[0:27:55] <Pnutz409> Is this headlining at Evo?
[0:28:04] <poppy_marth> maybe in the bathroom
[0:28:11] <haveswordmuststing> @manofreason Just Dance is still releaskng on the Wii
[0:28:17] <FalcoLambda> the original version is in the west, ignition is a sequel update
[0:28:24] <gustavozxd> @pnutz409 oh yeah it's gonna take sfv's place
[0:28:33] <NinjaTB> yea this game came out like 2 months before guilty gear xrd, not sure when ignition came out, but it was well after
[0:28:37] <ManOfReason> thats just crazy
[0:28:42] <+mcjimbles> As someone not up to date on podcasts, has woolie mentioned how many episodes of hxh he watched or is he keeping that secret?
[0:29:00] <FalcoLambda> english version of DFC dropped in october 2015. ignition's release date? december 2015.
[0:29:06] <gustavozxd> I might hate nearly every single character in this game but I'm a sucker for anime fighters regardless
[0:29:20] <jonathandemel> @mcjimbles Secret I think
[0:29:28] <haveswordmuststing> isnt there a Virtua Fighter in here
[0:29:33] <FalcoLambda> akira and pai
[0:29:43] <+mcjimbles> @jonathandemel ok cool, just wondering
[0:29:43] <gustavozxd> Akira playable, Pai is assist
[0:29:55] <FalcoLambda> trump card
[0:30:00] <FalcoLambda> it's called a trump card
[0:30:17] <NinjaTB> yea it's called a trump
[0:30:22] <prime_name> When's Kirito?
[0:30:46] <%Solidnick18> woolieSHOOK woolieSHOOK
[0:30:52] <NinjaTB> kirito is trash :)
[0:31:07] <gustavozxd> I like this guy, his moves look stupid af
[0:31:14] <haveswordmuststing> @ninjatb he must be high tier then Kappa
[0:31:16] <Midnight_Crest> imagine picking kirito in anything 4Head
[0:31:29] <NinjaTB> lol
[0:31:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> good pick woolie
[0:31:50] <mercado94> 4Head
[0:31:55] <@Menitta> Who is the boxer archetype in this game
[0:31:57] <gustavozxd> that latest sao where you could create your own character was a huge disappointment solely because you couldn't NTR Kirito
[0:32:04] <poppy_marth> asuna seems like a gorilla
[0:32:04] <+Zoibek> is this the game with saya no uta
[0:32:05] <NinjaTB> i can't say anything, i played kirino in dbfc, and tatsuya in dbfci =/
[0:32:14] <mercado94> Hold the fuck on is that Kino?/
[0:32:19] <haveswordmuststing> @zoibek thats nitroplus(?)
[0:32:22] <+Austinck> how could like SAO after the incest part
[0:32:25] <+Polter_ge1st> They nerfed the crap of Easy bake comboman Kirito in this mode
[0:32:27] <NinjaTB> yup, kino assist
[0:32:37] <haveswordmuststing> i remember the Fisticuffs thumbnail
[0:32:46] <sileo_patronus> @haveswordmuststing yeah nitroplus blasterz
[0:32:50] <mercado94> Holy shit it is Kino
[0:33:00] <ike_shamus> I play asuna and yuuki
[0:33:07] <gustavozxd> @austinck I don't even want to make the joke "but that means it's even better" but yeah some might say
[0:33:18] <zecht89> @Zoibek yep, that cum dumpster is in this
[0:33:23] <@Menitta> woolieOMG
[0:33:41] <haveswordmuststing> man, Capcom Vs Capcom could be real easy to make if they go by roster and assist roster like this or Mahvel 1
[0:33:41] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:33:46] <sileo_patronus> But is the game kino?
[0:33:49] <NinjaTB> wait is saaya in this? i thought that was nitro blasters
[0:33:58] <gustavozxd> nah she's not
[0:34:07] <ike_shamus> saaya isnt in the game
[0:34:09] <zecht89> oh right
[0:34:18] <spardanwarrior> Saaya was in the game with the chick from Senran Kagura
[0:34:20] <%Solidnick18> lol
[0:34:22] <zecht89> got them mixed up
[0:34:25] <%Solidnick18> what the
[0:34:26] <gustavozxd> saaya is in the hentai fighter
[0:34:34] <NinjaTB> ^this
[0:34:37] <+Polter_ge1st> Back A B for armored Universal Overhead
[0:34:42] <gustavozxd> like half that game's roster is from a hentai
[0:34:46] <haveswordmuststing> wont fault you for mixing up the light novel fighters
[0:35:05] <@Menitta> One has Saber, the other has Kirito. Pick your poison
[0:35:18] <FalcoLambda> actually, one's a visual novel fighter and the other's a light novel fighter-- this is the most dweeb thing i've ever said i'm so sorry
[0:35:29] <@Menitta> Its up there.
[0:35:41] <NinjaTB> i thought nitro blasters was fun, til i found out til you could forward dash over cmd grabs. i dropped that game so fast
[0:35:43] <FalcoLambda> the implications of this scare me
[0:35:43] <sileo_patronus> @Menitta Saber every time, fuck that guy
[0:35:52] <sileo_patronus> I don't even care about fate
[0:36:13] <hamahiroyuki> is there a fighter with konosuba characters?
[0:36:13] <Midnight_Crest> @menitta i'll take the hentai chick over a paper towel every time
[0:36:14] <gustavozxd> saber reminds of everything fate related
[0:36:29] <Fujiwara_92> the Trump is an overhead, don't forget Kappa
[0:37:00] <cerazor01> any thing like Dust from guilty gear in this?
[0:37:07] <gustavozxd> this dude just throws furniture and shit it's so stupid LUL
[0:37:10] <PleasantPervert> Where's the RWBY waifus in this crossover whatever game SwiftRage
[0:37:13] <+Polter_ge1st> You also have an armored universal overhead with Back A B
[0:37:25] <sileo_patronus> That was close, reggie isn't pushing buttons hard enough
[0:37:40] <haveswordmuststing> oh right, Selveria is here too
[0:37:44] <@Solidus_113> Taiga!

[0:38:37] <NinjaTB> hit'em wit dat sled
[0:38:39] <sileo_patronus> Yeah taiga absolutely should be rushdown
[0:38:45] <gustavozxd> what's the anime about
[0:38:58] <+8framelag> romcom
[0:38:58] <prime_name> Why is there a Dead or Alive character in this game?
[0:39:01] <FalcoLambda> it's a pretty standard romcom but it sets itself apart with really incredible characters
[0:39:01] <%Solidnick18> yoooo
[0:39:04] <%CJett92> High school romance comedy/drama
[0:39:06] <ManOfReason> LOL summons the fucking pole
[0:39:12] <%CJett92> But it's better than it's genres
[0:39:32] <%NecDW4> Ohh shit, i didnt notice Erio in this
[0:39:34] <+Polter_ge1st> Woolie Akira has rekas
[0:39:40] <FalcoLambda> the characters are its strong point, and its a VERY VERY strong, strong point
[0:39:41] <%Solidnick18> accelerator PogChamp
[0:39:47] <gustavozxd> I've never enjoyed Japanese romance, anime or otherwise

[0:40:02] <goose_attack_almanac> Selvaria Bles when
[0:40:06] <%NeroInfinite> This is one anime ass anime game.
[0:40:10] <%Solidnick18> YEAH
[0:40:16] <jonathandemel> @CJett92 How the hell can something be better than its genres? Genres are neither good nor bad, they're just very general descriptors.
[0:40:22] <PleasantPervert> Where's the good animes in this anime fighter LUL
[0:40:32] <%FuqBoiSlim> What's virtua fighter????
[0:40:39] <goose_attack_almanac> @PleasantPervert Toradora. That's it.
[0:40:39] <Kdillman> Virtua Fighter has been the best anime in it so far
[0:40:42] <powerprotoman> you mean dead or alive right woolie?
[0:40:42] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:40:43] <%gatorafan> In Virtua Fighter all you did was down light punch, that's why you don't remember Kappa
[0:40:58] <Tucker0603> TAIGA is the cutest tsundere ever
[0:41:00] <Midnight_Crest> even sega dont know what virtua fighter is Jebaited
[0:41:06] <%CJett92> @jonathandemel Because they're very generic genres that would make people think it's a super generic show on surface level
[0:41:12] <haveswordmuststing> @gatorafan i think thats Melty Blood your thinking of Kappa
[0:41:14] <sileo_patronus> Is this strong accelerator or less strong accelerator?
[0:41:23] <alrobot2014> @Midnight_Crest virtua fighter is a yakuza mingame LUL
[0:41:44] <+JakeSG> @CJett92 I think that's just like, your opinion man
[0:41:51] <ike_shamus> this game is all about resource management
[0:41:55] <haveswordmuststing> heres to hoping Shenmue is a secret Virtua Fighter 6 prototype

[0:47:50] <%galaxyswirl> isnt that the guy that nullifies magic in magical railgun?
[0:47:51] <hntronium> Yes it matters, because someone is wrong
[0:47:52] <sileo_patronus> @Menitta yes because magic kills these people dead if they use it
[0:47:55] <haveswordmuststing> @menitta IT MATTERS i swear Kappa
[0:48:04] <xiccy> @menitta its very important that she doesn't use magic
[0:48:05] <+8framelag> kinda like the bland version of one punch guy
[0:48:06] <hntronium> It always matters when someone is wrong
[0:48:07] <@Menitta> I knew it didnt matter
[0:48:08] <%CJett92> You dont understand, someone is WRONG on the INTERNET

[0:50:11] <gustavozxd> @necdw4 that's one hell of a sentence

[0:50:24] <mercado94> @gustavozxd OH BOY LUL
[0:50:25] <+Arnschen> The anime stopped pretty early on
[0:50:41] <@Menitta> thats a good magician character

[0:51:28] <Fujiwara_92> oh
[0:51:29] <mercado94> @gustavozxd my mind goes to Soul Eater
[0:51:33] <BackwardCap> Johnning at the character select @WoolieVersus
[0:51:33] <%galaxyswirl> isnt that magical high school?
[0:51:33] <ike_shamus> i still have nightmares fighting of level 5's team

[0:51:52] <%Solidnick18> oh
[0:51:55] <%Solidnick18> fuck i'm blind
[0:51:59] <%NecDW4> Boogiepop Phantom was heckin sweet. The recent version that covered the actual LNs was also good
[0:51:59] <%Tearonex> last order!?
[0:52:01] <@Menitta> I remember watching a little bit of that show. it sucked
[0:52:02] <jonathandemel> Should've been Onii-sama instead of her
[0:52:02] <+Austinck> gun lance
[0:52:08] <sileo_patronus> That's just a gunlance don't lie
[0:52:09] <deafmelone> NiGHTS STAGE!
[0:52:20] <CalderGaming> @jonathandemel he's both an assist and a dlc character
[0:52:23] <reiju_22> Kreygasm
[0:52:33] <jonathandemel> @CalderGaming Nice
[0:52:34] <gustavozxd> @haveswordmuststing one thing I know about that game is that I hate Rex and Pyra and that ending is fucking hilarious
[0:52:58] <jonathandemel> Sounds like Mitsuru
[0:52:59] <%Solidnick18> wtf
[0:53:01] <+8framelag> beam=gattling gun aka lightning move
[0:53:01] <%Solidnick18> lol
[0:53:18] <FalcoLambda> pew pew pew pew
[0:53:25] <%Solidnick18> what
[0:53:27] <%Solidnick18> huh
[0:53:30] <gustavozxd> damn she sounds super pissed off
[0:53:32] <Guntanks_in_Space> who's the lovely guest in the stream this time?
[0:53:51] <Guntanks_in_Space> also tfw my main here was basketball loli just because her specials here are incredibly hilarious
[0:53:52] <+Polter_ge1st> reflection guard is pushblock I believe
[0:53:59] <Guntanks_in_Space> also yea that's pushblock
[0:54:00] <mercado94> should I watch the boogiepop anime? I kinda ignore it when I found out MotherBasement was praising it
[0:54:12] <ike_shamus> that assist is air unblockable
[0:54:18] <FalcoLambda> it's a marvel-style pushblock
[0:54:25] <%NecDW4> @mercado94 do you mean the recent one, or the OLD 90s one
[0:54:29] <gustavozxd> @guntanks_in_space what about the blonde furniture man LUL also I do like the idea of a basketball moveset
[0:54:36] <+Polter_ge1st> @falcolambda yeah yeah
[0:54:49] <@Menitta> God that's like Rotom in Pokken
[0:54:49] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:54:50] <hassanico1> Somehow I got this game confused with Nitroplus Fighters
[0:54:50] <+Arnschen> Boogiepop is pretty interesting. I've only seen a few episodes of the recent one though, I need to get back to it.
[0:54:57] <CalderGaming> @mercado94 if you have the time, why not. better to ignore MB altogether than make decisions with/against his opinions
[0:55:07] <+Arnschen> ^
[0:55:10] <Guntanks_in_Space> @gustavozxd i wanted to also try furniture man lol but Basketball Loli was infinitely hilarious turning the opponent into basketballs and shooting big 3's in her level 3 super lol
[0:55:27] <mercado94> alright I'm going to watch both the new and old version
[0:55:32] <%Solidnick18> who
[0:55:33] <%NecDW4> LAST ORDER!
[0:55:33] <Guntanks_in_Space> alternatively i think i played Taiga or Biribiri
[0:55:42] <sileo_patronus> Wait was that last order?
[0:55:44] <FalcoLambda> the last order counter was nerfed so hard in this game
[0:55:49] <gustavozxd> Zatch Bell
[0:55:51] <sileo_patronus> neat
[0:55:51] <CalderGaming> that was she, yes
[0:56:08] <sileo_patronus> I guess you wouldn't just have accelerator
[0:56:09] <%FuqBoiSlim> read
[0:56:23] <FalcoLambda> in vanilla she could activate as she was coming out but i this game if you hit her as shes coming out it's deactivated
[0:56:28] <+Austinck> I use to watch zatch bell when it was on YTV
[0:56:33] <Sol_Install> it's a full screen and overhead?
[0:56:38] <FalcoLambda> yeah
[0:56:45] <BackwardCap> Spell Casting with my Smart Phone in another world Kappa
[0:56:46] <Sol_Install> god damn
[0:56:56] <OldManDeckardCain> now that's some nine BS LUL
[0:57:16] <sileo_patronus> God I tried to watch that smart phone shit and it failed me immediately
[0:57:19] <hassanico1> Oh, so Woolie enioys the Boss character :D
[0:57:23] <%NecDW4> OHHHH Kuroyukihime time!
[0:57:39] <Guntanks_in_Space> over the other anime LN fighters that came out like this and uhhh, nitro+ blasterz i love this more than the others
[0:57:43] <Fujiwara_92> Kuroyukihime Kreygasm
[0:57:52] <%FuqBoiSlim> yall still watch isekaishit 🤢
[0:57:54] <hassanico1> Nitro+ is fun too
[0:58:05] <zamzoph> @WoolieVersus Accel World is the other thing by SAO guy I think
[0:58:09] <alrobot2014> yep
[0:58:15] <Sol_Install> the butterfly lady a jojo character ok
[0:58:15] <$KnivesEve> how much anime have i missed
[0:58:18] <FalcoLambda> just do the funky mode red wallbounce shenanigans level5, it's the flashiest thing you can do Kappa
[0:58:18] <+Polter_ge1st> She's a stand user
[0:58:18] <+Arnschen> Sadly
[0:58:19] <Fujiwara_92> yeah, but it's actually good
[0:58:23] <%NecDW4> ^
[0:58:23] <%ozzrabbit> Dude, Woolie doesn't realize is, but Accel World is Awesome!
[0:58:29] <mercado94> I never watched accelworld
[0:58:32] <%NecDW4> Yeah Accel actually has real characters
[0:58:34] <+HellCopter> Marginally better
[0:58:34] <FalcoLambda> accel world is actually pretty good
[0:58:34] <haveswordmuststing> oh look, a Persona Kappa
[0:58:36] <%galaxyswirl> wait is that true
[0:58:42] <+Polter_ge1st> @woolieversus but hey she's a stand user
[0:58:43] <+Austinck> its like a stand user mixed with king for seven deadly sins
[0:58:45] <moogleboy1984> isn't that the one where the fat shota turns into an actual pig?
[0:58:48] <%galaxyswirl> i actually liked accel world
[0:58:49] <+8framelag> similar concept; kids in online mmo
[0:58:49] <FalcoLambda> yeah, reki kawahara, who wrote SAO, also wrote accel world
[0:58:56] <hassanico1> No
[0:59:20] <CalderGaming> in true "your favorite anime is shit" style, I'm going to throw it out: almost everything dengeki bunko property represented in this game is mediocre at best, nasty at worst
[0:59:21] <sileo_patronus> A fair amount of it is translated at leasy
[0:59:29] <Guntanks_in_Space> fat shota who turns into this silver pepsiman rollerblader
[0:59:39] <hassanico1> Dengeki as a thing is just not really existing outside Japan, compared to something like Nitro+
[0:59:43] <FalcoLambda> i think all the playable roster except for ro-kyu-bu! is translated in english
[0:59:50] <+8framelag> 'your favorite fighting game is shit' Kappa
[0:59:52] <FalcoLambda> and ako's series
[0:59:57] <spardanwarrior> Accel World is the same world as SAO, but like 100 years in the future IIRC
[1:00:04] <Guntanks_in_Space> @CalderGaming you do have a point there lol. Tomoka is hilarious here, but her source anime/ln/series is ultra-abunai
[1:00:05] <haveswordmuststing> "i hate the band you like"
[1:00:07] <FalcoLambda> yeah, it's actually a sci-fi setting
[1:00:09] <%Solidnick18> woah
[1:00:10] <Fujiwara_92> damn, now I wanna re watch Accel World
[1:00:17] <%Solidnick18> yeah bust out the table
[1:00:23] <%FuqBoiSlim> I think Coolsville sucks
[1:00:31] <+Arnschen> Yeah, I believe Kirito created the tech the use in Accel World though.
[1:00:33] <gamma00> LUL
[1:00:48] <jonathandemel> WEEEEEEBS
[1:00:52] <Lamedhos> evoJapan
[1:01:00] <Guntanks_in_Space> ah, strike the blood
[1:01:00] <+Arnschen> It's the only connection the series has to SAO tho
[1:01:01] <CalderGaming> anyway find and watch Planet With it's gurren-lagann levels of hot-blooded mecha action and really solid in just 12 episodes
[1:01:03] <Sol_Install> LUL
[1:01:07] <%gatorafan> Are they talking french again? Kappa
[1:01:08] <gustavozxd> oh hey, sao franchise is on sale on steam, make sure to save your money and not spend any on it
[1:01:09] <Guntanks_in_Space> aka "NO SENPAI, THIS IS OUR FIGHT"
[1:01:09] <%Solidnick18> i mean
[1:01:15] <+Arnschen> Strike the Blood was alright
[1:01:17] <gordieda20> LUL
[1:01:18] <%galaxyswirl> isnt black bullet the loli murder one?
[1:01:23] <alrobot2014> yup
[1:01:24] <OldManDeckardCain> oh hey, it's the anime which author loves killing children in his works for lulz Kappa
[1:01:32] <Hakuto1> lacking weeb cirAYAYA knowledge
[1:01:34] <Midnight_Crest> yeah black bullet is the loli fest anime
[1:01:34] <+Polter_ge1st> @arnschen dude don't kid yourself
[1:01:37] <@Solidus_113> Where's the Higurashi
[1:01:41] <moogleboy1984> hitscan projectiles in a fighting game
[1:01:45] <spardanwarrior> IIRC there's a chapter in one of the light novels where the protag kicks Kirito's shit in.
[1:01:49] <gamma00> everything is mediocre
[1:01:49] <FalcoLambda> i liked strike the blood!
[1:01:49] <%Solidnick18> lol
[1:01:50] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:01:51] <@Menitta> Sword Art Online? Yeah that was alright Kappa
[1:01:51] <+Austinck> is it like the opening of face off but the whole anime
[1:01:53] <Daba_mk2> Sao is shit tho
[1:01:53] <%CaptainPileDriver> light novels are fine
[1:01:55] <Guntanks_in_Space> look if we wanted higurashi
[1:01:56] <%CJett92> cept Toradora is super good tho
[1:01:56] <hntronium> Jojo was also just alright
[1:01:56] <zamzoph> Shakugan no Shana was alright
[1:01:57] <FalcoLambda> toaru and durarara kick ass though
[1:02:00] <Pnutz409> SAO. that was alright
[1:02:02] <Guntanks_in_Space> Woolie MUST bust out the OUGON MUSOU
[1:02:04] <Hakuto1> SAO abridged was alright
[1:02:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> SAO IS TRASH, next sentence
[1:02:06] <gamma00> drrr was fun
[1:02:07] <ManOfReason> sao was alright Kappa
[1:02:11] <spardanwarrior> Apparently the SAO spinoff is alright
[1:02:12] <%Solidnick18> Sao was alright to a point
[1:02:15] <Fujiwara_92> No, Durarara and Accel are legit good
[1:02:17] <@Solidus_113> KIRITO IS A BEATER
[1:02:18] <%Tearonex> SAO that was alright... for the first season
[1:02:20] <+gurrren_lagannn> Black bullet is about a dude hanging out with lolis
[1:02:23] <CalderGaming> magic high school would like to have a word about mary sue technology
[1:02:24] <+ViewtifulCryo> the sao abridged saved sao
[1:02:25] <moogleboy1984> CUT THAT SHIT OFF! Next anime!
[1:02:26] <+Austinck> But Toradora is amazing
[1:02:27] <%zk_nails> the ultimate in incest
[1:02:28] <mercado94> Sao Alternative? yeah it was fun
[1:02:34] <ScreamLord> SAO Abridge is better in every way
[1:02:35] <+8framelag> sounds like a classic
[1:02:35] <%CaptainPileDriver> remember, kirito's step sister with giant titties needs the dick
[1:02:37] <CalderGaming> AND ultimate incest
[1:02:39] <Baconrath> Magic School Bus PogChamp
[1:02:44] <gustavozxd> Asuna is a goddamn cuck too LUL
[1:02:44] <Pnutz409> Kirito is a virtual child labor boss
[1:02:46] <Fujiwara_92> SAO Alternative is great
[1:02:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> THEY SHOVE CROTCH SHOTS IN THE OPENING
[1:02:49] <gordieda20> LUL
[1:02:52] <FalcoLambda> when yuuki was around in SAO, it was good, but that wasn't for very long
[1:02:54] <haveswordmuststing> who's Gun Boy here

[1:04:38] <sphereshots12> Hello dumpster
[1:04:38] <moogleboy1984> Digimon is the best Isekai
[1:04:39] <Guntanks_in_Space> Iori on an Isekai is incredibly stupid
[1:04:44] <gustavozxd> my little sister can't possibly have hemorrhoids (a real actual thing btw)
[1:04:44] <+Austinck> remeber no judgement zone
[1:04:44] <+Polter_ge1st> Do your dance Do your dance
[1:04:46] <xiccy> Heavy Object
[1:04:49] <FalcoLambda> @gustavozxd it's an abbreviation for "Another World", so basically any anime that transports a literally who rando anime boy/girl into a fantasy world
[1:04:49] <@Menitta> You know what else is Isekai? Chalkzone.
[1:04:49] <Guntanks_in_Space> but i love it. motherfucker shreds a lute like a bass guitar
[1:04:55] <+Austinck> yugioh is the best Isekai
[1:04:57] <jonathandemel> From the same guy who made Toaru
[1:05:01] <Sol_Install> omg chalkzone is an isekai
[1:05:04] <Fujiwara_92> digimon is an isekai
[1:05:09] <Midnight_Crest> Heavy Object aka gundam with circular mechs

[1:05:11] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Menitta why must you do this to me tonight
[1:05:16] <@Menitta> LUL
[1:05:18] <hassanico1> @wolfofsound it's nuts, but turning it part edutainment works
[1:05:22] <%CJett92> The Sonic movie is gonna be a reverse isekai
[1:05:23] <%FuqBoiSlim> Narnia was an isekai too huh... woolieWUT
[1:05:25] <%Solidnick18> Wow
[1:05:26] <@Solidus_113> WOW
[1:05:27] <hassanico1> There are SEHA GIRLS
[1:05:29] <gustavozxd> @haveswordmuststing SeemsGood
[1:05:30] <+8framelag> Sonic would be kinda weird tho
[1:05:31] <%Solidnick18> that's weird
[1:05:32] <CalderGaming> anyone remember .hack//sign, the OG
[1:05:33] <gordieda20> LUL
[1:05:34] <FalcoLambda> every character has unlockable colors, including a Sega reference. the Touma support character has a Sonic color/
[1:05:34] <sileo_patronus> As degenerate as Oreimo is, it actually has writing and characters
[1:05:34] <mercado94> SEHA GIRLS
[1:05:39] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus you played on this on your previous channel, did you forget
[1:05:40] <powerprotoman> moolies biggest misunderstanding is that isekai emans mmo
[1:05:41] <cerazor01> SANIC
[1:05:41] <@Solidus_113> IF this is Sega where the fuck is Miku
[1:05:42] <Sol_Install> @CalderGaming I LOVE MY .HACK
[1:05:43] <%wolfofsound> @hassanico1 I mean it always was, they legit have good workout tips
[1:05:44] <jeffishype> What would be worse though, sonic characters fighting the anime girls or just having this stage.
[1:05:45] <fIashman92> All the stages are Sega stages
[1:05:46] <+8framelag> haha remember that time sonic kissed a human female?
[1:05:47] <+Polter_ge1st> Kirino fights with cosplay
[1:05:47] <chambatron> What is this poverty shit
[1:05:52] <@Menitta> There's a PSO stage in this game
[1:05:53] <zamzoph> @WoolieVersus They're actually like cousins so it's okay
[1:05:53] <hassanico1> SEHA Girls only show up in story mode though
[1:05:55] <EndarkCuli> @Austinck I can't tell whether you're being comical or referring to the arc where Tea duelled a penguin
[1:05:56] <%gatorafan> Will Woolie realize how many SEGA stages are in here?
[1:05:56] <Fujiwara_92> I'm playing Hack gu right now
[1:05:59] <+Arnschen> dot hack is a great series
[1:06:02] <%gatorafan> The answer is no, he won't Kappa
[1:06:03] <%CJett92> Please kick Kirino's ass
[1:06:10] <cerazor01> This is Japan poverty this is
[1:06:20] <357Sneak> zyzxWaa ?
[1:06:20] <Guntanks_in_Space> this ain't even true poverty yet
[1:06:22] <gustavozxd> is it worth it to play the original .hack before GU?
[1:06:23] <+8framelag> kirino was top before, maybe nerfed
[1:06:24] <Midnight_Crest> oh i forgot mashiro was an assist in this
[1:06:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> nah, we watch reggie and woolie play weekly, it can't be any worse then them
[1:06:28] <Guntanks_in_Space> until Woolie streams Melty from his backyard
[1:06:28] <sileo_patronus> If you win then you're playing correctly
[1:06:31] <chambatron> Hey chat how long do these streams last on Tuesday?
[1:06:34] <chambatron> !uptime
[1:06:34] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 6 minutes
[1:06:35] <haveswordmuststing> @cerazor01 do you even B Tatsu
[1:06:40] <+WAIRIR10R> Didnt Kirino actually get together with her brother at the end?
[1:06:41] <@Menitta> Holy shit that chip is insanwe
[1:06:47] <CalderGaming> @powerprotoman can you blame him tho [gestures to a pile of isekai] even Slime gave the gary sue MMO-style powers even though he took the death/reincarnation route
[1:06:49] <+knackirontarkus> Melty in the Denny’s parking lot let’s go
[1:06:51] <%CJett92> @WAIRIR10R yes
[1:06:52] <%FuqBoiSlim> we had western poverty last time so it's only fair we get japanese poverty this stream
[1:06:52] <cerazor01> yes
[1:06:54] <jonathandemel> @WAIRIR10R Yeh, incest route is canon
[1:06:56] <+Austinck> @EndarkCuli yes that penguin who was an old man wanted that young Japanese girl body
[1:06:58] <cerazor01> she did
[1:06:59] <buffmiku> Nice to see boogiepop getting some love
[1:07:04] <jeffishype> . isnt sham-show out?
[1:07:05] <Guntanks_in_Space> what was the western poverty last stream? @FuqBoiSlim
[1:07:06] <chronoxgp> !uptime
[1:07:06] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 7 minutes
[1:07:07] <Fujiwara_92> @gustavozxd yeah, but the last recode has a way for you to catch up... you're gonna lose some context but not much...
[1:07:07] <+8framelag> @WAIRIR10R 'not blood related' PogChamp
[1:07:07] <FalcoLambda> pushblock is any 2 attack buttons while blocking.
[1:07:14] <FalcoLambda> B+C is the best combination to choose because if you mash A+B you may accidentally use one of your punishable reversal moves
[1:07:18] <+WAIRIR10R> Wow lmao
[1:07:19] <haveswordmuststing> @jeffishype SamSho is released and it is grear
[1:07:23] <%wolfofsound> Listen chat Japan REALLY needs you to fuck. If it has to be relatives then so be it, but they need babies numbers up
[1:07:25] <Jathspuh> Use Accelerator
[1:07:25] <%FuqBoiSlim> @guntanks_in_space fantasy strike or something
[1:07:35] <hassanico1> Kirino's damage seems low
[1:07:36] <Guntanks_in_Space> oh god fantasy strike. SIRLIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIM
[1:07:39] <Guntanks_in_Space> SIRLIN*
[1:07:44] <%CJett92> @wolfofsound but mai waifu tho
[1:07:45] <hassanico1> Oh wait Woolie is playing a boss again
[1:07:52] <FalcoLambda> do the ufo catcher super
[1:08:02] <sileo_patronus> @hassanico1 damage seems low in general tbh
[1:08:05] <%wolfofsound> @CJett92 Hey if you want to put a mask over the girl that's fine just slam her till she's preggers
[1:08:08] <jonathandemel> Why do Japanese series always try to justify incest with the whole "not blood-related" thing. Just make them full on sibling-diddlers, it's not real, it's ok
[1:08:10] <TheBrunoZone> @wolfofsound How could anyone argue with that logiv?
[1:08:15] <%galaxyswirl> WAIT
[1:08:17] <mercado94> @wolfofsound shut up Abe I don't want kids!
[1:08:21] <TheBrunoZone> *logic
[1:08:25] <%CJett92> @wolfofsound you know what thats fair
[1:08:31] <%galaxyswirl> is that the autistic girl from the pet light novel?
[1:08:36] <FalcoLambda> yeah
[1:08:37] <gustavozxd> @jonathandemel oh the non blood related thing doesn't happen as often as you'd think LUL
[1:08:45] <%galaxyswirl> whats the name of it?
[1:08:50] <cerazor01> this makes me uncomfortable
[1:08:50] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:08:52] <FalcoLambda> the pet girl of sakurasou
[1:08:58] <ScreamLord> Gun Lance will reign supreme
[1:09:01] <%wolfofsound> I mean do you guys remember the story where the guy marries the little girl he raised who saw him as a father?
[1:09:01] <countgaculatv> YO SHE WENT IN
[1:09:01] <gustavozxd> PET GIRL
[1:09:01] <%galaxyswirl> thats it!
[1:09:01] <%FuqBoiSlim> cuz you can mary your cousin in Japan but not your blood-related sibling
[1:09:06] <jonathandemel> @gustavozxd I see it a shitload in the ones where they actually go into it
[1:09:09] <%Solidnick18> woolieWUT
[1:09:09] <Guntanks_in_Space> also on that tangent of Samsho, there was a stream of it here several weeks ago with the brother LordJimmyBones lol
[1:09:12] <+Polter_ge1st> Hit em with the Crane Game Super
[1:09:17] <FalcoLambda> weird that i remembered that off the top of my head
[1:09:17] <jonathandemel> @FuqBoiSlim BUT IT'S NOT REAL
[1:09:18] <Guntanks_in_Space> it was a beautiful stream
[1:09:20] <+8framelag> the sequel was better
[1:09:26] <%FuqBoiSlim> @jonathandemel BUT THE LAWS
[1:09:28] <%wolfofsound> @FuqBoiSlim just tell them it's a half sister
[1:09:38] <$KnivesEve> boss characters are no match to the power of the imouto
[1:09:43] <%CJett92> uuuuuuuuuggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhh
[1:09:44] <FalcoLambda> THEREIT IS
[1:09:46] <gordieda20> LUL
[1:09:47] <%FuqBoiSlim> @wolfofsound nah, they still share on parent. it's too close for Abe
[1:09:55] <%CJett92> worst girl always wins
[1:09:56] <+Austinck> im surpized no one from highschool dxd isn't in this
[1:10:10] <+8framelag> same publisher?
[1:10:11] <jonathandemel> @Austinck DxD is dengeki bunko?
[1:10:13] <mercado94> Abe doesn't care
[1:10:14] <haveswordmuststing> Look at this Mugen shit
[1:10:17] <@Solidus_113> Reggie, it's not Daddy. It's Onii-chan
[1:10:18] <Guntanks_in_Space> was DXD a Dengeki thing?
[1:10:26] <sileo_patronus> Aw no kuroko I guess
[1:10:29] <gustavozxd> is the name of this game's currency CP? LUL
[1:10:33] <Guntanks_in_Space> ^
[1:10:33] <jonathandemel> Shana=
[1:10:36] <+Polter_ge1st> LAB KIRITO
[1:10:37] <gustavozxd> of all the games
[1:10:44] <Fujiwara_92> LAB KIRITO LUL
[1:10:44] <Guntanks_in_Space> oh god lol i forgot GODTIER ONIICHAN was here
[1:10:46] <%wolfofsound> oh shitshitshitshit japanese jesus is in this game?!
[1:10:51] <+Jotamide> Reminder that Sega won't localize this, or Blade Arcus Rebellion, or make VF6
[1:10:57] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah JESUS ONIICHAN is here
[1:10:57] <%FuqBoiSlim> Kiss X Sis > OreImo you know I'm right chat
[1:11:02] <FourSwissRollsNothingMore> anime akira WutFace
[1:11:04] <+Polter_ge1st> Show them the easy bake combos
[1:11:05] <%wolfofsound> he has the power of GUN
[1:11:10] <Guntanks_in_Space> @FuqBoiSlim i loath Oreimo enough to actually agree with you lol
[1:11:13] <Gurbetsjov> PICK HOLO
[1:11:16] <+8framelag> weird they only localized the previous version?
[1:11:26] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah this came out only JP and never on PC either
[1:11:33] <KitsuneManami> Selvaria for Life
[1:11:38] <gustavozxd> the fact that there's a discussion between the two degenerate incest anime is the worst
[1:11:40] <Guntanks_in_Space> when Blade Strangers and the other examu/french bread 2d anime fighters did
[1:11:40] <+Jotamide> @8framelag They literally released it 2 months before Ignition was released in Japan
[1:11:49] <FalcoLambda> your blast character increases the size of the burst they represent, if you press start/option when hovering over them, you can change what blast they affect manually
[1:11:51] <+8framelag> probably didn't sell enough and annoying to deal with licensing?
[1:11:52] <didgereedoodah> I didn't know Virtua Fighter was poverty anime
[1:11:53] <+Jotamide> Sega of Japan give no fucks what NA or EU do
[1:12:09] <Guntanks_in_Space> realistically, yea
[1:12:14] <haveswordmuststing> @didgereedoodah it is now doodSad
[1:12:15] <+Austinck> nope higschool dxd not published by them
[1:12:25] <gustavozxd> oh yeah there's a PSO lobby stage now that I remember
[1:12:33] <FalcoLambda> yeah, the shop area
[1:12:34] <FourSwissRollsNothingMore> i'm confused BibleThump

[1:13:24] <%CaptainPileDriver> link
[1:13:26] <chronoxgp> i have the regular version of this game it's meh
[1:13:54] <Guntanks_in_Space> thanks, wool
[1:13:58] <ike_shamus> Ignition made the game good imo
[1:14:01] <jonathandemel> Real MVP
[1:14:03] <ike_shamus> i hated vanilla
[1:14:10] <Guntanks_in_Space> vanilla is weeeeeeeeeeeeeird
[1:14:15] <%Wool> Page 2 is the health/meter shit
[1:14:50] <+Polter_ge1st> @ike_shamus vanilla was unbalanced as all hell
[1:14:52] <memenavy> What's up everyone?
[1:14:56] <+8framelag> moonrunes
[1:15:11] <jonathandemel> DON'T HIT THE LOLI
[1:15:13] <Bamcc2> Is that Akira?
[1:15:16] <ike_shamus> vanilla was not fun to play
[1:15:18] <FalcoLambda> yes
[1:15:18] <memenavy> yep
[1:15:18] <sileo_patronus> Oh she's bait, that makes sense
[1:15:20] <Guntanks_in_Space> wasn't vanilla DFC riddled with uhh, Kirino vs Taiga all day
[1:15:25] <FalcoLambda> vanilla is just a barebones fighting game
[1:15:28] <Guntanks_in_Space> all i know was Kirino was dumb
[1:15:35] <FalcoLambda> kirino was very very strong
[1:15:36] <+8framelag> isn't the meta mostly the same from 1? shana/kirino?
[1:15:42] <Guntanks_in_Space> maybe Shana and Taiga too
[1:15:47] <FalcoLambda> kirino's still strong just not as strong
[1:15:53] <anarchistPastry> @Bamcc2 yup
[1:15:54] <KitsuneManami> Just play Selvaria
[1:15:54] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:16:01] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> game has Taiga Aisaka, game is good
[1:16:12] <+Polter_ge1st> I remember cheesing with Easy Kirito combos lol
[1:16:37] <@Menitta> that shit has made me consider getting a 2nd arcade stick with a pad
[1:16:41] <jonathandemel> BOUCE
[1:17:07] <chronoxgp> i bought it because the waiter from dardarara was in it, but there arent any defense options it's all attack
[1:17:24] <ike_shamus> Akira/Erio(futon girl) are a good team
[1:17:31] <Guntanks_in_Space> his super is the goddamn Stun Palm of Doom
[1:17:44] <Guntanks_in_Space> also his other is VF2 GATTLING JAB
[1:17:48] <Guntanks_in_Space> i just realized
[1:18:06] <+Polter_ge1st> @guntanks_in_space yup yup
[1:18:29] <+8framelag> pushblock is free.. when in climax or lower life?
[1:18:43] <FalcoLambda> yeah
[1:18:53] <FalcoLambda> if your opponent has the life lead, your pushblock is free
[1:19:08] <FalcoLambda> also note that when you have lower health, a little light at the bottom of your lifebar turns on
[1:19:22] <+Bigdrifter210> ss launcher?
[1:19:36] <FalcoLambda> good to keep in mind when the round is running out of time and both players are neck on neck
[1:19:55] <sileo_patronus> @FalcoLambda oh that white notch?
[1:19:58] <FalcoLambda> yeah!
[1:20:01] <sileo_patronus> neat
[1:20:07] <+Dull_Fangs> looool we're playing this
[1:20:11] <FalcoLambda> this game has lots of neat small QoL details
[1:20:38] <sileo_patronus> Now if only it had the bigger QoL detail of being in more than one language
[1:21:00] <FalcoLambda> i've become accustomed to JP releases at this point, but i totally get it
[1:21:02] <+Dull_Fangs> this is a pre FBM game
[1:21:26] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the weeb carries you if you believe enough, multiple languages are therefore clearly superfluous
[1:21:40] <+Dull_Fangs> they were saving up money to bribe wizard for this year
[1:21:43] <chronoxgp> is pushblock in the base US game?
[1:21:44] <FalcoLambda> the training mode is the only real issue if you're worried about language
[1:21:53] <+Dull_Fangs> reverse beat is a FB staple
[1:21:57] <FalcoLambda> the other menus are either easy to tell or are just straight up in english
[1:22:15] <+Dull_Fangs> actually is this a four button game with C being ex moves
[1:22:33] <FalcoLambda> A+B is EX
[1:22:37] <+Dull_Fangs> huh
[1:22:40] <FalcoLambda> ABC are light medium heavy
[1:22:46] <+Dull_Fangs> is D tag
[1:22:51] <FalcoLambda> assist, yeah
[1:22:55] <Guntanks_in_Space> A+B is usually the uh, armored/invincible reversal no?
[1:22:55] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:23:05] <sileo_patronus> And A+B is on R1 yeah?
[1:23:09] <FalcoLambda> yeah, guntanks, but if you do a special input before the AB you get an EX move
[1:23:11] <Sol_Install> okay maybe it just me but sounds a bit like BBTag then but that's just me
[1:23:14] <FalcoLambda> idk about macros
[1:23:23] <Guntanks_in_Space> oh that explains shit
[1:23:30] <Guntanks_in_Space> there are command normals i believe
[1:23:52] <FalcoLambda> it's not similar to BBTAG at all, if you go in expecting it to be like BBTAG you won't get it
[1:24:20] <+Dull_Fangs> this game has OG assets for one
[1:24:27] <FalcoLambda> LUL
[1:24:29] <sileo_patronus> Assists seem to come in pretty fast and loose
[1:24:52] <FalcoLambda> people are actually speculating that this game will get added to TAG
[1:24:56] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the sprites do look rather nice
[1:25:08] <FalcoLambda> they look slightly cleaner than UNIST sprites
[1:25:26] <Guntanks_in_Space> i mean, this was a french bread jam right?
[1:25:32] <chronoxgp> ah well apparently this game has a game manuel and it's deeper thnan what i thought
[1:25:32] <sileo_patronus> But UNIST's style though
[1:25:33] <haveswordmuststing> @falcolambda more likely than Senran Kagura
[1:25:33] <FalcoLambda> yeah! sega + french bread
[1:25:38] <+Dull_Fangs> what
[1:25:43] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> no wonder then
[1:25:43] <+Dull_Fangs> this is just LN characters
[1:25:47] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah
[1:25:48] <+Anonymasque> Is that Akira
[1:25:54] <Guntanks_in_Space> LN characters, and Akira (and Selvaria)
[1:26:05] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> and taiga, and shana?
[1:26:20] <Guntanks_in_Space> don't those two have LNs?
[1:26:26] <FalcoLambda> yeah, they're LNs
[1:26:29] <+Dull_Fangs> btw did who ever is playing end up going to Climax of the Night
[1:26:30] <+Polter_ge1st> Don't forget Quarter Circle forward ABC to do Powered Up Super that takes 2 bar and a Trump card
[1:26:34] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> and...wait is durarara a ln?
[1:26:41] <@Menitta> Did anyone rip this Akira sprite into a Mugen character
[1:26:45] <FalcoLambda> yeah
[1:26:48] <Guntanks_in_Space> yup
[1:26:49] <chronoxgp> shizuo is from durarara
[1:26:52] <@Menitta> Great
[1:26:53] <FalcoLambda> most of this game's cast have been ripped into MUGEN characters
[1:26:57] <+Dull_Fangs> @Menitta better, they mooded it into UNIEL
[1:26:58] <+Polter_ge1st> All of them are in Mugen
[1:27:01] <sileo_patronus> Oh I bet this entire game has been mugen'd
[1:27:02] <spacecatstreams> dengeki bunko is fun to say
[1:27:03] <haveswordmuststing> @kosorsomesaykosm_ its the most light novel
[1:27:04] <%AnthraxJohnson> AnthraxJohnson subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[1:27:05] <Guntanks_in_Space> actually there was some sprite fuckery done with this going into UNIST i believe
[1:27:10] <@Menitta> @Dull_Fangs Oh shit thats crazy
[1:27:28] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> huh, I was only aware of the drrr anime. well then
[1:27:32] <Guntanks_in_Space> lol Asuna
[1:27:38] <MimicTheDragon> Selvaria FeelsGoodMan
[1:27:55] <Guntanks_in_Space> Selvaria, aka Raita doing Raita things
[1:27:55] <+Dull_Fangs> hey speaking of VC how good was 4
[1:27:56] <+Polter_ge1st> Lab Kirito and his easy bake Rekas
[1:27:58] <+8framelag> remember using asuna in this game
[1:28:04] <sileo_patronus> You think I'm weak? I don't need light, give me the heavy novel
[1:28:08] <Guntanks_in_Space> wait wasn't Asuna also ap opular pick at the time?
[1:28:09] <memenavy> If only people knew what this is from
[1:28:12] <FalcoLambda> it's a Sega Hard Girls stage!
[1:28:13] <memenavy> NEVERMIND
[1:28:13] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> was that a duckin sonic stage or is the sleep deprivation kicking in
[1:28:18] <+Polter_ge1st> Sega Hard Girls
[1:28:19] <mercado94> IT IS
[1:28:21] <Kalcom> is that sans
[1:28:22] <FalcoLambda> so woolie recognizing it light that is completely right
[1:28:22] <+Dull_Fangs> bruh sega hard drive girls in this game would be GL
[1:28:29] <%FuqBoiSlim> Woolie Vs Bayonetta part 2 is out woolieGASM
[1:28:33] <Guntanks_in_Space> one school says chao, the other gaskwang?
[1:28:47] <haveswordmuststing> @fuqboislim YT push notifications on point
[1:28:55] <%FuqBoiSlim> chao-see-oh-nay
[1:28:56] <+Dull_Fangs> hey speaking of Anime has woolie talked about how Akiohko now has a 6f over head in BBTag
[1:29:26] <FalcoLambda> akihiko's like top 5 in BBTAG right now as well, dude's insane
[1:29:37] <%Wool> Akihiko has some dummy thicc damage in BBTag
[1:29:41] <+Dull_Fangs> truly pachi's greatest work
[1:29:46] <Sol_Install> akihiko went from a car into a fucking rail gun
[1:29:58] <%FuqBoiSlim> Woolie must be proud a character he likes is actually top tier for once
[1:29:59] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:29:59] <+Dull_Fangs> no but it cost one bar
[1:30:04] <+Dull_Fangs> balance
[1:30:20] <%badmr7> badmr7 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! nice stream Woolie!
[1:30:33] <+Dull_Fangs> @FuqBoiSlim man was going to play Virgil in MvC3 if he was dog shit
[1:30:43] <+Dull_Fangs> and he played Zero regardless
[1:30:59] <+Anonymasque> What is this crossover madness??
[1:31:22] <+Dull_Fangs> And Baiken was pretty good in AC
[1:31:23] <Pnutz409> old man fingers
[1:31:28] <chronoxgp> this game was 40 bucks after a couple of months
[1:31:28] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> woolie dies on stream from anime overdose
[1:31:39] <+Dull_Fangs> Esports is a young man's game
[1:31:44] <MimicTheDragon> Put Selvaria in VF6 Kappa
[1:32:07] <+Dull_Fangs> he also played dumb ass Makoto in 3S
[1:32:30] <+ikasukiz> you got characters from Sword Art Online... and a bunch of other series from the same light novel publisher. Also Sega pbulsihed this game so there's a bunch of Sega-themed content including two playable characters
[1:32:35] <+ikasukiz> @Anonymasque
[1:32:51] <+Dull_Fangs> bruh
[1:32:52] <ike_shamus> no IB in this game
[1:33:05] <ike_shamus> Selv is not good in this game FYI
[1:33:15] <+Dull_Fangs> projectiles with follow ups
[1:33:29] <ike_shamus> its punishable
[1:33:41] <+Dull_Fangs> Hyde aint shit now
[1:34:38] <+Anonymasque> @ikasukiz Thanks for the deets.
[1:34:41] <+8framelag> didn't this crossover come about by; Dengeki wanting anniversary/promotion and Sega contacting FB to make a new game for Club Sega Arcades
[1:35:01] <+Anonymasque> Jesus why doesn't this come up when people talk about Smash?
[1:35:01] <Guntanks_in_Space> pretty much
[1:35:13] <+Dull_Fangs> is UNI even in Club sega
[1:35:28] <Guntanks_in_Space> UNI runs on Sega's arcade hadware no? it should be lol
[1:35:28] <%FuqBoiSlim> I wish more anime got 2d fighters instead of the arena brawlers I'm pissed about the opm game. In a better world Genos would be doing sick trillion damage mvc combos pknFBM
[1:35:50] <%FuqBoiSlim> bring back tvc
[1:35:52] <haveswordmuststing> @fuqboislim that Tier list must be simple LUL
[1:36:02] <+Dull_Fangs> Is battle arena (the main UNI arcade) a club sega affiliate
[1:36:07] <+8framelag> gotta bring back marvel first PogChamp
[1:36:20] <+Dull_Fangs> TvC is the GoaT don't @ me
[1:36:26] <goose_attack_almanac> ...Valkyria Chronicles is great
[1:36:27] <haveswordmuststing> @dull_fangs @
[1:36:30] <+Wynzler> I blame CyberConnect
[1:36:34] <+Dull_Fangs> fuck u birch
[1:36:38] <%FuqBoiSlim> @haveswordmuststing I'm not sure saitama's a character I think hes just the dummy in training mode
[1:36:44] <haveswordmuststing> @wynzler blame Bandai Namco
[1:36:54] <+Wynzler> Them too
[1:37:00] <+Anonymasque> Yeah! Teach that Asuna a lesson!!
[1:37:01] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:37:11] <Pnutz409> when's Kirito? Kappa
[1:37:13] <+Dull_Fangs> blame spries being hard to do too
[1:37:22] <@Menitta> I dont like the scaling of this stage
[1:37:22] <haveswordmuststing> @pnutz409 never suprisingly enough
[1:37:33] <ike_shamus> also, for that asuna combo, pickup with 2a not 5ab
[1:37:35] <+Wynzler> Harder to do than 3d models?
[1:37:38] <+8framelag> and xrd looking great
[1:37:48] <Pnutz409> lol @Wynzler
[1:38:03] <Pnutz409> Play some Pokken.
[1:38:06] <+Wynzler> I'm asking because I don't actually know, I'm ignorant
[1:38:08] <EXKiddo> Yo how do I get in on this
[1:38:12] <theangryguyofde> I remember the first game people said every character had the same frame data. Bad time to play Taiga LUL
[1:38:15] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh yeah, pokken exists
[1:38:22] <@Menitta> everyone should play pokken
[1:38:24] <EXKiddo> DFCI is my favorite FG
[1:38:29] <+Wynzler> Pokken is wasted potential imo
[1:38:38] <@Menitta> Its the best Pokemon game on Switch
[1:38:42] <Pnutz409> Wasted? its fun af
[1:38:51] <+Dull_Fangs> From a support view or just form a game play perspective
[1:38:56] <+8framelag> maybe not harder just time consuming and less dedicated sprite artists (not lo-fi 4/8bit)
[1:39:00] <deafmelone> whens Digikken? Kappa
[1:39:02] <+Wynzler> Both
[1:39:07] <sileo_patronus> I'd like Pokken more if it didn't have the goofy top-down mode
[1:39:07] <lemon_lore> o players?
[1:39:10] <+Polter_ge1st> Play Kirito Against him
[1:39:10] <+Dull_Fangs> KSB still holds it down
[1:39:12] <%Wool> 1
[1:39:14] <CrippledRoach> 1
[1:39:16] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it has tsundere braixen so it's worth something at least
[1:39:16] <BlueEmerald> 1
[1:39:16] <ike_shamus> 1
[1:39:17] <Hoshikori0> 1
[1:39:20] <Pnutz409> scene is still stronk.
[1:39:22] <%FuqBoiSlim> I'll give Pokken props for giving my boy Chandelure some shine but i remember playing it on the wii u and not being big on it
[1:39:30] <+Polter_ge1st> Best him with Kirito
[1:39:31] <haveswordmuststing> can we just update Pokken to have 800 playable pokemon and call it a day Kappa
[1:39:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> i'm not
[1:39:39] <+Dull_Fangs> Didn't it have a varible frame rate on Wii U
[1:39:41] <+Anonymasque> This game isn't available for PS4 in Eng huh?
[1:39:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> i'm not getting this japanese account
[1:39:55] <%Wool> This is literally my first time playing but I'll win through sheer anime fundamentals.
[1:39:56] <Pnutz409> Use Kirito lol
[1:40:00] <ike_shamus> i put it on blast in the DFCI discord
[1:40:01] <%CaptainPileDriver> it was 20 bucks how could i not

[1:40:05] <FalcoLambda> i have this game and a JP account but i don't feel good about going up against him since i'm in the UK
[1:40:07] <+Dull_Fangs> When's Koiheme
[1:40:13] <+Dull_Fangs> you cowards
[1:40:14] <@Menitta> So Wool is basically saying "Yeah I dont even play this game"
[1:40:20] <FalcoLambda> i'm wired up but the connection might still not be good
[1:40:20] <CrippledRoach> Damn it, lol.

[1:41:21] <+Wynzler> That would be dope
[1:41:23] <fIashman92> It's Border Break, the Sega arcade game

[1:55:01] <+Polter_ge1st> @wool THE ONE BUTTON REKAS
[1:55:04] <Guntanks_in_Space> is this Biribiri's Yuri Partner
[1:55:05] <Pnutz409> does she do Mother's Rosario?
[1:55:09] <EXKiddo> Yuuki is the best before assists come into play tho
[1:55:14] <TigerClaws12> is this the game that has Iori in it?
[1:55:16] <ike_shamus> I picked up yuuki two weeks ago, i played asuna prior
[1:55:19] <FalcoLambda> no, tiger

[1:55:25] <FalcoLambda> this is the one with akira yuki
[1:55:30] <TigerClaws12> oh ok
[1:55:31] <EXKiddo> She's easily the most independant character
[1:55:45] <sileo_patronus> Good to see kuroko has all of her bullshit
[1:55:47] <%Solidnick18> nice
[1:55:55] <ike_shamus> and with my assist, i turn the game into guilty gear

[2:24:57] <cerazor01> ? Endlag?
[2:25:01] <+chrishnaw> I keep hearing stories from people who claim they played PSO on GameCube
[2:25:03] <Tekaii00> Pso2 still has this lobby lol
[2:25:15] <FalcoLambda> to be fair about smash players calling recovery endlag, they have an acual thing in their game called a recovery
[2:25:16] <cerazor01> Isn't pso2 being released in English?
[2:25:16] <Guntanks_in_Space> PSO was on gamecube iirc
[2:25:22] <@Menitta> If you didnt play with the gamecube keyboard, you cannot say you have played video games
[2:25:24] <FalcoLambda> so they should ideally be differentiating the two
[2:25:26] <+801braxton> pso2 is actualy garbage
[2:25:28] <zamzoph> Shana PunOko
[2:25:28] <chronoxgp> pso2 on xbox 1
[2:25:29] <Guntanks_in_Space> i think a private server was based on that
[2:25:35] <ike_shamus> Abister is scary, makes me look like i dont know how to play the game

[2:26:04] <@Menitta> The southeast asian version of PSO2 which is F2P grindy bs sucks yes.

[2:36:32] <SilentRukei> OH NO THAT PAUSE

[2:36:32] <memenavy> This 3D disgusts me
[2:36:38] <FalcoLambda> kinda like blade strangers but they look a lot cleaner

[2:37:29] <+DingusMcFadden> I'm feel nauseous
[2:37:31] <Guntanks_in_Space> i thought those were sprites. less noticeable 3D compared to say, Shining Blade Arcus
[2:37:31] <haveswordmuststing> this game does in fact, have Nooch
[2:37:34] <@Menitta> if they're 3D then someone went through all the trouble to put em in mugen...
[2:37:39] <Guntanks_in_Space> Neutch

[2:37:50] <fIashman92> She's 14. Much better
[2:37:51] <cerazor01> I like the ingame model/sprites
[2:37:55] <CalderGaming> this is Yue Jin vs. Sun Shangxiang
[2:37:57] <cerazor01> But the art makes me retch
[2:37:57] <$SWFanatic> Ryu grew boobs

[2:38:16] <Applecannon63> rotoscopping 3d sprites
[2:38:17] <@Menitta> Ooooh ok that makes sense
[2:38:21] <SilentRukei> Man her fireball sure reminds me of a certain Japanese spies fireball
[2:38:29] <Nick_Degica> I'd play but everyone would just wreck me badly
[2:38:56] <countgaculatv> Oh shit you're playing this.

[2:40:55] <Guntanks_in_Space> if you counterhit with it, it launches big iirc
[2:40:59] <%CaptainPileDriver> REGGIE, DP MOTION IS A GRAB
[2:41:00] <+8framelag> unconventional mechanics needs niche corefan base - probably why it doesn't cater to mainstream aesthetics
[2:41:25] <+DingusMcFadden> Yeah, that's prolly why it's so gross, @CaptainPileDriver . Good point
[2:41:36] <%CaptainPileDriver> lol, ikr?
[2:41:57] <Omgbasedjay> Wooliwoooo
[2:41:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> the super is basically samsho's super motion

[2:42:24] <SilentRukei> Wtf?

[2:55:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> god, it feels like the cops are gonna show up with the noises made from this game
[2:56:07] <+Jotamide> The devs for this game are doglike
[2:56:20] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> He's a Corrections Officer
[2:56:23] <+Jotamide> I hope their next game has a better / more recognizable IP tied to it
[2:56:35] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> ya'll scrubs are UNDER ARREST
[2:56:35] <mr_slaide> Kind of... It's a gender bender anime fighter game based on the RoTK characters.
[2:56:52] <mr_slaide> Oh no! Under arrest again!
[2:57:01] <%RyuuAoi> EAT SHIT
[2:57:03] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> FUCK the Romance of the 3 Kingdoms
[2:57:14] <+doctor_piss_inspect> forsenLewd
[2:57:15] <mr_slaide> Although, to be honest, this series started as a hentai series...
[2:57:16] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> STOP IT JAPAN its not COOL ANYMORE
[2:57:27] <SilentRukei> Is RoTK worth it?
[2:57:36] <Nick_Degica> The funny thing is the most fun thing to see, the juggle combos, are almost never seen at high level just because you don't see people get gonged often.
[2:57:42] <RunningNGunning> Rules for tournaments for this game should have everyone who loses in pools immediately gets arrested by the FBI
[2:57:42] <+Jotamide> There's tons of fighting games based on eroge
[2:57:47] <mr_slaide> Depends. The Dynasty warrior series? The RoTK strategy games?
[2:57:47] <SilentRukei> Asking for a friend?
[2:57:53] <mr_slaide> The book?
[2:57:55] <+Jotamide> Big Bang Beat, Alice Senki, Melty counts too
[2:58:00] <SilentRukei> The Book
[2:58:09] <FalcoLambda> i'm gonna take it easy for the night, you guys take care
[2:58:11] <Zeroroute> Fate Unlimited Codes
[2:58:15] <GreatestGuess> Lu Bu on the left
[2:58:23] <Guntanks_in_Space> Fate Unlimited Codes da gawd
[2:58:32] <mr_slaide> What is your friend tolerance level for exaggerated "historical" stories?
[2:58:34] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @FalcoLambda You can take it as easy as you want, cause you're FREE
[2:58:50] <Nick_Degica> I just call it gong because of the sound
[2:58:54] <katocrimson> cao cao is proud of what his legacy has become
[2:58:57] <FalcoLambda> BIbleThump why do people have to tell me things i already know
[2:59:00] <+doctor_piss_inspect> Krushing Blows PogChamp
[2:59:10] <FalcoLambda> i've made a habit of consistently fucking that emote up BibleThump
[2:59:17] <Guntanks_in_Space> i actually assumed the fatal counters here were called Gongs
[2:59:21] <FalcoLambda> anyway good night <3
[2:59:27] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> because we all get reminded of our scrubness
[2:59:29] <%jubejube56> There is something weird about the animation in this game
[2:59:30] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> night
[2:59:32] <SilentRukei> @mr_slaide I'll just say Fate takes exaggerated history too far sometimes imo
[2:59:34] <%jubejube56> reminds me of Mortal Kombat
[2:59:43] <Nick_Degica> Those are the three typse of juggles you can do during a gong. you can't repeat one. I really like that they added those in RyoRaiRai (the indicators)
[2:59:53] <justanotherbambi> My first ever arcade stick came in today :)
[2:59:55] <MeiraF> @WoolieVersus hey whatsup woolie, do you still keep in contact with the sleepycabin guys?
[2:59:55] <+Jotamide> 3B/6B/6C are the Hougeki buttons
[3:00:05] <+Jotamide> 3C is not the best starter
[3:00:20] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> You want exagerated history? look at One Piece... I don't think anything about Devils Fruit is historically accurate
[3:00:22] <mr_slaide> @SilentRukei Oh, it's nowhere near as exaggerated as Fate. It's more realistic and somewhat based on history. Is your friend remotely knowledgeable on that era?
[3:00:33] <SilentRukei> Nope
[3:00:42] <GreatestGuess> 3C is occasionally special cancel, so it can be a safer move to use
[3:00:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> rumtumtugnutz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! T
[3:00:51] <mr_slaide> One Piece is fantasy. It's not historical.

[3:00:58] <LoveXKnife> tiddy samsho
[3:01:01] <+Jotamide> Kan'u 3C sucks tho lol
[3:01:10] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @mr_slaide tell that to Japan, its basically a religion
[3:01:11] <Guntanks_in_Space> more like tiddy ROTK SF4
[3:01:24] <Guntanks_in_Space> or at least that's what the internet called it at one point
[3:01:28] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> SF4 was already pretty Tiddy
[3:01:35] <mr_slaide> @Breakfast_Megapowers Yeah, but even they know it's purely fantasy.
[3:01:36] <%jubejube56> I feel like One Piece needs to end in modern day
[3:01:36] <Guntanks_in_Space> i mean, you're not wrong lol

[3:03:37] <mr_slaide> Lube Bu for Summer Slam.
[3:03:38] <Nick_Degica> Ryofu is a beast.
[3:03:54] <Applecannon63> Oh yeah One Piece has character's face based on celebrities

[3:04:59] <mr_slaide> I think he will be the "end boss".
[3:05:09] <mr_slaide> He's already kinda broken.
[3:05:27] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah wasn't lu bu the boss in the previous revision of this
[3:05:37] <Applecannon63> I mean he took White Beard's power
[3:05:37] <Guntanks_in_Space> @MightyMaxT i've seen that picture
[3:05:38] <+doctor_piss_inspect> 75 frame hit confirm PogChamp
[3:05:39] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I think One Piece will end in a royale rumble fashion with Luffy Kaidou, Aizawa and Teach
[3:06:18] <SilentRukei> why are there two open slots on the assist select?
[3:06:19] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Marineford 2 if you will
[3:06:21] <Guntanks_in_Space> oh hey it's sun quan, the character i actually liked playing here- oh they didn't pick her
[3:06:31] <dero45> I’m I on a list now that I watch this stream
[3:06:40] <Guntanks_in_Space> Romance of the 3 Kingdoms if you will
[3:06:44] <$Rezca> Please read Three Kingdoms
[3:06:49] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> *historically accurate fighting game
[3:06:49] <mr_slaide> No, Dero45, we are the arrested.
[3:06:51] <%Solidnick18> yes
[3:06:59] <poppy_marth> gotta play this game for research purposes
[3:07:02] <HydroChu> theyre all 5000 years old
[3:07:02] <mr_slaide> Already read it. Have the old tv and new tv series.
[3:07:04] <Applecannon63> no sun wukong?
[3:07:07] <Guntanks_in_Space> but instead of mowing down dynasty warriors footsoldiers, you're all tiddy fighters
[3:07:13] <Applecannon63> or Zhu Bajie
[3:07:15] <Guntanks_in_Space> isn't Lu Bu weak to grapplers then
[3:07:23] <Guntanks_in_Space> especially ones with Ropes and Pillars
[3:07:30] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> not if he's Lube Buu
[3:07:31] <hntronium> This isn't journey to the west my man
[3:07:41] <Guntanks_in_Space> Lube Bu could have slipped away from that trap
[3:07:42] <mr_slaide> What hntronium said.
[3:07:51] <Applecannon63> ah
[3:08:18] <+parrotman01> You would play this game
[3:08:26] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I wouldn't
[3:08:51] <hntronium> But would you play the VN
[3:08:51] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[3:08:56] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I can barely care about Def Jam
[3:09:11] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> and I only care because of the SUPER MOVES
[3:09:13] <dero45> Is this just Sengoku basara with lolis
[3:09:25] <Guntanks_in_Space> more like Dynasty Warriors but Lolis
[3:09:37] <hntronium> Sengloli Bashota
[3:09:37] <mr_slaide> What Guntanks said.
[3:10:01] <Guntanks_in_Space> there was a Warring States but Lolis series though, but i forgot what that was called
[3:10:07] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Come on, Def Jam: World Under your Feet for PS5
[3:10:11] <mr_slaide> Series started as a hentai though.
[3:10:14] <dero45> But basara is anime dynasty warriors
[3:10:22] <hntronium> I don't remember lolis but Sengoku Rance is porn warring states
[3:10:27] <+doctor_piss_inspect> PogChamp
[3:10:35] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah i may have been thinking of Rance lol
[3:10:38] <MaxXtreme23> what the fuck did i walk into
[3:10:41] <mr_slaide> Not same era, not same country.
[3:10:52] <dero45> @mr_slaide I knew I recognized the art style
[3:10:56] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @MaxXtreme23 your jail cell, welcome
[3:10:59] <SilentRukei> Hey that's pretty good PogChamp
[3:11:01] <Huntercd> Should I be concerned that girl has a tiny skirt?
[3:11:03] <mr_slaide> @dero45 Pretty much.
[3:11:06] <DGZenos> LEWD
[3:11:14] <mr_slaide> We're alread ygoint to kail Huntercd.
[3:11:16] <Guntanks_in_Space> understandable
[3:11:16] <dero45> @maxxtreme23 Just take a seat right there
[3:11:16] <CalderGaming> you correct someone on sun wukong but mix up sengoku and three kingdoms Kappa
[3:11:21] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @Huntercd you should be concerned that you are concerened
[3:11:22] <mr_slaide> To jail.
[3:11:50] <alrobot2014> the question is whether we go before or after the outro for the stream
[3:12:03] <Guntanks_in_Space> it all depends on how fast the cops arrive
[3:12:08] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Do not PASS GO, do not collect $200
[3:12:42] <MaxXtreme23> are these sprites actually 3d models...?
[3:12:46] <Guntanks_in_Space> yes
[3:12:55] <SilentRukei> yep
[3:12:57] <+doctor_piss_inspect> thats pretty neat
[3:13:16] <hntronium> So I mixed up my porn, k
[3:13:27] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I think the streamers are also 3D models and impressive looking ones too
[3:13:36] <GreatestGuess> I feel like he’s making it harder by not doing the jump attacks
[3:13:59] <CopperTucker> I need several adults
[3:14:07] <mr_slaide> You love it.
[3:14:11] <hntronium> You have them on the screen in front of you
[3:14:23] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @CopperTucker I'll "come" help Kappa
[3:14:27] <CopperTucker> you've got me there
[3:14:29] <hntronium> They're here to introduce you to the wonderful world of porn about china
[3:14:49] <mr_slaide> Fair warning: Do NOT play the visual novel game.
[3:14:54] <Guntanks_in_Space> ^
[3:14:56] <MaxXtreme23> oh a little bar on the bottom for otg, wall bounce and ground bounce
[3:14:59] <MaxXtreme23> that's neat
[3:15:01] <hntronium> No, play it
[3:15:06] <hntronium> But make sure to delete it
[3:15:09] <mr_slaide> Don't play it, nerds!
[3:15:10] <+Austinck> what about dangangronpa
[3:15:17] <GreatestGuess> I should point out that it’s common for these combos to only happen about once in every 2 out of 3 set at higher levels, if even that
[3:15:20] <hntronium> Danganronpa isn't porn enough to count
[3:15:27] <mr_slaide> Dugengrampa is tame compared to this shit.
[3:15:33] <+KR_Black> sumimasen but ... nani the fuck is this ?
[3:15:34] <hntronium> Actually, don't play the game. Play the remake.
[3:15:48] <MaxXtreme23> what about eiyuu senki
[3:15:56] <hntronium> Play that too
[3:15:56] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[3:16:42] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> slam these tiny girls with your fists
[3:16:44] <mr_slaide> What are you talking about? RoTK was all about fighting lolis.
[3:16:49] <hntronium> They skipped it in history because they are filled with shame
[3:17:05] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> shame?
[3:17:08] <SilentRukei> @breakfast_megapowers Your jail cell awaits
[3:17:13] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> wats dat?
[3:17:15] <hntronium> Yes, shame
[3:17:17] <mr_slaide> DAMN

[3:17:19] <%Solidnick18> yooooooooo
[3:17:26] <hntronium> That thing you abandon when you play this game
[3:17:37] <%Solidnick18> that's horny
[3:17:38] <SilentRukei> OH NO
[3:17:43] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> good thing I'll never play this game
[3:17:51] <+doctor_piss_inspect> KappaHD
[3:17:55] <MaxXtreme23> why does it look like a teppen super
[3:17:56] <hntronium> You're right, you'll just play the VN
[3:18:03] <%Solidnick18> goddamn
[3:18:06] <hntronium> And then the FBI will kick your door down
[3:18:07] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> what's a VN
[3:18:13] <hntronium> Porn
[3:18:14] <MaxXtreme23> a bopk
[3:18:18] <goose_attack_almanac> Reggie's toes are WIGGLIN
[3:18:21] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> porn?
[3:18:24] <@Menitta> Visual novel
[3:18:25] <lilo52> smells like Liam Milk
[3:18:30] <katocrimson> cao cao is pleased with his legacy
[3:18:32] <hntronium> Yes, porn
[3:18:35] <SilentRukei> Thanks, I hate it. WutFace WutFace
[3:18:37] <+KR_Black> octoPath octoEtic
[3:18:45] <mr_slaide> Didn't Cao Cao had like 30+ children?
[3:19:01] <+Austinck> more animes need pizza boys
[3:19:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> I GOT REGGIE'S CHARACTER
[3:19:19] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> aren't visual novels just hentai?
[3:19:25] <mr_slaide> Basically, yes.
[3:19:28] <hntronium> Yes, they're porn
[3:19:30] <SilentRukei> I mean
[3:19:30] <mr_slaide> Depends which it is.
[3:19:31] <+knackirontarkus> not really
[3:19:36] <SilentRukei> Not inherently
[3:19:36] <hntronium> Much like manga and anime.
[3:19:39] <mr_slaide> Depends on the series.
[3:19:39] <hntronium> Its all porn
[3:19:41] <fluke_LKZ> No, dummy.
[3:19:44] <@Menitta> No not really. There's a lot of VNs that are ALSO porn
[3:19:48] <fluke_LKZ> Phoenix Wright is a visual novel.
[3:19:51] <@Menitta> Ace Attorney is technically a VN
[3:19:52] <hntronium> Even that thing that's not porn. Its porn
[3:19:54] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> manga and anime are also porn
[3:20:03] <@Menitta> so is Steins Gate and Danganronpa
[3:20:04] <+knackirontarkus> there’s a subgenre that is but a good amount of VNs aren’t
[3:20:08] <hntronium> What we're viewing this very moment is porn
[3:20:14] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> especially Oreimo
[3:20:16] <+Austinck> lets not forget doki doki
[3:20:21] <mr_slaide> Well... It's based on a porn'ish VN.
[3:20:21] <dero45> Porn is in the eye of the beholder
[3:20:25] <krksobk> imagine thinking vn=porn
[3:20:37] <mr_slaide> DDLC was kinda tame.
[3:20:37] <Guntanks_in_Space> BONG
[3:20:44] <+doctor_piss_inspect> looney toons SFX
[3:21:00] <hntronium> See that just now
[3:21:00] <MaxXtreme23> you know what though, i'm kind of pissed that this VN got a fighting game but the masterwork that is majikoi is left in the dust
[3:21:04] <hntronium> That was definitely porn
[3:21:36] <+Austinck> isn't fate a vn
[3:21:40] <MaxXtreme23> yes
[3:21:43] <hntronium> Yes, porn was a vn
[3:21:55] <MaxXtreme23> fate is mollusc porn, everyone knows this
[3:22:01] <sage2001> what the fuck game is this?
[3:22:05] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> at least trash shows like Trigun and Cowboy Bebop will never get real video games
[3:22:15] <mr_slaide> Gender bender RoTK fighter.
[3:22:24] <hntronium> As you all know, porn never gets video games until it does
[3:22:25] <zamzoph> FEET
[3:22:29] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> LUL
[3:22:29] <SilentRukei> ＹＥＥＳＨ
[3:22:31] <@Menitta> LUL
[3:22:34] <+TruSpindash> LUL
[3:22:34] <Guntanks_in_Space> oh god
[3:22:36] <+Austinck> wasn't there a bunch of canned cowboy beobop games
[3:22:37] <hntronium> Reggie showing off his foot fetish
[3:22:38] <MaxXtreme23> reggie getting excited
[3:22:44] <@SoushinSen> Reggie can't escape the foot.
[3:22:46] <ManOfReason> reggie's sole burns
[3:22:51] <mr_slaide> Somewhere, Clemps is spanking it.
[3:22:54] <alrobot2014> we need to pan the camera down to reggie's toes
[3:22:55] <+Austinck> Reggie is motivated by the feet
[3:23:03] <%CaptainPileDriver> FEET
[3:23:03] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:23:05] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Reggie is a man of Soles
[3:23:07] <%CaptainPileDriver> FUCKING FEET
[3:23:12] <sage2001> the lamest game i've ever seen lol
[3:23:12] <%CaptainPileDriver> GG
[3:23:16] <zamzoph> that character has a feet-based scene, doesn't she?
[3:23:23] <alrobot2014> yup
[3:23:25] <hntronium> Probably
[3:23:26] <Guntanks_in_Space> Reggie is sustained by Sole Food
[3:23:31] <%Wool> HI IT'S ME AGAIN
[3:23:31] <hntronium> I don't know yet
[3:23:35] <%Wool> I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PLAY THIS EITHER
[3:23:40] <hntronium> Hi Wool, you getting in here too
[3:23:43] <alrobot2014> have fun wool
[3:23:44] <SilentRukei> Thanks, I hate it! SwiftRage
[3:23:48] <hntronium> Oh damn Wool getting into the porn too
[3:23:51] <+Austinck> I hope reggie got a high score on wiki feet
[3:24:00] <+TruSpindash> Wool better win on my account SwiftRage
[3:24:08] <%Wool> shoutouts to the Austin FGC for loaning me their PSN accounts
[3:24:10] <hntronium> Do it for chat wool
[3:24:25] <hntronium> Strike down reggie with feet
[3:24:27] <mr_slaide> Do it, nerd.
[3:24:36] <@Menitta> It'll be really embarrassing if Wool loses on not his account
[3:24:37] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Reggie is known to only enjoy 1/3 of Tic-tac-toe
[3:24:47] <sage2001> oh i thought the game bugged out and repeated the same line lol
[3:25:06] <MaxXtreme23> what the fuck this music sounds like it's from ddr
[3:25:27] <hntronium> At least its not eurobeat
[3:25:41] <@Menitta> I wish it was eurobeat
[3:25:42] <GreatestGuess> The music in this game is from the same composer who does the YS games, iirc
[3:25:44] <mr_slaide> Reggie eats chocolate bars with a knife and fork.
[3:25:48] <SilentRukei> Almost sounds vaguely Kirby esque
[3:25:59] <hntronium> I don't know which side to root for. Which one is chat
[3:26:21] <MaxXtreme23> i root for the timer so it can end this match
[3:26:24] <hntronium> Is it the pervert or the pervert
[3:26:26] <mr_slaide> Woolie is green one.
[3:26:27] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I root for Jail to cleanse us of our sins
[3:26:32] <ActualNobody6400> Oh hey, I just read an article saying to play this to learn fighting games
[3:26:40] <SilentRukei> @breakfast_megapowers Amen
[3:27:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> hey, if you don't get to many people joining can i get a match against reggie?
[3:27:32] <MaxXtreme23> that depends, are you going to hit him with your feet?
[3:27:32] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus

[3:28:28] <+Austinck> beat up those FEET
[3:28:38] <hntronium> Don't worry wool
[3:28:44] <hntronium> You'll have your revenge next time
[3:28:45] <@Menitta> The streak is over
[3:28:47] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I worship the church of Jail-sus
[3:28:51] <%CaptainPileDriver> i'm sorry reggie's fetish had to be put on display by a little girl
[3:29:03] <+TruSpindash> Rip Wool
[3:29:21] <hntronium> Don't be sorry cap, Reggie loved it
[3:29:25] <Guntanks_in_Space> defeet
[3:29:32] <+Austinck> the best thing to do is to turn yourself in
[3:29:49] <%CaptainPileDriver> like, i really want to fight reggie but i don't want to take the room from someone else
[3:29:52] <mr_slaide> Lolis?
[3:29:52] <%KingLlama1> KingLlama1 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 7 month streak! Sup Woolz and team ... looking forward to that Bayo content, Platinum Games be best Games

[3:30:04] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[3:30:10] <hntronium> If we all turn ourselves in they can't arrest all of us at once
[3:30:28] <MaxXtreme23> did reggie mention why he's playing what appears to be one of the youngest looking characters
[3:30:33] <Kalinflip> what is this creepy animu bullshict ncssNapsThink
[3:30:36] <hntronium> He likes em young
[3:30:37] <@Menitta> Are you saying we should storm prison because they cant stop all of us?
[3:30:45] <hntronium> Not if we Naruto run
[3:30:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus soo, like, straight up, i want another match against reggie to give him a taste of daFEET
[3:30:49] <+Anonymasque> hiding from the sun
[3:30:56] <@Menitta> If we Naruto run we can outrun their bullets
[3:30:59] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> After the Lobby is OVA's
[3:31:00] <MaxXtreme23> the bathroom tournaments will live forever
[3:31:39] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> But Rob is a Zombie, what can he do?
[3:31:40] <hntronium> Woof
[3:31:42] <+doctor_piss_inspect> Didn't they use the Kirby song for like 5 years on YT?
[3:31:43] <CalderGaming> use that thing that paige sang that one time
[3:31:47] <zamzoph> Just dress as Professor K again and you can play Dragula
[3:31:52] <hntronium> That was absolute wreckage just now
[3:32:03] <%CaptainPileDriver> DP motion is a command grab
[3:32:03] <+Redpointshine> METH GATOES
[3:32:04] <alrobot2014> METHGATORS?
[3:32:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> do it reggie
[3:32:14] <ActualNobody6400> METH GATORS!
[3:32:21] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> but Platinum loses its luster sometimes
[3:32:25] <TigerClaws12> LUL
[3:32:35] <%CaptainPileDriver> DP motion is command grab
[3:32:38] <mr_slaide> Owned.
[3:32:51] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> uch...uch...TMNT...uch uch
[3:32:53] <hntronium> Damn this game looks great
[3:32:56] <%SilentRukei> SilentRukei subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:33:04] <hntronium> I'll play both this and the VN
[3:33:07] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> !uptime
[3:33:07] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 33 minutes
[3:33:17] <ECRead> that was Tennessee. Alabama had the meth squirrel named Deez Nuts
[3:33:20] <mr_slaide> For the love of god, do not play the visual novel.
[3:33:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> can i play again?
[3:33:28] <hntronium> You can't stop me
[3:33:32] <Huntercd> An apex predator on meth, what could go wrong?
[3:33:33] <mr_slaide> True.
[3:33:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> lol, there's only 2 lobbies
[3:33:37] <mr_slaide> Do it, nerd.
[3:33:37] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Can we play the Virtual Novel
[3:33:40] <hntronium> Only the police can stop me
[3:33:51] <hntronium> And they haven't caught on to me yet
[3:33:53] <@Menitta> Ladies and gentlemen...we got em
[3:33:59] <MaxXtreme23> if you hate that eyepatch, don't look at drakengard 3
[3:34:20] <%CaptainPileDriver> reggie she's only like, 15 you perv
[3:34:24] <%SilentRukei> A man of taste as always Reggie
[3:34:25] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> what does Drakengard have to do with a eyepatch
[3:34:30] <Nick_Degica> I've never played the VN, but I'll admit I've seen the CG from it from when we were getting ready for release and I was trying to figure out the IP.
[3:34:31] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Kappa
[3:34:41] <jasperkf> hurrah for sarashi
[3:34:58] <ECRead> love me some Daidouji
[3:35:22] <katocrimson> becos eyepatch is canon--xiahou dun
[3:35:41] <MaxXtreme23> oh god is that supposed to be xiahou dun?
[3:35:45] <mr_slaide> Yop.
[3:35:56] <MaxXtreme23> i feel disgust
[3:36:05] <MaxXtreme23> excuse me as i go find refuge in fate grand order
[3:36:06] <mr_slaide> Kakotun, that is.
[3:36:08] <%SilentRukei> Just imagine
[3:36:09] <hntronium> In case anyone wants to know, the VN this is based on is called Koihime†Musō
[3:36:32] <%SilentRukei> In an alternate timeline this game would be getting into EVI this year instead of UNIST
[3:36:33] <mr_slaide> That's correct, hntronium.
[3:36:37] <%SilentRukei> *EVI
[3:36:40] <%CaptainPileDriver> i love how the one time it's easy to get in the lobby is for this no people playing game
[3:36:44] <%SilentRukei> *EVO
[3:36:45] <GreatestGuess> Evi indeed
[3:36:45] <mr_slaide> They even made an anime, but it was far more tame than the VN.
[3:36:57] <%SilentRukei> Fug
[3:37:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> OKAY
[3:37:06] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[3:40:19] <chronoxgp> first time i've seen it
[3:40:21] <%BestTeaMaker> @WoolieVersus so the devs of this game made the previous iteration of this series, called Shin Koihime Musou
[3:40:26] <mr_slaide> I am actually surprised many people have this game.
[3:40:29] <%SilentRukei> @captainpiledriver Next paycheck my dude lmao
[3:40:30] <GreatestGuess> I think this game is honestly more popular on Steam
[3:40:31] <%jinking79> i'm not risking my ps4 today
[3:40:34] <%BestTeaMaker> and the previous game before that is the eroge that this fighting game is based on
[3:40:34] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> as someone who doesn't own this game I want to play
[3:40:36] <$Rezca> I own it on PC
[3:40:39] <+Smileyhat> Is there much of an online community for this game? I've thought about getting it but not much point if there's no one to play with.
[3:40:39] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's 20
[3:40:40] <TigerClaws12> OH fuck someone was actually jailed for lolicons LUL

[3:40:56] <%BestTeaMaker> i'm sure there is a discord for this game out there
[3:41:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> fuck it i guess
[3:41:05] <Nick_Degica> There is a discord for it.
[3:41:06] <%BestTeaMaker> but yeah, this game is literally based on porn

[3:44:27] <%ozzrabbit> Why does it feel like characters with Chinese dresses are made for the sole purpose of showing off panty shots every time they kick?
[3:44:27] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:44:44] <%CaptainPileDriver> PFFFFT

[3:45:55] <mr_slaide> I am actually amaze at the amount of games this series has.
[3:46:01] <Nick_Degica> You only jump when you have a plan. Then again, don't do ANYTHING in Koihime Enbu unless you have a plan.
[3:46:02] <%CaptainPileDriver> PFFFTT
[3:46:11] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> We get paid?
[3:46:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> I GET PAID more for taking out the trash at my work
[3:46:16] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's done
[3:46:18] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I thought we were FREE
[3:46:20] <alrobot2014> reggie's too expensive
[3:46:24] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus signup is over
[3:46:24] <%Solidnick18> someone gets paid

[3:46:54] <TigerClaws12> It's closed
[3:46:55] <%CaptainPileDriver> the numbers are posted
[3:46:56] <$Rezca> I thought it was over, someone tweeted the numbers
[3:46:57] <%ozzrabbit> @BestTeaMaker i kinda meant in general. It's also like that with girls in skirts, but the short Chinese dresses just seem more obvious.
[3:48:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> hey reggie, check your twitter
[3:48:41] <MaxXtreme23> basic combo
[3:48:45] <%SilentRukei> Ah another Reggie character

[3:48:59] <%NeroInfinite> feet
[3:49:01] <%Solidnick18> lol
[3:49:03] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's not a stream unless there's feet pics
[3:49:18] <Guntanks_in_Space> huh, this is the first time i'm seeing sun quan played here lol

[3:49:33] <$jobbedbone> Megumin lost her hat?
[3:49:36] <hntronium> Reggie you are already brainwashed
[3:49:39] <Guntanks_in_Space> or some shit
[3:49:41] <%SilentRukei> ｐａｔａｓ
[3:49:41] <hntronium> You just don't know it yet
[3:49:51] <%NeroInfinite> Reggie is hungry for toes
[3:50:08] <%CaptainPileDriver> if woolie hadn't outed you and you're weak denial that you don't like feet, this wouldn't be happening
[3:50:12] <Guntanks_in_Space> Kannei rather lol, also dem patas
[3:50:33] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> You know I was fine with Reggie being a foot fetishist but him making these foot jokes is NOT ok
[3:51:07] <Nick_Degica> Kakoen is my favorite character to play but she isn't very high tier list wise.
[3:51:15] <jasperkf> Bacho? Is that the Japanese name for Ma Chao
[3:51:17] <@Solidus_113> woolieMIRIN

[3:51:52] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[3:52:00] <+chrishnaw> Showing your gazongas also displays trust
[3:52:04] <MaxXtreme23> oh geez that's xiahou yuan
[3:52:08] <CalderGaming> @WoolieVersus it's like Woolie and Darlington kind of
[3:52:09] <oiseaublanc> fun
[3:52:28] <mr_slaide> Woolie, back then, people had familiar names and common names. It was disrespectful to use the familiar name if you weren't close to the person.
[3:52:29] <%galaxyswirl> @WoolieVersus its like fate and their titles, like how saber is king author
[3:52:47] <MaxXtreme23> king author, writer of many amazing books
[3:52:59] <jasperkf> Is best girl Guan Yu in this?
[3:53:06] <%galaxyswirl> okay fuck my mind auto corrected
[3:53:13] <%Solidnick18> Kreygasm
[3:53:14] <mr_slaide> As an example, Sun Ce's familiar name was Bo Fu.
[3:53:19] <mr_slaide> Guan Yu is in this.
[3:53:20] <+TruSpindash> Kreygasm
[3:53:21] <$Rezca> she bounces and sways

[3:54:07] <zamzoph> So... is eyepatch Xiahou Dun
[3:54:11] <mr_slaide> They have not used her yet. At least not for the last hour or so.
[3:54:12] <+chrishnaw> Zettai Ryouiki: The Video Game
[3:54:19] <$Rezca> I think the only one missing is Liu Bei himself
[3:54:21] <MaxXtreme23> right now it's xiahou dun vs. zhao yun
[3:54:33] <mr_slaide> Yeah, Liu Bei is not there.
[3:54:41] <%Solidnick18> caocao
[3:54:49] <mr_slaide> She's there.
[3:54:56] <mr_slaide> She's the one with the scythe.

[3:55:24] <jasperkf> Zhao Yun, is that the guy who Kongming trolled to death?
[3:55:35] <mr_slaide> Nah. You're thinking of Zhou Yu.
[3:55:39] <jasperkf> oh right
[3:55:47] <jasperkf> Zhao Yun Zilong
[3:55:49] <mr_slaide> And, historically, it never happened. ;)
[3:55:53] <MaxXtreme23> zhao yun is lthe big important guy from shu
[3:55:57] <%Solidnick18> sick
[3:56:01] <zamzoph> Surprise Punch Girl!
[3:56:07] <WarlockCoffee> squat queen
[3:56:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's easy to style on cardboard
[3:56:18] <MaxXtreme23> do you think this tiny girl also ate her own eye
[3:56:23] <%SilentRukei> I was expecting worse
[3:56:33] <mr_slaide> Nah. Also, historically, that did not happen too. :p
[3:56:45] <zamzoph> history is lame
[3:56:49] <MaxXtreme23> it's true
[3:56:50] <mr_slaide> I agree.
[3:56:54] <MaxXtreme23> lu bu was kind of a bitch in history
[3:56:55] <%SilentRukei> That was quite tame compared to extreme close up of feet
[3:57:01] <%CaptainPileDriver> night
[3:57:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> reggie, your dm's are cursed
[3:57:09] <%Solidnick18> goodnight

[3:57:23] <zamzoph> @WoolieVersus Does it make you want to check out the source material? Kappa
[3:57:27] <mr_slaide> Guan Yu was also an arrogant jerk.
[3:57:39] <%SilentRukei> So what's for next week?
[3:57:43] <%Solidnick18> sima yi FeelsGoodMan
[3:57:43] <MaxXtreme23> liu bei was also not as benevolent as we'd think
[3:57:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> can't wait to see the youtube upload

[3:58:13] <Hakuto1> cirCop what content?
[3:58:14] <mr_slaide> Yeah, Liu Bei was also kind of a jerk. BUT, he was also very downplayed historically. Many of his military achievements were attributed incorrectly to Kong Ming.
[3:58:19] <hntronium> I'll buy the VN too
[3:58:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> 0
[3:58:34] <$Rezca> Will you buy the bodypillows?

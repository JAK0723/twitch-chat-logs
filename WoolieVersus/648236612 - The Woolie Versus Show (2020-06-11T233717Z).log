She became the reason I played the game, but I quickly started dabbling in other characters. The shout out she got on the doc put a huge smile on my face. Thank you Esteban for the awesome documentary and thank you Woolie for the years of awesome content.

[0:54:07] <SuckPuppet> does PC let you turn off the obnoxious visual effects?

[0:58:40] <@Menitta> Wow that's several levels of Yomi
[0:58:50] <Irkallu> This game seems so sick. I hope it goes on sale soon
[0:58:56] <GeoffTheHero> it's on sale now!
[0:58:58] <GeoffTheHero> $10
[0:59:01] <+heyitsmevoodoo> yep!
[0:59:05] <Irkallu> YOOO.
[0:59:13] <WheelsFGC> This game can get DEEP
[0:59:14] <+Jaysky> cohhMoney
[0:59:15] <@Menitta> Like your opponent could be doing heavies but now its a gamble whether or not you're being baited into a counter breaker
[0:59:18] <Irkallu> Time to learn my 1st 2d fighting game
[0:59:18] <APB_Harleqyn> If hitting the mediums does a shadow counter though, how do you normally break mediums?
[0:59:19] <@Menitta> Thats insane
[0:59:19] <@Solidus_113> The terms fuck a lot of people up
[0:59:21] <sou1less_> always wanted to play KI but wasn't going to buy an xbox for one game, maybe when I get a pc I will
[0:59:27] <Lee_The_Limey> $10 this is a bargain , man
[0:59:36] <%fabulousgaybear> fabulousgaybear subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[0:59:37] <@Solidus_113> manuals and auto doubles glide off my smooth brain
[1:00:11] <+slayabee> Okay so auto doubles are automatic two hits
[1:00:36] <twoto858> When you press a single button after an opener/linker, you get an auto double
[1:00:37] <+ManOfReason> I think new players should just focus on doubles and linkers

[1:02:11] <+Bl1tz87> download the framedata from infil's site
[1:02:32] <DeathByPoke7> how do i do a double double animal style
[1:03:02] <BwdYeti> it does have to be heavy I think
[1:03:12] <+slayabee> It has to be heavy
[1:03:17] <%gamewarden92> Toast sandwich
[1:03:21] <+BubbaRands> just bread. no butter
[1:03:31] <BwdYeti> that means that you should get in the habit of pressing both heavies on every ender, just in case it's fake
[1:03:36] <BwdYeti> if it's real you don't have any penalty
[1:03:50] <%Josef_Stryker> So is this just gonna be a lab session and no actual matches?
[1:04:05] <@Menitta> I remember I was showing this game to a friend, and he said 'wow you don't even have to be good to be cool"
[1:04:24] <%0ctaeder> hey i recently picked up ki is there a decent place where i can start learning things about ki?
[1:04:24] <@Solidus_113> Also note that KI has auto combos
[1:04:35] <@Solidus_113> Auto combos are an option feature
[1:04:36] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[1:04:49] <Mr_Rakjo> @Menitta my fridn said something simillar its nice when you show somebody a fighting game and they have fun
[1:04:52] <+ManOfReason> There’s matches
[1:04:52] <+slayabee> Ah you're right Solidus
[1:04:52] <T_Sasquatch> Really wanted this game but its not on PlayStation .big disappointment
[1:05:04] <+slayabee> Optional feautures
[1:05:19] <Evendrag> whos the guest
[1:05:21] <+slayabee> @t_sasquatch it's on Steam
[1:05:28] <+slayabee> $10
[1:05:32] <Evendrag> should be in the title lol
[1:05:34] <@Solidus_113> the auto combos are really easy to break
[1:05:44] <T_Sasquatch> @slayabee only have a laptop LUL
[1:05:59] <%Pookiedaexzile> Low Poly mode engaged
[1:06:03] <arkv01> man I am super looking forward to EVO KI
[1:06:12] <%Pookiedaexzile> Make it look like the orginal
[1:06:21] <%SirGO0SE> Kappa
[1:07:22] <@Solidus_113> It's what I used against Woolie and Matt all those years ago when Tusk came out
[1:07:23] <drefizz> where my Rash mains at OSFrog
[1:08:02] <TacoTangler> I just got this game yesterday (first fighting game) and the autocombo system really helps me undertand what i should be trying to do
[1:08:06] <%DensityD> potential to fail
[1:08:26] <Irkallu> Should I get it on the Windows Store (which has me scarred because of PSO2) or Steam? Is there any difference? (Aside from there apparently being a free version on the windows store)
[1:08:39] <+TimeNinjaDG> i think steam only plays ranked with steam
[1:08:43] <+TimeNinjaDG> windows plays ranked with xbox
[1:08:47] <@Solidus_113> Only difference is ranked matches are locked with your platform
[1:08:49] <+TimeNinjaDG> but player match is eveything
[1:08:59] <+TheBesteban> Windows store allows crossplay in ranked. Steam has crossplay, but not ranked crossplay
[1:09:01] <+ManOfReason> Steam version can cross play only in non rank
[1:09:02] <@Solidus_113> if you never play ranked there's no problem
[1:09:40] <+ManOfReason> Steam also has better controller support
[1:09:49] <+tearfuldevil> i have steam and i guess ill pick up microsoft

[1:10:22] <Irkallu> Thanks guys!
[1:10:22] <BoneBagMel> killer instinct: you never stop playing actually
[1:10:50] <TacoTangler> yea, the windows version doesnt support my switch pro contoller ismply because its so old. luckily everyone has xbox remotes
[1:11:19] <@Solidus_113> Bitrate is going to shit SO BAD
[1:11:32] <+Carson_fgc> also frame advantage
[1:11:51] <Irkallu> I'm assuming the windows store version doesn't have natural DS4 support, and I'd have to use DS4Windows if I went that route?
[1:11:51] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:11:53] <DeebzNutz100> "Rare"
[1:12:03] <drefizz> my rash gets 9 bars
[1:12:06] <BwdYeti> his instinct also makes his frame data better, so basically he's more safe when he hits the opponent
[1:12:14] <nooky77> @Irkallu yes
[1:12:30] <+ricemanfour2o> He almost sound like doodSteve
[1:12:34] <drefizz> Who's talking to them? God?
[1:12:36] <SunsetJack> Jago's around the world gives him 15% instinct bar no?
[1:12:38] <Irkallu> @nooky77 Oof. Idk if I wanna deal with some of the controller latency problems that'd come with that.
[1:12:43] <+Carson_fgc> close medium kick jails into itself
[1:13:18] <+Carson_fgc> in instinct
[1:13:25] <DeebzNutz100> Extra Broken Vanilla flavor
[1:14:44] <SouljaGod420> added bonus of instinct is it resets your kv meter and makes all moves add 20% less to the limit
[1:14:54] <DeebzNutz100> one day ill have a good enough of to play KI.... one day
[1:15:16] <DeebzNutz100> pc*
[1:15:25] <london_flexing> same
[1:15:26] <BwdYeti> it's less worth it as an antiair
[1:15:37] <+kralec> Man I miss watching Killer Instinct. Need a new one. rooFeels
[1:15:46] <+ManOfReason> Kk has pretty good options for turning down the graphics
[1:15:48] <+Carson_fgc> you can run KI on a potato
[1:15:52] <+ManOfReason> Ki*
[1:16:14] <DeebzNutz100> my potato needs an update
[1:16:18] <Zombrocom> 161
[1:16:28] <+ManOfReason> LUL
[1:16:29] <+Carson_fgc> same
[1:16:32] <BwdYeti> you reset
[1:16:34] <Zombrocom> 231
[1:16:37] <BwdYeti> so the white life from the first combo was still there
[1:16:41] <+slayabee> There was grey life tho
[1:16:42] <SleepyMaribo> thats a meaty sandwich
[1:16:48] <+ricemanfour2o> doodmaxhype doodCrazy doodCrazy doodmaxhype
[1:16:53] <+slayabee> Grey life adds damage on top
[1:17:12] <BwdYeti> LUL
[1:17:26] <%gamewarden92> Sourdough is good fuck you.
[1:17:27] <+Loinclothiclese> garbage ass bread

[1:17:41] <+xeros720> what kind of shit sourdough you eating?
[1:17:41] <gekizenbu> people dont know about them sourdough starters
[1:17:42] <+leviting> dang Canadian sourdough must suck
[1:17:46] <+BingsAksolum> Did they cover shadow counters?
[1:17:47] <+jiggy_snipe> sourdough is fine
[1:17:48] <SouljaGod420> some characters dont get the level 5 damage and instead benefits from being able to cash out juggles
[1:17:52] <+ManOfReason> Bread war star now!!!
[1:17:55] <%illicitdonut> Sourdough is amazing
[1:18:04] <+Loinclothiclese> you people need to get with ROSEMARY FOCACCIA BREAD
[1:18:32] <DeebzNutz100> smammich
[1:18:44] <+Carson_fgc> @bingsaksolum yeah
[1:19:00] <+BingsAksolum> @Carson_fgc thanks
[1:19:00] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:19:01] <BwdYeti> like cinder fireball, kan ra tornado
[1:19:11] <BwdYeti> hit notstop, so you can mash the break
[1:19:33] <Franklin_Stine> I just got a miller light ad "Nothing better than a classic" Oh yeah nothing is more classic than water.
[1:19:42] <SouljaGod420> shadow linkers also dont add to the blow out limit so you can squeak in extra damage
[1:19:54] <DeebzNutz100> Kahn Ra shadow moves atpSpiner atpSpiner atpSpiner
[1:20:07] <+Carson_fgc> hit em with the one two fuck you
[1:20:51] <nooky77> how do you cancel the shadow linker ?
[1:20:55] <Franklin_Stine> @WoolieVersus I have one question ... On the defensive end.... How do you tell the attacks look the same to me at least
[1:21:20] <+Aeriqui> @Franklin_Stine time and practice
[1:21:20] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Drop it
[1:21:29] <+Aeriqui> but lights hit once, mediums hit twice, and heavy hits 3x
[1:21:40] <CalderGaming> !uptime
[1:21:41] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 21 minutes
[1:21:57] <%Pookiedaexzile> So you don't
[1:22:07] <SjoeB89> !uptime
[1:22:08] <+Bl1tz87> Speed, animation, and sound
[1:22:12] <%sonofthedeepsouth> woolieCHAN_TK Look at His dick!
[1:22:39] <SjoeB89> !help
[1:23:05] <+cubbywolf> woolie playing KI but there's no Max? damn you corona
[1:23:21] <%Pookiedaexzile> Yeah totally
[1:23:24] <357Sneak> Rich Homie QUAD
[1:23:51] <Franklin_Stine> Thank you @WoolieVersus
[1:24:03] <+Bl1tz87> Both auto double animations are similar to his normal equivalents.
[1:24:21] <%sonofthedeepsouth> woolieREGGIEFUL_UN woolieREGGIEFUL_FF
[1:24:26] <+Carson_fgc> its actually pretty necessary to look at your characters reel back if you wanna break arias kick linker
[1:24:29] <BwdYeti> they always just kind of teleport forward to make sure the combo works, so its based on what moves came before and etc
[1:24:32] <%sonofthedeepsouth> woolieREGGIEFUL_UN woolieREGGIEFUL_FF woolieREGGIEFUL_UN woolieREGGIEFUL_FF woolieREGGIEFUL_UN
[1:25:05] <+Yomigami> sugoiYu sugoiRi
[1:25:12] <+Carson_fgc> that's the only time I use that though
[1:25:23] <sackerkappa> Man... It's been a while since I've seen Jago's Voltron accesories.
[1:25:34] <APB_Harleqyn> So what is a 'manual'?
[1:25:37] <@Solidus_113> THE MADMAN'S BREAKING LIGHTS
[1:26:28] <BwdYeti> basically you aren't cancelling the move, you recover from one attack and then do one that's fast enough to hit them again
[1:26:28] <+Bl1tz87> Jump ins too
[1:26:28] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1270228062764969985
[1:26:32] <+Carson_fgc> you can link light manuel after a heavy auto double :)
[1:27:29] <+slayabee> Light linkers are usually 1 hit. Mediums are 2. Heavies are 3.
[1:27:38] <+Bl1tz87> Tell him to do a light
[1:27:47] <TacoTangler> i was just in the dojo trying to get manuals, them boys are tricky
[1:27:59] <%laserbeaming> some characters have special manuals. I think Riptor has them?
[1:28:10] <CalderGaming> spinal does
[1:28:10] <+Carson_fgc> @tacotangler cool name
[1:28:12] <+Taglog7> I just think of Rodney Mullen
[1:28:16] <+Bl1tz87> Jago too
[1:28:27] <BwdYeti> you don't need to do a heavy double
[1:28:49] <+slayabee> Heavy wind kick linker. Hold down the button after the auto double.
[1:29:10] <TacoTangler> Thanks @Carson_fgc
[1:29:30] <%NYCrownlessKing> i think its better to explain him a manual without using heavy linkers
[1:29:36] <%NYCrownlessKing> thats explaining two different mechanics together
[1:30:18] <henshin2289> Damage is also increased on manuals
[1:30:19] <+Carson_fgc> have him do a forward roundhouse> heavy laser sword opener
[1:30:22] <+slayabee> Just do mediums if you can Woolie. So Reggie can see.
[1:30:30] <+Carson_fgc> easier to manuel afterwords
[1:30:49] <Gieron667> i think ive heard "and ther's where the mind game is" being said like 6 times now
[1:31:22] <+lolnowdielater> who's in the call?
[1:31:39] <%NYCrownlessKing> some characters get auto manuals like Spinal
[1:31:51] <Hammatime8> @gieron667 Maybe the mind game is everywhere? Maybe the mind game is the friends we made along the way?
[1:32:07] <%Ecchigun> K
[1:32:08] <%Ecchigun> I
[1:32:30] <BwdYeti> do you have combo assist on?
[1:32:36] <+slayabee> Go light to medium to heavy
[1:32:38] <+Carson_fgc> cant with combo assist
[1:32:58] <@Menitta> Sadiraaaaa
[1:32:59] <%Pookiedaexzile> Hisako
[1:33:01] <%NYCrownlessKing> Woolie loves Makoto btw

[1:36:57] <+Carson_fgc> and his sound design is fantastic
[1:37:17] <%Pookiedaexzile> No no, They asked the chat for fun...but chose these characters for Glory
[1:37:23] <+Carson_fgc> I guess that could be said about every charater though
[1:37:41] <Franklin_Stine> I love that "MVC" captain america sheild strategy of gameplay
[1:37:55] <+Carson_fgc> fun fact there's a blind fulgore player that bodies people using just sound
[1:37:58] <%sonofthedeepsouth> woolieREGGIEFUL_FF Squid2 Squid3 Squid4 Oh no! The tentacles are coming for Gay Reggie!
[1:38:11] <+TheBesteban> Thanks @Carson_fgc!
[1:38:29] <+Carson_fgc> if that's not a testament to great sound design idk what is
[1:38:46] <+Hacerous> does it go away if shes hit?

[1:41:54] <%NYCrownlessKing> jaguar kick!
[1:42:00] <+Reaverund> Did he mention a wiki guide for this game?
[1:42:05] <%NYCrownlessKing> he did
[1:42:07] <%NYCrownlessKing> ki infil net
[1:42:19] <+Carson_fgc> ki dot infil dot net
[1:42:21] <+Reaverund> Thanks!
[1:42:22] <%NYCrownlessKing> dots for the spaces
[1:42:44] <+TheBesteban> Moobot will eat me if I try to link it again
[1:43:01] <+Hacerous> she also looses punches w/o daggers
[1:43:02] <$2j_hunter> 2j_hunter subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:43:07] <BwdYeti> and at some point you'll have your instinct to get them back, if nothing else
[1:43:42] <%NYCrownlessKing> also pressing PPP ontop of a dagger will pick it up, instead of rolling @WoolieVersus
[1:43:59] <+Carson_fgc> does she get her back fierce command normal if she doesn't have daggers?
[1:44:01] <%NYCrownlessKing> she also picks daggers up when doing her Tumble Kick special move @WoolieVersus
[1:44:08] <+Carson_fgc> I actually don't know
[1:44:13] <+Hacerous> i dont think she does
[1:44:16] <%NYCrownlessKing> tumble kick being Qcf kick
[1:44:28] <BwdYeti> if you're juggling them
[1:44:47] <Franklin_Stine> She just pounced on him like he hid icecream while she was sad lmao
[1:44:56] <+Hacerous> thats her Juggle cashout
[1:45:22] <+Infernull> I think it needs to have atleast one breakable hit
[1:45:22] <%NYCrownlessKing> have woolie test playing PPP ontop of a dagger? instead of rolling
[1:45:33] <mistersups> !uptime
[1:45:33] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 45 minutes
[1:45:45] <Franklin_Stine> Did this game finally come to playstation chat?
[1:45:46] <+Hacerous> you need to do teh heavy
[1:46:01] <sou1less_> this will never come to ps
[1:46:23] <nooky77> @Franklin_Stine no
[1:46:26] <BwdYeti> nice
[1:46:44] <Franklin_Stine> @sou1less_ Thank you. I remember growing up playing it on arcade and Nitendo. I was hoping this version came to PS
[1:46:45] <BaalsDepe> dat geof i hear? PogChamp
[1:46:47] <%NYCrownlessKing> have woolie test pressing PPP ontop of a dagger? instead of rolling. site says thats a pickup button.
[1:46:47] <BwdYeti> it's like kanji's air grab
[1:46:50] <GeoffTheHero> sup
[1:46:56] <+Hacerous> KI wont come to PS and all other japanese fighters wont come to Xbox
[1:47:08] <+Hacerous> i guess cept blazeblu
[1:47:11] <sou1less_> @franklin_stine yeah, I wish it did too but its microsoft
[1:47:21] <+Carson_fgc> @geoffthehero I like your cat
[1:48:06] <+Hacerous> she has good command normals
[1:48:06] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:48:10] <Franklin_Stine> @sou1less_ Got yeah. I didn't know if it was one of those things were they were like "Its been so long we need more money so its on more systems" kind of things.
[1:48:14] <+TheOneCalledRock> forward HK is a recapture
[1:48:30] <+Carson_fgc> brain expanding
[1:48:55] <Darkdrill> Yeah i made it to the love show
[1:49:00] <+Reaverund> Its weird, KI really feels "xboxy" to me. Like chunky and colorful. Weird how perception works.
[1:49:19] <Darkdrill> i cant wait to hear some music
[1:49:33] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> ^^^^
[1:49:37] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> We need some tunes
[1:49:37] <BwdYeti> that's a good point, should mention 6HK recapturing
[1:49:47] <+Hacerous> heavy command normals for pressure
[1:50:00] <%SirGO0SE> narmaya swing
[1:50:02] <+Carson_fgc> he probably doesn't have the training mode retro tracks yet
[1:50:02] <Franklin_Stine> @Reaverund I agree with that actually. If you played the "Real Steel" videogame. It looks like that. But doesn't play like a boxing game
[1:50:11] <+TheBesteban> God, Red Steel
[1:50:27] <+TheBesteban> I need another drink now
[1:50:33] <%NYCrownlessKing> you can cancel Far HP into her shadow dagger move to force them to block
[1:50:37] <+SinisterBroccoli> Maya is really weak to being shadow countered
[1:50:40] <%NYCrownlessKing> and avoid getting shadow countered
[1:50:53] <+Hacerous> its a good hit confirm
[1:51:03] <Franklin_Stine> @TheBesteban To be fair I said "REAL steel" not "RED" steel lol
[1:51:19] <+SinisterBroccoli> you can press down to pick up daggers without rolling
[1:51:20] <+TheBesteban> It was enough to give me disappointing flashbacks
[1:51:25] <+TheBesteban> And I'll never forgive you
[1:51:35] <+TheBesteban> PokCharizard
[1:51:49] <+TheOneCalledRock> real steel 2 was so much better
[1:51:52] <Franklin_Stine> @TheBesteban Then you activated my trap card lol
[1:51:53] <BaalsDepe> usually they juggle w/ tumblekicks iirc
[1:51:53] <+Hacerous> i think if she hits 3xK she can also pick them up
[1:52:00] <%NYCrownlessKing> tell him to try tapping all three punches instead of rolling on the dagger?
[1:52:01] <+Infernull> hit a normal in between?
[1:52:14] <%NYCrownlessKing> P+P+P
[1:52:25] <+Hacerous> 3 punches ? gotcha
[1:52:38] <+TheOneCalledRock> tumble kick also picks up daggers
[1:52:43] <+TheOneCalledRock> even shadow
[1:53:09] <%NYCrownlessKing> does Woolie know about "re-captures"
[1:53:09] <Darkdrill> nice
[1:53:11] <%NYCrownlessKing> ????
[1:53:25] <+humbelpie> how do you pronounce Folgore? is it FUL-GORE or FUL-GO-REY?
[1:53:26] <+TheOneCalledRock> the pips
[1:53:27] <+Hacerous> idk if he know she can recapture
[1:53:40] <%TheBesteban> Ful-Gore @humbelpie
[1:53:51] <%NYCrownlessKing> her axe-kick should recapture
[1:53:55] <+humbelpie> @TheBesteban i see, thanks for the info
[1:53:57] <+yourevilredux> think its one attack each per pip
[1:54:13] <+Carson_fgc> toasts on DansGame
[1:54:28] <%NYCrownlessKing> ayeee
[1:54:30] <BwdYeti> yeahhhhhh
[1:54:31] <%NYCrownlessKing> re-capture was the key
[1:54:34] <+TheOneCalledRock> yeah the more pips it is the more it attacks, which color matches which dagger and the number of hits
[1:54:54] <Franklin_Stine> Chat have they already covered cindr or glacius?
[1:55:06] <%Pookiedaexzile> Do a forward roll dagger throw cancel into cartwheel
[1:55:06] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1270228062764969985
[1:55:19] <ThatGuyThere03> Has Woolie decided on a soft main yet?

[1:55:38] <%laserbeaming> She's so stylish goddamn
[1:55:43] <BwdYeti> MrDestructoid
[1:55:43] <+Hacerous> does her Ex DP cash out juggles?
[1:55:57] <+TheOneCalledRock> uuuh
[1:56:00] <SouljaGod420> yes
[1:56:07] <%NYCrownlessKing> he's Nash @WoolieVersus
[1:56:08] <357Sneak> Sakumanator
[1:56:10] <%NYCrownlessKing> Kappa
[1:56:10] <BwdYeti> maybe turn off meter regen?
[1:56:13] <%NYCrownlessKing> SFV Nash
[1:56:21] <%Pookiedaexzile> He's Violent Ken with a teleport
[1:56:24] <@Solidus_113> the hype beam
[1:56:39] <+Carson_fgc> pfft charlie got nothing on fulgore

[1:56:44] <+Hacerous> doodGore doodBeamL doodBeam doodBeam doodBeam doodBeam
[1:56:50] <Gutsandlove> doodGore doodBeamL doodBeam doodBeam doodBeam doodBeam
[1:56:55] <BwdYeti> successful melee hits
[1:56:57] <%NYCrownlessKing> 4 pips = 1 shadow meter
[1:56:59] <+ManOfReason> God that sound is so satisfying
[1:57:22] <+Hacerous> try the heavy
[1:57:22] <mistermastergreg> t101WE t101HAVE
[1:57:26] <+Hacerous> its easier
[1:57:30] <%NYCrownlessKing> so it's kind of like fulgore technically has 2.2 shadow bars
[1:57:31] <+Infernull> any melee hits speed it up i think
[1:57:44] <+ricemanfour2o> doodGore doodBeamL doodBeam doodBeamR doodGood
[1:57:45] <BwdYeti> is combo assist messing it up again?
[1:57:51] <SouljaGod420> he cant because of combo assist
[1:57:59] <spawnzie> auto assist
[1:58:03] <%NYCrownlessKing> go to controller @WoolieVersus
[1:58:03] <+ShazBo2000> Fulgore!!!
[1:58:05] <Franklin_Stine> Oh geez I accidentally tagged woolie for no reason. stupid keyboard
[1:58:05] <%NYCrownlessKing> that may turn it off
[1:58:12] <%NYCrownlessKing> you can turn it off in the controller settings i think
[1:58:17] <+Hacerous> may-ya?
[1:58:20] <+TheOneCalledRock> i fucking HATE THAT
[1:58:20] <Who_lio42> its either or
[1:58:21] <BwdYeti> wow this announcer is wrong

[1:58:30] <+TheOneCalledRock> MEY YA
[1:58:32] <+SinisterBroccoli> Mayo nayse
[1:58:33] <%laserbeaming> press X to disable the auto assit
[1:58:34] <+Infernull> tele, lazer, fireball, getting knocked down, and stopping slow it down
[1:58:34] <BwdYeti> you don't have to exit training to turn off combo assist, just controller config from pause
[1:58:35] <+Hacerous> LUL
[1:58:38] <%NYCrownlessKing> think you can just go to "controller" in the start menu and turn it off @WoolieVersus
[1:58:39] <%HostilePoundcakes> LUL
[1:58:40] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:58:46] <+TheOneCalledRock> @vaporousTippler nope, changes with the announcer
[1:58:46] <%Pookiedaexzile> She got dat RE % costume
[1:58:48] <%NYCrownlessKing> oh yeah there too i guess
[1:58:52] <%Pookiedaexzile> RE 5
[1:58:52] <%Th3SmartAlec> Mayor?
[1:58:55] <+vaporousTippler> Oh was that it?
[1:58:58] <+TheOneCalledRock> ye
[1:58:58] <+Carson_fgc> you can turn it off in button config maybe?
[1:58:59] <Who_lio42> Set Combo assist to Custom for Ultras only, zero downside
[1:59:03] <SouljaGod420> i think you can still do combo traits but you have to hold down back or something
[1:59:03] <%laserbeaming> "Oh right, I didn't do this to change costumes" -- Woolie
[1:59:06] <%NYCrownlessKing> go to controller on the start menu @WoolieVersus ?
[1:59:10] <+TheOneCalledRock> they are using classic announcer
[1:59:10] <MKII> maya' of jungle town
[1:59:13] <+SinisterBroccoli> wait so combo assist just disables an entire mechanic with fulgore?
[1:59:25] <+TheOneCalledRock> new announcer says mai-ya
[1:59:32] <SouljaGod420> it does it for a few characters
[1:59:53] <SouljaGod420> jago omen shago sabrewulf and riptor
[1:59:59] <+Carson_fgc> classic announcer DansGame in game toasts DansGame level 4 cinematic ender DansGame
[2:00:03] <%NYCrownlessKing> 4
[2:00:15] <%NYCrownlessKing> 4 green = 1 shadow, 4 yellow = 2 shadow
[2:00:19] <BwdYeti> teleport
[2:00:22] <+TheOneCalledRock> in game toasts>
[2:00:27] <+TheOneCalledRock> in game toasts?
[2:00:30] <+Infernull> knockdowns
[2:01:05] <%DensityD> ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE
[2:01:10] <Franklin_Stine> @WoolieVersus I remember Max said the more agressive you fight the faster the wheel spins which means faster the meter burns so you get stronger lazers
[2:01:20] <%Pookiedaexzile> So we looking at Akuma with incentive to go in
[2:01:22] <%NYCrownlessKing> he can't cancel out of blocked Blade Dash, he can't cancel out of his Plasma Slice uppercut, and he specifically can't cancel an Energy Bolt fireball into Eye Laser
[2:01:23] <+Carson_fgc> the luttle messages that pop up every now and then that say "broke 25 combos" or whatever
[2:01:25] <+Infernull> i don't think you can do fire ball in to lazer
[2:01:26] <%Pookiedaexzile> and a lead in fireball
[2:01:26] <Who_lio42> only Shadow
[2:01:31] <+TheOneCalledRock> only shadow
[2:01:37] <+Carson_fgc> they are called "toasts" and they're thrash
[2:01:43] <+Hacerous> i think just upper body?
[2:01:43] <%DensityD> Yo what do you think of the NASA and SPACE X dragon capsule?
[2:01:45] <%NYCrownlessKing> he can spend one pip to cancel a non-Plasmaport special move into another special move
[2:02:08] <Who_lio42> light has use as a dp due to Priority system but ehh
[2:02:09] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[2:02:23] <+TheOneCalledRock> get fucked
[2:02:29] <Who_lio42> Just punish it, you dont have to counter it
[2:02:35] <BwdYeti> wow her shadow counter is the backwards one?
[2:02:41] <+Hacerous> wait
[2:02:46] <+Hacerous> does she not have invul?
[2:02:54] <%DensityD> frame 1 oof
[2:02:58] <+TheOneCalledRock> she does but it's SO small
[2:03:04] <+TheOneCalledRock> SO SO SMALL
[2:03:08] <%DensityD> baby small
[2:03:11] <+Hacerous> 1 FRAME?
[2:03:15] <+TheOneCalledRock> yep
[2:03:17] <%laserbeaming> the frames might kick in later?
[2:03:28] <+Hacerous> i guess because its a juggle?

[2:04:15] <+Hacerous> WOW

[2:04:18] <+Hacerous> ITS LIKE 1 FRAME

[2:04:45] <+ManOfReason> LUL

[2:05:12] <%DensityD> my pixelated Jpeggies
[2:05:16] <+nintega010> prepare to learn the most mentally taxing fighting game @woolieversus & reggie
[2:05:26] <%DensityD> Gore of Full
[2:05:27] <+TheOneCalledRock> @ballpatter same reason why most fighting gamed don't have rollback.... because fuck you OpieOP
[2:05:32] <@Solidus_113> reactor go SPEEEEEN
[2:05:33] <+TheOneCalledRock> games*
[2:05:36] <%Pookiedaexzile> You can't answer for my lack of self confidence
[2:06:02] <Who_lio42> dash throw is unreactable w full pips lol
[2:06:27] <%DensityD> PowerUpL MrDestructoid PowerUpR
[2:06:51] <SouljaGod420> it does not anymore
[2:06:56] <+TheOneCalledRock> it's so weird seeing classic maya without her club outfit because i always had that on
[2:06:58] <+Infernull> during instinct, you have to press heavys
[2:07:00] <+Hacerous> *shrugs*
[2:07:01] <%DensityD> intalls
[2:07:05] <Who_lio42> Fugs instinct prevents it from dropping iirc and cancels are free
[2:07:09] <%NYCrownlessKing> 4 pips = better forward walk speed, 8 pips = better back walk speed
[2:07:10] <SouljaGod420> free pip cancels
[2:07:20] <%NYCrownlessKing> full = both plus laser
[2:07:39] <Who_lio42> yeah its just free cancels
[2:07:45] <%laserbeaming> that's a good overheard
[2:07:50] <+Hacerous> combo trait
[2:07:52] <%laserbeaming> overheard*
[2:07:59] <ballpatter> As someone who is new to fighting games, would this be an optimal place to start?
[2:08:01] <+Hacerous> daggers in combo i think
[2:08:02] <+TheOneCalledRock> crouch mid p
[2:08:10] <Who_lio42> her combo trait is her dagger throw really
[2:08:12] <+TheOneCalledRock> you do two attacks
[2:08:13] <Franklin_Stine> Chat what is your favorite KI character? For me it was Cinder or Glacier. (It was a tie I like the elemental theme)
[2:08:17] <+nintega010> are they gonna go over all characters. cause all are unique in there own way
[2:08:21] <@Solidus_113> no
[2:08:24] <%DensityD> All I want to do, is see you turn into, a Giant Woman (Giant Woman) SingsNote
[2:08:27] <Who_lio42> since its a linker that has a TON of + frames
[2:08:28] <@Solidus_113> that would take more than all night
[2:08:32] <+Infernull> manual with daggers
[2:08:45] <+Hacerous> can you can roll into jump to close in on zoning
[2:08:46] <%laserbeaming> I'm a big fan of Spinal @Franklin_Stine
[2:08:55] <ManfredA> spinal or RAAM
[2:08:57] <+TheOneCalledRock> i think maya also has a double hit with heavy punch as well
[2:09:12] <+TheOneCalledRock> but yeah crouch mid punch is a really nice poke
[2:09:12] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:09:13] <%emperordread> Use the boost to get through
[2:09:32] <+Hacerous> what is fulgore bad it?
[2:09:43] <Who_lio42> hes bad at being bad
[2:09:43] <+Carson_fgc> being cute
[2:09:51] <+Infernull> sweep into juggle
[2:09:52] <+nintega010> Well atleast make sure to do Eydol, Gargos, & Raam
[2:09:54] <+Hacerous> LUL
[2:09:59] <%TheBesteban> Fulgore is tsundere
[2:10:03] <%NYCrownlessKing> his pip cancel, is also a natural way to anti air after a fireball
[2:10:08] <%NYCrownlessKing> because he can fireball , pip cancel dp
[2:10:11] <+TheOneCalledRock> arbiter is also fun to play ass
[2:10:23] <+TheOneCalledRock> as*
[2:10:40] <fenix1729> Enable combo state and attack data on options.
[2:11:05] <+Hacerous> remember fulgore vs spinal teleports always mix me up
[2:11:19] <%laserbeaming> that's a weird way of doing teleports
[2:11:42] <bevyrage> it's a thinking man's teleport
[2:11:43] <+Hacerous> do they know about the fight stick shortcuts?
[2:11:48] <+nintega010> boy y'all are gonna have headaches cause of all the information you need to acknowledge when playing a match. sooo fun
[2:11:50] <+Hacerous> or i guess its universal
[2:11:54] <+TheOneCalledRock> maya does not have a short cut because her dp is just QCB
[2:12:06] <%DensityD> Stitch is experiment 626
[2:12:18] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Hacerous
[2:12:21] <%NYCrownlessKing> oh Fulgore during instinct press HP+HK @WoolieVersus
[2:12:24] <%DensityD> Most important thing: just have fun!
[2:12:25] <%TheBesteban> Woo Moobot
[2:12:29] <%NYCrownlessKing> he can give himself a "Free pip"
[2:12:31] <%TheBesteban> Not playing around
[2:12:38] <Who_lio42> they went over the pip charge
[2:12:52] <%DensityD> they already discussed that, NYCrownlessKing
[2:13:01] <%DensityD> I don't know about the anti-air....
[2:13:05] <%NYCrownlessKing> i think they explained pip cancels..? but not that he can GIVE himself a pip? @DensityD
[2:13:14] <ManfredA> they did mention the charge
[2:13:20] <%NYCrownlessKing> they did? ah alright

[2:24:38] <+Infernull> throw more light and med dagger
[2:24:41] <+TheOneCalledRock> do not forget to throw daggers after DP
[2:24:42] <+Hacerous> the Canadian frame traps!
[2:25:15] <Who_lio42> 3P picks up the dagger at your feet
[2:25:18] <BwdYeti> let's see some air dagger tosses
[2:25:25] <+Infernull> maybe use heavy dagger less
[2:25:32] <BwdYeti> remember, you want him to block them to power them up
[2:25:54] <+Infernull> time for counter breakers
[2:26:06] <+Hacerous> roll , dagger, roll , dagger
[2:26:09] <%NYCrownlessKing> maybe tell woolie to think of throwing the fireballs as like cr.mk + fireball to put block pressure on the opponent to find the opening @WoolieVersus
[2:26:19] <%NYCrownlessKing> and then use the unblockable homing fireballs to create the settups

[2:27:45] <%NYCrownlessKing> think of dagger throwing woolie as you doing crouching medium kick into fireball @WoolieVersus cuz their down side for blocking is you get an unblockable approach later.

[2:31:44] <$legacy0117> Reggie still being sent back the Shadow Realm I see.
[2:31:57] <+nintega010> they didn't teach manuals right? those are hard
[2:31:57] <Lee_The_Limey> 'Xbox , no more runbacks"
[2:32:18] <@Solidus_113> OHHHHHHH
[2:32:25] <BwdYeti> PogChamp
[2:32:30] <TacoTangler> they were shown manuals, but i dont think they are actively trying to implement them
[2:32:30] <Picosunloaded> YOOO
[2:32:37] <killaholic89> reggies up four games and hes shadow realmed?
[2:32:40] <ManfredA> Reggie about to reveal his kekkai genkai
[2:32:42] <+Hacerous> you can also determine the strength of attacks in combos are is your character hit animation
[2:32:51] <+Hacerous> based on*
[2:33:53] <$legacy0117> Oh for real?
[2:34:08] <+Hacerous> yup
[2:34:09] <$legacy0117> Usually doesn't end that way.
[2:34:12] <+vaporousTippler> Easiest way to do it. Your animation never changes.
[2:34:15] <Toaster_Noodle> DP
[2:34:19] <$legacy0117> Huh.
[2:34:19] <+TheOneCalledRock> DAMN the DP
[2:34:43] <+Hacerous> does anyone remember if lvl 1 purple daggers destroy all projectiles ?
[2:35:02] <Who_lio42> it should yeah
[2:35:09] <%Pookiedaexzile> Yipes Voice: Uh oh ButtaFingaz Butta Fingaz. Empty handed in a knife fight, BUT FULGORES always scrrrrraaaaaaappped
[2:35:17] <%Arek_1> I only have a little more than a glancing knowledge of KI. Maya's flip kicks during her combos moves her backwards and drags them closer. That puts her back closer to a corner. Isn't that terrible?
[2:35:37] <Who_lio42> more jump dagger throw. more than more
[2:35:40] <BwdYeti> if her knife is behind her you might be able to pick it up
[2:35:49] <+Hacerous> i think its more for carry @Arek_1 when she loses daggers
[2:35:51] <BwdYeti> otherwise you have a forward tumble version
[2:35:51] <killaholic89> maya can go forward or backward I think so just got towards the daggers
[2:36:02] <ManfredA> I think RAAM would do Woolie wonders
[2:36:05] <$legacy0117> So this is Reggie's fighting game that he is good at. Cool.
[2:36:22] <killaholic89> does the flip auto pick up daggers?
[2:36:24] <Who_lio42> air dagger is the BEST jump in
[2:36:26] <ManfredA> part of it is that Woolie's having trouble adjusting to Maya's gameplan I think
[2:36:27] <+Hacerous> HISKAO!

[2:39:26] <killaholic89> sorry didn't read like one

[2:39:40] <+Hacerous> you're in here with him!
[2:39:43] <T_Sasquatch> Holy shit
[2:39:49] <%BisoromiBear> whapping stick
[2:39:50] <spawnzie> heAVY
[2:39:55] <Lee_The_Limey> Man that feels so unfair LUL
[2:40:04] <spawnzie> BIG STICK
[2:40:11] <ManfredA> it's not
[2:40:16] <+Hacerous> there is a range limit
[2:40:17] <ManfredA> Rash is absurd
[2:40:19] <+Hacerous> LUL
[2:40:19] <+vaporousTippler> Aganos feels like a boss fight. He's fair, but man it doesn't look like it.
[2:40:24] <spawnzie> every wall does more damage
[2:40:42] <%Pookiedaexzile> Oh he's number 28th on the Tier list fair
[2:40:55] <+Lord0Mugen> unless Letalis plays him
[2:40:57] <+Hacerous> back and HP with a club is faster
[2:41:00] <BwdYeti> if you chunk up with a club in your hand you put it back in you, which is faster than normal
[2:41:00] <+vaporousTippler> Yeah but he's still viable. Not like 28th in some games.
[2:41:00] <+Lord0Mugen> then hes top 3
[2:41:19] <+Infernull> reabsorb the rock
[2:41:22] <ManfredA> yeah KI has really solid balance
[2:41:31] <%SirGO0SE> hes like the big rock boy in fantasy strike a bit
[2:41:33] <ManfredA> there's a reason Max loves this game so much
[2:41:34] <%SirGO0SE> rook
[2:41:39] <+Lord0Mugen> some of the best balance around i would say
[2:41:53] <turf_wind_and_fire> What’s up chat? Sorry it’s been a minute since my last visit. Woolie labbing some KI?
[2:41:53] <+Hacerous> you can tell you ignore armor with the blue spark
[2:42:11] <+Infernull> hk wall bounces
[2:42:17] <+Lord0Mugen> if i remember correctly, Heavies ignore armor
[2:43:08] <XeroSigmaPrime> god i fucking LOVE THIS GAME
[2:43:09] <+Hacerous> yes they do, grounded heavies
[2:44:06] <%NYCrownlessKing> oh god its armored blanka WutFace
[2:44:07] <+Hacerous> throw with the club is like a rush punch that knocks through walls
[2:44:09] <TrashLeviathan> oh course hes blanka
[2:44:11] <%NYCrownlessKing> we found woolie's character
[2:44:43] <%Pookiedaexzile> I really hope Woolie falls in love with this character
[2:44:44] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:44:52] <%TheBesteban> I'm learning Hisako right now chat. Just for you
[2:45:18] <Who_lio42> Shadow roll recaptures
[2:45:31] <killaholic89> throw with the club is untechable?
[2:45:46] <+Hacerous> i think so
[2:45:52] <Who_lio42> yes
[2:46:02] <$legacy0117> Killer Instinct seems to have a lot of extreme ccharacter combat styles. It's pretty sweet.
[2:46:03] <+Hacerous> REALLY
[2:46:07] <+Hacerous> ITS A COMMAND GRAB
[2:46:13] <%Pookiedaexzile> @TheBesteban Thank you kindly for your service
[2:46:14] <+Hacerous> HOLY
[2:46:21] <Who_lio42> but it does a lot less damage but can go thru walls
[2:46:25] <+Hacerous> oh forward
[2:46:26] <+awesomeguy423> KI is without a fucking doubt the best fighting game of the 8th gen
[2:46:35] <BwdYeti> 30%, free
[2:46:37] <%Pookiedaexzile> Woah Woah woah woah
[2:46:50] <killaholic89> is that corner to corner?
[2:47:01] <%Pookiedaexzile> Have you played Fight of the Gods
[2:47:08] <+Infernull> you can stack 3 walls
[2:47:17] <+Hacerous> kinda
[2:47:18] <BwdYeti> yep
[2:47:22] <+Hacerous> close mp is an overhead
[2:47:27] <Who_lio42> aganos sweep is stupid good
[2:47:28] <+tearfuldevil> i'm reading the infil wiki and its character pages are great
[2:47:31] <+awesomeguy423> fight of gods sucks, fight of animals is where they really started taking things seriously
[2:47:32] <+Infernull> breaks projectiles
[2:47:39] <+tearfuldevil> Aganos - similar to: Charles Barkley's Monstars clone in Space Jam
[2:47:41] <+Hacerous> shadow ball also recaptures
[2:47:43] <+tearfuldevil> LUL
[2:47:47] <%Pookiedaexzile> Running around at the Speed of Ground
[2:48:02] <killaholic89> i'm trying to learn aria/mira and that ki wiki is fantastic
[2:48:10] <+awesomeguy423> Yo WHEN'S GET INTO FIGHTING GAMES: HOKUTO NO KEN
[2:48:28] <+Hacerous> is it foward HK?
[2:48:30] <@Solidus_113> eventually
[2:48:33] <+Infernull> standing hk is good
[2:48:38] <+Hacerous> you can chain
[2:48:50] <Who_lio42> low crush stomps
[2:48:52] <+Infernull> crouching*
[2:49:01] <%Pookiedaexzile> Somebody get abeat going
[2:49:03] <+Hacerous> yes
[2:49:10] <+awesomeguy423> fullscreen sweep
[2:49:11] <Adamotron> Oh dang, is that Geoff the Hero?
[2:49:14] <spawnzie> the RANGE
[2:49:25] <Adamotron> Awesome!
[2:49:52] <$legacy0117> That silly rock roll is obscenely strong for a projectile.
[2:49:54] <+awesomeguy423> Who would you guys say is Top 5 in KI
[2:49:56] <+Hacerous> i think the club destroy all projectiles
[2:50:00] <+Hacerous> when throw
[2:50:02] <+vaporousTippler> I don't think I've ever seen an Aganos mirror match. What even happens?
[2:50:03] <Who_lio42> armor is his best AA
[2:50:04] <+nintega010> yes
[2:50:29] <+Hacerous> shadow roll and jumping club are recaptures
[2:50:32] <$legacy0117> Golem battle of the Armor up variety.
[2:50:37] <ManfredA> my knowledge is severely outdated but I think RAAM and Rash are both top tier
[2:50:45] <killaholic89> aganos ignores aganos armor
[2:50:47] <Who_lio42> shadow Punch is hit/proj invul and shadow spin is throw invul
[2:50:57] <Who_lio42> 4
[2:50:58] <$legacy0117> Oohhh.
[2:50:58] <killaholic89> but they can use eachothers walls
[2:50:59] <xrosheart19> hey woolie i have a question for you
[2:51:00] <BwdYeti> everyone has a normal with 4 frames startup, hits on 5
[2:51:07] <BwdYeti> some dps are faster
[2:51:09] <%Pookiedaexzile> Raam is nerfed to 29th in the game
[2:51:20] <Who_lio42> TJ Combo gets 4f jabs in instinct
[2:51:39] <Who_lio42> stoopid
[2:51:46] <BwdYeti> you're too close, mon

[2:52:12] <$legacy0117> Those hurt boxes. x3
[2:52:29] <Who_lio42> Rash: haha HK go brrrr
[2:52:45] <xrosheart19> if you had to choose between a fridge or a modem which one would you choose?
[2:53:04] <sinsofchaos1232002899> have a amazing night
[2:53:23] <+Infernull> standing hk wallbounces
[2:53:29] <%Pookiedaexzile> When the person teaching starts laughing at the characters mechanics
[2:53:54] <BwdYeti> throw after wallbounce is always a good choice
[2:53:57] <BwdYeti> it does unscaled damage
[2:54:12] <@Solidus_113> Beerus before Beerus
[2:54:18] <$legacy0117> That Damage.
[2:54:22] <ManfredA> are you guys ready to see how stupid Rash is
[2:54:33] <BwdYeti> if you're full and they're far away, place a wall
[2:54:40] <BwdYeti> and they can't walk away anymore
[2:54:46] <+nintega010> we have to atleast teach them the 2 gods of the games Gargos & Eyedol
[2:55:03] <%Pookiedaexzile> And Omen iiiiiiissss 4 on the teir list....so good random fireballs der hm
[2:55:05] <%Pookiedaexzile> HM
[2:55:37] <killaholic89> dbfz style LLL
[2:55:54] <+vaporousTippler> I mean, I guess that's how Battletoads worked.
[2:57:35] <+TheOneCalledRock> argono's big stick is also a recapture if you hold heavy in the air
[2:58:07] <BwdYeti> medium kick
[2:58:14] <BwdYeti> hits both sides

[3:00:47] <Bryz0n> EX boot was more useful for a combo ender right?
[3:01:07] <$legacy0117> YOOOO
[3:01:43] <+BottledLineArt> The tongue can also eat the enemy projectiles, building shadow.
[3:02:32] <BwdYeti> PogChamp
[3:02:37] <$legacy0117> Nice

[3:03:43] <+ManOfReason> SPOILERS
[3:04:02] <Who_lio42> jMK is THE air button for rash
[3:04:37] <@Solidus_113> not quite band's dropkick
[3:05:18] <Who_lio42> it CAN cross up. I think they gotta be crouching
[3:05:27] <%NYCrownlessKing> oh btw forgot to mention Rash can boot juggle lol
[3:05:45] <%NYCrownlessKing> and i think what he was trying is instead of the axe kick after tongue it was the web feet move?
[3:06:08] <@Solidus_113> SourPls
[3:06:12] <357Sneak> SourPls
[3:06:13] <%NYCrownlessKing> think thats jump in HK?

[3:06:59] <+awesomeguy423> Is Maya an old character?
[3:07:04] <+vaporousTippler> She was in 2.
[3:07:06] <%TheBesteban> Maya is from KI 2
[3:07:07] <+awesomeguy423> ah
[3:07:14] <BwdYeti> she calls their names out on tossing them
[3:07:19] <Bryz0n> @awesomeguy423 she was introduced in KI2
[3:07:36] <ManfredA> let's go Reggie
[3:07:40] <+ManOfReason> esteban certified KI historian PogChamp
[3:07:52] <+tearfuldevil> cannot escape the Ki vortex
[3:07:55] <%NYCrownlessKing> im weird but even the SICKEST thing i find awesome in the game is
[3:07:59] <+tearfuldevil> its a true unblockable
[3:08:03] <%NYCrownlessKing> pausing it, and then moving up and down and hearing the music
[3:08:24] <%NYCrownlessKing> beats for every up or down input i do, that's just such a good non essential detail they added
[3:08:24] <+ManOfReason> UNGA BUNGA
[3:08:38] <Bryz0n> The chip
[3:08:44] <+vaporousTippler> This more or less is an end of level boss from Battletoads.
[3:09:01] <ManfredA> see
[3:09:10] <ManfredA> I knew Woolz just hadn't found his character yet
[3:09:48] <+ManOfReason> thats actually crazy
[3:09:49] <Gutsandlove> RELEASE THE UNCUT VERSION
[3:11:01] <+awesomeguy423> just play Omen like me
[3:11:06] <+awesomeguy423> do fireball horseshit
[3:11:12] <+awesomeguy423> and lightning legs
[3:11:17] <+vaporousTippler> 2 hits. 38%.
[3:11:49] <Bryz0n> @vaporoustippler he can kill if he gets 4 walls up
[3:11:52] <%SirGO0SE> nice commentary boys :)
[3:11:55] <+awesomeguy423> how the fuck is this game seven years old
[3:12:02] <+vaporousTippler> If he gets that many walls, he deserves to one-shot.
[3:12:09] <%FuqBoiSlim> Seven?! NotLikeThis
[3:12:21] <+ManOfReason> time files
[3:12:28] <+awesomeguy423> it sure as hell doesn't LOOK seven years old
[3:12:33] <+ManOfReason> flies*
[3:12:35] <+vaporousTippler> Every now and then I have to remember that the game is on PC. ...and I own it.
[3:12:48] <+awesomeguy423> this honestly looks better than most fighting games from the last five years
[3:13:14] <@Solidus_113> Woolie looking like a Timmy right now. Pressing the biggest buttons on the biggest boy
[3:13:27] <+awesomeguy423> I still wanna see Omen play HnK
[3:13:27] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:13:30] <+vaporousTippler> Timmy the Golem.
[3:13:37] <+awesomeguy423> Woolie, even LUL
[3:13:41] <+awesomeguy423> Omen on my mind from playing him
[3:13:45] <+awesomeguy423> guy's hella fun
[3:13:49] <MightySquirrel> yep. 7 years old with one of the best netcode
[3:14:01] <@Solidus_113> SPICY
[3:14:03] <BwdYeti> yoooooooo

[3:14:28] <357Sneak> BUSINESS
[3:14:29] <+vaporousTippler> Can't decide if it's the character or the stage that's giving Woolie this strength.
[3:14:31] <%SirGO0SE> LUL

[3:14:49] <Picosunloaded> fulgor time regie

[3:15:01] <BwdYeti> big timmy over here
[3:15:04] <%fangovafang> hes great
[3:15:32] <$legacy0117> Accidentttt!
[3:15:39] <$legacy0117> x3
[3:15:57] <+awesomeguy423> has this game gotten worse as time's gone on? in terms of balance changes
[3:16:02] <+awesomeguy423> I've had people tell me that
[3:16:20] <CryptusMaximus> This game is my favorite fighting game possibly of all time. It's also responsible for getting me into the scene, as it was my first entry into a tourney. Got second place.
[3:16:21] <%TheBesteban> A lot of season 2 players dislike season 3, but I think the game is fine
[3:16:29] <%TheBesteban> Every character can win
[3:16:36] <BoneBagMel> Can't say how much it has changed
[3:16:42] <BoneBagMel> but it has been a lot of fun playing it
[3:16:48] <Who_lio42> best thing to do when aganos does avalanche is run up throw
[3:17:01] <+Aeriqui> anyone who tells you season 3 is worse than season 1 or 3, they're wrong
[3:17:08] <+Aeriqui> season 3 is the best version of this game
[3:17:10] <BoneBagMel> season 3 was juggle season
[3:17:12] <Who_lio42> Season 1 was about FOOTSIES Kappa
[3:17:14] <Bryz0n> Not from what I’ve seen there are some hard counters but anyone can beat the other throughout the roster
[3:17:20] <+awesomeguy423> fuck footsies
[3:17:30] <+awesomeguy423> I'm so tired of this NOOTRAL and FOOTSIES meme
[3:17:45] <+ManOfReason> foozies
[3:17:49] <Who_lio42> jago shadow kick was PURE 80% screen plus on block footsies
[3:17:50] <BoneBagMel> Stagger = you can get grabbed, or get comboed
[3:17:59] <+nintega010> manuals. I don't know if you told them that yet
[3:18:03] <+awesomeguy423> I want degenerate setplay, rampant rushdown, and zoomer zoning to comeback
[3:18:13] <killaholic89> I love that the top 8s I've seen in this game have at least ten characters played
[3:18:16] <%TheBesteban> There are hard counters in a lot of fighting games though. Try to fight Blanka as T.Hawk in SFIV
[3:18:20] <sou1less_> ki is actually pretty heavy on footsies and neutral
[3:18:27] <%pyrotherian> Coming in late, why is a toad from Battletoads fighting a bionicle.
[3:18:28] <BoneBagMel> this game has everything btw
[3:18:37] <BoneBagMel> lol
[3:18:39] <BoneBagMel> bionicle
[3:18:40] <+awesomeguy423> this game has incredible balance
[3:18:45] <+awesomeguy423> and more importantly
[3:18:46] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[3:18:46] <+vaporousTippler> Aganos is a heavy who wants space. That's so weird.
[3:18:48] <+awesomeguy423> incredible character variety
[3:18:53] <BwdYeti> no air blocking and very little air options keeps you on the ground most of the time, so the neutral does have some footsies
[3:19:10] <+awesomeguy423> Roster homogenization is a massive fucking problem that is showing up in more and more fighting games
[3:19:21] <+awesomeguy423> it's so refreshing to have a new-ish game with so much variety in characters
[3:19:27] <@Solidus_113> OHHHHH
[3:19:31] <BoneBagMel> REGGIE WITH THE TECH!
[3:19:33] <BwdYeti> LUL
[3:19:40] <CryptusMaximus> Use Aganos as a fucking Umbrella LUL
[3:19:40] <%fangovafang> InuyoFace InuyoFace InuyoFace InuyoFace InuyoFace
[3:19:40] <$legacy0117> I'd get fighting games, but the road to mastery is so damn long.
[3:19:42] <WakeUpThrow> The BRAIN on Reggie, holy shit
[3:19:54] <+awesomeguy423> fighting games genuinely cause me stress
[3:19:59] <+awesomeguy423> which is why I hate that I enjoy them
[3:20:00] <sou1less_> you dont have to master them just have fun
[3:20:01] <+vaporousTippler> Fighting games are best played with buddies who are about as good as you.
[3:20:14] <+awesomeguy423> ngl I don't really find fighting games fun anymore
[3:20:15] <%SirGO0SE> woolieGLORY
[3:20:18] <Who_lio42> aganos can combo avalanche from some linker or something. forget what tho
[3:20:21] <$legacy0117> Got MUGEN, just cause you can slap together something you like to play.
[3:20:22] <+awesomeguy423> I play them more for the struggle
[3:20:35] <+nintega010> geof you play Gargos

[3:21:22] <Bryz0n> If these guys were to play SoulBruceLee they’d be steamrolled
[3:21:27] <$legacy0117> Although, figuring out how to balance it properly requires Coding knowledge. Oh snap the real fights begins now?
[3:21:38] <Itachihanh1> hope reggie wont get perfected again LUL

[3:22:47] <Gato_PaPoPe> aganos ultra??
[3:23:09] <Ieopard42069> they removed the gypsy card too just for the name alone
[3:23:09] <Who_lio42> Aganos Ultimate is prob one of the best
[3:23:13] <Itachihanh1> LUL
[3:23:13] <%SirGO0SE> i thought you were making a joke with the pro black, i was about to sayh thats like calling a box of crayolas racist
[3:23:21] <%SirGO0SE> but the images =x
[3:23:28] <$legacy0117> However, I did play a shite ton of Soul Caliber, and got to a skill a level where a could parry back and forth....And oh crap, yeah that is going on.
[3:23:31] <%R3Roundabout> SOMEBODY IS GETTING FUCKETH
[3:23:40] <+vaporousTippler> Oh god. Looking at these cards...they're not kidding.

[3:25:32] <%pyrotherian> Most of the cards are meh, the one I don't get being banned is Stone Throwing Devils.
[3:25:37] <%pyrotherian> Because it's literal devils
[3:25:40] <%pyrotherian> Throwing stuff
[3:25:41] <%HostilePoundcakes> Hisako PogChamp
[3:25:47] <@Solidus_113> skipping intros smh
[3:25:49] <Itachihanh1> hisako monkaS
[3:25:51] <%SirGO0SE> hisako theme so good f
[3:25:53] <+Mettic> the devils card is a kidna obsecure muslim slur
[3:25:56] <%FuqBoiSlim> I thinking stone throwing devils is a slur against muslims
[3:26:20] <%FuqBoiSlim> but it's like a something your grandad would call em.
[3:26:22] <BwdYeti> huh
[3:26:27] <zenith0111> Hitting armor means you never should have hit buttons or you didn't hit enough buttons lol
[3:26:34] <%pyrotherian> Hmm, agree with all the others but that one feels reaching.
[3:26:50] <$Kaiser_Loar> First I want to say that I play video games as an escape from reality. That said I want to say thank you an Pat on the Castel Super Beast pod cast for covering the protest. Your info was great to know. Also just because you play VG does not mean that you don't care about the important things. Thank you and tell Pat thank you as well.
[3:27:27] <$legacy0117> There is an animation required to add a layer of armor up.
[3:27:29] <BwdYeti> cmon stage ultra
[3:27:47] <%pyrotherian> Dang this game's pretty
[3:27:48] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[3:29:56] <+toolofparanoia> SSSSSSSUFFEEEEERRRRR
[3:30:20] <$legacy0117> I like the number of characters in this game....Besides Soul Caliber, I also played back in the day one of the Virtual Fighter games. Was good times.
[3:30:22] <+TheOneCalledRock> hot take: general Raam was imo the least hype character in the game for me
[3:30:24] <ManfredA> also just respect the fact this game has been doing crossplay for years
[3:30:25] <%pyrotherian> That stomp's nasty.
[3:30:29] <Itachihanh1> PogChamp
[3:30:33] <+TheOneCalledRock> he's still cool\

[3:31:43] <@Solidus_113> CAME IN JUST TO SEE HIM JOB
[3:31:46] <%pectusumbra> needed more rocks
[3:31:50] <WakeUpThrow> Woolie robbed himself NotLikeThis
[3:31:51] <$legacy0117> Soooo short ranged vs massive range.
[3:32:03] <zenith0111> Could've jabbed the fireballs NotLikeThis
[3:32:06] <+ManOfReason> tragic, you hate to see it happen NotLikeThis
[3:32:10] <Bryz0n> That shadow isn’t projectile invincible unfortunately
[3:32:19] <+cowkid222> who we got on guests chat? sounded like Steve?
[3:32:19] <CoffeeShopA> So glad Woolie is an Aganos main
[3:32:26] <+TheOneCalledRock> i don't know about winning evo, some of the killers in this game ARE FUCKING NUTS
[3:32:31] <+TheOneCalledRock> LIKE NUUUUUUTS
[3:32:32] <CoffeeShopA> There are dozens of us. DOZENS!
[3:32:47] <@Solidus_113> GeoffTheHero and Besteban
[3:33:04] <zenith0111> Woolie getting snuffed
[3:33:04] <+cowkid222> thank ya solidus
[3:33:29] <+TheOneCalledRock> oof the bitrate
[3:33:32] <+SinisterBroccoli> I think woolie's jumping to much
[3:33:34] <+TheOneCalledRock> jago is a bitrate killer
[3:33:46] <@Solidus_113> Keits is here watching you lose, Woolie
[3:33:48] <$legacy0117> This round he is, probably the Heavy Metal reminding him of DOOM Controls.
[3:33:50] <+SinisterBroccoli> aganos jump is garbo
[3:33:58] <sou1less_> not as bad as Raam, he's the worst for killing bitrate
[3:34:01] <zenith0111> That jump during the super fireballs was weird
[3:34:14] <%pectusumbra> gargos
[3:34:14] <%NYCrownlessKing> i definitely feel like Hisako would also be woolie's character.
[3:34:15] <blue6sub6remnant6> Gargos
[3:34:22] <BwdYeti> eyyyyyyy
[3:34:22] <%NYCrownlessKing> just cuz of his feel over Makoto
[3:34:23] <+TheOneCalledRock> dude i have a hard time with Raam fighting him in person
[3:34:25] <+nintega010> Reggie choose the new fulgore
[3:34:28] <+TheOneCalledRock> OH NO
[3:34:30] <%HostilePoundcakes> oh shit
[3:34:33] <+TheOneCalledRock> WELP
[3:34:33] <zenith0111> RAAM D:
[3:34:38] <$legacy0117> He needs a character that Rips and Tears.
[3:34:40] <BwdYeti> do the 0 frame startup instinct into command throw super
[3:34:41] <a_mad_dragon> is that a narn from babylon 5?
[3:34:42] <Bryz0n> Yeah Kryll Storm just annihilates bitrate
[3:34:49] <+TheOneCalledRock> HOPE CHAT LIKES PIXELS
[3:34:49] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:34:50] <DedlokPM> doodGore
[3:34:58] <+tearfuldevil> approach with kryll shield
[3:35:05] <zenith0111> Wtf LUL
[3:35:09] <CryptusMaximus> Shit, Reggie playin Fulgore? I knew he was the better Woolie Vs alum

[3:35:20] <%pyrotherian> Fulgore, haven't heard that name in a long long while.
[3:35:33] <zenith0111> Get em Reggie

[3:35:40] <Itachihanh1> LUL
[3:35:42] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[3:36:09] <+TheOneCalledRock> out of curiosity who asked for Raam? he is the last person I would expect in anything fighting game related?
[3:36:19] <+tearfuldevil> three punches brings up kryll hsield, which can absorb a projectile
[3:36:19] <@Solidus_113> Probably Microsoft
[3:36:27] <+tearfuldevil> and you can dash out of it
[3:36:31] <zenith0111> Yeah that's the Xbox deal I think
[3:36:37] <Bryz0n> Iirc Raam Omen and Aganos have sure kill combos if done right
[3:36:45] <+Aeriqui> he is literally sf4 zangief with FANG poison
[3:36:46] <357Sneak> lytKILLGOKU PowerUpR lytBODIED lytKILLGOKU FBBlock KAPOW khaSUCC
[3:36:49] <Itachihanh1> CMON REGGIE
[3:36:51] <+Aeriqui> like with fadc and everything
[3:36:51] <+Sulfur_Boride> I can't believe we got someone like RAAM and NEGAN in a fighting game before the likes of Kiryu and Majima.
[3:36:56] <$legacy0117> For real? RAMM? I remember that boss....Dang he is a throwback character.
[3:37:02] <+TheOneCalledRock> THE FAKE OUT
[3:37:10] <@Solidus_113> What other games were out with crossovers around KI Season 2?
[3:37:11] <+tearfuldevil> yeah I've been playing some raam and he's really lethal, but he has like negative zoning ability
[3:37:12] <@Solidus_113> MKX?
[3:37:25] <%pyrotherian> Oh man, Kiryu and Majima in a fighting game would be great
[3:37:31] <WakeUpThrow> Tekken 7 too, iirc
[3:37:35] <ManfredA> Gargos!
[3:37:39] <$legacy0117> The Swarrrrrrmmmmm
[3:37:39] <ManfredA> I wanna see him
[3:37:42] <zenith0111> @sulfur_boride Has there been any Sega guest characters?
[3:37:42] <+TheOneCalledRock> kiryu in tekken Kreygasm
[3:37:43] <+Aeriqui> kiryu and majima are most likely beign saved for virtua fighter
[3:37:48] <+tearfuldevil> @Solidus_113 i mean, marvel and DC had their heroes in fighting games for years, does that count?
[3:37:55] <@Solidus_113> no
[3:38:05] <+attackofthesage> @Aeriqui you're optimistic aren't you
[3:38:08] <+SinisterBroccoli> didn't the locust swarm look worse at first?

[3:39:54] <+TheOneCalledRock> surge means that shago can do specials twice right?
[3:39:56] <+superdoodguy> darksyE
[3:39:58] <+ManOfReason> YOU GONNA LEARN
[3:40:01] <BwdYeti> I think you have to combo into it
[3:40:08] <BwdYeti> to get the ultimate

[3:40:23] <@Solidus_113> Spinal!
[3:40:24] <+nintega010> default reggie
[3:40:28] <Bryz0n> Shago was QCF Grab?
[3:40:30] <Crusnik004> shago can always do specials the surge is like he shares meter cost with the opponent or some ish
[3:40:35] <zenith0111> Any Rash? PogChamp
[3:40:37] <Crusnik004> or like double specials
[3:40:41] <+awesomeguy423> like Shadow Jago's slide is usually crossup, but if you surge it will fake out and hit starting side
[3:40:49] <+awesomeguy423> air fireball shoots one angled
[3:40:59] <BwdYeti> surge is basically EX
[3:41:00] <%SirGO0SE> :O

[3:41:07] <+superdoodguy> More KI darksyE

[3:41:32] <+SinisterBroccoli> I was liking Riptor last time I played
[3:41:32] <+awesomeguy423> Reminder Omen gets THREE meter bars instead of two
[3:41:52] <@Solidus_113> These random stage picks are really letting us down. No Spinal, Glacius, or Hisako yet

[3:43:59] <ManfredA> ghost > jiangshi
[3:44:01] <+Sulfur_Boride> Guys, is Cinder hard to learn? I bought specifically him b/c I liked his character being a cheeky prick cracking shit-tier quips.
[3:44:07] <Crusnik004> also forced counterhits
[3:44:11] <+TheOneCalledRock> cinder is one of the hardest characters
[3:44:12] <+Sulfur_Boride> I think I understand what you're supposed to do with Cinder.
[3:44:24] <+awesomeguy423> Cinder is a charge character
[3:44:27] <+awesomeguy423> in this game
[3:44:30] <sou1less_> cinder is really hard from what I've heard
[3:44:33] <+awesomeguy423> charge characters are nightmares

[3:44:51] <blue6sub6remnant6> "She's also got the succ" - Woolie 2020
[3:44:52] <+awesomeguy423> in this game they
[3:44:55] <+awesomeguy423> they're really fucky
[3:44:55] <$legacy0117> Creepy jumpscare lady, walks so slowly, but moves around by attacking it looks like.
[3:44:58] <Crusnik004> charge characters arent like charge characters in this tho right? you just tap it
[3:45:02] <357Sneak> khaAYAYA
[3:45:07] <%NYCrownlessKing> ya she isn't a "charge" character.
[3:45:14] <+awesomeguy423> wait really?
[3:45:18] <%NYCrownlessKing> she can just charge her normals
[3:45:20] <+awesomeguy423> wow
[3:45:21] <TrashLeviathan> "give me a month" ok joseph joestar
[3:45:22] <%NYCrownlessKing> like holding a mega buster
[3:45:32] <+TheOneCalledRock> so that would mean riptor is a charge too right?

[3:47:05] <Iceboi_Patti> @Solidus_113 F
[3:47:29] <+TheOneCalledRock> hot take: spinals trailer is the best trailer in fighting game history
[3:47:41] <@Solidus_113> @awesomeguy423 relax, there's a massive list of games to play. HnK is on there. No need to scream "when is thing".
[3:47:52] <+awesomeguy423> alright BibleThump
[3:48:06] <hkgamingtv> when's HnK?
[3:48:09] <+Sulfur_Boride> @TheOneCalledRock Damn. Guess Max really knew what he was doing there, huh? It was Max who made that trailer, right?
[3:48:10] <Wofoeh> @solidus_113 except for MAHVEL
[3:48:16] <@Solidus_113> Marvel already happened
[3:48:18] <+awesomeguy423> I've been on wifi over quarantine, and I took the time to put a FUCKTON of time into HnK
[3:48:19] <@Solidus_113> it's on the channel
[3:48:22] <+TheOneCalledRock> @Sulfur_Boride yep!
[3:48:22] <Wofoeh> You always ask WHENS MAHVEL
[3:48:26] <$legacy0117> At least this isn't as complicated of a fighter as Big Band in Skullgirls.
[3:48:26] <Iceboi_Patti> okay but... whens HnK
[3:48:30] <Wofoeh> (I am saying it for the meme
[3:48:34] <%NYCrownlessKing> max did nearly every trailer @Sulfur_Boride
[3:48:37] <+awesomeguy423> btw HnK has semi-viable netplay now
[3:48:38] <sou1less_> yeah max did a lot of the trailers, spinal included
[3:48:41] <Flarepulse> but never "How's Mahvel"
[3:48:43] <%NYCrownlessKing> not all but alot
[3:48:49] <Admiral_PopnFresh> man Aganos is so friggen cool
[3:48:50] <+awesomeguy423> Mahvel's fine
[3:48:56] <+awesomeguy423> MvC4 is an inevitability at this point
[3:48:56] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1270228062764969985
[3:48:58] <Iceboi_Patti> How's Mahvel BibleThump
[3:49:02] <+SinisterBroccoli> So which PC version of this is best to get? Steam or MS?
[3:49:03] <+awesomeguy423> Mahvel is fine
[3:49:06] <Wofoeh> Most of season 2 onwards Max did
[3:49:14] <+awesomeguy423> @SinisterBroccoli depends, do you want to compete in EVO Online?
[3:49:14] <+vaporousTippler> Microsoft Store, oddly enough.
[3:49:15] <+attackofthesage> big body problems
[3:49:31] <Kitsunerasu> ms. if u get steam there's no cross-platform in ranked
[3:49:31] <+SinisterBroccoli> just to play casual really
[3:49:33] <Iceboi_Patti> 0/9 F
[3:49:34] <+vaporousTippler> In fact, if you get Game Pass on PC, you can play it for a buck.
[3:49:42] <+Sulfur_Boride> I really wanna see Nero in the next Mahvel so we can Buster the FUCK out of the opponent and use all his Devil Breakers.
[3:49:47] <+awesomeguy423> bro
[3:49:50] <$legacy0117> WAP GOES THE ROCK....NVM
[3:49:55] <+awesomeguy423> okay listen to me
[3:49:56] <Cpt_phantom> You’ve really gotta be knowledgeable and experienced with defence when playing Aganos
[3:50:00] <+awesomeguy423> give Nero the time stop devil breaker
[3:50:04] <357Sneak> khaLUL
[3:50:06] <+awesomeguy423> and let Jotaro counter timestop
[3:50:08] <+awesomeguy423> PogChamp
[3:50:09] <%NopeBadguy> A true Jedi would've taken the L's all on their own, Woolie
[3:50:10] <+TheOneCalledRock> i'd say MS is the best because it's crossplay with xbox steam and windows, steam is only crossplay in casual IIRC
[3:50:15] <%Binary_Fireball> what is this
[3:50:21] <sou1less_> I dont really think mvc4 even has a chance, but yeah I'd want Nero and Leon
[3:50:21] <Wofoeh> For the KI “experts” in chat, how hard would y’all rate Mira is to usev
[3:50:23] <Iceboi_Patti> @NopeBadguy LUL
[3:50:24] <+TheOneCalledRock> the windows version*
[3:50:36] <$legacy0117> Killer Instinct
[3:50:39] <+vaporousTippler> I could never use Mira for shit. But I'm no expert.
[3:50:39] <%SnackinOnChimps> Did i miss the stream?
[3:50:41] <+awesomeguy423> @sou1less_ bruh you know we gettin ANOTHER MvC cab right

[3:51:02] <Admiral_PopnFresh> because ROLLBACK
[3:51:10] <+TheOneCalledRock> maya is a bit rough, however she is not the hardest

[3:51:13] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 51 minutes
[3:51:19] <Iceboi_Patti> Maya is like, medium hard? I feel like I got her figured out pretty easily but there's like a skill ceiling I stayed far far below
[3:51:25] <+TheOneCalledRock> you have to basically learn item managment
[3:51:27] <sou1less_> @awesomeguy423 yeah I saw, I'd like for it to happen but I think it's a long shot
[3:51:36] <%SirGO0SE> woolieYE
[3:51:38] <Cpt_phantom> Mira spends life to get damage.’anyone will get wrecked in a minute using her wrong

[3:52:00] <357Sneak> lytGGS
[3:52:06] <+TheOneCalledRock> maya doesn't have as much tools as the other characterss but you can still do a lot with her
[3:52:17] <killaholic89> same
[3:52:23] <+TheOneCalledRock> she makes up for it with mobility and mix ups
[3:52:29] <Iceboi_Patti> She's pretty fun, honestly. The whole dagger mechanic is neat

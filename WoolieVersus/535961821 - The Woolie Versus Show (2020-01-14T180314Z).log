[0:21:24] <+ggbhtg> why?
[0:21:35] <+ggbhtg> it's just a little looky loo
[0:21:57] <+ggbhtg> Combo Breaker is good as AF, I've been twice

[0:23:40] <zayasu> LUL
[0:23:47] <+ggbhtg> There's a Culver's nearby, but that's all there was a couple years ago. Unless the mall that was shutting down a couple years ago has returned somehow
[0:23:49] <%Ayotocorp> Ayotocorp subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! Hey Woolz, any chance of you recording your reaction to the Smash direct since you'll probably miss the live broadcast (and you definitely won't be able to stream it)?
[0:24:04] <+locutus_of_the_porg> final fantasy 7 got delayed a month
[0:24:36] <tigerfang86> everyone's setting themselves up
[0:24:38] <Necnill> If it's Vergil
[0:24:45] <tigerfang86> I'd be happy if it is but I don't have my hopes up
[0:24:46] <Tracazoid> Everyone wants Dante and Bayo in the same game, though they might set themselves up for failure
[0:24:46] <Necnill> I will leap with joy
[0:24:49] <+locutus_of_the_porg> it's definitely Tony hawk
[0:24:50] <AMstone776> nah people think it's the girl from Pyuo Pyuo.
[0:24:51] <Solidnick18> they could stop
[0:24:56] <Louie_Salmon> But no, more
[0:25:01] <AMstone776> because of a hint.
[0:25:01] <mujahideenfruityrebels> Master Chieeeeef
[0:25:06] <+Gamefriendly> what? dont do that to me
[0:25:08] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> SORA PogChamp
[0:25:11] <+Lord_Scrublet> @ggbhtg best ramen in or out of the city is near teh venue for combo breaker as well as the best tabletop gaming store in the country
[0:25:12] <zaitje> Just put them all in there
[0:25:14] <SomersaultJustice> man I hope it's not dante
[0:25:20] <+Gamefriendly> i wish i didnt hear that
[0:25:22] <+ggbhtg> Galloping Ghost is a bit of a drive from where Combo Breaker takes place but it IS doable if you know a driver @woolieversus
[0:25:25] <Solidnick18> nintendo loves money
[0:25:37] <+Lord_Scrublet> i have lived in the area for almost my whole life
[0:25:40] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Its Travis Touchdown Kappa
[0:25:43] <+locutus_of_the_porg> frogger OSFrog
[0:25:54] <Poink1019> I'm not far from galloping ghost. it's a sweet spot
[0:25:55] <zayasu> bamco will probably continue it
[0:26:00] <Solidnick18> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli i'd be so happy man
[0:26:00] <Lionkevinson> Kiryu
[0:26:02] <AMstone776> nah just port and add more.
[0:26:05] <%theAncopro> I rmember thinking that at Brawl but yea this time the game seems pretty big lol
[0:26:09] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> or Francis York Morgan, people will be salt but i will be happy
[0:26:31] <+ggbhtg> @lord_scrublet it's been a couple years since I went, but I appreciate the strats
[0:26:32] <mujahideenfruityrebels> Goku. Donald Duck. Ben Shapiro.
[0:26:55] <Necnill> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli you put those words back in your mouth, don't speak that into existence xD
[0:26:59] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> real talk York would be the better pick than another sword character woolieSMUG
[0:27:00] <bellegrio> regardless pretty confident it's gonna be Geno for sure this time definitely
[0:27:18] <+locutus_of_the_porg> Steve from minecrap and Goku
[0:27:21] <tuesti> honestly love ur positivity woolie
[0:27:30] <+Lord_Scrublet> @ggbhtg the Ramen place is called Torizen and its japanese ex-pat run. The game store is called Games Plus. The US company that published Catan was started in their first location's basement. Also look up Mitsuwa
[0:27:30] <AMstone776> Geno has as much of a chance as Goku now.
[0:27:36] <zayasu> hisoka for smash :)
[0:27:36] <+ggbhtg> I didn't go to Ghost Arcade during Combo Breaker, short on time, but I did go in 2017 when Yo Videogames went there.
[0:27:37] <Solidnick18> yeah
[0:27:47] <saiyan24675> saiyan24675 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:27:51] <+locutus_of_the_porg> Sam Porter bridges for smash
[0:28:13] <bellegrio> what would be the one character that would piss you off
[0:28:26] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Lucas Kane for Smash
[0:28:27] <%theAncopro> dante and donte
[0:28:39] <+locutus_of_the_porg> kane and lynch for smash daveprBoomer
[0:28:40] <+ggbhtg> @lord_scrublet Torizen and Games Plus, huh? Any other keywords to remember?
[0:28:41] <AMstone776> I guarantee that the next one will get even more "WHOOOOO?" Than Hero, or Terry combined.
[0:28:42] <zayasu> @bellegrio geno LUL
[0:28:43] <%jinking79> Save the DMC 2 Costume smash be the only nice thing i want

[0:38:49] <zamzoph> building roads REALLY helps when you get the area on the network first so that you get other people contributing resources to the roads
[0:38:54] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> you can also just hoard the chirals on the preppers you have
[0:39:04] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> but thats pennies compared to this
[0:39:05] <NotHereToStream> shotgun with blood is usually enough
[0:39:17] <NotHereToStream> and if you don't have any weapon, call out for help
[0:40:08] <+Cymen90> Did Woolie cause a Voidout yet? I am not caught up

[0:46:37] <NotHereToStream> yo this mission
[0:46:39] <MichaelDood> This just in: Kojima announces Woolie as the ideal Death Stranding player. Kappa
[0:46:54] <QaizerArt> YEAH YEAH YEAH
[0:46:54] <+D00msDayDan> Oh no woolie fell into the same blood trap pat did, you need a lot more grenades than blood bags
[0:47:02] <Solidnick18> mount knot city...
[0:47:03] <QaizerArt> Absolute FUCK this delivery
[0:47:29] <+Cymen90> BOMB THE GHOSTS
[0:47:30] <QaizerArt> Especially before you get the highways built
[0:47:31] <zamzoph> just nuke it 4Head
[0:47:36] <%theAncopro> nukes are bad unless we use them
[0:47:38] <Poink1019> yeah grenades > blood packs
[0:47:50] <+Cymen90> This is like that Southpark episode where the US Army decides to NUKE IMAGINATIONLAND
[0:48:14] <+Cymen90> @theAncopro Literally America's political stance, tho
[0:48:32] <+domokun124> @d00msdaydan yeah I carry a crapnfon of grenades because they Re infinitely better in a fight

[0:49:21] <MichaelDood> No one better qualified than the expert of pissin n shittin, Sam Porter Bridges.
[0:49:23] <%JetpackMcQuack> 1 nice clean delivery coming right up
[0:49:26] <Anr1ck> bombs can also make, cuz you know its an antimatter bomb
[0:49:31] <+buffn99> I assume he means it'll trigger a voidout because of everyone dying from the bomb
[0:49:51] <+Cymen90> YEEES
[0:49:57] <+Cymen90> Can this actually fail?
[0:49:59] <QaizerArt> Like I said, I hated this delivery so much
[0:50:00] <QaizerArt> And yes
[0:50:12] <QaizerArt> I was walking to Mountain Knot City and tripped.
[0:50:14] <%JetpackMcQuack> Game save deleted LUL
[0:50:14] <%theAncopro> sir I've "delivered pizza i know what im doing"
[0:50:15] <Graxe_> Antimatter nuke
[0:50:15] <QaizerArt> Instant failure.
[0:50:22] <Solidnick18> oh no
[0:50:34] <jimmytwofeet> in the v-hickle
[0:50:36] <+FrostedZaibatsu> *trips over shoelaces *
[0:50:37] <+Cymen90> @QaizerArt Oh, so just game over, do again? I was hoping permanent consequences
[0:50:42] <DatAsuna> lmao
[0:50:52] <QaizerArt> @Cymen90 Well yeah just game over because well
[0:50:53] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:50:54] <QaizerArt> You nuke yourself
[0:51:01] <Solidnick18> a voidout is a game over
[0:51:07] <%blaggablag> I wish they let you voidout everywhere
[0:51:15] <QaizerArt> @blaggablag you can
[0:51:18] <+Cymen90> @QaizerArt That's kinda lame. I was hoping for more.
[0:51:21] <QaizerArt> It's a VERY bad idea
[0:51:27] <%blaggablag> No the voidout places are scripted
[0:51:33] <QaizerArt> Really? Damn
[0:51:34] <Solidnick18> i like this gold tho
[0:51:35] <QaizerArt> Wack
[0:51:38] <+buffn99> There's a way to have a permanent voidout
[0:51:42] <+Mkingston> Goldar is the last boss
[0:51:46] <peachy996> Goldmember
[0:51:49] <QaizerArt> Oh heck, how did Woolie get that gold bit on the backpack?
[0:51:51] <+buffn99> I think you have to die to a BT creature or something
[0:51:52] <NotHereToStream> John Goldman
[0:51:53] <MichaelDood> Figgggghting Goooooold
[0:51:57] <QaizerArt> The thing that wraps around your cargo
[0:52:03] <+Cymen90> BOOST
[0:52:03] <+Proxzo> Just ruckin this antimatter bomb
[0:52:35] <QaizerArt> Pfft, JUST sticky guns. Wait til he hits them up again. Demens gets fuckin BUSY
[0:52:54] <%blaggablag> ALso oh man if I didn't hate putting together this bit of highway
[0:52:58] <%blaggablag> it's the worst
[0:53:10] <QaizerArt> This is genuinely the worst, the one that goves over the river.
[0:53:31] <Solidnick18> oh you built the whole road?
[0:53:33] <QaizerArt> Oh yo he's got that fuckin watchtower and safe room too?
[0:53:40] <+LiteTheIronMan> I didn't wait to put it all together I ended up driving over most of the rocks and shit with the trike
[0:53:53] <Poink1019> Bola, then kicking the everloving shit out of them never gets old
[0:54:01] <QaizerArt> I had that in my game. The area he just passed with the safe room.
[0:54:07] <%blaggablag> THe point where you have to actively grind goon camps to farm shit it starts getting a bit frustrating. Which is saying something for this game.
[0:54:22] <nickthegurr67> nice otter fursona
[0:54:31] <QaizerArt> I wonder if REALLY popular safe rooms and stuff are in most people's games?
[0:54:33] <T_Sasquatch> This lp is still going on? LMAO
[0:54:47] <%theAncopro> tofu delivery
[0:55:02] <+Proxzo> Did you all see the Super Nintendo Land Commercial?
[0:55:03] <%blaggablag> anti matter dorifto
[0:55:04] <+Cymen90> @T_Sasquatch Thankfully, yea. Wish he had cancelled Indivisible tho LUL
[0:55:08] <+LiteTheIronMan> I haven't gone back to see everything since I finished my playthru but when I was playing barely anything had been finished
[0:55:10] <Poink1019> @qaizerart I think they are. I've seen safe houses with hundreds and hundreds of thousands of likes
[0:55:11] <jorniev> `WELCOME TO SILENT HILLS
[0:55:13] <%Swedish_Expert> jesus woolie built all the mountain knot roads already???
[0:55:19] <Solidnick18> this must have took a long time
[0:55:29] <+Proxzo> @WoolieVersus Super Nintendo World Commercial is up. It's a thing.
[0:55:33] <QaizerArt> @Poink1019 Yeah cause that safe room he passed had thousands of likes

[0:55:50] <QaizerArt> So maybe after you hit a certain amount they become popular enough to show up for most folk

[0:56:12] <nickthegurr67> @woolieversus did you knew that the art director of this game drew nicolas cage for a japanese magazine?
[0:56:13] <%theAncopro> lol ur gonna hear it for like 10 second
[0:56:14] <jorniev> i hope his next game is a horror game , and his next one is a mecha game
[0:56:15] <+Proxzo> this is some nice truckin
[0:56:26] <mikesapartment> how close is Woopie to supercell?

[0:57:34] <+Thatghostpepper> guys, did woolie have any plans to play SD Gundam: G Generation Cross Rays?

[0:57:43] <QaizerArt> yeyeye here it comes
[0:58:21] <%blaggablag> The fuck, Bridges?!
[0:58:21] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1214757122967318529?s=19
[0:58:42] <+LiteTheIronMan> man I went thru to mountain knot on foot
[0:58:51] <QaizerArt> @LiteTheIronMan
[0:58:55] <QaizerArt> It's the worst
[0:59:07] <+LiteTheIronMan> I didn't have the patience to pave everything
[0:59:19] <zamzoph> @LiteTheIronMan I think most people do. Woolie is just crazy to go and build the entire road from zero first
[0:59:23] <QaizerArt> Novelist's Son is the pain in the ass part of the highway to here
[0:59:32] <NotHereToStream> ok bitch, atleast sign this
[0:59:48] <+LiteTheIronMan> it'll make the mama escort way easier tho
[1:00:02] <jorniev> SO THERE ARE CODEC CALLS!
[1:00:02] <QaizerArt> shhh
[1:00:09] <Solidnick18> hey shhh
[1:00:18] <+FrostedZaibatsu> All you gotta do is kick that bomb just a bit. and she's gone
[1:00:23] <+Cymen90> @jorniev Where have you been?
[1:00:41] <jorniev> fine and you?
[1:00:44] <QaizerArt> @FrostedZaibatsu So is Sam, though.
[1:01:07] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Sam can come back though
[1:01:07] <Graxe_> Make America whole again
[1:01:08] <%blaggablag> Sam's tough, he'll brush it off
[1:01:14] <Novillion> whats with kojima and people nicknamed mama?
[1:01:17] <QaizerArt> Not if you get totally vaporized, bud
[1:01:18] <zamzoph> Not that I'm asking you to, buuuuuuuuuut......
[1:01:23] <T_Sasquatch> MAWA
[1:01:25] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Make America "a hole"
[1:01:28] <Solidnick18> LUL
[1:01:39] <+Cymen90> @jorniev I mean, the Codec Calls have been there since last year. If you are referring to Pat's "No Codec" statements, he means he wants to call people. In this game they only call you.
[1:01:40] <+LiteTheIronMan> kojima has a good relationship with his mom apparently
[1:01:45] <%blaggablag> "LADY I don't have TIME FOR THIS"
[1:01:49] <+domokun124> I thought anyone with dooms can come back. that's how fragile survived middle knot
[1:01:55] <Reizie_Etherealm> "Don't come back" but you just said you need the occasional delivery!
[1:02:00] <+LiteTheIronMan> not anyone just repatriates
[1:02:05] <AMstone776> eyyyy she gotta sister thou
[1:02:25] <kazataca> Fragile prob just teleported away
[1:02:25] <Graxe_> DOOMs lets you detect BTs and other special powers
[1:02:29] <+Cymen90> S O M
[1:02:31] <Graxe_> Repatriates can respawn
[1:02:42] <mikesapartment> dooms is just the ability to see bts and maybe control if your strong enough. Repatriates can come back to life
[1:02:46] <QaizerArt> And you'll learn more about repatriates later.
[1:02:54] <$cureneckbeard> do we ever find out what DOOMS stands for
[1:02:55] <+Cymen90> ü§î
[1:02:58] <QaizerArt> Though I'm pretty sure you need a body to come BACK to
[1:03:03] <QaizerArt> and if sam is nuked, well
[1:03:16] <+LiteTheIronMan> he can respawn after a voidout
[1:03:17] <%blaggablag> What with them being up to their crazy twin bullshit and all
[1:03:21] <+LiteTheIronMan> that happens in that first chapter
[1:03:26] <Graxe_> Yeah, Sam's lived through voidouts
[1:03:32] <Graxe_> Like in the beginning of the game
[1:03:36] <mikesapartment> Sam only voids out if his body is consumed by a bt
[1:03:37] <Solidnick18> huh
[1:03:53] <jorniev> check it out
[1:04:10] <QaizerArt> Nukes would totally vaporize what was left of him
[1:04:19] <QaizerArt> It's literally an anti-matter bomb
[1:04:24] <+LiteTheIronMan> voidouts already do that but he just comes back
[1:04:35] <QaizerArt> look man, i'm not a scientist
[1:04:41] <+Mkingston> Just use your feet, Woolie
[1:05:00] <Graxe_> Voidouts are already described as matter annihilation. Nukes are just super high energy explosions with radiation.
[1:05:01] <Solidnick18> the time snow
[1:05:27] <+Cymen90> ü§î
[1:05:28] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule

[1:07:06] <QaizerArt> Man this whole area was hell for me.
[1:07:59] <+Mkingston> It would be great if Woolie came across one of Pat's items and was like "naaah, fuck that!"
[1:08:16] <Poink1019> and piss on it
[1:08:17] <NotHereToStream> bruh i better get a fuckton of likes if i deliver here

[1:09:49] <jorniev> to the left
[1:09:53] <QaizerArt> Man, someone had a bridge to the right, made this a lot easier.
[1:09:53] <+Mkingston> It's fine
[1:10:24] <QaizerArt> Might need Mountain Knot first
[1:10:33] <tsnakesrule> Ba ba
[1:10:33] <+Mkingston> @QaizerArt that bridge was amazing
[1:10:35] <JayCue_yt> poop springs!

[1:38:56] <+Mkingston> Is there aging snow on his face?
[1:39:08] <QaizerArt> For those just getting to this area in your games, 5-star as FAST as possible
[1:39:16] <+thesw1tch> @mkingston you know it
[1:39:19] <Solidnick18> yep
[1:39:26] <%blaggablag> You should be able to set up half your way back in ziplines now
[1:39:26] <jorniev> this seems like the best part of this game to me... when the map just lights up with stuff from other people
[1:39:27] <QaizerArt> Like Irridium said it is the BEST skeleton
[1:39:34] <tsnakesrule> You will never use any other skeleton, or at least I just used this
[1:39:46] <+Mkingston> @tsnakesrule same
[1:39:48] <%blaggablag> literally run uphill on snow
[1:39:55] <QaizerArt> Speed skeleton is useful for a few things, @tsnakesrule
[1:40:10] <QaizerArt> (Like the goddamn South Knot pizza delivery)
[1:40:12] <worldbrand> speed skele is also super fun i wont lie
[1:40:20] <QaizerArt> go nyoom
[1:40:27] <%blaggablag> Speed skele is best way to entertain bb
[1:40:31] <NotHereToStream> speed skeleton is useful for one mission
[1:40:39] <NotHereToStream> for a certain pizza boi
[1:40:41] <tsnakesrule> Yeah I felt like a speed was usefull but didn't use 1
[1:41:01] <%blaggablag> admitedly it gets much more useful once you unlock the large batteries
[1:41:50] <+thesw1tch> lol i like how people get to 5 stars and it's like, well, looks like we're done delivering to you

[2:18:28] <+Mkingston> He's improved massively. So proud.
[2:18:37] <%Irridium> if you shout near the mules sam talks mad shit
[2:18:44] <Shishi1205> do they steal mama? lmao
[2:18:51] <QaizerArt> @ricluvno304 It's a really zen game. You can beat down some human enemies
[2:18:53] <Solidnick18> lol
[2:19:02] <QaizerArt> Killing is a very poor idea though

[2:19:30] <NotHereToStream> I remember if you keep calling shit out with mama on your back, she will think you're crazy
[2:19:36] <QaizerArt> Knock a dude out, steal his cargo in one hand and LAUNCH that shit at another dude
[2:19:38] <+Mkingston> You should take her to Lockne
[2:19:49] <QaizerArt> And yeah, she does, @NotHereToStream
[2:19:49] <Ashenik1> Woolie blink twice if you see this comment.

[2:53:20] <LocalRobyn> YOU'RE TOO CLOSE MAN
[2:53:32] <worldbrand> tbh it does a pretty great job of hammering home sams phobia and making it relatable
[2:53:34] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Did you like my movie? Shape of Water?
[2:53:38] <+Taglog7> That's a good movie
[2:53:41] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Del Toro would be GOAT
[2:54:07] <+Mkingston> No BB. Hard mode unlocked.
[2:54:10] <fruit_pie_the_magician> BBLESS deliveries fucko

[2:54:24] <jorniev> that was great
[2:54:31] <JayCue_yt> gonna need another couple beers after that one eh sam
[2:54:33] <worldbrand> I actually totally forgot i didnt have bb during this sequence and ran facefirst into a bt
[2:54:42] <krabsan> This chapter is the fucking worst
[2:54:45] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Drink to Forget
[2:54:54] <+Mkingston> I'm off for a shit
[2:54:55] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> No BB BibleThump
[2:54:57] <zamzoph> Nobody knew who Die-Hardman was until he put on the mask.
[2:55:00] <+Mkingston> Empty nest
[2:55:02] <%Irridium> I actually got super lucky with ziplines this chapter. Was able to just ignore all the BT's LUL
[2:55:09] <tsnakesrule> No mads
[2:55:15] <Shishi1205> means no radar
[2:55:16] <Graxe_> And no seeing BTs
[2:55:21] <zamzoph> ftw no Mads FeelsBadMan
[2:55:22] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I had to point black slay like five bts on the next missions as they were attacking me, keep those fucking grenados equipped
[2:55:25] <MayorRev> no BB means no defense against BTs
[2:55:25] <tsnakesrule> That should be a crime
[2:55:27] <jorniev> no bb means bts are gonna jump you
[2:55:31] <+FluffiTamamo> Guess you'll have to make another one. I mean locknes right over there...
[2:55:45] <gamewarden92> "Are you sure you don't want a iBB 5?."
[2:55:53] <Darkmega97> Is Dooms like the Shingles?
[2:55:55] <Graxe_> Gotta rely on Sam's shitty level 2 DOOMS
[2:56:12] <Graxe_> Compared to Higgs level 199 DOOMS
[2:56:16] <krabsan> No BB means you don't get to use your cool new cuffs which i think was a bad decision
[2:56:45] <+Black_Machete> you can still use it it's just hard
[2:56:46] <+FluffiTamamo> You still can cant you? Just have to feel around.
[2:57:19] <Graxe_> Can't see BTs so you can't see the cords
[2:57:33] <Graxe_> Gotta slash and pray
[2:57:35] <+Mkingston> good night
[2:57:46] <+MrRabbles> if some just keeps pissing the BTs will stay away

[3:16:20] <mrfreezepunsbestpuns> cheer1000 Watching the new salt party and I've gotta say I prefer watching/listening to the calm, nice, and "lets try and understand the other side of the argument" Woolie over the provocative salt party Woolie (both are entertaining), though of course Death-Cult-leader Woolie is the best.
[3:16:22] <Graxe_> Yeah, how are you gonna use your carriers on the zipline
[3:16:32] <Graxe_> They'll detach at the speed you're going
[3:16:53] <eljuanito1989> uhmm your packages are melting
[3:16:55] <Graxe_> BB being gone just means you can't detect BTs
[3:16:57] <Pappajimbo> sam can feel them cant see
[3:17:01] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> You can aim where you get off my where the camera is facing when you dismount
[3:17:04] <JayCue_yt> @mrfreezepunsbestpuns I don't see the pun in that post
[3:17:09] <%Irridium> remember in the cutscene with mama, when he disconnected BB and your scanner stopped picking up mama's BT
[3:17:45] <Graxe_> It's not cold enough to keep snow on the ground
[3:17:56] <Graxe_> At this part of the mountain
[3:18:01] <mrfreezepunsbestpuns> @JayCue_yt I don't do puns, I chose the name 5 ears ago when I just got done watching Batman & Robin
[3:18:08] <DaikiWithDaShot> @raaaaainmaker sometimes people put them in places where it's a cliff no matter where you face. Those are obviously the best ones

[3:23:06] <fruit_pie_the_magician> lol is he wearing the shoulder armor?
[3:23:29] <JayCue_yt> nice
[3:23:30] <%theAncopro> technically Sam Porter Bridges Strand
[3:23:32] <zayasu> PogChamp
[3:25:42] <%Irridium> oh this is gonna be good
[3:26:12] <+Proxzo> It's funny, when you're gun runs out of ammo you just throw it away and build a new one. Why not just build it more ammo.
[3:26:14] <JayCue_yt> Stay frosty, sam
[3:26:16] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I literally kept grenades in my hand the whole time here
[3:26:56] <Graxe_> Wait, is the reason why Timesnow is so bad is because it has to melt to release the time effect?
[3:27:16] <Graxe_> So things age faster with Timesnow?
[3:27:25] <Graxe_> Than Timefall
[3:27:32] <%Irridium> I'm shocked that thing came up with you
[3:31:03] <worldbrand> your post-apocalyptic pen pal

[3:39:52] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Where you face the camera when you reach the zip point is where you dismount, it isn't a locked dismount location
[3:39:55] <+linSP> usually i dont even get off these in between lifts so i put them at cliff edges
[3:40:05] <DaikiWithDaShot> @raaaaainmaker yeah
[3:40:06] <wandering_soul16> I can‚Äôt build something with pcc what is problem??my chiral bandwidth low. What is it??
[3:40:12] <+Cymen90> Why would you even drop?
[3:40:25] <DaikiWithDaShot> there isn't always another zipline
[3:41:33] <+linSP> get more stars and stay in the network @wandering_soul16
[3:42:40] <gamewarden92> Still only DOOMS level 2.

[3:58:57] <+Cymen90> GG
[3:59:03] <+laazybulbasaur> Lol
[3:59:17] <+Cymen90> Destroy it!
[3:59:22] <worldbrand> the only bad ziplines are the ones next to summits, the rest are a product of making do with what you got
[4:01:50] <jorniev> like PAT
[4:01:51] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:02:01] <Milo_Oda> everyone should be a snob about their lines
[4:02:23] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Has h deleted bridges, generators and postboxes for zipline bandwidth yet?
[4:02:24] <worldbrand> LUL
[4:02:28] <%Irridium> LUL
[4:03:04] <$laphyrion> I'm such a snob about my zipline network that I flat out don't incorporate other people's ziplines in my zipline network. xD
[4:06:17] <%Irridium> or they'll wonder why you put it here and not near the edge LUL
[4:06:25] <%wujak> id be mad it isnt higher up on that mountain, but its better than a lot ive seen
[4:06:39] <NotHereToStream> Hopefully it appears
[4:06:49] <+Cymen90> @Irridium Pretty much. Such a displeasing position....
[4:07:14] <Megagumballs> hey as long as it works
[4:08:00] <@Solidus_113> you have a memory chip too
[4:10:11] <+Cymen90> A lot of 3rd person games work REALLY well, actually.
[4:10:56] <+linSP> i wished vr with a gamepad worked
[4:11:24] <masterfire23> climbing actually works well with vr
[4:11:26] <+Cymen90> ...it does work with some games
[4:12:09] <+Cymen90> like that Southpark episode where the men have to look at doodle porn.

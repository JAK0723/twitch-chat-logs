[0:06:01] <%BisoromiBear> the manga has better pacing
[0:06:02] <+kekkerscrew> the manga is far ahead
[0:06:03] <ShawnEXE> The anime adaptation is perfect but there's pressure to release faster so the manga needs to be rushed a bit

[0:14:05] <C4m3r0n0409> EWW
[0:14:11] <%Wouldz> is a blood/peace pool overlay lossible
[0:14:12] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:14:24] <+kevlarkoala> Donating to the Peace Pool should be an AUTOMATIC ban
[0:14:25] <+azastyles> Finally a Woolie stream! First time here, long time fan! ♥️♥️
[0:14:27] <%Fujiwara_92> you how much is the bloodpool now?
[0:14:30] <@akuda_bar> @Wouldz that is smart
[0:14:31] <binkarus> I don't like information disappearing
[0:14:32] <%Fujiwara_92> *yo
[0:14:33] <%lewdskeletor13> This game will end with someone mysteriously disappearing
[0:14:38] <Diana869> we will have peace when only 1 is left standing
[0:14:43] <%lewdskeletor13> wooliePOYO
[0:14:43] <%arkv01> @binkarus cool, good to know we've got guys keeping backups in case
[0:14:44] <%Kriss1827> Whats up Fujiwara!
[0:14:47] <%Typhaeon> There will be peace in our time
[0:14:57] <binkarus> Always be prepared
[0:15:02] <+Dorf1> dark souls
[0:15:02] <%Wouldz> peace is war and war never ends
[0:15:05] <+Pookiedaexzile> Everyone calling me dumb doesn't realize that you can't walk into a TV studio and run a show on NBC, the lockdown on Big studios over small internet companiesl. So its gonna be ABC's Rooster Teeeth

[0:15:07] <+azastyles> milathElaHams miltiaCool
[0:15:08] <theturtlesnatcher> @binkarus and i appreciate people like you that archive things
[0:15:11] <Varadox> You already have Woolie. You played Black Mesa before you played HL1.
[0:15:12] <%Flamefish345> Flamefish345 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Gonna prime sub with Woolz for now until Pat stops playing FF7 and/or P5 Royal. P. S.: go Reggie go
[0:15:14] <%jiggy_snipe> yea you did Dark Souls 2 1st
[0:15:22] <%djazo> play the first one LUL
[0:15:23] <%Lion_kun> What about RE2 woolie
[0:15:28] <%Kriss1827> @fujiwara_92 hope youre well
[0:15:35] <Varadox> Also, RE2 and DaS2.
[0:15:38] <%Lion_kun> WHAT ABOUT DARK SOULS
[0:15:40] <%Fujiwara_92> imagine starting with ds2 Kappa
[0:15:54] <Malik1002> HOW DO I GET INTO KAMIN RIDER?
[0:16:03] <%lewdskeletor13> The Yakuza series is kind of the exception to that. Starting with 0 is the best option, and the Kiwami remakes supplant the need for the originals story wise. So chronological order works well instead of release order
[0:16:07] <%GenesisKnight> @Malik1002 Start with W or OOO
[0:16:07] <%Solracmoster2000> woolieS woolieT
[0:16:19] <%Fujiwara_92> @kriss1827 surviving, like one does in these days... hope you're well too
[0:16:21] <+tearknack> most people whose parents don't ccare, myself included saw star wars prequels first
[0:16:30] <Varadox> I still argue release order for Yakuza.
[0:16:33] <Varadox> So I hope you have a PS2.
[0:16:34] <+Aldesso> You also never played the first 100 Wonderful games. You started with 101

[0:16:37] <%INDECISIVEjew> yeah but then you have to figure out what to skip, so it's still a valid question. everyone sleeps on Metal Gear 1 and 2
[0:16:38] <Varadox> If you don't, then buy a PS2.
[0:16:38] <%Typhaeon> Zero makes Kiwami 1 really feel flawed
[0:16:53] <+gutlesscoward> I started the MGS series with MGS4
[0:16:57] <+tearknack> i've only played snake eatere and it was fine on its own
[0:16:58] <MattDemers> @Varadox PS2 Yakuza emulation isn't bad, and I really recommend playing it.
[0:16:59] <%Kriss1827> @fujiwara_92 Just at work like always, no quarantine for me :p
[0:17:03] <+Dr_DangerPhD> @Typhaeon Kiwami 1 if anything, is a massive improvement over the ps2 version as least
[0:17:07] <Diana869> what about series like FF or persona? that are numbered but really not connected ?
[0:17:10] <%Typhaeon> Undoubtedly
[0:17:11] <theturtlesnatcher> @gutlesscoward i started mgs with revengence
[0:17:12] <+tearknack> well, i did only play snake eater, now i've also played 5
[0:17:15] <Brandon__Brando> I played mgs chronology story wise I regret it but did it because had the Xbox hd remastered that didn't have mgs1
[0:17:16] <Dr00_PhD> The metal gear collection puts it in chronological order which is how i played it
[0:17:21] <%Javaa01> Kiwami 1 feels flawed because it's a very direct remake of Yakuza 1, and not really a re-imagining
[0:17:22] <Varadox> @MattDemers I still have my slim PS2 and beat Yakuza 1 and 2 on it.
[0:17:27] <+tearknack> @Diana869 that doesn't count unless your interested in gameplay progression
[0:17:30] <MattDemers> @Varadox Yeah, it isn't bad
[0:17:37] <%Typhaeon> You're going from a very refined entry in the series to a rework of the original that was still finding its legs
[0:17:41] <%Wouldz> I started mgs with 2, because BLOCKBUSTER VIDEO
[0:17:43] <%Fujiwara_92> @kriss1827 what work, if you don't mind?
[0:18:00] <%INDECISIVEjew> I listened to my friend in high school who had me start MGS with 3 and Resident Evil with 0.
[0:18:01] <+azastyles> azastyles subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:18:11] <%andrei11dr> Why does Woolie keep wearing stuff that looks like table cloth ?
[0:18:13] <%azastyles> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[0:18:14] <%INDECISIVEjew> we're not friends any more
[0:18:19] <+Pookiedaexzile> I perfer youtuve video on the badones
[0:18:31] <%djazo> yeah yakuza 0 is the start
[0:18:32] <%lewdskeletor13> I think chronological order for the Yakuza series works
[0:18:42] <%SchwaAkari> !uptime
[0:18:42] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 18 minutes and 44 seconds
[0:18:47] <%Javaa01> Zero is a better intro into the series then Yakuza 1/Kiwami 1
[0:18:49] <%SchwaAkari> Oh my god I finally caught one
[0:18:53] <%jiggy_snipe> what about Kiwami 1 then 0 then 2 3 so on?
[0:18:54] <%GenesisKnight> Yakuza 0 is built to be a starting point so I think that matters a lot
[0:18:58] <jbrowning134> I played crisis core before FF7 and it made FF7 so much better when I did play it
[0:18:58] <%Lion_kun> YESSSSSS
[0:19:05] <%Solidnick18> Yes
[0:19:08] <%Lion_kun> KIRYUS SUIT
[0:19:15] <%djazo> every yakuza game does that
[0:19:19] <%INDECISIVEjew> it does but it's just Easter eggs really
[0:19:26] <%Fujiwara_92> it does but nothing too bad
[0:19:27] <%SchwaAkari> Thank you to whomever gifted me a sub recently ♥
[0:19:28] <+Dr_DangerPhD> there's a couple moments like that but the game manages to be very self contained
[0:19:29] <%lewdskeletor13> Yes it does do that but it works as a prequel more than it does that
[0:19:30] <%Rhinoprotoss> Daigo?
[0:19:39] <nepwar> a major character gets way more detail and backstory that you would def would have cared about
[0:19:43] <%Javaa01> There are nods, but even without knowing the nods, you can totally follow what's happening
[0:19:47] <%plus_on_black> What's really really good?
[0:20:02] <%SirGO0SE> woolieCHAN woolieCHAN woolieCHAN
[0:20:04] <%SchwaAkari> SchwaAkari is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to WoolieVersus's community! They've gifted a total of 1 in the channel! 
[0:20:05] <%SchwaAkari> SchwaAkari is paying forward the Gift they got from Kazuhira_Boat to the community! 
[0:20:06] <%SchwaAkari> SchwaAkari gifted a Tier 1 sub to RacistWakka! 
[0:20:10] <+Pookiedaexzile> Yakuzo 0 "This Butler boy sure is calm"
[0:20:11] <Diana869> but what if its a mess?
[0:20:17] <%SchwaAkari> I will gladly pay that forward
[0:20:17] <%andrei11dr> Everything to do with Nishiki in 0 kinda doesn't feel the same if you never played 1
[0:20:19] <%Typhaeon> On-point gift sub
[0:20:38] <%optimasmaximas> not entirely accurate
[0:20:38] <alrobot2014> damn it Cartoon Network
[0:20:44] <%Kriss1827> @fujiwara_92 manager at a factory wont go into more detail thsn that :p
[0:20:49] <@akuda_bar> firefly was like that too
[0:20:51] <%lewdskeletor13> Yeah that’s fair. Star Wars website actually released an official list to watch stuff chronologically
[0:20:52] <%jiggy_snipe> I say Kiwami 1 1st then 0 because talk about how Kiwami feels weak compared to 0
[0:21:01] <$jobbedbone> 32 inch LCD TV 299
[0:21:01] <%Zerotoad5> Gundam Victory aired in wrong order
[0:21:01] <masterfire23> CN is so bad with that stuff
[0:21:04] <%Chatterbox1991> is Cartoon Network garbagem
[0:21:10] <%GenesisKnight> Danny Phantom did that. Danny suddenly had new powers because they skipped the episode where he discovered them
[0:21:12] <Diana869> i am not suppressed CN messed that up
[0:21:13] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:21:18] <+Dr_DangerPhD> I remember the clerks cartoon got fucked by being aired out of order
[0:21:20] <%lewdskeletor13> There’s also episodes from later seasons that take place before the first season intentionally
[0:21:23] <%Fujiwara_92> @kriss1827 that's fine, thanks for the answer tho, no worries... SeemsGood
[0:21:27] <+Pookiedaexzile> Eat up piggies
[0:21:29] <+Qsmash_> US got Dragonball Z before Dragonball
[0:21:34] <%INDECISIVEjew> I'm literally animating on a TV show right now where the studio just changed the episode order and moved some season 1 episodes to season 2
[0:21:36] <%FuqBoiSlim> I know there was a Transformers cartoon that got fucked over with out of order airing..
[0:21:38] <%Lion_kun> Is a Yakuza 0 lp a possibility?
[0:21:39] <nepwar> should revist old CN shows now that we're stuck home
[0:21:44] <%optimasmaximas> @WoolieVersus not true, see what @lewdskeletor13 said
[0:21:47] <%andrei11dr> Y watched Gundam in chronological order and oh boy, going from 0083 to Zeta was weird
[0:21:47] <BallerSwagBro9k> Fuck those people
[0:21:51] <@akuda_bar> @INDECISIVEjew damn

[0:30:51] <%lewdskeletor13> PogChamp500 as a huge Yakuza nerd, I agree with Minh, chronological order works really well for the series. 0 works as a good intro to the universe, and actually adds more emotional weight to the first game. The remakes of 1 and 2 also retroactively reference 0, so it makes it more cohesive. My two cents, keep being cool y’all

[0:39:17] <%andrei11dr> "If the food is shit, i stuff the bill"-Jotaro Kujo
[0:39:24] <%lewdskeletor13> I always leave the same tip because I’ve worked that job and I know what a bitch it can be

[0:39:59] <%derap41> What stereotype?
[0:39:59] <+hoenhime344> ive been a pizza delivery boy in upstate ny. usually they just tip 2 dollars
[0:40:01] <PeteyMcPickle> is there a stereotype that black people don't tip or something?
[0:40:03] <DaBigVitus> tipping is north american nonsense! pay a fair wage!
[0:40:04] <%Livelinne> woolieCHAN woolieCHAN woolieCHAN

[0:40:19] <+hoenhime344> i tip the 15
[0:40:21] <%Fujiwara_92> modern day heroes
[0:40:24] <Hopit> I live in a country where there's no tip culture (if anything, giving tips would seem borderline rude) listening to people talk about tipping is weird
[0:40:24] <+hoenhime344> but not like the extra
[0:40:25] <Oxybe> 10% tip normally, 15% for exceptional. none if shitty or no service.
[0:40:25] <%chiluzza> if im picking it up then no
[0:40:28] <%Exiliator> give them fair wage already
[0:40:30] <%lewdskeletor13> @dabigvitus I agree, but until that happens I’ll keep tipping
[0:40:31] <+Kamennoo> @Joelexion youre
[0:40:32] <%Jetzord> @paladinstarbuster technically they aren't
[0:40:33] <BallerSwagBro9k> No
[0:40:35] <DonatelloJose> Good guy woolie. restaurant and retail don't make even close to enough.
[0:40:37] <+linSP> he still gives 10 times the tips you do “10 times 0 is still 0”
[0:40:39] <%Exiliator> tipping is bull
[0:40:40] <PeteyMcPickle> that's a weird ass stereotype
[0:40:41] <+hoenhime344> pick up i do not tip
[0:40:46] <+Dr_DangerPhD> If I like the place a lot then yes, I always tip my local chinese place
[0:40:48] <%Nanani1990> you shouldn't tip for fast food or pick up, that's just ridiculous
[0:40:48] <+hoenhime344> im indian. and stingey
[0:40:52] <%Livelinne> Porters are badasses
[0:40:57] <%arkv01> all you lads flexing your tips, I don't even eat out LUL
[0:40:58] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I don't tend to if I pick up myself

[0:41:08] <%lewdskeletor13> Would you tip Sam Porter Bridges?
[0:41:08] <+paladinstarbuster> @Jetzord but we all know people expect it to be
[0:41:10] <%derap41> Tipping culture is so fucked
[0:41:12] <Chipshandon12> you only tip on pick up if you order there immediately so they make it good
[0:41:13] <%Superbro64> Who get's the money if you tip a pick up? They pay waiters with that?
[0:41:16] <Shishi1205> No tipping
[0:41:16] <CookieDoughFK> Glad I live in a Country without tipping
[0:41:17] <%yeetdabsenpai69> tipping culture is so weird to me
[0:41:17] <BallerSwagBro9k> @arkv01 The true power move LUL
[0:41:17] <%jiggy_snipe> like asking for donations at the register
[0:41:20] <Mr_Ease> If I pickup I do 10% if I dine in or get delivery I do 15%
[0:41:21] <%Superbro64> legitimate question
[0:41:23] <%derap41> Pretty muhc all of europe outside of bars
[0:41:27] <%saltpiggu> Woolie "I can't read a poem but I'lll spend 15 minutes talking about tips"
[0:41:27] <Guyver85> damn! is that Afroman?
[0:41:28] <%MyNameIsRasus> Brazil you don't tip
[0:41:28] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> over here you don't tip, it's great
[0:41:33] <%Exiliator> Tons of europe
[0:41:33] <PeteyMcPickle> tipping isn't a big deal here in the uk
[0:41:34] <Shishi1205> France is strange because EU doesnt include them
[0:41:34] <+Ether101_Prime> Everyone go check out Johnny's art in the artbook!
[0:41:38] <Oxybe> tipping culture sucks.
[0:41:39] <theturtlesnatcher> before the pandemic i was living off of tips as a server
[0:41:39] <%Fujiwara_92> yeah, you rarely tip in brazil
[0:41:41] <%lewdskeletor13> Well because other countries pay them a good wage LUL
[0:41:42] <%The_Timo> Tipping is a very North american thing
[0:41:45] <%Picia000123> Like, the pay for service is included with the dishes
[0:41:45] <Shishi1205> Tipping is always voluntary
[0:41:46] <Quigsies> Tipping sucks ass
[0:41:51] <nepwar> most SEA countries just have service charge or VAT added in no
[0:41:54] <+MrAtheGreat> Why is japan offended if you tip?
[0:41:54] <Quigsies> Like, pay your workers
[0:41:56] <+Pookiedaexzile> Its almost like you should pay Service people a living wage

[0:42:05] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @PeteyMcPickle
[0:42:05] <Oxybe> tips should be to encourage better service, nit enure a livable wage.
[0:42:05] <BallerSwagBro9k> Tipping is demeaning imo
[0:42:08] <%derap41> Do black people not tip?
[0:42:08] <flyingtentaclemonster> service should be paid not force to beg the guests for their salary

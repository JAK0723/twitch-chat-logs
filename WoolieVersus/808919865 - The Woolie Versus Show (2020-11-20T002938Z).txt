[0:04:18] <+gaemjurnalist> yessss gundam wing lets gooooooo
[0:04:19] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Man this kinda feels bitter sweet
[0:04:20] <+Fenrein> Nintendo's never done anything good for us and should just stay out of the community's business
[0:04:22] <%FenixSeraph> more netcode bullshit
[0:04:25] <blackcloud288> Time for GUNDAM
[0:04:26] <+Fenrein> They cancelled the Big House
[0:04:37] <Champstice> Oh shit wait Endless Waltz? gd twitch not showing the name
[0:04:38] <takeme2theriot> I saw the notification on what game you are playing come up and felt the power of the 90’s drop kick me into junior high
[0:04:55] <blackcloud288> Ay while my messages can get through to you all, GO WATCH GUNDAM THUNDERBOLT it's outstanding
[0:04:59] <%FenixSeraph> Gundam Wing seems extra apt considering I just found out Trowa's VA passed away an hour ago
[0:05:00] <digitalslime> It's a gundam game! :D
[0:05:04] <%Valask> give me your money zekeKEK
[0:05:08] <+gaemjurnalist> JUST WATCH GUNDAM IN GENERAL
[0:05:15] <armchairmaster_> gun dam
[0:05:18] <+tobemorecrazy> This is gonnna be fun
[0:05:24] <%Valask> Watch Gundam for Char
[0:05:32] <%Terrarp> Hey chat, so what was your first Gundam?
[0:05:40] <digitalslime> wing
[0:05:42] <%Valask> Wing was on TV
[0:05:46] <takeme2theriot> Gundam Wing
[0:05:48] <%king_wragles> king_wragles subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! 
[0:05:49] <%Josef_Stryker> Does Woolie read sub messages on GIFG?
[0:05:50] <+steampunkkiller> All I saw was Woolie streams gundam let’s go
[0:05:50] <%Theycallmenerf> New Mobile Report Gundam Wing
[0:05:51] <Polar_Bair_8> yo the Black Knight theme
[0:05:51] <%Josef_Stryker> I forgot
[0:05:52] <+AbsoluteX3r0> 00
[0:05:52] <%FenixSeraph> Wingbabby and not ashamed
[0:05:53] <Polar_Bair_8> banger
[0:05:53] <blackcloud288> Mine was G on TV
[0:05:55] <+gaemjurnalist> the 0079 movies
[0:06:01] <Jashter18> G Gundam!!!!!
[0:06:09] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> Dynasty Warriors Gundam 3? ive never watched a single show, maybe an episode here and there
[0:06:10] <%FenixSeraph> Toonami had a pretty good selection though
[0:06:10] <Finaldragoon> unfortunate timing as Kirby Morrow(English VA of Trowa) passed today
[0:06:12] <+gaemjurnalist> but technically the 00 manga
[0:06:13] <blackcloud288> G the most underrated one
[0:06:23] <%Terrarp> I started with Unicorn and had trouble understanding haha
[0:06:25] <+gaemjurnalist> @Finaldragoon oh shit, F
[0:06:25] <%FenixSeraph> @Finaldragoon yep m6kwSadbungle
[0:06:32] <+AbsoluteX3r0> everybody talks about G Gundam
[0:06:36] <%FenixSeraph> I actually wonder if Woolie already knew when he started streaming this
[0:06:44] <%Valask> my zoomer brother thinks giant robots are lame zekePEPE
[0:06:48] <%Theycallmenerf> Rip Kirby Morrow
[0:06:48] <%FenixSeraph> seeing that Ocean Group were Canada-based
[0:06:54] <+theramblinmang> g is a fan favorite
[0:07:04] <+AbsoluteX3r0> imagine not thinking mecha is rad as fuck
[0:07:11] <blackcloud288> Couldnt be me
[0:07:13] <%Valask> fan favorites are often overrated as hell
[0:07:42] <%Valask> or you only appreciate them within a certain context
[0:07:46] <blackcloud288> Yeah lemme amend my earlier claim, Gundam X is actually the most underrated.
[0:07:49] <%Josef_Stryker> Josef_Stryker subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 7 month streak! 7 Months? Time sure flies! On another note, recently decided to make Necalli my secondary to complement my Nash. Any advice so I can devour-our-our my opponents effectively? Keep on keeping one and can't wait for Y0 and DeS when they happen.
[0:08:11] <%FenixSeraph> I didn't care for G Gundam at the time because of the whole nationalism thing but I warmed up to it a while later
[0:08:25] <%Valask> Dude anime nationalism is fucking hype
[0:08:28] <%FuqBoiSlim> lets FUKKEN gooooo
[0:08:30] <digitalslime> g gundam is trash, but the good sort of trash
[0:08:31] <%FenixSeraph> even babby me despite not liking the Nippon Ichi thing still loved the finale tho
[0:08:33] <+theramblinmang> yeah damn no one touches X it seems
[0:08:34] <%Theycallmenerf> Let’s talk about After War Gundam X chat.
[0:08:34] <%FuqBoiSlim> @valask ?
[0:08:40] <%Valask> Attack on Titan nationalism zekeKEK
[0:08:42] <blackcloud288> Yeah literally nothing wrong with being proud of your country
[0:08:47] <%Terrarp> I just want a Tequila Gundam model kit :(
[0:08:56] <%Theycallmenerf> @terrarp same
[0:08:56] <GrahamBaxter> It's true, I think Gundam X has fewer fans than Turn A
[0:09:00] <FlashFrame> yo I heard Endless Duel.
[0:09:04] <blackcloud288> Yo Gundam X has the second best romance plot behind G amirite?
[0:09:04] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:09:05] <FlashFrame> LES GOOO
[0:09:14] <+tobemorecrazy> This game is just slightly better than Gundam Battle Assault 2
[0:09:16] <+theramblinmang> tequila gundam is unironically a rad design
[0:09:22] <+tobemorecrazy> it's made by two people
[0:09:30] <+tobemorecrazy> and it looks amazing and plays like fucking guilty gear
[0:09:36] <%Theycallmenerf> The Tequila Gundam custom in Gundam Build Divers had a sick design too.
[0:09:47] <FlashFrame> Nether Gundam, Dutch gundam REPRESENT!
[0:09:57] <FlashFrame> windmill 4 life.
[0:10:00] <andre11dr> Oh boy Endless Duel is pretty cool, to bad it's not based on a good Gundam
[0:10:03] <+theramblinmang> literal windmill mech
[0:10:07] <red_wolf223322> anyone who skips double zeta is eternally a special brand of coward. this is FACT
[0:10:09] <GrahamBaxter> Hm. Is Gundam X more popular than Reconquista, I wonder?
[0:10:11] <blackcloud288> FACTS
[0:10:11] <+theramblinmang> gotta love em
[0:10:13] <%Theycallmenerf> The Belgium Gundam is literally all guns it’s great.
[0:10:21] <%Terrarp> As a Mexican I'm offended that I can't buy any New Mexico or Tequila Gundam merchandise
[0:10:25] <FlashFrame> Wing isn't nearly as bad as SEED tho.
[0:10:29] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> aaaah yea
[0:10:29] <e1io> SourPls
[0:10:34] <%FeelinNifty> :)
[0:10:39] <%AlteisenReiseZ> yeyeyeye
[0:10:40] <MidnightPacif1c> SourPls
[0:10:41] <blackcloud288> Go watch Wing again, it DOESN'T hold up at all
[0:10:41] <%Theycallmenerf> SEED suits> SEED plot
[0:10:42] <%Terrarp> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[0:10:49] <UTaken34> let's gooooo
[0:10:50] <andre11dr> @flashframe that doesn't say much
[0:10:59] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> SEED is like the same story as Wing but worse
[0:11:05] <+theramblinmang> i hear discourse on greco semi often on like /m/. rarely ever X
[0:11:08] <%Josef_Stryker> woolieYE
[0:11:13] <the_ugliest_known> I fucking love this intro it’s so hype
[0:11:20] <%Josef_Stryker> READY TO PLAY
[0:11:22] <%Theycallmenerf> I consider 00 Gundam like the next gen of retelling of a Wing like story.
[0:11:23] <UTaken34> it's freat
[0:11:25] <+gaemjurnalist> i feel like people bash wing and seed more than they should, they're fun and corny...
[0:11:26] <blackcloud288> Yeah X is definitely the "rarest"
[0:11:27] <%Terrarp> I like Destiny designs, I forgot Destiny had a plot
[0:11:27] <%FenixSeraph> 00 is OK
[0:11:31] <UTaken34> I forgot the cookies...
[0:11:31] <FlashFrame> Wing doesn't need to "hold up" I mean, honestly the best gundam is 08th ms team.
[0:11:34] <Meltingswatches> doodGore doodBeamL doodBeam doodBeam doodBeam
[0:11:51] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I SEE THAT SHINY BUTTON THERE WOOLIE

[0:11:53] <+theramblinmang> i love wings dub but damn is it a slog sometimes
[0:11:53] <takeme2theriot> I’ll always love wing just because it showed me other gundam series
[0:11:53] <GrahamBaxter> FIRST season of 00 is pretty rad. SECOND season of 00 is just a Zeta clone
[0:11:53] <+gaemjurnalist> Where are my Zeta Gundam bros
[0:11:56] <+theramblinmang> yooo
[0:12:00] <%AlteisenReiseZ> AYYYYYYYYY
[0:12:03] <Oak_bogle> @utaken34 YOU FORGOT THE COOKIES!
[0:12:03] <%FenixSeraph> the second half of 00 kinda sucked, but not to the point of being completely iredeemable at least
[0:12:06] <blackcloud288> Yeah nothing needs to hold up if you like it for sure. But BOY was Wing not as enjoyable for me as I remembered.
[0:12:06] <%Theycallmenerf> PLAY BUTTON YE YE YE
[0:12:07] <+theramblinmang> zeta gundam bros represent
[0:12:21] <$RyTYoung> yoooo

[0:12:27] <blackcloud288> BELIEVE IN THE SIGN OF ZETA
[0:12:28] <Champstice> The nerve of playing this one before the one with Big Zam
[0:12:28] <%Valask> oh boy strap in
[0:12:32] <Isphone555> cheer500
[0:12:38] <lem______> KUSOOOOOOOOGEEE

[0:12:50] <red_wolf223322> who here skips ZZ. Who here hold coward status?
[0:12:50] <%FenixSeraph> RIP Kirby Morrow, Trowa had the best theme in this game
[0:12:51] <SableS139a> Fightan history, you say? I'm interested
[0:12:51] <+gaemjurnalist> also F91 is second-most underrated, if not more so than x
[0:12:53] <%Josef_Stryker> Is that a reward?
[0:12:56] <%Josef_Stryker> If so congrats Woolie

[0:17:04] <%FeelinNifty> Wasn't there some study a while back that indicated the T-Rex was kind of a wimpy scavenger? I need to look into that
[0:17:06] <GrahamBaxter> Proof of concept: the T. rex sized chicken/cockatrice from that one episode of Little Witch Academia. Sure, it's a chicken, but it's the SIZE OF A T. REX!

[0:19:19] <+tobemorecrazy> it's the most Guilty Gear of all the SNES fighters IMO
[0:19:21] <GrahamBaxter> @FeelinNifty Glad I could clear that up. The more we learn about the whole Tyrannosaur family the more we learn they were kind of horrifying Hulked-out raptors.

[0:24:03] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> @FenixSeraph glad somebody knows, i know its a mistranslation but its mine now :P
[0:24:07] <GeltonZ> People WANTED Jubei super hard
[0:24:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> usf4 has to many
[0:24:10] <andre11dr> Like it or not , bunch of caracters sells the game
[0:24:12] <%Jack8274> @Pt_Kamen My Umbrella bro...
[0:24:16] <Zayasu> tekken :(
[0:24:25] <@Solidus_113> on launch vs after years of support
[0:24:36] <%WutangchickeN> WutangchickeN subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! Wutang give Woolie money.
[0:24:40] <Applecannon63> Smash is insane with rosters
[0:24:42] <+sinistersally> Yes... Tekken
[0:24:46] <+DreyfussFrost> Never too many. It's fine to have characters that aren't tournament viable. Not all games should be Marvel 2, but I wouldn't complain about having more Marvel 2s.
[0:24:53] <FlashFrame> you know what we need... a Kamen Rider 2d fighter.
[0:24:56] <%Valask> Moba lineups actually get better the more characters there are
[0:25:15] <GeltonZ> CAN CONFIRM! Gimme ALL the sauce!
[0:25:16] <%Valask> and the more viable characters there are
[0:25:39] <%CaptainPileDriver> that's fine
[0:25:39] <%Jack8274> God damn
[0:25:50] <red_wolf223322> infinite sauce-works
[0:25:52] <Applecannon63> honestly Kamen Fighter 2D fighter but everyone has their ultimate/super forms as installs
[0:26:02] <Jathspuh> KoF 2002
[0:26:21] <%Valask> you have to relab with every patch zekeKEK
[0:26:29] <%Jack8274> It's good when you're deep in the meta, but coming in late is rough af
[0:26:31] <andre11dr> I honestly love huge roster fighting games
[0:26:36] <Applecannon63> the installs would play like Bloody Roar/Beasterisers
[0:26:38] <digitalslime> KoF 2002 is literally the perfect amount of people
[0:26:39] <+Silvermavrik> gotta learn a new Goku
[0:26:41] <%CaptainPileDriver> dbfz had such a small launch roster for a 3v3 fighter
[0:26:41] <+BruceyG> Roshi's got a lot, compared to the rest of the cast
[0:26:51] <andre11dr> MVC 2 got big because of its huge roaster
[0:27:06] <deafmelone> @applecannon63 i like this idea lol
[0:27:06] <eldragon_1> A lot of similar combo paths
[0:27:12] <Jathspuh> Kuni monkaS
[0:27:12] <Zayasu> NotLikeThis
[0:27:16] <%CaptainPileDriver> felt roshi and ultra ignorance goku
[0:27:19] <+sinistersally> And all the angle situation
[0:27:25] <GeltonZ> @Applecannon63 FUNNY THING ABOUT THAT...the Bloody Roar devs made a bunch of Kamen Rider 3D fighters. Apparently they're pretty good when you get into them. The one on one ones anyway.
[0:27:38] <Applecannon63> awwwww mab
[0:27:39] <DedlokPM> IT'S A GUNDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM doodTerror
[0:27:42] <Applecannon63> *man
[0:27:52] <agadejobi> I had to come for Endless Duel
[0:28:20] <andre11dr> Eh it's not like AC or BB where there's a huge roaster and everyone does their own thing
[0:28:21] <DedlokPM> @WoolieVersus Grats on the Youtube button
[0:28:24] <fangovafang> wat up everyone LuvPeekL
[0:28:25] <%RyTYoung> RyTYoung subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! Hey Woolie and Reggie! Managed to order a PS5 today, but it will arrive in two weeks time...and the journey I had to go on to get it was nightmarish. Watching every UK site crash, freeze and have a queueing system was awful. Have a good stream guys!
[0:28:25] <+Superbro64> I think any fg should stop when all character archetypes are covered. I feel some games, like GG, are exceptions, because they sometime literally create brand new character archetypes out of thin air
[0:28:39] <Jathspuh> I think 5 is pretty fun
[0:28:49] <%Jack8274> Inner fire
[0:28:56] <HelluvaNohbody> That's kinda sick
[0:28:58] <+Superbro64> The japanese bees have a higher temperatures they can stand, which the wasps dont, thats how they survive this technique. Just so you know. @woolieversus
[0:29:00] <@Solidus_113> yes
[0:29:01] <+sinistersally> It was a few, and they froze to death
[0:29:01] <%Jack8274> Murder Hornets vs Killer Wasp
[0:29:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> like 6 months ago
[0:29:11] <@Solidus_113> murder hornet nest
[0:29:12] <+Superbro64> apparently that was a false alarm
[0:29:18] <%RyTYoung> sbfpRage sbfpRage sbfpRage
[0:29:22] <FlashFrame> Yeah murder hornets.
[0:29:27] <%Valask> this is some zerg shit

[0:29:50] <FlashFrame> Zerg Rush KEKEKEKE
[0:29:51] <YakumoYomi> Murder hornets? They basically did a seek and destroy mission to deal with them
[0:30:05] <andre11dr> Chat we have murder hornet's here for a bunch of years ,you'll be fine
[0:30:07] <%WutangchickeN> was that tree a hustle or a scam???

[0:30:27] <FlashFrame> @andre11dr The problem is they have no natural predators in the US.
[0:30:31] <andre11dr> THAT SO DUMB
[0:30:41] <%Valask> do they have a life bar

[0:31:14] <+BruceyG> 200 queens implies an insane amount of foragers, soliders, and other subclasses of hornets. Spooky
[0:31:15] <GeltonZ> @Applecannon63 Looks like the last 1 on 1 one was Kamen Rider: Super Climax Heroes on Wii and PSP. There's a combo video on YouTube.
[0:31:25] <RyuuAoi> What Tang Clan ain't nothin ta fuck wit

[0:31:51] <andre11dr> To be fair my uncle did work with bees, and Ive been bitten by hornet's and bees a bunch of times, i barely feel it anymore
[0:31:52] <Shardlab> We need Captcha on the checkout
[0:32:09] <YakumoYomi> Why would retailers care, though? As long as SOMEONE is buying it
[0:32:09] <Blank9> but then what about sales
[0:32:12] <andre11dr> Probably not healthy
[0:32:18] <%Jack8274> I had to refresh 4 sites for 6 strait hours to get mine
[0:32:27] <%Jack8274> But it worked out eh?
[0:32:35] <+tobemorecrazy> ZSNES

[0:32:52] <+DreyfussFrost> ZSNES in the early 2000s, good shit.
[0:32:54] <%tearfuldevil> yeah the problem is scalping doesn't actually affect the manufacturers or the retail chains
[0:32:58] <%FenixSeraph> also played this on ZSNES
[0:33:01] <andre11dr> I have a little, IT'S NOT GREAT

[0:35:20] <nests_jawad> boomer woolie in the building
[0:35:21] <FlashFrame> Gundam Wing was an attempt to bring Gundam to the Shoujo market.
[0:35:21] <@Solidus_113> Wing is the Backstreet boys of Gundam?
[0:35:23] <Pingo_Pasketti> If Wing is One Direction G Gundam is Limp Bizkit

[0:36:33] <%Livelinne> Back street war criminals Kappa
[0:36:35] <lycandruid> heero is a psychopath
[0:36:38] <%WutangchickeN> in gundam wing you can have a conversation with a half dead person by wiping your hands in their puke
[0:36:39] <stevo_scar> duo being rattrap helped
[0:36:40] <andre11dr> I watched G Gundam and was like, that was a cool but then i watched Stardust Stardust Memories as my second and i was like HOLY SHIT ,WAT DID I MISS

[0:37:20] <Oak_bogle> No epion? Well this is going back to blockbuster
[0:37:27] <CyberEne> um thunder bolt
[0:37:28] <YakumoYomi> Mark Gatha really sold Domon to me
[0:37:35] <+RowenCleric> epyon is a secret unlock I think
[0:37:39] <GeltonZ> @Oak_bogle Oh Epyon is in here somewhere...might be the end boss
[0:37:45] <blackcloud288> This hand of mine glows with an awesome POWEEEEER!
[0:37:48] <agadejobi> LLLLRRRRLRLRLRLRLRLR
[0:37:52] <seaechiowai> znet was lagless parsec quality netplay in the 90s. think about that

[0:38:04] <Blank9> epyon with the 2 frame combo loop
[0:38:05] <jbrachob> man the tallgeese is such a great design
[0:38:07] <%tearfuldevil> The School of the Undefeated of the East!

[0:38:17] <%tearfuldevil> The Winds of the King!
[0:38:18] <Kei_Ar_> woolie are we supposed to be seeing th fightcade ui
[0:38:19] <%Valask> I love the colors of the background
[0:38:20] <shonensupreme> meter gain in this game is wild
[0:38:21] <GeltonZ> Mobile suits got mobility
[0:38:28] <Applecannon63> The only good thing of Gundam Seed was giving us TM Revolution
[0:38:30] <%tearfuldevil> ZENSHIN

[0:38:55] <%tearfuldevil> TENPA KORYAN
[0:39:00] <%FenixSeraph> @Applecannon63 TM Revolution and See-Saw
[0:39:00] <agadejobi> Gundam SEED Destiny was the first gigabotch I had ever experienced
[0:39:00] <GeltonZ> Oh no they're playing on Fightcade. Doesn't SNES on Fightcade suck?
[0:39:00] <FlashFrame> @Valask that's why "Fightcade"
[0:39:01] <@Solidus_113> fightcade 2
[0:39:03] <YakumoYomi> @seaechiowai Did it? I stuck with SNES9x for the most part throughout the late 90s/early aughts
[0:39:04] <shonensupreme> OTGs are actually a pretty big factor of the combo game
[0:39:05] <agadejobi> I never really got over it
[0:39:05] <Oak_bogle> This reminds me a lot of the power rangers fighting game
[0:39:06] <%tearfuldevil> LOOK, THE EAST IS BURNING RED!
[0:39:08] <andre11dr> Sadly no Endless Waltz designs, i think that was after this
[0:39:15] <Oak_bogle> On snes
[0:39:17] <RyuuAoi> Have this on the GBA. Memories!
[0:39:35] <GeltonZ> If you want Endless Waltz, play Battle Assault 2. It's also really good.
[0:39:44] <+CuppaKofe> @Oak_bogle Same devs I'm pretty sure
[0:39:45] <+koalaf1ed> Geese looked different on SNES
[0:39:54] <Oak_bogle> @cuppakofe nice
[0:39:56] <agadejobi> It's a shame that the G Gundam fighting game sucks
[0:39:56] <dmstiles> ahhh to have a new 2d battle assault
[0:40:07] <GeltonZ> @Oak_bogle @CuppaKofe Yup. Same devs, same engine we think.
[0:40:13] <fangovafang> this game was so ahead of its time
[0:40:16] <+sinistersally> Sailormoon S
[0:40:16] <Kei_Ar_> did the people that made this do the PR Fighting game?
[0:40:20] <RyuuAoi> This solid!
[0:40:20] <+jiggy_snipe> and the Sailor Moon one
[0:40:22] <Oak_bogle> That’s sick
[0:40:27] <GeltonZ> @agadejobi That's why Battle Assault 2 exists. Literally made for the US release of G Gundam.
[0:40:31] <fangovafang> fax lmao
[0:40:33] <RyuuAoi> BA2
[0:40:33] <shonensupreme> AMEN
[0:40:40] <blackcloud288> THE WINDS OF THE KING!
[0:40:42] <Oak_bogle> I loved growing up with fighters like this on snes
[0:40:45] <@Solidus_113> Wool called out
[0:40:46] <townzzzzz> it has BIG ZAM tho
[0:40:52] <GeltonZ> I STRONGLY disagree! I'd rather play Battle Assault 2.
[0:40:52] <FlashFrame> EW better, agreed.
[0:40:52] <YakumoYomi> Oh hey, Big Zam
[0:40:54] <Pingo_Pasketti> Battle Assault 2 is almost legit
[0:40:55] <Jathspuh> FOR GLORY
[0:40:59] <Heroes_of_Vale> F yeah BIG ZAM
[0:41:02] <lycandruid> wing = good
[0:41:03] <%Valask> oh god he was called death scythe in English?
[0:41:05] <%FenixSeraph> best theme
[0:41:06] <FlashFrame> BA2 is almost legit, but BA3 is trash
[0:41:06] <taquito_blade> battle assault one?
[0:41:07] <Applecannon63> Ryūha Tohō Fuhai no Na no moteni! Ore no kono-te ka makka ni moeru, shōri o tsukame to todoroki sakebu!
[0:41:09] <Jathspuh> big zam monkaS
[0:41:19] <Bevral> Gatling Guns go BRRRR
[0:41:19] <RyuShinden> He's a gun with a Gundam attached to it
[0:41:21] <seaechiowai> teach him the infinite
[0:41:22] <andre11dr> In the end it doesn't matter because Full Boost is thing
[0:41:23] <blackcloud288> BAAAAKUNETSU
[0:41:24] <GeltonZ> @FlashFrame BA3 is better in it's original form as a GoDannar fighting game.
[0:41:27] <+jiggy_snipe> he also has a knife Kappa
[0:41:28] <fangovafang> standoff lmao
[0:41:38] <+tobemorecrazy> the forward dash is really good
[0:41:42] <+tobemorecrazy> it lets you go through fireballs
[0:41:52] <Blank9> if you want some really dumb trivia, TM Revolution also did a theme song for the japanese dub of X Files
[0:41:52] <Applecannon63> GODDO FINGA
[0:42:03] <shonensupreme> You can usually command dash cancel most normals (maybe all of them?)
[0:42:04] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Deathscythe is pretty much Ken
[0:42:05] <blackcloud288> HEEEEEETO! ENDO!
[0:42:06] <YakumoYomi> Trowa has a knife...for when he runs through his ridiculous stock of ammo
[0:42:09] <%Valask> why does woolie know so much about this Wing SNES fighting game
[0:42:13] <shonensupreme> i.e. two buttons + direction
[0:42:22] <Applecannon63> SEKI HA TENKYŌKEN
[0:42:27] <shonensupreme> great for follow ups and pressure
[0:42:31] <crimsonsaens> Will Woolie's balls be exposed live on-stream? Find out next time, in EP XX: Woolie Versus Battle Assault 2.
[0:42:35] <andre11dr> Heavy Arms was cool, but then i saw the FA Gundam, and i was like "get out of my face Heavy Arms"
[0:42:49] <seaechiowai> @yakumoyomi that dude ran out of ammo almost every episodes
[0:42:51] <Oak_bogle> @valask cause he loves fighting games and a lot of snes in his youth of chickens fighting mice
[0:42:51] <+jiggy_snipe> Japan is on it
[0:42:59] <%tearfuldevil> when have woolies balls not been exposed
[0:43:11] <dmstiles> lol. full armor thunderbolt... behemoth of a machine
[0:43:18] <YakumoYomi> @seaechiowai Right? It was hilarious.
[0:43:26] <Blank9> GP03 is some serious heavily armed nonsense with the attachment
[0:43:47] <+tobemorecrazy> you can cancel normals with boost jump
[0:43:55] <+jiggy_snipe> thanks Trowa
[0:43:57] <+squidlord482> Is this the snes version?
[0:43:58] <+tobemorecrazy> it lets you do some really good rush down
[0:43:59] <%Valask> one of THOSE
[0:44:01] <Bevral> literal clown
[0:44:08] <+tobemorecrazy> yeah, he's play on Fightcade 2
[0:44:12] <Bevral> Boneless Char lol
[0:44:20] <+kirk0625> Trowa’s eng VA just passed too
[0:44:20] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:44:22] <+Superbro64> 🤡
[0:44:24] <shonensupreme> Unseasoned Char
[0:44:25] <+squidlord482> Wow I didn’t know Fightcade could do that.
[0:44:26] <andre11dr> Oh look it's Char again
[0:44:29] <seaechiowai> @woolieversus heavyarms ➡⬇↘ + YB links into ⬇➡YB
[0:44:48] <YakumoYomi> "Trowa" he's even a name he borrowed, if I remember correctly. In his flashbacks, people called him "Nanashi" ("No Name").
[0:44:50] <RyuShinden> Ahhh Greece vs Persia glorySuffer
[0:44:50] <Jathspuh> PogChamp
[0:44:59] <%FenixSeraph> Quatre was my first crush woolieCHAN
[0:44:59] <+pectusumbra> If I remember right Trowa was amnesiac circus performer/assassin.
[0:45:09] <+worldwar14s> Imagine arksys made g Gundam
[0:45:11] <Applecannon63> Man there is some wild jp games on the 3ds that is a crossover of Kamen Rider, Ultraman and Gundam
[0:45:13] <Blank9> sandrock is underrated as a design
[0:45:22] <agadejobi> Trowa (the one here) stole his name from Trowa Barton, from the Barton Foundation
[0:45:23] <+squidlord482> Nanashi would’ve been cool, that was the name of the protag in SMTIVA
[0:45:26] <shonensupreme> I imagine an arcsys g gundam game every day of my life
[0:45:38] <%FenixSeraph> too bad Sandrock jobbed constantly
[0:45:38] <+pectusumbra> Duo had survivor's guilt or something linked to using a grim reaper mech, and I don't really remember too much else besides Mobile Dolls and some foofy guy as well
[0:45:41] <+squidlord482> ArcSys SD GUNDAM
[0:45:45] <RyuShinden> @Applecannon63 You mean the Great Battle Series. Yes, that series has A LOT of games under it's belt
[0:45:46] <%tearfuldevil> nanashi from smtivA is so edgy
[0:45:47] <jbrachob> agreed, sandrock is a great simple design
[0:45:49] <blackcloud288> How come there's no G Gundam fighting game? That's a little messed up
[0:45:52] <%tearfuldevil> punkest edgelord twink
[0:45:56] <%tearfuldevil> i love him
[0:45:57] <Champstice> Has Woolie not heard about Trowa's VA yet?
[0:46:01] <%FenixSeraph> nope
[0:46:11] <+squidlord482> Yeah he killed YHVH and became god emperor it’s nuts
[0:46:18] <Blank9> sandrock gets bonus points for the heat shotels
[0:46:19] <Champstice> ooof
[0:46:19] <%FenixSeraph> what a weird coincidence that he'd play this game today tho
[0:46:21] <andre11dr> @squidlord482 Not as cool as Finn tho
[0:46:23] <GeltonZ> @blackcloud288 There's one on SNES but G Gundam came before Wing so it's not as good as this. Battle Assault 2 however was made SPECIFICALLY for the US launch of G Gundam.
[0:46:25] <Applecannon63> because some of the gundam designs from G aged poorly
[0:46:30] <DedlokPM> @Blank9 true. it mainly gets rated low because it is in aa series with so many suits with also great designs
[0:46:38] <+squidlord482> I have yet to play Base 4 but I have the rom
[0:46:48] <%FenixSeraph> I'd argue a lot of G Gundam designs aged poorly the year it came out even
[0:46:55] <%tearfuldevil> @Applecannon63 only some
[0:46:57] <Champstice> yeah what're the odds he'd play this the same day as one of the dub voices dying
[0:47:00] <%FenixSeraph> but that doesn't matter, it's a super robot show anyway
[0:47:02] <%tearfuldevil> also yesh FenixSeraph is right
[0:47:06] <+pectusumbra> mmmmm, that SNES soundtrack feels good just to listen too
[0:47:06] <Applecannon63> but it would've been hilarious if the Mexico gundam was playable
[0:47:14] <andre11dr> Nanashi looks pretty dumb ,i even like the Demi Fiend more and he's just tron man
[0:47:21] <%tearfuldevil> like 2/3 of the desgins in G were garbage on design
[0:47:22] <+squidlord482> Wouldn’t G Gundam be the most suited to become a fighter?
[0:47:30] <%FenixSeraph> they should've kept Nanashi and friends as adults
[0:47:43] <agadejobi> The G Gundam fighting game is trash
[0:47:45] <raidonryusei> I saw Gundam and came running
[0:47:47] <GeltonZ> @squidlord482 It did become a fighter twice sorta...but G Gundam was VERY poorly recieved in Japan.
[0:47:49] <Blank9> Gerbera's probably my favorite design of any of themechs in gundam, it's so smooth
[0:47:56] <+blastazoid00> No big zam?
[0:47:58] <+jiggy_snipe> numbers Kappa
[0:47:58] <+patrickng714> RIP Kirby Morrow
[0:48:03] <seaechiowai> @woolieversus if you OTG in the right timing it becomes a launcher
[0:48:05] <YakumoYomi> There was probably no G Gundam fighting game because the series received a pretty lukewarm reception in Japan. Seems like overseas people were way more on board
[0:48:06] <RyuShinden> Treize
[0:48:07] <moogleboy1984> TREIZE Kushranada
[0:48:12] <Applecannon63> one of the king of hearts team were straight up stereotypes like America and France
[0:48:13] <+squidlord482> OMG Battle Assault Fightcade PS1? Big Zam!
[0:48:16] <RyuShinden> Treize Kushraneda
[0:48:16] <%FenixSeraph> Cinq Kingdom
[0:48:28] <agadejobi> Wing and Wing Zero have a secret super move where they transform
[0:48:31] <GeltonZ> @YakumoYomi There are two G Gundam fighters. One on SNES and Battle Assault 2 on PS1.
[0:48:38] <agadejobi> I forget how to do it though
[0:48:49] <+blastazoid00> Vayeate is so cool
[0:48:50] <lycandruid> woolie picking boss character
[0:48:51] <+squidlord482> We need a new Battle Assault that’d be cool
[0:48:53] <+wmeldrum> supers in this game are busted. they build meter
[0:48:57] <seaechiowai> easiest otg launch is sweep after throw
[0:48:57] <Applecannon63> like one was a Napoleon Gundam
[0:49:00] <+pectusumbra> Also for real the Wing is such a 90s mech design though, it's really great
[0:49:04] <YakumoYomi> @GeltonZ Really?! Thanks for correcting me
[0:49:30] <dmstiles> not a big fan of wing designs, but the vayeate and the mercurous are pretty cool
[0:49:30] <+squidlord482> Super Robot Wars Fighting Game maybe
[0:49:35] <%Josef_Stryker> Oh geez. Might wanna put a seizure warning for this stream
[0:49:46] <RyuShinden> @pectusumbra It's pretty much obvious that W started the shift of 90's mech design to what we have now
[0:49:50] <agadejobi> He's only done that once
[0:49:58] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> he LOVES blowing himself
[0:50:01] <Applecannon63> but man What if Super Robot Wars OG fighting game?
[0:50:03] <+koalaf1ed> Hes horny for detonators
[0:50:07] <+jiggy_snipe> Noin
[0:50:19] <+worldwar14s> G Gundam’s “Poorly aged” designs are half the appeal of the series tho
[0:50:19] <@Solidus_113> it's not as bad as MvC
[0:50:21] <+jiggy_snipe> Kreygasm
[0:50:21] <+RowenCleric> Mercurius is so cool
[0:50:22] <RyuShinden> @Applecannon63 Give me my Gespenst Kai dammit doodBait
[0:50:26] <GeltonZ> @YakumoYomi No problem. Funny thin: Battle Assault 2 was never fully released in Japan. They chopped it in half and sold it as two budget games: one for Wing and one for G Gundam. Game was actually MADE for America.
[0:50:32] <Applecannon63> you literally have a hokuto no ken pilot
[0:50:41] <Applecannon63> in SRW OG
[0:50:49] <andre11dr> @applecannon63 That would be awesome, Getter main all day
[0:51:00] <Blank9> Which Battle Assault was the one where they had different pilots and goofy theme songs?
[0:51:00] <+squidlord482> I’d be down to see an Eva fight the RX78-2
[0:51:05] <RyuShinden> Shenlong is basically nerfed Neo China Gundam Kappa
[0:51:06] <agadejobi> It works like CotA Magneto's barrier
[0:51:13] <agadejobi> It can't be harmed while the shields are up
[0:51:14] <Blank9> GP02 had a cowboy theme song that was the most silly thing in the world
[0:51:15] <andre11dr> He would be a stance character
[0:51:15] <seaechiowai> @dmstiles the nongumdams besides heavyarms had more grounded designs
[0:51:41] <+squidlord482> Yo, Unit 1 rush down character?
[0:51:41] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1328635387057758213?s=19
[0:51:48] <fangovafang> yeeeaaa get them lights in lol
[0:52:01] <RyuShinden> So no Epyon on this?
[0:52:02] <agadejobi> The Gundams in Gundam Wing were going to have nationality in mind like G Gundam, but they decided against it, but some elements still remain
[0:52:09] <andre11dr> The problem with SRW is some mechs are WAY bigger than others
[0:52:18] <majindusto> Gundam Battle Assault 2 was mys Jam...BURNING GUNDAM FTW
[0:52:22] <agadejobi> There is a SRW Fighting game
[0:52:23] <GeltonZ> I think there was a not-very-good SRW fighter on N64. Until then we have Tech Romancer where Twinzam V is indeed a stance character.
[0:52:26] <majindusto> *my
[0:52:26] <agadejobi> For Nintendo 64
[0:52:28] <lycandruid> wait this isnt button basher this is pad sussy
[0:52:31] <agadejobi> It's not very good
[0:52:35] <%tearfuldevil> reggie being blown up
[0:52:37] <andre11dr> Like i wtf would Big O vs Zeta even look like
[0:52:37] <RyuShinden> @andre11dr Grungust and even Granzon are big chonky bois
[0:52:39] <DedlokPM> You must defeat Shenlong to stand a chance.
[0:52:40] <Applecannon63> I think the pilot from SRW OG was name Folka who rides The Idalbaoth
[0:52:47] <Vismal> there's a code they can input for epyon
[0:52:49] <Applecannon63> a Shura
[0:52:59] <dmstiles> @seaechiowai I'm a big fan of universal century suits so probably why I like those two lol
[0:53:05] <GeltonZ> @WoolieVersus We got the anime too late. SNES was GONE by this time. Heck PS1 was on its way out.
[0:53:07] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:53:19] <Solidnick18> yeah
[0:53:20] <+jiggy_snipe> yep
[0:53:20] <RyuShinden> @andre11dr Even the Dynamic General Guard units like Daizengar are actually bigger than regular units like the Gespenst
[0:53:22] <+squidlord482> Eva had an n64 game as well that was kind of a fighter
[0:53:28] <%CaptainPileDriver> yo chat, where do you get the roms to actually play these on fightcade
[0:53:29] <%FenixSeraph> @WoolieVersus RIP to Trowa Barton's English voice actor at that
[0:53:33] <seaechiowai> LLLLRRRRLRLRLRLR on tallgeese to select epyon
[0:53:44] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @RyuShinden
[0:53:46] <+squidlord482> Oh weird it sent twice
[0:53:46] <majindusto> Nintendo says NO FUN ALLOWED
[0:53:55] <RyuShinden> @CaptainPileDriver You can try archive dot org
[0:53:55] <Applecannon63> doubt
[0:53:55] <%Livelinne> Wha happun?
[0:53:58] <GeltonZ> Eva on N64 is kind of a fighter, kind of a minigame collection, but VERY impressive.
[0:54:04] <agadejobi> Neo Bird Mode
[0:54:14] <Vismal> @seaechiowai is right
[0:54:15] <lycandruid> what did Nintendo do this time
[0:54:15] <GeltonZ> @Livelinne Nintendo DMCA'd a big Smash tournament away because they were using emulators.
[0:54:26] <Applecannon63> ironic
[0:54:37] <Applecannon63> cause Nintendo is using emu
[0:54:39] <seaechiowai> @captainpiledriver it's not on fightcade, it's a super famicom game. you need retroarch
[0:54:44] <+squidlord482> They can’t prove the roms were illegal
[0:54:46] <andre11dr> Like wat the fuck would the FMP units do in a fighting game next to something huge like the Getter or something
[0:54:48] <@Menitta> no this is on fightcade
[0:54:58] <%Livelinne> @geltonz Oooooh...yeah, Nintendo H A T E emulators
[0:55:03] <%tearfuldevil> @seaechiowai they are visibly playing on fightcade
[0:55:03] <andre11dr> You would have to fuck with propositions
[0:55:05] <+jiggy_snipe> emulators are legal and you can have roms if you dumped them yourself so...
[0:55:07] <GeltonZ> @seaechiowai Actually this is on Fightcade 2 right now...no guarnetees on the netcode for SNES games though.
[0:55:24] <+GaiaGreen> Not just an emulator, a mod that made Melee hella online playable
[0:55:29] <GeltonZ> @jiggy_snipe Yes but they were using Slippi so they couldn't have used their own ROM dumps.
[0:55:30] <Solidnick18> yo
[0:55:34] <majindusto> @Applecannon63 It's ok when we do it tho - Nintendo
[0:55:35] <HelluvaNohbody> Should of done a raging storm

[1:04:56] <Vaxidd8> Ohhh @oAznoUta is that new Ultraman or classic?
[1:05:03] <+squidlord482> I follow a lot of mecha fans on Twitter so I’m slowly getting drawn back into mecha shows
[1:05:04] <dmstiles> kind of want an atlas gundam+drone conversion
[1:05:19] <Thalchampz> this era of bandai music was pretty good

[1:06:04] <+StooEsq> A Doom II WAD called Valiant uses a few songs from this
[1:06:11] <andre11dr> GPO 2 is an awesome design, i love the hole Metal Gear vibe it gives
[1:06:19] <Vaxidd8> @majindusto That might be the one I have! Sounds sick, I have mine next to a similar master grade Master Gundam
[1:06:20] <+squidlord482> What was it? Like Rothschild Comet or something
[1:06:25] <DedlokPM> Takehito Koyasu was Dio in JoJo, that one hotel owner in Food Wars, Il Palazzo in Excel Saga, Bobobo, Deadpool in Marvel Disk Wars, Beast Titan in Attack on Titan, and a shit ton more stuff
[1:06:26] <andre11dr> Basically the same thing

[1:08:06] <+Adriangabs> this stage music catJAM
[1:08:27] <dmstiles> @squidlord482 zeta is arguably the best uc series. not sure how necessary it is for the new movie though
[1:08:29] <majindusto> It was so wacky hearing Koyasu in Yakuza Kiwami 2...As a new character for Majima to fight lol

[1:10:37] <%tearfuldevil> wankbank
[1:10:38] <+squidlord482> Yeah he’s a boss
[1:10:39] <+Skillmammu> epyon is in this game
[1:10:39] <+Adriangabs> @DropFireGemini yes
[1:10:40] <%tearfuldevil> reggie what
[1:10:42] <Vismal> yeah
[1:10:43] <agadejobi> Y'all need to listen to Heavyarm's theme in this game
[1:10:47] <+Skillmammu> he's also a secret unit you can use
[1:10:51] <+squidlord482> Im ready for the Epyon Ditto
[1:10:52] <HelluvaNohbody> WHAT bank?
[1:10:53] <DedlokPM> @DropFireGemini as a boss character that you can use a code to play as
[1:10:55] <Jathspuh> @WoolieVersus It's called a FootLocker Kappa
[1:10:57] <+JWAdvocate83> The wankbank is entirely something else
[1:10:58] <+Skillmammu> this is on fightcade
[1:11:00] <+JWAdvocate83> UNLESS
[1:11:07] <+worldwar14s> “Nerf me!” - Woolie 2020
[1:11:11] <+JWAdvocate83> You REALLY like this song
[1:11:22] <dmstiles> @squidlord482 hmm if hathaway's flash is in line with Char's counterattack, then zeta is probably not needed (though highly recommended). Char's counterattack kind of ignores zeta's existence :(
[1:11:38] <moogleboy1984> Can we all admit that Wufei is a piece of shit though?
[1:11:40] <+squidlord482> Oh really? That’s unfortunate
[1:11:51] <+Adriangabs> I remember Deathscythe having an infinite, or was it someone else?

[1:12:09] <anarchistPastry> im ready reggie
[1:12:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> fight are seems like a lot more work then it's worth.
[1:12:10] <seaechiowai> well the idea is that you can cancel out of normal➡➡ dash and guardboosts you can't
[1:12:16] <+Skillmammu> epyon is prety busted
[1:12:23] <+squidlord482> Sex Robot
[1:12:29] <+Adriangabs> purple Epyon looks so good
[1:12:29] <DedlokPM> Wlook at those eva unit 1/woolie colors on player 2
[1:12:29] <andre11dr> I personally love Zeta but it has some problems
[1:12:34] <majindusto> Zechs Time!
[1:12:37] <andre11dr> Still really good tho
[1:12:37] <%CaptainPileDriver> *fightcade seems like a lot more work than it's worth*

[1:12:44] <fangovafang> W A R
[1:12:49] <dmstiles> @squidlord482 yeah, there's a lot of character development for char in zeta that just goes down the drain for counterattack...

[1:15:51] <%CaptainPileDriver> okay, setting up fightcade isn't worth it
[1:15:54] <RayShadow278> A true classic
[1:16:00] <+squidlord482> Dang, well no excuse then
[1:16:07] <+Skillmammu> dang
[1:16:21] <fangovafang> Here we go 💀

[1:16:30] <%tearfuldevil> so im jsut ehre being salty
[1:16:31] <%hologram_sam> Footsies: Rollback Edition Maxiboost ON
[1:16:53] <+squidlord482> Is there anything different between Fightcade and Mame?
[1:16:57] <andre11dr> Man why couldn't this game be the same but G Gundam instead, i would've been perfect
[1:17:00] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[1:17:06] <seaechiowai> fightcade 1 was more simple to figure out
[1:17:11] <townzzzzz> LUL
[1:17:19] <dmstiles> epyon: am I supposed to be in g gundam or escaflowne?
[1:17:19] <+squidlord482> But Fightcade 2 looks so nice
[1:17:27] <SableS139a> K E K
[1:17:34] <blackcloud288> Yeah shoulda been G Gundam but people like them boys
[1:17:44] <+tobemorecrazy> is sound sync off?
[1:18:02] <RayShadow278> Honestly I found the G Gundam game on the SNES a bit clunky compared to this one
[1:18:09] <DedlokPM> tobemorecrazy seems fine to me
[1:18:11] <townzzzzz> those jump cancels
[1:18:12] <+squidlord482> Looks synced enough to me
[1:18:20] <agadejobi> The G Gundam fighting game is a poverty fighting game
[1:18:20] <GeltonZ> @blackcloud288 Well that and the G Gundam game already came out. This is the sequel to it basically...and much better.
[1:18:24] <blackcloud288> Yeah thats why I wish there was a G Gundam game as good as this one
[1:18:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> well, if they ever go to anything not on fightcade I'll be back to play online, otherwise I guess I'll just lurk in chat
[1:18:35] <dmstiles> you know what? guillermo del toro should make a g gundam movie
[1:18:39] <+tobemorecrazy> it's under Sound > Sound Sync should help with the input lag
[1:18:41] <seaechiowai> styled on LUL
[1:18:44] <RayShadow278> Is this one more like a watered down version of Battle Assault/Battle Master though?
[1:18:44] <GeltonZ> @blackcloud288 Same...though I mean I like BA2.

[1:19:04] <GeltonZ> @RayShadow278 Nah a lot of people prefer this over BA/BM

[1:19:33] <passione13> Crossbones best gundam
[1:19:36] <+susmansam> LUL this rly the first anime dasher
[1:19:39] <RayShadow278> @GeltonZ I'm talking strictly about the systems in it, I feel like this one's a lot closer to BA/BM than the G Gundam one, though admitedly I haven't played it in a while
[1:19:42] <+tobemorecrazy> yeah
[1:19:48] <fangovafang> doodultra
[1:19:57] <+squidlord482> Does this predate DarkStalkers? If so it could b e

[1:20:02] <dmstiles> argh, I keep putting off watching turn a. hear it's pretty good
[1:20:06] <GeltonZ> @RayShadow278 Oh that would make sense. G Gundam came out first and...well...this evolves from it.
[1:20:11] <RayShadow278> Yo why nobody taking my boy Duo tho?
[1:20:17] <RayShadow278> @GeltonZ Makes sense
[1:20:19] <+JWAdvocate83> Not fair, Woolie was playing with a USB steering wheel
[1:20:21] <RayShadow278> Yeah Duo let's goooooo!
[1:20:27] <%CaptainPileDriver> i've been trying to download all the stuff for fightcade but i can't figure it out and their help/guide on their site doesn't help
[1:20:41] <RayShadow278> Did you try a youtube tutorial?
[1:20:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> yes
[1:20:48] <+Ben_Ben817> Deathscythe Kreygasm

[1:20:56] <+tobemorecrazy> those were crazy times
[1:21:01] <RayShadow278> The true busted character in this game is Heavyarms tho, hands down
[1:21:01] <+squidlord482> Have you looked over Reddit?
[1:21:21] <+JWAdvocate83> I’m conflicted. NotLikeThis

[1:22:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> i've been scrolling through multiple readdit threads and some say i need some extra stuff downloaded some don't say anything, i got the roms that they said and the games still wouldn't work on fightcade so
[1:22:15] <RayShadow278> In honor of his newly announced HG
[1:22:36] <+squidlord482> Well on MAME you can audit a rom to see what you’re missing
[1:22:53] <+JWAdvocate83> Deathscythe aztroAntiPog
[1:23:20] <GeltonZ> @CaptainPileDriver Do you have the NeoGeo BIOS? Because that's what is usually missing.
[1:23:23] <@Menitta> I couldnt get it working either so rip
[1:23:26] <Vismal> fightcade huh
[1:23:38] <seaechiowai> this is not a neo geo game
[1:23:42] <RayShadow278> Wing is definitely not my favorite Gundam show, but damn is this game good LUL
[1:23:42] <%CaptainPileDriver> how many fucking BIOS do i need.

[1:23:50] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[1:23:58] <BlackermanZX> I liked Wing zero in this game
[1:24:02] <+JWAdvocate83> This game needs Big ZAM. ResidentSleeper
[1:24:08] <GeltonZ> Oh I know this is a SNES game. Just figured since Fightcade is mostly for NeoGeo games.
[1:24:22] <+worldwar14s> Big Sam everywhere system
[1:24:22] <+squidlord482> That’s what I said, Battle Assault 2 for Fightcade when
[1:24:34] <townzzzzz> what a gameplan

[1:27:25] <RayShadow278> @andre11dr Yeah, I know the one, I feel like that's on a different category to the Psycho Gundam though, since it's more of a regular mobile armor than a big mobile suit
[1:27:34] <blackcloud288> X Gundam alt colors, I see you!
[1:27:45] <RayShadow278> @worldwar14s As long as it has the customization and fighting system from Breaker 3
[1:28:10] <%Jack8274> It was a whoopin
[1:28:22] <GhostShroom> Have they played red earth yet?
[1:28:23] <Vismal> I wanna see a pro w.zero player

[1:30:14] <YakumoYomi> @RayShadow278 Man...New Gundam Breaker is such a disappointment. Doubly so, considering that's the only one they localized and put on PC
[1:30:19] <+jiggy_snipe> Ronin Warriors

[1:31:37] <%FenixSeraph> SourPls
[1:31:37] <andre11dr> Ive seen Gunbuster tho
[1:31:41] <tetrabrick1lt> LUL LUL
[1:31:42] <BlackermanZX> this man is RELENTLESS doodTerror
[1:31:47] <+squidlord482> If you ever watch Eva dubbed watch the OG not the Netflix version
[1:31:49] <dmstiles> new gundam breaker was the first one I tried. one of the worst gaming experiences I've had. tried gb3 later on and it was night and day
[1:31:57] <blackcloud288> Gurren is like the GUnbuster spiritual successor
[1:32:04] <GeltonZ> @FenixSeraph There's a Metal Slug clone on DS that stole this song wholesale. It's amazing. It's called Commando: Steel Disaster.
[1:32:27] <+squidlord482> There’s always Daibuster
[1:32:28] <%Jack8274> Oh no...
[1:32:42] <blackcloud288> Yeah Diebuster was sick too
[1:33:08] <+jiggy_snipe> geez
[1:33:15] <andre11dr> Also something really sick, fucking Dancuga
[1:33:18] <fangovafang> I see it now lol
[1:33:41] <+squidlord482> Ngl I respect Anno more than Ghibli because Anno didn’t become a jerk after getting famous as far as I know
[1:33:45] <dmstiles> @squidlord482 first time I watched eva it was via downloaded realplayer videos lol
[1:33:48] <+p4ntless> THE GOOSE IS LOOSE
[1:33:50] <GeltonZ> GoDannar for me please. That's my mecha anime of choice :B
[1:33:52] <$razielhex> wow. 1996 SNES game? Late SNES era.
[1:34:00] <$razielhex> This is really crisp
[1:34:00] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:34:04] <+squidlord482> Yeah this could be a ps1 game
[1:34:06] <agadejobi> Never thought I'd hear Godannar in here
[1:34:08] <%RyTYoung> NotLikeThis
[1:34:12] <agadejobi> I'm all about GEAR Fighter Dendoh
[1:34:41] <$razielhex> I would have guessed this had been a Sega Saturn era, like DarkStalkers
[1:34:42] <blackcloud288> Dancouga wasn't as good as I thought it wouuld be... But those OVAs at the ends are baller, if hard as nails to find.
[1:34:46] <agadejobi> Jesus Christ, our protagonists are getting bodied
[1:35:03] <$razielhex> but in 1996, it *was* Sega Saturn Era. I just sometimes forget how far they pushed SNES to its limits
[1:35:10] <YakumoYomi> Godannar was decent enough, but I feel like the character designs carried that show
[1:35:11] <@Menitta> protagonists SHOULD get bodied
[1:35:17] <%HarpuiaRivers> For a second I thought this was the PS1 gundam fighting game
[1:35:37] <agadejobi> At least it wasn't a perfect
[1:35:41] <dmstiles> didn't street fighter alpha release on the snes?
[1:35:42] <blackcloud288> Nope Harpuia it's BETTER
[1:35:52] <agadejobi> They ported Street Fighter Alpha 2 to SNES
[1:35:54] <fangovafang> Dat timing
[1:36:10] <%Ecchigun> woolieONEGUY
[1:36:13] <$razielhex> SFA2 was one of my favorite PS1 Fighting Games
[1:36:13] <+squidlord482> Yeah I had SFA2 on 3DS through that snes port
[1:36:15] <+tobemorecrazy> I always say it reminds me of Guilty Gear
[1:36:17] <%HarpuiaRivers> woolieF
[1:36:19] <+squidlord482> It took a long time to load
[1:36:24] <%Ecchigun> BONSOIR
[1:36:35] <+tobemorecrazy> good games :)
[1:36:42] <blackcloud288> Alteisen Riese, GODTIER bot!!
[1:36:53] <dmstiles> @agadejobi no idea how they managed that technical wizardry
[1:37:05] <agadejobi> They made it slower, for one
[1:37:11] <andre11dr> Also, chat if you want some edgy ass 90s robo goodness, go watch Shin Getter Robo
[1:37:12] <Solidnick18> deathscythe PogChamp

[1:37:45] <blackcloud288> Is it all /m/ in here lol
[1:37:53] <$razielhex> the music reminds me a little of Operation: Logic Bomb
[1:37:54] <GeltonZ> Getter is the superest super robot show.
[1:38:01] <%ECRead> I didn't know we were playin DBFZ woolieMIRIN
[1:38:07] <+squidlord482> I’m not a frequenter of mecha generals but I enjoy mecha

[1:39:16] <YakumoYomi> I've never seen Overman King Gainer. Any thoughts, chat?
[1:39:34] <agadejobi> Are you familar with Tomino shows?
[1:39:39] <GeltonZ> @YakumoYomi Seen very little, mostly just love the opening. I know a Capcom guy was involved.
[1:39:46] <agadejobi> It's pretty good, but it gets pretty "Tomino" (i.e. weird) at the end
[1:40:02] <agadejobi> Bengus, or whatever his name is, the guy who drew the Street Fighter characters
[1:40:07] <agadejobi> He designed the mecha in that series
[1:40:25] <andre11dr> Wats the one with the child floating in space, the Tomino one?
[1:40:40] <andre11dr> I heard Woolie talk about it
[1:41:02] <blackcloud288> Galactic Drifter Vifam?
[1:41:02] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:41:12] <blackcloud288> Space Runaway Ideon?

[1:41:32] <agadejobi> I hope you like suffering if you watch the Ideon
[1:41:34] <+tobemorecrazy> the audio is going to confuse you at first
[1:41:38] <HelluvaNohbody> Oh yea the Toddler that get's their head blown off
[1:41:42] <+tobemorecrazy> just ignore it, the game is actually playing much better typically
[1:41:43] <DedlokPM> @andre11dr you mean the bikini girls floating in zero g that get fried by a beam saber? that was victory gundam
[1:41:50] <Super_Voltekka> Does Tekkaman Blade count?
[1:41:54] <agadejobi> FUCK YEAH IT DOS

[1:45:58] <dmstiles> no, a gurren lagann game by arcsys!
[1:46:15] <blackcloud288> Ok but imagine a Guilty Gear game by ArcSys!!!
[1:46:22] <+squidlord482> Yo Capcom had a mecha fighter right? Revive it
[1:46:37] <+squidlord482> I think MaxDude played it in his Akuma series
[1:46:52] <%Jack8274> Reggie LUL
[1:47:10] <andre11dr> No Jojo, because GG proves that they could cover each characters stand gimmick really well
[1:47:25] <andre11dr> Also shit like Carl Clover
[1:47:26] <$razielhex> can't wait until @WoolieVersus gets to shit like "Guardian Heroes" and has to unlock the dozens of characters to play in the VS. Mode.
[1:47:30] <%Jack8274> OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH

[1:48:43] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1328635387057758213?s=19
[1:48:44] <+tobemorecrazy> this game has switch trick
[1:48:56] <+tobemorecrazy> if you hold a button or hold dash (2 buttons together) before the round starts
[1:49:01] <+tobemorecrazy> you can do that normal or option frame 1
[1:49:16] <+tobemorecrazy> marvel 2 style
[1:49:20] <andre11dr> Man, i really want to watch some mecha anime now
[1:49:40] <+squidlord482> This whole stream is just a psyop to get us to watch mecha
[1:49:48] <andre11dr> Maybe I'll finally watch Gurren or Full Metal Panic
[1:49:49] <blackcloud288> What's on your list Andre11dr
[1:49:57] <agadejobi> Remember that time Wufei murdered a bunch of pilot trainees in their sleep so they couldn't pilot the new Taurus mobile suits?
[1:50:06] <blackcloud288> Oh lol those are 2 very different shows
[1:50:25] <+squidlord482> Lol Gundam isn’t anime according to ZZ Opening
[1:50:37] <blackcloud288> Yeah, it's the real thing
[1:50:37] <KaironFortressKnight> anime janai
[1:50:45] <blackcloud288> honto no koto sa
[1:50:48] <agadejobi> Yeah, it really happened
[1:50:56] <agadejobi> Why do you think he's saying Anime ja nai?
[1:51:02] <+squidlord482> You know what everyone should watch though? Higurashi
[1:51:06] <dmstiles> @andre11dr full metal panic is like metal gear meets high school and mecha, gurren lagann is crazy go nuts university with mecha
[1:51:21] <agadejobi> I'm afraid I don't have the stomach for gory shows like I used to
[1:51:24] <+squidlord482> A metal gear anime? Now I’ve gotta see it
[1:51:32] <agadejobi> And I know there's a fingernail pulling scene in there somewhere
[1:51:37] <+squidlord482> Oh yeah that’s a fair concern, it has some solid blood and gore
[1:51:37] <+tobemorecrazy> you guys got this
[1:51:49] <+squidlord482> Yeah around the second arc
[1:51:51] <blackcloud288> That's Armor Hunter Mellowlink, the most Metal Gear anime ever
[1:51:55] <agadejobi> HOLY SHIT
[1:51:57] <andre11dr> I do know FMP is more realistic mecha
[1:52:01] <agadejobi> Someone else has heard of Mellowlink?
[1:52:12] <blackcloud288> lol yeah it's the shit
[1:52:13] <+squidlord482> I’ll just add all three to my list
[1:52:26] <agadejobi> What is this, a fighting game stream or a mecha nerd convention?
[1:52:29] <ManJazzSSBM> #FreeMelee #FreeMelee #FreeMelee
[1:52:35] <blackcloud288> Both
[1:52:37] <andre11dr> I heard it becomes 2 things latter tho
[1:52:50] <blackcloud288> It was Woolz plan all along d
[1:52:52] <andre11dr> Like Fomofoo and the other one
[1:53:00] <andre11dr> I don't fucking know
[1:53:24] <blackcloud288> Fumoffu is "season 2", and it's comedy.
[1:53:31] <+squidlord482> From the description Armor Hunter sounds like Cyberpunk Berserk
[1:53:31] <+cubbywolf> woolie vs mode, activate!
[1:53:35] <blackcloud288> Then season 3 and 4 are back to business
[1:53:37] <Jathspuh> LUL
[1:53:37] <BlackermanZX> LUL
[1:53:37] <%Jack8274> YOOOOO
[1:53:40] <%Jack8274> LUL
[1:53:44] <agadejobi> That's the secret super
[1:53:48] <$razielhex> BIRD UP
[1:53:48] <+mitochondriahousepower> Bird Mode go BRRR
[1:54:14] <+squidlord482> Gundam Ranch
[1:54:24] <Jathspuh> This game's tight
[1:54:31] <agadejobi> Bird Mode is easy to deal with when you know it's coming
[1:54:31] <dmstiles> @andre11dr can't speak for the subsequent series, but yeah fmp has more realistic mecha. gurren's mecha keep getting more and more crazy as it goes on
[1:54:51] <blackcloud288> Armor Hunter Mellowlink has some Berserk kinda vibes I guess, but it's mostly stealthing around and taking on large mecha onfoot with traps and explosives.
[1:55:07] <+tobemorecrazy> if you gave smash a real air dash instead of a dodge
[1:55:09] <+tobemorecrazy> I could see that
[1:55:13] <@Menitta> I need to actually finish 0079
[1:55:16] <dmstiles> @squidlord482 ....that sounds like something I need to watch
[1:55:17] <@Menitta> It;s so cool
[1:55:24] <andre11dr> Sunrise can we get a Astray anime, like wtf, you cursed us with SEEF
[1:55:32] <+squidlord482> Oh I know why I remember FMP, I was gonna watch it when the sequel came out but I never did
[1:55:47] <andre11dr> Where's mi Red Dragon
[1:55:47] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:56:02] <blackcloud288> The Second Raid and Invisible Victory are the two sequels to Full Metal Panic, they're good
[1:56:05] <agadejobi> I'm okay with SEED. It's not perfect and has other issues, but okay
[1:56:12] <agadejobi> Now if we're talking Gundam SEED Destiny....
[1:56:19] <TheFinalHazard> chat should i rewatch gunbuster
[1:56:26] <+squidlord482> Go for it
[1:56:26] <%Jack8274> Reggie! PogChamp
[1:56:28] <KaironFortressKnight> wasn't 00 getting a sequel or did that not go through?
[1:56:29] <agadejobi> I could write a fucking RLM-style review of Gundam SEED Destiny
[1:56:35] <blackcloud288> No, watch Diebuster instead if you havent
[1:56:45] <andre11dr> But Astray tho
[1:56:48] <+cubbywolf> LUL

[1:57:20] <+squidlord482> Foot jab Wins
[1:57:20] <andre11dr> Also Stargazer is all right i guess
[1:57:35] <agadejobi> Stargazer is the best thing to come out of animated SEED
[1:57:40] <agadejobi> It's a shame it's so short
[1:57:42] <+cubbywolf> LUL
[1:57:43] <+shatnuh> 00 is getting a sequel, but it's not planned to release until 2027
[1:57:47] <+squidlord482> Hey doesn’t this game have super jumps? Truly an anime fighter
[1:57:49] <%Jack8274> PANIK
[1:58:05] <%FuqBoiSlim> pain
[1:58:11] <agadejobi> I remember when the lotto had reached like a billion, and my siblings had convinced me to play
[1:58:17] <agadejobi> Like 2-3 years ago
[1:58:25] <agadejobi> If I won, I would have paid Sunrise to rewrite GSD
[1:58:36] <blackcloud288> lmao thats sad
[1:58:49] <+cubbywolf> LUL gg
[1:59:07] <+tobemorecrazy> holding up
[1:59:16] <agadejobi> Why so? With that much money, you could do pretty much anything you wanted
[1:59:17] <KaironFortressKnight> 2027? Jesus. I need an 11th Exia model god dammit (I exaggerate, but I do have a few)
[1:59:32] <GeltonZ> @agadejobi HA! If I won I'd commission the rest of Dragon Half.
[1:59:37] <Vismal> hold down and boost
[1:59:43] <+shatnuh> something something 20 year anniversary something something
[1:59:58] <agadejobi> Honestly, I don't have that much use for *THAT* much money, I'd probably give most of it away
[2:00:05] <agadejobi> Just enough to make it that I don't have to go to work
[2:00:08] <+cubbywolf> wing in duo colours ew
[2:00:22] <KaironFortressKnight> if I won a billion, character action Garo game plz
[2:01:03] <agadejobi> For some odd reason, I like watching fighting games that I'll never play before going to bed
[2:01:11] <agadejobi> Mainly because I am not good at them
[2:01:13] <dmstiles> one billion dollars = rival schools 3
[2:01:20] <+squidlord482> What if you did get good though
[2:01:27] <+squidlord482> I’m not good either lol

[2:01:52] <+tobemorecrazy> the game has such a good combo system
[2:01:54] <DedlokPM> doodOne doodNo doodOne doodOne doodNo
[2:02:05] <+tobemorecrazy> honestly, it's like X-Men vs. Street Fighter levels
[2:02:19] <+tobemorecrazy> there is a Discord for it, and the Fightcade 2 implementation is pretty good :)
[2:02:39] <agadejobi> The Bird Mode super isn't that great
[2:02:43] <+shatnuh> 1 billion dollars = Rage of the Wolves (Rage of the Dragons x Garou tag fighter)
[2:02:46] <andre11dr> Also i heard IBO is really good but ,i don't know, i saw some characters and im not feeling that art style, Barbatos looks cool tho
[2:02:47] <agadejobi> Too easy to block once you see it coming
[2:02:48] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:02:50] <GeltonZ> @tobemorecrazy Really? I kept hearing SNES and Genesis on Fightcade 2 was bad!
[2:02:52] <blackcloud288> Hey, has anyone's love of mecha influenced their lives outside the hobby? Like choice of career or trade?
[2:02:56] <agadejobi> IBO is pretty decent
[2:02:59] <+kawachipto> 1 billion = Bully 2 Kappa
[2:03:00] <+tobemorecrazy> It was in the last release
[2:03:10] <+tobemorecrazy> it's improved significantly
[2:03:14] <agadejobi> Well, I want to learn how to draw so I can make a mecha comic
[2:03:18] <GeltonZ> @tobemorecrazy GOOD!
[2:03:25] <+squidlord482> Nah, I plan to go into IT or something computer hardware related, so not much mecha related
[2:03:27] <+tobemorecrazy> the Genesis stuff might not be great
[2:03:32] <+tobemorecrazy> but the SNES stuff works pretty well
[2:03:49] <andre11dr> Danm clutch
[2:03:55] <dmstiles> ok, in all honesty, if it was for one game, I'd give the entire billion to kojima
[2:04:08] <%Jack8274> LUL
[2:04:14] <PrideOfFiddles> Yea Reggie you tell them LUL
[2:04:15] <+squidlord482> Red Earth time
[2:04:24] <@Menitta> Yes Seed is the best gundam
[2:04:25] <blackcloud288> SEED is aight and you can't stop me saying it! :DDDD
[2:04:26] <Lavrohas> drop that colony on seed
[2:04:32] <andre11dr> Dude i barely looked at game ,i mostly just ranted about mecha in chat LUL
[2:04:34] <+DreyfussFrost> Yeah, I found the game again and I'm WAY too trash to disgrace myself on stream LUL
[2:04:46] <Vismal> I am still trying to figure fightcade lol
[2:04:52] <+squidlord482> Seed GBA Fighting game when
[2:04:56] <andre11dr> Just read Astray @woolieversus
[2:05:09] <@Menitta> Astray has some amazing designs
[2:05:09] <+tobemorecrazy> excited to see you guys dig into Red Earth
[2:05:12] <+tobemorecrazy> it's a strange game!
[2:05:17] <blackcloud288> I BELIEVE YOUR LOVE AKIRAMENAI
[2:05:21] <agadejobi> I was surprised to hear that Woolie doesn't like Shinn Asuka, but then I realized the only reason I like him is because of his interpretation on Super Robot Wars Z
[2:05:21] <+DreyfussFrost> Love the game, but I can't make the rest of you suffer through my level of play.
[2:05:22] <+squidlord482> Red Earth is arcade only so I don’t know anything
[2:05:23] <@Solidus_113> more furries
[2:05:23] <Super_Voltekka> RED EARTH POGGERS
[2:05:34] <andre11dr> Oh boy
[2:05:37] <%Jack8274> Oh no
[2:05:37] <+squidlord482> Red Furth?
[2:05:41] <YakumoYomi> Warzard
[2:05:45] <%jinking79> only one hand full of fans like seed
[2:05:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> is some TRAAAAAASH
[2:05:50] <agadejobi> Where his own voice actor said he felt was the better version of the character
[2:05:52] <blackcloud288> Never heard of, should be fun!
[2:05:58] <%jinking79> their not that many
[2:05:59] <a_mad_dragon> isn't red earth the one with amazing sprites?
[2:06:00] <YakumoYomi> Tabasa~
[2:06:01] <andre11dr> Someone told me Red Earth is bad so im kinda hype
[2:06:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> you get 4 characters
[2:06:09] <crimsonsaens> It has nice sprites
[2:06:10] <+cubbywolf> i come for the trash but stay for the woolz
[2:06:12] <%Jack8274> Of course you only know the Lore woolieGASM
[2:06:12] <deafmelone> No home release :(
[2:06:25] <+squidlord482> All I know is that Red Earth had a character in Capcom Fighting Evolution
[2:06:25] <%Jack8274> LUL
[2:06:28] <SomersaultJustice> In the Year of our Lord, 199X
[2:06:43] <Super_Voltekka> Same thing with Metamoqester and Monster Maulers
[2:06:48] <SableS139a> Warzard time, my dudes
[2:06:54] <deafmelone> Boss Rush fighting game
[2:06:57] <YakumoYomi> Hey, Armored Warriors and Battle Circuit eventually got a home release...so there's still hope for Warzard
[2:06:59] <SomersaultJustice> you better cut something in half
[2:07:13] <+squidlord482> Omg that sounds horrible
[2:07:20] <andre11dr> This is that era when Capcom was up they're ass ,the III era
[2:07:22] <SableS139a> Speaking of Warzard/Red Earth, why haven't we scored a port at all?
[2:07:29] <deafmelone> Im salty we cant play gigi
[2:07:30] <@Solidus_113> 1996
[2:07:38] <agadejobi> Shoutout to my boy Hauzer
[2:07:39] <+squidlord482> Probably because all the arcade players hated it
[2:07:45] <dunkle321> It'd be super unbalanced
[2:07:50] <mecha_soul> Red earth didn't age well
[2:07:51] <+squidlord482> Sounds like they would at least
[2:07:51] <Super_Voltekka> Hauzer and Hydron are in CFE, but we don't talk about that game ukogKiichiJabba
[2:07:57] <andre11dr> So MK 11 LUL
[2:08:00] <SuckPuppet> WutFace
[2:08:01] <%FuqBoiSlim> Capcom refuses to acknowledge Red Earth its in the same pile as power stone and dino crisis
[2:08:10] <andre11dr> Actually no wait Injustice 2
[2:08:12] <MrHeph> there are a couple of these types of games
[2:08:18] <+pectusumbra> SCII Weapon Master is still one of the best versions of that
[2:08:19] <deafmelone> Full Playthrough?
[2:08:19] <MrHeph> they are crazy as shit
[2:08:22] <@Solidus_113> granblue but your buttons are locked behind RPG mode
[2:08:28] <SableS139a> @squidlord482 @FuqBoiSlim But Red Earth is fire though. Man, can't have shit in Capcom's house...
[2:08:31] <%jetjagger222> isn't it the only capcom game with fatalities?
[2:08:39] <%jetjagger222> *fighting
[2:08:41] <+NickHatesSnow> So a beat em up?
[2:08:41] <+squidlord482> Those red earth guys in CFE look super huge, could Abby maybe get a costume referencing them
[2:08:59] <agadejobi> Tessa is in Pocket Fighter
[2:09:01] <%CaptainPileDriver> fighting JAM
[2:09:03] <SableS139a> @jetjagger222 Darkstalkers has them as well, albeit to a lesser, more cartoony extent.
[2:09:08] <GeltonZ> @squidlord482 The big ones are the unplayable bosses
[2:09:21] <+Rekinsinn> LUL
[2:09:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> fuck fighting jam, that game is so terrible
[2:09:24] <+squidlord482> Oh darn, time to look for a good rom
[2:09:30] <deafmelone> Leo,Kenji/Mukuro,Hydron Hauzer
[2:09:32] <andre11dr> Most sps 3 games faield spectacularly, 3S is the only one that really made it big
[2:09:33] <%Jack8274> Please Woolie, they're already dead
[2:09:45] <dmstiles> @fuqboislim if that hacked list is to be believed, a power stone remake is in the works
[2:09:52] <agadejobi> Tessa was in Pocket Fighter
[2:09:52] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:09:53] <andre11dr> cps*
[2:10:06] <deafmelone> tessa was also in pocket fighter
[2:10:14] <GhostShroom> bless Tessa
[2:10:19] <+squidlord482> That’s weird with how great most CPS3 games are
[2:10:23] <SableS139a> Fighting Jam had so much potential based on the original footage, and then the shit we got was a mess. It hurts man...
[2:10:33] <SomersaultJustice> is woolie doing the 1p or just vs all night?
[2:10:39] <MrHeph> metamoqester and monster maulers are the same idea, please cover them too!
[2:10:44] <+squidlord482> Hopefully he shows off some 1p
[2:10:45] <agadejobi> They'll probably do both
[2:10:46] <@Solidus_113> FURRIES
[2:10:50] <agadejobi> Vs only has 4 characters
[2:10:50] <+MocaMedics> OH SNAP
[2:10:55] <SomersaultJustice> Mai Ling my gal
[2:11:00] <SableS139a> SourPls
[2:11:06] <@Menitta> So Linn Kurosawa is in this right?
[2:11:06] <%FuqBoiSlim> the chaos emerald?!
[2:11:13] <GeltonZ> @SableS139a Capcom Fighting All Stars was laughed out of existence. It had a HORRIBLE roster and a lot of bad ideas. CFE meanwhile is more Sony America's fault.
[2:11:16] <a_mad_dragon> oh yeah the dude with a bunch of animal stands
[2:11:17] <+squidlord482> Strider?
[2:11:28] <+MocaMedics> What is this playing on?
[2:11:33] <SomersaultJustice> RERRRD ERRRRRF
[2:11:37] <deafmelone> Fukkin BLADE MAN
[2:11:40] <+tobemorecrazy> he made Fighting Jam cool
[2:11:42] <SjoeB89> Shit how long have they been playing.
[2:11:43] <+SixMachine> the fatalities function more like brutalities on the bosses
[2:11:43] <+squidlord482> Mame or Fight are probably @mocamedics
[2:11:50] <+SixMachine> you finish the fight with a certain special
[2:12:02] <andre11dr> This game is so weird, it feels like it was meant to be Darkstalkers 4 but they just went, "nahhh"
[2:12:11] <+squidlord482> They just wrapped up Gundam @sjoeb89
[2:12:15] <agadejobi> All of the characters have a move that allow you to chop the bosses in half when finishing them off
[2:12:17] <GeltonZ> @WoolieVersus Password to load you Single Player progress
[2:12:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> PASSWORD TO UNLOCK SPECIAL MOVES
[2:12:25] <agadejobi> Kenji has a super where he plucks out the enemy's heart
[2:12:26] <GhostShroom> Leo's MK buttons are nuts
[2:12:26] <SjoeB89> Red Earth is awesome
[2:12:39] <SomersaultJustice> throw orb
[2:12:39] <Super_Voltekka> Leo's got a fucking SPD
[2:12:46] <@Solidus_113> GEMS???
[2:12:54] <GhostShroom> the Orbs are supers
[2:12:55] <crimsonsaens> Pocket Fighter as system
[2:13:00] <SableS139a> @andre11dr I mean, Darkstalkers 4 was supposed to be a thing for the longest. DS4 was going to be a CPS3 game, but that was canned due to poor reception for the board and it's games.
[2:13:22] <agadejobi> Speaking of Darkstalkers
[2:13:38] <agadejobi> It makes me mad that Jon Talbain never got over
[2:13:39] <townzzzzz> smooth
[2:13:51] <agadejobi> How the hell does a martial artist werewolf get stuck to one series
[2:13:54] <SableS139a> @andre11dr Then the game was worked on-and-off (if you can even say that much), and the last we heard of the game was that DS4 was canned to put more focus on SF5.
[2:14:03] <%FenixSeraph> you just know Leo turned at least a few people into furries
[2:14:04] <townzzzzz> close any button for throws
[2:14:13] <deafmelone> Cps3 Jon Talbain would of been siiiiick
[2:14:17] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Note, this game is the first of the CPS3 engine, the same engine that JJBA:HTTF and Street Fighter 3rd Strike. So this is pretty much a tech demo!
[2:14:34] <GeltonZ> @FenixSeraph That would require people to SEE Leo
[2:14:38] <andre11dr> Iea ,and Amingo Ruby Hart were from DS4 but they just shoved the in mvc 2 when DS4 got canceled @sables139a
[2:15:01] <+squidlord482> Chupacabra for DarkStalkers
[2:15:04] <GeltonZ> @andre11dr Are we SURE about that? Because that feels like SUCH a rumor.
[2:15:07] <agadejobi> Leo is voiced by the late Daisuke Gōri
[2:15:12] <SomersaultJustice> oh no fart gas
[2:15:22] <%Jack8274> Cherry?
[2:15:25] <SableS139a> @andre11dr Same goes for F.A.N.G. in SF5. Dude was originally a Darkstalkers character before DS4 was cancelled again.
[2:15:34] <agadejobi> If you don't recognize the name, it's the guy who did Mr. Satan
[2:15:38] <DerpioParty> I can barely contain my berserker rage!
[2:15:38] <SuckPuppet> The idea of Darkstalkers in Capcoms new art makes me sad
[2:15:39] <+mitochondriahousepower> What strength! Don't forget, there are many Warzards like you all over the world.
[2:15:45] <a_mad_dragon> literally just conan with a lion head for some reason
[2:15:53] <SjoeB89> You guys gonna do the single Player?
[2:16:04] <deafmelone> by the way leo is a dude who got cursed with a lion head from a wizard
[2:16:09] <agadejobi> Why wouldn't they? There's only 4 characters in vs
[2:16:22] <SomersaultJustice> oh wait, I just remembered Alex has a Leo skin in SFV
[2:16:32] <deafmelone> not actual lion man
[2:16:35] <SableS139a> @SuckPuppet I want to see a new Darkstalkers happen at some point, but someone else has gotta take the reigns or the game's probably going to suffer a decent deal.
[2:16:40] <Super_Voltekka> She has two different cats depending on which side of the screen she's facing
[2:16:48] <Shardlab> Oh. Mai Ling was in Marvel VS Capcom as an assist
[2:17:04] <SjoeB89> Tessa was in SVC CHAOS
[2:17:04] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1328635387057758213?s=19
[2:17:08] <andre11dr> Max is right, if they bring Darkstalkers back they should make it cell shaded and really violent
[2:17:15] <deafmelone> this orb thing was put in pocket fighter too i just noticed
[2:17:20] <+squidlord482> At this point I’d take a back to the basics 8 character fighter, I just want something besides SFV that’s a Capcom fighter
[2:17:26] <agadejobi> I think you're thinking of Ton Pooh, she's not in MvC1
[2:17:26] <GhostShroom> there's pursuits too!
[2:17:35] <%chll0ne> realistic darkstalkers cmonBruh
[2:17:35] <%tearfuldevil> BIRD UP
[2:17:41] <SomersaultJustice> throwing birds like maria
[2:17:45] <townzzzzz> DP with kick reggie
[2:17:52] <@Solidus_113> what an extra throw animation
[2:17:52] <+TopTieramisu> i see she has turbine magic
[2:18:00] <GeltonZ> Hearing you people talk about Darkstalkers makes me cringe so hard. Like...you all REALLY don't understand that game. It CAN'T come back unless it's ArcSys. No one else can do it. It's a VERY particular game.
[2:18:14] <SableS139a> @andre11dr There's a modeler and animator on Twitter who made and posted some really damn good Morrigan & Chun models a few months back. If I can find the dude again, I'll sauce you the name so you can check out his shit.
[2:18:32] <Lavrohas> is tessas staff real 3d??? or is it just a lot of sprites to fake it
[2:18:32] <+TopTieramisu> mmmmm le cringe
[2:18:33] <SuckPuppet> Ok boomer
[2:18:37] <%tearfuldevil> "you people" cmonBruh
[2:18:38] <Scyllas> Tsubame Gaeshi?
[2:18:42] <SomersaultJustice> LUL
[2:18:49] <%chll0ne> chill out dude cmonBruh
[2:18:58] <SableS139a> @Lavrohas Probably a mix of both. I wouldn't be surprised.
[2:19:01] <GeltonZ> @Lavrohas Sprites. CPS3 can't do polygons.
[2:19:08] <+squidlord482> Lol pretty passionate for a dead game
[2:19:09] <Lavrohas> thought so ty
[2:19:20] <%Jack8274> YATA
[2:19:32] <SjoeB89> @GeltonZ Oh because CAPCOM didn't do it back then or anything..
[2:20:01] <andre11dr> @sables139a Is think i saw Matt post something about it
[2:20:05] <GeltonZ> @SjoeB89 That was a very different Capcom. Most of those people don't work there anymore. They pretty much fired their entire 2D fighter staff.
[2:20:11] <+TopTieramisu> jungle emperor leo vs hanzo
[2:20:35] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I just want a new Rival Schools dangit
[2:20:47] <SableS139a> @andre11dr sakuramochiJP. Turns out EventHubs has a small article showcasing his Morrigan model. Still looks crisp as hell.
[2:20:52] <agadejobi> Yeah
[2:20:54] <+squidlord482> Rival Schools in Tekken
[2:20:54] <@Solidus_113> wait for the SF5 dlc
[2:20:57] <agadejobi> He said "Munen"
[2:21:07] <+squidlord482> Oh yeah one of the RS characters is future dlc
[2:21:08] <dunkle321> Yeah the dudes big Guy and Strider energy
[2:21:21] <SuckPuppet> SFV season 20 PogChamp
[2:21:22] <SjoeB89> Darkstalkers deserves a sequel. Rival schools is too niche even in the FGC
[2:21:33] <agadejobi> Not that it matters, but when Tien's Kikoho fails against Nappa, he says it as well when he dies
[2:21:34] <andre11dr> But chat let's be real we all want Capcom All Stars
[2:21:37] <SableS139a> So to the ladies and gents in the chat, who's read the Red Earth manga?
[2:21:42] <+squidlord482> Capcom Fighting Evolution 2
[2:21:55] <SableS139a> @andre11dr True on my end at least.
[2:21:56] <+TopTieramisu> bring back ono for fighting evolution infinite
[2:22:01] <@Solidus_113> Capcom Fighting Ono's Legacy
[2:22:10] <andre11dr> I wasn't to see Asura punch Haiato
[2:22:13] <+squidlord482> Wasn’t Ono the one everyone hated?
[2:22:25] <andre11dr> Yes
[2:22:36] <andre11dr> He just stepped down
[2:22:39] <Flowlethal> what are bit are character sprites?
[2:22:40] <agadejobi> I think Street Fighter is where they're trying to consolidate all of their fighting game characters
[2:22:54] <SableS139a> He did a fair deal of good things for Capcom & fighting games on the whole, but he's also made a lot of mistakes.
[2:22:55] <SuckPuppet> "stepped own"
[2:23:01] <agadejobi> Shit, you could get Saturday Night Slam Master characters in Street Fighter if you wanted
[2:23:19] <SomersaultJustice> now enter this 10 digit password every time you wanted to play
[2:23:21] <agadejobi> Haggar is in Slam Masters, he's in FInal Fight, and Final Fight characters are in Street Fighter
[2:23:24] <SjoeB89> New Slam Masters game with AKI engine.
[2:23:32] <%chll0ne> what happened w powerstone?
[2:23:37] <+squidlord482> Idk maybe with references, at least Rival Schools is as connected to Street Fighter as Final Fight
[2:23:38] <%chll0ne> apparently there was a leak list
[2:23:46] <townzzzzz> MAX POWER
[2:24:09] <SomersaultJustice> that mai ling move is so sick
[2:24:09] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:24:09] <blackcloud288> Jam Kurodoberi?
[2:24:12] <andre11dr> Maybe we shouldn't talk about the licks
[2:24:36] <andre11dr> But fuck it ,i don't know, i really don't like that they came out like that
[2:24:45] <+MocaMedics> Wait, I missed it, how'd they level up to level 32?
[2:24:47] <Super_Voltekka> Mai Ling did the whole "Asian girl exposing her panties for no reason" shtick before Jam made it cool
[2:24:53] <SuckPuppet> Its nice they didnt make you unlock this shit
[2:25:00] <+Willdog1993> @MocaMedics They had max level paswoords
[2:25:06] <%tearfuldevil> is that constellation dabbing
[2:25:09] <+MocaMedics> oh ok
[2:25:17] <+squidlord482> I think they said the leaks don’t exist until they’re more widespread and known
[2:25:27] <GeltonZ> @SuckPuppet Nah they did, they just had to use passwords
[2:25:31] <andre11dr> @super_voltekka We just assume is for no reason
[2:25:32] <SomersaultJustice> jaggle tooth
[2:25:37] <SjoeB89> That pillar is from URIEN
[2:25:47] <SpookyBeef7> Hmm, got the game to start up but Fightcade is not recognizing my controller inputs. : /
[2:26:10] <+squidlord482> Maybe you have to go to settings
[2:26:44] <+SixMachine> A Red Earth single player mode would be cool for a fighting game campaign
[2:26:57] <SpookyBeef7> Yep! That's what it was. Had to go in and completely set the button config.
[2:27:01] <Super_Voltekka> Change weapons by hitting Start
[2:27:14] <+cham52> ok but did they HAVE to make Leo hot
[2:27:20] <GhostShroom> weapon change is qcb.K
[2:27:28] <+DeadMaannn> yoooo Red earth lol
[2:27:30] <townzzzzz> now that's sword
[2:27:41] <SjoeB89> @SixMachine That's literally what this game is though.
[2:28:03] <BlissAuthority> @cham52 probably
[2:28:06] <+SixMachine> yea, i mean for other fighting games, like if they had something you play through and fight bosses to level up
[2:28:20] <+SixMachine> since this game is mostly fighting giant bosses
[2:28:38] <SomersaultJustice> I honestly wish they would revisit this idea, for a fighting game single player with custom moves and stuff
[2:28:39] <andre11dr> I find it really funny that they didn't use any of these caracters in mvc 2 ,i guess it's because the cps 3 sprites
[2:28:53] <theotrainwreck> oh man this game has the same jank scaling that jojo has cool
[2:28:58] <AuraPaladin> @SixMachine Granlue Versus kinda has that re:giant boss fight, but it's v slow paced
[2:29:03] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> damn thats cheap
[2:29:04] <AuraPaladin> *Granblue
[2:29:16] <+cham52> omg i just noticed the 3d staff
[2:29:22] <+SixMachine> i didn't finish gbvs single player because the mook fights were braindead
[2:29:44] <theotrainwreck> why are the weapons like that
[2:29:48] <%tearfuldevil> yeah the bosses were kind of fun
[2:29:52] <+SixMachine> i was fighting brainless soldiers for a while and was just bored with it
[2:29:53] <GhostShroom> you can Ultimate Guard the balloons
[2:29:54] <Super_Voltekka> Tessa is broken af
[2:29:55] <%tearfuldevil> but the mooks in gbvs were jsut
[2:29:58] <%tearfuldevil> a snooze
[2:30:05] <andre11dr> I really hope we get to actually play the story in Strive
[2:30:12] <SableS139a> So it slightly delays the countdown and destroys a balloon per hit from the looks of it. That's actually really damn good.
[2:30:13] <%tearfuldevil> thats somea rt there
[2:30:15] <SjoeB89> Parry?
[2:30:17] <%tearfuldevil> Kappa
[2:30:22] <SomersaultJustice> YEYEYE
[2:30:24] <BlissAuthority> okay, look me in the eye and tell me whoever designed him WASN'T a furry
[2:30:25] <deafmelone> KENJI PLZ
[2:30:36] <SomersaultJustice> LUL
[2:30:46] <townzzzzz> fight for single player
[2:30:48] <%RyTYoung> LUL
[2:30:50] <SomersaultJustice> honestly, this game should have had dramatic battle against the bosses
[2:30:55] <SjoeB89> Awwww YEAH
[2:30:58] <+cham52> wait is that the full roster?
[2:31:06] <DOGSTRONGG> kenji cant slice enemies in half tho
[2:31:11] <GeltonZ> @cham52 Yup
[2:31:11] <andre11dr> Yep 4 characters
[2:31:11] <TheFinalHazard> they made a single player focused fighting game but still put it in arcades like it was a versus game

[2:31:31] <SableS139a> @BlissAuthority I mean, most artists, animators, and character designers sneak at least a couple of fetishes into their characters & settings in some form. Just look at most animated Disney movies for example.
[2:31:38] <SjoeB89> LEO has fatalities though
[2:31:46] <emeraldskrull> woolieDATTEBAYO_HF woolieDATTEBAYO_HF woolieDATTEBAYO_HF
[2:31:47] <andre11dr> You thought world warrior had not enough characters, play fucking Red Earth
[2:31:48] <SomersaultJustice> I forgot, did kenji have alternate endings?
[2:31:48] <Super_Voltekka> He has two different endings
[2:31:50] <theotrainwreck> Zipang is a clear Australia analogue
[2:31:50] <GeltonZ> They ALL have fatalities apparently
[2:31:58] <SuckPuppet> Do you need to grind or just play through the game to get everything?
[2:32:01] <+patrickng714> @super_voltekka they all do
[2:32:15] <Jathspuh> WutFace
[2:32:21] <GeltonZ> @SuckPuppet Grind
[2:32:29] <SomersaultJustice> did mai ling have fatalities? I thought she didn't cause she doesn't use blades
[2:32:45] <+patrickng714> @somersaultjustice she was one of the exceptions
[2:32:47] <andre11dr> Oh yeah, the single player is al boss fights
[2:32:49] <BlissAuthority> I appreciate the sword health bar
[2:32:50] <%tearfuldevil> GUN
[2:32:54] <SuckPuppet> Ah ok, thanks
[2:33:00] <MacDatAss> the secret ninja art of the GUN
[2:33:07] <+patrickng714> i wish Capcom did more with CPS-3
[2:33:23] <theotrainwreck> THICKENS
[2:33:27] <+cham52> kenji is so cool tho
[2:33:35] <GeltonZ> TAKE THE POISON!
[2:33:39] <DOGSTRONGG> if u get high enough level kenji can perform a heart ripper finishing move
[2:33:42] <GeltonZ> NOOOOOOL!!!
[2:33:43] <andre11dr> @patrickng714 They didn't because nobody played cps3 games
[2:33:51] <Super_Voltekka> Squid1 Squid2 Squid3 Squid2 Squid4
[2:34:02] <theotrainwreck> fishe
[2:34:06] <UltimateDomon> The only other CPS3 games were SF3 and JoJo
[2:34:10] <Lavrohas> what about gauntlet legend?
[2:34:37] <SomersaultJustice> neat
[2:34:39] <andre11dr> @ultimatedomon And they both did poorly
[2:34:42] <theotrainwreck> that tatsu seems busted
[2:34:43] <+DeadMaannn> CPS3 is really a bad board
[2:34:46] <deafmelone> Why couldnt GiGi and Blade be in Capcom Fighting Jam :(
[2:34:51] <+DeadMaannn> fragile as hell :(
[2:34:53] <%FuqBoiSlim> dang I thought jojo was csp2 for the longest
[2:34:57] <andre11dr> 3s only got successful later
[2:35:03] <jimmytwofeet> REGGIE-SAMA
[2:35:04] <SuckPuppet> The bosses seem more fun than 80% fodder
[2:35:26] <GeltonZ> CPS2 also suicides itseld
[2:35:36] <+DeadMaannn> also cps3
[2:35:39] <SomersaultJustice> here's that guy from battle fantasia
[2:35:39] <Super_Voltekka> And it only took until this year fornthe CPS3 to be fully emulatable on MAME
[2:36:00] <+DeadMaannn> but the hardware of cps3 can just break
[2:36:03] <%tearfuldevil> Cleopatra?
[2:36:03] <%FenixSeraph> you've cum woolieGASM
[2:36:05] <+DeadMaannn> out of no where
[2:36:08] <+squidlord482> If CPS3 is so bad then why is SF3 so good? Checkmate, gamers
[2:36:11] <townzzzzz> THE BEAST
[2:36:11] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I'm moreso surprised that there's a category for Red Earth on Twitch
[2:36:12] <Jathspuh> haaaaaaaaaannn
[2:36:13] <+DeadMaannn> i guess woolie knows lol
[2:36:14] <%Jack8274> Wut?
[2:36:15] <SuckPuppet> Oh
[2:36:21] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> Good lord what the fuck power did they give you
[2:36:28] <Jathspuh> now we gauntlet legends
[2:36:28] <+squidlord482> Lsd
[2:36:31] <+DeadMaannn> SF3 is the best game
[2:36:42] <+DeadMaannn> but the hardware is trash
[2:36:52] <%Jack8274> They gave you Egyptian bloodborne juice
[2:36:57] <andre11dr> Look at that SMT shit
[2:37:06] <+squidlord482> Literal Chimera
[2:37:20] <dmstiles> and many years later ravange would find work again as an extra in dragon's dogma
[2:37:24] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> negative on hit dammmn
[2:37:24] <%chll0ne> definetly looks like a kaneko
[2:37:45] <Shardlab> We get characters like this and I wonder why we can't play as the Primordials from Granblue VS?
[2:37:47] <DOGSTRONGG> can combo kenji's c.mk into his tatsu, like ryu
[2:37:49] <DerpioParty> Yes, the pen and paper I bring to the arcade
[2:37:52] <SomersaultJustice> that password is some mystical ninja nonsense
[2:38:04] <%Jack8274> LUL
[2:38:10] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> That's such a sick grab.
[2:38:10] <townzzzzz> sand tomb

[2:40:21] <Super_Voltekka> The forgotten Harpie Lady
[2:40:26] <+squidlord482> If I can destroy it in a fighting game it’s a car
[2:40:30] <theotrainwreck> how you fly with honkers like that
[2:40:37] <+RoboBro1212> this game has really nice animation
[2:40:54] <%Jack8274> Reminds me of Rosine from Berserk
[2:40:59] <+squidlord482> Yep, CPS3 magik
[2:41:07] <SuckPuppet> Fly WITH them
[2:41:11] <SomersaultJustice> @theotrainwreck they're full of air

[2:41:23] <theotrainwreck> @SomersaultJustice LUL
[2:41:38] <GhostShroom> @doublethefun27 lol
[2:41:42] <Super_Voltekka> Kenji's tatsu looks super unsafe
[2:41:48] <Shardlab> So this is where Eliza got some of her moves from'
[2:41:49] <doublethefun27> they have to learn the j.hp meta
[2:42:04] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Funny how Eliza has a move super similar to the grab
[2:42:07] <Jathspuh> Magumbos Kreygasm
[2:42:32] <GeltonZ> No you just keep beating the game over and over. Go for the better endings.
[2:42:38] <%Jack8274> You'd find those codes scrawled on the arcade bathroom walls
[2:42:41] <diddlerriddler> kisama
[2:42:43] <Zero_kirby> yooo
[2:42:46] <theotrainwreck> they're in on it!!

[2:43:15] <%Jack8274> Of course woolie wants more boss characters to play Kappa
[2:43:15] <+tobemorecrazy> he's also in SNK vs. Capcom EX
[2:43:25] <%SilverDevilfish> And now it's Monster Hunter
[2:43:28] <DOGSTRONGG> kenji needs to be higher level for the heart rip, sadly
[2:43:38] <GhostShroom> you need to kill with hcb.P for the fatality @WoolieVersus
[2:43:53] <SuckPuppet> Wait so could you just roll up with a password and steal quarters?
[2:44:03] <%Jack8274> This is a monster hunter
[2:44:17] <+squidlord482> Hauzerlos
[2:44:17] <GeltonZ> YEAH! Why isn't Hauzer in Monster Hunter!

[2:45:11] <GhostShroom> lightning and ice are the best
[2:45:24] <%FuqBoiSlim> you didn't even cut the tail bro
[2:45:40] <a_mad_dragon> read fast, motherfucker
[2:45:41] <guymontag0> Fun Fact: Out of the playable characters, only Mai Ling was the only character to not be playable in anything else. However the unplayable bosses, Hydron and Hauzer, did.

[2:51:17] <%tearfuldevil> it's not like there aren't lots of characters called Crusade or Crusader or some shit
[2:51:19] <theotrainwreck> "MY NAME IS CRUSADE"
[2:51:31] <CasualAlohaFriday> My name is Struggle
[2:51:34] <SomersaultJustice> crusade would have been a cool name
[2:51:35] <%FenixSeraph> remember when FF6 had a summon called Jihad that they renamed to Crusader as if that was better
[2:51:39] <+Deadpool2450> YO BLADE IS COOL AS FUCK
[2:51:40] <+UberWolfman> Next thing we know there were Islamic Prayers in his Theme.
[2:51:45] <+squidlord482> My name is struggle because that’s all I do

[2:52:13] <Maverick2736> Conflict would've been a bomb ass name if they had translated it more directly, yeah
[2:52:15] <Shardlab> Ho boy
[2:52:24] <+jiggy_snipe> Jihad is a legitimate name
[2:52:27] <Shardlab> Lance users, amirite?
[2:52:31] <townzzzzz> so cool
[2:52:32] <%tearfuldevil> jihad doesn't actually translate to holy war

[2:57:17] <Shardlab> Magneto strats
[2:57:58] <guymontag0> Wonder why the dragons are changing colors

[2:58:19] <Super_Voltekka> DON'T TRUST THE REPORT
[2:58:19] <DerpioParty> I think the dragons different colors change their breath attacks
[2:58:35] <%ShinobiPhoenix> this is one of the only CPS3 games, right?
[2:58:40] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @ThatDudeSmoke

[3:01:10] <+cham52> That was the bad ending
[3:01:12] <%Frubblord> @WoolieVersus ninjas were considerably more loyal than samurai historically, they were loyal to a lord for life.
[3:01:19] <+Spider1991> shouldnt have said yes
[3:01:22] <Shardlab> Ninjas actually had honor

[3:02:07] <SpookyBeef7> REGGIE
[3:02:09] <SjoeB89> It meant he didn't trust the ninja

[3:14:35] <ManJazzSSBM> nintendo are killing my favorite fg
[3:14:36] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Is it true that Woolie is the greatest fighting man of a generation?
[3:14:38] <GeltonZ> @WoolieVersus Hey! You should feel bad for murdering the Evil Zone Defense Force all those years back! I love those guys!
[3:14:40] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I'm still trying to figure out if Sangoku Basara is even worth trying
[3:14:49] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> I read that somewhere on Tumblr
[3:14:57] <+squidlord482> Everything is worth trying at least once @shinobiphoenix
[3:15:01] <+patrickng714> Evil Zone is the reason why Yukes made WWE games for 20 years
[3:15:02] <andre11dr> Well that's because single player is fine in evil zone, but multiplayer is just trash
[3:15:04] <powerprotoman> so whens metamoqester and monster maulers two games that decided to be red earth with co-op

[3:15:40] <GeltonZ> Evil Zone is terrible in versus and AMAZING in single player.
[3:15:48] <andre11dr> They didn't play Super Fighter yet
[3:15:49] <%FenixSeraph> Evil Zone is literally all style without substance, and I wish that style got more substance than it got
[3:15:55] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @squidlord482 I mean there's not really many english ones and I didn't know it was apparently just Capcom Musou but I guess bad

[0:01:15] <%JustYudha> No the audio is fine for me
[0:01:20] <aka_Jigawatt> oh you right\
[0:01:25] <%Hawkbone_> "LETS GO!" is Northernlion
[0:01:29] <+BoboDaHobo> I was just about to finish the last doka vod. is minh still dominating?
[0:01:43] <ghostspartan80> let the salt continue
[0:01:44] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:01:47] <ChloeFleurage> is it already time to line those POCKETS?!
[0:01:48] <AFPgamer> Ming is never not dominating with how Woolie plays
[0:01:51] <Jrocy247> he is, but Karma is biting his ass hard
[0:02:14] <%RyuuAoi> Watching Vanquish LP...WOW. Woolie is CHAT to Billy on this one! woolieGLORY
[0:02:21] <Jrocy247> also, Reggie REFUSING to use the mechanic that will HELP HIM GET INTO 1st PLACE
[0:02:29] <Wulfe59> hey I've only watched youtube vids for doka so far, has woolie shut up yet
[0:02:41] <TheArrow_> reggie is a nice guy who doesn't afraid of anything except winning
[0:02:46] <yeetdabsenpai69> @AFPgamer he might win if he upgrades his mgic and uses it
[0:02:58] <kamehamehAdrian> Rise of Kicks?
[0:03:00] <yeetdabsenpai69> @Wulfe59 ?
[0:03:06] <dapperskeleton69> hey gang! can someone catch me up on what happened last time? i missed the last dokapon stream
[0:03:06] <%Hawkbone_> The youtube vids are like, 2 sessions behind
[0:03:07] <yeetdabsenpai69> how do you mean?
[0:03:14] <AFPgamer> You ain’t wrong, I don’t think he will.
[0:03:22] <yeetdabsenpai69> true
[0:03:23] <%Jetzord> I'm rooting for Reggie, but at this point he needs to pull a proper heel turn to win at this rate
[0:03:31] <Wulfe59> he talks entirely too much shit
[0:03:39] <ShadowpulseKDH1> Same @jetzord
[0:03:40] <%RyuuAoi> FUCK ONE GUY DOE
[0:03:43] <StrikingEarth> yeyeyeyeye'
[0:03:43] <alphaelektrik> the shit is what salt is made of
[0:03:50] <StrikingEarth> uh
[0:03:51] <dapperskeleton69> YO ONE GUY WE COMIN FOR YOU
[0:03:53] <Wulfe59> this game is legit hundreds of hours long like let it come naturally
[0:04:14] <%Hawkbone_> What did One Guy do?
[0:04:21] <dapperskeleton69> ubspeakable things
[0:04:24] <yeetdabsenpai69> your way to far behind as of now
[0:04:26] <StrikingEarth> fuck up
[0:04:27] <ShadowpulseKDH1> How many chapters are in the game?
[0:04:27] <alphaelektrik> does woolie qualify for that free canadian socialist money
[0:04:34] <yeetdabsenpai69> i would keep to the anime
[0:04:45] <StrikingEarth> There she is again
[0:04:49] <dapperskeleton69> what happened in the last stream? did they progress at all?
[0:04:53] <%gatorafan> I mean, the manga chapters are all available
[0:05:02] <%Hawkbone_> Watch last stream to find out
[0:05:03] <%gatorafan> I just caught up daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:05:06] <ShadowpulseKDH1> They did

[0:05:15] <dapperskeleton69> but i wanna watch this one
[0:05:19] <AFPgamer> I forgot how boring the early quests are so honestly, I don’t care what I’ve missed at this point
[0:05:21] <%GeneralSCPatton> The Patron of Chaos is here
[0:05:24] <yeetdabsenpai69> @gatorafan true but he has only watched the anie and still thinks Woolie is taling shit
[0:05:31] <ShadowpulseKDH1> Niiiiice
[0:05:31] <+BoboDaHobo> manga also has cam and chat, why would anyone watch the anime?
[0:05:49] <%gatorafan> Some people don't like chat, some people hate chat.
[0:05:49] <%Jetzord> @dapperskeleton69 They progressed a bit but they'll probably be going slow for the next bit
[0:05:52] <AFPgamer> Cleaner artstyle
[0:06:07] <@Solidus_113> O H N O

[0:10:28] <%purplehermit12> There's also the "peace pool" which i guess also counts
[0:10:32] <%Jetzord> it goes to a bit over a grand CAD
[0:10:32] <%purplehermit12> if you add both its easily over 1k
[0:10:44] <dapperskeleton69> now all we need is a shame car and we'll be back in the days of scrublords
[0:10:44] <%GeneralSCPatton> But then there's also 500ish being split between losers

[0:12:02] <yeetdabsenpai69> welcome
[0:12:02] <dapperskeleton69> ah good
[0:12:07] <%Plankman> wooly bloors
[0:12:08] <yeetdabsenpai69> pretty much
[0:12:12] <%Hawkbone_> I still don't understand why you guys are mad at One Guy, he didn't do anything at all this whole LP.
[0:12:15] <ghostspartan80> the manga is always ahead
[0:12:16] <serpenttucker> test test test
[0:12:16] <%Plankman> i'm not caught up but who cares
[0:12:21] <AFPgamer> I can’t remember, who’s in the lead?
[0:12:21] <dapperskeleton69> we never forgive one guy
[0:12:26] <dapperskeleton69> and we never forget one guy
[0:12:34] <%Jetzord> @Hawkbone_ it's just kayfabe at this point
[0:12:37] <ArtooKilledYou> Rage death and salt occurred, this is your catch up
[0:12:37] <%Plankman> Didn't woolie kill one guy?
[0:12:39] <glaciusinfinite> Mihn us in lead
[0:12:40] <%purplehermit12> Gee i wonder if Reggie will actually get over the satsui no hado, like it's been in every single arc now
[0:12:49] <dapperskeleton69> @plankman he lived bitch
[0:12:55] <TheArrow_> I have a music box that plays this song :)
[0:12:58] <yeetdabsenpai69> @Plankman 1? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
[0:12:59] <StrikingEarth> Damn, we hitting these feels tonight
[0:13:07] <AFPgamer> Reggie need that DARK METAMORPHOSIS
[0:13:12] <%Hawkbone_> The joke isn't funny unless there's an actual reason for it. Being mad at One Guy despite nothing happening completely kills the joke.
[0:13:19] <%purplehermit12> He needs to master it so he can take the lead
[0:13:22] <%purplehermit12> rather than be corrupted by it
[0:13:26] <Psych_man13_13> Man, after playing story mode solo, imagine how salty this would be if they had a cpu in player 4
[0:13:31] <yeetdabsenpai69> reggie embrace it so you may taste TRUE POWER!
[0:13:33] <%generalve> is this from P5 ?

[0:13:33] <%RyuuAoi> When's @woolieversus woolieVS Matt McMuscles? #CrimeTimeMothafucka
[0:13:34] <ghostspartan80> I want Reggie to use his behelit
[0:13:35] <ShadowpulseKDH1> He needs to. Only way to catch up in towns
[0:13:48] <%MaddyCaddy> I'm ready for the salt
[0:13:51] <dapperskeleton69> will this be the episode we finally get One Guy?
[0:13:59] <AFPgamer> Reggie can totally win with how crazy the later quest rewards get
[0:14:01] <%purplehermit12> @ShadowpulseKDH1 doesnt he have more towns than woolie now, if he used a behelit he'd lose more
[0:14:03] <Psych_man13_13> Those cpus are bullshit
[0:14:10] <Superdandy96> Chat, we need to be Reggie’s Palpatine.
[0:14:19] <%Hawkbone_> @purplehermit12 No, he only has 3
[0:14:20] <joshua_42> God this song is great
[0:14:20] <%Jetzord> #Reggieheelturn
[0:14:33] <ShadowpulseKDH1> @purplehermit12 We talking Reggie? I don’t think so.
[0:14:38] <Superdandy96> Yes Reggie, let the salt flow through you
[0:14:38] <yeetdabsenpai69> @purplehermit12 he can make EVERYONE lose their towns and even take woolies castle
[0:14:39] <%RyuuAoi> Reggie is his own personal Palpatine
[0:14:40] <%Hawkbone_> Reggie is just Vegeta
[0:14:42] <TheArrow_> it's been years and i still can not believe platinum made a sequel to nier
[0:14:52] <%purplehermit12> Minh is CLEARLY frieza
[0:14:53] <BetterMinh> The more upset Minh gets, the more powerful I become
[0:14:59] <AFPgamer> Reggie needs to eat a herbivore, we’ve seen how far his pure muscle has taken him
[0:15:06] <%projectmanatees> @Jetzord could throw the idea in the subreddit but depends on how many would play
[0:15:08] <%RyuuAoi> Billy is Krillin. Come on.
[0:15:10] <ArtooKilledYou> Begins with another epidemic
[0:15:15] <%purplehermit12> no, he's DEFINITELY frieza
[0:15:23] <dogwelder02> god nier's ost
[0:15:29] <%TheOneUpWarrior> what up my salt lord brethren and sisters
[0:15:31] <%Hawkbone_> Minh is winning currently, he can't be Krillin

[0:15:34] <vexicbayn> what's up my Min(h)ions
[0:15:45] <Psych_man13_13> I can’t believe now much last stream made me kind of want Woolie to start winning again
[0:15:46] <AFPgamer> That’s got legs

[0:32:01] <Brutalyte616> As far as the Japanese government is concerned, the author has paid his debt to society. Which I think was like... 20,000 yen or something?

[0:35:42] <Brutalyte616> So yeah, apparently the author of Rurouni Kenshin didn't fuck up that bad. I mean he's not in jail, he's not blacklisted, people are talking to him and associating with him. So clearly some people are just trying to hate on the guy and anybody who has the decency to have a civil conversation with him.

[0:46:06] <Fujiwara_92> 02 is one of the best
[0:46:16] <Brutalyte616> Yes. Master Asia does it during his introduction.
[0:46:20] <+nekodelic> 03?
[0:46:20] <BetterMinh> You win this time, Minh :)
[0:46:22] <+kekkerscrew> KOF 11 is my favorite

[0:48:12] <Klefth> EX3 is awful
[0:48:15] <+kekkerscrew> darkstalkers 3 is so good
[0:48:16] <Klefth> EX2 is the good one
[0:48:19] <%heroversusofficial> Capcom vs SnK 3 was the best one, don't @ me
[0:48:24] <+nekodelic> MSH is better than half of the versus series tho

[0:48:43] <concretenj> wasn't the 3rd version of SF4 AE
[0:48:47] <+theparisreview> Hot take: Alpha 3 is best street fighter
[0:48:49] <Klefth> EX is the exception. EX Plus a is decent, EX2 is sick, EX3 is dogshit
[0:48:49] <%heroversusofficial> Zangief can SPD the Red Earth Dinosaur
[0:48:54] <+Cuon_Alpinus> and AE was the best version of SF4 so
[0:48:56] <berasite> Super Ultra Street Figher 2' Arcade Remix Hyper Edition EX + α
[0:48:57] <%jiggy_snipe> @concretenj yep
[0:48:59] <Superdandy96> SF EX3 has a lot of potential. It’s just shame they couldn’t refine yet
[0:49:00] <%gatorafan> Also, some people prefer Alpha 2 to 3
[0:49:00] <Fujiwara_92> they'll get right in tekken vs street fighter 3 Kappa

[0:51:05] <RacistWakka> Oh you dont want to play persona 1 lll
[0:51:05] <%andrei11dr> Especially with FF7 out
[0:51:06] <+AWr00tBear> Woolie did #FE that’s all you need
[0:51:06] <crimsonsaens> That's fair
[0:51:11] <+xx123manxx> That's cutting into NUNS4 Time
[0:51:11] <RacistWakka> skip to persona 2
[0:51:14] <+soundcloud_raptor> woolie is just stalling! he is afraid to dokapon!
[0:51:15] <Fujiwara_92> anyone that streams p5, ends up doing the year of persona, liking it or not... That shit is too big to stream it OpieOP
[0:51:16] <joshua_42> P2 LP would be amazing
[0:51:17] <TheArrow_> persona 1 is fuckin weird imo

[0:58:43] <senghoulie> What integrity?
[0:58:46] <whisperstatic> that's just strategy
[0:58:52] <+NecDW4> Peace Pool split 3 ways would curb throwing the game.
[0:59:01] <+NecDW4> hopefully...
[0:59:02] <%ekodrop> ooo did someone else also suggest splitting it three ways?
[0:59:08] <%Plankman> DO IT
[0:59:09] <fairore> @senghoulie never heard nof it is a food?

[1:03:20] <+kekkerscrew> theturtlesnatcher dear god that Doomsday virus storyline was dumb
[1:03:23] <powerprotoman> hard cut to next week "adventureres i desprately need a jade"
[1:03:26] <%heroversusofficial> Mihn is the only man to survive a chuck norris roundhouse kick and come back stronger because of it
[1:03:58] <powerprotoman> thats the kind of shit that would happen to woolie
[1:04:01] <+nintega010> @WoolieVersus you can also view red chest spaces like you view a shops items on the game board

[1:04:46] <$legacy0117> Also, I have read fully the anime and a lot of the Manga. I have decided to keep a record of the LP on paper I have dubbed the Deathnote, and an arbitrary karma tracker for fun. ^^ Hope ya'll are doing well and the Bloodpool becomes a Blood lake before long.
[1:05:01] <+RowenCleric> its called purity
[1:05:02] <%Prevot> lawful good reggie
[1:05:09] <%purplehermit12> Reggies Chaotic good
[1:05:09] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:05:11] <%purplehermit12> definitely not lawful good
[1:05:12] <%NWannabe> its charisma, Not manipulation
[1:05:13] <theturtlesnatcher> @xeno351 that was a tough l.p. to watch
[1:05:13] <ArtooKilledYou> The new hit show Snail Down!
[1:05:13] <+xx123manxx> this is the first time not watching in 2x speed the snailkapon kingdom is real
[1:05:16] <Fujiwara_92> Reggie is without malice
[1:05:16] <%NWannabe> Woolie has manipulation\
[1:05:20] <+NecDW4> I say Reggie wanders over to the dark spot and tries this whole scorched earth thing again. The good boye was a bit too pure to understand last time, but he seems to be catching on pretty quickly lately.
[1:05:21] <%Hawkbone_> @legacy0117 You should post that on the subreddit, I would love to see it
[1:05:28] <%andrei11dr> Oh ,he's got money now
[1:05:29] <+mrcooperblack> I'd say Reggie is Lawful Bumbling at best
[1:05:41] <Casinoroyale80> 300000
[1:05:46] <Gramcracker55> +5 speed
[1:05:49] <%TheOneUpWarrior> yusss reggie has +10 purity it's why he failed so hard as the darkling
[1:06:01] <ArtooKilledYou> That pixie took them and laughed
[1:06:02] <%andrei11dr> Getting a lot of towns early on is very beneficial
[1:06:05] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> reggie is a pure maiden
[1:06:10] <yeetdabsenpai69> LOOP

[1:10:46] <+kekkerscrew> Yeah Reggie could steal them all
[1:10:46] <Xeno351> @theturtlesnatcher using the loop allows for multiple numbers being able to get him to the shop, odds increase. he kept leaving the loop and lowering his odds to 1/7 or to 0% depending on pathing

[1:24:07] <%averyoddjew> ROB
[1:24:10] <%andrei11dr> Minh is like, the Vegeta of this story, he's the antihero we want to win
[1:24:10] <yodajr99> team reggie fo life
[1:24:24] <yodajr99> I want minh to lose
[1:24:31] <%purplehermit12> Reggie makes it hard to root for him
[1:24:34] <%Hawkbone_> Reggie is the Vegeta, we already established this
[1:24:34] <+mrcooperblack> good luck killing a CLERIC in one hit

[1:25:00] <%SirGO0SE> psaWhat
[1:25:04] <%averyoddjew> gambles
[1:25:05] <$legacy0117> As he can wipe out all village control with the Dark Arts.
[1:25:05] <ShadowpulseKDH1> Reggie does have horrible luck
[1:25:09] <Superdandy96> Rip Reggie BOP
[1:25:10] <Jrocy247> You can, Reggie is the one that's able to take over towns, and he REFUSES to do it.
[1:25:13] <light_aeolus> Woooooo.
[1:25:16] <%andrei11dr> @yodajr99 I would be on Reggie's side, but he's been in the last place since conception LUL
[1:25:19] <Superdandy96> PogChamp
[1:25:20] <+xx123manxx> It's his own fault for having such bad "luck"
[1:25:21] <dogwelder02> this gonna drive reggie to darkness
[1:25:25] <ShadowpulseKDH1> @andrei11dr Same
[1:25:33] <%purplehermit12> THATS A GOOD GAMEPLAN
[1:25:39] <yeetdabsenpai69> town fr a non- fight
[1:25:43] <yeetdabsenpai69> oh nvm
[1:25:46] <dogwelder02> towwwn
[1:25:49] <yeetdabsenpai69> right place
[1:25:51] <$legacy0117> As long as he visits Pope Dog sometimes, he'll be fiiiine....
[1:25:56] <yodajr99> @andrei11dr this is true but I want to see reggie crush minh
[1:25:59] <ShadowpulseKDH1> He does have transfer when he gets out
[1:26:00] <%jiggy_snipe> Minh needs to take one trickster to start chaos lol
[1:26:01] <%purplehermit12> sell the spinner, buy the items and field warp and exit the cave and transfer
[1:26:05] <yeetdabsenpai69> no
[1:26:05] <+kekkerscrew> Field warp spinners and trickster and ye could make it
[1:26:06] <+NecDW4> A really good strat for reggie would be to warp out and try and walk over woolie ONCE,
[1:26:07] <Maleicus> he has like 100 field warps
[1:26:07] <%Hawkbone_> Yes you can
[1:26:08] <+mrcooperblack> Big think brain

[1:27:31] <yodajr99> all holding thots
[1:27:31] <+Parrish_broadnax> I am holding thots too :)
[1:27:33] <+NecDW4> All reggie has to do is walk over woolie ONCE, he has no other items, he'll have no choice but to go back and buy another
[1:27:34] <Superdandy96> Wait, is the rise of shield hero just a session of Dokupon Kingdom?
[1:27:35] <TwinBat> always do the opposite of what minh says
[1:27:35] <therealtacopancakes> @WoolieVersus Get better wapons
[1:27:37] <plo135> Go for Groat
[1:27:39] <berasite> i couldn't do it with the roadblock
[1:27:52] <berasite> so pretty sure you can't if is a quest item
[1:27:57] <berasite> only gift items
[1:28:01] <aka_Jigawatt> does the item store have a guided warp?
[1:28:04] <+xx123manxx> snailkapon BrokeBack

[1:28:32] <yeetdabsenpai69> do not trust the lies of Mihn the temple will not help you here woolie run to the palace
[1:28:54] <%gatorafan> But Woolie is a cleric, if the temple doesn't help him, who will?
[1:29:05] <yodajr99> a worm
[1:29:09] <$legacy0117> Oh well. We don't Snailkapon, or I don't. Hopefully Reggie can sneak get some Heveanly potions.

[1:30:14] <yodajr99> minh trying to max speed
[1:30:18] <yeetdabsenpai69> and he has like no points
[1:30:20] <TheArrow_> follow your heart
[1:30:21] <dastmwolf> is it a good strategy to just up speed like this?
[1:30:24] <%andrei11dr> AND THATS WHY YOU PUMP SPEED FOLKS, JUST LIKE JFK THOUGHT US Kappa
[1:30:26] <+PenGia> No
[1:30:40] <Xeno351> it might actually be the worst strat
[1:30:42] <Klefth> You're trying to do what!?
[1:30:44] <Maleicus> hes gonna escape anyways
[1:30:44] <crimsonsaens> You're already at the top so there's no reason to escape
[1:30:44] <light_aeolus> Please. Invest in something else.
[1:30:52] <yeetdabsenpai69> @dastmwolf for a short time later monsters start using undodgeable magic that will instagib him
[1:30:54] <yodajr99> woolie will level magic and crush everyone cause nobody has magic but him
[1:31:04] <%optimasmaximas> optimasmaximas subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 4 month streak! WTF I DIDNT GET A NOTIFICATION! TWIIIIIITCH
[1:31:05] <yeetdabsenpai69> exactly
[1:31:07] <+PenGia> As soon as anyone goes magician they will annihilate him
[1:31:14] <whisperstatic> high speed is apparently great, but magic will destroy him
[1:31:21] <%kyh9> MINH'S SECRET ART: HIDDEN SANDBAG
[1:31:25] <yeetdabsenpai69> if they use magic which these guys seem to hate
[1:31:25] <aka_Jigawatt> FINAL FUCK
[1:31:29] <TheArrow_> FINAL FUCK
[1:31:31] <yodajr99> high speed and hp is god tier
[1:31:33] <+MrRabbles> the last fuck
[1:31:35] <+Target616> But doesnt magic need speed to actually hit him?
[1:31:36] <ShadowpulseKDH1> Finally!
[1:31:42] <yeetdabsenpai69> no
[1:31:43] <yeildingthought> Final Fuck LUL
[1:31:46] <yodajr99> @target616 no

[1:32:28] <light_aeolus> @whisperstatic Speed is both dodge and accuracy. Just as magic is both magical damage output and absorption.

[1:35:09] <%jiggy_snipe> lol
[1:35:09] <yodajr99> worm op
[1:35:10] <crimsonsaens> That worm is putting in work
[1:35:12] <%purplehermit12> stupid ai should've striked
[1:35:13] <$legacy0117> Reggie will always be the guy I root for, but this game's equalizer system isn't the best...Unless you really, really don't care.
[1:35:13] <KRaZyAmmo> when did woolie get swoll?
[1:35:15] <+kekkerscrew> Paralyzed he can't use inputs
[1:35:17] <+NecDW4> If woolie dies its possible he could get there first
[1:35:19] <light_aeolus> The warm gloves do have use in the cold. Won't say what tho.
[1:35:25] <dastmwolf> if the later towns in the game are the ones that count Reggie can definetly win
[1:35:30] <+NecDW4> if reggie spins bad a few times
[1:35:33] <Klefth> LUL
[1:35:34] <yeetdabsenpai69> CHEST
[1:35:37] <yeetdabsenpai69> DO IT
[1:35:38] <+kekkerscrew> CHEST
[1:35:44] <%andrei11dr> I was team Reggie until he got only 5s on darkling, then is lost all fate LUL
[1:35:46] <crimsonsaens> Good play
[1:35:49] <+kekkerscrew> Fantastic chest ahead
[1:35:50] <yodajr99> normally I want minh to win but he is the enemy in dokapon
[1:35:52] <ShadowpulseKDH1> If Reggie pulls this off, then I’m back on team Reggie. He just needs to give me something to work with!
[1:36:06] <Maleicus> same
[1:36:11] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> what's the possibility of that worm killing woolz and taking one of his quest items? that'd be very scary
[1:36:18] <light_aeolus> Oh yeah, this town's pretty important? I think?
[1:36:22] <%heroversusofficial> I'm forever team reggie
[1:36:24] <yodajr99> that worm could kill him rn
[1:36:26] <yeetdabsenpai69> does woolie not have a transfer
[1:36:37] <NickHatesSnow> I'm team Minh all the way
[1:36:40] <%purplehermit12> no @yeetdabsenpai69
[1:36:44] <ShadowpulseKDH1> I don’t want Woolie to win since I think it would be funny
[1:36:45] <+gustavozxd> woolie cannot contain himself, he wants to fuck people up
[1:36:46] <%purplehermit12> Nah ided swap with minh now
[1:36:48] <yeetdabsenpai69> ahw
[1:36:54] <+NecDW4> OH GOD, what if reggie walks over woolie before he dies and takes an item, then woolz loses a second to the worm
[1:36:55] <yodajr99> just let woolie die to the worm reggie
[1:36:55] <Klefth> I think you shouldn't have opened your mouth, Reggie
[1:36:58] <+NecDW4> the BIGGEST salt
[1:36:59] <Psych_man13_13> NOTHING
[1:37:01] <%heroversusofficial> Montreal bagels
[1:37:02] <+xx123manxx> I'm back on team reggie if he his this transfer
[1:37:02] <%Jetzord> Reggie, come on man
[1:37:04] <+agumon9000> Reggie what if the Transfer misses?
[1:37:06] <+kekkerscrew> Woolie is squeezed and can't fight so he can super die
[1:37:11] <+xx123manxx> nvm im off reggie team again
[1:37:12] <dastmwolf> I honestly don't care who wins. I just wanna see the most PJSalt possible ahah
[1:37:13] <SethKyu> It might haved healed, but you had full health?
[1:37:18] <%andrei11dr> Im with Minh, he's the lesser of 2 evils
[1:37:18] <$legacy0117> Minh Bison never forgives, and his 'liberations' are best described as indefinite indentured servitude. x3
[1:37:20] <popcultureaficionado> Minhs liberation of the free world continues as the others chase his coattails.
[1:37:21] <light_aeolus> same
[1:37:21] <dogwelder02> oh boy
[1:37:21] <theturtlesnatcher> if Reggie swaps im in
[1:37:25] <Xeno351> minh will really need to start pumping atk soon

[1:42:58] <%heroversusofficial> Woolie not being in first would benefit Minh
[1:43:02] <Xeno351> reggie should just look out for himself that's HOW THE GAME IS PLAYED
[1:43:03] <light_aeolus> nice taste, pilly
[1:43:09] <crimsonsaens> You had a dark council last stream?
[1:43:11] <yeildingthought> There was no collusion Kappa
[1:43:25] <%0raison> haaa kaaachiii
[1:43:31] <%xcompleasedad> YOU HAD A COUNCIL LAST STREAM
[1:43:32] <themightyseptopus> 1v1v1 always turns into a 2v1 sooner or later
[1:43:33] <fetrigon> BUT THAT'S POLITICS WOOLIE!!
[1:43:34] <yodajr99> minh deserves the 2 on 1
[1:43:40] <%Hawkbone_> Reggie, use the Transfer on Woolie
[1:43:45] <%xcompleasedad> WHAT A FUCKING LAIR
[1:43:45] <%andrei11dr> HOSE MAD
[1:43:48] <berasite> item store
[1:43:51] <%purplehermit12> transferring with woolie is probably better
[1:43:54] <fetrigon> THIS GAME IS ALL ABOUT POLITICS
[1:43:59] <berasite> on 3 continent
[1:43:59] <dastmwolf> it's not collusion when the brothers unite to fight the petit Asian
[1:44:02] <%xcompleasedad> Woolie the liar all UP in this bitch
[1:44:04] <nachohangovers> The hit chance will be better on Woolie.
[1:44:09] <+pectusumbra> better to swap with woolie when he gets closer
[1:44:22] <$legacy0117> Dioooooooooo! You are our only chance of survival from M. Bison at this rate!
[1:44:23] <whisperstatic> LUL
[1:44:24] <%Rhinoprotoss> Swap max speed Minh

[1:44:25] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @yeetdabsenpai69

[1:45:01] <+xx123manxx> try your luck with store warp Kappa
[1:45:07] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Does vanish help against spells?
[1:45:11] <+Target616> yes

[1:45:30] <+PenGia> store warp
[1:45:31] <%trustycoyote> trustycoyote subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[1:45:33] <%Hawkbone_> Reggie already got the contract 3 times
[1:45:39] <manicpuppet711> i still want to see one of them get the hero class
[1:45:47] <yodajr99> and he will not use it
[1:45:47] <%purplehermit12> thats ages away @manicpuppet711
[1:45:53] <$legacy0117> That, is saddening.
[1:45:56] <%jiggy_snipe> Minh's lying in wait for Woolie
[1:46:14] <aka_Jigawatt> what luck
[1:46:14] <+agumon9000> Wow Reggie's plan failed very swiftly
[1:46:15] <+Gespens> attack him!
[1:46:24] <%jiggy_snipe> now he needs run
[1:46:28] <berasite> reggie can't hold all this behelit
[1:46:31] <whisperstatic> Reggie at risk
[1:46:36] <%purplehermit12> reggie needs to do less fighting and more running to the castle
[1:46:40] <%andrei11dr> Holy shit the luck
[1:46:47] <%purplehermit12> dudes just been grinding constantly
[1:46:52] <nachohangovers> Reggie just book it.
[1:46:56] <+Target616> hero is way past endgame, like you need to delay beating the game realistically
[1:47:08] <%purplehermit12> put woolie to sleep
[1:47:09] <$legacy0117> Luckily, multiple contracts cannot float around at the same time at least. x.x
[1:47:17] <%jiggy_snipe> Reggie could have bought a 3 spinner before NotLikeThis
[1:47:17] <+pectusumbra> transfer with woolie
[1:47:18] <whisperstatic> q
[1:47:19] <%Hawkbone_> Reggie should run farther away from the castle and use the Transfer when Woolie is close
[1:47:22] <%andrei11dr> Reggie still has Curse dosen't he
[1:47:24] <+xx123manxx> Put on your heelies and start zoomin reggie

[1:49:14] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[1:49:15] <crimsonsaens> Reggie is now at the castle
[1:49:18] <Jrocy247> KIM RINGTONE

[1:49:18] <%NWannabe> Rangers?
[1:49:18] <whisperstatic> Drop your shield. perfect. know what I mean?
[1:49:18] <TrafficCohen> WHAT
[1:49:21] <dastmwolf> Reggie stand should be called Shitty Luck
[1:49:22] <+gustavozxd> @Gespens WeirdChamp
[1:49:22] <+abrupt_abe> What's the sitch?
[1:49:24] <dogwelder02> oh this might work out
[1:49:27] <powerprotoman> that was the pwoer ranegrs morpher beep guys
[1:49:31] <LeviathanNexus> Greed to Karma combo
[1:49:32] <+nintega010> thtat actually helped Reggie cause he never went to temle
[1:49:36] <%andrei11dr> @yodajr99 And that's why team Reggie is doomed LUL
[1:49:37] <%purplehermit12> Reggie the transfers FIFTY percent
[1:49:38] <+Parrish_broadnax> Haha Your Points, Hand them Over
[1:49:39] <+FloorBurger> Somebody's getting fucked!
[1:49:41] <%purplehermit12> potentially.
[1:49:46] <Xeno351> but then it would have only been better to hit woolie
[1:49:48] <%Solidnick18> minh has huge stonks
[1:49:54] <+xx123manxx> If this works im back on team Reggie forever
[1:49:55] <glaciusinfinite> Whats the sitch
[1:50:00] <%heroversusofficial> Oh man
[1:50:02] <%heroversusofficial> The race is on
[1:50:02] <+gustavozxd> points or feet pics, hand it over
[1:50:09] <%heroversusofficial> Reggie secret plan?
[1:50:09] <powerprotoman> So to explain reggies plan he wanted woolie to get closer and then use transfer to swap with him and then three spinner
[1:50:10] <yodajr99> @andrei11dr I have hope for him still
[1:50:14] <+NecDW4> oh SHIT, reggie thinkin ahead on that one
[1:50:16] <Xeno351> the original spell usage is still objectively bad
[1:50:17] <%Hawkbone_> Did Reggie just accidentally make a fucking gigabrain play?
[1:50:17] <crimsonsaens> Why didn't he use sleep on Woolie?
[1:50:28] <+Parrish_broadnax> Too bad he didnt think of head of that beatdown
[1:50:33] <%purplehermit12> that play only works sometimes
[1:50:34] <%andrei11dr> Watch Reggie win this somehow
[1:50:35] <jesse_kun1> uh oh
[1:50:37] <%purplehermit12> it was a huge risk
[1:50:43] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> what a time to randomly unlock woolieREGGIEFUL
[1:50:43] <%purplehermit12> because if the monster made him drop the tricksters
[1:50:48] <%purplehermit12> he'd have been fucked
[1:50:49] <berasite> @crimsonsaens so he can use transfern and switch places with him
[1:50:50] <yodajr99> @hawkbone_ he could turn it into one
[1:50:54] <light_aeolus> Whereis Reggie respawning?
[1:50:54] <+Gespens> WOOLIE THE COWARD
[1:50:55] <+Parrish_broadnax> He was focusing on steps 2- 5 but didnt look at step 1
[1:50:55] <+PenGia> that was free exp
[1:50:56] <%jiggy_snipe> you shouldnt put yourself in combat at all tho
[1:51:05] <light_aeolus> OH.
[1:51:08] <%Hawkbone_> REGGIE IS GONNA WIN
[1:51:10] <+xx123manxx> bawkPoggers bawkPoggers bawkPoggers

[1:51:18] <berasite> big brain
[1:51:21] <%NWannabe> Where do people rez?

[1:51:27] <yeildingthought> Yo!~ Reggie! PogChamp
[1:51:30] <Fujiwara_92> REGGIE MUST WIN
[1:51:31] <popcultureaficionado> MY MOVE IS TO DIE
[1:51:32] <berasite> what a solution, just die
[1:51:32] <%purplehermit12> @NWannabe the castle, unless they rest at a temple
[1:51:33] <Jetsfantasy> As Dio said, the more you plan things out, the more things can go wrong
[1:51:33] <theturtlesnatcher> he did a pro gamer movs
[1:51:36] <berasite> it will make you win
[1:51:38] <yodajr99> rise up reggies
[1:51:39] <%xcompleasedad> WATCH THE FOOL ROLL NOTHING BUT 2'S Hahahahaha
[1:51:42] <%NWannabe> Precisely. ell played
[1:51:42] <whisperstatic> Rez and roll a five
[1:51:43] <Gramcracker55> and he can transfer hopefully back to the 3rd continent.
[1:51:46] <Maleicus> watch him not be able to land in it first
[1:51:56] <%andrei11dr> Random town though
[1:52:07] <kingofjibs> Finally more dokapon
[1:52:11] <Klefth> Knowing Reggie's luck, he'll start running twos... :/
[1:52:20] <+Parrish_broadnax> All the choices
[1:52:23] <%heroversusofficial> I believe in it

[2:39:43] <+gustavozxd> yes woolie, let the salt flow through you
[2:39:46] <Gramcracker55> a better magic defense seems like a good idea.
[2:39:50] <+Rivalsz> the bias is apparent
[2:39:55] <%Hawkbone_> I think Reggie could totally take Woolie in a fight, but I'm not sure about Minh.
[2:40:02] <Axle13j> LOL
[2:40:05] <+Rivalsz> no spoilers chat
[2:40:05] <crimsonsaens> Sell something for Seal Magic maybe?
[2:40:09] <+gustavozxd> LUL at least he's honest
[2:40:10] <ShadowpulseKDH1> Ming is pretty high level
[2:40:16] <sonofthedeepsouth> Alpha is Chad and people that discredit it are memes. Wolves work in packs that have alphas pairing in order words a family but still Alphas
[2:40:26] <ShadowpulseKDH1> *Minh
[2:40:37] <sonofthedeepsouth> DABS ALPHALY
[2:40:38] <%Hawkbone_> Alpha wolves literally don't even exist
[2:40:38] <+InfiniteHav0k> get gust
[2:40:40] <+NecDW4> LOL it's funny seeing Woolie not used to being the one in last place for once

[2:40:50] <hookhis> y'know

[2:40:59] <ShadowpulseKDH1> Woolie throwing shade!
[2:41:00] <berasite> NotLikeThis i know minh has no magic but he can always buy
[2:41:02] <%Hawkbone_> Woolie is getting real salty in last place.
[2:41:04] <%purplehermit12> isnt reggie straight up stronger than minh?
[2:41:04] <Fujiwara_92> LUL
[2:41:06] <berasite> thing to defend himself
[2:41:11] <vVAstrAVv> "im a threat" y'know
[2:41:11] <+mrcooperblack> a common cold was a threat too dog
[2:41:12] <buerdo> Woolie gonna go across that sectional at minh if hw plays nice with reggie
[2:41:13] <%purplehermit12> like, character wise
[2:41:13] <%Jetzord> I'm just hoping Reggie Purse Cutters Minh to start
[2:41:14] <crimsonsaens> RIP Seal Magic
[2:41:14] <yeildingthought> Woolie don’t die LUL
[2:41:14] <%jiggy_snipe> Reggie did kill Minh earlier but Minh has leveled 2 twice I think
[2:41:17] <yodajr99> the whole alpha concept doesn't exist
[2:41:20] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> If Woolie can get gust from the magic shop he easily stomps Mihn in combat
[2:41:21] <emperordread> From rags to bitches; Reggie's success story
[2:41:21] <%yeknomlive> they're emulating so yeah. this is the wii version
[2:41:23] <dastmwolf> if Minh doesn't dodge Reggie can probs wipe him out in one attack
[2:41:23] <+pectusumbra> Minh is just so fast though, he's really hard to touch
[2:41:27] <%Hawkbone_> @purplehermit12 He has way more attack but Minh is a speedy speedy boi
[2:41:29] <NeroInfinite> yeah but mihn has big speed.
[2:41:35] <+kekkerscrew> The old dogs
[2:41:37] <berasite> magic > speed
[2:41:40] <yeetdabsenpai69> GET GOOD MAGIC

[2:46:27] <Fujiwara_92> thank mew
[2:46:27] <Gramcracker55> Typically if you don't go for a magic build your magic stat ends up quite low.
[2:46:37] <%Hawkbone_> Woolie deserves those kicks
[2:46:42] <Superdandy96> How important is magic in this game?
[2:46:46] <%yeknomlive> but doesnt reduce as much damage
[2:46:46] <berasite> alot
[2:46:51] <%jiggy_snipe> very
[2:46:52] <berasite> at least late game
[2:46:53] <Gramcracker55> Depends
[2:46:54] <+InfiniteHav0k> magic very important
[2:47:04] <Xeno351> late game you need defense against it in some form
[2:47:07] <+InfiniteHav0k> the longer the game goes
[2:47:09] <Psych_man13_13> Reggie def has more mg than Minh
[2:47:09] <+paladinstarbuster> Somebody should of went magic
[2:47:09] <Superdandy96> Uh oh
[2:47:10] <berasite> early magic is kinda bad, but later on it becomes super good
[2:47:10] <%andrei11dr> @superdandy96 You can't dodge it, so pretty good
[2:47:11] <%Hawkbone_> Woolie is so fucking salty

[2:47:32] <sonofthedeepsouth> Yeah dolphins are something eçse
[2:47:32] <%yeknomlive> the magic monsters are rough without guard
[2:47:35] <Gramcracker55> Late game magic is not that great with Magic guard dx . but mid game it can be quite powerfull.
[2:47:36] <%jiggy_snipe> geez

[3:49:50] <+pectusumbra> Touch the untouchable. Shake the unshakeable. BREAK THE UNBREAKABLE ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWER
[3:49:51] <MaverickJoker> didn't Woolie already serve his time as a play tester?
[3:49:51] <%heroversusofficial> It's all smart play until Woolie does dark and takes them
[3:49:52] <theturtlesnatcher> com
[3:49:52] <+MrAtheGreat> The players are pac-mans and the towns are pellets. WAKKA WAKKA
[3:49:53] <Jrocy247> This risk is NOT high, Because Woolie can become a Darkling guys
[3:49:57] <powerprotoman> woolie consider the following if your gonna darkling towns dont mean shit
[3:50:15] <Klefth> Also, you may want that lost technology
[3:50:16] <+Pookiedaexzile> Woolie is doing Johns
[3:50:18] <+nintega010> Darkling resets everything
[3:50:21] <+Pookiedaexzile> He's doing a Johns
[3:50:22] <+InfiniteHav0k> It wont matter once you use darkling
[3:50:22] <Brutalyte616> Minh is bullshitting you SO hard right now.
[3:50:24] <theturtlesnatcher> darkling you COWARD
[3:50:26] <+xx123manxx> lost tech not worth rn
[3:50:27] <Jrocy247> If Woolie became a Darkling. IT RESETS EVERYTHING
[3:50:28] <%heroversusofficial> Darkling
[3:50:29] <%purplehermit12> Lost tech is actually good for him, so it'd be nice.
[3:50:32] <%feiashtear> lost technology god please
[3:50:36] <debrv> Go for it Wools!! Lost Techo!!
[3:50:39] <+Pookiedaexzile> THIS IS WHY HE GETS BLOWN UP
[3:50:41] <Maleicus> LuvSnooze
[3:50:42] <starwolfgang> If you're gonna darkling, just go deeper in the shrine to get good equipment
[3:50:43] <+Piemen99> DArlington dont back down!!

[3:50:48] <+nekodelic> Woolie is doing the thing they talked about in the podcast, isn't he?
[3:50:52] <Jrocy247> Lost Tech would be something that's REALLY worth it
[3:51:01] <metabot64> sparking in MVC3 LUL
[3:51:08] <debrv> @jrocy247 It reallly REALLY is.
[3:51:12] <$legacy0117> Wait, I thought of some serious collusion move....But should I say it?
[3:51:18] <%NWannabe> @Jrocy247 sure...then someone steals it from him or he darklings and loses it
[3:51:19] <+Pookiedaexzile> If anyone ever loses to Woolie again knowing he has the mentality of Don't hold down back in GRand Finals
[3:51:24] <$legacy0117> Asking.
[3:51:27] <+Pookiedaexzile> You deserve it
[3:51:28] <DXLelouch24> Woolie your in last place,this isnt a fighting game its designed to help you
[3:51:45] <Jrocy247> @NWannabe You can't steal his Darkling bat away from him
[3:51:48] <+MrAtheGreat> I see Woolie’s auto-recovery strat was taken directly from KOTOR 2
[3:51:53] <%KnivesEve> was this a full day of dokapon?
[3:51:53] <%jiggy_snipe> the only thing Woolie is missing out on right now is grinding but they are all weak right now
[3:51:55] <metabot64> No woolie do the bad thing real life IS a fighting game
[3:51:56] <+b_aleph> munny

[3:52:14] <mdkcde> NOt enough
[3:52:19] <+InfiniteHav0k> deeper into the cave
[3:52:20] <%NWannabe> How does that help Woolie?
[3:52:26] <+gutlesscoward> if you go to the magic space, you have a 50% shot at hitting the item space (a 2,4, or 6)
[3:52:26] <$legacy0117> I suppose I'll say.
[3:52:29] <%gatorafan> Don't you need a contract for Darkling?
[3:52:30] <+pectusumbra> get that fat chedda
[3:52:31] <%NWannabe> That ain't playing to win, @Jrocy247
[3:52:32] <Brutalyte616> ...Wait, can you send bad shit to the King under someone else's name to piss him off?

[3:53:26] <%heroversusofficial> GET OVER HERE! (But also please maintain a responsible 6 ft distance thanks)

[4:09:42] <%jiggy_snipe> nice
[4:09:45] <reonome> chaching
[4:09:53] <+pectusumbra> even if things don't pan out, you can get out of there and get new gear, get huge
[4:09:57] <emperordread> Then Woolie can double down on the gold bug - that'd be huge
[4:09:58] <KRaZyAmmo> gotta get the cash gotta get the dough

[4:10:18] <%NWannabe> and did that floor havea store?

[4:10:29] <Kidbizzaro> STRIKE FROM THE SKY BROTHERS
[4:10:31] <+pectusumbra> Yes, the contract takes everything and moves you to the dark space by dokapon castle
[4:10:31] <%purplehermit12> @NWannabe yup, which is why he should either have gone for the lost tech or immediately use the contract
[4:10:42] <%Hawkbone_> Alright, I've been gone since Reggie got to the new continent. Any interesting developments? Besides Woolie getting the contract.

[4:38:41] <yeetdabsenpai69> BUT THEY DIE
[4:38:43] <+agumon9000> Beef up, get towns, Beat a red boss, and boom. You can go back later
[4:38:47] <dastmwolf> guess the content part doesn't apply here
[4:38:51] <Jrocy247> Hey, look at the BRIGHT SIDE. Woolie came out with POCKETS FAT
[4:38:53] <%feiashtear> Weak
[4:38:55] <+TechnicolorNinja> Good try.

[4:39:07] <%Livelinne> PJSugar
[4:39:07] <$legacy0117> Daw....
[4:39:08] <berasite> but woolie, they dont heal LUL
[4:39:13] <+kekkerscrew> Go back later when you don't get oneshot by the creatures down there
[4:39:18] <%purplehermit12> Woolie, they dont heal + the monsters are level 40
[4:39:22] <light_aeolus> Revival?!
[4:39:23] <yeetdabsenpai69> they dont heal and have to fight
[4:39:23] <+gutlesscoward> and now they'll never come back and forget about it
[4:39:26] <%Urdunngurdunn> they don't heal like you, Woolie
[4:39:27] <CaramelTaffy> also you could summon then warp so they are trapped while you take towns
[4:39:28] <+agumon9000> RED
[4:39:31] <preppyposs> RED CHEST
[4:39:32] <+Pookiedaexzile> Woolie isn't built for this game

[4:39:33] <berasite> BrokeBack woolie big plays
[4:39:34] <+agumon9000> F
[4:39:38] <+xx123manxx> they get stuck underwater = have to get item to leave or walk all the way back = you tping out and getting all the towns

[4:39:51] <+agumon9000> 👍 Ya did good woolie. You filled dem pockets
[4:39:53] <aloveidiots> 🔑
[4:39:54] <Jrocy247> @WoolieVersus Thank you for Trying Woolie, we all appreciated
[4:39:59] <vVAstrAVv> you know whats contemt. using that damn contract lol
[4:39:59] <%feiashtear> Depressed
[4:40:00] <Brutalyte616> Woolie, you have successfully bitched out. Congratulations.
[4:40:03] <Xeno351> KEY
[4:40:03] <preppyposs> YOU MADE SO MUCH CASH THO
[4:40:06] <+Pookiedaexzile> Woolie finna explain his way into losers bracket
[4:40:08] <crimsonsaens> Death Call is still really good to
[4:40:09] <+pectusumbra> Made lots of money
[4:40:09] <debrv> yeah wools. you can come back later.
[4:40:13] <dapperskeleton69> so what did woolie get from the white space?
[4:40:16] <berasite> Don't trust woolie to do good decisions, he used KO charm while using lance
[4:40:16] <SethKyu> Holding tech through 3 classes to master ( monk, mage->Alchemist) probably wouldn't have been smart anyway
[4:40:18] <COMB711> death call
[4:40:20] <%gatorafan> now get the good weapons Wools
[4:40:21] <Jrocy247> Death Call
[4:40:21] <%purplehermit12> Not just the card game
[4:40:22] <+gutlesscoward> he got a death call
[4:40:25] <+pectusumbra> You were never gonna get that much money punching monsters
[4:40:28] <dapperskeleton69> neat
[4:40:29] <%purplehermit12> You also had collected from ALL your towns
[4:40:35] <%purplehermit12> It wasnt just the card game
[4:40:36] <$legacy0117> Now, whatever you do, don't get killed.

[4:45:29] <Sedrelic> it was nice,see ya next stem
[4:45:36] <+iamwood99> dokapon is now imbedded in his brain
[4:45:40] <vVAstrAVv> whats this blood pool and how do i give lol
[4:45:41] <%jiggy_snipe> it might mess up the schedule tho
[4:45:45] <+that_Mojo_Izakku> just have to whisper scream for hype moments
[4:45:50] <+xx123manxx> just....one...more....turn
[4:45:53] <%Hawkbone_> Dokapon is 100% the best LP ever imo
[4:45:56] <%FuqBoiSlim> !donate
[4:46:01] <%purplehermit12> I love this series
[4:46:02] <%FuqBoiSlim> nvm
[4:46:12] <$legacy0117> I got a lot of writing to do it seems. x3
[4:46:20] <+NecDW4> This was a fucking rollercoaster of an episode
[4:46:21] <theturtlesnatcher> this was my first live stream and it was a blast
[4:46:30] <%purplehermit12> Reggie made some big plays
[4:46:39] <theturtlesnatcher> REGGIE GANG
[4:46:40] <%gatorafan> KOTOR > Dokapon but the later is still super good, one of the best manga arcs
[4:46:44] <%Livelinne> Can’t wait for the anime recap
[4:46:45] <hamahiroyuki> the golden bug... bug. eyyyy
[4:46:52] <%TheOneUpWarrior> salt parties are always hype
[4:46:56] <berasite> LUL game mechanics in your favor? in dokapon
[4:47:09] <+agumon9000> POCKETS
[4:47:09] <+pectusumbra> Go spend it
[4:47:12] <+xx123manxx> Just invest in stocksuh gear
[4:47:12] <reonome> POCKETS
[4:47:13] <%purplehermit12> Okay but you can turn that into real value
[4:47:13] <SethKyu> Money is not safe, true
[4:47:14] <coldfire0007> Invest
[4:47:14] <@Solidus_113> Kappa
[4:47:17] <%Hawkbone_> Reggie can kill Woolie and take it all
[4:47:17] <Jrocy247> POCKETS
[4:47:18] <topendbuzza> time to invest it woolie
[4:47:23] <Brutalyte616> Minh with that item tech, but don't forget his ass is still stuck in the Lost Woods.
[4:47:25] <%purplehermit12> @WoolieVersus Invest it, buy gear, etc.
[4:47:27] <%gatorafan> should have used the golden bug
[4:47:28] <berasite> You can lose towns too @WoolieVersus
[4:47:34] <berasite> LUL
[4:47:35] <Camail> but you have a chance of making it rich
[4:47:36] <%jiggy_snipe> you need new gear
[4:47:37] <%purplehermit12> you can lose towns too LOL
[4:47:40] <AnacondaVirtue> Are you saying you're not confidant in the POCKETS lifestyle, Woolie?
[4:47:48] <SethKyu> Hopefully, you can get a dope weapon before that happen, though
[4:47:50] <%heroversusofficial> @WoolieVersus You're gonna be wearing the freshest suit and battlefist though
[4:47:52] <%purplehermit12> NOT TRUE
[4:47:54] <%Hawkbone_> Yet.
[4:47:55] <topendbuzza> weapons
[4:47:55] <%purplehermit12> There's PLENTY OF GEAR
[4:47:55] <+xx123manxx> if you buy good enough gear you'll never lose it Keepo
[4:47:58] <Jrocy247> Muted
[4:47:59] <+paladinstarbuster> it wonly be worth it if you stayed for the lost tech
[4:48:00] <+gustavozxd> this almost sounds like a real life conversation LUL
[4:48:05] <+kekkerscrew> You got the Fashion Magazine
[4:48:07] <%TheOneUpWarrior> you live by the bug, you die by the bug
[4:48:20] <%Urdunngurdunn> You could lose literally any and everything in this game
[4:48:21] <theturtlesnatcher> the bug is the best content arc
[4:48:23] <+pectusumbra> they all take on %, but it's never that much
[4:48:28] <%Hawkbone_> Remember when the King spent your money for no reason?
[4:48:30] <patrickIy> Too much money problems LUL
[4:48:38] <%TheOneUpWarrior> FUCK RPS KID
[4:48:41] <%gatorafan> first world problems
[4:48:45] <Klefth> The gold is the least you can get underwater. Let's just put it that way
[4:48:49] <SethKyu> Town's aren't even safe either, you can lose them, or the can go back to level 1 through events
[4:48:51] <theturtlesnatcher> rps kid best stand user
[4:49:00] <%purplehermit12> You could literally lose anything, this is the nature of dokapon. your towns can be lost, your money can turn into gear which helps you fight which means you wont die often which means you wont LOSE MORE
[4:49:01] <Jrocy247> And it let Reggie catch up with yall too
[4:49:04] <$legacy0117> So there characters are set, and fate has given Dio his Stone Mask, and access to his Devil Trigger.....What shall he choose?
[4:49:04] <berasite> You can lose towns too woolie LUL nothing is permanent in this game
[4:49:06] <%gatorafan> and Reggie was grinding by avoiding fights as much as possible Kappa
[4:49:10] <Brutalyte616> Actually you can dump however much money you want at a castle that you own, then go back and take it out later.
[4:49:13] <topendbuzza> weapons time
[4:49:13] <Fujiwara_92> but do it tho 4Head
[4:49:14] <%TheOneUpWarrior> hes like a living boulder blocking your path
[4:49:20] <reonome> life is temporary
[4:49:24] <reonome> dokapon is forever
[4:49:27] <%jiggy_snipe> it wasn't as bad as the Wabbit is the point cuz you got somethig
[4:49:38] <%heroversusofficial> Go invest in gear and go back
[4:49:47] <+xx123manxx> just bea good enough gear to have a chance to kill shit down there so you'll be good
[4:49:51] <+xx123manxx> buy*
[4:49:55] <+pectusumbra> could have stayed and bounced a bit.
[4:49:58] <%purplehermit12> You wouldnt be able to use it yet, but later on you absolutely would @WoolieVersus
[4:49:59] <berasite> Can lose castles too LUL is hard to lose that towns
[4:50:04] <berasite> but it can be done
[4:50:08] <theturtlesnatcher> honestly whatever you do im in this great to watch
[4:50:10] <%TheOneUpWarrior> woolieDATTEBAYO
[4:50:17] <%gatorafan> once the monsters of the deep stop being scary you can go back
[4:50:33] <%TheOneUpWarrior> SHINING FINGAHHHH

[4:50:58] <%heroversusofficial> But still mad beta
[4:51:08] <Brutalyte616> "Look! The East is burning red!"

[4:51:11] <@Solidus_113> http://www.thevs.co/download.html
[4:51:19] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[4:51:33] <%Urdunngurdunn> Woolie should go get the lost tech after he masters hand to hand combat and the rules for equivalent exchange
[4:51:46] <%heroversusofficial> woolieGASM
[4:52:11] <SethKyu> If they go for lost tech in the future, I hope they get a skeleton key before hand
[4:52:31] <@Solidus_113> living in the database
[4:52:31] <reonome> the future is now
[4:52:33] <OkamiDude15> he's become a ghost in the shell
[4:52:34] <%heroversusofficial> Thats some .hack// shit right there

[4:56:07] <%Livelinne> @woolieversus you can handle FPS cameras? Cuz I can’t.
[4:56:12] <%Urdunngurdunn> Why does Woolie use a heat hawk and not a beam saber.
[4:56:19] <berasite> LUL
[4:56:24] <@Solidus_113> Woolie Quests
[4:56:43] <%Hawkbone_> Something Sidequest?
[4:56:46] <%heroversusofficial> @WoolieVersus I demand Custom Robo battles
[4:56:55] <berasite> we got an intro alredy, so might as well workshop it
[4:57:01] <%TheOneUpWarrior> lmao Puzzle gundam breaks into 750,000,000 pieces and they all act like fin funnels including the cockpit

[4:59:55] <%Hawkbone_> Atlus owns Dokapon
[4:59:57] <Mrthefro> Getting countered while Life will Chane plays
[4:59:57] <+pectusumbra> Wii kind of gave it a strong casual vibe and it's kind of dirty since people think of shovelware
[5:00:01] <+Dorf1> armello is like this but not as funny

[5:01:56] <%TheOneUpWarrior> he uses the self flagellation to shirk the focus
[5:02:08] <$legacy0117> Ty for streaming guys. ^^ This was a much less anger inducing match it seems.
[5:02:08] <%jiggy_snipe> Reggie thinks he's playing 5d galatic chess
[5:02:10] <theturtlesnatcher> hiding in plain sight
[5:02:12] <%TheOneUpWarrior> and then STRIKES
[5:02:14] <%kyh9> Reggie using peak reverse psychology
[5:02:26] <+pectusumbra> Woolie is gonna pull out a foot picture, take a deep huff, then go Shaggy Blanco at some point
[5:02:29] <theturtlesnatcher> "planned" ahead
[5:02:32] <+agumon9000> Thursday!
[5:02:34] <%TheOneUpWarrior> no hes gotta reverse reverse psychology
[5:02:36] <%rubbishbinge> You're not stepping on Reggie, he WANTS to be stepped on

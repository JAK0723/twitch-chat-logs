[0:17:08] <+croxeye> that's a good deal tho?
[0:17:10] <Infinit_Phoenix> idk a skeleton would be bones clacking and wooshing
[0:17:15] <TigerClaws12> they have to, else Riot is gonna kill it
[0:17:26] <MattDemers> The more attached to a character they are, the longer they spend playing and the bigger the audience is.
[0:17:28] <SomersaultJustice> it's wolly time
[0:17:29] <+jiggy_snipe> I would like to try that
[0:17:34] <MattDemers> Riot is going to absolutely MERC all current fighting games.
[0:17:37] <+Superbro64> I did think you would take that deal
[0:17:41] <+Superbro64> SeemsGood
[0:17:47] <otakon17> So...F2P but you have to buy all the alt outfits with no preview?
[0:17:52] <nothuzad> the easier sunk-cost-fallicy is able to trigger to better for their bottom line profits V:
[0:17:55] <otakon17> I.../think/ that could work
[0:17:58] <+Superbro64> @otakon17 correct
[0:18:05] <otakon17> ugh
[0:18:14] <arkv01> fuck that man I can change titty size for free in honey select
[0:18:14] <otakon17> THAT however is bullcrap
[0:18:21] <Solidnick18> so disgusting
[0:18:21] <+Superbro64> alts are consumables, have to buy to change every time, ala doa6
[0:18:26] <otakon17> A dollar to change hair color
[0:18:34] <MassConnect> I can't remember the last DOA I bought
[0:18:37] <%gatorafan> and if you buy too much hair dye your hair gets destroyed right? Kappa
[0:18:42] <+Superbro64> reminder that core fighters doa6 IS FREE
[0:18:42] <otakon17> oh if only
[0:18:44] <arkv01> change her hair color or get apple pie at mcdonalds? hmm...
[0:18:46] <+Superbro64> funnily enough
[0:18:50] <%linSP> Tf2 has you pay 5 bucks to dye your hat tho like 7 years ago
[0:18:55] <otakon17> DoA6 is $60
[0:18:58] <otakon17> Nioh 2 oh
[0:19:00] <Solidnick18> nioh 2 Kreygasm
[0:19:06] <otakon17> the last chance demo is SO goddamn hard
[0:19:09] <arkv01> I mean tf2 is mostly insane people, no offense to you nutters
[0:19:09] <nothuzad> nioh 2 character creator Kreygasm
[0:19:16] <otakon17> least I found it hard and I played the CRAP out of Nioh
[0:19:24] <mitochondria_ph> Who's Moopoke? moopokThink
[0:19:27] <otakon17> a bot
[0:19:29] <%Lion_kun> If it was so good, theyd dump the stamina bar and excessive gear stats
[0:19:30] <otakon17> a mod bot
[0:19:32] <+Ondartyr> THey gotta get that blubber
[0:19:35] <otakon17> do not anger the mod bot
[0:19:36] <arkv01> what about... softening gel bikini
[0:19:36] <Solidnick18> yep
[0:19:41] <CaptWeirdo> Hey Woolie
[0:19:42] <+Bear_Mane> I need more gel
[0:19:43] <+jiggy_snipe> I think Riot's model with LOL is very good for the most part except for a couple things
[0:19:50] <otakon17> I want a LoL RPG
[0:19:55] <+Superbro64> I thought the sales in X3 would FUND doa6, to be honest
[0:19:58] <lewzino2000> Yoooo woodie
[0:20:15] <+jiggy_snipe> so you need to be able to unlock the characters in game and it not be a huge hassle
[0:20:15] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:20:33] <+Superbro64> Consumables or no deal doodSinwata @woolieversus
[0:20:36] <+thereisneverenoughdakka> @otakon17 everyine wants that because then you get to play lol without other people
[0:20:44] <%gatorafan> I need to board consumables daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:20:48] <Solidnick18> yeah
[0:20:53] <mitochondria_ph> Only consumable that is ok is CSGO stickers since people can sell those back for real cash of using it themselves if they want.
[0:20:54] <Jaku2011> I'd take hard microtransactions in exchange for rollback any day of the week
[0:20:54] <+Hunterv96> how we gonna get that RECURRENT user spending then? make new content?
[0:20:55] <%gatorafan> *hoard
[0:21:01] <arkv01> is the lootbox... soft?
[0:21:04] <+Superbro64> gotta take your sugar with medicine woolie
[0:21:30] <+jiggy_snipe> @Hunterv96 make new colors and skins. New characters will be created over time. Literally the LoL model
[0:21:38] <mitochondria_ph> Consumable only exist because devs want a sink hole for items.
[0:22:02] <%linSP> Poe does loot boxes with themed cosmetics each season, but you can also buy cosmetics they always sell
[0:22:22] <+Hunterv96> @jiggy_snipe i think that's too much effort for the poor devs how are they gonna get food on the table?
[0:22:34] <%gunsrlove> doom eternal next week, just saying

[0:23:37] <nothuzad> 3 days mitochondria_ph
[0:23:42] <Jaku2011> I'm honestly fine with doa's million costumes the cast has at least 5-8 costumes each that are in the game without paying the hair stuff was a step too far
[0:23:48] <HorribleHog> Imagine warframe but with playstyle-dependant loot, shoot a leg, drops parts for pants, chop off an arm, drops parts for gun
[0:24:10] <+jiggy_snipe> @Hunterv96 maybe, I wouldn't know if you can successfully apply one genre's model to another genre but it's worth a try since Riot is rolling in cash
[0:24:25] <anar_bael> podcast hours before game time
[0:24:38] <mitochondria_ph> usually I would be mad about million costumes in fighting games, but I think DOA gets a pass just because it's DOA and nothing else
[0:24:43] <%linSP> What does the S strand for???
[0:25:03] <otakon17> HorribleHog, so THE SURGE?
[0:25:13] <Solidnick18> lol
[0:25:14] <otakon17> Like, I love how The Surge handles loot
[0:25:17] <TigerClaws12> whoa
[0:25:21] <nothuzad> S stands for Supper
[0:25:24] <otakon17> if only the rest of the game was polished
[0:25:26] <worldbrand> the S in S club seven stands for seven
[0:25:27] <%gatorafan> oh I saw a few chapters of that. I wasn't that much of a fan and kinda forgot about it
[0:25:27] <HorribleHog> otakon17 yeah but good
[0:25:32] <otakon17> The Surge is okay
[0:25:36] <+Mythicalbrit> does woolie have the new update early?
[0:25:39] <otakon17> I haven't played Surge 2 though
[0:25:49] <nothuzad> Mythicalbrit new update is out?
[0:25:56] <+Mythicalbrit> nah comes tomorrow
[0:25:57] <nothuzad> -?
[0:26:00] <donstylo> The Surge 2 is a very good game

[0:35:37] <Louie_Salmon> How old is that save? Because they definitely changed up a lot of early stuff
[0:35:37] <kingbaconcrispy> Hades is still hell Darlington, always with the devils games.

[0:36:04] <%linSP> Zag time
[0:36:04] <arkv01> BlessRNG we're BACK IN (Ultimate Christian Storm 3)
[0:36:06] <sunsetserenity1> @louie_salmon The save is from April 2019
[0:36:10] <Saltmeisterr> unfortunately we probably aren't going to see fists
[0:36:13] <Skeletonmanners> its the narrator from Bastion again
[0:36:21] <spacecatstreams> honestly, might as well stick with a new save file
[0:36:24] <%derap41> Very low dialoge
[0:36:27] <otakon17> Yo, Woolie should give Curse of the Dead Gods a shot when he gets the chance
[0:36:27] <arkv01> suck it dad!
[0:36:31] <Saltmeisterr> its a pretty late unlock it seems
[0:36:36] <%derap41> To bad we can freaking hear it

[0:36:58] <Saltmeisterr> fun fact, Zag's va is Darren Korb
[0:37:01] <+kyh9> Bastion, Pyre and Transistor always had inexplicably soulful VA work
[0:37:02] <otakon17> so, Supergiant is made fo hyper talented VAs
[0:37:08] <dethette> so's orpheus
[0:37:09] <Saltmeisterr> the composer for SSG
[0:37:15] <joylent_blue> news alert, the Supergiant team is talented as FUCK, more at 11

[0:39:13] <EndgameContent> So glad Woolie's playing this
[0:39:14] <VidulaSaix> Hades is a cool game for sure but I actually feel like it's the weakest of their titles
[0:39:25] <Saltmeisterr> nooo
[0:39:35] <spacecatstreams> we're all darren korb fans here i suppose. woolie is the tastemaker.
[0:39:37] <critfumble_> SUCH A COOL DESIGN
[0:39:38] <Saltmeisterr> i say pyre is but i love pyre
[0:39:42] <dethette> holy shit that updated boon effect
[0:39:42] <Solidnick18> this athena
[0:39:43] <EndgameContent> I think it's their strongest technically and their most replayable,
[0:39:44] <arkv01> wuz good cuzzz
[0:39:46] <otakon17> Athena is hot
[0:39:47] <Quantumsheep1> I'd agree it's the weakest, but it's also not done yet so
[0:39:49] <Tisaric> nah, as much as I love Pyre it's still the weakest to me
[0:39:51] <%RioGascar> Thats like half life episode 1 being the most weak of valve
[0:39:51] <Aracon_> chocolate athena
[0:39:52] <VidulaSaix> So when's Kratos 4Head
[0:39:54] <%gunsrlove> everyone is hot
[0:39:56] <+kyh9> These designs are SMT-tier
[0:39:57] <+Emperor_Bad> is that boobo
[0:39:59] <arkv01> yo dont hate on PSYCHO BALLl
[0:39:59] <DatAsuna> Lady Palutena!
[0:40:00] <EndgameContent> But back-to-forward it's a bit weaker narratively than Bastion or Transistor
[0:40:01] <%RioGascar> its still fucking good
[0:40:02] <TigerClaws12> NotLikeThis
[0:40:06] <TomFrank> dash
[0:40:06] <%NerevaRising> DASH
[0:40:07] <otakon17> and make them DEFLECT
[0:40:09] <akman14> Fuck you dad!Is the plot of this game.
[0:40:11] <reonome> oh shit hades! did woolie get the latest update?
[0:40:12] <arkv01> speedrun tech
[0:40:16] <EndgameContent> The art in this game is amazing
[0:40:19] <Saltmeisterr> dash is still op lol
[0:40:20] <TigerClaws12> always Athena dash
[0:40:24] <spacecatstreams> divine dash always great
[0:40:39] <arkv01> nothing like a good nut busting i-frame
[0:40:40] <%gunsrlove> Athena Dash beats the game every run
[0:40:44] <FuqBoiSlim> damn character art is sick in this.
[0:40:46] <Quantumsheep1> I don't think you can even talk about Hades' story right now, it literally doesn't even have an ending yet
[0:40:51] <%ironohki> Corgo500
[0:41:07] <Saltmeisterr> SourPls
[0:41:07] <dethette> jen zee's art is like. perpetually breathtaking

[0:42:23] <%RioGascar> Powerline adaptor
[0:42:24] <Tisaric> @metabot64 powerline adapters
[0:42:24] <EndgameContent> Supergiant is way smaller than you'd expect after playing any of their games.
[0:42:26] <%RioGascar> Im pretty sure
[0:42:26] <Saltmeisterr> i wanna see MEG
[0:42:28] <bear_breaker20> cool cool, I underestimated how much support theyd be giving this one
[0:42:35] <metabot64> @chat thx

[0:42:51] <Tisaric> gunslinger is so much fun
[0:42:51] <masheshardest> Missed the green challenge chest
[0:42:51] <Saltmeisterr> theres been like8 major updates
[0:42:53] <EndgameContent> Even if you only end up playing for an hour, I'd recommend picking up a copy of Hades just to support the studio.
[0:43:04] <%The_Timo> awww hell yeah
[0:43:16] <EndgameContent> I remember not being too crazy about Pyre but I still bought it because I wanted to play whatever Supergiant was going to make next.
[0:43:19] <Mr_Rakjo> Yes
[0:43:20] <%gunsrlove> DISAPPOINTEEEEED
[0:43:20] <%gatorafan> Zeus FUCKS

[0:43:22] <Dapper_Cactuar> YEP
[0:43:24] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> YES
[0:43:26] <Mr_Rakjo> Zeus is a SLUUUT
[0:43:27] <dethette> i always appreciated supergiant but watching the noclip docuseries just made my respect for them skyrocket tbh
[0:43:27] <spacecatstreams> and then he taught me about the dangers of atheism
[0:43:28] <Saltmeisterr> YES
[0:43:28] <%Razputin217> disaPPOINTED
[0:43:28] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> ZEUS WAS HORNY ON MAIN
[0:43:33] <Iwashi94> disa-PPOINTED
[0:43:34] <%The_Timo> often as animals
[0:43:35] <bear_breaker20> he zues he sets the welfare rates afterall
[0:43:36] <Saltmeisterr> he's a fuckboi
[0:43:38] <Solidnick18> ZEUS
[0:43:44] <GenericTwitchAcc1> Zeus fucks anything with a holw, and often times things that don't
[0:43:44] <%RioGascar> disneys hercules was also somewhat accurate
[0:43:47] <arkv01> zeus is the admin for the furaffinity forums man
[0:43:50] <%RioGascar> Sorta

[0:43:55] <Iwashi94> LUL
[0:43:56] <spacecatstreams> wow
[0:43:57] <FuqBoiSlim> Zeus would definitely wear an ahegao hoodie if be could
[0:43:57] <joylent_blue> DAMN
[0:43:57] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Zeus more Chad than Dante

[0:44:04] <MillaMoks> Zeus was so horny that one time her decided, fuck all that time consuming sex and shit imma turn into a raincloud and just direcly impregnated a bitch via wate-semen
[0:44:04] <dethette> all human misery arises because zeus horny
[0:44:07] <MillaMoks> he*
[0:44:08] <MayorRev> come on in to MADDEN TOWN
[0:44:13] <%Razputin217> Zeus FUCKS EVERYTHING

[0:44:17] <%FrostedZaibatsu> hggGOOFY He fucks
[0:44:24] <MayorRev> hang with us we won't let you frown
[0:44:24] <fist_wizard_jay> Woolie was your dad Zeus?
[0:44:25] <Tisaric> there's so many smart design decisions for how the rougelike elements work,
[0:44:26] <Saltmeisterr> this room has weird lighting
[0:44:29] <Dapper_Cactuar> Zeus turned into a swan to seduce the spartan queen. Dude's a freak
[0:44:30] <%MrMoonGoose> fyuck
[0:44:30] <Tisaric> I love it
[0:44:46] <%ironohki> Woolie: don't fuck that up. Also Woolie: *fucks that up*
[0:44:48] <%RioGascar> zeus has weird fetishs
[0:44:50] <Saltmeisterr> don't forget yer special
[0:45:01] <%RioGascar> lots of impreg fetishs in many wierd manners
[0:45:07] <EndgameContent> Every Supergiant game has an amazing quantity of amazing voice acting
[0:45:14] <%ironohki> @RioGascar All of mythology is everyone telling zeus not to stick his dick in it, and then zeus sticks his dick in it.
[0:45:20] <Tisaric> SourPls
[0:45:20] <critfumble_> pots with gold in them are explicitly gold coloured now
[0:45:20] <%gunsrlove> money in urns needs to be unlocked
[0:45:21] <+Jaysky> Wouldn't turning into a swan to get with a queen mean that the queen is a freak?
[0:45:21] <GenericTwitchAcc1> Zeus has no fetishes because he has all of them
[0:45:22] <otakon17> Zeus, screwer of anything on two legs
[0:45:24] <dethette> the vases w/ gold in them are shiny and don't show up til you buy them
[0:45:27] <Saltmeisterr> SourPls
[0:45:34] <EndgameContent> I'm actually curious to see if Zag is voiced by the same dude that does the rest of their amazing voice acting
[0:45:43] <EndgameContent> Rucks is easily on the level of the Darkest Dungeon ancestor.
[0:45:46] <+AnimeNerd25> Definitely saving up for this game.
[0:45:46] <Tisaric> Zag is voiced by Darren Korb
[0:45:49] <Saltmeisterr> he's voice be the composer
[0:45:50] <bear_breaker20> Hey guys SOMEONES gotta come up with all them mythological monsters, Zues is your man
[0:45:54] <Tisaric> he also does the Skelly voice
[0:46:01] <Saltmeisterr> and Orpheus
[0:46:05] <dethette> @EndgameContent not all of the va work but he's also skelly and orpheus
[0:46:06] <Tisaric> Logan is the Narrator

[0:46:54] <EndgameContent> I'm actually surprised by Skelly though, but dude's got range.
[0:46:55] <FuqBoiSlim> e p i c
[0:47:06] <Saltmeisterr> dash on A DansGame
[0:47:12] <%linSP> Can you feasibly beat this game on your first run?

[0:47:19] <Saltmeisterr> yes
[0:47:25] <Saltmeisterr> if ur gud enuff
[0:47:27] <%ironohki> Doctor: "Sire, the queen has given birth to a monster!" Labyrinth guy: KomodoHype
[0:47:28] <Doodle_Taco> Had to go away chat, what did I miss?
[0:47:32] <%gunsrlove> @ironohki not really all of it, but Zeus does get around.... mostly no one tells him anything about his sexing except Hera

[0:47:57] <+kyh9> qt

[0:50:31] <anar_bael> hooded is placeholder art @woolieversus
[0:50:32] <EndgameContent> It's neat how they implemented the purple currency (whatever it's called) into her design
[0:50:35] <%FrostedZaibatsu> Shadow Mami hggGasm
[0:50:45] <%gunsrlove> @woolieversus She is the mother of death technically
[0:50:46] <+aishman> @EndgameContent It's just Darkness
[0:50:56] <reonome> Mommy nyx Kreygasm

[0:51:25] <+kyh9> Pure SMT-tier stuff right here
[0:51:32] <EndgameContent> The little zig-zag thing that Hades's mustache is shaped after.
[0:51:33] <+yehdinh> Jen Zee is a god-tier artist
[0:51:34] <dethette> fun fact: chaos is nyx's parent
[0:51:37] <%MrMoonGoose> But doggo tho

[0:51:58] <%gunsrlove> nyx is the mother to a bunch of things, death and sleep, the keres, the first titans and the earth itself
[0:52:14] <EndgameContent> @spacecatstreams I wonder if it's based on anything, though.
[0:52:15] <GenericTwitchAcc1> fun fact: Nys has given birth to a lot of gods at this point and still hot
[0:52:17] <rbakervv> pet the dog
[0:52:20] <Quantumsheep1> Socrates died by drinking hemlock, or so the story goes
[0:52:32] <%MrMoonGoose> pet the dog
[0:52:39] <+yehdinh> Awwww I just saw sleepy Hypnos
[0:52:43] <GarbageNirvana> I wonder if the narrator is supposed to be Homer
[0:52:45] <Tisaric> oh neat
[0:52:51] <Saltmeisterr> @Quantumsheep1 this game has a joke about that
[0:52:52] <Tisaric> that's a nice way of changing the mirror
[0:52:54] <reonome> new mirror time
[0:52:56] <%Ipsenscastle> You can get really far on your first go
[0:53:18] <dethette> oh hey sweet ui tweaks
[0:53:22] <%gunsrlove> Greater Reflex Kreygasm
[0:53:25] <+Deft_Thought> I'll be excited to watch a 0 death speedrun of this game a month after the full release 4Head
[0:53:28] <Vashido22> @WoolieVersus is this your first time playing the game?
[0:53:31] <Solidnick18> oh cool
[0:53:45] <Vashido22> Oh they changed the mirror a lot
[0:53:46] <GarbageNirvana> They played it last year
[0:53:47] <Vashido22> neat
[0:53:51] <nothuzad> Vashido22 no he just hasnt lpayed in like 10 months
[0:53:51] <VidulaSaix> LUL
[0:53:58] <Tisaric> It's insane that this game already felt so damn polished yet each new update is like polishing it up even more
[0:53:58] <spacecatstreams> it's fiiine
[0:54:00] <%GeneralSCPatton> The magic of a Rogue-LITE
[0:54:03] <bevyrage> has there been an issue with the audio for anyone else? wanna confirm it's my comp or not
[0:54:13] <Vashido22> @Tisaric SuperGiantGames are gods at this point
[0:54:17] <Doodle_Taco> @bevyrage Its fine for me
[0:54:18] <+Crimznking> This on steam yet?
[0:54:24] <bevyrage> = v =]b
[0:54:24] <nothuzad> it is Crimznking
[0:54:24] <dethette> do they still have free darkness respec?
[0:54:29] <Louie_Salmon> But usually the game also gets harder as you upgrade.
[0:54:35] <+Crimznking> @nothuzad sweet
[0:54:48] <anar_bael> please woolie when you get thr chance try out the gloves
[0:54:51] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Is this just Little Nicky?
[0:54:52] <+kyh9> Hercules' Girlfriend?
[0:54:53] <FuqBoiSlim> I'll take it easy when I'm dead
[0:54:55] <+penndra> oh this game is so pretty
[0:54:56] <GenericTwitchAcc1> monkaS oh no, not the Meg
[0:54:56] <Louie_Salmon> Oh, Woolie probably doesn't know about how the first boss has a bunch of hard variants
[0:54:59] <GarbageNirvana> Not like death means much around here anyway
[0:55:02] <Saltmeisterr> its not free anymore
[0:55:03] <TigerClaws12> a e s t h e t i c c s
[0:55:15] <GarbageNirvana> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli no shut up
[0:55:22] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> It is
[0:55:23] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> think about it
[0:55:25] <%gunsrlove> Why did Disney make Meg Hercules' girlfriend
[0:55:34] <GarbageNirvana> Shut up tho
[0:55:34] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1237401882802429957
[0:55:38] <Saltmeisterr> @Louie_Salmon he has to beat the game first to see that
[0:55:47] <+Crimznking> This a fresh start
[0:55:55] <Saltmeisterr> ZOOS
[0:55:58] <reonome> new vfx PogChamp
[0:56:00] <Doodle_Taco> Yo chat does Persephone shows up?
[0:56:01] <Tisaric> Like, the boons didn't need to be animated, but they polished it up this patch
[0:56:06] <dethette> i really love that new boon visual
[0:56:07] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> ZEUUUUUUS!
[0:56:08] <Tisaric> it's insane
[0:56:09] <GenericTwitchAcc1> Horny Incarnate
[0:56:09] <%gunsrlove> ZEEEEUUUS
[0:56:10] <otakon17> THERE he is!
[0:56:10] <Saltmeisterr> @Doodle_Taco NOO
[0:56:13] <otakon17> Unca Zeus!
[0:56:15] <spacecatstreams> bruuuuuce
[0:56:17] <TigerClaws12> rad uncle
[0:56:18] <Solidnick18> ZEUSSSSSS
[0:56:18] <LoveYouDead> Tartarus ? * Persona 3 music starts playing *
[0:56:20] <VidulaSaix> ZOOOOOOOOOOOOOS
[0:56:20] <reonome> @Doodle_Taco spoilers ;)
[0:56:21] <%Razputin217> ZEUUUUSSSSS
[0:56:23] <%alrobot2014> i don't trust uncle
[0:56:24] <Saltmeisterr> at least not yet
[0:56:27] <+DRAGKUDO> English accents
[0:56:27] <Doodle_Taco> @saltmeisterr Shame, she cool
[0:56:27] <dethette> king of the chads
[0:56:28] <otakon17> You know what this reminds me of? Hercules' Adventure
[0:56:29] <+Bluemanzee> Zues put some clothes on please
[0:56:30] <gekizenbu> absorb Zeus' sperm for power
[0:56:35] <%FrostedZaibatsu> BBZ
[0:56:38] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @kyh9
[0:56:41] <%gatorafan> Zeus probably wants to fuck you
[0:56:45] <Saltmeisterr> @Doodle_Taco she's part of the story tho
[0:56:47] <topendbuzza> is this a new save?
[0:56:49] <otakon17> Watch the allcaps
[0:56:53] <spacecatstreams> they're tryna fuck with your dad
[0:56:54] <Quantumsheep1> New save, yeah
[0:56:55] <Doodle_Taco> @saltmeisterr Oh neat
[0:57:00] <+Crimznking> Zeus is our drunk uncle with sunglasses and a Pontiac Firebird
[0:57:05] <GarbageNirvana> Zeus is like "would if I could"
[0:57:07] <EndgameContent> It's all about that family drama
[0:57:11] <otakon17> I can't wait till Ares or Hephaestus shows up to give you a boon
[0:57:13] <FuqBoiSlim> @gatorafan Incestuous AND getting in it early? Zeus cant get any lower
[0:57:13] <+jiggy_snipe> it's family drama
[0:57:14] <EndgameContent> Y'all ever seen Knives Out?
[0:57:15] <gekizenbu> the greek gods are famously fickle
[0:57:19] <Saltmeisterr> wait till yall see Dio
[0:57:22] <+kyh9> "your dad is such a dick and never calls, come hang out with your cool uncles and aunts on mount olympus"
[0:57:25] <Doodle_Taco> Was Zeus the primordial coomer?
[0:57:31] <%linSP> Cool uncles tho
[0:57:31] <dethette> the olympians don't know about persephone yet
[0:57:34] <spacecatstreams> its a family drama and I want to date one of my cousins
[0:57:34] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:57:36] <Tisaric> No Hephaestus yet but Ares has boons
[0:57:38] <RushUnplugged> @EndgameContent just watched it 2 days ago, fantastic movi
[0:57:46] <otakon17> I say Chain Attack
[0:57:48] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Seath: LIGHTNING!
[0:57:49] <Shardlab> Even the gods you think are cool can be wrathful SOBs
[0:57:50] <Tisaric> unless I'm misremembering who the hammer is from
[0:58:05] <RushUnplugged> hammer is from Daedalus
[0:58:09] <EndgameContent> "Day or night" is one of my favorite running gags in this.
[0:58:11] <Saltmeisterr> Daedalus
[0:58:17] <Tisaric> yeah ok no Hephaestus then
[0:58:38] <dethette> the best joke imo is how zag finds out abt his mom
[0:58:41] <FuqBoiSlim> this on consoles yet?
[0:58:44] <Saltmeisterr> we are still missing Apollo and heppy
[0:58:48] <Shardlab> Not yet
[0:58:52] <%Ipsenscastle> Art by Jen Zee
[0:58:53] <%The_Timo> as it is in all their games
[0:58:54] <Tisaric> probably not on consoles until 1.0
[0:58:55] <%ironohki> @FuqBoiSlim It still technically early access.
[0:58:56] <Shardlab> Still in early access on PC
[0:59:02] <spacecatstreams> maybe we'll get hestia
[0:59:04] <ZComiX> is this game done or syill in beta
[0:59:09] <Vashido22> it barely feels like an early access though
[0:59:09] <Saltmeisterr> i thought this update was 1.0
[0:59:10] <GenericTwitchAcc1> the chain lightning is on your ranged attack, Woolie
[0:59:12] <Vashido22> its so polished
[0:59:12] <Louie_Salmon> Didn't you get the lightning on your cast?
[0:59:13] <dethette> early access
[0:59:14] <EndgameContent> This game has always been the cleanest early access title
[0:59:14] <Rhinoprotoss> Isn't the chain lightning on the cast?
[0:59:15] <FuqBoiSlim> they're planning to put it on consoles though right?
[0:59:17] <+Typhaeon> I've always found that Supergiant has struggled to transform their very unique, detailed 2D artstyle into 3D (see: Pyre). They've really upped their game with Hades though
[0:59:22] <Vashido22> @FuqBoiSlim once its done yeah
[0:59:30] <spacecatstreams> this isn't 1.0 but they said it's scheduled for 2020
[0:59:32] <FuqBoiSlim> alright cool
[0:59:33] <EndgameContent> These guys are the Bastion enemy
[0:59:34] <Tisaric> 1.0 is late this year by current plans
[0:59:42] <TheoTTree> Oh man I'm glad to see Woolie playing this
[0:59:43] <topendbuzza> still waiting on a transistor lp by woolie
[0:59:51] <EndgameContent> I really hope this game is super successful, Supergiant deserves it.
[0:59:51] <Vashido22> @Typhaeon I still like how Pyre looks, but this indeed is a massive step up
[0:59:53] <RushUnplugged> basically just missing the ending cutscene for it to be 1.0, the game is extremely playable
[0:59:58] <dethette> the numbskulls are basically squirts
[1:00:05] <RushUnplugged> (and yet getting more updates for content)
[1:00:14] <Vashido22> true
[1:00:15] <Akett> Thew fact that you can't fall in a gap is 50% of why I like this game more than Wizard of Legend.
[1:00:18] <Vashido22> BEST ARES
[1:00:18] <TigerClaws12> surf uncle
[1:00:18] <+aishman> Aries is pretty strong
[1:00:19] <Saltmeisterr> this a bunch stuff from their past games
[1:00:19] <Shardlab> Dionysus is the best
[1:00:19] <topendbuzza> got an update today one hour ago
[1:00:26] <+aishman> There is
[1:00:26] <Saltmeisterr> BLADE RIFTO
[1:00:27] <+Typhaeon> The Demeter update or thereabouts brought a lot more detail to some enemy models
[1:00:28] <TheoTTree> Dionysus is a good boy
[1:00:29] <+aishman> CHAOS
[1:00:32] <Vashido22> Surf uncle Poseidon is STRONG
[1:00:36] <%gunsrlove> MEG Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:00:38] <xemeas> ares is cool
[1:00:41] <Shardlab> Poseiden is so cool
[1:00:44] <Saltmeisterr> CHAOS
[1:00:44] <Quantumsheep1> I'll be disappointed if all they have left for the ending is a cutscene, it's a bit underwhelming right now imo
[1:00:46] <GenericTwitchAcc1> Kreygasm Thanatos
[1:00:51] <RushUnplugged> countdown to the guys being horny for Meg, start now
[1:00:51] <Tisaric> This game really feels like they took aspects from every other game they've made and made a super rougelike with them
[1:00:52] <masheshardest> @WoolieVersus Don't forget about your cast
[1:00:54] <MamadHunter> Dusa is best girl
[1:00:59] <reonome> gold is only in shiny pots
[1:01:08] <dethette> sea storm's a run winner tbh
[1:01:09] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus The gold doesn't appear in urns anymore till you get the upgrade for 'em now. Also you'll know which one they are as they shine gold.
[1:01:10] <Shardlab> Dusa is extremely cute
[1:01:11] <Solidnick18> Posiden is cool
[1:01:13] <+Despera__> Gold is only in gold pots
[1:01:23] <Vashido22> @WoolieVersus Gold only appears in golden urns now
[1:01:23] <spacecatstreams> i can't wind for woolie to find [redacted] on the second floor. best girl.
[1:01:25] <Tisaric> I doubt the ending will just be a cutscene, they very rarely do cutscenes in their games
[1:01:32] <otakon17> I wonder if DIonysus will get added and give you status effects like making the enemies "drunk"?
[1:01:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> @shardlab Dusa is best waifu.
[1:01:36] <Saltmeisterr> hell this update just added a pact option that turns elites into Men's from Transistor
[1:01:47] <Tisaric> Dionysus is in and does have wine based boons
[1:02:07] <Tisaric> but it's more like poison than "drunk"
[1:02:16] <dethette> dionysus gives people hangovers
[1:02:16] <otakon17> aw
[1:02:21] <reonome> its called hangover now
[1:02:23] <otakon17> I was hoping for hiccuping enemies
[1:02:27] <EndgameContent> This game's all about mixing and matching
[1:02:29] <Vashido22> pah!
[1:02:30] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus They've added changing the rooms that can spawn. Later on you'll even be able to make fountains, rooms that are safe that JUST give you health appear. But you have to unlock the builders to do so
[1:02:33] <MamadHunter> they actually re-flavored the poison to hangover
[1:02:34] <Louie_Salmon> Oh Woolie wouldn't know about the DUO boons either, right?
[1:02:34] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:02:36] <Solidnick18> but they get mad if you pick someone else i think
[1:02:38] <Saltmeisterr> Dio's poison keeps getting its name changed
[1:02:40] <RushUnplugged> you can mix and match god boons to make crazy combos
[1:02:41] <Saltmeisterr> its weird
[1:02:42] <EndgameContent> But seeding works in a way where you're going to only see a handful of gods per run
[1:02:43] <Louie_Salmon> Man there's so much cool shit they added
[1:02:43] <Quantumsheep1> Stacking status effects is the meta
[1:02:48] <Shardlab> Dionysus makes people hallucinate and alcohol poisoned. Too much of a good thing
[1:02:51] <spacecatstreams> i don't really like how they changed his cast from tipsy shot to trippy shot. tipsy is much more fitting.
[1:03:02] <+Typhaeon> RIP Nasty Dash
[1:03:04] <Rhinoprotoss> They tell you what you get on the doors
[1:03:10] <otakon17> aye, Tipsy
[1:03:11] <Dapper_Cactuar> also some gods don't like it when you take boons from certain other gods
[1:03:11] <Tisaric> ah I miss nasty dash
[1:03:16] <masheshardest> The blue cauldron is a mini shop
[1:03:21] <Saltmeisterr> huh weird seed
[1:03:28] <GenericTwitchAcc1> the chance is also weighted toward gods yo already have boons for
[1:03:36] <Saltmeisterr> no they change woolie
[1:03:38] <dethette> sometimes it's the hoppy bois
[1:03:43] <Tisaric> nah they're all fine with each other, there's just duo boon rooms that piss off the other god you don't pick first
[1:03:46] <Louie_Salmon> There's a few variations, but there is always a mini-boss
[1:03:47] <nothuzad> mini bosses can change - bosses "cant"
[1:03:49] <Saltmeisterr> and u can skip them sometimes
[1:03:52] <Shardlab> It's not inevitable to face them
[1:03:56] <reonome> close one there
[1:03:58] <Shardlab> Just very likely
[1:04:00] <Tisaric> Once you get through the duo boon room no one cares
[1:04:05] <Akett> God, boons look so good.
[1:04:07] <+aishman> HJOLTED
[1:04:10] <GenericTwitchAcc1> Woolie played this when there was only 1 miniboss encounter pretty sure
[1:04:10] <Saltmeisterr> JOLT
[1:04:13] <+aishman> JOLTEd-ah darn
[1:04:15] <spacecatstreams> all zeus all day
[1:04:17] <dethette> rip jolt
[1:04:17] <emeraldskrull> I just finished transistor. I liked it
[1:04:21] <RushUnplugged> did they just update the boons icons?
[1:04:26] <reonome> yes
[1:04:28] <Saltmeisterr> Yes rush
[1:04:30] <Vashido22> they sure did
[1:04:41] <+Crimznking> ah man the jolt
[1:04:53] <Vashido22> I like the new ones, but I'm so used to the old ones that its still weird
[1:04:56] <TigerClaws12> mob absorbed it
[1:05:13] <reonome> woolie should really get jolted
[1:05:19] <reonome> although he's probably gonna die first LUL
[1:05:39] <+aishman> Oh money time
[1:05:47] <FuqBoiSlim> 3 hp MonkAss
[1:05:55] <+aishman> And there's the placeholder
[1:05:56] <spacecatstreams> dang, could have got food
[1:06:02] <+kyh9> talk to charon
[1:06:04] <Vashido22> last placeholder right?
[1:06:07] <Saltmeisterr> rip no health
[1:06:09] <+aishman> Yeah
[1:06:12] <Tisaric> man I love the instrumentation Darren used for this soundtrack so much
[1:06:15] <Tisaric> there's a fucking THEREMIN
[1:06:17] <Saltmeisterr> maybe hope for Sisyphus?
[1:06:19] <reonome> charon's gonna look so cool
[1:06:20] <Vashido22> they teased his official look in the trailer though
[1:06:23] <Vashido22> and I CAN'T WAIT
[1:06:24] <+aishman> @Vashido22 Everyone got art now except for Charon
[1:06:32] <+kyh9> whatcha buyan
[1:06:33] <Vashido22> @aishman Nyx looks so goooood
[1:06:41] <Quantumsheep1> Heal in next room if he can live
[1:06:41] <dethette> oh zaggy of plenty
[1:06:43] <+aishman> She does! I'm so glad she finally got her art done
[1:06:44] <Saltmeisterr> wait did they @Vashido22 ?
[1:06:50] <Vashido22> @Saltmeisterr ye
[1:06:55] <masheshardest> Athena
[1:06:56] <reonome> athena
[1:06:56] <TigerClaws12> that's athena
[1:06:57] <Saltmeisterr> show me lol
[1:06:58] <Vashido22> you can see it at the end
[1:07:03] <spacecatstreams> lvl up for current boon vs new boon
[1:07:06] <Saltmeisterr> ok
[1:07:10] <+aishman> The middle thing lets you level up your boons.
[1:07:13] <Vashido22> @Saltmeisterr check the latest trailer, right at the end
[1:07:20] <Saltmeisterr> thx
[1:07:30] <spacecatstreams> fuck them shades
[1:07:33] <dethette> the shades are just chillin
[1:07:35] <+Despera__> Deflect dash is great
[1:07:38] <Vashido22> just vibin
[1:07:39] <+kyh9> double hell
[1:07:44] <reonome> they're already dead its fine
[1:07:52] <RushUnplugged> athena dash keeps getting nerfed and it's still the best boon
[1:07:54] <Shardlab> Do your own time, not someone else's.
[1:08:04] <+Typhaeon> Nyx has new art? Been a while, have to see that
[1:08:08] <GarbageNirvana> you're just sending em back home
[1:08:10] <GenericTwitchAcc1> they have time, they'll get it eventually :)
[1:08:11] <Saltmeisterr> @Vashido22 oh shit ur right
[1:08:15] <Vashido22> athena's dash is practically hard to nerf, the concept itself is good
[1:08:16] <Saltmeisterr> he look cool
[1:08:20] <Vashido22> @Typhaeon she does
[1:08:21] <reonome> F
[1:08:24] <+kyh9> f
[1:08:26] <Solidnick18> Dah
[1:08:26] <Vashido22> F
[1:08:27] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus Something to note, when enemies have armor they don't stagger, the moment that's gone you can stun-lock 'em into death
[1:08:28] <+CavemanInCave> got em
[1:08:28] <FuqBoiSlim> F
[1:08:39] <dethette> wait if you hit the shades are you just giving hynpos even more work to ignore

[1:09:10] <otakon17> Achilles!
[1:09:11] <%Ipsenscastle> FOR REAL THOUGH, HE'S SAYING THAT BECAUSE IT'S TRUE
[1:09:12] <Shardlab> Hypnos throws so much guileless shade
[1:09:12] <Saltmeisterr> hypnos is 4Head incarnate
[1:09:13] <GenericTwitchAcc1> simply move out of the way 4Head
[1:09:13] <Vashido22> Just don't get hit 4Head

[1:12:07] <spacecatstreams> first one for free
[1:12:11] <otakon17> SO you can get new chambers in every run
[1:12:12] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus Remember how there was fountains and gold in urns? They took that out and now you have to use these people to get them into the runs

[1:12:50] <Tisaric> the squirts and these little shades are so cute
[1:12:51] <+aishman> Gold in URNS is gone till you unlock them
[1:12:55] <Louie_Salmon> Basically, those are something you work for now.
[1:12:57] <dethette> gems have been a thing
[1:12:58] <Saltmeisterr> the shades are just squirts at this point
[1:12:59] <startstoprepeat> it's permanent upgrades, making it a bit more rogue legacy-esque
[1:13:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> And cosmetics!
[1:13:09] <GenericTwitchAcc1> drapes PogChamp
[1:13:12] <Louie_Salmon> And that health one is free, and nice.

[1:15:16] <Vashido22> shhhhhh
[1:15:18] <ScreamLord> Hades is a good husband that loves his wife and has a giant 3-headed dog named Spot

[1:15:22] <dethette> nyx is stepmom

[1:15:29] <Vashido22> shhh chat
[1:15:38] <RushUnplugged> @WoolieVersus don't worry about upgrades, the points are refundable
[1:15:38] <Personified134> guys thats literally not a spoiler Woolie has played the game
[1:15:39] <+tekman527> I forget, was refunding Mirror upgrades something you unlock later or did they remove it?
[1:15:39] <Tisaric> Woolie hasn't seen the exposition yet
[1:15:40] <Saltmeisterr> lol hades is not a gud hubbo
[1:15:48] <Personified134> they tell you that super early anyway
[1:15:49] <reonome> he hasn't played a lot of it
[1:15:50] <+Typhaeon> Better him than Zeus
[1:15:50] <+DoctorAvens> unlock refunding later
[1:15:55] <+tekman527> Alright cool

[1:16:27] <Vashido22> THE BOY
[1:16:28] <Saltmeisterr> SKELLY
[1:16:28] <Akett> This is hell, I want to watch this, but I also want to play the patch.
[1:16:28] <Tisaric> I can't believe that's Darren still
[1:16:30] <spacecatstreams> god damn paige-bait
[1:16:31] <dethette> SKELLY <3
[1:16:36] <%Razputin217> sipsipGasm
[1:16:36] <reonome> paige is splooshing right now
[1:16:39] <Vashido22> FUN FACT: Zagreus and Skelly have the same voice actor
[1:16:40] <Quent0nius> EY IM WALKIN HERE
[1:16:40] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:16:43] <%GeneralSCPatton> OH SHIT IT'S DAT BOI
[1:16:43] <Fizzxwizz> enough gabbin start jabbin
[1:16:43] <Tisaric> It's insane that Darren is just talking to himself for this
[1:16:43] <Shardlab> Straight up Paige bait
[1:16:46] <GenericTwitchAcc1> the Elder God himself, Skelly PogChamp
[1:16:50] <$Mofirelizard> can anyone smell mustard
[1:17:05] <%ironohki> Is Paige here?
[1:17:05] <fist_wizard_jay> Don’t give up Skeleton!
[1:17:10] <EndgameContent> Do the power shot
[1:17:12] <spacecatstreams> i don't quite get the dash strike on the bow
[1:17:13] <EndgameContent> Gotta time it just right
[1:17:14] <%ironohki> Don't give up Skeleton!
[1:17:15] <Saltmeisterr> unfortunately chat, we probably aren
[1:17:18] <Saltmeisterr> oops
[1:17:23] <Vashido22> @WoolieVersus fun fact: the composer for all the music voices both Zagreus and Skelly
[1:17:24] <Saltmeisterr> sticky fingers
[1:17:27] <EndgameContent> Let go right when he flashes
[1:17:36] <startstoprepeat> dash strike has a slightly faster charge for the perfect release iirc
[1:17:43] <ernie_turbo23> What happen to Liam
[1:17:43] <Jetsfantasy> Bow has a enhanced hit when you flash white
[1:17:50] <dethette> i love the convos where darren is complimenting his own skills as orpheus through zag
[1:17:51] <GenericTwitchAcc1> Jebaited
[1:17:58] <EndgameContent> No it's not...
[1:18:17] <EndgameContent> You'll see a bigger number and the screen will do a thing when you get the power shot
[1:18:18] <+Typhaeon> gotta get a spread shotgun run going
[1:18:20] <Saltmeisterr> dash attack is weird
[1:18:26] <%Ipsenscastle> it's a super key skill that's always been there
[1:18:31] <Vashido22> @dethette "man you're great at singing Darren" "thank you Darren, you too"
[1:18:32] <ScreamLord> Hades is the least shitty of the Greek Gods. Admittedly that's not a high bar to meet but the worst thing he's ever done is kidnap Persephone and (depending on interpretation) tricked her into becoming his wife or convinced her.
[1:18:32] <+Despera__> Dash attack you have to do really quickly
[1:18:34] <Saltmeisterr> spread rail Kreygasm
[1:18:57] <+Despera__> Best item Pog
[1:19:03] <Jetsfantasy> It's %, not flat
[1:19:03] <dethette> "darren you're such a great protag" "why, thank you darren!"
[1:19:04] <GenericTwitchAcc1> chain shot Kreygasm
[1:19:27] <spacecatstreams> rod when
[1:19:46] <Tisaric> holy fuck I just updated and the new mirror is fucking insane
[1:19:54] <ScreamLord> It's kind of funny because in Modern Media Hades is almost exclusively portrayed as basically Satan but Greek
[1:19:55] <Saltmeisterr> new mirror is tight
[1:19:58] <+Typhaeon> That chain shot though
[1:20:02] <Akett> Ooh, new trap plates.
[1:20:09] <+jiggy_snipe> I love when a game incorporates the roguelike this well into its narrative
[1:20:09] <reonome> new mirror is GOAT
[1:20:12] <+Typhaeon> What do people use as a reload key for the Rail on controller
[1:20:14] <Quantumsheep1> I never liked the bow - knockback is crazy strong in this game and I hate to go without
[1:20:14] <GenericTwitchAcc1> Dio PogChamp
[1:20:14] <MamadHunter> DIO
[1:20:16] <Quantumsheep1> DIO
[1:20:18] <+Crimznking> time for Dio
[1:20:19] <Tisaric> they literally added option select for each mirror option
[1:20:21] <+Typhaeon> Hate the default
[1:20:22] <Saltmeisterr> DIO
[1:20:23] <TigerClaws12> Dio PogChamp
[1:20:24] <Tisaric> that's insane
[1:20:25] <masheshardest> You gotta unlock that
[1:20:26] <GenericTwitchAcc1> KONO DIONYSUS DA

[1:20:56] <Quantumsheep1> Oh yeah, bow special with deflect is hilarious
[1:20:58] <+Typhaeon> That's a really good early game ability

[1:27:31] <Vashido22> Very likely
[1:27:36] <+kyh9> Hoy
[1:27:36] <+mankeyfigh> Did Woolie reveal what the original game was going to be?
[1:27:36] <+Crimznking> bounty or tempest
[1:27:41] <austinj24> Knockback special
[1:27:50] <%derap41> Fun fact Poseidon has the most beautiful feet of all Gods
[1:28:05] <+aishman> APHRODITE
[1:28:07] <+cappyd33> aphrodite
[1:28:09] <Saltmeisterr> OH NO
[1:28:09] <illTemperedSeaBass> "Florida Man Uncle Poseidon" is both disturbingly close to his true depiction, and not quite close enough for my liking.
[1:28:10] <spacecatstreams> which heart to choose
[1:28:11] <Dapper_Cactuar> APHRODITE
[1:28:12] <FuqBoiSlim> FEET?! OwO
[1:28:12] <+cappyd33> APHRODITE
[1:28:13] <dethette> knockback can become ridiculously pog with some additional effects + duos
[1:28:14] <+aishman> IT'S YA GURL
[1:28:22] <Saltmeisterr> chat is gonna get HORNY
[1:28:25] <Shardlab> Knockback is crazy good in this game
[1:28:28] <Vashido22> SourPls
[1:28:28] <Quantumsheep1> Knockback is essential, does wonders for crowd control and lets you get wallbounce damage
[1:28:33] <+cappyd33> time for everyone to get super horny
[1:28:33] <%derap41> Bend your knees wave your arms
[1:28:56] <EndgameContent> This part of the soundtrack reminds me of Doom
[1:28:56] <Saltmeisterr> Poseidon is shit on bosses tho
[1:29:08] <%ironohki> "Hang Ten" is when you drop your hands to the side while doing dank surf shit, to look like you don't give a fuck. Your ten fingers are literally hanging downward.
[1:29:11] <ScreamLord> Amazing

[1:30:10] <spacecatstreams> incest doesn't count if you're immortal, right?
[1:30:11] <dethette> reggie's gotta get through ares first
[1:30:13] <%ironohki> ...special pump?
[1:30:13] <+cappyd33> that never stopped zeus
[1:30:14] <%gunsrlove> Fun Fact: Aphrodite is technically a Titan
[1:30:17] <darkocore> Actually not related
[1:30:18] <RushUnplugged> damage AND special effect
[1:30:20] <+aishman> THE GEMS
[1:30:20] <illTemperedSeaBass> "Hello, cousin! Wanna bang?" -Aphrodite
[1:30:20] <Doodle_Taco> Chat quick who is best girl in greek mythology?
[1:30:21] <%Lion_kun> Remember when Kratos had sex with Aphrodite who was technically hiscAunt
[1:30:21] <%ironohki> Special pump from the love goddess, ey?
[1:30:35] <FuqBoiSlim> persephone
[1:30:36] <+cappyd33> persephone
[1:30:37] <+Crimznking> @kyh9 This is greek myth, that kind of warning would probably have th opposite effect
[1:30:42] <dethette> dionysus has. plans.

[1:30:51] <%ironohki> I GOT GUNS
[1:30:53] <dethette> there are guns, yes
[1:30:55] <+kyh9> @tekman527 and then we end up with all the really fucky gods
[1:30:57] <masheshardest> Special
[1:31:01] <%derap41> I got some cans and a 12 gauge
[1:31:02] <s1rcuit> @WoolieVersus there's a gun in this game
[1:31:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> ARRRRREEEEEEES!
[1:31:04] <+kyh9> oh that's cool, her references the enemy that beat him
[1:31:05] <spacecatstreams> i just wanna see my favorite god starting with a
[1:31:08] <ScreamLord> You mean Hermes?
[1:31:12] <DatAsuna> "we can just shoot up in the back" means something different than you think
[1:31:16] <illTemperedSeaBass> @kyh9 Charles II of Spain.
[1:31:25] <nothuzad> Apollo spacecatstreams SeriousSloth
[1:31:27] <illTemperedSeaBass> "He repeatedly baffled Christendom by continuing to live."
[1:31:34] <spacecatstreams> not quite
[1:31:36] <%derap41> Hades is probably the most chill of the gods
[1:31:42] <+cappyd33> nope
[1:31:42] <%derap41> He gets a bad rap
[1:31:42] <+kyh9> @illTemperedSeaBass Befuddled Christianity by continuing to exist
[1:31:46] <FuqBoiSlim> Hades is a saltlord
[1:31:48] <Vashido22> also new UI
[1:31:49] <Vashido22> neat
[1:31:51] <GenericTwitchAcc1> "hey employees, go beat up my son" 4Head
[1:31:57] <nothuzad> hades gets big bad rep even though he is mostly the nicest
[1:32:00] <+cappyd33> coolest dude's probably hermes
[1:32:00] <+kyh9> don't
[1:32:06] <dethette> hades avoided being a dick by staying underground forever
[1:32:22] <Vashido22> Zeus is the biggest dick
[1:32:23] <critfumble_> sometimes worth it if you can have it for a boss room
[1:32:27] <Vashido22> Hades is just vibin underground
[1:32:27] <%derap41> @dethette among of things
[1:32:28] <+cappyd33> he only went up to fuck a god and then came back down
[1:32:29] <Quantumsheep1> My default strat is to get two easily applied status effects with at least one AOE knockback and go to town, the damage buff for 2+ status effects on an enemy is where you get big boy damage
[1:32:32] <ScreamLord> @derap41 Literally the worst thing he's ever done was kidnap Persephone to be his wife because he was desperately lonely.
[1:32:39] <nothuzad> dethette the biggest dick move from hades was him kidnapping his wife
[1:32:57] <%derap41> @ScreamLord and he unlike Zeus even compromised and gave her back for half the year
[1:33:01] <+cappyd33> whats kidnapping if its for love
[1:33:07] <+Crimznking> spread on big enemies to proc debuff before you just wail on them
[1:33:15] <Vashido22> @cappyd33 still kidnapping
[1:33:16] <nothuzad> Persephone doesnt like it in hell
[1:33:16] <Vashido22> but yeah
[1:33:28] <GenericTwitchAcc1> what's a little rape between uncle and niece :)
[1:33:34] <%derap41> And Persephone even liked Hades in the end its her mom that causes all the fuss
[1:33:35] <illTemperedSeaBass> Oof.
[1:33:50] <+cappyd33> zeus just does that all the time
[1:33:58] <dethette> iirc a lot of the stories are misrepresented, i think persephone made the decision to stay herself
[1:34:01] <ScreamLord> @derap41 yup I mean, for the love of anyone but Zeus he named his guard dog "Spot" LUL
[1:34:09] <Shardlab> Oh yeah, Demeter was causing endless winter
[1:34:10] <Vashido22> Didn't Zeus literally fuck as a goose?
[1:34:13] <dethette> or at least initially
[1:34:14] <s1rcuit> is he playing the Steam or Epic version?
[1:34:24] <+tekman527> @Vashido22 Zeus fucked as many things
[1:34:29] <Vashido22> true
[1:34:30] <Saltmeisterr> fists are cool, u essientially charge up ur special by attacking
[1:34:34] <ScreamLord> @Vashido22 As an Eagle I believe
[1:34:35] <spacecatstreams> karen
[1:34:37] <+cappyd33> "didn't zeus literally fuck...." will always be yes
[1:34:39] <FuqBoiSlim> listen bro. I'm all caught up on Lore Olympus. I think I know my Greek myth
[1:34:44] <%derap41> @Vashido22 Nah he turned into a goose and fucked a girl
[1:34:44] <+Typhaeon> When the Karen is the shopkeeper
[1:34:46] <spacecatstreams> ope
[1:34:46] <dan_g_v> Zeus turned himself into a lot of animals to fuck people
[1:34:52] <+tekman527> Pretty sure he impregnated one woman by turning into rainwater
[1:34:53] <Quantumsheep1> Best girl imminent
[1:34:54] <Saltmeisterr> and the speciall is a DP/power geyser
[1:34:56] <GenericTwitchAcc1> @s1rcuit they are literally the same thing :)
[1:34:59] <Dapper_Cactuar> ooh, another Aphro boon
[1:34:59] <+cappyd33> thats his fav sex move
[1:35:00] <critfumble_> incoming 3rd best girl
[1:35:01] <Vashido22> Right, Zeus literally has a song about him fucking on youtube
[1:35:01] <%derap41> His sister wife Hera cursed that girl later
[1:35:02] <Doodle_Taco> @vashido22 I think the fact that the Goose was NEMESIS makes it worse
[1:35:06] <dan_g_v> who was the one who turned into water to impregnate a woman?
[1:35:10] <+kyh9> just go home
[1:35:17] <Solidnick18> Kreygasm
[1:35:17] <dan_g_v> rain water i think
[1:35:23] <+mankeyfigh> Buff
[1:35:26] <dethette> you can wrap up the entirety of human history with the phrase "zeus fucks"
[1:35:28] <+kyh9> Wave of Despair
[1:35:29] <%derap41> @dan_g_v Probably Zeus
[1:35:30] <Vashido22> @dan_g_v also zeus I think
[1:35:31] <+cappyd33> YUP
[1:35:33] <Doodle_Taco> @dan_g_v Zeus was a golden rain if you mean that
[1:35:34] <+kyh9> It's a duo-boon
[1:35:37] <+kyh9> Wave of despair
[1:35:40] <FuqBoiSlim> ApHOEdite Kreygasm
[1:35:44] <+cappyd33> kratos killed them all because zeus fucked too much
[1:35:44] <+Crimznking> wave
[1:35:47] <+Crimznking> ahhhhhh
[1:35:50] <+tekman527> Yup it was golden rain
[1:35:51] <ScreamLord> I know onetime Zeus deguise himself as his latest conquest's husband to fuck her under false pretenses
[1:35:52] <+cappyd33> aphrodite gets a bad rap
[1:35:52] <spacecatstreams> i don't think we need to worry about duo boons quite yet
[1:35:54] <Saltmeisterr> @kyh9 that's not a duo lol
[1:36:06] <+kyh9> @Saltmeisterr oh, thought it was with the blue

[1:36:19] <Saltmeisterr> Meg PogChamp
[1:36:21] <illTemperedSeaBass> I'd consider myself decently knowledgeable on Greek mythology, and the top 3 gods I'd want to spend an evening if forced would be Hephaestus, Apollo, and Hades. Hades is top 3 chill material.

[1:44:08] <illTemperedSeaBass> Regarding Thanatos, it's worth noting that he's the god of *peaceful* death. He's actually pretty chill himself, so long as you don't trap him in burlap sacks or anything.

[1:56:04] <Jetsfantasy> @ironohki We may have taken guns to hell
[1:56:27] <+BionoidLCR> not lance
[1:56:28] <Shardlab> Every other weapon has a mortal counterpart except the rail.... yet
[1:56:36] <%rytyoung> YOU JUST FREED ADAM WTF
[1:56:38] <+BionoidLCR> GUN
[1:56:40] <VoyRising> The new weapon is so good.
[1:56:43] <rosemon5001> check relics?
[1:56:44] <RevenTheLight> Where are the fists tho?
[1:56:45] <dethette> the spear's v pog
[1:56:50] <Virokwet> poor skelly
[1:56:51] <VoyRising> I just beat the second boss with the gauntlets.
[1:56:52] <Louie_Salmon> Lance is fast and has good range, I like it
[1:56:54] <%gunsrlove> Nemesis Sword, damage monster
[1:56:57] <s1rcuit> and all the weapons are super viable
[1:56:59] <Saltmeisterr> He has to play more to get lance
[1:57:02] <Virokwet> shield though
[1:57:02] <Akett> The new weapon added in this patch is REAL Woolie bait.
[1:57:04] <GenericTwitchAcc1> KKona HELL YEAH BROTHER
[1:57:06] <Saltmeisterr> i mean fist
[1:57:07] <dethette> skelly's chillin, he doesn't mind
[1:57:13] <+tekman527> @Virokwet Skelly's fine, just a minor flesh... err, bone wound
[1:57:21] <+mankeyfigh> Sword?
[1:57:21] <heartlesshealer> get those gauntlets!
[1:57:21] <reonome> PUNCH BOY
[1:57:24] <+cappyd33> where are the blades of chaos\
[1:57:25] <%ironohki> PUNCHGOD WOOLIE
[1:57:26] <GenericTwitchAcc1> Grandma's fists
[1:57:34] <+captain_elsewhere> ive seen some insane runs with the shield
[1:57:34] <Saltmeisterr> granny fists
[1:57:35] <%Pigg1yJuffs> Pigg1yJuffs subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Hey there, Woolie. Happy to see some Hades on here. Got a bit of a recommendation for ya. If you got the time, you should check out a web novel called Worm. Been reading it and it seems up your alley.
[1:57:44] <%Pigg1yJuffs> There's my sub anniversary
[1:57:48] <dethette> keepsakes unlock across saves?
[1:57:51] <%gunsrlove> I see that Chaos Egg
[1:57:52] <Iwashi94> Pockets!
[1:58:00] <+tekman527> Imagine getting a boon from Ares, but the person who greets you is Kratos
[1:58:02] <FuqBoiSlim> never stop pushing worm
[1:58:03] <Saltmeisterr> EGG OF CHAOS
[1:58:06] <RushUnplugged> I go get food, come back to woolie being full of stuffs! did he loead an old save?
[1:58:08] <%Pigg1yJuffs> I did that thing ten minutes ago. woolieDATTEBAYO
[1:58:13] <+Despera__> I still don’t understand what the gold lock stuff is
[1:58:15] <%ironohki> Woolie hasn't even watched Avatar The Last Airbender.
[1:58:19] <%GeneralSCPatton> CHAOS CHAOS! I CAN DO ANYTHING!
[1:58:22] <Louie_Salmon> You usually see chaos somewhere on the first area
[1:58:22] <xdeathknightx> power of the BRRRRRTTTT
[1:58:24] <%derap41> Gun isn't best but it GUN
[1:58:24] <GenericTwitchAcc1> diving dick-first into Chaos Kreygasm
[1:58:25] <illTemperedSeaBass> "I HAVE GUN AND ANIME ON MY SIDE!"
[1:58:26] <+Despera__> And I’ve beaten like 6 runs
[1:58:34] <dethette> oh wait i'm a fool, he switched saves
[1:58:34] <Solidnick18> It's fine you got GUN
[1:58:35] <%derap41> yay Robot Owl
[1:58:43] <FuqBoiSlim> @ironohki but he's seen korra hasn't he?
[1:58:48] <Solidnick18> that's amazing
[1:58:50] <+kyh9> They keep adding new dialogue too
[1:58:51] <+Typhaeon> I do best with Shield, very unga much bunga
[1:58:53] <Saltmeisterr> THERES SO MUCH
[1:58:53] <EndgameContent> There's so much dialog in this godsdamned game
[1:59:02] <MamadHunter> there ALOT of unique dialouge
[1:59:03] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:59:10] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus Something they added since you last played is DUO boons. Boons unique to a pair of gods.
[1:59:11] <%ironohki> @FuqBoiSlim I honestly think no. See if you can get him to say.
[1:59:12] <Jetsfantasy> There's a shit-ton of dialogue, I finally exhausted it before the last update but it took a LONG time
[1:59:16] <%gunsrlove> Does Woolie have the Fated List, im not seeing it
[1:59:17] <blocknight1> repeats eventually but there is a LOT
[1:59:29] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah he hasn't built the prophecy thing yet
[1:59:36] <Louie_Salmon> this is an older save
[1:59:40] <illTemperedSeaBass> Not only is there a lot of dialogue, it's GOOD dialogue. Delivered and written well.
[1:59:47] <%derap41> Thought this Gun had Gear Like reload mechanic
[1:59:50] <$LiquidShake83> reggie tell the sonic story again!
[2:00:05] <Louie_Salmon> The grenade is free though, just has a cooldown
[2:00:06] <Saltmeisterr> yo have u guys seen the new sword aspect?
[2:00:08] <startstoprepeat> but they hit real fast, which works really nice with hangover
[2:00:24] <FuqBoiSlim> a full clip did like 3/4ths of the big dude's health tho
[2:00:34] <Louie_Salmon> Hm, I forget if it can
[2:00:39] <FuqBoiSlim> just got finish them off with the grenades
[2:00:40] <%NerevaRising> You're safe
[2:00:41] <+tekman527> Grenades wont hurt you
[2:00:44] <%Pigg1yJuffs> No guns are gonna beat the feel of guns in Synthetik for me. Best roguelite shooter ever.
[2:00:46] <Saltmeisterr> it can if u pick the hammer for it
[2:00:55] <blocknight1> ur safe
[2:00:56] <startstoprepeat> grenade can't hurt you, but there's an upgrade that increases the damage and makes it do friendly fire
[2:00:56] <heartlesshealer> hmm, gun doesn't seem like it would be fun against quick enemies
[2:00:59] <MamadHunter> it wont hurt you, theres a daedalus upgrade that does
[2:01:02] <UnfilteredComic> Nah you want the shotgun blast, a range DECREASE
[2:01:09] <+tekman527> Only enemy explosives and explosives in the environement will hurt you
[2:01:18] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus if you want range increase and the like, I suggest be on the lookout for HAMMER, those are the things that let you upgrade your weapon in unique ways
[2:01:24] <Saltmeisterr> they changed the shotgun hammer
[2:01:28] <EndgameContent> Oh hey, they updated this
[2:01:34] <Saltmeisterr> its now a single shot
[2:01:40] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah the hammer is always great
[2:01:54] <Louie_Salmon> Was hammer around back when Woolie played?
[2:01:55] <+Klonoa__> yeah always go hammer
[2:02:01] <reonome> the hammer is the best upgrade
[2:02:01] <Saltmeisterr> ye hammer is very important for rail
[2:02:16] <Saltmeisterr> i think hammers where at launch
[2:02:20] <+Despera__> Hammer > every other thing always
[2:02:24] <+aishman> THERE IT IS
[2:02:27] <Louie_Salmon> Yeyeye
[2:02:29] <blocknight1> hammer is second only to double boon arguably
[2:02:33] <FuqBoiSlim> LETS GOOO
[2:03:06] <Tisaric> I still take hammer over double boon
[2:03:10] <dethette> where would y'all rank chaos gates in relation to hammers?
[2:03:15] <GenericTwitchAcc1> do combo for big numbers
[2:03:17] <Tisaric> double boon can be really bad for hp
[2:03:19] <dan_g_v> we darksiders now
[2:03:23] <+Despera__> Chaos gate is like 3rd
[2:03:24] <heartlesshealer> -30%
[2:03:25] <%NerevaRising> 30
[2:03:34] <DeathInAB0ttle> 30
[2:03:34] <+tekman527> I usually only take Chaos boons early into my run
[2:03:36] <Solidnick18> that's good
[2:03:44] <+kyh9> armor piercing rounds
[2:03:44] <%CaptainPileDriver> yo, NCR just got cancelled
[2:03:44] <reonome> ARTEMIS
[2:03:45] <MamadHunter> ARTY
[2:03:47] <Saltmeisterr> ARTY

[2:03:52] <+Matt_Made> Oh snap
[2:03:54] <Saltmeisterr> BEST GURL
[2:03:55] <critfumble_> QWEEN
[2:03:55] <+Klonoa__> ayyy those arrows every hit would b sick with arty
[2:03:57] <dan_g_v> New California Republic?
[2:04:04] <+Klonoa__> considering how fast the gun fires
[2:04:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> fucking cannot believe NorCal Regionals
[2:04:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> like, damn that sucks
[2:04:19] <Louie_Salmon> Your shots are gonna deal more than the bomb, with that armor shredding upgrade
[2:04:37] <+Klonoa__> limesMusic
[2:04:53] <+cappyd33> YEAH
[2:04:53] <Fizzxwizz> wife alert
[2:04:55] <Quantumsheep1> Artemis is bae
[2:04:59] <blocknight1> dash is so good
[2:05:02] <%ironohki> Now that's my kind of waifu.
[2:05:04] <Iwashi94> thicc
[2:05:04] <RushUnplugged> the cutest
[2:05:05] <Saltmeisterr> a cootie
[2:05:10] <FuqBoiSlim> PogChamp
[2:05:11] <%derap41> But GUN
[2:05:13] <dan_g_v> she is no thic
[2:05:15] <+kyh9> guns sure are loud
[2:05:23] <RushUnplugged> CRIT girl
[2:05:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> she's a cute
[2:05:26] <GenericTwitchAcc1> thighs Kreygasm
[2:05:27] <Saltmeisterr> arty is very tsundere
[2:05:27] <dethette> she IS a cute
[2:05:31] <Solidnick18> what a cute
[2:05:32] <%Double_Tap_That> Critical cuteness
[2:05:40] <+aishman> Call is the SUPER MODE
[2:05:42] <Saltmeisterr> pressure points is bad don't pick that
[2:05:47] <Shardlab> Devil Trigger
[2:05:57] <%derap41> rapid fire and crit chance is always good
[2:05:59] <%rytyoung> Artemis from always sunny is my only Artemis
[2:06:01] <startstoprepeat> pressure points is good if you've got an athena for the duo
[2:06:14] <dethette> shouldn't pressure points be a bit more worth it with exagryph?
[2:06:14] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[2:06:19] <%NerevaRising> @Saltmeisterr It's actually decent with the gun
[2:06:29] <Saltmeisterr> i guess
[2:06:43] <Saltmeisterr> but support fire tho
[2:06:43] <Quantumsheep1> I've never been a fan of the gun, the range and DPS are meh, it lacks knockback, and reload is annoying
[2:07:00] <reonome> same
[2:07:00] <%derap41> Larger pool less healing
[2:07:03] <+Despera__> Gun is heavily dependent on how you build it
[2:07:06] <Louie_Salmon> Healing is extremely sparse, especially since you haven't built any healing chambers
[2:07:17] <startstoprepeat> i think every weapon has its place except the sword, i could never make that work
[2:07:24] <+Despera__> My best runs have been gun builds with the right spec
[2:07:24] <+aishman> MORE DAMAGe
[2:07:26] <Saltmeisterr> builds in this game get hella crazy
[2:07:26] <+cappyd33> cyclops jerky
[2:07:26] <noyjatat> hi woolie and reggie
[2:07:30] <+Klonoa__> fountain chambers too
[2:07:31] <Quantumsheep1> Healing is rare in this game but you get tanky AF with max mirror upgrades, big healh pool plus three revives
[2:07:36] <reonome> sword gets good with damage boons
[2:07:36] <Louie_Salmon> Woolie doesn't want those TEMP BUFFS
[2:07:38] <+Despera__> Also sword just spam the special lol
[2:07:40] <mMayrro> damn you Karen!
[2:07:41] <%CaptainPileDriver> OH NO, NOT THE KAREN'S
[2:07:42] <RushUnplugged> funny enough my fastest clear is with the gun, hammer buff on special making it a rocket, and the 3x one, everything melted
[2:07:43] <GenericTwitchAcc1> FeelsBadMan
[2:07:43] <%derap41> Karen took the fucking kids
[2:07:49] <+aishman> You also have revives which is rare for most games of this type
[2:07:50] <reonome> fuck the skull room holy shit
[2:07:54] <+Deft_Thought> @Louie_Salmon Sword builds are almost entirely dependent on your Daedalus boons
[2:07:57] <s1rcuit> Cyclops jerky's fucked up because the them and the Olympians are siblings
[2:07:58] <MamadHunter> sword is mostly a stat stick for cast runs for me
[2:08:03] <+Deft_Thought> You can get some goofy builds with it
[2:08:09] <dethette> you really don't want charon to be taking your kids
[2:08:14] <Louie_Salmon> Traps can be very powerful for cheesing enemies
[2:08:23] <RushUnplugged> normal attack with gun is really good to apply status too
[2:08:42] <Saltmeisterr> FUCK U DAD
[2:08:47] <GenericTwitchAcc1> Objective: SURVIVE
[2:08:57] <dethette> squirt room squirt room
[2:08:58] <Louie_Salmon> "My subjects wish to have a word with you" "Ok boomer"
[2:09:28] <+cappyd33> dash
[2:09:34] <Solidnick18> dash
[2:09:38] <Saltmeisterr> Call
[2:09:41] <reonome> dash
[2:09:51] <%NerevaRising> SANDWICH NO
[2:09:52] <s1rcuit> please tell me the divine dash was somehow the best option at the time
[2:10:15] <Louie_Salmon> Of the starting boons, yeah it was pretty much the best
[2:10:28] <JustoAllDay> I love the grenade launcher on this weapon
[2:10:31] <%derap41> So many clicks
[2:10:33] <JustoAllDay> So satisfying
[2:10:34] <+Despera__> It’s good utility
[2:10:38] <s1rcuit> @Louie_Salmon what were the other options?
[2:10:39] <JAW_Skellyman> Hello!
[2:11:07] <+aishman> Or both
[2:11:27] <JustoAllDay> I totally bought Hades because of the podcast
[2:11:29] <JustoAllDay> and boy am I grateful
[2:11:45] <s1rcuit> now that I think about it Athena's not that good on Rail runs
[2:11:50] <GenericTwitchAcc1> pretty meh selection this time
[2:12:29] <dethette> one of my best runs ended up involving the gun, triple mortars, and doom stacking. boom doom moods.
[2:12:32] <+aishman> I was gonna suggest Cast but that works
[2:12:38] <+aishman> IT'S NOT MEG ANYMORE
[2:12:41] <+aishman> IT'S THE OTHER FURIIIES
[2:12:42] <+cappyd33> oh ok

[2:35:25] <+tekman527> COMBO NUMBER
[2:35:26] <Quantumsheep1> In this game do combo is absolutely the path to big number, stacking status effects is the way to go
[2:35:27] <+jennyfurific> thats why you dont shop with less than 200 obol
[2:35:30] <Solidnick18> We do it
[2:35:31] <LeaIsChill> Hydra is about to eat your whole ass for lunch

[2:35:46] <blocknight1> time to jump into the river phlegethon Kappa
[2:35:48] <+mankeyfigh> You fucked up
[2:35:51] <+tekman527> Oh right they updated the Hydra boss in the last patch
[2:36:02] <s1rcuit> such a great idea for a boss
[2:36:04] <Quantumsheep1> I got pretty sick of this boss pretty quick
[2:36:06] <Saltmeisterr> im so glad they sped up this fight
[2:36:08] <Doodle_Taco> Yep
[2:36:09] <+tekman527> Same
[2:36:13] <Saltmeisterr> it got so boring
[2:36:13] <EndgameContent> Aaaaah!
[2:36:16] <%ironohki> Hail hydra?
[2:36:17] <+Despera__> Yeah least favorite boss
[2:36:18] <EndgameContent> So that's why its name is Lernie!
[2:36:19] <+jennyfurific> agreed
[2:36:22] <%Pigg1yJuffs> Yeah, he fought the Lernaen
[2:36:36] <Quantumsheep1> A Supergiant boss without a personality just feels like a waste
[2:36:42] <usurper_sos> ABC always be casting
[2:36:42] <+Despera__> I wish it only had 3 phases
[2:36:43] <critfumble_> there's health pots in the top left and right
[2:36:49] <FuqBoiSlim> that's a lot of health...
[2:36:50] <+tekman527> @critfumble_ not anymore
[2:36:54] <Louie_Salmon> Oh nice they sped this up a lot
[2:36:57] <critfumble_> WHAT
[2:37:01] <blocknight1> i like all the bosses, i didn't really play before he got changed to 2 invulns though
[2:37:03] <Louie_Salmon> Much less health on those heads
[2:37:03] <dethette> okay yeah semantics but since it's greek it's technically heracles
[2:37:08] <reonome> theres no health pots anymore @critfumble_
[2:37:12] <GarbageNirvana> Hydra is rough
[2:37:16] <a_mad_dragon> add boss WutFace
[2:37:28] <%ironohki> Aren't they all add bosses?
[2:37:33] <Saltmeisterr> no
[2:37:34] <+mankeyfigh> He’s fucked
[2:37:37] <s1rcuit> The Rail's a bad match for Woolie because he keeps forgetting about the magazine
[2:37:41] <GarbageNirvana> Like I feel like the hydra can be tougher than some of the later bosses

[2:38:08] <Solidnick18> that was some hades
[2:38:13] <dethette> wonder what input hypnos has
[2:38:21] <Saltmeisterr> meg, hydra, and [redacted] have add phases

[2:53:03] <Shardlab> She's adopted
[2:53:04] <+BionoidLCR> @paladinstarbuster and what? cmonBruh
[2:53:08] <GarbageNirvana> It's in your build stats
[2:53:13] <RevenTheLight> All the god gifts are the same. They give higher chance of meeting those gods
[2:53:13] <blocknight1> most gods just have a trinket that guarantees a boon and increases rarity, good for shaping specific builds
[2:53:14] <heartlesshealer> stats
[2:53:14] <+tekman527> @WoolieVersus The items you get from the gods increase the likelihood of their boon appearing in the run
[2:53:18] <startstoprepeat> trinkets don't show in your codex p sure
[2:53:21] <usurper_sos> Go to stats
[2:53:22] <reonome> whaddaya want
[2:53:40] <DaBigVitus> accept the gift
[2:53:42] <%cobaltlake> I don't think keepsakes are in the codex which is weird
[2:53:43] <DSD24> Did he accept it yet
[2:53:44] <Saltmeisterr> its a keepsake
[2:53:47] <%DensityD> wooliePOYO
[2:53:47] <UnfilteredComic> Keepsakes
[2:53:52] <heartlesshealer> ohh
[2:53:57] <Shardlab> The rose is something you equip from the cabinet near your weapons
[2:53:57] <tigerfang86> its in keepsakes which you can't put on right now
[2:54:02] <reonome> you can't see it now
[2:54:06] <usurper_sos> You have to accept it
[2:54:07] <Jetsfantasy> Accept it first.
[2:54:08] <+aishman> It's a keepsake, you can exchange keepsake between levels
[2:54:14] <%secretspud> It just increases your chance at rarer boons of hers
[2:54:16] <+aishman> Or at the start of the run @WoolieVersus
[2:54:16] <startstoprepeat> it just guarantees aprodite appearing and increases rarity, same as all the other gods
[2:54:16] <FuqBoiSlim> bro its just a little incest. what's the harm?
[2:54:16] <%DensityD> nothing is ever normal on this stream
[2:54:23] <blocknight1> @aishman doesn't have any real renovations yet

[2:57:10] <Quantumsheep1> Spear is strong af
[2:57:14] <dethette> the extend applies to the spin??
[2:57:18] <LeaIsChill> Has Reggie gotten hands on?
[2:57:19] <GarbageNirvana> Tasty
[2:57:21] <usurper_sos> fuck the gun
[2:57:22] <EndgameContent> Gun is really good at applying stacking effects
[2:57:24] <Louie_Salmon> To be fair you got damage here and didn't get it with the gun
[2:57:25] <%derap41> Woolie fucks that gun
[2:57:29] <%secretspud> Gun is only good with the aprodite set up anyway
[2:57:30] <blocknight1> gun's great, just didn't have boons on it yet
[2:57:32] <Shardlab> Y'all havenb't see nthe rocket launcher upgrade.
[2:57:32] <a_mad_dragon> gun needs shotgun upgrade
[2:57:33] <Saltmeisterr> i love da gun
[2:57:33] <tigerfang86> H E S T I A
[2:57:36] <Jetsfantasy> Gun is my least favorite, but it's good with Aphrodite
[2:57:39] <%DensityD> is that a sex move?
[2:57:41] <tigerfang86> Hestia gun is absurd
[2:57:43] <Saltmeisterr> it needs buffs tho
[2:57:47] <Solidnick18> that's a good ass spear
[2:57:49] <%DensityD> "so many ways to play with the spear" Kreygasm
[2:57:53] <Jetsfantasy> The callback can also count as a backstab
[2:58:04] <+Klonoa__> the gun's not bad but woolie got a bad run and the lack of hit stun on enemies make sit tough
[2:58:09] <%ChoculaUltra> Reggie is watching Woolie play with his spear.
[2:58:09] <Graxe_> Gun's good for builds focused on stacking debuffs
[2:58:24] <Shardlab> Gun + Poseiden is godly
[2:58:26] <blocknight1> it's when armor is broken
[2:58:29] <Solidnick18> ZEUSSSSSSS
[2:58:33] <%DensityD> hello did someone order a large platter of STUN?
[2:58:39] <%DensityD> KRATOS
[2:58:40] <+Klonoa__> all melee weps are bretty gun for stuns
[2:58:43] <+kyh9> duo boons
[2:58:46] <Solidnick18> hell yeah
[2:58:47] <+Klonoa__> good*
[2:58:48] <Louie_Salmon> Woolie, you haven't even seen the DUO BOONS
[2:58:49] <Iwashi94> don't you stunlock with everything as long as they don't have armor?
[2:58:50] <RevenTheLight> there is SO MUCH dialog
[2:58:50] <%GeneralSCPatton> DUO TIME
[2:58:52] <+kyh9> it's time
[2:58:53] <dethette> rich coming from zeus
[2:58:53] <LeaIsChill> 2
[2:58:56] <FuqBoiSlim> ZEWEUUUUUUUUS
[2:58:56] <+Klonoa__> no duo rip
[2:58:58] <bear_breaker20> is this game pc only?
[2:58:59] <Solidnick18> DUO
[2:59:03] <blocknight1> too soon for a duo
[2:59:07] <+captain_elsewhere> oh you wait theres some really rare crazy stuff
[2:59:09] <reonome> lightning special
[2:59:13] <Shardlab> For now, it's in early access
[2:59:14] <a_mad_dragon> 10 hours of dialogue
[2:59:16] <Saltmeisterr> duos are green
[2:59:16] <+tekman527> I'd take the Special or Cast
[2:59:17] <Shardlab> So PC only
[2:59:28] <DSD24> Pyre is my favorite Supergiant Game
[2:59:30] <heartlesshealer> it's pretty good
[2:59:32] <+tekman527> Did Supergiant say anything about the game coming to console?
[2:59:38] <dethette> c'monnnn sea storm
[2:59:41] <%secretspud> pyre is just the best, this one's pretty good too
[2:59:43] <+captain_elsewhere> for now Shardlab but all the other supergiant games have come to console
[2:59:48] <Saltmeisterr> i love zeus on special
[2:59:48] <s1rcuit> and it hits twice if you land recall
[2:59:50] <LeaIsChill> Supergiant said after early access which should end this year
[2:59:50] <+Klonoa__> Transistor is still my fav
[3:00:03] <AxelCezar> boupheWoah boupheWoah
[3:00:03] <blocknight1> @tekman527 *apparently* the current roadamap (i.e. next update) is code cleanup which should help with porting
[3:00:04] <Louie_Salmon> @woolieversus You haven't even seen "Duo boons"
[3:00:12] <blocknight1> roadmap*
[3:00:13] <startstoprepeat> imagine cert on consoles would get in the way of their frequent patching, so they'll probably get 1.0
[3:00:19] <critfumble_> for me transistor is untouchable it's my favourite game
[3:00:29] <dethette> that spin is ridiculous
[3:00:30] <blocknight1> transistor is my fave too
[3:00:43] <reonome> one is hermes
[3:00:46] <Shardlab> Oh, I'm counting on it, @captain_elsewhere
[3:00:47] <dethette> that's hermes
[3:00:48] <blocknight1> hades maybe 2nd, still working on pyre, and bastion is good but getting old
[3:00:49] <heartlesshealer> zeus and hermes
[3:00:49] <kragavash> hermes
[3:00:49] <%secretspud> yo spend it
[3:00:50] <+Klonoa__> hermes
[3:00:50] <TigerClaws12> that's hermes
[3:00:55] <UnfilteredComic> That was hermes
[3:01:02] <heartlesshealer> gift hermes if you haven't
[3:01:06] <dethette> JOLT
[3:01:09] <blocknight1> can't gift to shops i think
[3:01:14] <blocknight1> jolted
[3:01:15] <startstoprepeat> jolted big good
[3:01:17] <MamadHunter> Jolted is nice
[3:01:17] <blocknight1> actually eh
[3:01:20] <+aishman> JOLT
[3:01:23] <+tekman527> Jolt
[3:01:24] <blocknight1> dunno if you have +dmg on status yet
[3:01:24] <Solidnick18> Jolt
[3:01:24] <%secretspud> jolt
[3:01:27] <LeaIsChill> Jolted is CRAZY
[3:01:27] <reonome> jolted is so good
[3:01:33] <blocknight1> but its still all right
[3:01:33] <usurper_sos> Jolt is really good
[3:01:40] <spacecatstreams> especially on bosses
[3:01:41] <masheshardest> hermes
[3:01:42] <Solidnick18> hmmm
[3:01:43] <FuqBoiSlim> damn that sounds crazy
[3:01:43] <+코코꾸라> Jolt!
[3:01:44] <+aishman> Hermes just makes something faster
[3:01:44] <+kyh9> Hermes
[3:01:48] <Solidnick18> hermes
[3:01:50] <RevenTheLight> Hermes
[3:01:50] <+kyh9> You ain't seen shit with hermes
[3:01:50] <MamadHunter> hermes and hope for attack speed
[3:01:54] <startstoprepeat> poms never seem worthwhile on anything that isn't hangover damage
[3:02:00] <blocknight1> upgrade would be decent on your attack but boons are just... better
[3:02:05] <%cobaltlake> them calves
[3:02:05] <RevenTheLight> upgrade is better mid-end game or if you have something REALLY good
[3:02:29] <reonome> more dashes is better imo
[3:03:02] <s1rcuit> when did the spear get a dash attack?
[3:03:03] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:03:03] <blocknight1> apparently these newfangled gamers get 3 dashes base now
[3:03:07] <spacecatstreams> a surprising amount of content
[3:03:12] <Quantumsheep1> imo if you can't get to a better position with three dashes then your number of dashes isn't the problem
[3:03:13] <blocknight1> i didn't see that in the patch notes
[3:03:37] <FuqBoiSlim> I think the extra 2 dashes are from perma upgrades
[3:03:48] <reonome> extra 2 dashes are from mirror yeah
[3:03:52] <Solidnick18> melted
[3:03:54] <blocknight1> it was +1 before the update right, i'm not crazy
[3:04:00] <blocknight1> +2 after for 3 total
[3:04:01] <dethette> yup
[3:04:28] <+kyh9> jolt
[3:04:45] <spacecatstreams> anyone remember jolt energy drink
[3:04:56] <dethette> health is the baseline for everything else tbh
[3:05:37] <blocknight1> final shop
[3:05:38] <dethette> more jolt let's go
[3:05:42] <+The_Hand> oh we playing hades? thats hype
[3:05:45] <+kyh9> jolt again
[3:05:50] <Solidnick18> yes
[3:05:52] <usurper_sos> We joltin
[3:05:53] <+kyh9> raw lightning
[3:05:54] <Solidnick18> JOLT
[3:05:57] <+mankeyfigh> I’m never crazy about getting more health in this game
[3:05:58] <FuqBoiSlim> YESSIR
[3:06:10] <+kyh9> Another new fury
[3:06:10] <heartlesshealer> oh boy
[3:06:12] <Saltmeisterr> alecto

[3:06:27] <spacecatstreams> hurt me
[3:06:28] <DSD24> She has cool hair
[3:06:28] <Quantumsheep1> "Now we have a chance of fighting all of them"
[3:06:28] <+The_Hand> i like the one thats insane
[3:06:29] <FuqBoiSlim> oh....fuck...im...gonna....COOOOOOOOOM
[3:06:31] <Shardlab> My first run it was just Meg
[3:06:31] <mistersups> JOLT JOLT JOLT
[3:06:33] <dethette> angery
[3:06:35] <startstoprepeat> i mean, it'll be later that you see "all three"
[3:06:37] <blocknight1> @Quantumsheep1 LUL
[3:06:40] <reonome> don't stick your dick in crazy
[3:06:42] <heartlesshealer> Tormentor of Passions

[3:07:11] <+Klonoa__> rage meter
[3:07:15] <LeaIsChill> mUrDeR
[3:07:16] <FuqBoiSlim> juri han vibes
[3:07:20] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus That's honestly in in-lore reason why they don't hang out in the House of Hades. Only Meg is chill enough.
[3:07:23] <Quantumsheep1> I was really hype to meet them after Meg, too
[3:07:23] <dethette> that jolt is doing so much work
[3:07:26] <critfumble_> lord you're gonna catch me simpin
[3:07:33] <Solidnick18> LUL
[3:07:36] <TigerClaws12> oof LUL
[3:07:37] <Doodle_Taco> LUL
[3:07:38] <dethette> LUL
[3:07:41] <%gatorafan> Olympus doesn't btw
[3:07:45] <usurper_sos> TOPICAL
[3:07:47] <critfumble_> I'm also a juri main okay I know what I like
[3:07:52] <spacecatstreams> poseidon's realm sure as shit don't have M4A
[3:07:53] <%bread_assassin> When they say Medicare for all, they mean ALL.
[3:08:00] <am_omega> Hades in greek myth gets a real bad rep.
[3:08:03] <+cappyd33> adios
[3:08:07] <%NerevaRising> Oh look, MORE TITAN BLOOD
[3:08:08] <startstoprepeat> jolt good
[3:08:08] <heartlesshealer> good job
[3:08:10] <illTemperedSeaBass> Most of the Underworld isn't actually that shitty to live in. It is where ALL dead go, after all.
[3:08:11] <+tekman527> Clap
[3:08:12] <Virokwet> Spinning tops of doom? pfft
[3:08:14] <FuqBoiSlim> it's fine to simp for 2 girls. never for 3dpd
[3:08:14] <%Klefth> What do you think this is, Woolie? America?
[3:08:15] <heartlesshealer> more blood
[3:08:17] <Shardlab> And he makes it into Asphodel
[3:08:20] <Iwashi94> but isn't the lance of longinus Roman?
[3:08:22] <s1rcuit> @WoolieVersus just cuz you're dead doesn't mean you're free of your mental medication
[3:08:24] <dethette> that's like 240 jolt damage per throw
[3:08:34] <Louie_Salmon> Oh he will
[3:08:35] <uchipz> this game looks cool
[3:08:37] <Quantumsheep1> Yeah, this build's going places
[3:08:41] <%gatorafan> Yeah, Hades is super chill but gets shit all the time because he rules the land of the dead, and everyone hates being dead.
[3:08:42] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus Oh sorry man, looks like you don't have the upgrade to change your keepsake on the run.
[3:08:43] <blocknight1> heh magma
[3:08:44] <+cappyd33> did your dad just tell you to kill yourself
[3:08:44] <am_omega> The one time he was a creep he was manipulated.
[3:08:45] <Quantumsheep1> He could beat the game with this
[3:08:47] <%gatorafan> Almost as much as being shot.
[3:08:50] <blocknight1> was lava before update
[3:08:52] <usurper_sos> LUL
[3:09:02] <Louie_Salmon> Well rip that boon upgrade
[3:09:35] <FuqBoiSlim> going uuuuup
[3:09:48] <LeaIsChill> Wait, did he sell Jolted?
[3:09:53] <Virokwet> na
[3:09:55] <+Klonoa__> no
[3:09:56] <FuqBoiSlim> he didnt sell anything
[3:10:00] <a_mad_dragon> it's the hell hell
[3:10:04] <s1rcuit> the SuperGiant art team is fantastic
[3:10:05] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1237401882802429957
[3:10:07] <LeaIsChill> Ah okay, the left side doesn't have it so I got confused
[3:10:19] <crimsonsaens> Has Woolie cleared the game once yet?
[3:10:31] <reonome> don't think so
[3:10:31] <dethette> asphodel used to be a grassy field, the fire river phlegathon overflowed for some reason
[3:10:38] <+The_Hand> when i play spear i pretty much just throw it
[3:10:39] <critfumble_> careful woolie it's a slow and insidious killer
[3:10:48] <+cappyd33> aphrodite
[3:10:52] <s1rcuit> @dethette cuz lolz
[3:10:54] <+tekman527> Aphro
[3:10:58] <FuqBoiSlim> aphrothottie please
[3:11:02] <+The_Hand> spear throw with lightning chain is really strong
[3:11:03] <FuqBoiSlim> I need to see her again
[3:11:04] <blocknight1> more boons are always nice
[3:11:09] <+aishman> Yeah you still have nothing for Dash or Cast
[3:11:10] <MamadHunter> aphro dash is pretty good
[3:11:15] <spacecatstreams> i want [redacted]
[3:11:24] <Quantumsheep1> @WoolieVersus You want another status effect boon for stack buff
[3:11:24] <+mankeyfigh> Upgrade your attack
[3:11:36] <critfumble_> I hope he finds the ! door
[3:11:36] <startstoprepeat> when you're full up on boons you can start swapping them for higher rarity ones
[3:11:37] <+cappyd33> i wonder when we fight arachne
[3:11:56] <dakkster> HYPER COMBO KO
[3:11:59] <crimsonsaens> I consider Poms the worse run limited power-up
[3:12:05] <+cappyd33> NO
[3:12:18] <TheFakeBob> That cast is cool
[3:12:24] <dethette> crush shot is a cast shottie
[3:12:28] <+jiggy_snipe> but you're not using them?
[3:12:44] <Saltmeisterr> charm is trash
[3:12:45] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus Her full max bar super is INSANE. It does so much damage too
[3:12:47] <s1rcuit> that seems useless against bosses
[3:12:47] <+Despera__> Her call is bad
[3:12:47] <heartlesshealer> shop?
[3:12:52] <+The_Hand> i never cast
[3:12:53] <+Despera__> Does now damage unless max
[3:12:54] <%DensityD> which has harsher shadows, Hades or JoJo?
[3:12:54] <dethette> gold
[3:13:00] <%DensityD> or some other 3rd thing
[3:13:04] <heartlesshealer> bye shop
[3:13:06] <spacecatstreams> well now there's a boon for you
[3:13:09] <crimsonsaens> Does he have the mirror upgrade? That's what makes cast so good
[3:13:19] <RushUnplugged> afrodite cast is one of the best, shotgun blast pretty much
[3:13:19] <thewhiterice92> Cast was my first thing I built
[3:13:22] <+mankeyfigh> coin
[3:13:22] <+aishman> @Despera__ In one run I had the boon from Zeus that made the bar fill up faster
[3:13:28] <+aishman> Holy shit I killed everyone with her Call
[3:13:30] <Quantumsheep1> I mainly use cast for applying status effects
[3:13:33] <%DensityD> "I should cast more, but Royal Guard tho"
[3:13:33] <am_omega> Like when I learned about the greek gods I learned that at first Zeus could legit not keep his dick in his pants and is a freak with weird ass fetishes, almost all of the others are massive dicks, and humans are just pawns.
[3:13:44] <dethette> it is
[3:14:00] <+Despera__> @aishman oh yeah if you get some charge synergy then I can imagine it being great
[3:14:02] <+mankeyfigh> Woolie has the hardest time avoiding those wave attacks
[3:14:03] <DSD24> Remember when Zeus was a golden shower?
[3:14:04] <FuqBoiSlim> he jinxed it FailFish
[3:14:08] <thewhiterice92> That sounds right
[3:14:12] <am_omega> Yes.

[3:15:23] <illTemperedSeaBass> @am_omega There are very few gods that aren't complete shitbags. Hephaestus is the chillest fucker on Olympus, Prometheus is cool, Hermes and Apollo, ironically Hades if you're not actively screwing with him, and Thanatos, who presides *peaceful* death, specifically.

[3:16:34] <usurper_sos> Max would be better
[3:16:35] <blocknight1> 5 more health rather
[3:16:36] <a_mad_dragon> max is better in the long run
[3:16:37] <heartlesshealer> Charon talk?
[3:16:41] <blocknight1> max is better
[3:16:43] <am_omega> Its yee-ro I lived next to a crazy greek couple for like 10 years.
[3:16:47] <crimsonsaens> Remember that max life always boosts Death Defiance as well
[3:16:54] <%Pigg1yJuffs> Most of the goddesses in Greek mythology are crazy. The only one that I can think of is Hestia, who is all about family and the home.
[3:17:00] <%DensityD> Link from Zelda wants you to smash those pots
[3:17:05] <%gunsrlove> @WoolieVersus Souvlaki is great until you try Shrimp Saganaki, get on the big boy levels

[3:18:43] <dethette> that room always sucks
[3:18:44] <blocknight1> i always go for the head first
[3:18:45] <heartlesshealer> good job scraping through
[3:18:45] <Jetsfantasy> You can lure him to stomp on lava if you stand right beside it and dash back and forth
[3:18:48] <%NerevaRising> Remember to use your call
[3:18:56] <+cappyd33> you came out of zeus head!

[3:19:08] <+jiggy_snipe> head kid right?
[3:19:10] <blocknight1> ironically that divine dash would have helped you
[3:19:10] <crimsonsaens> Divine
[3:19:12] <crimsonsaens> Dash
[3:19:13] <%Ipsenscastle> she literally exploded out of Zeus' head after some bullshit
[3:19:13] <a_mad_dragon> athena the living headache LUL
[3:19:16] <dellis80> Athena the bro
[3:19:17] <Shardlab> Gestated in her daddy's thigh then burst out of his skull
[3:19:18] <RushUnplugged> Athena, born fully gron from the forehead of Cronos
[3:19:18] <Scyllas> Dash
[3:19:20] <MamadHunter> diddly dash
[3:19:28] <+captain_elsewhere> zeuse had a headache, "break open my head hephestus" out pops athena elaC
[3:19:30] <Torgue_1> Wasn't it Zeus?
[3:19:32] <+cappyd33> she took the braincell and made her godhood just that
[3:19:46] <+tekman527> Athena: "Hey Zagreus did I ever tell you the story of my birth?"
[3:19:50] <Jetsfantasy> Phalanx shot is good too, it sets up a safe area behind it from projectiles
[3:19:52] <Shardlab> Zues took her into his body and she burst from his head
[3:19:52] <startstoprepeat> i like deflect attack on the final form spear
[3:20:13] <am_omega> Yeah, Zeus had a nasty headache and out poped out Athena. Then as usual hera was fucking pisses.
[3:20:16] <FuqBoiSlim> Athena took Zeus' final brain cell. F
[3:20:19] <This_is_Marco> BibleThump
[3:20:20] <UnfilteredComic> funny you mention that
[3:20:20] <Morbidmort> @captain_elsewhere Well that's because he got the goddess of prudence pregnant, then ate her
[3:20:21] <am_omega> Hera is a bitch.
[3:20:40] <Jetsfantasy> You can deflect the waves
[3:20:40] <illTemperedSeaBass> Hera is the worst of the worst of the Greek gods.
[3:20:53] <Shardlab> Hera was reactionary
[3:20:55] <DSD24> Hera hates Heracles so much
[3:20:59] <dethette> herm
[3:21:01] <am_omega> I think part of that was Zeus not helping things.
[3:21:01] <illTemperedSeaBass> Even worse than Zeus, because she targets innocent children.
[3:21:06] <Shardlab> Poseiden and Zues were the Worst
[3:21:06] <AstratesticoMan> run officially jinxed
[3:21:13] <+aishman> It's a NONE COMBAT room
[3:21:16] <+OmegaWeltall> Hera's not the worst, if your spouse was cheating on you 24/7 you'd be pissed too
[3:21:17] <+tekman527> Uh oh
[3:21:18] <+aishman> You chose...CORRECTLY
[3:21:28] <Decsevm> has Woolie announecd what game he is playing for fighting day this week?

[3:21:34] <+cappyd33> wow
[3:21:34] <blocknight1> LUL
[3:21:37] <+LTKonnor> My Greek god lore isn't the best, didn't Zeus just rape everything that moved
[3:21:42] <FuqBoiSlim> oh my god...s
[3:21:44] <MamadHunter> fire is indeed hot
[3:21:45] <%ironohki> Hail Hydra!
[3:21:46] <am_omega> Kinda.
[3:21:48] <+OmegaWeltall> @illTemperedSeaBass ok yea THATS fucked up
[3:21:54] <+tekman527> Pretty much
[3:21:56] <+captain_elsewhere> not everything but a lot LTKonnor
[3:21:58] <a_mad_dragon> zeus got someone pregnant by pissing on them
[3:21:59] <DSD24> Most Greek Lore is pretty rough
[3:22:08] <usurper_sos> Dont forget your charge
[3:22:09] <heartlesshealer> Adds from upper left
[3:22:13] <am_omega> Zeus fucked everything with and without a pulse. He transformed into different animals to fuck women too.
[3:22:24] <%ironohki> An @illTemperedSeaBass is basically what a hydra is. Basically.
[3:22:25] <heartlesshealer> adds summoned
[3:22:25] <Shardlab> Zeus got a lot of poon. Despite being married
[3:22:26] <+mankeyfigh> Ooh jolt is shredding him
[3:22:31] <+captain_history> yeah, ask Europa
[3:22:39] <dethette> with the jolt damage this fight is more than feasable
[3:22:46] <heartlesshealer> get the summoner head!
[3:22:49] <am_omega> If he said "Imma piss on this bitch" then by god he will eventually piss on a woman.
[3:22:52] <illTemperedSeaBass> @ironohki You know... you're not wrong. 🤔
[3:22:53] <crimsonsaens> The red orbs spawn more skellies
[3:22:59] <blocknight1> question is do they lose a life
[3:23:16] <Jetsfantasy> Green sneks are summoners
[3:23:29] <fetrigon> can you cancel out of animations with a dash?
[3:23:36] <Shardlab> Enjoy

[3:24:11] <am_omega> I forget which Deity it was but one time Zeus jizzed on a rock and out popped a god.
[3:24:14] <+cappyd33> YOU LIVE YOU DIE YOU LIVE AGAIN
[3:24:23] <DSD24> Is Death defying a percentage chance?

[3:24:29] <dethette> hephastus?
[3:24:38] <DSD24> I mean Athena sprouted from Zeus's forehead
[3:24:50] <RushUnplugged> @DSD24 it triggers at 0hp and restores half
[3:24:54] <UnfilteredComic> the spear throw has low dps

[3:26:16] <MamadHunter> it's time, time for CHARIOTS
[3:26:17] <%NerevaRising> Now on to the hard part of the videogame
[3:26:17] <crimsonsaens> So is Woolie going for Spent Spirit or has he not heard about Duo/legendary Boons yet?
[3:26:24] <%DensityD> or save money?
[3:26:29] <Graxe_> Onward to Elysium
[3:26:29] <spacecatstreams> i don't think he knows the combos yet
[3:26:32] <+tekman527> Dont think he knows about Duos
[3:26:37] <heartlesshealer> Elysium
[3:26:43] <%DensityD> he lacks critical information
[3:26:58] <crimsonsaens> A mod should link the chart at some point then
[3:26:58] <JeedyJay> Exactly.
[3:27:01] <am_omega> Like if someone said "I am the child of Zeus" you would hear like five people in the crowd go "Oh you too?"
[3:27:12] <%ironohki> Bitches need a support group.
[3:27:14] <blocknight1> you can stand at the cliff to get a voice line
[3:27:16] <%DensityD> PogChamp New Stuff!
[3:27:18] <Virokwet> looky here, we got vegetation.
[3:27:22] <%ironohki> Like megaman bosses who don't have hands.
[3:27:23] <Graxe_> Zagreus has a line if you stand at the cliff there, yeah
[3:27:25] <dethette> the greatest souls who ever lived are all respawning armorbastards
[3:27:27] <+redyoshi5> stand on the cliff

[3:28:08] <Saltmeisterr> remember these enemies woolie?
[3:28:10] <RushUnplugged> @spacecatstreams [redacted] is kind of an asshole but [redacted] is a cool bro
[3:28:16] <Saltmeisterr> from transistor?
[3:28:19] <%DensityD> the colors KappaPride
[3:28:24] <JeedyJay> Such is such a cool game.
[3:28:25] <%ironohki> My friend's little brother used to listen to MC Hammer back in the 80s. And when the song said "It's Hammer Time" he would throw his squeaky hammer toy.
[3:28:26] <dethette> watch out for the butterfly orbs
[3:28:27] <JeedyJay> *This
[3:28:32] <blocknight1> they're elite warriors rather than brute-force enemies so yea kinda
[3:28:36] <am_omega> I need to actually finish Transistor.
[3:28:37] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus They ARE like you, they revive to the nearest big weapon and turn to warriors that use taht weapon
[3:28:45] <heartlesshealer> butterflies represent death and guidance to the afterlife =)
[3:28:48] <Saltmeisterr> they are like bad cells
[3:28:54] <+aishman> Unless you beat their sells
[3:28:56] <%ironohki> God fucking bad cells.
[3:28:57] <+aishman> Er souls

[3:29:40] <MamadHunter> only to armor tho
[3:29:41] <Graxe_> But only to armor

[3:29:45] <+mankeyfigh> SKEWER
[3:29:47] <Virokwet> hmmm
[3:29:47] <JeedyJay> DAT NUMBER
[3:29:48] <%DensityD> psaBig NUMBER
[3:29:49] <usurper_sos> NUMBER
[3:29:49] <blocknight1> it'll help you get through elysium at least
[3:29:50] <+Klonoa__> there's a lot of armor

[3:30:11] <+Deft_Thought> That's not as good as you think it is
[3:30:11] <RevenTheLight> I had to leave for a bit - no FIST yet?
[3:30:12] <TigerClaws12> do combo tho
[3:30:12] <crimsonsaens> All of these are pretty nice, but exploding is bad for Elysium
[3:30:15] <Louie_Salmon> The armor is the most important part to damage. They have no stagger while they have armor, armor is acary
[3:30:20] <dethette> the armor on elysium sucks too
[3:30:23] <TigerClaws12> LUL

[3:31:08] <Louie_Salmon> Well the boss is one room, the enemies are many other rooms
[3:31:08] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:31:09] <crimsonsaens> Woolie isn't going to beat the final boss this run anyway, he might as well grab anti-armor
[3:31:10] <%DensityD> very nice
[3:31:15] <%DensityD> nice reflect
[3:31:18] <%ironohki> Deflect in Bastion was god tier.

[3:33:12] <%cobaltlake> TRIAL
[3:33:16] <heartlesshealer> is that a tiny skull?
[3:33:19] <+Klonoa__> both is good but scary
[3:33:19] <illTemperedSeaBass> Given this takes place in Greek hell, E1M1 is pretty fitting here.
[3:33:20] <+captain_elsewhere> doible doodAnime
[3:33:20] <%DensityD> what kind of food should I get?

[3:33:28] <MamadHunter> not one boon but twoooo

[3:40:14] <+OmegaWeltall> MInos Toros
[3:40:15] <heartlesshealer> born from woman who wanted to get fucked by a bull that was supposed to be a sacrifice to Poseidon
[3:40:15] <Morbidmort> THESEUS

[3:40:20] <arkv01> CUM GET SUM he says

[3:40:22] <%derap41> He was from that Lady that was cursed to fall in love with a bull right

[3:40:31] <%gatorafan> He can destroy me anytime :)
[3:40:38] <crimsonsaens> @RedoctoberWolf That's the infamous minotaur from the maze. He made peace with the guy that killed him after death
[3:40:38] <blocknight1> be sure to learn his patterns
[3:40:39] <am_omega> The king of Minos had a kid, "oh no he is half bull so monster" and threw him in in a maze.
[3:40:43] <usurper_sos> He fights like you!!!
[3:40:50] <heartlesshealer> LEAPS
[3:40:50] <arkv01> OOF
[3:40:51] <spacecatstreams> he can win
[3:40:51] <Louie_Salmon> I wish Woolie would actually use his long attack range in these fights
[3:40:55] <Jetsfantasy> Get dunked on
[3:40:59] <DSD24> Those shoulder tackles
[3:41:06] <dethette> it's always two swings and a jump
[3:41:10] <CureMode666> use the B button
[3:41:19] <%derap41> @am_omega was it Hera that cursed his wife to fall in love with a bull
[3:41:23] <JeedyJay> https://clips.twitch.tv/LivelyTalentedFungusTinyFace
[3:41:30] <blocknight1> he has very clear patterns, at least for the first half yea
[3:41:35] <am_omega> Yeah cause as usual hera was a bitch.
[3:41:55] <dethette> this is going fantastic for a first try
[3:42:01] <%derap41> @am_omega Only because Zeus had already cheated on her with the wife
[3:42:02] <DSD24> pure Strength build
[3:42:09] <%derap41> and by cheated I mean raped
[3:42:10] <Shardlab> Call
[3:42:13] <+tekman527> With every story that begins with "Zeus was horny", every story ends with "Hera got mad jealous"
[3:42:14] <am_omega> Of course.
[3:42:16] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus A word of advice, Aphrodite's call is great but ONLY if you do it with the max bar. Otherwise it's not really worth it

[3:44:26] <+cappyd33> battle rage is spartan rage
[3:44:30] <Morbidmort> BATTLE RAGE
[3:44:32] <MamadHunter> urge is a decent generic boon
[3:44:32] <am_omega> Ohhh that battle rage.
[3:44:35] <startstoprepeat> don't think i've seen battle rage before
[3:44:38] <crimsonsaens> Slicing Shot needs Artemis duo to be good
[3:44:41] <Louie_Salmon> Urge to kill is also good
[3:44:55] <Graxe_> Better not miss that first attack after a kill
[3:44:58] <DSD24> Blood Drunk from the 300 PSP game!
[3:44:58] <+OmegaWeltall> Rip and Tear, untill its Done

[3:46:42] <startstoprepeat> have you tried not getting hit by the enemy attacks
[3:46:43] <JeedyJay> Nobody with THAT grin is going to have something helpful to say
[3:46:47] <+OmegaWeltall> " oh i heard you got run over by chariots... bitch! LUL "

[3:50:20] <critfumble_> Alecto tho Kreygasm
[3:50:21] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus Don't forget to talk to the renovators
[3:50:26] <+jiggy_snipe> no wait it's something
[3:50:28] <Shardlab> oh nevermind, you can't trade down
[3:50:29] <a_mad_dragon> you have five keys GO GET FISTS
[3:50:38] <+tekman527> He needs 8 keys for FIST
[3:50:42] <sonicblade38> nani? what
[3:50:42] <a_mad_dragon> aw fuck
[3:50:45] <bear_breaker20> the one who they let smoke after doing the do?
[3:50:46] <s1rcuit> @WoolieVersus fucking what!?
[3:50:47] <DatAsuna> Das hot
[3:50:47] <JeedyJay> Mind the Irony Barrier, some of them are doing it "for the meme"
[3:50:52] <%NerevaRising> Has Woolie met the employee of the month every month yet?
[3:50:52] <Darkmega97> I love it when my companion violently murders me in the middle of the street
[3:50:53] <+tekman527> Soon, hopefully
[3:50:54] <crimsonsaens> Limited offers are the only good ones
[3:50:56] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus Also, a word of advice, Aphrodite's Call is great ONLY when you use it with the full bar, the single pip is not worth it.
[3:50:59] <DatAsuna> get you a girl who will kill for you, but also kill you
[3:51:10] <+solarisknight7> Yes
[3:51:10] <bear_breaker20> @DatAsuna ew nah
[3:51:14] <%cobaltlake> Most are cosmetic
[3:51:15] <+aishman> Yes
[3:51:16] <spacecatstreams> work orders are practical, most else cosmetic
[3:51:16] <crimsonsaens> start with the work orders
[3:51:17] <blocknight1> most things are cosmetic except work orders and stuff you need for certain quests
[3:51:23] <RushUnplugged> some cosmetic, some are upgrades to the levels @WoolieVersus
[3:51:24] <%gunsrlove> Most are cosmetic yes
[3:51:24] <Saltmeisterr> yes
[3:51:25] <Shardlab> some can definitely help
[3:51:27] <nothuzad> work orders are mostly mechanics
[3:51:28] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah lots of cosmetics
[3:51:33] <nothuzad> rest is cosmetic
[3:51:34] <RevenTheLight> Where do you get the gems?
[3:51:38] <%Pigg1yJuffs> I hope that they add Hestia into this game down the line. She was the only goddess that I can think of that wasn't petty as fuck and just wanted to look out for her family.
[3:51:42] <+tekman527> Work Orders are run upgrades, the rest is cosmetic
[3:51:48] <Graxe_> Bedchambers sometimes has stuff to add
[3:51:52] <blocknight1> oh yea for sure, but there's important stuff in the renovations
[3:51:53] <Shardlab> Work orders help your run
[3:51:54] <Akett> Fated list is very helpful.
[3:51:57] <crimsonsaens> You want the work orders
[3:51:58] <TigerClaws12> Work orders influence your runs
[3:52:03] <nothuzad> work orders help runs rest is visual flair
[3:52:04] <%mitchteck> Bead chambers are good
[3:52:05] <+captain_elsewhere> ooooh fated list
[3:52:06] <blocknight1> there's healing, keepsake swapping, upgrades, fishing rod
[3:52:06] <Shardlab> The other stuff is cosmetic
[3:52:13] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus One of the things you unlock is Achievements that give you keys and darkness much faster
[3:52:18] <blocknight1> the achivement list (fated list)
[3:52:18] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[3:52:20] <blocknight1> achieve*
[3:52:26] <crimsonsaens> Fated list can return the gem investment
[3:52:31] <+kyh9> When are they going to add Grandad Chronos?
[3:52:34] <spacecatstreams> there's a lot of satisfying grind
[3:52:41] <am_omega> Chronos be dead yo
[3:52:48] <DatAsuna> *the shit
[3:52:52] <Saltmeisterr> rip fists :9
[3:52:52] <+Flambage> @WoolieVersus The cosmetic items can advance character stories too
[3:52:57] <Saltmeisterr> :(
[3:53:02] <s1rcuit> Chronos hella dead
[3:53:09] <%Pigg1yJuffs> Hestia and Hephaestus. Two gods that I want added more than anything.
[3:53:14] <+mankeyfigh> Gods, and especially Titans, don’t die
[3:53:20] <crimsonsaens> Which do you like more, this or Dead Cells?
[3:53:21] <DaBigVitus> how does this stack up to dead gods?
[3:53:22] <TigerClaws12> fist tho
[3:53:24] <critfumble_> sgg the GOAT
[3:53:29] <%Pigg1yJuffs> @s1rcuit Chronos is currently in Tartarus
[3:53:34] <spacecatstreams> chronos would be somewhere in the underworld right? torn to pieces?
[3:53:35] <s1rcuit> @mankeyfigh not true they can super die
[3:53:39] <Saltmeisterr> i think dead cells has its own stuff to it
[3:53:44] <DSD24> Hestia is the Goddess of the Hearth right?
[3:53:47] <s1rcuit> @Pigg1yJuffs because he's dead
[3:53:48] <am_omega> Tartarus is super hell if I recall correctly.
[3:53:49] <%gatorafan> People are gonna get blueballed with the fists...
[3:53:52] <+captain_elsewhere> yes DSD24
[3:53:52] <Saltmeisterr> both are still fun
[3:53:54] <TigerClaws12> ghost of steam almost fucked that boss fight LUL
[3:53:55] <+mankeyfigh> @s1rcuit I can’t think of one
[3:53:57] <Doodle_Taco> @dsd24 Yep, and family
[3:54:06] <%Pigg1yJuffs> Hearth and Family, that would be Hestia @s1rcuit
[3:54:09] <%ironohki> Are we done?
[3:54:35] <heartlesshealer> done for now
[3:54:44] <%Pigg1yJuffs> She is the best one, cause she doesn't go out of her way to fuck people over
[3:54:59] <+captain_elsewhere> i was addicted to enter the gungeon i got plat 6 months ago and i was still playing it nearly every day
[3:55:07] <crimsonsaens> Runs get so much faster after you get the work orders
[3:55:12] <rubbishbinge> whens pokemon mystery dungeon
[3:55:14] <am_omega> Also in some rouge likes its just fun to get that one run where you are stronger than god.
[3:55:34] <s1rcuit> the only two gods I can think of that don't fuck up mortal lives are Hestia and Heaphastus
[3:55:35] <+tekman527> Enter the Gungeon is probably my favorite roguelike that I've played. Hades is right next to it.
[3:55:35] <crimsonsaens> You should have a rogue-lite week with Reggie
[3:55:44] <heartlesshealer> Slay the Spire isn't isometric, it's a card game
[3:55:48] <heartlesshealer> but yeah
[3:55:59] <am_omega> When that synergy is just right for max brokenness Kreygasm
[3:56:00] <%ironohki> @tekman527 What makes Gungeon the best for you?
[3:56:09] <+mankeyfigh> I could watch people I like play rogues forever
[3:56:13] <s1rcuit> @ironohki GUN
[3:56:15] <%Pigg1yJuffs> @s1rcuit Especially love Hephaestus cause he calls the other gods out on their shit and fucks with them.
[3:56:20] <%ironohki> I mean, fair.
[3:56:30] <rubbishbinge> I never realized "ya know" is Woolie's "dattebayo"
[3:56:31] <s1rcuit> @Pigg1yJuffs lol, didn't know that
[3:56:34] <+tekman527> I generally like the gunplay and visual style that Devolver has for the game
[3:56:38] <RevenTheLight> I have the transistor key too!
[3:56:49] <s1rcuit> @Pigg1yJuffs super fitting she's the main for Danmaki
[3:56:50] <+cstigerwright> iTS ON STEAM

[3:56:54] <TigerClaws12> it's on steam now
[3:56:55] <+aishman> It's on Steam now
[3:56:55] <+maynardftw> It is indeed on Steam!
[3:56:56] <RushUnplugged> but it's NOT
[3:56:56] <zavreses> its on steam

[3:56:59] <Doodle_Taco> Its on Steam
[3:56:59] <%gatorafan> It's not

[3:57:03] <nothuzad> has been on steam for 2 months
[3:57:04] <+rei0> but it came to steam
[3:57:04] <Blue2rocky> its a fun game no matter where it is :3
[3:57:10] <%gatorafan> It WAS an exclusive
[3:57:12] <s1rcuit> @Pigg1yJuffs my bad, read it wrong
[3:57:13] <+aishman> Crazy Talk ACTIVATES
[3:57:14] <crimsonsaens> Woolie is out of touch
[3:57:18] <Jetsfantasy> Timed exclusive
[3:57:18] <heartlesshealer> Steam was bugging you because they noticed what store you were on =p
[3:57:18] <Brainworm205> It’s on Steam, goober
[3:57:19] <dellis80> lol
[3:57:19] <DatAsuna> too bad steam was down anyway
[3:57:23] <SomersaultJustice> woolmer
[3:57:23] <am_omega> Wait what game?
[3:57:24] <morow1ec> Buy it twice
[3:57:24] <+jiggy_snipe> epic only gets limited time exclusives I think
[3:57:29] <Solidnick18> neat
[3:57:37] <blocknight1> feels better having all my supergiant stuff on steam, pyre and hades joining bastion and transistor from way back when
[3:57:44] <%Pigg1yJuffs> @s1rcuit He was married to Aphrodite and she went out of her way to have an affair with Ares. Hephaestus found out and caught them in the act and put them on display for all Olympus when it happened.
[3:57:49] <DSD24> Cursed
[3:57:52] <%ironohki> Kojima Uncaged
[3:57:58] <Doodle_Taco> Hey chat, is Pyre alright? Been thinking of getting it
[3:58:02] <DatAsuna> Cage doesn't play well with other creatives, just look at hs joint interview with yu suzuki
[3:58:04] <+jiggy_snipe> what if they are great together?
[3:58:05] <s1rcuit> @Pigg1yJuffs nice
[3:58:06] <am_omega> Again no, Kojima should just make high quality TV shows.
[3:58:10] <Solidnick18> Kojimbo uncaged
[3:58:22] <heartlesshealer> yeah, Cage is negative quality
[3:58:26] <Soresier> Add Uwe Boll to the Kojima productions LUL LUL
[3:58:27] <DatAsuna> Cage is such an ass he can't even concede the influence of shenmue's QTE system on his own games
[3:58:34] <s1rcuit> @Pigg1yJuffs all Hephaestus does is work the forge, doing something productive
[3:58:42] <%ironohki> @Doodle_Taco Pyre is awesome but not for me. It's basketball. If you like a basketball video game, it's a really crazy fun fantasy one.
[3:58:43] <Sogeki_Dan> Root is great. And it's not a campaign?
[3:58:49] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus That's Gloomhaven, Root is NOT a big campaign
[3:58:51] <am_omega> @WoolieVersus What if Kojima switched to a big budget TV series?
[3:58:55] <Sogeki_Dan> It's a single play session
[3:59:11] <Doodle_Taco> @ironohki Thanks, I'll look into it more
[3:59:17] <crimsonsaens> I watched all of the Kingdom Death campaign
[3:59:17] <%Pigg1yJuffs> @s1rcuit He just gets shit done while Hestia does her best to keep people and gods from killing each other.
[3:59:37] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus Root is a single play game, it's just each game is very different depending on which faction you play.
[3:59:38] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:59:49] <s1rcuit> @Pigg1yJuffs and his work is amazing, living metal statues
[3:59:50] <DatAsuna> Moreso than the usual diminishing returns of first episodes?
[3:59:54] <Sogeki_Dan> @WoolieVersus Did you mean Gloomhaven?
[3:59:56] <dellis80> Kingdom Death art is sick
[3:59:59] <MamadHunter> Root isn't really a campaign, it's a single session thing. you might be thinking of Gloomhaven
[4:00:09] <Doodle_Taco> @s1rcuit Yo Talos is the shit
[4:00:28] <s1rcuit> @Doodle_Taco who is Talos?
[4:00:34] <drez1210> What up?
[4:00:35] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus The big campaign you were thinking of is Gloomhaven
[4:00:43] <Doodle_Taco> @s1rcuit A metal giant Hephestous made
[4:00:43] <am_omega> Though a D&D campaign from you guys would be fun, then again its just me.
[4:00:49] <RevenTheLight> Gloomhaven is fucking HUUUGE
[4:00:57] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus Root is 4 different factions, all of which play COMPLETELY differently.
[4:00:57] <%Pigg1yJuffs> Will highly recommend Binding of Isaac: Four Souls. Good for an hour or 2 long game, where backstabbing, bargaining, and bartering are encouraged. Think you would love it, @woolieversus.
[4:00:59] <BioApple> It might take a while to learn but root is like 3 hours a game once you know your faction
[4:01:04] <+aishman> Yeah, it's small and cute but it is NOT a campaign
[4:01:07] <+aishman> There's nothing that carries over game to game
[4:01:15] <heartlesshealer> depends on if you're learning on camera
[4:01:31] <arkv01> 'once you know the game' is the problem
[4:01:36] <+tekman527> I was looking at Binding of Isaac: Four Souls a while back, never got around to actually buying it though
[4:01:51] <%Pigg1yJuffs> @tekman527 HIGHLY RECOMMEND
[4:02:03] <bimblehim> have these guys played Munchkin?
[4:02:07] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus Even if you don't play it on Tablelords, seeing you get into board games makes me wish you should try it.
[4:02:08] <Sogeki_Dan> It almost sounds like he is talking about Mice and Mystics
[4:02:09] <DatAsuna> Hey by the way I'm not coming back
[4:02:20] <heartlesshealer> Mice and Mystics?
[4:02:23] <SomersaultJustice> hey by the way goodbye forever
[4:02:48] <Sogeki_Dan> Root is 1-2 hours, risk but everyone plays differently.
[4:02:56] <am_omega> I mean for pen and paper rpgs I listen to them like a podcast. I put them on while doing other thing.
[4:02:57] <BioApple> upload a 14-hour video of twilight imperium, coward
[4:02:58] <%ironohki> You doin' good, Woolie. Keep building, we'll keep watching.
[4:03:09] <DatAsuna> When's the 200 hour skyrim LP, woolie?
[4:03:18] <am_omega> When is the Warhammer 40K episode cowards?
[4:03:27] <crimsonsaens> You have 4 hour podcasts though?
[4:03:30] <JeedyJay> @WoolieVersus I've been watching a similar thing play out with people pestering Bruce Greene (formerly of Funhaus) to do more edited compilations of his streams, while he repeatedly points out that they make little-to-no-to-negative money.
[4:03:40] <heartlesshealer> thanks for name-dropping mice and mystics, got something new to bookmark now
[4:03:45] <s1rcuit> @WoolieVersus Streaming is not an exact science, just do what you think is right.
[4:03:48] <DatAsuna> the ultimate villain
[4:03:48] <This_is_Marco> so evil 😡
[4:03:53] <drez1210> Ur evil
[4:03:54] <a_mad_dragon> put lego in their shoes
[4:04:03] <DatAsuna> And yeah I'm super sick of stand convos too
[4:04:05] <+nekodelic> This is what Nen you want
[4:04:10] <bimblehim> a few weeb flowers
[4:04:18] <am_omega> What thing you want bro?
[4:04:26] <JeedyJay> The MEEEEMES Jack...!
[4:04:32] <DatAsuna> time stop is boring
[4:04:41] <s1rcuit> the problem with that convo is that you don't pick what you get
[4:04:44] <DatAsuna> I would take time/space distortion
[4:05:06] <heartlesshealer> polyglot and get punished by old testament god
[4:05:16] <dethette> if you stop time you have infinite opportunities to learn every language
[4:05:18] <am_omega> Okay Babylon.
[4:05:21] <%Pigg1yJuffs> Time stop gets interesting when you factor in science and think about how you could accidentally set off nuclear fusion reactions.
[4:05:27] <DatAsuna> Reggie wants dominate mind
[4:05:29] <+jiggy_snipe> Lawful Good
[4:05:35] <MamadHunter> Reggie's Lawful Good
[4:05:43] <Solidnick18> lol
[4:05:45] <bimblehim> very in character
[4:05:46] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> I want the power to steal AND KEEP other's powers Kappa
[4:05:49] <SomersaultJustice> Big Goods Big Lawfuls
[4:05:54] <rubbishbinge> I would like that tho
[4:06:00] <+nekodelic> Woolie wants Reggie to become a colonizer
[4:06:03] <s1rcuit> MIND SHARE
[4:06:27] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> he's insane, he knows at least 30
[4:06:27] <emeraldskrull> woolie isn't making any sense right now
[4:06:41] <%Irridium> yeah but that takes work and I am lazy
[4:06:41] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1237401882802429957
[4:06:47] <DatAsuna> What if he was polyglot, but it even included animals and aliens .etc?
[4:06:48] <bimblehim> hiding your polyglot power level ftw
[4:06:57] <Sogeki_Dan> @WoolieVersus When you gunna watch One piece since Mother's Basement given it his blessing?
[4:07:03] <This_is_Marco> SwiftRage But I want that and I don't wanna do the work
[4:07:06] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> he's just a genius for languages
[4:07:06] <+jiggy_snipe> expand it to animals
[4:07:08] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> What if the work you need to put in requires sacrificing work you need to put in elsewhere?
[4:07:14] <+Mythicalbrit> does that mean his wife was a super buff?
[4:07:19] <BioApple> you could learn time powers with training too, it's just no one's gone hard enough with it
[4:07:22] <heartlesshealer> What if polyglot included plants, animals, and whatever the heck fungi are?
[4:07:24] <DatAsuna> Also there's the extra subtext of actual absolute communication clarity
[4:07:25] <s1rcuit> @Sogeki_Dan LUL
[4:07:33] <%Klefth> Reggie just wants to be a protocol droid
[4:07:42] <DatAsuna> A power so every person understands your meaning regardless of interpretation, basically darth nihilus

[4:08:40] <am_omega> Taskmaster with infinite storage space is OP as fuck.
[4:08:56] <Soresier> I would like to alter things.
[4:09:00] <+captain_elsewhere> as if speed forcce isnt allready fuckhueg OP elaC
[4:09:02] <Soresier> So yeah,screw your knowledge.
[4:09:16] <+nekodelic> right now?
[4:09:16] <s1rcuit> infinite pizza sounds like a curse
[4:09:20] <am_omega> God the Speed Force is so stupid.
[4:09:21] <%NerevaRising> Agree
[4:09:23] <dellis80> I have found Hemomancy and Cryomancy to statistically be the most over powered and useful abilities across the board.
[4:09:35] <DatAsuna> Speaking of show recomendations y'all should check out umbrella academy
[4:09:52] <s1rcuit> @dellis80 blood manipulation?
[4:09:56] <dethette> still waiting on that ua season 2
[4:10:05] <crossing_mao> !uptime

[4:10:44] <am_omega> You wanna talk about GOLDEN SUN?
[4:10:45] <+jiggy_snipe> DewPrism :)
[4:10:48] <DatAsuna> Metroid Prime 3
[4:10:50] <mojomoud> If there's something I love about Gravity Falls is that alex hirsch (the creator) straight up ended it on his own terms and that's a rare thing these days
[4:10:51] <%NerevaRising> Bojack almost ruined Kristen Schaal for me, I just get sad whenever I heard her voice now
[4:10:51] <bimblehim> a loremaster :o
[4:10:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> @datasuna MODERN DAY?!
[4:11:08] <s1rcuit> I wanted to write a story of two heroes, one Electric, one Heat, both of which die in water
[4:11:29] <DatAsuna> @GeneralSCPatton CHUN LI?
[4:11:34] <SomersaultJustice> Featuring Spencer from the Marvel vs Capcom Series
[4:11:42] <Solidnick18> get the poster Kappa
[4:11:52] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> Spoilers so strong
[4:11:53] <+jiggy_snipe> Eva arm
[4:11:53] <JeedyJay> I did like how they emphasized the bionic arm's use in combat.
[4:11:54] <heartlesshealer> Liquid!
[4:11:57] <illTemperedSeaBass> "My wife is my ARRRRRRMMMMMM!"
[4:11:58] <%Razputin217> Where's the poster?
[4:12:02] <+eanscrale> Arm unit 001
[4:12:04] <s1rcuit> that sounds AMAZINGLY stupid
[4:12:09] <+tekman527> Remember when the Vergil DLC for DmC set up a sequel of Vergil's devil army?
[4:12:09] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> well that puts a new twist on fapping Kappa
[4:12:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> EVA ARMS
[4:12:12] <bimblehim> bionic commanfo: my wife is a yokai
[4:12:12] <am_omega> Hey technically if he jacks off with it it would be his wife Kappa
[4:12:15] <Solidnick18> Yes
[4:12:27] <DatAsuna> Well that's an LP we can't do anymore
[4:12:29] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[4:12:32] <%Ipsenscastle> Woolie upset
[4:12:46] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> Sounds like a setup for an overlong masterbation joke
[4:12:47] <Solidnick18> Damn it
[4:12:48] <+nekodelic> Can he even jack off with that arm without fucking his wife?
[4:12:50] <am_omega> LUL
[4:12:57] <+tekman527> @nekodelic yes and no
[4:12:57] <+captain_elsewhere> get the MiB flashy thing
[4:12:59] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus speaking of bad games with hilarious ending twists, inversion has a good one of those i won't spoil
[4:13:17] <JeedyJay> You would have been to Reggie in Bionic Commando '09 what Liam was to you in Starfox Adventures
[4:13:19] <dellis80> @s1rcuit My main reasoning is that the control of blood can branch into other completely different abilities.
[4:13:22] <emeraldskrull> "My transistor is my bf" is good tho
[4:13:36] <dethette> bold move for a game named inversion to have a major twist
[4:13:44] <s1rcuit> @dellis80 and also a super rough way to die
[4:13:44] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:14:00] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> Ouch
[4:14:13] <s1rcuit> @dellis80 to clarify my amazingly stupid comment was aimed at the arm/wife thing
[4:14:13] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> on some Evil Dead shit
[4:14:14] <+jiggy_snipe> and then he can talk to it Kappa
[4:14:17] <arkv01> a whole new world of wife fighter 3
[4:14:32] <am_omega> "Oh no honey don't kill her, she is just a co worker!"
[4:14:53] <T_Sasquatch> Wait that's not a joke ??
[4:15:01] <T_Sasquatch> Are you serious
[4:15:10] <bimblehim> he is dead serious
[4:15:12] <dellis80> @s1rcuit lol, I didnt see anything crazy or stupid, so you are good I guess.
[4:15:16] <JeedyJay> This sounds like Better Metal Gear
[4:15:35] <DatAsuna> That's not how you abbreviate it tho!
[4:16:08] <%Razputin217> Nathan RND Spencer
[4:16:46] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> yo thats R&D
[4:16:52] <illTemperedSeaBass> @dellis80 The problem with hemomancy is how heavily it correlates negatively with morality. You either limit yourself to your own, or play the very dangerous game of deciding who deserves their blood being used against them.
[4:17:00] <DatAsuna> fuck ben judd
[4:17:33] <JeedyJay> Just make the evil Super Joe a fake one who co-opted the Legend
[4:17:36] <%GeneralSCPatton> Ben Judd, as in Phoenix Wright? What happened?
[4:17:42] <DatAsuna> thank you for the lore
[4:17:59] <illTemperedSeaBass> @dellis80 Besides that, I fully agree with you on the power of hemomancy.
[4:18:06] <DatAsuna> @GeneralSCPatton basically ben started a scumfuck publisher who stole devil engine and fight knight
[4:18:07] <T_Sasquatch> No i imagined a rhino stripper ....
[4:18:12] <%The_Timo> HA Jokes on you I was already picturing that before you said it
[4:18:12] <Raztron> fuck keiji inafune
[4:18:14] <%rytyoung> Have the guys caught up with the sub messages?
[4:18:20] <+captain_elsewhere> zootopia elaC
[4:18:25] <%GeneralSCPatton> @datasuna Fuck
[4:18:27] <DatAsuna> @GeneralSCPatton and then went on a smear campaign to try and ruin the devs for complaining about not being paid
[4:18:29] <+BubbaRands> Rhyno with a "Y"
[4:18:30] <Solidnick18> i was thinking of both
[4:18:39] <T_Sasquatch> Rhyno was cool
[4:18:42] <%Razputin217> Rhino from Warframe
[4:18:53] <+captain_elsewhere> elaGasm Razputin217
[4:18:58] <+paladinstarbuster> NOT THOSE TABS
[4:19:00] <powerprotoman> "wait not there thats the time stop media"
[4:19:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> UNLIMITED TABS WORKS
[4:19:12] <%Pigg1yJuffs> Hell yeah
[4:19:22] <+BubbaRands> Da 'Rona
[4:19:26] <illTemperedSeaBass> The Wuu-Flu.
[4:19:31] <%rytyoung> MY CORONA-VIRUS
[4:19:34] <+nekodelic> llorona
[4:19:39] <T_Sasquatch> The rona is legit starting to get real
[4:19:41] <Solidnick18> i had a dream about getting it... it was odd
[4:20:10] <+sinistersally> What you mean "These People"
[4:20:12] <arkv01> chillax we're at like 20 in Vancouver
[4:20:16] <am_omega> Idiots not taking precaution is causing it to spread alot.
[4:20:25] <T_Sasquatch> 2020 IS FUCKING LIT
[4:20:26] <%The_Timo> Not like the Ontario guy who was diagnosed and kept riding the train for 3 days lol
[4:20:42] <%The_Timo> I think one of my coworkers may have it in Vancouver O.o
[4:20:56] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> I don't socialise in the meat space anymore, adapted to that apocalyptic virus shit before it got cool
[4:20:56] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[4:20:57] <+sinistersally> Someone escaped quarantine to go to a College party in the US
[4:20:58] <arkv01> @The_Timo like in downtown?
[4:21:11] <dellis80> @illTemperedSeaBass true, but the blood doesnt have to be from a living being or animal. Biology wise, bone is considered part of blood. Thus the ability branches into a kind of necromancy.
[4:21:13] <%Irridium> some dude in my state after finding out went to a fucking bar for some drinks
[4:21:18] <VidulaSaix> Sam Porter Bridges could've carried it Kappa
[4:21:23] <am_omega> I hear some major cities are ghost towns.
[4:21:28] <arkv01> thank YOU sir
[4:21:28] <+nekodelic> I would carry five babies in my baggage
[4:21:29] <DatAsuna> Woolie is very used to having to stuff 5 babies in a travel bag
[4:21:30] <Solidnick18> thank you for the stream @WoolieVersus
[4:21:37] <SomersaultJustice> Play KSS
[4:21:39] <DatAsuna> Enjoy your day off~
[4:21:40] <%The_Timo> @arkv01 No, Burnaby i think but works on Marine Drive
[4:21:41] <%Ecchigun> sup montreal boys
[4:21:42] <T_Sasquatch> Vader : nooooo
[4:21:49] <%Ecchigun> ah shit we done?
[4:21:54] <VidulaSaix> Transistor perhaps based on what was said earlier? 🤔
[4:21:55] <+nekodelic> What happened to steam
[4:21:57] <+nekodelic> ?
[4:22:02] <arkv01> cmon stop teasing us let us know the LP :D
[4:22:07] <Solidnick18> hmmm
[4:22:14] <dethette> thanks to both of ya for the stream <3
[4:22:17] <%Pigg1yJuffs> By the way, don't disregard that trigger warning at the beginning of Worm @woolieversus
[4:22:19] <%Ecchigun> woolie will never invite me :(
[4:22:27] <am_omega> Yo when is the GBVS RPG mode playthrough? Kappa
[4:22:28] <DatAsuna> so much kotor
[4:22:34] <am_omega> It does have couch co-op
[4:22:35] <nothuzad> coop am_omega
[4:22:55] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> I was a Dreamcast owner before it was...oh, wait it was never cool :(
[4:22:59] <%Pigg1yJuffs> Worm gets pretty rough at points.
[4:23:02] <%rytyoung> Watch Beastars too, it'll convert you full furry!
[4:23:12] <am_omega> What do you mean? Its always cool to own a Dreamcast.
[4:23:15] <illTemperedSeaBass> @dellis80 That's a fair point. We then kinda get to the topic of "is necromancy evil" though. Raising a mass grave of innocent people to fight a super-baddie is still kind of a gray area.
[4:23:16] <SomersaultJustice> my cup wooleth over
[4:23:17] <$SilverRoddo> When’s Minh and Reggie Plays?
[4:23:21] <+captain_elsewhere> a samurai anime where the characters are named after and get their powers from addictive substances elaC

[4:25:23] <illTemperedSeaBass> @dellis80 Okay. If we're not drawing distinction between a "hero" power and a "villain" power, Hemomancy is amongst the strongest to can get.

[4:26:26] <%Pigg1yJuffs> @illtemperedseabass That recommendation of a web novel I made to Woolie would be up your alley as well. Main character gains control of bugs. All bugs within her range.

[4:30:23] <heartlesshealer> I'll never get tired of this one
[4:30:31] <illTemperedSeaBass> @dellis80 I kinda get it. I kinda like subverting the tropes. A character I struck up a while ago was a hemomancer that, by the necessity of his power and the people he fights, fills kind of a moderate anti-hero role.
[4:30:55] <CrazyMedicine> The peak of Capcom

[4:33:17] <s1rcuit> idk where the trash bit comes from, but I'm glad it's a thing
[4:33:27] <dellis80> @illTemperedSeaBass I'm a hyper-realist, and ever since I was very young, I thought all comic hero/villians were stupid and everything about their characters and ideals very flawed. Batman for example. He would be more efficient at his job if he just stayed a ninja. His life would be simpler if he just killed joker and moved on and stopped bitching
[4:33:29] <dethette> from whence thy came
[4:33:30] <SomersaultJustice> hey by the way I'm leaving forever

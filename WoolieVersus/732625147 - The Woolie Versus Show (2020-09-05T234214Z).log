[0:22:22] <+xemnahort> @buttstuff_n_coffeepots don’t quote me on this but lore wise I think the guy who perfected the dual sword style was around the nobunaga era
[0:22:38] <%doomerskeletor13> Back to back duels PogChamp
[0:22:47] <alexandrecau> those ronin knows where to stand for a duel

[0:23:38] <munitalprats> why is it an archers hat?
[0:23:43] <%Rosewater_444> and he can float
[0:23:44] <alexandrecau> He stole it
[0:23:45] <munitalprats> samurai were primarily archers iirc
[0:23:53] <artificerjoni> @xemnahort Hold on, If you're thinking Miyamoto Musashi wasn't he alive during the Edo periodi?
[0:24:03] <+xemnahort> Roses are red, food is delectable, your lack of honor is easily detectable
[0:24:04] <%OldManJEWc> please tell me this his first duel with the straw hats
[0:24:15] <%doomerskeletor13> I love how he pops the sword, reminds me of Vergil in DMC5
[0:24:17] <+frog_lore> @OldManJEWc his 2nd
[0:24:28] <%doomerskeletor13> @oldmanjewc His second, he just did the first like a minute ago
[0:24:30] <%Rosewater_444> He did some offscreen no?

[1:07:06] <Tsunamidusher> Yuna: "That wasn't very ninja of you"
[1:07:09] <+xemnahort> @silvery_cricket no the escorts are invisible it’s just stealth
[1:07:36] <+silvery_cricket> "That wasn't very cash money of you lord Sakai"
[1:07:53] <%ChoculaUltra> I just got flashbacks to the Mary Jane and Miles stealth segments from Spider-man FeelsBadMan
[1:08:11] <%Irridium> I wonder if those sections will make a return in miles moralis
[1:08:31] <%ChoculaUltra> I hope they don't, but canonically Miles being sneaky would make sense
[1:08:31] <+silvery_cricket> Skyrim stealth this, murder everyone with a bow from miles away

[1:09:54] <+xemnahort> Woolie “This right arm of mine...”
[1:09:56] <%Irridium> to be fair it took me a bit to realize you just gotta move through and not kill everything

[2:21:40] <alexandrecau> Noble thief
[2:22:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yo how cool is it to find an armor and when you wear it the ghost says "you aight here's my power"
[2:23:11] <%DSD24> They probably don't know his name
[2:23:18] <%Irridium> maybe if the other guy didn't want his armor stolen he shouldn't have died
[2:23:24] <alexandrecau> Ghost said it was cool
[2:23:27] <%doomerskeletor13> It’s his armor because SHUT HP
[2:23:39] <+BottledLineArt> The spirit called out to him before he took it, so the implication is that the spirit wanted someone to take the armor.
[2:23:41] <theCoolChild> It's Gosaku's armor cause he was able to steal it
[2:24:09] <%Jack8274> I would do Yuna's
[2:24:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you need the keys before finding the door

[3:23:25] <%doomerskeletor13> I can’t imagine why Tomoe joined the mongols when she has such a stand up guy as a teacher
[3:23:30] <+jiggy_snipe> what's the difference between her and Ryuzo?
[3:23:33] <alexandrecau> She did nothing wrong except use people as target vractice for fun
[3:23:35] <%CptnCampy61> Nah she’s left bodies in streets
[3:23:44] <MichaelDood> Only Ishikawa could push someone to this
[3:23:51] <+cvp5127> shes morally grey
[3:23:56] <%doomerskeletor13> @jiggy_snipe Ishikawa doesn’t like her, that makes her cool by default

[3:24:28] <%CptnCampy61> Heads for target practice
[3:24:30] <+gnoame> Bang Tomoe and give her a kid, then teach that kid to be a better archer than Ishiwaka, should be set at 3 months old.
[3:24:39] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ishikawa "bow's don't kill people"
[3:24:56] <RamenRiderZ> the arrows do huehue

[3:26:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> WILL THEY
[3:26:45] <%doomerskeletor13> Literally the only two students that Ishikawa has had have turned into murderers, that’s NOT a coincidence LUL
[3:26:53] <+MugenSandan> I gotta ask what is SO AMAZING about Japanese archery that they gotta keep Mongolians from stealing it
[3:27:26] <$razielhex> Mongolians used short-bows; smaller and less ranged
[3:27:27] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:27:36] <$razielhex> Japanese bows were like two meters long
[3:27:47] <RamenRiderZ> It's a good thing the Mongol archers dont ride horses :)
[3:27:48] <%Jack8274> POG
[3:28:09] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @RamenRiderZ man that would make them extremely effective, i sure am glad they don't though
[3:28:13] <+gnoame> pretty sure that was an enemy archer, not ishikawa
[3:28:22] <+MugenSandan> I mean I get that but the game acts like Japanese archers can do sick DMC bow juggles
[3:29:01] <Tsunamidusher> They do in this game if you go to the wrong neighborhood LUL
[3:29:07] <%rottingpastry> The concept that Mongols needed help with archery is laughable at best, but who cares it's a good game.

[3:29:20] <+vaderxyz1970> I miss Marco Polo for that intro

[3:29:34] <%Livelinne> grannClown
[3:30:05] <alexandrecau> Ishikawa does not want his way to be taught to the enemy because that's like your enemy doing your moveset, it pisses you off

[3:31:53] <%doomerskeletor13> I love Kenji
[3:32:13] <NeroInfinite> I swear there was katanasby the time mongols invaded..since katana is just swords.
[3:33:14] <$razielhex> The progenitor to Bushido was in the 17th century, but it wasn't codified until 1899. The Japanese nobility mythologized it and retroactively applied it to themselves historically.

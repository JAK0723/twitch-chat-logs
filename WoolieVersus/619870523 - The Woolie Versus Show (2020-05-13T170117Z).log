[0:01:51] <Mr_McFries> Hey guys, Jon Williams is here. Where should I tell him to set up?
[0:01:53] <%optimasmaximas> you did not win
[0:02:01] <%optimasmaximas> i have been alone since 12:35
[0:02:06] <%optimasmaximas> i know FeelsBadMan
[0:02:15] <%ChoculaUltra> its okay.
[0:02:39] <%ChoculaUltra> I was once here alone on a day where Woolie cancelled on Twitter and I just never checked lmao.
[0:02:52] <%ChoculaUltra> ...for an hour.
[0:03:03] <%optimasmaximas> hoaaa
[0:03:07] <%optimasmaximas> hoooo
[0:03:10] <%optimasmaximas> OOF
[0:03:14] <%optimasmaximas> i feel ya
[0:03:32] <thesickestzak> Ugh can't believe Woolie is still playing this. Star Wars bad Kappa
[0:03:32] <%alpacasintophats> hmm
[0:03:36] <OverlordLuna> Ye Ye Ye
[0:03:57] <%optimasmaximas> almost happened to me and sirgoose on monday for the podcast, neither of us checked and only found out when the only other person in there checked wollz's twitter
[0:04:09] <%optimasmaximas> woulda been there for 3 hours LUL
[0:04:18] <%ChoculaUltra> ha!
[0:04:21] <%krispen_wa> SPACE CRYME TIME BEGINS NOW
[0:04:30] <ghoulishcripple> time for the space manga updates.
[0:04:34] <+yaroslev_tartakovsky> k o d o r
[0:04:48] <%krispen_wa> SourPls
[0:05:14] <%samspam999> samspam999 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Thank god for the KOTOR2 stream guys, literally only thing keeping me going through quarantine. Two month sub anniversary for the HOESMAD team!
[0:05:20] <+ThalamusDredge> Welcome back to active duty lil V
[0:05:23] <Augus7717> KOTOR 2 Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[0:05:52] <+yaroslev_tartakovsky> same tbh, really glad they've still got so much of the game left
[0:05:52] <%jinking79> He shoots the dick
[0:06:02] <%lewdskeletor13> What’s the point of playing kotor since some of the comics weren’t good Kappa
[0:06:12] <%optimasmaximas> interested to hear woolie's thoughts on the new layout
[0:06:21] <+wicketpelican> Is in here we hate star wars?
[0:06:24] <dead_harmony13> I have a feeling we're going to start with a little bit of a conversation...
[0:06:27] <%optimasmaximas> pat said he couldn't even really read chat last night cause how small it was
[0:06:29] <+yaroslev_tartakovsky> Just started Tales of the Jedi and that right there is some classic comic shite
[0:06:32] <%ChoculaUltra> oh snap, is that a stream run timer on the bottom right by the viewer count?
[0:06:40] <%lewdskeletor13> Tales of the Jedi is very off
[0:06:40] <%optimasmaximas> yeah
[0:06:42] <%lewdskeletor13> *odd
[0:06:43] <%GrassCannon> Fann missed that door in the first episode, KOTOR II is ruined forever
[0:06:57] <%krispen_wa> Why should we like Star Wars if someone made Dark Empire once
[0:06:57] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[0:06:59] <%Reverend_Roscoe> GET READY
[0:07:03] <%Reverend_Roscoe> IT'S ALMOST TIME
[0:07:04] <Mr_McFries> I want cookies but don't want to go out because virus and don't want to order JUST cookies
[0:07:08] <+yaroslev_tartakovsky> TOTJ is a weird one but I really appreciate seeing what would eventually lead to all the KOTOR stuff
[0:07:10] <%alpacasintophats> one day
[0:07:15] <%alpacasintophats> the time will come
[0:07:16] <Redblood801> !motivated
[0:07:16] <@Moobot> 1125 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[0:07:21] <+doc_ock_rokc> The time has come and so have I
[0:07:23] <%optimasmaximas> @ChoculaUltra i saw someone say there was always a timer before this update but didnt finish reading their tweet and the app refreshed when i went to look back lol
[0:07:29] <%joe_bagadou_nautz> oh man let's hope mobile data can handle this
[0:07:30] <%gunsrlove> Esaka riffs Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[0:07:31] <%optimasmaximas> SourPls
[0:07:38] <+jake5713> Hussy's perturbed!
[0:07:38] <%ChoculaUltra> oh yeah, so SWTOR is doing like a double xp thing for the forseeable future. The class stories are all p dope and you can play the entire game without grouping up with randos. Even raids.
[0:07:40] <alexandrecau> rock the dragon
[0:07:56] <%ChoculaUltra> The caveat being the game is old as dirt and some shit is locked behind a paywall.
[0:07:59] <%lewdskeletor13> I kind of like how in Tales of the Jedi they tried to make the technology less advanced to match the time period. My one complaint about Kotor is that it’s exactly the same as 4,000 years later
[0:08:09] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SourPls
[0:08:10] <+jake5713> Harlot's dismayed.
[0:08:15] <%krispen_wa> has anything cool happened in SWTOR since onslaught?
[0:08:17] <%ChoculaUltra> @optimasmaximas I swear I was on Twitch this morning and didn't even notice the changes
[0:08:30] <jorniev> rob cop is so bad ass!
[0:08:36] <%optimasmaximas> @gunsrlove is that the name of the song? i googled it and nothing came up besides an SNK wiki for what i assume is the character esaka? is this the character's theme?
[0:08:36] <+yaroslev_tartakovsky> Yeah, would have loved to see KOTOR with real Old Republic tech
[0:08:37] <%ChoculaUltra> Yes and no? The story has continued a bit but not enough for a full "YO GET IN HERE GUYS" type of thing.
[0:08:50] <%ChoculaUltra> Craziest bit? They added player pod racing, its on the PTR right now.
[0:08:52] <%ChoculaUltra> and its fucking sick.
[0:08:56] <%deviljhojho_> STAR WARS BABY
[0:09:00] <%lewdskeletor13> Is Swtor still getting new stuff?
[0:09:04] <%gunsrlove> @optimasmaximas Song is Goodbye Esaka(Arranged) from KoF 2000
[0:09:15] <%ChoculaUltra> Unfortunately there's still no in-game pazaak.
[0:09:23] <%lewdskeletor13> :(
[0:09:27] <Doodle_Taco> Hey chat KonCha
[0:09:28] <%krispen_wa> do we get to fuck lana again in the newest updates?
[0:09:32] <+yaroslev_tartakovsky> What's bizarre is that SWTOR is the only continuing form of a Legends story we have
[0:09:35] <%krispen_wa> cause i want to fuck lana
[0:09:39] <%ChoculaUltra> The Pazaak Players Alliance is still waiting in the shadows, for their day in the sun. FeelsBadMan
[0:09:44] <Redblood801> @ChoculaUltra I'd also like to say that a piece of armor introduced in 2014 had missing textures, and I can confirm that as of right now, it's never been fixed.
[0:09:46] <%DatAsuna> Just got here, what about swtor?
[0:10:06] <%ChoculaUltra> @Redblood801 dude, they still introduce the sickest armor pieces with the SAME clipping problems from launch lmao
[0:10:14] <%lewdskeletor13> @yaroslev_tartakovsky There was a one shot Legends comic that came out a year or so ago taking place after the original Star Wars comic run too
[0:10:27] <%DatAsuna> yeah capes are forever gonna be weird
[0:10:32] <+yaroslev_tartakovsky> O shit?
[0:10:38] <+yaroslev_tartakovsky> Interesting
[0:10:51] <%ChoculaUltra> @yaroslev_tartakovsky yeah, I'm actually p surprised Disney hasn't stepped in and said "no you can't do that" to the SWTOR team and their stories.
[0:10:53] <Redblood801> @ChoculaUltra YZou'd think that they'd actually get around to fixing shit.
[0:10:54] <%optimasmaximas> @ChoculaUltra prob cause it didnt update for you at that point, was talking with a guy in here yesterday during the stream who was talking about not being to catch up on VODs cause of the new layout and he wasnt able to find where they were; i had no clue what he was talking about until later on when i chilled with pat's chat before his stream and i saw the new layout myself, so apparently it's roliing out per individual viewer
[0:11:12] <%ChoculaUltra> oh that's neat
[0:11:37] <%optimasmaximas> @gunsrlove appreciate it
[0:11:39] <%DatAsuna> @ChoculaUltra Actualy they have, but mainly just on aesthetic things. E.g. the forced them to delay Ossus for later because the crashed capital ship in the sand ting resembled jakku too much before TFA came out
[0:11:49] <%lewdskeletor13> There Dr Aphra comic is fun woolieGASM
[0:12:07] <+yaroslev_tartakovsky> I have a notion that (eventually) Disney will realize that tons of fans prefer Legends content and start gearing their stuff towards that. We can only hope that they hire a good set of people and don't leave it up to the writer's room......
[0:12:10] <%ChoculaUltra> @DatAsuna ah I see. Gotta protect that new trilogy money somehow
[0:12:23] <%DatAsuna> But the creative producer mentioned they were originally gonna use that general art idea and got told no by disney just cause it /looked/ too much like a future movie thing
[0:12:23] <%optimasmaximas> SourPls
[0:12:25] <%krispen_wa> have they brought back darth jadus yet? because he's the only cool sith left
[0:12:36] <%DatAsuna> So I don't think disney cares what they do storywise
[0:12:43] <%lewdskeletor13> @yaroslev_tartakovsky I mean the current comics and novels sell really well so I doubt it.
[0:12:47] <%DatAsuna> as long as at a glance nobody confuses it for a canon thing
[0:12:50] <%optimasmaximas> i really wish woolie would link us the damn playlist FeelsBadMan
[0:13:26] <%ChoculaUltra> they only mentioned Jadus in passing on Iokath. Lana actually suspects he might be alive and the one pulling the strings behind the war iirc.
[0:13:34] <%DatAsuna> I imagine high republlic could possibly lead to them telling swtor to have less white and gold aesthetics once it's out. lol
[0:13:34] <GuilKato> finally!!!!
[0:13:59] <GuilKato> I've been missing my fault YouTube woolie kotor2 fix
[0:13:59] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1260094696292048899
[0:14:01] <+yaroslev_tartakovsky> @lewdskeletor13 But something like Jedi Fallen Order, which has also done well, has more in common with Legends stuff than a lot of Disney SW, don't know much abt the comics though
[0:14:15] <%BallerSwagBro9k> HES COMING
[0:14:16] <%ggbhtg> Tekken Tag 2 - Your Sunset
[0:14:18] <+yaroslev_tartakovsky> My god, fuck the white and gold shit
[0:14:22] <%ggbhtg> a GOOD AZZ THEME
[0:14:22] <%samspam999> I wonder if Little v managed to get past the John Williams police..
[0:14:27] <+yaroslev_tartakovsky> I really dislike most of SWTOR's art direction
[0:14:30] <%ChoculaUltra> I'm such a dweeb but, the only thing I really want in Fallen Order 2 is lightsaber dismemberment. DO IT YOU COWARDS.
[0:14:40] <%DatAsuna> JFO is feels just like a half season of rebels tonally
[0:14:51] <+yaroslev_tartakovsky> Yea
[0:15:03] <%lewdskeletor13> @yaroslev_tartakovsky Yeah but that games story and lore was overseen by the same people. Really the only bad thing is the movies, the comics, novels etc have all been pretty good
[0:15:08] <%DatAsuna> I mostly like swtor's art direction but I hate that they're homogenizing the sith recently
[0:15:12] <%optimasmaximas> @DatAsuna which sucks cause it's suppressing creative acknowledgement because it'll make it seem as though it's a high republic thing and that it did it first
[0:15:18] <GuilKato> maybe he's there via video conferencing. a tablet sitting on the couch next to woolie
[0:15:21] <%DatAsuna> A lot more standard red sabers for imp NPCs now
[0:15:40] <%DatAsuna> Used to be a lot more purple and even orange saber sith
[0:15:41] <%samspam999> video conferencing from grannys snark jail cell!
[0:16:04] <%optimasmaximas> @samspam999 for the EnPass board meeting of course
[0:16:07] <%ChoculaUltra> maybe Woolie's mom finally called in about them devil hymns
[0:16:09] <%lewdskeletor13> Wonder if Woolie would ever do Fallen Order. He might enjoy it
[0:16:26] <%optimasmaximas> @ChoculaUltra i still cant believe he got her to do the doom eternal intro LUL
[0:16:27] <%optimasmaximas> YEYEYEYE
[0:16:28] <%DatAsuna> @optimasmaximas I mean that's forever a problem with nu star wars though, everything derivative it does, someone assumes they did first
[0:16:28] <+yaroslev_tartakovsky> Fallen Order has Chris Avellone going for it. Now just get that fucker back ON

[0:25:22] <%lewdskeletor13> @datasuna “Maybe we should just kiss”
[0:25:33] <%DatAsuna> I'd kiss sheev
[0:25:37] <%ggbhtg> AKA, Pat spends a whole hour in his mind prison which would be solved by saying "The difference between this and DMC2 is the severity of the event, not when it happened"
[0:25:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> Remember that, Vader is Anakin NERFED.
[0:26:02] <%FuqBoiSlim> You think Palpatine would be a good kisser?
[0:26:18] <%lewdskeletor13> Woolie you should read the Gilles comic too, takes place after A New Hope
[0:26:20] <%FuqBoiSlim> hes probably kinda lazy tbh :Z
[0:26:21] <%xcompleasedad> @FuqBoiSlim He would be *shockingly* good
[0:26:27] <%OldManDeckardCain> vader is berfed anakin, remember that pain and suffering powers up sith
[0:26:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PLAY FALLEN ORDER WOOLIE
[0:26:40] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus The best thing about new canon, out of everything, is the Vader comics and Dr. Aphra.
[0:26:43] <%FuqBoiSlim> @xcompleasedad oh you
[0:26:45] <vulkan_vibes> *akihiko voice* I've been waiting for THIS.
[0:26:46] <%krispen_wa> They're Atton Rand
[0:26:48] <%DatAsuna> Have you seen the concept video for cut order 66 kills? There's droid head rips and air combos on ejector seats. It's real silly.
[0:26:51] <%lewdskeletor13> Woolie you should play Fallen Order at some point
[0:27:05] <+doc_ock_rokc> Some of it is good (and MOSTLY because they ripped that off of Legends) some of it is Bad
[0:27:12] <+mars_driver> @WoolieVersus I know it isn't Star Wars, but the recent Power Rangers comics are legitimately good, too.
[0:27:26] <%tearknack> wooolie, there's no "rakghoul thing"?
[0:27:33] <%tearknack> i'm not sure what you're talking about

[0:27:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> KINRATH
[0:27:39] <%ChoculaUltra> from what I'm gathering, a non-maimed, no breath suit Vader/Anakin would've basically been Uchiha Madara levels of broken?
[0:27:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> r/MetalAsFuck
[0:27:45] <%optimasmaximas> you should look into kylo ren's kyber crystal LUL
[0:27:45] <%tearknack> oh kinrath
[0:27:52] <%tearknack> woolie that wasn't a lore thing
[0:27:55] <%lewdskeletor13> Well they set up in Clone Wars that crystals react to the force user so it makes sense
[0:27:59] <vulkan_vibes> we bleed minerals. Crystals bleed minerals. Therefore, we are kyber crystals
[0:28:00] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Ow the edge
[0:28:09] <SunjammerIV> so glad they turned red lightsabers from synthetic focusing lenses into MOOD CRYSTALS
[0:28:13] <Prevot> @ChoculaUltra what kind of uchiha madara are we talking about here?
[0:28:14] <%kekkerscrew> V and Wools. Since the Light Side was never a thing in the original Trillogy what were your thoughts about how it got put into canon from the games.

[0:28:19] <+MidnightBurst12> in legends, the red crystals were synthetic
[0:28:25] <%jiggy_snipe> V's a cool guy
[0:28:25] <%tearknack> but even then it wasn't like, a lore explanation on how you get crystals, that was just a gamepaly thing

[0:28:30] <JetpackMcQuack> kinamaRee get it right
[0:28:38] <%ChoculaUltra> @Prevot I wanna say somewhere between 6 Paths Madara and Undead Madara
[0:28:48] <+doc_ock_rokc> still stupid
[0:28:48] <%tearknack> the lore explanation was, as other people are saying, that red crystals were synthetic, amde by Sith alchemy shit

[0:29:51] <%ChoculaUltra> "yeah that jedi stuff is alright, but have you taken a hit of this hatred?!"
[0:29:52] <+doc_ock_rokc> In legends most red crystals are syntetic and are stronger the natural crystals at least in some aspects
[0:29:56] <lotharrio> I like the one with the Vader fangirl, when she sees his face and he just looks annoyed/bored at everything happening.
[0:29:56] <%lewdskeletor13> That was a good panel
[0:30:02] <%FuqBoiSlim> Hatred is Based tbh
[0:30:15] <%tearknack> @WoolieVersus the lore explanation was never "you need to kill kinrath to get red crystals" because that was just a weird gameplay convenience of kotor 1, to let you get a red crystal on Dantooine
[0:30:22] <%optimasmaximas> kratos (pre-norse setting) woulda been a sick sith

[0:34:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PLAY IT
[0:34:26] <%Solidnick18> you should
[0:34:27] <+doc_ock_rokc> the Hyperspace kamikaze was cool. but its comes at such a high price of Fing up all the lore in starwars.

[0:34:31] <%masterpiecejeremy> LP FALLEN ORDER WOOLIE
[0:34:33] <%Diana869> whats this comic called?
[0:34:34] <RamenRiderZ> We need weaponized lightspeed fighter ships, JAVELIN FIGHTERS
[0:34:47] <vulkan_vibes> I need to read these comics.
[0:34:48] <%lewdskeletor13> V have you read the Vader comic that takes place after A New Hope? It’s really great too
[0:34:48] <Jaku2011> Fallen Order LP confirmed
[0:34:55] <%ChoculaUltra> y'all remember that Greatsword Lightsaber from Dark Forces 2? Now that shit was fucking rad.
[0:35:01] <%masterpiecejeremy> Make self piloted fighters designed to lightspeed through shit
[0:35:07] <+doc_ock_rokc> @RamenRiderZ Grab a few droids and junk ships point them in a direction and do some "Force is great" at a planet
[0:35:18] <%tearknack> @doc_ock_rokc yeah, thats my thoughts.. why did every capital ship on the verge of being destroyed not just do that?
[0:35:18] <jorniev> I'm imagining doom Slayer loading lightsabers into his super shotgun
[0:35:18] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:35:22] <%xcompleasedad> THE BEST LINES
[0:35:23] <%optimasmaximas> @Diana869 probably a dark horse vader comic or the marvel ones? sorry, i know it isnt much help but hopefully it helps point you in the right direction
[0:35:27] <%tearknack> they dissolve the senate in ANH
[0:35:30] <vulkan_vibes> yeahhh
[0:35:33] <%xcompleasedad> I FUCKING LOVE THIS BIT IN THE OG
[0:35:42] <%derap41> ...This is to close to reality
[0:35:42] <%xcompleasedad> IT'S THE BEST WORLD-BUILDING
[0:35:44] <vulkan_vibes> right at 0 ABY
[0:35:55] <+doc_ock_rokc> @tearknack Why build ANYTHING larger then a fighter in that instance. as it just makes a bigger target for the HK
[0:35:57] <notenoughgirls> tarkin announces that the senate was dissolved in the death star meeting where vader chokes a dude
[0:35:59] <%lewdskeletor13> Cause they thought the Death Star would give them total power
[0:36:05] <%Diana869> @optimasmaximas k thx anyway
[0:36:06] <%tearknack> the average person, by the period of the OT, barely knows about the senate
[0:36:12] <%JeromeMci> The best thing side content can do is fill in the smaller details that the main thing dosen't have time for,
[0:36:28] <%ggbhtg> For those of you like me trying to find the Lightsaber beam, look for "Lightsaber rifle" on Wookieepedia
[0:36:39] <vulkan_vibes> it's amazing in star wars how quickly long lived species forget the past.
[0:36:40] <%optimasmaximas> last 4 episodes obliterate the first 8
[0:36:42] <%lewdskeletor13> Clone Wars just had an amazing ending
[0:36:46] <%ChoculaUltra> there's also a lightsaber pistol!
[0:36:47] <%tearknack> if by "the average person" you mean randos like Luke, from Outer Rim planets
[0:36:48] <+SolidusRex> Bad Batch is good though V
[0:36:54] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> the bad batch is for ppl who watch the whole show
[0:36:54] <+doc_ock_rokc> @JeromeMci yes but the issue is when the writers of this side content want to overide main content
[0:36:57] <jorniev> the fact that they meet tarkin in clone wars annoys me
[0:37:00] <%optimasmaximas> the final shot of clone wars was poetic and beautiful
[0:37:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LIL ACK
[0:37:10] <%lewdskeletor13> @jorniev ??? Why
[0:37:21] <%ChoculaUltra> tf, is Tarkin like a child in Clone Wars?
[0:37:28] <%joe_bagadou_nautz> has anyone made a clone wars Kai?
[0:37:33] <+doc_ock_rokc> NOPE we can't because KOTOR is no longer cannon
[0:37:34] <%optimasmaximas> @ChoculaUltra nah, he's like 30 or 40
[0:37:36] <%lewdskeletor13> No Tarkin is an adult in the Clone Wars
[0:37:48] <notenoughgirls> second s7 arc mostly serves to show how ahsoka is coping with [redacted]
[0:37:50] <%lewdskeletor13> There’s only 19 years between the clone wars and A New Hope
[0:37:59] <%ggbhtg> Just like there are multiple "Clone Wars" LUL
[0:38:02] <%optimasmaximas> @ChoculaUltra anakin and him meet, which means it's the first time they met before vader and tarkin "met"
[0:38:04] <Jaku2011> If I get the wrong one is it trash?
[0:38:06] <%tearknack> @ChoculaUltra he shouldn't be? in the OT he was like 50s or 60s, and the OT is like 20 or so years later
[0:38:10] <+doc_ock_rokc> @lewdskeletor13 that still is a large chunk of change
[0:38:13] <%JustYudha> But the Vader comics don't count so it doesn't matter lmfao
[0:38:17] <%PR0swagonist> but the prequels ruined vader so whats even the point anymore wooliePOYO
[0:38:27] <%ChoculaUltra> I thought the dude was in his 50s! Looking good for a 60ish dude?
[0:38:27] <%ggbhtg> But your NOT a Star Wars poser, so....
[0:38:28] <Redblood801> Little V is a poser confirmed
[0:38:29] <+ntfth> Have they started playing the game, or have they just been talking a bit so far?
[0:38:31] <%ggbhtg> *you're
[0:38:35] <%lewdskeletor13> The 2015 Vader comic is absolutely worth reading
[0:38:37] <bleugh> comics DansGame
[0:38:38] <SunjammerIV> if you want kotor 2 sophistication in star wars writing check out the darth plagueis novel by james luceno
[0:38:43] <+Taglog7> A Canadian that didn't read Scott Pilgrim?!
[0:38:44] <%tearknack> I've read a bunch of random omnibuses over the eyars for superhero shit, and I've read basically all SW comcis ever
[0:38:48] <jorniev> are you gonna read old republic woolie?
[0:38:51] <%optimasmaximas> @tearknack he's like 30 or 40, in the arc he's in he mentions trying to secure a much larger role/position within the emperor's circle
[0:39:02] <%lewdskeletor13> @doc_ock_rokc Yeah I’m saying that it’s only 19 years so Tarkin would not be a child in the Clone Wars
[0:39:05] <donstylo> Which Comic was Vader going to a Droid planet and killt millions of Droids only with his Lightsaber?
[0:39:06] <+doc_ock_rokc> If you want something fun look at thrawn series woolie
[0:39:10] <Jaku2011> Oh god that discussion was rough
[0:39:12] <astro_yojimbo> Could you name the artist and writer, it helps to find the right run.
[0:39:15] <+doc_ock_rokc> @lewdskeletor13 ah got ya
[0:39:22] <+DesertPenguin> But you're wrong tho lol jk
[0:39:26] <%lewdskeletor13> Charles Soule is a very talented writer. And a lawyer!
[0:39:37] <%Solidnick18> yes
[0:39:42] <+Cerberus_NV> Charles Soule is great.
[0:39:46] <lotharrio> Just like how Bethesda invented first person shooters, right?
[0:39:51] <%BallerSwagBro9k> HOPEFULLY
[0:39:52] <+doc_ock_rokc> @WoolieVersus That requires them not hiring idiots that support KK
[0:39:54] <Jaku2011> Can't wait for the Disney original trilogy Remakes
[0:39:55] <ergothgaming> Did you see REYS LIGHTSABER?
[0:39:55] <+captain_history> The new Thrawn books are also pretty decent
[0:39:58] <+DesertPenguin> God damnit V how many times have you done a Frank Zappa halloween costume?
[0:40:06] <ergothgaming> It was only ever REYS LIGHTSABER
[0:40:06] <RamenRiderZ> I read a shitton of Tex Willer during my conscription
[0:40:06] <+ntfth> Have they started on Kotor before this, or has it been a discussion so far?
[0:40:07] <%tearknack> @doc_ock_rokc KK?
[0:40:09] <SuperChumps> @WoolieVersus but what about the wonder that is SWTOR?
[0:40:10] <%ggbhtg> Considering how much of a dumpster fire the prequels are, Pat wasn't wrong to feel that way. He just had terrible reasoning after the fact.
[0:40:14] <%tearknack> copyright should last 20 years AFTER PUBLICATION, fuck the Mouse
[0:40:15] <Doodle_Taco> It's unbelievable how much one good wruter makes a difference

[0:41:06] <+doc_ock_rokc> Unfortunately new writers of the High republich don't think world building is important
[0:41:08] <%ChoculaUltra> zucko instead of zuko LUL
[0:41:08] <damienlunas> When I hear "Avatar" and "Movie" I think of James Cameron
[0:41:10] <bleugh> i like korra because of muscle girl
[0:41:12] <+NormalGuy> yeah how do you fuck it up when the original medium was voiced

[0:41:34] <vulkan_vibes> I want the zucc
[0:41:36] <+HollowMan190> Same....
[0:41:37] <%JeromeMci> There was a time when that as a fan the movie would be all that others would remember and never watch the series. Bad times
[0:41:39] <TheAceol> It doesn't even need to be an MMO
[0:41:45] <+Bluemanzee> Yeah I can't get into MMOs
[0:41:47] <vulkan_vibes> OH NO. Zuko made Facebook.
[0:41:49] <%krispen_wa> AGENT BOIS
[0:41:49] <Redblood801> Jedi Knight is the worst one
[0:41:50] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Swtor turns me off, because of the combat, and as the story goes on it gets worse and worse!
[0:41:52] <SunjammerIV> the reason swtor is bad is because the writing is bad
[0:41:53] <%ChoculaUltra> Sith Warrior story was p friggin sick imo.
[0:41:54] <%spiritofmojave> only MMO I can stand is FF14 and that's not an atypical one
[0:41:59] <%DatAsuna> It's a lot of different factors for people.
[0:42:00] <AlexStAdams> yo did the stream just START or END
[0:42:02] <silver__viii> SWOTOR I feel like is more fun to think about than it is to actually play. The writing is interesting and Light Side Sith is sick af but holy shit i just don't enjoy playing the opening grind
[0:42:03] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus I'm someone who is into MMOs and I didn't like it. The problem was it was too solo-RPG for the MMO players and too MMO for the solo-RPG players.
[0:42:06] <%DatAsuna> That's a ket one for sure
[0:42:11] <gruulmagebeast> osrs is a fun mmo
[0:42:12] <jorniev> dialogue wheel annoys me
[0:42:22] <%ChoculaUltra> a lot of people say the Jedi Knight class story is KOTOR3 but pff, who wants to play a Jedi amirite?
[0:42:22] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[0:42:27] <%tearknack> @spiritofmojave i tired ff14, it was jsut as baland story wise and stale combat wise as every other MMO, at least to me
[0:42:29] <%DatAsuna> @silver__viii There's no grind anymore most people are level 50 by like the end of chapter 1 lol
[0:42:31] <notenoughgirls> i can barely look at swtor's graphics
[0:42:32] <Klefth> MMOs used to be a bit more unique and sometimes had interesting combat mechanics. And then they all had to start trying to be WoW
[0:42:54] <vorpalswordable> vorpalswordable subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:42:58] <+doc_ock_rokc> @ChoculaUltra did you hear the rumor that amy henning is wanting to do Kotor3?

[0:43:08] <OverlordLuna> WutFace
[0:43:08] <%Solidnick18> Sure
[0:43:08] <%spiritofmojave> @tearknack yeah the time-sink to get to the meaningful writing/developent means it comes REAL late, and I totally get that with the base game stuff
[0:43:17] <RamenRiderZ> FFXIV low level combat is stale
[0:43:18] <gruulmagebeast> Little V whats your favorite lightsaber setup
[0:43:19] <%ChoculaUltra> @doc_ock_rokc don't give me that. That, that HOPE.
[0:43:27] <%tearknack> @DatAsuna its less "you need to grind" and more "the combat inherently feels like a grind, every single fight"
[0:43:31] <jorniev> V you lie katamari?
[0:43:38] <%tearknack> yes
[0:43:39] <jorniev> like

[0:43:48] <+Taglog7> "limited"
[0:43:53] <+HollowMan190> has to be one
[0:43:56] <+ntfth> Yes there has been, In the Coruscant Knights seris I beleive, a Twi'lek from a Jedi adjacent Force order but not the order itself.
[0:43:57] <+doc_ock_rokc> @ChoculaUltra ah hope. the sweetest of poisions. the only thing people would willingly take knowing full well what it is...
[0:43:59] <%wunp_fxs> the only blaster shot that comes to mind is in the first drath bane novel...
[0:44:02] <+Ward_Walker> Fun fact, before GTA V, SWTOR was the most expensive video game ever made; and half of it's budget was marketing.

[0:46:44] <%DatAsuna> it's hilarious
[0:46:51] <Enemy_In_Disguise> 3 times?
[0:46:55] <%DatAsuna> "what is it skywalker?" BZZZZM
[0:47:01] <%optimasmaximas> yeah but there's a weird contradiction cause shaak ti gets called by greivous in original clone wars cartoon
[0:47:08] <+doc_ock_rokc> Jedi can't block every blaster shock numbers can overwhelm jedi
[0:47:10] <notenoughgirls> i think 4
[0:47:12] <Redblood801> IIRC, Shaak Ti is George Lucas's favorite
[0:47:13] <%ChoculaUltra> ngl, was kinda expecting Palps in Rise of Skywalker to say "initiate...Order 67!" right before the fleet of Star Destroyers rose up.
[0:47:19] <+ntfth> Any interest in playing Jedi Fallen Order once you're done with Kotor?

[0:51:00] <Silverkry2> trails of cold steel are the definition of mediocre jrpg jank.
[0:51:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> Boogie
[0:51:08] <%DatAsuna> @Commando_Joe I've made plans for that stuff
[0:51:13] <+BubbaRands> CANT STOP WONT STOP
[0:51:15] <%MisterArcanine> Shaak Ti is the original “I lived bitch”
[0:51:17] <+JamesCorck> It's good to see you Little-V. Good to see you're OK man <3
[0:51:17] <+doc_ock_rokc> @brachydios777 it should have been something like its end at the start. instead of a online casino
[0:51:19] <gruulmagebeast> FORCE MAD FORCE MAD
[0:51:20] <%ChoculaUltra> those SWTOR cinematics really do be kinda kino tho.
[0:51:20] <TheAceol> How old is that song?
[0:51:20] <%tearknack> @Silverkry2 yeha i do not get the appeal tbh
[0:51:26] <+Bluemanzee> John Williams is trying to score your life so hard
[0:51:26] <+BoBoGaijin> Next Little V remix, they see me rollin
[0:51:27] <%MisterArcanine> I still am no convinced she is dead
[0:51:28] <%masterpiecejeremy> All them motherfuckers tryna clap you and you just clap back
[0:51:35] <jorniev> oh good
[0:51:40] <%optimasmaximas> @DatAsuna oh i meanti didnt watch the og clone wars where i said grievous killed shaak ti, ive seen RotS and all it's deleted scenes already so i saw that already
[0:51:40] <%tearknack> no, the Dark was an inherent badwrong corruption of the Force
[0:51:43] <%ThePimpGuin> the pink side
[0:51:50] <@chesterr01> @woolieversus Yo V, I like your shirt
[0:51:54] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> the brown side
[0:51:56] <%kekkerscrew> There was the Force and the Darkside. The Darkside was people Corrupting the Force
[0:51:56] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @SunjammerIV
[0:51:56] <%FuqBoiSlim> the reddish-brown side
[0:52:04] <Doodle_Taco> I mean, saying that its a side is pretty obvious
[0:52:05] <%tearknack> the force is naturally "Light", and evil people corrupted the force into "the Dark side"
[0:52:06] <Daskolin> Forum was coruption
[0:52:10] <SunjammerIV> the word "SIDE" implies there's another side yo
[0:52:13] <%optimasmaximas> @chesterr01 please tell me there's merch under there LUL
[0:52:13] <%ggbhtg> It's not that I wanna talk about Kensei, it's that I've failed to mention that specific thing like 30 times over the years. LUL
[0:52:14] <%ChoculaUltra> would you guys rather be the Sith Lord or the Sith Apprentice if we're going by the rule of 2?
[0:52:17] <%DatAsuna> @optimasmaximas It's a weirdly funny death, right? xD
[0:52:25] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> We were saying light side in the 80s and none of us had anything but the movies and toys to work form.
[0:52:30] <%tearknack> that was the original intent
[0:52:30] <%DatAsuna> That's the word of lucas and filoni
[0:52:30] <%OldManDeckardCain> the african side of the force Kappa
[0:52:44] <%joe_bagadou_nautz> it just is
[0:52:45] <%kekkerscrew> The Force was naturally Neutral. The Darkside was people putting their own corruption in it.
[0:52:45] <brachydios777> @doc_ock_rokc Ya definitely, but it’s nice to see improvement rather than ignoring it, *cough* *cough* Battle field 5
[0:52:46] <+doc_ock_rokc> NOPE dark side is a natural part of the force but...the opposite of the light
[0:52:48] <damienlunas> What if you use the dark side but you're still hot
[0:52:50] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Thats what Lucas says, and I hate it
[0:53:02] <%DatAsuna> It's the lucas stance, but lucas has many bad ideas.
[0:53:03] <lotharrio> My interpretation was that the Force was just the Force. The Dark Side was just a quick and dirty way to use it.
[0:53:07] <%jiggy_snipe> there is no light or dark, there just is
[0:53:09] <AlexStAdams> The force is the Tao
[0:53:09] <notenoughgirls> where does bendu fall into all this
[0:53:10] <%joe_bagadou_nautz> is gravity inherently good or evil
[0:53:12] <%tearknack> nature isn't EVIL though
[0:53:12] <%ggbhtg> and nature is scary, damn
[0:53:12] <+doc_ock_rokc> @brachydios777 You think EA did that WILLINGLY? Disney was on their ass
[0:53:12] <%optimasmaximas> @DatAsuna yeah, walks up behind her and "that weird mix of ah/eh death scream" LUL
[0:53:13] <jorniev> it's all just space wizards
[0:53:14] <+azure22900> I feel like Jedi, just try to police the force. Calling raw power dark etc.
[0:53:15] <RamenRiderZ> Darkside is Satsui No Hado
[0:53:17] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[0:53:19] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[0:53:27] <%kekkerscrew> Midnight Gosple is good
[0:53:29] <raichu1972> iirc the Force as intended is working with it and going with the flow, and is then corrupted into the Dark Side by people trying to force (lol) it to work towards their selfish ends.
[0:53:30] <brachydios777> Dark and Light = Ying and Yang
[0:53:32] <%trustycoyote> Been meaning to watch that too
[0:53:32] <Prevot> oh god that thing sucks
[0:53:34] <%DatAsuna> noted
[0:53:35] <jase__x> ITS SO GOOD
[0:53:36] <%ChoculaUltra> Remember, if you're ugly and use the Dark Side you're a sith. If you're hot you're just a "dArK JEdI."
[0:53:39] <%ggbhtg> Recommendation pile GO UP

[0:04:28] <@Menitta> FF7 Remake is weird
[0:04:49] <fist_wizard_jay> Time to play Kingdom Hea- I mean FF7 remake
[0:04:49] <shogun_133> the combat kills it for me everything else about it is near perfect
[0:04:51] <%Double_Tap_That> @Menitta How so?
[0:04:54] <splinter1619> it is weird but once I got the fundamentals down I'm all in
[0:05:03] <+doittoit_sa> the combat is extremely good
[0:05:11] <%linSP> It’s so good sbfpSetIn
[0:05:23] <mattrutland> weird? its awesome, i love how the characters are like the Team Fourstar versions!
[0:05:31] <Wofoeh> I personally loved the Demo, it felt really good (never played any FF games besides the beginning of 7 when I was 6 and not speaking English)
[0:05:34] <judgefudge9> What up peeps
[0:05:36] <TomFrank> curious to see how long the game ends up being with the new combat
[0:05:47] <Solidnick18> barret is a weirdo
[0:05:51] <fist_wizard_jay> I like how Barret is old, black, and batshit insane
[0:05:51] <+DreyfussFrost> Eh. The one thing I want from FF7 is Classic Mode separated from difficulty. Should be two different options. Give me classic hard mode.
[0:05:52] <mattrutland> They Nailed Barretts character
[0:05:52] <Lionkevinson> I love ff7 but ffx is my favorite
[0:05:55] <trueherobappo> The combat is gonna take some getting used to for, but I guarantee the full game will have a much better explanation on how it works. @shogun_133
[0:05:55] <@Solidus_113> It's gonna be like 30 hours
[0:05:56] <judgefudge9> Wanted to play last night but was to wiped out after work
[0:05:57] <@Menitta> Definitely don't keep Combo Targetting on Fixed
[0:05:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SourPls
[0:06:03] <%CaptainPileDriver> man, i need my state tax return to hurry the fuck up and come in.
[0:06:04] <Prevot> combat system is great but the camera is fucking ass
[0:06:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> so i can actually pay some of my things off.
[0:06:14] <fist_wizard_jay> Cant wait to see more high def insane Barret
[0:06:22] <Wofoeh> @mattrutland “THE PLANET IS DYING BRRRT”
[0:06:24] <+doittoit_sa> yeah you wanna change combo targeting to free
[0:06:25] <judgefudge9> Dat bass tho
[0:06:36] <fist_wizard_jay> lol
[0:06:40] <shogun_133> @trueherobappo the button mash action combat is much to simplistic and shallow for me to enjoy it. and the classic mode is a joke
[0:06:41] <@Solidus_113> Combo targeting and camera distance should be changed
[0:06:42] <trueherobappo> "Ive had enough of this shit."
[0:06:43] <mattrutland> Jessie is so awesome now too....im gonna vbe devastated when that pillar comes down
[0:06:45] <@Solidus_113> screen shake too

[0:15:36] <Jaxnos> JESSIE Kreygasm
[0:15:37] <hntronium> Love Jessie
[0:15:40] <+Cymen90> I love how the most popular change of the Remake is changing the genre because turn-based JRPGs suck ass
[0:15:46] <Solidnick18> get ready for thristy lady
[0:15:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Jessie noe TOP WAIFU
[0:15:53] <DXLelouch24> @woolieversus game wont tell you this but switching to punisher mode when about to be hit by physical attacks parrys enemies including Scorpion
[0:15:55] <@Solidus_113> The game really wants you to abuse ATB skills
[0:16:00] <@Solidus_113> use them
[0:16:01] <fist_wizard_jay> THIS SOUNDTRACK IN SLAPPING
[0:16:03] <MayorRev> is this limit break or am i mistaken
[0:16:08] <@Solidus_113> no
[0:16:09] <mattrutland> @BallerSwagBro9k TROOF!
[0:16:09] <Man_in_the_Red> @cymen90 doodStare
[0:16:11] <MayorRev> ah ok
[0:16:12] <Solidnick18> that's later
[0:16:12] <Bailey__gaming> God fucking tier music
[0:16:13] <Dragon_Batman> A healthy amount of ATB
[0:16:13] <rubbishbinge> Limits come later
[0:16:15] <trueherobappo> Jesse the thirsty hoe
[0:16:22] <+Ryaotz> limit break is separate
[0:16:27] <%jiggy_snipe> yea Persona 5 wasn't insanely popular but whatever
[0:16:28] <MayorRev> nice pants
[0:16:30] <rubbishbinge> You can whiff super hard
[0:16:32] <@Solidus_113> It's Kingdom Hearts
[0:16:37] <%FuqBoiSlim> this game really does play like XV but better huh
[0:16:42] <rubbishbinge> FFXV had this
[0:16:47] <MillaMoks> ff15 isnt even close to a perfect blend
[0:16:47] <%Kriss1827> using the shortcuts is way better imo
[0:16:48] <@Menitta> Persona 5 was popular and thats why its lame Kappa
[0:16:49] <%fingalights> no. no it didn't
[0:16:50] <Man_in_the_Red> but XV suckes ass
[0:16:53] <+NotHereToStream> L1 for shortcut
[0:16:54] <+Woronov> ff 15 implementation sucked ass
[0:16:54] <Prevot> THIS is how a Chrono Trigger remake should play
[0:16:56] <%supersugoisenpai1> XV is bad though
[0:17:02] <+primax104> big difference is that healing is ATB gated
[0:17:06] <%linSP> Yo when’s sora
[0:17:06] <Katmon27> this is what XV tried to to but 100 times better
[0:17:07] <+Cymen90> @Man_in_the_Red If you think that is spicy, you should hear my scrub opinions on fighting games as a whole and why they need to cut all ties to their Arcade past to succeed :)
[0:17:07] <judgefudge9> 15 was such a let down
[0:17:09] <+DreyfussFrost> NO IT DOES NOT MINH. 15's combat was TERRIBLE.
[0:17:10] <MillaMoks> ff15's battle style is just "hold square"
[0:17:14] <thesickestzak> I think the best way to describe the combat is a mix of FFXV and KH
[0:17:23] <@Menitta> FFXV is fine....its fine...
[0:17:25] <jonasislike> CT remake aint happening LUL
[0:17:25] <ky_79> This is waaaaaaaay better than XV
[0:17:27] <+AltunRes> I want a parasite eve remake in this style
[0:17:32] <+primax104> atb gated healing balances the game better than 15 I think
[0:17:33] <%fingalights> its more 13 than 15
[0:17:34] <%FuqBoiSlim> @cymen90 ok zoomer
[0:17:37] <@Menitta> this is better than XV though
[0:17:56] <Prevot> what isn't better than XV
[0:18:02] <MAX116030> not really 15 was a bit more actiony even with controlling party plus constantly healing was only limited by waiting animation
[0:18:06] <%chubbypencil> What were those battle settings that they told pat to change yesterday?

[0:18:13] <nikoloas_> FUCK
[0:18:16] <+NotHereToStream> dumb apples
[0:18:17] <+KawaiiJetty> it reminds me more with KH attacking outside of combat feels quite clunky (i mean it is a buster sword but still)
[0:18:18] <+Jfrooz> GACKT
[0:18:18] <SailingSaturn> Dumbapples cirDerp
[0:18:23] <%SomersaultJustice> get gack't
[0:18:25] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus hitting the touchpad in fights does something too, check it out asap

[0:18:28] <Eger007> erase t from memory
[0:18:28] <nothuzad> like 13s systems were actually decent by 13-3 but lighting is just max trash and that story is a dumpster fire

[0:18:52] <%peanutbutteroven> peanutbutteroven subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:19:01] <Katmon27> i wonder if Genesis will be mentioned in the full game :o
[0:19:03] <+NotHereToStream> oh right, wonder how woolie will feel when he discovers parry
[0:19:03] <goose_attack_almanac> @WoolieVersus Guard sometimes has a counter while in Punisher Mode
[0:19:03] <rubbishbinge> punish moar
[0:19:04] <+primax104> did they see the ZAG graffiti?
[0:19:05] <mistermastergreg> @WoolieVersus GACKT will be a secret boss
[0:19:06] <nothuzad> guns dont mean shit if they cant hurt you :)
[0:19:08] <Solidnick18> stinger
[0:19:10] <powerprotoman> so you excited to not actually play this because its got streaming guidelines ala persona 5?
[0:19:11] <@Solidus_113> I think there's delay combos
[0:19:11] <+primax104> Zack Angeal Genesis
[0:19:12] <Solidnick18> whatever
[0:19:21] <%gatorafan> calm down Squall
[0:19:22] <+NotHereToStream> you can hold square for AOE attack
[0:19:40] <Man_in_the_Red> i hope the entirety of Dirge of Cerberus will be playable soon Kappa
[0:19:41] <+NotHereToStream> and a berserker buff in operator mode if you hold square
[0:19:55] <+KawaiiJetty> the music in this though SeemsGood
[0:19:56] <@Solidus_113> This game is balanced for PhysX
[0:20:04] <Katmon27> waiting for Crisis Core remake after these games are released
[0:20:25] <%gatorafan> Welcome to the future Woolie Kappa
[0:20:29] <Solidnick18> i think you change maps
[0:20:31] <%jiggy_snipe> come on Woolie always hug walls and corners
[0:20:32] <Man_in_the_Red> when is that Turks phone game getting a remake
[0:20:35] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> oh my god i am so moist for this game
[0:20:38] <spirittiart> eew..
[0:20:42] <nikoloas_> 15 combat is bad
[0:20:43] <rubbishbinge> oh heavens no
[0:20:46] <Dragon_Batman> Crisis Core may never get remade cuz of Gackts involvement
[0:20:46] <%fingalights> how
[0:20:47] <+primax104> 15's Gladio is a base for cloud it seems
[0:20:52] <rittzler> 15 isnt as close as you might think tbh
[0:20:55] <mistermastergreg> this is more KH tan XV
[0:20:56] <Afroperonista> "extremely very similar"
[0:20:57] <$QueequegTheater> I hate it
[0:20:58] <+OmegaWeltall> 15 tried ...
[0:21:02] <+DreyfussFrost> It's really not, Minh.
[0:21:02] <Prevot> the slowdown looks so fucking cool
[0:21:03] <mistermastergreg> *than
[0:21:03] <Quietshun13> this is much better than 15 combat
[0:21:03] <$QueequegTheater> ATB SUCKS
[0:21:04] <+Nobrev> @katmon27 too bad gackt killed any chance of a crisis core rerelease of any kind with copyright stuff
[0:21:09] <+JacknZack27> This is what 15 should be
[0:21:10] <%optimasmaximas> nah
[0:21:13] <%gatorafan> Woolie never finished KH FeelsBadMan
[0:21:14] <%FenixSeraph> I think it's a proper time freeze, they're just finishing their animations so it looks like time is passing
[0:21:14] <judgefudge9> The wait mode in 15 sucks
[0:21:15] <%SomersaultJustice> kill those evil shinra boxes!
[0:21:17] <raveous> combat in this game is closer to kingdom hearts than anything else
[0:21:18] <mattrutland> Lets pretend 15 didnt happen, it was just a tech demo for this....
[0:21:19] <Man_in_the_Red> Square should just remake every FF7 compilation game so they could make double the money, but make the series twice as hated
[0:21:21] <+DreyfussFrost> They may be the same genre but they're not similar.
[0:21:22] <%netrac> is a mix between XV done right and KH2
[0:21:26] <@Solidus_113> look up often too
[0:21:31] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> i feel like this is probably the peak of FF combat imo
[0:21:31] <zayasu> 15 combat is awful, i even prefer 13
[0:21:40] <%SomersaultJustice> soulja boy making a comeback

[0:23:58] <%gatorafan> Why you hating cloud? daedra1CryingTibs
[0:23:59] <rubbishbinge> Can't wait for the elevator bit
[0:24:00] <%FenixSeraph> Tyler Hoechlin is a pretty well established actor
[0:24:01] <@Solidus_113> many anime grunts
[0:24:03] <nikoloas_> Best dad
[0:24:04] <%FenixSeraph> and he's Sephykins

[0:24:13] <hntronium> He is paying
[0:24:16] <patt_e_cakes> I hate how stereotypical they make barret sound
[0:24:16] <+VashyronM> Did Woolie just start?
[0:24:16] <jacknerik> There it is
[0:24:17] <%Irridium> money shot
[0:24:17] <@Solidus_113> MONEY SHOT
[0:24:18] <%SomersaultJustice> clap now
[0:24:19] <Solidnick18> here we go
[0:24:20] <jmpeil> Badger and skinny pete had a discussion about RE4 in a breaking bad ep

[0:24:23] <+Cardz_> 10,000 gil worth of HAIR TONIC
[0:24:25] <MAX116030> thats the shot
[0:24:26] <Quietshun13> I clapped
[0:24:27] <rheviel> yeahhhh
[0:24:27] <rubbishbinge> eyyyyy
[0:24:29] <jonasislike> Kingsglaive can fuck off and die in obscurity
[0:24:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SourPls
[0:24:32] <@Solidus_113> fight dogger
[0:24:34] <+griffball13> BREAK HIS BONES QUICKLY
[0:24:34] <ImasukyLomae> Get the Gil Get the Gel
[0:24:38] <judgefudge9> Dat shot
[0:24:39] <thesickestzak> ITS THE THING
[0:24:40] <raveous> would be kinda cool if the demo started right there from the start
[0:24:41] <+Nero__Zone> one of those posters was a hair product
[0:24:41] <TReaperx1> its That shiva Gel
[0:24:43] <Prevot> SNUFF THAT PUPPER
[0:24:44] <%supersugoisenpai1> Dark Souls lock on
[0:24:45] <%SomersaultJustice> time to jojo this dog
[0:24:48] <+rednecked__crake> hi puppey jinnytHype
[0:24:50] <%gatorafan> it takes 400,000 G to keep this hair up for 12 seconds
[0:24:52] <Quietshun13> beefy dog
[0:24:55] <TomFrank> why that dog got so much health?
[0:24:58] <@Solidus_113> Look at Woolie mash that square button, we can see it on the menu
[0:25:00] <+DreyfussFrost> @woolieversus Try switching combo targeting in the options, see which version feels better.
[0:25:00] <rubbishbinge> Back to the lifesteam
[0:25:04] <Iggeh0> this game is perfect for Woolie, he gets to kill dogs
[0:25:08] <nigawatts1988> The dogs are designed to teach you to stagger.
[0:25:11] <@Menitta> I would recommend switching combo targeting to free
[0:25:19] <+NotHereToStream> L1 for shortcut if you don't want to go into command menu
[0:25:20] <Xelhesia> ^
[0:25:21] <thesickestzak> 13 is doodie
[0:25:24] <coreybom> @woolieversus You can switch it to r1 if you like.
[0:25:24] <nigawatts1988> The parry also works really well on them.
[0:25:26] <%RioGascar> im noticing no pupper doing a sad sound when he died
[0:25:29] <MayorRev> that guard mustve been pretty attached to that doggo BibleThump
[0:25:37] <%linSP> 13 combat is its best feature
[0:25:37] <%RioGascar> probably cause you would feel bad
[0:25:47] <jonasislike> Use clouds stinger woolie
[0:25:49] <judgefudge9> This is when Cloud is trying to be a cool guy
[0:25:54] <@Solidus_113> You can also zoom out the camera in the options
[0:25:59] <rubbishbinge> I missed a Braver and felt like shit
[0:26:00] <ImasukyLomae> Stinger the do
[0:26:22] <thesickestzak> woolieGASM
[0:26:28] <Man_in_the_Red> stop trying to red parry bullets
[0:26:33] <nigawatts1988> it's worse when you miss a stinger and go way past the enemy you were aiming at.
[0:26:37] <MattoBii> they do melee, but it's not super common
[0:26:42] <Mangahero18> The combat is already way more complex than I expected
[0:26:53] <@Solidus_113> you have a bunch of potions to use
[0:26:59] <@Menitta> Switch combo targeting to free. That way you can move between targets mid combo and combat just flows much better
[0:27:01] <nigawatts1988> I just can't stop thinking how much better FFXV would have been with this combat system.
[0:27:02] <+slayabee> You can parry physical attacks with punisher mode
[0:27:08] <+Nobrev> you also get a free counter if, while in operator mode, you press triangle as you get hit by a melee
[0:27:12] <thesickestzak> Does anyone know what the moogle medals do?
[0:27:20] <+NotHereToStream> holding square in op mode gives you buff
[0:27:31] <+KawaiiJetty> eeh i think it is nice having some new mechanics
[0:27:31] <Man_in_the_Red> @nigawatts1988 but that would require a vision, and a director that didnt derail the project at every turn
[0:27:32] <zafooru> !uptime
[0:27:32] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 27 minutes and 34 seconds
[0:27:38] <Solidnick18> Dog
[0:27:38] <nigawatts1988> Beserker Buff + Braver hits like a truck.
[0:27:54] <rheviel> holding square is a string
[0:27:58] <+Nobrev> @notheretostream I thought the buff was holding square in punisher
[0:28:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yooooooo
[0:28:02] <StarlitStunner> sbfpYeyeye sbfpPat sbfpYeyeye
[0:28:09] <MayorRev> BIG stagger
[0:28:13] <+Zanco23> Why didn't he just keep moving and crouch through the cage?
[0:28:17] <+NotHereToStream> @Nobrev holding square in punisher is a aoe attack
[0:28:19] <judgefudge9> Punisher mode is godlike
[0:28:21] <ImasukyLomae> Combo on the pupper
[0:28:27] <%SomersaultJustice> their stun
[0:28:41] <mattrutland> How many times y'all already played this demo? notice more each time...love it already so much!
[0:28:41] <%RioGascar> man adding slow down + ABILITY TO CANCEL thing
[0:28:46] <+thackattack00> Nah holding square in Operator is aoe and punisher is buff
[0:28:47] <DeebzNutz100> First run?

[0:28:56] <%RioGascar> jesus that would be nightmare inducing for testing
[0:29:05] <zafooru> I like these menus, they've got that gradient of old but still look clean
[0:29:07] <+NotHereToStream> i think im getting my modes confused
[0:29:10] <+Nobrev> @notheretostream that's operator. operator is the fast one. punisher is the slow one.
[0:29:20] <+NotHereToStream> @Nobrev ah, my bad
[0:29:20] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule

[0:30:01] <nigawatts1988> Even more interesting....Stinger is unique to the Buster Sword and other weapons have different abilities. Wonder what else is in store for us. I hope Nailed Bat has a swing like Auron's overdrive.
[0:30:03] <%linSP> materia tutorial not in demo woolieMIRIN
[0:30:06] <+Nobrev> has woolie read any of the tooltips or is he only going off what Minh is saying
[0:30:13] <%Irridium> the square square square and the square square square
[0:30:15] <Prevot> if it was full action this would be to shallow, but since its both it works fine
[0:30:18] <HolisticField> is this a video game?
[0:30:19] <+prime_name> That feeling is the best
[0:30:19] <Ultimatefool> So is this game still fake
[0:30:22] <bunnyscruff> I'm hoping Nomura's next game is Verum Rex
[0:30:23] <+SkaiVibration> Can't wait for this game maaaaaan
[0:30:40] <DeebzNutz100> not mad but it would have been cool to have a combo tree.

[0:33:22] <nigawatts1988> if she got shot in the center of the chest that armor would bend directly into her sternum.
[0:33:27] <rosemon5001> can you adjust the camera distance or nah? @WoolieVersus
[0:33:30] <%SomersaultJustice> talking to us
[0:33:35] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @randominternetsurfer
[0:33:36] <+nekodelic> only destroy corporate commodities
[0:33:39] <DXLelouch24> You can juggle if you time your hits but enemies too squishy
[0:33:40] <$razielhex> and those titplates richochet into her stomach
[0:33:42] <judgefudge9> Amazon=shinra
[0:33:54] <HolisticField> oh look its the dumb ass bobbie armor
[0:33:56] <+Nobrev> @rosemon5001 camera distance is an option
[0:34:05] <%linSP> Eat the shinra elite
[0:34:09] <Bailey__gaming> i played this demo like 30 times yesterday i think i need help lol
[0:34:12] <rosemon5001> ohh good @Nobrev
[0:34:17] <MayorRev> they have weak points?
[0:34:18] <zayasu> try setting camera distance to 3
[0:34:19] <$razielhex> "Attack the weak point for massive damage" -- Minh T. Fresh
[0:34:21] <randominternetsurfer> Someone tell him to hold the square button for different things to happen.
[0:34:29] <rubbishbinge> He knows
[0:34:33] <nigawatts1988> I don't mind her personality, but I think it would make more sense if they gave her a flak jacket
[0:34:36] <%FuqBoiSlim> some enemies are weak to fire. is that what minh means?
[0:34:36] <+griffball13> jessie wants that DICK
[0:34:38] <DeebzNutz100> Probably going to be 5 atb max
[0:34:38] <NiktenKing> You can use touch pad to check info on enemies IIRC
[0:34:38] <MayorRev> how do you figure out the weak points
[0:34:39] <%Double_Tap_That> Sassy idle pose he's got

[0:35:08] <+KawaiiJetty> good job girl
[0:35:08] <%FenixSeraph> boob cup armor is literally dangerous to the wearer as it increases the chance of the armor punching a hole in their heart
[0:35:09] <%fingalights> there is a way to view beastiary during battle. think its pushing down when highlighting enemy

[0:38:08] <%Irridium> "when equipped with a ranged weapon" wait does he get melee weapons?!
[0:38:11] <ImmaCanuck> A V A L A N C H E That's who we be!
[0:38:12] <arikk42> Barret*!
[0:38:14] <$razielhex> I think at that time of the game, Barret's best weapon is literally a cannonball he bashes people with.
[0:38:17] <@Menitta> this part sucks with the camera
[0:38:19] <rubbishbinge> overchaaaarge
[0:38:19] <@Solidus_113> You might want to increase camera distance in options from here
[0:38:20] <nigawatts1988> They made all of Avalanche incredibly likable, so when the thing happens...it'll hurt.
[0:38:24] <%gatorafan> Local man is super crazy, but very loud so... Who knows?
[0:38:28] <+wjones0415> @irridium yeah, several in fact.
[0:38:35] <Solidnick18> you charge it
[0:38:38] <rubbishbinge> Heal cloud when you can
[0:38:42] <%jiggy_snipe> a big fist
[0:38:48] <+nekodelic> @irridium yep
[0:38:52] <%Irridium> well then
[0:39:00] <+NotHereToStream> you can access the bestiary with touchpad during battle i think
[0:39:13] <nigawatts1988> Lets say you can actually semi-romance Jessie...then you attempt to romance Aerith....in the last installment will Cloud think he's cursed?
[0:39:19] <OkamiDude15> oh cool i didnt know that
[0:39:24] <+wjones0415> @irridium he had like 4 or 5 in the original game too.
[0:39:27] <$razielhex> Cloud is cursed @nigawatts1988
[0:39:27] <@Solidus_113> The game really wants you to abuse ATB skills, you get pips so fast
[0:39:27] <ScreamLord> Aww, I missed Woolie reacting to Barret screaming about the planet
[0:39:27] <%fingalights> NICE, I didn't know this untill Max stream

[0:40:05] <nigawatts1988> I thought AP let you equip more materia?
[0:40:11] <nigawatts1988> It's been awhile tho.
[0:40:13] <DXLelouch24> Its called Assess
[0:40:18] <PunishedMercer_> smt? what's that? Kappa
[0:40:30] <+nekodelic> @nigawatts1988 AP is like materia exp
[0:40:31] <OkamiDude15> ap levels up your materia
[0:40:33] <@Solidus_113> Dpad switch target is only when you're solo
[0:40:33] <Man_in_the_Red> @punishedmercer_ a relic from a better time
[0:40:35] <bunnyscruff> The only thing I don't like about this game is that potions cost atb

[0:41:19] <arikk42> WTF LUL LUL
[0:41:20] <+p4ntless> NEW! DAY ROCKS!
[0:41:20] <OkamiDude15> equiptment have slots that determine how many materia you can stuff in them and whether or not they're linked or seperate
[0:41:21] <Iggeh0> They made Barrett 10 times better
[0:41:21] <%Irridium> HE SANG THE LINE
[0:41:22] <%FenixSeraph> Prompto and Barrett are Gunboy Bros
[0:41:22] <Xelhesia> lmao i didn't hear that before
[0:41:22] <%FuqBoiSlim> LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[0:41:25] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> The tutorial is accurate when you're Solo. If you're solo the Dpad defaults to switch target but if you're in a party it defaults to switch character @WoolieVersus
[0:41:25] <%fingalights> Everyone is a sassy dork
[0:41:26] <arikk42> first time hearing this
[0:41:27] <AthenaAegis> Wise fwom your twash gwave Woolie! Kappa
[0:41:29] <HollowMan190> I never got that holyshit
[0:41:29] <rubbishbinge> I hope everyone does that
[0:41:32] <Man_in_the_Red> I clapped when i heard it
[0:41:34] <+kyh9> This game nails literally every character's essence
[0:41:37] <@Menitta> "DO THE LINE BARRETT"
[0:41:38] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Kefka did it first dang it!
[0:41:39] <Dragon_Batman> @arikk42 It might be on your end, the stream is running fine for me
[0:41:42] <rheviel> I didn't hear that in my playing that's amazing
[0:41:47] <rubbishbinge> L1 for quick
[0:41:47] <+wjones0415> lol, barret is best boi!
[0:41:51] <$razielhex> gonna be great in the lask disk where Cloud is in the Lifestream and Tifa is the party leader for a good portion.
[0:41:56] <yeildingthought> Backseat minh Kappa
[0:41:59] <fen6> shortcuts are awesome Kreygasm
[0:41:59] <+Ahegaliant> That spatial awareness
[0:42:01] <%fingalights> I played twice and didn't hear that
[0:42:02] <nigawatts1988> My hope, is that other characters have reactions to Barret doing that. Tifa will laugh and be like "Really?" while Aerith joins with him in singing.
[0:42:05] <i_heart_gaming> has he unlocked the GUN man?
[0:42:07] <arikk42> Dash
[0:42:16] <OkamiDude15> he has unlocked gun man
[0:42:19] <@Solidus_113> look at all this money
[0:42:27] <Chatterbox1991> HIT IT WOOLIE
[0:42:28] <%jiggy_snipe> keep getting hit by the lasers they won't kill you
[0:42:29] <Chatterbox1991> DO IT
[0:42:32] <%Irridium> hit it several times

[0:42:32] <Saltmeisterr> L A Z E R
[0:42:33] <@Solidus_113> GET HIT
[0:42:34] <DXLelouch24> Just run into them theres dialoge
[0:42:34] <arikk42> @Dragon_Batman thanks
[0:42:36] <+griffball13> jesse has alot of lines if you get hit
[0:42:36] <%Grayhammatter> hit them woolie, multiple times
[0:42:38] <%SomersaultJustice> yeyeye laser torture
[0:42:40] <rubbishbinge> this might be the worst security system ever
[0:42:40] <Xelhesia> @WoolieVersus check how many lines they recorded for the lasers
[0:42:41] <+jessedouglas> Lasor
[0:42:43] <+kyh9> She's so thirsty
[0:42:45] <%linSP> yessss laser lines
[0:42:46] <+PanicSwytch> Hit the lasers
[0:42:48] <Dragon_Batman> @arikk42 No prob
[0:42:49] <OkamiDude15> now we wait for the pc version to mod in the old blocky ps1 models psaDab
[0:42:51] <MattoBii> nothing like a little danger to get the juices flowing
[0:42:51] <Chatterbox1991> hit the lazers
[0:42:52] <%FuqBoiSlim> Woolie, you have to walk into them
[0:42:55] <+NotHereToStream> eat laser for dialogue
[0:42:55] <+doittoit_sa> hit the lasers many times
[0:42:59] <Ianrazz> Hit the Lasers for funny
[0:43:00] <nobodycloud> The music in this is so good
[0:43:02] <phileq> Why would anyone ever install retarded lasers like that?
[0:43:04] <bunnyscruff> Co
[0:43:07] <%fingalights> Its amazing how the had Jessie shoot up the Waifu scale
[0:43:13] <nigawatts1988> Woolie better activate her thirstiest line later....I was unsure what was wetter, Jessie or the Mako Reactor Room.
[0:43:13] <+PanicSwytch> Hit the lasers line many times
[0:43:13] <0rond> good thing whoever set these lasers up made sure they occasionally turn off for easy bypassing
[0:43:14] <fuzz9369> why no pat?
[0:43:23] <zayasu> @WoolieVersus walk against the lasers for dialogue
[0:43:23] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1234692167358177282?s=19
[0:43:28] <nigawatts1988> Pat played last night
[0:43:29] <Saltmeisterr> pat already did the demo
[0:43:30] <Solidnick18> pat played it last night @fuzz9369
[0:43:30] <arikk42> omg the fans of PC version would add so much Porn into the game
[0:43:32] <nigawatts1988> twice
[0:43:32] <%SomersaultJustice> oh no, woolie is too good at it
[0:43:32] <Man_in_the_Red> 2025 Kappa
[0:43:33] <+kyh9> Thank goodness Jessie and Biggs and everyone survives the whole game, and Jessie and Cloud can bone in the end
[0:43:38] <%fingalights> I hope its in three
[0:43:41] <Dragon_Batman> I would be amazed if they put a fixed camera segment somewhere in the game as a call back
[0:43:41] <MAX116030> Apparently this was not in E3 demo because there was no running in the begining
[0:43:42] <%fingalights> Parts
[0:43:43] <hntronium> sounds worth it tho
[0:43:48] <thesickestzak> I would pay good money for original model dlc in this game like RE2 Remake woolieGASM
[0:43:50] <$razielhex> Barret got friend by all three
[0:43:52] <Solidnick18> hit da lasers
[0:43:53] <OkamiDude15> @arikk42 foolish of you to think they havent already been doing that
[0:43:55] <Man_in_the_Red> @thesickestzak ^
[0:43:56] <@Solidus_113> Today is also the original release date for the remake
[0:43:57] <Wild_Samurai> Go into the options and pull the camera back. It BARELY moves back also
[0:44:01] <+nekodelic> Woolie, get hit by the lasers until you exhaust the dialogue
[0:44:02] <nigawatts1988> they had to restart cuz the original version sucked so bad Square scrapped it.
[0:44:03] <%RioGascar> and during that time no ff16
[0:44:03] <fuzz9369> thanks guys, I really want an lp with pat
[0:44:08] <RayCSmooth> keep getting hit
[0:44:09] <Dragon_Batman> Nice Minh
[0:44:11] <%jiggy_snipe> get hit multiple times
[0:44:12] <Xelhesia> multiple times
[0:44:13] <%RioGascar> I would rather this not exist and get ff16
[0:44:17] <Zbyrd0961> DO IT
[0:44:21] <+solzan2000> its the little things that matter, am glad it was delayed
[0:44:21] <Chatterbox1991> based minh
[0:44:22] <nigawatts1988> FF16 just has to use this games battle system and I'll buy it.
[0:44:24] <arikk42> @OkamiDude15 no no, that's the reason why i thought about it in the first place
[0:44:33] <Zbyrd0961> THIS IS NECESSARY
[0:44:38] <phileq> Okay seriously...why the fuck is Shinra, with presumably the best engineers and contractors, installing these dumbas fuck lasers that can so easily be bypassed?
[0:44:39] <nigawatts1988> Don't care how dumb Nomura makes the story.
[0:44:46] <Dragon_Batman> Wait for it
[0:44:50] <s1rcuit> so far the dialogue in this is great
[0:44:50] <%RioGascar> Now if we have ff16 being developed in tandem with this then its fine i suppose
[0:44:51] <+solzan2000> baddd
[0:44:53] <+solzan2000> lol
[0:44:56] <%DatAsuna> yes
[0:44:56] <@Solidus_113> woolieGASM
[0:44:57] <Crashfan01> SHE KNOWS???
[0:44:58] <Man_in_the_Red> @phileq because
[0:44:58] <Xelhesia> theres like 20+ lines recorded
[0:44:58] <Solidnick18> almost
[0:45:01] <nigawatts1988> It's cuz FF7 already had a good script.

[0:45:24] <%gatorafan> it's like the game expects you to drop spaghetti when the girl is watching daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:45:25] <+solzan2000> should do 100dmg
[0:45:30] <hntronium> Is Cloud just Reggie?

[0:45:33] <fist_wizard_jay> REGGIE
[0:45:34] <@Solidus_113> potions
[0:45:35] <thesickestzak> Reggie has a laser fetish doesn’t he?
[0:45:38] <Dragon_Batman> Yea that was real damage even if it was small
[0:45:39] <@Solidus_113> you have a dozen
[0:45:40] <Iggeh0> like a walk in the park where you're being shot at
[0:45:41] <%SomersaultJustice> there's a line about this being a fetish
[0:45:48] <Aydarkzero> L1 + X is ALWAYS CURE
[0:45:49] <%fingalights> does it?
[0:45:53] <Dragon_Batman> Does it?
[0:45:54] <rubbishbinge> Like a walk in the S&M park
[0:45:57] <%supersugoisenpai1> It does not
[0:45:58] <rubbishbinge> Very slow
[0:46:01] <OkamiDude15> @Aydarkzero as it should be
[0:46:06] <+Fortunato5678> I think it only fills from the Shinra boxes
[0:46:07] <%jiggy_snipe> must be really slow then
[0:46:09] <%fingalights> You get some from boxes i know
[0:46:14] <phileq> @fingalights I guess my point is that, if they really wanted to keep people out, just install a giant wall or door or some shit.
[0:46:15] <Dragon_Batman> I'm gonna test it
[0:46:17] <%FuqBoiSlim> I think it does cuz I've only had to use an ether once in this demo
[0:46:19] <%jiggy_snipe> i know mako shards give mp
[0:46:19] <arikk42> Cloud: Metal Gear !!!
[0:46:24] <$razielhex> Cloud was given John McClane lines
[0:46:31] <mistermastergreg> Well it is a demo, feel free to use potions
[0:46:35] <%supersugoisenpai1> Potions heal more, and they give you plenty
[0:46:37] <%linSP> breaking stuff gives boosts of my, use then ethers boy
[0:46:39] <%fingalights> @phileq oh yea, totally. But video games
[0:46:41] <nigawatts1988> I could swear it regens slowly during combat, cuz during the boss I was out of mana on Barret and didn't use a Ether and he suddenly had enough to cast Lightning at the end.
[0:46:46] <Solidnick18> magic woolie

[0:47:44] <%SomersaultJustice> stomp
[0:47:47] <%Lapinelis> Yo, when did this start?
[0:47:48] <nigawatts1988> They gave the enemies in this game monster hunter weak points. Also some attacks only happen depending on where you are standing in relation to the enemy.

[0:49:36] <ralphfromdk> It's a good thing for Cloud that he is handsome, because man that boy is dumb and unlikeable.
[0:49:37] <%SomersaultJustice> 21, suck my dick

[0:49:51] <Zebroneath> Tifa is 22
[0:49:54] <Katmon27> i think

[0:50:57] <MattDemers> Jessie is so cute
[0:50:58] <%ozzrabbit> Remind me, cloys was 16 when he enlisted, right? And that was 5years ago?
[0:50:59] <Solidnick18> Football

[0:51:03] <hntronium> Love jessie
[0:51:15] <arikk42> Barret is saying what everyone while playing
[0:51:16] <%linSP> I could go for some mako
[0:51:17] <hntronium> Talk to jessie before going down
[0:51:20] <%fingalights> Same!
[0:51:21] <%ozzrabbit> I mean Cloud*
[0:51:24] <Dragon_Batman> I was the same
[0:51:24] <Katmon27> aerith is a hag Kappa
[0:51:25] <nothuzad> dummy :)
[0:51:28] <zafooru> It reduces your Pheonix guage!
[0:51:33] <Graxe_> They also use that wording in FF12 because that's how FF12 is with its prose.
[0:51:47] <Aydarkzero> love the KH menu style Kreygasm
[0:51:48] <Graxe_> "A phial of Bacchus's Wine" and other stuff
[0:51:52] <@Solidus_113> Nothing carries over
[0:51:52] <MattoBii> save doesn't carry over
[0:51:56] <+primax104> Like mini medals from DQ!
[0:52:01] <rubbishbinge> exchange 4 fusion swords plz
[0:52:02] <%Irridium> when jessie calls you a dummy Kreygasm
[0:52:02] <Prevot> is it like mini medals in DQ?
[0:52:11] <rosemon5001> on what platforms are they planing to release this on? playstation,xbox and maybe pc?
[0:52:12] <TomFrank> collectible padding

[0:52:24] <+tweedler92> Phoenix down stuff
[0:52:29] <yeildingthought> Demo doesn’t carry over save
[0:52:29] <+primax104> @rosemon5001 probably ps exclusive for 1 year
[0:52:30] <nigawatts1988> I hope Moogle Medals are to enhance weapons. Since Cloud gains different abililties from different weapons, it would be useful to enhance the Buster Sword to keep up with later weapons if you want to keep using Stinger.
[0:52:35] <+thackattack00> Playstation gets a year of exclusivity and then it goes to xbox
[0:52:37] <Graxe_> Down feathers
[0:52:38] <Mangahero18> Its about time Final Fantasy imitated its vastly superior rival RPG series; Dragon Quest.
[0:52:38] <+thackattack00> Idk about PC
[0:52:42] <kingkeldeo31> feathers
[0:52:44] <+primax104> it is down feathers
[0:52:45] <Aydarkzero> wait...
[0:52:45] <Crashfan01> wait is that what it means?!?!

[0:54:49] <%Ashenik1> Does he like it?
[0:54:49] <%BallerSwagBro9k> DO IT
[0:54:49] <%RioGascar> IT IS DUAL MEANING
[0:54:50] <yeildingthought> Ok kojiminh. Kappa
[0:54:57] <%fingalights> Woolie can not deal with puns anymore
[0:54:58] <arikk42> oh shit, it's close
[0:54:58] <OkamiDude15> the p in strand is silent
[0:55:03] <+MrRabbles> Japan really loves its language goofs
[0:55:06] <nigawatts1988> Japanese really love puns.
[0:55:06] <xcompleasedad> Woolie is wrong? More at 8:00
[0:55:06] <+theAncopro> But see Player also starts with P THEREFORE
[0:55:07] <%Irridium> did you know, in Fire Emblem Three Houses, Byleth has the Crest of Flames. Which could also call an Emblem of Fire or... Fire Emblem
[0:55:09] <%RioGascar> yeah but YOU GO DOWN and the Phoenix DOWN brings you back up
[0:55:11] <Crashfan01> Y'all excited to fight nightmare houses in this game?
[0:55:11] <ZComiX> Its TOTALLY a pun, im with Mihn
[0:55:13] <+SuzakuRising> I figured out the Phoenix down thing pretty early in playing FF games.
[0:55:17] <+primax104> Genius Kojuminh
[0:55:28] <+jkobe34> then use the shortcuts
[0:55:31] <%jiggy_snipe> banter is great
[0:55:33] <Twichty> the banter is the best
[0:55:40] <%Grayhammatter> genius kojumbo
[0:55:45] <MAX116030> try shortcuts for that
[0:55:46] <@Solidus_113> Look at all that "water"
[0:55:46] <+captain_history> Given that in japanese is just Phoenix Tail, it's totally a intended translation pun.
[0:55:54] <+TheDankDemon> banter m8
[0:55:55] <nigawatts1988> And now the game becomes the Dark Souls of Final Fantasy games - IGN
[0:55:56] <kingkeldeo31> Has woolie used magic yet?
[0:55:56] <+ekimthegib> The remixes in the demo aren't too shabby
[0:56:01] <+JacknZack27> Try the shortcuts for that kind of thing
[0:56:12] <%FuqBoiSlim> cant wait for the Final Fantasy 7 combo MADs
[0:56:14] <bunnyscruff> The characters in 15 are so gooood
[0:56:15] <Aydarkzero> 15 Banter is so great but 7R is about to take it to a whole other level
[0:56:16] <nigawatts1988> Shinra must love Baja Blast
[0:56:20] <%jiggy_snipe> was Dragon Age the 1st rpg with character banter?

[0:56:29] <+flexin_apex> did IGN really say that
[0:56:31] <MAX116030> 20 minutes
[0:56:31] <%Ashenik1> @WoolieVersus puns historicaly were seen as a sign of inteligence and were quite popular. Maybe Japan likes it too right now cause they kind of modernized later than western nations. :p
[0:56:34] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> @jiggy_snipe Baldur's Gate 1
[0:56:36] <OkamiDude15> final fantasy 7 really makes you feel like an eco terrori- wait
[0:56:41] <+TheDankDemon> robanus time Kreygasm
[0:56:42] <%jiggy_snipe> @Damashi_The_Kaotic ok cool
[0:56:51] <nigawatts1988> no IGN will say that when they review the game. You know they will.

[0:58:59] <nigawatts1988> Also reloading overcharge at the end of Barret's regular burst is the best way to do it DPS wise.
[0:59:00] <%jiggy_snipe> interuppted
[0:59:01] <bunnyscruff> @nigawatts1988 But when playing the game you learn more about each character and how close they are
[0:59:01] <%supersugoisenpai1> interrupted
[0:59:05] <+ekimthegib> Interrupts are a thing
[0:59:05] <aero160h> you need at bars to use abilities and spells in battle

[0:59:21] <+nekodelic> @ashenik1 nah, Japanese wordplay became culturally important because of the writing system. it's still popular because it's a nice way to convey nuanced ideas in simple ways

[1:01:35] <+JacknZack27> Lightning is for cowards
[1:01:38] <rheviel> all that lightning magic
[1:01:38] <+Cardz_> Thunder is a crutch for bad players
[1:01:40] <nigawatts1988> Thunder right now would hit like a truck
[1:01:44] <arikk42> Lightning
[1:01:47] <hntronium> Lightning is for losers who play 13
[1:01:48] <Dragon_Batman> Barret is now the healer

[1:02:09] <+solzan2000> lol
[1:02:09] <%fingalights> This battle system feels so chaotic when you first play. It gets easier after a run or two
[1:02:13] <+yeeter_baelish> lightning is for cowards
[1:02:17] <MAX116030> Woolie is true FG guy, screw spells just go in with fist for over 30 minutes

[1:07:26] <%RioGascar> in combat its all tips
[1:07:27] <@Solidus_113> Potions are stronger than your healing
[1:07:32] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> look at ALL of those POTIONS LUL
[1:07:32] <+NotHereToStream> 350 for potion
[1:07:33] <%fingalights> Yeah, its easy to forget out guard
[1:07:33] <MayorRev> oh no
[1:07:33] <b_ikki> we might get to see whether the fight has checkpoints
[1:07:33] <goose_attack_almanac> Has Woolie used Lightning magic at all yet
[1:07:34] <+yeeter_baelish> POTIONS ARE FOR COWARDS
[1:07:36] <%jiggy_snipe> use your potions instead of cure, it's better anyway
[1:07:38] <MayorRev> is woolie having the goblins?
[1:07:39] <%DatAsuna> but what if he neds them later? :P
[1:07:39] <$razielhex> hahahaha this is amazing Scrubbery
[1:07:41] <sototsiris> LUL
[1:07:43] <+theAncopro> this is like pat with ammo, but unintentional
[1:07:44] <%RioGascar> what if he needs them later in the DEMO guys
[1:07:44] <%FuqBoiSlim> why did minh tell him to use cure
[1:07:46] <rubbishbinge> He used thunder once successfully
[1:07:50] <black_pariah> This isnt lp tax this is LP REPO!
[1:07:51] <Wild_Samurai> I blame the early advice to use Barrets cure
[1:07:55] <%FuqBoiSlim> HE HAS LIKE 25 ALLL
[1:07:57] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @OkamiDude15
[1:07:57] <+NotHereToStream> woolie don't want to use potions..made by al bhed DansGame
[1:07:59] <+huggablemantooth> Woolie needs to be verbally reprimanded for playing so bad
[1:08:03] <%DatAsuna> Gotta finish the demo with max items
[1:08:06] <+huggablemantooth> he needs to know
[1:08:07] <+Nobrev> potion heals for the same amount as cure right?
[1:08:10] <+ekimthegib> psaBig Health
[1:08:12] <Prevot> this is just a demo, not like you're gonna keep the items afterwards
[1:08:15] <nigawatts1988> block don't roll on that
[1:08:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> This slowing effect in fights is gonna be a godsend for SuhniLegends
[1:08:19] <kingkeldeo31> "But what if I need the Potions for later in the demo?" - Woolie, probably
[1:08:19] <%Irridium> potion heals more
[1:08:20] <rubbishbinge> I wish the bomb timer was going
[1:08:21] <$razielhex> @DatAsuna That's literally something Pat would do; get x99 of every item
[1:08:21] <%jiggy_snipe> potions heal for more
[1:08:22] <+caffienatedjedi> What if he needs all 99x potions for the next boss?
[1:08:23] <+theAncopro> DMC this is not
[1:08:26] <%fingalights> Who uses Items for action games
[1:08:28] <%gatorafan> but chat, what if you need the potions later? daedra1DrunkTibs
[1:08:29] <iamtheTwitchghost> pat didn't want to use items in this demo either
[1:08:36] <iamtheTwitchghost> but that's just pat
[1:08:36] <rheviel> He might need those potions for later guys, HOLD THOSE ITEMS Pat would be proud.
[1:08:43] <@Solidus_113> information
[1:08:46] <%RioGascar> woolie this is not an action game
[1:08:49] <SailingSaturn> FF14 cirD
[1:08:51] <Lord_maxios> woolie is UFCKING BLIND MAN GIVE HIM SOME GLASSES
[1:08:52] <Xelhesia> yup
[1:08:53] <ZComiX> Pat used potions
[1:08:54] <wix964> how blind are these fuckers
[1:08:54] <@Solidus_113> also check the touchpad here
[1:08:54] <+Nobrev> EVEN PAT USED POTIONS
[1:08:56] <OkamiDude15> woolie is having an overload of info
[1:08:57] <Iwashi94> why...
[1:08:57] <Dragon_Batman> Pat did use some potions
[1:09:03] <$razielhex> THUNDER. FEEL THE THUNDER. Lightning and the THUNDER.
[1:09:04] <%fingalights> Yey, its them doing the move, even basic attacks
[1:09:04] <Lord_maxios> PAT IS BETTER GAMER SOME HOW
[1:09:07] <wookie5358> His eyes are probably just elsewhere
[1:09:07] <Lord_maxios> WOOLIE COME ON
[1:09:09] <thesoothe> There is a lot of info that they don't explain or it's kinda hard to see...
[1:09:10] <arikk42> Don't waste MANA on Cure
[1:09:12] <+heartbbyy> so its kingdom hearts combat FailFish
[1:09:20] <nigawatts1988> he's looking for Jessie in the rafters
[1:09:24] <+huggablemantooth> this shit is so simple its mind boggling how bad woolie is
[1:09:24] <%RioGascar> man that polygon tweet of a guy getting overwhelmed by information might be correct
[1:09:25] <rubbishbinge> Pressured, use thunder
[1:09:30] <%DatAsuna> This is making me miss the ffx lp
[1:09:32] <rubbishbinge> aaaaugh
[1:09:32] <Lord_maxios> its not kingdom hearts combat at all
[1:09:36] <rheviel> it's all cool
[1:09:38] <ThatGuyThere03> Why do people get offended when you call this KH combat?
[1:09:39] <@Solidus_113> Use Overcharge for ATB
[1:09:41] <%jinking79> who give a shit least the game coming out
[1:09:41] <ZComiX> To be fair he has to pay attention to Reggie and Minh as well
[1:09:41] <%jiggy_snipe> it's more grounded KH comabt
[1:09:42] <@Solidus_113> the game told you
[1:09:44] <%fingalights> It cues attacks, I guess so you don't mash
[1:09:47] <%jiggy_snipe> combat*
[1:09:47] <Lord_maxios> also kH2 ROCKED DUDE WHATCHU ON
[1:09:50] <nigawatts1988> Thunder+Stinger is the best combo...and Overcharge everytime it's up for Barret
[1:09:51] <b_ikki> people dont get offended it's just wrong lol
[1:09:52] <+Nobrev> NotLikeThis
[1:09:53] <+yeeter_baelish> kh combat dangBRUH
[1:09:56] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> @ThatGuyThere03 i reckon cuz it's different? like... KH combat is good but this doesn't feel like that at all
[1:10:02] <%gatorafan> Kimari would have just pushed the robot Keepo
[1:10:04] <toomuchsnarf> Damn just got here
[1:10:10] <OkamiDude15> i dont know what kind of kingdom hearts game you saw that played like this nkoThink
[1:10:14] <b_ikki> both kh and this play well but they're different
[1:10:15] <wookie5358> It's KH combat with a twist. I guess simply calling it KH combat is accurate, but not the full picture
[1:10:20] <nigawatts1988> this is nothing like KH
[1:10:20] <+ekimthegib> it's closer to KH than it is to OG 7 at least
[1:10:25] <%netrac> Imagine if the timer was running
[1:10:25] <%RioGascar> Woolie i want you to ask a question. WOULD A BOSS FIGHT BE THIS LONG?
[1:10:26] <kingkeldeo31> At least we get to see all this juicy dialogue
[1:10:27] <nigawatts1988> If I had to compare it to something it would be Crisis Core
[1:10:27] <jaygee303> The bomb would have blown up at this point
[1:10:32] <Lord_maxios> any action game is kh combat with a twist dude what
[1:10:32] <%RioGascar> The first boss in the game
[1:10:32] <+heartbbyy> its the dark souls of kingdom hearts games
[1:10:36] <DXLelouch24> Spend your atb it builds fast
[1:10:38] <+thackattack00> It's real time action combat with a command menu. Of course it has differences to KH but to say they're nothing alike is crazy
[1:10:39] <Xelhesia> KH combat is more floaty and lacks impact
[1:10:40] <Wild_Samurai> No items, no magic, no limit, no cover, no dodge
[1:10:40] <%RioGascar> and its like
[1:10:43] <Saltmeisterr> all that matters is that its better than 15
[1:10:43] <$razielhex> should have set that timer for 45 minutes
[1:10:43] <%linSP> This is like mmo combat
[1:10:43] <+Cardz_> Lightning is bad, just hit it with your sword
[1:10:46] <%RioGascar> 1 hr long
[1:10:46] <Lord_maxios> USE ATB PLEAE
[1:10:46] <%Kriss1827> this is crisis core gameplay but good
[1:10:47] <iamtheTwitchghost> @nigawatts1988 yeah
[1:10:47] <xcompleasedad> They specifically did not set the timer.
[1:10:49] <Zebroneath> Try to use Thunder after the laser.
[1:10:50] <OkamiDude15> crisis core but refined
[1:10:55] <+Ahegaliant> I thought there was going to be a turn-based mode?
[1:10:55] <rubbishbinge> Fire
[1:11:04] <wookie5358> With less modulation and phases
[1:11:04] <+captain_history> I think I finished him before he did the tail laser 3 times
[1:11:07] <Dragon_Batman> It still is KH inspired either way, shure it doesn't feel the exact same but there are similarites
[1:11:11] <+Nobrev> THUNDER
[1:11:13] <+huggablemantooth> pathetic
[1:11:21] <Solidnick18> final phase
[1:11:23] <%RioGascar> i think they need to alter the game to set the bomb so people realize they cant spend 15 mins on 1 boss
[1:11:30] <%Ashenik1> FF7 Remake is Kingdom Hearts of Final Fantasy games
[1:11:30] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:11:31] <wookie5358> There are similarities for sure, but you're calling bloodborne dark souls
[1:11:33] <wix964> Woolie does not understand the concept of commanding the character he isn't controlling
[1:11:33] <%FuqBoiSlim> you did it....
[1:11:35] <%fingalights> @Ahegaliant there kind of is, Classic mode
[1:11:36] <Solidnick18> the legs
[1:11:38] <$razielhex> HOLY SHIT HE PICKED IT
[1:11:40] <eldragon_1> Max was saying last night how it's almost impossible to get multiple LB LUL
[1:11:46] <nigawatts1988> The point of the boss is to stagger it, then do big damage. To stagger it fast is Stinger and Lightning. Then when it's staggered, Punsher Mode, Braver, and Thunder again.
[1:11:46] <Dragon_Batman> The bomb timer hasn't actually started yet
[1:11:47] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> @Ahegaliant the "turn based" mode is basically where the game plays itself as far as movement and general attacks to build ATB, then when the gauge is full it slows like whenever woolie opens the menus
[1:11:53] <kingkeldeo31> Cloud has 30 mp and he hasn't used fire once?
[1:11:53] <Wild_Samurai> Bloodborne is Dark Souls tho
[1:11:54] <MattoBii> punisher mode for big damage
[1:11:55] <OkamiDude15> @Ahegaliant its more of an automode. characters are controlled by ai but you issue commands with the atb bar they build up. not sure how good it is though
[1:12:03] <+ekimthegib> played the demo twice and never got Barrett's Limit
[1:12:21] <black_pariah> woolie there's no style meter here stop trying to stunt on the boss
[1:12:26] <%RioGascar> does anyone know if woolie uses magic in games that its available as an option?
[1:12:30] <nigawatts1988> You have to stay on him. I did this fight as completely Barrett and got his LB
[1:12:31] <+Ahegaliant> Eh? So it's like ff15?
[1:12:35] <gamefan6219> Where's wooliie's dreads?
[1:12:41] <OkamiDude15> its not like 15
[1:12:44] <Saltmeisterr> Clap
[1:12:46] <wookie5358> It's 15 minus the training wheels
[1:12:47] <Dragon_Batman> It's similar
[1:12:47] <ireliaismaiwaifu> woolie never using barret's atb lol
[1:12:49] <Lord_maxios> its ff15 BUT WAAAAY BETTER
[1:12:50] <Lord_maxios> like
[1:12:52] <nigawatts1988> and honestly Barret has an easier time in this fight then Cloud
[1:12:54] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> @Ahegaliant not like XV imo
[1:12:54] <Wild_Samurai> Limits are more generous if you play poorly. Not a critique an observation I saw yesterday
[1:12:55] <Lord_maxios> actually good ff 15
[1:12:58] <%fingalights> @Ahegaliant the classic mode, Maybe? Idk
[1:12:59] <+ekimthegib> PokPikachu
[1:13:00] <%RioGascar> 100 xp
[1:13:02] <+Nobrev> it's what ff14 should have been
[1:13:03] <spardanwarrior> Not at all, it doesn't have that weird auto-attack crap that 15 has
[1:13:04] <+Eddy21forsaken> woolie confirmed better than kotaku journalists
[1:13:06] <+yeeter_baelish> monkaS
[1:13:07] <%linSP> It’s like 15 but it’s not 15
[1:13:08] <%RioGascar> for 20 minute fight
[1:13:08] <+Nobrev> ff15*
[1:13:15] <Solidnick18> better run
[1:13:19] <+Cardz_> Good thing it just started otherwise woolie would be fucking dead
[1:13:22] <%FuqBoiSlim> NOT THE BAJA BLAST
[1:13:26] <%RioGascar> Oh now the timer starts
[1:13:28] <+caffienatedjedi> Would be great if the bomb still started before the fight.
[1:13:30] <AdmiralButtloaf> Good thing mako isnt flammable
[1:13:35] <chambatron> Didn;t woolie had a patron?
[1:13:38] <+captain_history> It's XV but better and the attacks feeling like actual attacks.
[1:13:38] <chambatron> !patron
[1:13:45] <Ranko2Danko> is that the secretary from metal chaos wolf on the bomb?
[1:13:45] <MattoBii> it's pretty close, at least
[1:13:47] <nigawatts1988> That Scorpion gets to drink unlimited Baja Blast now...who really won this fight?
[1:13:49] <randominternetsurfer> Woolie plays so badly that'd I'd mistake him for a game journalist.
[1:13:50] <arikk42> Of Course it is
[1:13:54] <%Chichen> sprinttttt
[1:13:57] <%jiggy_snipe> lol
[1:14:00] <Dragon_Batman> He's got time
[1:14:02] <%Double_Tap_That> I just realized the countdown timer is comprised of Nixie tubes.
[1:14:03] <OkamiDude15> ff7 plays like ff7
[1:14:03] <kingkeldeo31> The timer stops for conversations which is nice
[1:14:05] <black_pariah> cloud learning from mihn the way of the sandbag
[1:14:07] <OkamiDude15> evo19MindBlown
[1:14:09] <Wild_Samurai> FF15 was all QTE Boss fights
[1:14:15] <%Ashenik1> IS combat better than in FF15?
[1:14:20] <%gatorafan> we escape cooly woolieMIRIN
[1:14:20] <gamefan6219> Did Woolie cut his hair?
[1:14:20] <+thackattack00> yes
[1:14:20] <+Nobrev> you could slow walk through this part and still have enough time
[1:14:24] <Wild_Samurai> Leviathan “boss”
[1:14:27] <randominternetsurfer> @ashenik1 yes
[1:14:28] <yeildingthought> “Bosses” in FF15 LUL
[1:14:29] <+ekimthegib> Definitely better than 15
[1:14:31] <%fingalights> @Ashenik1 Yes,
[1:14:31] <Saltmeisterr> very better
[1:14:32] <tigerstyle96> Ads?
[1:14:33] <%RioGascar> Wait has woolie once used magic in this demo?
[1:14:35] <arikk42> it takes 6
[1:14:40] <%FuqBoiSlim> it's better than xv for one reason. when I hit the attack button cloud swings his weapon instead of running in a half circle and then a full circle and then swinging his weapon
[1:14:40] <wookie5358> I like this combat a lot more than FF15, but I'm sure there will be people who say otherwise
[1:14:41] <nigawatts1988> 20 minutes is incredibly forgiving..need a 10 minute choice.
[1:14:42] <$razielhex> leave her
[1:14:43] <Dragon_Batman> Yea it is better than ff15, even the Royal edition, though Devil Trigger Armiger is great
[1:14:48] <gamefan6219> She's trapped. :O
[1:14:52] <wookie5358> The demo's free if you have a PS4; I'd say go t ry it if you can and you're curious
[1:14:58] <Solidnick18> Sploosh
[1:15:00] <$razielhex> titty armor failed
[1:15:01] <%fingalights> @Ashenik1 just from this early game, its better. It may get more as time goes on
[1:15:03] <%DatAsuna> in the frozen time
[1:15:03] <+BionoidLCR> TwitchUnity
[1:15:03] <arikk42> it's better than xv for one reason because i never played XV
[1:15:11] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> ffXV is just item spam with no consequence and no real combo impact, but in 7remake the combos feel like they have weight, you can charge attacks to do AoE or heavy hits, you can change stances, you can only use items/magic if you have ATB which you build through hitting or blocking, and you can only store 2 atb so you have to make the moves count
[1:15:11] <+Nobrev> @riogascar he has been almost exclusively using cure instead of potions
[1:15:11] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I mean yeah, she looks pretty alright
[1:15:12] <+BionoidLCR> jessie best girl
[1:15:14] <OkamiDude15> woolie has used magic but not to the best of its ability
[1:15:18] <+yeeter_baelish> jessie lionNice
[1:15:22] <Saltmeisterr> titty armor is a scourge upon this earth
[1:15:28] <Dragon_Batman> Woolie turned Barret into the healer
[1:15:39] <%FuqBoiSlim> titty armor is pretty based tbh
[1:15:45] <Wild_Samurai> 15 was alright yet somehow the last 2 hours or so was the best storytelling in any video game. Prove me wrong lol
[1:15:45] <@Solidus_113> holding sprint on ladders will make you ascend/descend faster
[1:15:51] <Lionkevinson> Rendons nous
[1:15:51] <Quietshun13> I got no issues with titty armor
[1:15:55] <BaslerJones> Jessie Kreygasm

[1:15:57] <DreamPhantasyTV> titty armor looks badass

[1:16:02] <ImmaCanuck> titty armor sfoxLOL
[1:16:05] <OldManDeckardCain> titty armor is worth it just to see people get super mad about it LUL
[1:16:05] <%Kriss1827> titty armor is dope
[1:16:06] <DreamPhantasyTV> hon honhon hon
[1:16:06] <$razielhex> it's awful and dumb.
[1:16:08] <RogerPoore> @WoolieVersus Jessie is voiced by Futaba, always a redhead
[1:16:11] <Lionkevinson> Rendons-nous is the proper way
[1:16:13] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Titty armor is for people too cowardly to admire the true beauty of well designed armor
[1:16:18] <rubbishbinge> If VIIR took anything from XV, I'd like directional attacks, even if it's just aesthetic
[1:16:18] <+dnajones> It is really bothering me that Woolie keeps not sprinting up and down the ladders lol
[1:16:19] <aero160h> hold the right shoulder button, which is also ur dash button, to slide down ladders or climb faster/run
[1:16:20] <+nekodelic> @tonypullmydtredgrave while it is better than XV, you are oversimplifying the combat way too much
[1:16:25] <yeildingthought> You are actually LUL
[1:16:33] <Mrbaconator> no, bikini armor is stupid. jessies armor is fine
[1:16:33] <%linSP> What is this franç talk
[1:16:36] <Vertigheist> Real armor is for people who wanna look fat
[1:16:42] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> @nekodelic you can hold circle and the game plays itself. Noctis will literally run up to the nearest thing and play the game himself.
[1:16:45] <wookie5358> She had titty armor in the original; it would be "censorship" if she didn't have it here
[1:16:46] <Wild_Samurai> Items, no magic, no limit, no dodge, NO SPRINT
[1:16:49] <+yeeter_baelish> youuuu
[1:16:49] <Quietshun13> YOUUUUU
[1:16:50] <nigawatts1988> the real problem is there is a cup for each boob so it looks ridiculous.
[1:16:53] <+BionoidLCR> youuuuuuu
[1:16:53] <Solidnick18> YOUUU
[1:16:55] <shiny_prinny> YOUUUU
[1:16:57] <Laironx3> Soulja Boy!
[1:16:57] <$razielhex> They're both dumb and impractical Bacon
[1:16:58] <Ion_Laser> YOUUUUUU
[1:16:58] <Saltmeisterr> yooooouu
[1:16:58] <%FenixSeraph> YOUUUUUUUUUU
[1:17:00] <%FenixSeraph> SUPERMAN THAT HO
[1:17:02] <%Exiliator> YOOOOUUUU
[1:17:06] <+Ahegaliant> Ridiculously hot c;
[1:17:07] <Ultimatefool> Bitch I look like GOKU
[1:17:11] <@Solidus_113> all this free ATB
[1:17:14] <DreamPhantasyTV> it gets cramped
[1:17:17] <wookie5358> No ATB challenge run
[1:17:19] <+doittoit_sa> impractical like a sword the size of a human
[1:17:22] <+yeeter_baelish> taking more than 5 seconds LuL
[1:17:24] <Snakes_dk> i tried to dodge offset in this
[1:17:25] <+Eddy21forsaken> ATB is for cowards
[1:17:26] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> @nekodelic and i mean, i like XV and all, i put over 300 hours into it, but the combat in that game IS simple.
[1:17:29] <+ArtOlivero> can we play as tifa in this demo?
[1:17:30] <+Qsmash_> even the robots
[1:17:32] <%RioGascar> he is really fixated on 5 seconds
[1:17:37] <$razielhex> It's not his sword @doittoit_sa
[1:17:38] <+primax104> @ArtOlivero nope
[1:17:38] <+ekimthegib> Evaporate into someone's gas tank
[1:17:38] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> @ArtOlivero not in this demo no :/
[1:17:40] <%RioGascar> said it on the lift too
[1:17:42] <+doittoit_sa> rofl
[1:17:42] <MattoBii> it's such a crisis core thing
[1:17:44] <Wild_Samurai> Cloud keeps bringing up 5 seconds like that Colossus speech from Deadpool
[1:17:45] <OkamiDude15> impractical like cloud's SINGLE PAULDRON
[1:17:49] <%FuqBoiSlim> bro wheres the DT Distortion???
[1:17:51] <Aydarkzero> @ArtOlivero it's only the Mako Reactor
[1:17:52] <rubbishbinge> Demo is done in a few minutes
[1:17:57] <arikk42> but why is the world isn't cutting like in MGR ?
[1:17:59] <nigawatts1988> everything in this is a Crisis Core thing..makes me think I'll replay it.
[1:18:00] <+ArtOlivero> oh ok thanks all
[1:18:03] <%gatorafan> just turn into fartgas
[1:18:04] <Xelhesia> 10 does it
[1:18:04] <%linSP> Last I heard of Soulja was his bootleg console
[1:18:11] <%jiggy_snipe> FFX for instance
[1:18:12] <+nekodelic> @tonypullmydtredgrave have you tried fighting high level enemies in the game? just holding circle is not enough against lv 99+ bosses
[1:18:14] <Talinu> In FFX iit's a plot thing.
[1:18:15] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Sure, FFX for example
[1:18:18] <+Cardz_> HE'S LEARNING
[1:18:23] <+primax104> well this is the long awaited sequel to Crisis Core after all :P
[1:18:28] <Saltmeisterr> oh god I forgot about his bootleg console
[1:18:31] <wookie5358> I kind of wish the fade was red like in the original, but green is okay too
[1:18:32] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:18:37] <NiktenKing> Ok... but why not for Aerith. These guys get fizzled immediately tho
[1:18:38] <Acecorleone> FF10 did it and those 2 games are linked by lore
[1:18:38] <OkamiDude15> people die and yuna dances SourPls when will yuna stop dancing
[1:18:43] <DreamPhantasyTV> can you say honhonhon?
[1:18:47] <+Cardz_> Never SourPls
[1:18:48] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> @nekodelic honestly it is if you decide to abuse the fact that there's no downside for items. Like, if you go in with 99 potions/ethers/exlixers etc, you can turn any fight into a battle of attrition
[1:18:50] <+ekimthegib> This game gets on a whole other level when you get used to the shortcuts
[1:18:56] <MillaMoks> "you learn the game" ... not if you work for Kotaku it seems XD
[1:19:00] <OkamiDude15> SourPls not until sin is defeated
[1:19:07] <$razielhex> Woolie isgonna get this game and play Aerith like a Hapkido Cane master
[1:19:09] <fen6> did they try shortcuts in combat?
[1:19:14] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> @nekodelic not that that's how you SHOULD play or anything i'm just saying that it is possible to make that game simple as hell because there's no consequence for doing so. this game forces you to put in effort.
[1:19:15] <+Eddy21forsaken> did they explain the ATB shortcuts to Woolie?
[1:19:20] <+nekodelic> @tonypullmydtredgrave in that case, you're absolutely right
[1:19:21] <@Solidus_113> the boys
[1:19:23] <rubbishbinge> @fen6 not even once
[1:19:25] <haisho> if FFX is a very early prequel....Al Bhed?
[1:19:27] <OkamiDude15> shortcuts were brought up by mihn but never used
[1:19:29] <+BionoidLCR> @razielhex everyone knows Aerith fights like Rolento LUL
[1:19:38] <Wild_Samurai> No items, no magic, no limit, no dodge, no sprint, NO LEARN THE GAME
[1:19:38] <+lethallunacyx> Ether the shit that makes your soul burn slow.
[1:19:44] <DreamPhantasyTV> Love the dialog , sounds very 90s
[1:20:01] <Dragon_Batman> Hey he got to see a bit of the air stuff
[1:20:06] <fen6> @rubbishbinge oh really.. they are really fun BibleThump
[1:20:18] <wookie5358> Happy festival fireworks? @haisho
[1:20:22] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> @nekodelic and like i said, i love the game tbh. I try to make it more interesting by switching weapons mid combo and stuff but it's just like.. permanent easy mode knowing that there's no risk as long as you have items, and since it's so easy to make money, there's no reason to not be stacked up to the 99's on everything :/
[1:20:26] <gamefan6219> Cloud is so EDGY
[1:20:27] <+croxeye> oh hey Woolie, the camera can be zoomed way out in the settings for a bit better view
[1:20:29] <TungstenViper> @DreamPhantasyTV what does that mean?
[1:20:51] <@Solidus_113> potion refusal
[1:20:52] <Dragon_Batman> Just use the potions
[1:20:55] <OkamiDude15> NO ITEMS ONLY MAGIC
[1:20:56] <+croxeye> cloud is trying desperately to look cool, vs being edgy
[1:20:58] <+ekimthegib> I like the stance mechanic for cloud
[1:20:59] <$razielhex> White Mage Barrett
[1:21:00] <rubbishbinge> Potion't
[1:21:01] <+lethallunacyx> I can
[1:21:04] <%gatorafan> NEVER daedra1DrunkTibs
[1:21:09] <MayorRev> I said this on pat's stream but i think i can enjoy Edgy but insecure Cloud
[1:21:12] <SubjectX07x> Man that's the blackest white mage I ever saeen.
[1:21:12] <kingkeldeo31> It's a DEMO, use your items dang it
[1:21:14] <+MrRabbles> Potions are a product of capitalism
[1:21:17] <MayorRev> nice choice of character
[1:21:19] <Snakes_dk> it runs surprisingly well on ps4 slim
[1:21:19] <+Qsmash_> no meter
[1:21:21] <wookie5358> Potiongate
[1:21:26] <arikk42> Action Man
[1:21:28] <+lethallunacyx> I can't wait until we start seeing comet and ultima magic. Way way later
[1:21:29] <DreamPhantasyTV> Their conversation and mannerisms sounds similar to the original
[1:21:29] <rheviel> atb
[1:21:32] <+ekimthegib> noice
[1:21:39] <OkamiDude15> cloud who tries to act cooler than he is
[1:21:42] <%gatorafan> each potion you consume funds SHINRA daedra1DrunkTibs
[1:21:45] <+MrRabbles> Barrett's Cure comes right from the lifestream itself
[1:21:47] <%linSP> You never know when you might need those 99 potions woolieMIRIN
[1:21:48] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Barret is morally opposed to potions because Shinra makes them :)
[1:21:51] <rubbishbinge> These guys are parry bait
[1:21:55] <%FuqBoiSlim> use the guard counter on these guys
[1:22:00] <+nekodelic> @tonypullmydtredgrave yeah, the item system fucks it up. I purposefully never had a full stack of items, so that's why it felt better
[1:22:07] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> Fun fact, if you use cloud's Punisher mode here, you can block those dudes and their stagger gauge will fill like crazy
[1:22:16] <+ekimthegib> these guys are a bit of a step up
[1:22:17] <+VHGS> they are also weak to fire
[1:22:20] <WhatsSoupy> so bad
[1:22:22] <+ekimthegib> wish they show up earlier
[1:22:23] <rubbishbinge> whiff
[1:22:43] <BaslerJones> is there a parry mechanic or something in this
[1:22:49] <+ekimthegib> Made it in less than 10 minutes too
[1:22:55] <+MrRabbles> status items exist and yet there is still illness in the world. Down with Shinra
[1:22:57] <OkamiDude15> punisher mode turns your block into a counter state
[1:22:59] <+nekodelic> arisen 'tis weak to fire
[1:23:00] <+DreyfussFrost> Yes, Woolie just forgot about it.
[1:23:01] <Psyramics> no parry mechanic. might be a materia that adds it
[1:23:07] <@Solidus_113> no parry only counter
[1:23:08] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> @nekodelic yeah playing without items makes the game alot better- ESPECIALLY after they patched in the party member switch mechanic. limiting heals to iggy's regroup and using the team guage for balancing damage and recovery makes it more intense
[1:23:08] <Dragon_Batman> Punisher mode has a counter when holding block, or you can press triangle at the right time
[1:23:09] <wookie5358> If you block melee in punisher
[1:23:13] <+DreyfussFrost> Block while in Punisher Mode will counter melee attacks.
[1:23:14] <trueherobappo> Yes
[1:23:14] <+Nobrev> @baslerjones blocking with punisher stance auto counters
[1:23:16] <Xelhesia> just block in punisher mode
[1:23:17] <+JacknZack27> Yeah
[1:23:18] <%fingalights> Counter on block in punisher mode
[1:23:19] <%SomersaultJustice> it did mention in the tutorial
[1:23:20] <jeffthesequel> Yes
[1:23:23] <+Qsmash_> in Punisher mode you can hold block to counter
[1:23:23] <haisho> it's not taught in the demo
[1:23:25] <MayorRev> aaaaand time
[1:23:27] <gamefan6219> tHAT guy has a smart phone?
[1:23:27] <MayorRev> gg
[1:23:32] <black_pariah> FALSE FLAG
[1:23:32] <+fowlfolk> Shinraphone
[1:23:35] <DXLelouch24> Switch to punisher when attacked to parry you can do it standing ther or mid combo
[1:23:35] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> @WoolieVersus blocking in punisher mode when a melee enemy hits you auto counter/parries
[1:23:35] <$razielhex> the bomb was a dud?
[1:23:37] <+DreyfussFrost> There WAS a tutorial, it was part of the Punisher Mode tutorial.
[1:23:39] <%gatorafan> I don't quite like this moment
[1:23:40] <$razielhex> hahaha oooh this is going places
[1:23:43] <+captain_history> IT WAS ALL A SETUP
[1:23:44] <%netrac> INSIDE JOB
[1:23:44] <black_pariah> SHINRA WAS AN INSIDE JOB
[1:23:45] <+ekimthegib> It's in the tutorial message for Punisher mode
[1:23:47] <Duke_of_HI> Jessies bomb doesn't melt Mako Reactors
[1:23:49] <heartlesshealer> counter stance in Punisher is what people are saying
[1:23:50] <RottenK> FALSE FLAG
[1:23:51] <Wild_Samurai> Parry by holding block. NOT timing based
[1:23:51] <MayorRev> INSIDE JOB
[1:23:53] <Dragon_Batman> If your in operator mode you can press triangle just before getting hit and it will counter
[1:23:59] <kingkeldeo31> Avalanche not actual terrorists
[1:24:00] <+JacknZack27> I really like this addition
[1:24:00] <Dragon_Batman> Punisher mode
[1:24:01] <%jiggy_snipe> Sector 1 was an inside job
[1:24:03] <+DreyfussFrost> @woolieversus There was a tutorial on parrying as part of Punisher Mode.
[1:24:06] <gamefan6219> Cloud just chilling
[1:24:08] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> yeah you just hold it it's not frame perfect or anything
[1:24:11] <Naphtali61> Mako fuel doesn't melt steel beams
[1:24:12] <+kyh9> Barrett thinking about his daughter
[1:24:17] <Ultimatefool> Mako can't melt steel beams
[1:24:17] <Snakes_dk> good scene
[1:24:21] <MayorRev> he fell asleep
[1:24:22] <wookie5358> Jessie didn't want to wipe out a neighboring city
[1:24:23] <goose_attack_almanac> Diid woolie just missthat ntire thing
[1:24:26] <@Solidus_113> it's a counter
[1:24:28] <+captain_history> to be fair even in the og game they say the bomb was stronger they expected
[1:24:28] <+DreyfussFrost> Yes that is the parry.
[1:24:29] <%fingalights> Its counter
[1:24:30] <OkamiDude15> its a counter
[1:24:33] <arikk42> Woolie this is not SEKIRO !
[1:24:33] <chambatron> You can turn off the shake
[1:24:36] <+flexin_apex> @ultimatefool lol
[1:24:38] <AMaidIndeed> counter stance
[1:24:41] <+DreyfussFrost> Okay, it's a counter. No perfect blocks.
[1:24:50] <%netrac> Woolie missed the entire thing
[1:24:54] <toomuchsnarf> You can switch stances
[1:24:54] <gamefan6219> This remake looks beautiful
[1:24:55] <%fingalights> You can switch to counter quick from Operator to Punisher
[1:24:55] <+caffienatedjedi> Jessie getting all the falling debris
[1:24:59] <heartlesshealer> If you want a moon of mahakhala, that may or may not be a materia in full game. We'll just have to wait and see
[1:25:05] <+VHGS> Yeah there's no Just Defend-style mechanic like Lightning Returns, at least so far.
[1:25:06] <Wild_Samurai> Translation error. The targeting D-Pad needs better translation as well
[1:25:06] <+DreyfussFrost> Yeah no Just Defends AFAIK.
[1:25:07] <Zbyrd0961> no you cannot royal guard just yet
[1:25:08] <+Nobrev> @woolie press triangle in operator mode right before getting hit to do the punisher counter
[1:25:08] <toomuchsnarf> Perfectly
[1:25:08] <@Solidus_113> he loves being called cool
[1:25:12] <%linSP> Aren’t there perfect blocks
[1:25:12] <+rednecked__crake> :)
[1:25:13] <Prevot> LOOK AT THIS LOSER
[1:25:13] <Naphtali61> Avalanche sanitized, you can feel good about your protagonists gamers.
[1:25:17] <hntronium> he do cool
[1:25:17] <SHADIC7> I hope you can get a parry in the full game
[1:25:17] <cdev57> You missed Jessie being a thit
[1:25:21] <Iggeh0> did everyone see how big his dick was just there
[1:25:21] <gamefan6219> Wasn't that from the trailer
[1:25:21] <Snakes_dk> monkaS
[1:25:21] <%Exiliator> You're pretty good
[1:25:24] <MattoBii> I saw a smiiiiiile
[1:25:24] <cdev57> Thot
[1:25:26] <MayorRev> gg
[1:25:27] <NiktenKing> He smirked
[1:25:27] <ImmaCanuck> Wow, protagonist, that was totally tubular! sfoxYOO
[1:25:27] <Xelhesia> that smirk kills me everytime
[1:25:29] <MAX116030> I dont get why people are pissed at this scene? According to Maximillian old game had dialogue where Jessie had no idea that explosion will be this huge so they did not plan for such effect so it kinda in the same effect
[1:25:29] <+TheFabledAble> @WoolieVersus I heard that if you go into the pause mode for actions RIGHT as you block an attack, your action you assign in the paused mode will act as a counter/parry?
[1:25:30] <Zebroneath> If you switch to Punisher Mode just before an enemy hits, that does count as a counter.
[1:25:31] <%CheekiBreeki27> Can't wait to play as Jessie in the full game :)
[1:25:37] <%BallerSwagBro9k> MIHN IS CLOUD?
[1:25:37] <%jiggy_snipe> thanks Minh

[1:25:41] <OkamiDude15> @linSP just defends in some fighting games but in this game not really
[1:25:41] <Graxe_> The reactor blowing up was an inside job
[1:25:42] <+NotHereToStream> except not
[1:25:42] <rheviel> pretty boy smirk
[1:25:43] <%netrac> The inside jobs was implied
[1:25:44] <%Irridium> cloud can BARELY contain it
[1:25:47] <+captain_history> Also it will make sense for later
[1:25:49] <arikk42> man Woolie loves to miss everything
[1:25:50] <Wild_Samurai> Talking over THIS cutscene
[1:25:52] <%fingalights> So, it isn't?? Apparently it was hinted that it was allways SHinra
[1:25:52] <+NotHereToStream> wait wait
[1:25:54] <MattoBii> to be fair, there was a line before where Jessie said "I didn't think it'd be that strong"
[1:25:55] <MayorRev> EZ CLAP
[1:25:56] <+nekodelic> @tonypullmydtredgrave the fight against the lake lady was so good trying to actually not die
[1:25:57] <gamefan6219> How Long is this demo:
[1:25:58] <+captain_history> For what Shinra does later
[1:26:01] <%Chichen> INSIDE JOB
[1:26:02] <+ekimthegib> Demo's done
[1:26:04] <toomuchsnarf> It’s always insinuated right ?
[1:26:05] <%RJay80> doodOuch to be continued
[1:26:07] <law240> it's implied in the original too
[1:26:10] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> @nekodelic omega weapon was actually challenging too
[1:26:12] <Dragon_Batman> Shinra makes it worse than it really was
[1:26:14] <+Nero__Zone> they 9/11ed it
[1:26:15] <hntronium> There's implications in the original game
[1:26:15] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @MAX116030 Are people pissed? It just seems like a more explicit version of what was originally implied
[1:26:16] <haisho> it's insinuated in the original too
[1:26:18] <OkamiDude15> it was always insinuiated
[1:26:19] <%linSP> MAKO ENERGY MELTS STEEL BEAMS
[1:26:19] <dundore77> their goal was to blow it up the bomb didn't do it and shinra wanted to blame avalanche
[1:26:20] <whatatkins> But in the original jessie notices how her bomb shouldn't have caused as much damage as it did
[1:26:21] <MayorRev> ALEX NO

[1:26:53] <rubbishbinge> KADAJ
[1:26:53] <heartlesshealer> mindjacking

[1:26:54] <%FenixSeraph> PogChamp
[1:26:54] <%jiggy_snipe> idk if it was implied that shinra did but Jessie's bomb was not supposed to be this powerful
[1:26:55] <dundore77> iirc in the original they let avalanche get that far and just gave minor resistance.
[1:26:56] <%RioGascar> gulf of what??
[1:26:57] <SubjectX07x> Alex Jones would absolutely not be a Shinra Shill.

[1:27:55] <NiktenKing> Gun boi, sword boi, fist boi
[1:27:56] <MAX116030> @Valentinius_Anodyne oh YEAH people are really considering this to be a huge change though with context of later segment in remake the whole thing fits the narrative of old game
[1:27:56] <%Ipsenscastle> Yazoo is a milkshake
[1:27:58] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> @nekodelic lmfao yeah, there's like... certain weak spots but they trigger an enrage mode so it's rough, not to mention he can just become immune to your armiger unleashed finisher attacks so it's like O_O
[1:27:59] <Saltmeisterr> who is woolie talking avout?
[1:28:01] <%Bearded_Oracle> Bearded_Oracle subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:28:01] <haisho> imagine the 3 sephy-babies doing a 3-way Fusion Dance to turn into Sephiroth

[1:28:07] <Saltmeisterr> who is kadaj?
[1:28:07] <Djinnazz> “They’re Putin’ dumb apples in the water to make the Chocobos gay!!”
[1:28:07] <Wild_Samurai> This prelude sounds like FF14 tho
[1:28:12] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Had a damn good demo
[1:28:12] <@Solidus_113> And this is from an older build, Max played an updated one when he went to Square Enix
[1:28:13] <+karldeck> @Saltmeisterr Nier Automata
[1:28:18] <+DreyfussFrost> Can we just forget the extended universe ever happened please? FF7 deserves to get Disney retconned.
[1:28:19] <%fingalights> @Saltmeisterr Advent Children
[1:28:21] <%bread_assassin> According to Max, this is like a Nov. build.
[1:28:22] <acedeone> Advent Children
[1:28:22] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> @Saltmeisterr Kadaj is from Advent Children movie
[1:28:26] <+viredae> Are you just starting?
[1:28:26] <+ekimthegib> Didn't the OG demo have Bahaumut?
[1:28:26] <gamefan6219> stream over?
[1:28:28] <Saltmeisterr> oh
[1:28:40] <%jinking79> Coward waiting on the PS+ free game to buy this
[1:28:42] <@Solidus_113> FF7 demo stream over, new LP stream starting soon
[1:28:52] <Belutima> @solidus_113 yeah this sas from last November or December, and max played a Jan, February build.
[1:28:56] <gamefan6219> @Solidus_113 In april
[1:28:58] <acedeone> Is Crysis Core still Canon?
[1:28:59] <Wild_Samurai> Max is a know it all. I bet he even used potions
[1:29:06] <%bread_assassin> I see there being repeatable missions.
[1:29:07] <MayorRev> ?schedule
[1:29:19] <%jiggy_snipe> I imagine it will be like FF15
[1:29:19] <NocturnalScotsman> @bread_assassin it is, he actually showed stuff that was missing from the demo like flashbacks
[1:29:19] <Dragon_Batman> Totally
[1:29:20] <dundore77> pretty sure thats how ff15 works. dungeons are clear and done until you go back
[1:29:21] <+ekimthegib> @Acecorleone There's a reference or two in the demo, so maybe
[1:29:21] <@Solidus_113> Crisis Core is maximum canon now
[1:29:25] <%Ipsenscastle> @jinking79 good luck, there's no way Square would do that unless maybe it's the first episode once the whol thing is released
[1:29:29] <@Solidus_113> And Before Crisis is too
[1:29:34] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> @Acecorleone i'm pretty sure they're saying the entire extended universe isn't canon- this is going to be it's self contained thing afaik
[1:29:35] <rubbishbinge> FFXV world map killed my soul
[1:29:36] <MayorRev> !schedule
[1:29:36] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1234692167358177282?s=19
[1:29:38] <TungstenViper> I'm still triggered they didn include a "Part 1" in the title. it's so scummy
[1:29:38] <+DreyfussFrost> Noooo.... I'd rather not. That feels more limiting than liberating. Go ahead and abstract the overworld.
[1:29:41] <wookie5358> "100 GB of Midgar" is a current selling point
[1:29:42] <aero160h> it's funny listening to Woolie and Reg and Minh talk about this game as if it's fresh in their minds when it's not. they should just replay the original.
[1:29:46] <%fingalights> @Solidus_113 why is CC Cannon?
[1:29:49] <Wild_Samurai> They said nothing. Gotta sell those lies
[1:29:50] <%Kriss1827> crisis core has some good stuff in there
[1:29:54] <acedeone> Plus they need an FFX reference
[1:29:56] <@Solidus_113> Reasons
[1:29:57] <Belutima> @solidnick18 Ibam curious what they put in from Before crisis
[1:30:03] <+DreyfussFrost> The overworld can't actually be to scalr, it would be 90% empty.
[1:30:06] <+dbhaze83> Just starting or finishing?
[1:30:08] <rheviel> "I didn't pay attention" is like the motto
[1:30:08] <Dragon_Batman> That and not only using Cure on Barret
[1:30:11] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus there were a bunch of camera settings you didn't check out
[1:30:17] <+ekimthegib> Old bombing mission, 10-15 min. New Bombing mission, 45 min
[1:30:17] <MayorRev> New LP? PogChamp
[1:30:24] <zayasu> @dbhaze83 finishing
[1:30:26] <%Ipsenscastle> Midgar was the only really great bit of 7 anyway, I hope it's roamable
[1:30:28] <gamefan6219> woolie's dreads look like wires connectec to hs head
[1:30:33] <+DreyfussFrost> And if you tried to fill it, you couldn't possibly include it all. You'd end up with FFX.
[1:30:34] <+dbhaze83> RIP

[1:30:42] <@Solidus_113> That's what they're doing. Each character has their own gimmick
[1:30:43] <%gatorafan> I dunno, Barret looked pretty white mage there Kappa
[1:30:45] <Aji__> @ipsenscastle sbfpYeyeye
[1:30:50] <%jiggy_snipe> healer Barret
[1:30:52] <+viredae> "You wanna love as Barret"
[1:30:55] <heartlesshealer> relegate Cloud to healer and play as Tifa
[1:31:02] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Hey, Midgar used to be super empty and linear too......the overworld, if it actually is going to exist, is probably NOT going to be just like six towns
[1:31:03] <%DatAsuna> It's still not an action game
[1:31:10] <+BionoidLCR> Vincents gona be awesome
[1:31:10] <%fingalights> Cait Sith
[1:31:11] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Kinda curious how Aerith will play
[1:31:15] <dundore77> You wanna take Barret on the date over aerith
[1:31:15] <Wild_Samurai> Give me Cait Sith or give me death
[1:31:16] <AdmiralButtloaf> Cid's a Dragoon
[1:31:19] <%fingalights> Sait Sith will be dumb
[1:31:20] <+ekimthegib> I want to play sephiroth in the sequel
[1:31:21] <Solidnick18> PogChamp
[1:31:22] <%jiggy_snipe> what is Caith Sith gonna be like? PogChamp
[1:31:22] <OldManDeckardCain> tifa has actual combos apparently LUL
[1:31:24] <%SomersaultJustice> SHE BETTER DO IT
[1:31:25] <xxterminatorviixx> I’m ready for Red XIII
[1:31:25] <+NotHereToStream> tifa is gonna be sick
[1:31:27] <rheviel> Cait Sith tho
[1:31:30] <hntronium> DOLPHIN PUNCH
[1:31:31] <%gatorafan> Melee Aerith run, let's go
[1:31:36] <+croxeye> Tifa doing wakeup DP's lol
[1:31:37] <Snakes_dk> suplex sephiroth
[1:31:37] <%linSP> Is cid still a wife beater
[1:31:39] <+nekodelic> making them action character is awesome, but approaching this as an action game is not a good idea
[1:31:41] <%RJay80> suplex everything
[1:31:51] <%Irridium> WOOLIE CLAPPED
[1:31:53] <zayasu> Kappa //
[1:31:54] <Wild_Samurai> Cait Sith was never a cat to me. Retcon bullshit. He’s a marshmallow man!!!!!
[1:31:56] <Laironx3> The overworlds usually "hide" the fact that these jrpgs are linear
[1:31:58] <+OmegaWeltall> Command grabs like King
[1:31:58] <%fingalights> @linSP one can only hope?
[1:31:59] <+ekimthegib> Aight, now time for round 2
[1:31:59] <hntronium> He clapped when he saw it
[1:32:01] <+griffball13> I need to see how hard cid beats his wife
[1:32:03] <+viredae> Cid's probably nerfed to emotionally abusive
[1:32:05] <%Ipsenscastle> Mihn is super right
[1:32:05] <%jiggy_snipe> no more AssFace
[1:32:07] <@Solidus_113> RIP Blaze420
[1:32:12] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> @gatorafan i think Aerith's normal attack actually shoots orbs out of her staff
[1:32:13] <MayorRev> RIP CLUMBO
[1:32:17] <OkamiDude15> @Valentinius_Anodyne there is an gameplay demostration of tifa and aerith on the playstation japan youtube channel. they show off the sector 8 reactor + airbuster fight and the aps/abzu fight
[1:32:17] <+DreyfussFrost> You can't name the entire party Zack any more.
[1:32:18] <%gatorafan> Rip CLOD

[1:33:36] <wookie5358> The star player of the Zanarkand Abes
[1:33:44] <%jiggy_snipe> they never even refer to it except for one npc
[1:33:44] <heartlesshealer> The price of voice acting
[1:33:47] <Xelhesia> same here
[1:33:50] <Dragon_Batman> I do that too
[1:33:51] <+theAncopro> I play as Link
[1:33:51] <neVan0> same
[1:33:52] <Prevot> there's no canon persona name tho
[1:33:53] <NiktenKing> HANK HILL
[1:33:53] <+nekodelic> same
[1:33:54] <@Solidus_113> AKIRA KURUSU
[1:33:55] <+DreyfussFrost> Yeah I do the same.
[1:33:57] <+viredae> Yup!
[1:34:02] <+ekimthegib> Is it pronounced Titus, or Titus
[1:34:02] <%fingalights> Only changed the name in OoT cause I didnt know
[1:34:03] <%Ipsenscastle> I hate when they don't have a default name, it makes me feel like I'm playing as a mannequin
[1:34:03] <StarlitStunner> Same
[1:34:04] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BUT MUH FANTASY
[1:34:08] <Dragon_Batman> Akira bois
[1:34:08] <+viredae> Excuse you, his name is Ren Amamiya
[1:34:08] <Belutima> @prevot look it up itmejpSMUG
[1:34:09] <%CheekiBreeki27> Ren Amamiya
[1:34:13] <MayorRev> P5, main dude's named Ren yea?
[1:34:14] <+BurkeBigsby> Dick butt is an everlasting hero in my house.
[1:34:15] <%jiggy_snipe> silent protagis fine if it's still a character
[1:34:22] <+prime_name> Even a silent protagonist can have a personality. Like Byleth
[1:34:22] <+nekodelic> @prevot there is after they adapt the game to other media
[1:34:24] <@Solidus_113> MINATO ARISTATO
[1:34:28] <+viredae> Game's name is different than Anime for some reason
[1:34:28] <wookie5358> It's pronounced Aerith or Aeris
[1:34:29] <rubbishbinge> Yu Narukami or Seta Souji
[1:34:29] <Prevot> pretty sure there's a bunch of different names for Joker
[1:34:30] <%Exiliator> I name my character their real names, but I dont releate to Woolie's feeling of disconnection
[1:34:30] <Dragon_Batman> Minato bois
[1:34:33] <Nested_Dreams> But Doom Slayer is a silent protag tho
[1:34:33] <jonasislike> makoto yuki
[1:34:39] <MAX116030> Woolie : I'm not a fan of silent protagonist. Doom slayer enters the chat
[1:34:39] <%gatorafan> Lucky Ted
[1:34:39] <Wild_Samurai> Pokemon your name is RED damn it!!!
[1:34:41] <dmysta3000> That's why I couldnt really get into DQXI
[1:34:51] <Solidnick18> Link is zelda Kappa
[1:34:56] <powerprotoman> woolie hates creativity
[1:34:57] <jonasislike> Minato arisato sounds dumb
[1:35:00] <%Razputin217> Kenpachi Ramasama
[1:35:02] <+viredae> But Amamiya is cooler thanKurusu
[1:35:02] <Laycas49> Got some samurai hair happening
[1:35:02] <+griffball13> Same
[1:35:03] <NoireRequiem> makes no sense now
[1:35:03] <Xelhesia> Ludger Kresnik thankfully had a character despite being silent
[1:35:05] <Snakes_dk> LUL
[1:35:06] <Aji__> One of the worst silent protagonists is chrono, and CT is all text!
[1:35:08] <%fingalights> Brad was cool

[1:35:15] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 35 minutes
[1:35:21] <+nekodelic> naming characters is for failed character designers
[1:35:24] <%Exiliator> Okay Party Members are different tho
[1:35:24] <rubbishbinge> May as well name him Chicken Heart
[1:35:26] <%linSP> I wish chrono wasnt silent
[1:35:27] <%jiggy_snipe> Kenpachi Ramasama Kappa
[1:35:29] <MattoBii> Makoto Yuuki if you're nasty
[1:35:34] <rheviel> Brad that schmuck
[1:35:36] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Very Cool

[1:35:37] <MayorRev> REDBULL13
[1:35:38] <Acecorleone> I did
[1:35:42] <Wild_Samurai> Woolie gets Suicidal when he boots up DREAMS

[1:35:46] <%fingalights> ye
[1:35:47] <Xelhesia> Arisato Minato all the way
[1:35:51] <%gatorafan> I name all my characters gato daedra1DerpyTibs

[1:35:54] <+BurkeBigsby> Redoh Saaaarteen! in Japanese
[1:35:59] <%jiggy_snipe> Crono and Serge are fine silent protags
[1:36:01] <+ekimthegib> I was always lame and named the characters after me when I was younger.
[1:36:03] <+DreyfussFrost> Character creation is great when the game is designed for it, but go FULL custom or nothing. You design a character, you name it.
[1:36:16] <+viredae> Naming Frog as Glenn worked cause it felt like everyone was going "Wait, THAT Glenn?"
[1:36:17] <+theAncopro> what about the mass effect thing where they just go by last name
[1:36:22] <%jinking79> can't wait for Thursday
[1:36:25] <wookie5358> Oh.. The star player of the Zanarkand Abes.. I love you...
[1:36:28] <+ziggityzaq> I wish I could name cloud Zack in this
[1:36:32] <Wild_Samurai> FF7 better end with “Nanaki will return.....”
[1:36:32] <+ziggityzaq> Cloud
[1:36:45] <Prevot> ano hito
[1:36:47] <+kyh9> Best way to handle it is to have a nickname
[1:36:48] <heartlesshealer> "Him...?!"
[1:36:50] <%gatorafan> oh, it's you!
[1:36:52] <+kyh9> Three Strikes
[1:36:52] <Snakes_dk> PogChamp that guy killed him
[1:36:57] <rubbishbinge> I think you can still mess with names in Tales of
[1:36:57] <rheviel> the adventures of Slurmp our hero
[1:37:05] <+primax104> Mass Effect has Shepherd as well
[1:37:08] <ALTRNico> Yeah Fable II is really good
[1:37:09] <+nekodelic> who's the most important person in your life? - lucky ted
[1:37:10] <%linSP> Hey it’s that dog
[1:37:11] <+viredae> There's also Mass Effect's "Shepherd"
[1:37:13] <+Proxzo> Shepherd
[1:37:14] <MAX116030> Shepard
[1:37:14] <+BurkeBigsby> Chicken Chaser 4 lyfe.
[1:37:16] <Wild_Samurai> Do u remember “that day”?
[1:37:16] <%RJay80> chicken chaser hello
[1:37:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> RAGE OF AFRICA
[1:37:25] <NiktenKing> Joker
[1:37:26] <heartlesshealer> the nickname technique is nice
[1:37:26] <%RioGascar> I mean they solved that easy
[1:37:26] <Solidnick18> that's good
[1:37:28] <Dragon_Batman> That's Chicken Chaser I beliiieeeve
[1:37:28] <Ultimatefool> Welcome, Mr. Rage
[1:37:29] <%RioGascar> Alt names
[1:37:32] <+JacknZack27> Looking cool Joker

[1:37:39] <+huggablemantooth> easy
[1:37:44] <%BioHunter> exile
[1:37:50] <rheviel> do you chase chickens?!
[1:37:51] <Laironx3> Or give the custom character a last name
[1:37:55] <+viredae> the banter was pretty sweet
[1:38:01] <Snakes_dk> true
[1:38:04] <hntronium> Chicken?
[1:38:08] <hntronium> Chicken Arise
[1:38:13] <MAX116030> not really
[1:38:15] <Wild_Samurai> What’s bullshit is you can rename the Phantom Thieves in Persona then they STILL call you the Phantom Thieves
[1:38:15] <neVan0> hmmmmm
[1:38:18] <dmysta3000> XV had some great party banter
[1:38:19] <+DreyfussFrost> Good writing is a miracle for Square.
[1:38:20] <MattoBii> XV's big strength was the banter
[1:38:20] <@Solidus_113> this is the new norm
[1:38:22] <BaslerJones> thought he said merde for a minute
[1:38:24] <%gatorafan> the boyband was cool
[1:38:25] <rubbishbinge> Yeah, Cloud telling Barret to use Thunder was good
[1:38:27] <AMaidIndeed> bullshit, it was still weird
[1:38:27] <wookie5358> Time to ride the chocobo!
[1:38:29] <Dragon_Batman> Square has had some wonky dialogue, 15 had good stuff but it wasn't all good
[1:38:30] <%RioGascar> Because roleplaying woolie
[1:38:32] <Xelhesia> also every tales of game has done that for decades now
[1:38:33] <+DreyfussFrost> WHAT?! 15?!
[1:38:34] <MAX116030> Do we need to remind that DAMN cave section in 15?
[1:38:40] <ALTRNico> outside of squeenix
[1:38:43] <Nested_Dreams> Fallout 4 tried to voice lines for common names but being called "Fuckface" feels unreal
[1:38:51] <+BurkeBigsby> I wonder if the dialogue sounds more quintessentially anime in Japanese.
[1:38:52] <MattoBii> awkward pauses galore
[1:38:55] <Dragon_Batman> It's even in here
[1:38:59] <%BallerSwagBro9k> MMM
[1:39:00] <%gatorafan> Astral Chain is painful with that
[1:39:03] <%FenixSeraph> Solid Snake HNNRGH

[1:39:08] <lyzejag> hrnnngggg
[1:39:12] <Dragon_Batman> Character noises
[1:39:15] <%gunsrlove> kkkkhhhhhhh
[1:39:15] <Laironx3> GASP
[1:39:18] <dundore77> solid snake pronounces ... as hrnngg
[1:39:20] <+stef5949> "For real?"
[1:39:20] <rubbishbinge> んんんん
[1:39:22] <%gatorafan> it's like they didn't even bother to record more than 3 grunts
[1:39:23] <%FenixSeraph> HRRNGH KORONERU
[1:39:30] <Prevot> why would you play monster hunter without monhun language option
[1:39:30] <ralphfromdk> Pat tested what npc's will say when you take damage out of combat by stepping into lasers, and the thirsty girl had like 20 different lines about how you're dumb for hitting the laser.
[1:39:38] <%FuqBoiSlim> this is why I put MHW into Monster Hunter language the minute I bought it
[1:39:38] <Wild_Samurai> A weapon to surpass Metal Gear
[1:39:38] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:39:40] <Rixstarian> Nier Automata banter was good, there just isn't enough of it
[1:39:41] <+Quarkee> 14 has some great stuff
[1:39:41] <rheviel> the Japanese body language along with the vocal expressions
[1:39:42] <+viredae> XIV started more awkward, but got better after time
[1:39:45] <+DreyfussFrost> YES
[1:39:47] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> XIV also switches VA's like hot cakes
[1:39:47] <Xelhesia> FF14 is that standard now actually
[1:39:55] <+aqua_mashu> its really good now
[1:39:57] <%Ipsenscastle> Uncharted style
[1:39:57] <Wild_Samurai> 14 had voices? Lol
[1:40:01] <Talinu> 14 ARR has bad English voice acting but it got better after that.
[1:40:07] <Ultimatefool> 14 was weird at first but it's been spectacular since the first expansion
[1:40:08] <Dragon_Batman> The dialogue also counts toward the player too
[1:40:09] <Rixstarian> @wild_samurai Bruh
[1:40:09] <+DreyfussFrost> FF14 is fantastic. ARR was rough but it's Square's best now.
[1:40:11] <%BioHunter> 14 improved greatly after arr
[1:40:13] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> @Wild_Samurai ya
[1:40:14] <+Quarkee> with 14 they also get to call your character " warrior of light "
[1:40:16] <OkamiDude15> from what ive seen in newer 14 stuff ala shadowbringer its gotten better
[1:40:16] <+Ghost_Makuzaki> ff14 was an MMO too so dialog is hard to make seem natural
[1:40:17] <dmysta3000> I think the only othe SE example is Nier Automata
[1:40:18] <zayasu> @ralphfromdk woolie did that too
[1:40:21] <MillaMoks> what? FF14 has talking during fights all the time
[1:40:21] <@Solidus_113> The longer that Scorpion fight takes the more tired and pissed Barret gets about it
[1:40:32] <+Mkingston> Have i missed the demo gameplay?
[1:40:33] <NocturnalScotsman> I will say no mater if its bad or good Fallout 4 had i system that had tons of preset names to use if your name matches one of the one on the list, if its not on the list it defalts to wanderer or something
[1:40:38] <%jiggy_snipe> yea he starts to get annoyed by the laser
[1:40:39] <haisho> modern fantasy?
[1:40:40] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> @Mkingston just missed it
[1:40:41] <%FenixSeraph> I wish more RPGs would have pseudo-modern settings that aren't just literally Tokyo or some other real city
[1:40:43] <ralphfromdk> zayasu Guess i shouldn't have been late :p
[1:40:43] <+DreyfussFrost> 14 is now Square's best work. Minh quit while it was still starting out and rough.
[1:40:46] <+kyh9> Urban Fantasy
[1:40:46] <%FenixSeraph> @WoolieVersus it's called Urban Fantasy
[1:40:47] <@Solidus_113> Don't get it twisted, FF7 is dieselpunk not steampunk @WoolieVersus
[1:40:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> MODERN DAAAAY?
[1:40:49] <dmysta3000> Low Fantasy is the term
[1:40:50] <Laironx3> FF8 had that too 🤓
[1:40:50] <OkamiDude15> a fantasy set in reality evo19MindBlown
[1:40:52] <rubbishbinge> a fantasy based on reality
[1:40:52] <+kyh9> URBAN fantasy
[1:40:53] <+Mkingston> @TonyPullMyDTRedgrave damn. thanks.
[1:40:55] <dundore77> i mean 10 also had good banter depending on who beat what fiend and stuff
[1:40:57] <wookie5358> Steamy fantasy
[1:41:01] <Dragon_Batman> Yea while this is steam punky FAntasy
[1:41:02] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> @Mkingston np my guy o/
[1:41:03] <zayasu> @Mkingston yes
[1:41:04] <+kyh9> Urban Fantasy
[1:41:05] <heartlesshealer> Not sure you can count Nier for squeenix since they had Yoko Taro on that one
[1:41:07] <%FenixSeraph> the Xenoblade games have pretty good banter IMO
[1:41:13] <%Ipsenscastle> Dieselpunk
[1:41:13] <%jinking79> was it ff 11 or 14 where they destroy the game then bought it back?
[1:41:16] <%Ipsenscastle> Magipunk
[1:41:18] <heartlesshealer> they just kinda funded his story
[1:41:23] <OkamiDude15> 14
[1:41:23] <akman14> It's called Urban Fantasy
[1:41:24] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> @FenixSeraph "It's Rein Time"
[1:41:27] <+viredae> FF14
[1:41:28] <haisho> if the end of the world happened right now, would its genre be...FINAL Fantasy?
[1:41:28] <%RioGascar> also minh they do speak in battle in 14
[1:41:30] <Wild_Samurai> Is that a Mike Mignola Batman statue back there?
[1:41:33] <rheviel> Realistic Fantasy
[1:41:35] <+Nobrev> @dreyfussfrost Minh also wanted to play in his weird way that the game isnt built for
[1:41:36] <OkamiDude15> 14 started out bad so they nuked it and started over
[1:41:37] <+nekodelic> xenoblade chronicles 2 has terrible banter
[1:41:44] <%RioGascar> Limited battle banter but 14 has it
[1:41:57] <OkamiDude15> xenoblade chronicles 1 is alright
[1:41:57] <+viredae> I loved that Cloud slightly shows what a dork he was, I breathed a sigh of relief
[1:42:07] <Dragon_Batman> It's nice that every scene they are hiding and your just there
[1:42:08] <Xelhesia> xenoblade 2 has some serious issues overall
[1:42:11] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> @RioGascar 14 also does have fully voiced cutscenes... like not every CS but a bunch do for the major story beats.
[1:42:12] <%Exiliator> Exiliator subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 4 month streak! Wuddup up Woolie, Minh, and Feetlover69! Loving the current content, keep up the great work!
[1:42:31] <+Nobrev> XC1 is best, XC2 is second best, XC2 is fine
[1:42:32] <Belutima> Def DieselPunk since it's all based on burning fossil fuels, ala Mako energy.
[1:42:35] <Wild_Samurai> Everyone keeps saying “I love Cloud is a dork again”. Then the demo has him Emo as fuck lol
[1:42:51] <+Nobrev> XCX is 2nd *. autocorrect a fuck
[1:42:54] <+captain_history> He isn't emo at all. At least not AC emo.
[1:42:55] <NoireRequiem> nO QUALMS
[1:42:56] <+viredae> there were a few lines where he totally gives it away
[1:43:00] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> @Wild_Samurai what are you talking about? he's not emo in this demo LUL
[1:43:06] <@Solidus_113> Worry about the references to Dirge Of Cerberus
[1:43:07] <%RioGascar> The limited time I played ff7 i treated it like yeah i dont care about the planet
[1:43:08] <Prevot> XCX has the best gameplay by far
[1:43:09] <Belutima> @wild_samurai tells me how you don't know what emo means LUL
[1:43:09] <%RioGascar> Fuck you pay me
[1:43:10] <%jiggy_snipe> he's no emo, he's just an ass
[1:43:11] <wookie5358> Cloud's not emo in the demo at all to me
[1:43:13] <ralphfromdk> Wild_Samurai yea, I got 5% dork, 95 unlikeable grumpy asshat
[1:43:18] <+prime_name> Sephie is already wildly known. Why hide it?
[1:43:21] <fruit_pie_the_magician> He's trying to be cool by acting slightly emo
[1:43:21] <wookie5358> He's a scrub who's full of himself
[1:43:24] <Laironx3> Sloppy Sephirot
[1:43:24] <heartlesshealer> he's closer to tryhard, which still makes him a dork
[1:43:29] <vonmaultke> The back down from Terrorism. They killed so many people now they only look like they did.
[1:43:30] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Cloud's just kinda aloof, not emo at all
[1:43:31] <+McSoliace> @Wild_Samurai he's trying to be an edgelord but on the inside he's a dork
[1:43:34] <%RioGascar> i dont like the idea of “interruptions WASTE you ATB”
[1:43:35] <Aji__> Max’s stream last night had a bit of that spoilery stuff
[1:43:37] <Wild_Samurai> He’s certainly not Tidus. People act like they radically departed from Advent Children Cloud
[1:43:39] <Wild_Samurai> Not yet
[1:43:40] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> Cloud's just a grumpy dorkus in this demo which is the best LUL
[1:43:45] <%jiggy_snipe> Max spoiled alot last night
[1:43:48] <NoireRequiem> I think the there's sephiwad teasing done right, he's baiting all the way through
[1:43:49] <rubbishbinge> he's a solider 1st class BibleThump
[1:43:51] <%StaceMcGate> Heyo, how was the Jessie thirst demo
[1:43:52] <dundore77> Cloud is a dork that acts like a cocky soldier 1st class... kind of makes sense
[1:43:53] <+Mkingston> Are the crew going to watch Cloud and Tifa fuck?
[1:43:55] <+captain_history> They even go beyond OG on how a dork he is now.
[1:43:58] <%jiggy_snipe> chapter 2 is pretty good from what he said
[1:44:03] <+CatsEyeBlind> I can't wait for the PTSD montages
[1:44:12] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> dude the PTSD montages are gonna be so good
[1:44:12] <%RioGascar> like seriously interrupting your actions is hars enough but ALSO DRAINING your meter?
[1:44:17] <wookie5358> Max was spoiling the hell out of some of those parts lol
[1:44:19] <+viredae> the voice is probably going to be Sephie voice
[1:44:20] <dmysta3000> Based on what Max mentioned on his stream last night, I'm looking forwards to the Sephiroth hallucinations
[1:44:20] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> I can't wait enigmaGasm
[1:44:22] <ralphfromdk> so Cloud is comic DeadPool then? :o
[1:44:23] <+griffball13> i wonder if he will beat arith
[1:44:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ORAORAORAORA Aerith
[1:44:27] <%linSP> So the ending is happy and feel good right
[1:44:27] <@Solidus_113> don't get hit
[1:44:27] <+nekodelic> @nobrev strictly on battle banter, XC2 is terrible (though I will never forget you, Ardanian soldiers, no matter how many times they patch your lines)
[1:44:27] <neVan0> the voice is gonna be where they insert gackt!
[1:44:34] <OkamiDude15> @ralphfromdk no
[1:44:35] <%RioGascar> 300 hrs is overkill
[1:44:40] <Wild_Samurai> Max has been the worst lately. Also too abusive to chat. Unsubscribe lol
[1:44:41] <%gatorafan> I can't wait for Cloud to bear up Aerith! Kappa
[1:44:50] <%gatorafan> dammit phone
[1:44:50] <Jaxnos> getting interrupted is the same as missing it's eeeeeeeeez
[1:44:55] <+Mkingston> I finished the original for the first time on Sunday.
[1:45:01] <dundore77> give a 10 minute unskippable gackt video
[1:45:01] <+Nobrev> @vonmaultke even in the original jessie remarks that her bomb shouldn't have been strong enough to blow the whole reactor like that. FF7R just makes it more overt that shines blew it to make AVALANCHE look like the bad guys
[1:45:12] <Aji__> @linsp of entire ff7? Yeah but its a bit in the air up for interpretation. But since Advent children has sort of rewritten it
[1:45:12] <wookie5358> I don't blame Max; he's excited, and I'm too excited to leave
[1:45:12] <+McSoliace> @Wild_Samurai doodStare
[1:45:44] <fruit_pie_the_magician> On the plus side, when Cloud DOES beat Aeris' ass, it will be way more apparent that he's completely out of his mind
[1:45:47] <Fujiwara_92> No Gackt = Refund
[1:45:49] <rheviel> looking at 200 hour P5 save....300 hours can be done easy.
[1:45:49] <+heartbbyy> what did max do
[1:45:56] <%RioGascar> I equate his excitement to my half life alyx excitement
[1:45:57] <+thackattack00> nothing
[1:45:57] <Aydarkzero> look at the ProZD skit about anime villains Kappa
[1:45:58] <+Mkingston> The janky, poorly explained and hardly play tested mini-games will be fixed.
[1:46:03] <Wild_Samurai> Max creates all this drama about SF5 online. Plays a single day of the patch, is flawless for him, then never touches again...
[1:46:04] <+McSoliace> he gave warnings right before he spoiled things
[1:46:10] <wookie5358> Max did nothing; he's just very very passionate about the game and likes talking about everything he's seen
[1:46:15] <%fingalights> @Fujiwara_92 If enough people keep this meme alive, Square will probably do it
[1:46:23] <vonmaultke> @Nobrev yea but it takes the moral grey from the story. That both sides will kill rando's for their cause.The real decider will be Cid (thats all i'll say for spoils)
[1:46:26] <Solidnick18> alright
[1:46:27] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @vVAstrAVv
[1:46:33] <+viredae> Reggie's just "Yup!"
[1:46:34] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> @wild_samurai the mans allowed to di what he wants. chill lol
[1:46:35] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Lets goooooooooo
[1:46:37] <dmysta3000> That was one thing I liked about Crisis Core, seeing Sephiroth back when he was a cool guy was interesting
[1:46:51] <Solidnick18> lol
[1:46:51] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1234692167358177282?s=19

[1:47:35] <Solidnick18> i saw it
[1:47:36] <ralphfromdk> So, what we playing for the actually game today?
[1:47:54] <%RioGascar> Thats not how others work woolie
[1:47:54] <@Solidus_113> unknown
[1:47:55] <OkamiDude15> you can also see the stubble on cloud and sephiroth's faces
[1:47:55] <rubbishbinge> 100 gb ;-;
[1:47:57] <+Ghost_Makuzaki> what gets me is the lip sync
[1:48:00] <heartlesshealer> cloth stitching
[1:48:07] <DarknessD42> Tifa has moles Kreygasm
[1:48:08] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Cowards
[1:48:09] <+griffball13> COWARDS
[1:48:09] <%CheekiBreeki27> There are scratches on Tifa's wristguards
[1:48:10] <%RioGascar> Is 15 fully voiced?
[1:48:13] <Snakes_dk> unleash theme
[1:48:15] <itesket> Not pointy
[1:48:16] <Solidnick18> get bigger
[1:48:17] <+Mkingston> It makes me excited to see what the final part will be like on the PS5.
[1:48:17] <+viredae> but then people saw Tifa's tits
[1:48:18] <rubbishbinge> That puddle is too non existant
[1:48:20] <wookie5358> That whole controversy is BS imo
[1:48:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> MUH TIDDIES THO
[1:48:22] <ImmaCanuck> It's called a sports bra.
[1:48:22] <%RJay80> Tit Gate
[1:48:23] <heartlesshealer> her tits are fine
[1:48:24] <Xelhesia> the tits will be modded on PC no worries
[1:48:26] <Laironx3> Authentic cowards
[1:48:26] <Fujiwara_92> Theyre fine
[1:48:27] <muniea3> too many polygons
[1:48:27] <%FuqBoiSlim> dont put it all on the jpn fans that was Americans too
[1:48:29] <@Solidus_113> Tifa's boobs were smaller (but not actually she had a sports bra)
[1:48:31] <NoireRequiem> PUDDLE GATE
[1:48:33] <HideousDeity> There was a controversy of Barret not being black enough.
[1:48:34] <+kyh9> Ethics department
[1:48:34] <rheviel> cowards
[1:48:36] <+aqua_mashu> big honkers
[1:48:38] <OkamiDude15> @RioGascar iirc yeah
[1:48:38] <wookie5358> They said they will "restrict" the size
[1:48:38] <+theAncopro> sports bra limiter
[1:48:39] <heartlesshealer> we were all just worried that she was left out of the trailer because of her tits
[1:48:39] <fruit_pie_the_magician> They used to be like 50 percent of her body weight in the original
[1:48:42] <rubbishbinge> whens narmaya huehuehuehue
[1:48:44] <Aji__> Triple J cup Tifa PC Mod on release
[1:48:45] <+heartbbyy> her core values are the right size
[1:48:46] <+Ahegaliant> It'll be moddable on pc anyway
[1:48:46] <%Ipsenscastle> where are her VAGINA BONES
[1:48:47] <Prevot> they're good enough, but should be even bigger
[1:48:47] <+nekodelic> puddle gate LUL
[1:48:52] <+Godjaw> I want Tifa's angular tits, I wanna cut diamonds on them things
[1:48:52] <%Exiliator> Her tits are fine, but bigger is better Kappa
[1:48:53] <wookie5358> But look at her in that dress at Corneo's mansion. That is not nerfed.
[1:48:54] <NeetKiller> Cloud has AC Cloud hair
[1:48:57] <dmysta3000> I love how SE actually put out Cosplay refernece guides for the characters in XV
[1:48:59] <OBS_VinnieK> The Tifa tiddy thing = so many people remember the Tifa hentai that they forgot how big her actual breast size is.
[1:48:59] <NocturnalScotsman> Aerith's dress has tons of embroidering on it it looks super detailed up close
[1:49:03] <%fingalights> Pointy boobs, or bust
[1:49:03] <Dragon_Batman> She is actually dressed more appropriate for fighting
[1:49:04] <+BurkeBigsby> Pointy hair must be perfect.
[1:49:06] <OBS_VinnieK> so people complained
[1:49:08] <bleugh> nyannUguu
[1:49:11] <+nintega010> i seriously thought when aris I thought they was talking about fgc aris not aerith
[1:49:11] <+theAncopro> the DOA age slider
[1:49:11] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> that was such a dumb thing to be upset over lmfao
[1:49:11] <+heartbbyy> ill mod her tits out
[1:49:12] <+ekimthegib> HERESY
[1:49:15] <zhu000> wow and yikes

[1:49:16] <OkamiDude15> breaking new : people dont know how bodies work
[1:49:19] <%RioGascar> its not the half life cinematic mod WHERE THEY “ FULLY” modeled Alyx Vance in half life 2
[1:49:20] <Fujiwara_92> LUL
[1:49:22] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[1:49:23] <ALTRNico> I just want Tifa to be toned. She looks really skinny rn
[1:49:23] <Prevot> LUL
[1:49:23] <dmysta3000> They just gave her a sports bra
[1:49:25] <Solidnick18> oh right
[1:49:26] <neVan0> LUL
[1:49:26] <sanictheblur> Hey peeps
[1:49:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> OH NOOOOOOOOOO
[1:49:27] <%Exiliator> LUL
[1:49:28] <%FenixSeraph> Tifa's boobs are still huge it's just that the rest of her body has realistic proportions so she's not a cartoon stick and balloon woman
[1:49:29] <Wild_Samurai> Developer “stop being so thirsty creepy fucks....um translate that more kindly plz”
[1:49:31] <Laironx3> monkaS
[1:49:32] <Xelhesia> lol

[1:49:39] <ImmaCanuck> What even is this convo
[1:49:40] <NoireRequiem> Woolie why do YOU gotta bring up old shit
[1:49:40] <Nested_Dreams> "There will be adjustments to the breasts netcode"
[1:49:41] <trueherobappo> I saw that Reggie LUL
[1:49:44] <@Solidus_113> you're like 2 hours late @Horosho
[1:49:44] <heartlesshealer> You should provide context before giving us these sound clips
[1:49:45] <Dragon_Batman> Tifa has abs and musculatuer
[1:49:48] <%fingalights> I wish Tifa was more buff
[1:49:48] <+Nobrev> @horosho just finished it
[1:49:49] <%Ipsenscastle> What was the moment you knew you'd lost creative control of the podcast?
[1:49:49] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Horosho Just finished it
[1:49:50] <+Horosho> OOF
[1:49:55] <+nekodelic> TTPO
[1:49:58] <+Horosho> perfect timing
[1:49:59] <%StaceMcGate> I came back to talking about 99 year old breast physics
[1:50:00] <+MrRabbles> Musclegate
[1:50:02] <%DatAsuna> That's a weird way to say misconception
[1:50:04] <NoireRequiem> Woolie likes age UP
[1:50:04] <+ekimthegib> Square would never make Tifa's punching bags smaller
[1:50:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I was born 93
[1:50:11] <%StaceMcGate> I was born in 1988 you zoomers
[1:50:12] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> atpCap atpFeelsBeardMan
[1:50:12] <+Andrizzleton> KH is trash
[1:50:16] <Quietshun13> just play kh2
[1:50:16] <+thackattack00> lol
[1:50:17] <+Mkingston> The detail of the clothes wrapped around Cloud and Barrett's arms to stop the metal hurting them was a clever addition.
[1:50:18] <zhu000> nah
[1:50:19] <muniea3> stop being so young on my lawn
[1:50:21] <+heartbbyy> anyone who just wished tifa was more buff has good taste
[1:50:25] <TheRealSk1ll3s> KH story is trash, gameplay is good
[1:50:26] <VJdarkworld> delay based boobies WutFace
[1:50:33] <Quietshun13> kh2 is amazing
[1:50:36] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Jesus christ I've been asking for a remake or something since before you assholes were conceived
[1:50:37] <wookie5358> Rollback boobies?
[1:50:38] <OkamiDude15> kh is trash but its my trash and i love it
[1:50:39] <+Andrizzleton> @TheRealSk1ll3s i respect that
[1:50:43] <%fingalights> Tifa needs to be 7' 2" with massive muscles
[1:50:49] <%gatorafan> I reject your Canon woolieMIRIN
[1:50:58] <+Nobrev> @okamidude15 mood
[1:51:00] <VJdarkworld> @wookie5358 Rollback boobies PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[1:51:03] <yeildingthought> Nah, kingdom heart’s can remain where it is, lost in it’s re re releases LUL
[1:51:05] <%StaceMcGate> Tifa needs to be Noi from Dorehedoro
[1:51:13] <rubbishbinge> Tifa needs an Advent Children costume
[1:51:17] <%DatAsuna> You can't cater to everyone's headcanon's simultaneously.
[1:51:18] <dmysta3000> Too many fucking Marvel characters aplly to this
[1:51:21] <Xelhesia> Noi is best giel 100%
[1:51:23] <ralphfromdk> Mkingston That's basicly how real amputation works. You don't just stick your stump into the fake limb, you coushin that thing first.
[1:51:29] <+BionoidLCR> @Xelhesia Damn straight
[1:51:32] <@Solidus_113> time for a new coat of paint
[1:51:33] <%DatAsuna> And yeah there's never been a movie spider-man that's MY spider-ma
[1:51:40] <+Mkingston> @StaceMcGate I immediately like you for mentioning Dorohedoro. I'm on volume 18.
[1:51:40] <wookie5358> Just bring in people who loved the original and have them make the decisions on who Cloud is
[1:51:45] <+thackattack00> Noi Kreygasm
[1:51:51] <rheviel> Bara Tifa or riot
[1:51:51] <+ekimthegib> It'll always be Aeris in my head
[1:51:52] <NoireRequiem> I mean this is the futility of any adaptation
[1:51:57] <+Mkingston> @ralphfromdk exactly
[1:52:01] <Prevot> earth-chan
[1:52:01] <@Solidus_113> Dissidia
[1:52:03] <+BionoidLCR> @StaceMcGate noi is all that matters
[1:52:10] <%fingalights> kh2 cloud is just AC
[1:52:14] <+thackattack00> KH was my introduction to Cloud
[1:52:17] <Snakes_dk> did we want smash bros Cloud
[1:52:17] <NoireRequiem> People just need to temper expectations to what the devs state they are going after
[1:52:19] <%Exiliator> My Cloud > Your Cloud
[1:52:20] <uberdude47> and dissidia
[1:52:23] <Quietshun13> They already nailed cloud in the remake
[1:52:24] <Wild_Samurai> Vivi with a voice could be a big Fuck Up in the future. Do you give him a girl voice? A spooooky voice?
[1:52:24] <%jiggy_snipe> every Cloud post original FF7 is not CLoud's personality from 7 lol
[1:52:24] <SoaringLettuce> ive heard the goofiness from the original was the result of localization
[1:52:25] <Laironx3> I only played KH1, 2 and Chain Memories, those games are all about the "moments" than the overall plot for me.
[1:52:26] <+thackattack00> I thought he was the coolest shit I ever saw
[1:52:32] <+nintega010> i think they got cloud right
[1:52:34] <%fingalights> In the end, everyone needs to stop being wrong
[1:52:36] <%Ipsenscastle> @wookie5358 lots of fans are idiots though. Look at the hordes of people who were all in on AC because look big fights

[1:52:38] <Fujiwara_92> World of Final Fantasy Cloud Kappa

[1:52:47] <+BionoidLCR> @StaceMcGate VoteYea
[1:52:48] <%Ipsenscastle> The Rogue One problem
[1:52:53] <rubbishbinge> KH One Winged Cloud is pretty OK
[1:52:53] <@Solidus_113> Theatrythm Cloud
[1:52:54] <NoireRequiem> Not World War Hulk
[1:52:57] <+captain_history> They literally said they went with emo Cloud in AC and beyond because they thought that was more popular.
[1:52:58] <+viredae> FF Brave Exvius Cloud Kappa
[1:53:04] <+DreyfussFrost> @therealsk1ll3s I REALLY hope not.
[1:53:06] <Snakes_dk> Theatrerhythm Cloud was pretty authetic Kappa
[1:53:09] <heartlesshealer> Have fun finishing up the series, @Mkingston! And if you still hunger for Q Hayashida work afterwards, there's some Dai Dark out there
[1:53:09] <NeetKiller> KH1 Cloud was supposed to be Vincent
[1:53:11] <wookie5358> AC isn't the original, though. Most people who know the original are quite okay with the Cloud we got @Ipsenscastle
[1:53:13] <%StaceMcGate> Kingdom Hearts 1 Cloud LUL
[1:53:22] <+viredae> Opera Omnia's Cloud is best Kappa

[1:54:07] <%jiggy_snipe> he's 21
[1:54:11] <Edajos> cloud was always a dorky twink
[1:54:12] <TheRealSk1ll3s> 21 but looks like 17 max
[1:54:13] <Talinu> He was more bishi in AC
[1:54:15] <jonasislike> He’s 21 minh
[1:54:15] <Xelhesia> thats every FF protagonist tho
[1:54:15] <OkamiDude15> cloud is a bishi bishi breaky breaky
[1:54:19] <+Mkingston> @StaceMcGate Haru is bae for me
[1:54:23] <Fujiwara_92> Bishi bishi Cloud
[1:54:23] <itesket> Cloud's core is bishi
[1:54:23] <dmysta3000> Cloud has ALWAYS been bishe, we're just seeing it with modern technology
[1:54:25] <%DatAsuna> This is exhibit A right here
[1:54:28] <RottenK> Am i gay if i want to kiss Cloud
[1:54:29] <haisho> reminder that the Chibi Cloud song exists
[1:54:30] <rubbishbinge> Jim Lee's Cloud is cool
[1:54:31] <+ekimthegib> He looked pretty badass in the Battle screen
[1:54:31] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[1:54:32] <%Exiliator> Might be because youre older as well
[1:54:35] <+solzan2000> seems ok here
[1:54:35] <itesket> Aka bishi
[1:54:38] <black_pariah> he was never cool
[1:54:40] <%jiggy_snipe> you can't be cool and bishi got it?

[1:54:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> KPOP CLoud
[1:54:46] <jonasislike> He’s super young in his og 97 artwork
[1:54:47] <+captain_history> Cloud is bishi enought to be able to fool Corneo, think about it.
[1:54:47] <%StaceMcGate> Important news, there is a mod that puts Ada in RE2R into Tifa's outfit
[1:54:50] <SuperKirby24> is this pre- demo playthrough or post?
[1:54:52] <Snakes_dk> all ff characters are very bishi
[1:54:52] <+nekodelic> @rottenk yes, but that's fine
[1:54:54] <OkamiDude15> @RottenK your slightly bi at best
[1:54:54] <ALTRNico> I was paying attention to Tifa during Advent Children
[1:54:55] <%Ipsenscastle> Cloud looks like male Lightning now, it's come full-circle
[1:54:57] <+Mkingston> Japanese love effeminate men
[1:54:58] <@Solidus_113> Chuuni Cloud?
[1:54:58] <dmysta3000> He kinda has to for the crossdressing scene to work
[1:55:02] <Wild_Samurai> Cloud was always a Lego character. Prove me wrong
[1:55:04] <Fujiwara_92> GACKT CLOUD
[1:55:06] <rheviel> "I didn't pay attention" - Minh
[1:55:06] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Woolie interested in chats reaction LUL
[1:55:08] <+DreyfussFrost> Woolie, do you remember the original FF7 portrait art?
[1:55:09] <Dragon_Batman> He is that age so that works
[1:55:10] <powerprotoman> he looks under cooked
[1:55:11] <%Exiliator> When you reach late thirties suddently everyone below 25 looks like a child apparently
[1:55:12] <neVan0> AS HE SHOULD??
[1:55:13] <%fingalights> All ff7 characters are hot and ready singles in your area
[1:55:18] <xxterminatorviixx> Cloud looks more feminine
[1:55:18] <+DreyfussFrost> Fuck the AC version.
[1:55:19] <frostech8> He's a young adult
[1:55:23] <jonasislike> THATS HIS AGE LUL
[1:55:28] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LETS MOSEY
[1:55:31] <rubbishbinge> I always thought he was pretty bulky
[1:55:35] <Snakes_dk> he needs to look bishi for the honey bee inn scenes
[1:55:42] <+ekimthegib> I guess he had to be Passable in a dress so I guess he couldn't be too butch
[1:55:54] <Star_Duck> Yeah i allways saw Cloud as this as Well, and it's pretty close to Nomura's original vision
[1:55:57] <+ZeroXI> in AC he looks tired
[1:55:59] <%StaceMcGate> GACKT IS INEVITABLE
[1:56:01] <%gatorafan> Character Preset 1, but blonde
[1:56:01] <NocturnalScotsman> omg i just remembered the PSM magazine artist version of the FF7 cast
[1:56:05] <wookie5358> Cloud is a young kid
[1:56:10] <%CheekiBreeki27> He's always been pretty passable in the dress
[1:56:14] <%Exiliator> xactly
[1:56:14] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BooMihn
[1:56:17] <Fujiwara_92> Is Cloud a beta Kappa
[1:56:18] <ALTRNico> Dont let it set in Minh
[1:56:18] <+Mkingston> He is childish in the game.
[1:56:21] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> getting older NotLikeThis
[1:56:22] <%StaceMcGate> Cloud is only 5'7
[1:56:25] <%Ipsenscastle> There were illustrations to go by though, it's not like we didn't know what he looked like
[1:56:25] <@Solidus_113> Old man Minh
[1:56:34] <jonasislike> BOOMER MINH
[1:56:36] <neVan0> oh no
[1:56:37] <Xelhesia> when we played FF7 orignally they were older than most of us playing it
[1:56:37] <%linSP> sbfpSetIn
[1:56:38] <heartlesshealer> Woolie is aware of Clamp
[1:56:41] <OkamiDude15> i guess im cloud height nkoThink
[1:56:42] <rubbishbinge> Zack would be a tombstone
[1:56:43] <+mattie253> new lp?
[1:56:47] <neVan0> LUL
[1:56:47] <SoaringLettuce> do not speak of clamp
[1:56:47] <toomuchsnarf> doodNuts
[1:56:48] <+NotHereToStream> oh no
[1:56:49] <SuperKirby24> but real question tho: if ff7 is being remade, will the ff7 house be remade LUL
[1:56:51] <ralphfromdk> 20 year old are basicly children when you're 30+ yourself.... couple that with anime face and the get even younger looking, makes sense
[1:56:53] <%StaceMcGate> Woolie has been mentioning Clamp for years
[1:56:54] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:56:54] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Sephy
[1:56:55] <Wild_Samurai> Thin eyed? Easy there...
[1:56:57] <%Ipsenscastle> BISHI BISHI BREAKY BREAKY
[1:56:57] <%fingalights> Wide eyed bottom
[1:56:58] <dmysta3000> So basically Zack was Woolie's version of Cloud
[1:57:02] <Solidnick18> bishi bottom
[1:57:03] <Fujiwara_92> Sakura Card Captors brother LUL
[1:57:03] <@Solidus_113> Cloud is a power bottom
[1:57:04] <%FenixSeraph> Young Cloud topping experienced bottom Zack is way hotter though
[1:57:07] <+nekodelic> YEAH BOY
[1:57:09] <speximillian> How many pies will Woolie make Barett steal?
[1:57:10] <+BionoidLCR> breaky breaky
[1:57:11] <+Horosho> im glad i missed the gameplay for this convo
[1:57:12] <NoireRequiem> Woolie abort mission man
[1:57:12] <+captain_history> Sephiroth yeah, Zack was always kind of childish too.
[1:57:13] <zhu000> cloud never a chad
[1:57:14] <heartlesshealer> @StaceMcGate I wasn't here for any of those times apparently
[1:57:15] <haisho> as long as their hands aren't abnormally huge
[1:57:19] <%DatAsuna> CHAD STRIFE
[1:57:20] <OkamiDude15> woolie read that clamp jojo doujin and he was never the same
[1:57:20] <rubbishbinge> Zack too busying mackin' on Aqua
[1:57:20] <+nekodelic> Cloud is the brat bottom
[1:57:21] <Xelhesia> exactly
[1:57:24] <%fingalights> ye
[1:57:27] <%StaceMcGate> Cloud is confirmed bottom, see Honey Bee Inn
[1:57:27] <Solidnick18> monkaS
[1:57:27] <SoaringLettuce> THAT MAKES SENSE
[1:57:29] <%jiggy_snipe> yea 21 year olds are kids to me
[1:57:30] <ALTRNico> oh that makes sense
[1:57:34] <NoireRequiem> Now we are all Barret
[1:57:43] <OkamiDude15> create a cloud
[1:57:44] <jonasislike> it all makes sense now
[1:57:45] <zhu000> he aint solid snake sir
[1:57:48] <%fingalights> We're all Cid now
[1:57:54] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[1:58:00] <wookie5358> We believed Cloud when he tried to be cool while we were kids
[1:58:05] <%StaceMcGate> I'm almost Barret's age... I can hear the planet crying out to me
[1:58:07] <+Mkingston> I'm curious to see how the more bizarre and bigger enemies are handled in combat.
[1:58:08] <%gatorafan> yeah, like how you can no longer talk about taking part in Evangelion waifu wars.
[1:58:08] <+ekimthegib> I'm closer to Cid's age than to Clouds, feels bad
[1:58:09] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Hes Gackt's brother Kappa
[1:58:09] <%linSP> I only kne KH Cloud
[1:58:11] <zhu000> smells like gackt no likey
[1:58:12] <+MrRabbles> nah he's probably just a midboss type
[1:58:14] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Played this shit when I was like 11-12
[1:58:14] <+Andrizzleton> atpOld we cid now
[1:58:15] <%linSP> Knew*
[1:58:21] <rubbishbinge> What ever happened to the Before Crisis Turks
[1:58:23] <%fingalights> Isn't Cid only 30?
[1:58:24] <masterfire23> @kyh9 haven't seen you since the Etika stream days
[1:58:25] <%jiggy_snipe> I assume he will be a jobber
[1:58:27] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> well you fight Roche at least twice apparently since he says something along the lines of "wanting another dance" or something
[1:58:29] <Nested_Dreams> Hmm, but the Remake Cloud seems very very pragmatic, so I think the part of adultness still applies
[1:58:30] <%Ipsenscastle> They needed another SOLDIER to sell the setting in this version
[1:58:32] <heartlesshealer> Cloud probably just steals his motorbike
[1:58:32] <toomuchsnarf> Now fight your rival
[1:58:32] <+Andrizzleton> (cid was an old man at 35 yrs old)
[1:58:32] <+captain_history> I'm kind of expect for him to die in this game.
[1:58:35] <jonasislike> Motorcycle boy is clouds seifer
[1:58:35] <Snakes_dk> will vincent play like Dante?
[1:58:35] <ALTRNico> youu
[1:58:37] <Wild_Samurai> How many Race time trial side missions will there be??
[1:58:38] <+ekimthegib> @fingalights 32 I think
[1:58:39] <+DreyfussFrost> He exists to provide the perspective of current Shinra soldiers.
[1:58:44] <Dragon_Batman> It looks like you take his weapon in the last trailer
[1:58:48] <+viredae> recurring bossfight
[1:58:53] <%fingalights> @ekimthegib that's so silly
[1:58:53] <wookie5358> I have a theory in my mind that Roche will be connected to Zack
[1:58:54] <+ekimthegib> Barrett's 35
[1:58:55] <NoireRequiem> I hope they redeem vincent, goddamn Dirge
[1:58:56] <%StaceMcGate> Barret is 35, Cid is 32
[1:58:57] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> I mean, the script has to be different if you're planning to put 60 hours into what was originally a 4 hour tops section limesThink
[1:58:58] <%CheekiBreeki27> 32 in anime may as well be senile
[1:58:58] <OkamiDude15> he'll most be a recurring character throughout midgar but thats about it
[1:58:59] <%linSP> Cid looks like early 40’s
[1:59:02] <+Mkingston> I want to see how the Ultimate Weapon battles are handled.
[1:59:05] <yeildingthought> Inb4 rush is a boss before the revival of sephiroth PogChamp
[1:59:05] <%gatorafan> 32? You are practically a Corpse (nothing)

[2:01:23] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Callinte's Beautiful Bodie
[2:01:24] <%Irridium> LUL
[2:01:27] <Prevot> no skyrim allowed on this stream
[2:01:27] <rubbishbinge> Bras don't exist in Japanese jiggle physics
[2:01:27] <SoaringLettuce> wrong crowd
[2:01:31] <muniea3> "Caliente's Beautiful Bodies Edition"
[2:01:32] <%CheekiBreeki27> BREASTplate
[2:01:33] <+ekimthegib> I want the Jiggle to hit the face
[2:01:33] <trueherobappo> Skyrim
[2:01:36] <NiktenKing> When you see a screenshot without the mod name mentioned... you'll know
[2:01:44] <haisho> maybe she made it herself
[2:01:45] <rheviel> Realistic Fantasy
[2:01:45] <%Irridium> she had it made specifically like that because cloud was there
[2:01:48] <ALTRNico> but what if she's actually flat?
[2:01:49] <NoireRequiem> nip armour
[2:01:49] <%StaceMcGate> Mako Armor, doesn't have to make sense
[2:01:50] <toomuchsnarf> No it’s fine though
[2:01:51] <@Solidus_113> The tiddies need to be like balloons filled with pudding
[2:01:52] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Xelhesia
[2:01:53] <heartlesshealer> But sculpting for the exact shape is the most dangerous!
[2:01:54] <jonasislike> Big nonsense armor lol
[2:01:56] <rubbishbinge> Narmaya's boobies got those hitboxes tho
[2:01:57] <%SomersaultJustice> I for one need my chest armor to lift and separate
[2:02:02] <%gatorafan> just put traffic cones on it
[2:02:04] <SuperKirby24> never forget tiddies in granblue are a hitbox LUL
[2:02:05] <+theAncopro> ever see that dunfeons and dragons movie
[2:02:07] <Dragon_Batman> It'll hold better LUL
[2:02:08] <Laironx3> Maybe... the armor is just for show Kappa
[2:02:09] <+nekodelic> there were boob armours in history tho
[2:02:10] <NocturnalScotsman> no the curves help bounce bullets away doodBigBrain
[2:02:11] <%StaceMcGate> We can summon dragons, but boob armor is too much
[2:02:18] <NoireRequiem> brumhila armour
[2:02:22] <dmysta3000> Must protct da tiddies
[2:02:27] <%fingalights> They must know
[2:02:28] <Xelhesia> sorry Moobot capslock :(
[2:02:29] <@Solidus_113> NEW LP TIME
[2:02:30] <+ekimthegib> Nudity is Strength, the Kill La Kill maxim
[2:02:35] <dundore77> and those fantasy armors would 100% result in being impaled since it would roll into the center of the chest.
[2:02:39] <Solidnick18> New LP PogChamp
[2:02:42] <rheviel> it's cool
[2:02:42] <heartlesshealer> But if a dent gets put in that, then permanently dented tit unless you can get the armor off
[2:02:44] <rubbishbinge> Granblue Story Mode GOOOOO
[2:02:46] <heartlesshealer> goodbye bloodflow
[2:02:50] <+goodfeila> Wouldn't boob armor greatly increase the risk of the armor piercing your heart if you're struck?
[2:03:00] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> huh
[2:03:01] <+ekimthegib> noice
[2:03:06] <Dragon_Batman> I could only imagine
[2:03:06] <+primax104> that's pretty cool Minh!
[2:03:07] <%StaceMcGate> FF7 PC music was traaash
[2:03:10] <muniea3> so it's your fault the mouths are fucked up?
[2:03:13] <rubbishbinge> Minh made FFVII on PC?
[2:03:15] <toomuchsnarf> That’s dope
[2:03:18] <NoireRequiem> I like the PC version now
[2:03:18] <Dragon_Batman> It had the BJ mouths
[2:03:19] <TonyPullMyDTRedgrave> @goodfeila yes actually, but it's fantasy so we default to not asking those questions sokoSmile
[2:03:20] <Belutima> @dundore77 yeah no, that is pretty much debunked by medieval enthusiasts.
[2:03:20] <%Exiliator> Its all Minhs fault confirmed!
[2:03:22] <Prevot> if you're gonna take issue with the breastplate surely you'd take issue with cloud swingin a sword his own size
[2:03:23] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> now blame Minh for all its mistakes
[2:03:25] <%fingalights> Mihn Made FFVII
[2:03:40] <ALTRNico> you worked on the shitty one?
[2:03:44] <haisho> Minh was responsible for the O faces?
[2:03:44] <%StaceMcGate> David Cage made FFVII
[2:03:45] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> he worked on the not bad one LUL
[2:03:46] <Fujiwara_92> Minh invented FF7 Kappa
[2:03:46] <%gatorafan> Minh SINGLEHANDELY ported FFVII to Steam
[2:03:53] <+BionoidLCR> @goodfeila yea doing sections like that instead of it just being the hump like we see in other content makes it thinner
[2:03:54] <%fingalights> Yes, sorry Minh
[2:03:58] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @goodfeila Yeah, there's a real psaBig chance of you outright dying if you get a big blow to the chest
[2:04:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Mihn Created God
[2:04:06] <+DreyfussFrost> No way, Minh's too young to have worked on the original PC version. He's talking about the Steam port.
[2:04:12] <%StaceMcGate> that was a fanmod
[2:04:22] <+DreyfussFrost> Steam did not EXIST yet when the original PC port came out.
[2:04:28] <+Parrish_broadnax> Not all the time
[2:04:36] <Belutima> .... why would mihn think mods are official.
[2:04:38] <%Exiliator> Not all the time, but most of the time
[2:04:44] <+nekodelic> is Jessie a femcel?
[2:04:46] <%DatAsuna> Get set up for skyrim
[2:04:47] <+DreyfussFrost> The one with the MIDI soundtrack is pre-Steam.
[2:04:47] <%BallerSwagBro9k> TELL US
[2:04:57] <%fingalights> FF7 modding is way better know, 7th Heaven 2.0 should be out now

[2:27:37] <BaslerJones> therei s a kart mod too right ?
[2:27:38] <@Menitta> Woolie probably loves Sonic 3D Blast
[2:27:38] <rubbishbinge> Leggman
[2:27:42] <%FuqBoiSlim> Leggman
[2:27:42] <Vyneci> And this was further modified into a Kart game LUL
[2:27:43] <ac3_uchiha> It looks wild tho
[2:27:43] <%StaceMcGate> but can Sanic go fast?
[2:27:48] <Triplicat> next race wars confirmed for SBR2Kart then
[2:27:48] <+HawkGoggles2> Woolie doesn't like change. Kappa

[2:28:14] <BaslerJones> @OkamiDude15 NICE, someone should show woolie megaman 8bit deathmatch
[2:28:16] <+NarcissistCactus> :D
[2:28:25] <NocturnalScotsman> looks cool, I bet the mouse is actually more accurate unless you turn down analog sensitivity tho
[2:28:30] <+DreyfussFrost> This actually looks REALLY close to the concept I had for how Sonic should have translated to 3D. I was never going to actually make anything, so glad someone had the same idea.

[2:35:24] <xxterminatorviixx> Very megaman legends
[2:35:27] <+Ahegaliant> eli5 why do people get motion sickness in games?
[2:35:32] <+iFranzC> Fang was also known as Nack the Weasel.
[2:35:33] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> so how is he not motion sick from this but regular old FPS do it to him
[2:35:33] <%Exiliator> I prefer coke
[2:35:37] <+NekoNinja13> has woolie played sonic utopia?
[2:35:45] <+HawkGoggles2> Magaman legends is a fully 3D game, what the hell are you on about.
[2:35:47] <%Javaa01> The future is NOW, the future is DOOM
[2:35:48] <DaKnightWarrior> looks fantastic.
[2:35:49] <mindydragon> bad end
[2:35:50] <+TopTieramisu> hey
[2:35:51] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Is this a fan game?
[2:35:52] <Solidnick18> yeah this should have been it
[2:35:54] <%jiggy_snipe> naw
[2:35:54] <BaslerJones> this feels more like mario 64
[2:35:54] <+TopTieramisu> mario 64 is amazing
[2:35:58] <%FuqBoiSlim> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli He'll start feeling when the camera gets caught on a wall or something
[2:36:00] <OkamiDude15> yeah this is a fan game
[2:36:01] <TomFrank> mario 64 is good though
[2:36:02] <Solidnick18> This is a fan game yes
[2:36:05] <%jiggy_snipe> Legends and Mario 64 are fine 3d
[2:36:06] <WaifusSansFrontieres> sonic colors was good, generaitons was good
[2:36:06] <+thackattack00> Woolie has explained that his motion sickness only comes in when the camera gets too close to walls
[2:36:06] <resloxxx> Woolie "3D was a mistake" Madden
[2:36:08] <+stef5949> HARD disagree
[2:36:09] <%FuqBoiSlim> WE HAVE TO GO BACK
[2:36:10] <GarbageNirvana> @Ahegaliant You know how folks get car sickness if they're reading something while the car's moving? Same concept
[2:36:11] <DaKnightWarrior> This music is so great.
[2:36:11] <+thackattack00> Like face inside the wall close
[2:36:12] <+theAncopro> mario 64 was a mistake -woolie

[2:36:17] <muniea3> here we are, on Woolies lawn
[2:36:17] <Solidnick18> Fans do sonic better
[2:36:17] <$QueequegTheater> Maybe it's because I'm a child of the 2000s instead of the 90s (born in 93), but I just don't care that much about sprites
[2:36:20] <RoldanDgr8> Kinda just looks like Croc
[2:36:21] <halfmasks> @Ahegaliant eyes are detecting motion your inner ears arent feeling, brain gets super uncomfortable causing nausea
[2:36:22] <%ChoculaUltra> any granblue people here? I just got my copy of GBV and I'm torn between the Sunlight Stone and the Evolite

[2:40:28] <resloxxx> oh god dont make me remember
[2:40:29] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> two tails, on elife
[2:40:29] <+NotHereToStream> can't believe tail is fucking dead
[2:40:30] <mindydragon> stop I'm dealing with small gunpla parts NotLikeThis
[2:40:31] <%Grayhammatter> tails did not get the bubble
[2:40:33] <arkv01> blood and fur
[2:40:34] <@Menitta> Wait this has a homing attack
[2:40:35] <$QueequegTheater> HIS NAME IS MILES PER HOUR. FUCK YOU
[2:40:39] <$QueequegTheater> HOW
[2:40:40] <BurdRightsActivist> What fuckin game is this?
[2:40:41] <Vyneci> Sonic Mania exists Reggie
[2:40:42] <$QueequegTheater> AHHHHH
[2:40:46] <+TopTieramisu> sega encourages fangames because they know they can't make good sonic games
[2:40:47] <Froyuken> Seriously, what is this?
[2:40:48] <@Menitta> Sonic Adventure first had that
[2:40:50] <rubbishbinge> No homing attack, only THOK
[2:40:50] <turbofolk> what nintendont
[2:40:54] <%SomersaultJustice> "we can't make em good anymore so you do it"
[2:40:55] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Hell, Sonic Mania was made by people who made fangames
[2:40:55] <+greatgetter> Sonic Mania is made by fans that sega hired
[2:40:57] <@Solidus_113> They have to allow it because Sonic Team can't make good games for shit
[2:40:57] <OkamiDude15> the game is sonic robo blast 2 chat
[2:40:57] <%Javaa01> Especially since most ACTUAL Sonic games are straight garbage
[2:41:00] <heartlesshealer> Sonic Robo Blast 2
[2:41:02] <rcand9> this looks better than most 3d sonic shit
[2:41:04] <GarbageNirvana> If Sega didn't encourage fangames we wouldn't have Sonic Mania
[2:41:12] <critfumble_> BWEAW
[2:41:15] <rheviel> Sega does what Nintendon't
[2:41:18] <arkv01> ok all hype and jokes aside, I don't think the general public would eat this up though
[2:41:18] <absolute_cagemony> when tails lifts sonic up like that it gets him all porked up
[2:41:19] <+TopTieramisu> sonic mania was made by fan game makers
[2:41:22] <arkv01> it's just people like us
[2:41:24] <turbofolk> team sonicnis filled with drug addicts that dont know
[2:41:24] <Froyuken> This looks like what Sonic Extreme for Saturn would've been.
[2:41:25] <+TopTieramisu> but just officially under sonic
[2:41:28] <WaifusSansFrontieres> stuff like this can only come from a community that also has The Darkness inside of it
[2:41:28] <%linSP> If my dream sonic is if sonic CD was 3D like this
[2:41:29] <OkamiDude15> genesis denesis what nintendesis
[2:41:38] <dmc5nero> is this a fan made sonic game?
[2:41:41] <+TheOneCalledRock> I will always defend some of the modern sonic games like generations and colors, but yeah sega are idiots with this franchise
[2:41:42] <JoeNeutrino> What's in that minecraft house?
[2:41:52] <WaifusSansFrontieres> if the sonic fanbase were any less crazy, this stuff wouldnt be made, gotta take the good with the yiff
[2:41:55] <muniea3> gotta
[2:41:57] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> the static shield usually attracts rinsg too
[2:41:59] <Solidnick18> huh
[2:42:00] <dmc5nero> this is bullshit like theres no bad mario games so why are there bad sonic games?
[2:42:01] <+TopTieramisu> look at the state of sonic compared to mario and you know how much they f'd up
[2:42:11] <absolute_cagemony> Vita does what Nintendoes
[2:42:13] <+NarcissistCactus> what
[2:42:14] <OkamiDude15> ITS NIGHTS?
[2:42:16] <+theAncopro> excuse
[2:42:16] <$QueequegTheater> @WaifusSansFrontieres I don't understand the distinction

[2:42:57] <@Menitta> Rather fuck the Wii Nighrs Game
[2:43:02] <StarlitStunner> Nights ending theme is great tho
[2:43:05] <rubbishbinge> This is the Sonic pinball thing from ADventure
[2:43:06] <JoeNeutrino> I was excited
[2:43:06] <arkv01> DUDE THIS IS JUST BID FOR POWER
[2:43:10] <Belutima> Reminds me of nights doodStare
[2:43:14] <Vyneci> Making a Sonic fangame wasn't enough, they had to make Nights fangame too

[2:43:42] <WaifusSansFrontieres> fans made sonic mania right? there is a chance sega will let this happen
[2:43:45] <$QueequegTheater> THE CHAOS EMERALDS
[2:43:47] <$QueequegTheater> OBAMA NO
[2:43:48] <+TopTieramisu> 3d wasn't a mistake. sonic adventure was
[2:43:50] <arkv01> premature 3D climax
[2:43:50] <@Solidus_113> We needed to upgrade Mode 7
[2:43:51] <%FuqBoiSlim> aaaaaand downloaded see yall latee
[2:43:53] <@Menitta> Woolie is backing down from his HOT TAKE

[2:44:02] <%Grayhammatter> YO! SourPls
[2:44:02] <dmc5nero> the fan made sonic games are better than most of the newer sonic games which is sad and cool
[2:44:03] <halfmasks> this is the genius kojumbo
[2:44:06] <Solidnick18> This is some nice music
[2:44:12] <rheviel> muuuuusic
[2:44:13] <turbofolk> 3D era shouldve started 10 years ago in 2010
[2:44:13] <Froyuken> Not FMVs but the in-game cutscene.
[2:44:15] <rcand9> a trip rather than full mistake
[2:44:16] <@Menitta> that take still has radiation that cannot be neglected
[2:44:22] <critfumble_> dont worry woolie, youre slight against the sonic adventure series, I WONT LET IT GET TO ME
[2:44:23] <%ChoculaUltra> "You know what people would really want to do in a 3D Sonic game?! FISH." - Sega, 1998
[2:44:23] <ALTRNico> NO CHILL
[2:44:27] <+TheOneCalledRock> alright yeah, i agree with the 3D too early bit
[2:44:31] <@Solidus_113> Sprites are expensive Woolie
[2:44:32] <Froyuken> No. Should've started in 2000.
[2:44:35] <+Adulfzen> oh wow I started playing this yesterday
[2:44:38] <valentinevergil> sega can only go up from now on...eentually
[2:44:39] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Was this music made specifically for this game? Because this is a really good soundtrack
[2:44:41] <Vyneci> WE ZOOMIN
[2:44:41] <+DRAGKUDO> Wait super sonic collects emeralds he should already have?
[2:44:45] <%Grayhammatter> just GO!

[2:44:57] <rcand9> yoooooo
[2:44:58] <GarbageNirvana> Sega was Icarus and the Dreamcast was their wax wings
[2:45:01] <+LTKonnor> I don't think you understand how fast I really am
[2:45:05] <RoldanDgr8> running looks kinda bad tho
[2:45:06] <halfmasks> we got TECH PogChamp
[2:45:11] <@Menitta> I still wish Sonic Utopia was a real game
[2:45:13] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> shiny
[2:45:15] <restingbones> Sonicc?
[2:45:15] <$QueequegTheater> What about the harem route
[2:45:15] <Solidnick18> SourPls
[2:45:15] <+griffball13> no matter how fast i run i cannot escape the pain
[2:45:17] <JoeNeutrino> Ironically, the series about the super fast Hedgehog should have slowed the fuck down.
[2:45:19] <+Adulfzen> I need to try the Kart game
[2:45:19] <rcand9> WHY ISNT THIS MY CHILDHOOD?????
[2:45:24] <+TopTieramisu> tbf, the dreamcast didn't kill sega, it just didn't do well enough to save them
[2:45:29] <OkamiDude15> the nights stage made me sick for a bit but maybe its because im not in control
[2:45:35] <turbofolk> Stop fucking around woolie we wanna see SPEED
[2:45:50] <%Grayhammatter> why is this actually so good?
[2:45:50] <halfmasks> Full LP lets go, right into my veins
[2:45:53] <%jiggy_snipe> it is weird that Woolie is not bothered by this when he said that old school fps bothered in Doom
[2:45:54] <+Adulfzen> the air control in this game is pretty tight
[2:46:03] <resloxxx> Cognitive Disorder
[2:46:06] <+griffball13> this is my 15 years ago today
[2:46:07] <spacecatstreams> i had this on my n64
[2:46:09] <+zaibatsu_member_333> @WoolieVersus Is that how that works?
[2:46:11] <+zaibatsu_member_333> o_0
[2:46:15] <+eanscrale> Do you mean saturn?
[2:46:15] <%FuqBoiSlim> okay so apparently there's a genesis port too? let's go...
[2:46:17] <%ChoculaUltra> "Pff, only REAL Sonic fans would know about this, okay?"
[2:46:18] <%jiggy_snipe> should have been the Sega Saturn Sonics
[2:46:19] <GarbageNirvana> Mandela Effect SRB2 into your childhood
[2:46:23] <heartlesshealer> had it on Windows 98
[2:46:25] <TomFrank> if this came out after sonic and knuckles sonic 06 would never have happened
[2:46:26] <turbofolk> just like sonic dreams
[2:46:28] <+HawkGoggles2> come one this is being put on the saturn.
[2:46:29] <%Ipsenscastle> The Saturn would've run this really well, that's the saddest thing
[2:46:29] <Solidnick18> oh nice
[2:46:36] <SuperKirby24> imagine if this was on the saturn PogChamp
[2:46:39] <restingbones> Woolie update the stream to say what game youre playing, COS I WANT TO KNOW
[2:46:39] <Belutima> RETCON your childhood
[2:46:39] <halfmasks> why does my grandma suddenly have a sega genesis in her earn
[2:46:40] <JoeNeutrino> yeah, this is an obscure Saturn game
[2:46:45] <+D4C_Trice> what is this?
[2:46:50] <Solidnick18> yeah lot of love for this
[2:46:50] <%FuqBoiSlim> this game has a genesis port. it could've ran on the Saturn fine
[2:46:53] <+griffball13> We need to patch our childhoods
[2:46:53] <GarbageNirvana> Sonic Robo Blast 2 for folks asking
[2:46:54] <@Menitta> LUL
[2:46:55] <OkamiDude15> @D4C_Trice sonic robo blast 2
[2:46:58] <$QueequegTheater> Which version of Chrono Trigger should I play? I know almost nothing about the story but I have been told the DS version is the best, is that accurate?
[2:47:06] <heartlesshealer> Sonic Robo Blast 2 is the game
[2:47:10] <Prevot> DS version
[2:47:17] <%SomersaultJustice> moogle token
[2:47:18] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @QueequegTheater Yeah, DS version is best
[2:47:25] <@Menitta> "Why is there a Sega Saturn in my grandpa's coffin?!"
[2:47:26] <+thackattack00> Just make sure you don't play the Steam version
[2:47:26] <+D4C_Trice> this is a weird looking game to me
[2:47:38] <spardanwarrior> DS version has extra content
[2:47:39] <+NarcissistCactus> and then they unfigured it out
[2:47:40] <spacecatstreams> and then they un-figured it out
[2:47:41] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> and then they didnt
[2:47:43] <$QueequegTheater> @thackattack00 Yeah, I heard it was trash (and also emulators are free)
[2:47:43] <%jiggy_snipe> and Sonic 1 wasn't bad per se
[2:47:45] <spacecatstreams> damn you cactus
[2:47:46] <+TopTieramisu> sonic's that classroom rival that stayed in the hometown while mario went on to become elon musk
[2:47:47] <+griffball13> OH NO
[2:47:48] <+NarcissistCactus> atpRtsd
[2:47:50] <+huggablemantooth> who made this?
[2:47:51] <$QueequegTheater> Thanks chat
[2:47:54] <+TopTieramisu> in his*
[2:47:55] <heartlesshealer> @QueequegTheater DS version is a good one to go with
[2:47:57] <WaifusSansFrontieres> @QueequegTheater pc version with the content restoration mod that vinny on vsauce used
[2:48:09] <%FuqBoiSlim> Friendship Theme
[2:48:13] <halfmasks> no lie, this style of 3d is low key 「menacing」, everything turns to face you
[2:48:14] <%SomersaultJustice> If DS version is too hard to get, you can try the PC version
[2:48:16] <rcand9> how did sega miss this slam fuckin dunk?
[2:48:17] <%Grayhammatter> that guitar though
[2:48:26] <%jepupu> Sonic = 90s edgy. Shadow = 00s edgy.
[2:48:29] <+TopTieramisu> tbf, it's not a slam dunk
[2:48:29] <%Ipsenscastle> Sonic was my favourite thing in the 90s
[2:48:30] <WaifusSansFrontieres> pc version has massive issues but you can path those out
[2:48:31] <+kyh9> Butt Rock!
[2:48:40] <$QueequegTheater> @SomersaultJustice I literally just downloaded the DS rom
[2:48:50] <oAznoUta> the blue orb sounds! Kreygasm
[2:48:51] <GunlaEXE> toxic plateau sourpls
[2:48:51] <$QueequegTheater> Thanks everyone
[2:48:53] <%SomersaultJustice> that works
[2:48:53] <Mangahero18> All joking aside this game is legitimately better than like 2/3rds of sonic games. Hell this game is better than Sonic Forces for sure. I wouldnt say its better than Sonic Adventure 2 though...
[2:49:01] <+TopTieramisu> mario evolved with the times
[2:49:05] <+TopTieramisu> sonic just made the wrong steps
[2:49:14] <MattoBii> this is literally just nights now
[2:49:14] <Solidnick18> PogChamp
[2:49:15] <%FuqBoiSlim> Toxic Plateau? you mean Overwatch? LUL
[2:49:15] <+NekoNinja13> @woolieversus have you tried Sonic Utopia? its a really great proof of concept for a true 3d sonic. this and sonic utopia share alot of the same energy I feel
[2:49:28] <@Menitta> The Wii Nights is fucking terrible
[2:49:30] <Guardiansaiyan> !uptime
[2:49:30] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 49 minutes
[2:49:57] <$QueequegTheater> !raffle
[2:50:02] <halfmasks> is there any dev thats been so consitently blown up by fan-games more than team sonic?
[2:50:03] <Froyuken> I legit only played Nights: Journey to Dreams once and haven't touched it again.
[2:50:03] <RoldanDgr8> Most of Nights is terrible
[2:50:06] <+TopTieramisu> i want a nights remake
[2:50:17] <Belutima> Honestly think Max and Simmons should give this game a try.
[2:50:18] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1234692167358177282?s=19
[2:50:23] <Froyuken> But the children in Nights could walk around the environment, though.
[2:50:31] <TomFrank> its a little slow for sonic, but still great
[2:50:31] <xxterminatorviixx> A Nights remake would be dope
[2:50:33] <@Menitta> Idk why I have such a burning hatred towards Wii Nights
[2:50:36] <datmouse> gitaroo nights
[2:50:39] <mexicansunglasses> Is this that new Final Fantasy VII remake?
[2:50:54] <%SlashHabit> SlashHabit subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:51:00] <xxterminatorviixx> But if settle for Jetset radio remake
[2:51:01] <DedlokPM> so what game is this rooBlank
[2:51:10] <GarbageNirvana> @Menitta Because DU-AL-IZE-UH
[2:51:15] <Froyuken> Alex Kidd needs a comeback.
[2:51:15] <%FuqBoiSlim> Sonic robo Blast 2
[2:51:15] <+D4C_Trice> i like to think that Kazuma Kiryu is the modern mascot for Sega
[2:51:18] <%Exiliator> That sound is AWFUL
[2:51:22] <%Exiliator> what the hell
[2:51:27] <Solidnick18> extra life
[2:51:27] <%jiggy_snipe> Kappa
[2:51:27] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> WHAT
[2:51:28] <+TopTieramisu> now he's a hedgehog with a ranger boyfriend
[2:51:29] <Prevot> oh god always with the human girlfriend
[2:51:30] <%Exiliator> ow
[2:51:33] <+prime_name> Nights?
[2:51:36] <%SomersaultJustice> oh it's still going
[2:51:36] <DedlokPM> There was a Sonic Robo Blast 1? rooBlank
[2:51:43] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> so Roger Rabbit
[2:51:45] <%jiggy_snipe> so Sonic 06 was truly what they wanted since the beginning
[2:51:49] <DaKnightWarrior> lytALRIGHT
[2:51:53] <%FuqBoiSlim> there was but it was an shitass sidescroller
[2:51:55] <GunlaEXE> srb1 is... interesting
[2:51:56] <+Doc1790> Now he's a Hedgehog with a human girlfriend Kappa
[2:51:57] <darkryu31765> Yo
[2:52:07] <+TopTieramisu> @Doc1790 boyfriend
[2:52:25] <GarbageNirvana> Saturn was built for sprites in an era when polygons were taking over
[2:52:26] <+prime_name> I mean, they did bring it back for the Wii
[2:52:28] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> daily reminder Nights is dead
[2:52:29] <+HawkGoggles2> Was Sakura wars the only thing that survived the Saturn?
[2:52:32] <+NekoNinja13> NiGHTS could have had alot of potential as a series imho
[2:52:37] <%gatorafan> For a moment I thought Sonic was jumping out of the water like Echo daedra1DerpyTibs
[2:52:40] <+TopTieramisu> a full 3d nights would be fun
[2:52:45] <%KingLlama1> KingLlama1 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! The only SEGA mascot worth a damn is Segata Sanshiro
[2:52:46] <%gatorafan> Ecco
[2:53:06] <+TopTieramisu> i feel like a flying character can handle the blinding speed a sonic fan would crave in 3d better
[2:53:12] <+jorgamund> @NekoNinja13 yeah, it was great for the EXACT time it was released... but didn't grow and lost the window
[2:53:13] <+Proxzo> I just got a FF7 Butterfinger Commercial from tuning into your channel. LETS GO.
[2:53:20] <+Roivas1991> Is this a mod of NiGHTS?
[2:53:23] <speximillian> I could swear they brought back NiGHTS on the Wii. I might be crazy
[2:53:31] <%jiggy_snipe> poop
[2:53:31] <%gatorafan> @roivas1991, It's actually a mod of DOOM
[2:53:33] <BaslerJones> You guys remember spiral knights ?
[2:53:38] <+Doc1790> Ecco the Dolphin is just a Horror Game in disguise
[2:53:55] <Prevot> this shit is pretty disorienting when he goes fast
[2:54:01] <+chiluzza> the Doom engine is fucking strong
[2:54:02] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> DOOM saved Sonic
[2:54:07] <rcand9> DOOM IS sonic now
[2:54:14] <+griffball13> Doom mods are insane there so many good ones
[2:54:16] <+Roivas1991> Actually, looking at the background, I can see the DOOM in this.
[2:54:24] <+TopTieramisu> by the transitive property, isabelle is sonic

[3:05:43] <OkamiDude15> woolie speaks from experience of his christian childhood Kappa
[3:05:51] <GarbageNirvana> I mean he's 100% right
[3:05:54] <+prime_name> I mostly blame Panders
[3:06:01] <Mangahero18> So what woolie is saying...is that Christian Parents are ultimately responsible for Sonic R34 Mpreg fan art.
[3:06:04] <arkv01> @FuqBoiSlim oh yeah that was uh... one way to explain chakra and tailed beasts
[3:06:04] <%fingalights> Sounds solid
[3:06:04] <Valentinius_Anodyne> This is making a lot of sense
[3:06:06] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> ok but is anything without violence cool at all

[3:08:51] <+DreyfussFrost> That's what happens when you shelter your kids. Can't handle a theme song.
[3:09:03] <DedlokPM> between 2 and 3 IIRC
[3:09:04] <PleasantLeech> I still remember the commerical to the American grudge movie
[3:09:05] <heartlesshealer> It was reggie, @zal_silverfang

[3:09:19] <RosTea> SRB2K YESSS
[3:09:23] <rubbishbinge> Super Mario 64 made me scared of eels until I realized they tasted good
[3:09:29] <%gatorafan> I don't quite like that Sonic can float.
[3:09:32] <+zaibatsu_member_333> my parents went to take me to get Mortal Kombat 4
[3:09:33] <%gatorafan> It triggers me
[3:09:39] <%fingalights> What?
[3:09:40] <bsmusic> NotLikeThis
[3:09:41] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Oh no
[3:09:43] <zal_silverfang> also, the fuck IS this? did sonic jam come early>

[3:09:45] <Prevot> fuck that Mario eel
[3:09:45] <%BallerSwagBro9k> REALLY?
[3:09:50] <@Menitta> I believe Woolie's Christian Theory
[3:09:53] <@Menitta> of Sonic
[3:09:53] <DontChuckle98> You guys gonna check out the kart racer of this game?
[3:09:56] <heartlesshealer> Machinima whuh?
[3:09:59] <dan_g_v> and the Netflix series
[3:10:02] <NoireRequiem> the animated film and a live action one
[3:10:02] <@Menitta> Oh yeah Sonic for Hire is back
[3:10:12] <zal_silverfang> F for Machinima
[3:10:21] <NoireRequiem> Assasin's fist was good imo
[3:10:30] <+zaibatsu_member_333> @rubbishbinge the eel is still scary :c
[3:10:33] <@Menitta> He became god and then didnt
[3:10:34] <PleasantLeech> ass fist for short
[3:10:40] <omegadarknes> jeez, 30 second rocket league advertisement
[3:10:43] <%LordSDB> It was good, They didn't do too much
[3:11:06] <%LordSDB> Even had a good way for putting in ryu theme song in.
[3:11:13] <Prevot> you just wait until that live action One Piece show comes out
[3:11:19] <+zaibatsu_member_333> >Not getting the Sonic Drive in ad
[3:11:26] <zal_silverfang> fir AND water shield?
[3:11:26] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1234692167358177282?s=19
[3:11:32] <+zaibatsu_member_333> are we even watching the same stream
[3:11:37] <NoireRequiem> the dynamic between the actors was good, but budget was very noticeable
[3:11:38] <Explodincatz> it was good
[3:11:43] <omegadarknes> The stream isn't tagged with the game you're playing, idk if that is intentional?
[3:11:45] <@Menitta> I liked Sonic more than Detective Pikachu tbh
[3:11:55] <b_ikki> detective pikachu was super dry
[3:11:57] <absolute_cagemony> what is this torture ball???
[3:12:00] <Mangahero18> agreed
[3:12:15] <Mangahero18> Pikachu was decent but Sonic was actually pretty good.
[3:12:19] <@Menitta> See Detective Pikachu had a huge mystery behind it yet it was hyper obvious
[3:12:21] <DedlokPM> You know what is good?
[3:12:21] <rubbishbinge> Jim Carrey plays Eggman playing Jim Carrey
[3:12:25] <+treborant> Sonic was better
[3:12:25] <DedlokPM> Olive Garden
[3:12:28] <zal_silverfang> bold words woolie
[3:12:28] <+KeithTheHuman> pikachu had a sloppy ending imo
[3:12:28] <PleasantLeech> I liked the third man section of detective pikachu
[3:12:29] <Explodincatz> sonic was a better main character
[3:12:30] <@Menitta> Hey
[3:12:30] <zal_silverfang> i like it
[3:12:31] <Belutima> Reggie didnt GO doodBait wow fake fan
[3:12:33] <HollowMan190> it's a kids movie it's okay if it's bad
[3:12:37] <@Menitta> When you're at Olive Garden
[3:12:40] <+zaibatsu_member_333> you need the Bubble sheild
[3:12:42] <@Menitta> You're Family(tm)
[3:12:48] <%gatorafan> I loved how that bubble interacted with the Oil Ocean Zone on Mania
[3:12:50] <+primax104> is this on the build engine?
[3:12:57] <@Menitta> Olive Garden Zone
[3:13:01] <+nekodelic> Is sonic the best hollywood adaptation of a videogame?
[3:13:02] <dan_g_v> they knew what they were doing
[3:13:04] <HollowMan190> what is this
[3:13:06] <Siregulus> wait until we get to the next zone
[3:13:12] <%Grayhammatter> just like doom
[3:13:16] <OkamiDude15> @primax104 if thats the doom engine than yes
[3:13:18] <rubbishbinge> @primax104 Doom engine
[3:13:21] <PleasantLeech> it's like it's a actual sonic level
[3:13:21] <HollowMan190> looks like a Nightmar
[3:13:29] <+primax104> @OkamiDude15 yeah that's it
[3:13:29] <dan_g_v> woolie really should update the title of the stream
[3:13:36] <@Menitta> I'd say I enjoyed the Sonic movie the most compared to every other video game movie
[3:13:41] <NoireRequiem> Remember when eggman said Omoshiroi straight up
[3:13:46] <absolute_cagemony> The Woolie Furcast
[3:13:50] <+zaibatsu_member_333> yeah
[3:13:50] <%gatorafan> I don't think this game is available on Twitch's list of games, is it?
[3:13:52] <@Menitta> Except for the SF movie but thats like....ironic fun
[3:13:52] <zal_silverfang> this is basically the level design that that sonic 3D open world project "Sonic Paradise?" needs
[3:13:54] <%FuqBoiSlim> these levels manage to be huge without taking an eternity to complete unlike heroes
[3:13:57] <arkv01> get in the kigurumi, woolie
[3:14:01] <Siregulus> @gatorafan nope, there's no game category for it
[3:14:05] <%Grayhammatter> SourPls
[3:14:10] <drefizz> I have heard several times from different people that sonic's movie is better than detective
[3:14:10] <GarbageNirvana> Too fast
[3:14:10] <autcetera> Why does the purple juice sound make me so horny
[3:14:12] <%gatorafan> So he can't update the title
[3:14:25] <OkamiDude15> @autcetera that sounds like a you problem
[3:14:26] <Siregulus> well, woolie CAN, but it'd have to be a different game category
[3:14:38] <%fingalights> @autcetera you know why
[3:14:41] <RosTea> lmao
[3:14:43] <Siregulus> I think people just use sonic the hedgehog for this???
[3:14:45] <@Menitta> Technically Woolie could say hes playing DOOM
[3:14:49] <dan_g_v> why can't he update?
[3:14:56] <RosTea> you out here *horny* horny/
[3:14:56] <@Menitta> the game has no category
[3:14:59] <+Rlexp> this looks anti fun
[3:15:00] <drefizz> SourPls
[3:15:04] <%gatorafan> Is there a fangame category? Maybe Retro?
[3:15:08] <Potatoidea> Games + Demos maybe
[3:15:16] <arkv01> DOOM (1993)
[3:15:17] <dan_g_v> then put it az. mukbang
[3:15:19] <b_ikki> corona proof
[3:15:23] <%Javaa01> Learn that bumperjumper
[3:15:29] <OkamiDude15> games + demos would work i guess
[3:15:37] <rubbishbinge> good shield
[3:15:39] <@Menitta> I can never get used to bumper jumper
[3:15:49] <dan_g_v> social eating
[3:15:51] <+zaibatsu_member_333> Double BOOST
[3:15:53] <OkamiDude15> i would assume as much
[3:15:55] <Belutima> @Menitta what @OkamiDude15 says seen allot of people do that. for random games
[3:16:00] <Abok6> this music is so good
[3:16:05] <GarbageNirvana> Titanfall 2 especially benefits really well from bumper jumper imo
[3:16:06] <PleasantLeech> I love bumper jumper controls
[3:16:08] <@Menitta> Put it in Games + demos?
[3:16:15] <Siregulus> might as well i guess
[3:16:15] <@Menitta> hm
[3:16:16] <rcand9> how many buttholes tho?
[3:16:27] <%FuqBoiSlim> the character sprites look great. like sonic is a mashup of regular classic and the ova sonic
[3:16:32] <Belutima> @Menitta yeah, seen some people who run old floopy disc games put it on that too. that dont hae a category etc.
[3:16:41] <b_ikki> steal the crown
[3:16:42] <PleasantLeech> B W O O P
[3:16:46] <arkv01> hell we could just throw it in Just Chatting
[3:16:49] <%Javaa01> I mean, if you want a proto-example of a bumperjumper layout before it existed, go look at DOOM on PS1, where you had strafing on the shoulder buttons
[3:17:06] <+zaibatsu_member_333> Best side kick
[3:17:11] <%Javaa01> Since it was ported before the Dualshock became standard
[3:17:15] <absolute_cagemony> Oh snap it's Dr Eggsock
[3:17:33] <bsmusic> games and demos would probably work best, since it's a catch-all category
[3:17:34] <+theAncopro> oh its chemical plant noss but 3d
[3:17:41] <Siregulus> also boss fights do the Sonic Rush thing where the more you get hit the farther out the rings go
[3:17:41] <you_violated_the_law____> everyone I know is playing sonic
[3:17:42] <OkamiDude15> chemical plant zone boss
[3:17:48] <you_violated_the_law____> is this jim carrey's fault?
[3:17:54] <PleasantLeech> didn't silent hill have strafing on the bumpers?
[3:17:59] <SheefEatsBeef> OH SHIT THIS TRACK SourPls
[3:18:04] <%FuqBoiSlim> one ring to rule them all
[3:18:11] <+theAncopro> uhoh

[3:19:01] <RosTea> Chao Garden.
[3:19:03] <lbrownthedestroyer> Sonic Dreams
[3:19:04] <%Javaa01> Adventure aged terribly, but it still has fun stuff, even if it is just to laugh at it
[3:19:06] <heartlesshealer> some of the statue stuff reminds me of Labyrinth zone

[3:19:30] <+TheOneCalledRock> sonic advance series is a runner up for me
[3:19:31] <+DreyfussFrost> 2 is great but I never understood why it gets more love than 3 & Knuckles. Sonic & Knuckles is just the best in every single way.
[3:19:33] <PleasantLeech> I think shadow the hedgehog is the only sonic game I've regen l beaten
[3:19:35] <@Menitta> oh shit I hope that doesnt fuck the VOD up

[3:20:00] <+NarcissistCactus> dead
[3:20:06] <SubjectX07x> Oof, I remember almost drowning as a kid, had to be saved by my older sister because the fuckin lifeguards at this public pool were too busy chatting to notice a kid was actually drowning.
[3:20:06] <drefizz> F

[3:20:52] <%ChoculaUltra> my older brother saved me from drowning when we were both young. Weirdly enough, I went on to learn how to swim and all that jazz. My brother on the other hand is sort of traumatized and hates water.
[3:20:59] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I almost drowned once, saved myself though, I don't think anyone noticed
[3:21:03] <SPidERMan8576> Escape to the world of anime
[3:21:05] <+theAncopro> i don't remember not being able to swim
[3:21:06] <+NarcissistCactus> and then god saved you
[3:21:13] <PleasantLeech> I didn't learn to swim add a child because going in a pool would give me ear infections
[3:21:15] <rubbishbinge> Water wings are still cool to this day

[3:22:15] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> I almost drowned because the lifegaurd was talking to some guy, th elast thought I had was "I won't be able to play mario 3 anymore"
[3:22:21] <PortableBoredom> Like that robot that can put it's arm back on. You can't.
[3:22:25] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> I actually jumped entirely the fuck out of the water somehow

[3:22:39] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> then I devoted my lif eto video games
[3:23:00] <OkamiDude15> as far as i remember i only blacked out once in a public pool and my dad saved me as a kid.. only learned how to swim later on in life around high school
[3:23:21] <%gatorafan> At least it doesn't have THE MUSIC
[3:23:36] <%FuqBoiSlim> FREEDOM
[3:23:39] <PleasantLeech> it's almost like humans are designed to live on land and not in the water
[3:23:41] <rcand9> reggies nightmare over
[3:23:49] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I still can't really swim effectively, I just can't float
[3:23:54] <rcand9> spoke too soon
[3:24:03] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> children shouldnt be allowed in a pool if they cant swim honestly
[3:24:03] <xxterminatorviixx> Oh god I hope this doesn’t have THOSE ENEMIES
[3:24:06] <+NekoNinja13> I've almost died 3 or 4 times, but none by water
[3:24:08] <Siregulus> damn woolie said fuck the gargoyle puzzle
[3:24:10] <Siregulus> lmao
[3:24:16] <black_pariah> why woolie

[3:24:27] <OkamiDude15> i can swim but i cant float lytBEATSME
[3:24:29] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> WHY NOT STAIRS
[3:24:31] <zal_silverfang> @Siregulus there was a puzzle?
[3:24:31] <PleasantLeech> @valentinius_anodyne a tip is to completely relax and float on you back
[3:24:43] <+TheOneCalledRock> i still don'r know how to swim as an adult FeelsBadMan
[3:24:51] <Siregulus> @zal_silverfang yeah you were intended to push a gargoyle into place and open the door but you dont have to go on that path
[3:25:03] <PleasantLeech> @theonecalledrock it's overrated
[3:25:03] <wanocountry> Which Sonic game is this?
[3:25:05] <%FuqBoiSlim> idk how to swim either but I'm quite buoyant
[3:25:07] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> and why is the ramp like 70 degrees
[3:25:09] <+JeluxDaCasual> Sonic Robo Blast 2

[3:25:46] <PleasantLeech> @valentinius_anodyne maybe you're too muscular, that can make it difficult to float.
[3:25:52] <+TheOneCalledRock> i find ironic though because i love going into the pool

[3:26:50] <%FuqBoiSlim> deeper into the abyss..
[3:26:53] <%jiggy_snipe> man this ost is good
[3:27:00] <%FuqBoiSlim> @okamidude15 yeah I was thinking that and sonic 2
[3:27:05] <OkamiDude15> yeah same
[3:27:21] <@Menitta> I wanna say my favorite sonic game is Generations
[3:27:26] <+prime_name> Reminds me of the Sonic Adventure 1 temple level.
[3:27:44] <+NekoNinja13> am I the o ly one who likes sonic lost worlds?
[3:27:45] <drefizz> LUL
[3:27:48] <castcola> monkaS
[3:27:49] <OkamiDude15> ive still never played generations but i did play the fuck out of the demo on 360
[3:27:52] <@Menitta> I wanted to like Lost World
[3:27:58] <drefizz> PogU
[3:27:59] <rubbishbinge> @NekoNinja13 yes
[3:28:02] <%gatorafan> @nekoninja13, you are on a big minority as far as the fandom is concerned
[3:28:03] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> I still think the best sonic game was on neo geo pocket
[3:28:17] <DetroitSentai> what game is this?
[3:28:23] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> it was the most modern with the least unnecessary shit
[3:28:24] <%FuqBoiSlim> I only played the 3ds version of lost worlds and that fell apart by like world 3
[3:28:28] <+theAncopro> Colors i thought was best
[3:28:46] <OkamiDude15> i feel like colors still holds up
[3:28:48] <drefizz> Rip tail
[3:28:50] <rcand9> what about bioshock Kappa
[3:29:00] <%Grayhammatter> aquatic ambience Kreygasm
[3:29:02] <@Menitta> Lost World should have been to Sonic what Mario 3D World is to Mario
[3:29:19] <PleasantLeech> which is the game where sonic has a sword?
[3:29:27] <drefizz> I like that this uses the SA1 spin dash sound
[3:29:27] <rubbishbinge> Black Knight
[3:29:27] <%gatorafan> Don't you guys love ZAVOK!!!??? daedra1DrunkTibs
[3:29:28] <OkamiDude15> speaking of bioshock. the collection is free on ps+ so grab it before they switch
[3:29:28] <DetroitSentai> Black Knight
[3:29:29] <+NekoNinja13> I really like lost worlds mechanics and it has some good levels
[3:29:29] <xxterminatorviixx> Dire Dire docks excuse
[3:29:29] <@Menitta> but instead it was a weird Not Mario Galaxy but Sonic thing
[3:29:30] <%FuqBoiSlim> sonic and the balck5knight
[3:29:31] <SheefEatsBeef> it was a failure of the game designer
[3:29:35] <heartlesshealer> Black Knight was sword autorun
[3:29:39] <+theAncopro> i like the idea of the parkour system in lost world but it needed more time to make work
[3:29:39] <%supersugoisenpai1> That Tomb Raider 2 level where you're miles underwater
[3:29:40] <SUSYOSANCHEZ> Black Knight
[3:29:41] <rubbishbinge> Knight of the Wind is fire
[3:29:56] <PleasantLeech> you're wrong woolie
[3:29:58] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> there were good water levels in In the Hunt
[3:29:58] <zal_silverfang> wind waker was due to time. Twilight princess was easy
[3:29:59] <DedlokPM> @PleasantLeech all of them
[3:29:59] <%gatorafan> NO??? Well have more of him until you LIKE HIM! daedra1DrunkTibs
[3:30:04] <OkamiDude15> knight of the wind is the dopest shit
[3:30:05] <@Menitta> They switched PS+ games for this month. Now its Shadow of the Colossus and SONIC FORCES
[3:30:16] <rubbishbinge> When's Crush 40 coming back ;-;
[3:30:17] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> also kirby water levels were actually fun
[3:30:27] <Solidnick18> sonic forces DansGame
[3:30:29] <zocano> I never remember having trouble with Ocarina’s water temple and I played it for the first time relatively recently
[3:30:31] <%FuqBoiSlim> @menitta WOW one the best games of the generation and Shadow of the Colossus? what a steal
[3:30:33] <OkamiDude15> sotc nkoPOG
[3:30:35] <+NekoNinja13> @theancopro completely agree
[3:30:42] <xxterminatorviixx> Really sonic forces
[3:30:43] <@Menitta> its a HUGE steal woolieREMEMBERS
[3:30:56] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> and megaman 2 let you jump really high in the water so that was a neat turnaround
[3:30:57] <%RedDragonMoth> roboblast
[3:30:59] <PleasantLeech> why do people complain about puzzles being difficult in zelda? it's a puzzle game!!
[3:31:04] <xxterminatorviixx> I mean infinite is cool I guess
[3:31:06] <drefizz> I did it first :)
[3:31:18] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Speaking of water levels, y'all should check out the music for the 2nd stratum of Etrian Odyssey 3, it's good stuff
[3:31:38] <Solidnick18> puzzle
[3:31:42] <SUSYOSANCHEZ> Lowkey Doom vibes, not gonna lie.
[3:31:53] <OkamiDude15> this is made on the doom engine so maybe thats why
[3:31:53] <Solidnick18> hmm
[3:31:55] <SixthSun2> They're very finnicky for what angle you can push them
[3:32:03] <GarbageNirvana> @SUSYOSANCHEZ Well it is a Doom WAD
[3:32:12] <%FuqBoiSlim> w00t
[3:32:15] <%gatorafan> Better at Puzzles than Pat PogChamp
[3:32:26] <+NekoNinja13> water levels could be very cool, but I feel like alot of designer just make them like ground levels with low gravity, when water levels could be almost as complex as space levels imho
[3:32:29] <SixthSun2> Or...

[3:42:30] <Cory_the_Dinosaur> best 3d sonic game?
[3:42:30] <Clowns> i was wondering why this looked better than any other sonic game
[3:42:34] <%FuqBoiSlim> Castle Eggenstein

[3:42:41] <+Parrish_broadnax> Eggette

[3:43:07] <CptVolkow> Robotnizk
[3:43:08] <%gatorafan> Is this Wolfenstein? daedra1DerpyTibs
[3:43:16] <+mankeyfigh> Egg man doesn’t seem like the guy to have a castle, he’s more of a Robo-Fortress kinda guy
[3:43:17] <Potatoidea> Sometimes you get Eggette and sometimes you get Dr. Video Games
[3:43:33] <DaKnightWarrior> lytONEMORE
[3:43:37] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> Fan theory: Eggman waits under my bed for me to go into my closet so he can lock me inside and steal my gameboy
[3:43:37] <%gatorafan> It's the Dark Souls of Sonic Fangames Keepo
[3:44:06] <SixthSun2> Honestly, I get more of a Castlevania vibe from this, especially when there's a Castlevania Doom mod
[3:44:16] <Mangahero18> @mankeyfigh please remember Eggman made an amusment park
[3:44:40] <rubbishbinge> Kintobor's Kastle
[3:44:43] <Belutima> like they say, dont overstay your welcome
[3:44:53] <+mankeyfigh> Yeah, Eggman’d more of a retro-futuristic kinda guy
[3:44:56] <heartlesshealer> music's pretty sweet
[3:44:56] <OkamiDude15> eggman land from unleashed and the amusement park from colors
[3:44:58] <DaKnightWarrior> that was cool
[3:44:59] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> All I cant remember is when Heihachi made a theme park
[3:45:15] <+mankeyfigh> I don’t know if he’d go for something classic like this
[3:45:26] <%gatorafan> Shield guys giving Woolie problems on Doom again Kappa

[3:47:16] <+lethallunacyx> SeemsGood
[3:47:18] <+Shindeil> Re: Sonic Adventure; Remember that the NA Dreamcast version is functionally better than DX.
[3:47:19] <SUSYOSANCHEZ> Are we gonna get some sick Pika Libre combos?
[3:47:28] <%ChoculaUltra> Switch you say... hmmm time to mull things over with my debit card.

[3:48:10] <PleasantLeech> pokken is okay but I think it has a really good selection of pokemon
[3:48:17] <Belutima> I only watch speedruns of shitty Sonic games LUL
[3:48:17] <stevenellis386> which sonic is this?
[3:48:23] <%gatorafan> I think Black Knight's story and characterization was cool, but that's as far as my praise goes. daedra1DerpyTibs
[3:48:28] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> it really doesnt because on eis a sentient candelabra
[3:48:29] <QuantumButler> the doom wad one
[3:48:30] <%FuqBoiSlim> Chandelure HYPE
[3:48:34] <rubbishbinge> Music in the Storybook games slapped
[3:48:42] <Siregulus> I love this path
[3:48:48] <speximillian> If they do Pokken, they better hit training mode first, that game is not a simple button masher.

[3:51:43] <Belutima> Tails got GOT
[3:51:58] <%gatorafan> Tails WOULD take a bullet for you.
[3:52:13] <darkbotle> The forward momentum in this game is just insane
[3:52:14] <1matheuw> mostly because hes imortal tho
[3:52:18] <speximillian> I remember this game from when I was growing up, there was only Sonic and Tails and 2 levels plus a boss back then...they kept working on it over the past decade lol
[3:52:29] <Vyneci> Thank fuck there's no 10 minute time limit in this

[3:57:44] <SixthSun2> Bounced off the enemy sheild LUL
[3:57:46] <+Jontman42> I guess it's a Sonic game since you should go fast but gaining momentum is difficult and you gotta stop all the fucking time so you never get to actually go fast

[4:05:08] <%FuqBoiSlim> yessir
[4:05:09] <Mangahero18> I just noticed those shield enemies are wearing pickelhaube's the spiked helmets common on german infantry in WW1
[4:05:12] <Mangahero18> References
[4:05:12] <+JeluxDaCasual> no split screen though
[4:05:15] <SixthSun2> Window, Woolie
[4:05:18] <Siregulus> there's splitscreen actually, in Multiplayer
[4:05:23] <SixthSun2> Ah well, nevermind
[4:05:23] <+onyxpunk> @Cure_Optimism yep
[4:05:35] <Cure_Optimism> Sweet, gonna be playing this shit.
[4:05:42] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> it probably has LAN also, since it's doom
[4:05:47] <%FuqBoiSlim> there's online racing too I believe
[4:05:50] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> modders cant stop you
[4:06:01] <1matheuw> tails a bitch
[4:06:09] <SixthSun2> The archers are both gunslinger AND trickster
[4:06:13] <QuantumButler> this track is sooooo good
[4:06:30] <QuantumButler> big castlevania energy
[4:06:41] <xxterminatorviixx> Any sword masters
[4:06:57] <notquitedead123> Is this the new Doom game?
[4:06:58] <Mangahero18> If by 'a couple' you mean over 10 lives. Grammar Woolie.
[4:07:18] <speximillian> This is the old Doom game
[4:07:55] <+MeatBomb> Doom WADS will FOREVER be relevant.
[4:08:02] <rubbishbinge> Find Caliburn
[4:08:03] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:08:21] <%FuqBoiSlim> Reminder this game is technically canon to doom
[4:08:37] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> cant wait for the sequel to this on the doom eternal engine
[4:08:44] <+canabananilism> Was Doom Guy's bunny a sonic OC?
[4:08:52] <%gatorafan> Doomguy would help Sonic free the animals
[4:08:58] <%FuqBoiSlim> @canabananilism ! FRENZY !

[4:10:11] <xxterminatorviixx> Homing attack
[4:10:16] <Siregulus> removed along with the room to the left @maplebaple7
[4:10:20] <Belutima> Spin and Dash, Spin and Dash until it is done doodCrazy
[4:10:24] <%FuqBoiSlim> Icarus flew too close to the sun
[4:10:35] <tylerpyre> what game is this
[4:10:36] <GarbageNirvana> I remember driving through here in Mario Kart 64
[4:10:40] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Sonic Robo Blast 2
[4:10:48] <+allups> why is this the best looking sonic game
[4:11:02] <QuantumButler> it's a DOOM wad
[4:11:06] <resloxxx> People actually cared
[4:11:08] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> people have been working on it 10 years
[4:11:09] <crimsonsaens> This map has big anti-Woolie vibes
[4:11:13] <+MeatBomb> Because it wasn't made by Sonic Team.
[4:11:15] <powerprotoman> yiu activelt backtracked
[4:11:16] <GarbageNirvana> Longer than that
[4:11:18] <DaKnightWarrior> how long until the timer runs out?
[4:11:19] <Cure_Optimism> It reminds me of that unreleased Saturn Sonic Game, but this actually looks good and not hideous
[4:11:26] <%FuqBoiSlim> no time limit here
[4:11:27] <GarbageNirvana> I remember seeing stuff on this back in like 2001
[4:11:29] <rubbishbinge> 10 minute levels tho
[4:11:34] <DaKnightWarrior> ok
[4:11:37] <+canabananilism> Seriously. This is a sonic game I'd actually be interested in playing. All of these levels are WAY more interesting than any other 3d sonic game i've seen
[4:11:42] <Siregulus> woolie understandably already lost in Castle Eggman 2
[4:11:46] <%FuqBoiSlim> theres no time limit in this game
[4:11:47] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> if sonic team worked on something ten years and cared about it, we'd all be living inside it now
[4:11:51] <Belutima> btw somehting I noticed all the stream titles are not The Woolie Versus show and nothing specific anymore, why is that?
[4:12:03] <SirMcSlushy> Damn, this game looks great.
[4:12:22] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> also I guess you can play phantasy star online 2 but let's not think too hard on this
[4:12:22] <Siregulus> sonic solo is "you better respect the level design"
[4:12:25] <%SilvaChariot0133> LUL
[4:12:27] <ScarfDeSmith> welp
[4:12:33] <%Grayhammatter> the FIRE?
[4:12:35] <DaKnightWarrior> F I R E
[4:12:36] <+canabananilism> @Belutima probably to keep the game a surprise if its new?
[4:12:37] <+onyxpunk> solo sonic is a nightmare in the next stage
[4:12:39] <%Grayhammatter> WOW
[4:12:47] <%Grayhammatter> that was a SNIPE
[4:12:49] <%FuqBoiSlim> "The fire hurts you?!"
[4:13:01] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Bye Tails
[4:13:07] <Siregulus> the robo-hoods are amazing at bullying you for sitting around
[4:13:07] <+MeatBomb> God, imagine what a beautiful cluster fuck when you mix Sonic with Symphony of the Night.
[4:13:14] <+Iambobbyjo> What the hell is this game?
[4:13:19] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> someone mod this so sonic shouts TORNADE when he uses that
[4:13:26] <SirMcSlushy> Sonic Robot Blast 2, old ass fan mod made in the Doom Engine.
[4:13:26] <%FuqBoiSlim> Sonic robo Blast 2
[4:13:29] <1matheuw> its kinda doom but realy isnt
[4:13:31] <Cure_Optimism> Someone needs to mod in glory kills
[4:13:36] <SixthSun2> There is a Genesis Sonic hack that basically makes it castlevania, even having bloody rings
[4:13:39] <+JeluxDaCasual> @Iambobbyjo Sonic Robo Blast 2 my guy.
[4:13:41] <xXxPS9xXx> @Iambobbyjo prequel to doom eternal LUL
[4:13:42] <%Grayhammatter> jesus christ
[4:13:46] <speximillian> I’m just waiting for SKELETON BALL
[4:13:47] <DaKnightWarrior> I really want to see a speedrun for this game.
[4:13:47] <BurdRightsActivist> Sonic Eternal Punishment 2
[4:13:57] <%FuqBoiSlim> Sonic Innocent Sin
[4:13:59] <+Iambobbyjo> Oh hell yeah
[4:14:04] <+canabananilism> cs:source surfing time
[4:14:13] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> I think there is LITERALLY a sonic hack on the steam workshop that transforms it into castlevania bloodlines
[4:14:21] <KaliasTV> Kind of reminds me of the 2006 castle levels, but with gameplay
[4:14:25] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> because steam workshop for sega classics is out of control
[4:14:31] <BurdRightsActivist> NICE
[4:14:34] <%Grayhammatter> NICE
[4:14:44] <+NekoNinja13> gotta go to work, have fun guys!

[4:15:39] <valriot> i just came in, is this a Doom mod
[4:15:45] <+canabananilism> This is a game that would have been DMCA'd to hell if it was Nintendo
[4:15:47] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Technically yes
[4:15:55] <+MeatBomb> You're wrong, this looks totally fuckin' RADICAL>
[4:16:02] <BurdRightsActivist> STFU
[4:16:04] <Siregulus> no respect for level design 😔
[4:16:06] <Cure_Optimism> Sega is cool with fans picking up the slack. I mean the last good Sonic game was Mania.
[4:16:07] <ViceKingKuma> What is this? it looks cool
[4:16:11] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Sonic Robo Blast 2

[4:21:22] <Siregulus> nope
[4:21:23] <%jiggy_snipe> no they haven't played kart
[4:21:25] <SirMcSlushy> Don't think they have yet Crimson
[4:21:26] <+MeatBomb> When this inevitability gets remade on the new Doom engine, will it just be called AND KNUCKLES?
[4:21:28] <+JeluxDaCasual> @crimsonsaens NO

[4:26:49] <enby_shout> thank you
[4:26:54] <%Grayhammatter> go fast, eat ass
[4:26:56] <+canabananilism> @WoolieVersus should probably change the stream title so people stop asking what this is
[4:27:15] <SixthSun2> He always has that as the title
[4:27:17] <+FreddyLeeSavage> this shit actually kinda cute
[4:27:20] <+Iambobbyjo> Sonic Adventure 3 is looking pretty good
[4:27:22] <crimsonsaens> LUL
[4:27:27] <%FuqBoiSlim> this is a fan game so it doesnt have a category on twitch I believe
[4:27:28] <%jiggy_snipe> i don't think its there because its a fan game
[4:27:45] <+PorterOfGames> Yup. Fangames can't have categories
[4:27:49] <SixthSun2> Spinballsy
[4:27:49] <+PorterOfGames> They SHOULD though
[4:27:51] <@Menitta> it doesn't have a category on twitch so its games and demos
[4:27:52] <enby_shout> this is fucking nuts for a fangame
[4:27:55] <%FuqBoiSlim> oh we poddin
[4:28:10] <ernie_turbo23> Its not a real game so it doesnt have a category Stfu already
[4:28:11] <+NeonFishFace> this is legit the best looking sonic game
[4:28:13] <%jiggy_snipe> gotta go fast
[4:28:16] <CptVolkow> npclip
[4:28:24] <+PorterOfGames> "Not a real game"
[4:28:24] <+canabananilism> Is this the castle superbeast I keep hearing about?
[4:28:27] <enby_shout> im gonna have to try this game
[4:28:28] <DaKnightWarrior> Tails was always the easy mode of sonic games.
[4:28:28] <stevenellis386> you can get a lot of mileage with tails
[4:28:29] <%FuqBoiSlim> this game is like 20 years in the making. I think it first came out in '98?
[4:28:37] <+PorterOfGames> If it plays like a game, and is fun to play, it's a game
[4:28:41] <theloganbrand> Fan games often have categories
[4:28:41] <@Menitta> I shouldn't have added a category mid stream cuz now the vod is in 2 separated chapters. my bad.
[4:28:41] <+PorterOfGames> Stop yo trolling
[4:28:50] <enby_shout> DUDE LOOK AT TAILS TIRED ASS FACE
[4:28:51] <enby_shout> aaa
[4:29:22] <ernie_turbo23> They wasted all that time making these Maze levels cause they thought it would be fun LOL NOPE
[4:29:22] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:29:24] <%FuqBoiSlim> character sprites in this game are 10/10
[4:29:45] <%Grayhammatter> yeyeyeye
[4:29:49] <crimsonsaens> I love this kind of level, but LP tax is rough
[4:29:52] <+Iambobbyjo> A speedrun of this game would be bonkers
[4:29:55] <+PorterOfGames> They're only a maze if you don't know the layout LUL
[4:30:11] <enby_shout> this is a while artstyle that should be tapped on more, like 2d sprite in 3d enviornment
[4:30:25] <zocano> So Doom
[4:30:32] <enby_shout> yeah sure
[4:30:39] <enby_shout> its fucking pretty

[4:31:26] <Siregulus> I would imagine it's hard on controller without Simple mode
[4:31:26] <enby_shout> did eggman just moo
[4:31:29] <crimsonsaens> It looks really easy though
[4:31:32] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> also cant chuckle

[4:56:39] <DaKnightWarrior> bye kid lytSUP
[4:56:47] <%Ipsenscastle> what a complete goblin of a person
[4:56:51] <arkv01> man you'd think after a decade of SBFP we'd have filtered out people like that
[4:56:53] <dukenux> Segata was the progenitor of "Big Dick Energy"
[4:56:54] <+Estuko> [shitkid slain]
[4:56:55] <@Menitta> Man...Sonic Adventure was my childhood...
[4:56:56] <thewoolieholeofdavidcage> woolie should do sonic mania vs chat one day. it be a blast
[4:57:08] <+zaibatsu_member_333> That one Office lady who scream out his name still rings in me :SEGATA SAAN SHIROOOOOOOOO
[4:57:28] <+Estuko> @arkv01 unfortunately there's people who are new and just want to spew shit because it doesn't fit their wants. Whch is basic af needs.
[4:57:42] <xXxPS9xXx> Should have gone this route. It looks and plays so well
[4:57:42] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:57:43] <ShakiraAkira> !uptime
[4:57:43] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 57 minutes
[4:57:43] <%Ipsenscastle> God Sonic Mania made me so happy, I never thought we'd see anything like that again
[4:57:46] <SoupBowler> 3D game development can be a mess, especially back in the infancy of it
[4:57:51] <neVan0> LUL
[4:57:56] <%SirGO0SE> i reported him for being 12 :)
[4:57:59] <+canabananilism> Sonic is at his best when he is FUCKING MUTE
[4:58:04] <%Ipsenscastle> Haha that was a weirdly accurate impression
[4:58:05] <@Menitta> Watch out! You're Gonna Crash! AAAH! woolieOMG
[4:58:19] <arkv01> ok now I kinda feel bad, maybe that guy was actually in primary school
[4:58:21] <Dova573> Screw you Mario 64 aged like fine wine Kappa
[4:58:36] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> There's a reason why Link never says words
[4:58:37] <%Ipsenscastle> @arkv01 did you see his language? I hope not
[4:58:37] <D00D64> Sonic was never mute for any reason other than limitations. look at SegaSonic and Sonic CD, he has a VA that still gets used for games to this day
[4:58:37] <SoupBowler> I love mario 64 but damn Bowser looks ugly in that
[4:58:54] <rubbishbinge> Don't you mean EX TROOPERS?
[4:58:56] <%derap41> There was they called ut bubsy
[4:58:57] <rubbishbinge> ;)
[4:59:00] <@Menitta> See Mario 64 is a well designed game but the environments are god awful nowadays
[4:59:05] <%jiggy_snipe> cuz making Link noises is better
[4:59:06] <+zaibatsu_member_333> THIS MAN PREFERS kIRBY
[4:59:07] <arkv01> its time time to sunset mario
[4:59:10] <turbofolk> An art style never ages over the realistic style
[4:59:25] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> Hey man, Hybrid Heaven is an N64 game
[4:59:40] <arkv01> usher in a new dawn of sonic games unhindered by the lawsuits
[4:59:46] <rubbishbinge> Dobutsu no Mori still looks ok
[4:59:48] <SoupBowler> Unless those sprites were of pre rendered models, then things get a bit weird on "aging"
[4:59:48] <%Ipsenscastle> Paper Mario took a good whack at what you're talking about
[4:59:50] <Hammatime8> Mario Kart 64's got the sprites, for whatever that's worth
[5:00:07] <arkv01> ohhhh yeah I could use a zelda game like this
[5:00:07] <%jiggy_snipe> I mean the 3d Nintendo games were good so it's fine
[5:00:08] <+lojack69> that would look like garbage

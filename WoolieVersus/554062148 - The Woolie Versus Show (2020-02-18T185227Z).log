[0:24:42] <yeildingthought> The podcast is inserting itself into history @ralphfromdk LUL
[0:24:44] <+LtSergei> turns out some other stuff happened in 1918 that takes precedence
[0:24:45] <1matheuw> america trying to hide black history? never before seen my folks
[0:24:45] <zamzoph> @WoolieVersus but now we'll know and we're better for it
[0:24:49] <%DatAsuna> american schools are pushing "actually it was the war f northern aggression"
[0:24:49] <%RioGascar> i think thats just TOO dark
[0:24:50] <ThatGuyThere03> I really miss 15 minutes ago
[0:24:50] <Hawkbone_> We got a lot of info to cover, we can't touch on it all, to be fair
[0:24:53] <Scova_> omega fucked LUL
[0:24:53] <Personified134> American schools get plenty of that stuff, that *particular* one just doesn't come up specifically

[0:25:01] <+tearknack> @WoolieVersus you think murican schools teach anything about black history? lol
[0:25:02] <%WhackyChiraqi> @WoolieVersus The extent of black history we learn about in American schools is such: Who MLK is, who Rosa Parks is, what cotton is, how cotton is picked, things cotton can be used for ...
[0:25:03] <ssgsorrels> woolz, slavery ended in 1800s
[0:25:04] <rearedlogarithm> I didn’t find out about Tulsa until my late twenties.

[0:30:45] <+Zagreus> Deoderant, so you don't stink up the bus
[0:30:49] <%gatorafan> It could have been worse, like Cookies
[0:30:53] <+mighty_max_t> Oh no
[0:30:56] <%gunsrlove> hmmm, Twitch made me a 1month subscriber somehow
[0:30:57] <draugrix> that title was the equivalent of Adolf Hitler and the big bakesale

[0:31:07] <+NotHereToStream> don't worry, we'll wash away these feelings by killing demons

[0:36:21] <turbofolk> I learned about emmet till today, my boy was trying to up his game and he got blasted
[0:36:23] <+GodsAndHumans> Last time I played DOOM 2016 the screen was about the 6.66 update lmao
[0:36:24] <%WhackyChiraqi> Is this a Mobile Game??
[0:36:24] <AnthroMetal> it used to be so simple
[0:36:28] <Ner234> TrumpetSkele
[0:36:28] <%realm_forge> There used to be some crazy shit. Arcade mode was awesome
[0:36:31] <Ashenik1> Doot doot doooouoot dooot doot
[0:36:34] <AnthroMetal> god i hate tiles for menus
[0:36:59] <+Javaa01> Arcade Mode is still in the game, it's just under the menu once you load your save
[0:37:04] <zamzoph> Who wins: DOOD Eteete or MOOM Lanrrnal
[0:37:05] <cheesedburgers> This looks like a digital store not a menu
[0:37:10] <Ashenik1> @WoolieVersus youhave to see the video on r/Doom just type doot

[0:37:23] <%SilverInferno3> Seriously though, Arcade Mode is just the game with a style meter and its the best
[0:37:25] <+Javaa01> Snapmap is kind of a lame level editor

[0:42:38] <awalr> medium male
[0:42:46] <%gatorafan> you did this :)
[0:42:50] <%SilverInferno3> Ugh Necropolis
[0:42:51] <%mh9s> large lad
[0:42:52] <+NotHereToStream> rip and tear
[0:43:03] <%SilverInferno3> Finding the last secret here was impossible for me
[0:43:06] <+GodsAndHumans> Can you believe the slayer killed that with just his bare hands?
[0:43:12] <%SilverInferno3> Fun level tho
[0:43:35] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Hell Keyblade
[0:43:35] <%Javaa01> The crucible is a neat looking Mcguffin
[0:43:42] <pshuuu> berutoto
[0:43:47] <%GeneralSCPatton> Everything was killed
[0:43:54] <xxHungryxx> Game map is skeleton. Very nice
[0:43:57] <+hoenhime344> why is the gun off to the right?
[0:44:08] <%SilverInferno3> @Enemy_In_Disguise Shhhhhh
[0:44:15] <%SilverInferno3> UGH
[0:44:30] <rearedlogarithm> That’s the bossest of fountains.
[0:44:31] <%SilverInferno3> That challenge
[0:44:36] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Have fun with that
[0:44:40] <+karldeck> How many levels until Woolie is done?
[0:44:41] <+chiluzza> the first one is actually the easiest
[0:44:53] <+hoenhime344> gun not being centered is killing me lmao
[0:44:55] <+Neoepochx> You can only finish it off with a charged pistol shot though
[0:44:58] <siamzero94> @karldeck with this is should be 3
[0:44:59] <fist_wizard_jay> Like, two or three levels left?
[0:45:03] <%Javaa01> This map is kind of a soft reference to Tricks and Traps from Doom 2
[0:45:13] <xxHungryxx> I wonder if Doomguy pays his taxes
[0:45:15] <%SilverInferno3> Unless you're like me and had that rune equipped that changed how stagger works and fucks you
[0:45:22] <+karldeck> @siamzero94 Hopefully Woolie do another 8 hour stream if needed
[0:45:33] <doomslayerdt> Turn up the FOV if you wanna get high
[0:45:33] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1229464161366794241?s=19
[0:45:52] <fist_wizard_jay> I cant wait to see Woolie and Reggie being welcomed into the Band again
[0:45:52] <@Solidus_113> RIP AND TEAR
[0:45:57] <+Neoepochx> @silverinferno3 Yeah, the one where it staggers earlier will cause problems. you need the one that makes staggers longer, so you have time to charge the pistol
[0:45:58] <@Solidus_113> STARTING STRONG
[0:46:03] <siamzero94> @karldeck oh next level is more straightfoward than this, so it should be possible today
[0:46:10] <Belutima> chat, what difficulty is woolie playing on?
[0:46:15] <+xx123manxx> normal
[0:46:17] <awalr> hurt me plenty

[0:47:39] <+chiluzza> thats not the right one
[0:47:41] <%SilverInferno3> @WoolieVersus Enemies recover health after they recover from a stagger state

[0:56:59] <+McSoliace> is the music low for anyone else?
[0:57:01] <%Irridium> should look at what's hanging in that blue skull room
[0:57:09] <1matheuw> @McSoliace kinda
[0:57:10] <%jepupu> I don't remember this being so easy. Is there a difference between the PC and console versions?
[0:57:15] <%jepupu> Or maybe I just sucked
[0:57:23] <%RioGascar> Its woolies difficulty level too
[0:57:23] <%Ashenik1> Woolie could you turn the gamemusic/audio a little bit higher?
[0:57:40] <%SilverInferno3> @jepupu He's on normal, maybe you remember something higher
[0:57:41] <Hawkbone_> Specifically on hell knights
[0:57:59] <%jepupu> I think I might've got one above normal now that I think about it
[0:58:06] <%Javaa01> Back to the hub for now
[0:58:15] <@Solidus_113> Woolie want blue
[0:58:19] <@Solidus_113> not yellow
[0:58:25] <%Javaa01> The blue IS a very nice shade
[0:58:26] <Vyneci> You don't remember Indivisible, Reggie?
[0:58:29] <%Taglog7> Lemme hit it

[0:58:58] <%DensityD> psaGoblin
[0:59:18] <%gatorafan> updating podcast titles
[0:59:19] <fist_wizard_jay> Woolie acquired: Mind Goblins
[0:59:23] <1matheuw> thats just normal reggie
[0:59:33] <%realm_forge> It’s like those videos where someone is power washing their driveway and it’s cathartic as hell
[0:59:38] <%Solidnick18> My god reggie i know what you mean
[0:59:38] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:59:43] <stranger59> the demons never wash their hands
[0:59:47] <s1rcuit> @WoolieVersus Reggie I worked in a hospital, you're good with the hand washing
[0:59:49] <%DensityD> I like big stone clockwork in hell
[0:59:50] <ihateyouo> ICON
[0:59:53] <%DensityD> and I cannot lie
[0:59:54] <turbofolk> Thats just basic fuck manners
[0:59:54] <xxHungryxx> ppl wash their hands?
[0:59:58] <Belutima> sub human, the song woopsThink
[1:00:00] <%ozzrabbit> Why did that question make me think of Pat’s bed making habits?
[1:00:03] <doomslayerdt> Fun Fact: Walmart is full of dudes who dont wash their hands from rancid poops
[1:00:03] <rsg220> Hey aren't you going to wash your hands? No....because I'm evil
[1:00:08] <@Solidus_113> the UI is quaking in fear
[1:00:08] <%Solidnick18> the sound of guitars Kreygasm
[1:00:09] <@Commando_Joe> If I go out to eat with people and they get like...side dishes and they don't touch them I force myself to eat them. Like when you get a side of fruit with breakfast. coxFeedMe
[1:00:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> Cheer500 The Doomslayer has Seraphim blessings for strength and speed, demon race-traitor Praetor Suit, and unrelenting human rage which might explain the healing from Glory Kills. He's got the best of all worlds.
[1:00:22] <presque> Will we get some BFG action ?
[1:00:46] <@Squdnate> Sentinels!
[1:00:47] <CoffeeSlice> YEYEYE

[1:00:54] <+Shikari21> he just noticed LUL
[1:00:55] <@Solidus_113> you've fought them before
[1:00:56] <BallerSwagBro9k> You saw them last time Woolz
[1:00:57] <trfurkanrey18> thats a Specter
[1:00:59] <%Javaa01> Read about em, there's stuff on them in the Codex
[1:01:00] <%RioGascar> @commando_joe What about leftovers for them heat up at home you monster > : (
[1:01:00] <fist_wizard_jay> literal ankle break from the Pinky’s
[1:01:03] <xxHungryxx> pfp. i could kill demons too if i felt like it
[1:01:09] <Hawkbone_> @GeneralSCPatton The health from glory kills is because the praetor suit can absorb argent energy and give it to the Slayer.
[1:01:10] <Vyneci> You already killed a bunch of them, you just didn't notice LUL
[1:01:12] <%SilverInferno3> They're invisible in his memories too
[1:01:13] <%Haarute> i think he killed them so hard last time he didn't even realize their gimmick.
[1:01:15] <siamzero94> two barons
[1:01:15] <+Shikari21> you fought some last session lol
[1:01:16] <Enemy_In_Disguise> I always forget about grenades in this
[1:01:21] <Hawkbone_> Its why there's little red circles on his chest and hands
[1:01:23] <%realm_forge> It’s never the big boys that get ya it’s always that one imp with that lucky ass fireball
[1:01:27] <DrkJP520> You've been fighting those invisible enemies for hours, dude
[1:01:29] <%JetpackMcQuack> Be nice, they're kinda hard to spot :)

[1:02:05] <%Ashenik1> @DrkJP520 they are the WORST at the highest difficulty
[1:02:07] <@Squdnate> I mixed Sentinels with Spectres
[1:02:12] <@Squdnate> I AM THE WORST DOOM FAN
[1:02:19] <%valriot> Just ran in circles like 4 times LUL
[1:02:21] <%GeneralSCPatton> @hawkbone_ But the lore talks about him alone being able to draw strength from his fallen foes, before the armor is created.

[1:06:48] <+bubbli97> will today be the finale?
[1:06:49] <fist_wizard_jay> Teal-Guy stole Reggie’s soul
[1:07:01] <+xx123manxx> not canon
[1:07:01] <trfurkanrey18> @xdeathknightx isnt it implied very heavily he is the same guy from the classic doom s ?
[1:07:02] <%GeneralSCPatton> I NEED MORE POWER
[1:07:03] <Enemy_In_Disguise> @squdnate I wish
[1:07:04] <awalr> barfing into the void
[1:07:04] <hassanico2> @bubbli97 according to schedule seems like it
[1:07:05] <%Solidnick18> but they are demons
[1:07:06] <%Haarute> can you turn up the difficulty mid game?
[1:07:08] <%DensityD> that's why people do doom2016 challenge runs
[1:07:10] <Zebroneath> Is Woolie secretly a demon sympathizer?

[1:07:49] <$GoogleyGareth> Charged burst gets a bad rap

[1:08:33] <$GoogleyGareth> I missed it on my first run, but going back to it it's actually pretty great.
[1:08:34] <Enemy_In_Disguise> It’s John Romero

[1:08:43] <%Ashenik1> @DesertPenguin kindda
[1:08:45] <xdeathknightx> @trfurkanrey18 Tim Willits made it clear that wasn't canon anymore. He had a huge fight with Tom Hall and John Romero over it
[1:08:46] <siamzero94> my money's on manc
[1:08:54] <%Irridium> after the fight
[1:08:55] <hassanico2> Infighting was a huge mechanic in Doom 1 and 2, especially in coop

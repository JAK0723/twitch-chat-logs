[0:02:06] <Nina96> once on stage at a con i think
[0:02:10] <ghostravens> Woolie VS Fiasco. Make it happen
[0:02:16] <themightyquinn3000> Hi everyone
[0:02:20] <TomFrank> SourPls this slaps
[0:02:26] <%Dash_rendar89> BOARD GAME SHIT!!!!!!
[0:02:27] <arikk42> it's 3 AM Woolz can you upload this on youtube ?
[0:02:47] <$theKittenhugs> Tablelords goes on the channel eventually
[0:02:48] <Nina96> eventually
[0:03:25] <Superdandy96> I haven’t checked Twitter yet, did Woolie mention what the game(or games) tonight?
[0:03:32] <clamlamity> Nopes.
[0:03:37] <clamlamity> Not that i've seen anyway
[0:03:41] <arkv01> oh yeeeeah that always makes me shiver
[0:04:04] <%ChoculaUltra> oooo lets all guess
[0:04:08] <$SilverRoddo> Does Woolz accept fan arts?
[0:04:09] <%ChoculaUltra> Dark Souls boardgame?
[0:04:21] <clamlamity> Settlers of Catan.
[0:04:21] <$theKittenhugs> When is ProZD going to guest star on Tablelords
[0:04:22] <%Pigg1yJuffs> Quick question, does anyone here think that Woolie should play some BoI: Four Souls for a Tablelords? Because I know he would go nuts with the shenanigans in that game. Here's hoping you see this @woolieversus.
[0:04:22] <ghostravens> i feel he'll play betrayal at house on the hill tonight
[0:04:31] <arikk42> 51 pick ups the board game
[0:04:32] <Superdandy96> @silverroddo I think so, usually if you tweet it to him... I think.
[0:04:41] <ghostravens> i want them to play cosmic encounter eventually
[0:04:48] <Nina96> some of these fan arts seem new but iam prob wrong
[0:04:57] <Superdandy96> I HOPE they play Secret Hitler
[0:05:05] <$SilverRoddo> Ah, excellent, thank you.
[0:05:05] <arikk42> Devil May Cry Monopoly ?
[0:05:06] <Nina96> one day
[0:05:28] <ghostravens> considering what happened last tabelords, someone would absolutely die if they played secret hitler tonight
[0:05:29] <%ChoculaUltra> I'd love to see Pat and Paige guest star on a tablelords session one of these weekends

[0:19:23] <0rond> I gotta say, these last 2 WWFIO made me a fan of punch mom for real
[0:19:23] <%ChoculaUltra> did KoF/Fatal Fury start the custom intro? I think the earliest one I can remember is Terry growling out "GEEEEESE" if he's ever up against Geese since like FF2?
[0:19:26] <%RioGascar> Ken and terrys intro is fucking awesome
[0:19:30] <%RioGascar> Even tho its short
[0:19:48] <Superdandy96> Damn it Spidey, get back to protecting New York, Shocker Robbed another bank!

[0:25:32] <Hammatime8> I thought that's what you guys already did as content creators? Kappa
[0:25:41] <RaklarLS> you make a language as it goes along
[0:25:42] <ghostravens> so this game was made by hideo kojima?
[0:25:44] <%The_Timo> Oooo, If you like this you'll enjoy microscope, which is a less structured type of this game

[0:27:49] <RaklarLS> @Superdandy96 havent played dnd, but playing other RPGs, players that only care about stats and getting to the goal do not want to engage with the DM and put themselves through a story, with conflict and resolution; they just want to win which is not the point

[0:53:12] <foreverN2dust> @Mothman742 we're learning it ourselves
[0:53:12] <worldbrand> Dialect seems to be a game about worldbuilding, roleplaying, and the emphasis is on how languages die but we havent gotten there yet
[0:53:14] <+CoronetChris> The Spice must flooow!
[0:53:25] <+PapaGravestone> ooh cool
[0:53:27] <+steelmorrigan> this gonna be along ass game
[0:53:37] <ghostravens> He Who Controls The Spice, Controls The Universe
[0:53:37] <MildConviction> they said this'll likely last the whole session, so a 3-4 hour game.
[0:53:40] <+PapaGravestone> wonder if theyll ever play microscope

[0:55:00] <+PapaGravestone> @the_timo dont think many know about microscope for the comparison lol
[0:55:02] <worldbrand> they havent started yet but minh is definitely winning by at least 2
[0:55:16] <%The_Timo> This is just similar to methods of generating stories and worlds for some DMs lol
[0:55:33] <Mothman742> wow chat u guys werent helpful at all! its almost like u all havent ever played this game Kappa
[0:55:49] <%RioGascar> but its a group effort rather than DM doing it fully to build the start of the world
[0:55:56] <Xx_JAG_xX> yo, what's this game called?
[0:56:01] <+steelmorrigan> Dialect
[0:56:03] <Mothman742> dialect
[0:56:07] <ghostravens> the spice from dune but it's sugar instead
[0:56:10] <Xx_JAG_xX> thanks homies
[0:56:12] <+buttdirt> first you get the sugar, then you get the power, then you get the women
[0:56:22] <%RioGascar> also is this island ISOLATED
[0:56:22] <MildConviction> so it's cocaine
[0:56:24] <%The_Timo> Feels like could save a lot of people's time if he just put it in the title haha but people would still ask
[0:56:25] <+akira_chong> So what's this game called?
[0:56:29] <+PapaGravestone> but you can get sugar from the women tho
[0:56:32] <+fatcrab> Dont know whats going on but seems cool
[0:56:35] <+YabbaTroll> sugar, aw honey honey
[0:56:40] <%RioGascar> it feels like it would be a barter economy
[0:56:53] <%RioGascar> money happens when other countries get involved
[0:57:15] <%RioGascar> or banks begin to pop up
[0:57:17] <Mothman742> yo a mod should make a command for when people ask wat game they're playing
[0:57:20] <smartiger117> Seize the means of sugar production comrades
[0:57:21] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:57:39] <%RioGascar> people would still ask what game it is
[0:57:45] <+akira_chong> !schedule
[0:57:45] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1219688583491092483?s=19
[0:58:08] <+akira_chong> Oh, even in the schedule it just says "Tablelords."
[0:58:11] <KitsuneManami> @WoolieVersus Did you see the Samurai Shodown DLC?
[0:58:21] <Arblaster_> 天
[0:58:25] <Mattatat_tat> forreal tho what are they playing

[0:58:30] <+PapaGravestone> man i havent eaten an orange in forever. feels right.
[0:58:34] <%RioGascar> stockpiling sugar when isolated SOUNDS WORTHLESS

[0:59:07] <zanderrage> then stop with sugar
[0:59:12] <%Dash_rendar89> I think Robots is the way to go
[0:59:15] <MayorRev> wait civilization is NOT a board game?

[1:05:21] <%RioGascar> radiation is the gift that never stops giving
[1:05:33] <%RioGascar> damn Half-Life on nuclear plutonium
[1:05:40] <@akuda_bar> There's a really great one from horizon zero dawn where the robots are basically just there to keep the planet warm until the evil AI dies of old age
[1:05:41] <+MisterCrimson> planetary recycling

[1:06:24] <$Walopoh> Climate Change RPG is what we live in irl LUL
[1:06:31] <%RioGascar> @WoolieVersus i propose atmoshphere collapsed and the landscape is a solar irradiated hellscape. robots are built to move it to isolation zones to somewhat make the planet habitable
[1:06:34] <%The_Timo> White people
[1:06:39] <foreverN2dust> preserving the last rements of genetic material left of humans
[1:06:43] <ghostravens> Solar Flare?
[1:06:48] <%RioGascar> ohhhhhhhhhh i like that forever
[1:06:50] <Mothman742> @akuda_bar how the fuck would an AI die of old age? Sounds wack
[1:06:52] <+MisterCrimson> Gamma ray burst

[1:07:19] <%The_Timo> Ooo Viral cleanup
[1:07:21] <@akuda_bar> @Mothman742 runs on biomatter, all the biomatter on earth is consumed robots come back once the robot runs out of biomatter and put the biomatter back
[1:07:25] <harpsichord_uiy> What are those lamps they're using
[1:07:25] <foreverN2dust> @RioGascar read the manga oneshot Hotel, it's beautiful
[1:07:42] <trianglehat> can't be patched
[1:07:48] <$theKittenhugs> Death Stranding robots
[1:07:50] <worldbrand> Turned people into salt
[1:07:50] <%RioGascar> oh wait fuck all that

[1:07:55] <+CoronetChris> Death Stranding
[1:07:59] <Mothman742> @akuda_bar well that kinda makes more sense
[1:08:04] <foreverN2dust> everybody poops
[1:08:12] <$theKittenhugs> no fuck you i don't poop
[1:08:15] <$theKittenhugs> I don't!!!! noooo
[1:08:16] <+BoboDaHobo> so far this game has just been woolie and steph talking while Reggie and Minh look back and forth like it's a tennis match
[1:08:20] <gsoto83> And they take any chance as any chance
[1:08:37] <Hellarussian> sounds like the Bubonic Plague
[1:08:55] <$Walopoh> The Mongols literally catapulted Bubonic-infected corpses into a sieged city, boats sailed in fear to Europe. And this began the Black Plague
[1:08:56] <$theKittenhugs> Reggie big on corpse disposal robot's job security
[1:08:59] <worldbrand> I had to step away, did they ditch the slavery thing?
[1:09:04] <@akuda_bar> that's so metal
[1:09:05] <+steelmorrigan> yes
[1:09:07] <Mothman742> @bobodahobo they look like two kids caught between their parents discussing LUL
[1:09:14] <worldbrand> gotcha
[1:09:16] <+Dr_Mooose> "but I'm still alive"
[1:09:18] <+BubbaRands> Can the robots wear plague masks?
[1:09:22] <gsoto83> Reggie is Big Corpse disposal lobby
[1:09:22] <+SlappyMeats> they bury the dead, and in order to do a better job, they must make more dead :D
[1:09:22] <+steelmorrigan> The Slave thing asked too manty borad quetsions
[1:09:24] <Prevot> they traded bio slavery for robo slavery
[1:09:30] <Azathotic> Sun O))))?
[1:09:30] <foreverN2dust> They will know us by the trail of dead...
[1:09:31] <Fujiwara_92> LUL
[1:09:35] <%The_Timo> must have been catastrophic. How long will this clean up take?
[1:09:41] <Arblaster_> Berry?
[1:09:45] <foreverN2dust> that's the bad woolie is thinking of, I'm pretty sure
[1:09:48] <+Dr_Mooose> LUL
[1:09:49] <Hellarussian> mind games
[1:09:49] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @gsoto83
[1:09:50] <foreverN2dust> band*
[1:09:51] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> LUL LUL LUL
[1:09:54] <%RioGascar> i say we go with 50% of the planet died
[1:10:01] <%RioGascar> animals, humans etc
[1:10:16] <Fujiwara_92> burry
[1:10:18] <%The_Timo> "ALMOST" bilingual apparently lol
[1:10:18] <gsoto83> tHAT DOESN"T ME SHES AN ENGLISH MAJOR!
[1:10:18] <$Walopoh> brry
[1:10:27] <foreverN2dust> called it
[1:10:29] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Sounds metal
[1:10:33] <Hellarussian> metal as fuck
[1:10:35] <+Dr_Mooose> that's metal
[1:10:37] <$Walopoh> kewl
[1:10:38] <gsoto83> Oh, You will know us by the trail of the dead, thats a good band
[1:10:40] <+BubbaRands> ok that is fuckin sick as fuck
[1:10:43] <Azathotic> Shockingly not a metal band though FeelsSadMan
[1:10:54] <%The_Timo> Urge to hump things
[1:10:57] <gsoto83> Surprise, they are not metal
[1:10:59] <%Irridium> big orgies
[1:11:01] <%RioGascar> idea: actual burial
[1:11:06] <%RioGascar> and cerimony
[1:11:07] <+Emperor_Bad> reverance for the dead
[1:11:08] <Prevot> tombstones
[1:11:08] <worldbrand> You paint your robot fingernails
[1:11:11] <%CappuccinoGuil> You start wearing gothic lolita dresses
[1:11:19] <gsoto83> ^^^^
[1:11:21] <+SlappyMeats> Is this the setup of the game, or is this the game?
[1:11:29] <Superdandy96> Robots understand the need to show off their butts?
[1:11:29] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:11:34] <Mothman742> Yes
[1:11:35] <%The_Timo> Maybe the humans were fairly religious so each burial has to be done in a full funeral
[1:11:38] <+MisterCrimson> So...we're just building Nier
[1:11:46] <Sedrelic> we are...vr
[1:11:50] <Prevot> they show humanity by wanting to **** 2B
[1:11:51] <%RioGascar> a robot would eventually begin to see the corpses as something else
[1:11:52] <+PenmanLupine> why was I programmed to feel pain?!
[1:11:57] <worldbrand> You learned how to raise the dead
[1:11:57] <%CappuccinoGuil> "We have our job, but what if we were also insanely attractive?"
[1:12:06] <JoeyStar> what game is this?
[1:12:08] <Mothman742> @prevot u would too
[1:12:08] <gusdabus91> isn't there an anime like this?
[1:12:11] <foreverN2dust> @SlappyMeats setup most likely, we are all learning how this goes right now
[1:12:26] <10deez> @JoeyStar Upper right corner
[1:12:31] <Sedrelic> isnt that just normal megaman
[1:12:32] <%CappuccinoGuil> Grow fingers?
[1:12:33] <$theKittenhugs> Give us sexy corpse disposal robots
[1:12:34] <ItYaboiDrew> what they playing?
[1:12:35] <%The_Timo> Oh you mean like an AI? LOL
[1:12:37] <%RioGascar> the ability to gain empathy
[1:12:39] <$theKittenhugs> give the people what they want
[1:12:41] <+desfore> I just showed up, is he explaining Megaman?
[1:12:42] <+steelmorrigan> Dialect
[1:12:43] <10deez> @ItYaboiDrew Upper right corner
[1:12:43] <%CappuccinoGuil> @ItYaboiDrew Dialect
[1:12:51] <ItYaboiDrew> oh ok thanks
[1:12:54] <%RioGascar> burying corpses IS A BRUTAL FUCKIGN job
[1:13:02] <JoeyStar> @10deez thanks didn’t notice
[1:13:11] <Lamedhos> Adapt, improvised, overcome
[1:13:12] <%RioGascar> so i think the robot would maybe start empathizing with the corpses they bury
[1:13:20] <%RioGascar> maybe try and learn about their past
[1:13:24] <Sedrelic> 1 emotion: FEAR
[1:13:29] <%The_Timo> Lol just describing A.I.
[1:13:36] <%The_Timo> Curiousity would be more interesting
[1:13:48] <worldbrand> you have the ability to feel +1 and -1
[1:13:52] <%The_Timo> the ability to get distracted
[1:13:58] <Mothman742> All these ideas have been done before haven't they?
[1:14:12] <%RioGascar> i mean the ability to feel empathy is just terminator 2
[1:14:14] <$theKittenhugs> All the robots grow addicted to gacha games
[1:14:18] <%RioGascar> i know now why you cry
[1:14:25] <HijiriBee> Don't mind me, just here to escape the Leroy 7 GF NotLikeThis
[1:14:30] <awzie420> is there no more super best friends?
[1:14:40] <Sedrelic> weed-powered robots
[1:14:41] <$theKittenhugs> where you been for the last year
[1:14:44] <Mothman742> TOO SOON
[1:14:46] <worldbrand> I... no, i got bad news for you
[1:14:51] <worldbrand> check the channel
[1:14:51] <+Dr_Mooose> oh buddy
[1:14:55] <foreverN2dust> @Mothman742 You can say that about anything really, fiction is really broad. It's all about context and execution.

[1:16:10] <+MisterCrimson> developing rudimentary tribalism
[1:16:10] <awzie420> why what happened?? ive been in kuwait serving in the military what happen??

[1:16:25] <+BubbaRands> Now this is just an episode of black mirror
[1:16:40] <%Exiliator> Does it have to serve a purpose?
[1:16:44] <Sedrelic> PrideGive FEAR team
[1:16:50] <+PapaGravestone> matt and pat had a falling out and arent friends anymore @awzie420

[1:18:05] <%RioGascar> sucks but they seem happier
[1:18:24] <Mothman742> When's the anniversary tho?
[1:18:26] <DeltascapeV4> henlo
[1:18:27] <%The_Timo> Humanity was perverted.... but they could not imagine the true perversion of A.I.

[1:19:41] <%The_Timo> Every Robot for whatever reason decided to give themselves devil horns
[1:19:52] <%The_Timo> and pitch forks

[1:20:03] <ghoulspan> man look at the fupa
[1:20:36] <+Arkfyre> Some robots want to bury the humans before they die, to avoid the spread of disease MrDestructoid
[1:20:55] <%The_Timo> Have to replace and trade parts with each other for different daily tasks! Maybe sometimes you get attached to certain parts.
[1:20:56] <atravelbee> FU-pa
[1:21:18] <+PapaGravestone> buttswapping? PogChamp

[1:22:12] <Mothman742> @forevern2dust OK but why shouldn't we put doom in everything
[1:22:53] <foreverN2dust> you aren't wrong, we need to take it further rooH
[1:22:58] <worldbrand> the year is 2142 and they have figured out how to play doom on a pig

[1:24:13] <foreverN2dust> it's not*
[1:24:24] <+akira_chong> @awzie420 Woolie and Pat still do the weekly podcast under the name Castle Super Beast, though.
[1:24:27] <Mothman742> I see some vore "enthusiasts" are in chat.... shotoEww
[1:24:28] <ghostravens> well this got dark
[1:24:52] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Humans being the morons we are, build robots who need to eat humans to survive. Makes sense, we are morons.
[1:25:04] <Sedrelic> i find it funny, but i cant watch it for more than 5 seconds
[1:25:12] <+SlappyMeats> Corpse-powered robots. Yeah, let's just kick up the turbo on that murderbot revolution
[1:25:15] <MildConviction> we're inventing fossil fuels again, but now they still have some meat on them
[1:25:19] <+BubbaRands> If human corpses are fuel what's stopping them from taking out the middle man and just killing people?
[1:25:29] <%The_Timo> Humans aren't on earth anymore
[1:25:32] <+SlappyMeats> Indentured?
[1:25:33] <+Emperor_Bad> raison d'etre?
[1:25:41] <foreverN2dust> we Ergo Proxy now
[1:25:46] <gusdabus91> what about the robot suicide epidemic
[1:25:46] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:25:51] <+PenmanLupine> @BubbaRands I think its assumed that all humans are dead and their corpses litter the earth
[1:26:00] <%The_Timo> That was in the beginning, Humans left earth and had A.I. Clean up whatever was left
[1:26:12] <Sedrelic> why only humans,,, why not eat dogs or something then
[1:26:14] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> @The_Timo I assume we want to go back at some point. Or else, why have the robots dispose of the dead at all.
[1:26:29] <%CappuccinoGuil> But if that's the case, wouldn't they run out of energy in like, 80 years? All humans are dead, hence they are all decomposing fast.
[1:26:29] <foreverN2dust> @The_Timo that sets up the assu... yeah what engwithan said
[1:26:49] <+PenmanLupine> @CappuccinoGuil not unless the earth is super cold now
[1:26:51] <+steelmorrigan> At leats that wasthe asusmtion when the robots ere programmed
[1:27:05] <Hellarussian> now wot
[1:27:05] <%The_Timo> Lol oh for sure, but if we knew the dead would fuel them, we'd know how long it would take them before they're all gone @Engwithan_Elder_God
[1:27:07] <+steelmorrigan> we know the humans are gone
[1:27:10] <+BubbaRands> THat's my question!!!
[1:27:19] <+SlappyMeats> Gosh, what happens when they run out of corpses?
[1:27:22] <Mothman742> Not gonna lie..... IMO this game seems kinda lame
[1:27:23] <%CappuccinoGuil> @PenmanLupine Even so, it'd have to be so cold, no life can live there anymore.
[1:27:28] <+SlappyMeats> HMMM
[1:27:32] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> @The_Timo True. Just wait them out.
[1:27:41] <+PenmanLupine> @CappuccinoGuil which is fine for a world of just machines
[1:27:42] <+steelmorrigan> "This gaeme is about languages and how the ydie"
[1:27:50] <+steelmorrigan> I wonder what will happen :p
[1:27:52] <%Irridium> blurst
[1:27:57] <MaxXtreme23> Which game is this?
[1:27:59] <Hellarussian> cressed
[1:28:04] <+steelmorrigan> Dialect
[1:28:06] <worldbrand> I can definitely see this not being a game for everyboidy
[1:28:07] <+Arkfyre> blursed
[1:28:07] <+BubbaRands> Do the robots resort to making MORE corpses one the eventual humans come back to taking their land?!
[1:28:07] <+SlappyMeats> yo what's on that pizza?
[1:28:26] <+SlappyMeats> 100% guaranteed @BubbaRands
[1:28:33] <Hellarussian> anchovies hopefully
[1:29:21] <Mothman742> But isn't it inhabited by the robots??
[1:29:25] <+Dr_Mooose> green or red earth
[1:29:26] <Superdandy96> Probably ham and pineapple since that’s a Canadian invention
[1:29:26] <%The_Timo> Big Purple fuzz has grown over EVERYTHING
[1:29:28] <ghostravens> nier automata city i imagine
[1:29:38] <+BubbaRands> Lots of overgrowth
[1:29:49] <%Itselguapo> Overgrowth, yup we nier automata
[1:30:04] <worldbrand> rats, rats, we're the rats
[1:30:21] <@Solidus_113> Florida has sunk
[1:30:27] <Mothman742> I'm the big rat who makes all of da rulez
[1:30:28] <Sedrelic> jermaChomp
[1:30:33] <ghostravens> Florida is no more
[1:30:40] <+PenmanLupine> good
[1:30:51] <worldbrand> concrete jungle ft. rat plague
[1:30:58] <ghostravens> ratratratratratratratratrat
[1:31:01] <worldbrand> tokyo jungle but the rats won
[1:31:02] <+BubbaRands> The rats are the masters now
[1:31:03] <Hellarussian> shits all fucked
[1:31:04] <%Itselguapo> I'm the small rat who eats all the grool!
[1:31:04] <+Dr_Mooose> crikRat our time is now crikRat
[1:31:09] <Prevot> the earth stinks
[1:31:12] <%The_Timo> VISUALLY lol
[1:31:13] <Mothman742> Crab rave 🦀 Florida's Gone 🦀
[1:31:13] <+Arkfyre> perhaps there's a giant rat, that make most, if not all of the rules
[1:31:36] <%Itselguapo> Really small rats don't follow the rules
[1:31:52] <worldbrand> did they burn the dead?
[1:32:04] <+CarlosEoM> thats metal
[1:32:07] <Mothman742> No cause the bits eat them
[1:32:14] <Mothman742> Bots
[1:32:19] <+akira_chong> Yeah that's super metal
[1:32:23] <worldbrand> i meant the mongolians lol
[1:32:29] <+akira_chong> yeah
[1:32:30] <+SlappyMeats> it's ok, he made up for it with all of the babies he fucked into existence :)
[1:32:33] <Superdandy96> That and he screwed like a rabbit, there’s a little khan in all of us!
[1:32:33] <Mothman742> Oh LUL
[1:32:44] <ghostravens> ngl, i'm enjoying this worldbuilding process
[1:32:46] <%The_Timo> OOo refining them down into their most basic elements ? lol
[1:32:46] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:32:47] <foreverN2dust> The ring of ice surrounding the flat earth melted so now the oceans are leaking out Kappa
[1:32:49] <+BubbaRands> Human gases LUL
[1:33:22] <Hellarussian> humans got cancelled by bacteria?
[1:33:38] <foreverN2dust> bacteria cancel culture strong
[1:33:40] <Mothman742> #humansareoverparty
[1:34:20] <+nintega010> this is pretty much horizon zero dawn story
[1:34:21] <ghostravens> humans are cancelled. stan the plague
[1:35:11] <Mothman742> So bacteria are just kpop stans? Makes sense
[1:35:20] <Huntercd> Is that Woolie's wife?
[1:35:20] <Sedrelic> how many robots exists? are we talking millions or just hundreds
[1:35:30] <Arblaster_> Did the plague turn everyone into salt by chance? LUL
[1:35:47] <+SlappyMeats> depalpitated
[1:35:48] <@Menitta> I come back and the world is fucked.
[1:35:50] <%Itselguapo> Dilapidated boats
[1:35:54] <Mothman742> @huntercd yes that is punch mom
[1:35:56] <@Menitta> Good job.
[1:36:06] <MildConviction> de-palpatined
[1:36:17] <Sedrelic> japan, or ny
[1:36:19] <+BubbaRands> De-Order66'd
[1:36:20] <MelBrooksKA> @Menitta That's what you get for leaving
[1:36:23] <+Dr_Mooose> heavily populated areas
[1:36:29] <%Itselguapo> Soooo how does this game work?
[1:36:31] <@Menitta> NotLikeThis
[1:36:31] <Prevot> old world
[1:36:38] <Superdandy96> And even when humans kick the bucket, Plague will still exist
[1:36:40] <%The_Timo> Maybe most of NA is what actually evacuated
[1:36:43] <kuningaz45> so what the fuck game are they playing
[1:36:53] <+steelmorrigan> Dialect
[1:36:58] <%RioGascar> it would be planetart evac
[1:37:06] <Mothman742> @menitta u just missed the guy who was selling ur feet pics for cheep Kappa
[1:37:21] <@Menitta> wait MY feet pics?!
[1:37:31] <@Solidus_113> Coronavirus
[1:37:32] <Sedrelic> this is some dnd setup time

[1:37:34] <Prevot> man there's gonna be A LOT of corpses in china
[1:37:41] <worldbrand> genghisbots
[1:37:42] <foreverN2dust> Born to die / world is a fuck / Kill Em All 1989 / I am trash man / 410,757,864,530 dead humans
[1:37:51] <+SlappyMeats> ah, continuing the Kahn tradition
[1:38:02] <worldbrand> oh okay interesting
[1:38:14] <shubachi> wait what are they playing?

[1:38:56] <@Menitta> 410 billion
[1:39:00] <AmericanaRed> apatBougie A BILLION PATRONS
[1:39:05] <worldbrand> What about #The1300VoreRobots
[1:39:09] <Mothman742> All GAZILLION HUMANS DEAD
[1:39:10] <%RioGascar> arent we at like 7 billion people on earth currently
[1:39:21] <MelBrooksKA> ye
[1:39:23] <Alzero83> What is this game?
[1:39:29] <Alzero83> I came in without context
[1:39:35] <MildConviction> 100,000 robots looking for human corpses to use as fuel PogChamp
[1:39:42] <%RioGascar> the population metrics would probably ge thrown off
[1:39:43] <worldbrand> This game is supposed to be a roleplaying game about worldbuilding, particularly about languages and how they die
[1:39:45] <+steelmorrigan> dialect : a game about lanaguage and how it dies
[1:39:46] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Tibet might be more central.
[1:39:57] <AmericanaRed> OWLteamkill
[1:39:57] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1219688583491092483?s=19
[1:39:59] <Mothman742> @alzero83 they playing magic the gathering Kappa
[1:40:03] <worldbrand> but so far we've got a race of robots that clean up bodies and language has not come into the picture yet
[1:40:05] <@Menitta> oh boy
[1:40:16] <Prevot> topical
[1:40:17] <%Lion_kun> china is always ground zero for these things
[1:40:19] <neet98> chinese men are walking bomb
[1:40:20] <Hellarussian> Plague Inc sales increase by 1000%
[1:40:20] <%RioGascar> not so much concendice as logical
[1:40:25] <%Lion_kun> corona, sars, the world war z zombie plague
[1:40:30] <ghostravens> i mean, we're in the 20's. we were due a plague
[1:40:34] <+BubbaRands> China is patient 0
[1:40:37] <%RioGascar> chinas air quality is awful, the population is density is awful
[1:40:38] <Sedrelic> kill it
[1:40:44] <@Menitta> I for one am excited to live in Raccoon City
[1:40:50] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Scrapped for parts.
[1:40:55] <Sedrelic> take his parts, get huge
[1:40:57] <MildConviction> BREAKING: Tribe of living, healthy humans found in Madagascar
[1:40:58] <neet98> we gonna nuke china?

[1:41:14] <Lamedhos> BIG Corpse Energy
[1:41:23] <+BubbaRands> What was the question again?
[1:41:24] <neet98> with the Raccoon city comparison
[1:41:24] <%RioGascar> also from what i read china isnt super hygenic
[1:41:28] <+Arkfyre> give your spare e-tanks to the robots who reapirs you
[1:41:29] <+Kiaayo> @MildConviction i got that reference
[1:41:29] <Superdandy96> And if recent videos on reddit are true, China ain’t helping themselves in what they’re eating too
[1:41:34] <%RioGascar> which just breeds diseases
[1:41:44] <Hellarussian> send out Wall-e
[1:41:49] <cyberblueneon> yeah, i just saw a video where a chinese guy drinks a bottle full of live baby snakes
[1:41:54] <neet98> the corona outbreak was because they eat bat
[1:41:59] <%Dash_rendar89> Every time you malfunction, You lose a piece of yourself (limited amounts)
[1:42:09] <+steelmorrigan> Minh making this waaaaaay too complicated
[1:42:13] <Sedrelic> vore the robot for more corpse fuel
[1:42:25] <+DrPoxx> whats the game? Sorry I am late
[1:42:29] <@Menitta> Dialect.
[1:42:34] <@Menitta> Game title top right corner
[1:42:34] <Bailey__gaming> what game is this?
[1:42:41] <+DrPoxx> Co-op?
[1:42:43] <trianglehat> language = dead
[1:42:44] <+steelmorrigan> yes
[1:42:48] <worldbrand> it is about roleplaying and worldbuilding and languages and how they die
[1:42:51] <AmericanaRed> robot juice
[1:42:52] <Bailey__gaming> oh yeah derp
[1:42:52] <Mothman742> THEY ARE PLAYING DIALECT
[1:43:06] <Sedrelic> benevolence is an emotion, not emotion
[1:43:06] <AmericanaRed> MrDestructoid SHARE THE ROBOT JUICE
[1:43:08] <Hellarussian> right, but what game is this?
[1:43:11] <worldbrand> they havent really gotten to the language bit yet though
[1:43:16] <neet98> oh the death stranding scenario
[1:43:20] <yficaptions> the game shows at the top right corner
[1:43:23] <worldbrand> Oh this is uno 3, the sequel to uno 2 (not related to uno though)
[1:43:29] <SumKnowBuddy> didnt they discuss how they shoudlnt make different classes earlier?
[1:43:32] <AmericanaRed> FEMALE ONLY ROBOTS
[1:43:40] <%RioGascar> they restarted
[1:43:50] <%RioGascar> and did robots instead of slave uprising
[1:43:54] <Bailey__gaming> @woolieversus are you taking or wanting suggestions for boardgames?

[1:44:01] <%JetpackMcQuack> Roger roger
[1:44:13] <neet98> you know woolie wanted to talk about slave uprising
[1:44:25] <%RioGascar> it was too broad questions

[1:45:20] <Lamedhos> Robo delivery
[1:45:22] <+steelmorrigan> Minh making it all about Capitalism
[1:45:25] <+SlappyMeats> simply a programmed directive
[1:45:32] <RC_S3kshun8> Yeah Machines would be very binary. Is the benefit to rescue more advantageous than the fuel expended? etc
[1:45:36] <neet98> death stranding
[1:45:36] <+steelmorrigan> In a society that wouldn;t have it.
[1:45:39] <%RioGascar> a robot would weigh the pros and cons
[1:45:44] <Mothman742> Whoever reads this has smol op energy Kappa
[1:45:45] <%RioGascar> and then decide if its worth it
[1:45:51] <+steelmorrigan> Central decides
[1:46:19] <%RioGascar> calculate the risks and if they outweigh the benefits its good to do

[2:19:45] <%The_Timo> End of the story "Humans come back and hit the off switch and dust their hands off, fade to black."
[2:19:46] <%CappuccinoGuil> Reggie is going to have an eyepatch that conceals his secret power and his eyes will be red, CALLING IT
[2:19:49] <gsoto83> Reggie seems like he would have given himself an Admin backdoor console

[2:25:09] <foreverN2dust> I'm not sure how I feel about technical rulesets being prosed up.
[2:25:15] <%RioGascar> ....to me feels like its the classic issue of designed with the designer in mind, but not the user
[2:26:17] <BurdRightsActivist> what's next? PogChamp
[2:26:18] <+RioGascar> ??????
[2:26:18] <worldbrand> Oh this game was made for me

[2:27:01] <gsoto83> Burbage
[2:27:01] <%The_Timo> well I mean screw language, you're robots, just interface, 1s and 0s lol
[2:27:03] <%RioGascar> feels like this is created with designers and not users in mind
[2:27:04] <%Lion_kun> THE VOCAL PARASITES
[2:27:12] <Sedrelic> dnd
[2:27:24] <%wydamn> Kikon...go
[2:27:47] <Sedrelic> and ALL of the character based tabletops
[2:27:51] <gsoto83> You guys need to play Hokido sometime
[2:27:59] <worldbrand> I mean... there are still programming languages, and there's more than one type of assembly
[2:28:21] <Prevot> does this book explain what nakama means
[2:28:38] <%wydamn> @Prevot LULZ
[2:28:47] <foreverN2dust> I'd be really interested to play this with my Esperanto group.
[2:28:58] <%wolfofsound> @Prevot no that's one piece
[2:29:00] <MelBrooksKA> Programming languages are for humans, not the machines @worldbrand
[2:29:05] <gsoto83> Yeah but programming language isn't really language, its more like building materials and instructions. Like, do you have to actively think about breathing?
[2:29:25] <MelBrooksKA> I am now
[2:29:33] <worldbrand> yeah that's more than fair

[2:29:34] <%alpacapologist> ded wooliePOYO
[2:29:36] <gsoto83> Good, don't EVER forget
[2:29:43] <%Itselguapo> The robots in this world all speak in Regigigas, Regice, and all that so they speak in wubs and computer noises
[2:29:44] <%Irridium> I was born in a small village. I was still a child when we were raided by soldiers. Foreign soldiers. Torn from my elders, I was made to speak their language. With each new post, my masters changed along with the words they made me speak. With each change, I changed, too. My thoughts, personality, how I saw right and wrong. Words can kill.
[2:30:00] <foreverN2dust> I fuck with this game, gonna have to try it
[2:30:05] <worldbrand> the age of ash and dragons

[2:30:29] <SheefEatsBeef> whoahooooah
[2:30:39] <gsoto83> jesus, this game is too science man
[2:30:51] <Prevot> finally getting to the language
[2:31:12] <Superdandy96> @gsoto83 you could say it’s “Weird Science” Kappa
[2:31:20] <gsoto83> Booo
[2:31:37] <gsoto83> I would have said Wired Science
[2:31:45] <gsoto83> woolieSMUG
[2:31:46] <+RealThiele> chrono cross board game
[2:32:12] <gsoto83> Fuck @RealThiele I've never heard the sound of printing money, BUT THATS GOTTA BE IT
[2:33:55] <worldbrand> it seems pretty immediate that the game explores language as an expression of culture rather than a set of rules used to communicate
[2:34:36] <gsoto83> yeah, its actual language birth
[2:35:38] <Sedrelic> is there a winning condition?
[2:36:03] <worldbrand> probably not, but it sounds like there is an end
[2:36:14] <ghostravens> no, it's more of a roleplaying experience than a competitive thing
[2:36:16] <CazadorDeWulf> Hate to be that guy, but when's NUNS 4?
[2:36:25] <+b_bang_> more like inventing colloquialisms

[2:37:42] <%RioGascar> who is helping least
[2:38:10] <gsoto83> Reggie is now the character that will burn down an orphanage while saying "Don't you see?? Its the ONLY WAY!!!"
[2:38:12] <Sedrelic> can we call the corpse fuel "soul"
[2:39:13] <%wolfofsound> a nursery ward is just a gas station if you think about it

[2:43:22] <+Arkfyre> mobile form and blender form
[2:43:40] <+SlappyMeats> it could be a situation where you have some sort of compound you apply to the bodies to process it in a rudimentary form
[2:43:45] <+jiggy_snipe> processing would be ok I guess
[2:43:45] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1219688583491092483?s=19
[2:43:51] <gsoto83> Is the daily grind a wood chipper?
[2:43:58] <worldbrand> processing sounds like the right amount of raw but this isnt a game about just making euphemisms is it?

[2:47:01] <gsoto83> Let the acid flash back wash over you @worldbrand
[2:47:11] <MelBrooksKA> Remember when kids were surfing the web
[2:47:28] <%Irridium> the internet is a series of tubes
[2:47:30] <%wolfofsound> remember when you could download ram
[2:47:34] <MelBrooksKA> I don't, that terminology was stupid
[2:47:46] <@akuda_bar> Looking back, I told way more people than I ever should have that I was a 12 year old girl perusing the internet LMAO
[2:47:52] <Prevot> what
[2:47:52] <gsoto83> @MelBrooksKA I was surfing for some of that sweet cyberporn on a 56k modem! God. I think I was 14?
[2:48:00] <foreverN2dust> @wolfofsound you technically can with the right quality of 3D printer
[2:48:05] <@akuda_bar> because it was true, that's not an RP joke

[2:49:05] <%xpakeo> xpakeo subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Keep being you Mr. Woolzez
[2:49:10] <Matrixvingian> The level of intense focus these guys are willing to put into this.
[2:49:12] <%The_Timo> @akuda_bar should be the other way round lol
[2:49:15] <%Irridium> I'm "GET OFF THE AOL I'M WAITING FOR A CALL"
[2:49:19] <+SlappyMeats> I mean just telling somebody you're a 12 year old girl doesn't mean they're gonna come get you, it's not like you're giving out your home address and class schedule
[2:49:29] <%Irridium> I was on the AOL.
[2:49:43] <+jiggy_snipe> Reggie is gonna sacrifice all of them for the one purpose
[2:49:46] <@akuda_bar> yeah but you'd think i would've received a lot more dick pics

[2:54:54] <+Dr_DangerPhD> Reggie all about that prime directive
[2:55:02] <gsoto83> Shit, he is that detective robot
[2:55:06] <Prevot> going maverick basically
[2:55:08] <Matrixvingian> [ UNCONFIRMED PARAMETER ]
[2:55:14] <worldbrand> genius kojumbo
[2:55:16] <Matrixvingian> Dev = Human?
[2:55:28] <Matrixvingian> Robo Kayfabe
[2:55:30] <%RioGascar> going DEV sounds fucking menancing
[2:55:36] <Matrixvingian> Silicon inside baseball.
[2:55:42] <@akuda_bar> reggie missed his true calling as an evil robot overlord
[2:55:45] <MelBrooksKA> I'm a dev
[2:55:45] <Matrixvingian> We are watching lore in the making.
[2:55:45] <%RioGascar> this was SLOW start
[2:55:46] <gsoto83> Goding dev sounds like something from reboot
[2:55:49] <Superdandy96> I like it
[2:55:50] <%RioGascar> like really slow start
[2:55:54] <trianglehat> OmegAlpha, save us from the DEVil
[2:55:56] <%RioGascar> but man it got good
[2:56:01] <worldbrand> I wonder how this language dies
[2:56:03] <Matrixvingian> I'm fine with the slow burn. This is an intimate beginning.
[2:56:04] <%wolfofsound> if reggie ever expresses interest in getting turned into AI please kill him
[2:56:06] <MelBrooksKA> I like it
[2:56:07] <worldbrand> because we could keep using it forever
[2:56:08] <gsoto83> Yeah, cause its actual world building
[2:56:09] <coracor> going dev, going to work for EA...
[2:56:22] <Matrixvingian> I'm willing to chill. Everyone has time to think instead of being charactures to entertain us.
[2:56:35] <gsoto83> EA is like the digital salt mines
[2:56:38] <Matrixvingian> 2human4stream
[2:56:49] <+SlappyMeats> I'm not convinced this game is about creating language, at least not anything new, when every created word pretty much just amounts to slang rooted in already-known jargon
[2:56:50] <%RioGascar> i feel like reggies character would always be in the conversation
[2:56:51] <+jiggy_snipe> Reggie should communicate with himself
[2:56:52] <Matrixvingian> TenCent challenger appears!
[2:56:55] <MelBrooksKA> What are the pachinko mines?
[2:56:58] <gsoto83> Detroit too human, 3 fragment
[2:56:59] <worldbrand> OA wants to watch.
[2:57:16] <%RioGascar> reggie would always be in since hes WE and YOU are WE
[2:57:18] <Matrixvingian> Real Durandal hours.
[2:57:31] <+jiggy_snipe> Kansas
[2:57:38] <Sedrelic> the game can devolve into "robot pun creator" very easily it seems
[2:57:45] <Matrixvingian> Outlier Consideration
[2:57:53] <%Itselguapo> I COME FROM THE LAND DOWN UNDAH!!!!
[2:57:53] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:57:58] <foreverN2dust> the fires should take care of it for you FeelsBadMan
[2:58:04] <+jiggy_snipe> "private"
[2:58:13] <gsoto83> VPN with HTTPS
[2:58:17] <Matrixvingian> The OVer-Reggie is denied that channel.
[2:58:19] <%RioGascar> ^^^^^^^^
[2:58:22] <+Dr_Mooose> time to undermine the OmegaAdmin
[2:58:27] <+SlappyMeats> @Sedrelic yeah, DEVinitely MrDestructoid
[2:58:31] <Matrixvingian> REGCOM
[2:58:42] <%Irridium> don't got that wifi password
[2:58:43] <Prevot> this conversation is behind 7 proxies
[2:58:48] <gsoto83> what???
[2:58:52] <%RioGascar> @WoolieVersus idea HTTPS is the only one that can connect privately cause hes SECURE he is seperate from OA
[2:58:57] <gsoto83> Reggie will remember this
[2:58:58] <MelBrooksKA> Are the dotted circles part of the board game or the table?
[2:59:07] <gsoto83> OmegaAdMin remembers all
[2:59:08] <%wolfofsound> Australia is a problem...
[2:59:09] <+jiggy_snipe> @RioGascar I like that
[2:59:21] <%Itselguapo> Australia is still on fire we're not sure how but it is.....
[2:59:27] <%king_wragles> test
[2:59:30] <Prevot> HTTPS is a spawn of the DEVil
[2:59:36] <%RioGascar> ^^^^^
[2:59:40] <%RioGascar> oh i dig that
[2:59:41] <gsoto83> lol
[2:59:45] <worldbrand> I think the circles are part of the game, delineating the ages and which words exist in which age?
[2:59:53] <%king_wragles> Weird, anyone know why Twitch kept saying I was posting too much?
[3:00:00] <%wolfofsound> oh no, he needs to be wiped
[3:00:06] <suikudo> Whats going on?
[3:00:07] <foreverN2dust> twist: Mihn is Woolie's CA
[3:00:08] <gsoto83> Whats wrong with going dev? WHY DON"T WE DO ALL THE DRUGS!
[3:00:12] <suikudo> What they playin
[3:00:15] <Prevot> oh no not the 8th gate
[3:00:16] <%Itselguapo> Reggie digging this
[3:00:17] <+jiggy_snipe> the 8th gate bankai
[3:00:18] <waffleandman> too many questions monkaS
[3:00:20] <+GarbageNirvana> Are you a replicant
[3:00:23] <+ausl0> OA is super in
[3:00:27] <@akuda_bar> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp the drama!!
[3:00:27] <%RioGascar> i am so fuckign in
[3:00:31] <gsoto83> @suikudo its a roleplaying world build game it seems, build around making language
[3:00:31] <Sedrelic> to uncertainty
[3:00:41] <thesickestzak> It’s always fun joining these streams half way through a game and not having any idea what’s going on joltzTheThing
[3:00:42] <ghostravens> reggie is super in
[3:00:46] <MelBrooksKA> Did they say the water level rose?
[3:00:48] <ghostravens> and so am i
[3:00:52] <Matrixvingian> Is the guy in glasses the editor guy "Billy"?
[3:00:58] <Matrixvingian> Delicious BYTEs.
[3:00:58] <gsoto83> Yes
[3:00:58] <+GarbageNirvana> Does this society have a Voight-Kampff test I wonder
[3:01:01] <+jiggy_snipe> yes
[3:01:01] <%Irridium> down with the DEVil
[3:01:07] <gsoto83> I'll take a Byte of the corpse
[3:01:09] <@akuda_bar> @thesickestzak language simulation game, they're RPing as robots after the apocalypse and defining terms
[3:01:14] <UberKingKai> Is this dialect?
[3:01:17] <gsoto83> SoulBytes
[3:01:19] <%croxeye> yes
[3:01:23] <trianglehat> take a bite from the DEVil
[3:01:24] <%RioGascar> ...
[3:01:26] <%wolfofsound> thus, soul bites
[3:01:30] <%RioGascar> soulbyte is fucking good
[3:01:36] <UberKingKai> This game is so good
[3:01:37] <Sedrelic> cluster
[3:01:38] <gsoto83> wait
[3:01:39] <Matrixvingian> BTUs?
[3:01:40] <%wolfofsound> Killing Bytes!
[3:01:48] <@Solidus_113> Petabyte
[3:01:48] <gsoto83> bit or Byte
[3:01:54] <Matrixvingian> Calorie Burn?
[3:01:56] <ghostravens> OS?
[3:02:00] <%wolfofsound> killabyte for short
[3:02:02] <%Itselguapo> Killerbyte
[3:02:07] <boomgar> byte. sol
[3:02:08] <gsoto83> ^^^
[3:02:09] <Matrixvingian> Disposal Ratio
[3:02:14] <+Darastrix> Source code
[3:02:14] <Matrixvingian> Ha ha@
[3:02:23] <Matrixvingian> Maybe Output?
[3:02:24] <%RioGascar> okay so Soulbyte is a SINGLE soul
[3:02:25] <gsoto83> Infernobyte
[3:02:29] <MelBrooksKA> Does a large person have more energy than small?
[3:02:34] <Matrixvingian> Discreet Humanoid Unit.
[3:02:37] <Ragnorok64> homobyte
[3:02:44] <%RioGascar> so you get more and more and eventually get from SoulBite to SoulByte
[3:02:48] <+cvp5127> woolies becomes shinra
[3:02:53] <Matrixvingian> Personal Serial Code
[3:02:57] <+PenmanLupine> yeah, it's homobyte
[3:02:59] <+jiggy_snipe> souls become soulbytes
[3:03:02] <gsoto83> what about fat people, do we contain more data?
[3:03:03] <MahoganyWoods> 77,777
[3:03:12] <%wolfofsound> @gsoto83 you're like a TB
[3:03:13] <+jiggy_snipe> soulbits become soulbytes I mean
[3:03:13] <gsoto83> Ka-Byte?
[3:03:14] <ghostravens> hbyte?
[3:03:17] <%RioGascar> isnt DNA sorta data
[3:03:21] <damascussteele> but the data is energy? calobytes
[3:03:31] <Matrixvingian> Well aside from calories maybe something along the lines of energy footprint?
[3:03:34] <Sedrelic> homo liters
[3:03:34] <gsoto83> @wolfofsound I don't know if I should be mad or happy about that
[3:03:35] <Ragnorok64> HOMOBYTE my man
[3:03:43] <Matrixvingian> Energy Density?
[3:03:46] <generalve> atpCarl atpCarl atpCarl atpCarl atpCarl
[3:04:03] <%wolfofsound> @gsoto83 feel..........terable Kappa
[3:04:03] <+SlappyMeats> the thing is, any of these words could just be any sound at all, words are only significant because of their ascribed meaning, and the meaning is what they've already established through the connections of concepts. The word can be "URRHGH" for all it matters.
[3:04:08] <gsoto83> Instead of Carbon footprint, calorie footprint?
[3:04:09] <Matrixvingian> Ape-Bits
[3:04:09] <worldbrand> It's not unheard of
[3:04:09] <@akuda_bar> Homo Bite
[3:04:11] <peter_pipe_her_> ahhh homo!
[3:04:13] <@Solidus_113> LudenBytes
[3:04:13] <+GarbageNirvana> Demensbytes
[3:04:19] <%Itselguapo> no homobytes here

[3:04:33] <%wolfofsound> nenbyte
[3:04:34] <trianglehat> necroByte
[3:04:40] <worldbrand> I mean we break down models in 3D to polygons, and those polygons into triangles, so you can refer to things by poly count or triangle count. you can say this has 253,706 tris
[3:04:43] <Matrixvingian> GraveBytes
[3:04:43] <gsoto83> ThanoByte
[3:04:47] <+GarbageNirvana> Cenobytes
[3:04:59] <Matrixvingian> I like ThanoBytes

[3:05:15] <Matrixvingian> What about logic gates or the energy needed for a computational cycle.
[3:05:15] <damascussteele> @garbagenirvana like hellraiser?
[3:05:21] <worldbrand> RARs
[3:05:26] <gsoto83> or sectors
[3:05:27] <foreverN2dust> bytes, bits, units, sectors, clusters
[3:05:33] <+GarbageNirvana> Or partitions yeah
[3:05:37] <Matrixvingian> Get into the idea of reincarnation and have it be GraveChace?
[3:05:41] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> use those bits to wise up

[3:05:45] <gsoto83> ^^^
[3:05:45] <%RioGascar> SoulTition
[3:05:49] <+SlappyMeats> also, are robots really fuckin' around with the concept of soul?

[3:06:29] <MelBrooksKA> Computer heap
[3:06:32] <worldbrand> sliding into your robo-dms
[3:06:45] <gsoto83> ohmy
[3:06:47] <%RioGascar> @WoolieVersus Idea: HTTPS is the only robot that can open private comms because that robot is SECURE and seperate from OA

[3:07:47] <gsoto83> I like how Minh is so robotic and woolie is like "What the fuck do you want man!"
[3:07:49] <%wolfofsound> top side of the table is gonna fuck over the bottom half calling it
[3:07:51] <+Arkfyre> going for sort of a robo-abathur?
[3:07:57] <Prevot> MrDestructoid
[3:08:02] <MelBrooksKA> @RioGascar needs more back doors
[3:08:06] <Matrixvingian> Getting real Engine Heart vibes from this. Wuh woh Row Row fight the Process!
[3:08:06] <+SlappyMeats> Woolie is my spirit robot
[3:08:17] <%wolfofsound> @Arkfyre fuck I would love abathur in a borg type setting
[3:08:26] <Matrixvingian> He's using "I" verses the collective Process.

[3:08:44] <Prevot> none of the other robots talk like that, Minh chooses to sound like a robot
[3:08:49] <Matrixvingian> REGCOM
[3:08:51] <jazzygrooves_> LUL i still cant stop laughing at that name
[3:08:52] <gsoto83> More librarys than any nod
[3:08:53] <%wolfofsound> "sorry lag"
[3:08:54] <+Dr_Mooose> Minh's an older model
[3:08:55] <Sedrelic> full mechazawa
[3:09:02] <+SlappyMeats> BEEP BOOP I AM A MAGICIAN
[3:09:05] <@Solidus_113> Minh is losing packets
[3:09:09] <gsoto83> Hes just working off of older script lines
[3:09:12] <SheefEatsBeef> oooo
[3:09:14] <+Dr_Mooose> ooooooo
[3:09:19] <%Itselguapo> Mecharata! Mecharata! Mecharata!
[3:09:19] <trianglehat> oh snap
[3:09:19] <+ausl0> Woolie gonna get reported to OA soon
[3:09:20] <SumKnowBuddy> i'd like to think that the manipulator chooses to talk like that to sound smart
[3:09:21] <%king_wragles> Do NOT disrespect the Dead Master!

[3:09:31] <Matrixvingian> MINH-GEN's gonna debug you so hard!
[3:09:40] <%Itselguapo> Woolie going True Neutral/Chaotic Neutral
[3:09:40] <gsoto83> And Minh goes to snitch
[3:09:41] <Matrixvingian> Prepare your I/O port.
[3:09:49] <$jobbedbone> that azumanga hoodie is great
[3:09:57] <%RioGascar> IF YOU GO DEV
[3:10:00] <+SlappyMeats> Robots are clearly showing a strong sense of irony already to call the most robotic character the Magician
[3:10:01] <%RioGascar> YOU GET DEBUGGED
[3:10:05] <gsoto83> Chaotic neutral, minh is lawful neutral
[3:10:37] <%alpacapologist> @croxeye i wasn't here to say it but thank you for the gift sub wooliePOYO
[3:10:54] <%RioGascar> @SlappyMeats minhs character can make use of the dead corpses in some magic way
[3:11:01] <%Itselguapo> This makes me want to see Woolie do D&D shit
[3:11:02] <%RioGascar> therefore magician
[3:11:06] <+SlappyMeats> no I know the justification
[3:11:11] <gsoto83> Reggie is like "tell me all your dirty little secrets"
[3:11:19] <%JJCheeker> JJCheeker subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[3:11:22] <+undercoverbarber> Boot up in SAFE MODE
[3:11:22] <FaderPotater> whats the game?
[3:11:32] <%RioGascar> the database being OA
[3:12:08] <%RioGascar> this really makes me wanna just particapate in this
[3:12:08] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:12:09] <+jiggy_snipe> Dialect
[3:12:28] <Matrixvingian> What if Minh could Nanomagic corpses to the recycling pyres?
[3:12:32] <Prevot> lewd
[3:12:35] <+ausl0> "you've been selected for a random search" - Reggie
[3:12:42] <trianglehat> can the log memory overfill? potentially lose / hide some history
[3:13:06] <+FloorBurger> Obituary
[3:13:19] <@akuda_bar> woolieREGGIEFUL Edit
[3:13:26] <%king_wragles> That.... that kinda sounds like asking if someone is doing the five finger shuffle
[3:13:27] <Matrixvingian> I do like Obit since these bots are caretakers of Mankind's ruin.
[3:13:27] <gsoto83> OA pulls up the terminal and runs /ls-cache/ find *.dev
[3:13:28] <%RioGascar> ah it works in multiple angles
[3:13:54] <gsoto83> PS, I'm loving this mic set up
[3:13:54] <BurdRightsActivist> WORDS THAT KILL
[3:13:58] <trianglehat> Reggie stealing the show
[3:14:11] <@Solidus_113> The Reg knows all
[3:14:15] <%king_wragles> You can't steal the show if you ARE the show
[3:14:18] <%RioGascar> i can already feel reggie is the overlord and woolies HTTPS wants to be on his own SECURE line
[3:14:20] <%king_wragles> foreheadguy.jpg
[3:14:21] <gsoto83> The Reg sees all
[3:14:30] <trianglehat> Reg is all
[3:14:36] <%RioGascar> reg is in any conversation that is not SECURE
[3:14:41] <gsoto83> Look, sometimes people just want a secure line
[3:14:52] <@Solidus_113> Reg knows you used a VPN
[3:15:01] <gsoto83> Encryption is a right to all mecha
[3:15:03] <+FloorBurger> We need a Regulator.
[3:15:12] <+jiggy_snipe> @RioGascar are Woolie's connections secure by default?
[3:15:18] <gsoto83> Reg knows you spoofed your IP address
[3:15:21] <%RioGascar> i would say yes
[3:15:25] <%RioGascar> cause HTTPS
[3:15:29] <eyezehuhh> I came to the stream extra late and this sounds like a terrace house conversation!
[3:15:30] <+ausl0> Reggie is omnipresent
[3:15:40] <%king_wragles> Register Reggie at reggiereg . registration . com
[3:15:45] <Sedrelic> an hologram
[3:15:48] <%RioGascar> i would also say HTTPS is the only one that can communicate outside of OA's network
[3:15:53] <%RioGascar> and he doesnt like that
[3:16:42] <+steelmorrigan> Minh just strihgt up going to sell everone out
[3:17:14] <Prevot> oh god more MrDestructoid talk
[3:17:17] <trianglehat> robocall
[3:17:19] <%K2YP70C0CK> doodJJ doodJJ
[3:17:25] <foreverN2dust> Snitch PogChamp
[3:17:30] <+jiggy_snipe> Minh you snitch
[3:17:34] <+ausl0> snitching FeelsBadMan
[3:17:35] <gsoto83> Reggie is the linux server, but not a good one like red hat, hes like the chinese spy bot linux, DeepOne
[3:17:51] <MelBrooksKA> !snitch
[3:17:52] <waffleandman> the plot thickens
[3:17:52] <+Dr_Mooose> snitch bot
[3:17:54] <+SlappyMeats> Magiches get stitches
[3:17:57] <%RioGascar> time for HTTPS to just set up shop in australia
[3:17:59] <%RioGascar> alone
[3:18:07] <%CappuccinoGuil> This is a co-op game. Minh IMMEDIATELY snitching and betraying the group. Classic.
[3:18:19] <gsoto83> Classic Minh
[3:18:22] <%RioGascar> thats every coop game
[3:18:36] <%Itselguapo> Lawful evil Reggie incoming!
[3:18:43] <SheefEatsBeef> the rogue https
[3:18:45] <Balr0g_> 🤔
[3:18:45] <%RioGascar> also minh might still be salty at last table lords
[3:18:47] <+jiggy_snipe> all his communications are private to OA too
[3:18:57] <Matrixvingian> I like to think the Magician Integration Neural Holistics COM's verbal tics work in game as well. It's doing such esoteric processes that the vocoder is a bottom priority.
[3:19:17] <gsoto83> Reggie is gonna attach a Nod-lin to Woolie, I BET YOU
[3:19:18] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:19:18] <%RioGascar> if you go DEV you must be DEBUGGED
[3:19:19] <+jiggy_snipe> 65!?
[3:19:21] <Prevot> The Manipulator is overheating and lagging because he overclocked his cluster usage so much
[3:19:21] <trianglehat> https gone DEViant, issue the final defrag
[3:19:47] <gsoto83> Is this 3rd impact from Eva???
[3:19:54] <gsoto83> I don't know that animus
[3:19:55] <foreverN2dust> Reggie would make a decent sith lord.
[3:19:58] <worldbrand> in edge bot city
[3:20:15] <%RioGascar> so HTTPS is now rogue

[3:34:44] <Solidnick18> hello what game is this?
[3:34:53] <+jiggy_snipe> Dialect
[3:34:57] <Matrixvingian> I believe it's "Dialect".
[3:34:59] <gsoto83> Reggie no like this
[3:35:01] <NeroInfinite> It's 11 pm and they are still going
[3:35:04] <jazzygrooves_> check the upper right corner @Solidnick18
[3:35:09] <+FloorBurger> OA is quaking right now.
[3:35:11] <Solidnick18> what's it about?
[3:35:11] <redstrawherring> Remove DRM
[3:35:14] <@Solidus_113> Is a robot smuggling USBs around to get away from OA?
[3:35:25] <%Irridium> get that dunovo out
[3:35:35] <+steelmorrigan> I love it the "patch"
[3:35:38] <trianglehat> jailbreak
[3:35:47] <+jiggy_snipe> I want to see how Reggie's character reacts to this
[3:35:53] <gsoto83> Virtualize!
[3:35:54] <jazzygrooves_> @Solidnick18 roleplaying the birth and death of a language, currently theyre robots trying to cleanse the earth i think
[3:35:58] <+steelmorrigan> Reggie freaking out
[3:35:58] <SumKnowBuddy> Reggie monkaS
[3:36:00] <Prevot> incognito mode
[3:36:04] <%RioGascar> i believe the Reg would be unable to have another Registry
[3:36:14] <%RioGascar> it would break in system terms
[3:36:15] <+ausl0> can't hide from OA. They'll find out
[3:36:19] <%Irridium> auto-deletes your browser history
[3:36:20] <MelBrooksKA> onion mode
[3:36:21] <Solidnick18> sound dope
[3:36:39] <+GarbageNirvana> How would said "patch" be passed around anyway
[3:36:45] <+GarbageNirvana> Just like evangelism or
[3:36:46] <%RioGascar> i feel the patch would be from HTTPS
[3:36:49] <%RioGascar> since again
[3:36:51] <%RioGascar> SECURE
[3:36:56] <FaderPotater> a day of self
[3:36:58] <generalve> this game......
[3:37:03] <+GarbageNirvana> Also how close are we getting to Detroit Become Human
[3:37:12] <Solidnick18> very close
[3:37:12] <@Solidus_113> "take a hit off this update bro, it'll enhance your individuality"
[3:37:17] <@akuda_bar> I love the idea of calling it a partition
[3:37:20] <+steelmorrigan> what makes this awesome is that the "Patch" becomes a moevemnt as well as an actual peic of software .. and cliamign you"patch" makes you part of the "resistance" as it were
[3:37:21] <generalve> MINH is wearing a amahoa dioah shirt !
[3:37:23] <%RioGascar> the patch would be passed around by connecting to HTTPS secure netowrk and downloading the update
[3:37:24] <+jiggy_snipe> they need to use Woolie as the cause of the patch especially since he was an explorer
[3:37:58] <%RioGascar> when you download the patch you become UPDATED
[3:38:01] <+steelmorrigan> Because that's how language works Minh.
[3:38:04] <+FloorBurger> The Schism

[4:03:47] <worldbrand> yeah i gotta agree
[4:03:48] <trianglehat> yea are the new words even supposed to be rooted in english?
[4:04:08] <MelBrooksKA> Woolie has become a kernel oops

[4:04:26] <gsoto83> was bling rooted in english?

[4:23:25] <+cvp5127> yes
[4:23:29] <%RioGascar> humanity is gone

[4:23:42] <topherg789> @melbrookska nice
[4:23:42] <smugjorgen98> @jazzygrooves_ type of game
[4:23:50] <trianglehat> robots purpose is to dispose corpses, it's also what fuels them
[4:24:13] <trianglehat> no more humans no more corpses
[4:24:25] <13ig_Kain> See they know D&D
[4:24:29] <JDebss> Lawful evil best alignment
[4:24:43] <fallenverto81> DnD, the Devil's Game!
[4:24:51] <%RioGascar> alignments arent D&D
[4:24:59] <MelBrooksKA> But dies Mihn know why kids love the taste of cinnamon toast crunch?
[4:25:03] <%RioGascar> or at least not origin by D&D
[4:25:17] <topherg789> so almost a no dm dnd?
[4:25:33] <jazzygrooves_> @smugjorgen98 theyre roleplaying a story around the birth and death of the language, so in the roleplay it really depends. Sometimes you might not get a conflict like this
[4:25:58] <%K2YP70C0CK> Mihn might undertand 'crunchy' & 'wet'
[4:26:12] <worldbrand> the game was pitched as having an emphasis on language, and there are some bits about making new words from sounds

[4:53:03] <%RioGascar> i guess if there was a host showing the tables it might sorta work but wont be perfect

[5:47:56] <Matrixvingian> Imagine having these insane crossovers be remembered by the characters in their mainline franchises.

[5:48:39] <Matrixvingian> I feel bad for the Original Characters that only live in that one crossover.

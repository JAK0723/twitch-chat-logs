[0:34:15] <rubbishbinge> ?
[0:34:25] <+Grayhammatter> transplant eyes is so bad
[0:34:26] <arkv01> organ
[0:34:27] <+hoenhime344> this goes back to the "Everyone can do a kamehameha wave"
[0:34:27] <%Reverend_Roscoe> THAT'S THE DUMBEST?!
[0:34:29] <arkv01> donations
[0:34:37] <khetrak> transplant i a strong word for what we have on naruto, i think equiped is more close to what they do

[0:34:42] <+NWannabe> i hope cody rhodes takes so much time so when he turns black hat we really hate it
[0:34:43] <%Th3SmartAlec> The problem is that the eyes start getting thrown around like it's a game of hot potato
[0:34:44] <+BubbaRands> It was cool when it wasn't trivial LUL
[0:34:46] <+Mkingston> @akuda_bar yep. Never streamed and never shaved my head before. Could be a car crash.
[0:34:50] <%jiggy_snipe> it was fine when one guy had it
[0:34:58] <+hoenhime344> @Reverend_Roscoe my thought exactly. all of the issues and THAT is what he has a problem with?
[0:35:02] <@akuda_bar> should do a test stream where you shave your ass first woolieSMUG
[0:35:03] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:35:09] <%JetpackMcQuack> Show the eye transplant you coward
[0:35:09] <+BubbaRands> Danzo just ruined it
[0:35:09] <%jiggy_snipe> it became stupid once you see Danzo's arm
[0:35:10] <wannabemoogle> Then Sauske kept his brothers
[0:35:10] <Diana869> seeing the eye for the first time ever was very cool
[0:35:12] <%Th3SmartAlec> The fact that the eyes are usable by anyone is the confusing bit
[0:35:18] <nepwar> the mystery of the eye is more interesting than the answers we have been given
[0:35:21] <PlainSimpleTailor> What's up with Minh's audio?
[0:35:23] <%Th3SmartAlec> The Uchiha are just magic eye factories

[0:36:01] <zecaptain_james> Uchiha eyes on the inside
[0:36:01] <%Th3SmartAlec> Danzo's like "I GOT AN ARM OF SHARIGANS"
[0:36:04] <phatmac16> Danzo is the worst for this
[0:36:08] <+BubbaRands> just pop it out and shove it in you socket
[0:36:09] <%Visorak6> Stealing powers is yawn
[0:36:09] <%ChoculaUltra> imagine being Danzo and like going to your surgeon and explaining you want ALL the eyes...in your arm.

[0:41:07] <%RioGascar> Rebels changes it to make the sabers like very thin
[0:41:13] <+hoenhime344> MinhDidNothingWrong
[0:41:14] <Nillard> Ninjala you mean Dissidia?
[0:41:14] <%Solidnick18> pretty fun
[0:41:22] <%DatAsuna> rebels still did the smear effect though
[0:41:27] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> @riogascar All three of then
[0:41:28] <DaBigVitus> Woolie really embraced the grandmas tablecloth aesthetic
[0:41:34] <%Hawkbone_> I don't really care about the Ninjala beta. Its a free to play game anyway I'll just try it when it comes out.
[0:41:35] <%VaguelyKai> cheer500 "While not always perfect, A hero's gotta do what a Hero's gotta do." Reggie says before he drops the plate. Wollie, bring it back. Use these echoes for blood
[0:41:36] <Brandon__Brando> the tea kettle continues
[0:41:43] <Decimated_body> Minh has NEVER been a Darkling he is the TRUE HERO
[0:41:45] <BallerSwagBro9k> THE BLOODSHED BEGINS
[0:41:45] <masterfire23> gendy work is so good. I wish he made more sym-biontic titans3
[0:41:45] <%Superdandy96> Minh the secret villain disguised as a friend. Bitchpie’s just Eric Sparrow plus a sprinkle of Gary oak
[0:41:48] <+Grayhammatter> the tea kettle is back on the burner

[0:43:26] <%Hawkbone_> @DesertPenguin Its fine. They wouldn't do it if they thought it would cause problems.
[0:43:29] <ALTRNico> is he threatening reggie to get cancer?
[0:43:30] <Brandon__Brando> love the switch in personality that woolie dose the second the cameras start rolling
[0:43:35] <+cindermain> we boo you and the rock at the same time

[0:43:45] <%ChoculaUltra> Can I learn this power?
[0:43:46] <%DatAsuna> Sounds like the words of a jobber
[0:43:48] <%RioGascar> This is like saying theres no politics in call of duty, THERES OBVIOUSLY SOME POLITICAL nature going on
[0:43:48] <DaBigVitus> pre-game monologue eh
[0:43:51] <%Th3SmartAlec> @ALTRNico Hey man. Woolie's just talking Kappa
[0:43:55] <thesickestzak> Hopefully Goku (Reggie) and Frieza (Woolie) team up to stop Jiren (Minh) today before he keeps running away with it
[0:43:55] <VJdarkworld> Corporate Champion
[0:43:56] <+hoenhime344> I dissagree @DesertPenguin i think it shows the TRUE intentions and skill of all three of the players involved
[0:43:58] <C4m3r0n0409> Cancer?
[0:44:01] <BAM4LFE> is vince palpatine?
[0:44:05] <%Superdandy96> Woolie’s just pissed he’s not getting enough love as Reggie Kappa
[0:44:05] <%FuqBoiSlim> Are you familiar with the tragedy of Romaine Lettuce?
[0:44:09] <Decimated_body> SNEK FEET
[0:44:09] <deepspaceshine> If Reggie is the Roman Reigns who is the Daniel Bryan?

[0:44:10] <thesickestzak> nliAhhh nliAhhh nliAhhh
[0:44:12] <C4m3r0n0409> Whats the moral
[0:44:14] <khetrak> @WoolieVersus do you guys watch AEW ?
[0:44:19] <%Hawkbone_> You denying Reggie's status as Peoples Champion makes this the exact opposite of a Roman Reigns situation
[0:44:23] <+hoenhime344> Reggie is a FALSE HERO
[0:44:24] <%derap41> #Notmychamp
[0:44:26] <%nocturne_reverie> What is a McMahon? a miserable pile of secrets

[0:44:27] <%Chatterbox1991> Joe A'noai (Roman Reigns) is a legitimately awesome person

[0:49:35] <+Grayhammatter> not far enough
[0:49:44] <+Grayhammatter> reggie is the darkling

[0:50:11] <Shishi1205> PogChamp
[0:50:14] <Camail> 80%
[0:50:15] <iswearimjustdandy> Anime watchers: watch the vods. Youre a whole season behind
[0:50:15] <%RioGascar> This game needs a objective button or some shit to refresh memory on what you need to be doing
[0:50:19] <%jiggy_snipe> well that changes stuff now
[0:50:22] <wendisky> Woolie has money
[0:50:23] <+kekkerscrew> This is what you do when you've got a Crap ton of Cash

[0:50:44] <%Th3SmartAlec> Unless?
[0:50:46] <+mrcooperblack> can you invest until you're in debt?
[0:50:46] <+kekkerscrew> The point of castles is to Bank all of your cash at once
[0:50:53] <%Fujiwara_92> unless
[0:50:54] <%legacy0117> Wait there was a castle banking system in this game the WHOLE TIME?
[0:50:55] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> Oh shit...Reggie should have done that
[0:50:56] <%LiquidShake83> all in
[0:50:57] <Decimated_body> Hahahahaha....Unless?
[0:50:57] <mdkcde> watch Reggie luck into 200 Dark Arts and steal that castle
[0:50:59] <iswearimjustdandy> @andrewslovespizza knives are all concealed in pants
[0:51:00] <%Superdandy96> Anime watchers: they’re will be spoilers, watch the vods to catch up or just watch them on YouTube. You’ve been warned
[0:51:02] <thesickestzak> Unless
[0:51:18] <AndrewsLovesPizza> @iswearimjustdandy atpSolid
[0:51:19] <Camail> this game has so many systems
[0:51:28] <DepressoResto> yo
[0:51:31] <DepressoResto> i love this game
[0:51:32] <+kekkerscrew> Yep legacy0117 Everyone being worried about how having lots of cash on hand being worthless didn't know about the Castle banks

[0:51:52] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> Lol. Best yet
[0:51:53] <%nintega010> see if he didn't waste it on come here
[0:51:56] <+Grayhammatter> 3 days
[0:51:57] <+mrcooperblack> huge rolls
[0:51:57] <nepwar> get in that pyramid
[0:51:58] <%Th3SmartAlec> Save for one more turn to go crazy
[0:51:58] <%yeetdabsenpai69> gtta take him down
[0:52:00] <%emperordread> To the pyramid of kings
[0:52:02] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> Just save it bro
[0:52:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> NICE
[0:52:04] <+Grayhammatter> can always do it again
[0:52:05] <Diana869> nice
[0:52:05] <DepressoResto> you can kill the darkling and take his weapon
[0:52:06] <%legacy0117> With Reggie could have banked ALL of the CASINO MONEY.
[0:52:08] <Mr_Ease> come here was worth it to steal the objective
[0:52:09] <Shishi1205> rip
[0:52:12] <$GenerallyAHorriblePerson> Is this your CHAMPION??? The DEVIL???
[0:52:13] <%Superdandy96> Save it Nightmare Reggie
[0:52:13] <DepressoResto> if he uses strike
[0:52:18] <+kekkerscrew> town
[0:52:31] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie needs to sprint to that shop to stand a chance
[0:52:34] <%Superdandy96> Might as well boost a town
[0:52:37] <khetrak> cash invested in a castle does not increase the amount the castle is worth but how much the item made on the castle is worth
[0:52:39] <%legacy0117> Christ.
[0:52:40] <%nintega010> @DepressoResto that's near endgame when you get hero or robo knight class is the best chance
[0:52:49] <%legacy0117> OooH.
[0:52:53] <%Livelinne> Oh nuuu I’m late🍞
[0:52:54] <%legacy0117> Okay.
[0:53:06] <iswearimjustdandy> @livelinne they like just started
[0:53:07] <%jiggy_snipe> @khetrak oh well its better than holding a bunch of cash I guess
[0:53:10] <DepressoResto> i used to low key cheat by controling the one who turned into it
[0:53:16] <%emperordread> You only missed 3 spins @Livelinne
[0:53:17] <FallenVerto81> woolieDATTEBAYO I can't believe it myself...
[0:53:17] <iswearimjustdandy> @livelinne you missed one turn
[0:53:20] <DepressoResto> make him do strike
[0:53:23] <DepressoResto> while i do counter
[0:53:24] <%Superdandy96> @nintega010 would you say the gear Knight is better then the hero? Or does that class have better looking gear?
[0:53:30] <DepressoResto> for everyweapon he has multiple times lmfao
[0:53:39] <Them00n> I haven't been following the manga, how close is the game to ending?
[0:53:49] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @The_Big_Donfather not much
[0:53:59] <%yeetdabsenpai69> they are having big adventures later
[0:54:02] <+gutlesscoward> reggie = naruto, minh= sasuke
[0:54:03] <%chickenhunter> theres still a fair bit of the game to go
[0:54:06] <%Livelinne> @iswearimjustdandy Phew. thx woolieGASM
[0:54:07] <+Pinkiefan> Pinkiefan subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:54:07] <%RioGascar> See they wont do collusion in a way of making one side lose to get weapons
[0:54:24] <%chickenhunter> there are still curveballs yet to come
[0:54:29] <%Superdandy96> @gutlesscoward so that means bitchpie is Sakura? What a worse fate
[0:54:31] <%RioGascar> however they will collude if theres no way to win a fight
[0:54:53] <%yeetdabsenpai69> if regie is smart he'll force a come here and take down the other two
[0:55:10] <%Th3SmartAlec> @yeetdabsenpai69 If he has enough Darkl Points next turn
[0:55:11] <%RioGascar> And such collusion leads to appropriate name changes
[0:55:12] <khetrak> i mean, killing then doesn't really give him anything good
[0:55:14] <%nintega010> @Superdandy96 I don't know. All I know the Robo Knight seems the easiest to get. I haven't really seen anyone get hero class in gameplay so I would love Minh to get it.
[0:55:22] <%jiggy_snipe> he only has 3 days left and 50 pts
[0:55:24] <+Grayhammatter> he did do a come here to kill minh
[0:55:29] <%chickenhunter> Hero isn't worth the effort it takes to get
[0:55:30] <WizardofWazz> cutie
[0:55:34] <%Th3SmartAlec> @khetrak It does stall them while he turns in the Demolition Man
[0:55:35] <arkv01> ma'am I'd like to sell my booty
[0:55:39] <%chickenhunter> Roboknight is *barely* worth it
[0:55:39] <%Fujiwara_92> LUL
[0:55:44] <khetrak> the best thing you can do as a dark it to move and get a lot of city adn steall castle, killing then doesn't really help a lot

[0:55:52] <thesickestzak> hon hon hon
[0:55:52] <pennykettle_> I LOVE the lack of mouth movement
[0:55:55] <%DatAsuna> I hate that shit
[0:55:57] <arkv01> the helmets help
[0:56:00] <%Superdandy96> @nintega010 I don’t know why, but when my brain hears gear Knight, I think of the ancient gear golems. So the idea of Minh piloting one sounds cool
[0:56:01] <%Th3SmartAlec> @chickenhunter Is Hero even worth it for the 3 classes you have to do?
[0:56:03] <+CptDouglasJFalcon> Hero's the kinda thing where to enjoy it everyone has to agree to go for it
[0:56:04] <+hoenhime344> @khetrak untrue, he can delete and then throw shit away. thets like 3-4 turns of them doing NOTHING but recovering
[0:56:08] <%jiggy_snipe> thats the Dark Souls quirk
[0:56:10] <CursedNobleman> id rather have no mouth movement over bad lip syncing
[0:56:10] <arkv01> no one should have to make filthy lip movements to speaka

[0:56:18] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:56:20] <%chickenhunter> Nah, the passives and actives from the other classes are arguably better than hero's
[0:56:21] <%RioGascar> most souls games also have characters who have helmets
[0:56:24] <glass_marcus> The best way to handle that is to go full bomberman and not even include mouths
[0:56:29] <+eanscrale> The cool helmets and masks make up for it
[0:56:30] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @khetrak well most of minhs strengh comes from his weapon and defensiv stuff so taking that way does weaken him quite a bit
[0:56:31] <%legacy0117> Also btw Woolie, I had given bumped your character up to Akuma, but giving up before a Darkling fight and being called that name again increased your back down levels by a lottt.

[0:57:52] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> Dokapon be screwing over Reggie these last couple of sessions
[0:57:53] <iswearimjustdandy> This is his hubris for pretending to be the hero and choosing darkness
[0:57:59] <+Veteranreaper09> 5 darksyE highigPog
[0:58:02] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie can catch up to Reggie in the Pyramid with Spinners
[0:58:05] <+Grayhammatter> and reggie goes into the pyramid PogChamp

[0:58:42] <%Th3SmartAlec> @ spinners -> 3 Spinners
[0:58:42] <+Dorf1> reggie is such a hero for choosing the low darkling rolls with his immense skill
[0:58:44] <%Superdandy96> Woolie’s playing a risky game going on
[0:58:44] <%legacy0117> This is why you are Nero still.
[0:58:48] <C4m3r0n0409> MORE SPINNERS
[0:58:53] <%alpacasintophats> besides you need to wait the turn for darkling to end
[0:59:00] <%Jetzord> I just got here, what did I miss?
[0:59:01] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Superdandy96 Only way he can get the Demolition Man when Reggie runs out
[0:59:12] <zecaptain_james> is Reggie doing the low rolls on purpose to act the underdog
[0:59:13] <wendisky> Again
[0:59:37] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Jetzord Reggie going towards Demolition Man turn in at the Pyramid, Woolie giving chase. Minh's been dead
[0:59:40] <%RioGascar> and if reggie rolls in pyramid he might just fly to whatever space he needs to land on

[1:06:35] <Pinkiefan> Acrobat is probably the best non-darkling job.
[1:06:38] <@Moobot> Easy with the emojis @hoenhime344
[1:06:40] <Klefth> Minh isn't playing to win anymore, just to fuck everyone's game up. He's impeding progress at this point

[1:07:00] <C4m3r0n0409> OH NO
[1:07:02] <thesickestzak> Do we know if any of them looked up how to get new classes after last time? Since Minh had seen and remembered how to get the hero class stuff?

[1:08:13] <%legacy0117> If it does, pray there are no more Bloodpool sized bets. It can be intense to watch when the guys take things too seriously.

[1:10:02] <nepwar> you can open it to put items but not take LUL
[1:10:06] <Shishi1205> Store warps are better
[1:10:08] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> @optimasmaximas Reggie keeps getting screwed by bad rolls
[1:10:08] <+spacehouse> FLower in Mountain

[1:10:22] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1255023082869272576
[1:10:26] <spardanwarrior> Woolie is trapped in South America, Reggie returned to the light and is in the pyramid and Minh is Minh
[1:10:36] <%Superdandy96> It’s like the game hates Reggie being a bad guy
[1:10:39] <Ipsenscastle> How long do people reckon is left in the game?
[1:10:41] <Brandon__Brando> dont count Reggie out you only need to be first on the last turn
[1:10:43] <%optimasmaximas> @ShadowpulseKDH1 ah, the bad luck has returned from the beginning i see; are the rools for the darkling points or in general?
[1:10:45] <%alpacasintophats> ditch the arrow
[1:10:53] <%gatorafan> Woolie might as well go find the Lunar Tear
[1:10:55] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Ipsenscastle At least 5 steams
[1:11:04] <Ipsenscastle> @Th3SmartAlec holy crap
[1:11:08] <thesickestzak> We're in the middle of the Great Demo Race arc
[1:11:12] <%yeetdabsenpai69> have they forgotten about magic mirrors?
[1:11:17] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Ipsenscastle Just guesstimating off their current progress
[1:11:23] <%legacy0117> Reggie has had amazing luck at the Casino though.
[1:11:26] <DaBigVitus> 20 hours left LUL
[1:11:26] <%saltpiggu> no its not
[1:11:31] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> @optimasmaximas Mostly Darkling, but he also got a shit roll for item space.
[1:11:41] <%Livelinne> 白羽の矢 a Japanese thing
[1:11:41] <%RioGascar> You cant fight fate woolie
[1:11:45] <+Grayhammatter> magic mirrors
[1:11:49] <Spydurman> no that'd let him take a town though
[1:11:56] <%optimasmaximas> @ShadowpulseKDH1 oof, thanks for the update, appreciate it
[1:11:59] <%gunsrlove> Denks Mosheri
[1:12:01] <nepwar> store would be better since you can get a chance to rebuy
[1:12:02] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> 👍
[1:12:04] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[1:12:04] <Spydurman> summon a monster to a town you want then take it
[1:12:08] <%RioGascar> the golden wind shall blow and it may or may not be in your direction
[1:12:25] <%nintega010> Minh go get show ticket
[1:12:25] <%Th3SmartAlec> Actually the bag seal will let Woolie get a Vanish before Minh can fuck him again
[1:12:29] <%RioGascar> ...summon it to danube
[1:12:40] <%Superdandy96> ^
[1:12:44] <DaBigVitus> has minh been last at all yet?
[1:12:46] <nepwar> all roads lead to danube
[1:12:49] <%emperordread> Reggie's gonna get that swish looking Taj Mahal looking sultan castle as a reward for getting the king's IOU quest done. Wonder how much it's worth
[1:12:56] <thesickestzak> RandyBitchford Requiem

[1:13:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> ...
[1:13:09] <khetrak> is minh even close to get hero? you need to master like 6 jobs for it
[1:13:11] <%Superdandy96> @dabigvitus surpassingly no. He’s always been second or sometimes first
[1:13:13] <Spydurman> Minh's been winning this from day 1, he seems to understand that taking towns is the #1 priority
[1:13:19] <%legacy0117> So, I think this makes this Manga Chapter 10. I have some catching up to do it seems.

[1:50:11] <%nintega010> woolie has to upgrade magician then he gets alchamist. Minh needs to upgrade magician to get spellsword and get acrobat then get hero license to become hero
[1:50:18] <thesickestzak> pls castle Woolie
[1:50:24] <+DrPoxx> bandit gonna get the One hit kill
[1:50:25] <%RioGascar> Too much work already for that
[1:50:40] <%Th3SmartAlec> REALLY MINH
[1:50:44] <tritachyon> DO IT MINH
[1:50:45] <Them00n> The game doesn't seem nearly as aggressive as the podcasts made it sound.
[1:50:55] <DaBigVitus> If one person unlocks a class is it available for all?
[1:51:00] <%yeetdabsenpai69> woolie needs to master ninja first i think so he gets more speed and can reduce the sped gap between him and minh
[1:51:02] <%Riottrio> @DaBigVitus nope
[1:51:02] <nelsonsaysbooya> Woolie eyeing that notebook of Mihn offenses. Adding reciepts
[1:51:05] <+soFISHticated98> were you not there like 2 weeks ago
[1:51:07] <andrei11dr> So i guess Minh is leading with Reggie being second
[1:51:07] <%nintega010> @DaBigVitus no
[1:51:08] <DaBigVitus> Harsh
[1:51:10] <+soFISHticated98> Woolie was out to MURDER Minh
[1:51:11] <C4m3r0n0409> Hakuna Matata
[1:51:16] <+hoenhime344> please no heckfire
[1:51:18] <%emperordread> Minh cleaning up, he owns like 80% of the known world
[1:51:19] <Zalthia> @them00n there are 2000 dollars on the line
[1:51:24] <+Grayhammatter> reggie is still in last
[1:51:26] <nepwar> HECKFIRE
[1:51:27] <+Gespens> BREAK
[1:51:28] <%Th3SmartAlec> COME ON
[1:51:30] <+Grayhammatter> HECKFIRE
[1:51:32] <+Mekhet09> Reggie can come back if he nukes all the towns with monsters and then takes them.
[1:51:34] <%RioGascar> The game is not aggressive. Instead it makes the players aggressive against each other
[1:51:34] <%Hawkbone_> @Them00n You haven't seen shit. This game has been very, very mean before
[1:51:37] <%yeetdabsenpai69> heckfire is nott magic
[1:51:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> Let's go Pheonix
[1:51:39] <thesickestzak> They usually don't get too salty/aggressive for the first hour oh so
[1:51:39] <+Mekhet09> He'd need one more castle.
[1:51:43] <%Riottrio> @DaBigVitus would be unfair for the secret classes. Haircuts should be shared though IMO
[1:51:45] <nepwar> noo reggie
[1:51:47] <+IwuzPh34rless> That's the item destroyer

[1:52:02] <andrei11dr> He can tank that magic, that's good

[1:56:49] <%legacy0117> You can't blame the game, unless you are facing an enemy that auto-counters. Which is always the worst.

[1:58:08] <For_Temeria> They don't read chat, no point in backseating
[1:58:09] <%RioGascar> I think the game needs to have balance foe the shop items or something at times
[1:58:09] <+MrRabbles> stop telling the author how to write the manga

[2:06:21] <%Th3SmartAlec> NICE
[2:06:22] <%emperordread> Doge Pope
[2:06:36] <%yeetdabsenpai69> MAGIC DOES NOT MISS IN BATTLE!
[2:06:36] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:06:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> Speed is key.
[2:06:45] <%C24U> You move so fast that everything is going in slow motion, making it easier to hit
[2:06:46] <BallerSwagBro9k> cmonBruh
[2:06:46] <@akuda_bar> Get Touched Forever
[2:06:48] <ShinMaddrox> I wonder if there is a special thing that happens with how much stuff you give the king
[2:06:48] <%Riottrio> well, if Magic also affected field magic accuracy, Magic would actually be the OP stat
[2:06:52] <%Struggleful> !MOTIVATED
[2:06:52] <@Moobot> 1014 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[2:06:55] <%yeetdabsenpai69> y'all still havent seen that
[2:06:56] <%Riottrio> Magic already covers Magic attack+defense
[2:06:58] <RurouniGeo> So stop upping defense and magic and go all speed on your free stats then :)
[2:07:07] <%legacy0117> Minh is too low of karma level to be Sonic. Shadow maybe, but M. Bison has a lot of pyschokinesis tech.
[2:07:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> Sounds like Woolie should just pick a top tier (stat).
[2:07:09] <%yeetdabsenpai69> YEYEYEYEYE
[2:07:09] <%Riottrio> should have made defense affect Magic accuracy
[2:07:15] <andrei11dr> Im surprised Minh actually stopped pumping SP he should keep going
[2:07:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> Oh shit

[2:59:00] <%mrfreezepunsbestpuns> 2.6k
[2:59:01] <%jiggy_snipe> Reggie should have went to that castle 1st then go darkling
[2:59:06] <Zbyrd0961> TAKE MINH'S CONTINENT
[2:59:09] <usurper_sos> Minh is lost in Egypt
[2:59:10] <Shishi1205> That's why I mean by exp diff
[2:59:13] <wendisky> Die with honour
[2:59:19] <tritachyon> LOST IN AFRICA
[2:59:20] <%yeetdabsenpai69> but it wasn't darkling
[2:59:23] <monster343> If he keeps going darkling eventually everyone will even out? LUL
[2:59:25] <RurouniGeo> I still say not going to the new continent first and fucking them up is a bad call. Reggie is solidifying his last place finish if this darkling doesn't work

[2:59:38] <SomersaultJustice> coming at you on a motorcycle
[2:59:45] <%Amaideus> Winning is losing
[2:59:45] <%Riottrio> the worst resolution
[2:59:45] <Archmortal> Reggie has psyched himself out and is gonna put himself deeper in last for the sake of being darkling more than anyone else
[2:59:47] <%Amaideus> Lmao
[2:59:48] <%yeetdabsenpai69> if you lost she would pay off debt
[2:59:48] <%gatorafan> Minh's African adventure

[3:00:47] <crimsonsaens> Can't invest into a castle
[3:00:55] <Shishi1205> If its his castle yes
[3:00:56] <SethKyu> You can, you have to land on it
[3:00:58] <flyingtentaclemonster> !uptime
[3:00:59] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 1 minute
[3:01:01] <Shishi1205> We saw woolie do it today
[3:01:01] <%emperordread> yes you can, you need to physically land on it though @crimsonsaens
[3:01:01] <KRaZyAmmo> can only invest in twons not castle
[3:01:02] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @emeraldskrull not t the right time and no
[3:01:05] <%Th3SmartAlec> Super Spinner
[3:01:08] <KRaZyAmmo> oh
[3:01:11] <Mr_Ease> yeah there are too many towns that are covered in monsters so you won't get much off darkling
[3:01:11] <megamirk> woolie is always in a cave, you could say LUL
[3:01:13] <%jiggy_snipe> not invest per se but boost local item value
[3:01:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yes you can absolutely invest in castles, you have to land on it.
[3:01:14] <Archmortal> Everyone saying you can't invest in castle, Woolie literally did that a few turns ago
[3:01:20] <nepwar> he has nothing to target you with tho
[3:01:24] <megamirk> LUL
[3:01:24] <+Grayhammatter> WOW

[3:01:28] <+Mekhet09> Haha.

[3:01:29] <Shishi1205> ITS A CHANCE
[3:01:31] <siamzero94> just do it
[3:01:31] <lotharrio> SPEND IT
[3:01:32] <nepwar> jesus keep that shit
[3:01:41] <royb2> When an adventurer lands on their own castle, they have the option of investing any amount of money they choose. Invested money does not increase the value of the Castle, but it increases the Local Item value of the Gem it produces. Unlike towns, Castles do not have levels.
[3:01:44] <theredfox930000> woolie will figure it out

[3:10:36] <royb2> @siamzero94 When an adventurer lands on their own castle, they have the option of investing any amount of money they choose. Invested money does not increase the value of the Castle, but it increases the Local Item value of the Gem it produces. Unlike towns, Castles do not have levels.

[3:29:52] <SideChar> it happens cause its cold
[3:29:52] <Idon__> Punched that pixie in the fuckin gut
[3:29:52] <%chickenhunter> the paralysis is because its cold and you dont have the Warm Gloves to stop it
[3:29:55] <%Amaideus> That's what the gloves do?
[3:29:57] <%Irridium> just fucking punch that fairy
[3:29:58] <%Riottrio> better than 5
[3:30:00] <%jiggy_snipe> not a 5
[3:30:07] <%Hawkbone_> I'll take that as a good sign
[3:30:13] <%jiggy_snipe> go back to africa
[3:30:13] <%gatorafan> Reggie can't even last a session without selling his soul to satanas
[3:30:15] <usurper_sos> Just use it
[3:30:18] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> Already doing better
[3:30:20] <%jiggy_snipe> go to the motherland

[3:30:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[3:30:27] <%Riottrio> no-one has any good stuff for resisting darkling anyway
[3:30:29] <%Solidnick18> what
[3:30:29] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> They have no items really
[3:30:29] <RurouniGeo> save your damn points reggie
[3:30:31] <Shishi1205> Go north
[3:30:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> Minh's trying.
[3:30:33] <%VaguelyKai> Reggie has played the behelit three fucking times now. WHAT HERO!?
[3:30:38] <KRaZyAmmo> just take towns
[3:30:50] <+hoenhime344> THIS IS YOURE "hero"
[3:30:51] <%Hawkbone_> Whats wrong with Darkling? Are y'all just afraid of the power?
[3:30:54] <lotharrio> The fact that he can honey dick the behelit and get away with it is what makes him a hero.
[3:30:55] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> Take big money towns
[3:30:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> @vaguelykai And has stumbled over his dick twice, it's too pathetic to be evil.
[3:30:56] <+paladinstarbuster> mihn is going to win so it doesn't matter
[3:30:56] <+mrcooperblack> Baitoven?
[3:31:00] <+Gespens> In the world of Dokapon, there ARE no Heroes
[3:31:01] <evilaltruistic> Steal Minhs towns!

[3:31:03] <%gratedjuice> Mihn the master-baiter
[3:31:03] <mobiusnightshade> Reggie, Sol Goodguy, is the bad guy.
[3:31:04] <Zbyrd0961> take minh's continent at 120
[3:31:06] <%jiggy_snipe> people are afraid of dark powers they dont understand
[3:31:07] <%Th3SmartAlec> Reggie, Mihn is ripe for an asskicking
[3:31:07] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:31:12] <%emperordread> Reggie can only go darkling because he's the underdog - that's why we can root for him
[3:31:15] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> Take south America
[3:31:19] <Dapper_Cactuar> but Woolie lost his items when he died Minh

[3:50:20] <%Pinkiefan> I think he can take the towns manually and use caltrops + ill cartogropho to kill and destroy equipment.
[3:50:21] <%fetrigon> Reggie
[3:50:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> Punished Reggie
[3:50:24] <MaverickJoker> Reggie's heart is Darkening with HATE LUL
[3:50:34] <%saltpiggu> reggie is having an amazing darkling run and not appreciating it at all
[3:50:38] <%Superdandy96> Reggie so punished he got PTSD
[3:50:44] <+Grayhammatter> stonks go down
[3:50:45] <usurper_sos> Barely made a dent
[3:50:46] <%gatorafan> I'd say less hate and more despair
[3:50:49] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> Just do Castle panic.
[3:50:49] <Shishi1205> LUL
[3:50:50] <royb2> reggie needs to steal all of minhs towns
[3:50:51] <%Hawkbone_> Every single time Reggie went Darkling, the game actively fucked him over the hardest of anyone. He gets a free pass to complain about anything he wants
[3:50:51] <%nintega010> 18 towns you have to take those away
[3:50:53] <%derap41> Broken
[3:50:54] <C4m3r0n0409> Woolie is gonna be in last pretty soon

[3:51:44] <BlackMage66652> Colors defeat Minh again
[3:51:45] <%Pinkiefan> The problem is if he steals a castle from Woolie, Minh is completely unaffected.
[3:51:47] <%Amaideus> Global is only worth at the very end
[3:51:48] <%fetrigon> @hawkbone_ Nah last time he could've used local assault to corrupt South America and cripple Minh.
[3:51:51] <%Hawkbone_> South America isn't worth very much this late in the game
[3:51:51] <%Fujiwara_92> color blindness for the win
[3:51:56] <crimsonsaens> We need a global attack to even it out
[3:51:56] <lotharrio> Reggie call them all to you, and break all of Minh's shit. It will cripple him.
[3:51:58] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @crimsonsaens It's called the Shenanigan
[3:52:01] <%jiggy_snipe> not in this economy
[3:52:01] <royb2> castle steal can steal from woolie and leave minh unaffected

[3:53:24] <%nintega010> Cause if Castle panic doesn't steal from Minh it's over
[3:53:30] <+Grayhammatter> CASTLE
[3:53:36] <%Hawkbone_> That was not his first bad roll, he's gotten at least like 4 5's
[3:53:42] <%Amaideus> There's an entire continent none of them have touched
[3:53:45] <Damie904> Walk towards Minh and fight him
[3:53:45] <Shishi1205> get all africa
[3:53:45] <%Th3SmartAlec> Take the town and move on
[3:53:48] <%Amaideus> There's at least 1 more Darkling left
[3:53:56] <%jiggy_snipe> isn't there one town left on Africa?
[3:54:00] <%emperordread> Is Reggie doing a Paige again and not seeing open towns?

[3:55:59] <Shishi1205> you have a 2 crystal
[3:56:01] <%bread_assassin> That just seems needlessly excessive. Like each of those needs a relation with all of the others.

[4:07:04] <+TetsuyaD> @Superdandy96 down under
[4:07:05] <%emperordread> Reggie won't earn DAHK AHTZ points until he accepts the darkness
[4:07:08] <+hoenhime344> @usurper_sos the towns in the forest are not worth alot. basically he needs to take 2-3 towns to equal 1 town on a higher level continent
[4:07:23] <Mrthefro> Hey honey, time for your daily 5 roll.
[4:07:28] <%nintega010> Darklington is best Darkling

[4:07:47] <MaverickJoker> @emperordread Have you seen the light in Reggie's eyes fading away? I think he's close

[4:08:12] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[4:08:14] <+Grayhammatter> wow
[4:08:14] <%Javaa01> Minh will have to settle for electrostimulation
[4:08:16] <%Amaideus> Or he can just take a castle, which is immediate profit that can't be taken away easily
[4:08:18] <%yeetdabsenpai69> double shot

[4:10:02] <+poodo89> no he doesn't
[4:10:05] <%nintega010> In the lead with one castle hmmm

[4:10:32] <%yeetdabsenpai69> PREPARE FOR COME HERE
[4:10:32] <+hoenhime344> @Jetzord no. thats why ive been saying is unfair to pick on minh. he may be in first, but his charavter is the weakest AND he has the lest safe net worth
[4:10:34] <ooooorangejuice> regge abandon his Continent pkan
[4:10:35] <%Hawkbone_> I remember Yukon is the one that launched Reggie into first, and the one Darklington stole from him
[4:10:36] <%Amaideus> Minh's so far in the lead because he's had low value towns for real life weeks
[4:10:37] <hamahiroyuki> aim for mihn's towns
[4:10:38] <glass_marcus> This is gonna sound racist but
[4:10:44] <DaBigVitus> go for minh, take his castle
[4:10:44] <WizardofWazz> id go to egypt and start taking towns to boost castle value
[4:10:48] <Ultimatefool> All those blue heads? That's why Minh is winning LUL
[4:10:50] <Reizie_Etherealm> 2 and a half continents of towns LUL
[4:10:58] <Maleicus> ?????
[4:11:00] <DaBigVitus> you can take a players castle as darkling right? if you kill them
[4:11:02] <+poodo89> why did he go for castle? that was not a good play
[4:11:05] <C4m3r0n0409> Minh is the only one playing. smart
[4:11:05] <%kingkeldeo31> kill minh
[4:11:10] <Shishi1205> Woolie has to hole ass and get the new continent
[4:11:12] <+CasketCat> Been catching up on the anime, and I'm here for the manga now.

[4:11:41] <C4m3r0n0409> WOOLIE YOU ARE PROBABLY IN LAST
[4:11:41] <%legacy0117> Nice Cat. Welcome to the salt journey.
[4:11:44] <Shishi1205> A better shield maybe? Rust?
[4:11:49] <+hoenhime344> @Ultimatefool but its not reliable net worth. its the same as renting out 15 office spaces. 1 darkling roll on global assult and its all over
[4:11:49] <%Th3SmartAlec> Run Woolie, run
[4:11:57] <%yeetdabsenpai69> not last!
[4:11:57] <%jiggy_snipe> castles are hard to take, they have only transfered hands via darkling
[4:11:59] <%Amaideus> @DaBigVitus Items, temples, magic, banks
[4:12:00] <%yeetdabsenpai69> Poggers
[4:12:02] <+poodo89> @th3smartalec I meant in general, no reason to spend points on taking a random castle instead of saving up and taking all the towns
[4:12:04] <%nintega010> look at that
[4:12:10] <%Amaideus> It doesn't take them!
[4:12:15] <%Amaideus> It removes them

[4:12:20] <Gorshum> LUL
[4:12:22] <+hoenhime344> @poodo89 i hyper disagree.

[4:12:22] <+MrRabbles> Minh's lead is so strong

[4:12:24] <%Fujiwara_92> LUL PJSalt
[4:12:25] <%Amaideus> He would have to manually go to all of them to take them
[4:12:25] <%emperordread> @Shishi1205 Rust will never work in Reggies hands, Woolie already has a read on him

[4:18:31] <%gatorafan> at this point one has to wonder if there has been more Darkling turns for Reggie than regular onea

[4:20:10] <+paladinstarbuster> footnotes are better
[4:20:11] <%CommanderSqueaks> Can't he get Minh?
[4:20:14] <%Th3SmartAlec> @nelsonsaysbooya Debating whether to sabotage himself from getting items
[4:20:19] <%yeetdabsenpai69> MINH
[4:20:19] <%Th3SmartAlec> WHY
[4:20:21] <Shishi1205> Yeah can you dodge?
[4:20:22] <+Pinkiefan> It's set lower because caltrops lasts a full week and item seal only lasts what, two turns?
[4:20:22] <+hoenhime344> @emperordread last i checked minh has NEVER accepted darkness into his heart. Reggie did it 3 times
[4:20:23] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1255023082869272576
[4:20:27] <%yeetdabsenpai69> COULDA GOTTEN MINH
[4:20:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> ....
[4:20:30] <OldManDeckardCain> Prayers for rollback are always delayed LUL

[4:20:37] <%yeknomlive> @yeetdabsenpai69 what are you talking about ive done it before
[4:20:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> Reggie, you are the dumbest boy....
[4:20:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> I'm still on this train though.
[4:20:46] <%emperordread> @hoenhime344 Reggie merely adopted the dark. Minh was born in it, raised in it
[4:20:47] <%gatorafan> @oldmandeckardcain fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu daedra1CryingTibs daedra1LaughingTibs
[4:20:51] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @yeildingthought then you are misremembering
[4:20:53] <%fetrigon> Could he have gotten Minh?
[4:20:57] <%Hawkbone_> Going after Minh would be less useful than getting closer to Australia
[4:20:57] <%Chatterbox1991> Minh Range
[4:20:57] <%nintega010> god minh
[4:20:58] <+hoenhime344> @emperordread if it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, and STEALS DUCKS its a villain
[4:21:04] <%fetrigon> He didn't even check...
[4:21:05] <QuestionableDes> Did Reggie Pick Global?
[4:21:06] <royb2> Through this darkling, Minhs lead was INCREASED
[4:21:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> @hawkbone_ Could have stolen a castle
[4:21:08] <+MrRabbles> Minh's solid lead continues
[4:21:08] <QuestionableDes> I was on a call
[4:21:15] <%emperordread> @CommanderSqueaks You and me both. Reggie is a big dumb butt, but he's OUR big dumb butt
[4:21:18] <+eanscrale> MinhMAX
[4:21:18] <usurper_sos> No he took a castle
[4:21:19] <%Hawkbone_> @CommanderSqueaks He did
[4:21:24] <%Fujiwara_92> was he?
[4:21:25] <C4m3r0n0409> Reggie is bad at Darkling
[4:21:25] <%Th3SmartAlec> Spin
[4:21:26] <+poodo89> he was and then Reggie salty backed down
[4:21:28] <C4m3r0n0409> Like terrible
[4:21:31] <maznuts> MinhMAXING
[4:21:33] <%legacy0117> Reggie as Darkling? More like sapling.
[4:21:33] <QuestionableDes> the fuck Reggie
[4:21:34] <%jiggy_snipe> Reggie got 1 castle so that's fine
[4:21:38] <%Pinkiefan> Wow vanish works on dark arts. That's powerful.
[4:21:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> @hawkbone_ He stole Woolie's castle, he could have taken Minh's castle from killing him.
[4:21:42] <%Th3SmartAlec> LULU
[4:21:54] <Shishi1205> Vanish might be the best item to avoid bs
[4:21:58] <MaverickJoker> I'm with Minh for most of the part, but whoever is the Darkling and accepts the salt distribution always has my back Kappa
[4:21:59] <%alpacasintophats> TASTE THE BLOOD
[4:22:00] <%Hawkbone_> @C4m3r0n0409 How the fuck is he bad at darkling? The game is actively fucking him over, its not his fault he gets bad rolls
[4:22:04] <Damie904> He can't take Woolie's castle. It's Rng. The game keeps avoiding minh's castle.
[4:22:14] <%Jetzord> @CommanderSqueaks I don't think Minh's castle is worth very much though
[4:22:14] <%Hawkbone_> @CommanderSqueaks Castle Panic is the only way to steal castles.
[4:22:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> YES Blood chest
[4:22:30] <C4m3r0n0409> @Hawkbone_ SAVE FOR GLOBAL ASSAULT
[4:22:31] <+Vigonept> you dint get castles from kills
[4:22:35] <%jiggy_snipe> Woolie has more castles so it makes sense to take his, higher chances
[4:22:35] <%legacy0117> His luck is TERRIBLE.
[4:22:38] <%Hawkbone_> @C4m3r0n0409 Castles are more important
[4:22:41] <nelsonsaysbooya> If Reggie commited to hunting down Mihn he could've killed him AND started goomba stomping his towns
[4:22:45] <C4m3r0n0409> Not really
[4:22:47] <%jiggy_snipe> @C4m3r0n0409 castles are more important
[4:22:47] <Damie904> The optimal move was robbing Minh of his towns and I dont think Reggie could've hit 200 points at any point.
[4:22:48] <%Th3SmartAlec> @CommanderSqueaks Do they know that?
[4:22:49] <+poodo89> it's not, should have saved and destroyed towns
[4:22:52] <C4m3r0n0409> Reggie is still in last
[4:22:56] <Idon__> holy SHIT
[4:22:58] <Idon__> man got SHOT
[4:23:01] <C4m3r0n0409> It wouldve evened up everyone

[4:23:12] <C4m3r0n0409> How
[4:23:13] <QuestionableDes> Just saying Minh has invested a lot in town, going Global and fucking over that flow then doing COME HERE would have sealed his fate

[4:23:29] <megamirk> reggie_sees_feet.sfx
[4:23:29] <%legacy0117> Reggie'as luck only works when he gambles, then some punks him out of his winnings. Everytime.
[4:23:31] <xdeathknightx> time to switch to porn, it is easier to explain Kappa
[4:23:32] <%yeetdabsenpai69> WE KNOW THE TRUTH
[4:23:33] <Damie904> and the ones he could reach are all behind pathways that go off the map. Too much time to reach them I guess.

[4:24:05] <Camail> Reggie is an actual dumb
[4:24:11] <%CommanderSqueaks> Reggie, wake me up inside.
[4:24:15] <C4m3r0n0409> Woolie was almost caught up with Reggie
[4:24:18] <Idon__> KAH GEY
[4:24:18] <C4m3r0n0409> Minh
[4:24:21] <QuestionableDes> CANT WAKE UP
[4:24:25] <%gatorafan> Ryu just has heated fighter moments
[4:24:26] <%Hawkbone_> @C4m3r0n0409 Besides, he likely wouldn't be able to get 200 anyway
[4:24:26] <C4m3r0n0409> He was almost back in first dude
[4:24:29] <%jiggy_snipe> @C4m3r0n0409 actually Woolie used Global Assault and Castle Panic on that turn
[4:24:32] <jubejube56> We all know SF6 will have Evil Kage

[4:25:39] <%jiggy_snipe> until the game is almost over, towns aren't important because they can still change hands

[4:30:18] <%Th3SmartAlec> You sure you don't want some spells
[4:30:19] <evilaltruistic> how Reggie was as a Darkling? I missed
[4:30:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> @evilaltruistic So did he
[4:30:30] <C4m3r0n0409> @evilaltruistic He sucked
[4:30:32] <+Mekhet09> Did Reggie use castle panic?
[4:30:35] <%Amaideus> It was an average darkling turn
[4:30:35] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @evilaltruistic bad again
[4:30:37] <evilaltruistic> Reggiiiiiiiie
[4:30:39] <%legacy0117> Awful.
[4:30:43] <+MrAtheGreat> @evilaltruistic He stole a castle. No one died.
[4:30:44] <%Th3SmartAlec> @evilaltruistic He didn;t get lucky with rolls at all
[4:30:45] <C4m3r0n0409> He did still in last
[4:30:47] <%Amaideus> And whether it was good or not depends on how much you value castles over towns
[4:30:47] <%Kriss1827> if woolie grts all these towns, stonks go up
[4:30:50] <Shishi1205> Big MG
[4:30:50] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @Amaideus "average"
[4:30:51] <WizardofWazz> 999
[4:30:52] <Shishi1205> Big HP
[4:30:52] <%xcompleasedad> Reggie stole one of Woolie's Castles
[4:30:55] <Junkles> M Kreygasm i Kreygasm n Kreygasm h Kreygasm t Kreygasm h Kreygasm e Kreygasm h Kreygasm e Kreygasm r Kreygasm o
[4:31:02] <+Grayhammatter> big magic, bigget hp
[4:31:02] <crimsonsaens> Shop
[4:31:05] <Akett> Any time a darkling wipes the board of towns Minh just plays Pacman with towns as dots.
[4:31:05] <%Fujiwara_92> 999
[4:31:10] <%Pinkiefan> @evilaltruistic he did about the same. Stole a castle back, but that doesn't stop Minh.
[4:31:12] <thatsmapizza2> you should get some new magic spells, Woolie. Drain has really low base damage
[4:31:13] <KRaZyAmmo> yeah you'll need them weapons lol
[4:31:13] <nelsonsaysbooya> In 3 combine Darkling attempts Reggie has failed to be as impactful as Wollie's 1st time
[4:31:19] <$StaceMcGate> get dem weapons
[4:31:22] <WizardofWazz> thats just income not value
[4:31:25] <%legacy0117> At least he got to punch Minh in the teeth at the beginning of his Darklingdom.
[4:31:26] <%Amaideus> Woolie got nuts rolls on his first time though
[4:31:28] <%agumon9000> Its how much it makes a day
[4:31:32] <%Hawkbone_> @nelsonsaysbooya Because he got fucked over. Not his fault.
[4:31:32] <%Riottrio> needs money still to afford weapons
[4:31:37] <%Amaideus> He got like, 360 points or something ridiculous
[4:31:44] <Mr_Ease> honestly the golem boss is the weakest one
[4:31:49] <crimsonsaens> Get a magic spell and fry the golems
[4:31:51] <nelsonsaysbooya> The rolls ain't his fault, his pathing is.
[4:31:52] <%Amaideus> At least 340
[4:31:56] <DaBigVitus> income hardly matters no?
[4:31:58] <Shishi1205> Go for it?
[4:32:02] <%yeetdabsenpai69> that DF
[4:32:02] <+poodo89> thickums
[4:32:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie should be focusing on who he should kill safer
[4:32:04] <Klefth> Might want magic before you fight that big boi
[4:32:07] <%Hawkbone_> @nelsonsaysbooya He didn't have bad pathing
[4:32:10] <+Grayhammatter> gonna need a better weapon woolz
[4:32:11] <%yeetdabsenpai69> noooo
[4:32:12] <%nintega010> Strike
[4:32:13] <%Th3SmartAlec> ...
[4:32:18] <nepwar> mistakes being made?
[4:32:20] <BurningSaph> YEYEYEYE
[4:32:21] <Shishi1205> Lets see him try
[4:32:23] <+Grayhammatter> mistakes
[4:32:24] <crimsonsaens> Reggie definitely had awful pathing
[4:32:24] <$StaceMcGate> mistakes were made
[4:32:24] <+poodo89> o
[4:32:25] <Klefth> ...You're fucked

[4:32:30] <%yeetdabsenpai69> strike!
[4:32:32] <Mr_Ease> the boss will replace the little monsters anyway so if you take the town fighting the weak ones you'll lose them
[4:32:32] <Shishi1205> Drain?
[4:32:34] <%Pinkiefan> A level 6 town with good local item value is about equal to a castle, but towns are easy to lose.
[4:32:34] <%Th3SmartAlec> DRAIN
[4:32:36] <+aishman> STRIKE
[4:32:36] <%legacy0117> Awesome design!

[4:33:31] <Klefth> The luck of this fool...
[4:33:32] <mrblack499> how many turns are left
[4:33:43] <%Hawkbone_> @mrblack499 Thats not how it works
[4:33:48] <%Pinkiefan> until it's done
[4:33:56] <$legacy0117> I hope there's a monster that spans strikes.
[4:34:00] <%Th3SmartAlec> One of these days
[4:34:02] <%legacy0117> spams*
[4:34:03] <usurper_sos> He's just gonna take all his towns back LUL
[4:34:08] <%xcompleasedad> Calling it: Rico Jr Steals all of the towns as the last act
[4:34:09] <%Th3SmartAlec> The game will not be on Minh's side
[4:34:10] <phatmac16> BERSERCAR
[4:34:13] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @legacy0117 no :(
[4:34:18] <%nintega010> man I remember the Runaway guys getting to the last island, but they had like the best weapon or 1 of the best classes.
[4:34:23] <$StaceMcGate> Did Minh ever get his acrobat item?
[4:34:24] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:34:25] <crimsonsaens> Minh is farming job exp
[4:34:28] <mrblack499> so never lol
[4:34:28] <%Fujiwara_92> PRECIOUSTONE
[4:34:29] <%legacy0117> Aw why not?
[4:34:32] <%Th3SmartAlec> Yes, get closer to items
[4:34:38] <+Grayhammatter> grind, get those towns
[4:34:40] <%legacy0117> Lame.
[4:34:43] <C4m3r0n0409> Minh doesn't have acrobat yet
[4:34:45] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @nintega010 i know and they kept going for each other to get stuff from each other
[4:34:48] <%Riottrio> @nintega010 yeah, they spent a lot more time exploring in chapter 5-6
[4:34:52] <%yeetdabsenpai69> they weren't COWARDS
[4:34:52] <%fetrigon> invest and then item shop
[4:34:58] <%Pinkiefan> @StaceMcGate That's what he's using. Hasn't unlocked the class yet, though.
[4:35:02] <nelsonsaysbooya> Reg needs to try to grind on cities in the next few turns.
[4:35:04] <+Mekhet09> Reggie could come back if he just took those towns and ignored the current continent.
[4:35:08] <nelsonsaysbooya> Could get him backin the game
[4:35:24] <C4m3r0n0409> Reggie take these towns
[4:35:24] <%Riottrio> bank space then item shop would be best bet
[4:35:27] <$StaceMcGate> @Pinkiefan needs to get magician to lvl 6 and then go to Dokapon castle?
[4:35:28] <usurper_sos> You don't have that many options
[4:35:30] <Shishi1205> ez bank
[4:35:31] <WizardofWazz> LUL
[4:35:32] <%Riottrio> then hr can easily hit towns
[4:35:34] <DaBigVitus> lmao SAYS WOOLIE

[4:36:02] <%nintega010> @Riottrio ch 5-6 I think they all kind of agreed to do the content thing for awhile. But it means the end game on this play through will be harder
[4:36:05] <thesickestzak> Woolies the one that talk
[4:36:06] <%xcompleasedad> WE did
[4:36:09] <C4m3r0n0409> STRIKE
[4:36:11] <%gatorafan> Can Reggie liberate the continent he conquered himself? Kappa
[4:36:15] <Shishi1205> Does strike kill?
[4:36:17] <usurper_sos> STRIKE
[4:36:18] <%Solidnick18> strike
[4:36:20] <HarmlessCrow> DARLINGTON
[4:36:20] <thesickestzak> Don't worry. The universe did
[4:36:24] <Shishi1205> Nah correct play
[4:36:24] <WizardofWazz> do these monster auto-counter?
[4:36:25] <%Pinkiefan> Yeah, but I think there's still another class to master before acrobat.
[4:36:26] <%Tearonex> He says not looking at the chat
[4:36:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> Nice
[4:36:30] <+poodo89> eh

[4:36:35] <%legacy0117> Reggie, gamble everything at the Casino, it is literally the only chance you have if you don't warp to the new area.
[4:36:35] <C4m3r0n0409> kill him

[4:37:02] <HarmlessCrow> Does Minh have NEGATIVE gold?
[4:37:06] <%jiggy_snipe> yes
[4:37:07] <yodajr99> yep
[4:37:10] <%Amaideus> Minh's super in debt

[4:40:37] <Shishi1205> He is bllind?
[4:40:41] <%jiggy_snipe> his eyes are closed Woolie
[4:40:44] <lotharrio> Hey, this dog has a lot to do!
[4:40:47] <%Javaa01> I mean, granted, he never opens his eyes
[4:40:49] <Mr_Ease> tourmaline has no function
[4:40:51] <%Solidnick18> blind doggo
[4:40:52] <%legacy0117> Touramine is a type of gem.
[4:40:53] <%fetrigon> He can sell tourmaline in case Dokapon happens.
[4:40:57] <xXxPS9xXx> they haven't killed each other yet? that's amazing

[4:41:12] <+MrAtheGreat> To be fair dogs have pretty terrible vision
[4:41:21] <Shishi1205> Why would the castle give you a bad item
[4:41:25] <DaBigVitus> two leggers LUL
[4:41:26] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:41:26] <%legacy0117> Also, fan opinion, is Dog priest blind?
[4:41:29] <%gatorafan> but that allows him to be impartial with his blessings and judgement
[4:41:30] <%GrassCannon> he should recognize them by smell then
[4:41:30] <%SammyOVision> Castles are always good items though
[4:41:32] <%GrassCannon> wtf
[4:41:34] <%Amaideus> I feel like that means if you get hit with fire it paralyzes you
[4:41:36] <usurper_sos> It is a good item
[4:41:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> Reggie
[4:41:40] <%Riottrio> Dog priest has fluff covering eyes is canon
[4:41:41] <%jiggy_snipe> you got it from a castle so its probably good

[4:41:53] <Shishi1205> THE CHOKE
[4:41:55] <%jiggy_snipe> ?
[4:41:55] <%Pinkiefan> Ugh, naive, trusting Reggie.
[4:41:57] <%Rhinoprotoss> WAT
[4:41:58] <lotharrio> "It's no surprise to me, I am my own worst enemy..."
[4:42:00] <SethKyu> two tanks fighting it out
[4:42:01] <Klefth> WHY
[4:42:03] <Klefth> WHYY
[4:42:05] <%yeknomlive> but whytho
[4:42:05] <%Livelinne> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[4:42:05] <Junkles> team reggie: scared of everything, fearful of nothing
[4:42:08] <Shishi1205> Attack would have killed
[4:42:09] <%Riottrio> Woolie's overthinking gotten to Reggie, but selling for ready cash isn't terrible
[4:42:11] <%fetrigon> Castles don't give bad items Reggie. That doesn't even make sense from a game design standpoint.
[4:42:12] <Klefth> YOU HAD IT
[4:42:14] <C4m3r0n0409> Couldve won
[4:42:14] <%Th3SmartAlec> ....The one time you were GUARENTEED TO WIN
[4:42:15] <+zepelinnn1> he could heal after tjp
[4:42:15] <BurningSaph> big fight
[4:42:17] <%Pinkiefan> He believes everything Minh says.
[4:42:17] <+PulsinFufu> inochiThink you get something good by giving stuff to the king?
[4:42:17] <DaBigVitus> attack absolutely would have killed
[4:42:21] <%emperordread> Reggie: Spends a week not being darkling so he can invest in his castle items. Also Reggie: I don't know I don't trust these items that my castles gave me woolieREGGIEFUL
[4:42:23] <nepwar> unless it dodged it. heal was safe option
[4:42:23] <+poodo89> hmmmmm
[4:42:25] <+zepelinnn1> i hope the golem kills woolie now
[4:42:27] <%nintega010> to casino
[4:42:28] <crimsonsaens> Groat
[4:42:32] <Shishi1205> Attack dealt 100 easy last time
[4:42:35] <Shishi1205> he had 70
[4:42:37] <+IwuzPh34rless> ... Y U NO ATTACK TearGlove
[4:42:42] <Shishi1205> Easiest attack of a lifetime
[4:42:44] <jubejube56> @nepwar Lol that golem wasn't exactly looking very agile
[4:42:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> @emperordread It's almost as if they have a manual next to them that they could refer to for information.
[4:42:47] <%chickenhunter> the guys really need to start using the Prediction button more
[4:42:51] <%Livelinne> Danube!
[4:42:54] <nubreakable> Oh man the Manga used to be so cool with all those smart and well thought out characters LUL
[4:42:58] <nepwar> @jubejube56 doesn't mean there isn't a chance
[4:43:01] <Camail> holy fuck, relax
[4:43:04] <%Riottrio> @shishi1205 misses are still a thing, so ot was the safer option (even though dodging golem was super unlikely)
[4:43:07] <Mr_Ease> @PulsinFufu Local item value based on the value of what you sell, its a money value that folks can't mess with added at the end of the game
[4:43:08] <C4m3r0n0409> Minh plays so smart its greaty
[4:43:11] <%eyezehuhh> how's the friendship? still intact?
[4:43:12] <Shishi1205> His Sp is pretty garbo
[4:43:26] <irfan_> god this volume went absolutely everywhere lmao
[4:43:26] <%jiggy_snipe> @Shishi1205 true but if he missed LUL
[4:43:28] <%Riottrio> it is, but we've seen bigger gaps with dodges before
[4:43:32] <%Tearonex> Guys let Woolie live in cowardice, it's the only thing that's keeping him in this
[4:43:32] <C4m3r0n0409> Friendship is intact because noone is close to Minh
[4:43:33] <+Grayhammatter> jesus
[4:43:34] <%gatorafan> waow
[4:43:35] <%fetrigon> pffffft
[4:43:36] <mrblack499> this game is going to be long lol,layno!

[4:43:55] <nubreakable> someones said the game ends after chapter 8, can someone confirm?
[4:43:55] <%Pinkiefan> @nubreakable This is the worst arc. Different writer. Lots of dumb decisions by the characters.
[4:43:59] <WizardofWazz> get on ya knees and pray boy
[4:44:03] <$GenerallyAHorriblePerson> Team Minh is prolly the best written character this arc
[4:44:05] <+Vigonept> darkling 4 incoming
[4:44:06] <%chickenhunter> this isnt the last chapter
[4:44:08] <%fetrigon> @pinkiefan LUL
[4:44:13] <nubreakable> @Pinkiefan LUL
[4:44:16] <Shishi1205> What woolie needs to do is to get a better weapon or to use magic offensively
[4:44:25] <$GenerallyAHorriblePerson> Actively sabotaging the foolish team Reggie
[4:44:26] <+PulsinFufu> inochiThink also how do you win?
[4:44:28] <%legacy0117> The writers change every week, cut them some slack.

[4:45:34] <%viewtifulr> you should catching up to minh speed
[4:45:34] <%legacy0117> Casino cash money always an option due to that fact.

[4:46:13] <BurningSaph> Danube, Danube never changes
[4:46:14] <%Riottrio> this fukken worm

[4:46:15] <+MrAtheGreat> “Which one?!”
[4:46:15] <Klefth> Your OWNER LUL
[4:46:16] <crimsonsaens> Danube is freed, for now
[4:46:17] <royb2> all those cities reggie remonstered? Minh will just take them all
[4:46:17] <%Pinkiefan> So Woolie can easily take first if he just takes over the new continent and invest in one town a bunch.
[4:46:19] <%xcompleasedad> Gaza in this bitch
[4:46:21] <%gatorafan> At this point Danube shouldn't even exist
[4:46:22] <Shishi1205> If you kill a player and take a town do you chose it? Is it one only? how does that work? We haven't seen it yet
[4:46:24] <%Livelinne> LUL LUL LUL
[4:46:25] <%yeknomlive> maybe this worm is a proper leader for danube
[4:46:27] <%jiggy_snipe> like a gun

[4:46:53] <%gatorafan> @graxe_ peace was never an option for Danube

[4:47:53] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Riottrio It can be worthless if you don't save any of the towns on that continent

[4:50:57] <%yeetdabsenpai69> hes broke
[4:51:00] <Decimated_body> Reggie the new SALTY BITCH
[4:51:00] <+thebeargoesHONK> suprised Woolie didn't go for the big guy
[4:51:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> @nubreakable Look at it this way, it's the perfect time to get coffee or take a bio break.
[4:51:03] <Reizie_Etherealm> Minh being a heel seems to have the opposite effect of what's intended. Instead of rallying the other 2 to stomp his ass, it seems to make them discouraged instead
[4:51:06] <%yeknomlive> phew
[4:51:08] <crossing_mao> Mihn “Gut Punch Uggos” T.
[4:51:08] <%nintega010> strike

[4:51:23] <%jiggy_snipe> @Hawkbone_ Reggies 2nd darkling was really bad, he could have messed them both up when they were on Danube
[4:51:24] <C4m3r0n0409> LUL
[4:51:25] <Shishi1205> THAT?S THA BOY
[4:51:27] <+poodo89> good shit bro
[4:51:28] <%Th3SmartAlec> Ok Minh, stick to that
[4:51:33] <%Hawkbone_> @jiggy_snipe He id.
[4:51:34] <Niney_Who> Woolie, Queen of Australia
[4:51:37] <%Hawkbone_> did*
[4:51:44] <jubejube56> One day they will see that Heckfire isn't magic
[4:51:46] <DaBigVitus> where's the next big monster?
[4:51:49] <MaverickJoker> Of course, Australia is the inhospitable area. LUL
[4:51:50] <%Riottrio> Minh is totally gonna lose first place (at least temporarily) if he never Goes there
[4:51:51] <%Solidnick18> so humble of minh to do that
[4:51:52] <%nintega010> Australia would be the hardest continent
[4:51:52] <flyingtentaclemonster> SHO-RYU-KEN PogChamp
[4:51:56] <%Livelinne> Tank Magical Girl woolieCHAN
[4:52:01] <+Grayhammatter> minh getting further in the lead
[4:52:02] <+thebeargoesHONK> big monster is 6 from Woolie
[4:52:07] <%Riottrio> all those magic drop bears in Australia
[4:52:11] <%Th3SmartAlec> @flyingtentaclemonster I felt real dumb when I notiched Ryu and Ken are in that
[4:52:22] <KRaZyAmmo> 22/23 towns
[4:52:26] <%Superbro64> It wouldnt be a game of risk if someone didnt hold up HUNDREDS of units in Australia
[4:52:30] <%Riottrio> loving Minh actually wanting tobbe countered is
[4:52:36] <+paladinstarbuster> Should kill minh for the charm potion
[4:52:42] <$Noponiz> counter is based on YOUR attack, so yes they owuld easily kill
[4:52:43] <+Grayhammatter> yeyeyeye
[4:52:47] <$GenerallyAHorriblePerson> It’s like the game is actively making itself more bullshit to help Minh
[4:52:48] <%yeknomlive> here's a tip chat: counters always kill
[4:52:49] <Maleicus> absolutely would kill
[4:52:55] <%Riottrio> kill Minh fot satisfaction
[4:52:57] <%yeknomlive> you can counter a darkling and it will kill
[4:53:00] <DaBigVitus> @Th3SmartAlec so SF6 needs a shoto named Sho
[4:53:04] <Shishi1205> Counter don't kill full health woolie tho
[4:53:08] <%legacy0117> Well, whoever wins, even if Minh Bison wins, still will make for a great story.
[4:53:09] <%Superbro64> @yeknomlive press x to doubt
[4:53:17] <$Noponiz> because woolie has way more bulk than attack
[4:53:18] <%Fujiwara_92> Big X
[4:53:18] <Maleicus> yes it will
[4:53:22] <$GenerallyAHorriblePerson> Counter doesn’t always kill
[4:53:28] <+poodo89> @superbro64 that's very true my man
[4:53:36] <+Gespens> Counter does damage based off of the attackers attack stat, I think
[4:53:38] <hectic_harlequin> Oh for a sec I thought it was just the head LUL
[4:53:40] <%Superbro64> chat cant decide I see sajamSegue4
[4:53:43] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @Superbro64 its true it is the strikers damage but doubled so a darklin superdies
[4:53:52] <%Riottrio> @gespens based off attack magic and speed
[4:53:59] <+netrac> how is the bloodpool?
[4:54:05] <Shishi1205> Woolie please the weapons
[4:54:07] <%Riottrio> @gespens well,strike, and counter just reverses the damage
[4:54:09] <%Pinkiefan> If Woolie takes Parramatta and invests to lvl 6, then takes the castle, it'll be worth 7.2 million.
[4:54:10] <asd2897> all part of the plan
[4:54:11] <+hoenhime344> reggie killing his OWN MEN. IS THIS YOUR HERO @TEAMREGGIE
[4:54:12] <usurper_sos> Reggie the Apostle

[4:54:36] <%JetpackMcQuack> GivePLZ Hero
[4:54:36] <lotharrio> @hoenhime344 Yes. He understands the sacrifices that need to be made.
[4:54:41] <+hoenhime344> Pathetic, all of you
[4:54:41] <%nintega010> Giga Blaze would kill Minh
[4:54:42] <%Jetzord> @hoenhime344 that's correct, yes
[4:54:46] <Shishi1205> I think drain will forever be better for woolie as ofensive magic
[4:54:47] <%yeetdabsenpai69> sleepy into strike?YEYEYEYEYEYE
[4:54:49] <Decimated_body> #tEAM mINH
[4:54:49] <%Th3SmartAlec> lectro is real good
[4:54:52] <+Gespens> GIGA BLAZE PogChamp
[4:55:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> @shishi1205 When he has heal tho it's redundant.
[4:55:04] <%Superdandy96> At least Reggie admits his mistakes and dosent go a 50 min explanation for why he did what he did Kappa
[4:55:06] <%alpacasintophats> yo that giga blaze would straight up make minh die
[4:55:06] <%kingkeldeo31> Become the big Magic boy Woolie
[4:55:07] <Klefth> Spells tho
[4:55:10] <Shishi1205> Kinda redudant
[4:55:11] <%jiggy_snipe> if Woolie got giga blaze, would he be unstoppable?
[4:55:12] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @Shishi1205 nah the others magic stat is s bad he can se good magic to onehit them
[4:55:18] <Daba_mk2> Reggie"youngling slayer"Skywaker
[4:55:18] <+MrAtheGreat> tgese guys are just going to be a massive pain unless you have the proper equipment to match them. Plus you get stronger than minh/rge
[4:55:20] <nubreakable> what you guys think, will the blood pool ultimately corrupt their friendship when this comes to an end
[4:55:21] <$GenerallyAHorriblePerson> Reggie is the worst darkling
[4:55:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> @superdandy96 Let me explain my though process.
[4:55:24] <hectic_harlequin> Damn
[4:55:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> **thought
[4:55:28] <Shishi1205> Magic then
[4:55:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> fuck
[4:55:31] <%nintega010> giga blaze
[4:55:31] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:55:32] <%kingkeldeo31> gold space
[4:55:32] <+Grayhammatter> magic then
[4:55:32] <KRaZyAmmo> get magic
[4:55:34] <+poodo89> get the blaze get the blaze
[4:55:34] <%yeetdabsenpai69> magic second best choice
[4:55:34] <crimsonsaens> Magic Store for golems
[4:55:34] <+MrAtheGreat> Item store?
[4:55:37] <+aishman> TOYN
[4:55:38] <%jiggy_snipe> @yeetdabsenpai69 Reggie has also leveled his magic
[4:55:38] <nepwar> magic defense x is there
[4:55:41] <Klefth> MAGIC
[4:55:47] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @jiggy_snipe but not enough
[4:55:50] <crimsonsaens> DX is so good
[4:55:51] <WizardofWazz> need that dx
[4:55:57] <%Riottrio> @yeetdabsenpai69 Reggie's magic stat 8s close to Woolie's, but it would be effective until he upgrades from default magic defense
[4:55:59] <+fettsvett201> !motivated
[4:55:59] <@Moobot> 1020 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[4:56:00] <Maleicus> dx is too good
[4:56:01] <%Superdandy96> @commandersqueaks allow me to explain my counter point to your misspelling Kappa
[4:56:02] <%emperordread> Purr furr
[4:56:04] <hectic_harlequin> "Y'know, like nya" - Crysta, probably
[4:56:08] <maznuts> !motivated
[4:56:08] <@Moobot> 1021 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[4:56:12] <%yeetdabsenpai69> and i don't think he has a good enough defensive mg
[4:56:15] <crimsonsaens> Buy M Guard DX
[4:56:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> @superdandy96 It is what it is.
[4:56:21] <KRaZyAmmo> M guard
[4:56:24] <KRaZyAmmo> DX
[4:56:24] <%emperordread> Thank Mew
[4:56:26] <nepwar> gigaaa blazze
[4:56:26] <+MrAtheGreat> GIGA SOUNDS SO GOOD
[4:56:27] <%Riottrio> exactly, defensive magic really matters
[4:56:28] <hectic_harlequin> Grab that shit
[4:56:29] <usurper_sos> Giga Blaze
[4:56:31] <+poodo89> get the blaze get the blaze
[4:56:32] <%Superdandy96> @commandersqueaks let’s agree to disagree
[4:56:34] <%Th3SmartAlec> lectro is better I believe?
[4:56:35] <%heroversusofficial> GIGARU BLAHZE
[4:56:36] <$Noponiz> lectro beam does more damage than giga blaze
[4:56:38] <%JeoDood> lectro beam
[4:56:38] <%yeetdabsenpai69> if they don' magic defend*
[4:56:38] <+Mekhet09> lectro is better.
[4:56:39] <maznuts> GIGA BLAZE IT
[4:56:43] <%kingkeldeo31> Electro beam
[4:56:44] <+zepelinnn1> Banish with heal has VALUE
[4:56:44] <%nintega010> Giga Blaze or Lectro beam
[4:56:45] <%Amaideus> "if successful"
[4:56:47] <irfan_> minh is SO FUCKED
[4:56:47] <crimsonsaens> Lectro is better, but more expensive
[4:56:48] <Shishi1205> Lectro is better then
[4:56:49] <$StaceMcGate> LECTO BEAM
[4:56:53] <%Amaideus> That sounds like it has a chance
[4:56:56] <%yeetdabsenpai69> ELECTRO BEAM! YEYEYE
[4:57:00] <%JeoDood> lectro eam is better
[4:57:00] <hectic_harlequin> Damn that sounds good
[4:57:05] <%yeknomlive> on melee builds i always get banish because the ai fears banish so much they m guard way more
[4:57:11] <$Noponiz> magic guard dx is the best shit ever
[4:57:11] <%yeetdabsenpai69> REFRESH DX!
[4:57:13] <%legacy0117> As I said once before, Reggie, in comparison to the other two as Darkling, is more like Saturday morning cartoon villain compared to Dio or a demon from the Spawn series.
[4:57:14] <Shishi1205> That one is good for sure
[4:57:19] <hectic_harlequin> Damn these are some good ass spells
[4:57:20] <%alpacasintophats> M GUARD DX
[4:57:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> @yeknomlive That's some fucking strats.
[4:57:21] <$Noponiz> the damage reduction is unparalleled on mgdx
[4:57:25] <%yeetdabsenpai69> read mirror
[4:57:36] <Klefth> Yo
[4:57:36] <+MrAtheGreat> Cancels effects too!
[4:57:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> mjrro
[4:57:40] <%yeetdabsenpai69> MG DX
[4:57:40] <RurouniGeo> CANCELS EFFECTS WOOLIE
[4:57:43] <KRaZyAmmo> Mirror!
[4:57:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> CANCELS EFFECTS
[4:57:46] <Shishi1205> Mirror seems good
[4:57:47] <KRaZyAmmo> mirror!
[4:57:52] <Shishi1205> LEctro + mirror?
[4:57:52] <+IwuzPh34rless> mirror and lectro beam SeemsGood
[4:57:53] <%Superdandy96> Dark Reggie is skeletor whole Dark Woolie is just Dio. Got it
[4:57:54] <%Riottrio> Woolie finally learns about defensive magic
[4:57:54] <crimsonsaens> Mirror is risky
[4:57:54] <seamoosethemoose> Woolie do cance;
[4:57:56] <$Noponiz> every defenseive magic cancels the effects chat
[4:57:56] <+hoenhime344> gigga balze!
[4:57:56] <+poodo89> you can get mg dx and elec beam
[4:57:57] <Klefth> Lectro + mirror
[4:57:58] <seamoosethemoose> *cancel
[4:57:58] <%legacy0117> But back to Woolie shoppin.'
[4:57:59] <%Amaideus> He has the raw HP to give up the extra defense to prevent effects
[4:58:04] <%nintega010> that's fine
[4:58:05] <+thebeargoesHONK> Mirror + Beam
[4:58:09] <hectic_harlequin> Mirror + Lectro or Giga would be killer
[4:58:09] <+hoenhime344> the reflect thing is pussy talk
[4:58:13] <%Superdandy96> *While*!
[4:58:14] <KRaZyAmmo> Mirror beam1
[4:58:14] <%yeknomlive> lectro beam looks cooler
[4:58:14] <+poodo89> mirror beam
[4:58:19] <%chickenhunter> Magic Guard DX has a higher damage reduction than the other defensive magics in exchange for not doing anything else
[4:58:21] <%Riottrio> Mirror would be good for bosses, but pointless for PC's
[4:58:26] <Klefth> Giga Blaze is the spell you get as darkling
[4:58:27] <%kingkeldeo31> Darkling comes with gigablaze
[4:58:28] <SoupBowler> Doesn't Darkling use GigaBlaze?
[4:58:31] <%yeetdabsenpai69> the cheaters
[4:58:31] <Shishi1205> Lectro is better for sure
[4:58:33] <nepwar> big tanks can afford to trade health for extra benefits
[4:58:39] <mrblack499> pussy talk okay? lol
[4:58:42] <%yeetdabsenpai69> the cheaters gave it
[4:58:44] <%Riottrio> @nepwar good point
[4:58:46] <crimsonsaens> Giga Blaze is 7.4, Lectro has 8.9 power
[4:58:46] <f4ntom98> Mihn passed out XD
[4:58:46] <Shishi1205> Get mirror into lectro
[4:58:51] <+poodo89> yeyeyeye

[4:58:58] <nubreakable> thank mew :3
[4:59:00] <KRaZyAmmo> M guard DX
[4:59:01] <%jiggy_snipe> uh oh Woolie is gonna be scary
[4:59:01] <%legacy0117> Laser beam I hope. ^^
[4:59:02] <+Mekhet09> Save for bounce.
[4:59:03] <Shishi1205> Mirror is better for sure
[4:59:04] <KRaZyAmmo> get M guard DX
[4:59:07] <$Noponiz> a lot of the damage reduction is applied passively, without even using the command in battle. So with mgdx you can just defend and will still not take much damage
[4:59:10] <%jiggy_snipe> Reggie should start leveling Magic again
[4:59:12] <Shishi1205> Saves specials
[4:59:17] <+poodo89> yeyeye
[4:59:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie has enough health and defense to mirror.

[5:18:52] <%jiggy_snipe> it could still break something i think
[5:18:54] <%Th3SmartAlec> @crimsonsaens Doesn't M Guard defend against that?
[5:18:55] <$Noponiz> chat is SO WRONG. Magic guard would have done nothing
[5:18:59] <starwolfgang> Heckfire isn't magic
[5:19:04] <%legacy0117> So now Woolie is defanged now.
[5:19:05] <Shishi1205> Mirror would have defended vs that
[5:19:05] <%kingkeldeo31> Heckfire isn't magic though
[5:19:06] <crimsonsaens> Heckfire isn't magic
[5:19:09] <+poodo89> strike next turn?
[5:19:10] <$Noponiz> heckfire is not magic, you cannot defend against it whatsoever
[5:19:10] <Shishi1205> Heckfire is an ability
[5:19:11] <+Grayhammatter> nice, one shot
[5:19:12] <%Hawkbone_> Heckfire is an ability, magic defend wouldn't do anything
[5:19:18] <C4m3r0n0409> Woolie didn't have a great weapon anyways
[5:19:23] <%Fujiwara_92> heckfire isn't magic wools, don't worry
[5:19:24] <BurdRightsActivist> NEVA GIVE UP!
[5:19:26] <%jiggy_snipe> I think Reggie's weapon broke the same way when he defended against magic

[5:50:54] <%Th3SmartAlec> 1 oof
[5:50:56] <Shishi1205> Woolie tanks one then kills it
[5:50:57] <JonnyJonstar> I'm confused
[5:50:57] <%Picia000123> YEYEYE
[5:50:57] <%Riottrio> of what they likely to do
[5:50:58] <+Grayhammatter> wow
[5:51:00] <+poodo89> strike then regular attack
[5:51:01] <%Fujiwara_92> LUL oof
[5:51:06] <%legacy0117> Bounce sounds nice. Need to find it if you can.
[5:51:07] <+Grayhammatter> didn't even need the blistered feet
[5:51:09] <+poodo89> yeye
[5:51:09] <Camail> JonnyJonstar if the golem used its natural ability, bounce, he would die
[5:51:11] <DaBigVitus> he didn't lectro because his soul is filled with bitch
[5:51:11] <%Th3SmartAlec> @JonnyJonstar He assumed it would bounce
[5:51:14] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @JonnyJonstar fear of bounce
[5:51:14] <$Noponiz> it is not a 1/3 chance. Enemies have "behavior patterns". Each enemy is more/less likely to pick various options
[5:51:15] <mdkcde> if he had bolted he would have won
[5:51:21] <BurdRightsActivist> that imp just got FUCKED
[5:51:21] <mdkcde> Field volts woolie

[5:56:09] <%heroversusofficial> Minh speaks the truth
[5:56:11] <%Riottrio> they really should have punished Minh more
[5:56:15] <%legacy0117> DEBT is the only thing holding Minh back. And it's true.
[5:56:16] <%b_aleph> Lost this last hour due to my exam, anything big happened?
[5:56:17] <C4m3r0n0409> Very True

[5:56:43] <crimsonsaens> Eat breakfast first, guys
[5:56:47] <%Riottrio> cum on backs, wail dongs, lots of good quotes
[5:56:56] <DaBigVitus> what's the time in montreal?
[5:56:57] <thesickestzak> The Black Council needs collusion
[5:57:02] <%jiggy_snipe> 7 pm
[5:57:04] <lotharrio> Reggie, "I'm back."
[5:57:10] <DaBigVitus> ah, 1 AM here
[5:57:12] <Shishi1205> Yeah woolie you're better dealing Mg dmg to bosses
[5:57:12] <realapothe> JUMP MINH RIGHT NOW DO IT
[5:57:13] <%heroversusofficial> Spectator
[5:57:13] <Klefth> I so hope someone takes Minh off his fucking high horse
[5:57:19] <BlackIrisBalloon> wait, did I miss the end of the Dokapon manga?
[5:57:35] <lotharrio> Yeah this volume got translated, so we're waiting for the next one.
[5:57:40] <+hoenhime344> minh is haning on by a thread, all you people hating on minh are stupid.
[5:57:50] <C4m3r0n0409> Your class is too balanced WOOLIE
[5:57:52] <thesickestzak> @hoenhime344 NO U.
[5:57:55] <%heroversusofficial> They’re all fighting Minhs afterimages
[5:57:58] <%ECRead> no u
[5:57:59] <The_err0r> I think you can’t dodge battle magic
[5:57:59] <Decimated_body> Minh making chat FUCKING SEETHE is making me so happy lol#TeamMinh
[5:58:03] <perfectsalami> i guess i have time to catch up on vods
[5:58:05] <%legacy0117> Ineed.
[5:58:07] <f4ntom98> ! Uptime
[5:58:10] <%agumon9000> @WoolieVersus You auto get points in magic for being a magician. When you master a class you permanently gain an extra stat point per level up.
[5:58:12] <%Riottrio> Minh's speed lead isn't that great all things considered
[5:58:15] <BlackIrisBalloon> man, now I gotta wait for the Dokapon anime to catch up.
[5:58:17] <DaBigVitus> this game is the wildest shit ever
[5:58:27] <%agumon9000> The more classes you master the better your level ups.
[5:58:27] <+payatanharkonnen> !uptime
[5:58:27] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 5 hours and 58 minutes
[5:58:27] <%Picia000123> Minh strategy to just grind towns and keep a high count kept him high
[5:58:30] <nepwar> he only got out of debt because of the choker and because he won roshambo
[5:58:30] <%Fujiwara_92> Minh did the right thing selling it, but it still sucks
[5:58:32] <+hoenhime344> @Riottrio exactly
[5:58:32] <%jiggy_snipe> Reggie also has a lot of speed
[5:58:33] <%Riottrio> it used tobbe a much bigger speed gap
[5:58:42] <coldfire0007> So many deaths today
[5:58:43] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:58:56] <%nintega010> Honestly Woolie is stronger in Battle
[5:59:05] <+Grayhammatter> minh died so many times this session
[5:59:05] <BurdRightsActivist> Mihn has the high ground? So does that make Woolie Annakin?
[5:59:12] <+MrAtheGreat> Did Minh equip them?
[5:59:13] <%jiggy_snipe> but Minh's speed makes it difficult to hit him with field magic but Woolie will be most dangerous in battle
[5:59:18] <+hoenhime344> minh ONLY has towns. thats it. 1 darkling global dom will RUIN him
[5:59:19] <%Hawkbone_> When Reggie updates his gear he'll be the best in battle
[5:59:24] <%Fujiwara_92> yeah, in battle I don't think anyone can beat woolie right now
[5:59:27] <+poodo89> battle wise woolie is the strongest,
[5:59:28] <realapothe> Anakin won in the end
[5:59:28] <lotharrio> Woolie showed that he could murder either one in a proper fight.
[5:59:37] <%Riottrio> @hawkbone_ SeemsGood this right here
[5:59:37] <DaBigVitus> hail hail hail and kill
[5:59:38] <thesickestzak> It is always funny how Minh gets Woolie and Reggie to pretty much fight each other for 2nd and they still havent really done anything about it
[5:59:44] <+hoenhime344> and EVERYONE on the black counsil is picking on minh JUST because he is shakily in 1st
[5:59:47] <The_err0r> You just need like 8 magic mirrors
[5:59:56] <%Riottrio> but battles now will likely be way closer than ever
[5:59:57] <royb2> @thesickestzak It's been like that almost since the start
[5:59:58] <coldfire0007> Woolie fought off both them and a monster at once
[6:00:01] <%Riottrio> as in PVP battle
[6:00:04] <%legacy0117> Yep, which might happen if Woolie becomes the Darklington.
[6:00:05] <+hoenhime344> THATS WHERE YOU BELONG WOOLIE
[6:00:07] <Duke_of_HI> so Minh was the one that took the Napkin first?
[6:00:08] <%jiggy_snipe> yea people don't realize how tenuous Minh's 1st place is
[6:00:09] <realapothe> ANTAGONIZE HIM RN DO IT
[6:00:10] <%heroversusofficial> Minh is first but he sits on an unstable throne
[6:00:11] <+hoenhime344> IN minhs shadow
[6:00:13] <thesickestzak> @royb2 for real lol
[6:00:19] <Shishi1205> One in a cave
[6:00:22] <RurouniGeo> magic mirrors are an item...
[6:00:23] <%jiggy_snipe> a global assault isnt even necessary, a local assault on South America would hurt alot
[6:00:32] <%Riottrio> at this point, first place will always be vulnerable
[6:00:33] <+kyh9> The anime as fuck
[6:00:41] <turbofolk> Fucking woolie you talk like a politician trying to not offend anyone
[6:00:43] <Shishi1205> The shop that sells them is in a cave If i remember
[6:00:49] <crimsonsaens> If Minh gets to that item shop, no one is going to be able to finish the final boss
[6:00:50] <Daba_mk2> This is like a therapy session lol
[6:00:51] <@chesterr01> @jiggy_snipe I wanted to do that so much
[6:00:53] <royb2> @thesickestzak Ever since Minh got that speed advantage he's been in the best position just go for towns and stay in the lead and the black consul keeps fucking each other over.
[6:01:03] <turbofolk> Or a sports player trying to stay PG
[6:01:12] <zocano> Woolie is just explaining his thoughts 🤷♀️
[6:01:16] <%nintega010> yeah there is no Roboknight or hero this game
[6:01:21] <Shishi1205> South America Being locked behind a forest is a fuck
[6:01:35] <lotharrio> Crab buckets.
[6:01:37] <%alpacasintophats> unless you stock up on vanishes
[6:01:37] <%Riottrio> nothing wrong with speaking like that IMO, ita only shady when Politicians speak that way because they are up to heinous shit
[6:01:38] <%legacy0117> Yepppp.
[6:01:39] <%Fujiwara_92> nah, I still think they can get hero and roboknight
[6:01:46] <%chickenhunter> there is bullshit you dont know about
[6:01:49] <@chesterr01> @shishi1205 totally!
[6:01:52] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @realapothe
[6:01:54] <+Vancoolness> srcew the classes. chase the pool.. the people want blood not classes
[6:01:54] <nepwar> magic ain't shit if the guy in first blows you half way across the continent, seal your bag, and make you cripple
[6:01:54] <phatmac16> how much longer do they have to play?
[6:01:56] <zocano> Roboknight is absolutely possible, Hero less so
[6:01:58] <%jiggy_snipe> I imagine Austrialia will be similar but idk
[6:01:59] <Shishi1205> I fell you Reggie
[6:02:01] <%emperordread> There is always more bullshit in Dokapon kingdom
[6:02:01] <user_naim> Woolie can finish the Castle Run in 12 Parts
[6:02:02] <turbofolk> Fuck you moobot
[6:02:05] <Bakafied> When does the game end
[6:02:06] <+hoenhime344> @Fujiwara_92 i hope so, but fucking reggie is SPRINTING through those quests
[6:02:06] <realapothe> my bad
[6:02:07] <%nintega010> Woolie could get Roboknight
[6:02:09] <+DesertPenguin> !uptime
[6:02:10] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 6 hours and 2 minutes
[6:02:18] <Shishi1205> Oh god
[6:02:23] <Shishi1205> The moster of Sp
[6:02:29] <nepwar> lets not forget the minh has no magic defense action, he has to eat 100%
[6:02:32] <turbofolk> @Bakafied Never ever we are trapped in dokapon kingdom
[6:02:38] <$arcielardor> did Woolie win yet?
[6:02:40] <%Reverend_Roscoe> Minh really is Rock Lee
[6:02:41] <%Fujiwara_92> @hoenhime344 yeah, there's that, but both Minh and Wools are in the right track for both classes
[6:02:43] <thesickestzak> Being very selfish, I kinda hope we get a yearly Dokapon play through. I'd love another play through where the all know more about the game
[6:02:52] <Shishi1205> Minh still gets megafucked vs magic based monsters
[6:02:53] <turbofolk> fuck that
[6:02:57] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> @thesickestzak Agree
[6:02:58] <zocano> Woolie is not far from roboknight
[6:03:00] <user_naim> @reverend_roscoe holy shit thats accurate
[6:03:01] <%nintega010> Minh would have to do cleric monk and Alchamist to get roboknight.
[6:03:08] <ShadowpulseKDH1> Bring Pat into the next one lol
[6:03:10] <%jiggy_snipe> each person's build has pros and cons
[6:03:12] <+hoenhime344> @Fujiwara_92 true, but there are only 8 chapters. and they are in the 7th
[6:03:14] <%legacy0117> Minh after 150, will be fast enough to bring in alternate universe copies with his Speed.
[6:03:17] <+MrAtheGreat> Is magic guaranteed to hit? If so then Woolie will eventually be the one to beat him.
[6:03:22] <%Fujiwara_92> Wools is pretty close to roboknight, and Minh is not that far from hero
[6:03:25] <%Reverend_Roscoe> His speed is super high, but magic will catch him eventually
[6:03:26] <turbofolk> i feel we been playing nothing but dokapon since the year started
[6:03:28] <%nintega010> Woolie just needs Alchamist and he's there.
[6:03:28] <C4m3r0n0409> Woolie why is your build so balanced
[6:03:29] <realapothe> imagine the salt from Pat in this game
[6:03:40] <+Vancoolness> is there an endgame or does the game just end after a certain amount of weeks or chapters?
[6:03:40] <realapothe> we would all overdose
[6:03:45] <thesickestzak> I think magic doesn't miss in battle right?
[6:03:46] <Daba_mk2> Dokapon The Second Gig
[6:03:51] <Shishi1205> If Australia gets Conquered does the game end?
[6:03:52] <%chickenhunter> there is an endgame
[6:03:52] <%Riottrio> @realapothe Pat's mind goblins wouldn't let him through the first day
[6:03:53] <%Fujiwara_92> game ends on chapter 8
[6:03:55] <+paladinstarbuster> woolies lectro beam will mince mihn
[6:03:57] <%jiggy_snipe> @legacy0117 he'll get the scuttlebug then PogChamp
[6:03:59] <C4m3r0n0409> They dooo
[6:04:04] <%nintega010> @Vancoolness theres an endgame.
[6:04:06] <C4m3r0n0409> You need more
[6:04:08] <crimsonsaens> You have to invest in the towns
[6:04:12] <%legacy0117> That's 200, but yes.
[6:04:14] <C4m3r0n0409> Also need to invest
[6:04:19] <phatmac16> need to invest
[6:04:19] <%Riottrio> there is a lot of game left, don't worry people
[6:04:20] <+krabsan> !uptime
[6:04:21] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 6 hours and 4 minutes
[6:04:21] <%jiggy_snipe> yea invest too
[6:04:28] <%jiggy_snipe> that's why Danube is so good
[6:04:29] <C4m3r0n0409> INVEST WOOLIE
[6:04:33] <%nintega010> what chapter are they on
[6:04:34] <%heroversusofficial> Invest woolie
[6:04:35] <thesickestzak> The last couple chapters are the longest I think
[6:04:37] <%BisoromiBear> trying to attack Minh will just end in disproportionate retaliation
[6:04:37] <The_err0r> The next darkling needs to golobal assault to fuck over Minh
[6:04:39] <turbofolk> @Fujiwara_92 What chapter are we on? my mind just shuts down watching dokapon when there is no salt being thrown on screen
[6:04:41] <%Rhinoprotoss> Stonks
[6:04:49] <%Fujiwara_92> @turbofolk 7th
[6:04:49] <%heroversusofficial> Woolie stonks are on the rise
[6:04:50] <%Picia000123> I love this LP
[6:04:56] <Shishi1205> If woolie gets initiative vs minh he gets omegafucked by magic
[6:04:57] <%Picia000123> Keep it up guys
[6:04:58] <%Riottrio> yeah, we joke that it is always danube that gets hit by disaster, but it is thw only level6 Town
[6:05:02] <Shishi1205> and gains the mindgames of strike
[6:05:02] <+paladinstarbuster> just rust mihn on initiative
[6:05:05] <+MrAtheGreat> Dokapon Royale
[6:05:07] <turbofolk> @Fujiwara_92 Oh thank god we are close to finishing
[6:05:17] <royb2> the black consul needs to understand that they need to destroy Minhs stat advantage before they can even hope to prevent him from always bouncing back to 1st
[6:05:21] <%Superdandy96> When this ends, they’re friendship is either strength or fractured
[6:05:24] <%Solidnick18> yep
[6:05:26] <+krabsan> Minmaxed
[6:05:31] <%saltpiggu> He isn't captializing on his HP tbh
[6:05:35] <C4m3r0n0409> YEP
[6:05:45] <C4m3r0n0409> I've Noticed for awhile
[6:05:45] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[6:05:45] <%Fujiwara_92> wools is balanced, and that's fine imo
[6:05:59] <BurdRightsActivist> woolie is not balanced, and that isn't fine 4Head
[6:06:01] <Shishi1205> Magic is good tho
[6:06:04] <%jiggy_snipe> I think Woolie's build is fine
[6:06:12] <%heroversusofficial> @WoolieVersus The most Minh can do is slow you down, but you're too meaty to stop. Thats your benefit.
[6:06:21] <%nintega010> Woolies build is fine
[6:06:21] <realapothe> Black Council needs to do some serious colluding, f*** fair play
[6:06:24] <C4m3r0n0409> Magic. is super important right now
[6:06:25] <%Kriss1827> woolies build is good
[6:06:28] <%Superbro64> I dont think Woolie's build is fine :)
[6:06:41] <RurouniGeo> woolie can't hit anyone with spells so his build is trash
[6:06:41] <The_err0r> Magic beats speed both in battle and field
[6:06:43] <%legacy0117> Woolie you are the HP tank. You brute through heavy hits, where the other two die.
[6:06:48] <+MrAtheGreat> I think Woolie’s build is fine, personally.
[6:06:50] <%Fujiwara_92> yeah, Woolie's build is pretty ok... he needs more speed, but outside that is fine
[6:06:53] <realapothe> worldstar
[6:07:04] <%Picia000123> Woolie is good for fights, gets bodied by map magic
[6:07:08] <%A_DEAD_SHOW> RESET THE RUN
[6:07:17] <royb2> I mean we saw it happen, Woolie wiped both of the other players in direct confrontation
[6:07:18] <%alpacasintophats> don't forget the blistered feet
[6:07:23] <royb2> its just speed he lacks
[6:07:27] <nepwar> he just needs field magic not been 100%. if its below 50, he is unstoppable
[6:07:31] <+Vancoolness> what can they do for the channel with a follow up LP? there is no stepping down to Mario Party level shenanigans..however there is money involved now..
[6:07:32] <%Fujiwara_92> yeah, we basically have 2 rogues and a tank between the 3
[6:07:39] <Klefth> Minh's a fucking anime villain, lol
[6:07:40] <%nintega010> The best the others can do to woolie is delay, but fighting woolie head on is a risk for the other 2
[6:07:50] <+kikanshat0masu> What’s the game
[6:07:56] <emeraldskrull> I woolieTRASH woolieTRASH woolieTRASH
[6:07:58] <f4ntom98> I hope the save file doesn't corrupt
[6:08:02] <sir_foxwood> Time for that comeback
[6:08:03] <%Riottrio> @kikanshat0masu was dokapon but you missed it
[6:08:03] <%Superdandy96> Then there’s Minh who died 3 times in a row when we started the session
[6:08:08] <Ipsenscastle> Wow I just came back everyone looks so depressed and low energy, wtf happened?!
[6:08:09] <BurdRightsActivist> WOOLIEVERSUS: Final
[6:08:10] <Shishi1205> Ina future Vs Woolie can one shot minh with magic
[6:08:13] <DaBigVitus> the game will probably throw a huge curveball before the end
[6:08:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> Is this loss?
[6:08:19] <rubbishbinge> Still your heart is blazing
[6:08:21] <%ECRead> believe in King Kitan
[6:08:24] <%emperordread> You've already felt this way before Woolie, it ain't over yet
[6:08:25] <irfan_> rust is such a crutch for reggie
[6:08:26] <Shishi1205> Or force him into a surefire kill magic vs strike situation
[6:08:34] <C4m3r0n0409> Woolie you aren't even that far behind
[6:08:51] <%nintega010> @DaBigVitus the monsters at the end is already showing it Minh will have trouble also Reggie
[6:08:52] <%heartlesshealer> oh geez

[6:22:06] <+bear_breaker20> @ShadowpulseKDH1 so small when you put it like that LUL
[6:22:07] <%Superdandy96> Minh’s that antihero where I respect him, but damn does he know how to push my buttons
[6:22:07] <%Fujiwara_92> Minh for second, nothing against Reggie tho
[6:22:16] <+theotherkristian> As long as Reg is in first
[6:22:18] <nepwar> @CommanderSqueaks i laugh at you on my bud light throne.
[6:22:18] <%emperordread> 2nd is the least relevant position. What truly matters is who wins and who loses
[6:22:21] <perfectsalami> What are our exact numbers right now for the pools?
[6:22:24] <+tearknack> i do think it would be a lot more itnerting with a 4th person
[6:22:24] <%gatorafan> Why are all options only targetting Minh?
[6:22:25] <%ChoculaUltra> Minh is the Heel.
[6:22:30] <%Hawkbone_> Chat was really mean to Reggie this session, how about we show him some support? We love ya Reg <3
[6:22:31] <+tearknack> like msot games, to be honest
[6:22:34] <user_naim> Last try: The book was Mistborn
[6:22:41] <%A_DEAD_SHOW> THANK YOU
[6:22:43] <%heroversusofficial> Now they know
[6:22:46] <%jiggy_snipe> oh ok
[6:22:48] <%DatAsuna> good recommend
[6:22:51] <%jiggy_snipe> Mistborn wasnt a dead show lol
[6:22:53] <+Nobrev> i gotchu
[6:22:54] <EchoXOF> MISTBORN ROCKS
[6:22:54] <user_naim> yay
[6:23:00] <%BisoromiBear> Minh is liberating towns while the others chase selfish pursuits
[6:23:00] <RetroCop87> REGGIE, YOU DA CHAMP
[6:23:01] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> @bear_breaker20 I don’t know man, you ever see 150 20’s in a stack? Cause I sure haven’t
[6:23:03] <%Fujiwara_92> damn
[6:23:03] <%fetrigon> LUL
[6:23:07] <%Riottrio> awww, good of them
[6:23:07] <%DatAsuna> Reggie did nothing wrong
[6:23:10] <%nintega010> yay TeamWoolie
[6:23:12] <%Superdandy96> Lies!
[6:23:12] <%heroversusofficial> Have you ever seen 600 $5 in a suitcase?
[6:23:14] <%heroversusofficial> I haven't
[6:23:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> Reggie did nothing wrong
[6:23:26] <+exiled_blood> I mean he's trying to get mistborn to be a movie or series.
[6:23:26] <iswearimjustdandy> @datasuna but he never did nothing right
[6:23:38] <%A_DEAD_SHOW> Mihn is the best heel
[6:23:39] <%emperordread> Minh isn't a good heel, he's the BEST heel
[6:23:39] <%jiggy_snipe> Minh has been dominant
[6:23:42] <nepwar> forever
[6:23:42] <+bear_breaker20> @ShadowpulseKDH1
[6:23:49] <+bear_breaker20> woolieFABRICATION_SG
[6:23:50] <%Riottrio> Minh is the biggest Griffith
[6:23:51] <%Solidnick18> minh is a good heel
[6:23:54] <%Fujiwara_92> MINH IS AN AMAZING HEEL FOR SURE
[6:23:54] <rubbishbinge> Minh is literally Nobunaga
[6:23:55] <coldfire0007> Minh is a fantastic heel
[6:23:57] <%insomniacCoder> you are the villain Minh, just accept it
[6:23:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> He can't keep getting away with this.
[6:23:59] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> Lol
[6:23:59] <%legacy0117> I am betting someone is going to dive into the Casino at the last minute.
[6:23:59] <%Rhinoprotoss> Also poor decision making
[6:24:04] <%jiggy_snipe> and his magic use is top tier even before he became a magician
[6:24:05] <%Fujiwara_92> MINH IS NOBUNAGA
[6:24:06] <%Superdandy96> Hey that’s true. Where you at Minh gang?! Give love to your guy!
[6:24:17] <%Riottrio> i love everyone too much
[6:24:20] <Ipsenscastle> Minh is an excellent heel, Reggie is an excellent protagonist underdog, Woolie is defined solely by prodigious amounts of salt
[6:24:20] <%heroversusofficial> Minh is on that Lu-Bu level
[6:24:23] <irfan_> MINH GANG RISE UP
[6:24:24] <+tearknack> Minh gang doesn't need to speak up
[6:24:28] <%Riottrio> no real favouritism from me
[6:24:31] <+tearknack> Minh's actions speak for us
[6:24:31] <%BisoromiBear> Minh Gang 4 lyfe
[6:24:38] <sir_foxwood> If Minh is the villain and Reggie is the protag, what does that make Woolie?
[6:24:39] <nepwar> do not pursue minh-bu
[6:24:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> The correct answer is still wrong.
[6:24:39] <%Fujiwara_92> If I had to say who's the best player, it minh 100%
[6:24:45] <%b_aleph> MINH SUX
[6:24:46] <+bear_breaker20> jk its all investments in channel points...... @ShadowpulseKDH1 woolieLORE_HF
[6:24:57] <%A_DEAD_SHOW> BIG MONEY
[6:24:59] <%Fujiwara_92> @b_aleph rude DansGame

[6:25:44] <+Marsidicus> Hey Woolz, let Minh know that Lily from FFXIV misses doing Lancer runs back in the day.
[6:25:55] <%legacy0117> Or that blood ocean Thanos saw.
[6:25:55] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> I mean, Woolie is next up for Darkling and who knows how thats going to turn out

[6:26:26] <%heroversusofficial> This is the filler arc, things will start moving again soon @WoolieVersus
[6:26:27] <%Javaa01> All the progress this session was front loaded
[6:26:28] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> What is that? 40 hours? Averaged?
[6:26:30] <+bear_breaker20> how many games have been completed ?
[6:26:30] <alm3na1> Filler arc with some canon
[6:26:36] <%ChoculaUltra> can some talented artist make manga volume covers for each part so far
[6:26:37] <Klefth> Last session barely anything happened at all thanks to Minh
[6:26:39] <%Solidnick18> it's everyone just messing with everyone and it feels like you go nowhere
[6:26:39] <%Jetzord> Head ups to anyone that wants to participate in GIFG, Melty Blood is on sale on humble bundle if you're interested

[6:27:31] <%Solidnick18> I suppose
[6:27:32] <+InfiniteHav0k> Itll happen towards the end
[6:27:33] <%jiggy_snipe> a Darklington will be the equalizer
[6:27:33] <%gatorafan> GAME OVER YEEEEAAAAAAAAAAHHHH

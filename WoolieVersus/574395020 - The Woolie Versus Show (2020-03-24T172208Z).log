[0:14:42] <BeijiWeng> Fighting games take the hit lacF
[0:14:51] <andrei11dr> Woolie was wrong
[0:15:11] <+Crimznking> @oldmandeckardcain Is Reggie just the All for One of kinks?
[0:15:13] <DatAsuna> heya~
[0:15:14] <clueless_reaper> Woolie vs Sonic
[0:15:15] <+jiggy_snipe> Woolie was wrong about Mario 64 and OoT but he was right about 3D Sonic
[0:15:15] <petwisk> i knew that was gonna happened Adventurists are crazy
[0:15:16] <Nano_osecond> What the hells a sonic
[0:15:26] <OldManDeckardCain> yes
[0:15:30] <andrei11dr> I dont ,i hate all the 3d Sonic games
[0:15:33] <%The_Timo> From a technical aspect Woolie was very wrong. If we went that direction it would not have been even close to what you wanted lol, it would have been the worst Jank lol
[0:15:38] <Solidnick18> mario 64 ðŸ‘€
[0:15:38] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:15:39] <BeijiWeng> "when will you learn?"
[0:15:47] <+tuchpi> catching shit from Adventure fans LUL
[0:16:00] <worldbrand> i cant say i care for how SA/2 aged but that chao garden tho
[0:16:04] <Sundaysmiles01> You can't please everyone Woolz
[0:16:11] <Nekros4442> Wait why is that a problem?
[0:16:15] <DatAsuna> is this about MHA?
[0:16:17] <%Sparkseid> that really is a shame
[0:16:21] <andrei11dr> It's Sonic fans ,you know how crazy they are !
[0:16:24] <petwisk> @worldbrand chao garden is hot garbage
[0:16:25] <+jiggy_snipe> 3D Sonic fans BTFO
[0:16:26] <DatAsuna> oh sonic
[0:16:35] <+Ropcord> nobody disagrees with that one LUL
[0:16:40] <Sundaysmiles01> not even sonic fans
[0:16:47] <%generalve> Reggie everyone knows
[0:16:50] <+Ropcord> especially not sonic fans
[0:16:59] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:17:03] <Nekros4442> We should be totally be able to compare games in the same genre. I can undsrstand that my shlocky JRPGs arent for everyone but still love em >_>
[0:17:04] <%generalve> like have you seen their deviant art accounts ?!
[0:17:12] <rubbishbinge> City Escape fans are the true Sonic fans
[0:17:16] <+ZeKayTheEnd> WTF are people crying about now?
[0:17:22] <Nano_osecond> the three eyed gaming raven

[0:17:41] <andrei11dr> We're talking about the same people that have a wallpaper of Sonic being crucified...
[0:17:45] <Raztron> thats fine
[0:17:47] <UnfilteredComic> that was nuts
[0:17:48] <+tuchpi> jermaIQ
[0:17:49] <%Theycallmenerf> Are you ready for Half Life 3?
[0:17:57] <UnfilteredComic> good podcast moment
[0:18:04] <TigerClaws12> oof
[0:18:07] <+DreyfussFrost> The thing that bugs the hell out of me about the SRB comments was the focus on graphics. Of all the places Adventure went wrong, it was the *graphics*? Also, the Saturn existed. LUL
[0:18:07] <%Sparkseid> that goes both ways
[0:18:30] <+prime_name> That's me!
[0:18:31] <+Deano8817> Im fuckin 22 and I completely skipped the BR craze
[0:18:32] <+tuchpi> pubg as a first experience jermaDisgust
[0:18:34] <alrobot2014> one of my first game experiences was ffx-2, somehow still got into the series
[0:18:35] <Raztron> you should keep that distance if they're under 23
[0:18:44] <Tucker0603> I'm 23 I think my first game was Diablo 2
[0:18:46] <Raztron> zoomers be gone
[0:18:54] <+jiggy_snipe> a decade ago
[0:19:15] <+prime_name> Megaman?
[0:19:20] <laserbeaming> ffx-2 had some cool things, but everything about the plot was just bad
[0:19:27] <andrei11dr> FF7?
[0:19:30] <+thricechan> kingdom hearts?
[0:19:31] <TigerClaws12> SHIT WENT DOWN
[0:19:35] <BeijiWeng> I mean if you dont step on it, people complain that there's no love for the franchise lacWeird
[0:19:37] <Nano_osecond> ffx-2 ruined x for me xD
[0:19:37] <Daxalog> Tap the soil. There was a battle here. Its still going on.
[0:19:39] <%Irridium> you crouch down, taste the soil. "something terrible happened here"
[0:19:44] <Nekros4442> Woolie that exists in just about every game with sequels
[0:19:48] <emeraldskrull> sbfpUno sbfpUno sbfpUno
[0:19:53] <+tuchpi> #nationaldex
[0:19:54] <andrei11dr> Gen 1 is really overrated
[0:19:55] <+chaumiester> New Nerds vs Old Nerds... the whimpiest slap fight of all time
[0:19:55] <Raztron> Black and White da best
[0:19:56] <Nekros4442> You can't tip toe around in every genre
[0:20:01] <+Ropcord> half the time it's just because they watched the anime LUL
[0:20:03] <petwisk> it's an argument that IS going on since 98 when It Came out it was a War, Forces was suposed to end it, but Reignited it
[0:20:05] <+prime_name> Mystery Dungeon is the best
[0:20:13] <Raztron> gen 1 go away
[0:20:19] <DatAsuna> Colosseum or bust
[0:20:31] <Raztron> SeemsGood
[0:20:33] <+jiggy_snipe> DmC: DmC fans Kappa
[0:20:38] <Sundaysmiles01> nobody likes Sonic 06 still
[0:20:41] <Sundaysmiles01> its the one unifier
[0:20:49] <MattDemers> Gen 2 for life.
[0:20:53] <%Sparkseid> @sundaysmiles01 not anymore
[0:20:57] <+Ropcord> i love 06 because it's hot garbage
[0:21:03] <laserbeaming> some madmen do like 06
[0:21:03] <petwisk> Collors, Gens and Mania are Great
[0:21:17] <Sundaysmiles01> chris chan probably
[0:21:19] <petwisk> mania is the best
[0:21:20] <rubbishbinge> where are the sonic storybook fans at
[0:21:40] <@Squdnate> There is that with Deus Ex too. There are people who don't wanna admit Human Revolution and Mankind Divided exist at all
[0:21:43] <andrei11dr> Mania is the best Sonic
[0:21:46] <Daxalog> Is "Cuz" the right answer?
[0:21:57] <petwisk> @rubbishbinge i like thosse games story tho, but the games play terribly
[0:22:05] <+tuchpi> jermaOneguy
[0:22:13] <%Ecchigun> yooo earthbound

[0:22:41] <rubbishbinge> @petwisk yeah they're pretty garbage, but they manage to have the hypest shit
[0:22:42] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:22:43] <cj_art> earthbound would be fun to see
[0:22:43] <+TheFaustianMan> the guy on right looksd like knuckles

[0:23:02] <DatAsuna> real talk that's me about Tales games
[0:23:04] <andrei11dr> As someone that has just started SMT Nocturne as the first SMT i played i kinda feel Woolie
[0:23:07] <+tuchpi> just play it 4Head
[0:23:16] <petwisk> Mother 2 and 3 are great, Mother 1 (EB begginings) is Very Very aged
[0:23:19] <UnfilteredComic> Its a game you should play for yourself though
[0:23:26] <Raztron> you couldnt play SMT before Nocturne dude
[0:23:36] <Darth_Mama> !schedule

[0:23:49] <%generalve> woolieSHOOK_CL
[0:24:01] <+DreyfussFrost> Well instead about making a WoolieVS LP for the Mother fanbase, what about making a Mother LP for the WoolieVS fanbase?
[0:24:10] <%ChiRithy> mother 2 and 3 are some of my fav games from nintendo ever
[0:24:12] <+prime_name> It's like me and hearing people constantly bagger FE in Smash.
[0:24:15] <Raztron> i dont what woolie is talking about with earthbound
[0:24:25] <+TheFaustianMan> i nevr do
[0:24:28] <+BKNPham> yea i know next to nothing about earthbound
[0:24:31] <Raztron> the majority are just secondaries
[0:24:38] <+pedrothecruel> who cares about the mother fanbase
[0:24:38] <+TheFaustianMan> is left guy pat/?
[0:24:39] <+linSP> sbfpSetIn

[0:25:05] <dragorojo123> hi
[0:25:12] <nailwind> id be down to watch an lp
[0:25:13] <%generalve> nice mini podcast woolieSMUG
[0:25:14] <worldbrand> i can understand the hesitation for longer LPs but for shorter ones, your enthusiasm will make it interesting
[0:25:16] <@akuda_bar> why do woolie's dreads look longer today
[0:25:21] <%Irridium> literally all I know about earthbound is ness and lucas from smash are from it
[0:25:24] <Raztron> those sound like the crazy fans
[0:25:29] <Raztron> that you talked too
[0:25:32] <NWannabe> and that makes it true. paradigm dictates reality
[0:25:37] <+RaidouKuzunoha> RaidouKuzunoha subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:25:42] <andrei11dr> I saw a friend play Mother 3 ,and its a pretty crazy trippy game
[0:25:43] <Sundaysmiles01> hair grows akuda
[0:25:44] <UnfilteredComic> It kinda blows nintendos other rpg (pokemon) out of the water on almost all fronts, so its understandable
[0:25:46] <%RaidouKuzunoha> aw heck yeah woolie stream mother fricker
[0:25:50] <theKingRamses> any feedback from non-earthbound fans?
[0:26:00] <+linSP> homestuck and undertale were heavily influenced by earthbound
[0:26:08] <+DreyfussFrost> @irridium They're basically comedic jRPGs in a contemporary setting. Very "quirky."
[0:26:12] <rubbishbinge> @akuda_bar He cut out part of the podcast's length and put it into his dreads
[0:26:14] <Raztron> LUL
[0:26:18] <FuqBoiSlim> Mother 3 probably my favorite GBA game ngl
[0:26:21] <@akuda_bar> dread extensions lol
[0:26:24] <DatAsuna> Some games are great games you should pla but not LP
[0:26:33] <NWannabe> What day of quarantine are we on? I wanna start making memes
[0:26:53] <%TheFaustianMan> TheFaustianMan subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:26:55] <Nekros4442> You sure the bread isnt all sold out already?
[0:26:56] <andrei11dr> Even though i never played any Mother, im still hyped for Oddity

[0:27:09] <NWannabe> what DMC bleach post? *perks*
[0:27:13] <lucain_wreath> @WoolieVersus Honestly I love seeing you take on games that are unique and seeing your perspective on them.
[0:27:14] <+tuchpi> Kappa
[0:27:14] <%Irridium> @DreyfussFrost ah. thanks.
[0:27:17] <+jiggy_snipe> what
[0:27:24] <Nano_osecond> the spanish showed up and ruined it all
[0:27:25] <petwisk> JRPGs that feels Woolie-like are the Tales Of SÃ©ries that you can combo the shit out of everything
[0:27:30] <%Irridium> there were some neat fights but no, reggie, you didn't miss anything
[0:27:32] <Haarute> bleach was the shit for 64 episodes.
[0:27:34] <%GeneralSCPatton> All I remember is that Nel is best waifu
[0:27:36] <blaggablag> Have you considered poking around some entry level realistic simulators (driving, flying etc) just to see if you could make something interesting out of it? I remember you mentioning being interested in some earlier.
[0:27:41] <Soromops5050> sup woolz and reggo eggo VoHiYo VoHiYo
[0:27:43] <+DreyfussFrost> I saw that post and didn't take it as a slight on Nero. It made Ichigo look cool.
[0:27:44] <Solidnick18> lol
[0:27:44] <lucain_wreath> Also isn't there a new thing in the Bleach universe "Burn the Witch" or something like that?
[0:27:44] <NWannabe> now on a searvh of DMC/Bleach
[0:27:48] <@akuda_bar> the first two books in Bleach were so stylish and then he immediate gives everyone a costume change into fucking black robes
[0:27:51] <DatAsuna> liking dmc makes you a bleach secondary
[0:27:51] <%Ecchigun> show us images chat
[0:27:54] <%Ecchigun> please
[0:28:03] <andrei11dr> I've seen one episode of Bleach and tapped the fucked out
[0:28:10] <petwisk> i only played the First one (Tales Of Phantaya) and it's great
[0:28:13] <Elsewize> I wanna see the picture, dang it!
[0:28:14] <%Irridium> I mean, Kyrie is has the same voice actress as Orihime from the dub anime as well
[0:28:16] <NWannabe> Bruh, early bleach is so strong

[0:28:28] <OldManDeckardCain> Am I the only one who likes Bleach's first arc (pre soul society) the most? LUL
[0:28:41] <Kraahka> Hey guys... we're all in quarantine at home... stuck at home... home stuck?
[0:28:44] <+jiggy_snipe> that is similar
[0:28:45] <@akuda_bar> @OldManDeckardCain agreed
[0:28:48] <NWannabe> bahahahaha omg omg so real
[0:28:52] <EileenTheCrowe> @Kraahka Don't you start with that shit
[0:28:56] <dukenux> the Kyrie is uncanny
[0:28:59] <+Masamune195> orihime also same va
[0:28:59] <%Ecchigun> LOL
[0:29:00] <Lt_Campbell> good times
[0:29:03] <%NickHatesSnow> Don't the girls also have the same VA?
[0:29:03] <+BKNPham> LUL
[0:29:04] <Nekros4442> Bleach has the worst shonen bullshit
[0:29:04] <%generalve> @woolieversus the voice actresses for the love interest for both heros is the same to !
[0:29:05] <+DreyfussFrost> Not even his final form LUL
[0:29:06] <lucain_wreath> Bleach had a great build up to hype moments, that sound track alone sold it to me when I was a teenager
[0:29:07] <+kapcommunist> Ban @Kraahka
[0:29:11] <NWannabe> Hueco Mundo Orihime IS Kyrie. They do get married. Rukia Ichigo is non canon
[0:29:13] <%Irridium> same dub actress for orihime/kyrie as well LUL
[0:29:15] <%Sparkseid> Not even the final form
[0:29:15] <%Garthunox> Bleach is bad
[0:29:22] <Lt_Campbell> i liked bleach in high school. fight me
[0:29:23] <+Bonerlord911> this isn't doom eternal
[0:29:25] <+Mkingston> Bleach went on for way way too long
[0:29:29] <%generalve> yee
[0:29:31] <rubbishbinge> Meanwhile Honkai Impact added a character made of Nero's moves
[0:29:33] <NWannabe> black haired ichigo best ichigo though
[0:29:34] <DarknessD42> The official arts for Bleach is amazing
[0:29:38] <Elsewize> Tight Kubo. LUL
[0:29:38] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Bleach is the shittier out of the Big 3
[0:29:42] <mMayrro> Tight Cube is really cool Kappa
[0:29:42] <NWannabe> We all agree Bleach ended after Ichigo vs Aizen
[0:29:42] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:29:46] <%Ecchigun> bleach has a nice art yea
[0:29:51] <%Ecchigun> but shitty story
[0:29:52] <andrei11dr> The only thing i know about Bleach is that Eyepatch Wolf video i saw LUL
[0:29:56] <lucain_wreath> @WoolieVersus Burn the Witch takes pace in the Bleach universe if I remember correctly?

[0:31:22] <+Mkingston> This is why I'm loving reading Dorohedoro atm. It's not your typical anime.
[0:31:22] <theKingRamses> chase was my favorite of those
[0:31:23] <mMayrro> chase has great visuals
[0:31:26] <Raztron> Chase is good but to typical for a anime

[0:40:27] <andrei11dr> SKY CRIMES
[0:40:50] <%GeneralSCPatton> He gets so many that he has to build up and form a Borg Cube out of cars.
[0:40:57] <%NWannabe> they aren't crimes
[0:41:06] <DatAsuna> nothing will top afro samurai 2
[0:41:08] <EileenTheCrowe> I think I know what mission he's talking about
[0:41:24] <SomersaultJustice> it's wolly time
[0:41:25] <%GraceTBM> it really is dmcish
[0:41:29] <Solidnick18> i beat it this morning

[0:41:39] <%emeraldskrull> woolieGASM
[0:41:40] <+YabbaTroll> oh shit its not just me who is comparing it to dmc?
[0:41:46] <+linSP> dooooom sipsipHellmo
[0:41:47] <andrei11dr> I think there arw 12
[0:41:52] <Solidnick18> yes
[0:41:53] <%GraceTBM> you can do so much in the air
[0:41:54] <CookieDoughFK> Hear you lost the podcast yesterday
[0:41:55] <+waterbuddy16> doom eternal really is a lot like dmc5 in a combat sense
[0:41:57] <+DreyfussFrost> DWC, Devil WILL Cry
[0:42:05] <%NWannabe> Eh...does doomguy have a woohoo fun time vibe? He seems kinda self serious to me
[0:42:12] <Raztron> damn reggie get on
[0:42:19] <%GraceTBM> no woohoo fun time, it's all brutality
[0:42:21] <TigerClaws12> bhoping
[0:42:23] <EileenTheCrowe> I mean....you do get a grappling hook in Doom Eternal, though you do have to shoot it into enemies to get it to work
[0:42:32] <TigerClaws12> wait it's slide hopping in Tf2
[0:42:33] <dukenux> @nwannabe he has a nerd cave on his Doom Ship
[0:42:34] <+YabbaTroll> @NWannabe he has the most woohoo funtime vibe in his hideout at least
[0:42:34] <JetpackMcQuack> Sad woolie FeelsBadMan
[0:42:35] <%NWannabe> yeh a BIG part of DMC is woohoo wacky jackpot hero tone
[0:42:37] <%GraceTBM> meathook is reverse snatch
[0:42:38] <lucain_wreath> @NWannabe I mean he has a computer where he edits clips of his best glory kills... so kind of fun woohoo
[0:42:40] <nomos42> I bought TF 2 a second time for that
[0:42:42] <%Garthunox> stream titanfall 2 with reggie on controls!
[0:42:49] <+tuchpi> jermaSun
[0:42:50] <Solidnick18> FeelsBadMan titanfall
[0:42:55] <%NWannabe> ooh, nerdcave does sound right
[0:42:56] <DatAsuna> tat's kotor 2 absolutely
[0:42:59] <Daxalog> Unless ts Animal Crossing. Seen nuff o that
[0:43:01] <SomersaultJustice> so play KSS
[0:43:02] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus I still love that clip of me killing you then accidentally running into your grenade
[0:43:03] <%GraceTBM> @NWannabe we're talking about combat complexity, enemy variety, and input options and choices
[0:43:09] <DatAsuna> I love kotor 2, kotor 2 has been deep dived to death
[0:43:14] <andrei11dr> And considering Woolies love for melee, Doom gives you SOME BOLLER SHIT
[0:43:15] <CookieDoughFK> Its definitely more of the people
[0:43:16] <DatAsuna> so that one is all to see woolie react
[0:43:24] <dukenux> PogChamp
[0:43:24] <blaggablag> Regardless you will figure it out anyway
[0:43:28] <%NWannabe> @GraceTBM I get that, I just think DMC is more than it's mechanics
[0:43:30] <MLGprokactus> whoot
[0:43:32] <%GraceTBM> i love how eternal gives you THREE different excellent melee options
[0:43:36] <+DreyfussFrost> @nwannabe Doomguy is the Blue Oni to Dante's Red Oni. Everybody keeps talking about how there's a Vergil in Eternal, but it's far more accurate to say you ARE the Vergil. Doomguy has NO chill.
[0:43:39] <worldbrand> i did say there were too many death stranding LPs, but in the end i did stick around to the finale
[0:43:40] <gunsrlove> More people have seen the games rather not, Woolie has not played many of the known stuff, for niche taste reasons

[0:45:06] <+EdenOfSecondAccount> woolz, before you start, : Is there anyway you can change your layout so we can see your health?
[0:45:19] <+linSP> sipsipDab
[0:45:32] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Reggie pls
[0:45:38] <%GraceTBM> eden, changing it at this point would be pretty inconvenient, and there's not really a better layout that maintains as much screen as possible
[0:45:39] <CrimsonGargoyle> @GeneralSCPatton love that

[0:46:18] <Kraahka> Woolie you can go faster btw

[0:46:36] <fruit_pie_the_magician> it has to be the simpsons jokes from 20 years ago
[0:46:40] <worldbrand> are they?
[0:46:46] <dukenux> actually there are some marines in OF complaining that their containment mission boils down to gunning down buncha helpless nerds
[0:46:53] <+DreyfussFrost> @nwannabe Nah, the only jokesters in Doom are the demons that think they have a chance at being more than an errant fleck of ink in the book of Doomguy's legend. That's the sort of game it is.
[0:46:55] <derap41> Looks Gordon Ropes we can use these to get out of deep pits
[0:46:57] <Zeemod155> he's giving you a chance

[1:06:05] <+EdenOfSecondAccount> BIG GASP
[1:06:09] <%Will9099> use the magnum
[1:06:10] <unit24> magnum is perfect for this
[1:06:13] <OldManDeckardCain> patented reggie gasps
[1:06:17] <%optimasmaximas> D:
[1:06:19] <dukenux> magnum Woolie
[1:06:20] <+Balkespower> I am still wondering why he turrets were indestructible in HL2
[1:06:23] <%Will9099> the hitscan helps
[1:06:40] <Sundaysmiles01> any satchel charges?
[1:06:49] <%optimasmaximas> D:
[1:06:53] <+MrRabbles> dud
[1:06:53] <+aishman> One shot from the magnum also works
[1:06:54] <blaggablag> You can one shot them with the magnum if you're fast enough
[1:07:12] <This_is_Marco> Can you hold an object out in the line of sight like HL2 LUL
[1:07:13] <gade177> so people say that Half Life changed video games 4ever can someone explain that 2 me?
[1:07:20] <andrei11dr> You could duck and shoot the magnum
[1:07:20] <%TomFrank> I was gifted a sub to trashman woolieGASM
[1:07:33] <IAmCaligvla> have to throw over the fence

[1:08:33] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> i dont like my life too Woolie
[1:08:34] <Sundaysmiles01> I never ever used the wall mines
[1:08:42] <dukenux> the wall mines rarely come in handy
[1:08:45] <+DreyfussFrost> @gade177 It was one of the first ever FPS with a lot of narrative and was pretty revolutionary in how the narrative was told without interrupting gameplay. At the time all FPS were arena-style games like Quake and Hexen.
[1:08:45] <resloxxx> He doesnt know LUL
[1:08:49] <%TheFaustianMan> James Bond is the multiplayer is the only place to use them
[1:08:50] <kiharakun> wall mines are better when you are low health, since you can be a super coward
[1:08:53] <Kraahka> You use them to hold down certain areas
[1:09:01] <resloxxx> speedrun strats
[1:09:12] <unit24> woolie please speed up
[1:09:22] <OldManDeckardCain> woolie doesn't read chat tho LUL
[1:09:26] <lotharrio> Wall mines are a defensive thing for when you know (due to dying several times) there's an ambush coming.
[1:09:26] <unit24> actually wait no this is appropriate
[1:09:30] <MattDemers> You used to be able to skip this entire level by using them as a step over a certain barrier.
[1:09:33] <This_is_Marco> uhh no LUL
[1:09:38] <%Will9099> drop the ankle weights
[1:09:40] <IAmCaligvla> LUL
[1:09:40] <Sundaysmiles01> lol!

[1:09:44] <+tuchpi> jermaOneguy
[1:09:46] <unit24> my advice is good
[1:09:48] <+MrRabbles> "Please speed up" says government plant Kappa
[1:09:48] <This_is_Marco> Jebaited
[1:09:51] <%Sparkseid> Woolie pls stop listening to chat
[1:09:51] <dukenux> never trust the chat
[1:09:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> They were solid in the original, you could stair step up a wall with them.
[1:09:54] <blaggablag> Savescumming is basically a half life tradition my dude
[1:09:58] <Zeemod155> he's onto us
[1:10:00] <@Solidus_113> you can crouch it
[1:10:01] <+DreyfussFrost> DON'T speed up. Just one guy!
[1:10:02] <+Mr_Pylon> Woolie would coast at 20 kph in Mad Max

[1:10:20] <%TheFaustianMan> FUCK THE TROLLY
[1:10:21] <rubbishbinge> Woolie can't handle WILD SPEED
[1:10:27] <+linSP> jermaOneguy
[1:10:29] <gade177> so is this a remastered version?
[1:10:30] <%ElectricEmissary> trolly for cowards
[1:10:41] <dukenux> What could it be? It's a mirage!
[1:10:42] <+Mkingston> @gade177 remake
[1:10:43] <blaggablag> Today on, "is it detail or is it progress?"
[1:10:49] <gade177> Ah.
[1:11:02] <lotharrio> Problem solver.
[1:11:02] <unit24> woolie it's easy all you have to do is have the layout of the game ingrained into your very soul because you watched your dad play the original when you were 5
[1:11:04] <+DreyfussFrost> @gade177 Yes. Unofficial Half-Life 1 remaster. Fans have been working on it for 15 years.
[1:11:05] <+Mr_Pylon> Magnum's got the knockdown force
[1:11:06] <blaggablag> And now you know why the magnum is good
[1:11:10] <%TheFaustianMan> uses two bullets, empties revolver
[1:11:21] <dfs_k> it's a remake, not a remaster
[1:11:27] <+facenorway> Granny madden is driving to church
[1:11:31] <agustorm123> Its high noon

[1:11:54] <andrei11dr> Magnum is for headshots which Woolie won't get
[1:12:00] <Sundaysmiles01> Stealth Grenades

[1:13:25] <%TheFaustianMan> He's....he's.....he's not using a game pad is he?
[1:13:30] <%TheFaustianMan> This isn't a fighting game.
[1:13:30] <%Lion_kun> Woolie, try not getting hit.
[1:13:32] <IAmCaligvla> he is

[1:14:07] <+EdenOfSecondAccount> Woolie check out the wall
[1:14:10] <HumanDoctor> hmm i thought he was juat bad that makes sense now
[1:14:11] <andrei11dr> Why would he not use the stick?
[1:14:12] <+EdenOfSecondAccount> there's something written

[1:14:38] <This_is_Marco> hl2 ai wasnt the best LUL
[1:14:39] <lotharrio> The vortiguants don't know the layout, either.
[1:14:53] <+EdenOfSecondAccount> woolie there's something written back there
[1:14:53] <gunsrlove> BFG Division in the background
[1:14:55] <IAmCaligvla> @This_is_Marco don't know, i think black mesa has even worse ai than HL2
[1:14:57] <+EdenOfSecondAccount> i think
[1:15:01] <@Solidus_113> That's the AI. When they're hurt or alone they have a chance to run away and hide
[1:15:10] <@Solidus_113> they won't attack
[1:15:26] <blaggablag> They're not games known for their revolutionary AI, as opposed to HL1 which was pretty surprising for the time.
[1:15:26] <Silverun> woolie you can get some health from the soda machines if you wack 'em
[1:15:49] <andrei11dr> @gunsrlove Or it's BFG 1000 now!
[1:15:59] <@Solidus_113> you don't need to whack them, you can just hit the use key for it to drop
[1:16:02] <bleugh> outplayed
[1:16:03] <%GraceTBM> hl1 didn't actually even have ai, it just had really complex scripting and movement sequences that made the enemies seem responsive
[1:16:06] <LiI_Majin> @WoolieVersus why is the podcast 4 hours
[1:16:07] <+Mkingston> Watched 2 films yesterday. Dolemite Is My Name and The Platform. Dolemite was great and really uplifting. Platform was good but far from uplifting and I hated the ending.

[1:16:26] <gunsrlove> @Silverun It's Kar En Tuk now
[1:16:31] <This_is_Marco> @IAmCaligvla Id think so too, most of HL2 relied on pathing through levels. Outside of that they just sit in place
[1:16:40] <andrei11dr> Woolie missed the sweet lore
[1:16:41] <Solidnick18> who?
[1:16:44] <dukenux> Barneys spawn spontaneously arou d Black Mesa when you need them
[1:16:49] <Professor_Rakor> Hit new movie, Barney with a Shotgun.
[1:16:49] <+aceleapc> the soldier's red beret give health if you eat them sometimes

[1:26:31] <+Mr_Pylon> Cops don't have the powersuit
[1:26:31] <xXxPS9xXx> @Estuko My job texted me to say 'Crisis getting worse, see you in tomorrow' lol
[1:26:31] <@Solidus_113> HEV Suit is a problem
[1:26:37] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> @NWannabe yes because freeman would be feminine
[1:26:40] <Sundaysmiles01> cant handle his nerd girth
[1:26:41] <Vohs_Bru> COMIN 4 U
[1:26:43] <+Ancopro> no one told thjem he'd have a crowbar

[1:27:17] <%NWannabe> Yeh, they just dont want you to live a slave
[1:27:18] <IAmCaligvla> THE MOUNTED TURRET NotLikeThis
[1:27:26] <@Solidus_113> There was a turret
[1:27:26] <Sundaysmiles01> the weapon select on the controller sucks
[1:27:27] <dukenux> God i hate Freeman so much, he killed so many of our guys and his ass looks great in this suit PunOko
[1:27:32] <%Irridium> man just shooting him the kneecaps? ouch
[1:27:37] <andrei11dr> Why would the aliens know how to spell
[1:27:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> Soldiers calling up their superiors to ask who this Jason Bourne motherfucker in power armor is.
[1:27:44] <%GraceTBM> watching controller gameplay is like watching twitch control the game
[1:27:45] <natebud> not a headshot
[1:27:47] <+aceleapc> reggie where do you think the head is
[1:27:48] <%GraceTBM> it's hard ON CONTROLLER
[1:27:49] <blaggablag> IS IT THOUGH
[1:27:52] <Vohs_Bru> Extreme LONGSHOT
[1:27:54] <natebud> That was
[1:27:55] <%GraceTBM> it's also hard on keyboard
[1:27:58] <+MrRabbles> imagine if the venture brothers theme song played during action segments
[1:28:00] <dukenux> there ya goo
[1:28:06] <Sundaysmiles01> keyboard is less of a handicap
[1:28:06] <@Solidus_113> look at that turret though
[1:28:09] <dukenux> thats how you magnum
[1:28:11] <@Solidus_113> on the sandbags
[1:28:13] <IAmCaligvla> SO MUCH WASTE OF AMMO NotLikeThis there was mounted turret right there
[1:28:14] <unit24> oh shit magnum time
[1:28:16] <natebud> who needs turrets
[1:28:23] <%GraceTBM> no wonder woolz put the game on baby normal mode
[1:28:30] <blaggablag> See he one shots the magnum so he can freely touch himself while he headshots mofos
[1:28:34] <@Solidus_113> Lambda
[1:28:36] <resloxxx> Lambda
[1:28:39] <Lelfro> 2042
[1:28:41] <%GraceTBM> the lambda isn't a tie in to the game's aesthetic, it's literally part of the lambda complex
[1:28:41] <%GeneralSCPatton> Lambda symbol
[1:28:41] <gunsrlove> Lambada
[1:28:45] <+Slimshazbot> It's a lambda, the symbol for radioactive half-life
[1:28:47] <+EdenOfSecondAccount> that logo is the sign of the resistence
[1:28:48] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> yes do you remember physics
[1:28:49] <+Mkingston> nerd
[1:28:50] <+EdenOfSecondAccount> so there's goodies there
[1:28:54] <bleugh> it's the quake logo PogChamp
[1:28:57] <This_is_Marco> did they reduce magnum dmg or is it as op as it was in HL2?
[1:29:01] <gunsrlove> It's just the Greek letter L
[1:29:02] <UnfilteredComic> It is not just marketing, its a realthing
[1:29:06] <Vohs_Bru> I remember on hard mode the spyladies turn invisible
[1:29:09] <+EdenOfSecondAccount> That logo is the resistence's logo
[1:29:13] <natebud> @This_is_Marco two shots for a marine always
[1:29:13] <@Solidus_113> In HL2 that logo is put around places with a cache of supplies
[1:29:16] <%GraceTBM> it's about the same as hl1, if that's what yo meant
[1:29:19] <+Slimshazbot> No resistance yet.
[1:29:19] <%GeneralSCPatton> We on the way to the lambda complex
[1:29:20] <Kraahka> I'm pretty sure it's just as powerful, 2 shots for the body
[1:29:20] <+JJMcCheese> The Halflife 'A' is just as infamous as the Disney 'G'
[1:29:21] <+Balkespower> @This_is_Marco a single headshot is still instakill for grunts
[1:29:23] <Puhff> ook at the big brain on Reggie!
[1:29:24] <dukenux> @gunsrlove that makes it funny in a different way
[1:29:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> Half life formula is the same as compound interest
[1:29:44] <andrei11dr> I don't remember shit from the chemistry classes because i didn't give a shit about it
[1:30:00] <+MrRabbles> flooded market
[1:30:00] <zamzoph> too many lawyers monkaS
[1:30:01] <derap41> That's why you don't become a programmer
[1:30:06] <+MrRabbles> too much supply
[1:30:08] <Puhff> Shoulda been a chemist so you can learn how to make LSD Kappa
[1:30:14] <+Slimshazbot> Too many lawyers is like the worst apocalypse
[1:30:15] <+Mkingston> Hated chemistry, physics was good. I was really good at biology. I should have pursued that.
[1:30:16] <IAmCaligvla> too many lawyers... the nightmare NotLikeThis
[1:30:17] <UnfilteredComic> Its happening to software engineers
[1:30:19] <+MrRabbles> same with teachers
[1:30:24] <dukenux> funny, theres not enough doctors here(even before the outbreak)

[1:31:13] <+EdenOfSecondAccount> ITS THE ROCKET yay
[1:31:21] <IAmCaligvla> nobody wants to be a laywer now, so be a lawyer in 10 years Kappa
[1:31:22] <Vohs_Bru> nerf law firms
[1:31:26] <+Slimshazbot> Don't go to law school, just be an artist that commissions for suspiciously wealthy furries and be set for life
[1:31:28] <blaggablag> The medicine field self culls itself, mostly
[1:31:29] <+egalitarian696969> tfw aiming with the movement stick
[1:31:29] <andrei11dr> Iea but lawyers got more money for less pressure
[1:31:33] <DatAsuna> programmer is gonna be the lawyer of gen Z
[1:31:34] <chambatron> 0 shots lmao
[1:31:38] <zamzoph> I hear you make a lot of money if you're like an oil engineer in the middle of nowhere

[1:31:56] <Vohs_Bru> thats true Reggie ur father is a wise man
[1:31:57] <+JJMcCheese> Thankfully those tanks were infamable
[1:32:03] <Picia000123> how much life does woolie has?
[1:32:03] <pennykettle_> the world needs more youtubers
[1:32:05] <DatAsuna> heck programmingis already oversaturated
[1:32:06] <IAmCaligvla> jesus christ

[1:32:33] <+JJMcCheese> You got call of duty'
[1:32:34] <IAmCaligvla> please just the mouse and keyboard
[1:32:36] <lotharrio> Different toys for different problems.
[1:32:36] <Lelfro> use crowbar at this point
[1:32:39] <+DreyfussFrost> You're SEVERELY handicapped!
[1:32:42] <Vohs_Bru> Dr. Reggie
[1:32:45] <andrei11dr> If you suck at being a doctor, just be a dentist Kappa
[1:32:46] <bleugh> it's not you it's the aiming method
[1:32:51] <%GeneralSCPatton> If only a mouse-like device existed for high accuracy
[1:32:54] <rubbishbinge> I had to operate on a patient with a Bartholin cyst and boy being a doctor is not worth it
[1:33:01] <zamzoph> and now look where Woolie is 4Head
[1:33:05] <dukenux> "no sbfpGreen "
[1:33:05] <derap41> And Woolie became a professional gamer
[1:33:05] <+DreyfussFrost> It's not you it's your choice of tool.
[1:33:06] <rubbishbinge> jk but still
[1:33:09] <andrei11dr> "BECOME ASS GOD DARLINGTON"
[1:33:12] <IAmCaligvla> LUL
[1:33:12] <+facenorway> It's pretty telling that the only weapons Wollie will use are shotguns or explosives with auto aim
[1:33:13] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:33:22] <+Slimshazbot> @WoolieVersus You've probably said before but why aren't you using your weird hybrid controller KB+M setup?
[1:33:23] <resloxxx> Woolie vs the flock
[1:33:28] <Vohs_Bru> at least Woolie can draw
[1:33:31] <+YabbaTroll> we all have those days
[1:33:35] <Daxalog> Thas the time you put the trap mines down since you know where they were
[1:33:37] <pennykettle_> god I feel like shit, I just want doomguy back
[1:33:38] <dukenux> when you think about it, pastor and influencer aren't that different @woolieversus
[1:33:42] <+Rabbitmage> Use a mouse and keyboard
[1:33:44] <+JJMcCheese> @rubbishbinge I had to google what that was and wasn't happy about it
[1:33:49] <natebud> Woolie learned the ultimated technique of standing still and shooting
[1:33:50] <Fenlig> The controller was probably an after thought for this game really
[1:33:52] <derap41> Woolie is using a controller on a PC focuses shooter so its kinda forgivable
[1:33:53] <IAmCaligvla> mouse and keyboard please NotLikeThis
[1:33:57] <+DreyfussFrost> Every shooter is like this on controller, that's why they had to add auto-aim.
[1:34:00] <+Mkingston> My parents supported me with whatever dumb thing I wanted. I never got anywhere but I've always been grateful to them.
[1:34:02] <%GeneralSCPatton> @rubbishbinge Looked up what that was. OOF SIZE: OMNI
[1:34:06] <rubbishbinge> @JJMcCheese bruh, it exploded on my face
[1:34:08] <+DreyfussFrost> It's not you.

[1:34:17] <%GeneralSCPatton> @rubbishbinge Jesus

[1:36:46] <+EdenOfSecondAccount> woolz no, you can totally reach the ladder from there

[1:38:16] <%Javaa01> Not exactly, but the ladder there is loose because otherwise you would softlock yourself if you fell down like that
[1:38:18] <%NWannabe> save
[1:38:27] <+EdenOfSecondAccount> lower the next platform woolzer
[1:38:43] <natebud> The devs didn't playtest for someone falling down after pressing the button
[1:38:47] <+Slimshazbot> @WoolieVersus Is there anything you can do about the screen tearing?
[1:39:29] <+Rabbitmage> Time to nuke those ruskies
[1:39:29] <Vohs_Bru> Woolie please implement V-sync on the spot
[1:39:31] <%GeneralSCPatton> So far you haven't really aimed so much as flailed around
[1:39:43] <natebud> Rocket doesn't say NASA anymore
[1:39:44] <weatherreport240> I haven't noticed any
[1:39:47] <+EdenOfSecondAccount> now you just need to fire the rocket
[1:39:55] <andrei11dr> Im sure this is fine Kappa
[1:39:58] <IAmCaligvla> v sync Kreygasm
[1:39:58] <+Mkingston> yay
[1:40:02] <+Slimshazbot> Thanks!
[1:40:04] <Vohs_Bru> good jobu
[1:40:05] <natebud> They said it before but the HEV suit is full of tracking devices.
[1:40:05] <+EdenOfSecondAccount> LUL
[1:40:16] <alrobot2014> source engine always giving me a heart attack with the audio hitching
[1:40:17] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:40:18] <weatherreport240> looks good from here
[1:40:21] <Vohs_Bru> all good Woolz
[1:40:47] <%GraceTBM> back down the ladder
[1:40:52] <+EdenOfSecondAccount> rocket is ready to fire.
[1:40:56] <makeiks_rv> countdown
[1:41:01] <+EdenOfSecondAccount> Gotta get to the launch facility
[1:41:03] <%Javaa01> You gotta go back down the ladders
[1:41:06] <andrei11dr> Now,we get down
[1:41:08] <lotharrio> Launch that satellite of love.
[1:41:12] <GarbageNirvana> tbh I'd rather have screen tearing than frame stuttering, but that's me
[1:41:18] <weatherreport240> same
[1:41:28] <+egalitarian696969> it's a pretty good recreation of the HL1 voice
[1:41:28] <+EdenOfSecondAccount> ARMOR AND HEALTH Pogchamp
[1:41:32] <This_is_Marco> MrDestructoid l a u n c h n o w
[1:41:33] <natebud> Hot tip: do not launch the rocket while standing right next to it.
[1:41:48] <Reisadan> In your quest to play all the best fan-made 'official' games, you have forgotten the king of them all.
[1:41:56] <+EdenOfSecondAccount> the soldiers are absolutely using it, they have armor in their suits that use it too
[1:42:00] <%Javaa01> Anyone can use the health stations, but only you and military personnel can use the HEV chargers
[1:42:07] <Reisadan> Streets of Rage Remake, objectively the best SoR game ever.
[1:42:17] <%GraceTBM> military actually can't use the HEV stations according to opfor
[1:42:19] <lotharrio> @Reisadan Barkley, Shut Up and Jam: Gaiden? I'm told it's canon.
[1:42:19] <resloxxx> FASTER
[1:42:25] <%GraceTBM> OpFor has different charge stations
[1:42:29] <natebud> Barneys can't use the HEV things, had to constantly pick up armor during Blue Shift

[1:42:52] <+gutlesscoward> Faster, Woolie, Faster!
[1:42:55] <andrei11dr> I don't know, Cid would disagree
[1:42:58] <rubbishbinge> g o t t a g o f a s t
[1:43:04] <alrobot2014> always distrust elevaators
[1:43:07] <%Javaa01> Yeah don't stay on the tram elevators if possible
[1:43:13] <+YabbaTroll> nah go fast tho
[1:43:15] <%Javaa01> They're almost always traps
[1:43:23] <Andrizzleton> those are native to AZ
[1:43:24] <DarknessD42> Running in the 90's!
[1:43:24] <lotharrio> Surface for the second time.
[1:43:26] <pennykettle_> day has turned to night
[1:43:28] <+gutlesscoward> speedrun the game but also show off everything but also also talk over it
[1:43:42] <Vohs_Bru> 2BH this barely looks better than the original
[1:43:44] <IAmCaligvla> they gone, woolie
[1:43:44] <natebud> amazing
[1:43:45] <dukenux> you did it Woolie, you escaped Black Mesa Kappa
[1:43:46] <%Javaa01> Yeah they have their own tram to drive by you
[1:43:48] <chambatron> LUL
[1:43:58] <Kraahka> They did a driveby
[1:44:02] <%GraceTBM> they were on a tram and already left cause you turned the opposite direction
[1:44:11] <natebud> You cant see them, they cant see you
[1:44:15] <%GraceTBM> get closer dumbass
[1:44:18] <%Javaa01> Stand at the console
[1:44:21] <+Mr_Pylon> You can use the orange control box as a shield
[1:44:38] <+Mkingston> I've always hated this section of the game.
[1:44:44] <natebud> Really the only reason to use the tram is mobile cover
[1:44:45] <%Javaa01> Yeah you can crouch behind the tram consoles while driving them
[1:44:49] <+EdenOfSecondAccount> You missed that Military sniper rifle it would have come in handy here.
[1:44:49] <dukenux> atleast the track doesnt zap you like in the old games
[1:44:53] <+EdenOfSecondAccount> (kidding)
[1:44:54] <Sundaysmiles01> Wooly you're gonna love fighting the Assassins
[1:45:05] <natebud> the xmen are the assassins
[1:45:09] <%Javaa01> Welp rip the tram I guess
[1:45:13] <+Rabbitmage> This gun is really powerful. Especially against living things.
[1:45:15] <resloxxx> Tram-chan NO
[1:45:19] <Vohs_Bru> invisible assassins
[1:45:23] <dukenux> OW
[1:45:25] <+Ixiah> any chance woolie will look at Nioh 2 ?
[1:45:40] <IAmCaligvla> can you imagine woolie against the assassins?
[1:45:49] <IAmCaligvla> that will be good...
[1:45:49] <+EdenOfSecondAccount> woooolzer why u wasting rifle grenades :(
[1:45:55] <%jakb001> jakb001 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:46:01] <%Javaa01> That's just a staging light
[1:46:03] <natebud> The beret guys use the grenade launcher rarely
[1:46:06] <+Mkingston> @IAmCaligvla This game really was made for mouse and keyboard
[1:46:14] <Sundaysmiles01> because he can't aim with that controller Eden
[1:46:26] <%GraceTBM> woolie is wasting rifle grenades cause he has both wrists tied behind his back LUL LUL
[1:47:21] <Zeemod155> just blap blap blap blap all day

[1:48:22] <%Will9099> woolieDATTEBAYO
[1:48:30] <+Hapsam> im so sorry for holding everybody up my bad
[1:48:31] <alrobot2014> twitch gets weird audio distortions sometimes
[1:48:33] <+EdenOfSecondAccount> my pc fucking wont start, i'm going to have to go in and do surgery on it :(
[1:48:35] <dukenux> Reggie pls LUL
[1:48:37] <+DreyfussFrost> When it's just one guy it's them. If it was you, there would be spam in chat.
[1:48:37] <+YabbaTroll> the amount of times i've thought a stream was echoing while i had 2 tabs open is nuts
[1:48:45] <%GraceTBM> yes yes yes please
[1:48:47] <+YabbaTroll> YASSS
[1:48:49] <+EdenOfSecondAccount> YES
[1:48:50] <unit24> oh my god
[1:48:51] <Vohs_Bru> switch 2 ethernet
[1:48:51] <+EdenOfSecondAccount> YESSS
[1:48:52] <blaggablag> psa1guy
[1:48:53] <+EdenOfSecondAccount> YESSSSS
[1:48:54] <%GraceTBM> PLEASE
[1:48:54] <%Irridium> YES
[1:48:54] <+egalitarian696969> THE HYBRI?
[1:48:54] <Haarute> PLEASE
[1:48:55] <unit24> holy shit here we GO
[1:48:58] <rubbishbinge> cursed controls
[1:49:00] <dukenux> @hapsam dont worry
[1:49:02] <%Irridium> THE ABOMINATION LIVES
[1:49:09] <blaggablag> YES!
[1:49:11] <%Will9099> oh god the setup
[1:49:13] <natebud> it would be cool if you did, but this game is easy enough with controller.
[1:49:13] <%GraceTBM> turn your sensitivity up
[1:49:14] <+DreyfussFrost> HALFWAY THERE!
[1:49:17] <lotharrio> There's probably a good combination of sensitivity that would work well here.
[1:49:20] <worldbrand> honestly i play with both and it takes time for me to adjust back and forth
[1:49:21] <dukenux> YEYEYE the abominable CHIMERA SETUP
[1:49:22] <blaggablag> STRATS PREVAIL
[1:49:25] <bleugh> just do flick shotz
[1:49:26] <%GraceTBM> you want to be moving and shooting at the same time
[1:49:27] <%Will9099> you can turn down the sway when you move
[1:49:31] <@Solidus_113> oh, it looks so natural now Kappa
[1:49:34] <+NekoNinja13> why arent hybrid controls widely accepted?
[1:49:35] <Visorak6> turn your sensitivity up a bit for that style and youll be fine
[1:49:46] <Haarute> if your mouse has buttons bind some guns to it
[1:49:48] <+YabbaTroll> noones that good at that though
[1:49:48] <blaggablag> If you retain mousewheel to change weapons you're golden
[1:49:55] <+gfbagel> tfw no autoaim
[1:49:58] <natebud> And you wont have to scroll through 15 weapons to find the one you want
[1:50:16] <Cory_the_Dinosaur> ^
[1:50:22] <+DreyfussFrost> Woolie the reason you're bad with mouse is because you lack practice. How good were you at fighting games week one?
[1:50:40] <+egalitarian696969> Definitely try lower sens if you're gonna use mouse.
[1:50:41] <natebud> Woolie, humor me and try selecting weapons with the number keys.
[1:50:45] <blaggablag> In defense of the mouse you get used to it rather quickly
[1:50:46] <%GraceTBM> this is literally the most perfect game to practice both mouse and keyboard in
[1:51:03] <%Javaa01> Well, CS:GO aim maps are the best practice
[1:51:06] <derap41> no homo
[1:51:10] <%Javaa01> But this is good practical practice
[1:51:22] <+sir_louis> NEED THAT GAMER CUBE
[1:51:24] <Dr_Mooose> get the gamer cube
[1:51:25] <+DreyfussFrost> You aren't good because you lack experience, you have to just push through and then it will become a lifelong skill, like playing on stick.
[1:51:25] <%GraceTBM> get a clipboard or something else for a hard surface
[1:51:30] <Haarute> but woolie there is only room for growth here.
[1:51:34] <Cory_the_Dinosaur> get a gamer cube like Pat LUL
[1:51:37] <+EdenOfSecondAccount> dont you have a lapboard from the SBFP days?
[1:51:39] <+kapcommunist> gonna hurt your wrist, too
[1:51:45] <+DreyfussFrost> Yeah that's also true, but it should still be better.
[1:51:45] <This_is_Marco> rip wrists
[1:51:49] <DatAsuna> okay john
[1:51:51] <%Tearonex> Pat needs to hook him up with the gamer cube
[1:51:52] <%FuqBoiSlim> FuqBoiSlim subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Dang 4 months already? Love ya woolz. keep doing what you're doing. Also, when's Bayo 2
[1:52:06] <blaggablag> That cube would pay itself is all I'm saying
[1:52:07] <+DreyfussFrost> Yessssss, get Woolie a gamer cube!
[1:52:07] <+YabbaTroll> its cool dude
[1:52:18] <+EdenOfSecondAccount> Woolz get the lapboard out Kappa but seriously invest in one?
[1:52:19] <+Mkingston> Purple and green gamer cube
[1:52:29] <%emeraldskrull> "I'm doing this on camera to annoy you" woolieDATTEBAYO
[1:52:37] <+DreyfussFrost> 5 feels perfect for me in Source but it's all preference.
[1:52:48] <+egalitarian696969> I use 1.8 sens lol
[1:52:54] <+egalitarian696969> big mousepad boys
[1:53:06] <+egalitarian696969> 400dpi
[1:53:06] <blaggablag> So, hear me out, it's the cube but it's reskinned to be an EVA cockpit
[1:53:17] <%Irridium> at the top of combat
[1:53:17] <Visorak6> top of combat woolie
[1:53:19] <Tucker0603> top of combat
[1:53:41] <%NWannabe> Hey chat, which PSX Wipeout game is the best?
[1:53:43] <andrei11dr> The menu ,the true final boos
[1:53:45] <This_is_Marco> its cool :)
[1:53:51] <+Irridium> hey man just do what you gotta do
[1:53:53] <andrei11dr> Boss*
[1:54:06] <+DreyfussFrost> I find 5 perfect, personally.
[1:54:26] <Cory_the_Dinosaur> @egalitarian696969 put some weights on that mouse and you'll have a sick right hook in no time
[1:54:26] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:54:32] <Edible_Enthusiasm> I cannot hear the coorasponding voices to go with these subtitles
[1:54:56] <natebud> Voices are weirdly quiet in this game
[1:55:01] <@Solidus_113> Rocket: Stage 2
[1:55:11] <+Slimshazbot> THis game's sound mixing is kinda... wacky
[1:55:16] <IAmCaligvla> he's using a mouse?! PogChamp
[1:55:17] <%GraceTBM> this is subastantially better for sure
[1:55:20] <andrei11dr> Potato aim is real, holy shit LUL
[1:55:21] <Visorak6> hes using mouse now
[1:55:25] <%GraceTBM> no irony this is improved
[1:55:28] <IAmCaligvla> OH LORD YES PogChamp
[1:55:30] <+kapcommunist> aim looks better already imo
[1:55:38] <+croxeye> did woolie actually switch to m&k?
[1:55:39] <This_is_Marco> its an uncomfortable setup id imagine
[1:55:41] <Sundaysmiles01> is he using a controller AND a mouse??
[1:55:41] <IAmCaligvla> this is so much better
[1:55:45] <bleugh> next learn to use cover Kappa
[1:55:49] <Visorak6> hes doing the abomination yes
[1:55:57] <%FuqBoiSlim> cant even call johns with the controller anymore NotLikeThis
[1:55:57] <This_is_Marco> hes using num pad
[1:56:01] <alrobot2014> if the abomination works it works
[1:56:04] <+croxeye> i dunno controller and mouse works well if you're used to controller for moving only
[1:56:05] <Sundaysmiles01> keyboard has better weapon select
[1:56:07] <Naho_Saenoki> Hooray for abomination controls!
[1:56:08] <%GraceTBM> this mix is still better than just controller for sure
[1:56:15] <+EdenOfSecondAccount> Welcome to the black mesa Missile Launching Facility
[1:56:15] <Haarute> i for one embrace our new abomination overlords
[1:56:18] <andrei11dr> Just have Reggie move and Woolie shooting
[1:56:19] <+croxeye> but basically what you're saying is Woolie needs a "GAMER CUBE"
[1:56:30] <%Javaa01> Nope, the dark green military boxes are not breakable
[1:56:31] <%NWannabe> People calling it better until he gets murdered by a headcrab
[1:56:31] <%GraceTBM> andrei lul
[1:56:34] <+DreyfussFrost> It's halfway to ideal, which is better than none of the way.
[1:56:39] <lotharrio> Had to reload. Is Woolie's alchemic abomination working out?
[1:56:42] <IAmCaligvla> Jebaited
[1:56:51] <Zebroneath> WOW
[1:56:52] <This_is_Marco> is wools switches to mouse and keyboard he'd outdo max and pat real fast
[1:56:54] <+YabbaTroll> LUL
[1:56:54] <Visorak6> Jebaited
[1:56:57] <natebud> Good job black mesa devs
[1:56:58] <%GraceTBM> pretty sure that door is supposed to work
[1:57:00] <%FuqBoiSlim> here it comes
[1:57:05] <Sundaysmiles01> masterfully baited
[1:57:10] <%FuqBoiSlim> Jebaited
[1:57:12] <%Irridium> right in the ass
[1:57:17] <%NWannabe> @This_is_Marco how? thats not his pref style...he'd hafta learn
[1:57:21] <%GraceTBM> there's a turret
[1:57:24] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:57:29] <Visorak6> the turret tho
[1:57:33] <+Rabbitmage> WE GOT CHARLIE ALL OVER
[1:57:34] <+YabbaTroll> "cover"
[1:57:36] <Dr_Mooose> many bullets
[1:57:39] <Zeemod155> jump and duck
[1:57:40] <@Solidus_113> SourPls
[1:57:44] <IAmCaligvla> ye boi SourPls
[1:57:49] <natebud> Woolies has walked past so many turrets
[1:57:57] <This_is_Marco> @NWannabe yea thats true, but if he sticks with it I mean
[1:58:01] <+AmanDotZip> cgoke??
[1:58:03] <andrei11dr> Yes ,he found it ,thank God
[1:58:10] <%GraceTBM> this is way more fun to watch for reals
[1:58:16] <Naho_Saenoki> "No! I'm with the science team!"
[1:58:25] <Visorak6> But its free ammo
[1:58:29] <+MrRabbles> blind fire is possible with the machine gun
[1:58:29] <+AmanDotZip> these hughe fights are fairly difficult
[1:58:29] <+YabbaTroll> you can actually fire from behind cover like spec ops the line in this
[1:58:30] <IAmCaligvla> it's good, you just can't aim Kappa
[1:58:35] <unit24> the machine good is super good
[1:58:48] <natebud> no woolies right, they made turrets aim worse in this game.
[1:58:56] <%GraceTBM> crouching while using the turret locks it's orientation until you stand up again
[1:59:00] <%Javaa01> The machine guns can cut down anything and everything, but you gotta shoot straight
[1:59:03] <%Javaa01> And not at the ground
[1:59:09] <andrei11dr> "Fire in the Woolie hole"
[1:59:10] <%GeneralSCPatton> That battery launch tho
[1:59:21] <+AmanDotZip> you have a GRENADE LAUNCHER on the sub machine
[1:59:23] <Sundaysmiles01> Woolie's actually murdering things, this is why you forsake the evils of the controller
[1:59:24] <Visorak6> you're aiming a lot better for sure
[1:59:40] <Naho_Saenoki> @Sundaysmiles01 But he still is though.
[1:59:46] <%FuqBoiSlim> you got to hide behind the wall like you're playing black ops again
[2:00:05] <This_is_Marco> PogChamp
[2:00:05] <@Solidus_113> It's all skill
[2:00:09] <+slimmixrp> Hybrid controls 2020
[2:00:09] <RantingRavager> RIP AND TEAR
[2:00:14] <%Javaa01> It's almost like this game was designed for a mouse or something

[2:00:39] <+croxeye> woolie, if the hybrid works for you use it more! you'll probably need it for doom eternal tbh
[2:00:41] <+Rabbitmage> There was a dead scientist in that crate
[2:00:44] <lotharrio> That seemed like a situation that would have taken 2-3 attempts before. Good job figuring it out, Woolie.

[2:01:28] <+DreyfussFrost> Start a GoFundMe to get Woolie a gamercube.
[2:01:29] <worldbrand> WARNING: INCOMING GAMERCUBE
[2:01:30] <andrei11dr> You gotta get those G Gundam controls LUL
[2:01:34] <natebud> practice with the turret real quick
[2:01:35] <lotharrio> I think I saw a ladder in that basement/bunker.
[2:01:39] <%GraceTBM> that one is broken
[2:01:40] <Professor_Rakor> That's source turrets.
[2:01:46] <+AmanDotZip> the turret is awkward af in this game
[2:01:49] <derap41> That's deliberate
[2:01:59] <+Rabbitmage> The game wanted you to mow them down with the turret
[2:02:03] <+Mkingston> Compared to Doom Eternal. We've come a long way.
[2:02:03] <natebud> There will be turret challenges later
[2:02:04] <Haarute> you can crouch and fire though so that's good
[2:02:04] <Vohs_Bru> more like shit turrets
[2:02:04] <Zeemod155> Same in HL2 unfortunately
[2:02:09] <This_is_Marco> Hl2 turrets arent much better
[2:02:12] <%FuqBoiSlim> Didnt one of the guys had their mousepad on a little stool back in the day? I think it was Pat?
[2:02:12] <IAmCaligvla> eh, might be because i've played so much hl2 in my time, but i think that's fine
[2:02:19] <dukenux> the turrets arent a mechanic you will use a lot anyway
[2:02:20] <%GraceTBM> you can't move the aim while crouching
[2:02:54] <dukenux> it might've been at one point
[2:02:58] <dukenux> in HL DM

[2:03:55] <%Th3SmartAlec> thanks HEV suit!
[2:04:03] <+slimmixrp> Lmao Kanye
[2:04:05] <dukenux> is Woolie using his combo setup now?
[2:04:05] <bloodyheartland> is this the new half life
[2:04:14] <%GraceTBM> it should have saved you but it didn't
[2:04:14] <natebud> Remember when you got 10 rifle grenades? good times
[2:04:19] <+croxeye> the servers will not protect you LUL
[2:04:20] <%Th3SmartAlec> the wall saved them from your grenade that's for sure
[2:04:29] <IAmCaligvla> derd
[2:04:38] <%Javaa01> Nah, it's just that those server racks have gaps between them, so the line of sight check from the grenade damage hit you through a gap
[2:04:41] <worldbrand> Nerd (Nothing)
[2:04:43] <%GraceTBM> no bloody, it's a rip off with the same level structure, gameplay, aesthetics and named black mesa

[2:06:00] <natebud> those legs were there when I got here, I swear
[2:06:01] <+Slimshazbot> @gunsrlove It had a satteline that SHOULD let them close the portals
[2:06:02] <+croxeye> @gunsrlove it sets up a relay between earth and the alien dimensional world Xen
[2:06:03] <lotharrio> Spacey Bob?
[2:06:11] <gunsrlove> oh ok
[2:06:12] <popcultureaficionado> he's a cool guy
[2:06:18] <dukenux> playing "Space Oddity" IN SPACE
[2:06:20] <%GraceTBM> i just realized they cut the explosives room before the launch room from a previous build
[2:06:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> ...does he need to get Leon Kenneth to fuck his sister?
[2:06:26] <gunsrlove> ive forgotten p much everything about hl1
[2:06:31] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[2:06:44] <natebud> Disappointed at the lack of rails in on a rail
[2:06:55] <%GraceTBM> on a rail has plenty of rails
[2:07:02] <natebud> Not nearly enough!
[2:07:03] <+Troispoint> Kids nowadays don't dream of becoming an astronaut, they dream of streaming Fortnite for a living smh!
[2:07:07] <%GraceTBM> maybe left trigger?
[2:07:08] <+devonoel> there's a rail in sight right now
[2:07:10] <+croxeye> oh man, 2 chapters till Surface tension
[2:07:10] <IAmCaligvla> @natebud there's a mod that adds more to this chapter of the game
[2:07:16] <Zeemod155> what?
[2:07:25] <+kapcommunist> kids nowadays eating ass smh
[2:07:29] <+hakma> being an astronaut sucks dude @Troispoint stuck in space no privacy
[2:07:29] <IAmCaligvla> 8?!
[2:07:37] <%Th3SmartAlec> The menu sounds like a purring owl
[2:07:44] <%GraceTBM> LB?
[2:07:45] <andrei11dr> Do you have the back triggers on your controller?
[2:07:49] <+Slimshazbot> @IAmCaligvla P sure its for his controller setup
[2:08:02] <dukenux> It's bound tho
[2:08:03] <+Troispoint> @hakma yeah how do you even jack off in peace on the international station?
[2:08:06] <IAmCaligvla> @Slimshazbot makes sense
[2:08:12] <%GraceTBM> @WoolieVersus Controller support isn't complete and is an afterthought
[2:08:13] <andrei11dr> That's odd
[2:08:16] <TigerClaws12> oof
[2:08:18] <+hakma> @Troispoint You don't you just keep it in till you land
[2:08:20] <%FuqBoiSlim> You pull plenty bad bitches with a booming fortnite career. How many bad bitches are out there in space hm???

[2:08:31] <andrei11dr> Old game problems
[2:08:45] <natebud> cursed setup problems
[2:08:47] <Pnuts_> Xpadder of Joy2Key can fix that problem
[2:08:57] <Visorak6> Welcome to the fun part of this level
[2:08:58] <%Th3SmartAlec> @andrei11dr They kept it in the remake for nostalgia
[2:08:58] <+GrislyBoar> How are you enjoying this game so far?
[2:09:01] <dukenux> that's a pool of death
[2:09:05] <+Slimshazbot> @FuqBoiSlim When we discover stupidly sexy space aliens the astronauts will get the last laugh.
[2:09:09] <dukenux> and still searching for his icing
[2:09:10] <%GraceTBM> honestly, they should'nt have made controller support available until the menus worked and there was autoaim implemented
[2:09:11] <%Th3SmartAlec> Look at him go!
[2:09:11] <TigerClaws12> someone enlighten Woolie about scroll jumping Kappa
[2:09:12] <Dr_Mooose> @FuqBoiSlim bruh you ever seen a twi'lek
[2:09:13] <natebud> Having a grand old time
[2:09:15] <IAmCaligvla> that's a pool of mountain dew
[2:09:15] <+Rabbitmage> "Where are my glasses?"
[2:09:16] <dukenux> shoot the gas tanks!
[2:09:19] <This_is_Marco> technically yea
[2:09:19] <%Javaa01> Well the body is still being animated by the crab
[2:09:23] <mr_mushie> the headcrab is
[2:09:30] <Professor_Rakor> You don't need legs to brain.
[2:09:41] <%Javaa01> Since the crabs can skip the whole requirement for brain activity
[2:09:44] <%GraceTBM> rakor you should cross stitch that
[2:09:49] <Visorak6> deadcrab
[2:09:55] <+asasqw> @Javaa01 No they are fully aware. When you light them on fire they scream for help backwards and distorted
[2:09:57] <andrei11dr> I think it keeps them alive as long as its still attached
[2:10:00] <DedlokPM> Person is dead, head crab is still alive. Head crab care not about legs
[2:10:01] <%GraceTBM> i love 24/7 flashlight
[2:10:12] <%GraceTBM> pull my barnacle trigger
[2:10:14] <dukenux> i guess they're stuck in a... Half-life, huh?
[2:10:32] <%Javaa01> @asasqw When the full body is around, but if brain activity stops, it can still skip that requirement
[2:10:44] <%FuqBoiSlim> @dukenux woolieDATTEBAYO
[2:10:46] <IAmCaligvla> @dukenux this is black mesa though Kappa
[2:10:46] <dukenux> essential Q button
[2:10:51] <natebud> Will that work if you're constantly scrolling through weapons?
[2:10:52] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie will figure it out
[2:10:53] <%Javaa01> So that's why half body zombies still work
[2:11:10] <%Javaa01> Even though the shock would knock out any person
[2:11:14] <+AbnormalVoid> let me ree
[2:11:15] <Nested_Dreams> !uptime
[2:11:15] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 11 minutes
[2:11:19] <Nested_Dreams> aww
[2:11:38] <@Solidus_113> Mouse wheel auto scrolls through all weapons, if you want a confirmation before the swap you can turn off fast weapon switch
[2:11:49] <natebud> @Javaa01 You're arguing against canon in a dumb video game
[2:12:02] <+GrislyBoar> Wait, there's a fast weapon switch option? How did I not notice that?
[2:12:13] <Visorak6> its melee sidearms long arms explosives iirc
[2:12:14] <dukenux> It JUST works
[2:12:15] <%GeneralSCPatton> @javaa01 The headcrab is stabilizing their vitals in some way
[2:12:16] <%GraceTBM> @WoolieVersus You can select a weapon "pair" by turning off fast weapon switch and using last weapon used
[2:12:23] <+Lizard0TM> is Woolie playing M&K now?
[2:12:31] <IAmCaligvla> yes
[2:12:35] <%GraceTBM> woolz is using hybrid controls
[2:12:36] <+croxeye> woolie is playing mouse and cotnroller
[2:12:36] <%GeneralSCPatton> @lizard0tm Nope, the HYBRID
[2:12:41] <+GrislyBoar> I could've been switching my stuff all old school DOOM style when I was playing.
[2:12:41] <@Solidus_113> M&C
[2:12:42] <IAmCaligvla> actually more like mouse and abomination
[2:12:42] <Haarute> he's playing abomination.
[2:12:45] <%Javaa01> The head crab is animating the nervous system and giving the muscles commands
[2:12:48] <dukenux> just m+k, or m+gamepad?
[2:12:50] <This_is_Marco> get nommed on
[2:12:54] <+Lizard0TM> Oh
[2:12:55] <+croxeye> go to max!!!
[2:12:57] <andrei11dr> I wish they just added a weapon wheel in this remake
[2:13:15] <IAmCaligvla> monkaS
[2:13:18] <%GraceTBM> the weapon selection menu is effective, simple, and iconic

[2:13:25] <unit24> good instincts woolie
[2:13:28] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[2:13:30] <+Lizard0TM> It's not impossible to add a weapon wheel, there's one in GMod
[2:13:42] <king_trito> just got done playing Splinter Cell chaos theory, they have a half life reference
[2:13:46] <dfs_k> wollie avoiding the excitement at ALL COST
[2:13:47] <%Th3SmartAlec> So I started blasting
[2:13:47] <natebud> Its actually better if you stay on it, since you dont have to fight these guys
[2:13:55] <+GrislyBoar> @GraceTBM Well, at least they have a sort of weapon menu categorization system when fast switching is off.
[2:13:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> @javaa01 They scream in agony, crying out for help and/or death, in reverse. They are super conscious and alive in there.
[2:14:16] <Fenlig> Face fucking the enemy :D
[2:14:21] <%Javaa01> The full zombies do
[2:14:26] <%GraceTBM> precisely, boar, fast weapon switch is better for people who know the rotation
[2:14:26] <+Lizard0TM> Head Crab Zombies in HL2 BEG fore death
[2:14:29] <@Solidus_113> Woolie wants to Super Dash
[2:14:37] <%NWannabe> doesn't woolie call out minh in vanquish for that style?
[2:14:38] <%Javaa01> The half zombies very rarely make any noise beyond gurgling
[2:14:52] <andrei11dr> Woolie is still trying to glory kill the enemy's
[2:14:53] <natebud> Their aim is really bad, you can just stand in the open most of the time
[2:15:02] <%Th3SmartAlec> LEAVER
[2:15:03] <+croxeye> oh man, lets see if woolie sets himself back after he avoided the thing
[2:15:05] <Visorak6> rebel 1
[2:15:17] <+GrislyBoar> Leaver? I hardly knew 'er!
[2:15:24] <%GraceTBM> you don't have to come back up to where you are

[2:16:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> You would think the HEV suit would have more Oxygen
[2:16:51] <+GrislyBoar> I like how this remake streamlined so much of the original game without making it feel too linear.
[2:16:52] <+croxeye> no sonic water music tho

[2:17:08] <natebud> You can drown for like a minute and a half in this game
[2:17:13] <%Th3SmartAlec> @GraceTBM Oh you're right LUL
[2:17:14] <IAmCaligvla> @Th3SmartAlec there's a scientist at the start that mentions that they removed the oxygen feature in an earlier version of it
[2:17:32] <+Lizard0TM> Has Woolie ever played Synthetik: Legion Rising? It's absolutely his style I think
[2:17:33] <%GraceTBM> the remake cut out a lot of the stupdi nonsensical level design and puzzles
[2:17:40] <natebud> If you lose health to drowing, it comes back when you surface @WoolieVersus
[2:17:43] <+croxeye> woolie you were going the right way tho
[2:17:45] <+Rabbitmage> In the original half-life you had like 10 seconds
[2:18:02] <+croxeye> woolie, get in the hole
[2:18:16] <%GraceTBM> you had less time, but the level design was so much simpler that you usually knew exactly where to go
[2:18:17] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie
[2:18:20] <%GraceTBM> go down the hole woolz
[2:18:21] <Visorak6> the woolie hole awaits

[2:23:00] <+croxeye> it's in the shark tank
[2:23:00] <%GraceTBM> in the cage above the water
[2:23:02] <%Th3SmartAlec> Where could the crowbar be?
[2:23:06] <%GraceTBM> you're stuck on the ground

[2:23:12] <natebud> You were supposed to die down here, but they made this enemy too easy
[2:23:13] <%GraceTBM> it disappeareD!@!!
[2:23:14] <%Th3SmartAlec> IT WAS A GHOST
[2:23:18] <derap41> Ever tried swinging something underwater? not that easy
[2:23:22] <natebud> There's like a path somewhere to go up
[2:23:27] <andrei11dr> Shoot him
[2:23:31] <%GraceTBM> you might be able to return after a little progression
[2:23:34] <Haarute> you're not 'supposed' to die down here.
[2:23:35] <%NWannabe> but holy crowbar don't care
[2:23:35] <%Th3SmartAlec> Push the barrel?
[2:23:42] <lotharrio> Physics!
[2:23:46] <+croxeye> yeahthere's a regular doorway underwater near where you entered that leads back up @WoolieVersus
[2:23:49] <derap41> Why is there a shark cage here
[2:23:52] <awalr> just jiggle your way out, the true source way
[2:23:54] <%GeneralSCPatton> Cheer500 And with this crowbar victory, the sea has been claimed as the domain of man. All that is left is to defeat birds while skydiving to claim our ascension over them.
[2:23:55] <Pat212> Barrel is the only way
[2:23:55] <natebud> There's a way to get back to where you started, doorway underwater
[2:23:56] <%Th3SmartAlec> Barrel seems to be working
[2:23:58] <IAmCaligvla> sv_cheats 1 and the noclip
[2:24:01] <+Mr_Pylon> It's in the cage
[2:24:03] <%GraceTBM> @WoolieVersus progress with the underwater valve and you can go back
[2:24:03] <+tussletoes> there's a little underwater passage that takes you back up if I remember correctly
[2:24:04] <natebud> @WoolieVersus doorway behind you
[2:24:04] <UnfilteredComic> Itsin that cage
[2:24:06] <Haarute> shark cage
[2:24:10] <natebud> @WoolieVersus underwater doorway

[2:24:20] <%Tearonex> @WoolieVersus check cage
[2:24:30] <IAmCaligvla> sv_cheats 1 and the noclip
[2:24:30] <%Th3SmartAlec> was that beeping in the game?
[2:24:33] <Pat212> Gotta bunny hop around the corner
[2:24:40] <+croxeye> yes that beeping was in the game
[2:24:44] <%Javaa01> You can get to it from the valve door I think
[2:24:46] <%GraceTBM> @WoolieVersus use the underwater valve and you can go back after progressing
[2:24:47] <natebud> @WoolieVersus underwater doorway leads back up
[2:24:48] <Visorak6> kill barnacle and sprint crouch jump
[2:24:50] <+croxeye> just shoot the barnacle
[2:24:50] <+Rabbitmage> use the tongue guys to jump off
[2:24:51] <+GrislyBoar> @Th3SmartAlec Yep. It's the power suit you're wearing. It's literal plot armor.
[2:24:53] <derap41> hmm
[2:24:56] <%Th3SmartAlec> @croxeye thanks it sounded like it was coming from somewhere else
[2:24:57] <derap41> how to get to that cage
[2:25:01] <%Irridium> shoot the barnicles and you can sprint jump
[2:25:10] <+Lizard0TM> Just put the barrel against the wall
[2:25:15] <Edible_Enthusiasm> do you even have guns
[2:25:17] <+Mr_Pylon> Go get that box
[2:25:20] <+MrRabbles> behold the power of one guy
[2:25:21] <%Javaa01> Just use the door you opened
[2:25:24] <TheHotStuven> Not just Source, Source 2!
[2:25:25] <%GraceTBM> @WoolieVersus JUST PROGRESS AND YOU CAN GO BACK
[2:25:26] <+hakma> @Edible_Enthusiasm no gun run
[2:25:28] <%Javaa01> It leads back up
[2:25:31] <natebud> @WoolieVersus underwater doorway
[2:25:39] <IAmCaligvla> just reload at this point
[2:25:40] <+gerdbird98> Grab the crate!

[2:27:16] <+aishman> TO THE REAL SNIPER
[2:27:17] <%GeneralSCPatton> THAT'S YOUR SNIPER RIFLE
[2:27:18] <+GrislyBoar> octoPerfect
[2:27:20] <UnfilteredComic> Usually youre supposed to jump the gap, fall into the cage, pick up the crossbow, then fight it under water
[2:27:24] <IAmCaligvla> bolts not arrows
[2:27:27] <natebud> Crossbow kills alien grunts in ONE SHOT in this game
[2:27:29] <+tussletoes> There was this whole thing with that cage and the crossbow but I guess you can crowbar it in the face in this difficulty
[2:27:29] <%Javaa01> But it's not as good for sniping long range, since the bolts have travel time
[2:27:30] <Man_F_Artwish> Jpg scope
[2:27:33] <unit24> the HL2 crossbow is the shit
[2:27:34] <derap41> Sniper Gordon
[2:27:39] <%Javaa01> The shots aren't hitscan
[2:27:42] <DedlokPM> https://clips.twitch.tv/DoubtfulAbstruseMouseKeyboardCat
[2:27:49] <%GraceTBM> hl2 crossbow is so conceptually cool
[2:27:51] <Explodincatz> crossbow is brokenly strong in Black Mesa
[2:27:53] <natebud> @tussletoes any difficulty
[2:27:59] <+GrislyBoar> @Javaa01 Yeah, it's a fair trade for how strong it is.
[2:28:08] <andrei11dr> Iea ,with Woolies aim im sure the sniper will be great Kappa
[2:28:08] <Visorak6> it was in the cage now its where you found it
[2:28:08] <TheHotStuven> it was in the cage, and it drops into the water
[2:28:10] <+DreyfussFrost> Yes it was.
[2:28:15] <%GraceTBM> @WoolieVersus it's in both locations
[2:28:20] <+croxeye> it's still in the cage too, that's just there if you miss it i guess
[2:28:24] <derap41> In old is was in the game
[2:28:27] <cheesedburgers> HL2 crossbow is the fucking strong but this one ainâ€™t bad
[2:28:29] <+GrislyBoar> But you already killed the big fish, so whatevs. lucidShrug
[2:28:35] <Man_F_Artwish> Jump on the box!
[2:28:40] <%Th3SmartAlec> JUMP
[2:28:40] <StarlitStunner> @gracetbm the heated rebar launcher crossbow is great
[2:28:49] <+croxeye> so @WoolieVersus the crossbow is the only gun that can fire underwater, good to know for later
[2:28:52] <%GraceTBM> i think HL2 and BM crossbows are similar strength, the design in 2 was just super cool
[2:29:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> they didnt like that
[2:29:04] <+GrislyBoar> @cheesedburgers Imagine getting shot with red hot rebar from a modded crossbow. Ouch.
[2:29:05] <%GraceTBM> @croxeye pistol fires underwater too
[2:29:06] <derap41> @StarlitStunner did you see the irl one they made its awesome

[2:29:22] <popcultureaficionado> use the shotgun
[2:29:24] <+TreeeFOX> stand in front of enemy. good one
[2:29:48] <+GrislyBoar> I think some of the sound bytes of the Vorts are from Lou Gosset Jr's clips in HL2.
[2:29:48] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1239789488349614081?s=20
[2:29:50] <popcultureaficionado> or magnum
[2:29:51] <andrei11dr> Just shoot them :)
[2:30:02] <%Irridium> crossbow big strong
[2:30:07] <%GraceTBM> @WoolieVersus have you ever considered using ASDF on keyboard?
[2:30:20] <natebud> just strafe or pick up a barrel, their aim has been ruined
[2:30:26] <%GraceTBM> @WoolieVersus You used to fall into a broken crate and then they spawned around you
[2:30:30] <%Javaa01> Yeah, it's a trap if you decide to skip the barnacles and just jump directly onto the box
[2:30:34] <+croxeye> the almighty crowbar
[2:30:40] <IAmCaligvla> crowbar those cyclops suckers
[2:30:54] <popcultureaficionado> i will shut my mouth crowbar is superior
[2:30:59] <IAmCaligvla> shame he missed the cage segment though
[2:31:00] <TheHotStuven> Old video games PepeHands
[2:31:02] <natebud> But they redesigned the room, so why would you ever jump on the box?
[2:31:05] <lotharrio> You got a marine in a box in an earlier session.
[2:31:11] <+croxeye> now remember to jump this time
[2:31:15] <%GraceTBM> you jump on the box to avoid the barnacles
[2:31:17] <Man_F_Artwish> Poor vortigaunts :(
[2:31:19] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[2:31:20] <+GrislyBoar> I think Woolie's just a god with the crowbar and doesn't realize it.
[2:31:28] <derap41> Has Woolie ever had a good look at those Aliens?
[2:31:34] <+croxeye> nothing

[2:32:21] <IAmCaligvla> crouch jump
[2:32:23] <awalr> pfft
[2:32:27] <%GraceTBM> at least it doesn't shock you anymore
[2:32:32] <%Th3SmartAlec> Freeman's too thick
[2:32:35] <dukenux> with a cape
[2:32:39] <+MrRabbles> Gordan just slams into a fence face first
[2:32:40] <IAmCaligvla> Jebaited
[2:32:41] <%Th3SmartAlec> Jebaited
[2:33:06] <%GraceTBM> that double shotgun gib is so iconic for BM
[2:33:08] <+GrislyBoar> @Th3SmartAlec I mean, anyone who's watched Gorgeous Freeman knows how thicc those cheeks are. Kappa
[2:33:10] <dukenux> you can tell it's a water level by all this BAIT
[2:33:16] <%NWannabe> crates
[2:33:27] <dukenux> this sounds like a Lorn piece
[2:33:29] <%Th3SmartAlec> @GrislyBoar It's why only he gets to wear the HEV suit
[2:33:31] <derap41> The Spas is an autoshotgun and they're using it as a pump -_-*
[2:33:42] <+croxeye> oh no woolie, this IS, JUMPING PUZZLE
[2:33:43] <dukenux> Revolver Ocelot
[2:33:55] <natebud> Woolie could have used those boxes to bypass the jumping puzzle LUL
[2:33:58] <+MrRabbles> Jumping boss
[2:34:09] <dukenux> oh shit, this fucking Mario puzzle LUL
[2:34:09] <%Th3SmartAlec> sick
[2:34:11] <+tussletoes> It's like a weird future Spas looking thing. it look different
[2:34:17] <+TimBurkeulosis> spas 12 can be both semi and pump
[2:34:18] <%GraceTBM> @derap41 I've been confused ever since Black Ops: It's clearly functional with the pump, why does it have both semi and pump functions??
[2:34:25] <%Th3SmartAlec> jumping. and puzzles.
[2:34:30] <+GrislyBoar> It's really hard to do puzzle platforming in a first person game, but they managed to pull it off in this one.
[2:34:31] <+Mr_Pylon> Sprint jumping gets you that istance
[2:34:40] <natebud> The double barreled SPAS can be fired many ways in real life
[2:34:41] <IAmCaligvla> oh jesus
[2:34:53] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> please crouch jump
[2:35:02] <+croxeye> @Mr_Pylon it looks like he's set it to always run, the superiour form of movement in this game
[2:35:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> PogChamp
[2:35:03] <%GraceTBM> auto crouch jump is on
[2:35:05] <IAmCaligvla> LUL oh god
[2:35:09] <andrei11dr> I kinda forgot how much platforming was in the first one
[2:35:11] <%Javaa01> It was just a single headcrab
[2:35:12] <+tuchpi> jermaNosewipe
[2:35:15] <Kraahka> He has auto crouch
[2:35:16] <natebud> Did you turn off autocrouch jump woolie?
[2:35:16] <+MrRabbles> shoutout to the people that saw headcrab
[2:35:20] <+GrislyBoar> @GraceTBM That's gotta be handy.
[2:35:28] <UnfilteredComic> @andrei11dr Xen also has shitloads of platforming
[2:35:31] <+croxeye> it was easier in the OG, cuz there were no lips to catch yourself on
[2:35:33] <%GraceTBM> there's no real reason to turn off auto crouch jump except nostalgia
[2:35:33] <derap41> @GraceTBM Glad you asked its meant as a police or SWAT weapon and can needs to be able to use multible types of ammo
[2:35:52] <+prime_name> FPS platforming, always not the best
[2:35:58] <%GraceTBM> derap does pump/semi only work with certain types of ammo?
[2:36:13] <+tussletoes> honestly after playing HL1 and 2 so much, not crouch jumping would feel too strange
[2:36:21] <derap41> @GraceTBM I order for the semi auto to funtion it needs sufficient recoil which lower power ammo can't produce which is why it can be use as a pump
[2:36:23] <IAmCaligvla> @prime_name unless it's mirror's edge
[2:36:24] <andrei11dr> @unfilteredcomic Iea ,but i did Xen once because it sucked in the old one
[2:36:26] <willtheprofessional> the spas 12 is the definition of "tacticool". It looks mean and distinctive.
[2:36:30] <natebud> just ammo
[2:36:32] <+tussletoes> but yeah it's good auto crouch jump is an option
[2:36:33] <+croxeye> nothing
[2:36:34] <Visorak6> ammo
[2:36:35] <%Javaa01> That corner was nothing
[2:36:36] <dukenux> you didnt miss anything
[2:36:36] <+croxeye> you missed nothing
[2:36:39] <%Javaa01> Absolutely nothing
[2:36:40] <%GraceTBM> ah! thanks for the info, @derap41
[2:36:45] <This_is_Marco> @tussletoes I literally crouch jump in every game now
[2:36:49] <natebud> There's crossbow ammo in a room
[2:36:49] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:36:49] <dukenux> Half-life/Black Mesa are pretty linear
[2:37:04] <%GraceTBM> exploration just gives you extra mmo and materials
[2:37:08] <%GraceTBM> no it's the old stuff
[2:37:21] <%Th3SmartAlec> TRAP ROOM
[2:37:21] <derap41> @GraceTBM Also the "hook" on the spas is so that you can sorta hold it with one hand it doesn't really work
[2:37:22] <dukenux> ok nvm it was worth it
[2:37:22] <+GrislyBoar> OOOO, nice.
[2:37:50] <%GraceTBM> it's a hook? I always thought it was a fold out stock a la jurassic park
[2:38:08] <%Javaa01> Ow the Edge
[2:38:17] <Man_F_Artwish> Half life really is the perfect series for vr. Itâ€™s just shoot, puzzle and scavenging
[2:38:20] <+GrislyBoar> Contour sheet?
[2:38:30] <IAmCaligvla> greande time
[2:38:36] <+jiggy_snipe> did Nina design that?
[2:38:37] <IAmCaligvla> or clubbering time
[2:38:37] <derap41> @GraceTBM it has a fold out stock with a hook attachment that can be used both as carry handle and as a weird arm rest

[2:38:41] <IAmCaligvla> nah, grenade time

[2:42:19] <+GrislyBoar> @EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries Controller + mouse.
[2:42:24] <natebud> @EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries controller for movement, mouse for aim.
[2:42:45] <dukenux> Hello, vorts? It's ya boi

[2:43:05] <Man_F_Artwish> I still think the steam controller does a decent job at being a mouse. Gyro is fantastic.

[2:43:11] <derap41> @Th3SmartAlec Yeah the march to Aber was much easier
[2:43:18] <%GraceTBM> I walways changed crouch to q for an easier crouch jump
[2:43:37] <natebud> And they're spacing

[2:53:16] <%GraceTBM> hallway on the right
[2:53:16] <@Solidus_113> Aperture and Black Mesa are rival companies

[3:01:07] <%GraceTBM> i think the game saves multiple quicksaves?
[3:01:20] <This_is_Marco> Outside DansGame
[3:01:21] <GarbageNirvana> Who coulda guessed
[3:01:26] <%GraceTBM> hl1 at least saved three consecutive quicksaves
[3:01:28] <Flare3500> I just caught up does Woolie kill every disposable scientist ?
[3:01:28] <%Th3SmartAlec> @GeneralSCPatton Crowbar Mk II
[3:01:28] <@Solidus_113> who designed this
[3:01:28] <derap41> And back inside
[3:01:28] <Man_F_Artwish> Oh we really get outside.
[3:01:30] <dukenux> remember outside?
[3:01:32] <natebud> autosaves at load doors
[3:01:38] <This_is_Marco> as you should be

[3:02:36] <andrei11dr> "Duel of the Fates starts playing"
[3:02:37] <IAmCaligvla> got nom nom'd
[3:02:43] <derap41> Woolie is a little bit blind
[3:02:48] <+YabbaTroll> lotta meat under that barnacle @WoolieVersus
[3:02:48] <natebud> And then woolie missed another thing
[3:02:55] <%Irridium> nah he got ate
[3:02:58] <%Th3SmartAlec> @andrei11dr Everytime I see that song now all I can think is how they refused to name the movie that
[3:02:59] <BlackOrchidKI> "You will know this Theoretical Physicist's power"
[3:02:59] <%GraceTBM> the timeline isn't 100% contiguous, he definitely disappears and gets replaced by another model
[3:03:00] <+tuchpi> jermaVenus jermaVenus
[3:03:12] <%GraceTBM> don't worry about it he doesn't matter
[3:03:13] <derap41> Barnacle
[3:03:14] <+tussletoes> pretty sure you can't save that guy
[3:03:15] <%Javaa01> You need him to get ate if you want a handgun
[3:03:26] <+tuchpi> LUL
[3:03:27] <This_is_Marco> Source engine is great tho, where else can you grab something stand on it and carry yourself into the sky
[3:03:29] <natebud> you cannot, can't even get a gun from him anymore
[3:03:32] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[3:03:38] <derap41> Literally blind
[3:03:45] <Flare3500> You're being pulled by the dick
[3:03:45] <%GraceTBM> you mean that gun
[3:03:46] <derap41> Walking over the poor dude
[3:04:01] <%GraceTBM> it's survival horror agian! for 8 minutes
[3:04:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> The ammo for your not-Crowbar
[3:04:04] <natebud> @GraceTBM no, you had to wait for the security guard to die to get a gun before
[3:04:05] <IAmCaligvla> all that mountain dew
[3:04:11] <dukenux> Gamer Fuel
[3:04:11] <derap41> This is where they make the green Goop
[3:04:17] <Visorak6> toxic waste in open vats OSHA would have a field day
[3:04:21] <+tussletoes> Elephant's foot down there
[3:04:22] <+Testfall_V> All this residue. RESIDUE EVIL
[3:04:23] <Flare3500> Pat could be down there shoot him fast
[3:04:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> ewwwww
[3:04:30] <natebud> @GraceTBM try 10 seconds. There's a machine gun in this level now.
[3:04:38] <%jepupu> I swear, the green goo in all the games like this. Industrial complexes sure love uranium salts.
[3:04:43] <%GraceTBM> the catwalks above that toxic goo are clearly up to OSHA standards
[3:04:49] <xeros720> i want to say the crowbar doesn't solve all your problems
[3:04:53] <xeros720> but it does solve most of them
[3:04:55] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:05:10] <+tussletoes> the black mesa nickelodeon slime plant
[3:05:17] <dukenux> This whole place would give OSHA people eyes on the inside
[3:05:18] <%TheFaustianMan> @Visorak6 You being up a good point. What kind of biomedical lab is run like this? Is this Wuhan China?
[3:05:19] <derap41> yum radioactive goop
[3:05:20] <%GraceTBM> the one thing in this game the crowbar definitely can't do is the Xen final pre boss sequence
[3:05:27] <%Th3SmartAlec> huh
[3:05:32] <%GraceTBM> duke LUL
[3:05:36] <@Solidus_113> yeah this part kinda sucks
[3:05:49] <IAmCaligvla> @GraceTBM just gotta use noclip, then it's viable Kappa
[3:06:00] <derap41> @TheFaustianMan You mean the literal Umnrella lab?
[3:06:05] <%TheFaustianMan> radiation is a myth
[3:06:05] <OldManDeckardCain> @GraceTBM not with that attitude LUL
[3:06:09] <%GraceTBM> I love how there's the horrible broken leaking green goo coming from a vat in the tram sequence BEFORE EVERYTHING GOES TO SHIT
[3:06:11] <+TheHolyTyrone> Hazardous materials Pog
[3:06:16] <Flare3500> A lot of Half Life one level kinda suck , aged really bad
[3:06:17] <%Th3SmartAlec> is this a dead end?
[3:06:17] <mMayrro> hit the walls to check for secrets Kappa
[3:06:20] <%TheFaustianMan> @derap41 RIGHT!
[3:06:38] <natebud> Woolie will be so lost when he starts opening the shortcuts in this level

[3:08:24] <natebud> Reggie on ladderwatch
[3:08:25] <%GraceTBM> @WoolieVersus you used to have to do a bunch of jumping puzzles on spinning stirrers in the vats

[3:08:57] <%Javaa01> Nope
[3:09:02] <%Javaa01> It's just platforming
[3:09:03] <%GraceTBM> your only fight is with the toxic goop
[3:09:05] <@Solidus_113> stank zone
[3:09:06] <%Th3SmartAlec> looks like a platforming puzzle to me
[3:09:08] <rsg220> not good, not terrible
[3:09:09] <natebud> look out woolie, they're right behind you
[3:09:11] <Zeemod155> A fight against platforming
[3:09:12] <GraceTBM> your fight in this room is with gravity and timing
[3:09:12] <%Th3SmartAlec> which is a fight for Woolie to be sure
[3:09:13] <xeros720> does look like a doom room
[3:09:17] <derap41> Radioactive glow is usually blue not green but radium made everyone thing it should be green
[3:09:22] <dukenux> "I can smell you"
[3:09:27] <theKingRamses> that's the radiation you're feeling woolie
[3:09:34] <%TheFaustianMan> hears it in his bones. that the gigercounter whoolie
[3:09:39] <square_heed> Ah yes, the black Mesa goo squashers

[3:10:05] <+CavemanInCave> youre a kabal
[3:10:13] <Badgerconda_> valve is so fucking good at making games, I wish they still did it.
[3:10:13] <+CavemanInCave> speed hook boi
[3:10:15] <xeros720> depends on how fast you can iterate
[3:10:25] <derap41> @Badgerconda_ and what is Alyx?
[3:10:28] <dukenux> @derap41 theres is part of the game that has "sorta" Cherenkov radiation effect
[3:10:37] <%GraceTBM> thank god the radiation doesn't hurt you in the room just the goo
[3:10:43] <%TheFaustianMan> Alyx is a nausia sim
[3:10:45] <dukenux> as in you swim in a coolant that's REALLY blue

[3:11:07] <+doc_ock_rokc> @GraceTBM Gordon is wearing a hazardus waste suit
[3:11:09] <%TheFaustianMan> isn't too paitnet just called lazy?

[3:11:24] <derap41> @TheFaustianMan only if you can't handle VR
[3:11:30] <%GraceTBM> @derap41 a prequel game 13 years after the last cliffhanger entry in a different control and display format that's focused on being a good VR game as an example
[3:11:52] <%TheFaustianMan> @derap41 I can handle vr, but my shoes can't handle the puke.
[3:11:53] <natebud> What to expect

[3:12:17] <lotharrio> The game is like a happy puppy. Sometimes it just bites you because it's excited.
[3:12:17] <%GraceTBM> it's a secret empty Gordeon-tube
[3:12:21] <derap41> @GraceTBM All Half life games have been advanced tech demos
[3:12:23] <%Irridium> @derap41 it's less can I handle it and more can I afford a $500-$1000 setup for one game
[3:12:36] <@Solidus_113> cooked
[3:12:41] <%Th3SmartAlec> Well
[3:12:45] <%Th3SmartAlec> that's fun

[3:13:22] <%Th3SmartAlec> ladder
[3:13:24] <%GraceTBM> @derap41 fair point, actually, i think the sentiment is just that we want another mouse and keyboard shooter
[3:13:25] <%Javaa01> Nah that ain't the water monster
[3:13:29] <dukenux> door?
[3:13:31] <%Irridium> @derap41 true. but so far Alyx is the only one so far that made me really want it. Well, Alyx and Rez.
[3:13:47] <Visorak6> water creature and bullsquids arent the same thing
[3:13:51] <Visorak6> despite their names
[3:13:57] <%xeromage> I bet you guys'd like it
[3:14:03] <dukenux> but worse
[3:14:05] <xeros720> pretty much correct, yes
[3:14:06] <StarlitStunner> A map to land on your back
[3:14:06] <%GraceTBM> the disappointing thing to me is that Alyx is in first person, cause I think her design is great to look at
[3:14:08] <%Th3SmartAlec> that works
[3:14:08] <Amardeux> nailed it LUL
[3:14:10] <natebud> ideal

[3:38:27] <unit24> the good news is that things get way better immediately after this chapter
[3:38:30] <mMayrro> oh woolie was using the frankenstein config?
[3:38:31] <%GraceTBM> breakfast being the most important meal was a marketing line by Kellogg's to support their cereal
[3:38:43] <+tuchpi> the apex nightmare set-up LUL
[3:38:51] <arkv01> apex steup is only for ESPORTS
[3:38:53] <+Grayhammatter> the apex configs though LUL
[3:38:55] <Amardeux> it has come full circle LUL
[3:38:56] <andrei11dr> If it works don't change it
[3:39:00] <sexdrugsvideogames> breakfast is the best, the rest is optional
[3:39:03] <+jiggy_snipe> can't escape crossing nonsense
[3:39:06] <derap41> @GraceTBM Which was made to be the most tasteless boring cereal so you won't jerk it
[3:39:10] <rubbishbinge> gotta run it back
[3:39:12] <Zayasu> just use wasd BibleThump
[3:39:16] <%GraceTBM> Hybrid controls were substantially more fun to watch, and it seems like you're enjoying it more
[3:39:30] <%TheFaustianMan> can't hit shitwith shotgun, feels like you had more control.
[3:39:37] <+Ancopro> LOL
[3:39:40] <arkv01> yeah I feel you, wasd sucks
[3:39:43] <%GraceTBM> @WoolieVersus have you ever tried ASDF???
[3:39:44] <+jiggy_snipe> Woolie do you
[3:39:45] <Zayasu> then make it ijkl :)
[3:39:47] <derap41> Woolie get a special gamer keyboard
[3:39:48] <alrobot2014> how do you feel about esdf or ijkl
[3:39:55] <sighman55> Woolie SAD
[3:39:56] <+Sovspot> the fuck are you using? arrow keys?
[3:40:00] <sexdrugsvideogames> its fine
[3:40:00] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:40:08] <%Javaa01> You don't need much dexterity for a regular shooter
[3:40:09] <BlackOrchidKI> PC Master Race forever Kappa
[3:40:10] <arkv01> gamepad stick
[3:40:13] <+YabbaTroll> @Sovspot omg you dont know
[3:40:14] <lotharrio> I never use wasd. I'm a controller-shit-baby, myself.
[3:40:14] <OBS_VinnieK> I am the same way as Woolie I haaatee WASD
[3:40:14] <mMayrro> do the claw hold on the keyboard Kappa
[3:40:17] <+TheFaustianMan> use a wii steering wheel
[3:40:17] <Visorak6> its fine just get good at mouse aim and who cares
[3:40:18] <valriot> if you cant do shift or ctrl, then yeah theres no point using WASD
[3:40:21] <%Javaa01> But Warframe will make your pinky finger big and strong
[3:40:22] <andrei11dr> Use an arcade stick
[3:40:26] <This_is_Marco> thats understandable
[3:40:29] <natebud> Your pinky rests on shift
[3:40:30] <%GraceTBM> @WoolieVersus some pro keyboarders use ASDF and you just get used to a flat row
[3:40:30] <%Th3SmartAlec> FPS with an arcade stick PogChamp
[3:40:31] <derap41> I see
[3:40:32] <+Caidezes> Who cares? Just play your way. That's the beauty of PC gaming: you can use whatever you want.
[3:40:35] <+Ancopro> gimme a steering wheel and a rockband guitar
[3:40:36] <%TheFaustianMan> wii stearing wheel!
[3:40:42] <sexdrugsvideogames> nunchak for stick
[3:40:43] <+tuchpi> DO THE THING jermaSun
[3:40:56] <+jiggy_snipe> @Caidezes lies, do it only one way Kappa
[3:40:58] <This_is_Marco> @GraceTBM that setup hurts my brain
[3:40:59] <stanlychicken> A hitbox doesn't really require you to use your pinky
[3:41:08] <valriot> I like WASD, but the whole 123456 ect for weapons kills me, i had to put weapons on F, T, Q and \ in Doom Eternal
[3:41:08] <BlackOrchidKI> I remember a time where I used Ctrl and Alt to strafe around in FPS games. I don't understand young me anymore.
[3:41:22] <andrei11dr> Orse just get the Steel Battalion controller Kappa
[3:41:33] <CursedNobleman> @andrei11dr LUL
[3:41:34] <arkv01> @BlackOrchidKI smaller hands
[3:41:48] <%GraceTBM> @valriot I can't remember all of those AND the other bindings so i can only use 1-3 and therefore the low tier weapons fall by the wayside
[3:42:00] <BlackOrchidKI> That oughta' do it.
[3:42:13] <%GraceTBM> @WoolieVersus thanks again for switching!
[3:42:29] <IAmCaligvla> rip uderzo :'(
[3:42:29] <sexdrugsvideogames> f
[3:42:31] <valriot> @GraceTBM 1 and 2 are the worst for me, cos its right above W, which is the movement finger so blehhhh
[3:42:31] <mMayrro> D:

[3:43:03] <sexdrugsvideogames> no puns in english
[3:43:08] <ToneBacas> dogma works then
[3:43:20] <%ozzrabbit> Itâ€™s also Idefix in German.
[3:43:32] <+Grayhammatter> FutbolSlim

[3:51:48] <EileenTheCrowe> Is there a link to this outro on youtube
[3:52:07] <+nobotie> Disregard women.
[3:52:08] <+Grayhammatter> auhguhuahguhgauhg
[3:52:34] <+nobotie> Koality JPN voice acting.
[3:52:41] <+Grayhammatter> O.o o.O BISON!
[3:52:41] <andrei11dr> Kira just watched his own anime..
[3:52:44] <FeelinNifty> O_o
[3:52:47] <+ttvp> I want Woolieâ€™s outro to loop infinitely in my dreams
[3:53:13] <+nobotie> I need to know where that space clip is from so I can show all the sub lovers.
[3:53:36] <andrei11dr> Its Gundam SEED
[3:53:41] <This_is_Marco> its like gundam seed or something
[3:53:42] <+Grayhammatter> aaauuuuW

[3:54:06] <+OmegaWeltall> SNK Sidekicks in french i think
[3:54:15] <+nobotie> @This_is_Marco Thank you
[3:54:16] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1239789488349614081?s=20
[3:54:44] <+Aniki_Tony> Jan 6th?
[3:54:50] <+Grayhammatter> SourPls
[3:54:54] <DarknessD42> SourPls
[3:55:24] <%jepupu> I never get bored of the namco x capcom intro
[3:55:29] <+nobotie> Me too
[3:55:35] <+nobotie> As someone who plays Project x Zone
[3:55:51] <+Aniki_Tony> Captain Commando!
[3:56:01] <andrei11dr> To bad the game itself bored the fuck out me
[3:56:25] <+nobotie> I like the combat, music, and the in-game wiki. That's about it.
[3:56:30] <+Aniki_Tony> is Jin Satomoe in this game?
[3:56:41] <+nobotie> The story and the interactions were absolute garbage.
[3:57:04] <+nobotie> I also will n ever forgive them for not letting me make my our pairings.
[3:57:26] <+Aniki_Tony> oooh.
[3:57:28] <andrei11dr> It was even slower than Super Robot Wars ,and those are slow as fuuuuuuuuuuuuck
[3:57:30] <castcola> AT LONG LAST
[3:57:31] <+Grayhammatter> return to TRASH
[3:57:32] <FallenVerto81> What a trash pile...
[3:57:58] <+Aniki_Tony> Bye Woolz....
[3:58:06] <%jepupu> Like they've said, the idea of crossovers is usually better than crossovers themselves
[3:58:15] <+nobotie> You are telling me. Missions take upwards of an hour and that's mosatly spent waiting on the enemy to make a move.
[3:58:16] <%jepupu> Good night!
[3:58:18] <FeelinNifty> bon gar-bage
[3:58:23] <andrei11dr> Wow ,Woolie changed clothes really quick
[3:58:26] <+nobotie> Ski;pping enemy turns should be a standard feauture.
[3:58:28] <+ttvp> I think woolie deserves a little more than a trash pile these days
[3:58:29] <+RPG_CHICAGO> THE REPEAT

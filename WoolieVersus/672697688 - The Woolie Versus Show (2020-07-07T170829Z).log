[1:01:39] <Venchair> Hp and FP plus are a minor way to respec
[1:01:42] <noe_juan_kanobe> Not worth it, IMO
[1:01:43] <%blaze__drag> it's basically respecing a level
[1:01:46] <%jinking79> just pick a top tier

[1:02:00] <JoviLovesYou> Grind some more and buy them all, coward.
[1:02:01] <%chosenjuan42> 3 bp is the same as 5hp when you level
[1:02:03] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> 50 for max
[1:02:04] <+the_krypto_knight> We’ve is purely better if you have the hp and fp badges available. It just means you can trade the stat boos whenever
[1:02:04] <vaderxyz1970> The 50 option is perminate
[1:02:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> The HP and FP Badges give one level worth while using one level of BP. They're basically a flexible respec.

[1:13:15] <+Sliverits> Woolie's entire strategy seems to revolve around resource efficiency
[1:13:18] <niozonbi> You already have attack up P anyways

[1:16:48] <hassanico2> 21 BP goddamn
[1:17:08] <hassanico2> How does sorting badges work?
[1:17:08] <+Lazyjoules> Drop happy heart would be my pixk
[1:17:11] <DopeyDragon> Battle Olympus is apparently the name of an NES gamr
[1:17:14] <%brachydios777> One of my favorite quotes from the Black Dynamite show is “ Deal while you can cause that light turned mother fucking green. Bye bitch!”
[1:17:15] <%chosenjuan42> Sort that screen
[1:17:15] <%lewdskeletor13> Woolie is stalling so he doesn’t have to ruin his throat with the Vince voice
[1:17:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> WHATS FIRE DRIVE
[1:17:21] <Shadope342> and yet he requires MORE bp
[1:17:22] <+Fnir> Battle Olympus ? umu umu
[1:17:25] <%krispen_wa> I've come to declare war on those who would sell drugs to the community
[1:17:26] <%SomersaultJustice> take off happy heart
[1:17:27] <%ekodrop> battle of olympus is a nes game
[1:17:29] <%cobalt_phoenix_> sorry caps
[1:17:29] <warp_zoner> YO FIRE DRIVE IS BEST
[1:17:31] <+AsinPersuasion> never enough bp
[1:17:33] <Drusain> Fire Drive does an attack to everyone + burn
[1:17:37] <rwbyfan25> you can take off power bounce cause you barely
[1:17:49] <warp_zoner> Fire drive is worth it
[1:17:49] <Run44forrest> do you really need hp plus
[1:17:52] <damienlunas> BP for the BP God
[1:17:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> when did he get fire drive?
[1:18:00] <SixthSun2> Psst, maybe sort your badges?
[1:18:01] <%LoVezineTheAir> fire drive is crazy good
[1:18:06] <$tkuwari> HP PLUS is a waste
[1:18:08] <noe_juan_kanobe> Can't badges be rearranged?
[1:18:08] <extradopeness> But Black Dynamite, I sell drugs to the community!
[1:18:13] <Esparsenior> BP is king. It can give you HP or FP
[1:18:24] <warp_zoner> Fire drive basically breaks ground level fights
[1:18:28] <Venchair> Chaaaarge
[1:18:30] <damienlunas> Z-Button to sort
[1:18:43] <%chosenjuan42> partner
[1:18:54] <SpeedyCloud17> quick change takes a lot :o
[1:18:54] <%GeneralSCPatton> Always take BP. The HP Plus and FP Plus Badges are basically respecs.
[1:18:54] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:18:55] <%chosenjuan42> Mario has more options
[1:19:04] <+the_krypto_knight> The hp recharge usually doesn’t amount to that much healing anyway. Better to bulk heal and it’s specials or items
[1:19:04] <twieetcha> CoolCat
[1:19:10] <hassanico2> It's Free Turns isn't it?
[1:19:12] <%DatAsuna> it's non optional
[1:19:13] <+Dimfish> by far
[1:19:13] <+Sliverits> best badge in both games
[1:19:13] <SpeedyCloud17> !MOTIVATED
[1:19:13] <@Moobot> 1385 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[1:19:13] <Solidnick18> keep that
[1:19:14] <dinosiurry> "O.J., you better be careful with that knife, or one day you might write a book about how you allegedly took some white bitch’s life!"
[1:19:16] <DopeyDragon> Quick Change is essential
[1:19:17] <Solidnick18> it's the best
[1:19:20] <%astrofalcon1> quick tag
[1:19:32] <Solidnick18> looks good
[1:19:32] <+GrassCannon> swap out W Emblem Kappa
[1:19:37] <%brachydios777> @extradopeness I can always appreciate a Chocolate gitty uuup quote
[1:19:41] <glass_marcus> Take off power bounce

[1:20:19] <+Dundee15> Technically you don't need to put levels in HP or FP if you're willing to spend money on those HP and FP badges. You'll get more customization in the long run but it will drain your coins buying those badges.
[1:20:21] <bbblaketwitching> sorry, Zess-T

[2:20:24] <%SirGO0SE> that sucks so fucking much
[2:20:25] <bbblaketwitching> I'm sorry that thats happening
[2:20:26] <%Proxzo> did she lose anything like medicine?
[2:20:28] <+Jessie_Lockhart> People are asshoels
[2:20:29] <KingSuje> i feel unloved
[2:20:30] <%cdrom321> Probably following the delivery vehicle.
[2:20:31] <xUrbanCarnage> Woolie! Since ur playing old GameCube gems, have you ever played the 2.5D action platformer/punchout-like/ Rhythm game known as Donkey Kong Jungle Beat?
[2:20:32] <%SirGO0SE> yo thats a hustle
[2:20:35] <Solidnick18> it does happen
[2:20:36] <%Tadashi047> sometimes possible

[2:20:49] <noe_juan_kanobe> I want thise asshole to get glitter bomb'd or some shit
[2:20:49] <Cynical_Canadian> It's happened before. They take the picture and then take the package
[2:20:50] <%DatAsuna> but yeah fuck em
[2:20:52] <+gespenst25> its probably the Montreal package Mafia
[2:20:52] <%SomeSageAdvice> and those food delivery people sure like taking stuff that doesnt belong to them like FOOD
[2:20:54] <heart_ablaze> I hope there is a special circle in hell for package stealers
[2:20:56] <%brachydios777> Something about petty thieves that especially piss me off
[2:20:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> Just put a medusa head in a fake package to prank those package thieves.
[2:20:58] <+tigerfang86> WHO WOULD STEAL DURING QUARENTINE

[2:21:13] <%RedoctoberWolf> Yo make sure you don't get your VR headset stolen
[2:21:17] <+Jessie_Lockhart> The food delivery is more likely since its from another company. Package delivery less likely. But its still possible.
[2:21:17] <+Grayhammatter> that's fucked
[2:21:20] <KingSuje> i'd steal a body splash
[2:21:22] <Prevot> fuck that's right, fuckers are out during quarantine stealing shit

[2:21:30] <Mr_Ease> Yeah imagine if that was your occulus
[2:21:36] <Cynical_Canadian> That's why you need a door camera to catch them
[2:21:37] <Solidnick18> sadly
[2:21:42] <Mr_Ease> holy shit bullet dodged
[2:21:46] <%ChoculaUltra> that's why I try to never order shit around Black Friday - Holiday Season. It gets super bad around that time.
[2:21:47] <bbblaketwitching> and courage
[2:21:49] <+Jessie_Lockhart> People put in more work to steal and be lazy than to actually put in some work

[2:22:45] <Solidnick18> trash bag people
[2:22:47] <bbblaketwitching> that is truly a large shame
[2:22:58] <%SirGO0SE> @cobalt_phoenix_ you're only responsible for your own imo
[2:23:00] <+harrisboe> @dinnydanny777 Decency should be the default. Only treat someone badly if they show they don’t deserve decency
[2:23:01] <%SomersaultJustice> boo that person!
[2:23:01] <+regis_j_rock> @NopeBadguy I think it just keeps going, I remember losing once

[2:23:33] <%starzo0> I PUT IT BACK EVERY TIME
[2:23:34] <%dinnydanny777> @harrisboe I mean, I've seen those videos of the "Karen's" we have people like that in our society as well
[2:23:35] <%hawk_rush> FUCK PEOPLE WHO LEAVE THEIR SHOPPING CART
[2:23:38] <@Commando_Joe> what about the people that take the shopping cart home? @WoolieVersus
[2:23:39] <benbag13> talk to wrestlers

[2:23:40] <%DatAsuna> ALWAYS RETURN IT UOU FUCKS
[2:23:41] <%ringabal> THOSE FUCKERS TAKE SO MANY PARKING SPOTS
[2:23:44] <Nekros4442> THATS A GOOD TEST
[2:23:44] <thetrashman_sc> THOSE FUCKIN PEOPLE
[2:23:44] <%NopeBadguy> So Bowser just beats you and fucks off LUL
[2:23:44] <%SirGO0SE> its the ultimate test
[2:23:45] <%brachydios777> Put it back every time!
[2:23:47] <Potatoidea> People leave it in the middle of the road?
[2:23:47] <%prime_name> JUST PUT IT BACK ITS NOT HARD
[2:23:48] <Iwashi94> wait people just leave shopping carts?
[2:23:48] <JacktheMan18> I mean, you can be different and be able to treat people decently
[2:23:52] <%Creggamonsta> me and all my homies put the cart back
[2:23:52] <Iwashi94> I never seen that
[2:23:54] <%Livelinne> MercyWing1 woolieREGGIEFUL BegWan
[2:23:54] <JacktheMan18> Oh yeah
[2:23:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> SCUM
[2:23:55] <+Deano8817> assholes do
[2:23:55] <+Grayhammatter> RETURN IT YOU FUCKS
[2:23:56] <%Nomad94> Ha, we don't have that problem in Germany because of the deposit
[2:23:57] <+Jessie_Lockhart> I normally put it back or at the cart spot
[2:23:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> FUCKING SCUM
[2:23:58] <Potatoidea> Yeah
[2:23:58] <%jiggy_snipe> it is an interesting test
[2:23:58] <%Doplghost> arrrrrrrgh people who leave shopping karts
[2:24:00] <+tokenreefer> 90% of the time lol
[2:24:00] <%lewdskeletor13> As someone who worked at a grocery store, fuck those people
[2:24:02] <thetrashman_sc> I WAS PAID TO DO THAT
[2:24:06] <thetrashman_sc> FUCK THOSE PEOPLE
[2:24:06] <Triplicat> stealing the shopping cart is obviously -1/10
[2:24:07] <%SmokerWest> The really good people steal the cart and give it to the homeless.
[2:24:07] <papershuriken_0> having worked as a someone who puts them back, so many people are assholes
[2:24:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> Do you go out of your way to put away someone else's abandoned cart? Extra credit.
[2:24:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> If you leave shopping carts, I should be allowed to key your car.
[2:24:09] <+UberWolfman> FUCK THOSE PEOPLE
[2:24:11] <thetrashman_sc> THEY'RE GARBAGE
[2:24:11] <+mechslayer71> I put it back, it takes 15-30 seconds
[2:24:12] <%gatorafan> DansGame
[2:24:12] <citerel> i don't leave it in the road
[2:24:15] <NotHereToStream> In the UK you need to put a £1 coin into the trolley to use it, so if you leave it out randomly, you lose that £1, so it incentivise people to return the carts
[2:24:18] <%SomersaultJustice> my mom had to pick those up
[2:24:19] <%brachydios777> People need a slap in the face
[2:24:19] <MontresorMeal> Leaving shopping carts at the entrance is chaotic neutral
[2:24:19] <damienlunas> My dad leaves the cart where it is; I can confirm he is an ASSHOLE.
[2:24:20] <papershuriken_0> it's ridiculous
[2:24:23] <+PianoAlone> true
[2:24:25] <%Creggamonsta> putting the cart as a kid was pure bliss
[2:24:26] <tttruest> it is how you act when no one is watching
[2:24:26] <Potatoidea> No law, but you have to live with the guilt of endangering others
[2:24:26] <$tkuwari> its so far tho
[2:24:28] <+Jessie_Lockhart> IF i leave it leave it in a spot that it doesnt block spots or will roll away
[2:24:28] <Esparsenior> The excuse that some else is paid to do it is actual BS.
[2:24:29] <Torgue_1> @thetrashman_sc THOSE PEOPLE GAVE YOU A JOB
[2:24:30] <%Nomad94> @NotHereToStream Same in Germany.
[2:24:32] <%BinaryFireball> Woolie read reddit the other day haha
[2:24:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> No, putting it on the curb doesn't count. TAKE IT BACK TO WHERE IT BELONGS
[2:24:33] <Solidnick18> i always put it back
[2:24:34] <warp_zoner> Well, shit im an asshole
[2:24:38] <+Viaquez> i take back other carts while taking mine backk
[2:24:38] <noe_juan_kanobe> I always had fun putting shopping carts back as a kid
[2:24:39] <%dinnydanny777> Leaving shopping carts outside your house is the peak dickheadery I've seen
[2:24:40] <%starzo0> I WILL
[2:24:41] <+Juriasu> I will
[2:24:42] <%dinnydanny777> Or in a river
[2:24:43] <Gallhint> I had to have medicine for my sick cat shipped to me. It was only high strength antibiotics and a cream to help her appetite. It was stolen. She died. Fuck porch pirates and everything they do. Some of the worst people to ever exist.
[2:24:43] <%Chatterbox1991> that's a lot to read into a shopping cart...
[2:24:44] <%ChoculaUltra> same goes for just holding the door open for people who are clearly behind you and entering the same place
[2:24:44] <Shroomtastic64> Shopping Cart Test is golden. completely agree bois

[2:24:50] <%jiggy_snipe> @Solidnick18 you're a good guy Nick
[2:24:51] <tttruest> even if someone is watching you leave the cart they will look the other way
[2:24:52] <%Invlux> while I'm working
[2:24:52] <%dinnydanny777> I have seen shopping carts in rivers and outside of houses
[2:24:53] <+TheOneCalledRock> what about the people who see the cart pusher and then push the cart TO THEM to put it away?
[2:24:55] <Ookamiden02> Always put it back too
[2:24:56] <%Creggamonsta> ride it back. see it stack up with the other carts
[2:24:58] <NeroInfinite> Yeah, fuckers are literally 2 feet away from the return spot and they just LEAVE the cart out for no reason.
[2:25:01] <%DatAsuna> chatter you're the type who would abandon it
[2:25:05] <%Doplghost> that's why you have the pound coin system in karts. you have to return the kart to get your money back
[2:25:05] <%BinaryFireball> best personality trait indicator is to play a game with them

[2:25:25] <Esparsenior> In England, for most carts you have to put a £1 coin into the cart so it incentive
[2:25:27] <+madtalon> I always put the cart back and if theres one on my way to the corral i grab it too.
[2:25:28] <%almightychad> foolish chat

[2:26:16] <Potatoidea> Always lay TP on the seat in public restrooms if they don't have the plastic covers
[2:26:18] <MontresorMeal> what alignment is leaving a shopping cart in the parking lot, on its side
[2:26:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> STOCKS, put them in THE STOCKS
[2:26:19] <bbblaketwitching> and what is apathy chat?
[2:26:21] <NeroInfinite> I generally do not poop in public, and if I do I never sit on the toilet.

[2:47:27] <Joustar_> psa3guy
[2:47:28] <%RadicalWeegee> TIME TO SELL
[2:47:28] <+tigerfang86> Partners need MORE POWER
[2:47:28] <shiny_prinny> because it's EVERY partner
[2:47:29] <+regis_j_rock> That's the only way to increase Partner HP outside of levels so that's the cost
[2:47:29] <%cdrom321> "Mounted on VIOLENCE"
[2:47:30] <%dinnydanny777> Did you expect it to be free?
[2:47:30] <%ringabal> Koops get cucked again

[2:47:33] <Woodstock_hobbs_> deals 1. 4 damage
[2:47:36] <autcetera> Every partner tho
[2:47:37] <Papa_Bearman> HP Plus P is 6 because it's +5 to all your partners.
[2:47:38] <Esparsenior> BP
[2:47:38] <%LoVezineTheAir> it buffs all your partners tho
[2:47:41] <%blaze__drag> it makes some sense, it buffs like 6 people all for +5 hp
[2:47:43] <skyheys> it's worth more than actual hp +, wtf woolie
[2:47:45] <+regis_j_rock> HP Plus for Mario is just a respec basically
[2:47:49] <bbblaketwitching> 5 hp for all partners is very good
[2:47:49] <terrordriver01> PogCha
[2:47:56] <kingkeldeo31> appeal is pretty useless
[2:47:57] <niozonbi> It's plus 5 to all partners, so it's really +20 right now
[2:48:02] <+pectusumbra> oh, it's ALL partners, yeah, that makes sense
[2:48:03] <+linSP> it’s 5 hp * # of partners
[2:48:18] <skyheys> It's to EVERYONE
[2:48:20] <bbblaketwitching> and in your backround

[2:48:27] <kingkeldeo31> EVERYONE
[2:48:28] <%dinnydanny777> So VIOLENCE gets 15 hp
[2:48:28] <shiny_prinny> yeah not that great, but that's why it's expensive
[2:48:29] <Cynical_Canadian> It's good, but I never found I needed it
[2:48:30] <%ringabal> We in the [REDACTED] vents now
[2:48:33] <exnuart> +20 health
[2:48:34] <skyheys> so that's +20 woolie
[2:48:34] <+Shonen_hero> Deepground ahoy

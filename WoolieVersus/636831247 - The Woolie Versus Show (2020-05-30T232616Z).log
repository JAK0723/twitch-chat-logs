[0:31:00] <+YabbaTroll> yooo this stream is a nice suprise
[0:31:04] <%Th3SmartAlec> ah I see we're currently in Doom's Blighttown
[0:31:15] <pennykettle_> I have to say, the collectibles are not as interesting when you don't get to guess which ___Guy its named
[0:31:17] <RichochetForce> Framerate's not low enough
[0:31:23] <andrei11dr> Pat would definitely become a Mancubis
[0:31:29] <SyLuX45> The only negative is that Flame Hook only drops Armor ONLY with the super Shotgun kill.
[0:31:29] <+TheOneCalledRock> really? dosn't look like the fames are dropping to me OpieOP
[0:31:35] <RichochetForce> @andrei11dr Nonsense, Pat is clearly a Carcass
[0:31:42] <RichochetForce> Their description is 100% Pat's idea of immortality.
[0:31:46] <%Javaa01> And now you can get the cookie
[0:31:52] <%paladinstarbuster> frames? what frames?
[0:32:00] <andrei11dr> Ah ,iea that's right LUL
[0:32:01] <%invader_rin> PINKY
[0:32:02] <ralphfromdk> You can now get the cookie
[0:32:07] <Fart_Explosions> This game with its platforming and double jumping kinda reminds me of Metroid Prime
[0:32:19] <AncelDeLambert> no freeze grenades yet?
[0:32:21] <ralphfromdk> Frost grenade is good for this
[0:32:27] <%Solidnick18> no
[0:32:28] <%Josef_Stryker> LUL
[0:32:28] <RichochetForce> Haha
[0:32:29] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:32:29] <megamonmon123> you can checkpoint explout this pinky
[0:32:30] <gryffinp> paunch
[0:32:31] <BlackermanZX> LUL
[0:32:33] <GokarioRoks> oh no LUL
[0:32:34] <RunningNGunning> LUL
[0:32:37] <+green715> I totally abused the checkpoint here
[0:32:38] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> LUL
[0:32:38] <Calek> this mission is wack
[0:32:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> Checkpoint
[0:32:39] <megamonmon123> you can reload your checkpoint woolie
[0:32:41] <+CryptusMaximus> Reggie The Betrayer
[0:32:43] <brianthe12th> you can load checkpoint here to farm that
[0:32:46] <CoffeeSlice> checkpoint
[0:32:47] <%Javaa01> Yeah at this rate you're gonna have to do that challenge on the replay
[0:32:48] <RunningNGunning> Too strong for challenges
[0:32:48] <ralphfromdk> Reggie was right, it just glow a bit when they lose flesh
[0:32:50] <@Solidus_113> remember that pinkies die to one punch
[0:32:51] <megamonmon123> you can reload farm
[0:32:52] <CoffeeSlice> LUL
[0:32:52] <%Solidnick18> retry
[0:32:53] <%gamewarden92> Pinky lost like 60% of his ass and didn't even flinch
[0:32:58] <MayorRev> reggie pls
[0:32:59] <RichochetForce> This was the hardest challenge in the game for me
[0:33:00] <SyLuX45> Restart Checkpoint if you want to cheese
[0:33:01] <Xxstevo69xX > yeah that challenge is a bit annoying
[0:33:01] <vanillain> this prob has been asked before but what difficulty is woolie playing in
[0:33:03] <RichochetForce> Pinkies die too easily
[0:33:06] <sleepy_pixels> That was the last pinky in the level
[0:33:08] <%paladinstarbuster> you can checkpoint exploit one pinky for the three kills
[0:33:11] <ralphfromdk> And, yes, checkpointing works. Also, you can farm the same pinky for all 3
[0:33:11] <%lewdskeletor13> HMP
[0:33:14] <%Solidnick18> wait until the flashy flash
[0:33:16] <%Irridium> @vanillain hurt me plenty
[0:33:17] <AncelDeLambert> imagine having your spine exposed to air and not even worrying about it
[0:33:39] <Kenny_Riot> GET INTO DEVIL GAMES!
[0:33:44] <%GeneralSCPatton> @anceldelambert This post made by Krogan Gang
[0:33:49] <Hal10k> Important to note that you can unlock everything important without beating every challenge
[0:33:56] <%Josef_Stryker> LUL
[0:33:58] <+YabbaTroll> LUL
[0:33:59] <RichochetForce> This shit
[0:34:00] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> WAT
[0:34:01] <CoffeeSlice> LUL
[0:34:02] <@Solidus_113> too powerful
[0:34:03] <RichochetForce> This stupid ass challenge
[0:34:03] <%invader_rin> TOO STRONG
[0:34:04] <%Irridium> plasma rifle worked best for this I found
[0:34:04] <%Solidnick18> what
[0:34:06] <%Josef_Stryker> Try plasma
[0:34:06] <pennykettle_> Pinkies SUCK in Eternal
[0:34:06] <BlackermanZX> LUL
[0:34:07] <gryffinp> Yeah I had trouble with this challenge too
[0:34:07] <%Solidnick18> too op
[0:34:09] <megamonmon123> cheeeeckpoint
[0:34:10] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[0:34:12] <sleepy_pixels> bug?
[0:34:13] <andrei11dr> Reload again
[0:34:14] <@Solidus_113> plasma will make them explode
[0:34:15] <Ozmodyas> Is this a bug?
[0:34:22] <Calek> @WoolieVersus stop being too good at the game dang
[0:34:22] <RichochetForce> Nope, literally everything is too strong
[0:34:22] <%Irridium> not if you're really careful
[0:34:24] <amonthegodfather> manga readers wats up?
[0:34:25] <raveous> attacking their face is better cuz it does reduced damage, harder to kill on accident
[0:34:27] <heart_ablaze> yeah this challenge sucks
[0:34:28] <megamonmon123> you can do this 2 more times
[0:34:28] <RunningNGunning> This is one of the most frustrating challenges in the game
[0:34:29] <%jubejube56> Clearly you need to grab it by the tail and swing it like bowser
[0:34:32] <%Zebroneath> I think if the final shot is on the tail, it insta kills it.
[0:34:35] <BlackermanZX> hit his face maybe
[0:34:37] <@Solidus_113> don't hit the weak point after the chunks are gone
[0:34:37] <andrei11dr> Just shoot his face until you get it
[0:34:41] <Ozmodyas> I know Pat had a similar problem with a different enemy where glory kill prompts didn't show up
[0:34:45] <+TheOneCalledRock> @Ozmodyas nope. if you do enough damage to their weak point they insta die
[0:34:48] <$legacy0117> lol. Trying to kill a pinkie with a glory kill. LUL
[0:34:57] <raveous> is the plasma rifle weaker? I never felt like it was
[0:35:07] <RunningNGunning> The only challeges more frustrating in the game are the location specific take downs
[0:35:11] <pennykettle_> the red glow is the weak point of an enemy
[0:35:14] <dinnydanny777> Pistol?
[0:35:18] <@Solidus_113> the red glow means you're hitting the weak point
[0:35:22] <RichochetForce> Perfect
[0:35:24] <AncelDeLambert> lol, Woolie cherry-tapped him to death
[0:35:24] <Xxstevo69xX > just keep restarting until u get all glory
[0:35:25] <%Javaa01> Now two DIFFERENT kills
[0:35:29] <%GeneralSCPatton> @dinnydanny777 Pistol doesn't exist any more
[0:35:30] <megamonmon123> now do that 2 more times
[0:35:34] <+endogreen> larrHype larrHype larrHype
[0:35:35] <%MadGioNo> Wait.. dashing into enemies actually damages them?
[0:35:36] <%paladinstarbuster> now checkpoint again
[0:35:37] <andrei11dr> Hopefully there are 2 more
[0:35:39] <RichochetForce> Pistol TECHNICALLY exists
[0:35:41] <gunsrlove> Big wrong
[0:35:42] <RichochetForce> But it requires hacks
[0:35:42] <megamonmon123> yes @madgiono
[0:35:45] <@Solidus_113> you can checkpoint again and it'll save the progress @WoolieVersus
[0:35:46] <$legacy0117> Doomguy JUST HEAD BUTTED A PINKIE TO DEATH.
[0:35:47] <RunningNGunning> @WoolieVersus That was an example of how dashing does damage also
[0:35:47] <+TheOneCalledRock> @MadGioNo yeo
[0:35:49] <megamonmon123> dashing into enemies does damage
[0:35:49] <%GeneralSCPatton> Checkpoint for 2 more
[0:35:51] <%lewdskeletor13> You can load the checkpoint to farm this one pinkie
[0:35:51] <BlackermanZX> can you checkpoint farm the other 2?
[0:35:51] <%Th3SmartAlec> @MadGioNo yeah, you can gib the zombies
[0:35:54] <ralphfromdk> You can checkpoint farm it Woolie
[0:35:56] <gunsrlove> Farm the checkpoint
[0:35:59] <RunningNGunning> just use the checkpoint again
[0:36:00] <pennykettle_> RIP pistol
[0:36:02] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[0:36:05] <+the_vedo_show> atpRtsd
[0:36:06] <pennykettle_> I loved the pistol
[0:36:06] <+green715> I think it has a massive damage multiplier that can bypass glory kill state, but IDK
[0:36:06] <megamonmon123> lol
[0:36:07] <%invader_rin> RIP
[0:36:10] <megamonmon123> one guy

[0:36:11] <Xxstevo69xX > farm it with checkpoint!
[0:36:12] <Dancenorigins> there is a pistol in pc using cheats
[0:36:12] <%NeroInfinite> Shotgun is pistol in this game funnily enough
[0:36:13] <ralphfromdk> Why ignore the gun?
[0:36:13] <%paladinstarbuster> checkpoint again to farm the kill
[0:36:16] <Monkeyweed21> You missed something
[0:36:18] <SyLuX45> Keep using the checkpoint to get the other 2 lol
[0:36:24] <megamonmon123> eh its fine
[0:36:25] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus This challenge is significantly harder since you're at a lower difficulty, and enemies have a lot less health, also you missed the cookie behind the teeth
[0:36:28] <Monkeyweed21> Chaingun unlocked
[0:36:30] <megamonmon123> he can do clean up later
[0:36:33] <ralphfromdk> Both Woolie and Reggie are blind now, we are truely lost :l
[0:36:35] <RichochetForce> Yup, Hugo Martin flat out said the Combat Shotgun is for inducing glory kills
[0:36:36] <%lewdskeletor13> The Tell Tale Heart
[0:36:37] <MayorRev> ewwwww
[0:36:42] <@Solidus_113> left Woolie

[0:37:11] <%mighty_max_t> Hey, Chat. Is the backseat comfy? Lots of cushion and support? Must be with so many people being there
[0:37:15] <Monkeyweed21> Chaingun?
[0:37:18] <%Javaa01> Progress opens up more of the map
[0:37:21] <+TheOneCalledRock> @green715 that is basically it. attacking a demons weakpoint is massive damage and can just flat out kill right away\
[0:37:22] <Dancenorigins> oh he's in this level. I love this levels title
[0:37:27] <%Irridium> @mighty_max_t motherfuckers keep taking the cupholder

[0:40:35] <RichochetForce> Chain Gun > *
[0:40:36] <%kyh9> Apex legends is good shit
[0:40:39] <daemonazaezal> shield is arguably better
[0:40:42] <%kyh9> Gibraltar
[0:40:46] <mdkcde> Check out ROYAl GUARD
[0:40:47] <sniffy77> Then heavy assault rifle is now worthless except for hitting weakpoints
[0:40:48] <%mitchteck> Sheid is op
[0:40:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> Shield is so good
[0:40:58] <+TheOneCalledRock> i would play apex but the games go no solos and fuck playing with randos

[0:41:00] <%Javaa01> Now for progress
[0:41:06] <megamonmon123> i like mobile turret for damage
[0:41:08] <SyLuX45> Both upgrades are really good
[0:41:10] <%kyh9> You should check out the new Apex map at some point!
[0:41:19] <RichochetForce> Yeah, Chain Gun is one of the best in the game
[0:41:23] <megamonmon123> hes on hurt me plenty so either is fine
[0:41:26] <RichochetForce> Awesome default state, awesome upgrades
[0:41:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> Shield lets you focus on removing a threat when there are too many dudes
[0:41:37] <megamonmon123> whats the actual worst weapon in this game? cause all are good

[0:44:03] <RichochetForce> @dinnydanny777 Yes, many of Karen's quotes are corruptions of known sayings
[0:44:04] <Doctoroculat> god this game is so sick
[0:44:04] <megamonmon123> hes not too rusty
[0:44:05] <@Solidus_113> listen to that fucking CHUG

[0:44:22] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[0:44:23] <megamonmon123> he remembered the flame, now all.he has to do is remember about switching grenades
[0:44:25] <%lewdskeletor13> Reggie is welcoming Satan
[0:44:26] <RichochetForce> @pennykettle_ Color theory. Green = Health, Red = Enemies or Damage sources, Purple = Corruption/Evil
[0:44:35] <RichochetForce> Blue = Similar to green, protection
[0:44:36] <+CryptusMaximus> Doomguy needs a DJENTist
[0:44:38] <%Th3SmartAlec> Oof
[0:44:46] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> YEYEYEYEYE
[0:44:59] <Doctoroculat> the jackass bit where they pulled the guys tooth with the ferrari
[0:44:59] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> BBRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
[0:45:00] <%DesertPenguin> It's both
[0:45:01] <+I_of_the_Storm> I’m sure it’s been said but if you let off L2 after you meathook an enemy you drop slowdown and can do a faster zip
[0:45:01] <%paladinstarbuster> I did it it sucked
[0:45:06] <%DesertPenguin> It's offense with defense
[0:45:07] <%Javaa01> Exact same upgrades
[0:45:07] <%Solidnick18> moblie turret Kreygasm
[0:45:10] <%lewdskeletor13> Look Gordon, ropes! We can use these to traverse large pits!
[0:45:12] <%Javaa01> Exact same mastery challenge
[0:45:14] <%GeneralSCPatton> The shield lets you trade evasion for offense
[0:45:15] <+BubbaRands> Glad to see Reggie's back PogChamp
[0:45:20] <+projectmanatees> glad to see reggie again FeelsGoodMan
[0:45:21] <%DesertPenguin> Yea Patton
[0:45:24] <@Solidus_113> back again
[0:45:25] <RichochetForce> That mode is broken
[0:45:28] <%DesertPenguin> Shield lets you stop worrying about mobility for a second
[0:45:29] <dinnydanny777> It's not really offence or defence if you have the shield you can't be shot
[0:45:31] <andrei11dr> Wasn't it like that in the first game?
[0:45:42] <RunningNGunning> It doesn't feel slow now...
[0:45:45] <%paladinstarbuster> check the mastery for the shield
[0:45:47] <%Javaa01> Nothing, absolutely nothing
[0:45:48] <heart_ablaze> @richochetforce alot in this game is broken
[0:45:52] <%Th3SmartAlec> Wow that's metal
[0:45:55] <@Solidus_113> everything is corpses

[0:46:33] <%lewdskeletor13> Well earth does have a lot of people
[0:46:34] <%Solidnick18> find that totem

[0:47:34] <ralphfromdk> No, it was the right way Wools, go down :D
[0:47:38] <RichochetForce> Just fully modeled detail, and textures just enhance what's there.

[0:56:00] <@Solidus_113> CALCULATED
[0:56:02] <pennykettle_> all the glory kills in this game are just the blade stabbing them. :( No more ripping and tearing

[0:56:08] <%invader_rin> He's going to miss that secret out that window
[0:56:09] <megamonmon123> you can super hack.em
[0:56:11] <%KingVantq> i did this to the very first pinky on the level
[0:56:14] <%MrRabbles> this was not a mistake but a profit
[0:56:16] <%Javaa01> if you wanna grind this out, the best place to do it is right after the first arena fight in this mission
[0:56:21] <Invertin> you could do this in Doom 2016 as well by the way
[0:56:23] <Doctoroculat> i remember doing the same for the multikills you needed for the super shotgun upgrade in doom 2016
[0:56:24] <BlackermanZX> all according to keikaku
[0:56:24] <%lewdskeletor13> You could do the same in 2016 too
[0:56:24] <+GrassCannon> Hackerman MrDestructoid

[0:56:45] <pennykettle_> you can totally farm weapon points as well
[0:56:46] <alexandrecau> Game wants you to play it
[0:56:56] <megamonmon123> you can exploit weapon challenges the same way as well
[0:57:17] <%lewdskeletor13> Yeah that’s how I got some mastery challenges by farming
[0:57:25] <Tucker0603> it's face is tough

[0:57:44] <BlackermanZX> RETRY
[0:57:44] <Invertin> that was CLEARLY the side
[0:57:44] <RichochetForce> Next one is aerial, I think.
[0:57:45] <+YabbaTroll> try a drop down attack
[0:57:46] <megamonmon123> retry
[0:57:48] <%KingVantq> doesnt pinky have a jump kill?
[0:57:51] <RichochetForce> Yes
[0:57:51] <%Irridium> go straight for the backdoor

[0:58:06] <%Javaa01> You got 20 minutes left here
[0:58:10] <Hal10k> Once again, you don't need to beat every challenge to unlock everything
[0:58:10] <WanderingSwordsman> Uno mas
[0:58:10] <RichochetForce> Front, Back, Overhead
[0:58:12] <Monkeyweed21> from above is free
[0:58:16] <+segmentedfool> From above
[0:58:18] <megamonmon123> death from above
[0:58:22] <+segmentedfool> DO AN AERIAL
[0:58:33] <heart_ablaze> you could also do a jump glory kill
[0:58:42] <%lewdskeletor13> Yeah aerial would prob work
[0:59:00] <millermania32> Damn this isn’t DarksydePhil
[0:59:08] <mR_NibZz> freeze first then ssg to the ass
[0:59:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL

[0:59:35] <mR_NibZz> that works too LUL
[0:59:35] <%Javaa01> Shoulda just jumped
[0:59:36] <%Irridium> should've grabbed the longer stun rune LUL
[0:59:38] <megamonmon123> too much hesitation
[0:59:42] <KaiserMario> Dumb! JUST JUMP
[0:59:42] <megamonmon123> aww well
[0:59:42] <@Solidus_113> Just slowly walk towards the demon
[0:59:44] <negrosnake9185> Wow
[0:59:47] <%lewdskeletor13> Hoisted by your own petard
[0:59:51] <%Asuterisuku> Super Gore Nest so good.
[0:59:54] <sniffy77> what are you trying to do? is it something other than a glory kill
[0:59:58] <%Javaa01> JUMPING IS ALWAYS UNIQUE
[1:00:03] <+LokimenD> Should've done like Van Halen told you
[1:00:04] <+YabbaTroll> 3 different glory kills on pinkies
[1:00:04] <megamonmon123> is there another pinky?
[1:00:10] <heart_ablaze> it did in 2016, it does here
[1:00:16] <%Javaa01> Some enemies even have multiple jumping kills
[1:00:19] <%GeneralSCPatton> @sniffy77 Glory kills that he hasn't already done
[1:00:20] <mdkcde> DO AN AERIAL YOU FOOL
[1:00:22] <mR_NibZz> wait your taking 10 goo dmg per hit? that should have gotten reduced in the last patch
[1:00:23] <megamonmon123> fuck it we'll do it live
[1:00:25] <sniffy77> oh
[1:00:29] <%Irridium> I think that was the last one in the level. Maybe there's 1 more. This level's got very few of them
[1:00:31] <BlackermanZX> the result screen ocd tho
[1:00:32] <%Zebroneath> Freeze bomb always helps
[1:00:33] <+EdenOfLove> has woolie done the purple challenge room yet?
[1:00:33] <RichochetForce> @mR_NibZz Is that live on PS4?
[1:00:33] <%Javaa01> Arachnotrons have two different air kills depending on if you come from the front or the back
[1:00:47] <mdkcde> also from the sides
[1:00:52] <mR_NibZz> @RichochetForce its live on pc, i just tested it. maybe not on ps5 ig
[1:01:09] <mR_NibZz> @RichochetForce ps4*
[1:01:12] <RichochetForce> @mR_NibZz Ah, Woolie's on PS4. That may be why it's still like launch
[1:01:17] <RichochetForce> Remember, he plays offline.
[1:01:35] <BlackermanZX> the cookie doodNuts
[1:01:45] <mR_NibZz> yeah you should be taking half the goo dmg right now
[1:01:50] <megamonmon123> Toss your coin to your slayer
[1:01:51] <pennykettle_> are dark souls invasions in yet?
[1:01:53] <RichochetForce> Yes, the toxic damage was part of stuff that was patched.
[1:02:01] <megamonmon123> oh hell of plenty, oh hell of plenty
[1:02:01] <%Javaa01> There are enemies you aren't seeing now because you're playing offline
[1:02:12] <+YabbaTroll> slo mo snek approach
[1:02:13] <%Asuterisuku> Empowered Demons are in now!
[1:02:15] <%KingVantq> was he forced to make a bethesda account while online?
[1:02:29] <RichochetForce> The game nags you
[1:02:35] <RichochetForce> It forces you to make an accoount
[1:02:36] <megamonmon123> @kingvantq he said fuck that
[1:02:38] <%gamewarden92> Toxic was changed to do half damage it's doing now
[1:02:39] <%Javaa01> Toxic damage was normalized
[1:02:44] <+segmentedfool> I can't wait for this levels Slayer gate
[1:02:44] <%Javaa01> But it's still in the game
[1:02:48] <mR_NibZz> @woolieversus the rad suit protects you alot more in the latest patch
[1:02:50] <%Javaa01> Before it scaled up with difficulty
[1:02:55] <%Javaa01> Now it's flat across the board
[1:02:56] <megamonmon123> oh they patched that? cool
[1:03:01] <%Asuterisuku> I never really had trouble with the original toxic damage though.
[1:03:03] <heart_ablaze> @kingvantq ne He's still offline
[1:03:10] <RichochetForce> Yeah, Plasma Rifle's second mod was improved in that patch as well.
[1:03:13] <KaiserMario> But Woolie, id totally took the blame for it, totally not at gunpoint by Bethesda or anything...
[1:03:14] <pennykettle_> dont know how to get this secret
[1:03:18] <%invader_rin> Earlier room
[1:03:25] <megamonmon123> nope
[1:03:29] <StarvingPenguinGod> no
[1:03:53] <%Javaa01> Just get that one on the replay
[1:03:54] <megamonmon123> its a trick
[1:03:57] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:03:59] <megamonmon123> its a very clever secret
[1:03:59] <whazat> when you are in the skyscraper from earlier, you have to jump across, there is a pole
[1:03:59] <+TheBigTaco> @generalve next level
[1:04:03] <ralphfromdk> That one is a "get later"
[1:04:06] <WanderingSwordsman> its fine
[1:04:07] <+the_vedo_show> thats cheap LUL
[1:04:09] <mR_NibZz> just keep jumping it helps lol
[1:04:11] <%dekkitout> Lemmy everywhere system
[1:04:13] <%Asuterisuku> Always be moving, always be JUMPING.
[1:04:13] <%invader_rin> RAD SUIT GONE
[1:04:14] <@Solidus_113> monkaS
[1:04:14] <heart_ablaze> @generalve it's the super gorenest
[1:04:20] <BlackermanZX> @generalve no and thats kinda a spoiler LUL
[1:04:28] <Lordbahamut780> did woolie find daisy on this level yet ?
[1:04:28] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1265145307408539648
[1:04:47] <+DakotaMacDoodle> that just means more gun
[1:04:49] <KaiserMario> Is Woolie still not aiming at weakpoints properly?
[1:04:51] <megamonmon123> he switched grenades! hes learning
[1:04:53] <fruit_pie_the_magician> hobbK hobbK hobbK
[1:04:53] <megamonmon123> awesome
[1:04:58] <%Asuterisuku> They made grenades the way they are in this game so you can keep shooting and still use them.
[1:05:16] <StarvingPenguinGod> previous pinky checkpoint gets the secret
[1:05:21] <ralphfromdk> No, you should have gotten it way earlier in the level, it's now for the rerun
[1:05:21] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus Just skip that secret in the previous area and get it on your own time, it would take too long to backtrack for it
[1:05:29] <cobalt_phoenix_> hi reggie hope you're feeling better
[1:05:34] <%Asuterisuku> Fast Travel soon.
[1:05:34] <%Irridium> remember there is fast travel at the end of the level
[1:05:37] <megamonmon123> just wait till fast travel woolie
[1:05:43] <cobalt_phoenix_> fast travel
[1:05:43] <whazat> you are pretty close to fast travel, but you can also just get it on a replay it is not an amazing secret
[1:05:45] <%invader_rin> Fast travel
[1:05:50] <@Solidus_113> Do you have a token to spend on extra rad protection?
[1:05:50] <RunningNGunning> Have to back to the super mario area
[1:06:01] <alexandrecau> chainsaw tentacle for bullets
[1:06:02] <@Solidus_113> you have 5
[1:06:09] <WanderingSwordsman> @woolieversus just play the game and get it off camera or when you get fast travel
[1:06:12] <%lewdskeletor13> Yeah I had to replay the level for that one
[1:06:17] <%Solidnick18> daisy
[1:06:19] <%dekkitout> GivePLZ
[1:06:22] <+YabbaTroll> wondering about my loved ones
[1:06:28] <%Irridium> Wondering about my Loved Ones
[1:06:30] <+YabbaTroll> from wolfenstein 3d
[1:06:31] <%lewdskeletor13> Daisy
[1:06:32] <RunningNGunning> It was an album
[1:06:33] <%Javaa01> Yeah, that was a Wolf3D track, you can't check it from the pause menu
[1:06:33] <%Asuterisuku> "Wondering About My Loved Ones," from Wolfenstein 3D.
[1:06:37] <%lewdskeletor13> brownHANDS
[1:07:00] <@Solidus_113> get dash cooldown and rad protection
[1:07:02] <%Javaa01> Spend one point on environment protection and get dash recharge speed
[1:07:04] <megamonmon123> thats great
[1:07:06] <BlackermanZX> Dash cooldown
[1:07:14] <sniffy77> dash cooldown if you havent gotten it yet
[1:07:17] <megamonmon123> dash cooldown is also nice
[1:07:18] <Lordbahamut780> oh i meant the hidden daisy thats in every level
[1:07:21] <sniffy77> then 2 grenades
[1:07:33] <KaiserMario> Props for Reggie saying "wolfenstein" correctly
[1:07:39] <BlackermanZX> dash refill quickly is super important for mobility
[1:07:55] <RichochetForce> @KaiserMario We should got ask Alex "Wolfenstein" Battaglia
[1:07:58] <RichochetForce> if he said it correctly.
[1:08:14] <KaiserMario> LUL
[1:08:18] <megamonmon123> dash cooldown
[1:08:35] <@Solidus_113> punch something
[1:08:37] <%Asuterisuku> He still hasn't gotten that cookie.
[1:09:02] <megamonmon123> he'll get em in clean up
[1:09:06] <%lewdskeletor13> Don’t forget you’ll get fast travel
[1:09:08] <RichochetForce> Sugar Cookie Getter
[1:09:12] <%Irridium> you should go into that big blood spire in the middle
[1:09:14] <cobalt_phoenix_> once you get cooldown on grenades and the rune that reduces cooldown on gear, your flame belch and grenades are almost always ready when done right. it's the best
[1:09:17] <KaiserMario> Isn't Reggie short for Regina?
[1:09:22] <%lewdskeletor13> Yes
[1:09:31] <%lewdskeletor13> That’s canon now
[1:09:34] <megamonmon123> lol
[1:09:34] <%Solidnick18> woop woop
[1:09:37] <%Asuterisuku> The key to opening that is the extra life on the pedestal you got earlier.
[1:09:37] <BlackermanZX> emotional damage
[1:09:39] <%dekkitout> It be like that
[1:09:42] <Monkeyweed21> middle tower is open
[1:09:44] <%Javaa01> You can go to the blue key icon on the spire, you have the blue key
[1:09:49] <ralphfromdk> You have the blue key, you can go in the middle tower thing now
[1:09:53] <pennykettle_> reggie is actually short for Cool Reggie
[1:09:55] <megamonmon123> ah he missed another rune
[1:09:57] <+The_Lunar_Paladin> Just wait for fast travel woolie
[1:10:00] <WanderingSwordsman> @woolieversus you did all the waves, all that is left is the slayer gate and killing the nest
[1:10:02] <+segmentedfool> Go to the blue tower
[1:10:07] <megamonmon123> remember fast travel woolie
[1:10:08] <+TheBigTaco> The game mocks you LUL
[1:10:14] <%lewdskeletor13> Oh god I forgot about the slayer gate
[1:10:20] <@Solidus_113> I'd say leave the gate for off screen
[1:10:21] <%dekkitout> It's to make you feel like a Dread Knight "Every moment you aren't viciously murdering is pain"
[1:10:26] <%Asuterisuku> This is not where you need to go.
[1:10:30] <@Solidus_113> focus on progressing to the next level
[1:10:32] <%Javaa01> And now Woolie is well and truly lost
[1:10:45] <whazat> we are in the woolie hole now
[1:10:53] <%Javaa01> Nope
[1:10:57] <%Asuterisuku> Nope, Woolie.
[1:10:59] <megamonmon123> you can still.get it
[1:10:59] <cobalt_phoenix_> no
[1:11:00] <BlackermanZX> no
[1:11:03] <%Javaa01> That's not how you get to it
[1:11:03] <+TheBigTaco> Finally...the woolie hole...
[1:11:18] <RichochetForce> Yeah, all the secrets can be grabbed the first time through.
[1:11:23] <+TheSaintJohn> forward then back around to get to that one
[1:11:34] <%invader_rin> Especially when you can teleport back at the end of t he level.
[1:11:35] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:11:37] <%Javaa01> Yes it is
[1:11:40] <Monkeyweed21> yes
[1:11:41] <%Javaa01> Reggie saw right
[1:11:41] <cobalt_phoenix_> try to make progress like when you first got the yellow key
[1:11:45] <RichochetForce> @invader_rin Exactly.
[1:11:46] <$realm_forge> I love/hate when games tease you with visible power ups
[1:11:47] <%Asuterisuku> This isn't like 2016, you can't lock yourself out of secrets.
[1:12:20] <pennykettle_> I feel like some levels can lock you out of things with fast travel
[1:12:21] <KaiserMario> Reggie saw the hole good
[1:12:23] <$realm_forge> Hey look it’s the basement beneath every Arby’s location
[1:12:23] <%Javaa01> There is a hole in the floor there
[1:12:28] <StarvingPenguinGod> you jump down into that room
[1:12:28] <cobalt_phoenix_> it's back in the main room you teleport here from
[1:12:31] <%Asuterisuku> "I'm trying to figure out what's on the floor."
[1:12:33] <RichochetForce> Yes
[1:12:39] <%Asuterisuku> Where there's no floor.
[1:12:55] <whazat> there is a hole in the floor which connects to a hallway elsewhere in the level
[1:12:56] <RichochetForce> Reggie has the right idea
[1:13:04] <cobalt_phoenix_> it's not from this room
[1:13:11] <megamonmon123> not in this room
[1:13:12] <grimshuck> Its in the mall area
[1:13:18] <%Javaa01> Well, there's a path on a lower level right next to it
[1:13:20] <cobalt_phoenix_> right
[1:13:24] <%Javaa01> So walk there and look up
[1:13:28] <peachy996> Sweet you're still on Super Gore Nest
[1:13:38] <peachy996> I love this level I love the music
[1:13:42] <%Asuterisuku> Remember to check your corners, Woolie.
[1:13:50] <megamonmon123> so now the rest is gravy
[1:13:53] <+The_Lunar_Paladin> Best rune right there
[1:13:56] <brianthe12th> iirc the slayer gate here has more pinkies to kill
[1:14:02] <swushandsuch> kill VoHiYo
[1:14:02] <%Javaa01> DI is more useful later
[1:14:16] <%Javaa01> Where you're expected to do longer and more accurate jumps
[1:14:16] <Monkeyweed21> Remember you can open blue key doors now
[1:14:18] <+TheBigTaco> @peachy996 well unfortunately there are no more encounters that will play the music lol
[1:14:22] <@Solidus_113> DI also affects the meathook
[1:14:25] <TheAmazingClaytor> Oh hey I finally get to catch this live! How's it going chat?
[1:14:38] <RichochetForce> It's going well, Claytor.
[1:14:42] <$realm_forge> Blood punch health is the best!
[1:14:45] <RichochetForce> Reggie has proposed to Karen
[1:14:51] <RichochetForce> Woolie loves the turret
[1:14:56] <RichochetForce> All is good.
[1:14:58] <%Asuterisuku> I personally prefer the faster equipment recharge.
[1:15:00] <RunningNGunning> Look at this goddamn map
[1:15:04] <$realm_forge> It’s like a free, much faster glory kill
[1:15:05] <%Javaa01> I mean, it's a pink ball, close enough
[1:15:13] <%LanceCorpralScottBukake> LanceCorpralScottBukake subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! 2020 is a thick dick hitting us in the face we didn’t see coming until the testicles were hitting our chin so hard that it knocked out a couple of teeth. Holy shit thank uranus for this content
[1:15:22] <TheAmazingClaytor> @RichochetForce Thanks for the recap :)
[1:15:26] <JetpackMcQuack> Everybody’s favourite little pink ball
[1:15:27] <BlackermanZX> DI + faster dash cooldown helps a lot in later fights
[1:15:33] <+YabbaTroll> @LanceCorpralScottBukake Amen
[1:15:39] <cobalt_phoenix_> @LanceCorpralScottBukake yes
[1:15:39] <Monkeyweed21> the tower in the courtyard is open now
[1:15:41] <%lewdskeletor13> Hello Gordon
[1:15:46] <%Javaa01> Yes
[1:15:47] <%Irridium> you should check that big meat tower in the beggining arena
[1:15:47] <RichochetForce> Yes
[1:15:49] <megamonmon123> yep
[1:15:53] <RichochetForce> Free ammo, good shit
[1:15:55] <%Asuterisuku> That is exactly what it means.
[1:15:57] <$realm_forge> Kirby and Doomslayer doing the Goku Vageeta fist bump
[1:16:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> PUNCH BARRELS FOR AMMO, TWICE
[1:16:09] <%lewdskeletor13> This level has a lot going on
[1:16:16] <Arrowheart17> Blue key opens teeth thing
[1:16:16] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:16:19] <%Javaa01> That is correct, but since barrels only respawn once, you can't farm barrels for ammo infinitely
[1:16:21] <%lewdskeletor13> Yes
[1:16:23] <megamonmon123> check the centre gore thing
[1:16:26] <astonishingthatguy> blue key
[1:16:28] <%DesertPenguin> lol
[1:16:31] <grimshuck> You got the blue key Woolie
[1:16:34] <Monkeyweed21> you have the blue key
[1:16:35] <%Javaa01> Go look at that blue teeth door
[1:16:37] <ralphfromdk> You have the blue key, go in that middle tower
[1:16:37] <%emperordread> Woolie "Unless ..." Madden woolieSHOOK
[1:16:39] <negrosnake9185> The gore tower
[1:16:46] <TheAmazingClaytor> "Okay. Sending twitch stream to "Mom" in your contacts."
[1:16:46] <$realm_forge> Siri list Woolies internet search history!
[1:16:48] <mR_NibZz> LUL
[1:16:49] <%Asuterisuku> You can open the big pillar.
[1:16:52] <+elclintonio> blue key on the tower in the middle of the room
[1:16:55] <@Solidus_113> you have all the keys
[1:16:58] <kei_ar_> ddid the stream just repet
[1:17:00] <cobalt_phoenix_> tooth tower
[1:17:02] <+YabbaTroll> heat the key

[1:17:05] <%lewdskeletor13> What if Siri started yelling at you like your mom
[1:17:10] <@Solidus_113> 3rd loop now
[1:17:13] <megamonmon123> check the centre gore thing with the blue on it
[1:17:14] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Thats.....VERY SPECIFIC Reggie LUL
[1:17:26] <%lewdskeletor13> Reggie that’s super specific
[1:17:34] <cobalt_phoenix_> so like do these flesh constructs grow on their own or did the demons build them?
[1:17:36] <$realm_forge> Look for blue then smash
[1:17:45] <%Asuterisuku> @CobaltPhoenix27 Yes.
[1:17:48] <RichochetForce> Look for Becky then smash
[1:17:48] <pennykettle_> @CobaltPhoenix27 the lore entry specifically says "we dont fucking know"
[1:17:59] <+YabbaTroll> i think theres a pinky ahead
[1:18:00] <%Javaa01> Yeah, go forward to get the good stuff
[1:18:02] <cobalt_phoenix_> ah I see clear as gore
[1:18:04] <+YabbaTroll> the last one
[1:18:16] <TheAmazingClaytor> "Shit's fucked, dunno how....Uh oh."
[1:18:18] <StarvingPenguinGod> PepeLaugh pinky
[1:18:25] <%Asuterisuku> UAC would be my favourite if it had unique colours for different elements.
[1:18:31] <pennykettle_> This is the UI color I played with. It turns out some colors are worse than others
[1:18:37] <@Solidus_113> Sentinel Armour is probably what you're looking for
[1:18:37] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:18:39] <%Javaa01> If you're looking for Weapon Wheel customization, that's in the weapon list
[1:18:39] <RichochetForce> UAC is my favorite. Nice and clean
[1:18:40] <@Solidus_113> that's the easy mode
[1:18:49] <RichochetForce> Easy to read, and the red is a crisp highlight color
[1:18:54] <megamonmon123> video
[1:18:57] <megamonmon123> probably
[1:19:06] <@Solidus_113> Fisheye boys
[1:19:10] <+CryptusMaximus> I keep FOV around 105-ish
[1:19:13] <%gamewarden92> become quake pro
[1:19:15] <%lewdskeletor13> There’s also a pretty nice photo mode
[1:19:17] <ralphfromdk> It's not the biggest jump
[1:19:18] <pennykettle_> oh lord
[1:19:20] <%Asuterisuku> 100-105 would probably be a bit better.
[1:19:22] <%Irridium> FishEyeGuy
[1:19:23] <cobalt_phoenix_> idk why i picked amber from the getgo, then later switched to default and realized that the default had different colors for guns based on the ammo, then wondered why every color scheme didn't do that
[1:19:23] <%Th3SmartAlec> My eyeeeeees
[1:19:24] <megamonmon123> this looks weird but okay
[1:19:24] <%Solidnick18> oh god

[1:19:30] <peachy996> That's how I played Doom 2016 last year
[1:19:31] <%Asuterisuku> Spectres are not Pinkies.
[1:19:32] <%Javaa01> Don't worry about it
[1:19:33] <%invader_rin> TOO STRONG
[1:19:34] <RichochetForce> Specters die so fast

[1:20:03] <%Irridium> you can't glory kill spectres
[1:20:03] <+CryptusMaximus> I'd knock the FOV to about 100-105. It's too fisheye at 110 or above

[1:20:51] <cobalt_phoenix_> is there no pinky in the gate?
[1:20:52] <%Zebroneath> This is one of the more annoying challeges, tbh
[1:20:56] <%Irridium> this is fine
[1:20:57] <%Javaa01> You have all the collectables, so just go to the progress

[1:22:29] <@Solidus_113> yeah it was ice

[1:31:24] <grimshuck> You have fast travel
[1:31:25] <mdkcde> And to think there's people that miss the keys because they ran out of the room too fast
[1:31:25] <megamonmon123> fast travel
[1:31:26] <peachy996> (Reggie don't read this) does anyone know about the balloons hidden encounter?

[1:49:34] <megamonmon123> @chrisplaysthing sorry for your loss man, hope this stream and being here helps
[1:49:43] <MayorRev> @WoolieVersus you equip skins on the main menu FYI
[1:49:51] <%dekkitout> I just wanna see Doomguy and Vega drift in the Doomzord
[1:50:10] <%Javaa01> Every enemy type shows up here eventually
[1:50:18] <%Asuterisuku> It's the best on Nightmare.
[1:50:20] <%FuqBoiSlim> Yeah I dont really listen to screamo or numetal or whatever but this song is banging dood Kappa
[1:50:30] <%GeneralSCPatton> @lewdskeletor13 DoomRL makes some armors out of Plasteel, but I don't know if that's drawn from the greater canon or from other sources.
[1:50:35] <%Asuterisuku> That isn't screamo OR nu metal.
[1:50:36] <%lewdskeletor13> I wanna believe that Doomguy named this the Ripatorium himself
[1:50:53] <pennykettle_> you dont have to fire all the missiles at once. just hold alt fire to open up the missile launcher and fire at will
[1:51:04] <%xeromage> xeromage subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! Just popped in to re-up the prime sub. Love you guys!

[1:51:37] <%lewdskeletor13> Dying here won’t eat up your lives btw
[1:51:53] <%KingVantq> dont think ive touched the training room more than twice
[1:51:55] <%Asuterisuku> Don't think of armour as separate from health. Burn everything.
[1:52:00] <%wolfofsound> @pennykettle_ it's like dying on the toilet
[1:52:03] <%Irridium> gotta control the shots

[1:52:44] <%Irridium> also it doesn't have to be continuous fire. just 3 from the same clip. so you can shoot one, run, shoot another, run, shoot another, and get it
[1:52:50] <%Asuterisuku> Carcasses are annoyance incarnate.
[1:52:59] <%Asuterisuku> They exist to keep players from strafing too much.

[1:57:55] <%NeroInfinite> There's a collection of people safe and fighting hordes.
[1:57:57] <alexandrecau> IT's funny because she slips saying challenged likely because the uac propaganda hit hard

[1:58:16] <+evbites> He cool but let him work
[1:58:18] <%Javaa01> You get way more cookies then you need during the campaign
[1:58:20] <pennykettle_> THAT WOULD BE TERRIBLE LUL
[1:58:20] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Demons are afraid of the funnel webs
[1:58:20] <MayorRev> Woolie apparently the lack of offline skin changes is a bug and bethesda has said they'll fix in a future patch. others have said it pops up eventually the more you progress.

[2:01:34] <%SuperKirby24> doomicorn?
[2:01:35] <whazat> Bethesda just doing Bethesda things
[2:01:36] <brachydios777> Wait, I can use my skins offline, the hell?
[2:01:37] <+CryptusMaximus> Hitman 2016 and Hitman 2 did the same shit. Single Player unlocks that you only got while connected
[2:01:38] <%FuqBoiSlim> @superkirby24 2016 suit
[2:01:40] <%DesertPenguin> What's the harm in signing in though?
[2:01:42] <@Solidus_113> It seems to be a common bug on Doom Subreddit threads
[2:01:45] <RichochetForce> Bethesda is Mendoza's sister.
[2:01:47] <%Th3SmartAlec> @SuperKirby24 He unlocked the 2016 skin but the game won't let him equip it
[2:01:47] <%SuperKirby24> ah, ok
[2:01:49] <%Asuterisuku> Remember: Don't blame Todd for Pete's decisions.
[2:01:50] <NicholasOsen_> I can use skins offline
[2:01:53] <%lewdskeletor13> It’s a bug apparently?
[2:01:55] <sniffy77> excited to hear this on the podcast on monday
[2:01:59] <+dmtjinni> LUL
[2:02:00] <$legacy0117> Wait really??
[2:02:00] <%NeroInfinite> @WoolieVersus You might just have to let the rewards screem load at the end of a mission.
[2:02:02] <WanderingSwordsman> @woolieversus take your anger out on Samuel
[2:02:05] <+evbites> WHAT HAPPENED YOU USED TO BE COOL
[2:02:05] <+404cp> just let the rewards screen load
[2:02:10] <bevyrage> @sniffy77 podcast on tuesday
[2:02:14] <+404cp> its not online o ly
[2:02:15] <%Javaa01> @Asuterisuku Just blame Todd for his own numerous mistakes instead
[2:02:16] <cobalt_phoenix_> now funnel that rage towards the demons
[2:02:16] <Aleate> I'm pretty sure it reset your unlock because you logged out of the game and back in, but when you went back in, in that game you didn't unlock it again before starting the mission @woolieversus same thing happened to me
[2:02:18] <%DesertPenguin> You're not wrong but god damn get over it, it's harmless lol
[2:02:20] <RichochetForce> @Asuterisuku Sir, Pete is the Baron of Hell to Todd's Spider Mastermind.

[2:24:38] <%DesertPenguin> wha happun?
[2:24:40] <pennykettle_> Did he accidentally do the speedun tech?
[2:24:41] <DeathByPoke7> speeeeeeeeeeeeed
[2:24:45] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus That's called a sloppy boost, speedrunners have been using that physics abuse since launch week
[2:24:47] <%Asuterisuku> The way it works is multiple jump inputs off a sloped surface.
[2:24:51] <%lewdskeletor13> Sequence break the game
[2:24:55] <+BubbaRands> RECREATE IT
[2:24:57] <%Th3SmartAlec> PLEASE DO
[2:25:00] <$legacy0117> SLOW MO SUPER JUMP
[2:25:11] <Louie_Salmon> Oh shit he did a slope jump?
[2:25:17] <+evbites> BIG qa
[2:25:18] <Ozmodyas> can you angel it so you hit the boost as you fly in from the chain
[2:25:24] <+arancet> tester instincts kicked in
[2:25:28] <%Asuterisuku> It works best on high frame rates.
[2:25:30] <MayorRev> I believe you did something called "trimping"
[2:25:32] <a_mad_dragon> bullet time bouncing
[2:25:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> MULTIPLE JUMPS OFF SLOPE DURING SLO MO
[2:25:40] <%Josef_Stryker> It was a one in a million glitch

[2:27:27] <%Javaa01> Can't shoot the canons off these ones
[2:27:31] <%DesertPenguin> Don't be fooled, going in close makes them do an AoE

[2:28:03] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus remember to read the Prowler codex too, it was missed

[2:28:20] <Bodregg> @WoolieVersus if you go close they will zone with AoEs, consider staggering before you go in or dashing to get in faster

[2:32:55] <$legacy0117> GUN DEVIL GAEMS
[2:32:56] <cobalt_phoenix_> i never understood what falter is, is it just stun? or does it improve the chance of staggering for glory kill?
[2:32:57] <+DakotaMacDoodle> Mick also did PREY (2017) soundtrack comparing the two you really see his range and mastery over his craft.
[2:33:04] <valriot> Oh this Slayer gate LUL LUL
[2:33:10] <RichochetForce> @CobaltPhoenix27 They falter, they trip and stumble
[2:33:12] <CrypticMochi> Since everything likes to take prick shot at you, shield good
[2:33:14] <%lewdskeletor13> Prey was great
[2:33:15] <%Asuterisuku> Killer Instinct, too, and both of Machine's Wolfenstein games.
[2:33:19] <%invader_rin> Then you have the visual on the gun itself, so good
[2:33:19] <brianthe12th> this next slayer gate is probably the best one
[2:33:27] <Bodregg> @CobaltPhoenix27 it's stagger, very important for approaching mancs and stuff
[2:33:31] <%SuperKirby24> which gate is this? 6th?
[2:33:33] <TheAmazingClaytor> punch it
[2:33:36] <brianthe12th> The 4th

[2:43:44] <@Menitta> HELL GODS
[2:43:44] <TheAmazingClaytor> God bacjkwards, Dogs
[2:43:45] <%GeneralSCPatton> Tower of Babel is the level where you fought the first Cyberdemon in Doom 1
[2:43:47] <peachy996> Is there God?
[2:43:49] <%Irridium> and then ELDER Hell Gods
[2:43:49] <OkamiDude15> I MUST CONSULT THE HELLDER GODS
[2:43:50] <+LokimenD> Yeah, they're called John Carmack and John Romero
[2:43:52] <%SuperKirby24> DAHLINGTON
[2:43:55] <@Menitta> BIGGER HELL GODS
[2:43:55] <liriallirial> THAT'S IRONY ON IT'S FINEST FORM
[2:43:56] <%kapcommunist> Beyblades3- tower of beybel-lades
[2:43:58] <librettodude> God, Elder God, Hell Gods, Elder Hell Gods, implying Junior Executive Hell Gods
[2:43:58] <%lewdskeletor13> Ok maybe they just call themselves gods
[2:44:03] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @santafer
[2:44:05] <AkumaFalcon93> Sounds like Gnosticism
[2:44:07] <%vaderxyz1970> Can't wait for the NOOOOO
[2:44:13] <%DesertPenguin> But wait! There's more!
[2:44:13] <ZeeR01> Helder Gods you might say? LUL
[2:44:18] <RichochetForce> Hell Elder God-in-Residence
[2:44:19] <+Cavumentum> I mean there were already Barons and Knights, where are my HELL KINGS
[2:44:22] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[2:44:23] <%emperordread> Ah, Horatio, of course
[2:44:33] <ralphfromdk> Don't worry, this doesn't come up at all, it's just background fluff
[2:44:36] <%Javaa01> The God Hype Beasts Of Hell From The Fifth Order
[2:44:36] <RichochetForce> Yeah, the demons have a clear hierarchy
[2:44:43] <+CryptusMaximus> Imagine if the Icon of Sin was just a Hell-God
[2:44:47] <RichochetForce> Hell Knights impose the hierarchy on other demons
[2:44:48] <+evbites> SHOOT IT TILL IT DIES
[2:44:53] <neilgilbertg97> chaos gods?
[2:44:53] <cobalt_phoenix_> prowler codex tho
[2:44:56] <RichochetForce> Barons have their own fiefdom
[2:44:57] <$legacy0117> THERE ARE NINE CIRCLES FRIEND. DOOMGUY has been playing around on THE FIRST CIRCLE ALL THIS TIME.
[2:44:59] <%dekkitout> The Seven Council of Nine also from Doom 2016
[2:44:59] <%lewdskeletor13> I’m assuming the Dark One they mention in the first game is an Elder Hell God
[2:44:59] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @cryptusmaximus Kinda actually
[2:45:01] <alexandrecau> Icon is not even a god, just a titan
[2:45:01] <librettodude> if it's a hierarchy in hell, why is it not called a loerarchy? 🤔
[2:45:04] <RichochetForce> Hell Priests got the religion shit
[2:45:06] <BlackermanZX> he will never read the prowler codex
[2:45:13] <RichochetForce> It makes sense they have Hell Elder Gods
[2:45:15] <cobalt_phoenix_> rip prowler
[2:45:16] <umbrellaswereawesome> Prowler and SSG will forever be the "lost codexes".
[2:45:29] <%ChoculaUltra> did Woolie tweak the fov or something? stepped away for a bit
[2:45:33] <RahuHordika> SSG is the best weapon entry too, that’s so painful
[2:45:39] <peachy996> He did tweak yes
[2:45:42] <goobee721> i thought their mics were some dope ass masks for a second lol xD
[2:45:42] <RichochetForce> @ChoculaUltra FOV is maxed
[2:45:42] <%Javaa01> Oh yeah, those codexes ain't never getting read at this point
[2:45:44] <RogueMinja> Gotta fill out that map.
[2:45:45] <+evbites> Prowler imps but they teleport
[2:45:46] <RichochetForce> We are fisheye.
[2:45:47] <%NeroInfinite> Codex for SSG and prwler never read.
[2:45:51] <%ChoculaUltra> ah I seeeee
[2:45:54] <%ChoculaUltra> everything
[2:46:04] <+LokimenD> we quake now
[2:46:08] <%DesertPenguin> The plasma blast is so good
[2:46:10] <TheAmazingClaytor> KABLAMZOS
[2:46:10] <%lewdskeletor13> In Biblical stuff demons were sometimes worshipped as gods do it could be a case of them just calling themselves gods
[2:46:12] <peachy996> Which track is this?
[2:46:13] <RichochetForce> @ChoculaUltra To play Quake you must BECOME Quake.
[2:46:27] <%gamewarden92> Aquakening
[2:46:30] <%FuqBoiSlim> Arc complex
[2:46:31] <%lewdskeletor13> This game has a few Quake references
[2:46:31] <+CryptusMaximus> Doom 3 is gonna just be Hell God of War with you dismantling the entire hierarchy of hell all the way down to Satan
[2:46:34] <%GeneralSCPatton> Read Prowler and Super Shotty Codex

[2:49:37] <Ner234> PARCHED
[2:49:39] <ralphfromdk> Oh it only gets worse from here on out :D
[2:49:40] <vulkans2> dr coomer richardson
[2:49:44] <+BubbaRands> DoomGuy: looks like you need a drink
[2:49:44] <SlammerMchammer> it. gets. better
[2:49:45] <OutOftouch_> THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING
[2:49:46] <%lewdskeletor13> It’s super sensual
[2:49:53] <raikagelord1> Shaken her “Scientific resolve”
[2:49:55] <%ChoculaUltra> imagine being a scientist and a fucking robot with a vial of hell juice shows up and changes the whole game
[2:49:56] <BlackermanZX> i think this was the second audio log?
[2:49:56] <+Buzzkill983> its not the only thing shaken
[2:49:56] <Monkeyweed21> HUGE BALLS
[2:50:00] <%Irridium> what
[2:50:06] <RichochetForce> In 2016 it flat out says Doom Guy was enhanced
[2:50:07] <xbb1024> jumping pad
[2:50:15] <RichochetForce> It was in one of the codex entries
[2:50:15] <DFireCreations> divine balls
[2:50:16] <%invader_rin> lol, skip that pad
[2:50:16] <SlammerMchammer> I mean
[2:50:18] <SlammerMchammer> ok
[2:50:19] <%Irridium> well fuck the jumping pad I guess
[2:50:20] <megamonmon123> he did it wrong but it worked out
[2:50:21] <primarch_lupercal> oh wait its asajj ventress voicing her? neat
[2:50:22] <%lewdskeletor13> The Seraphim blessed you, they talked about it in 2016
[2:50:22] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:50:26] <%Asuterisuku> It sucks through ammo.
[2:50:35] <Daxalog> You want to use it to finish off big dudes as a room clear
[2:50:37] <%ChoculaUltra> Samus vibes
[2:50:42] <RichochetForce> @primarch_lupercal Yup, Nika is using her Asajj voice just slightly modified
[2:50:48] <bearalin> Pop
[2:50:49] <%GeneralSCPatton> The Seraphim saw that he was hype and said "YO CAN I HOOK YOU UP WITH A BLESSING?"
[2:50:55] <%BallerSwagBro9k> nope
[2:50:55] <umbrellaswereawesome> Apparently, if you beam a heavy, it'll remain briefly stunlocked even if you stop beaming it.
[2:50:58] <+doc_ock_rokc> use it on enemies who have taken damage and it eats less ammo
[2:50:59] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus You trade increased ammo consumption for a free stunlock for as long as you have ammo left
[2:51:00] <%lewdskeletor13> Nika was also Catwoman I’m Brave and the Bold
[2:51:03] <RichochetForce> @lewdskeletor13 Yes! That was the name given to the one that enhanced Doomguy
[2:51:09] <cobalt_phoenix_> basically used right when a big guy is close to death so it makes a big boom
[2:51:20] <+TheBigTaco> @generalscpatton LMAOOO
[2:51:23] <%gamewarden92> "Get in the power coffin before my boss comes back in!"
[2:51:23] <Monkeyweed21> you can upgrade the turret
[2:51:31] <$realm_forge> Nooooo heat blast is so much better
[2:51:32] <+evbites> The Seraphim: Have some goo my doom dude
[2:51:50] <umbrellaswereawesome> That said, I think the beam is best left for someone who's good at quick switching.
[2:52:13] <cobalt_phoenix_> you can stop firing and it will still count, just as long as you don't undeploy the turret
[2:52:13] <%lewdskeletor13> It took me too long to realize how good heat blast was in my first playthrough
[2:52:13] <OldOnyx> 2016 mentions the doomslayer is enhanced but mostly just describes him as a pure ball of anger.
[2:52:24] <+CryptusMaximus> Woolie, it's worth noting you DON'T have to sustain fire. You can cherry tap it. Just don't let it over heat and don't let it cool completely
[2:52:26] <Bodregg> just camera
[2:52:27] <megamonmon123> youll get there later
[2:52:29] <@Solidus_113> just camera
[2:52:30] <OldOnyx> this game wont shut up with "chosen one" stuff
[2:52:31] <$razielhex> This is one of my favorite levels in the game. For sure.
[2:52:31] <megamonmon123> just camera
[2:52:34] <%Javaa01> Just keep going forward
[2:52:37] <%Javaa01> You'll get there
[2:52:37] <RogueMinja> Da plane.
[2:52:43] <Monkeyweed21> its progress
[2:52:48] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[2:52:56] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> YEYEYE

[2:53:15] <%Asuterisuku> Secret nearby.
[2:53:17] <$BrazenMask> this ones kind of a pain
[2:53:20] <@Solidus_113> the whiff
[2:53:30] <Bodregg> music is gone
[2:53:33] <+RyanTheRecluse> heatblast is godly, especially against the doom hunter and tyrant
[2:53:37] <+green715> You can stop firing, as long as the turrets stay deployed and don't overheat you're good
[2:53:41] <%Asuterisuku> The music's still there, it's just quiet.
[2:53:46] <megamonmon123> woolie didnt you want to change your runes @woolieversus
[2:54:02] <%Javaa01> Crystal in this room
[2:54:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> Flame Hook ia the greatest

[2:54:20] <%lewdskeletor13> Woolie has really gotten the flow down
[2:54:28] <%FuqBoiSlim> The music only gets turned up when you have an S rank Kappa
[2:54:33] <MasterTonberry23> Stay on your toes gentlemen, we havent even yet seen the worst this level has to offer
[2:54:40] <%lewdskeletor13> Have they found any lore in this level yet besides the audio
[2:54:50] <$razielhex> @MasterTonberry23 The worst is the last minute.
[2:54:52] <@Menitta> It seems all my complaints with this game were only in the early game
[2:55:06] <@Menitta> I need to pick it back up
[2:55:37] <MasterTonberry23> Prepare for titanfall
[2:55:38] <$razielhex> Man but I love this level
[2:55:39] <+YabbaTroll> yo sam was planning shit
[2:55:43] <%dekkitout> Too late
[2:55:49] <%Josef_Stryker> Too late
[2:55:50] <%GeneralSCPatton> We're cancelling Armageddon!
[2:55:52] <Bodregg> woolie out here getting mechbaited
[2:55:53] <%gamewarden92> What if there was a Mechwarrior: Doom Edition spin off?

[2:56:01] <+RyanTheRecluse> has woolie read the super shotty codex yet?
[2:56:02] <RunningNGunning> They are tickling your ass with a Mech shaped feather Woolie
[2:56:02] <%lewdskeletor13> Sam created the mechas Woolie, was it worth it
[2:56:03] <RichochetForce> Woolie desires his Legion
[2:56:08] <%Asuterisuku> A whole other game's worth of stuff happened between 2016 and Eternal.
[2:56:08] <+YabbaTroll> now that was just rude
[2:56:10] <KnivesEve> you will e mech baited
[2:56:17] <umbrellaswereawesome> @RyanTheRecluse He probably never will at this point.
[2:56:22] <$legacy0117> THIS GAME MECH BAITS SO MUCH.
[2:56:25] <MasterTonberry23> Well now the problem is supersolved
[2:56:31] <@Solidus_113> ammo though
[2:56:33] <%dekkitout> When level 3 has a scenic vista of a Doom-zord striking down a Giga-demon, it's been way too late
[2:56:38] <%Asuterisuku> More crystals!
[2:56:46] <@Solidus_113> 3 you can get ice grendae
[2:56:48] <@Solidus_113> grenade
[2:56:51] <KaiserMario> Nothing else on that floor?
[2:56:53] <$razielhex> Hahahaha you are baited into thinking tha SLAYERMECH in the fortress will play a role in the base game and it never does
[2:56:59] <$razielhex> maybe in an expansion

[2:58:16] <RichochetForce> This part was confusing
[2:58:20] <%Javaa01> Box behind you, punch it
[2:58:20] <%DesertPenguin> Yea it's not easy to find
[2:58:23] <%Asuterisuku> Look behind you.
[2:58:26] <%DesertPenguin> C'mon Javaa

[2:58:28] <$razielhex> that's a goddamned jump pussy
[2:58:31] <Louie_Salmon> Oh yeah I remember this room being confusing
[2:58:32] <%lewdskeletor13> I’m replaying 2016 right now and it’s so annoying how you die instantly when you fall. Glad they fixed that in this game
[2:58:32] <@Solidus_113> the green
[2:58:33] <RichochetForce> This could've been done better
[2:58:36] <@Solidus_113> green is good
[2:58:38] <SlammerMchammer> green
[2:58:41] <BlackermanZX> oh this thing LUL
[2:58:45] <%SuperKirby24> yeah this part was kinda confusing ngl
[2:58:47] <+TheBigTaco> To be fair, I was also blind to the box
[2:58:48] <SlammerMchammer> bro-
[2:58:48] <ralphfromdk> You just came from there Woolie :D
[2:58:54] <RichochetForce> I hated this because of how poorly it was displayed to the player
[2:58:56] <+segmentedfool> The box is hard to see
[2:58:57] <%Asuterisuku> "Slobberknocker." I like that word.
[2:58:58] <ralphfromdk> Stand on the borked vending machine
[2:59:00] <RichochetForce> You land and have your back turned to the box
[2:59:01] <%GeneralSCPatton> You can punch the box?
[2:59:02] <%invader_rin> It's a possible jump
[2:59:06] <DXLelouch24> this is your first gitgud platforming section
[2:59:07] <%DesertPenguin> I didn't think you could get behind it, that was the issue
[2:59:08] <$razielhex> he has to punch the box
[2:59:08] <alexandrecau> In this game it would have been cruel if fall kills you
[2:59:09] <DXLelouch24> enjoy
[2:59:10] <%lewdskeletor13> Hmmmm
[2:59:11] <peachy996> look for green around you
[2:59:20] <RichochetForce> @DesertPenguin Exactly, you can't get behind most things in the game.

[3:37:54] <$legacy0117> Not effective on Pinkies
[3:37:56] <+slayabee> You have to use that mod at low health
[3:37:57] <librettodude> more for CC than damage
[3:38:00] <%RueOrin> The heat mod is so much better it's silly
[3:38:02] <@Solidus_113> what a flaccid end to one of the best combat rooms
[3:38:04] <%Zebroneath> Microwave's only really good on enemies that are almost dead, for the explosion.
[3:38:05] <RichochetForce> @librettodude Correct
[3:38:07] <MKII> a technique that would require a mouse
[3:38:07] <%GeneralSCPatton> The trick with microwave is to finish them off after wounding them with other things.

[3:38:12] <%NecDW4> @WoolieVersus that ghost buster beam really is better used for shields, it tears through them a bit faster than regular shots. Does wonders on the doom hunter.

[4:04:17] <Nilbanas> Woolie will kill it in one try :D
[4:04:18] <$legacy0117> Yeah, the Ice/slow element is for cautionary babies, except when Doomguy uses it.
[4:04:26] <%DesertPenguin> I couldn't believe I beat the game first time without Air Control
[4:04:31] <%gamewarden92> some sort of deity one would say
[4:04:39] <%DesertPenguin> I chose not to because I prioritized other things, but damn it's helpful sometimes

[4:06:18] <PA_Master> @WoolieVersus If you hold down right click you can keep it Deployed without firing, which helps with overheating
[4:06:23] <%GeneralSCPatton> YOU DON'T HAVE TO FIRE CONTINUOUSLY. JUST DON'T DROP TURRET.
[4:06:28] <%Zebroneath> You don't have to do it all in one continuous burst

[4:08:54] <FeelinNifty> I only poopoo farted
[4:09:05] <+Cavumentum> Yeah but this time it's Organic Synthetic Argent Energy, now with 100% far less Demons
[4:09:05] <%lewdskeletor13> Yeah but the synthetic energy helped them against the demons tho
[4:09:07] <$legacy0117> Also guys, why the ice grenade is taking so long to stop cooling down is because you invested loads of points into the Flame Belch.
[4:09:12] <alexandrecau> It's not synthetic yet, he is using the hell crucible as conduit to the real shit
[4:09:13] <@Solidus_113> what a guy

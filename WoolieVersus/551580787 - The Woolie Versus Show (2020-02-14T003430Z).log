[0:59:40] <gordieda20> LUL
[0:59:40] <Ryong> really though? does someone really have to?
[0:59:44] <KAISERWAVE> laffff
[0:59:45] <laguerrilha> LUL
[0:59:45] <%Solidnick18> Woolie is keeping the scene alive
[0:59:46] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you are the scene woolz
[0:59:46] <arkv01> there's a scene... for those who open up their hearts to SNK heroines
[0:59:52] <%Haarute> someone's gotta cash in on that sweet SNK Heroines demographic
[0:59:54] <rad_dude123465> Woolie you are the scene
[0:59:56] <gordieda20> Woolie is the scene LUL
[0:59:58] <SirBrawler18> Something about this HUD really bothers me
[1:00:05] <Ryong> this is just line-kill spirits again
[1:00:10] <%Exiliator> Ohohoho!
[1:00:12] <kingkeldeo31> Aren't there different supers depending on the direction or something?
[1:00:13] <arkv01> I think I LOVE EVERYTHING about this game tbh LUL
[1:00:14] <KAISERWAVE> haha
[1:00:18] <DSD24> Fem Iori is doing things
[1:00:20] <%Solidnick18> So chaos code
[1:00:22] <Breakfast_Megapowers> Woolie as the EVO grand champion of SNK Heroines what costumes or characters would you like to see added to your FAVORITE fighting game? @WoolieVersus
[1:00:27] <%Superbro64> I hope to see sylvie in kof xv, I kinda like her
[1:00:28] <Zelretch3000> ngl this game looks cool
[1:00:28] <laguerrilha> The voice actresses are not the problem here
[1:00:41] <hassanico2> Why is she wearing Banderas' clothes?
[1:00:45] <KAISERWAVE> We actually had an EVO Japan side tournament for this
[1:00:45] <nothuzad> I mean you can play granblue again in 1 or 2 months when the entire S1 pass is out :V
[1:00:50] <%Superbro64> you definitely arent seeing love heart or the pachinko girls again tho. They are gone forever
[1:00:56] <+PJSmooth> because it makes her uncomfortable
[1:01:02] <DSD24> Woolie loves Nelsons car gloves
[1:01:04] <NecronomidoI> @KAISERWAVE HeyGuys
[1:01:04] <hassanico2> Is Kukri not playable?
[1:01:05] <KAISERWAVE> Yeah hardcore play
[1:01:06] <arkv01> REDEEMED
[1:01:09] <%jiggy_snipe> I don't understand the fetish of putting her in Banderas costume
[1:01:12] <laguerrilha> PRO

[1:01:42] <grimenigma> what have they done to iori jadeSigh
[1:01:44] <TigerClaws12> so when's the rollback patch for this game? Kappa
[1:01:45] <Dragon_Batman> Yup Fem Iori
[1:01:50] <kingkeldeo31> Don't question their clothing, Kukri somehow gets powerful from the girls' embarassment
[1:01:52] <Ryong> Nakoruru's dagger also doesn't want anything to do with this whole deal
[1:01:52] <+PJSmooth> @jiggy_snipe kukri wanted to make all the girls in this as uncomfortable as possible
[1:01:55] <laguerrilha> That birb wants no part in this travesty
[1:02:01] <Ryong> which is why it only shows up during moves that use it
[1:02:04] <laguerrilha> it has a reputation to mantain
[1:02:06] <SheefEatsBeef> what the fuck are all these stickers dog
[1:02:10] <hassanico2> Chat what part of the band is Iori?
[1:02:12] <+Jaqmarius> Mui Mui is just Xiangfei in hot pants.
[1:02:15] <%Exiliator> You dont know that, you dont speak bird
[1:02:18] <DSD24> Don't tell me that a Guitar Cancel doesn't sound awesome
[1:02:22] <kingkeldeo31> Iori plays bass
[1:02:23] <+BurkeBigsby> lol reggie is just trying to annoy woolie at this rate.
[1:02:25] <mr_miyagichu> iori is a bassist I think

[1:09:07] <KAISERWAVE> and maybe people took it too seriously? It's truly a party fighting game
[1:09:11] <Kalinflip> Personally I think Snk did a bad job by even making this game in the first place
[1:09:23] <SuckPuppet> they presented the game perfectly well
[1:09:23] <mr_miyagichu> welcome to snk heroines, the hypest shit ever

[3:27:21] <%OldManJEWc> I will actually pick this up real good quick and try and play. big hype lol
[3:27:32] <Finakala> Did Woolie ever play Arcana Heart on stream?
[3:27:42] <Chronoreyer> once again, for anyone looking to try this game out, its actually pretty easy to learn to play!
[3:27:44] <@Solidus_113> nope
[3:28:16] <Chronoreyer> combos are not difficult and pretty straightforward, neutral is pretty freeform
[3:28:17] <Das_Wood> i just got here was that a stand?
[3:28:26] <SilverInferno3> Essentially yes
[3:28:40] <GeltonZ> Hermes is a summoner so she has like 3 or 4 stands
[3:28:48] <SilverInferno3> If it's the Star Platinum one then yes in every way
[3:29:02] <NeroInfinite> rip captain
[3:29:06] <Chronoreyer> thats the setplay super
[3:29:08] <@Solidus_113> Time to retire, Sagit

[3:29:16] <%Solidnick18> i'm pretty bad at fight games but i like watching woolieMIRIN
[3:29:34] <%Exiliator> 🔔 🔔
[3:29:38] <%winds_0f_change> is the red stand supposed to be magicians red?
[3:29:46] <GeltonZ> This game is made by the people who made Super Cosplay Wars so there are a LOT of anime references in here. Celia 2 Kai's entire moveset is based on Shin Getter Robo
[3:29:52] <Hoarseplay> Damn. My PS4 has to update.
[3:30:05] <chronoxgp> I was researching this game and came across a listing for "Arcana Heart 3: Love Max Six Stars Xtend!!!!
[3:30:08] <%Exiliator> 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔
[3:30:18] <SilverInferno3> @GeltonZ Does that include the move where her boobs explode
[3:30:19] <@Solidus_113> tragic
[3:30:21] <%Solidnick18> Ring your bell
[3:30:24] <@Solidus_113> I can't believe Sagit is dead
[3:30:32] <SilverInferno3> Gave it your best dood
[3:30:43] <mephium> he came back from the dead to die again
[3:30:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's 20 bucks
[3:30:51] <%Exiliator> yeah on pc :(
[3:30:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> and it downloads fuast
[3:30:54] <@Solidus_113> it's $4 on PC
[3:30:55] <%CaptainPileDriver> *fast
[3:30:58] <SilverInferno3> Reggie, quote machine today
[3:31:03] <Finakala> Arcana Heart is fun @chronoxgp
[3:31:10] <Hoarseplay> This is probably the most advertising this game ever got and that's really sad.
[3:31:19] <%Irridium> In the first age...
[3:31:22] <chronoxgp> arcana heart has some crunchy pixel art
[3:31:22] <%Exiliator> Real OG
[3:31:24] <%Solidnick18> The old guard
[3:31:27] <Chronoreyer> hoarseplay you are actually 100% correct
[3:31:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> wish i actually was good at fight games
[3:31:31] <Hoarseplay> Oh yeah, Max played this for like, a week.
[3:31:32] <Chronoreyer> and it really sucks
[3:31:50] <Chronoreyer> I tried to get people to pick up and enter tournaments for this game for a while
[3:31:57] <Finakala> I do remember hearing about Chaos Code a few years ago but never got around to picking it up
[3:32:05] <Chronoreyer> in the end there was a handful of people in our reigon that played and got pretty good, but thats about it
[3:32:18] <Finakala> Oh yeah this is Akihabara alright
[3:32:25] <Hoarseplay> Cthylla is Cthulhu's daughter and also a magical girl.
[3:32:26] <Finakala> I recognize it
[3:32:26] <Chronoreyer> small pockets of pretty good people in like 5 different reigons maybe
[3:32:29] <chronoxgp> futa cafe right on the side
[3:32:34] <SilverInferno3> Shoutout to old lady cop
[3:32:36] <Applecannon63> a ganguro cthylla

[3:35:21] <@chesterr01> @geltonz 👍👍
[3:35:47] <GeltonZ> This game has that Waku Waku 7 energy to it. It's so wonderfully goofy.
[3:36:01] <GeltonZ> And yes, Cthylla is Cthulu's daughter.
[3:36:32] <SilverInferno3> That's rad
[3:36:35] <Finakala> Bravo looks super fun to play
[3:37:52] <SilverInferno3> So far Bravo has been the hero of the stream yeah

[3:38:21] <Mvrdok_> LUL
[3:38:26] <Chronoreyer> @WoolieVersus command normals in this game are like kof, if you chain into it the move has different properties
[3:38:29] <%yeknomlive> is this for glory?
[3:38:33] <SilverInferno3> What a god, of a gamer
[3:38:55] <+snarfton23> jermaMars

[3:39:57] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:40:07] <SilverInferno3> Bye @Exiliator KonCha
[3:40:12] <Hoarseplay> @chromdad It's fun and busted in all the right ways.
[3:40:14] <Chronoreyer> in the vanilla version of this game, kudlak had a fireball that was +1 anywhere on the screen
[3:40:15] <Finakala> Night @Exiliator
[3:40:16] <Chronoreyer> he was a bastard
[3:40:25] <GeltonZ> This is actually in my top 5 favorite fighters of all time
[3:40:44] <Finakala> Is this guy just summoning RE4 Regenerators
[3:40:51] <%drefizz> LOL
[3:40:58] <chromdad> Busted fun > balanced limited “fun”
[3:41:29] <Hoarseplay> This game is absolute insanity at high level.
[3:41:43] <SilverInferno3> Fuck MvC2 put this in Evo
[3:41:49] <SilverInferno3> Wiz you coward
[3:41:56] <Hoarseplay> It was at EVO_JP
[3:42:02] <Das_Wood> we got more stands baby
[3:42:02] <Hoarseplay> Side tournament, but still.
[3:42:14] <SilverInferno3> I demand main stage
[3:42:17] <Finakala> To be fair the best game at EVO last year was Windjammers don't @ me
[3:42:32] <%jiggy_snipe> sucks about the sequel, maybe it would have been another UNIST
[3:42:35] <chromdad> Why @ the truth
[3:42:40] <ThousandDogs> who's gonna @ you when you right
[3:42:41] <kaine_west> Get rid of smasat EVO instead Kappa
[3:42:46] <Chronoreyer> this game would never have been another unist
[3:42:50] <Chronoreyer> its too old for most people
[3:42:53] <kaine_west> Smash
[3:43:02] <%Irridium> replace every game with this. every bracket. Fuck it.
[3:43:16] <chromdad> Too mich smash player money and attendants and views
[3:43:24] <mr_miyagichu> lets have an idie evo with this and skullgirls
[3:43:26] <SilverInferno3> If this game got GGPO it'd be popular, I swear
[3:43:35] <%Superbro64> its kinda funny how people think the sequel was teased a few weeks back, there was a trailer at least a year and a half ago
[3:43:39] <Chronoreyer> theres a roll
[3:43:40] <Chronoreyer> lol
[3:43:49] <GeltonZ> The problem is that the main guy behind this game died 2 years ago, that's why NEXT was cancelled. His brother tried to continue without him but couldn't.
[3:43:49] <%Superbro64> I do hope the dev gets back on his feet
[3:43:50] <SilverInferno3> Also shit was that a perfect?
[3:43:53] <Man_in_the_Red> @silverinferno3 no... no it wont
[3:43:53] <Finakala> I'm still disappointed and surprised how little rep Skullgirls seems to get
[3:43:59] <kaine_west> This game rocks
[3:44:04] <Man_in_the_Red> anyone else play Skullgirls Kappa
[3:44:06] <arkv01> @GeltonZ oh fuck FeelsBadMan
[3:44:15] <Chronoreyer> @WoolieVersus can I get the runback
[3:44:19] <Man_in_the_Red> trick question Kappa
[3:44:19] <arkv01> we all play skullgirls... in our hearts
[3:44:27] <Finakala> :<
[3:44:28] <SilverInferno3> @Man_in_the_Red Yeah I was just joking lol
[3:44:36] <Hoarseplay> There's a Boss variant of every character. Like Gold characters in Guilty Gear.
[3:44:38] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> Yo I'm scisless thanks for the match woolie
[3:44:41] <Hoarseplay> You haveto buy them.
[3:44:42] <kaine_west> No more sequel feelsbadman

[3:45:33] <SilverInferno3> Nun = fetish for Woolie
[3:45:47] <Applecannon63> I mean Kyrie
[3:45:49] <Finakala> I want to try to learn Cthylla since I love her design but she looks like a character I won't get on with gameplay wise
[3:45:52] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL I see Woolie
[3:46:02] <%Irridium> so that's what woolie likes
[3:46:18] <Hoarseplay> @Finakala Characters are all really simple to get into if you have a basic understanding of fighting games.
[3:46:47] <Finakala> I'll give everyone a shot tomorrow and see what feels good
[3:47:04] <Hoarseplay> Also, everything juggles in this game. IT's super nuts.

[3:53:42] <%Superbro64> one of these days I will see max mode combos online
[3:53:47] <%Superbro64> one day...
[3:54:04] <%Superbro64> good stuff there @chronoreyer
[3:54:04] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1227284596695404550?s=19
[3:54:13] <Chronoreyer> I could do vein's max combo on netplay but its not really worth it
[3:54:18] <Chronoreyer> meter is too valuable for neutral
[3:54:27] <+NotHereToStream> do it for the style
[3:54:27] <%Superbro64> but the STYLE points tho
[3:54:40] <Chronoreyer> haha, I think the big boy bnb is cooler than the max mode combo
[3:54:42] <SilverInferno3> Thata boy
[3:54:42] <mephium> is he pretending? NotLikeThis
[3:54:44] <Chronoreyer> his is pretty easy
[3:54:53] <%Irridium> LUL
[3:54:54] <Chronoreyer> but the big boy combo has like 3 2f rejump links
[3:54:55] <SilverInferno3> RAW
[3:54:57] <NeroInfinite> LUL
[3:54:57] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[3:55:00] <%Superbro64> is max combos particularly hard to do on netplay?
[3:55:07] <Chronoreyer> depends on the character
[3:55:20] <@Solidus_113> Reggie playing woolieFUN
[3:55:29] <scrumbotime> The More Oppressive Characters
[3:55:46] <Chronoreyer> rui's max combo is really easy
[3:55:51] <%Superbro64> good ol anime degeneracy

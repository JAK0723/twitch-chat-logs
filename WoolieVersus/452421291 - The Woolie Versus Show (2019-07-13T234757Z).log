[0:30:08] <%gigacanuck> @crimsonharvest but have they gotten exceedingly efficient at it?
[0:30:08] <EddieMayNot> Cyber Sleuth is good shit.
[0:30:09] <$cureneckbeard> They can't import Pokemon from other regions because of Brexit
[0:30:12] <+HellCopter> No it'll be fine. Just not as great as we'd hope.
[0:30:12] <majima666> i keep on meaning to go through black and white but i keep on getting sidetracked
[0:30:12] <@Menitta> No it's been bad for almost a decade now
[0:30:13] <MyNameIsRasus> Yes
[0:30:13] <Prevot> there is also a very unfavorable comparison to Dragon Quest 11
[0:30:14] <JustTaven> The gameplay? it's solid. Models? FUCK YES IT DOES.
[0:30:15] <Sphincter_Spelunker> IT'S ABOUT COLLECTING.
[0:30:15] <Djinnazz> it's been the same game for 20 years.
[0:30:16] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> Digimon wins again
[0:30:18] <Snookasaurus> botched since X and Y
[0:30:19] <aeonicvector> Pokemon dead, long live 3rd party pokemmos and Digimon

[0:30:34] <+Machoman9900> lirikK
[0:30:35] <$FuqBoiSlim> Pokemon hasn't been hitting since 2012 to be quite honest with you y'all
[0:30:35] <+mobius_won> Bw2 was the end of good pokemon
[0:30:36] <+CJett92> I've been on and off for the last 10 years, its not great
[0:30:38] <%rytyoung> It's just such a stagnant series that never changes
[0:30:42] <worldbrand> I would call it consistently better than the sum of its parts, but boy are those parts getting worse and worse
[0:30:43] <wohdin> pirate master race

[0:53:07] <+Nomicro4u> Pat is one of those people who pulls downs both his pants and underwear at urinals
[0:53:08] <RubberFistFight> @WoolieVersus Pat is right, if you poop naked, you can then jump immediately in the shower so you can scrub yourself and cry at what a disgusting human being you are. He'll understand the sentiment :P

[0:54:02] <hamsterdavidson> Woolie is doing a great job blocking all of this Pat-rant
[0:54:03] <h_e_n_t_a_i_i> Why would wear clothing in the bathroom
[0:54:03] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Woolie just turn off the stream to fix it. You‚Äôre only giving Pat power.
[0:54:03] <hard_bop_sax_solo> pat: always ready for butt stuff
[0:54:04] <+Darren716> What the actual fuck pat?
[0:54:04] <happyface699> Exactly
[0:54:05] <vingadivo> i do that unironically
[0:54:05] <CptBritches> Do you hold the toilet paper out away from the toilet the whole time like an idiot too?
[0:54:05] <Jammho> Make the bad man stop wooly
[0:54:05] <+Nomicro4u> By that logic Piss and Poo particles are in your lungs if you breath in the bathroom
[0:54:07] <alrobot2014> but pat the particles will spread throughout the room if you do that
[0:54:07] <%Kavtech> I DO THAT
[0:54:08] <worldbrand> I incinerate my clothes
[0:54:09] <+BopBeep> It's been an hour...
[0:54:09] <Sphincter_Spelunker> shower with poop gas
[0:54:10] <+terminallyCapriciousz> this is the most wasteful
[0:54:11] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Pat is full of shit, we've seen him go to the bathroom on the podcast
[0:54:12] <Fujiwara_92> Pat's right
[0:54:13] <+stagemage> Most recent trop[hy A Great Need for a Shower
[0:54:13] <$FuqBoiSlim> What made you like this
[0:54:14] <+linSP> You ingest poop particles everytime you fart
[0:54:14] <zenith0111> LUL
[0:54:15] <shotgunspaghetti> the good part about this, is that they can start every episode with a stinger from this bullshit that's happening LOOK AT THE POSITIVE SIDE
[0:54:15] <$cureneckbeard> brain gobolins
[0:54:16] <DonatelloJose> and that's why Pat doesn't poop in public places.
[0:54:18] <+SkaNinja> sometimes the mess is SOOO big, you gotta shower after
[0:54:20] <Ranryu692> Pat's water bill must be something to see
[0:54:20] <MasterDecoder> That is not the reason
[0:54:20] <ShreddingPixels> ...
[0:54:20] <Forgottenheck> PunOko PunOko PunOko KonCha
[0:54:22] <+rdark_ksu> if ya poo ya might as well just go back to bed and start over
[0:54:22] <%gigacanuck> but Pat, why not just run around naked all day then?
[0:54:23] <+axebird> What????
[0:54:24] <prince_ire> There are in truck stops
[0:54:24] <+NWR_James> Pat what
[0:54:24] <$Louie_Salmon> Unless you get creative
[0:54:24] <rytisone> but what if you gotta?
[0:54:25] <vingadivo> pat is goddamn right
[0:54:25] <Tha_Mik> I mean...
[0:54:25] <+vicious_rage> you can improvise with a sink
[0:54:28] <sonofthedeepsouth> NAH JUST SHIT
[0:54:29] <alcors_wisdom> a sink is a shower if you arent a coward
[0:54:30] <PlainSimpleTailor> DAMMIT PAT, Every time I think you have some shred of sanity you have to do this to me WHYYY
[0:54:30] <+cvp5127> no its the splashback
[0:54:31] <marvel877> You got to take your pants off but keep your shirt on because the shirt acts as a buffer to protect you from any sort of germs on the underside of the toilet lid that you may or may not lean back against.
[0:54:31] <Gerik1233> NO!
[0:54:31] <zenith0111> HUH
[0:54:31] <vingadivo> TRUR
[0:54:31] <worldbrand> it would be WAY WORSE if there WERE showers
[0:54:31] <LeiaSkynoober> Pat wtf. I thought you were OCD
[0:54:32] <alrobot2014> i can agree with that
[0:54:33] <Junkfist> When are public toilets going to have changing rooms?
[0:54:34] <GarbageQueenEllie> Look at the most recent trophy guys
[0:54:34] <vingadivo> true
[0:54:35] <+kstick07> NotLikeThis
[0:54:36] <AfroKing24> do you take your clothes off to take the trash out?
[0:54:36] <+supergreenmario> pat why are u like that
[0:54:37] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Whenever you flush your toilet it creates a mist that wafts through your whole bathroom and coats every surface with toilet residue. Which includes your toothbrush
[0:54:38] <happyface699> Damn right
[0:54:39] <%SirGO0SE> the number 1 reason you SHOULD use public bathrooms is what if you might shit your pants
[0:54:40] <@Menitta> is it OBS?
[0:54:41] <hard_bop_sax_solo> Just dunk a wad of toilet paper in the toilet water and use the moist wad to do the final wipe
[0:54:41] <+Antoids> what about at the gym
[0:54:41] <KLouDraws> so is that what happens whenever your run off stream to use the bathroom, Pat? lol
[0:54:43] <+VariousOminousDrones> Japanese squat toilets are the worst.
[0:54:45] <The_Swedish_X> Pat is either really good at making up bullshit on the spot, or is actually this crazy.
[0:54:45] <+CJett92> unmute it

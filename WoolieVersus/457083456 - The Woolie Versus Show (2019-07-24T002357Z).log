[0:15:39] <Ninjagregory98> He looks like an edgy robotnik
[0:15:44] <%FuqBoiSlim> I want half-blood demon babies with nyotengu
[0:15:47] <C_game_me_811> The boss from the first game WutFace
[0:15:49] <Guntanks_in_Space> she still also has the nose in some of the costumes
[0:15:53] <absolute_cagemony> Isn't Raidou just Kano from MK
[0:15:54] <Rawklobstah88> grls are gross
[0:15:54] <%Gamefriendly> @absolute_cagemony that kinda sounds like PS All stars
[0:15:57] <Rawklobstah88> They have cooties
[0:15:57] <nmaten> yeah hes pretty much lord genome
[0:15:58] <Guntanks_in_Space> also yea i see lordgenome in raidou looks-wise
[0:15:59] <%mistersups> Yeah pretty much
[0:16:02] <%SirGO0SE> hes like noob saibot meets hitachi visually to me at least
[0:16:02] <+EastwindGuru> When's Hentai!?
[0:16:03] <%gatorafan> He looks like he trains with Akuma.
[0:16:04] <Guntanks_in_Space> but his moveset is a hodgepodge of everything
[0:16:05] <%TheGershon> Is that papa nier?
[0:16:09] <Guntanks_in_Space> also remember that Raidou is Honkers' dad
[0:16:11] <absolute_cagemony> Well then it's a shame that game never caught on... I guess...
[0:16:19] <Guntanks_in_Space> and Ayane's :v
[0:16:19] <ZippyPsycho> @Guntanks_in_Space And Ayane
[0:16:29] <%Gamefriendly> yeah it wasn't really good
[0:16:43] <r956> Raidou is rapper he hurt girl and boy
[0:16:44] <@Menitta> It was a stand made to promote a 2012 event
[0:16:51] <absolute_cagemony> On second thought I'd rather that not be the flagship of the mechanic I want.

[0:17:47] <C_game_me_811> @rawklobstah88 LUL
[0:17:51] <%mistersups> Thanks for lying to me Woolie
[0:17:53] <nmaten> blocking is for cowards
[0:18:00] <+chrishnaw> He's the only character in the game with projectiles, right?
[0:18:02] <absolute_cagemony> his abs look great
[0:18:04] <absolute_cagemony> all 18 of them
[0:18:20] <didgereedoodah> Nyo has a projectile
[0:18:20] <gordieda20> LUL
[0:18:40] <%wolfofsound> Hitomi Jcup?!
[0:18:47] <Phosphorescence_King> Kula is the only character with a GOOD projectile.
[0:18:48] <Superdandy96> 18 pack and here I am with a Keg. Kappa
[0:18:49] <absolute_cagemony> fuck projectiles being added to games that shouldn't have them
[0:18:53] <absolute_cagemony> they ruined tekken
[0:18:53] <Kdillman> play Wong. Drunken fighters = best fighters
[0:18:55] <%FuqBoiSlim> HITOMI Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[0:19:00] <%alexandrecau> hitomi c cup really
[0:19:04] <%TheGershon> They need to pick Honoka at some point for dat Kira Buckland
[0:19:04] <%wolfofsound> @Kdillman I agree
[0:19:07] <r956> Pick girl please
[0:19:09] <+PhantomExdeath> Hitomi macawGasm

[0:19:18] <%FuqBoiSlim> hmmmm?
[0:19:21] <Guntanks_in_Space> and here's Hitomi, my old main
[0:19:25] <$BappoSama> Not really, your controllers are different colors..
[0:19:25] <Kdillman> @wolfofsound premium taste detected
[0:19:30] <absolute_cagemony> Did you know that in the past DOA games had a "girls only" setting so the CPU would only pick girls for you to fight against?
[0:20:14] <%FuqBoiSlim> HITOMI HAS TO WHEN SO I CAN SEE HER VICTORY SCREEN AGAIN
[0:20:16] <Guntanks_in_Space> and here's worst boi Hayate
[0:20:18] <MTLxSpider> Did you know DOA6 Was at umad2019 :O
[0:20:20] <C_game_me_811> The one good thing about honkers LUL
[0:20:20] <MTLxSpider> Kappa
[0:20:21] <Guntanks_in_Space> fuck Hayate, Ein's better
[0:20:22] <%FuqBoiSlim> *WIN
[0:20:22] <+chrishnaw> DOA is super not balanced for projectiles
[0:20:26] <absolute_cagemony> It's called Dead or Alive because their core audience is so thirsty they live or die based on if they get a sip of those sweet Polygirls...
[0:20:27] <TimetodiveLTX> the root of the problem is-
[0:20:38] <C_game_me_811> * the VO
[0:20:41] <Kdillman> DoA isn't even balanced for non-volleyball gameplay
[0:20:48] <absolute_cagemony> Also Hitomi is best girl.
[0:20:49] <thepiefoot> It's called Dead or Alive cause most of it's fanbase is dead Kappa
[0:20:49] <%deadredeyez> deadredeyez subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[0:21:02] <Phosphorescence_King> @thepiefoot Oof

[0:21:36] <Guntanks_in_Space> DOA, france's second most popular fighter
[0:21:40] <absolute_cagemony> I need some gamer girl bath water to sooth the burns from those harsh browns you're serving @thepiefoot
[0:21:40] <Guntanks_in_Space> for some reason
[0:21:45] <Kdillman> And for those who say "never": I know :C
[0:21:52] <%Who_lio42> gotta throw the break blow
[0:21:52] <ashuckel> oh hey, it's Honkers
[0:21:59] <$Tuskor13> It's called Dead or Alice because the playerbase wants to own Marie Rose bath water whether they're dead or alive Kappa
[0:22:03] <+DarkNerdShawny> Thats not honkers
[0:22:06] <+Nomicro4u> So is there any hope for DOA 7 now that 6 has flopped?
[0:22:08] <%FuqBoiSlim> honkers is honoka
[0:22:13] <Kdillman> i this its a honkers
[0:22:15] <%wolfofsound> she's not honkers she's beepers

[0:23:12] <%wolfofsound> yes @KitsuneManami
[0:23:15] <Kdillman> Does anyone remember the time Team Ninja was like "We're gonna make a normal fighting game, guys" and them promptly did not do that?
[0:23:16] <@akuda_bar> pay $20 to REMOVE all the lewd content
[0:23:17] <+chrishnaw> Woolie is not a man of Values
[0:23:17] <KitsuneManami> Good Goood
[0:23:18] <+Nomicro4u> They should have made core values mode mandatory and made a DLC to remove it
[0:23:33] <nmaten> Reggie just wants to be able to zoom in on her feet
[0:23:34] <PumpkinSong> @akuda_bar they patched that in for free
[0:23:34] <%wolfofsound> woolie picked her first thing
[0:23:39] <+Nomicro4u> $100 season pass to disable core value smode
[0:23:44] <absolute_cagemony> Reggie is enjoying Hitomi's bare feet.
[0:23:55] <absolute_cagemony> They're causing him to choke.
[0:24:01] <C_game_me_811> @kdillman Are you talking about this game
[0:24:05] <+chrishnaw> I think we're all enjoying Hitomi's bare feet

[0:25:22] <Phosphorescence_King> No
[0:25:23] <Guntanks_in_Space> hitomi is cool, though is still pick Ein over her as the Karate rep
[0:25:32] <Guntanks_in_Space> they're both cool as fuck still tho
[0:25:35] <Phosphorescence_King> Throw straight loses to strikes.
[0:25:37] <Ion_Laser> @nomicro4u Can't stop Won't stop
[0:25:42] <absolute_cagemony> Hitomi vs Marie Rose plz
[0:25:49] <KitsuneManami> Mai Mai Mai
[0:25:52] <absolute_cagemony> big boob vs flat chest, the eternal battle for dominance
[0:25:52] <TimetodiveLTX> DOA6's presentation is why UNIST is at EVO instead
[0:25:52] <+Nomicro4u> grabs have no priority
[0:25:54] <thepiefoot> Tekken doesn't do that
[0:25:56] <Kdillman> needs more Wong
[0:25:56] <+BurkeBigsby> Yeah. My brother used to destroy me trying to throw like it's SF.
[0:25:57] <%FuqBoiSlim> Ryona is a bottom tier kink but I'm not surprised its popular with fighting game characters
[0:25:57] <%Who_lio42> throws can't Counter hit, like VF
[0:25:58] <%gatorafan> The Bass Kappa
[0:26:05] <Guntanks_in_Space> wait throws CAN counter
[0:26:11] <Guntanks_in_Space> but they have to punish a whiffed hold
[0:26:13] <Phosphorescence_King> Grabs are good for whiff punishing and block punishing, and beating counters.
[0:26:15] <Kdillman> oh god, Nico
[0:26:23] <Kdillman> The worst OC in recent fighting games
[0:26:25] <absolute_cagemony> Nico: Definitely 18.
[0:26:27] <%TheGershon> Is it pronounced Base or Bass?
[0:26:27] <%FuqBoiSlim> NIC pknLUL
[0:26:31] <+Nomicro4u> Grabs are supposed to be used to crush counters
[0:26:33] <%Who_lio42> they can't also counter throws, but i meant attacks
[0:26:33] <+paladinstarbuster> Try and grab somebody during a kick
[0:26:34] <thepiefoot> Base
[0:26:38] <+chrishnaw> Ayane's the best character I don't enjoy playing as.
[0:26:50] <%Who_lio42> unless its an Offensive Hold.
[0:26:51] <hamahiroyuki> is this brazilian accent? other guests had that too
[0:26:53] <+PhantomExdeath> Nico worst than SFV Fang? nahhh
[0:27:08] <@SoushinSen> yeaaah NiCO
[0:27:10] <proto_char> Ehhh Nico's cute
[0:27:15] <Phosphorescence_King> Fang is the light of the world.
[0:27:15] <thepiefoot> Nico: she is a scientist !
[0:27:18] <Kdillman> I'd actually put Fang above Nico because I'm crazy like that
[0:27:19] <Guntanks_in_Space> the DOA triangle goes like Attacks get beat by Holds, Holds get beat by Throws, and throws get beat by Attacks
[0:27:23] <+Nomicro4u> Nico nico niii
[0:27:24] <+BurkeBigsby> Bayman Rolling ankle grab was the most fun to cheese with.

[0:27:54] <Kdillman> and feet beat Reggie
[0:27:54] <artoflec> i like Hayate's look too
[0:27:55] <Guntanks_in_Space> oh yeah Fang exists, but in DOA context I don't like her design-wise
[0:28:00] <+ducethegamer> fighting in heels
[0:28:12] <didgereedoodah> ninja heels tho

[0:28:25] <%gatorafan> Ehhh, a lot of things can be a fighting character. I don't think the requirements are strict at all.
[0:28:29] <Phosphorescence_King> Nico does JoJo poses though.
[0:28:36] <%FuqBoiSlim> J

[0:43:00] <@Squdnate> Best character
[0:43:05] <+generalve> when did stream start ?
[0:43:08] <Phosphorescence_King> Compared to Ryu?
[0:43:08] <+DarkNerdShawny> Pai > Lei Fang tho

[0:43:11] <%Solidnick18> ayane is a cool ninja

[0:43:16] <+BurkeBigsby> Morgana?
[0:43:22] <didgereedoodah> Lei Fang is so cool
[0:43:22] <+zanzibar_junker> Leifang has no older lady charm
[0:43:27] <Rawklobstah88> Woah now
[0:43:39] <+zanzibar_junker> Compared 2 chun
[0:43:44] <Rawklobstah88> Kasumi, slow down, at least take her to dinner first.
[0:43:56] <%fFailureatlife> chun is classy
[0:44:06] <thepiefoot> Chun is prolly a grandma by now
[0:44:08] <+generalve> tell me why Pat's thinks VF is better. this looks so much faster and better
[0:44:15] <@Menitta> One of my biggest peeves in games is when a character has a visible knife on a costume and it isnt used
[0:44:19] <%FuqBoiSlim> @generalve Old good new bad
[0:44:21] <+chrishnaw> The cheongsam crop top is SS+ Tier
[0:44:23] <%wolfofsound> I bet Leifang has never once said "Ara Ara"
[0:44:34] <@Menitta> oh there it is...
[0:44:41] <len_713> loll
[0:44:42] <%Solidnick18> it's very loose
[0:44:43] <+DarkNerdShawny> VF and Doa is about the same level. Both are the best 3D fighter. Better than Tekken
[0:44:43] <+generalve> tekken is more technical
[0:44:51] <@Squdnate> VF plays more technical, and much more punishing than DoA
[0:44:58] <@Squdnate> You do stupid in VF, you are gonna have a mark
[0:45:07] <Guntanks_in_Space> @generalve not Pat, but VF is better because it's tighter-knit and the mechanics are smoooth and satisfying. but more punishing yea
[0:45:09] <+generalve> but counter system though....
[0:45:10] <Kdillman> VF needs a comeback
[0:45:11] <thepiefoot> Pat hates DOA cause it killed VF
[0:45:18] <+Nomicro4u> its like 20% or something
[0:45:23] <Phosphorescence_King> Counterhit damage is serious.
[0:45:25] <prime_name> Akira, the famous DOA character
[0:45:25] <+Nomicro4u> I forget
[0:45:26] <Goraka91> VF doesn't have waifus
[0:45:27] <Guntanks_in_Space> it's funny that DOA and VF are compared to each other considering DOA1 was built on VF2's skeleton
[0:45:29] <@Menitta> VF is so punishing, Sega stopped making them Kappa
[0:45:30] <C_game_me_811> VF Kreygasm also BibleThump
[0:45:34] <BalloniWright> didn't Tekke killed VF?
[0:45:34] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:45:35] <Guntanks_in_Space> i.e. Same arcade board even
[0:45:36] <PumpkinSong> @Kdillman come back from what
[0:45:45] <+DarkNerdShawny> Bring all the VF characters.....and put them in DOA!!
[0:45:49] <Kdillman> VF can just hide in Yakuza games until they are ready to reveal the butterfly it's be turning into
[0:45:51] <+generalve> did they just start ?
[0:45:57] <%wolfofsound> !uptime
[0:45:58] <Rawklobstah88> Is it me or is Kasumi just...not interesting at all?
[0:45:58] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 19 minutes
[0:45:59] <C_game_me_811> @balloniwright That’s Sega

[0:46:05] <@Squdnate> VF6, now with Sonic

[0:46:12] <thepiefoot> @Kdillman Cue VF6 with KOF14 graphics Kappa
[0:46:14] <Rawklobstah88> Her only redeeming factor is her yabos.
[0:46:14] <Kdillman> VF6, now with Kiryu

[0:48:19] <thepiefoot> Is Helena dress supposed to be... "classy"?
[0:48:20] <%Solidnick18> i can't believe they put mai in twice

[0:49:05] <Goraka91> @Solidnick18 I mean it's basically the exact same game as last time, even the same $1500 worth of DLC
[0:49:06] <%gatorafan> Akira? That Yakuza minigame character made it to DoA? Why didn't they add Kiryu instead? Kappa
[0:49:13] <+Nomicro4u> HOW CAN SHE SLAP
[0:49:13] <%FuqBoiSlim> ITS NOT THAT SAME
[0:49:17] <prime_name> The animation looks so smooth in this game.

[0:50:28] <Goraka91> I will never forgive the Japanese for the Marie Rose/Lucky Chloe archetype DansGame
[0:50:29] <%Slayerrcks> but you just throw side step
[0:50:38] <@Menitta> Mai and Kula are from KOFXIV specifically apparently
[0:50:40] <hamahiroyuki> @thepiefoot as far as i know i dont think so
[0:50:46] <+generalve> ZEKE
[0:50:51] <%fFailureatlife> fFailureatlife subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 8 month streak! are you gonna buy the two season passes Kappa
[0:50:56] <C_game_me_811> @goraka91 Same DansGame
[0:50:57] <%gatorafan> Are Marie and Chloe even the same archetype?
[0:51:00] <BalloniWright> tutorial is long
[0:51:14] <coreybom> @goraka91 They decided to tap into the look market. horribly DansGame
[0:51:21] <%MightyMaxT> I think it's because Kula's costume is based on her KOF14 appearance
[0:51:29] <outerenoshima> rxtroTea i think Marie is pretty cool
[0:51:32] <coreybom> *Loli
[0:51:32] <Kdillman> @gatorafan depends, how lucky is Marie in comparison?
[0:51:34] <%FuqBoiSlim> women DansGame
[0:51:35] <Guntanks_in_Space> marie's fun to play as too
[0:51:44] <Guntanks_in_Space> but yeah not the biggest fan of her aesthetic
[0:51:50] <Goraka91> Japan is too afraid to admit MILFs are superior DansGame
[0:51:54] <Kdillman> her aesthetic is jail
[0:52:01] <Guntanks_in_Space> and now woolie learns of the multiple stun properties
[0:52:22] <Goraka91> Like Honoka has a really neat fighting style, but it's Honoka
[0:52:24] <coreybom> Marie rose is go straight to jail
[0:52:33] <%gatorafan> Marie is "enough" years old, like Kula. Kappa
[0:52:40] <%MightyMaxT> She's just worse Misa from Death Note

[0:53:25] <Guntanks_in_Space> DID GEESE DIE OR NOT?!
[0:53:27] <%gatorafan> I'd like to thank Ash for that but that's just a convenient excuse.
[0:53:27] <Phosphorescence_King> At least Marie is a scumbag that's pretending to be a whiny kid. Honkers is just weak.
[0:53:32] <+Ace_Flibble> Marie could be 47, she's still horrific Kappa Lisa, Mila, Christie, Tina are the only characters who matter!

[0:54:51] <Phosphorescence_King> Geese in a butt-battle.
[0:54:55] <%gatorafan> I'm sure there is a market for the male characters on an Extreme like game.
[0:54:55] <+Nomicro4u> Marie Rose is not a real person
[0:54:57] <%FuqBoiSlim> "I will stain my ass with your blood"
[0:55:03] <coreybom> @fuqboislim At least milf's and muscle girls are clearly legal adults. can't say the same about Marie rose, or HONKERS
[0:55:10] <Kalinflip> @Kdillman Thats why mom doesnt love you atpCap
[0:55:15] <outerenoshima> @coreybom rxtroLUL she's 18 and a anime character how is she creepy

[0:55:51] <zamzoph> Woolie's right. That's how Hitomi's popular enough to be in Xtreme
[0:55:52] <+DarkNerdShawny> Hitomi J Cup got her name from this Hitomi right?
[0:55:57] <nmaten> the grid?
[0:56:08] <%gatorafan> Japan and Germany have been best friends for a long time Kappa
[0:56:09] <+Ace_Flibble> She's half japanese, yes.
[0:56:10] <+Nomicro4u> Japan likes America too
[0:56:17] <C_game_me_811> @coreybom Agree
[0:56:17] <outerenoshima> @coreybom the game says she's 18 so she's 18 rxtroL

[0:56:28] <coreybom> @fuqboislim Least I don't have to explain that She's "18"
[0:56:35] <Goraka91> Like Attack on Titan, that's pretty damn German
[0:56:46] <Goraka91> But y'know, not
[0:56:48] <zamzoph> aren't Honkers and Marie Rose also not Japanese? But they're popular because they _look_ Japanese
[0:56:49] <+BurkeBigsby> They do have names
[0:56:52] <+Ace_Flibble> Helena also gets a pass in Japan since she's French. All the other western characters get zero love over there.
[0:56:59] <+DarkNerdShawny> They have names
[0:57:01] <thepiefoot> @Goraka91 Marley is pretty German
[0:57:05] <Kdillman> japan loves french
[0:57:21] <Guntanks_in_Space> @zamzoph only marie rose, she's swedish
[0:57:25] <+BurkeBigsby> Command training has it for sure.
[0:57:29] <Kdillman> to a nigh-unsettling degree
[0:57:30] <coreybom> @outerenoshima I reject your weird creepy "L" . Marie is WAAYY too jail bait.
[0:57:31] <%FuqBoiSlim> Japan loves France more than the French love France
[0:57:31] <Guntanks_in_Space> or at least iirc she is lol
[0:57:33] <%gatorafan> Nico is Finland, isn't she?
[0:57:51] <+Nomicro4u> Japan loves the idea of France not actual france
[0:57:52] <BalloniWright> they had names in 5 but not here in 6
[0:57:53] <Goraka91> Doesn't Paris have a specific problem with Japanese tourists getting depressed it's not as amazing as they think it is?
[0:57:55] <%Irridium> I remember Dead or Alive 5 let you just put your moveset on the bottom right/left and it'd just cycle through bayonetta style as you did combos. I miss that so much.
[0:57:58] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeh nico's finnish
[0:58:01] <gamma00> no one loves Actual France
[0:58:03] <Kdillman> @Goraka91 yes
[0:58:10] <Kdillman> Paris Syndrome
[0:58:14] <C_game_me_811> @ace_flibble Pretty much :(
[0:58:15] <Goraka91> That's the one
[0:58:19] <+DarkNerdShawny> Nico is finnish, originally supposed to be russian
[0:58:53] <C_game_me_811> @ace_flibble Do they love French
[0:58:57] <Kalinflip> @DarkNerdShawny How is he originally supposed to be Russian
[0:59:07] <Kalinflip> Im confused not trying to pick a fight LUL
[0:59:08] <Kdillman> I want to introduce everyone who thinks French is a wonderful and romantic language to Quebec French
[0:59:13] <Goraka91> Ah of course Nico would be Russian, can't be Russian without mighty Tesla power
[0:59:21] <Kdillman> nothing stops arousal like French canada
[0:59:21] <+Nomicro4u> TABERNAC
[0:59:23] <outerenoshima> @coreybom I'm just happy the devs of DoA used a different body type other then "tall big tiddy lady"
[0:59:34] <+BurkeBigsby> PRobably in strings
[0:59:38] <+Exyoh> Does Japan love France, or does Japan just love The Rose of Versailles?
[0:59:40] <Phosphorescence_King> Some moves cause good stun on hit, some on counterhit.
[0:59:41] <thepiefoot> I've always hated French, just the way it sounds
[0:59:41] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[0:59:43] <%FuqBoiSlim> Quebec French pknKEK pknKEK pknKEK
[0:59:48] <+BurkeBigsby> because the idea is to cancel their string with your counter?
[0:59:49] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 1 hour. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 4oz (120mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[0:59:49] <%gatorafan> Tesla power was cool in Red Alert.
[0:59:57] <originalvizion> true talk outerenoshima
[1:00:03] <C_game_me_811> @zamzoph Also they love those types of characters lolis and school girls
[1:00:10] <Goraka91> What's with fictional Russians and electricity
[1:00:11] <elrey745> ... is that Travis from no more heroes?
[1:00:12] <+DarkNerdShawny> @Kalinflip they changed it half way in development. The Japanese VA even knows Russian and was going to speak it
[1:00:13] <+Ace_Flibble> Yeah they started using more body types but they're copy&pasting the same face for them...
[1:00:21] <TheBrunoZone> HydraBot Hype PogChamp
[1:00:30] <thepiefoot> It's not a true string, it's a gap
[1:00:33] <originalvizion> the early DoA games all the girls have the exact same bodies
[1:00:34] <Kdillman> Anywho, I've talked about honkers and threw shade at quebec, my job here is done
[1:00:39] <coreybom> @outerenoshima Well, they gone a little too far with "child?" body. I mean, come on man, she's kinda creepy.
[1:00:42] <Phosphorescence_King> Jabs aren't combo starters.
[1:00:57] <originalvizion> Corey the only loli is Marie rose
[1:01:01] <Guntanks_in_Space> @DarkNerdShawny oh they got Sumipe to voice her in JP? yeah, that does explain things lol
[1:01:13] <%FuqBoiSlim> Chat, asking for a friend. but where can I find a pretentious, cigarette smoking, artsy french girl to date? again asking for a friend of mine
[1:01:16] <Goraka91> Also Nico, they're multiplying
[1:01:17] <originalvizion> wathever
[1:01:26] <originalvizion> No shes not
[1:01:26] <%gatorafan> In France, probably.
[1:01:30] <elrey745> Montreal, probably
[1:01:30] <%Irridium> there needs to be a culling
[1:01:31] <Phosphorescence_King> @FuqBoiSlim Huniepop 2
[1:01:34] <PlainSimpleTailor> Is she yelling "SIT" ?
[1:01:37] <Kdillman> @FuqBoiSlim Ottawa
[1:01:41] <Tucker0603> I want a Zarya/Sonya (Diablo 3 barbarian) type woman in more fighting games, made a muscular dark skinned minotaur girl in SC6
[1:01:55] <coreybom> @originalvizion I know, but HONKERS is kinda pushing it with that schoolgirl outfit. And it's not the trashy sexy kind either.
[1:01:56] <+Ace_Flibble> And there's a bunch more that wre added to DOAX3. Luckily they've not come to 6 yet...
[1:01:59] <Sloavon> is the audio out of sync?
[1:02:00] <originalvizion> DoA is pretty fun
[1:02:00] <%FuqBoiSlim> thanks for the answers my friend really appreciated the info
[1:02:05] <Kalinflip> @Tucker0603 Hey alright
[1:02:14] <bonzosan> doa is good game.
[1:02:18] <Kalinflip> Jebaited
[1:02:27] <originalvizion> how the hell is honoka a loli
[1:02:38] <thepiefoot> Tom Brady fucking hates DOA
[1:02:38] <+DarkNerdShawny> nani?
[1:02:40] <Guntanks_in_Space> Hitomi's got a BUNCH of charged moves. the last P in PPP string can be charged. 4P+K is also a charge i think. Or a bunch of her punch strings in general
[1:02:41] <Tucker0603> @kalinflip used asteroths moveset for her, she's BAE
[1:03:04] <originalvizion> Didnt Tom used to play DoA
[1:03:04] <coreybom> @originalvizion I wouldn't say Loli, more uncomfortable fetish. like, they shouldn't be near a highschool.
[1:03:06] <Guntanks_in_Space> i think it has to be a high hold yo
[1:03:11] <+Ace_Flibble> @originalvizion because she looks and acts like an 8 year old who has had breast implants.
[1:03:14] <Phosphorescence_King> Yes, it's real.
[1:03:22] <Kalinflip> @Tucker0603 HEY ALRIGHT atpCap

[1:03:48] <%FuqBoiSlim> Honoka looks 8??? tf kind of kids are yall hanging around with?
[1:03:56] <C_game_me_811> @tucker0603 Zarya barbarian Kreygasm
[1:03:56] <Guntanks_in_Space> none from what i can hear so far @MobiusIII
[1:04:02] <gordieda20> LUL
[1:04:05] <+DarkNerdShawny> The age of conset in Japan is 13-18 depending on the region
[1:04:08] <BalloniWright> @fuqboislim Mentally
[1:04:10] <+DarkNerdShawny> Tokyo is 18
[1:04:10] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> why is it called Dead or Alive if there are no Skeletons among the cast?
[1:04:12] <Goraka91> Hold up
[1:04:15] <Tucker0603> @kalinflip makes asteroths but stomp grab much more enjoyable
[1:04:15] <Kalinflip> Can we get an episode of " Dont get into this fighting game" and make it about DOA6?
[1:04:16] <coreybom> @fuqboislim Not looks 8, but acts 8
[1:04:19] <outerenoshima> this whole "debate" is dumb anyway LUL
[1:04:24] <+Nomicro4u> America also has different ages of consent baesd on State
[1:04:31] <@Menitta> @Breakfast_Megapowers thats a good question
[1:04:32] <%gatorafan> Skeleton are hidden inside the characters
[1:04:35] <coreybom> @nomicro4u And that's cool how?
[1:04:40] <+NarcissistCactus> implying there aren't real women that act like 8 year olds atpCap
[1:04:40] <Tucker0603> @c_game_me_811 the only skin I use for my Waifu now
[1:04:41] <+Ace_Flibble> @fuqboislim it's called factious exaggeration to stress the point.
[1:04:44] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @gatorafan
[1:04:44] <Phosphorescence_King> Needs skeleton wheels.
[1:04:49] <+Nomicro4u> Different cultures
[1:04:50] <prime_name> I'm done?
[1:04:55] <+Okosisi89> Is DOA just virtua fighter + tits?
[1:04:58] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @gatorafan we need them as Character outfits tho
[1:05:07] <+Nomicro4u> Besides the fact that these are imaginary people with super human powers
[1:05:17] <@Squdnate> DoA is dumbed down VF + Waifu bait
[1:05:17] <thepiefoot> @Okosisi89 DOA=BAD VF
[1:05:21] <%MightyMaxT> @Okosisi89 It's like Hyper Virtua Fighter, like Marvel is Hyper Streetfighter
[1:05:26] <+Okosisi89> That's what I thought ;_;
[1:05:33] <originalvizion> Well DoA first started out as VF with tits but it later on evolved
[1:05:33] <coreybom> @narcissistcactus Not that extent where they're saying "owey ow ow"
[1:05:36] <%FuqBoiSlim> even that angle is kinda of sus. there are tons of high school girls that act silly like that. usually on purpose or that's just how they are.
[1:05:37] <outerenoshima> i do find it funny that Marie the flattest character is the most popular DoA character
[1:05:39] <%Solidnick18> brad wong has the drunken style
[1:05:41] <%Irridium> brad wong fucks me up
[1:05:48] <C_game_me_811> @tucker0603 Good taste SeemsGood
[1:05:54] <+Ace_Flibble> @okosisi89 That's how it first started, but then it also added big stage interaction, more floor/wall bouncing, the counter hold system, etc..
[1:05:56] <originalvizion> DoA is more like a stylish VF
[1:06:06] <Kalinflip> DOa is like a lmaer tekken then
[1:06:07] <%gatorafan> In another time,. I'm sure the people behind this game would have found a way to make a Skeleton have jiggle physics.
[1:06:11] <originalvizion> VF is bland but the combat is amazing
[1:06:11] <Kalinflip> Lamer* NotLikeThis
[1:06:17] <%gatorafan> We've been past that time apparently.
[1:06:21] <+DarkNerdShawny> Doa is a faster, less realistic, ninja, version of VF. both are great
[1:06:33] <%MightyMaxT> Controversial opinion, I like how DOA feels more than Tekken
[1:06:34] <originalvizion> well DoA gameplay is different from Tekken
[1:06:34] <Guntanks_in_Space> DOA started as floatier wackier VF, but yea it developed into its own thing
[1:06:35] <Tucker0603> @c_game_me_811 I mean my female barbarian in D3 is called Waifu cause I'm a knucklehead like that
[1:06:43] <C_game_me_811> brad wong is the shun di of this game
[1:06:43] <Goraka91> Clearly the only good fighting game is Soul Calibur Kappa
[1:06:43] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:06:46] <+MobiusIII> @Guntanks_in_Space Hopefully they bring back Virtua Fighter characters.
[1:06:47] <+DarkNerdShawny> DOA is better than Tekken
[1:06:54] <+Nomicro4u> DOA is more counter heavy
[1:07:02] <Guntanks_in_Space> hell, just bring back VF outside of Yakuza bonuses even
[1:07:05] <outerenoshima> this training mode is Kreygasm
[1:07:10] <+Okosisi89> @Goraka91 Clearly a man of good sense and quality taste.
[1:07:17] <Tucker0603> @c_game_me_811 also I got the "special" Zarya mousepad
[1:07:20] <%FuqBoiSlim> whens Arcana Heart III Love max @Woolie
[1:07:20] <originalvizion> I prefer DoA but Tekken is cool
[1:07:22] <Guntanks_in_Space> @Goraka91 good man
[1:07:23] <Phosphorescence_King> Yo, who all's going to EVO next week?
[1:07:32] <%FuqBoiSlim> oh fuck oh god
[1:07:39] <Guntanks_in_Space> what was the special zarya mousepad anyway? the wrist rest is her flexed bicep?
[1:07:40] <@Squdnate> sbfpDattebayo @DarkNerdShawny
[1:07:54] <Goraka91> Nightmare is the raddest fighting game character change my mind
[1:08:00] <%MightyMaxT> Wait...EVO is NEXT WEEK?! I thought it was end of August for some reason.
[1:08:05] <+DarkNerdShawny> DOA > Tekken. Cant change my mind lol
[1:08:06] <FR3nCH_T0aST> In this game you will want to get a bounce to guarantee your super hits :) I think Diego has a bounce if you hit 7k 75
[1:08:06] <C_game_me_811> @tucker0603 Nice :D we need More female barbarians in video games
[1:08:08] <Guntanks_in_Space> i think off launch you can do K,P, into 6R1
[1:08:10] <VJdarkworld> :O
[1:08:18] <Tucker0603> @guntanks_in_space yep
[1:08:18] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> So whos the guest?
[1:08:21] <%MightyMaxT> How am I going to decide between watching EVO and G1 Climax?
[1:08:28] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> can we get a !guest command?
[1:09:08] <Tucker0603> @c_game_me_811 accurate female barbarians that is, not the super models in steel bikinis
[1:09:10] <@Squdnate> @DarkNerdShawny I know that's you Itagaki, get out of here
[1:09:13] <originalvizion> Look all the data shown daamn
[1:09:15] <BalloniWright> sooo Evo will end earlier this year huh LUL
[1:09:22] <Guntanks_in_Space> you gotta do another launch off that
[1:09:26] <originalvizion> this training mode is freakin sick
[1:09:29] <Phosphorescence_King> Every character generally has juggles into a ground bounce that leads into a hard hit or a super.
[1:09:32] <Guntanks_in_Space> doing the same sequence again knocks the opponent down
[1:09:47] <+DarkNerdShawny> LUL idk who that is lol but DOA is my favorite 3d fighter tho @Squdnate
[1:09:54] <Guntanks_in_Space> there you go!
[1:09:57] <FR3nCH_T0aST> If you look at the life bar you can see how much damage you can do before your oppoennt just drops to the ground (it's the flashing part)
[1:10:02] <%gatorafan> DoA is one of the OG "I buy it for the gameplay, not the fanservice" games. And it still holds true (unlike most of the games on that category IMO).
[1:10:13] <@Squdnate> He's the creator of DoA. And he fucking HATES Tekken with a passion
[1:10:14] <Guntanks_in_Space> i thought Lord Oatmeal hates DOA nowadays since 5 lol
[1:10:16] <%FuqBoiSlim> The Oatmeal Man
[1:10:23] <originalvizion> Lool Itagaki
[1:10:25] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> DOA is the Samurai Shodown of Virtua Fighter games
[1:10:32] <+DarkNerdShawny> @Squdnate A man with good taste lol
[1:10:36] <+Okosisi89> What does that even mean?
[1:10:39] <Guntanks_in_Space> also he hates tekken with a passion as a "friendly" rivalry with Harada lol
[1:11:01] <Goraka91> Harada sure is an interesting fellow
[1:11:01] <+NarcissistCactus> can't be a rivalry when there's no competition atpCap
[1:11:04] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> it means some people don't think it be like it is but it do
[1:11:05] <%gatorafan> I'm sure that by friendly rivalry he means something like the Majima Everywhere system.
[1:11:15] <%flarebears> flarebears subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:11:20] <Phosphorescence_King> When you cancel the super, it lets the opponent break hold.
[1:11:30] <Guntanks_in_Space> they were once college schoolmates at some point iirc. that and way way back Lord Oatmeal, Harada, and Yu Suzuki drank in the same bar bantering about their respective 3D fighters
[1:11:37] <FR3nCH_T0aST> Just spam 1pp for Diego's low, woolie :v
[1:11:39] <+ducethegamer> all fighting game dev's are pretty buddy buddy with each other
[1:11:41] <+Ace_Flibble> Harada likes DOA, though. It's all in Itagaki's head
[1:11:41] <+chrishnaw> Bring back Itagaki! Make DOA Great Again!
[1:11:59] <@Menitta> I wonder what Itagaki thinks about Pokken
[1:12:13] <+DarkNerdShawny> best tactic.....down punch! down punch! down punch! down punch! down punch! down punch!.....dammit this isnt VF!
[1:12:16] <@Squdnate> Itagaki is too busy working on Devil's Third 2
[1:12:16] <%FuqBoiSlim> so harada lives rent free inside itagaki's head? that's tuff
[1:12:25] <Guntanks_in_Space> Devils Sixth
[1:12:26] <@Menitta> Devil's Fourth
[1:12:34] <originalvizion> Lmao Devil's turd
[1:12:38] <Guntanks_in_Space> CONDOR DIVE
[1:12:46] <%FuqBoiSlim> Devil's 3/5ths soon
[1:12:48] <+Ace_Flibble> Itagaki also says DOA5&6 are racist for making Lisa more explicitly Mexican, so, he's crazy.
[1:12:50] <FR3nCH_T0aST> Not all running attacks can be done from regular standing, though
[1:12:57] <FR3nCH_T0aST> Diego is just simple
[1:13:01] <Guntanks_in_Space> ^
[1:13:10] <originalvizion> Itagaki is a hack
[1:13:40] <Phosphorescence_King> I believe Diego's running tackle is not the same move as his 66P, but I could be wrong.
[1:13:49] <%FuqBoiSlim> Was she something else before? I know DOA characters cuz of the blender animations
[1:13:49] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:14:04] <%FuqBoiSlim> Idk their backstories
[1:14:11] <Guntanks_in_Space> it's the same move lol
[1:14:12] <T_Sasquatch> DO COMBO !
[1:14:12] <+DarkNerdShawny> @Ace_Flibble They made her skin more lighter than before, thats why he was mad.
[1:14:22] <originalvizion> DoA has nore depth now
[1:14:24] <FR3nCH_T0aST> @FuqBoiSlim what do you mean?
[1:14:28] <originalvizion> Also more balanced
[1:14:29] <@Squdnate> !drop
[1:14:29] <@Moobot> Woolie has forgot to drop the shield 5 times
[1:14:46] <originalvizion> After the guy left
[1:14:47] <@Menitta> we had !drop?
[1:14:55] <@Squdnate> Secret commands
[1:14:57] <%gatorafan> That command is not on the list daedra1DerpyTibs
[1:14:58] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> whatever happened to Itagaki Uchiha?
[1:15:00] <@Squdnate> :v
[1:15:08] <@Menitta> the secret moves
[1:15:10] <+DarkNerdShawny> Wait, what shield now? lol
[1:15:11] <%FuqBoiSlim> @fr3nch_t0ast he said doa was racist because they made her more Mexican. was she not Mexican before that?
[1:15:36] <%FuqBoiSlim> !drop
[1:15:36] <@Moobot> Woolie has forgot to drop the shield 6 times
[1:15:41] <originalvizion> Itagaki is mad because DoA got better when he left
[1:15:49] <originalvizion> So he talking shit
[1:15:59] <%FuqBoiSlim> @originalvizion tale as old as time. ya hate to see it tho
[1:16:02] <+DarkNerdShawny> Exactly. Shes been mexican lol they made her skin lighter, thats why he was ma
[1:16:02] <@Squdnate> Itagaki is crazy
[1:16:34] <originalvizion> He was always talking shit about other games
[1:16:39] <C_game_me_811> @darknerdshawny Yeah they did I Wish they kept it the same
[1:16:42] <%FuqBoiSlim> @darknerdshawny oh I see, I thought they retconned her nationality or something lol
[1:17:20] <Hoarseplay> Lisa looked awful before. Like someone covered her in body paint.
[1:17:23] <Phosphorescence_King> Backturn moves are different from normal moves. Diego's backturn launcher should be P+K.
[1:17:29] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Itagaki would have made the Greatest Hokage
[1:17:30] <@Squdnate> He loves to talk shit, even when he hasn't made a single game since 2015, which was a failed 3DS game
[1:17:40] <%FuqBoiSlim> F?
[1:17:43] <originalvizion> True talk Hoarseplay

[1:19:26] <bottomglasscinema> God speed with this game.
[1:19:30] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Is the Online Versus Dead or Alive?

[1:24:00] <Deathzone775> Whooo my monkey brain saw Woolie streaming DOA I had to click
[1:24:19] <seycheles> pat woolie and paige is such a powerful trio
[1:24:24] <keiji_maede> @wirblewomble That's alot of fuckers mine friend
[1:24:40] <PlainSimpleTailor> Has Woolie given up on Ace Combat for the short term?
[1:24:53] <GeltonZ> This game makes me so sad. DOA5 was SO GOOD and then this comes along and is just...DOA5 minus 75% of the content.
[1:24:58] <jonathandemel> So is this guy supposed to look like Travis Touchdown?
[1:25:00] <Guntanks_in_Space> certain characters can force back turn i think
[1:25:04] <Guntanks_in_Space> like Hitomi PPK string
[1:25:16] <+Nomicro4u> ONLY $200
[1:25:20] <bonzosan> Ayane is backturn queen
[1:25:21] <Phosphorescence_King> Lots of characters have throws that force backturn
[1:25:27] <%gatorafan> I don't think Ace Combat was supposed to be a series. Maybe he'll give a try on his own at one point.
[1:25:28] <FR3nCH_T0aST> @GeltonZ maybe doa5 last round minus 75% content, but doa5 vanilla?
[1:25:33] <Goraka91> Gotta buy the bride outfits though
[1:25:43] <Guntanks_in_Space> @Phosphorescence_King i remember in early DOA6 Nico having some really, really wacky shit with not cancelling her throw chain
[1:25:47] <%Irridium> @WoolieVersus what about the 8 season passes for 5 at $93 each?
[1:25:50] <%Gogogolem> Gogogolem subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 8 month streak! Hey Woolie, its that time again , Coffee has a rough time in our house. It gets mugged every single morning!
[1:25:53] <+Nomicro4u> Real talk can we see all the Bride outfits and how much they cost?
[1:25:55] <%FuqBoiSlim> My string bikinis though
[1:25:58] <GeltonZ> @FR3nCH_T0aST Right I meant Last Round. It's only missing 20% of the content compared to Vanilla.
[1:25:58] <+DarkNerdShawny> Beach clothes just came out not too long ago. Get them while theyre.......hot Kappa
[1:26:16] <Phosphorescence_King> @Guntanks_in_Space NotLikeThis
[1:26:32] <originalvizion> GeltonZ Its stupid to compare a vanilla to a GOTY
[1:26:32] <GeltonZ> I'd get the beach clothes if I could buy them individually like in DOA5, but nope! Packs only for DOA6...unless you play on XBone?
[1:26:34] <%jinking79> @WoolieVersus simple just google search that Stand on the jojo wiki if u want. The Stand has no spoilers for any Jojo Parts, ppl rarely talk about it and goddamn it has that many users
[1:26:36] <FR3nCH_T0aST> "Diego doesn't have good lows" wut :v
[1:26:42] <Guntanks_in_Space> you either force backturn, or let go of the throw chain for BIG ADVANTAGE
[1:26:52] <Deathzone775> this game still have a community on PC ? I bought on release and played for a little bit
[1:26:59] <Guntanks_in_Space> really dumb big advantage even
[1:27:04] <+DarkNerdShawny> My tactic....ALWAYS. BE. BLOCKING!
[1:27:15] <Cure_Optimism> This series got dragged through the mud and now everyone thinks it's a fucktoy game
[1:27:27] <Phosphorescence_King> "You can't be wrong if you refuse to guess"
[1:27:40] <GeltonZ> @originalvizion Except that this is BUILT off of DOA5. It's the same damn game with the same damn combos and the same damn everything except new models and running on the damn Dynasty Warriors 9 engine and thrown together in less than a year with a scammier DLC scheme.
[1:27:41] <FR3nCH_T0aST> @Deathzone775 there's always people on on peak hours, outside of peak hours finding a match can take a while
[1:27:42] <Goraka91> @Cure_Optimism I mean it works...
[1:28:03] <C_game_me_811> @geltonz Agree and the new soul caliber seem to have a majority of recycled content even though both games are good :(
[1:28:03] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:28:06] <GeltonZ> @originalvizion And vanilla DOA5 still had more content.
[1:28:14] <Goraka91> @GeltonZ Even has the EXACT SAME outfits as DLC
[1:28:14] <TheBrunoZone> @Goraka91 Unfortunately...
[1:28:17] <Deathzone775> @cure_optimism they did it to themselves
[1:28:22] <GiveMoneyToVolta> DOA 7 needs doritos lootboxes
[1:28:28] <Deathzone775> @fr3nch_t0ast thanks
[1:28:31] <GeltonZ> @C_game_me_811 Oh yeah, SC6 is a downgrade of a downgrade. It's actually still using SC4 character models just with new faces.
[1:28:43] <C_game_me_811> @geltonz Same :(
[1:28:44] <Smart_ZaK1> They aren't lootboxes, they are minibuys
[1:28:52] <Cure_Optimism> All I'm saying is this game is more than the jiggle physics.
[1:29:00] <originalvizion> @geltonz DoA6 is not built off DoA5 wtf are u talking about they had to recreate everything
[1:29:02] <GiveMoneyToVolta> They are not lootboxes, they are fun mechanics
[1:29:04] <%gatorafan> We've moved past lootboxes, this is the era of surprise mechanics (which are quite ethical).
[1:29:10] <FR3nCH_T0aST> *Didn't check the half circle throw with insane range and damage*
[1:29:10] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> What is this? Woolie VS Competence? KappaHD
[1:29:13] <Goraka91> Yeah SC6 is straight up 4, noticed that with some of the customisation options
[1:29:20] <Deathzone775> no for sure but it doesnt help that the company puts that at the forefront
[1:29:20] <Ion_Laser> @gatorafan And fun!
[1:29:24] <@Menitta> thats very weird
[1:29:27] <GeltonZ> @originalvizion No they recreated the graphics. The game engine is the same as DOA5.
[1:29:34] <+Papafleish> surprise! The costumes cost 200 dollars!
[1:29:42] <Smart_ZaK1> oof
[1:29:44] <@Menitta> That is TERRIBLE YOU SHOULD FEEL BAD
[1:29:46] <%FuqBoiSlim> ugh
[1:29:46] <%SirGO0SE> WOW
[1:29:52] <originalvizion> @geltonz DoA6 has a brand new engine which TN said thats its a pain in the ass to work with
[1:29:53] <+DarkNerdShawny> i see what he did there lol

[2:26:57] <%DarkNerdShawny> Eliot.....TRASH
[2:26:57] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Is it racist to say "WHERE ISSS JA???!?"
[2:26:59] <sperium3000> The kung-fu noises are called "kiai". They're a part of every martial art, basically
[2:27:12] <%Admiral_PopnFresh> I'd mention that there are plenty of people who know the homages to Bruce Lee without knowing about Bruce Lee himself, and in that context, it CAN be racist
[2:27:13] <sperium3000> Also boxing, though less so.
[2:27:17] <%DarkNerdShawny> 2 bar wifi combo...by the way!
[2:27:25] <%Irridium> :(

[2:27:37] <thepiefoot> @sperium3000 I got that taught when i went to Karate classes
[2:27:42] <sperium3000> I don't know the pratical reasoning behind it, but it's something about the breathing?
[2:27:52] <Guntanks_in_Space> not a electric, but god shoulder is a JF input
[2:27:53] <majima666> electric wind jiggle fist
[2:27:59] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> What does Ja Rule think about these matchups
[2:28:04] <Smart_ZaK1> How would you even react to a wakeup that fast???
[2:28:11] <sperium3000> I know that when I did boxing, I would blow a bit of air through my teeth with every punch and that would help me keep my flow going
[2:28:14] <%Irridium> wait was I on wireless?
[2:28:17] <%Rezca> I miss Shota Elliot

[2:38:37] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:38:38] <prime_name> Wha?
[2:38:48] <Goraka91> FeelsBadMan
[2:38:49] <DatAsuna> pour one out for FnF
[2:38:50] <Ion_Laser> It's All About the Money
[2:38:54] <@Menitta> Oh yeah the DOA5 FNF was wack
[2:39:05] <thepiefoot> F for FNF and Excellent Adventures
[2:39:06] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah DOA5 FNF was roooough
[2:39:12] <GeltonZ> @WoolieVersus The DOA5 problem was because of the 360's shit patching system. All the updates were in the Costume Catalogues.
[2:39:13] <D1noMyke> thats a sick tshirt
[2:39:17] <%SirGO0SE> and you bet its worth it
[2:39:17] <C_game_me_811> @goraka91 I don’t know if it’s hundred percent true but people are saying it is
[2:39:23] <+BubbaRands> Dammit Woolie I'm already drunk, I don't need these feel RN NotLikeThis
[2:39:24] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> you mean EGRIGIOUS
[2:39:24] <%GunterDriger6> Dem costumes woolieOMG
[2:39:26] <%ChoculaUltra> and the F is for Finisher
[2:39:28] <%DarkNerdShawny> Thats because it was DOA5U they fixed it in DOA5 LR
[2:39:31] <D1noMyke> also kirby
[2:39:33] <PumpkinSong> at least it's easy now since you need to buy them in packs Kappa
[2:39:36] <GeltonZ> @WoolieVersus New stages and character data was in the Costume Catalogues, that's why you needed to do that.
[2:39:41] <%FuqBoiSlim> that shits EGREGIOUS
[2:39:43] <DracaenaLeaf> DOA5 was fun
[2:39:45] <Guntanks_in_Space> DOA5 is also equally rock-solid
[2:39:54] <GeltonZ> @WoolieVersus You didn't have to do that on PS3. DOA5 had WAAAY more respectful DLC than DOA6.
[2:39:55] <Guntanks_in_Space> a lot of my early youtube uploads were matches i played of this
[2:39:58] <Guntanks_in_Space> err, 5 lol
[2:40:05] <%DarkNerdShawny> 5 is better than 6 tbh
[2:40:13] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Jesus didn't die for Lootboxes
[2:40:15] <%DarkNerdShawny> 5 Last round any way
[2:40:21] <%SirGO0SE> DO THEY WOOLIE?! because I SEE A LESS HONKERS OPTION in that menu
[2:40:25] <C_game_me_811> @dracaenaleaf @guntanks_in_space DOA 5 ultimate Kreygasm
[2:40:32] <GeltonZ> @WoolieVersus The problem you had with DOA5 was ENTIRELY because of Microsoft's shit patching system. Those Costume Catalogues had all the patch data in it.
[2:40:38] <DracaenaLeaf> Nice
[2:40:45] <Guntanks_in_Space> LR was my lifeblood at some point. constant players, Rachel just stomping motherfuckers, and so on
[2:40:51] <+BubbaRands> DOA extreme 4 coming sooooooon Kreygasm
[2:40:51] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> is DOA DLC a surprise mechanic?
[2:40:52] <Goraka91> Wait what
[2:40:53] <thepiefoot> How is the modding scene? Do people have legitimate reasons to buy 120$ of dlc ?
[2:40:53] <%DarkNerdShawny> The new bikini set is out for like $35 smh
[2:41:01] <%Rezca> I miss the original Xtreme soundtrack
[2:41:14] <+TruSpindash> Age 99 Kreygasm
[2:41:16] <%SirGO0SE> now you just release "oops all girls" version
[2:41:16] <%DarkNerdShawny> Reggie just wanted volley ball.....riiiiiiiiiiiight Kappa
[2:41:17] <%GunterDriger6> LUL LUL LUL
[2:41:19] <PumpkinSong> it came out on Steam in select countries and beat out DOA6 by the thousands
[2:41:27] <Love_Struck_> lies
[2:41:29] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> You still gotta get into the mud and enjoy the DOA
[2:41:31] <Ion_Laser> Yes the volleyballs...I mean ball!
[2:41:34] <IShadowStrykerI> honestly DoA DLC is bad its nowhere near the worst...i will never understand how people can defend SMITE
[2:41:34] <%DarkNerdShawny> What we playing now?
[2:41:40] <+BubbaRands> You play DOA EXTREME for the VOLLEYBALL?!?! DansGame
[2:41:43] <CalderGaming> ooo a game I've never heard of
[2:41:44] <C_game_me_811> I like 6 but it’s lacking in content :(
[2:41:48] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Arcus Chroma?
[2:41:52] <GeltonZ> @WoolieVersus The problem you had with DOA5 was because of Microsoft's shit patching system. All the patch data was in those Costume Catalogues. PS3 did not have that issue.
[2:41:52] <%DarkNerdShawny> nani?
[2:41:53] <thepiefoot> Uncharted territory ?!? PogChamp
[2:41:53] <@Menitta> Ok I have seen this game at cons all the time but never bought it
[2:42:18] <Guntanks_in_Space> woolz when's UFDK2
[2:42:21] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> No, no footage
[2:42:25] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> just game
[2:42:29] <C_game_me_811> The one with all The crappy characters no thanks DansGame DansGame DansGame
[2:42:43] <%DarkNerdShawny> The PS4 did not have that issue either
[2:43:00] <GeltonZ> @WoolieVersus Yeah, 360 stores patches in its CACHE so 360 patches can only be 20MB so not enough space for Characters and Stages.
[2:43:02] <koolaid_kevster> @WoolieVersus you lied DOA xtreme 3 does have vollyball justy alotta other lewd stuff just saw trailer
[2:43:07] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Xbox making my Micro-Hard
[2:43:12] <C_game_me_811> @geltonz Ouch that sucks :(
[2:43:33] <GeltonZ> @C_game_me_811 Yup, but Team Ninja was clever and worked around it. Honestly that shit is why so much On Disc DLC happened.
[2:43:35] <%Rezca> Why is no one talking about Xtreme Venus Vacation
[2:43:43] <C_game_me_811> @geltonz I hated doing that DansGame
[2:43:43] <CalderGaming> oh i remember this
[2:43:44] <koolaid_kevster> yeah you did a vid on it that game is sick

[3:13:59] <GeltonZ> @WoolieVersus While you're reading chat, I know this is stupid but did you get any of my messages about the Punch Girl in Crash Team Racing?

[3:15:16] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> testing
[3:15:24] <GeltonZ> XD Okay good.
[3:15:46] <%HitmanBillson> that healing is mad sustain for a 1v1 game
[3:15:52] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Why would Woolie care about a girl character who's drinking punch?
[3:15:54] <%hatesdps> @GxGrainSon is the sparky build out yet?
[3:15:55] <GeltonZ> Yeah I might maybe have been obsessing over those obscure non-characters for 20 years now and their graduation to full fledged characters is a big deal to me.
[3:16:08] <joeyjojo70> Just got here, that doesn't look like DoA6...wah they playing?
[3:16:20] <g15835> @gxgrainson yoooo, the slick pixels. this would be so sick to get a Switch port...

[3:16:32] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Category is still DO6
[3:16:36] <TheBrunoZone> @Menitta Nope
[3:16:41] <GeltonZ> I don't think this game HAS a category since it's a WIP indie game
[3:16:50] <%HitmanBillson> still says DOA6 for me
[3:16:52] <@Menitta> !game Arcus Chroma
[3:16:53] <@Moobot> The category was set to "Arcus"
[3:16:53] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> totally still DOA on category I just refreshed

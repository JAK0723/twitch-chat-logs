[0:16:24] <@SoushinSen> Age is just a mathematical equation.
[0:16:24] <+DesertPenguin> Age is physical. Maturity is not
[0:16:29] <@Solidus_113> Adults don't actually exist. Everyone is just kids at varying stages of giving up

[0:18:26] <stachystat> May also be a part of people sharing their personal lives in ways they didn't before, so you see more of the silly stuff adults do.

[0:58:32] <Shraquet> Is Woolie playing on hard mode?
[0:58:40] <rearedlogarithm> I don’t actually know if the 0-2 grenades do damage. I think they just make the BTs flee for a time.
[0:58:40] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:58:42] <QaizerArt> yeah when you get the bike you can just go like 'BYE BITCH'
[0:58:50] <@Solidus_113> you can still accidentally run into a BT and it'll grab your bike
[0:58:54] <%Ecchigun> @shraquet theres a hard mode?
[0:59:03] <+tuchpi> yes
[0:59:04] <Angry_Ev1L> pff we'll see how well it'll go
[0:59:05] <Shraquet> @ecchigun There is.
[0:59:06] <StarlitStunner> They can go super far too, probably the longer potential grenade tosses for a video game

[1:02:42] <gunsrlove> that bike should be dragging and falling down every 2 seconds
[1:02:42] <Graxe_> BTs almost caught up to Sam in the opening, though
[1:02:46] <damienlunas> Woolie stay on the path
[1:03:01] <DedlokPM> @Menitta it is a Kojima game. most of the story sense will probably make sense no matter the order you see them. May still want to avoid the ending though but woolie is far from the end.
[1:03:02] <stachystat> wonder how well this game'll hold up when there are less people playing and building bridges and stuff
[1:03:02] <wanocountry> !Uptime

[1:06:52] <GoldeNOVA> What birthday stuff?
[1:06:59] <+Mkingston> Birthday Mads
[1:07:01] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> he got his Mads cutscene
[1:07:02] <tanngnj0str> DO NOT TAKE THE LEFT ROUTE
[1:07:04] <@Solidus_113> There's a secret prepper close by
[1:07:06] <DedlokPM> @jinking79 he got a birthday message from Madds, but I dunno if he noticed the cake
[1:07:08] <marvel877> of course this game came out a full month after my own birthday.
[1:07:16] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @tanngnj0str
[1:08:09] <peachy996> Vehicle Traversal in this game reminds me of Mass Effect 1
[1:08:14] <+Mkingston> Cannot wait for the larger text patch next week.
[1:08:22] <Doomstar16> Fun adventures
[1:08:37] <@Menitta> @peachy996 is that good or bad lol

[1:09:19] <QaizerArt> I made it like halfway before mine blew up
[1:09:43] <+Mkingston> Got my first Game Over today in Chapter 4.
[1:09:44] <@Solidus_113> drop a pcc and repair spray
[1:09:46] <+tuchpi> LUL
[1:10:30] <katocrimson> look out ffor other players signs. They are quite helpful
[1:10:42] <%TopLeftCenter> wheelie + bunny hop + turbo can accomplish anything, but trying for the first time with BTs on top of you might (will) go terribly

[1:18:40] <+Mkingston> @RAAAAAINMAKER thanks
[1:19:01] <+berserkscarlett> That Kirby apparel is sick
[1:19:02] <GarbageNirvana> That's prime EX grenadin'
[1:19:09] <+Stupid121v2> yeyeye short breaths
[1:19:20] <Infinit_Phoenix> woolies going real pat with his item usage
[1:19:59] <+Mkingston> It's fascinating how polar opposite Pat and Woolie are when it comes to playing this game.
[1:20:00] <+linSP> i got a 24 pack of monster the day this game came out last month, getting another 24 tonight yeye
[1:20:00] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:20:05] <damienlunas> This game kind of feels like if Breath of the Wild was just climbing, and that's really okay with me.
[1:20:31] <+tuchpi> that's not even close
[1:20:36] <Graxe_> That looks like prime bloodvertizing targets
[1:20:45] <HeroSolaire> meh, climbing of breath of the wild is poop
[1:21:03] <+Mkingston> @HeroSolaire Amen
[1:21:06] <$Swish19XX> Them boxes gettin' rusty
[1:21:20] <Djinnazz> it's ok, s long as he doesn't fall
[1:21:35] <+Cymen90> BLOOD DAMAGE
[1:21:48] <wanocountry> Fallen Order > this game tbh
[1:21:54] <DedlokPM> OTO TO
[1:22:00] <@Solidus_113> they're not even the same genre
[1:22:03] <+Cymen90> @wanocountry You have a right to your wrong opinions
[1:22:07] <wanocountry> Lel
[1:22:10] <Infinit_Phoenix> gotta drink that monster to produce MAX PISS CAPACITY
[1:22:13] <@Solidus_113> bad bait
[1:22:22] <derap41> !uptime
[1:22:22] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 22 minutes
[1:22:44] <mayorrev> @WoolieVersus you got repair spray?
[1:22:44] <wanocountry> They're both third person roaming game
[1:22:45] <peachy996> I await the days when Woolie is far enough where we can send him clips of Pat's blunders on stream
[1:22:47] <HeroSolaire> PT is better than Death Stranding tbh! 4Head
[1:22:47] <$Swish19XX> I hope Woolz figured out the triangle button
[1:22:48] <JoeNeutrino> Street Fighter > Kirby tbh
[1:22:51] <+Stupid121v2> goooood he noticed lol
[1:22:55] <mayorrev> he does!
[1:23:01] <Graxe_> Oh no, the sperm and eggs needs repairing
[1:23:02] <+tuchpi> @wanocountry nice bait Kappa
[1:23:09] <peachy996> But they're all mostly in spoiler territory
[1:23:17] <Daxalog> Sperm and eggs are leaking
[1:23:25] <+Mkingston> Why can't you wrap the cases in plastic sheets like you did with your mom's body?
[1:23:25] <@Solidus_113> It's less effective in the rain
[1:23:30] <NotHereToStream> deliver these eggs and sperm to save america sam
[1:23:34] <%GeneralSCPatton> Spray doesn't work good in rain
[1:23:42] <katocrimson> spray that soul glo
[1:23:42] <@Solidus_113> @Mkingston that's an unlock later
[1:23:42] <+linSP> the back of the box it says this is a new "strand"-genre, i feel kojima wants to make the next category of games like the "soulslike" term
[1:23:43] <peachy996> Sperm and Egss sounds like a gross sandwhich
[1:23:43] <Graxe_> Yeah, I'd expect that the spray does less in timefall
[1:23:53] <Graxe_> Because timefall is a constant DoT
[1:23:58] <+Stupid121v2> eh at least he noticed at the end pretty much
[1:24:01] <mayorrev> ohhh right that bag that pat got
[1:24:15] <$Swish19XX> I was so far into the game when I realized the timefall shelter has repair spray with it
[1:24:18] <mayorrev> i wondered what that was
[1:24:22] <GoldeNOVA> Climbing is pretty janky huh
[1:24:25] <NotHereToStream> nice
[1:24:27] <NiktenKing> It's just Flex Seal Spray
[1:24:30] <+PenmanLupine> even Reggie doesn't listen to Woolie
[1:24:30] <marvel877> Was AFK for a bit, he's still in the rocks?
[1:24:38] <+tuchpi> @GoldeNOVA no, he isn't pressing X enough LUL
[1:24:42] <+experimental_jet> Blame it on the rain!
[1:24:42] <+Stupid121v2> end of the rocks
[1:24:44] <%GeneralSCPatton> Literally, the rain washes it off before it can finish drying
[1:24:48] <%allups> slong
[1:24:59] <peachy996> Slong is a great term
[1:25:13] <%allups> agreed
[1:25:31] <@Solidus_113> you will right now
[1:25:58] <peachy996> Yes I love this song

[1:26:28] <+berserker_103> I tried pretty hard just to get the bike over the rocks

[1:26:33] <+Stupid121v2> hold triggers and gun it boys
[1:26:38] <GarbageNirvana> Ropes would be handy

[1:28:22] <yuribo26> Feet? Meters woolie, actual human terminology
[1:28:37] <stachystat> Good work Minh
[1:28:49] <+Cymen90> MUSIC RUINED
[1:28:52] <+Stupid121v2> arrange that shit lmao
[1:28:55] <HeroSolaire> triangle
[1:28:58] <marvel877> TRIANGLE
[1:29:01] <mayorrev> Music ruined more like Vod saved
[1:29:10] <mayorrev> <o/
[1:29:15] <NiktenKing> No Woolz on Wooloo petting action
[1:29:16] <+Mkingston> It's all like Iceland. Because Kojima visited Iceland. That's where he discovered Low Roar.
[1:29:17] <+tuchpi> ??? LUL
[1:29:27] <+Stupid121v2> one day the triangle will be pressed
[1:29:30] <+Cymen90> MUSIC DROP RUINED
[1:29:38] <peachy996> Its a good drop
[1:29:39] <mayorrev> oh yeah thbe drums kick in
[1:29:42] <marvel877> Is he still not aware of the Auto Arrange Cargo button?
[1:29:45] <reiju_22> SourPls
[1:29:47] <+Stupid121v2> nah he know
[1:29:48] <Garrison27> What the fuck did I come in on?
[1:29:49] <$Swish19XX> Oh shit he did it!?
[1:29:51] <Djinnazz> he knows
[1:29:54] <mayorrev> gotta hold it down thw hole time
[1:29:56] <mayorrev> lmao
[1:30:01] <@Solidus_113> you can press triangle to put it on your back
[1:30:05] <NiktenKing> You can also chuck stuff at enemies
[1:30:06] <%GeneralSCPatton> Seriously, use auto-arrange
[1:30:15] <Graxe_> Port Knot
[1:30:21] <+Mkingston> Imagine PS5 resistant triggers when carrying a heavy package.
[1:30:22] <mayorrev> i assume he's holding it so he doesnt tip over as much
[1:30:22] <JoeNeutrino> auto-arrange is kinda good
[1:30:23] <+VantomPayne> whats the lyric around this part?
[1:30:26] <mrfreezepunsbestpuns> Auto arange is for cowards
[1:30:31] <Infinit_Phoenix> has woolie managed to collect a cryptobiote or has he still scared them all away?
[1:30:31] <$Swish19XX> Looks like he just auto-arranged, no?
[1:30:49] <WhereIsWill> he literally just auto arranged guys
[1:30:52] <peachy996> @VantomPayne Bring your friends bring it all up, ohh don't suck it up
[1:30:57] <%rytyoung> You can tackle!
[1:31:01] <GarbageNirvana> I can't honestly say I've seen any part of America that looks like this
[1:31:02] <mayorrev> What's billy gonna put over this
[1:31:13] <mayorrev> I hope he puts something silly like Banana Phone
[1:31:14] <GarbageNirvana> But then America also doesn't have a massive lake dividing it in the midwest
[1:31:25] <+Cymen90> Is he applying the Kojima approved "Pat Playstyle"?
[1:31:26] <peachy996> I was lookin at the lyricscouple days ago
[1:31:37] <Infinit_Phoenix> the problem is timefall and voidouts has massively changed terrain
[1:31:37] <NiktenKing> Montana has some places like that.... but who goes to Montana :T
[1:31:39] <+VantomPayne> first time i got to this part i was hyped by the music, sprinted down the hill and tripped
[1:31:52] <Djinnazz> my favorite is Trigger
[1:31:54] <$Swish19XX> I don't get why there isn't an ipod type thing in the game. It would of been great to throw some tunes on while doing deliveries
[1:31:59] <mayorrev> Seeing flat road is refreshing after doing some climbing
[1:32:02] <GarbageNirvana> All I know about Montana is Arby's named a sandwich after it
[1:32:03] <peachy996> A lot of Low Roar, a little of this band and Ludvig's great original score
[1:32:15] <+tuchpi> because he wants you to ehar the music at specific times
[1:32:19] <%rytyoung> There's a very strong leitmotif in death stranding, I won't say for spoilers sake
[1:32:20] <@Solidus_113> There's like 2 whole Low Roar albums in this
[1:32:20] <marvel877> @Swish19XX at best, it'll be a mod on PC
[1:32:21] <peachy996> Also Ludwig usage of synths is fantastic
[1:32:34] <StarlitStunner> Silent poets
[1:32:35] <damienlunas> I wish you could spike the package when you reach your destination
[1:32:36] <DedlokPM> @GarbageNirvana also america doesn't have time accelerating rain speeding up the growth of the plants and the erosion of the terrain
[1:32:39] <damienlunas> That would be even more American
[1:32:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> OH hes already in PK City? Im.....impressed LUL
[1:32:41] <+VantomPayne> @Swish19XX i wondered that too, i guess kojima doesnt want to ruin the scripted music sequences, tho i suppose you could always overwrite whatever is playing
[1:32:44] <@Menitta> I believe that the composer of any JRPG battle music should listen to it for 80 hours.
[1:32:46] <+berserker_103> took me so long before I saw that kirby onesie
[1:32:49] <+Mkingston> I wish Kojima had discovered Aurora.
[1:33:00] <KamiiFlow> orchestral mix for final boss
[1:33:02] <$Swish19XX> @marvel877 Kinda like how you could put whatever you want through the heli speakers in MGS5
[1:33:06] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> good job, your reward is a boss
[1:33:07] <DedlokPM> @berserker_103 woolieLORE wooliePOYO

[1:33:30] <damienlunas> Good work, help yourself to a sperm and egg sandwich
[1:33:41] <%rytyoung> Keep on keepin' on!
[1:33:42] <mayorrev> how many deliveries has woolie done so far btw
[1:33:51] <marvel877> @Swish19XX if i had bothered with the PC version instead of PS4, I'd have ACDC's Thunderstruck going nonstop.
[1:33:55] <Djinnazz> dunno, he played off camera
[1:34:01] <Sapphire_Breeze> LIKES GO UP
[1:34:06] <+Mkingston> @damienlunas the sperms act as floss

[1:34:47] <GarbageNirvana> Bout to get that rank up
[1:34:49] <peachy996> Intentionally done to make you feel cool about doing that Delivery
[1:34:51] <brunoberserk> big number

[1:51:56] <+ConLin_Arts_> has Woolie dieded to BTs yet?
[1:51:57] <+Mkingston> brb gotta bath my dog. That's not a euphemism.
[1:52:05] <masterfire23> @burdrightsactivist D:
[1:52:20] <$Swish19XX> I never even saw a voidout in my playthrough
[1:52:21] <peachy996> Sometimes I miss playing MGS4
[1:52:21] <+Stupid121v2> maybe keep a grenade maybe
[1:52:22] <+spheelman> DoritosChip
[1:52:30] <nepwar> @Mkingston damn that reminds me to wash my dog
[1:52:33] <@Solidus_113> 1 set of grenades is not enough to kill a BT, as you know
[1:52:35] <peachy996> Then I remember Acts 3 and 5 and I don't wanna
[1:52:36] <+ConLin_Arts_> I got voided out in the Wind Farm forest
[1:52:47] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> No wwoolie hasn't voided out yet, he has fucked around off stream with the bt whales though
[1:52:48] <BurdRightsActivist> @Solidus_113 Nah, not the big ones
[1:52:59] <%sovayell> rip those trees conlin
[1:53:03] <peachy996> And they're good acts for the most part its just cutscene to gameplay is too skewed
[1:53:03] <+Mkingston> I'm on Chapter 5. Yet to get a voidout.
[1:53:05] <+ConLin_Arts_> I need to replay MGS4, even with its faults I have fond memories of it
[1:53:06] <+paladinstarbuster> phew monkaS
[1:53:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> I usually carry 3 or 4 sets of hematic nades, until I get better stuff
[1:53:14] <+Stupid121v2> I never voided out, but came close
[1:53:15] <@Solidus_113> I beat the game without getting one
[1:53:31] <peachy996> @ConLin_Arts_ True going back to Shadow Moses and Best is Yet To Come is amazing moment
[1:53:32] <VidulaSaix> Both of mine were mistakes
[1:53:34] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> I voided out the forrest, honestly that was a net gain
[1:53:37] <+Cymen90> Should have recycled more weapons. Unneeded weight :)

[2:06:24] <serpenttucker> @WoolieVersus You can call to NPC's and player structures by pressing the touchpad on the controller. It will also summon those ghosts from the goop

[2:08:28] <%chronoxgp> throw sperm at him
[2:08:29] <+dementedcactus> Throw the grenade then pee thorugh the read mist for more damaging pee
[2:08:40] <+Cymen90> The game is giving him EXTRA DAMAGE so it is over faster LUL
[2:08:42] <+theAncopro> i think that's normal that if you throw blood at the same spot it starts doing more damage
[2:08:47] <%GeneralSCPatton> @dementedcactus Is that real?

[2:15:31] <Explodincatz> false
[2:15:32] <Lamedhos> WTF I just noticed what woolie is wearing
[2:15:34] <+Cymen90> Make new ones, recycle trash @WoolieVersus
[2:15:35] <%TubeMan642> you can not
[2:15:36] <+primax104> Only containers can be repaired
[2:15:41] <+dementedcactus> Wait that doesn't sound right
[2:15:49] <+experimental_jet> 2 types of damage
[2:15:58] <zenith0111> Kirby Onsies :o
[2:16:01] <+tuchpi> can't read LUL
[2:16:04] <+primax104> he will learn
[2:16:11] <+Tearonex> Alright, someone needs to tell woolie he can make boots,
[2:16:18] <+Stupid121v2> all good, just make new ones when you can
[2:16:18] <%TopLeftCenter> When they're not on your feet or the boot clip they're in a box, and you can repair the box
[2:16:20] <%GeneralSCPatton> Woolie's Stand spontaneously generates misconceptions out of thin air
[2:16:22] <+Tearonex> there we go
[2:16:24] <+theAncopro> very cheap
[2:16:27] <caja_de_ojos> 3 boots
[2:16:29] <NiktenKing> Hi Minh
[2:16:34] <+Stupid121v2> 40 boots
[2:16:42] <@SoushinSen> hi
[2:16:51] <DedlokPM> Imagine being someone telling someone to end a conversation and then continuing the conversation anyway in whispers. rooThink
[2:16:53] <+primax104> nah, it's just the learning process.
[2:17:07] <+experimental_jet> Was this the work of a Strand?
[2:17:07] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:17:24] <+linSP> fill up completely on boots and become bootman
[2:17:34] <+theAncopro> yup
[2:17:42] <wanocountry> !Uptime
[2:17:42] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 17 minutes
[2:17:45] <Lamedhos> don't be Pat
[2:18:08] <+thecosmicfly> Das-Bootman
[2:18:11] <Mendin> Keep em
[2:18:16] <shameimarusen> keep them
[2:18:17] <+paladinstarbuster> Keep em
[2:18:18] <peachy996> Woolie leaves a trail of litter across America
[2:18:18] <%GeneralSCPatton> Keep them
[2:18:19] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> no, recycle the empty blood bags though
[2:18:22] <+theAncopro> only if you have none in afacility, and you try to fabricate something
[2:18:27] <+Stupid121v2> you donate them to centers you decide to fabricate at, otherwise they on you all the time
[2:18:29] <$Swish19XX> I think you keep them in a vial that doesn't weigh anything
[2:18:51] <+tuchpi> 4 ladders LUL
[2:19:08] <+bread_assassin> Is there any point to recycling Chiral Crystals? They don't take up cargo space. Do you lose them when you die or something?
[2:19:13] <+primax104> Gun Jumping is the best tradition
[2:19:14] <peachy996> You never know when you need 4 ladders
[2:19:23] <+experimental_jet> To fabricate
[2:19:31] <+experimental_jet> Need them crystals
[2:19:39] <peachy996> What if you run into the Hardy Boyz?
[2:19:46] <heroicspiritavenger> Oh good, with 4 ladders Woolie can fall off of mountains 4 times
[2:19:49] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> blood bags don't auto refill, recycle the bags
[2:20:19] <+paladinstarbuster> Happy birthday Woolz
[2:20:21] <+PenmanLupine> you get new bags when you go to the rest room right?
[2:20:24] <+Stupid121v2> you get new blood bags on rest and can make more
[2:20:25] <+theAncopro> you gotta make new ones
[2:20:33] <+primax104> @heroicspiritavenger now that would be KWALITY KAHNTENT
[2:20:46] <+Stupid121v2> fabricate blood
[2:20:52] <katocrimson> u can also check share locker maybe u can get freebies
[2:20:53] <$Swish19XX> You can fabricate new ones too I believe
[2:20:55] <+tuchpi> reusing bloodbags WutFace

[2:23:16] <+tuchpi> auto-arrange does it
[2:23:27] <%GeneralSCPatton> USE TRIANGLE TO AUTO-ARRANGE
[2:23:46] <@SoushinSen> i hate auto-arrange, actually
[2:23:54] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> look at this boat ready load out
[2:24:09] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Woolie OCD
[2:24:10] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:24:14] <JoeNeutrino> Sorry, only chirality here
[2:24:25] <$Swish19XX> Auto-arrange never did me wrong except for maybe pizza time
[2:24:32] <+linSP> its been proven symmetry is not optimal
[2:24:41] <@SoushinSen> Woolie, wear some boots.
[2:24:42] <shameimarusen> Zaku Woolo
[2:24:44] <+theAncopro> yea boat is progress
[2:25:05] <%TopLeftCenter> @WoolieVersus If you look down at your feet on the cargo screen you can see a circle showing your center of balance
[2:25:07] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Manifest Destiny homie, get on the boat
[2:25:20] <%ECRead> Dark Souls 2 technically
[2:25:20] <+Taglog7> TakeNRG
[2:25:35] <+Cymen90> @RAAAAAINMAKER BT are a metaphor for Native Americans, confirmed
[2:25:41] <%ECRead> boots broke as hell
[2:25:45] <+Stupid121v2> WHAT
[2:25:48] <JoeNeutrino> I never noticed that
[2:25:49] <%chronoxgp> i never knew that
[2:25:52] <Swedish_Expert> wait what
[2:25:52] <+theAncopro> i actually had no idea
[2:25:53] <NotHereToStream> COM
[2:25:53] <$Swish19XX> I never fucking knew that lmao
[2:25:54] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> PogChamp
[2:25:54] <+Stupid121v2> I never saw that?
[2:25:55] <SolGoodguy> wow reggie
[2:25:56] <+tuchpi> ???
[2:25:57] <+Cymen90> All you scrubs played it WRONG
[2:25:59] <%sovayell> waow
[2:26:00] <SolGoodguy> the absolute madman
[2:26:00] <reiju_22> i never noticed that LUL
[2:26:01] <+Taglog7> Contropasta
[2:26:03] <+bread_assassin> WHAT. I never noticed that.
[2:26:05] <+primax104> Knowledge right here guys
[2:26:06] <Infinit_Phoenix> yeah it took me awhile to notice that
[2:26:06] <Mendin> The mechanics get even deeper
[2:26:09] <+theAncopro> SYSTEMS
[2:26:14] <+tuchpi> I don't think that ever matters
[2:26:20] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> @Cymen90 I didn't directly say that.... okay
[2:26:27] <katocrimson> 100 hrs and i didn't noe this
[2:26:28] <SolGoodguy> i hope woolie plays HL alyx
[2:26:31] <%chronoxgp> never understood why they had balancing mechanics on flat earth...
[2:26:32] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Walking sim, my ass. This has more mechanics than your usual generic game.
[2:26:34] <+paladinstarbuster> Think about how far you walked it makes sense that the boots wear out
[2:26:39] <+Taglog7> You should Vr w/ Zone
[2:26:47] <+Cymen90> @RAAAAAINMAKER Give measles blankets to the BTs!
[2:26:53] <+primax104> Oculus quest is a cool thing
[2:26:54] <+tuchpi> @chronoxgp you have balancing mechanics cause you're carrying a ton of shit LUL
[2:27:08] <GoldeNOVA> Play Boneworks?
[2:27:32] <%heartbbyy> so it actually is QWOP
[2:27:37] <+Cymen90> Play beatsabre
[2:27:54] <%chronoxgp> i'd rather a movement penalty than balancing mechanics while casually strolling
[2:28:00] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @Cymen90
[2:28:12] <+primax104> I know this is a good learning moment and all, but it will be funny with what is coming up
[2:28:19] <mrfreezepunsbestpuns> Go high to balance forward?
[2:28:21] <+linSP> you get more stuff the further you go into chapter 3 that makes it easier to do the earlier missions
[2:28:26] <+theAncopro> the balance thing does kind of get negated by the next upgrade
[2:28:45] <shameimarusen> Cant wait for him to be addicted to building roads
[2:28:47] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Does this ladder make my ass look fat?
[2:28:50] <+primax104> yeah eventually you are basically UPS batman
[2:29:00] <NotHereToStream> unequip your dick
[2:29:15] <peachy996> go 2 da boat
[2:29:24] <+Stupid121v2> someone else might find it
[2:29:27] <mrfreezepunsbestpuns> balance toward your back sucks ass, I'd rather be leaning any other single way.
[2:29:29] <+theAncopro> bike will be there for you
[2:29:32] <i_heart_gaming> he is littering a whole vehicle.
[2:29:32] <+theAncopro> when you come home
[2:29:33] <Infinit_Phoenix> I think being back heavy is mostly only dangerous when being grabbed by bts

[2:34:43] <NotHereToStream> your sob story tires me ResidentSleeper
[2:34:44] <heroicspiritavenger> He does it on purpose as an excuse to talk to people due to his social anxiety issues @theancopro
[2:34:48] <$Swish19XX> Sam is just like huh, what? I just wanna deliver
[2:34:48] <+paladinstarbuster> FEET

[2:35:32] <+Freelance7> Good, hate it more
[2:35:33] <mayorrev> i think someone said that when "Amelie" is pronounced in Japanese it sounds like "amerie"
[2:35:34] <shameimarusen> Not a fan of the dress either
[2:35:36] <i_heart_gaming> Sam looks so cool with sunglasses on in his own dreams
[2:35:38] <yuribo26> Is young Linda portrayed by Linda too or a different actress?
[2:35:40] <mayorrev> "amerie" ka
[2:35:45] <GoldeNOVA> Sam is the only relatable character, he's the only character as disinterested in the plot as I am
[2:35:49] <peachy996> Is it because it reminds you of Alice in Resident Evil?
[2:35:51] <heroicspiritavenger> @stupid121v2 she has a firm looking butt though
[2:35:52] <OldManDeckardCain> yes, your dreams take you to a "bitch" Kappa

[2:52:29] <i_heart_gaming> everybody got that ground zeroes refrence?
[2:52:36] <%Grabnok> nope
[2:52:44] <i_heart_gaming> they said ground zeroes
[2:52:49] <%sovayell> "when the fire nation attacked"
[2:52:51] <i_heart_gaming> that was also a game made by hideo kojima
[2:52:58] <+theAncopro> Nukes BAD
[2:53:00] <%ultrasparkseid> when the fire nation attacked
[2:53:07] <%Grabnok> ...i legit thought you were being serious for a moment. XD
[2:53:08] <caja_de_ojos> NUKES ARE BAAAAD
[2:53:08] <i_heart_gaming> Nukes BAD man
[2:53:09] <Graxe_> Nukes are still bad, man
[2:53:10] <iaraCatunda> nukes bad
[2:53:10] <+tuchpi> saying ground zero doesn't mean its a direct reference
[2:53:11] <$Swish19XX> Nukes good
[2:53:14] <i_heart_gaming> lol
[2:53:18] <iaraCatunda> nukes are bad maaaan
[2:53:20] <brunoberserk> kojima hates nukes
[2:53:27] <zenith0111> Nukes = Voidouts
[2:53:37] <i_heart_gaming> @Grabnok played like a fiddle! You ben had!
[2:53:38] <Infinit_Phoenix> all nukes organic or not are bad mkay
[2:53:40] <%chronoxgp> russia has like 20k of them things just sitting around probably
[2:53:42] <Graxe_> No, they said old school nukes
[2:53:42] <+linSP> kojima is Nukes Badman
[2:53:46] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Who doesn't hate nukes? They're literally the worst things ever
[2:53:46] <Graxe_> Not voidouts
[2:53:53] <aliceisdeadsuperfan> nonproliferation 4 life
[2:54:00] <%Grabnok> so...does a void out cause a chain reaction when other people get caught in the blast and die as well?
[2:54:05] <zenith0111> @graxe_ Killing people creates BTs that then create voidouts.
[2:54:17] <zenith0111> So nukes = A shit ton of BTs
[2:54:30] <%chronoxgp> what doesn't make sense is why void outs are only caused by human
[2:54:32] <+Freelance7> No, they are actually talking about nukes right now.
[2:54:35] <$Swish19XX> There are actual nukes though
[2:54:47] <+tuchpi> the terrorists used ACTUAL nukes
[2:54:51] <+theAncopro> basically
[2:54:53] <+untrusted_cereal> Wouldn't the nukes burn the bodies?
[2:54:58] <NotHereToStream> nuke to dead people to bt to voidout
[2:54:59] <+bread_assassin> Wouldn't it cause none?
[2:54:59] <Graxe_> Yeah, aftershot voidouts from a nuke blast
[2:55:02] <%chronoxgp> anyone who got cancer would cuase a void out
[2:55:07] <+DesertPenguin> not exactly
[2:55:09] <SolGoodguy> nah woolie, the nukes would disintegrate everything,
[2:55:11] <%Grabnok> Wait, but there needs to be bodies left for there to be a void out, wouldn't there?
[2:55:15] <SolGoodguy> you need a body
[2:55:18] <+DesertPenguin> a void out is a BT killing a real person
[2:55:18] <peachy996> Nukes would burn the bodies and timefall would reduce the fallout
[2:55:19] <zenith0111> @untrusted_cereal Close enough but lots would still die and create BTs
[2:55:24] <+tuchpi> no a voidout only happens when a bt touches a person, the people dead in a nuke are vaporized
[2:55:25] <+Scrub_Seeker> most people would be incinerated by the nuke
[2:55:25] <iaraCatunda> Norman looks dirty it's Norman's face
[2:55:25] <+DesertPenguin> or just touching?
[2:55:27] <Graxe_> There's still the radiation poisoning from the fallout
[2:55:34] <i_heart_gaming> so ghosts hate fire?
[2:55:36] <$Swish19XX> It's like when a BT comes in contact with a corpse or some shit
[2:55:37] <+DesertPenguin> Quipu my eggu
[2:55:38] <i_heart_gaming> fire good?
[2:55:39] <SolGoodguy> KNOTS
[2:55:40] <SolGoodguy> STRANDS
[2:55:44] <zenith0111> @desertpenguin Only Big BTs can because they have antimatter
[2:55:47] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Well, nukes are pretty much just voidouts, except people avoid voidouts by hiding underground from BTs, so when you nuke a place, good luck on anyone else getting away from BTs or voidouts comang after everyone who's left
[2:55:48] <%Grabnok> Okay so those caught in a Void Out would be disintegrated wouldn't they?

[2:56:53] <iaraCatunda> @cymen90 I'm joking
[2:56:57] <+DesertPenguin> Does every Kojima game have at least one thing that's really cool but never explained at all?
[2:56:59] <yuribo26> IT HAS HEALING PROPERTIES
[2:57:02] <%Grabnok> "HEY SAM YOU WANT SOME BUGS???"
[2:57:09] <Graxe_> They're really pushing the blood rope
[2:57:09] <zenith0111> @grabnok They don't explain you experience it through having a voidout
[2:57:19] <i_heart_gaming> @DesertPenguin yes, sometimes more than 1
[2:57:21] <%chronoxgp> reality -> seam -> beach -> great beyound

[2:58:21] <yuribo26> Yeah, Marvel said it
[2:58:36] <iaraCatunda> if you die in the beach you die in real life
[2:58:39] <%Grabnok> @zenith0111 okay I haven't experienced that. I did run from two big things on the mountain tho. that sucked. Last time i got caught before I took a break from the game
[2:58:41] <+tuchpi> you're a repatriate, you don't cause a voidout when you die FailFish

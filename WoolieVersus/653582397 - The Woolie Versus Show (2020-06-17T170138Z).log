[0:03:51] <%ChoculaUltra> Itâ€™s over, Fanny, I have the high ground.
[0:03:53] <$JonnyCue> How salty are we about that Bao Dur thing?
[0:03:57] <stealthfart> Has Little V mentioned if he has read the KOTOR comic?
[0:04:03] <themorrighan4> so looking forward to this
[0:04:14] <JohnAtDawn> How much longer does the game have? two hours? three?
[0:04:22] <LunarRemix> About four I think.
[0:04:25] <Second_Omega> 4 at most Iâ€™m pretty sure
[0:04:25] <LunarRemix> Four to five
[0:04:27] <themorrighan4> id say 3hrs 1hr discussion
[0:04:29] <LunarRemix> Those last two dungeons are quite long
[0:04:30] <%VCRUZZO> bout 4-5

[0:05:43] <j_is_manchild> They sure ainâ€™t talking to Bao Dor anymore.
[0:05:46] <ashenjuan25> Iâ€™d say the anime is behind about four parts behind they should be hitting the droid factory on the anime and that started on last weekâ€™s first recording

[0:10:41] <$rodreeg91> rodreeg91's Cheer shared rewards to 10 others in Chat! 
[0:10:47] <%DesertPenguin> What is this music
[0:10:51] <@Moobot> Please don't fill up the entire chat, @jake5713
[0:10:53] <andrei11dr> Not as fitting as HOSE MAD of course but, what can you do
[0:10:53] <derap41> What is this madness
[0:10:56] <LunarRemix> This sounds like Sith ritual music
[0:10:56] <ashenjuan25> Ghost in da shell
[0:11:09] <tiduidu> Ghost in the Shell theme
[0:11:11] <%DesertPenguin> Sounds like something you'd hear in Ash Lake of Dark Souls
[0:11:15] <%GiantPapaDoug> Woolz my sweet summer child clench your anus. we're about to go for a ride.
[0:11:19] <%DesertPenguin> Not anymore lol
[0:11:22] <memejima> FOR MANDALORE
[0:11:27] <%DesertPenguin> Audio seems low. My laptop is at full volume
[0:11:29] <GHouseduivel> @LunarRemix You should watch the intro video this music goes with.
[0:11:30] <Dynamo_Commando> Iâ€™m getting Demon Slayer vibes from the music
[0:11:31] <+Quarkee> there's a Japanese heritage garden near by me, and they have a whole exhibit about blade runner and ghost in the Shell, and this music is playing throughout the entire thing
[0:11:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> So, I'm planning on mentioning the concept of Ravel's branches and how it relates to Kreia and other Avellone characters, but without mentioning Ravel's name or any identifying details. Is that too much of a spoiler?
[0:11:33] <falyden> this music would be appropriate for the Je'daii
[0:11:36] <ashenjuan25> For Candalore
[0:11:43] <%alrobot2014> @jake5713 try breaking that up into multiple parts. Moobot gets real pissy when messages are more than 5 lines

[0:24:02] <GoldeNOVA> Atris is Jester
[0:24:11] <xBUBBA1995x> I had a dialogue boss battle with my D&D party last week. It was aginst the other players, and it made for an epic moment. I had to tell them off for being idiots and trying to kill themselves.

[0:24:13] <Matermind0> @ashenjuan25 Some of the class stories are pretty good

[0:26:40] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> People who say Korra sucks haven't seen that part I s2g
[0:26:42] <tolloponik> wait he got to season 2?!
[0:26:50] <+Feralspirit41> Korra was alright
[0:26:57] <%DatAsuna> i don't like that part but it's visually nice
[0:27:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> It was so Ghibli
[0:27:11] <$Invlux> Nickelodeon, apologize for what you did to Korra
[0:27:22] <+SarcFa> The part is visually nice, but I personally don't like what it did to the world lore imho
[0:27:24] <tolloponik> @CanadianAnimatorGuy that ruined a bunch of lore though
[0:27:25] <ashenjuan25> Never saw Korra loved the OG series is it worth it?
[0:27:25] <%VCRUZZO> it is visually nice...that follow up though...
[0:27:27] <+Feralspirit41> Nickelodeon has alot to apologize for
[0:27:30] <%brachydios777> Korra feels like it should of ended at season 1
[0:27:32] <+MrMoonGoose> Korra was fucking great.
[0:27:38] <andrei11dr> A faithful Remake of this game would be just Kreygasm
[0:27:47] <%GeneralSCPatton> I binged Korra in the last 2 weeks. It was perfectly fine.
[0:27:48] <%Theycallmenerf> Iâ€™m not a fan of Korra.
[0:27:49] <+Feralspirit41> Korra wasnt avatar level but it was still alright
[0:27:59] <$StaceMcGate> should of cut Robot Planet too Kappa
[0:28:01] <andrei11dr> But it will never happen because EA
[0:28:04] <%krispen_wa> THAT PADAWAN
[0:28:04] <+MrMoonGoose> Korra was fucking great *especially after season one*
[0:28:07] <%DatAsuna> some stuff also just added continuity errors
[0:28:08] <time_axis> did we need padawan girl under Dantooine?
[0:28:09] <ashenjuan25> Thatâ€™s a bummer but if itâ€™s ok I really donâ€™t get the hate
[0:28:09] <%vextalyst> LOVE KORRA except season 2
[0:28:11] <werunos> hey, I can't stick around to watch things live due to it being like 3 AM here but I was wondering, have you ever had any discussions about how like the entire cast is informed by trauma even outside the Interesting Force Philosophy stuff? I'd be super interested in heraing what you guys think about that
[0:28:15] <+Feralspirit41> Oh god that padawan on dantooine
[0:28:18] <huskarl_zap> My restored content mod isn't capable of being finished because a model is missing and it crashes when the enemy attacks me. Might happen to you aswell.
[0:28:19] <surik_at> Genoharadan is just plain sad
[0:28:23] <shutupandjam3465> droid planet was deliberatly taken out. They didnt like what they had done and wanted to wipe it
[0:28:40] <Halospaz117> Where's my wipes!
[0:28:41] <Doodle_Taco> I personally really dislike Korra but I can see why people like it
[0:28:42] <GoldeNOVA> Hard to do in the engine maybe
[0:28:50] <%gigas_trains> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE

[0:30:28] <andrei11dr> For being like 70 ,Kreia is holding all right
[0:30:28] <ashenjuan25> Mira sucks ass still
[0:30:51] <+mars_driver> It's the ONLY renegade option I take, even on full Paragon playthroughs. Just to make her the one person in the galaxy that hates me, while everyone else loves me.
[0:31:04] <andrei11dr> But you know Shit never shave
[0:31:06] <%brachydios777> @mrmoongoose I get that, but it kinda feels like the stakes lower a bit with a new world changing threat every other month
[0:31:07] <shutupandjam3465> literally didnt know how to live without the force but yeah its prety open for interpretation
[0:31:26] <%VCRUZZO> mmm
[0:31:46] <derap41> Man MK 11 is so good
[0:31:47] <memejima> "Your force is MINE"
[0:31:55] <huskarl_zap> force vampires
[0:32:04] <%Javaa01> Dark Side is spirit bomb charging from DBZ:Abridged
[0:32:10] <stealthfart> Mass Effect 1 had that space opera feel, that the sequels lost. BioWare games in a series kept getting worse the longer they went on and if not worse then they lost something that made it work in the first game.
[0:32:13] <%SmoothEnigma> her planet was all force sensitives though
[0:32:14] <petwisk> Force Genki Dama
[0:32:23] <MyNameIsRasus> many many wounds
[0:32:38] <ashenjuan25> Mass effect 2 still has some great character writing tho
[0:32:39] <+cowardman93> 1 person survived, BIG SUSPICION
[0:32:40] <%brachydios777> @stealthfart Bioware in general
[0:32:40] <%DatAsuna> Synthesis
[0:32:43] <%VCRUZZO> @SmoothEnigma so it was super fucked then
[0:32:54] <+Feralspirit41> Mass effect two was super linear compared to one
[0:32:57] <ashenjuan25> And even though mass effect 3 fumbled a lot there was still some greatly written moments
[0:33:01] <zeow31> her whole specie relied on the force
[0:33:02] <+jake5713> Darth Wools and Master V! Can't watch the stream atm. Just wanted to say thanks for making Wednesday's something to look forward to. You guys are one of the only good parts of this quarantine and I've been getting back into Star Wars. Between the end of Clone Wars, The Mandalorian and you guys, remembering why I love the franchise in the first place.

[0:34:53] <ZeeJiggle> Oh.
[0:34:54] <%SmoothEnigma> @invlux I believe in some cut content offscreen he jumps into a reactor somewhere to shut down another droid Factory offscreen and that kills him? could be wrong but that's what I remember from looking into it way back so dont take it as gospel
[0:34:54] <$Invlux> the gears are turning

[0:36:19] <@Commando_Joe> Raccoon based economy
[0:36:23] <xBUBBA1995x> My craving for dialogue boss battles is driving me mad.
[0:36:34] <+Feralspirit41> My families had more outback lately, we hadnt gone to the restaurant nearby in years because the service was so garbage
[0:36:37] <%OldManJEWc> Diet and exercise y'all
[0:36:38] <memejima> Such a Lust for Echoes...
[0:36:39] <+cowardman93> I'm only ordering from local places instead of the big chains
[0:36:42] <GHouseduivel> Cutting sugar is a bitch
[0:36:44] <+Quarkee> I work at a GameStop, so we're still open, and I just order food from the pizza place next door
[0:36:47] <%DemonOfSalt> Keto Diet V is the hero we don't deserve but we need in these times.
[0:36:47] <andrei11dr> Actually got i got my Cthulu lore wrong ,Nihilus is definitely Yug-Siturath
[0:36:49] <derap41> Then it taste fucking terrible
[0:36:52] <ashenjuan25> Saren is a great version of the dialogue boss battle
[0:37:03] <%Ghostbody> @quarkee You too? Jimmy John's for me
[0:37:03] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream

[0:37:14] <ashenjuan25> If a bit obvious in solutions but thatâ€™s a problem with ME dialogue wheel
[0:37:21] <damienlunas> Coffee is good for you

[0:38:19] <ashenjuan25> Universe
[0:38:20] <xBUBBA1995x> The concept of top-down works for many things. KOTOR, cleaning window blinds, learning your car, and gazing at women.
[0:38:21] <%Ghostbody> @vextalyst that's why it's called "Going up the Gary Glitter"
[0:38:21] <derap41> Its a very safe game
[0:38:21] <ashenjuan25> Chill
[0:38:29] <shutupandjam3465> what game? fallen order?
[0:38:34] <%brachydios777> Itâ€™s sekiro souls wars
[0:38:34] <Halospaz117> To be fair, what competition does it have in the last decade?
[0:38:36] <GHouseduivel> It's the closest thing to Jedi Academy
[0:38:37] <AvailableThor> Isn't it just SW dark souls?
[0:38:38] <+cowardman93> there hasn't been many Star Wars games in the past decade
[0:38:40] <%DatAsuna> So it's that and BF2/TFO? lol
[0:38:56] <KnightofNights2> There's some easter eggs that you won't get unless you're caught up with the CGI series.
[0:38:56] <%vaporousTippler> Best game since Jedi Academy.
[0:38:57] <MyNameIsRasus> LUL
[0:38:59] <+mars_driver> Maaaan, that new Squadrons game is gonna be loaded with lootboxes, and all I want is another round with my Rogue Boys.
[0:38:59] <ashenjuan25> Last Jediâ€™s poise system makes animations for bosses kind of lie to you
[0:39:04] <%brachydios777> Cal is a solid protagonist

[0:39:40] <%krispen_wa> jade empire is a perfect 7/10
[0:39:41] <GHouseduivel> 2005
[0:39:42] <%DemonOfSalt> 2007-2008 I think.

[0:40:07] <Huntercd> Fox ladies are enough for me
[0:40:14] <%MrMoonGoose> MrMoonGoose subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! So, when's Half-Life 2 (sorry if this already got answered, had to pay attention to something else IRL)
[0:40:20] <%spiritofmojave> It sure didn't!
[0:40:20] <%VCRUZZO> all I remember period was fox ladies

[0:40:45] <%brachydios777> WOW shocked
[0:40:45] <time_axis> Overpriced DLC is why I dropped Dragon Age Inquisition.
[0:40:47] <%alrobot2014> its been a goddamn decade since those games released
[0:40:49] <ashenjuan25> Iâ€™m not holding my breath for squadrons given the leaks kinda paint a Dire picture
[0:40:51] <ShiningAxis> Almost all the DLC is crap anyway
[0:40:52] <+Feralspirit41> You mean EA forced you to go through some bullshit designed to make a ton of money for things that arent worth the price they wanted? Noooooooooo not EA
[0:40:59] <Halospaz117> I don't think 1 was even on PS3
[0:41:01] <andrei11dr> Boy, im sure happy EA might purchase NRS ,why would you not be Kappa
[0:41:01] <%Irridium> It is BC with Xbone
[0:41:08] <%brachydios777> Black ops 2 is still $60
[0:41:08] <%DatAsuna> It came to PS3 years later

[0:41:15] <ralphfromdk> Looks kinda meh, it's 360 graphics, and runs kinda ass even by console standards
[0:41:18] <JetpackMcQuack> DLC is actually good, very short though for that price.
[0:41:18] <ashenjuan25> Thatâ€™s fucking awesome
[0:41:18] <derap41> Its best to pirate hte EA game overlay is fucked

[0:41:27] <%Zayasu> woolieFABRICATION
[0:41:28] <ashenjuan25> EA is the real Cerberus
[0:41:28] <Halospaz117> Like, didn't the PS3 version of 2 come with this comic book type summation of 1 cuz it didn't have a PS3 version?

[0:41:48] <leomuratore> One can hope
[0:41:49] <ashenjuan25> Shadow broker is great
[0:41:51] <KeiPrime> well NOW you jinxed it
[0:41:52] <andrei11dr> Woolie should play Dead Space someday

[0:44:42] <sANfouR44> I'm ready to feel vindicated when it will turn out they really got the worst ending because of HK factory. And i'm ready to eat my words if they won't.
[0:44:44] <ashenjuan25> Where is Mahvel?
[0:44:53] <leomuratore> LUL

[0:45:20] <liljojofett> If Squadrons isn't Ace Combat in space, I will be disappointed
[0:45:20] <%VCRUZZO> that is an improvement from the ones I remember last time I went
[0:45:20] <ashenjuan25> Finn should have been the fucking Jedi
[0:45:21] <huskarl_zap> NO, Kill the past.
[0:45:24] <endarren> They should just call it the Skywalker Lightsaber
[0:45:28] <JetpackMcQuack> They obviously named that before ep 9
[0:45:31] <andrei11dr> Anakin, ho that? Kappa
[0:45:37] <+cowardman93> @brachydios777 HOTAS full flight stick, it's nuts they're supporting stuff. Makes me more and more hopeful
[0:45:37] <Huntercd> why didn't Finn get one?
[0:45:39] <memejima> Slap a green gummy bear in that shit
[0:45:41] <AnneSQF> wouldn't Rey's be the yellow one from the end of RoS?
[0:45:43] <%VCRUZZO> @endarren thats spot on my dude
[0:45:46] <huskarl_zap> WRONG THE PAST IS KILL

[0:45:53] <%DatAsuna> ultrasabers too
[0:45:54] <%vextalyst> Hey V would u reccomend Kyber Brand?
[0:46:00] <SereneFox> House of mouse says fuck your canon.

[0:46:03] <%brachydios777> @cowardman93 Crossing fingers
[0:46:04] <+funnyfunnykid> Expensive stick
[0:46:09] <time_axis> I will never be okay with those lightsabers until they figure out how to do it without the big goofy plastic part.
[0:46:10] <surik_at> sure it's not crimson or smth, V& Kappa
[0:46:11] <%krispen_wa> So did Luke go from Guardian->Master?

[0:46:40] <+Deano8817> Influence lost: Kreia
[0:46:44] <andrei11dr> That's gilf quality right there
[0:46:44] <%ACrystalSage> Betrayal
[0:46:46] <ashenjuan25> Finn should have been protag tbh itâ€™s a similar but different set up for Luke too given Lukeâ€™s arc and how Luke rejected the dark of his lineage
[0:46:46] <%Ace_Clef> V listens to Tyler the Creator CONFIRMED
[0:46:48] <$JonnyCue> Holy lordy that starkiller saber on Vader's Vault is $2,600???

[0:46:54] <%DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus oh also if you quit the game during one of those atton sections, Atton becomes the title screen too lol
[0:46:59] <%VCRUZZO> damn

[0:47:18] <%brachydios777> @ashenjuan25 Should have been a equal character with Rey
[0:47:19] <%Lightwolfe> And guess what happens if you go dark side?
[0:47:20] <AvailableThor> It is such a quiet thing to change the main menu.
[0:47:20] <%VCRUZZO> @DatAsuna damn I forgot about that entirely
[0:47:21] <$BallerSwagBro9k> MALACHOR V: BECOME CRUST

[0:48:23] <+Feralspirit41> Darth apathy
[0:48:25] <lotharrio> The Dark Souls of KotOR 2
[0:48:28] <+greatgetter> Don't you have nearly 200 saves?
[0:48:28] <SereneFox> The game has fallen to the grasp of the dark side.
[0:48:31] <blackskulldragon18> she has turned heel
[0:48:32] <+logoth_> Boooourns
[0:48:32] <werunos> LUL
[0:48:35] <%Chisas_Dead_Body> Kreia really is a genius

[0:49:10] <+maenos2> yes
[0:49:11] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Atris sith name was Darth Karen
[0:49:13] <$NoWayRyanTatum> Lightside Sith storylines are SO GOOD
[0:49:16] <+09havocworm> I love SWTOR
[0:49:21] <time_axis> non-crazy sith
[0:49:26] <Mayachacha> 800+ viewers damn
[0:49:33] <+maenos2> lightside sith is SO FUN
[0:49:34] <AvailableThor> Darth Antihero?
[0:49:35] <$NoWayRyanTatum> They legit try to destroy the empire from within
[0:49:38] <ashenjuan25> Be-Treia-al
[0:49:42] <+kapcommunist> i came for the finale!
[0:49:44] <+serpenttucker> So lawful evil where as pure sith is chaotic evil
[0:49:44] <Halospaz117> Yeah like, you're still a sith, but you're not a fucking psycho
[0:49:50] <Knight972> Lightside sith warrior is SO good
[0:49:58] <+09havocworm> I always play a light side Sith
[0:50:03] <lotharrio> "I'm not angry. I'm disappointed."
[0:50:04] <+Aldesso> imperial Agent is the best Star wars Story i ever played
[0:50:07] <huskarl_zap> Sith warrior doing more Inquisiting than the Inquisitor.
[0:50:09] <%Claptrap_Killa> lighside sith is also not racist lol
[0:50:10] <+Feralspirit41> I still prefer the bounty hunter
[0:50:11] <Halospaz117> There are still some straight up good options tho
[0:50:22] <+kapcommunist> i was anime but fuck it, i wanna be here for the finale
[0:50:26] <%gigas_trains> Join the dark sides we have cookies
[0:50:27] <time_axis> seems like a crash
[0:50:32] <lotharrio> But we need to make it OBVIOUS!
[0:50:32] <+RowenCleric> is swtor free now or still subscription?
[0:50:36] <andrei11dr> RIP the game
[0:50:38] <+wunp_fxs> Voice acting adds a lot but takes away loads of choices
[0:50:38] <Halospaz117> @Feralspirit41 Female Bounty Hunter gets to be voiced by Azula and fuck a Johnny Yong Bosch Mandalorian, how can you not live it?
[0:50:39] <%mitchteck> Agent is so good
[0:50:39] <time_axis> oh
[0:50:40] <%alrobot2014> PogChamp
[0:50:40] <$Invlux> uhoh that computer thinkin

[0:50:44] <%alrobot2014> we won the fight
[0:50:45] <%VCRUZZO> its free...buuuutttt
[0:50:47] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @gigas_trains But the Jedis have Pozza
[0:50:50] <$BallerSwagBro9k> pizza
[0:50:50] <SereneFox> He does have like all the saves in the world, so it takes a while it seems.
[0:50:54] <+toastybites> yeah honestly
[0:50:54] <+greatgetter> Fallout 4 with its 4 options
[0:50:55] <ashenjuan25> A light side sith warrior sounds like a cool concept but like actually showing how the sith code could do good
[0:50:56] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> pozza
[0:50:58] <+DakotaMacDoodle> god damn fallout 4
[0:51:02] <memejima> Either make it linear or DONT make it look like theres a choice
[0:51:03] <+Feralspirit41> @halospaz117 wait azula does the female hunter?
[0:51:03] <%brachydios777> Fallout 4
[0:51:08] <+Aldesso> imperial Agent ist just a great James bond game
[0:51:08] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:51:10] <%vaporousTippler> SWTOR is free, but you have to pay to hide your helmet. So yeah.
[0:51:11] <Halospaz117> @Feralspirit41 yup
[0:51:13] <%alrobot2014> is there in game sound?
[0:51:13] <RantingRavager> question: is there supposed to be music?
[0:51:15] <$Invlux> ooh there's a battle going on outside
[0:51:17] <KiddKame> No Game Audio?
[0:51:19] <AvailableThor> HOW IS THE SHIP NOT FALLING APART?
[0:51:22] <+mars_driver> Eldritch Horror shouldn't have shot his mouth off like that.
[0:51:23] <%suitangi021> Am I just deaf or is the sound off?
[0:51:24] <GHouseduivel> half-dead
[0:51:25] <time_axis> is there supposed to be game audio here? Maybe its just quiet
[0:51:27] <lotharrio> Fallout 4 is the worst at that. Your options are: "Yes, Yes but I'm funny, Yes but I'm angry, tell more more but Yes."
[0:51:27] <%crumpetninja> No audio

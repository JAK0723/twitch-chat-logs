[0:13:41] <+theman515> He has the restoration patch, he said as such on his twitter
[0:13:43] <+ggbhtg> we need NEW LORE CHAT
[0:13:43] <ZeeJiggle> YOU DO IT
[0:13:43] <%gatorafan> I'm not sure why would anyone be letdown considering the game's content.
[0:13:43] <%WhackyChiraqi> yo who's this hot jesus type
[0:13:44] <%Shoosler> THIS IS BETTER @woolieversus
[0:13:44] <iamtheTwitchghost> little v is dressed for the occasion
[0:13:45] <Ser_Randal> nah do u
[0:13:45] <+QueequegTheater> Pockets left to do big crimes against those dudes outside the galaxy
[0:13:46] <%Solidnick18> i'm fine with it
[0:13:47] <+MisterTylerrr> Pat has also professed that he can't handle playing another big rpg with Woolie
[0:13:48] <Jaku2011> It's literally a different character anyway
[0:13:51] <%croxeye> hello and uWu who is this?
[0:13:51] <+JuggernautRyan> Who is this majestic dark jedi?
[0:13:52] <%ultrasparkseid> sajamCoffee sajamCoffee sajamCoffee
[0:13:53] <MutedMimic> That hair Kreygasm
[0:13:54] <Jaxnos> let us burn the Pockets effigy in support and unity
[0:13:54] <xdeathknightx> But I thought Reggie was new Matt and Minh was new Pat? Kappa
[0:13:55] <sonofthedeepsouth> Implying I coyld get disappointed
[0:13:56] <VidulaSaix> Much prefer you doing your own thing so rock on brother @WoolieVersus
[0:13:58] <DartonLance> screw pat more lil v

[0:14:01] <Fujiwara_92> YOU DO YOU WOOLZ
[0:14:02] <Ashenik1> @MisterTylerrr why though :<
[0:14:02] <ouijabirdz> Pockets needs a retribution arch!!! D:
[0:14:03] <Laironx3> This is your Woolie Shippuden but better
[0:14:03] <thebiganxiety> Completely fair.
[0:14:04] <+Exyoh> It would be bad for the lore for this to be Pockets again, even on that level
[0:14:06] <+linSP> its growing...
[0:14:07] <Enemy_In_Disguise> WoolieVs is Woolie and his Amazing Friends
[0:14:07] <DasFreekman> lore states pockets is off robbing the galaxy of everything
[0:14:09] <rumuloh> At least I can tell what this one is saying

[0:14:18] <%WhackyChiraqi> @xdeathknightx Minh is a human sandbag, he cannot replace nor can he be replaced
[0:14:18] <mihokspawn> Much like KOTOR2 and KOTOR

[1:28:52] <+BurningLlama777> @Redblood801 Oh my god Redblood you can't just tell people that they're write

[1:29:07] <+Whens_Marbles> HARVESTING HOOMANS
[1:29:08] <ScreamLord> @GeneralSCPatton Yeah but only a specific SUSTAINED frequency. A single short bang would do much
[1:29:08] <Pillagius> But sonic grenades basically imply there's still a physical force being released on detonation, so... It may not damage them much but should at least scramble sensors or whatnot
[1:29:12] <%Solidnick18> their organs
[1:29:17] <+QueequegTheater> BETTER HAN SOLO

[1:29:35] <+Exyoh> Better Carth is right. He's the best
[1:29:35] <+BurningLlama777> Star Wars is small and limited!
[1:29:35] <BallerSwagBro9k> CARTH 2 ELECTRIC BOOGLOO

[1:35:20] <jorniev> money is gray side
[1:35:21] <Kiari13> really rad that power
[1:35:22] <%Irridium> Mass Stasis + Death Field Kreygasm
[1:35:27] <+BurningLlama777> electricity runs the defribullator that revives a beloved father of three. Ergo force lightning = Light Side
[1:35:30] <pan_nochal> BATTLE MEDITATION
[1:35:35] <pan_nochal> that's kinda important
[1:35:36] <Kiari13> that one is real good
[1:35:43] <Archmortal> Massive war-shifting ability. Downgraded to a minor buff
[1:35:43] <+BurningLlama777> Mattle Bebigatin!
[1:35:51] <siamzero94> Fuck Bastila; steal that shit
[1:35:52] <Kiari13> i built my sentinel around buffing and that move was awesome
[1:35:57] <+RealThiele> the tech was spread
[1:36:04] <+Bluemanzee> It's a nice buff tbh
[1:36:08] <Redblood801> Put that skill in your Fanny Pack
[1:36:08] <AxelCezar> that is a bard power
[1:36:09] <+Xalgar> Being Light Side is great in this game because Kreia still questions your real motivations LUL
[1:36:10] <+QueequegTheater> Never use this
[1:36:19] <grouchio> So much force
[1:36:22] <CrmznOgre> MUKA SHAKA PAKA
[1:36:26] <Iwashi94> blood magic in Star Wars?
[1:36:29] <$TRILLTURBAN> Get it for the Pazaak Player

[1:36:58] <Kiari13> tbh i never used stun droid
[1:37:01] <person181> rocks
[1:37:04] <+QueequegTheater> Is it mandos
[1:37:05] <StaceMcGate> I believe Krei approves of that dark side action
[1:37:08] <BallerSwagBro9k> @BurningLlama777 I belive theres a Sith who did that
[1:37:10] <Klefth> Mandos
[1:37:11] <Safarihat> battle meditaion has dialogue effects
[1:37:14] <+RealThiele> stun in 3.5 dnd rules is hella OP
[1:37:17] <Nightweaver20xx> yeah when we playing Pazaak for 4 hours?
[1:37:18] <%medinaj1990> Actually, she doesn't. She thinks it's pointless.
[1:37:19] <+chiluzza> ya know droids can have sentience
[1:37:22] <+BurningLlama777> @BallerSwagBro9k Nice...!
[1:37:23] <This_is_Marco> blow up mimes D:
[1:37:25] <+bread_assassin> Gameplaywise, you want to be either 100% Light or Dark side, but storywise, it kinda pushes you to only being like 75% in one way or the other.
[1:37:27] <+chiluzza> you fucking kill something that is sentient
[1:37:32] <Archmortal> I used destroy droid alllll the time in KOTOR 2. Not even a little in the first game tho
[1:37:33] <jorniev> not the mimes!
[1:37:57] <This_is_Marco> *inaudible crying*
[1:38:01] <VidulaSaix> Scaling enemies are the actual best
[1:38:02] <+BurningLlama777> I'm a marshmallow and I only ever do 100% Good Guy, all the time. Cause I want to help people and make the world better. ;_;
[1:38:05] <VidulaSaix> Why doesnt every game have it
[1:38:11] <StaceMcGate> just noticed Little V is wearing Jedi Robes PogChamp
[1:38:19] <+RealThiele> scaling enemies is ok unless the game has a ton of backtracking
[1:38:25] <rumuloh> "Jedi" robes
[1:38:25] <Kiari13> lightning is fucked LUL
[1:38:33] <Archmortal> I mean it's still valuable to give the player a sense of progression that allows stomping on the old enemies
[1:38:34] <+Exyoh> 'Cause poorly scaled enemies are the worst, esp. in New Vegas, ironically
[1:38:34] <Holycow8498> Is Woolie doing a darkside run or lightsade run?
[1:38:36] <Kiari13> "love that one" he uised it maybe 3 times LUL
[1:38:38] <Nightweaver20xx> oh thats Little V
[1:38:39] <+QueequegTheater> It's so absurd in KotOR 2
[1:38:40] <+BurningLlama777> LittleVMills haircut = Qui Gon's haircut. Coincidence?!!!!
[1:38:41] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @grouchio
[1:38:44] <+QueequegTheater> Even more broken than in 1
[1:38:45] <+SkaiVibration> frame perfect????
[1:38:46] <CrmznOgre> force storm!
[1:38:50] <VidulaSaix> It's more satisfying to stomp enemies out with cool abilities
[1:38:56] <VidulaSaix> Not inflated levels
[1:38:58] <+krispen_wa> double weaving?
[1:38:59] <VidulaSaix> Imo anyway
[1:39:04] <Kiari13> debuff
[1:39:06] <+BurningLlama777> @grouchio No worries man the bot slammed me for that too
[1:39:07] <+RealThiele> FUS
[1:39:07] <Dragon_Batman> Sindel
[1:39:09] <grouchio> OF COURSE Rey can use Force Lightning! You could in KOTOR 2
[1:39:09] <SaturnianOcean> jermaChomp
[1:39:12] <This_is_Marco> force unleashed had the best force yeet
[1:39:14] <%GraceTBM> screm is pretty cool

[1:39:20] <Dragon_Batman> psaPorgmo
[1:39:25] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Fun fact, this is what Palpatine used against the three masters with Windu in Revenge of the Sith
[1:39:27] <Kiari13> fair enough
[1:39:29] <Cosmic_Pirate> AHHHH
[1:39:29] <+BurningLlama777> At what level do you get the Wilhelm scream?
[1:39:32] <jorniev> FORCE DRAIN A PLANET WOOLIE
[1:39:33] <+CaptainJax> The Sheev Scream
[1:39:35] <BurdRightsActivist> Is Force Speed still broken as SHIT in this game?
[1:39:36] <%FuqBoiSlim> wtf why does dark side get all the cool shit. its infamous all over again
[1:39:44] <+RealThiele> dark side always was stronger
[1:39:52] <Archmortal> @BurdRightsActivist yup
[1:39:52] <+CaptainJax> Force Speed is broke as FUCK
[1:39:54] <%Superspider51> Drain might not be as good as lightning but holy shit does it looks cool
[1:39:57] <T_Sasquatch> Right on time, fuck yea
[1:40:00] <grouchio> Sacrificing morality for power is classic dark side
[1:40:00] <+krispen_wa> force speed is even more broken
[1:40:04] <+QueequegTheater> @FuqBoiSlim Because the prestige ability for Light side is way better
[1:40:10] <+chiluzza> jack of all trade broken in all
[1:40:18] <Mayachacha> alright, who is this handsome white man?
[1:40:18] <StaceMcGate> Writers have been struggling to come up with good light side powers for 30 years. It's always healing or talking to animals or some crap
[1:40:28] <+QueequegTheater> @Mayachacha Dark Maximilian
[1:40:30] <grouchio> The Get Fucked Button
[1:40:30] <+Whens_Marbles> A shame we wont see Destroy..

[1:43:54] <Kiari13> @QueequegTheater to be fair didn't the other dudes in the kolto tanks have clothes on too?
[1:43:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> @stacemcgate Probably both. The more the user cares, the further they can push it, but they can modulate between making a scumbag change his ways and making space hitler kill himself.

[1:44:27] <+Xalgar> The inner machinations of my mind are, an enigma
[1:44:28] <+bread_assassin> Atton's like Carth, but not dishwater.
[1:44:29] <RyuuAoi> This is basically Sonic Adventure 3
[1:44:30] <+BurningLlama777> It's like he's ambivalent about good and eviiii*barf*
[1:44:31] <+linSP> is it pat
[1:44:32] <+supaXmugen> @Fujiwara_92 You take that back! Hes not NEARLY that bad! LMAO

[1:44:48] <+RealThiele> dumpster dive you naked jedi hobo
[1:44:49] <availablethor> Kreia is like "I'm always in the party, even when I'm not."
[1:44:51] <zocano> Atton is a genuine breath of fresh air after so much Carth analogues in Bioware games
[1:44:52] <MidnightBurst12> nothing but tits in that mind
[1:44:59] <%Superspider51> so much better
[1:45:01] <rumuloh> Carth but what if he was a good character
[1:45:04] <Kiari13> i dunno about him being that similar to carth LUL

[2:20:32] <SaturnianOcean> I like the atmosphere of Peragus, but it does go on a little too long
[2:20:34] <Blazeofflame> Do dogs have foreheads, or does it go straight to head?
[2:20:44] <%Zyquux> Is this Agent of Shield' Mac as a Jedi?

[2:36:20] <%Zyquux> Imagine having to walk around mine. This post brought to you by Mira

[2:37:02] <+BurningLlama777> @emperordread Haw
[2:37:02] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Oh wow, I only just now noticed the name LUL
[2:37:04] <Andrei11Droasca> Im fully confident that the new KOTOR project will get canceled and Bioware will deay a rough dead LUL
[2:37:05] <%RioGascar> issues in quality of life occur and polish occur
[2:37:07] <thekaijud> Character looks like Jeffrey Wright
[2:37:18] <siamzero94> shield only run?

[2:37:31] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Credits PogChamp
[2:37:34] <%DatAsuna> Look at this death pit
[2:37:36] <Kiari13> why did he put the shield on again, i'm dumb
[2:37:39] <+BurningLlama777> @Andrei11Droasca Agreed. I don't think a KOTOR III would survive in today's crap AAA hellscape
[2:37:39] <G_Lancaster> Why is Woolie playing young Jolee Bindo
[2:37:48] <+valiard> wow Fan Y'Paq
[2:37:53] <@Squdnate> 14 months to make a STAR WARS game, as a newly founded company, and with dumped assets and engine they have to learn... With a lower budget even
[2:37:55] <+valiard> rlly tho
[2:37:56] <grouchio> Plasteel....Stellaris right?
[2:38:01] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> SANIC gernade :pof
[2:38:01] <@Squdnate> Kinda makes things.. complicated

[2:38:20] <ZeeJiggle> Oh god was that a SITH LORD POWER
[2:38:22] <%Swedish_Expert> king crimson no noryaku
[2:38:23] <$GoogleyGareth> He just George Lucas'd towards him.
[2:38:27] <@Squdnate> also Woolie already unlocked the greatest force power
[2:38:30] <+doc_ock_rokc> Fann Y'paq was the secret force behind the Darth Pockets

[2:38:32] <grouchio> Stellaris is such a good companion for this
[2:38:38] <+emperordread> Is this room just a WWE elimination chamber match?
[2:38:40] <+BurningLlama777> This LP's gonna be great
[2:38:42] <jorniev> PING CRIMSOM IS AT IT
[2:38:43] <%RioGascar> And with how talk about obsidian is ran...its a legit question as to how much management is to blame
[2:38:46] <sagemodeanon> King crimson
[2:39:01] <savagedeviljayho> not playing as jedi jesus? booo
[2:39:08] <+doc_ock_rokc> Epichat!
[2:39:08] <Andrei11Droasca> "This is a test"
[2:39:12] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Management is nearly always incredibly to blame with big companies, anything to the otherwise is often them trying to get off the hook.
[2:39:13] <+QueequegTheater> @savagedeviljayho Jesus wasn't white tho
[2:39:26] <VidulaSaix> The random sounds are screwing with me cause I keep thinking it's someone in Woolie's house LUL
[2:39:26] <SnaKemuho> DROID MINING COMMENCED
[2:39:27] <@Squdnate> Kotor 2's development can be 95% blamed on LucasArts
[2:39:30] <thealientrilogy> THE FIRST OPTION IS EVIL
[2:39:39] <%RioGascar> i mean not always, sometimes the blame is on the team
[2:39:47] <@Squdnate> Not in this case
[2:39:48] <%RioGascar> *cough* anthem *cough*
[2:39:53] <alrobot2014> this motherfucker

[2:40:08] <siamzero94> oh wait that's robin atkin downes
[2:40:08] <+BurningLlama777> @NewAndTastySixthHouse Agreed 100%. I have in my head the concept of a "devil line;" the point of hierarchy at which a project's developtment changes from actual workers to clueless souless management fuckwits
[2:40:09] <jorniev> TRAVIS
[2:40:13] <Mechazoic_Era> Cam Clark??
[2:40:13] <+krispen_wa> LIQUIIIIIID
[2:40:14] <Kiari13> woolie LUL
[2:40:15] <Redblood801> Travis
[2:40:16] <+QueequegTheater> Just like New Vegas was completely Bethesda's fault, and Alpha Protocol was Sega's, and so on and so on
[2:40:17] <%Irridium> EXCELLENT SNAKE! THAT'S WHY YOU'RE THE BEST!
[2:40:18] <SaturnianOcean> Robin Atkin Downes
[2:40:21] <%Superspider51> MILLER!

[2:40:33] <%Swedish_Expert> damn it really is miller

[2:40:41] <person181> so it's THIS guys falut
[2:40:43] <%Irridium> why are we still here? Just to suffer?!
[2:40:44] <$GoogleyGareth> Can't get enough of his voice

[2:40:47] <+BurningLlama777> Modern Video Game Era: 9 Voice Actors
[2:40:47] <+krispen_wa> shit i thought that was cam clarke. I'm deaf
[2:40:48] <+kewlmyc> Goddammit, Travis
[2:40:53] <mistersups> RAD
[2:40:57] <+QueequegTheater> I hate Travis, makes NMH completely unplayable for me
[2:40:59] <+kewlmyc> FUCKHEAD
[2:41:02] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Anthem was also largely on EA, guaranteed that was another case of "Here, just make this game, team with no experience with the demanding genre we're telling you to do" and then woah, you mean shit went wrong.
[2:41:03] <+kyh9> Travis Strikes Again was good imo
[2:41:05] <+doc_ock_rokc> Travis is Eric Sparrow's anestor
[2:41:05] <jorniev> there are no more heroes in this world
[2:41:08] <+PleasantLeech> @riogascar I wouldn't blame bioware, EA is the big evil.
[2:41:10] <+gutlesscoward> big thinks
[2:41:14] <+BurningLlama777> He sabered us like a damn FIDDLLLLLLE
[2:41:21] <Shoegum> Robin Atkin Downes is Medic to me
[2:41:28] <Andrei11Droasca> Everyone from MGS is here and i mean EVERYONE
[2:41:28] <%RioGascar> No bioware shares a good point of blame
[2:41:34] <%RioGascar> Had years to actually work on it
[2:41:37] <%RioGascar> Got nothing done
[2:41:41] <jorniev> oh he is the tf2 medic?
[2:41:44] <+BurningLlama777> Every product is made by 483 splinter companies
[2:41:44] <siamzero94> LET THEM FIGHT
[2:41:44] <jorniev> cool
[2:41:51] <jorniev> nah FREE XP
[2:41:57] <%Grayhammatter> TRIPLE KILL
[2:41:58] <thekaijud> Is the Extended Universe still ongoing or did the mouse pull the plug on it from all avenues for the sake of the new trilogy?
[2:41:59] <Ashenik1> Obsidian's CEO is a piece of shit
[2:42:00] <%RioGascar> Not just “evil EA” being evil
[2:42:01] <+Xalgar> corpse (nothing)
[2:42:03] <+sherndon226> Bioware's problems have been upper management not being able to keep focused
[2:42:05] <+doc_ock_rokc> @RioGascar This one only had 14 months
[2:42:05] <reonome> EU is dead
[2:42:07] <+BurningLlama777> Every coder's fart is outsourced to a different Chinese subsidiary
[2:42:12] <$GoogleyGareth> @Shoegum His ordinary talking voice makes me think of Miller first, but I've heard him play the medic more than anything else.
[2:42:12] <jorniev> my power
[2:42:12] <Hillthugsta> @andrei11droasca even snake and raiden?
[2:42:23] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> @QueequegTheater I mean yeah, NV flaws were literally bethesda's shitass QA, AP had all kinds of bullshit stymieing them.
[2:42:32] <reonome> @doc_ock_rokc it was in preproduction for like 5 years
[2:42:42] <rosabellamelantha> Disney killed it because they thought their stories were better
[2:42:44] <siamzero94> was the same in kotor 1 right?
[2:42:45] <%RioGascar> @doc_ock_rokc And is held together by duct tape and unfinished. For 2004 this would normally not fly
[2:42:48] <+PleasantLeech> @riogascar I don't think you can blame the team for being disorganized. I really doubt they were being lazy
[2:42:54] <+BurningLlama777> Bethesda is an apple you forgot in the crisper drawer for like 2 months
[2:42:54] <+netrac> It was obsidian that didn't even have a ticket system
[2:42:56] <+bdawg_3834> extra attacks are so busted
[2:42:57] <+Xalgar> It was funny hearing Pat saying that people will talk about Outer Worlds for years to come when it was a pretty mediocre game LUL
[2:43:05] <Personified134> wait who's the guest
[2:43:08] <%RioGascar> i didnt say lazy, i would say disorganized is correct
[2:43:14] <+doc_ock_rokc> @reonome Preproduction under BIOWARE for 5 years before they handed it off. Just like anthem
[2:43:15] <mesamus> little v
[2:43:16] <+BioHunter> its little v
[2:43:17] <$TRILLTURBAN> @Personified134 LittleVMills
[2:43:24] <Personified134> was that the price of getting woolie to rap
[2:43:30] <+sherndon226> I got about 10 hours into Outer Worlds and then just lost all interest
[2:43:30] <+BurningLlama777> VittleMeeLills
[2:43:36] <Amardeux> @Xalgar yeah the beginning bit was fantastic, thenit kinda deflates towards the end
[2:43:37] <rosabellamelantha> They thought the EU was "too restrictive" and yet later came out saying they HAD NO IDEAS
[2:43:38] <s1rcuit> @Xalgar I agree, couldn't even finish it
[2:43:42] <Andrei11Droasca> @hillthugsta I dont think David Hater is in this
[2:43:43] <CocoonMoon> @Xalgar I already forgot about that game despite plaiyng the early portion
[2:43:50] <reonome> @doc_ock_rokc i thought the convo is about anthem im confused
[2:43:57] <@Squdnate> I personally loved Outer World awhole lot
[2:43:58] <%RioGascar> Speaking of outer worlds i need to check and make sure i canceled my game pass
[2:44:04] <PlumpPotatoRump> I
[2:44:04] <@Squdnate> It pleased the right itch
[2:44:10] <+BurningLlama777> @rosabellamelantha That's because they were Big Important Industry People who new better than the neckbeards
[2:44:11] <s1rcuit> @CocoonMoon I think everyone stopped shortly after the beginning
[2:44:12] <PlumpPotatoRump> @squdnate saaammmeee
[2:44:22] <+doc_ock_rokc> @reonome Its about how Obsidian is "Lazy" for being put under year long contracts for major companies
[2:44:23] <+Bryanofwg> Same @squdnate
[2:44:25] <SaturnianOcean> I loved Outer Worlds
[2:44:25] <+BurningLlama777> *knew
[2:44:36] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Outer Worlds was pretty cool
[2:44:44] <+PleasantLeech> I think it's hard to blame just bioware at least, it seems like it was a mess on all sides
[2:44:48] <+Estuko> pump up the jam
[2:44:51] <Joestar1890> @rosabellamelantha Yeah, it's BS. And I'd argue they're even more restrictive than Lucasfilm was
[2:45:09] <+doc_ock_rokc> @reonome also Antehm was 10 years
[2:45:15] <+Xalgar> I'm not saying it was bad btw, just pretty average. Didn't really shake things up.
[2:45:17] <grouchio> EDGE
[2:45:17] <siamzero94> couldn't get into OW. The setting threw me off
[2:45:33] <Fujiwara_92> Catherine Narrator: EDGE
[2:45:34] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:45:51] <GarbageNirvana> Outer Worlds is good if front loaded
[2:45:52] <+Stupid121v2> OW was fantastic, until the last bits
[2:45:56] <Andrei11Droasca> Woolie got Big EDGE
[2:46:03] <AMaidIndeed> !MOTIVATED
[2:46:03] <@Moobot> 629 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[2:46:10] <Amardeux> yeah OW kinda just feel meh after the mid-point
[2:46:24] <Crazyoise95> !MOTIVATED
[2:46:25] <ALTRNico> !uptime
[2:46:25] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 46 minutes
[2:46:25] <TangoNango> I lost interest with Outer Worlds. It wasn't really challenging and just got bored with the story.
[2:46:28] <%GeneralSCPatton> YEYEYE 2d8
[2:46:39] <s1rcuit> Speech is broken in OW
[2:46:56] <+CptnCampy61> Is V wearing with robes? I just noticed
[2:46:59] <+Xalgar> OW has so many useless consumables LUL
[2:47:00] <%LucentWulf> oh shit, little V is the special guest for KOTOR 2!
[2:47:00] <Kiari13> LUL
[2:47:06] <Amardeux> I think the main issue with OW is that there's no variation to the theme besides the whole big corp is bad
[2:47:08] <+CptnCampy61> *sith robes
[2:47:14] <+Stupid121v2> OW's weapons and leveling felt moot after awhile, like youre already unstoppable by level 15
[2:47:26] <s1rcuit> OW is also the most linear "rpg" I've ever played
[2:47:29] <天使42199> is that little v ???
[2:47:29] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> @Amardeux That's correct though
[2:47:34] <+Xalgar> @amardeux It felt like a Redditor wrote the story LUL
[2:47:37] <TangoNango> @s1rcuit Agreed. Way too many opportunities for speech and felt the levelling made things too easy.
[2:47:39] <Halospaz117> Doesn't the steam version have native widescreen now?
[2:47:40] <Amardeux> like you could have each planet have variations of themes besides the Big Corp bad
[2:47:40] <%Superspider51> @WoolieVersus I know the mod you're talking about and it breaks one of the saber colors if it is one of the mods I'm thinking of
[2:47:43] <Ser_Randal> Fann is a good boy
[2:47:47] <%Irridium> gets crusty
[2:47:48] <royb2> Is woolie going to play light or dark
[2:47:49] <ZeeJiggle> I imagine the "Toggle Headgear" mod will be on in the future
[2:47:49] <%Swedish_Expert> FeelsBadMan FANN
[2:47:52] <Fujiwara_92> good guy fann
[2:47:54] <Andrei11Droasca> I remember this game having a mechanic where you can combine weapons for stats ,but that might've been a mod
[2:48:00] <+QueequegTheater> @royb2 seems LS so far
[2:48:11] <天使42199> Little V ???
[2:48:13] <royb2> aight
[2:48:15] <alrobot2014> yes
[2:48:19] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> @Xalgar Ribbiters wish they were actually that correct very often
[2:48:24] <royb2> I just watched KOTOR 1 LP like 2 weeks ago
[2:48:24] <+QueequegTheater> @天使42199 No, that's Dark Ma
[2:48:27] <+QueequegTheater> *Max
[2:48:27] <Amardeux> so alot of planets are kinda uninteresting in OW
[2:48:29] <royb2> really good timing for me :D
[2:48:30] <Ser_Randal> Lightside is cooler in Kotor 2 anyway tbh
[2:48:31] <%OldManJEWc> He looks like the collegehumor guy
[2:48:35] <Kiari13> jermaVenus
[2:48:37] <+PleasantLeech> he is using the restoration mod right?
[2:48:38] <Redblood801> Level Up!
[2:48:44] <alrobot2014> also yes
[2:48:47] <+Stupid121v2> Lightside in 2 is better, imo
[2:48:52] <天使42199> @QueequegTheater I see
[2:48:55] <%GraceTBM> implants are sick in this game
[2:48:55] <grouchio> Bill of Rights perk
[2:49:04] <+QueequegTheater> Maximilian player 2
[2:49:04] <SiegeJay> Outer Worlds does not hold a candle to New Vegas than first thought. Dumb girl comes queen instead of dead like dumb raditiation guy wanting to be super hero
[2:49:09] <Kiari13> OP as fuck
[2:49:09] <Hillthugsta> mines are SUPER useful in this game
[2:49:26] <GarbageNirvana> Man, didn't know LittleVMills was so hardcore into KOTOR
[2:49:36] <TangoNango> It just sucks that Supernova isn't really a good difficulty to choose for first time play
[2:49:37] <Andrei11Droasca> I will say ,the bad guy in this game is better than the one in KOTOR 1
[2:49:51] <SaturnianOcean> Malak is silly
[2:49:55] <Kiari13> pog
[2:49:59] <+Stupid121v2> @Andrei11Droasca 100%
[2:50:02] <PlumpPotatoRump> @andrei11droasca Agreed
[2:50:06] <zocano> High int is a fun playthrough
[2:50:07] <+zanzibar_junker> The Force is the real bad guy of Star Wars
[2:50:07] <+sherndon226> Lil V is killing it as a wingperson
[2:50:08] <ZeeJiggle> Well Kotor 1's story is fairly straight forward and by the books, really.
[2:50:09] <Ashenik1> @Andrei11Droasca which one LUL
[2:50:09] <+QueequegTheater> Malak is fine as a standard SW villain
[2:50:16] <+QueequegTheater> But Sion is so much cooler
[2:50:18] <ZeeJiggle> it just also does it super well
[2:50:19] <Shoegum> I did my first OW playthrough on supernova and it was pretty painful to start with but still trivial after a while
[2:50:25] <Kiari13> kotor 1 is just "star wars"
[2:50:27] <%GeneralSCPatton> Deflect is a great passive
[2:50:27] <rumuloh> Kotor 1 is so bad
[2:50:30] <Kiari13> but kotor 2 is it's own thing
[2:50:36] <coreyyotto> It just costs more once you're light side
[2:50:45] <%Superspider51> Kotor 1 is best Star Wars and kotor 2 works because of Kotor 1
[2:50:46] <rumuloh> 2 is the only good star wars property
[2:50:46] <Rixstarian> @queequegtheater Malak is a bit derpy end game. Most of the game he's fine though
[2:50:47] <+Xalgar> I love the hammy writing for Kotor 1 Dark Side LUL
[2:50:48] <%GraceTBM> just get what you want
[2:50:49] <+doc_ock_rokc> Sion and Nillus are great
[2:50:51] <+Stupid121v2> Kotor 2 is "star wars but legit philosophy"
[2:50:51] <%Superspider51> Kotor 1 and 2 together are the BEST star wars
[2:50:53] <TangoNango> @Shoegum Like, it has things I like but permanent companion death is off-putting, especially when the A.I is annoying to control.
[2:50:56] <%Irridium> I always pick lighting like first or second because it's just dope
[2:51:03] <PlumpPotatoRump> nihilus is so dope
[2:51:06] <+kyh9> Good-side lightning should be pumping life into something
[2:51:07] <Ashenik1> Kotor 1 is a great classic SW an Kotor 2 is a great meta SW
[2:51:16] <grouchio> You sure? JUST ASK REY
[2:51:19] <%DatAsuna> Don't take game mechanics too serious
[2:51:23] <Heyestus> force push is neutral and you can push people into all sorts of gnarly shit
[2:51:24] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Ya know, I never did finish Kotor 1
[2:51:24] <+Stupid121v2> MHMM
[2:51:24] <siamzero94> kotor 1 i wouldn't call bad, only a little bit too cookie-cutter
[2:51:30] <Mechazoic_Era> HEHEHEHE
[2:51:33] <+ejn127> LUL
[2:51:34] <availablethor> But Rey tho
[2:51:34] <+Jontman42> which one?
[2:51:35] <SiegeJay> Rise of Skywalker. God dam
[2:51:35] <%NopeBadguy> You'd honestly think Lightning would be part of the Wound/Choke/Kill tree, TBH @WoolieVersus
[2:51:37] <ZeeJiggle> There's apparently some kinda light side version of lighting, called "Electric Judgement"
[2:51:38] <AxelCezar> well ray can use forcelighting so...
[2:51:38] <+Xalgar> TBF Kotor 1 had to be both the beginning of a new universe AND the first of a series so give it some slack LUL
[2:51:39] <@Solidus_113> I still haven't seen ROS
[2:51:41] <StarlitStunner> Jedi have Lightning abilities too
[2:51:42] <Kiari13> i mean the sith sorc/assassin classes in SWTOR have lightning right away
[2:51:43] <$TRILLTURBAN> No but Reylo tho
[2:51:43] <SaturnianOcean> Manaan is my favorite part of KotOR 1
[2:51:44] <+doc_ock_rokc> @availablethor BZZZZZZT
[2:51:45] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus TLJ is probably going to go down as the best of the sequels, and that really says something
[2:51:47] <Sapphire_Breeze> @availablethor Rey who? Kappa
[2:51:48] <+krispen_wa> TROS SPOILERCAST 2
[2:51:48] <Daigrey> You're a Palpatine, Woolie.

[2:52:02] <holistically> Fann Y'Pack looks stinky
[2:52:04] <+sherndon226> @kyh9 Like infamous where you can use it like a defibrillator
[2:52:05] <+Jontman42> the big lightning was the best part of the movie

[2:52:09] <Kiari13> "melee"
[2:52:16] <+Stupid121v2> melee BANG BANG

[3:37:00] <QaizerArt> without you Lil V, this first planet probably woulda taken forever
[3:37:01] <RogerPoore> @WoolieVersus Why is the starting area so hard, seems harder than most anything in KOTOR 1

[3:43:15] <Kiari13> stuff like baldur's gate
[3:43:16] <+MrRabbles> Crpg = Isometric rpg
[3:43:19] <misterpans> As opposed to oen and paper
[3:43:19] <+sherndon226> Just means old
[3:43:19] <KnivesEve> mouse?
[3:43:20] <Sedrelic> jank rpg
[3:43:21] <+NiSoKr> I think it's a pen and paper style rpg on a computer
[3:43:22] <derap41> Torment, Fallout 1/2 Tyranny that sort of RPG
[3:43:23] <+stef5949> Old Ass term from when games were first starting to show up @WoolieVersus
[3:43:24] <AMaidIndeed> Like the iso metric ones like D&D
[3:43:24] <hntronium> It was when it was a new thing
[3:43:24] <SaturnianOcean> I imagine it's an older term
[3:43:25] <cherrycottontail> Yeah, it's computer RPG, refers to isometric rpgs traditionally - ultima, baldur's gate, stuff like that
[3:43:25] <+StrawberryPantsu> I thought it was Character RPG?
[3:43:26] <+sherndon226> Like Baldur's Gate
[3:43:26] <Ziginski> people usually use it for tabletop games in a video game
[3:43:27] <suitangi021> This is a descendant of games like Planescape and the first 2 fallouts
[3:43:27] <rumuloh> A PnP game put on a computer, like Baldur's gate
[3:43:28] <TechDragon_Z> Isometric, usually
[3:43:28] <MidnightBurst12> compared to tabletop rpg
[3:43:29] <%DatAsuna> Weird genre names? in video games?
[3:43:30] <+Xalgar> @woolieversus It's more an aesthetic/time period
[3:43:32] <Klefth> It's like an RPG, but clunky as fuck @WoolieVersus
[3:43:32] <DocMadfox> cRPG is also Classic RPG
[3:43:34] <+GeneralHysterics> remember, woolie doesn't know the difference between baldur's gate and diablo
[3:43:39] <%RioGascar> huh, i got kotor along with halo cause my dad loved star wars and i wanted to play this new sick shooter thing
[3:43:40] <%NopeBadguy> @WoolieVersus It's an old school DnD style RPG in the style of Baldur's Gate or Planescape Torment. I personally like to call them Conversation RPGs.
[3:43:41] <mihokspawn> CRPG is Classic RPG, because it is based on a existing game system

[3:44:22] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> CRPG is a sub genre. If you've played Bladur's Gate, Fallout 1 & 2, or the Divinity games you've played one
[3:44:22] <Halospaz117> @WoolieVersus Another bug I encountered with the PC version is that if you play one session long enough, it starts to automatically skip dialogue, the only solution is restarting

[3:45:30] <%DatAsuna> when's alpha protocol?
[3:45:30] <ralphfromdk> Off those 2, New Vegas is clearly the best. Way bigger, way more choises. One of their best
[3:45:31] <derap41> The hype kinda killed it for people
[3:45:35] <+QueequegTheater> Fallout 4 has by far the best weapon/armor modding systems

[3:45:43] <%Lion_kun> nEW vEGAS HAS WORSE GAMEPLAY BUT A BETTER STORY.
[3:45:46] <jorniev> DISCO ELYSIUM has to have a one off at minimum!
[3:45:47] <Shoegum> Remember when Obsidian made a tank game for a Russian publisher?
[3:45:48] <cherrycottontail> mask of the betrayer is my favorite obsidian game. I am probablyu the only one who will say this
[3:45:56] <SaturnianOcean> It certainly has its problems, but I still really enjoyed it
[3:45:57] <+OUTheTeam> too wacky imo
[3:46:00] <siamzero94> the world was just too over-the-top
[3:46:08] <Andrei11Droasca> New Vegas i really broken tho,you'd better learn how to mod @woolieversus
[3:46:09] <nikoloas_> low bar
[3:46:10] <%medinaj1990> God I love New Vegas, but the last time I played it I left myself in the middle of Lonesome Road. So whenever I go to start it I go like I don't feel like doing this and turn it off.
[3:46:10] <+BurningLlama777> Fallout 4 also has the best plot. "Be free, but now you do what we tell you"
[3:46:11] <derap41> The World has the potential for it but it needs a good sequel
[3:46:12] <Kiari13> fallout 4's fun to shoot things
[3:46:12] <%Irridium> lotta things are better than Fallout 4 LUL
[3:46:12] <Madbearv> Who's the other guy
[3:46:13] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Fallout 4 also sucked massive ass writing-wise
[3:46:16] <Fujiwara_92> new vegas 100% better than fallout 4
[3:46:16] <zenith0111> Fallout 4 sucked
[3:46:17] <+TheBigO75> literally anything is better than fallout 4
[3:46:17] <Psyramics> Fallout 4 and Outer Worlds might as well be different genres
[3:46:23] <BallerSwagBro9k> WORLD IS A FUCK
[3:46:26] <+Mr_Pylon> I don't recall, has Woolie played Disco Elysium?
[3:46:27] <+QueequegTheater> FO4 still has the best companion cast of any Fallout game
[3:46:31] <mihokspawn> But New Vegas, not FO4

[3:46:42] <%DatAsuna> Droid lives matter
[3:46:45] <Andrei11Droasca> Its better then Fallout 3
[3:46:48] <royb2> HK would disagree
[3:46:49] <redrins> except xeno lives, those are free
[3:46:53] <SubjectX07x> I personally have no problem with fallout 4 save for its writing and basically not being an RPG, it was like 3 steps forward two steps back.
[3:46:55] <+Xalgar> Eh brudduh, all lives matter
[3:46:55] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> FO3 was even worse than FO4 tbh
[3:46:57] <RyuuAoi> Ten years from now Woolie will verse Persona BibleThump
[3:46:58] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Kill all lives, long live death!
[3:46:59] <Magoloso> Just the concept of lives is important
[3:47:01] <Kiari13> probabaly yes
[3:47:03] <+PleasantLeech> fallout4 had potential but it misses the mark in so many places

[3:47:50] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Samurai were just knights, you fought for a lord and you were the heavy of the soldiers.
[3:47:51] <KatabolicRage> the hilairious thing about samurai and ninja is that ninja would abide their contracts to the letter, and samurai would cheerily backstab each other
[3:47:52] <grouchio> Oh noooooo are you guys done for today??

[3:48:47] <%Lion_kun> Hey Woolie, is Fanny Pack also gonna be evil?
[3:48:51] <+QueequegTheater> Woolie still doesn't realize that the universal truth he wants is extraordinarily close to the Catholic understanding of God
[3:48:56] <+BurningLlama777> Little did the samurai know, managers are idiots
[3:48:56] <KatabolicRage> Bushida and knightly chivalry have one thing in common, they emphasize loyalty to a higher lord
[3:48:58] <+Kduff89> dude jedi are huge hippies

[3:49:40] <%RioGascar> This game is held together by duct tape in both engine and design
[3:49:40] <+jpipeman> Yeah, especially since this one wasn't actually finished
[3:49:41] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:49:50] <Madbearv> Its better than kotor
[3:49:58] <Kiari13> sure yeah
[3:49:58] <siamzero94> the force is basically dharma just gives you magic powers as well
[3:50:02] <alrobot2014> How bout Republic Commando
[3:50:02] <Heyestus> KotoR got finished
[3:50:04] <Madbearv> Did Woolie install the fix
[3:50:04] <NoirePanzer> !MOTIVATED
[3:50:05] <@Moobot> 631 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[3:50:08] <suitangi021> It had more time in the oven than kotor 2
[3:50:10] <tacostarvedbeast> Fanny pack is a really good light side counter part to pockets kudos @woolieversus
[3:50:12] <Kiari13> def not
[3:50:14] <plushysceptile> I need to restart the first KotoR
[3:50:17] <%RioGascar> Kotor 1 feels like star wars
[3:50:17] <Djinnazz> no, it was still good.
[3:50:21] <+BurningLlama777> Uuuuu
[3:50:22] <%DatAsuna> No, the mod happened because it was loved
[3:50:22] <+TheBigO75> Oooh you might as well get a trainer for the restorted game.
[3:50:24] <Kiari13> it's still a good ass game
[3:50:24] <+MalekDracarus> I think this has a better story but both are great
[3:50:25] <%RioGascar> kotor 2 is expanded star wars
[3:50:27] <Redblood801> Story time
[3:50:28] <Invertin> no the game is good
[3:50:29] <+aledavencs> I played without the restored content mod and loved it, did 3 playthroughs
[3:50:31] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> KOTOR II was already really well liked even before the fan patches.
[3:50:35] <+GeneralHysterics> tell youtube to shove it
[3:50:35] <+Taglog7> PogChamp Lore
[3:50:38] <+BurningLlama777> o/` Capture the Moments o/`
[3:50:39] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> The fan patches just gave way more back.
[3:50:40] <Kiari13> yeah the fan patches just made it better
[3:50:43] <Jaku2011> That conversation is potential content
[3:50:45] <+BurningLlama777> o/` Lore Music o/`
[3:50:46] <scrublordsamurai> style switching is sick
[3:50:46] <%DatAsuna> The love made the mod, not the other way around
[3:50:47] <%Irridium> I'll be honest I first played it on the xbox and I loved it more than KOTOR 2. At first mainly because of all the little quality of life changes but also I just liked the story/characters a lot more.
[3:50:49] <Fujiwara_92> fuck youtube, who cares about them
[3:50:53] <+ToastyBroDude> So who is this?
[3:50:55] <LeBlanc233> Kotor 2 is a cult classic kotor 1 is just classic
[3:51:11] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus It would still be well known but not AS well known
[3:51:11] <siamzero94> well the ending is not a confused mess now with mods
[3:51:12] <Jaku2011> Almost missed out on content
[3:51:14] <%DatAsuna> Kotor 2 is so much more fun to play
[3:51:14] <Kiari13> cloud save @WoolieVersus
[3:51:22] <derap41> KOTOR was big enough that it would have been known at least
[3:51:28] <%DatAsuna> Crafting, combat .etc I can't go back to 1 for
[3:51:31] <+MrRabbles> remember the fallen
[3:51:31] <+QueequegTheater> NO DON'T OVERWRITE HIM

[3:51:51] <%DatAsuna> 1's crafting is such garbage

[3:52:00] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> ^^^
[3:52:08] <%Louie_Salmon> God them naming it "Xbox one" makes it so difficult to talk about
[3:52:15] <Djinnazz> I had no idea it wasn't finished.
[3:52:21] <+sherndon226> Oh im old I was 18 when it came out
[3:52:22] <Kiari13> @Djinnazz same
[3:52:25] <Djinnazz> still thought it was great
[3:52:28] <%Irridium> @Louie_Salmon did you know you can play Xbox one games on the Xbox One
[3:52:32] <rumuloh> I don
[3:52:33] <Jaku2011> It was very confusing
[3:52:35] <Shoegum> The original Xbox should be retroactively called the Xbox Big
[3:52:36] <alrobot2014> at this point lets just call it the progenitor xobx
[3:52:44] <+sherndon226> Kotor 2 was the first time I ever thought about the grey side and that made it great for me
[3:52:55] <%Louie_Salmon> Primordial Xbox. Xbox Prime
[3:52:58] <+ToastyBroDude> Hey, who's this dude?

[3:53:18] <%Grayhammatter> oof
[3:53:18] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Obsisdian wasn't allowed to fix Kotor 2
[3:53:19] <StarlitStunner> The non patched final on malachor jumps around like crazy without context
[3:53:20] <+Taglog7> WutFace WutFace WutFace
[3:53:22] <Halospaz117> WOW
[3:53:23] <ALTRNico> D:
[3:53:27] <Invertin> obsidian wanted to make a restored content patch but bioware literally wouldn't let them
[3:53:28] <Valentinius_Anodyne> LUL Nice
[3:53:29] <jorniev> WHY
[3:53:30] <Andrei11Droasca> KOTOR 1 is like "Black sa black can be and white as white can be"Wich is fine and very Star Wars
[3:53:31] <rumuloh> I don't think V's experience with this game is representative, KOTOR 2 was very well loved by fans before the mods, no way it would have been "forgotten" in any way
[3:53:32] <Halospaz117> That's just mean
[3:53:39] <Asakiira> The true dark side playthrough
[3:53:39] <+attackofthesage> I had the same happen to me for so many games lol
[3:53:43] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Oh no
[3:53:44] <jorniev> OH GOOOOD
[3:53:44] <Invertin> yeah kotor 2 was always hugely respected
[3:53:45] <+netrac> Dick move
[3:53:48] <+BurningLlama777> Geez
[3:53:51] <jorniev> FUUUUUUU
[3:53:57] <%spiritofmojave> That is basically the biggest uphill battle
[3:54:06] <Kiari13> yep, kotor 2 was for sure always loved
[3:54:06] <MidnightBurst12> kotor 2's plot is too interesting for it to just be forgotten
[3:54:11] <+SirGO0SE> people are forgetting, kotor 2 wasnt even well reviewed and it sold like shit
[3:54:19] <+SirGO0SE> the xbox versions was trash
[3:54:24] <+krispen_wa> thr endgame still sucks tho
[3:54:25] <%Lion_kun> uh is it mtued?
[3:54:28] <+TheBigO75> Yup
[3:54:29] <%Lion_kun> muted*
[3:54:29] <+SirGO0SE> pc saved this game
[3:54:30] <Kiari13> not muted
[3:54:35] <+sherndon226> Kotor 2 was built to fail but it has such interesting ideas it could never die
[3:54:37] <+ComicLord> No pat? sad
[3:54:39] <Magoloso> Not muted
[3:54:41] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> @rumuloh Same feeling yeah, even before the content restoration, it was already big, people being able to put things back in just made it get even more eyes.
[3:54:41] <Invertin> the obsidian curse: they always make the best rpg in a franchise and then don't make enough money for the owner to actually reward them for it
[3:54:45] <Ultimatefool> Hard to imagine Star Wars ANYTHING not selling well, but the prequels were some shit
[3:54:49] <%Lion_kun> How come I can't hear them anymore
[3:54:51] <cherrycottontail> So this isn't the restored content?
[3:54:59] <alrobot2014> may want to refresh your tab
[3:55:00] <+badjab326> does this have controller support?
[3:55:04] <SaturnianOcean> This VA plays Aric Jorgan in SWtOR, I think
[3:55:04] <worldbrand> refresh? im hearin fine
[3:55:05] <rumuloh> @Lion_kun Refresh
[3:55:08] <+BurningLlama777> Probably better with no Pat; nobody to derail the entire conversation with self-serving bad faith arguments 8)
[3:55:08] <+MrRabbles> @Lion_kun are you sure you aren't muted?
[3:55:10] <%Lion_kun> Ah k fixed it
[3:55:13] <Kiari13> oh shit i can hear it @SaturnianOcean

[4:07:25] <siamzero94> 'cause it was too slow in Kotor 1
[4:07:27] <+caffienatedjedi> @ChoculaUltra Because in the first game everyone complained about how slow it was. So they literally just sped it up for the second one
[4:07:28] <worldbrand> god that animation looks like how i imagine scp-173 walks

[4:10:18] <+thebonebard> the sequel cast should have just gotten a giant xwing the size of a frigate and they had to control it like a megazord
[4:10:21] <restingbones> Why do people seem to love this old MMORPG so much?
[4:10:35] <+ZoltanBMagnus> @Andrei11Droasca Droideccas?
[4:10:36] <+PleasantLeech> destroyer droids?
[4:10:36] <ProfessorLuigi> "Fann Y'Pak" how dare you
[4:10:37] <+QueequegTheater> @restingbones >:|
[4:10:39] <Kiari13> @restingbones most is nostalgia, some just like the sandbox over non sandbox mmo
[4:10:39] <+thebonebard> the story @restingbones
[4:10:43] <LeBlanc233> Just slap that into your eyeball real quick
[4:11:13] <Kiari13> @thebonebard did SWG have an overarching story? i didn't know
[4:11:13] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:11:14] <+thebonebard> i find the combat in the kotors to be quite dull but man its such a pretty game with great stories and filled with creativity and passion
[4:11:15] <+Comradeiota> @restingbones because it’s the best written Star Wars anything
[4:11:21] <restingbones> @thebonebard an MMORPG with a story?
[4:11:32] <+thebonebard> what?
[4:11:36] <+thebonebard> what are you talking about
[4:11:47] <+thebonebard> oh mmorpg
[4:11:49] <scoopyoopydoo> but starwars is like 90% mediocre now
[4:11:55] <+thebonebard> i thought you said this game
[4:12:01] <scoopyoopydoo> So like why get invested in star wars
[4:12:06] <Psyramics> @restingbones FFXIV
[4:12:07] <%Lion_kun> Using Lightning is evil.
[4:12:14] <jamesthebrave> The combat isn't super exciting but there is something satisfying when you're wrecking dudes left and right with melee or the force
[4:12:15] <%Irridium> and they change as they level up too
[4:12:20] <+Deano8817> m a s t e r flurry
[4:12:20] <sumo_cheesey_boi_san> blyat
[4:12:34] <+Comradeiota> Other stuff isn’t great so why should we see the good thing
[4:12:38] <+Comradeiota> ?????
[4:12:41] <+QueequegTheater> Flurry >>>> PA
[4:12:44] <Kiari13> ikr lol
[4:12:45] <+RealThiele> power attack + improved critical fuck everyone
[4:12:47] <+thebonebard> @scoopyoopydoo i mean rogue one was pretty entertaining and mando is great, obi wan show may be good
[4:12:51] <+SarcFa> wow you got through the turrets so easily, I remember being frozen stunned to death multiple times
[4:12:54] <jamesthebrave> Master Flurry + Master Speed thoroughly breaks the game over your knee
[4:12:55] <$TRILLTURBAN> Just spray the fuck chemicals everywher
[4:12:57] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> The MUSK
[4:12:57] <restingbones> I legit don't know a lot about this game, so whenever I see people play it I just wander what the appeal is. But yeah if it has a good story then thats a good reason.
[4:12:58] <scoopyoopydoo> cause there are good things not tied to shitty money making franchises?
[4:13:03] <+PleasantLeech> @scoopyoopydoo there's a lot of good stuff outside of the movies. the stuff Disney made non canon
[4:13:12] <@Solidus_113> big number
[4:13:25] <%Grayhammatter> big numbers
[4:13:27] <+Deano8817> @restingbones it's considered one of THE best stories in all of star wars, so yeah it has a bit of a reputation
[4:13:27] <+Extrallent> what class is he playing? just got here
[4:13:29] <Kiari13> please stop queueing standard attacks NotATK
[4:13:29] <+RealThiele> 3.5 rocket tag in full force
[4:13:31] <Kiari13> NotLikeThis
[4:13:34] <%Superspider51> sentinel right now
[4:13:39] <%DatAsuna> I specced into master power shot on the heavy repeater cannon and it was aces
[4:13:55] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> STEALTH: 0
[4:13:56] <scoopyoopydoo> @PleasantLeech oh good Ill waste more time trying to salvage star wars... OR I could just get on with my life and like something else
[4:13:57] <restingbones> @Deano8817 better than Clone wars?
[4:14:02] <Kiari13> my first playthrough i was just big strength guardian
[4:14:04] <@Solidus_113> Stealth=USELESS
[4:14:08] <+QueequegTheater> @NewAndTastySixthHouse Damn straight
[4:14:11] <Amardeux> Remember: No stealth
[4:14:15] <+thebonebard> @scoopyoopydoo sure go ahead
[4:14:15] <Kiari13> but my latest one was mega buffer sentinel
[4:14:16] <%GeneralSCPatton> @realthiele My man, knowing how the best edition works
[4:14:17] <+Deano8817> @restingbones very arguably, I think it's hard to compare them
[4:14:18] <+RealThiele> Rebels was decent star wars
[4:14:26] <Shoegum> Stealth (Nothing)
[4:14:32] <Kiari13> jermaPluto
[4:14:35] <qsirius> FANNY PACK LUL LUL
[4:14:37] <+thebonebard> rebels is pretty dang good
[4:14:40] <Andrei11Droasca> Ok my internet just craped on me for no reason, thats fine..
[4:14:49] <+BurningLlama777> I,)'m on m6 phone now lol. technology
[4:14:49] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> @qsirius Hey, put some respect on Fann Y'pak's name KappaRoss
[4:14:56] <+thebonebard> after season 2 clone wars becomes fantastic in a lot of episodes
[4:14:57] <%GeneralSCPatton> Deflect is a great passive
[4:15:04] <+EvilBeastofTheEast> Stealth i think you mean prolonging combat
[4:15:17] <Kiari13> damn is there any tv show that starts off good with season 1
[4:15:20] <restingbones> Im legit surprised, because all Ive ever seen of this game makes it look like any other of its kind. where you go kill 15 robots. and just stand and exchange numbers, to make number go bigger.
[4:15:30] <Kiari13> all i hear is "just wait til season 2" for so many shows
[4:15:31] <jamesthebrave> I watched through Clone Wars recently and enjoyed the hell out of it
[4:15:40] <Maleicus> Theres a force pull mod that is amazing
[4:15:43] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> @Kiari13 The Punisher show
[4:15:47] <jamesthebrave> There's some really fun arcs in S1, so I wouldn't skip it
[4:15:49] <+thebonebard> the gameplay felt better at the time of release
[4:15:51] <s1rcuit> @jamesthebrave 2d or 3d?
[4:15:53] <Andrei11Droasca> Stealth will assure a snailtrue
[4:15:55] <Kyopheonix> DARTH POCKETS 2?
[4:15:57] <+thebonebard> and the story really did make up for it
[4:16:06] <jamesthebrave> 3d
[4:16:14] <+PleasantLeech> @scoopyoopydoo hey not arguing with you. star wars is pretty dumb most of the time. there's a lot of good stuff, I think it has a unique aesthetic and there's so many good stores in the EU
[4:16:17] <+QueequegTheater> @Kyopheonix No, Fann Y'Pak is a good man
[4:16:19] <zenith0111> Oh yeah we going evil or good?
[4:16:19] <+RealThiele> so for rebels and clone wars, their first season has to draw in kids AND adults, i get that Ahsoka and Ezra are the characters kids will stick to fastest, and they annoy adults
[4:16:24] <+QueequegTheater> Good
[4:16:34] <s1rcuit> I liked 2d, fucking Grievous
[4:16:35] <+Deano8817> @restingbones must have not seen the hours of dialog or story then, there's a fuck ton of that. but in fairness, there also IS a lot of combat segments between story segments.
[4:16:37] <Andrei11Droasca> Will try to be good
[4:16:45] <Amardeux> !uptime
[4:16:46] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 16 minutes
[4:16:46] <+thebonebard> ahsoka becomes really good later, also i heard ezra gets better
[4:16:48] <Kiari13> there aren't any sci fi universes that are as cool as star wars to me tbh
[4:16:56] <+thebonebard> but im only on season 2 of rebels
[4:17:04] <rosabellamelantha> Ezra doesn't get better
[4:17:05] <jamesthebrave> Ahsoka is pretty great
[4:17:06] <jorniev> star wars is not sci fi
[4:17:09] <royb2> the only star wars game I've played is Jedi Power battles for ps1
[4:17:10] <+RealThiele> but after season 1 the characters are fully fleshed aye, and become good characters in their own right, ezra has gunsaber, which is hilarious
[4:17:16] <+thebonebard> yes star wars is sci fi
[4:17:17] <Kiari13> NotLikeThis still fucking queueing basic attacks
[4:17:18] <+thebonebard> its also fantasy
[4:17:20] <%Grayhammatter> getting that carbonite bath
[4:17:21] <restingbones> @Deano8817 i mean look at this...
[4:17:24] <+Comradeiota> @restingbones yeah old RPG combat be that way. But the writing is seriously where this game shines
[4:17:25] <jorniev> nah man its space opera
[4:17:28] <+thebonebard> there is a lot of science in star wars
[4:17:32] <Kiari13> you're right, star wars is not future science based, nor is it fictional
[4:17:34] <+thebonebard> space operas can be science
[4:17:37] <Kiari13> Kappa
[4:17:40] <jorniev> LOOKS AT ALL THIS SCIENCE
[4:17:41] <Shoegum> Star Wars is western
[4:17:41] <jamesthebrave> I have terrible memories of those fuckin' freeze rays
[4:17:49] <+Deano8817> @restingbones It's fine though.
[4:17:52] <+PleasantLeech> @jorniev you're right it's history
[4:17:54] <jorniev> space wizards
[4:17:58] <+RealThiele> from legends mostt tech in star wars isnt fully understood just able to be replicated like hyperspace tech
[4:18:00] <+thebonebard> if it has robots powered by electricity its probably science
[4:18:01] <Andrei11Droasca> But ,oh boy ,there are some fun dark side answers later on...
[4:18:02] <s1rcuit> @Shoegum it's in the western side of space
[4:18:02] <zenith0111> Star Wars is a space opera
[4:18:04] <jorniev> fake history
[4:18:07] <Hillthugsta> @andrei11droasca Stealth Run feat
[4:18:22] <+PleasantLeech> @jorniev prove it
[4:18:23] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1227284596695404550?s=19
[4:18:24] <restingbones> @Comradeiota Anywhere good I can read it instead? Cos Im not a fan of this sort of gameplay.
[4:18:40] <+Comradeiota> I’m sure Star Wars wikis would have story summaries
[4:18:44] <$laphyrion> Is Woolie playing as Pocket's Dad?
[4:18:52] <+RealThiele> son of pockets
[4:18:59] <Shoegum> Don't you remember that time when Luke herded space cows and came home to bandits having burnt down the farmstead
[4:19:05] <jorniev> there is no real life science in star wars just techno jargin
[4:19:19] <+thebonebard> browse twitter or reddit until the dialoug happens
[4:19:19] <rosabellamelantha> Oh yeah this is like the last room
[4:19:24] <+Tubnubbin> @restingbones Look up the Scorchy LP for this game; it's a classic if you can't stomach the gameplay
[4:19:25] <rosabellamelantha> besides the gas room
[4:19:28] <CrimsonGargoyle> @jorniev not with that attitude Kappa
[4:19:35] <+thebonebard> because this combat is not easy to watch
[4:19:41] <gps309> Little V POGGERS
[4:19:45] <+PleasantLeech> @jorniev hate to break it to you but a lot of scifi has made up science
[4:19:52] <Kiari13> maybe it's just me but i don't see the...anti appeal? of the combat
[4:19:54] <+BurningLlama777> if you just keel making prequels, you never have to advance your story
[4:20:00] <+RealThiele> einstein-rosen bridge we gucci fam
[4:20:02] <jorniev> based on REAL SCIENCE
[4:20:03] <+thebonebard> star trek has psudo gods
[4:20:14] <zenith0111> We gotta reuse the dagapogs into the fluming redactor to give a full particle charge for the chloride laser
[4:20:22] <SaturnianOcean> Combat will get quicker later. This is still the very beginning of the game.
[4:20:44] <+PleasantLeech> I guess it's more of a space fantasy than scifi
[4:20:46] <+Comradeiota> @zenith0111 you maniac, the heat sinks will never take it
[4:20:49] <+BurningLlama777> @zenith0111 don't forget the samoflange

[4:20:53] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 20 minutes
[4:20:58] <+RealThiele> star wars is a western with space clothes
[4:21:04] <+thebonebard> man those breath masks are cool
[4:21:09] <Pillagius> One thing I don't understand - why in Star Wars nobody made lightsaber with variable length?
[4:21:20] <SaturnianOcean> I think those do exist
[4:21:21] <+thebonebard> they do actually have variable length
[4:21:26] <Kiari13> pretty sure they do
[4:21:28] <+RealThiele> lightsaber butter knife
[4:21:29] <+Comradeiota> Someone made a lightsaber gun once
[4:21:31] <jamesthebrave> There was a character in the EU that had one of those. Corran, I think?

[4:21:36] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Actually no it isn't
[4:21:36] <Kiari13> swtor has shotos
[4:21:39] <+Comradeiota> You stick a lightsaber in it like a battery
[4:21:44] <+thebonebard> in rebels kanan even says "and this is the switch to change the size"
[4:21:45] <Heyestus> it's a relic from KotoR 1
[4:21:47] <+zepelinnn1> 4U
[4:21:52] <$TRILLTURBAN> It doesn't even seal around the sides lol
[4:21:53] <+taggerung403> Corran Horn made a variable length saber in the EU
[4:21:55] <+RealThiele> kanan best dad
[4:21:55] <+Tubnubbin> They were a thing in old canon. And in Attack of the Clones Yoda has a lil tiny one
[4:21:57] <+SirGO0SE> i wore that for like half the game lol
[4:22:00] <+krispen_wa> I'M GONNA BLOW THEM UP
[4:22:02] <restingbones> @Tubnubbin can't seem to find anything when searching on youtube. Scorchy?
[4:22:03] <Kiari13> Kappa
[4:22:03] <%Solidnick18> Kappa
[4:22:04] <Ipsenscastle> according the the visual dictionaries, lightsabers do have length adjusters
[4:22:06] <%The_Timo> Woolie, decent impression, but it's too easy to understand
[4:22:09] <zenith0111> Bane is Star Wars? LUL
[4:22:11] <+drustan44> Star Wars = Kurosawa / space adventure series lovechild
[4:22:14] <Shoegum> Is the lightsaber gun like that Nambu pistol with the attachable katana blade?
[4:22:16] <+freshest_bread> Oh boy
[4:22:18] <+freshest_bread> PERAGUS
[4:22:23] <royb2> I take the power f rom the corrupted Sith, and give it back to you! The PEOPLE
[4:22:31] <jamesthebrave> I like Peragus a lot but it does go on a WHILE
[4:22:35] <+RealThiele> lightsaber gun has the gun at the top of the hilt
[4:22:43] <+Tubnubbin> @restingbones My mistake. It's not a video LP, but a written one. From ye olden days before that sort of thing was popular on YT. Can I post links in Woolie's chat or will I get timed out?
[4:22:43] <%OldManJEWc> Actually Darth Bane exists lol
[4:22:46] <notenoughgirls> ahsoka uses a shoto in her off hand
[4:22:48] <+QueequegTheater> Any time someone says Trek is better than Star Wars, point to this game, then point to the Crystalline Entity
[4:22:50] <+SirGO0SE> @jamesthebrave the first person ive ever seen say that
[4:22:52] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I liked Peragus, Telos is a pain for me
[4:22:56] <Pillagius> @Ipsenscastle yea, but I mean like bam! and it's like 10 feet long, not "slightly longer/slightly shorter"
[4:23:00] <zenith0111> @oldmanjewc Does he use roids too? brucegScared
[4:23:01] <Kiari13> @QueequegTheater LUL
[4:23:02] <$TRILLTURBAN> Eyy i'm walking here Guidon
[4:23:17] <Shoegum> What about curved lightsabers
[4:23:17] <+BurningLlama777> Perhopodopolis
[4:23:25] <+RealThiele> trek suffers from the fact that humans suck too much to be big peacekeepers of the quadrant
[4:23:27] <Ipsenscastle> @pillagius probably just because it would be hard to write / make look cool
[4:23:37] <serpenttucker> I hate when shit only triggers when you read/know about it
[4:23:53] <zenith0111> @serpenttucker I actually like that :(
[4:23:54] <+katarjin> Coorta..Coorta...are you__ yet?
[4:23:55] <+netrac> One of my MANY stashes
[4:23:56] <%OldManJEWc> Nah, he was jacked because of being a mining slave
[4:23:57] <Ipsenscastle> Soul Calibur 3 had a style that used a size-changing staff, it looked dumb as fuck
[4:24:02] <Kiari13> that's why it's a fictional universe :)
[4:24:03] <jamesthebrave> @SirGO0SE I really enjoy the investigation and finding out what went wrong, as well as the slow escalation from malfunctioning mining droids to.... other threats
[4:24:15] <restingbones> @Tubnubbin I think I found it. On IP archive?
[4:24:20] <Shoegum> What about a lightwhip
[4:24:21] <+drustan44> man all of the tech in star wars is NONSENSE its just magic lol
[4:24:22] <+Tubnubbin> That's the one!
[4:24:24] <%Rodyle2> did Woolie say how long this would be? it's super late where I am ;_;
[4:24:27] <Kiari13> lightwhip exists yep
[4:24:35] <+RealThiele> if you modded to start at level 10 or so this game would be like a crazy detective game
[4:24:35] <jamesthebrave> It's got a neat little atmosphere to it that's the total opposite of the KOTOR opening stages
[4:24:40] <+SirGO0SE> @jamesthebrave yeah that part is interesting but the part about slow escalation is the issue. its three times as long as it needs to be
[4:24:47] <%Rodyle2> actually super early now
[4:24:48] <Ipsenscastle> light boxing gloves
[4:24:52] <Kiari13> Kappa right
[4:24:52] <alrobot2014> @Rodyle2 probably to the end of peragus
[4:24:53] <jamesthebrave> Exactly, yeah, it is super slow
[4:24:59] <bigbradish> @Rodyle2 he said that they were going to try to do a planet per session

[4:43:33] <+Deano8817> you can skip like whole 2nd half of the movie
[4:43:33] <DJR33DY> The Movie don't matter for shit
[4:43:33] <StarlitStunner> Clone episodes are the best
[4:43:37] <%Solidnick18> Movie doesn't matter
[4:43:39] <+EpitaphOfOndri> @WoolieVersus ifgnore the shit movie, get the chronological order
[4:43:40] <StaceMcGate> Best episodes are the ones around the clones, bless you Dee Bradley Baker
[4:43:44] <Skeletonmanners> the hand drawn movie tho
[4:43:45] <rosabellamelantha> @WoolieVersus watch it in chronological order
[4:43:47] <+theAncopro> we talkin about hunterxhunter
[4:43:48] <Kiari13> he's super hard LUL
[4:43:50] <+RealThiele> Modern Ahsoka makes me Eli uncomfortable
[4:43:50] <Cradlejack> Who is Woolie talking to?
[4:43:54] <%Superspider51> @WoolieVersus The series isn't in chronological order so you can just skip episodes and arcs you don't like
[4:43:56] <manwithaxe> yo, Kenobis clone wars design though

[4:44:09] <StaceMcGate> Baby Hutt do do do do
[4:44:10] <notenoughgirls> i love clone wars but its got a serious tone problem. like one episode will be about younglings making lightsabers and the next will be darth maul massacring a village
[4:44:12] <%DatAsuna> Playthrough ruined
[4:44:19] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @jorniev
[4:44:20] <+thebonebard> @Superspider51 nooooooo, plots in some episodes matter for later episodes
[4:44:22] <manwithaxe> Kenobis clone wars design is the freaking best
[4:44:23] <bleugh> we've managed to avoid drowning
[4:44:26] <rosemon5001> the episodes arent really in order for clone wars so there might be a bit of confusion @WoolieVersus
[4:44:26] <zenith0111> Orgasm Denial
[4:44:32] <+RealThiele> clone wars tone issues is against, kids show
[4:44:36] <%Superspider51> yeah but it's easy to bounce off any episode with Jar Jar
[4:44:38] <Kiari13> no that was his identical twin :)
[4:45:08] <+QueequegTheater> Woolie make sure to watch Clone Wars in chronological, NOT release order
[4:45:15] <rosemon5001> @Superspider51 clone wars made him bareable and funny at some points
[4:45:18] <zenith0111> atpRtsd And then everybody died
[4:45:24] <+CaptainJax> Day 7: shit continues to be fucked
[4:45:33] <%Superspider51> people defending Jar Jar?
[4:45:34] <+TheBigO75> Peragus is "Shits Fucked" for about 6 hours.

[4:46:23] <+RealThiele> jar jar in episode I as a child was ok, but it was overdone
[4:46:25] <+thebonebard> clone wars is fine in release order
[4:46:35] <+gonerampant> HK's voice actor is so damn good.
[4:46:36] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:46:45] <DJR33DY> Unfortunately Grievous was only cool in the 2d animated Clones wars to my knowledge
[4:46:54] <%RioGascar> The corpse beneath him says it all
[4:46:54] <%themanski_90> woolieVS_HE
[4:46:56] <+BurningLlama777> yup

[4:47:19] <jorniev> HK FUCKED THEM UP GOOD
[4:47:26] <SaturnianOcean> As cool as 2D Grievous is, I do kind of like him as a goofy weirdo
[4:47:26] <+thebonebard> yes kotor 3 by ea

[4:47:58] <+MrRabbles> i thought the math puzzles were alright for what they were
[4:48:06] <availablethor> INT is the best stat.

[4:48:23] <+LiveStreamOnyx> There’s a specific way to watch Clone Wars? I never knew
[4:48:32] <paizurihokage> Is there?
[4:48:33] <+thebonebard> lucas likely just gave a description of grevious and art to gendy and he worked with what he got
[4:48:35] <%RioGascar> This math check STOPPED 8 YR OLD ME FOR A LONG TIME
[4:48:49] <StaceMcGate> I'd skip S1 of clone wars tbh, very childish and still finding its voice
[4:48:52] <+thebonebard> i doubt all the greivous scenes were even finished
[4:48:59] <manwithaxe> i just punched console
[4:49:03] <+EvilBeastofTheEast> Math is strong with the force
[4:49:07] <Kiari13> i'm gonna be real with you chief, i am not watching clone wars in chronological order unless it's given to me already in chronological order

[4:58:57] <%Eaglestrike117> Oh yeah this is peragus this is shit
[4:58:58] <+SirGO0SE> FART GAS'D
[4:58:59] <ZeeJiggle> Bright blue BEAMS BEHIND HIM
[4:59:01] <%Eaglestrike117> the shit(
[4:59:04] <+MrRabbles> Paladin of his faith
[4:59:05] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Gas the miners, space war now
[4:59:05] <ALTRNico> GAS THEM
[4:59:10] <SnaKemuho> So blue he breaks the ceiling and comes back from the bottom
[4:59:10] <Shoegum> You can get enough iron out of a human body for a nail. I'd say it's worth the cost of mining
[4:59:11] <OldManDeckardCain> seems like HK is a fan of the final solution, eh LUL
[4:59:14] <ralphfromdk> Guy might legit be the first and only evil droid :D
[4:59:15] <StarlitStunner> Blue HK
[4:59:19] <tanarath> As Paragon as you can get.
[4:59:26] <+CaptainJax> Eat the children for the children
[4:59:27] <+mikeNmurdoc> those shades lowkey hard AF
[5:00:00] <Archmortal> wait a second, something's wrong. HK would love the probe the motivations of his clients
[5:00:05] <StarlitStunner> Sam Bridges glasses
[5:00:11] <+PleasantLeech> so I just learned that star wars is the origin of the term droid
[5:00:29] <+EternalJedi> '-') uhoh
[5:00:32] <reonome> ow
[5:00:38] <@Solidus_113> how many times have we run through "last jedi in existence"
[5:00:41] <%Solidnick18> of course
[5:00:43] <siamzero94> unfortunately
[5:00:47] <+katarjin> Going Blue?...boooring
[5:00:50] <StaceMcGate> bleeding blue
[5:00:50] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1227284596695404550?s=19
[5:00:53] <+katarjin> but have fun
[5:01:00] <+SirGO0SE> LuvSign
[5:01:03] <%Solidnick18> Nani
[5:01:04] <+thebonebard> i mean this character is only one of the last of the jedi
[5:01:06] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> "GANG, ROLL UP"
[5:01:13] <+thebonebard> jedi can be plural
[5:01:16] <+kaiju7544> Is there any way we can make woolz give in to the dark side?
[5:01:20] <jorniev> EL BARTHO
[5:01:26] <Kiari13> D: giving atton a heavy weapon
[5:01:30] <SnaKemuho> I hope Woolie will stop the Barth thing because Atton is genuinely a great character
[5:01:31] <+QueequegTheater> @kaiju7544 No, he already did that in the first game
[5:01:31] <+katarjin> Dark side has teh best force powers ever
[5:01:31] <ThePimpGuin> x
[5:01:48] <ZeeJiggle> Man, we got a LOT of shields.
[5:01:51] <KatabolicRage> pretty sure he can wear that armour you found
[5:01:52] <+thebonebard> i was told the light side rout is written better
[5:01:54] <HawaiiAnthony> I miss Karth's dumb ass
[5:01:56] <Kiari13> @SnaKemuho same, i don't see the comparison at all besides "first companion and male"
[5:01:56] <+katarjin> Force Crus his sooo goood
[5:02:01] <Ashenik1> but light side has the plot armour though
[5:02:02] <+katarjin> Crush*
[5:02:03] <StarlitStunner> Carth Onassi with a gambling addiction and a better coat
[5:02:05] <PlumpPotatoRump> @snakemuho ikr, but knowing woolie, we'll have to see
[5:02:13] <+supaXmugen> @katarjin Force BREAK YOUR BITCH ASS IN HALF!
[5:02:38] <StaceMcGate> all dex baby
[5:02:39] <+PleasantLeech> @kiari13 one thing in common is if you're a female he will be a sleaze to you
[5:02:46] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> I wish you could put a stupid looking hat on Kreia tbh
[5:02:49] <+QueequegTheater> Force Crush sucks in comparison to "Fuck off, all my buffs are literally always on forever"
[5:02:54] <+katarjin> @supaXmugen Eve bosses can't deal with it
[5:02:58] <Kiari13> i honestly don't remember any sleaze
[5:03:02] <ZeeJiggle> Ye but Crush looks cool tho
[5:03:05] <siamzero94> no he definitely doesn't
[5:03:07] <Kiari13> other than the begining one for humor
[5:03:07] <+BurningLlama777> Ooh, a ~scoundrel~
[5:03:12] <SnaKemuho> @PleasantLeech Exile has a reason for that to happen tho
[5:03:21] <+BurningLlama777> *swoon swoon*
[5:03:23] <+QueequegTheater> MAYBE DON'T LEVEL HIM UP TOO MUCH
[5:03:30] <ThePimpGuin> security tho
[5:03:35] <+CaptainJax> Sneak attack also procs on things that are stunned
[5:03:38] <PlumpPotatoRump> !uptime
[5:03:39] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 5 hours and 3 minutes
[5:03:44] <Kiari13> i used atton for most of the game cuz his character was great
[5:03:49] <+katarjin> @qu'...why not?\
[5:03:49] <StaceMcGate> Best strategy: Don't level anybody until you befriend them
[5:03:53] <+bokutachi_san> sneak attack just needs to be behind an enemy to work
[5:04:01] <+supaXmugen> I played Jesus who would just use force lightning on all the mobs (tanking the negatives as im a good guy using an "evil" power) and just destroying everyone.
[5:04:02] <Kiari13> but i always levelled him dual wield blaster LUL
[5:04:05] <+katarjin> @QueequegTheater Why not
[5:04:08] <tanarath> Stace is correct
[5:04:12] <rosabellamelantha> the best way is to NEVER LEVEL ANYONE
[5:04:12] <Tubnubbin> Atton is great, especially when you get to know his character after Nar Shadda
[5:04:17] <Hillthugsta> @toilet_chan or stunned
[5:04:25] <+QueequegTheater> @katarjin Because you need those levels later
[5:04:27] <CastellanVon> Is KOTOR2 a game where you need to be optimal? Seems really easy so far
[5:04:33] <Tubnubbin> I'd say no
[5:04:36] <%Irridium> @CastellanVon not really, honestly
[5:04:36] <+MrRabbles> this game unlike its predecessor will punish you for not keeping your party in shape later on
[5:04:37] <rosabellamelantha> I beat this game with a level 1 level 19 presitge character
[5:04:46] <KoalaBeige> I just bought the steam version. Give this man money Disney
[5:04:46] <Kiari13> @CastellanVon nope, you can get super OP real easy
[5:04:55] <+CaptainJax> There are a handful of fuckyou parts but the game's overall pretty easy
[5:04:56] <%Irridium> there should be a way
[5:05:00] <+QueequegTheater> There is a way
[5:05:05] <+QueequegTheater> can't remember it
[5:05:06] <StaceMcGate> there is quick select
[5:05:07] <+PleasantLeech> @kiari13 I've yet to beat this game so I don't know it's character very well. I'll take your word that he's not a carth
[5:05:11] <StaceMcGate> maybe f1?
[5:05:17] <+kaiju7544> @queequegtheater Must be a personal decision. Light side choices feel like things you should do versus the Darkside choices of what impulses tell me to do.
[5:05:18] <lethargicviewer> woolieVS
[5:05:19] <Kiari13> he is very much not a carth LUL
[5:05:25] <+supaXmugen> not at all
[5:05:37] <Kiari13> even surface level he's not the same kind of character, he's a rogue
[5:05:42] <Vivalabonte> Who's the guest this week? Is this LittleV?
[5:05:46] <Kiari13> carth is do gooder soldier man
[5:05:56] <%Binary_Fireball> soon to be Corpse (nothing)
[5:05:59] <+PleasantLeech> okay but he looks a lot like carth
[5:06:10] <+MrRabbles> and he whines like carth
[5:06:12] <+QueequegTheater> @Vivalabonte No, that's Maxilimilian Dood, Color Palette 2
[5:06:17] <SgtPepper5e> The rb or lb button should switch the characters without the menu
[5:06:23] <StarlitStunner> doodGlare1 doodGlare2
[5:06:29] <Vivalabonte> LUL
[5:06:31] <Tubnubbin> Atton gets to whine because he's been in space jail for weeks. Carth is just...Carth
[5:06:31] <+308caliber> Carth never cracks jokes like Atton tho
[5:06:34] <reonome> he's just blastin
[5:06:36] <+supaXmugen> i wish i could say what Atton is. its like what Kreia says to him "Your flaw is only slightly embarrassing."
[5:06:39] <$GoogleyGareth> So I just started blasting!
[5:06:40] <%Grayhammatter> set to BLASTIN
[5:06:40] <+QueequegTheater> "So anyways I started blasting"
[5:06:42] <Goraka91> Kotor 2 is very much not standard in it's story and characters, he's not Carth
[5:06:43] <%spiritofmojave> So I start blastin
[5:06:44] <Kiari13> yeah there's barely any resemblance to carth
[5:06:51] <@Solidus_113> YOU DIDN'T WIN
[5:06:51] <Lionkevinson> Is this ff12?
[5:06:54] <Wooliam> You didn't win!
[5:07:00] <Kiari13> LUL you don't say
[5:07:02] <+QueequegTheater> MAYBE A FEW
[5:07:05] <BallerSwagBro9k> "A Few"
[5:07:08] <%Grayhammatter> you didn't WIN!
[5:07:14] <reonome> get fucked metalhead
[5:07:15] <%spiritofmojave> Many a few
[5:07:24] <+katarjin> Aatton is totally this ones Caarth...just as annoying
[5:07:28] <HideousDeity> Why is the HK vocabulator HK-47 coloured?
[5:07:37] <%Grayhammatter> T-3 FeelsBadMan
[5:07:43] <Kiari13> @HideousDeity hmmmmm :)
[5:07:44] <+QueequegTheater> @HideousDeity hmm
[5:07:47] <+chiluzza> yes why iisss it colored when hk-50 wasnt
[5:07:49] <StaceMcGate> Aton is not Carth, Kreia is Carth LUL
[5:07:52] <PlumpPotatoRump> @hideousdeity mhmhmhmm
[5:07:52] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:07:55] <Tubnubbin> The closest to Carth in this game Woolie won't get because he's playing a guy
[5:07:58] <siamzero94> @HideousDeity why indeed
[5:07:59] <Kiari13> @StaceMcGate LUL true, they both whine as much
[5:08:09] <KoalaBeige> Is this Star Wars: CrimeWars?
[5:08:25] <SnaKemuho> basically Bastilla's Link from KOTOR1
[5:08:29] <+chiluzza> BUFF SHARING
[5:08:34] <+NiSoKr> Thats pretty cool
[5:08:40] <+katarjin> scuse me?..Kreia is the best
[5:08:44] <+SirGO0SE> kinda spoilery
[5:08:47] <+PleasantLeech> woah I forgot about that
[5:08:51] <Magoloso> LIKE EPISODE IX
[5:08:56] <ThePimpGuin> its like she is the Rey to your Kylo
[5:08:56] <Kiari13> @SirGO0SE as he said, it happened in the battle but he didn't see it
[5:08:59] <siamzero94> kreia at least has a ground to stand on
[5:08:59] <Hillthugsta> @tubnubbin I like the way Kreia trolls that guy on the ship.
[5:09:04] <Jaku2011> Maybe have her in that party all the time
[5:09:08] <+thebonebard> but better written
[5:09:13] <+kaiju7544> I just like the force crush animation.
[5:09:15] <+SirGO0SE> @Kiari13 ignore what i said its best that way xd
[5:09:16] <Valentinius_Anodyne> She also has the best writing
[5:09:19] <+308caliber> this is where that Kylo and Rey thing came from
[5:09:21] <StaceMcGate> Woolie vs Left battle continues
[5:09:23] <+Vantesla> Kreia is one of the best written game characters
[5:09:26] <availablethor> Yeah I wonder where Episode 9 got the "Force Diade" idea!!!!
[5:09:27] <SnaKemuho> IT'S DOCK AND PORTSIDE
[5:09:27] <Fujiwara_92> saying it's spoilery is more spoilery imo
[5:09:30] <Unicyclemonkey> Port
[5:09:37] <+SirGO0SE> ya ignore me
[5:09:48] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Kreia is a permanent member in my team
[5:09:53] <Fujiwara_92> SeemsGood
[5:09:53] <jorniev> oh shit
[5:09:56] <+Xalgar> Ignored LUL
[5:09:56] <reonome> LUL
[5:09:59] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yes
[5:10:00] <jorniev> TIME FOR THIS GUY
[5:10:00] <%Grayhammatter> LUL
[5:10:02] <%spiritofmojave> LUL
[5:10:05] <+CaptainJax> You guys SUCK
[5:10:15] <Goraka91> Obsidian dialogue PogChamp
[5:10:19] <mihokspawn> Pure Pazak
[5:10:21] <+sunriser101> this guy is good carth
[5:10:35] <+kaiju7544> Better cartg
[5:10:41] <+kaiju7544> Carth*
[5:10:45] <+Vantesla> Woolie added the fan restoration patch right? Just curious as I wasn't here for the start.
[5:10:46] <PlumpPotatoRump> doesnt mean to cast a shadow, but Atton's casting hella shade
[5:10:53] <+PleasantLeech> okay you're being a total carth right now
[5:10:55] <+reaver93> Is it just me or is all of the audio really low?
[5:10:56] <alrobot2014> yes
[5:10:59] <+MrRabbles> Carth: Enhanced Edition
[5:11:02] <StaceMcGate> This is modded yes
[5:11:02] <alrobot2014> not the audio, the mod
[5:11:06] <Heyestus> BIG MECHANIC
[5:11:07] <privatesargent> INFLUENCE
[5:11:08] <siamzero94> fuck influence
[5:11:09] <+ChrisAlgoo> carth was so bad he went into the future and ruined a character in Mass effect
[5:11:18] <Kiari13> the thing :)
[5:11:21] <Goraka91> Minmax that shit
[5:11:24] <+EternalJedi> rooH LORE
[5:11:25] <+krispen_wa> BIG INFLUENCE FOR BIG BOIS
[5:11:25] <+MrRabbles> Kaiden sucks
[5:11:26] <+Gamingand808s> unappreciated gem
[5:11:26] <jorniev> NEEDY BITCHES
[5:11:27] <Kiari13> some extra special things ;)
[5:11:31] <%Grayhammatter> big LORE
[5:11:32] <StaceMcGate> It is SO worth it to get people to rank 10
[5:11:34] <Halospaz117> Ok, so both High and Low influence are equally important, just make sure you commit
[5:11:36] <+sunriser101> sigh mass effect sophie choice, you want the racist or the carth
[5:11:38] <Fujiwara_92> INFLUENCER TIME
[5:11:50] <serpenttucker> Morrigon disapproves -10
[5:11:51] <GhostyTheSpook> Influence checks act on a scale, you can also pass those checks with low influence too
[5:11:53] <Jaku2011> And yet Ashley still got Virmired
[5:11:54] <+MrRabbles> a racist with hideous pink armor
[5:11:56] <+PleasantLeech> that's so cool!!
[5:12:03] <Kiari13> holy shit ashley is awful
[5:12:05] <%Solidnick18> cool
[5:12:14] <Magoloso> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[5:12:23] <SaturnianOcean> Influenced gained: Kreia Influence lost: Kreia
[5:12:24] <reonome> social ink up!
[5:12:27] <Kiari13> LUL
[5:12:29] <%Grayhammatter> INFLUENCER
[5:12:35] <Heyestus> If you tell her to shut up you also gain influence with her
[5:12:36] <Goraka91> They did the Exile dirty in SWTOR, they're equal to if not more powerful than Revan
[5:12:51] <rosabellamelantha> SWTOR did EVERYONE dirty
[5:12:52] <Kiari13> just give him the blaster and control him to the back
[5:12:55] <rosabellamelantha> that game sucks
[5:12:56] <ThePimpGuin> close quarters, remember the basics of CQC
[5:12:56] <Goraka91> True, true
[5:12:56] <+titanxnymph> titanxnymph subscribed at Tier 1. 
[5:12:59] <+katarjin> Ashly got better..kinda...still nuked her
[5:13:00] <+supaXmugen> is he seriously trying to get on Kreia's good side? that bitch is NEVER satisfied
[5:13:01] <StaceMcGate> They essentially made the exile a Revan fanboy/girl
[5:13:10] <ZeeJiggle> A smidge of nice
[5:13:15] <%Grayhammatter> just a lil' good
[5:13:18] <tanarath> TOR had a few good bits, but >EA
[5:13:18] <Goraka91> Revan only killed one Sith Lord, like 'cmon
[5:13:21] <+EternalJedi> give em the ol razzle dazzle
[5:13:24] <Tubnubbin> Rule of thumb to get influence with Kreia: either tell her that you'll consider her teachings or tell her to fuck off because you know what you're doing
[5:13:27] <rosabellamelantha> Also gaining high influence with Kreia is hard as shit
[5:13:32] <+Tearonex> LITTLE V MILLS!?!?!?!?
[5:13:34] <rosabellamelantha> I like doing it
[5:13:36] <+Spr0cket> is woolie going jedi or sith?
[5:13:39] <+supaXmugen> Old Republic MMO was fucking AWFUL
[5:13:39] <+Gamingand808s> be chaotic neutral
[5:13:41] <rosabellamelantha> but dear god is it hard
[5:13:43] <+Vantesla> @goraka91 The book did it really dirty. I can be ok of Revan being stronger, but the book made the exile look like a decent Jedi Knight at that.
[5:13:44] <%Irridium> not even worth looting
[5:13:45] <%Grayhammatter> nothing nothing
[5:13:47] <+BionoidLCR> @Spr0cket jedi
[5:13:58] <StaceMcGate> The republic loses battles because their helmets are just shovels
[5:14:05] <Goraka91> @Vantesla and then her murderer becomes a party member :)
[5:14:13] <+supaXmugen> Bioware's excuse that TOR would be KOTOR 3 to whatever was just shit
[5:14:16] <+CaptainJax> Shit's Fucked 2: The Shittening
[5:14:29] <Goraka91> I will say, the Light Side Sith stuff in SWTOR was really interesting
[5:14:32] <+QueequegTheater> Uhhhhh
[5:14:41] <reonome> LOUD SWEATING
[5:14:42] <siamzero94> i dunno
[5:14:42] <+ChrisAlgoo> zoom in on donte's face
[5:14:45] <Jaku2011> I must consult the elder gods
[5:14:48] <+EternalJedi> limesD IT'S A TRAP
[5:14:55] <+Gamingand808s> tor was ok. it wasnt that great as an mmo. but had great storylines
[5:14:55] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:15:01] <%spiritofmojave> We must dock with this biocursed Sith ship

[5:15:21] <StaceMcGate> thanks Carth...
[5:15:24] <HideousDeity> Did they not know stealth camo exists?
[5:15:25] <tanarath> As was the sith spy.
[5:15:26] <+Vantesla> Some of SWTOR stories are good and some where a mixed bag when counting the different class stories only.
[5:15:31] <OldManDeckardCain> oh hey pockets
[5:15:32] <jcflyguy> Pockets?
[5:15:34] <%stormhawk9891> POCKETS?

[5:17:52] <StaceMcGate> I really enjoyed SWTOR when I started, but then I quit the first year when the content dried up. Didn't have in me to play the other stories
[5:17:56] <reonome> teleports behindyouman
[5:17:56] <Goraka91> I like how Kotor went with the Dark Side, it's something that really should not be
[5:18:02] <+ChrisAlgoo> who's the guest?
[5:18:10] <Goraka91> Kotor 2 I should say
[5:18:11] <Ashenik1> V dont spoil so much though :<

[5:18:24] <+ChrisAlgoo> @availablethor thx!
[5:18:28] <+katarjin> @Goraka91 what do you mean?
[5:18:39] <%startstoprepeat> @StaceMcGate yeah, the second they moved away from class stories to just a general story for everyone, i checked out
[5:19:00] <Kiari13> the neophyte armor is kinda sorta like it
[5:19:19] <mihokspawn> Did you guys know there is a town in Montenegro that is called Kotor
[5:19:26] <+Gamingand808s> next kojima name proto agonist
[5:19:41] <Kain5707> chat who is the guest star?
[5:19:47] <%ChoculaUltra> idk how long it's been for you guys, but most if not all the raids can be done solo - they give you a lore related party of NPCs. The Revan raid was/is infinitely more dope with Sateele and Marr behind you.
[5:19:50] <%Grayhammatter> little v mills
[5:19:56] <+Xalgar> The combat animations are so good Kreygasm

[5:20:35] <%ChoculaUltra> as for the condensed storyline...yeah the Fallen Empire is so-so, they do throw in some class flavor depending on what you're playing but nothing akin to the stand alone class stories
[5:20:37] <Kiari13> shrug that CC right off

[5:21:31] <Kiari13> caster built pog
[5:21:32] <+PleasantLeech> yup
[5:21:33] <Tubnubbin> Yes, KotOR is built out of 3.5
[5:21:36] <rumuloh> 3.5

[5:21:40] <%Grayhammatter> we casters now

[5:21:53] <Kiari13> heal for sure
[5:21:55] <+Vantesla> If Woolie likes casting, then we know what he will decide later
[5:22:05] <+QueequegTheater> Kotor is literally 3.5 with star wars pasted on top
[5:22:05] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1227284596695404550?s=19
[5:22:23] <Kiari13> i wish there was neverwinter nights mods where they just did that too jermaPluto

[5:23:07] <reonome> vroom
[5:23:08] <Tubnubbin> jermaMustard
[5:23:09] <+IrishWeegee> thats rad
[5:23:10] <+Vantesla> Lightside Force powers is though weak in comparison to Darkside in KOTOR2 still viable. Just won't be murdering groups in two attacks.
[5:23:14] <%ChoculaUltra> its crazy how simple Kotor is - dnd + starwars = success but so many devs/pubs who've had the star wars IP is just like naaaaaah who wants free money
[5:23:27] <Kiari13> god i want more dnd and star wars
[5:23:30] <anarchywolves> Is he going down dark side or light?
[5:23:35] <alrobot2014> light
[5:23:35] <siamzero94> thank god for force armour in this game
[5:23:38] <Kiari13> i don't want to join a pen and paper group i want to play a game LUL
[5:23:49] <s1rcuit> right?
[5:23:52] <Tubnubbin> but tabletop is great
[5:23:57] <+DreyfussFrost> @ChoculaUltra What was the last turn-based AAA game you remember coming out? From any dev?
[5:24:02] <CastellanVon> RPG is not simple to make lol
[5:24:04] <Giothegame> Woah a special guest
[5:24:04] <jorniev> this ship is pretty corpsey
[5:24:08] <StaceMcGate> Dragon Quest 11
[5:24:08] <+PleasantLeech> I don't have time to make friends!
[5:24:08] <+308caliber> @vantesla I wouldn’t say weak, they just aren’t as flashy as DS powers
[5:24:10] <+Gamingand808s> i hope they dont fuck up vampire the masquerade 2
[5:24:13] <Kiari13> same jermaPluto
[5:24:18] <slatersev> most star wars games before disney were good anyway
[5:24:21] <jorniev> same
[5:24:21] <slatersev> nice variety
[5:24:22] <Fujiwara_92> I want to play a game, that's just a tabletop game, but it isn't 4Head
[5:24:25] <SaturnianOcean> I had a friend who kept talking about setting up a pen and paper Star Wars game, but he never did
[5:24:26] <+katarjin> Divinity OS 2 was dope
[5:24:28] <Kiari13> friendless crew
[5:24:28] <%ChoculaUltra> @DreyfussFrost uhhh I wanna say maybe Persona 5? Does Atlus count as a Triple A dev?
[5:24:34] <juxtest> How did all these soldiers get killed buy Atton is still doing fine
[5:24:37] <+BurningLlama777> I'd make friends but then I'd have to, like, shower
[5:24:37] <jorniev> DISCO ELYSIUM
[5:24:38] <askinWW> boo
[5:24:38] <Kiari13> zabrak bois
[5:24:47] <Ashenik1> Empire at War was the SHIT !!!
[5:24:57] <CastellanVon> Persona 5 is not AAA
[5:25:00] <%ChoculaUltra> oh and DQ11 I suppose, but both are JRPGs to be fair.
[5:25:18] <Kiari13> LUL
[5:25:21] <jorniev> when the tabletop disco elysium comes out im gonna play the shit out of it
[5:25:23] <+Gamingand808s> dq11 was amazing
[5:25:31] <+richter_the_d> Oh, we're playing the best star wars game
[5:25:41] <Tubnubbin> correct
[5:25:43] <+Deadpal> good job star war
[5:25:44] <+SirGO0SE> one star war pls
[5:25:46] <Kiari13> tracksuits
[5:25:46] <%Grayhammatter> a star war
[5:25:51] <+MrRabbles> pocket's outfit for a long time
[5:25:56] <reonome> P5 is AAA because its technically sega
[5:26:17] <reonome> a better question to ask is when was the last turn based game from a western AAA dev
[5:26:18] <SaturnianOcean> More where that came from
[5:26:26] <Kiari13> wouldn't flurry also be bad LUL more attack at the cost of to hit
[5:26:27] <+QueequegTheater> Don't level Atton yet
[5:26:30] <+DreyfussFrost> And yeah I would absolutely say P5 is AAA.
[5:26:33] <StaceMcGate> Warcraft 3 Reforged was AAA
[5:26:44] <StaceMcGate> noooo, stop leveling
[5:26:46] <Kiari13> that fucks me up @StaceMcGate LUL cuz it's not wrong
[5:26:49] <+QueequegTheater> @reonome Is XCOM 2 AAA?
[5:26:51] <Andrei11Droasca> I haven't dq11 yet because the composer hasn't died a terrible dead yet :)
[5:26:53] <availablethor> Don't Level Atton!
[5:27:00] <+QueequegTheater> DON'T LEVEL ATTON
[5:27:03] <+QueequegTheater> WOOLIE NO
[5:27:03] <Chester_goes_Berserk> Oh yeah, I forgit
[5:27:09] <+Vantesla> @kiari13 Master Flurry takes the negatives out.
[5:27:16] <availablethor> Oh well whatever.
[5:27:17] <%ChoculaUltra> can we not talk about WC3 Reforged? It's like talking about your friend who went missing for 16 years, but they found him, and killed him for some reason.
[5:27:19] <+PleasantLeech> why not level him?
[5:27:19] <Kiari13> @Vantesla he doesn't have master flurry tho :)
[5:27:21] <+OranHexthief> guys kotor 2 had a separate way to get the other stuff that didn't require levels
[5:27:23] <%startstoprepeat> it's fiiiine
[5:27:24] <Magoloso> He can level up, minmaxing is not a necessity
[5:27:25] <%Grayhammatter> why though?
[5:27:26] <+OranHexthief> hes fine
[5:27:27] <+RealThiele> warcraft II: reforged was a modern waddling out of the bloated corporate corpse that is now Activision Blizzard
[5:27:30] <reonome> i guess firaxis counts as AAA?
[5:27:35] <availablethor> Because of.... dual classing.
[5:27:40] <siamzero94> it's fine guys
[5:27:44] <StaceMcGate> The longer you hold off leveling people, the more benefits you get later after befriending them
[5:27:50] <tanarath> Crit build best build
[5:27:51] <SnaKemuho> first playthrough no point to minmax
[5:27:58] <Chester_goes_Berserk> these old-timey RPG mechanics like .o
[5:28:00] <StaceMcGate> the game is easy enough that it's not a big deal, but this will drive min/maxers crazy
[5:28:01] <reonome> no need for woolz to minmax yeah
[5:28:04] <Tubnubbin> If he doesn't level Atton how will he do the mandatory fight?
[5:28:08] <+PleasantLeech> I think they're going for a casual playthrough
[5:28:10] <Kiari13> @SnaKemuho pat made him minmax on kotor 1
[5:28:10] <+QueequegTheater> @SnaKemuho big numbers tho
[5:28:12] <privatesargent> the game isn't hard, there is no need to minmax that much
[5:28:19] <+Vantesla> @kiari13 Early level each of the three special melee attacks cause negatives. I was just implying later it won't be a big deal.
[5:28:20] <+QueequegTheater> @Tubnubbin You can get him to Jedi before that
[5:28:21] <Kiari13> yeah you can make it just fine LUL
[5:28:27] <ThePimpGuin> min/max is for cowards
[5:28:28] <+Xalgar> No shit. but he doesn't know that. Also, its a Bioware'ish game so you'll be beyond OP even without min/maxing anyway
[5:28:31] <SnaKemuho> that's why we don't have Pat on anymore Kappa
[5:28:36] <+RealThiele> this is bioware just merging open DnD 3.5 rules with video games
[5:28:37] <Hillthugsta> @tubnubbin mines.
[5:28:40] <+Gamingand808s> dont get attached to the grandma woolie
[5:28:42] <Kiari13> @Vantesla yes i know :) i was just commenting on mr mills' comment on his attack use
[5:28:48] <StaceMcGate> this is not a bioware game chat,this is obsidian
[5:28:49] <slatersev> stop being Pat
[5:28:57] <uncledoodsauce> swords are out of place in star wars
[5:28:58] <Fujiwara_92> wtf is this? we aren't Pat, fuck min/maxing
[5:29:10] <%ChoculaUltra> also I need to know - is V Mills cosplaying Anakin circa Episode 3 rn?! Cuz that totally looks like a Jedi tunic.
[5:29:10] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:29:12] <+QueequegTheater> @uncledoodsauce What do you think lightsabers are
[5:29:22] <+RealThiele> kotor 2 was obsidian, holy shit im big wrong
[5:29:24] <%that_Mojo_Izakku> woolieVS
[5:29:26] <Kiari13> i got glitched through a MAJOR door in the cut content robot planet
[5:29:31] <Chester_goes_Berserk> It's not a big deal really, tho the companion-only sections can be tough depending on the order yiu
[5:29:32] <Kiari13> like sequence break level
[5:29:34] <siamzero94> level cap is at 50, no way will woolie reach it without exploits
[5:29:37] <Chester_goes_Berserk> do the planets
[5:29:42] <+Xalgar> Imagine feeling like you need you need to min/max in a Bioware/Obsidion game LUL Casuals
[5:29:51] <+QueequegTheater> BIG NUMBERS
[5:29:53] <+Gamingand808s> yeah obsidion makes all the cult classics
[5:30:04] <StaceMcGate> This game was contracted out to Obsidian, and they got screwed HARD. Game got rushed out a year early for holiday release.
[5:30:04] <OldManDeckardCain> republic is always fucked tbh LUL
[5:30:06] <%Grayhammatter> one cheeky girl
[5:30:19] <Heyestus> This one weird trick gets you an entire armada. The republic HATES it
[5:30:19] <subjectg> minmaxing in this game looks so cool tho
[5:30:23] <StaceMcGate> They also had an extremely limited budget
[5:30:23] <+MrRabbles> gotta fill those POCKETS
[5:30:27] <Kiari13> pockets is cheekd up tho damn...
[5:30:28] <SoaringLettuce> shes the cheekiest
[5:30:40] <+RealThiele> imgaine being obsidian and getting screwed by this, only to move on to fallout 4 : NV later
[5:30:43] <Amardeux> DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY
[5:30:50] <Kiari13> what do y'all think she got in them back pockets... 😳😳
[5:30:53] <+Gamingand808s> pick up the mando and nightsister/handmaiden woolie
[5:31:02] <+QueequegTheater> He will
[5:31:02] <SaturnianOcean> Credits
[5:31:03] <powerprotoman> its a shame that pockets doesn't exist as far as this games concerned
[5:31:05] <Fujiwara_92> fallout 4 : NV DansGame
[5:31:18] <+Xalgar> Skyrim 2 PogChamp
[5:31:19] <+QueequegTheater> Hey I like 4
[5:31:28] <reonome> welp
[5:31:31] <Kiari13> fallout 4 is fun! just ignore the crappy story and dialogue style
[5:31:32] <siamzero94> YEAH CARTH IS DEAD
[5:31:32] <+Vantesla> The Hyperspace War with Exar-Kun was within the time period of Revan like a decade + before the Mandalorian War. So in essence in this period the Republic was in a near constant state of wars.
[5:31:41] <Fujiwara_92> fallout 4 is shit
[5:31:46] <TDAWS_MP132> rip carth
[5:31:49] <slatersev> 2 decades
[5:31:52] <scrublordsamurai> skyrim 2 skyrimjerb
[5:31:59] <reonome> its ok we got a new carth
[5:32:00] <thealientrilogy> RIP Carth
[5:32:00] <+QueequegTheater> 4 has better companions , combat, and sidequests than NV or 3 by a mile
[5:32:02] <+308caliber> where’s Carth
[5:32:03] <atin2000> Ah, I see woolie chose non canon revan info.
[5:32:03] <SnaKemuho> wait Carth dies in evil Revan route?
[5:32:06] <SnaKemuho> I forgot that
[5:32:06] <StaceMcGate> 4 has fun moment, but the story is the worst in the series. They ruined settlements by having way too many. Should of focused on one large settlement to build in
[5:32:09] <Kiari13> i like fallout 4's crafting wayyyy more than new vegas
[5:32:13] <reonome> WELP
[5:32:14] <+Xalgar> monkaS
[5:32:14] <+furiousfurioso> tomatoDread
[5:32:17] <+RealThiele> in a galactic level of government constant war sounds about right
[5:32:19] <+Gamingand808s> fallout 4 made me go back to wasteland lol
[5:32:33] <Tubnubbin> Not explicitly but presumably no one's gonna come back for him @SnaKemuho

[5:32:48] <Kiari13> because carth would be the admiral
[5:32:50] <+katarjin> @Kiari13 but NV had all that ammo crafting
[5:32:51] <manwithaxe> i dont believe he is dead
[5:32:53] <jorniev> WHAT
[5:32:57] <+DigbyMayor> YES
[5:32:59] <Heyestus> Carth isn't dead he's still on the star forge planet @WoolieVersus
[5:33:03] <BestTeaMaker> woolie's eyes just bulged
[5:33:05] <subjectg> Carth’s sippin martinis with the rakata right now
[5:33:05] <%FuqBoiSlim> LETS GOOOOOOOOOO
[5:33:06] <+QueequegTheater> Carth is probably still stuck on that planet TBH
[5:33:07] <Fujiwara_92> CARTH DEAD, EVIL WINS YEAH
[5:33:08] <+SirGO0SE> he's at least dead in our head canon now
[5:33:08] <StaceMcGate> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[5:33:09] <%Irridium> So... mission accomplished?
[5:33:11] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Carth runs like a bitch
[5:33:11] <%that_Mojo_Izakku> Carth's sheer force of will to be annoying will keep him alive
[5:33:11] <siamzero94> you would definetly see carth here. I remember it from my playthrough
[5:33:12] <jorniev> KOTOR 1
[5:33:12] <+thebonebard> wait this uses save file transfer?

[5:33:22] <manwithaxe> he's still alive in 2
[5:33:23] <Kiari13> @katarjin the incredibly janky system that they reused from beth's 3 crafting is not as good as fallout 4 to me LUL plus being able to tag components you need is great
[5:33:26] <Ashenik1> Old Woolie
[5:33:27] <+BionoidLCR> woolie how did you forget all that shit
[5:33:28] <StaceMcGate> oh yeah, Pockets killed Carth's son
[5:33:34] <Tubnubbin> I forgot Woolie made Carth kill his own son LUL
[5:33:35] <Maleicus> No you see carth later
[5:33:37] <reonome> 🦀CARTH IS GONE 🦀
[5:33:39] <+QueequegTheater> He runs off like a huge coward
[5:33:42] <Heyestus> @thebonebard it asks you questions in dialog instead. no save transfer
[5:33:42] <Fujiwara_92> NAH HE'S DEAD
[5:33:42] <+BionoidLCR> HOW DID YOU FORGET ALL THAT
[5:33:45] <Andrei11Droasca> Carth should be dead
[5:33:45] <Psyramics> he's just not involved
[5:33:45] <Kiari13> LUL
[5:33:46] <+Gamingand808s> woolie needs wookie assassin droid and mando as main team
[5:33:46] <ralphfromdk> On the island at the end Carth runs off on the beach trying to get mission to go with him.
[5:33:47] <+QueequegTheater> CARTH DELETED
[5:33:48] <$TRILLTURBAN> @thebonebard no it's based on dialogue choices earlier in the game, Woolie's picking them based on the LP
[5:33:49] <SaturnianOcean> Carth was broken after that
[5:33:50] <subjectg> there’s cut content for kotor 1 where carth can blow up with the star forge

[5:34:55] <+PleasantLeech> fanny packs can't be used for evil, that's just fact

[5:35:41] <Tubnubbin> @NopeBadguy Considering Kotor 1 protag fucks off into unknown space right after the game ends, not much

[5:35:52] <Ashenik1> This game is straight up horror in many places
[5:35:57] <%NopeBadguy> So is the Galaxy under Republic or Sith rule?
[5:35:58] <StaceMcGate> No matter what choice you made, Sith collapsed on themselves and the Republic is in a weakened state.

[5:42:48] <Hillthugsta> @subjectg YES! totaly forgot about thst
[5:42:49] <Goraka91> Boyega has definitely been blacklisted over the script thing, and Ridley must get so much abuse for her character she had no control in
[5:42:50] <+QueequegTheater> @lotharrio No, her much nicer cousin, Fann Y'Pak

[5:43:59] <yendoria> T visors are so damn cool
[5:44:04] <stinkydinks> @snakemuho melee builds don't need force powers imo
[5:44:09] <giga_bit> That name LUL
[5:44:12] <+QueequegTheater> @yendoria Also historically accurate
[5:44:13] <+thebonebard> because it doesnt wrap around the head well
[5:44:17] <Goraka91> Though speaking of other things Star Wars, it was great that Sam Witwer was Maul
[5:44:24] <subjectg> melee builds benefit greatly from force speed though
[5:44:26] <SnaKemuho> @stinkydinks he said he wants to play with powers more since Pockets was mostly melee

[5:49:40] <+RealThiele> pat would save scum to cheat
[5:49:56] <Magoloso> @snakemuho without even blinking. Nihilus would probably be slightly better
[5:49:58] <HideousDeity> Store inventories are randomized when you first look at them.

[5:51:14] <Tubnubbin> "This stick is bled with Dark energy to attune it with its user's evil intent"
[5:51:18] <Kiari13> they have damaged written on their foreheads
[5:51:23] <Magoloso> @queequegtheater He would be atomized in seconds. Maybe not dead but at that point it does not matter

[5:51:30] <+RealThiele> afton is casey jones atm?
[5:51:33] <Kiari13> missed loot maybe
[5:51:36] <Andrei11Droasca> Those guys remind of those edgy droids from clone wars LUL
[5:51:40] <SnaKemuho> @StarlitStunner Exile with max persuasion vs Jack would be pretty cool
[5:51:43] <Magoloso> @fuqboislim try to stop me. Shilling it is my duty
[5:51:43] <%Irridium> should loot the body
[5:51:45] <Safarihat> there is a repub soldier body
[5:51:47] <+MrMoonGoose> Missed loot
[5:51:48] <+QueequegTheater> @Magoloso SIon literally comes back from being pulped, atomized means nothing
[5:51:50] <Kiari13> oof
[5:51:53] <lotharrio> I love the Helpful Kindness droid series.
[5:51:57] <+katarjin> Rip lore stuff
[5:51:58] <jorniev> oh this one super good leave the other one
[5:52:18] <Tubnubbin> Yea, Sion is quite literally the "Man Too Angry To Die" image
[5:52:24] <PlumpPotatoRump> ^
[5:52:47] <Kiari13> LUL
[5:52:50] <Magoloso> I dunno, when you are pulped there is still enough for you to come back.
[5:52:52] <Kiari13> he's got the training wheels off
[5:52:52] <Sapphire_Breeze> LUL
[5:52:59] <+katarjin> Some fights I had to pause every turn
[5:53:16] <subjectg> that’s what the pause button is for
[5:53:22] <+QueequegTheater> @Magoloso Not really, his presence in the Force is what does it, so being literally atomized still wouldn't prevent that
[5:53:25] <Kiari13> there is indeed a button dedicated for that
[5:53:57] <+RealThiele> big cheats
[5:54:07] <subjectg> theoretically being atomized implies a cessation of consciousness so...
[5:54:10] <%Irridium> loot in the droid room that you missed
[5:54:12] <TheSundayCookbook> BagOfMemes
[5:54:13] <%SilvaChariot0133> Taking in the sights
[5:54:18] <+QueequegTheater> Not in Star Wars it doesn't
[5:54:24] <Safarihat> @WoolieVersus loot in droid room
[5:54:31] <+RealThiele> id be ok with atomization as long i release all my atoms potential energy
[5:54:31] <Amardeux> there's a loot able body in the droid room
[5:54:33] <+QueequegTheater> Obi-wan and Yoda both got atomized
[5:54:33] <Safarihat> rip
[5:54:37] <Magoloso> @queequegtheater that’s always the problem with cross-universe fights, rules don’t mesh together. In theory Scion could see the path to taking Scion out of commission
[5:54:39] <Amardeux> rip
[5:54:41] <subjectg> then i would call this “effectively” dead
[5:54:42] <PlumpPotatoRump> F loot
[5:54:47] <Fujiwara_92> let them play chat
[5:55:00] <+RealThiele> i doubt woolie looks at chat much
[5:55:08] <jorniev> the forceee
[5:55:14] <$TRILLTURBAN> He's not gonna look at chat while filming an LP
[5:55:14] <subjectg> although i agree that discussing this with universes of two vastly different power levels feels extraneous
[5:55:14] <Kiari13> this chat is just for us :)
[5:55:18] <siamzero94> or something else
[5:55:20] <+QueequegTheater> Influence ye

[5:55:27] <PlumpPotatoRump> he actively doesnt look at chat when playing as these vids also go to youtube
[5:55:28] <Fuji808> Atton's ability is to warn the player when to save the game.
[5:55:29] <+thebonebard> story as a mechanic
[5:55:34] <reonome> uh oh
[5:55:41] <Amardeux> unless reggie is there to look at us LUL
[5:55:51] <Tubnubbin> I mean, Trask already established that the pause menu exists in Star Wars canon so is that any different?
[5:55:55] <privatesargent> Atton can sense oncoming danger, wow, thats a unique ability
[5:55:55] <+BionoidLCR> @RealThiele break time is chat time

[6:03:39] <RedDragonMoth> it happened to me but it was fine after it
[6:03:39] <wahilliham> its not a save issue, a simple reload would fix it
[6:03:39] <alrobot2014> sometimes it just skips that entire scene
[6:03:41] <availablethor> It deon't mes up anything
[6:03:41] <%Grayhammatter> psa1guy
[6:03:41] <siamzero94> so last time i was here atton just ran away from me and the camera just followed him through the tunnels
[6:03:42] <Kiari13> "pretty sure we're good" Kappa
[6:03:43] <+doc_ock_rokc> its fine
[6:03:43] <TheHeroAppears> 1 guy
[6:03:43] <%Irridium> sometimes the dialog bugs out and just skips
[6:03:45] <$TRILLTURBAN> The bug doesn't ruin the save file, but the occasional dialogue will skip automatically
[6:03:46] <Jaku2011> Chat are you ok
[6:03:49] <Deadbulky> Its fine after
[6:03:50] <+Ixek> jermaOneguy
[6:03:51] <LeBlanc233> chat once again loses they're shit over nothing LUL
[6:03:52] <Halospaz117> This is weird, normally for me the dialogue kept skipping til I restarted
[6:03:54] <SnaKemuho> restart the game probably
[6:03:56] <Amardeux> looks like its only for that scene
[6:03:57] <Fujiwara_92> it will just autoskip some talks
[6:03:57] <%SilvaChariot0133> psa1guy (?)
[6:03:58] <Magoloso> 1 GUY
[6:04:00] <+RealThiele> Chat is big dumb, but together we invoke Crazy Talk
[6:04:04] <+furiousfurioso> psa1guy psa1guy psa1guy
[6:04:05] <alrobot2014> not sure what the talk about the entire save file thing though
[6:04:07] <CastellanVon> Keep going then restart when you can.
[6:04:08] <ALTRNico> DAMN U 1 GUY
[6:04:10] <ZeeJiggle> Yeye, is fair.
[6:04:11] <Halospaz117> This isn't Crazy Talk, this is a bug I actually experienced
[6:04:12] <+SirGO0SE> we get signal
[6:04:14] <reonome> FUCKING CHAT
[6:04:14] <Kiari13> fuck youtube LUL
[6:04:14] <Fujiwara_92> qhhh
[6:04:15] <+Taglog7> SeemsGood
[6:04:15] <+doc_ock_rokc> psa1guy
[6:04:20] <Jaku2011> 1 guy!
[6:04:20] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1227284596695404550?s=19
[6:04:22] <Halospaz117> But it looks like it fixed itself this time
[6:04:23] <rumuloh> Chat is wrong
[6:04:29] <@Solidus_113> the bug autoskips dialogue
[6:04:31] <availablethor> Nothing
[6:04:31] <Safarihat> its an audio autoskip bug
[6:04:33] <tanngnj0str> 1 guy
[6:04:34] <TheHeroAppears> everything is fine
[6:04:35] <availablethor> Chat is being dumb
[6:04:35] <TDAWS_MP132> maybe nothing
[6:04:35] <Scrub_Seeker> psa1guy
[6:04:36] <Fujiwara_92> the bug will skip some dialogue eventually
[6:04:36] <+thebonebard> 3?
[6:04:36] <%Irridium> save's fine it's just sometimes dialog bugs out and auto-skips after long sessions
[6:04:37] <Halospaz117> Normally the dialogue would keep skipping, but for some reason it looks like its back to normal
[6:04:39] <+Ixek> Apparently if that dialog skip happens it'll continue happening unless you reload the save.
[6:04:40] <TDAWS_MP132> this happens sometimes
[6:04:40] <wahilliham> nothing is wrong with the save KOTOR is just buggy sometime and itll autoskip character lines
[6:04:40] <Sapphire_Breeze> @WoolieVersus I think it's not save file related, I had this bug and a game restart fixed it
[6:04:43] <Amardeux> just make sure to save often
[6:04:43] <SnaKemuho> just restart the game and it fixes itself
[6:04:48] <Magoloso> Thank you 1 guy
[6:04:49] <supttersage> I don't think it fucks the save itself
[6:04:49] <+SarcFa> the dialogue got skipped and some people are panicking it will corrupt the file, largely you just need to save and reload and you will be fine
[6:04:52] <Kiari13> "one guy" Kappa
[6:04:52] <Fujiwara_92> restarting should stop it
[6:04:53] <FennecZephyr> To be fair, there's a lot of people in chat. it might be hard to tell if you saw it
[6:04:53] <+doc_ock_rokc> @WoolieVersus If the dialogue issue continued it would have effected your file but it didn't
[6:04:56] <giga_bit> It's a memory leak issues, happens when the game runs for too long @WoolieVersus
[6:05:00] <siamzero94> occasional skipping
[6:05:10] <CuttleCrow> always save often with kotor II
[6:05:10] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> The bug can be fixed by saveing and reloading, or closing and reloading the game.

[6:05:26] <Halospaz117> No, we didn't think it's over, we just thought it would persist until a restart

[6:05:40] <Halospaz117> This was an actual bug I experienced

[6:05:47] <Kiari13> also how the fuck is jermaOneguy a meme here of all places
[6:05:48] <siamzero94> but don't cry over missed dialouge then
[6:05:49] <+RealThiele> UNO MUCHACHO
[6:05:52] <%startstoprepeat> it's one bug that somebody was worried might've been another bug, very obsidian
[6:05:52] <RedDragonMoth> Don't sweat it, it might happen later on once again but its not game breaking or anything like it
[6:05:57] <Heyestus> You should restart anyway, it usually clears the dialogue bug.
[6:06:01] <Safarihat> its a memory leak bug
[6:06:03] <Deadbulky> One guy said the world ends in 1 hours gg everyone its been ice knowing you all

[6:06:11] <Blazeofflame> E GE JIN
[6:06:14] <Halospaz117> @WoolieVersus I don't think it would corrupt the save, but if the dialogue persists in skipping, you're gonna need to exist the game and re load
[6:06:15] <SaturnianOcean> jermaOneguy is a universal concept
[6:06:16] <derap41> This is getting out of hand
[6:06:16] <ZeeJiggle> The bug has a chance of persisting for quite a bit, consistent fix is to restart.
[6:06:17] <alrobot2014> biggest bug i've ever had with the dialogue skip was it completely skipping that entire scene, should be fine since we didn't though
[6:06:28] <CuttleCrow> it doesn't corrupt the save LUL

[6:06:36] <grouchio> PFFFFFFFFFFT
[6:06:37] <Goraka91> Hmm
[6:06:37] <Sapphire_Breeze> NOTHING IS ORIGINAL IN THAT MOVIE
[6:06:37] <Halospaz117> Seems to be an issue with playing for a while, but all it takes is a restart

[6:06:40] <+RealThiele> nothing in star wars is original
[6:06:40] <Jaku2011> oh no
[6:06:40] <+krispen_wa> Not at all original
[6:06:41] <+Deadpal> NOT ORIGINAL.
[6:06:41] <+Taglog7> LUL
[6:06:41] <LeBlanc233> force bonds were in kotor 1
[6:06:42] <Graxe_> I see that we got back to the funky headgear
[6:06:42] <%Irridium> NOPE LUL
[6:06:43] <+Deano8817> I mean honestly, it's a fine idea why not
[6:06:43] <+SolidusRex> RIAN IS A HACK
[6:06:45] <Archmortal> A whole ton of shit in the new trilogy was taken from these games
[6:06:46] <Andrei11Droasca> NOPE
[6:06:48] <SnaKemuho> Bastilla was in KOTOR 1
[6:06:48] <CSeriesJTYPE> TLJ steals a lot from KOTOR2 tbh
[6:06:49] <worldbrand> force bonds imply force bondage
[6:06:50] <StarlitStunner> Theft
[6:06:52] <Amardeux> yikes atton
[6:06:53] <+doc_ock_rokc> Force bonds usually happen between two people who train eachother in the force
[6:06:53] <+kyh9> Every good idea in TLJ is ripped from this game
[6:06:54] <Archmortal> but done worse
[6:06:56] <coreyyotto> Come to think of it, I wonder if Kylo's shirtless look was a callback to Sion
[6:06:57] <%JetpackMcQuack> NotLikeThis
[6:06:58] <ZeeJiggle> Sleeps-With-Vibroblades is a great nickname.
[6:06:58] <subjectg> Disney trilogy borrows a LOT from kotor
[6:07:00] <+Deadpal> sleeps with vibrobaldes is real good.
[6:07:03] <siamzero94> star wars is too stupid for anything original
[6:07:04] <+SarcFa> you think any shit in disney trilogy is original
[6:07:04] <Tubnubbin> TLJ is like a cliffsnotes KOTOR2
[6:07:06] <availablethor> The new trilogy stole everything from KOTOR2. Everything.
[6:07:10] <Tennochief> The Father, Daughter and Son
[6:07:10] <+DigbyMayor> People bitched about the force bond when it was already a thing
[6:07:10] <+Winnosh> LUKE in the Books could teleport stuff.
[6:07:16] <%LiquidDinosaur> LiquidDinosaur subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! HOLY SHIT Woolie's playing Kotor 2, is he going evil or good?
[6:07:17] <+CptnCampy61> Wooow fuck rise of skywalker
[6:07:18] <TomFrank> cheech and chong did it first anyway
[6:07:22] <+DreyfussFrost> Why do you think Disney wiped the extended universe from canon before stealing all of its ideas?
[6:07:23] <+KamenRiderEbon> bruh why cant disney save star wars
[6:07:24] <alrobot2014> @LiquidDinosaur good
[6:07:26] <Magoloso> But that’s also why I did not get mad at the concept of Force Bonds like some people did.
[6:07:28] <+RealThiele> David Coppefield did it first
[6:07:31] <Safarihat> teleportation was a thing in the books lul
[6:07:31] <CocoonMoon> Thanks for the LuvSnooze @liquiddinosaur
[6:07:34] <+doc_ock_rokc> @DigbyMayor That is because usually its Very very hard to do a force bond
[6:07:34] <absolute_cagemony> ssssssshtar wars
[6:07:36] <+Ixek> Good @LiquidDinosaur , with the previous game having been Evil
[6:07:36] <%ozzrabbit> ...DAMMIT! That line didn’t help my imagination of Vibro Blades!
[6:07:37] <+Winnosh> Teeleporting stuff via the force was a thing in the books

[6:09:30] <StaceMcGate> Demolition is still garbage
[6:09:38] <+Ixek> @DatAsuna Wait, not Jedi Knight. Think that's from a Book tie in to the game.

[6:10:58] <+Ixek> @SolidusRex Hey man, I won't judge if you wanna fug an Astromech.
[6:11:10] <Jaku2011> Battlefront 2 just added an evil booper

[6:11:22] <+RealThiele> yea evil BB-8E, the E means evil
[6:11:22] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[6:11:47] <Hillthugsta> How is Handmaiden better than Disciple?
[6:11:50] <+doc_ock_rokc> BB8 was evil from the start
[6:11:53] <Kiari13> yeah but he still needs a gun LUL
[6:11:58] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @Hillthugsta waifus
[6:11:58] <clonexsniperx> or woolie can play t3 again and have unlimited power
[6:12:02] <subjectg> handmaiden’s story is more fleshed out, interesting
[6:12:03] <Tubnubbin> Better plot relevance @Hillthugsta
[6:12:05] <%DatAsuna> Swimming in weapons
[6:12:13] <%LiquidDinosaur> also god i love Atton. And how he's all "yah im the Han Solo snarky scoundrel guy" but its just a facade for his trauma from doing dank ass shit in a right wing death squad
[6:12:17] <coreyyotto> You're at Level 7 in the tutorial area, it's fine
[6:12:25] <+Ixek> Droids are always the best characters.
[6:12:34] <mihokspawn> @LiquidDinosaur its biological, and tattoos... the Darth Maul, nightsisters and the other red ones use rituals to get closer to the dark side
[6:12:34] <Kiari13> woolie NotLikeThis
[6:12:43] <privatesargent> Disciple has more plot relevance to MC's past, but handmaiden has a better storyline and character

[6:12:48] <Tennochief> LUL
[6:12:49] <Tubnubbin> @Hillthugsta more specifically, she's the protege of one of the game's main antagonists so she has more to do

[6:12:53] <Kiari13> wow it's almost like atton should have had a gun, thonking

[6:13:55] <+doc_ock_rokc> Man now that I think about it the two characters who got the largest shaft in starwars sequiles was Finn and BB8

[6:13:56] <+Ixek> Isn't there loot back near where you came in?
[6:13:56] <reonome> 12 episodes already LUL
[6:13:58] <StaceMcGate> Peragus is gonna be 11-12 episodes
[6:14:00] <subjectg> oh if you think peragus is going to take a while...
[6:14:04] <RedDragonMoth> 12-14 i guess
[6:14:13] <subjectg> just wait til we get off peragus
[6:14:14] <heartlesshealer> the new backpack

[6:14:20] <StaceMcGate> this is about a 40 hour iirc
[6:14:21] <+Ixek> Nice, surprised I remembered that.
[6:14:25] <mihokspawn> paragus just seems long... tis the second shortest
[6:14:30] <privatesargent> why they don't equip a primary and secondary weapon at the same time so this isn't a problem i don't know

[6:14:38] <siamzero94> boy onderon and nar shadaa will take ages
[6:14:46] <%LiquidDinosaur> Taris is more like Peragus+Telos
[6:14:48] <strayed42> Peragus is way better than Taris
[6:14:49] <Amardeux> cleaned up LUL
[6:14:51] <StarlitStunner> Turned my tribe into belts
[6:14:54] <Tennochief> and the Sand doggos

[6:14:57] <reonome> kill them all anakin
[6:14:59] <%that_Mojo_Izakku> all of them made for fine belts
[6:15:01] <Tennochief> and the Sand grandmas
[6:15:03] <subjectg> peragus is a better sequence, telos is debatable
[6:15:04] <snow_bush> Sand People are resistant to genocide it seems
[6:15:07] <+kaiju7544> LUL
[6:15:16] <Tennochief> and the Sand cousins too

[6:15:33] <%LiquidDinosaur> SMFH at pockets not having persuade
[6:15:36] <subjectg> Toughness is a good general purpose feat
[6:15:46] <%DatAsuna> @LiquidDinosaur V is a vet, all the basic hurdles are handled
[6:15:47] <privatesargent> he killed one tribe of sand people, there are probably hundreds of tribes across the planet
[6:15:51] <StaceMcGate> but persuasion Woolie
[6:15:56] <%LiquidDinosaur> Thank god.
[6:15:57] <HeroSolaire> good for cowards WeirdChamp

[6:16:02] <heartlesshealer> This is Fanny Pack
[6:16:04] <%LiquidDinosaur> I loved the Kotor LP but god it was painful
[6:16:15] <Kiari13> give atton a gun jermaSun
[6:16:20] <royb2> Kotor LP was so good
[6:16:21] <arkv01> time for some more uskan raider genocide

[6:16:34] <Cradlejack> is couch guy going to be in every episode?
[6:16:38] <%LiquidDinosaur> Atton might be good at tusken genocide
[6:16:41] <%LiquidDinosaur> he already did normal genocides
[6:16:46] <Kiari13> couch guy LUL
[6:16:46] <+CarlosEoM> get fucked droid
[6:17:00] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Woolie will be in every episode, yes
[6:17:05] <lotharrio> Double pistols out damage rifles 90% of the time. To the point where it's better to even make rifle users switch over even if you waste feats.
[6:17:07] <+SirGO0SE> stupid sexy couch guy
[6:17:08] <Kiari13> woolie just manually path
[6:17:13] <+Bluydee> I loved KOTOR 2 but I hate how ugly the jedi robes were

[6:17:27] <subjectg> if you are not in combat while disabling mines, you will take 20 on the roll
[6:17:30] <mihokspawn> of all the atks
[6:17:32] <HeroSolaire> @Bluydee there were some good robes
[6:17:33] <%DatAsuna> the only rifle to use is the heavy repeater fully specced to minmax power shot
[6:17:36] <CrabSlacks> jedi force droid lightning
[6:17:42] <Kiari13> @Bluydee i am the exact opposite, kotor 1's robes look so funky that i'm glad 2 has traditional robes LUL
[6:17:54] <%LiquidDinosaur> I still have nightmares about Pat telling Woolie to make Canderous keep using his blaster
[6:17:56] <%LiquidDinosaur> and not go melee
[6:18:03] <Psyramics> Why use force powers when you can be a lightsaber blender?
[6:18:05] <Tubnubbin> Kotor 2 robe variety > Kotor 1 red/blue/black bathrobes
[6:18:14] <%LiquidDinosaur> Psyramcis: why not both
[6:18:25] <Tennochief> @Psyramics so you can use those force powers to wield even more lightsabers
[6:18:25] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule

[6:19:19] <%DatAsuna> I told you V is solid
[6:19:23] <ZeeJiggle> Ok well I know what Planet 2 is gonna be now
[6:19:24] <Fatguy2> OOOO think was back when bioware was good
[6:19:26] <+RayDaug> I'll stock levels, that's a good trick
[6:19:31] <%LiquidDinosaur> Oh god i love this V guy
[6:19:32] <$TRILLTURBAN> Just let woolie have fun, we don't need to optimize this
[6:19:35] <Belutima> who is this woopsISee
[6:19:35] <+Deano8817> the level cap is 50, you can be lenient with the levels
[6:19:36] <Fatguy2> and they made d20 like game
[6:19:37] <subjectg> once again, obsidian, not bioware this time
[6:19:38] <ralphfromdk> Think like how you did in the first game, stayed like level 6 for a long time untill Jedi was unlocked
[6:19:38] <+Ixek> Wew. He ain't wrong.
[6:19:39] <Kiari13> make ALL companions prestiged it's way better
[6:19:43] <StaceMcGate> I'm ready to nominate V as best cohost
[6:19:48] <siamzero94> atton can get busted, not as much as handmaiden though
[6:19:50] <Jaku2011> V you are doing gods work for this LP
[6:19:50] <+bread_assassin> Alright
[6:19:50] <ZeeJiggle> V has the STRATS
[6:19:51] <+Deano8817> V is fuckin great tho
[6:19:54] <+Taglog7> Solid V
[6:19:57] <strayed42> kotor 2 is so easy who cares about optimising
[6:19:57] <+Bluydee> the dark side robes in this game look like the 2000s era baggy skater clothes
[6:20:03] <+alpharius88> LP SAVED!
[6:20:03] <+bread_assassin> Alright V really knows his shit.
[6:20:07] <GamerRider93> @Belutima Sup
[6:20:09] <giga_bit> V knows what's UP
[6:20:09] <ZeeJiggle> SICK
[6:20:09] <lotharrio> I half remember doing the math, but you generally want multiple weapon users to get the "heavy" attack skills because it will slightly out DPS most other options. Except when you have Jedi haste powers, those change things up.
[6:20:11] <therealtacopancakes> is atton carth 2?
[6:20:12] <ZeeJiggle> BEST LOOKIN ARMOR
[6:20:16] <+Ixek> HA
[6:20:18] <+bread_assassin> Keep Handmaiden at like 1.
[6:20:19] <Magoloso> V is fucking great
[6:20:24] <subjectg> it’s nice to stock levels but it isn’t strictly necessary
[6:20:28] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Oh nice, I skipped the entire tutorial arc.
[6:20:34] <%LiquidDinosaur> Woolie is going to fucking love Kreia
[6:20:46] <%LiquidDinosaur> Wait can i ask a lore question?
[6:20:48] <Badgerconda_> I'm a filthy casual, someone please tell me who this non-Pat Pat-figure is?
[6:20:53] <%LiquidDinosaur> Is it supposed to be implied that Sion raped Kreia?
[6:20:53] <Kiari13> sure :)
[6:20:53] <Cradlejack> The game is too easy for it to matter honestly even on the hardest difficulty
[6:20:57] <Jaku2011> yes Kreia alway in party
[6:20:58] <StaceMcGate> omg, I just realized Handmaiden is a short haired tomboy
[6:20:58] <Tennochief> Little V Mills
[6:21:02] <+gutlesscoward> what do you mean? it's pat
[6:21:07] <mihokspawn> What I hate in this game that the best heavy armor party member, can't wear armor
[6:21:08] <+katarjin> ..not using computer?\
[6:21:10] <%LiquidDinosaur> when she says she "suffered ......indignities." and its just a shot of Nihilus looking smug
[6:21:11] <Belutima> who is the person next to woolie woopsISee i know he had a special guest
[6:21:11] <subjectg> the only problem i foresee is that a lot of offensive powers also are restricted by armor
[6:21:13] <+Deano8817> @Badgerconda_ Little V Mills, youtube music guy
[6:21:17] <+M3NTH0L> This isn’t going to be the same without Pat being a smug know it all
[6:21:17] <Manwad> yo it's V Pog
[6:21:23] <Jimhalla> yo, that's V?
[6:21:25] <Belutima> ooj thats little V thats pretty cool
[6:21:26] <%LiquidDinosaur> like i always got that vibe but idk
[6:21:27] <+doc_ock_rokc> @Belutima Little V
[6:21:28] <Badgerconda_> @Deano8817 Thanks.
[6:21:33] <%SilvaChariot0133> LUL
[6:21:35] <+kaiju7544> Cartoonishly evil choices are the best choices
[6:21:35] <rumuloh> (empty) better loot it
[6:21:37] <Tennochief> TO KILL YOU
[6:21:41] <+MrRabbles> for a second i thought that noise was my computer actually getting ready to explode
[6:21:44] <Belutima> didn't recognise him when he wasn't singjng
[6:21:53] <Tubnubbin> Depends on how much you read into the "indignities," could also mean that he drained her of Force or something like that @LiquidDinosaur
[6:21:56] <mihokspawn> V .... that .... was .... painufl
[6:21:57] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @Belutima that's pretty good
[6:21:57] <StaceMcGate> Who will Woolie go for? Handmaiden or Visas
[6:22:06] <%startstoprepeat> they assume you're just showing off your lightning powers
[6:22:07] <Tubnubbin> But it's open to interpretation
[6:22:07] <Daxalog> Feels weird not seeing you jump over to people
[6:22:10] <Tennochief> LUL
[6:22:14] <+SolidusRex> @StaceMcGate Yes
[6:22:16] <Badgerconda_> Handmaiden for sure. She's got the short hair.
[6:22:17] <WanderingSwordsman> LUL
[6:22:18] <ralphfromdk> StaceMcGate Isn't that auto picked for your gender?
[6:22:19] <Cradlejack> I miss Pat
[6:22:21] <ZeeJiggle> Ye, we're not gonna be jumping to ppl, that's a Guardian only skill.
[6:22:24] <subjectg> to hit penalties are a bitch, ain’t it
[6:22:25] <siamzero94> @StaceMcGate handmaiden i would bet
[6:22:26] <+Bluydee> it can give off that impression but it’s inconsistent with Sion’s character imo
[6:22:30] <ZeeJiggle> tho that teleport earlier might say otherwise..
[6:22:36] <+Winnosh> looking forward to seeing the added content
[6:22:37] <rumuloh> God, so close to the end
[6:22:42] <Halospaz117> Aw darnit
[6:22:43] <StaceMcGate> @ralphfromdk you're thinking of handmaiden and disciple joining your party. I'm talking romance
[6:22:46] <+CyanDeadEye> Did they go Sentinel or Consular?
[6:22:50] <Heyestus> This game came out before Revenge of the Sith, they got the raving from this
[6:22:50] <Magoloso> wooliePOYO_BW
[6:22:52] <Tennochief> Sentinel
[6:22:53] <grouchio> King Crimson
[6:22:53] <Halospaz117> It's not too bad, just gotta exit the game and reload
[6:22:53] <rumuloh> Also is he going to fuck up the turret?
[6:22:57] <+QueequegTheater> Oh no, this glitch
[6:22:58] <giga_bit> RESTART THE GAME
[6:23:00] <Amardeux> oh boi LUL
[6:23:01] <Sapphire_Breeze> a game restart fixes it
[6:23:02] <HideousDeity> Save and reload.
[6:23:03] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Reload the save
[6:23:03] <ralphfromdk> StaceMcGate Oh yea, my bad... names :D
[6:23:03] <subjectg> might want to reload
[6:23:04] <%FuqBoiSlim> uh oh...
[6:23:04] <StaceMcGate> Restart the game
[6:23:05] <+SarcFa> save and reload?
[6:23:07] <Badgerconda_> Sentinel is seriously the patrician choice.
[6:23:07] <Halospaz117> @WoolieVersus Just exit and reload, then it will fix
[6:23:12] <Safarihat> all you have to do is reload its a memory leak issue
[6:23:13] <Fatguy2> what glitch?
[6:23:14] <nobknee> LITTLE V knows STARWARS?
[6:23:16] <+kaiju7544> Choosing dark side fixes lol
[6:23:22] <Hillthugsta> Mira is a jack of all trades
[6:23:22] <heartlesshealer> that's way too damn jarring
[6:23:23] <Obelusk_> it'll keep happening until you turn the game off and back on
[6:23:23] <+QueequegTheater> @Fatguy2 DIalogue is skipping automatically
[6:23:24] <ZeeJiggle> I forget if this game has a log for all the conversations, just in case it passes by multiple lines?
[6:23:24] <giga_bit> @WoolieVersus Memory leak issue, reload and it'll be fixed
[6:23:26] <$TRILLTURBAN> Can someone tell Woolie to go to the Journal if he wants to get dialogue he skipped?
[6:23:30] <+SolidusRex> Exit and reload will fix it
[6:23:34] <FennecZephyr> Save and reopen the game, yes
[6:23:37] <siamzero94> @Fatguy2 none of Atton's dialouge triggered
[6:23:37] <jorniev> man i forgot about the engenier party member he is a cool looking dude
[6:23:38] <Tubnubbin> Funny how Woolie is trying to pick the Light/Dark side options when there's a character who literally chides you for it LUL
[6:23:41] <Fatguy2> o
[6:23:41] <wahilliham> SAVE FIRST
[6:23:49] <coreyyotto> So probably exit and reload during bathroom breaks.
[6:23:49] <Magoloso> Save
[6:23:55] <ralphfromdk> So, has Woolie talked about what kinda of weapons he will run this time. 2 sabers again, or something new?
[6:24:01] <giga_bit> YEAH DID YOU SEE THAT SHIT
[6:24:03] <SolSwagGuy56> Star Wars rap is lit
[6:24:05] <heartlesshealer> Record Progress
[6:24:08] <ZeeJiggle> I feel like it'll eventually fix itself but a guaranteed fix is to just restart the game.
[6:24:10] <CuttleCrow> more where that came from
[6:24:17] <reonome> bzzzzt
[6:24:17] <ZeeJiggle> Time to even the odds
[6:24:20] <+QueequegTheater> MORE WHERE THAT CAME FROM
[6:24:22] <nobknee> You can set a combat precept.
[6:24:24] <siamzero94> more where that came from
[6:24:30] <+kaiju7544> Obi-wan would never bother, telling you about your father...
[6:24:30] <$TRILLTURBAN> If Woolie wants to see dialogue that was skipped he can go look in the Journal on the pause menu
[6:24:33] <ZeeJiggle> AUUH
[6:24:33] <mihokspawn> More where that came from
[6:24:35] <Sphincter_Spelunker> I think that enemy got... the point
[6:24:38] <subjectg> pausing and stacking actions helps
[6:24:45] <+kaiju7544> He told me enough! He told me you killed him!
[6:24:49] <nobknee> He
[6:24:53] <+QueequegTheater> I think that enemy got...the point
[6:25:01] <nobknee> He's on PC with the mod?

[6:26:36] <heartlesshealer> "I love explosions!"
[6:26:36] <supttersage> Red army tactics
[6:26:37] <availablethor> Atton "disabled" the mines.

[6:27:48] <Amardeux> LUL
[6:27:48] <+lutefiiisk> How long has he been going?
[6:27:49] <privatesargent> Gandalf crossclassed
[6:27:53] <+CarlosEoM> LUL
[6:27:53] <siamzero94> But Jedi's are wizards
[6:27:56] <%SilvaChariot0133> ...oh wait, RDM is a thing
[6:27:57] <Explodincatz> thats the best part
[6:27:57] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus That's because Gandalf isn't a mage, he's a fighter who classed into a couple spells
[6:27:58] <Cradlejack> This backseat gaming is killing completely ruining the experience Woolie is fully capable of playing the game himself and he is robbing himself of one of the best RPG's ever... can't watch anymore PEACE
[6:28:00] <%DatAsuna> Greta van Woolsworth
[6:28:02] <+thebonebard> wizards still rarely seem to use swords
[6:28:03] <%DatAsuna> HOW DARE YOU
[6:28:04] <nobknee> Gandalf does what he do.
[6:28:04] <zayasu> @lutefiiisk 6 hours
[6:28:04] <%LiquidDinosaur> GANDALF IS NOT A WIZARD HE'S JUST A FIGHTER WITH MAGIC INITIATE
[6:28:05] <Heyestus> what kinda pussy wizard can't hit things with sharp bit of metal?
[6:28:05] <+katarjin> Battlemage is my jam, loved AW in Dragon age
[6:28:06] <+fugatlas> wizards always carry weopons. Sometimes shit don't work
[6:28:09] <+doc_ock_rokc> Gandalf is an angel though so he can do what he wants
[6:28:09] <%Double_Tap_That> Gandalf obviously multiclaeed
[6:28:10] <Ultimatefool> Gandalf split his stat points
[6:28:10] <Fujiwara_92> gandalf was 19 wiz/ 1 fighter
[6:28:12] <subjectg> Gandalf magic be mostly cantrips anyway
[6:28:12] <ralphfromdk> Technically Gandalf is not a wizard, but an actual angel.
[6:28:13] <+Winnosh> Gandalf Dual wielded Sword and Staff
[6:28:14] <+308caliber> Gandalf is secretly a fighter
[6:28:14] <coreyyotto> possibly of the fart variety
[6:28:17] <reonome> @Cradlejack is this your first time watching an LP lol
[6:28:19] <heartlesshealer> Gandalf was a RedMage
[6:28:19] <Hillthugsta> are Rifles classified as two-hand or single hand?
[6:28:20] <+lutefiiisk> I fell asleep during the intro. What can ya do?
[6:28:21] <+Taglog7> fart gas obligatory
[6:28:21] <%LiquidDinosaur> THE ONLY MAGIC SHIT HE DOES IS LIGHT PINECONES ON FIRE, MAKE HIS STAFF GLOW, AND THROW HIS VOICE
[6:28:23] <therealtacopancakes> You don't tell gandalf what he can and can't use Woolie
[6:28:24] <Badgerconda_> Gandalf is Odin, he should have had a spear.
[6:28:25] <Magoloso> FARTGAAAAAAS
[6:28:27] <StaceMcGate> Has Woolie ever played Divinity 1 or 2?
[6:28:29] <alexandrecau> hack
[6:28:30] <Ashenik1> Honestly soft magic is better than complicatd Naruto magic ;d
[6:28:35] <Cradlejack> @reonome no
[6:28:38] <+308caliber> he dresses in wizard clothes to fool his enemies
[6:28:40] <mihokspawn> AAAAnd you have T3
[6:28:41] <%LiquidDinosaur> and yeah Gandalf is a literal angel he can do ehat he wants
[6:28:47] <Magoloso> Bring back FARTGAS
[6:28:49] <Psyramics> "Everyone else" You mean Atton, who gets back up after he dies?
[6:28:49] <SnaKemuho> @Cradlejack at least V knows the game, unlike some other backseater Keepo
[6:29:01] <+CyanDeadEye> SAVE
[6:29:03] <lotharrio> Way to go kid, now let's wrap it up and head home!
[6:29:05] <+primax104> more like a de-leveled angel, but the point still stands
[6:29:08] <$TRILLTURBAN> Oh boy just wait until Telos
[6:29:08] <%LiquidDinosaur> hell technically he could probably look like a blue+white balrog, but the Wizards agreed to obey Prime Directive
[6:29:11] <Andrei11Droasca> Id play a Platinum game with Gandalf as a main character
[6:29:12] <reonome> @Cradlejack weird thing to get mad about then
[6:29:12] <+bread_assassin> Gandalf multi-classed.
[6:29:13] <%DatAsuna> Not in the LP
[6:29:14] <+Deano8817> !uptime
[6:29:14] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 6 hours and 29 minutes
[6:29:17] <+Deano8817> HMMM
[6:29:19] <%DatAsuna> LP Taris was 10 hours
[6:29:22] <Yaddabluh> man V calm down, you keep repeating yourself over and over
[6:29:27] <StaceMcGate> This is very easily gonna be a 70+ series
[6:29:30] <Ashenik1> And almost no characters to interact with
[6:29:31] <Sphincter_Spelunker> see what I mean?
[6:29:34] <Cradlejack> @reonome how so?
[6:29:35] <Sphincter_Spelunker> perfect
[6:29:35] <siamzero94> Well let's so how Telos goes
[6:29:37] <heartlesshealer> just pop some tech into Atton's eyeball
[6:29:41] <supttersage> loot suburb
[6:29:42] <heartlesshealer> IMPLANTS!
[6:29:48] <+Gamingand808s> ebon hawk
[6:29:52] <holistically> @yaddabluh for people like me thats useful do :P
[6:30:07] <+katarjin> MF is nopt my fav at all
[6:30:08] <Tennochief> E-Bohn= Ebon
[6:30:11] <Heyestus> the falcon's been abused too
[6:30:11] <+Ixek> I highly prefer the Ebonhawk to the Millenium Falcon.
[6:30:17] <StaceMcGate> ONE GUY
[6:30:25] <+humbelpie> i just arrived is that Little V Mills?
[6:30:25] <+Ixek> There's jermaOneguy in here.
[6:30:28] <Dangerzone979> I always thought the Falcon looked ugly as sin
[6:30:34] <reonome> @Cradlejack lps are generally better with someone who knows the game, if you want woolie to play kotor by himself he wouldn't be LPing it
[6:30:34] <+katarjin> loot tah Gluten
[6:30:34] <+QueequegTheater> Yeah you get him, Atton
[6:30:35] <+Winnosh> Yep is Lil V
[6:30:39] <+humbelpie> oh nice
[6:30:43] <Tennochief> oh no
[6:30:49] <%SilvaChariot0133> lytLEERY
[6:30:51] <%LiquidDinosaur> will V tell him to not kill a single guy in the turret sequence?
[6:30:51] <+IxDomxI> lytLEERY oh no
[6:30:52] <reonome> oh no
[6:30:55] <%that_Mojo_Izakku> oh YEAH
[6:30:56] <PlumpPotatoRump> i remember that pathing fking me up lool
[6:30:58] <subjectg> i prefer the hawk because the cockpit isn’t in an awkward position
[6:31:04] <lotharrio> So the reason it's okay to enslave, murder and torture droids is 100% because the Force exists, right?
[6:31:07] <availablethor> Critmore Stunman
[6:31:14] <Cradlejack> @reonome That couldn't be farther from the truth all the LPers i watch do so solo
[6:31:14] <+humbelpie> i hope when the LP is over Little V Mills does a epic heavy metal recap of the entire LP
[6:31:18] <+primax104> hall wuggin'
[6:31:19] <zecaptain_james> PowerUpL the8bitOwO PowerUpR
[6:31:23] <Hillthugsta> are rifles classified as 2 hand or one hand?
[6:31:26] <Magoloso> Save before the hawk in case of the dialogue glitch!
[6:31:31] <Tennochief> 2 hand
[6:31:34] <+WeepProphet> still on the ship
[6:31:34] <reonome> @Cradlejack so why are you watching woolie??
[6:31:37] <heartlesshealer> SAVE BEFORE SHIP
[6:31:38] <mihokspawn> @Hillthugsta 2 hands
[6:31:41] <subjectg> Rifles do not get benefits from feats
[6:31:44] <%LiquidDinosaur> Oh hey, someone remind me, what is the cause of the glitch where Bao-Dur never talks to you ever again?
[6:31:45] <+QueequegTheater> @Cradlejack Blind LPs have consistently been the worst, slowest absolute slogs on WoolieVS and SBFP
[6:32:00] <subjectg> so dual pistols or single pistols work better for the most part
[6:32:03] <%LiquidDinosaur> @QueequegTheater Thaaaats an aaaaaaaaaaaaalien
[6:32:08] <+thebonebard> melt your bits back together
[6:32:09] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @Cradlejack Woolie's origins are from the channel "SuperBestFriendsplay" Different strokes, my guy
[6:32:21] <Cradlejack> I am well aware lol
[6:32:22] <%LiquidDinosaur> F for SBFP
[6:32:29] <mihokspawn> @subjectg single is more survivable, because of duelist, dual is nukalage
[6:32:31] <+QueequegTheater> Know what I mean
[6:32:31] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[6:32:32] <reonome> whats sbfp Kappa
[6:32:32] <+Ixek> @LiquidDinosaur Was there a cause? I always thought it just randomly happened. I never noticed a consistency in it.
[6:32:34] <Tubnubbin> I believe it stands for "friends"
[6:32:41] <StaceMcGate> The final series of SBFP was woolie and matt failing KH in a spectacular fashion
[6:32:41] <+QueequegTheater> Know what I mean?
[6:32:45] <+QueequegTheater> Know what I mean.
[6:32:45] <heartlesshealer> DMC5 though, @QueequegTheater. (I'm not counting Pat jumping ahead of Woolie like the goblin man he is)
[6:32:47] <reonome> f is for friends who do stuff together
[6:32:50] <subjectg> @mihokspawn rapid shot + speed is the best
[6:32:51] <SaturnianOcean> Perfect
[6:33:02] <Tennochief> @StaceMcGate no, the true finale was panty fighters
[6:33:07] <mihokspawn> @subjectg aaaallll the DAKKKA
[6:33:08] <+theman515> !uptime

[6:33:12] <+theman515> damn son
[6:33:16] <StaceMcGate> DMC 5 was the best LP
[6:33:24] <Halospaz117> It will cut through all of it, save and reload the game
[6:33:26] <+QueequegTheater> @heartlesshealer Considering the hundreds of hours Woolie and Pat have played the other games I barely consider that blind
[6:33:32] <+Gamingand808s> baby yoda awaits
[6:33:35] <Cradlejack> Anyway not my bag enjoy you guys i'll check out what Woolie is doing after this way to cringe for me personally

[6:33:45] <subjectg> Oh boy here comes the carnage
[6:33:48] <arkv01> waiting for more WIZARDRY
[6:33:49] <giga_bit> It'll totally cut through all the dialogue
[6:33:50] <+TheOneCalledRock> @Cradlejack also you say "let him enjoy the game" without considering that he wants to enjoy it this way
[6:33:52] <Magoloso> If it happens quit and reopen
[6:33:53] <Sphincter_Spelunker> What does Faust do in Trickster is a Woolie. Not using Faust at all was a Pat
[6:33:53] <%LiquidDinosaur> oh what class is Woolie?
[6:33:56] <StarlitStunner> Space Wizard
[6:33:59] <heartlesshealer> @QueequegTheater Fair, but it was the blindest it could have ever been for a Vergil-loving Woolie

[6:45:18] <StaceMcGate> Again, this is an Obsidian game
[6:45:19] <CuttleCrow> ✂
[6:45:20] <+QueequegTheater> @LiquidDinosaur That's a huge bug, you get that for dancing for a Hutt in a stripper outfit as a FeMC
[6:45:20] <+valiard> Woow still going?
[6:45:21] <rosabellamelantha> RELAUNCH
[6:45:21] <Halospaz117> Exiting the game is required
[6:45:22] <+PleasantLeech> time for a judgment cut
[6:45:24] <Safarihat> @WoolieVersus you need to relaunch the game
[6:45:25] <availablethor> You need to relaunch.
[6:45:27] <%JetpackMcQuack> One guy Jebaited
[6:45:27] <subjectg> you need to quit the game
[6:45:27] <+SarcFa> relaunch
[6:45:28] <SaturnianOcean> Just relaunch
[6:45:29] <%foreverN2dust> psa1guy maybe
[6:45:29] <StaceMcGate> just relaunch
[6:45:29] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Just restart the game
[6:45:30] <Fujiwara_92> You gotta relaunch
[6:45:30] <rosabellamelantha> @WoolieVersus you have to relaunch the game

[6:45:33] <aeravon> Quit the game and relaunch
[6:45:35] <lotharrio> @WoolieVersus It will probably keep happening. Sorry.
[6:45:35] <strayed42> RELAUNCH
[6:45:36] <Kiari13> relaunch and reload the one you did in teh ship
[6:45:37] <wahilliham> any save but you need to relaunch
[6:45:38] <ZeeJiggle> Just a game restart will fix it.
[6:45:41] <SnaKemuho> it's a memory leak so you gotta relaunch
[6:45:44] <Halospaz117> Reloading any save should be fine
[6:45:44] <Andrei11Droasca> @forevern2dust this is Obsidian
[6:45:45] <Frosty_Edge> Have you tried turning it off and back on again
[6:45:46] <heartlesshealer> Yeah, just cut and fix it
[6:45:46] <StaceMcGate> PLEASE STAND BY
[6:45:48] <CrabSlacks> this bug is so annoying :(
[6:45:51] <SnaKemuho> maybe even relaunch every couple of hours
[6:45:53] <+Deano8817> this'll happen a lot :)
[6:45:53] <privatesargent> old and BUGGY game
[6:45:55] <+QueequegTheater> Totally

[6:45:56] <subjectg> memory leaks man
[6:45:56] <holistically> you missed dialogue earlier too but meh

[6:46:02] <%medinaj1990> Perfectly optimize. No bugs 100%
[6:46:04] <Magoloso> JUDGEMENT CUT: END
[6:46:06] <Archmortal> They definitely didn't find like 20% of the game files at the end totally unused
[6:46:06] <Halospaz117> This issue seems to come from playing a single session for an extended amount of time, think it's memory leak
[6:46:08] <ZeeJiggle> I believe this is a bug specific to the PC version as well.
[6:46:09] <StaceMcGate> @WoolieVersus are you going to serenade us?
[6:46:10] <+vaporousTippler> These bugs are all ok. It shipped before Christmas 15 years ago!
[6:46:10] <CrabSlacks> a perfect monolith of a game
[6:46:11] <+QueequegTheater> Just like how New Vegas wasn't buggy and unfinished either

[6:46:49] <Halospaz117> @WoolieVersus The dialogue skipping seems to be from memory leak from playing a session for too long, so you'll likely run into it a bit this playthrough

[6:59:48] <+QueequegTheater> Sisko with Beard is my favorite Darth
[6:59:50] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Out the Airlock with you, Atton
[6:59:51] <subjectg> @razielhex i know that, just for the sake of consistency
[6:59:52] <Joestar1890> Farth
[6:59:54] <SaturnianOcean> Darth Barth
[6:59:54] <supttersage> Darth Rand
[6:59:55] <+MrRabbles> Fann will remember that
[6:59:57] <lotharrio> Droids don't get access to space magic. EVER. Literally worse than second class citizens!
[6:59:58] <+PleasantLeech> Chad T3 vs virgin Barth
[7:00:00] <Tennochief> hey lay off of Darth
[7:00:01] <@Solidus_113> Garth
[7:00:03] <Daxalog> EARTH!?
[7:00:05] <DJR33DY> All aboard the T3 hype train
[7:00:05] <+QueequegTheater> Darth Barth, the Earth Carth
[7:00:08] <%FuqBoiSlim> Zarth
[7:00:08] <+bigbuglittlejug> the darth carth game would be something for sure
[7:00:09] <Kiari13> darth you say :)
[7:00:10] <Graxe_> Carth, Darth, Earth, Farth, Garth
[7:00:11] <VJdarkworld> sensei :O
[7:00:16] <Turlupus> Are you using the mod that puts in cut content?
[7:00:21] <StaceMcGate> You are now my kouhai
[7:00:21] <+razielhex> Lord Scourge biding his time right now, folding his arms together, just fukken waitin' to kill this man.
[7:00:24] <@Solidus_113> Marth
[7:00:24] <+thebonebard> oh man if only we had a teacher
[7:00:25] <Graxe_> Pick your demotion
[7:00:25] <+QueequegTheater> Oh man, Woolie is gonna LOVE some of the T3 stuff in this game
[7:00:31] <grouchio> Harth Iarth Jarth Karth Larth Marth ETHER
[7:00:31] <Kiari13> @razielhex LUL
[7:00:42] <+QueequegTheater> Can't we just run away
[7:00:42] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[7:00:47] <+miyoles> are they using the mod with the extra cut content?
[7:00:50] <@Solidus_113> yes
[7:00:53] <+QueequegTheater> @grouchio >Marth
[7:00:57] <Sphincter_Spelunker> scold me, granny
[7:00:59] <+razielhex> Sleheyron content?
[7:01:01] <+QueequegTheater> DAMN IT WILL THE FIRE EMBLEM CHARACTERS NEVER END
[7:01:06] <CrabSlacks> this is a TURN BASED field of battle!
[7:01:09] <+thebonebard> listen to this trailer shot
[7:01:19] <rosabellamelantha> No she's just giving you advice
[7:01:25] <StaceMcGate> Ain't no getting off this train!
[7:01:27] <alrobot2014> if you commit, you will never stop going in
[7:01:30] <siamzero94> Atton for smash confirmed?
[7:01:35] <SuperFightinRobot> Jarth is a prolific writer in the Elder Scrolls series.
[7:01:37] <CuttleCrow> look at all those CHOICES
[7:01:50] <DJR33DY> I hear you Kreia, but have you considered...The Back Down
[7:01:58] <Safarihat> the dialogue in this game is Great
[7:02:00] <+razielhex> you really should put down the cockpit blinders on the transparisteel bridge because in Star Wars you can go lovecraftian insane by staring deep into hyperspace for long periods of time.
[7:02:02] <subjectg> remember, don’t be afraid to be honest with your choice
[7:02:02] <Tennochief> no u
[7:02:02] <SaturnianOcean> Kreia's voice is so cool
[7:02:03] <%FuqBoiSlim> I Fann Y'Pak solemnly swear to my peers and family I will never stop going in
[7:02:07] <+GeneralHysterics> Kreia's an og
[7:02:08] <%TRILLTURBAN> Man every time I see this game's dialogue choices all I can think of is Fallout 4
[7:02:13] <Sedrelic> eat shit..kill her
[7:02:21] <Apolonm> I love her
[7:02:21] <%SilvaChariot0133> psaDab
[7:02:21] <+QueequegTheater> "Can't we just back down"
[7:02:22] <siamzero94> Silly boy and your optimism
[7:02:25] <Tennochief> so just Atton
[7:02:25] <+bokutachi_san> She is the best
[7:02:25] <CuttleCrow> yes, yes(maybe), no(yes), yes(snarky)
[7:02:26] <Deadbulky> Savage
[7:02:26] <+supaXmugen> kreia doesnt buy that dumb Jedi shit
[7:02:27] <StaceMcGate> b-baka

[7:02:32] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Kreia's the best
[7:02:39] <+QueequegTheater> Their SUPER isn't
[7:02:39] <Sphincter_Spelunker> well...
[7:02:40] <Kiari13> small number
[7:02:41] <rosabellamelantha> That's not the point
[7:02:43] <+QueequegTheater> &there
[7:02:44] <+bokutachi_san> ya it's a shame
[7:02:46] <+QueequegTheater> **
[7:02:52] <Tubnubbin> It's worth it if you ignore the "videogame" parts
[7:02:53] <subjectg> that’s really not the point
[7:02:56] <rosabellamelantha> Being Grey is REALLY not the point here
[7:02:59] <Tubnubbin> And just care about story
[7:03:04] <ZeeJiggle> Light in this game does lean more towards "sensible" instead of "angel".
[7:03:05] <arkv01> grey is for cowards, go full dark
[7:03:08] <thealientrilogy> YOU CAN
[7:03:10] <Halospaz117> Yeah, I pretty much play pragmatic good, a decent person, but made cynical by their experiences
[7:03:11] <Deadbulky> Just rp itnerds
[7:03:11] <Joestar1890> GREY BOYS
[7:03:12] <+GeneralHysterics> THE LONG HAUL
[7:03:17] <FeralRageGaming> in my personal case, "Im a good guy, but i wanna shoot lightning out of my hand."
[7:03:17] <CrabSlacks> I always try to play as good grey, never say you're a jedi
[7:03:19] <Kiari13> flesh :)
[7:03:21] <privatesargent> you are going to enjoy Kreia Woolie

[7:03:36] <Fujiwara_92> jolee
[7:03:37] <+bread_assassin> You get bonus's for 100% one way or another, I guess being gray means no penalties to casting force powers.
[7:03:37] <goose_attack_almanac> Woolee Bindo
[7:03:37] <Joestar1890> Jolee Jr.
[7:03:37] <+ChrisAlgoo> then greyboy
[7:03:38] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Jolee's bastard
[7:03:42] <mihokspawn> Joleeeen
[7:03:43] <+razielhex> @WoolieVersus In Star Wars, there's a condition called "Hyper Rapture" that drives people insane to like "Event Horizon" levels when they stare at hyperspace for too long; most ships have blinders when they skip into hyperspace.
[7:03:44] <rosabellamelantha> the thing with Jolee though is he was still a GOOD PERSON
[7:03:45] <Badgerconda_> big woolie bindo
[7:03:58] <+QueequegTheater> I love Atton
[7:03:59] <Orbeii> shut up, atton 😡

[7:04:14] <Valentinius_Anodyne> How curious
[7:04:14] <Rangenade> joe biden is a grey jedi?!
[7:04:19] <privatesargent> he seems to be really senstiive to peoples feelings, almost like he is force sensitive
[7:04:19] <+thebonebard> hes not
[7:04:25] <StaceMcGate> GOOD BOY POINTS
[7:04:26] <+thebonebard> people just want to think he is
[7:04:29] <trickquestionz> And Vader loves staring into hyperspace, he does it all the time on his big flagships
[7:04:30] <Badgerconda_> No, Joe Biden is a sith.
[7:04:33] <Joestar1890> Good boy run

[7:04:59] <siamzero94> jedis are the worst
[7:05:00] <+razielhex> @trickquestionz He probably doesn't view it with his raw eyes, but through his helmet?
[7:05:01] <Tucker0603> LIGHTSIDE SITH ALL THE WAY AY
[7:05:01] <giga_bit> Oh Woolie is going to love this shit.

[7:05:06] <atin2000> I cant wait for the literal pillar of light up the ass from max light side
[7:05:06] <Joestar1890> Qui-Gon wasn't snooty
[7:05:10] <Mr__Jebus> From my point of view, the jedi are evil
[7:05:11] <trickquestionz> also, I forgot how fucking good the “call to war” speech was here
[7:05:12] <+Ixek> Don't forget Medium Armor.
[7:05:16] <CruxAustralis> @WoolieVersus but you gotta do Charisma for the sweet charming
[7:05:20] <+Crankypancake> I'll try it one more time; who's on the couch with Woolie? Does he have a YT channel?

[7:08:02] <jorniev> still wanted him to be called POUCHES
[7:08:03] <Halospaz117> But those are unfortunately a reality of playing this game
[7:08:04] <OldManDeckardCain> without V this would take 2 streams LUL
[7:08:12] <%DatAsuna> Good stream~
[7:08:14] <Pechugaman> Ypu better romance Brianna you chucklefucks
[7:08:14] <grouchio> When will we see you again dear V?

[7:08:34] <Magoloso> GG guys. That was super cool
[7:08:34] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @jorniev I mean, what is a Fanny Pack if not a pouch?
[7:08:38] <%LiquidDinosaur> what happens to T3
[7:08:42] <trickquestionz> You can go corporate sellout next planet and still get the good parts of the ending.
[7:08:42] <Fujiwara_92> V guiding woolz hips looking good
[7:08:44] <grouchio> Little V for a podcast guest!
[7:08:53] <ZeeJiggle> Good first sesh getting passed the tutorial. No seriously.
[7:08:55] <Halospaz117> Yeah, clearing Peragus in one go is a nice start
[7:08:58] <%DatAsuna> based V
[7:08:59] <Hillthugsta> Mira.for lyfe
[7:09:00] <Andrei11Droasca> @woolieversus God job ,that was one of the worst areas in the game SeemsGood
[7:09:06] <+MrMoonGoose> @valentinius_anodyne almost a pocket, one might say
[7:09:08] <%RioGascar> little V is great and I wanna see more after this kotor 2 lp
[7:09:08] <+theman515> Great stream Woolie, you two are looking great. tweet out those concert dates and locations!
[7:09:18] <Halospaz117> I honestly have a soft spot for Peragus, I love the almost horror-ish atmosphere
[7:09:19] <mihokspawn> @WoolieVersus how did you like the worst part of KOTOR2?
[7:09:20] <notenoughgirls> the revan novel never happened
[7:09:24] <lotharrio> Sarcafa?
[7:09:25] <KatabolicRage> I think you can see why people use skip mods for that segment on subsequent playthroughs
[7:09:25] <%startstoprepeat> also v's patience steering woolie around is a refreshing change
[7:09:29] <Kiari13> jermaVenus
[7:09:29] <+QueequegTheater> Do Master of Puppets
[7:09:30] <+SirGO0SE> SourPls
[7:09:32] <KatabolicRage> it's so lengthy
[7:09:36] <Belutima> SingsNote ~ woopsOwo ~
[7:09:38] <Pechugaman> I think you will enjoy this one pretty much.
[7:09:41] <BlueMoonBlues> Serenade us, V
[7:09:42] <%Irridium> that was a pokemon tune
[7:09:42] <jorniev> mart
[7:09:44] <%OldManJEWc> OldManJEWc subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[7:09:45] <+gonerampant> At least you can now skip Peragus in all future playthroughs!
[7:09:46] <mexicansunglasses> Even unfinished it's still above Kotor1.
[7:09:48] <Daba_mk2> it sure is
[7:09:57] <Kiari13> DON'T DO IT @WoolieVersus
[7:10:00] <Kiari13> ITS BORING
[7:10:00] <Halospaz117> NOOOOO
[7:10:01] <SaturnianOcean> It's not very good
[7:10:02] <%TRILLTURBAN> Was underwhelming tbh
[7:10:04] <Halospaz117> BAD MOD
[7:10:07] <%TRILLTURBAN> Also a lil buggy
[7:10:18] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Little V play that pokemon song about mpreg
[7:10:19] <SaturnianOcean> Super long hallways with nothing in them
[7:10:21] <Pechugaman> That planet is horrible
[7:10:21] <Kiari13> it is ABSOLUTELY not worth
[7:10:24] <Andrei11Droasca> Iea ,very buggi
[7:10:28] <Daba_mk2> is for super fans that already play the game
[7:10:29] <%DatAsuna> Play it at home, it's interesting in a minor behind the scenes way if only for how the 4th macguffin was different
[7:10:33] <Halospaz117> Basically it sounds like everything wrong with Peragus turned up to 11
[7:10:36] <TDAWS_MP132> Yep
[7:10:38] <SgtPepper5e> its worse
[7:10:40] <%DatAsuna> But don't stream it
[7:10:41] <%LiquidDinosaur> Trayus Academy and its endless hallways of goons?
[7:10:44] <Ashenik1> I almost quit the game cause this planet....
[7:10:44] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Its way worse than that
[7:10:45] <+razielhex> Sleheyron is a planet in Hutt Space; a mining colony for slaves.
[7:10:45] <Halospaz117> Oh yeah that one part is a little ehhhhhh
[7:10:46] <trickquestionz> Sometimes stuff is meant to get cut
[7:10:50] <+Gamingand808s> malacor 5
[7:10:53] <Joestar1890> Is it the factory?
[7:10:54] <%TRILLTURBAN> Look it up on a wiki if you're interested, it's an interesting idea
[7:10:58] <Halospaz117> I think they mean the factory
[7:11:01] <Halospaz117> Not saying more
[7:11:05] <ZeeJiggle> Maybe a little bit of Toggle Headgear
[7:11:07] <Halospaz117> Cuz spoilers
[7:11:07] <Belutima> why would you change content woopsHmm
[7:11:11] <alrobot2014> @WoolieVersus since we had the dialogue skip bug today, be careful when we get to the last planet. i've personally had big dialogue skips happen there over huge plot dumps

[7:11:27] <Breakfast_Megapowers> Breakfast_Megapowers subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! Hey Woolz. Glad to catch you at the end of your stream, keep it up. Also happy to hear that you also had a Soda Hustle in School, unlike yours my school had Vending machines but they sold Cokes for $1.50 while I sold Dr.Peppers and Pepsis for .75cents
[7:11:33] <Sedrelic> Fuck it : nude hk mods
[7:11:34] <%startstoprepeat> since people were saying the dialogue stuff was memory leak issues, maybe be careful installing more stuff on top of everything else
[7:11:42] <Halospaz117> There's also a mod that makes head equipment invisible if you think it looks too dumb

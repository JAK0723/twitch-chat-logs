[0:32:29] <@Menitta> Lmao
[0:32:29] <ArbyDMC> hey now
[0:32:30] <tigerfang86> French Maid Minh
[0:32:35] <DrBeanie> lmao
[0:32:46] <Bleack114> is Reggie volunteering as a maid?
[0:32:55] <%Lion_kun> I was pulling your leg woolie, you're awesome
[0:33:11] <MagumaDono> Alright Woolie
[0:33:13] <MagumaDono> It's LATIGO time
[0:33:17] <%Aussie_Manny> wooliePOYO
[0:33:21] <Tampaoster> puyo
[0:33:21] <%derrickslays> FASTING
[0:33:31] <MagumaDono> GOOD
[0:33:50] <+SashaStarshine> What's LATIGO?
[0:33:51] <MagumaDono> Yeah that combo mix does require some extra resources
[0:33:54] <%sileo_patronus> Woolie waiting for sci-fi nutrient blocks
[0:34:01] <+theAncopro> Will Frieza stop the evil Goku? Find out this time on FuckDharZ
[0:34:02] <MagumaDono> But even still, just the Level 2 buff alone is godly.
[0:34:17] <MagumaDono> Come talk to me Reggie,
[0:34:20] <%Order_of_Mystery> Wait... where's little light-up Kirby? Big Kirby, where is your son!?
[0:34:29] <MagumaDono> Tell me the Latigo talk.
[0:34:33] <Zebroneath> Tech resolutions in front of a live studio audience
[0:34:36] <EndgameContent> Latigo is a boss killer, you don't want to burn him on mooks
[0:34:45] <%ozzrabbit> @magumadono they also mentioned that MikeZ added an extra digit because of your 999 combo video.
[0:34:52] <EndgameContent> Also, if you get good at juggling, you build meter way faster
[0:34:52] <MagumaDono> That is correct @ozzrabbit
[0:35:01] <Taco_Salsaguy> I like seeing this. Watching the recording process is interesting.
[0:35:09] <EndgameContent> Woolie has a habit of launching someone and then continuing the combo once they hit the ground
[0:35:21] <hoenhime344> i need a kirby kigarumi
[0:35:21] <EndgameContent> Biggest tip is just to get better at juggling so you can rotate his supers faster.
[0:35:23] <MagumaDono> So, like, max output with Latigo. Getting his Level 2 ASAP works best. And then you just keep him for combo ending. Juggle all the time
[0:35:27] <%sileo_patronus> Just level 2 is good enough for anything that doesn't have big boss health
[0:35:31] <MagumaDono> Juggle constantly and use characters who are perfect batteries
[0:35:39] <stanlychicken> Woolie is currently wearing kirby as a skinsuit
[0:35:40] <Zebroneath> Also, Titanfall 2 went from 2.5k to 15k population on PS4 after becoming free for 2 hours.
[0:35:40] <Tampaoster> what game?
[0:35:52] <EndgameContent> You're about to get an Iddhi battery
[0:35:52] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:36:05] <hoenhime344> titanfall 2 is free?
[0:36:08] <HolisticField> theres a character later on whose up atk literally does nothing but generate iddhi
[0:36:08] <EndgameContent> An Iddhi battery who is also a very good boy
[0:36:12] <hoenhime344> like the single player?
[0:36:31] <MagumaDono> The other option is to just not do the Level 3 mix as well
[0:36:44] <EndgameContent> I kinda wish Latigo's up attack didn't use Ammo unless you mashed it so he could actually play the video game in the meantime
[0:36:45] <MagumaDono> Like the Level 2 + Level 3 is neat, but you get so much more fun with just level 2
[0:36:45] <Zebroneath> @hoenhime344 Whole game is free on PS+.
[0:36:46] <%sileo_patronus> Yeah you don't de facto need the lv 3
[0:36:48] <Tampaoster> what game are you talking about?
[0:36:53] <MagumaDono> Indivisible
[0:36:54] <@SoushinSen> yeah?

[0:39:42] <Tampaoster> Reggie tensai
[0:39:47] <%Aussie_Manny> Elder Kai Unlock Potential.
[0:39:49] <%derrickslays> reggie is the man
[0:39:49] <EndgameContent> @Taco_Salsaguy You gotta pay attention to how much Iddhi attacks build and how much they slow down AP recovery.
[0:39:52] <fist_wizard_jay> I thought it was a Lil Mac hoodie from the thumbnail
[0:39:55] <%sileo_patronus> Reggie built to become a hitman
[0:39:56] <MagumaDono> Yo man. Shot Puts HURT
[0:39:57] <AMaidIndeed> Savage
[0:40:03] <EndgameContent> @Taco_Salsaguy It's not necessarily all about damage

[0:47:44] <EndgameContent> Yo Woolie don't forget you can air dash now
[0:47:59] <MagumaDono> @keyworthe This game is great
[0:48:02] <EndgameContent> There are little checkpoints that stop you from losing ringsels, it's not tied to literal save spots
[0:48:02] <+theAncopro> I like it
[0:48:18] <keyworthe> cool
[0:48:25] <MagumaDono> Shouldn't need the flowers, just some good control
[0:49:42] <MagumaDono> FFFF
[0:49:45] <MagumaDono> YALL
[0:49:49] <Kristoffers> lmao
[0:49:51] <+theAncopro> lol
[0:49:53] <Taco_Salsaguy> awww!!!
[0:49:53] <Kristoffers> dammit mike z
[0:49:54] <+Taglog7> Nice Majin Buu outfit
[0:49:54] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:50:27] <MagumaDono> Ohhhhh y'all still workin' on 3 bars too. I see I see
[0:50:38] <%Order_of_Mystery> look at that C O M B O
[0:51:10] <MagumaDono> Aight. I see what y'all workin' with
[0:51:27] <MagumaDono> I know this set up.
[0:52:54] <%sileo_patronus> Level 2 bullets break guard right?
[0:53:01] <MagumaDono> Level 2 bullets do not
[0:53:17] <%sileo_patronus> Huh, wonder what I'm thinking of then
[0:53:24] <SleepyMaribo> might as well not use Latigo if you have ot wait that long to use him
[0:53:44] <MagumaDono> It's a mixed bag
[0:53:47] <+theAncopro> THAT wass the boy
[0:53:53] <EndgameContent> DOG SPOTTED
[0:53:54] <MagumaDono> Depending on how you use him. Cause he can still attack without bullets
[0:54:06] <MagumaDono> and you can do combos, build meter, load him up mid combo, then dumb bullets
[0:54:07] <%sileo_patronus> If by 'exactly like' you mean 'literally the same'
[0:54:07] <EndgameContent> Yo you can grass the flying guy to get over to that platform
[0:54:13] <EndgameContent> I think there's a ringel there
[0:54:13] <Taco_Salsaguy> Doggo!!
[0:54:37] <MagumaDono> Everyone love Lanshi

[0:55:34] <%Order_of_Mystery> PUT THAT PUPPER IN YOUR PARTY POR FAVOR
[0:55:48] <MagumaDono> That middle one is MOST important
[0:56:10] <EndgameContent> He's your battery!
[0:56:11] <xiccy> Charge iddhi
[0:56:25] <+ilpeggiore_> He's a BARKACHU
[0:56:35] <fist_wizard_jay> PET THE DOG
[0:56:41] <fist_wizard_jay> DO IT NOW
[0:56:57] <MagumaDono> Time to see if he figures out Dog~
[0:56:59] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:57:14] <EndgameContent> He will NOT stop barking
[0:57:15] <spardanwarrior> Check that bork hitbox, it's insane
[0:57:48] <MagumaDono> HE GET IT
[0:57:50] <fist_wizard_jay> borf
[0:57:53] <MagumaDono> Lanshi has Great combo potential
[0:57:53] <EndgameContent> Woolie Has Discovered
[0:57:59] <EndgameContent> Use his 3-bar
[0:58:01] <MagumaDono> He's just reliant on that Level 1
[0:58:09] <MagumaDono> @EndgameContent :3c Level 3 is very good
[0:58:15] <MagumaDono> Many good boi
[0:58:19] <xiccy> he needs meter but he's STRONG AF
[0:58:20] <EndgameContent> It's one of my favorites
[0:58:28] <EndgameContent> Mash it
[0:58:37] <+theAncopro> oh maybe he good for latigo
[0:58:38] <EndgameContent> Mash triangle to pet more optimally
[0:58:49] <MagumaDono> @theAncopro He's pretty helpful for that~
[0:58:53] <EndgameContent> He's very good for Iddhi-dependent characters
[0:58:57] <v960> i dont understand how this game plays
[0:59:03] <fist_wizard_jay> Pet to BUILD METE
[0:59:09] <fist_wizard_jay> Meter*
[0:59:19] <DedlokPM> Is that a Kirby Kigurumi? wooliePOYO
[0:59:24] <MagumaDono> @v960 Each character is assigned to a button and you press up, down, or level the joystick at neutral to do different attacks with each character
[0:59:41] <v960> oooh
[0:59:51] <%jinking79> goddamnit Persona 5 why r u coming out in March of all months
[0:59:54] <EndgameContent> @v960 It's separated into "soft turns" where attacking starts your turn and waiting for a moment ends it
[1:00:02] <v960> but is it like, turn based? kind of like Project X zone?
[1:00:07] <bevyrage> @DedlokPM yes. be sure to thank punchmom for it!
[1:00:10] <MagumaDono> It's got a free turn mechanic
[1:00:11] <EndgameContent> MAXIMUM DOG
[1:00:16] <SleepyMaribo> Hype Dog Squad
[1:00:21] <MagumaDono> so long as you have an action gauge full (The button icons) that character can attack at ANY time
[1:00:23] <v960> i see
[1:00:25] <fist_wizard_jay> MAXIMUM DOG
[1:00:32] <JoeBecomesJoe> it marks him for the bolt
[1:00:36] <EndgameContent> You can't attack while enemies are attacking though
[1:00:38] <MagumaDono> So it allows for unique combos
[1:00:42] <EndgameContent> Inputs turn into a block command during enemy turns
[1:00:43] <%sileo_patronus> In the English language, the word 'charge' has multiple meaning
[1:00:44] <xiccy> Level one marks them so that you can hit them with lightning when he barks
[1:00:44] <spardanwarrior> You can only call lightning if you hit an enemy with the Level 1.
[1:00:58] <MagumaDono> Level 1 ONLY marks
[1:01:05] <JoeBecomesJoe> Yeah
[1:01:08] <spardanwarrior> Ding ding
[1:01:14] <EndgameContent> You have to ionize them first
[1:01:23] <MagumaDono> yeee
[1:01:23] <DedlokPM> @bevyrage as in she altered the size like the Unit 01 kigu or she made it herself?
[1:01:33] <EndgameContent> IIRC Lanshi's bark breaks or bypasses guard
[1:01:42] <MagumaDono> You can also wake lanshi up out of sleep with supers
[1:02:01] <EndgameContent> Level 1 marks them for up attack
[1:02:04] <EndgameContent> Otherwise it doesn't work
[1:02:28] <%sileo_patronus> Neutral looks like a great auto-extender
[1:02:37] <MagumaDono> Oh you gotta use LANSHI'S supers
[1:02:40] <spardanwarrior> Neutral bark hits full screen.
[1:03:15] <%sileo_patronus> Normal sleep
[1:03:17] <MagumaDono> Oh his default sleep not his super sleep
[1:03:29] <MagumaDono> He can be woken up from default sleep into stuff
[1:04:05] <MagumaDono> Lanshi's best color is 2

[1:07:18] <@Solidus_113> did Woolie forget about his airdash again?

[1:09:20] <MagumaDono> This is just an alternate way up the mountain

[1:13:18] <EndgameContent> I am watching this LP specifically to see Woolie's reaction to this
[1:13:21] <MagumaDono> hahaha
[1:13:24] <MagumaDono> same
[1:13:27] <thunderhog> Indivisibles mappings a bit weird in that it doesnt exactly mark off walls until you pysically see it, and pretends they're open ended until seen
[1:13:41] <MagumaDono> Yeah you gotta 100% explore it all
[1:13:46] <thunderhog> Also woolie condones dogfighting
[1:13:52] <thunderhog> Outside of Ace Combat
[1:14:05] <WanderingSwordsman> Not CBT
[1:14:17] <mayorrev> bork bork bork
[1:14:36] <thunderhog> Just a note but Doggo auto wastes al his actions if you ever decide to bark
[1:14:38] <@Solidus_113> tank pup
[1:14:43] <MagumaDono> Nope, he'll still be sleeping
[1:14:45] <v960> dog is not even amused by the little attacks
[1:14:57] <MagumaDono> But I do believe he takes less damage when he's asleep?
[1:15:34] <+tankusmaximus7> Probably has some dmg res while being a sleeping pupper
[1:16:21] <chonkyblade> is this game good?
[1:16:27] <a_mad_dragon> woolie killed and skinned kirby? BibleThump
[1:16:27] <MagumaDono> It's great~
[1:16:50] <MagumaDono> Lol she made you catch those dreads TWICE

[1:20:23] <+tankusmaximus7> I swear I heard Guile’s theme for a second there octoLewd
[1:21:28] <MagumaDono> @WoolieVersus So fun fact about this enemy: This is a backer Enemy that was inspired by the ram that the first Shofar was made from
[1:22:04] <MagumaDono> It's the jewish horn
[1:22:12] <MagumaDono> that is used during religious ceremonies
[1:22:15] <%sileo_patronus> dog level 1 seems better for bosses since it's a persistent effect
[1:22:33] <thunderhog> I cant belive he just 1 and doned you
[1:22:37] <SleepyMaribo> HONK
[1:22:40] <+XxBTExX> That's what you get for being a lil bitch

[1:25:20] <yoru899> borh
[1:25:24] <DedlokPM> mogsLOUD BARK
[1:25:28] <koolaid_kevster> brk!
[1:25:38] <kingkeldeo31> @SomersaultJustice Yes and no
[1:25:38] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1201765677977231360?s=19
[1:26:09] <MagumaDono> .... Bring Ginseng
[1:26:12] <@Solidus_113> don't need healing if you perfect block
[1:26:12] <yoru899> lei is super good for combos
[1:26:17] <+theAncopro> yooou may want a ginseng
[1:26:25] <thunderhog> Honestly Only debatable position is doggo
[1:26:29] <SleepyMaribo> not even gonna front... a healer is needed
[1:26:33] <thunderhog> Thorani's a great healer too doh
[1:26:42] <kingkeldeo31> @Solidus_113 So...we should bring a healer
[1:26:42] <yoru899> you gonna need a healer
[1:26:46] <%SilvaChariot0133> Leilani PogChamp
[1:26:47] <thunderhog> Im suprised people sleep on thoroni
[1:26:47] <MagumaDono> She is, but her healing is kind of tricky,
[1:26:48] <@SoushinSen> i actually beat the game without a healer.
[1:26:54] <@Solidus_113> apatJpeg
[1:27:02] <yoru899> dump tungar
[1:27:04] <stanlychicken> Dhar would be nice
[1:27:06] <MagumaDono> Nice~
[1:27:12] <MagumaDono> Did you beat the hidden boss @SoushinSen ?
[1:27:30] <MassConnect> I have faith in wooliee not needing heals
[1:27:46] <@SoushinSen> no i didn't i failed the platforming challenge to get there. i gave up because it's not required for platinum trophy
[1:27:59] <@Solidus_113> I spent like 2 hours on that boss
[1:28:04] <@Solidus_113> gave up
[1:28:08] <%SilvaChariot0133> LUL
[1:28:09] <stanlychicken> Don't need heals if you just parry everything
[1:28:12] <%SilvaChariot0133> ^
[1:28:17] <SleepyMaribo> this is honesntly the weakest part of the game, Mt. Sumeru has no reason to be so god damn long, considering how mant times you are forced to climb this place...
[1:28:28] <MagumaDono> That platform challenge is NOT easy lol.
[1:28:33] <%jinking79> @soushinsen i don't blame i felt the same getting to it
[1:28:34] <thunderhog> Yeah just third strike the world
[1:28:41] <%SilvaChariot0133> It's just that VERY last bit that's a pain in the ass
[1:28:42] <DedlokPM> Looks like we need Time Stop.
[1:28:43] <MagumaDono> But that cat is a FUN fight. I need to fight it now that the patches are in
[1:28:46] <+tankusmaximus7> You’re gonna platform, and you’re gonna like it vtsFINE
[1:28:54] <MagumaDono> lmao
[1:29:38] <thunderhog> The ringl's a bit tricky
[1:29:56] <%jinking79> the feeling of getting to the cat is painful beating it feels a lil bit good watch Mike Z disappear was something
[1:30:14] <koolaid_kevster> DAAAAAAAAAAAshhhhh lol
[1:30:16] <thunderhog> ...oh wait I did that ringel entirely wrong
[1:30:25] <MagumaDono> He did it~
[1:30:35] <MagumaDono> Any way you get the ringsel is the right way~
[1:30:53] <thunderhog> I speared the cealing under it and did a turn around axe to get it
[1:31:34] <+theAncopro> pogo
[1:31:37] <SleepyMaribo> just poggo
[1:31:47] <SleepyMaribo> how do you keep forgetting you have that ability?
[1:31:50] <thunderhog> The shit you learn from playing the beta of this game
[1:31:52] <@SoushinSen> a lot of ringsels have multiple ways to get them. so as long as you get it, i'd say it's a valid way.
[1:31:58] <+theAncopro> lol that was almost clutch tho
[1:32:20] <@Solidus_113> brute force wins again
[1:32:21] <MagumaDono> Lmao this is such a weird way to do this but I love it
[1:32:29] <MagumaDono> it's not how ya got there. It's Ya got there
[1:32:35] <DedlokPM> You could have just pogoed the bottom. rooBlank

[1:33:08] <MagumaDono> Hahaha that combo is so fun
[1:33:18] <thunderhog> Wollie was about to jump into leaf arrow there
[1:33:32] <MagumaDono> sometimes the jump is far more simple than one may think UvU
[1:33:55] <thunderhog> That was some sonic 1 spike clipping
[1:34:19] <stanlychicken> It's almost always just a corner
[1:34:33] <%SilvaChariot0133> just a corner with a ringsel Kappa

[1:34:50] <MassConnect> wouldn't you hear the ringsel though?
[1:35:28] <MagumaDono> You need an ability for it lol
[1:35:35] <207sun> this platforming reminds me a lot of hollow knight in a great way
[1:35:52] <%SilvaChariot0133> well that's one way to do that
[1:35:53] <%jinking79> ppl dis

[1:40:29] <MassConnect> how close is he to the next ringsel upgrade?
[1:40:34] <thunderhog> LUL
[1:40:45] <+KawaiiJetty> This game needs some ladders
[1:40:56] <%jinking79> Another episode of Woolie will figure it out complete
[1:40:58] <+tankusmaximus7> Hardcore parkour
[1:41:08] <kingkeldeo31> i think it's 15 ringsels for armor?
[1:41:20] <$GabeSweetMan> NotLikeThis
[1:41:21] <+tankusmaximus7> Also no need for ladders as you start getting a lot of mobility later
[1:41:25] <%SilvaChariot0133> I never even noticed that over there....
[1:41:32] <yiubhjfjy> BroBalt nice cock
[1:41:39] <%SilvaChariot0133> lytNOTIKETHIS
[1:42:12] <@Solidus_113> and also not hit the spikes at all, because it'll reset the ringsel
[1:42:22] <%SilvaChariot0133> I made this WAY more complicated than it needed to be LUL
[1:42:28] <$GabeSweetMan> As long as you land back on solid ground
[1:42:55] <+tankusmaximus7> Isn’t the air dash 8-directions?

[1:45:50] <@Solidus_113> Baz is real game content
[1:46:08] <+tankusmaximus7> As it should be
[1:46:35] <$GabeSweetMan> I'm still catching up on the VoDs, did Woolie fight Baz?
[1:46:39] <$GabeSweetMan> I assume he had to
[1:46:40] <@Solidus_113> no
[1:46:44] <$GabeSweetMan> Really?
[1:46:46] <@Solidus_113> we have to do this first
[1:46:49] <$GabeSweetMan> Huh

[1:48:29] <prime_name> I mean, they wouldn't be tired if they got proper sleep.
[1:48:32] <%DashXero> You'd probably be tired for the first two-to-five lifetimes. 5-10, you're probably rolling with it just to get yourself out of bed in the morning.
[1:48:42] <MagumaDono> He's just latching to the wall
[1:48:43] <lordsdb> Art and music has always change thur the ages. So I say that always worth seeing
[1:48:52] <MagumaDono> You can use the barnacle grip to cling to walls too, so weird lol
[1:48:57] <$GabeSweetMan> Time Stop

[1:55:23] <@Solidus_113> Leilani is killing your meter with the charge attacks
[1:55:37] <$GabeSweetMan> Leilani is great but yeah she was EXTRA useless here
[1:55:39] <MagumaDono> Take out Leilani
[1:55:41] <kingkeldeo31> use projectiles
[1:55:43] <fist_wizard_jay> Ginseng just needs Jar to heal
[1:55:45] <%SilvaChariot0133> Can still use her, but can't use charges
[1:55:47] <MagumaDono> cause you keep spamming Leilani
[1:55:50] <$GabeSweetMan> Leilani needs GROUND
[1:55:51] <lordsdb> Tungar is still good
[1:55:52] <%SilvaChariot0133> so Down-att only on lei
[1:56:00] <MagumaDono> You need to make iddhi anyway
[1:56:02] <MagumaDono> Just do it
[1:56:04] <MagumaDono> Bring dog
[1:56:12] <$GabeSweetMan> The whole fight is Iddhi based.
[1:56:19] <+theAncopro> dog also can attack anywhere
[1:56:33] <fist_wizard_jay> if he doesnt fall off the block
[1:56:45] <$GabeSweetMan> Gotta love the "battlefield" on this fight tho
[1:56:50] <fist_wizard_jay> right?
[1:56:54] <$GabeSweetMan> Or lack thereof
[1:57:05] <$GabeSweetMan> OhMyDog
[1:57:25] <stanlychicken> It's her dress
[1:57:27] <$GabeSweetMan> Blocking most important builder of Iddhi
[1:57:32] <MagumaDono> He's gonna figure it out~
[1:57:35] <MagumaDono> here we go
[1:57:35] <$GabeSweetMan> yeyeyeye
[1:57:37] <prime_name> Parry the God Ray
[1:57:46] <EndgameContent> You're still building bar for AJNA
[1:57:47] <+theAncopro> GOOD JOB
[1:57:53] <+theAncopro> you built the bar alright
[1:58:02] <fist_wizard_jay> WHOOPS
[1:58:02] <+LTKonnor> Razmi's like "Yeah guys we're fucked tbh"
[1:58:12] <$GabeSweetMan> PREPARE FOR BLOCKS
[1:58:16] <thunderhog> Save the world. Pet a dog
[1:58:17] <AMaidIndeed> pupper putting in work
[1:58:39] <stanlychicken> Took 10 health bars
[1:58:39] <fist_wizard_jay> Its not much, but its honest work
[1:58:41] <$GabeSweetMan> OhMyDog
[1:58:51] <prime_name> Bork at god!
[1:58:57] <$GabeSweetMan> Explode that milk!
[1:59:00] <drefizz> still falling
[1:59:06] <+theAncopro> YOU WISH
[1:59:11] <$GabeSweetMan> You don't need bar to BLOCK woolie! NotLikeThis
[1:59:26] <kingkeldeo31> Group block
[1:59:26] <oAznoUta> I officially love this dog
[1:59:39] <@Solidus_113> dhar is down
[1:59:45] <$GabeSweetMan> L1 WOOLIE
[1:59:48] <EndgameContent> Dhar is down, you say?
[1:59:58] <$GabeSweetMan> TEAM BLOCK
[2:00:01] <MagumaDono> Put Tungar back lol
[2:00:14] <fist_wizard_jay> I believe Woolie forgot how to group block
[2:00:18] <MagumaDono> Yeah that beam comes out stupid fast
[2:00:26] <%SilvaChariot0133> Just use Foresight Kappa
[2:00:26] <+theAncopro> it is pretty quick
[2:00:27] <fist_wizard_jay> Ahh nevermind
[2:00:27] <thunderhog> Might have to put doggo away as well Not sure how much beam you can build off of just petting
[2:00:28] <bevyrage> he didn't have the meter to block
[2:00:31] <$GabeSweetMan> Oh whoops
[2:00:34] <kingkeldeo31> Oh no
[2:00:37] <bevyrage> group block eats meter or it does nothing
[2:00:43] <$GabeSweetMan> Not a fan of some of the autosaves when reloading
[2:00:46] <MagumaDono> Now we thinkin'
[2:00:56] <+tankusmaximus7> Kala is a “How Daigo are you with your parries?” test
[2:00:57] <MagumaDono> Alternatively, bring Kushi Altun
[2:01:08] <+theAncopro> you basically gotta anticipate it after your turns done
[2:01:21] <%SilvaChariot0133> parry gives it back tho O_o
[2:01:26] <%SilvaChariot0133> or does he not have the upgrade yet?
[2:01:27] <$GabeSweetMan> You build up way more meter than you could ever spend if you block for extended periods.
[2:01:27] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:01:30] <MagumaDono> but that's gotta be successful
[2:01:31] <bevyrage> can't do it if you can't use it
[2:01:32] <%jinking79> it as bad as the cat
[2:01:46] <$GabeSweetMan> Ah he finally figured it out
[2:01:52] <$GabeSweetMan> Wait no
[2:01:57] <MagumaDono> He's figurin' it out~
[2:02:07] <MagumaDono> @jinking79 That cat is evil
[2:02:07] <$GabeSweetMan> Which thing is saying is a hold?
[2:02:08] <thunderhog> Also woolie you can hold Square to skip i eblive
[2:02:08] <Daigrey> Woolie will figure it out.
[2:02:12] <MagumaDono> it still has the Anti Razmi tech
[2:02:13] <+lazylazejv5> is this the end?
[2:02:13] <ht109> that's a nice pair of donuts
[2:02:31] <MagumaDono> Nah it's not
[2:02:36] <$GabeSweetMan> "I don't have bar" what on earth are you talking about woolie?! You never needed bar to block!
[2:02:37] <MagumaDono> just rebuild your team each time
[2:02:37] <+lazylazejv5> oh ok
[2:02:38] <kingkeldeo31> You don't need bar to group block right?
[2:02:45] <+theAncopro> lol
[2:02:46] <MagumaDono> You need bar to group block
[2:02:46] <thunderhog> MIKE
[2:02:59] <fist_wizard_jay> MIKE
[2:03:09] <$GabeSweetMan> Needing bar to block = apatWrong
[2:03:11] <bevyrage> does nothing if you don't have meter, so in essence: you need meter to group block
[2:03:15] <AMaidIndeed> Submit that class B bug report Woolie!
[2:03:17] <lordsdb> Can't you just manually block for all teammates?
[2:03:19] <EndgameContent> Blocking doesn't NEED meter, it just SPENDS meter
[2:03:20] <@Solidus_113> mash the face buttons
[2:03:25] <lordsdb> Or is that a no go
[2:03:29] <EndgameContent> You can team block meterless
[2:03:34] <EndgameContent> Target whatever head is closest
[2:03:35] <stanlychicken> No
[2:03:45] <$GabeSweetMan> You spend meter by team blocking but team blocking ON HITS builds it.
[2:03:57] <Psyramics> i dunno, tungar seems really bad at meter gen
[2:04:00] <fist_wizard_jay> no, just gotta gain meter a head at a time
[2:04:05] <$GabeSweetMan> Running out doesn't remove your ability to use it.
[2:04:47] <@Solidus_113> YEEEEEE
[2:04:52] <+theAncopro> niceu
[2:04:56] <$GabeSweetMan> Oh no he's mashing tho
[2:04:56] <MagumaDono> Nicely done~
[2:05:05] <$GabeSweetMan> Which increases his likely hood of fucking it up considerably
[2:05:09] <kingkeldeo31> Subarashi
[2:05:14] <$GabeSweetMan> Let's hope he can pull it off.
[2:05:15] <+RocketBarrel> Is that a Kirby onesie?
[2:05:17] <+VanaSkiller> Man Woolie has some strong patience
[2:05:18] <MagumaDono> Nah if he mashes it at that point he'll be okay
[2:05:23] <MagumaDono> the beam is so fast he'll catch most of em
[2:05:29] <+VanaSkiller> that or hes just brushing off chat
[2:05:31] <+TxukasaVersus> i need that kirby onesie
[2:05:35] <fist_wizard_jay> Actually I find mashing works wonders when it came to Kala’s beams
[2:05:40] <$GabeSweetMan> So just how many of woolie's fetishes ARE we looking at right now?
[2:05:49] <NarcissistCactus> all of them
[2:05:54] <+theAncopro> i think more so Reggie's
[2:05:54] <bevyrage> missing phoebe and legs
[2:05:58] <fist_wizard_jay> the only one missing is dreadlocks
[2:06:04] <MassConnect> no chemicals
[2:06:38] <$GabeSweetMan> yeyeye
[2:06:41] <bevyrage> huh, barely any beams this time around
[2:06:43] <%SilvaChariot0133> EZ Clap

[2:17:50] <auhsojnala> Just popping in. Is this the game that Pat and Woolie were arguing about in a podcast some weeks back, on whether or not it's an RPG? might be thinking of something else.
[2:17:51] <fist_wizard_jay> I guess they had a week to mourn
[2:18:00] <@Solidus_113> there's not much right now. Just check your ability list
[2:18:01] <fist_wizard_jay> and yes

[2:18:42] <+theAncopro> and the lvl 5 took me a bit to get
[2:18:49] <$GabeSweetMan> Dhar is the only death that mattered
[2:18:52] <thunderhog> I STILL dont understand the level 5
[2:18:54] <+iM_Pnut> Dhar killed himself so Ajna could be less of a shit kid
[2:18:56] <$GabeSweetMan> So says the script
[2:18:57] <thunderhog> but we'll get to that
[2:19:01] <Zebroneath> I dunno, they brush this off really quick

[2:29:04] <MagumaDono> Don't forget you can still use latigo moves before you build his level 2
[2:29:09] <fist_wizard_jay> Phoebe was way too damn fun to combo characters into her grabs
[2:29:11] <MagumaDono> Level 2 is a free reload~
[2:29:13] <stanlychicken> Aren't those more like afterimages?

[2:35:05] <MagumaDono> MELTS
[2:35:06] <thunderhog> JESUS THAT DAMAGE
[2:35:08] <MagumaDono> That's what's up
[2:35:10] <EndgameContent> Like butter!
[2:35:11] <@Solidus_113> I really hope Lab Zero adds all the character mechanics as visuals in an update later
[2:35:11] <MagumaDono> Y'all welcome to LAtigo Club
[2:35:32] <MagumaDono> @Solidus_113 You mean like a proper move list?
[2:35:32] <fist_wizard_jay> GUNSLINGER
[2:35:53] <$GabeSweetMan> "Why would you want a moveset?" -Mike Z probably
[2:35:56] <fist_wizard_jay> ded
[2:36:17] <$GabeSweetMan> *movelist rather
[2:36:29] <DedlokPM> "Why would you want a move list?" Mike Z definitely
[2:36:32] <@Solidus_113> Not movelist exactly, just a visual for latigo's bullets/Bhaozai's coins, etc on screen at all times, or at least at the start of fights
[2:36:39] <%SilvaChariot0133> Just figure it out yourself 4Head
[2:36:40] <MagumaDono> Ahhhh
[2:36:48] <$GabeSweetMan> Oh yeah that stuff where you don't even have a counter
[2:36:48] <MagumaDono> Yeah it'd be nice to keep track of Baozhai coins
[2:36:53] <MagumaDono> But Latigo does have his barrel at least
[2:36:57] <$GabeSweetMan> "How many do I have? IDUNNOLOL"
[2:37:05] <+VanaSkiller> jdotkdLewd
[2:37:07] <@Solidus_113> Dhar's rocks
[2:37:15] <%SilvaChariot0133> "Did he fire 6 bullets or only 5?"

[2:37:46] <mayorrev> giant woman
[2:37:54] <+G0DKnight> Damn, Amazon
[2:38:00] <MagumaDono> Yan needs her supers lol
[2:38:04] <EndgameContent> Woolie you gotta learn to juggle
[2:38:06] <+theAncopro> lol true
[2:38:07] <MagumaDono> But her Down attack ground bounce is nice
[2:38:08] <@Solidus_113> There have been a couple situations where you forget Latigo has his lvl 2 loaded already, and waste 2 bars of meter reloading agaion
[2:38:10] <EndgameContent> And end with her down attack
[2:38:13] <fist_wizard_jay> I cant wait til they add Phoebe’s supers
[2:38:51] <+PleasantLeech> I just got an ad for pringles that said it gives you bolder gameplay
[2:39:05] <fist_wizard_jay> lol
[2:39:28] <%SilvaChariot0133> LUL

[2:40:36] <$GabeSweetMan> Not in-air
[2:40:36] <Cubansupreme> leilani and her spin attack are great. it even groups enemies together.
[2:40:37] <@Solidus_113> never in the air
[2:40:52] <+leerocku> Ah...
[2:41:03] <$GabeSweetMan> My final team was Tungar, Kampan, and Leilani.
[2:41:05] <+theAncopro> yea spin combined razmi lvl 3 is like wOOsh

[2:41:58] <%SilvaChariot0133> like they just show up and do fuckall
[2:42:01] <$GabeSweetMan> Hell no we didn't. I still have no idea what they are.
[2:42:06] <fist_wizard_jay> other than block the road? no
[2:42:08] <$GabeSweetMan> Let alone what they do.
[2:42:21] <@Solidus_113> I like to imagine they're like the giant souls in DS2
[2:42:27] <DedlokPM> BACK BREAKER DA!
[2:42:29] <@Solidus_113> killing them makes the final boss easier
[2:42:32] <@Solidus_113> idk
[2:42:36] <%SilvaChariot0133> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[2:42:37] <+PleasantLeech> they're just damn jaywalkers blocking the road
[2:42:54] <$GabeSweetMan> lol leilani I forgot that line "haha the horrific pain tickles!"
[2:42:59] <fist_wizard_jay> Woolie that was the combo I went with for a loooong time
[2:43:07] <MagumaDono> Yeah no level 4 super
[2:43:09] <fist_wizard_jay> Zebei juggles into bacl breaker

[2:45:20] <+gryffon95> nah he should totally do it. he'll be fine
[2:45:55] <$GabeSweetMan> I never tested it, but I hope Leilani get's extra damage on the plant based enemies.

[3:02:31] <AMaidIndeed> They knew!
[3:02:32] <bevyrage> woolie's smile and optimism: ERECT
[3:02:40] <%SilvaChariot0133> Wait till you see 4
[3:02:40] <fist_wizard_jay> The Woolie Boner is strong
[3:02:40] <+stantashev> this is not naruto wtf
[3:02:44] <+theAncopro> so he's in a permanent slot lol
[3:02:45] <MagumaDono> 4 is REALLY good woolie
[3:02:55] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus Color 2 is Midorya's hero suit from Hero Academia BTW
[3:03:18] <NoirePanzer> Color 4!
[3:03:32] <%SilvaChariot0133> These shortcuts get weird AF
[3:03:37] <MagumaDono> Look at the map sometime Woolie,
[3:03:38] <+theAncopro> normally you unlock fast travel, but in this game you unlock NOT fast travel
[3:03:45] <MagumaDono> Like the big boat map shows you what's next to what
[3:03:47] <ManlyMcBeefington> Orange breakable now
[3:03:50] <KaiGoesMoo> @Solidus_113 Oh man I never realized that
[3:04:26] <%SilvaChariot0133> Physical heals it
[3:04:34] <thunderhog> You gotta bait him
[3:04:35] <MagumaDono> Ohhh this is the new update on the pelsite
[3:04:38] <MagumaDono> You gotta bait it
[3:04:38] <Psyramics> this bro wants nothing to do with you
[3:04:44] <$GabeSweetMan> LUL
[3:04:46] <thunderhog> LUL
[3:04:56] <WhizKid38> Wait this is done on stream??
[3:05:02] <MagumaDono> lmao I need to sit down and play these updates dang
[3:05:10] <Naho_Saenoki> I guess I need to look up Naga Rider's 4th floor on my own.
[3:05:14] <thunderhog> @WoolieVersus Yo you know what'd be real sick. Double rider kick with naga and ajna
[3:05:26] <MagumaDono> Actually he should be able to super mid air :0 unless that got patched out
[3:05:28] <%ChoculaUltra> haven't kept up with Indivis - did they actually add the movelist to the game yet
[3:05:38] <MagumaDono> Movelist doesn't exist in game yet
[3:05:42] <@Solidus_113> You can't see Naga's block animation because Phoebe is so big
[3:05:44] <MagumaDono> If you need one there's one on Imgur
[3:05:49] <%ChoculaUltra> lmao the fuck
[3:05:49] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:06:12] <UnfilteredComic> I think you can only do lvl 3 in the air with naga
[3:06:15] <MagumaDono> There ya go
[3:06:36] <MagumaDono> You can cancel into his Level 1 and 2 while airborne, he'll teleport
[3:07:25] <Fei_Dragoon> Sup everyone
[3:07:26] <@Solidus_113> cannon drill
[3:07:27] <%SilvaChariot0133> you do
[3:07:30] <MagumaDono> You have the answer
[3:07:32] <MagumaDono> you gotta double drill
[3:07:36] <+theAncopro> you carry momentum
[3:07:39] <MagumaDono> Dash into it
[3:07:55] <MagumaDono> Nicely done~
[3:08:13] <%SilvaChariot0133> and so are they monkaS
[3:08:40] <@Solidus_113> get those bars
[3:08:41] <thunderhog> Also if you ever build 5 bar, double rider kick with adja would be sick af
[3:08:45] <MagumaDono> I got that Movelist on deck my guy
[3:09:05] <Naho_Saenoki> OKAY. Just looked it up. Color 4 is the white Mighty Morphin' Power Ranger.
[3:09:10] <MagumaDono> You can do tighter move cancels with him as well, so you can divekick directly into summersault I believe
[3:09:10] <%ChoculaUltra> this just makes me want to play Xenogears again :(
[3:09:22] <+TheRealMasterof7s> Holy shit, this is what the lab is for.
[3:09:45] <DedlokPM> no
[3:09:49] <+gryffon95> from what ive seen no
[3:09:49] <thunderhog> Get into fighting games...via RPG?
[3:09:53] <mihokspawn> hi chat, hi Woolie
[3:10:00] <Cruel_Tentacles> It's a beat em up.
[3:10:03] <FeltSn0wman> i missed TFH ukogFeelsCrash
[3:10:06] <+leerocku> Hello
[3:10:24] <mihokspawn> Did they fix BigWaifu, or are her skills still glitched?
[3:10:30] <+leerocku> this is obviously a RPG and not a FG
[3:10:38] <fist_wizard_jay> Nah
[3:11:18] <@Solidus_113> Remember Skullgirls didn't have those tutorials on launch
[3:11:21] <mihokspawn> too bad, I was hoping to piledrive stuff
[3:12:18] <MagumaDono> DDR is the greatest for coordination
[3:12:27] <NarcissistCactus> project diva is basically a fighting game
[3:12:37] <MassConnect> does DDR have frame perfect stuff?
[3:12:38] <DaBigVitus> woolie just misunderstanding per usual
[3:12:43] <MagumaDono> @NarcissistCactus That's the best thing I've ever heard
[3:12:45] <MagumaDono> @MassConnect Yes
[3:12:47] <+TheRealMasterof7s> Hmmm....I dunno bout dat one chief
[3:12:50] <fist_wizard_jay> Yeh
[3:12:50] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:12:52] <MagumaDono> DDR has frame perfect inputs lol
[3:12:54] <%SilvaChariot0133> Get into Rhythm Games?
[3:13:02] <fist_wizard_jay> DDR does have frame inputs
[3:14:05] <spirittiart> can football help me in fighting games?
[3:14:12] <+TheRealMasterof7s> But will it teach it you the yomi?
[3:14:31] <%sileo_patronus> Can being a kicker help me in fortnite?
[3:14:42] <+hotrockcandy> I...was not expecting my name to come up, lol.
[3:14:42] <MassConnect> can pac man help with fighting games?
[3:14:53] <Cubansupreme> tales games? valkyrie profile?
[3:15:17] <+hotrockcandy> I honestly thought we was gonna battle, lol.
[3:15:39] <%SilvaChariot0133> sbfpBaz
[3:15:43] <+theAncopro> you got the big stuff
[3:15:45] <KingGoblodyte> 23 minutes useable
[3:15:51] <MagumaDono> 5 BARS
[3:15:51] <%sileo_patronus> Dhar's Dhead
[3:15:58] <+theAncopro> Dhar bad but Bar GOOD
[3:16:04] <+samsarasage> Oh man you get naga rider
[3:16:08] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus REMINDER that Halo: Reach is on PC now
[3:16:08] <$GabeSweetMan> "Sorry Razmi, I need more ARM POWER."
[3:16:10] <@Solidus_113> Dhar gave us 2 more bars of super
[3:16:12] <DedlokPM> 🦀 DHAR IS DEAD 🦀
[3:16:14] <MagumaDono> Thank you for this stream
[3:16:20] <MagumaDono> As I have new ideas to take to the Lab now
[3:16:21] <+TopTieramisu> when did kirby eat woolie?
[3:16:51] <MassConnect> did Kirby eat Woolie whole?
[3:16:59] <+TheRealMasterof7s> the cool shit comes later, Woolie
[3:17:02] <+QueequegTheater> Except most of them suck huge ass
[3:17:06] <MagumaDono> magumaRoar He dead now!
[3:17:08] <KingGoblodyte> DHAR DID NOTHING WRONG
[3:17:21] <+QueequegTheater> Everyone who isn't Razmi, Dhar, and Water MILF suck
[3:17:23] <@Solidus_113> He's a completed Yan, who still isn't a complete character
[3:17:31] <+TopTieramisu> kirby is puppeteering woolie like aldrich
[3:17:34] <%sileo_patronus> If dhar did nothing wrong then why is he dead?
[3:17:39] <mihokspawn> Naga is awesome, he pairs up nicelly with that other character that can be in this area
[3:17:50] <SomersaultJustice> foldies
[3:17:51] <a_mad_dragon> flippies
[3:17:54] <+theAncopro> fingees?
[3:17:54] <mihokspawn> CARD ADVANTAGE
[3:17:56] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Chicken, as you're both waiting to see who plays a card first
[3:18:06] <thunderhog> @WoolieVersus Usually we just call that the grind game
[3:18:14] <KamiiFlow> its called a bluff you swine
[3:18:15] <%sileo_patronus> Minies
[3:18:15] <+onepercentCHAN> Lookin good woolie
[3:18:27] <%ChoculaUltra> p sure its called card choking. I don't make the rules.
[3:18:37] <bevyrage> it'd be called 'handsies'
[3:18:43] <mihokspawn> @WoolieVersus there are cantrips, cheap cards that have draw an additional card
[3:18:44] <+TopTieramisu> hmmmm.....
[3:18:46] <MagumaDono> Interesting lore
[3:18:55] <+TopTieramisu> i thought toriyama made them blonde to save ink
[3:18:57] <SomersaultJustice> so Tien is the strongest fovever Kappa
[3:18:59] <+theAncopro> i thought it was save ink
[3:19:06] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus SSJ is tied up in a lot of Hindu color theory, actually. MasakoX has a great video on it
[3:19:09] <MagumaDono> Maha Heruka gets a few things, but she got some GOOD abilites you will learn in due time
[3:19:14] <MagumaDono> The Spiral energyu doesn't stop here
[3:19:27] <Psyramics> DragonBall SSJ transformations were inspired by Toriyama being a lazy shit and not wanting to color in black hair anymore
[3:19:32] <@Solidus_113> nah dude, it's 100% Gurren
[3:19:46] <thunderhog> No it's DEFF gurren
[3:20:08] <thunderhog> But i'd be down with some real ass rider colors. Sortta mad color 2 is technically Deku
[3:20:09] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1201765677977231360?s=19
[3:20:13] <DedlokPM> yeah the scarf being green and looking like energy is definitely gurren
[3:20:18] <@Solidus_113> and colour 2 is Midoriya's hero suit from Hero Aca
[3:20:22] <$KnivesEve> thats a spiral energy scarf
[3:20:25] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Now let's hope Indivisible's last ten minute don't suck as badly as TTGL's wedding.
[3:20:27] <@Solidus_113> not spoiling colour 4
[3:20:30] <%ozzrabbit> But Kabuto doesn’t have a scarf.
[3:20:46] <+theAncopro> gotta get those hearts up
[3:20:46] <MagumaDono> Get those side quests! They're fun!
[3:20:49] <+QueequegTheater> Like 7 years later and I'm still fucking salty
[3:20:56] <MagumaDono> ... Do Latigo's Side Quest
[3:21:04] <thunderhog> Yeah just saying side quests are good to go now
[3:21:07] <@Solidus_113> those quests will be showing up now that you're in the new world state
[3:21:21] <dmtjinni> Cute Wooly enters the arena
[3:21:26] <+QueequegTheater> Woolie's keyboards are using that spiral energy too
[3:21:51] <+TopTieramisu> how about Gon palette?
[3:22:17] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Halo Reach is on PC. Just saying
[3:22:26] <+theAncopro> les go
[3:22:30] <+QueequegTheater> do it coward
[3:22:36] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @TrebassStream
[3:22:53] <+TopTieramisu> that's some great politicianing
[3:23:00] <+TrebassStream> The music composer for death stranding roasted Woolie
[3:23:06] <+TrebassStream> don't forget
[3:23:39] <@Solidus_113> the prompts are on the screen for that
[3:23:43] <@Solidus_113> but the text is small
[3:23:57] <+QueequegTheater> In Woolie's defense, the UI is absolutely garbage
[3:24:02] <%ChoculaUltra> text really punishes people who play sitting far from their display.
[3:24:25] <+QueequegTheater> Sure Woolie Kappa
[3:25:05] <@Solidus_113> As usual, double blind LPs are a bad choice
[3:25:09] <@Solidus_113> It's been the case in the past
[3:25:10] <+TopTieramisu> aren't they patching the type?
[3:25:20] <@Solidus_113> about 2 weeks away
[3:25:57] <DedlokPM> Woolie Will Figure It Out
[3:26:17] <+QueequegTheater> I hope the next recording session starts with lliterally the entire zone destroyed with voidouts
[3:26:24] <%DashXero> But fuck those guys, though.
[3:26:44] <+leerocku> POYO
[3:26:47] <+QueequegTheater> @DashXero Maybe, but those people make him more money. It's a balance
[3:26:48] <WhizKid38> How is woolie with slow paced games. I have never seen him playing those
[3:27:03] <+QueequegTheater> @WhizKid38 It was called Snailborne for a reason
[3:27:08] <+QueequegTheater> He takes his time
[3:27:18] <+QueequegTheater> Which is fine, but can make an LP drag
[3:27:19] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:27:30] <+TrebassStream> Reggie's so cute "Bro, I'm here for you"
[3:27:38] <+QueequegTheater> Reggie is his nakama
[3:28:19] <@Solidus_113> you can get maybe 1 replay if you turn the spoiler filter off at the start
[3:28:19] <reiju_22> who replays death stranding? atpRtsd

[3:44:25] <%skyheys> GAME IS AMAZING
[3:44:25] <%WritebroAlpha> Glad to see that Renya's route broke Woolie's fear of Miura, only for that fear to come back TWICE AS STRONG
[3:44:27] <%0rond> NOT EVEN 50% YET
[3:44:27] <+Sp3ctre48> This was a very funny session LUL
[3:44:29] <+arancet> i can only promise this never stops
[3:44:29] <%213372bu> Just wanted to say "Kamasutra of FUCK" is strong
[3:44:30] <%Razputin217> YOU ARE FREE NOW
[3:44:30] <%Irridium> THIS IS MY FUCKING GOTY NOT EVEN CLOSE
[3:44:33] <%ChoculaUltra> just when you think you know, you fuckin' don't : the game
[3:44:33] <tattleworm> CEO of FUCK.
[3:44:33] <+Ryaotz> lovin it
[3:44:34] <irfan_> https://clips.twitch.tv/ExpensiveConfidentFungusMVGame
[3:44:35] <+MetroidPrimeRib> unbelievable I'm acting like an amateur
[3:44:38] <+Amaideus> The spoilercast for this game is going to be INCREDIBLE, so many bombs being dropped and we're not even halfway through yet. Following along has been amazing.
[3:44:39] <+coolthulhuu> no spoilers but it really nails the ending imo
[3:44:40] <%cobalt_phoenix_> FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[3:44:41] <%TubeMan642> wtf man
[3:44:42] <%Livelinne> FREEEEEEDOM
[3:44:51] <%gatorafan> BITCH YOU THOUGHT: The Game
[3:44:52] <Takfloyd> I'd say going heavy on Miura's route is by far the most batshit way to play the game, possibly should have been gated a bit more IMO
[3:44:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> also I LOVE THIS GAME IT FUCKS ME SO GOOD
[3:44:56] <alrobot2014> it feels like somebody lit some gasoline in my mind palace
[3:45:03] <%ChoculaUltra> the ending still makes my heart feel things when I think about it
[3:45:04] <%skyheys> THE WHITEBOARD IS LITERALLY A CUBE, THERES PICTURES
[3:45:06] <+Amaideus> By the way, I CAlLED THE CEO BEING RENYA
[3:45:09] <quietshun> Pat needs to keep playing the gane for a spoilercast to happen
[3:45:12] <Kenyuki4> Freedom!!!
[3:45:12] <+Amaideus> I called instantly
[3:45:14] <%Livelinne> Mind well blown. Again.
[3:45:15] <%DojoDGZ> YAY i can talk now
[3:45:17] <%Razputin217> If this game doesn’t win Best Narrative at the VGA’s I’m gonna shit
[3:45:24] <%ChoculaUltra> ah, totally thought Pat beat it off-stream or something by now
[3:45:26] <reonome> vote for 13 sentinels you fucks
[3:45:31] <T_Sasquatch> Post in chaaaattt
[3:45:31] <+cvp5127> @Razputin217 im just glad it got nominated
[3:45:32] <%213372bu> My gameplay was TOTALLY different from your route, my brain is breaking try even to rationalize how you're going through this... and I beat the game LUL
[3:45:33] <+Sp3ctre48> I do agree actually, the game should probably have been even more aggressive about locking you out of routes
[3:45:33] <%0rond> so you're morimura, and you're morimura, and YOU'RE MURIMURA, are there any other morimuras I should know about? AM I MORIMURA?!
[3:45:35] <%IzazaOzihaha> I busted out laughing at Renya Beardo reveal react
[3:45:38] <%TitaniumDragoonNeo> @Razputin217 Prep your bunghole then.
[3:45:42] <alrobot2014> @Razputin217 but tthat would require the critics to have played it and survived
[3:45:45] <reonome> OOPS ALL MORIMURAS
[3:45:46] <KngMatthias> Love this.
[3:45:48] <%Irridium> why the fuck is this game not in the "games with impact" category
[3:45:48] <chaos2frozen> I voted for 13 Sentinels for best Narrative
[3:45:49] <T_Sasquatch> Post link in chaaaattt
[3:45:51] <+ShoggothHat> @razputin217 I hope it does, but it's too niche for it I think.
[3:45:52] <quietshun> @choculaultra Bope, he still hasn't beaten it yet unfortunately
[3:45:56] <cerazor01> I like how at this point the Mecha are literally JUST a side distraction.
[3:45:59] <%ChoculaUltra> dammit Pat
[3:46:00] <+Amaideus> "WE'RE ALL BIG TITTY WAIFUS"!
[3:46:01] <quietshun> *nope lol
[3:46:04] <jorniev> non stop infinite morimura
[3:46:05] <chaos2frozen> Games for Impact is for indies isn't it
[3:46:09] <+BigCoffee> @chaos2frozen watch TLOU2 win anyway :(
[3:46:12] <%gatorafan> Sora has a bit of Morimura inside of him
[3:46:19] <jorniev> unlimited morimura works
[3:46:23] <reonome> Morixmura
[3:46:29] <chaos2frozen> @BigCoffee that's fine, it is a longshot
[3:46:32] <%skyheys> @chaos2frozen Theres a fucking Microsoft game in that category dude
[3:46:33] <Arweynn> is it just going to be all morimura's in terminator bodies?
[3:46:33] <+ShoggothHat> I was disappointed it wasn't even nominated for art direction for the vgas as well though
[3:46:39] <+Sp3ctre48> Sora is only half Morimura
[3:46:46] <+cvp5127> LUL
[3:46:52] <%skyheys> @sp3ctre48 that's nuts
[3:46:55] <%0rond> you're too late juro... i'm already a morimura

[3:47:07] <Takfloyd> if you start fuyusaka or juro's routes first, you'll know iori=morimura from the first hour... these guys went like 20 hours before realizing it
[3:47:07] <+Amaideus> "Juro, you fool. You're a morimura too!"

[3:48:12] <+Amaideus> I'm gonna corkboard the shit out of this this week
[3:48:16] <+Sp3ctre48> I tried to keep everyone's percentages around the same level for my playthrough
[3:48:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> I stand by saying that there is no wrong way to play this, every experience will be unique
[3:48:23] <%skyheys> Overriding clone babies is dark dude
[3:48:24] <%Irridium> oh I binged this shit hard
[3:48:26] <+cvp5127> I binged it
[3:48:28] <%WritebroAlpha> I binged this game in like 3 days
[3:48:29] <+Amaideus> Is it?
[3:48:32] <+arancet> every chapter i had to take a break to process
[3:48:34] <+Amaideus> They wouldn't have memories baseline
[3:48:35] <+cvp5127> i chugged it
[3:48:39] <%WritebroAlpha> Unputdownable
[3:48:39] <+Amaideus> Those get injected later
[3:48:44] <alrobot2014> i wouldn't be able to keep myself away from the info
[3:48:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> I finished between your first and second sessions LUL
[3:48:50] <%skyheys> I could only do 5 hours a day. took me a week.
[3:48:51] <T_Sasquatch> Link the mesoamerican Netflix thing please
[3:48:51] <chaos2frozen> @WoolieVersus I tried both method, I retained information better in short sessions
[3:48:52] <+Amaideus> It'd be like growing a body and leaving it a vegitible
[3:48:56] <+Sp3ctre48> I had to take a bunch of breaks so I could yell theories to myself
[3:48:57] <%TheLemuroid> I was screaming
[3:49:04] <+cvp5127> im still digesting tho
[3:49:08] <%WritebroAlpha> I literally watched Pat do Juro's prologue and then turned off his stream and bought the game
[3:49:13] <%WritebroAlpha> Finished it 3 days later
[3:49:17] <RetroCop87> I hit the game entirely in 3-4 hour chunks, and t was fine
[3:49:18] <%213372bu> 213372bu subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 4 month streak! My gameplay was TOTALLY different from your route, my brain is breaking try even to rationalize how you're going through this... and I beat the game LUL.... RE: binging it works really well when I rotated one ending per character
[3:49:31] <%Livelinne> took me a day to get through the trial version woolieDATTEBAYO
[3:49:31] <chaos2frozen> but only 2 sessions a week is tough man lol, you'll forget information
[3:49:32] <+MetroidPrimeRib> I played it in jp and am watching this to recontextualize and to hear dub
[3:49:34] <%TitaniumDragoonNeo> @chaos2frozen I regret binging the whole game over 4 days. But what a fucking 4 days it was.
[3:49:42] <%ChoculaUltra> this game would've been crazy on the vita had it come out during that era
[3:49:42] <+Amaideus> Only reason I haven't bought it is that it's stuck on Ps4 and I can't set mine up because reasons
[3:49:46] <%skyheys> @chaos2frozen This
[3:50:11] <+Amaideus> So I'm stuck with this playthrough unless I go watch someone else's, and they'd take it in a completely different direction
[3:50:12] <chaos2frozen> @chaos2frozen yup, I binge the second half of the game during my leave period and I slightly regreted it
[3:50:13] <%Irridium> main reason I binged it was to avoid spoilers
[3:50:13] <Mr_Strut> I was gonna say you wouldn't binge watch eva, but some probably do
[3:50:23] <%Livelinne> is it true that now it's on sale?
[3:50:27] <Takfloyd> I recommend watching other playthroughs to see how different they are
[3:50:29] <RyuuAoi> This that Persona type shit!
[3:50:35] <Takfloyd> nicoB has a good one on youtube
[3:50:37] <%skyheys> @amaideus Its on PS5 Kappa
[3:50:38] <dundunsun> Did they finish the game?
[3:50:39] <+BigCoffee> Hey guys, I was wondering if I could give a non spoiler input for combat. The skills that are say Error are simply passives, there have no animation and that's why it says error.
[3:50:42] <+Amaideus> Yeah but that's an "after i've finished" thing
[3:50:42] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:50:42] <chaos2frozen> @Livelinne yes, 30% if I didn't remember wrongly
[3:50:52] <+Amaideus> Trust me, I'm gonna watch other LPs once this is done
[3:51:01] <+Sp3ctre48> Play it the best way for you
[3:51:01] <Kghaleon> This LP made me buy the game. Already beat it.
[3:51:06] <rosemon5001> we need to see what punished woolie would say about this eye patch and all PowerUpL LUL
[3:51:11] <%213372bu> Oh no totally it's different for everyone and what makes this game GOAT material imo
[3:51:14] <%Livelinne> @chaos2frozen wow, thanks! I'm gonna get it woolieYE
[3:51:18] <%ChoculaUltra> I legit cannot wait for the next Vanillaware game
[3:51:22] <%ChoculaUltra> I'm foaming at the mouth.
[3:51:24] <RyuuAoi> Do OG Persona on the PSP next! Woolie WILL get bad end and have to play again! NotATK
[3:51:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> I have no self control FeelsBadMan
[3:51:33] <Kenyuki4> Took a week and a half. Boy you got to wait a second to think sometime
[3:51:45] <%skyheys> Tell the children the game's on sale, @woolieversus
[3:51:56] <%WritebroAlpha> I prefer not to binge, but when something like this catches my eye it's impossible to walk away
[3:51:58] <%WritebroAlpha> Holy shit
[3:52:05] <%ChoculaUltra> bro I'm about to make a new psn account just to buy it again to show support LUL
[3:52:07] <spinbel> Binge it though
[3:52:16] <%skyheys> Me. Kappa
[3:52:18] <T_Sasquatch> I do
[3:52:19] <+Amaideus> If I could buy this game
[3:52:19] <Mr_Strut> Binge One Piece
[3:52:20] <+Sp3ctre48> Kamitani said they'll probably never make anything like 13 Sentinels again unfortunately
[3:52:24] <alrobot2014> some of us don't have people to talk to
[3:52:29] <+Amaideus> Literally all my time not working would be spent blasting through this
[3:52:29] <spinbel> You're assuming I have friends, Woolie
[3:52:30] <RyuuAoi> Don't kill yourself over it. Do it on your time. We are here for you all the way, Woolie!
[3:52:31] <T_Sasquatch> Obviously i take a break
[3:52:34] <Takfloyd> I binged it, but with frequent walks outside to heavily think it over... figured out every plot twist in advance that way though
[3:52:39] <%213372bu> LUL
[3:52:40] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Sp3ctre48 I mean how could you
[3:52:41] <%Irridium> Yeah Kamitani said this was the hardest thing he's ever done and is not eager to do it again
[3:52:41] <+cvp5127> lol friends
[3:52:43] <%ChoculaUltra> FeelsBadMan
[3:52:52] <quietshun> Yeah this game is a once in a lifetime thing, it ain't ginna be replicated
[3:52:54] <+Amaideus> Yeah, I bet Kamitani won't
[3:52:59] <T_Sasquatch> You can't just click play on the next one LUL
[3:53:00] <reonome> friend...?
[3:53:02] <RyuuAoi> BINGE BIBLE BLACK
[3:53:03] <%skyheys> Why cant I talk to people and digest later
[3:53:09] <%WritebroAlpha> I'm enjoying Woolie's pace, tbh. I'm here for his and Reggie's amazing reactions.
[3:53:10] <+Amaideus> I tried to do something like this and ran into too much shit I just couldn't make work alongside each other and gave up
[3:53:13] <jorniev> DONT BINGE DEVILMNA
[3:53:20] <%ChoculaUltra> ngl, the only other game that does time travel that I dig as much as 13 Sentinels is probably Chrono Trigger. It's up there for me.
[3:53:21] <prime_name> Oh boy, can't wait to go and visit my friends to talk about recent media.
[3:53:28] <chaos2frozen> @Irridium yeah I can imagine, it would be awhile before we see anyone attempt a story like this ever again
[3:53:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> binge one piece Kappa
[3:53:38] <%skyheys> @prime_name Make sure to spread the covid
[3:53:48] <mortificent> Binging Black Mirror is like binging depression
[3:53:52] <T_Sasquatch> The relationship one with literally blocking people and recording memories still gets to me
[3:53:53] <%Irridium> also hard to talk about this game with others if you all go through different paths. hard to talk that way without spoiling various character paths
[3:53:53] <%WritebroAlpha> lel, I binged Chainsaw Man the other week. Went from 0 to caught up in 2 days
[3:54:02] <jorniev> DO NOT BINGE oyasumin pun pun DONT
[3:54:08] <%213372bu> Trying to talk about this game is like the anti-Black Mirror in that regard, that's why Pat didn't even want to discuss beginning stuff when you were going over it & I think he assumed you knew stuff you didn't
[3:54:13] <T_Sasquatch> Honestly Pop team epic is barely funny
[3:54:17] <%Livelinne> Pop team epic is a good yuri shiaVibin
[3:54:18] <%skyheys> @jorniev big depression
[3:54:19] <%TheLemuroid> Where's the 2nd half tho
[3:54:23] <rosemon5001> brain fired mayhaps? @WoolieVersus
[3:54:24] <+Amaideus> No Bloodrayne in the clip though
[3:54:26] <+Amaideus> Not even a mention
[3:54:28] <%WritebroAlpha> Pop Team Epic is hilarious
[3:54:35] <Arweynn> before you go, what caused the unmentioned 6 hour delay? if you're free to talk about it

[4:00:07] <%WritebroAlpha> This DMCA shit is awful; YT and Twitch can't be fucked to force the claimer to provide proof instead of the claimee
[4:00:10] <dellis80> oh goodie, youtube......RIP
[4:00:12] <%skyheys> Never trust digital media. put it on tapes like Gotou would
[4:00:14] <RyuuAoi> Woolie work too hard for us! bleedPurple
[4:00:16] <RyuuAoi> ThankEgg
[4:00:35] <%ChoculaUltra> not saying the music industry is dying - just more and more younger artists are now aware of the toxic pitfalls of signing to a label/not owning your masters etc.
[4:00:55] <%WritebroAlpha> tbf the music industry isn't dying, it's changing
[4:01:06] <%WritebroAlpha> And the law isn't keeping up, hence this DMCA loophole abuse
[4:01:06] <%ChoculaUltra> yes, changing is the better word
[4:01:10] <%jinking79> damn notifications i missed it
[4:01:12] <%PadreHail> PadreHail subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! Love you boyo, big HR hugs and kisses from Seattle
[4:01:21] <%ChoculaUltra> yes, thats exactly it @WritebroAlpha I'm so bad with words
[4:01:23] <RyuuAoi> Bet Pornhub don't got a DMCA. Just saying.
[4:01:29] <%cobalt_phoenix_> don't overwork youself man, the main thing is keeping your channel alive
[4:01:42] <%WritebroAlpha> The grifters who make shell companies and claim anything they can to make money off of people who can't be bothered to fight the claims are the worst though
[4:01:44] <%Livelinne> spaceyeenShock
[4:01:58] <%ChoculaUltra> we're still in some crazy times - I'd hate to see any of the VS boys overwork themselves!
[4:02:02] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @WritebroAlpha fuck those people
[4:02:06] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @RyuuAoi
[4:02:16] <%WritebroAlpha> The real problem right there; people exploiting the cracks in the system to make quick cash at the expense of creators
[4:02:16] <RyuuAoi> @moobot FUCK OFF
[4:02:21] <%WritebroAlpha> Absolute scum
[4:02:26] <%WritebroAlpha> gn woolz
[4:02:29] <+goofygoobergoo> Later Woolie, Reggie and chat!

[4:02:30] <xbb1024> bye
[4:02:31] <+CapnClassix> Nite Reggie, Woolie
[4:02:32] <%PadreHail> sbfpUno sbfpUno sbfpUno sbfpUno sbfpUno sbfpUno sbfpUno sbfpUno sbfpUno
[4:02:36] <+Amaideus> MINDBREAK
[4:02:38] <+CapnClassix> Goodnight chat!
[4:02:41] <+Amaideus> NEXT WEEK LET'S GO
[4:02:45] <%Razputin217> sbfpUno sbfpUno sbfpUno
[4:02:50] <%WritebroAlpha> ayy now, he's gone, THE TRUE CULPRIT of 13 Sentinels IS-
[4:02:54] <+Amaideus> I'm gonna miss calling them cowards for ducking out on Miura's story though
[4:03:19] <RyuuAoi> They are STILL cowards.
[4:03:19] <%ChoculaUltra> thank god this song isn't dmca-able
[4:03:41] <%PadreHail> Honestly Miura's got bangers but fucking Gouto's blew my asshole out
[4:03:43] <%WritebroAlpha> The only reason they stopped cowarding out is because Gouto's story scared them more
[4:03:54] <+Amaideus> He broke them so hard
[4:04:00] <+Amaideus> They were like "fuck it, can't get worse"
[4:04:00] <%ChoculaUltra> I thought Ogata's story had some heaters the first time through
[4:04:04] <%WritebroAlpha> The clips are glorious
[4:04:06] <dellis80> LUL
[4:04:09] <+Amaideus> IT's like when you start getting into the REAL questionable porn
[4:04:20] <%WritebroAlpha> I liked Ogata's story; he was the first one I finished
[4:04:22] <%WritebroAlpha> https://clips.twitch.tv/CredulousPrettyMoonPermaSmug#
[4:04:23] <+Amaideus> All of a sudden the kinky shit is just "eh, I've seen worse, let's give it a try"
[4:04:35] <+Amaideus> Bless you for clipping that too
[4:04:37] <%ChoculaUltra> that "I don't like this tag but fuck it, we're 10 pages in" type of porn
[4:05:00] <+Amaideus> You're just so mentally fatigued you get overconfident
[4:05:00] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1328635387057758213?s=19
[4:05:13] <+Amaideus> Or massively apethatic
[4:05:18] <+Amaideus> apathetic*
[4:05:32] <%WritebroAlpha> I love this part
[4:05:39] <%PadreHail> Beardless Reggie woolieSPICE
[4:05:45] <%Livelinne> joofbUWU
[4:05:57] <dellis80> LUL the disrespect
[4:06:08] <+Amaideus> Okay before I go
[4:06:08] <Takfloyd> I have a feeling there will be some more mind benders in the next stream that they're totally in the blind on, it will be fun to watch them squirm
[4:06:08] <%ChoculaUltra> oh no, they did get rid of the InvaderVie x CoD x 30 Seconds to Mars bit FeelsBadMan
[4:06:11] <+Amaideus> I have to say
[4:06:26] <+Amaideus> The way they used Gouto's story is fucking genius and it's the only way to make this story cohesive
[4:06:33] <+Amaideus> You can't get at him until roughly the midpoint
[4:06:41] <%WritebroAlpha> I love Gouto's story shutting you out completely
[4:06:43] <+Amaideus> It connects basically all the dots explicitly
[4:06:47] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> The best part
[4:06:49] <%PadreHail> Actually he's literally the final one I did
[4:06:51] <+Amaideus> And then it kicks you the fuck out until you reach the endgame
[4:06:54] <%Livelinne> joofbGasm joofbGasm joofbGasm
[4:06:55] <%WritebroAlpha> Like he's looking you in the eye and going "I'm the final boss, bitch"
[4:06:57] <%PadreHail> I think it actually forces you yeah
[4:06:59] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Amaideus
[4:07:11] <+Amaideus> No one say any spoilers, I'm following along Woolie
[4:07:21] <%WritebroAlpha> No spoilers
[4:07:25] <+Amaideus> Nice
[4:07:29] <%Livelinne> same here
[4:07:30] <%WritebroAlpha> Just an excellently written game
[4:07:32] <%PadreHail> I'll say one thing though
[4:07:32] <%WritebroAlpha> Easily my GOTY
[4:07:39] <%PadreHail> NOT DISAPPOINTED
[4:07:40] <+Amaideus> Story wise, no question
[4:07:46] <+Amaideus> I'm giving GOTY to Hades though
[4:07:47] <%WritebroAlpha> Ngl, I'm actually really looking forward to some of the battles, too
[4:07:58] <%WritebroAlpha> Especially the last battle of area 2, for REASONS
[4:08:04] <+CapnClassix> B U T
[4:08:06] <%WritebroAlpha> and of course the final battle, for CONCLUSIONS
[4:08:07] <+Amaideus> Hades and this are the two best games of this year, no question
[4:08:23] <%PadreHail> Did Woolie unlock the majesty of Missile Rain yet in the battles I haven't kept track on the battles as much
[4:08:23] <%WritebroAlpha> I'd put FF7R up there too, I loved it
[4:08:25] <+Amaideus> And if this sticks the landing it's going straight to my favorite story in media
[4:08:31] <%WritebroAlpha> But 13 Sentinels is my GOTY
[4:08:38] <+Amaideus> God, FF7r feels like so long ago
[4:08:44] <+Amaideus> So does Dokapon
[4:08:49] <Bedskirts> i have not played either. cannot remember what games I played this year. 2020 has been long and short at the same time.
[4:08:50] <%WritebroAlpha> DUDE LEMME TELL YOU it absoluely sticks the landing
[4:08:51] <+Amaideus> Man this has been a good year for entertainment
[4:09:04] <%PadreHail> Still got Cyberpunk in like
[4:09:07] <+worldwar14s> Just finished 13 sentinels today
[4:09:08] <%PadreHail> weeks
[4:09:10] <Takfloyd> you can unlock characters in a lot of different ways, by the way
[4:09:19] <Takfloyd> you CAN get gouto much earlier than this
[4:09:22] <+Amaideus> I'm not so hyped on Cyberpunk
[4:09:24] <%IzazaOzihaha> This, Like a Dragon, and TLoU2 are up there for me for sure
[4:09:25] <%WritebroAlpha> 13 Sentinels got my TGA vote for best narrative, but it got robbed by not being nominated for best art direction
[4:09:33] <+Amaideus> No reason
[4:09:42] <+Amaideus> Just thinking it's gonna be thoroughly okay
[4:09:51] <%WritebroAlpha> I wanna play Yakuza 7 but I'm only like halfway through 0
[4:09:51] <dellis80> @amaideus
[4:10:01] <dellis80> PogChamp a brethren
[4:10:06] <+crimsonconundrum> what the fuck is going on
[4:10:11] <+Amaideus> Stream's over
[4:10:11] <%PadreHail> Cyberpunk is gonna be like a hard 8.75 out of 10 I feel
[4:10:12] <%WritebroAlpha> As for Cyberpunk, my hype has waned; I'll grab it on sale like mid-next year
[4:10:17] <+Amaideus> Now it's out of context clips
[4:10:19] <%PadreHail> Maybe a personal 9
[4:10:28] <%Livelinne> aouuuuuu
[4:10:28] <+Amaideus> I'm thinking 8.5 at most
[4:10:33] <+Amaideus> Mostly for gameplay related reasons
[4:10:42] <+Amaideus> The story will probably be solid
[4:10:42] <%WritebroAlpha> The problem with Cyberpunk is that the hype is so big it will either be a slam dunk or an absolute failure
[4:10:45] <%WritebroAlpha> No inbetween
[4:10:59] <%WritebroAlpha> The talk of 6-7 hour prologues unironically has me excited, though
[4:10:59] <+Amaideus> Well, I'm out for the night
[4:11:01] <Bedskirts> cyberpunk will probably be flushed by a ton of big content folks, but be fun if you put in the time and just chill with it
[4:11:13] <+Amaideus> See'yall next Sentinels stream
[4:11:14] <dellis80> LUL oh god, it's an auto-tuned baby
[4:11:16] <%PadreHail> I think with the fact they've kept so much shit hidden as much as they've shown off is a testament to how ambitious it is
[4:11:24] <Takfloyd> woolie and myself unlocked shinonome through ogata's story, and ogata through kisaragi's... but on nicoB's LP i discovered you can unlock kisaragi and ogata through shinonome's story too, totally reversed
[4:11:28] <%IzazaOzihaha> Cyberpunk will be rad, but only as much as DMC5. That's my prediction.
[4:11:32] <%Livelinne> I have to get a slepp... g'night everyone woolieTRASH woolieGASM woolieTRASH
[4:11:39] <Bedskirts> @IzazaOzihaha I'm fine with that
[4:11:41] <%WritebroAlpha> gn all, I also to sleep must now depart
[4:11:47] <%PadreHail> I don't think any game can have a pop off like DMC5
[4:11:57] <%PadreHail> At least recentlt
[4:12:27] <%PadreHail> Like the expectation to final product ratio for DMC5 is nuts to look back on
[4:12:27] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:13:00] <%IzazaOzihaha> DMC5 was basically "Hey, you like the past DMCs?"
[4:13:32] <%PadreHail> They fucked nailed it so hard it gave me newfound optimism in action games since Bayo 3 is in cryosleep right now
[4:14:06] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Back to your home
[4:14:15] <Iniudan> Back to the trash!
[4:14:24] <%PadreHail> DESCEND INTO YO GWAVE

[0:20:07] <wannabemoogle> Thats real?
[0:20:08] <%Exiliator> Woolie wants a yes-man
[0:20:11] <%Sparkseid> Food Crimes all around
[0:20:11] <+Slimshazbot> I think that word itself is lethal to Italians.
[0:20:13] <%Prevot> is just two separate dishes put on the same plate, that shit doesn't deserve its own name
[0:20:13] <+xBolts4Lifex> No its not. If I want pizza i'll go for Pizza, if I want spaghetti i'll go get spaghetti

[0:20:14] <StarlitStunner> stripHmm
[0:20:16] <%Garthunox> Look Woolie, we get it, but we only ask why
[0:20:17] <dukenux> that sounds like something either delicious or extremely gross
[0:20:17] <fist_wizard_jay> chokejerked by pizzaghetti
[0:20:18] <%andrei11dr> Fuck that
[0:20:19] <SideChar> Food Crime
[0:20:20] <+Dr_DangerPhD> not gonna lie I could go for some pizza-ghetti
[0:20:22] <Zomner> I want to try it
[0:20:22] <Parapattern> That is Horrifying
[0:20:29] <%LordSDB> Milk bags should be a crime
[0:20:31] <pennykettle_> thats called supreme here ?
[0:20:33] <sniffy77> Oh hell no
[0:20:34] <%GraceTBM> yo! we have all dressed chips now!!
[0:20:37] <XCAltoona> we can get all dressed chips finally
[0:20:37] <extradopeness> Too many carbs bro
[0:20:37] <+chase959> olives
[0:20:38] <+Razputin217> I weep for you, Pizzaghetti cat
[0:20:38] <%Irridium> that sounds like something we'd do in the US but we don't because even that's too much
[0:20:41] <%andrei11dr> That like eating pasta with bread
[0:20:41] <killerjawa> Fun fact: spaghetti and pizza are not exclusive to Canada
[0:20:44] <+Superbro64> If pat really hated arms, that bit wouldnt last NEARLY as long. I would assume he would just not care.
[0:20:44] <%GraceTBM> all dressed chips are dope!
[0:20:45] <Su_Nes> this is giving me literal chills
[0:20:50] <Memdosu> yeah thats supreme in the states
[0:20:52] <extradopeness> Just stop
[0:20:56] <extradopeness> Stop it
[0:20:59] <+xBolts4Lifex> @LordSDB this
[0:20:59] <fist_wizard_jay> You put bacon on anything
[0:21:02] <XCAltoona> and I've had a spaghetti stromboli before
[0:21:05] <XCAltoona> it was not great
[0:21:05] <+x_geist> i spy gungrave
[0:21:08] <%andrei11dr> I don't believe you
[0:21:13] <T_Sasquatch> Wtf
[0:21:19] <pennykettle_> have you ever had pizza with mac and cheese on it
[0:21:19] <SomersaultJustice> I'd eat that
[0:21:25] <extradopeness> Those are functionally the same ingredients it’s just extra carbs piled on
[0:21:32] <extradopeness> Literally why
[0:21:33] <%Garthunox> it is remotely close
[0:21:34] <+Superbro64> Does spaghetti even HAVE a flavor being "carbs"?
[0:21:34] <lozard> Apparently I have been eating pizzagetti and didn't know it
[0:21:39] <%andrei11dr> Its la shit lazania
[0:21:40] <%Garthunox> it's very close woolie
[0:21:40] <T_Sasquatch> But FUCKING WHY
[0:21:42] <+chase959> if the world wasn't on fire I'd go to Quebec and try that out
[0:21:47] <dukenux> yeah pasta on dough sounds too much to me
[0:21:47] <DrFaustMD> it's disgustingly Canadian
[0:21:48] <+DreyfussFrost> It's like pizza and breadsticks but replace the breadsticks.
[0:21:50] <%Garthunox> it's on the same plate!
[0:21:51] <+Superbro64> Who eats spaghetti plain for the flavor?
[0:21:53] <+xBolts4Lifex> No they don't
[0:21:59] <FeelinNifty> sketti : )
[0:22:00] <MyNameIsRasus> I eat spaghetti with rice and beans, y'all are some weak
[0:22:04] <%optimasmaximas> per the subreddit, it is now april fool's in japan

[0:22:19] <+xBolts4Lifex> You want chicken and waffles because you're drunk and its 2 am
[0:22:20] <+DreyfussFrost> We LOVE pizza and breadsticks in America. Just substitute the breadsticks.
[0:22:20] <XCAltoona> pizza is already three ingredients
[0:22:23] <nobody12349> I DISLIKE ALL OF THOSE
[0:22:24] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1242929035937820672?s=20
[0:22:25] <T_Sasquatch> BACON AND ICE CREAM ??
[0:22:27] <IllusiveFish> What about Sausage and Pancakes?
[0:22:28] <T_Sasquatch> Wrf
[0:22:28] <fist_wizard_jay> sooooul food
[0:22:29] <dukenux> Chicken is protein, waffles are carbs
[0:22:31] <%eanscrale> Well chicken and waffles was literally cobbled from leftovers in the south
[0:22:31] <brambobelurkin> Chicken and waffles is fucking dank though
[0:22:38] <CureMode666> poutine is delicious
[0:22:40] <lozard> anyone who puts pineapples on there pizza has no room to complain about pizzagetti
[0:22:43] <%GraceTBM> sausage and pancakes is just breakfast
[0:22:43] <+YabbaTroll> yooo
[0:22:45] <+Superbro64> the person who first tried chicken and waffles was a HUNGRY mother fucker, thats for sure
[0:22:50] <+YabbaTroll> make that
[0:22:50] <+ItsRatman> Oh thats a good dish
[0:22:51] <%andrei11dr> Im a pepperoni pizza tipe of guy, I'll hold that shade
[0:22:52] <Su_Nes> yeeeeep
[0:22:57] <pennykettle_> spaghetti casserole: Spaghetti with ground beef and pepperoni and cheese is really good
[0:22:57] <%optimasmaximas> @Superbro64 or high
[0:22:58] <$SirGO0SE> hold up thats a meal now
[0:22:59] <+Superbro64> same as the guy who discovered milk
[0:22:59] <CaptainBright> ....that's just a gratinated pasta
[0:22:59] <brambobelurkin> @Superbro64 but we owe them so much
[0:23:01] <extradopeness> I don’t vibe with chicken and waffles
[0:23:02] <XCAltoona> a pizza casserole
[0:23:06] <rafaelba93> here in Brazil we are on a whole other level
[0:23:06] <IllusiveFish> me and my wife had it for dinner the other day so the breakfast arguement is null and void
[0:23:07] <SideChar> NOW thats food
[0:23:07] <CaptainBright> or lasagna
[0:23:15] <+DreyfussFrost> Honestly I'd rather have pizzagna.
[0:23:17] <XCAltoona> NOW! That's what I call food
[0:23:19] <+ghostsofcarcosa> That exist in some parts of Texas can't remember what its called or if its just a weird thing i knew people who did it
[0:23:22] <+GoodGamesPlayedBadly> GoodGamesPlayedBadly subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:23:24] <T_Sasquatch> This just sounds like wild hunger
[0:23:26] <natebud> That sounds like spaghetti
[0:23:29] <RC_S3kshun8> Yeah you could add some kind of binding noodle to make like PizzaZagna
[0:23:34] <extradopeness> I keep thinking you’re about to say PizzaGeddon
[0:23:36] <dukenux> id rather have pizzadilla
[0:23:45] <CrimsonSilver4> You can pretty much mix anything with pasta
[0:23:47] <+ghostsofcarcosa> they called it like a spaghetti pie or some shit
[0:23:51] <%andrei11dr> But beacon pizza is superior to pepperoni pizza thought
[0:23:51] <%mitchteck> I melt cheese on my spegetti all the time
[0:23:54] <+Superbro64> Like, someone was so hungry and frustrated, they threw a coconut against a rock, and found out that the insindes were edible
[0:23:55] <natebud> How about a calzone but it's full of spaghetti
[0:23:56] <+DreyfussFrost> God now pizzagna sounds amazing.
[0:23:56] <$SirGO0SE> i like pizzuffins pizzwiches and pizzandy
[0:24:07] <T_Sasquatch> Zaghetti
[0:24:19] <brambobelurkin> pizzazagna just layers upon layers of pizza and cheese and sauce. The Old Sauce. A dish so deep that man cannot fathom its elder status

[0:51:09] <+Superbro64> sbfpBleetz sbfpBleetz
[0:51:10] <worldbrand> yeah, for instance honeybees are not native to north america but plenty of wasps are important native pollinators and predators

[0:52:02] <razieltano123> @WoolieVersus Wasp are assholes. They KILL bees for no reason.
[0:52:04] <%andrei11dr> For some reason im not scared at all of bees and spiders, but roaches ,ants, and centipedes, FUCK THAT NOISE!

[1:00:14] <unit24> *wrisk
[1:00:24] <%andrei11dr> Im kinda sad i lost my FF6 mouse pad :(
[1:00:28] <@Solidus_113> Steam Controller isn't even being sold on the Steam store anymore
[1:00:37] <%Exiliator> Can you even get a steam controller now? I thought they stopped selling them?
[1:00:38] <+chase959> small swipes to change camera
[1:00:39] <MyNameIsRasus> Is it worse or better than the gamepad in the Dualshock 4?
[1:00:44] <+chase959> think track pad
[1:00:45] <unit24> my steam controller was given to me by my supervisor at work who didn't want it anymore
[1:00:45] <+gutlesscoward> I should've bought a steam controller
[1:00:45] <@Solidus_113> it was put out of commission a couple months ago
[1:00:47] <+YabbaTroll> its discontinued
[1:00:47] <ShawnEXE> so what you're saying is there's high resale value
[1:00:50] <+YabbaTroll> fps?

[1:01:06] <maplemilllk> You people don't use a madcatz controller? smh
[1:01:06] <@Squdnate> Oh thats not 60
[1:01:08] <Iwashi94> frames?
[1:01:08] <unit24> says something about steam controllers
[1:01:10] <@Squdnate> My eyes
[1:01:10] <+primax104> fps?
[1:01:11] <JetpackMcQuack> It looked cool for rts games
[1:01:14] <+EdenOfLove> that's like 20
[1:01:17] <pennykettle_> what is that? 10
[1:01:17] <+DreyfussFrost> Framerate is fucked up for some reason.
[1:01:17] <%optimasmaximas> WutFace
[1:01:17] <praisedasun_> the steam controller consumes frames to run
[1:01:19] <MyNameIsRasus> That's barely 20
[1:01:20] <@Solidus_113> yeah that's about 20fps
[1:01:20] <%andrei11dr> WutFace
[1:01:21] <Ipsenscastle> is the steam controller eating frames?
[1:01:24] <Zebroneath> Frames are tanking on stream for us
[1:01:24] <+Superbro64> doodFps
[1:01:25] <+EdenOfLove> WOOLIE framerate
[1:01:26] <unit24> also what the hell is up with the framerate dear god
[1:01:32] <razieltano123> @WoolieVersus The framrates is bonkers.
[1:01:32] <%GraceTBM> frames is fucko
[1:01:34] <Tucker0603> the controller is eating the frames!!
[1:01:35] <%Javaa01> Maybe time to turn off that Vsync
[1:01:36] <%Exiliator> MORE BEE SABOTAGE!
[1:01:37] <%Haarute> framerate looks awful to us

[1:01:39] <natebud> How does woolie even switch weapons without the keyboard?
[1:01:40] <%GeneralSCPatton> WHERE'D THE FRAMES GO?
[1:01:42] <+Kindan55> its more cinematic guys
[1:01:43] <@Solidus_113> It can't be the stream, because the stats are showing 60
[1:01:45] <ZComiX> is there no weapon wheel?
[1:01:47] <+jiggy_snipe> FRAMERATE
[1:01:49] <maplemilllk> how does a controller eat frames wtf
[1:01:52] <shinkerm> steam controller killin the frames
[1:01:53] <%andrei11dr> Woolie, this is running at 20 @woolieversus
[1:01:54] <+EdenOfLove> FRAMES
[1:01:56] <%GraceTBM> turn off fast weapon switch
[1:01:56] <Kraahka> Should we tell woolie to turn on the weapon wheel?
[1:02:01] <YakumoYomi> Steam Controller requires frames to function
[1:02:02] <ZComiX> YES
[1:02:04] <MyNameIsRasus> who thrashed my frames' grave
[1:02:07] <+DreyfussFrost> Rebind the left pad to the numbers?
[1:02:12] <%Exiliator> @WoolieVersus Bee stole your frames before it died
[1:02:16] <ZComiX> @WoolieVersus Weapon wheel is it an option?
[1:02:17] <+Razputin217> MY EYES
[1:02:18] <+TDotGoat> 15fps, not bad not terrible
[1:02:19] <+tuchpi> frames are FUCKED
[1:02:21] <SomersaultJustice> drop your frames woolie
[1:02:23] <%Javaa01> Turn Vsync off
[1:02:24] <MyNameIsRasus> oof
[1:02:32] <natebud> Is it the game?
[1:02:35] <%Binary_Fireball> is it the steam controlller?
[1:02:37] <+EdenOfLove> and the tearing
[1:02:39] <%Irridium> I *believe* you can customize the controller in such a way that you can bullshit in a weapon wheel.
[1:02:43] <%optimasmaximas> its the steam controller
[1:02:45] <%optimasmaximas> abort
[1:02:45] <niddron> stop downloading porns
[1:02:46] <+jiggy_snipe> turn it off I guess
[1:02:46] <SomersaultJustice> it's alllll the steam controller's fault!
[1:02:51] <%andrei11dr> quick reboot? @woolieversus
[1:02:52] <@Squdnate> Big Picture has an impact
[1:02:53] <pennykettle_> big picture might do that
[1:02:54] <+EdenOfLove> big pictture mode eats 20 frames
[1:02:56] <@Squdnate> That's probably why
[1:03:01] <maplemilllk> I thought big picture would do something like that
[1:03:04] <Tucker0603> I think big picture is fucking you
[1:03:04] <%Haarute> big pic is not great
[1:03:04] <+tuchpi> big picture WutFace
[1:03:07] <MyNameIsRasus> Big Picture is probably why
[1:03:09] <%cylish> big piture causes all kinds of frames issues
[1:03:16] <@Solidus_113> SourPls
[1:03:17] <%andrei11dr> Turn off big picture
[1:03:17] <Kraahka> @WoolieVersus Turn off fast weapon switch and you will get a weapon wheel, it might help you

[1:05:57] <+croxeye> is this the.... steam controller?

[1:09:00] <Dr_Mooose> kids gotta learn

[1:09:11] <maplemilllk> Trap your children so they become ninjas
[1:09:12] <%Binary_Fireball> as a kid I would lay out tacs on the floor and jump over them while playing indiana jones
[1:09:13] <%Exiliator> Reggie with the spartan way
[1:09:17] <GarbageNirvana> Speaking from experience there?
[1:09:18] <+justianxix> You mean jetpacks or die
[1:09:18] <%Prevot> evolve or die is Heihachi's way of parenting
[1:09:20] <dukenux> Good Ol' Spartan parenthood
[1:09:20] <+DreyfussFrost> It also reinforces that the stuff you stop him from doing is REAL danger if you don't stop the mini-dangers.
[1:09:22] <%Binary_Fireball> It's not fun without the danger

[1:16:31] <Visorak6> the other soldiers saw the steam controlled and cringed out of existence

[1:16:51] <+Lizard0TM> and that's okay
[1:16:51] <dukenux> I am still kinda intrigued about SC. wish i'd pick it when they sold it for like 5 bucks.
[1:16:51] <+YabbaTroll> some dude on the half life reddit beat this on mobile
[1:16:52] <+Superbro64> @dimfish So you use dvorak I see? Kappa

[1:17:55] <$SirGO0SE> good eye yabba
[1:18:10] <maplemilllk> Woolie use the Virtual Boy controller
[1:18:11] <natebud> This is the level where I finally found out the AI was reaaaaally bad
[1:18:13] <+jiggy_snipe> I don't have an opinion but Woolie just started using it so it'll take time to get used to it
[1:18:19] <%andrei11dr> Just get the fucking duke controller out
[1:18:22] <+Superbro64> Truly, these super soldiers were trained well to murder lab coated nerds
[1:18:25] <dukenux> Maybe try the Kinect you used to kill the bee with it
[1:18:30] <%Binary_Fireball> steamlink is dope though
[1:18:32] <pennykettle_> remember when it was supposed to have a screen on it? That initial design was so good

[1:18:40] <%Javaa01> The tech in them lives on with the Vive controllers though
[1:18:42] <$SirGO0SE> we playing on antiques baby

[1:19:26] <maplemilllk> Starcraft on a plane is like Snakes on a Train

[1:27:52] <maplemilllk> Woolie Tech Tips
[1:27:53] <+Superbro64> rip that one guy
[1:28:04] <+JMDurden> You have to turn the click off and turn the haptics on.
[1:28:17] <JetpackMcQuack> This is fun :)
[1:28:20] <+xx123manxx> @maplemilllk instead of dropping tech he drops combos
[1:28:26] <@Solidus_113> What's the record for most sync tests in one session?
[1:28:40] <natebud> Did you know that the Marines will not attack you if they are fighting other enemies? You can crowbar them all to death easily.
[1:28:46] <VJdarkworld> id say the learning curve for steam controller is a month. the default layouts are bad and ya basically need to change everything thro trial and error. its hella annoying to figure it all out
[1:28:53] <+JMDurden> If you go into the Steam Controller with the mindset of "this is just another gamepad" and not "this is new", you're gonna have a bad time.
[1:28:53] <+thehandicapiblegamer> Good afternoon

[1:29:27] <Melchior_the_Wise> Woolie is really playing this mouse and controller?
[1:29:32] <+xx123manxx> yeah
[1:29:34] <+JMDurden> If you love the idea of customization, there's literally no better controller than the Steam Controller. If you hate tweaking things to your personal preferences, then yeah, the SC isn't for you.
[1:29:44] <FennecZephyr> I wasn't able to use the steam controller much because it didn't work with Destiny, and I never tried it much beyond that

[1:35:51] <dukenux> Nerds with guns
[1:36:16] <ReyThePCPlayer> so what's Woolie's solution to the aiming problem
[1:36:23] <@Solidus_113> throw that jerry can
[1:36:30] <%jinking79> great now i have to listen to Gorillaz again
[1:36:59] <kaze7897> Just use a grenade
[1:37:06] <kaze7897> To clear out a bunch of mines
[1:37:11] <%Javaa01> You can, but you need to learn how to use console commands
[1:37:16] <%Javaa01> You don't even need a mod
[1:37:22] <natebud> You have to physically touch the mines for them to go off.
[1:37:28] <+xx123manxx> green crosshairs > all
[1:37:32] <@Solidus_113> ^
[1:37:39] <Tucker0603> you can but via console commands
[1:37:47] <FennecZephyr> Yeah, I always set my crosshairs to a bright green if I can help it
[1:37:49] <Twichty> no cahnces will be spares , all bombs fired apon
[1:37:51] <+Plaxer> you should be able to change it
[1:37:53] <natebud> As long as your crosshair has a dropshadow, it's no problem
[1:37:59] <%GeneralSCPatton> Someone figure out the command for him
[1:38:13] <%Javaa01> There's a reason Counter Strike 1.6 defaults to a neon green UI across the board
[1:38:18] <%andrei11dr> It's green in HL 2 i believe
[1:38:20] <%NWannabe> danger...high voltage

[2:17:34] <CrimsonSilver4> I don't mind the redesing of the first Zen level. The original was just 15 minutes of bad platforming and the new one adds a lot to it. The other levels could be shorter
[2:17:44] <dukenux> Survival Horror ass bathroom
[2:17:45] <Volk551> Awoo Woolie
[2:17:49] <CrimsonSilver4> Xen*
[2:17:53] <+xx123manxx> TBH I would rather play HL1 Xen 19 times over before playing Black Mesa Interloper one more time
[2:17:55] <+Kindan55> It's at least better, and the vort stuff and boss fight is great.
[2:17:57] <+xx123manxx> that chapters sucks shit
[2:17:59] <BurdRightsActivist> @natebud No, you're not very good
[2:18:12] <Artista_AF> tanks for streaming Brachy
[2:18:18] <Artista_AF> *thanks
[2:18:19] <BrachyZoid> lunarLove lunarLove lunarLove lunarLove
[2:18:40] <Artista_AF> lunarLove
[2:18:51] <natebud> Interloper was alright in the original. That's all I can say about it.
[2:19:23] <Volk551> Real fake doors
[2:19:33] <+gustavozxd> they found a way to make interloper worse? LUL
[2:19:39] <+xx123manxx> Black Mesa Interloper feels like the team played way too much Doom 2016 and just made a TERRIBLE HL mashup
[2:19:51] <%Javaa01> Interloper way better
[2:19:52] <pennykettle_> Nihilanth was dogshit. I got to him and then say I beat it. Theres also that bug that prevents progress after gonarch
[2:20:02] <%Irridium> look at this fuckin' Prey gun
[2:20:06] <natebud> @gustavozxd It's probably the best Xen chapter. Really padded out though
[2:20:34] <%aceleapc> @xx123manxx what does that even mean??
[2:20:54] <%EySoyCoco> woolieSHOOK
[2:20:57] <%Exiliator> Fudge again?
[2:21:03] <oyyzzo> crouch jump
[2:21:04] <CrimsonSilver4> A lot of Black Mesa Xen felt like DOOM 2016
[2:21:11] <natebud> I know what he was talking about. They reused the BFG room puzzle and made it 5 times as long @aceleapc
[2:21:32] <%Javaa01> What's up there is not worth all this trouble
[2:21:45] <am_omega> If I recall Black Mesa Xen just used the concept of what original Xen was going to be.
[2:21:45] <+Kindan55> that factory plug puzzle...
[2:21:53] <MassConnect> fire is temporary
[2:21:56] <+JingKaisean> wait don't you have a long jump?
[2:22:03] <%Exiliator> woolieYE : "Fucking bitch ass bitches!" woolieREGGIEFUL : "Fudgin darn biscuits!"
[2:22:04] <+xx123manxx> long jump isnt till end game
[2:22:05] <+cursedwithadhd> it's a single common item
[2:22:07] <simon__well> omg
[2:22:08] <natebud> desks, filing cabinets
[2:22:17] <natebud> Woolie at full ammo, looking for more ammo
[2:22:17] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:22:18] <%Javaa01> It's just suit energy and like a couple mags of ammo for guns that you're already full up on
[2:22:22] <+tuchpi> jermaVenus
[2:22:25] <brian_peppers1> sprint jump should work
[2:22:26] <%EySoyCoco> strafe-circle jump or some shit
[2:22:27] <astrofalcon1> half life 3 is up there Kappa
[2:22:40] <+Kindan55> the vaccine is up there
[2:22:49] <+gustavozxd> oh my god NotLikeThis
[2:22:53] <pennykettle_> twintelle is confirmed for smash up there
[2:22:55] <+tuchpi> please keep doing this :)
[2:22:56] <natebud> evergreen content?
[2:23:07] <+gustavozxd> vergil dlc is up there
[2:23:12] <%XeroSigmaPrime> THis is like Max attempts that sequence break in Ori lol
[2:23:12] <+gustavozxd> !motivated
[2:23:12] <@Moobot> 769 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[2:23:16] <+YabbaTroll> when is woolie going to stream cs surf maps?
[2:23:19] <%aceleapc> that puzzle is a little too long but saying they used the bfg room puzzel specifically is kinda lol considering how long xen was in development
[2:23:51] <%andrei11dr> Half Life 3 is like an Old God ,if you see it you lose your understanding of reality and you go nuts
[2:23:53] <+theKingRamses> does what make sense? an osprey?
[2:24:02] <TheyCallMeVawn> Probably shouldnt keep using the bee gun
[2:24:02] <dukenux> Let them fight
[2:24:09] <Melchior_the_Wise> Rapid fire doesn't home
[2:24:10] <@Solidus_113> alt fire has no tracking
[2:24:17] <%Haarute> rapid fire loses homing properties
[2:24:22] <+cursedwithadhd> looks like that gun has unlimited ammo for a reason
[2:24:28] <Ranger747> @YabbaTroll now we're talkin
[2:24:28] <natebud> @aceleapc its like really obvious. Xen was in development since around 2015
[2:24:28] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Ospreys dont exist, theyre made up by the government
[2:24:42] <extradopeness> Yeah this project predates even the wolfenstein games from Bethesda right
[2:24:43] <dukenux> can you blow up that tank
[2:24:45] <Melchior_the_Wise> All birds don't exist, they're a conspiracy
[2:25:03] <+YabbaTroll> r\birdsarentreal
[2:25:05] <agustorm123> That aim KEKW
[2:25:11] <fangovafang> right on da ass lol
[2:25:15] <+tuchpi> gotta recharge those birds
[2:25:15] <dukenux> Birds went extinct in early 00s, what you see are sophisticated drones
[2:25:16] <+xx123manxx> my bird needs new batteries
[2:25:27] <+Blackjackal95> doesn't the MP5 have extra grenades?
[2:25:32] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Corona is just an excuse to replace the batteries in all the birds without anyone noticing
[2:25:36] <@Solidus_113> meaty
[2:25:41] <%andrei11dr> Also don't forget that space is fake @melchior_the_wise
[2:25:46] <+Kindan55> he should've let them fight it out with the aliens
[2:25:48] <natebud> I'm really disappointed. I found out the Tau cannon charge doesn't do extra damage like in the original anymore.
[2:25:54] <%Javaa01> You're good
[2:26:04] <Visorak6> Osprey
[2:26:23] <pennykettle_> woolie's mouse aim is surprisingly good
[2:26:25] <%Javaa01> You can prevent all those guys from coming from the chopper if you shoot it down fast enough
[2:26:43] <Kraahka> @natebud What do you mean? If you charge it up in this game it does a lot more damage
[2:27:01] <Kraahka> You even get a little kickback like the original
[2:27:05] <@Solidus_113> Charged Tau gibs enemies
[2:27:17] <natebud> @Kraahka no it doesn't. I tested it. Always takes the same amount of ammo to kill an enemy.
[2:27:18] <+Kindan55> hivehand dual
[2:27:26] <+xx123manxx> it doesnt even need to start beeping to gib dudes
[2:27:34] <+JingKaisean> not gonna look at him?
[2:27:36] <+kewlmyc> Wait, is Woolie using the GAMER CUBE yet?
[2:27:37] <+gutlesscoward> parking lot
[2:27:45] <+cursedwithadhd> wouldn't you hear friendly chatter if there are friendly's the save
[2:27:58] <+gutlesscoward> gamer^3
[2:27:58] <natebud> @Kraahka You used to be able to kill a grunt with 8 ammo charged, 12 single shot.
[2:28:02] <AppleBerryKitty> anyone know if woolie is playin the uncut version with more maps or original?
[2:28:05] <Volk551> More real fake doors
[2:28:09] <+Kindan55> I definitely used charged tau to one shot some enemies on hard
[2:28:12] <+kewlmyc> Guess that answered my question
[2:28:13] <%Haarute> woolie has embraced the c u b e
[2:28:26] <%Exiliator> The cube is home
[2:28:26] <+Taglog7> oh, so it's the couch master
[2:28:29] <CrimsonSilver4> Woolie likes this new weapon because he doesn't need to aim anymore.
[2:28:35] <ReyThePCPlayer> Black Mesa marketing: we made Woolie's butt sore
[2:28:40] <%Javaa01> Load the launcher
[2:28:41] <%Exiliator> no its juts a bag
[2:28:42] <%Javaa01> By hand
[2:28:42] <natebud> @Kraahka Now it always takes 14 ammo, if you go for arm shots at least
[2:28:43] <Visorak6> MANUAL RELOAD
[2:28:43] <pizza_oven3000> is it safe ??
[2:28:49] <+gutlesscoward> that's what, 3 rockets to the face now
[2:28:58] <%lewdskeletor13> PogChamp500 if y’all are looking for another FPS series in the future, maybe try Wolfenstein? The Old Blood is a stand-alone prequel with only 8 missions, so it wouldn’t be too long. the main character is Doomguys great-grandpa, fun fact. Killing evil runs in the family.
[2:29:00] <+Kindan55> @appleberrykitty only on a rail is cut in this version really, and that mod isn't updated yet.
[2:29:01] <%Haarute> gordon taking direct hit missiles to HIS FACE like a champ
[2:29:05] <+xx123manxx> crouch under tank shots on canon
[2:29:12] <pennykettle_> thats dope
[2:29:20] <%Javaa01> There's a reason these things are manned by teams IRL
[2:29:20] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:29:25] <pennykettle_> Does hl2 ever do that?
[2:29:32] <dukenux> nope
[2:29:33] <%jellycouch> .... what is this jank and why do I love it
[2:29:35] <dukenux> i don't think so
[2:29:36] <AppleBerryKitty> ok, thanks
[2:29:36] <Melchior_the_Wise> Not that I know of
[2:29:39] <unit24> surface tension uncut content is next
[2:29:44] <unit24> the real tasty shit
[2:29:54] <+gutlesscoward> the uncut surface
[2:29:55] <%RioGascar> Half life 2 does not do that
[2:30:01] <%Javaa01> Go back down and drain that wall heal
[2:30:07] <am_omega> I should replay HL2.
[2:30:20] <natebud> It's worth it, just replayed it
[2:30:31] <am_omega> Actually let me reprise that, I should just play Ravenholm again.
[2:30:32] <%Javaa01> Explosive damage is the only type of damage that harms the tanks
[2:30:32] <+YabbaTroll> ... how many ichyasaur chomps
[2:30:34] <unit24> mister owl, how many crowbar hits does it take to get to the center of this tank?
[2:30:39] <dukenux> i think you can actually destroy a tank with crowbar
[2:30:39] <mistersups> The Right Crowbar in the Wrong Place.
[2:30:42] <+xx123manxx> im but to replay HL2 myself tbh
[2:30:50] <natebud> @am_omega correct
[2:30:56] <dukenux> but more that you'd hope
[2:30:58] <%lewdskeletor13> How powerful would Vergil be with the crowbar?
[2:31:00] <+YabbaTroll> i mean the tank cant shoot you if you are right next to
[2:31:01] <%Genericmistake> @am_omega it honestly does not hold up as well as HL1 So much of HL1 is just "look at this physics puzzle" every few minutes.
[2:31:04] <%Exiliator> LUL
[2:31:07] <+Kindan55> been replaying it with mmod, pretty great
[2:31:08] <%Binary_Fireball> wish you could duel wield crowbars
[2:31:13] <VJdarkworld> i should replay half life 2 episode 3 :)
[2:31:13] <%Genericmistake> HL2***
[2:31:17] <%Binary_Fireball> nothing makes you feel safer than holding 2 crowbars
[2:31:24] <am_omega> I know.
[2:31:24] <Th3rd3> @am_omega but you don't go to Revenholm anymore TehePelo
[2:31:31] <pennykettle_> yea but guess what? physics puzzles will never get old
[2:31:32] <%RioGascar> wait is this still surface tension
[2:31:35] <pennykettle_> just like ragdolls never get old
[2:31:37] <+xx123manxx> yep
[2:31:41] <%Javaa01> Yeah they're kinda having a war with the ayyliens
[2:31:49] <CrimsonSilver4> There's actually a 35 second video about destroying a tank with a crowbar in HL 1 on Youtube.
[2:31:56] <natebud> The vortigaunt aim is so bad that you can just strafe back and forth in that hallway endlessly
[2:31:56] <+gustavozxd> i played hl1 to ep2 for the first time this year and I preferred 2 by far
[2:31:57] <%RioGascar> I figured black mesa would rename these parts
[2:31:57] <unit24> man can you believe this is where the mod version of surface tension ended
[2:32:20] <dukenux> One More Time~
[2:32:24] <oyyzzo> last time until next time
[2:32:39] <AppleBerryKitty> this game is bigger than I remember
[2:32:47] <+gustavozxd> yeah it drags on
[2:32:51] <%Haarute> cube <3
[2:33:00] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Hl2 > Hl1 Fight me
[2:33:02] <natebud> Surface Tension is huge. This stream was just half of Surface Tension
[2:33:11] <@Solidus_113> you fool, don't do it
[2:33:11] <derap41> Cube is nice
[2:33:24] <dukenux> Embrace the cube
[2:33:26] <Professor_Rakor> The cube is your....Companion in these dark times.
[2:33:27] <%jepupu> GamerCube™
[2:33:27] <BlueMoonBlues> Embrace the cube
[2:33:29] <+jiggy_snipe> Pat was right. oh no
[2:33:29] <pennykettle_> oh is stream over or just break?
[2:33:30] <%Binary_Fireball> you say that now
[2:33:30] <StarlitStunner> Cube protects
[2:33:32] <%XeroSigmaPrime> GAMER CUBE
[2:33:32] <dukenux> You say that now Kappa
[2:33:36] <karl_rex> THE CUBE
[2:33:36] <+Kindan55> ! uptime
[2:33:36] <+kewlmyc> LOVE THE CUB
[2:33:38] <Professor_Rakor> Like some sort of Companion Cube.
[2:33:38] <moonologist> can you map a contoller button to quicksave?
[2:33:39] <+DreyfussFrost> @woolieversus Do you have a virgin 5 button mouse or a chad 15 button mouse? 15 buttons would negate the advantage of keyboard over hybrid.
[2:33:42] <zamzoph> Does Woolie have a GAMER CUBE? PogChamp
[2:33:46] <+Kindan55> !uptime
[2:33:46] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 33 minutes

[2:33:54] <DedlokPM> E M B R A C E T H E C U B E psaWhat
[2:33:57] <am_omega> Soon all will be with the cube
[2:33:59] <brian_peppers1> surface tension seems long because woolie is playing and it's his first time
[2:34:02] <+cursedwithadhd> Woolie are you talking about a chair
[2:34:04] <%Exiliator> I disagree that hl1 held up better than 2
[2:34:05] <%Binary_Fireball> does pat cube with steamlink? or do he just run cables?
[2:34:13] <asurite_warrior> steam over?
[2:34:22] <ReyThePCPlayer> wait, is the stream ending?
[2:34:26] <+Dimfish> so is he done with stream now or is this just a break?
[2:34:29] <DedlokPM> @asurite_warrior no. config fiddling
[2:34:36] <+Dimfish> ah
[2:34:37] <@chesterr01> @retrocop87 tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:34:39] <ReyThePCPlayer> oh thanx
[2:34:43] <asurite_warrior> thx
[2:34:44] <RetroCop87> Where can I buy one of those FANTASTIC SHIRTS, Woolie?
[2:34:52] <Memdosu> here's whats gonna happen, real cube will come and then Woolie will actually prefer travel cube more
[2:34:59] <RetroCop87> @chesterr01 ty
[2:34:59] <+Kindan55> black mesa as a setting is just way more unique then the meh outside bits in 2
[2:35:02] <+DreyfussFrost> Yeah Steam has controller mapping built in now.
[2:35:06] <@chesterr01> SeemsGood
[2:35:07] <%Haarute> lots of dengue mains in my area
[2:35:14] <+DreyfussFrost> Not sure about hybrid setups though...

[2:36:18] <AppleBerryKitty> man i hate those mouses just give me a normal one.
[2:36:21] <fangovafang> dope
[2:36:22] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:36:28] <%jepupu> That's Naga isn't it?
[2:36:33] <zamzoph> wait, it's not numpad, shaped?
[2:36:35] <+DreyfussFrost> Ah, nice! So you do already have a multi-button mouse.
[2:36:37] <Twichty> gamer dial
[2:36:40] <+Hinasil> Mice are like cars, it doesn't matter what they're called as long as they go zoom zoom
[2:36:41] <%jepupu> MMO mice basically
[2:36:41] <Visorak6> Yeah the new nagas have three different button sideplates
[2:36:45] <moonologist> neat
[2:36:53] <+DreyfussFrost> We don't get to see it often so I didn't know what you had.
[2:36:53] <niddron> buy product
[2:36:54] <derap41> a full Num Pad
[2:36:55] <am_omega> MMO mice are just so weird to me.
[2:37:08] <zamzoph> too many buttons! NotLikeThis
[2:37:08] <agustorm123> The wut now? cmonBruh
[2:37:10] <+RedKnightVI> Speaking of Razer, you ever see the Nostromo keypad? For the two armrests, it might be ideal
[2:37:17] <%aceleapc> actually using mmo mice for an mmo is not comfortable imo
[2:37:18] <%jepupu> I have a Corsair Scimitar myself. It's nice for MMOs at least.
[2:37:18] <Memdosu> 15 button?! hell yeah
[2:37:20] <Visorak6> He doesnt like keypads
[2:37:28] <+DreyfussFrost> @woolieversus Ok, cool. Totally not an ad, I just wanted you to have a good time with the PC games!
[2:37:36] <%Binary_Fireball> multi mouse buttons imo are a waste, keyboard is better

[2:46:41] <+Monkeydude07> Did Black mesa start
[2:46:42] <%NWannabe> just hold the L, kid
[2:46:48] <slyarvicle08> Something interesting about space operas is when you create your universe you can add certain elements of different themes to fit the plot and can expand in the same universe itself
[2:46:52] <%Binary_Fireball> Donald Duck invented hentai
[2:46:58] <Melchior_the_Wise> Speaking of, have you seen the star wars animation made into anime openings?
[2:46:59] <%Binary_Fireball> it's a scary world

[2:47:48] <Sol_Install> now I just learn about Akira Kurosawa. The more you know
[2:47:49] <%Binary_Fireball> and I'm only half joking
[2:47:49] <%andrei11dr> Well Star Wars always felt more like a western, New Hope specifically
[2:47:57] <Twichty> player 2 is JKLI
[2:48:00] <am_omega> Oh I bet.
[2:48:03] <SomersaultJustice> million arthur's keyboard controls are atrocious

[2:49:23] <%andrei11dr> Zero for now
[2:49:25] <ReyThePCPlayer> how many american soldiers have you killed today?
[2:49:30] <CrimsonSilver4> Given that woolie literally got a bee gun, too many to count
[2:49:30] <+YabbaTroll> woolies is using the bee hand weapon so about 500
[2:49:34] <am_omega> You want to talk about fucking set ups. how about back in the day trying to figure out what the fuck those Japanese only PC fighting games were saying when your computer could not properly show the characters in the menus.
[2:49:41] <unit24> oh my god I didn't even realize that the wasp from earlier was just foreshadowing for the hivehand being found this stream

[2:50:50] <+jiggy_snipe> we always do it live
[2:51:01] <slyarvicle08> @andrei11dr Let's say that Star Wars lends itself to various elements such as the western, part of the era of the samurai, politics and corruption, dictatorships in worlds and of course the path that the hero takes towards these situations
[2:51:03] <am_omega> yeah those god damn rectangles.
[2:51:10] <Twichty> i need a new kingdom death expansion...
[2:51:31] <ReyThePCPlayer> The hivemind is basically the console gun with its auto aim bullets
[2:51:45] <%Binary_Fireball> Kingdom Death has some of the best minis around
[2:51:49] <Melchior_the_Wise> I though Star Citizen was the fastest kickstarter
[2:51:50] <%Binary_Fireball> the monster designs are superb
[2:51:58] <+kewlmyc> That one porn game kickstarter though
[2:51:59] <+theKingRamses> gloomhaven is rad
[2:52:08] <Melchior_the_Wise> well, maybe the highest grossing.
[2:52:09] <%Javaa01> Board Games are usually also finished concepts that just need money to go into print
[2:52:18] <%The_Timo> We have all the KDM expansions coming still haha, Gigalion and the strain system is kinda neat, makes it rougelike lol
[2:52:25] <%RioGascar> which now they arent able to print now
[2:52:30] <+xx123manxx> all this work you could prolly just set up an autoexec cfg file
[2:52:32] <Ranger747> Did that Dark Sould board game do anything
[2:52:37] <%Binary_Fireball> @WoolieVersus if you need recommendations for people to paint you KD minis I know some good folk
[2:52:37] <+xx123manxx> takes 30 seconds
[2:52:43] <%RioGascar> That devil may cry 5 kickstarter board game is getting delayed
[2:52:54] <$SilverRoddo> Sounds like Woolz’ is hinting at Woolie VS: the board game?
[2:53:01] <Visorak6> Good dice are fuckin expensive
[2:53:02] <%andrei11dr> @slyarvicle08 I mean yeah, part of the mentality behind the creation of Star Wars was melting together a bunch of ideas from the past for the first time
[2:53:11] <+aishman> @SilverRoddo He already does, it's called Tablelords
[2:53:23] <slyarvicle08> @andrei11dr Exactly
[2:53:23] <$SilverRoddo> bahaGasp
[2:53:34] <slyarvicle08> @andrei11dr I forgot something I was going to mention. The militarization of the sides that will fight for a common goal
[2:53:37] <%Binary_Fireball> If Woolie and Sirlin made a card/board game that would be dope.... is Sirlin still around?
[2:53:46] <Ranger747> Side thing; their's a fun manga about girls playing tabletop games. They had some cool shit called Geister

[3:01:01] <Zayasu> secret discord tech PogChamp
[3:01:02] <slyarvicle08> We have technology
[3:01:09] <asurite_warrior> Just get a gamer pod
[3:01:09] <Camail> DONT SAY THAT
[3:01:10] <$SirGO0SE> No one man should have all this power!
[3:01:16] <slyarvicle08> jajajajajja
[3:01:21] <astrofalcon1> oh god
[3:01:22] <Kraahka> Gamer cockpit
[3:01:26] <%rytyoung> Tell Pat the case beats cube everytime
[3:01:28] <cero_5> the real cube were the friends you made along the way
[3:01:42] <%FuqBoiSlim> Yooo, indivisible just got an update for....couch co-OP?
[3:01:42] <dukenux> honestly gamer cube is a scam. it's just two arm rests and a plank
[3:01:43] <%Binary_Fireball> put an arms sticker on the case send it to pat
[3:01:53] <slyarvicle08> Sometimes technology betrays us ugly
[3:02:00] <$SirGO0SE> yesterdays podcast was top tier
[3:02:08] <%Binary_Fireball> hoes still mad
[3:02:10] <%Javaa01> It's the sprinkler system
[3:02:11] <%rytyoung> I could make a cube
[3:02:22] <natebud> there's upstairs or upstairs
[3:02:27] <@Solidus_113> APC
[3:02:28] <derap41> humvee
[3:02:30] <%Th3SmartAlec> That tank's heart is still beating
[3:02:31] <+MaddyCaddy> It's a Humvee
[3:02:35] <zamzoph> Woolie doesn't know what a tank is LUL
[3:02:36] <%Javaa01> It's just a Humvee
[3:02:43] <%Javaa01> APCs are bigger
[3:02:49] <%Javaa01> But not as big as Tanks
[3:02:52] <%rytyoung> Dieeee
[3:02:59] <Tucker0603> that ain't no APC
[3:03:00] <%jellycouch> I was counting
[3:03:03] <natebud> There will be an APC that you can crowbar in a bit
[3:03:22] <unit24> woolie's been spoiled by siege mode
[3:03:31] <pennykettle_> that gun is amazing vs vehicles
[3:03:36] <%ChoculaUltra> I love how it writhes :)
[3:03:37] <+MaddyCaddy> It was good for the final boss in the original too
[3:03:44] <jackoftheflames> ye, that laser gun is boring
[3:03:53] <%GeneralSCPatton> THAT IS A HEAVY WEAPON FOR BIG BOIS
[3:03:57] <%andrei11dr> The 64 gun ,this is not
[3:04:00] <%Th3SmartAlec> So there's this game called Doom Eternal
[3:04:03] <natebud> The tau cannons good in this game you treat it like an SMG
[3:04:04] <%NWannabe> rest in power gauss-chan
[3:04:05] <+Taglog7> SingsNote SingsNote
[3:04:05] <IgnusSTV> fake railgun
[3:04:15] <pennykettle_> Th3SmartAlec tell me more
[3:04:17] <%RioGascar> this is wild listening to different opinions on the guns in this game having no previous experience with them
[3:04:20] <agustorm123> Are we going to play portal too?
[3:04:24] <%Exiliator> RE-RE-REMIX
[3:04:30] <Daxalog> How does a twitch stream get domonitized?
[3:04:34] <%Th3SmartAlec> @pennykettle_ It's a video game with many big guns
[3:04:36] <zamzoph> rip vod PepeHands
[3:04:56] <natebud> You used to be able to destroy an APC with one fully charged shot in the original.
[3:04:56] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:05:12] <pennykettle_> Th3SmartAlec interesting but can I tear enemies?
[3:05:13] <derap41> Given the damage you've done I would too
[3:05:16] <+jiggy_snipe> greater threat
[3:05:20] <+Taglog7> Pepe wrist
[3:05:22] <Twichty> danm right , u saw what he can do with that crowbar , its unnatural to hit that fast
[3:05:24] <natebud> They actually attack every enemy before they attack gordon including headcrabs.
[3:05:28] <+aishman> Go back!
[3:05:34] <+aishman> You have to go down where you shot those soldiers
[3:05:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> @pennykettle_ You not only can tear enemies, but you can RIP and tear! Until it is done, even.
[3:06:01] <Twichty> oh yeah this
[3:06:09] <derap41> Yeah that shit is super funny
[3:06:43] <natebud> And the scientists still had normal dialogue as they're falling. Hello Gordon
[3:06:46] <derap41> Most of these meat gags worked better with the more basic graphics
[3:06:53] <pennykettle_> scientists going "Come with me, I am the only one that can fix this" and then getting head turned to red mist is pretty good too
[3:06:54] <%andrei11dr> Iea it does the Bloodborne thing LUL
[3:06:55] <MyNameIsRasus> Hit that padlock woolie
[3:06:56] <dukenux> yeah HL has some Ludicrous Gibs
[3:07:18] <natebud> Ragdoll is the evolution of the meatgag
[3:07:23] <%lewdskeletor13> Max goof? goofy fucks
[3:07:31] <BisoromiBear> red means go
[3:07:38] <ReyThePCPlayer> earth is getting terraformed
[3:07:47] <derap41> @natebud Early 2000s Ragdoll LUL
[3:07:54] <@Solidus_113> don't worry about it
[3:07:55] <%andrei11dr> Get hyped for Xen human
[3:07:56] <%Javaa01> The gauss cannon is different
[3:07:59] <Visorak6> What replaces the gauss cannon is equally amazing
[3:08:00] <Twichty> that shit was broken
[3:08:02] <dukenux> :(
[3:08:07] <derap41> rip gauss
[3:08:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> NEW THING IS AMAZING
[3:08:19] <MyNameIsRasus> It was actually TOO good
[3:08:20] <%Irridium> new thing isn't gauss, but it's still REAL good
[3:08:21] <%lewdskeletor13> There’s a replacement for it
[3:08:23] <gunsrlove> Ballista is not Gauss-chan and will never be
[3:08:23] <%Javaa01> They replaced it with good shit
[3:08:23] <razieltano123> @WoolieVersus That canon was beyond broken.
[3:08:23] <%FuqBoiSlim> the ballista is kinda based tbh
[3:08:29] <%andrei11dr> YOU GET A BETTER THING THAN THE GAUSS
[3:08:40] <unit24> it doesn't suck, it's just not disgustingly powerful
[3:08:44] <mMayrro> he thinks tau cannon sucks LUL
[3:08:44] <gunsrlove> It's not better, the fuck you talking about chat
[3:08:46] <%andrei11dr> But you need 6 keys to get it
[3:08:51] <%GeneralSCPatton> YOU'RE USING THIS GAUSS WRONG
[3:08:55] <IgnusSTV> hit the padlocks woolie.
[3:08:55] <%lewdskeletor13> They made suicide seem bad ass
[3:08:57] <Visorak6> The tau cannon is extremely strong though
[3:09:00] <$SirGO0SE> BUSTIN MAKES ME FEEL GOOD
[3:09:05] <%Haarute> woolie can't aim, so he can't gauss
[3:09:08] <NaturalGear> tbh the super shotgun is as busted
[3:09:12] <dukenux> tau cannon is just an alt rocket launcher
[3:09:13] <derap41> These things are so cute
[3:09:23] <+serranobros> holy shit the bitrate eats it there
[3:09:26] <$realm_forge> What they replaces it with to still pretty good fully upgraded
[3:09:46] <natebud> oops
[3:09:53] <This_is_Marco> committed
[3:09:55] <mMayrro> getting ready to fight those guys with a crowbar 4Head
[3:09:57] <%Javaa01> There's no jump to be made
[3:09:59] <+xx123manxx> F
[3:10:00] <dukenux> yes, make more noise
[3:10:08] <+xx123manxx> you can make that jump
[3:10:20] <Twichty> HEHHE
[3:10:23] <@Solidus_113> real boys
[3:10:23] <natebud> He'd have to stack boxes outside to get that stuff now
[3:10:23] <mMayrro> LUL
[3:10:25] <%Irridium> nice

[3:10:34] <%lewdskeletor13> That’s sick
[3:10:37] <+xx123manxx> LUL
[3:10:46] <%andrei11dr> Woolie did the cool
[3:10:46] <mMayrro> sick moves woolie
[3:10:47] <%Exiliator> Ah SHIT!
[3:10:50] <dukenux> was he crashed by the car lift
[3:10:54] <natebud> Woolie did more damage to himself than the soldiers LUL
[3:10:56] <Visorak6> "man I thought for sure that strat would get him sarge-did he just blow himself up?"
[3:10:59] <dukenux> *crushed
[3:11:05] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[3:11:18] <+Th3SmartAlec> UGH
[3:11:37] <fist_wizard_jay> Its morphine time!
[3:11:58] <natebud> Achievement is for killing 20 people with the hivehand
[3:11:58] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1242929035937820672?s=20
[3:11:59] <startstoprepeat> nope
[3:12:02] <Twichty> in the real version he used only a crowbar :)
[3:12:03] <$realm_forge> Woolie is wrist deep in that bug gun right now
[3:12:04] <+jiggy_snipe> naw he killed 100s
[3:12:07] <dukenux> Cannonicaly, Freeman got never bitten by a headcrab
[3:12:07] <%GeneralSCPatton> Ludonarrative dissonance?
[3:12:10] <%Exiliator> I think its more like youre sideways, rather than they being deep in right?
[3:12:10] <natebud> Woolie is most wrong
[3:12:15] <pennykettle_> doom guy killed millions
[3:12:20] <+MaddyCaddy> 25 dudes is still a Platoon of marines, which is pretty nuts for one science man
[3:12:20] <%FuqBoiSlim> He's killed millions.
[3:12:21] <BlueMoonBlues> It is super canon that Gordon wrecked everyone's shit at Black Mesa
[3:12:25] <%Exiliator> Black mesa is wiiide
[3:12:28] <derap41> Ludo narrative dissonance
[3:12:31] <%Javaa01> Yeah Tomb Raider 2013 was the stupidest shit when it came to that
[3:12:31] <@Solidus_113> Lara caused The Eclipse
[3:12:32] <Zeemod155> no one tell him
[3:12:34] <asurite_warrior> @WoolieVersus They talk about gordan like he's some sort of avenging god in the later games soo maybe more like 100 people
[3:12:35] <%Th3SmartAlec> oof
[3:12:35] <%aceleapc> nah freeman kills hundreds
[3:12:37] <%andrei11dr> Nah ,that suite is REALLY GOOD
[3:12:37] <%GeneralSCPatton> Canonical kill count in the hundreds
[3:12:37] <bluescreen1988> considering freeman being a crazy badass is a major plot point i dont think so
[3:12:41] <Ranger747> cool
[3:12:42] <natebud> Gordon killed so many people that he's practically a messiah by HL2. The man earned his rep
[3:12:43] <dukenux> Okay now, the number of demons DoomGuy killed is absolutely canon OTOH
[3:12:44] <%lewdskeletor13> Doomguy and B.J. have killed thousands
[3:12:49] <+xx123manxx> `that rooms cooler in hl1
[3:12:50] <Visorak6> That was really well scripted
[3:12:55] <Doksumar> Gordon gets turned into a literal Jesus in HL2 because of his deeds in black mesa so all of it is probably true lol
[3:13:01] <unit24> HL2 doesn't make as much sense if gordon didn't kill as many people and creatures as he did in HL1
[3:13:05] <natebud> yeah... @xx123manxx
[3:13:10] <razieltano123> @WoolieVersus In HL2 it is canon that Freeman killed more then 100th of them. no joke.
[3:13:38] <%RioGascar> ...half life alyx even kinda picks fun at his mesiah like status
[3:13:52] <+nawji> thank you reggie
[3:13:54] <+xx123manxx> HLA raises him up higher as god king
[3:13:56] <dukenux> I think his rep in HL2 falls down more on killing the Nihilant and stopping the Xen invasion
[3:13:58] <VJdarkworld> half life 3
[3:13:59] <natebud> all praise man with many guns!
[3:13:59] <%Th3SmartAlec> puzzles PogChamp
[3:14:01] <%Exiliator> Through the cars and the flames
[3:14:15] <dukenux> It's also why Vorts worship him
[3:14:24] <@Solidus_113> through the windows, through the cars
[3:14:26] <natebud> just jump
[3:14:45] <%Irridium> look at this arena
[3:14:52] <%Th3SmartAlec> who's talking?
[3:14:54] <%FuqBoiSlim> EZ Clap
[3:15:16] <natebud> will woolie figure out that right click doesn't home?
[3:15:21] <%Th3SmartAlec> This gun is great aint it Woolie LUL
[3:15:21] <+MaddyCaddy> sipsipSipsipblind
[3:15:23] <+ItsRatman> why is woolie using the 2nd worst weapon in this game?
[3:15:37] <+serranobros> @natebud hahahaha
[3:15:37] <%FuqBoiSlim> it looks cool
[3:15:41] <%RioGascar> Its reliable
[3:15:45] <%andrei11dr> I mean Berserk did a big thing of the protagonist killing a hundred men, but wen you really think about it, that's most main characters in media
[3:15:46] <%RioGascar> it is infinite ammp
[3:15:51] <derap41> These are "alien" aliens
[3:15:58] <natebud> Hivehand is actually too good in this game
[3:16:25] <dukenux> i actually like that hivehand is so good
[3:16:30] <%GeneralSCPatton> @woolieversus RAPID-FIRE BEES DON'T HOME!
[3:16:31] <dukenux> i have a reason to use it
[3:16:39] <natebud> All the soldiers just waddle back and forth endlessly.
[3:16:46] <pennykettle_> so do the aliens actually come from a different dimension? Not just far off space? Kind of weird
[3:17:00] <@Solidus_113> FailFish
[3:17:08] <%Irridium> think it's different dimension
[3:17:09] <%Javaa01> Rapid fire does not have ANY homing ability
[3:17:22] <derap41> They're in my eyes
[3:17:24] <+thackattack00> It is
[3:17:27] <natebud> yeah xen was like a world between dimensions
[3:17:27] <+kewlmyc> THEY'RE IN MY EYES
[3:17:28] <dukenux> Origina had Donald Sutherland
[3:17:29] <derap41> Yeah its godo
[3:17:37] <Ipsenscastle> The Christopher Lee one is great
[3:17:38] <StarlitStunner> It’s good
[3:17:39] <+DreyfussFrost> No homing AT ALL on rapid-fire.
[3:17:41] <pennykettle_> I recommend Wickerman over Midsommar
[3:17:42] <+nawji> mayhap shoot the giant pile of explosives
[3:17:44] <@Solidus_113> rapid fire doesn't home and explodes on contact, regular fire has homing and will bounce if it doesn't hit an enemy
[3:17:47] <derap41> Most bad nick cage movies are just boring
[3:17:49] <astrofalcon1> NOT THE BEES
[3:17:52] <astrofalcon1> AAAAAAAA
[3:18:03] <Ipsenscastle> He refused his paycheck and promoted it heavily because he wanted it to succeed so much. Christopher Lee was the man
[3:18:03] <Visorak6> They have interceptors
[3:18:05] <dukenux> That looks like a San Andreas plane model LUL
[3:18:07] <%Javaa01> No, Gordon does not know how to fly shit
[3:18:07] <Visorak6> Planes are a detahtrap
[3:18:10] <derap41> He has spent a lot of hour flying in simulators
[3:18:11] <oyyzzo> gordon flyman
[3:18:16] <natebud> Get that hint, set those mines!
[3:18:26] <%RioGascar> the government is tracking him and there is an all out war woolie
[3:18:31] <%andrei11dr> It's good, but more of a detective thing than horror
[3:18:31] <%GeneralSCPatton> He can't fly, BUT HE CAN YAMATO-BAR AWAY THE CONCEPT OF GRAVITY!
[3:18:32] <StarlitStunner> The boat can get some sick air in HL2 though @javaa01
[3:18:38] <natebud> And there's fighter jets everywhere
[3:18:55] <astrofalcon1> well that went well

[3:19:42] <natebud> APC for you to crowbar coming up Woolie @WoolieVersus
[3:19:43] <MyNameIsRasus> BRING ME EGGS
[3:19:46] <Visorak6> The soldiers are getting fucked
[3:19:56] <natebud> last one in the game
[3:19:56] <dukenux> yeah, it's a full fledged battle now
[3:19:59] <+theKingRamses> rapid fire for boxes
[3:20:08] <%RioGascar> Its an ALL out war
[3:20:14] <MyNameIsRasus> Monsters... vs. Aliens
[3:20:14] <+MaddyCaddy> Haha
[3:20:25] <natebud> Soldiers will not attack you if there's vortigaunts on screen. Go crazy with the crowbar
[3:20:31] <derap41> Yeah this is proper fucked
[3:20:34] <pennykettle_> you know... gordon freeman's character arc is identical to doomguys...
[3:20:46] <%Exiliator> I mean.. you shot rockets at them
[3:20:51] <%andrei11dr> Ohhh,wach you got comin!
[3:21:00] <%RioGascar> no woolie, its all out war
[3:21:07] <dukenux> If Gordon can't escape...
[3:21:10] <%Javaa01> Yeah those guys were just trying to evac wounded, so uh, Woolie is back on the warcrimes
[3:21:24] <%FuqBoiSlim> WOOOO LETS GOOOO WAR CRIMES
[3:21:33] <%Haarute> two sides enter, gordon prevails.
[3:21:34] <%RioGascar> interesting how i’ve watched EVERY other streamer just watch this fight happen
[3:21:36] <%Exiliator> RAMIREZ! Clear out Black Mesa!
[3:21:40] <%RioGascar> woolie JUMPS IN
[3:21:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> There are heroes on both sides
[3:21:49] <VJdarkworld> heroes on both sides PogChamp
[3:21:53] <gunsrlove> How many Americans have you killed today, Gordon?
[3:21:57] <%Javaa01> Woolie THIRSTS for the sweet taste of warcrimes
[3:22:00] <Talinu> Just wait until HL2.
[3:22:00] <derap41> Hey you gotta remember you invaded them Woolie
[3:22:04] <niddron> cut to half life 2 and something called the 7 hour war
[3:22:06] <Twichty> lol yeah HL2
[3:22:16] <maplemilllk> Why does this game look more and more like doom
[3:22:18] <This_is_Marco> remembers 7 hour war LUL
[3:22:18] <MyNameIsRasus> It's like the Galactic Empire vs. The FPA
[3:22:19] <natebud> bets on if woolie see the soldier thrown through the wall
[3:22:25] <%RioGascar> If aliens attack I WOULD not want them to have teleportation
[3:22:25] <oceanmatt> combine are busted
[3:22:26] <dukenux> "Pondered Freeman, as he blew up last military Osprey they hoped to use to get out"
[3:22:27] <Talinu> Does the 7HW happen now of after HL1?
[3:22:28] <derap41> Yeah don't make is a Doom Eternal invasion
[3:22:33] <This_is_Marco> which is probably what would happen if aliens invaded
[3:22:36] <derap41> Its as weak as in the original
[3:22:36] <%Th3SmartAlec> @maplemilllk Will, we got the flesh growths starting
[3:22:37] <CrimsonSilver4> after HL 1
[3:22:40] <+MaddyCaddy> Sixth sense??
[3:22:40] <%RioGascar> I would rather advanced tech
[3:22:45] <dukenux> Sixth Sense
[3:22:47] <%GeneralSCPatton> Coming to Erf was stupid as hell in Signs
[3:22:52] <%RioGascar> than advanced strategies that we cant counter
[3:22:53] <BlueMoonBlues> The Sixth Element
[3:23:02] <dukenux> But you know about the twist?
[3:23:02] <Doksumar> All of the stuff they throw at you is basically wildlife. It's like us sending tigers to alien worlds lmao
[3:23:02] <Twichty> same
[3:23:04] <natebud> What about Devil?
[3:23:05] <%The_Timo> Fifth sense haha
[3:23:05] <niddron> 7 hour war: got some hits in though...
[3:23:17] <+Troispoint> Unbreakable
[3:23:21] <natebud> The Village
[3:23:21] <%xeromage> day the Village right now
[3:23:30] <This_is_Marco> @Doksumar I thought they were refugees
[3:23:30] <derap41> Avatar which was ass
[3:23:35] <dukenux> 6th Sense and Unbreakable were the good ones
[3:23:37] <Mike_Mc> The Happening was filmed like 20 mins from my house
[3:23:40] <natebud> Avatar was so funny
[3:23:40] <dukenux> and Split i guess
[3:23:43] <%FuqBoiSlim> My first Shyamalan movie was Devil which was alright
[3:23:47] <%andrei11dr> The 5th element is the crazy SF movie with Bruce Willis
[3:23:52] <%The_Timo> AFTER ERFF
[3:23:53] <+Karebuncle> Devil was hilarious
[3:24:03] <VJdarkworld> uh oh
[3:24:06] <+Vancoolness> Split was ok untill the end
[3:24:07] <+DreyfussFrost> Don't underestimate humanity's skill with chemical weapons. Even conventional weapons are chemically powered (gunpowder), and most life forms can't resist high-density solids hitting them at extreme speeds.

[3:55:01] <%Javaa01> It's really not

[3:55:02] <pennykettle_> IT WAS WORSE ORIGINALLY

[3:55:04] <+konekoryugamine> I get on here RIGHT when my ears receive death

[3:55:07] <%Th3SmartAlec> ON FIRE BUTTON
[3:55:10] <+RedKnightVI> Yeah that's a weird Half Life 1 thing
[3:55:10] <+xx123manxx> in HL1 they had you use a XY grid lmao
[3:55:10] <dukenux> *game
[3:55:12] <derap41> They're trying some interactive but its kinda jank
[3:55:16] <razieltano123> @WoolieVersus It was in the original HL1 game.
[3:55:17] <Croetec> werid screen, tells you waht to do exactly Kappa
[3:55:19] <cero_5> it was a lot easier to understand originally
[3:55:20] <dukenux> It was mega janky in HL
[3:55:24] <%RioGascar> it was much worse but still this solution was jank to
[3:55:26] <cero_5> harder to use though
[3:55:27] <natebud> Remember the table they set up in the original?
[3:55:36] <%GeneralSCPatton> @th3smartalec Imagine requiring information from your surroundings in order to navigate reality

[3:55:55] <Daxalog> Prey has you press th ebutton on screen
[3:55:57] <%RioGascar> this sequence would probably work MUCH better in VR
[3:56:00] <%Th3SmartAlec> Reading is hard
[3:56:01] <coreyyotto> It doesn't help that it keeps clipping in and out
[3:56:02] <mMayrro> sorry we're able to read I guess?
[3:56:03] <+aishman> Woolie, you gotta destory the fuel tank
[3:56:05] <Rhinoprotoss> Reading is hard
[3:56:07] <+aishman> Go back!
[3:56:08] <Camail> even tho its a remake this game's still old as sin
[3:56:09] <%andrei11dr> I did say use the screen
[3:56:12] <mistersups> It probably works better not on a TV set up.
[3:56:13] <%Javaa01> This stuff has been in games since Doom 3 in 2004
[3:56:15] <Kiraklene> Reading must be hard LUL
[3:56:24] <+MaddyCaddy> This screen shake is horrible
[3:56:26] <dukenux> wait for it
[3:56:27] <%Javaa01> This is not archaic stuff from a realm long past
[3:56:41] <%Irridium> 2004 was 16 years ago
[3:56:43] <ReyThePCPlayer> it's so scripted lol
[3:56:43] <+RioGascar> I will argue that is
[3:56:48] <%andrei11dr> I guess it was very small to them
[3:56:48] <%xcompleasedad> This is bad
[3:56:49] <dukenux> Are those tungsten rods or what
[3:56:51] <natebud> Like this is actually bad ui, better than HL1 but bad UI
[3:56:51] <@Solidus_113> some Z-fighting
[3:56:52] <someyounguy1> use zoom?
[3:56:56] <%xcompleasedad> Like, the mechanic is AWFUL
[3:56:57] <fangovafang> sound like siren head comin LUL

[3:57:07] <dukenux> Late 90s touchscreens
[3:57:08] <+nawji> Is this an example of something they put into Black Mesa or was this in original HL1?
[3:57:10] <%RioGascar> 2004 was half life 2
[3:57:10] <+RedKnightVI> Blow up the door
[3:57:17] <pennykettle_> nawji in original
[3:57:19] <%RioGascar> This was in og half life 1
[3:57:21] <%Haarute> now again
[3:57:30] <natebud> @nawji It was in the original, but it was a lot easier to understand
[3:57:31] <%RioGascar> And it was kinda more clear
[3:57:33] <maplemilllk> Check out this clip! WoolieVersus streaming Black Mesa! https://clips.twitch.tv/ComfortableSarcasticCheetahSquadGoals
[3:57:36] <+DreyfussFrost> @nawji This sequence was in HL1 but it controlled a little differently.
[3:57:39] <+theomnifed> Couldn't Freeman just jump over that wall ?

[3:58:11] <This_is_Marco> its literally bad UI
[3:58:16] <natebud> good job devs
[3:58:16] <+MaddyCaddy> This section was never good
[3:58:19] <+jiggy_snipe> there was alot goin on with the shaking screen
[3:58:20] <AppleBerryKitty> this really is bs even I had a hard time with this,.
[3:58:20] <Zebroneath> Need to be a green flashing button

[3:58:22] <OldManDeckardCain> oh you'll face the chat but a bee makes you run away LUL
[3:58:24] <+Testfall_V> She screen shake is really contra-productive here
[3:58:25] <%RioGascar> Its bad ui and design
[3:58:25] <derap41> They tried an interactive screen it didn't work
[3:58:25] <+MaddyCaddy> The UI is new though
[3:58:27] <BlueMoonBlues> IIRC it wasn't that bad in the original
[3:58:28] <+YabbaTroll> it should be set to use button honestly
[3:58:28] <%Binary_Fireball> wait I remember going through this exact thing
[3:58:31] <dukenux> :(
[3:58:31] <mikash91> old versions implementation was more clear
[3:58:31] <%Th3SmartAlec> The screen is bad UI, fair. But you still didn't read.
[3:58:31] <Nano_osecond> I prefered the HL1 one
[3:58:32] <%Binary_Fireball> it was so confusing
[3:58:33] <+xx123manxx> it did take me a second to realize myself admittedly @WoolieVersus
[3:58:35] <+Kiaayo> game came out this year but ok
[3:58:35] <%Exiliator> It is bad ui yes, still gonna meme it tho Kappa
[3:58:35] <+MaddyCaddy> In the old game it was an XY grid
[3:58:38] <LeetRunt> I don't remember the scree shake being this bad in this section.
[3:58:39] <Clyderso> btw guys theyre playing on a tv farther away than you would a monitor
[3:58:39] <Twichty> in his defense there hasnt been a touch screen prompt yet
[3:58:39] <This_is_Marco> BabyRage I did it so you should too
[3:58:40] <+BlackSunEmperor> woolie vs weird ui design
[3:58:48] <mistersups> This feels like it would work a lot better on a Computer screen. Not a Couch set up.
[3:58:49] <@Solidus_113> You honestly couldn't read it well with all the screen shake
[3:58:50] <Memdosu> reggie is with you so long as there is no danger
[3:58:53] <%mitchteck> That is dumb
[3:58:55] <+nawji> @WoolieVersus I want you to keep in mind that the way stuff is implemented in Black Mesa may not be an accurate example of how it was in HL1. This is a jank fan made remake after all.
[3:58:55] <resloxxx> We are your greatest allies wools
[3:58:56] <ReyThePCPlayer> i played through this level too and i got confused it's different to the original and more confusing
[3:58:57] <%FuqBoiSlim> okay woolmer
[3:58:58] <Hoot_Patoots> you see a bus you just gotta throw, you know
[3:58:59] <someyounguy1> can someone stop the siren? the wambulance needs to go

[3:59:05] <+xx123manxx> no.

[4:02:37] <Dr_Mooose> weak shit
[4:02:39] <+tussletoes> F
[4:02:39] <natebud> crossbow them woolie
[4:02:45] <dukenux> No, Barney, you look great :)
[4:02:51] <%Javaa01> Nice miss
[4:02:51] <mMayrro> you missed LUL
[4:02:53] <+xx123manxx> missed
[4:02:54] <Visorak6> You shot through his legs
[4:02:55] <Twichty> in magic
[4:02:55] <@Solidus_113> hard miss
[4:02:58] <+Xalgar> Controller Aim LUL
[4:02:58] <+MaddyCaddy> Wasn't that weapon way better?
[4:02:59] <Twichty> in a young girls heart
[4:02:59] <+nawji> woolie shooting through his legs is impressive
[4:03:01] <+paladinstarbuster> HARD WHIFF
[4:03:02] <%Th3SmartAlec> The absolute state of it
[4:03:03] <astrofalcon1> the state of hard misses
[4:03:05] <+nawji> impeccable accuracy in the way he whiffs
[4:03:06] <This_is_Marco> tbh the gauss gun I mostly used to go fast
[4:03:07] <dukenux> The absolute state of Black Mesa
[4:03:09] <natebud> Wouldn't have killed anyway. Tau cannon was neutered
[4:03:13] <Visorak6> shit gun = woolie cant aim
[4:03:16] <Twichty> galoonga
[4:03:18] <StarlitStunner> It’s fuckin RAW
[4:03:22] <%GraceTBM> hivehand fuckin sucks
[4:03:24] <+MaddyCaddy> I thought that was the best gun
[4:03:24] <Volkrotia> Aims for the leg
[4:03:25] <maplemilllk> Was this weapon even in the original?
[4:03:27] <Teh_Un> The Gauss gun is comparable to the rocket launcher at full charge
[4:03:27] <TrashCorner> i think you missed tbh
[4:03:29] <%Th3SmartAlec> That's the smell of a bitch, Barney
[4:03:30] <%Javaa01> Don't blame the gun, blame the shooter
[4:03:32] <+Xalgar> Woolie, this game wasn't balanced around using a controller LUL
[4:03:34] <natebud> he did miss
[4:03:36] <Twichty> ye
[4:03:38] <+xx123manxx> yes theres no new guns in Black mesa
[4:03:41] <%GraceTBM> it was in the original and not very good there either
[4:03:43] <derap41> Its more a feature
[4:03:45] <%Javaa01> Totally shot in between the legs
[4:03:45] <%BubbaRands> It looks flaccid. Maybe fluff it a bit? Kappa
[4:03:46] <+Zanco23> @maplemilllk yes
[4:03:47] <%GeneralSCPatton> ANY GUN IS SHIT IF YOU MISS
[4:03:50] <maplemilllk> Weird stuff
[4:03:50] <%Exiliator> For someone who hates nerds this much, Woolie sure was proud in showing off his anime/video game figure collection before.. Kappa
[4:03:51] <Nano_osecond> it exploded
[4:03:52] <%FuqBoiSlim> hes using a mouse this time at least
[4:03:54] <natebud> It is astonishingly good in the original
[4:04:03] <%GeneralSCPatton> FULL CHARGE IS LIKE A ROCKET
[4:04:04] <%GraceTBM> it feels like a tech demo gun
[4:04:10] <+MaddyCaddy> Can't wait for Woolie to play HL2 and miss with the jeep mounted Tau cannon
[4:04:11] <natebud> Fully changed that thing could kill a tank in one shot
[4:04:11] <%Th3SmartAlec> Man this is all buildup to the DOOM Eternal LP ain't it?
[4:04:14] <%andrei11dr> Woolie expecting Doom 2016 from this game from 98 LUL
[4:04:15] <+aishman> Don't worry Woolie, you'll get THE REAL SIEGE GUN that uses the same energy ammo SOON.
[4:04:17] <Volkrotia> Im sure he'll like the easy Zarya laser
[4:04:22] <natebud> It did the damage of two rockets fully charged!
[4:04:34] <maplemilllk> The best gun in the game is the crowbar
[4:04:34] <dukenux> alien scrotum

[4:06:49] <Streetshark_> is he playing wit the fucking stick?
[4:06:50] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[4:06:55] <pipboy344> Where is he at? Surface Tension?
[4:07:01] <+xx123manxx> forget about freeman
[4:07:03] <alrobot2014> forget about freeman
[4:07:04] <natebud> just crouch

[4:07:15] <ReyThePCPlayer> chevrolet alligator, a movie theater
[4:07:18] <maplemilllk> Surface Tension never ends
[4:07:28] <pipboy344> CROUCH
[4:07:35] <natebud> We made it to Forget thankfully
[4:07:38] <Teh_Un> If only he knew he could convert them\
[4:07:41] <ReyThePCPlayer> it already ended, this is forget Freeman
[4:07:41] <natebud> NotLikeThis
[4:07:47] <This_is_Marco> Jebaited ?
[4:07:59] <pipboy344> WTF
[4:08:04] <maplemilllk> Forget Freeman? I forgot about that level
[4:08:18] <+xx123manxx> how woolie going to shit on the gauss/tau but never stop using the doodoo ass hive hand

[4:08:32] <%RioGascar> Infinite ammo is pretty sick
[4:08:44] <%RioGascar> black mesa EASTTTTTTT
[4:08:49] <+xx123manxx> i only used it when i ran outta ammo on xen LUL
[4:08:49] <natebud> @xx123manxx hivehand is rebalanced to be amazing in this.
[4:08:56] <+tussletoes> to be fair using the tau cannon with a controller must suck. gun's fun otherwise
[4:08:58] <natebud> Just aint right
[4:09:07] <+xx123manxx> he got mouse aim @tussletoes
[4:09:14] <This_is_Marco> @xx123manxx tbf tau cannon was mostly used to rocket propel yourself across the maps
[4:09:16] <ReyThePCPlayer> everybody got something to say, but when they open they're mouths, nothing comes out cuz they forgot about Freeman
[4:09:17] <%GraceTBM> why is black Mesa east in another country on a different continent??
[4:09:18] <%andrei11dr> He just wants to S U C C you
[4:09:24] <@Solidus_113> drowned
[4:09:29] <natebud> He just has to stop charging it, because he keeps missing
[4:09:30] <%Javaa01> They drown
[4:09:31] <mMayrro> drownedcrabs
[4:09:51] <StarlitStunner> Aquacrab
[4:09:53] <natebud> @GraceTBM Why is Prague populated entirely by americans?
[4:10:01] <pipboy344> Because they just call it that for nostalgia
[4:10:02] <maplemilllk> @reythepcplayer I never realized how much I need a Half Life Mixtape until you said those words
[4:10:05] <%GraceTBM> VA limitations
[4:10:08] <Teh_Un> Like the fish in the water
[4:10:18] <MyNameIsRasus> You fuck young boys, Headcrab?
[4:10:19] <%Binary_Fireball> back again
[4:10:21] <pipboy344> has nothing to do with black mesa
[4:10:26] <This_is_Marco> D:
[4:10:39] <EDFscout> also it's "east" from this one. Eastern europe.
[4:10:40] <Teh_Un> Only 1
[4:10:46] <Kiraklene> it was only 1
[4:10:46] <pipboy344> Black Mesa DOES own White Forest
[4:10:51] <%GraceTBM> okay that's a fine explanation. if all the old staff are there, its "black mesa"
[4:10:54] <natebud> These fish are chumps now
[4:10:56] <ReyThePCPlayer> Why do the French in AC Unity have british accents?
[4:10:56] <dukenux> @GraceTBM they called it like that to honor OG Black Mesa. and "East" cause it's in the Eastern Europe
[4:11:11] <+keyoray> is his flashlight on?
[4:11:14] <+xx123manxx> yes
[4:11:16] <natebud> used to take like 6 crossbow shots to kill those guys
[4:11:41] <dukenux> those fuckers still scare me
[4:11:56] <dukenux> i hate fighting enemies in water
[4:11:59] <ReyThePCPlayer> even on hard they die in 2 hits now
[4:12:04] <maplemilllk> So does this mean Portal LP soon PogChamp
[4:12:11] <pipboy344> Fucking hell. I thought he was using a controller. He just sucks at this
[4:12:16] <pennykettle_> Just so you guys know, Hotline Miami 1 OST is getting a vinyl repress this week. its been unavailable for years
[4:12:21] <natebud> Though I did test it in Source and you can stunlock them with the crowbar like in this. LUL
[4:12:43] <maplemilllk> @pennykettle_ I didn't even know that was on vinyl. Right on
[4:12:58] <natebud> will woolie figure it out
[4:13:03] <%Javaa01> No
[4:13:05] <+xx123manxx> go up the other way
[4:13:06] <%Javaa01> Just go around
[4:13:07] <dukenux> if only i had money for it... or a vinyl player
[4:13:08] <+nawji> @pennykettle_ I own the HM1 and 2 vinyls already
[4:13:08] <mMayrro> oh boy
[4:13:17] <pennykettle_> nawji lucky boi
[4:13:17] <natebud> woolie no
[4:13:18] <+nawji> They're pretty nice but the 2 jacket has kinda fallen apart
[4:13:19] <Teh_Un> This area was kinda annoying to navigate to be honest
[4:13:22] <+xx123manxx> just use your special eyes and look at the walls
[4:13:23] <pipboy344> READ CHAT WOOLIE
[4:13:23] <natebud> no
[4:13:24] <%Javaa01> Nope
[4:13:24] <+theKingRamses> there's another path it looks like?
[4:13:25] <dukenux> nah
[4:13:27] <mMayrro> woolie...
[4:13:29] <maplemilllk> More of a CD type guy tbh
[4:13:34] <natebud> i am astounded
[4:13:36] <+xx123manxx> this IS IT CHIEF
[4:13:38] <dukenux> That's not a mechanic
[4:13:40] <%Javaa01> This is it, just go forward instead of the right
[4:13:42] <+xx123manxx> dead ahead of you
[4:13:50] <mMayrro> woolie the path is literally shoving its crotch on your face
[4:13:52] <%andrei11dr> I remember this game being shorter, like around 15 hours but this has been going for a while
[4:13:53] <+theKingRamses> there's more water path?
[4:13:58] <razieltano123> @WoolieVersus Woolie, you have no excusee. There are more space in the water.
[4:13:59] <pipboy344> FORWARD

[4:14:29] <Teh_Un> Steeeeam!!
[4:14:32] <Twichty> steam sale
[4:14:33] <dukenux> Steam(tm)

[4:14:37] <%The_Timo> Valves and steam... huh
[4:14:42] <maplemilllk> So much steam
[4:14:46] <natebud> Yeah woolie is taking it slow
[4:14:47] <dukenux> These damn Valves letting out Steam
[4:14:47] <%Irridium> i get it
[4:14:51] <mMayrro> thanks, Gabriel Newel
[4:15:02] <pipboy344> GayBen
[4:15:22] <Teh_Un> You're doing good woolie for someone who isn't into this type of game genre
[4:15:26] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> BeeCam is back
[4:15:27] <dukenux> Yeah, im not even surprised you're pooped after Surface Tension
[4:15:27] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:15:28] <ReyThePCPlayer> steam sucks, they are not epic... this message brought to you by the great nation of China
[4:15:31] <@Solidus_113> you got maybe 2/3 more streams
[4:15:33] <This_is_Marco> pretty close
[4:15:34] <+YabbaTroll> yeah your about 1/3 of the way through
[4:15:35] <+xx123manxx> you're about 70-80%
[4:15:36] <%GraceTBM> 2/3 throughish
[4:15:37] <+Aeoneth> 60%
[4:15:37] <dukenux> oh, youre getting closer to the Xen
[4:15:42] <%Javaa01> You're like 70% through
[4:15:44] <%andrei11dr> Wow ,i thought we would get to Xen ,today
[4:15:44] <+RedKnightVI> I'd say about a third of the game left
[4:15:46] <natebud> Yeah Xen is like all puzzles too.
[4:15:47] <razieltano123> @WoolieVersus Those that said to Pat that the game is short is a liar.
[4:15:50] <natebud> so even longer
[4:15:50] <%andrei11dr> I was wrong
[4:15:53] <+tussletoes> Xen is huge
[4:15:56] <%Javaa01> Or maybe like 65%
[4:16:01] <pipboy344> Woolie sucks at FPS with mouse
[4:16:03] <dukenux> Xen is longer in this game, for better or worse
[4:16:09] <maplemilllk> Xen is pretty big I heard
[4:16:11] <%Javaa01> You can't hit shit
[4:16:11] <@Solidus_113> you just got bad aim
[4:16:16] <+MaddyCaddy> It's not
[4:16:17] <Nano_osecond> It's called missing
[4:16:18] <This_is_Marco> Rocket jump with it, thats all its good for
[4:16:19] <%Haarute> woolie you MISSED every shot
[4:16:20] <+xx123manxx> you charge it for 3 seconds and you insta kill everything
[4:16:23] <+Aeoneth> You have to HIT
[4:16:24] <derap41> Oof
[4:16:24] <TrashCorner> its one of the best weapons in the game
[4:16:25] <%Binary_Fireball> hahahaha
[4:16:26] <+paladinstarbuster> BAD AIM
[4:16:27] <mMayrro> it's weak because you don't hit the enemies with it LUL
[4:16:27] <CrimsonSilver4> Looking at my HLTB profile it took me 18H to beat Black Mesa.
[4:16:28] <+xx123manxx> you do have cheeks aim you always Miss
[4:16:30] <+nawji> @WoolieVersus that last charge shot you fired, you shot through the guy's legs and missed
[4:16:31] <MonstarGrrrl> OOF
[4:16:32] <%optimasmaximas> just git gud 4Head
[4:16:32] <%Haarute> you just MISSED.
[4:16:32] <%Exiliator> woolieDATTEBAYO
[4:16:33] <+YabbaTroll> you didnt hit body shots tho
[4:16:33] <+tussletoes> Imo Xen is amazing but there's a section near the end that's pretty tedious
[4:16:35] <%Javaa01> You literally haven't hit shit
[4:16:38] <Twichty> u shot between his legs
[4:16:39] <+Max_Kaiser> Max_Kaiser subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[4:16:41] <ReyThePCPlayer> you can rocket jump with the overcharged tau cannon
[4:16:44] <rosemon5001> you really have shit aim sorry
[4:16:45] <Nano_osecond> between the legs is a body shot sometimes
[4:16:45] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @pipboy344
[4:16:45] <Visorak6> Hitting bodyshots on most regular enemies with full charge is instant kill
[4:16:46] <%JonnyFodder> You've been missing a lot woolie.
[4:16:47] <maplemilllk> This would be perfect if he had that Steam Controller
[4:16:49] <Kiraklene> You missed a lot, for real
[4:16:49] <+huggablemantooth> just unload on the enemy with it
[4:16:50] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[4:16:52] <$SirGO0SE> LUL
[4:16:52] <+paladinstarbuster> FABRICATION
[4:16:56] <+Aeoneth> Yes you missed EVERY single one
[4:16:59] <%optimasmaximas> woolieFABRICATION
[4:17:00] <StarlitStunner> You’ve whiffed it
[4:17:00] <pipboy344> YOU ALWAYS MISSED
[4:17:01] <@Solidus_113> The accuracy for that is PINPOINT
[4:17:01] <derap41> Gauss is a very thin beam
[4:17:03] <%GeneralSCPatton> FULLY CHARGED SHOT IS LIKE 2 ROCKETS, BUT YOU MISS EVERY TIME
[4:17:05] <%Javaa01> The only time you hit with it was against the zombies in the collapsed parking garage
[4:17:07] <+theKingRamses> you blew up some bodies at one point
[4:17:07] <%Gamefriendly> is there an in twitch link for the merch?
[4:17:07] <Nano_osecond> test it on a zombie
[4:17:10] <Visorak6> The times you landed full power shots it one shotted
[4:17:12] <Kraahka> You need to use the weapon more
[4:17:14] <natebud> @GeneralSCPatton not anymore
[4:17:19] <%optimasmaximas> your actions will never reach the truth
[4:17:20] <+theKingRamses> between the legs
[4:17:21] <mMayrro> yeah you missed that time
[4:17:21] <+YabbaTroll> in the turret room you shot through his legs
[4:17:24] <+xx123manxx> you missed there
[4:17:24] <ReyThePCPlayer> u can rocket jump with it tho
[4:17:24] <TrashCorner> what you're missing is a keyboard Kappa
[4:17:25] <%Haarute> @WoolieVersus you shot in between the legs of the big boy at the end
[4:17:27] <Visorak6> Through the legs
[4:17:27] <natebud> you missed
[4:17:29] <%Javaa01> You totally missed that shot
[4:17:29] <+nawji> That shot was through the guy's legs
[4:17:31] <pennykettle_> its great against helicopters and some Xen enemies
[4:17:32] <+tussletoes> It's more like a charged rail gun, hard to hit anything with a controller
[4:17:33] <+YabbaTroll> if he had a boner you wouldve removed it
[4:17:33] <natebud> The charge is bad in this. It used to do like crazy damage extra damage if you charged it. You have to use the laser like a machine gun in this. You did miss a lot though. @WoolieVersus
[4:17:35] <Teh_Un> If you hit, that Grunt woulda exploded
[4:17:37] <+sir_louis> Not for you
[4:17:38] <Nano_osecond> it's got impact
[4:17:39] <+theKingRamses> not saying it's great
[4:17:39] <+MaddyCaddy> It's one of the best
[4:17:39] <%Javaa01> If you can aim
[4:17:40] <derap41> The penis is evil
[4:17:41] <pennykettle_> I quite like it
[4:17:43] <pipboy344> 1 CHARGE EQUALS 2 ROCKETS
[4:17:48] <%GeneralSCPatton> High damage no penetration
[4:17:51] <%Haarute> it's the most damaging hit fully charged but it's SUPER precise
[4:17:56] <dukenux> @WoolieVersus Tau canon is a glorified rocket launcher. you can one shot grunts and one-two shot down tanks with charged shot
[4:17:56] <+nawji> Just try and use non charged shots, because if you miss a charged shot you burn a lot of ammo
[4:17:57] <%Javaa01> If you can hit
[4:17:57] <Nano_osecond> try it on a zombie for reference xD
[4:17:58] <+aishman> It's an okay weapon, the one you get that uses the same ammo you get later is WAY better though
[4:17:58] <+xx123manxx> just do what works for you
[4:17:59] <maplemilllk> It charges doe
[4:18:01] <natebud> The charge does not equal 2 rockets in this game
[4:18:05] <ReyThePCPlayer> it's tricky to use
[4:18:07] <natebud> Only the original
[4:18:09] <%Exiliator> Yeah but.. Do combo! Kappa
[4:18:20] <Nano_osecond> it used to overcharge and blow you up in HL1
[4:18:21] <+xx123manxx> if you hold the charge for 2 seconds it insta kills most things
[4:18:23] <+Aeoneth> I just realized Kirby is a mirror and wasnt warping reality
[4:18:25] <%Haarute> it penetrated in the original, but i'm not sure in black mesa
[4:18:26] <+theKingRamses> tanks need kaboom i think
[4:18:28] <%optimasmaximas> psa1guy
[4:18:29] <%Javaa01> You can kill the chopper without using the rocket launcher if you use the charge
[4:18:32] <Kraahka> It's still a lot of damage
[4:18:36] <%SouLucha> Gonna have to lab it then!

[4:18:43] <mMayrro> nerfing weapons in a single player pve game 4Head
[4:18:43] <razieltano123> @WoolieVersus You are about 2/3 the game. Xen is Huge. Like 4 to 6 hours long.
[4:18:45] <dukenux> yeah, it's possible they nerfed it
[4:18:49] <pipboy344> PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[4:18:51] <natebud> One charge used to kill a tank. Not anymore
[4:18:52] <@Solidus_113> I'll redownload the game to do testing
[4:18:57] <%Javaa01> The charged shot does a bit more then the rocket in Black Mesa, but not a full double
[4:19:02] <%Binary_Fireball> @WoolieVersus no on was paying enough attention to say
[4:19:05] <+theKingRamses> you instagibbed the zombies you shot
[4:19:08] <@Moobot> That's a tad too many emotes, @pipboy344 (warning)
[4:19:14] <%Binary_Fireball> like who is watching EVERY shot
[4:19:15] <derap41> Fucking Woolie being all reasonable and shit
[4:19:28] <Nano_osecond> the shot itself has a small hit zone
[4:19:28] <%Binary_Fireball> counting yo shots
[4:19:30] <+xx123manxx> they're def not bad
[4:19:35] <natebud> The charge shot does the same damage as 6 regular shots. Uses the 12 ammo per charge @WoolieVersus
[4:19:46] <+xx123manxx> just hold the charge for 3-4 seconds and youre golden
[4:19:56] <+xx123manxx> it doesnt need to beep unless you wanna get REAL IN THERE
[4:19:59] <razieltano123> @WoolieVersus You are about 2/3 the game. the last level Xen is huge. Like 4 to 6 hours long.
[4:20:00] <%Exiliator> Hey, if you dont like using the gun, dont use it woolieCHAN
[4:20:03] <ReyThePCPlayer> it's powerful charged but negated by the crossbow having a scope
[4:20:04] <This_is_Marco> can also be used to rocket jump if I recall
[4:20:07] <%Javaa01> The uncharged shots are good for going for the head
[4:20:34] <%Javaa01> But uncharged bodyshots aren't a great use of ammo
[4:21:07] <maplemilllk> If woolie runs out of fighting games, he could get us into board games tbh
[4:21:13] <+nawji> Kickstarter also seems great for card game paraphernalia as well, projects for stuff like game mats blow up quick. One I'm part of made like 150k in two weeks.
[4:21:21] <derap41> Black Mesa for example
[4:21:56] <derap41> The good shit there

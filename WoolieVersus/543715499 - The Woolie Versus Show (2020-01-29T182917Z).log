[0:40:17] <+RealThiele> like rin should melt this zipline right?
[0:40:19] <Solidnick18> they are just for the big winter storms
[0:40:27] <Solidnick18> they are useless
[0:40:30] <VidulaSaix> During these Zips might be a good time to talk about your thoughts on the game like you mentioned earlier @WoolieVersus
[0:40:32] <Tucker0603> BB loves this shit

[0:42:15] <Djinnazz> "what you lookin at ghost baby?!"
[0:42:36] <+RealThiele> i wonder how much this game made
[0:43:03] <VidulaSaix> The only stuff you need to do is the pizza thing I'd say
[0:43:08] <+linSP> shoot that ghost baby with a blood rocket!
[0:43:25] <shadowboss89> What's the purpose of doing "orders available" after you have already five stared the place
[0:43:32] <+BoBoGaijin> i thought it had an exclamation point over it if there were orders
[0:43:34] <VidulaSaix> Some give rewards
[0:43:37] <VidulaSaix> Like gold gear
[0:43:40] <Tucker0603> FASTBALL SPECIAL
[0:43:50] <Solidnick18> take a nice hot shower
[0:43:52] <worldbrand> yeah gear or resources i suppose?
[0:43:52] <%Irridium> @shadowboss89 some people give you special items you can only get by delivering to them. postgame it unlocks further emails
[0:43:57] <Solidnick18> FeelsGoodMan
[0:44:02] <+RealThiele> take a shower and get ready for RIDE
[0:44:15] <+jiggy_snipe> with Norman Reedus
[0:44:17] <Djinnazz> You leave your stuff when you teleport.

[0:46:30] <acedeone> hello all
[0:46:37] <worldbrand> porters are a dark beer iirc
[0:46:38] <%mistersups> I dislike IPA's. It's like sucking on a pinecone.
[0:46:43] <+ThaRealJonDo> extremely reedus
[0:46:44] <%oyyzzo> woolieGASM
[0:46:54] <+RealThiele> porters are a darker beer, and they are better than IPAs
[0:46:58] <VidulaSaix> Wow, he looks just like Norman Reedus from the hit TV show Ride with Norman Reedus
[0:47:16] <VidulaSaix> Remember you lose all gear when you teleport
[0:47:36] <%supersugoisenpai1> it might just be a new backpack charm or the rocket launcher you can examine
[0:47:42] <acedeone> yea grab some after jump
[0:47:57] <dukenux> ohai Not'so Fragile
[0:48:11] <peachy996> Fra Gee Lay
[0:48:13] <+RealThiele> fragile using umbrealla tech to teleport, wesker seen fapping furiously
[0:48:22] <+Stupid121v2> new chapter new heartman
[0:48:26] <%Irridium> I don't know if it happens post-game or not but you could pay a visit to elder for a thing.once you're done delivering pizza
[0:48:35] <acedeone> lol @realthiele
[0:48:56] <dukenux> what's scary, Wesker would fit well in DS universe i thing
[0:49:02] <dukenux> *think
[0:49:05] <+Deepfriedhamster> I am super interested to see them in the later third of this adventure
[0:49:07] <+RealThiele> he would be like bakker
[0:49:10] <+Stupid121v2> Wesker is DOOMS level 100
[0:49:17] <%GeneralSCPatton> Yeah, use the fart gas dimension
[0:49:32] <Tucker0603> @dukenux complete global SATURATION
[0:49:36] <+Deepfriedhamster> Why is Sam's Dooms so weak...he can kinda feel ghosts
[0:49:36] <@Solidus_113> gather more at one point
[0:49:41] <+thesw1tch> wesker running reallt fast is the best teleport
[0:49:46] <+RealThiele> sams dooms are story related
[0:49:50] <worldbrand> i like it when it's kept simple, like king allant or ornstein's dashes
[0:50:00] <acedeone> DOOMS ASSIT ME
[0:50:11] <+Deepfriedhamster> naybe his slow down power in combat is dooms

[0:57:24] <+thesw1tch> you rolled up on them

[0:57:31] <+QueequegTheater> I don't
[0:57:40] <worldbrand> it'd be kinda fucked up but hey
[0:57:44] <+RealThiele> shoot criminals into space so the void out there

[0:59:16] <vVAstrAVv> !uptime
[0:59:16] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 59 minutes and 18 seconds
[0:59:21] <+Deepfriedhamster> yeah its awesome
[0:59:25] <Mothman742> @dukenux ur awesome
[0:59:26] <+Deepfriedhamster> harmonica for lyfe
[0:59:26] <%kyh9> Tea Bags are a type of Strand too
[0:59:30] <%Irridium> and then they get your balls across their face
[0:59:35] <%The_Timo> Lol you are a chump, Sam however is not
[0:59:37] <%supersugoisenpai1> I imagine sam wearing his gold glasses and baseball cap, drinking a Monster while T-bagging a Mule
[0:59:38] <+Mkingston> Postman always knocks twice. Bang Bang
[0:59:47] <+Deepfriedhamster> the T in tea is for sTrands
[0:59:48] <worldbrand> if you saw sam carrying that many packages, just running over the hills at full sprint like the ocarina of time postman, you would stay out of sight
[0:59:54] <@Solidus_113> deliver deez nuts on your chin
[1:00:06] <+BionoidLCR> Dam solidus
[1:00:12] <%kyh9> "Sam. isn't it interesting how Tea Bags have strands"
[1:00:31] <Picosunloaded> Break your neck with deez nuts
[1:00:34] <+Deepfriedhamster> they say the ancient people drank tea together to share in a community setting
[1:00:43] <peachy996> You must keep delivering to find that answer
[1:00:53] <+ThaRealJonDo> "the strings on tea bags are actually 53,000 year old umbilical cords"
[1:01:03] <+Deepfriedhamster> they tie us tot he tea
[1:01:05] <+RealThiele> real fact: the american founding fathers were almost out of tea, and so turned the entire boston harbor into a teapot
[1:01:17] <+Deepfriedhamster> TEA is FREEDOM
[1:01:20] <acedeone> Lou enjoys flying at dangerous speeds lol
[1:01:24] <peachy996> Boston Harba
[1:01:28] <+Mkingston> Why is Woolie back here?
[1:01:33] <masterfire23> i love sams double jump its so goofy
[1:01:37] <+Deepfriedhamster> hes exploring
[1:01:43] <+ThaRealJonDo> this game would be cooler if the ziplines were rails you grind with a skateboard
[1:01:51] <%GeneralSCPatton> You think any fish died of caffeine overdose in the Boston Harbor?
[1:01:57] <worldbrand> i did not know you could control that
[1:02:00] <+Deepfriedhamster> oh man
[1:02:05] <worldbrand> i have fallen down mountains
[1:02:06] <+Deepfriedhamster> green tea Fish
[1:02:16] <%Soulbishop> What in the Sunset overdrive?
[1:02:17] <+Deepfriedhamster> in real life or in game?
[1:02:33] <worldbrand> in the game, everyone knows mountains arent real
[1:02:37] <+RealThiele> falling down a mountain irl is probably death
[1:02:41] <peachy996> Our Founding Fathers would be shocked if they tasted our tea now
[1:02:47] <+Mkingston> @ThaRealJonDo this game would be cooler if you were Spider-Man
[1:02:52] <+ThaRealJonDo> very true
[1:03:02] <+RealThiele> just be sonic and grind the zipline for rings
[1:03:04] <+Deepfriedhamster> this game would be cooler in a fridge
[1:03:20] <%The_Timo> "How do they float that high?" Bitch they fucking float lol, as high as they want
[1:03:30] <worldbrand> this game would be cooler in unreal engine with basic assets in a generic grassy field
[1:03:43] <+Deepfriedhamster> maybe they're goin tovisit a specific prepper
[1:03:54] <+RealThiele> this game was definitely not what people were expecting
[1:03:56] <+Deepfriedhamster> the forest is best with a bridge
[1:04:10] <VidulaSaix> I think it's exactly what people were expecting
[1:04:11] <VidulaSaix> Delivery man
[1:04:16] <+RealThiele> i feel like this is what a survival game becomes with a $50 mil budget
[1:04:20] <+Deepfriedhamster> @RealThiele but did it deliver LUL
[1:04:26] <+RealThiele> LUL
[1:04:49] <+Deepfriedhamster> if he re uses the engine for ther stuff
[1:04:50] <worldbrand> i went through the hole
[1:04:52] <+Deepfriedhamster> then its awesome
[1:05:05] <+Deepfriedhamster> was the hole moist
[1:05:10] <+RealThiele> yea this engine has a lot of potential, and osny said it was a commercial success
[1:05:21] <worldbrand> it rains a lot over there so yes, the hole is often moist
[1:05:29] <worldbrand> i put a safehouse on that clfif over there. there's nothing up there btw
[1:05:40] <+RealThiele> dunno if woolie can see chat atm
[1:05:43] <+Deepfriedhamster> there is that spot

[1:07:43] <VidulaSaix> There's repeatable deliveries
[1:07:45] <alrobot2014> woolie shall deliver us from evil
[1:07:53] <worldbrand> I like to believe this works with SBR rules and if you get really good at delivering, it just becomes a stand
[1:07:54] <@Solidus_113> The standard orders to start to pop back up
[1:08:16] <+Deepfriedhamster> isn't Sam BB's Stand technically
[1:08:37] <%GeneralSCPatton> @deepfriedhamster Strando Powah
[1:08:56] <VidulaSaix> You get Mails for the non important ones
[1:09:11] <+Deepfriedhamster> hoho you're approaching me? I need to get closer to deliver this package.

[1:10:29] <+Deepfriedhamster> oh he's on the first island
[1:10:35] <+Razputin217> Dancing Mad Mads
[1:10:41] <Mothman742> chat do u prefer ur cheese pizzas with blue cheese and anchovies or with gummy worms?
[1:10:49] <+Deepfriedhamster> worms
[1:10:52] <+Deepfriedhamster> gimme the worms
[1:10:53] <peachy996> That one episode of Community where its ABBA Zombie Apocalypse is still hilarious
[1:10:53] <VidulaSaix> A good general rule of thumb is that once you've 5 starred someone they wont give you anything unique beyond maybe an email
[1:11:11] <+Deepfriedhamster> i did forget to get the charm from the weather station
[1:11:23] <+Javaa01> Oh yeah, this is simple, just go nade some BTs and grab their crystals, then go drop those crystals off at the destination
[1:11:23] <@Solidus_113> use the grenades as a test
[1:11:29] <VidulaSaix> Thats the main mission
[1:11:38] <VidulaSaix> Not the one you're on
[1:11:45] <%GeneralSCPatton> That's the damn test run grenade tutorial
[1:11:49] <+Javaa01> You don't need to fight a boss for this, the regular floating BTs are enough
[1:12:02] <VidulaSaix> Yeah this is the tutorial mission lol
[1:12:06] <%Irridium> yeah finally test the grenades you've been using most of the game already
[1:12:29] <@Solidus_113> this is why you read the mission log
[1:12:37] <@Solidus_113> It's a tutorial mission
[1:12:43] <+Javaa01> This is a tutorial mission from earlier on in the game
[1:12:45] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:12:45] <VidulaSaix> Because it's the Tutorial Mission. Go To The BT Area is the main mission on the other continent @WoolieVersus
[1:12:56] <This_is_Marco> I also did this mission in the late game LUL
[1:13:09] <+Deepfriedhamster> same
[1:13:10] <worldbrand> LUL
[1:13:14] <worldbrand> same im pretty sure
[1:13:29] <+Deepfriedhamster> this mission emned up fucking me hard though
[1:13:37] <peachy996> find a jelly
[1:13:53] <Solidnick18> LIGHTING
[1:13:58] <%Irridium> VANILLA ICE?!
[1:14:02] <Solidnick18> PogChamp
[1:14:10] <This_is_Marco> monkaS
[1:14:11] <Solidnick18> i saw it
[1:14:15] <%Irridium> I actually saw that once in my game as well. No fucking clue what it is.
[1:14:17] <BallerSwagBro9k> lIGHTNING rETURNS
[1:14:20] <+Deepfriedhamster> i went BT hunting in the snow once
[1:14:21] <%Irridium> saw it in the mountains
[1:14:24] <+Deepfriedhamster> shit gets cray
[1:14:37] <ALTRNico> !uptime
[1:14:38] <VidulaSaix> Looked like a visual glitch
[1:14:39] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 14 minutes
[1:14:40] <+Deepfriedhamster> i went looking for rare BTs
[1:14:41] <VidulaSaix> Just looked at it
[1:14:43] <+linSP> what would chiral lightning do to you monkaS
[1:14:44] <+Deepfriedhamster> neer foudn any though
[1:14:46] <%supersugoisenpai1> I believe that's other player's stuff being dropped in your world, I've seen it on my ziplines
[1:14:47] <+Javaa01> Nah, they're a bit further in I think
[1:15:11] <%LordSDB> Woolie doing a genocider run?! PogChamp
[1:15:21] <ALTRNico> Woolie's back in the first area?
[1:15:22] <red_blaster> That lightning was another player's cargo dropping into your world. There is a little animation for it.
[1:15:26] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @bevyrage
[1:15:28] <@Solidus_113> closer to the water
[1:15:30] <%Irridium> Think they hang just in the eastern part of the circle
[1:15:40] <bevyrage> aw, not even clips
[1:15:42] <%GeneralSCPatton> @linsp That's how you make a Frankenstein's monster, or a Heartman
[1:15:52] <Djinnazz> go towards the water
[1:16:12] <BurdRightsActivist> Why did wools go all the way back? Lol
[1:16:13] <+Javaa01> I think collecting the crystals is enough to complete the objective, if you've already cleared the area out
[1:16:18] <+Neale2theMusic> Reading up now that lightning was the game spawning lost cargo from another world
[1:16:26] <+Deepfriedhamster> did you know that ancient humans drank water
[1:16:35] <+Deepfriedhamster> Sam dont you think thats interesting
[1:16:35] <VidulaSaix> Yeah I'm pretty sure you can't do this anymore cause you killed it LUL
[1:16:37] <%Who_lio42> SE in the circle
[1:16:46] <worldbrand> whaat
[1:16:49] <+Mkingston> It's true
[1:16:51] <arkv01> isekai cargo
[1:16:53] <%Irridium> cargo getting isakai'd
[1:16:54] <alrobot2014> isecargo
[1:17:05] <@Solidus_113> grab crystals
[1:17:09] <@Solidus_113> this is the actual mission
[1:17:09] <arkv01> all the cargo you drop down cliffs...
[1:17:11] <red_blaster> Yeah, there is a little animation for another player's cargo showing up in your world.
[1:17:21] <Solidnick18> idk
[1:17:35] <thebushmanisback> It always freaked me out how much that bracelet gets treated like billys cuffs from re-0
[1:17:40] <+Deepfriedhamster> i want a chiral Katana
[1:17:54] <%Who_lio42> SE in the circle irrc
[1:18:02] <+Deepfriedhamster> Katana means japanese Strand
[1:18:08] <BallerSwagBro9k> RACE WAR WOOLIE AT IT AGAIN
[1:18:10] <%supersugoisenpai1> I don't think this mission gives you anything anyway
[1:18:17] <arkv01> BT APARTHEID
[1:18:20] <VidulaSaix> Just abandon. Pretty sure you've 100%'d this contient
[1:18:21] <mankeyfigh> Did Woolie change his mind about Spec Ops today?
[1:18:23] <%Soulbishop> South East. . .
[1:18:25] <%Irridium> south-east?
[1:18:26] <+Javaa01> Yeah, that should probably be enough, check the delivery point and drop off the crystals
[1:18:33] <VidulaSaix> No Spec Ops today due to scheduling issues. Spec Ops will be tomorrow.
[1:18:36] <+Javaa01> You don't need to abandon it though
[1:18:44] <+Mkingston> @Deepfriedhamster Like we wanted to unlock the Katana in MGS2 and use it in NG+.
[1:19:08] <+Deepfriedhamster> playing throough Death stranded with spoilers ON must be weird
[1:19:09] <%Who_lio42> yeah weird they must be gone.
[1:19:14] <%Irridium> you can go further south. maybe. hopefully.
[1:19:16] <VidulaSaix> Boy this episode is going to play GREAT on Youtube LUL
[1:19:30] <+Deepfriedhamster> its fiiine
[1:19:34] <Djinnazz> You would have seen them by now
[1:19:39] <+Deepfriedhamster> just see if you can deliver tsome crystals
[1:19:46] <%LordSDB> Woolie will make you extinct chat
[1:19:49] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:19:50] <Solidnick18> woolies just to strong now
[1:19:50] <ALTRNico> can you not restart the mission in the Order menu?
[1:19:54] <%LordSDB> Don't test this man
[1:19:56] <@Solidus_113> guess this is just roaming timefall and not a BT-caused one
[1:19:57] <+thesw1tch> such is the totality of life
[1:20:01] <%GeneralSCPatton> Try another BT zone?
[1:20:01] <peachy996> They're KNOT coming back?
[1:20:07] <VidulaSaix> haHAA
[1:20:08] <+Deepfriedhamster> also if he rests at a time shelter, wont they respaqn
[1:20:08] <+Javaa01> Yeah, just check the end delivery point and go drop off those crystals there, should be enough to cross this mission off considering how many crystals you got here
[1:20:11] <%Soulbishop> I would say rest first then see if that triggers a respawn
[1:20:15] <BallerSwagBro9k> Woolie "BT Cleansing" Madden
[1:20:17] <acedeone> why Knot
[1:20:19] <Djinnazz> Central
[1:20:26] <VidulaSaix> Its really not worth all this effort. It's just a tutorial mission LUL
[1:20:42] <+Deepfriedhamster> I'm telling you this mission also fucked me
[1:20:45] <@Solidus_113> the order is in your menu
[1:20:55] <+Mkingston> Oh, I remember this. It was raining and had BTs in this area for me.
[1:20:56] <+Deepfriedhamster> execute order 66
[1:20:59] <+Deepfriedhamster> BT genocide
[1:21:21] <+linSP> wait tutorial? doesnt it require him make a postbox in the circle
[1:21:30] <VidulaSaix> There's multiple
[1:21:34] <+Deepfriedhamster> no, its to test the blood bombs
[1:21:42] <VidulaSaix> A good general rule of thumb is that once you've 5 starred someone they wont give you anything unique beyond maybe an email
[1:21:56] <+Javaa01> Basically every new gadget has a tutorial
[1:21:56] <+Deepfriedhamster> #pizza time
[1:22:04] <+linSP> ohhh, cant do the mission if all the ghosts are dead :(
[1:22:08] <+Mkingston> Yep. Once 5 starred abandon them.
[1:22:24] <BallerSwagBro9k> UCK IT QUADRUPLE JUMP
[1:22:28] <VidulaSaix> Just jump 4Head
[1:22:36] <worldbrand> triple jump but two of those jumps are actual supernatural double jumps
[1:22:47] <+Mkingston> How to make Lara naked back in the day
[1:22:50] <BallerSwagBro9k> MOONJUMP THO
[1:22:50] <%LordSDB> Now I want to see woolie play Lighting Return, just to see him do a full genocide run on that
[1:22:53] <+Deepfriedhamster> slam dunk BB for style points
[1:23:08] <alrobot2014> if someone did a real life double jump i'd give em an award
[1:23:13] <+BioHunter> bad analogy is bad lol
[1:23:14] <@Solidus_113> back to pizza town
[1:23:14] <%GeneralSCPatton> But there's skill and technique to how you spring off of the landing and conserve momentum.
[1:23:20] <ALTRNico> getting the pole in the hole?
[1:23:24] <Solidnick18> pole in the hole
[1:23:28] <arkv01> pole and hole huh :)
[1:23:33] <%Irridium> pizza pizza
[1:23:37] <+Deepfriedhamster> pole the hole to get the right angle
[1:23:39] <+Mkingston> He has a pizza mission available?
[1:23:45] <NotHereToStream> pizza time
[1:23:50] <dukenux> does triple jump makes you jump farther than long jump?
[1:24:06] <+Mkingston> Space Jump
[1:24:09] <+Javaa01> Most sports have dumb arbitrary rules, triple jump just puts in the name
[1:24:12] <+Deepfriedhamster> triple jump into my arms
[1:24:25] <arkv01> wht about that one anime where robots played basketball
[1:24:27] <%mistersups> Basketball but with 3 balls.
[1:24:34] <+BoBoGaijin> each jump could go in different directions though sajamSegue3 sajamSegue4
[1:24:44] <worldbrand> yo i would watch that
[1:24:47] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:24:52] <peachy996> Multi-Ball
[1:24:52] <+Mkingston> Have you seen Slam Ball?
[1:24:56] <+Deepfriedhamster> did you know the spear in spear throwing has been designed to be less effective so that its more difficult to hit a far distance
[1:24:58] <+jiggy_snipe> that would be nuts
[1:25:03] <ALTRNico> Woolie "three balls sounds fun" Madden
[1:25:05] <dukenux> more like 2 balls and 4 goals
[1:25:05] <arkv01> hell yeah dodge ball basketball edition
[1:25:06] <@Solidus_113> Farm?
[1:25:09] <VidulaSaix> Farm
[1:25:12] <%Irridium> timefall farm?
[1:25:12] <Djinnazz> FARM
[1:25:13] <+Mkingston> The farm
[1:25:14] <+Deepfriedhamster> #farm pizza
[1:25:19] <%Soulbishop> I wonder. . . what's the oxygen concentration is like in the world at this point
[1:25:22] <+Deepfriedhamster> this one sucks if its the farm
[1:25:26] <+Sebenoth> timefall farm
[1:25:31] <%Irridium> oh this gonna be fun
[1:25:31] <@Solidus_113> Check around the farm for a safe house, there's usually one pretty close
[1:25:35] <+Mkingston> This is the hardest pizza mission
[1:25:37] <%supersugoisenpai1> you can check the last email from Peter
[1:25:40] <%Soulbishop> Rainforest cant be putting out max oxygen at this point
[1:25:48] <+drfaustisdead> yeah the farm one is the worst.
[1:25:58] <ALTRNico> Is this the one where you're supposed to carry the champagne?
[1:26:03] <+Deepfriedhamster> shhh
[1:26:07] <%TheSleepParty> Nah the pizza.
[1:26:17] <+Deepfriedhamster> pizza farmers need unions
[1:26:22] <@Solidus_113> You REALLY WANT a speed skeleton for this one
[1:26:23] <Prevot> most of the oxygen comes from algae, so it depends on how good the oceans are doing
[1:26:39] <worldbrand> three houses PogChamp
[1:26:43] <VidulaSaix> I just said fuck it and took a bike @Solidus_113 LUL

[1:28:30] <+Deepfriedhamster> that Rock is a BT
[1:28:32] <+chesterr01> do we need to see the elder?
[1:28:36] <+agumon9000> No one tells Woolie

[1:28:42] <+thesw1tch> no the mules just don't like sam
[1:28:45] <@Solidus_113> nah he's been 5 star for a long time
[1:28:47] <VidulaSaix> Just do pizza stuff
[1:28:50] <%Irridium> if you deliver a package to him something neat happens

[1:30:43] <@Solidus_113> Carrier would keep it flat
[1:30:54] <+linSP> gotta run fast
[1:30:55] <+drfaustisdead> I just put an XL item in my pack and the pizza stayed flat.
[1:30:58] <+Mkingston> you can't just carry the pizza
[1:31:02] <+Deepfriedhamster> the fun is in having the chance of failure
[1:31:05] <%Black_Machete> carrier and speed skeleton

[1:33:53] <+Sebenoth> roads and generators will make it fine
[1:33:58] <+Mkingston> Just run around the mules
[1:33:58] <peachy996> Your feet are getting pretty relaxed with all those vehicles and ziplines, it'd be a shame if you had to hand deliver something Kappa
[1:33:58] <+Razputin217> PIZZA TIME
[1:34:02] <+Deepfriedhamster> Forrest gump the game
[1:34:05] <vVAstrAVv> battery recharges even if it dies

[1:34:19] <%LordSDB> Watch out for rocks
[1:34:21] <@Solidus_113> Wow, didn't expect to hear Billy Talent today
[1:34:23] <+Mkingston> How many hours has Woolie put into this game?
[1:34:32] <peachy996> many
[1:34:34] <@Solidus_113> like 150
[1:34:46] <+Deepfriedhamster> i ended at 135 hrs
[1:34:51] <+Razputin217> Barry Sanders that pizza
[1:34:54] <+Deepfriedhamster> probably couldve done it in 60
[1:34:56] <+Mkingston> I ended at 63
[1:34:56] <Djinnazz> did you bould all the roads?
[1:35:14] <+Deepfriedhamster> i spent 2 hours in the snow before unlocking mountain knot
[1:35:20] <+Javaa01> You should be able to outrun them
[1:35:25] <%chronoxgp> i ended at 60
[1:35:27] <Prevot> alexa play run run rottytops
[1:35:28] <+Mkingston> I didn't build everything and only 5 starred about 3 people
[1:35:42] <+Deepfriedhamster> anyone done a newgame + with spoilers on?
[1:35:54] <%LordSDB> Woolie been going for 5 staring people so yeah he's been at it
[1:35:57] <+Deepfriedhamster> you really dont need to 5 star anyone
[1:36:01] <%chronoxgp> I did the whole game without online or the HUD, it was great, lost track of time
[1:36:02] <acedeone> not yet no
[1:36:10] <+Deepfriedhamster> no HUD?
[1:36:11] <+Mkingston> I had spoilers on throughout my first run. Never got spoiled.
[1:36:17] <+Deepfriedhamster> really
[1:36:18] <%Irridium> should be fine if you just go straight north
[1:36:27] <peachy996> Reluctantly crouched at the starting line Engines pumping and thumping in time
[1:36:27] <%Irridium> follow the coast
[1:36:31] <%Who_lio42> theres a shallow path infront of the waterfall
[1:36:32] <+Deepfriedhamster> thats so weird i wouldve hoped the mpa blew up with ziplines int he first mission
[1:36:36] <%chronoxgp> the entire game is color/auditory you don't need HUD at all
[1:36:52] <+Deepfriedhamster> i like knowing my bbs mood
[1:37:03] <%LordSDB> Making the game harder can be really fun @Deepfriedhamster I like playing some shooters without huds when I can. But not all of them
[1:37:20] <+Deepfriedhamster> hmm

[1:38:25] <+Deepfriedhamster> im surprised he didnt go through the weather station
[1:38:32] <+Deepfriedhamster> but this si more interesting
[1:38:46] <+Sebenoth> that's the point, you're not supposed to know
[1:38:51] <%Who_lio42> you either cut infront of the waterfall, or go to the weather station
[1:38:52] <VidulaSaix> Restarting it wiuld just make it take longer at this point

[1:39:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> Aren't crystals a valid repair material?
[1:39:57] <%Irridium> don't generators just need chiral crystals?
[1:39:58] <+Javaa01> Well, not far to the road now
[1:39:59] <@Solidus_113> The battery will charge in the sun
[1:40:02] <+Deepfriedhamster> does it need materials or just hciral crystals. can i get a confirmation
[1:40:04] <%LordSDB> That was making me way to nervous
[1:40:07] <+JacknZack27> You can use crystals to repair

[1:56:03] <+JacknZack27> You can repair with only crystals. You dont need metal
[1:56:30] <+Sebenoth> ...its something Kojima eluded to with "ignoring early game NPCs" as a mechanic
[1:56:36] <%Irridium> if you upgrade it it also heals it completely
[1:56:40] <peachy996> You won't be locked from the pizza mission don't worry
[1:56:41] <Quinnman89> while Upgrading is the optimal way to repair, you can also just dump materials in
[1:57:29] <ALTRNico> main mission go
[1:57:34] <@Solidus_113> This current main isn't a lockoff point
[1:57:37] <worldbrand> it sure is
[1:57:40] <VidulaSaix> Yeah dont worry
[1:57:41] <%supersugoisenpai1> do main story missions for more pizza time
[1:57:42] <VidulaSaix> You've got time

[1:59:10] <vVAstrAVv> hey some of us prefer to play the game rather than stare at vehicle customizations
[1:59:15] <+JacknZack27> I always go with default color. Too lazy to customize a vehicle that’ll get ditched soon anyway
[1:59:27] <peachy996> What do you think this is Midnight Club 3?

[2:02:03] <worldbrand> LUL
[2:02:13] <MayorRev> Modern problems require modern solutions

[2:05:27] <MayorRev> disrespectful parking
[2:05:39] <+Mkingston> Imagine how bad this game could potentially get with PC modding

[2:06:25] <MayorRev> that road is gooped up
[2:06:46] <%allups> u mean good with modding

[2:07:42] <MayorRev> thousands of porters zipping and driving
[2:07:47] <VidulaSaix> No Spec Ops today due to scheduling issues. Spec Ops will be tomorrow.
[2:07:47] <ALTRNico> confirm it now
[2:07:54] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> ahh ok
[2:07:55] <+Mkingston> Imagine if people could invade your game
[2:07:59] <+Javaa01> Nah, just the Distro center
[2:07:59] <%GeneralSCPatton> I want to see mods for no-stumble, hyper boost, and infinite double jump.

[2:09:07] <acedeone> thats nothing, I killed a MULE by accident in the northern part of the map, was told he was going to pop a BT then I ran out of the area, it didnt
[2:09:07] <peachy996> I mean Death Stranding
[2:09:19] <acedeone> trigger, and then triggered a game over when I returned automatically
[2:09:19] <xSettingSunx> She wants you to Ka in her Ha
[2:09:41] <+Mkingston> He's gone full Pat
[2:09:42] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1222044563210145793?s=19

[2:10:25] <MayorRev> burger
[2:10:27] <+Mkingston> Tina!
[2:10:27] <@Solidus_113> @acedeone Killing people takes legitimately 48 hours to spawn a BT
[2:10:49] <+Javaa01> Twist the map
[2:10:52] <@Solidus_113> and it's an instant game over when that happens
[2:10:54] <+Javaa01> Look at the actual topology
[2:11:03] <acedeone> wooow I though this whole time the game just didnt trigger it
[2:11:36] <+Mkingston> I'd love Woolie to come across something of Pat's and delete it
[2:11:40] <peachy996> Hold that L
[2:11:42] <Quinnman89> you can, you just can't be using a zip line. oh noo
[2:11:42] <acedeone> you can delete actually but it doesnt free up bandwith
[2:11:55] <+Javaa01> Nah, all of Pat's shit is dead and gone by this point
[2:11:57] <ALTRNico> yes
[2:11:59] <derap41> yup
[2:12:00] <Tucker0603> yep
[2:12:00] <VidulaSaix> If you die yes
[2:12:01] <worldbrand> Who knows
[2:12:03] <NotHereToStream> yes
[2:12:03] <+BionoidLCR> yes it does
[2:12:10] <+drfaustisdead> yep
[2:12:11] <+linSP> online structures are free
[2:12:14] <%GeneralSCPatton> Yes
[2:12:17] <%The_Timo> Well give it a test , go for it, do it
[2:12:18] <+JacknZack27> Yeah
[2:12:19] <+johnny_gogo> Yup
[2:12:20] <+BionoidLCR> it does that
[2:12:22] <VidulaSaix> You can crater a lot of the map
[2:12:23] <%The_Timo> just wait forever lol
[2:12:23] <VidulaSaix> Its dope
[2:12:24] <derap41> all of that happens
[2:12:26] <yousayyugi> do it
[2:12:27] <acedeone> It does I believe, a voidout creates a crater
[2:12:29] <%Who_lio42> woolie says this as he passed a cratered area
[2:12:43] <vVAstrAVv> i heard its not "permanent but a long time probably
[2:12:44] <@Solidus_113> He means what I just replied to
[2:12:45] <derap41> yeah the craters on the world map are void outs
[2:12:47] <VidulaSaix> Its permanent
[2:12:48] <derap41> and some nukes
[2:12:57] <@Solidus_113> He means killing MULEs and terrorists
[2:13:00] <ALTRNico> well no
[2:13:02] <acedeone> Kojima has always been very anti-kill
[2:13:05] <@Solidus_113> the answer is no
[2:13:05] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> they return
[2:13:06] <worldbrand> thinking emoji
[2:13:10] <MayorRev> LUL
[2:13:12] <acedeone> you often get rewarded for doing so
[2:13:19] <+linSP> everytime you get dragged by a bt, where you appear will turn into a hole if you die
[2:13:20] <VidulaSaix> Not quite. The voidouts are only possible in BT areas
[2:13:26] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus mules, no the become new BTs
[2:13:33] <+drfaustisdead> I just had a MULE just die for no reason once.
[2:13:46] <VidulaSaix> 2 hours later we're back where we started
[2:13:52] <VidulaSaix> I love this game LUL
[2:14:02] <duskrush> how far is he?
[2:14:06] <VidulaSaix> Ch 8
[2:14:07] <MayorRev> gg
[2:14:25] <VidulaSaix> Oh damn recording stopped again
[2:14:29] <+linSP> i think its safe to say woolie will never see a gold bt because hes too good
[2:14:45] <%wydamn> Empty that SD card, let all the video fall onto the floor
[2:14:55] <peachy996> Empty your load
[2:14:59] <worldbrand> video's haunted
[2:15:01] <duskrush> oh shit he's got the mission to get to the edge of the tar lake?
[2:15:03] <NotHereToStream> Kojima is like no spoiler plz
[2:15:04] <+drfaustisdead> Woolie Will Manage the Data.
[2:15:15] <ALTRNico> recording is haunted by BT
[2:15:16] <VidulaSaix> Definitely sounds like a capacity issue
[2:15:17] <Riorii> yeah luckily worst case you have the vod
[2:16:30] <derap41> Spec ops?
[2:16:41] <VidulaSaix> No Spec Ops today due to scheduling issues. Spec Ops will be tomorrow.
[2:17:02] <+BoBoGaijin> sajamHoop

[2:17:34] <+Stupid121v2> At least we have the stream footage :/
[2:17:36] <Solidnick18> BibleThump
[2:17:36] <+BoBoGaijin> wait what happened?
[2:17:38] <+johnny_gogo> Fuck
[2:17:38] <%wydamn> Tell minh to recreate the footage with stickman drawings.
[2:17:40] <+jiggy_snipe> can you throw up the twitch vod?
[2:17:43] <arkv01> good thing we have strim footage these days
[2:17:43] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Minh can save it via stream footage?
[2:17:45] <+Mkingston> You're not a professional streamer unless you have technical problems
[2:17:50] <VidulaSaix> Facts
[2:17:54] <+linSP> at least theres twitch vod
[2:18:00] <Solidnick18> yeah
[2:18:04] <arkv01> time to get a new SD card rip
[2:18:04] <+Stupid121v2> $$$
[2:18:08] <VidulaSaix> No backups around the house?
[2:18:11] <OldManDeckardCain> enemies from within SabaPing
[2:18:13] <derap41> bad sectors on SD card are a nightmare
[2:18:36] <arkv01> finally, the time of VOD supremacy has arrived
[2:18:36] <+Stupid121v2> Its the principal
[2:18:38] <@Solidus_113> Does anything get shut down when you finish recording?
[2:18:39] <%wydamn> Must be one of those Sansumg brand SD cards.
[2:19:12] <+Mkingston> Dammit Billy
[2:19:19] <+snarfton23> Play Uno for the rest of the stream
[2:19:28] <Quinnman89> :(
[2:19:40] <Solidnick18> shit
[2:19:45] <Reizie_Etherealm> Hey man it's like when a pigeon decides to randomly shit on you ya know
[2:19:47] <%ChoculaUltra> you mean inhuman error?!
[2:19:53] <%The_Timo> Lol No given reason. I wish technical problems came with Given reasons lol
[2:19:55] <%25RPM> Sorry guys i hope you get it fixed!
[2:19:56] <+DaOsoMan> DaOsoMan subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:20:00] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> This is what happens when you trust technology
[2:20:03] <acedeone> exactly Reggie
[2:20:04] <derap41> Bad sectors on SD card are the worst because you can just have a couple mb of bad space and it completly fuckj the whole think
[2:20:10] <worldbrand> I had this happen recently where the problem was just dust, but it still took me like 20 minutes to figure that out
[2:20:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> TIMEFALL ATE YOUR SD CARD
[2:20:12] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Technology was a mistake
[2:20:16] <@Solidus_113> It's always nice to have the stream backup at times like this, so that's one good thing about streaming LPs
[2:20:19] <%DaOsoMan> wheres wollie?
[2:20:21] <VidulaSaix> Yep
[2:20:22] <derap41> an HDD can at least isolate and igore bad sectors
[2:20:27] <duskrush> Entertain us, Reggie
[2:20:35] <Reizie_Etherealm> We expected nothing and the SD card recorded even less
[2:20:37] <%DaOsoMan> thats reggie?
[2:20:39] <%DaOsoMan> huh
[2:20:45] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Dance Reggie
[2:20:48] <%ChoculaUltra> anywho - ya'll heard that Shounen Jump and Kubo Tite are announcing something at AnimeJapan2020 for Bleach's 20th anniversary? They got a website and animated short up and errthang. Thousand Year Blood War Arc animated?!
[2:20:55] <Frostydough1> But who will fill my BT shaped hole :/
[2:21:10] <duskrush> Tell us about French schools
[2:21:11] <+Mkingston> It's full of hentai
[2:21:12] <+BoBoGaijin> full of PORN
[2:21:12] <Prevot> big pornz
[2:21:15] <%wydamn> Make sure to rewind the tape before you start recording video again.
[2:21:16] <VidulaSaix> Horse Porn
[2:21:23] <Prevot> short haired tomboy hentai
[2:21:26] <+Taglog7> New deathnote
[2:21:41] <Solidnick18> lord daisuke PogChamp
[2:21:46] <@Solidus_113> that dash is WACK
[2:21:48] <VidulaSaix> Make absolutely sure there's nothing important on it before you delete it
[2:21:59] <+BoBoGaijin> its not as bad as it looks
[2:22:01] <Solidnick18> that air dash is like dah fuck
[2:22:16] <+BoBoGaijin> you can do different versions of the dash
[2:22:22] <NotHereToStream> you can cancel the IAD into an attack
[2:22:25] <+Javaa01> Yeah, you can cancel it into an attack way more suddenly
[2:22:30] <worldbrand> LUL
[2:22:30] <NotHereToStream> it cancels the momentum instantly
[2:22:34] <%LordSDB> Sounds stronger to me
[2:22:38] <%wydamn> space animals ruin everything
[2:22:41] <+Stupid121v2> "good."
[2:22:50] <+snarfton23> Reggie got shook
[2:23:10] <NotHereToStream> I don't know man, a giant magic circle is so noticable
[2:23:15] <@Solidus_113> I didn't notice any IAD's in the new footage either
[2:24:29] <VidulaSaix> Yteserdays session was over 5 hours though
[2:24:29] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:24:55] <@Solidus_113> Big story stuff is starting to happen too, you really don't want this footage to go bad
[2:24:55] <Naho_Saenoki> !MOTIVATED
[2:24:56] <@Moobot> 585 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[2:25:08] <peachy996> big sad
[2:25:09] <+Javaa01> Well, thankfully there's only two variables here
[2:25:13] <arkv01> USB ASMR Kreygasm
[2:25:25] <%wydamn> "This SD Card cannot be read. Error 375: SD Card is actually just a piece of cardboard."
[2:25:30] <Wowzerz2> Pat looks different
[2:25:31] <arkv01> but hey we got twitch vods, still gucci
[2:25:38] <NotHereToStream> take a break if you need to, don't force yourself
[2:26:02] <VidulaSaix> With stream vods nothing will ever be lost no matter how bad it goes
[2:26:08] <VidulaSaix> there's always at least that
[2:26:27] <acedeone> that sucks really bad Woolz sorry broh
[2:26:44] <peachy996> No More Heroes 2 LP was marred by it
[2:26:45] <Solidnick18> Things don't always go as planned
[2:26:56] <peachy996> Right at Alice Twilight too
[2:27:13] <DatAsuna> When I made that fake episode for the pazaak comp I lost 16 hours worth of editing near the end
[2:27:19] <+Mkingston> I see shit happen so much to streamers to blame the streamer. Shit happens.
[2:27:19] <DatAsuna> It was soul crushing lol
[2:27:24] <Reizie_Etherealm> Woolie you of all people should know that no one who's a part of this community expect anything more than nothing so feel free to deliver less
[2:27:26] <Solidnick18> The underwater audio oh jeez
[2:27:33] <acedeone> emulators must be such a pain in the ass for streaming
[2:27:43] <arkv01> take a break bros
[2:27:46] <VidulaSaix> You're not a fan of any of these chucklefucks if you haven't had to deal with underwater audio
[2:27:50] <VidulaSaix> On multiple occasions LUL
[2:28:04] <+Taglog7> back up the back up
[2:28:20] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Best Friends history has dealt with all the audio issue types
[2:28:36] <Solidnick18> Desynced audio is my biggest pev it really bothers me
[2:28:45] <VidulaSaix> Dync is worse than bad audio
[2:28:49] <VidulaSaix> Desync*
[2:29:11] <@Solidus_113> What was the LP that desync'd every time you went to the pause menu
[2:29:20] <+Mkingston> Last night's stream was desynced
[2:29:20] <VidulaSaix> I wanna say Evil Within 1?
[2:29:27] <bevyrage> it wasn't the pause menu, it was the save menu
[2:29:31] <VidulaSaix> Oh FFX
[2:29:32] <%ChoculaUltra> oh dear lord, Netflix just confirmed they're going to be the ones behind the Live Action One Piece. Is this the failed hero timeline?
[2:30:07] <+JacknZack27> I hope they take their inspiration from the 4kids dub
[2:30:14] <+snarfton23> Sounds good
[2:30:16] <pirateofpie> They were confirmed to be involved with that a while ago, I thought
[2:30:26] <XzileGaming> riveting gameplay
[2:30:26] <%LordSDB> At least Gintama had a good live action
[2:30:43] <VidulaSaix> I'd say take a glance up to the recording every 10-15 minutes to make sure its recording
[2:30:45] <%ChoculaUltra> confirmed as in like, it's actually good to go and start filming. Even had a note written by Oda to go along with the tweet.
[2:30:54] <pirateofpie> Oh
[2:30:54] <XzileGaming> entertain us reg
[2:31:04] <ALTRNico> yes
[2:31:04] <+Mkingston> Have you seen the trailers for Netflix's Ghost in the Shell 2045?
[2:31:09] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> DANCE
[2:31:12] <Solidnick18> yeye
[2:31:13] <+Taglog7> YEYEYE
[2:31:16] <%ChoculaUltra> and from the sound of the wording - it might be a show format instead of a movie/film
[2:31:19] <Solidnick18> LOL
[2:31:21] <VidulaSaix> Death Note Live Action was pretty good too. The Japanese ones
[2:31:23] <XzileGaming> too sexy for twitch
[2:31:24] <+BoBoGaijin> dance!
[2:31:24] <+Taglog7> Dance Stream Wen?
[2:31:25] <ALTRNico> no dance? :(
[2:31:26] <OldManDeckardCain> DEMON DEFEATED
[2:31:40] <+Stupid121v2> Explain boys
[2:31:41] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1222044563210145793?s=19
[2:31:52] <Reizie_Etherealm> Fucking thing sucks! Do it live!
[2:31:52] <duskrush> Do you know of the stuff that KH3's been implying or are you avoiding spoilers?
[2:31:52] <+Taglog7> Behind the Scenes
[2:31:59] <Solidnick18> Great
[2:32:05] <VidulaSaix> He doesnt play KH so no
[2:32:14] <+Stupid121v2> He has 0 interest probably lol
[2:32:24] <duskrush> He might be. There's some stuff
[2:32:24] <XzileGaming> Reggie stream mvp imo
[2:32:28] <+Stupid121v2> I fuckin love the implications
[2:32:32] <+Mkingston> Have you seen the trailers for Netflix's Ghost in the Shell 2045? What did you think?
[2:32:42] <duskrush> Something in particular I know he's interested in
[2:32:51] <%ChoculaUltra> that incomplete KH playthrough on the SBFP channel still hurts like a fresh wound :(
[2:32:57] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Heartmans the real villain
[2:33:00] <VidulaSaix> Ursula won
[2:33:21] <XzileGaming> ever since mega man 3 Hard Man has been studying the blade
[2:33:51] <+snarfton23> Yeah sucks KH was never finished
[2:34:00] <Mayachacha> we still in chapter 8?
[2:34:04] <duskrush> I feel like if Woolie knew he might be in
[2:34:15] <%The_Timo> PCCs for Zipline build on the way back, unless this is the final push
[2:34:17] <+Stupid121v2> Woolie playing KH2 is still the pipe dream I want
[2:34:18] <duskrush> Join the cult of Kingdom Hearts
[2:34:43] <VidulaSaix> Going through the KH3 Data fights and just thinking how much Woolie would love that hype shit
[2:34:50] <VidulaSaix> Shame the series itself is SUPER not his thing
[2:34:52] <Djinnazz> do you not rmember the last time they played KH???
[2:34:52] <duskrush> He really would
[2:34:55] <VidulaSaix> The gameplay in KH2 and KH3 is dope
[2:34:59] <+Stupid121v2> Its gameplay would appeal directly to him
[2:35:17] <duskrush> replace style switch with form change
[2:35:23] <duskrush> or drive
[2:35:26] <%ChoculaUltra> KH2 is still considered, in a lot of circles, a character action game
[2:35:34] <VidulaSaix> Yep
[2:35:37] <%ChoculaUltra> probably the tightest gameplay of the whole series.
[2:36:02] <arkv01> uh h stinky!
[2:36:04] <ALTRNico> good thing you have floating carrier
[2:36:06] <VidulaSaix> I know Liam's tried pushing it on both Woolie and Matt
[2:36:09] <VidulaSaix> To no avail LUL
[2:36:11] <%The_Timo> carrier time
[2:36:16] <Tucker0603> CARRIER
[2:36:25] <%supersugoisenpai1> It's a big order
[2:36:29] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> if youre lucky, you can find a truck midway and truck through it
[2:36:32] <duskrush> I know Liam tried pushing Chain of Memories
[2:36:39] <duskrush> but idk if he ever brought up KH2
[2:36:51] <VidulaSaix> He brought it up on camera to Matt more than once
[2:37:06] <arkv01> card game month origins
[2:37:12] <XzileGaming> JENGA
[2:37:15] <+Javaa01> You can honestly just get rid of the handguns at this point
[2:37:22] <Djinnazz> you're carrying way too many duplicates.
[2:37:25] <VidulaSaix> Carriers are king here
[2:37:35] <ALTRNico> no carrier? :(
[2:37:55] <duskrush> Kingdom Hearts will get Woolie one day

[2:38:02] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1222044563210145793?s=19
[2:38:03] <VidulaSaix> very seriously doubt it
[2:38:07] <+Stupid121v2> KH to outsiders looks fucking horrendous and stupid its so hard to convince people its kino
[2:38:19] <%ChoculaUltra> it really is
[2:38:21] <VidulaSaix> KH to fans is horrendous and stupid
[2:38:25] <VidulaSaix> But its charming in its stupidity
[2:38:29] <duskrush> When the hope of character action fails and he's hungry for something new
[2:38:30] <+Stupid121v2> thats fair tbh
[2:38:32] <%The_Timo> at the cost of being ill-prepared, he's going for speed. hm
[2:38:40] <TigerClaws12> spec ops later or?
[2:38:42] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[2:39:08] <XzileGaming> Woolie, take a block from the bottom and put it on top. then, after that, take a block from the middle and put it on top. respectively, thats how you build a tower, you just dont stop, taking blocks from the middle and put them all on top.
[2:39:09] <%ChoculaUltra> stupidly charming! Nomura could sneeze on a napkin and I'd be analyzing that shit for lore significance smh.
[2:39:16] <+Stupid121v2> terrorist bt's
[2:39:24] <arkv01> mmm norman goo-dus
[2:39:28] <duskrush> I don't think he needs that much protection this far in
[2:39:59] <duskrush> plus when you get where you need to go you probably don't want that much on you
[2:40:03] <+Stupid121v2> Once you get to your destination you wot have to worry much about gear.
[2:40:09] <VidulaSaix> Friendly reminder to glance up at the recording

[2:47:57] <DatAsuna> prosecco is the white girl starter pack
[2:48:08] <duskrush> Champagne. Champaign is when you play the story mode drunk

[2:58:57] <VidulaSaix> We're WAY past mountain knot Solidus
[2:59:08] <VidulaSaix> Oh you mean the pizza
[2:59:12] <duskrush> He had the delivery mission for the one before the tar belt
[2:59:15] <duskrush> but pizza first
[2:59:16] <masterfire23> so how does sam not age with the snow touching his face
[2:59:19] <@Solidus_113> remember the name of this safe hose

[2:59:54] <Nomad94> @masterfire23 ignore snow touching his face during gameplay; canonically his hood is always up when it needs to
[3:00:00] <VidulaSaix> SeemsGood
[3:00:03] <%sjay449> Fragile doesn’t bring the pizza with her
[3:00:30] <Nomad94> I can't wait for the Yeah Boyeee video to get to YT

[3:01:13] <@Solidus_113> the challenge is that it's far away
[3:01:17] <%sjay449> No lie. This game made me drink Monster
[3:01:28] <%The_Timo> Time for Trucking
[3:01:34] <ALTRNico> good thing you already built roads and ziplines
[3:01:40] <Nomad94> @Solidus_113 I read that as "tar away"
[3:01:44] <+Javaa01> No massive gimmicks on this one, just pack it on your back and grab a bike
[3:01:45] <Nomad94> also not inaccurate tho.
[3:01:52] <duskrush> like Norman Reedus?
[3:01:55] <VidulaSaix> Yeah just bike it
[3:02:01] <@Solidus_113> just make one
[3:02:02] <NotHereToStream> truck? pftt, you need to to ride with norman reedus
[3:02:03] <Cykron> Not for honor, but for pizza
[3:02:08] <@Solidus_113> RIDE
[3:02:10] <VidulaSaix> Lets RIDE
[3:02:16] <Solidnick18> RIDE
[3:02:20] <duskrush> with Norman Reedus
[3:02:21] <Nomad94> love it when the game makes you haul HUGE loads for miles that don't workk with ziplines.
[3:02:26] <Reizie_Etherealm> Way to go speed demon
[3:02:28] <Nomad94> *work
[3:02:34] <Solidnick18> catch a RIDE with norman reedus
[3:02:43] <%sjay449> I feel so fucking cool right now
[3:02:52] <duskrush> borderlands really messed up with not having that marketing
[3:03:09] <Nomad94> Still haven't had a can of Monster in my life
[3:03:15] <Nomad94> don't plan to
[3:03:29] <%sjay449> The basic flavour is terrible
[3:03:38] <Reizie_Etherealm> Now that's a lot of blood
[3:03:44] <%sjay449> The no sugar ones and the teas are pretty good
[3:03:46] <+TheDeadpoolDash> Standard Monster isn't great.
[3:03:47] <Cykron> @nomad94 It’s for the best
[3:04:17] <Meatbomb83> tried Moth
[3:04:24] <Meatbomb83> Mother
[3:04:28] <Cykron> THAT’S A LOTTA BAGS
[3:04:51] <DedlokPM> This bike is cool. It should be on AMC's Ride with Norman Reedus
[3:04:53] <Cykron> DO YOU WANT FRIES WITH THAT?
[3:05:01] <@Solidus_113> let us... Ride
[3:05:05] <peachy996> HE JUST LEFT

[3:05:26] <BlacSoul> kung pow the goat
[3:05:29] <FaytxStay> This is great.
[3:06:10] <VidulaSaix> Once you deliver this one you can just safehouse back to the geologist
[3:06:12] <worldbrand> but it's comfy. what a cozy stream
[3:06:14] <Nomad94> at least you have roads. I didn't build any.
[3:06:44] <peachy996> Imagine racing on those streets
[3:06:47] <yousayyugi> :3
[3:06:49] <%GeneralSCPatton> I can't believe he stops like that on every other turn. Does he not know how to do subtle angles on the stick?
[3:06:49] <Nomad94> Woolie's going for a Persona Postgame Party, eh?
[3:06:52] <@Solidus_113> teleporting back to where he left the main mission would be where to go

[3:07:51] <Nomad94> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli Reedus with Norman Rides
[3:08:00] <Cykron> Oh god
[3:08:01] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Dont underestimate the power of advertising
[3:08:02] <+linSP> this is the filler anime arc right before the season end
[3:08:15] <Nomad94> I guess we ain't getting to the tar belt today
[3:08:19] <peachy996> He's also Scud
[3:08:23] <peachy996> From Blade 2
[3:08:26] <RunningNGunning> Out of curiosity I checked to see what a Death Stranding speedrun looks like, that shit is hilarious
[3:08:27] <ALTRNico> rip Scud
[3:08:28] <Cykron> But the Pizza tho
[3:08:33] <@Solidus_113> Real gamers knew him from Walking Dead Survival Instincts
[3:08:47] <BlacSoul> He couldve been known as a Silent Hill Protag.... KONAMI
[3:08:48] <+TheDeadpoolDash> I remember him most from Boondock Saints
[3:08:51] <DedlokPM> @peachy996 Scud the Disposable Assassin?
[3:08:52] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Blade 2
[3:08:53] <Nomad94> @RunningNGunning Do they just haul ass all day, or is there actual strategy to it?
[3:08:55] <FaytxStay> ...Speed...Run?
[3:09:00] <VidulaSaix> Sam, I'm a little lost. Could you tell me how cool you feel right now?
[3:09:03] <Cykron> Norman Reedus is a swell guy and can really host a show
[3:09:07] <FaytxStay> This game has a speedrun category?
[3:09:08] <peachy996> Because Guillermo Del Toro directed Blade II

[3:09:21] <@Solidus_113> Norman is like 52 years old
[3:09:22] <Nomad94> I only know Boondock Saints from the Hellsing Abridged line

[3:09:54] <duskrush> Norman Reedus? From Ride with Norman Reedus?
[3:09:58] <Cykron> Motherfuckers always trying to floating carrier skate up hill
[3:10:05] <VidulaSaix> That happens to so many movies
[3:10:14] <FaytxStay> Sleeperhit?
[3:10:31] <RunningNGunning> @Nomad94 Lots of trip/fall running in the early bits, then using a glitch to basically fly using leaps, then once the vehicles get introduced a lot of driving.
[3:10:38] <RunningNGunning> I only skimmed it though

[3:26:12] <buffmurffy> hey just got here, why isn't woolie playing spec ops?
[3:26:26] <+Javaa01> Scheduling foibles

[3:26:51] <%supersugoisenpai1> you actually want a speed skeleton in a bit
[3:26:54] <buffmurffy> thanks guys
[3:27:56] <Cykron> All Terrian is good for most applications
[3:27:57] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1222044563210145793?s=19
[3:28:06] <@Solidus_113> Lvl 1 skeleton is a large package, Lvl 2 is a Med, Lvl 3 is a small
[3:28:27] <VidulaSaix> 3+ hours and we're finally doing actual story LUL
[3:28:39] <VidulaSaix> But you love it!
[3:28:45] <%DensityD> that's the same quote from 2018 and 2019 and 2020, "it took us a while"
[3:28:51] <duskrush> but wasn't it worth it?
[3:29:01] <duskrush> to see the look on that customer's face?
[3:29:19] <VidulaSaix> Except Peter
[3:29:24] <alrobot2014> even gourdman?

[3:30:32] <%Black_Machete> peter has a sharingan
[3:30:34] <+Javaa01> A couple of those dumb bridges in the mountains are placed by the devs
[3:30:34] <worldbrand> they had to come back and finish the bridges
[3:30:36] <+Aeoneth> My theory is that not all of your placed buildings are copied to the same shard
[3:30:47] <ALTRNico> there's an acheevo for lvl3ing every thing in the pcc
[3:30:48] <VidulaSaix> Not a theory, tahts fact
[3:31:08] <worldbrand> yeah you will very, very rarely see two structures by the same player if you're not strand buddies
[3:31:08] <%wydamn> trigger DA GHOSTS
[3:31:15] <+agumon9000> I bet that Motherfucker Peter doesn't EVEN EAT THE PIZZA. It's like ordering a pizza for delievery and not going to the door when the pizza boy arrives

[3:36:40] <@Solidus_113> you have enough guns honestly
[3:37:00] <+Javaa01> The grenade launcher only does lethal and blood tho, it's not effective against regular people
[3:37:16] <@Solidus_113> incorrect
[3:37:26] <ALTRNico> there's a sleeping nade
[3:37:26] <@Solidus_113> there's the slip and sleep grenades
[3:37:39] <+Javaa01> Oh huh
[3:38:01] <ALTRNico> rocket launcher might be the one you're thinking about
[3:38:04] <+linSP> some heavy guns have non lethal ammo

[3:40:44] <@Solidus_113> still need to equip a blood bag in the circle menu
[3:41:29] <VidulaSaix> Justice would be he dies without equipping it
[3:42:30] <@Solidus_113> american sniper over here

[3:42:56] <VidulaSaix> R1
[3:42:57] <Asuxley> he's approaching
[3:42:58] <jorniev> this is how actuall combat probably looks like
[3:43:00] <ALTRNico> BIG coward
[3:43:11] <jorniev> with more blood and screaming i mean
[3:43:15] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus still didn't equip a blood bag in the radial menu
[3:43:23] <+linSP> sam has never killed a person
[3:43:46] <+agumon9000> "This game doesn't have much combat. In fact, combat is often the bad option." ~ Kojima. >Can also load up on 3 rocket launchers, a grenade launcher, assault rifles, wearing plate armor, and throwing your piss at enemies.
[3:43:47] <Cykron> Yeah most actual combat involves engagements at max distance
[3:44:07] <@Solidus_113> Would you guess this isn't a Metal Gear game
[3:44:21] <%supersugoisenpai1> Who's footsteps are these?
[3:44:34] <Cykron> This is Afghanistan all over again
[3:44:49] <@Solidus_113> practice from Spec Ops
[3:44:52] <alrobot2014> if you gave the the carrier a d-dog costume i'd get really confused

[3:45:05] <VidulaSaix> He's about to die LUL
[3:45:13] <ALTRNico> I love how Woolie went back to make blood bags and not use it

[3:46:14] <Cykron> Woolie the bloodbags woolie
[3:46:26] <VidulaSaix> monkaS

[3:54:40] <@Solidus_113> Is Sam the Jesus
[3:54:42] <hectic_harlequin> Hey Woolz hope you're enjoying the game, always been a big fan.
[3:54:46] <Cykron> Could Reedus be Jesus? apatDab apatDab
[3:54:50] <VidulaSaix> I saw a double rainbow more than once in this game
[3:54:51] <hectic_harlequin> Anybody know if he's met Heartman yet?
[3:54:52] <+agumon9000> DOUBLE UPSIDEDOWN
[3:54:53] <VidulaSaix> Even a triple once
[3:54:53] <+Hinasil> Nothing like getting a twitch endless loopback where Woolie keeps saying, "And then we teleported back"
[3:54:54] <+agumon9000> RAINBOW
[3:55:05] <ALTRNico> Reedus Christ?
[3:55:08] <VidulaSaix> But Synder is boring. Kojima is fun LUL

[3:55:24] <+ConLin_Arts_> sbfpYeyeye I'm so stoked!
[3:55:24] <+Javaa01> Anyways, the lack of subtext WILL continue next
[3:55:31] <Graxe_> The Cross has joined the UCA
[3:55:34] <+Sebenoth> Kojima's messages are fun because he doesnt try to underplay it
[3:55:37] <BlacSoul> is it a 3rd?
[3:55:46] <+Sebenoth> its like "hey, symbolism, get it!?"
[3:55:47] <Cykron> So anyway I started fasting
[3:55:47] <peachy996> Yeah but Kojima has a silly sense of humor where Snyder doesn't understand humor
[3:55:53] <+drfaustisdead> oh good, this part.
[3:55:54] <alrobot2014> time to get the cross to 5 stars to have a sleep over

[5:32:37] <%LordSDB> The future is just full of NEETs Kappa
[5:32:37] <VidulaSaix> Being dragged off alive means you're alive when you explode into antimatter
[5:32:37] <+ALazo> Same thing
[5:32:40] <VidulaSaix> Doesnt sound pleasant
[5:32:42] <Laecerelius> No, he would create a BT if his body isn't properly disposed of. A BT has to eat a person to create a voidout
[5:32:46] <redrins> dead=bt, alive=void out
[5:32:48] <%The_Timo> being aged to death slowly lol
[5:32:51] <@Solidus_113> the pain of being consumed by a BT
[5:32:58] <+Javaa01> Nah Woolie, that just makes a regular BT
[5:33:01] <duskrush> Dying doesn't cause a voidout. When a BT (the big ones) eat you it causes a voidout. He was trying to kill himself because if he's dead when it eats him it won't cause a voidout
[5:33:08] <duskrush> Dying just makes more BT's, and therefore more voidout
[5:33:15] <Pappajimbo> the ida i think is ithe dead arnt eatan by bts so it would have dropped him
[5:33:16] <NotHereToStream> well remember he killed someone out of mercy while being dragged?
[5:33:23] <zenith0111> ???
[5:33:24] <+JacknZack27> Dead would eventually make a bt, but alive is a void out
[5:33:30] <NotHereToStream> so he hoped killing himself will stop that
[5:33:43] <Djinnazz> You void out, you cease to exsist, no afterlife, no nothing.
[5:33:59] <Solidnick18> the timefall
[5:34:28] <zenith0111> It's a common question that I'm honestly surprised viewers/players couldn't piece together
[5:34:52] <@Solidus_113> Space Force is useless in Stranding world
[5:34:56] <VidulaSaix> I'm pretty sure it doesn't matter if you're alive of dead. Voidouts are caused by the antimatter coming into contact

[5:37:04] <@Solidus_113> JO Crystals?
[5:37:08] <Hammatime8> But is there WOOLOO?
[5:37:12] <%DensityD> goop
[5:37:20] <Solidnick18> woo woo woo you know it
[5:37:22] <DatAsuna> It isn't, this person is just saying it is
[5:37:23] <%supersugoisenpai1> Japanese are obsessed with stars and blood types
[5:37:25] <Graxe_> They told you that in the beginning of the game
[5:37:25] <Laecerelius> Healing crystals are just small amounts of chirilium sending your body back in time to when it was healthy
[5:37:32] <VidulaSaix> Woolie, you're sounding a lot like Pat right now LUL
[5:37:34] <+eanscrale> Same man, same
[5:37:36] <Graxe_> When you entered your birthday
[5:37:46] <Cykron> Let’s sit in a circlejerk and power up these Chiral Crystals
[5:37:48] <Pappajimbo> well chriliam crystals will have an effect. they will kill you
[5:37:55] <%LordSDB> this is great
[5:37:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> JO crystals get the biggest charge from chokejerking
[5:37:58] <zenith0111> @woolieversus It's not the stereotypical constellations he uses the real ones that people don't talk about.
[5:38:04] <%DensityD> that's a strong effect
[5:38:22] <%GeneralSCPatton> Double charge if there's a G O U R D involved
[5:38:23] <VidulaSaix> A bad world view LUL
[5:38:24] <peachy996> You should give that shit the time of day
[5:38:24] <Prevot> LUL
[5:38:29] <peachy996> It's important
[5:38:32] <%DensityD> I like the constellations from Night in the WOods
[5:38:35] <Hammatime8> Motorcycles :)
[5:38:40] <%LordSDB> Woolie has the greatest scam ever, the zodiac.
[5:38:45] <%LordSDB> hates
[5:38:50] <VidulaSaix> BOI
[5:38:56] <+ALazo> Close your heart to it
[5:38:58] <%DensityD> need timestop
[5:39:01] <Pappajimbo> kratos vs the bt gods
[5:39:01] <Hammatime8> OY.

[5:39:31] <peachy996> A whole lotta woo
[5:39:35] <Cykron> I love being a Virgo apatGoblin
[5:39:47] <zenith0111> I don't know why you're searching for scientific answers to something like coming BACK TO LIFE
[5:40:00] <%LordSDB> im a Aquarius and year of the roostet
[5:40:12] <%supersugoisenpai1> Why does that guy in Metal Gear shoot bees?
[5:40:13] <Hammatime8> The reading has been defeated! :D
[5:40:17] <@Solidus_113> Next session is going to be EVEN LONGER
[5:40:22] <%DensityD> BIG YAWN
[5:40:23] <Solidnick18> Well you are almost done tho
[5:40:23] <VidulaSaix> Alright, so next session you have two options. Either a fairly short stream going over a few chapters that'll be about 2 hours, or you guys will need to settle in for a really long stream of about 7-8 hours, cause once the end game starts there's absolutely no room for a break. That being said you fuys will definitely finish this game next week @WoolieVersus
[5:40:24] <Prevot> @lordsdb same here, I think
[5:40:27] <zenith0111> @supersugoisenpai1 I need to know!
[5:40:34] <%Irridium> yeah you gonna be in for a LOT next session
[5:40:35] <Solidnick18> next should be the big final
[5:40:38] <Hammatime8> We never have to read again! yay book dum do vidyo gaem!
[5:40:41] <Pappajimbo> metal gear does have a lot of bullshit in it
[5:40:42] <NotHereToStream> you will finish it soon, bring popcorns for the next stream
[5:40:45] <NotHereToStream> trusssst me
[5:41:00] <Cykron> He’s not entirely wrong
[5:41:09] <Djinnazz> it's not 7 hours
[5:41:12] <duskrush> yep
[5:41:20] <Laecerelius> It's pretty long
[5:41:22] <@Solidus_113> there's a lot of cutscenes
[5:41:22] <Djinnazz> 5 at the most
[5:41:23] <%LordSDB> @prevot. Brother woolieCHAN
[5:41:24] <VidulaSaix> No, either a 2 hour stream followed by a 6 hours stream next time
[5:41:26] <VidulaSaix> Or 7-8 total
[5:41:29] <@Solidus_113> like a whole fucking movie
[5:41:29] <VidulaSaix> Yeah woolie has it
[5:41:30] <Cykron> It’s magic, I’m not gonna explain shit
[5:41:31] <Solidnick18> the cutscenes are very long
[5:41:39] <Solidnick18> it's a fat movie
[5:41:50] <VidulaSaix> 2 plus cleanup sounds good
[5:42:00] <%spiritofmojave> it's not usual Kojima beef cutscene length, but it's up there
[5:42:02] <zenith0111> No real "clean up" unless you mean 5 star everyone LUL
[5:42:02] <@Solidus_113> that's right
[5:42:07] <%DensityD> have you heard that Kojima productions is thinking of publishing films? Kappa
[5:42:17] <Solidnick18> lol
[5:42:19] <NotHereToStream> kojima wants to make manga and anime too
[5:42:21] <VidulaSaix> The pizza payoff will be worth it dont worry LUL
[5:42:22] <Hammatime8> PIZZA PogChamp
[5:42:23] <Djinnazz> you don't need to worry about clean up
[5:42:25] <arkv01> PIZZA BOYS NAAAU
[5:42:25] <+MrRabbles> pizza time
[5:42:26] <Solidnick18> He needs that pizza
[5:42:27] <%spiritofmojave> PIZZA CONTINUITY
[5:42:32] <%DensityD> woohoo pizza man
[5:42:33] <%Irridium> you wanna deliver that pizza
[5:42:35] <@Solidus_113> The last pizza will come at chapter 10, and you can do it during the story section
[5:42:39] <VidulaSaix> Yep
[5:42:44] <%DensityD> gay cowboy that doesn't smoke or swear
[5:42:46] <+jiggy_snipe> pizza should be done on stream
[5:42:49] <%LordSDB> Will Woolie finally get his tip?
[5:42:52] <VidulaSaix> You're more or less done for off stream activities already
[5:42:55] <VidulaSaix> Just a few cleanup
[5:42:58] <zenith0111> First Prepper!!!!
[5:42:58] <%supersugoisenpai1> Next pizza is the payoff
[5:43:36] <NotHereToStream> vet prepper
[5:43:43] <%Irridium> veteran you gotta wait for an email before you can bring him in
[5:43:44] <Reizie_Etherealm> Sounds good
[5:43:45] <@Solidus_113> The end of Death Stranding is like the beginning of Automata Route C. It just fucking goes and doesn't stop
[5:43:54] <VidulaSaix> Yep
[5:44:01] <%DensityD> at the end of the day, it's video games
[5:44:06] <NotHereToStream> at the end of the day, sign this please
[5:44:12] <duskrush> quick thing: Dying makes BTs. Getting eaten by BTs does voidouts
[5:44:18] <VidulaSaix> Doing things off stream really helped expediate the process
[5:44:18] <+Javaa01> One for each chapter
[5:44:18] <%Irridium> at the end of the day, choke jerkman
[5:44:38] <NotHereToStream> bruh, as long as you enjoying it
[5:44:54] <VidulaSaix> He seems to be since he 5 starred damn near everyone
[5:45:00] <Solidnick18> yep
[5:45:03] <peachy996> We got some fun stream moments on sidemissions
[5:45:06] <zenith0111> Mainline explains everything you need to know. Everything else is more or less flavor text
[5:45:11] <zayasu> you do?
[5:45:12] <Solidnick18> gonna find out
[5:45:28] <%The_Timo> I was very disappointed by the ending but I'm interested to see watya think
[5:45:36] <+jiggy_snipe> avoid him
[5:45:40] <peachy996> Jerk Chokeman
[5:45:40] <Prevot> monkaS
[5:45:40] <Djinnazz> is he aware of E-mail??
[5:45:48] <VidulaSaix> I'm keen to see how Woolie will react to the thing Pat claims is the "worst thing ever"
[5:45:49] <Solidnick18> yep
[5:45:51] <+Javaa01> Not voiced by him though
[5:45:58] <Reizie_Etherealm> Joke Cherkman
[5:46:05] <VidulaSaix> HE IS
[5:46:06] <Solidnick18> the voice is liam o brian
[5:46:07] <zenith0111> Pat didn't understand the motivations of the.... *spoiler*
[5:46:07] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:46:07] <+Razputin217> Sam, do the face!

[5:46:25] <peachy996> All for Knot?!
[5:46:29] <+jiggy_snipe> you will see
[5:46:29] <Cykron> Which celebrity should do the mo cap on Choke Jerkman?
[5:46:30] <Graxe_> It's robots
[5:46:30] <%Lion_kun> it is not anti-climactic
[5:46:31] <%GeneralSCPatton> You'll see
[5:46:35] <Graxe_> It has to be robots
[5:46:38] <%The_Timo> nope
[5:46:39] <@Solidus_113> don't think about it
[5:46:48] <NotHereToStream> its choke jerkman, sorry I had to say it
[5:46:49] <VidulaSaix> He delivers the final pizza and it's Woolie himself in the game
[5:46:58] <Hammatime8> Papa John himself rises from the grave and brings forth a great reckoning Kappa
[5:46:59] <%Lion_kun> Woolie, I promise, it's not anti climactic
[5:47:03] <+jiggy_snipe> big cameo - Papa John
[5:47:08] <+Razputin217> its super worth it
[5:47:10] <@Solidus_113> IT'S PAPA JOHN
[5:47:11] <zenith0111> Pretty tame in terms of twists
[5:47:15] <peachy996> I promise you will get something out of it

[5:47:33] <NZolozabal> @WoolieVersus No, but don't think about it though.
[5:47:35] <%Irridium> it's a good one.

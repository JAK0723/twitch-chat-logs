[0:01:48] <%kekkerscrew> Th3SmartAlec You'd think that. But then just as the Squall arrives. Gutz will sacrifice himself to send Reggie on his way

[0:02:10] <%MrRabbles> actually it might not be it might be a mashup
[0:02:12] <Leonheart777> The Give up arc Continues
[0:02:12] <%Amaideus> It's a mashup of a JSR song and Metatron's theme
[0:02:16] <Leonavius> woolie's the winner in my heart
[0:02:20] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Diana869 Maybe final, maybe 4 more
[0:02:22] <Leonavius> the most valorous
[0:02:22] <%Amaideus> Oh, apparently Hotland in general
[0:02:23] <%optimasmaximas> @Diana869 monkaS *ptsd ensues*

[0:02:31] <Martianorbit> #PrayForReggie
[0:02:36] <%Amaideus> I don't remember which songs exactly though
[0:02:43] <AppleBoi85> Get'em minh!
[0:02:43] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:02:44] <+Vancoolness> damn.. this is some garbage music
[0:02:45] <%Th3SmartAlec> @kekkerscrew Not if Reggie has anything to say about it Kappa
[0:02:46] <BackwardCap> First time reading the Manga now that the Anime has caught up. Lets go doodMaxhype
[0:02:54] <Leonavius> it's metaton's first theme plus jsrf
[0:02:54] <%Amaideus> This one's definitely the Core theme from Undertale though
[0:02:56] <%2hutown> Woolie must've needed to set up the metal detector before things begin. Can't have anyone playin dirty on this most auspicious day
[0:02:59] <DXLelouch24> Make the hailmary Darkling play Woolie or more than likely Minh will win, its time to play dirty to stop him
[0:03:00] <SinisterBiscuits> Woolie drags the bloody stumps that were his legs through hell while two real estate agents fight a drug war.
[0:03:02] <gigiaten> Reggie is gonna win and that's facts
[0:03:10] <gunstar73> Unless Reggie gets lucky it’s over 4 the shield hero
[0:03:11] <%Th3SmartAlec> @2hutown But... he's the one with the knives?
[0:03:13] <%JustYudha> Whoa what was that art
[0:03:27] <%StaceMcGate> I demand at least 5 mins of EVO hype from Woolie!
[0:03:29] <BlacSoul> JSRF Remixes? Todays a good day
[0:03:30] <%Th3SmartAlec> Dope Kirby art LUL
[0:03:36] <KeroKamina> the music timign with the zoom in was pretty godlike
[0:03:37] <Martianorbit> Shinya Kumazaki
[0:03:49] <%kekkerscrew> gunstar73 Reggie getting lucky? Like that will ever happen?
[0:03:52] <%2hutown> @Th3SmartAlec Its fine if he keeps the knives
[0:03:59] <%Amaideus> It's Fly Like a Mettaton by Botanic Sage I think
[0:04:01] <%jiggy_snipe> so Mr. Wizard isn't a crazy person but man I wanted a shitshow
[0:04:14] <%Reverend_Roscoe> SALT AND BLOOD
[0:04:15] <gunstar73> Kinda want Reggie to win just cuz how salty it would make the other 2
[0:04:20] <evilaltruistic> let's. FUCKING GOOOOOOO!

[0:04:30] <redstrawherring> @stacemcgate followed by a pop off report news
[0:04:37] <evilaltruistic> Any chance for this one to be THE ONE?
[0:04:42] <BackwardCap> The Skullgirls launch party never ends sajamSegue3 sajamSegue4
[0:04:43] <%krispen_wa> reggie losing because he decided to rob that shop would be the ultimate character arc
[0:04:44] <%jiggy_snipe> Team Reggie I still believe woolieREGGIEFUL woolieTRASH
[0:04:45] <%SuperKirby24> so whod'a thunk evo themselves would be the ones styling on the delay based games by including 4 more rollback games LUL
[0:04:47] <+McGwinnicus> Let there be BLOOOOOOD
[0:04:51] <lazerscraper> HOES MAD
[0:05:02] <nepwar> lets see if today will be the day that someone wear the crown of blood
[0:05:11] <+RagnarokAdvent> blood feud the game
[0:05:12] <BurningSaph> July is now EVO month that part is pretty wild
[0:05:25] <evilaltruistic> I'm scared and eager, like it's my first time.
[0:05:32] <%C4m3r0n0409> Minh is gonna win from endgame bonuses
[0:05:34] <+soundcloud_raptor> we in there
[0:05:37] <thesickestzak> Can't believe Reggie ruined his character last time stealing from the store. Now he can never ever be fixed.
[0:05:37] <Martianorbit> So apparently someone wrote a university thesis on Naruto Hentai.
[0:05:39] <Ner234> I've missed some many Dokapon streams and I haven't had the time to catch up on Youtube. How lost will I be?
[0:05:44] <%C4m3r0n0409> killed most monsters saved most towns
[0:05:46] <+Velloriaa> can anyone remember roughly what ep woolie turned alchemist?
[0:05:49] <jubejube56> How many times will Woolie have to give up this session before he finally gets his full heal?
[0:05:51] <%optimasmaximas> @Martianorbit no way
[0:05:53] <%Amaideus> @Martianorbit PM me the link pls
[0:05:58] <hawmaro95> Let's go Minh!! Drugs FTW!
[0:06:04] <nepwar> what song is this?
[0:06:05] <%RioGascar> We know how this shall end
[0:06:05] <gunstar73> If Minh doesn’t win I’ll be surprised but it’s domapon so who knows
[0:06:06] <%StrifeZubia> @Martianorbit Gonna need some sauce to go with this pasta bud
[0:06:08] <%RioGascar> in blood

[0:06:11] <%Amaideus> 2 sessions ago I think @Velloriaa
[0:06:17] <gigiaten> @thesickestzak I see what you did there LUL
[0:06:20] <Mattxii> come on woolie!
[0:06:20] <%optimasmaximas> @Martianorbit is this new/recent news? or from some odd years ago? cause id love to read the article about it LUL
[0:06:24] <evilaltruistic> Will Sasuke Woolie be pardoned of his crimes and hit that pink haired booty?
[0:06:25] <+Velloriaa> thanks @Amaideus !
[0:06:30] <thesickestzak> @gigiaten :)
[0:06:34] <%Amaideus> Was either 2 or 3
[0:06:46] <%2hutown> Evo including more rollback games only make sense. Can you imagine how much shit they would get if it was disaster. Offical Evo tourney or not, their name is attached to it all
[0:06:49] <Martianorbit> It was a google doc, unfortunately I can't search in quarantine.
[0:06:53] <%optimasmaximas> @evilaltruistic well sasuke showed up to pat's stream last night so i suppose he was free to wander about
[0:07:04] <Martianorbit> Someone on /h/ posted it I think.
[0:07:27] <%DaBigVitus> This is the Danielson/Styles/Joe triple threat match of our time
[0:07:28] <%jiggy_snipe> yea you can't mess up the EVO brand like that by having a open online tourney with bad netcode games
[0:07:30] <BurningSaph> Animevo online better be nothing but Melty
[0:07:35] <%iamwood99> it’s been truly a journey
[0:07:45] <%optimasmaximas> @Martianorbit is that a subreddit? cant ell if that's what the slashes were for sorry
[0:07:46] <Martianorbit> @optimasmaximas think it was within the year
[0:07:49] <Mr_Ease> here we go, I'm super hyped for this

[0:09:07] <%jiggy_snipe> oh Smash would have been horrible with that netcode and all the wifi-warriors
[0:09:15] <%soFISHticated98> #minhwillwin
[0:09:18] <jubejube56> @mr_ease I think that is largely thanks to how many online tournies for smash ultimate there have already been. Seen first hand how bad the experience can get
[0:09:21] <%CaptainPileDriver> smash died for good netcode
[0:09:29] <%2hutown> I didnt see it in the catalogue, does /h/ have a archive like desu?
[0:09:31] <ExileNineteen> @DaBigVitus with a better start woolie could easily finish this session. question is whether he wants to
[0:09:35] <%RioGascar> Wonder if next evo will have games with rollback
[0:09:35] <ChouGokuOozaru> what song was that?
[0:09:36] <thesickestzak> ▲ ▲ ▲ :(
[0:09:43] <%optimasmaximas> @Martianorbit ill be sure to open it and have the sound on when i go in for the interview agter i sumbit my application today

[0:11:59] <%elbigante> i wonder if woolie's seen the melty blood version of "somebody's getting fucked" cause that also feels like a theme of dokapon

[0:46:27] <%Fujiwara_92> PLOT ARMOR TOO STRONK
[0:46:27] <andrei11dr> I feel like Reggie keeps bouncing between terrible luck and amazing luck
[0:46:28] <Shishi1205> Easy
[0:46:29] <%Amaideus> And it bounced 2 or 3 spells back at Minh when he tried it on Reggie
[0:46:30] <Sirmickle> Reggie's ability has let him sit and do nothing while Mihn takes over the world around him
[0:46:39] <%SuperKirby24> Ded
[0:46:39] <%MyNameIsRasus> ggez
[0:46:40] <+magiclottie> COME ONflare lance
[0:46:40] <Junkles> Chi Knuckle I think
[0:46:42] <+magiclottie> damn
[0:46:43] <ExileNineteen> @Wrashis no, this weapon has a chance to buff all of his stats when he attacks
[0:46:43] <%DaBigVitus> pazuzu had a bomb in it's vag
[0:46:44] <%C4m3r0n0409> WOOOW
[0:46:45] <Leonavius> GIRL POWER
[0:46:45] <+Invlux> that poison is gonna fuck woolie over here eventually
[0:46:48] <%krispen_wa> GETTING HUGE
[0:46:48] <supercjk333> can we all get dokopon for the console rerelease
[0:46:49] <+Wrashis> i see
[0:46:50] <Leonavius> wait
[0:46:51] <%Solidnick18> nno
[0:46:53] <Leonavius> that skill
[0:46:53] <%MyNameIsRasus> Not worth
[0:46:53] <sonofthedeepsouth> STACKS
[0:46:54] <WizardofWazz> no
[0:46:54] <andrei11dr> And Pazuzu is dead
[0:46:55] <+Rekinsinn> @Wrashis that was chi knuckle?
[0:46:55] <BurningSaph> Powering up
[0:46:57] <Sangled> PogChamp
[0:46:59] <%2hutown> Gettin beefy down in HECK
[0:46:59] <gunstar73> No it was chi knuckle that did random move
[0:47:00] <%Grayhammatter> getting big huge
[0:47:05] <+Wrashis> yeah it was probably chi knuckle.
[0:47:06] <Leonavius> makes battles potentially really easy to predict right
[0:47:08] <%Ipsenscastle> Can't fault Woolie for persevering in heck, it seems to be paying off finally
[0:47:10] <%StrifeZubia> @supercjk333 I would kill for modern dokapon with online play
[0:47:11] <%jiggy_snipe> Reggie go to Africa if you can
[0:47:13] <+BizarreRevolver> woolie really needs to pull his devil trigger to win
[0:47:13] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> unerground?
[0:47:13] <Shishi1205> no?
[0:47:14] <%MyNameIsRasus> jk... unless?
[0:47:14] <%CursedNobleman> who has the best position?
[0:47:15] <%Amaideus> Wasn't it a cursed chi knuckle though
[0:47:16] <Decimated_body> Unless?
[0:47:16] <%legacy0117> Reggie has plot armor, but Woolie is playing with the clock, and Minh has a full deck at his disposal.
[0:47:17] <%KosOrSomeSayKosm_> so thanks to hell woolz is the highest level player now
[0:47:17] <%Grayhammatter> you can go to africa minh
[0:47:19] <%DaBigVitus> I think we need an unless emote

[0:48:03] <BackwardCap> 1% chance is too risky LUL
[0:48:05] <nepwar> this would be an opportune time for reggie to take those towns from minh if he loses his debt

[0:55:53] <Mr_Ease> equipment isn't in item spaces
[0:55:55] <%C4m3r0n0409> HOW BOUT A SHIELD
[0:55:56] <Shishi1205> Tiamat is your best chance at a shield
[0:55:56] <%legacy0117> At least Woolie can still hit decently hard.
[0:56:00] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @nobody12349
[0:56:03] <sonofthedeepsouth> Lockdown PogChamp
[0:56:04] <%jiggy_snipe> Alchemy is so busted

[0:56:19] <%Fujiwara_92> LOCKDOWN WILL LAST LONGER SAYS MJNH
[0:56:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> @jiggy_snipe There is literally a counter, it's called Spellsword.
[0:56:25] <nobody12349> Woolie losing his shield was Rock Lee dropping the weights.
[0:56:25] <Shishi1205> The counter to alchemy is killing the alchemist
[0:56:25] <+Invlux> decent replacements for sleep
[0:56:26] <ExileNineteen> @jiggy_snipe the counter is to birddog him and stab him a lot
[0:56:33] <Mattxii> this is where woolie gets the 2nd wind to achieve the anime comeback
[0:56:34] <+fgcmorad> Get curse
[0:56:35] <+McGwinnicus> Thank mew

[0:56:44] <sonofthedeepsouth> Purr-furr
[0:56:47] <ExileNineteen> most alchemist builds can't stand up in endgame pvp fights
[0:56:50] <BiscoitoCaboloso> Woolie is becoming the Doomslayer
[0:56:51] <%Amaideus> The counter to alche is beating the shit out of him and stealing his cash
[0:56:51] <+IwuzPh34rless> tiamat has a 5% chance to drop a shield
[0:56:53] <%SuperKirby24> Thank mew
[0:56:53] <Zayasu> THANK MEW
[0:56:54] <%legacy0117> There is, it's called Spellsword relentlessly chasing the Alchemist and murdering him over and over agsin.

[1:23:18] <+aishman> Wait guys why did Woolie become a darkling when it was deep in HECK
[1:23:22] <+NWannabe> Minh really trying to be nice to woolie
[1:23:24] <zocano> Come here Minh and never stop come here
[1:23:24] <%Grayhammatter> take all minh's towns
[1:23:25] <+projectmanatees> HE must not win
[1:23:25] <Mr_Ease> heres the thing... If Woolie global dominations, he shoots to first place because he has all the castles
[1:23:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> Listen to this motherfucker talk.
[1:23:26] <+Zenryoku21> Let's get some Reggie rolls soulki4Geoo
[1:23:26] <%legacy0117> Also, he has literally extended this game by another session possibly.
[1:23:28] <+Invlux> Minh is nervous so he's monologueing LUL
[1:23:28] <supercjk333> take all of mihns towns first woolie
[1:23:29] <Shishi1205> Time to conquer africa
[1:23:31] <glass_marcus> A true villian always explains his plans
[1:23:34] <Junkles> Tales of Minh
[1:23:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> Minh's doing a LOT of talking right now.
[1:23:40] <%DaBigVitus> if not tonight it ends this weekend
[1:23:40] <%jiggy_snipe> the game isn't gonna end for awhile
[1:23:45] <SinisterBiscuits> Nothing can stop him going back and banking his dark art points to smoke everyone's towns before he goes for the overlord, I assume.
[1:23:46] <%Amaideus> @aishman Woolie wants to reset the board because he's down by a LOT
[1:23:47] <%nintega010> woolie will go to australia and take all his town back
[1:23:48] <BiscoitoCaboloso> Minh is black Zetsu
[1:23:50] <%jiggy_snipe> why would you end while in 3rd place
[1:23:51] <mdkcde> When the tongue loosens, the desperation shows
[1:23:51] <%Fujiwara_92> MINH SCURRED
[1:23:51] <+NWannabe> What happened to silent Minh, not ruled by emotions
[1:23:54] <+Dimfish> if woolie resets all towns, minh gets his passport free and then retakes his own towns
[1:23:54] <%C4m3r0n0409> AFRICA
[1:23:54] <%MrRabbles> global assault is the only way to destroy minh
[1:23:56] <%chickenhunter> there arent enough towns left for woolie to win just by beating the final boss. Minh has too many of them
[1:23:57] <Namillus> @Shishi1205 Don't you mean "Time to conquer all of In-di-aaaaaaa - most of In-di-aaaaaa"
[1:23:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> Minh is SO scurred
[1:23:58] <%2hutown> Guess this wont be the final. probably
[1:23:59] <+aishman> @Amaideus Ah fair.

[1:24:07] <supercjk333> Mihn your plans are to confusing for woolie and reggie to understand
[1:24:07] <%0rond> DOKAPON WILLS IT
[1:24:07] <%Diana869> not if he roles 5 the whole way
[1:24:09] <+magiclottie> can the darkling enter Hell?
[1:24:09] <%Amaideus> @legacy0117 4055
[1:24:09] <%GrassCannon> Woolie's the only one who can fight Overlord Rico. He doesn't have to grab that snitch until he's in a position to win.
[1:24:09] <thesickestzak> When darkness turns to light, it ends tonight, it ends tonight
[1:24:10] <JetpackMcQuack> Woolie came to play
[1:24:13] <%Daba_mk2> killing minh is the way to victory
[1:24:14] <+IwuzPh34rless> Ill cartographo would be hilarious
[1:24:14] <%nintega010> Steal Australia back
[1:24:15] <%Grayhammatter> woolie needs to take minh's towns
[1:24:16] <%alpacasintophats> RETAKE THE BLOOD OF THE AUSSIES
[1:24:16] <vaderxyz1970> OVER 4K
[1:24:17] <haitakaa> Minh fears the darkness of woolies pocket hole
[1:24:22] <%legacy0117> My GOD.
[1:24:22] <%Ipsenscastle> Reggie is keenly aware Woolie is beelining to flatten him
[1:24:27] <%jiggy_snipe> @GrassCannon exactly
[1:24:31] <FullmetalKaito> Can anyone please tell me how long the Dokapon streams usually go for?
[1:24:37] <supercjk333> take back Grenada from mihn woolie
[1:24:38] <ExileNineteen> ~5 hours
[1:24:39] <%Amaideus> 5ish hours @FullmetalKaito

[1:24:41] <Robot_Nixon_> let jebus take the wheel BlessRNG

[1:24:45] <+Movemeister> psychokinesis would've been nuts
[1:24:46] <%nintega010> @Ipsenscastle nah woolie is going straight for minh
[1:24:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> @ipsenscastle If he does that instead of doing after Minh, that would be the dumbest play he's ever done.
[1:24:52] <%MrRabbles> purse cutter is worthless when everyone is broke
[1:24:52] <%Ashenik1> so its not Woolie to blame for his ation but the universe, got ya
[1:24:56] <BurdRightsActivist> cutters useless

[1:25:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh, free towns.
[1:25:11] <zocano> He has to go after Minh and never stop going after Minh
[1:25:14] <supercjk333> taking towns is the only darkling way
[1:25:14] <Maleicus> need to cutter all those items
[1:25:16] <%Picia000123> take them towns

[1:25:44] <HologramInteractive> some of you joiks made minh paranoid gj
[1:25:44] <golfclubabby> Woolie somehow only hurts Reggie in darkling and then Minh coasts to victory
[1:25:46] <Shishi1205> Makuta was woolies
[1:25:47] <notgarza> He gas a second phone Kappa
[1:25:52] <%nintega010> @CommanderCobra1994 Global domination is the perfect move

[1:25:55] <supercjk333> Woolie take them towns. Reggie get those doggoa
[1:25:56] <Maleicus> reggie should go to heck since woolie may take everything again, just so he has a passport

[1:28:03] <%Solidnick18> ok woolie
[1:28:04] <%KosOrSomeSayKosm_> if darkling takes the towns, which is highly likely, this won't be the last sesh
[1:28:09] <%nintega010> @NWannabe trying to take away minhs towns
[1:28:09] <%DaBigVitus> only dokapon can judge me
[1:28:10] <%Grayhammatter> you robbed them minh
[1:28:11] <%Ipsenscastle> Minh's field warp basically makes him Darkling proof
[1:28:13] <%C4m3r0n0409> You don't need global
[1:28:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> Go to Australia and take away Isa.
[1:28:14] <%Superdandy96> Yeah, okay Woolz
[1:28:25] <+NWannabe> Ah....
[1:28:27] <f4ntom98> If Woolie causes Global whatever I think he'll be on top because of his castles
[1:28:32] <%jiggy_snipe> this wasn't gonna be last because Woolie wasn't gonna fight Rico and I don't Minh or Reggie can even try

[1:30:26] <%Grayhammatter> he's worrying about reggie, while minh still has towns
[1:30:33] <%legacy0117> So, yeah, this game us literally just fighting game RPG PVP/PVE.
[1:30:37] <NyxFang> Go after Mihn
[1:30:38] <zocano> He can’t hit Minh atm

[1:31:04] <Sirmickle> any bets on how long it'll be before someone feels confident enough to enter Heck again?
[1:31:06] <%C4m3r0n0409> Woolie doesn't have a plan

[1:31:31] <supercjk333> well done mihn
[1:31:36] <%Ipsenscastle> @andrei11dr how? He's been fucked over more than enough
[1:31:39] <%MrRabbles> Dokapon will decide the number of streams
[1:31:39] <+greatmonorail> I made comments about it before but Woolies' "plans" are unthought out and luck-based. It's really just desperation tactics but the villain is telling you its a plan.
[1:31:40] <zocano> Honestly going to South America isn’t a bad play for Woolie
[1:31:41] <lessthanhuman_tv> @sirmickle I think Woolie might do it right away after he's impoverished post-Darkling
[1:31:48] <%Daba_mk2> Coward
[1:31:50] <+McGwinnicus> locked himself in the tower
[1:32:00] <jubejube56> I feel like Minh should at least try Climbing the tower to get good gear
[1:32:01] <Electro96> alchemist is so op
[1:32:04] <SinisterBiscuits> Minh emulating the Rapunzel stratagem.
[1:32:06] <FloresIsDead> Mihn is so afraid omg

[1:32:09] <%Nekros4442> Was Alchemist the hero class all along?
[1:32:14] <%legacy0117> He is rolling low currently, I think he used up his style points and his Devil Trigger is not working well.

[1:35:22] <%jiggy_snipe> Woolie is gonna go put down Minh
[1:35:23] <lotharrio> @ExileNineteen Except it will be 2 days, and he won't be spinning for points, then.
[1:35:24] <supercjk333> bout time woolie
[1:35:27] <%Ipsenscastle> @CommanderSqueaks looks like you called it, i genuinely thought he was out for Reggie blood
[1:35:28] <Sangled> nice woolie
[1:35:30] <Shishi1205> You go all the way then use local assault
[1:35:39] <Ultimatefool> Wait what does the super spinner do again?
[1:35:40] <BiscoitoCaboloso> Minh is too powerful rn he needs to go after him
[1:35:44] <%C4m3r0n0409> Woolie doesn't realize how valuable that place is
[1:35:45] <+itsOnyxLeo> Woolie forgot Minh has a field warp
[1:35:50] <+HDmexiqtioner> How are the pools doing?
[1:35:51] <+MrAtheGreat> Regardless of every decision, good or bad, chat is right. Thx Dokapon.
[1:35:54] <%DaBigVitus> minh sold field warp
[1:35:54] <$Noponiz> super spinner gives you 2-5 spinners every turn for a bunch of turns
[1:35:55] <Shishi1205> Or conquer them one by one while farming points
[1:35:57] <ExileNineteen> @lotharrio fair enough on the points. he'd get the kill in one day but yeah
[1:35:57] <zocano> Gives you random 2-5 spinners for like a week @ultimatefool
[1:36:03] <+IwuzPh34rless> Minh sold his warp
[1:36:03] <%Grayhammatter> HECK
[1:36:06] <%MyNameIsRasus> Minh is legit way too much of a threat right now
[1:36:07] <+Movemeister> lucky
[1:36:08] <%Daba_mk2> Minh sold the field warp
[1:36:13] <+itsOnyxLeo> As soon as Woolie takes a step inside, Minh will warp out
[1:36:21] <%Ashenik1> @BiscoitoCaboloso gives you mulitiple spinners for few turns
[1:36:21] <%fetrigon> @itsOnyxLeo he sold the field warp
[1:36:26] <%Balkespower> DAT DAMAGE
[1:36:27] <+itsOnyxLeo> Oh then RIP
[1:36:35] <Shishi1205> Yeah
[1:36:35] <%Balkespower> Number so high it broke Minh
[1:36:36] <%nintega010> @itsOnyxLeo he doesn't need to kill minh he needs the towns

[1:36:40] <%xcompleasedad> Yes?
[1:36:43] <+IwuzPh34rless> You have one of the best weapons period Minh
[1:36:47] <andrei11dr> Minh has shit loads of spinners and green spaces where he is , Woolie can't actually get him, unless he uses Come Here
[1:37:01] <+kknutson4> Woolie might as well keep going darkling, the other s are cowards they won't go for the final boxx
[1:37:01] <%SuperKirby24> so is woolie having reggie tier spins Kappa
[1:37:04] <+nekodelic> TEMPLE

[1:43:21] <rubbishbinge> all according to keikaku
[1:43:23] <%C4m3r0n0409> He can literally just take them back
[1:43:23] <%jiggy_snipe> he's aiming for global assault or he may take a castle
[1:43:25] <gamewarden92> Charm potions don't work on monsters.
[1:43:25] <+MetalPanic> maybe the real dokapons were the friends we made along the way
[1:43:27] <BurdRightsActivist> ResidentSleeper Woolie Darkling Turns ResidentSleeper
[1:43:27] <%xcompleasedad> YO

[1:43:45] <%Solidnick18> he got yarra
[1:43:45] <%yeetdabsenpai69> Minh will just charm potion it all back
[1:43:45] <%Ipsenscastle> Minh's field warp keeps him safe
[1:43:46] <%alpacasintophats> RECLAIM THE CAPITAL
[1:43:50] <randominternetsurfer> how many points does Woolie need for Global Assult?
[1:43:52] <Darren716> Reggie should get his passport when he has no towns
[1:43:53] <%gearcannon> woolie should just come here
[1:43:54] <%StryderStrikesAt> We are headed towards BALANCE
[1:43:57] <%KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the xp boost is gonna be nice
[1:43:58] <Rifleavenger> COME HERE, kill Minh, then flip his towns
[1:43:58] <LVDoomien> #TeamMinh
[1:44:01] <%nintega010> woolie is not gonna waist come here
[1:44:01] <reonome> LUL
[1:44:01] <WizardofWazz> Me too
[1:44:02] <+MrAtheGreat> @randominternetsurfer 200
[1:44:02] <FloresIsDead> I don't really get what woolie is trying to do tho
[1:44:05] <%MyNameIsRasus> @randominternetsurfer 200
[1:44:05] <+MrAtheGreat> I think
[1:44:07] <%tearknack> @SpookGato she's not bad, but theres been dozens of cuter and/or sexier devil girl type designs over the years
[1:44:07] <%LeaIsChill> I want Woolie to hit a Darkling home run
[1:44:08] <+IwuzPh34rless> Woolie needs enough points to "come here" and "Global domination"
[1:44:08] <%Sparkseid> LUL
[1:44:10] <%alpacasintophats> AND THEN PROCEED WITH THE ***GLOBAL ASSUALT STRATEGEM***
[1:44:11] <%DaBigVitus> Blessed Relief
[1:44:13] <andrei11dr> But he'll still need to give up half of his towns to get the passport
[1:44:13] <%Balkespower> THE DREAM!
[1:44:14] <%MrRabbles> the chosen one and the avatar of Dokapon are united
[1:44:14] <+Invlux> 🙏

[1:44:23] <%Amaideus> 1/4th towns
[1:44:23] <huskarl_zap> Why is the hero helping the villain?
[1:44:23] <%ekodrop> woolie, you don't want reggie's trash darkling luck
[1:44:24] <%jiggy_snipe> Woolie wants to kill Minh and wreck the world
[1:44:24] <%nintega010> Reggie and Woolie finally working together
[1:44:25] <Rifleavenger> Alternatively, Il Cartographo, but Minh has a lot of safe spaces in the tower
[1:44:26] <shujojo> power to the POCKETS
[1:44:28] <%StrifeZubia> SO AS I PRAY UNLIMITED DARKLINGTON WORKS
[1:44:28] <ExileNineteen> @tearknack how many of them have been in games from the oughts
[1:44:30] <%Grayhammatter> 200 and a dream

[1:44:40] <%DaBigVitus> damned if you do damned if you don't
[1:44:41] <WG101> HYUUGA
[1:44:42] <%Duke_of_HI> @QaizerArt Thank you for the gift sub
[1:44:42] <+BizarreRevolver> taking a castle would actually help woolie a lot
[1:44:43] <zocano> It’s gonna be real fucking annoying when darkling ends and woolie goes “man I should have just come here’d minh”
[1:44:47] <mdkcde> Reggie's power is not in himself but His Nakama
[1:44:48] <%CursedNobleman> helltaker has good demon girl designs
[1:44:49] <%MyNameIsRasus> THE DARKLINGTON MASTER PLAN
[1:44:52] <berasite> final solution wat?!
[1:44:53] <randominternetsurfer> CAN Woolie get 200 before his Darkling Days end?
[1:44:58] <sosaltymboy> the prize money should go into animating the dokapon anime intro
[1:45:07] <supercjk333> towns over everything
[1:45:12] <mdkcde> He's 120 already and 7 days
[1:45:12] <ExileNineteen> 400k...
[1:45:14] <mdkcde> so yeah
[1:45:16] <shujojo> ya boy needs 360 to take a castle and ruin the world
[1:45:18] <andrei11dr> But he already got world domination once and Minh is still first, why does he think it's a free win ?
[1:45:20] <ExileNineteen> not 4m, that's nuts
[1:45:20] <mdkcde> he can totally get to 200
[1:45:36] <%DaBigVitus> the do not disturb sign is in EFFECT
[1:45:38] <+Invlux> @sosaltymboy how much does hiring titmouse cost, I feel like you're on to something
[1:45:43] <shujojo> harness one last blessing of darkness from weber before going down to slay rico
[1:45:45] <jevichrono> Because of what happens at end game
[1:45:45] <%Amaideus> World domination now is much better than it was last time there was a darkling around
[1:45:46] <%Picia000123> gogogogo
[1:45:54] <%spacehouse> no shit
[1:45:54] <BurdRightsActivist> @andrei11dr let him believe what he wants to believe.
[1:45:55] <%MyNameIsRasus> Beeline to castle Reggie
[1:45:55] <%Grayhammatter> beeline to the castle
[1:46:00] <%jiggy_snipe> go to the castle
[1:46:00] <%MrRabbles> might as well go for the castle while everything is up in the air
[1:46:04] <Mr_Ease> World Domination is also good because Woolie has 4 castles
[1:46:04] <%kekkerscrew> get yourself to the castle
[1:46:06] <%jiggy_snipe> focus on the sidequest
[1:46:08] <FloresIsDead> can't stop hearing hoes mad whenever I hear the overworld theme
[1:46:08] <gunstar73> Yea go to the castle
[1:46:09] <Solidnick18> to dokapon
[1:46:19] <Mr_Ease> so if everyone loses their towns Woolie is in first regardless just cause of Castles
[1:46:19] <%tearknack> @randominternetsurfer depend son his darkling points rolls. theoretically, if every roll you were getting somewhere bwteen 50-100 points, you could hit 500 or higher darkling points
[1:46:25] <%jiggy_snipe> -_____-
[1:46:29] <%Superdandy96> Just get to the castle doka Reggie
[1:46:29] <Darren716> He need to get to the temple before Woolie uses "come here"

[1:49:05] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> I feel like killing Mihn and throwing away his stuff might be the play
[1:49:06] <nopgnikatnight> thanks every body
[1:49:06] <+Zenryoku21> Mihn has no castles, world reset might be devastating
[1:49:07] <%MyNameIsRasus> FINE
[1:49:07] <supercjk333> yes reggie aim for that casyle
[1:49:07] <+yayaoi> malfPain
[1:49:08] <plo135> @woolieversus Minh has a entire continent under his control on the other side of the map if you took that he wouldn't be able to do anything about it
[1:49:09] <%Grayhammatter> that's alright
[1:49:10] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[1:49:10] <andrei11dr> Well, Minh is also leveling up,and Reggie can gain more towns in Africa
[1:49:13] <Mr_Ease> heres the thing... taking a castle does nothing to Mihn
[1:49:25] <Maleicus> imagine getting the crystal choker
[1:49:28] <ExileNineteen> @plo135 the odds are good if he still can't get 200 that he'll take that one with local assault
[1:49:30] <Mr_Ease> or at least most likely does nothing to Mihn
[1:49:30] <ManiSolKatti> Big Dip
[1:49:34] <%CursedNobleman> how did woolie have that major crash?
[1:49:35] <Darren716> LUL

[1:50:00] <atravelbee> whats the blood and peace pull at?
[1:50:01] <RurouniGeo> Taking a Castle means Woolie can just go straight to Darklington again to try and clean up a 2nd time
[1:50:08] <Electro96> woolie's cause is too righteous for the evil power to manifest
[1:50:09] <%Fujiwara_92> 5 bois making some 5 joise
[1:50:10] <+Gespens> @DesertPenguin Towns mean less if you have no castles
[1:50:11] <imbuildinggundams> What if you wanted to overthrow Minh's lead but Dokapon said "5"
[1:50:14] <%Fujiwara_92> *noise
[1:50:15] <%Amaideus> @atravelbee Blood 4055

[1:50:16] <+McGwinnicus> LUL

[1:50:21] <BurdRightsActivist> GO UP
[1:50:24] <%tearknack> @atravelbee not sure about peace, blood is a bit above 4k
[1:50:26] <+DesertPenguin> Yea but 28 to 3 towns has gotta make a difference

[1:50:32] <%Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:50:33] <+DesertPenguin> How many castles does woolie have over minh?

[1:50:39] <plo135> if he local assualt just that continent it only affects Minh and it's so far charm potions wouldn't make sense to use
[1:50:41] <%Grayhammatter> these fucking rolls

[1:51:36] <%Grayhammatter> take as many of his towns as possible
[1:51:40] <%alpacasintophats> at least try to hold the points until the day before last
[1:51:42] <andrei11dr> Local Domination in South America would be a good idea

[1:52:58] <+Gespens> @jiggy_snipe Minh has castle #2, Woolie got the first castle
[1:53:01] <%Grayhammatter> woolie needs to snap up them towns, then kill minh

[1:53:29] <supercjk333> worth it mihn

[1:54:22] <%Ashenik1> I think taking away all twons is a better play than taking one castle. Woolie is where the most valuable cities are and Minh would went straight down to almost zero.
[1:54:26] <%DaBigVitus> it says right there
[1:54:28] <%zenith0111> There have been multiple good reasons to attack Minh but they never took the chance :(

[1:56:18] <%MrRabbles> Come here is a good move
[1:56:19] <+wolf34736> take south america from minh
[1:56:20] <%alpacasintophats> JUST A LITTLE LONGER MY FRIEND
[1:56:22] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> save you can do it
[1:56:23] <$SilverRoddo> I love these Dragonball battle continuations.
[1:56:23] <+Taglog7> ONE MORE TIME
[1:56:23] <Demoliboy2> save until the last turn
[1:56:23] <thatsmapizza2> you could local assault Africa
[1:56:27] <zocano> Castle Steal is useless
[1:56:27] <%royb2> global assault more important than castle, Minh has too many towns for a castle steal to matter
[1:56:32] <Shishi1205> Local assault is not worth
[1:56:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> Save it
[1:56:41] <+swjunke> and i join to see a darkling running around
[1:56:41] <%MrRabbles> Come here means minh has no money and charm potions
[1:56:41] <%Livelinne> sbfpGou sbfpGi
[1:56:42] <NeroInfinite> but yeah global assualt
[1:56:44] <zocano> Either global assault or come here
[1:56:46] <andrei11dr> Does Minh have escape?
[1:56:46] <berasite> loal assault only works on the continent you are in
[1:56:49] <Shishi1205> Only castle worth stealing is Africas
[1:56:50] <Klefth> Towns, so you can finally fuck Minh up
[1:56:57] <%MyNameIsRasus> WOW
[1:56:57] <%zenith0111> Stealing anything would help
[1:57:07] <andrei11dr> No he has Alchemy, that's right
[1:57:07] <+poodo89> come here seems pretty good
[1:57:07] <thatsmapizza2> you could also come here minh

[2:17:39] <+IwuzPh34rless> It eats magic too, so it'll be there for a while
[2:17:39] <%fetrigon> Woolie should block the exit out of Australia
[2:17:40] <Shishi1205> Race to africa for Reggie
[2:17:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> Did Reggie just say sorry to the monster he walked past?
[2:17:43] <SinisterBiscuits> Weber, hero of Dokapon.
[2:17:43] <%paladinstarbuster> Back to afrika
[2:17:54] <supercjk333> you going alchemist yet reggie
[2:17:55] <%zenith0111> CURSED
[2:17:58] <zocano> Reggie isn't quite strong enough for Heck yet
[2:17:59] <Paul_Cheenis_Big_Beenis> #ReggieGang
[2:17:59] <jevichrono> The Race to Africa is the best option right now
[2:18:00] <andrei11dr> Eh ,his an alchemist, hes fine
[2:18:01] <%Grayhammatter> huh... back to africa i guess
[2:18:01] <+Gespens> Reggie should either retake Africa, or go get the Acrobat Show Ticket
[2:18:01] <%CursedNobleman> socked right in the marbles
[2:18:03] <zocano> I mean he can grind in heck
[2:18:03] <Shishi1205> Every time you defend dark shield and cursed shield chip health
[2:18:07] <%jiggy_snipe> @Darren716 I don't think he could complete it, Woolie is really strong so he could survive
[2:18:10] <iggeh> So I missed Woolie going Darkling and using global domination? Anything else happen this stream?
[2:18:15] <%alpacasintophats> hey since there's only like 2 towns that have been claimed, what happens if someone were to go to heck now?
[2:18:19] <Darren716> He should at least get his passport now
[2:18:19] <%tearknack> @supercjk333 he seems to be staying spellsword for the deflection
[2:18:20] <zocano> Only Woolie is really strong enough to beat Rico
[2:18:23] <+Gespens> @iggeh Minh got a Big Bug
[2:18:23] <jevichrono> Anyone who beats rico wins the game...
[2:18:23] <%Livelinne> That’s a cool shield tho
[2:18:27] <%C4m3r0n0409> Woolie got 10 levels
[2:18:28] <%tearknack> @iggeh not really
[2:18:29] <Darren716> 25% of his towns would be nothing rn
[2:18:43] <+pyrojack6> SHIELDLESS WOOL
[2:18:44] <+McGwinnicus> RED CHEST
[2:18:47] <%zenith0111> If Minh goes Darkling shit is gonna get real
[2:18:49] <%jiggy_snipe> if Reggie could do heck right now, he would probably win
[2:18:50] <%topendbuzza> passport then towns woolz
[2:18:50] <%Grayhammatter> BLOOD CHEST
[2:18:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> As long as Reggie ups his health, he should be fine with the shield.
[2:18:51] <Bombin_Ramen> go to Heck
[2:18:51] <supercjk333> also once you get passport then go collect towns
[2:18:52] <Shishi1205> land yellow

[2:18:52] <%Superdandy96> RED CHESTO

[2:31:33] <%jiggy_snipe> its the hit chance tho
[2:31:36] <Gramcracker55> I think it's the same chance.
[2:31:36] <%Picia000123> just hit woolie at this point
[2:31:40] <Klefth> Woooow...
[2:31:43] <Sirmickle> Is Reggie's best chance to just make a run at Rico?
[2:31:45] <%Solidnick18> idk
[2:31:49] <+TetsuyaD> it's the same chance
[2:31:49] <+kewlmyc> should have killed the boss
[2:31:49] <%Th3SmartAlec> ???
[2:31:49] <%horse_oil> man im feeling secondhand stressed out from how much minh is running away with this
[2:31:55] <berasite> angel chocker revives
[2:31:56] <%C4m3r0n0409> GO FOR THE BOSS
[2:31:58] <%MrRabbles> oh i thought the necklace broke
[2:31:58] <lotharrio> Can't steal kill with field magic on monsters.
[2:32:03] <%fetrigon> Usually it's 20% but it's 0% because of the mirror necklace
[2:32:08] <ExileNineteen> @Sirmickle yes, but only because of what happens when the game ends, which none of them know
[2:32:09] <%Kriss1827> this is ridiculous
[2:32:10] <+C0rdak> Wait guys who's winning rn
[2:32:10] <BurdRightsActivist> @horse_oil Just let him win, just let Necrid win
[2:32:10] <%horse_oil> like i have proximity salt right now its wild
[2:32:14] <%Grayhammatter> go to heck
[2:32:18] <%Solidnick18> maybe the game will just die
[2:32:18] <armchairmaster_> Woolie the Immortal, Reggie the Unbreakable Fist, and Minh the Speedster
[2:32:19] <golfclubabby> Someone needs to kill minh but i have no idea how
[2:32:19] <WG101> M E O W
[2:32:22] <+Zenryoku21> Combo of speed and that necklace...
[2:32:24] <%Superdandy96> Might as well as go to heck Reggie
[2:32:26] <%A_DEAD_SHOW> M E O W
[2:32:27] <%emperordread> If that mirror makes him permantely immune to field magic - oh man there's gonna be a lotta pain
[2:32:27] <supercjk333> i am sure Rico SR is 10 million
[2:32:29] <%C4m3r0n0409> Just ignore Minh
[2:32:35] <DerpioParty> Blister the feet. Squall him
[2:32:39] <+teavian> M E O W
[2:32:44] <%b_aleph> What did Woolie do as the Darklington? lost about the last hour
[2:32:49] <%paladinstarbuster> Go kill him and take it
[2:32:51] <%DaBigVitus> woolie sounds dejected
[2:32:51] <jubejube56> @golfclubabby luckily Minh still left himself weak to battle magic
[2:32:56] <%horse_oil> no way minh is going to try and finish the game at this point, he will just trap then in the infinite tsukuyomi
[2:32:56] <supercjk333> also bonus money that are bonus stars
[2:32:58] <%Grayhammatter> kill him then
[2:33:02] <%emperordread> Thank Mew CoolCat
[2:33:02] <ManiSolKatti> This is why Woolie should have got the castle, because now Mihn is just gonna retake Australia again.
[2:33:03] <%paladinstarbuster> global domination
[2:33:05] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @b_aleph monster all towns
[2:33:06] <%kekkerscrew> Kill him and take it
[2:33:06] <%nintega010> @ExileNineteen it depends on how much of all of Australia adds up for them to be confident enough to go to heck
[2:33:07] <thesickestzak> Thank mew
[2:33:08] <+IwuzPh34rless> Gotta kill minh for his shit
[2:33:09] <+wicketpelican> @b_aleph he reseted the world with the town stuff
[2:33:09] <WizardofWazz> think woolie will try to get spellsword now?
[2:33:10] <%spacehouse> Woolie Knows what he must do...
[2:33:12] <Idon__> Aight, just caught up with the anime, is woolie still in heck and is minh still winning?
[2:33:15] <evilaltruistic> who's winning?
[2:33:17] <%C4m3r0n0409> Woolie knows nothing wym
[2:33:20] <%b_aleph> @reverend_roscoe niiiice
[2:33:21] <Xeno351> passports are basically free right now though
[2:33:25] <$QueequegTheater> strike
[2:33:26] <%Fujiwara_92> KILL HIM AND TAKEIT
[2:33:28] <%GenesisKnight> @evilaltruistic it's complicated
[2:33:29] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Kill Mihn and take his neclace from him
[2:33:29] <lotharrio> Well the answer is to fight Minh and kill him.
[2:33:31] <BurdRightsActivist> @spacehouse Lose. KappaPride
[2:33:32] <+IwuzPh34rless> He'd have to master warrior. it's not worth going spellsword
[2:33:34] <%zenith0111> Mirror Necklace just forces you to directly attack him. Which you should have been doing a loooong time ago
[2:33:34] <%emperordread> You can do it Woolie
[2:33:35] <%DaBigVitus> why didn't he soul fire earlier
[2:33:36] <evilaltruistic> !uptime
[2:33:36] <ExileNineteen> @nintega010 welp, australia is basically always going to be minh's so they need to retake the rest of the map
[2:33:37] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 33 minutes
[2:33:43] <%jiggy_snipe> you have a revival so you much as well strke
[2:33:44] <%MrRabbles> castle value wouldn't be that high compared to towns especially when its a random castle
[2:33:45] <+kewlmyc> coward
[2:33:46] <%Daba_mk2> waht
[2:33:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> @zenith0111 Minh gives up the moment anyone tries to fight him.

[2:34:22] <%zenith0111> @commandersqueaks You get access to take everything but towns right?
[2:34:23] <gunstar73> Bruh
[2:34:26] <thesickestzak> I miss the big balls and bravery from the start of the stream :(
[2:34:27] <ExileNineteen> minh has 100 defense over that thing's attack, he wouldn't even have died to that strike
[2:34:28] <%C4m3r0n0409> Woolie wasted his best oppurtunity
[2:34:28] <$QueequegTheater> MIGATTE NO MINH
[2:34:28] <%2hutown> I don't think Wools was confident in his shieldless def. Didnt want to waste more turns fighting
[2:34:31] <notgarza> pain
[2:34:31] <%MrRabbles> is minh at speed cap?
[2:34:35] <HotHungryHurricane> speed is broken. like ruse in final fantasy 1, if you have 90%+ evasion you are OP as shit.
[2:34:37] <BurdRightsActivist> MINH WINHS
[2:34:37] <%legacy0117> So, are you guys gonna go for the hidden classes or no? Maybe after collecting to towns up first, of course.
[2:34:38] <%zenith0111> @commandersqueaks Giving Up isn't a full proof back down
[2:34:41] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @Uberchao
[2:34:41] <%DaBigVitus> pendulum swung so hard it's off the chain
[2:34:44] <%C4m3r0n0409> Minh is Winning
[2:34:45] <ManiSolKatti> Castles are much harder to lose though, while Mihn can just Charm Potion his way to victory.
[2:34:45] <%xcompleasedad> Congratulations, Woolie. You have accomplished nothing.
[2:34:47] <+Invlux> I just read what happens at the end of the game and WOWWWWW
[2:34:50] <%jiggy_snipe> oh that's right Woolie doesn't have a shield
[2:34:51] <%xcompleasedad> ALWAYS KILL MINH
[2:34:55] <%xcompleasedad> NOTHING ELSE MATTERS
[2:34:56] <%jiggy_snipe> oh
[2:34:56] <ExileNineteen> @C4m3r0n0409 how did he waste it vs. getting squalled off by minh
[2:34:56] <%Picia000123> YEYEYEE
[2:34:58] <%jiggy_snipe> it tells you
[2:35:04] <%zenith0111> Woolie lost first place once from giving up none stop
[2:35:05] <%Grayhammatter> gotta kill minh now
[2:35:27] <%kekkerscrew> invest
[2:35:27] <%Superdandy96> Get to heck!
[2:35:32] <%jiggy_snipe> you should grab a passport because you only have 2 towns
[2:35:33] <SethKyu> Stock up, and head to heck
[2:35:39] <supercjk333> invest to play safe
[2:35:40] <+Zenryoku21> technically this might be the best time to get a passport? minimal towns
[2:35:45] <%C4m3r0n0409> The Darkling plan seemed dumb from the start
[2:35:46] <+Grayhammatter> grab a passport, head to heck
[2:35:47] <FloresIsDead> kill mihn because he know how to play this game
[2:35:47] <zocano> ya grabbing a passport now is a smart move
[2:35:48] <+IwuzPh34rless> Woolie lost first because of Mitch Digger
[2:35:49] <%Picia000123> take the contract first I would say
[2:35:49] <%paladinstarbuster> get passport'
[2:35:50] <+Invlux> thinking about Reggie pushing on into Heck to end the game monkaS
[2:35:51] <%Nekros4442> This is the best chance to get a passport
[2:35:56] <ExileNineteen> guys if he gets a passport minh will just purse cutter it
[2:35:56] <supercjk333> castle investment is also strong
[2:35:58] <+pectusumbra> So what fresh hell have I missed today?
[2:36:00] <+Zenryoku21> can you field warp out of heck?
[2:36:00] <SethKyu> What items does he have, though?
[2:36:07] <andrei11dr> Reggie's goal should be to take Africa
[2:36:10] <SethKyu> He might wants some heals before heading in
[2:36:11] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Karma!
[2:36:11] <%SomersaultJustice> roadblock rock sound like some 50s song
[2:36:11] <%MyNameIsRasus> YES
[2:36:12] <Mr_Ease> Yarra is safe!
[2:36:22] <mikeyjay47> Reggie make a break for rico. passports a practically free now.
[2:36:22] <%MyNameIsRasus> BIG BUG CAME THROUGH
[2:36:25] <BurdRightsActivist> Go buy more 4Head
[2:36:27] <Idon__> NO
[2:36:33] <%nintega010> @ExileNineteen he can't purse cut since he will be in heck. unless minh has come here
[2:36:44] <+pectusumbra> clearly a darkling has occurred
[2:36:47] <%bread_assassin> Reggie's in first place now, right? He needs to rush Heck to end the game ASAP.
[2:36:48] <Sloppy_Lines> until he buys another one with his infinite money
[2:36:51] <zocano> Reggie won't be able to beat Rico
[2:36:54] <%zenith0111> Even if you attack Minh and he gives up it's still as good as winning
[2:36:55] <Shishi1205> Clutch Yarra taking woolie
[2:37:02] <%Grayhammatter> wow, no breaks
[2:37:09] <supercjk333> i think reggie can beat clonus and rico
[2:37:11] <ExileNineteen> @nintega010 reggie 100% does not want to go to heck, i wasn't sure if people just want him to pick up the passport and immediately come out
[2:37:30] <Mr_Ease> he should get the passport while he has no towns
[2:37:30] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:37:35] <Shishi1205> Remember they have to beat their clonus
[2:37:36] <%jiggy_snipe> Reggie should grab the passport, he doesn't have to stay in heck
[2:37:39] <mdkcde> How come Rico Jr. only comes after Pockets? Is it a crush?
[2:37:42] <%nintega010> Woolie doesn't need to beat clonus again I believe
[2:37:42] <FloresIsDead> woolie is s i l e n t
[2:37:52] <Shishi1205> Btw Woolie was extremely lucky to find his clonus at the first try
[2:37:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> Go to heck, get passport, leave heck, get towns.
[2:37:55] <%Superdandy96> Stock up
[2:37:55] <supercjk333> but if it is mihns clonus then do give up or leave that fight
[2:37:56] <+Invlux> there's hardly even banter any more, just stress LUL
[2:37:56] <%jiggy_snipe> maybe beat his clonus while he's there
[2:37:56] <Shishi1205> They are set
[2:37:56] <ExileNineteen> and again, if reggie doesn't stay in heck he will immediately get purse cutter'd by minh
[2:37:59] <+Gespens> Reggie should REALLY work on getting Hero...
[2:38:00] <BurdRightsActivist> Woolie to SCURRED to lose
[2:38:01] <ExileNineteen> and lose that passport
[2:38:01] <%C4m3r0n0409> Yea Woolie can just go straight to Rico
[2:38:06] <golfclubabby> so should woolie get a shield and rush heck?
[2:38:14] <+prime_name> 4 thousand on the line
[2:38:14] <+Gespens> and Woolie should go get Lost Technology
[2:38:17] <aloveidiots> Remember when Woolie was all cocky?
[2:38:20] <%SuperKirby24> oh yeah reggie hasnt even met his clonus yet LUL
[2:38:21] <%C4m3r0n0409> Yep
[2:38:21] <+BizarreRevolver> woolie can 100% win if he made a beeline to rico
[2:38:26] <Shishi1205> @golfclubabby the faster the does the better
[2:38:33] <Idon__> Stonks go WAY down
[2:38:36] <andrei11dr> Woolie realized that he fucked up when ho took that contract
[2:38:36] <%C4m3r0n0409> At this point whoever kills Rico wins
[2:38:38] <zocano> Woolie needs a shield first
[2:38:38] <ExileNineteen> *ghostly minh noises*
[2:38:39] <%nintega010> Woolie could get lost tech since it feels no one is going anywhere
[2:38:40] <supercjk333> woolie did well geting that 1/3 chance in getting the clonus
[2:38:44] <+Gespens> Woolie is in FIRST
[2:38:48] <%sjay449> Despite watching this.... I still don't know what the win condition for this game is
[2:38:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> Might as well use the potion
[2:38:50] <BurdRightsActivist> AW YEAH POTIONS
[2:38:51] <Personified134> wait how the hell did woolie get back in front?
[2:38:56] <golfclubabby> darkling

[2:38:59] <supercjk333> darkling
[2:38:59] <%bread_assassin> You probably get a castle for beating Rico, right? Depending on how much its worth, Woolie might not be able to win even with it.

[2:40:43] <%Th3SmartAlec> GOOD JOB
[2:40:44] <ExileNineteen> @sjay449 they're grinding for position, they don't know what will happen when the game ends so they want to be confident that they will win if they finish
[2:40:48] <%nintega010> @sjay449 not really. they are trying to get to a point where beating heck they can still win
[2:40:52] <%jiggy_snipe> is Wallce secretly Barret?
[2:40:52] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Did Mihn forget Woolie has multiple soul mops?
[2:40:52] <%Grayhammatter> soul mop my dude

[2:41:05] <megamonmon123> This is gonna go f
[2:41:06] <+IwuzPh34rless> So does Wallace just pop up? Or is he on the board somewhere?

[2:41:21] <%0rond> you gotta burn through this soul burns like legendary resistances

[2:41:26] <ManiSolKatti> Woolie should either Zerg rush Rico, or get Wallace and maybe Lost Tech
[2:41:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> Get him away from Rabble tower
[2:41:27] <%0rond> soul mops*

[2:49:04] <+BizarreRevolver> with the skeleton key, woolie can get a shield while in hell

[2:49:17] <Shishi1205> The shield in hell is the dark shield
[2:49:19] <%dollarstored> he shoulda used it to trap minh
[2:49:20] <supercjk333> Even Tom Nook Fears Chance Boutique
[2:49:21] <%Amaideus> Block is your current space
[2:49:31] <%Superdandy96> Get that rock outta here. Unless Reggie Roadblocks the short way to heck
[2:49:32] <%Amaideus> I don't think there's one you can just place wherever
[2:49:35] <Shishi1205> best second one but drains some hp if you block
[2:49:38] <+lugraylucid> Hey chat, how far away are they from beating the game?
[2:49:39] <%Grayhammatter> we stocking up
[2:49:44] <thatsmapizza2> Woolie you should go back to heck and go for the blood chest down there
[2:49:48] <%Nekros4442> GO FOR RICO
[2:49:49] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @lugraylucid just the final boss
[2:49:49] <%C4m3r0n0409> HECK
[2:49:50] <%krispen_wa> depends on how fast Reggie decides to go to heck

[2:50:01] <megamonmon123> @lugraylucid they are in the endgame but its gonna take a bit
[2:50:02] <%emperordread> many skele

[2:50:13] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @mdkcde yes
[2:50:14] <berasite> YES @mdkcde

[2:50:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> @yeetdabsenpai69 That could be today that could be 4 literal weeks from now.
[2:50:27] <Shishi1205> Lectro

[2:50:42] <DerpioParty> U8
[2:50:43] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @CommanderSqueaks true but probably 1 or 2 streams

[2:51:00] <DiscoDur0> MAGIC KEY IN HECK is the way
[2:51:01] <%CursedNobleman> LUL
[2:51:03] <+Gespens> @yeetdabsenpai69 with how they're playing, it is likely gonna be in three weeks

[2:51:19] <+SaltyGhostRock> @yeetdabsenpai69 im thinking 3 or 4 because of how much they are just trying to fuck each other over
[2:51:20] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie can clutch this out
[2:51:30] <%topendbuzza> does minh have no castles?
[2:51:30] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @SaltyGhostRock also true
[2:51:30] <NekoUrabe> How long has the stream been going?
[2:51:31] <+prime_name> Woolie reset the whole board
[2:51:32] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:51:40] <%yeetdabsenpai69> but i don't expect it to be that bad
[2:51:45] <ExileNineteen> they're fucking each other over because there's 4k on the line
[2:51:45] <%Grayhammatter> to HECK
[2:51:50] <Shishi1205> Yo if woolie gets the goose dude with the tax he is loaded

[2:53:42] <Klefth> Get Wallace. The local item value is huge
[2:53:44] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @CursedNobleman depends
[2:53:46] <Leonheart777> The Hero got in town bois
[2:53:47] <SethKyu> He's got a good ability, and two elixers,
[2:53:48] <%emperordread> Reggie gonna tear up heck like Spawn
[2:53:48] <supercjk333> Race in on but first mirror match
[2:53:49] <%krispen_wa> Can Woolie still use Skeleton Key if he's under Lockdown?
[2:53:50] <mx3orange> reggie boutta die in hell
[2:53:50] <Mr_Ease> Reggie has to defeat his Clonus, woolie probably doesn't
[2:53:52] <SethKyu> Alos tons of spinners
[2:53:52] <+Zenryoku21> Did Reg bring elixers?
[2:53:52] <%C4m3r0n0409> You level up fast in heck
[2:53:54] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @CursedNobleman probably not
[2:53:56] <%DaBigVitus> woolie may have overall best stats
[2:53:57] <+IwuzPh34rless> Woolie trying to get into Heck before Minh can take his keys
[2:53:57] <Mr_Ease> and Woolie is in first
[2:53:58] <ExileNineteen> woolie already killed his
[2:53:58] <Shishi1205> Reggie can kill but his clonus can also get him killed fast
[2:53:59] <SethKyu> I think REggie could do it
[2:54:01] <lotharrio> @CursedNobleman He's got good gear and better items going in than Woolie did.
[2:54:03] <berasite> @krispen_wa yea
[2:54:03] <%GrassCannon> Reggie's going to get trashed
[2:54:04] <gunstar73> Woolie has 2 get a shield and he can clutch it
[2:54:14] <SethKyu> He needs to defeat his clone, tho
[2:54:20] <supercjk333> i am going to guess reggies clonus will be at the bottom of map
[2:54:22] <Leonavius> so is there a mechanical reason for why Strike never failed down there?
[2:54:26] <berasite> HEAL first
[2:54:26] <%yeetdabsenpai69> WELCOME TO HECK
[2:54:27] <andrei11dr> Somehow the chimera looks more powerful than the king chimera

[3:24:20] <%alpacasintophats> @andrei11dr the prequels at least added some things of value that gave rise to better things. Ex. Clone Wars. All the sequels have done is kill the shit out of the ending the original trilogy had by ruining anakin's sacrifice at the end and teased some neat ideas and never do them. Ever. And also broke in universe laws.

[3:35:49] <%CursedNobleman> theyre gonna tag team minh so hard LUL
[3:35:49] <+violet_city> oh my god he should totally get rid one one of them and force woolie and reggie to fight over the remaining one
[3:35:50] <+Urdunngurdunn> Hunt Down The FreeMinh
[3:35:50] <%Th3SmartAlec> If Reggie and Minh get in conflict, Woolie can waltz to victory
[3:35:51] <%A_DEAD_SHOW> Mihn's the tactician
[3:35:52] <thatsmapizza2> BLOOD CHEST
[3:35:53] <%Grayhammatter> red chest time
[3:35:53] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> kill Mihn, kill Mihn, KILL MIHN
[3:35:53] <ExileNineteen> as of RIGHT NOW, whoever finishes the game wins. minh can fuck around all he wants but he's actually overconfident
[3:35:54] <+C0rdak> Y'all need to start hunting
[3:35:58] <sendart> break his fingers
[3:35:59] <Darkdrill> Minh is outplaying everyone Reggie and woolie need to team up
[3:36:03] <supercjk333> luck is a skill
[3:36:04] <Shishi1205> You need red loot
[3:36:13] <%Ipsenscastle> I dont see Woolie doubling back to fight Minh
[3:36:13] <%Amaideus> It's further right
[3:36:14] <thatsmapizza2> further right
[3:36:14] <Shishi1205> More to the right
[3:36:14] <imbuildinggundams> Minh forces everyone to play his game
[3:36:15] <+Gespens> RIGHT
[3:36:16] <Leonavius> skeleton key the red
[3:36:16] <zocano> There's a red chest in the bottom right
[3:36:16] <Rifleavenger> Further right
[3:36:17] <lessthanhuman_tv> B L O O D
[3:36:18] <ManiSolKatti> RIGHT
[3:36:18] <coldfire0007> Minh cant win if he just stays out of the fight though, right?
[3:36:19] <%Grayhammatter> red chest in the corner
[3:36:19] <iggeh> red one is bottom right
[3:36:20] <%topendbuzza> right more
[3:36:20] <%alpacasintophats> further right
[3:36:20] <%Nekros4442> Right more?
[3:36:21] <%spacehouse> LOWER RIGHT
[3:36:22] <%Th3SmartAlec> there's a blood down there
[3:36:23] <+Mendin> Hell Blood Chest
[3:36:25] <mdkcde> further right
[3:36:26] <AppleBoi85> woolie go back out and get a shield
[3:36:27] <supercjk333> i dont think reggie and woolie know what team up is
[3:36:28] <%Fujiwara_92> more right
[3:36:30] <Xeno351> minh needs to bum rush towns, if it's a race he might actually win
[3:36:37] <%Th3SmartAlec> there you go
[3:36:46] <%zenith0111> Oh yeah Woolie has no shield LUL
[3:36:47] <Rifleavenger> If Minh pulls ahead far enough in cash and towns, he can win even if somone else defeats Rico
[3:36:50] <ExileNineteen> minh being a very nice boy by clarifying the key for woolie, i will give it to him
[3:36:52] <Shishi1205> Nah woolie stay here and get the shield from there
[3:36:54] <%krispen_wa> What if Minh Item Tricksters all his skeleton keys
[3:37:04] <mdkcde> Woolie has 3
[3:37:05] <ExileNineteen> @Rifleavenger he isn't reclaiming the map though, he's just alchy farming
[3:37:10] <lotharrio> @coldfire0007 That's the frustrating thing. He's playing delay tactics until he has an overwhelmingly onesided advantage, THEN he wants to let things end.
[3:37:13] <mdkcde> why hasn't his alchemist triggered already?
[3:37:15] <+IwuzPh34rless> Wasn't there a red loot box on the left side?
[3:37:16] <supercjk333> yeah. but that flex though if mihn beats rico and has the most towns still
[3:37:17] <mdkcde> It's been ages
[3:37:27] <%Ashenik1> What matteris the most in the end, total or town value?
[3:37:27] <%Grayhammatter> a lot
[3:37:29] <Shishi1205> just go there
[3:37:32] <%Amaideus> 12ish
[3:37:33] <%Th3SmartAlec> start moving
[3:37:33] <Rifleavenger> I mean, alch farming can win the game alone, but Minh also said he won't do the alch-invest strat so...
[3:37:35] <supercjk333> big hero moment if he doescthat
[3:37:40] <%C4m3r0n0409> LOSE

[3:44:04] <%Ipsenscastle> why does Woolie expect Reggie to do his dirty work for him while he strolls all the way through hell?
[3:44:05] <%Th3SmartAlec> Yeah attack
[3:44:08] <%C4m3r0n0409> DF
[3:44:08] <ExileNineteen> m guard DX
[3:44:10] <%Th3SmartAlec> That IS wierd
[3:44:12] <%insomniacCoder> @Amaideus minh sold 1 passport then tried to rob shop
[3:44:13] <+nekodelic> DF
[3:44:15] <%Solidnick18> idk
[3:44:16] <+violet_city> @mussyplussy he only sold one
[3:44:17] <%Th3SmartAlec> Nice
[3:44:18] <%C4m3r0n0409> HIS DF IS TOO HIGH
[3:44:24] <ExileNineteen> m guard DX gives massive passive reduction to magic
[3:44:25] <Shishi1205> Df too chunky
[3:44:26] <%yeknomlive> golem overthought it
[3:44:29] <%Th3SmartAlec> Noooooo
[3:44:30] <%MyNameIsRasus> MY DEFENSE IS TOO HIGH GAMER GIRL
[3:44:31] <mussyplussy> @violet_city Oh my bad then, I thought he did it for both
[3:44:34] <SethKyu> Golem is electric resist, no?
[3:44:43] <berasite> yes
[3:44:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[3:44:51] <$Noponiz> defense magic applies damage reudction passively @WoolieVersus . The command is just like defend, Another chunk on top
[3:45:10] <$Noponiz> magic guard dx is a whopping 90% passive reduction
[3:45:15] <%Grayhammatter> buy some magic, and blast his ass
[3:45:17] <ExileNineteen> so the annoying thing here is that i 100% believe minh knows how the game ends
[3:45:21] <$Noponiz> nothing is going past that
[3:45:30] <ExileNineteen> so he's probably going to charge heck now
[3:45:34] <supercjk333> good call reggie
[3:45:38] <%Th3SmartAlec> phew
[3:45:42] <%Amaideus> Considering people wouldn't shut up about it, he probably does now

[3:45:46] <%Amaideus> know*
[3:45:50] <%DaBigVitus> him being all coy like "oh i read the comments on youtube, and discord. if someone says something i can't help it."
[3:45:50] <RurouniGeo> @ExileNineteen yeah someone probably told him so Minh knows more than Woolie and Reggie

[3:52:58] <+thesw1tch> @tearknack lol ok so you clearly never had a significant other
[3:52:58] <ExileNineteen> i mean, if this was an actual competitive game "cheater" might carry some weight

[4:01:39] <%DaBigVitus> this is better than game of thrones
[4:01:40] <%legacy0117> Aw, I was expecting level 80
[4:01:43] <ManiSolKatti> Get the red chest and kill Rico
[4:01:47] <ManiSolKatti> You win easy
[4:01:49] <golfclubabby> Minh gonna read the discord and win
[4:01:49] <supercjk333> mihn is blending reggie and woolie into 1
[4:01:49] <+andyfutrell> because they are only being try hards because of the bet @zenith0111
[4:01:54] <%Picia000123> No Titanfall games currently in production, maaaan :(
[4:01:54] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:01:57] <supercjk333> the true alchemist
[4:02:00] <ExileNineteen> the thing that hurt woolie the most this session was his shield breaking and that had nothing to do with the other people on the couch
[4:02:01] <%Amaideus> Lmao
[4:02:03] <%nothuzad> true alchem
[4:02:06] <%nothuzad> at work
[4:02:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie only cares about wealth, he doesn't care about getting... aw shit I lost my n-pass.
[4:02:11] <lemon_lore> if they team up to fight minh is only way
[4:02:12] <%Amaideus> Minh would still be stalling like a madman without any money on the line
[4:02:14] <Sloppy_Lines> still salty about the wabbit
[4:02:15] <+bizzer10> at least you saved they dog woolie
[4:02:15] <Darkdrill> Minh is the only person who hasn't been a darkling
[4:02:17] <+thesw1tch> @c0rdak they have about 4k to lose
[4:02:18] <%Picia000123> Minh is a pupeteer master
[4:02:20] <%TimetodiveLTX> I was born a puppet and I will die hollow
[4:02:21] <+bizzer10> your the real hero
[4:02:28] <%TimetodiveLTX> fuck video games
[4:02:28] <shujojo> you don't get to do the task because minh is a horrible player
[4:02:30] <%zenith0111> @andyfutrell I haven't heard try hard since 4th grade
[4:02:34] <%krispen_wa> Africk
[4:02:36] <supercjk333> better start reading your book again mihn
[4:02:41] <%Amaideus> I love this shit
[4:02:43] <shujojo> cheap tactics all around
[4:02:44] <+C0rdak> Haha yea true
[4:02:44] <ExileNineteen> minh is by far the best dokapon kingdom player on the couch
[4:02:44] <supercjk333> that art of war stando
[4:02:48] <%Ipsenscastle> nothing really went wrong for Woolie this session, the fact that he didn't die in hell and gained so many levels was crazy luck
[4:02:49] <SinisterBiscuits> Minh doesn't play to win he plays to make everyone else lose.
[4:02:50] <Lionkevinson> Afrique
[4:02:52] <%Amaideus> @ExileNineteen Exacccctly
[4:02:53] <ExileNineteen> unfortunately, this also makes him a scum human Kappa
[4:02:54] <+jordy_j_s> Nah Woolie's the only one playing mindgames
[4:02:57] <%Solidnick18> afreak
[4:02:57] <Darkdrill> woolie you need to give Minh his darkling pass
[4:03:04] <+jordy_j_s> If Minh was the best he'd be getting towns
[4:03:04] <andrei11dr> Also guess what, they Global Domination didn't matter as much as everyone thought, Minh is still first and Reggie is one town from becoming second
[4:03:05] <golfclubabby> Why does minh think he can take rico?
[4:03:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> @darkdrill Towns have ALWAYS been his strength, so turning Darkling would have been nothing, but a loss for him.
[4:03:08] <%DaBigVitus> man they coulda gone another hour
[4:03:14] <supercjk333> Woolie is mvp in that stream for resetting the universe
[4:03:16] <Shishi1205> You still retained Yarra tho Woolie
[4:03:21] <%jiggy_snipe> it mattered
[4:03:26] <%Amaideus> The domination totally mattered, what
[4:03:28] <Shishi1205> Yarra is yours there
[4:03:28] <%zenith0111> "Booo this sucks they want win" NotLikeThis
[4:03:32] <%Amaideus> There was a gigantic gap before
[4:03:33] <ExileNineteen> the thing is that this game is a scum game for scum, so minh being the best player is paradoxically making me want him to win the least
[4:03:34] <%krispen_wa> @andrei11dr except now there's far less of a gap between woolie and everyone else. If he kills Rico he can ACTUALLY win now
[4:03:39] <%legacy0117> Yes, but has basically been playing the Meta of this game the hardest. Abusing Meta gets you hate, and enough hate gets everyone else wanting to pummel you.
[4:03:42] <Decimated_body> Hard reset and Minh still first LMAO LUl
[4:03:48] <FloresIsDead> but when are they gonna fistfight each other tho
[4:03:49] <%legacy0117> Minh*
[4:03:55] <RurouniGeo> Jokes on them if they think they are going to finish this LP on Saturday tppowerFree tppowerFree tppowerFree
[4:03:56] <%DaBigVitus> i cant wait to see how the game fucks you even when yo beat rico
[4:03:58] <Joestar1890> Did they check out Ghosts of Tsushima? or are they going to check it out after the stream ends?
[4:04:02] <Shishi1205> Geting yarra was a good play @WoolieVersus
[4:04:02] <InXplotch> are they slowing down dokapon uploads on teh channel?
[4:04:06] <%Superbro64> @legacy0117 what exactly is the meta minh is playing?
[4:04:14] <redstrawherring> @amaideus It flipped the board over but he didn't capitialize on it
[4:04:15] <Shishi1205> You still have it, and its the one that boosts your castle
[4:04:20] <%DaBigVitus> a minh to the past
[4:04:21] <%ChoculaUltra> just tape knives to you hands for the next session - problem solved.
[4:04:21] <%jiggy_snipe> @InXplotch it was caught up to right before this stream
[4:04:25] <%Reverend_Roscoe> Mood lighting
[4:04:28] <Mattxii> is woolie still in heck?
[4:04:29] <supercjk333> when is the next stream
[4:04:30] <InXplotch> got it
[4:04:34] <%legacy0117> Squall spam, and spell hoarding, picking Alchemist first.
[4:04:37] <andrei11dr> But ,i was expecting for Minh to get way more towns but then big bug happened and portions went to shit
[4:04:44] <%Superbro64> @legacy0117 10 4
[4:04:47] <%legacy0117> And plenty of other things
[4:04:47] <+andyfutrell> what I mean is they are taking this game way to serious I have always thought being salty over a game was stupid @zenith0111
[4:04:48] <%jiggy_snipe> maybe make a 2nd channel for uploading vods?
[4:04:54] <%TimetodiveLTX> it's a patreon reward now
[4:04:54] <%Irridium> could do a separate archive channel on youtube
[4:05:02] <%zenith0111> At least keep the footage of you guys in the LPs
[4:05:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> Would you ever consider creating a new Youtube channel just for the unedited streams?
[4:05:08] <ExileNineteen> andy, the name of this group content is "salt party"
[4:05:08] <+greatmonorail> Nuke the VODs
[4:05:10] <Leonavius> i only got a WIP so far, but how could I post this POCKETS
[4:05:11] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @WoolieVersus Just upload the stream as WoolieVS Unedited
[4:05:23] <Darkdrill> woolie I want to see your face
[4:05:24] <%tearknack> sub route would be fine, i think?
[4:05:26] <%elbigante> vinny vinesauce does a separate channel for small banter between main streams
[4:05:26] <%jiggy_snipe> WoolieVs After Dark Kappa
[4:05:27] <%ChoculaUltra> @CommanderSqueaks WoolieUnedited
[4:05:31] <%wolfofsound> most people do sub route
[4:05:34] <sendart> I aint gonna watch youtube no matter what you do
[4:05:35] <%Spydurman> Sub lock the vods
[4:05:35] <%Javaa01> Yeah, sub would be fine
[4:05:37] <%dark_fire_fly> How do VoDs hurt?
[4:05:41] <%tearknack> yeah, thats what i like about the vods; i get to see the faces
[4:05:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> @choculaultra WoolieVsVOds
[4:05:42] <+LynbellDaYo> just do subs, yeah
[4:05:44] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> @WoolieVersus getting Yara was the right play. Your only other option was to just hound Mihn and murder him, but at the time he could run from you indefinitely.
[4:05:45] <+C0rdak> I don't think we can really complain about the blood pool pressuring plays when we as the chat introduced it
[4:05:46] <+thesw1tch> @superbro64 he looked up strats to figure out what to do, like spamming squalls, learning what alchemy can do and saving a fuckton of spells
[4:05:46] <Frostydough1> ONLYFANS VODS
[4:05:46] <JetpackMcQuack> Stolen views
[4:05:48] <Darkdrill> add the face cam on YouTube please
[4:05:49] <%Fujiwara_92> you do you, but damn
[4:05:49] <%ChoculaUltra> oh that one sounds doper
[4:05:50] <%guyalex> have you thought about uploading highlights of the stream to YouTube? 15ish min clips of the best bits that you cut from the upload??
[4:05:50] <BurdRightsActivist> how do vods hurt??
[4:05:52] <%DaBigVitus> but you get subs during the stream.
[4:05:54] <%Reverend_Roscoe> Sub lock or upload VODS to youtube
[4:05:58] <%Daba_mk2> sub route wouldn't be that bad
[4:06:00] <%Spydurman> @dark_fire_fly people watch vods instead of youtube and he gets no money from that
[4:06:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> @burdrightsactivist No monetization
[4:06:02] <%zenith0111> @andyfutrell I don't know how you lasted this long in a LP titled SALT PARTY. So I don't understand what you were expecting
[4:06:04] <ExileNineteen> clearly the answer to the blood pool dominating the meta is to donate to the peace pool Kappa
[4:06:10] <+thesw1tch> lock the vods to subs so you get some cash
[4:06:11] <vVAstrAVv> sub lock works really
[4:06:11] <+tymetak> Hes gonna go Canada Cup on the Vods NotLikeThis
[4:06:12] <+Velloriaa> Sub lock VODs
[4:06:13] <SethKyu> Sub only scans :0
[4:06:14] <%LeaIsChill> I will sub regardless, but if you lock it it`s fine
[4:06:15] <%SuperKirby24> woolievs onlyfans LUL
[4:06:18] <golfclubabby> make a stream VOD youtube channel or sub lock them
[4:06:18] <%DaBigVitus> there is like one stream left. don't lock now
[4:06:22] <%Superbro64> @thesw1tch he directly stated at the beginning of the stream that he doesnt do that
[4:06:23] <Frostydough1> @BurdRightsActivist because he doesnt get the ad revenue from would be youtube watcher because they just watched it on twitch
[4:06:25] <%tearknack> @dark_fire_fly @BurdRightsActivist you get basically NO money off of vods, they aren't monetized, people watch them instead of the youtube videos
[4:06:33] <Shishi1205> They run multiple ads (at least for me)
[4:06:37] <ExileNineteen> i started watching the manga eventually and it's the one ad at the start and that's it
[4:06:41] <%OldManDeckardCain> just upload the non lp bits as bonus parts
[4:06:43] <%Javaa01> Yeah, that ad on the VoD is only for Twitch
[4:06:50] <%ekodrop> Woolie, just upload these parts as EXTRAS on youtube
[4:06:55] <Shishi1205> But yeah the ad is for twitch
[4:06:55] <+thesw1tch> @superbro64 he also said he cant unlearn what he learned
[4:06:57] <%Javaa01> The stremers don't make money off of those VoD ads
[4:06:57] <%OldManDeckardCain> more views that way
[4:06:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> @ekodrop Agreed
[4:06:58] <Shishi1205> not for the cannel
[4:06:59] <arkv01> could start limiting vods to subs like with CSB
[4:07:00] <+C0rdak> Include the post game discussions yo
[4:07:00] <suitangi021> Does running youtube playlist in the background help you?
[4:07:00] <%Amaideus> I'd watch on youtube if the entire thing was uploaded all at once
[4:07:02] <SethKyu> Sub lock the Vods until the Youtube catches up?
[4:07:19] <RurouniGeo> I see an ad every 30 minutes or so on other VODs on channels on twitch when I watch
[4:07:19] <%DaBigVitus> i watch vods but play the youtube vids on mute in the background
[4:07:23] <%tearknack> @WoolieVersus personally, i jsut like the vods cause i get to see your faces as crazy shit happens
[4:07:25] <Darkdrill> is there a way to upload the face cams later
[4:07:26] <andrei11dr> Yea but Pat still has vods on and doesn't seem to have any problems with that, so keep in mind that this would make you look more bad than you thought it would
[4:07:29] <Zayasu> my problem was when i watch a stream and have to leave i cant watch the next session without vods if youtube didnt catch up.
[4:07:30] <%Spydurman> sub lock is the norm, feel free man
[4:07:30] <%zenith0111> Never heard of Sub Vods until today
[4:07:31] <+Zenryoku21> what does live viewership do for you in comparison?
[4:07:32] <supercjk333> is the next stream tomorrow
[4:07:32] <+tymetak> Do the youtube vids have the player camera though?
[4:07:35] <%ChoculaUltra> so anyways, STAN WOOLIE
[4:07:35] <%Superbro64> @thesw1tch sure, but he did already address this
[4:07:36] <%Fujiwara_92> upload it to YouTube somehow
[4:07:44] <+itsOnyxLeo> Just start adding these types of Stream portions as extras on YouTube, like "Dokapon Episode 50.1." This is the first stream I've caught and I'm disappointed I missed out on these cool chat segments
[4:07:44] <%DaBigVitus> pats stream is more successful tho
[4:07:48] <%dark_fire_fly> I watch both here Youtube, and sub. Kreygasm
[4:07:49] <+C0rdak> Could you at least upload the stream version? Your reactions make it better
[4:07:50] <Frostydough1> @zenith0111 Thats how the podcast has always been also
[4:07:53] <%Livelinne> I rewatch the anime in background noise
[4:07:58] <+bizzer10> if you make them for subs then the people who really want them can get them. isnt that the best of both worlds?
[4:08:00] <%Pinkiefan> I'm fine with subs only vods
[4:08:01] <%jiggy_snipe> why isn't a 2nd youtube channel for vods not a good idea?
[4:08:07] <%Javaa01> @zenith0111 The Podcast VoDs are Sub Locked, they've been so since the start of the live podcasts
[4:08:14] <+brave_the_earth> brave_the_earth subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[4:08:16] <+thesw1tch> @superbro64 all that matters is if woolie or reggie are cool with it, which they are so it really dont matter
[4:08:16] <InXplotch> I think the different between pat and woolie is that pat's primary revenue source is his twitch itself.
[4:08:21] <gastherobots> WoolieVS: The Full Versus
[4:08:27] <+greatmonorail> Pats VODs and Woolies VODs are under completely different circumstances
[4:08:31] <%zenith0111> @javaa01 Never bothered looking at VODs
[4:08:33] <zecaptain_james> so im late did it end?
[4:08:34] <%tearknack> everyone watching live helps the stream grow
[4:08:39] <%paladinstarbuster> yeah
[4:08:39] <ExileNineteen> what if your presence is a net negative to the community, like mine
[4:08:39] <%tearknack> vod watchers do nothings
[4:08:41] <+Dr_DangerPhD> live engagement is important
[4:08:42] <InXplotch> throwing his vods on youtube dont really change as much for him
[4:08:46] <%jiggy_snipe> view count is important too
[4:08:49] <%paladinstarbuster> itover
[4:08:52] <ashtray_breathman> who won
[4:08:53] <%zenith0111> I never watch VODs
[4:08:54] <+Zenryoku21> @WoolieVersus Appreciate the genuine answers guys
[4:08:56] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:08:56] <%ChoculaUltra> yes, Pat has pretty much moved on from Youtube after SBFP. His channel is strictly for VoD reuploads and even then he doesn't really care about the monetization behind them since most of his revenue is from streaming nowadays
[4:08:56] <%jiggy_snipe> live views i mean
[4:08:56] <%Amaideus> No one
[4:08:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> Upload unedited streams to their own channel, ala what Pat does?
[4:08:57] <T_Sasquatch> Basically give woolie better avenues for MONEY. Simple. To be fair waiting for an upload isn't fun
[4:09:01] <%paladinstarbuster> not over over
[4:09:03] <%Javaa01> Yeah, live viewer counts drive visibility on Twitch as a whole
[4:09:04] <%tearknack> @zenith0111 tons of people do that. the vods for the CSB (and SBFC before it) are subscriber locked
[4:09:05] <%Fujiwara_92> yeah, woolie and Pat's channels aren't comparable imo
[4:09:06] <%gunsrlove> Commit to stream or commit to YouTube LPs, can't do both fully, yet
[4:09:06] <%Ashenik1> what about just watchers of stream
[4:09:06] <Mattxii> is woolz still in heck
[4:09:09] <golfclubabby> well less people will watch live if they can't catch up
[4:09:12] <%Picia000123> I always watch VODs but I get it
[4:09:19] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @WoolieVersus Can we get an unedited playlist on YT?
[4:09:20] <JetpackMcQuack> Help woolie make money
[4:09:20] <+andyfutrell> because I thought them getting salty was just them playing characters I now realize it was not just an act they are being serious which is stupid @zenith0111
[4:09:21] <andrei11dr> @jiggy_snipe Well, more videos mean more views, also you'd be surprised how many people don't want to watch 4 hours videos
[4:09:25] <%TimetodiveLTX> they are not the same......
[4:09:26] <%ChoculaUltra> @golfclubabby very very apt point
[4:09:28] <Darkdrill> will you 🗿 add face cam on YouTube please
[4:09:28] <%LeaIsChill> YouTube continues to be the worse platform
[4:09:31] <suitangi021> Does running youtube playlist in the background help you?
[4:09:33] <+Zenryoku21> I've always been behind so this is really my first time being able to engage
[4:09:33] <%DaBigVitus> don't lock it now before the final stream session
[4:09:36] <%zenith0111> @tearknack That's nice. Why are you telling me?
[4:09:39] <%jiggy_snipe> yea remember these streams are just live recordings for youtube
[4:09:43] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[4:09:44] <%Solidnick18> youtube moved comments and it's garbage
[4:09:46] <%paladinstarbuster> Ha

[4:09:50] <%jiggy_snipe> was that Kim Possible>
[4:09:52] <CookieDoughFK> Twitch = side hoe?
[4:09:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> THe biggest reason I watch VODS is for Face-Cam and this part, if this part was on YouTube, whether as its own channel would be great.
[4:09:53] <%Ashenik1> KIM?!
[4:09:54] <%Daba_mk2> just start WoolieVS onlyfans account LUL

[4:10:00] <%Amaideus> That's power rangers
[4:10:01] <InXplotch> so what's the situation exactly? you want to sub lock the vods so people go to the youtube?
[4:10:02] <%Lion_kun> That was power rangers you plebes
[4:10:03] <berasite> It would be a shame to lose the VOD's since the chat is what does it for me

[4:13:20] <%Amaideus> I would never have the balls to admit to which artists I look at
[4:13:21] <+itsOnyxLeo> @WoolieVersus can you add these chat segments to the end of play sessions when they pertain to the game?
[4:13:21] <%wolfofsound> Dear woolie, can we get a shadman art review? Thanks
[4:13:25] <%derap41> Alfie has SNEK!!
[4:13:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> @tearknack Wait, Goblin incase?
[4:13:31] <%kekkerscrew> All Art takes inpiration. That's what Art School is for
[4:13:33] <%tearknack> @CommanderSqueaks yes, that incase

[4:13:34] <andrei11dr> It's weird too me that us Europeans get so much more shit than Canadians do,like America is right fucking there, you'd think they'll give their shit to you

[4:13:37] <%paladinstarbuster> yes goblin incase
[4:13:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> @tearknack That's a good incase.
[4:13:42] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> one day i hope to be as good as John K Peta Kappa
[4:13:42] <%SuperKirby24> @wolfofsound cmonBruh
[4:13:45] <arkv01> use references: shindol
[4:13:50] <%perfectsalami> high level trolls from the donaters, but it looks likes its going over their heads
[4:13:52] <%Amaideus> @andrei11dr Nah, they're like our cousins
[4:13:57] <Shishi1205> Difference copy vs tracing
[4:13:57] <%Amaideus> You guys are like
[4:13:59] <jsavarin> Most artists still use reference
[4:14:00] <%Daba_mk2> imitate what you like and eventually you will develop your own artstyle
[4:14:02] <+generalve> art style
[4:14:03] <%Amaideus> That guy in the same classroom at shcool
[4:14:03] <%wolfofsound> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli Kreygasm @SuperKirby24 monkaS
[4:14:04] <RurouniGeo> Innovate don't copy word for word
[4:14:05] <%TimetodiveLTX> all art is theft, don't get caught
[4:14:10] <+generalve> EYE FOR EXAMPLE
[4:14:11] <%jiggy_snipe> l;ol
[4:14:11] <%Daba_mk2> tracing is fine for learning
[4:14:12] <%C4m3r0n0409> Like all Dragon Ball fans
[4:14:12] <+andyfutrell> I mean I make fun of people who take a game like this serious at all there should be zero percent seriousness in my opinion just having fun @zenith0111
[4:14:16] <%fetrigon> "THAT LOOKS COOL I WANNA DO THAT!" is every artist ever.
[4:14:17] <91m10> deconstruct the art, try to understand how it works and try to apply it on your own
[4:14:18] <%DaBigVitus> but exact copying is good practice no?
[4:14:18] <+itsOnyxLeo> Reference vs tracing. two completely different things
[4:14:18] <%zenith0111> Tracing is trash
[4:14:26] <+itsOnyxLeo> All art is adaptive
[4:14:29] <%Amaideus> The strategy for art is to Jeet Kun Do it and take everythign you like and leave the rest behind
[4:14:37] <%nothuzad> mostly it comes down to shape and line
[4:14:38] <gastherobots> Everyone, no matter what the media, was influenced by what came before. The longer you go the more unique you will become.
[4:14:39] <worldbrand> noodle people
[4:14:40] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> tracing helps a bit but dont rely on it forever
[4:14:43] <%jiggy_snipe> just don't wholesale steal someone's style
[4:14:45] <arkv01> clamp limbs LUL
[4:14:45] <%Fujiwara_92> clamp LUL
[4:14:46] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> establish ur own style
[4:14:50] <%tearknack> @perfectsalami i mean Norasuko is a good friend of the channel who does fanart that gets used as LP covers, i don't think it'd matter even if Woolie did get the reference
[4:14:50] <%zenith0111> @andyfutrell You must hate pro player existence then.
[4:15:03] <%hamahiroyuki> as you progress your craft you're naturally will devollep your own style

[4:16:04] <+andyfutrell> that's different this game requires almost no skill @zenith0111
[4:16:05] <%tearknack> @C4m3r0n0409 the thing about just saying "sword art online style" is that there's distinct artists who work on specific anime, have distinct animation styles, etc
[4:16:09] <%perfectsalami> half of chat dissapears for approximatley 5 minutes while looking up those artists
[4:16:12] <%wolfofsound> like oda said just be original even if it's not great
[4:16:12] <vVAstrAVv> idk eoolie that first punch sounds stupidly fun lol
[4:16:21] <+bizzer10> fake it till you make it. comedians start of sounding like their favorite comedians at first too

[4:16:41] <Darkdrill> Are you thinking about adding the face cam on YouTube ? I personally just love the reactions when something hype happens

[4:16:45] <glass_marcus> Man the MHA Mangaka LOVES hands
[4:16:54] <arkv01> its a vibe
[4:16:56] <%zenith0111> @andyfutrell But that raises the question how serious can you paly at a game that takes no skill?
[4:16:56] <supercjk333> i am sure all the art styles have ben taken
[4:16:57] <vVAstrAVv> save it for a wwfio
[4:16:59] <Mr__Jebus> Don't be Rob Liefeld

[4:17:21] <%wolfofsound> diddles KappaPride
[4:17:26] <%legacy0117> Realistically, the punch ideally needs to land directly on the nose, and subsequently cave inward.
[4:17:29] <andrei11dr> You know you could look at other art then anime...
[4:17:32] <supercjk333> all music has been taken and all art has been done
[4:17:33] <%Amaideus> If skill wasn't a factor Minh wouldn't clearly be the best player on the couch

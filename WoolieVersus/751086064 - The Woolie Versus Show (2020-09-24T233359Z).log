[0:03:25] <SveedeshFeesch420MLG> Kirby Fighters was made for Woolie
[0:03:32] <Darren716> I coulda said Yakuza
[0:03:38] <Super_Voltekka> wen VF Kids
[0:03:40] <SirKeigan> yeyeye
[0:03:48] <yvng_dende> It’s like you’re moving in slow motion?
[0:03:49] <$BallerSwagBro9k> LES GOOOOOOOOOO
[0:03:57] <EvieOverride> Fighters Megamix when
[0:03:58] <Darren716> Man i hope he's playing the Judgment version of VF5
[0:03:59] <capnunderoos> I really hope Kirby Fighters gets some content updates with the rest of the dream friends
[0:04:04] <DSD24> "I don't make allowances for old men!"
[0:04:11] <capnunderoos> I wanna see Woolie do a GIFG for Kirby
[0:04:11] <$BallerSwagBro9k> 21 Bridges Ad BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[0:04:18] <yvng_dende> Virtua Fighter 6 needs to happen or I will send Yu Suzuki and SEGW proper a very strongly worded letter detailing my frustration
[0:04:21] <DSD24> Lion Rafale is my favorite
[0:04:33] <yvng_dende> I just cannot spell tonight
[0:04:37] <Super_Voltekka> As if I'd lose to these bozos
[0:04:42] <iamtheTwitchghost> i just want shenmue 4 to have the VF combat engine at least
[0:04:58] <$Superdandy96> Virtua Fighter? Now that’s name I haven’t heard in a long, long, long time.
[0:05:01] <capnunderoos> You think Shenmue 4 is even happening?
[0:05:04] <yvng_dende> I just want Ryo Hazuki to appear in VF6 and finally tie the universes together
[0:05:06] <$BallerSwagBro9k> 8 Bit Jim Sterling LUL
[0:05:14] <iamtheTwitchghost> it will happen! i have faith
[0:05:15] <yvng_dende> @capnunderoos Yu Suzuki said he’d try to get it made
[0:05:16] <Super_Voltekka> There's gonna be an anime
[0:05:41] <iamtheTwitchghost> i wonder when the anime will be out
[0:05:45] <capnunderoos> I can't wait for the anime to get 2 seasons recreating 1 and 2, and then do a GoFundMe for a 3rd filler season
[0:05:58] <EvieOverride> Anyone Remember Virtua Quest?
[0:06:00] <yvng_dende> I just wanna see Jacky in another game thesph1SUZIsad
[0:06:05] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Shenmue isbthem
[0:06:22] <capnunderoos> @yvng_dende closest we're getting is Mii costumes in smash.
[0:06:26] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Shemue is an absolute garbage series that must die
[0:06:29] <capnunderoos> New VF is never happening
[0:06:29] <Super_Voltekka> Better run home to mama, now!
[0:06:38] <Solidnick18> SourPls
[0:06:43] <DSD24> "That wasn't your best shot!"
[0:06:44] <yvng_dende> unfortunately doodSad
[0:06:51] <DSD24> I hope they play Jacky
[0:06:52] <+fiddilstix> VIRTUA FIGHTER?! never seen this game before
[0:06:53] <capnunderoos> Sega only gives a shit about Sonic, Persona, Puyo, and sometimes SMT
[0:06:54] <yvng_dende> Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
[0:06:59] <+fiddilstix> let's go
[0:07:05] <yvng_dende> Emphasis on the sometimes for SMT
[0:07:17] <yvng_dende> I wonder who’s dick had to get sucked for P4G to get a PC port
[0:07:24] <EvieOverride> I sting like a bee!
[0:07:24] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Under the Sea
[0:07:35] <EvieOverride> Bite like a tiger!
[0:07:44] <DSD24> Pockets
[0:08:18] <yvng_dende> Then again the Sonic movie trailer did feature a lot of SEGA characters, and VF5FS did get a big cameo in Yakuza 6, so I think SEGA is aware of the potential hype behind VF6
[0:08:34] <capnunderoos> Oh I forgot to mention Yakuza
[0:08:36] <yvng_dende> Maybe the market just had to get starved for us to get hungry for more
[0:08:38] <capnunderoos> Sega does care about Yakuza
[0:08:39] <Super_Voltekka> In the time since VF5 came out, we already had 4 or 5 new Tekken games. Let that sink in
[0:08:42] <capnunderoos> It that's it
[0:08:50] <iamtheTwitchghost> @Super_Voltekka fuck
[0:08:51] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:09:07] <capnunderoos> Sega only thinks they have 4 5 franchises
[0:09:09] <Solidnick18> SourPls SourPls
[0:09:12] <capnunderoos> 5*
[0:09:17] <@Commando_Joe> missde5Tid
[0:09:22] <iamtheTwitchghost> tbf those 4/5 are the only ones that make money
[0:09:31] <yvng_dende> They also cross VF into shit like SEGA Racing and all those mobile games
[0:09:45] <capnunderoos> Because they abandon anything if it doesn't instantly make infinite profut
[0:09:49] <Hideow> Yo,anyone knows the name of this beat?
[0:09:51] <yvng_dende> I’m at least glad they’re aware of its existence, that’s better than VF not being mentioned at all
[0:09:59] <iamtheTwitchghost> @capnunderoos yeah it's a shame
[0:10:03] <Solidnick18> atleast they remember to put virtua fighter in yakuza. but i'd like a comeback for this series
[0:10:05] <EvieOverride> Imagine being a member of the Binary Domain fandom.
[0:10:05] <yvng_dende> VF is just cool ma
[0:10:13] <%ChoculaUltra> I just beat 13 Sentinels. My brain is fuck.
[0:10:16] <Super_Voltekka> I'm Sorry 2 wen?
[0:10:18] <iamtheTwitchghost> @EvieOverride OUCH
[0:10:21] <%ChoculaUltra> highly recommended.
[0:10:21] <bbHighvalor> y'all think sega gonna announce virtua fighter 6
[0:10:23] <%FuqBoiSlim> Virtua Fighter? is that like a Dead or Alive spin off or somthing???
[0:10:33] <%FuqBoiSlim> why is there 5 of em?
[0:10:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> yo @WoolieVersus is virtua fighter on 360, ps3, or parsec tonight
[0:10:56] <%Josef_Stryker> YEYEYEYEYEYEYE
[0:10:57] <capnunderoos> I seriously expect SMTV and Nocturne Remastered to not make Persona 5 amounts of infinite money, and they just can all non persona projects from Atlus. Then rename them to something like "Studio P"
[0:10:59] <%RyTYoung> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp

[0:24:49] <+RobocopSanchez> monkaS
[0:24:57] <%bread_assassin> You asked for it folks. Woolie's finally playing Yakuza, Kappa
[0:25:02] <%YakumoYomi> Ah, they're playing VF5 from within Judgement?
[0:25:02] <%CaptainPileDriver> the coward move of avoiding the ps3
[0:25:03] <%ChoculaUltra> "Wanna play Virtua Fighter 5? Here's your Virtua Fighter 5." drops this carcass on your desk.
[0:25:04] <%Axle13j> Thanks Sega
[0:25:09] <President_valentine> play Fighting Vipers instead
[0:25:17] <%RyTYoung> thanks Sega
[0:25:17] <%FuqBoiSlim> tfw the only way to play virtua fighter 5 on ps4 is through the yakuza spin off woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:25:23] <+andrerae> yo wtf i got a copy of VF 5 for $6 for XBOX 360
[0:25:25] <@Commando_Joe> and SEGA Bass Fishing
[0:25:27] <President_valentine> as if Microsoft would do anything with it
[0:25:28] <anarchistPastry> dont forget Hatsune Miku, sega owns her too
[0:25:28] <Darren716> Woolie what are you talking about? The newest VF game, DoA 6 came out like 2 years ago!
[0:25:31] <+jiggy_snipe> they own Atlus too
[0:25:32] <emeraldchaos> Microsoft buying SEGA sounds awful NGL
[0:25:33] <astrophizz> and Persona
[0:25:33] <+texflexrex> and only sonic some of the time
[0:25:34] <Zayasu> microsoft putting atlus games on pc Kreygasm
[0:25:35] <+evbites> @WoolieVersus you can play the arcade mode in the story
[0:25:37] <Shardlab> They also own Total War
[0:25:38] <Dumple_Roe> just don't sell them like sonic fighter
[0:25:40] <Lewisisphat> i literally just bought 13 sentinels
[0:25:44] <+RobocopSanchez> sega coming back with microsoft money like ifcGill ifcGill
[0:25:48] <%gatorafan> They like Puyo Puyo(?)
[0:25:48] <DSD24> 13 Sentinels is real good
[0:25:53] <Shardlab> Which means that sweet sweet Warhammer money
[0:26:00] <SomersaultJustice> akira pai jackie sarah
[0:26:04] <%Irridium> Akira, Pai, Jackie, and Sarah
[0:26:05] <DSD24> Akira Sarah, Pai, Jacky
[0:26:09] <Marc_The_Frog > woolieONEGUY_SQ

[0:26:11] <deafmelone> Akira,Pai,Sarah,Jacky
[0:26:18] <%Irridium> literally just used the same voice files as well
[0:26:26] <SomersaultJustice> pick Kazumi Kappa
[0:26:32] <+Pookiedaexzile> DOA is a spirital sucessor
[0:26:33] <+jiggy_snipe> Pat is crying right now
[0:26:34] <+Pookiedaexzile> and improvement
[0:26:38] <DSD24> Kokoro uses the same style as Akira
[0:26:44] <%exaltedma> exaltedma subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[0:26:49] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Its almost like FG are not worth making Kappa Kappa Kappa
[0:26:49] <+Sleepy_Puma> Man I would love for their to be another virtua fighter, I got in with tekken 7
[0:26:49] <MichaelDood> doodken
[0:26:51] <DSD24> Bitch I'm WILD
[0:26:55] <Solidnick18> this is how we do it

[0:27:05] <MichaelDood> doodKen
[0:27:06] <%bread_assassin> Wolf's cool.
[0:27:11] <%nimu290> this is a scuff way to play virtual fighter, Sega way you do this
[0:27:19] <DSD24> El Blaze is rad as fuck
[0:27:25] <+Dova573> Jackie is rad
[0:27:28] <+evbites> Wolf is the absolute worst thing ever
[0:27:40] <%RyTYoung> I had a Virtua Fighter on the Dreamcast back in the day
[0:27:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> so, anyone got a ps3 that wants to play this online
[0:27:48] <Solidnick18> i used jeffery but i don't know nothing
[0:27:49] <+evbites> jean aka Vante is my favorite
[0:28:04] <deafmelone> I play Goh and im learning Akira
[0:28:09] <+Pookiedaexzile> Cuse me?

[0:29:08] <MichaelDood> lol
[0:29:09] <$BallerSwagBro9k> THE ONLY WAY TO PLAY
[0:29:12] <+Pookiedaexzile> This is Fighting games
[0:29:16] <MichaelDood> Woolie's on top of this shit LUL
[0:29:21] <Darren716> To think this isnt even the top 5 most ghetto set ups i've seen on gitfg
[0:29:22] <BurningSaph> Real poverty shit going on
[0:29:22] <%FuqBoiSlim> does woolie not have a ps3 or 360 or something?
[0:29:23] <+RobocopSanchez> what fuck
[0:29:23] <%Axle13j> NotLikeThis
[0:29:25] <%ChoculaUltra> LUL
[0:29:31] <%RyTYoung> LUL
[0:29:37] <%nimu290> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:29:37] <%gatorafan> T-Thanks S-SEGA! BibleThump
[0:29:38] <+jiggy_snipe> is this true poverty?
[0:29:38] <deafmelone> Also Ps3 exists as well tbh
[0:29:38] <Mr_Strut> Isn't this what emulators are for?
[0:30:01] <%ChoculaUltra> imagine having sympathy for Pat? in 2020?
[0:30:01] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1308260203280949248?s=20
[0:30:03] <%ChoculaUltra> Couldn't be me.
[0:30:10] <MichaelDood> psaFist
[0:30:10] <Darren716> It is out
[0:30:15] <+jiggy_snipe> idk how well it works on the ps3 emulator
[0:30:17] <iamtheTwitchghost> @WoolieVersus you could also set up VF4 on ps2 emulation so people could play on parsec
[0:30:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> yeah, the fans plug in the old consoles and play on those
[0:30:21] <kikoeru_san> I'm stunned Pat ain't in on this
[0:30:21] <tearfuldevil> 45 second rounffs?
[0:30:24] <Darren716> And it comes witha free action rpg
[0:30:27] <tearfuldevil> seems pretty short
[0:30:27] <Hideow> Sega doesn't like money
[0:30:29] <OkamiDude15> its out for everyone though. you just need a copy of yakuza to play it
[0:30:37] <%ChoculaUltra> I think Pat's in the middle of murdering people rn
[0:30:41] <Mr_Strut> Nut punch
[0:30:41] <Shardlab> Sega is scared of money
[0:30:42] <EvieOverride> TFW the Super Fighter fandom is treated with more respect than VF
[0:30:47] <fernandapsdois> why is the announcer so distorted
[0:30:57] <%nimu290> woolie versus delivering the scuff goods
[0:30:58] <OkamiDude15> stylistic choice i think
[0:30:58] <kikoeru_san> that or he's getting killed
[0:31:01] <lbrownthedestroyer> God i wish i had this game so i beat you right now !
[0:31:04] <%ChoculaUltra> LUL the announcer really does sound like a deep fried meme
[0:31:13] <%FuqBoiSlim> Sega is too preoccupied with their pachinko parlors and yakuza funbucks to give a damn about virtua fighter NotLikeThis
[0:31:15] <%CaptainPileDriver> again, anyone got this on ps3 and wanna play tonight
[0:31:23] <DSD24> No cool costumes either
[0:31:41] <Leafboi125> The announcer sounding crispy
[0:31:51] <SableS139a> Being a Sega fan is suffering... bluto2Sad
[0:31:55] <+Pookiedaexzile> Never forget, this is a game in a game
[0:32:01] <Mr_Strut> Johns Madden
[0:32:03] <+Pookiedaexzile> We livin
[0:32:07] <deafmelone> i do have this on ps3 but my contollers are jank
[0:32:09] <+Itselguapo> I done handcuffed lightning!
[0:32:12] <AlasterAngelo> being a Sega fan is great if you mainly like Yakuza
[0:32:22] <DSD24> Vanessa!
[0:32:23] <AlasterAngelo> Lei Fei my boy
[0:32:30] <DSD24> YEAH LION
[0:32:33] <%CaptainPileDriver> someone play Goh
[0:32:40] <Mr_Strut> Being a Sega fan is great if you are disinterested in 60% of their IPs.
[0:32:41] <nintega010> choose Kenny Mcwild
[0:32:42] <Solidnick18> lion is so bullshit
[0:32:45] <kaine_west> Goh is like cooler dragunov
[0:32:47] <deafmelone> @captainpiledriver yessssss
[0:32:53] <DSD24> You better take me seriously!
[0:32:57] <AlasterAngelo> Lions voice is so terrible I love it
[0:33:00] <lbrownthedestroyer> Well Yu Sazuki has already made a new shenume, new panzer dragoon, and new nights with balan wonderland so .. maybe yu and square can get back into fighting games
[0:33:03] <%CaptainPileDriver> i need to see Goh tonight, he's the best
[0:33:11] <SableS139a> @AlasterAngelo That and Sonic. I grew up with the Blue Blur like many others, but so many other titles drew me in almost as much. NiGHTS, Panzer Dragoon, Fantasy Zone. There's so much that Sega doesn't give us.
[0:33:20] <%CaptainPileDriver> DO IT REGGIE, DO THE SOMERSAULT TO RULE THE WORLD
[0:33:25] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:33:26] <DSD24> Oh wow Reggie
[0:33:28] <Solidnick18> heyyyyy
[0:33:35] <%FuqBoiSlim> Ecco the Dolphin 3 when??
[0:33:37] <+Pookiedaexzile> That kid is just Christie from Doa
[0:33:48] <Man_in_the_Red> when's Ristar 2
[0:33:52] <DSD24> Low punch
[0:33:56] <%gatorafan> This is the Yakuza LP guys Kappa
[0:33:57] <SableS139a> Doesn't help that Sega of America doesn't seem to have much power to do anything & Sega of Japan takes precedent (even though Sega got its start in the US).
[0:34:01] <%nimu290> liking Sega games is pain this even includes sonic
[0:34:24] <SableS139a> @nimu290 That's a mood n' a half, my guy.
[0:34:36] <Man_in_the_Red> if you like Phantasy star, Yakuza, and Sakura wars you'll eat
[0:34:44] <Super_Voltekka> People complained when Sakurai said Ridley was too big for Smash, but I never heard any mfers complain when Sega did the exact same thing with Taka-Arashi's absence from VF4
[0:34:44] <Man_in_the_Red> the rest starve
[0:34:46] <lbrownthedestroyer> @Man_in_the_Red Ristar 2 is going to be released on the dreamcasst 2 along side Vectorman 3 and the new golden axe
[0:34:59] <%nimu290> yeah man sonic is my favorite too
[0:35:01] <%gatorafan> @man_in_the_red, I love PSO2, but some people are still pretty hungry because it's not "classic" PS
[0:35:05] <+Pookiedaexzile> Wheres the side step game
[0:35:10] <SableS139a> I don't think I'd be able to get into Sakura Wars, tbh. Never really been an RPG or strategy game type of guy.
[0:35:12] <AlasterAngelo> you guys remember Fighting Vipers
[0:35:18] <SableS139a> @AlasterAngelo MY MAN!
[0:35:20] <Solidnick18> Jacky pls
[0:35:21] <%CaptainPileDriver> where the FLIPS REGGIE
[0:35:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> HE'S A FLIPPING GOD
[0:35:26] <DSD24> El Blaze!
[0:35:29] <lazerscraper> NOW
[0:35:30] <Man_in_the_Red> @sables139a good, its primarily a dating sim Kappa
[0:35:32] <Solidnick18> yeah i said cage ok
[0:35:33] <DSD24> I got the advantage!
[0:35:33] <Super_Voltekka> Cage Maroo
[0:35:36] <AlasterAngelo> @sables139a pretty good
[0:35:37] <DSD24> You got nothing!
[0:35:38] <deafmelone> NOW
[0:35:40] <Man_in_the_Red> just like Persona 4-5
[0:35:41] <lazerscraper> HOT DOG
[0:35:44] <Solidnick18> El blaze
[0:36:00] <+Itselguapo> El Blaze was great
[0:36:06] <Solidnick18> let's go not rey mysterio
[0:36:10] <%FuqBoiSlim> no one even remember samba de amigo. including me
[0:36:16] <KohryuZX> please tell me they are playing it off of yakuza lmao
[0:36:18] <nintega010> This is where capcom got El fureta
[0:36:20] <+Itselguapo> MUCHA LUCHA! MUCHA LUCH!
[0:36:24] <+Pookiedaexzile> Ive never Seen EL Blaze on the ground this long
[0:36:25] <Solidnick18> lucha is such a fun style
[0:36:29] <iamtheTwitchghost> DICK PUNCH
[0:36:30] <+Pookiedaexzile> Ive only ever see the combo vids
[0:36:33] <+Itselguapo> (It's a way of life!) MUCHA LUCHA! MUCHA LUCHA!
[0:36:33] <deafmelone> El Blaze, one of the sickest luchadors in fighting games, but his voice tho...
[0:36:35] <%ChoculaUltra> Yep, it’s the Judgment “port” LUL
[0:36:36] <SableS139a> @Man_in_the_Red Didn't Sakura Wars help bring the genre further into the limelight. I'm not sure how popular VNs & dating sims were in 90s Japan outside of the doujin scene.
[0:36:43] <Man_in_the_Red> @kohryuzx they arent, theyre playing it through Judge Eyes Kappa
[0:36:55] <Super_Voltekka> The English voice acting in VF is so cringe. Most of the Westerners don't even have the right accent
[0:36:59] <+Itselguapo> El Blaze was so sick you can do off the cage moves with him it was sick
[0:37:01] <KohryuZX> same universe still counts lmao
[0:37:07] <AlasterAngelo> are they really playing this through Judgement
[0:37:07] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:37:13] <DSD24> I love El Blaze's neutral stance
[0:37:16] <%FuqBoiSlim> @alasterangelo Yes
[0:37:17] <lazerscraper> id rather take vf voices than house of the dead voices
[0:37:19] <Solidnick18> yagami is really going hard on this game
[0:37:23] <tearfuldevil> @AlasterAngelo how else do you play the game Kappa
[0:37:24] <AlasterAngelo> hahahahaha

[0:39:15] <Bennett_Fracture> what's your opinion reggie...
[0:39:15] <%FuqBoiSlim> The VA is cringe but its a special kind of cringe that you'd only get from anime dubs from the 90s and 2000s
[0:39:17] <deafmelone> Vanessa is sick but she looked better vf4
[0:39:18] <Aussie_Manny> Oh, she's the Boss.
[0:39:23] <%ekodrop> ...this game...

[0:48:49] <nintega010> Jacky yeah
[0:48:54] <%Irridium> sega could literally just add in some basic menus and online and release this standalone yet they continue to just not. it hurts.

[0:49:57] <%FuqBoiSlim> So thats who all the SFM artist would call Samus when they didnt have a model for her
[0:49:58] <%MonsieurHonHon> the king fu girl was strong the combos did themselves
[0:49:59] <SableS139a> @jinking79 @paladinstarbuster LUL

[0:51:13] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:51:17] <MichaelOfCainhurst> Why does Brad look like discount Kiryu?
[0:51:19] <huskarl_zap> is that brad pitt from fight club
[0:51:23] <SableS139a> It's insane to see just how well VF5 holds up visually. You can still tell what gen the game's from, but damn if it don't look good.
[0:51:34] <Aussie_Manny> "I'm so GOOD!"
[0:51:36] <%MonsieurHonHon> VF is discount fighting game is why\
[0:51:48] <%Axle13j> the flip!
[0:52:06] <%Irridium> "Excitement and invigoration are offered to all men"

[0:52:30] <DSD24> The boy
[0:52:32] <%MonsieurHonHon> That blank face lmao
[0:52:34] <nintega010> Yeah
[0:52:40] <lazerscraper> goh is brutal
[0:52:40] <Aussie_Manny> A jombie?
[0:52:45] <Solidnick18> jacky time
[0:52:47] <re0killer> why are you playing this @woolieversus larxaVVUT
[0:52:51] <SableS139a> SourPls
[0:52:56] <Broand> Who says martial arts are dead?
[0:52:58] <%jinking79> how many ppl here remember the damn Anime
[0:53:04] <deafmelone> Judo Assassin
[0:53:10] <%Axle13j> LOL
[0:53:11] <townzzzzz> noice
[0:53:12] <seydaq> judo iori
[0:53:12] <+Dova573> The SICKEST
[0:53:13] <DSD24> That was in DOA 5 too
[0:53:14] <%MonsieurHonHon> ZAMBOOBLED
[0:53:17] <Aussie_Manny> C-C-C-COUNTER
[0:53:19] <SableS139a> @jinking79 I still watch it every once in a while. Shit's always been a fun watch
[0:53:32] <%MonsieurHonHon> Uchi mata
[0:53:36] <%MonsieurHonHon> lets fucking go
[0:53:52] <SableS139a> Still sucks that Season 2 never got dubbed, though. It's pretty decent if we're going by 90s anime standards.
[0:53:59] <mighty_fine_trousers> ground grabs?
[0:54:06] <Solidnick18> YEAH!
[0:54:28] <deafmelone> I really wanna see some clinch grabs but I'll be fine
[0:54:31] <SableS139a> Jacky will forever be the main.
[0:54:51] <+paladinstarbuster> Question: why do people who play fighting games online never look at movelists but instead opt to to just lose without knowing anything
[0:55:01] <%MonsieurHonHon> Learning takes effort
[0:55:05] <SableS139a> ^
[0:55:16] <DSD24> Also just look at movelists won't help if you don't practice
[0:55:16] <tearfuldevil> learning on the fly can be fun
[0:55:20] <%MonsieurHonHon> Also it can be boring to learn when you dont have a partner
[0:55:21] <+PJSmooth> This version of the game doesn't have them to be fair
[0:55:35] <%Axle13j> Nice duck
[0:55:38] <SableS139a> Also a lot of time, energy, & patience that a lot of folks don't have.
[0:55:48] <%MonsieurHonHon> Uchi mata!
[0:56:06] <+Dova573> Im sad woolie has not done a single flashkick
[0:56:16] <Aussie_Manny> I got no time for YOU
[0:56:17] <%MonsieurHonHon> The special moves in this game are weird man
[0:56:23] <seydaq> winner benimaru k'
[0:56:25] <%FuqBoiSlim> yOU!
[0:56:26] <+paladinstarbuster> @PJSmooth that makes more sense
[0:56:29] <Aussie_Manny> Oh there's Akira
[0:56:31] <SuddenDeath> 7k
[0:56:32] <iamtheTwitchghost> isn't it upback?
[0:56:33] <+PJSmooth> It's up back
[0:56:33] <mighty_fine_trousers> did they pick Akira yet?
[0:56:36] <deafmelone> upback
[0:56:40] <%ChrisAlgoo> Akira from the Dead or Alive series
[0:56:46] <Aussie_Manny> Akira, the Ryu of the franchise.
[0:56:49] <%FuqBoiSlim> Akira? isn't he from the Degenki Bunko fighting game?
[0:56:54] <%MonsieurHonHon> El blaze is such a janky character
[0:57:00] <iamtheTwitchghost> Ryo Hazuki PogChamp
[0:57:02] <%MonsieurHonHon> Hes got weird moves
[0:57:03] <%Irridium> Nah Akira's that one smash trophy.
[0:57:08] <tearfuldevil> akira, that smash summon
[0:57:09] <masterfire23> remember when jacky and akari were in sonic and Sega all stars racinf
[0:57:11] <%ekodrop> ugh
[0:57:18] <SuddenDeath> just hold PKG
[0:57:22] <SableS139a> @FuqBoiSlim Hardest character to play & master from VF made into one of the easiest fighters to play in DBFC.
[0:57:26] <%MonsieurHonHon> Yea she does Aikido
[0:57:43] <kaine_west> akira doesn't do karate kemonoHomer
[0:57:48] <kaine_west> he does Bajiquan
[0:57:55] <%FuqBoiSlim> FAKE FAN
[0:58:06] <BlackermanZX> local karate man decks a woman in the face
[0:58:07] <+PJSmooth> Just one testuzanko is all I ask
[0:58:09] <deafmelone> Karate Man that Does Kung Fu
[0:58:13] <SableS139a> Aoi's moveset was also given to a Virtua Cop guest fighter in Fighters Megamix to test out how Aoi would translate for VF3.

[0:58:35] <tearfuldevil> bold of you to assume woolie knows irl martial arts stances

[0:59:07] <Aussie_Manny> woolie a boxing boii
[0:59:08] <seydaq> @BlackermanZX woman proceeds to beet karate man
[0:59:30] <SableS139a> Shit, watching VF in action makes me want to get back into martial arts, but the only instructor worth their shit even remotely near me retired about a decade ago.
[0:59:38] <SableS139a> >feelsweaklingman
[0:59:53] <DarknessD42> Aoi > Asuka
[1:00:02] <mighty_fine_trousers> wait they know Akira can counter too right?
[1:00:06] <%MonsieurHonHon> Yea getting an instructor can be rough, I did 2 year of jeet kune do before my teacher went back to uni
[1:00:06] <stormhawk9891> Not even one tetsuzanko, I'm dissappointed

[1:01:39] <%Irridium> @brunoberserk Judgement version LUL

[1:02:00] <SableS139a> Learned & practiced karate back when I was still in elementary. Unfortunately, I didn't even get to brown belt before he retired & I moved.
[1:02:04] <stormhawk9891> Man sumo characters are so fucking lame
[1:02:07] <%FuqBoiSlim> @iamthetwitchghost 🤝

[1:02:37] <%FuqBoiSlim> @squdnate it doesn't sadly so its just for fun tonight
[1:02:47] <SableS139a> If I could learn martial arts again from an instructor worth their shit, I probably would. Always felt good to learn and put everything into practice.
[1:02:47] <%MonsieurHonHon> If they made a new VF I might buy it, I really had fun with VF5
[1:02:51] <%MonsieurHonHon> The little I played anyways
[1:02:59] <SableS139a> Martial arts is also cathartic as shit.
[1:03:00] <seydaq> psycho soldier vs e honda. got it
[1:03:06] <%FuqBoiSlim> DQ
[1:03:20] <%Irridium> they could literally just take this, put some basic menus and online functionality into it, and release it standalone. Sega pls
[1:03:28] <SableS139a> I'd be down to see a VF6. Or hell, even a new Fighters Megamix
[1:03:37] <MichaelOfCainhurst> LUL
[1:03:48] <%MonsieurHonHon> Well Sega has been porting a lot of shit to PC recently, maybe theyll port this too
[1:03:56] <SableS139a> Anything to give me the Fighting Vipers roster again. Still need to nab the manga at some point.
[1:04:11] <Man_in_the_Red> they'd port it if they remember it existed
[1:04:12] <%Irridium> @MonsieurHonHon it technically already is since it's in the PC versions of Yakuza.
[1:04:45] <%MonsieurHonHon> tru
[1:04:46] <brunoberserk> @SableS139a wait , exist a fighting vipers MANGA ?
[1:04:56] <%MonsieurHonHon> Striking vipers manga when

[1:13:40] <+Itselguapo> AWWW YEEEEEEEAGHHH!
[1:13:46] <@Squdnate> This game looked next gen asf back in 2006
[1:13:56] <%jetjagger222> lau's good stuff is in his P+K moves
[1:13:58] <Solidnick18> let's go sarah
[1:13:59] <+Itselguapo> This looks like a ps4 game yea like early ps4
[1:14:00] <@Squdnate> The animation and model quality
[1:14:02] <+GalacticaPhanto> man Sarah was one of my OG fgc crushes as a kid
[1:14:06] <MichaelOfCainhurst> That Sarah costume is making me feel things...
[1:14:11] <black_pariah> i really like sarah, her and jacky are the only vf characters i have any connection to
[1:14:14] <%Irridium> I mean I have seen worse looking PS4 games than this
[1:14:19] <%jetjagger222> woolieSHOOK
[1:14:23] <@Menitta> for 08, the character models are really good
[1:14:27] <Solidnick18> more old man
[1:14:29] <+Itselguapo> Yo play as my boy Brad though
[1:14:30] <@Menitta> oh wait 06
[1:14:31] <@Menitta> fuck
[1:14:33] <SableS139a> @GalacticaPhanto When it came to AM2 chicks, it was Honey in my case. Basic bitch choice, I know, but still...
[1:14:34] <%FuqBoiSlim> yeah, street fighter 4 looks way worse than this
[1:14:35] <%jetjagger222> member when lau was straight up just taopaipai
[1:14:38] <@Squdnate> It still looks super good
[1:14:45] <stormhawk9891> Hey best song in the game
[1:14:58] <SableS139a> SOURPLS
[1:15:00] <%Irridium> actually shocked how good this stage looks
[1:15:04] <@Squdnate> The bitcrushed audio is charming in a way
[1:15:13] <%jetjagger222> is there a way to play ride the tiger on this
[1:15:14] <@Menitta> The hottest shit in fighting games are now minigames in other games
[1:15:23] <%jetjagger222> i know its in the arcade ver
[1:15:27] <neroblind88> monkaS those grab ducks
[1:15:29] <SableS139a> VF5's soundtrack can slap me any day of the fucking week. Oh my lord... Kreygasm
[1:15:37] <+Itselguapo> I fucking miss this game I wish that Sega would be like, "We making Virtua Fighter 6
[1:15:49] <%Irridium> @Menitta they could literally just add in basic menus and online and release it standalone. They just... don't.
[1:15:54] <neroblind88> id rather have a real port of 5
[1:15:55] <%FuqBoiSlim> they had to sacrifice audio quality to make it look good?
[1:16:01] <+PJSmooth> @jetjagger222 The console version has it for sure, but the judgement version does not
[1:16:16] <@Squdnate> I cant remember why the audio is bitcrushed like that.
[1:16:27] <@Squdnate> cuz its also that in arcade
[1:16:29] <%jetjagger222> they still have a bunch of machines running VF5 in one of the sega arcades in akihabara last year
[1:16:49] <%FuqBoiSlim> the only way we get vf6 is if some fans make a fangame, sega sees it and decides to hire them and make them do all the work of making it
[1:17:02] <deafmelone> some of these voice are from vf3 all the way the dreamcast
[1:17:13] <+GalacticaPhanto> @jetjagger222 I mean the VF scene is weirdly strong, so it makes sense
[1:17:28] <+GalacticaPhanto> VANESSA
[1:17:33] <%jetjagger222> @GalacticaPhanto unfortunately just in japan
[1:17:37] <@Squdnate> Yea, but VF3's audio wasnt this crunched lul
[1:17:40] <%WhereIsWill> but vanessa tho! Kreygasm
[1:17:44] <SableS139a> @FuqBoiSlim Sega of America would probably be down for that. Hell, they've loved Sonic Smackdown so far. It just comes down to Sega of Japan at that point since SoA has had very little power to do shit since 93/94.
[1:17:45] <deafmelone> yeah
[1:17:48] <neroblind88> you can make vanessa dark skin in the actual game
[1:18:02] <%jetjagger222> man i hate lion
[1:18:09] <+GalacticaPhanto> @neroblind88 the way God intended
[1:18:10] <wibbwobbler> vanessa bruh
[1:18:13] <DSD24> I love Lion
[1:18:42] <@Squdnate> I love Vanessa, but I have never learned how the fuck she works. The stance command grab stuff makes my head spin
[1:18:47] <SableS139a> Was Vanessa naturally darker in VF4? I never paid much attention b/c VF1 Anniversary held my attention more.
[1:18:54] <%jetjagger222> we want akira action
[1:18:55] <neroblind88> @GalacticaPhanto FeelsGoodMan
[1:18:55] <DSD24> She was darker yes
[1:19:01] <deafmelone> @sables139a yes
[1:19:07] <neroblind88> @SableS139a she was
[1:19:16] <%FuqBoiSlim> @sables139a do you know why SoA has so little say? was it always like that or did they do something that made them lose influence?
[1:19:18] <SableS139a> @deafmelone @DSD24 @neroblind88 Thanks gents
[1:19:21] <deafmelone> also actually had an ass
[1:19:24] <@Squdnate> Her skintone was darker in 4, but not by much
[1:19:24] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:19:34] <%jetjagger222> @deafmelone woolieGASM
[1:19:39] <SuddenDeath> nah, she was HELLA dark in VF4
[1:20:01] <@Squdnate> In the ACTUAL console version, you can get darker skin to her iirc
[1:20:05] <neroblind88> nice !
[1:20:11] <SableS139a> @FuqBoiSlim Sega of Japan wanted VF to do better in arcades and on console since VF1 wasn't doing so hot on release while the Genesis fighting game that SoA worked on was doing super well.
[1:20:15] <neroblind88> lion strats
[1:20:15] <%jetjagger222> you can also make lau resemble master asia

[1:21:24] <stormhawk9891> PENALTY
[1:21:26] <%FuqBoiSlim> @sables139a dang and that's it? i thought it would be the way the sega Saturn got left for dead in the US
[1:21:28] <SableS139a> @FuqBoiSlim So when the next game was being worked on and almost got the greenlight since the past few games did well and there was so much more planned, SoJ canned the project over the phone and told SoA & the Sega Technical Institute to focus more on Virtua Fighter 1.
[1:21:35] <%Axle13j> LUL
[1:21:39] <+hod_fareview> Are they playing Virtua Fighter 5 through Yakuza?
[1:21:44] <@Squdnate> Judgment
[1:21:45] <%Irridium> @hod_fareview judgement but yes
[1:21:51] <Solidnick18> yeah well it's what you use in judgment
[1:22:02] <+Bamcc2> Are they playing in Yakaza 6?
[1:22:10] <SableS139a> @FuqBoiSlim The Virtua Fighter situation was among the earliest incidents that resulted in Sega's US & Japanese divisions butting heads with each other.
[1:22:17] <%FuqBoiSlim> @bamcc2 Judge Eyes
[1:22:24] <%Irridium> Eyes Judge
[1:22:35] <%jetjagger222> @SableS139a didn't eternal champions get nixed because of VF as well

[1:29:48] <%Irridium> Mr. Satan in Dragon Ball Z Budokai has a move that either does all damage or no damage
[1:29:48] <BlackermanZX> daamn
[1:29:49] <%jetjagger222> bonus-kun from waku waku is literally a punching bag dressed like ryu
[1:29:53] <+Itselguapo> Brad the character that makes a masher look fucking cool as fuck
[1:30:06] <neroblind88> brad is very mash friendly
[1:30:13] <@Squdnate> Dan from SF, bosconovitch from Tekken 3 etc

[1:31:24] <Guntanks_in_Space> rearranging your joints

[1:31:26] <%BinaryFireball> breaking limbs and hearts
[1:31:31] <SableS139a> Breaking her crush's limbs.
[1:31:38] <DSD24> AH yeah this stage
[1:31:41] <@Squdnate> I love how Akira is the posterboy of Virtua Fighter
[1:31:48] <@Squdnate> But he's one of the most complex characters
[1:31:54] <SableS139a> As Spike Speigel would say, "I like a woman who can kick my ass."
[1:31:55] <Lophostrix_> didn't this game have like a silver surfer type character?
[1:31:57] <+Itselguapo> Ryu has no friends.... but Akira has all the friends
[1:31:59] <DSD24> Wasn't Dural in this stage?
[1:32:01] <%hologram_sam> that was almost metal tetris?
[1:32:01] <@Squdnate> Its so rich
[1:32:07] <DSD24> @Lophostrix_ That's Dural
[1:32:08] <Guntanks_in_Space> Dural, yeah. the boss character
[1:32:12] <neroblind88> durals stage
[1:32:13] <MichaelOfCainhurst> @SableS139a mood
[1:32:20] <deafmelone> This is Lion's stage

[1:32:26] <%Irridium> god I love Lei-Fei
[1:32:29] <Guntanks_in_Space> needs more akira elbow lol
[1:32:33] <SableS139a> @Squdnate @Itselguapo Yeah. Akira's the complete inverse of Ryu Hoshi, and it works out for the better.
[1:32:34] <%BinaryFireball> yes I think he does think he's smooth
[1:32:35] <Lophostrix_> what a throwback
[1:32:36] <%jetjagger222> well used to
[1:32:36] <%BinaryFireball> AND fancy
[1:32:37] <+SWindleFeD> Wait, Dural is the VF5 boss and not VF4?
[1:32:38] <tiaramaki> "He must be easy to play like Jin... wait, what's with this 'one frame' command?"
[1:32:43] <madogod> my boi akira is getting his ass kick
[1:32:46] <%FuqBoiSlim> LETS SEE THOSE TETSUZANKOS COME ON SwiftRage
[1:32:49] <neroblind88> @SWindleFeD both
[1:32:58] <Guntanks_in_Space> oh yeah we gotta see some SHOULDERS
[1:32:58] <+GalacticaPhanto> @swindlefed I mean you sure about that?
[1:33:00] <deafmelone> You fight Dural in the Colosseum
[1:33:05] <tearfuldevil> have we even seen a SINGLE tetsuzanko?
[1:33:09] <SableS139a> @MichaelOfCainhurst Ahh, I see that you are a man of culture as well... bluto2Smug
[1:33:17] <+SWindleFeD> Yeah sorry, it's been a while since I last played a VF game
[1:33:18] <DSD24> Counter!
[1:33:19] <neroblind88> @deafmelone my mistake
[1:33:39] <deafmelone> @neroblind88 it's all good
[1:33:39] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:33:42] <FrankTheTankOS> are they playing this through yakuza?
[1:33:47] <tearfuldevil> yeah
[1:33:49] <SuddenDeath> 8+PKG
[1:33:49] <neroblind88> wall splat
[1:33:51] <Solidnick18> judgment
[1:33:51] <FrankTheTankOS> lmao
[1:33:51] <tearfuldevil> well, through judge eyes
[1:33:56] <FrankTheTankOS> gotcha
[1:34:15] <+GalacticaPhanto> no Tetsuzanko? no respect lol
[1:34:19] <SableS139a> So how many of you folks remember the VF5 April Fools promo where the game was retooled into a hella fast Street Fighter?
[1:34:22] <neroblind88> #PORTVF5
[1:34:26] <tearfuldevil> but DOA 6 came out like last year Kappa
[1:34:31] <%FuqBoiSlim> no Tetsuzankos? unsubbed
[1:34:34] <deafmelone> @sables139a YES
[1:34:36] <wibbwobbler> underrated 4 sure
[1:34:40] <%BinaryFireball> is that the bug catcher from pokemon???
[1:34:40] <BlackermanZX> Sega: Virtual Fighter WHO?!
[1:34:45] <Man_in_the_Red> except Puyo Puyo tetris has another sequel
[1:34:50] <DSD24> Man look at the puddles
[1:34:51] <neroblind88> lion is supposed to be french LUL
[1:34:53] <%FuqBoiSlim> Puyo Puyo Tetris 2 just got announced
[1:34:53] <SableS139a> @deafmelone majinoElmo
[1:34:58] <DarthTaco> puyo gets lots of support lol
[1:35:06] <+shadowmoonsama> Yo bring back dark skin Vanessa in VF6
[1:35:13] <%jetjagger222> i love how there are the same sound effects from VF2
[1:35:23] <%FuqBoiSlim> The Puyo brand is BROLIC 💪
[1:35:30] <MichaelOfCainhurst> Sometimes it feels like Sega hates money
[1:35:34] <SableS139a> Puyo as a whole is still going strong, even if a lot of the series has been relegated mainly to Japanese shores like Virtual-On.
[1:35:35] <%Malik1002> Malik1002 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! yooo 5 months feels long but nice to be here with the boys woolie and funk master feet. ggs to all fighting games matches we might have.
[1:35:43] <neroblind88> japan loves 3tb
[1:35:50] <+SWindleFeD> @MichaelOfCainhurst Could say the same of a lot of companies
[1:35:57] <Jonny_Uppercut> Can we talk about how Vanessa Lewis is a very cute woman LuvPeekR
[1:36:01] <%FuqBoiSlim> @michaelofcainhurst no wonder they bought Atlus they got the same mindset LUL
[1:36:07] <+PJSmooth> 3 experimented a lot
[1:36:12] <SableS139a> @Jonny_Uppercut Vanessa a whole S n a c c
[1:36:15] <DSD24> @Jonny_Uppercut She is pretty cute
[1:36:21] <SableS139a> She can kick my ass anytime
[1:36:32] <deafmelone> I like 3's subway stage
[1:36:34] <tearfuldevil> i want to poke vanessa muscles
[1:36:41] <+Itselguapo> Sega be like, "We aren't really sure when we'll release Yakuza Ishin in other countries, we're not sure now is the right time."
[1:36:45] <SableS139a> @tearfuldevil C u l t u r e d
[1:36:46] <Jonny_Uppercut> Tearful gets it
[1:36:52] <neroblind88> nice !
[1:36:58] <%Irridium> god I wish that were me
[1:37:05] <tearfuldevil> although i jsut generally like poking things in general
[1:37:05] <+Itselguapo> The right time will be when Samurai's are over used like Zombies and Sega will be like, "You kids still like Samurais....?"
[1:37:11] <tearfuldevil> its not usually sexual i swear
[1:37:12] <MichaelOfCainhurst> If you look like Vanessa and you need a punching bag, call me.
[1:37:13] <@Squdnate> Chat is in masochism hour I see
[1:37:20] <%jetjagger222> its thirsty thursday
[1:37:22] <madogod> Vanesssa top tier woolie bait?
[1:37:37] <%jetjagger222> erryone thirsty for VF6 though
[1:37:38] <+Fenrein> In a post P4 steam port world, I'm really curious to see where SEGA goes from there regarding ports.
[1:37:38] <tearfuldevil> hair too long to be top tier woolie abit
[1:37:40] <tiaramaki> Vanessa is pretty raw, up on my top five for the series
[1:37:40] <%BinaryFireball> take that bugcatcher!
[1:37:40] <SableS139a> I mean, stronk tomboy is kicking ass in-game and today IS Thursday, so...
[1:37:43] <wibbwobbler> nani??
[1:37:43] <tearfuldevil> but shes pretty strong
[1:37:53] <anarchistPastry> ITS TOMBOY THURSDAY
[1:38:00] <SableS139a> TOMBOYS ARE LIFE
[1:38:03] <+Fenrein> Of course sega will probably just do nothing like usual
[1:38:03] <+Bamcc2> Triple Shin Jab LUL
[1:38:07] <neroblind88> @Hayasage pray to god this is their next port job
[1:38:14] <+Itselguapo> Chad Burns
[1:38:19] <DSD24> YOoooo
[1:38:19] <deafmelone> Apparently Asuka from WWE did Vanessa's Mocap
[1:38:22] <%FuqBoiSlim> chat horny tonight? alright, I want Vanessa to pour water down her abs so I can drink it like a gerbil in their cage
[1:38:23] <DSD24> I love this outfit
[1:38:28] <+Fenrein> There are literally so many things they could port that I'd be fine with
[1:38:30] <DSD24> El Blaze with the hoodie
[1:38:38] <tiaramaki> VF6 along with a Quest Mode a la VF4EVO would be so nice
[1:38:38] <+Fenrein> but they'll probably port none of them
[1:38:40] <anarchistPastry> bruuhhh fuqboi lmao
[1:38:43] <huskarl_zap> HuuuuAHHH
[1:38:52] <Guntanks_in_Space> @tiaramaki that would be really good
[1:38:53] <%hologram_sam> yEEaaasssss
[1:39:07] <SableS139a> @FuqBoiSlim That's... Actually a whole ass mood...
[1:39:14] <tearfuldevil> now im actually thirsty
[1:39:19] <neroblind88> lol
[1:39:20] <@Squdnate> I love Brad. He's so cool in the lame 2000's way.

[1:39:23] <SableS139a> @tearfuldevil KEK
[1:39:32] <%FenixSeraph> I miss Virtua Fighter

[1:40:12] <Guntanks_in_Space> yea Blaze has mist
[1:40:20] <Guntanks_in_Space> and a lot of other silly lucha moves
[1:40:24] <%FuqBoiSlim> this music is kinda SourPls
[1:40:26] <DSD24> God that pose is so good
[1:40:29] <%laserbeaming> is this woolieFUN ?
[1:40:34] <tearfuldevil> it is
[1:40:41] <tearfuldevil> no online either
[1:40:42] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:40:44] <Chaos_Switch> YOOOOOOO
[1:40:45] <%FuqBoiSlim> @laserbeaming it is in fact woolieFUN
[1:40:46] <%Irridium> for fun and thirst
[1:40:51] <tearfuldevil> since they're playing in Judgement LUL
[1:40:54] <SuddenDeath> time to whip out the real gam eon ps3 ?
[1:40:55] <Guntanks_in_Space> no online unless you crack open the Xboner version
[1:40:56] <Chaos_Switch> Let's go ! i love this game
[1:40:59] <tiaramaki> Oh heck yea, mah main!
[1:40:59] <Guntanks_in_Space> and use BC
[1:41:06] <MichaelOfCainhurst> for thirst
[1:41:09] <SableS139a> That's actually a kickass alt
[1:41:09] <%FenixSeraph> it's the French Cujoh too, like Jolyne's is spelled
[1:41:11] <Guntanks_in_Space> or try and see if PS3 still has people around
[1:41:14] <%FuqBoiSlim> what about the dog
[1:41:24] <deafmelone> Jean does actual JoJo poses
[1:41:26] <DSD24> Watch Jean do a slam dunk
[1:41:29] <%Irridium> oh god is Jean from Bayo based very loosely on Jean from Virtua Fighter
[1:41:32] <Chaos_Switch> low punches yeah!
[1:41:39] <SuddenDeath> holy crap this game is mising all the lighting from the ps3/360 ports
[1:41:40] <@Squdnate> Xbone BC, 360 and PS3 (and RPCS3 with parsec on PC) have online functionality with VF5FS
[1:41:41] <%jetjagger222> i miss pai's hat from the old games
[1:41:44] <+deadmandro> doodBro
[1:41:44] <neroblind88> DUNKED
[1:41:46] <Solidnick18> take a dip
[1:41:50] <tearfuldevil> kujo is an actual japanese surname
[1:41:52] <%FuqBoiSlim> @irridium that game is filled to the brim with sega references so maybe
[1:41:58] <Guntanks_in_Space> oh yeah RPCS3 Parsec VF5FS is a thing!
[1:42:01] <@Squdnate> You can use share play with Yakuza 6 version (and prolly this one as well) but its so janky, and the versions are so barebones compared to OG
[1:42:05] <tearfuldevil> so i'm sure there's some other characters with the name
[1:42:06] <+deadmandro> doodLewd doodBro This series is SICk
[1:42:22] <DSD24> Yoooo
[1:42:26] <Solidnick18> oh huh
[1:42:26] <SableS139a> O O O O O H H H
[1:42:30] <neroblind88> PogChamp
[1:42:32] <fIashman92> IMO Eileen will feel the most natural to other FG players. Quarter circle motion cancels, and PKG plus a direction gives you Akuma flips
[1:42:33] <%Irridium> PogChamp
[1:42:42] <Guntanks_in_Space> okay short version: the thing with jean here is that some of his strings can be delayed
[1:42:51] <%jetjagger222> lau is also noob friendly
[1:42:55] <townzzzzz> back heavy
[1:43:01] <Guntanks_in_Space> and you can cancel the delays with the opposite attack (punch cancelled with kicks, kicks cancelled with punches)
[1:43:17] <Guntanks_in_Space> and the charge attacks can do different followups when blocked
[1:43:25] <%jetjagger222> dayum girl
[1:43:28] <tiaramaki> Yeyeyeye
[1:43:59] <fIashman92> 46P as Wolf for easy punish
[1:44:00] <%Reverend_Roscoe> goh is so cool
[1:44:00] <Guntanks_in_Space> Wolf, one of the rare Canadian fighters
[1:44:05] <tiaramaki> Oh this theme is GREAT
[1:44:06] <@Squdnate> There isnt a character in VF that i actively hate. There is at least one or two things with every character that makes me go "That's some neat shit yo"
[1:44:16] <Guntanks_in_Space> Goh is what you get when you want Olympic Judo and Ball Kicking
[1:44:26] <SableS139a> @Squdnate Speaking the truth.
[1:44:27] <%FenixSeraph> Canadian and a native at that
[1:44:34] <%jetjagger222> goh would fit right in kengan ashura
[1:44:34] <fIashman92> I don't likee playing as Goh
[1:44:35] <+deadmandro> This dirt is S+ Tier
[1:44:41] <Guntanks_in_Space> so you have really nice shoulder throws as well as him kicking your kneecaps
[1:44:44] <neroblind88> @jetjagger222 HELL YES
[1:44:53] <%FuqBoiSlim> @jetjagger222 you aint even lying
[1:44:58] <fIashman92> Not seeing enough knees being thrown
[1:44:59] <tearfuldevil> eh, saying "oh yeeah he's a NATIVE canadian" is like
[1:45:00] <SableS139a> It helps that everyone in VF is viable too. Even if the fight's an uphill one, you can come out on top with pretty much anyone.
[1:45:07] <tearfuldevil> lol what tribe is he from
[1:45:11] <Guntanks_in_Space> yea needs more knees
[1:45:15] <Guntanks_in_Space> or arms getting broken
[1:45:28] <deafmelone> more knees indeed
[1:45:29] <+deadmandro> Give me that Arm
[1:45:33] <fIashman92> 6K for knees
[1:45:36] <Guntanks_in_Space> or counter-hit back Kick
[1:45:40] <%jetjagger222> wolf needs more tackles
[1:45:41] <Guntanks_in_Space> 4K into throw lol
[1:45:48] <Guntanks_in_Space> for that niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice and chonky damage
[1:45:54] <+deadmandro> We kneed more knees
[1:45:55] <deafmelone> @guntanks_in_space Kreygasm
[1:46:08] <tearfuldevil> its not negative rep, but its not positive rep because its not actual rep
[1:46:09] <+SWindleFeD> So how is everyone?

[1:56:18] <Guntanks_in_Space> you can like
[1:56:21] <Guntanks_in_Space> slide input
[1:56:21] <%FuqBoiSlim> I dont think plague doesn't care about multiplayer anything except for dark souls invasions
[1:56:25] <Guntanks_in_Space> but that works for VF
[1:56:27] <Guntanks_in_Space> err, DOA5
[1:56:33] <Guntanks_in_Space> not as consistent for VF5FS
[1:56:35] <SuddenDeath> no piano....must be done at the same time
[1:56:36] <%jetjagger222> VF5.5
[1:56:40] <shonuff_kotti_dashogun> u did it again

[1:57:15] <Guntanks_in_Space> it's a REALLY FAST LAUNCHER yes
[1:57:15] <tiaramaki> LUL
[1:57:17] <neroblind88> LOL
[1:57:17] <Solidnick18> LUL
[1:57:19] <SuddenDeath> LOl
[1:57:20] <tearfuldevil> and you did it a punch before
[1:57:24] <SuddenDeath> yes u do
[1:57:25] <%jetjagger222> the japanese hit that on CH and juggle your ass into tetsuzanko
[1:57:30] <tearfuldevil> when you thought you weren't doing it
[1:57:50] <%Irridium> social distance
[1:57:51] <SuddenDeath> you hold K
[1:57:53] <shonuff_kotti_dashogun> you can hold it
[1:57:55] <%laserbeaming> is that like a 12 frame launcher?
[1:58:00] <fIashman92> Just play Lau and press buttons
[1:58:02] <@Squdnate> It's a different move, but the same princip
[1:58:02] <SuddenDeath> you can hold K
[1:58:02] <%Josef_Stryker> Man this stage reminds me alot of Purgatory in Yakuza
[1:58:05] <%jetjagger222> welcome to VF
[1:58:16] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah 3K+G is different!
[1:58:18] <%jetjagger222> EWGF ain't got shit on this
[1:58:23] <%FuqBoiSlim> VF players really are built different shofuWhy
[1:58:25] <SuddenDeath> yes?
[1:58:28] <deafmelone> what about the classic rekka that was his Super in Dengeki Bunko?
[1:58:28] <SuddenDeath> :D
[1:58:31] <Guntanks_in_Space> yea EWGF ain't got shit on Knee
[1:58:36] <SuddenDeath> now u know why i got my name
[1:58:38] <%FuqBoiSlim> @suddendeath YOU?!
[1:58:39] <fIashman92> Akira is the only character like this at least
[1:58:39] <Guntanks_in_Space> but EWGF in itself is DIFFICULT
[1:58:40] <%Josef_Stryker> So how exactly does this game differ from Tekken?
[1:58:44] <SuddenDeath> :D
[1:58:48] <Guntanks_in_Space> especially trying to get many of them consistent
[1:58:49] <tearfuldevil> i felt good about learnign how to do EWGF LUL
[1:58:52] <%jetjagger222> consistent ewgf is the hard part
[1:58:56] <DSD24> Player 1 Privilege
[1:58:57] <%jetjagger222> "on demand"
[1:59:05] <%laserbeaming> Fwuack
[1:59:07] <Guntanks_in_Space> @Josef_Stryker the movement is more fluid for starters, 3 buttons instead of 4
[1:59:09] <tearfuldevil> i can't really do it on demand in a fight
[1:59:13] <giogio346> anyone else notice his mic peaking a lot it wasnt like this before
[1:59:21] <@Squdnate> @Josef_Stryker Tekken is 4 button. This is only 3. Also very different in how mechanics work
[1:59:21] <fIashman92> @Josef_Stryker Tekken is very footsie based. This game is almost 100% infighting
[1:59:23] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah it's kinda peaking a lot
[1:59:24] <tearfuldevil> but i can do it liek, 2/5 times in training mode
[1:59:28] <DSD24> Sarah's theme in Virtua Fighter 2 is great
[1:59:42] <%FuqBoiSlim> this game is making them pop off a lot too tbf
[1:59:44] <Guntanks_in_Space> @tearfuldevil same lol, 2/5 in training, 0/5 in matches (as Jin, so it's EWHF for me)
[1:59:52] <tearfuldevil> and sicne mishimas don't interest me im good
[1:59:59] <%jetjagger222> the pace here is super rapid and matches can turn around in fractions of a second
[1:59:59] <DSD24> History is on my side Reggie
[2:00:04] <%Irridium> I prefer it way more when random doesn't show you who you get until you get into the match
[2:00:08] <tearfuldevil> i was just trying to prove to myself i could
[2:00:10] <%jetjagger222> if akira CH's you it can kill instantly
[2:00:10] <neroblind88> splattt
[2:00:15] <%Irridium> you miss the anticipation
[2:00:16] <%jetjagger222> plus ringouts
[2:00:16] <%MonsieurHonHon> its not really a 3 buton fighter when one of them is block
[2:00:31] <Guntanks_in_Space> also yo this game's got footsies too, just that the movement is really, really different from Tekken
[2:00:33] <Guntanks_in_Space> and i find more fluid
[2:00:46] <%jetjagger222> technically its more because P+G, K+G and P+K are sometimes different buttons
[2:00:48] <tearfuldevil> yeah even just watching it
[2:00:51] <fIashman92> Is it really a 3 button fighter though when PK and KG are basically 2 extra buttons
[2:00:53] <tearfuldevil> its very different
[2:01:03] <tearfuldevil> from tekken i mean
[2:01:09] <eldragon_1> what are they playing this on? Is it Judgement?
[2:01:14] <%Irridium> yes
[2:01:18] <%jetjagger222> err P+G is straight up throw so i dun goofd
[2:01:19] <Guntanks_in_Space> yea apparently it's through Judgement (nut)
[2:01:28] <@Squdnate> Yes. There is punch, kick and guard
[2:01:30] <eldragon_1> thanks
[2:01:30] <@Squdnate> 3 buttons
[2:01:34] <tearfuldevil> although it ddoes have the feeling of peopel playing tekken and not knowing how to combo lol
[2:01:41] <DSD24> YOoooo
[2:01:42] <Admiral_PopnFresh> cowardice
[2:01:43] <tearfuldevil> every tiem they get a launcher i cringe
[2:01:46] <neroblind88> monkaS
[2:01:46] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:01:46] <+jv5_guy> audio crackle
[2:01:50] <tearfuldevil> and i don't even know how to play VF
[2:01:56] <DSD24> Sarah is best
[2:02:00] <%Irridium> reggie just played himself
[2:02:03] <Guntanks_in_Space> also low level VF is hilarious
[2:02:04] <%jetjagger222> juggles are pretty tight compared to tekken
[2:02:07] <neroblind88> that was awesome
[2:02:07] <Guntanks_in_Space> the love for DICK PUNCH
[2:02:19] <%jetjagger222> there isn't always a huge launch and obvious juggle opportunity
[2:02:30] <neroblind88> PLEASE SEGA
[2:02:31] <Guntanks_in_Space> but when the opportunity is there
[2:02:36] <Guntanks_in_Space> HOOOOOOOOOLY SHIT
[2:02:38] <fIashman92> Eileen plays like a normal fighting game character
[2:02:38] <%jetjagger222> yeah
[2:02:39] <Solidnick18> judgment is a great game but yeah
[2:02:42] <@Menitta> Judgment and Yakuza 6 are good games

[2:03:33] <eldragon_1> "Get Into Minigames"

[2:03:45] <@Menitta> Project X Zone and Dengeki Bunko
[2:03:50] <%Malik1002> virtual fighters in side of fucking judgment thats funny on lvls not of this world
[2:03:53] <DSD24> Yagami in the back

[2:03:56] <%jetjagger222> long may it reight
[2:04:00] <%jetjagger222> *reign
[2:04:04] <%FairOnFire> enbRespect
[2:04:04] <fIashman92> I kinda know how to play Puyo, I can coach lol
[2:04:11] <DSD24> But now DOA6 is potentially dead
[2:04:11] <neroblind88> PepeHands
[2:04:24] <%FuqBoiSlim> the spirit is willing but the flesh is nonexistent
[2:04:25] <Guntanks_in_Space> yea DOA6 potentially dead
[2:04:29] <diontmack> hey sega TGS in 9 hours! maybe we'll get virtu- HAHAHAHA
[2:04:34] <%jetjagger222> wha happun to doa6?
[2:04:46] <@Menitta> they do if its on BC
[2:04:48] <huskarl_zap> IT fucking glop
[2:04:48] <fIashman92> Final Showdown was Digital only
[2:04:51] <%Irridium> it is digital on xbox yeah
[2:04:51] <@Squdnate> It is available digitally on Xbone
[2:04:55] <%FairOnFire> digital only
[2:04:55] <Guntanks_in_Space> oh yeah if you catch say, one Sabin/Yung Art, from time to time he re-streams VF5FS japan stuiff
[2:04:55] <+beatsinmyhead99> And smash
[2:04:55] <Man_in_the_Red> @jetjagger222 DOA5 dlc but its not as good
[2:04:56] <SuddenDeath> VF5FS is compatible in Xbox series X
[2:04:59] <%Irridium> not on PS3 though for whatever reason
[2:05:02] <DSD24> @jetjagger222 Numerous shitty decisions by Team Ninja and it didn't sell well
[2:05:12] <Solidnick18> doa6 killed all the virtua fighter characters so i guess whatever
[2:05:14] <tiaramaki> I was happy when I found it on the PSN on the PS3 still. But I haven't checked to see if online play is a thing
[2:05:16] <%jetjagger222> oof
[2:05:17] <neroblind88> it needs a port
[2:05:28] <tiaramaki> *still a thing, rather
[2:05:29] <Guntanks_in_Space> @DSD24 to add, no more DOA updates apparently
[2:05:36] <SomersaultJustice> doa6 was so disappointing
[2:05:50] <Shardlab> Sega had to look at reports to find out they like money
[2:05:51] <DSD24> @Guntanks_in_Space Yeah it was a real shame, I liked the new characters they added
[2:05:52] <fIashman92> VF6 announced in less than 12 hour amirite?
[2:05:57] <Shardlab> ....from Persona
[2:06:03] <Guntanks_in_Space> i actually kinda liked seeing Tamaki lol
[2:06:05] <GeltonZ> DOA6 was garbage. Go back to DOA5. DOA5 is amazing and wonderful and deserves more love.
[2:06:10] <MKII> they'd probably lose more money trying to resell it as a new package
[2:06:11] <DSD24> DOA5 Last Round is still the best DOA game
[2:06:12] <Man_in_the_Red> VF6 never
[2:06:12] <SableS139a> Yeah, the full experience of VF5 is playing on 360 & PS3 with all the additional content.
[2:06:13] <@Menitta> It is funny how people ask for Kiryu in Tekken and not VF
[2:06:13] <Guntanks_in_Space> elegant girl breaking your bones fairly quickly
[2:06:17] <%barkon345> o VF4 evo
[2:06:20] <%Irridium> @Guntanks_in_Space I can't believe the multiple $80 season passes didn't keep it going
[2:06:20] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> woolieKICKDAD
[2:06:24] <+deadmandro> Reggie?/?
[2:06:27] <GeltonZ> @DSD24 *DOA5 bro fist*
[2:06:31] <%barkon345> no VF4 Evolution
[2:06:32] <Man_in_the_Red> you can quote me on that shit if it hits Poorly Aged things, VF6 NEVER
[2:06:42] <Solidnick18> yo
[2:06:43] <SableS139a> @Guntanks_in_Space Busting Kneecaps and Ohoho-ing to victory.
[2:06:47] <Solidnick18> the rumble fish?
[2:06:49] <%jetjagger222> they're more likely to have kiryu in tekken than vf6
[2:06:52] <DSD24> @GeltonZ Eyyyyy *DOA5 bro fist*
[2:06:52] <fIashman92> Final Showdown Showdown?
[2:06:55] <%Malik1002> why did Reggie look right at me when Woolie finished reading like into my soul
[2:06:57] <SableS139a> Truly Aoi Umenokouji is a classy lady
[2:07:10] <%jetjagger222> and if kiryu plays like a VF character in tekken, our defeat is complete
[2:07:16] <Guntanks_in_Space> i actually tried playing Aoi in 5FS lol
[2:07:18] <%Irridium> I liked DOA4 because it had a Halo Spartan in it. I'm a simple man with simple tastes.
[2:07:20] <Solidnick18> i know what the rumble fish is from the old channel
[2:07:23] <Guntanks_in_Space> a lot of stances to wrap my head around
[2:07:27] <Fenlig> Did someone call Reggie, FunkMasterFeet?
[2:07:27] <%jetjagger222> the rumble fish?
[2:07:28] <Guntanks_in_Space> but she's fluid enough
[2:07:32] <DSD24> @Irridium Wasn't that Nicole? she was cool
[2:07:36] <%FuqBoiSlim> The Rumble Fish?
[2:07:41] <%jetjagger222> the rumble fish
[2:07:49] <Guntanks_in_Space> @Irridium it's kinda wild no?
[2:08:02] <+deadmandro> Why they call Reggie that?
[2:08:02] <%jetjagger222> the other filipino fighting game character aside from talim
[2:08:09] <GeltonZ> Oh geeze The Rumble Fish. Second game is alright but first one is awful if you ask me. Controls are SO Dimpsy.
[2:08:16] <%jetjagger222> and that guy from def jam
[2:08:19] <SomersaultJustice> isn't Josie filipino
[2:08:20] <Guntanks_in_Space> oh yeah
[2:08:21] <deafmelone> The Rumble Fish 2 Fight For Survival
[2:08:23] <%jetjagger222> oh fuck
[2:08:23] <emeraldskrull> Reggie is the Ponyboy of WoolieVs
[2:08:25] <%jetjagger222> forgot about josie
[2:08:29] <%jetjagger222> i hate josie more than lion
[2:08:29] <Guntanks_in_Space> Nicole was one of the earlier Filipino fighters
[2:08:29] <%Irridium> @DSD24 yep. She had a sick stage too. Pretty much just the hanger bay from the opening level of Halo 2.
[2:08:32] <Guntanks_in_Space> Talim was the pioneer
[2:08:33] <GeltonZ> <3 Josie <3
[2:08:38] <Guntanks_in_Space> then Nicole/Spartan and then Josie
[2:08:41] <DSD24> Oh man I was so hyped for Josie but her personality sucks ass
[2:08:41] <huskarl_zap> back to book club?
[2:08:43] <SableS139a> @SomersaultJustice Yeah. Josie was one of the only notable Filipino fighters after Tali came into existence.
[2:08:47] <MKII> things really be rough all over
[2:08:48] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:08:51] <Guntanks_in_Space> oh and don't forget about SANTOS
[2:08:54] <Guntanks_in_Space> from Def Jam FFNY
[2:08:54] <SableS139a> @SomersaultJustice *Talim
[2:08:57] <huskarl_zap> CURSED
[2:08:58] <%jetjagger222> SANTOS GANG

[2:09:42] <Guntanks_in_Space> feels like Josie suffers from anxiety
[2:09:44] <%jetjagger222> she also has the fashion sense of minnie mouse
[2:09:51] <Guntanks_in_Space> in spite of being a successful model and a kickboxer

[2:10:46] <GeltonZ> @DSD24 I literally think it's some kind of weird mental issue. Like she just can't stop crying.
[2:10:47] <@akuda_bar> since when is it thursday BibleThump why am i late
[2:10:47] <anarchistPastry> The Rumble... Fish...!
[2:10:47] <SomersaultJustice> isn't there a rumble fish 2?
[2:10:54] <Shardlab> yes
[2:11:04] <GeltonZ> @SomersaultJustice There is but it had no home port. Which sucks because it is a MUCH better game.
[2:11:08] <SuddenDeath> girl wrestling game
[2:11:18] <Shardlab> It got a PS2 Japanese port, but never anything else
[2:11:20] <%FuqBoiSlim> @akuda_bar you missed the virtua fighter fam shofuWhy
[2:11:23] <DSD24> @GeltonZ Its weird too cause she's fine before fights, albeit a bit nervous but as soon as she wins big tears
[2:11:24] <Super_Voltekka> Atomiswave is a bitch to emulate
[2:11:29] <%TubeMan642> THE RUMBLE FISH?
[2:11:31] <%jetjagger222> the aughts had some weird-ass experimental fighting games
[2:11:51] <+jiggy_snipe> nope only 3
[2:12:04] <SableS139a> SF3 & Red Earth
[2:12:20] <Guntanks_in_Space> neogeo died so they moved towards atomiswave
[2:12:23] <SableS139a> There WAS supposed to be a Darkstalkers 4 for the CPS3 hardware, but it never happened.
[2:12:24] <neroblind88> kof 11
[2:12:27] <%jetjagger222> kenji/mukuro is fucking cool
[2:12:33] <@Menitta> THAT'S what Neowave is?!
[2:12:36] <Guntanks_in_Space> and yeah it was neowave first, as a testbench
[2:12:38] <Guntanks_in_Space> YUP
[2:12:39] <Shardlab> The game has procedural damage on the models, but that's hard as hell to run on the old systems
[2:12:50] <Guntanks_in_Space> neowave is "yo let's see what we can do with the atomiswave hardware"
[2:13:00] <@Menitta> was it any good?
[2:13:03] <Guntanks_in_Space> janky
[2:13:11] <@Menitta> now I gotta get it lol
[2:13:17] <Guntanks_in_Space> and young geese, the (playable) boss character was ALL SORTS OF MESSED UP
[2:13:21] <%jetjagger222> lol
[2:13:22] <SomersaultJustice> yeah I remember not liking neowave
[2:13:22] <Guntanks_in_Space> but it has its charms
[2:13:25] <%jetjagger222> the rumble fih
[2:13:49] <Guntanks_in_Space> and it would later lead into Neogeo Battle Coliseum and KOF XI
[2:13:51] <%jetjagger222> gundam battle master/battle assault did that as well
[2:13:53] <Super_Voltekka> Made by Dimps with 60FPS 2D
[2:14:04] <deafmelone> @menitta. Neowave is a Janky version of Kof 2002
[2:14:19] <GeltonZ> Ported to PS2 not 1 but I 'm sure he misspoke
[2:14:24] <tearfuldevil> the rumble fish
[2:14:24] <DSD24> Oh man Battle Assault 2 is so good
[2:14:28] <DSD24> I love that game
[2:14:30] <%jetjagger222> and so broken
[2:14:30] <Guntanks_in_Space> @Menitta it's really weird, but kind of worth a look lol
[2:14:36] <Guntanks_in_Space> just to see how weird it is

[2:27:40] <+Dova573> PogChamp
[2:27:56] <BoneBagMel> that looks like limb sprites
[2:28:05] <Leafboi125> Woolie's Mom: "THE RUMBLE FISH?!?!?
[2:28:25] <fernandapsdois> The Rumble Fish
[2:28:48] <%FuqBoiSlim> The characters look like the Pokemon battle sprites from black and white
[2:28:49] <Guntanks_in_Space> yes
[2:29:03] <%Reverend_Roscoe> is this gonna be on parsec?
[2:29:14] <+jiggy_snipe> I doubt it
[2:29:14] <SuddenDeath> any game can be on parse3c
[2:29:17] <snoozeaholic> idk y Bazoo reminds me of a digimon
[2:29:34] <%FuqBoiSlim> Boxermon
[2:29:41] <tearfuldevil> @snoozeaholic i can see it
[2:29:43] <%jetjagger222> kind of looks like tamtam too
[2:29:44] <+TheScorpionEater> idk how i feel about these sprites tho
[2:29:45] <%FuqBoiSlim> or Devilboxermom
[2:29:48] <RoboticRexkek> it really looks like a 3D DS game.
[2:29:54] <haisho> yeah he looks like one
[2:29:54] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:29:58] <Solidnick18> LUL
[2:30:02] <eldragon_1> this is really weird. But interesting.
[2:30:08] <Super_Voltekka> S I M P
[2:30:13] <tearfuldevil> reminds me of, uh...belzemon, wendigomon, couple humanoid mons
[2:30:30] <fernandapsdois> chicken man
[2:30:35] <deafmelone> I thought there was defeat portraits?
[2:30:37] <%jetjagger222> hentai character
[2:30:38] <aus_htx> Rumble Fish 2?
[2:30:49] <black_pariah> the heart look
[2:30:56] <Super_Voltekka> Garnet's titties get more exposed as she gets more hurt
[2:31:01] <fernandapsdois> theres beaten up but still win portraits
[2:31:03] <odd_slater> Facesitting character
[2:31:06] <%FuqBoiSlim> It really looks like a sprite based flash newgrounds animation and im kinda digging it
[2:31:07] <%jetjagger222> garnet has a similar pose to a KOF character but i can't recall
[2:31:09] <huskarl_zap> elbow destruction
[2:31:22] <fernandapsdois> @jetjagger222 probly b jenet
[2:31:25] <@Menitta> god this game looks so weird
[2:31:32] <@akuda_bar> @RoboticRexkek now that i'm looking at it that way yeah, that's what it looks like
[2:31:33] <%jetjagger222> @fernandapsdois yeah you're right
[2:31:35] <@Menitta> they managed to make an old 3D look out of sprites
[2:31:37] <+jiggy_snipe> for heat moves Kappa
[2:31:42] <%SirGO0SE> @FuqBoiSlim it looks so so good
[2:31:47] <deafmelone> maybe what I'm thinking is either arcade mode only or you have to turn them on
[2:31:50] <fernandapsdois> that man got a power dunk?
[2:32:05] <GeltonZ> I gotta say, if you've never seen the Inuyasha PS1 fighter it's from the same devs and does this look a LOT better.
[2:32:09] <+TheScorpionEater> when did this come out?
[2:32:16] <%jetjagger222> it works well on mechs
[2:32:17] <RealPT1> and have depth
[2:32:22] <@Menitta> this was 04 I believe
[2:32:26] <@Menitta> 04 or 05
[2:32:29] <tearfuldevil> @GeltonZ is it an actually good fighting game?
[2:32:32] <%SirGO0SE> it looking unique makes it feel like it could have come out yesterday tbh
[2:32:33] <fernandapsdois> so Lud is ralf?
[2:32:33] <@akuda_bar> when lud turns his back on that punch, that looked really slick
[2:32:35] <%FuqBoiSlim> the ps2 port is from 2005
[2:32:37] <RoboticRexkek> yeah the smoothness throw me off a bit, but it does look good.
[2:32:43] <GeltonZ> @tearfuldevil No. Very simple. But very pretty.
[2:32:48] <RealPT1> a s init gives visual depth to individual parts
[2:32:49] <tearfuldevil> poo
[2:32:55] <Man_in_the_Red> considering it looks better than most gachapon i say they were successful
[2:33:15] <Man_in_the_Red> also most card games
[2:33:24] <fernandapsdois> dash cancel type beat
[2:33:42] <%FuqBoiSlim> I could see a this being a doujin fighter from like 2016-2017.
[2:33:59] <snoozeaholic> Man I kinda miss the racing game aesthetics they have in older fighters
[2:34:00] <tearfuldevil> are those two boss character slots?
[2:34:09] <@akuda_bar> bazoo looks like a literal rumble fish
[2:34:11] <@Menitta> Who is the rumbling fish
[2:34:23] <fernandapsdois> you press both heavies i think and it cancels your recovery with a dash
[2:34:56] <tearfuldevil> the different textures, the real long arms, and the stitches,a re really what make him look like a digmon
[2:35:03] <%FuqBoiSlim> @snoozeaholic yeah y2k aesthetic is one I would like to see come back
[2:35:04] <tearfuldevil> big visible stitches are hella digimon
[2:35:06] <%jetjagger222> kinda weregarurumon ish
[2:35:13] <+jiggy_snipe> yea he does have that look
[2:35:17] <eldragon_1> are these character specific intros?
[2:35:20] <%FuqBoiSlim> Rumblefishmon LUL

[2:35:42] <fernandapsdois> characters defensive supers are cool too

[2:42:10] <Guntanks_in_Space> the sprite movement makes me think of flash games

[2:46:41] <+Pookiedaexzile> and thinks your disgusting
[2:46:41] <tearfuldevil> does Woolie think that rei was the first stoic repressed female character
[2:46:52] <%jetjagger222> four murasame came before rei
[2:47:19] <+Pookiedaexzile> Anno hates you for liking Rei and Asuka, and you deserve it
[2:47:19] <%FuqBoiSlim> Based Boyd
[2:47:33] <%jetjagger222> the battle damage is kind of like art of fighting
[2:47:36] <+PJSmooth> The only fighting game character I know for sure is based on Rei is Shiki from Sam Sho
[2:47:48] <juicysal> I turn away for a second and blackface pat is fighting an animeboy, great.
[2:47:49] <tearfuldevil> also a lot of people were kids when they watched eva, and jsut picked who they like purely based off of visuals
[2:47:51] <+Pookiedaexzile> He made a whole movie about how you )(the audience) suck

[2:52:31] <+Pookiedaexzile> Geese vs Poison
[2:53:01] <huskarl_zap> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
[2:53:08] <%jetjagger222> "Programmed by ex-members of the Virtua Fighter team, this game has a yankee style, biker gang feel to it with characters varying from high school students to a yakuza type gangster via a wrestling-loving English teacher. The title means 'your opinion is worthless'. Fair enough. "
[2:53:19] <tearfuldevil> @huskarl_zap racism or classism is my guess
[2:53:23] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @huskarl_zap
[2:53:32] <@Menitta> @tearfuldevil yeah arcade
[2:53:35] <FlamingNarwhal> "the rumble fish" means "your opinion is worthless"?
[2:53:35] <tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus on ps2, it looks like you have to beat the story
[2:53:40] <%FuqBoiSlim> Moobot sniped another one NotLikeThis
[2:53:41] <aus_htx> Greed is CHEAP
[2:53:47] <tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus there's codes to unlock them, but only for arcade
[2:53:48] <%jetjagger222> man even this BGM sounds early-mid aughts
[2:53:57] <Super_Voltekka> You'd probably have to hack the game to unlock them
[2:53:59] <huskarl_zap> What if Samus Aran were a girl?

[3:03:23] <%FuqBoiSlim> I wonder what the rumble fish tier list looks like
[3:03:46] <+Pookiedaexzile> I wonder what the person who made it looks like
[3:04:14] <fernandapsdois> orville bring him back
[3:04:35] <%jetjagger222> its like anakaris coffin drop but good
[3:05:09] <townzzzzz> high low high llow
[3:05:16] <tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus looking at the wiki, most defensive arts seem to be B,HCB + LK/SK or LP/SP, but there are soem exceptions
[3:05:25] <%nimu290> the rumble fish
[3:05:35] <fernandapsdois> the rumble fish?
[3:05:36] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:05:39] <+Pookiedaexzile> Woolie hitting them subtle johns
[3:05:49] <%jetjagger222> BACK TO FLAVORTOWN
[3:05:51] <zenanon> the rumble fish The Rumble Fish
[3:05:57] <%FuqBoiSlim> duh wumble dish shedMald
[3:06:16] <townzzzzz> LUL
[3:06:19] <JdotSweapA> Hellooooo!
[3:06:22] <+Pookiedaexzile> Oh LAwd
[3:06:25] <JdotSweapA> LUL
[3:06:28] <+deviljhojho_> Wait this isnt the movie by francis ford coppola?
[3:06:29] <%FuqBoiSlim> HE ASKED FOR IT
[3:06:30] <huskarl_zap> THE Rumblee fish two????? SoonerLater
[3:06:32] <JdotSweapA> big big chungus
[3:06:52] <fernandapsdois> HCB Forward P with orville do it
[3:07:05] <zenanon> looks like this is using skeletal animated sprites kinda?
[3:07:07] <+Pookiedaexzile> Ginger Matoko?
[3:07:09] <tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus orville's defensive art is apperently HCF + LP/SP but only while blocking, zen's isn't listed
[3:07:56] <tearfuldevil> man the wikis formatting is not great lol
[3:08:52] <cowboydandank> i think it's 3d models with textures that mimic anime-shading
[3:09:15] <zenanon> it's a distinctive look
[3:09:16] <shin_zero_> No, they're sprites
[3:09:34] <%FuqBoiSlim> I think its individual sprites that get tweened. like in Pokemon black and white
[3:09:39] <shin_zero_> they just animate a unique way
[3:09:49] <zenanon> the arms especially look like they're skeletal sprites
[3:09:54] <zenanon> the way they move
[3:10:01] <theemotionalacehearts> ORVILLE IS FUCKIN HYPE
[3:10:11] <shin_zero_> I think they're compiled of sprite parts that make up the full character
[3:10:23] <zenanon> it's a neat look
[3:10:33] <+jiggy_snipe> lol
[3:10:35] <zenanon> probably cheaper by far than going full sprites
[3:10:38] <theemotionalacehearts> his defense gives infinite\ armor
[3:10:49] <GeltonZ> Honestly this style looks a LOT better at a lower resolution on PS1.
[3:10:51] <tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus critical arts seem to be either 2x QCF, 2x HCB (sometimes with B or F after SNK like), or QCB then HCF
[3:11:09] <zenanon> oh ffs
[3:11:11] <fernandapsdois> this is fine
[3:11:40] <Mordexai0> NICE
[3:11:41] <zenanon> he didn't have time to pick up a new shirt
[3:11:45] <BlackermanZX> yo thats sick
[3:12:11] <Super_Voltekka> How many clothes does Garnet lose with each match? Asking for a friend...
[3:12:27] <fernandapsdois> she drops her hat lol
[3:12:32] <cowboydandank> the battle damage mechanic would be really hard to do with traditional sprites, that's for sure
[3:12:39] <tearfuldevil> @Super_Voltekka bikini level
[3:12:40] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[3:18:25] <deafmelone> its a scorpion the way
[3:18:33] <RoboticRexkek> that shit is busted LUL
[3:18:57] <%FuqBoiSlim> Lud's got a shoulder from the gods. goddamn
[3:19:09] <Solidnick18> oh sick
[3:19:31] <townzzzzz> @WoolieVersus Lud has a special system of his own, as he can “parry” moves and charge his gauge meter as shown on the left. The higher the temperature, it supposedly can increase the number of hits (for some moves) and the damage of special moves. The temperature will decrease over time, with a minimum of 0 of course. Unlike 3rd strike, I think Lud can’t parry projectiles.

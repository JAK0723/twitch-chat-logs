[0:31:48] <FatDragonQuest> I never did that single player rpg mode, was that any good?
[0:31:54] <JayEarly> I really enjoy playing Geralt and I’m sad he’s gonna be stuck in this game
[0:31:55] <GrimmSquirrelGaming> what is even happening
[0:31:57] <+FireheadFTW> Ehhhhhyeahhh>>
[0:31:59] <+FireheadFTW> ??

[0:32:28] <dsauce999> Siegfried of Catarina?
[0:32:30] <FatDragonQuest> I played nightmare and then I stopped when 2b came out which is unfortunate cuz this game rules
[0:32:30] <+theunforgivingsquid> @fatdragonquest I liked the one in four
[0:32:31] <Dragon_Batman> That's the big thing that makes me sad about guests, they get stuck in the game they get put in
[0:32:36] <Sloavon> siegfried looks cool
[0:32:37] <WrongIM> Yeah its louder than thier voices
[0:32:48] <JayEarly> how active is PS4 online and did they fix the create a soul fuckery
[0:32:59] <AncelDeLambert> sounds fine to me
[0:33:03] <Sloavon> ps4 online sseems activve
[0:33:05] <TheGroovyGoblin> PS4 is pretty active.
[0:33:11] <FatDragonQuest> M-MOTHERR....
[0:33:23] <dsauce999> Pat: We Doing RAW SUPERS in here?!?!?!
[0:33:30] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> I forgot xianghua was a mutherrrrr
[0:33:35] <SomersaultJustice> the most legit super, raw super
[0:33:39] <Cptn_Turtle> Muh hand
[0:33:43] <Sloavon> was the nightmare hand always there or was that resently added?
[0:33:48] <b100d_orchid> PowerUpL
[0:33:50] <FatDragonQuest> is it actually rude to pull a raw super?
[0:33:57] <Cptn_Turtle> The nightmare hand was added
[0:33:58] <Dragon_Batman> That hand thing I think is new for this game
[0:33:59] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[0:34:00] <dsauce999> LUL
[0:34:01] <Zombrocom> My Hand is new to 6
[0:34:01] <%GohanEgret> reggie pls
[0:34:02] <%Solidnick18> oooooooo
[0:34:03] <Atomic_Blowfish> YEEEA
[0:34:13] <Sloavon> i mean the visual effect
[0:34:14] <%Nomad_Scholar> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[0:34:14] <JayEarly> @fatdragonquest if you get hit by one you deserve it tbh
[0:34:16] <ShutenDragoon> MY HAND PowerUpR
[0:34:19] <%chubbypencil> the immediate clapback
[0:34:24] <WrongIM> I thought it was rude to grab in soulcaliber
[0:34:25] <TheGroovyGoblin> His hand!
[0:34:30] <sunny_side_up> man i really should have bought sc6 instead of mk11 FeelsBadMan
[0:34:40] <dsauce999> The Raw Super is the ONLY way to use the super.
[0:34:42] <Zombrocom> Things are only rude if you a scrub
[0:35:12] <WrongIM> @zombrocom Dang ive been tricked by a scrub. I'm so ashamed
[0:35:16] <+Ecchigun> yo soul calibur in the house
[0:35:19] <moogleboy1984> Did Woolie introduce the couch?
[0:35:22] <%shmupdogjoe> pick raphael and doing preparation stance bullshit all day is rude at any speed
[0:35:29] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> people just get mad if you don't combo into supers because otherwise it's a gamble and if you're rewarded for the gamble, you were just lucky
[0:35:29] <%shmupdogjoe> and so are my X mixups
[0:35:41] <Zombrocom> Serious answer: Grabs are an important part of mixups and offense
[0:35:50] <FatDragonQuest> but what if I used the raw super to punish their whiff?
[0:36:03] <Zombrocom> That is there intended use in most cases
[0:36:12] <%shmupdogjoe> That is the rudest of all, FatDragonQuest. The sportsmanlike thing is to let them recover
[0:36:12] <minicookie713> Raw supers are only allowed on Mitsurugi xD
[0:36:15] <DiasFox> still not liking RE mechanic introduced into the series
[0:36:19] <ELJOVENBATALI> dont let scrubs talk down on you for landing the raw super they were supposed to avoid
[0:36:24] <Zombrocom> Combing into super rarely does much damage in this game cause scaling
[0:36:26] <WrongIM> @zombrocom my friend always would back out if more than 2 grabs were used
[0:36:26] <minicookie713> by Mitsurugi*
[0:36:31] <AncelDeLambert> fuccin COUNTAH
[0:36:32] <%shmupdogjoe> now, Miyamoto Musashi had a few things to say about sportsmanship's place in a sword fight that I think apply here...
[0:36:40] <Dragon_Batman> Supers get scaled a bit if it's mid combo anyways
[0:36:41] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> yeah scaling fucks supers a bit in this
[0:37:06] <dsauce999> Never Stop going in, and always RAW super. -36 Lessons of PatVec
[0:37:08] <cthulhu_senpai_> swol woolie PogChamp
[0:37:09] <Cameony> Anyone know if there's a fisticuff fighter in this game> Like maybe as a custom?
[0:37:14] <%Solidnick18> JUST KIDDING
[0:37:21] <AncelDeLambert> Remember Angriest Pat beating everyone at this game? I member, no I totally do shut up he did.
[0:37:25] <+FireheadFTW> JUST KIDDING
[0:37:25] <revzero25> yes there is
[0:37:27] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> actually the stupidest fucking character and i hate her
[0:37:27] <Sloavon> NO KILLING
[0:37:29] <SomersaultJustice> TehePelo
[0:37:33] <TheGroovyGoblin> There is no bare handed character in the game right now.
[0:37:34] <JayEarly> you gotta go in and go in and go in like the US Marshalls
[0:37:35] <Zombrocom> Not pure fists, though Azwel and 2B do a little punching
[0:37:41] <Zombrocom> a tiny bit
[0:37:43] <+Reizie_Etherealm> なんてね！
[0:37:45] <Cptn_Turtle> Pat did crush that fisticuffs
[0:37:45] <WrongIM> Lexia is way way worse
[0:37:46] <revzero25> Kappa
[0:37:50] <didgereedoodah> just pick voldo
[0:37:54] <+Binary_Fireball> Pat couldn't beat his dad at stair climbing
[0:38:00] <Cameony> Not gonna lie, I basically just want to use steve fox in this lol
[0:38:00] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:38:00] <Cptn_Turtle> But he had been playing
[0:38:03] <AncelDeLambert> okay, I see what you guys mean, the guest is a little hard to hear
[0:38:04] <Dragon_Batman> Pat was really the only one that played at the time
[0:38:06] <+Ecchigun> noiiiice
[0:38:06] <%Solidnick18> lol
[0:38:07] <SomersaultJustice> Scorpion Death Drop!
[0:38:11] <FatDragonQuest> jumping ddt!
[0:38:16] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Holy crap
[0:38:22] <dsauce999> Remember when Pat killed all of Achievement Hunter with his RAW skill? (In SC6)
[0:38:24] <AncelDeLambert> @WoolieVersus can you move whatever mic you have closer to our guest? He's getting lost in the noise.
[0:38:35] <ghostravens> @dsauce999 i do remember. vividly
[0:38:46] <+Reizie_Etherealm> KUMITE KUMlTE
[0:38:58] <Dragon_Batman> I love both Achievo hunters and the best friends but I've never been more proud of him
[0:38:59] <dsauce999> @ghostravens That is what they got for playing with KILLAHS
[0:39:28] <JayEarly> I love Nightmare’s super where he summons a horse from the Shadow Realm, it’s pretty metal
[0:39:35] <+Sirsquizz> apatPorgmo apatPorgmo apatPorgmo
[0:39:37] <SomersaultJustice> what's the simple xianghua juggle after launch again? like 6K A+B or something?
[0:39:44] <ghostravens> @dsauce999 "we asked them what they wanted to play. they smiled to each other and said "fighting games""
[0:39:48] <FatDragonQuest> god I'm excited for samurai shodown...
[0:39:55] <Hyper2faceman> Zasalamel's super is equally as good as Nightmare's
[0:40:06] <NocturnalRites> The french accent probably makes it easier for him to get lost in the noise
[0:40:08] <JayEarly> Me too and I’ve never played an SS
[0:40:22] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Where is that place anyway?
[0:40:45] <Cameony> looks like the forest, brother
[0:40:51] <JayEarly> Big Damage Gamblahs
[0:40:53] <AncelDeLambert> @NocturnalRites it does, yes
[0:41:05] <+Ecchigun> keep it hype montreal
[0:41:12] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> can you turn up the mic or reduce SFX volume a bit? it can be hard to hear you guys during the action. namely the guest @WoolieVersus
[0:41:14] <Cptn_Turtle> Yo so can we talk about soul charged Kilik?
[0:41:21] <%CountZero170> CountZero170 subscribed with Twitch Prime.

[0:42:11] <+TheyTookMyBeard> You have to scroll down its there
[0:42:13] <Slam_Punk> PJSalt
[0:42:17] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah there were some shit lacking in SCVI's ui on launch
[0:42:21] <+Double_Tap_That> Almost forgot what today was! Who's the resident expert this time?
[0:42:23] <Slam_Punk> Retroactive Salt
[0:42:24] <Guntanks_in_Space> but yeah they're working on it i think
[0:42:40] <Dragon_Batman> At least they're doing something
[0:42:42] <Guntanks_in_Space> even i'm baffled at things like "where's the pin movelist in training mode screen"
[0:42:42] <TheGroovyGoblin> Guest is MindWolf, arguably the best Montreal SoulCalibur player.

[0:45:54] <+Double_Tap_That> Hey chat, got any recommendations for a PC pad? Been using a 360 for this game, but the d-pad is ass.
[0:46:01] <Guntanks_in_Space> but they do make for good learning if they're kind enough to rematch
[0:46:06] <IndoorSitup> damn

[0:49:26] <IndoorSitup> WE GOT A MATCH HERE
[0:49:29] <JayEarly> he just wants to fight
[0:49:37] <Slam_Punk> Reb lobster REQUIRES it!
[0:49:37] <thelonechris> Going full edgelord
[0:49:46] <NocturnalRites> Mitsurugi is basically Ryu
[0:49:47] <dsauce999> POGGERS
[0:49:47] <Cptn_Turtle> That just frame is wicked hard btw
[0:49:49] <Slam_Punk> Ok It's out of me
[0:50:10] <FatDragonQuest> RE is so much fun
[0:50:11] <%Nomad_Scholar> this is equivalent of a grown man beating on a toddler
[0:50:13] <dsauce999> YEYeyeyeye
[0:50:14] <TheGroovyGoblin> Two best MTL players facing off right there.
[0:50:29] <JayEarly> wow
[0:50:30] <DiasFox> I don't like RE X(
[0:50:32] <xIgnitionCrowx> I don't know tech, I just know the feeling
[0:50:35] <Guntanks_in_Space> that was a strong-ass match
[0:50:42] <SomersaultJustice> I like RE
[0:50:44] <xIgnitionCrowx> I like re when others use it
[0:50:55] <+DesertPenguin09> Yo Woolie what's up with the neck bandanas? Looks rad
[0:51:00] <Dragon_Batman> RE is pretty neat
[0:51:02] <Guntanks_in_Space> i've reached the point where i don't really mind RE. it's good to bust out from time to time, but good players can punish it
[0:51:02] <FatDragonQuest> wait it uses meter now?
[0:51:02] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> RE breaks the pace of the match and I hate the meter gain
[0:51:07] <JayEarly> How did RE get nerfed?
[0:51:07] <Cptn_Turtle> RE is a super cool tool, I wished I used it more.
[0:51:09] <Guntanks_in_Space> though before i hated it lol
[0:51:11] <SomersaultJustice> woolie is channeling his hyrule warriors link
[0:51:12] <Zombrocom> Someone does RE, just sidestep and launch em
[0:51:17] <Guntanks_in_Space> when the meter gain was nuts
[0:51:23] <Dragon_Batman> It's also super easy to beat if you can spot it
[0:51:48] <unawakenedoozaru> What's Your GOUGI?
[0:52:18] <xIgnitionCrowx> it's like instinctual now cuz ppl used to...well STILL try to spam re or bait you into it. Easy back grabs.

[0:53:31] <Dragon_Batman> The two on the left
[0:53:33] <FatDragonQuest> holy shit that's actually a really cool nerf
[0:53:37] <Slam_Punk> Thats sick
[0:53:52] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah they made it so that RE is not inherently too better than GI now lol
[0:54:04] <Dragon_Batman> That's good
[0:54:12] <DiasFox> RE should never do so much damage lol
[0:54:18] <Guntanks_in_Space> because on a patch prior to this they got like stupid with the RE/GI balancing where whiffing GI would kill your guard
[0:54:24] <Guntanks_in_Space> now it seems a bit more even
[0:54:42] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> the meter gain is easily the most frustrating part about RE
[0:54:53] <+JingKaisean> did kilik just do a quadruple S?
[0:55:00] <Dragon_Batman> That used to be alot before
[0:55:06] <Zombrocom> The meter gain is heavily nerfed
[0:55:12] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> good tbh
[0:55:23] <cholongkh> voldo is so hot
[0:55:25] <Dragon_Batman> That is a good change
[0:55:33] <GrimmSquirrelGaming> damn this guy knows his shit
[0:55:46] <dsauce999> Notice Voldo's Bulge chet
[0:55:56] <GrimmSquirrelGaming> i mean how can you not?
[0:56:20] <Guntanks_in_Space> i love this dude's explanation of SCVI's intricacies. woolie picked a really good guest today
[0:56:22] <JayEarly> @cholongkh hey if you’re into that I won’t judge...much
[0:56:41] <GrimmSquirrelGaming> Yea i dont even like this game and im all ears for this guy
[0:56:45] <%Solidnick18> yo voldo
[0:56:47] <+greatmuta2> Woolie, when are you gonna play mvc 2 with the Infinite combo dude?
[0:56:52] <Guntanks_in_Space> @JingKaisean yeah it's kind of a Quad S if you think about it. popping soul charge on him turns on evil mode, but ending it heals him a little iirc
[0:57:01] <dsauce999> THIS IS HOW you do an infinite!!!
[0:57:08] <Guntanks_in_Space> @greatmuta2 oh man i'd watch that
[0:57:11] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> can you turn up the mic volume or turn down the game sfx a bit? can't hear you guys sometimes @WoolieVersus
[0:57:27] <GrimmSquirrelGaming> @WoolieVersus same i wanna hear you guys more
[0:57:45] <JayEarly> For real though, I actually think this Voldo design is kinda...cool?

[0:58:14] <IndoorSitup> Not sure if they're looking at chat, guys.
[0:58:15] <$FuqBoiSlim> why is voldo such a fucking freak, what made him this way
[0:58:16] <Dragon_Batman> Yea Voldo has always been super over designed but I think this game got a good mix
[0:58:35] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah he's all right here lol
[0:58:37] <Zombrocom> Voldo sat in a cave by himself for about 30 years
[0:58:40] <Zombrocom> He went insane
[0:58:41] <Cptn_Turtle> Not a lot of people play Voldo so its cool to see his crazy shit
[0:58:44] <Zombrocom> He hears voices
[0:58:52] <Dragon_Batman> He might have been trained as a kid as well?
[0:58:56] <Guntanks_in_Space> 1.0 SCVI there were a good amount of Voldo players
[0:58:59] <%shmupdogjoe> Voldo lives in a version of the 16th century where undead pirates sire BDSM ladies with whip swords. That is why he is a freak
[0:59:09] <dsauce999> BM GG NO RE
[0:59:09] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> I'll just keep commenting on it until they do. mic volume has been too low/game too loud for the past half hour
[0:59:10] <Dragon_Batman> He is a contortionist
[0:59:12] <Guntanks_in_Space> but in a bunch of the following patches they caned his nuts off and kneecaped him too
[0:59:32] <IndoorSitup> Guys game volume is too loud, you guys are too quiet.

[1:01:48] <Guntanks_in_Space> Ivy in general i like a lot of her alts over her main costumes
[1:01:52] <Guntanks_in_Space> SC3 being the best tho
[1:01:55] <JayEarly> SC2 alts had effort put into them
[1:01:56] <Guntanks_in_Space> but 2 is my personal favorite
[1:01:58] <Guntanks_in_Space> VERY CLASSY
[1:02:02] <+theunforgivingsquid> any one like lizardmans
[1:02:04] <%shmupdogjoe> I want to be able to put her back in the corsette from 1/2
[1:02:19] <NocturnalRites> But for real that is a great color for Ivy
[1:02:20] <prime_name> 5 has my favorite main Ivy costume

[1:03:30] <Guntanks_in_Space> @JayEarly i wish Geralt can be customized to wear other costumes. I need Geralt in a Kitty Mascot outfit
[1:03:41] <NocturnalRites> The tan skin and red hair does things to me
[1:03:42] <+Double_Tap_That> I want my mankini witcher

[1:04:59] <+DeaconBluesClues> @WoolieVersus are there any special moves from fighting games that sound cooler in french than in english
[1:05:03] <JayEarly> Geralt in a mankini saying “wanna play some Gwent?” seductively
[1:05:07] <Cptn_Turtle> Geralt can't be armor broken FeelsBadMan
[1:05:15] <$FuqBoiSlim> Geraldo de Riviero in 2B's leo KappaPride

[1:05:35] <Guntanks_in_Space> ash crimson's move list says yes

[1:05:39] <Guntanks_in_Space> even if he doesn't exist anymore

[1:05:50] <%JJCheeker> JJCheeker subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[1:05:53] <Danndy_Guy_in_Space> how do you say Hadoken in french
[1:05:56] <+Estuko> Was playing with that SBFP voice pack mod for XCOM2, it's SO GOOD.
[1:06:00] <dsauce999> French being cool? What? Kappa
[1:06:10] <mistersups> En Passe is also a chess term
[1:06:12] <DSD24> I love the SC 2 music man
[1:06:14] <+DeaconBluesClues> isn't 'en passant' "in passing"? it's a thing you do in chess
[1:06:20] <$FuqBoiSlim> More like Stench 4Head
[1:06:20] <Guntanks_in_Space> wait wait
[1:06:27] <KCDinc> en passant is a chess move
[1:06:28] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> lili from tekken has mostly english moves despite being french I think
[1:06:28] <Guntanks_in_Space> the best french in a fighting game is Pielle from Breaker's Revenge
[1:06:29] <nerdblase> It keeps pawns from being OP.
[1:06:31] <IndoorSitup> BLAAAAG
[1:06:33] <Guntanks_in_Space> you all need to hear Pielle
[1:06:33] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:06:38] <+Ecchigun> CEST UNE BLAGUE
[1:06:40] <TheGroovyGoblin> Yeah, "en passant" is the chess term.
[1:06:44] <+bv728> En Passant is also a Fencing term
[1:07:01] <Parapattern> En Pissant
[1:07:03] <TheGroovyGoblin> It roughly translates to "as I pass through".
[1:07:07] <minicookie713> haha le bébé y pleure xD
[1:07:21] <TheGroovyGoblin> Baguette baguette François Hollande.
[1:07:21] <generalve> is... is that broly legs ?
[1:07:24] <+DeaconBluesClues> @nerdblase it's actually way dumber. back in the day pawns always moves one space. at somepoint they were like 'we gotta speed this shit up' and let them move two on their first movement. but then people complained 'but I could have taken you pawn under the old rules, fucker'. en passant is the compremise patch to make everyone happy.
[1:07:25] <Guntanks_in_Space> woolie getting blender'd, but i appreciate you picking sieg
[1:07:32] <Guntanks_in_Space> he's a favorite, but i'm an astaroth main lol
[1:07:36] <DSD24> All I can do is this!
[1:07:37] <dsauce999> KEK Shows!
[1:07:40] <$FuqBoiSlim> What's going on i dont speak Italian
[1:08:05] <+DeaconBluesClues> also back in the day is like 'over a 1000 years ago or some shit like that'
[1:08:17] <Guntanks_in_Space> also sieg could have rung Kilik out with 4B, but that's a pretty obvious move to pick when backed in a corner
[1:08:18] <Zombrocom> Woolie really shouldn't panic super, seigs super is slow as hell, 20 frames of startup
[1:08:30] <Guntanks_in_Space> Launchers are generally 20-21? i forget

[1:08:52] <Guntanks_in_Space> @DSD24 he's really strong in this patch. gimme that tackle cancel and 12F knee stomp lol
[1:08:59] <DSD24> Man its a struggle but he's fun as hell
[1:09:08] <Guntanks_in_Space> @Double_Tap_That on both ends too lol. he's got no 12F move and is slow, but he still shits out damage
[1:09:10] <Zombrocom> Nightmare is a scrubkiller, he really punishes players who dont know how to play
[1:09:13] <EnlightenedKramer> yoooo
[1:09:15] <Dragon_Batman> Nightmare is awesome, super oppressive but kool
[1:09:22] <ConLin_Arts_> how is 2B in this game?
[1:09:25] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> are we gonna see some gunvantes today

[1:10:04] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah she's become a bit of a mixup monster with how she can float into jump/aggression dashes
[1:10:04] <DSD24> @Zombrocom ironic cause he has that unblockable stomp
[1:10:04] <+bv728> that's so anime.
[1:10:08] <+NarcissistCactus> 2B's mixups are fake outside of soul charge
[1:10:09] <Guntanks_in_Space> and she's just fast
[1:10:23] <IndoorSitup> Mon aéroglisseur est plein d'anguilles.
[1:10:26] <Guntanks_in_Space> but she's beatable in that you can, for instance, RE out of her AGS shit
[1:10:32] <ConLin_Arts_> neato!
[1:10:43] <Dragon_Batman> kool kool
[1:10:49] <+Double_Tap_That> Have they voiced the opinions on RE?

[1:13:58] <jimminyjammyjam> Hey, Woolzlord, thanks for turning me onto Glove on fighter 2

[1:13:58] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah the best thing to do against sieg when he's doing stance shenanigans and hit him with a fast move
[1:14:08] <DSD24> Oh cool some Taki!
[1:14:10] <Dragon_Batman> Any 2B good 2B

[1:14:40] <worldbrand> No, do a sitting judgement cut
[1:14:41] <mistersups> 2P was a massive meaty bone thrown to the black cosply community
[1:14:44] <chicken_brotherr> I'd like 2B 2P on me
[1:14:48] <%DRAGUN_Xrd> DRAGUN_Xrd subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[1:14:49] <jimminyjammyjam> Can we get Geralt in the 2B dress tho?
[1:15:02] <Guntanks_in_Space> woolie when are you gonna do a Judgement Nut
[1:15:15] <DSD24> @jimminyjammyjam No but you can get every girl in it
[1:15:25] <$cherubs_anonymous> I think Xrd's super fun to watch
[1:15:29] <mistersups> Xrd is hard to watch if you don't play Xrd
[1:15:32] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Wow
[1:15:33] <+jorgamund> the word you're looking for is "non-anime"
[1:15:39] <IndoorSitup> OH SHIT BOY
[1:15:58] <TheGershon> 3D vs 2D (gameplay)?
[1:15:59] <+Double_Tap_That> They need an option to turn off battle damage to make it more mainstream friendly
[1:16:09] <+gwyndolinisbestwaifu> GET SMOKED
[1:16:11] <JayEarly> @mistersups “meaty bone” indeed
[1:16:15] <+Double_Tap_That> Plus I just like having my character's clothes on
[1:16:21] <+case01> Crunchy Vegetables
[1:16:23] <blackbookalpha> this ain't skullgirls. what is this?
[1:16:23] <SomersaultJustice> I really want an option to not have certain clothing parts break, like you designate 3 parts to not break ever
[1:16:26] <IndoorSitup> BECOME AS GODS
[1:16:30] <mtlwolf_> that leg lift up Kreygasm
[1:16:36] <IndoorSitup> THIS CANNOT CONTINUE
[1:16:50] <Dragon_Batman> Self destruct? no
[1:17:07] <Tucker0603> how did I miss this? and what's with the camera?!?!?
[1:17:09] <dsauce999> THERE ARE HUMANS HERE?!?!
[1:17:13] <+Double_Tap_That> It would be crazy if they added Monster Hunter to this game.
[1:17:19] <+Double_Tap_That> But also rad.
[1:17:21] <DSD24> She doesn't know what humans look like though
[1:17:24] <JayEarly> Ass vs Titties, the eternal war
[1:17:28] <SomersaultJustice> Ending F: Tale o[F] Swords and Souls
[1:17:32] <IndoorSitup> Monster Hunter was already in MvCI tho
[1:17:37] <DSD24> @JayEarly I mean Taki has both
[1:18:09] <+Double_Tap_That> @indoorsitup I know, but I want her in a game I play
[1:18:10] <SomersaultJustice> PogChamp
[1:18:48] <%Solidnick18> 2b Kreygasm
[1:18:51] <chicken_brotherr> I like that Taki's got the mask back, it's cool
[1:19:00] <chicken_brotherr> and hot
[1:19:05] <mugwhump> waifu battle PogChamp
[1:19:05] <Tucker0603> why there so few people? SC6 is great
[1:19:07] <SomersaultJustice> Harada : Get out Appearing Weapon tech in everything NOW
[1:19:11] <IndoorSitup> Man, I would not mind either of these two stepping on me, eh Reggie?
[1:19:14] <mugwhump> yeah sc6 rocks
[1:19:21] <Guntanks_in_Space> wait you don't want 2B stepping on you
[1:19:27] <Zombrocom> It's forward super
[1:19:30] <Dragon_Batman> I think it might have a different super
[1:19:30] <Zombrocom> For self destruct
[1:19:34] <Dragon_Batman> yea
[1:19:41] <Guntanks_in_Space> you want her **sitting** on you, and then cracking your neck like what happened to that 9S picture lol
[1:19:58] <Zombrocom> Self destruct has a ton of startup though
[1:20:11] <chicken_brotherr> I want 2B to choke me to death with her strong android lady fingers
[1:20:25] <JayEarly> whoa
[1:20:27] <%Solidnick18> lol
[1:20:27] <JayEarly> whoaaaaa
[1:20:33] <IndoorSitup> I forget, does self destruct destroy her skirt in this one?
[1:20:36] <Guntanks_in_Space> yes
[1:20:36] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule

[1:20:57] <the_Deadpan_Man> what's with the camera?
[1:21:01] <JayEarly> i’m pretty sure that was in the contract

[1:21:23] <Guntanks_in_Space> Geralt's ez to pick up and play somehow
[1:21:23] <ghostravens> can i play geralt?
[1:21:24] <IndoorSitup> @somersaultjustice That might be risky tho
[1:21:27] <DeathByPoke7> geralt is like ryu
[1:21:27] <%Solidnick18> Astaroth Kreygasm
[1:21:27] <Dragon_Batman> Geralt is super straight foward
[1:21:29] <+nawji> zasmasal
[1:21:34] <%Solidnick18> MAGGOT
[1:21:34] <+theunforgivingsquid> Zasalamel
[1:21:38] <Guntanks_in_Space> YOU FILTHY MAGGOTS
[1:21:39] <%Solidnick18> lol
[1:21:40] <DSD24> Yes Astaroth!
[1:21:42] <Guntanks_in_Space> yo Asta rules
[1:21:42] <SomersaultJustice> I dunno, max did it all the time
[1:21:45] <mistersups> You fil-thy MAGGOT!
[1:21:48] <chicken_brotherr> where my mitsurugis at
[1:21:52] <SolGoodguy> look at that homie brain connect
[1:21:56] <IndoorSitup> DAMN YOU'RE UGLY
[1:21:57] <DSD24> Filthy Maggots!
[1:22:01] <SolGoodguy> woolie and reggie on the same wavelength
[1:22:07] <IndoorSitup> HOW'S THAT SILVER?
[1:22:10] <DSD24> Getting ready to dunk on people
[1:22:19] <JayEarly> Astaroth is like a Chaos Warrior from Warhammer
[1:22:23] <SolGoodguy> How's that silver but he's using the steel sword
[1:22:23] <JayEarly> which is raw
[1:22:34] <SolGoodguy> LUL
[1:22:38] <Guntanks_in_Space> he uses the silver primarily in Monhun at least lol
[1:22:41] <IndoorSitup> Naturally
[1:22:46] <Dragon_Batman> Silver is used in specific moves
[1:22:49] <chicken_brotherr> more like Bitcher haha
[1:22:49] <DrFacilier> Gwent Simulator 3
[1:23:02] <Guntanks_in_Space> his ending has him doing some bitcher stuff heh
[1:23:12] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I heard about a mod where the combat was replaced with Gwent
[1:23:21] <JayEarly> @chicken_brotherr i’m pretty sure that’s the porn parody
[1:23:37] <IndoorSitup> Steel sword is used for humans. Silver sword is for monsters and other supernaturals. In this game he can use either whenever.
[1:23:41] <%Solidnick18> YES
[1:23:43] <%Solidnick18> oh
[1:23:47] <%strugglepunk2> strugglepunk2 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! DID SOMEONE SAY A TALE OF SOULS AND SWORDS?! HELL YEAH!
[1:23:49] <Happy_Acciden> did woolie play the geralt mission in monster hunter
[1:23:51] <SomersaultJustice> test
[1:24:10] <DSD24> Depends on the move
[1:24:12] <Dragon_Batman> I don't think Woolie has touched monster hunter for a while
[1:24:23] <Dragon_Batman> maybe not even since Deviljho
[1:24:49] <IndoorSitup> When are y'all gonna play on the Witcher stage? The music for that is Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:24:59] <+theunforgivingsquid> Deviljho fights are long and brutal
[1:25:04] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah the kaer morhen BGM is so good
[1:25:16] <Guntanks_in_Space> oh man the Geralt quest in Monhun is an exercise in tedium
[1:25:18] <IndoorSitup> HEEEYYYYY HEY HEY HEYYYYY

[1:25:32] <IndoorSitup> HEY HEY HEY HEYYYYYYY

[1:26:06] <Dragon_Batman> Is he any good?
[1:26:12] <Guntanks_in_Space> oh he is
[1:26:12] <JayEarly> Does anyone but Geralt use meter for special moves?
[1:26:22] <Guntanks_in_Space> he's not Ridic good like in pre-patch but he's all right
[1:26:24] <SomersaultJustice> @JayEarly Yoshimitsu
[1:26:27] <Guntanks_in_Space> @JayEarly i think Yoshi too
[1:26:30] <chicken_brotherr> damn 6-0'd
[1:26:49] <+Zubaz> Woolie is play Calibur!?

[1:26:50] <IndoorSitup> Witcher stage when?
[1:26:52] <DSD24> I hope this game gets a Season 2
[1:26:54] <chicken_brotherr> gonna call you ass-taroth
[1:27:03] <DeathByPoke7> i love this video game
[1:27:05] <Dragon_Batman> I always found Tira alot of fun
[1:27:10] <dsauce999> PatMare?
[1:27:13] <+Zubaz> I fucking love Calibur
[1:27:20] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> gunvantes PogChamp
[1:27:32] <DSD24> Hilde
[1:27:33] <Guntanks_in_Space> Hildegarde
[1:27:35] <%Solidnick18> hilde
[1:27:39] <Guntanks_in_Space> which i hope is indeed part of the DLC
[1:27:39] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:27:41] <+jorgamund> bring back Hilde BibleThump
[1:27:46] <IndoorSitup> Man, she was great.
[1:27:48] <Guntanks_in_Space> i know she was in the "leaked" list
[1:27:49] <Tucker0603> I WANT HILDE IN HERE
[1:27:54] <SomersaultJustice> bring her back, but without her weird charges >>
[1:27:57] <IndoorSitup> Really hope she comes back.
[1:28:11] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> I still think it was stupid that she carried a polearm and a dagger instead of just two-handing the polearm
[1:28:16] <+Zubaz> Hilde is sick
[1:28:20] <dsauce999> STEVE MINECRAFT!!!
[1:28:23] <%Solidnick18> lol
[1:28:31] <IndoorSitup> Man I also wish Yoda would return. Kappa
[1:28:41] <Dragon_Batman> I do hope if Hilde comes back they change up her hold stuff too
[1:28:42] <DSD24> @TURBOSUPLEX3000 I mean we got Mina and Kilik I bet they wanted someone who dual wielded
[1:28:42] <chicken_brotherr> Minecraft Steven can suck my cock
[1:28:46] <IndoorSitup> Yoda is best Soulcalibur.
[1:28:55] <DSD24> I bet Cassandra is next
[1:29:01] <%Solidnick18> what about star killer
[1:29:01] <Guntanks_in_Space> getting those MUH HANDS in
[1:29:05] <dsauce999> Link.fbx, Linkara.fbx
[1:29:09] <Dragon_Batman> I think Cass is next too
[1:29:10] <Guntanks_in_Space> starkiller lives on in spirit via Groh
[1:29:25] <DSD24> Groh is cooler than the Apprentice
[1:29:38] <+Zubaz> step block is 12 frames, back step block is 14 frames
[1:29:39] <Dragon_Batman> Groh at least has anime on his side
[1:29:43] <Guntanks_in_Space> i wanted to learn Groh for a bit, but Sophitia and the big bap beckons
[1:29:48] <IndoorSitup> Sorry but Starkiller is not canon. Thanks Didney!
[1:29:53] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> @DSD24 yeah I feel you but I think her fighting style suffers
[1:30:01] <SolGoodguy> this is my first time hearing such a strong accent, I like his accent
[1:30:07] <NocturnalRites> Groh has some cool stuff going on
[1:30:07] <%ChoculaUltra> the real meta is how to do fancy shit thats distracting enough to get those clutch lows in
[1:30:10] <Guntanks_in_Space> dude Sieg and Nightmare's dropkicks are strong lol
[1:30:11] <Tucker0603> fucking love the dropkick
[1:30:17] <+Zubaz> @guntanks_in_space Hey, brew
[1:30:23] <%Solidnick18> lol
[1:30:26] <Guntanks_in_Space> @Zubaz oh man how fitting i see you here lol
[1:30:28] <chicken_brotherr> Cass gotta come back so she can do that face sit super
[1:30:30] <+Zubaz> LOL
[1:30:33] <DSD24> @TURBOSUPLEX3000 I think they can make it work I'd like to see how they would do her in this game
[1:30:34] <+Zubaz> u rite
[1:30:36] <+Icer107> Rainbow has such a weird input though, like, sprint + SELECT?
[1:30:41] <DSD24> The best Nightmare was in SC2
[1:30:42] <Guntanks_in_Space> Sieggy discord represent!
[1:30:43] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> right on
[1:30:50] <Dragon_Batman> I think Soul Cal 3 with the scarf is up there too
[1:30:50] <IndoorSitup> You guys ever try dropkicking IRL, shit hurts when you land.
[1:30:54] <+Zubaz> Woolie doesn't know I exist lol
[1:31:09] <+Icer107> you gotta turn and catch with your arms to mitigate the fall
[1:31:17] <NocturnalRites> I miss some of Mitsurugis moves from 2
[1:31:26] <JayEarly> @worldbrand god I want Obama to say “ A tale of Swords...and Souls. Eternally...retold!”
[1:31:26] <+Icer107> will still hurt like a bitch, but a little less than just flat landing LUL
[1:31:32] <%Solidnick18> @IndoorSitup yes
[1:31:34] <DSD24> The worst Mitsu was in SC5 where they took is sheath stance away
[1:31:38] <Guntanks_in_Space> oh yeah
[1:31:55] <dsauce999> TOES
[1:31:58] <+Zubaz> Mitsu was top tier in SC5
[1:32:02] <%Solidnick18> lol
[1:32:05] <Floofiie> hit the stand
[1:32:07] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> 4A+B to fire the gun
[1:32:08] <dsauce999> FOOTSIES
[1:32:09] <Guntanks_in_Space> moveset-wise he was gutted, but THOSE CLEAN HITS THO
[1:32:16] <Tucker0603> XD
[1:32:17] <+Zubaz> He was actually one of the best character's in the game lol
[1:32:21] <SomersaultJustice> shoot the gun!
[1:32:26] <dsauce999> marthgrabrange.jpg
[1:32:28] <NocturnalRites> Mitsu is also missing one of his Moon death stances
[1:32:32] <Tucker0603> I want Zwei back...
[1:32:33] <IndoorSitup> So, we all in agreement that Sigfried's best look is his III look?
[1:32:39] <%Solidnick18> aye trophy
[1:32:40] <Guntanks_in_Space> SC3, player 2
[1:32:43] <DSD24> @Zubaz I bet he was I just didn't like that stance was taken away
[1:32:48] <SolGoodguy> SC3 player 2 is best
[1:32:50] <Dragon_Batman> I mean i agree with that
[1:32:51] <SolGoodguy> yes
[1:32:58] <DSD24> @IndoorSitup He had the best English voice too
[1:33:08] <+Zubaz> Are these MTL SC6 players?
[1:33:10] <IndoorSitup> Fuckin Crispin Freeman
[1:33:13] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah @Zubaz
[1:33:13] <SolGoodguy> did they change his voice in 6? i don't remember
[1:33:15] <IndoorSitup> So awesome
[1:33:23] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah they changed VAs for Sieggy
[1:33:26] <SolGoodguy> i just know that sieg in 6 is all "JUST LEAVE ME ALONE ALREADY"
[1:33:31] <+Zubaz> I am known as the MTL Slayer for SC6
[1:33:44] <+Nifkinator> who's the best in the game? top 3?
[1:33:45] <Dragon_Batman> They kept the same voice actor in Japanese tho
[1:33:55] <DSD24> Nightmare vs Siegried has the coolest interactions in this game
[1:33:56] <+NarcissistCactus> azwel siegfried are up there
[1:33:57] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeah it's still Nobuyuki Hiyama
[1:34:03] <+Zubaz> There's a lot of good character's in SC6
[1:34:04] <NocturnalRites> How can't you love the dlcet tones of Crispin Freeman
[1:34:05] <Dragon_Batman> love that guy
[1:34:08] <FrustratedAF> thiiisss split cam things seems a little weird
[1:34:10] <Guntanks_in_Space> aka Joe, Viral, Batsu, etc etc
[1:34:10] <IndoorSitup> Best Sigfiried appearance? III 2P gets my vote.
[1:34:12] <FrustratedAF> but yay soulcal :D
[1:34:15] <+Zubaz> Everyone is totally viable in DC6
[1:34:18] <+Zubaz> SC6

[1:34:56] <SolGoodguy> sophitia is really good though reggie
[1:34:56] <NocturnalRites> I kind of miss how broken talim was in 2
[1:34:57] <+Zubaz> Sophie is not bottom 5
[1:35:00] <xIgnitionCrowx> lies
[1:35:05] <Cptn_Turtle> @WoolieVersus Where is the best place to go for character/combo guides for SC6?
[1:35:05] <Guntanks_in_Space> nope, not even
[1:35:06] <JayEarly> I love Yoshi’s design but he plays so weird
[1:35:06] <+balouie> how is tira in this game
[1:35:08] <+Zubaz> And Taki is pretty good now
[1:35:10] <IndoorSitup> What tier is mah boi Geralt?
[1:35:11] <Guntanks_in_Space> personally i think Sophie's mid-ish
[1:35:16] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Talim is best girl confirmed.
[1:35:17] <+NarcissistCactus> tira got buffed a bunch so she's actually viable now
[1:35:19] <Guntanks_in_Space> Geralt is probably pretty high up there
[1:35:19] <Tucker0603> hey guys, who's the best character for someone who likes defensive/counter-attackers? trying to nail down my CAS style
[1:35:23] <DSD24> Yoshi has the best CE
[1:35:31] <+Zubaz> Mid tier is A tier in SC6
[1:35:34] <+NarcissistCactus> if you like defense amy has lots of stance guard impacts
[1:35:37] <+Zubaz> @balouie She's good
[1:35:50] <DSD24> @Tucker0603 Sophitia has some good defensive options
[1:35:50] <+balouie> oh good I remember in the beginning she was kind of sucky
[1:35:53] <+jorgamund> the best waifus are never bottom tier, even when they are
[1:36:03] <+Zubaz> @balouie They gave her a lot of buffs
[1:36:11] <IndoorSitup> Sophi is best girl dont @ me
[1:36:20] <JayEarly> @zubaz is there a low tier?
[1:36:23] <dsauce999> GGGGGG
[1:36:26] <Guntanks_in_Space> @IndoorSitup nah man i'll @ you (because i agree)
[1:36:26] <ghostravens> what type of inputs does this game have?
[1:36:31] <+Zubaz> @jayearly No
[1:36:38] <+ThatOneGameTester> Is Ivy still good? if she ever was, i wasnt competative.
[1:36:43] <Guntanks_in_Space> execution-wise, SCVI is very easy i find @ghostravens
[1:36:46] <+Zubaz> Everyone is fucking cheap in SC6
[1:36:50] <+Okosisi89> Ivy is real good.
[1:36:58] <Guntanks_in_Space> the most complicated you'll get is like Ivy summon suffering stuff
[1:37:00] <+Okosisi89> She used to be way more good.
[1:37:08] <Dragon_Batman> The inputs are easy to get into
[1:37:10] <ghostravens> @Guntanks_in_Space quarter circles? or is it NRS syle like down back etc?
[1:37:13] <Tucker0603> love this game
[1:37:18] <+Okosisi89> Summon suffering is a trick. It's way easier then it looks.
[1:37:20] <Guntanks_in_Space> a bit of both @ghostravens
[1:37:22] <+ThatOneGameTester> oh cool so i could pick her back up then
[1:37:24] <IndoorSitup> Oh that's cool.
[1:37:31] <ghostravens> @Guntanks_in_Space gotcha, thank you
[1:37:40] <Guntanks_in_Space> moves that are just directions + attack, and there's some quarter-circles for some characters like Sophitia for instance and her Angel step
[1:37:55] <Guntanks_in_Space> or say, Astaroth and his Poseidon's Turn/Spin lol
[1:38:07] <Tucker0603> @dsd24 my problem is that the animations look odd on a male character, gonna probably just get used to it.
[1:38:09] <IndoorSitup> Oh that sucks.
[1:38:09] <+Nifkinator> Does this game have online lobbies where multiple people can fight at one time a la guilty gear etc?
[1:38:16] <Guntanks_in_Space> yup there are lobbies
[1:38:22] <SolGoodguy> not like gg
[1:38:31] <SolGoodguy> its there
[1:38:41] <DSD24> @Tucker0603 In that case try Geralt he has some defensive options and his style looks good on all characters
[1:38:43] <JayEarly> I’m not normally into big slow guy with big slow weapon but Astaroth is so fucking cool
[1:38:47] <+Nifkinator> oh so they haven't added simultaneous fights
[1:38:47] <Guntanks_in_Space> though not like GG where all can fight, at least that's what i played lol
[1:38:50] <+Nifkinator> lame
[1:38:59] <SolGoodguy> just don't go on rankeds because namco allowed created characters so its quite of a mess
[1:39:15] <Guntanks_in_Space> though, correct me if i'm wrong but can you set Lobbies to not be king-of-the-hill style?
[1:39:31] <%ChoculaUltra> oof, CaCs are still usable in ranked?
[1:39:34] <IndoorSitup> I ran into an Elon Musk CAS online the other day.
[1:39:38] <Guntanks_in_Space> ye
[1:39:42] <DSD24> @ChoculaUltra Yes
[1:39:51] <Dragon_Batman> Hah didn't know Elon got out so much
[1:39:51] <SolGoodguy> I think you can set the game to swap out the winner if he's dominating
[1:39:58] <SolGoodguy> but I think its primarily koth
[1:40:02] <DSD24> To be fair most of the trolling CAS are gone now
[1:40:09] <+nharliecash> what is this camera set up
[1:40:29] <SolGoodguy> I need to get back to soul cal
[1:40:35] <SolGoodguy> gotta keep practicing my Ivy
[1:41:00] <JayEarly> @dsd24 yeah as long as I can see what your character is doing, it’s fine imo.
[1:41:03] <IndoorSitup> Did you say SIGFRIEEEEEEEEEED?
[1:41:25] <+Polter_ge1st> Man I just want to go on ranked with my Candyman Yoshimitsu
[1:41:28] <+nharliecash> you mean you should block high by default and react to lows
[1:41:39] <SolGoodguy> you can go on ranked with your yoshi
[1:41:46] <SolGoodguy> just don't be the guy with the huge apple model on ranked
[1:41:46] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:41:57] <+Polter_ge1st> Oh yeah huh
[1:42:01] <+Nifkinator> yeah 99% of lows are reactable
[1:42:11] <+Nifkinator> unless it's like mitsu with stalk shaver
[1:42:49] <Guntanks_in_Space> most of my CAS's are character edits....
[1:43:02] <Guntanks_in_Space> like bbhDayo -Astaroth
[1:43:06] <Guntanks_in_Space> ...or Thomas the Train
[1:43:31] <IndoorSitup> The only CAS I have is a Vergil.
[1:43:54] <JayEarly> I like this new age where no game can escape the evil of Thomas The Tank Engine
[1:44:12] <Dragon_Batman> LUL Thomas comin in
[1:44:43] <Tucker0603> damn, need to find the discord then...
[1:44:56] <IndoorSitup> but i don liek discord
[1:45:02] <Guntanks_in_Space> if anyone needs a hook-up on the sieg/nightmare/astaroth discords, let me know and i can toss you guys a link
[1:45:17] <Guntanks_in_Space> that should also reflect what characters i've picked here lol
[1:45:22] <Dragon_Batman> lol
[1:45:50] <JayEarly> You like big men with big weapons I see
[1:45:55] <DSD24> @Guntanks_in_Space Its a good selection of characters
[1:46:10] <IndoorSitup> brb i gotta shower
[1:46:12] <Guntanks_in_Space> i'd join the Sophitia discord too, but i hear not-so-good things about that part of the internet...
[1:46:15] <DeathByPoke7> i use the soul frames app for frame data
[1:46:18] <Zombrocom> On counter you can also do stance A+B
[1:46:20] <Guntanks_in_Space> it may involve people obsessed with feet
[1:46:32] <Guntanks_in_Space> and not like the kindly UNIST folk who love bath water
[1:46:34] <Dragon_Batman> lol
[1:46:38] <fireking900> yo chat who are the guests today?
[1:46:47] <%Johker> Johker subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[1:46:50] <DSD24> @Guntanks_in_Space Hate to say it dude but that's everywhere with pretty characters
[1:46:55] <Zombrocom> I only caught "Mindwolf"
[1:46:55] <+Okosisi89> is aB slide and aGA no longer absolutely required?
[1:46:55] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> someone actually compiled general and character discords for just about every fighting game big enough to have a discord
[1:46:57] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @TURBOSUPLEX3000
[1:47:07] <Dragon_Batman> Toby was the other person I think
[1:47:20] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> ok didnt see that in the rules
[1:47:22] <Zombrocom> You don't NEED them but they are good to have
[1:47:33] <Guntanks_in_Space> ^
[1:47:35] <Zombrocom> Do A+B
[1:47:44] <+Okosisi89> after losing his 6A, i couldn't imagine not having it.
[1:47:55] <Guntanks_in_Space> at the very least, Sieg got improved to a point where he's not overly reliant on slide a:B
[1:48:02] <+Okosisi89> Cool.
[1:48:05] <Guntanks_in_Space> because a few patches ago he was in a bit of a rough place lol
[1:48:16] <Guntanks_in_Space> i still am baffled as to why of all the lows to nerf, it's his 1B
[1:48:20] <+Okosisi89> I fell off the game at launch because I didn't wanna pay for PS+
[1:48:24] <eoniccosta> of all characters to learn as a beginner why x shes so boring
[1:48:41] <DSD24> @Guntanks_in_Space Yeah his pancake throw getting nerfed was dumb
[1:48:53] <+Okosisi89> They nerfed flapjack? how so?
[1:48:54] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:48:55] <%reknownblackcat> reknownblackcat subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[1:49:04] <Guntanks_in_Space> back flapjack is a bit more breakable now
[1:49:13] <Zombrocom> THey nerfed Over Toss to not ring out, then they unnerfed it
[1:49:14] <Guntanks_in_Space> i think in a recent patch they made it so that back flapjack can ring out again
[1:49:20] <DSD24> @Okosisi89 It wouldn't ring out if you did it near the edge
[1:49:20] <%reknownblackcat> reknownblackcat subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! Keep up the good good Woolie!
[1:49:23] <Guntanks_in_Space> but now they made it so that i t can again
[1:49:31] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> does he mean frame traps lol
[1:49:32] <Guntanks_in_Space> but the break timing is a good ways more lenient
[1:49:32] <+Okosisi89> That's atrocious. good that they changed it back
[1:49:36] <+Okosisi89> was it the same on nightmare?
[1:49:41] <Guntanks_in_Space> yes
[1:49:42] <DSD24> @Okosisi89 Yes
[1:49:48] <Guntanks_in_Space> both of their flapjacks were nerfed, but not anymore
[1:50:13] <+Okosisi89> Thank jesus.
[1:50:49] <SomersaultJustice> BK while running
[1:50:53] <PapermanXD> ff b+k
[1:50:54] <Dragon_Batman> That's good they changed that back
[1:51:26] <Guntanks_in_Space> dropkick? it's 44K
[1:52:10] <huskrow> just kidding
[1:52:49] <JayEarly> winky face
[1:52:55] <Guntanks_in_Space> oh yeah off that SBH/Base Hold auto-GI, the B launcher should lethal hit off it
[1:53:05] <Zombrocom> You can tell if it's a counter hit or normal hit based on hit spark colour. At least that's how I do it
[1:53:07] <Guntanks_in_Space> but only if you GI with the stance
[1:53:16] <ghostravens> !uptime
[1:53:17] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 53 minutes
[1:53:43] <Zombrocom> If you do it 9 times, you get into his low health buff mode
[1:53:50] <Zombrocom> I think its 9 now
[1:53:51] <Guntanks_in_Space> wait i thought it was 13 times
[1:53:55] <Guntanks_in_Space> ooooh 9 times now
[1:53:55] <Zombrocom> They buffed it
[1:54:09] <DeathByPoke7> ce also gives you dark legacy stacks
[1:54:10] <Zombrocom> No wait
[1:54:20] <Guntanks_in_Space> CE gives you 6 points iirc
[1:54:28] <Zombrocom> I think it's 12, but super counts as 6 and GI counts as 2?
[1:54:35] <Zombrocom> And whiff is 1
[1:54:37] <Zombrocom> IIRC
[1:55:15] <Dragon_Batman> I didn't play Seig much, didn't realize he had that. Kinda like 2B with her punch build up.
[1:55:32] <Zombrocom> Yeah, a lot of characters have a build up mechanic like that
[1:55:36] <Dragon_Batman> well the dark legacy trigger other than low health
[1:55:40] <ArtThouBored> YO WHAT?! You finally playing SC6?! I gotta get some games with you online
[1:55:43] <Zombrocom> Cervantes and killik and azwel have it
[1:55:58] <ArtThouBored> I gotta clean the rust off my Astaroth
[1:55:58] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:56:01] <Dragon_Batman> Mind if I ask what they are for those guys?
[1:56:08] <+FridayStreamer> sophitia has a thing where if you parry 5 times one of her grabs lethal hit iirc
[1:56:21] <Zombrocom> Auto GI highs and mids, loses to lows
[1:56:37] <eoniccosta> kilik if he lands 4a 4x he gets lh cervantes gets lh on b2 if he gets 9 shots
[1:56:44] <%SkeletoniJabroni> SkeletoniJabroni subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:56:54] <Guntanks_in_Space> two of them actually, and both throws involve her sitting on your face (i.e. 4A+G throw and the running throw)
[1:57:06] <+Okosisi89> hawt.
[1:57:08] <Zombrocom> Right it was cervantes they changed to 9 stacks! That's what mixed me up
[1:57:08] <Guntanks_in_Space> astaroth gets a lethal hit when he rings someone out lol
[1:57:13] <ArtThouBored> Yeah lol
[1:57:24] <+FridayStreamer> its a love grab
[1:57:25] <ArtThouBored> It's best feature of RE imo
[1:57:29] <ArtThouBored> Off ya go!
[1:57:30] <Dragon_Batman> nice
[1:57:33] <eoniccosta> let them try doing aga lol
[1:57:46] <+Okosisi89> aGA is way easier in 6.
[1:57:50] <Guntanks_in_Space> remember in story mode like she tells her husband-to-be that "you like this kinda stuff hon?" when you land that throw on him
[1:57:58] <Guntanks_in_Space> or when you knee his nuts
[1:58:12] <+Okosisi89> I don't remember at all.
[1:58:14] <+Okosisi89> Holy hell.
[1:58:19] <JayEarly> Was it Sophitia or Cassandra in 2 that would sit on your face and be like “Sorry!”?
[1:58:22] <Guntanks_in_Space> Rothion loves CBT confirmed
[1:58:26] <Guntanks_in_Space> @JayEarly Cassandra in 4
[1:58:32] <+FridayStreamer> some of the quotes are mad funny
[1:58:35] <Guntanks_in_Space> who also goes "yo you like this kind of stuff?"
[1:58:41] <DSD24> I am pretty sure Cassandra says this
[1:58:44] <+Okosisi89> Project soul leaning into it hard aren't they?
[1:58:48] <DSD24> During her Critical Art
[1:58:49] <Guntanks_in_Space> while she just gives you ass-based offense with heart cut-ins
[1:59:08] <Guntanks_in_Space> i may or may not have played both alexandra sisters to an extent
[1:59:17] <+FridayStreamer> yeah theres also heart affects during her critical art in 4 i think
[1:59:29] <minicookie713> Are they gonna be lobby matches?
[1:59:41] <Guntanks_in_Space> they're about to i think @minicookie713
[1:59:42] <blue6sub6remnant6> I just showed up and, "Soul Calibur, Neat!"
[1:59:43] <Tucker0603> they on PS4?
[1:59:49] <Guntanks_in_Space> yeh
[1:59:49] <Dragon_Batman> ye
[1:59:51] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 2 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 8oz (240mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[1:59:51] <minicookie713> yes ps4
[1:59:55] <Tucker0603> fack
[2:00:03] <Tucker0603> wanted to fight woolie
[2:00:07] <minicookie713> Thanks @guntanks_in_space
[2:00:13] <Guntanks_in_Space> if it were on PC (and i wasn't at work) i'd love to join in and get washed
[2:00:35] <JayEarly> Xianghua what happened to your clothes
[2:01:21] <DSD24> @JayEarly she got a fatal hit and lost her jacket
[2:01:49] <Belutima> holy audio
[2:01:54] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Where's Woolie today?
[2:02:01] <+FridayStreamer> the meta is to always knock all of mitsurgi's clothes off
[2:02:13] <Guntanks_in_Space> the meta is to not destroy azwell or mitsurugi's pants
[2:02:17] <Guntanks_in_Space> for they are like limiters
[2:02:18] <minicookie713> @fridaystreamer Agreed! those firm bums
[2:02:26] <DSD24> @Guntanks_in_Space Or Astraroths
[2:02:27] <JayEarly> No
[2:02:31] <+FridayStreamer> azwell dupes in tighty whities
[2:02:36] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @Guntanks_in_Space I know I've said it before, but I love your name
[2:02:40] <JayEarly> always destroy Mitsurugi’s pants
[2:02:47] <+blackreaper_k_> U K E M I
[2:02:50] <Guntanks_in_Space> @DSD24 this is why my custom Asta has weird colored trunks JUST FOR THAT PURPOSE
[2:02:56] <Guntanks_in_Space> he is UNHINDERED
[2:03:17] <Guntanks_in_Space> @Admiral_PopnFresh yeah i vaguely remember that lol, thanks!
[2:03:17] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:03:24] <DSD24> @Guntanks_in_Space I have a lot of alts for Astra so he can still look cool with broken armor
[2:03:39] <eoniccosta> easier to do guard and direction
[2:04:09] <minicookie713> !schedule
[2:04:09] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[2:04:23] <eldragon_1> who are the two experts today?

[2:06:36] <mftechodrone> Damn
[2:06:45] <mistersups> I think there sould be a STREAMER mode for room creation
[2:06:47] <+Okosisi89> "How do you get up so fast!" is the question I get asked the most.
[2:07:00] <SomersaultJustice> surprise it's minh
[2:07:00] <+NovaKnightmare> I may not have the game but Im happy to watch
[2:07:25] <CynicalKirby> Is this on ps4?

[2:08:15] <Guntanks_in_Space> is Color 4 the SC2 P1 colors?
[2:08:20] <Guntanks_in_Space> then it's easily the best pick
[2:08:20] <+FloorBurger> got em
[2:08:23] <minicookie713> Buuuuuurn
[2:08:25] <JayEarly> I do like clothing damage ranges from something subtle like losing a shoulder pauldron to “oh my god my pants exploded”
[2:08:25] <ArtThouBored> Okay
[2:08:32] <Guntanks_in_Space> i would have liked Green Asta (P3) but the scar isn't red so no go
[2:08:34] <%mh9s> 2P Kreygasm
[2:08:50] <SomersaultJustice> now feel the terror of fighting against 2B online
[2:08:51] <ArtThouBored> Color 4 isn't tan enough on my screen
[2:08:55] <Dragon_Batman> I know when 2B came out I had to give her that T shirt she never got
[2:09:27] <blue6sub6remnant6> @Dragon_Batman Literally a hero.

[2:12:09] <Zombrocom> I am sad you didn't do the counter, but gg
[2:12:19] <DSD24> Valkyrie Tira
[2:12:32] <ArtThouBored> Oh so this is like Tekken 7 I gotta time my refresh to find you
[2:12:37] <FrustratedAF> its a waifu dress-up fighting game. why doesn't this sell better?
[2:12:55] <Dragon_Batman> not enough breasts?
[2:12:58] <Guntanks_in_Space> @Irridium 2Butt has been enjoyed immensely
[2:13:01] <FrustratedAF> IVY IS RIGHT THERE
[2:13:02] <ArtThouBored> Name Recognition isn't as big as SF or MK
[2:13:04] <Dragon_Batman> too much fighting?
[2:13:04] <DSD24> Uh Ivy exists
[2:13:05] <ArtThouBored> or Tekken
[2:13:06] <JayEarly> This game apparently did well for Namco
[2:13:13] <ArtThouBored> ^
[2:13:15] <serrule1> Hey Woolie! Did either you our Pat catch the All In wrestling show?
[2:13:27] <+FridayStreamer> yeah i heard it sold decent
[2:13:27] <Guntanks_in_Space> oh man that SBH K should have followed with SBH A+B lol
[2:13:42] <Dragon_Batman> Ivy holdin it down but maybe people want more?
[2:13:49] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Who's playing Tira?
[2:13:55] <DSD24> Ivy and Tira are in this game
[2:14:00] <Zombrocom> Yeah, well this is like woolies day 1 seig
[2:14:10] <Guntanks_in_Space> he'll get there!
[2:14:12] <DSD24> Sorry I mean Taki
[2:14:17] <Dragon_Batman> I love this game. I'm just throwing out possible ideas
[2:14:18] <Zombrocom> I doubt he knows that move exists
[2:14:25] <%Solidnick18> 👀
[2:14:25] <+Evitron1> i dont remember this part of dark souls 3
[2:14:26] <JayEarly> This, Ace Combat and fuckin Jump Force all did good for Namco
[2:14:26] <Guntanks_in_Space> yo Tira counts for the fanservice factor too
[2:14:29] <Guntanks_in_Space> she's oddly popular
[2:14:32] <@Menitta> man I wish I had my copy
[2:14:33] <%KingLlama1> where did all her clothes go ?
[2:14:34] <Guntanks_in_Space> (and i don't question it)
[2:14:36] <FrustratedAF> tira is totally fanservice
[2:14:36] <+Polter_ge1st> A Tale of Two Swords
[2:14:40] <Dragon_Batman> I really like Tira in this game
[2:14:44] <Guntanks_in_Space> Sieg blew up her clothes with his BIG LONG SWORD
[2:15:00] <Zombrocom> Tira has an rng based infinite (during soul charge) it's nutty
[2:15:03] <Dragon_Batman> She never stood out to me in the past ones tho
[2:15:25] <JayEarly> @zombrocom wha
[2:15:46] <Dragon_Batman> dam does she? I know she can randomly switch depending on her moves, I think
[2:15:51] <ArtThouBored> Oh man I really hope I don't fight Reggie again
[2:15:56] <mistersups> Indianapolis
[2:16:00] <SomersaultJustice> what if he was just born on 3/17?
[2:16:09] <ArtThouBored> It'll look like I'm hunting for him at this point lol
[2:16:10] <Guntanks_in_Space> if you get lucky on your Jolly/Gloomy mode switch you can practically loop her headbutt into grinder move
[2:16:27] <blue6sub6remnant6> Gotta protect that cornfield I guess.
[2:16:27] <Dragon_Batman> hah that's pretty great
[2:16:29] <Guntanks_in_Space> though it scales heavily at some point
[2:16:30] <%Solidnick18> lol
[2:16:31] <Zombrocom> As long as she personality swaps every time you do headbutt
[2:16:43] <Zombrocom> Does like 3 damage a hit but it's hilarious
[2:16:44] <Dragon_Batman> most infinites do tho right?
[2:16:49] <Guntanks_in_Space> yup
[2:17:06] <eoniccosta> he’s b4 with what charCter
[2:17:16] <%KingLlama1> followed him out ... respect

[2:19:36] <ArtThouBored> Other Regions or Same Region?
[2:19:46] <Zombrocom> I have scaled cervantes super down to a grand total of 3 damage
[2:19:55] <Zombrocom> Scaling is intense in this game
[2:20:04] <SomersaultJustice> can xianghua still GI into super or did that get removed?
[2:20:13] <MutedMimic> PogChamp
[2:20:15] <%shmupdogjoe> well, *I* wanted to hear about tech traps...

[3:08:57] <SomersaultJustice> Gnome more Gnomes
[3:09:04] <Matrixvingian> Almost bedtime men!

[3:13:34] <Matrixvingian> MAn Anarchy Reigns for Switch even would be amazing.
[3:13:41] <+DukeMoose> so its not gothic lolitia its just lolitiam
[3:13:43] <+Okosisi89> Will there ever be a get into skullgirls? or did it happen and I missed it?

[3:14:04] <FrustratedAF> @Okosisi89 woolie needs a local player to come by for it as a guest. which he can't find.
[3:14:10] <@Menitta> i'd play anarchy. i own 2 copies for whatever reason
[3:14:10] <+Okosisi89> Shame.
[3:14:11] <%Solidnick18> yep
[3:14:27] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> the real question is Will there be a Get Into Indivisible?

[0:11:00] <Safarihat> @Ashenik1 lul we are about halfway
[0:11:03] <%WanderingSwordsman> yo what's is this song?
[0:11:08] <Safarihat> soon is relative
[0:11:17] <%WanderingSwordsman> *what is
[0:11:20] <Ashenik1> @Safarihat so an endgame
[0:11:30] <T_Doobie> @WanderingSwordsman maya's theme in KI
[0:11:35] <esetremendo> I want Woolie play Revelaitons: Persona
[0:12:05] <goodakuma> My Persona is Kanye
[0:12:08] <DatAsuna> marc started dancing crazy
[0:12:19] <Safarihat> has woolie ever played the trails in the sky trilogy?
[0:12:23] <DatAsuna> I want woolie to play persona 2: eternal punishment
[0:12:29] <esetremendo> @goodakuma respec
[0:12:40] <DatAsuna> aka the only non high school persona
[0:12:50] <esetremendo> Mark danced crazy!
[0:13:06] <esetremendo> P2 EP is beautiful
[0:13:09] <goodakuma> Gotta love Japan and their High Schools
[0:13:18] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Also for some reason lately My PC doesnt save my site logins anymore
[0:13:21] <Ashenik1> Like Woolie is willing to experiment so I hope he will give a witcher game a try. He really enjoys soundtrack of the 3rd one but never played any game so maybe...
[0:13:21] <esetremendo> Sucks we never got psp version
[0:13:45] <DatAsuna> agreed
[0:13:45] <Eger007> atlus p2 remake pls
[0:13:56] <Safarihat> man the ki soundtrack is just hype
[0:13:56] <vulkan_vibes> would woolie stream P5? Can you even?
[0:14:00] <RantingRavager> Not sure how good a Witcher 3 game would be to stream, but LP might be fine
[0:14:13] <DatAsuna> Oh it would be way better to stream than LP
[0:14:16] <esetremendo> @vulkan_vibes maybe not vanilla?
[0:14:20] <DatAsuna> witcher 3 has a lot of horse riding time
[0:14:20] <esetremendo> i dunno
[0:14:24] <lotharrio> Witcher 3 is lengthy, and a fair bit of it is grind.
[0:14:35] <DatAsuna> You need a sidecar person who can fill a lot of dead air for witcher 3
[0:14:36] <+Zayasu> @vulkan_vibes yeah you can but he already said he doesn't wanna go through it again
[0:14:43] <+oda_flobunaga> as long as its is not Witcher 1
[0:14:55] <Ashenik1> @RantingRavager IF not Witcher 3 then Thronbreaker, the same quality of writing and it takes like 20-30 hours to play. Also Gewnt is fun
[0:14:56] <+oda_flobunaga> ThroneBreaker might be interesting to stream
[0:15:08] <DatAsuna> Imagine being pat and thinking witcher 1 is better than the books
[0:15:08] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:15:11] <lotharrio> See a card game, he'd probably be up for.
[0:15:18] <DatAsuna> the books he didn't read, but watched the netflix show
[0:15:20] <vulkan_vibes> @zayasu apparently you can't stream past in game date 11/19
[0:15:21] <RantingRavager> As long as the dynamic of talking about random shit and getting hype for card games is there
[0:15:28] <RantingRavager> it should be fine
[0:15:33] <+projectmanatees> how many hoes will get mad today
[0:15:39] <DatAsuna> As an edited video
[0:15:46] <DatAsuna> but even if you take every chance to pla gwent you can
[0:15:50] <superelitejimi> this song is fire
[0:15:55] <DatAsuna> gwent is still only like 3% of the game at best
[0:16:01] <+Zayasu> @vulkan_vibes im watching multiple streamers play it and also saw a lot streamers complete the original. nothing happened.
[0:16:13] <vulkan_vibes> stream gwent for mobile
[0:16:16] <AnacondaVirtue> Ultraaaaaaaaaaaa
[0:16:17] <%kapcommunist> im smacking my big belly in time with this song
[0:16:19] <Ashenik1> I mean world ,characters and dialogue are very enjoyable so I guess Woolie should like it IDK ;d
[0:16:26] <+Tk254> what the fuck is that song
[0:16:27] <%gatorafan> Local man is constantly wrong but is very loud so... Who knows?
[0:16:33] <DatAsuna> He probably would enjoy it yeah
[0:16:56] <vulkan_vibes> @zayasu the anime police may take their time, but they have never failed a mission
[0:16:59] <%Reverend_Roscoe> I'm so glad my Starguments comment stuck lol
[0:16:59] <RantingRavager> But the Local man was both hot and had a bad past so...
[0:17:00] <esetremendo> I want Woolie play Mr. Domino
[0:17:03] <Robot_Nixon_> that pixel woolie dancing would make a fine BTTV emote.. 😡
[0:17:05] <DatAsuna> I jsut think it would be an LP that would need a guest co-host
[0:17:15] <%gatorafan> CAN YOU FEEL IT? daedra1DrunkTibs
[0:17:18] <DatAsuna> someone who can talk a lot about witcher when woolie has to just rid ea horse for 10 minutes
[0:17:20] <%gatorafan> SourPls
[0:17:28] <+oda_flobunaga> The issue with FTP Gwent is the number of cards/ deckbuilding
[0:17:30] <+projectmanatees> @Robot_Nixon_ think of all the BBTV emotes we could have FeelsBadMan
[0:17:32] <Robot_Nixon_> why dont they embrace BTTV emotes FeelsBadMan
[0:17:36] <RantingRavager> FeelsBadMan

[0:19:18] <%gatorafan> I don't get this convo, I'm using Frankerfacer daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:19:21] <RantingRavager> tbf, Pat lives with the closest thing to Triss so he might be a bit biased
[0:19:24] <%deviljhojho_> KOTOR BABY
[0:19:25] <esetremendo> samurai woolie lookin like a boss
[0:19:36] <+Tk254> I see all these cgaractet designs and then i remember woolir is a real person and i get real hype
[0:19:40] <Ashenik1> Yen is the ultimate TOP in the realtionship, I guess Pat doesnt like to feel small

[0:22:14] <Chisas_Dead_Body> Sand tho
[0:22:19] <RantingRavager> BlessRNG <---- Kind of looks like V, ngl
[0:22:21] <Ashenik1> I think sex with game Triss is vanilla, Yen however is the adventure to the unchurted teritoris
[0:22:22] <+Tk254> Did you read the Star Wars James Bond Comic?
[0:22:30] <1matheuw> yeyeye ibe hour of talking
[0:22:38] <goodakuma> the NEGA-CHIN
[0:22:41] <$realm_forge> The Vader comics are awesome
[0:22:43] <DatAsuna> "but saaaaand"
[0:22:45] <lotharrio> Does this run include the lab tech that wants Vader to be her husbando?
[0:23:03] <+oda_flobunaga> People who like Triss have not read the books/ don't care about that stuff
[0:23:08] <+Tk254> THE BLUE JEANS WITH THE DARK ROBE
[0:23:10] <Ashenik1> @WoolieVersus is Vader among your favourite villains ?
[0:23:12] <RantingRavager> Wait, aren't there tie-ins to the main Star Wars comics there? I recall having to hunt down for some arcs
[0:23:14] <esetremendo> is it wrong idgaf about star wars?
[0:23:21] <+Tk254> Tk254 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:23:22] <%GeneralSCPatton> What is all this talk of a nega-chin?
[0:23:26] <DatAsuna> @oda_flobunaga or they work at cd_projekt lol
[0:23:35] <derap41> Anakin being a awkward shit in the movies is deliberate in the same way Peter Parker is an awkward shit in Spider Man 3
[0:23:38] <RantingRavager> @esetremendo it's okay to like anything as long as you don't force your opinons on other people
[0:23:52] <goodakuma> @esetremendo like new movies or new in general
[0:23:56] <gandalfsmagicgaydick> Hey all, how's it going?
[0:24:07] <Ashenik1> @derap41 naaaaah I would say bad writing/directing
[0:24:13] <+PapaGravestone> N*ga-Chin SwiftRage
[0:24:14] <DatAsuna> Yup
[0:24:15] <esetremendo> @rantingravager true
[0:24:29] <london_flexing> @esetremendo no. you CAN force your opinion. lol Ryan Johnson already has
[0:24:29] <esetremendo> @goodakuma the whole thing
[0:24:31] <RantingRavager> but having a moderate opinion isn't fun to have and is bad content
[0:24:36] <goodakuma> damn
[0:24:41] <DatAsuna> She mostly just hangs out in the back
[0:24:47] <RantingRavager> so allow me to retort... You swine, how dare you not like star wars
[0:24:50] <RantingRavager> debate me shitlord
[0:24:52] <esetremendo> isn't the force a bunch of bacteria?
[0:24:53] <derap41> @Ashenik1 Its hard to pull of being Awkward without comming off as awkward
[0:24:58] <+PapaGravestone> PapaGravestone subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:25:03] <+oda_flobunaga> How would Vader react if sand got in his suit?
[0:25:05] <+aishman> aishman subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! 18 months of pure fighting game HYPE. Also I recommend reading the Dr. Aphra comics, those are REAL good too and run parallel to the Darth Vader comics where she's introduced. I forget if that's this run or the last one.
[0:25:13] <%Tk254> Dark Lord Vee and Darth Wuul, names that would strike fear into all hypocritical jedi scum that hold the galaxy hostage.
[0:25:18] <goodakuma> All Women are Queens
[0:25:25] <RantingRavager> All Men are Simps
[0:25:28] <%BallerSwagBro9k> U rly should stream Fallen Order soon
[0:25:36] <UberKingKai> woolieLORE
[0:25:37] <$realm_forge> t101WE t101HAVE
[0:25:45] <superelitejimi> ayyy bunny butt
[0:25:50] <derap41> No one knows Vader once shat his pants infront of his GF
[0:25:52] <%Tk254> Simping for Wuul and Vee
[0:25:53] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @realm_forge HMMMMMM OMOSHIROI
[0:25:55] <lotharrio> Like the fifth Sith that Palpatine pulled out in a decade.
[0:25:56] <$realm_forge> I did that on accident
[0:26:04] <$realm_forge> I swear
[0:26:04] <london_flexing> @goodakuma If she breaths she's a THOT!
[0:26:12] <%BisoromiBear> BisoromiBear is continuing the Gift Sub they got from Kazuhira_Boat! 
[0:26:23] <austinj24> if she breathes-fuck beat me to it
[0:26:27] <%Gruhunchously> He's kind of hard to miss, guys
[0:26:28] <esetremendo> Queens are all THOTs
[0:26:30] <goodakuma> @london_flexing AAHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!
[0:26:30] <Halospaz117> The best part is that clone commander was a fucking asshole
[0:26:33] <+evbites> Oh shit it's vader if only skywalker was here
[0:26:35] <vulkan_vibes> OF HE VENTILATE
[0:26:41] <+oda_flobunaga> @DatAsuna Book Triss is fine but game Triss is borderline psychopathic in her Geralt simping.
[0:26:41] <%spacehouse> Isn't it heavily implied that the mon cala Jedi used force hypnosis on his followers?
[0:26:43] <vulkan_vibes> IF HE VENTILATE*
[0:26:52] <Ashenik1> @derap41 I mean if movies were good then yeah I gues it he was meant to be that way. But everything in prequals doesnt work so why should Anakins awkwardness be seen as deliberate
[0:27:18] <goodakuma> What If Anakin liked Sand?
[0:27:27] <DatAsuna> @oda_flobunaga well if you go by the woolie definition of psychotic, everyone is :P

[0:28:19] <derap41> @Ashenik1 That strange reasoning
[0:28:21] <DatAsuna> I've been rereading the jedi academy books lately too and BOY do those get weird
[0:28:26] <%Tk254> Why are they called Moffs? -Because they follow the Light.... -sabers.
[0:28:34] <%Gruhunchously> "I've got VADER on it, ugh, just saying his name stresses my ass"
[0:28:47] <akman14> Do those comics have the female simp fangirl of vader?
[0:28:48] <Robot_Nixon_> General Tso? Kreygasm
[0:29:01] <+oda_flobunaga> @Ashenik1 I know right! But she's hot so shes morally grey.
[0:29:02] <DatAsuna> Tarkin krennic and thrawn have a bunch of middle manager drama that undermines them yeah
[0:29:07] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus The jungle stuff is from the book that's all about him.
[0:29:11] <DatAsuna> It's a lot of those three arguing over budgets
[0:29:11] <Dangerzone979> Sounds like the Jungle bit was just Vader Enrichment, like a hedgehog with a tube
[0:29:46] <+evbites> Tarkin:fuck you ya dumbass wizard
[0:29:46] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:29:47] <%RioGascar> i wonder if grand moff and thrawn ever had a battle where they had to work together
[0:29:50] <Ashenik1> @derap41 IDK man everything is boring and awkward about prequels. Was all of it meant to be that way?
[0:29:51] <Tucker0603> @WoolieVersus i still prefer the EU's Death Star Designer, A naive fool who designed so many deadly planet killing weapons FOR NON MURDERING REASONS
[0:29:51] <1matheuw> wat
[0:29:51] <%BallerSwagBro9k> cmonBruh
[0:29:59] <%RioGascar> Feels like they would not get along

[0:30:01] <lotharrio> Spacist
[0:30:06] <vulkan_vibes> the Verpine?
[0:30:06] <%xcompleasedad> xcompleasedad subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak! The Empire is evil? Color me shocked.
[0:30:12] <Ashenik1> Speciest
[0:30:13] <%BallerSwagBro9k> CERBERUS
[0:30:14] <Tucker0603> Xenophobic
[0:30:18] <+Zanco23> Weren't the Sith a different species?
[0:30:18] <superelitejimi> ...are people in star wars humans, orrr..?
[0:30:19] <%gatorafan> Do you know where Vader got his X Pass?
[0:30:20] <DatAsuna> Nah V, the republic was already just less racist but still racist
[0:30:20] <Psyramics> Misogynist too
[0:30:21] <alexandrecau> I mean the Emperor likely don't like the blacks either
[0:30:23] <+griffball13> WHO BEEN FUCKING
[0:30:24] <Ashenik1> Xenophobix is about nationality

[0:30:27] <Halospaz117> @lotharrio Spacist just make me think of a bunch of Star Destroyers shooting at space cuz they hate it
[0:30:34] <DatAsuna> Obi-wan in the requels dropping a lot of lowkey racism lol
[0:30:34] <Dangerzone979> @Zanco23 A long time ago they were
[0:30:37] <UberKingKai> Ah breakfast
[0:30:37] <andrei11dr> Oh shit MO KOTOR MO PROBLEMS PogChamp
[0:30:48] <1matheuw> oh shit
[0:30:53] <derap41> @Ashenik1 no but Anakin was meant to be Awkward in those scenes just because they didn't do a good job with it doesn't mean they didn't have an idea with it
[0:30:58] <%RioGascar> Wait palp is from naboo
[0:31:02] <DatAsuna> And the whole "There's humans and then there's ALIENS" thing is always a bit racist in any star wars thing. lol
[0:31:02] <Ashenik1> @oda_flobunaga And she has big tities so for me she is morarly greenish
[0:31:03] <%Castle_Kundarak> It's where Vader was born, imo. So it makes sense.
[0:31:10] <notenoughgirls> palp was the senator of naboo in e1
[0:31:12] <%Tk254> VADER BEATS UP THE PLANET FOR TAKING HIS LEGS

[0:31:57] <+evbites> it's a place that got some force shit
[0:31:59] <+oda_flobunaga> Fuck Triss, in a pejorative/totally non-sexual way...

[0:32:24] <donstylo> Sith Caves are like Man Caves, places full of regret.
[0:32:28] <derap41> @Ashenik1 Sure I never said they did a good job with I said they planned for him to be that way just they failed their execution
[0:32:36] <+oda_flobunaga> @BallerSwagBro9k yeah
[0:32:38] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @alrobot2014 oh yeah I just finished the rewatch

[0:33:34] <%samspam999> psaLiz
[0:33:37] <%Merhabi> Lets get it going bro, this weeks assigned reading Star Wars: Kanan
[0:33:39] <+hojynn> Sith are not part of the Ethernet Elite
[0:33:48] <+oda_flobunaga> HORCRUXES
[0:33:51] <%GeneralSCPatton> AREA 51 IS BUILT ON A DARK PLACE
[0:33:53] <Dangerzone979> IIRC a lot of the Sith magic stuff originated from the Orginal species right? and the dark jedi melded it with the dark side force powers?
[0:33:54] <Nested_Dreams> Question: how far away is the current KOTOR manga from the Anime release?
[0:33:56] <StarlitStunner> Momon?
[0:33:56] <%samspam999> woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:33:58] <AMaidIndeed> Force Lich
[0:34:02] <%spacehouse> Sith Enlightenment is a concept not explored enough
[0:34:11] <KaiserMario> Jack of Blades?
[0:34:13] <%Tk254> The Washington Monument was built ontop of a Sith Cave to keep Lincoln contained in his Statue
[0:34:15] <DatAsuna> @Dangerzone979 Nah the original dark jedi brought alchemy to the species
[0:34:16] <vulkan_vibes> so he's captain ginyu?
[0:34:19] <%Zohare> @Nested_Dreams About a stream
[0:34:19] <+jumbey234> Doctor fate
[0:34:22] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @nested_dreams like one or two eps?
[0:34:23] <derap41> Isn't Palpatine an Arch Litch?
[0:34:24] <%Merhabi> Force Ghost
[0:34:25] <esetremendo> SW is such a Kingdom Hearts ripoff
[0:34:27] <Ashenik1> @derap41 I thought you were defending the execution :p Then yeah I guess it was meant to be awkward, but I still would prefer Clone Wars anakin. Sometimes I wish they would redo Revenage of the Sith in animation.
[0:34:27] <$realm_forge> It’s a horcrux
[0:34:30] <%Gruhunchously> One Hungry Boi
[0:34:38] <DatAsuna> Also you met a coule of force ghosts
[0:34:38] <Dangerzone979> @DatAsuna oh damn, I stand corrected
[0:34:40] <goodakuma> Kirby is a Sith?
[0:34:50] <vulkan_vibes> CAPTAIN GINYU VOLDEMORT
[0:34:52] <SubtleAddict> lich king?
[0:34:55] <+DorianCreed> They need to recanonise Revan and the Sith Lords from KOTOR2
[0:34:55] <+evbites> also once again darth vader is an angry cyborg zombie
[0:34:57] <%GeneralSCPatton> Hungry boi just has a giant aura that inflicts negative levels
[0:34:58] <%Tk254> Hungryboi is an active Lich, he doesn't have a Phylactery
[0:35:00] <+oda_flobunaga> What happens if you make a droid wear it?
[0:35:07] <notenoughgirls> so how does the episode 9 sith eternal fit into all this
[0:35:11] <Nested_Dreams> @zohare @reverend_roscoe Thanks, I'll stay then
[0:35:13] <%spacehouse> Heretic of Sith AND Jedi
[0:35:15] <andrei11dr> Man ,Scifi + magic is probably my favorite tipe of setting
[0:35:15] <%Merhabi> We have ghosts in the story, I think we can do whatever
[0:35:18] <JetpackMcQuack> KomodoHype the force!
[0:35:21] <Ashenik1> Wait are the ONES Gods in Star Wars or just very buffy aliens?
[0:35:27] <%MrRabbles> lich
[0:35:28] <DatAsuna> @Dangerzone979 the sith species bread with the jedi real heavy real long ago tho so the rate of force sensitivity among them is super high.
[0:35:35] <esetremendo> wasn't darth maul in insidious?
[0:35:39] <DatAsuna> It's more rare to not be a force sensitive sith.
[0:35:41] <%Tk254> LORD VEE AND DARTH WUUL
[0:35:59] <DatAsuna> The muur talisman
[0:36:08] <goodakuma> @esetremendo that was his force ghost
[0:36:11] <%Gruhunchously> Uh...
[0:36:14] <DatAsuna> The legacy comics did it
[0:36:18] <$realm_forge> Imagine a with possessed lightsaber that constantly yells at you
[0:36:18] <Dangerzone979> @DatAsuna Right, that's what had me confused on the lore
[0:36:19] <%Zohare> @Nested_Dreams They're a little bit into Dantooine if you're interested
[0:36:20] <DatAsuna> the ktor comics did it
[0:36:25] <DatAsuna> the tales of the jedi comics did it
[0:36:35] <%Merhabi> woolieVS Comic Books
[0:36:37] <derap41> Chaos Corruption?
[0:36:44] <JetpackMcQuack> kinamaHype
[0:36:46] <%Tk254> wooliePOYO
[0:36:46] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[0:37:03] <+evbites> vader:you have to beat them
[0:37:11] <andrei11dr> Don't forget about the Sith copter
[0:37:17] <%MrRabbles> vader swings first
[0:37:21] <%BisoromiBear> Woolie VS is my favorite Star Wars podcast
[0:37:23] <goodakuma> Chaos Control?
[0:37:27] <derap41> Isn't Love a really positive Sith thing like its a super strong emotional fuel
[0:37:37] <+Zanco23> Can you buy these comics on Kindle, so we can see the stuff you're talking about?
[0:37:41] <ZeeJiggle> Aw man Fallen Order is so good. We should play Fallen Order.
[0:37:51] <DatAsuna> I would be down for a fallen order LP
[0:37:53] <%Merhabi> Love should be the strongest sith fuel, it's forbidden by the light side Jedi
[0:37:55] <+oda_flobunaga> Yeah, obsessive love is super destructive
[0:37:57] <%Gruhunchously> This Twi'lek is the wrong color
[0:37:57] <%Tk254> WOOLIE LOOKING FOR A TOMBOY SITH GF
[0:37:58] <$realm_forge> Her fight was fun
[0:37:59] <%Merhabi> Black skinned thing?
[0:38:06] <%DemonOfSalt> @derap41 Yes, but most Sith have a misguided negative view about love.
[0:38:16] <andrei11dr> cmonBruh
[0:38:17] <JetpackMcQuack> Star wars could be so cool
[0:38:17] <DatAsuna> sigh
[0:38:18] <vulkan_vibes> yes
[0:38:18] <+mechslayer71> Black skinned thing PogChamp
[0:38:19] <OverlordLuna> cmonBruh
[0:38:22] <DatAsuna> yeah BF2 has movie setup
[0:38:24] <+captain_history> yeah, everything not being the movies is pretty decent
[0:38:31] <DatAsuna> BF2 sets up the exegol compass .etc
[0:38:32] <abelincoln_catpuncher> speak the TRUTH, Master V
[0:38:33] <$GabeSweetMan> It's a SHAME there's not enough material to base the movies on! LUL
[0:38:34] <vulkan_vibes> I was impressed by the BF2 story
[0:38:41] <DatAsuna> and has luke's ach-to comass
[0:38:46] <%OldManDeckardCain> I can't believe woolie is racist to black people like paige is sexist to other women NotLikeThis
[0:38:46] <+oda_flobunaga> Highest levels care about MONAY
[0:38:49] <derap41> @DemonOfSalt I mean its kinda hard to find love when you're kinda turning into a psychopath
[0:38:53] <DatAsuna> but also fuck operation cinder
[0:38:55] <abelincoln_catpuncher> Yeah the story of the 501st is really well done
[0:38:58] <%Merhabi> Woolie really jumps straight to depersoning those filthy aliens
[0:39:06] <DatAsuna> It's actually not lol
[0:39:06] <%Merhabi> Respect
[0:39:12] <TheVoltStrike> i legit dreamed episode 9 never happened and the last movie was still being produced
[0:39:13] <JetpackMcQuack> The inquisitors just kinsda crept into cannon from the background
[0:39:15] <%Irridium> mid-tier is probably less resources so less executive meddling. At least that's what I assume
[0:39:20] <TheVoltStrike> i think i gotta let go
[0:39:22] <DatAsuna> They've had a few non-sith dark side groups before
[0:39:31] <Ashenik1> is Mandalorian Seires mid-tier ??
[0:39:35] <DatAsuna> clone wars has the dar acolytes .etc
[0:39:37] <derap41> Somewhere people cared
[0:39:38] <%DemonOfSalt> @derap41 Yup, most Sith do the mistake of 100% Dark Side as opposed to a more reasonable LS-DS ratio.
[0:39:52] <+captain_history> Mandalorian is Filoni, Filoni knows what he is doing
[0:40:04] <%Merhabi> 70/30 DL ratio
[0:40:09] <%Tk254> THE JEDI FACTORY
[0:40:12] <+Zanco23> It feels like it goes against the rule of two though.
[0:40:16] <andrei11dr> And then the new movies happened and they didn't say "let's not fuck this up"
[0:40:17] <DatAsuna> Actually the perfect weapon against a jedi is doubt. :P
[0:40:23] <%DemonOfSalt> @derap41 I feel like Darth Revan is one of the very few that realized 100% DS is unsustainable.
[0:40:46] <%spacehouse> Rule of Two is a stupid rule
[0:40:47] <goodakuma> He is the fucking strong
[0:40:52] <Ashenik1> I am surrended by dead men.
[0:40:53] <derap41> Mandalorian hasn't really had enough time to be tiered Season 1 is like a 7 out of 10
[0:40:57] <+evbites> i love in fallen order you feel like a big hero then at the end you get put back in your place
[0:41:04] <DatAsuna> Yeah bane was a hilariously short sighted
[0:41:05] <+captain_history> @Zanco23 The whole point is that they aren't Sith. They are disposable force users.
[0:41:07] <+Taglog7> Jeans with Jedi top? Immersion broken.
[0:41:16] <$GabeSweetMan> But PASSION is strong in the Dark Side! That's just Vader being a salty fuck lol.
[0:41:27] <+Zanco23> It's kind of weird that Luke is able to beat Vader, based on how they've established him as being unbeatable now.
[0:41:30] <derap41> @DemonOfSalt Yeah but I mean its a bit like only using some meth
[0:41:32] <DatAsuna> Bane's entire idea was to learn everything you can THEN kill your teacher. But then he gets mad at his apprentice for not killing him because he hadn't taught her everything.
[0:41:40] <%RioGascar> so there is an issue i feel would happen. if vader is so powerful...how is there conflict in the comic?
[0:41:44] <Ashenik1> Should Filoni get control over the franchise then?
[0:41:58] <+Goblin01> this is sooo much more healthy thank talking about this with pat...
[0:41:58] <DatAsuna> hell portal
[0:41:59] <%RioGascar> Like if theres no sense of danger why should i be invested
[0:42:01] <+Proxzo> Isn't Vadar basically a force mutant? He's like freakishly strong.
[0:42:03] <DatAsuna> Hell exists in star wars
[0:42:05] <lotharrio> Star Wars has Hell.
[0:42:06] <derap41> 5th dimention
[0:42:07] <%Merhabi> you're reviewing the comic spoil it
[0:42:08] <DatAsuna> It's just called hell
[0:42:10] <akman14> Whatever the plot needs
[0:42:11] <DatAsuna> sometimes chaos
[0:42:13] <%spacehouse> interdimensional force portal
[0:42:15] <fist_wizard_jay> Yooo just finished catching up with the Doom manga
[0:42:15] <+evbites> @Zanco23 I think it's implied vader was just done with everything
[0:42:15] <%MrRabbles> Space Hades
[0:42:18] <derap41> Its the Warp
[0:42:19] <%Merhabi> H'ell
[0:42:22] <lotharrio> Han Solo just yells, "I'll see you in Hell!"
[0:42:22] <andrei11dr> And then Doomguy was there
[0:42:23] <alexandrecau> Vader is strong but he is still a handicapped man with a deasth wish, he can still get fucked
[0:42:23] <+oda_flobunaga> the realm of the WHILLS
[0:42:23] <%Theycallmenerf> Doomslayer rips and tears his way into Star Wars
[0:42:24] <%GeneralSCPatton> I always assumed that the afterlife was like the Lifestream
[0:42:33] <derap41> Yeah that is the Warp
[0:42:48] <alexandrecau> Like most comic issues has him losing limbs or shit
[0:42:49] <%Tk254> ARE YOU TELLING ME COULD HAVE GOTTEN DARTH SLAYER IN SITH ETERNAL!!!??!?

[0:45:22] <Ashenik1> Star Wars is about family.
[0:45:23] <%Gruhunchously> That was in the old canon though
[0:45:28] <$GabeSweetMan> I was saying Boo-urns.
[0:45:29] <+evbites> Fuckin Sheeve
[0:45:40] <joshua_42> It’s about family
[0:45:41] <derap41> Palpatine Shot his space spluge and impregnated half the galaxy
[0:45:42] <$realm_forge> Palatine went on a hell of a hot streak before phantom menace
[0:45:43] <%deviljhojho_> star wars is about accidental incest

[0:45:59] <ZeeJiggle> Palpatine used the Sith Branded Turkey Baster
[0:46:01] <DatAsuna> Well old canon was palpatine failed to make the sith chosen and then the force made the ANTI-sith chosen one to say screw you
[0:46:06] <notenoughgirls> i dont get why the palpatine midichlorian dad thing has blown up so much recently. wasnt it basically the same in legends?

[0:52:58] <SereneFox> So what I'm beginning to understand is there is literally no chill in the Star Wars Universe ever.
[0:53:00] <DatAsuna> That comic came out post snips
[0:53:10] <DatAsuna> I read that as no chilli
[0:53:14] <DatAsuna> and that was even worse
[0:53:15] <%Tk254> are the sith lords reading the chat?
[0:53:15] <notenoughgirls> snips is corny but its not nearly as bad a skyguy

[0:53:31] <%Gruhunchously> What about the droid attack on the Wookiees?
[0:53:42] <DatAsuna> The grievous fight is also dumb when kenobi has been fighting and beating him for years

[0:54:14] <+Zanco23> That's why I don't read anything in between the movies, just the stuff before and after.
[0:54:17] <DatAsuna> but is he a simp lord?
[0:54:19] <grandark_z317> a *SITH* *LORD?*
[0:54:21] <+oda_flobunaga> @WoolieVersus Jedi are wise not smart
[0:54:24] <%Gruhunchously> Maul ain't a Sith Lord though
[0:54:26] <DatAsuna> She's not
[0:54:26] <%spacehouse> Sloppy Planning
[0:54:26] <vulkan_vibes> maybe they just knew maul was the apprentice
[0:54:27] <%andrex2311> schrodinger's Maul
[0:54:27] <kenny_biff> maul wasn't alive until they made him alive in tv shows
[0:54:30] <DatAsuna> It's very lame
[0:54:31] <%Tk254> He's a shit lord!
[0:54:35] <andrei11dr> Nope
[0:54:37] <+oda_flobunaga> there is adifference
[0:54:41] <Sapphire_Breeze> a simp lord
[0:54:42] <DatAsuna> Ventress got fridged for a white guy with dreads
[0:54:48] <%spacehouse> Very Sloppy Planning
[0:54:49] <%jiggy_snipe> maybe the Jedi are idiots
[0:54:51] <+captain_history> Maul is pretty well handled in the TV shows so it makes up for it
[0:54:53] <+Zouledge> @datasuna I agree, also dosent help that grievous in rots pales when compared to his gendy version as a fighter.
[0:54:57] <DatAsuna> Also Quinlan lost his family man backstory
[0:55:03] <notenoughgirls> god dark disciple is awful
[0:55:16] <DatAsuna> @Zouledge not just his genndy version, hes lso just weaker than all his legends book and comic appearances

[0:56:55] <+evbites> I like big boss

[0:56:58] <akman14> Big boss thiinks santa is real
[0:57:05] <Halospaz117> Vader's gonna replace himself with a stormtrooper and form his own Outer Empire
[0:57:08] <DatAsuna> @Zouledge I getcha but a lot of folks think it's a weird one off, but he was always shown as dangerous before the reboot

[0:57:16] <grandark_z317> Kylo sucks, tho
[0:57:16] <+dezimaly> so Pat was kinda but mostly wrong kind of right

[0:57:40] <derap41> But its Disney corporate they can't allow og stuff to damage the ip
[0:57:44] <DatAsuna> That first vader scene in rogue one sucks, it's just vader making a bad pun
[0:57:47] <%FallenAngelZelos> Force Awakens had such a strong start *sigh*

[0:57:59] <Psyramics> I knew going into Rogue One that they would all die, so I didn't get attached to any of them

[0:59:20] <joshua_42> “Alright then keep your secrets”
[0:59:23] <derap41> Yellow is also the worst color
[0:59:23] <kenny_biff> they gave her yellow because its different y'all
[0:59:27] <$realm_forge> It’s somewhat based off of light based color blending
[0:59:28] <%SirGO0SE> member yellow? LUL
[0:59:29] <notenoughgirls> they gave her yellow because toys
[0:59:32] <%Tk254> woolieYE

[0:59:46] <%Gruhunchously> POWER ON
[0:59:48] <$GabeSweetMan> Her color should have been beige LUL
[0:59:49] <+oda_flobunaga> harder to turn off
[0:59:58] <derap41> Its a new gimmick they can sell
[0:59:59] <donstylo> A Laser Butterfly Knife.
[0:59:59] <$realm_forge> I love stupid lightsabers
[1:00:01] <+dezimaly> hope it has a saftey to stop the spin
[1:00:04] <KidKame1> Honestly at this point if Disney want to continue with Star Wars, they should just fast forward a few hundred/thousand years. That way they can make their own story without relying on OT Nostalgia
[1:00:07] <ergothgaming> Rey should have had bronze
[1:00:07] <superelitejimi> was black ever a color of saber outside of force unleashed?
[1:00:13] <andrei11dr> I will say, Kailos saber is probably my favorite thing from the new movies
[1:00:14] <joshua_42> Yes
[1:00:17] <$legacy0117> I guess I'll look it up.
[1:00:19] <+Zouledge> I still don’t understand why she never got a double bladed lightsaber
[1:00:20] <%Gruhunchously> ew
[1:00:21] <grandark_z317> No, fuck you, everything the Skywalkers had is hers now.
[1:00:26] <grandark_z317> NotLikeThis
[1:00:33] <joshua_42> @superelitejimi Mandos use Black Sabers
[1:00:43] <derap41> You Haven't read I have no mouth?
[1:00:44] <DatAsuna> Doing that to yourself would double suck
[1:00:45] <notenoughgirls> there's only one black saber
[1:00:48] <goodakuma> how dare you
[1:00:49] <+oda_flobunaga> The Thrawn books are good, if t=you haven't read those
[1:00:51] <derap41> its like 5 pages tops
[1:00:52] <superelitejimi> i thought the dark saber was a different thing?
[1:01:02] <$legacy0117> Black and White colors exist, but you have to be pure light or dark side to wield them.
[1:01:03] <%FallenAngelZelos> Good god Disney please just leave the Skywalkers and everyone associated behind
[1:01:10] <%jiggy_snipe> Riley
[1:01:10] <+captain_history> oh yeah, the new Thrawn books are pretty good
[1:01:13] <$GabeSweetMan> Correct answer.
[1:01:17] <+oda_flobunaga> THe one played by Sam Jackson
[1:01:18] <$legacy0117> And that's hard to achieve.
[1:01:21] <andrei11dr> Riley, totally
[1:01:22] <notenoughgirls> bleeding before bleeding?
[1:01:24] <%BisoromiBear> A Pimp Named Slickback
[1:01:27] <$realm_forge> Eventually all Sith shrivel up into evil grandpas
[1:01:42] <%jiggy_snipe> ya know what, there are alot good answers for that Boondocks question lol
[1:02:07] <+oda_flobunaga> With 3 lines of dialog...
[1:02:09] <+oda_flobunaga> lol
[1:02:15] <JetpackMcQuack> Her main personality trait is being shiny
[1:02:19] <derap41> She's a non character
[1:02:19] <vulkan_vibes> the Poe one isnt bad
[1:02:23] <%mighty_max_t> Aphra's cool
[1:02:28] <+captain_history> The Phasma novel was alright
[1:02:34] <joshua_42> I forgot she existed
[1:02:34] <DatAsuna> You'll see her when you do triple zero
[1:02:34] <RunoEddie> the Phasma novel isn't bad
[1:02:35] <%Tk254> "They really tried to make her a character" sums up Disney Star Wars
[1:02:41] <derap41> Obiwan tho
[1:02:43] <DatAsuna> the phasma book is fine
[1:02:44] <DatAsuna> just fine
[1:02:46] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus Dr. Aphra is ACTUALLY the best new character. That's also where the evil C3PO and R2D2 are introduced. They are the best.
[1:02:49] <+AbnormalVoid> LUL
[1:02:58] <DatAsuna> give me durge
[1:02:59] <notenoughgirls> if they really wanted to make phasma a character they shouldve actually made her a character in the fucking films
[1:03:01] <%Gruhunchously> TR-8R
[1:03:02] <vulkan_vibes> Poe is our 1st main character dedicated pilot that wasn't a jedi or a freelancer
[1:03:04] <%klholland92> roman reigns
[1:03:09] <$GabeSweetMan> BOO
[1:03:09] <andrei11dr> Boba Fett had more going on than Phasma
[1:03:10] <+sunriser101> remember when bob fett did fuck all in the movies and got eaten?
[1:03:22] <%ChoculaUltra> Boy they really tried to push Phasma, in retrospect.
[1:03:24] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus Dr. Aphra is ACTUALLY the best new character. That's also where the evil C3PO and R2D2 are introduced. They are the best.
[1:03:27] <1matheuw> THE BABY?
[1:03:33] <+aishman> Also THE BABY
[1:03:34] <$realm_forge> Baby yoda is the real chosen one
[1:03:36] <alrobot2014> instead we ended up with Baby Nut
[1:03:37] <+Zanco23> Doesn't make sense to call him "Baby Yoda", he's not related
[1:03:42] <DatAsuna> the VR ambassador
[1:03:48] <JetpackMcQuack> Kudos
[1:03:51] <%RioGascar> I basically am
[1:03:52] <derap41> Its just like a faf about light saber game
[1:04:00] <%andrex2311> VR expert, nice title
[1:04:04] <DatAsuna> the voice acting is real bad
[1:04:07] <goodakuma> Why is Jesus/Obi-Wan next to Woolie?
[1:04:10] <RunoEddie> but the Phasma novel made me extra disappointed when they unceremoniously killed her in episode VIII
[1:04:13] <%Binary_Fireball> the murder simulator?
[1:04:20] <dinnydanny777> Jedi Academy has great lightsabers
[1:04:21] <StarlitStunner> It’s pretty good, a better watch than a play experience
[1:04:24] <%RioGascar> Sword and sorcery
[1:04:25] <derap41> Kinect had it
[1:04:27] <derap41> just saying
[1:04:27] <DatAsuna> RED STEEL 2 THE GOAT
[1:04:31] <andrei11dr> Oh ,imagine if they put HK in the Old Republic movie they say they want to do! God, please no NotLikeThis
[1:04:37] <+oda_flobunaga> YEAH
[1:04:43] <notenoughgirls> that vr game apparently explains why mustafar doesnt look like mustafar when kylo goes there in episode 9
[1:04:47] <+oda_flobunaga> Yuuzhong Vong planet drop
[1:04:47] <Robot_Nixon_> FeelsBadMan
[1:04:50] <%Irridium> one of the novels I think.
[1:04:53] <+Zanco23> Vector Prime, right?
[1:04:53] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:04:55] <DatAsuna> Yuuzhan vong war
[1:04:57] <+ZoltanBMagnus> So... GT piccolo
[1:04:57] <+captain_history> from the New Jedi Order books
[1:04:58] <%RioGascar> Wait kylo goes to mustifar
[1:05:00] <+glgzephyr> it's the first Yuuzhan Vong book
[1:05:04] <%RioGascar> Waht
[1:05:05] <+DorianCreed> It's from the first Yuuzhan Vong novel
[1:05:05] <+MalekDracarus> Book
[1:05:08] <+glgzephyr> Something Prime
[1:05:09] <joshua_42> The Wii version of Force Unleashed is pretty good making you feel like a sith
[1:05:09] <JetpackMcQuack> Disney wiped that away for sure
[1:05:11] <+MidnightBurst12> Killed by a falling moon
[1:05:12] <%alpacasintophats> Blade and Sorcerer is that medieval vr game
[1:05:15] <derap41> How about the deathh of his kids?
[1:05:16] <donstylo> In the EU Leia managed a Refugee center for aliens.
[1:05:23] <%BisoromiBear> even death lets the wookie win
[1:05:24] <+DorianCreed> Chewie dies by being crushed by a falling moon, so at least he goes out like a boss
[1:05:25] <+MalekDracarus> Moon death
[1:05:29] <%FallenAngelZelos> Force unleashed was mehhhhhhhh
[1:05:32] <%illtima> You can kill Chewbacca in Force Unleashed
[1:05:32] <notenoughgirls> kylo is on mustafar at the beginning of e9 but they never say its mustafar
[1:05:34] <%illtima> and Han
[1:05:36] <vulkan_vibes> wookies live so long humans are like dogs to them
[1:05:37] <%illtima> and everyone else
[1:05:38] <DatAsuna> Keyword: superficial
[1:05:38] <%ChoculaUltra> if anyone wants to have a solid, hearty laugh, I wholeheartedly recommend the Rise of Skywalker novelization.
[1:05:39] <dinnydanny777> I want Disney to commit to the idea of the Yuuzhan Vong
[1:05:41] <DatAsuna> yes
[1:05:42] <Eger007> Eternal empire
[1:05:44] <eliudfs1> those trailers for Swtor though
[1:05:58] <ZeeJiggle> Fallen Empire. Eternal Throne was the thing after (I believe)
[1:06:06] <derap41> So those sabers are getting dug up next Movie
[1:06:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @eliudfs1 They were waaaaaay better than the product LUL
[1:06:10] <eliudfs1> yes!
[1:06:10] <fist_wizard_jay> Thats a shitty way to kill off Chewie
[1:06:12] <ZeeJiggle> Those CG trailers are dope.
[1:06:13] <Halospaz117> Decieved is such a fucking amazing trailer
[1:06:18] <%wunp_fxs> They were alldone by blur if i recall
[1:06:20] <Sapphire_Breeze> show us as well PogChamp
[1:06:20] <dinnydanny777> Has J J Abrams ever made a movie that isn't super derivative though
[1:06:21] <+Zanco23> @dinnydanny777 Zonoma Sekot is apparently canon
[1:06:22] <alrobot2014> the swtor trailers got me real excited
[1:06:22] <%Bluemanzee> Truuuu
[1:06:23] <+captain_history> @dinnydanny777 The new Thrawn books actually get into the idea that there is something bad outside the universe.
[1:06:24] <%wunp_fxs> great fx studio
[1:06:26] <StarlitStunner> Those CGI are great!
[1:06:28] <eliudfs1> those trailers are mini movies!
[1:06:28] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus I already have an mpm4 of thsoe waiting for you lol
[1:06:42] <+Zouledge> swtor trailers are amazing, but I don’t care for the story past lvl 50
[1:06:43] <DarkDsion> trailer yes old trepublic
[1:06:48] <derap41> Space Cowboy
[1:06:48] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus Those people animated the sonic movie as well
[1:06:58] <dinnydanny777> I like the idea of Disney pushing super dark stories for Star Wars and find it hilarious
[1:07:11] <%wunp_fxs> its super well done
[1:07:12] <donstylo> SWOtoR is not that bad, some classes had a really good story.
[1:07:15] <DatAsuna> They're also relatively lore heavy events
[1:07:16] <%illtima> Republic Trooper yo!
[1:07:20] <+Zouledge> Same people who made swtor trailers made the cg for halo anniversary stuff
[1:07:24] <ZeeJiggle> As long as you don't think about it being your standard MMO gameplay, ye
[1:07:25] <%reknownblackcat> is this just beginning or just ending?
[1:07:33] <andrei11dr> Can't you straight up talk to Reeven in SWOTOR?
[1:07:38] <Halospaz117> Reminder that the Star Wars Galaxies Emulator is a thing
[1:07:44] <joshua_42> You can talk to HK’s head
[1:07:48] <derap41> Star War is really intresting without the Jedi shit
[1:07:51] <dinnydanny777> Did Revan do anything wrong, really?
[1:07:53] <+Zanco23> @andrei11dr Shhh...

[1:08:28] <RunoEddie> honestly I enjoy following the Star Wars audio books way more than the movies
[1:08:34] <$GabeSweetMan> I despise that Abram's stupid god damn Mystery Box has become so prolific. It's not a writing style, it's a marketing gimmick. A good one, but don't use it as a method of writing your stories when the box contains disappointment.
[1:08:35] <%Camail> you cant make a playable class "chosen one"

[1:08:57] <donstylo> Yes it can
[1:08:58] <ralphfromdk> And somehow a trooper or a smuggler is just as good in a fight as a jedi.... because balance over lore sense.
[1:09:00] <dinnydanny777> Republic Commando is awesome
[1:09:03] <%jiggy_snipe> yea
[1:09:06] <%OldManDeckardCain> WEEB > FORCE

[1:09:24] <olaksi> Can't wait 10 years when all the future hipsters come out explaining how actually the 3rd trilogy is an artistically misunderstood masterpiece
[1:09:26] <Halospaz117> I appreciate how legit that answer was
[1:09:27] <%FallenAngelZelos> Which Goku shot the kamehameha?
[1:09:30] <ZeeJiggle> Oh ye, Republic Commando is awesome
[1:09:32] <vulkan_vibes> wasn't planet destruction surpassed by like, Bui saga? like standard shit?

[1:09:36] <notenoughgirls> republic commando fucks
[1:09:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> NOTHING IS STRONGER THAN ANIME
[1:09:39] <dinnydanny777> Is Ultra Instinct even strong though, isn't it weaker in power than the other forms he's just basically untouchable
[1:09:43] <Space_Pagan> Republic Commando is the best

[1:10:39] <dinnydanny777> Didn't Vegeta accidentally blow up Earth or something once?

[1:10:41] <%Tk254> Rule number 89: Never say No to Bacta!"
[1:10:44] <%ThePimpGuin> maybe Woolie should watch that lol
[1:10:46] <superelitejimi> I've been worried since UI came out that where are going to get another Blue like form where he just combines UI and SS, we all know they will want to sell more toys, so..
[1:10:47] <joshua_42> UI Goku in FighterZ looks nutty
[1:10:54] <%spacehouse> Power Levels are Stupid by PlagueOfGripes

[1:11:35] <vulkan_vibes> @markuriah yea! I more meant when it becomes a thing almost all the cast could do casually.
[1:11:35] <andrei11dr> I wonder is Atton could kill Goku
[1:11:36] <dinnydanny777> Goku's one weakness is rocks*
[1:11:42] <%ChoculaUltra> Goku's fighting a magic goat rn.

[1:15:40] <andrei11dr> Destroy Droid being Dark Side makes no sense
[1:15:41] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus Hey V, on your off-screen playthrough did you try just force pushing the handmaidens out of the circle for that 5 vs 1?
[1:15:59] <MarkUriah> Left. Right. No, up. Turn around. Right. Good
[1:16:09] <dinnydanny777> Destroy Droid is pure evil, Droids are good boiis
[1:16:27] <dinnydanny777> What kind of sick monster would want to destroy a droid
[1:16:37] <DatAsuna> The light side is just racist to droids
[1:16:39] <GreyCaspa > @call_me_comic Ok. That makes sense
[1:16:44] <andrei11dr> @dinnydanny777 The Clone Wars would disagree
[1:16:50] <DatAsuna> You could force cheat to have that as well

[1:23:51] <derap41> Fallen order was EA trying to score good boy points

[1:35:25] <+Zanco23> Force Heal?
[1:35:25] <$Invlux> He used Maximize Spell

[1:36:00] <%DemonOfSalt> Force Storm was already something Palpatine could do in the original post-ROTJ EU/Legends Canon. Like his clones, they imported that from the Dark Empire story.

[1:36:17] <%andrex2311> 8 bombs?

[1:36:30] <derap41> No 5G here we're finally safe

[1:36:48] <Iwashi94> crazy talk?
[1:36:56] <DSD24> @ChoculaUltra Its so funny!
[1:36:57] <$Invlux> Could Palp do that magnitude on other foce abilities?
[1:37:04] <+oda_flobunaga> @DemonOfSalt but If I remember, the Dark Empire story took place within months after the Battle of Endor...

[1:38:26] <Ner234> Why is it always Force Lightning? Can Force Users use other elements?
[1:38:29] <$Invlux> monkaS
[1:38:30] <ALTRNico> amazing
[1:38:37] <%DemonOfSalt> @oda_flobunaga Something like that.
[1:38:39] <%Gruhunchously> Of course it does
[1:38:42] <%andrex2311> awesome
[1:38:47] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Within days, faced with nothing to eat, the body begins feeding on itself. "The body starts to consume energy stores — carbohydrates, fats and then the protein parts of tissue. Eventually, nothing is left for the body to scavenge except muscle. You're consuming your own muscle, including the heart muscle then u die
[1:38:47] <huskarl_zap> when did they finish onderon?
[1:38:48] <derap41> But only good Palp can Force impregnate across the galaxy so he's got that going for him
[1:38:49] <ZeeJiggle> Only Sith intentionally use Wifi
[1:38:49] <superelitejimi> force fire would be cool
[1:38:54] <%SirGO0SE> the power of 5g
[1:38:54] <Safarihat> missed a door!
[1:38:58] <vulkan_vibes> the plot of the attack on exogal was to take out the 5G tower
[1:38:59] <+oda_flobunaga> @DemonOfSalt not 30 fracking years
[1:39:02] <ZeeJiggle> They're on their hotspots
[1:39:03] <YakumoYomi> Gotta overload all those 5G conduits
[1:39:04] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Its rly fucked
[1:39:04] <derap41> Force Impregnate is not a good name for an ability
[1:39:05] <DSD24> Healing!
[1:39:09] <%HostilePoundcakes> HEALING
[1:39:11] <gandalfsmagicgaydick> Didn't they miss a big doo?
[1:39:13] <gandalfsmagicgaydick> door*
[1:39:17] <DatAsuna> Don't forget "Force you didn't win"
[1:39:18] <Safarihat> @WoolieVersus you missed a room!
[1:39:18] <dinnydanny777> Do Jedi even need guns can't they just keep bullets or shrapnel in their pockets and use force push
[1:39:27] <JetpackMcQuack> Damn power creep
[1:39:29] <lotharrio> Remember when Yoda just called lightning down as a Force ghost?
[1:39:32] <superelitejimi> force choke into force impregnate combo
[1:39:33] <%BisoromiBear> There's literally no reason to be alive anymore
[1:39:40] <+QuasartheHero> !uptime
[1:39:41] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 39 minutes
[1:39:42] <Ner234> @superelitejimi monkaS
[1:39:44] <Redblood801> All these young Jedi keep Force Ghosting me at their interviews
[1:39:46] <%SirGO0SE> got yourself a force ghost house and some force ghost kids
[1:39:47] <olaksi> It's kind of ironic Force Immortality is a lightside power
[1:39:49] <%SirGO0SE> its just livin man
[1:39:50] <notenoughgirls> why didnt the ghosts just solve all the problems
[1:39:52] <$GabeSweetMan> Force Choke Jerk?
[1:39:56] <dinnydanny777> Remember when Kylo Ren basically had force paralysis
[1:39:58] <JetpackMcQuack> wife later
[1:39:58] <%ChoculaUltra> could a jedi/sith like force project into someone and possess them with their force ghost/soul thing?
[1:40:04] <%LordSDB> I wonder how the other 1000 dead jedi ghost felt about Vader joining them
[1:40:04] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:40:05] <lotharrio> You're already light side. Just Force bone.
[1:40:06] <%Merhabi> thats a darkside power
[1:40:06] <+oda_flobunaga> that Zeus shit
[1:40:09] <$Invlux> @superelitejimi Force Choke-Jerk must be STRONG
[1:40:12] <UberKingKai> It’s a Jedi sith face off
[1:40:16] <MarkUriah> @dinnydanny777 I'm imagining a Jedi Gambit type of character. Dope as hell
[1:40:19] <%SirGO0SE> ugh my wife and force ghost wife are fighting again
[1:40:21] <+Zanco23> In Legacy, Force Heal also had a dark side version, that involved healing them with lightning.
[1:40:24] <damienlunas> Force NUUUUUUUUUUUUT
[1:40:28] <%Merhabi> force choke jerk is dark side for sure
[1:40:32] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Could a Force Ghost posses a physical body
[1:40:33] <%reknownblackcat> can we force push an abortion?
[1:40:38] <akman14> The granny?
[1:40:40] <gandalfsmagicgaydick> Missed a big time important room I think
[1:40:41] <%wunp_fxs> lol i forget about that part
[1:40:41] <%ChoculaUltra> @Invlux some would call Force Choke-jerk...unnatural
[1:40:43] <notenoughgirls> force miscarriage
[1:40:44] <derap41> I love that Mexican Momma
[1:40:52] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Altered Carbon S1 is good but S2 is .......meh
[1:41:02] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Gladly each Season was stand alone
[1:41:05] <RrenKrieg> room missed
[1:41:05] <+oda_flobunaga> Darth Carridine?
[1:41:13] <%SirGO0SE> light side in the streets, dark side in the sheets
[1:41:14] <%wildcard_9000> Jedi Party
[1:41:14] <Safarihat> so many missed rooms
[1:41:19] <superelitejimi> darth cosby
[1:41:21] <Manly_Rose> missed rooms
[1:41:22] <derap41> Altered Carbon is also a really good Cyberpunk book
[1:41:24] <gandalfsmagicgaydick> Go back pls
[1:41:24] <lotharrio> The Jedi just don't want assholes hanging out as Force ghosts.
[1:41:24] <+DorianCreed> Nah, 24 hours to live, send one of those "You will die in 24 hours if you do not forward this to ten people" emails
[1:41:25] <$GabeSweetMan> "What are you going to do? Zap me?" Says Force Lightning Victim
[1:41:29] <Nested_Dreams> Force Diplomatic Immunity
[1:41:37] <%ChoculaUltra> Dark Lord Carridine, tempted by the power of the force chokejerk
[1:41:43] <%kapcommunist> yoda inside of a polaroid photo
[1:41:43] <+Zanco23> The Force clearly cares, your body gets messed up when you go dark.
[1:41:51] <dinnydanny777> Are Jedi kind of like incels
[1:41:58] <JetpackMcQuack> All the parties would be straight edge
[1:42:00] <derap41> Obi-wan waving his dick at Vader 24/7
[1:42:02] <vulkan_vibes> zoom bombing but it's force ghosts
[1:42:02] <%BisoromiBear> That's just SG-1
[1:42:02] <+FlyingRamen> I brought the boos cause im a ghost!
[1:42:03] <Ashenik1> I bet there are some nice hot Jedi master
[1:42:03] <fist_wizard_jay> Maybe you will ASCEND like Ozzie
[1:42:04] <dinnydanny777> They seem to hate women
[1:42:06] <superelitejimi> jedi are the ultimate incels
[1:42:07] <$Invlux> Sith force choke somebody and when they die take their pants off for kicks
[1:42:08] <DSD24> Would that be a Force Wraith?
[1:42:08] <gandalfsmagicgaydick> The Jedi are bad at dating because they force ghost so often
[1:42:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> You know you could probably use the force to give you or someone else really good orgasms LUL
[1:42:19] <MarkUriah> @BallerSwagBro9k How'd you feel at the end of Altered Carbon S1? I felt the relationship stuff was a dowturn.
[1:42:36] <+eanscrale> "Yo remember when you tried to fry me, good times."
[1:42:39] <gandalfsmagicgaydick> I think you missed a plot room
[1:42:40] <YakumoYomi> Ghosts are just trolls. That's why they throw shit and haunt people.
[1:42:42] <%Gruhunchously> We good guys remewmbewr
[1:42:42] <olaksi> Why didn't Obi-Wan just annoy Palpatine to death, imagine a force ghost waving his ghost dick at your face 24/7
[1:42:43] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus till you encounter the sith that can consume force ghosts *cough cough* SWTOR *cough cough*
[1:42:54] <huskarl_zap> They'd jut search for permanent death
[1:42:55] <siamzero94> keep it
[1:42:55] <giovanni1239> i know the in force unleashed ben dies and he becomes a force ghost and tries to kill star killer
[1:42:58] <Redblood801> We need Light Side
[1:43:01] <%Gruhunchously> WE GOOD GUYS REMEMBER
[1:43:02] <%DemonOfSalt> Darth Revan and Vandar's Force Ghosts sitting down to play Pazaak is a good image.
[1:43:05] <DSD24> How about she gets this shit herself
[1:43:06] <dinnydanny777> Guys you don't get it, all force powers can be explained by the midichlorians
[1:43:11] <Manly_Rose> WOOLIE NO
[1:43:14] <+Zanco23> There was a sith ghost in kotor 1, Ajunta Pall, so was Karness Muur. The modern Sith don't seem to know how to do it though.
[1:43:23] <dinnydanny777> Palpatine can do that cause he has high Midichlorians
[1:43:25] <%StryderStrikesAt> After obi wan died he really started fucking with vader
[1:43:26] <derap41> @olaksi Ï'm just imagining Him standing behind Palpatine swinging away while Palpatine is talking to Luke
[1:43:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @MarkUriah Same overall S1 was good cuz it kept those parts to a minimum. S2 goes full throttle with it and the plot suffers hard. The only good part of S2 imo was Poe
[1:43:42] <DarkDsion> nooooo
[1:43:47] <lotharrio> You have like 5 sabers already don't you?
[1:43:50] <%alpharius88> you have like 5 ligthsabers
[1:43:55] <subjectg> why do we need even more lightsabers
[1:43:56] <$GabeSweetMan> Mine now.
[1:43:58] <dinnydanny777> Palpatine should have given a speech about his genetic superiority manifested in his high midichlorian count
[1:44:02] <Iwashi94> THE DEAD SPEAK
[1:44:08] <siamzero94> you can never have enough plasma swords
[1:44:09] <dinnydanny777> Star Wars is basically eugenics
[1:44:18] <derap41> @BallerSwagBro9k It kinda shows that only season 1 was based on a book
[1:44:18] <superelitejimi> zoro this shit with the lightsabers, two in hand, one in mouth
[1:44:33] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @dinnydanny777 PALPATINE HAD THE PLAN
[1:44:35] <gandalfsmagicgaydick> I think the Sith Ghost thing is more that they're chained to a specific thing, like their grave or something. Whereas light side force ghosts are free to roam
[1:44:38] <%DemonOfSalt> [FORCE PERSUADE WRITING] I am the sole beneficiary of this trust.
[1:44:39] <%phatmac16> THE DEAD SPEAK!
[1:44:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @derap41 Yup
[1:44:46] <$GabeSweetMan> "Don't believe his JEdi lies."
[1:44:47] <olaksi> Couldn't you just be able to inject yourself with midchlorians for a huge temporary power boos? Like force doping?
[1:44:50] <Redblood801> If only Zoro had lightsabers during his fight with Mihawk
[1:44:50] <$Invlux> +2 will save
[1:45:04] <Robot_Nixon_> those were the droids he was looking for FeelsBadMan
[1:45:16] <DSD24> That lady sucked anyway
[1:45:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @olaksi Force Danzo? Possibly LUL
[1:45:31] <dinnydanny777> RIP
[1:45:32] <%reknownblackcat> "Don't believe the waving man" tattooed on the arm
[1:45:35] <derap41> Now I'm confused
[1:45:36] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus in SWTOR as a sith you can literally bind force ghosts to your will...ghosts ain't that untouchable.
[1:45:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Who is this? LUL
[1:45:48] <+griffball13> uh huh
[1:46:03] <Halospaz117> hehe, poop
[1:46:08] <%Merhabi> hehe
[1:46:11] <DatAsuna> Coward npc
[1:46:12] <dinnydanny777> Why did Anakin even have high midichlorians
[1:46:20] <%phatmac16> Johhny Sasaki??
[1:46:23] <DatAsuna> @dinnydanny777 because no father
[1:46:24] <$Invlux> poodoo
[1:46:25] <derap41> @dinnydanny777 Palpy cummies
[1:46:30] <derap41> ew
[1:46:32] <superelitejimi> ew...
[1:46:35] <Kirbachev> Chosen One plot device
[1:46:36] <Nested_Dreams> That guy sounds hella constipated
[1:46:37] <$Invlux> ew
[1:46:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @dinnydanny777 He was Force Jesus
[1:46:42] <%phatmac16> Take your Palpy cummies
[1:46:42] <Ashenik1> @dinnydanny777 cause plot
[1:46:43] <derap41> that as bad even in my head
[1:46:45] <notenoughgirls> anakin had high midichlorians so he could force give padme that fruit\
[1:46:47] <abelincoln_catpuncher> Johnny Tsunami?
[1:46:56] <Safarihat> we missed 3 rooms
[1:46:58] <gandalfsmagicgaydick> Plot door
[1:47:15] <%Gruhunchously> Have we been to the Disciple Room
[1:47:15] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[1:47:21] <%SirGO0SE> TIME FOR MURDER
[1:47:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> In my mind Starkiller had the highest Midi CHolrian count in the old canon tho
[1:47:29] <gandalfsmagicgaydick> @Gruhunchously No
[1:47:31] <ALTRNico> totally murdered this guy
[1:47:31] <DatAsuna> Because you totally need another lightsaber. lol
[1:47:33] <Redblood801> Y-yeah... a blaster
[1:47:34] <derap41> But I mean accidents can happen this is a dangerous place
[1:47:51] <notenoughgirls> looks like sequel trilogy luke
[1:48:05] <dinnydanny777> Star killer kind of got his ass kicked at the end of the forcd unleashed though
[1:48:16] <derap41> I'm getting The Dude vibes
[1:48:27] <dinnydanny777> I guess he kind of won but he only did by killing himself
[1:48:32] <superelitejimi> @dinnydanny777 i thought he literally died
[1:48:38] <superelitejimi> nvm
[1:48:53] <siamzero94> bs you have a lightsaber hobo with a shotgun
[1:49:03] <derap41> Pain
[1:49:04] <Redblood801> THE DEAD SPEAK
[1:49:26] <$GabeSweetMan> THE SCRIPT SPEAKS
[1:49:32] <notenoughgirls> THE DEAD CREATE LEGAL DISPUTES
[1:49:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @dinnydanny777 Not rly he fought and beat VAder and Palps back to back. His death was kinda BS. Force lighning explosion somehow kills him and doesnt scratch Sidous or Vader LUL
[1:49:41] <superelitejimi> the dude abides
[1:49:47] <%phatmac16> THE DEAD COMMUNES
[1:50:05] <dinnydanny777> I can't remember what happens in the sequel but I think he lost there too
[1:50:18] <dinnydanny777> But I mean, they weren't gonna kill the main characters I guess
[1:50:21] <$GabeSweetMan> THE DEAD REAK!
[1:50:26] <+kewlmyc> CAROLE BASKIN
[1:50:39] <$GabeSweetMan> Kill 'er. Husband. Whacked 'im!
[1:50:47] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @dinnydanny777 Nope Clone SK defeats Vader and captures him. They take him back to the Rebels for trial and it ends in cliffhanger
[1:50:55] <dinnydanny777> I think this guy's a Jedi
[1:50:58] <DSD24> Didn't Starkiller die at the end of Unleashed and they cloned him?
[1:51:00] <%phatmac16> HE SPITTIN
[1:51:02] <notenoughgirls> this is the smartest guy in the series
[1:51:06] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yup
[1:51:10] <$GabeSweetMan> Smart dude
[1:51:18] <%FuqBoiSlim> he snapped
[1:51:24] <%phatmac16> I love me some cranky old dudes
[1:51:28] <dinnydanny777> Do you think in Star Wars they have like witch trials but for Jedi
[1:51:39] <%Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus Check the big room on the far opposite end of the entrance
[1:51:41] <dinnydanny777> People report their neighbours who they hate as being Jedi?
[1:51:42] <derap41> Wow he mmade a mess here
[1:51:44] <+Zanco23> Thank you John!
[1:51:53] <%phatmac16> you made John happy
[1:51:55] <derap41> That litter box is overflowing
[1:52:02] <+oda_flobunaga> big shit pile in the middle of the floor though
[1:52:04] <ZeeJiggle> You can be almost fully dark by the end of Telos if you just hard go for it
[1:52:11] <Redblood801> A smiling John shines so bright
[1:52:20] <alrobot2014> i managed full dark side by the start of nar shadaa
[1:52:22] <%phatmac16> WHAT'S IN THE DOOR!?!?!
[1:52:24] <subjectg> @woolieversus if you haven’t been told yet, you wanna keep goto around when talking to jorran
[1:52:25] <dinnydanny777> I bet John William's has a wholesome smile
[1:52:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> If EA was smart thyed do a full remake of KOTOR 1/2 like FF7 got.
[1:53:07] <SnaKemuho> Armor parts won through pazaak @WoolieVersus
[1:53:11] <Bassman_PhD> ya lightsaber crystals
[1:53:13] <dinnydanny777> If EA were smart they would make another Burnout game (please)
[1:53:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> True that
[1:53:22] <Bassman_PhD> you got a bunch of lightsaber stuff last session
[1:53:23] <lotharrio> Guns?
[1:53:24] <DSD24> If EA were Smart
[1:53:29] <derap41> If EA were smart they wouldn't be EA
[1:53:35] <xiccy> Burnout sucks
[1:53:36] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Also true LUL
[1:53:37] <Redblood801> If EA were smart, they'd remake Rogue Squadron with the Ace Combat guys
[1:53:38] <lotharrio> Get a new gun for G0-T0?
[1:53:44] <+MidnightBurst12> @ballerswagbro9k not if you don't want lore fuckery
[1:53:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @xiccy I will turn this car around
[1:53:50] <dinnydanny777> Burnout is awesome I won't accept this slander
[1:53:51] <%ChoculaUltra> John Williams gets to say "I made that" anytime Binary Sunset comes on.
[1:54:03] <Bassman_PhD> color too!
[1:54:04] <Kirbachev> Why would you trust EA to do a remake of anything without gutting it with DLC, microtransactions, and gambling? Just leave these games the way they are.
[1:54:43] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @Kirbachev Fallen Order proved they can do good. Now wether they do it remains to be seen
[1:54:43] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:54:51] <Redblood801> !MOTIVATED
[1:54:51] <@Moobot> 1174 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[1:54:55] <NeakGX> double keen
[1:54:56] <%BallerSwagBro9k> And no i dont trust them
[1:54:57] <%phatmac16> you some more Keen? Go play Commander Keen
[1:55:00] <DSD24> Let see purple!
[1:55:02] <dinnydanny777> Need for Speed is EA too I think
[1:55:03] <andrei11dr> Also everyone that made these games have nothing to do with EA now at day's
[1:55:06] <akman14> Killer Keenstar
[1:55:10] <dinnydanny777> At least owned by EA
[1:55:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Cmon purple
[1:55:13] <derap41> @andrei11dr
[1:55:25] <Kirbachev> @BallerSwagBro9k Aye, I'll give them that, but that could very easily be a flash in the pan. One exception isn't and should not be enough.
[1:55:30] <%jiggy_snipe> lol
[1:55:30] <derap41> @andrei11dr yup that old guard is long gone
[1:55:33] <%kapcommunist> qarth?
[1:55:35] <%DemonOfSalt> Woolie, I sent this before but I think I didn't do so correctly. Just wanted to thank you and LittleV from the bottom of my heart as both a KOTOR/TSL fan and a beta tester of the Restored Content Mod for this playthrough, it means the world to me. Also, thank you for your content in general, it has kept me going through some pretty rough weeks of my life. Rock on both of you!
[1:55:40] <%ChoculaUltra> I highly doubt anyone who had a serious hand in the KOTOR games are still with Bioware. At least if Anthem and DAI are anything to go off of.
[1:55:59] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @Kirbachev Oh i hard agree. I await to see wherethey go from now
[1:56:08] <Ashenik1> even HK?? :O
[1:56:16] <%Gruhunchously> Hot Take: Disciple isn't even that bad a character, people just don't take against him because he's an exclusive party member to Handmaiden.
[1:56:27] <%heroversusofficial> Oooooh snaps saber squad
[1:56:36] <$GabeSweetMan> Whaaaaat? No waaaaaay.
[1:56:41] <DSD24> I am pretty sure Disciple has some cool stuff
[1:56:53] <AvailableThor> Disciple is pretty cool.
[1:56:57] <Redblood801> Czerka ripping it's customers off? Who coulda seen that coming?
[1:57:04] <%BallerSwagBro9k> You cant spell Czerka without EA
[1:57:07] <%heroversusofficial> Scamaz
[1:57:09] <dinnydanny777> Czerka did nothing wrong
[1:57:16] <PunkZedB> Is sith a racial slur or something? do you need an S-word pass?
[1:57:17] <notenoughgirls> ive had playthroughs where i complete disciple's storyline in the first conversation with him
[1:57:18] <DatAsuna> @DemonOfSalt I saw you sent it correct last week, they just don't see highlight messages in the message feed they look at during breaks
[1:57:18] <AvailableThor> Also there are plenty of waifus in this game without Handmaiden so you don't lose much.
[1:57:18] <dinnydanny777> Is it wrong to commit fraud?
[1:57:19] <subjectg> @gruhunchously it’s not that he’s bad particularly, he’s just uninteresting in comparison
[1:57:27] <Imsoverylazy> Disciple is the Roman Reigns of KOTOR 2 party members. There's nothing necessarily wrong with him its just that the rest of the cast are all far more exciting.
[1:57:36] <Kirbachev> @Gruhunchously He's interesting insofar as he's a dude interested in the objective history of the Force, and the Jedi and Sith by extension. There aren't many characters like that in the entire franchise. I kinda wish he had more interactions with Kreia, because she's seen it all.
[1:57:53] <andrei11dr> It's insane that Obsidian are still a thing after getting fucked by EA with this and then Bethesda with New Vegas
[1:57:54] <DatAsuna> @DemonOfSalt If you wanna make sure they see it, donation or sub message is the way, highlight is a low odds dice roll, and timing matters a lot on that too.

[1:58:30] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 58 minutes
[1:58:30] <notenoughgirls> atton's interactions with him are also funny and they help make mira more likable when she neggs him
[1:58:33] <subjectg> because clearly money is how to get people to listen
[1:58:35] <derap41> Int characters are almost always the best way to go around its hard to balance int
[1:58:36] <Kirbachev> @andrei11dr They're under a publisher. It's why Outer Worlds ended up on Epic first.
[1:58:39] <Redblood801> Behold, the birth of the first battle droid
[1:58:42] <Redblood801> Roger Roger
[1:58:58] <vulkan_vibes> roger roger *later
[1:59:01] <derap41> Animals aren't evil
[1:59:01] <dinnydanny777> If Obsidian had more money would they make better games?
[1:59:07] <Iwashi94> smh John
[1:59:12] <$GabeSweetMan> MODERN DAY
[1:59:14] <DatAsuna> @Gruhunchously that and he's a soft spoken character which for some reason just automatically makes like 30% of players hate you
[1:59:18] <%phatmac16> JOHN IS CANCELLED
[1:59:19] <lotharrio> For bringing these suicide bombers back to life, I DEMAND lightside points.
[1:59:19] <vulkan_vibes> Obdlsidian start a go fund me
[1:59:20] <DSD24> @dinnydanny777 I think more time would help as well
[1:59:23] <Fuji808> Does anybody know if The Outer World's will get any expansions?
[1:59:26] <%Gruhunchously> The big room at the back
[1:59:41] <Redblood801> #CancelJohnWilliams
[1:59:43] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I winder how much John makes every time the Main Theme plays LUL
[1:59:46] <Kirbachev> @derap41 D&D rules try to balance that with Wis and Cha characters having their own benefits to dialogue. It's hard to balance hard skill point bonuses, though.
[1:59:46] <derap41> @dinnydanny777 Well The Outer World was good until the budget ran out
[1:59:50] <%andrex2311> Big room for big light boys
[1:59:53] <%Zohare> @andrei11dr EA had nothing to do with kotor 1 and 2
[2:00:09] <DSD24> @Fuji808 The said they would make DLC but there's been no news
[2:00:12] <subjectg> @datasuna i’d imagine sounding smarmy and his introduction being a big ol exposition dump didn’t help endear on first impression
[2:00:16] <%phatmac16> DUNDUNYAYYAY
[2:00:21] <+DorianCreed> Chug chug chug chug chug
[2:00:22] <Redblood801> Delete some saves
[2:00:22] <%kapcommunist> he dies from circle breathing
[2:00:26] <alrobot2014> is it about the number of saves?
[2:00:29] <+DorianCreed> Delete some of those saves
[2:00:30] <%ChoculaUltra> that was my problem with the Outer Worlds. You could feel the quality go down as your gametime went up.
[2:00:35] <$Invlux> chugging
[2:00:37] <%BallerSwagBro9k> KING CRIMSON
[2:00:39] <+oldneckbeard> 14 months
[2:00:40] <andrei11dr> I should probably play Pillars 2 , i never got around to it
[2:00:44] <%phatmac16> YES PLEASE
[2:00:45] <%Malik1002> infinite sukuyome
[2:00:46] <derap41> @Kirbachev Yeah but specifically in video games its hard to have int whille the player can fudge other stuff
[2:00:49] <DatAsuna> @subjectg didn't hurt kreia :P
[2:00:50] <%andrex2311> YES DO PLZ
[2:00:51] <%Gruhunchously> They really are
[2:00:51] <DSD24> @ChoculaUltra Also the combat is pretty ho hum
[2:00:52] <Imsoverylazy> Budget doesn't necessarily equal quality. Modern Warfare 2, adjusted for inflation, costed about $300 million, and it was just alright.
[2:00:56] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Sequels were DOA
[2:00:58] <Redblood801> Remember when Poe went to the fart wedding
[2:01:00] <%R3Roundabout> Toys from the sequel don't sell as well
[2:01:00] <$GabeSweetMan> Sto-hohohooooop! THey're already deaaaaaad!
[2:01:08] <Chisas_Dead_Body> That many saves ain’t good
[2:01:09] <%ChoculaUltra> @DSD24 oh definitely. It got super fucking old super fast.
[2:01:11] <andrei11dr> I beat Pillars 1 though, witch was really good
[2:01:11] <+DorianCreed> @WoolieVersus This chugging is because you have over a hundred saves. Delete some - go down to twenty or so
[2:01:17] <%phatmac16> BBY dates?
[2:01:18] <%alpacasintophats> Nah let’s kick that corpse of a trilogy harder!
[2:01:21] <derap41> Disney wants to change history
[2:01:25] <derap41> Fucking evil
[2:01:26] <$GabeSweetMan> "We have always owned the concept of fiction."
[2:01:28] <xiccy> I wanna beat Pillars 1 and Tyranny before I move onto Pillars 2
[2:01:31] <JetpackMcQuack> Disney wants to Pucci star wars
[2:01:32] <dinnydanny777> Idk, if you already make good games but you get a higher budget then in theory you can make better games
[2:01:44] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Walt Disney in Stan Lee vs
[2:01:44] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:01:47] <subjectg> @datasuna there’s fancy smarm and there’s mystical smarm, kreia at the very least didn’t have the prince charming accent
[2:01:50] <dinnydanny777> Bring back Kyle Katarn
[2:01:50] <%ChoculaUltra> remember that time Disney said it was hard to make the new trilogy because they didn't have any source material to build off of?
[2:01:54] <xiccy> I'm in the middle of both now
[2:01:57] <dinnydanny777> Kyle Katarn deserves to be canon
[2:01:58] <notenoughgirls> that droid scared me
[2:02:02] <AvailableThor> people will let it slide
[2:02:14] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Walt Disney in Stan Lee vs Jim Henson was so on point of hoe Disney is LUL
[2:02:18] <%Mrbaconator> ha
[2:02:19] <%Zohare> Marching band coming through
[2:02:23] <DatAsuna> Kyle won't ever be canon
[2:02:24] <derap41> Its a Disney product now Woolie they need to remove it from Lucas
[2:02:33] <%GraceTBM> goodwill=/= brand recognition
[2:02:33] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WAT?
[2:02:35] <%JohnAtDawn> Ah not this simp
[2:02:36] <%FallenAngelZelos> oh shit
[2:02:37] <$GabeSweetMan> @ChoculaUltra Kathleen Kennedy specifically but yes, that was the dumbest thing out of a Disney exec possibly in the history of franchise management.
[2:02:40] <%SirGO0SE> theyre trading the fan base they had for the fan base they want
[2:02:47] <%SirGO0SE> its sad
[2:02:48] <Deadbulky> Simp
[2:02:53] <StarlitStunner> Mical is a dork
[2:02:56] <DSD24> Ah but your a guy so I can't join you

[2:03:10] <olaksi> Game's husbando game is kinda awful
[2:03:10] <$GabeSweetMan> HUH
[2:03:12] <+kewlmyc> boooo
[2:03:12] <ZeeJiggle> I feel like this is a weird place for this guy and conversation, but I guess nowhere else was good
[2:03:15] <lotharrio> This is Simp-prime.
[2:03:16] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Male Companion #18
[2:03:18] <derap41> Nah he is lame
[2:03:21] <dinnydanny777> Does anyone really think the sequels are better than both of the other trilogies though
[2:03:21] <Manly_Rose> He is fine
[2:03:25] <%phatmac16> WHERE MY HUSBANDOS AT???
[2:03:27] <Manly_Rose> Boring but fine
[2:03:27] <+DorianCreed> Is this replaced with Handmaiden in this scene if you're a woman?
[2:03:29] <andrei11dr> He sucks, MASSIVE DICKS THO
[2:03:30] <Vyskus> Disciple is forgettable at best
[2:03:32] <derap41> Unless you use the Sith console powers
[2:03:34] <$GabeSweetMan> But blindfolded goth chick is [louad sweating]
[2:03:38] <dinnydanny777> His voice sucks
[2:03:39] <+Risingxiv> Liquid?
[2:03:41] <JetpackMcQuack> Look at his plastic haircut
[2:03:41] <sendart> what is up with his teeth
[2:03:41] <%Chatterbox1991> the pattern of behavior that started with Mass Effect 3, continued with Battlefield V and reached its zenith with Star Wars
[2:03:44] <%MichaelDood> Oh Mr. Darcy! Kreygasm
[2:03:50] <+grim_alex95> This is deSIMPle atpRtsd4
[2:03:52] <tuesti> @DorianCreed no, this is where you meet disciple no matter what
[2:03:54] <%Irridium> @DorianCreed Nah Handmaiden just stays on Telos.
[2:03:57] <dinnydanny777> His voice is so bland
[2:03:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I think we hate him because everything about him SCREAMS DEFAULT
[2:03:58] <DSD24> @DorianCreed Handmaiden just doesn't join you on Atris's planet and instead Disciple joins you here
[2:04:04] <derap41> The Sith Transmutation power
[2:04:04] <JetpackMcQuack> It's just prince charming from Shrek
[2:04:11] <olaksi> Yeah, he's just bland
[2:04:18] <vulkan_vibes> Simpiple
[2:04:22] <%phatmac16> ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[2:04:38] <$Invlux> Is it theft if you owned it originally\
[2:04:45] <dinnydanny777> He has a really fat face
[2:04:48] <$GabeSweetMan> I'm kinda bored of the trend in VAing of "Vaguely british accent"
[2:04:52] <dinnydanny777> His face is super wide
[2:04:53] <olaksi> Is there a mod to replace handmaiden for female Exile?
[2:05:02] <derap41> He has that 2000s DiCaprio hair
[2:05:05] <%Gruhunchously> There is
[2:05:08] <andrei11dr> As someone that first played this as Dark Side female, i hate this guy
[2:05:12] <dinnydanny777> It's like a super boring Englishbaccent though
[2:05:12] <JetpackMcQuack> These people need to back up their holocrons off site
[2:05:15] <PunkZedB> he looks like the bad guy in one of thos skiing movies where he wants to build a shopping mall over the resort
[2:05:17] <notenoughgirls> okay he is pretty correct here though
[2:05:20] <DatAsuna> Arca jeth!
[2:05:23] <%FallenAngelZelos> I know that cranky black man!
[2:05:23] <ZeeJiggle> Bindo name drop!
[2:05:24] <%SirGO0SE> i know that name PogChamp
[2:05:24] <%andrex2311> yeee
[2:05:25] <%Gruhunchously> jolee Bindo
[2:05:30] <$GabeSweetMan> Poor Jolee
[2:05:32] <lotharrio> He was a smuggler for awhile, right?
[2:05:34] <%Mrbaconator> whose line is it anyway
[2:05:40] <ZeeJiggle> Pulling a Bindo. That was with Handmaiden.
[2:05:43] <Vyskus> Jolee is the fuckin best
[2:05:44] <damienlunas> The Rimworld is the name of a brothel
[2:05:44] <%BallerSwagBro9k> The fact that hes also called Disciple is so lazy
[2:05:47] <asurite_warrior> dangit man
[2:06:03] <%andrex2311> oof
[2:06:07] <derap41> A long long time ago
[2:06:11] <+DorianCreed> Stardate: 4000 fuckin' years ago
[2:06:12] <%andrex2311> FeelsBadMan
[2:06:14] <Explodincatz> back in MY day
[2:06:17] <JetpackMcQuack> How do these cultures survive
[2:06:18] <$GabeSweetMan> LUL
[2:06:19] <%BallerSwagBro9k> in a galaxy far away
[2:06:19] <ZeeJiggle> Starguments is strong.
[2:06:22] <Redblood801> Just wait for 300 years, shit gets super fucked up then
[2:06:23] <DatAsuna> Star One War ever
[2:06:25] <dinnydanny777> Hey I'm curious, he has an English accent right?
[2:06:28] <$GabeSweetMan> That's strong. Stargumentation.
[2:06:29] <dinnydanny777> Is he evil?
[2:06:34] <Kiyosuki> go see a Star War
[2:06:36] <%DemonOfSalt> @DatAsuna I sent my first message in between casts, but I don't know if it was seen during this cast.
[2:06:39] <DSD24> @BallerSwagBro9k Well its a title just like Handmaiden so its pretty on brand
[2:06:41] <dinnydanny777> What's his murder count btw
[2:06:51] <dinnydanny777> He has the English accent you know
[2:06:56] <derap41> He has really big teeth
[2:06:56] <DatAsuna> @Redblood801 ironically the republic is in a way better place by then. lol
[2:07:08] <Deadbulky> Both for sure
[2:07:09] <%andrex2311> LUL
[2:07:11] <Halospaz117> @dinnydanny777 Eh Bastilla had one... though considering the timeline this playthrough is in I suppose that doesn't help much
[2:07:15] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Fun Fact: in French Star Wars is tranlated as: The War of the Stars
[2:07:21] <derap41> IT looks like he's wearing dentures
[2:07:28] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @DSD24 But at least she has a name
[2:07:35] <Deadbulky> TRUE
[2:07:40] <lotharrio> I mean a huge number WERE Jedi.
[2:07:45] <vulkan_vibes> I have always hated his teeth.
[2:07:53] <olaksi> @dinnydanny777 American writers replacing personality with british accents since forever
[2:07:53] <JetpackMcQuack> Sith dress like the Cure, that's the difference
[2:07:55] <DSD24> @BallerSwagBro9k Oh wait I thought he got a name, my bad
[2:07:55] <Redblood801> @DatAsuna They're in such a good place that they let Courascant get fucking sacked
[2:07:57] <prince_johnny_> oh yea pat said this
[2:08:00] <dinnydanny777> Yeah Bastilla was English too but basically every member of the Empire and most of the Sith are also English
[2:08:00] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Nope
[2:08:05] <alrobot2014> La guerre des étoiles? @BallerSwagBro9k
[2:08:07] <DatAsuna> @DemonOfSalt If you used channel pointss to highlight message they definitely didn't see it. What you want is the donate button under the video player, has a kirby icon on it. They see those later for sure.
[2:08:32] <andrei11dr> Ok ,Earth Federation or The Republic, witch one are bigger dicks ?
[2:08:35] <%Gruhunchously> Option 2 looks interesting
[2:08:40] <DSD24> A Jedi's Life is Sacrifice
[2:08:44] <%SirGO0SE> JOJO
[2:08:45] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @alrobot2014 Oui
[2:08:45] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:08:49] <dinnydanny777> If you don't get to talk to him again go nuts with the dialogue
[2:08:52] <ShiningAxis> droids running laps
[2:08:53] <dinnydanny777> Just be a dick
[2:09:00] <dinnydanny777> There's zero consequences
[2:09:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @DSD24 Ooops sorry i just chekced he does have a name Mical. I never knew that
[2:09:12] <%DemonOfSalt> @DatAsuna Thanks!
[2:09:13] <%phatmac16> Good examples
[2:09:16] <lotharrio> Sarumon or Sauron?
[2:09:23] <%phatmac16> Sarumon
[2:09:31] <tuesti> with the long white hair! which??
[2:09:33] <%Gruhunchously> Exar Kun didn't even switch to a red lightsaber when he fell
[2:09:33] <derap41> The one with shit on his face?
[2:09:34] <DSD24> @BallerSwagBro9k Oh cool its all good then!
[2:09:38] <dinnydanny777> Gandalf is the one with the fireworks factory
[2:09:40] <Ashenik1> The one who is an ashole , oh wait
[2:09:42] <DatAsuna> @DemonOfSalt No problem, happy to help especially since it seems to mean a lot to you
[2:09:43] <+mechslayer71> @lotharrio One of those make much more sense in this analogy than the other
[2:09:49] <andrei11dr> It's Ryu and Ken
[2:09:54] <dinnydanny777> Gandalf has FIREWORKS tho
[2:09:56] <goldman5tackz> goldman5tackz subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:09:57] <+DorianCreed> That old dude with a staff and a beard in white
[2:10:10] <%MrRabbles> but from my perspective . . .
[2:10:17] <DatAsuna> @DorianCreed so ahsoka? :P
[2:10:20] <olaksi> About that
[2:10:21] <derap41> Fucking buck teeth but worse
[2:10:21] <%FallenAngelZelos> one of them rides a horse!!! Nailed it
[2:10:32] <Redblood801> Ironically, the Jedi never learn from the past
[2:10:32] <JetpackMcQuack> Jebaited
[2:10:34] <+DorianCreed> @DatAsuna Close enough
[2:10:42] <tuesti> his conversations are interesting tbh
[2:10:45] <dinnydanny777> This guy has to be evil he seems too plain
[2:10:45] <+DorianCreed> Also "SUPPOSED to"

[2:14:06] <%BallerSwagBro9k> According to Zack Snyder only 1/4 of the film we saw will remain
[2:14:18] <%BallerSwagBro9k> everything else will be new
[2:14:18] <$GabeSweetMan> Real Talk about Snyder cut: I can't WAIT. I don't care about that film so either way I win. Either it becomes a GOOD MOVIE, or I get to watch people have a meltdown.
[2:14:20] <+eanscrale> They were VERY convincing

[2:14:32] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @GabeSweetMan My thoughts exactly

[2:16:10] <andrei11dr> Malak was just totally jawless Kappa
[2:16:10] <%Gruhunchously> Kreia serously fucks with this guy if he joins the party
[2:16:12] <$GabeSweetMan> @DSD24 No one can know if something in the future will be good or not, you can only judge in hindsight.
[2:16:12] <dinnydanny777> This guy sucks
[2:16:13] <ZeeJiggle> This dude's just reading shit off of Wookiepedia.
[2:16:19] <Redblood801> MLA Style man
[2:16:21] <dinnydanny777> He's so pure it's boring
[2:16:42] <dinnydanny777> This is like that guy who's never even crossed the street without looking
[2:16:43] <SnaKemuho> he's a Barth, with B standing for Boring
[2:16:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Actors of JL are coming back to shoot new scenes, ect
[2:16:57] <dinnydanny777> Like once in his life
[2:16:57] <%Gruhunchously> Brexit
[2:16:57] <derap41> He ends every dialogue with a goofy as toothy smile

[2:17:05] <$GabeSweetMan> Oh they *are* having reshoots?
[2:17:09] <andrei11dr> He has some interesting stuff going on, but i fucking hate him
[2:17:23] <+DorianCreed> This dude isn't the Disciple, he's the Blandmaiden, Master of Monotone Lore Dumps
[2:17:24] <dinnydanny777> Oh I do, I meant he's never ever like been in a rush and crossed without looking
[2:17:28] <olaksi> It's kind of how Kaiden Alenko would be a super interesting dude in real life as an oprhan special forces guy, but sir, this is video games
[2:17:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THE SNYDER CUT WILL BE NEARLY 4 HOURS. I REPEAT NERALY 4 HOYRS
[2:17:34] <AvailableThor> Yeah but then hungry boi happened.

[2:17:41] <$GabeSweetMan> @DorianCreed Blandmaiden is strong.
[2:17:41] <ZeeJiggle> He wears all of his interesting stuff right here. In party he's just kinda nothin', except for MAYBE a few things but I don't remember
[2:17:42] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 17 minutes

[2:18:40] <alrobot2014> atris is made to be hated
[2:18:42] <$GabeSweetMan> "I was being dumb on purpose!"
[2:18:48] <Redblood801> She

[2:18:52] <andrei11dr> She's the real villain

[2:18:56] <%andrex2311> woolieGIRLS woolieMIRIN
[2:19:00] <+DorianCreed> @WoolieVersus Atris is the real villain, and she's a massive bitch
[2:19:00] <%phatmac16> SHE'S A BITCH
[2:19:08] <%TheFabledAble> @WoolieVersus that screen is supposed to set up your expectations to be subverted
[2:19:11] <crepe_jedi> bitchyness aint hot
[2:19:17] <tuesti> atris is an asshole
[2:19:19] <%MrRabbles> if you play female jedi you can treat her like an angry little sister
[2:19:20] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @DatAsuna
[2:19:23] <olaksi> What if you gave her a hat?
[2:19:24] <%andrex2311> wait I am subed ?!
[2:19:40] <%andrex2311> thanks to however gave it to me!! woolieGASM
[2:19:42] <DSD24> People are into that
[2:19:47] <$GabeSweetMan> Now I am curious what Asuna yelled.
[2:19:47] <andrei11dr> Look at me ,im commenting right now Kappa
[2:19:48] <AvailableThor> Oh right, Atris fighting Nihilus, the scene that TOTALLY happens in the game and is not a red herring at all.
[2:19:50] <derap41> So women are like chocolate?
[2:20:00] <%afronooch> Im into that
[2:20:03] <%Gruhunchously> Mom says it's MY turn to fly the ship!
[2:20:17] <dinnydanny777> Is there ever a point when the republic is not "fragile"?
[2:20:20] <derap41> When has the Republic not been fragile ?
[2:20:21] <lotharrio> Atris is just spinning her wheels, drinking wine and shit talking Fann on Spacebook.
[2:20:31] <$GabeSweetMan> Mom says it's MY turn to drive the Jedi!
[2:20:36] <+MidnightBurst12> E C H O E S
[2:20:53] <dinnydanny777> It seems like basically every year in the Republic it's about to break down completely
[2:21:06] <$GabeSweetMan> lmao
[2:21:06] <derap41> hmm
[2:21:11] <lotharrio> Yup, invasive species.
[2:21:13] <Redblood801> Probably
[2:21:16] <derap41> Could be
[2:21:22] <dinnydanny777> Nice
[2:21:23] <andrei11dr> Because 14 months
[2:21:25] <ralphfromdk> Yes, because it's the only thing that works :l
[2:21:28] <derap41> He is exposition man
[2:21:28] <DatAsuna> @dinnydanny777 in swtor the republic is actually fairly solid for most of the story.
[2:21:30] <%Bluemanzee> "This planet needs animals. Toss those things from there over here."
[2:21:37] <$Invlux> Fuckin BBC history man
[2:21:39] <DSD24> Personality is guy
[2:21:44] <dinnydanny777> Does that mean there are planets out there which are completely dead because of animals being tossed on them
[2:21:46] <DatAsuna> If anything they're too solid and start swinging their dick around too hard.
[2:21:54] <damienlunas> Personality is Plain Yogurt
[2:22:00] <+Proxzo> Is woolie gonna play Panel De Pon?
[2:22:04] <DSD24> Its Wonder Bread
[2:22:09] <+Proxzo> It's up on NSonline
[2:22:11] <dinnydanny777> Swinging their dick around too hard started the war in KOTOR1 though anyway right?
[2:22:17] <notenoughgirls> he's not wrong
[2:22:22] <$Invlux> Milquetoast
[2:22:29] <tuesti> he gets very little personality, you only taste it when he goes back and forth with atton
[2:22:34] <Ashenik1> TheSnyderCut is real holy shit.....
[2:22:34] <%JohnAtDawn> Those droid steps in the background are fucking annoying.
[2:22:38] <derap41> File down your fucking teeth
[2:22:44] <dinnydanny777> This is basically just exposition
[2:23:04] <notenoughgirls> his back and forth with atton also brings out mira's negging
[2:23:04] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:23:05] <superelitejimi> @Ashenik1 i literally just read about it on google, i had no idea snyder's daughter died
[2:23:06] <DatAsuna> @dinnydanny777 That was the mandos starting it.
[2:23:07] <$GabeSweetMan> wuh happuh
[2:23:17] <dinnydanny777> I just realised that this kind of gives me a similar feeling to David Cage talking into the camera
[2:23:34] <%Gruhunchously> Oh man, don't do this guy dirty like that
[2:23:53] <$GabeSweetMan> Hmmmmmmm
[2:23:55] <DSD24> Ooooooof
[2:23:57] <derap41> Hmmm
[2:23:59] <$Invlux> Anybody see Tencent is is taking the System Shock franchise? lol
[2:24:05] <derap41> They could have done that
[2:24:13] <MarkUriah> `
[2:24:15] <JetpackMcQuack> Araki forgot
[2:24:21] <DSD24> What if they did it bad though
[2:24:21] <$GabeSweetMan> They made it WORSE in fact.
[2:24:22] <Safarihat> @Invlux they are taking over the world
[2:24:23] <+eanscrale> Nooooooo
[2:24:24] <olaksi> KOTOR is way too niche to be referenced in the movies
[2:24:29] <notenoughgirls> that would have been marginally less stupid than an indoctrinated "population"
[2:24:36] <andrei11dr> I like his name is just Frodo LUL
[2:24:45] <DatAsuna> Even just "he was mothballing the old ISD-1s for years" was cooler
[2:24:50] <$GabeSweetMan> There is no Elijah, only Frodo.
[2:24:53] <Redblood801> They had 1000 options and picked the worst one
[2:24:58] <%Gruhunchously> But then they would have to spend a whole other movie explaining the Infinite Empire
[2:25:01] <derap41> Are they making Space Pirates of the Caribbean ?
[2:25:03] <+MidnightBurst12> Death troopers story when? Kappa
[2:25:08] <derap41> That would be dope
[2:25:23] <DSD24> The Death Troopers book was cool
[2:25:25] <+doc_ock_rokc> Shit im late what did I miss!
[2:25:33] <andrei11dr> Well, they did have that Order of Reeven thing
[2:25:38] <derap41> Grey Goo
[2:25:48] <olaksi> I thought Star Forge was powered by a sun though
[2:25:50] <derap41> Grey Goo can do anything
[2:25:55] <%FallenAngelZelos> @doc_ock_rokc Exploring the enclave. Talking to party member that would have joined us if we were fem exile now
[2:25:58] <RedSqurrl> "Just because we have the Force doesn't mean we can do everything." vs. "Hey we have the Force, we can do anything."
[2:25:59] <subjectg> but they don’t have source material, remember?
[2:26:00] <AvailableThor> My interpretation when watching the movie was that those were ancient Sith ships, considering that the planet was an ancient Sith planet. It made sense to me that the ship designs of the Empire would be based on ancient Sith ships designs, and yes, I thought they were baiscally zombie ships.
[2:26:05] <%Zohare> @doc_ock_rokc They went through most of the enclave and have been speaking to this lore dump
[2:26:06] <dinnydanny777> The shadowtrooper lightsaber blocking armour stuff got made canon right?
[2:26:06] <derap41> @olaksi suns are kinda cold fusion
[2:26:09] <notenoughgirls> who cares if they namedropped revan it literally does not mean anything
[2:26:13] <Psyramics> did they need a secret population? Couldn't they be staffed be clones?
[2:26:18] <+doc_ock_rokc> Shit thats some fun stuff
[2:26:20] <olaksi> @derap41 You got me there
[2:26:28] <derap41> They just forgot about the Star Fleet
[2:26:32] <+Theworld732> It should’ve just been an ancient ass Sith fleet from the old days
[2:26:47] <Treuan> @notenoughgirls They name drop Revan to build hype for TOR obviously
[2:26:49] <%FallenAngelZelos> I frickin hate that knife!!!
[2:26:51] <$GabeSweetMan> Knife that uses RUINS!
[2:26:53] <Kivros> star forge is a replicator from star trek
[2:26:54] <+CelebrityGhost> sith farmers
[2:26:55] <Iwashi94> what do they eat
[2:26:56] <derap41> What do they eat?
[2:26:59] <$GabeSweetMan> WHY DOES IT LINE UP WITH RUINS?!
[2:27:00] <DSD24> What do they eat?
[2:27:01] <Augus7717> @WoolieVersus snoke clone soup
[2:27:01] <DSD24> dang it
[2:27:01] <+eanscrale> But the logistics
[2:27:06] <derap41> @Iwashi94 mrbtounge?
[2:27:10] <%Gruhunchously> An army of Palpatine clones?
[2:27:10] <ralphfromdk> Snoke Burgers
[2:27:11] <$Invlux> goddamn stupid death star wreckage knife! fuck
[2:27:11] <dinnydanny777> It nearly sounds like J J Abrams just copied films he liked without thinking about how it actually works inside of it's own story...
[2:27:13] <alrobot2014> soylent green is palpatine?
[2:27:19] <%afronooch> DSF
[2:27:24] <+griffball13> it is noted that the force can sustain a jedi or sith
[2:27:24] <andrei11dr> @notenoughgirls No it doesn't, but im surprised they recognized that KOTOR even exists
[2:27:24] <JetpackMcQuack> Snoke-In-A-Can is real, why now Palp-In-A-Can
[2:27:25] <$GabeSweetMan> Palpatine was behind it!
[2:27:28] <notenoughgirls> jj abrams is a hack
[2:27:29] <%andrex2311> palpatine meat! woolieF woolieU
[2:27:29] <$legacy0117> That is insane.
[2:27:33] <Redblood801> Wait, so if Ilum is detroyed, where are new Jedi supposed to get their crystals?
[2:27:38] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @KaitlynnHere
[2:27:43] <+eanscrale> All they had to do with star trek it
[2:27:49] <superelitejimi> jj has ruined both star trek and star wars...
[2:27:49] <+eanscrale> but they din't even do that
[2:27:50] <derap41> The Answer is don't think about it
[2:28:02] <derap41> because they sure didn't
[2:28:03] <SereneFox> Well, Palpatine has been shown as being able to clone himself at least, soooo infinite food?
[2:28:05] <KaitlynnHere> If they had clone machines... then why didn’t they use it to make an army?
[2:28:07] <%LordSDB> It was me Yoda! It was me all along! woolieMIRIN
[2:28:09] <MarkUriah> And a husk of a person powered by the Dark Side isn't new. Darth Vader
[2:28:13] <subjectg> pop scifi exists to be ruined these days
[2:28:17] <+doc_ock_rokc> @dinnydanny777 KK is more the reason why everything sucked
[2:28:20] <notenoughgirls> honestly the fact that they destroyed starkiller base in e7 was probably a mistake
[2:28:24] <KaitlynnHere> Why did they have to kidnap peeps
[2:28:25] <+lazylazzer> Jojo part 5 vibes
[2:28:25] <andrei11dr> Unless you're Josuke
[2:28:34] <ralphfromdk> Funny how in 4-5-6 it took months and years to build a single Deathstar
[2:28:36] <%kapcommunist> the only thing stronger than plot armor; plot phoenix down
[2:28:37] <olaksi> It's funny how Hollywood producers are so obsessed with building cinematic universes but also think actually building an universe is not palatable enough to put in a movie
[2:28:37] <SnaKemuho> unless it's Worm
[2:28:40] <KaitlynnHere> It’s a movie, don’t think about it
[2:28:42] <%Gruhunchously> MIDICHLORIANS SON
[2:28:45] <+doc_ock_rokc> Josuke couldn't heal himself
[2:28:47] <%gasb1> @redblood801 they can make artificial ones Luke green lightsaber uses a artificial one
[2:29:10] <derap41> @olaksi cinematic universe is the "block chain" of producer spiel
[2:29:19] <%Gruhunchously> Well...
[2:29:28] <%MrRabbles> Malek was present
[2:29:30] <SnaKemuho> Obsidian are dunking on him as hard as they can
[2:29:32] <Ashenik1> @olaksi just check out James Camerons Avatar drama
[2:29:34] <ZeeJiggle> 'cause Malak is just "Yea I'm tha VILLAIN"
[2:29:35] <DSD24> Revan had better fashion sense
[2:29:38] <$GabeSweetMan> @derap41 That's super on point. It's just buzz words.
[2:29:40] <+doc_ock_rokc> Yeah
[2:29:40] <notenoughgirls> almost like malak is a 1-note villain
[2:29:42] <andrei11dr> Malak was kinda of an loser
[2:29:43] <KaitlynnHere> Malek was a lackey
[2:29:44] <+doc_ock_rokc> YEAH
[2:29:45] <%MrRabbles> Malek showed up for class
[2:29:46] <%Gruhunchously> Malak was just a dumb idiot guy
[2:29:52] <Ashenik1> Revan is basically Julius Ceasar
[2:29:52] <DatAsuna> The comic even has Zayne cuck malak
[2:29:58] <%Gruhunchously> He rode off of Revan's coat-tails
[2:29:58] <%phatmac16> He's Scotty Pippin
[2:29:59] <ralphfromdk> Bioware writing vs Obsidian writing :D
[2:30:02] <+doc_ock_rokc> Malek was an idioticly lucky asshat
[2:30:04] <superelitejimi> malak is sakura
[2:30:04] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1262613184097255426
[2:30:17] <Redblood801> And then there's Malek! He's dead...
[2:30:17] <%kapcommunist> kukoc
[2:30:19] <%FallenAngelZelos> @superelitejimi whoa whoa whoa let's not get crazy now
[2:30:19] <dinnydanny777> I liked Rogue One more than Episode 7
[2:30:21] <$GabeSweetMan> And he was there.
[2:30:22] <derap41> @GabeSweetMan it gets the investors wet and that's all that matter weather you put in the work doesn't matter they are already imaginign Marvel money
[2:30:24] <Joostebrood> yeah that ain't shifty at all
[2:30:26] <%MrRabbles> Malek puppies when
[2:30:28] <KaitlynnHere> Malak deserved to get his jaw cut off
[2:30:41] <+doc_ock_rokc> @dinnydanny777 its the only good disney starwars
[2:30:43] <RedSqurrl> Cuz you're not a guuuuurl
[2:30:44] <%phatmac16> Rouge One is alright, the characters are too boring
[2:30:51] <andrei11dr> Both Nihillus and Sion are eons above Malak
[2:30:53] <ralphfromdk> Is he a clone? :o
[2:30:55] <dinnydanny777> The droid in Rogue One is great though
[2:30:59] <%Gruhunchously> That is the most suspicions answer I've heard today, and I've been hanging out with KREIA
[2:31:18] <dinnydanny777> You're never gonna speak to this guy again right?
[2:31:23] <dinnydanny777> Follow your heart
[2:31:23] <derap41> Rouge One wasn't actively making me angry so it probably at the top Solo was ok
[2:31:29] <DSD24> 3 sounds good
[2:31:33] <Chisas_Dead_Body> Carth answer
[2:31:34] <KaitlynnHere> I’d tell him to suck it
[2:31:36] <%Bluemanzee> @dinnydanny777 Alan Tudyk is almost always great
[2:31:36] <Deadbulky> Id pick 4
[2:31:37] <Dementedpenguin> I don't think it was a coincidence that I liked Rogue One the moment it started seguing into Episode IV
[2:31:39] <+doc_ock_rokc> 2 or 3
[2:31:47] <DatAsuna> then say 2
[2:31:52] <olaksi> @phatmac16 If they rewrote the first half it'd be hands down the best of the new movies
[2:31:55] <KaitlynnHere> Carth did this to me! He must pay!
[2:31:57] <$GabeSweetMan> Getting answers is vague yet honest.
[2:32:03] <superelitejimi> i'd like to explore trilla's sith cave
[2:32:24] <%Gruhunchously> Where have you been the last few years
[2:32:37] <+doc_ock_rokc> Bitch are you for real
[2:32:41] <derap41> This guy needs to lisp a lot more with those teeth
[2:32:41] <dinnydanny777> Wow
[2:32:46] <+sunriser101> man what a boring character
[2:32:48] <DSD24> Byeeeee
[2:32:48] <Redblood801> Khoonda sounds like a slur
[2:32:51] <Deadbulky> Byeeeee
[2:32:53] <dinnydanny777> This man slandering the Sith right here
[2:32:59] <notenoughgirls> okay wow he actually acknowledged how loud the empires are
[2:32:59] <DatAsuna> Revan's sith were actually pretty bad because they couldn't do anything without him
[2:33:06] <KaitlynnHere> @sunriser101 I know right? He doesn’t even have titties
[2:33:07] <+doc_ock_rokc> @Redblood801 it probably became one
[2:33:10] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus Also he's a spy for Carth
[2:33:14] <DSD24> Girl you
[2:33:15] <+griffball13> SIMP
[2:33:17] <dinnydanny777> Oh so he's a super boring love interest
[2:33:20] <%Gruhunchously> S I M P
[2:33:27] <%phatmac16> HE SIMPIN
[2:33:30] <derap41> S I M P
[2:33:34] <subjectg> g u t l e s s s i m p
[2:33:34] <olaksi> @DatAsuna She 100% intended it that way too
[2:33:38] <$GabeSweetMan> Whelp
[2:33:38] <dinnydanny777> Does he get naked when you train too?
[2:33:41] <%shry2049> if he breathes, he's a simp
[2:33:42] <DSD24> Guys the Exile isn't mediocre
[2:33:43] <giovanni1239> CUCK SIMP
[2:33:58] <+DorianCreed> Blandmaiden be simpin'
[2:34:02] <andrei11dr> Also he's affiliated with Carth ,which is a double reason to hate him
[2:34:07] <DatAsuna> Specifically he works for carth if he's alive
[2:34:07] <+DorianCreed> And as we all know, simpin' ain't easy
[2:34:08] <StarlitStunner> Mical is weird
[2:34:22] <DSD24> Are you really a simp if the person you are pining for is a Rad Person?
[2:34:22] <dinnydanny777> This guy dropped out of Jedi college
[2:34:30] <$GabeSweetMan> Blandmaiden is a drop out.
[2:34:39] <tuesti> @DSD24 true
[2:34:43] <KaitlynnHere> @dinnydanny777 more like Jedi night school
[2:34:47] <%FallenAngelZelos> Karen
[2:34:51] <Klefth> Blandmaiden... Woooooow LUL
[2:34:57] <DatAsuna> He guesses the book
[2:35:00] <tuesti> yeah but kreia is like nah man fuck off
[2:35:01] <KaitlynnHere> @fallenangelzelos it’s Kyle when it’s a guy
[2:35:04] <derap41> He read the script
[2:35:04] <+doc_ock_rokc> Kreia then mindwhipes him
[2:35:08] <%Gruhunchously> He figures it out, and then Kreia wipes his memory
[2:35:19] <dinnydanny777> Wow
[2:35:20] <ALTRNico> D:
[2:35:23] <%kapcommunist> LUL
[2:35:23] <notenoughgirls> "shit man you could write a shitty book about all this"
[2:35:26] <blackskulldragon18> Wait what?
[2:35:27] <tuesti> gay
[2:35:28] <dinnydanny777> That's super lame haha
[2:35:30] <+DorianCreed> @Klefth Blandmaiden is specifically Mical, as opposed to Brianna
[2:35:34] <%andrex2311> she is gay
[2:35:36] <DatAsuna> She still simps
[2:35:41] <+doc_ock_rokc> @dinnydanny777 Kreia is great
[2:35:53] <subjectg> strange motherly-sisterly relationship
[2:36:01] <DSD24> We in there
[2:36:02] <$GabeSweetMan> Hot.
[2:36:04] <LeBlanc233> i played first time girl and she seemed uber in the closet in love with your character
[2:36:06] <DatAsuna> Non-sexual simping
[2:36:08] <lotharrio> You're the most shonen hero of all Jedi.
[2:36:09] <%andrex2311> Atris is a super simp, doesn't care if you are a girl
[2:36:19] <KaitlynnHere> Who wants to date a stalker?
[2:36:19] <Joostebrood> extremely boring
[2:36:20] <tuesti> atris gay
[2:36:22] <Deadbulky> Simp
[2:36:24] <Augus7717> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[2:36:24] <Thetruestblacksun> SLICK
[2:36:24] <DatAsuna> He wants the turth
[2:36:26] <+sunriser101> boring simp
[2:36:26] <ZeeJiggle> That WAS his personality.
[2:36:27] <dinnydanny777> Bland?
[2:36:27] <olaksi> I kind of like Bastila/Revan relationship more when it came off as sisterly instead of romantic
[2:36:31] <dinnydanny777> Meh?
[2:36:32] <$GabeSweetMan> BLANDMAIDEN
[2:36:33] <subjectg> that was it
[2:36:34] <+doc_ock_rokc> BLAND AS FUCK
[2:36:34] <ALTRNico> he simpin
[2:36:35] <dinnydanny777> Boring?
[2:36:36] <DSD24> Once again are you really a simp if the person you like are a Rad Person
[2:36:36] <+rottingpastry> simp
[2:36:38] <+sunriser101> he is blond carth
[2:36:39] <dinnydanny777> English?
[2:36:45] <%alpharius88> he is like anakin attack of the clones
[2:36:48] <dinnydanny777> He's... English?
[2:36:48] <+trustedgundam13> With Atris when your a girl its more of a sisterly relationship apparently. And she's upset that you left.
[2:36:49] <$GabeSweetMan> Vaguely Britishman
[2:36:49] <KaitlynnHere> Heh
[2:36:52] <tuesti> his banter with atton is the most personality you get
[2:37:02] <KaitlynnHere> Humor... in the Jedi?
[2:37:09] <a_mad_dragon> she's unflavoured yogurt, bland and a bit sour
[2:37:09] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:37:12] <%andrex2311> britsh LUL
[2:37:13] <+doc_ock_rokc> He isn't super good but is great for exposition
[2:37:13] <ZeeJiggle> He's "Story > Character", the character.
[2:37:17] <Chisas_Dead_Body> He has good banter with Atton
[2:37:24] <lotharrio> A pile of his victims.
[2:37:29] <andrei11dr> Hes the smart, goodie too shoes guy, FUCK HIM.
[2:37:31] <%ECRead> bland as a toast sandwich
[2:37:33] <ZeeJiggle> That's true, him and Atton have some fun moments.
[2:37:33] <+awkwardl0ser> Steam workshop mod let’s women get Handmaiden instead of this jagaloon, it’s a must for me
[2:37:41] <%Gruhunchously> He's British, that's his personality
[2:37:45] <+trustedgundam13> Disciple and Handmaiden are both kinda meh. But Disciple has more importance story wise.
[2:37:47] <Bassman_PhD> i first played this game when i was 12 and i was sad that i couldn't get him as a party member because "ew girls have cooties" lol
[2:37:51] <DSD24> I thought the whole point of a simp is someone who debases themselves for someone who is also pretty lame
[2:38:03] <ZeeJiggle> I wonder what cave that is.
[2:38:14] <Redblood801> Uggggh... Vrook
[2:38:16] <%Gruhunchously> Holobooks
[2:38:24] <notenoughgirls> the meaning of simp is kind of getting blurred
[2:38:28] <%Gruhunchously> There is no paper in Star Wars
[2:38:29] <tuesti> honestly
[2:38:29] <lotharrio> About 10 I guess?
[2:38:29] <dinnydanny777> When I see simp my mind immediately thinks simpleton
[2:38:29] <+doc_ock_rokc> @DSD24 its kinda taken the same mantel as cuck in slang
[2:38:31] <DatAsuna> like 6
[2:38:33] <andrei11dr> I had a good time with him on Dark Side tho because he's like, "So that's how it is huh!"
[2:38:38] <+Zanco23> A lot of the party members in KOTOR 2 seem monotone and bland to me: Bao-Dur, Mira, Visas, Disciple, Handmaiden...
[2:38:42] <dinnydanny777> I know that's wrong but my mind auto translates simp into simpleton
[2:38:43] <DSD24> @notenoughgirls That's what I'm saying! its confusing
[2:38:46] <Chisas_Dead_Body> It takes 1 atton
[2:38:54] <Daxalog> Their individual ipads
[2:38:57] <KaitlynnHere> You just look at them
[2:39:00] <RrenKrieg> the prequels show them right?
[2:39:09] <Safarihat> irrc you plug them into datapads
[2:39:11] <notenoughgirls> theyre like the disposable ipads from detroit become human
[2:39:11] <%antyriku2> uploads to your brain
[2:39:11] <RrenKrieg> obi-wan sat infront of a terminal
[2:39:12] <DSD24> @doc_ock_rokc That's pretty lame then
[2:39:21] <tuesti> whats paper? ipads only
[2:39:23] <lotharrio> Carve some shit into stone or something, Jedi. Come on.
[2:39:26] <DSD24> Nah V papercuts
[2:39:26] <Redblood801> Does paper even exist in Star Wars?
[2:39:26] <%Irridium> What, like a SAVAGE?!
[2:39:29] <+Proxzo> @WoolieVersus And then Luke Burns the Books
[2:39:29] <dinnydanny777> Isn't that the point though?
[2:39:30] <alrobot2014> imagine a future where bluetooth is reliable
[2:39:32] <KaitlynnHere> Thank you!
[2:39:33] <derap41> have redundancies
[2:39:33] <ralphfromdk> Like the Jedi did and Rei now has a bunch of old books? :D
[2:39:36] <DSD24> Force Papercut
[2:39:36] <RrenKrieg> weren't there like data terminals that people access like the PCs in libraries?
[2:39:37] <KaitlynnHere> Jeeesus
[2:39:41] <$GabeSweetMan> Well... libraries get burned easily too.
[2:39:43] <KaitlynnHere> I was just thinking that
[2:39:45] <dinnydanny777> But if you can't delete files how do you hide the clone laboratory on Kamino?
[2:39:45] <daniifanny> hey chat has Little V commented on the canceled fan remake for Kotor 1 yet? this is the first stream I've been on, I don't wanna bother them if he has spoken about it already
[2:39:47] <asurite_warrior> paper only really lasts around 20 years before shit starts to get flacky
[2:39:48] <andrei11dr> Don't they have written shit in the Jedi Temple?
[2:39:54] <$GabeSweetMan> Knowledge is transient by nature.
[2:39:55] <derap41> 1 backup is no backups
[2:39:59] <RrenKrieg> i remember when obi wan was looking for the clone planet he used a terminal
[2:40:03] <+doc_ock_rokc> @daniifanny I think so
[2:40:04] <dinnydanny777> The Library of Alexander burnt down right?
[2:40:10] <Chisas_Dead_Body> !uptime
[2:40:10] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 40 minutes
[2:40:11] <The_Nerd_Supreme> upload with knowledge to the cloud
[2:40:13] <notenoughgirls> kamino? never heard of it
[2:40:13] <akman14> Blade runner?
[2:40:15] <dinnydanny777> Like the largest library in the entire world burnt down
[2:40:15] <derap41> Library of Alexandria
[2:40:16] <+doc_ock_rokc> @dinnydanny777 yes
[2:40:25] <KaitlynnHere> Blane runner-u
[2:40:35] <+MidnightBurst12> can't the sun can do that for real?
[2:40:37] <KaitlynnHere> Yup
[2:40:37] <Redblood801> Can we get an F for the Library of Alexandria?
[2:40:40] <alrobot2014> F
[2:40:41] <dinnydanny777> F
[2:40:44] <KaitlynnHere> Blane
[2:40:45] <Thetruestblacksun> F
[2:40:45] <dinnydanny777> Gone too soon
[2:40:46] <notenoughgirls> dont give up skeleton
[2:40:48] <Project205> F
[2:40:48] <tuesti> but wouldnt there be backups on backups on backups?
[2:40:49] <asurite_warrior> Best way to store knowledge is to do it many ways
[2:40:59] <%shry2049> Blackout 2077 is a really good video
[2:40:59] <MarkUriah> Didn't Ghost Yoda burn down a library or something in the movies?
[2:41:12] <KaitlynnHere> The androids did it
[2:41:19] <%shry2049> sorry, 2022
[2:41:20] <+doc_ock_rokc> How much does he know aobut goto
[2:41:21] <dinnydanny777> I like the idea of Ghost Yoda being an arsonist
[2:41:22] <daniifanny> @doc_ock_rokc do you know what did he say?
[2:41:29] <+Zanco23> So is Ach-to supposed to be the Disney version of Tython, because it's got the ancient jedi texts on it? Like how in Disney the sith homeworld is Morriban rather than Korriban .
[2:41:29] <KaitlynnHere> @markuriah those aren’t cannon
[2:41:30] <%Irridium> I mean there's all the Native American history and stuff that's just gone because a lot of it was oral and... yeah
[2:41:36] <Redblood801> @MarkUriah He burnt the tree with the Sacred Texts
[2:41:40] <notenoughgirls> is that one character restored by the mod?
[2:41:51] <notenoughgirls> ive never gotten this far with it
[2:41:57] <derap41> @Irridium The same is true for almost all Oral tradition
[2:41:59] <clonexsniperx> is yoda a sith ghost cause he cast lightning?
[2:41:59] <+funnyfunnykid> Now THAT'S a Jedi

[2:49:26] <+Zanco23> Woolie appreciates women
[2:49:26] <$GabeSweetMan> @KaitlynnHere I'm glad the Mabel interpretation is picking up lol
[2:49:32] <+DorianCreed> Woolie and V so desperately want to McFucking MURDER this whiny bitch
[2:49:35] <derap41> This is porn level acting
[2:49:39] <%phatmac16> Hire a VA that needs work
[2:49:41] <blackskulldragon18> WHY
[2:49:45] <%afronooch> VA is listed as Usagi
[2:49:51] <%jiggy_snipe> surprised she doesn't ask you to "train" her Kappa
[2:49:57] <ALTRNico> she's a child Kappa
[2:49:59] <andrei11dr> This is HEAVY RAIN acting
[2:50:01] <a_mad_dragon> it would be nice if she was actually a sith trying to act like an innocent padawan
[2:50:03] <Space_Pagan> KILL THE YOUNGLINGS
[2:50:09] <Halospaz117> Did she?
[2:50:10] <Kivros> we taught her wrong as a joke
[2:50:12] <$GabeSweetMan> "We trained her stupid. As a joke!"
[2:50:12] <dinnydanny777> Jedi are super sheltered though
[2:50:12] <derap41> By doing favors for the teacher
[2:50:12] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Ki Adi Mundi did it
[2:50:16] <RrenKrieg> did she though?
[2:50:16] <Psyramics> how long has she been down here?
[2:50:16] <%Gruhunchously> She didn't, the academy got blown up
[2:50:19] <%jiggy_snipe> no you don't
[2:50:20] <$NoWayRyanTatum> Anakin wasnt lol
[2:50:21] <+eanscrale> It's Lisa from The Room!
[2:50:22] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> How long has it been since the war?
[2:50:23] <RrenKrieg> the academy exploded
[2:50:23] <ALTRNico> you should probably guide her then Kappa
[2:50:23] <dinnydanny777> Yeah but the Jedi are super sheltered
[2:50:23] <+dezimaly> hasnt she also been hiding here for a few years
[2:50:24] <cache_22> No Jedi left behind.
[2:50:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUCKY JANE
[2:50:28] <HorribleHog> her character seems a little nutty
[2:50:29] <%jiggy_snipe> you can be a good student and be an idiot still
[2:50:29] <Jonny_Uppercut> @Kivros My man with the Kung Pow reference, respect
[2:50:29] <%Irridium> she's AKCHEWALLY 1000 years old Kappa
[2:50:30] <%LordSDB> Didn't she lose all of that super young?
[2:50:31] <Halospaz117> I figure she was still in training when the Academy went kablooey
[2:50:33] <%alpacasintophats> I mean her school blew up
[2:50:34] <Augus7717> This is what happens when you dont kill the younglings @WoolieVersus
[2:50:35] <notenoughgirls> the answer to all of this is that she is restored cut content that was never refined because it was cut
[2:50:37] <%Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus my intepretation was that she was a kid when Dantooine was destroyed
[2:50:38] <%kapcommunist> god i have such a weakness for strawberry blondes
[2:50:38] <fuji_92> She was taugh wrong as a joke
[2:50:38] <dinnydanny777> Jedi literally kidnap kids and take them to an academy
[2:50:43] <+Zanco23> Her brain hasn't had much time to think.
[2:50:45] <derap41> Pretty sure she Blew her grades
[2:50:47] <dinnydanny777> The Jedi literally kidnap kids
[2:50:48] <+dezimaly> like 4 yeqars so she was 13 when it went bad
[2:50:49] <khotgor> The Jedi and Sith are the dumbest
[2:50:50] <$GabeSweetMan> They're SPACE HIPPIES
[2:50:50] <megamirk> Made Windu got cooked
[2:50:53] <%phatmac16> so this is why Anakin killed the younglings
[2:50:55] <%SomersaultJustice> is she that japanese soldier that didn't know the war was over?
[2:50:56] <olaksi> This motherfucking soup!
[2:50:59] <JetpackMcQuack> They meditate all day lol
[2:51:00] <dinnydanny777> They basically have no outside knowledge
[2:51:02] <DatAsuna> Mace windu got WIPED OUT
[2:51:03] <RrenKrieg> she didn't get to probably
[2:51:08] <DatAsuna> Ther'es some WIPEOUTS in this movie
[2:51:14] <$GabeSweetMan> LUL
[2:51:14] <%memequisition> jedi are true academics, very smart, good at science or philosophy. but can they do the laundry?
[2:51:14] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[2:51:16] <RrenKrieg> she was probably really young when the academy got wiped out
[2:51:17] <eliudfs1> Jedi training, at least in the Prequel era, are basically college graduates
[2:51:17] <YakumoYomi> Anakin was right all along. ANAKIN AND TOBIRAMA WERE RIGHT!
[2:51:19] <%BallerSwagBro9k> MACE COULD BBQ LIKE A BOSS
[2:51:22] <Redblood801> Mace Windu would just throw a raw steak on the table
[2:51:28] <+attackofthesage> She never finished her schooling. School blew up when she was younger
[2:51:41] <tuesti> it was removed for a reason man LUL
[2:51:42] <+griffball13> were did the holocron touch you
[2:51:44] <RrenKrieg> wait how is she stupid?
[2:51:48] <dinnydanny777> mai hoOme
[2:51:48] <RrenKrieg> that's very prejudiced
[2:51:51] <%Chatterbox1991> She was litterally a kid when dantooine was destroyed
[2:51:54] <$GabeSweetMan> Mace would join the Republic equivalent of the NBA.
[2:51:54] <%FallenAngelZelos> Time to rip off the band-aid
[2:51:56] <RunoEddie> Mission was 14, are there even a child model in these games? she might be intended to be a lot younger
[2:52:04] <+birtc> dotsHmmm dotsHmmm dotsHmmm
[2:52:07] <HorribleHog> Maybe she's a product of when force users are left alone -- their emotions go to the extremes unfocused and without meditation
[2:52:08] <%jiggy_snipe> if the voice acting was better, this might be bearable
[2:52:12] <andrei11dr> It was cut for a reason, that's for sure
[2:52:14] <zocano> The school blew up five years ago? Or was it 10? I forget
[2:52:14] <JetpackMcQuack> This is a true light side test
[2:52:15] <dinnydanny777> Is this girl being cyber bullied?
[2:52:17] <notenoughgirls> FORCEFUL
[2:52:20] <gandalfsmagicgaydick> Well, the whole thing with the Jedi during the prequels were that they were essentially forced into acting like soldiers. So they'd have military related skills in that era at least
[2:52:22] <dinnydanny777> Is this cyberbullying?
[2:52:25] <PunkZedB> salv a gers
[2:52:29] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @SnaKemuho
[2:52:29] <%jiggy_snipe> being cyber bullied LUL
[2:52:32] <+doc_ock_rokc> Salv en gers?
[2:52:34] <ALTRNico> you should probably kill her she might be influenced by the sith
[2:52:34] <Graywolf_the_45th> sal veggers
[2:52:36] <Joostebrood> god they do make the second option appealing
[2:52:45] <zocano> She’d be like 12 when the school blew up
[2:52:54] <Jonny_Uppercut> The Slav Rangers
[2:52:55] <eliudfs1> they were trained in diplomacy, and had lectures and stuff in the temple
[2:53:04] <asurite_warrior> Woolie should never start an orphanage.
[2:53:06] <eliudfs1> probably had a core curriculum
[2:53:11] <+Zanco23> MASTER SKY- bzzzt
[2:53:12] <Redblood801> Anakin killed the younglings because they mockingly called him Master
[2:53:12] <$legacy0117> Still wonder who is the most powerful Force user that isn't a Jedi, Grey, or Sith, they are probably really awesome.
[2:53:14] <$GabeSweetMan> YES

[2:56:51] <ZeeJiggle> Robot Planet sucks too 'cause like, it's a real interesting idea. It's just not worth it with the restored mod.
[2:57:01] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL what
[2:57:11] <ALTRNico> that sounds messed up
[2:57:20] <alrobot2014> @khotgor that's separate from the restored content mod so they're not doing it
[2:57:25] <ZeeJiggle> Omfg it is the Vulkar's lmao
[2:57:27] <RunoEddie> if the model they used for her looked younger and it was a better VO, it might've been fine

[3:00:18] <+MidnightBurst12> nah
[3:00:20] <ALTRNico> try 30
[3:00:21] <dinnydanny777> I thought it was 32
[3:00:23] <%jiggy_snipe> 25 is usuallly the age
[3:00:23] <T_Sasquatch> How can you hate children and be friends with PAT ? Kappa
[3:00:24] <%afronooch> I'd say 28 tbh
[3:00:24] <+SnapIntoaTimJim> You arent an Adult till you are 30 and can partake in the Senate.
[3:00:26] <%FallenAngelZelos> Children in fiction are usually awful because they are just a problem waiting to happen.

[3:01:00] <@Menitta> Sweet. I have THREE YEARS T OGO
[3:01:07] <andrei11dr> Im fine with that, being an adult doesn't seem as great as i thought it was when i was a child
[3:01:08] <%ChoculaUltra> I'm 29. I was supposed to be an adult but I must've missed the patch somewhere down the line.
[3:01:13] <Safarihat> voice acting is a learned skill
[3:01:15] <dinnydanny777> Feel the beat of the tambourine
[3:01:22] <HorribleHog> that content was probably left out because why wouldn't this character as a jedi take the padawan with them

[3:01:29] <+MagicBeanBurrito> D-Package
[3:01:29] <RunoEddie> voice acting is a skill

[3:01:32] <lotharrio> Toss that in as needed.
[3:01:36] <@Menitta> I'm at that point in life where I'm afraid of literally everything I do
[3:01:37] <dorpork> Kaeve is not restored content mod, it's a fan-mod that was forcibly inserted into this mod
[3:01:44] <megamirk> dex is still better
[3:01:46] <DatAsuna> just put it on before you do a check
[3:01:47] <@Menitta> "Will this have consequences? Probably....uhhhhh"
[3:01:51] <DatAsuna> don't keep it on
[3:01:53] <%Zohare> T3 will always be god
[3:01:54] <notenoughgirls> kaeve is restored content
[3:01:57] <%CursedNobleman> @Menitta that is what true power is LUL
[3:01:59] <%krispen_wa> wow fanny's stats are actually pretty low for this part of the game
[3:02:02] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @dorpork
[3:02:02] <+Zanco23> How old is the Exile? 38, right?
[3:02:06] <dinnydanny777> The best voice acting in any game is Dynasty Warriors 3
[3:02:14] <notenoughgirls> she even has a page on wookiepedia
[3:02:19] <$GabeSweetMan> @Menitta It helps when you realize that no matter your choice, it's the wrong one. Just try to make it less wrong.
[3:02:22] <%SirGO0SE> nice cock

[3:02:28] <HorribleHog> dorpork holy shit, really?
[3:02:28] <olaksi> @dorpork Really? Every modding project has to have the one guy who insist on adding weird shit I guess
[3:02:38] <derap41> I'd say 8.5/10
[3:02:42] <derap41> Good Job Kiddo
[3:02:50] <Joostebrood> Exile realistically is mid-30s or smth considering Mandalorian Wars were 10 years before
[3:02:50] <+DorianCreed> @WoolieVersus Give Mira the Carth Guns
[3:02:51] <DatAsuna> It's fuly upgradable, pretty decent
[3:02:52] <subjectg> kaeve is not fan content, but restored content that was voiced by a fan
[3:02:54] <notenoughgirls> Kaeve is restored content
[3:02:59] <dinnydanny777> Feeeeeeeeeeellll the pooooowwwwweeeerrrrr offffffff mmmmmmmmyyyyyy maaaaaaageeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek
[3:03:10] <%CursedNobleman> @dinnydanny777 A dike?! OH NO!
[3:03:13] <subjectg> try not to discredit the modders for tslrcm pls
[3:03:14] <%krispen_wa> Kaeve was a mistake
[3:03:23] <notenoughgirls> wookieepedia/wiki/Kaevee
[3:03:30] <DSD24> Kreia looking nice today
[3:03:36] <FusionFountain> Disruptor, I hardly know her
[3:03:42] <vulkan_vibes> Eh. Voice actors deserve respect
[3:03:54] <dinnydanny777> Can you even change Kreia's clothes?
[3:04:04] <DSD24> Nope
[3:04:04] <@Menitta> I have massive respect for mods that have new voice acting.
[3:04:04] <olaksi> Mostly voice actors deserve to be paid
[3:04:05] <andrei11dr> For being 80 ,Kreia is still banging
[3:04:05] <dinnydanny777> Is Kreia stuck to her clothes lol
[3:04:06] <%Zohare> Kreia's model doesn't change
[3:04:06] <%krispen_wa> She wasn't a voice actor though
[3:04:08] <dorpork> Like I said, Kaevee is not restored content mod. The only thing the modders had to go on was some notes in the files. She was scrapped early into development. No dialogue was ever written for her
[3:04:19] <@Menitta> Like the Ace Attorney Investigations 2 English fan translation
[3:04:23] <lotharrio> "Let me see your MANAGER!"
[3:04:25] <+funnyfunnykid> Whe would not like out "Doing The Right Thing, A Spike Lee Joint"
[3:04:25] <+DorianCreed> Master Bitching
[3:04:27] <ralphfromdk> Fus Rho Da?
[3:04:30] <dinnydanny777> Kreia was born in those robes and she'll die in those robes lol
[3:04:35] <+funnyfunnykid> i had a stroke there
[3:04:40] <RunoEddie> also... I'd wager a guess that she wasn't directed in any shape or form
[3:04:49] <dorpork> Thankfully there is a mod to remove Kaevee and restore Jorran, the Unofficial TSLRCM Tweak Pack
[3:04:49] <+Zanco23> Can you put Granny in the slave outfit?
[3:04:51] <olaksi> The o' battleax
[3:04:54] <+awkwardl0ser> Kaeve Richards is my favorite member of The Rolling Stones
[3:05:02] <RunoEddie> even if a voice actor is great, the direction matters A LOT
[3:05:05] <derap41> If only the game had a sledge hammer
[3:05:06] <DatAsuna> Kreia would rip and tear
[3:05:09] <DatAsuna> until it was done
[3:05:09] <%MrRabbles> Granny living her most metal life
[3:05:15] <dinnydanny777> Can Kreia use a wrist launcher?
[3:05:18] <notenoughgirls> who is usagi
[3:05:19] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1262613184097255426
[3:05:26] <DatAsuna> @Zanco23 all armours just change into her default robe
[3:05:27] <dinnydanny777> Can Kreia use fists?
[3:05:28] <subjectg> rip that goto interaction btw
[3:05:29] <andrei11dr> She's not a Jedi, so it makes sense that she doesn't have a light saber
[3:05:32] <%Gruhunchously> Usagi Kenshin
[3:05:34] <$DoktahDoktah> That literally sounds like Red Green.
[3:05:38] <DatAsuna> @Zanco23 probably so they never have to show her stump
[3:05:40] <+rakka90> Oh look, it's old Luke!
[3:05:47] <Redblood801> That's fair
[3:05:52] <$DoktahDoktah> Well just duct tape up that lightsaber.
[3:05:56] <DatAsuna> that's fair but screw him anyway
[3:06:04] <olaksi> LUL
[3:06:04] <dorpork> Kaevee makes no sense. The entire game is about rebuilding the jedi order, but she just fucks off? Like I said, it's not restored content, it's a fan-made mod.
[3:06:08] <%krispen_wa> Can I see it?
[3:06:09] <DatAsuna> you really don't need lightsabers
[3:06:09] <%krispen_wa> No
[3:06:11] <derap41> what
[3:06:17] <olaksi> How is this not a scam
[3:06:19] <Deadbulky> Your rich
[3:06:21] <lotharrio> It's not a lightsaber, I'm pretty sure.
[3:06:22] <derap41> The fuck kinda deal is that
[3:06:33] <DSD24> So many saves
[3:06:35] <%CursedNobleman> Why does Nihilus, the largest Sith, not simply eat the other Jedi?
[3:06:35] <%LordSDB> This is rng
[3:06:37] <DatAsuna> Also short saber is for dual wielding
[3:06:37] <%Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus Get GOTO back in the party for thsi
[3:06:40] <FusionFountain> @doktahdoktah Have you ever thought about duct taping 2 light sabers together?
[3:06:42] <dinnydanny777> Dagger lightsabers
[3:06:45] <+DorianCreed> Short Lightsaber is totally worth it, -2 damage for +2 to hit
[3:06:45] <%LordSDB> Thats why woolie is saving
[3:06:47] <RrenKrieg> short lightsabers are good actually
[3:06:49] <damienlunas> Short is for dual wielding
[3:06:53] <%LordSDB> i think
[3:06:56] <dinnydanny777> Stealth lightsabers
[3:06:59] <DatAsuna> @CursedNobleman Because kreia and visas overhyped him
[3:07:01] <subjectg> you can get goto to negotiate here
[3:07:08] <+rottingpastry> it's the hilt, not the blade length
[3:07:09] <%wunp_fxs> wow didnt know that
[3:07:12] <DSD24> Its the Miyamoto style
[3:07:15] <dinnydanny777> Lightsaber cheese knife
[3:07:20] <RrenKrieg> it's a lightsaber hilt that's fit for just one hand
[3:07:22] <DSD24> Big Sword and Small Sword
[3:07:24] <%wunp_fxs> why has knowbody made that an attack method?
[3:07:24] <Robot_Nixon_> why dont jedis just make a 20' long lightsaber?
[3:07:27] <dinnydanny777> What are those little katana's called
[3:07:31] <%jiggy_snipe> so I can a little knife?
[3:07:32] <dinnydanny777> Those thingy'
[3:07:33] <RrenKrieg> most lightsabers are long enough to be held with two hands
[3:07:33] <subjectg> wakizashi?
[3:07:34] <JackalKing> Luke Skywalker, in one of the novels for the old EU, could also change the width of his lightsaber to be as thin as a pencil
[3:07:37] <olaksi> Wouldn't a button the immediately makes extend 3 meters be super OP?
[3:07:37] <%CursedNobleman> overcompensating LUL
[3:07:38] <%ThePimpGuin> why would you limit your reach then? the blade has no weight!
[3:07:38] <mak0t0yukii> Big pp small pp
[3:07:40] <ZeeJiggle> Ah yes, the Lightsaber Cheese Knife
[3:07:47] <ghoulishcripple> short as in Hilt you big pps
[3:07:49] <FusionFountain> Because it’s a small hilt I’d assume
[3:07:50] <RrenKrieg> it's basically the size of the hilt
[3:07:56] <DSD24> We need the Peony Blade from No More Heroes 2
[3:07:59] <+glgzephyr> @Robot_Nixon_ one of the students in the Young Jedi Knights series built an extendable lightsaber. He fucked himself up with it.
[3:08:03] <notenoughgirls> a pencil width lightsaber sounds ridiculous
[3:08:04] <+MillerLowlife> tiny lightsabers make superb coffee stirrers/reheaters
[3:08:09] <%krispen_wa> and in Rebels, the visual directors also made every lightsaber as thin as a pencil
[3:08:15] <dinnydanny777> Just make a lightsaber Masamune
[3:08:19] <ghoulishcripple> i agree @dsd24
[3:08:22] <DatAsuna> It's because wakizahi
[3:08:25] <+griffball13> orange great color
[3:08:30] <Redblood801> Orange Gang Rise Up!
[3:08:31] <RrenKrieg> Longsaber mod was a good mod
[3:08:31] <Halospaz117> hehe you said knob
[3:08:34] <%xcompleasedad> Good parts?
[3:08:40] <derap41> Could be worse
[3:08:41] <Tucker0603> ORANGE BEST
[3:08:44] <Dangerzone979> a shorter lightsaber lends itself better to duel wielding?
[3:08:47] <$DoktahDoktah> This guy is loot boxes!
[3:08:48] <DatAsuna> I always give the exile orange
[3:08:53] <DSD24> Orange is the new black?
[3:08:54] <%TheFabledAble> LOL YOU DIDNT HAVE TO KILL THAT GUY ON NAR SHADA AFTER ALL XDDDDD
[3:08:57] <andrei11dr> There should be like a super huge light saber, that is like the size of a canon
[3:09:00] <$DoktahDoktah> Loot boxes in my KOTOR2?!
[3:09:01] <subjectg> @woolieversus you guys missed it, but there’s a great interaction with GOTO where you can get him to negotiate a lower price with Jorran via threat of law-mandated slavery
[3:09:03] <%TheFabledAble> YOU COULD HAVE JUST COME HERE
[3:09:05] <ghoulishcripple> Yeah short lightsaber has balanced so its better to dual wield
[3:09:08] <dinnydanny777> There should be a lightsaber cannon
[3:09:11] <notenoughgirls> smart laigreks
[3:09:14] <%jiggy_snipe> big Guts lightsaber
[3:09:14] <dinnydanny777> That shoots lightsabers
[3:09:20] <Joostebrood> Gawd Karen
[3:09:21] <DSD24> This lady still sucks Woolie
[3:09:22] <Robot_Nixon_> @glgzephyr LUL that sucks LUL
[3:09:26] <+glgzephyr> @dinnydanny777 There is. They talked about it last week
[3:09:27] <$DoktahDoktah> Bullets with tiny light sabers on the front of them.
[3:09:32] <ALTRNico> ok Karen
[3:09:38] <derap41> Gotta say that armor is great
[3:09:43] <+glgzephyr> @Robot_Nixon_ Yeah it blew up in his hands because surprise surprise it was unstable as fuck
[3:09:54] <ghoulishcripple> lightsaber bat with little needles of energy for spikes
[3:09:54] <andrei11dr> Dantooine is sure cool you guys LUL
[3:09:59] <dinnydanny777> There should be a lightsaber greatsword
[3:10:06] <%Zohare> Yes
[3:10:08] <ALTRNico> yes
[3:10:08] <endarren> Mandos near by
[3:10:08] <%OldManDeckardCain> Would Force Karen just teleport the user to the highest authority on the planet? LUL
[3:10:09] <DSD24> Nice bonfire nerd
[3:10:14] <%Irridium> you know what yeah sure
[3:10:15] <%Gruhunchously> Yes, they are actually in your inventory
[3:10:22] <%Zohare> You picked up the body
[3:10:23] <alrobot2014> @endarren they already talked to the mandos
[3:10:25] <%jiggy_snipe> your special force bag
[3:10:29] <%bread_assassin> Force Hammerspace
[3:10:32] <endarren> oh
[3:10:33] <RrenKrieg> force bag of holding
[3:10:35] <$legacy0117> And I destroyed her. Because she's a B*****tch....
[3:10:35] <subjectg> force bag of holding
[3:10:35] <%gatorafan> Corpse (Item)
[3:10:37] <endarren> I missed that
[3:10:39] <Robot_Nixon_> @glgzephyr were light saber spears ever a thing?
[3:10:41] <derap41> Jedi Force Mattercondesion
[3:10:43] <e3a4> You just cut off their face and put it in your bag
[3:10:44] <$Invlux> thanks
[3:10:44] <jnaynnay> You didn’t tell what she was really going to do with them
[3:10:46] <RrenKrieg> @Robot_Nixon_ yes
[3:10:46] <+sunriser101> shhh, dont worry about it
[3:10:46] <Dangerzone979> Shoved em' inside G0-T0
[3:10:47] <+doc_ock_rokc> EXCUSE ME PRINCESS
[3:10:49] <%Irridium> you say that like I don't think about it every day
[3:10:50] <DatAsuna> @endarren he got them last week
[3:10:51] <%Gruhunchously> EXCUSE ME PRINCESS
[3:10:52] <lotharrio> Well excuuuuse me, V/
[3:10:55] <%jiggy_snipe> we never forgot
[3:10:55] <RrenKrieg> saberstaff are a thing
[3:11:00] <+glgzephyr> @Robot_Nixon_ Unknown to me, but it wouldn't surprise me at all
[3:11:08] <Robot_Nixon_> Would lightsaber spears > swords work?
[3:11:08] <notenoughgirls> i love those flying manta rays on dantooine
[3:11:10] <andrei11dr> I mean Fantasy Star Online has the giant laser great swords if that counts
[3:11:11] <%ChoculaUltra> 80s Zelda Cartoon Link was an absolute Chad who had his eyes on one thing and one thing only. Getting laid.
[3:11:11] <derap41> Not the Rapey Goblins!
[3:11:12] <damienlunas> Mr. Compress?
[3:11:13] <AvailableThor> Mr Compress
[3:11:18] <%phatmac16> yeah
[3:11:18] <RrenKrieg> @Robot_Nixon_ yes
[3:11:22] <AvailableThor> There's also a guy from HxH
[3:11:22] <dinnydanny777> 80s Link is best Link
[3:11:29] <%phatmac16> a guy in HXH does that too
[3:11:31] <Robot_Nixon_> god I love spears
[3:11:33] <RrenKrieg> Lightspear > lightsabers yes
[3:11:36] <DSD24> Spears are rad
[3:11:37] <dinnydanny777> But then when did Link ever stop being a chas
[3:11:40] <%Gruhunchously> If you actually want light side points later, you should rat the leiutenant guy out to his boss
[3:11:42] <dinnydanny777> Chad*
[3:12:10] <Space_Pagan> Mical is a snitch!
[3:12:11] <DSD24> Whisper Whisper
[3:12:18] <gandalfsmagicgaydick> Fuckin' rat!
[3:12:23] <megamirk> Carth is totally chilling on that beach
[3:12:23] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:12:24] <DatAsuna> Carth has actual lines
[3:12:28] <datmouse> LOL
[3:12:29] <Space_Pagan> Snitches get stiches
[3:12:33] <DatAsuna> Owo
[3:12:34] <dinnydanny777> Carth is hanging with his son
[3:12:35] <lotharrio> Farmer guy has stuff for you, too.
[3:12:37] <benjehuda> *notices your lightsaber* owo
[3:12:42] <alrobot2014> *notices your lightsaber* -w-
[3:12:46] <khotgor> huh. Is that the female companion?
[3:12:48] <OverlordLuna> UwU
[3:12:53] <dinnydanny777> Carth is somewhere vibin with his son
[3:12:55] <Space_Pagan> yes
[3:12:56] <+glgzephyr> I dunno about lightspears being definitively better than lightsabers in context. Remember that we're expecting the people wielding these weapons to be Force users, which adds a ton of variables to what was previously a simple combat analysis
[3:13:02] <subjectg> that’s metagaming, woolie
[3:13:08] <DSD24> @khotgor The Disciple joins instead of Handmaiden if you are a lady
[3:13:14] <olaksi> The ECHO
[3:13:17] <%ChoculaUltra> no one ever talks about Lumiya and her wacky Lightwhip.
[3:13:18] <dinnydanny777> Ok guys hear me out here
[3:13:23] <dinnydanny777> Lightsaber bow
[3:13:23] <%ChoculaUltra> shit was wacky!
[3:13:26] <lotharrio> Narc to this guy!
[3:13:30] <derap41> @glgzephyr a lightspear would be really eazy to cut off
[3:13:34] <megamirk> this guy looks like he's troubled
[3:13:34] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[3:13:37] <dinnydanny777> Lightsaber hammer?
[3:13:37] <DatAsuna> @glgzephyr but then you get senya with her saber pike that can snap down to a standard saber hilt in an instant too
[3:13:40] <derap41> Go Space Yourself is such a good line
[3:13:44] <DSD24> @dinnydanny777 Lightsaber Arrows maybe?
[3:13:48] <%SirGO0SE> familiar voice
[3:13:54] <+glgzephyr> @DatAsuna See now that's what I'm fucking talking about
[3:13:57] <MarkUriah> Why is this guy's voice so unique
[3:14:00] <dinnydanny777> The Imperial Guards for Palpatine have staffs that block lightsabers right?
[3:14:02] <RrenKrieg> @derap41 beskar steel lightspear hilts my dude
[3:14:03] <derap41> @SirGO0SE Medic!
[3:14:05] <+glgzephyr> Bloodborne lightsabers
[3:14:08] <Redblood801> John's Happy!
[3:14:09] <%andrex2311> so many smokes damn
[3:14:12] <megamirk> this guy's lungs are firmly on the darkside
[3:14:14] <DatAsuna> I'd fuck that guy
[3:14:17] <%Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus Don't forget to talk to the farmer guy
[3:14:21] <Safarihat> need more blue
[3:14:22] <RrenKrieg> talk to suulru
[3:14:23] <%ChoculaUltra> omg trick lightsabers ala Bloodborne would be so stupid sick.
[3:14:27] <RrenKrieg> rat him out for more light
[3:14:27] <%SirGO0SE> @derap41 tf2?!
[3:14:28] <%SirGO0SE> wow
[3:14:30] <andrei11dr> @dinnydanny777 You don't need a bow when you have guns....
[3:14:31] <%Gruhunchously> Talk to Sulruu
[3:14:45] <gandalfsmagicgaydick> You're still gonna need to do some red to get HK points
[3:14:51] <AvailableThor> Is that Dr Chakvas?
[3:14:56] <DatAsuna> @ChoculaUltra that's why senya's one of the coolest swtor characters
[3:14:58] <dinnydanny777> Ah yes, I forgot about the lightsaber guns
[3:14:59] <lotharrio> Farmer guy
[3:15:01] <alrobot2014> think so @AvailableThor
[3:15:04] <ralphfromdk> ChoculaUltra There is kind of one in one of the Old Republic trailers, with the mom and daughter. Extendo grip :D
[3:15:09] <%Chatterbox1991> yes its Chawkwas
[3:15:10] <+glgzephyr> Like can I please have a Rakuyo lightsaber
[3:15:20] <megamirk> fuck Vrook
[3:15:21] <lotharrio> You got the farmer who started the thief quest.
[3:15:27] <Safarihat> @WoolieVersus talk to the farmer!
[3:15:30] <jnaynnay> Gongaga
[3:15:32] <%phatmac16> I AM ALL THE JEDI
[3:15:39] <%Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus Turn in the theif quest!
[3:15:43] <dinnydanny777> Isn't there that super busted material that just blocks lightsabers completely?
[3:15:46] <megamirk> me? Gongaga
[3:15:49] <olaksi> This cave has been hyped so long, it better be a goddamn good cave
[3:15:50] <heartlesshealer> oh hey, it's the houses again
[3:15:51] <dinnydanny777> Why not just make everything out of that
[3:16:00] <+glgzephyr> crystal caaaaaave
[3:16:02] <dinnydanny777> I forget what it's called
[3:16:05] <subjectg> cortosis rare baby
[3:16:06] <heartlesshealer> where the two families shot each other
[3:16:09] <%Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus You didn't turn in the Sulruu quest
[3:16:11] <DatAsuna> @dinnydanny777 Actually there's multiple, mandalorian beskar steel can stop them, as does cortosis
[3:16:16] <alrobot2014> @olaksi this is a different cave
[3:16:24] <notenoughgirls> the lightsaber resistant metals are rare i believe
[3:16:26] <%optimasmaximas> @woolieversus they gave fujin vergil’s hair and max says a marvel reference
[3:16:27] <andrei11dr> I wonder why doesn't anyone in this universe put on anti laser clothes like Gundam Crossbone
[3:16:31] <Robot_Nixon_> @dinnydanny777 the chad stormtrooper that fought Finn comes to mind
[3:16:34] <dinnydanny777> Cortosis is super rare but still is the plot of like 10 different Empire plans to kill Jedi I think
[3:16:39] <%LordSDB> KILL
[3:16:40] <subjectg> @gruhunchously not something to hound them about rn, that goto interaction, however....
[3:16:48] <+glgzephyr> @olaksi This cave is hype for what you acquire in it. The cave they were hyping up before is elsewhere
[3:16:49] <olaksi> @alrobot2014 The cave really went downhill when it got a sequel
[3:16:50] <RrenKrieg> a jedi would probably be able to get those materials for a lightsaber hilt
[3:16:51] <notenoughgirls> actually isnt there a thing where the seperatists try making battle droids out of cortosis
[3:17:03] <Redblood801> There they go!
[3:17:07] <DatAsuna> lmao
[3:17:10] <DatAsuna> talk fast
[3:17:13] <%FallenAngelZelos> Don't worry boss. We got this!
[3:17:18] <tuesti> ive never seen that happen omg

[3:17:45] <ShiningAxis> only bao dur is fighting
[3:17:46] <lotharrio> Stank glands
[3:17:46] <derap41> He is covered in piss
[3:17:48] <Redblood801> Kinrath shit
[3:17:50] <+glgzephyr> this is amazing
[3:17:52] <+lag2993> good old fart gland
[3:17:54] <derap41> that's why he's so shiny
[3:17:54] <+glgzephyr> only bao is aggro
[3:17:57] <%MrRabbles> meanwhile they die in the background
[3:17:57] <dorpork> RECTUM
[3:18:00] <%gatorafan> Angry Granny voices in the background
[3:18:01] <+glgzephyr> kinrath are passive rn
[3:18:02] <heartlesshealer> SHE WOULD
[3:18:07] <+DorianCreed> Bao-Dur there just RIPPING AND TEARING

[3:18:33] <%phatmac16> BETRYAL
[3:18:35] <andrei11dr> Hmmm, that's quite sexual
[3:18:35] <megamirk> I want to hold your gland LUL
[3:18:37] <subjectg> I wanna hold your gland~
[3:18:38] <$Invlux> Kreygasm
[3:18:43] <OverlordLuna> Kreygasm
[3:18:45] <heartlesshealer> She loads up a whole shame room, she would absolutely turn from battle, saber in hand to "how dare you"
[3:18:46] <%phatmac16> THE TOHNO GLAND
[3:18:49] <DatAsuna> Well I kow what to ttile this episode. lol
[3:18:52] <Robot_Nixon_> WutFace
[3:18:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[3:18:55] <derap41> eh that's what she said?
[3:18:57] <lotharrio> I thought there was a, "Give what back?"
[3:19:02] <dinnydanny777> Just Visceral attack the Kinrath from behind
[3:19:06] <damienlunas> Actual Light Later answer
[3:19:08] <+RJay80> gland holding doodLewd
[3:19:09] <+glgzephyr> it's the asshole sarcastic option
[3:19:22] <Dangerzone979> What kind of gland takes several hours to remove?
[3:19:23] <DSD24> Let me see that shit
[3:19:23] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:19:23] <subjectg> My personal favorite of Kotor 2: the musical is “total eclipse of katarr”
[3:19:29] <%FallenAngelZelos> I'll give it back...PSYCHE!!!
[3:19:53] <%ThePimpGuin> by returning it you weaken him, granny wont like that
[3:20:02] <+glgzephyr> why the fuck do mercenaries even live here
[3:20:07] <+glgzephyr> WHO THE FUCK is hiring them
[3:20:11] <DatAsuna> @subjectg das a good one
[3:20:14] <dinnydanny777> This planet seems like it sucks
[3:20:17] <+glgzephyr> there are no jobs here
[3:20:18] <DatAsuna> with her teeth
[3:20:25] <dinnydanny777> Are there even houses on this planet
[3:20:29] <+glgzephyr> NO
[3:20:29] <lotharrio> He's a smartboi so he does good.
[3:20:35] <+glgzephyr> NOT ANYMORE
[3:20:42] <DatAsuna> TRAIN HIM TOO
[3:20:44] <Redblood801> Kriea over there ready to default dance on the Kinrath corpses
[3:20:49] <heartlesshealer> probably information jobs
[3:20:55] <Deadbulky> BE HONEST
[3:20:59] <blackskulldragon18> Train him
[3:21:07] <%Gruhunchously> Hey, the Order needs numbers
[3:21:10] <HorribleHog> except that padawan you just sent away
[3:21:16] <dinnydanny777> You've built a Jedi factory
[3:21:16] <DSD24> The Jedi STAND Arrow
[3:21:22] <DatAsuna> a fanny pack full of lightsabers
[3:21:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LIGHTSABER TSHIRT GUN
[3:21:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[3:21:31] <heartlesshealer> Yeah, the two houses on this planet were eliminated in Pockets canon
[3:21:40] <dinnydanny777> You've built a Jedi manufacturing line
[3:21:54] <+MagicBeanBurrito> One jedi turninto into a thousand
[3:21:55] <+ntfth> What happens if you told him? I never realized you could get that prompt.
[3:21:59] <RrenKrieg> express jedi oninle classes
[3:21:59] <vulkan_vibes> my head canon is that this guy eventually gets t tr gained by a new order
[3:22:05] <RrenKrieg> online*
[3:22:06] <Redblood801> I can make you a Jedi for $20
[3:22:08] <Deadbulky> She tates the mindbreak tag
[3:22:14] <Redblood801> Who wants in?
[3:22:19] <dinnydanny777> Woolie is building the Jedi Knight 3 Jedi Academy
[3:22:26] <+lag2993> simple cause you got to get good
[3:22:28] <+glgzephyr> so is granny gonna be rocking the battleaxe all the way through?
[3:22:33] <+glgzephyr> we do have other lightsabers
[3:22:38] <heartlesshealer> Jedi 101: DRAIN LIFE
[3:22:39] <lotharrio> She wants you to prove you don't NEED the Force to dominate the minds of others.
[3:22:46] <+glgzephyr> not that I'm not fine with the axe, it's hilarious
[3:22:48] <+lag2993> granny is just dark souls twitch chat
[3:23:04] <Redblood801> Can't you just leave the order by leaving?
[3:23:26] <DSD24> Oh man Morrowind is a good game
[3:23:29] <dorpork> insanity/horror is better because it targets their will throw, and most enemies have lower will stats than other stats, meaning its easier to land
[3:23:30] <+glgzephyr> death field just makes me remember the Hssiss Dragon EXP exploit
[3:23:38] <heartlesshealer> Morrowind had a fun system
[3:23:46] <DatAsuna> death field was basically in the ep9 duel of the fates script
[3:23:47] <DSD24> Fuck the Cliff Racers
[3:23:51] <$legacy0117> Did you literally arm Grannh with an Axe? x3
[3:23:51] <%Gruhunchously> They patched that out in the Restored Content
[3:23:58] <+glgzephyr> I crashed my xbox so many times getting that exp
[3:23:59] <$legacy0117> Granny*
[3:24:07] <megamirk> Dantooine lost its polish in between games
[3:24:08] <vulkan_vibes> correct. back in my day level cheesing was accomplished with evil stumpy dragons
[3:24:11] <%Gruhunchously> Hey, the Kinrath tunnelers
[3:24:21] <%Gruhunchously> BETRAYAL
[3:24:22] <heartlesshealer> Betrayal Scream would be the best mod
[3:24:25] <RrenKrieg> i could
[3:24:25] <$legacy0117> I approve.
[3:24:29] <%gatorafan> Force Elmo
[3:24:32] <heartlesshealer> aside from restored content
[3:24:34] <%Gruhunchously> Thanks John
[3:24:36] <%MrRabbles> i hope there is a clip of her yelling betrayal
[3:24:37] <subjectg> @dorpork kinda why kotor 1 had better encounter design, a lot of enemies had mind-affecting immunity to counteract it
[3:24:38] <vulkan_vibes> the effect lol
[3:24:40] <Daxalog> I like how you can hear a stock death scream in the force shout ability
[3:24:47] <+glgzephyr> best pathing was straight to this crystal, then straight to Korriban for the EXP glitch
[3:24:54] <dinnydanny777> Didn't Pockets kill the crystals
[3:25:05] <endarren> I think this is a place where you can farm XP infinitely.
[3:25:08] <Shade075> Revan charged those JO crystals
[3:25:12] <DatAsuna> @dinnydanny777 pockets killed kinrath eggs
[3:25:13] <heartlesshealer> maybe replace the stock death scream the force shout accesses with Betrayal.wav?
[3:25:14] <lotharrio> @dinnydanny777 Different cave
[3:25:19] <heartlesshealer> not a link, twitch
[3:25:21] <dinnydanny777> Oh yeah I forgot
[3:25:22] <%ThePimpGuin> Revan was Gold Roger all along
[3:25:24] <subjectg> that’s another planet entirely, alas
[3:25:29] <heartlesshealer> No one click that
[3:25:37] <notenoughgirls> JO kyber crystals
[3:25:48] <+glgzephyr> @dinnydanny777 Also she didn't kill the crystals, she killed the kinrath eggs which had red crystals inside for some reason
[3:25:52] <dinnydanny777> The force is crawling in my skin
[3:25:56] <ralphfromdk> Soooo.... Solar Panels crystals?
[3:25:58] <%Irridium> they're shaving the cents from your force dollars
[3:26:02] <%Gruhunchously> Ossus
[3:26:04] <DatAsuna> Ossus is lost
[3:26:06] <RrenKrieg> probably trained in coruscant
[3:26:10] <dinnydanny777> I thought the Crystal's needed blood or something
[3:26:15] <subjectg> ossus got blown up already
[3:26:20] <DatAsuna> The star went supernova and Ossus hasn't been inhabitable since exar kun
[3:26:25] <DSD24> Oh nooo
[3:26:26] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[3:26:38] <endarren> These guys will spawn endlessly.
[3:26:42] <OverlordLuna> Kreygasm
[3:26:43] <$Invlux> He's in the crystal room, get em boys
[3:26:44] <DatAsuna> Ossus didn't blow up
[3:26:46] <dinnydanny777> The Kinrath did nothing wrong
[3:26:49] <StarlitStunner> Ood Bnar is a good tree Jedi boy
[3:26:50] <DatAsuna> It just got super fucked up
[3:26:50] <+glgzephyr> NO PICKUPS HE SAYS
[3:27:04] <DatAsuna> Swtor has ossus and ood bnar in it, and luke moves his academy there too
[3:27:05] <+glgzephyr> no useful loot here
[3:27:07] <+glgzephyr> none at all
[3:27:13] <dinnydanny777> Very heroic use of force lightning
[3:27:26] <RrenKrieg> remains
[3:27:43] <DatAsuna> But what if it was violet?
[3:27:55] <+doc_ock_rokc> Old EU is that they are synthetic
[3:28:03] <lotharrio> Cause Kinrath eat crystals or something. It's fine.
[3:28:07] <RrenKrieg> awww unlucky
[3:28:09] <+glgzephyr> oh wait it's the BEST ITEM IN THE GAME
[3:28:09] <RrenKrieg> 2 kasha
[3:28:20] <heartlesshealer> yeah, the kinrath eat crystals I think
[3:28:24] <+glgzephyr> NO SELLS IT
[3:28:24] <DSD24> Fann Y'Pak crystal!
[3:28:25] <DatAsuna> Remember when obi-wan and qui-gon ued force speed ONCE in the movies
[3:28:26] <Redblood801> BAH
[3:28:28] <DatAsuna> and never again
[3:28:28] <+doc_ock_rokc> 2
[3:28:29] <abelincoln_catpuncher> the crystal!
[3:28:29] <ralphfromdk> The wand chooses the wizard!! :o
[3:28:34] <heartlesshealer> don't know how the egg babies get them though
[3:28:36] <notenoughgirls> the eggs dont give dark side points
[3:28:40] <abelincoln_catpuncher> put googly eyes on it
[3:28:40] <+MagicBeanBurrito> 2
[3:28:42] <StarlitStunner> Vollice worms and Klorr slugs literally shit saber crystals in SWTOR
[3:28:48] <RrenKrieg> anakin and obiwan use it too
[3:28:54] <derap41> I never liked this part of Kotor
[3:29:03] <blackskulldragon18> Endgame potential
[3:29:04] <+griffball13> the stonger you get the better your lightsaber is great
[3:29:06] <%kapcommunist> these crystals are making me thirsty
[3:29:06] <+doc_ock_rokc> 1?
[3:29:10] <RrenKrieg> when they ran away from the droids on the diplomatic mission to naboo
[3:29:22] <DSD24> I thought that said salve
[3:29:23] <derap41> This is almost as bad as midichlorians
[3:29:24] <DSD24> slave
[3:29:30] <JetpackMcQuack> str go up
[3:29:44] <alrobot2014> oh no
[3:29:47] <+doc_ock_rokc> PIRATES OF THE DARK WATER
[3:29:47] <+glgzephyr> Do you want it?
[3:29:48] <+DorianCreed> Raw Light Side Water
[3:29:48] <%MrRabbles> what about light later water
[3:29:49] <RrenKrieg> coke and sprite
[3:29:50] <DSD24> Jedi Dark Water
[3:29:52] <Kivros> sith bathwater
[3:29:52] <akman14> Stonks go up
[3:29:53] <+MillerLowlife> New EvilWater
[3:29:53] <derap41> MLM Jedi Water
[3:29:53] <Halospaz117> "I-Is it powered by my piss?"
[3:29:54] <abelincoln_catpuncher> light side infused water, $6 a pop
[3:29:56] <DatAsuna> the crystal runs on your pee
[3:29:59] <Daxalog> Would you drink dark water?
[3:30:00] <+MagicBeanBurrito> grey water
[3:30:01] <Graywolf_the_45th> lemme drink your force juice
[3:30:07] <+lag2993> oh no star wars has segregated force water fountains
[3:30:11] <+glgzephyr> no you need to realign it whenever you level up
[3:30:13] <dinnydanny777> hahaha
[3:30:14] <lotharrio> It also levels up to you via Kreia.
[3:30:16] <heartlesshealer> It's just that it's able to
[3:30:18] <+glgzephyr> no
[3:30:19] <abelincoln_catpuncher> was that what Luke was drinking in TLJ?
[3:30:22] <StarlitStunner> Force squeezins
[3:30:24] <suitangi021> And from leveling I think
[3:30:24] <+glgzephyr> it scales with level, not alignment
[3:30:34] <subjectg> it’s power is based on level, but alignment determines the buffs you get
[3:30:34] <gastherobots> Here's the problem, unless I'm mistaken force heal has always been a gameplay thing. Just an ability. This is where you need to separate gameplay from story. For instance, Arthur Morgan doesn't kill like 1000 people canonically in Red Dead. That would be ridiculous. Just like how characters don't LITERALLY have HP that had to be refilled canonically.
[3:30:38] <%Gruhunchously> IF your alignment changes, you can't use you lightsaber anymore
[3:30:40] <derap41> its both
[3:30:40] <dinnydanny777> The Jedi basically believe in magical crystal healing
[3:30:47] <%Gruhunchously> Until Kreia alters it for you
[3:30:48] <dinnydanny777> The Jedi believe in crystal healunf
[3:30:50] <+glgzephyr> @WoolieVersus It scales with level
[3:30:54] <dinnydanny777> healing*
[3:30:54] <lotharrio> @WoolieVersus It also levels up with you, but you gotta keep adjusting it via Kreia.
[3:31:06] <heartlesshealer> Firekeeper Kreia
[3:31:09] <%rosemon5001> use the crystal as a shiv @WoolieVersus
[3:31:10] <RrenKrieg> light-katars
[3:31:12] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @woolieversus put the crystal in your glove like a materia
[3:31:21] <DatAsuna> And level
[3:31:24] <Imsoverylazy> Woolie getting that Unlimited Powah
[3:31:29] <Joostebrood> the crystal is also ludicrously op - which is overkill in an already immensely easy lategame
[3:31:30] <tuesti> what would happen if there was actually a weapon made to hold the crystal? lightsaber gloves or some shit
[3:31:35] <%Gruhunchously> Baby bad-gloves
[3:31:40] <RunoEddie> baddy no-shoes?
[3:31:41] <dinnydanny777> Make a huge hilt and put 3 crystals in and make a greatsword
[3:31:42] <+glgzephyr> @WoolieVersus it scales with your level, not your alignment. Alignment determines which buffs it gives
[3:31:43] <DSD24> Lightsaber Throw!
[3:31:44] <%SirGO0SE> baddy naughty mittins
[3:32:05] <%SirGO0SE> or baddy three mittins?
[3:32:13] <+glgzephyr> Specifically, it scales from the level you acquire it at. So if you pick up the crystal very early, it becomes ludicrous quickly
[3:32:21] <RrenKrieg> @dinnydanny777 three crystals side to side, dont do what kylo ren did
[3:32:24] <DatAsuna> I would say it scales with both since pure light crystals is purelly additive to mosly light crystal
[3:32:24] <dinnydanny777> The crystal is actually incredibly brittle the actual saber is a projection or something
[3:32:47] <dinnydanny777> The crystal is just used to make the beam basically
[3:33:00] <solasknight> I don't actually remember slashing the eggs in Kotor 1 giving you Dark Side points
[3:33:04] <RrenKrieg> in legends it was more complex
[3:33:07] <+glgzephyr> he actually did it
[3:33:16] <%rosemon5001> immune to booms lol
[3:33:23] <tuesti> wow
[3:33:27] <heartlesshealer> lock egg with mine
[3:33:27] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:33:28] <%FallenAngelZelos> 14 months
[3:33:35] <Redblood801> Class C bug
[3:33:48] <heartlesshealer> egg persist
[3:33:58] <+glgzephyr> damned crystal
[3:33:59] <dinnydanny777> So Kinrath are dakside creatures?
[3:34:05] <+glgzephyr> nah
[3:34:06] <DatAsuna> not even class c
[3:34:14] <+glgzephyr> they're just spideres
[3:34:17] <+glgzephyr> spiders*
[3:34:20] <dinnydanny777> Because it kind of seems like you invaded their cave slaughtered them all and stole their crystals
[3:34:28] <dinnydanny777> Like a big hero
[3:34:31] <heartlesshealer> no, the darkside points are for killing baby creatures still in their eggs
[3:34:34] <lotharrio> It's named after you.
[3:34:38] <subjectg> they’re just animals, don’t worry
[3:34:41] <+glgzephyr> not their crystals. Just happens to be the cave they live in
[3:34:46] <gastherobots> I remember RPing an Exile who was super wary of redoing the whole Jedi thing. Rocked a vibroblade up until the last planet.
[3:34:49] <lotharrio> Devil Sword Fann Y'Pak
[3:34:53] <solasknight> I mean does a Jedi get Dark Side points for having eggs for breakfast?
[3:34:56] <dinnydanny777> Killing animals is A-OKAY - say the Jedi
[3:35:00] <megamirk> how hard will they fuck up the KOTOR movies?
[3:35:06] <olaksi> Force regulations changed
[3:35:17] <+SolidusRex> Woolie, you didn't get any darkside points for the eggs in KotOR 1, just red crystals
[3:35:18] <DatAsuna> That assumes they would even make the movies
[3:35:21] <heartlesshealer> well, consumption provides purpose to the egg destruction. Bashing destroys to destroy
[3:35:25] <Joostebrood> galaxy's progressed, kinnrath eggs became evil since 4 years ago
[3:35:27] <+glgzephyr> there will be no KOTOR movies
[3:35:31] <megamirk> @DatAsuna they're making the movies now, aren't they?
[3:35:31] <FusionFountain> Masochist?
[3:35:32] <%kapcommunist> omg youre so obsessed with me john!
[3:35:34] <+MillerLowlife> force got patched
[3:35:38] <%Gruhunchously> John is butthurt about all the crime we did on Telos
[3:35:40] <DatAsuna> why do you think that?
[3:35:48] <+glgzephyr> @megamirk you're thinking of the High Republic
[3:35:54] <tuesti> LEAVE HIM
[3:35:56] <%Gruhunchously> Vrook
[3:35:57] <Redblood801> It's that fuck
[3:35:58] <ShinobiPhoenix> I went to Dantooine first and the cave was a pain in the ass for me, I can't believe Woolie is just going through it like butter now
[3:35:59] <DatAsuna> also the high republic is only books
[3:36:02] <Halospaz117> Master Crotchety Fuck
[3:36:02] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> What a bitch.
[3:36:03] <Space_Pagan> WEAK
[3:36:04] <+griffball13> hey there master bitch
[3:36:04] <+glgzephyr> oh really
[3:36:05] <megamirk> @glgzephyr oh, all right, my bad
[3:36:08] <gandalfsmagicgaydick> Remeber to swap in HK before you leave the cage
[3:36:12] <+glgzephyr> nevermind I'm wrong
[3:36:14] <Halospaz117> Isn't that Bastila's Mom's face?
[3:36:14] <olaksi> LUL
[3:36:16] <DSD24> You didn't hear the lightning?
[3:36:31] <+MagicBeanBurrito> "I have a lightsaber"
[3:36:35] <dorpork> damn Bastila's mom must have fallen on hard times
[3:36:38] <megamirk> zaps
[3:36:38] <PunkZedB> "This isn't kidnapping, it's our job!"
[3:36:38] <%Irridium> GOTO has some fun dialog here
[3:36:39] <olaksi> bzz
[3:36:40] <notenoughgirls> goto is LITERALLY here
[3:36:42] <%ThePimpGuin> what happens if G0T0 is with you for this?
[3:36:43] <%Gruhunchously> 2
[3:36:44] <Redblood801> Ignite
[3:36:44] <DSD24> All of these people are idiots
[3:36:49] <akman14> That VA sounds familiar
[3:36:50] <heartlesshealer> Defend yourself then is a fun answer
[3:36:52] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> 2077 gun button
[3:36:56] <+MagicBeanBurrito> HAHAHA
[3:36:57] <$legacy0117> DEW IT
[3:36:59] <+glgzephyr> also it wouldn't work
[3:37:03] <%andrex2311> lion king! nice!
[3:37:04] <%LordSDB> WAIT WHY THO
[3:37:05] <Deadbulky> Dont mindbreak
[3:37:08] <%jiggy_snipe> stop using the force D:<
[3:37:09] <Space_Pagan> Granny mad
[3:37:14] <+MagicBeanBurrito> 4
[3:37:17] <blackskulldragon18> Good guy talk
[3:37:17] <%LordSDB> You do it all the time GRANNY!
[3:37:21] <%jiggy_snipe> awesome
[3:37:22] <%FallenAngelZelos> So edgy
[3:37:22] <DSD24> Mindbreak is the worst tag
[3:37:24] <DatAsuna> stop resisiting
[3:37:24] <dorpork> picking 1 is fine you have more than enough influence with kreia
[3:37:29] <$legacy0117> Force Persuade or MURDER THEM ALL
[3:37:30] <blackskulldragon18> ZAP TIME
[3:37:39] <abelincoln_catpuncher> Wasn't that voice actress from the 1st game?
[3:37:39] <+glgzephyr> are we really not using storm here
[3:37:41] <DatAsuna> you did have other dialogue options lol
[3:37:42] <$legacy0117> Literally the choices.
[3:37:43] <notenoughgirls> does that woman have bastila's mom's face?
[3:37:54] <heartlesshealer> slaps
[3:37:57] <gastherobots> This is the one instance where regular dudes being cocky against a Jedi actually makes sense considering they already captured one.
[3:38:02] <DSD24> @notenoughgirls Twin Sister
[3:38:03] <$legacy0117> And Granny says no to Force Persuade.
[3:38:06] <DatAsuna> that point is a dark side one tho
[3:38:07] <%GraceTBM> yeah that's bastilas moms face
[3:38:09] <Space_Pagan> HK! Yes!
[3:38:10] <lotharrio> Hate Vrook, so much.
[3:38:11] <$legacy0117> HHMMM.
[3:38:12] <tuesti> leave vrook to die
[3:38:15] <dorpork> 3
[3:38:19] <Space_Pagan> HOES MAD
[3:38:23] <dorpork> pick 3
[3:38:23] <Redblood801> What a fuck
[3:38:26] <blackskulldragon18> Your Welcome BUDDY
[3:38:26] <%jiggy_snipe> this guy is that type of old guy
[3:38:34] <+evbites> Kill Him
[3:38:40] <DatAsuna> I like whatever that noise was
[3:38:42] <+glgzephyr> but we just have to kill the bad guys
[3:38:43] <%Chatterbox1991> ED
[3:38:47] <KnivesEve> no they dont ED
[3:38:48] <Tomas2886Cz> what a crusty bastard
[3:38:51] <Redblood801> Vrook isn't a clown, he's the entire circus.
[3:38:52] <notenoughgirls> vrook is the definition of jedi arrogance
[3:38:52] <+glgzephyr> stop blaming me for your inability to kill the bad guys
[3:38:52] <megamirk> Kreia and Vrook doing a fusion-ha
[3:38:55] <megamirk> imagine
[3:38:57] <%jiggy_snipe> the voice actor sounds familiar
[3:39:03] <%Gruhunchously> Ed Asner
[3:39:04] <notenoughgirls> kreia in the bg
[3:39:10] <%Irridium> it's Ed Asner
[3:39:11] <tuesti> just body him
[3:39:11] <DSD24> 2 is amazing
[3:39:14] <$legacy0117> Yeah I never met this guy, H sounds like dirt.
[3:39:15] <heartlesshealer> shut him the fuck down
[3:39:17] <prince_johnny_> LUL
[3:39:18] <Space_Pagan> BUUUURN
[3:39:19] <%jiggy_snipe> ah thx
[3:39:21] <$legacy0117> He*
[3:39:23] <+glgzephyr> this isn't dark side bro
[3:39:24] <blackskulldragon18> Bruh
[3:39:25] <Space_Pagan> Dew it!
[3:39:30] <SnaKemuho> MENTAL PARRIES
[3:39:33] <%JohnAtDawn> YES
[3:39:36] <$legacy0117> I we are above dirt.
[3:39:38] <%ThePimpGuin> They Boiled a whole planets people
[3:39:44] <$legacy0117> We*
[3:39:48] <megamirk> why didn't you go DARK SIDE?!
[3:39:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> COMBO BREAKER
[3:39:51] <lotharrio> Mandolorians lining people up and marching them into a boiling sea. "Let's see how this turns out."
[3:40:01] <DatAsuna> Mando'a
[3:40:03] <Joostebrood> How many times have we relitigated the Mandalorian Wars now.
[3:40:06] <+glgzephyr> 2
[3:40:10] <%JohnAtDawn> Oh that 4 is a big button
[3:40:16] <RrenKrieg> speaking mando'a would be sick tho
[3:40:22] <Sapphire_Breeze> what a bitch
[3:40:29] <DSD24> I love maybes
[3:40:29] <derap41> Inaction is action
[3:40:29] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1262613184097255426
[3:40:30] <megamirk> dude's wrong and refuses to admit it
[3:40:30] <RrenKrieg> it's literal and to the point
[3:40:31] <megamirk> what a guy
[3:40:35] <+evbites> what is mando speak
[3:40:37] <RrenKrieg> i like mando'a
[3:40:37] <+glgzephyr> knowing, sure, but I'm 99.9% certain a lot more people would be dead
[3:40:39] <Redblood801> Vrook is almost as bad as Atris
[3:40:41] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> I'm pretty sure it doesn't take special powers to see what the Mandos were going to do.
[3:40:41] <Space_Pagan> What a jedi!
[3:40:45] <heartlesshealer> now kill him
[3:40:46] <olaksi> It's almost like an inaction is a decision with consequences too
[3:40:53] <%ThePimpGuin> yet he didn't tell you to leave before you started fighting here...
[3:40:53] <Space_Pagan> Atris is still worse
[3:40:56] <+glgzephyr> Vrook is the essence of what is wrong with the Jedi
[3:40:58] <RrenKrieg> @evbites go read about it, mando'a is awesome
[3:41:07] <%gatorafan> Force whataboutism
[3:41:07] <+evbites> k
[3:41:07] <+rottingpastry> YOU DIDN'T WIN
[3:41:10] <megamirk> fuck em
[3:41:11] <RrenKrieg> although most of it is legends now
[3:41:11] <lotharrio> Vrook is such a piece of shit.
[3:41:12] <gastherobots> It's like a parent who is 100% wrong not listening to their child because "I'M THE ADULT"
[3:41:16] <%wunp_fxs> Vrook is the worst
[3:41:21] <notenoughgirls> the part in rebels where sabine actually speaks mandalorian was neat
[3:41:21] <megamirk> didn't notice Kreia, what a retard
[3:41:34] <+lag2993> are politicians the true jedi
[3:41:36] <+glgzephyr> mandalore!
[3:41:38] <DSD24> @gastherobots Or "Because I said so"
[3:41:40] <gandalfsmagicgaydick> The problem is... Revan jumping to battle is exactly what certain people wanted. He played into their hands hard
[3:41:46] <%ThePimpGuin> goto
[3:41:54] <RrenKrieg> manda and hk
[3:41:58] <derap41> Neutral...somehow
[3:42:02] <andrei11dr> He's such a bitch, he's a Jedi and he got imprisoned by some jobbers
[3:42:10] <+glgzephyr> kreia loves this next bit
[3:42:15] <megamirk> a jedi master*
[3:42:16] <Sapphire_Breeze> DELAYED GOOD
[3:42:16] <KnivesEve> woah wait hk is neutral?
[3:42:19] <megamirk> that makes him more of a jobber
[3:42:23] <%Irridium> more than neutral
[3:42:24] <notenoughgirls> BLUE
[3:42:25] <DSD24> I like Blue HK
[3:42:27] <Joostebrood> HK is straight up blueish now
[3:42:28] <DatAsuna> You could have gotten +2INF from that merc convo too
[3:42:31] <%FallenAngelZelos> @KnivesEve Mistakes were made.
[3:42:31] <%Chatterbox1991> MIRA
[3:42:40] <%xcompleasedad> Holy fuck
[3:42:41] <xiccy> BLUE HK.....
[3:42:41] <%jiggy_snipe> light side HK murders for good
[3:42:42] <DSD24> Blue Bois!
[3:42:42] <gandalfsmagicgaydick> @andrei11dr If you play out the convo a different way he did it on purpose to try to draw the mercs off planet
[3:42:43] <%Gruhunchously> Blue HK
[3:42:45] <PunkZedB> this is the power of light later
[3:42:45] <$Invlux> I find it suspicious that even with the influence buff Kreia is STILL grey
[3:42:47] <%Ghostbody> Light later?
[3:42:48] <DSD24> We like making noise
[3:42:50] <heartlesshealer> there's always rifle stuff
[3:42:57] <Joostebrood> you really should pick up that HK upgrade on Nar Shaddaa
[3:42:58] <%Malik1002> @woolieversus WAIT WHAT ABOUT THE ALIGNMENT SYSTEM WOULDN'T THIS TURN HK MORE BLUE?
[3:42:58] <notenoughgirls> kreia's alignment is fixed
[3:43:02] <+evbites> "We don't have a word for hero but we have one for coward" - Mandolorian wiki
[3:43:09] <+evbites> thats good
[3:43:10] <%MrRabbles> Blue HK is just dark side later HK
[3:43:14] <DSD24> OOOF
[3:43:21] <DSD24> That doesn't look right
[3:43:22] <alrobot2014> fann's juices just keep flowing out
[3:43:25] <subjectg> @joostebrood they might be able to do it once they’re done on this planet
[3:43:25] <grandark_z317> isn't this what they wanted?
[3:43:28] <%FallenAngelZelos> He doesn't look like a cool guy anymore thooo!
[3:43:29] <derap41> Lightside later
[3:43:35] <%ChoculaUltra> the road to hell is paved with lightside intentions.
[3:43:38] <andrei11dr> Time for some Light Later
[3:43:44] <+DorianCreed> @WoolieVersus Don't think of them as Light Side, think of them as Dark Side Later
[3:43:50] <DatAsuna> you already missed easy influence for visas and goto
[3:43:53] <derap41> It is pretty damn evil
[3:43:54] <megamirk> battle boner
[3:43:55] <dereks0n> No it's very evil
[3:43:57] <+glgzephyr> yes scroll through the weapons for the armor you picked up
[3:43:58] <lotharrio> There is all that murder they did to people who couldn't fight back.
[3:43:58] <$legacy0117> So yeah, all this Sh*t...This drama? I literally shoved my way past all the red tape and walked up to those sith lords and lightsabers them until they stopped moving. I really don't remember all these idiot Jedi getting in my way.
[3:43:58] <%Gruhunchously> Aside from all the murder
[3:44:02] <ralphfromdk> Evil in the honor way
[3:44:08] <tuesti> that sounds evil
[3:44:08] <derap41> Khornes not evil I guess
[3:44:09] <%jiggy_snipe> Mando just wants to fight all the time
[3:44:10] <asurite_warrior> Genuine Concern: Oh I missed my kill shot and mearly maimed that Organic sack, How unfortunate.
[3:44:12] <CastellanVon> It’s evil
[3:44:12] <gastherobots> Randomly killing innocents to goad an army to fight is pretty evil.
[3:44:13] <DSD24> They still killed a bunch of women and children though
[3:44:17] <alrobot2014> don't forget the mando slavery
[3:44:17] <subjectg> it’s very much lawful evil
[3:44:18] <%ThePimpGuin> spartan evil
[3:44:25] <megamirk> Mandalore before Canderous was pretty evil
[3:44:29] <megamirk> but also badass
[3:44:32] <lotharrio> Death-Tortured all those cat people.
[3:44:32] <+SpectrumSpy> No it's super evil, wanton bloodshed is traditionally evil
[3:44:33] <dereks0n> I'd argue it's Chaotic Evil
[3:44:34] <%DemonOfSalt> Light Side =\= Good.
[3:44:37] <andrei11dr> The mandalorians would stomp babies to get the fights though

[3:45:11] <%Gruhunchously> LUL
[3:45:14] <alrobot2014> you gotta be grey as fuck
[3:45:18] <%Chatterbox1991> I mean its Dantooine
[3:45:24] <megamirk> he dead
[3:45:24] <grandark_z317> so Kreia can use them.
[3:45:25] <+DorianCreed> He's dead on Rakata
[3:45:26] <olaksi> Are we panty raiding jolee's wardrobe right now LUL
[3:45:27] <Space_Pagan> Real Grey Jedi hours
[3:45:28] <+DorianCreed> RIP Jolee
[3:45:28] <tuesti> literally the only neutral thing/buff in the game
[3:45:28] <derap41> How are clothes deciding morality
[3:45:29] <Redblood801> Yeah. "Knowledge"
[3:45:31] <gandalfsmagicgaydick> His corpse is in a fucking Rakata temple
[3:45:34] <Halospaz117> Oh yeah he died in this timeline
[3:45:39] <%Chatterbox1991> Kreia
[3:45:40] <DatAsuna> it didn't imprt your save so
[3:45:41] <dereks0n> @subjectg I suppose, I just view raining down war droids and explosion boners to be chaotic
[3:45:42] <megamirk> next to Carth and Carth's son
[3:45:45] <derap41> XD
[3:45:52] <Halospaz117> Those are some dapper robes
[3:45:55] <%andrex2311> LUL
[3:45:59] <DSD24> Nah man he came back like Lelianna in Dragon Age Inquisition
[3:46:01] <+doc_ock_rokc> Jolee and Kreia never interacting is the BIGGEST WASTE EVER
[3:46:07] <olaksi> And in that instant Woolie fell
[3:46:12] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus I've said it before, and I'll say it again. being a lightside sith is great. you'll still kill a motherfucker if they disrespect you, but you give then a job offer before you drop a saber through their neck
[3:46:14] <notenoughgirls> the jedi robes in this game look pretty good
[3:46:30] <DSD24> The robes looked pretty bad in Kotor 1
[3:46:44] <zocano> The jal shey stuff is still my favorite
[3:46:48] <subjectg> @dereks0n they are, but they have a definable cause for their slaughter, though it gets muddled cuz “battle for the sake of it” IS part of their code
[3:47:03] <StarlitStunner> SWTOR and Gendi Wars make a good balance between armor and robes
[3:47:07] <megamirk> who the fuck names their son Azkul
[3:47:16] <zocano> A nazgul
[3:47:27] <lotharrio> Well... A leader of the Exhange.
[3:47:36] <%Gruhunchously> A leader of the Exchange

[3:47:51] <DatAsuna> i's a disruptor
[3:47:51] <%DemonOfSalt> @doc_ock_rokc I think we can safely assume that Kreia would look at Jolee and mutter her equivalent of "filthy casual, get on my level". XD
[3:47:55] <+DorianCreed> OH SHIT, IT'S HK'S RIFLE
[3:48:01] <DatAsuna> it's real good
[3:48:03] <+doc_ock_rokc> Goto What isthis shit. "Hrrmmm seems some asshole is trying to take my shit"
[3:48:07] <subjectg> charric is endgame rifle
[3:48:09] <StarlitStunner> Power of GUN
[3:48:10] <DatAsuna> there are multiple guilds
[3:48:19] <%Gruhunchously> @DemonOfSalt And Jolee would look at her and do the same
[3:48:23] <+DorianCreed> @WoolieVersus It's the best Crit rifle in the game, give it to HK
[3:48:34] <%Chatterbox1991> think different families in the Mafia
[3:48:40] <+doc_ock_rokc> @DemonOfSalt Ether they'd be best friends that secretly hate eachother or massive "Married couple" energy

[3:49:08] <%DemonOfSalt> @Gruhunchously For sure.
[3:49:10] <gandalfsmagicgaydick> Slap droid
[3:49:18] <RrenKrieg> how?
[3:49:20] <lotharrio> ...oh you probably put something on his guns that required feats to use he didn't have.
[3:49:34] <%Chatterbox1991> you can totally bring Goto with you to talk Mercenaries out of attacking you
[3:49:41] <Redblood801> We could also cheat for influence. Not saying we should but
[3:49:45] <%Chatterbox1991> in certain circumstances
[3:49:47] <%Gruhunchously> The Kreia way vs the HK way
[3:50:02] <+krlos970> Looks like a good guy
[3:50:06] <$legacy0117> So yeah, I destroyed Goto drone, So what does that mean story wise? I need to download this game just to try to find out how my first playthrough went. Cause I remember things being a lot less talkative.
[3:50:14] <%Gruhunchously> Oh hi again Robin Atkin Downes
[3:50:16] <Manjove> oh, look its Malgus
[3:50:29] <RrenKrieg> 4x the exp
[3:50:37] <gastherobots> Oh shit it totally is @Manjove
[3:50:43] <Joostebrood> iirc you can get HK-47 influence without dark side points during Khoonda defence
[3:50:49] <Sapphire_Breeze> the trolley problem huh
[3:50:57] <+thebetterbard> OH NO
[3:50:58] <%FallenAngelZelos> Don't know what it is, but I feel like this guy might be bad news....
[3:51:04] <Joostebrood> though I don't know if TSLRCM changes that like it does Nar Shaddaa Bao-Dur
[3:51:05] <SnaKemuho> how stupid is he to put out his entire plan for you
[3:51:06] <olaksi> Can't you see this is the lesser evil??
[3:51:08] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @thebetterbard
[3:51:38] <StarlitStunner> Claps with single hand
[3:51:43] <%DemonOfSalt> Kreia reacting to Lie: *excited breathing*
[3:51:49] <kamichilli> oi oi
[3:51:50] <lotharrio> G0-T0 might like the actual evil
[3:52:00] <lotharrio> Because it works the numbers
[3:52:06] <Joostebrood> granny likes the non-lie version as well
[3:52:06] <%DorianCreed> DorianCreed subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Hey, Woolie, worth noting for future things, the number you're looking for on a gun for HK is a crit of 18-20 if upgradable, or a crit of 16-20 if not, as this gives him a 100% crit rate with Sniper Shot, meaning Assassination Protocols is his real crit
[3:52:08] <subjectg> G0-T0 hates the mercs actually
[3:52:20] <Joostebrood> just cause you have maximum options whether you mean it or not
[3:52:23] <subjectg> because they are a destabilizing force
[3:52:25] <%DemonOfSalt> G0-T0 wants you to protect the republic.
[3:52:34] <SnaKemuho> and then there's TRUE EVIL where you kill his mercs and THEN let him take over
[3:52:36] <%Irridium> as light and light later as things seem
[3:52:56] <Manjove> if you like shades of morality, Tyranny is a great rpg about different kinds of evil.

[3:55:23] <notenoughgirls> hk was actually more blue earlier
[3:55:31] <MarkUriah> CAndo has less influence

[4:02:16] <SnaKemuho> what's with the Mira sandbag
[4:02:16] <damienlunas> At least finish off her influence so that we can hear all of her story and at least have more to criticize if he doesn't like it
[4:02:31] <DatAsuna> give her one of those bottom ones
[4:02:40] <%FallenAngelZelos> @SnaKemuho Woolie finds her boring and would rather have the angry wookie
[4:02:43] <%OldManDeckardCain> train her wrong, as a joke
[4:02:45] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> BLAZING
[4:02:47] <%DorianCreed> Look at that 3.5e carry-over feat
[4:02:52] <+Buzzkill983> She is a Scout, she needs to run fast so Hanharr can't eat her
[4:02:53] <SnaKemuho> @FallenAngelZelos mind goblins then
[4:02:55] <%LordSDB> 10% Good sir!
[4:02:55] <%andrex2311> Mira? Useful? woolieMIRIN
[4:02:58] <%FallenAngelZelos> @SnaKemuho Also she makes several dumb decisions when she was first introduced
[4:02:59] <%SirGO0SE> SPEED
[4:03:00] <%MrRabbles> Mira 10%
[4:03:06] <damienlunas> MIra is probably the best blaster user
[4:03:06] <Space_Pagan> RUNNING around at the speed of light!
[4:03:08] <megamirk> at least she's kinda hot
[4:03:11] <%DorianCreed> Don't give her the Charric, you fool!

[4:07:48] <asurite_warrior> I gargle steel wool every morning
[4:07:51] <CastellanVon> Is this guy falling asleep
[4:07:59] <bearalin> In a game titled “Sith Lords” who would’ve thought that there would be more dark side options
[4:08:06] <gandalfsmagicgaydick> Before the fight starts I'd recommend putting some heavy hitters in your party
[4:08:08] <%OldManDeckardCain> "Bring me 5 nicotine patches, jedi"
[4:08:14] <dinnydanny777> I think he wants to seduce you
[4:08:17] <AvailableThor> He's so tired he's basically a Dark Souls NPC.
[4:08:24] <%gatorafan> Your men shouldn't have pressed the "attack friendlies" option
[4:08:34] <+Zanco23> @ATPsoldat They're making fun of people who like Mira, and saying this is the only reason they like her. They then put a mask over her face to make it extra funny.
[4:08:47] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus Mira and G0T0 both like you helping one of the mechanics outside
[4:08:47] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:09:05] <Hstakes7> It increases your XP to go through all the BS, so it's worth it
[4:09:05] <%Gruhunchously> Light Side points
[4:09:12] <+xerotwo> Set phasers to KILL
[4:09:13] <gastherobots> Why was that even an option.
[4:09:15] <%Irridium> dude to the left there yucking it up
[4:09:16] <+MagicBeanBurrito> they're not worth saving
[4:09:23] <+MagicBeanBurrito> KREIA WAS RIGHT
[4:09:24] <xiccy> PUT G0T0 IN YOUR PARTY
[4:09:24] <GarbageNirvana> Space boomers
[4:09:25] <+Buzzkill983> It's more that there are so many enemies, it would take too much time to kill them all before they killed people
[4:09:44] <ATPsoldat> What is that other guy doing?
[4:09:56] <asurite_warrior> @WoolieVersus There is no farming skill woolie that's what these people do.
[4:10:17] <DatAsuna> real g0t0 mira hours

[4:11:00] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus Atton has no influence gain hre, swap hm out for g0t0
[4:11:02] <subjectg> heal them yourself for light side points
[4:11:04] <Manjove> its where your mouse is at

[4:11:25] <dinnydanny777> Light side points for shooting first
[4:11:43] <+sevorai> Could’ve healed them all then fixed robot for model ightside

[4:13:55] <absolute_cagemony> but mira sucks
[4:13:57] <ATPsoldat> @Irridium But that would get rid of the challenge that she could learn from.
[4:14:01] <subjectg> you really wanna give that gun to hk

[4:14:35] <SmortyPuffin> 15 is not 1 in 4

[4:15:27] <abelincoln_catpuncher> ahhhhh'
[4:15:27] <%FallenAngelZelos> Nice chat
[4:15:29] <%DorianCreed> @WoolieVersus Make sure to give that gun to HK once you're done with the thot
[4:15:32] <+BlockingDisabled> Then you factor in master crit shot equals like 90 crit
[4:15:36] <%xcompleasedad> Fucking 40 Damage ever 4 shots
[4:15:41] <+Zanco23> I remember getting used to all the crazy armor your party has at the end of each of the KOTOR games. Then going back to the movies, and being confused with Luke's basic clothes and lightsaber at the end of Episode 6. I remember instinctually wanting to go to a menu that didn't exist to equip Luke with better gear.

[4:15:59] <dinnydanny777> Can you stun enemies and use guns to guarantee hits?
[4:16:06] <subjectg> @blockingdisabled not quite, it’s 11-20 (50%), but that’s pretty good still
[4:16:38] <+BlockingDisabled> Didn't Master Crit Shot like triple the threat range?
[4:16:42] <akman14> How long till the break?
[4:16:44] <absolute_cagemony> Man, remember when Woolie used to play fighting games?
[4:16:48] <%Chatterbox1991> SET THEM TO PATROL
[4:16:49] <lotharrio> Oh that's the problem, someone set this thing to "evil."
[4:16:49] <%DorianCreed> @BlockingDisabled Quadruple it
[4:16:52] <%Chatterbox1991> WOOLIE
[4:16:56] <%Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus Take Atton out of the party really quick
[4:17:04] <gandalfsmagicgaydick> You don't have to set them to patrol
[4:17:05] <Joostebrood> iirc you could kill Akkere (in 'self-defence') by trying to turn him in without gaining dark side points and you'd gain influence with HK for it
[4:17:09] <absolute_cagemony> make atton get mira pregnant
[4:17:10] <fuji_92> Yes
[4:17:11] <subjectg> @blockingdisabled it works a bit differently when you factor in keen, unfortunately

[4:24:57] <+Zanco23> Atton out of party
[4:24:57] <lotharrio> I think if you just try to get him to join, without using the hydrospanner, then you can buy it from that.
[4:25:14] <dinnydanny777> Darth Plagueis really discovered this one neat trick

[4:28:01] <DatAsuna> American morality
[4:28:16] <gandalfsmagicgaydick> According to the internet: You can also get Thorium charges from Akkere, the droidshop owner on Dantooine. When you ask him to join the militia, don't use the Hydrospanner option on him. There are other dialogue choices that will lead to you buying the charges from him, and in turn he will join the militia.

[4:31:01] <+lag2993> what about the sith emperor in tor
[4:31:03] <lotharrio> Huh, I got him to adopt the girl. I'm surprised you got into a political debate.
[4:31:03] <gandalfsmagicgaydick> Yeah, because there are would never be any wars without Jedi...
[4:31:04] <DatAsuna> Not every time but like 85% of the time
[4:31:11] <+evbites> failure from day one
[4:31:24] <+Zanco23> Yeah, but there are plenty of chunks of time where there are no major Sith.

[4:31:37] <gade177> I find ur lack of faith disturbing.
[4:31:43] <%Malik1002> I like how all the times in the star wars history that when a jedi fell they would start the biggest fucking war ever !!!!!
[4:31:51] <gandalfsmagicgaydick> Well, without the Jedi though the Mados would have killed all of you
[4:32:08] <heartlesshealer> jedi are [insert politics]
[4:32:13] <%jiggy_snipe> weren't people asking for jedi help during the Mando war?
[4:32:13] <%gatorafan> Reminds me of certain someone we just talked to
[4:32:22] <+lag2993> technically its cause of the sith that the mandos didnt destroy the universe
[4:32:24] <tolloponik> I've dealt with this mentality before
[4:32:35] <gastherobots> This is why I love the Imperial Agent campaign in SWTOR. The ability to tell Sith ordering you around to fuck off and shit talk them behind their back for being dumb space wizards is the best.
[4:32:36] <andrei11dr> It's almost like talking to the Pope
[4:32:36] <ATPsoldat> 3 sounds reasonable.
[4:32:44] <gandalfsmagicgaydick> @lag2993 But they look at the Jedi and Sith as the same anyway
[4:32:50] <FusionFountain> Reminds me of a certain ginger midget
[4:32:52] <lotharrio> That's the BEST PISTOL
[4:32:57] <+evbites> pakk:i'm a crusty space pimp
[4:33:01] <abelincoln_catpuncher> OH SHIT the Disintegrator
[4:33:05] <megamirk> John just gave us points for being a tool
[4:33:06] <Halospaz117> Yeah that conversation went way different for me, I think it's cuz I mentioned she suffered from the war before she was a jedi
[4:33:07] <damienlunas> Is that a gun FOR disintegrating Mandalorians?
[4:33:15] <subjectg> Fuck the charric, give HK the disintegrator
[4:33:19] <gandalfsmagicgaydick> No disintegrations...
[4:33:21] <+lag2993> @gandalfsmagicgaydick true but at least the sith saved the galaxy while the jedi just sat
[4:33:22] <gade177> Would u be interested in dying horribly?
[4:33:33] <RrenKrieg> well, a veteran would add to the militia greatly
[4:33:34] <+SolidusRex> The Mandalorian Disintigrator is the BEST PISTOL IN THE GAME
[4:33:43] <308caliber> FOR MANDALORE SwiftRage
[4:33:53] <%Irridium> I think you can also recruit some of the salvagers
[4:33:56] <gandalfsmagicgaydick> @lag2993 That's irrelevant to the point being made though... if he's looking at all the Jedi as the same then you have to acknowledge when they save you too

[4:36:13] <%tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus Woolie and V, i dunno if you'll see this, but randos would totally use sith as a curse. Han Solo used "sithspawn" as a curse in the OT. its wierder they sue it KOTOR era, when Sith are around; its like you or me using "Naziblood" as a curse
[4:36:16] <+lag2993> @gandalfsmagicgaydick it is in the context of the game you are treating this world view of a particular time through the entire history of jedi and sith, in kotor 2 the jedi refused to act during a time of great crisis and then fought a devastating civil war

[4:36:38] <%Chatterbox1991> >.>
[4:36:41] <$Invlux> Republic ScrubQuotes: Mando Disintegrators are BANNED in local play, too OP
[4:36:42] <heartlesshealer> Blue HK sighted?
[4:36:50] <gandalfsmagicgaydick> @lag2993 I'm talking in the context of the conversation...
[4:37:02] <+lag2993> @gandalfsmagicgaydick that is the context of the conversation
[4:37:04] <andrei11dr> Dude gives you the gun "Yo killed like 50 Jedi, here you hold it a little for me"
[4:37:04] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[4:37:16] <%FallenAngelZelos> V being one guy again?! Kappa
[4:37:48] <tolloponik> but number go down!
[4:37:48] <heartlesshealer> Fully upgradable <3
[4:37:52] <gandalfsmagicgaydick> @lag2993 No, because he was like, "Well they fought themselves" meaning he sees them both as Jedi. Which is the point. They don't care who fought for them, they're all "Jedi" to them. So by his own perspective the "Jedi" saved them from the Mandos
[4:38:01] <%bread_assassin> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[4:38:04] <ATPsoldat> OH TEH NOWS

[4:38:35] <%MrRabbles> Systems failing master
[4:38:36] <heartlesshealer> Best gun to balance out all that blue on HK
[4:38:38] <subjectg> You see why blaster jedi is so good?! Imagine having 5 SHOTS per round of THAT
[4:38:40] <+eanscrale> The only damage reduction you need is your enemies running away when they realize what you're using.

[4:39:30] <Bassman_PhD> mines!
[4:39:36] <%rosemon5001> @BallerSwagBro9k want to join the military? Kappa paiChoccyMilk
[4:39:41] <TomFrank> see the world!
[4:39:42] <%Chatterbox1991> Dragon Age Origins has the best version of that
[4:39:45] <Redblood801> Plant some mines, see what happens
[4:39:48] <%Chatterbox1991> YOU LET ISODE
[4:39:55] <Redblood801> You're not using them
[4:39:56] <gandalfsmagicgaydick> I normally don't play as male, can you recruit Disciple?
[4:40:03] <alrobot2014> no
[4:40:06] <%Gruhunchously> no
[4:40:07] <ATPsoldat> Only as female
[4:40:14] <%Irridium> I've always just laid three - four mines in the middle and it seemed to work
[4:40:15] <+Loinclothiclese> RONA
[4:40:16] <usurper_sos> monkaS
[4:40:16] <subjectg> pick the mines up then, for the xp
[4:40:17] <gandalfsmagicgaydick> Not to the party, to the militia
[4:40:18] <heartlesshealer> Just do it, you'll never mine nor mine exploit
[4:40:22] <+Zanco23> Lot of things don't work in Restored Content, it's frustrating.
[4:40:26] <TomFrank> i have the rona FeelsBadMan
[4:40:26] <Safarihat> You can recruit the mercs at the camp iirc

[4:40:47] <gade177> I hope this guy dies in the fight.
[4:40:51] <heartlesshealer> okay a real answer
[4:40:52] <+lag2993> @gandalfsmagicgaydick you are just picking phrases ignoring the context of what he is saying, if he believed that the jedi saved the republic he wouldnt want them to be extinct. This is evident because he only talks about the dmg caused by the civil war
[4:40:55] <lotharrio> "Sure, I'll kill whoever you want for some smokes."
[4:40:57] <%ThePimpGuin> dude finally made enough to leave the planet and now he gonna die

[4:41:42] <gandalfsmagicgaydick> @lag2993 Right, but his point was, "They're always causing wars!!" When they weren't the cause of the Mando war... which would have fucked him and Dantooine i not for force-weilders intervention
[4:41:44] <%Irridium> lay three in the middle and call it a day
[4:41:44] <andrei11dr> Woolie is turning Sith

[4:46:08] <asurite_warrior> I mean choke point
[4:46:09] <%GraceTBM> the npcs cant see the orbs
[4:46:10] <ralphfromdk> They are farmers, they are used to putting things in neat rows :P
[4:46:12] <RrenKrieg> maybe a funnel?
[4:46:17] <RrenKrieg> funneling the enemy
[4:46:22] <%Malik1002> hey at least spread them around like for real?
[4:46:37] <$legacy0117> Poor Woolie. Had go through the fields and frogs attacked him, and pinched him the throat a little.
[4:46:44] <andrei11dr> Some may say these Wars are talking place among the Stars
[4:46:45] <gandalfsmagicgaydick> Put some heavy bois in your fight
[4:46:45] <$legacy0117> punched*
[4:46:52] <+Zanco23> Bring some Jedi
[4:46:57] <%LordSDB> Bring the Murder Bros
[4:46:59] <%alpacasintophats> What’s yours is mine?
[4:47:01] <khotgor> These mines aren't mine
[4:47:16] <Augus7717> FOR MANDALORE doodRage doodRage doodRage
[4:47:30] <%DorianCreed> @WoolieVersus Give Cando the Mando tjhe Disintegrator and an off-hand Ripper then give HK the Charric
[4:47:31] <lotharrio> Save anywhere system: KIRYUU-CHAN!"
[4:47:33] <kingofgames726> does little v actually live in Montreal
[4:47:44] <zocano> Ah shit did woolie find a Mando Disintegrator
[4:47:48] <DatAsuna> I think he's a toronto boy
[4:47:51] <+Zanco23> Give Mira some modesty please.
[4:48:06] <HaitokuNoHonoo> oh I thought we were ignoring Mira
[4:48:23] <subjectg> @doriancreed nah man, hk’s gonna need that thing, especially for later
[4:48:23] <andrei11dr> Mira doesn't deserve modesty
[4:48:28] <SnaKemuho> what was even the point of having her
[4:48:31] <%Malik1002> HANDMADIEN
[4:48:34] <%OldManDeckardCain> don't take mira's only use in this lp LUL
[4:48:44] <Bassman_PhD> handmaiden!!
[4:48:45] <$Invlux> PogChamp handmaiden
[4:48:49] <%alpacasintophats> V sauce?
[4:48:52] <DatAsuna> well if you're gonna cheat your allignment, just cheat her influence too
[4:48:54] <%alpacasintophats> Aww
[4:48:55] <khotgor> The fact that mira has a different coloured background from everyone else notifies her being the only on in puke-tier
[4:48:58] <%Chatterbox1991> black tunic yeah
[4:49:11] <DSD24> Doesn't Mira change too?
[4:49:23] <DatAsuna> actually she gets that robe because they don't want to give her uggo face
[4:49:24] <Tucker0603> DEW IT
[4:49:27] <%Chatterbox1991> Miras hair becomes more Res
[4:49:30] <+Zanco23> Bao-Dur has extra detail when he goes dark side. Is he a waifu?
[4:49:32] <%DorianCreed> @subjectg The Charric is better for HK because like 99% of his damage comes from his 20% chance to just hard remove a nerd, so giving him a CC stick that also does Unstoppable damage is amazing
[4:49:40] <lotharrio> @Zanco23 Obviously
[4:49:44] <$Invlux> good-ass thetic
[4:49:47] <DatAsuna> yeah the horny bias in dark side corruption for girls is hilarious
[4:49:48] <Bassman_PhD> upgrade her lightsaber!!
[4:49:53] <HaitokuNoHonoo> @Zanco23 absolutely!
[4:50:00] <gandalfsmagicgaydick> @Zanco23 Of course!
[4:50:27] <subjectg> @doriancreed the disintegrator has the same crit chance as a disruptor and better damage, so what use is an inferior rifle?
[4:50:48] <DatAsuna> I used the invisible masks mod and never turned back
[4:50:53] <zocano> Bao-dur is the one true waifu
[4:50:58] <zocano> The true waif
[4:51:01] <%Gruhunchously> One of us
[4:51:08] <%DorianCreed> @subjectg 100% chance to knock down, thus hard disabling someone until they can sort it
[4:51:08] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1262613184097255426
[4:51:18] <%DorianCreed> And yes, I know about the DC on it
[4:51:30] <zocano> It sucks that two handed weapons feel underpowered so often
[4:51:39] <zocano> Cause a big fuck off rifle is cool ):
[4:51:41] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> By getting caught again?
[4:51:44] <gade177> lol
[4:51:45] <+MidnightBurst12> off he goes
[4:51:47] <lotharrio> Lies, he's running off to drink hooch and jerk off.
[4:51:49] <%jiggy_snipe> dies in a mne accident
[4:51:50] <Halospaz117> Just hear explosions once the camera cuts
[4:51:56] <+Zanco23> I placed a lot more mines. Imagine it didn't go well for Vrook.
[4:51:56] <DedlokPM> So I guess that means HK is not cool because he doesn't have one of those masks. doodSad
[4:52:06] <subjectg> @doriancreed with level scaling that knockdown dc is practically worthless, so my point still stands. power shot gives you a better knockdown dc on crit too anyway, if you really need it
[4:52:18] <$Invlux> Just like a real house
[4:52:20] <%Gruhunchously> Yeah, she should just step out into the open field and taunt them
[4:52:29] <jimmytwofeet> my voice is real rough, over
[4:52:36] <subjectg> and besides, if they were weak enough to get knocked down, they should be dead already
[4:52:43] <Dangerzone979> @DedlokPM HK doesn't need a mask because his head looks like *THAT*
[4:52:47] <asurite_warrior> a super under populated planet
[4:52:47] <%Chatterbox1991> Easiest game of Stellaris ever
[4:52:48] <lotharrio> Got nuked
[4:52:51] <megamirk> King Kai's planet
[4:52:54] <$Invlux> This dude needs a lozenge
[4:52:56] <zocano> For some reason it’s the only real settlement on the entire planet
[4:53:00] <Halospaz117> The way I see it Dantooine was already backwater and then just got fucked by Malak
[4:53:04] <zocano> Cause scifi
[4:53:05] <+Zanco23> Every planet in Star Wars is one city
[4:53:08] <jnaynnay> The squad
[4:53:10] <zocano> And scale of planets is hard to do
[4:53:10] <AnacondaVirtue> To be fair, there's probably only like a hundred+ people on Dantooine.
[4:53:50] <solasknight> This must be its capital. I mean it is next to what used to be the Jedi Enclave
[4:54:42] <+big_oki> how long is this game
[4:54:43] <%DorianCreed> @subjectg You're trading 5-6 damage and a reduction in potential swing (1d10 vs 2d6+4) for +2 to hit (which matters a lot when AC scales later) and a chance to knockdown whilst also having the best crit rate.
[4:54:47] <DatAsuna> To be less fair dantooine is a farm planet that supplies multiple other worlds with food
[4:54:51] <gade177> I'm everywhere...and nowhere but mostly i'm everywhere.

[5:05:19] <%LordSDB> But... they are victorious tho
[5:05:20] <zocano> Vrook is the most “traditional jedi council “ of the three
[5:05:24] <Joostebrood> the Vrook boss fight in DS is so satisfying
[5:05:24] <+lag2993> getting lost in the shadows isnt the same as plotting
[5:05:26] <RrenKrieg> Kavar was cool, he almost went you to fight mandos
[5:05:28] <gandalfsmagicgaydick> Which is actually kind of Sidious's plan, except that was execuded over thousands of years
[5:05:29] <wowowinsane> vrook is very emblematic of this jedi council's errors
[5:05:35] <gandalfsmagicgaydick> executed*

[5:05:56] <zocano> Vrook is the clear stuck up jedi council guy
[5:05:57] <Joostebrood> This game has people inconsistently using toponyms all the time
[5:05:58] <Redblood801> He wimped out
[5:06:10] <zocano> Kavar and Zez Kai Ell are honesty cool

[5:11:03] <%jiggy_snipe> Vrook you are not helpful
[5:11:09] <%DensityD> is "cutting off from the force" different from "I'm not force sensitive"? I wasn't paying attention

[5:20:44] <+eanscrale> He's bureaucratic evil
[5:20:45] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Why do I need to find the Jedi? Your stupid plan was for them to magically know when the Sith arrived and gather themselves.
[5:20:46] <Dementedpenguin> So like real life

[5:21:52] <zocano> "here have this lightsaber" says Vrook
[5:21:53] <AvailableThor> As a perfect cheery on the top, he gives you a SHORt lightsaber
[5:21:54] <%DorianCreed> @WoolieVersus V, don't complain -it's a good off-hand lightsaber for dual weilding
[5:21:56] <tolloponik> something to sell
[5:21:56] <DatAsuna> I don't get the wakizashi hate
[5:21:56] <Redblood801> What a fuck
[5:21:57] <HaitokuNoHonoo> just .... practice on the old man
[5:21:57] <%Gruhunchously> The lightsaber is his penis

[5:22:07] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Dealing with him would turn me.
[5:22:08] <subjectg> You have so many lightsabers tho
[5:22:11] <Mayachacha> LUL
[5:22:13] <BlacSoul> LIGHT LATER HIM
[5:22:13] <+griffball13> He is a sith generator
[5:22:14] <Halospaz117> That sounds too long
[5:22:16] <andrei11dr> ResidentSleeper
[5:22:17] <%andrex2311> LUL
[5:22:17] <+eanscrale> Killing this man would be a favor to the republic for sure
[5:22:18] <308caliber> “your force is sloppy” this guy LUL
[5:22:19] <gade177> Using the force as a weapon is bad. Uses the force as a weapon.
[5:22:22] <%DensityD> RedTeam
[5:22:25] <$legacy0117> Can you murder him? Please tell me you can.
[5:22:26] <%OldManDeckardCain> this feels like obsidian fuckup tbh
[5:22:28] <Dementedpenguin> I wonder how the Empire took over so easily 4Head
[5:22:32] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Ironic...
[5:22:32] <DatAsuna> VRook is the windu of kotor
[5:22:35] <Sapphire_Breeze> LUL
[5:22:40] <asurite_warrior> Woolie Take it from a guy who know your dealing with the drill Sargent of the Jedi. @WoolieVersus He has been trained to be the bad guy and give everone gruff
[5:22:47] <TomFrank> true that
[5:22:47] <YakumoYomi> @DatAsuna I guess because they're "pointless", since we've established that you can already adjust the length of a lightsaber on the fly.
[5:22:49] <heartlesshealer> That conversation... Dark side forever, wow.
[5:22:50] <tolloponik> he was poket's Sith maker machine just a VR room with him
[5:22:51] <%Chatterbox1991> Vrook is litterally the Force equivalent of a Flat Earther
[5:23:05] <+ShadowArcangel> After you finish a conversation with Vrook, Revan whispers in your ear "I told yoooou" and then you join Revan's movement
[5:23:11] <+eanscrale> He had tenure
[5:23:15] <Redblood801> Vrook is EVERYTHING wrong with the Jedi order
[5:23:16] <Decimated_body> brotherhood councilman from new vegas
[5:23:18] <$legacy0117> Doesn't matter, no respect? He gets no goddamn respect.
[5:23:19] <Heyestus> I AM the senate
[5:23:20] <grandark_z317> HE DECIDES WHO LIVES AND WHO DIES
[5:23:20] <%Bluemanzee> I see what you're saying
[5:23:23] <%Zohare> He was the one against retraining Revan
[5:23:26] <Kidbizzaro> He exists to be a staunch defender of the status quo.
[5:23:27] <gastherobots> "Vitiate/Revan/Sidious actually listens to my feelings! Fuck you council!"
[5:23:31] <%DensityD> 1234567
[5:23:32] <DatAsuna> @YakumoYomi the point is to emulate samurai dual wielding for style
[5:23:33] <abelincoln_catpuncher> Woolie is DONE
[5:23:33] <308caliber> he puts all the blame on you for following Revan to war
[5:23:37] <gade177> Yeah and that's what's wrong with the Jedi.
[5:23:38] <DatAsuna> it's just aesthetic
[5:23:40] <%DensityD> I like the manga
[5:23:47] <+griffball13> vrook is the kind of guy that the book is all there is and there is nothing outside of it @WoolieVersus
[5:23:48] <%royb2> REVAN WAS RIGHT
[5:23:52] <prince_johnny_> wow
[5:23:54] <%Diana869> break or that it for today?
[5:23:54] <%OldManDeckardCain> kotor 2 is just sith propaganda like how the movies are jedi propaganda Kappa
[5:23:56] <$legacy0117> He decides? Nope, the PLAYER DOES.
[5:23:56] <heartlesshealer> mmmm space religion
[5:24:06] <%BallerSwagBro9k> VROOK 2020 LUL
[5:24:07] <BlacSoul> REVAN DID NOTHING WRONG
[5:24:09] <%Malik1002> THE JEDI ARE THE HEROS OF THIS STORY!!!!
[5:24:11] <Chisas_Dead_Body> You guys gonna come back?
[5:24:11] <%DensityD> and we are leading the Greater Good(s and services)™
[5:24:13] <SpankyMagoo> mjga
[5:24:15] <mihokspawn> Vrook 2020
[5:24:16] <%BallerSwagBro9k> VROOK HAS A MAGA HAT
[5:24:16] <andrei11dr> I would drop some names, but where not getting political here
[5:24:17] <HaitokuNoHonoo> well, there's nothing to fix if nothing remains to be fixed
[5:24:17] <DatAsuna> Vrook is the windu of kotor
[5:24:22] <+Kduff89> now I understand the revan did nothing wrong crew
[5:24:25] <%andrex2311> Pockets was fucking right! wooliePOYO
[5:24:27] <DarkDsion> no wonder there are a lot of sith now
[5:24:29] <RunoEddie> is Vrook even bluer than Fanny right now?
[5:24:32] <%Binary_Fireball> who's worse space marines are jedi?
[5:24:33] <+eanscrale> Oh man, I can SMELL how rank that is
[5:24:36] <subjectg> @woolieversus so for things you missed, you unfortunately missed a great goto moment where you can threaten jorran with legal slavery
[5:24:38] <+UberWolfman> You see this is why the jedi lost the 2016 election
[5:24:40] <%Binary_Fireball> or*
[5:24:43] <gastherobots> Being raised mega religious this kind of story hits even HARDER
[5:24:46] <%DensityD> woolieFABRICATION
[5:24:47] <%HostilePoundcakes> revan did nothing wrong SwiftRage
[5:24:49] <olaksi> He seems like that one old executive that rather lets the company sink slowly than take responsibility for any saving action potentially failing
[5:25:02] <%Chatterbox1991> Yoda looks like Anakin next to Vrook
[5:25:02] <suitangi021> He would tell Luke that he is a Sith
[5:25:09] <grandark_z317> and then Luke goes off and tries to murder his nephew.
[5:25:10] <+SolidusRex> Windu would agree with him probably, he was kind of an asshole sometimes in Clone Wars
[5:25:14] <YakumoYomi> @DatAsuna I get it (since samurai lore heavily influences Star Wars). But why would you need a lightsaber that's made to be specifically short, when lightsabers themselves are made to be adjustable? I'm guessing that the "adjustable" feature is a fairly recent addition to the lore.
[5:25:17] <%Malik1002> I HAVE NEVER SEEN A JEDI FO WRONG BESIDES ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE FALLEN AND THOSE FALLEN STARTING EVERY MAJOR WAR IN THE STAR WARS HISTORY!!!!!!!
[5:25:19] <%ThePimpGuin> Qui-gon would say fuck it and whoop his ass lol
[5:25:24] <gade177> Vrook's not very good at controlling his emotions.
[5:25:24] <StarlitStunner> I love Mace’s silent judgmental eyebrow raises
[5:25:26] <mak0t0yukii> Anakin would lose it
[5:25:26] <gastherobots> It's like no fuck you tell me why this is the way it is council! "No fuck you, you dark sided fuck, obey or get out"
[5:25:44] <%GoldeNOVA> Mace is just Vrook tho
[5:25:51] <%DensityD> RaccAttack cvHazmat
[5:25:51] <Space_Pagan> He's just garbage
[5:25:52] <+griffball13> there is no point in talking to him
[5:25:57] <andrei11dr> Anakin would smack the shit out of him
[5:26:02] <khotgor> Mace was an asshole also
[5:26:02] <suitangi021> Gotta love old man indoctrination
[5:26:03] <%HostilePoundcakes> LUL
[5:26:03] <$legacy0117> Emotion control is just brainwashing. ResidentSleeper
[5:26:05] <abelincoln_catpuncher> I also thought the point of a "short" saber was that the handle itself is designed smaller, similar to comparison to a longsword and a shortsword
[5:26:18] <%Irridium> no it is the children who are wrong
[5:26:18] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1262613184097255426
[5:26:25] <gastherobots> The best part is that it wasn't even working in HIS TIME!
[5:26:30] <andrei11dr> Luke would probably just turn and walk from sentence one
[5:26:32] <+griffball13> everthing has been the same since the beginning of time
[5:26:42] <subjectg> @yakumoyomi watsonian: preference within the jedi for a smaller blade, doylist: more reasonable design decision to make them separate thinggs
[5:26:49] <%Mrbaconator> I AM THE SENATE
[5:26:54] <zocano> I'm excited for the Kavar talk
[5:26:55] <%GraceTBM> that's just cause you can see them in any sequence
[5:27:01] <olaksi> You could fix democracy immediately by adding an upper limit to voting age
[5:27:10] <AvailableThor> Every single one of them are outsourcing the responsibility to the others.
[5:27:14] <asurite_warrior> in the comics Some of the masters did some real fucked shit to try and stop padawans from going dark side
[5:27:17] <+griffball13> I AM THE COUNCEL
[5:27:22] <gade177> Yeah Vrook's a coward.
[5:27:25] <GarbageNirvana> Mistakes were made
[5:27:33] <%SirGO0SE> a circle of people pointing left
[5:27:33] <zocano> Vrook is absolutely supposed to be this character and you are absolutely supposed to get frustrated with him
[5:27:35] <zocano> and it's great
[5:27:39] <+evbites> he is light side papls
[5:27:46] <wowowinsane> vrook is fantastic for this game's story
[5:27:50] <Tucker0603> LIGHTSIDE SITH! Do the right thing and tell anyone who complains to either shut up or eat lightning @woolieversus
[5:27:52] <+VCRUZZO> does anyone remembe that Vrook literaly gathered a group of jedi to go and attack Revan?
[5:27:54] <WanderingBard> Jedi are cool the *moment* they get out of the Temple
[5:27:58] <gastherobots> Oh yeah, he's a great character that gets across exactly what he needs to.
[5:28:08] <subjectg> vrook is thematically appropriate for delivering the game’s message
[5:28:16] <syncdilz> hahahaha
[5:28:30] <%gatorafan> Boomer (nothing)
[5:28:36] <olaksi> @WanderingBard It's like all the Jedi who actually cause good are the fringe ones
[5:28:38] <%DensityD> filibuster
[5:29:13] <%Chatterbox1991> Did you know that this game is amazing?
[5:29:14] <andrei11dr> He just Pats the conversation
[5:29:19] <asurite_warrior> we getting on again later tonight or we done for today?
[5:29:25] <+Zanco23> Makes sense since they're older than the others.
[5:29:25] <olaksi> Pat as a Jedi master LUL
[5:29:41] <%Irridium> Inquisitor has a neat story
[5:29:43] <Ashenik1> Is it over or just a break?
[5:29:47] <DarkDsion> old republic trailers view ?
[5:29:50] <%Zohare> That gift sub is definitely coming up from earlier in the stream
[5:29:55] <DatAsuna> just the word
[5:29:56] <+VCRUZZO> its a class
[5:29:57] <%Irridium> basically a mage
[5:29:59] <Halospaz117> It's just the class name
[5:29:59] <DatAsuna> it's just a word
[5:30:01] <StarlitStunner> Ghost eating is hype, inquisitor Nox is the best
[5:30:03] <heartlesshealer> mirror names
[5:30:18] <Space_Pagan> Just the name
[5:30:23] <gastherobots> Sith Inquisitor is the Gestapo while a warrior would be the army.
[5:30:26] <TomFrank> youll never expect them
[5:30:27] <ralphfromdk> Palpatine is an "inquisitor" class sith :p

[5:30:58] <%sporeian94> sporeian94 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months, currently on a 18 month streak! SnyderCut getting released on HBO Max in 2021. Can't wait for it to come and it still sucks
[5:31:00] <DatAsuna> It has good art
[5:31:03] <+evbites> Wha why
[5:31:04] <DatAsuna> but bad story
[5:31:17] <@Menitta> god...snyder cut...

[5:31:44] <+craftyraichu> Who could forget Luke's evil clones: Luuke and Luuuke
[5:31:55] <andrei11dr> Yea ,they didn't even ripped off a good story
[5:32:00] <DatAsuna> A SIMP lord?
[5:32:09] <%ThePimpGuin> @evbites it would just be the main armor parts not the synthetic attachments to the body
[5:32:17] <+VCRUZZO> lord of Simps
[5:32:22] <+VCRUZZO> Darth Simp
[5:32:23] <AvailableThor> I'm skeptical about these claims of the trilogy ripping off EU shit. There's also the explanation that you can only write so many types of stories about Star Wars, someone in the EU having written it already is a statistical 100%.
[5:32:25] <DatAsuna> dark lord of the simp
[5:32:27] <+Zanco23> @craftyraichu Wasn't there just one? And it was to finish up Mara Jade's arc.
[5:32:32] <andrei11dr> But we already learned about Sion
[5:32:33] <+UberWolfman> Simp Lords worship Darth Talon
[5:32:37] <+VCRUZZO> Simp of the Dark Side

[5:32:46] <$legacy0117> Please chill folks

[5:33:52] <+MagicBeanBurrito> an akbarr race jedi boy
[5:34:02] <gastherobots> @AvailableThor It also wasn't a minor story, it was one of the first major (timeline wise ) post OT stories.
[5:34:10] <%Binary_Fireball> that's the best reason to use the force
[5:34:12] <DatAsuna> martial arts drunken master yeah
[5:34:14] <@Menitta> Oh cool
[5:34:17] <+craftyraichu> @Zanco23 I was deep diving Wookiepedia like a fool the other day, and their was in fact another evil Luke clone made by Thrawn, named Luuuke
[5:34:19] <%DensityD> GOD BLESS THE BETA TESTERS
[5:34:24] <%ThePimpGuin> its obiwan ben larry kanobi?

[5:34:46] <$legacy0117> That's the realistic Jedi.
[5:34:47] <+VCRUZZO> May the Simp ever serve you
[5:34:50] <andrei11dr> I forgot how much there was until you get stuff one the Sith
[5:35:09] <+VCRUZZO> yeah...

[5:35:32] <gastherobots> Underwear counts of force restricting armor.
[5:35:36] <+kewlmyc> What a perv
[5:35:40] <+evbites> what about luke and han
[5:35:49] <%ThePimpGuin> with advanced tech why would clothes not automatically be made so you dont need underwear. think about it.
[5:36:18] <+evbites> @ThePimpGuin thats just better underwaer
[5:36:30] <RunoEddie> the Star Wars audio books are great and more people should listen to then
[5:36:35] <%GraceTBM> @ThePimpGuin having a layer of fabric between your gross bits and your main clothes is valuable everywhere

[5:36:41] <DatAsuna> Vaapad was fucked up
[5:36:52] <+firmlygraspi1> it also just looks good
[5:36:54] <DatAsuna> Vaapad was a total failure
[5:37:03] <suitangi021> form 7 is bullshit
[5:37:06] <@Menitta> Yeah that was a thing for sure
[5:37:09] <%DemonOfSalt> Vaapad is about channeling anger into "righteousness".
[5:37:11] <%masterpiecejeremy> Windu comes from a dark side prominent planet.
[5:37:15] <%Gruhunchously> V's voice is getting very high pitched...
[5:37:15] <KnivesEve> whats green lighsabers then
[5:37:16] <JetpackMcQuack> Give Windu a movie
[5:37:18] <gandalfsmagicgaydick> Vaapad, which is why he can beat Sidious. But like Mace is the only one who can use it
[5:37:24] <+evbites> Swing first
[5:37:24] <+firmlygraspi1> isn't that awesome?
[5:37:25] <DatAsuna> ^
[5:37:28] <StarlitStunner> Everyone of Windu’s apprentices who trained in Vaapaad went dark
[5:37:29] <%ThePimpGuin> nah its built into the cloths so its not underwear its just your only wear
[5:37:30] <%kyh9> It's incredibly aggressive as a style, he's stoic specifically to over-compensate
[5:37:39] <%OldManDeckardCain> he's a black jedi, duh Kappa
[5:37:40] <ghoulishcripple> windu was a force Berserker kinda
[5:37:43] <trinityxlv> i think his form absorbs the darkside from his opponents so the more dark they are the harder he is to actually beat or something like that
[5:37:48] <Kidbizzaro> Its his stoic and uncomprimising demeanor that allows him to use it.
[5:37:48] <suitangi021> Channel the enemies anger back at them through the lightsaber
[5:37:55] <+doc_ock_rokc> Windu is a jedi inquisitor basically. He knows how the dark shit so he can track it down
[5:37:56] <308caliber> yeah his lightsaber form is super aggressive
[5:37:56] <olaksi> It kind defeats the idea of darkside if you can control it
[5:38:03] <%ChoculaUltra> did, did he read the cursed gift sub yet?
[5:38:04] <%HostilePoundcakes> LUL
[5:38:14] <DedlokPM> @WoolieVersus They announced it today
[5:38:15] <+kewlmyc> No, it's real

[5:38:18] <Daxalog> In Harley Quinn
[5:38:19] <%Irridium> it was announed today
[5:38:19] <andrei11dr> Windu was kinda more down with killing people than other Jedi

[5:38:39] <xiccy> nope it's real
[5:38:47] <$Invlux> nobody tell him about System Shock
[5:38:48] <gastherobots> Knights of the Fallen Empire
[5:38:50] <+UberWolfman> 4 HOURS OF TRAAASSHHH
[5:38:51] <%GraceTBM> swow-tor
[5:38:53] <gastherobots> It's a real bad naming convention
[5:38:56] <+VCRUZZO> Damn it!
[5:38:58] <@Menitta> swoah tore
[5:39:01] <fuji_92> MORE LETTERS
[5:39:03] <+CptnCampy61> Nope super confirmed
[5:39:03] <%kyh9> JESUS
[5:39:06] <%Irridium> hey me too!
[5:39:06] <gandalfsmagicgaydick> @UberWolfman Endless TRAAAASHHHHHH
[5:39:07] <RedSqurrl> Me too!
[5:39:07] <%kyh9> I'm so sorry, V
[5:39:09] <+VCRUZZO> I do too
[5:39:09] <%Wonderbot3000> I d o too
[5:39:10] <%phatmac16> me too
[5:39:12] <%ChoculaUltra> me too V, me too.
[5:39:15] <$legacy0117> In Clone Wars animated series he is intense, but exaggerations are too high in that series.
[5:39:16] <DatAsuna> I'm a guildmaster to this day
[5:39:20] <%SirGO0SE> same LUL
[5:39:21] <StarlitStunner> Same
[5:39:24] <Hopit> I got it too, also dropped it in a week
[5:39:28] <olaksi> Bioware was especially bad with outsourcing trailers to CGI studios who knew nothing about the actual game
[5:39:28] <%phatmac16> same
[5:39:33] <ralphfromdk> Yeah, underneath that mmo bullshit, there is actually a some what decent KotoR 3... it's just not that good.
[5:39:34] <%kyh9> I miss my Jedi Knight dictator
[5:39:35] <DatAsuna> Dread Palace is just a GOAT raid
[5:39:39] <%phatmac16> those CGI trailers were amazing
[5:39:40] <gastherobots> It's a fun RPG, a not great MMO.
[5:39:40] <zocano> 2x XP is going on right now btw
[5:39:41] <+Zanco23> Any straight up cheats?
[5:39:43] <%ChoculaUltra> fun fact : in order to use the Founder title today you need to be subbed :)
[5:39:45] <$legacy0117> Mace Windu*
[5:39:50] <DatAsuna> I remember matrix online
[5:39:54] <%ChoculaUltra> so even if you were a founder, jumping back in as f2p, you won't be able to show it off LUL
[5:39:54] <ghoulishcripple> me too, i almost crashed a servers lightsaber economy by selling too many of the crystals
[5:39:56] <GarbageNirvana> It's Double XP until June right now, that plus the sub will basically get you max level in a week
[5:39:56] <zocano> For ppl on the fence, 2x XP is on right now
[5:39:59] <%kyh9> Matrix Online was nuts, I remember being a Pro Machine guy
[5:40:00] <DatAsuna> Didn't care for it
[5:40:03] <+Zanco23> Morpheus dies? :o
[5:40:05] <+ShadowArcangel> Its a lot easier than before to play it as a single player game, what with all the fast travel locations unlocked and stuff like that
[5:40:12] <%WanderingSwordsman> @woolieversus is the double xp still going?
[5:40:15] <@Menitta> So the Matrix MMO was canon right, and since that MMO doesn't exist anymore, does that mean the Matrix universe doesn't exist?
[5:40:19] <+VCRUZZO> yeah
[5:40:23] <%kyh9> Sith Inquisitor is fun, Basically Sith Indiana Jones
[5:40:24] <gastherobots> Companion being on heal is essentially cheats, you will NEVER die.
[5:40:27] <+xerotwo> EZ MODE doodScrub
[5:40:30] <StarlitStunner> Morpheus Orpheus sea shells by the shorepheus
[5:40:31] <DatAsuna> it's a glass cannon tho
[5:40:32] <+ShadowArcangel> or use stealth and force speed to skip mobs
[5:40:32] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[5:40:33] <%kyh9> Sith Inquisitor = Indiana jones
[5:40:33] <+MagicBeanBurrito> you get like 5 different kinds of force lightning as that class
[5:40:38] <DatAsuna> very squishy for raiding
[5:40:40] <%Binary_Fireball> I wish jedi had light-axes
[5:40:44] <$Fortunato5678> Sounds like what you're doing now
[5:40:45] <Explodincatz> sounds boring
[5:40:50] <zocano> Sounds like an MMO
[5:40:56] <%kyh9> GW1
[5:40:58] <Space_Pagan> Riveting gameplay!
[5:41:00] <%kyh9> Guild Wars 1
[5:41:01] <%ChoculaUltra> Sith Jug story is great too. Basically cutting out the fake Sith from the Empire while pissing off all the oldies holding onto stupid traditions that undermine the Sith.
[5:41:02] <+MagicBeanBurrito> shadowbringers?
[5:41:03] <ghoulishcripple> you get a fleshbot npc buddy so they just stand there and eat shit
[5:41:06] <+VCRUZZO> can get through story mode quick as shit
[5:41:06] <%SomersaultJustice> that's just for shadowbringers
[5:41:06] <+GalacticaPhanto> It's late into Shadowbringers tho
[5:41:10] <RedSqurrl> Yus
[5:41:13] <+ShadowArcangel> yep
[5:41:14] <olaksi> It's only in couple places
[5:41:15] <%GraceTBM> @Fortunato5678 but they didn't START doing that, so it feels more earned and interactive
[5:41:16] <%Irridium> yeah that used to be the case
[5:41:18] <%Diana869> only in the current expansion
[5:41:19] <%Irridium> it sucked
[5:41:27] <+VCRUZZO> yeah they were locked to roles early on
[5:41:27] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus having an NPC companion all the time is a swtor thing.
[5:41:29] <%kyh9> WATCH TH E SWTOR CGI
[5:41:30] <%Zohare> Guild Wars 1 is the ultimate version of that
[5:41:31] <+Asagi66> @WoolieVersus thats for only for shadowbringers only nothing earlyer
[5:41:32] <$legacy0117> Lucky those Force lightnings don't drain your lifeforce.
[5:41:33] <+Deano8817> the fucking healer for the sith marauder is the worst party member of very class in the game WEW
[5:41:42] <gastherobots> When it came out, the game was hard as fuck, because without a healer you died so fast and had to grind so much. But now every companion can be every role and the healer breaks any sort of difficulty.
[5:41:52] <Space_Pagan> WATCH THE CGI FOR SWTOR LATER
[5:41:53] <@Menitta> !schedule
[5:41:53] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1262613184097255426
[5:41:58] <%ChoculaUltra> Darth Marr is one of the best things to come out of swtor tbh.
[5:41:58] <DatAsuna> yeah swtor got nerfed way too much for casuals
[5:42:05] <gastherobots> You might as well just skip from cutscene to cutscene.
[5:42:08] <DatAsuna> Marr is fantastic
[5:42:10] <+Proxzo> Hey woolie, are you gonna play Panel De Pon? It's up on Nintendo Online
[5:42:14] <+VCRUZZO> @DatAsuna it did
[5:42:16] <olaksi> The NPC dungeon party feature is great for calling out players who try to blame you for failing parts you cleared with idiot AI though
[5:42:20] <%caffienatedjedi> Man, remember when Galaxies got 'simplified' for casuals
[5:42:32] <HaitokuNoHonoo> have a nice meal guys
[5:42:32] <Space_Pagan> Darth Marr is a treasure
[5:42:38] <andrei11dr> Also HK is finished,
[5:42:46] <DatAsuna> galaxies got it way worse cause it was changing mechanics
[5:42:47] <+VCRUZZO> dadadadaddadadadadadaaaaaaa\
[5:42:51] <$legacy0117> Later!
[5:42:52] <zocano> SWTOR got progressively changed so you can burn through the story as fast as you can and drop it afterwards
[5:42:53] <DatAsuna> swtor just nerfed all the numbers
[5:42:55] <+xerotwo> SERIOUS SAM 3 AUGUST RELEASE doodCrazy
[5:42:56] <andrei11dr> And a bunch of new dialogue
[5:43:09] <%Binary_Fireball> I want dokapon on the switch so bad
[5:43:09] <%Chatterbox1991> Fapfapfapfapfap
[5:43:11] <+VCRUZZO> ah
[5:43:13] <+xerotwo> GAME OVER YEAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!! doodCrazy\
[5:43:14] <Torgue_1> @xerotwo 4, not 3
[5:43:15] <HaitokuNoHonoo> later
[5:43:17] <%BurningSaph> YEEEEAAAAAAAAH
[5:43:19] <+xerotwo> GAME OVER YEAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!! doodCrazy
[5:43:20] <%Irridium> SWTOR also changed its flashpoints so you could straight up just run through it alone with NPC's. No players needed.
[5:43:20] <%HostilePoundcakes> GAME OVER YEAH
[5:43:32] <+xerotwo> @Torgue_1 oh my bad lol
[5:43:36] <OverlordLuna> SourPls
[5:43:45] <DatAsuna> @Irridium only the story ones
[5:43:46] <+xerotwo> SERIOUS SAM 4 AUGUST RELEASE doodCrazy
[5:43:57] <+xerotwo> SourPls
[5:44:01] <%BurningSaph> B U T !
[5:44:02] <DatAsuna> THe main challenge left in SWTOR is the dread masters because you have to raid for that storyline
[5:44:02] <+xerotwo> B U T ! ! ! ! !
[5:44:04] <gastherobots> It's super weird because the kept the insane amount of HP bosses have in the expansions (because they were really designed to be like flashpoints) so you will never die, and it'll take like 10 minutes of just sitting and waiting for their HP to drop as you mindlessly pop your abilities.
[5:44:04] <notgarza> B U T
[5:44:09] <OverlordLuna> B U T !
[5:44:15] <$Invlux> BUT!
[5:44:18] <+xerotwo> doodLewd
[5:44:19] <zocano> Now's a good time if you want to blitz through SWTOR story stuff
[5:44:32] <zocano> get 1 month of sub so you get all the restrictions taken off and just blaze it
[5:44:35] <DatAsuna> If any boss fight took you more than 5 minutes you're terrible at the game. lol
[5:44:40] <+Deano8817> I have like 3 character campaigns in swtor I wanna do
[5:44:43] <DatAsuna> straight up
[5:44:48] <khotgor> so... what the hell is being played right now?
[5:44:51] <khotgor> Oh
[5:44:54] <khotgor> Bible Black
[5:45:02] <+xerotwo> D I S A P P O I N T E D ! ! ! doodCrazy
[5:45:03] <zocano> I should go finish the other class stories
[5:45:06] <$Invlux> DISAPPOINTED
[5:45:06] <Explodincatz> POINTED
[5:45:17] <infinite_rotation> Oh fuck
[5:45:17] <$Invlux> like even if you want to
[5:45:25] <zocano> I did Bounty Hunter first and genuinely liked it more than I thought even though it's still kinda boring MMO shit
[5:45:25] <+xerotwo> B U T !
[5:45:28] <%BurningSaph> B U T !
[5:45:38] <gastherobots> Nah, basegame bosses go down quick. But again, bosses in the expansion just have so much HP. And again they aren't a threat. Solo is just slow.
[5:45:40] <AkumaFalcon93> Lmao is the stream over
[5:45:42] <DatAsuna> I actually enjoy the social aspect of swtor
[5:45:45] <+xerotwo> I C E B U R G
[5:45:54] <infinite_rotation> B U T
[5:45:55] <+xerotwo> W A T E R L I N E S !
[5:45:57] <DatAsuna> decorating our guild hangout spots and just chilling with friends, running events
[5:46:06] <$Invlux> It's nice to know that one of my most fond memories of old SBFP streams was just woolie's sense of humor on stream end
[5:46:09] <infinite_rotation> What the shit is even going on
[5:46:09] <DatAsuna> some people run escape room strongholds lol
[5:46:11] <+xerotwo> S U R F A C E
[5:46:17] <gastherobots> Honestly you don't even need the double XP, without being a subscriber you'll still keep level with the planets. Double XP massively overlevels you and then you get debuffed to the planetary levels.
[5:46:25] <zocano> Ya double xp is unnecessary
[5:46:30] <zocano> but it just extra helps
[5:46:34] <infinite_rotation> Show off
[5:46:47] <TheFramedWarlock> Is the stream finished ?
[5:46:49] <DatAsuna> yeah the vanilla content was nerfed to be mainlinable years ago
[5:46:54] <+xerotwo> doodCrazy B I S O N ! ! ! ! doodCrazy
[5:46:57] <Explodincatz> BISON
[5:47:07] <+xerotwo> doodCrazy K O N A M I ! ! ! ! doodCrazy
[5:47:18] <khotgor> Trash. Trash Everywhere
[5:47:26] <+Kitafin> SA KOI
[5:47:32] <heartlesshealer> A Grimaldi Classic
[5:47:33] <zocano> I still think the MMO structure clashes super hard with their desire to make the storylines and it's frustrating
[5:47:33] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[5:47:35] <$Invlux> AAUUUUUUU
[5:47:39] <infinite_rotation> God fuckin damnit, fuck you konami
[5:47:40] <%That_Mojo> mommy, what is that sound
[5:47:44] <+xerotwo> AAAAAUUUUUUUUUUU
[5:47:50] <%That_Mojo> why, that's jesus
[5:47:53] <zocano> cause sometimes there's good story beats and then it gets dulled out or wasted because it has to be an MMO
[5:47:55] <Slimeking_Mike> AUUUUUUUUUUU
[5:48:04] <%That_Mojo> AAAAAAAAAAOU
[5:48:10] <DatAsuna> It's not really an MMO thing
[5:48:11] <+SolidusRex> AAAAAAUUUUU
[5:48:15] <+xerotwo> AAAAUUUUUUUUUUU
[5:48:18] <+Jackernaut> AAAUUUUUUUUUUU
[5:48:23] <DatAsuna> it's more of the usual budget thing with "your choices matter"
[5:48:48] <BlacSoul> Spike the baby
[5:48:56] <heartlesshealer> 8^|
[5:48:57] <DatAsuna> Turns out when someone can maybe live or maybe die, it's twice as expensive for them to be in the story after that
[5:49:00] <+xerotwo> SourPls
[5:49:01] <$Invlux> sometimes with MMOs I'd actually get into an event or cutscene and then when it's over it would kick me back into the world and seeing like 15 other people standing around ruined it
[5:49:02] <%BurningSaph> SourPls
[5:49:04] <zocano> Sure but I always got the feeling the class storylines being forced to follow specific planets depending on faction on top of only getting a certain amount of time on each planet restricts it hella hard
[5:49:13] <+xerotwo> B R A V E N E W W O R L D SourPls
[5:49:18] <%SirGO0SE> SourPls
[5:49:23] <DatAsuna> THink of a telltale game when you choose not to kill someone so they walk out of the story anyway
[5:49:32] <zocano> Ya that absolutely happens
[5:49:33] <$Invlux> getting Trigger to animate this OP was a good get
[5:49:36] <zocano> I don't disagree
[5:49:45] <zocano> I just think the MMO structure double hurts it on top of that
[5:49:49] <DeltascapeV4> Name of the song?
[5:50:02] <infinite_rotation> What the shit is clonoa doing there?!
[5:50:02] <heartlesshealer> Brave New World, opening to Namco x Capcom
[5:50:03] <zocano> restricted to follow faction planet order + you can't ever *really* change events
[5:50:03] <+SolidusRex> Dat Taki
[5:50:05] <+xerotwo> SourPls B R A V E N E W W O R L D SourPls
[5:50:08] <zocano> cause it's an MMO
[5:50:11] <DatAsuna> that's more to do with strict area progression
[5:50:12] <DeltascapeV4> Ty
[5:50:18] <DatAsuna> not inherent mmo structure
[5:50:33] <heartlesshealer> also featured in remixed versions for the later crossover games
[5:50:49] <gastherobots> Hey, they might not ever show up again, but they'll sure find your @jediknight email and let you know how they're doing!
[5:50:51] <heartlesshealer> but their openings aren't as banger as this
[5:51:02] <DatAsuna> I think people just have too narrow an idea of what mmo means
[5:51:11] <zocano> I'm not sure I follow with strict area progression
[5:51:21] <zocano> feels like we're saying the same thing but in different words
[5:51:34] <$Invlux> RIP all these dead IPs
[5:51:39] <+xerotwo> doodHokey TO TRASH HE RETURNS doodHokey
[5:51:43] <%BurningSaph> woolieTRASH Back to where Vrook belongs woolieTRASH
[5:51:44] <DatAsuna> Strict area progression IE planets having set level ranges and orders with 1 social rea and 4 main areas to explore
[5:51:46] <heartlesshealer> I think one of them's still alive
[5:51:47] <+xerotwo> doodHokey TO TRASH HE RESTS doodHokey
[5:51:49] <zocano> Having a set time on each planet based on levels hinders story writing progress
[5:51:50] <zocano> ya
[5:51:50] <heartlesshealer> maybe
[5:51:54] <DatAsuna> That's one of swtor's pacing problems
[5:51:56] <infinite_rotation> Trash
[5:51:58] <zocano> It isn't *strictly* inherent to MMOs
[5:52:00] <DatAsuna> but it's not an inherent MMO thing
[5:52:00] <zocano> I agree
[5:52:05] <infinite_rotation> Hey look its pats mom!
[5:52:08] <heartlesshealer> return to trash
[5:52:14] <heartlesshealer> Enjoy the break, everyone
[5:52:15] <DatAsuna> anyway seeya in an hour
[5:52:17] <+xerotwo> doodHokey MAY THE TRASH KING RISE UP AGAIN doodHokey
[5:52:21] <infinite_rotation> Pats mom
[5:52:21] <zocano> o/
[5:52:22] <gastherobots> TRASH
[5:53:01] <kkjingles> Thank you so much for a playing my game
[5:54:54] <oval31> Hmm

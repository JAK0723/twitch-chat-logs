[0:16:53] <%yeknomlive> they're new v skills
[0:16:55] <AustinApa> G is the same he ever was and thats exactly the way he needs to be
[0:17:11] <Solidnick18> it's been free a few times
[0:17:16] <Overhaul180> @artificiallynatural Generally more defensive tools like dodges and parries or installs like making a move better
[0:17:35] <Tucker0603> I just want my lady Seth...
[0:17:42] <Overhaul180> Or in some cases safe pressure enders like Kage and Ken
[0:17:43] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> G is now Q
[0:17:46] <C_Ranked> Woolieeeeeeeeeeee
[0:17:53] <+ggbhtg> Abigail got dem Discount Tire Company combos @woolieversus
[0:18:08] <+michingmallecho> Netcode: why they don’t want me man😞
[0:18:09] <KaironFortressKnight> they buffed my boys Alex and Ed. I could not be happier

[0:18:14] <%BrooklynAIA> lol
[0:18:16] <boxofhooligans> Ooo, I see, playing some screet fighter!
[0:18:26] <%BrooklynAIA> projectile divekicks
[0:18:27] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Guile V skill 2 is actually hella unsafe
[0:18:29] <OldManDeckardCain> That Time I Reincarnated as Guile Who Can Throw Sonic Booms in the Air
[0:18:30] <Keero_orphen> woolie look like he's in pajamas
[0:18:32] <AustinApa> G and Q link to the real life Q
[0:18:34] <+dramajoe> sideways sonic boom looked so stupid
[0:18:53] <burst_blade> Jimmy loves that cheap shit
[0:18:56] <burst_blade> i'm here for it
[0:19:01] <+michingmallecho> Sonic cross is still cool but air fireball GivePLZ
[0:19:07] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Cheap shit is the best shit

[0:19:29] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> no
[0:19:31] <+McSoliace> cheap shit is fun when it's universal
[0:19:33] <MutedMimic> DansGame
[0:19:40] <+2DSuperiority> mrrobo4Naaaa ahegao pants
[0:19:42] <+ggbhtg> Why is there still only ONE SUPER
[0:19:46] <+michingmallecho> anitaS
[0:19:50] <NotHereToStream> cr mk
[0:19:50] <Solidnick18> ehhh
[0:19:50] <AustinApa> also if anybody wants to play my G my CFN is Dingodice
[0:19:59] <crazydiamond_99> ed got them hands
[0:19:59] <Overhaul180> There's as little daylight between tiers as there's ever been in the game, even moreso than S4
[0:20:03] <%jinking79> Ryu vskill did nothing for him
[0:20:09] <Jaku2011> Woolie looks like a tree
[0:20:11] <+ggbhtg> HOW is there still ONLY ONE SUPER?
[0:20:13] <SomersaultJustice> ryu's vskill 2 should be a fake fireball
[0:20:16] <OldManDeckardCain> HIGH RISK
[0:20:16] <+michingmallecho> Ryu is not back. He’s just peeking behind the akuma shoulder
[0:20:17] <+ggbhtg> HOW SWAY
[0:20:23] <spacebanditooo> yeyeyeye
[0:20:26] <boxofhooligans> Kolin, and Necalli got some cheap new V Skills.
[0:20:32] <Dao_Puppy> Ryu is still 10% of the picks, does he really need buffs that will make him 15 or 20% of the matches played?
[0:20:42] <+Deko_> cr.mp hype
[0:20:44] <%CaptainPileDriver> TIRE JUGGLES
[0:20:47] <Crashfan01> That's your punishment for maining stale bread Ryu
[0:20:54] <+Polter_ge1st> Ryu needs Air Fireballs
[0:20:55] <Arek_1> LK Tatsu (sometimes MK Tatsu)juggles after EX Donkey Kick for good oki.
[0:21:01] <zayasu> abigail is top tier again :(
[0:21:05] <OldManDeckardCain> and Menat reminds us Rose will never make it TearGlove
[0:21:08] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @ggbhtg
[0:21:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> GILL HAS A BETTER PARRY THAN RYU @WoolieVersus
[0:21:12] <+TirinPyron> Juri can charge a stationary fireball. Kappa
[0:21:13] <Solidnick18> that would make him to good
[0:21:15] <+Milpool> Its abig deal!
[0:21:17] <+ggbhtg> Imma yell Moo
[0:21:19] <+zanzibar_junker> Ryu can combo Tatsus again
[0:21:21] <%jinking79> Gill took the Real Parry
[0:21:24] <Overhaul180> Gill has to choose high or low
[0:21:29] <Overhaul180> That's the tradeoff
[0:21:30] <NotHereToStream> gill has to block high and low while ryu can block both
[0:21:31] <+ggbhtg> Imma YELL for da BELLE TIRE
[0:21:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus GILL IS PLUS ON PARRY UNLIKE RYU
[0:21:38] <AustinApa> @woolieversus G IS A FREEMASON AND Q IS QANON
[0:21:43] <boxofhooligans> Ryu needs fake Fireball animation like SNK LUL
[0:21:47] <Arek_1> Cancel cancel recovery frames.
[0:21:56] <Solidnick18> lol
[0:21:56] <jase__x> They are afraid to give Ryu anything cool
[0:21:56] <Arek_1> Can cancel*.
[0:22:05] <+ggbhtg> Anti Ryu Fighter 5
[0:22:11] <jase__x> which is why evil ryu exists
[0:22:12] <AustinApa> G really is a freemason though
[0:22:21] <+royebaty> The old gods fear daigos ryu
[0:22:22] <Overhaul180> Unironically replace Ryu and Ken's functions and put them in Sakura and Sean, make Ryu and Ken the Gouken and Evil Ryu of SF6
[0:22:24] <AustinApa> the Square and compass is right there on his chest
[0:22:28] <+UnbreakableDoof> I demand Twelve and/or Necro in SF6
[0:22:28] <%jinking79> in the Beta he was
[0:22:31] <Jaku2011> But why do you parry
[0:22:33] <+ggbhtg> Mr. Fundamentals, AND NOTHING MORE
[0:22:34] <+zanzibar_junker> Ryu should be the boss of SF6
[0:22:37] <+RenoDeGeneric> Oh man a good jumping LK, top tier character
[0:22:39] <+Uulyaoth> twelve? gross
[0:22:43] <AustinApa> a freemason symbol that usually has G right in the middle of it
[0:22:50] <%jinking79> Ryu was scary in the Beta
[0:22:56] <+UnbreakableDoof> Gimme the goo boi

[0:34:32] <+TheBesteban> Yeah, this was made for their breakdance competitions. Red Bull has a whole circuit for those
[0:34:39] <neet98> that Gill costume is banned right?
[0:34:45] <+TopTieramisu> this pyro costume has so much going on
[0:34:46] <+dramajoe> did you see how far that cr mk hit
[0:35:13] <Ianrazz> That Ryu costume is so bad. The only choice for Ryu is Hot Ryu
[0:35:15] <BlackOrchidKI> I un-ironically love that costume for Ryu so much LUL
[0:35:19] <gruff_gridof> back HK is a good anti air
[0:35:21] <Arek_1> I think they got rid of the Red Bull markings on this and Chun-Li's costume and just gave them SFV markings.
[0:35:21] <manolotanaka> b hk is also a good antiair if they try to cross you up
[0:35:21] <+TheBesteban> Gill has an ice kick that AAs better than the elbow

[0:36:29] <Superbro64> the effects here in sfv are quite obnoxious though
[0:36:31] <dreamin_17> probably where they got the Demitri costume from too
[0:36:33] <Guntanks_in_Space> he has a lot of Demitri's shit

[0:37:13] <Arek_1> @CaptainPileDriver All 4 of the tracks are from DMC4, but yeah.
[0:37:21] <%CaptainPileDriver> fair enough

[0:41:43] <+TopTieramisu> wth was capcom thinking when they came up with necalli's story
[0:41:47] <%lordsdb> Necalli is the best thing that came from SFV for me. ill miss him in SFVI
[0:41:51] <%gatorafan> We do combo

[0:42:07] <+TopTieramisu> @lordsdb he was jobbed harder than kotal
[0:42:08] <Guntanks_in_Space> but then loses to getting dick punched

[0:42:42] <Guntanks_in_Space> like Ryu just learns the Shinkuu Cock Destroyer Punch and nut punches Necalli lol
[0:42:43] <%mayorrev> this is a really good costume for chun li woolieYE
[0:42:49] <+Justanotheryoutuber> Necalli always felt like he was supposed to be the main villain for SFV but they back-peddled on that and just threw in Bison instead
[0:43:03] <+TopTieramisu> necalli even has a damn V design on his body
[0:43:09] <beefomkers> Neither of these characters look anything like what they're supposed to
[0:43:16] <+TopTieramisu> he was totally the main baddie at some point
[0:43:16] <bpbranmuffin> Reggie doesnt confirm shit. He always follows thru with combos even on block. Like a real man Kreygasm
[0:43:19] <+worthwhile_off> slam dunk, thank you punk
[0:43:21] <neet98> because Necalli is boring
[0:43:25] <Solidnick18> barf the barf
[0:43:28] <+TopTieramisu> but they got rid of that shit
[0:43:31] <%gatorafan> The question is, does Capcom has the balls to advance the series timeline past 3?
[0:43:37] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> God this Necalli costume is so sick
[0:43:45] <beefomkers> @gatorafan No
[0:43:45] <Guntanks_in_Space> @bpbranmuffin Reggie commits so hard. You can't hate that

[0:43:57] <neet98> past 3 Cody killed everyone in the roster
[0:44:03] <%ChoculaUltra> I wonder how many times Necalli's VA had to record the barf sound
[0:44:04] <$Thorn14> I dont recognize these characters
[0:44:05] <+TopTieramisu> @gatorafan even sf3 was a copout with them bringing back the shotos and eventually chun
[0:44:05] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[0:44:32] <bpbranmuffin> @Guntanks_in_Space His belief in the heart of battle is too strong
[0:44:33] <DensityD> right now it is, and I cannot stress this enough, time for a brofist
[0:44:35] <%lordsdb> @neet98. Cody kills the Camcop universe?
[0:44:52] <neet98> @lordsdb he can
[0:44:57] <beefomkers> Please take into account that there are exactly 0 Street Fighter games that canonically take place in either of the two previous decades
[0:45:00] <neet98> give him time
[0:45:10] <SomersaultJustice> the vskill 1 combo is different now from s1, it doesn't combo into stomps
[0:45:16] <+Carnage9699> These costumes are crazy
[0:45:23] <@Squdnate> Daigo vibes from that super
[0:45:24] <beefomkers> Advancing the timeline past three would put Ryu in his fifties
[0:45:28] <+TheBesteban> I just threw up in my mouth from that punish
[0:45:31] <DensityD> rare footage of Woolie actually having nothing

[0:46:27] <Solidus0101> barf into her purse Kappa
[0:46:30] <Graxe_> Oh yeah, the Necalli puke
[0:46:43] <Ianrazz> Stop barfing in your girlfriends purse Woolie
[0:46:51] <AustinApa> okay i'm back what i miss
[0:46:55] <%BallerSwagBro9k> What's the name 9f the controller they're using?
[0:46:56] <%gatorafan> @guntanks_in_space, he needs to be Abigail sized and have Dhalsim's reach for that, so he's not trying hard enough Kappa
[0:47:07] <+TopTieramisu> YO
[0:47:15] <DensityD> looking like gg
[0:47:17] <TheArrow_> he dreamed
[0:47:20] <DensityD> enjoy watching this
[0:47:26] <civet10> i know woolie has a qanba obsidian
[0:47:30] <+ggbhtg> you're CAUGHT
[0:47:37] <+razielhex> Ha-oh Maru Necalli
[0:47:39] <+bootysteve> God I hate the costumes in this game. Characters are hardly recognizable
[0:47:58] <+razielhex> Soccer Mom Chun-Li
[0:48:06] <DensityD> yes, they are hard to recognize, but surely you can admit that this Necalli looks SICK AF
[0:48:13] <@Menitta> man it's been ages since I played this
[0:48:14] <DensityD> get hype
[0:48:15] <+bootysteve> You could have told me that was c. viper and I would have believed you
[0:48:19] <+TopTieramisu> @bootysteve how else will they come up with triple digit costumes for chun?
[0:48:20] <@Menitta> gonna grab Luciw
[0:48:24] <@Menitta> Lucia*
[0:48:40] <Ianrazz> Im the totally oposite @bootysteve Leather daddy Bison, Vergil Cody and Hot Ryu are fucking POG dude
[0:48:42] <+razielhex> @bootysteve Your account name betrays you. You know it to be false.
[0:48:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> woolie, when you do the forward slash dive, do the light version after the stomp, that should combo i think
[0:48:54] <DensityD> buttons are designed to be pressed ;)
[0:48:57] <%ChoculaUltra> Hot Ryu is the GOAT of all SFV costumes. Don't @ me.
[0:48:57] <dmysta3000> Honestly I wouldnt mind if the Red Bull Chun-li costume was actually for Laura
[0:48:58] <floralkami> wow, this looks fun to play again
[0:49:16] <Smileyhat> So are we for glory or for fun today?
[0:49:19] <DensityD> are you going to sit there and tell me that I shouldn't press the buttons that have the functionality of being pressed :P
[0:49:30] <DensityD> *stares in yomi*
[0:49:31] <SomersaultJustice> reggie can't be stopped
[0:49:37] <Ianrazz> Hot Ryu should be his default costume
[0:49:38] <dragonify_> VS2 sucks tho lol
[0:49:38] <+razielhex> the cell shading on the grundel is... off
[0:49:47] <zayasu> @WoolieVersus ads

[0:51:43] <%ChoculaUltra> what the fuck is this Sagat skin
[0:51:47] <+Troispoint> Sagat's new vskill 2 just doesn't seem as useful as angry scar

[0:51:51] <Kristoffers> Cyberbots
[0:51:54] <Fujiwara_92> Cyberbots
[0:51:56] <neet98> it's crazy how a design change make everyone do a 180 on Seth
[0:51:58] <%Gamefriendly> looks like all your base guy
[0:51:58] <+chaumiester> Her thighs could choke an elephant
[0:52:02] <%mayorrev> Is it bad that i want teacher chun li to give me detention
[0:52:03] <+Justanotheryoutuber> Looks like Dr. Ion from God Hand

[0:52:21] <+Huderga> Chun oh my
[0:52:21] <SomersaultJustice> tiger ghost
[0:52:23] <%gatorafan> Why doesn't the tiger get a costume?
[0:52:24] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> YO thats a sick costume
[0:52:30] <Solidnick18> TIGER
[0:52:34] <+Killsteal_Wolf> TIGER
[0:52:35] <@Menitta> the Gold UI is so garish
[0:52:41] <Kristoffers> I love the roar on the projectile
[0:52:51] <SomersaultJustice> JAGGLE
[0:52:53] <$SilverRoddo> Chun Li? More like Chun OL
[0:52:54] <DensityD> playing the projectile game against Sagat LUL LUL LUL
[0:52:56] <AustinApa> its not garish when you realize ots because G is one making the UI
[0:52:57] <CozyGUNNA> big ASS
[0:53:01] <Guntanks_in_Space> remember that SF The Movie arcade did the Tiger Shot Roars before lol
[0:53:03] <BlackOrchidKI> @Kristoffers It's been there since forever, and I love it always.
[0:53:04] <AustinApa> its all for G
[0:53:06] <+Javaa01> TIGGER
[0:53:11] <+razielhex> I like the old school Thailand stage.
[0:53:14] <+worthwhile_off> TIGER'
[0:53:19] <+chaumiester> This is the first time I'm seeing this game. Chun-Li's ankles look like they would be in so much pain with her stances in heels
[0:53:22] <%Dualities> When's El Fuerte?
[0:53:24] <DensityD> rocket boot
[0:53:25] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Sagat VS 2 is good
[0:53:29] <jerkhov_> cr m under the highs
[0:53:31] <+Troispoint> they brought zoning back with S5 tbh
[0:53:31] <+TopTieramisu> does G have any proper story yet or is he just the crazy guy that thinks he rules the world?
[0:53:36] <Ianrazz> My teacher is doing spinning hard kicks when i arrive late on class
[0:53:36] <+YeezusPieces1> Guile tho
[0:53:39] <+tearknack> question, does woolie have a sub discord?
[0:53:45] <Clinnamon> G is a top tier youtuber, it's canon
[0:53:47] <DensityD> good advancement
[0:53:47] <@Solidus_113> no
[0:53:48] <AustinApa> all the important story is implied
[0:53:49] <dragonify_> @TopTieramisu G is a youtuber
[0:53:49] <%gatorafan> I'm pretty sure it's the later.
[0:53:50] <+mtler> @dualities i concur
[0:53:54] <Kristoffers> @TopTieramisu crazy mysterious world guy
[0:53:56] <DensityD> that's super hard to do
[0:53:56] <Aydarkzero> is Sagat Sigma?
[0:53:56] <AustinApa> for starters G is a freemason
[0:53:58] <runningfleet> @TopTieramisu gill says he feels familiar
[0:54:00] <+ggbhtg> Instead Ryu is bad Kappa
[0:54:06] <+TopTieramisu> so G is basically Ganryu LUL
[0:54:07] <+worthwhile_off> @TopTieramisu people speculate G is Gill and Urien's long lost brother and that he later on becomes Q.
[0:54:10] <jrglz90> hey woolie wie war dein tag?
[0:54:12] <+emperordread> scrub quote or hot take: Zoning is for people who don't want to actually play fighting games
[0:54:19] <%Dualities> I'm so sad I missed out on Woolie's SFIV stream. I wanna body him on Fuerte
[0:54:23] <DensityD> I'm going to keep arm chair EVO-pro'ing over here
[0:54:25] <DensityD> don't judge
[0:54:28] <+Troispoint> @emperordread what do you think
[0:54:28] <mrpandabear437> thats a scrubqoupte
[0:54:29] <AustinApa> G is the representation of God in Man
[0:54:29] <DensityD> except me Kappa
[0:54:32] <runningfleet> thats a big scrubquote
[0:54:33] <faqmachine> definitely scrub quote
[0:54:33] <+dramajoe> scrubquote
[0:54:35] <artificiallynatural> scrubquote
[0:54:38] <AustinApa> he's fullof occult and esotericreferences
[0:54:41] <%gatorafan> @emperordread, just wait your turn manesi1Velfeelsgood
[0:54:46] <@Squdnate> @emperordread Scrubquote
[0:54:46] <Jaku2011> Scrubquote
[0:54:48] <+emperordread> lol yes it was taken from scrub quotes
[0:54:52] <+emperordread> you all win
[0:54:54] <jrglz90> hey freunde kann ich mitspielen?
[0:54:55] <+TopTieramisu> that's a scrub quote. and i wouldn't be suprised if it was from plauge
[0:54:56] <+TopTieramisu> plague*
[0:54:58] <Serge_12> This is FOR FUN or FOR GLORY?
[0:55:00] <runningfleet> even if it wasnt from the accound
[0:55:06] <runningfleet> thats still a scrubquote
[0:55:17] <Guntanks_in_Space> definitely a scrubquote
[0:55:19] <AustinApa> G is looking to brainwash people to fight the illuminati
[0:55:24] <%Dualities> FOR GLORY it feels like
[0:55:26] <%lordsdb> For fun
[0:55:28] <AustinApa> its meant to be a mirror of what Qanon is
[0:55:30] <%BrooklynAIA> the confirms
[0:55:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @serge_12 FOR FUN but as usual it becomes FOR GLORY
[0:55:34] <%yeknomlive> plagues scrubquotes was about dbfz inputd
[0:55:38] <jrglz90> jetzt ne runde street fighter wäre echt mega
[0:55:38] <+emperordread> personally I don't play zoner characters, but that's just my style
[0:55:42] <+Troispoint> that's the easiest confirm in the game lol
[0:55:44] <Serge_12> ahh okay thanks lol
[0:55:47] <+Ellila> What in gods name is that Zangier skin?
[0:55:48] <Arek_1> @TopTieramisu "But I don't wanna do a quarter-circle motion." LUL
[0:55:52] <AustinApa> @worthwhile_off scroll up
[0:55:52] <+Ellila> Sagat*
[0:55:56] <spacebanditooo> FeelsBadMan
[0:55:56] <jerkhov_> For fun because nobody’s playing abigail Kappa
[0:55:58] <+TopTieramisu> i'm pretty sure plague has had several scrubquote level zingers
[0:55:59] <Louie_Salmon> Man this outfit is horny
[0:56:01] <Solidnick18> FeelsBadMan
[0:56:03] <AustinApa> read what i said
[0:56:04] <%Dualities> @emperordread Morrigan/Doom throws that scrubquote directly into the trashcan.
[0:56:04] <Fujiwara_92> 0% > 100% WIN RATIO PogChamp
[0:56:06] <+YeezusPieces1> Woolie broke this man
[0:56:07] <CozyGUNNA> BIG AAA
[0:56:08] <SomersaultJustice> you need to steal their soul to replace your first soul
[0:56:09] <Bennett_Fracture> if you ain't zoning... you ain't trying...
[0:56:09] <CozyGUNNA> ASS
[0:56:20] <+DrJamesWoods> That outfit is way too hott to be in this game
[0:56:25] <+DrJamesWoods> Sagat Makes the PP hard
[0:56:26] <jase__x> Reggie got that streak
[0:56:41] <Guntanks_in_Space> @DrJamesWoods hiding the scar makes it even more sexier
[0:56:46] <+Javaa01> @louie_salmon Basically ALL of Chunners costumes in this are horny as hell
[0:56:52] <Guntanks_in_Space> also this is Reggie's redemption after he got 5 Gs in Samurai Shodown lol
[0:56:53] <+emperordread> I like traditional footsies instead of blazeblue style stuff like making swords appear all over the stage
[0:56:58] <+TopTieramisu> some of chun's costumes are confusing
[0:56:59] <jerkhov_> This matchup is in chun’s favor but he doesn’t know the ways to get in
[0:57:00] <DensityD> is it good footsies or bad footsies? IDK but I see empty footsies....
[0:57:01] <Ianrazz> I wish Chun Li was my teacher back in the day
[0:57:02] <+emperordread> that's also why I love DiveKick so much
[0:57:02] <+DrJamesWoods> @Guntanks_in_Space Kreygasm
[0:57:09] <DensityD> when do I open my 3rd eye and see beyond?
[0:57:13] <+worthwhile_off> Yo, whaddup my Zona?
[0:57:13] <Guntanks_in_Space> macawGasm
[0:57:23] <+full_st0p> Watching this make me want to go back and play SF4
[0:57:44] <DensityD> lets play Street Fighter Series X
[0:57:46] <+DrJamesWoods> Watching this makes me wanna open Sagat's third eye
[0:58:02] <DensityD> that's a better naming convention, right guys?
[0:58:04] <+dramajoe> shimmy
[0:58:08] <%Dualities> I super wanna run SFIV sets.
[0:58:08] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:58:09] <+Troispoint> Jimmy doing the wrong juggles
[0:58:18] <NotHereToStream> couldn't kara cancel
[0:58:21] <DensityD> Juggles doing the wrong Jimmy
[0:58:25] <@Menitta> @dualities you missed it boi
[0:58:30] <%Dualities> I AM AWARE
[0:58:37] <+Troispoint> he could tiger knee reliably instead
[0:58:52] <@Menitta> you wanna play 4 later?
[0:58:57] <%Dualities> Absolutely
[0:59:03] <+Troispoint> the optimal stuff for Sagat is annoying to pull off consistently
[0:59:04] <Ognjenco> Give us Cyberbots 2 CAPCOM! dnoplsGREEN
[0:59:09] <@Menitta> let's go post stream
[0:59:10] <%Dualities> or 5, or 3S. I just wanna play a street fighter dude.
[0:59:26] <uncledoodsauce> where's ja?
[0:59:34] <Fujiwara_92> dang
[0:59:35] <%Dualities> I'd *really* love to play MvC2 but apparently that's impossible outside of PS3/360
[0:59:35] <AustinApa> i'll play you in 5 @dualities
[0:59:36] <+TopTieramisu> YAS
[0:59:41] <+dramajoe> st lk ftw
[0:59:44] <+Troispoint> you can also juggle VT 1 into itself if it's for the kill
[0:59:49] <+Azero_Tehiro> Yas king, slay!
[1:00:02] <jerkhov_> Is that Ray Charles in the back
[1:00:07] <Bennett_Fracture> the one in 21 - 1...
[1:00:11] <%CaptainPileDriver> man, that tire is super great for big damage with abigail
[1:00:29] <DensityD> what's the fight stick cleaning/sanitization routine?
[1:00:43] <+dramajoe> reggies dp punishes LUL
[1:00:44] <+razielhex> using their tongues
[1:00:44] <DensityD> what if I have christmas cookie crumbs on it?
[1:00:48] <Guntanks_in_Space> Sanitary Wipes for me, or something with isopropyl alcohol
[1:01:00] <+worthwhile_off> @Guntanks_in_Space likewise
[1:01:01] <Guntanks_in_Space> if you have a blower or an air can take that to your arcade stick too lol
[1:01:10] <jerkhov_> Easier than keyboard cleaning by a lot
[1:01:12] <+razielhex> just bought an electric vacuum/blower
[1:01:32] <Guntanks_in_Space> i actually have an electric blower that i use for my PC, i sometimes put my stick on that shit lol
[1:01:42] <+TopTieramisu> glad they added fahkumram to sfv :)
[1:01:44] <TheNewJapanGuy> Howdy
[1:01:48] <+razielhex> shit's loud but goddamn does it work
[1:01:58] <Guntanks_in_Space> what the fahk @TopTieramisu :)
[1:02:00] <zayasu> HahaCat HahaCat HahaCat
[1:02:16] <DensityD> @WoolieVersus Happy Boxing Day! Joyeux lendemain de Noël!
[1:02:17] <jerkhov_> I want to fahkumram secretary chun
[1:02:19] <Guntanks_in_Space> but wait, does Sagat have a family to protecc
[1:02:24] <DensityD> HahaGingercat HahaGingercat HahaGingercat
[1:02:28] <Guntanks_in_Space> i mean there's the orphans and his pet tiger...
[1:02:30] <Clinnamon> who else is gonna take care of the tiger
[1:02:35] <%Dualities> He fights for his entire nation
[1:02:36] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Is it easier to play fighting games with an arcade stick or controller?
[1:02:38] <SomersaultJustice> JAGGLE
[1:02:44] <DensityD> this way?
[1:02:58] <%ChoculaUltra> @BallerSwagBro9k its preference, really.
[1:02:58] <jerkhov_> @ballerswagbro9k personal preferences no real answer
[1:03:00] <Clinnamon> he's always complaining about his tiger's knee, someone needs to get the cat to a vet
[1:03:01] <+dramajoe> you tryin to fireball war, with a king
[1:03:04] <%Dualities> @BallerSwagBro9k it SUPER depends on the game and how you hold controllers
[1:03:07] <civet10> @ballerswagbro9k its mostly preference
[1:03:10] <Arek_1> @DensityD If your lever on your arcade stick has a shaft cover and two dust washers (one outside, one inside), nothing should get inside your stick.
[1:03:10] <Fujiwara_92> dang gg my bro

[1:03:26] <+TopTieramisu> tezuka zone
[1:03:26] <%yeknomlive> @ballerswagbro9k some things are easier on either. honestly tho arcade sticks wont make you automatically better
[1:03:28] <%Dualities> I enjoy arcade sticks so much I'll play Wipeout on one
[1:03:31] <Solidnick18> oh no
[1:03:35] <jerkhov_> Don’t let me into my zome
[1:03:38] <Guntanks_in_Space> @BallerSwagBro9k whichever you're more comfortable with tbh. whichever controller that lets you play long sets without your hands cramping up is the best
[1:03:40] <@Squdnate> Full Kayne Westin' it
[1:03:43] <shryoc> The zone zone LOL
[1:03:45] <Ianrazz> @BallerSwagBro9k For me it depends on the game, MK11 is easier for pad and SFV is a must on arcade stick for me
[1:03:55] <Bennett_Fracture> that was ytv the zone...
[1:03:58] <Kyopheonix> It cant be the Zone Zone.....not enough tentacles xD
[1:04:00] <$SilverRoddo> Get in the zone, AUTO-ZONE.

[1:06:54] <NotHereToStream> guile you have an AR on your back, it probably do more dmg then your boom Kappa
[1:06:57] <DensityD> HIGH NOISES
[1:06:58] <jerkhov_> Tower of Babel?
[1:07:04] <+razielhex> BACKBREKKA
[1:07:05] <Clinnamon> I think blanka's nergi costume came out before they rajang to world, so nergi was the better promotion for MH
[1:07:23] <DensityD> excuse you, it is Street Fighter, not Street Gun Fighter
[1:07:30] <Guntanks_in_Space> look man
[1:07:34] <+DoctorDerp388> always be flashin

[1:09:49] <fist_wizard_jay> Honestly, I know Nergigante was the flagship monster for MHW and all, but this outfit for Blanka should have been Rajang
[1:09:58] <Fujiwara_92> Woolie here training to beat daigo's guile LUL
[1:10:08] <DensityD> this is guile bringing his full sleep/ paralysis armor set, and bully Nergigante with rocks and toads

[1:14:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> karin and rashid are the two characters that i hate playing against, but karin is just boring to watch.
[1:14:33] <Solidnick18> the world president
[1:14:34] <adamisfruit> Karin is just a super ResidentSleeper
[1:14:35] <+mighty_max_t> It also gives armor, I think?
[1:14:42] <DensityD> PJSalt
[1:14:42] <civet10> also vives you damage reduction

[1:14:57] <DensityD> any PJSalt that E. Honda has is honorable salt
[1:15:04] <mzrx7> @mighty_max_t nah, 10% defense buff that stack per v-skill activation up to 3
[1:15:07] <%yeknomlive> that'll do pig
[1:15:12] <Arek_1> Damage and stun reduction. 10%, 20%, and up to 30%.
[1:15:15] <mzrx7> but you lose it on knockdown
[1:15:19] <BabyNaBackbrace> G. looks like a werewolf on an English Fox hunt
[1:15:21] <+worthwhile_off> It's funny how pre-release everyone was hype for Karin and now they just hate her guts.

[1:18:47] <adamisfruit> G’s second V skill has multiple mechanics. It prevents loss of Presidency for one knockdown, and each “taunt” gives a 10% defense buff for a total of 30%. The same as Q’s taunts

[1:21:48] <+knowyourenemy_97> hmmmm
[1:21:50] <baronblank> man, I am looking forward a lot to sf6, cause there are a lot of characters in this game I wanna play, but I don't really wanna play sf5
[1:21:53] <333agus333> YOOOOOOOOOO
[1:21:55] <Solidnick18> PogChamp
[1:21:59] <+Tydemore> check moi ce crew de scrubs
[1:22:03] <Kalinflip> Who dat?
[1:22:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> MASH THOSE BUTTONS WOOLIE
[1:22:12] <dragonify_> Stand!!
[1:22:13] <Personified134> wait the nero costume has THE STAND????
[1:22:14] <%Irridium> alright that nero costume is pretty good
[1:22:22] <Kalinflip> atpCap
[1:22:22] <DensityD> 6th dimensional dempsey ROOLLLLLLLLLLLL
[1:22:24] <Kyopheonix> hey just getting into reading frame data for fighting games, (Tekken 7 in my case) Anyone (couch or chat) have any pointers or advice that would help?
[1:22:26] <Personified134> guys do I have to buy sf5 now
[1:22:35] <%yeknomlive> btw cody gets vergil
[1:22:53] <+GalacticaPhanto> just wait until championship edition
[1:22:54] <dragonify_> And Ken gets Dante
[1:22:54] <Zerud> and who's dante?
[1:22:56] <Smileyhat> baronblank Problem with that is SF6 will undoubtedly start with a smaller roster. So unless the characters you want to play are like Ryu or Ken there's a decent chance they won't be there.
[1:23:12] <DensityD> who was ED's favorite muppet from Sesame Street?
[1:23:14] <Smileyhat> I missed the @ because I'm dumb.
[1:23:16] <SuckPuppet> too bad they used the worst Lady costume in this game
[1:23:18] <DensityD> 123 the count 123
[1:23:18] <%yeknomlive> ken dante cause of course rueben voices both
[1:23:21] <+KgKid51> oof
[1:23:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Smileyhat if they bring back literally any grappler i'm pretty much good for myself personally
[1:23:28] <Graxe_> As broken as it was, I do miss the Blanka time stop bug
[1:23:29] <+RenoDeGeneric> @Kyopheonix remember, negative doesn't mean bad. Punishable is bad, but even then good moves can be punishable.
[1:23:31] <+razielhex> 1991 baby
[1:23:33] <+PeopleOfTheLand> But you aren't walking like Menat!
[1:23:38] <@Menitta> Ed is fuckin weird man
[1:23:55] <+JakeSG> @Kyopheonix if you see a move in tekken that's -9 or less than it's safe. and a move that's -15 is launch punishable which is a big deal
[1:24:04] <DensityD> fuckin man is weird Ed
[1:24:04] <wyanwunt> hey woolie you still have a link to the super best friend podcast on your twitch. plz remove i still hurts :(
[1:24:19] <+razielhex> Weird, Ed is fukken man
[1:24:23] <%Hacerous> dis man..
[1:24:25] <Smileyhat> @CaptainPileDriver Well, you're probably good there. Gief is almost as essential as Ryu or Ken to a base SF roster, at least in my eyes.
[1:24:29] <+knowyourenemy_97> Ed is pretty tight
[1:24:30] <+BurkeBigsby> actin like you aint getting command grabbed atpCarl
[1:24:31] <DensityD> BibleThump it still hurts
[1:24:32] <Kalinflip> @Kyopheonix Movement is Just as important as frames , Even with strong pressure tools you should still know how to out maneuver your opponent
[1:24:57] <+KgKid51> fight me!
[1:24:58] <TheactualDiepod> jimmy bones is always so pleased with himself
[1:25:08] <+Troispoint> Ed has mad ''spoiled child crying at the mall for the video game he wants'' energy
[1:25:13] <dawnks> who does woolie play in this
[1:25:18] <Smileyhat> My favorite characters in this game have been Kolin and Lucia. Probably neither of them making it into SF6.
[1:25:25] <DensityD> Edergy
[1:25:27] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Smileyhat yeah but i hate gief in this game cause fuck getting in with him is such a pain in the ass, like, i legit miss green hand, give me t-hawk or hugo or hakon, give me a grappler with more options than gief in this game
[1:25:34] <+razielhex> damn yooooooooooooouuuuuuuuuuuu
[1:25:36] <Kalinflip> @Kyopheonix What chars do you main
[1:25:45] <DensityD> Damn your fight money
[1:25:49] <+PeopleOfTheLand> Hooooorrrryyyy sheeeeet!
[1:25:58] <%Hacerous> LMAO
[1:25:59] <%Hacerous> reggie
[1:26:03] <Clinnamon> I could see kolin making it to SF6 if it goes more into SF3/Illuminati timeline. And she has a kinda unique style in SF

[1:27:11] <TheNewJapanGuy> Do millennials even know what a Linkin Park is?

[1:27:38] <+razielhex> millenials are in their 30s. Goddamned Meteoria was dropped in 2003, 16 years ago. @TheNewJapanGuy
[1:27:38] <333agus333> @TheNewJapanGuy you're thinking of zoomers
[1:27:41] <+GalacticaPhanto> I had to switch to Abigail because it was the natural choice instead of Birdie for me
[1:27:43] <+violet_city> of course millennials know what linkin park is that was literally part of their generation
[1:27:49] <333agus333> @DensityD water
[1:27:49] <%CaptainPileDriver> @TheNewJapanGuy they do since millenials were the ones born in the 80's and 90's and anyone from 1997 i think and later is a gen x

[1:28:52] <Kalinflip> @Kyopheonix Ahh I got you So you already know that back 3 , standing 4, ff 2 down back 4 are all pretty good oppressive moves

[1:41:04] <TheArrow_> BOOM is how you start the fight
[1:41:05] <+BurkeBigsby> Japan probably though it sounded cool
[1:41:07] <SomersaultJustice> wubba wybba
[1:41:09] <+Troispoint> Laura is a dumb thot that's why
[1:41:09] <SuckPuppet> the ass shake is how you finish it
[1:41:11] <+Deko_> cause she is not native
[1:41:12] <Solidnick18> don't worry about it
[1:41:12] <+eanscrale> It's a very literal translation
[1:41:14] <+trippersigs22> fuckoff woolz Laura is a queen
[1:41:14] <Fujiwara_92> she's acting like a real brazilian speaking English @woolieversus
[1:41:15] <+razielhex> translation vs. localization @WoolieVersus

[1:41:42] <%Dualities> She's all about presentation not her content
[1:41:44] <+TheBitingIrish> Having a nice rack and ass doesn't exempt her from using improper grammar
[1:41:49] <Wooliam> Laura rubbing her ass is the way that she starts the fight quickly

[1:44:25] <supahrob64> THE VFX WutFace
[1:44:26] <zayasu> why this costume WutFace
[1:44:26] <hamahiroyuki> gill, or as I like to call him: tododroki pillar man
[1:44:27] <Dao_Puppy> Kind of hope woolie invests in a compressor at some point....
[1:44:29] <Magicferret> The worse costume in street fighter right here
[1:44:35] <P0wderedT0astMan> and you thought the Nero costume was to distracting.....
[1:44:43] <@Squdnate> who dis horny looking fella

[1:44:45] <Nekros4442> God....I love watching Arturo's offensive as fuck Dhalsim
[1:44:47] <Wooliam> Yo we doing Darkstalkers again?!
[1:44:47] <Nekros4442> It's amazinfg
[1:44:49] <Smileyhat> I'll come in with my main but I'm bad at the game anyway.
[1:44:51] <adamisfruit> Pyron costume is best
[1:44:54] <Macfine> its a little busy...
[1:44:57] <floralkami> isn't Dhalsim dead?
[1:45:02] <guymontag0> There are worse looking costumes, but Gill’s Putin is easily the worst in a competitive setting
[1:45:02] <Smileyhat> That Pyron costume is the coolest shit
[1:45:06] <Kalinflip> he right there @floralkami wym
[1:45:07] <Blackscience91> First time i ever got a game. Was fun but super nervous.
[1:45:07] <P0wderedT0astMan> A LITTLE?????
[1:45:08] <Kalinflip> Kappa
[1:45:08] <guymontag0> @floralkami no
[1:45:15] <SuckPuppet> how can you see what he's doing
[1:45:16] <spawnzie> Was about to say he looks like cinder
[1:45:17] <+KgKid51> Gill theme Kreygasm
[1:45:20] <+Qsmash_> but that's just Pyron. He always looks like that
[1:45:21] <+mighty_max_t> This theme RULES
[1:45:23] <runningfleet> he is also like KI in that its hard on my eyes
[1:45:23] <P0wderedT0astMan> He might as well turn into a Lazershow
[1:45:30] <Kalinflip> I like the trailer theme more
[1:45:31] <Saltmeisterr> SourPls
[1:45:33] <DensityD> is this colorblind mode compliant?
[1:45:36] <Kalinflip> Oh wait this is the trailer theme
[1:45:47] <SomersaultJustice> I like this theme but I wish his new gen theme was in too
[1:45:59] <adamisfruit> peppeJAMMER
[1:46:00] <Arek_1> Kinda weird that Gill didn't get his robes as a costume.
[1:46:19] <P0wderedT0astMan> he has a toga
[1:46:19] <floralkami> @arek_1 pretty sure he does
[1:46:21] <guymontag0> @arek_1 Urien has it for his Gill costume
[1:46:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> v-skill 1
[1:46:28] <%CaptainPileDriver> wait
[1:46:31] <Dao_Puppy> Wait, did he rant about choosing the new shit and then get VS1?
[1:46:31] <runningfleet> ex moves
[1:46:32] <%CaptainPileDriver> i mean v-trigger 2
[1:46:32] <floralkami> oh
[1:46:33] <%mzrx7> v-trigger dependants
[1:46:34] <%ChoculaUltra> I think the robes are his story costume unlock, no?
[1:46:34] <SuckPuppet> is Sethany in the game yet?
[1:46:34] <@Squdnate> Does Gill still has his diapers as a costume?
[1:46:36] <%mzrx7> dependant*
[1:46:38] <%CaptainPileDriver> v-trigger 1
[1:46:40] <DensityD> Animal House Toga Toga Toga Toga
[1:46:41] <$BSplitz> its trigger
[1:46:45] <Arek_1> Yeah, toga. Not robes. Yeah, Urien got the robes.
[1:46:45] <JINcredible1> his VS changes based on the trigger
[1:46:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> each v-trigger is a different

[1:49:23] <Kyopheonix> not*
[1:49:25] <+knowyourenemy_97> sad
[1:49:29] <%jinking79> fuck no that shit would be fair
[1:49:30] <+spiegspikel> R Kelly; Age is just a number
[1:49:30] <+YeezusPieces1> Gill has ressurction in the 3 arcade mode
[1:49:31] <zayasu> poison Kreygasm
[1:49:31] <KaironFortressKnight> get a good ed or alex in there
[1:49:32] <DensityD> woolie talk activate!
[1:49:33] <@Menitta> It'd be fair if Gill had like 1/3 of his life and full everything
[1:49:34] <TheArrow_> costs five bars
[1:49:38] <+Qsmash_> so Dark Phoenix
[1:49:40] <ChrisM341> @lordsdb Well apparently he has a thing for the latter Kappa
[1:49:41] <Wooliam> Didn't they do something like resurrection with Terminator in MK11?
[1:49:42] <+Qsmash_> aka not balanced
[1:49:44] <floralkami> Gil is still shit
[1:49:44] <Nekros4442> Well. Didnt Jason have a ressurection mechanic in MKX that was fair?
[1:49:45] <CuteChallenger> gill has rez in the sf3 arcade path
[1:49:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus that would be broke af
[1:49:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> you know it would be
[1:49:52] <Div_the_Penguin> he has ressurection in arcade mode
[1:49:53] <Superbro64> resurrection is fair ONLY if the other player gets some buff too, in my opinion @WoolieVersus
[1:49:53] <The_Boulder8> Ravens can get to 2.6ft long
[1:49:54] <guymontag0> Remember when Elena had Healing as her second ultra and everyone hated it
[1:50:01] <floralkami> story wise
[1:50:05] <MasterCosmic> After Resurrection, can no longer gain V Meter and CA.

[2:02:13] <P0wderedT0astMan> @burkebigsby Vanilla or the other one?
[2:02:15] <WhiskeyRB> underpass was good
[2:02:15] <%CaptainPileDriver> depends
[2:02:17] <+Ryu_R> thats not even a question wtf?
[2:02:18] <%Dualities> English voiced El Fuerte was so great
[2:02:20] <Clinnamon> 5 has some great songs
[2:02:21] <Heefnoff> I need to get some Alex going kbradPOINT
[2:02:21] <%CaptainPileDriver> 4 and 5 have some good and bad music
[2:02:22] <%Irridium> V has a lot of problems but the ost isn't it
[2:02:23] <zayasu> 4 easily
[2:02:23] <+BurkeBigsby> Papa Neir
[2:02:23] <%yeknomlive> 5 has some great songs
[2:02:23] <KaironFortressKnight> I vote 5
[2:02:24] <Arek_1> V, but IV had some nice ones.
[2:02:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's equal imo
[2:02:28] <@Menitta> I say 5
[2:02:30] <+KgKid51> probably 5
[2:02:31] <JINcredible1> 5 has everything and its better
[2:02:34] <Idon__> They butchered Juri's themes but overall, V OST is godlike.
[2:02:35] <%Dualities> V has a lot more elevator music than 4
[2:02:39] <Fujiwara_92> ibuki PogChamp
[2:02:41] <%gatorafan> V > IV
[2:02:42] <%jinking79> Juri SFV song is the Worst
[2:02:42] <+Ryu_R> SF4 has Indestructable and Turn the Beat Back
[2:02:44] <@Menitta> 5 has DMC music so it clearly wins Kappa
[2:02:46] <maximumoverjew> African Airfield is the best IV stage song next to Volcanic Rim
[2:02:51] <+KgKid51> have you heard the arcade themes hggBanger
[2:02:51] <ChrisM341> G has the best theme in V
[2:02:54] <%yeknomlive> 5 has rashidooooooo
[2:02:59] <+razielhex> y'all see that 3rd Strike Ibuki just completely trash that Urien last week?
[2:03:01] <giogio346> sf4 had sakuras theme
[2:03:02] <@Squdnate> 2, nothing beats og guile theme
[2:03:04] <+YeezusPieces1> Zeku theme
[2:03:09] <dmysta3000> Zeku's theme is fuking great
[2:03:18] <microwheel> is that tracksuit lacoste
[2:03:26] <Smileyhat> Second time I've almost got a match but got denied. Why you gotta do me like this?
[2:03:27] <@Menitta> Man I was so disappointed in Ibuki in 5
[2:03:28] <Arek_1> I'll never forgive Capcom for changing Akuma and Gouken's theme in SSFIV onwards to remixes of Ryu's theme...
[2:03:28] <+BurkeBigsby> Gormless Ibuki
[2:03:37] <%sleepy_coffee> sleepy_coffee gifted a Tier 1 sub to AngriestPat! This is their first Gift Sub in the channel! 
[2:03:38] <%sleepy_coffee> sleepy_coffee's Gift shared rewards to 5 others in Chat! 
[2:03:41] <ryuguitarfreak> Indistructible is unbelievably impossible hard garbage
[2:03:42] <%CaptainPileDriver> 5 also has karin's theme, which, whatever for the character, her theme is good
[2:03:43] <+TopTieramisu> the ibuki jumpsuit works well
[2:03:47] <+Rabbitmage> Me in the back
[2:03:49] <SomersaultJustice> caltrops
[2:03:53] <+razielhex> @sleepy_coffee you gifted Pat a sub?

[2:39:28] <%CaptainPileDriver> v-skill 2 got me back in
[2:39:30] <Arek_1> @Dao_Puppy Yes, Zangief's Double Lariat has projectile invincibility on frames 1-41.
[2:39:31] <Superbro64> to be fair, someone shouldn't let your opinion of the game effect their joy. What you like purely based on the internet personalities you watch is wack
[2:39:32] <TaylorTot> i mean this game to me is a massive downgrade from 4 so i cant blame you woolie

[2:40:28] <Ultimatefool> Honestly yall SF6 needs to be some hype shit to get me back in
[2:40:32] <%Itselguapo> Tell Max to play this shit because he's a coward and won' t play it!
[2:40:47] <Arek_1> @Dao_Puppy Most likely.
[2:40:49] <Guntanks_in_Space> @Superbro64 true lol. then again, i'm the jackass who willingly plays actual kusoge as much as my friend keeps on egging me on how dead my games are
[2:40:56] <DensityD> who's more cute? Kirby or the pokemon Falinks?
[2:41:00] <neet98> SF6 femSeth in starting roster
[2:41:06] <Guntanks_in_Space> it's discouraging, but yeah don't let shit like that discourage anyone from playing whichever FG you want
[2:41:10] <zayasu> try that on my walking cat
[2:41:11] <SomersaultJustice> what about a falinks made of kirbys?
[2:41:15] <+ggbhtg> @itselguapo uuuuh do you KNOW how many times he played Fight of Gods?
[2:41:20] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> SF6 will have battle royale
[2:41:27] <Superbro64> @Guntanks_in_Space I'm with Max. Play what you want, because you want to play it.
[2:41:29] <%Itselguapo> @DensityD Kirby after inhaling a falinks for it's power
[2:41:30] <Superbro64> End of story
[2:41:30] <+TopTieramisu> SF6 in the RE engine atpRtsd
[2:41:35] <Mr_216> atpRtsd3 atpRtsd4
[2:41:37] <DensityD> mouse wheel up: melee. I'm getting physically ill over here
[2:41:39] <DensityD> DansGame
[2:41:40] <+dramajoe> no. we must bully everyone who likes sfv. turn them into jump force mains
[2:41:46] <SomersaultJustice> doodShine
[2:41:53] <Fujiwara_92> leaked sf6 will be called sf for girls and no male character will be in it Kappa
[2:41:55] <%CaptainPileDriver> sf6 legit better have hakan
[2:41:58] <DensityD> good pick @Itselguapo
[2:42:07] <%CaptainPileDriver> either that or a new grappler that's fun
[2:42:11] <neet98> RE engine is prob not good for fighting game
[2:42:21] <Guntanks_in_Space> no wait
[2:42:23] <+TopTieramisu> but kof for girls is bait for girls
[2:42:23] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> SF6 will be shotos only
[2:42:25] <Superbro64> enough about sfv, WHOS EXCITED for GOKU in season 3 of dbfz though?
[2:42:28] <SuckPuppet> what if SF6 isn't a fighting game
[2:42:29] <+TopTieramisu> if anything, sf6 for girls will be all dudes
[2:42:34] <+ggbhtg> @neet98 why?
[2:42:35] <Guntanks_in_Space> they were able to retool the RE engine to work in DMC5, it's possible they can work an FG in that
[2:42:37] <uncledoodsauce> I thought ja rule and billy were going to show up today?
[2:42:37] <%Itselguapo> oops all shoto shotas
[2:42:39] <%drefizz> SF Heroines
[2:42:47] <Guntanks_in_Space> but it will be expensive to make with its reliance on scanning models
[2:42:50] <%drefizz> thats a good lucio cosplay
[2:42:56] <Fujiwara_92> sf6 will only have sf1 ryu and ken with the same move set Kappa
[2:42:57] <%Puhff> Street Fighter 6: Everyone is Gay
[2:42:59] <+dramajoe> sfvi is a battle royale
[2:43:00] <chronoxgp> sf6 will just be a cable that hooks into the back of your neck and you play in VR
[2:43:05] <neet98> @ggbhtg it's realistic so no color
[2:43:17] <DensityD> did the art commission to Ed Mcmillan for Woolie portrait in Legend of Bumbo style go through yet?
[2:43:22] <+ggbhtg> @neet98 DMC 5?
[2:43:24] <Guntanks_in_Space> okay SF6 is just Striking Vipers
[2:43:26] <pillowwasp> Street fighter 6 is an anime arena fighter
[2:43:38] <Superbro64> look at the bright side, sfv fans, we'll get anime sfv coming next year, with grandblue Kappa
[2:43:43] <Fujiwara_92> next sf game will be a tactical rpg Kappa
[2:43:43] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1210124488463077376
[2:43:45] <+TopTieramisu> sf6 will be a BR that plays like survival mode with human opponents
[2:43:49] <neet98> @ggbhtg they have to dim Dante and Vergil jackets
[2:44:08] <Superbro64> harada is looking into seeing if X Zone 3 will be a thing
[2:44:10] <%hkarim94> damn this Gerudo Valley goes
[2:44:28] <+TopTieramisu> where's the collage of awful DBZ shirts?
[2:44:29] <SomersaultJustice> I'd be into a raid boss battle where everyone teams up to fight one super powered guy
[2:44:33] <+ggbhtg> X Zone 3, OH. JOY.
[2:44:40] <DensityD> so like salt mines from Thems fighting herds?
[2:44:41] <+dramajoe> why cant harada get john madden as the next dlc character

[2:47:30] <%Ecchigun> salut les gars, merry xmas
[2:47:31] <Superbro64> I agree

[2:47:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus does that mean reggie evolved from foot fetish to fisting fetish?
[2:47:58] <Jaku2011> 1 frame links are dumb
[2:48:00] <neet98> but KOF 13 look amazing
[2:48:03] <Superbro64> I was more on the lines of creativity, other than execution, but sure @WoolieVersus

[2:48:30] <%Wool> Reggie's favorite food is french fries because it has potatoes and tomatoes
[2:48:32] <%CaptainPileDriver> remember this lore
[2:48:37] <+ggbhtg> But Electrics MATTER SO MUCH IN TEKKEN right? Kappa
[2:48:47] <DensityD> a floor bounce or a wall bounce?
[2:48:51] <+emperordread> anything at the end of a limb basically. Fist, feet, it's all good
[2:48:53] <SomersaultJustice> SF6 is F2P
[2:49:02] <Solidnick18> as long as they take their time on it
[2:49:09] <%Irridium> SF6 honestly should be F2P
[2:49:13] <Fujiwara_92> sf6 will be a anime fighter, with air dashes and shit

[3:17:57] <%Wool> Fox is actually bottom tier. Everything is unsafe
[3:17:58] <%mzrx7> @KalmVibrations when did the game get updated btw? probably got auto-updated and i cleared queue.

[3:18:21] <+RelaxedPizza> @ggbhtg All frogs are now D tier
[3:18:22] <ae_moth> seeing Might Fox's animations reminds me of Darkseid's, where he always kept his hands behind his back
[3:18:34] <%mzrx7> cool thanks
[3:18:42] <+ggbhtg> scissor kick NIGHTMAREEEEE
[3:18:45] <DensityD> I wish it said Biff and Baff and Wack and Don as well as Pow!
[3:18:50] <DensityD> but for now it's all just POW!
[3:19:01] <+Pookiedaexzile> Double it up
[3:19:12] <faqmachine> what's the closest analogue to this game gameplay-wise?
[3:19:12] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:19:12] <ae_moth> it's a really minor nitpick, but it's sort of the same trap of "hands don't move, so motions look more strained and awkward"
[3:19:18] <DensityD> what the fox say?
[3:19:20] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> New Evo Main Stage game?
[3:19:20] <DensityD> say my name
[3:19:23] <%mzrx7> @faqmachine fight of gods Kappa
[3:19:41] <KalmVibrations> The fox and the squirrel are the two top tiers now iirc, now that Fox's legs have a better hitbox and squirrel's loop and projectile game got improved
[3:19:45] <TheNewChallenger> @ATRodger 3 attack, one skill button
[3:19:56] <%ATRodger> cool
[3:20:05] <DensityD> is this mexican health values or canadian damage values?
[3:20:05] <deafmelone> I think fox is like that cuz its funny
[3:20:07] <+Pookiedaexzile> Fox use you're range
[3:20:16] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> HOOOO!?! You approach me!? FOX!?!
[3:20:34] <%SuttonsGaming> i cant beat the shit out of you without getting closer
[3:20:48] <ae_moth> like i said it's a minor nitpick among a clearly fun and cheeky game

[3:26:26] <Superbro64> these canadian resets
[3:26:44] <%Wool> Fox is bottom tier because literally everything is unsafe except for his lights
[3:26:46] <cartoonmuppet> Double Toasted brought me here! They were hosting this stream.
[3:26:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> yeah, if there was a grappler i'd be super in
[3:26:49] <fluke_LKZ> There's no throws because the devs explained it would cost too much to put the animations in, at the time
[3:26:51] <@Squdnate> @CaptainPileDriver It's so much better than it has any right to be. And it has good rollback GGPO (Not KI tier, but still good)
[3:26:57] <+Pookiedaexzile> I have a grappler concept: Anacoda with nothing but command grabs
[3:27:01] <DensityD> Woolie, THAT'S the weirdest thing about the game?

[3:40:32] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Guntanks_in_Space
[3:40:33] <DensityD> will he ever use it?

[3:41:14] <Fujiwara_92> Reggie will NEVER use that meter
[3:41:25] <Guntanks_in_Space> this should indeed be simple enough to pick up and play

[3:58:45] <Guntanks_in_Space> @WoolieVersus so how does the netplay feel mang
[3:58:55] <DensityD> I'm a casual scrub, and I think Hadoken is more iconic
[3:59:05] <%CasualDrunk> CasualDrunk subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[3:59:09] <KSDM> ono doesn't ask people to haduoken though
[3:59:16] <%Odin_777> came for Street Fighter stayed for FIGHT OF ANIMALS
[3:59:23] <Guntanks_in_Space> GOOD
[3:59:26] <DensityD> Hype of Animals for Twitch Prime sub
[3:59:27] <Guntanks_in_Space> that is what i wanted to know
[3:59:29] <DensityD> sub hype
[3:59:31] <civet10> before i even knew who ryu was, i knew what hadouken was
[3:59:40] <+ggbhtg> FEEEELS GOOD....SOUNDS GOOOOD

[4:00:06] <%Wool> 5H* omfg
[4:00:27] <beatie_g> nah it's be worse
[4:00:29] <oceanmatt> def worse
[4:00:30] <artificiallynatural> worse
[4:00:33] <Guntanks_in_Space> worse
[4:00:34] <+Deko_> they are based on meme animals so its worse
[4:00:34] <%mzrx7> worse free
[4:00:34] <DensityD> worse, as a fighting game
[4:00:34] <artcellrox> worse
[4:00:34] <Fujiwara_92> worst
[4:00:36] <%croxeye> worse, cuz memes tho
[4:00:36] <+Jintais3rd> WORSE
[4:00:37] <StormKingLD> worse
[4:00:39] <%Wool> there is probably a fighting game with actual animals
[4:00:39] <+Pookiedaexzile> Yo, who makes this, this is one Texture overlay from being onstage
[4:00:39] <Fujiwara_92> worse
[4:00:40] <DensityD> better, as a joke game
[4:00:42] <+ggbhtg> Super unbalanced @woolieversus
[4:00:42] <Superbro64> sounds beyond the scope of a 5 buck game
[4:00:42] <%Irridium> worse which would make it better
[4:00:45] <xaekin> it's possible to burst out of your opponent's burst in this game. It's ridiculous and I love it
[4:00:46] <+Pookiedaexzile> at EVO
[4:00:50] <@Menitta> What was that video with Keits that talked about GGPO?
[4:00:54] <Superbro64> this is also a joke game based on meme images
[4:00:58] <cheesedburgers> This would be worse without the memes
[4:01:03] <DensityD> Woolie, what you are describing is Tokyo Zoo
[4:01:04] <implied_consent> Woolz
[4:01:04] <mihokspawn> The cat and fox would be a horror show then
[4:01:06] <artificiallynatural> the hold back to block documentary about KI
[4:01:11] <%croxeye> it's a thailand studio IIRC
[4:01:15] <@Menitta> @artificiallynatural Thanks

[4:03:51] <Fujiwara_92> the fgc
[4:03:53] <DensityD> you are looking at Power Hook Dog and Walking Cat fight in Christmas costumes

[4:03:55] <neet98> sf5
[4:04:05] <razorgem> this needs to be at EVO

[4:05:21] <DensityD> everybody, everybody, everybody wants to be a cat
[4:05:21] <Mendin> This cat had his loops
[4:05:22] <Guntanks_in_Space> i think adding rollback there was practice for getting rollback in this game lol
[4:05:26] <fatally_furious> @superbro64 its still a meme game that we will forget until Kusoge night
[4:05:30] <DensityD> Loops Haägen-Dazs

[4:06:23] <Superbro64> @fatally_furious max stans fight crab tho Kappa
[4:06:24] <%croxeye> @MechaBaphomet it's rollback and looking great
[4:06:26] <Mendin> Fight of Gods and Fight of Dogs
[4:06:27] <Charles445> the future of unicycle tech
[4:06:30] <Guntanks_in_Space> IT HAS ROLLBACK NOW
[4:06:31] <%Wool> we can probably hop back on since it doesn't seem like that many people are playing @TheBesteban
[4:06:37] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus BOTH DO
[4:06:43] <+ez_eight> is 2p m. bison
[4:06:46] <Guntanks_in_Space> @WoolieVersus both this and Fight of Gods have rollback now
[4:06:48] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus BOTH got it
[4:06:52] <Guntanks_in_Space> like holy shit HOW
[4:06:53] <xaekin> can we make the penguin playable
[4:06:57] <Guntanks_in_Space> how come THEY GET IT
[4:07:07] <DensityD> PJSalt
[4:07:11] <DensityD> PJSugar
[4:07:20] <Fujiwara_92> ggpo is free to use, right?
[4:07:23] <%croxeye> yes
[4:07:24] <+ez_eight> wtf this game looks legit
[4:07:27] <+ggbhtg> cuz GGPO is free now and they aren't a japan studio
[4:07:28] <%Wool> BRUH WHAT IS THIS SPECTATOR SYSTEM
[4:07:28] <cumurasame> how is this game so legit
[4:07:29] <%croxeye> MIT free license now
[4:07:44] <Charles445> now they gotta sell a service "we will put ggpo in your game look we did it with ours"
[4:07:49] <Mendin> Give me an opossum and I'm sold
[4:07:49] <Superbro64> ggpo is free to use, but not easy to implement
[4:07:54] <Guntanks_in_Space> ^
[4:08:03] <+ggbhtg> PINGU GUEST FIGHTER les go @woolieversus
[4:08:03] <mihokspawn> Penguin is subzero
[4:08:07] <Superbro64> but to be fair, ANY online infrastructure is
[4:08:08] <Guntanks_in_Space> basically it's "the game has to be designed with this netcode in mind"
[4:08:12] <Superbro64> keep that in mind
[4:08:15] <Fujiwara_92> is it not easy to implement tho?
[4:08:18] <Guntanks_in_Space> and it's not as easy to implement as it sounds
[4:08:22] <DensityD> you can't have "just a penguin" DLC. the theme is a funny forced perspective animal meme picture
[4:08:24] <Mendin> Penguin is Hakan without having to oil up
[4:08:24] <Fujiwara_92> I mean, look
[4:08:25] <xaekin> to paraphrase KI's dev, netcode is hard no matter what
[4:08:25] <Guntanks_in_Space> especially when you put game engines and shit in mind
[4:08:31] <artcellrox> i thought the GGPO dudes said they'd help implemented it for low cost though?
[4:08:36] <DensityD> like that one where it appears the Donkey is 2 headed
[4:08:42] <Mendin> Fire Goose

[4:09:54] <+TheBesteban> Damn, I can't link the video in here, but I did a whole video on netcode. Look up Hold Back To Block on Youtube
[4:10:00] <Guntanks_in_Space> also to mind, getting it implemented right should be done right otherwise you get SFV lol
[4:10:02] <Charles445> grape joins the roster but he's holding a dakimakura of the kfriends idol
[4:10:08] <Guntanks_in_Space> where the netcode is poorly done even if it is rollback
[4:10:12] <Charles445> that's his weapon
[4:10:22] <Superbro64> reminder that keits interview is now subbed in Japanese
[4:10:24] <%QaizerArt> BDIBIT might be someone who ain't watching stream @WoolieVersus
[4:10:25] <+ggbhtg> not watching stream LUL
[4:10:27] <%croxeye> is bdbit watching the stream? or just a random maybe?

[4:10:43] <Fujiwara_92> yeah, he prob not watching
[4:10:47] <KalmVibrations> -_-
[4:10:53] <GamerWorlock> if not hes a random
[4:10:55] <Rangenade> beat his ass
[4:10:57] <%Irridium> yo so how come that netcode felt better than the vast majority of other fighting games'?
[4:10:59] <+ggbhtg> usually you SHOULDNT watch and stream anyway
[4:11:04] <PFlare> Oh my god, Woolie playing Fight of Animals, hell yeah.
[4:11:08] <+FoolsArcade> wow
[4:11:14] <%croxeye> cuz it's not made by a japanese dev Irridium lol
[4:11:14] <+ggbhtg> @irridium GGPO
[4:11:15] <DensityD> hey @WoolieVersus when was the most recent time you suffered from "one guy" in chat?
[4:11:21] <Guntanks_in_Space> but @WoolieVersus IT HAS NETCODE NOW
[4:11:22] <Superbro64> we have fight of animals REGULARS in here? PogChamp
[4:11:23] <DensityD> real glow-up
[4:11:26] <%Irridium> huh this GGPO is pretty neat more people should use it
[4:11:29] <artcellrox> @Guntanks_in_Space doesn't SF5 use its own form of rollback netcode though? and not GGPO?
[4:11:33] <Guntanks_in_Space> Fight of Gods has rollback of all things
[4:11:38] <+ggbhtg> @woolieversus FOG has GGPO now
[4:11:41] <Guntanks_in_Space> @artcellrox yea the Kagemusha thing iirc it's called
[4:11:43] <%croxeye> yeah they did see that message
[4:11:49] <Superbro64> @irridium its only existed since 2007 Kappa
[4:12:01] <Guntanks_in_Space> though iirc i heard MVCI has good rollback on it
[4:12:06] <Fujiwara_92> Suggested: Blocking
[4:12:15] <%Irridium> @Superbro64 NotLikeThis
[4:12:19] <%Wool> Fox is especially unsafe, which is why he's low tier
[4:12:28] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Suggested: Suggested: Suggested:
[4:12:32] <+ggbhtg> MCVI does have good rollback netcode unlike SFV
[4:12:34] <@Squdnate> Just to verify how good GGPO is. I'm from Denmark, and I experienced absolutely no lag at all against Reggie
[4:12:40] <mrparanoia07> MVCI and Power Rangers has good netcode. SFV has it bad.
[4:12:57] <+ggbhtg> good rollback u mean

[4:13:20] <Guntanks_in_Space> @Squdnate right? I'm from south east asia and i played a dude from florida and it nearly felt like offline lol
[4:13:22] <Superbro64> reminder that YEARS ago, Mori and Daisuke of Arc Sys, when asked about rollback, both said "We know about it. Please stop asking"
[4:13:25] <%king_wragles> @WoolieVersus remake the room with a password

[4:16:40] <artcellrox> something about NIH (not invented here)
[4:16:43] <ricingground3> "Good job so far"
[4:16:47] <fatally_furious> my prediction is Rollback in some form will be made like a Kagemusha to be used in multiple Arc Sys projects, maybe as soon as Guilty Gear Strive: Second Album or something
[4:16:50] <artcellrox> if it wasn't originated there, it's not really used

[4:17:33] <KalmVibrations> I just wanted the one game before sleep, it's past 6am over here. Thanks 6am -_-
[4:17:42] <Superbro64> considering that capcom HAS improved their rollback in mvci, but HAS NOT fixed it in SFV, their current spotlight title, says a lot

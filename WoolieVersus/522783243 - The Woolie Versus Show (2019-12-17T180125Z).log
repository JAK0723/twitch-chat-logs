[0:33:18] <kirketorp> unless you're winning
[0:33:18] <SvenHolgersson> FUCK MONOPOLY
[0:33:21] <Mendin> Nobody ever plays Monopoly right
[0:33:24] <%masterpiecejeremy> no joke. Minh recked me at Monopoly and it was such a good move on his part I wasn't even mad
[0:33:32] <JDebss> I like momopoly
[0:33:33] <+l33t_j4gu4r> just like real capitalism lol
[0:33:42] <derap41> Yes its a bad game its unbalanced and has random elements that lets players reach unbeatable level
[0:33:44] <zamzoph> @WoolieVersus play Diplomacy
[0:33:45] <+penndra> remember kids: say no to capitalism
[0:33:49] <Lenmutt> how long would a Risk stream be?
[0:33:51] <joshua_42> Monopoly: Socialism!
[0:33:55] <SvenHolgersson> Monopoly is less fun Life
[0:33:56] <DrkJP520> I've never played monopoly and I'm not 100% sure how it works
[0:33:59] <+Javaa01> A round of UNO is like 5-7 minutes, it's a quick game
[0:34:00] <lvl46palladium> The binding of isaac: four souls can cause some salt if people know how to play the game
[0:34:02] <SvenHolgersson> Which is kida ironic?
[0:34:03] <kirketorp> monopoly was created when the boomers were kids... explains a lot dont it?
[0:34:09] <fist_wizard_jay> the whole night will be scheming
[0:34:19] <fist_wizard_jay> instead of pop offa
[0:34:21] <+penndra> get that monopoly millenial version!!
[0:34:22] <fist_wizard_jay> offs*
[0:34:31] <derap41> The Dark Souls Board game was pretty good
[0:34:31] <JDebss> big$$$ though
[0:34:32] <SvenHolgersson> @Javaa01 Or we could get a sequel to The Uno Movie
[0:34:37] <jcramthehero> sheriff of Nottingham
[0:34:40] <GundamF91> Bloodborne board game
[0:34:40] <greenduck64> house on the hill pretty fun
[0:34:48] <JDebss> Play the Dark Souls board game!
[0:34:50] <%masterpiecejeremy> played Monopoly Cheaters edition once and a guy won by stealing the entire bank while no one was looking
[0:34:52] <Lenmutt> kickboard streams? like Kickstarter board game be the main focus
[0:34:57] <SvenHolgersson> Get into Boardgames sounds awesome
[0:35:03] <Mendin> @WoolieVersus Risk Legacy has shorter games and is effectively a built-in campaign
[0:35:05] <WanderingSwordsman> Goblin Slayer boardgame
[0:35:06] <+spodebroker> so are they playing Mario & Sonic or Indivisible?
[0:35:08] <zamzoph> pretty sure there are for Monopoloy
[0:35:10] <derap41> Its 100% luck based
[0:35:14] <+AtomicVR> Bro what's your Monopoly elo rank
[0:35:20] <+Javaa01> The world championship of Monopoly is the real estate market
[0:35:37] <+l33t_j4gu4r> greatest board game is called the omega virus
[0:35:44] <+AtomicVR> Also competitive monopoly is just capitalism
[0:35:44] <%Lion_kun> Play mahjong cowards
[0:35:44] <%masterpiecejeremy> @woolieversus Game Of Thrones Risk actually brings totally new mechanics like money management, ports and fortress that really change the game
[0:35:44] <+l33t_j4gu4r> had it as a kid
[0:35:46] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @kirketorp
[0:35:52] <%augusm> I'm surprised you guys know what a chelsea brick is
[0:35:59] <zamzoph> @WoolieVersus if you don't buy, properties go to auction
[0:36:08] <derap41> You have to move what the dice says
[0:36:14] <%Lion_kun> Mahjong is like 70% luck 30% skill
[0:36:18] <DrkJP520> Remember that there's professional rock-paper-scissor
[0:36:22] <Lenmutt> official rules? ummm i don't think i've ever used those
[0:36:28] <+ZENKENmaster> dope getup woolie
[0:36:28] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:36:41] <JDebss> yeah actual monopoly rules are the way to go
[0:36:46] <+l33t_j4gu4r> that speeds the game up a loooooot
[0:36:53] <zamzoph> House rules just end up slowing the game down
[0:36:56] <veraverse> Fun fact: You can't stack up +2 cards in UNO, officially
[0:36:58] <lvl46palladium> If you are looking for a good co op board game, Mice and mystics is pretty good in my opinion
[0:37:01] <Mendin> free parking does NOT have money on it ever
[0:37:22] <+l33t_j4gu4r> tabletop simulator!
[0:37:26] <+l33t_j4gu4r> ^_^
[0:37:28] <spirittiart> DnD
[0:37:32] <DrkJP520> You should play strip poker
[0:37:38] <derap41> Play warhammer 30k you nerd
[0:37:44] <+Polter_ge1st> Twister
[0:37:45] <derap41> 40K*
[0:37:51] <%jinking79> 8hr a game
[0:37:54] <JDebss> Risk takes too long
[0:37:55] <+Polter_ge1st> GROWN MEN TWISTER
[0:37:57] <Graxe_> Monopoly had official speed rules, too
[0:38:00] <zamzoph> but what about 30k tho?
[0:38:00] <spirittiart> Chessboxing
[0:38:00] <SvenHolgersson> Life is wayyyyyyyyyy better than Monopoly
[0:38:09] <JDebss> I vote Twister
[0:38:12] <%TheSniperJoe> Monopoly legit has rules to make the game not last forever but we always ignore them.
[0:38:12] <elmo_s_friend> lffnEZ
[0:38:16] <Reverend_Roscoe> Secret Hitler
[0:38:16] <%jinking79> when YOMI CARD GAME

[0:38:22] <Reverend_Roscoe> or werewolf
[0:38:22] <SvenHolgersson> Strip Twister
[0:38:36] <%ozzrabbit> Raise your hand if you’d send a board game to Woolie if he provided a PO Box.
[0:38:36] <derap41> You should play blood bowl as a board game its awesome
[0:38:37] <+Polter_ge1st> ^^^
[0:38:42] <+steelmorrigan> Settlers of Catan anyone?
[0:38:43] <spirittiart> MAHJONG
[0:38:51] <Graxe_> Fast Monopoly has the banker give everyone 3 properties at the start for free at random, for example
[0:38:58] <@SoushinSen> @steelmorrigan o/
[0:39:01] <FoxInABeret> woolieSHOOK
[0:39:02] <+SaintSucc> strip mahjong
[0:39:13] <derap41> A full blood bowl team cost like $300
[0:39:14] <+steelmorrigan> Who wouldn't like to hear Woolie declare "Wood for sheep!"
[0:39:16] <Mendin> does strip mahjong have the riichi round?
[0:39:20] <+TheMegamansam> Oh hey it’s that jojo guy
[0:39:24] <Graxe_> Bloodborne tabletop game
[0:39:31] <Graxe_> Or was it the Dark Souls one?
[0:39:35] <Graxe_> Or both>
[0:39:40] <Mendin> Kingdom Death Monster?
[0:39:45] <%jinking79> their BS Dice Rolls online
[0:39:47] <Mendin> (which Woolie I think actually owns)
[0:39:51] <veraverse> Sonic and Mario looks weird huh
[0:40:04] <+spodebroker> that's what I'm sayin'
[0:40:29] <Graxe_> Kingdom Death Monster was done on the previous Tablelords episodes in Tabletop Sim
[0:40:56] <%Lion_kun> Is this game almost done?
[0:41:04] <Mendin> Heh he thinks he has maximum traversal
[0:41:08] <veraverse> Parkour
[0:41:21] <Mendin> Storyline wise he's near the end, but he hasnt started Sidequest-O-Rama yet
[0:41:23] <+theAncopro> just kanuul and then sidewuests if he's feelin it
[0:42:02] <veraverse> The music sounds insane
[0:42:02] <%Lion_kun> Tx
[0:42:07] <derap41> He's so good
[0:42:11] <+bmj614> You can open a spot where you found Yan!!!!
[0:42:14] <Mendin> BIG NUMBER
[0:42:26] <veraverse> JESUS CHRIST
[0:42:26] <derap41> What the current hit record?
[0:42:31] <+penndra> :O
[0:42:43] <jase__x> TOD
[0:43:35] <Mendin> Reset the switch?
[0:43:36] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1204820081542402050?s=19
[0:43:59] <derap41> Canoodle?
[0:44:26] <veraverse> Damn
[0:44:30] <+TopTieramisu> wtf is this perspective?
[0:45:25] <derap41> Ajna "I'm helping"
[0:45:55] <veraverse> When you sit with the smart kids, and know nothing about the subject. That's Ajna now
[0:46:03] <Setaro> The enemies have so much hp :o
[0:46:23] <+teddybomber> I hated those tanks
[0:46:30] <derap41> @Setaro it is a tank after all
[0:46:40] <+theAncopro> you can put a big blanket over it
[0:46:54] <%Lion_kun> Woolie thinks this is more fun than Sekiro lol
[0:47:08] <veraverse> I guess the real bad ending was the friends we made along the way
[0:47:16] <Mendin> I wonder if it would have been faster to get back into the factory and take the warp gate home
[0:47:20] <jase__x> woolie is weird\
[0:47:39] <%Lion_kun> Enemies are so spongey.
[0:47:56] <derap41> Remember they're all stuck in her brain I think they're trying to stay on her good side
[0:47:57] <+theAncopro> except Razmi who has been consistent the whole way
[0:48:21] <Mendin> Razmi has been an enaber the entire time though
[0:48:22] <+Matt_Made> Where we at in the story?
[0:48:30] <%Lion_kun> Endgame
[0:48:30] <Mendin> 2/3 revists complete
[0:48:36] <+Matt_Made> Ah.
[0:48:45] <+Matt_Made> The fun stuff
[0:48:46] <%ozzrabbit> Mostly because Razmi burned down her own house.
[0:48:46] <Yukai_Yami> You’re giving the dialogue too much credit...
[0:48:53] <veraverse> "I won't piss off my home"
[0:48:57] <derap41> @Matt_Made you know when the hero is at their lowest and the feel like they've failed yeah that part
[0:48:58] <jase__x> way to much credit
[0:49:05] <Mendin> She burned down her own house because there were enemy soldiers in it
[0:49:06] <+TopTieramisu> "PEACE"
[0:49:43] <+theAncopro> try it on enemies
[0:49:49] <%Lion_kun> Isn't the protag like some huge hypocrite?
[0:49:50] <+Matt_Made> Juggle enemies
[0:50:05] <Mendin> the protag is a Furious Dumbass
[0:50:19] <derap41> The Protag is Naruto but worse
[0:50:23] <Iggeh0> @Lion_kun she does some bad things, and in a span of 3 minutes realizes it, comes to terms with her mistakes and moves on to fixing them
[0:50:36] <@Menitta> I haven't been following the LP and I dropped the game. What...exactly does she do
[0:50:37] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:50:54] <+Matt_Made> She is dumb and i kinda blame her dad
[0:51:09] <derap41> @Menitta tries to do good fucks up and does bad because she's dumb
[0:51:48] <%Lion_kun> At least that guy who killed her dad had an arc whetr he tried to atone for his sins
[0:51:53] <+HugsTheGreat> 16 year old girl should be listened to
[0:52:12] <derap41> its a bit like in DnD where the DM has to keep the plot going so everytime the players save the world they actually doom it worse.
[0:52:25] <straydog505> omg I remember when Etika asked ppl to support this game when it was on kickstarter :( he really wanted to try this game someday.....
[0:52:30] <derap41> Like Harmon Quest
[0:52:40] <@Menitta> Is it like "I accidentally unleashed unstoppable evil again"
[0:52:44] <jase__x> ajna's the one bad player on the dnd team
[0:53:03] <+Matt_Made> @Menitta Kinda.
[0:53:18] <derap41> @Menitta More like I fucked this city up worse trying to stop this evil I unleased
[0:53:28] <Mendin> It's the wrench moles from SMB3
[0:53:42] <%Lion_kun> I want trigger to make a little witch academia season 2
[0:53:43] <veraverse> Basically, it's some Spec Ops The Line shit
[0:54:01] <derap41> @veraverse You think you're the hero of this story?
[0:54:11] <Mendin> Did you lose the ringsel from htiting the spikes?
[0:54:26] <+TopTieramisu> that's a long spatula
[0:55:03] <derap41> Is sounds like you'rer saying Canoodle
[0:55:31] <veraverse> Super Jump Party
[0:55:38] <+Matt_Made> High jumpers only
[0:56:05] <veraverse> Getting so high, in all ways possible
[0:56:20] <+theAncopro> your holding up
[0:56:45] <Mendin> Maybe do the curve-dash first then th e high jump?
[0:57:18] <+TopTieramisu> welp
[0:57:20] <derap41> This is some Getting over it shit
[0:57:29] <+Matt_Made> Oh he doesnt have the true platforming traversal
[0:57:29] <veraverse> Getting Over with Woolie Woolz
[0:58:04] <Mendin> Woolie suddenly has to puke into his shirt
[0:58:04] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:58:25] <veraverse> Plot twist: Woolie is with a purse by his side
[0:58:25] <Iggeh0> @Mendin it's the safest option after all
[0:58:40] <@Menitta> @woolieversus Btw, you never uploaded this week's schedule
[0:58:42] <Mendin> It's red-bull-proof
[0:58:43] <derap41> Unless you have a hat
[0:59:01] <Kaito_Cam> Perrrrrrrrsooonnaaaaa

[1:02:03] <veraverse> Getting Over it With Woolievs
[1:02:31] <+gustavozxd> I haven't played this game but I get the feeling Woolie makes the platforming way harder than it is somehow
[1:02:40] <+theAncopro> you miiiiight need another ability
[1:03:15] <veraverse> I'm starting to miss that Ubisoft Metroidvania
[1:03:16] <+TopTieramisu> the nooch axe
[1:03:20] <veraverse> I forgot the name
[1:03:23] <Mendin> So there's Big Irony for people who know the game
[1:03:29] <+gustavozxd> child of light ?
[1:03:29] <+Polter_ge1st> Nooch Axe
[1:03:49] <veraverse> No, it was one truly focused on plataforming
[1:03:54] <+theAncopro> you could try going on the roof to the right
[1:04:10] <+theAncopro> oho
[1:04:11] <%Lion_kun> I feel this is the unintended method
[1:04:20] <derap41> Didn't even need the axe
[1:04:21] <+gustavozxd> now I'm curious
[1:04:28] <+MrRabbles> sequence break boys
[1:04:42] <veraverse> Outland!
[1:04:49] <veraverse> It was Outland
[1:04:51] <+gustavozxd> yeah I was about to say, Outland
[1:04:59] <+gustavozxd> never heard of it
[1:05:15] <veraverse> Never finished it, the final boss was a shitshow

[1:20:52] <+Matt_Made> What battle?
[1:21:08] <%jinking79> chance of them beating the game Today

[1:22:02] <+theAncopro> don't think they'll finish today, especially if they want to check out some of the sidequests
[1:22:22] <+ConLin_Arts_> yeah that will take a while
[1:22:45] <%jinking79> hard whiff
[1:23:00] <Mendin> There's at least three sidequests I want Woolie to do: Ren's, Phoebe's, and Gun Man's

[1:38:52] <+ConLin_Arts_> she tries her best

[1:43:25] <%Lion_kun> RiP Dhar
[1:43:31] <Mendin> Reggie has the wisdom of the falcon
[1:43:46] <derap41> Some members add stuff sometimes
[1:43:46] <joshua_42> Poor Dhar he didn’t he deserve what happened to him
[1:43:48] <RDMOOSE> It all makes sense now! SingsNote SingsNote SingsNote SingsNote
[1:43:53] <jase__x> what happened to all the guy characters...oh wait
[1:43:56] <Mendin> Talk to people in your head to get sidequests
[1:43:59] <+theAncopro> dha not even a memory
[1:44:00] <+Matt_Made> @joshua_42 He kinda did
[1:44:05] <+MrRabbles> the smell of dead dhar
[1:44:08] <derap41> Dhar wasn't wrong he was just an asshole
[1:44:14] <%Lion_kun> Someone whisper to me if Dhar is dead for real please.
[1:44:23] <+Superbro64> did everyone forget about dhar of
[1:44:24] <+Matt_Made> He was totally wrong. He attacked villages for no good reason
[1:44:30] <+Superbro64> or something?
[1:44:32] <arkv01> sumfin fishy
[1:44:40] <joshua_42> I guess so
[1:44:48] <derap41> Dhar attacked that village to save the world
[1:44:54] <joshua_42> Everyone has forgotten about Dhar
[1:45:02] <Iggeh0> Dhar was saving the world from Ajna
[1:45:05] <jase__x> who's dhar
[1:45:05] <%Lion_kun> Dhar did nothing wrong.
[1:45:13] <Mendin> Get Hunoch's
[1:45:15] <+Sendaar> #fuckAnja
[1:45:16] <Mendin> While you're here too
[1:45:17] <+Matt_Made> Nah he got what was coming to him
[1:45:23] <+theAncopro> dhar's a weird way to pronounce bar
[1:45:23] <derap41> Just fug already
[1:45:25] <+MrRabbles> if Dhar was so smart how come he's dead Kappa
[1:45:26] <+Matt_Made> Tricked or not
[1:45:27] <%jinking79> everyone that burn Ajna Village r dead
[1:45:39] <Mendin> Tsitsi isnt her sister
[1:45:44] <joshua_42> If Dhar was so good why isn’t there Dhar 2
[1:45:45] <+theAncopro> the sister is by the chakra gate
[1:45:46] <thegreatbambe> this is some dom sub shit eradicating off of them
[1:45:47] <%ozzrabbit> Other sister
[1:45:53] <arkv01> my queen I am ready to serve Kreygasm
[1:46:21] <Yukai_Yami> Isn’t her sister someone else..?
[1:46:36] <%masterpiecejeremy> Queen, dont stomp on your enemies. they'll enjoy it too much!
[1:46:43] <derap41> Ajna turn around dumbass
[1:46:54] <%Lion_kun> I feel there's something off with a story's writing when a character dies and you barely remember it happened. It doesn't help this game has like a billion side characters.
[1:47:21] <EndgameContent> I wonder when Woolie will learn how to juggle
[1:47:29] <EndgameContent> And notice how it gives a lot more meter
[1:47:30] <+Matt_Made> @Lion_kun Like when Rhavannavar died?
[1:47:41] <arkv01> @EndgameContent when he learns to DODGE THIS
[1:47:41] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1204820081542402050?s=19
[1:47:48] <%Lion_kun> Who?
[1:47:53] <%masterpiecejeremy> Woolie already learned to juggled fracture friendships @endgamecontent
[1:47:53] <joshua_42> Oh my god he did die right?
[1:47:54] <EndgameContent> The game gets so much more fun once enemies stop hitting the ground.
[1:47:54] <+Matt_Made> Exactly!
[1:47:56] <derap41> XD
[1:48:16] <EndgameContent> @masterpiecejeremy :(

[1:49:00] <%ozzrabbit> Talk to the other sister that’s back with the rest of the villagers
[1:49:00] <+MrRabbles> smells like lie
[1:49:01] <joshua_42> What was Rhavannavar’s deal again?
[1:49:18] <plushysceptile> Yeah, why did he attack all the villages and that?
[1:49:40] <+theAncopro> rhavanavar just wanted to wake up kala but he only had weak boys on his team
[1:49:48] <derap41> @joshua_42 wanted to wake Kala to make the world perfect killed that village because it was litterally just tehre
[1:50:00] <%Lion_kun> Wait when and how did he die? I've been watching this lp from the beginning and I didn't even notice he died lol
[1:50:08] <derap41> Kala killed him
[1:50:18] <Yukai_Yami> I feel the 3 big cities need more warp points than just the chakra gate. Especially if you can’t run from battles
[1:50:23] <morcego_cinzento_arts> he wanted to get enough idhi so he would stay the same as an imortal parasite in Kala's cycles of death and reincarnations
[1:50:32] <%Lion_kun> So much for being the final boss.
[1:50:43] <plushysceptile> He got got after the airship got destroyed
[1:50:52] <morcego_cinzento_arts> he died in the Sumaru mountains when Ajna ended up awaken Kala
[1:51:32] <derap41> And now Anja is fixing a bunch of stuff she ruined in order to fight Kala
[1:52:04] <derap41> That's a well fed baby

[2:06:18] <drefizz> is that a kamn rider
[2:06:23] <morcego_cinzento_arts> so basically this is Dark Souls 1 if you got the right of rekindling sooner then the short cuts/physical connections
[2:06:44] <joshua_42> Naga Rider is the best character in this entire game
[2:06:44] <zenith0111> I WANT TO BE A RIDER
[2:06:51] <Yukai_Yami> Naga’s color 4 is cool, but the Guren color is better...

[2:11:12] <morcego_cinzento_arts> butched it but still hype combo finished
[2:12:18] <morcego_cinzento_arts> I just love how her dad looks like he hit the limit of how lil of a fuck he gives all of this. In fact he gives so lil a fuck that he might as well be celibate
[2:12:37] <+Prevot> what
[2:12:53] <morcego_cinzento_arts> eh i made a terrible joke
[2:13:44] <derap41> So the smasher is just another meth addict
[2:14:03] <thegreatbambe> guttural screaming from woolie is the best
[2:14:07] <gunsrlove> Always gotta smash
[2:14:24] <derap41> This isn't Smash this a bum beat down
[2:14:28] <morcego_cinzento_arts> No unique sprites for this side quest. At least they got that portion right for an rpg mechanic
[2:14:37] <Yukai_Yami> I mean, he could’ve been indoors when it rained...
[2:14:51] <derap41> Sprinkle some crack on him and lets get out of here
[2:15:11] <gunsrlove> You will never Smash again villain
[2:15:17] <gunsrlove> Go take a shower
[2:15:21] <gunsrlove> and buy some deodorant
[2:15:44] <derap41> Looks like a smash player
[2:15:50] <Yukai_Yami> That’s some strong water
[2:15:53] <+Story_Ark> just pour some bath water
[2:15:58] <+Prevot> probably still stinks
[2:16:06] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Damn Thorani's water healing is so good that it fixed this recoloured enemy into an unique design

[2:22:19] <WanderingSwordsman> "It is what it is"
[2:22:40] <+MrRabbles> the fact that it was a side mission does that mean Ajna had no intention of helping otherwise

[0:02:37] <+VidulaSaix> Speaking of weebs, this season of Gon in 60 Seconds is godlike

[0:02:49] <alrobot2014> @DesertPenguin do you ever get the feeling that your eyes are blurring more than usual then realize a video is just in 480p
[0:02:50] <+locutus_of_the_porg> is audio working or is it me
[0:02:54] <$theKittenhugs> I can't wait for 2025 when Woolie learns about Nen

Really hyped myself up for Dante in Smash, so I am to blame for my own disappointment, but I came up with an idea. Perfect guarding is a mechanic. What if doing it with Dante filled a Royal Guard meter, and down b is royal guard release. Maybe next time
[0:08:06] <+locutus_of_the_porg> airsof3Phattylightsaber
[0:08:07] <Ultrahalda> I like how you disguised a NUNS 4 stream as a Death Stranding stream

[0:09:34] <+Superbro64> japan has games from ONLY japan tho

[0:10:08] <+PeanutJesus> Coming from a place where arcades just don't exist anymore, I am jelly
[0:10:27] <+Superbro64> to be fair, arcades are all but dead
[0:10:39] <acedeone> that sounds like a smaller scale of what Disney Quest was
[0:10:41] <+Zimpirate> The same with malls in the USA
[0:10:47] <+ggbhtg> Every time I go to anime conventions, the game rooms mean nothing to me....BUT GHOST ARCADE THO
[0:10:50] <+Zimpirate> malls are dying

[0:11:46] <+ggbhtg> The first time I went to Combo Breaker, we went over to a local mall, and it was SUPER dying

[0:17:26] <+linSP> we got a cbt store in our town
[0:17:32] <+VidulaSaix> Tekken will forever be dope
[0:17:40] <%LiterallyTotori> it's been legal in Oregon for nearly two years-.
[0:17:45] <+ggbhtg> Thanks for liking his stream
[0:17:48] <+Superbro64> leeroy, leeroys everywhere
[0:17:58] <+Superbro64> sea of dreads, flooding the green ranks
[0:18:05] <%LordSDB> Side step leroy to his left
[0:18:25] <%LordSDB> A lot of his good stuff is punishable when you do that
[0:18:35] <%LordSDB> But to his left
[0:18:38] <+Superbro64> may god grace us with a nerf, so our righteous suffering can end
[0:18:48] <thesickestzak> Just don’t get hit 4Head
[0:19:06] <%LiterallyTotori> raise your shield-
[0:19:18] <+Taglog7> ohh he's talking about tekken
[0:19:22] <acedeone> don't drop your shield
[0:19:24] <+Superbro64> place your bets now chat, how many leeroy mirrors in evo japan?
[0:19:39] <+ggbhtg> I REALLY hate not knowing the matchups in Tekken...because when you know it, that's some GOOD ASS TEKKEN.
[0:19:45] <+StreakThunderstorm> Whats good Woolie.
[0:20:10] <%LiterallyTotori> watching pros play Tekken is insanely hype because they understand the matchup.
[0:20:10] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:20:27] <%gatorafan> !uptime
[0:20:28] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 28 minutes and 53 seconds
[0:20:40] <+Superbro64> look at the bright side, it could of been tekken 6 bob doodSinwata
[0:20:48] <thesickestzak> joltzTheThing SSStyling
[0:21:02] <+ggbhtg> Because the combos DON'T REALLY matter compared to fundamentals
[0:21:38] <+ggbhtg> Having a wall carry in Tekken is all well and good...
[0:22:01] <TheOriginOfAll> fyi this guy is Canadian use this info wisely
[0:22:16] <+Superbro64> pity we have no virtua fighter 6 to compare it against
[0:22:21] <Arek_1> I just hate having to Korean backdash like a spaz just to get some decent movement in Tekken.
[0:22:23] <%bread_assassin> So lower floor, higher ceiling.
[0:22:31] <%LiterallyTotori> Tekken is a grind.
[0:22:34] <+VidulaSaix> That godlike video LUL
[0:22:35] <+ggbhtg> Having a wall carry is all well and good, until you can never land it
[0:22:46] <acedeone> what chapter is Woolie on in DS?
[0:22:47] <%DesertPenguin> They think people in the rooms would come out and ask what the noise was
[0:22:58] <+StreakThunderstorm> So apparently, FrostyFaustings had a Smackdown tournament and I didn't get to watch it because I was at TNS8. HOW WAS IT???
[0:22:59] <+VidulaSaix> LUL
[0:23:04] <@akuda_bar> More like maximum awkward
[0:23:04] <%gatorafan> woolieWHENS woolieCHAN
[0:23:06] <+ggbhtg> Why Korean backdash, when you can just sidestep cancel?
[0:23:12] <+MoralCompassGaming> Woolie knows how to avoid awkward situations, after that ontreal cop fun time they had.
[0:23:12] <Nina96> in 20 years
[0:23:16] <+Superbro64> no spoilers chat
[0:23:20] <+MoralCompassGaming> montreal*
[0:23:52] <+MoralCompassGaming> boy do we not
[0:23:59] <+ggbhtg> RIP RPGs
[0:24:04] <%LordSDB> Yeah Korean BD isn't a tech you need to learn in tekken. It's just one of many options in the game
[0:24:18] <+VidulaSaix> Sekiro LUL
[0:24:22] <acedeone> sick juggles for less time in life
[0:24:22] <%blaggablag> One of these days I'm going to try and replay FF7 and NEVER finish it
[0:24:24] <thesickestzak> Just play the same games over and over again Kappa
[0:24:35] <+ggbhtg> ^
[0:24:36] <%gatorafan> COWARDS Kappa
[0:24:41] <+ChrisBardow> Is there any form of content you think the fgc needs that isn't being created or taken to the level it could be?
[0:24:54] <+VidulaSaix> Sekiro was the right pick. I dropped it at the same spot due to waning interest
[0:25:01] <+Superbro64> not everyone can be max and world first any percent every new game every time Kappa
[0:25:01] <+MoralCompassGaming> i'm trying to get back into tekken. haven't played since 3 or4. Learning hwaorang again.
[0:25:08] <+ggbhtg> Don't forget you're here forever
[0:25:21] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @VidulaSaix
[0:25:25] <%ultrasparkseid> LUL LUL LUL
[0:25:34] <+ggbhtg> Get shot Saix LUL
[0:25:37] <%Jetzord> Jetzord subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:25:39] <+VidulaSaix> GOD the BYLETH REVEAL was LEGENDARY LUL
[0:25:48] <thesickestzak> Watching that stream with Max was amazing
[0:25:49] <DaikiWithDaShot> Salt is tasty
[0:25:51] <+ggbhtg> Bayleaf!!!
[0:25:54] <%gatorafan> Geno is coming next time Woolie, for sure daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:25:58] <+VidulaSaix> The memes and reactions that came from it was delicious
[0:26:01] <+ggbhtg> LET'S GOOOO Bayleaf!
[0:26:10] <@Solidus_113> BUT THEN CUPHEAD
[0:26:18] <Nina96> poor max
[0:26:21] <Arek_1> The vocal (minority?) of FE fans are insufferable.
[0:26:22] <acedeone> Sakurai sez expect Geno 2025 Kappa
[0:26:25] <+linSP> get these nintendo characters out of my fire emblem smash game!
[0:26:26] <EndgameContent> Byleth is as close as I can hope for Monster Hunter in Smash
[0:26:27] <+VidulaSaix> Dude, Sakurai building it up right before the trailer too. That motherfucker knew EXACTLY what he was doing
[0:26:28] <+VidulaSaix> LUL
[0:26:38] <+ggbhtg> Bayleaf is my favorite of Ash's Pokemon in Johto
[0:26:41] <DaikiWithDaShot> I love how everyone was more hype for a Cuphead costume than the new character revealed
[0:26:42] <%CaptainPileDriver> wish i coulda gone to galloping ghosts arcade
[0:26:42] <thesickestzak> My favorite meme from that was “Oops all fire emblem”
[0:26:43] <acedeone> what's it called what's it called???
[0:26:44] <EndgameContent> I think Woolie will like them for that reason alone
[0:26:44] <%Jetzord> Byleth got the Roman Reigns treatment from the fans (pre-cancer)
[0:26:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> fuck byleth
[0:26:57] <acedeone> Max's stream was hilarious
[0:26:58] <Arek_1> A multi-weapon fighter would be refreshing if Byleth wasn't THE EIGHT FE CHARACTER!
[0:27:05] <DaikiWithDaShot> The best part is FE fans didn't even want Byleth. But we get him anyway
[0:27:13] <%bread_assassin> At least it’s better than DBZ Fighters adding another Goku.
[0:27:13] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:27:23] <+MoralCompassGaming> You've had your christmas Cakie Woolie? is that what you're saying?
[0:27:24] <Nina96> My actual ideal was that this was the last dlc cause Sakurai can get some sleep
[0:27:30] <+MoralCompassGaming> Kappa
[0:27:32] <@Solidus_113> Corrin came out before Fates was even announced for the West
[0:27:32] <+ggbhtg> Also, don't tweet Sora_Sakurai for shit
[0:27:32] <%LiterallyTotori> Sakurai doesn't care, he was happy with that reveal and you can't take that away from him.
[0:27:33] <%gatorafan> Rex is too new tho, like Skullgirls daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:27:34] <%supersugoisenpai1> Byleth does look fun to play
[0:27:35] <+PenmanLupine> Max said it in his own video. This is Sakurai's game. Sakurai gets what Sakurai wants. If it's what you want, that's nice. If not, complaints won't be heard
[0:27:35] <Goraka91> Also those weapons Byleth use make me think that used to be Monster Hunter
[0:27:36] <+VidulaSaix> That can't be true cause Joker didn't even exist when that list would've been made
[0:27:49] <sirmadmikeog> Stay Humble
[0:27:52] <%ultrasparkseid> Still got 6 more comin'
[0:27:58] <+ggbhtg> Shitto the hell down, Don't ask Sakurai for shit, okay
[0:28:08] <%blaggablag> Stay humble, hustle harder
[0:28:16] <+VidulaSaix> I'm not even mad that we didn't get Dante. I love the memes more than the character LUL
[0:28:18] <+Superbro64> thank god we have a season 2
[0:28:31] <%LiterallyTotori> We need Harada to give Sakurai THE SHIRT.
[0:28:36] <Nina96> if they swapped Beylth and terry announcements i dont think people wouldn't be as mad
[0:28:38] <+ivansonic08> But then BAYO THOU
[0:28:42] <%gatorafan> Let the voice of disappointment take you higher? daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:28:44] <+VidulaSaix> That too @Nina96
[0:28:49] <Tracazoid> Kiryu
[0:28:50] <Cubblesv2> the voice will hit the window and be met with: "more Fire Emblem? Sure!"
[0:28:50] <@Solidus_113> 6 more chances for Dante, Sora, Ammy, and everyone else
[0:29:01] <+Superbro64> "sora" LUL
[0:29:05] <Man_in_the_Red> my only real gripe is the streak of amazing series rep picks is done
[0:29:08] <%Jetzord> Well Sakurai said all 6 characters were already picked so hopefully he's in there
[0:29:08] <+Superbro64> I will eat my hat
[0:29:10] <@Solidus_113> Capcom has so many legendary characters
[0:29:21] <+Superbro64> you have a better chance at wolverine then sora, straight up
[0:29:29] <+ggbhtg> I'm still waiting for Harada to guest star on Sakurai's LP series
[0:29:31] <+Mrthefro> How far ahead is the stream from the Lp?
[0:29:40] <%CaptainPileDriver> there is no way byleth was chosen 3 years ago
[0:29:48] <Arek_1> No Dante? Fine. Astral Chain guy/girl would've been way better than Byleth.
[0:29:50] <DaikiWithDaShot> Is hoes mad still funny? Can I say it without starting a war in this chat?
[0:29:51] <Goraka91> So I just noticed...is that a Gears of War shirt?
[0:29:57] <+Superbro64> I'm just impressed we only have 1 bamco rep at this point, I think
[0:29:59] <+Mkingston> Solaire
[0:30:06] <+Taglog7> bobble dragon would've been sic
[0:30:07] <Nina96> so your saying Dante is niche?
[0:30:08] <+Dimfish> byleths cool
[0:30:11] <%blaggablag> I'd stan so hard for the bubble bubble dragons tho
[0:30:15] <%CaptainPileDriver> why couldn't byleth been the 2nd to last
[0:30:17] <+ggbhtg> Bub and Bob?
[0:30:19] <@Solidus_113> Byleth got in as a character while XC2 Rex only gets a Mii outfit
[0:30:27] <%The_Timo> Crap, going to company dinner, I'll be back midway through next delivery lol
[0:30:38] <+VidulaSaix> Dude, I can't even begin to tell you how much my heart was ready to sink if I saw a Dante Mii outfit LUL
[0:30:38] <+Mkingston> Bees?
[0:30:43] <Sogeki_Dan> When is Joker in smash?
[0:30:45] <Kongro_> I'm gonna pretend Byleth is Monster Hunter and try to be happy about it all.
[0:30:48] <Louie_Salmon> Dante has actually too many moves to pick from, I don't think you could even fit them all
[0:30:51] <thesickestzak> Not the BEES
[0:30:54] <Goraka91> Playstation what LUL
[0:30:58] <+MoralCompassGaming> All Stars was fun
[0:31:03] <%LiterallyTotori> Dante adopts the Shulk mechanic and DT is a single move from a charge meter.
[0:31:04] <+Superbro64> to be fair, cuphead and sans are also mii costumes
[0:31:10] <Arek_1> @DaikiWithDaShot "Hoes mad" peaked with Hero. LUL
[0:31:12] <%CaptainPileDriver> seriously, sakurai knew people would hate byleth which why that preamble
[0:31:15] <+ggbhtg> OBVIOUSLY having a moveset is the only thing that determines if a character can be in Smash Kappa
[0:31:17] <@Solidus_113> consoom Smash
[0:31:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> was the way it was
[0:31:24] <+BionoidLCR> @Sogeki_Dan what do you mean when?
[0:31:28] <Laironx3> Man who eats too much cake blames cake.
[0:31:30] <Louie_Salmon> Joker has rainstorm, that's enough for me.
[0:31:35] <%LiterallyTotori> or it acts like Arsene.
[0:31:36] <DaikiWithDaShot> @arek_1 Oh man lol
[0:31:37] <+ggbhtg> Eat up Piggies
[0:31:40] <thesickestzak> E N G O R G E on Smash
[0:31:41] <+Mkingston> Until your Switch storage is full
[0:31:41] <%CaptainPileDriver> at least 1 is gonna be a dissapointment if the smash dlc has taught us something
[0:31:43] <+Superbro64> is japan still crying to the high heavens for atoria? the fate character?
[0:31:51] <N1netbattler> Is this a Reggie podcast tho?
[0:31:51] <+ggbhtg> Devour Hour, you Oinkers
[0:31:51] <+Artemis_Scowl> I cant wait for 6 more fire emblem characters lol
[0:31:53] <Cubblesv2> I'll take the hit on Dante if we get Harada in Smash instead
[0:32:00] <Sogeki_Dan> @BionoidLCR Mortal Kombat Joker. Not animu Joker
[0:32:00] <Goraka91> @Kongro_ Like that's straight up GS Bow and Lance moves it's a little weird
[0:32:00] <Nina96> most people ive seen are more disappointed than made
[0:32:01] <%CaptainPileDriver> DEAL
[0:32:03] <+ivansonic08> 6 MORE FIRE EMBLEMS
[0:32:04] <%gatorafan> you know we are getting one more Pokemon
[0:32:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> i'm down super for that
[0:32:06] <Nina96> mad*
[0:32:06] <+Mkingston> mic drop
[0:32:08] <Man_in_the_Red> Pleh Kot9r too iz da bast
[0:32:09] <donstylo> If I have 1 wish, my wish would be Regina (Dino Crisis) for Smash.
[0:32:10] <+VidulaSaix> So it's not the new LP. Interesting
[0:32:11] <+allups> confirmed
[0:32:12] <+BionoidLCR> @Sogeki_Dan no clue then
[0:32:15] <%ultrasparkseid> oooo
[0:32:17] <%GeneralSCPatton> YEYEYE
[0:32:19] <DaikiWithDaShot> Hell yeah
[0:32:28] <%CaptainPileDriver> that's fair
[0:32:29] <%LiterallyTotori> what's a star wars did the stars have a disagreement
[0:32:32] <+VidulaSaix> Yeah definitely
[0:32:33] <alrobot2014> oooh so we still get a surprise
[0:32:35] <+draykingjaymes> Is fire emblem that good of game? @woolieversus
[0:32:43] <Ultrahalda> NUNS 4
[0:32:44] <%bread_assassin> Ayyyyy
[0:32:49] <Nina96> fe is fine
[0:32:51] <thesickestzak> FFX-2 Thursday confirmed Kappa
[0:32:51] <+iFranzC> Will we see Lethal League at all? I picked it up recently on my switch.
[0:32:54] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> Who is the man to the left? I'm new here
[0:32:57] <Nina96> fates was bad
[0:33:00] <%gatorafan> Are we going back to one-offs? Or are we actually talking short games? daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:33:00] <Man_in_the_Red> @drayjaymes if you like dating simulators, yes Kappa
[0:33:01] <+allups> the long games are harder to keep up with as someone that mostly watches on yt
[0:33:08] <DaikiWithDaShot> FE is good, I don't think it's Woolie's cup of tea
[0:33:11] <Goraka91> Some people seem to like Fire Emblem (like a certain someone)
[0:33:14] <Kongro_> Yeah, Kotor 2 feels like something you might play in.. 2 years or so when things are calm
[0:33:17] <+Mkingston> So when's Genital Jousting?
[0:33:25] <+Taglog7> long long man?
[0:33:30] <%DesertPenguin> DARK SOULS 3 LET'S GOOOOO
[0:33:32] <donstylo> Woolie, KotOR has 2 game breaking bugs and you can have them very fast so be careful.
[0:33:36] <+VidulaSaix> Sounds great
[0:33:38] <+MoralCompassGaming> ooh, neato
[0:33:39] <%LiterallyTotori> Fates is a fever dream, the FE community will admit that. every other game is pretty good if SRPGs are your thing.
[0:33:48] <%DesertPenguin> Pat?
[0:33:50] <Laironx3> PlagueofGripes? Kappa
[0:33:52] <+Superbro64> fe lp ONLY if woolie does permadeath, and isnt allowed to rotate saves
[0:33:52] <DaikiWithDaShot> @literallytotori this
[0:33:54] <+VidulaSaix> God no @DesertPenguin LUL
[0:33:58] <+Mkingston> I own both Kotors but I've never played them.
[0:33:58] <+liquidzr0> is it German spy?
[0:33:58] <+allups> eyepatchy wolf
[0:34:01] <+allups> ?
[0:34:03] <+ivansonic08> So no reggie?
[0:34:07] <Tucker0603> but I can't make it to Canada...
[0:34:08] <Nina96> actually cant guess who
[0:34:08] <%gatorafan> That's a very good idea Woolie, you shouldn't try to make the same character again
[0:34:15] <thesickestzak> Minh! Lol
[0:34:15] <+Ryu_R> new harem member PogChamp
[0:34:16] <%DesertPenguin> I'd like another "proper" Castle Super Beast LP like DMC5 or RE2:Remake
[0:34:17] <Kongro_> Can't believe Mike Stoklasa is gonna play Kotor 2 with Woolie
[0:34:18] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1219688583491092483?s=19
[0:34:20] <TigerClaws12> but Pat tho
[0:34:21] <%bread_assassin> Still do Dark Side, though.
[0:34:26] <Mrbaconator> that's all i needed woolie
[0:34:28] <+MoralCompassGaming> Would you be interested in Slay the Spire? it's a short little rogue-lite.
[0:34:31] <Nina96> duo LP or 3 people?
[0:34:34] <%gatorafan> George Lucas confirmed PogChamp
[0:34:35] <%DesertPenguin> Woolie and Pat together is so much entertainment. We need another one of those
[0:34:36] <Laironx3> Vinny vinesauce
[0:34:37] <thesickestzak> Just be patient
[0:34:49] <AmericanaRed> apatHoldon
[0:34:52] <+ggbhtg> 2Snacks doodChamp
[0:35:03] <Man_in_the_Red> Slay the Spire would be a good one off
[0:35:07] <Goraka91> Is that a food
[0:35:07] <+MoralCompassGaming> The alcohol?
[0:35:09] <thesickestzak> Stop censoring Pat and have him on
[0:35:09] <Nina96> we need at least 1 Pat and woolie LP this decade
[0:35:12] <donstylo> Reggie looks so Pulp Fiction, I love it!
[0:35:13] <+MoralCompassGaming> That stuff is nightmares
[0:35:17] <%blaggablag> It's less a drink and more an inside joke
[0:35:18] <Tucker0603> oh God! that! D:
[0:35:25] <Kongro_> That sounds like a curse
[0:35:30] <%blaggablag> p much
[0:35:32] <Goraka91> It's not the thumb one is it?
[0:35:36] <Kongro_> Oh...
[0:35:39] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> @donstylo WAIT IS THIS THE FABLED REGGIE?
[0:35:40] <@akuda_bar> It's a Chicago liquor that tastes like a burnt condom, we tried it with KQ people in Chicago. tastes bad
[0:35:43] <+Mkingston> Have you seen Digital Foundry's new Doom Eternal video? It looks like an ultra violent Metroid Prime.
[0:35:44] <+ggbhtg> well yes, but actually no
[0:35:48] <Tucker0603> it's a vile liquor
[0:35:57] <+MoralCompassGaming> @EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries Yes, Mr. FootFetish himself
[0:36:19] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> @MoralCompassGaming ah, more of an assman myself
[0:36:28] <@akuda_bar> the kq scene wouldn't let us leave without tasting it
[0:36:30] <%LiterallyTotori> Anyway, need to go clear the driveway, snowing hard outside. Hope to catch the stream after. Later all!

[0:37:35] <@Solidus_113> You gotta be real though
[0:37:38] <%Jetzord> Have you seen the announcement for Captain Tsubasa's new game and separately, do you think there's a market for these kinds of games since there's more sports anime with anime bullshit in them?
[0:37:42] <+agumon9000> What was the last story beat they did:
[0:37:42] <+primax104> yeah, which chapter is woolie at?

[0:40:00] <@SoushinSen> Indivisible is obviously the most fun game Reggie never played
[0:40:03] <@Solidus_113> Reggie has to be the gamemaster for something he likes and can show off
[0:40:06] <+primax104> Bayo 2 let's go!
[0:40:13] <jase__x> What game you wanna rock Reggie?

[0:51:12] <%GeneralSCPatton> We talking bout' La Brava? She's the best shortstack, aside from Midna.
[0:51:14] <+Mkingston> How many parents are using those baby chest holders imagining they are in Death Stranding?
[0:51:15] <+karldeck> @SoushinSen I need to rewatch it and then watch the Movie on Netflix

[0:53:47] <kingafricaxiv> how we diggin this?
[0:53:53] <+ggbhtg> I have to go now, my Twitter needs me
[0:54:06] <%blaggablag> @WoolieVersus Did you find any of the fat bts that drop a bunch of chiral cristals?
[0:54:24] <+MoralCompassGaming> Is the music still getting instant claimed on YT?
[0:54:35] <DesertPenguin> yea
[0:54:44] <%gatorafan> FeelsBadMan
[0:54:49] <@Solidus_113> If you don't like your own posts you're a coward who doesn't believe in yourself
[0:55:03] <%DesertPenguin> Why does Woolie's LP get copyright issues when Pat's didn't? What are they doing differently?
[0:55:13] <+VidulaSaix> $100 dollarydoos PogChamp
[0:55:26] <+MoralCompassGaming> Pat doesn't care iirc,Pat's channel is jsutan archive
[0:55:27] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1219688583491092483?s=19
[0:55:31] <%gatorafan> Instead of reflecting on myself, I'd rather blame the beasts daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:55:41] <AxelCezar> oh boy i do love when my favored companies censor themselves for fear of twitter mobs, like Ion Fury!! Yay Pat! bouphePog
[0:55:42] <+Razputin217> quiettCash quiettCash quiettCash
[0:55:52] <%DesertPenguin> So YouTube knows it's an archive and treats it differently? This internet is so confusing lol
[0:56:04] <+VidulaSaix> No, he just doesnt care so he puts the videos up
[0:56:07] <+VidulaSaix> And doesnt bother editing them
[0:56:11] <+MoralCompassGaming> But Woolie would like to monetize the video since it's his job, so the music getting claimed stops that
[0:56:13] <%DesertPenguin> But his don't get muted audio
[0:56:17] <%DesertPenguin> Ah I see
[0:56:19] <+VidulaSaix> Neither does Woolies
[0:56:21] <+VidulaSaix> Minh does that
[0:56:24] <+VidulaSaix> So it doesnt get claimed
[0:56:34] <%DesertPenguin> Pat's not making money on it so the music can play
[0:56:41] <+VidulaSaix> Yes
[0:56:49] <+MoralCompassGaming> exactly
[0:56:49] <%DesertPenguin> it's all so obvious now thanks
[0:56:59] <TheLaw3D4> When I see the number I remember that the most important person in my life liked it. @WoolieVersus
[0:57:07] <%blaggablag> Maybe they can get em off the beach?
[0:57:08] <%DesertPenguin> It's nice having less in chat so we can actually hold a conversation :)
[0:57:12] <Avionn> depends on what antibiotics theyre exposed to in the timefall
[0:57:13] <+linSP> reggie is a modern philospher
[0:57:20] <+Mkingston> Antibiotics are expensive and Gamecube games are still $60
[0:57:31] <Avionn> they could regress because of the accelerated generations of the timefall
[0:57:41] <%GeneralSCPatton> Timefall should make wild bacteria fast evolve and lose their resistance
[0:57:46] <hardcore_violence> hey bro sent $100 would be cool if you could read the message. much love!
[0:57:52] <Solidnick18> C
[0:57:53] <+slunkymcgee> Do you think clothing designers have to reverse the normal advertisement-gimmicks in the Death Stranding universe? "1,000% NON-biodegradable, industrial plastics last a billion years!"
[0:58:05] <+Mkingston> David Harbour?
[0:58:24] <+VidulaSaix> He's not reading messages right now hardcore
[0:58:27] <%DesertPenguin> No, YOU go to the doctor.
[0:58:29] <+VidulaSaix> This is recording for Youtube
[0:58:32] <+VidulaSaix> He will afterwards
[0:58:36] <hardcore_violence> ahh ok!
[0:58:41] <+MoralCompassGaming> @hardcore_violence gonna have to wait until a break, Woolie and Cast don't acknowledge the chat while recording for LPs
[0:58:58] <Avionn> with air!
[0:59:02] <TheLaw3D4> But can we pee on the pregnant woman
[0:59:10] <+VidulaSaix> S P E E D
[0:59:13] <+linSP> DOUBLE KILL
[0:59:22] <BearSawed> remember when recording chat is an eye, not an I
[0:59:23] <%gatorafan> S p e e e e e e e woolieCHAN_HF
[0:59:28] <+drfaustisdead> LP purity must be preserved.
[0:59:31] <+primax104> zip on through boys
[0:59:48] <+slunkymcgee> "Sorry for your loss. Sign here and throw her in the back of the truck."
[1:00:01] <+Mkingston> This game won't let you kill an unborn baby...oh wait
[1:00:12] <%blaggablag> "You can still deliver the cargo but you will feel worse for it"
[1:00:17] <BearSawed> too much of a risk, burn it all
[1:00:22] <zayasu> when's dbz kakarot :)
[1:00:26] <%DesertPenguin> I'd really love to see Woolie play through Dark Souls 3. It's been long enough since the LP that he probably doesn't have much committed to memory. It will still be fresh.
[1:00:30] <+linSP> you can kill dead baby GHOSTS man this game rules
[1:00:32] <+MoralCompassGaming> I'm now giggling at the idea of Sam dropping off the "Sorry we missed ya!" leaflets
[1:00:38] <+slunkymcgee> "Yeah I know I'm late, are you still gonna tip me likes?"
[1:00:40] <+VidulaSaix> He aint gonna replay a game hes played already
[1:00:45] <+VidulaSaix> Itd be a massive waste of time
[1:00:46] <%DesertPenguin> Woolie didn't play DS3
[1:00:52] <+VidulaSaix> He saw it al
[1:00:53] <%blaggablag> L I K E C I N
[1:01:00] <@Solidus_113> The time limits never really take into account structures built
[1:01:02] <%DesertPenguin> Let him decide for himself maybe?
[1:01:12] <BearSawed> sorry we missed you, cut to sam outside the blast zone. Oops
[1:01:13] <+drfaustisdead> Fun Fact: every time you stealth kill a B.T. they give you a like.
[1:01:15] <+linSP> he does it for the likes
[1:01:20] <TheLaw3D4> @VidulaSaix what game we talking about?
[1:01:24] <+VidulaSaix> I dont think you understand how little time he has Desert LUL
[1:01:26] <+VidulaSaix> DS3
[1:01:35] <red_blaster> I wish Shenmue had ziplines
[1:01:38] <+Mkingston> Pat said Woolie wouldn't put the effort into building a zipline system.
[1:01:40] <%DesertPenguin> Sorry, I didn't realize you were his secretary :P
[1:01:41] <Pappajimbo> teabag the ghosts
[1:01:57] <%DesertPenguin> Ziplines are the shit
[1:01:58] <%Jetzord> So when are we going to get the DS discussion transition into an Uber Eats sponsorship on the podcast
[1:02:08] <+slunkymcgee> "I'm sorry for your loss." Sam says, trying to look dignified and mournful in his otter hood
[1:02:10] <+VidulaSaix> What shits me is people sayign Ziplines ruin the game
[1:02:13] <TheLaw3D4> Also I do indeed have zero idea how much time woolie does or doesn't have
[1:02:17] <+VidulaSaix> When they super dont. You still have to put in the work
[1:02:30] <+VidulaSaix> And they have a hard limit
[1:02:31] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:02:37] <arkv01> so this is how you have hoes in every zipcode...
[1:02:39] <+VidulaSaix> No different than roads really
[1:02:41] <TheLaw3D4> Ziplines ruin the game
[1:02:46] <Tucker0603> is that the armor plates on his shoulders?
[1:02:47] <%gatorafan> Zzzzoooooooom daedra1DrunkTibs
[1:02:51] <red_blaster> Ziplines ARE the game
[1:02:58] <TheLaw3D4> Then it's a bad game
[1:03:06] <%DesertPenguin> Not really but okay
[1:03:27] <+VidulaSaix> Exactly Woolie
[1:03:27] <%DesertPenguin> It's a single gameplay mechanic. It doesn't make or break anything.
[1:03:38] <+Mkingston> Ziplines are great and so is the game.
[1:03:41] <TheLaw3D4> It's a single gameplay mechanic that makes the game worse
[1:03:42] <ReelDeath> git gud doc
[1:03:44] <+MoralCompassGaming> Nah, you just don't liek the game is all. You not liking a thing doesn't make it bad.
[1:03:48] <+VidulaSaix> ^
[1:03:54] <fruit_pie_the_magician> You have to work your balls off to put up those ziplines.
[1:04:11] <%DesertPenguin> Yea, clearly you have it set in your head that your opinion is established. That's okay, but it's only your opinion. Don't speak in general terms
[1:04:19] <TheLaw3D4> @MoralCompassGaming You liking the game doesn't make it good.
[1:04:25] <%DesertPenguin> Dude....
[1:04:30] <TheLaw3D4> Bro
[1:04:35] <%DesertPenguin> Guy
[1:04:35] <fruit_pie_the_magician> And then every time you use them, you remember the bitch of a time you had putting them up, and you're like "yeah, fuck you, terrain"
[1:04:37] <+linSP> can you bio print bio broly
[1:04:41] <+VidulaSaix> Every DS stream has "that guy"
[1:04:43] <+VidulaSaix> Just ignore them LUL
[1:04:44] <%gatorafan> Ziplines seems to be for the people who grind on RPGs and stomp every story fight daedra1DerpyTibs
[1:04:50] <%DesertPenguin> Yea it's like GFAQs all over again
[1:04:54] <DaikiWithDaShot> Disliking the game don't make it bad just sayin
[1:04:56] <+slunkymcgee> We're gonna 3D print you a new mother
[1:04:59] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @ivansonic08
[1:05:00] <+MoralCompassGaming> I don't feel one way or the other. i haven't bought it. i do however work in the industry, i don't like everything that crosses my desk but those games are often still well made.
[1:05:03] <BearSawed> I'm sure all the people who think theyre broken didnt ever use them, Kappa
[1:05:06] <DaikiWithDaShot> Ziplines are heavenly
[1:05:17] <+ivansonic08> That fucker looks like the president of mexico
[1:05:23] <+MoralCompassGaming> You're jsut salty that your truth isn't the worlds truth.
[1:05:30] <%DesertPenguin> Oh no he's interacting with chat!!!
[1:05:36] <+VidulaSaix> Put in the work, get rewarded for it
[1:05:38] <+VidulaSaix> Exactly
[1:05:40] <%gatorafan> shhhh YouTube doesn't know
[1:05:43] <%DesertPenguin> It's a reward , EXACTLY
[1:05:50] <%DesertPenguin> Just like roads
[1:05:50] <+Mkingston> Woolie speaks truth
[1:06:02] <+linSP> it aint much but its honest work
[1:06:10] <Johker> "It ruins the game." -People who have not played the game
[1:06:19] <%DesertPenguin> So this is you crushing an earlier area with stronger tools
[1:06:21] <+MoralCompassGaming> Ziplines are the same as overleveling in RPGs.
[1:06:25] <Solidnick18> i agree woolie
[1:06:25] <%GeneralSCPatton> He's speaking the language of gods
[1:06:27] <+VidulaSaix> And it's not like you can put them everywhere. You literally have a hard limit, which you have to work more to increase that limit
[1:06:37] <%DesertPenguin> Woolie, you're wording this perfectly, good job
[1:06:50] <arkv01> is the game volume overpowering them?
[1:06:50] <TheLaw3D4> @MoralCompassGaming I'm willing to repectfully disagree sadly wants happening is just people trying to scream "You're wrong, that's just your opinion"
[1:06:52] <+linSP> spoken like a true playtester
[1:06:59] <%DesertPenguin> Zip lines are a little loud arkv01
[1:07:10] <arkv01> ziplines rip commentary
[1:07:11] <+VidulaSaix> Woolie is telling you on stream right now why you're wrong Law
[1:07:15] <+slunkymcgee> handbags down ladies
[1:07:18] <TheLaw3D4> I disagree with him
[1:07:19] <+VidulaSaix> We've also been saying it in chat
[1:07:23] <+VidulaSaix> You just refuse to listen to it
[1:07:27] <%DesertPenguin> BEcause it is your opinion and it's wrong compared to everyone else here @TheLaw3D4
[1:07:34] <arkv01> its a scenic teleporter
[1:07:35] <+MoralCompassGaming> That's entirely what is happening. You are saying it's bad because YOU feel it's bad. it's a mechanic use it or don't don't try to force your way on others. you're being a child.
[1:07:37] <%DesertPenguin> It's not wrong in general, just compared to everyone here
[1:08:05] <+slunkymcgee> Can we just agree to disagree and get back to watching videogames
[1:08:12] <TheLaw3D4> I think that it's a terrible. release that doesn't make you feel like your interacting the game while overpowered
[1:08:19] <%DesertPenguin> @Slunkymcgee Probably not
[1:08:26] <DaikiWithDaShot> The main thing is ziplines aren't required. If you don't like them then you have the choice to play the game that way
[1:08:29] <+VidulaSaix> So something that you get like 30+ hours into the game makes the entire game bad.
[1:08:31] <+VidulaSaix> Got it LUL
[1:08:40] <%DesertPenguin> That's like saying bonfire warping in DS1 is bad
[1:08:47] <%DesertPenguin> exact same thing
[1:08:52] <TheLaw3D4> Having an op way to traverse would be a good release, just flying over the whole level is weak
[1:08:53] <%gatorafan> Also, I bet ziplines get you mad likes.
[1:08:54] <%DesertPenguin> And therefore all of DS1 is bad
[1:08:54] <+MoralCompassGaming> Let's try this another way. The Ziplines are gone but you get an exosuit that blows up any BT that touches you. Is this better or worse?
[1:09:08] <+drfaustisdead> I was showing off the game to a friend the other weekend, and he asked me how much time my zipline network saved. I told him it was the equivalent of 3 hours of on foot travel.
[1:09:12] <%gatorafan> We need those likes, gib likes daedra1DrunkTibs
[1:09:18] <+Mkingston> attention seeker
[1:09:24] <Hexer_The_Hacker> Ya'll trying to convince a dude who cannot be convinced, lmfao, move along
[1:09:28] <+VidulaSaix> Agreed
[1:09:30] <+primax104> good job
[1:09:39] <BearSawed> perfect balance of any elements in videogames will never exsist, if you dont like an element then challenge yourself to not use it, but dont damn anyone else for using it.
[1:09:42] <+slunkymcgee> "Okay, so I've got an invoice for a uh.... home euthenasia kit. Sign here."
[1:09:45] <DaikiWithDaShot> @thelaw3d4 That's literally what it is, it's an OP travel mechanic. I don't see how it's different from whatever other OP traversal you'd be looking for
[1:09:46] <TheLaw3D4> @MoralCompassGaming An exosuit would be a better option, one that greatly enhances movement
[1:09:51] <+Mkingston> Time for that sweet new equipment
[1:09:54] <%DesertPenguin> I'm not trying to convince him, just using logic, but he wants to keep bringing it up like it's an argument
[1:09:58] <+MoralCompassGaming> That's not what i said.
[1:10:03] <+Hippineapple228> Hippineapple228 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:10:04] <red_blaster> Planning a ziplines route and doing the work setting them up is the most fun I had with a game in a while, I found the process really interesting
[1:10:05] <theevilhex> nice golden hat
[1:10:20] <TheLaw3D4> @DaikiWithDaShot I a strong exosuit is still a lot more invoved that fast travel
[1:10:20] <Hexer_The_Hacker> Big ol' bag of fuckit
[1:10:20] <arkv01> just don't take russian flesh eating meth
[1:10:26] <%DesertPenguin> @TheLaw3D4 Yes or No, Have you played this game?
[1:10:37] <Pappajimbo> well they are optional so people dont need to use them if they dont want to. and the rest of us will slap our balls on them as we zipline past
[1:10:38] <TheLaw3D4> I've beaten it
[1:10:40] <%gatorafan> Man
[1:10:40] <Solidnick18> lol
[1:10:43] <Hexer_The_Hacker> LMAO
[1:10:43] <+linSP> yay woolie finally ended a mission with a mom NOT dying
[1:10:46] <DaikiWithDaShot> @thelaw3d4 I mean you have the speed skeleton, just use that. Ziplines aren't necessary if you yourself don't want them ya know?
[1:10:46] <%DesertPenguin> Why did you keep playing it if it's so bad?
[1:10:55] <arkv01> The Videotron Guy
[1:10:55] <%gatorafan> yeah, this got a little real to me
[1:10:59] <+VidulaSaix> I dont thkink he has, because he referenced the Speed Skeleton like it was something that didnt exist in the game LUL
[1:11:00] <TheLaw3D4> I don't think this is a bad game
[1:11:05] <%DesertPenguin> Because you're a troll. Just stop poking the bear. We get it. You disagree. Move along.
[1:11:10] <%DesertPenguin> WOW just stop dude
[1:11:12] <BearSawed> but being involved doesnt immediately equal quality
[1:11:14] <+MoralCompassGaming> I suggested another upgrade that trivializes the game in a similar way in that the orginal threat is now killing itself touching you. Is that better than zipping around?
[1:11:14] <TheLaw3D4> Someone jokingly said, "Ziplines are the game"
[1:11:17] <+VidulaSaix> Yeah, dude's a clown. time to move on
[1:11:19] <Solidnick18> become a superstar or whatever that was
[1:11:20] <arkv01> isn't videotron and bell the only choices you guys have?
[1:11:21] <TheLaw3D4> I joked by saying then it's a bad game
[1:11:26] <%DesertPenguin> Can I ignore a user so their chat doesn'ts how up?
[1:11:34] <theevilhex> this dude can't even leave his bunker for the face to face
[1:11:35] <@Solidus_113> GOOD SHIT GLOVES
[1:11:37] <%DesertPenguin> Oh, so now you were just joking. Right
[1:11:38] <+Mkingston> Wolverine gloves
[1:11:39] <+VidulaSaix> This guy looks like Rip Torn LUL
[1:11:41] <Hexer_The_Hacker> powah glove is powah love
[1:11:43] <Zeldrick> Those gloves are SO GOOD
[1:11:44] <+slunkymcgee> Slavsuit unlocked: Sam's suit now has Adidas stripes
[1:11:46] <Solidnick18> Power gloves are awesome
[1:11:46] <Graxe_> You can also turn off other people's creations. can't you? So then you would have to force yourself to build your own zipline network since you can't rely on others' ziplines.
[1:11:50] <%DesertPenguin> Gloves feel nice
[1:11:50] <theevilhex> mmmmm ketamine
[1:12:03] <TheLaw3D4> @DesertPenguin I was joking that the whole game is bad, I genuinely think ziplines are bad.
[1:12:08] <+linSP> feel the power woolie
[1:12:09] <+VidulaSaix> Technology PogChamp
[1:12:11] <%DesertPenguin> I don't care anymore. Move on
[1:12:14] <%gatorafan> Does Sam need to see this?
[1:12:20] <theevilhex> lmao what
[1:12:26] <+VidulaSaix> No shut up though gator
[1:12:27] <+Mkingston> I can sleep with you wife via your robot. Is it cheating?

[1:13:11] <+slunkymcgee> "Thank you SO MUCH Sam. One and a half stars."
[1:13:15] <BearSawed> because you need to see this fantastic dialogue koji san wrote for you
[1:13:29] <theevilhex> everyone's here
[1:13:30] <TheLaw3D4> @MoralCompassGaming I think it's better, since your option still has way more challenge than ziplines
[1:13:32] <+VidulaSaix> Maybe he doesn't creep on you like Sam creeps on his clients LUL
[1:13:33] <arkv01> preggo kai waifu

[1:15:57] <@Solidus_113> MGS5 6 Million Dollar man punch
[1:16:01] <+drfaustisdead> No
[1:16:01] <QaizerArt> FUCK no
[1:16:08] <+slunkymcgee> You punch a MULE so hard a BT flies out of their body
[1:16:12] <Solidnick18> chiral boots are the top tier
[1:16:13] <donstylo> Woolie is One Punch Man now
[1:16:18] <%DesertPenguin> If only it made the Million Dollar Man punch SFX like in MGS5
[1:16:21] <QaizerArt> Chiral ANYTHING is better than the standard
[1:16:26] <+VidulaSaix> He'll do a punch like The Ancient One in Dr Strange LUL
[1:16:26] <Pappajimbo> you wa shock
[1:16:31] <Solidnick18> bridge boots level 3 are good for a spare tho
[1:16:38] <$laphyrion> What are you talking about, they're the best option! ....if you don't have Chiral Boots.
[1:16:46] <%DesertPenguin> That would be something
[1:16:55] <Pappajimbo> his guns are wrecked
[1:17:32] <Hexer_The_Hacker> Loved the design of the stabilizer, but never used it after trying it out once
[1:17:36] <+drfaustisdead> I refused to use the stabilizer because it took the entire backpack.
[1:17:41] <Hexer_The_Hacker> ^
[1:18:07] <%Irridium> never used the stabalizer. Blood and grenade pouches were just too useful
[1:18:14] <%gatorafan> punch the BTs wooliePOYO
[1:18:16] <+linSP> go full offense backpack build, only grenade pouches
[1:18:26] <QaizerArt> Yeah with @drfaustisdead on that. I ran one util pouch, 4 grenade pouches and the battery.
[1:18:29] <Hexer_The_Hacker> Punch the BT's with your shit-covered power glove
[1:18:30] <+D00msDayDan> It’s suuuper not worth losing free grenade storage
[1:18:31] <+MoralCompassGaming> Eyyy i have an interview with Ubisoft
[1:18:44] <TheLaw3D4> Shove your shit down a BT's throat
[1:18:46] <Hexer_The_Hacker> Ooo congrats
[1:18:50] <QaizerArt> Grenade pouches are super useful to take out the shit-tier BTs
[1:18:54] <%Jetzord> Congrats man!
[1:18:57] <QaizerArt> And yeah, congrats @MoralCompassGaming
[1:19:01] <+slunkymcgee> Endgame unlock: Belt-fed machinegun hooked up to a colostomy bag
[1:19:09] <%gatorafan> Triple aaaaayyyyy interview, congrats
[1:19:11] <Solidnick18> @MoralCompassGaming congrats. that's pretty cool
[1:19:20] <+MoralCompassGaming> Thanks! 6 years in the QA trenches looks to be paying off haha
[1:19:24] <+drfaustisdead> @QaizerArt I ran with 2 large grenades, 2 small, and battery.
[1:19:42] <QaizerArt> Wait where do you get large grenade pouches @drfaustisdead
[1:19:42] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1219688583491092483?s=19
[1:19:53] <Solidnick18> power gloves FeelsGoodMan
[1:19:53] <QaizerArt> I only ever had the small ones.
[1:20:01] <+VidulaSaix> I did LUL
[1:20:01] <DaikiWithDaShot> @slunkymcgee that's strong
[1:20:13] <nubreakable> Hey guys, how far ahead of the lp is this
[1:20:22] <+drfaustisdead> @QaizerArt I can't remember I was a crazy person who wouldn't progress until I five starred everyone in a chapter.
[1:20:35] <Hexer_The_Hacker> ^Thats how ya do it
[1:20:59] <QaizerArt> Shame the game hardlocks some preppers that you can't increase their progress til further in the story, @drfaustisdead
[1:21:00] <Hexer_The_Hacker> I think one of the main depo centers gives you the upgrades..?
[1:21:11] <NewtypeRonin> Ziplines, the game :O
[1:21:16] <@Solidus_113> If you can see that little white notch on the battery meter, everything that extends past that is your backpack battery @WoolieVersus It's always great to have
[1:21:19] <%gatorafan> oh boy
[1:21:31] <TheLaw3D4> Roads and Ziplines make this a doable LP timewise. I just had fun using actual movement with skeletons and offroad vehicles.
[1:22:13] <QaizerArt> wait a minute, it's the cosplayer that gives the large pouch. wtf, i 5-starred her.
[1:22:13] <+linSP> ziplines made this game 100%-able in a decent amount of time
[1:22:19] <nubreakable> !uptime
[1:22:20] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 30 minutes
[1:22:26] <Hexer_The_Hacker> My server preferred road based travel, so our ziplines are only in the mountains and a single one for the main road to the old man
[1:22:28] <NewtypeRonin> haha
[1:22:42] <HauntedTheVagabond> Primetime Woolie
[1:22:45] <NewtypeRonin> this man said Deion Sanders. PogChamp
[1:22:56] <TheLaw3D4> I wanted to just turn off all the player stuff but some of it is cool
[1:23:16] <+drfaustisdead> @QaizerArt according to my research it unlocks after doing delivery 37 for the cosplayer and hitting 5 stars with her.
[1:23:25] <+primax104> wow
[1:23:40] <+linSP> oh noooo
[1:23:42] <Hexer_The_Hacker> ! D E S T R O Y E D !
[1:23:43] <NewtypeRonin> that kid turned that girls ankles into water lmao
[1:23:44] <HauntedTheVagabond> broken ankles for DAYS
[1:24:06] <+Mkingston> Now I want to see that video
[1:24:18] <BoneBagMel> how can I look up this vid
[1:24:24] <razieltano123> Its the Cole Train BaBy
[1:24:28] <TheLaw3D4> She got Akashi'd
[1:25:03] <%gatorafan> Ride with Norman Reedus CoolCat
[1:25:13] <%DesertPenguin> Why does this road curve so much when it can just go straight over everything wtf
[1:25:30] <BoneBagMel> so it's not boring, I guess
[1:25:30] <HauntedTheVagabond> VC
[1:25:36] <%DesertPenguin> Good American Infrastructure. Never makes sense lol
[1:25:36] <NewtypeRonin> would you say it's an S-Curve....or maybe a S-trand Kappa
[1:25:50] <+drfaustisdead> So you have to actually pay attention while driving.
[1:25:51] <+Jake_Protagonist> Because the game is about balancing. Curves make you have to balance the vehicles and manage your speed. Im assuming anyway
[1:25:51] <BoneBagMel> Ok I'm leaving Ronin
[1:25:53] <TheLaw3D4> Can't make skipping the gameplay too boring
[1:25:54] <BoneBagMel> thanks for that
[1:26:07] <+joliorn> joliorn subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:26:12] <DaBigVitus> so how many parts would you guess until this series is done on youtube do you guys think?
[1:26:19] <%DesertPenguin> Another 40 lol
[1:26:24] <@Solidus_113> ^
[1:26:25] <+BionoidLCR> i think Fang from primal could ball if she wanted to
[1:26:34] <NewtypeRonin> @BoneBagMel LUL
[1:26:57] <Hexer_The_Hacker> Wholesome territory
[1:27:04] <+Jake_Protagonist> wholesome huh
[1:27:08] <TheLaw3D4> Whatever get's us off the road is a good idea
[1:27:17] <razieltano123> You lie, Woolie. Those American-Canadian commercial can't be real.
[1:27:28] <DaikiWithDaShot> @thelaw3d4 Still gotta spend time getting the materials and getting to the right area to build them. imo that more than makes up for the "skipping" you do later
[1:27:28] <%DesertPenguin> Is there a rest stop nearby? Could really use a Post-Apocalyptic Denny's
[1:27:29] <DaBigVitus> @DesertPenguin oh lawd. alright thanks LUL
[1:27:47] <DaikiWithDaShot> Also there's still missions where you can't even use a zipline to get to your destination
[1:27:58] <+VidulaSaix> Lou FeelsBadMan
[1:28:05] <DaikiWithDaShot> And missions where you have no choice but to get off the road
[1:28:08] <+Mkingston> Empty Nest Syndrome
[1:28:16] <%gatorafan> I have not been watching Woolie play this so I have yet to see a terrorist daedra1DerpyTibs
[1:28:28] <QaizerArt> @drfaustisdead That's weird, Polygon's chart has the Lg. Grenade pouch at 3 stars
[1:28:29] <%gatorafan> I mean I have only been watching Woolie
[1:28:32] <+linSP> get a puppy sam
[1:28:33] <%DesertPenguin> Has the game talked about Sam's past yet? I don't wanna say something and spoil them
[1:28:35] <TheLaw3D4> Yep, and there are missions where you don't @DaikiWithDaShot It's fine, don't worry about it
[1:28:41] <QaizerArt> Her level 5 is a backpack color.
[1:28:54] <%DesertPenguin> They don't know about Sam's pregnant wife that died?
[1:29:19] <+drfaustisdead> did anyone ever do the terroist zone scumbag move of slapping lv. 4 armor plates on and dropping a generator next to yourself.
[1:29:22] <razieltano123> @DesertPenguin Spoilers dude.
[1:29:22] <%DesertPenguin> They're not actively reading chat so it's safe
[1:29:24] <+Mkingston> @DesertPenguin really?
[1:29:32] <derap41> ....This a porno
[1:29:33] <+Mkingston> Yes they are
[1:29:33] <QaizerArt> Solidus pls delete what DesertPenguin said
[1:29:35] <+drfaustisdead> @QaizerArt might have been a mistake.
[1:29:37] <+VidulaSaix> They are but its not addressed
[1:29:38] <%DesertPenguin> Yea delete it my bad
[1:29:41] <+VidulaSaix> So please dont spoil
[1:29:42] <DaikiWithDaShot> @thelaw3d4 Idk sounded like your issue was that the whole game is like that. Weird way of arguing
[1:29:46] <QaizerArt> @Solidus_113
[1:29:49] <%gatorafan> @desertpenguin they are, they are just not acknowledging it
[1:29:49] <+drfaustisdead> @QaizerArt on my part that is.
[1:29:51] <%DesertPenguin> Forgot people in here are watching for the first time
[1:29:56] <arkv01> this lady sounded a lil lewd...
[1:30:05] <%DesertPenguin> So that thing... lol
[1:30:16] <DaikiWithDaShot> I can't wait for Heartboy
[1:30:17] <$cureneckbeard> forgot not to spoil a game while watching a playthrough of that game nyannAngry
[1:30:21] <+linSP> look at this photographer
[1:30:27] <Pappajimbo> sam gets it to 5 stars with all the ladies
[1:30:31] <+drfaustisdead> The photographer's mother is my favorite model in the entire game.
[1:30:49] <%DesertPenguin> I wanna see more Heartman, his scenes are great
[1:30:51] <TheLaw3D4> I just don't get people who spoil games on twitch.
[1:31:04] <QaizerArt> @akuda_bar could you delete the post from @DesertPenguin about Sam's wife from earlier. It's spoils.
[1:31:16] <%DesertPenguin> I think it's scrolled up enough that no one will see it now
[1:31:24] <QaizerArt> @DesertPenguin VODs, dude
[1:31:35] <$cureneckbeard> how can people know how smart I am if I don't tell them things I only know because I already watched Pat play this part
[1:31:36] <razieltano123> Is she a famous director or something for Kojima to put here here?
[1:32:04] <+linSP> lock and load woolie
[1:32:04] <+primax104> yup

[1:33:38] <%gatorafan> Only for riots

[1:34:34] <+linSP> smoke is good , it makes you invisible for a few seconds

[1:35:57] <@Solidus_113> Here come the angry bond fans
[1:36:00] <arkv01> skyfall is a dumb anime
[1:36:26] <donstylo> Punch Time
[1:36:32] <razieltano123> @arkv01 So just anime
[1:36:37] <%Lion_kun> Casino Royale is by far the best one, Quantum of Solace was mediocre, Skywall was fine but flawed, Spectre fucking sucked.
[1:36:39] <arkv01> yess

[1:36:58] <arkv01> woolies always raring to swing first
[1:37:13] <%LordSDB> I actually thought woolie was talking about the game Cuisine royal at first
[1:37:15] <+linSP> theres many approaches, you could lift the package off them with a sticky gun
[1:37:37] <+GarbageNirvana> I'ma be real, I completely forgot the sticky gun existed the moment they gave it to me
[1:37:43] <+primax104> high ground
[1:37:49] <+VidulaSaix> Oh lawd they comin
[1:37:53] <+Mkingston> Go time
[1:37:59] <%DesertPenguin> blat blat blat

[1:38:53] <arkv01> never expose yourself in a combat zone
[1:39:18] <+VidulaSaix> I sink like a rock when i try that shit LUL
[1:39:20] <+linSP> everyone tryna kill woolie while him using non-lethal, pretty sure this is just undertale
[1:39:27] <+Mkingston> It's almost like this was meant to be a stealth mission
[1:39:28] <%DesertPenguin> non-lethal ammo right?
[1:39:33] <+Mkingston> We all float down here
[1:39:34] <derap41> Keeping Air in the lungs mean you will float

[1:43:19] <ManlyMcBeefington> quick music segment
[1:43:28] <arkv01> hello sir, I've got your... 50 packets of ky jelly?
[1:44:06] <razieltano123> @WoolieVersus Those gloves WILL kill someone. It's a 1 in 50 chance for death.
[1:44:10] <arkv01> cmon kid the usb key is clean, I used alcohol
[1:44:33] <arkv01> aol is the final arc of sword art
[1:44:33] <@SoushinSen> @alrobot2014 Yeah it has tank drifting. you even get something called "Drifting Destruction" if you destroy a tank while drifting.

[1:45:31] <+VidulaSaix> They knew LUL
[1:45:39] <arkv01> man I hope this floating segment isn't norman getting irradiated and becoming sterile
[1:45:43] <+slunkymcgee> All the photos are gone and replaced with blurry close-ups of Sam's face
[1:45:47] <derap41> The claws are decorative they're not for slaping someone silly
[1:45:57] <+GarbageNirvana> They totally do tho
[1:45:57] <%wujak> it knocked that dude back pretty far. maybe you need to be careful of punching people off cliffs
[1:46:02] <+VidulaSaix> To be fair they live near terrorist
[1:46:03] <derap41> Weird amount of guns in this game
[1:46:04] <+VidulaSaix> So LUL
[1:46:08] <+primax104> picture of a design
[1:46:15] <razieltano123> @WoolieVersus Those gloves WILL kill someone. It's a 1 in 50 chance for death if you punch them.

[1:46:27] <Shirk_Diggler> Her mom will never have anything to say ever
[1:46:31] <Shirk_Diggler> Until by messenger
[1:46:53] <+MoralCompassGaming> Killing in a world where dead bodies are nukes is a bad way to solve the problem
[1:47:00] <+VidulaSaix> Lore PogChamp
[1:47:09] <arkv01> @MoralCompassGaming yeah but this is america, people'll do it anyways
[1:47:52] <Shirk_Diggler> Not America anymore, just people being people. Not a cellphone in sight.
[1:47:52] <+MoralCompassGaming> if they can hit a target a few kilometers away have fun i guess lol. a Barett 50. cal could do it
[1:48:05] <+VidulaSaix> I cant fucking wait for Heartman
[1:48:36] <arkv01> heartman sustains his latency with his love
[1:48:40] <arkv01> no red bars there
[1:48:49] <This_is_Marco> DansGame my bb deadman not yours
[1:48:51] <+MoralCompassGaming> I haven't seen any of the heartman stuff, jsut heard about him
[1:48:52] <%Jetzord> @MoralCompassGaming or we can return to medieval warfare and use trebuchets to launch corpses at our enemies
[1:49:01] <nontagonist> Yo word up Wools, big fan of the podcast(s) and this playthrough, been enjoying it on youtube, had to bail out partway through because I was sure there was something I needed to see for myself after that second pizza delivery. Anyway, good job on the playthrough thus far.
[1:49:23] <+MoralCompassGaming> get fucked LUL
[1:49:25] <foreverN2dust> NotLikeThis
[1:49:28] <+primax104> it happens
[1:49:29] <+VidulaSaix> He just said go to Mountaineer I think
[1:49:30] <QaizerArt> The Death Stranding was the friends we made along the way
[1:50:04] <WhoInvitedZach> How's it goin, fellas?

[1:50:10] <+VidulaSaix> Near dentals
[1:50:25] <razieltano123> The BIg Five are watching you doing sick jumps.
[1:50:30] <arkv01> karma stranding
[1:50:37] <+MoralCompassGaming> @Jetzord would require keeping people alive until we need a corpse. Can't just have a stockpile of bodies when they explode when left alone
[1:50:40] <lotharrio> Well we didn't just wipe them out. We also interbred with them.
[1:50:42] <+primax104> woolie this isn't Parasite Eve :P
[1:50:42] <This_is_Marco> neanderthals did it to themselves
[1:50:48] <seycheles> monkaS
[1:50:48] <derap41> Woolie we interbreed them not wiped them out
[1:50:50] <%supersugoisenpai1> Race war starts now?
[1:50:51] <+VidulaSaix> LUL
[1:50:57] <+VidulaSaix> You tried, Reggie
[1:50:58] <+Caped_Eggy> It's natural selection
[1:51:00] <This_is_Marco> we had tools and wore animal skins so we won the race war
[1:51:08] <Prevot> we fucked them all to death
[1:51:22] <lotharrio> Sapiens Sapiens were better at sex, so the neanderthals cucked themselves to death.
[1:51:23] <%GeneralSCPatton> The race ware was resolved with interracial waifus
[1:51:45] <razieltano123> @WoolieVersus We interbred with the. I.E. We fucked them to death.
[1:51:48] <alrobot2014> if only that solution worked with all wars
[1:51:56] <morcego_cinzento_arts> We killed the neanderthals....with snu snu!
[1:52:01] <+primax104> Mama
[1:52:01] <spardanwarrior> My brain autocorrected what Reggie was saying into Nyanderthals and now I can't stop thinking of saber-toothed catgirls

[1:56:54] <+linSP> great job! enjoy your dollar tip
[1:57:01] <razieltano123> @WoolieVersus You need specific items to get the five stars with this guy.
[1:57:31] <Graxe_> More power
[1:57:31] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:58:04] <foreverN2dust> My dad works at KojiPro :)
[1:58:27] <@Solidus_113> I'm not seeing anything about that on the wiki. It's probably bullshit
[1:58:39] <QaizerArt> @foreverN2dust can you ask him to put norman reedus and his funky fetus in smash
[1:58:40] <+VidulaSaix> Then again, it's a Kojima game
[1:58:43] <+VidulaSaix> It might be true
[1:59:17] <+VidulaSaix> FeelsBadMan
[1:59:23] <@Solidus_113> FeelsBadMan
[1:59:31] <+linSP> FeelsBadMan
[1:59:36] <+VidulaSaix> Ah yeah the frostbite shit is gnarly
[2:00:16] <+VidulaSaix> I think frostbite on your feet makes your balance worse as well but cant confirm that
[2:00:33] <Solidus_113> If you run around with no boots your feet will also get bloody and you'll get a cutscene where Sam pulls off his toenails
[2:00:41] <QaizerArt> oh my god what
[2:00:49] <@Solidus_113> it's bad
[2:00:55] <QaizerArt> oh jesus
[2:01:00] <QaizerArt> i'm so glad i never tried that
[2:01:00] <%jepupu> Wobbly
[2:01:09] <alrobot2014> wait do you mean the ENTIRE nail?
[2:01:11] <+VidulaSaix> You also piss blood Solidus
[2:01:12] <razieltano123> @Solidus_113 Pat got lucky when he was punching with them and the chat was going crazy.
[2:01:15] <QaizerArt> pulling toenails off is like an instant turn off
[2:01:17] <bevyrage> a roommate of mine had frostbite up past her ankle and her foot was black, but it didn't get deep enough to be cause for an amputation.
[2:01:33] <+GarbageNirvana> Yikes
[2:01:43] <bevyrage> she also had horrible balance because of it too
[2:01:46] <Breakfast_Megapowers> If your toes become Black and hard, just break them off and make them souveniers :)
[2:01:58] <arkv01> ouchhh
[2:02:04] <arkv01> you wander
[2:02:04] <+VidulaSaix> LUL
[2:02:20] <arkv01> everyday was a fight against tetanus
[2:02:30] <+linSP> imagine how thick skinned our feet were before shoes
[2:02:36] <DatAsuna> that's gross, man
[2:02:40] <razieltano123> Woolie, are you a Team Ico protagonist?
[2:02:42] <TheLaw3D4> I still got decently hard feet
[2:02:50] <TheLaw3D4> shoes are for chumps, dominica forever
[2:02:55] <arkv01> feet, huh 👀
[2:03:09] <Prevot> stop talking about feet before Reggie gets a semi
[2:03:16] <+VidulaSaix> In Kojima games especially you can miss a lot of crazy shit by not failing
[2:03:21] <TheLaw3D4> Armpits are hotter tbh
[2:03:39] <@Solidus_113> plan for every occasion
[2:03:45] <Breakfast_Megapowers> thing is Montreal is hard mode, where Glass is the common foray on the ground. Hard feet don't solve that problem unfortunately
[2:03:49] <+linSP> ngl i failed on purpose to see content Kappa
[2:03:58] <+VidulaSaix> Like in this game specifically I want to do a playthrough where I voidout at every possible non-game over instance
[2:04:00] <+VidulaSaix> Just to see
[2:04:03] <@Solidus_113> I do the failing post-game
[2:04:21] <TheLaw3D4> I like games where it's easy to see everything
[2:04:40] <arkv01> ezios mom needs it for her aching feet man
[2:04:41] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:04:46] <+primax104> what a classic
[2:05:13] <TheLaw3D4> Did woolie ever do Astral Chain post game offscreen?
[2:05:29] <razieltano123> @WoolieVersus Ezio's mom doesn't speak. But you do get a sick as cape.
[2:05:30] <+linSP> the forced death at the start shows you the important lore content you otherwise would miss if you played perfectly
[2:05:39] <Pappajimbo> in this game just needs to launch off a cliff full speed to see the Resurrection stuff
[2:05:53] <@Solidus_113> Get this cape you can't use for anything because you already completed all the content
[2:06:04] <+VidulaSaix> I hate when games do that
[2:06:06] <+primax104> or just ride the river to the waterfall
[2:06:17] <+GarbageNirvana> Like at least let us carry that shit over into a new game plus
[2:06:24] <+linSP> dying before you get bb for example, has important lore implications
[2:06:27] <+VidulaSaix> Wait Reggie's never played Snake Eater
[2:06:32] <+VidulaSaix> OH MAN PLEASE LP THAT WITH HIM
[2:06:46] <+donpalta19> TUUUUNN TUUUNUUU TUNTUN
[2:06:47] <razieltano123> @Solidus_113 Just like the Fallout 2 Xp book for post game.
[2:07:06] <@Solidus_113> Snipe The End in his wheelchair
[2:07:07] <Breakfast_Megapowers> The End or the Pain?
[2:07:10] <+VidulaSaix> The End
[2:07:17] <+GarbageNirvana> Just wait him out
[2:07:35] <zayasu> now you just throw grenades at them
[2:07:35] <Breakfast_Megapowers> cause the Pain has a few ways to beat him too
[2:07:36] <+VidulaSaix> I cant unsee this guy as Rip Torn
[2:07:40] <lotharrio> Earlier MGS games having extensive boss strategies was the coolest thing. You know how many ways you can duel Solidus Snake?
[2:07:43] <Sogeki_Dan> Is that Tom Green's dad in Freddy got Fingered?
[2:07:55] <+VidulaSaix> Thats Rip Torn @Sogeki_Dan
[2:08:08] <+linSP> rip Rip FeelsBadMan
[2:08:12] <+donpalta19> Why is this david cage character talking to you
[2:08:12] <+VidulaSaix> FeelsBadMan
[2:08:24] <arkv01> why isn't david cage a hologram in this game
[2:08:33] <Afterman_> travis willingam?
[2:08:37] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Got a little jobbie daddy
[2:08:39] <TheLaw3D4> Games with optional content art great. Games that let you overlook huge game changing mechanics are bad.
[2:08:43] <+GarbageNirvana> Rip Torn was Zed in MIB
[2:08:50] <Pappajimbo> @VidulaSaix if you can doge a wrench you can doge a bt
[2:09:02] <+VidulaSaix> Yep
[2:09:05] <+GarbageNirvana> Probably where most people saw him
[2:09:09] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[2:09:13] <+primax104> is this actually him though?
[2:09:15] <%DesertPenguin> Went out for a bit. Did I miss any story cutscenes?
[2:09:17] <@Solidus_113> it's not
[2:09:27] <+VidulaSaix> Nah Rip died a while ago sadly
[2:09:35] <Afterman_> knew it was travis willingham
[2:09:51] <+primax104> it also looks like an older Travis
[2:10:07] <arkv01> thanks, zed...
[2:10:26] <+VidulaSaix> Damn right
[2:10:31] <+VidulaSaix> MIB movies are so good

[2:10:36] <+VidulaSaix> Even 3 has some good ass shit in it

[2:12:49] <arkv01> I can't get over why woolie puts ribbons on his trash
[2:12:59] <+donpalta19> @Prevot In fact, she is stronger than ever
[2:13:41] <BurdRightsActivist> sp

[2:14:10] <+NeddieSpaghetti> Bro I want gold stuff to lemme guess Side missions?
[2:14:22] <+NeddieSpaghetti> or was that pre order
[2:14:42] <@Solidus_113> gold armour, glasses, and skeletons are exclusive to preorders

[2:16:22] <+primax104> Densetsu no Delivery man!
[2:16:23] <Ashenik1> Would you guys enjoy Woolie doing a playthrough of witcher 3?
[2:16:31] <arkv01> nope
[2:16:38] <+donpalta19> I like Woolie playing through things yes
[2:16:40] <+VidulaSaix> Dont think it's his kinda game tbh
[2:16:44] <+VidulaSaix> But a look would be cool
[2:16:49] <LeeOhX> theres too much in the witcher to do and woolie would do them all
[2:16:53] <+NeddieSpaghetti> Super Sawitch
[2:16:57] <+primax104> but it isn't 2 ppl I think
[2:17:02] <razieltano123> "Make us whole"- Nicole (Dead Space)
[2:17:09] <+donpalta19> Has Pat done witcher?
[2:17:12] <+VidulaSaix> I LOVE TWICE
[2:17:15] <+VidulaSaix> Twice is the fucking sickest
[2:17:19] <Lionkevinson> What it do babyyyyy
[2:17:21] <EndgameContent> Haven't you ever had an internal conundrum? Been faced with a moral quandary?
[2:17:31] <Tucker0603> poor old twice, he's tragic
[2:17:34] <arkv01> not as cool as quad
[2:17:38] <LeeOhX> "Does he fight with himself" ho boy
[2:17:38] <arkv01> QUAD CITY DJS
[2:17:40] <EndgameContent> You already argue with yourself more often than you think.
[2:17:40] <Breakfast_Megapowers> Twice is like Spawn without the cape
[2:18:05] <+primax104> I think it is implied that Lockne and Mama are one whole split into two and then re uinited
[2:18:20] <+VidulaSaix> They were conjoined twins
[2:18:22] <This_is_Marco> DID isnt schizophrenia
[2:18:25] <QaizerArt> Twice is like if Deadpool had a baby with Multiple Man
[2:18:32] <+linSP> that implies twins have split souls
[2:18:33] <EndgameContent> Woolie, imagine if the part of you that likes FGC stuff and the part of you that likes other stuff were originally two different people.
[2:18:41] <EndgameContent> Not super out-there to think about.
[2:19:00] <EndgameContent> Humans are already complex and multi-faceted.

[3:29:56] <dukenux> Watch Hannibal
[3:30:05] <dukenux> no, but do watch Hannibal
[3:30:18] <@Solidus_113> Mads was also the dad in Rogue One
[3:30:24] <Pappajimbo> watch it on chiralflix
[3:30:24] <trulythedude> well thanks for nothing
[3:30:29] <+VidulaSaix> Yeah I'd say focus on the interviews
[3:30:33] <dukenux> "Connect 4 mister Bond? I see you too aren't shy of danger."
[3:30:54] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Mads did a ton of stuff, even one of the Three Musketeers movie
[3:31:14] <%LiterallyTotori> Kojima likes thing, he adds thing. Kinda cool to learn more of his interests
[3:31:23] <%DesertPenguin> Later guys, I'm out
[3:31:30] <Andrei11Droasca> Kojima is like the reverse Sakurai were he shoves everything he likes in his games but only he cares LUL
[3:31:41] <morcego_cinzento_arts> have a good night @DesertPenguin
[3:31:58] <+GarbageNirvana> Diplomacy has failed
[3:32:28] <JDebss> good cop
[3:32:31] <DatAsuna> that's not crazy at all
[3:32:33] <+linSP> i still think back to the time homo demens mightve meant demons
[3:32:37] <DatAsuna> That's standard for anywhere not america
[3:32:59] <+GarbageNirvana> Yeah non-American cops are actually decent

[3:35:05] <Prevot> man wouldn't Japan get wrecked by just a single voidout?
[3:35:33] <derap41> why show when you can tell
[3:35:43] <derap41> tell twice and explain
[3:36:13] <derap41> and by that I mean making the thematic elements of the game clear to the player from verbal comunication
[3:36:22] <%bread_assassin> The Chiral Network and BBS are both American inventions, so the rest of the world is probably super fucked
[3:36:31] <Andrei11Droasca> Wait wat did that mean Reggie?
[3:36:33] <derap41> By that I mean speaking with the player so that they understand the concepts in the games
[3:36:45] <derap41> to clarity I mean telling the player what to think
[3:36:56] <derap41> ok I'm done
[3:36:59] <%LiterallyTotori> It's a Kojima game.
[3:37:14] <Andrei11Droasca> Cant be brown and cant even be European LUL
[3:37:31] <derap41> 90 kg of anti matter can cause an exstinctionn level explosion
[3:37:38] <derap41> don't fuck with anti mater
[3:37:52] <chaos2frozen> Anti-matter does one thing- blow shit up
[3:38:03] <acedeone> Death Stranding is a Dark Matter
[3:38:20] <Pappajimbo> though if was real-antimatter gamma rays would have irradiated the surface
[3:38:22] <derap41> @chaos2frozen e=mc¨¨^2 is fucking scary
[3:38:24] <%LiterallyTotori> You can understand what he shows you. You have the option to dig deeper.
[3:38:33] <morcego_cinzento_arts> introducing Anti-matterman
[3:38:50] <Prevot> I don't think we need all this shit, Heartman
[3:38:50] <%Irridium> oh kojima
[3:38:57] <Andrei11Droasca> So much homo in this game KappaPride
[3:39:06] <+linSP> what kind of homo are YOU
[3:39:20] <%GeneralSCPatton> All this philosophical bullshit, and I'm just over here being a homo fappus
[3:39:21] <Tucker0603> ALPHA GAMER
[3:39:26] <derap41> Kohima literally calling story tellers the next step in human evolution

[3:39:30] <worldbrand> homo (ludens) rise up
[3:39:36] <+VidulaSaix> LUL
[3:39:47] <+linSP> big homo gamers wya
[3:39:48] <JDebss> I love it when Kojima drags real history/facts kicking and screaming into his narrative
[3:39:52] <Graxe_> No, it is your species
[3:39:55] <+VidulaSaix> Same debs
[3:40:05] <Graxe_> Homo ludens is your species classification

[3:40:17] <@Solidus_113> Homo Animus
[3:40:21] <%Black_Machete> Woolie the Homo scrublord
[3:40:29] <Andrei11Droasca> I don't think Kojima has the best grasp on English
[3:40:34] <derap41> sapience is not sentience
[3:40:44] <acedeone> it's suppose to bridge us to a common ancestor but I don't know how the homo stuff translates in different languages
[3:40:45] <derap41> thought you knew that Wolie
[3:41:20] <acedeone> Homo Superior
[3:41:28] <jase__x> Woolie please

[3:42:22] <worldbrand> the difference between any two given species in a genus can at times be kinda nebulous, but yeah this is absurd

[3:45:48] <@Solidus_113> Remember your Antimatter bombs
[3:46:17] <RC_S3kshun8> I've been gone a while so this could be the norm, but Reggi'es beard makes him look like Denzel. Bad ass.
[3:46:26] <+drfaustisdead> I believe it was in relation to the anti matter bomb you delivered to Mountain Knot.
[3:47:50] <derap41> This is not about death stranding but something else more real
[3:48:13] <alrobot2014> solve the death stranding and the declining birthrate

[4:03:15] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus ya gotta stick it in her exhaust pipe
[4:03:22] <alrobot2014> bipedal fleshlights are the first step towards bipedal nuclear platforms
[4:03:23] <+BionoidLCR> thats hot
[4:03:27] <AxelCezar> bipedal fleshlight is a very good description of new bots
[4:03:28] <@Solidus_113> There are people who have sex with their cars though
[4:03:37] <+BionoidLCR> a weapon to surpass auto blow

[4:04:10] <%LiterallyTotori> Some sex even car dragons

[4:04:24] <Andrei11Droasca> Men, space sex must suck
[4:04:28] <+VidulaSaix> Anyone that says they wouldn't exhaust 2B's pipes is a fucking liar LUL
[4:04:42] <+lethallunacyx> That exhaust pipe is so warm trust me, I mean i heard
[4:04:43] <derap41> But Woolie the theme wouldn
[4:04:50] <+VidulaSaix> Reggie thats old lore
[4:04:52] <+wmeldrum> CHEMICALS
[4:04:52] <derap41> 't work if they didn't think of it as a tool
[4:04:53] <%LiterallyTotori> I'd A2 before 2B
[4:04:55] <%The_Timo> if it was the only way to safely travel and survive, we would adapt and accept lol
[4:05:11] <grayjammer> WOOLIE HATES PETS?!?!? SwiftRage SwiftRage SwiftRage
[4:05:19] <+Caped_Eggy> Cats and dogs are way cuter than babies
[4:05:23] <%GeneralSCPatton> PROTECC PUPPERS AND CATTOS AND ERI
[4:05:31] <AxelCezar> newborn babies are ugly, as newborn kittens and puppies. Days old puppies are equivalent of a 1y old baby, and human baby 1y are cute as hell
[4:05:31] <clack14> and cost less Caped_Eggy
[4:05:34] <lotharrio> Cuteness has been a very long term successful strategy for mammals.
[4:05:36] <redrins> normal babies are different from BBs
[4:05:37] <+linSP> we live in an age where people think animals have more value than human life
[4:05:41] <Randomly_Werewolf> To consolidate Woolie’s statement: He hates dogs
[4:05:41] <Pappajimbo> it like people disassociate from the fact because the idea of disposable babies is horrific
[4:05:44] <+Caped_Eggy> @clack14 Now we're talking
[4:05:56] <%The_Timo> those who didnt accept are probably dead, thinking God would protect them lol
[4:05:58] <+drfaustisdead> TBF population control has to be something that's taken into account with the knot cities. Also people forget that there's basically no privacy in this world because people need to be monitored 24-7 because you're a nuke in waiting.
[4:06:03] <Andrei11Droasca> Woolie loves his big white legg more then the animal's Kappa
[4:06:07] <TheLaw3D4> @WoolieVersus Do you wanna make things less shitty? Then use the tool and fuck your robot.
[4:06:15] <@Solidus_113> It's a tool because it can't grow. They don't live outside the tube
[4:06:43] <AxelCezar> pat is great at that
[4:06:46] <+linSP> if a bb becomes a person it gets bricked tho
[4:06:46] <+drfaustisdead> put the baby in the tube or deal with invisible nuke ghosts, hate to say it but tube that baby.
[4:06:48] <MSN04_Sazabi> Deadman is not even a person, why would he give a fuck?
[4:06:50] <arkv01> it's still alive but yeah they were born to die
[4:07:07] <+Caped_Eggy> I guess it's like live stocks
[4:07:10] <redrins> they are barely alive as is
[4:07:12] <derap41> They're not real people because they're flawed
[4:07:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> @linsp To be fair, we've selectively bred dogs to be cuter to us than our own babies. It could actually be a real problem in the long run.
[4:07:33] <clack14> BORN TO DIE / WORLD IS A FUCK / Kill Em All 1989 / I am trash man
[4:07:41] <TheLaw3D4> @redrins They are totally alive, they just die easy
[4:07:47] <Tucker0603> all I'm saying is that Sahalanthropus has a nice booty on her
[4:07:54] <DatAsuna> That zimbardo study was debunked day one woolie
[4:08:02] <clack14> Tucker0603 kojimia knows what he is doing.
[4:08:02] <derap41> That experiment was doctored
[4:08:05] <DatAsuna> no serious psychologist cites the stanford experiemtn
[4:08:13] <JDebss> yeah it's really weird that everyone seems ok with it but there must be some context we're missing
[4:08:17] <Andrei11Droasca> If it don't work, then time for evil science shit !
[4:08:23] <arkv01> oh boy les not do that debate
[4:08:23] <+paladinstarbuster> Use it or nuke the surronding area
[4:08:28] <+VidulaSaix> It's not a baby
[4:08:30] <DatAsuna> Pat would warn you real quick not to refer to that zimbardo study as legit
[4:08:34] <+VidulaSaix> It's literally still a fetus
[4:08:47] <Tucker0603> @clack14 yep, got them cyborg birthing hips on her
[4:09:11] <redrins> @TheLaw3D4 they still have expiration tags, it's a limited existence with a connection to the dead
[4:09:20] <Picosunloaded> @WoolieVersus What about live stock woolie, same concept
[4:09:35] <@Solidus_113> blend those chickens for your nuggets
[4:09:41] <clack14> don't connect to cow, you will eat it soon.
[4:09:47] <TheLaw3D4> @redrins That doesn't make them any less alive or human
[4:09:52] <NotHereToStream> bruh, people discard their humanity to cope with shit
[4:10:23] <redrins> @TheLaw3D4 makes it easier to use them so casually because they are a necessary means for survival tho
[4:10:38] <Andrei11Droasca> Even tho you rise it as a tool.al the time
[4:10:55] <TheLaw3D4> Something, something pro life something.

[4:13:16] <Frostydough1> dude imagine it, how to get woolie to open his eyes "Hey look a short haired muscle girl who is a giantess!!!"
[4:13:23] <%bread_assassin> I thought it wasn’t bad.
[4:13:27] <lyriuswolf13> I thought he would play it since its made by Cyberconnect2 like the Naruto games
[4:13:29] <TheLaw3D4> Nah it's totally the same.
[4:13:41] <%GeneralSCPatton> @frostydough1 WHERE?! sweetc2Gasm
[4:13:42] <Frostydough1> i too partake in omnivorism
[4:13:43] <+zanzibar_junker> Noi is 1
[4:13:48] <JDebss> What if BBs were delicious?
[4:14:02] <sosuke5> Pesticides used on crops kill a way larger proportion of animals proportional to slaughtering one cow.
[4:14:21] <derap41> Woolie in nature you would eat meat less than once a week and you would scavage not eat mass prodiced farm meat
[4:14:26] <DatAsuna> Not the american meat industry
[4:14:29] <DatAsuna> That shit is FILTHY
[4:14:34] <+zanzibar_junker> doodHokey
[4:14:34] <DatAsuna> Not even just ethically
[4:14:39] <DatAsuna> on a basic hygene level
[4:14:43] <Frostydough1> RIP @GeneralSCPatton but seriously those things in bird box never even touched a person
[4:14:52] <%LiterallyTotori> It's basically 3D Legacy of Goku, which is something I've wanted for a long time.
[4:14:53] <@Solidus_113> I think you mean to say Omnivores. Humans can't survive as carnivores
[4:14:54] <+linSP> we JUST had a cannibalcast
[4:15:01] <MSN04_Sazabi> A friend of mine went to a slaughterhouse once, didn't eat meat for a couple of weeks. But of course the shock effect worn off eventually.
[4:15:19] <+linSP> human meat tastes like pork btw
[4:15:40] <Andrei11Droasca> @solidus_113 I think they can though
[4:15:48] <krabsan> Ok but lets be real, to me the reason for being vegetarian or vegan is the ecological impact of the meat and diary industries not feeling bad about animals
[4:15:57] <lyriuswolf13> @linSP thank you for the much needed information on my next victim. :)
[4:16:09] <krabsan> if we continue the way we consume food we will not survive as a species
[4:16:15] <derap41> So eat the bb but acknowledged that its a person got it
[4:16:27] <sosuke5> "it's a tool, but love it though"
[4:16:27] <TheLaw3D4> I think eating meat is totally ethically messed up. I just accept my morals are as fucked as everyone else.
[4:16:42] <clack14> is it fun to eat humans?
[4:16:43] <MSN04_Sazabi> Didn't know Greta was watching Woolie's streams
[4:16:44] <emeraldskrull> if we continue the way we consume internet we will not survive as a species
[4:16:49] <%barkon345> its the concept of the other
[4:16:52] <lyriuswolf13> Eat grASS
[4:17:01] <hardcore_violence> eating meat is super not for survival lol... remember the cognitive dissonance earlier...?
[4:17:05] <%LiterallyTotori> The ideal omnivore diet is having a diet of everything in balance and moderation
[4:17:08] <Andrei11Droasca> Its not as good as just being wat you're supposed to be witch is a omnivore, but there are people on a carnivore diet right now
[4:17:12] <NotHereToStream> coping mechanism yeaaaah
[4:17:16] <TheLaw3D4> @emeraldskrull Agreed, we need to integrate FAAR more with the internet, The sooner we get neurolink the better
[4:17:19] <AxelCezar> oh there is a lot of "pretending not real" nowadays
[4:17:22] <%barkon345> its how people are so easily able to kill other people during wars if they think of the enemies as monsters
[4:17:40] <@Solidus_113> don't hide from the anime tiddies
[4:17:46] <%GeneralSCPatton> But parry reality tho. And then counter it. Reality is not safe on parry.
[4:17:48] <@Solidus_113> they're just as real
[4:17:51] <MSN04_Sazabi> Nobody is on a carnivore diet, shut up. Obligate carnivores have 80% or more meat in their diet, how many humans eat that much meat?

[5:15:12] <duskrush> Was Rei a giant BT all along?
[5:15:18] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Woolie would not be saying that if it were Zone of the Enders robots
[5:15:59] <Prevot> what is this 999 shit
[5:16:13] <redrins> cant hate it if you're already one, o n e o f u s
[5:16:34] <arkv01> well I mean first of all, the tangification was not consensual
[5:16:38] <Andrei11Droasca> The EGO is there exclusively to stop that
[5:16:41] <duskrush> If giant Rei eats you, it'll trigger a voidout
[5:16:41] <+demonsamura> im straight so im not really interested in joining with my fellow man
[5:16:46] <+cvp5127> the morphogenetic field?

[5:19:31] <+demonsamura> i wonder how much cargo a neanderthal could carry
[5:19:40] <Prevot> I thought neanderthals were European?
[5:19:40] <derap41> Woolie might have killed someone
[5:19:47] <%GeneralSCPatton> @duskrush Mads: Act II
[5:20:00] <+VidulaSaix> Next stream will be a real good one
[5:20:07] <NotHereToStream> Actually you may want to 5 star her for the shotgun upgrade
[5:20:20] <duskrush> Neanderthal, we've added the wheel to your PCC

[5:20:41] <AxelCezar> story time with woolie and regie tomatoSN
[5:20:51] <@Solidus_113> Doctors kill so many people by fucking up surgery
[5:20:57] <+cvp5127> just fabricate an autoblow
[5:20:59] <alrobot2014> physical touch is still a desirable thing though?
[5:21:00] <derap41> The incentive is to socialize if you need a reason you're doing it wrong
[5:21:13] <arkv01> doc boomer
[5:21:26] <duskrush> Lag in a virtual surgery must suck
[5:21:30] <AMstone776> ai surgeon sounds legit.

[5:22:22] <AMstone776> AI doctors and surgeons would be super fucking cheaper.
[5:22:23] <derap41> Nothing says you can't spend time with other just because you don't need to visit a doctor
[5:22:26] <TheLaw3D4> "Could you imagine dying before you turn 10,000 like a fucking loser?"
[5:22:29] <Andrei11Droasca> But wat if the EI decides "Fuck them humans" and just stabs you ?
[5:22:33] <+Proxzo> If AI is good enough, it'll be a person anyways.
[5:22:34] <AMstone776> they don't need food or shit.
[5:22:44] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Reggie just spoke what we all wanted before we even gave it a thought

[5:23:33] <alexandrecau> all the best robots but now you have to stay in latveria
[5:23:34] <derap41> He just doesn't want to lose his job

[5:25:32] <+VidulaSaix> Watch out for the whites!
[5:25:43] <EndgameContent> Hey, you know that the guy who invented the Segway also invented a portable dialysis machine? But it got lobbyist-ed into illegality because it would've lost some companies money.
[5:26:00] <EndgameContent> We are constantly shooting ourselves in the foot because we don't want to be made obsolete.

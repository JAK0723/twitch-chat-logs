[0:17:03] <fist_wizard_jay> Ride with Norman Reedus and his funky feetus
[0:17:17] <+xpakeo> i wonder if pats actually gonna show up to the stream
[0:17:35] <Mothman742> playing this fighting makes me feel like im on getting into fighting games with wooile madden PogChamp
[0:17:45] <Laecerelius> Paint that shit gold!
[0:17:46] <+Weeewer> Pat really oversold how little plot there is. Now Chapter 3 is BIG TRUCKIN but its not as backloaded as he said
[0:17:53] <+Left_Justified> American Truck Simulator 2020 PogChamp
[0:17:55] <VidulaSaix> Yeah Pat HELLA undersold it
[0:17:55] <fist_wizard_jay> no, I wonder if Woolie will stumble on a part of Pat’s fucking infrstructure monopoly
[0:17:55] <arkv01> cybertruck DLC mb?
[0:18:05] <+Weeewer> Yeah sorry he undersold how much plot there is
[0:18:15] <redrins> so is woolie gonna be building roads and ziplines?
[0:18:22] <+drfaustisdead> Woolie's one of the only DS streamers that I can watch because I'm taking a lot of time in every area.
[0:18:31] <fist_wizard_jay> Will Pat become the construction mafia of Death Stranding’s roads?!
[0:18:32] <+xpakeo> not this stream @redrins
[0:18:40] <+xpakeo> he is VERY far away from that
[0:18:45] <arkv01> can we ruin pats roads
[0:18:52] <spirittiart> Do ziplines 4 hours and win
[0:18:53] <fist_wizard_jay> piss on them?
[0:18:57] <+Weeewer> hahahaha
[0:19:07] <fist_wizard_jay> piss and shit on Pat’s road Woolie
[0:19:09] <+Left_Justified> nice
[0:19:20] <Mothman742> minhversus littering
[0:19:22] <redrins> wait I missed a couple of episodes, where exactly in the story is he
[0:19:24] <arkv01> I think the like system in DS is supposed to be ironic, arousing ire and disgust from us was the intended effect
[0:19:29] <+Weeewer> Woolie has an item equipped and hes not reading chat oh no
[0:19:30] <+drfaustisdead> Nothing more American than leaving garbage everywhere.
[0:19:30] <%alrobot2014> people leaving their fucking trucks in front of distro centers
[0:19:33] <HolisticField> shit adn fart and cumn on pats roads
[0:19:34] <+Weeewer> He's gonna be running slow all stream
[0:19:44] <xdeathknightx> Yeah Pat thinks people will delete things. I see people with thousands of likes, they will never delete those things
[0:19:47] <mrfreezepunsbestpuns> DS is a confusing acronym, my mind went to Dark Souls and Dead Space first
[0:19:58] <fist_wizard_jay> lol
[0:20:00] <+drfaustisdead> I just remove them from my world.
[0:20:19] <+xpakeo> instead of DS for the acronym we can say.... A HIDEO KOJIMA GAME
[0:20:22] <+Left_Justified> I think you mean Demon's Souls
[0:20:28] <+karldeck> @mrfreezepunsbestpuns At least it isn't AC
[0:20:47] <+drfaustisdead> I mean we're in a Death Stranding stream chat, context and all.
[0:20:48] <+Weeewer> Youre good
[0:20:54] <%Lion_kun> Turn back
[0:21:15] <Mothman742> so is woolie not gonna read chat at all?
[0:21:17] <VidulaSaix> I dont think he picked up the actual order
[0:21:19] <+Left_Justified> relying on others DansGame
[0:21:23] <fist_wizard_jay> PFFT
[0:21:23] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:21:26] <SomersaultJustice> MARIO?
[0:21:26] <VidulaSaix> Reggie may read it but they wont address it during LP sections
[0:21:28] <spirittiart> moodbot agrees
[0:21:31] <+Left_Justified> Agro!
[0:21:32] <+Weeewer> @WoolieVersus you have an item equipped which reduces your speed
[0:21:33] <SomersaultJustice> MAARRRIIIIOOOO?
[0:21:36] <+Weeewer> He will never read this but
[0:21:40] <+Weeewer> maybe just maybe
[0:21:41] <+ConLin_Arts_> Weegie and Woogie
[0:21:45] <+drfaustisdead> Will we get strand parries this session?
[0:21:45] <fist_wizard_jay> YELL YOUR APPRECIATION WOOLIE
[0:21:55] <Mothman742> no reading chat? time to fuck shit up Kappa
[0:21:57] <+Left_Justified> where is his horse?
[0:22:11] <rubbersnake21> damn he's got a long way to go
[0:22:22] <+Left_Justified> Epona DLC when?
[0:22:29] <+xpakeo> i pray he reads chat, if not he might bumble fuck around and we wont be able to save him from it
[0:22:34] <Medo3G> is woolie gonna read his objective?
[0:22:37] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus please tell me you know you can parry in this game
[0:22:54] <spirittiart> Cryme Tyme
[0:22:57] <+Weeewer> Hes pulling out his god damn strand
[0:22:58] <+Left_Justified> When is woolie going to play the game and get past this tutorial? ResidentSleeper
[0:23:03] <fist_wizard_jay> I think the best example of petty revenge Ive heard of in this game
[0:23:22] <fist_wizard_jay> knocking out all the MULEs in a camp, and pissing on the floors of their tents
[0:23:29] <+MrMoonGoose> You can Parry in this game
[0:23:32] <+ConLin_Arts_> Bike-Mads when??
[0:23:32] <Laecerelius> Parry and choke 'em out!
[0:23:34] <+Weeewer> Parries are fun
[0:23:34] <VidulaSaix> Ideally the best outcome from todays session is Woolie gets to the next chapter so he'll have a LOT to do off stream
[0:23:43] <Mothman742> u can daigo parry MULES
[0:23:54] <+xpakeo> this game slowly evolves into Third Strike as time goes on
[0:23:54] <reiju_22> mules are so easy to fight LUL
[0:24:04] <+ConLin_Arts_> ye
[0:24:14] <+Weeewer> you had it equipped already
[0:24:14] <+drfaustisdead> @reiju_22 yeah I don't even stealth anymore.
[0:24:26] <%jinking79> it a tekken side step
[0:24:28] <+bread_assassin> Yeah, it's really not that hard to take out a whole MULE camp.
[0:24:30] <+Weeewer> yee
[0:24:31] <@Squdnate> sbfpYeyeye
[0:24:33] <+drfaustisdead> same with BT's
[0:24:33] <+ConLin_Arts_> But THOSE Mules, oooh boi
[0:24:33] <+Left_Justified> tanking death stranding evoMindBlown
[0:24:34] <Solidnick18> Bts are monkaS
[0:24:38] <+xpakeo> playing on hard mode and not carrying weapons make mules a nightmare
[0:24:53] <Mothman742> chat what chapter u think woolie will leave off this session?
[0:24:56] <vege514> unless youre on a bike..
[0:25:00] <+ConLin_Arts_> 2
[0:25:02] <fist_wizard_jay> choke em with rope after parries, steal their shit and piss on the floor on the way out
[0:25:03] <VidulaSaix> Hopefully he'll finish this chapter
[0:25:05] <+xpakeo> or that lol
[0:25:37] <+xpakeo> BTs are jokes after the first hour
[0:25:46] <+drfaustisdead> ^
[0:25:49] <+Weeewer> BTs are never a joke imo
[0:25:50] <%GeneralSCPatton> Cheer10000 I am Watchstream Bitsman. Let me give a 15 minute monologue about my name. You see, giving bits and having messages read produces oxytocin, and creates strands that connect a streamer to their audience, like a bridge or a road. You could say that your love for us is like a truck.
[0:25:59] <+Weeewer> Unless you got half of your cargo dedicated to killing them
[0:26:07] <+drfaustisdead> started farming them for crystals hard.
[0:26:08] <+Weeewer> Which I'd rather have my cargo dedicated for cargo lol
[0:26:09] <reiju_22> PogChamp
[0:26:22] <VidulaSaix> You're not supposed to be here. You never picked up the mission @WoolieVersus
[0:26:25] <gazdropish> @GeneralSCPatton BERSERKER
[0:26:28] <Solidnick18> @xpakeo pretty much and the mules are jobbers.
[0:26:35] <NotHereToStream> I don't think woolie took on the order for this
[0:26:39] <fist_wizard_jay> LOL
[0:26:42] <+Left_Justified> are you saying these jobs are too similar? atpCap
[0:26:43] <+Weeewer> jesus
[0:26:57] <+drfaustisdead> hey he's getting back in it's fine.
[0:27:11] <+xpakeo> @Solidnick18 mules do more than BTs but both are pretty much irrelevant
[0:27:23] <fist_wizard_jay> Woolie bless you
[0:27:54] <+Weeewer> You guys must walk around with a shit ton of grenades and guns or something. I usually sneak past enemies unless I'm going in specifically to take them out
[0:28:10] <+xpakeo> so, anyone think woolie will cause a voidout before he beats the game?
[0:28:10] <VidulaSaix> I feel like this will be the struggle every session is having to relearn controls
[0:28:46] <+drfaustisdead> @Weeewer If I'm going to recover something from a BT area I'll carry 4 cases of grenades.
[0:28:47] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games

[0:58:56] <jbrooksdev> its the boot. the temporary blue meter is stamina
[0:58:58] <Soulbishop> Woolie is a linear man. The straight line says go over the unclimbable mountain.
[0:59:00] <%generalve> WHY ARE MODERN GAMES HAVE SMALL TEXT/UI
[0:59:00] <itesket> It's not that big of a deal
[0:59:05] <Mothman742> @cymen90 just fight him already
[0:59:05] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> oh is he going to the wind farm?
[0:59:07] <Nested_Dreams> @swedish_expert The map style requires to tilt the map to see the elevation effectively, plus woolie is far from the screen
[0:59:08] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> this will be fun
[0:59:19] <+drfaustisdead> you can quick switch boots by pressing up on the D pad.

[1:16:20] <%mintyrobo> Chat taking ACTUAL stamina damage from watching this
[1:16:29] <haitakaa> auto arrange would have made that a bit easier
[1:16:32] <Solidnick18> i would get new boots
[1:16:35] <+sleepymastiff> spray time unh

[1:16:35] <VidulaSaix> LUL
[1:16:36] <+Weeewer> Yeah imma need to drink a monster at how painful that was
[1:16:37] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @WoolieVersus so that boots wear off, you can worry about your feet when the boots are absolutely gone from your feet
[1:16:45] <Solidus0101> No spray?
[1:16:53] <Soulbishop> Oh he made it?
[1:16:56] <wighttrash> woolie playing with fire constsntly
[1:16:57] <+drfaustisdead> Auto arrange is really really useful.
[1:16:57] <Graxe_> It's really nice how chat is ignored for LP streams because we know we're shouting into the void.
[1:17:06] <Soulbishop> Look you a real porter bridges sam
[1:17:06] <xdeathknightx> when you are in your cargo menu use triangle please
[1:17:08] <haitakaa> spray only heals the container not the actual cargo
[1:17:08] <wighttrash> never not playing with fire
[1:17:14] <Graxe_> Which raises the tension
[1:17:18] <AngriestPatFanboy> Container spray!
[1:17:26] <+Weeewer> @Graxe_ hopefully they read during breaks at least
[1:17:27] <Soulbishop> BIG Risk Big DELIVERY

[1:18:48] <wighttrash> Woolie doesnt change his oil until the VERY LAST MILE
[1:18:49] <itesket> Inputting the wifi code
[1:18:55] <drefizz> might wanna see a doctor
[1:18:58] <Lelfro> the rust helps against the BTs
[1:19:00] <+Weeewer> Time bending internet is no joke
[1:19:02] <+Proxzo> Use your spray right before deilvery to refresh your packages for higher score
[1:19:04] <haitakaa> connect this man to the crazy crazy BT porn sites
[1:19:12] <NotHereToStream> the chiral network is necessary for the stadia to suceed
[1:19:21] <+Weeewer> @NotHereToStream not even a joke
[1:19:27] <wighttrash> not even the chiral network can make stadia good
[1:19:33] <+theAncopro> get that 5 star rating
[1:19:33] <GoldeNOVA> Fuck even post apocalyptic America has data caps
[1:19:43] <fist_wizard_jay> oh well fuck me

[1:20:34] <+paladinstarbuster> HOT MILFS ARE GETTING CLOSER
[1:20:35] <Graxe_> You'd think a chiral network would help Stadia's latency because of time stuff, but no

[1:23:44] <SunPraiser> reconect america by making a trail of piss from one city to the next
[1:23:50] <%chronoxgp> Standard orders are jus a bonus, not really important to the gameplay
[1:23:59] <haitakaa> the guns of the repatriates are filled with shit and piss and bloody jizz
[1:24:00] <scoopyoopydoo> piss strands across the globe

[1:24:33] <lotharrio> Change your shoes and drop your shield.
[1:24:44] <VidulaSaix> Yeah you almost have the bike. Once you get it, stuff goes MUCH faster
[1:24:50] <scoopyoopydoo> ew can sam get nasty feet?
[1:25:04] <+Weeewer> @scoopyoopydoo oh yes
[1:25:04] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:25:13] <scoopyoopydoo> gross
[1:25:14] <KiraKamixephos> It can get so bad that you gotta rip off a toe nail :)
[1:25:14] <xdeathknightx> Silly people telling Woolie about new things when he doesn't know how to use PCC's LUL
[1:25:14] <haitakaa> careful with that bike though, if you lose it you don't get another for a while
[1:25:17] <%GeneralSCPatton> You passed a bike at the Distro Center
[1:25:32] <Solidnick18> you only get one bike
[1:25:44] <haitakaa> also repair that shit
[1:25:47] <Tucker0603> there was a bike at one of the bases @woolieversus
[1:25:52] <Graxe_> There's gotta be a sub-category of feet people who love bloody feet
[1:26:00] <+theAncopro> you could recycle those resins
[1:26:19] <%chronoxgp> standard orders are just a bonus, once you do one they repeat themselves
[1:26:49] <scoopyoopydoo> is there a 3d scanned norman redus cock somewhere in this game?
[1:27:03] <SunPraiser> you wish
[1:27:04] <Mothman742> no LUL
[1:27:10] <%chronoxgp> the materials

[1:27:30] <scoopyoopydoo> so many plotholes
[1:27:33] <Mothman742> with his mind
[1:27:35] <scoopyoopydoo> not copping this one
[1:27:40] <%chronoxgp> you can dump materials in there like metal
[1:27:47] <%GeneralSCPatton> Materials
[1:27:51] <Puhff> It's not a David Cage game, so prolly no Reedus weiner
[1:27:51] <Graxe_> Same way Sims piss
[1:28:23] <+Weeewer> God, Reggie is so needed for these
[1:28:24] <+Weeewer> god bless him
[1:28:33] <+Left_Justified> david cage game has weiners? atpDog atpGasm
[1:28:34] <%GeneralSCPatton> Recycle materials
[1:28:44] <VidulaSaix> Some advice I'd recommend is not to worry too much about your equipment. Anything that's not a delivery can usually be crafted so you can just toss stuff once you've used it
[1:28:49] <+Weeewer> he can recycle them back in the distro center no biggie
[1:29:01] <+theAncopro> nuh uh
[1:29:13] <+Weeewer> Put your shoes on sweetie
[1:29:17] <%chronoxgp> deliver lost cargo
[1:29:17] <+Left_Justified> what about her emails
[1:29:18] <+Weeewer> tie those laces
[1:29:35] <+Left_Justified> painful feet
[1:29:42] <SunPraiser> my feet hurt, this distribution center is too loud, I wish I was home drinking monster
[1:29:46] <Graxe_> How moddable are games on the Decima engine? Are there games using the engine on PC even?
[1:29:51] <%GeneralSCPatton> Recycling is literally where the materials live until they are needed.
[1:30:02] <VidulaSaix> FEWTS
[1:30:03] <+Left_Justified> @sunpraiser atpRtsd1 atpRtsd2
[1:30:06] <haitakaa> it's a Sony engine
[1:30:06] <+Weeewer> you can also donate materials
[1:30:10] <+Weeewer> to help others <3
[1:30:15] <Graxe_> Considering it's Guerrila Games' engine.
[1:30:22] <Mothman742> reggie be like "FEET" Kreygasm
[1:30:33] <%chronoxgp> woolie deliver the lost cargo
[1:30:34] <+Weeewer> Use the container spray just so you know how it works
[1:30:39] <+theAncopro> many mechanics
[1:30:42] <Graxe_> So Death Stranding is gonna be the first
[1:30:43] <%mintyrobo> Who says this game has little to no combat, look at how much woolie fights with the menus Kappa
[1:30:45] <Ecchigun> just saying hi to reggie and woolie, i cant stay since i am still playing the game- have fun guys

[1:34:54] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @Graxe_ considering Reggie is acknowledging chat (without being obvious) id say they have chat open
[1:34:55] <+ConLin_Arts_> Through Spoopy forest
[1:35:00] <Graxe_> Shoot the BTs with your fists
[1:35:02] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> I remember going around the whole forest my first time through

[1:35:14] <Cymen90> @GeneralSCPatton Do not get me started on that. I love how Teppen is teaching him how much fighting games suck at teaching mechanics and how you are expected to know stuff just because they were introduced 20 years ago

[1:36:34] <Cymen90> @scoopyoopydoo No. And do not say GG and Skull Girls. Even those are still bad at teaching anything beyond mechanics. Because the problem with fighting games is the fun lies BEYOND the mechanics.

[2:39:37] <%GeneralSCPatton> Reggie is the info trucker
[2:39:39] <Nested_Dreams> The things you can't read reliably is things that have to be internalized though :/
[2:39:47] <VidulaSaix> Best outcome today is to finish this chapter. That'll put you in a good spot to do a lot off stream before next session
[2:39:48] <MojoKingIzakku> yeah i couldn't hear any characters talking earlier
[2:39:51] <VidulaSaix> And yeah game audio is a little low

[2:55:34] <Djinnazz> Matter/Antimatter
[2:55:44] <+paladinstarbuster> read that again
[2:55:49] <ChrisM341> BTs are US?
[2:57:11] <mrfreezepunsbestpuns> lazy eye renamed to chiral eye
[2:57:22] <Graxe_> Chiralium literally moves in the frozen time
[2:57:34] <turqrazor> is it true that in this game there is a meter telling you when you have to piss and shit?
[2:57:39] <SparkAfterDark> No, Chiralium literally is frozen in the regular time
[2:58:01] <Djinnazz> Like photons
[2:58:02] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[2:58:08] <VidulaSaix> tl;dr the Death Stranding made us aware of it
[2:58:10] <cochramd1992> LUL
[2:58:13] <+paladinstarbuster> LUL
[2:58:15] <KamiiFlow> stadia is too powerful
[2:58:15] <%GeneralSCPatton> First voidout made crystals appear
[2:58:23] <+theAncopro> Chirilium blames developers
[2:58:41] <R3c0n31> Chiral energy is too slow for us.
[2:58:42] <Vlesh> Second Void Out will allow the Stadia to work correctly
[2:58:47] <Graxe_> We still don't know what caused the Death Stranding to occur
[2:58:48] <+drfaustisdead> since it's never ages doesn't that mean it's basically pure potential?
[2:59:15] <KamiiFlow> atpCap
[2:59:17] <SparkAfterDark> These are all symptoms of loneliness and despair
[2:59:33] <%Irridium> the homo demons hu
[2:59:36] <pedroka_29> @graxe_ what is the death stranding?
[2:59:37] <%GeneralSCPatton> Homo Demens AKA MADLADS
[2:59:39] <arkv01> mads
[2:59:45] <arkv01> MADS MEN
[2:59:48] <SparkAfterDark> Literally it mimics symptoms of being isolated
[2:59:50] <+linSP> no homo
[3:00:05] <gvlt> reading class
[3:00:20] <Nested_Dreams> inb4 homo demens is porters worker union
[3:00:30] <ChrisM341> Sam is Doomguy
[3:01:00] <SparkAfterDark> chiral contamination is a physical representation of being lonely and isolated from society.
[3:01:10] <VidulaSaix> LIKECIN
[3:01:11] <R3c0n31> So regular people are literally walking Craters unless they have DOOMS
[3:01:16] <SparkAfterDark> Even when he's being subtle it's obvious
[3:01:17] <KamiiFlow> <3 >)

[3:01:30] <VidulaSaix> YEYEYE

[3:02:56] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> I will donate to you Woolie, if you acknowledge me
[3:02:56] <Camail> fuck teenage social media
[3:02:58] <Graxe_> Chapter 2, I think?
[3:02:58] <ScreamLord> High Schoolers, girls especially. Are terrible
[3:02:59] <KamiiFlow> oh man
[3:03:00] <dukenux> "number go up" spreads like wildfire
[3:03:03] <Vlesh> Wasn't that a black mirror episode?
[3:03:08] <Camail> that sounds like a nightmare
[3:03:19] <Djinnazz> yup
[3:03:22] <Vallhaine> Ultra rich people do the same thing. More money is just a scoreboard.
[3:03:23] <+drfaustisdead> I'll take the hellscape ghost apocalypse over this high school bullshit.
[3:03:25] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> THIS IS THE FUTURE
[3:03:28] <Graxe_> Get a withdrawl from no likes
[3:03:28] <dukenux> Validation is helluva drug
[3:03:28] <SparkAfterDark> Woolie watched a "documentary" on highschool girls that he made by himself in a van with a camera
[3:03:28] <+linSP> likecin addiction
[3:03:32] <Nested_Dreams> That sounds like standard facebook to me
[3:03:37] <Graxe_> Or not enough likes
[3:03:38] <%allups> thtll make me wanna fuck off
[3:03:39] <%Irridium> I was watching porn
[3:03:51] <masterfire23> ZOOMERS
[3:04:01] <KamiiFlow> fuckin zoomers atpRtsd
[3:04:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> Busy jacking it 12 times hellow2Manface
[3:04:12] <VidulaSaix> But thats ezactly what the game has LUL
[3:04:13] <arkv01> on your phone, pornhub premium app
[3:04:14] <+paladinstarbuster> ITS RIGHT THERE AT THE BOTTOM
[3:04:17] <+Matto424> You know it isn't real and that'll make it worse
[3:04:25] <VidulaSaix> Its literally on the screen RIGHT NOW
[3:04:30] <+drfaustisdead> Woolie why does money have value. It is an artificial concept after all.
[3:04:36] <SparkAfterDark> Woolie. Do you think all these likes you're getting are REAL?
[3:04:41] <VidulaSaix> Its next to the 66.4 kg LUL
[3:04:46] <%allups> it's a like if I actually like something id like it thts all it matters
[3:04:58] <Camail> LUL
[3:04:59] <americanchuck> deep
[3:05:01] <+theAncopro> when you like in this game its starts going up by dozens the more you mash, so big numbers are big lies
[3:05:01] <KamiiFlow> woolie will figure it out episode
[3:05:02] <ashuckel> the smirk
[3:05:02] <%DashXero> "shut the fuck up about it."
[3:05:02] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:05:09] <VidulaSaix> That video you got so muich shit for LUL
[3:05:12] <Camail> you're saying it for 2 different reasons
[3:05:14] <Solidnick18> damn
[3:05:19] <+drfaustisdead> The answer as always is chemicals.
[3:05:19] <R3c0n31> What kojima does is both super obvious but so deep
[3:05:21] <Camail> one to avoid instant gratifcation, one to avoid alwsuits
[3:05:22] <KamiiFlow> DO IT
[3:05:23] <VidulaSaix> Damn right Reggie
[3:05:23] <+DeRedBaron> I"ve heard about this for multiple sources
[3:06:02] <+linSP> yesterday you said tomorrow
[3:06:24] <ChrisM341> Or they steal the idea
[3:06:31] <VidulaSaix> Nope causde it needs to be said
[3:06:35] <VidulaSaix> And repeated for new ears
[3:07:11] <KamiiFlow> they can also jack your idea
[3:07:37] <VidulaSaix> Like NUNS3 LUL
[3:07:58] <+drfaustisdead> I's this the part where Woolie tells us that he's finally going to do A 1000 Years of Memories audio book?
[3:08:05] <Ether101_Prime> Remember that time Gorge Lucas had his son get shot on screen?
[3:08:10] <Solidnick18> i feel that
[3:08:21] <+MechaBaphomet> confirmed
[3:08:25] <VidulaSaix> The pop on seeing that episode was damn hype
[3:08:27] <VidulaSaix> Can confirm
[3:08:32] <zenith0111> THE BUILD UP
[3:08:37] <zenith0111> THE ANTICIPATION
[3:08:51] <SparkAfterDark> the antici
[3:08:55] <VidulaSaix> Oh right, this was an LP LUL
[3:08:58] <VidulaSaix> Felt like a podcast for a second
[3:09:28] <KamiiFlow> we comic books?
[3:09:55] <Solidnick18> lol
[3:10:13] <Vlesh> Yo my beach is sick, can't say the same for yours tho
[3:10:40] <%GeneralSCPatton> BEACH EPISODE
[3:10:49] <Solidnick18> son of a beach
[3:10:54] <KamiiFlow> beach plz
[3:11:06] <R3c0n31> oh wow this s important for later
[3:11:14] <Camail> AI don't have belly buttons
[3:11:20] <KamiiFlow> chiral beaches
[3:11:23] <Camail> cant have a strand if you dont got a belly button
[3:11:24] <Ultimatefool> THEME EXPLAINMAN
[3:11:35] <+linSP> but david said robots can love
[3:11:36] <KamiiFlow> atpRtsd
[3:11:41] <Rixstarian> Hey guys, how's it going? cohh7
[3:11:42] <Vlesh> Heartman is literally Kojima going "Ok yo, so this is what all this means"
[3:11:48] <NotHereToStream> exposition dumpman
[3:12:07] <GoldeNOVA> I sure wish this stuff was explained IN A SCENE
[3:12:08] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:12:12] <KamiiFlow> atpMunchies yo @Rixstarian
[3:12:15] <R3c0n31> optional exposition, you dont need to read any of this
[3:12:17] <meermadon> no pvp zones in the afterlife
[3:12:19] <Nested_Dreams> Tapping out, see ya chat
[3:12:27] <Rixstarian> @kamiiflow cohhHi
[3:12:40] <+theAncopro> which is good cause there's already enough hours of cutscenes
[3:12:42] <zenith0111> That's not exactly exposition but sure that works LUL
[3:13:01] <cochramd1992> nah, I'm pretty sure there's too much to enjoy in life for all power to be about leaving behind a big tomb
[3:13:23] <brunoberserk> mummies alive !
[3:13:23] <cochramd1992> really, power all comes down to the primal desires of feeding and getting laid
[3:13:42] <cochramd1992> and maybe some other creature comforts
[3:13:50] <+drfaustisdead> Those monks were full of centipedes anyway.
[3:14:13] <cochramd1992> don't remind me Woolie
[3:14:17] <+theAncopro> unless I VOID OUT
[3:14:22] <Vlesh> Create a crater
[3:14:23] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> nihilist
[3:14:23] <Solidnick18> i feel that
[3:14:25] <NotHereToStream> existential dread FeelsBadMan
[3:14:26] <+drfaustisdead> Then your ghost is going to turn your funeral into a nuke.
[3:14:26] <mrfreezepunsbestpuns> fight entropy!
[3:14:29] <%GeneralSCPatton> THIS CANNOT CONTINUE! BECOME AS GODS!
[3:14:37] <GoldeNOVA> "Take me now" says Reggie Kappa
[3:14:48] <ScreamLord> Not in Death Stranding! Corpses explode like nuclear bombs remember?
[3:14:50] <+Trimoon333> no
[3:14:56] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> NotLikeThis
[3:14:57] <+theAncopro> ueeGH literally soma
[3:14:59] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> not this again
[3:15:03] <Djinnazz> Soma?
[3:15:04] <Camail> nope teleporters suck
[3:15:05] <Vlesh> So he's just talking about The Thing isn't he?
[3:15:12] <+theAncopro> nOPe
[3:15:19] <+paladinstarbuster> woolie should play Soma
[3:15:29] <%GeneralSCPatton> The difference between you and a copy is purely academic and philosophical bullshit
[3:15:29] <NotHereToStream> Reggie v.1 dies and v.2 comes
[3:15:34] <+Trimoon333> you fuckin die Reggie
[3:15:35] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> WUT IF UR MUM RAN ON BATTRIES
[3:15:39] <+linSP> get this, sleeping is the same as teleporting
[3:15:39] <+theAncopro> what's scary is how would you know you died cause teleporter you just rmembers going in and out
[3:15:42] <zenith0111> So if I'm understanding this then it's not a teleporter.
[3:15:48] <zenith0111> It's a clone machine that kills.
[3:15:56] <KamiiFlow> ^
[3:15:57] <zenith0111> STUPID TECHNOLOGY
[3:16:03] <+primax104> Continuity of consciousness maaaaaaan
[3:16:11] <ChrisM341> Would you sacrifice yourself for yourself
[3:16:19] <Rixstarian> It's very Prestige
[3:16:24] <R3c0n31> Scary explanation of anything really
[3:16:25] <pshuuu> arent babies just copies of yourself
[3:16:27] <%GeneralSCPatton> You don't get to assert that it's not you. YOU DON'T FUCKING KNOWN
[3:16:28] <cochramd1992> oh no here we go again
[3:16:33] <eldrich_horror> nah fuck that other me
[3:16:33] <+primax104> But the same goes for sleeping
[3:16:34] <Solidnick18> that's nuts
[3:16:36] <Kongro_> The only logical solution to teleportation is killing you and then making a copy of you somewhere else.
[3:16:37] <+drfaustisdead> I feel like this only becomes an issue if there's a break in continuity of your experience. If you lose time fuck that.
[3:16:42] <notebooked> Nah babies are just 50% you
[3:16:43] <R3c0n31> @pshuuu Merged copies of both parents
[3:16:45] <cochramd1992> star trek teleporting is dumb
[3:16:46] <Camail> the worst part is, continuity of consciousness isn't even sufficient for a full theory of self
[3:16:54] <KamiiFlow> man fuck that clone
[3:16:56] <+linSP> are you okay with being me, or REALLY me-me
[3:17:02] <%GeneralSCPatton> BY THIS LOGIC, SLEEP IS DEATH
[3:17:07] <R3c0n31> THE MEMES
[3:17:17] <NotHereToStream> sleep is the beta for death Kappa
[3:17:20] <Blackjackal95> it depends on if you're a person who believes there's more to consciousness than biology or not
[3:17:23] <Vlesh> "The only me is me. Are you sure the only you is you?"
[3:17:24] <zenith0111> This is hardly a question about teleporters anymore LUL
[3:17:24] <+theCatastrophy> The Culture series has it to where if a clone is accidentally made, they are given full rights and treated as their own person
[3:17:25] <+theAncopro> why can't we just naruto it and all exist at the same time
[3:17:29] <Camail> sleep isn't death by this standard
[3:17:31] <@Solidus_113> I'd do it
[3:17:35] <VidulaSaix> Aww Reggie
[3:17:36] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Aww
[3:17:39] <mrfreezepunsbestpuns> I'd do it all the time every day no problem
[3:17:41] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> RANK UP!
[3:17:45] <SparkAfterDark> Woolie isn't saying he would do it back.
[3:17:59] <GoldeNOVA> Reggie will now take a lethal blow for you" PogChamp
[3:17:59] <+drfaustisdead> Use those clones to block the gunfire.
[3:18:00] <ChrisM341> Woolie just pulls out a gun to test that theory
[3:18:01] <zenith0111> WOOLIE WE ALL DIE ONE DAY
[3:18:02] <R3c0n31> @SparkAfterDark You right
[3:18:05] <Vlesh> Woolie still got Daigo to beat at Street Fighter to die this early
[3:18:06] <brunoberserk> woolie vs teleporter
[3:18:07] <NotHereToStream> if i have nothing to lose, sure, jump the fuck in
[3:18:08] <Solidnick18> lol
[3:18:10] <VidulaSaix> LMAO
[3:18:10] <Camail> LUL
[3:18:12] <Djinnazz> lol
[3:18:12] <zenith0111> LUL
[3:18:13] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> "and Woolie lied"

[3:18:14] <reiju_22> LUL
[3:18:14] <KamiiFlow> Jebaited sure
[3:18:16] <+TruSpindash> LUL
[3:18:17] <DracaenaLeaf> "yeah sure"
[3:18:21] <notebooked> The absolute liar
[3:18:22] <R3c0n31> Yeah Sure
[3:18:23] <VidulaSaix> REGGIE WAS WAITING FOR IT LUL
[3:18:26] <SparkAfterDark> -He said, you know, like a liar
[3:18:27] <jimmytwofeet> yeah sure
[3:18:28] <notebooked> if it's uncomplicated death then great
[3:18:35] <VidulaSaix> I'd never do the teleporter but I would do a brain transfer in a second
[3:18:44] <Solidnick18> getting shot monkaS
[3:18:45] <mrfreezepunsbestpuns> would tkae a bullet for you, but would not teleport for you
[3:19:04] <ChrisM341> What if you die and your clone wakes up in a David Cage game
[3:19:05] <zenith0111> DEATH BEGETS LIFE
[3:19:17] <pi_in_the_sci> Old men plant trees they'll never feel the shade of. Reggie is enlightened
[3:19:17] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[3:19:42] <jimmytwofeet> WHAT IF YOU ARE DAVID CAGE
[3:19:42] <+drfaustisdead> don't try to make this classy
[3:19:48] <SparkAfterDark> Life is only the belief that this moment will be followed by the next.
[3:20:13] <cochramd1992> booooo
[3:20:16] <ChrisM341> What 8f David Cage kills you and steals your life??
[3:20:23] <ChrisM341> *if
[3:20:24] <VidulaSaix> STRAAAAAAAAAAAAND
[3:20:30] <Solidnick18> Oh shit
[3:20:31] <GoldeNOVA> This is a stealth Woolie Will Figure It Out!
[3:20:35] <KamiiFlow> i like it atpSuspect
[3:20:40] <VidulaSaix> Now you get it LUL
[3:21:03] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> BIG BRAIN
[3:21:18] <VidulaSaix> Im reminded of that meme with Kojima and the bong at the Konami offices LUL
[3:21:24] <Grahfvitnir> Kojima would be the king of r/showerthoughts
[3:21:28] <Rixstarian> It's what he thinks after an episode of Twin Peaks
[3:21:38] <jimmytwofeet> I JUST WANNA GO SEA
[3:21:42] <zenith0111> We call those 6th dimensional beings
[3:21:45] <mrfreezepunsbestpuns> could humans have invented space travel to return to the center of the universe where they belong?
[3:21:50] <GoldeNOVA> "Bruh when you close your eyes, do you even exist?"" Kojima, baked out of his mind.
[3:21:56] <zenith0111> We exist in the 5th dimension
[3:22:04] <meermadon> legs were evolved because legs are sic
[3:22:06] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> hey guys, what's going o-never mind
[3:22:14] <Solidnick18> connections PogChamp
[3:22:31] <zenith0111> LUL
[3:22:38] <R3c0n31> i mean, isnt that actually correct?
[3:22:41] <KamiiFlow> that sounds more like us LUL
[3:22:44] <SparkAfterDark> Is the afterlife a beach because it was created by the thoughts of the first things that could conceive that death is something different from life, and the fish thought that land is the afterlife?
[3:22:47] <@Solidus_113> Lizard brain is cowardice
[3:22:53] <invisi_bliss> the death BACKDOWN
[3:22:59] <NotHereToStream> but we atleast live
[3:23:02] <Djinnazz> Bipedal BITCH
[3:23:14] <jimmytwofeet> NEVER BACK DOWN 2
[3:23:14] <VidulaSaix> HAAANDS
[3:23:17] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> STRANDS
[3:23:20] <R3c0n31> those who survive can live and mate, the stupid die first
[3:23:20] <GoldeNOVA> Bravery means death, cowardice means life.
[3:23:26] <Solidnick18> use em alot
[3:23:33] <@Solidus_113> Need hands to clap these alien cheeks
[3:23:38] <R3c0n31> @GoldeNOVA This is the way
[3:23:41] <VidulaSaix> Solidus artharsGet artharsOut
[3:23:44] <+drfaustisdead> Legs are just the result of Negative Penalty.
[3:23:51] <SparkAfterDark> You don't clap cheeks with hands you fool
[3:23:53] <Camail> ok but like, but if someone touched your hand you don't choose to feel that
[3:23:54] <@Solidus_113> apatSmug
[3:23:58] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @VidulaSaix
[3:24:02] <+theAncopro> see they just wanna shake hands
[3:24:09] <VidulaSaix> Moobot doesnt want friends FeelsBadMan
[3:24:13] <+paladinstarbuster> THERE GLOMPING YOU
[3:24:17] <Solidnick18> lol
[3:24:18] <Graxe_> BTs just want friends
[3:24:19] <+linSP> they want a ghost hug
[3:24:20] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Hannibals Hands
[3:24:21] <Grahfvitnir> Or they're just trying to grab a snack
[3:24:32] <GoldeNOVA> Maybe humans evolved hands to jack off
[3:24:40] <R3c0n31> I mean sure they want hugs, but those cause craters
[3:24:41] <+linSP> they vibe checkin
[3:24:45] <zenith0111> Are hands funny? I lost the thread
[3:24:52] <cochramd1992> >3 years ago
[3:25:05] <Blackjackal95> so does everyone become an interdimensional semi-eldritch being when they die??
[3:25:22] <SparkAfterDark> @GoldeNOVA Seems a waste of evolution once you see a dog lick it's own balls tbh
[3:25:25] <LtBoink> they get a lil beachy

[3:25:40] <R3c0n31> @Blackjackal95 Nah you just die. Then a co[y of your soul turns into a BT
[3:25:57] <+drfaustisdead> Okay can we just take a moment to talk about the fact that they opened a portal to the nuke ghost dimension for faster internet and have no idea how the infrastructure works. So all their science is just magic disguised as science.
[3:25:57] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Its so weird to me that Mama is literally Misa in that Netflix Death Note movie
[3:26:06] <zenith0111> No guys Kojima is in this game LUL he's a hidden cameo in the private room

[3:31:04] <GKannel> Woolie, you can enable zoom on the Acessibility settings!!!
[3:31:04] <R3c0n31> @SparkAfterDark That would be good sequel content if kojima wanted
[3:31:08] <zenith0111> Porting is not the loneliest thing. It's the job that has you interact with the most people.
[3:31:12] <zenith0111> Just wow.
[3:31:15] <GKannel> It helped me a great bunch.

[3:35:33] <GKannel> ACESSIBILITY SETTINGS PLS! D:
[3:35:34] <+theAncopro> the story cutscenes are mostly about Sam's relevance

[3:35:42] <+primax104> apatBig enjoyed
[3:35:48] <zenith0111> LONGER THAN MGS4
[3:35:56] <VidulaSaix> Cause a lot of people dont read Reggie
[3:36:04] <VidulaSaix> So they pretend it doesnt exist
[3:36:07] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> because the people talking about it only cared about calling it a walking sim
[3:36:11] <VidulaSaix> Yep
[3:36:33] <NotHereToStream> next game is a horror game so its gonna be interesting
[3:36:38] <+drfaustisdead> Plug your Ethernet cable into that ghost for permanent 5 bars.
[3:36:41] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> wah wah why is it walking sim wah why am i deliver man, VINNY WHY DO U NOT SHOT?!
[3:36:50] <ScreamLord> Kojima the Game
[3:36:51] <+linSP> reading? whats that? anyways walking sim boring
[3:37:07] <ChrisM341> I still want Kojima's first movie to be a horror based cgi short based on one of Sam's nightmares
[3:37:12] <VidulaSaix> I honestly underestimated it but Kojima won me back by the end of the game. Easily my favorite game of his after MGS3
[3:37:13] <+drfaustisdead> Clip that Reggie line!
[3:37:13] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Reggie: You will deliver my cum

[3:38:50] <zenith0111> STAR WARS WAS MADE FOR KIDS
[3:39:00] <+Allyofwar> Hey, lets not lump Clone Wars and Rebals together.
[3:39:12] <VidulaSaix> Clone Wars is good though
[3:39:14] <VidulaSaix> But Rebels
[3:39:18] <zenith0111> @allyofwar Which Clone Wars??? LUL
[3:39:22] <spirittiart> This is the way
[3:39:22] <VidulaSaix> The original
[3:39:23] <zenith0111> There's 3
[3:39:24] <VidulaSaix> Animated
[3:39:33] <gunsrlove> Vinland Saga has viking pacifism, so i wouldnt put it on there as the smartest thing ever
[3:39:54] <VidulaSaix> Speaking of kotor what was that kotor 2 teaser about I wonder 🤔
[3:39:57] <DracaenaLeaf> I wasn't a fan of how silent the original clone wars cartoon was
[3:40:03] <+linSP> i loved clone wars animated by the samurai jack guy
[3:40:14] <+theAncopro> fake fan only watched all the movies
[3:40:25] <zenith0111> The cartoon was made for kids and the best episodes are those without dialogue
[3:40:25] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[3:40:33] <GoldeNOVA> Clone Wars is fun, Rebels is... ehhh
[3:40:44] <gunsrlove> Clone Wars is dumb fun mostly
[3:40:45] <based_versauen> The Republic Commando books are great
[3:40:48] <redrins> once again, there is no reason to watch every kamen rider
[3:40:49] <gunsrlove> but it does try to fix the prequels
[3:40:52] <gunsrlove> a little bot
[3:40:55] <gunsrlove> bit*
[3:41:11] <VidulaSaix> Woolie you should know to not listen to Pat about opinions. It's Pat LUL
[3:41:17] <VidulaSaix> One Piece is good, but again, it's Pat LUL
[3:41:29] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @zenith0111
[3:41:31] <Pequod1> @WoolieVersus what about Game of Thrones in this analogy???
[3:41:36] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> "You only need to watch 70 episodes until Gintama becomes good, I promise!!!"
[3:41:56] <VidulaSaix> Gon in 60 Seconds FeelsBadMan
[3:41:57] <Pequod1> I woulda said Game of Thrones was good up until those last few episodes
[3:42:04] <GoldeNOVA> One Piece is good, I haven't watched it all though, since I'll never end
[3:42:28] <+theAncopro> I watched 100 episode and it it was great but then i needed to continue with life
[3:42:30] <VidulaSaix> What the hook is yeah
[3:42:35] <Blackjackal95> Game of Thrones was consistently raising the bar for quality and pacing until it hit around S5
[3:42:37] <DracaenaLeaf> One piece should only be watched as One Pace lately, or read the manga. the anime is mostly just standing still
[3:42:46] <SilentStarPlatinum> there are currently 911 episodes of one piece
[3:42:54] <+primax104> There is atime and a place to get into huge timesinks

[3:45:20] <GoldeNOVA> Jojo is a fun manga, but it's not up to the greats
[3:45:25] <VidulaSaix> Just surprising since we've heard you talk abotu SBR a lot and not too much about Vagabond

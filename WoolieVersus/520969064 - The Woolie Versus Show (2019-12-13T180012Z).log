[0:45:35] <LoveYouDead> We need to upgrade that purse with an emergency barf bag
[0:45:39] <%QaizerArt> @QuestionableRadioactivity It's just Moobot man, don't worry, just don't yell.

[0:45:51] <Make_me_mad> Do you think the wedding will go off like normal when a dude vomits into a purse and flees the room?
[0:46:01] <+QuestionableRadioactivity> How is this still a thing
[0:46:02] <Picia000123> Jesus, how it would be that bad
[0:46:06] <+zombiedinosour> how much u care about the bride and groom is how to decide
[0:46:16] <+KingOfTheGeats> I feel like you could bring a plastic bag if you're worried about vomiting that much
[0:46:18] <spirittiart> Can we just change the WEDDING VOWS tradition to WEDDING VOMS. there. fixed.
[0:46:21] <+QuestionableRadioactivity> Wait so if you hate the bride and groom, vomit on them
[0:46:24] <rytisone> just wrap a plastic bag around your head and puke all you want
[0:46:24] <+Polter_ge1st> So Woolie is just a coward
[0:46:25] <+Vancoolness> as long as you don't trow up on anyone.. everything will be fine..
[0:46:27] <Yukai_Yami> Weddings have like 35 plants. Just use the pot of one of them.
[0:46:31] <%xeromage> barf = pride
[0:46:33] <ZComiX> bleedPurple ResidentSleeper
[0:46:44] <Picia000123> Woolie is big coward for taking a barf bullet

[0:46:57] <+QuestionableRadioactivity> Reggie spitting raw facts
[0:46:58] <Picia000123> Because taking that bullet makes NO SENSE
[0:47:02] <tigerfang86> Reggie understands
[0:47:03] <%DatLatinoGuy> love is chemicals, Reggie
[0:47:09] <rytisone> there's always nicer purse
[0:47:10] <DatAsuna> My cousin made mine custom!
[0:47:13] <%QaizerArt> But what if you can't?
[0:47:19] <Picia000123> FUCK NO YOU W OULDNT
[0:47:22] <Yukai_Yami> Purses are also stupid expensive.
[0:47:24] <Milo_Oda> purses go out of style my guy
[0:47:26] <%mayorrev> @woolieversus I think damage can be easily avoided by emptying the purse before barfing in it
[0:47:27] <%DomPressesButtons> bodied
[0:47:27] <reonome> will you do that if your child's pet dies woolie
[0:47:35] <+VetInteKovira> Lol Woolie trying to argue with Pat always makes him look crazy
[0:47:38] <LoveYouDead> A new puse for the next barf LUL
[0:47:39] <+keyoray> Also, not all purses are replaceable. My dead grandma made me a custom leather purse. I will/have murder anyone who touches it.
[0:47:39] <@Solidus_113> it's been 40 minutes LUL
[0:47:40] <Picia000123> FUCKING PAY 5000$ for shit
[0:47:44] <+QuestionableRadioactivity> Woolie please just vomit on the floor
[0:47:47] <+QuestionableRadioactivity> plese
[0:47:48] <MassConnect> just find baby birds and vomit into them
[0:47:49] <SomersaultJustice> is woolie slowly transforming into pat?

[0:47:59] <brosephmike> Can this be put on the main channel?
[0:48:02] <DatAsuna> @mayorrev purses have zips and pckets tho, takes time to properly empty, and the stuff in those pockets are gonna stew in it
[0:48:09] <%xeromage> with barf stains
[0:48:12] <MKII> photoshop the stains out
[0:48:12] <TwinBat> woolie pls
[0:48:15] <+QuestionableRadioactivity> But the vomit smell
[0:48:17] <Picia000123> Why go through this much trouble
[0:48:24] <Picia000123> versus, bark on the floor
[0:48:30] <MKII> just ruin the wedding for an hour
[0:48:34] <Picia000123> This is madness
[0:48:39] <+VetInteKovira> All this work when there is a clean floor waiting to be barfed on
[0:48:43] <LoveYouDead> This is like a JoJo episode
[0:48:44] <fist_wizard_jay> speaking of puke and suits
[0:48:45] <+QuestionableRadioactivity> It's doesn't even ruinthe wedding
[0:48:46] <Yukai_Yami> Moral: keep Woolie away from booze at weddings
[0:48:48] <+keyoray> a wedding is not a marriage. who cares.
[0:48:58] <reonome> woolie you're ruining the wedding anyway just by puking in the vicinity
[0:48:58] <fist_wizard_jay> how about Ninja’s suit at the VGAs lol
[0:49:01] <%DatLatinoGuy> don't feed Woolie at weddings
[0:49:07] <+QuestionableRadioactivity> I'd feel worse if someone felt compelled to go to such lengths to cover this up
[0:49:10] <+QuestionableRadioactivity> just vomit
[0:49:11] <ZComiX> Woolie wants you to but this phone with a screen
[0:49:11] <fist_wizard_jay> Dont feed Woolie

[0:49:56] <Yukai_Yami> “Oh lemme check Woolie stream as I eat OH WAIT NO”
[0:50:00] <Picia000123> NO IT IS NOT

[0:52:04] <+Polter_ge1st> Not really
[0:52:04] <%DatLatinoGuy> it's weird but makes sense lol
[0:52:05] <BreakersAweigh> not really woolie
[0:52:07] <reasonance> I just tuned in, is he really still doing the barf thing?
[0:52:08] <+ClaudeMcGarren> no
[0:52:09] <viciousgrim> hi punch mom
[0:52:10] <%QaizerArt> @keyoray Paige said that you don't vomit in someone's purse those are sacred to girls
[0:52:11] <Explodincatz> super crazy
[0:52:12] <%mayorrev> woolie just empty the purse! :O
[0:52:12] <Make_me_mad> You threw up in a purse and fled the room! You already ruined the wedding!
[0:52:14] <MyNameIsRasus> no
[0:52:17] <+QuestionableRadioactivity> Because you're wrong
[0:52:18] <%25RPM> Press X to Doubt
[0:52:20] <+ClaudeMcGarren> its not crazy]
[0:52:20] <%Ecchigun> @WoolieVersus GET A PLASTIC BAG INSIDE THE PURSE
[0:52:20] <+Polter_ge1st> Woolie, you're replaceable
[0:52:22] <%xeromage> I feel like he's convinced me though
[0:52:23] <%Ecchigun> EZ PZ
[0:52:24] <+keyoray> woolie is wrong, he will figure it out
[0:52:24] <shieldecho> youre speaking very logically but arent considering the visceral emotional reaction
[0:52:25] <+VetInteKovira> Throw up that floor they have janitors
[0:52:25] <@SoushinSen> @benjisonfire that's the joke where i got compared to that character due to my sandbags
[0:52:26] <+eanscrale> Yes
[0:52:27] <reonome> because you're already ruining the wedding regardless
[0:52:27] <%Irridium> I understand the thought process but I still don't like it
[0:52:27] <%heartbbyy> am i the woolie one who completely agrees? lol makes sense to me
[0:52:28] <%jinking79> can u replace a fightstick with barf in it?
[0:52:29] <Picia000123> FUCKING
[0:52:29] <+QuestionableRadioactivity> Vomit on the floor, PLEASE
[0:52:30] <zaitje> because the janitor can just clean it up
[0:52:33] <Soulbishop> Why can’t you flip over the purse dump it out and then puke in it
[0:52:33] <Picia000123> WEDDING WONT SMELL
[0:52:34] <+mister___doctor> Nah u right
[0:52:34] <Sedrelic> its a good intention..but a really dumb solution
[0:52:35] <MKII> you dont throw out the wedding with the bathwater just because somebody vomited
[0:52:38] <DatAsuna> THink of it like not jumping on a grenade
[0:52:41] <undimcundi> Because it does not have that effect Woolie, it's ruined either way!
[0:52:41] <Picia000123> YOU'RE NUTS
[0:52:42] <MyNameIsRasus> JUST PUKE ON THE BRIDE
[0:52:43] <+QuestionableRadioactivity> What?
[0:52:43] <%xeromage> yeah. dump and barf is the best
[0:52:44] <DatAsuna> but instead you push someone else on it
[0:52:47] <+eanscrale> Dude, you don't know if they even gonna stick around, marriage is hard
[0:52:49] <reonome> you don't redo a wedding just because someone vomited!!!
[0:52:50] <%mayorrev> YEAH DUMP
[0:52:51] <+QuestionableRadioactivity> Dump and barf?
[0:52:52] <BreakersAweigh> because the wedding is ruined regardless
[0:52:55] <%QaizerArt> @WoolieVersus Vomiting in the purse or in your shirt would basically draw a whole amount of attention which would make the wedding awkward as you shuffle out with the vomit purse.
[0:52:56] <spirittiart> Reggie PlEeeaaAaS put some sense to this madness
[0:52:57] <%xeromage> REGGIE SOLVED IT AS USUAL
[0:52:58] <Graxe_> If you absolutely have to barf in a purse, make sure it's empty
[0:52:58] <LoveYouDead> @Picia000123 DMC : WEDDING WONT SMELL
[0:53:05] <+QuestionableRadioactivity> GENIUS
[0:53:07] <Graxe_> Out of courtesy
[0:53:09] <+QuestionableRadioactivity> Yes that works
[0:53:10] <+keyoray> @QaizerArt I agree. I have no idea what Woolie is trying to sell. Just don't buy it.
[0:53:11] <BreakersAweigh> THERE WE GO
[0:53:13] <shieldecho> as someone who is very anti purse i am VERY down with this honestly
[0:53:13] <MyNameIsRasus> That's better
[0:53:13] <Picia000123> @LoveYouDead That's a good title
[0:53:14] <+QuestionableRadioactivity> Nailed it
[0:53:18] <%DatLatinoGuy> problem solved
[0:53:19] <%luckybudman> YES
[0:53:19] <+KingOfTheGeats> I'm ok with that
[0:53:19] <Setaro> eww lmao
[0:53:22] <adamisfruit> Puke smell is cleaned better than Woolie wants to believe
[0:53:23] <Make_me_mad> It doesn't matter WHERE you vomit at that point, you have already ruined the event when you are vomiting anywhere.
[0:53:24] <Sporkgasm> Reggie Figured It Out
[0:53:25] <Explodincatz> Barf Bga
[0:53:26] <DatAsuna> Just pull a pat, stand up, barf on the floor and declare they'll be divorced in 3 years anyway
[0:53:27] <+QuestionableRadioactivity> Punchmom stop
[0:53:27] <Soulbishop> You just dump the purse then if you puke
[0:53:29] <reonome> "oh hey someone threw out a perfectly good purse!"
[0:53:29] <+VetInteKovira> You aren’t ruining a whole wedding, you’re barf isn’t that important they will move past it
[0:53:29] <%DatLatinoGuy> Stef noooooo
[0:53:29] <robot_mug> DansGame
[0:53:30] <Lelfro> What if you mistime it and barf on the floor and the items on the floor
[0:53:32] <+Artumoc> just joined, cant escape the puke talk
[0:53:34] <Yukai_Yami> Okay, that’s better...at least
[0:53:34] <+ClaudeMcGarren> seal the barf
[0:53:35] <MKII> purse with ziplock technology
[0:53:40] <undimcundi> What if it oiverflows though Woolie?
[0:53:44] <+eanscrale> If you feel that bad, you shouldn't BE at a wedding
[0:53:46] <@SoushinSen> Woolie, brave man testing the limit and boundery of his relationship.
[0:53:49] <+keyoray> @DatAsuna I want to do this. Thank you very much, this sounds awesome.
[0:53:51] <Make_me_mad> If you thought you might throw up you should never have been at the wedding.
[0:53:53] <zayasu> no
[0:53:55] <+Polter_ge1st> Punchmom is a real one for enabling her man's behavior
[0:53:55] <%25RPM> Vomit into girl friends mouth... PROBLEM SOLVED

[0:54:46] <%ozzrabbit> Your explanation makes a lot of sense, and I agree with your assessment of the situation. I’m sorry this comment led to this, it was not my intentions to make you out to be crazy.
[0:54:46] <spirittiart> GO
[0:54:47] <+EmptyMug> What about the second barf?
[0:54:48] <+BuffaTV> This is why we need matt, pat is too much of an influence on woolie lol
[0:54:48] <adamisfruit> BARF SMELL GETS CLEANED EASY
[0:54:49] <muniea3> if you have two seconds you have time to run
[0:54:54] <brosephmike> @WoolieVersus Tell Steph to have a sacrificial bag for emergency barf
[0:55:01] <+QuestionableRadioactivity> Oh yeah absolutely
[0:55:02] <Picia000123> If you have time then go to bathroom
[0:55:10] <Picia000123> if not, time to barf on the floor
[0:55:14] <Dao_Puppy> Wait, is "barfing into your girlfriend's purse" a euphamism for something? Cuz I might have different opinions then.
[0:55:14] <+Polter_ge1st> Janitors have jobs for a reason.
[0:55:14] <@Solidus_113> You gotta know when you feel yourself salivating
[0:55:14] <reonome> I've seen alcohol barf
[0:55:16] <Milo_Oda> @WoolieVersus are we not addressing the audible HUERRRGH, huuuuuueeeee ppuhh. youre splitting into a louis vuitton handbag
[0:55:19] <Yukai_Yami> Punch mom, get an emergency purse to parties
[0:55:21] <%xeromage> In the purse, you carry a barf bag?
[0:55:27] <Soulbishop> Nothing we came up with it it’s a perfect plan
[0:55:28] <%xeromage> Super solved it
[0:55:28] <%25RPM> This cannot continue.

[0:55:34] <DatAsuna> Am girl, stay the fuck away from my handbag
[0:55:35] <+keyoray> wait, wouldn't the wedding party be suspicious of food poisoning?
[0:55:36] <+QuestionableRadioactivity> Alcohol barf is mostly liquid, food barf is mostly bolas
[0:55:44] <reonome> LUL
[0:55:53] <DatAsuna> Reggie's SEEN THIS ATTEMPTED?
[0:56:04] <rytisone> just carry a hat with youself
[0:56:04] <%DatLatinoGuy> LMAO
[0:56:04] <spirittiart> S-So.. Purses are for barfing? AM I getting this RIGHT?
[0:56:05] <undimcundi> Imagine if someone puked in your fightstick.
[0:56:09] <Yukai_Yami> I think dumping all the purse items would cause more noise and concern than hurting in a water pitcher or under a table.
[0:56:11] <Picia000123> FLOOOOOOOOOOOR
[0:56:14] <+Polter_ge1st> Woolie by your logic, you are replaceable
[0:56:17] <%DatLatinoGuy> HAHAHHAHAHA
[0:56:19] <+VetInteKovira> Saw that puke tech irl and It didn’t work
[0:56:19] <@Solidus_113> Thanks Chapelle
[0:56:20] <Sedrelic> is like dumping on your vergil-s
[0:56:26] <xeromage> @undimcundi LOL
[0:56:30] <adamisfruit> WEDDINGS ARE NOT SO SACRED
[0:56:36] <+QuestionableRadioactivity> Indivisible when?
[0:56:38] <+ClaudeMcGarren> @keyoray sure but time can pass between trying the food and when it comes time for it to be cooked and served in mass
[0:56:52] <acedeone> I barfed mcdonalds nuggets in the car as a kid and the memory and smell both linger dude..
[0:56:54] <%DatLatinoGuy> real purse > wedding purse
[0:56:56] <%25RPM> Please stop Woolie its already dead.
[0:56:58] <Picia000123> it has sentimental value
[0:57:01] <Milo_Oda> you can absolutley clean puke outta car i can clean puke outta your care for 10$
[0:57:06] <+QuestionableRadioactivity> DnB
[0:57:10] <%QaizerArt> Yo what about just barfing in a water pitcher tho
[0:57:12] <+Breaknoon> make DnB your BnB
[0:57:16] <Lelfro> Dragon Ball it
[0:57:18] <acedeone> that car is tainted
[0:57:18] <%QaizerArt> wouldn't that make things a lot easier to clean?
[0:57:19] <DatAsuna> I've had my handmade bag for 7 years!
[0:57:23] <acedeone> if its inside
[0:57:23] <2tailedd3rps> HahaDoge
[0:57:28] <%DatLatinoGuy> just barf on the Father
[0:57:32] <reonome> the WEDDING IS ALREADY RUINED
[0:57:33] <ZComiX> Hey woolie, let me propose an alternative. Just carry a plastic bag around with you for emergencies. Or keep a plastic bag in the clutch for your vomit.
[0:57:37] <+keyoray> @ClaudeMcGarren oh yea. I'm immuno-compromised, so i'm extra paranoid of everything.
[0:57:37] <Picia000123> this is incredible
[0:57:38] <spirittiart> Get cargo pants, barf into every pocket
[0:57:42] <Explodincatz> Woolie barf in a bag on stream so we know how it works properly
[0:57:42] <+QuestionableRadioactivity> This chat ruined my wedding
[0:57:46] <zaitje> what if the purse is not big enough and the puke starts to spill over?
[0:57:46] <%Irridium> just hose that shit off if its on the outside
[0:57:46] <Samuraiflame> I like this compromise
[0:57:49] <Milo_Oda> youd also spray debris onto other cars
[0:57:56] <+VetInteKovira> I’m so confused because by barring you will be exposed there is no hiding it
[0:57:56] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:58:01] <Graxe_> Yeah, what if it's a small purse?
[0:58:03] <+VetInteKovira> Barfing*
[0:58:03] <@Solidus_113> Barfing outside a car could cause a slick for an accident though @WoolieVersus
[0:58:04] <%QaizerArt> @WoolieVersus What about puking in a water pitcher though?
[0:58:04] <+iFranzC> Smell is on the outside.
[0:58:04] <Graxe_> And can't hold it all?
[0:58:05] <spirittiart> Wedding Voms
[0:58:09] <+CrowGuy> Some makeup you can't get
[0:58:09] <%25RPM> THE VOMIT WAR STARTS NOW
[0:58:11] <Picia000123> you will survive barf on the floor Woolie
[0:58:11] <Yukai_Yami> !uptime
[0:58:11] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 58 minutes and 13 seconds
[0:58:13] <+QuestionableRadioactivity> Vomcast
[0:58:14] <rosemon5001> you all are underestimating the smell that shit will get trough a safe doesnt matter what strategy you use
[0:58:15] <Picia000123> it will be fine
[0:58:17] <+ClaudeMcGarren> @keyoray i getchu im a cancer survivor ive had a many of things get me sick at one point or another i feel you
[0:58:18] <+keyoray> nope. Limited Edition Makeup. Woolie is wrong.
[0:58:20] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Lelfro
[0:58:21] <Haarute> just puke on your so's purse, it's the only logical answer.
[0:58:21] <+Prevot> Nope
[0:58:23] <@SoushinSen> This discussion just roves to me that all wedding tables should have disposable bags under the tables for emergencies.
[0:58:25] <Yukai_Yami> An hour of vomcast, huh
[0:58:29] <+iFranzC> Barfcast?
[0:58:36] <+QuestionableRadioactivity> Barfcast is good
[0:58:39] <LoveYouDead> Put at the shie mat in the car
[0:58:40] <SomersaultJustice> Woolie will barf it out
[0:58:42] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus Put this on the channel
[0:58:44] <reonome> yeah the sound of somebody loudly vomiting into a purse isn't going to ruin it at all
[0:58:46] <Make_me_mad> @WoolieVersus You are already ruining the day by vomiting. Stop making yourself sound like a hero for fucking up someone else's property in the process!
[0:58:48] <spirittiart> Vomtastic
[0:58:48] <ZComiX> Hey woolie, let me propose an alternative. Just carry a plastic bag around with you for emergencies. Or keep a plastic bag in the clutch for your vomit.
[0:58:51] <acedeone> you party and dance and no slip on the dancefloor
[0:58:51] <Picia000123> No we didnt
[0:58:52] <%ultrasparkseid> "air tight"
[0:58:54] <%xeromage> DUMP AND CHUCK
[0:58:55] <%DatLatinoGuy> barf tight
[0:58:56] <LoveYouDead> Barf at the shoe mat if ur in a car
[0:58:57] <MassConnect> if people aren't vomiting you're not marrying the right person
[0:58:59] <Lelfro> Vomit on the floor for maximum damage
[0:59:11] <%mayorrev> @woolieversus dump and barf is a legit strategy
[0:59:16] <SomersaultJustice> you have to vomit on the floor and then roll around on it for maximum effect
[0:59:19] <Yukai_Yami> The REAL cast was the purses we barfed along the way
[0:59:22] <+iFranzC> Woolie’s goal is noble, not necessarily optimal.
[0:59:23] <+QuestionableRadioactivity> Wow
[0:59:24] <Picia000123> Woolie just can't take vomit on the floor for some reason
[0:59:25] <%Irridium> so if you're the one getting married can you just barf and force everyone to stay? Your wedding after all
[0:59:26] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> just puke on whatever youre sitting on instead of the floor
[0:59:27] <acedeone> slow down the flow
[0:59:28] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> you maniacs
[0:59:29] <Graxe_> Don't get sick
[0:59:32] <Graxe_> Don't get hit
[0:59:32] <+QuestionableRadioactivity> Hey Woolie
[0:59:34] <+QuestionableRadioactivity> Drink it
[0:59:37] <spirittiart> Make purse out of puke, and upgrade it with your tummy juice
[0:59:37] <%mayorrev> DON'T GET SICK 4Head
[0:59:39] <+QuestionableRadioactivity> Drink the vomit
[0:59:42] <%DatLatinoGuy> don't get sick
[0:59:43] <+QuestionableRadioactivity> Chug it
[0:59:43] <SomersaultJustice> it's turned into fighting games again: don't get hit
[0:59:43] <%QaizerArt> I'm pushing Puke in a Water Pitcher to minimize damage
[0:59:44] <%mayorrev> 4Head 4Head 4Head
[0:59:45] <MKII> you'd think a space where an event is taking place would be ready to clean up a little vomit
[0:59:45] <%DatLatinoGuy> easy
[0:59:47] <zaitje> Do weddings don't have trashcans?
[0:59:50] <MKII> walk around with a bag of saw dust
[0:59:50] <brosephmike> Now we should just prepare for everything
[0:59:51] <+keyoray> VoteNay VoteNay VoteNay
[0:59:52] <+QuestionableRadioactivity> Just swallow it
[0:59:53] <+CrowGuy> Can you people not swallow your vomit back down?
[0:59:54] <+VetInteKovira> The person next to you that sees you barf into that purse is gonna be going crazy
[0:59:55] <Graxe_> Why not just bring your own purse?
[1:00:00] <%xeromage> LAPTOP BAG?
[1:00:00] <+QuestionableRadioactivity> Swallow the vomit, Woolie
[1:00:01] <Tubit> LUL
[1:00:03] <adamisfruit> don’t forget the sound of barf mid ceremony

[1:01:07] <Haarute> SOMEONE listening to this saga will inevitably live the puke scenario at some point and they'll KNOW what to do then. good job figuring it out.
[1:01:08] <+QuestionableRadioactivity> @beserkergaruk Absolutely is
[1:01:12] <LoveYouDead> remove your shirt and make it into a bag by knotting it
[1:01:13] <%heartbbyy> woolie is right as always chat's dumb
[1:01:14] <spirittiart> "YoU KnOuW WhAt I mEan?"
[1:01:16] <Samuraiflame> JUMPED ON THE PUKE GRENADE

[1:01:20] <%CaptainPileDriver> YOU'RE GONNA LEAK ALL OVER THE PLACE
[1:01:25] <+eanscrale> MAKE IT STOP!
[1:01:25] <%mayorrev> woolie you're super right tbh
[1:01:27] <+QuestionableRadioactivity> Is crazy talk metastasising?
[1:01:28] <Lelfro> Vomit goblin
[1:01:30] <adamisfruit> The sound alone ruins the ceremony
[1:01:30] <clueless_reaper> I can't believe its still barf
[1:01:30] <reonome> what if you puke at the atlar
[1:01:33] <MKII> is this crazy talk act 3
[1:01:34] <acedeone> keep sawdust on hand too tho
[1:01:34] <undimcundi> You're not a hero Woolie, but I get you.
[1:01:35] <%CaptainPileDriver> YOUR SHIRT IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO KEEP IT IN
[1:01:37] <jack_s1n> Sounds a lot like emotional blackmail woolie
[1:01:42] <+ClaudeMcGarren> hot box the fumews
[1:01:45] <%DatLatinoGuy> nah, I'm with Woolie on this
[1:01:46] <%Irridium> I mean he's not wrong there the stench is the actual worst

[1:01:58] <Yukai_Yami> Just don’t eat at weddings, Woolie
[1:01:59] <+Prevot> Woolie was the real pat all along
[1:02:00] <%Irridium> and the aftertaste too. fucking ugh
[1:02:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> IT'S NOT
[1:02:06] <+QuestionableRadioactivity> Oh my god woolie
[1:02:06] <%ultrasparkseid> LOGICAL?!
[1:02:07] <Milo_Oda> thats love <3
[1:02:07] <jo_vo> Jesus Christ, Woolie is STILL salty about this conversation?!
[1:02:09] <+CrowGuy> Woolie you are going to ruin a ceremony when you puke during it no matter what you do with the vomit.
[1:02:11] <zaitje> this sounds more like a problem for woolie himself than anybody else in the wedding day
[1:02:11] <+QuestionableRadioactivity> LOGICAL?
[1:02:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> THIS IS PAT LEVELS OF THINKING AND IT'S WRONG
[1:02:19] <Yukai_Yami> Logical??????????
[1:02:23] <ZComiX> I would rather you bard on your shirt vs someone else bag. That’s just me but your SO seems fine with it
[1:02:26] <spirittiart> "I live that purse. Who you wearing?"
[1:02:27] <DatAsuna> Boy I sure loved when my wedding guest barfed in his GFs purse and ran out mid reception
[1:02:30] <BreakersAweigh> i understand the process woolie
[1:02:32] <@SoushinSen> It's only logical in the mind of a mad man.
[1:02:37] <Sedrelic> the shirt solution was dumb tho...purse is less stupid
[1:02:39] <Captain_Joe1911> apatOrange
[1:02:39] <+QuestionableRadioactivity> Logic of the insane
[1:02:40] <adamisfruit> “LOGICAL”
[1:02:40] <@SoushinSen> and y'all saying i'm the crazy one.
[1:02:40] <%DatLatinoGuy> LUL
[1:02:40] <reonome> lol minh
[1:02:45] <Make_me_mad> The fact that you think you are saving ANYTHING by throwing up into a purse instead is insane.
[1:02:45] <jo_vo> @zaitje This sounds like a Woolie fear for HIS wedding day
[1:02:46] <+QuestionableRadioactivity> "Logic"?
[1:02:47] <Graxe_> Pat also says that his stuff is airtight
[1:02:52] <LoveYouDead> WHat do u mean the shirt is too weak ? Is the barf the shirt hard counter ?
[1:02:52] <+VetInteKovira> Make sure to throw the word logical in your arguement to make it sounds right
[1:02:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> IT'S NOT WOOLIE, IT WILL LEAK THROUGH THE SHIRT YOU FUCK
[1:02:56] <%mayorrev> Minh pls
[1:02:58] <BigLegs911> woolie all that stuff could possibly 100s of dollars.
[1:02:59] <jack_s1n> IF YOU WERE A GOOD PERSON You WOULDN'T SUBJECT SOMEONE TO THAT

[1:16:37] <+MrRabbles> Woolian ethics
[1:16:41] <%CaptainPileDriver> THE SHIRT WILL LEAK
[1:16:50] <%CaptainPileDriver> THERE'S MORE VOMIT THAN A DROP OF REDBULL
[1:16:51] <+QuestionableRadioactivity> @Sporkgasm This is an amazing point
[1:16:54] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @BreakersAweigh
[1:17:13] <DreamPhantasy77> Fill your jacket front pocket with scented saw dust
[1:17:19] <Graxe_> The average volume of vomit after a quick google search is around 800 ml
[1:17:22] <DatAsuna> Just get a cyborg body that cannot barf
[1:17:26] <SomersaultJustice> just wear a suit with a barf pattern so when you barf on it it will blend in with the suit
[1:17:27] <Heartless_01> lol
[1:17:28] <Graxe_> Which is a lot more than a can or Red Bull or Monster
[1:17:38] <spirittiart> YES, Reggie is genius! Wear garbage bag to a wedding!
[1:17:41] <BreakersAweigh> aw man i can't post the clip of the test
[1:17:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> IT'S NOT A TRUTH AT ALL
[1:17:50] <%jinking79> woolieTRASH
[1:17:53] <+QuestionableRadioactivity> "TRUTH"
[1:17:54] <Haarute> "my truth" oh no
[1:17:59] <reonome> OR IF YOU DON'T HAVE A GF
[1:18:02] <+tankusmaximus7> Maybe your Truth
[1:18:04] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> Woolie's Alternative Facts
[1:18:05] <Graxe_> Then why are you arguing it like it's an objective truth?
[1:18:07] <+Prevot> Woolie will never reach the truth
[1:18:11] <DatAsuna> Not every purse!
[1:18:22] <stphor> Woolie no
[1:18:24] <Yukai_Yami> “My” truth is not “the” truth
[1:18:26] <+QuestionableRadioactivity> Use someone else's purse, you mean?
[1:18:28] <Graxe_> Like, I get it.
[1:18:30] <@Squdnate> Why not just vomit on the floor like a normal person would
[1:18:32] <%ultrasparkseid> A sacrifice of nothing
[1:18:34] <%ironohki> Hi I just got here OH GOD ARE WE STILL TALKING ABOUT BARF
[1:18:35] <Graxe_> If it's the only best option, then sure.
[1:18:37] <DatAsuna> Can't go back 7 years and replace my handmade 18th birthday one
[1:18:40] <%CaptainPileDriver> fuck OOFFF WOOLIE
[1:18:40] <rytisone> Woolie carrying weight of the world
[1:18:44] <+QuestionableRadioactivity> @Squdnate We've already tried to labour this point
[1:18:44] <spirittiart> I think all of this is written in DIO's diary
[1:18:49] <+Fenlig> Can I barf into your shirt @WoolieVersus?
[1:18:51] <undimcundi> You'll take the weight of the world, and slip on the barf that leaks out.
[1:18:52] <adamisfruit> Classic poisoning of the well
[1:18:53] <%heartbbyy> why some people get timed out for using caps and some dont
[1:18:57] <stphor> What a hero
[1:18:57] <reonome> I feel like I'm being gaslit
[1:18:59] <Picia000123> Woolie, my aunt would slap the shit out of you LUL
[1:19:03] <%CaptainPileDriver> your inner pat is coming out
[1:19:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> I CAME FOR WOOLIE, NOT PAT
[1:19:11] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:19:12] <DatAsuna> Woolie Madden: Not barfing in your GFs purse should be illegal
[1:19:15] <stphor> FBtouchdown
[1:19:21] <spirittiart> Who?
[1:19:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> HOW DID WE GET HERE AGAIN
[1:19:31] <+QuestionableRadioactivity> Oh wait we're playing videogames

[1:19:50] <adamisfruit> @woolieversus I don’t have to go home and live with the bride and groom
[1:19:51] <+QuestionableRadioactivity> Vomit games
[1:19:59] <spirittiart> It's not the goal, but the barfs we gathered onthe way
[1:19:59] <Picia000123> shit on Ajna all day every day
[1:20:08] <Haarute> @WoolieVersus have you tried razmi's lvl3 in melee for double attack? it's very useful against armored groups.
[1:20:16] <anAngryHamster> Dhar did nothing wrong!
[1:20:19] <@Solidus_113> NAGA RIDER
[1:20:20] <%CaptainPileDriver> i feel so mad over nothing
[1:20:25] <+Prevot> Wait i haven't been watching the l pwhen did ajna become a gyaru
[1:20:33] <%mayorrev> YEYEYEYE
[1:20:34] <+theAncopro> don't bark on the floor, unless it's dhar's grave
[1:20:35] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> ♬ I wish that some way, somehow, that could save everyone from barf, but the truth is that I'm only one Srub! ♬
[1:20:40] <derss2134> Dhar did nothing wrong
[1:21:01] <reonome> and now dhar can never do anything again
[1:21:04] <adamisfruit> Dhar did nothing wrong
[1:21:13] <Yukai_Yami> Some things never change
[1:21:19] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> You have to Launch to Potemkin Buster!
[1:21:36] <+theAncopro> Dad's Dead, Dad's Killer is Dead, and Dad's Killer's Dad is also dead
[1:21:47] <alexandrecau> can't believe zebei is fucking dead
[1:21:48] <Yukai_Yami> I love Naga’s block. You see his real body.

[1:23:48] <@Solidus_113> I find cannon drill is still the best option to start fights
[1:24:19] <stphor> Biiiiiig combo
[1:24:30] <%ozzrabbit> That’s an Orboros. It’s another monster form Greek mythology.
[1:24:33] <someyounguy1> evil has come and so have i

[1:25:43] <Sternold123> is this one of those games woolie likes because the MC hits his fetish-requirement?
[1:25:56] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> NAGA RIDER IS THE KEWLEST
[1:26:03] <Milo_Oda> @WoolieVersus Phoebe's grab is her most damaging attack, for max damage you'll want to use other characters to launcher>grab>launcher>grab
[1:26:29] <@Solidus_113> Elevator goes to the mansion
[1:26:29] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1204820081542402050?s=19

[1:26:43] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> Woolie, scrape bottom
[1:26:58] <Naho_Saenoki> Kuuga didn't have a secondary rider, but the policeman who filled that role was the COOLEST.
[1:27:51] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> Buy he didnt!
[1:27:51] <brosephmike> Dhar did nothing wrong
[1:28:02] <Yukai_Yami> Dhar did nothing wrong
[1:28:13] <+theAncopro> Dhar was wrong and Ajna was SUPER wrong
[1:28:17] <MassConnect> Dhar barfed in a purse
[1:28:26] <oAznoUta> Ajna did all the wrong
[1:28:29] <Mariakko> Dhar did many things right
[1:28:46] <Yukai_Yami> Water mom!!
[1:29:10] <Mvrdok_> If Dhar did nothing wrong then why he's dead? Kappa
[1:29:15] <@Squdnate> Why does this conversation style immediately remind me of YIIK
[1:29:33] <+theAncopro> don't talk about Thorani's ocean of milk
[1:29:43] <brosephmike> @Mvrdok_ because he was dead right
[1:29:48] <BreakersAweigh> don't stare at your mother like that woolie

[1:31:04] <adamisfruit> Dhar isn’t to blame for any of his wrong doings
[1:31:17] <@Solidus_113> Go back and save the game before going in the elevator @WoolieVersus
[1:31:17] <Milo_Oda> @haarute do we know that yet Kappa
[1:31:20] <brosephmike> Pogo on rocks?
[1:31:31] <Picia000123> the problem is, Dhar was given shit
[1:31:43] <Picia000123> Ajna does not
[1:31:59] <+mister___doctor> "I'm just saying Bruddah, Ajna knows what shes doing"

[2:02:06] <%jinking79> doesn't have her DP yet?
[2:02:14] <Milo_Oda> does woolie know about the dashing pole jump?
[2:02:14] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:02:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Does Woolie not have up+Y yet?
[2:02:41] <@Solidus_113> he's getting it now

[2:05:07] <@Solidus_113> There was one
[2:05:34] <%mayorrev> "please fix immediately"
[2:05:54] <+theAncopro> it may be the lie, but maybe not
[2:06:19] <Yukai_Yami> Times like this, that run option would be swell
[2:06:52] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I see Woolie is going for an air juggle build. I had build with Lei, Razmi, and Bambo Guy
[2:06:55] <MassConnect> controversial opinion: hair water isn't gross, but hair touching floor is gross
[2:07:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> yeah, thats reasonable
[2:07:34] <+theAncopro> that's bullshit blazing
[2:07:37] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Especially het hair water is super clean ans restorative XD
[2:07:51] <@Solidus_113> that's still a wall
[2:08:12] <%BallerSwagBro9k> You have long right up then left
[2:08:18] <%BallerSwagBro9k> to go
[2:08:20] <Yukai_Yami> Why aren’t certain ceilings and walls classified as such?
[2:08:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yeah the map is not great
[2:08:33] <@Solidus_113> MIKE Z!!!!!!
[2:08:37] <Picia000123> I like how in this big map there is not that much to discover :P
[2:09:09] <Picia000123> Almost like this didn't need to be a metroidvania game
[2:09:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Not if youre a ninja
[2:09:33] <+theAncopro> im guessing the border on the map is generated, so when there's no space inbetween walls it assumes it's open
[2:09:34] <Picia000123> you right
[2:09:34] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1204820081542402050?s=19

[2:51:45] <Monkeyweed21> you are like 10 to 20 minutes from getting more mobility
[2:52:20] <%ozzrabbit> Minh, get ready to fast forward these many attempts
[2:52:33] <MassConnect> looks like invisible wall to me
[2:52:55] <%ozzrabbit> Never mind
[2:52:56] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1204820081542402050?s=19

[2:55:02] <DatAsuna> KINDA
[2:55:05] <%Stan_Van01> Stan_Van01 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:55:07] <%Stan_Van01> Stan_Van01's Sub shared rewards to 5 others in Chat! 
[2:55:13] <Picia000123> WHO CARES BABY
[2:55:30] <Picia000123> Repercussions, what's that
[2:55:30] <MassConnect> Dhar wasn't a chick anyway
[2:55:42] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Monkeyweed21
[2:55:45] <karl_rex> You killed a guy but WHO CARES?
[2:55:53] <+theAncopro> Zebei called this from the start
[2:56:19] <+jorgamund> "hey... are we in the backstory for a future Demon Boss?"
[2:56:19] <@Solidus_113> is that enough for the next upgrade?
[2:56:23] <%jinking79> hey the world end at this point anything go's
[2:56:41] <@Solidus_113> next level of defense I think
[2:56:46] <%ozzrabbit> Hey, chat, aren’t the heart meters in the game a reference to how much Ajna likes them, not how much they like Ajna?
[2:56:58] <Picia000123> it's their S link
[2:57:16] <Picia000123> kinda
[2:57:37] <Picia000123> the bigger the number, the stronger they are
[2:57:39] <Monkeyweed21> Iron kingdom also works
[2:57:46] <@Solidus_113> both work
[2:57:53] <Picia000123> or something, i don't know, it is not important
[2:58:05] <adamisfruit> The no-sell of the teammate death is weird
[2:58:08] <@Solidus_113> IK will get you more "content"
[2:58:29] <@Solidus_113> Unless Kanuul had a thing I forget
[2:58:49] <adamisfruit> Like, the tone is like “don’t worry, I’m sure he’ll be back!” But I don’t know if that’s accurate
[2:59:04] <Monkeyweed21> @Solidus_113 both of them immediately give mobility
[2:59:14] <Picia000123> it's not
[2:59:16] <+theAncopro> and maybe even NEW friends
[2:59:18] <Louie_Salmon> That line read from Ajna was really good
[3:00:22] <Picia000123> is it?
[3:00:22] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:00:26] <Picia000123> is it really?
[3:00:42] <@Solidus_113> There's fucking slime EVERYWHERE
[3:00:43] <karl_rex> Hey there kid who just turned into a demon I ran away from and left
[3:00:47] <+theAncopro> show lips
[3:01:03] <Picia000123> SAY NO MORE
[3:01:09] <Monkeyweed21> everyone's like who?
[3:01:30] <Monkeyweed21> Dhar? You mean the stain on the ground
[3:01:37] <Picia000123> would be nice to see villagers get mad at her or something I dunno
[3:01:43] <Picia000123> SOMETHING
[3:01:48] <@Solidus_113> you might need timestop
[3:02:09] <@Solidus_113> YEAH
[3:02:20] <+theAncopro> you're one to talk ajna
[3:02:21] <adamisfruit> Dhar got dusted just Ajna could get marginally more responsible.
[3:02:29] <Picia000123> you're both assholes
[3:02:31] <gridib> Those kind of spike puzzles are a later upgrade, woolz
[3:02:32] <Monkeyweed21> @Picia000123 the people from Lhan are SUPER PISSED at her when you talk to them in Ashwat
[3:02:37] <karl_rex> WHY is everyone so trusting?
[3:02:41] <Picia000123> @Monkeyweed21 true
[3:02:45] <@Solidus_113> How can you hate that punch arm
[3:02:55] <Picia000123> but there is no fighting villagers or nothing
[3:03:06] <Picia000123> Like, give me Something
[3:03:26] <%redrins> I hate her voice
[3:03:51] <Monkeyweed21> @Picia000123 the people in every location are also kinda pissed whenever they find out she's responsible
[3:03:54] <brosephmike> Person 1: We should add more to this script at some point. Person 2: We already released the game.
[3:04:05] <@Solidus_113> you're dying
[3:04:05] <SleepyMaribo> time for the worst enemy types in the game
[3:04:08] <+theAncopro> checkyour health
[3:04:10] <adamisfruit> They just joked about “Dharring” Kanpan
[3:04:30] <@Solidus_113> ranged attacks only
[3:04:49] <Picia000123> @Monkeyweed21 Why some of them ain't at my throat, tho, also my party is "it's fiiinnee"
[3:05:02] <SleepyMaribo> yes you do need ghinsing
[3:05:03] <Picia000123> @Monkeyweed21 It all feels simply too little
[3:05:59] <Monkeyweed21> @Picia000123 Ajna's greatest crimes are killing a mass murderer and turning into a giant and crushing a monastery
[3:06:22] <Picia000123> @Monkeyweed21 Also, all the other things she did to the cities
[3:06:42] <adamisfruit> @monkeyweed21 We just going to skip how she released Armageddon?
[3:06:44] <Monkeyweed21> @Picia000123 The party gets that she learned a lesson and everyone else is kinda terrified of her Heruka form
[3:07:02] <Picia000123> @Monkeyweed21 And that is what too little to me
[3:07:34] <Picia000123> @Monkeyweed21 Someone in her party should be mad at her
[3:07:34] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:07:34] <HoIyShadows> heyyoo doodz!!
[3:08:40] <+chesterr01> HeyGuys
[3:08:49] <Picia000123> Woolie
[3:08:53] <Haarute> i wonder who made the choice of getting 4 melees in here
[3:09:22] <+theAncopro> unless you just dont get hit
[3:09:24] <adamisfruit> 3 melee, 0 healers
[3:09:31] <Picia000123> nice
[3:10:19] <@Solidus_113> it's the up attack on the ground
[3:10:35] <TheSaltminer> COMBAT ADJUDICATOR
[3:10:50] <+Cymen90> Still on Indivsible? Shoulda just finished Sekiro :)
[3:11:32] <Picia000123> yay
[3:11:37] <+Cymen90> But for real, do what you enjoy!
[3:11:59] <gridib> Kampan is the best party member with the coolest special IMO
[3:12:10] <karl_rex> YEAH Riot
[3:12:16] <Picia000123> YEYEYE
[3:12:18] <@Solidus_113> Slime riot
[3:12:21] <gunsrlove> ...Why is everyone suddenly jolly fakin 'ell
[3:12:23] <adamisfruit> Woolie she’s in your lp intro
[3:12:36] <+Cymen90> Gooey robots? Sounds like heaven.
[3:12:59] <Monkeyweed21> @Picia000123 I agree that they're a little too quick to forgive Ajna's fuck up but the alternative is that they refuse to help the only hope the world has cause she killed 1 person by mistake
[3:13:14] <+Cymen90> Oh, I wasn't here, did his opinion on Indivisible go sour?
[3:13:18] <%SanguineQuest> Woolie, you need to embrace the Saturday Morning Cartoon philosophy
[3:13:27] <Picia000123> @Monkeyweed21 It's not that they should refuse, it's that they don't give her ANY shit for what she did
[3:13:41] <Picia000123> @Monkeyweed21 Which is simply ridiculous
[3:14:02] <+Polter_ge1st> Nah but fuck her though
[3:14:11] <+Cymen90> Oh, did Woolie realize the story stinks? Oh nooo
[3:14:22] <karl_rex> But down with the aristocracy
[3:14:24] <+theAncopro> everybody gettin fucked
[3:14:28] <%SanguineQuest> HOW
[3:14:28] <+LTKonnor> YEET THE PRINCESS
[3:14:36] <+theAncopro> LOL
[3:14:36] <+Cymen90> monkaS
[3:14:36] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1204820081542402050?s=19
[3:14:37] <+LTKonnor> THEY YEETED HER
[3:14:41] <%SanguineQuest> Oh dang.
[3:14:41] <karl_rex> D-Did she just die
[3:14:41] <Louie_Salmon> Okay actually
[3:14:42] <+theAncopro> oh dang
[3:14:43] <Picia000123> HAAHA
[3:14:44] <DatAsuna> HOORAY
[3:14:50] <+Cymen90> TOO BAD WE DID NOT SEE THAT
[3:14:56] <Louie_Salmon> That sounded MEATY
[3:14:56] <karl_rex> Slime princess
[3:15:03] <Lelfro> Slime from dreams Kreygasm
[3:15:03] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Cymen90
[3:15:08] <Yukai_Yami> The budget ran out there
[3:15:12] <Monkeyweed21> @Picia000123 true, but its at least nice that Ajna is actively giving herself shit for being stupid
[3:15:18] <+shootbang_exe> dreamslime
[3:15:21] <+Cymen90> @Yukai_Yami For a single still picture?
[3:15:26] <+theAncopro> Put her in!
[3:15:27] <+ConLin_Arts_> I love Kampan
[3:15:29] <@Solidus_113> Go into training mode with Kampan, she has some SETUPS
[3:15:34] <+ConLin_Arts_> Kampan is a BEAST
[3:15:35] <Louie_Salmon> Death is pretty hype, at the end of the day
[3:15:38] <+theAncopro> her super is worth everything
[3:15:41] <+Cymen90> BUT it is DONE BADLY
[3:15:52] <Yukai_Yami> @cymen90 Yup XD
[3:16:00] <Picia000123> @Monkeyweed21 It really neede more time in the oven
[3:16:18] <DatAsuna> inb4 pat
[3:16:18] <+Cymen90> Vegeta took SEASONS to be decent and arguably took an entire series to be a good guy
[3:16:21] <Monkeyweed21> I've met several
[3:16:22] <+FusRoDom> maybe Pat?
[3:16:29] <DatAsuna> @FusRoDom gotcha
[3:16:31] <Picia000123> @Monkeyweed21 It all goes too quickly
[3:16:34] <SleepyMaribo> You need to go to the lab on this girl NOW Kampan is the highest damage dealer in the game.
[3:16:41] <+theAncopro> If Ajna throw up in your purse, you don't forgive her
[3:17:18] <+lethallunacyx> So no Vegetas in Woolie's life
[3:17:38] <Picia000123> The story in this game sucks donkey balls
[3:17:40] <+Cymen90> This game just does not take its own story seriously. The focus is clearly on the combat which most would not enjpy
[3:17:46] <Picia000123> We established that
[3:17:53] <DatAsuna> okay
[3:17:59] <DatAsuna> I've never seen the bully become good
[3:18:00] <DatAsuna> but
[3:18:08] <DatAsuna> I've totally had the bully start acting "Nice"
[3:18:10] <%SanguineQuest> The key to redemption is remorse. The characters in this game feel bad about the things they do. In real life a lot of people who say that are lying, in this game they are taken at face value.
[3:18:16] <DatAsuna> after you pass puberty and get hot lol
[3:18:32] <Monkeyweed21> Woolie if you immediately write someone off cause they were being shitty of course you're not gonna see them improve as a person
[3:18:33] <+Cymen90> @DatAsuna Humble-brag? :P
[3:18:41] <DatAsuna> maybe
[3:18:46] <jase__x> lol
[3:18:48] <@Solidus_113> Go into training mode with Kampan, she has some SETUPS
[3:18:48] <Picia000123> There is no room to grow in this game
[3:18:58] <Picia000123> No one gets character development
[3:19:01] <DatAsuna> but it's like "bitch, you didn't even burn that bridge, you burned the construction site of the bridge"
[3:19:01] <+theAncopro> buttons
[3:19:02] <SleepyMaribo> your attack pips
[3:19:04] <@Solidus_113> action points
[3:19:06] <Lelfro> If you write the off, you don't give them opportunities to change
[3:19:12] <Picia000123> Except DHAR
[3:19:14] <+theAncopro> so spend everything to get BIG
[3:19:15] <%SanguineQuest> The instinct when you're a jaded real-life person is to assume that remorse is a lie that is intended to open you up to further betrayal. Because this is a Saturday Morning Cartoon, it is in fact earnest.
[3:19:17] <jase__x> well there's dhar
[3:19:29] <+theAncopro> just go into training and see it
[3:19:30] <SleepyMaribo> Kampan is the HIGHEST damage dealer in the game hands down.
[3:19:31] <Picia000123> there's too many characters
[3:19:33] <jase__x> but dhar=bar AND WE NEED THAT BAR
[3:19:35] <+Cymen90> @DatAsuna Damn, I know people like that. More like burned my house and salted my fields, am I right?
[3:19:37] <@Solidus_113> One super that drains EVERYTHING
[3:19:41] <+shootbang_exe> kampan is one big hit
[3:19:51] <+ConLin_Arts_> Kampan was one of my mains after I got her
[3:19:55] <+ConLin_Arts_> She's so good!
[3:19:55] <@Solidus_113> Kampan is literally Big Number
[3:20:00] <+theAncopro> she is so dope
[3:20:04] <+ConLin_Arts_> and I love her, she's Oliver Fist
[3:20:16] <+Cymen90> Christ
[3:20:16] <SleepyMaribo> go to the lab, she is amazing
[3:20:16] <gridib> Spend all for BIG damage. Her normals are real flashy too. It's great
[3:20:19] <@Solidus_113> TRAINING
[3:20:25] <SleepyMaribo> TRAINING ROOM!
[3:20:34] <Yukai_Yami> Training rooooooom
[3:20:56] <+Cymen90> How can this game have such good art but such terrible framing of their scenes? Everything looks dead and empty.
[3:21:09] <Picia000123> she just gets a move
[3:21:10] <jase__x> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:21:14] <%SanguineQuest> RISING TACKLE
[3:21:16] <jase__x> Really
[3:21:16] <Picia000123> Amazing
[3:21:31] <+shootbang_exe> can you direct the up dash?
[3:21:38] <+shootbang_exe> I vaguely remember being able to but I forget
[3:21:40] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:21:58] <+ConLin_Arts_> Time for the fence man right?
[3:22:09] <+theAncopro> and you aint even done
[3:22:10] <@Solidus_113> yea
[3:22:16] <+ConLin_Arts_> I don't remember where he was really
[3:22:26] <@Solidus_113> BIG ASS DAMAGE
[3:22:33] <+theAncopro> hit that super and pop off
[3:22:39] <%SanguineQuest> Naga Rider owns
[3:22:51] <+Cymen90> The game should be WAY MORE zoomed in all the time. The outer worlds looks so bad to me
[3:22:54] <+ConLin_Arts_> I love how Naga Rider keeps posing
[3:23:21] <@Solidus_113> Poison and burn do in fact stack
[3:23:49] <Picia000123> That super is dope
[3:23:59] <Picia000123> Try Kampan
[3:24:25] <jase__x> punch girl

[3:24:40] <+ConLin_Arts_> only once
[3:24:43] <%SanguineQuest> PILE BUNKER
[3:24:44] <+theAncopro> it does not stack
[3:24:47] <@Solidus_113> you get one hit
[3:24:57] <+shootbang_exe> a loaded hit from kampan will break guards
[3:25:03] <Picia000123> she aint dhar no
[3:25:08] <Picia000123> :(
[3:25:23] <SleepyMaribo> do her special

[3:25:33] <Picia000123> yup
[3:25:36] <@Solidus_113> the explosion pops shields
[3:25:36] <gridib> Her special has some excellent sound design at the end. I hope you appreciate that one woolie.
[3:26:21] <%SanguineQuest> ORAORAORAORA
[3:26:24] <@Solidus_113> DAMAAAAAAGE
[3:26:25] <+ConLin_Arts_> sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye

[3:26:43] <+shootbang_exe> it'll break guard
[3:26:49] <+theAncopro> and once you get that last attack upgrade
[3:26:51] <SleepyMaribo> her loaded punch breaks guards
[3:26:58] <+ConLin_Arts_> sbfpSetIn

[3:27:27] <+ConLin_Arts_> She is great!
[3:27:42] <+theAncopro> and you can attack at the same time
[3:27:42] <SleepyMaribo> her loaded punch negates guard
[3:27:43] <@Solidus_113> the buster shell will also break guard
[3:27:46] <+theAncopro> with others
[3:28:27] <@Solidus_113> now image having that 5th action point slot
[3:28:44] <SleepyMaribo> 5th action point slot i think she does a little over 100k
[3:28:45] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:28:57] <gridib> Since you're using Naga rider you can do some kicks off of Kampan's super finisher It's very flashy

[3:32:16] <Picia000123> Thank you Plague very cool
[3:32:18] <Samuraiflame> LUL
[3:32:21] <DatAsuna> Tell us off the japanese self dick sucking games
[3:32:27] <+theAncopro> now he looks like a FOOL
[3:32:35] <+ConLin_Arts_> Plague "not a furry" Gripes
[3:32:48] <+mrcooperblack> I just tried to rewind the s tream
[3:33:01] <$StaceMcGate> How many hours has Plague devoted to anthropomorphic pokemon?
[3:33:14] <+ConLin_Arts_> at least 24h probably
[3:33:20] <+mrcooperblack> about as much as gamefreak
[3:33:21] <Louie_Salmon> Did you know that male anglerfish have their bodies absorbed by the female and just become a vestigial pair of testicles?
[3:33:29] <+ConLin_Arts_> yeh
[3:33:35] <+ConLin_Arts_> that is a strange but neat fact
[3:33:48] <alrobot2014> wait they just become the balls?
[3:33:54] <+ConLin_Arts_> yeh
[3:33:56] <$StaceMcGate> I missed it, is Naga Rider Woolie's favorite?
[3:34:07] <Louie_Salmon> Of course he is
[3:34:32] <+ConLin_Arts_> I'm not sure if they turn into the "lantern" or if it is a separate thing
[3:34:43] <Yukai_Yami> Don’t kink shame bro
[3:34:50] <Picia000123> finally
[3:34:53] <+ConLin_Arts_> LUL
[3:35:03] <Picia000123> just dogpile on them
[3:35:12] <@Solidus_113> nice
[3:35:52] <Picia000123> Woolie forgot
[3:35:52] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1204820081542402050?s=19
[3:36:09] <Yukai_Yami> Why do you keep forgetting Woolie
[3:36:36] <Picia000123> Please shut up Kampan
[3:36:36] <oAznoUta> we need to pair Ren with Leilani
[3:37:07] <Picia000123> What a good metroidvania
[3:37:18] <Iggeh0> feels like this game is videogame equivalent of RWBY
[3:37:28] <Iggeh0> characters look cool and then they talk
[3:37:43] <Picia000123> @Iggeh0 you're correct
[3:37:44] <%SanguineQuest> That's like, almost every anime
[3:37:45] <oAznoUta> Ren, Leilani, and Tungar. Team Number-Go-Up
[3:37:50] <+ConLin_Arts_> I really like the voice acting in this game
[3:38:01] <@Solidus_113> you need to do that for a secret area at the end of the game
[3:38:07] <Picia000123> the voice acting is pretty good until it isn't
[3:38:19] <$StaceMcGate> jesus these enemies are damage sponges
[3:38:21] <Picia000123> Like Ajna breaking her accent
[3:38:47] <$StaceMcGate> Did they ever patch the soldiers who did 24k damage a hit in Naga Rider's city?
[3:38:49] <@Solidus_113> Kampan should always have a shell loaded, it's so good
[3:39:00] <Picia000123> She should start with it yeah
[3:39:11] <Picia000123> Like oiled up Hakan
[3:39:27] <Picia000123> only way less cooler
[3:39:57] <Yukai_Yami> !uptime
[3:39:58] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 39 minutes
[3:40:12] <+theAncopro> haha ha

[3:40:59] <@Solidus_113> yeah
[3:41:01] <DeebzNutz100> @woolieversus I sent you a video of some Phoebe combos on twitter a while back. also showcases good usage of razmy super.
[3:41:11] <+theAncopro> you won!
[3:41:17] <jase__x> why even fight
[3:41:23] <karl_rex> Thats busted
[3:41:32] <oAznoUta> I guess we Earthbound now
[3:41:36] <+theAncopro> overworld combos lol
[3:41:39] <jase__x> this is so busted
[3:41:43] <Manwad> Overworld wombos PogChamp
[3:41:52] <Picia000123> That's busted
[3:41:58] <Sheepeze> Combo MADden
[3:42:06] <adamisfruit> Rising tackle
[3:42:12] <jase__x> just took 20 hours
[3:42:20] <Ramuzai> wait till it becomes celeste...
[3:42:28] <MassConnect> it's like they tried to make it accessible to non fighting game players by taking the fighting game out
[3:42:36] <korth367> dhar had his first drink there BibleThump BibleThump
[3:42:49] <Yukai_Yami> And his last drink.
[3:42:52] <+theAncopro> first and last
[3:42:53] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:42:54] <adamisfruit> Dhar sniffed his first alcohol
[3:42:57] <Picia000123> I am glad you enjoy it Woolie
[3:43:09] <$StaceMcGate> Did Woolie ever mourn Dhar?
[3:43:16] <jase__x> fuck no
[3:43:24] <Picia000123> Woolie got 6 arms
[3:43:32] <$Ralfclogs> jphYusuke
[3:43:32] <Picia000123> it was equivalent exchange
[3:43:33] <adamisfruit> Dhar, the best written character
[3:43:36] <@Solidus_113> also Ren colours
[3:43:44] <jase__x> woolie got that bar and forgot about Dhar
[3:44:01] <+shootbang_exe> bar > dhar
[3:44:08] <$StaceMcGate> Dhar was like his main DPS for the majority of the game
[3:44:13] <jase__x> kill the rest of the cast for bar and woolie will be happy
[3:44:26] <Picia000123> the cast honestly deserves it
[3:44:40] <Picia000123> Like, who the fuck is half of these people?
[3:44:47] <+theAncopro> get's 24 bars
[3:45:00] <@Solidus_113> If you got the game on PC, there's some really nice Half Life 2 and Portal colours
[3:45:02] <jase__x> kill ajna for 25 bar
[3:45:07] <Picia000123> Remember pistol guy?
[3:45:12] <Picia000123> The leg lady?
[3:45:16] <Picia000123> Who?
[3:45:38] <%redrins> you mean the combo beast and leg mommy? yes I do
[3:45:42] <HoIyShadows> five time indeed
[3:45:44] <korth367> when was the last time tiny sword turban hat guy said anything
[3:45:46] <@Solidus_113> My endgame was Latigo, Kampan, and Zahra
[3:45:57] <Picia000123> he said one thing and then nothing
[3:46:11] <$StaceMcGate> Turban guy only spoke one thing in the game and that was to announce his sidequest
[3:46:18] <gunsrlove> gotta fill out those party slots
[3:46:33] <jase__x> hate
[3:46:50] <jase__x> hate having forgettable party members
[3:47:36] <@Solidus_113> Ajna for Skullgirls 2
[3:47:46] <oAznoUta> was kind of expecting one of what's her face's colors to be Lucca
[3:47:59] <%redrins> would rather have dhar instead
[3:48:12] <+theAncopro> honestly reuse most of these characters in a fighting game
[3:48:19] <Picia000123> anything but Ajna god
[3:48:37] <adamisfruit> No more “quake with fear”, only quake with tears 😭
[3:48:43] <$StaceMcGate> Ajna is chat's currently most hated character?
[3:48:54] <adamisfruit> Yeah
[3:49:01] <Picia000123> She is the worst character I've ever played
[3:49:07] <jase__x> she's not good
[3:49:10] <Picia000123> That's saying something
[3:49:39] <karl_rex> My bet is the lady's dad became the slime
[3:49:47] <%mayorrev> awwww!
[3:49:48] <$StaceMcGate> I'd say my most hated main character was Rush from Last Remnant
[3:49:56] <%mayorrev> huggy boi
[3:49:57] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:50:26] <Picia000123> I mean, I had some bads, white bread with butter, but this THIS
[3:50:42] <HoIyShadows> ok gonna be finishing yardwork, stay hype doodz
[3:50:50] <Picia000123> I would rather have Link with no voice
[3:50:50] <+gustavozxd> why is she bad? Asking cause I barely seen anything on this game
[3:51:13] <+theAncopro> My prob is she goes from being sassy, to an asshole, to a mary sue
[3:51:28] <$Ralfclogs> She's not that bad you nerds
[3:51:32] <$StaceMcGate> @gustavozxd Hyperactive character that doesn't think things through, ignore's advice, and overconfident. She is currently in her redemption arc at this point in the game
[3:51:33] <Picia000123> She is a shonen protagonist, but not nice, a dumbass and the writing doesn't help
[3:51:33] <adamisfruit> She’s naruto levels of “the world bends to her stubbornness”
[3:51:52] <+theAncopro> she fine tho and the end wrapped up nice enough
[3:52:02] <Picia000123> The end was eehh
[3:52:05] <@Solidus_113> ONE MORE
[3:52:17] <Picia000123> but it could be way worse
[3:52:45] <Picia000123> There were characters I hated more that I didn't play
[3:52:54] <Picia000123> just existed in a story
[3:53:03] <@Solidus_113> just go left
[3:53:23] <$Ralfclogs> Go left omg
[3:53:45] <$Ralfclogs> Yay
[3:54:02] <$StaceMcGate> Baohzi was my favorite from trailers, but very boring to play as. I like Thorani, but her healing was sporadic and so many enemies absorb magic
[3:54:07] <Picia000123> almost there
[3:54:19] <karl_rex> SLIME QUEEN
[3:54:24] <+theAncopro> HeLLO
[3:54:25] <@Solidus_113> Kreygasm
[3:54:30] <Picia000123> I read that doujin
[3:54:35] <Ramuzai> Kreygasm
[3:54:35] <$StaceMcGate> straight up monster girl
[3:54:35] <Iggeh0> "are you alright?"
[3:54:37] <Lelfro> That's why Plague was here
[3:54:38] <%SanguineQuest> No wonder Plague was down here
[3:54:41] <+Prevot> YEYEYEYE
[3:54:41] <%SanguineQuest> jinx
[3:54:47] <@Solidus_113> Slime tiddies
[3:54:48] <karl_rex> YEYEYEYEYE THIS is IT
[3:54:48] <Grahfvitnir> Is this why Plague was in the Iron Kingdom?
[3:55:12] <Sheepeze> SeriousSloth YEYEYEYEYE
[3:55:14] <Louie_Salmon> God the BOOTY
[3:55:27] <+ConLin_Arts_> a BIIIIG Caboose
[3:55:28] <Louie_Salmon> Her slime ass is like half of her entire body
[3:55:30] <gridib> All physical attackers and no healer. Press F for woolie
[3:55:34] <Picia000123> No range huh
[3:55:43] <+theAncopro> you'llget a chance to switch
[3:56:02] <$StaceMcGate> As Pat would say, this is a DPS race
[3:56:10] <+ConLin_Arts_> WutFace
[3:56:18] <Yukai_Yami> SWITCH
[3:56:30] <@Solidus_113> Thorani has healing supers
[3:56:33] <Ramuzai> thorani
[3:56:33] <+Prevot> Googirls are shapeshifters by nature, that's why they're awesome
[3:56:36] <Yukai_Yami> HEALER
[3:56:43] <@Solidus_113> BUILD METER
[3:56:49] <adamisfruit> Goo girls are a solid monster girl
[3:56:54] <MassConnect> why hasn't plague been summoned to chat?
[3:57:00] <+theAncopro> Goku?
[3:57:00] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1204820081542402050?s=19
[3:57:02] <@Solidus_113> CATCH THESE HAAAAAAAAAANDSSSSS
[3:57:06] <$StaceMcGate> LUL
[3:57:08] <MassConnect> what are the magic plague words?
[3:57:10] <Picia000123> LMAO
[3:57:11] <%SanguineQuest> "Hit it even harder!" The Goku Solution
[3:57:11] <%redrins> she IS stupid
[3:57:24] <@Solidus_113> yeah it's dumb
[3:57:25] <oAznoUta> jesus. is there a level beyond deus ex machina? because that was it
[3:57:29] <korth367> ????????
[3:57:29] <+theAncopro> i actually rmember this being confusing
[3:57:30] <adamisfruit> The world continues to bend
[3:57:31] <+ConLin_Arts_> I never udnerstood how it worked
[3:57:43] <Picia000123> Am I watching Fairy Tail?
[3:57:49] <+gustavozxd> wait how did she just learn something new
[3:57:50] <Yukai_Yami> Ajna is such a Mary (Sue)
[3:57:50] <+ConLin_Arts_> LUL
[3:57:51] <Picia000123> Or seven deadly sins?
[3:57:52] <+theAncopro> SWITCH
[3:57:59] <korth367> that tutorial was fucking horrible
[3:58:02] <JacktheMan18> @gustavozxd she just did it
[3:58:02] <Iggeh0> Jesus she makes Naruto's power ups look subtle
[3:58:18] <Ramuzai> well she gets a lot DEUS ex machinas...
[3:58:25] <Louie_Salmon> Why can't they just say "Press Y with meter", why is that so difficult
[3:58:27] <karl_rex> At least she doesn't just turn even more orange
[3:58:53] <adamisfruit> Not... really
[3:59:47] <$StaceMcGate> I guess Woolie hasn't heard of Suu
[3:59:54] <+Vivaciousx3> its hitting all the right places Kreygasm
[4:00:11] <%redrins> she's a low tier slime girl
[4:00:20] <karl_rex> "Arrow" *kicks
[4:01:33] <+onlypuppet> She’s very pretty
[4:02:19] <Picia000123> the animation on the flip from sickles is funny LUL
[4:02:58] <+gustavozxd> Jesus Christ these sound effects
[4:03:06] <$StaceMcGate> all it has to say is "press triangle (with meter lvl 3)"
[4:03:14] <adamisfruit> She’s a decent slime girl
[4:03:22] <@Solidus_113> it doesn't even take 3 meter
[4:03:25] <@Solidus_113> it's just mash triangle
[4:03:45] <Picia000123> YAY
[4:03:49] <Picia000123> go Woolie
[4:03:51] <+theAncopro> you saved her!
[4:03:57] <+theAncopro> she saved!
[4:04:04] <Louie_Salmon> Strong voice clips
[4:04:05] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:04:09] <Picia000123> don't question it
[4:04:14] <%SanguineQuest> Every time I hear somebody say "How did that happen?" I think "Yo, ho, ho, he took a bite of Gum Gum"
[4:04:28] <oAznoUta> King Calibur
[4:04:37] <%jepupu> Mary's such a Skullgirls design
[4:04:45] <JacktheMan18> Eurynomos looks like a Rick-Dom
[4:04:50] <+theAncopro> see she also just good alll along
[4:04:54] <Naho_Saenoki> @SanguineQuest You are super not alone.
[4:04:59] <karl_rex> Yeah but she still filled the city with slime
[4:05:01] <JacktheMan18> Or at least he reminds me of that design
[4:05:05] <@Solidus_113> The bad guy wasn't bad allllll along
[4:05:11] <+theAncopro> like Ajna!
[4:05:17] <$StaceMcGate> Sure she killed people, but she's sorry guys
[4:05:21] <Picia000123> it all comes back together
[4:05:27] <Picia000123> AREEEEES
[4:05:49] <karl_rex> You heard them TECH IS BAD
[4:05:52] <Ramuzai> YEAAAAAAAAAH YANGGANG!!!
[4:05:55] <adamisfruit> Every villain is a reflection of Ajna
[4:05:56] <Grahfvitnir> Friendship was the true power all alooooong!
[4:06:13] <adamisfruit> YIN GANG 2020
[4:06:24] <Graxe_> If you rely too much on machines, the people might develop Drone Syndrome
[4:06:25] <karl_rex> Hurt... YOU KILLED DHAR
[4:06:28] <+gustavozxd> talk no jutsu?
[4:06:35] <Graxe_> And they'll need likecin
[4:06:37] <Picia000123> hhhmmmm
[4:06:43] <Iggeh0> just use the plot to bend the world to your will
[4:06:49] <$StaceMcGate> See guys? Just give dictators a 2nd chance to redeem themselves!
[4:06:55] <%SanguineQuest> Ah consent of the governed!
[4:06:57] <%SanguineQuest> How novel
[4:06:58] <Picia000123> what about that brother though?
[4:07:20] <karl_rex> Yeah what about the brother?
[4:07:24] <Louie_Salmon> I'm not sure there's anything complex here
[4:07:26] <+gustavozxd> she's hot I'll forgive her
[4:07:33] <Picia000123> you right
[4:07:34] <+theAncopro> hmmm fair
[4:07:39] <%SanguineQuest> "I'll mop up slime, you save the world. They're BOTH important jobs! :D "
[4:07:44] <Louie_Salmon> Ajna no, get that robot in your brain!
[4:07:53] <Picia000123> NO FOR REAL THO
[4:07:54] <%redrins> cannoli time
[4:07:58] <gunsrlove> Yes, Woolie it was just a dumb shounen all aloing
[4:08:05] <@Solidus_113> YEAAAAAAA
[4:08:07] <mr_ESB> I think Woolie will ''love'' Kampan's Super
[4:08:07] <+theAncopro> LVL UP
[4:08:10] <Louie_Salmon> Perft
[4:08:12] <Picia000123> YEYEYEYE
[4:08:13] <Yukai_Yami> Just screw Qadira’s bro?
[4:08:23] <theredhairedtrainer> more like a slide of faith
[4:08:28] <@Solidus_113> Woolie hasn't activated the quests yet
[4:08:32] <@Solidus_113> some of them aren't up
[4:08:37] <$StaceMcGate> Qadira is forgotten forever, just like Freya
[4:08:44] <Picia000123> oh man
[4:08:45] <adamisfruit> Qadira’s bro is super dead
[4:08:48] <Picia000123> my bad
[4:08:57] <Yukai_Yami> Why you gotta hurt me reminding me of Freya like that
[4:09:37] <Picia000123> not really
[4:09:39] <@Solidus_113> 2.5 hours to Nalt
[4:09:48] <Picia000123> just bad writing
[4:09:58] <$StaceMcGate> But how has she changed?
[4:10:07] <+HawkGoggles2> Did woolie forget the main reason she's coming back to all of these places?
[4:10:18] <+theAncopro> yea
[4:10:37] <+theAncopro> she's like woopsie doodle live and learn tho
[4:10:42] <Picia000123> remember that 5 minute from village to ashes in the beginning?
[4:10:49] <Picia000123> this is what we work with
[4:10:50] <Grahfvitnir> @StaceMcGate she got some new powers. That totally counts.
[4:11:06] <adamisfruit> Dhar was dusted for this half measure
[4:11:06] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:11:33] <DatAsuna> Toxic positivity
[4:11:42] <+LTKonnor> Toxic Optimism
[4:11:42] <Plagasman> It’s all good in the hood, brah.
[4:11:59] <+HawkGoggles2> She's not saying anything is ok. She wants these people to take responsibility for their actions. No one has made up for anything, that's why she's going back in the first place to finish what she started.
[4:12:00] <Picia000123> it leaves a bad taste in your mouth
[4:12:12] <+LTKonnor> BE HUMBLE
[4:12:16] <%redrins> everybody just forgives her so easily, there's nobody to tell her how bad she fucked up straight to her face anymore
[4:12:16] <Picia000123> it should work but it doesn;t
[4:13:01] <+gustavozxd> so do any of the party members get cool character development? I'd be surprised considering there's so many
[4:13:08] <Picia000123> fuck no
[4:13:12] <Picia000123> Dhar only
[4:13:19] <Picia000123> The rest is paper thin
[4:13:22] <Graxe_> Probably a Chrono Cross situation where it's only the important few
[4:13:36] <Manwad> endless pastabilities
[4:13:37] <@Solidus_113> one more swing for Kampan
[4:13:50] <$StaceMcGate> Dhar was Karsh if were comparing this to Chrono Cross
[4:13:53] <%UrielCobalt> Kamen Rider, Zero, sweet
[4:14:20] <adamisfruit> Dhar is the best written character in this game, and he’s gone at the 50% mark
[4:14:48] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[4:15:29] <MassConnect> with great murder comes great disposability - Dhar probably
[4:16:11] <Picia000123> I love those bugged flips LUL
[4:16:17] <Picia000123> just spinning
[4:17:06] <adamisfruit> The entire time Dhar did what he was told was right. The instant he’s shown the truth about Ravannavar and his own actions, he immediately changes paths and is deeply remorseful
[4:17:13] <+theAncopro> Spin 2 Win!
[4:17:14] <$StaceMcGate> If you just want hits, go Leiliani
[4:18:19] <@Solidus_113> The AoE attacks do less damage than the single target ones
[4:18:19] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1204820081542402050?s=19
[4:18:19] <Louie_Salmon> That was pretty good for spending so little meter
[4:18:28] <Picia000123> Woolie, mash
[4:18:40] <%SanguineQuest> Spin to Win
[4:18:48] <Picia000123> The desire to do combo too strong I guess
[4:18:52] <+theAncopro> so much spin
[4:19:16] <Louie_Salmon> Mashing the same move usually makes it lead into itself, but mashing is not the fighting game way
[4:19:26] <%SanguineQuest> It's bloodbourne all over again
[4:19:30] <@Solidus_113> You're supposed to press the attack button again and a direction on Ajna's lvl 5
[4:19:36] <$StaceMcGate> Unfortunately mashing will lead to victory in this game
[4:19:47] <@Solidus_113> I think it costs your attack points
[4:19:49] <Monkeyweed21> you need action points for the follow ups
[4:19:52] <+onlypuppet> That fluffy dog is so cute
[4:19:54] <%redrins> cannoli next time
[4:20:11] <+theAncopro> one place left, then side quests!

[4:20:28] <Picia000123> I would just send everyone at the enemy at once, mash and win so idk :P

[4:20:49] <Louie_Salmon> Gonna be honest, this game has a LOT more than I thought it did.

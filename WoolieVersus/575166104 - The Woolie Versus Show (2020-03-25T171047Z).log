[0:22:38] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> You're a great commentator Lil V! Id love more LP's from you ^^
[0:22:39] <POUND_CAKE94> Yeah this has been great
[0:22:39] <+Don2323> Lightsaber whip exists too
[0:22:39] <%OldManJEWc> there's a light whip
[0:22:44] <Redblood801> Statement: I would not be caught dead in the embrace of a meatbag
[0:22:45] <BigManLugan> V you're doing a fantastic cohost job and this is one of your best LPs Woolie
[0:22:48] <%Garthunox> theres a lightsabre slingshot woolie
[0:22:49] <aretos1> the whip makes SOME sense thou
[0:22:50] <olaksi> No don't get scientific, it's star wars
[0:22:54] <%OldManJEWc> @don2323 ayyy
[0:23:01] <+mankeyfigh> No stop
[0:23:02] <MasterKoosh> Arrogant Boast: Oh masters, of course I'm the best girl
[0:23:03] <jorniev> travis touchdown has a giant club
[0:23:08] <grouchio> if there's a whip there's a waaaay
[0:23:13] <@SoushinSen> When there's a force, there is a way. Anything is possible.
[0:23:13] <maplemilllk> What's better? The Star or the War?
[0:23:14] <RayCSmooth> Just use the force
[0:23:19] <aretos1> Lightsaber gun
[0:23:20] <drefizz> why would use have a light morningstar, if that hits you when you swing it, you're done
[0:23:20] <%Scarnehu> magic space sword powered by crystals
[0:23:23] <orphancrippler_> I want a lightsaber shield
[0:23:33] <%sshen> @aretos1 lightsaber gun happened in rebels
[0:23:33] <+Don2323> you'd be surprised how many dumb light weapons are around
[0:23:41] <%Scarnehu> light Halberd
[0:23:42] <+MidnightBurst12> also those weapons rely on their mass to do damage
[0:23:45] <Mechazoic_Era> what about like the marauder's axe?
[0:23:45] <aretos1> jesus chirst
[0:23:50] <+Ashaea> Energy Sword best sword
[0:23:50] <anar_bael> yo what have I missed?
[0:23:51] <Redblood801> Cortosis though
[0:23:52] <custoadian> my favorite dumb EU lightsaber thing is the cyborg with lightsabers in his knees and elbows.
[0:23:55] <ralphfromdk> Unless you make it out of that lightsaber proof metal
[0:23:56] <+mankeyfigh> Energy shields work on lightsabers apparently
[0:24:00] <Maleicus> i thought it wasnt gonna happen this week but im glad i checked
[0:24:01] <+Don2323> javelin
[0:24:09] <Superdandy96> The science of Star Wars is maklunky
[0:24:17] <+libra_zero> There’s a lightsaber GUN somewhere in the old lore
[0:24:28] <orphancrippler_> lightsaber crowbar
[0:24:35] <drefizz> what about hard light constructs Woolie
[0:24:38] <@Commando_Joe> don't gungans have energy shields?
[0:24:38] <+mankeyfigh> Wtf does that even mean lightsaber gun
[0:24:40] <+galagoth> Glaive is the coolest weapon
[0:24:43] <+wunp_fxs> i prefer that axe but ok
[0:24:44] <grouchio> Odachi best Nioh weapon
[0:24:45] <olaksi> spears for lyfe!
[0:24:45] <%Scarnehu> it's a bunch of musha-shaka-paka
[0:24:46] <thesickestzak> LIGHTSABER NUNCHUCKS
[0:24:52] <%BallerSwagBro9k> GUNSWORDTRICKROYAL
[0:24:54] <mistersups> I wish Rey got a lightsaber spear type thing
[0:24:55] <trinityxlv> theres a light whip
[0:25:02] <%OldManJEWc> The almost naginata looking saber from SWTOR is pretty rad tho
[0:25:10] <grouchio> eazy breezy
[0:25:11] <%ECRead> bare fists in best Nioh weapon
[0:25:14] <@Commando_Joe> https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/databank_gunganpersonalenergyshield_01_169_78606583.jpeg?region=0%2C49%2C1560%2C780 Gungans totally have energy shields
[0:25:17] <+wunp_fxs> YES WATCH IT
[0:25:24] <+Don2323> if you make the shaft of the light spear out of phrik or beskar you'd have a pretty effective weapon against other lightsabers....
[0:25:26] <StarlitStunner> Easy Breezy
[0:25:29] <Superdandy96> Laser sword is the simplest. But what about Laser Lances?!?
[0:25:40] <%Quiet__Viking> eizouken is the best
[0:25:45] <%Scarnehu> it's almost as good as beastars
[0:25:45] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Crybaby made me cry like a baby 10/10
[0:25:48] <+mankeyfigh> I’m not in love with Easy Breezy
[0:25:49] <ralphfromdk> Best lightsaber design is from the The old Republic trailer with the mom and her extendo handle, where her standard saber could turn into a pike, boom, 1 meter extra reach like that
[0:25:54] <Jaku2011> Fuck all that Dorohedoro is the best thing this season
[0:25:54] <am_omega> Devilman Crybaby was as usual for Devilman. Looked cool though.
[0:25:59] <jorniev> lightsaber greatsword?
[0:26:04] <arsonistdaria> easy breezy
[0:26:08] <ZeeJiggle> That EXISTS
[0:26:09] <Sapphire_Breeze> yes

[0:26:11] <Redblood801> That's a thing
[0:26:11] <grouchio> Dorohedoro watch it
[0:26:12] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PUNCH JEDI
[0:26:13] <Chatterbox1991> @woolieversus what about a light saber whip
[0:26:13] <+kaiju7544> I’ve always wanted to see a dual wielding short blade user. Specializing in close combat
[0:26:16] <%Scarnehu> yeah
[0:26:17] <Squeethemog> Mad Max light saber armor would look so cool!
[0:26:18] <sendart> warhammer power weapons
[0:26:18] <+MidnightBurst12> that is a thing
[0:26:19] <mistersups> Thats actually a thing
[0:26:19] <%TheOneCalledRock> doesn't a lightsaber dagger exist?
[0:26:21] <Zebroneath> That's super dumb, and I love it
[0:26:21] <am_omega> When Devilman Lady?
[0:26:23] <randominternetsurfer> Hey Little V, when are you gonna cover MGR "The Only Thing I Know"
[0:26:27] <%TheOneCalledRock> make a variant of that
[0:26:28] <Matermind0> Lightsaber knees
[0:26:29] <ZeeJiggle> Someone link the thing.
[0:26:30] <SaturnianOcean> I think that's a thing already, and it looks really dumb
[0:26:30] <grouchio> So does Dorohedoro
[0:26:31] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Penance Armor with Lightsabers LUL
[0:26:34] <orphancrippler_> lightsaber wolverine claws
[0:26:34] <ZeeJiggle> cuz i dunno what its called
[0:26:35] <%Scarnehu> woolieFUN woolieFUN woolieFUN
[0:26:37] <+kaiju7544> Think John wick but with short sabers
[0:26:39] <%OldManJEWc> Well, wouldn't it just be like the vibroblades but for gauntlets?
[0:26:49] <SaturnianOcean> Or was a thing in legends, I should say
[0:26:55] <TigerClaws12> monkaS
[0:26:56] <+Takreth> monkaS
[0:26:57] <olaksi> i think all light-weapons would almost certainly end up maiming their users

[0:27:20] <trickquestionz> That exists in Legends, the Emperor grew a mentally defective clone in a lab and stuck him in a lightsaber suit.
[0:27:21] <+Don2323> we need more discussion of phrik and beskar armor lol

[1:05:53] <SaturnianOcean> Wow
[1:05:53] <Gruhunchously> Everyone in this game is all about the stance.
[1:06:02] <Gruhunchously> Also, racist much?
[1:06:11] <+Bluemanzee> Pretty well spoken for a Rodian Kappa
[1:06:16] <%mitchteck> Talked to the wrong one
[1:06:22] <gruulmagebeast> so this guy has a human fetish?
[1:06:29] <Gruhunchously> Gal
[1:06:29] <Kirlrik> just like real aliens
[1:06:31] <siamzero94> gal

[1:06:35] <trickquestionz> Human fetish...
[1:06:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> She wants that human D LUL
[1:06:41] <trickquestionz> ResidentSleeper
[1:07:06] <Gruhunchously> Now how did she get her hands on lightsaber crystals?
[1:07:08] <+Bluemanzee> Human fetish is perfectly exotic if you're a lizard frog person
[1:07:09] <trickquestionz> The Plague of Rodia
[1:07:33] <+SolidusRex> Fun fact: she is into humans, sexually
[1:07:40] <gruulmagebeast> if woolie is a jedi sentinel then does that he mean he can point and send out smaller jedi Kappa
[1:07:41] <Superdandy96> @bluemanzee can’t argue with that logic
[1:07:52] <Gruhunchously> Two weeks later and they're still falling
[1:07:52] <trickquestionz> The Paige of Rodia
[1:07:53] <Amardeux> they're still falling for hours right?
[1:07:59] <asurite_warrior> You guys handling the quarantine well\
[1:08:04] <Gruhunchously> Granny pitches in

[1:09:58] <randominternetsurfer> we going Persona 5 here?
[1:10:07] <Jaku2011> The force is bullshit
[1:10:12] <Heyestus> the force is all around us, Luke. It is in all living things and binds us all together
[1:10:48] <Gruhunchously> There's probably someone in the EU who could pull off that shit.
[1:10:49] <derap41> That's kinda dumb
[1:10:50] <gruulmagebeast> manipulating the life force of an entire planet is PURE PAZAAK
[1:10:53] <MyNameIsRasus> Not this crude matter
[1:10:58] <trickquestionz> I mean Vader was able to figure out Luke had a sister off of nothing.
[1:11:17] <%Theycallmenerf> I gotta go to work now, hopefully every customer coming in remembers for cover their damn mouthes when they cough or sneeze. Wish me luck!

[1:14:37] <Gruhunchously> Kreia is basically 'you makes some good points but you're still an asshole'.

[1:17:44] <%fallenangelzelos> Their deaths merely become a lesson to another...yeah, pretty twisted
[1:17:51] <asurite_warrior> What do you guys like as a verses argument in game. examples like good vs evil, individualism vs collectivism, or Religion or atheism
[1:17:56] <+mczarklesby> What.... someone on a gaming stream who actually READ nietzsche and isn’t getting him third hand from a ken Levine game ?!
[1:17:58] <therealtacopancakes> he was a cuck kinda actually with salome

[1:18:06] <+ThaSparren> No Gods or Kings just the force
[1:18:12] <Gruhunchously> Sometimes your sole purpose in life is to serve as a warning to someone else.
[1:18:20] <mr_slaide> No gods or kings... Just Elmo.
[1:18:21] <+Hinasil> Nietzsche is a freaking mastermind but were he alive today, nobody would want to talk to him because he was extremely weird
[1:18:30] <derap41> Friedrich Nietzsche is one of the worlds most misunderstood authors
[1:18:30] <depressedpepega> Oops, but yeah, he died of syphilis, he had lovers.
[1:18:43] <specracer29> there a very good YouTube vid that goes deep in Keira's philosophy and how it relates to Nietzsche and the slave morality

[1:20:24] <asurite_warrior> Woolie is gonna choose Pazaak over the sisters
[1:20:28] <am_omega> I dunno is Kreia going to tell us to keep the PAKage in check?
[1:20:36] <NaturalGear> she's too preachy imho
[1:20:48] <SaturnianOcean> It is such a quiet thing to fall
[1:21:00] <Jaku2011> Ok Granny
[1:21:04] <+TheFabledAble> @WoolieVersus we know that canonically you gain lightside points for defense, sacrifice, and passiveness, and darkside for strong emotions, passionsand evil debocherous acts. Kreia despises acting hard light or hard dark without an understanding of nuance, because for her acting without critical thought makes you a slave
[1:21:07] <randominternetsurfer> @naturalgear she's your mentor. she needs to tell you shit cause you're both connected.
[1:21:07] <Deadbulky> Granny

[1:21:33] <Gruhunchously> I love Kreia because, her philosophy makes sense, maybe not in a universal sense, but to her and who she has been and what's happened to her.
[1:21:43] <Chisas_Dead_Body> Po g
[1:22:02] <%LiquidDinosaur> Kreia is rad because she isnt Evil she's just evil.
[1:22:04] <+ZestyArsenic> looks fine
[1:22:06] <%LiquidDinosaur> Lowercase evil.
[1:22:14] <astrofalcon1> Punch girl PogChamp
[1:22:17] <%xcompleasedad> REAL good
[1:22:22] <Gruhunchously> Every belief that she has, you can trace back to some event in her life and kind of understand how she got that way.
[1:22:26] <+ThaSparren> Yea there is a logic to Kreias ideas its just up to whether you agree or disagree with it
[1:22:35] <Superdandy96> Oh Jesus handmaiden, we’re in public
[1:22:37] <+Superspider51> chat did I miss anything good?
[1:22:44] <randominternetsurfer> fucking level her up. it's boring if you stay with the same 2 partners.

[1:23:28] <%OldManJEWc> Beo-Dor and the punch boys is a great band name
[1:23:31] <%LiquidDinosaur> (and it makes too much sense)
[1:23:45] <Heyestus> It makes you harder to resist, not better at saving.
[1:23:49] <Gruhunchously> @LiquidDinosaur It's a good theory with a lot of evidence to back it up, but I could go either way.
[1:23:57] <time_axis> putting things in brackets doesn't make woolie not see it
[1:24:08] <TDAWS_MP132> ? LUL ?

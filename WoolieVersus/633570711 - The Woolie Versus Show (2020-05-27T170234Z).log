[0:10:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> That is the worst

[0:10:56] <%correctedsun117> Like false validation

[0:12:44] <muniea3> homestuck suck (probably, I haven't read it)
[0:12:49] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Never watched it, don't know what it is. Is it a cartoon?
[0:12:50] <%GeneralSCPatton> I have no strong feelings one way or the other!
[0:12:51] <%afronooch> Homestuck is okay.

[0:15:08] <@Menitta> the Woolie Versus fanbase ruined Woolie for me.
[0:15:08] <+ggbhtg> Toxic _____ Community, which is EVERY community sooner or later
[0:15:11] <SereneFox> Yeah, like I enjoyed Kingdom Hearts 3, but seeing SO MANY people whine and complain about it made me stop and think "Wait, did I really enjoy the game?" same thing with Pokemon Sword and Shield
[0:15:22] <Doodle_Taco> Hey everyone KonCha
[0:15:22] <muniea3> fanbases are emblematic of the content, though

[0:16:59] <+ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus Woolie, speaking of Eminem, people use the term Stan in unironic fashion. We've fallen that far.
[0:17:00] <%DashXero> Sometimes, things are objectively bad, though.
[0:17:02] <muniea3> Music is the most emotionally invested in by nature
[0:17:10] <%Chatterbox1991> "Crucify Him" said Cleveland about Lebron
[0:17:17] <+doc_ock_rokc> There are some rap songs I LOVE but I'm not a fan of rap
[0:17:18] <+ChronoaZ> Viper is good
[0:17:22] <%Camail> we just like using the words good and bad waaaay too much
[0:17:24] <%andrex2311> just say "Fuck off asshole" to toxic fan and ignore them. SeemsGood

[0:19:04] <rexverminus> @huskarl_zap way to miss the point. reviewers exist to determine their own opinion of things and you read their review to gauge what your own might be
[0:19:05] <Hopit> I find your dislike of the word toxic, toxic Kappa
[0:19:09] <%krispen_wa> Toxic is a REALLY STRONG pokemon attack
[0:19:15] <%Irridium> you know when you get the Toxic ailment in Dark Souls? it feels like that but in real life
[0:19:17] <+oda_flobunaga> Mac Vs PC
[0:19:18] <%Camail> anti-social behaviors
[0:19:21] <%Ashenik1> The thing you like and I dont is objectively bad, plus your white
[0:19:23] <%eyezehuhh> everything is cringe. like what you like
[0:19:24] <%OldManDeckardCain> toxic is pretty overused nowadays tbf
[0:19:28] <Mayachacha> Toxic was a Britney Spears song
[0:19:37] <+doc_ock_rokc> Overwatch people that want to ban you for using a skin they don't like
[0:19:46] <stayinthepocket> Of course also the people that want to throw around "you're being toxic" when something is really just a valid criticism.
[0:19:50] <+ggbhtg> but don't be a dick about the things you don't like
[0:19:53] <%GoldeNOVA> cringe toxic Kappa
[0:19:54] <%eyezehuhh> @doc_ock_rokc is that a thing? that's incredible
[0:19:58] <the__empire_strikes__ass> Vous êtes très talentueux, tout ce que vous faites est génial melparTy Grand succès! SeemsGood Boi-oi-oing!
[0:20:05] <%andrex2311> Toxic is the best Pokemon move tbh
[0:20:08] <%Camail> toxic is a meme as well as a useful word, depending on who you talk to
[0:20:09] <%Chatterbox1991> Was the P5 Fandum really that bad?
[0:20:16] <+oda_flobunaga> @WoolieVersus but what if it ends up being terrible ?
[0:20:20] <@Menitta> Toxic is a real good pokemon move.
[0:20:22] <Doodle_Taco> @chatterbox1991 It has its parts
[0:20:23] <%barkon345> barkon345 subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 18 months, currently on a 18 month streak! 
[0:20:26] <+Ancopro> i don't care the ultimate power move
[0:20:32] <muniea3> just use icky pooie, it's more classic
[0:20:32] <+doc_ock_rokc> @eyezehuhh before the entire hong kong thing I was using the police skin and some asshats told me to remove it or they'll report me
[0:20:46] <%jiggy_snipe> was it Reggie?
[0:20:54] <%Chatterbox1991> Really? Woolie likes Jojo?
[0:20:58] <%Chatterbox1991> i hadnt noticed
[0:21:00] <+doc_ock_rokc> @eyezehuhh I screenshot the interaction and sent it in and thankfully i didn't get into trouble
[0:21:17] <+ggbhtg> Sounds like FGC ers
[0:21:18] <%Lion_kun> Part 1
[0:21:19] <%Ashenik1> witcher 3 kappa
[0:21:20] <@Menitta> That doesn't work
[0:21:22] <+ggbhtg> that I know
[0:21:23] <%jiggy_snipe> that is interesting
[0:21:24] <+treynrek> what are they talkin about
[0:21:25] <lotharrio> I don't understand that.
[0:21:25] <+wunp_fxs> weird
[0:21:26] <megamirk> nice legs, sith lord
[0:21:32] <+Ancopro> i think thats fair, i dont think you NEED to start at part 1
[0:21:40] <%mitchteck> Yyyyyyyyyyyy
[0:21:41] <%andrex2311> start with chapter 1, page 1
[0:21:47] <+Feralspirit41> I have become sheeple
[0:21:54] <%Lion_kun> Bandwagon jumping
[0:21:55] <%jiggy_snipe> Sheeple Kappa
[0:21:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> That's OOF, but to be fair I saw the All Might Vs Noumu fight without context to lure me in.
[0:22:00] <ralphfromdk> Those people are called followers :D
[0:22:00] <stayinthepocket> "Hey where start with thing?" The beginning is usually a good place to start.
[0:22:01] <%andrex2311> LUL
[0:22:06] <lotharrio> Cultivated consumption?
[0:22:08] <%barkon345> the issue is becasue of how long anime can get
[0:22:11] <%Camail> that's not entirely what this person is doing tho, they ultimately decide if they like it and continue watching
[0:22:21] <%jiggy_snipe> reverse hipster
[0:22:22] <$Invlux> performative enjoyment
[0:22:24] <Doodle_Taco> I want to be "based"
[0:22:29] <lotharrio> I can get that for One Piece. Cause that's how I got my friends to like it.
[0:22:29] <%Irridium> looking for validation
[0:22:29] <+ggbhtg> Will I fall out of my clique for liking this thing?
[0:22:39] <%andrex2311> so Game of Thrones?
[0:22:40] <%krispen_wa> SECONDARIES
[0:22:49] <+gandalfsmagicgaydick> gandalfsmagicgaydick subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:22:53] <%gatorafan> I've started watching Sajam's streams? What did I think about it? daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:22:54] <@Menitta> Solving that problem with FOMO is more rewarding than liking the thing
[0:23:02] <%spacehouse> I just like not wasting my time with awful media
[0:23:03] <@Menitta> In that case
[0:23:04] <stayinthepocket> The hell is fomo?
[0:23:05] <%barkon345> when you here about a cool part but realize you have to watch 300 episode to get to that part and find out the context of it, it might not seem worth it to watch the whole thing
[0:23:06] <Hopit> Anime was/is the biggest thing of that here, in my teenage years, if you openly said you watch anime, you were considered to be a freak and basically shunned
[0:23:10] <%Lion_kun> How many people only watched End Game?
[0:23:11] <%afronooch> Fear Of Missing Out
[0:23:12] <@Menitta> "Fear of Missing Out"
[0:23:21] <+ggbhtg> It aint a good look
[0:23:21] <stayinthepocket> ty ty
[0:23:25] <+Kyma1020> Sounds like a poser
[0:23:26] <%andrex2311> FOMO = Fear of Missing Out
[0:23:32] <%jiggy_snipe> sounds like a need for validation
[0:23:34] <@Menitta> Personally I've stopped taking recommendations.
[0:23:37] <Aydarkzero> sounds like that Key & Peele skit
[0:23:38] <%krispen_wa> There's also a "time optimization" part to it
[0:23:40] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Poser is right lol
[0:23:47] <$Invlux> very mature take from V
[0:23:48] <%Theycallmenerf> My nephew has Fomo right now, he’s only a year old but I hope he grows out of it.
[0:23:50] <%OldManDeckardCain> it used to be drugs and smoking, now it's shitty anime LUL
[0:23:50] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:23:52] <lotharrio> ...Alright so if there's a MASSIVE time commitment. Like 80+ hours, I can get saying, "What are the highlights?"
[0:23:54] <muniea3> I get it if it's in the context of someone who's busy and just want's to know what people are talking abou
[0:23:54] <%Ashenik1> @WoolieVersus I realy enyojed the ending of Game of Thrones, DMC 2 is the best in the franchise, Rise of the Skywalker is the most enjoyable thing that came out of Star Wars universe. How would you react?
[0:23:58] <+ggbhtg> High school clique mentality, that often DOESN'T end at high school
[0:24:04] <@Menitta> "I didn't get that memo"
[0:24:08] <+ggbhtg> Swag Yolo Fam
[0:24:10] <%Camail> no one ever liked moist
[0:24:14] <+ggbhtg> Both

[0:24:19] <+oda_flobunaga> Moist is a great word!
[0:24:23] <ghoulishcripple> I've never minded the term moist
[0:24:23] <+UberWolfman> College is just HS with money
[0:24:26] <%gandalfsmagicgaydick> College is just Super High School anyway
[0:24:26] <Psyramics> cliques exist at all levels of humanity. they dont end in high school

[0:33:20] <%Chatterbox1991> MrDestructoid500 Wooliem if you want to talk about weird and baffling religious practices endorsed Christianity, there one aspect to the Church of Latter Day Saints that i am shocked no one ever talks about; in addition to the traditions of Jesus Coming to America and other less printable beliefs, one of the more esoteric facets of the Mormon Church is there ability to, somehow, convert dead people to Mormonism, makes one wonder why they have evangelical ads on Youtube at all.
[0:33:21] <%Atomik456> well i mean

[0:36:13] <+Ancopro> magical girl but it's MEAN
[0:36:15] <%JohnAtDawn> Madoka is fine, but everything that followed after it being DARK is trash
[0:36:16] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Been 9 years, still holds up
[0:36:16] <rexverminus> Madoka is great when you're watching it and fucking trash when the movie jumps the shark.
[0:36:17] <%andrex2311> still can't get over the "secret tunnel" bit LUL
[0:36:20] <+Deano8817> is some good depressing shit
[0:36:24] <%Livelinne> Urobuchi good BibleThump
[0:36:29] <redrins> neon genesis madoka magica

[0:36:48] <%spacehouse> Rebellion is an Excellent end to the series, dont believe otherwise.
[0:36:55] <+GuilKato> its only 12 episodes so you can watch it like a long movie
[0:36:56] <%optimasmaximas> dragon prince is good
[0:37:00] <SiegeJay> Urobuchi only made one good anime, Fate//Zero
[0:37:01] <AvailableThor> BOOMER ANG?
[0:37:02] <%CozyGUNNA> it’s evangelion to magical girls
[0:37:05] <+Disgrea> Madoka is one of those quintisential anime that really did its own thing, but then a ton of series ripped it off and were drastically worse
[0:37:06] <+eanscrale> It's the scenario writer for avatar
[0:37:15] <+ggbhtg> Ok Boomerang
[0:37:15] <%Livelinne> YOU DONT LIKE MAGICAL GIRLS? WATCH MADOKA

[0:37:30] <%andrex2311> Madoka is really good, the cute designs are part of the subversion of expectations
[0:37:31] <+ZoltanBMagnus> dragon prince is still ongoing
[0:37:35] <vulkan_vibes> I rewatched atla just recently and the humor and timing is impeccable.
[0:37:46] <%optimasmaximas> theyre only like 10 episodes a season tho

[1:23:43] <AvailableThor> "HANDMAIDEN WILL REMEMBER THAT"
[1:23:43] <dinnydanny777> Wasn't Kyle Katarn a fallen Jedi at one point?
[1:23:45] <%gandalfsmagicgaydick> I mean, Luke & Leia are the descendant of a Sith too

[1:23:46] <LeBlanc233> The shawn bloodline LUL
[1:23:48] <SixthSun2> Nah, only personal connections are forbbiden, you can still fuck a whore
[1:23:49] <+jake5713> real talk
[1:23:50] <%Camail> at some point, someone failed the dick test
[1:23:54] <dinnydanny777> Fallen Jedi doesn't necessarily mean evil
[1:23:57] <%JohnAtDawn> I mean, there was SOME point where Jedi were allowed to fuck
[1:23:57] <%OldManDeckardCain> I want to become a priest, just like my daddy Kappa
[1:23:58] <StarlitStunner> Ki Adi Mundi fucks
[1:24:05] <+Feralspirit41> I bet carth was descended from a fallen jedi
[1:24:15] <DatAsuna> @dinnydanny777 yeah he went to the capital from swtor and it turned him to the dark side for one of the dakr forces expansions
[1:24:18] <GHouseduivel> Our blasters didn't work, and are blades were broken, it wasn't our fault
[1:24:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> @dinnydanny777 A jedi who decides to become a monarchial ruler though? Probably not a GOOD person.
[1:24:22] <ATPsoldat> PFFT.
[1:24:24] <+Hinasil> THE SITH TAINT
[1:24:26] <%JohnAtDawn> They weren;t always like 'no the pussy is tempting'

[1:24:30] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 24 minutes
[1:24:32] <blackskulldragon18> Evil jedi
[1:24:33] <%andrex2311> tainted by Nadds XD
[1:24:34] <DSD24> But its Freedun
[1:24:38] <+Feralspirit41> FREEDON NADDS DARK SIDE TAINT
[1:24:38] <%Atomik456> the sith grundle
[1:24:39] <Halospaz117> So what was that about him not necessarily being evil?
[1:24:39] <%Ashenik1> I can sense the Kreygasm
[1:24:46] <gerakiv> Chad fallen Jedi Monarch vs Virgin Jedi Knight
[1:25:16] <$legacy0117> Jedi aren't so wholesome apparently, or all this time fallen Jedi are like Anakin, results of extreme sexual frustrations.
[1:25:19] <blackskulldragon18> Training is disturbed
[1:25:20] <Deadbulky> Heavy metal starts
[1:25:20] <GHouseduivel> The David Cage gateway
[1:25:22] <DSD24> Argent Energy?
[1:25:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> To be fair, the Mandalorians are ALIVE, so maybe they're onto something.
[1:25:29] <+Stupid121v2> Darth Nadds
[1:25:32] <derap41> Darth Woolz?
[1:25:33] <penitentpentwitch> Don't Jedi 'technically' allow breeding as long as there are no emotions for the offspring?
[1:25:35] <akman14> Wrong lets play V
[1:25:35] <%gandalfsmagicgaydick> They're trying to open the Upside Down!
[1:25:36] <%Chatterbox1991> DARTH FREEDOM
[1:25:37] <brosephmike> Darth Go Nadds
[1:25:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> Darth Baul
[1:25:39] <%spiritofmojave> Darth Fritos
[1:25:45] <+Estuko> "Buth'ole"
[1:25:48] <%andrex2311> they are trying to make Doom 2016 happen
[1:25:50] <ATPsoldat> Skywalker is a pretty cool last name though
[1:25:52] <redrins> darth go'Nadds
[1:25:53] <Redblood801> Darth Sawcon
[1:25:54] <+oda_flobunaga> What was he born as, to choose the name Freedon Nadd
[1:25:55] <+Ascethetic> Darth Darlington
[1:25:57] <+doc_ock_rokc> Mad this rancid Nadds taint has poisoned this place
[1:25:58] <GHouseduivel> No guys I was really strong
[1:26:01] <+Feralspirit41> Darth Taint
[1:26:03] <+ItsRatman> Darthington
[1:26:03] <%krispen_wa> Marka Ragnos was sick as fuck and didn't have a Darth in his name tho
[1:26:05] <lotharrio> Had sex. Bad at his job.
[1:26:07] <DatAsuna> He was a sith though, he studied from naga sadow and killed him
[1:26:09] <Sedrelic> so...satan
[1:26:18] <%Atomik456> i mean if you go crazy and evil enough as a jedi that you just go right to murdering and ignoring history you'd skip the sithy and darth part
[1:26:28] <%krispen_wa> Actually when was the "Darth" title instituted? Because the ancient Sith Lords didn't have "Darth"
[1:26:32] <blackskulldragon18> Darth Narshida would sound cool
[1:26:33] <+jake5713> so wrong
[1:26:33] <JetpackMcQuack> Sith that are bad at they’re job die off pretty quick
[1:26:36] <+oda_flobunaga> Daerth Bred
[1:26:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Sith is just a title
[1:26:53] <Jayceerza> is this vanilla or TSLRCM?
[1:26:57] <gerakiv> The Great hyperspace wars were fucking crazy tho
[1:27:02] <GHouseduivel> @Jayceerza TSLRCM
[1:27:03] <%Atomik456> cant be a darth if you kill sith for shits and giggles
[1:27:04] <Halospaz117> The Genocide was just a bonus
[1:27:05] <JaceIsEpic> isnt nadd the dude who controlled stars?
[1:27:10] <Manjove> Genocide was just a bonus
[1:27:12] <dinnydanny777> If the Sith are evil is eradicating them good?
[1:27:13] <SiegeJay> Are you really a Sith if Mira kills you?
[1:27:15] <lotharrio> "From Freedon's perspective, Woolie is a stupid name!"
[1:27:23] <ralphfromdk> But hey, the king, he lived long enough to take over a planet and have offspring. Most jedi / sith just die never having done anything of worth ever.
[1:27:37] <+Feralspirit41> Basically the empires mentality "we genocided this group while doing this evil shit"
[1:27:37] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1265145307408539648
[1:27:39] <DSD24> Assuming direct control
[1:27:41] <Redblood801> @dinnydanny777 FROM MY POI-
[1:27:47] <ghoulishcripple> also has to be auto attack and not a skill
[1:27:49] <+oda_flobunaga> Palpatine Fucks
[1:28:04] <lotharrio> "Combat Enhancement Rapid Shot"
[1:28:07] <%Atomik456> yeah i feel like the implication here is he kinda just went right off and ignored the sith and just decided to be a evil force user on his oown terms
[1:28:15] <$legacy0117> Brb.
[1:28:18] <SiegeJay> Remember the old Gendy Clone War Cartoon when Dooku told Atris, "If you were Sith, this fight would be over already"
[1:28:25] <gerakiv> Rey is technically a princess, she just needs an empire to rule Kappa
[1:28:27] <The_Nerd_Supreme> oh the puzzles lmaooo
[1:28:44] <+Feralspirit41> Ive been waiting for the temple

[1:29:54] <megamirk> Exar-sama
[1:29:58] <gerakiv> Exar Senpai
[1:30:01] <dinnydanny777> I can't believe Exar Kun left his armour in like fifty different chests
[1:30:09] <dinnydanny777> What an idiot
[1:30:12] <AvailableThor> He had a lot of armors.
[1:30:15] <megamirk> he was a prankster
[1:30:20] <lotharrio> Something for Mira's gun?
[1:30:23] <megamirk> 100% business, all the time
[1:30:28] <audibleellipsis> what've i missed? where are we now?
[1:30:28] <dinnydanny777> Exar Kun is running around shirtless in the rain somewhere waiting for Woolie
[1:30:29] <SiegeJay> We done chat? With the Exar-kun jokes? We done?
[1:30:36] <%spiritofmojave> Never
[1:30:37] <GHouseduivel> He was all about the brand I almost bought one from the Galactic shopping network
[1:30:38] <%Ashenik1> Sith Temple
[1:30:41] <+thehotrefrigerator> @SiegeJay nope
[1:30:42] <megamirk> we were, but now that you've mentioned them
[1:30:49] <DSD24> You made them stronger
[1:30:52] <AvailableThor> He was kicked from the Jedi for his obessison with having multiple set of armor.
[1:30:55] <dinnydanny777> Exar Kun was shirtless in the rain somewhere all along
[1:30:59] <audibleellipsis> thanks @Ashenik1
[1:31:02] <%spiritofmojave> Push Exar-Senpai more
[1:31:02] <+thehotrefrigerator> @SiegeJay joke would have died but now it has been risen again
[1:31:03] <Redblood801> We will stomp this joke into the ground like we always do
[1:31:13] <megamirk> Jedi kicked him out because his name made them uncomfortable
[1:31:25] <+thehotrefrigerator> "S-sugoi Exar Kun-kun"
[1:31:28] <%Ashenik1> @Redblood801 whats the alternative then?
[1:31:36] <dinnydanny777> Exar Kun is running around shirtless in the rain on Kamino waiting for a boss fight to begin
[1:31:36] <SiegeJay> GOD FORBID Mira is liked
[1:31:40] <AvailableThor> His name was too cute and made the Jedi-council doki doki.
[1:31:42] <+doc_ock_rokc> Jolee should have meet kreia
[1:32:00] <+oda_flobunaga> Important question, is the only difference between grey jedi and sith that grey jedi are attractive?
[1:32:02] <dinnydanny777> Murder kill granny

[1:32:07] <+thehotrefrigerator> @AvailableThor My Sith Lord Can't Be This Cute
[1:32:16] <+cmdrmobium> The Sith are into basket weaving?
[1:32:18] <%Atomik456> im pretty sure they'd just try to murder each other on sight
[1:32:23] <%Atomik456> or they'd fuck
[1:32:26] <lotharrio> "Some sort of METAL MAN?!"
[1:32:31] <%Atomik456> i don't really want to see either
[1:32:34] <%Ashenik1> Jolee and Kreia my favourite example of 34 rule
[1:32:43] <dinnydanny777> If the force is powered by midichlorians is the force just blood magic
[1:32:55] <gerakiv> Kreia x Vrook (the dantooine jedi) otp
[1:32:56] <GHouseduivel> @dinnydanny777 Why would you say this?
[1:33:39] <+Estuko> hobbies
[1:33:46] <lotharrio> Rakatan wicker baskets!
[1:33:51] <+cmdrmobium> tower of hanoi time?
[1:33:51] <megamirk> super advanced technology - wicker baskets
[1:33:55] <dinnydanny777> Those wicker baskets are evil though
[1:33:56] <%spiritofmojave> Sith still believr in a e s t h e t i c
[1:34:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> They just went to the Pottery Barn don't judge them for wanting to be chique!
[1:34:03] <megamirk> Sith Ikea
[1:34:04] <+Feralspirit41> now is the time
[1:34:06] <GHouseduivel> Supporting our local Wookie economies is important
[1:34:06] <dinnydanny777> Those are dark side wicker baskets
[1:34:10] <gerakiv> PEMDAS
[1:34:13] <yukin0tora> oh this puzzle
[1:34:14] <Tomas2886Cz> The most sith-like power of them all, math.
[1:34:15] <Space_Pagan> Some Sith took up making wicker baskets as a hobby
[1:34:16] <lotharrio> Math! Math! Math! MATH!
[1:34:18] <jnaynnay> MATH
[1:34:21] <Redblood801> Whoever gets this right Graduates
[1:34:21] <+Estuko> After slaughtering a village of defenseless farmers you nver wanted to go back to finishing your wicker baskets with your pals?
[1:34:21] <+mczarklesby> Everyone loves baskets. Basket weaving leads to craft time. Craft time leads to photography, and photography leads to the dark room.

[1:34:47] <+griffball13> what is this dark sith magic
[1:34:52] <AvailableThor> This puzzle is tricky becasue it doesn't specify that you can one use each operator once.
[1:34:53] <+SolidusRex> Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Woolie
[1:34:53] <%Irridium> well, mission failed. back to base, we tried
[1:34:54] <Chisas_Dead_Body> Will balls be exposed?
[1:34:58] <dinnydanny777> This is truly evil
[1:34:59] <RunoEddie> @oda_flobunaga gray jedi are jedi that are willing to go outside the Jedi Council, not darkside users
[1:35:04] <dinnydanny777> Only a sith would use a maths puzzle
[1:35:08] <JetpackMcQuack> Sith math
[1:35:10] <Deadbulky> Woolie Vs math
[1:35:10] <RiverBirch> times, sub, add, div

[1:35:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh, I thought you could only use each operator once, this is far easier.
[1:35:34] <Shade075> Math is all about absolutes, of course sith would use it
[1:35:39] <lotharrio> 11!
[1:35:46] <+oda_flobunaga> @RunoEddie just like Kreia?
[1:35:46] <AvailableThor> 1+1=1

[1:36:20] <%JohnAtDawn> you've mentioned it before
[1:36:25] <GHouseduivel> Look at us, solving math, and shit
[1:36:25] <RunoEddie> @oda_flobunaga I would not call Kreia Jedi anything honestly, I have no clue what to call her
[1:36:26] <dinnydanny777> You should have got dark side points for solving the puzzle
[1:36:30] <T_Sasquatch> 55

[1:37:32] <+oda_flobunaga> @RunoEddie maybe she's a Jeth or a Sidi
[1:37:32] <DatAsuna> How long does it take to go 80 miles at 80MPH?
[1:37:38] <Redblood801> What is the title of Treasure Island?
[1:37:47] <JetpackMcQuack> My dad swears he got ripped off by McDonalds over a dvd player

[1:38:04] <Manjove> my twitch does not like this dungeon.
[1:38:30] <Chisas_Dead_Body> Mira weee
[1:38:35] <%Irridium> what's heavier? A kilogram of steel, or a kilogram of feathers. Right, steel. Because steel is heavier than feathers :)
[1:38:37] <Chisas_Dead_Body> !uptime
[1:38:37] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 38 minutes
[1:38:52] <+doc_ock_rokc> @Irridium but they both weight the same
[1:39:06] <dinnydanny777> Anyone remember those maths questions that are like "Jimmy has 250 apples"
[1:39:15] <Daxalog> How has Pocket's Force memory of jumping over the dunes of tatooine for the smallest whiff of credits not transferred?
[1:39:22] <RunoEddie> @oda_flobunaga Qui-Gon Jinn was considered a Grey Jedi by some Jedi, for example
[1:39:23] <%Irridium> @doc_ock_rokc but... steel is heavier than feathers
[1:39:37] <+doc_ock_rokc> but they are both a kilo
[1:39:46] <GHouseduivel> That was a war droid
[1:39:53] <+oda_flobunaga> @RunoEddie Quillan Vos too I think
[1:40:21] <dinnydanny777> I find that weird because neither of them really do anything dark sidey in the movies
[1:40:55] <dinnydanny777> I guess it's because of other stories?

[1:41:32] <dinnydanny777> The Sith are very serious about their diagnostic reports
[1:41:37] <Halospaz117> Oh fuck I remember this one
[1:41:38] <%alrobot2014> this one hurts me every single time
[1:41:42] <dinnydanny777> The Sith love maintaining systems

[1:41:56] <+oda_flobunaga> @RunoEddie I was originally making a joke about how, if you are evil but you are hot, it makes you morally grey
[1:42:04] <+ItsRatman> Ugh too much thinking. Can't we just puch the computer???
[1:42:21] <dinnydanny777> I thought the Sith were supposed to be like, destructive
[1:42:25] <Redblood801> Save first
[1:42:34] <lotharrio> Save then brute force.
[1:42:40] <j0ustar> where's a Titanfall 2 hackknife when you need it
[1:42:44] <%Irridium> save then look up a walkthrough
[1:42:54] <%GeneralSCPatton> Just pick whichever letter is in 4 of the things
[1:42:57] <megamirk> it's not that hard
[1:43:02] <+Feralspirit41> I didnt even bother actually figuring it out when i did it i just googled it
[1:43:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> We're learning how many people never even try with puzzles in games. LUL
[1:43:35] <dinnydanny777> Puzzles truly are the dark side of the force
[1:43:36] <Space_Pagan> we're inside Bao-dur
[1:43:38] <%Irridium> it's not that I don't try I'm just very dumb
[1:43:40] <+Feralspirit41> Im down for puzzles just not THIS kind of puzzle
[1:44:03] <+AjaxFoamingCleanser> I genuinely don't understand what this puzzle is asking for
[1:44:08] <%CozyGUNNA> puzzles FailFish
[1:44:20] <Deadbulky> reading hard
[1:44:25] <%spiritofmojave> sipsipHellmo puzzles sipsipHellmo
[1:44:32] <+Stupid121v2> Makes sense the dark side is math
[1:44:37] <SiegeJay> C is in 4
[1:44:42] <DatAsuna> I'd had job aplications that did stuff like this
[1:44:56] <abelincoln_catpuncher> baby is
[1:44:59] <dinnydanny777> If Jimmy has 5 apples and you take 3, how many would he have to buy to have 5 apples again?
[1:45:00] <abelincoln_catpuncher> baba is you
[1:45:07] <T_Sasquatch> BRUTE SMARTS
[1:45:07] <Redblood801> Force Try Again
[1:45:07] <lotharrio> Use the brute Force, Luke.
[1:45:09] <subjectg> this is a similar puzzle to those ones that ask who is lying
[1:45:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> What's the point of asking this on a job application? You can just Google it.
[1:45:18] <+Feralspirit41> Ya know i noticed something, theres two types of people; people who are super good at math and people who hate it with a passion
[1:45:19] <SiegeJay> BITE ZA dusto!
[1:45:27] <+jake5713> Morty, no!
[1:45:28] <+doc_ock_rokc> @dinnydanny777 None because Jimmy aint no bitch

[1:46:13] <dinnydanny777> If a train arrives at 7.15AM and 6 people get on, the same train arrives at 8.00AM and 2 people get off, then the same train arrives at the next stop and picks up 3 new passengers, how many passengers are now on the train?
[1:46:17] <DatAsuna> also a lot of grammar checkers

[1:46:50] <%GeneralSCPatton> @feralspirit41 Once you get super good at math, it basically becomes a form of True Sight. If you have it, you love it.
[1:46:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> If you're not in engineering/programming probably not.
[1:46:53] <audibleellipsis> @dinnydanny777 trick question, you never said how many people were on it in the first place
[1:46:55] <Redblood801> I wish Remote would play those sick beats
[1:46:55] <%Chatterbox1991> How many of us ran into that one Matg Puzzles in the Bank Vault in P5?
[1:46:55] <%Irridium> trains big and go woo woo
[1:46:57] <gerakiv> That would depend on how many passangers were on the train before 7:15am
[1:47:00] <muniea3> V lookin at the wave forms and getting off on it
[1:47:02] <%Chatterbox1991> And couldnt do it?
[1:47:03] <Doodle_Taco> @subjectg nice
[1:47:04] <JetpackMcQuack> Guitars are surprisingly math heavy
[1:47:07] <akman14> What about when the whole world turns into stone and you are awaken into a stone world?
[1:47:11] <DatAsuna> Math was the worst part of computer sicence for me
[1:47:16] <+cmdrmobium> You need math to get the big number
[1:47:16] <dinnydanny777> Really though screw those rambling maths questions where the question is more confusing than the actual maths is
[1:47:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> What the fuck is "Math 30 Pure?"
[1:47:19] <%ChoculaUltra> you guys don't have to find the hypotenuse in everyday life???
[1:47:20] <%Ashenik1> algebra Kreygasm
[1:47:20] <MattHughh> “We know our players are wondering what’s next for Street Fighter V, so we have some exciting news to share,” reads the developer blog. “Due to the positive reception to Season 4 and Champion Edition, we are planning to do a final Season ‘V,’ which will add ‘V’ more fighters to the roster. Three new stages are also being planned.”
[1:47:22] <DatAsuna> I actually was okay at LEARNING math but terrible at retaining it
[1:47:27] <cobalt_phoenix_> also hello to future me who will be watching this later
[1:47:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> Not what it is, but that name.
[1:47:36] <MattHughh> pretty hype
[1:47:42] <T_Sasquatch> As an engineering undergraduate fuck math until its time for math
[1:47:43] <treacherously_> He got to where math stops being fun for most
[1:48:00] <+Feralspirit41> Math stopped being fun at algebra
[1:48:12] <%CozyGUNNA> @feralspirit41 on god
[1:48:12] <SiegeJay> Is the V in LittleVMills is for Vectors? because math? PogChamps
[1:48:15] <+doc_ock_rokc> @MattHughh So are you saying we are getting V?
[1:48:20] <+Feralspirit41> Although most of that was cause my teacher didnt actually teach anything
[1:48:27] <T_Sasquatch> Math is only fun when you're getting it right
[1:48:30] <treacherously_> I entered uni engineering left neuro cus fuck physics too
[1:48:32] <DSD24> Crit Defensive Blade souds awesome
[1:48:33] <DatAsuna> gdi stream is lagging tf out
[1:48:34] <MattHughh> math stopped being fun at what we started not needing in everyday life
[1:48:34] <+Feralspirit41> she gave us worksheets and said "do this" without actually showing us how to do it
[1:48:43] <MattHughh> @doc_ock_rokc sounds like it rihgt?
[1:48:43] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:48:43] <%GeneralSCPatton> @feralspirit41 But that's when math starts to reveal the metaphysical truths of existence.
[1:48:48] <%Irridium> I'll be real I dropped right the fuck off math when we started talking about imaginary numbers
[1:48:48] <DSD24> That sounds terrible @Feralspirit41
[1:48:52] <SiegeJay> Math is fun when the methods make sense for you
[1:48:52] <treacherously_> Calculus is kinda fun if you have infinite time to practice it
[1:49:04] <JetpackMcQuack> Math gang gameattackWutang
[1:49:08] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @feralspirit41 you're literally describing my geometry teacher from high school lol
[1:49:10] <+Feralspirit41> @generalscpatton if i wanted to learn about the truth of existence id have gone into philosophy
[1:49:16] <T_Sasquatch> Ironically the level of math required for living a normal life is really surprisingly low
[1:49:18] <DSD24> Fractions is the real shit
[1:49:29] <Doodle_Taco> @feralspirit41 Why are most math teachers like this?
[1:49:30] <audibleellipsis> match stopped being fun at calculus, where things stop making sense and you just have to remember laws without any kinda obvious logic.
[1:49:32] <%CozyGUNNA> fractions fun
[1:49:37] <+grim_alex95> I never understood algebra because every teacher I had was unable to teach it atpFeelsBeardMan
[1:49:37] <sagemodeanon> Ive honestly never used math after highschool besides MDAS and rarely percentages
[1:49:44] <cobalt_phoenix_> math was always fun for me but since it never gets used irl i forgot most of it :(
[1:49:44] <treacherously_> Applied math stuff is good
[1:49:45] <DatAsuna> I liked trigonometry I just could never remember it
[1:49:52] <subjectg> ever considered how to apply integration by parts in normal living situations
[1:49:57] <treacherously_> I use a lot of graphs at work in lab
[1:49:58] <liriallirial> sup people
[1:50:02] <+Feralspirit41> ironically my best math is statistics
[1:50:06] <cobalt_phoenix_> socatoa
[1:50:08] <DSD24> Hiya! @liriallirial
[1:50:10] <dinnydanny777> Maths is fun to prove a point tho
[1:50:20] <JetpackMcQuack> Math makes you better at video games
[1:50:20] <+Feralspirit41> i was good at binomials
[1:50:28] <+MillerLowlife> math sucks eat my shorts
[1:50:29] <audibleellipsis> fuck proofs
[1:50:30] <%MattDemers> I gotta admire the dedication of V always wearing his robes
[1:50:31] <DSD24> I liked PEMDAS
[1:50:31] <+doc_ock_rokc> I got up to discreet mathmatics and then couldnt' get it
[1:50:36] <dinnydanny777> Can we get "force catch a star destroyer"?
[1:50:39] <Manjove> SUCH A BIG FORCE
[1:50:49] <megamirk> Mace Windu was untouchable too
[1:50:54] <DatAsuna> btw for vias, finese melee does affect sabers and her high dex makes it useful
[1:50:55] <megamirk> until he wasn't
[1:50:56] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @dinnydanny777 you can if youte starkiller lol
[1:51:03] <cobalt_phoenix_> do you guys think jedi were taught physics?
[1:51:27] <DSD24> People got so hype at that first trailer with Starkiller bringing down the destroyer
[1:51:31] <+doc_ock_rokc> @CobaltPhoenix27 some jedi repair hyperdrives I think they know more about physics then we do
[1:52:01] <+CezrDaPleazr> How you liking the game?
[1:52:06] <dinnydanny777> Wow
[1:52:13] <+doc_ock_rokc> @DSD24 It was pretty damn cool
[1:52:14] <DatAsuna> maybe turn the gameup to hard if you haven't lol
[1:52:15] <+Feralspirit41> you know if real math actually let me loot ancient evil tombs id be more inclined to do it
[1:52:17] <abelincoln_catpuncher> oof
[1:52:18] <cobalt_phoenix_> wait now that i think about it couldn't force users just crush people's brain with the force or something? that has to have been done at some point right?
[1:52:20] <Redblood801> Did we ever change the difficulty back to normal?

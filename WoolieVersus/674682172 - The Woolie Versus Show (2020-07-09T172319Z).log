[0:12:30] <%Exiliator> game / novel LUL
[0:12:35] <%Exiliator> so much text
[0:12:36] <+magiclottie> cause i am so excited for woolie to see how broken Vivian is
[0:12:37] <Drusain> What is the nature of a man
[0:12:39] <%generalve> chris he may be a sexual predator :(
[0:12:41] <oyunllama> @dmcRedgrave what is a man?
[0:12:44] <petwisk> Apahaty is Death
[0:12:45] <Prevot> ssshhhh
[0:12:47] <%jessyg920> I am not caught up to the anime, I feel like I'm going to be so lost today.
[0:12:57] <WG101> @oyunllama a miserable little pile of secrets
[0:13:04] <GenericSoda> @magiclottie no spoils man
[0:13:11] <%dmcRedgrave> It's really unfortunate to hear about Avellone.
[0:13:19] <%dmcRedgrave> But that's a depressing thought for another day.
[0:13:22] <Prevot> jesus, 16?!
[0:13:25] <jorniev> MONST OF THEM ARE LIES
[0:13:28] <GenericSoda> keep the future on the dl
[0:13:30] <%DatAsuna> And no matter how much more you tell him it will remain the only thing lol
[0:13:35] <%ringabal> Reminds me of Baldur's Gate 2
[0:13:46] <milhousego> so how far do ya'll think we'll get today?
[0:13:47] <%hawk_rush> LUL
[0:13:47] <andrex2311> LUL
[0:13:51] <+Euphbugg> LUL
[0:13:51] <%hawk_rush> get ready to get fired
[0:13:51] <Daniel_Is_I> LUL
[0:13:51] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[0:13:55] <Railgun5> Is it super quiet or is it just me?
[0:13:58] <+zooeymainbtw> LUL
[0:14:09] <Papa_Bearman> I heard that VPNs aren't nearly as secure as people think.
[0:14:09] <+Massimoman64> nice hoodie Woolie
[0:14:10] <jorniev> who is screamng WOOOOOO
[0:14:23] <twieetcha> @woolieversus so woolie how many more horrors do you think we’ll see in this game?
[0:14:24] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:14:25] <%hawk_rush> i hope whoever you are you don't get in trouble 🤞
[0:14:28] <Daniel_Is_I> If it's just rerouting then they WILL find out
[0:14:28] <%emperordread> As an IT nerd, it's shameful they even allow you to install your own software - so they probably won't notice the traffic either
[0:14:31] <%Exiliator> lord bless steam sales
[0:14:32] <@Commando_Joe> Woolie claims them on his taxes guys
[0:14:34] <@Commando_Joe> Don't ask him
[0:14:38] <@Commando_Joe> lol
[0:14:40] <HereComestheChief> The only RustleMania TOO BIG for one night!
[0:14:43] <+NickHatesSnow> buy on sale bb
[0:14:45] <+zooeymainbtw> @papa_bearman they are not, you need a whole bunch of stuff and the right vpn to be actually safe
[0:14:46] <Prevot> more expensive games will hurt anything that's not AAA
[0:14:51] <$BallerSwagBro9k> nice
[0:15:00] <%Invlux> oog
[0:15:03] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> VPNs help but need more tools to have total privacy. But if they're letting you install software on work computers then fuck it you're safe
[0:15:04] <+zooeymainbtw> but they are a good start
[0:15:04] <%generalve> WHAT
[0:15:06] <%robobeau> I thin kfor an ENOURMOUS game like GTA, I'd be OK with a $70 price tag, but for something like a Mario game, probably not?
[0:15:07] <mujahideenfruityrebels> The beatings will continue until moral improves
[0:15:08] <%ringabal> Always buy at 60% off sale or better
[0:15:09] <%SomersaultJustice> DKC or SF4, choose
[0:15:12] <+Rosen_Thorne> speaking of DKC, hey, that's on switch now!
[0:15:13] <+bokutachi_san> That fake Thousand Year Door tweet killed my soul :(
[0:15:32] <GenericSoda> I'd pick DKC
[0:15:32] <+Rosen_Thorne> does DKC have hakan? no sir, i think not. @SomersaultJustice
[0:15:37] <+Dimfish> games are still the cheapest form of entertainment out there for hours to dollars ratio
[0:15:38] <%Ranryu692> Ranryu692 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! I'm an anime watcher, so I'm sorry if someone has said this already: I googled X-Nauts to see if there is a consensus pronunciation, and while there isn't, I did find out that in the demo they were called Boomer Gangers, so do with that what you will lol
[0:15:39] <Prevot> GTA will sell even at 100, but Yakuza will struggle with just 10 more
[0:15:40] <%robobeau> SF4
[0:15:56] <JetpackMcQuack> In the end, this is just a markets thing unfortunately.
[0:15:58] <+Snipershot489> and people are still getting paid shit wages lol
[0:16:00] <%Graem> I can't afford games at one hundred Canadian and that's right where we are going
[0:16:00] <%SomersaultJustice> @Rosen_Thorne but he's talking about vanilla sf4 tho
[0:16:03] <petwisk> Master Race
[0:16:09] <Papa_Bearman> I already don't buy games at full-price; this is still pretty fucking disgusting considering lootbox culture.
[0:16:12] <jetstreamlover_ryocan> also straight up canging to the Switch
[0:16:20] <GenericSoda> @ranryu there's evidence it's pronounced cross much later on
[0:16:21] <+Rosen_Thorne> @SomersaultJustice ...touche.
[0:16:39] <%SirGO0SE> its a good thing that theres too many games now and theres no need to spend that much
[0:16:53] <Warbot40> Welp, origami king looks pretty meh
[0:17:03] <+magiclottie> Stacking BP is honestly the way to go
[0:17:07] <%starzo0> BP gang
[0:17:16] <+magiclottie> you can beat the game at 10 HP with little difficulty
[0:17:17] <%SirGO0SE> bp = best points
[0:17:24] <%SomersaultJustice> beeps
[0:17:29] <+phd_in_thuggery> BP = Benis Points
[0:17:31] <Papa_Bearman> I want to try four runs straight - balanced, HP only, BP only, and FP only. FP only sounds like Super Hard Mode to me.
[0:17:37] <%ringabal> Mario takes one step and his overalls start clacking with the weight of badges
[0:17:39] <mujahideenfruityrebels> Enabling Woolie’s addiction to BP
[0:17:43] <%Th3SmartAlec> ...Or you can just equip HP Plus
[0:17:49] <Prevot> there were bigger concerns at the beginning cause you were shit at action commands
[0:17:50] <milhousego> so how far do ya'll think we'll get today? also what chapter are we on again?
[0:17:51] <yogsbac0n> Stack Pickle Stone

[0:17:55] <sneekypotato> !runtime
[0:17:56] <ptmpopulatethemoon> I love just hearing woolie just talking about stuff.
[0:17:58] <+magiclottie> the HP and FP plus badges are kind of wastes tbh
[0:17:58] <petwisk> but quite franckly you should remove HP Plus
[0:18:13] <%SomersaultJustice> just be perfect 4Head
[0:18:14] <%SirGO0SE> get gud oneguy :)
[0:18:15] <GenericSoda> hp and fp plus are fine early
[0:18:17] <+magiclottie> i speak as someone who has played the game a lot, it's better to just get more damage out there without using those badges
[0:18:25] <+Snipershot489> I think you'll see as you go further into the chapters
[0:18:28] <%Solidnick18> ok
[0:18:35] <shiny_prinny> you can always just grind hp plus so it's all good
[0:18:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> Now get ready for a flood of HP comments on the next level up
[0:18:42] <@akuda_bar> woolie's plant hoodie grew on me. get it, it grew on me
[0:18:44] <mige_> 10hp runs are fun
[0:18:46] <%Ecchigun> woolieVS
[0:18:48] <+Snipershot489> Woolie you just fucking jinxed yourself
[0:18:51] <Prevot> you totally died
[0:18:56] <+magiclottie> honestly, if woolie stays low HP? he just needs super shrooms and life shrooms
[0:18:58] <%starzo0> @akuda_bar booo
[0:19:00] <%hawk_rush> woolie's now gonna get wiped next fight LUL
[0:19:01] <%Ecchigun> sup
[0:19:01] <%DatAsuna> yes
[0:19:02] <DragonSpooker> The Bombs
[0:19:02] <+zooeymainbtw> ye
[0:19:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> BIG WIPE
[0:19:05] <+phd_in_thuggery> FP & BP over HP in all runs imo
[0:19:05] <+Euphbugg> yup
[0:19:06] <%HeroVersusOfficial> The bombs
[0:19:07] <shiny_prinny> only lost to bombs but you can't game over in the Pit
[0:19:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> once, and that's because you were frozen
[0:19:08] <Prevot> you got 1-shot by bob-ombs
[0:19:11] <rubbishbinge> insta bomb wipe out
[0:19:11] <%chll0ne> tfw atlus finally ports smt 1 to switch but its japan only woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:19:12] <%Exiliator> Woolie justifying his paper mario build like if he was asked a question on tv talking about his political campaign LUL
[0:19:16] <+phd_in_thuggery> big ACCIDENT
[0:19:16] <Papa_Bearman> A death in the Glitz Pit isn't a "game over", but yes.
[0:19:19] <%cobalt_phoenix_> DOESN'T COUNT
[0:19:20] <%hawk_rush> @Exiliator LUL
[0:19:20] <milhousego> what chapter are we on?
[0:19:20] <%SomersaultJustice> he was booked to job that fight
[0:19:25] <%Th3SmartAlec> Doesn't count because Kayfabe
[0:19:28] <%ringabal> In hindsight Multibounce may not have been the best move
[0:19:32] <%elbigante> that was a mechanical wipe, not a difficulty thing
[0:19:32] <NotHereToStream> end of chapter 3
[0:19:32] <petwisk> @genericsoda is Trading a level for another is Just a waste of 3 badge points
[0:19:34] <%Proxzo> Bombs were a tactic not stats
[0:19:37] <Shwepie> Bomb wipe was more failing a mechanic than not having the right stats.
[0:19:37] <rubbishbinge> its a baby game so ultimately its fine
[0:19:43] <zeif00> They do have Quick Change atm, effectively massive amounts of hp
[0:19:45] <CrypticMochi> Those complaints sound people complaining about Liam running a defensive set in Paper Mario
[0:19:57] <JetpackMcQuack> I haven't gotten trapped in an RPG since I was 10
[0:20:00] <%dmcRedgrave> Also if I'm being honest, I think a lot of the people talking about the difficulty scaling up are remembering when they were kids and struggled, as opposed to full-grown adults.
[0:20:01] <+McSoliace> a lot of people are scared of losing
[0:20:15] <+magiclottie> honestly, at the end of the day if woolie keeps saving the game like he does?
[0:20:19] <+magiclottie> he's gonna be fine
[0:20:22] <%Exiliator> oh yeah that one
[0:20:24] <+tigerfang86> yo
[0:20:27] <%kingkeldeo31> OOOH
[0:20:28] <+tigerfang86> that sounds extreme
[0:20:32] <%Invlux> OH SHIT that manga is great
[0:20:33] <%ringabal> JACK ON
[0:20:34] <%FenixSeraph> PogChamp yeah it's got great art
[0:20:36] <zeif00> It's good
[0:20:38] <alephalpha> it's weird but it's really good
[0:20:39] <%FenixSeraph> also Amy Winehouse shows up
[0:20:40] <Prevot> wat
[0:20:42] <zeif00> Read it everyone
[0:20:43] <thegreatbambe> whats the name?
[0:20:44] <GenericSoda> @petwisk it depends on what youre up against, i guess. if you need hp to survive then its worth it
[0:20:48] <%ItsDrwOk> “The fear of losing will cause you to lose at life”- some guy
[0:20:49] <%AlteisenReiseZ> It’s honestly amazing
[0:20:51] <mujahideenfruityrebels> Sounds retarded
[0:20:54] <zeif00> Kurt Cobain is there
[0:20:59] <%AlteisenReiseZ> MUSIC STAND BATTLES
[0:20:59] <%kingkeldeo31> Shiori experience @thegreatbambe
[0:21:01] <%DatAsuna> seems in poor taste
[0:21:02] <zeif00> MUSIC STANDS
[0:21:03] <rubbishbinge> sounds like shaman king
[0:21:06] <%Exiliator> I mean, they are still dead
[0:21:09] <Snakes_dk> that sounds chill
[0:21:10] <%SomersaultJustice> Mic Stands
[0:21:12] <%Invlux> oh no, no reincarnation
[0:21:14] <alephalpha> no reincarnation but we use histircal people as characters all over the place
[0:21:21] <%ringabal> "No, Jimmy. You are not jacking into my neck again."
[0:21:21] <%Exiliator> they are just getting coached by ghosts
[0:21:23] <+phd_in_thuggery> It focuses on the dynamic of building a band learning to improve yourself.
[0:21:24] <%Invlux> the ghost just hangs out
[0:21:24] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:21:33] <%Graem> Recently dead. Gotta be dead for a hundred years min
[0:21:38] <%HeroVersusOfficial> @WoolieVersus Have you seen DMC (Detroit Metal City)?
[0:21:38] <niozonbi> Doesn't we do that with war heroes all the time?
[0:21:41] <%DatAsuna> mild take: calling something a stand makes me instantly stop taking you seriously
[0:21:42] <zeif00> Yeah they just hang and play music through people
[0:21:44] <Prevot> hopefully ghost MJ isn't hanging out with a young japanese boy too
[0:21:47] <%SirGO0SE> idk woolie youre selling it pretty well right now
[0:21:48] <+Deano8817> Are we sure Kira isn't actually david bowie tho?
[0:21:49] <EL_TRO> what ya'll talking about?
[0:21:49] <%FenixSeraph> be glad Kurt Cobain isn't a 12 year old girl
[0:21:50] <alephalpha> think about ti being a sports manag about doing what you liove and responsibilites other stuff it works prettyw ell as a whole
[0:21:52] <%ItsDrwOk> I hate to be that guy but does anyone else hear a ring?
[0:21:52] <ProfessorLuigi> BUT THINK ABOUT how COOL THAT WOULD BE
[0:21:52] <dreadedcthulhu> reminds me of when Barack Obama showed up in air gear
[0:21:55] <%jiggy_snipe> that sounds pretty cool
[0:21:59] <petwisk> @genericsoda i generaly resolve that by smartly spending my levels (2 levels Badge points folowed by 1 FP and one HP)

[0:24:57] <rubbishbinge> why would you
[0:25:11] <%Graem> QA is no longer a leadin to a real vg job and hasn't been for many years
[0:25:17] <%Slimshazbot> Slimshazbot subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Hey Woolie! What is your favorite mech SIZE? I love me a good towering stupid big robot, but my ideal would probably be the size of Titans in Titanfall.
[0:25:19] <%hawk_rush> I did QA (not video game tho), was able to become a software engineer through doing it
[0:25:33] <%ItsDrwOk> @persona_ex wait if you’re not using headphones you might not hear it
[0:25:36] <+phd_in_thuggery> my dad constantly told me "Video Game QA is where careers go to die"
[0:25:57] <%ringabal> QA sounds like the dishwashers of the game industry
[0:26:06] <+TheDyingPride> If you are willing to hate life for a few years, video game QA is wonderful to get in the door
[0:26:18] <%Th3SmartAlec> @phd_in_thuggery Your Dad looking at Woolie: "What form of power is this?!"
[0:26:19] <+TheDyingPride> But you're not allowed to leave the doormat.
[0:26:20] <JetpackMcQuack> Just be aware that it is the "Salmon swimming up a river" approach
[0:26:29] <+CounterBeard> QA was how my buddy ended up as a voice actor/voice director. But he also busted his ass for years to get there.
[0:26:39] <%HeroVersusOfficial> QA isn't a bad thing but it pays like garbage, but it'll give you industry experience. Crunches, long hours, bug finding, so on
[0:26:42] <%Theycallmenerf> What is up chat
[0:26:54] <%Exiliator> And you get to see the dark side of video games
[0:27:02] <+phd_in_thuggery> @th3smartalec to be fair he did have a few friends who went into it and they ended up leaving or becoming homeless in LA
[0:27:03] <%Exiliator> Dont work were you eat!
[0:27:06] <%Theycallmenerf> I was curious about QA jobs since I had some offers on them.
[0:27:14] <$FusRoDom> Junior Roles are EXTREMELY rare though... Everyone is hiring Senior positions these days because devs are getting burned out and leaving.
[0:27:20] <+phd_in_thuggery> so that was his exposure to QA work

[0:30:07] <%ringabal> Isn't it nutz that these hardcore jobs are solely dedicated towards public entertainment?
[0:30:11] <%HeroVersusOfficial> @WoolieVersus Once you reach a certain point, you need to make horizontal moves. QA only goes up to a certain point before you need to switch departments.
[0:30:20] <%ItsDrwOk> From the corner to kingpin

[0:30:48] <+magiclottie> @WoolieVersus can you keep talking for like 15 more minutes so i can make lunch? JK

[0:31:03] <%RichochetForce> @JetpackMcQuack Exactly. Businesses are NOT loyal.

[0:31:58] <+TheDyingPride> That Tinnitus buddy @ItsDrwOk

[0:32:42] <jellssssss20> some parts of laggan
[0:32:42] <%RichochetForce> Yeah, BT has a good size
[0:32:44] <+Jessie_Lockhart> Retail is awful. I worked it for about 15 years and it sucks.
[0:32:47] <%Proxzo> I like all sizes, but definitely on the smaller scale.
[0:32:50] <+Juriasu> I always though code geass had well sized mecha
[0:32:52] <%RichochetForce> It still allows in-door environments to be used
[0:32:55] <twieetcha> Pat sized robot
[0:32:56] <%Exiliator> Zearth size is pretty good

[0:33:19] <%Proxzo> If you need to pay rent and eat while you work on what you really want, then maybe
[0:33:21] <%2hutown> I like the larger sizes that can accommodate partner/teams
[0:33:21] <%RichochetForce> @CounterBeard Exactly
[0:33:21] <jellssssss20> Vanguard armor?
[0:33:22] <alephalpha> well if you think about practicality then we no longer have mechs
[0:33:23] <+Jessie_Lockhart> But I’m not really a people person and I tend to take my time on things. Not really conducive to a retail envirnoment
[0:33:26] <%Solidnick18> we do it
[0:33:28] <%Lunatyr_> I like the titanfall size since they can enter buildings but still be in a big mech

[2:03:18] <+AbnormalVoid> What are you waiting for! Run out the door and find that child!
[2:03:19] <%Solidnick18> a few nights ago

[2:03:26] <resloxxx> monkaS
[2:03:26] <+Lazyjoules> The happen all the time here unfortunately :(
[2:03:27] <bbblaketwitching> which is nice
[2:03:27] <%Cozy90> amber alerts are pretty uunerving when you get them
[2:03:28] <@SoushinSen> i just received my first amber alert ever.
[2:03:33] <Prevot> oh no not the peadows again
[2:03:34] <@Menitta> Amber alerts are frequent down here in MD NotLikeThis
[2:03:35] <%LoVezineTheAir> they happen super rarely
[2:03:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> at least it wasn't a false alarm about nukes
[2:03:37] <%Graem> We got them all he time a year ago or something in southern Ontario
[2:03:37] <heart_ablaze> who is amber and why is she altering me
[2:03:39] <Cynical_Canadian> My phone never goes off for some reason
[2:03:39] <+ladomania> I get them semi often
[2:03:41] <$QueequegTheater> GOd damn peadows
[2:03:41] <$Superdandy96> I hope it wasn’t for anything bad
[2:03:42] <SunsetJack> Dood, it was last year.
[2:03:42] <+TheDyingPride> I get those all the time here in the US
[2:03:43] <%hawk_rush> @SoushinSen yo minh
[2:03:43] <%cdrom321> Amber alert: Paper Mario has stolen my childlike innocence.
[2:03:44] <JonKhan> Sleeping during the day sucks when amber alerts are a thing.
[2:03:46] <%Nomad94> what's an amber alert
[2:03:46] <+Zenryoku21> lots of amber alerts in midwest
[2:03:46] <nyacoo> There is (1) Smash player in the vicinity
[2:03:46] <%Invlux> Minh got it too
[2:03:47] <%Solidnick18> i was sleeping when it went off
[2:03:48] <Syrushmx> what is that?
[2:03:48] <glass_marcus> Imagine only having only one amber alert in your life
[2:03:48] <%crimsonphoenix69> I had it too
[2:03:49] <letshavecakes> Damn those meadows
[2:03:49] <Hyper_charger> they're every other week here in texas
[2:03:49] <%Superbro64> We get amber alerts here at least monthly @woolieversus
[2:03:52] <%HitchhikingThrough> Man luck you guys
[2:03:52] <Rav_Rabies> I usually get them at 3am
[2:03:53] <@Menitta> wait
[2:03:54] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Amber Alert happens all the time in the US
[2:03:55] <abelincoln_catpuncher> we get a lot down here in Cali
[2:03:55] <@Menitta> wtf
[2:03:55] <LaikaCDP> cause ya'll in canada in the US we get em all the time
[2:03:56] <citerel> having a bunch of people get one in a classroom is an experience
[2:03:58] <exnuart> you should be freaked out when theres a missing kid
[2:03:58] <Papa_Bearman> I remember a couple years ago when Trump mandated pretty much everyone's phone goes off at the same time. Super annoying, and he hasn't used it since.
[2:03:59] <%Solidnick18> yeah
[2:04:02] <straycatrock> as a non-north american amber alerts are fucking weird to me
[2:04:02] <@SoushinSen> i was like... What the fuck is this alarm sound like it's the end of the world? i couldn't tell where the sound came from
[2:04:03] <%Cozy90> in L.A. i saw them too often :(
[2:04:03] <%HitchhikingThrough> @WoolieVersus US amber alerts are a PITA
[2:04:04] <bbblaketwitching> M E A D O W S
[2:04:05] <%hawk_rush> I get quite a lot in Toronto
[2:04:08] <ppbghd> AA: keep an eye out for a gray car somewhere
[2:04:08] <+SwerveBootyHammer> I got a tornado warning the other day and it scared the shit out of me
[2:04:09] <%HitchhikingThrough> OH GOD THAT HIT
[2:04:10] <%Solidnick18> alot here in mid west
[2:04:12] <%dmcRedgrave> It was Hawaii yeah

[2:04:16] <+Froyuken> Need Alisha alerts.
[2:04:20] <glass_marcus> I can remember like 5 amber alerts in my life
[2:04:20] <%ozmon> The "This is not a drill" drill
[2:04:23] <%RadicalWeegee> O O F Scary
[2:04:23] <+Jaysky> I often get amber alerts at night and it kills the battery
[2:04:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yea, the button for the test and the real thing are like next to each other and they misclicked
[2:04:25] <bbblaketwitching> thats bad enough to make me laugh
[2:04:27] <%Invlux> If you've ever got an amber alert while in a grocery store, it's wild bc it all goes off at once
[2:04:27] <%MontresorMeal> Oh, the nuclear launch thing.
[2:04:32] <%SuperKirby24> yea that was amega oof
[2:04:32] <%Graem> That missile alert was terrifying
[2:04:33] <neroforte177> theres a lot in texas
[2:04:35] <Hyper_charger> yeah the Hawaiian nuke alert was absurd
[2:04:37] <JetpackMcQuack> go inside i guess monkaS
[2:04:37] <bbblaketwitching> it wrapped around twice
[2:04:38] <exnuart> some dude fucked his sister during that hawaii missle thing
[2:04:41] <%FuqBoiSlim> I havent gotten an amber alert in like 6 months but that might be just cuz I dont update my phone
[2:04:47] <%Doplghost> I remember the guy who called the alert said that "he did what he was trained to do."
[2:04:49] <%emeraldskrull> woolieDATTEBAYO woolieTRASH woolieGASM
[2:04:49] <+phd_in_thuggery> I got an Amber Alert a few months ago that nearly made me crash my car, shit was fucked

[2:20:45] <%DatAsuna> The pit gives you one like this for free later
[2:20:46] <HeavyC4> but the first attack SAVES TIME
[2:20:48] <+QuadraticGravity> @CursedNobleman Too early.
[2:20:48] <+Lazyjoules> if the WHOLE FIGHT would give 1 xp, it gives coins
[2:20:49] <%Proxzo> weak enemies dont give EXP anyways
[2:20:51] <bbblaketwitching> JUMPING IS ALWAYS BEST
[2:20:51] <+FistOcuffs9> theyre too weak, so they wouldnt give xp anyway
[2:20:53] <NiktenKing> Still worth
[2:20:53] <+VorpalSlash> You wouldn't get XP regardless
[2:20:53] <+TheDyingPride> You probably would only get 1 anyway
[2:20:53] <CastellanVon> Weaker enemies don't give xp
[2:20:53] <+Nexttime000> Gale Force is full exp too
[2:20:53] <%RichochetForce> Correct
[2:20:53] <TheHotStuven> For enemies that dont give real EXP
[2:20:53] <+zooeymainbtw> ye
[2:20:54] <Louie_Salmon> Enemies wouldn't really give it anyway, yeah
[2:20:54] <bbblaketwitching> thats true
[2:20:54] <shiny_prinny> it's for when the world map is getting annoying to traverse
[2:20:56] <%cdrom321> This applies to enemies that wouldn't give Star Points anyway.
[2:20:56] <%chosenjuan42> ITS GOOD FOR BACKTRACKING
[2:20:58] <%CursedNobleman> @QuadraticGravity :( Drat
[2:20:58] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:20:59] <+Grayhammatter> i mean, it'd be only 1 point
[2:20:59] <%hawk_rush> yep
[2:20:59] <+GreenCMD> it only cancels fights with 1 xp
[2:21:00] <%Ancopro> good for back tracking yup
[2:21:00] <NiktenKing> Coins for badges and items
[2:21:00] <+FistOcuffs9> its not really worth it
[2:21:04] <+pectusumbra> Just bop em
[2:21:05] <niozonbi> Doesn't work in the pit tho
[2:21:09] <%ItsDrwOk> It saves time
[2:21:12] <BlackermanZX> delete the weak
[2:21:12] <%Proxzo> Weak enemies dont give exp anyways
[2:21:12] <Papa_Bearman> Just boop that snoot.
[2:21:17] <%Invlux> that's amazing
[2:21:18] <%LoVezineTheAir> only wear it when backtracking tho
[2:21:24] <+Wilabeen1997> If the fight would give only 1 xp, totally worth
[2:21:33] <%donpatrondx> fdont wear in new areas
[2:21:35] <bbblaketwitching> WHICH IS MUCH BETTER
[2:21:38] <Louie_Salmon> Uh
[2:21:39] <bbblaketwitching> NO
[2:21:41] <%emeraldskrull> woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO
[2:21:42] <bbblaketwitching> NOOO
[2:21:42] <Drusain> lol
[2:21:43] <+QuadraticGravity> NO
[2:21:43] <%lotharrio> I think that was a joke.
[2:21:44] <sirmcslushers> Proooob not
[2:21:44] <Afterman_> unless youre the kind of cruncher willing to farm 1,000 enemies for 10 levels
[2:21:44] <%Th3SmartAlec> NOOOOOOOO
[2:21:44] <bbblaketwitching> BIG NO
[2:21:45] <+marumariball> you cant attack

[2:21:46] <%chosenjuan42> no
[2:21:47] <SixthSun2> That'd cancel each other out
[2:21:47] <%ozmon> Won't they cancel out?
[2:21:48] <%Pop_O_Matic> snoop boots
[2:21:49] <%krispen_wa> NOOO
[2:21:50] <bbblaketwitching> BIGGEST NO
[2:21:50] <Bguy32> No it does t work
[2:21:50] <+Grayhammatter> i think that was joke
[2:21:51] <Louie_Salmon> That was probably a joke LUL
[2:21:52] <niozonbi> DO IT
[2:21:52] <%LoVezineTheAir> ONE GUY
[2:21:53] <MasterMushin> Yeah do it!
[2:21:55] <shiny_prinny> i think you would just lose both commands lol
[2:21:56] <niozonbi> YEYE
[2:21:58] <+VorpalSlash> Do it Kappa
[2:21:59] <+TheDyingPride> Wouldn't equipping both just make it so you can't use either
[2:21:59] <%chosenjuan42> can't do both
[2:22:00] <Syrushmx> NOUP
[2:22:00] <%Proxzo> yea then just equip power plus for that
[2:22:00] <+Wilabeen1997> Nope
[2:22:01] <+QuadraticGravity> It doesn't -1, it deletes your commands tho
[2:22:05] <elbyboxus> it doesnt minus power tho it just denies
[2:22:06] <Papa_Bearman> Your attack power would go up by 2 but you couldn't attack.
[2:22:06] <Cynical_Canadian> Do you still need timing tutor?
[2:22:07] <%Pop_O_Matic> Yeah, if you use both you end not being able to attack
[2:22:07] <+Grayhammatter> reggie, don't listen to chat LUL
[2:22:09] <bbblaketwitching> I'm not joking, thats the worst idea
[2:22:10] <twieetcha> One guy
[2:22:11] <sirmcslushers> So, Woolie, might be some new places you can go with VIOLENCE.

[2:22:47] <Louie_Salmon> Oh yeah, refund
[2:22:48] <%ozmon> There's also some enemies that are impervious to fire
[2:22:49] <+QuadraticGravity> @WoolieVersus You can remove Charge, the buff just isn't good enough to lose a turn on attacks.
[2:22:50] <+Nexttime000> cause gale force is kind of bustedly powerful
[2:22:52] <SixthSun2> Refund?
[2:22:56] <+Lazyjoules> Refund for sure
[2:22:58] <+TheDyingPride> Super appeal is wasted slots IMO
[2:23:05] <+Wilabeen1997> Refund

[2:59:07] <delta278899> There's a star piece by the trash can in west rougeport.
[2:59:07] <+TheDyingPride> trade your HP and FP up badge for POWER
[2:59:09] <%marshalmorphino2> UNLIMITED POWER
[2:59:10] <+marumariball> would be a good idea for builds
[2:59:12] <bbblaketwitching> thats 6 damage with multibounce
[2:59:13] <%astrofalcon1> customize your mario
[2:59:16] <%Ancopro> you using appeal?
[2:59:17] <+geosspone> HP Plus is a scam
[2:59:19] <HeavyC4> Appeal can go to hell
[2:59:20] <Louie_Salmon> Charge is good for bosses
[2:59:21] <KatabolicRage> super appeal can probably be dropped, it's a bit niche
[2:59:22] <Afterman_> take off both apeals!!
[2:59:22] <+Rosen_Thorne> wouldn't the attack up negate the charge?
[2:59:24] <HenryHenshin> did you get the bag upgrade yet?
[2:59:25] <%ozmon> LOL
[2:59:25] <HeavyC4> HP plus can go straight to hell

[2:59:44] <%ozmon> I can't fit Power Plus into my schedule... OR CAN I...?
[2:59:45] <+Rosen_Thorne> Stylish makes up for the super appeals
[2:59:46] <+Lazyjoules> Drop the appeals
[2:59:47] <reonome> first atttack
[2:59:47] <+marumariball> you can get appeal from all the stylish actions

[2:59:54] <+gespenst25> is 30 the most you can ever have?
[2:59:56] <Louie_Salmon> Could take away HP plus, and maybe some small things?
[2:59:57] <niozonbi> Timing tutor and first attack
[3:00:00] <%astrofalcon1> time to do some 4d chess
[3:00:01] <HenryHenshin> timing tutor

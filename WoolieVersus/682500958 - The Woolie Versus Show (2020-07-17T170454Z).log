[0:19:09] <%YakumoYomi> @a_goth_pancake Apparently, we haven't gotten an F-Zero because they can't think of a way to "innovate the gameplay". Meanwhile, I'm just sitting here like "Why do you need to innovate?"

[0:20:43] <%PadreHail> Origami King is fine but I would HARDLY call it innovative
[0:20:43] <Prevot> I wonder who told the Paper Mario devs they're not allowwd to make good gameplay

[0:21:29] <%PadreHail> Origami King lookin like a solid 7

[0:27:17] <%honeyman18> Is it pretty as I hoped?
[0:27:18] <%Typhaeon> Perfect score in Famitsu, which is pretty remarkable
[0:27:20] <SolSwagGuy56> We need just a straigh DBFZ 2

[0:27:29] <%0rond> @WoolieVersus no problem but can we have a "currently playing" part on this screen
[0:27:31] <jellssssss20> Ghosts of sushi soon?
[0:27:33] <Badpest> bobberComfy rooComfy
[0:27:34] <OldManDeckardCain> I thought woolie was gonna play deadly premonition 2 with this loading times LUL
[0:27:37] <KaironFortressKnight> keep the good songs coming Woolz, it's all good
[0:27:38] <TheDr0t> game's so fucking cewl tho
[0:27:38] <majindusto> Song?
[0:27:39] <halfmasks> @woolieversus its all good
[0:27:39] <+TheOneCalledRock> i watched the AGC review of this game and he said it's a must buy so i think i might get it sometime down the line
[0:27:41] <ZeeJiggle> God Trunks' theme is so good
[0:27:43] <laguerrilha> @Menitta is Meta Knight or Glacta Knight a "Kirby" species too or thats racist?
[0:27:45] <%generalve> " take your time" - Person 5
[0:27:50] <%generalve> PERSONA 5

[0:27:56] <SolSwagGuy56> Usagi why
[0:27:58] <%a_goth_pancake> no rush, man. enjoying these fucken bangers
[0:28:00] <TheDr0t> sandstorm
[0:28:01] <+TheOneCalledRock> i hae been burned out of open world games so im not sure
[0:28:05] <%generalve> woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY
[0:28:14] <%lewdskeletor13> The open world is really good in this game
[0:28:15] <Frozenflame01> Man can't wait for Woolie Dreadlock Samurai to begin
[0:28:17] <%SuperKirby24> woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY
[0:28:27] <maria_luke> So this is Trunks' theme? for what game?
[0:28:28] <DianaTheAscian> my hopes are getting up that were getting v-tuber woolie
[0:28:31] <@Menitta> person 5. you work at a five guys and have social links
[0:28:32] <SolSwagGuy56> If you need to get your samurai ninja fox Nioh is still there in the corner trying to get your attention
[0:28:37] <SolSwagGuy56> fix*
[0:28:39] <Prevot> I'll buy this like I buy all AC games, 6 months later for half the price
[0:28:47] <%YakumoYomi> @SolSwagGuy56 I don't think she was a Fire Ant, but Niku Drill has a book out that involves an ant colony kidnapping males for "purposes". Niku Drill is definitely recommended if you want to get your fix of "nonstandard" monster girls.
[0:28:47] <DianaTheAscian> iam ready for disappointment
[0:28:52] <Shishi1205> Instead of gaining social links you lose them
[0:28:55] <@Menitta> Nioh 2 is stellar
[0:28:56] <+MechArch> i would lose my shit if woolie streamed as a v tuber for this one. but he seems like a coward to me..
[0:28:58] <%Typhaeon> Cue endless arguments about whether burgers or fries are the superior waifu
[0:29:00] <%a_goth_pancake> who TF orders red meat well done? I have ages to sit here in chat.
[0:29:01] <SociopathicApe> Is this the game about the samurai who tries to get his sushi back?
[0:29:03] <XzileGaming> my whole work break and STILL no game
[0:29:06] <SolSwagGuy56> @YakumoYomi Kreygasm
[0:29:07] <+gaemjurnalist> god vtuber woolie and ghosts of sushi-mah would be the weebiest thing
[0:29:15] <SolSwagGuy56> Nioh 2 deserved more shine
[0:29:18] <%PadreHail> Symphony of the Night pog
[0:29:18] <%jetjagger222> tragic prince
[0:29:24] <CraftofPaper> VTUBER WOOLIE
[0:29:24] <%CaptainPileDriver> i wish i could like nioh
[0:29:28] <@Menitta> It's easily my favorite souls-like game
[0:29:28] <T_Sasquatch> Seriously this is one of the best open world games out there and this generation. Fuck new assassins creed
[0:29:32] <+TheOneCalledRock> the last open world game that I massively enjoyed is PS4 Spiderman. it helps when you make traversing your open world fun
[0:29:34] <laguerrilha> SourPls SourPls
[0:29:37] <%generalve> CASTLEVANIA IN MY VEINS
[0:29:41] <%honeyman18> Would Woolie be a jojo villain or Hero?
[0:29:46] <%SuperKirby24> fuck, why does that opening riff sound like it belongs in a wrestling game
[0:29:49] <Goraka91> @T_Sasquatch But you can have Viking rap battles though
[0:29:50] <DianaTheAscian> SourPls
[0:29:50] <%lewdskeletor13> If they ever do Yakuza I think the art needs to be Woolie as Majima and Reggie as Kiryu
[0:29:50] <SolSwagGuy56> Please buy Bloodstained: Curse of the MOon 2

[1:05:24] <dukenux> this whole game is very AC
[1:05:26] <42nfl19> @WoolieVersus Heads up, apparently the lip sync is off cause this was originally recorded in English first.
[1:05:26] <+JingKaisean> Sekiro 2: Electric Boogaloo
[1:05:27] <VerpeiltVerpixelt> I'm already forgiving this game the forced eng lip syncing, as the japanese voice actors REALLY do a great job *__*
[1:05:32] <KeroKamina> the Assassin's Creed Japan we've all been waitign for
[1:05:33] <+LeaIsChill> Oh Minh is in in
[1:05:34] <VidulaSaix> (Angry intake of breath) LUL
[1:05:34] <cacophanes> angry intake of breath
[1:05:37] <+ohzassy> Im just sayin', brudda! Dese Japanese need a little direction!
[1:05:37] <%Javaa01> Or more specifically, even closer to modern Splinter Cell
[1:05:38] <+BaronVonWolfe> Aaaaand favorite character right away. What a bad bitch.
[1:05:38] <+johnny_gogo> better AC
[1:05:39] <mdmzerop> that crouch walk animation is kind of jank
[1:05:40] <GenericTwitchAcc1> (angry intake of breath)
[1:05:40] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> This game is more Assassin's Creed than Assassin's Creed now
[1:05:42] <Prevot> this is the Japan AC Ubisoft refused to make
[1:05:43] <%lewdskeletor13> Assassins Creed but good
[1:05:44] <gag5y> it's fuckin stealthier than AC Valhalla
[1:05:51] <VidulaSaix> Chotto matte
[1:05:55] <%DesDavis> @42nfl19 they know
[1:05:56] <dukenux> The only Assassin's Creed: Japan you'll get Kappa
[1:05:56] <cipher758> kill all them mongols bruddah
[1:05:58] <T_Sasquatch> Its like sekiro assassin's creed imo
[1:06:01] <+johnny_gogo> @chiazamformerlymankeyfigh Very true
[1:06:01] <%ChoculaUltra> welp, that saves me some cash
[1:06:06] <mexicansunglasses> this is as boring as ass creed tho.
[1:06:15] <+solzan2000> I don't agree
[1:06:21] <%JohnAtDawn> KANEDA
[1:06:22] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> TETSUOOOOO!
[1:06:25] <spidervenomized> @gag5y almost every game is more assassin creed now
[1:06:25] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> It's not all stealth missions
[1:06:25] <slix3431> Castle Canada
[1:06:27] <VidulaSaix> 15 minutes into a game and chat "THIS IS BORING"
[1:06:28] <+Arkfyre> @gag5y nice comparison to a game that's not even out yet
[1:06:30] <%lewdskeletor13> CANADA
[1:06:30] <%mechslayer71> @mexicansunglasses Based off of 15 minutes?
[1:06:33] <Meltgar> Maybe because it's the prologue? lytSORRYPAL

[1:07:01] <%Livelinne> Muh uncle BibleThump
[1:07:05] <%FuqBoiSlim> Prologue?? more like SNORElogue Kappa
[1:07:07] <gag5y> @Arkfyre have you seen the 30 minute gameplay trailer all they showed is shouting while raiding and also YOU CAN STSCK ROCKS
[1:07:08] <%CaptainPileDriver> @ianrspc he had a poll, we voted for japanese so who cares.

[1:07:16] <%eyezehuhh> Chat is being invaded by woolieONEGUY s
[1:07:17] <VidulaSaix> The JP cast are all very good actors but I don't feel it fits at all for the game.
[1:07:18] <GenericTwitchAcc1> but muh huhun tho BibleThump
[1:07:20] <Flare3500> F
[1:07:25] <Pharamos> Hi Woolie!
[1:07:25] <%allups> thy lips might not match but least the emotional reading of the lines still carry over and the expressions seem to match.
[1:07:32] <derap41> Its both
[1:07:32] <gag5y> Also my uncle works for Ubisoft
[1:07:34] <+tuchpi> bitches in chat salty about not being able to minimize LUL
[1:07:35] <Setaro> Looks so pretty :O
[1:07:37] <DianaTheAscian> yes
[1:07:38] <spidervenomized> you determine
[1:07:39] <halfmasks> i saved u cause i need your help b-baka
[1:07:44] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> yeah sometimes
[1:07:46] <Riorii> i think its a big thing that you decide that yourself
[1:07:50] <%lewdskeletor13> It’s your choice most of the time
[1:07:51] <+Double_Tap_That> According to the talks about the games development, it's up to you.
[1:07:52] <%mechslayer71> You determine for a good bit of it
[1:07:53] <Shishi1205> That animation looks strange to say the least
[1:07:54] <shadow_ninja_83> Wasssup
[1:07:55] <42nfl19> Jito the game is called sneaky ghost stab stab not For Honor
[1:08:00] <Hammatime8> R2 is an odd interact button, but okay
[1:08:01] <TheDr0t> just wait for THAT moment in tutorial
[1:08:04] <Shishi1205> That's not how you squeezed through things
[1:08:05] <JetpackMcQuack> pick your samurai
[1:08:07] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> The game will force you into stealth and non-stealth missions
[1:08:07] <dukenux> yeah the lip sync is prolly the biggest flaw so far
[1:08:12] <Flare3500> It's the tutorial so it's probably giving your bearing for now
[1:08:19] <%StaceMcGate> Will Woolie be honorable or dishonorable Samurai?
[1:08:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> who cares about the lip sybc
[1:08:22] <xbb1024> level up your character how you want
[1:08:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> &sync
[1:08:26] <Rigid_Iguana> most likely just a fail state right
[1:08:26] <%Javaa01> If you get spotted NOW, you game over
[1:08:26] <skewerstar> I wonder if there's gonna be a bit where you're crawling and someone above you stabs the ground and narrowly misses you?
[1:08:28] <sileo_patronus> Probably instant fail
[1:08:32] <%Javaa01> Because this mission is scipted
[1:08:40] <slix3431> @StaceMcGate He's not 10 mins in and he is already lying
[1:08:43] <Shishi1205> God they are garbage guards
[1:08:43] <%lewdskeletor13> This is one of the few wholly stealth sectioned
[1:08:53] <skewerstar> PUNCH THE MONGOLS!
[1:08:54] <%saraizarai> So far this very similar ot the start of Sekiro

[1:12:28] <allups> nope
[1:12:30] <%CursedNobleman> RAN is the best Kurosawa film
[1:12:31] <stevo_scar> There's no lock on mechanic

[1:13:06] <%Livelinne> Kurosawa's Dream was interesting
[1:13:08] <%saraizarai> I'm not sure I like "the weight" behind attacks. They seem significantly too light. Like play fighting, not actual fighting
[1:13:08] <%lewdskeletor13> You lock on to whoever you’re nearest to
[1:13:12] <+johnny_gogo> gotta fight like a big strong coward
[1:13:13] <Flare3500> Lock on is considered dishonorable
[1:13:13] <ianrspc> just play the game, they'll tell you everything as you go
[1:13:19] <Riorii> you will figure it out when there are multiple enemies
[1:13:19] <Daxalog> lockon is dishonourable and for scrubs which i am not

[2:00:29] <DatAsuna> Nioh has rad kusari tech
[2:00:29] <%MacabreOpus> Just tell the enemy you wish to speak to their manager
[2:00:29] <JetpackMcQuack> So you want to maim yourself
[2:00:30] <+ohzassy> Kusarigama is such an objectively good weapon
[2:00:30] <%scrumbotime> Kusarigama were fuckin' BALLER in Nioh 2
[2:00:31] <Professor_Dr_Muffins> spin to win!
[2:00:32] <+BubbaRands> KUNAI WITH CHAIN
[2:00:35] <badluck777> kunia with chain
[2:00:37] <T_Sasquatch> You don't let them get close range
[2:00:38] <%CursedNobleman> kusari gama is for posers LUL
[2:00:38] <laguerrilha> @WoolieVersus at close range you can use as a pole to beat the enemy and get distance
[2:00:38] <BigFreki> Kunai wit chain

[2:01:08] <+krabsan> Best episode in samurai champloo was when they fought the chain and sickle dude
[2:01:08] <AThing_> @deviljhojho_ The mongols got to hungary, I don't think they stayed tho
[2:01:09] <%FuqBoiSlim> the Kusarigama in Toukiden is utterly based btw
[2:01:12] <%StaceMcGate> Huns invaded Rome
[2:01:15] <lucain_wreath> I choose gun!
[2:01:15] <Flare3500> But Pat said Mongolia isn't real

[2:02:30] <axelkaspar> Spears can be used in close combat, and you can have a dagger as backup if you practice switching

[2:06:48] <thetrashman_sc> Kyodai
[2:06:51] <Hideow> God the voice acting is incredible
[2:06:53] <jorniev> ZORO
[2:06:56] <BlackermanZX> I like Zoro's VA

[2:07:02] <+froduck42> And Mugen
[2:07:03] <%jetjagger222> i can't unhear zoro now
[2:07:04] <@akuda_bar> this is Zoro's VA
[2:07:07] <jorniev> HOW IS THE GAME WOOLIE!?
[2:07:09] <Flare3500> I'm just waiting for him to shout SANTORYU !!
[2:07:14] <+Sernious> lol zoro got lost and ended up in this game

[2:07:22] <Shishi1205> Im pretty sure zoro getting lost is bc of his swords curse
[2:07:28] <+luftraumm1> vagabond is cool and all but historic musashi and the niten ichi ryu sword style is way more awesome and real
[2:07:29] <Prevot> Im not buying this until they announce santoryu DLC
[2:07:29] <%Pillagius> OK... I'm not crazy :D
[2:07:30] <Shishi1205> Preloguetown he didnt get lost

[2:07:41] <%eyezehuhh> She talking him up
[2:07:54] <+phatmac16> don't think Zoro's VA fits this character, but it's still cool
[2:07:55] <bustawof> when does jin learn 6 sword style and shouts lets party
[2:07:56] <+MrRanseur> he totally did in Usopps island tho
[2:07:57] <+luftraumm1> niten ichi ryu takes a lot of Inspiration from taike players

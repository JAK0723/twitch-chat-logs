[0:15:55] <Meltgar> I'm expecting a Woolie Kart racer
[0:16:02] <turf_wind_and_fire> What's the tier rankings for kart racers? Like Mario, Crash, Sonic, South Park?
[0:16:08] <%itsmostlynick> itsmostlynick subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 3 month streak! What's going on everyone?
[0:16:09] <+LeslieIsBestli> The Sonic and Sega All Stars games were good on their own tbh

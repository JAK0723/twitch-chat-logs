[0:04:34] <andrei11dr> Ahh some perfect disyraction for my grinding
[0:04:36] <%Double_Tap_That> Double_Tap_That subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! Hope you didn't like how expressive and an actual character Doom Slayer was, cause good ol' Gordon is the exact opposite.
[0:04:37] <Hawkbone_> I can't believe Woolie is doing a Half-Life speedrun
[0:04:39] <MassConnect> now that we're not messing with pat, is there REALLY karma in this?
[0:04:39] <+HeavyMetalIceCream> had wolly ever played HL before?
[0:04:44] <KnivesEve> came just in time

[0:04:46] <Solidnick18> @FuqBoiSlim it's half life
[0:04:46] <+heroicspiritavenger> Woolie should play Leisure Suit Larry on stream
[0:04:49] <$deadredeyez> hec yea
[0:04:53] <lotharrio> @BlueMoonBlues Depends on how many jetpacks they give him. If one or more, he's going full traitor for them.
[0:05:01] <GoodShotCam> yes he should
[0:05:04] <%RioGascar> From what woolie has said he has played portal 1 and 2
[0:05:14] <Dean_Inbetween> hello gordon
[0:05:15] <%RioGascar> Since he knows space core and wheatly
[0:05:15] <+HeavyMetalIceCream> that sounds right
[0:05:20] <Man_in_the_Red> @lotharrio Black Mesa has a high jump pack, they can bribe back

[0:05:54] <lotharrio> @Man_in_the_Red It didn't stop Woolie from wanting to give up his lower body to join the aliens in XCom2, despite the human jetpacks being better.
[0:05:54] <Dean_Inbetween> time to play another series that only makes woolie sad

[0:14:40] <+DeathByAttempt> Preparing for unforseen pogsiquences
[0:14:40] <%RioGascar> Steam
[0:14:44] <%RioGascar> the answer is steam
[0:14:46] <+DeathByAttempt> PogChamp PogChamp
[0:14:46] <Hawkbone_> The crowbar is to Gordon as the chainsaw is to Doomguy
[0:14:47] <arkv01> dude when I played OG half life 1 I got motion sickness REALLY bad
[0:14:53] <pennykettle_> can we make sure he knows this is one of those games where you better smartly quicksave
[0:14:55] <MayorRev> Swing Crow Barman @arkv01
[0:14:56] <Solidnick18> Crowbar chan Kreygasm
[0:14:57] <+heroicspiritavenger> The original Half Life was a DOOM mod wasn’t it?
[0:15:03] <%Irridium> after beating this you should take a look at old Xen because boy howdy did they fix that shit
[0:15:04] <HeavyNorse> I've never played any of the Half-Life games or even seen it being played other than a few clips here and there, so this is gonna be cool. ^^
[0:15:06] <lotharrio> If you never played HL, then don't get overly excited about it. Everything that makes it cool was adopted and incorporated into every other shooter that followed.
[0:15:12] <Dean_Inbetween> HEV suit at critcal health
[0:15:13] <%GeneralSCPatton> @heroicspiritavenger NO
[0:15:19] <frenchpooper> if u reading this, u cute b*tch
[0:15:24] <Hawkbone_> @heroicspiritavenger No, it used the Quake II engine as a base.
[0:15:27] <ThatGuyThere03> @heroicspiritavenger The engine was based off of Id Tech 2, Quake's engine
[0:15:28] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:15:30] <HawaiiAnthony> Everyone is on the black mesa hype I respect it
[0:15:32] <%RioGascar> Og half life was a HEAVILY modified quake engine titled “gold src”
[0:15:36] <Mothman742> @generalscpatton of course it was Kappa
[0:15:39] <MasterCrazy_RJ> Hey my dude how are you doing? :3
[0:15:39] <Dean_Inbetween> Im glad to show up at a starting episode
[0:15:45] <Grunkle_Dan_> THe youtube content has been great, feels very classic, a dying art.
[0:15:51] <unit24> @lotharrio true, but also a lot of what makes it cool was lost over the years as other trends took over
[0:15:51] <Hawkbone_> Wait, was GoldSource an evolution of the Quake 1 or 2 engine?
[0:15:55] <Prevot> Black Christmas went out for a smoke
[0:15:56] <Dean_Inbetween> Yes
[0:15:57] <@akuda_bar> I'm too white, I don't get it, what's black Christmas
[0:15:57] <andrei11dr> woolieMIRIN OR NOT
[0:16:00] <ThatGuyThere03> 2 I think
[0:16:01] <%RioGascar> i think quake 1
[0:16:02] <Solidnick18> it's very long
[0:16:06] <ragasquid> do it
[0:16:06] <%RioGascar> It was 1998
[0:16:06] <%TenWren> !uptime
[0:16:07] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 16 minutes and 8 seconds
[0:16:07] <+crimsonharvest> read the first novel, then play the 3rd game thats it
[0:16:11] <Dean_Inbetween> Gold source was a modified quake 2
[0:16:12] <centuronstar> Play Witcher 2 at least before 3
[0:16:13] <chronoxgp> witcher 3 has a recap
[0:16:14] <Dean_Inbetween> Yes
[0:16:16] <%OUTheTeam> just read dont play 1 and 2
[0:16:17] <niddron> I'm super down for a stream with that
[0:16:18] <startstoprepeat> there's very little that carries over between them
[0:16:19] <Agami23> just dont read the books. they are shit
[0:16:24] <GoodShotCam> talk to Pat, he'll tell u the first two are good but weird to play
[0:16:25] <niddron> nah you can skip those
[0:16:30] <FackinCrazy> Only 3 is ridiculously long
[0:16:31] <+crimsonharvest> You will save hundreds of hours of bullshit by reading at least the firstr book instead
[0:16:34] <HeavyNorse> Look up some lore vids about Witcher 1 and 2. Don't play them, they're not worth it, imo. But Witcher 3 definitely is!
[0:16:35] <@akuda_bar> they'd be terrible lps
[0:16:35] <+HDmexiqtioner> We talked about this Woolie. Witcher 3 fills you in hard.
[0:16:36] <andrei11dr> 1 is broken as FUCK
[0:16:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> No you can skip 1 & 2
[0:16:42] <chronoxgp> 3 is like mass effect with horses
[0:16:43] <%Irridium> Witcher 3's gonna need big fucking cuts if you do that
[0:16:52] <niddron> jumping in Witcher 3 is totally fine
[0:17:01] <SomersaultJustice> it's wolly time
[0:17:03] <+HDmexiqtioner> Mine was 300 with all DLC
[0:17:05] <startstoprepeat> with dlc my playthrough was 200 hours, don't do it
[0:17:05] <%RioGascar> it would persona levels of commitment
[0:17:07] <+crimsonharvest> just 3 is best, 1 and 2 are not fun times
[0:17:08] <+jiggy_snipe> not with KOTOR right now
[0:17:08] <+greenfall> stay healthy and safe both yous
[0:17:13] <heartlesshealer> yeah, it's a bit much at the moment when there's so much you'll wanna do being soon
[0:17:22] <Dean_Inbetween> How is the music in this remake chat? Is it as good as the original? FrankerZ FrankerZ FrankerZ
[0:17:25] <+slamzalid> Ahhh Woolie Dude :D <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
[0:17:26] <thetrashman_sc> 2 is good DansGame
[0:17:26] <xeros720> jerry's girth can't be underestimated
[0:17:26] <frenchpooper> u don't need toilet paper, all u need is a water bottle and a left hand
[0:17:27] <FackinCrazy> 3 with all the dlc is like 150+ hours
[0:17:29] <Superdandy96> Such girth woolieSHOOK_CL
[0:17:33] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I mean a test stream might not be too bad
[0:17:33] <mistersups> Sups!
[0:17:35] <Daxalog> Just play Gothic and pretend its Witcher 3
[0:17:38] <+slamzalid> Hi Other Dude!! :D <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
[0:17:44] <@akuda_bar> a honking adventure
[0:17:47] <jasonisgold79> So I just saw the name of the game. Is this for real? We really getting Half-Life on the Woolie channel?
[0:17:54] <NeakGX> that's more then one weeks worth of game
[0:17:55] <Mothman742> you could just do the story and the dlcs
[0:17:59] <jasonisgold79> Because if so, YEAH BOI!
[0:18:01] <heartlesshealer> Save it for when you have guest and ample time
[0:18:04] <pennykettle_> Too bad you dont know ANY witcher experts
[0:18:04] <FackinCrazy> What about Nioh 2 tho
[0:18:06] <DatAsuna> witcher expert? so, not pat
[0:18:06] <Superdandy96> No one told me there was gonna be Math
[0:18:07] <+R_BChe> witcher 3 gues LP guest: Henry Cavill
[0:18:15] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Doc1790
[0:18:17] <%GeneralSCPatton> You need a Little V for Witcher
[0:18:20] <andrei11dr> You can beat dark Souls in like 5 hours of you played it before
[0:18:22] <arkv01> hold on to your britches, modern warfare soon after black mesa LUL
[0:18:24] <HawaiiAnthony> Any animal crossing nostalgia/gameplay
[0:18:25] <+HDmexiqtioner> I can guide your hips Woolie. lol. Or at least do an LP of FIght Night Champion lol
[0:18:26] <Dean_Inbetween> chat how is the music in this remake? I haven’t heard it yet SeriousSloth
[0:18:29] <HeavyNorse> Silent Protag, the game.
[0:18:30] <Mothman742> @doc1790 NO YELLING
[0:18:32] <startstoprepeat> gordon freeman is a camera
[0:18:33] <@Solidus_113> Groudon Froman
[0:18:37] <+griffball13> as far as i'm concerned freemans mind is cannon
[0:18:42] <chronoxgp> i can beat four kinds in like 3 hours
[0:18:45] <Superdandy96> Little V’s into Witcher too?
[0:18:46] <Oleai> The oranges of Half-Life
[0:18:47] <+Pyroclase> Actually, HL1 was more important
[0:18:48] <+crimsonharvest> If you want to see some good RPing as Gordon watch Freeman's Mind by Ross Scott it's incredible
[0:18:48] <+stef5949> Gordon is whatever YOU chose for him to be
[0:18:49] <@akuda_bar> I just imagine him as acting exactly like he acts in Freeman's Mind
[0:18:50] <natebud> Gordon freeman is a man who's late and teases Snarks
[0:18:51] <Hawkbone_> Doomguy is a jock, Gordon is a nerd.
[0:18:51] <xeros720> ost on black mesa is real good
[0:18:51] <hntronium> Halflife 1 is better
[0:18:54] <+Pyroclase> it broke a lot more ground than HL2
[0:18:55] <+R_BChe> angriestpat: "half life 1 is better than 2"
[0:18:56] <cache_22> Has Woolie not played any Half-Life game before?
[0:18:57] <+Slimshazbot> It depends on the person, I know a lot of people that prefer 1
[0:19:01] <Dean_Inbetween> HE IS the most silent of protags
[0:19:02] <Solidnick18> love me some half life 1
[0:19:05] <andrei11dr> Im more into portal
[0:19:06] <+griffball13> FREEMANS MIND
[0:19:09] <LokimenD> Not really, but HL are cornerstone of PC games in general
[0:19:09] <@Solidus_113> Half Life 2 was bigger than 1 because the changes to Source engine that made physics HUGE
[0:19:11] <Daxalog> Half life 1 changed fps and killed other fps games in the womb.
[0:19:11] <Hawkbone_> Freemans Mind is still ongoing
[0:19:11] <+crimsonharvest> freeman's mind is a pro watch
[0:19:13] <WarKamex> freemans mind is great
[0:19:14] <Dr_Mooose> that is such a good series
[0:19:14] <valriot> HL1 is better LUL
[0:19:14] <ThatGuyThere03> that's still going on
[0:19:15] <%RioGascar> i am so curious on woolies opinions on this series
[0:19:16] <+Slimshazbot> 1 and 2 are really different experiences tbh
[0:19:17] <niddron> Freeman's thots
[0:19:20] <Man_in_the_Red> Freeman's mind is still going on
[0:19:21] <jasonisgold79> Also, hello Woolie. Been watching the DOOM LP and loving it. We may disagree on somethings but so long as you remain a chill nice dude, you're alright by me.
[0:19:24] <fruit_pie_the_magician> HL2 is better.....but for reasons im not sure I understand
[0:19:25] <Slimeking_Mike> Ross Scottr is a legend
[0:19:28] <ScreamLord> @WoolieVersus Freeman's Mind is awesome dude
[0:19:29] <MassConnect> that headcrab over ther?
[0:19:31] <%GeneralSCPatton> Freeman's Mind is a national treasure
[0:19:33] <Dean_Inbetween> No character implications or inferring AT ALL he is a complete cardboard box
[0:19:33] <hntronium> Halflife 2 is about a physics showcase that hasn't aged as well as 1
[0:19:40] <BlueMoonBlues> One thing is certain, Woolie will find the enemy force in HL2 waaay more interesting thatn in HL1
[0:19:42] <MasterCrazy_RJ> @akuda_bar Ross Scott's Gordon is CANNON in my eyes.
[0:19:45] <hntronium> VORE
[0:19:45] <+robobeau> Besides Minh is mostly carbs
[0:19:46] <andrei11dr> 1 and 2 are very different
[0:19:47] <@akuda_bar> he's got the vore fetish
[0:19:49] <%allups> with witcher i dropped off due to being overwhelmed and being lost
[0:19:50] <arkv01> no please no cannibalism on woolievs BibleThump
[0:19:54] <heartlesshealer> minh's a thin boi
[0:19:58] <jasonisgold79> Also, 1st time catching one of these live. :D
[0:19:59] <FrankysDream> hell yeah half life
[0:20:01] <Dean_Inbetween> I would say 1 is still a more revolutionary game
[0:20:10] <HawaiiAnthony> 4 days worth of meat KappaPride
[0:20:10] <xeros720> hl2 was incredible when it came out, but it's old now
[0:20:10] <@Moobot> Easy with the emojis @HeavyNorse
[0:20:12] <Hawkbone_> Minh has way too much sodium, very unhealthy
[0:20:12] <shnek999> Any plans on Arkham Asylum ?
[0:20:12] <natebud> 1 has better AI than Black Mesa
[0:20:13] <hntronium> WoolieVoresus
[0:20:14] <arkv01> minh's survival instinct would be too strong, he'd git woolie first and consume him slowly
[0:20:16] <andrei11dr> Now Woolie is trying to become Kirby
[0:20:21] <jasonisgold79> How did you & LittleV meet Woolie?

[0:22:12] <+HotBloodedHero> Updated History lane
[0:22:14] <Mothman742> @woolieversus have either of you played any half lifes?

[0:22:14] <%RioGascar> im curious to see this game as you guys see it as well
[0:22:15] <hntronium> *late
[0:22:20] <rosemon5001> @arkv01 in estonia its funny mostly the females buy the food stuff but when i went shopping i saw mostly males buying pure vodka lol
[0:22:29] <jasonisgold79> Oh you about to look up a loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooot of shit Reggie.
[0:22:29] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1237401882802429957
[0:22:32] <heartlesshealer> awesome
[0:22:34] <LeaIsChill> This is a weird first Half Life exposure
[0:22:36] <+MaddyCaddy> Cool
[0:22:39] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus adjust the game's video source, it doesn't fill the stream borders
[0:22:46] <jasonisgold79> Like there is soo much history & lore.
[0:22:48] <LokimenD> But do you know about FULL-LIFE CONSEQUENCES?
[0:22:48] <+TopTieramisu> @hntronium china ate the vaccine?
[0:22:49] <chronoxgp> half life more like empty life, amirite?
[0:22:50] <Mothman742> ooooh blind
[0:22:53] <+tuchpi> too bad Woolie isn't using his nightmare fps setup :(
[0:22:58] <RyuuAoi> Reggie, make Woolie play SA2B.
[0:22:59] <$Noponiz> reggie is cute!
[0:22:59] <andrei11dr> Has Woolie played Portal?
[0:23:02] <heartlesshealer> Chat, no one advise about enemies unless they get stuck ;)
[0:23:04] <frenchpooper> i'm doing a Tinder speedrun no death
[0:23:15] <+HDmexiqtioner> Have you done Fight Night Champion's Campaign Woolie?
[0:23:16] <LeaIsChill> Is it gonna be 100% too?
[0:23:21] <%RioGascar> @woolieversus has woolie or you played portal or left 4 dead? Or any valve games?
[0:23:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> @heartlesshealer What about wrong advice?
[0:23:26] <pennykettle_> i changed my tinder location to pyongyang and there was 1 chick
[0:23:26] <jasonisgold79> @RyuuAoi I'd rather not have an LP where it's just constantly shitting on Sonic IMO.
[0:23:26] <RyuuAoi> Reggie, let that fro grow! I can dig it!
[0:23:26] <hntronium> @TopTieramisu Mistype, but the Chinese are way ahead in making the vaccine. Something about them being at stage 3, whatever that means
[0:23:27] <chronoxgp> invert your controls whoolie
[0:23:28] <casualxxx> stuff copied - check
[0:23:29] <chronoxgp> all of them
[0:23:29] <awalr> PogChamp more fps
[0:23:30] <niddron> @frenchpooper I got banned
[0:23:35] <unit24> @WoolieVersus be sure to turn down the music volume a bit, it's really loud and overpowering by default
[0:23:38] <Rangenade> would it be fair to say that black mesa is the re2remake of hl1? makes a bunch of changes but the original is still worth playing?
[0:23:39] <+pectusumbra> wait is this salt party?
[0:23:39] <DeathByPoke7> has anyone made a half life morgan freeman mod
[0:23:42] <natebud> @heartlesshealer the marines can't shoot you if you stand still at certain distances.
[0:23:43] <Superdandy96> Reggie, you got that half-life facts ready?
[0:23:46] <Man_in_the_Red> @rangenade yes
[0:23:46] <$GoogleyGareth> Oh hey they fancied the menu up
[0:23:47] <frenchpooper> @niddron noob shit
[0:23:48] <RyuuAoi> @jasonisgold79 THEY WOULD NOT Keepo
[0:23:48] <awalr> how long until woolievs is a boomershooter channel
[0:23:49] <LeaIsChill> Resolution bad
[0:23:50] <casualxxx> stuff put in - check
[0:23:52] <jasonisgold79> So this is gonna be your 1st exposure to HL1 yes?
[0:23:55] <+Pyroclase> at the top
[0:23:57] <@akuda_bar> @pectusumbra nope, lps are behind so we're doing black Mesa instead
[0:23:58] <+TopTieramisu> @hntronium curious how they'll handle sharing the vaccine with the rest of the world
[0:23:59] <turbofolk> BLACCCKKK MESSSSSAA!
[0:23:59] <@Solidus_113> resolution on the top
[0:24:00] <heartlesshealer> @CommanderSqueaks If it's not real, it's not advice ;p
[0:24:00] <Hawkbone_> Field of view only goes to 90? DansGame
[0:24:03] <mistersups> @WoolieVersus what is your history with the various Valve games? Portal, Left 4 Dead and such.
[0:24:03] <$GoogleyGareth> 90 max LUL
[0:24:10] <@Solidus_113> 1080p
[0:24:11] <xeros720> looking forward to other boomer shooters
[0:24:16] <Man_in_the_Red> Gold Source original is still great, but avoid the borked Gear box source version
[0:24:17] <dukenux> Damn, when did the stream start?
[0:24:17] <majima666> 240p
[0:24:19] <awalr> give me 120 FOV or give me death
[0:24:20] <hntronium> 800x600
[0:24:23] <$GoogleyGareth> eyyy
[0:24:24] <niddron> @frenchpooper strength build wasn't the way to go
[0:24:27] <chronoxgp> VSYNC on
[0:24:28] <andrei11dr> FRAMEZZZZZ
[0:24:28] <@akuda_bar> yay
[0:24:29] <+Wool> does Woolie sound congested
[0:24:29] <hntronium> Better
[0:24:30] <%Feifong_wong> Is this the first stream of this?
[0:24:31] <+HDmexiqtioner> ENHANCE
[0:24:32] <xeros720> booters?
[0:24:33] <HeavyNorse> Beautiful.

[0:27:41] <casualxxx> corona research facility
[0:27:42] <+MaddyCaddy> It's a fun game
[0:27:45] <Agami23> ah yes, with this fan game
[0:27:48] <natebud> Looks like closed captioning is already on @HeavyNorse
[0:27:49] <RyuuAoi> Woolie gonna beat it TONIGHT
[0:27:51] <majima666> not sure if i completed the og half life. but i did do blueshift
[0:27:53] <VJdarkworld> impulse_101
[0:27:55] <xeros720> a lot of it was when they came out
[0:27:57] <turbofolk> Lets find out about BROKEN PROMISES
[0:28:00] <HeavyNorse> @natebud Oh good. ^^
[0:28:03] <+HDmexiqtioner> How quick is this game to beat?
[0:28:04] <chronoxgp> I tried playing it earlier, rainbowsix had an update
[0:28:04] <majima666> i was watching pat-kun stream this the other day
[0:28:05] <jasonisgold79> @WoolieVersus For the record, this is a fan remake. It's really good imo, but it's not official.
[0:28:06] <+croxeye> OH HELLO
[0:28:12] <%RioGascar> so only half life 1
[0:28:13] <dukenux> @atravelbee yeah, it sucks. im not old, but still in a risk group
[0:28:15] <+croxeye> how bout this, woolie VS half-life
[0:28:15] <heartlesshealer> shattered memories?
[0:28:19] <Hawkbone_> Half-Life was really big too. It was arguably even more important than 2.
[0:28:23] <andrei11dr> It's very ,VERY ,important game
[0:28:23] <+SpcOpsBear> sv_cheats 0
[0:28:31] <petwisk> the start is kind of slow but when shit gets on It a GETS ON
[0:28:32] <Solidnick18> Man half life 3 such a shame
[0:28:33] <heartlesshealer> Subtitles are... ehhh for this game. Not sure why, but there it is
[0:28:35] <Man_in_the_Red> @hdmexiqtioner its a good 12 hours ish, but you'll feel the compulsion to replay it every blue moon
[0:28:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> FAN-MADE REMAKE, OFFICIALLY ENDORSED
[0:28:39] <arkv01> @dukenux I didn't know we had fans in that age range, cool
[0:28:39] <hntronium> Is crouch jump on?
[0:28:39] <xeros720> both half lifes were years ahead of other titles in the same timeframe
[0:28:42] <RyuuAoi> Black Table Research Facility
[0:28:42] <@Solidus_113> TURN OFF AUTO CROUCH JUMP
[0:28:45] <+tuchpi> hl1 put it on the map
[0:28:45] <+crimsonharvest> its fun to watch @WoolieVersus get hype at stuff that was hype then and is still hype now
[0:28:45] <HeavyNorse> What makes this different to the official games? What is done different?
[0:28:45] <KnivesEve> Subs are borked
[0:28:46] <+OmegaWeltall> oh boy Kappa
[0:28:46] <hntronium> Turn off crouch jump cowards
[0:28:46] <+croxeye> IMO Half-life still stands up on it's own terms tbh
[0:28:49] <AmericanaRed> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead psaHoldon
[0:28:49] <+MaddyCaddy> Might want to turn off auto crouch jump
[0:28:50] <thetrashman_sc> Turn off auto crouch jump
[0:28:50] <+jiggy_snipe> is Woolie on 4k?
[0:28:51] <VJdarkworld> half life 3 is coming out this month
[0:28:52] <SomersaultJustice> WOOSH
[0:28:53] <+OmegaWeltall> he didnt see Pat's stream LUL
[0:28:57] <Man_in_the_Red> @vjdarkworld LUL
[0:28:57] <andrei11dr> Oh man
[0:28:59] <Hawkbone_> @HeavyNorse Its a remake.
[0:29:00] <atravelbee> @dukenux yeah, ~vulnerable~ people
[0:29:04] <dukenux> @arkv01 LUL nah, its just blood pressure + kidney combo
[0:29:06] <+prime_name> Kinect? in 2020?
[0:29:06] <+jiggy_snipe> Subs don't scale to resolution
[0:29:07] <Zeemod155> Subtitles are pretty suseless
[0:29:12] <+HeavyMetalIceCream> beware, those subs are small
[0:29:13] <arkv01> @dukenux oh LUL
[0:29:13] <natebud> @HeavyNorse Made by a mod team, they change a lot of little things.
[0:29:13] <%JuliusGemstone> 'PLEASE MOOD THE KINECT REGGIE"
[0:29:15] <jasonisgold79> LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOO!
[0:29:16] <niddron> @solidus_113 auto what?! how dare they! I suffered so why shouldn't they?!
[0:29:17] <UnfilteredComic> @WoolieVersus As a heads up, the subtitles SIZE scales based on RESOLUTION, so it might be small text
[0:29:17] <Man_in_the_Red> subtitles are useless in 4K
[0:29:18] <+croxeye> @HeavyNorse it's a mostly 1:1 remake of the Black mesa portion, slight differnces, but a much expanded Xen
[0:29:21] <HeavyNorse> @Hawkbone_ So they just upped the graphics?
[0:29:22] <OToole42> @WoolieVersus so happy to see you playing this, used to speedrun HL1 and Blue Shift
[0:29:25] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @RyuuAoi
[0:29:28] <KnivesEve> i dont think subs are scaled correctly
[0:29:30] <SomersaultJustice> like SRB?
[0:29:31] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:29:35] <HeavyNorse> @croxeye Ah alright. ^^
[0:29:36] <@Solidus_113> 7 years of work
[0:29:40] <dukenux> And... they... did it
[0:29:44] <jasonisgold79> Can't hear it!!!!!
[0:29:45] <unit24> can't hear the game
[0:29:46] <%Ipsenscastle> I don't think a person can go back and play HL for the first time now, everything that was special about it proliferated into every other FPS of the past 20 years
[0:29:47] <awalr> fusion dance
[0:29:48] <TwinBat> audio too low
[0:29:49] <majima666> streets of rage also has a fucking baller fan made remake
[0:29:49] <Andu_in> That's rad
[0:29:51] <andrei11dr> They FUSION HA this bich
[0:29:52] <Hawkbone_> 7

[0:29:53] <@Solidus_113> there's not a lot of audio
[0:29:53] <+OmegaWeltall> when fans to a better job than professionals LUL
[0:29:53] <thetrashman_sc> turn off auto crouch jump in the settings
[0:29:54] <jasonisgold79> Pause, audio is dead.
[0:29:55] <+crimsonharvest> look around this is a tour as much as a commute
[0:29:57] <Solidnick18> then valve was like this is cool
[0:29:57] <+HDmexiqtioner> And they followed WOolie's advice and SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT IT
[0:29:59] <UnfilteredComic> ok that size is ok
[0:30:00] <Man_in_the_Red> took em a while but they killed it i'd say
[0:30:01] <pennykettle_> this sequence was legendaey in 98
[0:30:02] <dukenux> it was still a great game back then tho
[0:30:03] <Hawkbone_> Audio is fine
[0:30:03] <+Bluemanzee> Amazed they were able to continue work on it for that long
[0:30:04] <hntronium> Oh these subs are better than it was for pat
[0:30:06] <jasonisgold79> Okay we can hear it a little bit, but turn it up
[0:30:11] <jasonisgold79> Oh there was Barney!
[0:30:13] <LokimenD> That's a STRONG name
[0:30:14] <+Pyroclase> @HDmexiqtioner actually they were very open about it the whole time, Valve was cool with the remake
[0:30:16] <niddron> know one of the main contributers to this project, cool guy, works on Star citizen now.
[0:30:19] <Calern> got at the part with the backfliping ninjas in the room with all the containers, that game has a very erratic difficulty curve sometimes
[0:30:21] <Hawkbone_> Valve is like, 50% old fans nowadays
[0:30:22] <KnivesEve> oh i guess subs are fine
[0:30:23] <Man_in_the_Red> Hunt down the Freeman Kappa
[0:30:23] <HeavyNorse> Game audio is a bit low.
[0:30:24] <+HDmexiqtioner> @Pyroclase good guy valve
[0:30:26] <$GoogleyGareth> Yeah half their games are from modders and bought out.
[0:30:28] <RyuuAoi> Let him learn about the crouch jump. Let him GET FUCKED
[0:30:29] <Agami23> just like hunt down the freeman
[0:30:31] <awalr> pat was playing at 4k

[0:31:51] <NaturalGear> @Calern yes, as mods
[0:31:52] <RyuuAoi> Read the subs you chucks!
[0:31:53] <jasonisgold79> I love Portal.
[0:31:56] <@Solidus_113> Go find someone else to help you
[0:31:56] <+Doc1790> Half Life starts with Castlevania: Symphony of The Night
[0:31:58] <mankeymania> pat stream did this too
[0:31:59] <Streetshark_> yooooooo
[0:32:00] <%Parapattern> Aperture Science is so much cooler than Black Mesa
[0:32:00] <niddron> yeah Woolie!
[0:32:01] <@Solidus_113> maybe black mesa
[0:32:04] <DSD24> Oh cool Woolie is playing Black Mesa
[0:32:05] <Calern> sweet
[0:32:05] <$GoogleyGareth> @allups Yeah they actually had some trust issues signing things off again after that whole debacle.
[0:32:05] <dukenux> They stole Aperture's research, and Cave HATES them
[0:32:08] <pennykettle_> aperture science is way more evil but black mesa fucked the earth
[0:32:13] <%Sogeki_Dan> I dunno why I thought this would look better, maybe cause it took so long for it to come out.
[0:32:16] <Streetshark_> woolie playing black mesa??
[0:32:17] <worldbrand> oh shit i didnt know woolie was doing this hell yeah
[0:32:21] <+HDmexiqtioner> Something about trains being elevators freaks me out
[0:32:22] <@Solidus_113> Reggie research did it
[0:32:23] <Streetshark_> i fucks wit dis
[0:32:24] <+croxeye> Black mesa is less cartoonishly evil than aperture science, but Black Mesa also has pools of acid for some reason lol
[0:32:24] <LokimenD> Black Mesa is the outright evil version of APerture
[0:32:25] <RyuuAoi> @streetshark_ No
[0:32:26] <Hawkbone_> One of Aperture's creations is, or was going to be at least, one of the most important parts of Half-Life's story.
[0:32:29] <chronoxgp> black mesa is where it's located
[0:32:32] <natebud> @HDmexiqtioner as it should
[0:32:38] <Man_in_the_Red> @lokimend its more negligent
[0:32:38] <DSD24> Freeman's running late
[0:32:39] <chronoxgp> a mesa is a lone plateu in the flat desert
[0:32:45] <jasonisgold79> @WoolieVersus Don't be afraid to take your time & explore areas in this game. It's a very atmospheric game and does reward exploration a bit.
[0:32:45] <@Solidus_113> Portal 2 has the references
[0:32:49] <%superc37> with aperature being the stupid version of apature
[0:32:49] <Streetshark_> the borealis?
[0:32:50] <%allups> @GoogleyGareth I no nothing about the drama surrounding it tbh
[0:32:51] <pennykettle_> 👀
[0:32:51] <atravelbee> @HDmexiqtioner Elvevators give me the willies period
[0:32:51] <chronoxgp> or a flat pyramid with no cone
[0:32:53] <+htt0r1hnz0> What's the ship The Aurora got to do with this universe?
[0:32:55] <+Pyroclase> the audio is still really loud
[0:33:03] <dukenux> @WoolieVersus there's an Easter Egg in Portal 2 that relates to HL2
[0:33:04] <Mvrdok_> A mesa is a table in spanish
[0:33:04] <RyuuAoi> Audio too low
[0:33:05] <natebud> Music in this game is great though
[0:33:10] <Zeemod155> Given enough time Aperature could have fucked humanity even harder than BM
[0:33:10] <$Noponiz> the art is pretty nice. It isnt like insane, but really sharp
[0:33:11] <+jkobe34> Is anyone else seeing screen tearing?
[0:33:13] <niddron> audio is fine
[0:33:14] <Hawkbone_> Audio is a little too high
[0:33:17] <@Solidus_113> Vsync is off
[0:33:19] <RyuuAoi> TURN UP AUDIO
[0:33:23] <CALLthaDoctah> Is this cat playing this with a controller NotLikeThis
[0:33:23] <dukenux> yeah, Borealis dry dock
[0:33:25] <mass1997> audio is fine
[0:33:25] <Slimeking_Mike> AURORA BORALIS? In this part of the country, at this time of day, localised ENTIRELY within your Drydock?
[0:33:26] <AmericanaRed> MORE AUDIO
[0:33:27] <+Baekon01> Cant believe Freemans Mind finally got a game
[0:33:27] <rubbishbinge> Audio is fine
[0:33:29] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> audio is fine
[0:33:30] <%Ipsenscastle> I appreciate that Reggie does his research
[0:33:31] <artificiallynatural> less cheese more macaroni
[0:33:31] <+tuchpi> GOOD AUDIO
[0:33:32] <+thackattack00> audio is good
[0:33:33] <Streetshark_> yes
[0:33:33] <KnivesEve> audio sounds fine
[0:33:36] <%Feifong_wong> Audio is good
[0:33:38] <DSD24> Freeman's Mind is amazing
[0:33:41] <+Qsmash_> Audio is too loud but also too low
[0:33:42] <thetrashman_sc> freeman's mind is so fuckin good
[0:33:44] <+ArtemisCroc> I think I hate this chat
[0:33:45] <arkv01> oh man I remember this sequence well, fucked me up with motion sickness HARD like 20 years ago
[0:33:46] <NeakGX> I HAVE NO OPINIONS ON THE AUDIO
[0:33:51] <natebud> Music is just really loud in this game by default.
[0:33:51] <Zeemod155> Headphones audio is good
[0:33:51] <AmericanaRed> COMPOSER KILLIN IT
[0:33:53] <Hawkbone_> When the action starts we'll barely be able to hear Woolie
[0:33:56] <MassConnect> chat is too looud
[0:33:57] <NeonBleu> about that vsync tho
[0:34:01] <dukenux> i can't remember, do you see G-man on a tram in this?
[0:34:02] <Hawkbone_> Perfect
[0:34:03] <+htt0r1hnz0> Adrian's Mind is an awesome "sequel" too
[0:34:04] <+croxeye> your voices are a bit too low I think
[0:34:05] <+Slimshazbot> Actually Half Life is quite different structure-wise from other old-school FPSes, no key hunting or anything
[0:34:07] <heartlesshealer> L o a d i n g
[0:34:08] <niddron> audio is producing waves in the air, please stop.
[0:34:10] <VJdarkworld> LOADING
[0:34:12] <awalr> audio is too medium

[0:34:16] <Solidnick18> loading
[0:34:22] <+crimsonharvest> is japanese
[0:34:23] <andrei11dr> When did HL 1 came out again?
[0:34:23] <@Solidus_113> NOTHING GETS IN OR OUT
[0:34:25] <DSD24> @htt0r1hnz0 Shepard's Mind was pretty good too I agree
[0:34:29] <atravelbee> had to turn FFZ compressor off sad now
[0:34:30] <Zebroneath> Is this a quick look or a playthrough?
[0:34:30] <Streetshark_> @dukenux you do
[0:34:36] <jasonisgold79> @WoolieVersus If you haven't seen Freemans Mind, it's a show home to such quotes as "I've brushed with death so often, I should be giving him high-fives as I past."
[0:34:37] <SuperKirby24> wew wut this
[0:34:39] <$GoogleyGareth> He's a young lad
[0:34:41] <%generalve> WAIT WHATY ?
[0:34:42] <+mankeyfigh> So what about salt party?
[0:34:43] <%RioGascar> Valve will HIRE you if you make fans stuff
[0:34:45] <Toxicjok3r1209> lookin at you nintendo
[0:34:48] <arkv01> gordon is a spry young age of 17

[0:34:52] <UnfilteredComic> yea gordon is young
[0:34:53] <dukenux> fresh doctor
[0:34:54] <Hawkbone_> Half-Life 1 originally came out in 1998
[0:34:56] <pennykettle_> Gordon is 27 forever
[0:34:59] <@Solidus_113> Gordon is just some nerd
[0:35:00] <Slimeking_Mike> BIG nerd
[0:35:01] <ScreamLord> "We're physicists!"
[0:35:02] <%generalve> Woolie brocading his horizons even more god damn
[0:35:08] <CrimsonSilver4> Freeman's Mind is still ongoing with Half-Life 2.
[0:35:10] <Streetshark_> shes a big boy now
[0:35:11] <Zeemod155> Man I'm older than Gordan now
[0:35:20] <DSD24> @jasonisgold79 Another quote is "I have to blow everything up! its the only way to prove I'm not crazy!"
[0:35:22] <VJdarkworld> @RioGascar yup, thats why black mesa took so long too. all the modders kept getting hired
[0:35:22] <MasterCrazy_RJ> Gordon is a young boy. he's only 27 during this whole shit. Still blows my mind he's not that old.
[0:35:22] <HeavyNorse> Some serious sciencing happening here.
[0:35:23] <thetrashman_sc> She blinded me with science
[0:35:24] <$GoogleyGareth> Song Kreygasm
[0:35:25] <+tuchpi> 27 what?
[0:35:26] <dukenux> He's gonna put his MIT education to good use in these games Kappa
[0:35:27] <thetrashman_sc> SCIENCE
[0:35:29] <+crimsonharvest> does 'materials handling' mean 'garbage dumping'
[0:35:35] <SuperKirby24> never trust no science man Kappa
[0:35:35] <Calern> and yet the only science thing he does is push a cart into a laser
[0:35:38] <pennykettle_> ROBO
[0:35:40] <RyuuAoi> Gordon got the Covid
[0:35:42] <@Solidus_113> ROBO BOY

[0:35:47] <dukenux> Cool, Opposing Force robo
[0:35:48] <thetrashman_sc> ROBT
[0:35:48] <%RioGascar> its the corporate version of waste dumping yes
[0:35:49] <Man_in_the_Red> @crimsonharvest it means moving the giant crystal to focus a laser
[0:35:52] <Zeemod155> PhD in BLASTING ALIENS AND PARKOUR
[0:35:52] <Mvrdok_> Time to send my resume
[0:35:53] <lloyddboy> you NEVER INTERACT with cool bot and that makes me sad
[0:35:55] <arkv01> yo thassum coolass robutts
[0:35:55] <LokimenD> If you count shooting lazers at rocks and seeing what happens science
[0:35:57] <%RioGascar> It is a full LP
[0:35:57] <zhu000> just like my old vid game
[0:35:57] <jasonisgold79> Yeah this muthafucker is a scientist and saves the world at 27. A man 6 years older than me can save the world.
[0:35:57] <Streetshark_> xen is fucking beautiful
[0:35:58] <natebud> There's that robot that never shows up again in this game.
[0:36:00] <arkv01> lemme spook that booty
[0:36:01] <+crimsonharvest> no no man in red that's research associate
[0:36:03] <unit24> okay let's be real how many freeman's mind quotes will be in the chat
[0:36:10] <DSD24> @unit24 All of them
[0:36:12] <+crimsonharvest> all of them
[0:36:14] <%RioGascar> well considering pats stream
[0:36:15] <Sol_Install> this feels a bit DOOM 3, maybe it just me
[0:36:17] <%RioGascar> A lot
[0:36:18] <ScreamLord> @WoolieVersus It's basically an super villain hide out
[0:36:21] <Man_in_the_Red> @unit24 not enough
[0:36:21] <thetrashman_sc> you're in the barrel LUL
[0:36:21] <arkv01> get IN there gord
[0:36:22] <VJdarkworld> atmosphere building PogChamp
[0:36:23] <Hawkbone_> There's a really cool video that shows an entire map of the facility with markers showing where the 3 protags are during the event.
[0:36:26] <zhu000> no clip
[0:36:26] <NeakGX> spinoff game where you play as that robot
[0:36:27] <natebud> Bye robot, see you in Opposing Force
[0:36:27] <Agami23> sadly it doesen't fit map wise. some areas realistically would be inside each other. but its pretty close
[0:36:27] <TomFrank> this is the part where you fall down
[0:36:28] <+htt0r1hnz0> @unit24 yes
[0:36:30] <%linSP> Technically freeman helped fuck the world thanks to science
[0:36:30] <@Solidus_113> It's a massive map, and it's 100% contiguous
[0:36:36] <@Solidus_113> everything connects
[0:36:37] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[0:36:37] <%RioGascar> it was insane back in 1998
[0:36:39] <+mars_driver> @WoolieVersus Welcome to the fold of classic FPS. You gotta check out Blood at some point, too!
[0:36:42] <dukenux> although there should be option to skip it on future replays imho
[0:36:46] <arkv01> thanks you moobot, the restoration mod is amazing
[0:36:46] <%generalve> generalve subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 2 month streak! so happy your expanding more. do you think woolie vs Kingdom hearts will ever happen ? like naruto there are a lot of cool moments and boss fights in the 2nd game that i would love to see your reaction on
[0:36:47] <thetrashman_sc> thanks moobot LUL
[0:36:49] <%RioGascar> cause every game was like YOUR A SOLDIER OR DEMON SLAYER
[0:36:49] <YourOpinionSucks> gman
[0:36:50] <CrimsonSilver4> A good thing about the trains section is that it's its own chapter, so if you want to skip it straight into the action you can. Otherwise you can sit for a couple of minutes and appreciate it.
[0:36:50] <+croxeye> The G-man!
[0:36:50] <natebud> left!
[0:36:51] <YourOpinionSucks> GMAN
[0:36:52] <jasonisgold79> Oh yeah, Black Mesa is huge. And Aperture Labs is bigger I think. I'm sure it goes down more.
[0:36:54] <VJdarkworld> Black Mesa: Restoration Mod PogChamp
[0:36:59] <$GoogleyGareth> Look at how safe we are!
[0:37:01] <%RioGascar> this game? You are a scientist going to your job LATE
[0:37:02] <Haarute> IT'S FINE.
[0:37:02] <zayasu> WutFace
[0:37:02] <AmericanaRed> YIKERS
[0:37:03] <CursedNobleman> its FIIINE
[0:37:03] <pennykettle_> LUL pre-disaster disaster
[0:37:03] <thetrashman_sc> LUL
[0:37:05] <$GoogleyGareth> Nothing can go wrong!
[0:37:06] <Zeemod155> Everything is fine
[0:37:07] <dukenux> Mtn Dew vats
[0:37:08] <Solidnick18> hmm
[0:37:08] <$GoogleyGareth> NOTHING
[0:37:08] <ScreamLord> Who spilled the gadorade?
[0:37:08] <Calern> the later part outside on the surface make it look so fucking huge
[0:37:09] <Streetshark_> That looks safe
[0:37:09] <heartlesshealer> =)
[0:37:10] <+Bluemanzee> Nothing to see here :)
[0:37:10] <+crimsonharvest> lol you work next door to a spill
[0:37:12] <arkv01> ScaredyCat uh oh
[0:37:13] <jasonisgold79> Woolie, the man in the suit.
[0:37:15] <andrei11dr> HES FINE Kappa
[0:37:18] <casualxxx> just a little radiation its fine SeemsGood
[0:37:19] <natebud> The original stopped you here so you had to see gman. It's fine
[0:37:23] <dukenux> They're gonna be fine Kappa
[0:37:27] <NeonBleu> there probably not stuck now Kappa
[0:37:27] <Haarute> gordon saw that and went "not my problem"
[0:37:27] <heartlesshealer> loading
[0:37:28] <AmericanaRed> psaSmug ITS FINE
[0:37:28] <arkv01> it's fine, we're born to die
[0:37:30] <jasonisgold79> Wach out for a blue man in a suit. Just a heads up.
[0:37:32] <LokimenD> So, when's Woolie gonna stream some STALKER with all the fps?
[0:37:33] <alexandrecau> see here this guy saying everything fine
[0:37:33] <Solidnick18> everything is gonna be just fine
[0:37:33] <Streetshark_> dont yall have pools of radiation
[0:37:33] <dukenux> ohai Barney
[0:37:34] <awalr> @dukenux there's a chapter select so you can skip tram ride
[0:37:35] <%itmegwimble> Cheer500 YO HALF LIFE!!! Everything HL related is my shit and I'm hype y'all are doing this. In case you didn't know, HL lore (moreso HL2 lore) is actually fucking SICK and I'd highly recommend looking into it. Shit has some of the most dire and grim views on the nature of reality and humanity''s future outside of 40k or something. Shit's that bad. Also, fun fact: Headcrab victims are 100% conscious and are aware they're being meat-puppeted and are falling apart. Have fun! Luv you guys
[0:37:36] <ScreamLord> Don't drink the water
[0:37:38] <%RioGascar> Only 3.4 rotgen
[0:37:39] <Hawkbone_> Hi Barney!
[0:37:40] <TakesGuts> this screen tearing tho
[0:37:41] <@Solidus_113> yes
[0:37:41] <+crimsonharvest> the location of the loads was pretty well preserved
[0:37:42] <$GoogleyGareth> yep
[0:37:42] <NeakGX> that's just the place where thtey make glow-in-the-dark GAK
[0:37:42] <dukenux> It's more a case of an old engine
[0:37:44] <niddron> it fine... actually it super isn't but let's not think about it
[0:37:45] <+stef5949> I am already prepared for them to miss like 90% of G-man appearances
[0:37:45] <%generalve> yes
[0:37:45] <arkv01> this game has fucking dota beeps LUL
[0:37:45] <Zeemod155> Could be worse, could be a Covid outbreak Kappa
[0:37:49] <NaturalGear> yeah it's a source thing
[0:37:50] <UnfilteredComic> loading times are much faster thankfully
[0:37:55] <%RioGascar> source has lots of loading
[0:37:57] <brunoberserk> look a barney
[0:37:57] <Man_in_the_Red> they wanted to preserve the load points
[0:38:00] <HeavyNorse> Sauce engine lotsa loads.
[0:38:06] <%RioGascar> Source 2 apparently fixs it
[0:38:06] <pennykettle_> I really like source loading
[0:38:08] <jasonisgold79> The Source Engine is fine, but it has its flaws.
[0:38:09] <%CrimsonCore90> Damn just starting too let's go! woolieYE woolieYE
[0:38:09] <Streetshark_> man
[0:38:10] <worldbrand> source engine is only... ... oh, 16 years old...
[0:38:14] <natebud> Look at that joke Woolie doesn't get
[0:38:14] <+croxeye> back in gold source BB
[0:38:19] <andrei11dr> Im sure they won't get bodied horrored or something Kappa
[0:38:25] <hntronium> SELLOUT
[0:38:29] <%RioGascar> the old old engine
[0:38:29] <$GoogleyGareth> Yep
[0:38:30] <pennykettle_> LUL wait is that in the original
[0:38:32] <%RioGascar> gold source
[0:38:32] <@Solidus_113> Pretty much everything is based on the Quake IDTech engine
[0:38:33] <thetrashman_sc> LUL
[0:38:34] <Solidnick18> Sell out
[0:38:37] <pennykettle_> L O L
[0:38:38] <+Slimshazbot> He ACTUALLY did
[0:38:38] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> in beta
[0:38:38] <Streetshark_> does anybody feel scp was inspired by HL
[0:38:39] <CursedNobleman> PUSH BUTTON
[0:38:40] <masterfire23> source 2 releases with half-life alyx PogChamp
[0:38:41] <Torgue_1> @pennykettle_ Nope
[0:38:42] <jasonisgold79> Another thing about this is the VA is pretty good. Like they got a lot of pretty good VAs for some of the characters.
[0:38:42] <heartlesshealer> characterization exists!
[0:38:46] <%RioGascar> the source engine was based on HEAVILY modified havek engine
[0:38:46] <+stef5949> The original concept art had
[0:38:47] <Zebroneath> what a wannabe hipster
[0:38:48] <cache_22> Gordan probably had a Jedi rattail when he was younger.
[0:38:51] <niddron> sold out
[0:38:51] <Hawkbone_> HL1 was based on ID Tech 2, specifically.
[0:38:54] <Chatterbox1991> YUPPIE FREEMAN
[0:38:55] <+croxeye> go behind the desk and push the alarm
[0:38:55] <lloyddboy> yall see sexy high-res gordon?
[0:38:57] <+croxeye> DO IT
[0:38:58] <jasonisgold79> That's a ref to one of Gordons original models.
[0:39:00] <LokimenD> @heartlesshealer just not for Gordon
[0:39:01] <+Bearborg> you can fuck with this guy's stuff
[0:39:03] <unit24> @WoolieVersus okay now sound the alarm under the front desk
[0:39:05] <UnfilteredComic> test chamberrrrr
[0:39:06] <+theotherkristian> Now I promise I won't spam... But I'm gonna recommend Gears of War for an LP possibilty when I tune in for Woolzatron.
[0:39:06] <VJdarkworld> the Tessttttt CHammberrr
[0:39:06] <FuqBoiSlim> It's called a Warrior's Wolf Tail

[0:39:15] <DSD24> Look you have to reboot it
[0:39:17] <Hawkbone_> Thow shit at his face!

[0:39:21] <arkv01> nerd shaming D:
[0:39:21] <dukenux> They're wating for you Gordon
[0:39:22] <+ArtemisCroc> the voice acting is so good
[0:39:22] <Solidnick18> nerd
[0:39:23] <NaturalGear> @RioGascar havok is just a moiddleware
[0:39:24] <thetrashman_sc> in the *test chamber*
[0:39:25] <iamtheTwitchghost> they're waiting for you gordon... in the TEST CHAMBER
[0:39:26] <LokimenD> Hazard Suit Pog
[0:39:26] <niddron> check beneath the desk

[0:39:26] <NeakGX> make haste, man.
[0:39:27] <Sapphire_Breeze> why do we have to wear these ridiculous ties
[0:39:28] <%Parapattern> These fuckin Nerdilingers
[0:39:29] <noyjatat> yo doods
[0:39:31] <pennykettle_> jesus man

[0:39:32] <Gregorhasjoined> In the test chamburrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
[0:39:33] <3rdRunner> MY. ASS. IS. HEAVY.
[0:39:34] <UnfilteredComic> Gordo
[0:39:35] <andrei11dr> Gordon's biggest personality trait is that he's a HUGE NERD
[0:39:35] <$TIME_PUNCHER> your bra bomb better work, nerdlinger
[0:39:37] <CrimsonSilver4> I think some of the VA was forced in some sections as if they were trying to replicate the old scientist memes but badly done.
[0:39:39] <heartlesshealer> @LokimenD We know he had a ponytail and then cut it off. That's 'something'. Maybe. Kinda. Probably
[0:39:44] <casualxxx> monitors from 2000 LUL LUL
[0:39:48] <+vaporousTippler> Two minutes in, security's already threatening to shoot Woolie.
[0:39:50] <%itmegwimble> The original HL box art had Gordon with a ponytail and future "bestseller" editions and the HL2 art had him without a ponytail, so that's what that joke is in reference to @woolieversus
[0:39:52] <@Solidus_113> God Gaben
[0:39:52] <ScreamLord> Pat would make a good Gordon VA if Ross Scott didn't already solidify his voice in my mind
[0:39:53] <CursedNobleman> no button :(
[0:39:53] <pennykettle_> aw shucks
[0:39:54] <+Bearborg> go fuck with the guard's controls
[0:39:56] <heartlesshealer> Oh wait, does Woolie know how to grab?
[0:40:00] <jasonisgold79> Yeah you can throw shit in peoples faces and they'll actually react to it.
[0:40:11] <natebud> All we know about Gordon is that all of his coworkers secretly despise him
[0:40:11] <%generalve> same voice actor LUL
[0:40:13] <DSD24> I hope there's techno music in the other room
[0:40:14] <NeakGX> ah geez we don't wanna leak that coolant

[1:04:06] <+Taithove> You're a glorified cart pusher
[1:04:09] <%Charronia> Gordon now knows what nuclear fusion feels like
[1:04:10] <natebud> The enemy placement in this game is Dark Souls levels, woolie doesn't stand a chance.
[1:04:11] <Streetshark_> fucking imagine them sitting up there watch him yeet himself into the laser
[1:04:11] <MattDemers> Watching Half Life in Half An Hour and then coming to this is hilarious
[1:04:12] <MoulesFritz> GAME TESTER
[1:04:15] <ZeeJiggle> Perfektly executed
[1:04:17] <thewizardchan> @WoolieVersus How about you listen to the instructions you're being given
[1:04:23] <%Tearonex> @WoolieVersus Reggie tell him to push the carrier into the beam of light
[1:04:23] <+tuchpi> @natebud true LUL
[1:04:25] <+WinstonThrasher> so woolie stuck his hand in to the reactor, turns out its not totally safe
[1:04:27] <Man_in_the_Red> havent you played TF2 before, gotta push the cart
[1:04:30] <Monkeyweed21> you're literally an overqualified handyman

[1:04:33] <jasonisgold79> @privatecorgi I mean you're not entirely long
[1:04:34] <ZeeJiggle> @WoolieVersus Reggie DON'T tell him to do the thing.
[1:04:35] <ZeeJiggle> Darn it
[1:04:35] <CrimsonSilver4> You can also refuse to do it for another achievment
[1:04:36] <+Bearborg> clever ruse to see all the cool effects again
[1:04:36] <OkamiDude15> Woolie you have to command grab the specimen and pressure them into the beam/corner
[1:04:39] <%Javaa01> Possibly
[1:04:39] <Grunkle_Dan_> The autosaves suck in this game but fortunately there is a quicksave
[1:04:40] <@Solidus_113> You walked passed it 3 times
[1:04:41] <%Javaa01> Maybe
[1:04:45] <niddron> I mean, if this actually happens it would be the best thing that could have happend to this world
[1:04:46] <%CrimsonCore90> Everything is a puzzle game with Woolie on controls!
[1:04:46] <%GeneralSCPatton> He's achieving levels of STUMBO that shouldn't be possible
[1:04:46] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[1:04:47] <%RioGascar> see i used to think valves play testing to a EXTREME DEGREE is a bit much

[1:13:53] <+YabbaTroll> no right
[1:13:53] <pennykettle_> you can crouch after jumping, its easier
[1:13:54] <Monkeyweed21> crouch while jumping
[1:13:54] <heartlesshealer> pull up legs during jump
[1:13:54] <Man_in_the_Red> Correct Kappa
[1:13:54] <FourthQueen> NONONONO
[1:13:54] <This_is_Marco> jump then crouch
[1:13:56] <natebud> WRONG
[1:13:56] <Jontman42> Jump first, crouch after
[1:13:57] <OkamiDude15> Neat
[1:13:57] <+Bearborg> REGGIE WRONG
[1:13:58] <%Javaa01> You jump FIRST, then HOLD crouch
[1:13:58] <TheRealSk1ll3s> NOOOOOO
[1:13:58] <Zeemod155> Super Mario?
[1:13:59] <+Comradeiota> Jump then crouch
[1:13:59] <%itmegwimble> No, jump and then crouch in the air
[1:13:59] <dukenux> Not YET
[1:14:00] <%Irridium> jump then crouch
[1:14:00] <Hawkbone_> Nope
[1:14:00] <casualxxx> yeh didnt this release in 1998
[1:14:00] <+SchmeatBoy> excuse me
[1:14:01] <UnfilteredComic> Jump then crouch
[1:14:01] <+kewlmyc> NO
[1:14:02] <TigerClaws12> it's after jumping
[1:14:02] <+Comradeiota> bend your knees in the air
[1:14:02] <FourthQueen> CROUCH AFTER JUMPING
[1:14:03] <+Bearborg> NO REGGIE
[1:14:03] <VJdarkworld> other way around, jump then crouch
[1:14:05] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus black mesa has auto crouch jumping as a setting by default, you don't need to do it
[1:14:05] <Streetshark_> now go rocketjump
[1:14:06] <atravelbee> Crouch in MIDAIR
[1:14:06] <+HeavyMetalIceCream> you can autocrouch jump in the settings
[1:14:09] <+crimsonharvest> its for pulling your legs up to get into small holes
[1:14:09] <NaturalGear> not yet
[1:14:09] <andrei11dr> Iep ,5 year old me shat his pants right there
[1:14:10] <+Bearborg> YES
[1:14:10] <TheRealSk1ll3s> You jump and crouch in midair
[1:14:10] <+YabbaTroll> two different things
[1:14:11] <LoneO7> you might get it later
[1:14:11] <cache_22> It basically allows you to tuck your legs in midair so you can jump slightly higher or further.
[1:14:12] <+Comradeiota> It makes it so you're slightly higher in the air
[1:14:13] <ZeeJiggle> I feel like both ways work for this but I dunno
[1:14:14] <+crazyspartan214> Woolie please don't pull off a DSP!!!
[1:14:15] <This_is_Marco> jump and immedietly crouch
[1:14:15] <masterfire23> source tech and bhopping time?
[1:14:17] <Man_in_the_Red> mirrors edge
[1:14:18] <thebehatted> and higher too
[1:14:18] <Toxicjok3r1209> later
[1:14:18] <cryptods137> and it's height not distance
[1:14:18] <UnfilteredComic> Exactly
[1:14:19] <natebud> The longjump is unlocked later
[1:14:21] <dukenux> you get the long jump veeery late in the game. atleast in the original
[1:14:23] <Itz_Soundwave> CRUNCH
[1:14:23] <thegreatbambe> Whose he talking to
[1:14:23] <Halospaz117> for fitting in stuff
[1:14:24] <awalr> crouch in air, lets you land on tricky ledges better
[1:14:25] <+Comradeiota> Very slightly extra height
[1:14:26] <Calern> it's useful all the time
[1:14:27] <SoySocks> the big benefit is jumping onto higher up stuff
[1:14:28] <Yung_FckUp> do the bunnyhop
[1:14:30] <LoneO7> you get a longjump later
[1:14:37] <%Feifong_wong> Get the blue thing
[1:14:37] <+YabbaTroll> Does black mesa have the hazard course?
[1:14:40] <OkamiDude15> Is b-hopping still intact?
[1:14:41] <@Solidus_113> BURN THEM

[1:21:45] <Pistachius> i wonder if Woolz will play Blue-Shift and Opposing Force
[1:21:48] <gazdropish> i can't
[1:21:53] <unit24> woolie needs to learn to manually save
[1:21:53] <NeakGX> that's 3? death now?
[1:21:55] <jasonisgold79> And this is why Quicksaving is important.
[1:21:58] <@Solidus_113> remember when GabeN said. you have to follow the lights
[1:22:02] <niddron> yup third death
[1:22:02] <uncle_christian> The A.I. IS bland
[1:22:06] <+greenfall> @WoolieVersus remember too quick save F6
[1:22:09] <natebud> Is quicksave an option on console?
[1:22:11] <+robobeau> That's funny, I'm in the same scene, as I watch the stream, and I'm stuck in the same place
[1:22:13] <%RioGascar> source ai is kinda simple
[1:22:17] <+robobeau> It's just a dead end pit
[1:22:18] <heartlesshealer> physics damage
[1:22:18] <awalr> always manual save if you're planning of doing a science experiment on a bottomless pit
[1:22:19] <%GeneralSCPatton> LEARN TO SAVE
[1:22:27] <thewizardchan> @WoolieVersus Get into the habit of quicksaving before you take big risks
[1:22:28] <%RioGascar> Its better than gold src ai
[1:22:29] <+Bearborg> @natebud he's on PC, just with a controller
[1:22:31] <+Bluemanzee> He gave you a fracture
[1:22:31] <@Solidus_113> maybe don't quicksave with no health
[1:22:32] <+commanderclaw> Yeah, quicksave is your friend
[1:22:32] <BlueMoonBlues> vent
[1:22:34] <+thegreenbenis> look right

[1:22:41] <+HeavyMetalIceCream> oh that promotion joke
[1:22:42] <%RioGascar> i dont think woolie can quicksave
[1:22:42] <masterfire23> @this_is_marco its public access to source 2 so maybe an updated gmod
[1:22:45] <MattDemers> Woolie loves him some flares
[1:22:46] <+crimsonharvest> you just need to hug the walls its fine
[1:22:46] <MrMysteryMask> take the vents

[1:39:51] <pennykettle_> Half Life is big resource management
[1:39:53] <%Charronia> rooLick
[1:39:53] <%RioGascar> or he will be conservative with it
[1:39:55] <heartlesshealer> Each and every one of them spits out skulls
[1:39:55] <+xx123manxx> It had s et fire rate but you could blast it with alt fire @dukenux

[1:39:59] <mMayrro> sexy reload Kreygasm
[1:40:00] <uncle_christian> Woolie be sure to scream I'M NOT SCARED OF YOU ANY MORE as you fire. XD
[1:40:01] <Apollo1818> @dukenux Yeah, and it sucked compared to firing it normally.
[1:40:02] <heartlesshealer> every barnacle has claimed a human
[1:40:07] <FrankysDream> @WoolieVersus this is NOT survival horror
[1:40:11] <Man_in_the_Red> i never had to conserve ammo since i scavenged like a fallout player
[1:40:14] <+crimsonharvest> oh try the gray crates

[1:47:12] <awalr> almost too far enough
[1:47:13] <@Solidus_113> water will always dampen your falls
[1:47:17] <PsychedelicSnake> Why is it stuttering so much anyway. Didn't have that problem in my run
[1:47:18] <natebud> Water always prevents fall damage
[1:47:19] <Oxybe> The answer may surprise you!
[1:47:20] <uncle_christian> Barrels
[1:47:22] <heartlesshealer> Water helped
[1:47:28] <Zeemod155> Hacks
[1:47:31] <%RioGascar> Woolie consider physics
[1:47:31] <CrimsonGargoyle> swing first never ask questions
[1:47:32] <NeakGX> CROWBARABLE
[1:47:36] <uncle_christian> CROW IRON TARKUS
[1:47:36] <pennykettle_> PsychedelicSnake me neither. just brainstorming, maybe its the controller
[1:47:42] <%RioGascar> you can also break your fall with an object
[1:47:43] <%Charronia> Purge the filthy xenos rooH
[1:47:48] <andrei11dr> WORLDSTAR!!!
[1:47:51] <Second_Omega> Crowbarability is not a scale, It either can be or can't
[1:47:52] <Agami23> this is a good spot to get a real good look at the barnicles
[1:47:56] <mitochondriahousepower> Zoning
[1:47:57] <cryptods137> BARRELy any damage
[1:47:58] <MattDemers> Do the headcrabs come off zombies while alive in this game?
[1:48:03] <Talinu> Has Woolie played HL2?
[1:48:04] <CrimsonGargoyle> @Second_Omega not with that crowbaritude
[1:48:06] <pennykettle_> yes MattDemers
[1:48:06] <Dr_Mooose> the footsies

[1:48:18] <ZeeJiggle> Yo footsies
[1:48:19] <cache_22> Woolie is going to order a crowbar after this stream, right?
[1:48:19] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1237401882802429957
[1:48:28] <Solidnick18> don't need bullets huh
[1:48:31] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:48:38] <Oxybe> barnacle
[1:48:41] <uncle_christian> Woolie has the swing to be an NYPD cop
[1:48:42] <%RioGascar> yeah that tactic will definitely work...for a long tiem
[1:48:43] <Solidnick18> Ew
[1:48:44] <%RioGascar> Definitely
[1:48:48] <pennykettle_> wait wtf are those eyes on the top? Never seen that
[1:48:49] <+xx123manxx> I don't think he's making it to We've got hostiles so this is a crowbar exclusive stream
[1:48:54] <+kiwiredgrave> spooky dicks
[1:48:56] <Zeemod155> LUL
[1:49:02] <uncle_christian> YOSHI tongue
[1:49:05] <trickquestionz> COMBINE SPREAD CORONA
[1:49:06] <%RioGascar> He is doing full lp
[1:49:06] <Tazok_The_Calm> And people in the chat was afraid he would waste ammo LUL
[1:49:07] <cryptods137> Woolie might need to lower his settings a bit because this studdering is ridiculous
[1:49:08] <VJdarkworld> crowbar only run PogChamp
[1:49:09] <Solidnick18> that's instant
[1:49:11] <+crimsonharvest> ohhhh my little sneezy one
[1:49:11] <jasonisgold79> Too real Woolie
[1:49:12] <Zeemod155> keep you face AWAY from that
[1:49:16] <+thegreenbenis> Corona
[1:49:23] <dukenux> The Resonance Coronascade
[1:49:23] <Blafy> oh half life, yeah I had this on the orange box great game. HALF LIFE 3???
[1:49:24] <Second_Omega> Gotta love Opposing force letting you shove your hand in the back of a barnacle and spidermaning about
[1:49:26] <zafooru> A crowbar is a gun too!
[1:49:27] <PsychedelicSnake> Looking up at things lets you swing at things above you. amazing technology
[1:49:34] <Oxybe> Y'all wallingnin knee high poop juisce but the barnacle is the C-virus hose
[1:49:37] <+greenfall> freemans mind ver woolie and reggie
[1:49:40] <andrei11dr> 2020 looking just as great as this predicted Kappa
[1:49:43] <uncle_christian> 5?
[1:49:44] <%CrimsonCore90> Of course it’s a crowbar only ruin. This makes it all footsies
[1:49:44] <@Solidus_113> yes
[1:49:44] <natebud> 5 bullets i know
[1:49:45] <theKingRamses> i think it was 5 swings
[1:49:49] <heartlesshealer> Every barnacle drops a skull
[1:49:50] <Solidnick18> yes
[1:49:51] <+greenfall> quick save woolie
[1:49:52] <UnfilteredComic> Crowbar is just as strong as pistol bullet
[1:49:53] <DSD24> 'Oh no this was stupid I'm gonna die!"
[1:49:54] <pennykettle_> I know crowbar deals more damage against headcrabs
[1:49:55] <Th3rd3> that his dinner
[1:49:57] <%CrimsonCore90> Damn he said it before I finished typing
[1:49:59] <zafooru> move FAST
[1:50:03] <uncle_christian> PEE PEE eww
[1:50:07] <%Charronia> This entire alien race is trying to lick you
[1:50:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> Cheer500 The ceiling boys, barnacles, are more crowbar-able than you'd think. Real men catch a ride to the top to deliver a beating. Low chance of damage with optimal swings.
[1:50:30] <%RioGascar> valve game design comes through sometimeeesss
[1:50:36] <natebud> Mostly just your zombified coworkers
[1:50:37] <pennykettle_> when it loads it autosaves I believe

[1:52:15] <NaturalGear> yup, Akira this section was inspired by Akira according to the original level designer
[1:52:15] <+ianabstract> MAWP

[1:52:18] <jasonisgold79> DO IT WOOLIE! You know ypu want too.
[1:52:19] <%RioGascar> man this game just really goes to show how good valve is at playtesting and design
[1:52:20] <a_mad_dragon> around 2% of wooden crates have pickups
[1:52:26] <Solidnick18> that would be great
[1:52:30] <+thegreenbenis> You'll go deaf if you shoot in the vents.
[1:52:30] <Superdandy96> I can’t believe Reggie got corrupted by loot boxes, poor soul

[2:04:59] <mitochondriahousepower> Corpse (Nothing)
[2:05:00] <jasonisgold79> Besides, there's a dark side to E-Sports that I don't blame Nintendo for not getting a part of.
[2:05:04] <FrankysDream> CORPSE NOTHING
[2:05:13] <zafooru> Explosive Box!
[2:05:16] <Toxicjok3r1209> in a facility full of virgins, gordon is the only chad
[2:05:24] <uncle_christian> YAY
[2:05:25] <Man_in_the_Red> @jasonisgold79 cant wait for that bubble to burst
[2:05:29] <Gregorhasjoined> Testing in progress...
[2:05:29] <JoeStillLife> yuge range
[2:05:32] <dukenux> source physics
[2:05:35] <awalr> because explosives
[2:05:35] <+crimsonharvest> high explosives are like that
[2:05:36] <PsychedelicSnake> Explosions are more than fire woolie
[2:05:38] <%Pillagius> Magic!
[2:05:38] <Zeemod155> Wa How?
[2:05:41] <+Milpool> so big Kreygasm
[2:05:43] <%Charronia> Michael Bay explosions
[2:05:43] <mitochondriahousepower> BIG BANG
[2:05:45] <Man_in_the_Red> its halfway to RE6 barrels
[2:05:45] <+Flunkorg> Woolie: "its so big!"
[2:05:45] <uncle_christian> save and test BLK barrel
[2:05:51] <%RioGascar> this is exactly the way i learned how this stuff worked
[2:05:55] <Gregorhasjoined> Someone please get woolie on Gmod
[2:05:55] <awalr> pls nobody let woolie near fireworks
[2:05:58] <worldbrand> might be worth testing to see if picking them up and throwing them causes an explosion, because it does with the gravity gun
[2:06:00] <Rellim80> There were nades in the box
[2:06:07] <Superdandy96> So big KappaPride
[2:06:07] <uncle_christian> Woolie breaks crates <3
[2:06:12] <heartlesshealer> ENJOY
[2:06:13] <+Flunkorg> Oh no...

[2:06:17] <Haarute> yeyeyeye
[2:06:18] <natebud> hands are sweaty
[2:06:19] <%RioGascar> however the way half life explosive barrels work is VERY UNIQUE
[2:06:19] <jasonisgold79> @Man_in_the_Red If they do they do, if they don't they don't. I don't get into E-Sports so I don't think I'm affected either way.
[2:06:20] <@Solidus_113> PLATFORMING
[2:06:20] <MattDemers> Time for PLATFORMAN

[2:06:37] <Haarute> SAVE
[2:06:38] <andrei11dr> Platforming time
[2:06:41] <natebud> a little bit of horror
[2:06:43] <awalr> dying horror
[2:06:45] <dukenux> pretty muvj
[2:06:45] <+crimsonharvest> it kind of is for part of it but there's progression
[2:06:45] <%itmegwimble> And nah, Half-life is an FPS with horror themes
[2:06:46] <uncle_christian> Wonka Designed this room :)
[2:06:47] <fangovafang> Generation Zero vibes LUL LUL LUL
[2:06:48] <PsychedelicSnake> The first third of Half-Life is very horror oriented

[2:06:49] <%RioGascar> in this series the crates set on fire for a brief time and THEN EXPLODE
[2:06:50] <@Moobot> Please don't fill up the entire chat, @Oxybe
[2:06:50] <+CJett92> A little bit of horror, as a treat

[2:07:05] <heartlesshealer> save
[2:07:05] <%Charronia> Aww, no drilling zombies :(
[2:07:06] <Dr_Mooose> why drill when you can crowbar
[2:07:07] <UnfilteredComic> Horror Atmosphere, isnt really reflected in the gameplay
[2:07:07] <dukenux> first hours are pretty horrory
[2:07:10] <%RioGascar> its a perfectly paced game
[2:07:12] <uncle_christian> Hop skip n jump
[2:07:13] <Second_Omega> Hit that QS
[2:07:13] <+crimsonharvest> save
[2:07:14] <StarlitStunner> FEAR is good first person horror
[2:07:15] <andrei11dr> It's a physics shooter
[2:07:15] <sexdrugsvideogames> 1st person platforming
[2:07:16] <%RioGascar> with tons of variety
[2:07:16] <dukenux> Ravenholm tho
[2:07:16] <MattDemers> Once you get SHOTGUN
[2:07:18] <+Milpool> save
[2:07:19] <%Double_Tap_That> Not realizing he can crowbar planks is a bad lesson to learn
[2:07:19] <@Solidus_113> Ravenholm in HL2 is horrow
[2:07:20] <MattDemers> Get ready for SHOTFUN
[2:07:23] <@Solidus_113> horror
[2:07:24] <Zeemod155> Half-Life did Doom 3 right before Doom 3 existed
[2:07:24] <NaturalGear> Doom 3 is more of a horror shooter, HL is just atmospheric
[2:07:25] <+WinstonThrasher> everything takes five hits, hits plank four times "nope"
[2:07:25] <FrankysDream> @WoolieVersus woolie you have almost 100 bullets

[2:08:19] <zafooru> 1st person platforming was a mistake
[2:08:21] <uncle_christian> save me CROW
[2:08:23] <andrei11dr> Thats 6
[2:08:27] <%itmegwimble> 1st person platforming with a controller is a nightmare
[2:08:28] <jasonisgold79> Instantly
[2:08:28] <sexdrugsvideogames> door is closed
[2:08:30] <+Bearborg> internal bleeding
[2:08:30] <heartlesshealer> Depends on spine
[2:08:31] <%Double_Tap_That> Woolie VS First-person platforming
[2:08:31] <+crimsonharvest> it depends on how you hit the ground
[2:08:34] <+thegreenbenis> Instantly
[2:08:36] <uncle_christian> Define Survive XD
[2:08:37] <VJdarkworld> starvation?
[2:08:37] <Oxybe> depends where you fall
[2:08:38] <Solidnick18> that's nuts
[2:08:39] <JoeStillLife> Peggy Hill survived
[2:08:40] <+Milpool> people also die falling off ladders
[2:08:45] <awalr> depends on what you hit
[2:08:48] <@Solidus_113> fall head first always
[2:08:51] <%RioGascar> its just physics
[2:08:52] <heartlesshealer> body physics is real
[2:08:52] <zafooru> don't land on your head
[2:08:52] <uncle_christian> Christopher Reeve Survived
[2:08:56] <Gregorhasjoined> Sometimes the pain stops your heart, but not likely
[2:08:58] <jorniev> this rooms makes so little sense in the original game
[2:09:01] <%Will9099> ahh yes the tactical bellyflop
[2:09:01] <%RioGascar> hell drunk people survive car crashs
[2:09:02] <Man_in_the_Red> just belly flop
[2:09:03] <+Pookiedaexzile> A real one just here to say, I literally only know what half life is from Xplay episodes when I was 6 or 7
[2:09:03] <+Qsmash_> don't tense up your body
[2:09:03] <+xx123manxx> 2nd try chad gamer
[2:09:08] <zafooru> Elephants are weak to fall damage
[2:09:09] <%itmegwimble> hit some branches on your way down and then you'll only break *most* of your bones
[2:09:10] <Th3rd3> it's RNG Reggie TPFufun
[2:09:11] <SailingSaturn> But then you'll wish you died instantly cirNom
[2:09:13] <jorniev> freemans mind is the best lp
[2:09:13] <%Exiliator> People can also die from tripping when just walking normally
[2:09:14] <natebud> thats a quicksave right there
[2:09:16] <uncle_christian> CRATE
[2:09:17] <thesickestzak> Just hold forward to roll if you fall out of plane. ezpz
[2:09:18] <Oxybe> depends on what you land on, what part of the body connects
[2:09:20] <awalr> aim for a tree, the limbs will break your fall. and also break your limbs.
[2:09:22] <heartlesshealer> A 3 foot fall can be fatal if you do your neck wrong

[2:21:30] <UnfilteredComic> No cutscenes in this game
[2:21:30] <%itmegwimble> @WoolieVersus fun fact: Houndeyes (the screamy boys) were originally supposed to be passive and even friendly to the player in the original version of the game, but playtesters kept killing them despite every attempt to try to mark them as friendly, so in the release version of Half-life they were made hostile only. Poor little guys :(

[2:47:16] <+neuwaive> very weird to see this stuff with new graphics, and not hear ross scott yelling
[2:47:30] <+Pookiedaexzile> This is NEW?
[2:47:36] <+StooEsq> @BurdRightsActivist Had to look up HECU, but that's dead on

[2:48:40] <%RioGascar> The facility was done 6 years ago but they did a visual pass through of the entire game prior to xen to get the visuals and design up to snuff

[2:57:58] <+Keyd00d> It's true
[2:57:58] <+pedrothecruel> wrong
[2:58:01] <Oleai> Wrong.
[2:58:03] <+daveronald> too controversial
[2:58:05] <FuqBoiSlim> perhaps
[2:58:06] <+jiggy_snipe> Reggie's a coward
[2:58:09] <SchroedingersFerret> Wrong
[2:58:09] <BurdRightsActivist> it's TRUE
[2:58:11] <Croetec> its true
[2:58:11] <Superdandy96> What a hot take
[2:58:13] <$razielhex> Del Monte were involved in human trafficking and slave labor in American Samoa for decades and opposed the establishment of a minimum wage for the farmers they employed.
[2:58:13] <laserbeaming> Uncanned peaches are good though
[2:58:17] <Manwad> objectively subjectively wrong
[2:58:18] <arkv01> weird flex
[2:58:21] <Oleai> Bad take. You just like sugar. You insult the sanctity of peaches.
[2:58:21] <+pedrothecruel> incorrect
[2:58:25] <+greenfall> too much sugar
[2:58:27] <awalr> they hated him because he told the truth
[2:58:28] <NaturalGear> canned pineapple is definitely better than uncanned pineapple

[3:11:10] <PsychedelicSnake> I do
[3:11:10] <GarbageNirvana> After that half-controller half-mouse FPS configuration I question nothing anymore
[3:11:17] <+gustavozxd> you should
[3:11:18] <Hawkbone_> What about fighting games with a Mouse and Keyboard
[3:11:20] <awalr> woolie vs ion fury
[3:11:21] <+dosan121> yeyeye amid evil lp seconded
[3:11:21] <@Solidus_113> you're not controlling a camera with a arcade stick
[3:11:25] <%Exiliator> Then get one!
[3:11:25] <%RioGascar> the first good thing to happen in half life 2’s story didnt happen till the very end and in episode 2 at the end
[3:11:29] <$razielhex> TV tray like the boomers
[3:11:30] <noyjatat> Woolie vs Beat saber
[3:11:42] <%rytyoung> FPSWoolie's eSports career begins with Titanfall 3
[3:11:44] <Oxybe> Woolie VS Fortnite when? LUL
[3:11:45] <+gustavozxd> atpRtsd
[3:11:48] <+jay521> use mouse to aim and one hand on controller to move
[3:11:48] <+arancet> controller is more relaxing to use
[3:11:49] <zhu000> un master race
[3:11:49] <Dr_Mooose> I feel that
[3:11:49] <%RioGascar> And even then the worst thing happens in episode 2
[3:11:54] <%itmegwimble> and the good thing at the end of ep2 is immeidatley followed by bad shit
[3:11:56] <%Exiliator> You dont move your hand tho...
[3:11:57] <+chiluzza> being terrible is the first step at being kinda good at something
[3:11:58] <PsychedelicSnake> There are indentations on the keys
[3:11:59] <+D00msDayDan> that's what the notch on f is for
[3:12:00] <+gustavozxd> that's something people got used to I guess
[3:12:03] <%itmegwimble> And even worse implications and threats to existence itself via the borealis
[3:12:05] <+dosan121> esdf masterrace
[3:12:07] <Azathotic> @WoolieVersus You don't half to press half of those keys
[3:12:10] <sexdrugsvideogames> you can learn
[3:12:13] <josolomon> Its just a bigger fighting stick Woolie
[3:12:13] <@Solidus_113> some people use TFGH
[3:12:13] <$razielhex> 25 years. But close enough.
[3:12:14] <Hawkbone_> Now you understand what its like to play fighting games, Woolie.
[3:12:15] <laserbeaming> next time: Woolie playing a shooter in a Hitbox
[3:12:16] <mMayrro> that's why F and J have the thingies on them
[3:12:20] <DatAsuna> it's functional but also yes it is less precise
[3:12:24] <DSD24> Keyboarding Class
[3:12:24] <+gustavozxd> typing class!? wtf
[3:12:25] <Azathotic> No, you get used to it
[3:12:26] <GarbageNirvana> Keyboard movement is suboptimal, period
[3:12:29] <KnivesEve> soooo WoolieVs Fortnite confirmed?
[3:12:29] <Jolly_Adventurer> T-Rex tap
[3:12:31] <DatAsuna> because it's a boolean input
[3:12:31] <Azathotic> It's not that hard to switch
[3:12:32] <natebud> Just never take your middle finger off W
[3:12:35] <Agami23> half life was one of the games that made people use most of those buttons
[3:12:36] <DatAsuna> you're moving forward or you're not
[3:12:40] <Oxybe> its the arcade stick thing @woolieversus
[3:12:41] <GarbageNirvana> Aiming not so much
[3:12:41] <%Will9099> touch typing is kinda the norm tho
[3:12:44] <%Exiliator> When playing a fps you dont really let go of wasd
[3:12:53] <xbb1024> You will need the mouse aiming control if you want to play competitive fps
[3:12:53] <sexdrugsvideogames> everything is hard in the beginning
[3:12:53] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1237401882802429957
[3:12:56] <DatAsuna> you're moving at full speed or holding shift .etc to slow walk
[3:12:57] <+StooEsq> depending on the keyboard, there's some raised keycaps you could probably buy for WASD
[3:12:59] <Nekros4442> It's literally the arcade stick thing
[3:13:01] <Hawkbone_> That hatred for the unfamiliar you have is exactly what it feels like to try getting into fighting games
[3:13:03] <Dr_Mooose> depends on the game
[3:13:05] <%The_Timo> pve?
[3:13:06] <$razielhex> @mMayrro F and J have the marks for home-rows typing.
[3:13:09] <DatAsuna> but never the analogue stick level of variable input
[3:13:10] <@Solidus_113> Mouse DPI settings also are much better than an analog stick's deadzone
[3:13:13] <+MultiTrip> just know how to do it 4Head
[3:13:17] <natebud> @The_Timo LUL
[3:13:18] <GarbageNirvana> Try playing an FPS with an arcade stick y'all
[3:13:20] <DatAsuna> so for platforming it's far worse
[3:13:22] <GarbageNirvana> See how you like it
[3:13:25] <sexdrugsvideogames> depends on the game
[3:13:30] <+arancet> i can use kbm fine, but in noncompetitive controller is more enjoyable
[3:13:30] <%Irridium> do the hybrid shit that thing's great
[3:13:36] <DatAsuna> For mirror's edge the hybrid is probably the best of both worlds
[3:13:40] <Melchior_the_Wise> Do you agree with that in competitive context?
[3:13:40] <sexdrugsvideogames> you played overwatch
[3:13:41] <%Sogeki_Dan> Then be condemned to scrub tier
[3:13:48] <rosemon5001> playing worse just because
[3:13:48] <DatAsuna> keep the fast ariming and scroll wheel, but the analogue movement
[3:13:49] <Man_F_Artwish> I like the steam controller for FPS fight me
[3:13:53] <$razielhex> @GarbageNirvana Mortal Kombat was ported to the AMIGA a long time ago, and the AMIGA controller has a joystick and 1 (ONE) button
[3:14:09] <GarbageNirvana> @razielhex The Amiga's also objectively trash
[3:14:13] <DatAsuna> and yeah I like my DPI switch mouse for games like siege
[3:14:14] <+WinstonThrasher> brrutdutdut
[3:14:20] <Rangenade> pressing up to jump is alien to me tbh
[3:14:21] <$razielhex> irrelevant
[3:14:32] <awalr> there are some keypads with thumbsticks, i wonder how well those work
[3:14:52] <alextrebeken> gamer cube?
[3:14:55] <%linSP> Joystick movement with mouse aim is optimal
[3:15:00] <+jay521> on kirby?
[3:15:08] <$razielhex> @WoolieVersus RAZER NOSTROMO
[3:15:16] <%Javaa01> It was originally built for RTS
[3:15:24] <%Javaa01> Not FPS
[3:15:29] <@Solidus_113> They're one-handed keyboards
[3:15:32] <$razielhex> Hell, MMORPG players use them too
[3:15:35] <DatAsuna> TRACKBALLS FOR LIFE
[3:15:36] <Melchior_the_Wise> I fucking hate track ball mice
[3:15:41] <NaturalGear> it's worth getting used to it imho, even if it's just for singleplayer
[3:15:48] <Dr_Mooose> I always wanted to try a one handed keyboard
[3:15:57] <sexdrugsvideogames> flight stick for movement?
[3:15:59] <+Nobrev> I remember square enix produced one specifically for ffxiv
[3:16:20] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> I used that too it was great
[3:16:28] <@Solidus_113> it's WACK

[3:16:52] <Melchior_the_Wise> has Woolie died yet?
[3:16:55] <Louie_Salmon> Don't ever stop living your strange reality
[3:16:59] <DatAsuna> It's real bad in GTA as well for driving
[3:17:00] <Hawkbone_> Just git gud, Woolie. Learn those inputs.
[3:17:01] <GarbageNirvana> It's not like he's trying to enter Melee tournaments with busted-ass Gamecube controllers or anything
[3:17:06] <%Exiliator> So what youre saying is... Youre traaaash!
[3:17:07] <thewizardchan> Crazy idea - develop a joycon-like controller for the left hand to use with a mouse.
[3:17:13] <DatAsuna> so for GTA online I always have botht he mouse and the controller handy

[3:36:48] <DSD24> Halo Flood
[3:36:49] <Chatterbox1991> Headcrab
[3:36:52] <+neuwaive> Headcrab you're still aware

[3:37:03] <Chatterbox1991> @WoolieVersus also the Borg
[3:37:04] <$GoogleyGareth> Headcrab. Headcrabs don't kill you.
[3:37:08] <%NerevaRising> LIES
[3:37:12] <$GoogleyGareth> You're alive the whole time
[3:37:13] <DSD24> Woolie hates Animorphs
[3:37:15] <@Solidus_113> YOU'VE NEVER PLAYED DEAD SPACE
[3:37:15] <+CalciteCandy> !uptime
[3:37:16] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 37 minutes
[3:37:18] <@Solidus_113> YOU
[3:37:18] <Jack_of_No_Trades> Headcrab is worst, look up the voice clips from HL2
[3:37:19] <peachy996> You should get started on Dead Space
[3:37:24] <DSD24> Woolie would love Dead Space
[3:37:24] <Spydurman> you're the biggest Animorphs fan though
[3:37:25] <peachy996> It's pretty good
[3:37:27] <neilgilbertg97> You should play Dead Space
[3:37:27] <@akuda_bar> dead space is ok
[3:37:27] <rosemon5001> DEAD SPACE 100% worst
[3:37:31] <Tampaoster> deadspace lp when?
[3:37:32] <DatAsuna> Speaking of halo stop sandbagging my halo correction email xD
[3:37:32] <heartlesshealer> Yeerks is prisoner of your own mind while sentient parasite can shit talk you and control your body. You still feel everything
[3:37:34] <awalr> big half life expert woolie PogChamp
[3:37:36] <DSD24> Dead Space 1 and 2 only though
[3:37:38] <Solidnick18> dead space lp when
[3:37:40] <DatAsuna> Halo was an RTS first
[3:37:41] <+Pyroclase> You never played Dead Space?!
[3:37:41] <%blaccbird914> necromorphs are an instant transformation though
[3:37:42] <peachy996> yeah don't touch 3
[3:37:43] <$GoogleyGareth> @Solidus_113 YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED DEAD SPACE NOTE?
[3:37:43] <+Deadpool2450> level up your scholastic book fair tech Woolie!
[3:37:44] <startstoprepeat> the only time yeerks aren't in complete control of you, you're caged while they're recharging
[3:37:45] <Shardlab> Yeerks just keep you as a meat suit
[3:37:47] <Reizie_Etherealm> Halo flood also don't kill you, they merge into your central nervous system and control your body
[3:37:51] <KaliasTV> Animorphs is basically headcrab but people can't tell you're a zombie
[3:37:54] <atravelbee> oH Dear plz play eventually
[3:37:55] <+arancet> dead space and halo, you're dead, so not as bad
[3:37:56] <NeroInfinite> Yerks just keep you as a meat suit
[3:37:58] <DatAsuna> the best one
[3:37:58] <Dr_Mooose> are they still aware in dead space?
[3:37:59] <DSD24> The Rail Shooter
[3:37:59] <+glgzephyr> oh no
[3:38:00] <YakumoYomi> The Wii one?
[3:38:05] <Shardlab> And you get a taste of freedom at gunpoint every three days
[3:38:06] <+glgzephyr> yeah it was the Wii
[3:38:07] <DatAsuna> Wii not gamecube
[3:38:07] <%Javaa01> Wii rail shooter
[3:38:08] <+arancet> animorphs, youre controlled, but not a monster, its just mind control
[3:38:09] <+glgzephyr> it was not great
[3:38:09] <Solidnick18> the the rail shooter
[3:38:11] <+arancet> headcrabs worst
[3:38:15] <peachy996> Think of Bloodborne's insane wave once you beat Rom
[3:38:15] <noyjatat> Have not thought about Animorphs since middle school
[3:38:19] <Dg10262> Are animorphs part of transfomers universe? Or am I crazy?
[3:38:20] <DatAsuna> But yeah extraction is unironically the peak of deadspace
[3:38:22] <Shardlab> And then the slug goes back in your head betraying your loved ones
[3:38:24] <Oxybe> @woolieversus Yeerk. brainslug that hides in you, controls you and you stay conscious. and if you eat instant oatmeal they bind to your brain and you both go batshit
[3:38:24] <fairore> @kaliastv that's bullshit cmonBruh
[3:38:27] <+glgzephyr> Woolie, you would quite enjoy Dead Space
[3:38:27] <@akuda_bar> I dunno if you're still alive when you're a dead space
[3:38:31] <heartlesshealer> mind control but still feeling all of your senses
[3:38:37] <Melchior_the_Wise> Dead Space is kinda like the newer RE games
[3:38:50] <DSD24> Suffer like G did
[3:38:52] <trianglehat> fair take
[3:38:55] <Jack_of_No_Trades> And you scream the whole time
[3:38:57] <KruelDestiny> Jason Waterfalls shouldn't have been after the head crabs
[3:38:59] <rosemon5001> immortal hive mine slavery is way worse
[3:38:59] <+Pyroclase> Headcrabs are honestly the correct answer, they both cause you pain but keep you alive.
[3:39:08] <%Javaa01> You suffer until your body falls apart
[3:39:11] <+prime_name> Mimic-Tatsu
[3:39:13] <noyjatat> @Oxybe that was just Nicelodeon bs
[3:39:16] <worldbrand> the teeth are fingers
[3:39:17] <peachy996> and laughs like a big creepo
[3:39:18] <%FenixSeraph> wooliePOYO
[3:39:23] <Shardlab> @Oxybe Instant Maple Oatmeal. It's like crack to em
[3:39:25] <heartlesshealer> It stands up and beats the hell out of you
[3:39:28] <@Solidus_113> the teeth are finger bones
[3:39:34] <Dr_Mooose> it looks goofy, but will kick your ass
[3:39:35] <+ducethegamer> the ryu of dark souls
[3:39:38] <+DRAGKUDO> Black Mesa HahaThink
[3:39:46] <Louie_Salmon> The tatsu is LETHAL
[3:39:49] <heartlesshealer> 60% health
[3:39:58] <serpenttucker> @WoolieVersus How do you feel about monster that incorporate you into their form, like the thing from...well the thing, and the flood for instance?
[3:40:00] <@akuda_bar> if you're still alive when you're deadspaced then yeah that's worse than headcrabbing
[3:40:02] <OToole42> and it laughs while it does it
[3:40:08] <peachy996> A mimic will fight a boss
[3:40:11] <Oxybe> @noyjatat one of the early books. somewhere like 15-20
[3:40:12] <+prime_name> Pat got rocked by it in the DS3 LP
[3:40:13] <peachy996> and do some damage
[3:40:17] <mMayrro> and then there was the ds2 mimics
[3:40:19] <+SaurianCrash> its just a jumping spin kick or one spin tatsu
[3:40:21] <@Solidus_113> The mimic also has a baby-punt kick
[3:40:23] <+glgzephyr> pretty sure that necromorphs are not in there anymore
[3:40:49] <heartlesshealer> necromorphs are killed during transformation
[3:41:08] <heartlesshealer> from what I remember
[3:41:08] <+glgzephyr> yeah if not before
[3:41:08] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1237401882802429957
[3:41:08] <Shardlab> Yup, necromorphs are just meat
[3:41:10] <atravelbee> Marker hive-mind, right?
[3:41:14] <MurlinDurl> mimics and that field goal kick
[3:41:15] <@akuda_bar> ah yeah then that's fine
[3:41:27] <goose_attack_almanac> Necromorphs are just meat. But the process leading up to a Neromorph outbreak is horrific
[3:41:28] <Hawkbone_> What the fuck was that Woolie noise?
[3:41:31] <natebud> Black Mesa has a bit of trouble highlighting the path forward. One of the downsides of adding more detail to levels.
[3:41:33] <+glgzephyr> the transformation while alive is probably not pleasant
[3:41:36] <KaliasTV> screaming meat
[3:41:36] <rosemon5001> @heartlesshealer they are all part of a hive mind
[3:41:44] <@akuda_bar> if you had to be aware while your body is getting kitbashed that would be unpleasant
[3:41:46] <MurlinDurl> that does not compute with the woolie
[3:41:48] <+chiluzza> Its Gman
[3:41:54] <+MultiTrip> just play it perfect the first time
[3:41:54] <Shardlab> pushing air through meat is how we talk
[3:41:58] <@Solidus_113> you missed that guy falling off the ladder trying to save someone
[3:42:00] <DatAsuna> The only solution is having a LilV who knows everything
[3:42:04] <Solidnick18> yeah
[3:42:04] <startstoprepeat> it's fiiiine
[3:42:04] <mMayrro> did you blow up the soufle?
[3:42:05] <TJW211> just play it how you would normally bro
[3:42:08] <%Javaa01> There's stuff always happening
[3:42:11] <Solidnick18> idk
[3:42:19] <heartlesshealer> Yeah, but like, I'm thinking hivemind phase is when the individual human sense of self dies
[3:42:20] <Shardlab> So yeah, it sounds crazy unpleasant as an alien... thing does it with your dead meatsuit
[3:42:20] <Tampaoster> yes he did blow up the sufle
[3:42:21] <zhu000> just play
[3:42:22] <%RioGascar> it doesnt remvoe control so its cool
[3:42:23] <Prevot> I guess just prepare for people being mad on youtube
[3:42:25] <%Exiliator> I think spending too long looking is also bad
[3:42:38] <OToole42> just play as you play, people need to learn to relax
[3:42:39] <@Solidus_113> The noise comes from where you should look. Are you playing with mono audio? @WoolieVersus
[3:42:39] <Dementedpenguin> Just play the way you've been playing
[3:42:43] <awalr> DansGame
[3:42:47] <Jack_of_No_Trades> finding it organically is best, but often needs multiple playthroughs. Play as you are and enjoy the ones you do find
[3:42:50] <Cypher_Ranger_PhazON> Point of Interest
[3:42:58] <ZeeJiggle> It's part of the experience if you missed something, honestly. You don't need a 100% lore run on the first run
[3:43:01] <Professor_Rakor> I mean, not having headphones for directional hearing doesn't help...but such is the setup.
[3:43:07] <+Knight_Anastasia> !uptime
[3:43:08] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 43 minutes
[3:43:10] <heartlesshealer> Ah, mono explains everything
[3:43:11] <Louie_Salmon> Ah, well fair enough
[3:43:12] <@Solidus_113> Thaaaaaaaaaaaat would explain everything
[3:43:21] <%GeneralSCPatton> You really need directional audio
[3:43:22] <Jathspuh> DansGame
[3:43:24] <natebud> That explains everything
[3:43:28] <serpenttucker> Think of that more as a suggestion that their are mini-scripted events that can occur outside of standard gameplay. Try not to actively look for it, but if there are transparent windows or things like that, chances are there is something you can see going on.
[3:43:30] <Melchior_the_Wise> "YoU'rE NoT pLaYiNg It RiGhT!"
[3:43:32] <awalr> goes through a rube goldberg machine
[3:43:43] <startstoprepeat> this explains literally years of you missing stuff, why have you never explained this before
[3:43:46] <DontChuckle98> You guys thinking of revisiting MK11 with the new dlc characters?
[3:43:48] <Prevot> NotLikeThis
[3:43:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> oooooooh
[3:43:51] <arkv01> 5D streaming
[3:43:52] <%trustycoyote> trustycoyote subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[3:43:56] <%Irridium> this explains so much
[3:43:58] <heartlesshealer> Yeah, there's no way for the guys to record and hear sound as intended
[3:44:00] <+Tr1pkT12> no wonder you had audio back then lol
[3:44:11] <%Vikingdeath1> Its ok, I like Mono
[3:44:13] <+Tr1pkT12> *audio problems
[3:44:24] <%SirGO0SE> oh no I was too late >_<
[3:44:27] <natebud> This explains so much of the DOOM playthrough
[3:44:31] <%GeneralSCPatton> That's a huge OOF
[3:44:35] <serpenttucker> Unfortunately stuff like closed captioning also takes away from the experience
[3:44:39] <Jathspuh> ???
[3:44:40] <Louie_Salmon> Hmm
[3:44:41] <+neuwaive> that's gonna make shooter pretty hard going forward
[3:44:42] <awalr> big disagree
[3:44:47] <natebud> BIG disagree
[3:44:47] <+gustavozxd> big disagree
[3:44:49] <@Solidus_113> Binaural audio has existed for a decade
[3:44:51] <TwinBat> disagree
[3:44:52] <KruelDestiny> big disagree
[3:44:53] <+aceleapc> huge disagree
[3:44:54] <+neuwaive> they use that stuff, especially the slower ones
[3:44:54] <awalr> don't design your video game with video, blind people can't play
[3:44:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> disagree
[3:44:55] <Jack_of_No_Trades> very prevalent in first person
[3:44:56] <Hawkbone_> Its also a remake, so it should have fixed that
[3:44:59] <thewizardchan> Or wear headphones
[3:45:01] <+justianxix> what about horror games?
[3:45:02] <DatAsuna> No it isn't
[3:45:07] <DatAsuna> it's only extra in hellblade
[3:45:08] <%RioGascar> mono audio is kinda gone
[3:45:12] <MurlinDurl> the sequal for hellblade looks sick af
[3:45:17] <Belutima> Surround is a GREAT feature but it shouldn't be necessary woopsISee
[3:45:18] <DatAsuna> progress and events are misssable without it in hellblade
[3:45:18] <%Exiliator> @serpenttucker I'll turn that on anyway, even with expensive headphones Kappa
[3:45:20] <heartlesshealer> Make it extra instead of base need
[3:45:22] <DatAsuna> *aren't
[3:45:32] <Jathspuh> overwatch would be almost unplayable
[3:45:34] <+gustavozxd> eh
[3:45:36] <%Irridium> Yeah deaf people get fucked on that
[3:45:37] <segbas2004> basic accessibility
[3:45:41] <+neuwaive> woolie coming out against the sound puzzle in myst
[3:45:43] <natebud> This is a weird take
[3:45:44] <serpenttucker> @Exiliator Oh I do too, but that is because I am legit losing my hearing
[3:45:44] <DatAsuna> Also yeah Pat needs to do a full tream of hellblade it's rad
[3:45:53] <%SirGO0SE> @Jathspuh overwatch is unplayable :)
[3:45:53] <+neuwaive> "shouldn't need a soundcard to play your game"
[3:45:58] <@Solidus_113> But should be the bottom line for quality. Most people are already wearing basic headphones with 2.0 audio
[3:45:58] <Dementedpenguin> yo I wanna go to that bar
[3:46:03] <+PR0swagonist> Developers don't tend to make games around people that can't hear their game normaller
[3:46:08] <awalr> someone might only have five minutes to read, so don't make your novel larger than two pages
[3:46:09] <Reizie_Etherealm> Basic accessibility should be standard
[3:46:10] <+jiggy_snipe> this is just accessibility stuff. It's like colorblindness
[3:46:12] <Hawkbone_> And if the original had that kinda design, this remake should have rectified that anyway.
[3:46:13] <+gustavozxd> that's limiting the devs ideas though
[3:46:15] <Dementedpenguin> I mean, not now >_>
[3:46:15] <metabot64> !uptime
[3:46:15] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 46 minutes
[3:46:25] <natebud> Why would you want to hear enemies behind you?
[3:46:25] <Shardlab> Most folks play with regular TV speakers
[3:46:26] <Louie_Salmon> I dunno man
[3:46:27] <+MultiTrip> this isn't a strange take at all, this is basic accessibility in design lmao
[3:46:28] <%itmegwimble> Good stereo is super good tho. Like dead space has CRAZY GOOD stereo
[3:46:28] <sexdrugsvideogames> but in first person you need audio to compensate for your blind spots
[3:46:29] <%Javaa01> Surround isn't the thing, but basic two channel stereo audio is the standard, hell, MGS 1 was designed for it where Mono was a failsafe for Psycho Mantia
[3:46:32] <Shardlab> And they suuuuck
[3:46:32] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[3:46:33] <%RioGascar> valve is actually probably the leader in accessibility settings next to riot and epic games
[3:46:34] <Jathspuh> @SirGO0SE you right. just trying to make an example that he'd relate to
[3:46:34] <%Javaa01> Mantis*

[3:46:38] <SuperKirby24> LUL

[3:47:05] <Jack_of_No_Trades> Like an Ace?
[3:47:07] <%FenixSeraph> m-m-m-my Ryona
[3:47:10] <%GeneralSCPatton> @hawkbone_ We're talking about scripted events that you should see, but technically don't have to if you want to be a pleb
[3:47:12] <heartlesshealer> there isn't, but it's how it gets romanized
[3:47:16] <@Solidus_113> Rona is in Ontario
[3:47:18] <+jiggy_snipe> is it like Lowe's and Home Depot?
[3:47:19] <segbas2004> wasn't it sold recently XD
[3:47:19] <arkv01> we got rona in BC too LUL
[3:47:22] <%Exiliator> Ryona: Not as bad as snuff, butyoure getting there!
[3:47:23] <Dg10262> I thought he was saying llorona. Like la llorona
[3:47:23] <worldbrand> there are three in ottawa
[3:47:33] <DatAsuna> That's what Ryona is called that in Senran Kagura
[3:47:34] <Hawkbone_> @GeneralSCPatton We were talking about games being designed around needing surround sound.
[3:47:35] <DatAsuna> *why
[3:47:40] <xeros720> it's often paired with the "gut punch" tag
[3:47:43] <Prevot> funny trivia, IIRC the masochist girl from senran kagura is called ryouna
[3:47:45] <twitchyal> @WoolieVersus The amount of love and respect I have for you Woolie is beyond what I can give.
[3:47:52] <+griffball13> be excellent to each other

[3:49:51] <goose_attack_almanac> The word is actually used. It is not an edit.
[3:49:55] <twitchyal> @WoolieVersus To counter lack of toilet paper debuff try bidet, nothing says happy than truly clean butt.
[3:50:02] <emeraldskrull> The ghost of mahvel
[3:50:03] <worldbrand> i watched hi score girl recently and it made me want to get into fightgames
[3:50:05] <+Tr1pkT12> You saw the Easy Breezy meme
[3:50:12] <@Solidus_113> You stopped at the part is gets real
[3:50:13] <awalr> feel the ladders
[3:50:19] <heartlesshealer> if you try bidet, remember to set it up properly
[3:50:23] <%SirGO0SE> @worldbrand the respect for the fgc in that show is so good
[3:50:29] <xeros720> like literally, still figuring it out
[3:50:34] <%Exiliator> If I had money I would donate and recommend Dorohedoro
[3:50:34] <%Sparkseid> @worldbrand that's awesome
[3:50:43] <MurlinDurl> isnt like valve is working on a new engine anyway Kappa
[3:50:45] <Hawkbone_> It still has Quake and Doom blood running in its veins.
[3:50:46] <%RioGascar> half life was the one that i can argue figured it out
[3:50:48] <xeros720> gibs actually showing up on the ground with detail was amazing
[3:50:48] <laguerrilha> Each 1/3 of the game it changes things up so its always fresh
[3:50:49] <%RioGascar> Kinda
[3:50:55] <heartlesshealer> Q Hayashida does great work
[3:51:02] <Monkeyweed21> If you want a short LP, do Furi. That game was MADE for Woolie
[3:51:05] <OToole42> thanks for the stream guys
[3:51:10] <%Javaa01> Honestly, the layout in the early game is almost a carbon copy of the level layout from 98
[3:51:12] <@Solidus_113> @Monkeyweed21 he's done a lot of Furi
[3:51:14] <Jack_of_No_Trades> Yay!

[3:51:39] <Clowns> I didn't like Furi at all, which surprised me :/
[3:51:42] <arkv01> kotor indefinitely delayed as lil V is making babies LUL
[3:51:49] <twitchyal> I think this is the first time I got to catch a live stream of Woolie's. I never watch livestreams but damn is it weird seeing my favorite fighting games boi live.

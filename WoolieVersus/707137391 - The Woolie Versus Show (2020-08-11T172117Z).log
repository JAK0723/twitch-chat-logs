[0:34:05] <@akuda_bar> black or Black
[0:34:06] <Bluewolf544> Or just... ad dude
[0:34:09] <%harmadill0> What about a person of black?
[0:34:11] <%YakumoYomi> It makes a weird distinction between "white" and "everyone else"
[0:34:13] <+jiggy_snipe> no Woolie you are African American Kappa
[0:34:16] <%derap41> Makes it sound like a disability
[0:34:17] <%doomerskeletor13> Black is fine
[0:34:21] <$tkuwari> Person of Color is weird cause nobody calls White People that
[0:34:22] <%MaSterChiEfin420blntNinjA> And then BIPOC
[0:34:24] <%eriksdrums> People of Colour AND the normals!
[0:34:27] <noe_juan_kanobe> It's so obtuse
[0:34:28] <BenLubar> I'm gonna call you "woolie" if that's okay. I feel like that's an appropriate name to call you.
[0:34:30] <%LastHazzerd> calling an individual POC in casual convo is
[0:34:32] <$tkuwari> It's like saying "non normal"
[0:34:33] <%JustYudha> Patronizing
[0:34:33] <dekubaka> I'm a person of mayonnaise, thank you
[0:34:33] <CrematedCube> It's a bit too formal and pseudo-legal

[0:34:42] <%derap41> Placation?
[0:34:44] <skyheys> It is a little condescending though
[0:34:44] <Bluewolf544> sounds pretentious
[0:34:44] <Polarix64> Old White People calling black people, colored person is fucking weird, despite the NAACP term existing
[0:34:44] <%Lion_kun> Pretentious?
[0:34:44] <%doomerskeletor13> I’ve seen it used as People of Color when you’re referring to a large muliracial group
[0:34:45] <+Lazyjoules> "people of color" makes me feel like an "other"
[0:34:45] <WarKamex> as a Canadian-African-American how do you feel about the term POC
[0:34:47] <%GeneralSCPatton> POC is some tryhard overly PC bullshit. Just use color or ethnic origin as an adjective and be done with it.
[0:34:49] <dekubaka> it's kind of performative
[0:34:50] <%Prevot> it feels really weird the have a term specifically for everyone whos not white
[0:34:50] <%brachydios777> It kinda implies white people as just people which makes it obviously suspect
[0:34:51] <+jiggy_snipe> @ItsDrwOk nope LUL
[0:34:52] <%SvenHolgersson> It puts ALOT of people in the same group for no other reason other than just calling them NOT WHITE
[0:34:54] <%LastHazzerd> Talking segregated
[0:34:55] <JetpackMcQuack> Big broad generalizations are generally shit
[0:34:56] <Bluewolf544> LUL
[0:34:59] <eldragon_1> As a puertorrican, I always found that term weird

[0:35:08] <Snakes_dk> it kinda makes it sound that white is the stadard color lol
[0:35:09] <Bluewolf544> POST RACISM CLARITY
[0:35:09] <skyheys> @brachydios777 THAT, THAT' BAD, EXACTKY
[0:35:14] <%chirochan224> As a person as bi racial, I get so many weird questions and called some odd things
[0:35:14] <%ringabal> Ah yes, passive racism
[0:35:16] <+caskit_case> its like adding the u in color
[0:35:17] <Parapattern> It's overly formal
[0:35:20] <%harmadill0> It's not necessarily condescending but it categorizes people as "different from the default". It defines an out-group
[0:35:21] <CrematedCube> It's an uneasy compromise
[0:35:21] <+Lazyjoules> yeah the language has its place I guess
[0:35:25] <%YakumoYomi> I prefer just to be called "black", quite frankly. "African-American" sounds too "sterile".
[0:35:31] <dekubaka> imo it's important for historical perspective reasons but not, like... a standard address
[0:35:33] <skyheys> @harmadill0 This.

[0:36:03] <%emperordread> POW parking spaces are closer to the store
[0:36:03] <+Wilabeen1997> It has the weird connotation of white and non-white categories
[0:36:08] <+jiggy_snipe> yea just say colored person, we know you want to
[0:36:09] <+linSP> POC is basically a discriminant term in itself
[0:36:11] <%LastHazzerd> Player Of Characters

[0:57:34] <Polarix64> @PhantomMaskJr If you're talking about him reading the Ghost Toad Diary yes he did
[0:57:40] <%brachydios777> @rowencleric Yeah basically
[0:57:47] <%Prevot> that's the famous actor's room, right?
[0:57:47] <+Wilabeen1997> Mario can’t read
[0:57:53] <+regis_j_rock> The Diary was
[0:58:04] <+regis_j_rock> An the Mailbox SP
[0:58:08] <%ringabal> This isn't Rocket Surgery
[0:58:10] <JetpackMcQuack> Mario is a doctor tho
[0:58:10] <%gatorafan> oh no... It's written on English
[0:58:13] <%andrex2311> Dr Mario is a thing?
[0:58:19] <gya0s> is it more or less fucked up that we're looking for a bomber on this train as opposed to the murder we were all expecting?
[0:58:20] <+Wilabeen1997> Only the diary and the pda
[0:58:22] <%BisoromiBear> Mario slipped through the cracks
[0:58:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> Nobody said Mario was a GOOD plumber.
[0:58:30] <restingbones> Plumbing is important work.
[0:58:40] <+caskit_case> mario can only read italian
[0:58:42] <%Theycallmenerf> Mario has a spotty plumbing record
[0:58:43] <JetpackMcQuack> Mario gets his degrees online
[0:58:45] <%SvenHolgersson> Mario probably just clogs toilets for fun
[0:58:46] <DatAsuna> just go to a diploma mill
[0:58:52] <gya0s> I DON'T READ RAT, BOY
[0:58:56] <%TubeMan642> Dr.Mario is technically a different character
[0:59:01] <%gatorafan> Arguably, Mario has done more doctor work than plumbering
[0:59:05] <%Chatterbox1991> -Why does the world outside the train lok like Utah?
[0:59:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> When's the last time you saw that bastard with a plunger?
[0:59:24] <+MarkUriah> He was raised by a Yoshi
[0:59:25] <JetpackMcQuack> Dr Feelgood
[0:59:25] <+ringabal> "To do that, we first need to talk about parallel universes."
[0:59:27] <+Wilabeen1997> Mario got his Doctorate online
[0:59:27] <CrematedCube> He figured it out
[0:59:29] <%Prevot> parents? you mean yoshi?
[0:59:30] <%GenericSoda> mario is an actor
[0:59:35] <dreamfillah> pills just dumped into the sewer
[0:59:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> Mario had no parents Reggie.
[0:59:41] <+NickHatesSnow> He created medicine
[0:59:43] <%ChoculaUltra> I read someone's head canon that Luigi dying from a childhood illness motivated Mario to become a doctor FeelsBadMan
[0:59:45] <dreamfillah> Papa Mario
[0:59:48] <LUvvUcy> luvvucMsMine A clue!
[0:59:49] <%SvenHolgersson> Mario was always a doctor but lost his license and was forced to work for his family's plumbing company
[0:59:52] <%krispen_wa> Good ol' Mario Mario
[0:59:56] <%Theycallmenerf> Mario puts on a white lab coat and says demonic koopas
[0:59:56] <%SvenHolgersson> This is my headcanon
[1:00:04] <%andrex2311> Mario's father is the one from OG Donkey Kong
[1:00:10] <%ringabal> VIOLENCE pulls out a Glock
[1:00:15] <dekubaka> violence ready to SLAP
[1:00:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> Mario is a HOMEOPATHIC doctor.
[1:00:16] <gya0s> "you should just take some shrooms, idk it works for me"
[1:00:21] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Ah A Hat in Time...Il love this game
[1:00:29] <Polarix64> Mario has had been in a lot of different professions throughout his history, plumbing and doctoring is just his most well known ones

[1:11:57] <KatabolicRage> I mean, the entire train is premium
[1:11:57] <CrematedCube> What poor section?
[1:11:58] <%MonsterEnvy> Maybe because Gold Bob is cheap
[1:11:59] <SomersaultJustice> wearing tissue boxes as shoes
[1:12:00] <restingbones> I dont think this train has a "poor" section
[1:12:02] <Robot_Nixon_> D:

[1:12:33] <+linSP> rich people are cheap tho, Scrooge mcduck is a penny pincher
[1:12:35] <restingbones> Or maybe the Scrooge McDucking

[1:16:35] <@Menitta> Oh yeah you can do that
[1:16:35] <Polarix64> Yep that was always a good feature in Paper Mario games
[1:16:36] <%GeneralSCPatton> SURPRISE MOTHERFUCKER
[1:16:36] <straycatrock> in fairness its like never needed
[1:16:36] <Snakes_dk> wow

[1:16:45] <reonome> RESET
[1:16:45] <CrematedCube> Good design

[1:17:07] <@akuda_bar> this game is so fucking user friendly it's shocking
[1:17:09] <GenkoForrest> OHH. I totally didn't know it was Z!!! I knew you could do that in paper mario 64 with the L button.
[1:17:14] <dekubaka> i mean, I knew but i forgot lol
[1:17:16] <Polarix64> Close Call P
[1:17:20] <%bbblaketwitching> looks like a last stand or similar
[1:17:21] <%ringabal> Thanks Chet
[1:17:33] <Polarix64> Pretty sure it's Close Call, might be wrong though
[1:17:35] <+Wilabeen1997> Close call p is that badge
[1:17:39] <+Slattsquatch> Fuck defense, me and my homies hate defense
[1:17:42] <gya0s> kill the goblins. get the baj
[1:17:44] <%SvenHolgersson> Close Call rules
[1:17:48] <%bbblaketwitching> one of the low health effect ones
[1:17:53] <%DarthFreeman> DarthFreeman subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Glad to catch this live, I'm not caught-up with the recordings but do you know about Stylish moves?
[1:17:53] <%Papa_Bearman> Why are the BP rows in multiples of 10 when you can only get 3 at a time?
[1:17:55] <+regis_j_rock> Damage Dodge > Defend Plus imo
[1:18:00] <%ringabal> IS THAT THE RPG MAP
[1:18:09] <noe_juan_kanobe> big number build
[1:18:11] <%eriksdrums> I feel like the age people played this game at is probably linked with them knowing this. If you played it as a kid, you were more likely to press random buttons. If you played it in your 20s, you're much more likely to go "I'm not pressing Z, I know how a text box works"
[1:18:20] <gya0s> this texture pack is awesome.
[1:18:20] <+clapbeat> thats danger mario strats
[1:18:21] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:18:22] <%bbblaketwitching> yes, the build which is best
[1:18:36] <indigo_automaton> @Papa_Bearman 60 divided by 3
[1:18:36] <@akuda_bar> @eriksdrums what does that say about woolie though
[1:18:38] <+marumariball> the evade badges stack up to like 80% miss rate for enemies for danger mario something like that
[1:18:40] <Polarix64> Yep
[1:18:43] <+Wilabeen1997> No no we mean that’s the badge up there
[1:18:43] <SiegeJay> Get it later
[1:18:45] <axelkaspar> Low Life builds in Path of Exile can get REAL strong
[1:18:47] <%bbblaketwitching> as long as its bp its good really
[1:18:47] <+MarkUriah> flurrie?
[1:18:48] <@akuda_bar> time stop
[1:18:49] <PKSomething> Come back later
[1:18:50] <SixthSun2> That's a come back later

[1:18:51] <@Menitta> Oh yeah!
[1:18:51] <%Ancopro> new tech?
[1:18:51] <SiegeJay> You need an upgrade
[1:18:52] <Blunder_Blue> You need timestop
[1:18:52] <Drusain> might be later
[1:18:52] <CrematedCube> Eventually
[1:18:53] <Polarix64> I think it's later
[1:18:53] <+regis_j_rock> Oh that's cool, this HD switch on the gamecube adds some neat stuff
[1:18:53] <%AlexandriasFolly> Get it later
[1:18:58] <Solidnick18> maybe later
[1:18:59] <%doomerskeletor13> Pickle stone
[1:19:00] <Snowfellow> need the pickle stone
[1:19:00] <%eriksdrums> @akuda_bar I've never streamed in front of 700 people, so I can't theorize :P
[1:19:01] <%Papa_Bearman> @indigo_automaton Well, wouldn't it make more sense for them to be in rows of 9?
[1:19:02] <Edible_Enthusiasm> what is that picture on the wall
[1:19:05] <JayEarly> @papa_bearman to cause people like me pain I guess
[1:19:05] <BakerBrute> pickle stone
[1:19:11] <SixthSun2> Mario RPG Map PogChamp
[1:19:11] <%bbblaketwitching> but don't throw shade on builds of greater viability
[1:19:15] <+regis_j_rock> @Edible_Enthusiasm SMRPG world map
[1:19:30] <+Slattsquatch> Danger Mario is nominally supposed to be a glass cannon build but Close Call and Last Stand badges stack so functionally you'll literally never die
[1:19:31] <dekubaka> i remember fucking Suffering i this zone
[1:19:32] <SomersaultJustice> oh wow I never noticed the map
[1:19:33] <%Papa_Bearman> Oh, dude, the map!
[1:19:38] <%Papa_Bearman> That'st he SMRPG map.
[1:19:38] <Drusain> oh yeah that is the mario rpg map
[1:19:41] <SiegeJay> The Picture on the wall is Mario World 2
[1:19:43] <skyheys> it's the smrpg map
[1:19:43] <%LastHazzerd> is that the Squeenix Mario RPG map?
[1:19:44] <+regis_j_rock> Super Mario RPG
[1:19:44] <restingbones> Does Goombella have anything fun to say about this place?
[1:19:44] <Drusain> has to be the texture mod
[1:19:44] <Blunder_Blue> Your HD pack replaced it with the SMRPG map.
[1:19:47] <+regis_j_rock> HD Gamecube thing
[1:19:47] <Polarix64> Yeah it is the world map I think
[1:19:48] <gya0s> Is this another cheeky HD add?
[1:19:56] <%bbblaketwitching> why does that map look so ghostly lol
[1:19:59] <+Wilabeen1997> HD GameCube thing
[1:20:00] <scorpionoutcast> Worst dungeon, let’s go.
[1:20:04] <Polarix64> Could be the HD mod yeah
[1:20:05] <SomersaultJustice> ohhh, it's hd gamecube thing

[1:24:23] <Polarix64> BIG POINTS
[1:24:23] <reonome> has woolie even raised his hp once lol
[1:24:24] <%bbblaketwitching> pretty sure you could use starpoints for that lol
[1:24:27] <CrematedCube> @SiegeJay But yes he does
[1:24:30] <%emperordread> Maximum Overtroll
[1:24:31] <+jiggy_snipe> @GenericSoda I really like the Gambit and Spider-Man themes from Xmen Arcade Revenge so maybe
[1:24:31] <+regis_j_rock> There's one enemy he'll want it for
[1:24:33] <%DarthFreeman> Power Jump, Multibounce
[1:24:35] <straycatrock> at this point in the game i had like 60 HP lmao
[1:24:39] <gya0s> Is this the cell the Goombella meme comes from?
[1:24:44] <+clapbeat> @reonome yeah but then he respecced
[1:24:50] <Blunder_Blue> @SiegeJay I'm trying to think. I think the only thing it'd be useful on is Pokies. Maybe Lakitus show up, though...
[1:24:51] <%DarthFreeman> @WoolieVersus Take off moves you don't use anymore
[1:24:52] <reonome> lmao
[1:25:05] <+regis_j_rock> @Blunder_Blue Spiky Parabuzzy
[1:25:05] <%glass_marcus> Power jump and charge p
[1:25:10] <CrematedCube> Power jump is redundant
[1:25:10] <Polarix64> BIG POINTS FOR BIG BOYS
[1:25:11] <%bbblaketwitching> does power jump exist at this point?
[1:25:24] <phantomsleeves> is seven stars the one that was include on the snes mini
[1:25:24] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:25:30] <%DarthFreeman> Power Jump doesn't really scale very well, as you get better boots
[1:25:32] <CrematedCube> Multibounce it good
[1:25:33] <+Slattsquatch> Flying spiky parabuzzies are the WORST enemies
[1:25:43] <SiegeJay> Does he still need Spike shield Chat?!? VoHiYo
[1:25:52] <SiegeJay> For this chapter?
[1:25:56] <+regis_j_rock> @SiegeJay Yes
[1:26:00] <SiegeJay> Okay
[1:26:00] <dekubaka> for sure
[1:26:08] <%emperordread> Pickle Stone badge
[1:26:08] <gya0s> power bounce is better until you get to truly fuckeracious DEF
[1:26:11] <%ECRead> ECRead subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! Just listened to the podcast, welcome to Teppen Akuma decks. You may have already realized that Raging Demon completely ignores Veil, but if you didn't, now you do! Keep up all the good work!

[1:28:18] <%bbblaketwitching> are there any flurrie situations where its horizontal at the screen?
[1:28:21] <Forkeye> uh oh
[1:28:26] <%eriksdrums> Time Stop

[1:28:35] <skyheys> oh no
[1:28:35] <%LastHazzerd> is this a binary ticker?
[1:28:36] <%GeneralSCPatton> Wait, that does look like binary!
[1:28:40] <dekubaka> chaos control!
[1:28:43] <icebanchou> love how woolie is doing advanced calculus instead of just jumping
[1:28:52] <+AsinPersuasion> typical woolie
[1:28:55] <+MarkUriah> Not saying you are overthinking it but don't overthink it.
[1:29:02] <%bbblaketwitching> I think just flying from green'd do it
[1:29:03] <abelincoln_catpuncher> Woolie VS math
[1:29:04] <Snowfellow> if it was binary then there'd be a point where they all go at once, right?
[1:29:04] <%AlexandriasFolly> Red red green? or red green red?
[1:29:06] <%LastHazzerd> mmm, there's no instance of them all going at once, so probs not
[1:29:07] <+AsinPersuasion> i'm saying you're over thinking it
[1:29:09] <+Slattsquatch> @icebanchou Overanalyzing puzzles aimed at 8 year olds is his thing
[1:29:20] <+AsinPersuasion> TADAAAAAAAAAA

[1:29:58] <%BallerSwagBro9k> *Groose Theme*
[1:29:59] <Forkeye> FASTER!
[1:29:59] <CrematedCube> I think the trick is a one step backwards thing
[1:30:03] <chambatron> go 1-2-3-2-3-4
[1:30:06] <%GeneralSCPatton> I think you have to backtrack before the blue one
[1:30:11] <Drusain> well that's the end of our journey
[1:30:13] <Forkeye> OMG!
[1:30:20] <%bbblaketwitching> Now that the puzzle is over, just use yoshi memer

[1:53:10] <Polarix64> Deph Perception man
[1:53:12] <+AbnormalVoid> too slow
[1:53:21] <+Wilabeen1997> to late
[1:53:24] <marshalmorphino2> It’s like the second area in parasite eve 2
[1:53:24] <Sol_Install> thank you for info chat
[1:53:29] <@akuda_bar> there's apparently unused beta music for the train station https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYw0KH3Ija4
[1:53:34] <%nxflre> yeah no music is creepy but when outside tho
[1:53:34] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:53:39] <%mrjojothelion> he took off power jump thank god
[1:53:40] <%kulmoth> woolieLORE
[1:53:47] <Solidnick18> nice bobbery
[1:53:50] <big_booty_animemilf> still using spin jump on Spinies huh?
[1:53:58] <+regis_j_rock> Really hate to be that guy Woolie but your Regular Jumps OHKO
[1:54:01] <+AbnormalVoid> I wish it had that music
[1:54:02] <%LastHazzerd> ba-ba-ba ba-ba-bobbery
[1:54:04] <%GenericSoda> no butter no oil
[1:54:13] <+AbnormalVoid> it's kinda dull without music
[1:54:14] <Dynablade> think its at the end
[1:54:17] <gya0s> right at the end of your spin. it's tricky.
[1:54:18] <%Cynical_Canadian> @akuda_bar I wonder why they didn't use it, it's suitably creepy
[1:54:24] <%DensityD> woolieFABRICATION
[1:54:29] <CrematedCube> I like the quiet eerieness, it's different from the overbearing gothness of Twilight Town
[1:54:35] <Mr_Strut> That sounds fake
[1:54:36] <+Wilabeen1997> Stylish at the very end of the spin
[1:54:37] <Solidnick18> i didn't know that
[1:54:38] <%GenericSoda> no
[1:54:39] <@akuda_bar> @Cynical_Canadian i dunno, i do like that it's quiet
[1:54:41] <%bbblaketwitching> that beta music sounds fine if a bit too similar to another track I remember
[1:54:42] <+Lazyjoules> IS that a thing??
[1:54:47] <marshalmorphino2> The audience is all bombs for Bobbery
[1:54:50] <+cdrom321> @mrjojothelion What's wrong with Power Bounce?
[1:54:52] <+regis_j_rock> Not real as far as I'm aware
[1:54:52] <%HeroVersusOfficial> woolieONEGUY
[1:54:55] <+Wilabeen1997> No I don’t think so
[1:54:58] <Dynablade> i dont think so, even with timing tutor
[1:55:00] <%Cynical_Canadian> @akuda_bar true, no music works just as well at setting a creepy tone too
[1:55:05] <sunnythedrunk> A case of the one guys
[1:55:11] <%Prevot> woolieONEGUY
[1:55:11] <+cdrom321> Mario RPG had item action commands.
[1:55:11] <heartlesshealer> It's a thing in at least one of the games, but not sure if you need a badge or if it's even this game
[1:55:15] <atomicxdj> woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY
[1:55:17] <%DensityD> items? nah

[1:55:26] <%GenericSoda> woolieONEGUY
[1:55:27] <marshalmorphino2> Find another route in the maze
[1:55:27] <+LastHazzerd> bobbery the builder
[1:55:27] <noe_juan_kanobe> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[1:55:31] <%mrjojothelion> @cdrom321 I meant the first power jump that he got, not power bounce
[1:55:31] <Dynablade> you do, just have to get to the left side of the final split in the maze
[1:55:32] <+Wilabeen1997> You do
[1:55:32] <+twohitgood> another path in the maze?
[1:55:34] <SiegeJay> One guy
[1:55:35] <SixthSun2> Seems you might have missed something
[1:55:36] <%bbblaketwitching> if only there was some way to be vertically higher lol
[1:55:51] <heartlesshealer> yeah, woolie fell right instead of left after the center hole
[1:55:57] <+Wilabeen1997> Up there
[1:56:05] <heartlesshealer> drop hole
[1:56:14] <heartlesshealer> after that do left for new
[1:56:15] <%IncredibleMeh> if only you were tall like your strong handsome brother Luigi Mario
[1:56:17] <heartlesshealer> no
[1:56:20] <Dynablade> left
[1:56:20] <heartlesshealer> jump, then left
[1:56:30] <heartlesshealer> yay
[1:56:33] <+Wilabeen1997> Yep
[1:56:41] <%DensityD> woolieTRASH
[1:56:46] <marshalmorphino2> Neat puzzle
[1:56:47] <%bbblaketwitching> in the trash with spiky joe
[1:56:56] <Polarix64> Right into the trash lol
[1:56:58] <Warbot40> I forget this area exists in this game sometimes.
[1:57:00] <dekubaka> excuse us mr.s spikey
[1:57:08] <+regis_j_rock> Ms. Mowz pierces
[1:57:08] <gya0s> mowz is actually your best bet here
[1:57:14] <CrematedCube> Ms Mowz also pierces defense
[1:57:17] <%bbblaketwitching> because his family just hangs out there for some reason
[1:57:22] <sunnythedrunk> Flykie Joes
[1:57:24] <dekubaka> @warbot40 this zone is totally a liminal space in this game huh
[1:57:30] <SomersaultJustice> ms mowz pierces defense
[1:57:32] <SiegeJay> Dont be talking shit about Joe. He is the best
[1:57:34] <Dynablade> has he ever attacked with ms mowz yet lol
[1:57:37] <marshalmorphino2> Shadow realm
[1:57:41] <+regis_j_rock> Basic Attack
[1:57:42] <Drusain> Her normal attack
[1:57:42] <aliab95> yes
[1:57:43] <%mrjojothelion> she does, with her slap
[1:57:48] <%Prevot> oof
[1:57:49] <skyheys> her slap
[1:57:49] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> normal
[1:57:52] <SiegeJay> Her slaps pierce
[1:57:57] <gya0s> quake?
[1:58:01] <+linSP> slap pierces
[1:58:05] <%Cynical_Canadian> Ms. Mowz has got a STRONG hand
[1:58:06] <CrematedCube> POW?
[1:58:10] <heartlesshealer> it's supposed to be her starting gimmick besides secrets
[1:58:12] <%Papa_Bearman> POW will flip them over!
[1:58:18] <bone_reaper69> It's pointless to use veil after Mario's already gone. He loses his turn if veil is used after Mario goes
[1:58:31] <%ringabal> @WoolieVersus If you Veil before using Mario's turn, you can actually skip the enemy turn
[1:58:45] <SomersaultJustice> LUL
[1:58:48] <noe_juan_kanobe> POW block?
[1:58:59] <%bbblaketwitching> its counter intuitive
[1:58:59] <Polarix64> Yeah Vivian's veil doesn't really work against regular enemies, It's only good against Powered Up Bosses, no Bow's move in 64 is top tier
[1:59:01] <heartlesshealer> multibounce then power shell
[1:59:26] <CrypticMochi> I don’t remember if quake hammer flips them
[1:59:28] <%Papa_Bearman> Flurrie could blow them away, maybe?
[1:59:33] <Warbot40> Why did I never realize ms mowz had piercing. Probably would've used her if I realized that.
[1:59:34] <%chirochan224> Yeah just use Koop
[1:59:34] <bevyrage> quake hammer flips
[1:59:35] <bone_reaper69> veil is such a disappointment since it basically skips one of your turns, or at best vivian loses a turn.
[1:59:44] <%Papa_Bearman> I'd say Earth Tremor at this point.
[1:59:46] <%Prevot> quake damages and flips
[1:59:50] <%DensityD> a few small mistakes, but woolie is good at this game, he's gotten better
[1:59:56] <+regis_j_rock> @Warbot40 tbf It's not super well explained
[1:59:59] <heartlesshealer> oh you re-equipped quake!
[2:00:00] <+Wilabeen1997> So just regular jump I guess
[2:00:03] <gya0s> Veil is really useful situationally, against any enemy that charges
[2:00:04] <+regis_j_rock> You kinda just have to try it
[2:00:06] <%chirochan224> Mario then Koop
[2:00:10] <SiegeJay> @bone_reaper69 Its situational when you need to b avoid a big attack
[2:00:15] <marshalmorphino2> Nice
[2:00:24] <%LastHazzerd> wow, Bobbery is a tank
[2:00:25] <marshalmorphino2> And bobbery can take a hit
[2:00:25] <%DensityD> use it
[2:00:25] <+regis_j_rock> Try Mowz
[2:00:25] <%Cynical_Canadian> With Bobbery out front though, it's not too bad since he's a tank
[2:00:28] <Drusain> Mowz will OHKO anything in this position for examp;e
[2:00:36] <SiegeJay> Use pow
[2:00:36] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1293070990046572547?s=19

[2:10:36] <morphinomarshal> Maybe woolie should have asked for more practice
[2:10:36] <gya0s> man, remember Chuck Quizmo's helper? She's the OG cute Toad.
[2:10:41] <%GenericSoda> oh i guess you dont have the ultra happer
[2:10:45] <morphinomarshal> Wow, like Saitama at the hero selection exam
[2:10:49] <bone_reaper69> it's finnicky, you have to get that animation soon as you hold b or it wont work
[2:10:54] <heartlesshealer> drippy drip tells you where to line up
[2:10:55] <%bbblaketwitching> lol he was doing it mid air?
[2:10:56] <%GenericSoda> @gya0s Vanna T. what a great name
[2:11:00] <chambatron> Below the leak woolie
[2:11:00] <morphinomarshal> you're not lined up Woolie
[2:11:00] <Blunder_Blue> woolz please
[2:11:00] <%ringabal> *sad violin noises*
[2:11:00] <Warbot40> misaligned

[2:11:05] <damienlunas> Z-Axis Woolie
[2:11:05] <SixthSun2> Woolie, please, the tells
[2:11:05] <SomersaultJustice> that drip is there for a reason
[2:11:06] <morphinomarshal> go under the dripping water
[2:11:06] <heartlesshealer> Dripping
[2:11:06] <Polarix64> Nope just bad depth perception Woolie
[2:11:07] <bevyrage> there are marks on the ground woolie
[2:11:08] <KumaTorey> kumato1Sas
[2:11:08] <%mrjojothelion> he will figure it out y'all
[2:11:09] <%Cynical_Canadian> Try the pickle stone perspective woolie
[2:11:09] <morphinomarshal> Look at the driop
[2:11:09] <%Th3SmartAlec> WoolieVs Depth Perception
[2:11:10] <dmac63> PICKLE JUMP
[2:11:10] <Thunderhog> Perspective
[2:11:10] <%Prevot> they're literally showing you
[2:11:11] <+Zenryoku21> woolie vs depth perception
[2:11:11] <%Papa_Bearman> Gosh, Woolie, that pipe looks suspicious, Woolie.
[2:11:11] <%DensityD> depth percetion, check with the wall
[2:11:13] <damienlunas> Look at the pipe dripping
[2:11:13] <%yusefHD> oil
[2:11:14] <SiegeJay> Woolie the leaking pipe
[2:11:14] <CrematedCube> No, depth perception
[2:11:14] <%LastHazzerd> it's not a variable height thing
[2:11:15] <SixthSun2> PERSPECTIVE
[2:11:16] <%bbblaketwitching> if only there was some type of indicator
[2:11:16] <%GreenCMD> DEPTH PERSPECTIVE
[2:11:16] <%GenericSoda> look at the drips
[2:11:17] <+cdrom321> There's no in between.
[2:11:19] <Warbot40> You can't
[2:11:20] <%HeroVersusOfficial> He will figure it out
[2:11:20] <%LastHazzerd> you either go all or nothing
[2:11:21] <+BestTeaMaker> nope
[2:11:22] <Blunder_Blue> You can't.
[2:11:22] <%ozmon> It's binary
[2:11:23] <%andrex2311> can't
[2:11:24] <+psidefx> Sadly
[2:11:24] <%DensityD> game for children
[2:11:25] <morphinomarshal> you can't jump higher
[2:11:25] <PhantomMaskJr> Drip 💧
[2:11:26] <@akuda_bar> doesn't work like that
[2:11:26] <sunnythedrunk> can't
[2:11:26] <hectic_harlequin> You can't
[2:11:27] <shiny_prinny> it's only for jumping straight up
[2:11:27] <heartlesshealer> Stationary only
[2:11:28] <morphinomarshal> it's all or nothing
[2:11:28] <%yusefHD> woolieSHOOK woolieSHOOK
[2:11:29] <TheyCallMeVawn> ????
[2:11:29] <Thunderhog> @WoolieVersus nope, it's up and ONLY up
[2:11:30] <%Cynical_Canadian> It's straight up only
[2:11:31] <hectic_harlequin> Yeah it's just for grabbing
[2:11:32] <damienlunas> It's only for going straight up
[2:11:36] <CrematedCube> Doesn't work like that
[2:11:36] <%nxflre> oh yeah doesnt work like that
[2:11:36] <Polarix64> You can't Woolie
[2:11:38] <+cdrom321> That's not how that works. Only grabbing pipes.
[2:11:41] <%HeroVersusOfficial> No horizontal momentum
[2:11:44] <Warbot40> fair enough
[2:11:44] <CrematedCube> Goes straight up
[2:11:44] <Solidnick18> LUL
[2:11:46] <%bbblaketwitching> only grab or hit
[2:11:48] <%Cynical_Canadian> That'd be cool, but no, it's pure vertical
[2:11:51] <bevyrage> grabbing pipes, hitting platforms, that's it
[2:11:52] <bone_reaper69> @WoolieVersus yeah it purely moves you vertical. cant drift horizontal
[2:11:56] <gya0s> consecutive normal jumps
[2:11:59] <%LastHazzerd> shine spark
[2:12:00] <%DensityD> therefore woolie hates it
[2:12:00] <sunnythedrunk> That would break the game
[2:12:00] <heartlesshealer> SMB2 jump
[2:12:02] <dr_sweets> Hey guys, you can switch partners without pausing using the c-stick! Same with using items
[2:12:08] <%Prevot> I mean toadette just explained to you what it is for
[2:12:13] <Polarix64> No horizontal movement Woolie sorry just Vertical
[2:12:14] <CrematedCube> It is a specialty jump
[2:12:17] <hectic_harlequin> Super has a more traditional super jump
[2:12:19] <SiegeJay> Woolie doesnt Know LUL
[2:12:19] <CrematedCube> not a special jump
[2:12:27] <+regis_j_rock> @dr_sweets I thought that was only 64
[2:12:39] <%bbblaketwitching> @prevot but he mastered it that one time he struggled to pull it off tho, he said so.
[2:12:40] <JetpackMcQuack> In a mario game?
[2:12:46] <%DensityD> well too bad woolington, we can all have what we want, just make do with what you have
[2:12:49] <+Lazyjoules> And his name is Luigi
[2:12:51] <dr_sweets> Didn't they move it to c-stick or d pad in this one?
[2:12:58] <%DensityD> Kappa K a p p a
[2:13:12] <+Wilabeen1997> Maybe ground pound
[2:13:12] <morphinomarshal> ground pound?
[2:13:13] <+regis_j_rock> @dr_sweets The D-Pad one still takes you to the menu, you just start in the Parnter tab
[2:13:14] <Polarix64> Mind Goblins
[2:13:20] <Polarix64> Behind the chest
[2:13:26] <Warbot40> room below?
[2:13:27] <heartlesshealer> lower area is the same room
[2:13:27] <morphinomarshal> Pat could never play this game
[2:13:27] <dr_sweets> Oh, weird
[2:13:30] <%GenericSoda> blow it?
[2:13:30] <gya0s> d-pad < goes straight to the "partners" part of the start menu
[2:13:37] <SixthSun2> Ah, more than one room
[2:13:39] <Polarix64> Downstairs probably
[2:13:45] <+regis_j_rock> 64 has the little menu which is more convenient
[2:13:51] <+linSP> the room downstairs is triggering mouz
[2:13:58] <gya0s> that menu was also buggy, though.
[2:14:06] <morphinomarshal> the key!
[2:14:07] <+regis_j_rock> But not significantly enough where it matters too much
[2:14:07] <heartlesshealer> need your boy
[2:14:12] <Polarix64> Oh yeah it was this room
[2:14:17] <+regis_j_rock> Interesting, that's probably why they got rid of it
[2:14:19] <morphinomarshal> use violence to get to the box
[2:14:23] <Polarix64> She was sniffing the key
[2:14:27] <Thunderhog> Guys chill
[2:14:28] <%Papa_Bearman> You can attack in battle. Not a first strike.
[2:14:29] <dekubaka> you can attack stuff above you
[2:14:30] <morphinomarshal> also check the stairs room with ms meowz again
[2:14:30] <CrematedCube> Yeah, using it in battle is tough
[2:14:33] <%nxflre> its a new attack for jump
[2:14:35] <+cdrom321> It's an attack but not a first strike.
[2:14:42] <gya0s> yeah, it's super nice for QoL, and that's the only reason I can think of to cut it.
[2:14:42] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[2:15:05] <pmmori> do the spring jump underneath it
[2:15:08] <Thunderhog> Use your head dnoSMUG
[2:15:11] <SixthSun2> Use the big brain
[2:15:11] <%DensityD> need time stop and depth perception
[2:15:12] <morphinomarshal> jump into the shelf
[2:15:12] <%IncredibleMeh> just smash your head against the problem
[2:15:14] <gya0s> you need Blooey for this part. You gotta throw him at the key. It's super tight, tho
[2:15:15] <SiegeJay> Woolie doesnt know LUL
[2:15:18] <chambatron> super jump below the platform
[2:15:19] <bevyrage> woolie you have all the tools you need
[2:15:21] <Nomad94> Chat has no faith in woolie
[2:15:22] <+ringabal> BUT I DONT WANNA USE MY HEEEEEEEAD
[2:15:22] <morphinomarshal> super jump from beneath
[2:15:25] <Polarix64> Ty the jump on the box
[2:15:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> Reggie the God
[2:15:29] <%HeroVersusOfficial> Chat let him figure it out
[2:15:29] <Potatoidea> Throw the Pickle Stone at it
[2:15:30] <%bbblaketwitching> it grabs or hits whats above you
[2:15:31] <%Cynical_Canadian> Good job Boss, now that's some lateral thinking!
[2:15:33] <%HeroVersusOfficial> He can do it
[2:15:36] <Polarix64> Yep
[2:15:36] <Potatoidea> Nicce
[2:15:37] <Kirlrik> woolie hates logic
[2:15:37] <heartlesshealer> clap
[2:15:38] <+linSP> Woolie WILL figure it out
[2:15:39] <+jiggy_snipe> CONCUSSION
[2:15:40] <townzzzzz> LUL LUL LUL
[2:15:41] <Polarix64> Reggie got
[2:15:41] <zamzoph> that's using your head SeemsGood
[2:15:41] <morphinomarshal> yay
[2:15:42] <%bread_assassin> Thank God for Reggie.
[2:15:43] <Polarix64> it
[2:15:46] <CrematedCube> Big brain Reggie
[2:15:47] <%DensityD> Mario does Mario things, who knew?
[2:15:48] <morphinomarshal> Big brain reggie
[2:15:50] <@akuda_bar> i love the sad violin when you slam your head on the ceiling
[2:15:50] <%bbblaketwitching> It grabs or hits things above you
[2:15:52] <SeBigBoss> reggie still the best
[2:15:52] <gya0s> paper concussion, feat/ paper Will Smith
[2:15:53] <BlackermanZX> thats dirty
[2:15:56] <bearking05> i fucking love reggie
[2:15:56] <Polarix64> YOU GOT a concussion
[2:16:00] <SomersaultJustice> that jump sold out
[2:16:00] <morphinomarshal> now you can empathize with Whacka
[2:16:01] <+Slattsquatch> Reggie big brain
[2:16:06] <%MasterMushin> Gonna cry about it?
[2:16:08] <Potatoidea> LUL
[2:16:09] <%Th3SmartAlec> #NotMySuperJump
[2:16:10] <skyheys> It's not fake, it's just not horizintal
[2:16:14] <dekubaka> that would be too easy woolie
[2:16:17] <+clapbeat> its basically a key
[2:16:17] <%LastHazzerd> a big jump would require level design that prevents exploits
[2:16:18] <morphinomarshal> check the stairs room again with ms meowz
[2:16:23] <sunnythedrunk> That jump would break the game, you would get over any obstacle

[2:19:12] <%Cynical_Canadian> Just a mini flex
[2:19:21] <Warbot40> I think the sprite flex was the main reason Miyamoto even gave the green light on ttyd
[2:19:22] <dr_sweets> A veritable smorgasbord of sprites
[2:19:23] <%MayorRev> there they go
[2:19:25] <%GeneralSCPatton> Can she even blow that hard?
[2:19:26] <dekubaka> a flexlet, if you will
[2:19:29] <heartlesshealer> just a casual flex

[2:20:42] <+cdrom321> Unrelated, Woolie, but have you ever seen Alien. Like I said, unrelated.
[2:20:44] <Nomad94> Chapter 6 is not my favourite

[2:20:45] <+MarkUriah> You don't understand this chapter build character for..... ResidentSleeper
[2:20:49] <%DensityD> juicy
[2:20:51] <JesusWillikers> Chapter 6 is sick
[2:20:52] <sunnythedrunk> This chapter is one of the less interesting ones
[2:20:55] <Blunder_Blue> You know, I find it incredibly weird that Shy Guys are audience only after having such a big role in PM64.
[2:20:57] <skyheys> Woolie likes it wet?
[2:21:00] <%emperordread> Drier than Ben Shappiro's wife? Kappa

[2:24:56] <RunoEddie> ugh Luigi
[2:24:58] <%doomerskeletor13> Cheer550 apparently the only reason this game even happened is because of the sprite flex. Miyamoto didn’t think the game innovated enough and that it was just a copy of the first Paper Mario. They did a proof of concept showing off just a room with a shit ton of sprites and got approval to continue because of it.
[2:25:01] <gya0s> wait, waht?? an expense account?

[2:36:46] <%brachydios777> Yeah it’s weird
[2:36:49] <%ChoculaUltra> you ever want to get into making content and you hear your own voice and just completely drop the matter entirely?
[2:36:49] <+Aeoneth> It's soo true

[2:37:10] <%krispen_wa> @choculaultra I once wantes to be a voice actor until i heard my voic3
[2:37:13] <%GeneralSCPatton> The acoustics of your own skull are weird and unique. Makes me wonder how anyone ever does an accurate impression.
[2:37:20] <RunoEddie> also, hearing yourself on a slight delay is REALLY disorienting
[2:37:22] <heartlesshealer> hearing your own voice has a tendency to make people pause during their talking
[2:37:39] <CrematedCube> I'm that way about video and photos as well, I know it's stupid but the dysphoria is still there
[2:37:45] <$DensityD> never thought of that Patton, and friends have told me I do a few good impressions

[2:39:20] <%GeneralSCPatton> @runoeddie Dude, VRChat has a bug that causes that if your current avatar has messed up visemes. You will hear yourself echo on a delay if the auto mouth animations are broken. What kind of code even does that?

[2:41:09] <%eanscrale> But Reboot did come back, but at what cost?
[2:41:15] <SomersaultJustice> what if woolie makes that video, and then the good reboot reboot comes out just to spite him?
[2:41:18] <twieetcha> I wonder what other Mario game woolie will do after this? Also is it weird I wanna see him play ape escape?
[2:41:20] <%DensityD> we can hardly ever try to out-feeler woolie
[2:41:32] <%brachydios777> Reboot reboot was GOD AWFUL

[2:42:49] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:42:50] <%Chatterbox1991> Woolie people obviously still cared about Def Jam tho
[2:43:02] <%Chatterbox1991> it's not just the gameplay
[2:43:10] <%DensityD> they just care in passing, they don't really care
[2:43:22] <%jinking79> well their not smart bout it

[2:46:26] <%HeroVersusOfficial> Cheer500 It's also worth mentioning that EX is tied to your techs and such. If you go all 8 gates, you need to be ready to turtle up something fierce. However, taking damage also gives you some EX as well, so the closer you get to death, the more power you can gain. Do you sacrifice all defense, throw away your future, for the immediate power to overcome the present threat?
[2:46:28] <%DensityD> but how do we deal with Dante Devil Trigger Aggro decks?
[2:46:30] <%DensityD> huge damage

[2:47:01] <%derap41> Doesn't mean he can't be wrong
[2:47:04] <%Cynical_Canadian> I tried to find the source on that and couldn't. Youtube claims it's in a 2004 Nintendo Power interview but the only one I found didn't say that

[2:47:39] <%Chatterbox1991> there's something to be said about the crumudgenness og the old guard japanese game devs like Shiggy
[2:47:41] <PhantomMaskJr> Put he was right tho the game is just a cut and paste Paper Mario 1
[2:47:44] <%eriksdrums> @GeneralSCPatton This was early 90s, pretty sure he was the only kid on his block with a nintendo and not enough curiosity to question it
[2:47:44] <%AlexandriasFolly> My cousin wouldn't tell me how to become super saiyan back in the original DBZ Budokai and used that to beat me every time back when I was 10. I hated her for that.
[2:47:47] <%crazycraig134> crazycraig134 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! would you ever check out the new digimon games
[2:47:54] <%LastHazzerd> he's like my grandpa, who see's a thing and thinks "How can my grandson use video games to make this cool?"
[2:48:01] <SomersaultJustice> I mean, this game is basically just Paper Mario 1 but more fleshed out
[2:48:03] <%brachydios777> At least they try
[2:48:12] <morphinomarshal> He likes very milquetoast rpg stories
[2:48:13] <SiegeJay> @phantommaskjr Not a cut and Paste but a Expansion on it
[2:48:19] <%dmcRedgrave> Back when Nintendo was a card game company

[2:48:25] <dr_sweets> @SomersaultJustice what? It's extremely different, aside from gameplay
[2:48:27] <%DensityD> talking about shiggy
[2:48:27] <%doomerskeletor13> He cares more about gameplay and innovation than story really
[2:48:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> It's clear that story is NOT a priority with Shiggy.
[2:48:39] <%emperordread> Star Fox 0 ...
[2:48:40] <Nomad94> who's shiggy?
[2:48:41] <JetpackMcQuack> No ones 100%
[2:48:48] <Potatoidea> Shigeru Miyamoto
[2:48:48] <%DensityD> Shigeru Miyamoto
[2:48:52] <Nomad94> oh, okay
[2:48:53] <@Menitta> there's that Mario Wrestling Volleyball game
[2:48:56] <heartlesshealer> old man
[2:48:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> Are you for serious?
[2:48:59] <%mrjojothelion> oh boy
[2:48:59] <%Chatterbox1991> is Aonuma better about being dynamic with his design philosophy than Shiggy
[2:49:01] <%Chatterbox1991> ?
[2:49:02] <morphinomarshal> Nomad94 sir would you please leave
[2:49:03] <zamzoph> Shiggy Diggy
[2:49:05] <%krispen_wa> The main villain of MHA
[2:49:08] <%derap41> Nerd cred go down
[2:49:09] <Potatoidea> Nvm, Shiggy's actually that smug guy with the bat
[2:49:09] <noe_juan_kanobe> Bruh moment
[2:49:11] <%HeroVersusOfficial> PogChamp500 Of course, that also means that when bullying your opponents, your own EX can be used to mix and beat their tech outs. This is especially true because EX dempsey roll into forward dash will allow you to cross through standing opponents.

[2:49:22] <%DensityD> don't be rude like that @morphinomarshal
[2:49:29] <%doomerskeletor13> Shiggy is the guy who did that “it wasn’t me” somg

[2:50:08] <SiegeJay> CYBER SLEUTH IS GREAT
[2:50:08] <CrematedCube> We needed to fix a tech problem, but we should return shortly
[2:50:10] <%Prevot> I hope they're working on a 3rd Cyber Sleuth, there's a lot they can improve
[2:50:12] <+ZoltanBMagnus> Cyber Sleuth is a pretty good game.
[2:50:13] <Nomad94> The Cole Digimon
[2:50:14] <+crazycraig134> far lol
[2:50:22] <%krispen_wa> a man who has everything to lose can be coerced to do shit he doesnt want to. a man who has nothing will do anything he wants
[2:50:24] <prime_name> I would heavily recommend NOT doing Digimon Next Order for a LP.
[2:50:28] <RunoEddie> Paper Mario isn't even crazy long tho
[2:50:28] <SiegeJay> 9 FOOT TALL WAIFU
[2:50:28] <%doomerskeletor13> I missed the Digimon boat when I was growing up
[2:50:31] <%Prevot> I like CYber Sleuth but I don't know if it would be a good LP
[2:50:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> It's because Digimon are the Champions, Woolie
[2:50:37] <%HeroVersusOfficial> The man who wins is not the man who has the world in his hand, but the man who has thrown away the world in order to become the strongest.
[2:50:37] <%GeneralSCPatton> @lasthazzerd The one who has everything to lose is juat rife with potential shonen flashbacks. You can't ever beat that.
[2:50:39] <%yusefHD> sybaa sluus
[2:50:43] <heartlesshealer> If you liked Summer Wars aesthetic, you'll like parts of Cybersleuth aesthetic
[2:50:45] <morphinomarshal> It's hard for an RPG to stay consistent, TTYD is a rare exception
[2:50:51] <whiteblacklight74> bring minh
[2:50:52] <%eriksdrums> Paper Mario is known to be gold all the way through
[2:50:52] <%Cynical_Canadian> Cyber Sleuth's quality is a bit shakey, especially the localization
[2:51:01] <DatAsuna> It's basically a persona reskin
[2:51:02] <%Cynical_Canadian> But it's a good game overall
[2:51:02] <whiteblacklight74> BRING MINH TL

[3:02:38] <%DensityD> REGGIE WITH BIKE IS NEW LORE
[3:02:38] <%HeroVersusOfficial> The question isn't the willingness to protect, it's the willingness to give up what it takes to take the win. Someone who has things to protect has things they aren't willing to give up to win, someone willing to give it all away is willing to do what it takes to overcome.
[3:02:39] <indigo_automaton> We're trying :(
[3:02:41] <%doomerskeletor13> Everyone should be released who got arrested for that

[3:03:46] <enZymeth> No unwholesome biking Reggie
[3:03:47] <%derap41> You need inside storage never trust outside storage
[3:03:47] <heartlesshealer> Study up on how to properly lock it if you plan to ride it to public places
[3:03:50] <KatabolicRage> bikes are wierd like that, they get stolen all the time but they're considered too low value to waste police time on
[3:03:54] <%brachydios777> “Life is a fucking nightmare” is basically the slogan for America right now
[3:03:54] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:03:55] <SiegeJay> America does not need to fix their shit. We have to stop giving Democrats a free pass because they are your team, Pho-kers
[3:03:57] <+ladomania> public bikes are better than those fucking scooters
[3:03:57] <KatabolicRage> despite how expensive some bikes can get
[3:03:59] <%doomerskeletor13> Oh damn my bikes never been stolen
[3:04:00] <%eriksdrums> Bike was stolen the DAY I moved to Toronto. Literally left it alone for an hour, locked up in front of my building :(

[3:05:47] <Ner234> SourPls
[3:05:48] <Spydurman> I got myself an exercise bike and it's good
[3:05:49] <%GeneralSCPatton> Is a man with nothing to protect going to actively seek out things to give up for more power? Not with nearly as much passion as the man who must protect something and seeks everything else he is willing to sacrifice.

[3:08:46] <%HeroVersusOfficial> The man who is willing to sacrifice everything is often the one willing to protect everyone. Taking a hostage won't stop him from killing the villain. The one willing to sacrifice isn't afraid to cross the line to do what it takes. The hero who has things to protect means he isn't going to cross that line when it comes down to it. That's the cowards way.

[3:17:00] <%GeneralSCPatton> @heroversusofficial We can argue this philosophy all day. There is unlimited media to draw from for inspiration. I spent 5 years embodying a D&D character who was an edgy boi willing to do brutal torture and psychic fear-induced mind-rape for the sake of building a rep and deterring his enemies from ever targetting an ally. Technically, he would probably sacrifice some allies to make good on the threat.

[3:19:00] <RunoEddie> it's almost like this game is easy and people's worries about his build were overreacting
[3:19:03] <SomersaultJustice> woolie built the lazy shell with HIS OWN TWO HANDS
[3:19:03] <morphinomarshal> Well the important thing is the passengers are ok
[3:19:03] <gya0s> second form is uninteresting, tbh

[3:19:22] <noe_juan_kanobe> argument backed by numbers
[3:19:28] <StryfeDragon> It's not bp, it's literally just power bounce and no other reason
[3:19:33] <+regis_j_rock> Jump builds in this game are fucking monstrous, but fun at the same time
[3:19:33] <whiteblacklight74> Final bosses are massive difficulty sñike though
[3:19:34] <twieetcha> Woolie could totally do the pit of 100 trials
[3:19:34] <+CptBritches> You shaved my wife!

[4:01:49] <%ozmon> B y e P e n n i n g t o n
[4:02:02] <damienlunas> but it costs 4 FP
[4:02:02] <%nxflre> requires 4fp tho
[4:02:02] <%DensityD> N I C E
[4:02:03] <+regis_j_rock> P Up D Down is an option
[4:02:06] <Polarix64> HP Plus is nice too
[4:02:13] <%nxflre> how bout hp plus?
[4:02:20] <twieetcha> E X T R A D I P
[4:02:20] <%LastHazzerd> you HAVE been usin' more items recently
[4:02:25] <+cdrom321> W Emblem is nice.
[4:02:29] <Ookamiden02> D U P
[4:02:31] <+AbnormalVoid> LUL
[4:02:33] <Polarix64> Double Dip is pretty nice too as well
[4:02:33] <Dynablade> double dip is probably best for now, you're using a ton of items
[4:02:36] <%DensityD> P-up, D-down = power
[4:02:37] <+Wilabeen1997> Double dip is great for some power rush strats
[4:02:38] <%HeroVersusOfficial> P-up, D-down, because everyone knows Thicker Dreads... means MORE POWER.
[4:02:38] <+regis_j_rock> Also you have Defend Plus P but you're not tanking with your partners
[4:02:55] <%nxflre> pretty lukcy!
[4:03:04] <Drusain> yes
[4:03:21] <Polarix64> Pretty sure yeah
[4:03:22] <%DensityD> is A-lister 120 crowd, or 150 crowd?
[4:03:28] <+regis_j_rock> 150
[4:03:34] <heartlesshealer> or just zap
[4:03:47] <Syrushmx> only on the final area is more useful for double dip
[4:03:51] <%DensityD> does it make items thrown from the audience harder to see?
[4:03:52] <bone_reaper69> cant Goombella help you use 2 items also for 4FP?
[4:03:56] <CrematedCube> I'd pick up some more hp, but that's me
[4:03:59] <%nxflre> Pretty Lucky is really good
[4:04:07] <Polarix64> Getting more FP is always a good thing
[4:04:09] <%LastHazzerd> alright, well, we did just defeat a boss in 2 turns, so chill
[4:04:11] <%ozmon> We're already skipping boss stages, think we're doin well

[4:33:38] <damienlunas> She's in Odyssey though, she gives you moons for achievments
[4:33:41] <%Chatterbox1991> Also Mario Party
[4:33:42] <SixthSun2> Go far right for stuff
[4:33:44] <alephalpha> I think you're forgetting the ancient toad hero
[4:33:46] <scorpionoutcast> Anta ga, suki de, suki sugite...
[4:33:48] <PhantomMaskJr> She’s in Captain Toad and Mario Maker 2 shotoStare
[4:33:50] <heartlesshealer> remember boat room
[4:33:52] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> now all abilities got
[4:33:54] <Dynablade> there's so much to do now
[4:33:57] <Solidnick18> remember the short cuts
[4:34:05] <+Aeoneth> @alephalpha Khaptahn Teeooede
[4:34:13] <heartlesshealer> flower saver P is needed
[4:34:15] <SixthSun2> You don't have P
[4:34:17] <+regis_j_rock> You own Flower Savor, you want P
[4:34:17] <SiegeJay> Chat: Remember we need to go back to LORE RAT after this star
[4:34:19] <+Wilabeen1997> Flower saver p is pretty good
[4:34:19] <Drusain> everything still stacks
[4:34:23] <SixthSun2> There's duplicates
[4:34:25] <TheLemuroid> back out and confirm
[4:34:25] <%Papa_Bearman> You found Flower Saver somewhere ense.
[4:34:27] <+regis_j_rock> Flower Savor's stack
[4:34:28] <Warbot40> I also hate that she's the ONLY explicitly female toad in the modern game now. That's kinda messed up tbh.
[4:34:29] <%Papa_Bearman> *else
[4:34:29] <CrematedCube> We don't have the P version
[4:34:29] <heartlesshealer> Partner flower saver
[4:34:31] <+regis_j_rock> You wanted P
[4:34:31] <%HeroVersusOfficial> Everything stacks
[4:34:32] <Blunder_Blue> More lore is available from the roof rat above Merlon's, by the way.
[4:34:34] <Syrushmx> you can double the effect if you have multiple badges on the same one
[4:34:34] <icebanchou> flower saver p
[4:34:37] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @papa_bearman plans
[4:34:38] <BlackermanZX> they stack remember
[4:34:43] <heartlesshealer> get P
[4:34:43] <Solidnick18> stacks on stacks
[4:34:49] <KatabolicRage> you have the regular one I beleive
[4:34:52] <$Ralfclogs> MOAR LORE PogChamp
[4:34:54] <fuji_92> you have the normal
[4:34:57] <+jiggy_snipe> @Warbot40 maybe they want a reverse Gerudo situation
[4:35:09] <%Ancopro> yup
[4:35:16] <+regis_j_rock> 4 Bp
[4:35:36] <CrematedCube> Theirs are certainly pricier in FP
[4:35:36] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:35:50] <+BestTeaMaker> is it a full day of paper mario today?
[4:35:57] <%The_Timo> Quake Hammer
[4:35:58] <Syrushmx> sort them
[4:35:58] <heartlesshealer> timing tutor I guess
[4:36:03] <+regis_j_rock> Defend Plus P is 5 for something you're not really using
[4:36:03] <%Papa_Bearman> If you're going Jumpman, get rid of Quake Hammer.
[4:36:04] <twieetcha> So hype for jumpman!
[4:36:06] <KatabolicRage> hammer badges have zero use if you equip jumpman
[4:36:08] <Polarix64> Get rid of Defend Plus P
[4:36:09] <+CptBritches> If you do use Jumpman you can take off any hammer badges
[4:36:11] <scorpionoutcast> Has Woolie used Bobbery to break the pillar?
[4:36:14] <%ozmon> VIOLENCE EGGS
[4:36:20] <+regis_j_rock> Also Jumpman makes it so you can't use ANY Hammer attacks
[4:36:36] <%GeneralSCPatton> LORE RAT LORE RAT! woolieLORE RaccAttack *raccoon disguised as rat*
[4:36:43] <%Ancopro> power bounce is SO good
[4:36:53] <+CptBritches> Power Bounce aka the boss melter
[4:36:57] <Polarix64> Power Bounce is fucking good keep that
[4:37:10] <+regis_j_rock> You're not using Defend Plus tho
[4:37:14] <bone_reaper69> I'd lose happy flower
[4:37:18] <%nxflre> Defend PLus can be removed
[4:37:22] <heartlesshealer> maybe defend P
[4:37:24] <%HeroVersusOfficial> You're not using Defend plus all that much, it can go
[4:37:37] <twieetcha> Defend P
[4:37:38] <%Ancopro> trade health for more bp Kappa
[4:37:39] <CrematedCube> I'd drop the Def Plus P since your partners are already pretty tanky
[4:37:42] <%The_Timo> Defend Plus P isn't as strong , pretty expensive
[4:37:46] <+regis_j_rock> If a battle ends in one or two turns why have Defend Plus P?
[4:37:47] <ShiningAxis> Defend plus p is removable for sure
[4:37:48] <KatabolicRage> I'd agree with that defend P isn't that necessary, your partners all have big hp
[4:37:53] <Polarix64> Defend P isn't really needed if you don't put Partners on the front row
[4:37:55] <%ItsDrwOk> I’m fine listening to this music forever honestly
[4:38:00] <dekubaka> happy flower is 1FP per turn
[4:38:02] <+Wilabeen1997> Power bounce is Mario’s best attack
[4:38:13] <+regis_j_rock> Also Defend P lets another Flower Saver badge
[4:38:18] <%HeroVersusOfficial> Defend P isn't worth it when your battles are ending in 2 turns anyways
[4:38:22] <fuji_92> I'd drop defense imo
[4:38:26] <heartlesshealer> flower saver
[4:38:29] <heartlesshealer> no wait
[4:38:31] <heartlesshealer> yeah happy
[4:38:32] <dekubaka> happy flower is 1FP per turn
[4:38:35] <+linSP> This BP system is so good, I wish there was a hard type mod of this game using the unused badges
[4:38:41] <Polarix64> @HeroVersusOfficial This is true
[4:38:44] <twieetcha> Won’t matter, you’ll just level up and get more BP anyway LUL
[4:38:44] <BlackermanZX> did ya buy the badge tho?
[4:38:52] <JetpackMcQuack> kinamaHmm
[4:38:59] <$Ralfclogs> Badges are so cool
[4:39:08] <%i_heart_gaming> @linSP have you played bug fables?
[4:39:19] <+CptBritches> Reggie the biggest brain
[4:39:25] <+regis_j_rock> AYYYYY
[4:39:27] <fuji_92> big brain
[4:39:29] <%Ancopro> look at all thoat bp bb
[4:39:39] <+botchdogg> @linSP There is IIRC, but it isn't as good as the one for 64 that adds new attacks
[4:39:41] <%Papa_Bearman> Get rid of Happy Flower and put FP Plus back on?
[4:39:46] <SethKyu> ice power for more jump coverage?
[4:39:47] <Polarix64> YEAH WALUIGI TIME
[4:39:48] <+linSP> @i_heart_gaming oh did they have a similar badge system?
[4:39:53] <+regis_j_rock> You can get a Flower Savor for Mario too know with some shuffling
[4:39:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> Kids are alright. Trade their helmets for knives
[4:40:01] <heartlesshealer> Ice power I guess
[4:40:01] <fuji_92> WAH
[4:40:03] <heartlesshealer> jump on fire
[4:40:05] <%Papa_Bearman> Oh! Ice Power!
[4:40:08] <twieetcha> Was bug fables a good game?
[4:40:08] <gya0s> power jump actually has a niche in this build, particularly in the next stretch. still disposable, though.
[4:40:15] <%Papa_Bearman> You *might* need Ice Power soon.
[4:40:16] <ShiningAxis> Ice power, so fire enemies don't lock down mario
[4:40:24] <+axamilli> @twieetcha yes
[4:40:30] <dinnydanny777> Mario Iceman Mario
[4:40:31] <SixthSun2> fire enemies aren't always a thing
[4:40:33] <alephalpha> icepower?
[4:40:34] <roguemephilesclone> Charge?
[4:40:34] <noe_juan_kanobe> Appeal? Charge?
[4:40:35] <%HeroVersusOfficial> Ice Power is a good one to have on just in case
[4:40:51] <Warbot40> Bug Fables has a pretty good balance and difficulty options. Doesn't have the Nintendo Polish of course but it's an awesome indie rpg. @twieetcha
[4:40:53] <heartlesshealer> or go for appeals
[4:40:55] <noe_juan_kanobe> Or just save it
[4:40:56] <%HeroVersusOfficial> You don't lose anything for having it and it lets you bounce fire enemies when they pop up
[4:41:01] <+regis_j_rock> Also P-Up, D-Down is still an option
[4:41:06] <+Thatghostpepper> of a different stomp?
[4:41:06] <BlackermanZX> charge p or super appeal yeh
[4:41:09] <Polarix64> Ice Power eventually but maybe not next chapter but probably the chapter after it
[4:41:12] <dinnydanny777> Bugsnax is going to be game of the year
[4:41:16] <%Papa_Bearman> If you run into a fire enemy without the hammer, you're gonna have a bad time.
[4:41:19] <+regis_j_rock> When do you ever Appeal tho?
[4:41:30] <Snowfellow> Power Jump is good for Jumpman for high defense enemies
[4:41:30] <Polarix64> TALKIN BOUT BUGSNAX
[4:41:38] <SethKyu> Chat, does woolie still have effects from merlee?
[4:41:40] <heartlesshealer> to the right in the big water room a new path is reachable now
[4:41:42] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> shortcuts?
[4:41:42] <dinnydanny777> oooowoooooo
[4:41:47] <dinnydanny777> It's Bugsnax
[4:41:49] <%brachydios777> Bugsnax is an existential nightmare
[4:41:57] <dekubaka> @sethkyu hasn't appeared in a while
[4:41:57] <pmmori> yep!
[4:41:59] <Darthkitten_Prime> YEah
[4:41:59] <spardanwarrior> Yep
[4:41:59] <heartlesshealer> Hama/Mudo
[4:41:59] <roguemephilesclone> Visit various wizards.
[4:41:59] <%Papa_Bearman> Mash 'A' a TON.
[4:42:01] <+outer_monologue> Odin
[4:42:02] <fuji_92> yep
[4:42:02] <+regis_j_rock> Yeh
[4:42:02] <Syrushmx> not recommend for bosses
[4:42:03] <ShiningAxis> it's an insta kill but it's not great
[4:42:04] <sunnythedrunk> Yep
[4:42:06] <Solidnick18> hmmmmm
[4:42:11] <noe_juan_kanobe> Must RNG if it's cheP
[4:42:13] <barucafe> i love showstopper
[4:42:15] <Warbot40> That said, some people need to calm down about Bug Fables. It's a good game but some fans are kinda scaring people away from it.
[4:42:17] <SixthSun2> Couple of boat panels you've not done in the sewers @WoolieVersus
[4:42:19] <%Ancopro> Horn Drill
[4:42:19] <CrematedCube> Good for lots of chumps
[4:42:23] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SHEER COLD
[4:42:24] <TheDewdHole> Paper Waluigi??????? WOAH
[4:42:25] <%HeroVersusOfficial> !uptime
[4:42:25] <heartlesshealer> Fissure
[4:42:26] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 42 minutes
[4:42:27] <dekubaka> it's the fissure of paper mario
[4:42:28] <+Wilabeen1997> Insta kill with bad chance of hit
[4:42:31] <alephalpha> instant kills are bsuted in persona Q though
[4:42:32] <Blunder_Blue> It only works on one boss and it's not even a guarantee.
[4:42:32] <Thunderhog> Yep, just insta kill
[4:42:32] <pmmori> the chance of it working is actually rather high
[4:42:39] <%ExpressNode> They made Hama and Mudo skills better in SMT4-A and Persona 5
[4:42:39] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:42:41] <pmmori> i've never had many problems with it
[4:42:42] <%GeneralSCPatton> Gamble kills suck
[4:42:43] <dinnydanny777> Woolie is missing out on the tech of X Accuracy's and Horn Drill
[4:42:43] <fuji_92> mahama and mamudo
[4:42:44] <+BestTeaMaker> Bug Fables also is unfortunately in Dangen's hands, and Dangen is shitty
[4:42:46] <%Prevot> instant kill is always the worst in RPGs
[4:42:49] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I NEVER USED THOSE MOVES IN PERSONA
[4:42:53] <alephalpha> persona q mamudoon and mahamaon basically instantly won every random encounte rin the game
[4:42:55] <townzzzzz> za powha
[4:42:59] <Polarix64> I still need to check out Bug Fables haven't played it yet but it looks good
[4:43:08] <TheDewdHole> Its kinda lame, tbh Woolie. Save the star energy for better stuff
[4:43:12] <%Ancopro> thats the REAL screen clear
[4:43:14] <+pectusumbra> But games where instant kill works are so fun. Etrian Odyssey has some good ones
[4:43:14] <Blunder_Blue> I think Bobbery's thing does up to 10 damage? It's real strong.
[4:43:20] <heartlesshealer> maybe bobbery or koops
[4:43:31] <+Wilabeen1997> Koops and BOBBERY
[4:43:32] <damienlunas> I'm a personal fan of Bobbery
[4:43:32] <Solidnick18> bobbery is one
[4:43:32] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> no
[4:43:33] <CrematedCube> Viv and Bob would be my vote, big damage
[4:43:34] <roguemephilesclone> I own Bug Fables, haven't played it.
[4:43:34] <$Futurecity10> cheer500 Sup Woolie, its Uta-ware-ru-mono. Or every normal person calls it Uta. Its an amazing series that you will never experience because its half visual novel and half FF Tactics. Vn's are a hard nut to crack, but its an amazing series that I hope anyone whose interested in it, give it a try. The first game was remade in the new style and is a blast, and the animes are garbage no one watch them. Cheers.
[4:43:34] <+regis_j_rock> Dodgy is a status effect
[4:43:35] <noe_juan_kanobe> Buffs
[4:43:40] <@akuda_bar> it's only dodge for you, not missing
[4:43:42] <heartlesshealer> dodgy is only mario
[4:43:43] <+Wilabeen1997> Shell Slam pieces defence
[4:43:46] <+regis_j_rock> If you've used a Repel Cape it's the same thing as that
[4:43:47] <sunnythedrunk> At this point the partner buff is better than the ability
[4:43:48] <%chirochan224> Woolie go for Koops as well
[4:43:55] <Polarix64> Go with Bobbery for sure
[4:43:55] <dinnydanny777> Well Mario is pretty dodgy
[4:44:13] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> 10 for 10
[4:44:14] <%ChoculaUltra> SHA-ZIBBY, SHA-ZOOBY
[4:44:16] <+CptBritches> SHA ZOOBY
[4:44:19] <%ozmon> Not to mention it also makes their base attack stronger as well
[4:44:23] <Warbot40> @BestTeaMaker Yeah, haven't heard good things though it sounds like Moonsprout games hasn't been screwed by them so far? idk if there was any sudden news though.
[4:44:26] <%SirGO0SE> yeah bobbery is the more important grab
[4:44:31] <%amaranthos> SHA SNOOFY
[4:44:35] <%Ecchigun> @paladinstarbuster LUL yea
[4:44:37] <%GeneralSCPatton> Aw, no voice for SHA ZOOBY
[4:44:37] <fault_417> Vivian is worth it for the base damage increase alone
[4:44:38] <+Thatghostpepper> @Futurecity10 you saw what they did with tactics in ff14?
[4:44:40] <shiny_prinny> yes there are items that make you dodgy
[4:44:40] <CrematedCube> Yeah, there are tons of hidden spots that are accessible now
[4:44:45] <dinnydanny777> I feel like Mario is being Babidi'd by this guy
[4:44:47] <DatAsuna> Viv's already got her best ability
[4:44:57] <heartlesshealer> so that flower saver P was probably a good investment
[4:44:58] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> 10 fp
[4:44:59] <%ozmon> 40 HP!!
[4:45:00] <%HeroVersusOfficial> 40hp good lort
[4:45:00] <%SirGO0SE> 40
[4:45:00] <BlackermanZX> 40 hp yooo
[4:45:01] <+BestTeaMaker> @Warbot40 there hasn't been news cause dangen lawyers have been stonewalling
[4:45:01] <DatAsuna> she doesn't super need that other one
[4:45:03] <Blunder_Blue> 40 HP Bobbery PogChamp
[4:45:04] <+regis_j_rock> Lol, they're the two most expensive moves in the game
[4:45:05] <%Prevot> CHONKY boy
[4:45:06] <noe_juan_kanobe> Bobbery's a beefcake
[4:45:06] <BlackermanZX> fuckin TANK
[4:45:06] <Solidnick18> what a tank
[4:45:07] <heartlesshealer> WAIT is Veil free now?!?!
[4:45:10] <+Aeoneth> Your Bomb is a tank
[4:45:12] <%nxflre> and MArio is at 15...
[4:45:13] <Polarix64> BEAST MOD BOBBERY
[4:45:16] <%Ancopro> WOOf
[4:45:22] <fuji_92> MEGIDOLAON PogChamp
[4:45:22] <Snowfellow> The Big Nuke
[4:45:22] <Polarix64> *MODE
[4:45:23] <%ozmon> Bobbery the GOAT
[4:45:23] <Blunder_Blue> Guess it's time for more FP, huh Woolie?
[4:45:23] <icebanchou> 40 hp woolie
[4:45:24] <%SirGO0SE> its MURDAH
[4:45:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> CRASH KIRBY
[4:45:26] <dekubaka> atom bomb mode
[4:45:30] <anthonypadron> get more fp
[4:45:33] <+linSP> Vivian’s jinx is still amazing fully powered
[4:45:36] <ozmon> lol 10 FP
[4:45:36] <pmmori> nope
[4:45:37] <+regis_j_rock> @heartlesshealer I think it has a Floor of 1 unfortunately.
[4:45:39] <%Ancopro> 1 hp LUL
[4:45:39] <pmmori> it's only 10 hp
[4:45:43] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> 10 HP
[4:45:43] <+regis_j_rock> Isn't it only 10hp
[4:45:47] <%glass_marcus> BFG
[4:45:47] <bevyrage> bomb squad into bob-omblast detonates the bombs early iirc
[4:45:48] <+OneGorillionDollars> MEGIDOLAON
[4:45:49] <%HeroVersusOfficial> It's a good amount of healing but only because you have like 15hp
[4:45:52] <ShiningAxis> that sucks ass, an mushroom does it's job for much cheaper
[4:45:54] <%Ecchigun> LOL 10 HP??
[4:45:55] <Drusain> It's 10 for 10
[4:46:00] <Polarix64> Is is really only 10 hp jesus that's bad
[4:46:01] <%HeroVersusOfficial> 10 for 10
[4:46:03] <dinnydanny777> A "friendly kiss" mmhmm
[4:46:07] <SixthSun2> @WoolieVersus You can totally get enough shines in the sewers right now, there's two boat panels you've not done
[4:46:07] <+Wilabeen1997> 10 For 10
[4:46:10] <+regis_j_rock> It's a pretty bad skill tbh
[4:46:10] <heartlesshealer> @regis_j_rock Ah okay. Probably for the best. Free attack avoidance would be pretty broken
[4:46:11] <roguemephilesclone> Now use Ms. Mowz in battle. ;)
[4:46:13] <+dvex93> Ms. Mowz was always my least used
[4:46:14] <+linSP> 10 for 10 (all)
[4:46:17] <Solidnick18> that's a i don't want to deal with you
[4:46:21] <anarchistPastry> @WoolieVersus of course its a jump, youre playing Mario
[4:46:23] <damienlunas> Bobbery's is good when just need to get rid of EVERYTHING
[4:46:23] <%Chatterbox1991> Woolie this is why you bump FP
[4:46:25] <sunnythedrunk> Ms Mowz was a rip
[4:46:27] <noe_juan_kanobe> This game needs a balance patch
[4:46:30] <%i_heart_gaming> true true
[4:46:31] <heartlesshealer> Test them on random chumps
[4:46:32] <sunnythedrunk> Vivian next
[4:46:34] <%i_heart_gaming> try them out
[4:46:35] <DatAsuna> ms mowz is pretty awful
[4:46:36] <%2hutown> 330% increase in costs
[4:46:41] <shiny_prinny> ms mows is a straight FP to Health converter
[4:46:41] <roguemephilesclone> It's 10 for 10, not good.
[4:46:43] <%ozmon> Ms. Mowz at least now slap for, 4? 5? Piercing damage
[4:46:44] <+CptBritches> 10 FP for 10 HP is just ridiculously bad
[4:46:45] <BlackermanZX> big brain
[4:46:45] <%Chatterbox1991> -_-
[4:46:46] <%Ancopro> thats the REAL big brain
[4:46:49] <+Wilabeen1997> Bomb-om-bast hits everything for high damage
[4:46:51] <+regis_j_rock> @heartlesshealer Lategame Flower Saver + FP Drain can make something like Multibounce basically cost 0.
[4:46:51] <%SirGO0SE> LET EM KNOW woolieYE
[4:46:53] <Blunder_Blue> But Woolz what if you don't find FP badges.
[4:46:55] <+Zxander93> Only limited number of fp pluse badges though

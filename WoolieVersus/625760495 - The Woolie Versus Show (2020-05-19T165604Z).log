[0:29:26] <ghostspartan80> hands up don't shoot
[0:29:31] <%Reverend_Roscoe> SHAUN!
[0:29:39] <%Irridium> that's not new game + that's available from the jump
[0:29:45] <%Irridium> it was added in an update it's sick as fuck
[0:29:46] <%GrassCannon> I love games that do that
[0:29:48] <BaronVonWidget> the balloon gotta get the balloon
[0:29:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> 20/20/20 mode in Xenoblade 2.
[0:30:00] <%WanderingSwordsman> Won't think about it until a new Quantum Dream game
[0:30:16] <%mikesapartment> that's dumb I need a preset or I'm maxing it out
[0:30:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> The goal is max difficulty.
[0:30:18] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Never forget Cage Woolie. He certainly hasn't forgotten you. He's waiting, bidding his time...to strike
[0:30:24] <%Irridium> It's especially helpful when you gotta finish combat challenges but can't because enemies die so fast because you get HUGE in that game
[0:30:28] <%CaptainPileDriver> the worst part about marvel 2 not being purchasable anywhere anymore is the fact that disney literally own most of the marvel side cast now, like, c'mon, just do it, you won't lose anything
[0:30:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> The official hard is all sliders to max.
[0:30:45] <+jepupu> If the game actually has a nice way to implement dificulty and the gameplay is good, one above normal is almost always my favorite
[0:30:51] <Yummy_Nukes> you could make it an option after beating the game
[0:30:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> I think of it like 20/20/20 mode in Five Nights at Freddies, the hardest difficulty is all sliders being at max setting.
[0:30:58] <+tuchpi> eternal has sliders or is this just a discussion?
[0:31:04] <%GrassCannon> Fire Emblem Three Houses Maddening with no ambush spawns would be great
[0:31:17] <%MyNameIsRasus> Enemy damage, enemy Ai, shit like that
[0:31:36] <%tearfuldevil> i've seen way more in depth stuff than that
[0:31:41] <%tearfuldevil> although for different games
[0:31:48] <%kyh9> There is an “official” hard difficulty in XB2, called Bringer of Chaos
[0:31:50] <Belutima> which game woolie now talking about
[0:31:51] <Belutima> ?
[0:31:59] <%tearfuldevil> Dishonoured 2 has a normal difficulty selector
[0:32:18] <%tearfuldevil> but you can also individually select about every aspect of that, creating a custom difficutly
[0:32:20] <%CaptainPileDriver> yo chat
[0:32:20] <%GeneralSCPatton> Enemy numbers, enemy toughness, health abundance, perfect parry timing
[0:32:27] <+ConLin_Arts_> You know what I mean?
[0:32:32] <+oda_flobunaga> DENUVO on PS4 HYPE
[0:32:33] <+Shikari21> Persona 4 golden has a simple version of that
[0:32:34] <lotharrio> Perfect
[0:32:35] <%Solidnick18> it's cool
[0:32:35] <ghostspartan80> perfect
[0:32:48] <+Shikari21> you can adjust your and enemies health and damage
[0:32:55] <derap41> enemy HP and damage up
[0:33:00] <lotharrio> Damage sponge sucks.
[0:33:01] <%tearfuldevil> iirc if you put all the options to max difficulty in Dishonoured 2 in your custom difficulty, its harder than the normal max diffculty
[0:33:06] <%Shishi1205> Health sponges
[0:33:11] <derap41> More enemies is always better than more HP
[0:33:11] <%CommanderSqueaks> That is actually the worse.
[0:33:14] <MKII> damage sponge difficulty I'd dumb
[0:33:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> got a question for you chat, let's say over the past 2-4 weeks i've rewatched 376 episodes of one piece, is that nuts
[0:33:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> DMC still does difficulty selection the best.
[0:33:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> or is that just sad
[0:33:24] <%MyNameIsRasus> I can never play P5 on Merciless because I think less enemy EXP is fucking bullshit
[0:33:33] <derap41> Speaking of Godlike Godhand eh
[0:33:34] <+ConLin_Arts_> Spongebob Damagepants
[0:33:37] <%Shishi1205> Capcom does that with Monhun too
[0:33:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> Devil May Cry does difficulty better than any other series, don't @ me.
[0:33:42] <ghostspartan80> I prefer high aggression and damage boosts rather than just bullet sponges
[0:33:44] <%kyh9> @derap41 Exactly. Having more enemies you have to figure out how to handle them
[0:33:51] <DXLelouch24> FF7R does it good too on Hard Mode
[0:33:55] <%Reverend_Roscoe> ReggieVS DMC5 when?
[0:33:55] <GarbageNirvana> Yeah hard modes on RPGs which are just you get less number are kinda bullshit
[0:33:57] <+oda_flobunaga> The old Baldur's gate have an interesting difficulty setting... a by the book rule-set difficulty
[0:33:58] <DXLelouch24> enemies got new shit
[0:34:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> JudgementJudgementJudgementJudgementCut
[0:34:25] <Ospreynaitor> hey made it to a stream, all this dmc talk makes me wanna get round to playing it
[0:34:26] <%MyNameIsRasus> fuck'em
[0:34:27] <ihateyouo> PLay The Game
[0:34:28] <%kyh9> Good, Gatekeep more
[0:34:39] <%kyh9> Gatekeeping is good at times
[0:34:40] <izacklok> git gud
[0:34:41] <+tuchpi> LET ME GATEKEEP
[0:34:42] <Yummy_Nukes> GIT GUD
[0:34:43] <%jiggy_snipe> sometimes you went other stuff besides a challenge
[0:34:45] <%tearfuldevil> as long as you don't judge me for cheating to see that combat
[0:34:48] <derap41> The difficulty being there would already gate people out
[0:34:49] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> I don't like story elements gate kept like that though.
[0:34:51] <%tearfuldevil> content
[0:34:51] <%SirGO0SE> gatekeep the gate
[0:34:55] <ghostspartan80> just remember to enjoy the game
[0:34:56] <@Menitta> If you can't get to that content, then you wouldn't be able to beat it
[0:34:57] <ralphfromdk> All of Dark Souls is locked off untill you get good enough :D
[0:35:03] <%tearfuldevil> yes i can?
[0:35:06] <%tearfuldevil> cheat engine on
[0:35:07] <%Shishi1205> you have to earn it
[0:35:08] <%kyh9> If you don't gatekeep, then you're watering down content for the LCD and now you're gatekeeping ME from having good gameplay
[0:35:10] <DXLelouch24> imo FF7R Hard Mode is how rpgs should do harder difficulty going forward
[0:35:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> Bad time
[0:35:26] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:35:27] <+ConLin_Arts_> Kingdom Hearts 2 and 3 on Critical is really fun
[0:35:29] <%MyNameIsRasus> doot doot DOOT doot
[0:35:30] <+Zulos98> Dark Souls 2 adds enemies in NG+, kinda like DMC adding enemies on higher difficulties
[0:35:30] <%SirGO0SE> *have 130 out of my 150 granblue hours on Ferry and it's the fastest easiest john when someone starts losing. was the rest of my message sorry for the rookie mistakes

[0:35:46] <+tuchpi> sans gatekeeping the genocide playthrough LUL
[0:35:53] <+orbitingspecter> orbitingspecter subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:35:58] <lotharrio> If you can't beat Rodin... you put on the super item and do the Kilgore weapon swap to murder him as quick as possible so he doesn't get to dominate you first.
[0:35:59] <%Shishi1205> Rip message
[0:36:03] <+Shikari21> ive never beat sans and idc
[0:36:06] <%jiggy_snipe> lol
[0:36:08] <%SirGO0SE> points across tho
[0:36:09] <Hopit> What does "high tier" mean?
[0:36:17] <MayorRev> Evo winning
[0:36:18] <%Shishi1205> Lancelot is good tho
[0:36:19] <MayorRev> i guess
[0:36:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie loves the trash.
[0:36:20] <+jepupu> High tier is fine. God/broken tier is starting to feel uncomfortable.
[0:36:20] <%kapcommunist> your cvs2 team?
[0:36:20] <@Menitta> I like Q in 3rd strike
[0:36:21] <+JustToWatch> eyepatchwolf mentioned on his podcast that he just beat sans for the first time and it took him 10-15 hours
[0:36:21] <GarbageNirvana> Because they ban all the boss characters
[0:36:24] <%SirGO0SE> ranked high so people even on lower level will johns on it
[0:36:24] <%gatorafan> Woolie always picks the boss character Kappa
[0:36:25] <DXLelouch24> ive never beat Sans on principal, not cause i cant
[0:36:25] <%GrassCannon> I played Weiss/Yukiko for all of BBTAG's lifespan BibleThump
[0:36:27] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @Hopit Super good
[0:36:29] <+mighty_max_t> That Spider-Man MVCI Reality stone infinite was rough for a Spidey fan
[0:36:31] <DXLelouch24> cause i never did Genocide
[0:36:32] <%GenesisKnight> @Hopit High tier means they have favorable match ups against a majority of the cast
[0:36:37] <%gatorafan> Remember those days?
[0:36:37] <Gigigear21 > @Hopit best in game
[0:36:37] <fist_wizard_jay> Jobber Khan
[0:36:40] <+tuchpi> I play Negan in Tekken7 LUL
[0:36:40] <%OldManDeckardCain> didn't woolie play ungalot in granblue LUL
[0:36:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> @dxlelouch24 I couldn't kill a single enemy in Undertale, but I also did it after Pacificist.
[0:36:43] <Hopit> @Reverend_Roscoe ah, thx
[0:36:48] <DedlokPM> @Hopit character is considered strong/a very good pick
[0:36:49] <+ConLin_Arts_> the KH3 Remind Data battles are BIG gatekeeping
[0:36:50] <+oda_flobunaga> Team teirs in Bloodbowl?
[0:36:52] <Ghostbody> Woolie "happens" to pick high tier normally
[0:36:55] <%ChoculaUltra> I love Leona in KOF13, but she's "low tier." Hell, I love everyone in that game.

[0:38:29] <+LionheartedRebel> I mean that's the honest way
[0:38:31] <@Solidus_113> I like Ammy...
[0:38:33] <+GalacticaPhanto> tron BONE
[0:38:33] <%tearfuldevil> dishonoured 2 has easy, medium, hard, very hard, and also custom
[0:38:39] <%SirGO0SE> that game made Task so cool and he was so stupid good haha
[0:38:40] <%NickHatesSnow> Tron is rad
[0:38:44] <Gigigear21 > Woolie plays Darlie Dagger in samurai shodown so i don't think he picks based on high tier or not high tier
[0:38:46] <+Zayasu> same unless i dont like how that character plays
[0:38:57] <+ConLin_Arts_> Wish her game on PS1 wasn't as expensive as it is
[0:38:59] <+Keiyum> x23, she hulk, felicia was my team. Play with your heart and you never lose
[0:38:59] <%SirGO0SE> @Gigigear21 most of the time i see him picking low tier tbh
[0:39:06] <%tearfuldevil> cusotm lets you pick - save model (multiple, one slot, permadeath), whetehr quick access wheel slows time, enemy perception speed, how much enemies look up, how visible leaning is, how much you can lean, sleep dart toxin speed, search persistency, how many guards come for reinforcements, health regen on consumables, enemy damage, how many enemies attack you at once, how often they attack you, how accurate they are at range, how rbave enemies are, how much your mana regens
[0:39:12] <Ospreynaitor> honestly I've been getting into skullgirls recently (thanks woolie for you content) and I accidently chose a really popular and powerful duo
[0:39:13] <+mighty_max_t> Marvel 3 introdced me to Laura and she is now my 2nd fav Marvel character ever
[0:39:18] <+oda_flobunaga> Inferno in SoulCalibur all the way
[0:39:25] <Blank9> when Bionic Commando 2011, to show people story's not all that matters in Bionic Commando games?
[0:39:26] <+ConLin_Arts_> I haven't played much MVC but when I do I wanna have Hsien-Ko in me team
[0:39:29] <MayorRev> me w/ joker
[0:39:35] <MayorRev> smash joker
[0:39:41] <%tearfuldevil> also speed of health/mana elixirs, power of health/mana elixirs, how long enemeis chase you, and how visible you are in light
[0:39:44] <Ospreynaitor> so yeah it's annoying when characters you like are popular/high tier
[0:39:46] <%Shishi1205> A sick Fox is super sick tho
[0:39:50] <%jinking79> if only his own game was good
[0:39:51] <%HollowedIdjit> i played Big Band when he got added and he was my favorite. cut to a few years later.
[0:39:54] <%CommanderSqueaks> That's because you ARE Ryu, Reggie.
[0:39:55] <%SirGO0SE> thats why i enjoy playing them more when they arent top tier
[0:39:59] <lotharrio> Smash, I play Ganondorf.
[0:39:59] <%SirGO0SE> and less mirrors
[0:40:02] <BlackermanZX> I just played Ammy Tron and Zero in vanilla without thinking about tiers
[0:40:04] <%kapcommunist> oh man i bet you think vanilla is tasty too
[0:40:11] <%tearfuldevil> i can't get into skullgirls at all
[0:40:13] <b_4_b0mbs> Have you ever lost interest in videogames since you got older, and what have you've done to renew your interest.
[0:40:37] <%tearfuldevil> although i suck at all fighting games, so PJSalt
[0:40:38] <+ConLin_Arts_> I never did Kappa
[0:40:40] <%jiggy_snipe> Ryu will always be popular
[0:41:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> @b_4_b0mbs I'm not Woolie, but what I did was jump into wild genres that I've never tried before. Why I enjoyed video games as a kid is different than why I enjoy them now, so my tastes in games also changed.
[0:41:10] <Leafboi125> Woolie got me on the Virgil fanclub
[0:41:15] <%SirGO0SE> JAGO ONLY MONSTERS
[0:41:23] <razorgem> OH DEER HahaNyandeer
[0:41:25] <%jinking79> it like the Jago army in early KI days
[0:41:26] <%SirGO0SE> What video games you have? JAGO
[0:41:29] <+UnwoundCaesar70> Scorpion in any MK
[0:41:34] <%MyNameIsRasus> Jago everywhere system
[0:41:40] <+ConLin_Arts_> DMC5 was the first DMC I finished and it made me see why Virgil is so dang cool
[0:41:49] <@Solidus_113> and then they started rotating the cast
[0:41:50] <TheLennster> When SF5 came out there were sooooo many Ryus
[0:42:04] <%RioGascar> was there counters to jago? I feel if you have a hard counter to a free character it might get controversial
[0:42:05] <+DrBunni> thankfully Jago is hot.
[0:42:06] <%Ozymandias555> I don’t think Skullgirls has a problem character outside of MAYBE Peacock if you’re bad at dealing with projectiles.

[0:44:26] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> It's an archetype, not just that one anime
[0:44:27] <lotharrio> Chuunibyou is "8th grader disease." Kids living in made up fantasy worlds.
[0:44:28] <%tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus chuunibyo is a term, not neccesarily a reference to the show

[0:44:56] <AllenDeadman> not a reference woolie, chuunibyo is roughly translated to 8th grade syndrome
[0:44:57] <+DomunDomunDomun> It means being a dumb edgelord kid.
[0:44:57] <%MyNameIsRasus> Delusion disease
[0:44:59] <+eanscrale> Middle school second year syndrome

[0:45:12] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @WoolieVersus Chunni is a delusional person who thnks they have powers
[0:45:13] <derap41> You cheated not only the game, but yourself. You didn't grow. You didn't improve. You took a shortcut and gained nothing. You experienced a hollow victory. Nothing was risked and nothing was gained. It's sad that you don't know the difference.
[0:45:13] <%kyh9> It's about 8th graders who come up with deviant art-self-insert ocs
[0:45:13] <%tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus typically used to describe early teens who have delusions of grandeur
[0:45:13] <arkv01> played too much dragon quest
[0:45:14] <+waterbuddy16> middle schoolers who believe they are a "main character"
[0:45:14] <%SuperKirby24> you believe you have powers LUL
[0:45:15] <+ConLin_Arts_> they think they have magical powers and act like edgelor
[0:45:17] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> People who think the have magic powers and shit because life is boring
[0:45:18] <lotharrio> Pretending to be an anime character.
[0:45:19] <%MyNameIsRasus> exactly
[0:45:20] <NeetKiller> Vergil
[0:45:20] <+eanscrale> Think kids acting like domon kashu
[0:45:21] <%kyh9> YES
[0:45:22] <Yummy_Nukes> EDGELORDS
[0:45:23] <+oda_flobunaga> Cuno de Ruyter
[0:45:26] <DamnJP> Woolie, thanks for years of screaming "play skullgirls" got the game 3 days ago and I'm finally getting into fighting games™
[0:45:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> VERGIL is SO CHUNI
[0:45:34] <%MyNameIsRasus> VERGIL IS SUCH A CHUUNI
[0:45:36] <AllenDeadman> usually you see them naruto running on heards
[0:45:41] <+ConLin_Arts_> Dante as well
[0:45:44] <%FuqBoiSlim> All my middle school chuuni bullshit was exclusively on Google+ so there's zero chance of someone bringing up embarrassing posts from the past to slander me woolieSMUG woolieSMUG woolieSMUG
[0:45:44] <%Shishi1205> V and vergil are chuny
[0:45:54] <%tearfuldevil> im bad at video games
[0:45:56] <+ConLin_Arts_> Dante thinks he's the coolest
[0:46:03] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> I never like that kind of thought, accessibility settings and shit are necessary.
[0:46:06] <+ConLin_Arts_> DMC is just a big Chuuni adventure
[0:46:08] <%RioGascar> All mine are in my head so no one can shame me
[0:46:09] <derap41> Dark Souls has difficulty settings
[0:46:09] <%optimasmaximas> sekiro too hard BabyRage
[0:46:10] <BusterRepukken> so uh will the DOOM be played or what
[0:46:11] <%jiggy_snipe> I wouldn't call it accessibility
[0:46:12] <@Solidus_113> @razorgem There was a Fightin Herds Get Into Fighting Games episode a while ago https://youtu.be/Z4I_ZyV0TGY
[0:46:13] <%chase959> I have streams volume maxed but when he faces away from mic I can hea rat all
[0:46:15] <%SirGO0SE> DansGame
[0:46:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> MAKE DARK SOULS HARDER
[0:46:22] <Ultimatefool> The DARK SOULS of Cooking Mama
[0:46:23] <%FuqBoiSlim> @busterrepukken s o o n
[0:46:25] <razorgem> @Solidus_113 thanks
[0:46:29] <Rykorr> okay cool woolie's streams arent just quiet for me
[0:46:30] <izacklok> dark souls has a difficulty setting its called summoning
[0:46:32] <%Shishi1205> woolieACCIDENT
[0:46:36] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> People trying to gatekeep other people from enjoying the same games as them, it's dumb as hell.
[0:46:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> The key point of Chuni is that they DON'T have the secret dark arts or powers that they imply they have (or they severely overblow them). V and Vergil ARE as powerful as they proclaim, so they're not Chuni. Edgy edgy edgy, but not CHuniedge.
[0:46:38] <Texascourierlive> @ConLin_Arts_ no we just pizza
[0:46:40] <Yummy_Nukes> *unsheathes katana* forgive me master but i must go all out, just this once
[0:46:41] <%kyh9> Accessibility is inputs and outputs, not difficulty
[0:46:43] <nothuzad> izacklok no tis caleld ivnesting in statas V:
[0:46:48] <Rykorr> gatekeeping is good actually
[0:46:49] <derap41> All games should have a "story" difficulty even if that means letting you 1 shot all enemies
[0:46:49] <+oda_flobunaga> Dark Souls has a difficulty setting... its called leveling
[0:46:50] <nothuzad> *stats
[0:46:56] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> @Rykorr "No"
[0:47:10] <%Ozymandias555> Never call difficulty accessibility settings. A quadraplegic is able to beat Sekiro, it’s not like color-blind options
[0:47:13] <%kapcommunist> how dare you make the game you want to make?
[0:47:17] <%Shishi1205> A touhou would be a pay to try game?
[0:47:26] <%FuqBoiSlim> Just summon another player fam there's your easy mode ResidentSleeper
[0:47:28] <%Shishi1205> Like you are not ensured you can end it?
[0:47:30] <%RadicalWeegee> Reminds me of Classic Arcade difficulty games where the Quarter muncher boss appears and you gotta get good to beat it or pay up to outlast it
[0:47:32] <%MyNameIsRasus> @CommanderSqueaks Megumin also has powers. You're gonna try and say she is not a chuuni?
[0:47:38] <derap41> Its all good and there's games enough to go around
[0:47:39] <+NumeroHoowan> Is woolie playing doom?
[0:47:43] <DamnJP> Woolie thanks for screaming "play skullgirls" over the years, I finally got the game 3 days ago and I'm getting into fighting games™ for real now!
[0:47:44] <%tearfuldevil> @kyh9 adding a mode to a game for people who suck at video games makes it more accessible, to a group of people who would otherwise be uninterested
[0:47:54] <%CommanderSqueaks> @mynameisrasus She has explosion powers, but her eyepatch and incantation are super chuni.
[0:48:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> @mynameisrasus Also the arm/leg bandages that don't actually cover any wounds.
[0:48:24] <laguerrilha> @NumeroHoowan nah Animal Crossing

Still the best action game of all time imo. Also FK that guy I enjoy this part because I watch the anime and can only stick around for this

[0:52:43] <%Ozymandias555> Being a matter of uninterest isn’t accessibility rather than an issue of who you’re tailoring the game to. Sometimes, difficulty is part of the point of the game. Earlier Fire Emblems wouldn’t have the same tone without that fear of permalosing characters you love. @tearknack

[0:52:55] <geassguy360> Woolie I seriously recommend rebinding jump and dash and using the Air Control rune in Eternal. It is PARAMOUNT in this game, waaaaaay more so than 2016. Not trying to backseat, but it's super helpful for fully engaging with this game.
[0:53:08] <DamnJP> Mature and Vice
[0:53:13] <laguerrilha> Makoto both looks, sounds and plays great
[0:53:20] <%tearfuldevil> @Ozymandias555 earlier fire emblems had an option to turn detah off though? at elast, the gba ones did, iirc? unless my memory is super failing me?

[0:55:47] <%RioGascar> I find this part also gives me time to wake up since 1PM im usually waking up from a nap after work in the morning
[0:55:50] <%Solidnick18> he is right
[0:55:52] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @WoolieVersus if they don't like the talking, they can watch the anime

[0:57:45] <SlammerMchammer> lmao shut down
[0:57:47] <$SilverRoddo> woolieYE mcquee1Nuke mcquee1Nuke mikeliveCaco
[0:57:50] <+DomunDomunDomun> Gotta say, I like Eternal's map a lot more than 2016's.
[0:57:58] <%Javaa01> Yeah, Exultia is a two part map
[0:58:03] <+captain_elsewhere> oh man this psychadelic ui colorscheme elaW
[0:58:04] <%Javaa01> One half is about getting your kit
[0:58:04] <awalr> @mitchteck you can only use cheats when replaying, he's on his first run through the area
[0:58:08] <%Javaa01> Second half is the real level
[0:58:14] <%lewdskeletor13> Missions are long bois
[0:58:20] <+oda_flobunaga> Some Demons about to get Delt on. sipsipGasm
[0:58:21] <+jake5713> Wait, when do he start Eternal?! Did the vods get deleted?
[0:58:30] <SlammerMchammer> I was wondering that too
[0:58:32] <@Solidus_113> there was one last tuesday
[0:58:32] <DedlokPM> @jake5713 last week.
[0:58:34] <%lewdskeletor13> @jake5713 Last tuesday
[0:58:35] <hat_under_bread> Slayer Gates are probably the best way to git gud.
[0:58:39] <DatAsuna> when's bumper jumper?
[0:58:40] <1matheuw> UV would be actual hell for woolie
[0:58:47] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @jake5713 last week
[0:58:48] <%Shishi1205> Yo
[0:58:53] <@Solidus_113> asuna shut up, your control method is big poop
[0:58:54] <%Shishi1205> We start really good
[0:58:55] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @jake5713 this is session 2
[0:58:59] <moonlitdream> !uptime
[0:58:59] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 59 minutes and 9 seconds
[0:59:00] <Idante_x> nice
[0:59:01] <laguerrilha> nighmare is for who beated the game and got good at it
[0:59:03] <DatAsuna> :P
[0:59:08] <jayukiyo> already better
[0:59:08] <BlackermanZX> Damn woolie inmediately destroyed that thing
[0:59:11] <+frankthetank285> yeah I was about to star nightmare on PC them the put denuvo trash so I uninstalled this trash game
[0:59:14] <%Zebroneath> Gameplay Recommendation: You can map Dash to L3 so you can maintain aiming while dashing.
[0:59:14] <grimshuck> Now i really can't wait for the slayer gate
[0:59:14] <%Solidnick18> alot better
[0:59:15] <%Javaa01> Hey, you learned the cooldown rotation, congrats
[0:59:22] <RunningNGunning> Is there no auto aim for consoles on this game?
[0:59:23] <DatAsuna> Bumper jumper is good you just have to spend more than 5 seconds learning it
[0:59:24] <+jake5713> f****** twitch not sending me the notifications... all right off to watch the first one, bye everyone
[0:59:25] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @jake5713 if you've played the game you didn't miss much, tbh
[0:59:28] <BusterRepukken> @frankthetank285 its not a trash game thou
[0:59:32] <+Shikari21> 666 Viewers LUL
[0:59:36] <%lewdskeletor13> So is this save slot on Ultra Violence now?
[0:59:41] <+Shikari21> aww ruined now
[0:59:44] <+GalacticaPhanto> is the game audio louder than Woolie and Reg or is it just me
[0:59:48] <+frankthetank285> @busterrepukken it is now
[0:59:52] <%tearfuldevil> @jake5713 vods are maybe going away, yeah, cause of their lakc of monetary value for woolie
[0:59:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> @galacticaphanto The mixing sounds fine for me.
[0:59:57] <%RioGascar> Audios balanced i find
[1:00:03] <%lewdskeletor13> You changed the UI color too nice
[1:00:05] <$SilverRoddo> “Don’t know what you’re messing with” mode is hard.
[1:00:07] <CoffeeSlice> THE DARK ARTS
[1:00:10] <ihateyouo> DARK ARTS
[1:00:11] <DatAsuna> Otherwise you just get into the habit of burning in limited mobility
[1:00:13] <%Josef_Stryker> DARK ARTS
[1:00:14] <BusterRepukken> denuvo doesnt ruin the game, quit being overdramatic.
[1:00:22] <%MyNameIsRasus> PSYCHOMANCY IS FUCKING DOPE
[1:00:24] <@Solidus_113> shit's metal
[1:00:26] <+GalacticaPhanto> ok restarted the app it was literally just me
[1:00:37] <+oda_flobunaga> denuvo doesn't ruin the game... just the computer its installed on
[1:00:39] <derap41> Pretty sure the earth is already fucked
[1:00:41] <+frankthetank285> @busterrepukken nope trash now
[1:00:44] <%Shishi1205> Farming humans
[1:00:46] <lotharrio> FINAL blood ritual.
[1:00:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> WHat is this GIANT Transumutation Circle doing here?!
[1:00:47] <derap41> Like the earth is on fire
[1:00:47] <%DappercatEsquire> Final Blood Ritual
[1:00:48] <%Javaa01> Oh yeah, big murder
[1:00:49] <%MyNameIsRasus> ... I wonder
[1:00:54] <ghostspartan80> oh you'll see
[1:00:54] <BusterRepukken> you know what I mean, you had fun playiong the game right?
[1:00:57] <derap41> all of i t is on fire
[1:00:59] <%MyNameIsRasus> yoink
[1:01:00] <BusterRepukken> so is the fun you had previously wrong now?
[1:01:00] <%Shishi1205> Kobe
[1:01:03] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @BusterRepukken for me, it's the principle of the matter. It's a piece of software that wasn't included in the advertised version of the game I preordered
[1:01:05] <ralphfromdk> It's only 60-70 % of earth that is gone right now, still plenty of people to go.
[1:01:06] <%GeneralSCPatton> Summon an even bigger shit
[1:01:08] <+captain_elsewhere> pop
[1:01:09] <Yummy_Nukes> i imagine they'll drag earth into hell or something
[1:01:11] <derap41> That cartoon pop
[1:01:12] <DatAsuna> that sound effect lol
[1:01:14] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> RIP AND TEAR
[1:01:14] <%Solidnick18> good shit
[1:01:15] <+frankthetank285> nope it was ass
[1:01:23] <%lewdskeletor13> Yeah there’s still a lot of humans to munch on
[1:01:26] <BusterRepukken> thats some childish shit lmao
[1:01:32] <%Javaa01> Well, nades for now
[1:01:35] <laguerrilha> dmg
[1:01:37] <%Reveresao> LUL
[1:01:38] <BlackermanZX> flame belch is super important
[1:01:39] <%SirGO0SE> Blood Punch, distant cousin of blood pool
[1:01:40] <1matheuw> they kill
[1:01:42] <%Irridium> "glory kills for the blood punch" is a hell of a sentence
[1:01:47] <Ultimatefool> What do the nades do in Swordmaster
[1:01:51] <awalr> nades falter the big boys
[1:01:52] <%Shishi1205> Armor*
[1:01:56] <%DappercatEsquire> Have they expressed at all that the cartoony shit kind of tonally clashes with the rest of the game at times?
[1:01:59] <randominternetsurfer> am I back now?
[1:02:01] <1matheuw> @Ultimatefool woolie its a grenade
[1:02:07] <derap41> This game is almost a Parody of the first one
[1:02:07] <%Javaa01> The grenades do about as much damage as a blood punch if you land one directly on an enemy, but it won't pop weakpoints like a blood punch does
[1:02:09] <+captain_elsewhere> oh god classic joke Ultimatefool elaKek
[1:02:16] <randominternetsurfer> @woolieversus sorry for being an ass
[1:02:16] <ghostspartan80> nice synthwave filter on that UI
[1:02:17] <DatAsuna> on the podcast yes
[1:02:28] <DDDorsett> kuruD kuruGG
[1:02:30] <@Solidus_113> Kreygasm
[1:02:30] <metabot64> so does the denuvo make this game better?
[1:02:32] <BusterRepukken> how is it a parody
[1:02:34] <+captain_elsewhere> oh man i knew woolie would love the mechs
[1:02:43] <+Neoepochx> This game has such strong art environmental design.
[1:02:46] <%RioGascar> This feels like a cocktease honestly
[1:02:47] <BusterRepukken> people got some rose tinted goggles for 2016
[1:02:54] <%CommanderSqueaks> Industrial sized spiritual torture.
[1:02:56] <%Reveresao> check map
[1:02:58] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @BusterRepukken cuz it's fucking good
[1:02:59] <%Javaa01> Check the map BTW
[1:03:00] <laguerrilha> I want a statue/figure of that mecha
[1:03:04] <%tearfuldevil> @metabot64 he's on ps4, no denuvo
[1:03:08] <randominternetsurfer> Woolie, you are gonna LOVE a certain level or 2.
[1:03:08] <DeathByPoke7> something something pasfic rim
[1:03:11] <awalr> lemme get up in them GUTS
[1:03:13] <ghostspartan80> HUGE GUTS
[1:03:16] <%Reveresao> purple part
[1:03:16] <%lewdskeletor13> This game has a lot of environmental details
[1:03:18] <+Sleepy_Puma> Battle area if you want it
[1:03:21] <%lewdskeletor13> Huge guts
[1:03:24] <%Javaa01> Go back up the spear and look down
[1:03:25] <%FuqBoiSlim> 2016 is still good but I think Eternal is a straight upgrade for me
[1:03:27] <1matheuw> you huge that means you got huge guts
[1:03:30] <randominternetsurfer> @sleepy_puma am I still banned?
[1:03:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> It seems like the main reason Humanity got worked was logistical. It seems like they did alright in 1 on 1s.
[1:03:30] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:03:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> Purple thing on map
[1:03:35] <awalr> schlorp
[1:03:38] <grimshuck> check right for secret encounter
[1:03:39] <%DappercatEsquire> Like a gushers
[1:03:41] <+ConLin_Arts_> BIG SORD
[1:03:41] <BusterRepukken> I can beat 2016 on nightmare with my eyes closed now.
[1:03:43] <%GenesisKnight> Argent Energy
[1:03:43] <%Reveresao> NotLikeThis
[1:03:47] <lotharrio> Is it a sword?
[1:03:49] <%Shishi1205> Pinkish purple is a challenge right?
[1:03:49] <ralphfromdk> Are... we just ignoring that big purple part of the map? :o
[1:03:49] <%WanderingSwordsman> @woolieversus you missed an optional challenge
[1:03:51] <+oda_flobunaga> CRUCI BALLER
[1:03:51] <@Solidus_113> It's Argent
[1:03:55] <%dekkitout> Big ol spear
[1:03:55] <ghostspartan80> going back to Doom 2016 will make you miss that dash
[1:03:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> We vore now
[1:03:59] <%Irridium> it's fine there's fast travel at the end
[1:04:01] <awalr> vore

[1:04:15] <+ConLin_Arts_> LUL
[1:04:16] <%Shishi1205> Its pink
[1:04:18] <MKII> gore nest
[1:04:18] <geassguy360> The purple shit is obnoxious, but its there to make you git gud at air movement. After this level you can avoid it pretty much 100% of the time with skill.
[1:04:19] <%CursedNobleman> @CommanderSqueaks i learned about that game like 2 weeks ago. amazing
[1:04:21] <1matheuw> gosh darn it
[1:04:21] <lotharrio> That was definitely a sword.
[1:04:28] <BlackermanZX> the backdown
[1:04:31] <%FuqBoiSlim> going back to 2016 after eternal is like going back to pokemon red and blue after playing black and white
[1:04:36] <ihateyouo> it was a spear
[1:04:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> @geassguy360 But they give you gud stuff
[1:04:40] <%Reverend_Roscoe> Chat, just let him play
[1:04:46] <+ConLin_Arts_> a BIG LAZER SPEAR
[1:04:46] <randominternetsurfer> @commandersqueaks hello?
[1:04:49] <+oda_flobunaga> @BallerSwagBro9k I was just saying the Crucible is Cruci-baller
[1:04:49] <HRTmonitor> i probably missed the explination, is this pc? do they know about the kernal anti cheat stuff
[1:04:51] <%lewdskeletor13> @fuqboislim Agreed. Feels a lot slower
[1:04:51] <laguerrilha> i like its just respawns you now
[1:04:51] <%Javaa01> Door to your right
[1:04:53] <%gatorafan> Good thing is not like that jump on Black Mesa
[1:04:59] <+ConLin_Arts_> That killed a huge guts demon!!
[1:05:03] <%Solidnick18> did he get the key? or is that later
[1:05:07] <ghostspartan80> don't stress yourself too much on finding all the secrets
[1:05:08] <+GalacticaPhanto> Woolies on ps4 btew
[1:05:09] <%RioGascar> Ps4 version
[1:05:16] <$J0RD4NPR1M3> forward
[1:05:16] <%DappercatEsquire> does the demon have huge guts? y / n
[1:05:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> Can he even get up there at this point?
[1:05:25] <@Solidus_113> straight ahead
[1:05:25] <HRTmonitor> ty! @GalacticaPhanto @RioGascar
[1:05:29] <@Solidus_113> there was a door
[1:05:30] <ihateyouo> vineblind
[1:05:33] <@Solidus_113> you looked at it
[1:05:34] <%Reverend_Roscoe> Bro, chat is just more of a distraction
[1:05:39] <+ConLin_Arts_> sbfpSnip sbfpSnip
[1:05:40] <%Javaa01> @CommanderSqueaks He has to go back around
[1:05:42] <%Reverend_Roscoe> let the man play the game
[1:05:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh hi Mr. Snips, haven't seen you since the Heavy Rain LP.
[1:05:47] <randominternetsurfer> @reverend_roscoe what
[1:05:52] <%Solidnick18> sbfpSnip

[1:06:00] <awalr> big snips
[1:06:04] <megamonmon123> gg reggie
[1:06:05] <%scrublord009> Woolie learning about Djent was funny and I do hope he listens to more of the songs. Also, he did put Animals as Leaders in one podcast before
[1:06:07] <Ultimatefool> @WoolieVersus There's fast travel at the end of every level, so you can always go back for optionals before you leave
[1:06:10] <+mechslayer71> @hrtmonitor do you really think woolie would play on PC? LUL
[1:06:11] <%FuqBoiSlim> the LP tax weighs heavy on woolie's soul...
[1:06:15] <+ConLin_Arts_> LUL
[1:06:20] <ghostspartan80> you can fast travel at the end of every level btw
[1:06:23] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[1:06:24] <%Javaa01> Purple is later
[1:06:25] <%Shishi1205> That's later
[1:06:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> That's a Challenge.
[1:06:26] <%SirGO0SE> mr snipsnip is slacking with these passes going around
[1:06:28] <%Javaa01> Purple is good shit
[1:06:28] <randominternetsurfer> OHHH NOOOOO

[1:06:33] <megamonmon123> purple much later
[1:06:34] <HRTmonitor> @mechslayer71 havent joined in for a bit lol, i didnt doubt it
[1:06:38] <%Shishi1205> Pink is optional challenge
[1:06:39] <%Javaa01> Completing purple gets you 3 weapon points
[1:06:42] <+GalacticaPhanto> Animals as Leaders is so dope. CAFO still thr best
[1:06:43] <%Solidnick18> purple is gonna be fun.
[1:06:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> You want to git gud fast? Do Slayer challenges.
[1:06:54] <DDDorsett> Pink is a Difficult optional challenge
[1:06:55] <+ConLin_Arts_> The green is the Doomslayer's Doom aura where he has been right?
[1:07:04] <%lewdskeletor13> Ye
[1:07:06] <%SuperKirby24> purple is super fun, unironically LUL
[1:07:09] <%Solidnick18> wooo
[1:07:19] <%Shishi1205> Almost
[1:07:21] <%Javaa01> Retry
[1:07:26] <%dekkitout> This just occurred to me- what if the Doom-zords are just Eva'd up giga-demons
[1:07:26] <%Shishi1205> kill 3 souls in 10 secs
[1:07:30] <tanarath> Woolie knows about the kernal-level malware, right?
[1:07:38] <%tearfuldevil> @tanarath he's on ps4
[1:07:40] <@Solidus_113> ez
[1:07:41] <%FuqBoiSlim> @tanarath hes playing on console
[1:07:43] <%Solidnick18> nice
[1:07:44] <%Shishi1205> yes
[1:07:44] <%Josef_Stryker> ez
[1:07:45] <%Javaa01> Yes
[1:07:46] <BlackermanZX> hella nice

[1:07:47] <megamonmon123> gg
[1:07:47] <GarbageNirvana> Those get nuts later
[1:07:49] <%lewdskeletor13> Some of these secret encounters get fucking hard towards the end
[1:07:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yeup
[1:07:51] <%Javaa01> Pink gives you one point
[1:07:52] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @tanarath they talked about it on the podcast and he's on ps4
[1:07:56] <BusterRepukken> holyt shit hes on ps4, this isnt PC, stop asking
[1:08:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> Is he on PS4?
[1:08:10] <ghostspartan80> these are basically tests on how fast you can kill things
[1:08:10] <+ConLin_Arts_> The PC version is FUBAR at the moment
[1:08:18] <geassguy360> that default shotty skin hurts my soul
[1:08:24] <tanarath> I listen to the podcast days after, sorry.
[1:08:25] <megamonmon123> but is he on pc? @busterrepukken
[1:08:27] <%tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus you might want to include an "on ps4" in the title, to stop all the "weoolie, but what about denuvo?" comments
[1:08:35] <+mechslayer71> Do people actually think he would be playing a game on PC that runs well on console? LUL
[1:08:36] <%Irridium> @CommanderSqueaks nah launch Xbone Kappa
[1:08:39] <%Reverend_Roscoe> I feel like there should be a ticker at the bottom addressing peoples FAQs
[1:08:40] <%lewdskeletor13> Bottomless missiles PogChamp
[1:08:41] <1matheuw> are those tapeworms?
[1:08:42] <%Reveresao> The wetness
[1:08:47] <BusterRepukken> @tearknack he literally included PS4 in his tweet about the stream
[1:08:48] <MayorRev> @geassguy360 the throwback one looks pretty good
[1:08:50] <+Ether101_Prime> Look down.
[1:08:51] <BusterRepukken> people cant read
[1:08:51] <geassguy360> Denuvo sucks but I sure as shit aint gonna stop playing because of it
[1:08:52] <%gatorafan> btw, the whole Denuvo thing just got uploaded to Woolie's YT, so you guys can check it out if you are interested
[1:08:54] <%lewdskeletor13> Going through the asshole
[1:08:55] <%Solidnick18> it sucks
[1:08:58] <MayorRev> DENUVO ETERNAl
[1:09:03] <DatAsuna> It's not great
[1:09:03] <+oda_flobunaga> Rule of thumb: never voluntarily install malware... no matter the proprietary cool shit is included in the package
[1:09:05] <%Javaa01> Anti Cheat
[1:09:07] <1matheuw> meathook incoming boys
[1:09:08] <tanarath> Drm/spyware.
[1:09:08] <%tearfuldevil> @BusterRepukken yeah, but a lot of people don't look at the tweets. i don't, for one
[1:09:08] <+ConLin_Arts_> anti cheat
[1:09:12] <%Shishi1205> Flame belch these meat tanks for moar ez armor
[1:09:13] <%FuqBoiSlim> Rootkit Eternal
[1:09:15] <%Solidnick18> big old malware
[1:09:16] <MayorRev> big slaps to that
[1:09:21] <eckskyuucow> Worst part of this mission
[1:09:24] <+ConLin_Arts_> THE ROOTSLAYER
[1:09:25] <+frankthetank285> dooms trash now on PC
[1:09:27] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[1:09:31] <%lewdskeletor13> Sometimes it pays to be a console pleb
[1:09:31] <%DappercatEsquire> Combo your Doom Eternal into Denuvo shit talking
[1:09:31] <%Solidnick18> so we good
[1:09:33] <MayorRev> vrooommmm
[1:09:35] <awalr> if you put your head into the mouth of the demon, you get a video game
[1:09:36] <%Javaa01> @FuqBoiSlim Not a rootkit, those are a different thing
[1:09:37] <DatAsuna> shoulda waited for the siwtch version :P
[1:09:42] <Yummy_Nukes> BETHESDA PLS
[1:09:44] <DedlokPM> @tanarath Oh no. They are totally not away of the kernel level denuevo thing at all. That video on the youtube channel called "Doomnuevo" is a total fabrication and lie.
[1:09:44] <megamonmon123> thank you woolie
[1:09:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> When most Antivirus programs identify your shit as malware, maybe you should fix your fucking program.
[1:09:46] <MayorRev> Console chads win again
[1:09:50] <+DesertPenguin> FYI, Woolie doesn't have PS4 Pro
[1:09:52] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @FuqBoiSlim it's not a root kit, it's kernel level
[1:09:53] <+frankthetank285> yup
[1:09:54] <MayorRev> Root and Kit, until it is done
[1:09:58] <nothuzad> its nto a root kit
[1:10:01] <lotharrio> PC es 4?
[1:10:03] <%Javaa01> No it's not
[1:10:04] <%SirGO0SE> Gotta bust out that burner PC
[1:10:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> Rootkit is not Kernel.
[1:10:11] <%Javaa01> It only runs when the game runs
[1:10:14] <geassguy360> it only runs when you boot the game, not start up
[1:10:15] <%Solidnick18> Yep
[1:10:15] <%allups> no its for DRM
[1:10:15] <@Solidus_113> Nobody's been talking about the gore tech in this game, you blow off so much armour and skin and see the demon bones
[1:10:17] <%FuqBoiSlim> @reverend_roscoe I thought it was something lime SF5 my bad
[1:10:20] <DatAsuna> well the MP is gonna be invaders in your SP
[1:10:23] <+frankthetank285> multiplayer is fucking trash
[1:10:24] <%Shishi1205> Did something get bugged?
[1:10:24] <tanarath> Kernal is worse.
[1:10:25] <+BoondockJoker> why put anti cheat for dead multiplayer lmao
[1:10:26] <laguerrilha> Multiplayer i fun, but cheating wasnt really a problem
[1:10:28] <shin_marx> Bethesda being Bethesda
[1:10:28] <+ConLin_Arts_> The original PS4 is still good, Pro gives a boost but most games run pretty well on the original
[1:10:30] <%dekkitout> But anyways- this track bops~
[1:10:30] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:10:32] <%Irridium> not only that, but it's also for the progression system which is still in the single-player
[1:10:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> It doesn't run when your computer starts, it runs when the game runs, but it does require kernel-level access to run.
[1:10:32] <%Javaa01> Also, it's gonna be optional later this week
[1:10:33] <Torgue_1> It's DRM and Anti-Cheat
[1:10:36] <awalr> yeah this area is kind of fucked when you miss a chump and it's still locked
[1:10:36] <DatAsuna> so it's gonna be a dark souls/RE6 invasion thing
[1:10:38] <1matheuw> cant jump on goop
[1:10:38] <DeathByPoke7> One Demon
[1:10:41] <%tearfuldevil> @Solidus_113 its on the level with re2 goesplosions, its great
[1:10:41] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @FuqBoiSlim no, not quite, but it super fucks with your performance
[1:10:43] <ihateyouo> no he's not working
[1:10:45] <+mechslayer71> Pat literally went out of his way to say it only runs when the games on
[1:10:50] <%lewdskeletor13> The demon is hiding
[1:10:52] <%Solidnick18> the anti speed run goop
[1:10:54] <+FennecZephyr> @WoolieVersus That's not entirely correct. As far as I can tell, it only runs when the game runs
[1:10:54] <%allups> multiplayer invaders are not in the game
[1:11:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> It doesn't run at computer start, it runs when the game runs, but it DOES require kernel-level access when it does run.
[1:11:09] <DatAsuna> yeah it's coming in an update
[1:11:11] <+FennecZephyr> And yeah, Pat clarified that too
[1:11:17] <+ConLin_Arts_> What is the coolest name, Doomslayer or Doomguy?
[1:11:18] <geassguy360> Dash needs and jump need to be liberated from the face buttons bruh.

[1:11:40] <raveous> that's fucked on nightmare
[1:11:40] <laguerrilha> yeah for player invaders i get the anti cheat. but the multiplayer matches never had that problem
[1:11:41] <%Solidnick18> yeah reggie
[1:11:42] <+NumeroHoowan> Meathook slaps so damn hard
[1:11:42] <+TechnoSyndrome> Yeah it's not Valorant bad, it only runs when the game is running. It sucks but lots of games do that for anti-cheat unfortunately. The scummy thing is only patching that in months after launch
[1:11:43] <unit24> ironically that was by far the fastest woolie has killed an arachnotron
[1:11:44] <%lewdskeletor13> Oh yeah this part was interesting
[1:11:53] <%Javaa01> Dashing does nothing in the goop
[1:12:02] <%Javaa01> Other then give you the visual effect
[1:12:02] <DeathByPoke7> wheres woolie all i see is darlington the demon slayer
[1:12:05] <jayukiyo> I'm glad this goop isnt in much of the game
[1:12:08] <toomuchsnarf> No goop dash
[1:12:10] <%Shishi1205> Speedruners bypassing this shit is the best
[1:12:12] <shin_marx> didn't enjoy the goop
[1:12:16] <ihateyouo> splorch
[1:12:19] <@Solidus_113> look at that

[1:12:28] <ghostspartan80> some good foley
[1:12:30] <shin_marx> thankfully there's very few goop in the game
[1:12:34] <@Solidus_113> those solidified corpses
[1:12:34] <1matheuw> redkirbo is unamused by purple goop
[1:12:36] <%lewdskeletor13> Gwyneth Paltrow get your goop outta here
[1:12:36] <%Solidnick18> nope
[1:12:42] <+captain_elsewhere> so weird a game all about momentum has these weird roadblocks elaHmm
[1:12:42] <%FuqBoiSlim> they got purple stuff but wheres the sunny d? MiniK
[1:12:43] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus Tentacles in goop only show up when there are bubbles around
[1:12:45] <%Reverend_Roscoe> I think the goop was a poor design choice
[1:12:47] <geassguy360> I love jumping around and over it in Arc Complex tbh
[1:12:49] <%Javaa01> They have a consistent visual tell
[1:12:53] <%GenesisKnight> Doom Mechs are the sickest thing
[1:12:57] <raveous> is that a rabbit helmet
[1:13:05] <%dekkitout> I need a Doom-zord in my life

[1:18:57] <geassguy360> except like dune, which 40k is offbrand of
[1:18:59] <%GoldeNOVA> Doomguy can beat a Primarch, probably
[1:19:12] <1matheuw> hmmm
[1:19:17] <addzy21> Not Horus though.
[1:19:19] <GarouSSB> atpQuan
[1:19:22] <%lewdskeletor13> Who could this Dark One be
[1:19:25] <@Solidus_113> Doomguy is the Emperor of Man
[1:19:29] <randominternetsurfer> hello?
[1:19:32] <jevichrono> DA DARKLINGTON GAEMS
[1:19:33] <%GoldeNOVA> Horus has huge guts
[1:19:34] <+captain_elsewhere> didnt angron take a mountain falling on him ? elaHmm
[1:19:37] <%Javaa01> @Shishi1205 UV is the universally accepted normal difficulty due to it's function in the original Doom, where every difficulty under that cut the enemy count of a map, UV included the designer intended enemy counts
[1:19:42] <%kapcommunist> i wish this was the real bible
[1:19:45] <1matheuw> hmmm
[1:19:46] <jevichrono> Still on the hype from Dokapon
[1:19:53] <$J0RD4NPR1M3> view image
[1:19:57] <jevichrono> Woolie really hitting the strides
[1:19:59] <addzy21> Dokapon was amazinv
[1:20:02] <1matheuw> dont forget image bois
[1:20:02] <jevichrono> Also VIEW IMAGE
[1:20:05] <%lewdskeletor13> Scary Dark One gonna fuck up the angels
[1:20:05] <Kidbizzaro> The next game better be Doom 40K.
[1:20:07] <geassguy360> Doomguy's current power is will based, he would be fine in the warp
[1:20:13] <+captain_elsewhere> was it doom guy that made abbadon armless elaHmm
[1:20:14] <ralphfromdk> yes... "holy"....
[1:20:15] <addzy21> Minh killing it at the end. True hero
[1:20:18] <@Solidus_113> They're the one you saw in that first cutscene
[1:20:21] <%GeneralSCPatton> YEYEYE VIEW THAT SICK ART
[1:20:23] <%Shishi1205> UV is the intended one, not really "normal" by usual standards
[1:20:33] <jevichrono> Too bad the doom slayer will also be manipulated
[1:20:34] <%WanderingSwordsman> She's the Archangel Micheal
[1:20:40] <jevichrono> in 40k
[1:20:41] <addzy21> UV would have been better.
[1:20:41] <Yummy_Nukes> urdak is up, hell is down
[1:20:46] <megamonmon123> isnt it like how intended halo play is also on hard?
[1:20:48] <laguerrilha> To be fair everything is a rip off of 40k that is a rip of of 90s comics/pop culture
[1:20:51] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @ergothgaming
[1:20:53] <%Shishi1205> He can change the difficulty
[1:20:54] <%Theycallmenerf> PogChamp
[1:20:57] <%Shishi1205> If he wants to
[1:21:01] <jevichrono> he and Khorne will be sporting hateboners through out eternity
[1:21:03] <%Javaa01> I mean, there's already plenty of 40k influence in this game, hell, the hunters are based off of a Nekron unit
[1:21:09] <dfs_k> the game is going to get a lot more difficult going forward anyway
[1:21:10] <+Neoepochx> Urdak means "Roof" in Hebrew
[1:21:22] <toomuchsnarf> Yeah each level turns it up a notch
[1:21:23] <@Solidus_113> looks a bit like your base
[1:21:26] <ergothgaming> Never forget that Angron sent off his Legion because someone hit him with a truck
[1:21:27] <%dekkitout> Like that one Parallel Works in Gurren Lagann
[1:21:28] <%GeneralSCPatton> Yo that's rad
[1:21:34] <mdkcde> SPACE CATHEDRALS
[1:21:35] <1matheuw> spoilers
[1:21:39] <%mikesapartment> this a damn novel
[1:21:39] <geassguy360> or the Strogg, the Doom Hunter is more likely inspired by them cause ya know, id.
[1:21:42] <mdkcde> = OFF BRAND 40k
[1:21:43] <%lewdskeletor13> It’ll all make sense eventually
[1:21:46] <1matheuw> look at the game spoiling weapons
[1:21:50] <jevichrono> I can't wait for the new intro for this on the Anime
[1:21:56] <laguerrilha> i forgot the tips spoil mechanics LUL
[1:22:13] <laguerrilha> but its fine
[1:22:15] <megamonmon123> they heard about ice grenade already, its cool
[1:22:23] <%Theycallmenerf> LUL
[1:22:27] <zer0enixx> I don’t know if it’s just me, but the stream keeps pausing
[1:22:32] <jevichrono> We need an updated version of the "ARE YOU PLAYING THOSE DEBIL GAMES"

[1:42:18] <Yummy_Nukes> yeah it was dragged to hell
[1:42:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Hell ABSORBS OTHER WORLDS
[1:42:29] <+DesertPenguin> Hell is Dark SOuls 3?
[1:42:30] <+CptnCampy61> Hell absorbed it from the sentinels
[1:42:37] <+Truebluemc> it used to belong to the night sentinels
[1:42:37] <@Solidus_113> Like what happened with Deimos in Doom
[1:42:48] <GarbageNirvana> It's some big Shao Kahn realm merging shit
[1:42:54] <%RioGascar> it was absorbed by hell woolie, thats why he says his thing about his people paying tribute
[1:43:11] <cstro> oh wow finally came on time for the manga
[1:43:15] <%RioGascar> which earth is next on the cutting room i guess
[1:43:22] <+DesertPenguin> So much lore
[1:43:30] <@Solidus_113> FeelsBadMan
[1:43:34] <haisho> he wanted his BOI back
[1:43:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SATAAAAAAAAN
[1:43:38] <Tha_Mik> ZEUS
[1:43:39] <%mighty_max_t> Kratos but guilt-ridden

[1:43:41] <ergothgaming> For the BOY
[1:43:42] <%lewdskeletor13> FeelsRainMan
[1:43:44] <+DesertPenguin> It wasn't his fault though, his son died and they took his soul
[1:43:45] <Tucker0603> BOI
[1:43:47] <%Javaa01> The BOI grew up big tho
[1:43:52] <chambatron> He did it for the gram
[1:43:55] <venomfury86> GIVE ME BACK MY SON!
[1:43:55] <%Javaa01> To become the BIGGEST BOI
[1:43:57] <chambatron> Bitches love the gram

[1:44:03] <@Solidus_113> A choir of actual heavy metal singers
[1:44:08] <+Aeoneth> KAR - EN
[1:44:08] <RogueMinja> Boi.
[1:44:09] <%Solidnick18> you missed it
[1:44:11] <%DappercatEsquire> Goofus betrays his people to get his son back. Gallant kills Goofus's resurrected 80' tall son to save Earth.
[1:44:12] <%Shishi1205> Secret is outside
[1:44:12] <ergothgaming> The longer the BOY remains on Earth the more powerful he becomes
[1:44:14] <%tearfuldevil> no it isn't
[1:44:15] <%Reveresao> F
[1:44:17] <+mechslayer71> @desertpenguin He could’ve just, you know, NOT TRUSTED THE LITERAL FUCKING DEMONS
[1:44:17] <%FuqBoiSlim> Is this a God Of War reference????
[1:44:24] <%WanderingSwordsman> In 2016 it also state that his son was resurrected as the Icon of Sin
[1:44:26] <%Solidnick18> you went in and missed it
[1:44:37] <%Javaa01> Yeah, you missed the secret
[1:44:39] <ghostspartan80> it isnt here
[1:44:39] <+DesertPenguin> @mechslayer71 basically
[1:44:41] <%Javaa01> It's not in this room
[1:44:44] <+gibbityhibbity> You were just supposed to jump to that platform from the previous room
[1:44:47] <1matheuw> go foward
[1:45:00] <indigo_automaton> Imagine Doomslayer with the Leviathan Axe
[1:45:02] <+OmegaWeltall> Not Kratos, the va is a guy named Kyle Chapple
[1:45:03] <%Shishi1205> The platform is outside this room
[1:45:04] <+mechslayer71> @desertpenguin but his backstory IS sad
[1:45:04] <Yummy_Nukes> woolie will figure it out
[1:45:05] <Tha_Mik> Oh it was at the entrance?
[1:45:10] <DDDorsett> Yes
[1:45:14] <venomfury86> you get fast travel anyway
[1:45:16] <%mighty_max_t> @BallerSwagBro9k tbh, i only know GOW ps4 and heard about how Kratos blamed everyone else before hand. My b
[1:45:17] <ergothgaming> @WoolieVersus You can backtrack through the level right before the end, so you don't need to worry too much
[1:45:18] <ralphfromdk> It's just a Toy, you can come back later
[1:45:18] <DDDorsett> It was at the entrance
[1:45:30] <%Javaa01> It's not over here
[1:45:34] <%Javaa01> You went past it long ago
[1:45:45] <ghostspartan80> its not in this room
[1:45:56] <DDDorsett> Yeah
[1:45:56] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:45:57] <venomfury86> yes
[1:45:57] <%Solidnick18> it was in the other room
[1:46:00] <%Javaa01> It's directly above you
[1:46:03] <%RioGascar> Woolie should mention when using a mini map the direction you are facing will be the direction doomguy faces on your mini map when you pause it.
[1:46:03] <%lewdskeletor13> breebuLore
[1:46:11] <%tearfuldevil> it isn't
[1:46:11] <%Javaa01> It's not inside the room
[1:46:11] <@Solidus_113> it's not in the room
[1:46:16] <%Shishi1205> barely outside
[1:46:23] <megamonmon123> its not in the room
[1:46:26] <ghostspartan80> you can jump to it
[1:46:30] <laguerrilha> i think if you go foward you can drop back to it
[1:46:40] <Brutalyte616> @woolieversus Word of advice? Use the full-auto mod on the shotgun more often, because the sticky bomb is really slow, imprecise, and it can kill you with splash. Full-auto is perfect for the chaos of the Slayer Gates, and just generally ripping and tearing ass.
[1:46:44] <megamonmon123> you can jump back
[1:46:47] <laguerrilha> oh god it respawned you there
[1:46:48] <theyseemerowling> progress
[1:46:51] <%Shishi1205> Well now you can do it
[1:46:55] <Halospaz117> JUMP
[1:46:55] <%tearfuldevil> just jump
[1:46:56] <%Javaa01> JUMP TO THE LAVA FALL
[1:47:00] <@Solidus_113> the lava waterfall is tricking you
[1:47:01] <%Irridium> jump to it from the wall you're hanging on
[1:47:03] <GarbageNirvana> It was the right idea I think
[1:47:06] <ergothgaming> JUMP AT THE LAVA FALL
[1:47:06] <DDDorsett> Jump it from that Platform
[1:47:07] <gunsrlove> It's juist a platform with some lava on the side
[1:47:08] <$legacy0117> Yes, but some people value family more than anything else, it only becomes evident when they are in danger when it becomes obvious. Also Demons projecting their agony into your mind sucks too.
[1:47:10] <%Solidnick18> they get way trickier later on
[1:47:14] <grimshuck> fucking jump
[1:47:14] <laguerrilha> you can jumo from there
[1:47:19] <ghostspartan80> just jump
[1:47:21] <megamonmon123> yes
[1:47:23] <%Solidnick18> woo
[1:47:24] <laguerrilha> nice
[1:47:25] <grimshuck> Jesus

[1:47:47] <+mighty_max_t> There should be some Cacodemon stress balls. that would be fun
[1:47:50] <%lewdskeletor13> Doomguy collects Funko pops
[1:47:56] <megamonmon123> Funko status: acquired
[1:48:03] <%tearfuldevil> thye're way cooler than funkos
[1:48:06] <%Javaa01> Woolie's got plenty
[1:48:07] <%Irridium> nah these are nendroids
[1:48:07] <%dekkitout> Too late!
[1:48:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> Well now you ddi it
[1:48:10] <@Solidus_113> that hope has turned to zero
[1:48:14] <%tearfuldevil> they're custom models
[1:48:14] <%jinking79> only time Woolie will almost die for a funko
[1:48:15] <GarbageNirvana> You just doomed yourself

[1:48:40] <Klefth> funko pops are a mistake
[1:48:43] <+Capn_Trips> You've sealed your own fate Reggie
[1:48:45] <%FuqBoiSlim> Check your mailbox in 3 weeks, Reggie
[1:48:45] <+DesertPenguin> I hate Funkos. Why would I want an oversized headed version of the thing I like? That's not cute, it's just in the way taking up more space than it needs to :P
[1:48:47] <%GoldeNOVA> or good rather

[1:49:56] <%insomniacCoder> @DesertPenguin I think they are cute. the reason for the large head usually is to show expressions
[1:49:57] <$legacy0117> Although, this is why Space Marines in Warhammer 40k are picked up as young kids first, like the Jedi do in Star Wars.
[1:49:57] <%lewdskeletor13> TUK
[1:50:04] <+DesertPenguin> If Hell Priests are called Hell Priests, can we start calling regular priests Heaven Priests?

[1:53:13] <+DesertPenguin> This is still Mission 2 right?
[1:53:17] <+mechslayer71> @mrathegreat There’s different color schemes for Ui
[1:53:18] <%lewdskeletor13> Ye
[1:53:24] <%lewdskeletor13> Missions are long
[1:53:27] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> use fire when you kill
[1:53:29] <%RioGascar> we are probably 2 levels away from the game punishing woolie for not swapping weapons
[1:53:29] <%Javaa01> @DesertPenguin Yeah this is still Exultia
[1:53:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> BIG BOYS TAKE 3 CHAINSAW FUEL
[1:53:33] <+DesertPenguin> Oh boy, I'm hoping he gets to the you-know-who boss today
[1:53:34] <%RioGascar> maybe 1
[1:53:37] <megamonmon123> i think woolie keeps forgetting one pip on chainsaw wont kill biggies
[1:53:45] <laguerrilha> The hard part isnt learning the mechanics, but remember to use ALL during the fight
[1:53:47] <%MrAtheGreat> @mechslayer71 ahhh I see, cool. I was sorta freaking out about it.
[1:53:50] <venomfury86> man, the speedrun is already 22 minutes
[1:53:52] <%FuqBoiSlim> Man micro missiles do less damage than you think but they're so cool looking

[1:54:16] <Robot_Nixon_> monkaS
[1:54:16] <%RioGascar> I basically forgot to mod swap after a certain point playint the game
[1:54:17] <Tha_Mik> dOING IT
[1:54:18] <%Shishi1205> Woolie has laegies to swtiching weapons
[1:54:23] <%Shishi1205> Alergies*
[1:54:23] <%lewdskeletor13> woolieGASM
[1:54:23] <Snakes_dk> NotLikeThis
[1:54:23] <+DesertPenguin> Micro Missiles are just an ammo dump in this game. You don't have enough ammo to begin with so it runs out fast, and the way it's balanced is that they never stagger enemies
[1:54:24] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> flamebelch
[1:54:41] <GarbageNirvana> I was gonna ask if Woolie forgot about his midair slowdown
[1:54:44] <@Solidus_113> it only gets more difficult from here
[1:54:47] <%lewdskeletor13> God this game gets my blood pumping, it’s kind of addicting to play
[1:54:48] <+DesertPenguin> Flame belch
[1:54:50] <jamaicanboy0209> I'm late. what did I miss?
[1:54:52] <indigo_automaton> Good job
[1:54:52] <%RioGascar> Oh yeah the game is gonna force wooliento learn the lesson of weapon swapping
[1:54:53] <+DesertPenguin> You need armor
[1:54:55] <+BoondockJoker> this game is sweaty hand central
[1:54:59] <invader_rin> Last area, last chance to collect anything you miss
[1:55:01] <+BoondockJoker> gets so intense. esp in later levels
[1:55:05] <megamonmon123> G G WOOLIE
[1:55:05] <%Ghostbody> @lewdskeletor13 it's a good loop
[1:55:07] <%Javaa01> Map says we're clear
[1:55:08] <%Shishi1205> We pinpin
[1:55:08] <laguerrilha> @Solidus_113 it always gets more difficult until credits
[1:55:11] <%Javaa01> Time to peace out
[1:55:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> Is "Switch your weapons" going to become the new "Drop your shield"?
[1:55:12] <grimshuck> Did Woolie forget how to switch weapon?
[1:55:13] <ergothgaming> Level get
[1:55:16] <+DesertPenguin> Try to remember to hold R1 since it slows down time and gives you a moment to think
[1:55:16] <+Capn_Trips> Does Sunhi do private lessons, lol
[1:55:18] <megamonmon123> you good
[1:55:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> This game is like drinking a 6 pack of Monster and some coffee
[1:55:31] <%DappercatEsquire> portal ass portal
[1:55:34] <%Shishi1205> Pat went silent when facing encounters
[1:55:38] <+Truebluemc> @desertpenguin best way to use micro missiles is too kill a fodder demon first to get the damage boost, then unload for stupid damage
[1:55:38] <GokarioRoks> GG!
[1:55:40] <+DesertPenguin> Hold R1 to slow down time while switching weapons. Gives you time to think
[1:55:41] <Tha_Mik> Hundo
[1:55:42] <+nekodelic> how far are we from the point where woolie will be forced to swap weapons?
[1:55:42] <laguerrilha> got everything, nice!
[1:55:47] <kuningaz45> When is this game gonna teach woolie how to MOVE
[1:55:48] <+DesertPenguin> I just never used micro missles ever
[1:55:50] <@Solidus_113> save those points for a bit
[1:55:58] <+DesertPenguin> Scope is better for long-range weakness destruction
[1:55:58] <%dekkitout> RIGHT
[1:55:59] <Halospaz117> IT FEELS SO GOOD
[1:56:02] <%lewdskeletor13> Perfect run

[2:01:18] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus If you follow the waypoints, the game will tutorialize you on all the areas of the hub
[2:01:18] <%Shishi1205> Correct
[2:01:20] <$legacy0117> Look thoroughly on the map.
[2:01:24] <+DesertPenguin> Don't waste them for now. Later you get enough that it doesn't matter

[2:35:18] <%rosemon5001> the armor outside the tower is the best
[2:35:19] <%jinking79> like how chat is screaming their ass off

[2:35:47] <MayorRev> People obsess over girls midriffs yet sleep on Doomguy's sixpack
[2:35:48] <$legacy0117> I like 2016 armor, but that's just a preference really.
[2:35:50] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus get the ice bomb first

[2:37:46] <%thesyndrome> ye
[2:37:47] <%Javaa01> Yes
[2:37:48] <@Solidus_113> ice and flame belch are a good combo
[2:37:48] <DeathByPoke7> yes
[2:37:48] <%Ghostbody> YES
[2:37:48] <%tearfuldevil> yes
[2:37:48] <+DesertPenguin> YES
[2:37:49] <%MrAtheGreat> @burlybeef The eternal battle.
[2:37:50] <laguerrilha> yes
[2:37:50] <%lewdskeletor13> Very useful
[2:37:51] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> yes
[2:37:51] <invader_rin> Yes
[2:37:51] <%Solidnick18> yes
[2:37:52] <BurlyBeef> yeah sure
[2:37:53] <Idante_x> yup
[2:37:56] <$legacy0117> It was designed to hold about 50 Night Sentiels or more, so it is hugeeee
[2:37:59] <+DesertPenguin> Freeze a large group of enemies, flame them all, get lots of armor
[2:38:00] <%thesyndrome> ice bomb + flamebelch is an AMAZING combo
[2:38:01] <$realm_forge> Ice bomb it the fucking tits
[2:38:04] <%dekkitout> Give em the ol freezer burn
[2:38:04] <jayukiyo> yes
[2:38:05] <randominternetsurfer> yes
[2:38:07] <%MrAtheGreat> FIRE BOTH NOW WOOLIE
[2:38:07] <%Shishi1205> Now go down
[2:38:12] <$legacy0117> DOOM FORTRESS ftw
[2:38:18] <+TheBigTaco> THE GAMEPLAY LOOP GROWS
[2:38:19] <BurlyBeef> frost flame tactics is extremely viable
[2:38:20] <+DesertPenguin> one more cool doom skin to look at
[2:38:21] <shin_marx> I focused all the upgrades on grenades and it paid off
[2:38:24] <%RioGascar> And this one I completely forget
[2:38:26] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus Ice Bomb and Frag Grenade DO NOT share a cooldown and can combo together
[2:38:30] <%tearfuldevil> AAAH
[2:38:33] <invader_rin> LOOL
[2:38:34] <+Truebluemc> independant cooldowns too which is nice
[2:38:41] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus Game wont tell you but Ice Bomb and grenade dont share CD. Its an entirely seperate sub weapon
[2:38:43] <$realm_forge> Igniting a frozen enemy is a thing and it sucks for the enemy
[2:38:44] <DatAsuna> "that's psychotic"
[2:38:49] <%MrAtheGreat> Ripatorium here we goooooooo
[2:38:50] <%RioGascar> I completely forgot with this game to swap grenades and mods during batle
[2:38:56] <BurlyBeef> ice bombs actually break the game, but in the best way possible
[2:39:03] <venomfury86> YEYEYEYE
[2:39:05] <MayorRev> its da boi
[2:39:07] <+DesertPenguin> And another one
[2:39:07] <%Javaa01> Suit coin
[2:39:09] <@Solidus_113> coin keep
[2:39:15] <MayorRev> COIN KEEP?
[2:39:18] <Boogius> its a big ol quarter
[2:39:21] <grimshuck> @woolieversus ice bombs and grenades DO NOT share cooldown timer
[2:39:24] <$legacy0117> Guess what that is?
[2:39:24] <+DesertPenguin> I just want him to find that last skin but don't wanna spoil what it is in chat
[2:39:28] <%lewdskeletor13> You’ll get a lot
[2:39:28] <MayorRev> biiiiiig boy
[2:39:31] <Idante_x> PogChamp
[2:39:33] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> you might want to change the switch grenade button since the game expects you to use both types a lot
[2:39:35] <+DesertPenguin> Gypsy Danger

[2:44:35] <jazzygrooves> Hey, i heard you like upgrades, so i gave you some upgrades so you can put some upgrades on your upgrades so you can upgrade while you upgrade
[2:44:36] <DaKnightWarrior> lytAGH MORE
[2:44:37] <+Aeoneth> And you're STILL not done
[2:44:39] <+DesertPenguin> @WoolieVersus Focus on damage over mobility
[2:44:40] <ralphfromdk> It's the suit tokes from the first game, the one you got from dead dudes
[2:44:42] <Idante_x> more power nutzDelet
[2:44:42] <%Neoepochx> Runes don't have upgrades this time.
[2:44:43] <$realm_forge> Oh you thought you were done?
[2:44:43] <%Solidnick18> it's not as overwhelming as you think
[2:44:46] <mark_collins45> WHEEL! OF! DOOM!
[2:44:46] <PsychedelicSnake> So what does swordmaster do "Woolie it's a gun"
[2:44:53] <%Neoepochx> They just exist.
[2:44:55] <%MrAtheGreat> @solidus_113 I suppose you could say these upgrades are... Eternal?
[2:44:56] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> There's more than enough items in the game to get them all
[2:44:57] <laguerrilha> And you have runes too
[2:44:59] <%WanderingSwordsman> Same as 2016
[2:45:00] <@Solidus_113> Also Runes
[2:45:00] <%DaBigVitus> is this the DMCV of fps games?
[2:45:01] <Darren716> And you forgot about runes LUL
[2:45:08] <%Solidnick18> and runes
[2:45:15] <+Truebluemc> these are like the chips you pulled out of the security guards in the last game
[2:45:15] <%Neoepochx> I like fundamentals
[2:45:19] <gunsrlove> DASH
[2:45:20] <+DesertPenguin> Grenades are most important
[2:45:22] <LAYLOWSNIPER> deluxe edition is in my cart ...show me why i should buy
[2:45:24] <DeeVee_TV> No more Rune Mastery moon2PH
[2:45:26] <+DesertPenguin> not really noticable
[2:45:27] <%dekkitout> Fund the fundamentals
[2:45:31] <Brutalyte616> So when does the Slayer unlock his prestige class?
[2:45:35] <+Deadpal> explosive barrels woolie. look at alllll the explosive barrels stuff
[2:45:40] <PsychedelicSnake> CHARACTER ACTION FPS
[2:45:41] <ralphfromdk> You can save up if you want something, you are not forced to go in order
[2:45:42] <+Deadpal> Brutaly e it's even better.
[2:45:42] <%Solidnick18> look at all of them
[2:45:43] <+DesertPenguin> Things are already quick enough, I beat the whole game without any Fundamental upgrades
[2:45:44] <+Deadpal> you don't become one
[2:45:45] <@Solidus_113> END GAME GOALS
[2:45:49] <+Deadpal> you can unlock ALL OF THEM.
[2:45:51] <+Deadpal> at the SAME TIME.
[2:45:53] <+Aeoneth> You literally will get more tokens than you will know what to do with. I had this thing full and STILL had 6 tokens left to spend
[2:45:59] <+Deadpal> ^
[2:46:02] <+DesertPenguin> ^^^
[2:46:04] <%Shishi1205> They were separated in 2016 too
[2:46:06] <venomfury86> a RAD suit
[2:46:09] <+Deadpal> the barrels are THE BEST.
[2:46:16] <+DesertPenguin> Get a second grenade
[2:46:19] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus and this time you don't need to get the low level one first, just whatever the cost is
[2:46:20] <%Shishi1205> Just now the health ammo armor give a bonus
[2:46:22] <%RioGascar> Also some of these are more important than others
[2:46:24] <%SuperKirby24> @deadpal isnt that a cheat floppy disk Kappa
[2:46:26] <%Solidnick18> Yep
[2:46:29] <+DesertPenguin> Ammo Barrels is great
[2:46:32] <mark_collins45> Slpoding barrels are free money
[2:46:32] <+Deadpal> immune to barrels, refresh on explosion AND AMMOS
[2:46:35] <+DesertPenguin> Only once
[2:46:37] <+Deadpal> it's the fucking BEST.
[2:46:37] <+DesertPenguin> Regen only once
[2:46:38] <+YabbaTroll> !uptime
[2:46:39] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 46 minutes
[2:46:44] <akman14> punch barrels for ammo
[2:46:46] <laguerrilha> As long as you get every secrets on the levels you will have more resources that you need
[2:46:49] <%Solidnick18> this is what you want
[2:46:51] <+Deadpal> @SuperKirby24 not even needed by the end of the game for these upgraddes
[2:46:57] <+Deadpal> the floppy disk unlocks the weapon stuff
[2:46:59] <+DesertPenguin> Useless
[2:47:04] <+DesertPenguin> Focus on gameplay
[2:47:07] <%SuperKirby24> ah, nvm then
[2:47:17] <+Deadpal> this isn't a
[2:47:19] <+DesertPenguin> Damage is more important
[2:47:20] <+Deadpal> "one per tree"
[2:47:24] <+Mkingston> EPIC released a video today of a build of Gears of War 3 they made for PS3.
[2:47:25] <+Deadpal> this is "unlock EVERYTHING"
[2:47:32] <gunsrlove> Dash first, increases survival chances
[2:47:35] <laguerrilha> individually they are meh, but getting all those are great
[2:47:39] <grimshuck> it matters the least, secrets are easy to find in this game
[2:47:41] <+DesertPenguin> BEST UPGRADE
[2:47:48] <+DesertPenguin> Two grenades with NO COOLDOWN
[2:47:56] <%Javaa01> STACKS WITH FIRE
[2:48:04] <shin_marx> grenades are infinite ammo
[2:48:11] <%dekkitout> Stack with fire and kill with chainsaw
[2:48:11] <+DesertPenguin> I'm telling you, the grenade upgrades help the loop so much more than anything else here
[2:48:11] <+Sleepy_Puma> Flame belch stacks
[2:48:12] <venomfury86> perfect for Whiplashes
[2:48:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> ALL FOR THE LOOP
[2:48:20] <megaman_sentinel> yes
[2:48:22] <MayorRev> I need to KILL FAST and bullets too slow
[2:48:28] <%Javaa01> Raw damage multiplier on frozen enemies
[2:48:38] <+Deadpal> Finding shit is the best
[2:48:42] <laguerrilha> 1
[2:48:43] <+DesertPenguin> The Loop demands you increase your damage output
[2:48:43] <+Deadpal> cause it made shit easier to get
[2:48:44] <%Javaa01> 1 point
[2:48:44] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus This time you don't need to get the low level one first, just whatever the cost is
[2:48:45] <%MrAtheGreat> All these abilities are good.
[2:48:52] <+YabbaTroll> what level is Woolie on?
[2:48:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> Finding shit on the map is good for lp
[2:48:54] <%Neoepochx> There are a ton of coins by the end of the game.
[2:48:56] <+Sleepy_Puma> exploration will help you get everything else
[2:48:56] <+YabbaTroll> !motivated
[2:48:56] <@Moobot> 1172 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[2:48:59] <gunsrlove> Finding shit is the least usefull, since secrets are easier this time
[2:48:59] <%Solidnick18> finding stuff is good to unlock more stuff
[2:49:01] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> you must do it for the lööp, brother
[2:49:01] <%Javaa01> Get ledge grab
[2:49:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> @yabbatroll About to start 3.
[2:49:13] <+Deadpal> exploration items
[2:49:13] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1262613184097255426
[2:49:14] <+Truebluemc> you can save your point for now if you like
[2:49:16] <megaman_sentinel> yea
[2:49:16] <+Deadpal> yeah.
[2:49:20] <+Deadpal> Go with exploration for sure.
[2:49:22] <+YabbaTroll> @CommanderSqueaks oh sweet, i didnt miss much in the couple hours
[2:49:24] <shin_marx> secrets for sure
[2:49:25] <laguerrilha> yeah it would help you
[2:49:26] <+DesertPenguin> Not that one
[2:49:28] <%alpacasintophats> that's probably the best one that isn't leg grab
[2:49:31] <+DesertPenguin> Not that one either
[2:49:32] <+DesertPenguin> Fuck
[2:49:37] <+Deadpal> it'll help him unlock more later desert
[2:49:46] <+Deadpal> he'll eventually get everything
[2:49:47] <%alpacasintophats> ok not that one the other one
[2:49:49] <+Deadpal> before the end of the lp
[2:49:50] <%alpacasintophats> but w/e
[2:49:51] <laguerrilha> he will be able to get everything
[2:49:55] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> The dossier one is kinda useless cuz it just spoils you on items
[2:49:58] <Darren716> Yeah he's gonna max this out no problem
[2:50:03] <%alpacasintophats> you'll probably have everything by the lp's end
[2:50:11] <+DesertPenguin> You want the one that shows secrets on the map itself. The mapfinder thing is always in an obvious place. And unlocking what they are only removes the question marks from the log screen. Not that useful
[2:50:12] <%Javaa01> Big ol Oreo
[2:50:12] <%Solidnick18> Take the knee
[2:50:20] <%RioGascar> god what in the fuck is the next doom gonna be
[2:50:22] <+Aeoneth> Coin Ghosts
[2:50:26] <+Deadpal> for the gates get everything else first imo
[2:50:28] <+TheOneCalledRock> aren't there MORE than the max amount?
[2:50:28] <%Neoepochx> There are plenty in the overworld
[2:50:29] <%Solidnick18> ghost bros
[2:50:31] <%Javaa01> You get them in the levels
[2:50:32] <%RioGascar> it feels like it might be cutting things to stop the bloat
[2:50:33] <%Neoepochx> and the levels
[2:50:34] <%lewdskeletor13> I punched these guys so many times trying to grab the coin
[2:50:35] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[2:50:35] <+DesertPenguin> There are more than enough
[2:50:43] <megaman_sentinel> don't worry
[2:50:45] <+Aeoneth> YOu 100% can Woolie
[2:50:46] <%GeneralSCPatton> @riogascar DooMorrowind
[2:50:46] <+Truebluemc> you get a ton of tokens
[2:50:49] <Darren716> Honestly its best to get the mods and crystals best
[2:50:51] <$legacy0117> DOOM ETERNAL ALL DAY EVERYDAY
[2:50:54] <+Aeoneth> You also get them for completing challenges

[2:51:57] <ComfyFox> 6ft between u and doomguy
[2:51:58] <+YabbaTroll> dont get in his way
[2:51:58] <$realm_forge> He’s like Bigfoot but also a walking nuke
[2:51:59] <%Reverend_Roscoe> HE MIGHT FUCKING KILL YOU
[2:51:59] <mR_NibZz> yourma1EZ i will rip and tear you
[2:52:00] <%tearfuldevil> those aren't the uac
[2:52:01] <Darren716> I dont blame them, civilians should stay away
[2:52:02] <$legacy0117> COLLATERAL DAMAGE.
[2:52:03] <shin_marx> doom guy plays blanka
[2:52:04] <venomfury86> it's amazing they actually call him Doomguy

[2:52:09] <MayorRev> reggie pls
[2:52:09] <Darren716> Thats ARC not UAC woolie
[2:52:10] <DatAsuna> "New reports coming say that doom guy uses wifi"
[2:52:10] <$legacy0117> Not that.
[2:52:11] <%Reverend_Roscoe> THAT'S NOT A UAC MESSAGE
[2:52:13] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Do not antagonize the Doomslayer
[2:52:13] <%lewdskeletor13> Doomguy is cool
[2:52:13] <%Javaa01> Yeah, only one message per visit here
[2:52:14] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> WOOLIE misinterpreted the broadcast not surprising...
[2:52:17] <haisho> you'll find out eventually
[2:52:18] <@Solidus_113> Cultist Base BOYS PogChamp
[2:52:19] <%GeneralSCPatton> ARC IS NOT UAC
[2:52:20] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> It's less "doom slayer is bad" and more "doom slayer is an unstoppable force and if you stand in his way, even accidentally, there is a good chance he will ABSOLUTELY fuck your shit"
[2:52:20] <%Reverend_Roscoe> THAT'S NOT THE BAD GUYS
[2:52:21] <%Shishi1205> That's ARC
[2:52:23] <turbofolk> oh woolie you are gonna get dissapointed
[2:52:25] <%Shishi1205> not UAC
[2:52:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> I think it's more like "He's killing demons, but we don't know if he's just killing EVERYTHING, so stand back". THat's NOT UAC WOOLIE, that's resistance.
[2:52:29] <%dekkitout> "Please be in mind of social distancing when Doomguy is near"
[2:52:29] <+DesertPenguin> Olivia is dead
[2:52:30] <+Aeoneth> More like, he's helping us, but we don't know if that because he wants to or if it's blind rage
[2:52:31] <RunningNGunning> ARC is not the UAC
[2:52:31] <SomethingWickedStream> 6ft apart from doom guy
[2:52:33] <laguerrilha> She was weak
[2:52:33] <+DesertPenguin> You killed her
[2:52:34] <%tearfuldevil> @RioGascar oh, i don't think so either, but random earth governemnt/military survivors have no idea
[2:52:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie can't read.
[2:52:38] <%lewdskeletor13> ARC are good guys, UAC bad
[2:52:38] <+ninja_galt> wut wut
[2:52:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> ARC IS RESISTANCE, NOT UAC
[2:52:39] <mark_collins45> Olivia is a puddle of goo now
[2:52:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> ARC IS NOT UAC WOOLIE
[2:52:45] <+Theworld732> Arc good UAC bad
[2:52:48] <venomfury86> UAC bad, ARC good
[2:52:49] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Woolie needs to better pay attention
[2:52:50] <+CptnCampy61> That’s ARC not UAC
[2:52:50] <$realm_forge> Woolie will figure it out
[2:52:52] <DXLelouch24> youll know, but their gonna tease your balls for a bit
[2:52:54] <+ninja_galt> Ark, good game
[2:52:58] <%Reverend_Roscoe> WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S GONNA DO
[2:52:59] <+YabbaTroll> because hes fucking scary dude
[2:53:01] <%jiggy_snipe> he appears to be on our side but we don't know because he is um dangerous
[2:53:01] <%Reverend_Roscoe> YES
[2:53:02] <Halospaz117> BECAUSE YOU DO BIG MURDER
[2:53:02] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> arc
[2:53:02] <%dekkitout> Right- cause it's not like 2/3 of their names overlap
[2:53:03] <%Shishi1205> yes
[2:53:03] <haisho> yep
[2:53:04] <%tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus ARC, the human resistance, yes
[2:53:04] <Darren716> I played this level too much because a glitch stopped me from having all 10 combat encounters
[2:53:05] <RunningNGunning> yes
[2:53:05] <laguerrilha> yes
[2:53:06] <%Javaa01> Yes, ARC meaning the Resistance
[2:53:06] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> yes
[2:53:08] <%FuqBoiSlim> "I only poo poo farted for the good of humanity"
[2:53:09] <mark_collins45> ARC Good UAC Bad
[2:53:09] <%jiggy_snipe> yep
[2:53:09] <Darren716> Yes
[2:53:10] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Yes, because you're a scary guy.
[2:53:12] <unit24> Doom guy is scary as shit to normal people
[2:53:13] <$legacy0117> ARC = EARTH DEFENSE FORCE
[2:53:13] <iwa5h4ck3d> UAC Are the virtual ladies in the play world
[2:53:13] <%lewdskeletor13> I pee pee poo pooed for the good of humanity
[2:53:14] <%Reverend_Roscoe> NO
[2:53:16] <%Shishi1205> That's about it
[2:53:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> ARC, they're just saying they don't know if he's killing EVERYTHING, so just give him space.
[2:53:17] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> NO
[2:53:18] <%Reverend_Roscoe> THAT'S CORRECT
[2:53:18] <Ner234> Because Doom Guy is just kinda scary
[2:53:19] <%tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus yes, ebcause you're scary
[2:53:20] <laguerrilha> This level is long
[2:53:21] <%Javaa01> You're a rampaging ball of murder
[2:53:22] <haisho> ARC is the human resistance on earth, UAC is UAC
[2:53:22] <%Solidnick18> they are very scared
[2:53:27] <Darren716> ARC is good, they just dont want civilians to get in the way
[2:53:28] <$realm_forge> No doomguy is a scary mutherfucker
[2:53:30] <mark_collins45> Doomguy is a unstoppable killing machine, he would be a little scary
[2:53:30] <%dekkitout> Not quite- just don't get in the way
[2:53:30] <%lewdskeletor13> They’re just like Doomguy is scary don’t go near him
[2:53:33] <%jiggy_snipe> he's a ball of fury/rage
[2:53:35] <%tearfuldevil> that preacher's some random crazy guy
[2:53:40] <ralphfromdk> No humans have ever really gotten close to meat him and find out if he's cool :P
[2:53:40] <%FuqBoiSlim> DoomMan is very scawy
[2:53:43] <$realm_forge> Doomguy scares literally everybody
[2:53:47] <+YabbaTroll> they dont know if he's rip and tear everything or just rip and tear demons
[2:53:47] <%RioGascar> i again dont think doomguy would hurt you if you arent a demon or are a regular civilian
[2:53:50] <+TheBigTaco> !uptime
[2:53:50] <%mitchteck> Yes
[2:53:50] <Nilbanas> He's dangerous they don't if he's there to kill EVERYTHING!
[2:53:51] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 54 minutes
[2:53:51] <Kirbachev> It's more like erring on the side of caution.
[2:53:51] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @WoolieVersus if a guy was killing your enemies with no signs for remorse left and right and didn't say anything or give any sign of emotion, would you try to get near him or interact with him in anyway or just let him do his thing?
[2:53:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> That crazy preacher knows.
[2:53:54] <%jiggy_snipe> yea, they don't know
[2:53:56] <%lewdskeletor13> They see him as an avenging angel
[2:53:58] <venomfury86> Pray that he is watching!
[2:54:01] <+adamthreetimes> ARC Good, UAC bad
[2:54:03] <+Truebluemc> UAC prob talked mad shit about Doom Slayer after the first game so people are unsure
[2:54:04] <%Solidnick18> fuckin hell priests
[2:54:05] <%tearfuldevil> @RioGascar i agree, but the ARC have no real way of knowing at the moment
[2:54:15] <+Aeoneth> Correct, they dont know if Doomguy is a saviour or just a berserker
[2:54:17] <%RioGascar> now he might be super scary, but doomguy will probably protect humans
[2:54:19] <%Shishi1205> They do know he kills
[2:54:24] <%lewdskeletor13> This is a good level
[2:54:26] <%Javaa01> Lore on your left
[2:54:27] <asurite_warrior> ahh this levels a bitch
[2:54:29] <Hal10k> Woolie would YOU go near Doomguy?
[2:54:31] <%jiggy_snipe> they know he kills real good
[2:54:32] <$realm_forge> I love the look of this level its pinnacle magitech
[2:54:36] <%Solidnick18> ahh this one
[2:54:36] <Augus7717> ARC: "Dont approach Doomguy, he's a dork."
[2:54:41] <laguerrilha> You can PIN the chalenges
[2:54:43] <@Solidus_113> 3 for one battery
[2:54:44] <%Solidnick18> Yep now you got these
[2:54:46] <%jiggy_snipe> like real good woolieGLORY
[2:54:49] <%lewdskeletor13> Doomguy def wouldn’t hurt civvies though
[2:54:50] <mark_collins45> ez pz
[2:54:51] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> The slayer is a tornado that you just shouldn't stand next to
[2:54:53] <venomfury86> the UAC deny the Doom Slayer's existence
[2:54:53] <asurite_warrior> hopefully its more fun on normal
[2:54:55] <invader_rin> Do challenges to get batteries too
[2:54:58] <%Solidnick18> and doing them gets you a battery
[2:55:00] <%RioGascar> Woolie would absolutely go near doomguy, he said he would be front row for the mech fights
[2:55:07] <Darren716> These are usually easy, except the ones that require specific glory kills
[2:55:14] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> Doom Guy is like that scene from Jurassic Park 3 where the Spinosaurus is chasing the protagonists and the T. Rex attacks it and the protagonists are like "oh shit that's good for us but we should probably just book it instead of thinking the T. Rex is an ally"
[2:55:35] <%Binary_Fireball> cultist base was that "time to get gud" level for me
[2:55:46] <%RioGascar> Yeah time to get gud
[2:55:48] <%RioGascar> Or die
[2:55:49] <%tearfuldevil> @RioGascar woolie would go to a KOF or SF fight, and die when some dude gets possese by Orochi or Psycho Power or whatever
[2:56:05] <%RioGascar> Learn the combat system and weapon swapping
[2:56:16] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @Darren716 there's one challenge later on where you have to do a specific glory kill on an enemy that only shows up once in the level and that's just bs
[2:56:16] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:56:26] <@Solidus_113> Every stage has skill checks
[2:56:29] <Darren716> It took me like 3 times to do that one
[2:56:33] <@Solidus_113> because you get so much more shit
[2:56:34] <%Binary_Fireball> I was decent enough to not have to focus on the loop until I got there
[2:56:36] <%Binary_Fireball> but then the loop
[2:56:43] <%tearfuldevil> personally i'm fine with watching the KOF or King of Iron Fists or World Warrior torunaments on TV, thank you very much
[2:56:43] <Darren716> Also they arent clear about which side you have to do the glory kill on
[2:56:59] <Darren716> Because they dont specify if it's your left or the demon's left
[2:57:02] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> Olivia pierce got it pretty hard tho once she fused
[2:57:03] <%tearfuldevil> woolie you melted that brain
[2:57:09] <Darren716> She did
[2:57:14] <laguerrilha> you blew her head open with a BFG, she died LUL
[2:57:17] <+tuchpi> she ate so much shit LUL
[2:57:18] <+Qsmash_> but you killed her
[2:57:20] <superchronicc> he's only on the 3rd level jeez YEP
[2:57:21] <%lewdskeletor13> Isn’t the spider Olivia?
[2:57:23] <%dekkitout> Arctic Assault Doomguy
[2:57:24] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @turbofolk
[2:57:27] <%tearfuldevil> @lewdskeletor13 yes
[2:57:31] <+TheBigTaco> you melted her spider brain woolie, there are few things more satisfying
[2:57:32] <%tearfuldevil> @lewdskeletor13 sort of
[2:57:34] <%Solidnick18> you wanna do em all
[2:57:41] <Nilbanas> Art design is good in this game :)
[2:57:42] <mark_collins45> Arachnotrons are made up of the remains of Olivia
[2:57:48] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[2:57:50] <megaman_sentinel> rip an tear
[2:57:51] <Snakes_dk> LUL
[2:57:52] <%lewdskeletor13> They’re usually pretty easy
[2:57:52] <%GoldeNOVA> Son of a bitch must pay? woolieSMUG
[2:57:55] <%tearfuldevil> woolie wants to murder woman, not spider monsters Kappa
[2:57:56] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> either the spider is Olivia or she's some sort of sacrifice to summon the spider like Yu-Gi-Oh or something
[2:58:02] <+TheBigTaco> woolie desperately wants to murder a frail old woman
[2:58:03] <%dekkitout> There's no head to mount on a pike
[2:58:05] <Halospaz117> I get it, you wanted it to be more personal
[2:58:08] <%Shishi1205> Glory killing her ass would be enat
[2:58:08] <%jiggy_snipe> yea
[2:58:12] <+captain_elsewhere> necron in ffix elaW
[2:58:14] <%Javaa01> The highlighted bit of the wall
[2:58:16] <+YabbaTroll> the wall dont look like wall
[2:58:16] <@Solidus_113> use the light
[2:58:17] <%Shishi1205> Walls down
[2:58:18] <venomfury86> i think Olivia was just sacrificed to summon the Spider Mastermind
[2:58:23] <%MrAtheGreat> Look down at 45-50 degrees
[2:58:42] <laguerrilha> she was to much of a coward to get a cool death
[2:58:52] <UvBenServed> They chantin
[2:58:56] <%mighty_max_t> I love how goofy Doomguy climbing the walls is. It's the perfect speed and sound effect
[2:59:09] <@Solidus_113> ice > flame > grenade

[2:59:17] <%lewdskeletor13> @mighty_max_t It’s hilarious, like a giant cat climbing a tree or something
[2:59:22] <laguerrilha> @WoolieVersus you can pin the challenges on the screen to remind your self

[3:32:18] <%Javaa01> Stagger for longer is only really useful for challenges
[3:32:20] <sniffy77> unless you have that already
[3:32:23] <+Sleepy_Puma> Air movement is like vital later on
[3:32:29] <dfs_k> saving throw is the coward's choice
[3:32:31] <Darren716> i think 1 ups are used first
[3:32:32] <$legacy0117> This runes are the best. Chronos works well with a cou ppl le of this.
[3:32:34] <soller123> the rune triggers when you run out of 1ups
[3:32:35] <+DesertPenguin> 1ups are first
[3:32:37] <randominternetsurfer> AIR
[3:32:40] <+VidulaSaix> @WoolieVersus Rememeber these are equips. You can only have so many at once
[3:32:44] <Kidbizzaro> 1UPs are first
[3:32:44] <+kewlmyc> air control, but you do you
[3:32:44] <$legacy0117> couple of these*
[3:32:52] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus You only get one of those before you die, even completing a level DOES NOT recharge the Saving Throw
[3:32:57] <+DesertPenguin> it's a last ditch effort
[3:33:02] <SyLuX45> You can use it once per Mission so to me it’s kinda useless
[3:33:06] <soller123> its a good rune to equip if you run out :P
[3:33:16] <$legacy0117> That bites.
[3:33:16] <%J0RD4NPR1M3> DI
[3:33:18] <$realm_forge> Bloodpunch health will help immediately
[3:33:21] <%Javaa01> You get one per full death
[3:33:22] <DXLelouch24> @WoolieVersus nades dont share a cd fyi, you can use both of em all the time
[3:33:26] <+VidulaSaix> Recharge is good too
[3:33:28] <+Truebluemc> its more of a UN perk
[3:33:28] <sniffy77> i like that one
[3:33:29] <+kewlmyc> that's a good choice too
[3:33:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> Air control and recharge are great
[3:33:34] <Robot_Nixon_> its a good safety net for ultra nightmare
[3:33:35] <+Spatulord> Yeyeah
[3:33:37] <soller123> does it work on mods too?
[3:33:39] <+catburger100> theres a secret in front of you
[3:33:39] <%Javaa01> On Ultra Nightmare, Saving Throw gives you ONE extra life during the ENTIRE game
[3:33:40] <Kidbizzaro> Respectable choice
[3:33:45] <%gatorafan> you get one... until it's done Kappa
[3:33:46] <%trustycoyote> Honestly theyre all really handy
[3:33:51] <+DesertPenguin> Ewuipment is so good tho
[3:33:51] <+catburger100> on the platform
[3:33:55] <+VidulaSaix> AngelThump
[3:33:56] <+DesertPenguin> Which did he grab?
[3:33:56] <$realm_forge> Solid
[3:33:57] <%Solidnick18> angel power woo
[3:33:59] <DXLelouch24> Grenades dont share a cooldown, you cna switch to the other one when ones on cd
[3:34:04] <$legacy0117> Equipment is very, very good for flamebelch.
[3:34:10] <soller123> that would be ultra-nightmare
[3:34:10] <%Shishi1205> Ultra nightmare
[3:34:10] <venomfury86> depends what you prefer
[3:34:14] <%trustycoyote> @soller123 I believe it's just grenades
[3:34:16] <+DesertPenguin> Yea, you switch and use them all and then bam flame belch is back before you know it
[3:34:22] <+catburger100> go to the platform
[3:34:25] <Nomad94> why anyone would do that to themselves is beyond me
[3:34:25] <$legacy0117> Equipment speed*
[3:34:31] <mark_collins45> behind you
[3:34:36] <soller123> @trustycoyote flamebelch too no?
[3:34:37] <mark_collins45> neermind
[3:34:37] <+catburger100> wait
[3:34:45] <Robot_Nixon_> @Nomad94 ultra nightmare?
[3:34:46] <%Javaa01> So anyways here's a new enemy you'll learn to hate
[3:34:47] <%GeneralSCPatton> The permadeath difficulty is a toggle on your main difficulty choice

[3:35:40] <+Truebluemc> i would defo recommend watching some 100% Ultra Nightmare runs. they are suuuuper entertaining. The speedrun only takes 3 hrs now
[3:35:40] <+DesertPenguin> use the freakin' ice
[3:35:45] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Pat warned you.
[3:35:45] <sniffy77> these are near the top of the KILL FIRST list

[3:36:09] <+catburger100> theres a secret
[3:36:12] <+DesertPenguin> @WoolieVersus Think about it. Enemy moves fast. How do you cancel that out? Remove movement entirely with Ice Bomb
[3:36:14] <megaman_sentinel> pat was right
[3:36:16] <grimshuck> Pat warned you
[3:36:17] <leomuratore> Now we breathe

[3:36:43] <%dekkitout> Coward
[3:36:46] <%trustycoyote> Yeah... Sneks dont mess around

[3:36:57] <akman14> Ksss? more like hissssss
[3:36:59] <+jepupu> No feet on sneks
[3:37:01] <+catburger100> lock on definitely
[3:37:01] <DeathByPoke7> snakes dont have feet
[3:37:02] <cheesedburgers> Demons are not for sex they are for killing
[3:37:03] <%FuqBoiSlim> Join the dark sssssside reggie
[3:37:04] <soller123> just lock-on the snake ez
[3:37:08] <Kalinflip> @cheesedburgers same thing
[3:37:12] <grimshuck> lock on destorys snakes
[3:37:17] <nobody12349> Reggie hates Snakes because they don't have feet.
[3:37:18] <+Aeoneth> Lock on is better this game imo
[3:37:21] <asurite_warrior> Reggie dont worry most snakes done have laser swords and human skulls
[3:37:23] <%GeneralSCPatton> EVERYONE LIKES SNEX
[3:37:24] <Robot_Nixon_> hl rocket launcher is honestly the best
[3:37:27] <Darren716> Lock on is amazing, especially for one boss later
[3:37:32] <ralphfromdk> But you can't aim Woolie, laser would suck for you :D
[3:37:32] <%Irridium> Remote Detonate is the GOAT
[3:37:37] <+DesertPenguin> lock on is infinitely better
[3:37:39] <Equirah> lazer guided, colides on environmet
[3:37:42] <+Truebluemc> Lock on op
[3:37:43] <+YabbaTroll> only thing better than hl rocket launcher is hl2 rocket launcher
[3:37:44] <soller123> @Darren716 what boss? first letter please
[3:37:50] <%Irridium> especially the last upgrade. 2 rockets for the price of one if you time it right
[3:37:51] <Darren716> K
[3:38:02] <%FuqBoiSlim> remote detonation is pretty boss for an enemy that comes up later (if you know you know)
[3:38:03] <+DesertPenguin> Lock-On is basically three round burst for rockets. That's insanely OP
[3:38:06] <%Javaa01> Remote Detonate is incredible for lower tier enemies, Lock On Is incredible for DPS against big bois
[3:38:09] <+Ether101_Prime> Rocket upgrades are great for problems in this game that will make you love them.
[3:38:13] <%Shishi1205> check lore of sneks @WoolieVersus
[3:38:13] <+Spatulord> Remote detonation is overrated tbh
[3:38:15] <+catburger100> mod the rocket to the lock on
[3:38:21] <soller123> every weapon works good on K honestly
[3:38:38] <grimshuck> Lock on destorys snakes
[3:38:38] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:38:43] <Robot_Nixon_> remote detonation is great for pinkies and sheilded bros so you can detonate behind them
[3:38:43] <Darren716> Yeah but RL melts with the burst
[3:38:45] <sniffy77> good choice
[3:38:47] <Tha_Mik> Lockon ftw
[3:38:55] <grimshuck> thank god
[3:38:55] <%Irridium> rip rocket ammo
[3:39:02] <%trustycoyote> @Spatulord Really? I found most people stuck with Lock-on. I switch that mod constantly
[3:39:03] <venomfury86> Remote detonation is also good for Pinkies
[3:39:03] <soller123> lock-on one shots snakes, revenants and I think maybe hell knights too right?
[3:39:07] <+VidulaSaix> SNEK
[3:39:12] <CoffeeSlice> LUL
[3:39:16] <+YabbaTroll> for some reason using regular minigun did more damage than mobile turret minigun against K
[3:39:17] <+kewlmyc> SNEK
[3:39:19] <%Javaa01> Ice Bomb and Lock On are your best options
[3:39:22] <%Solidnick18> lock on destroys em
[3:39:22] <awalr> shoot it until it dies

[3:40:15] <venomfury86> my most hated enemy after Mr. M
[3:40:19] <soller123> who the hell wrote these notes anyway, the ARC?
[3:40:20] <+YabbaTroll> @MayorRev nah thats what you stab them with (in certain glory kills)

[3:41:03] <+jepupu> If you didn't get the flamethrower part yet, those shield guys definitely would've given it
[3:41:03] <soller123> oh man this next fight also quite good

[3:41:26] <+Spatulord> @trustycoyote I gave using it an honest try, but it just isnt as good as the lockon in most cases. But regardless, I still see lots of people saying how amazing RD is. Idk, that's just not the experience I've had with it

[3:42:10] <%Solidnick18> Yes
[3:42:13] <%Irridium> @Spatulord can only speak for myself but I pretty much only used RD. Especially with the last upgrade where you detonate it just before it hits, then the rocket itself hits. two rocket hits for only 1 rocket ammo

[3:45:52] <%Amardeux> not quite my tempo LUL
[3:45:53] <soller123> I dunno guys, I found pit much harder - this fight has got quite a lot of room to manouver
[3:45:55] <+TheBigTaco> LUL
[3:45:57] <Robot_Nixon_> time to schmoove
[3:45:58] <$legacy0117> SNEK weakness to ice is that they stay stunned by it for longer.

[3:46:12] <dfs_k> it begins
[3:46:13] <invader_rin> You're forgetting to move
[3:46:14] <%Irridium> bodied
[3:46:17] <%Amardeux> the panic is setting in LUL
[3:46:17] <%Javaa01> Gotta think faster then that
[3:46:18] <shin_marx> when in doubt, sticky bomb shotgun is ace
[3:46:21] <akman14> 0 IQ play
[3:46:21] <+catburger100> dude move PokShadowmew
[3:46:23] <%Shishi1205> never stay in place
[3:46:24] <MKII> wait it's move AND shoot?
[3:46:26] <+Spatulord> RUN BOY RUN
[3:46:32] <Cybermancer> @WoolieVersus The mod swap in the weapon wheel only sticks if you switch to the weapon in the wheel
[3:46:34] <lagandcrash> I CANT MOVE AND SHOOT WHAT
[3:46:34] <%lewdskeletor13> Gotta go fast
[3:46:36] <greynob> Drop your shield
[3:46:36] <Snakes_dk> games ramping up
[3:46:37] <DatAsuna> you can get a decent flow while doing the "right way" but it's not my jam
[3:46:38] <%Javaa01> Nope, left is Bolt
[3:46:38] <%mitchteck> Sticky Bomb can kill turrets too
[3:46:40] <zer0enixx> You’re dash is key to dodging most if not all attacks
[3:46:41] <venomfury86> The true Doom starts here
[3:46:42] <%Lion_kun> lol at the people who wanted Woolie to play on UV
[3:46:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> Do it during mid-air slowdown
[3:46:43] <%Javaa01> Right is Micro
[3:46:44] <Yummy_Nukes> @woolieversus if you channel your rage you will play gooder
[3:46:51] <Cybermancer> So you can't swap the mod in the wheel and then go to another weapon
[3:47:08] <%tearfuldevil> oh no
[3:47:11] <mark_collins45> circle strafe
[3:47:13] <%dekkitout> Run and gun as the kids say

[3:47:42] <%Solidnick18> Doom is now
[3:47:43] <asurite_warrior> This world is a bitch.
[3:47:44] <+TheBigTaco> sticky nades are much better for weakpoints then snipe
[3:47:49] <soller123> this fight is awesome on master version
[3:47:49] <simon__well> Use dash all the time
[3:47:49] <+kewlmyc> Anyone keeping a death count?
[3:47:50] <megaman_sentinel> the curb is real
[3:47:52] <Kidbizzaro> Reggie gives good advice
[3:47:55] <%BearSawed> kite that bitch
[3:47:58] <%alpacasintophats> hey is he on hurt meplenty still?
[3:47:59] <$legacy0117> Get armor brah
[3:48:01] <Darren716> Honestly snipe and slo mo is great for the weak points
[3:48:03] <+frankthetank285> woolie you dont hsave to kill him first
[3:48:03] <venomfury86> Ultra Violence? LUL
[3:48:04] <invader_rin> You just gotta think faster
[3:48:05] <vVAstrAVv> what difficulty is he on. still normal?
[3:48:06] <%alpacasintophats> this feels like ultra violence
[3:48:08] <Tha_Mik> Nice
[3:48:09] <asurite_warrior> I went here with lose health because all i see health in this game is the ability to make more mistakes.
[3:48:14] <+kewlmyc> Still normal, yes
[3:48:16] <soller123> looks like hurt me plenty
[3:48:16] <asurite_warrior> low
[3:48:20] <zer0enixx> U need to get used to dashing alot
[3:48:22] <SyLuX45> You melt so fast when you got 4-5 Heavy demons around
[3:48:29] <+catburger100> don't stand still just Move!!!!
[3:48:35] <+nekodelic> I hate when they don't swallow
[3:48:39] <invader_rin> Keep moving
[3:48:42] <%GeneralSCPatton> Melee does no damage
[3:48:51] <soller123> he's on level 3 and still didnt notice mele does almost nothing?
[3:48:51] <+Spatulord> That Caco is a spitter sbfpPatschwitz
[3:48:52] <Snakes_dk> so much happening
[3:48:59] <+VidulaSaix> This is where Woolie become a real Doomguy VoHiYo
[3:49:00] <+TheBigTaco> PANIC TIME
[3:49:03] <raikagelord1> Is their a blood Totem around?
[3:49:10] <%Shishi1205> Never melee if no blood punch ergo just blood punch when surrounded
[3:49:15] <venomfury86> they nerfed the normal punch in this game compared to 2016
[3:49:17] <%FuqBoiSlim> @raikagelord1 those dont show up yet
[3:49:24] <%Amardeux> rip and tear until it is done
[3:49:26] <%trustycoyote> Luckily any progress made during challenges is carried over even if you die. No worries about losing progress there. @WoolieVersus
[3:49:28] <%Lightwolfe> you tend to back into a lot of bad stuff, get that spatial awareness down my dude
[3:49:31] <soller123> totems get introduced in level 5
[3:49:32] <+Ether101_Prime> We need to remind Woolie that he can change the difficulty on the option screen.
[3:49:33] <%Lion_kun> Woolie stop trying to find enemies
[3:49:34] <%alpacasintophats> you need turrent kills with sticky bombs for the mastery
[3:49:37] <%Solidnick18> remember you have lock on
[3:49:37] <mark_collins45> Rocket Launcher is not a shotgun!
[3:49:37] <%Lion_kun> just kill what you see
[3:49:43] <+catburger100> get the turret on the back fo that spider demon
[3:49:44] <Tha_Mik> You got this

[3:50:04] <akman14> Woolie tryharding rn
[3:50:05] <+nekodelic> learning the hard way how controller is not the best way to play this game
[3:50:10] <+DesertPenguin> Give Reggie the controller and show him how hard this is
[3:50:11] <%Binary_Fireball> the main mechanic is the glory kill
[3:50:18] <invader_rin> Splash damage

[3:50:29] <+DesertPenguin> Reggie is backseat gaming really hard LUL
[3:50:34] <soller123> I wish we had the exact number of all the weapons in game - I'm kinda wondering at what range does SSG do more than balista

[3:54:19] <dan_g_v> yo, did we find buff busty bunny gal Daisy already?
[3:54:25] <$legacy0117> So yeah, that particular fight usually kills most that get there first time.

[3:54:48] <+Ether101_Prime> Remember, you can always change the difficulty under the Settings option on the Pause Menu.
[3:54:58] <%Neoepochx> You can make that jump, you just whiffed.
[3:54:59] <%Shishi1205> forward
[3:55:00] <zer0enixx> @desertpenguin Definitely with upgrades
[3:55:05] <SainEdge> @DesertPenguin you keep your stuff
[3:55:11] <SomethingWickedStream> wall grab woolie
[3:55:14] <+DesertPenguin> Yea but what do you prefer? That or starting a new file
[3:55:14] <%Shishi1205> you jump too soon
[3:55:14] <invader_rin> You can make it
[3:55:14] <Robot_Nixon_> @DesertPenguin like personal choice or do you mean if the game lets you
[3:55:15] <%Lightwolfe> that is right
[3:55:17] <+DesertPenguin> Personal choice
[3:55:18] <%lewdskeletor13> There’s a wall to grab onto after the second bar
[3:55:20] <SleepyMaribo> @WoolieVersus you feelin it? you feelin that loop?
[3:55:22] <zocano> Did chat peer pressure woolie to do Ultra Violence?
[3:55:25] <SomethingWickedStream> Wall grab
[3:55:26] <%Javaa01> @Ether101_Prime There's not much farther down he can go down in difficulties at this point beyond babby mode
[3:55:27] <%purplehermit12> purplehermit12 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[3:55:27] <+catburger100> no theres a climbable wall
[3:55:29] <%Neoepochx> You can make the second monkey bar.
[3:55:30] <%Shishi1205> @zocano no
[3:55:35] <%Lightwolfe> dash>Bar>Wall
[3:55:36] <twoto858> you can reach the second bar
[3:55:37] <Kidbizzaro> you can totally do it
[3:55:39] <vVAstrAVv> Woolie wtf
[3:55:40] <+DesertPenguin> I like being limited by what the game offers you in it's own time, but having to look for upgrades sometimes can be a chore
[3:55:42] <+doc_ock_rokc> No he is on hurt me plenty
[3:55:45] <zocano> Ah ok that’s good
[3:55:46] <%Shishi1205> yes
[3:55:46] <Robot_Nixon_> @DesertPenguin I try ultra nightmare runs. on pc tho. feels like a rouge like
[3:55:47] <$legacy0117> What is the difficulty anyway?
[3:55:47] <%Neoepochx> You kept whiffing the monkey bar.
[3:55:48] <%Solidnick18> yes
[3:55:49] <SomethingWickedStream> yes
[3:55:49] <resloxxx> Keep upgrades, that way I dont have to worry about Farming for upgrades
[3:55:52] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> I think so.
[3:55:52] <%Shishi1205> Second monkey bar into wall
[3:55:55] <%domokun124> it is right woollie you just have to gain enough speed and height to get it
[3:55:55] <dan_g_v> ultra violence is the default state of the doom guy, no need to pressure him
[3:55:56] <$realm_forge> You gotta boost at the height of your jump

[3:56:19] <twoto858> You're missing the second bar
[3:56:22] <resloxxx> Swing Swing wall, it has some timing into it
[3:56:23] <%lewdskeletor13> You use the second bar to get the wall
[3:56:27] <+DesertPenguin> Oh this part took Pat so long
[3:56:28] <+Spatulord> You can make the second bar
[3:56:30] <$legacy0117> Okay Ultra-Violence then I suppose.

[3:56:40] <%Shishi1205> yes
[3:56:42] <%Neoepochx> You are making it way harder than it needs to be.
[3:56:43] <%Lightwolfe> yes
[3:56:43] <%domokun124> yes
[3:56:43] <ralphfromdk> No, it's all about them monkeybars

[3:57:05] <%Neoepochx> You keep waiting to do the dash.
[3:57:07] <zocano> If you are overall comfortable with FPSs, do UV and you can always drop down if you’re not feeling it
[3:57:08] <invader_rin> He'll figure it out, it's not that hard of a puzzle
[3:57:10] <%domokun124> yeah it takes some getting used to

[4:05:50] <Darren716> I've gotta hand it to woolie, that pit kicked my ass a few times

[4:05:57] <%FboyDaKing> @dedlokpm considering this is a stream probably not a bad start to go.

[4:06:13] <DDDorsett> mraeroPog
[4:06:14] <Darren716> Youre getting close to the end of this level
[4:06:15] <Tha_Mik> Intense
[4:06:16] <+VidulaSaix> So Reggie, how about them SNEK
[4:06:16] <%trustycoyote> Hell yeah!
[4:06:16] <%jiggy_snipe> loving it
[4:06:17] <Visorak6> woolie's getting much better
[4:06:19] <mark_collins45> The Reggie Show
[4:06:19] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Hey bro
[4:06:21] <%Solidnick18> it's always a good time
[4:06:21] <venomfury86> take a breather
[4:06:23] <Visorak6> his practice is paying off
[4:06:25] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> WOOLIE DOESN'T DESERVE YOUR SWEAT!
[4:06:28] <Robot_Nixon_> your enthusiasm is nice
[4:06:29] <dfs_k> this is just the beginning
[4:06:30] <DeathByPoke7> Darlington the demon slayer
[4:06:32] <%MichaelDood> SNEKS Kreygasm
[4:06:33] <$legacy0117> Aw, just before the fun. It'll be a good start though
[4:06:36] <heart_ablaze> the woolie behind the slaughte
[4:06:37] <%jiggy_snipe> Reggie, great job with the backseating on that one encounter
[4:06:39] <Tucker0603> Y U no like SNEK?
[4:06:40] <%GeneralSCPatton> Reggie, you're doing a great job being a second pair of eyes and tracking cooldowns
[4:06:42] <+Ether101_Prime> Remember, you can always change the difficulty on the Pause Menu.
[4:06:44] <%Superbro64> Did you decompress from Dokapon successfully?
[4:06:45] <+Goblin01> reggie! you play any fps like this before?
[4:06:45] <%FboyDaKing> Reggie I know you can see this. The controller is all yours.
[4:06:46] <+catburger100> doom is the greatest demon killer of all time
[4:06:46] <%NickHatesSnow> You're a good hypeman Reggie
[4:06:47] <%GoldeNOVA> Reggie you ever tried playing Cody in SFIV?
[4:06:49] <$realm_forge> I’m Makin some BADASS fan art right now
[4:06:51] <Kidbizzaro> What's your favorite demon?
[4:06:51] <DatAsuna> In a sci-fi game Reggie would be the AI chip in woolie's helmet
[4:07:00] <Darren716> Just wait until THEY show up
[4:07:01] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:07:02] <+Goblin01> theres soooo much all at once!!
[4:07:07] <mark_collins45> Reggis is VEGA
[4:07:08] <%jiggy_snipe> Reggie's Navi Kappa but not annoying
[4:07:09] <emeraldskrull> the only doom that's being faced right now is the toilet
[4:07:12] <invader_rin> I want to replay this game so much, put I'm PC
[4:07:18] <Robot_Nixon_> real-time combat puzzles PogChamp
[4:07:22] <%Shishi1205> Remember grenades don't share the cooldown, with ice granades the normal ones get forgoten
[4:07:25] <%Solidnick18> lock on from the launcher helps with the sneks
[4:07:31] <+DesertPenguin> Reggie, you should try playing Doom
[4:07:32] <SyLuX45> So many tools at your disposal and you don’t even have everything yet lol
[4:07:32] <venomfury86> Doom slayer's Vergil
[4:07:44] <+catburger100> I recommend you to upgrade your armor
[4:07:45] <$BrazenMask> yeah you gotta switch from an offensive strategy to a defensive one in like a split second with this game
[4:07:45] <+Truebluemc> are you planning playing Doom Eternal?
[4:07:53] <Yummy_Nukes> Channel your inner rage Woolie!
[4:08:01] <ralphfromdk> Honestly, it's mostly hard because Woolie is not that great with his controller aim. If you could do a Half Life here, it would work better.
[4:08:01] <%FboyDaKing> If it helps. You want to kill the big monsters. Used the small ones as resource.
[4:08:02] <Robot_Nixon_> just jump 4Head
[4:08:05] <%jiggy_snipe> lol
[4:08:12] <+VidulaSaix> Yeah some of chat was backseating like every single goddamn room
[4:08:14] <heartlesshealer> It's fine, we were just hyped up for pit
[4:08:15] <%Solidnick18> lol
[4:08:16] <%MrRabbles> if you do not exist in linear time
[4:08:18] <invader_rin> It's his FIRST time chat
[4:08:18] <TheyCallMeVawn> Always expect this with Woolie and shooters Kappa
[4:08:24] <%mitchteck> I find that putting grenade switch on left stick click works really well
[4:08:34] <%kyh9> Non-Precogs, BTFO
[4:08:36] <%Javaa01> Just embrace the loving care of the Hole
[4:08:37] <%jiggy_snipe> Woolie is a cautious dude
[4:08:49] <+Aziz9394> Aziz9394 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[4:08:59] <Darren716> Yo Woolie just saw the titles and description on the new Dokapon parts, good shit!
[4:09:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> @ralphfromdk To be fair, I used to be good at console FPS, but sucked ass when I impulse bought Titanfall 2. Mouse makes you forget how to right stick.
[4:09:05] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> STRIKE
[4:09:05] <$legacy0117> People are always going to try, just to want acknowledgement.
[4:09:05] <awalr> do a flip
[4:09:05] <Batmagoo> Yeah I jumped around too at first
[4:09:06] <UvBenServed> DO A FLIP
[4:09:06] <Darren716> Do a flip!
[4:09:07] <%Shishi1205> To be fair it was intended to be a "death" pit LUL
[4:09:08] <%Solidnick18> Just do it tho
[4:09:08] <invader_rin> "Why haven't you beat the game already?"
[4:09:09] <tuesti> LUL
[4:09:12] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> STRIKE
[4:09:12] <Brutalyte616> Woolie seems to have this misconception that shooting the enemy's weakpoints eliminates their threat. The demons can still shoot fireballs because they have bullshit extra-dimensional magic, and the tech just lets them focus the energy better.
[4:09:13] <turbofolk> its fine its fine its fine its fine
[4:09:14] <venomfury86> that video of the guy doing Ultra Nightmare no damage run with a controller is crazy
[4:09:16] <+veraverse> But do it tho
[4:09:17] <heartlesshealer> bellyflop

[4:10:20] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Wow Fallout ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper NotLikeThis
[4:10:24] <+catburger100> theres a Easter egg in doomslayer room
[4:10:25] <raikagelord1> That was a nice way of saying screw off if your an A-Hole. Just because you may have got it faster doesn’t mean everyone will.
[4:10:29] <heartlesshealer> ???

[4:10:49] <asurite_warrior> @WoolieVersus I hope I dont sound angry to yelly on this, and my intention is to be helpful not Grrrr do right. I always find it hard to put toneation into my messages.
[4:10:50] <%jiggy_snipe> I think cuz he's a dork
[4:10:50] <+catburger100> theres a book that reflects on markiplier

[4:11:00] <%Irridium> LUL
[4:11:06] <%Shishi1205> woolieCHAN woolieCHAN
[4:11:09] <+maenos2> god i hate my name becoming a meme.
[4:11:11] <tuesti> he wants to see isabel
[4:11:11] <$legacy0117> "That guy" is stereotype than unfortunately never end, as it has existed since forever.
[4:11:12] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> DOOMguy wants to sell turnips!
[4:11:13] <heartlesshealer> KAL-El? Superman? Fortress of Solitude????
[4:11:24] <+Ether101_Prime> One of the books is shout out to one of the fan's late father. Plus, there's a picture of his family in the Fortress of DOOM.
[4:11:30] <+veraverse> CARL? DETROIT BECOME HUMAN?
[4:11:32] <fruit_pie_the_magician> He sure as fuck isn't playing Doom Eternal multiplayer
[4:11:44] <DeathByPoke7> this game has a lot of buttons
[4:11:47] <+DesertPenguin> You don't have to look, just do it and if it's not ready yet try again in a second
[4:11:49] <mdkcde> sound cue is the best way to play
[4:11:50] <%jiggy_snipe> that's true co-piloting
[4:11:54] <+DesertPenguin> And they make sounds too
[4:11:54] <%Shishi1205> Imagine Donguri in Doom Kreygasm
[4:11:58] <Cykron> Kyle is that insane kid who drinks monsters, snorts coke and kills cats after huffing paint
[4:12:06] <mdkcde> there are sound cues for every cooldown
[4:12:10] <+catburger100> are u excited about the doom dlc
[4:12:17] <mdkcde> chant means bloodpunch is ready
[4:12:18] <+veraverse> woolieSHOOK
[4:12:19] <+frankthetank285> what do you mean you cant juggle everything people have beaten this game by them selves
[4:12:20] <%Amardeux> LUL
[4:12:20] <Darren716> Oh yeah remember to switch nades during the cooldown
[4:12:20] <+Nallex9> Yeah flame took a while to get used to
[4:12:21] <Batmagoo> that's fair LUL
[4:12:21] <+DesertPenguin> If you get the Equipment Fiend rune, you will have your grenades as often as you feel like you should
[4:12:27] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Just count your ammo mentally, OBVIOUSLY /s
[4:12:30] <%FboyDaKing> @cykron I thought that was pat. Minus the cat thing.
[4:12:31] <+Das_Prints> There is that drowning throat singing sound that plays when blood punch is charged. The sound can get a bit lost in the noise of the fight.
[4:12:32] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @WoolieVersus This is now a co op game in which Reggie is your Rally Car co-driver watching all your cooldowns
[4:12:33] <Robot_Nixon_> remember to do thing 4Head
[4:12:37] <Brutalyte616> Reggie and Woolie are piloting the Jaeger that is the Doom Slayer.
[4:12:45] <+DesertPenguin> Equipment Rune is the best shit for that
[4:12:51] <Batmagoo> Guys, he is at the 3rd level. Stop pressuring on mechanics. He'll get them
[4:12:52] <heartlesshealer> so much reflective blood
[4:12:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> Also, frag and ice nades have separate cooldowns
[4:12:53] <mdkcde> drift compatible
[4:12:54] <%alpacasintophats> A note for you woolie: the ice bomb and the frag grenade are on different cooldowns. You can use one and then use the other
[4:12:58] <Darren716> Woolie needs the JP Tresspasser system where the game counts your ammo after each shot
[4:13:02] <$legacy0117> Oh they just paused. ^^
[4:13:05] <%GoldeNOVA> Reggie is the Otacon
[4:13:12] <+kewlmyc> I'm the map
[4:13:14] <+catburger100> parkour
[4:13:26] <%Shishi1205> Dash alley
[4:13:28] <%Javaa01> Or Argent or whatever they use here
[4:13:36] <+frankthetank285> plus the juggle everything is my biggest problem with this game its just do the check list instead of play the game
[4:13:43] <+DesertPenguin> Doomguy climbs like a squirrel
[4:13:53] <%Javaa01> Quickdraw
[4:13:55] <%Javaa01> Absolutely
[4:13:55] <+Das_Prints> It’s pretty fun having to manage everything at once but it can get exhausting on some of the higher difficulties since you have to be focused for so much of it.
[4:13:56] <%Josef_Stryker> LUL
[4:13:58] <+catburger100> armor
[4:13:59] <Brutalyte616> "You don't see Map helping you get rid of these bodies, do ya?"
[4:14:00] <%Solidnick18> armor
[4:14:01] <+DesertPenguin> yes
[4:14:01] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1262613184097255426
[4:14:04] <+DesertPenguin> YES TO THAT
[4:14:07] <%Solidnick18> nice and even
[4:14:09] <+DesertPenguin> armor
[4:14:10] <+dmtjinni> Woolz
[4:14:14] <Darren716> Also battery get
[4:14:19] <%Shishi1205> time for challenge
[4:14:19] <+Nallex9> i like this UI color
[4:14:43] <%GeneralSCPatton> I think the barrel stuff is best
[4:14:47] <%FboyDaKing> I love how if you put a 3rd perspective on doomguy during the climbing. You see Just two big arms around doomguy.
[4:14:52] <Darren716> Grenade cooldown?
[4:14:53] <Batmagoo> the Ui color is funky
[4:14:55] <KeystoneA2> environmental stuff for the barrels is best
[4:14:55] <%Solidnick18> pinata maybe
[4:14:55] <+Aeoneth> Weapon/MOd Switch is strong
[4:14:56] <%Javaa01> The Dash Recharge upgrade halves recharge time on it
[4:15:00] <Darren716> just barrels
[4:15:04] <dfs_k> it doesn't include rockets
[4:15:07] <%Solidnick18> for ammo barrels
[4:15:09] <%Javaa01> So the Dash Recharge is incredible
[4:15:11] <%Shishi1205> demonic summoning of barrels
[4:15:12] <%FboyDaKing> Nope
[4:15:15] <Kejang> fucking LUL
[4:15:17] <SyLuX45> Just barrels
[4:15:24] <%FboyDaKing> Rocket explosion is still present.
[4:15:33] <%Solidnick18> thicc doom
[4:15:36] <+catburger100> that gore nest it helps u beat the demonic precsin
[4:15:39] <Robot_Nixon_> I too like to fire and forget
[4:15:39] <Kejang> not maxing fundamentals NotLikeThis
[4:15:49] <+brightman42> just having that ability in the recentish 2016 run would make it even harder to not blast barrels point blank
[4:15:57] <%Javaa01> Kill a jobber and then use missiles on a big boy
[4:16:10] <zocano> There is a distressing lack of rocket launcher play so far but otherwise Woolie is doing good
[4:16:13] <zocano> He is learning
[4:16:21] <+meatmaaan> @kejang I feel ur pain
[4:16:33] <%FboyDaKing> Rocket will guide you to victory. You will see.
[4:16:39] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I can't remember what game had the most satisfying self kills. I may have killed myself as a demoman in TF2 while taking like 6 guys with me
[4:16:43] <KeystoneA2> Amber is pretty but it doesn't have many colors for the unique functions
[4:16:54] <invader_rin> Time
[4:16:55] <%FboyDaKing> Helped out for me against a certain boss 😏
[4:16:56] <%Solidnick18> oh
[4:16:57] <+brightman42> damn
[4:16:58] <CoffeeSlice> huh
[4:17:01] <%Amardeux> deleted LUL
[4:17:04] <%Lightwolfe> get fucked
[4:17:04] <%Shishi1205> cueballs are good
[4:17:06] <KeystoneA2> use the cueballs
[4:17:06] <%Josef_Stryker> RIP
[4:17:11] <CoffeeSlice> hmm
[4:17:20] <%GeneralSCPatton> Punch them splodey boys
[4:17:27] <zocano> Most of the secret encounters are rough early on
[4:17:28] <%MichaelDood> WOAH
[4:17:30] <%FboyDaKing> If he dies, he dies.
[4:17:35] <asurite_warrior> energy pinball missile is how I did it
[4:17:41] <zocano> Before you are kitted out
[4:17:46] <KeystoneA2> @zocano that encounter in Nekravol with the Marauder tho
[4:18:14] <fruit_pie_the_magician> All right demons. I'm just going to do THIS. And if you get killed, it's your OWN FAULT
[4:18:17] <zocano> I had the hardest time with the one on this level I believe
[4:18:18] <%Josef_Stryker> Only if u have the fuel for it
[4:18:20] <venomfury86> @keystonea2 oh god, that one
[4:18:21] <%Shishi1205> there you go
[4:18:21] <%trustycoyote> Take more gas, but yes
[4:18:21] <%Lightwolfe> yeyyeyee
[4:18:22] <Darren716> Yes but you need fuel
[4:18:22] <dfs_k> it does reggie
[4:18:24] <zocano> In the tiny room
[4:18:25] <%Solidnick18> yes if you have fuel for it
[4:18:29] <DeathByPoke7> you need 3 fuel
[4:18:31] <%Irridium> @KeystoneA2 ah yes, the "git gud REAL fast" challenge"
[4:18:33] <Yummy_Nukes> yes but you need three pips of fuel
[4:18:37] <+DesertPenguin> Okay, this is a challenge room. You get a few guys at a time and those explosive guys pop in with each round
[4:18:39] <asurite_warrior> chainchaw
[4:18:42] <CoffeeSlice> chainchow
[4:18:43] <+DesertPenguin> Use chainsaw for little guys
[4:18:51] <%Javaa01> You need a full 3 charges to delete a Heavy, which is a massive waste
[4:18:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> You need 3 pips, and you only regenerate the last 1
[4:18:53] <CoffeeSlice> LUL
[4:19:04] <%Javaa01> And you CANNOT chainsaw Super Heavies at all
[4:19:05] <KeystoneA2> Prowlers taking 3 is still dumb
[4:19:06] <%Irridium> I do like to use chainsaw for big guys if I got it. Nice to just delete a snek when I need to
[4:19:14] <Batmagoo> chainsaw for 3 is for speedruns and UN strats really
[4:19:14] <Yummy_Nukes> the kills are pretty good though
[4:19:15] <%alpacasintophats> I'm of a different opinion
[4:19:22] <+meatmaaan> yeah heavy chainsaw kills was basically just a panic button
[4:19:25] <Darren716> Theres a better 1 hit ko later
[4:19:26] <%alpacasintophats> I save for 3 and use it to delete a big problem
[4:19:29] <Speccu_> thats true until you start doing ultra nightmare runs in which case you start figuriong out how to route around chainsaw ammo drops to eliminate big dudes
[4:19:33] <+DesertPenguin> This room took me so long
[4:19:42] <+DesertPenguin> Nope
[4:19:44] <%alpacasintophats> and I never grab a gas can while I have a pip recharging
[4:19:47] <Darren716> Yeah this took me a minute to figure it
[4:19:48] <%Javaa01> Look at the other elevator
[4:19:54] <%Shishi1205> Joel actually skiped this room somehow
[4:20:07] <%GeneralSCPatton> This room is going to be a big mindfuck for Woolz
[4:20:12] <Speccu_> @alpacasintophats i hate when i accidentally grab a fuel can while my pip is almost fully recharged because i had a brain fart
[4:20:15] <turbofolk> here we go
[4:20:20] <turbofolk> brain time
[4:20:20] <+mechslayer71> I’m not gonna front, this puzzle (the part with the climb wall) fucked me up for a while
[4:20:23] <Tha_Mik> Big chomps
[4:20:25] <+meatmaaan> ah doom eternal my favourite platformer
[4:20:27] <+DesertPenguin> Clearly the wrong gun for those guys
[4:20:28] <%Javaa01> Yeah they can shoot in bursts now
[4:20:37] <Batmagoo> Tomato chomps owo
[4:20:37] <%Lightwolfe> it cant be that hard to switch guns lmao
[4:20:39] <%alpacasintophats> @Speccu_ doing that sucks. Especially when it's in a slayer gate
[4:20:40] <%Javaa01> So grenade launcher them before they get the chance
[4:20:42] <zocano> Ya they changed the chainsaw loop a lot for this; I think the enemy economy is just a tad bit off with having to need the respawning fodder for chainsaw
[4:20:53] <zocano> Chainsaw targets
[4:21:00] <Darren716> I didnt find that ledge for so long
[4:21:05] <+DesertPenguin> This room is only progression
[4:21:06] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:21:06] <%Javaa01> You want progression, you're cleared out
[4:21:12] <+DesertPenguin> You're good
[4:21:14] <Darren716> You got everything so far
[4:21:16] <%Javaa01> And this leads upstairs
[4:21:19] <RunningNGunning> keep going you're good
[4:21:19] <Speccu_> wololie remembers he has fast travel at the end of the level right?
[4:21:23] <%Irridium> remember you do unlock fast travel
[4:21:23] <%alpacasintophats> upstairs is progression
[4:21:24] <%Shishi1205> woolieF woolieU
[4:21:25] <zocano> Woolie is allergic to progression
[4:21:40] <Darren716> its a monkey bar
[4:21:42] <+DesertPenguin> Hall wugging time
[4:21:46] <%Javaa01> Swing-Shoot-Dash-Dash-Grab
[4:21:50] <invader_rin> BIG BRAIN TIME
[4:21:54] <Darren716> oh no
[4:21:58] <%Irridium> well that was an unfortunate miss
[4:21:58] <%Solidnick18> time to think
[4:21:59] <%Lightwolfe> brainlet time
[4:22:03] <%Josef_Stryker> Oh no here we go
[4:22:05] <Darren716> I tried doing this exact thing for like 5 minutes
[4:22:05] <+DesertPenguin> Like I said, this room took me a long time lol
[4:22:07] <Tha_Mik> Big skips
[4:22:20] <%Shishi1205> check the other side
[4:22:20] <raikagelord1> So question to everwho would be down to watching Woolie show the highlights of his training and him getting stuff he missed?
[4:22:26] <%Lightwolfe> overanalyze time
[4:22:30] <daemonazaezal> there was a bar from the other room
[4:22:34] <dfs_k> and we're back with the regular "let's sequence break the intended progression" program
[4:22:36] <Darren716> Yeah woolie you had it
[4:22:40] <daemonazaezal> like you exited too quick
[4:22:46] <daemonazaezal> from the underground area
[4:22:46] <+aceleapc> how is woolie not able to get this, i think it's pretty well sign posted
[4:22:49] <turbofolk> ok im gonna come back later
[4:22:52] <Brutalyte616> I'll say... 5 minutes to figure this out.
[4:22:52] <+DesertPenguin> It was downstairs
[4:22:54] <%alpacasintophats> woolie you activated a swing earlier
[4:22:56] <turbofolk> spare me the pain
[4:22:57] <%GeneralSCPatton> A button is never nothing
[4:22:58] <RunningNGunning> You should go back to the oatmeal cookie room
[4:22:59] <+DesertPenguin> That's my only hint
[4:23:01] <%Javaa01> The point of the button is to let you dash across to that climbable wall you can see through the gate
[4:23:03] <%alpacasintophats> when you got back up from downstairs
[4:23:06] <Darren716> He totally didnt see the yellow bar didnt he?
[4:23:09] <zocano> Tbf I’ve seen a lot of ppl overthink this
[4:23:14] <zocano> Like a lot
[4:23:29] <%Shishi1205> there you go
[4:23:29] <+Dragoneye77> I cant believe John Madden Wooliegton is still this early on in doom
[4:23:31] <+DesertPenguin> IT takes a minute to get used to the game icons telling you what they do
[4:23:32] <%Solidnick18> he got it damn
[4:23:33] <%ChoculaUltra> he got it!
[4:23:34] <daemonazaezal> JEEEEZZZZZZ
[4:23:37] <cipher758> sick
[4:23:37] <+DesertPenguin> The punch one and the bar are new
[4:23:39] <daemonazaezal> ding ding ding
[4:23:44] <Tha_Mik> Let's go
[4:23:54] <+DesertPenguin> TADAAA
[4:23:54] <Darren716> I got the secret and assumed the bottom was just optional
[4:24:27] <+DesertPenguin> Sticky Grenades dude
[4:24:41] <%13ry4n93> 13ry4n93 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 4 month streak! is there anything less calming than a voice being broadcasted over a loudspeaker asking you to "please remain calm"?
[4:24:57] <%Lightwolfe> Stickies>ordinary shells
[4:25:03] <+DesertPenguin> And shoot just as fast
[4:25:04] <%Lightwolfe> always
[4:25:10] <Batmagoo> It's time to enter the bone zone
[4:25:20] <+meatmaaan> combat shotgun? I only see a grenade launcher
[4:25:34] <%lewdskeletor13> 300IQ
[4:25:36] <%Javaa01> This area is clear now
[4:25:36] <%FuqBoiSlim> did they get the SSG yet?
[4:25:41] <+DesertPenguin> nope

[4:27:53] <memes_are_cancer> No John, you are the demons
[4:27:53] <%zenith0111> Because DOOM totally needs multiplayer Kappa
[4:27:54] <Speccu_> battlemode is fun it just needs more ability builds for demons imo
[4:27:57] <%tearfuldevil> jsut needs summon swords
[4:28:08] <venomfury86> Skeleton Warriors!!!
[4:28:08] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:28:15] <a_mad_dragon> no punch?
[4:28:24] <awalr> @gatorafan but then revenant ceases to be!
[4:28:27] <invader_rin> Battlemode doesn't even have music, the thing that makes DOOM, DOOM
[4:28:27] <+meatmaaan> !MOTIVATED
[4:28:27] <@Moobot> 1173 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[4:28:27] <+Ether101_Prime> Should Woolie kill this guy?
[4:28:28] <+DesertPenguin> Multiplayer should just be like old school Quake or Unreal Tournament. Why is it so hard to get a modern console version of that arena-style multiplayer?
[4:28:31] <Robot_Nixon_> become the doot doot
[4:28:31] <+dmtjinni> LUL
[4:28:35] <resloxxx> LUL
[4:28:36] <%Javaa01> Except this is way more effective

[4:28:55] <%tearfuldevil> id play some multiplayer of it cassually
[4:29:03] <Darren716> Like i tried the battlemode, each of the demons is pretty fun to play
[4:29:09] <%Solidnick18> SourPls
[4:29:09] <venomfury86> Glory kills as a demon would be cool
[4:29:13] <MayorRev> SourPls
[4:29:13] <+DesertPenguin> But it's not balanced
[4:29:17] <+TheOneCalledRock> @DesertPenguin the worst part about it is that doom 2016 was just that. a quake style mutiplayer
[4:29:20] <Darren716> I wish each had their own challenge room or something instead
[4:29:24] <+robertoszek> COOLDOWN CITY
[4:29:28] <+TheOneCalledRock> i have no idea why they did a downgrade in etenral
[4:29:36] <+DesertPenguin> @TheOneCalledRock Yea it was as close as we got

[4:38:22] <Darren716> 5 hours is generous
[4:38:23] <DSD24> They shouldn't show that image till you actually meet the enemy
[4:38:25] <+OUTheTeam> @woolieversus you can whip around with the shotty. you can also use your chainsaw on the demon you hook on to
[4:38:28] <%Shishi1205> Soldya boy
[4:38:34] <%ChoculaUltra> ugh, this game looks amazing but I'm a PC player.
[4:38:52] <%tearfuldevil> @ChoculaUltra does bethesda deserve your moeny?

[4:39:00] <+TheOneCalledRock> @ChoculaUltra fucking rip FeelsBadMan
[4:39:17] <%tearfuldevil> torrent and torrent until it is done
[4:39:19] <+Aeoneth> just wait for the Denuvo removal mod
[4:39:26] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus You can chainsaw a frozen enemy, so when you have "Frozen enemies drop health" that means you can chainsaw a frozen enemy to get Health, Armor AND Ammo at once
[4:39:27] <%ChoculaUltra> it's a pirate's way for me, I suppose.
[4:39:40] <fruit_pie_the_magician> ALso PS4 will be cheap AF pretty soon
[4:39:45] <resloxxx> wasnt the crack leaked by bethesda themselves?
[4:39:46] <soller123> >giving money to Bethesda
[4:39:50] <%Javaa01> If you light the frozen enemy on fire
[4:39:54] <%Irridium> @resloxxx sure was
[4:39:54] <+TheOneCalledRock> i got a gaming PC for the first time and doom eternal was one of the first games i got LUL
[4:39:55] <resloxxx> as in the original .exe was included
[4:39:56] <CoffeeSlice> check the lore of the super shotty
[4:40:00] <mark_collins45> nailed it
[4:40:03] <%ChoculaUltra> can ya use the meathook to shoot at monkey bars?
[4:40:06] <+DesertPenguin> Almost done? I gotta go pe
[4:40:12] <DSD24> Nah you can't @ChoculaUltra
[4:40:15] <%Mrthefro> Denuvo shit happened two missions away from the end woolieMIRIN

[4:42:31] <%MrRabbles> spider monkey doom slayer
[4:42:33] <venomfury86> you can also drift around
[4:42:39] <zocano> This fucking secret encounter coming up
[4:42:41] <+Das_Prints> You can swing around them if you aim to the sides while getting pulled in like a Titanfall grapple.
[4:42:42] <zocano> Is a motherfucker
[4:42:46] <Halospaz117> Oh god this secret encounter

[4:43:26] <RunningNGunning> This one is a toughy

[4:43:33] <Halospaz117> FUCK THAT ENCOUNTER
[4:43:34] <%trustycoyote> Yeah.... this challenege can be rough
[4:43:37] <Ner234> YUP
[4:43:38] <zocano> Yep
[4:43:39] <%gatorafan> The fuckroom
[4:43:41] <chumbucket6789> This is actually impossible on nightmare
[4:43:42] <zocano> That’s about right
[4:43:42] <%FuqBoiSlim> melted
[4:43:43] <invader_rin> One of the harder challenges\
[4:43:45] <Kidbizzaro> Gotta freeze and rocket. But yeah, that's the fuckroom.
[4:43:46] <+meatmaaan> this one ain't bad compared to later one lol
[4:43:46] <Ner234> PARTY ROOM
[4:43:46] <gunsrlove> Rockets
[4:43:48] <%lewdskeletor13> There’s a technique for this one
[4:43:48] <+Aeoneth> Fatty fucks up the floor
[4:43:49] <Darren716> btw do all that climbing shit again
[4:43:50] <%tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus first, save your mines, second, you can Titanfall swing on your grapple
[4:43:54] <%alpacasintophats> gonna want to have a blood punch ready
[4:43:56] <%zenith0111> Use snatch to keep your air time extended! PogChamp
[4:43:56] <%Amardeux> jesus that room LUL
[4:43:58] <KeystoneA2> You haven't seen shit until Nekravol, Wools
[4:43:59] <SainEdge> second worst secret fight
[4:44:01] <+mechslayer71> It’s really not that hard, even on UV. He can do it on HMP
[4:44:05] <zocano> I think this is the quick encounter of the game
[4:44:08] <zocano> Personally
[4:44:11] <+Das_Prints> Rockets and grenades the encounter.
[4:44:15] <Ner234> Oh no, not the FUCK room ...
[4:44:17] <%Solidnick18> saved
[4:44:20] <zocano> I didn’t restart anywhere as much as this one
[4:44:24] <%lewdskeletor13> Some the secret encounters in the late game are just... hoo boy
[4:44:32] <+aspirationdeath> @chumbucket6789 explosive balls are your friend
[4:44:38] <+meatmaaan> the barrels help with this one
[4:44:40] <+OfficerMods> woolie knows the meathoom keeps his inertia right?
[4:44:45] <turbofolk> Legendary shit aim
[4:44:47] <zocano> If you know how to deal with a certain boy quick it’s not too bad later @lewdskeletor13
[4:44:48] <Robot_Nixon_> glad to know everyone struggle at about the same spots LUL
[4:44:51] <+Das_Prints> @zocano same. Going through this on nightmare the first time took some doing.
[4:45:03] <venomfury86> using a chainsaw on an enemy gives you few seconds to check if the blood punch and the equipment are ready
[4:45:08] <%Shishi1205> useless
[4:45:11] <%Javaa01> PUNCH DOES NO DAMAGE
[4:45:14] <DSD24> Its the worst actually
[4:45:16] <%GeneralSCPatton> WE TOLD YOU IT DOES NO DAMAGE
[4:45:16] <%Lightwolfe> then dont keep doing that stumbo
[4:45:18] <RunningNGunning> Punch is useless unless BLOOD PUNCH
[4:45:19] <%alpacasintophats> punch = 0 damage
[4:45:20] <grimshuck> save the mines
[4:45:22] <Kidbizzaro> The only punch is Blood Punch
[4:45:30] <%lewdskeletor13> @zocano Yeah that ones not too bad if you got the strat down. Others are still fucky
[4:45:30] <+meatmaaan> dash does more damage than punch
[4:45:31] <KeystoneA2> reload can be remedied with upgrade
[4:45:32] <%Amardeux> don't blow up the barrels
[4:45:34] <%Irridium> rockets and plasma are what I used for this one
[4:45:36] <%FuqBoiSlim> Its takes 100 punches to bring a regular zombie mook into stagger state
[4:45:37] <%tearfuldevil> @OfficerMods doesn't seem like it
[4:45:40] <+VidulaSaix> 69 nice
[4:45:41] <%zenith0111> Reload Animation Cancel! PogChamp
[4:45:43] <%Lightwolfe> bomb keep
[4:45:43] <Darren716> you can move the mines actually
[4:45:47] <zocano> I find whiplashes the hardest enemies to deal with honestpy
[4:45:49] <FirewallStorm> nice
[4:46:01] <zocano> The boys are predictable and that makes them easier for me
[4:46:06] <CoffeeSlice> dam
[4:46:07] <%lewdskeletor13> Yeah melee got nerfed so blood punch could work
[4:46:07] <%Solidnick18> Such fun
[4:46:10] <%alpacasintophats> you can move the mines?
[4:46:10] <%zenith0111> He saved it then wasted it LUL
[4:46:13] <RunningNGunning> Rockets are helpful I've found in that room
[4:46:13] <Halospaz117> The whiplash mancubus combo is so fucked in those tight quarters
[4:46:16] <gunsrlove> Tha mancubus is the problem
[4:46:22] <%Javaa01> You're sleeping on the Mancubus, never sleep on the Mancubus
[4:46:24] <%lewdskeletor13> It’s a hard one
[4:46:26] <DSD24> I wish default melee at least did some damage rather than 0
[4:46:27] <%Javaa01> Or you JUST die
[4:46:28] <MayorRev> the vocals
[4:46:30] <Halospaz117> Honestly if you came back to this encounter with cheats or more powerful weapons I wouldn't even be upset
[4:46:31] <+meatmaaan> dash is the real default melee
[4:46:34] <%FuqBoiSlim> the fuckin flamethrowers man NotLikeThis
[4:46:36] <zocano> Freezebomb is your saving grace there
[4:46:41] <%lewdskeletor13> Yeah that might be one you end up doing off stream LUL
[4:46:42] <%Shishi1205> freeze is gut
[4:46:43] <KeystoneA2> before you start it, kick the mines to the entrance near where the mancubus comes
[4:46:44] <%Javaa01> Two Snek
[4:46:47] <DeathByPoke7> you need the ketchup and mustard tech
[4:46:48] <+robertoszek> I wish there was a mod that removed the normal punch, I don't want the slayer throwing that weak ass shit
[4:46:50] <+mechslayer71> Sticky bombs on combat shotgun have splash and destroy weak point @woolieversus
[4:46:52] <KasiCrafter> Explosions?
[4:46:52] <CobaltPhoenix27> just got here whats goin on
[4:46:54] <%alpacasintophats> 2 snakes and 1 fat ass
[4:46:56] <zocano> Focus the mancubus first is what I suggest
[4:47:06] <%alpacasintophats> rooms like that are why I keep 3 gas
[4:47:09] <DSD24> @robertoszek Or at least stunned enemies
[4:47:13] <%FuqBoiSlim> 1 Biggie and 2 Smalls
[4:47:16] <%GeneralSCPatton> Fast travel at end of level with 3 fuel?
[4:47:20] <RogueMinja> Two snakes and one big boy.
[4:47:27] <CobaltPhoenix27> oh THIS challenge, this one was a pain
[4:47:32] <+robertoszek> @DSD24 that would be a nice trade off ye
[4:47:36] <%Josef_Stryker> Oh man this combat challenge kicked my ass for a good while.
[4:47:40] <%tearfuldevil> LUL
[4:47:40] <+meatmaaan> it's on a timer
[4:47:46] <%zenith0111> LUL
[4:47:46] <%tearfuldevil> fuck bench spikes
[4:47:49] <grimshuck> Lock on burst kills the snake quickly, ice grenade the mancubus
[4:47:50] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[4:47:50] <CoffeeSlice> HOBO DEMONS
[4:47:53] <%tearfuldevil> rich people are assholes
[4:47:55] <fruit_pie_the_magician> HOBO DEMENS
[4:47:59] <+greenfall> try freeze then super shotty
[4:48:00] <%lewdskeletor13> UAC would totally do that
[4:48:05] <heartlesshealer> Physics <3
[4:48:06] <KasiCrafter> Lost souls, even
[4:48:14] <Darren716> Put one near mancy
[4:48:14] <%zenith0111> As suppose to the home owning demons LUL
[4:48:20] <mark_collins45> Ooof this one

[4:49:08] <KNWatcher> rockets were the way to go
[4:49:09] <zocano> Nice
[4:49:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> I HATE those bench separators. A while back I heard about someone in LA going around with a saw and sawing those separators off. A hero.
[4:49:12] <%Lightwolfe> das it chief
[4:49:13] <+meatmaaan> punch is useless
[4:49:14] <DeathByPoke7> floe1 floe2

[4:49:35] <gunsrlove> Save
[4:49:36] <CobaltPhoenix27> hey guys remind me, are the freeze nades and regular nades on a shared cooldown or separate?
[4:49:39] <%FuqBoiSlim> @commandersqueaks based
[4:49:40] <Darren716> Get a grenade one
[4:49:42] <+DesertPenguin> do grenade upgrades
[4:49:42] <%Shishi1205> Save maybe

[4:49:48] <CoffeeSlice> save it
[4:49:48] <+DesertPenguin> fuck your fundamentals lol
[4:49:49] <%GeneralSCPatton> Ammo barrels are great, and then add the respawn
[4:49:50] <%tearfuldevil> @CommanderSqueaks i feel bad about pigeon spikes, bench sperators are just the fucking worst
[4:49:52] <SyLuX45> Save for Amber ones
[4:49:52] <CobaltPhoenix27> ok thanks
[4:49:56] <%trustycoyote> @CobaltPhoenix27 Seperate
[4:49:58] <+DesertPenguin> That's great
[4:50:05] <+mechslayer71> Do grenade ones @woolieversus
[4:50:07] <+DesertPenguin> There's also a rune for Blood Punches to drop health
[4:50:24] <Darren716> thats glass btw
[4:50:26] <+meatmaaan> what's wrong with fundamentals lol
[4:50:27] <%lewdskeletor13> So you can get health and armor from frozen enemies at the same time
[4:50:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> @tearknack It's funny cause they had those on an AC unit on the 8th floor of my work. A raven used them to help build her nest.
[4:50:38] <Tucker0603> wait, when did woolz go back to normal UI colors?
[4:50:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> They're really good at holding sticks
[4:50:56] <Darren716> Its not the normal, its the 3rd one, all amber
[4:51:01] <DSD24> I like the Blue Hud
[4:51:05] <Darren716> there is

[4:52:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> Also pidgeon spikes have a use, bird poop is acidic so it can tear paint, damage wood/metal if too much accumulates.
[4:52:09] <+Aeoneth> nah, hooked the imp beside the wall
[4:52:11] <%ChoculaUltra> I could've sworn that 1-up wasn't a ledge. Illusions!

[4:53:20] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I bet if you constantly smeared human poop on something it would do similar things to bird poop. But then again bird poop is fucked up because birds dont pee
[4:53:24] <memes_are_cancer> Do I spy a slayer gate?
[4:53:26] <%Lightwolfe> Woolie
[4:53:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> @tearknack The spikes don't actually hurt the birds.
[4:53:41] <GameOver_Here> Stand on top of the spike lift
[4:53:43] <%tearfuldevil> @CommanderSqueaks yeha but it looks bad
[4:53:54] <%zenith0111> Anti Pigeon seeking javelins
[4:53:56] <%tearfuldevil> @CommanderSqueaks i hate it aestehtically
[4:53:59] <mark_collins45> yee yee yee
[4:54:01] <+TheOneCalledRock> DOOM 2
[4:54:01] <GameOver_Here> Doom 2 track
[4:54:09] <%Javaa01> One of the best Doom 2 tracks
[4:54:11] <Darren716> Theres something on that other crusher too
[4:54:13] <venomfury86> i love this track
[4:54:14] <DSD24> Slayer's Fortress of Privacy
[4:54:16] <%tearfuldevil> nice
[4:54:24] <+DesertPenguin> ha you died
[4:54:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> I remember there's a specific type of paint and a specific angle you can build walls that will reflect pee, I know a few cities have used those to stop people from peeing on walls.
[4:54:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> Apparently they've been very effective.
[4:54:53] <DSD24> I wish using a Extra Life was less jarring
[4:54:56] <%Lightwolfe> cant tell if woolies trolling or not sometimes
[4:55:01] <+DesertPenguin> What's really good is the upgrade that makes frozen enemies take more damage. Really buffs the advantage there
[4:55:06] <awalr> if only there was some sort of display to give you a heads-up of how many resources you have
[4:55:09] <%Javaa01> Now for Episode 2 of Woolie Vs Puzzles
[4:55:19] <%Shishi1205> life up down
[4:55:20] <+DesertPenguin> Shadow Puzzles lol
[4:55:20] <DSD24> Like imagine if Slayer does a TJ Combo esq "I AIN"T DONE YET" when ever you use a life

[4:57:24] <%Irridium> perhaps
[4:57:25] <%Solidnick18> maybe
[4:57:29] <unicron_dominate> Ah the dope fish
[4:57:29] <venomfury86> puzzle
[4:57:29] <+meatmaaan> ding ding ding
[4:57:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie doesn't understand the concept of ugly cute.
[4:57:31] <+robertoszek> mayhaps
[4:57:33] <%Solidnick18> i won't say
[4:57:45] <+DesertPenguin> Too easy
[4:57:46] <%Irridium> 500 IQ
[4:57:48] <+DesertPenguin> Now you're gettin' it
[4:57:51] <CoffeeSlice> ring a ding ding baby
[4:57:53] <%Solidnick18> so smert
[4:58:02] <%BallerSwagBro9k> no not really
[4:58:09] <+DesertPenguin> Use your grenade right after the ice bomb
[4:58:15] <Kirbachev> He thinks the Slayer tires. Point at him, point at him and laugh.
[4:58:19] <+robertoszek> oh, this corridor, I liked this corridor
[4:58:19] <venomfury86> "i'm just getting started"
[4:58:19] <%klholland92> i can do this all day
[4:58:24] <%Javaa01> Yeah you already have the key
[4:58:24] <%newguy95> you got to love that they can be frozen AND on fire
[4:58:28] <+meatmaaan> grenades are stronk
[4:58:30] <%tearfuldevil> hello my honey, hello my baby, hello my rag time doooool
[4:58:37] <+DesertPenguin> hit the icon up top
[4:58:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> "Bitch, I got a coffee drip straight into my VEINS!"
[4:58:40] <+DesertPenguin> see what it does
[4:58:54] <+DesertPenguin> Hit the green button
[4:59:09] <+jerf_herf> shoot teh thing
[4:59:10] <%lewdskeletor13> Shoot ze glass
[4:59:10] <Brutalyte616> SO many other streamers struggled to solve that puzzle.
[4:59:41] <%Lightwolfe> you have to hit it tho
[4:59:47] <+DesertPenguin> Heavy Cannon is better for them
[4:59:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> Imagine a game with Twitch integration that'd let you know how long streamers got stuck at a certain part.
[5:00:07] <+DesertPenguin> He never hit the green button
[5:00:13] <+DesertPenguin> My life is incomplete lol
[5:00:16] <+meatmaaan> ssg is good for everything
[5:00:18] <Tha_Mik> He did once
[5:00:24] <+robertoszek> @CommanderSqueaks with leaderboards

[5:00:55] <%Shishi1205> that's about it

[5:08:15] <%Javaa01> You have such a vast array of tools to help you thrive that they need to crank things up to force you to survive
[5:08:16] <venomfury86> Super Shotgun is the princess
[5:08:18] <%Josef_Stryker> Doom Eternal is very much a character action game in that you really need to learn how to combo ur shit
[5:08:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> Must learn to do combo

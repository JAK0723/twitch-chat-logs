[0:22:43] <mdkcde> It is a necessary evil
[0:22:44] <+DesertPenguin> I thought it was Ming before I saw it in chat
[0:22:45] <+soFISHticated98> ok but the real question? what do you do with the unfertilized ones
[0:22:45] <%NecDW4> @Solidnick18 because i KNOW that will get under his skin
[0:22:46] <$R3Roundabout> Cheer500 Blood for the blood pool! Lets see if Dokapon will destroy you like Kaguya destroyed Naruto lore.
[0:22:46] <%ggbhtg> Cloaca time again, huh
[0:22:47] <%VaguelyKai> So I have been meaning to ask. Salt goes to the winner, but is peace split three ways?
[0:22:49] <hectic_harlequin> Fertilize my eggs uwu
[0:22:50] <waterstealer> this is answered in interspecies reviewers
[0:22:51] <%RioGascar> Oviposition
[0:22:53] <mdkcde> but it is cleaner than placenta
[0:22:54] <%BisoromiBear> You have to eat all the sneggs
[0:22:54] <%nocturne_reverie> in fairness you cant RUN from egg birth
[0:22:55] <%emperordread> Another thing to learn from Interspecies Reviewers
[0:22:57] <+soFISHticated98> peace is split between 2 losers

[0:23:19] <%Fujiwara_92> ya know, he's right
[0:23:19] <+BubbaRands> egg birth is cleaner Kappa
[0:23:19] <Decimated_body> PogChamp
[0:23:20] <%GrassCannon> That's a solid point
[0:23:20] <thesickestzak> Afterbirth
[0:23:21] <+soFISHticated98> yeah but live birth means you don't have to guard your spawn point
[0:23:22] <McGwinnicus> Live birth is totally inefficient
[0:23:22] <%C4m3r0n0409> PLACENTA
[0:23:22] <Solidnick18> UGH

[0:24:00] <The_err0r> Reggie goin for some smokes
[0:24:00] <TheArrow_> i really like the idea of improv history
[0:24:01] <Jetsfantasy> Don't forget, if you give a snek nipples, they should be inverted so slithering doesn't stimulate them while they move
[0:24:02] <Kalixas> Snek is love!
[0:24:03] <%IDGJohn> @vVAstrAVv 😂😂😂
[0:24:04] <+soFISHticated98> we are Philostophers

[0:25:00] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @desertpenguin snek
[0:25:01] <+DesertPenguin> It's all gross dude
[0:25:01] <Kalixas> Egg birth is 100% a Pat thing
[0:25:02] <+soFISHticated98> live birth makes the baby stronger
[0:25:03] <%IDGJohn> Pat would give birth via eggs if he could
[0:25:03] <TheArrow_> i don't understand why we aren't all born in test tubes yet
[0:25:04] <evilaltruistic> please stop
[0:25:05] <Hawkbone_> Can't wait to extrapolate this into Woolie having an unbirthing fetish

[0:26:53] <+black_gift2356> is there a time to beat for this game? i want a grey haired squad playing
[0:26:56] <mcexcadrill> don't let your dreams be memes

[0:27:18] <%Solidnick18> can someone play gold dusts theme shattered dreams.
[0:27:19] <waterstealer> losing means you should never have tried
[0:27:24] <%heroversusofficial> Dreams mean nothing if you don't take action

[0:27:26] <+soFISHticated98> "If we lost, that means we should have never even tried"

[0:27:38] <+DesertPenguin> Yea, I did that for a long time. Too long. Had no guidance
[0:27:39] <%legacy0117> If these guys want to progress it'll end, until suddenly they realize what lengths they'll go to, to win

[0:28:11] <%optimasmaximas> you should ALWAYS try
[0:28:12] <%Fujiwara_92> the lesson is, never try
[0:28:13] <+yukichocomilk> you can't succeed without failing first
[0:28:15] <andrei11dr> Sometimes you can achieve your hopes and dreams by accident
[0:28:17] <+DesertPenguin> You're just saying "Do something"
[0:28:18] <%heroversusofficial> You miss 100% of the raging demons you don't input
[0:28:19] <dapperskeleton69> hopes and dreams are worth less than pocket lint
[0:28:20] <IminyourBase> kill your hopes and dreams because they don't mean shit
[0:28:23] <%Th3SmartAlec> Minh the memelord
[0:28:25] <%gatorafan> The power of dreams is not measured by their frequency but by the speed of the actions taken to make them into reality - Some weird Sanic pic I have on my pc.

[0:37:48] <%gatorafan> A legend one would say
[0:37:48] <%ECRead> reptiles don't lay infertile eggs and they are seasonal, as cold blooded animals being born in winter wouldn't usually be a very good thing

[0:37:51] <@Solidus_113> woolieU_HF woolieU
[0:37:51] <DavidDredd84> Is the OG that good? I started the new one but its unfinbished
[0:37:56] <arkv01> yea you nailed it
[0:37:57] <%legacy0117> That was an off-topic. Yay. ^^
[0:37:57] <+Synthos3> Synthos3 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Blah. I wont know whats happening
[0:37:59] <%deviljhojho_> so close

[0:38:06] <%Kingkaiju0618> ripcheer5500
[0:38:07] <lyriuswolfe14> Will Woolie ever play the Kakarot game from CC2?
[0:38:07] <%ekodrop> no one cares about it though
[0:38:07] <Hawkbone_> One day we'll get it to work
[0:38:08] <%ggbhtg> maybe?
[0:38:11] <%Irridium> btw way actual quote was "well, if it's not gonna work I'll just drink and go to bed" I just fucked up the words but whatev LUL
[0:38:14] <TalisKanju> It's the art style
[0:38:14] <%Fujiwara_92> woolieT_HF woolieT
[0:38:15] <+jiggy_snipe> did people talk about the old one like Woolie talks about it?
[0:38:20] <%GrassCannon> I mean, the fact that no one's complaining about it is encouraging to me
[0:38:29] <phatmac16> It’s okay
[0:38:29] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:38:31] <%Kingkaiju0618> @woolieversus that was for blood
[0:38:33] <$Noponiz> A friend of mine watched it and said he absolutely hated it and dropped it
[0:38:33] <%emperordread> I tried the new one, it was 3 slow 5 me
[0:38:34] <arkv01> the kuroko's basket designs targeted the female market, but the story isn't as hot with them
[0:38:39] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> Unfortunately, some of the older ones broke down and have this newer art to replace. It’s fucking weird
[0:38:41] <%Irridium> I didn't even know the second season was out until like a weak after it finished
[0:38:49] <%ggbhtg> it might be in a niche like Vanguard
[0:38:50] <Daba_mk2> Reinhard cosplay when
[0:38:51] <+blademaster247> Anytime the new one comes up people like you jack off the original and won't acknowledge the new show of fans of it
[0:38:53] <Zebroneath> I'd like to see a replica of Wenli's ship
[0:38:53] <TalisKanju> It's like 100 episodes long, hard to find, has several OVAs
[0:38:56] <%Irridium> god I can't type or spell today huh
[0:38:56] <vVAstrAVv> new one didn't get that far in yet either

[0:58:20] <%emperordread> The black council must never split
[0:58:20] <royb2> Reggie and Woolie keep beating each other while they should solely focus on Minh.
[0:58:20] <mdkcde> Reggie is pushing for the return of Darklington
[0:58:21] <gamewarden92> Why would anyone listen to a man that has just proclaimed his heel turn.
[0:58:22] <+Ignotum42> Reggie is constantly fighting Woolie in last, and just wasted two chances punching down on him *again*. He eats Minh's suggestions cause thinking is HARD

[1:03:09] <%Superdandy96> @kyh9 mmm, that’s way better
[1:03:09] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Shwepie They've been getting various bits of information (and some they haven't mentioned to each other), but they know about Hero and Robo
[1:03:10] <%ggbhtg> that wasnt very cash money of you Minh
[1:03:13] <Orbeii> luck yeah
[1:03:17] <%emperordread> Reggie the boyscout is always prepared
[1:03:20] <worldbrand> but what if you need it later
[1:03:21] <%aka_Jigawatt> Full metal Mihnemist
[1:03:21] <Camail> still got that nitro
[1:03:23] <%legacy0117> May need to alter that. More work for me to fix things. Probably castles counting toward Karma value.
[1:03:26] <%Solidnick18> can't get hit again tho
[1:03:26] <dapperskeleton69> whats the deal with alchemist?
[1:03:31] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[1:03:32] <andrei11dr> For God sakes, go too the temple Reggie
[1:03:38] <CashewZero> it has a chance to duplicate an item in your inventory every turn
[1:03:39] <topendbuzza> oh no
[1:03:42] <Damie904> Alchemist gets stupid money
[1:03:42] <%Th3SmartAlec> OH NO
[1:03:42] <dapperskeleton69> ohhhhh
[1:03:43] <+GenesisKnight> Forest fires LUL
[1:03:43] <+Ignotum42> You can cheat out infinite free money with alchemist
[1:03:43] <%ekodrop> too real
[1:03:47] <BurningSaph> Australia changes a man...
[1:03:50] <Ralfclogs> ooof
[1:03:50] <resloxxx> MON CHERI
[1:03:51] <CashewZero> so you get one revive/deathblock and then a month later you have na inventory full and you cant die
[1:03:52] <%ggbhtg> real in deez streets
[1:03:56] <chaozagents> @dapperskeleton69 you can do some broke ass shit with it's special abilities
[1:03:57] <%Solidnick18> The biggest beast lords around
[1:03:57] <%viewtifulr> dont talk about fires, theres one a hill over from me
[1:03:58] <VJdarkworld> thanks mon cheri
[1:03:59] <%Th3SmartAlec> @BurningSaph But a man doesn't change Austrilia
[1:04:02] <+Burdenslo> The nitroglycerin caused that damage yo!
[1:04:03] <%nintega010> Might actually have to go grind cause the tower they are even stronger
[1:04:05] <Zebroneath> Kaiju battles are happening in the background
[1:04:11] <sonicblade38> what about that horrent in astrialia that can PICK UP the giant spiders
[1:04:12] <Shishi1205> Wait can alchemist clone the big bug
[1:04:12] <muddiestpath> I recognise nothing but I'm here, anime viewer
[1:04:15] <BurningSaph> True that @Th3SmartAlec
[1:04:21] <Shishi1205> So it eats the other one?
[1:04:24] <Brandon__Brando> so any one know how close they are to finishing the game?
[1:04:26] <+soFISHticated98> mo money mo problems
[1:04:26] <Camail> reggie needs that temple ASAP
[1:04:27] <+Dorf1> can you gift the king the nitroglycerin?
[1:04:29] <+Ignotum42> And I feel like that's the real reason Minh prepped the "villain" speech, so he has an excuse to go Alchemist and cheese the money exploit after reading it on the wiki, since he does in the off time.
[1:04:30] <Camail> or else he's fucked
[1:04:30] <%emperordread> 4 crystal = temple
[1:04:30] <topendbuzza> right it was the nitro that fucked him up
[1:04:33] <andrei11dr> The tower ain't even the end
[1:04:37] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @shishi1205 no
[1:04:38] <%gatorafan> Think about it. The Demon Lord saw Australia and said: "yeah, this is great! I'm going to live here now"
[1:04:38] <CashewZero> you can also just cheese the early game area for stupid money, but thats like- deplorable lol
[1:04:43] <Shishi1205> Ok
[1:04:55] <Brandon__Brando> kk
[1:04:55] <+soFISHticated98> how do you get money in asiana?
[1:04:57] <%irfan_> who cares about being deplorable this late in the game
[1:04:58] <%FuqBoiSlim> everyone here is a deplorable so its fine
[1:04:58] <%legacy0117> So, if there is an option to kill Rico big, you guys gonna try to?
[1:05:04] <+Ignotum42> It's deplorable but I still bet Minh will do it
[1:05:10] <%Javaa01> Nitro is heart medication, not a reefer
[1:05:12] <%C4m3r0n0409> POISON

[1:09:07] <%b_aleph> No backdown 2: the bakout
[1:09:07] <%Ashenik1> Would you be suprised that Danube is actaully a river in Europe, more specifically in Balkans which makes it an accurate represenation of that region :d
[1:09:08] <%Amaideus> The temple is named after the dog
[1:09:09] <Hopit> woolieOMG_BW
[1:09:11] <NyxFang> LUL

[1:09:15] <maznuts> BACK TO APRIKA YOU GO
[1:09:17] <+soFISHticated98> nobody would be surprised
[1:09:18] <%legacy0117> But that's what DOOM demons are, that's Chaotic Evil.
[1:09:20] <+soFISHticated98> the danube is a major river
[1:09:23] <%Amaideus> That means there's just a bunch of identical dog priests all around the worldf
[1:09:30] <andrei11dr> In the pantheon of deities, Minh is a Shura ,Woolie is a Æseir ,and Reggie is some shit, i don't know
[1:09:35] <%FuqBoiSlim> DOKAPON: ESCAPE 2 AFRICA
[1:09:37] <DedlokPM> @Ashenik1 no because I also know of the song Blue Danube.
[1:09:41] <%Javaa01> Oh shit, there's a chance here
[1:09:46] <+soFISHticated98> Reggie is a Vanir
[1:09:59] <+soFISHticated98> callous in his heroism
[1:10:00] <+jiggy_snipe> ?
[1:10:00] <DiscoDur0> here we go!!!
[1:10:00] <%Th3SmartAlec> More food for the Bug
[1:10:04] <+GenesisKnight> ALCHEMY
[1:10:05] <%Solidnick18> ?
[1:10:09] <gamewarden92> That bug is gonna be well fed
[1:10:10] <CashewZero> aaaaand heeeere weeee go
[1:10:11] <%BisoromiBear> psaBig DUPES
[1:10:12] <%aka_Jigawatt> EQUIVALENT EXCHANGE
[1:10:16] <%ggbhtg> that's some Pokemon rare candy shit
[1:10:17] <strayed42> Reggie is more like Odysseus, caught in godly politics and getting a few lucky breaks here and there
[1:10:17] <DiscoDur0> i wish lol
[1:10:24] <$StaceMcGate> Feeeeed me
[1:10:31] <+soFISHticated98> odysseus was a dick though
[1:10:36] <%legacy0117> Minh is Lawful Evil, he has a reason for everything he plans for and can plan yomi.
[1:10:39] <strayed42> hmm, true
[1:10:40] <CashewZero> if i remember right the big bug *can* be duplicated, but one just eats the other lol
[1:10:46] <+Ignotum42> And just like Odysseus he's a jerk willing to rough up anyone in the general vincinity
[1:10:49] <%ChoculaUltra> Minhstrumentality.
[1:10:51] <Sedrelic> big dumb
[1:10:52] <$StaceMcGate> woolieDATTEBAYO_TK
[1:10:54] <%Solidnick18> Reggie is not doing much
[1:10:59] <Hawkbone_> Woolie with the contract is more of a threat
[1:11:00] <%nintega010> woolie ain't that far
[1:11:00] <McGwinnicus> cloooose
[1:11:01] <%alephalpha> if it wasn't for the big bug minh could have infinite charm potions
[1:11:02] <Mr_Ease> this is the closest its ever been
[1:11:02] <%ggbhtg> Contracto?
[1:11:07] <+soFISHticated98> woolie is not that far behind so the contract is not good right now
[1:11:16] <%BisoromiBear> Don't let Woolie play those devil games
[1:11:16] <+jiggy_snipe> Woolie could mess everything up if he goes darkling
[1:11:17] <+InfiniteHav0k> But Castle steal and XP
[1:11:17] <Camail> and reggie is weak as fuck so he probably wont be taking towns
[1:11:25] <%KosOrSomeSayKosm_> caring about the contract at the current time would be very dumb
[1:11:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> Also, Woolie should be getting to that tower ASAP
[1:11:27] <thesickestzak> Don't worry Reggie will just keep attacking Woolie because it definitely helps. It has been working this whole game.
[1:11:28] <Camail> OH SHIT
[1:11:29] <%viewtifulr> but a chance to fuck over minh is worth it
[1:11:29] <%Th3SmartAlec> OOF
[1:11:32] <lotharrio> How many stabbings so far?
[1:11:33] <%legacy0117> Woolie, is best described as Neutral Evil, he has an idea of what he wants but sometimes doesn't plan.
[1:11:35] <Camail> thats the safety net
[1:11:35] <%alephalpha> @InfiniteHav0k that's probably put him further behind

[1:13:05] <Butch_DeLoria> The mark of Minh's dignity will scar thy DNA
[1:13:15] <+soFISHticated98> only way to get rid of it without having no items is to force it on someone
[1:13:23] <worldbrand> dump it on blathers
[1:13:25] <+jiggy_snipe> the bug doesn't leave until your bag is empty or you give the bug to someone else
[1:13:27] <+soFISHticated98> shove that bug down their ass
[1:13:31] <McGwinnicus> looter?
[1:13:32] <%deviljhojho_> she probably mugs people
[1:13:34] <dapperskeleton69> "this bug was found in the remnants of a long-abandoned gamestop"

[1:13:52] <+nekodelic> she sucks some rich people's dicks
[1:13:52] <+pectusumbra> I believe the canon is she's the actual op protagonist right?

[1:14:15] <%legacy0117> Reggie is shaking between Chaotic Evil and Chaotic Neutral at this point...His choices have been scatterbrained, but depending on his luck he can be harmless or be absolutely mad rich. It's hard to define.
[1:14:18] <+InfiniteHav0k> Go right to the tower
[1:14:21] <SethKyu> Item store to tower?

[1:16:52] <+prime_name> Reggie was planning for the Rico dodge
[1:16:59] <%emperordread> The mindgame that you have lost every single time?
[1:17:01] <codizle> what's the blood pool currently at?

[1:17:24] <thesickestzak> $3370
[1:17:24] <codizle> :0
[1:17:26] <Electro96> reggie needs to buy better magic defense asap
[1:17:31] <+jiggy_snipe> if Reggie defeated the monster he would level
[1:17:34] <Hawkbone_> Reggie has a better attack stat
[1:17:35] <+mmack093> Reggie would of had his ass kicked
[1:17:35] <+soFISHticated98> so in Dokapon lore how are Rico and Weber related

[1:17:50] <%C4m3r0n0409> Woolie 2 v 1 and won before
[1:17:52] <%Javaa01> Reggie doesn't have a chance against Woolie in a straight fight
[1:17:53] <Hawkbone_> Reggie would kill Woolie with strike, or destroy his equipment with Rust.
[1:17:55] <+soFISHticated98> no Reggie's character absolutely way better in stats
[1:17:55] <%FuqBoiSlim> WOOLIE BUY HIGH AND SELL LOW ITS THE /BIZ/ WAY
[1:17:57] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Since Woolie is footsored cant he just walk back and forth and invest in that town?

[1:22:37] <%Solidnick18> welcome back reggie
[1:22:39] <topendbuzza> only if a 0
[1:22:40] <+PlagueOfGripes> a wonder a 30 hour game never took off.
[1:22:40] <deepaire> !Schedule
[1:22:40] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1255023082869272576
[1:22:41] <%FuqBoiSlim> THE BLOW UPS
[1:22:43] <%C4m3r0n0409> Only if 0
[1:22:50] <+mrcooperblack> Reggie still has the nitro btw
[1:22:59] <DiscoDur0> the trick is to paralyze him to trigger an event
[1:23:02] <KNWatcher> is this like monopoly with extra steps?
[1:23:03] <DiscoDur0> or battle
[1:23:06] <CashewZero> with 3 people if they've never played before a run through of the story mode is 50-80 hours lol
[1:23:08] <andrei11dr> That sucks, you lose time for no reason, typical Atllus
[1:23:14] <%NecDW4> Move Pockets to Minhs spot
[1:23:15] <+jiggy_snipe> it was like it never happened
[1:23:17] <%NecDW4> trap them both
[1:23:23] <%BisoromiBear> Dokapon was ahead of its time
[1:23:28] <DavidDredd84> Oh shit did I miss the fight?
[1:23:31] <%FuqBoiSlim> Did Atlus develop this? or did they publish it?
[1:23:36] <debrv> It sure was....
[1:23:36] <Hawkbone_> Publish
[1:23:39] <Junkles> wish in one hand, salt in the other
[1:23:40] <RurouniGeo> steal reggie
[1:23:41] <%Amaideus> If this takes 50+ hours then there would have to be at least another 7 chapters
[1:23:42] <%fetrigon> Publish
[1:23:46] <%nintega010> Woolie owns australia
[1:23:46] <%emperordread> You can cast twice per round Reggie
[1:23:47] <%Amaideus> And I don't think that's true
[1:23:49] <+PlagueOfGripes> so how do you know if someone has.... won...? or stopped playing?
[1:23:51] <Hawkbone_> I think it had like, 3 publishers, weirdly.
[1:23:55] <%Shwepie> @PlagueOfGripes Imagine playing a 50 turn game of Mario Party, but each turn was an entire game of Risk. That's Dokapon.
[1:23:56] <%KosOrSomeSayKosm_> this game is long yes, but to be fair d&d sessions are also long, and much more popular then this so...hm
[1:23:57] <+PlagueOfGripes> is there a final boss or something
[1:24:03] <starwolfgang> Yes
[1:24:05] <+soFISHticated98> yeah
[1:24:05] <+InfiniteHav0k> There is an end
[1:24:06] <$StaceMcGate> yes Plague
[1:24:06] <Damie904> Yes
[1:24:07] <McGwinnicus> LUL
[1:24:08] <%nintega010> yeah there is a final bos
[1:24:10] <%Solidnick18> Yes
[1:24:10] <Hawkbone_> @PlagueOfGripes You beat the final boss and whoever has the most value wins
[1:24:10] <%Amaideus> Story mode ends when it ends
[1:24:13] <%FuqBoiSlim> Sí
[1:24:13] <%fetrigon> Yes
[1:24:18] <%yeetdabsenpai69> FIGHT WOOLIE
[1:24:21] <+PlagueOfGripes> was it the friends we made along the way
[1:24:21] <RurouniGeo> steal reggie
[1:24:23] <thesickestzak> Yes Minh is the final boss and has been since day 1
[1:24:24] <+soFISHticated98> yes
[1:24:27] <CashewZero> theres 8 chapters, youll see how long the last chapter is, especially if theres money on the line
[1:24:29] <+soFISHticated98> the friends
[1:24:30] <andrei11dr> Take town ?
[1:24:33] <$StaceMcGate> when you fight the FINAL, final boss and win... the game ends
[1:24:34] <+soFISHticated98> "friends"
[1:24:36] <%xcompleasedad> FIGHT TIME
[1:24:40] <%Spydurman> he's gonna get fucked if he fights that town monster
[1:24:41] <Decimated_body> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:24:42] <+jiggy_snipe> enemies
[1:24:43] <%Fujiwara_92> more like the friends lost along the way
[1:24:44] <%fetrigon> Pretty sure he just showed up, cause he looks like a final boss.
[1:24:49] <%gatorafan> I'd totally defeat the friends I made along to way if it means I win
[1:24:50] <%Shwepie> Dokapon Kingdom is the friends we murdered along the way.
[1:24:50] <+InfiniteHav0k> Its like Mario Party when it ends
[1:24:52] <DiscoDur0> @PlagueOfGripes the "normal mode" is better for casual one-offs, preset turns/levels
[1:24:55] <%xcompleasedad> Always the wrong choice
[1:24:55] <%agumon9000> There is one more chapter
[1:24:58] <%djazo> friendship in dokipon LUL
[1:24:59] <+PlagueOfGripes> I remember there being a hot demon girl.
[1:25:02] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @fetrigon nope not yet
[1:25:02] <DiscoDur0> story mode is the long con
[1:25:08] <FboyDaKing> Im gonna regret this but whats the blood pool amount now
[1:25:13] <%xcompleasedad> @PlagueOfGripes Woolie can turn into one
[1:25:14] <CashewZero> chapter 8 literally is hell-- if you want to win
[1:25:22] <%FuqBoiSlim> @fboydaking $3370
[1:25:22] <CashewZero> i mean, unless your an alchemist
[1:25:28] <%agumon9000> The final chapter is an absolute fuck fest that requires a long time of grinding
[1:25:28] <%C24U> Demon Girl you're thinking of is the Darling form of a female player
[1:25:33] <%emperordread> Darkling girl is super cute too
[1:25:38] <%C24U> Darkling*
[1:25:39] <%Fujiwara_92> ^
[1:25:40] <%Shwepie> @PlagueOfGripes Final boss has been spawned, they just need to go murder him to end the game. Person with the highest networth at the end wins.
[1:25:55] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @shwepie not yet
[1:25:57] <CashewZero> thats not the final boss lol rather its only his first form
[1:25:59] <+InfiniteHav0k> @Shwepie there is another chapter after they fight him
[1:26:01] <+Leiru8> woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO
[1:26:02] <%agumon9000> Bad Rolls can turn the final chapter into an endless boss gauntlet with no real checkpoints
[1:26:04] <%C4m3r0n0409> Its not final boss
[1:26:06] <%Fujiwara_92> LUL final boss
[1:26:10] <%FuqBoiSlim> HIS FIRST FORM?????
[1:26:15] <%Amaideus> Of course
[1:26:19] <%Amaideus> What final boss only has one form
[1:26:19] <+InfiniteHav0k> Hes like Cell
[1:26:20] <%C4m3r0n0409> CLOSE GAME

[1:26:49] <%FuqBoiSlim> Spoil me, how many forms does rico sr have?
[1:26:52] <phatmac16> Woolie is catching up
[1:26:54] <+soFISHticated98> @PlagueOfGripes can you make sure people stop posting porn right under your pics without marking their accounts 18+
[1:26:59] <CashewZero> the final chapter is just such a hell because you dont *NEED* to go fight the final boss, a lot of people prefer to just let someone else kill him
[1:27:00] <%FuqBoiSlim> I hope it's at least 3
[1:27:05] <debrv> Wools gotta steal some towns from Minh.
[1:27:09] <leonheartgriever> hi everyone........what is this game?
[1:27:14] <+soFISHticated98> I realize you can't really do anything about it but I don't really want to browse your account if that stuff is there
[1:27:18] <minh2t> who's KICKS?
[1:27:18] <%C4m3r0n0409> Woolie doesn't have to steal
[1:27:20] <DSD24> @leonheartgriever Mario Party but its a RPG
[1:27:22] <The_err0r> Contract darklington
[1:27:25] <%C4m3r0n0409> PSYCHOKINESIS IS NICE
[1:27:29] <Hawkbone_> @soFISHticated98 Plague's account is basically already softcore porn anyway so who cares
[1:27:31] <%xcompleasedad> @leonheartgriever Monopoly where you can kill each other
[1:27:32] <Shishi1205> Feet
[1:27:36] <+mrcooperblack> and now to hit minh
[1:27:37] <debrv> @leonheartgriever It is DOKAPON, BABY!
[1:27:37] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @minh2t reggie
[1:27:37] <%agumon9000> FEET
[1:27:38] <+gutlesscoward> APPLY FEET TO REGGIE
[1:27:40] <%BisoromiBear> BEAT HIS FEET
[1:27:43] <topendbuzza> he is not going for demon
[1:27:44] <+soFISHticated98> there's a difference between a horny clothed pic and a literal hentai pic
[1:27:49] <+soFISHticated98> so I do care
[1:27:49] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:27:50] <minh2t> @yeetdabsenpai69 thanks
[1:27:55] <gamewarden92> No! That would empower Reggie.
[1:27:57] <%nintega010> yeah he has to fight though
[1:27:58] <+jiggy_snipe> lol
[1:27:58] <+soFISHticated98> because one shows a penis
[1:27:59] <Hawkbone_> @soFISHticated98 Both are not safe for work.
[1:28:01] <sunwraith91> what day of the week are we at?
[1:28:02] <+mrcooperblack> stores are CLOSED
[1:28:02] <%KosOrSomeSayKosm_> if he survives the yellow space, that is
[1:28:06] <sunwraith91> oh shit
[1:28:07] <%C4m3r0n0409> NO DONT
[1:28:09] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @debrv
[1:28:10] <+soFISHticated98> there can be degrees of nsfw
[1:28:10] <+jiggy_snipe> 3 to use it
[1:28:15] <+soFISHticated98> not everything that is nsfw is porn
[1:28:18] <%emperordread> What happened to stopping Minh? Kappa
[1:28:18] <Shishi1205> Can only use one item per turn
[1:28:20] <%fetrigon> ResidentSleeper
[1:28:20] <sunwraith91> Who's currently winning
[1:28:23] <%Fujiwara_92> he can move the turn he uses it
[1:28:24] <andrei11dr> I can't believe how long those road blocks last
[1:28:25] <Shishi1205> Worth it?
[1:28:25] <topendbuzza> minh
[1:28:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> @sunwraith91 No one
[1:28:30] <%FuqBoiSlim> Minh is in the lead
[1:28:34] <DiscoDur0> @emperordread the game is stopping him at the moment LUL
[1:28:35] <debrv> THAT. Is Dokapon Kingdom.
[1:28:37] <minh2t> ohh nice
[1:28:43] <Shishi1205> But not with items
[1:28:48] <Hawkbone_> @soFISHticated98 No mean, literally not safe for work. Both are gonna get you fired or punished. Just don't look at Plague's account or comments.
[1:28:54] <sunwraith91> @Th3SmartAlec I mean in rankings
[1:28:57] <strayed42> ResidentSleeper
[1:28:58] <Shishi1205> Its worth it
[1:29:04] <andrei11dr> Woolie always takes 3 million years too move
[1:29:05] <%emperordread> ResidentSleeper
[1:29:08] <+soFISHticated98> I don't care what you think Hawkbone
[1:29:13] <starwolfgang> Tip for investing in towns: the value of the town will double at lvl 3 and triple at lvl 6. It would probably be worth it for Woolie to invest in his new towns to climb rankings.
[1:29:16] <andrei11dr> It's on brand by now
[1:29:17] <%Th3SmartAlec> Oof
[1:29:18] <+soFISHticated98> it's not applicable to my life so stop telling eme what to do
[1:29:20] <%C4m3r0n0409> BLISTERED FEET
[1:29:27] <%Solidnick18> YES
[1:29:27] <Hawkbone_> Stop telling Plague what to do.
[1:29:30] <+soFISHticated98> I do want to look at Plague's stuff, I don't want to look at porn
[1:29:37] <+soFISHticated98> I asked, I didn't tell him what to do
[1:29:41] <+soFISHticated98> and I didn't insult him
[1:29:44] <+soFISHticated98> so fucking stop
[1:29:46] <DSD24> Yo why does Mihn's dude look so dapper
[1:29:49] <Hawkbone_> I didn't insult you
[1:29:49] <gamewarden92> @soFISHticated98 Are you a child?

[2:00:08] <+lucaflowe> What did Reggie forget that he can use field spells two times?

[2:00:35] <mdkcde> "Come back A-NYAH-time"
[2:00:42] <%heartlesshealer> at least a paralyze can keep minh from moving to use charm potion. Maybe
[2:00:48] <+Mekhet09> he should head to the tower of rabble.
[2:00:48] <Shishi1205> Go for the tower?
[2:00:51] <+Mekhet09> That's up.

[2:04:40] <Hawkbone_> This game hates Reggie
[2:04:41] <+paladinstarbuster> just kill Minh you automatically take his highest town when you take one from him
[2:04:41] <%emperordread> 47% is the new 91%
[2:04:47] <dastmwolf> speed is king
[2:04:48] <%Jetzord> How does he keep getting away with this
[2:04:49] <DiscoDur0> he had a 50 percents chance of winning, but Minh is a genetic freak and not normal
[2:04:53] <RockmanX47> The Uchiha cannot fall to parlor tricks!
[2:04:56] <+soFISHticated98> Reggie is screwing himself wasting his time on this

[2:05:06] <whitemage4life> Original was more dramatic. Brotherhood never had Lust cause a petrifying pandemic
[2:05:06] <Shishi1205> LUL
[2:05:16] <Hawkbone_> How is Reggie wasting his time? He can't do anything else
[2:05:18] <+soFISHticated98> @YourShadowDani first playthrough for all of them
[2:05:19] <%irfan_> reggie still has the nitro right?
[2:05:28] <%irfan_> so any random encounter could fuck him
[2:05:28] <andrei11dr> This is blind
[2:05:30] <$silentblast93> did the knives come out?
[2:05:31] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @irfan_ yeah
[2:05:35] <KNWatcher> I never got the ending for brotherhood
[2:05:38] <+jiggy_snipe> yea idk why he's going into combabt
[2:05:39] <dastmwolf> I can't wait for the inevitable Dokapon rematch. shits gonna be crazy now that people know the game
[2:05:44] <+YourShadowDani> Only way I got to the end was a truce with my stepdad so we could see what happens in the end
[2:05:49] <+BubbaRands> STONKS
[2:05:52] <starwolfgang> Strike damage is determined by the attacker's AT MG and SP against the defender's DF MG and SP
[2:05:53] <+prime_name> Did you?
[2:06:04] <%heartlesshealer> Minh's getting that tone
[2:06:06] <Daba_mk2> get minh
[2:06:09] <%Superbro64> @silentblast93 there's rumors that the mangaka is planning on that for the next arc
[2:06:10] <flyingtentaclemonster> Minh needs to catch up on lvl
[2:06:12] <+soFISHticated98> honestly he's not stalling
[2:06:13] <+InfiniteHav0k> These one off town takes dont do anything in the long run
[2:06:15] <%Superbro64> the signs are there
[2:06:15] <%viewtifulr> here we go again he's monolouging
[2:06:15] <DiscoDur0> what is this heel promo?
[2:06:16] <strayed42> Woolie stalls the game more than Minh ever has lol
[2:06:18] <+jiggy_snipe> he's playing the game
[2:06:19] <andrei11dr> @silentblast93 Not in this session, but earlier on iea kinda
[2:06:20] <%C4m3r0n0409> Minh is playing smart
[2:06:23] <Electro96> there's money and honor on the line
[2:06:24] <ainda_> Minh the genius Minh the champion
[2:06:25] <+soFISHticated98> it doesn't take anything away from the boss quest
[2:06:28] <Shishi1205> yooo

[2:06:39] <dastmwolf> loooool
[2:06:41] <%heartlesshealer> we get it, for the most part. It's just that item duplication is fucking scary
[2:06:41] <RockmanX47> The drug wars were stopped by Weber
[2:06:42] <+soFISHticated98> use the volt
[2:06:45] <+BubbaRands> Minh's staying safe

[2:06:50] <royb2> @thesickestzak the bar is not too high
[2:06:51] <+soFISHticated98> good job minh
[2:07:00] <DSD24> "That's not how the law equivalent exchange works"
[2:07:07] <andrei11dr> Minh is just doing the right things to the world DarkMode
[2:07:11] <deepaire> I love you Woolie! #TeamWoolie all the way
[2:07:14] <%Th3SmartAlec> Can 1HP the WEAKEST one LUL
[2:07:16] <%C4m3r0n0409> IT WAS ALREADY FREE
[2:07:20] <+InfiniteHav0k> It keeps him in 1st, but it is completely irrelevant at this point. Minh is better off trying to end the game quick before they use darkling enough times to screw him over.
[2:07:25] <thesickestzak> @royb2 with how Woolie and Reggie waste time going for each other, very true
[2:07:27] <%Th3SmartAlec> @C4m3r0n0409 It's freer now
[2:07:32] <%heroversusofficial> He didnt cast the other bolt ._.
[2:07:33] <whitemage4life> @deepaire Amen bruddah
[2:07:42] <%emperordread> Volt+ Danube just to remind them they are at perpetual war
[2:07:42] <%C4m3r0n0409> You are correct
[2:07:46] <Mr_Ease> he can't cast 2 since he's no longer a magician
[2:07:47] <%neraren> he ant double cast, hes not a mage
[2:07:50] <DiscoDur0> ooh, no magic defense tho
[2:07:51] <%heroversusofficial> Ah
[2:07:51] <gamewarden92> He STILL has no magic defense
[2:07:53] <%heroversusofficial> Thats true
[2:07:55] <%heartlesshealer> oh right, minh is now defenseless against battle magic
[2:07:57] <starwolfgang> I forgot he still has no defensive magic
[2:08:01] <+BubbaRands> pew
[2:08:07] <DSD24> Look at that POSE
[2:08:10] <%viewtifulr> watch him get another angel chocker
[2:08:15] <+YourShadowDani> yeah going head 2 head with my stepdad we could not get anywhere, it probably helps to have more players so one can progress while others at throats
[2:08:20] <starwolfgang> If he gets into a fight with Woolie he'd probably be screwed
[2:08:22] <dapperskeleton69> yo they found asian murder hornets in north america
[2:08:23] <%yeetdabsenpai69> Woolie you can kill minh with magic
[2:08:25] <Electro96> woolie would destroy minh if they came into contact
[2:08:28] <+jiggy_snipe> Reggie might as well take those towns
[2:08:34] <+soFISHticated98> Minh would take it
[2:08:36] <dapperskeleton69> 2020 got even worse
[2:08:36] <+soFISHticated98> strike!
[2:08:42] <dastmwolf> I don't want Minh to win and I get salty whe he screws the other two so hard and slows the game to a crawl. but it's undeniable he's by far the best player and deserves to win
[2:08:45] <Shishi1205> time out
[2:08:56] <obislamjamobi> I was gone for like 10 mins, what happened?
[2:09:00] <%Th3SmartAlec> @yeetdabsenpai69 I think he knows. How would he get to Minh at the moment without wasting a ton of time?
[2:09:00] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @dastmwolf yeeaaa :(
[2:09:03] <Shishi1205> almost 50%
[2:09:04] <DiscoDur0> time out LUL
[2:09:06] <%emperordread> 47% = 100%

[2:10:35] <DiscoDur0> Overlord Rico in the Tower of Rabble
[2:10:36] <+soFISHticated98> he's in the tower @aka_Jigawatt
[2:10:37] <+Taglog7> it's the true antagonist
[2:10:38] <NeroInfinite> The Tower apparentl
[2:10:43] <%Th3SmartAlec> No point in conjure
[2:10:48] <Mr_Ease> no point
[2:10:50] <mdkcde> Stock up on magic woolie
[2:10:51] <%perfectsalami> Goddamn it im so far behind
[2:10:58] <%C4m3r0n0409> INVEST
[2:11:01] <McGwinnicus> Lawley
[2:11:03] <Shishi1205> STONKS
[2:11:03] <%emperordread> Go to the mountain Reggie
[2:11:15] <+Taglog7> gotta catch up on the anime
[2:11:28] <andrei11dr> Also you need to get there first LUL
[2:11:30] <%viewtifulr> read the manga translation
[2:11:31] <+InfiniteHav0k> Reggies best bet is doing the flower side quest
[2:11:33] <Hawkbone_> All it takes is one mistake and Reggie would murder Woolie
[2:11:37] <starwolfgang> All that Woolie knows is the battlefield
[2:11:43] <Camail> the richest for sure
[2:11:43] <+jiggy_snipe> they forgot about that quest
[2:11:52] <%C4m3r0n0409> FREE
[2:11:53] <%aka_Jigawatt> where is the tower
[2:12:04] <%Amaideus> Where Reggie's at
[2:12:06] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[2:12:07] <Camail> once they go in, i assume they're committing
[2:12:10] <%Amaideus> Woolie*
[2:12:13] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @hawkbone_ If reggie didnt kept rusting sure
[2:12:13] <+jiggy_snipe> the tower is in australia close to Woolie
[2:12:15] <+Mekhet09> If only he had more mg. Then it'd do mor edamage.
[2:12:18] <Camail> its to the northeast of the continent they're on i think
[2:12:21] <%Amaideus> But Woolie is raising his stonks
[2:12:34] <%perfectsalami> What exacly has led minh to fully embrace being a villain
[2:12:42] <Hawkbone_> @yeetdabsenpai69 If Reggie kept rusting I imagine it might actually get Woolie, at least on the first or second try.
[2:12:43] <DerpioParty> Could have seen that counter
[2:12:44] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[2:12:45] <gamewarden92> @perfectsalami The Haters
[2:12:47] <+soFISHticated98> people wouldn't stop hating him
[2:12:50] <%C4m3r0n0409> People didn't like him so he went bad
[2:12:52] <Camail> perfectsalami youtube comments
[2:12:54] <DSD24> How do you strike with a crossbow?
[2:12:56] <+soFISHticated98> but it's also a bit
[2:13:00] <+soFISHticated98> he's playing it up
[2:13:06] <%irfan_> minh getting magic from alchemist level up is gonna help a lot
[2:13:08] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @hawkbone_ I mean it hasnt yet so meh
[2:13:09] <+jiggy_snipe> he's also playing the exact same way
[2:13:10] <DiscoDur0> I think he's good on speed LUL
[2:13:11] <%Jetzord> @perfectsalami the same thing as all heels, the fans
[2:13:12] <+soFISHticated98> he's actually just playing the same
[2:13:21] <alexandrecau> Minh you'll forget your plan in the next five minutes
[2:13:23] <Mr_Ease> Minh realized that the people weren't cheering for him, so he said, "screw it, if you think I'm a villain, than I'm going to act like a villain"
[2:13:25] <%perfectsalami> ah, hes leaning in to the heel role
[2:13:25] <Hawkbone_> @yeetdabsenpai69 They've only fought once since Reggie got rust.
[2:13:27] <+mrcooperblack> Minh has 17 DF?!
[2:13:30] <SheefEatsBeef> STEEAAALLLL
[2:13:36] <+NWannabe> he was striking with impunity last game
[2:13:38] <+mrcooperblack> that fool's ankles are weak!
[2:13:39] <+soFISHticated98> no? since when
[2:13:40] <+NWannabe> session*
[2:13:45] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @hawkbone_ I'm sure they fought more...
[2:13:46] <+Mekhet09> Store ward
[2:13:48] <%Amaideus> He was also in a low level area last session
[2:13:49] <ManfredA> from what I rear base DF is outright inferior to HP
[2:13:51] <+mrcooperblack> JUKE that man and take his shoes!
[2:13:52] <%Solidnick18> hmmm
[2:13:53] <+Mekhet09> STORE WARP
[2:13:54] <+paladinstarbuster> a just die Reggie literally
[2:13:54] <Shishi1205> 4 spinner away
[2:13:55] <Hawkbone_> @yeetdabsenpai69 They havn't.
[2:14:04] <NyxFang> store warp
[2:14:04] <%yeetdabsenpai69> ah my b
[2:14:05] <+soFISHticated98> yeah HP is a superior stat
[2:14:09] <%Solidnick18> warp
[2:14:10] <%fetrigon> store warp?
[2:14:14] <+soFISHticated98> you can get most of your DF from shields and be fine
[2:14:16] <+jiggy_snipe> @yeetdabsenpai69 Reggie could kill Woolie because Reggie's highest stat is attack but Woolie's is hp and def
[2:14:16] <%Th3SmartAlec> Warp, yeah
[2:14:19] <%Amaideus> Back to SA you go!
[2:14:21] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> Warp
[2:14:21] <+NWannabe> How do you kno I am on old manga head? Everytime I see DF I think Devil Fruit
[2:14:25] <%irfan_> inb4 he gets stuck in africa again
[2:14:29] <+Gespens> each point of defense is 1.2 effective HP
[2:14:32] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> I mean...why not?
[2:14:36] <Mr_Ease> honestly he should just take all the towns
[2:14:46] <+soFISHticated98> Woolie's stats are all smoothed out except for HP
[2:14:57] <+soFISHticated98> it's not as effective because it's a jack of all trades build
[2:15:00] <whitemage4life> Remember not to use Machina during Quarantine. praise Yevon
[2:15:00] <+soFISHticated98> he's master of none
[2:15:00] <%fetrigon> actually he could take all those towns
[2:15:01] <%Solidnick18> yeah
[2:15:01] <Shishi1205> WOOLIE is a big hp tank
[2:15:08] <+lucaflowe> He could take the towns but he's slacking for some reason
[2:15:12] <andrei11dr> Just wrap
[2:15:19] <Shishi1205> with his new magic he has an advantage tho
[2:15:20] <+jiggy_snipe> sbfpBleetz sbfpBleetz
[2:15:20] <Hawkbone_> Right now in terms of net value there's nothing for Reggie in australia, so might as well go to Greenland
[2:15:21] <+NWannabe> @whitemage4life how you talking t us w/o machina?
[2:15:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> Reggie is pulling a Woolie right now
[2:15:37] <Decimated_body> ResidentSleeper

[2:16:44] <+jiggy_snipe> what's atrophy do?
[2:16:46] <+Cardz_> psaWhat
[2:16:46] <%heartlesshealer> why not another Time Out for chasing Minh if he escapes?
[2:16:48] <R3Roundabout> I wish this game had turn timers like Civilization. There would be so much less downtime and turns would take minutes instead of hours.
[2:16:56] <Shishi1205> Reggie has to delay Minh to the max
[2:16:57] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1255023082869272576
[2:16:58] <+NWannabe> @whitemage4life that's odd, you can smell what my typing sounds like? You sure you ain't under the toxin's influence?
[2:17:00] <whitemage4life> @jiggy_snipe wakka wakka
[2:17:03] <%Jetzord> @jiggy_snipe lowers attack I think, it lowers a stat
[2:17:10] <%Th3SmartAlec> NICE
[2:17:12] <%Double_Tap_That> !uptime
[2:17:13] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 17 minutes
[2:17:16] <+soFISHticated98> that wouldn't be fun for actual play
[2:17:16] <KRaZyAmmo> invest
[2:17:20] <Shishi1205> Stonk up?
[2:17:21] <+soFISHticated98> timers
[2:17:22] <+Mekhet09> Woolie you want to go into that tower.
[2:17:28] <+Mekhet09> It has really good shit.

[2:17:54] <RenegadeEpsilon> rico sr booling
[2:17:58] <+soFISHticated98> no reason to go into tower if nobody else is trying
[2:17:59] <%Th3SmartAlec> Goodbye Bug, you were the best of us
[2:18:00] <PleasantLeech> this game already creates enough anxiety it doesn't need time limits
[2:18:02] <+Gespens> FIGHT
[2:18:03] <+soFISHticated98> might as well fortify his position
[2:18:05] <%C4m3r0n0409> FIGHT
[2:18:06] <%Superdandy96> If the boys were to introduce a timed limit of how long they can think, how much would that change the game?
[2:18:07] <andrei11dr> Reggie, i know you want to take revenge on Minh, But it would be so good to use the Squal on Woolie!
[2:18:12] <%yeetdabsenpai69> LOOP
[2:18:14] <+jiggy_snipe> Reggie can invest in Africa I guess
[2:18:16] <%Solidnick18> town if not to fight tho
[2:18:19] <Shishi1205> a town
[2:18:22] <DerpioParty> If Reggie dies he goes back to Oz, right?
[2:18:22] <mdkcde> Fight! Fight Figth! Fight!
[2:18:26] <+soFISHticated98> Africa - Makuta you mean
[2:18:32] <%kingkeldeo31> Reggie could stop by his castle
[2:18:35] <%nintega010> Run you're hands

[2:18:44] <Mr_Ease> I've got nothing to lose, he says to the man with rust
[2:18:46] <%Amaideus> Imagine if reggie forces it on minh
[2:18:50] <DSD24> Eternally retold...
[2:18:51] <%Amaideus> And then Alchemist clones it
[2:18:52] <%Struggleful> We're throwing FADES
[2:18:53] <%Amaideus> Over and over
[2:18:59] <%Th3SmartAlec> The item space of course Kappa
[2:19:06] <+jordy_j_s> Reggie lose to Minh so you respawn on the new contintent!
[2:19:06] <%heroversusofficial> A TALE OF SWORDS AND SOULS, ETERNALLY RETOLD
[2:19:08] <%b_aleph> A weapon loss will absolutely cripple Minh at this point
[2:19:13] <%Spydurman> Mihn pointing to the stands
[2:19:16] <illtima> A TALE OF SOUR AND SALT
[2:19:19] <whitemage4life> @nwannabe I knew a guy that happened to though. Turns out he was just a dream
[2:19:22] <%Th3SmartAlec> PogChamp
[2:19:24] <%Solidnick18> the one time
[2:19:27] <%emperordread> Minh goes off to some barren DBZ wasteland like "Fite me coward"
[2:19:29] <%viewtifulr> Alcamizing...nitro if only
[2:19:30] <%perfectsalami> a riiivveeeer in a drrry land
[2:19:34] <%C4m3r0n0409> FIGHT
[2:19:34] <+jiggy_snipe> idk Reggie loses a weapon and being transported to Australia would cripple him
[2:19:35] <%legacy0117> Reggie, my recommendation to you. Pick Spellsword. It has a cool ability.
[2:19:36] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> Rust his ass! I hope he doesn’t forget Minh has no magic defense
[2:19:36] <PleasantLeech> Minh is making a mistake challenging a boy with rust
[2:19:37] <%kyh9> THE MIHISTER
[2:19:37] <%perfectsalami> the last ace in a lost hand
[2:19:37] <%Th3SmartAlec> The game is colluding with Minh on those counters
[2:19:38] <%C4m3r0n0409> TENDERIZE
[2:19:41] <strayed42> "You are not worthy as my opponent"
[2:19:42] <dastmwolf> there are so many towns left to claim. Reggie needs to go for them. not fight minh
[2:19:42] <+jiggy_snipe> DONT FIGHT

[2:39:09] <R3Roundabout> You can tell they just finished Naruto because they need a monologue and a flashback between every fight scene
[2:39:10] <%strugglepunk2> thanks
[2:39:15] <Camail> this is frustrating now....
[2:39:19] <%Fujiwara_92> STOP RUSHING HIM CHAT, Y'ALL WANT THIS TO END FASTER?

[2:39:27] <%strugglepunk2> I'm wondering
[2:39:29] <Sheepwalk> Go Tower balls out
[2:39:30] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Fujiwara_92 You make a strong point
[2:39:33] <+trippersigs22> Woolie has the longest turns and accomplishes the least
[2:39:35] <+soFISHticated98> I want it to be watchable
[2:39:36] <Ghost__Pantsu> If you really want to win just play while the others are gone :)

[2:39:46] <+Mekhet09> It's not.
[2:39:46] <%legacy0117> Some folks are tired of the salt. Tis understandable.
[2:39:47] <+soFISHticated98> no wrong move
[2:39:48] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie with his 1/6 gambles LUL
[2:39:48] <%optimasmaximas> @Mekhet09 well, it has, but naruto was the only one LUL
[2:39:49] <+Mekhet09> Your speed is bad.
[2:39:49] <+gutlesscoward> or you can farm fights to master magician, then go alchemist
[2:39:50] <%C4m3r0n0409> WOOLIE NO
[2:39:52] <PleasantLeech> guys monologues are inevitable with the blood pool on the table
[2:39:53] <+soFISHticated98> bad
[2:39:54] <Camail> 8 in two spins is fairly likely
[2:39:54] <%Dapper_Cactuar> did the contract get used yet?
[2:39:55] <+soFISHticated98> oh no
[2:39:59] <%emperordread> @Kriss1827 the thing is he isn't playing
[2:40:01] <%Typhaeon> It all returns to nothing
[2:40:03] <LongLiveTheBulletClub> wtf
[2:40:08] <+soFISHticated98> yes
[2:40:09] <%strugglepunk2> what sort of economic relief is better then causing some friends to stab each other?
[2:40:10] <resloxxx> YES
[2:40:10] <+paladinstarbuster> Banish is good
[2:40:10] <%Typhaeon> He just keeps tumbling down, tumbling down, tumbling down
[2:40:11] <dastmwolf> ResidentSleeper
[2:40:15] <Shishi1205> nice
[2:40:15] <+jiggy_snipe> guys get used to Woolie being like this, this is who is and complaining wont do anything about it
[2:40:19] <%C4m3r0n0409> ATTACK
[2:40:20] <%Fujiwara_92> Man its really cozy here in the back WITH ALL THIS BACKSITTING I SEE SoonerLater
[2:40:21] <%strugglepunk2> that's a tempting drop
[2:40:22] <%Kriss1827> @emperordread planing out a turn is playing the game
[2:40:26] <hectic_harlequin> Super dead
[2:40:27] <SethKyu> strike :p
[2:40:28] <+gutlesscoward> zippity zap him
[2:40:28] <%Solidnick18> He does counter
[2:40:31] <Hawkbone_> Y'all realize that turns probably wouldn't be taking this long if you didn't contribute to the blood pool, right? Its your own fault.
[2:40:35] <Shishi1205> Strike easy
[2:40:37] <Brandon__Brando> chat chill enjoy the game
[2:40:40] <%Solidnick18> Yeah
[2:40:41] <%perfectsalami> ifrit has seen better days
[2:40:45] <%C4m3r0n0409> 47 LUL

[2:40:50] <+gutlesscoward> 47
[2:40:50] <PleasantLeech> dooo!
[2:40:58] <Shishi1205> Yo Mag Dx is OD
[2:40:59] <%perfectsalami> this ifrit skipped leg day
[2:41:05] <%Fujiwara_92> yeah, if the stakes weren't this high turns would go instantly, there's that
[2:41:05] <+soFISHticated98> Uvs Nuur might be level 6
[2:41:12] <Camail> visit poor old danube
[2:41:12] <+trippersigs22> 10min turn just to fight a rando
[2:41:14] <+Mekhet09> They're investing one chapter earlier than they should.
[2:41:15] <+jiggy_snipe> man the battles of Africa were crazy, so many twists and turns
[2:41:16] <Camail> they need some morale
[2:41:17] <R3Roundabout> @Fujiwara_92 Noone is trying to push advice on them. We all just want them to move as if they were trying to entertain an audience
[2:41:24] <NeroInfinite> can't miss leg day if you don't have legs
[2:41:29] <%perfectsalami> how much we got in the pools now by the way?
[2:41:39] <%C4m3r0n0409> THIS IS FOR MONEY
[2:41:40] <+Mekhet09> Woolie can finish the chapter then contract and reset the clock.
[2:41:42] <%legacy0117> I put in just $10. Others have thrown in hundreds or fifty dollars at a time. It'd been okay if it stayed around 700.
[2:41:43] <%C4m3r0n0409> THINK ALL YOU WANT
[2:41:44] <Shishi1205> Damn that sneak hit was a super gamble that paid off
[2:41:50] <SethKyu> 3370 for the blood pool, i think
[2:41:51] <%Solidnick18> oh leane
[2:41:51] <%Pinkiefan> How can we check the pool totals?
[2:41:55] <+jiggy_snipe> ugh Leane gtfo
[2:41:56] <%neraren> If you wanted them to play for entertainment you shouldnt have made the stakes 3300 dollars
[2:41:58] <andrei11dr> Just sell it
[2:42:00] <%neraren> They are playing to WIN
[2:42:00] <%McSoliace> @R3Roundabout with 3 grand on the line thats kinda unfair
[2:42:03] <hectic_harlequin> Food
[2:42:04] <%Fujiwara_92> @r3roundabout nah, I get what most ppl here are trying to do... but then again part of the chat is just NotLikeThis
[2:42:05] <%Solidnick18> fried scorpion
[2:42:09] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Has Minh ever delivered one of these?
[2:42:11] <thesickestzak> Just eat it
[2:42:12] <+Gespens> It scales with week, I believe
[2:42:14] <%gatorafan> They've never done any of her events
[2:42:22] <%Amaideus> They did once
[2:42:27] <%Amaideus> It took forever
[2:42:30] <%Superdandy96> Leane just an honest girl trying to help her friends. “UGH, it’s her.”

[2:42:47] <%C4m3r0n0409> Okay Minh fuck over Reggie
[2:42:47] <PleasantLeech> STONKS
[2:42:48] <R3Roundabout> @Fujiwara_92 You are absolutely right about the blood pool slowing them. The greatest draw of this series has become its greatest curse
[2:42:50] <andrei11dr> I think the blackmail will kill him next turns
[2:42:51] <Brandon__Brando> #TeamFoot
[2:42:53] <hectic_harlequin> He's so gonna die and unleash that blackmail
[2:42:57] <%Amaideus> Only if you're impatient
[2:42:58] <Hawkbone_> Its a very unstable first place, though
[2:42:59] <%xcompleasedad> This is the fucking greatest.
[2:43:06] <%xcompleasedad> GOD WANTS HIM TO WIN
[2:43:06] <%Amaideus> I'm greatly enjoying their turmoil
[2:43:08] <%Fujiwara_92> yeah, remember that as much as they like to play it out, when money go up entertainment go down, cause big money ppl
[2:43:10] <%C4m3r0n0409> Where's the guided warp at
[2:43:12] <%gatorafan> @amaideus and what does. it reward? Because I've legit haven't seen it and I've been on all the streams
[2:43:14] <%Superdandy96> I can’t believe Woolz still has that on the ready.
[2:43:17] <Xeno351> the worst thing is woolie played it all correct it just didn't end up being right LUL
[2:43:20] <%emperordread> Pay blackmail -> spin
[2:43:21] <themightyseptopus> woolieDATTEBAYO_BW
[2:43:27] <Mr_Ease> wait can rico sr take over towns like other boss monsters?
[2:43:29] <%Amaideus> @gatorafan It's a bunch of money, depends on how fast you get it there
[2:43:31] <dastmwolf> he needs to get rid of the blackmail, what are you doing reggie
[2:43:34] <%C4m3r0n0409> Reggie move

[2:43:49] <Someguy893> He wants to die from the blackmail
[2:43:49] <%Amaideus> Ikr
[2:43:50] <%gatorafan> @amaideus yeah, I guess that's kinda nothing at this point
[2:43:52] <ainda_> what else is lping even for
[2:43:55] <%Amaideus> Chat needs more sadism
[2:44:00] <DSD24> Yo man this monster eats hot fire
[2:44:03] <Mr_Ease> I love hearing the thought process honestly
[2:44:04] <mdkcde> OOF
[2:44:05] <Hawkbone_> No, you want to die to the blackmail, then you'll end up in australia
[2:44:09] <Daba_mk2> chill chat
[2:44:09] <Camail> might not be magic damage
[2:44:10] <%Amaideus> Money is important, it's just we dunno how much it'll be
[2:44:16] <+blademaster247> It's field magic that procs it
[2:44:17] <%C4m3r0n0409> Woolie has psychokinesis i think
[2:44:17] <Camail> he's only been hit by magic this entire time
[2:44:19] <%Amaideus> It could be quite a lot
[2:44:21] <hectic_harlequin> That Nitro's gonna fuck him over at the worst possible time
[2:44:21] <mdkcde> Compare the damages and woolie has so much magic defense
[2:44:22] <+jiggy_snipe> i guess he needs to get rid of both
[2:44:23] <andrei11dr> It's packaged really good
[2:44:27] <%emperordread> It's been zapped, burned and pummeled but it won't go off
[2:44:29] <%Fujiwara_92> chill chat, this what y'all paid for, ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED? LUL
[2:44:36] <Hawkbone_> @C4m3r0n0409 Woolie lost his psychokinesis a while ago

[3:09:37] <+Ignotum42> That's the part I hate most about Reggie's behavior. He makes snippy comments and doesnt have the balls to back them up.
[3:09:40] <haisho> that blood pool showing its influence eh?
[3:09:40] <%yeetdabsenpai69> definitly temple
[3:09:41] <%Fujiwara_92> Both the world and Reggie just stopped Woolie, and that's was fucking dirty

[3:09:52] <%Kriss1827> @Fujiwara_92 i agree
[3:09:53] <%SuperKirby24> I feel inclined to support woolie out of empathy
[3:09:54] <Camail> all the towns are basically owned, so investing is gonna be relevant
[3:09:57] <thesickestzak> Minh big brain Woolie and Reggie smol
[3:10:04] <Shishi1205> Reggie has actually screw it. Now Minh has free reign to invest
[3:10:07] <crimsonsaens> Grab the piranha then go to temple
[3:10:09] <+trippersigs22> Woolie take 3 year long turns and is still comfortably in last place
[3:10:18] <%fetrigon> I no longer support anyone now though. Just going to remain a bystander.
[3:10:26] <Shishi1205> Reggie has to foot sore minh
[3:10:26] <Hawkbone_> @Ignotum42 "I wasn't intending to talk shit" "SEE?! HE'S TALKING SHIT! HE'S BAD!"
[3:10:33] <+Ignotum42> I support Woolie, and to a degree Minh cause they play the game like it's a game, and not a chance to cheap shot each other.
[3:10:36] <hectic_harlequin> It's fine
[3:10:38] <%ChoculaUltra> the bags under the orinoco chief's eyes are big vibes
[3:10:39] <Huntercd> How is the bloodshed?
[3:10:40] <+jiggy_snipe> Woolie's only in last place because he attempted to fight Reggie who has the best mixups with Rust, Strike and Sneak Hit
[3:10:41] <ainda_> dont apologize let them suffer
[3:10:41] <%C4m3r0n0409> WOOLIE DONT APOLOGIZE
[3:10:44] <PleasantLeech> it's okay woolie

[3:10:50] <starwolfgang> There's a lot of variables in this game
[3:10:52] <%legacy0117> Dokapon Kingdom stomps on everyone. That's everyday, every week, and Danube is the very center of it.
[3:10:52] <Shishi1205> it's ok
[3:10:53] <Daba_mk2> woolz turns are literally fine
[3:10:57] <%Solidnick18> it's alright

[3:10:57] <Junkles> SeemsGood
[3:10:58] <PleasantLeech> honestly everyone takes long turns
[3:11:01] <arkv01> this LP was a lot more fun to watch before the bloodpool turned this into mortal combat
[3:11:01] <+soFISHticated98> to be fair Woolie schooled that mixup last time
[3:11:02] <%Solidnick18> their is money

[3:11:04] <%C4m3r0n0409> IM DEPRESSED FOR WOOLIE
[3:11:04] <%perfectsalami> this is a natural outcome of the stakes being this high
[3:11:05] <R3Roundabout> Tension is rising, the jovial laughs have been replaced with dread and anticipation
[3:11:05] <andrei11dr> Then you should apologize for that Bloodborne LP too
[3:11:07] <%Superdandy96> Meh, it’s fine.
[3:11:17] <Brandon__Brando> its k I dont get what chat is yelling about
[3:11:19] <%perfectsalami> this lust for victory is what we asked for
[3:11:21] <%Fujiwara_92> I'm still rooting for Woolie, cause he was my choice from the get go, but I'm fine with Minh winning cause he's the heel and ya gotta love the heel... nothing against Reggie tho
[3:11:26] <dastmwolf> woolie decided to fight Reggie. he created his own downfall
[3:11:26] <%feiashtear> in the anime we can turn the speed up
[3:11:28] <%Th3SmartAlec> Oh, the long turns are fine from a LP point of view
[3:11:31] <hectic_harlequin> Such a lust for revenge!
[3:11:33] <%Kriss1827> @Fujiwara_92 Team Woolie forever tho
[3:11:35] <%Th3SmartAlec> It's poisoned
[3:11:36] <%Fujiwara_92> and yeah, take your time imo Woolie, fuck chat
[3:11:38] <Junkles> minh the hero

[3:22:27] <%legacy0117> Or very rsrely.
[3:22:28] <DerpioParty> Feet then squall
[3:22:32] <%legacy0117> rarely*
[3:22:33] <Shishi1205> Give him feet
[3:22:33] <%gatorafan> Reggie sent Woolie from Australia all the way back to Canada
[3:22:39] <+jiggy_snipe> finally Woolie is playing like Minh too
[3:22:40] <Hawkbone_> @Ignotum42 I really wasn't that straightforward at all.
[3:22:43] <+GenesisKnight> LUL
[3:22:43] <DerpioParty> Stall the feet
[3:22:46] <Electro96> dropping reggie's town warp would ruin him
[3:22:47] <Sheepwalk> Give Reggie feet

[3:24:31] <%Amaideus> @Gespens Thanks
[3:24:33] <%Superdandy96> I don’t think Colosseum has activated once during this play session
[3:24:35] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @ignotum42 yep
[3:24:41] <%Th3SmartAlec> @jiggy_snipe Oh yeah, I want each of them to play their best (and... better than their best in some cases)
[3:24:41] <The_err0r> CAVE MIHN NEW CONTINENT
[3:24:49] <%legacy0117> The developers of the game had to do the testing themselves, and they were told to make this game as "Unfair" as possible.
[3:24:49] <+Gespens> iirc, Colosseum has the lowest proc rate of all of the start of week events
[3:24:51] <%Amaideus> It hasn't, I thought it'd show up as a later chapter unlock
[3:25:05] <%Th3SmartAlec> Level 2 PogChamp
[3:25:28] <+Ignotum42> Probably cause the "Come Here" effect of it can be pretty killer depending where you are

[3:35:10] <%Th3SmartAlec> @SuperKirby24 Compared to everyone else not really. He's got a M Guard Upgrade that makes Magic weak against him in battle

[4:06:53] <%jiggy_snipe> man field magic has altered this game so much LUL
[4:06:59] <Shishi1205> 5 am baby time for your squals
[4:06:59] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[4:07:01] <%Hawkbone_> Squall is probably the single most infuriating spell in the whole game
[4:07:04] <%Fujiwara_92> yeah, I'm don't think we'll see a lot more Darklings until the end
[4:07:11] <%perfectsalami> Haha yeah. *stay in third where you belong*

[4:07:16] <DerpioParty> Rob that cat
[4:07:16] <haisho> I can't believe Minh is ready to survive....
[4:07:22] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Fujiwara_92 And the Darkling will decide who loses LUL
[4:07:23] <%Amaideus> It feels like one of them should just go Spellblade at this point
[4:07:28] <+Grayhammatter> minh getting ready for reggie
[4:07:29] <Electro96> squall is way too cheap and easy to get
[4:07:31] <GDandy> I wonder how different this playthrough would be if Squall wasn't a store item
[4:07:33] <%Amaideus> I wonder if that's what they're building towards
[4:07:33] <%legacy0117> Field magic is literally what extends this game way farther ty than normal.
[4:07:38] <%Fujiwara_92> @th3smartalec pretty much LUL

[4:29:51] <realapothe> huge payoff because of all the damage woolie did on that space with his spells
[4:29:51] <%nintega010> SpellSword is actually good
[4:29:52] <Dalkalopagus> It paints a target on your back
[4:29:53] <%Th3SmartAlec> Need to heal at all?

[5:00:10] <PleasantLeech> hey just because it's filler doesn't mean it's not entertaining
[5:00:14] <thesickestzak> Minh very BIG BRAIN
[5:00:15] <%nintega010> it's been alot of emotional ups and downs. Also the longer it takes the closer woolie gets to roboknight.

[5:00:58] <%DashXero> Diarbetes
[5:01:02] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @sethkyu he can do it I believe
[5:01:02] <%Kriss1827> @Fujiwara_92 this will be a quote one day "So weve been playing Dokapon for a year now and the bloodpool is at 10k"
[5:01:07] <%Superdandy96> Test of the hero, who can’t be seen crapping their pants?!
[5:01:12] <%jiggy_snipe> hmmm
[5:01:17] <+Grayhammatter> buy vanishes and spinners
[5:01:17] <%fetrigon> This is fun to watch tho!
[5:01:19] <%Th3SmartAlec> Lock Minh's ass
[5:01:27] <%jiggy_snipe> if he died to the plague, he would drop his cash right?
[5:01:33] <%paladinstarbuster> Reggie change to spellsword and stop this madness
[5:01:38] <Mr_Ease> and now all of Calumet is plagued
[5:01:41] <%legacy0117> Lock is more expensive than ourse cutters.
[5:01:41] <thesickestzak> I'm surprised they're still going tonight, but I love it.
[5:01:43] <%JetpackMcQuack> Quietest session yet

[5:02:12] <thesickestzak> woolieGASM_BW
[5:02:12] <%nintega010> Spellsword would be good for Reggie just to make Minh think before using it on him.
[5:02:18] <%jiggy_snipe> Woolie was defeated after he lost Yarra with all the work he put in
[5:02:19] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie somehow still asking if Minh is the bigger threat
[5:02:20] <%emperordread> I propose we refer to all magic as "Fuck you magic"
[5:02:20] <%legacy0117> And Minh's Speed is at Speedrunner Mario's level at this point.
[5:02:21] <DSD24> Woolie is OFF THE GRID
[5:02:23] <DedlokPM> Daze is something Jotaro says after Yare Yare
[5:02:33] <%Th3SmartAlec> Spinners for sure

[5:03:16] <%Amaideus> Honestly Reggie with the Spellsword class is basically a constant vortex of 50-50s
[5:03:25] <+CJett92> Woolies be shoppiiiiiiiiing
[5:03:31] <%Fujiwara_92> LUL
[5:03:32] <%jiggy_snipe> Spellsword sounds interesting
[5:03:35] <+Ether101_Prime> What is the goal of this game?
[5:03:35] <%Amaideus> Rust-Strike-Poke, 50% bounceback on the field
[5:03:38] <Klefth> @emperordread Or "fuck the stream" magic
[5:03:43] <%Amaideus> Kill the last boss @Ether101_Prime
[5:03:44] <%legacy0117> Vanish is also a major help against field magic spammers, but they are usually limited in stock.
[5:03:44] <+soFISHticated98> spellsword seems good only in this meta
[5:03:47] <%emperordread> Trips, check em

[5:04:14] <%Fujiwara_92> LUL MINH THE MASTERMIND

[5:05:00] <%heroversusofficial> We're reached the filler arc
[5:05:01] <%legacy0117> Nah, Minh knows how dirty squall spam is.
[5:05:02] <Camail> gotta chain vanish, apparently
[5:05:02] <%kekkerscrew> SPELLSWORD PLS
[5:05:02] <%heartlesshealer> jesus fuck
[5:05:03] <gamewarden92> Has Minh just become the god of death?
[5:05:07] <%EvanTheNewbie> Crabs in a bucket for sure
[5:05:08] <%viewtifulr> woolieDATTEBAYO_BW woolieREGGIEFUL_BW Reggie and Woolie getting deathcalled 10 times in a row
[5:05:11] <%Kriss1827> This was a Ladder match all along
[5:05:11] <Zbyrd0961> today i learned that reggie is the true evil
[5:05:11] <crimsonsaens> Ladder matches are much less hype when all of the wrestlers have Snatch
[5:05:11] <+FirelordGoroh> The sabotage is real
[5:05:11] <Klefth> Just get spellsword and stop his bullshit
[5:05:12] <iswearimjustdandy> De ja vu
[5:05:13] <Onmi_Khaos> No just the god of ass
[5:05:16] <%BisoromiBear> The true Dokapon playthrough starts now
[5:05:16] <%perfectsalami> crabs in a bucket motherfucker
[5:05:23] <SethKyu> The fact that there's 2 mages this late the game is sooooo. damn
[5:05:27] <%paladinstarbuster> shop
[5:05:28] <%Amaideus> I mean, getting to the castle is a problem too
[5:05:29] <%Th3SmartAlec> Your only hope is Reggie getting some Locks and colluding against Minh
[5:05:30] <DerpioParty> Woolie needs to go Darkling mode, and just walk his way to the tower to get in there
[5:05:30] <%viewtifulr> and they keep gettting squalled away from minh
[5:05:31] <+CJett92> @iswearimjustdandy I've just been in this place before
[5:05:37] <%dastmwolf> just declare a tie at this point xd
[5:05:48] <%Fujiwara_92> it's a ladder match where the bag above the ladder keeps getting heavier and heavier
[5:05:48] <%Amaideus> Reggie you need way more vanishes than that
[5:05:50] <DiscoDur0> he didnt church to rid the lock?
[5:05:50] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1255023082869272576
[5:05:52] <PleasantLeech> it's starting to feel like a desperate fight from all corners
[5:05:52] <Dalkalopagus> We need to denuclearize the game
[5:05:52] <%Kriss1827> @DerpioParty and lose all his towns? dont think its worth it
[5:05:56] <%legacy0117> REGGIE PLEASE GET SPELLSWORD....
[5:05:58] <$StaceMcGate> last 3 1/2 hours have just been buying spinners and field spells
[5:06:07] <DedlokPM> @dastmwolf blood pool demands a winner doodNuts
[5:06:09] <DerpioParty> No point to towns in the game never ends
[5:06:12] <%Amaideus> Also stonks going up
[5:06:13] <%aka_Jigawatt> !uptime
[5:06:13] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 5 hours and 6 minutes
[5:06:23] <%C24U> Just stock up on Vanish all the time
[5:06:28] <%Th3SmartAlec> @StaceMcGate The only breaks have been Minh intentionally starting fights
[5:06:33] <%Fujiwara_92> yeah, no one's becoming Darkling anytime soon folks, so buckle up
[5:06:36] <Onmi_Khaos> Like winning from this position doesn't happen, you need to, essentially, kill Minh, rob him, toss all his items and refuse to let him do anything. Or ban the use of Squall's... well okay, the other thing to do is get into the dungeon
[5:06:39] <+zegoodknight> i dont get the logic of keeping the 5 crystal over a spinner
[5:06:42] <%Hawkbone_> The game has been grinded to a fucking halt. Squall is all anyone knows anymore.
[5:06:42] <%legacy0117> Oh wait, FRICK he won't spawn at Dokapon Castle if he dies.
[5:06:55] <PleasantLeech> @derpioparty the more blood that is spilled the greater the size of the blood pool
[5:06:56] <%Th3SmartAlec> Cave please
[5:06:57] <%Hawkbone_> Squall is our god now
[5:06:58] <DSD24> I wonder if you get anything by not being a dick in this game
[5:07:03] <+Grayhammatter> oh god
[5:07:04] <%Fujiwara_92> @zegoodknight sometimes you need a 5 specifically
[5:07:04] <+soFISHticated98> CAAAAAVE
[5:07:05] <%GrassCannon> you don't
[5:07:06] <DSD24> Like Good Samaritan points or something
[5:07:07] <$StaceMcGate> I get the spirit of the game, but Squall really needs to be stopped
[5:07:07] <Onmi_Khaos> FFVIII rules this stream
[5:07:09] <+Grayhammatter> cave
[5:07:10] <Decimated_body> Minh is the SQUALL GOD
[5:07:14] <%jiggy_snipe> pray to the triple triad

[5:08:06] <+zegoodknight> @Fujiwara_92 I get that, but over having the option of moving 1-18 spaces? I dont think its worth

[5:10:06] <%Hawkbone_> @Onmi_Khaos Calm the fuck down, Z Plague is basically a minor inconvenience with how little damage it does.

[5:10:11] <%heartlesshealer> I see Reggie still has Yarra
[5:10:17] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> Oh....oh no.
[5:10:26] <+Mekhet09> Woolie could have had a castle if he wasn't so dumb.
[5:10:29] <%Th3SmartAlec> @ShadowpulseKDH1 Woolie had an oppurtunity but he farmed investing instead
[5:10:35] <+Gespens> Pokemon
[5:10:38] <%Hawkbone_> Pokemon
[5:10:39] <PleasantLeech> pokemon
[5:10:40] <Klefth> Pokemon, yeah
[5:10:41] <DSD24> Toxic in Dark Souls is pretty rough
[5:10:44] <%Fujiwara_92> pokemon
[5:10:45] <%heartlesshealer> Pokemon
[5:10:48] <RurouniGeo> literally hundreds of games have that Woolie
[5:10:48] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> @th3smartalec But...but that was like 3 hours ago!
[5:10:51] <%kyh9> Pokemon
[5:10:53] <Mr_Ease> honestly ninja might be better than spellsword, just buy vanishes/3 spinners, and run while being immune, since 2 items per turn
[5:10:57] <NeroInfinite> Toxic is fuckin rough man
[5:10:57] <+Gespens> Pokemon kills!
[5:10:57] <+GenesisKnight> Pokemon used to kill you
[5:10:59] <Onmi_Khaos> No in 7 it ends at the end of the battle?
[5:10:59] <%irfan_> old pokemon poison kills, new ones brings you down to 1
[5:11:00] <%legacy0117> It is like a fun karma system that's like bonus out of game stuff.
[5:11:01] <%SilvaChariot0133> Etrian poison :blobsweat:
[5:11:01] <iswearimjustdandy> But pokemon poison cant kill
[5:11:03] <smalls8497> asbestos
[5:11:05] <%kingkeldeo31> Pokemon poison used to kill
[5:11:06] <PleasantLeech> earlier pokemon poison kills
[5:11:11] <%GrassCannon> even in battle?
[5:11:11] <%heartlesshealer> red/blue would faint your pokemon on the map
[5:11:14] <%Th3SmartAlec> @ShadowpulseKDH1 Yeah, Woolie getting Squalled opened the gates for everyone to try and squall each other
[5:11:15] <DedlokPM> It wasn't until recently that it brought you down to 1, Pokemon poison used to ko
[5:11:15] <DSD24> @SilvaChariot0133 Jesus I forgot about Etrian poison
[5:11:18] <%legacy0117> Gives you titles and such.
[5:11:20] <Klefth> No, Pokemon used to outright kill, not bring you down to 1. Wouldn't be surprised if they nerfed that too, 'cause, you know
[5:11:21] <%heartlesshealer> and you could black out on the way to the pokemon center
[5:11:28] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> Lol
[5:11:36] <DSD24> Oh shit are we the Tower Knight now?
[5:11:41] <%zenith0111> woolieMIRIN woolieMIRIN woolieMIRIN woolieMIRIN
[5:11:42] <+soFISHticated98> it goes to one now
[5:11:44] <+Ether101_Prime> A number of Final Fantasy has poison not go away until you deal with it. FF9 has a stronger version called virus that cuts off exp.
[5:11:45] <%Fujiwara_92> earlier poison killed, but cause bugs after gen 4 it brought you down to 1 outta battle
[5:11:48] <+soFISHticated98> it *used* to kill
[5:12:03] <+zegoodknight> you only get the bonus depending on job dont you?
[5:12:07] <%projectmanatees> yes
[5:12:13] <mikesapartment> was that shit called kitten mitten?
[5:12:14] <NeroInfinite> nope
[5:12:14] <gamewarden92> Combine the disciplines of Thief and Magician to learn how to steal from reality.
[5:12:18] <+soFISHticated98> as an alchemist not many weapons give you boosts
[5:12:18] <+Grayhammatter> and now minh is the bigger threat
[5:12:20] <%irfan_> get better magic now please minh
[5:12:23] <The_err0r> It has to be thief based
[5:12:24] <+Cavumentum> And now it's time to make MONEY
[5:12:27] <+soFISHticated98> staves only I think
[5:12:30] <crimsonsaens> Should probably get better Defensive magic
[5:12:33] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Grayhammatter "NOW"???
[5:12:42] <%GrassCannon> he was unarmed
[5:12:44] <+soFISHticated98> daggers usually only give bonus to thieves specifically

[5:13:08] <%Fujiwara_92> Minh has been the bigger threat since episode one LUL

[5:13:37] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @th3smartalec nah man that sounds smart and not reggie like
[5:13:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> Item
[5:13:41] <%legacy0117> This game is just about the field magic and speed, and attack and tanky builds only benefit if you catch the speedy and mage classes that run around like idiots.
[5:13:46] <+soFISHticated98> at the begginning Woolie was the big cheese
[5:13:54] <%EyeFarted> RED CHEST COWARD
[5:13:57] <%Fujiwara_92> RED CHEST
[5:13:58] <+soFISHticated98> attack builds are great for progession
[5:13:59] <%Th3SmartAlec> YEAH
[5:13:59] <%legacy0117> Also good for fighting boss monsters
[5:14:04] <$StaceMcGate> I'll argue with you all night chat, this is the worst filler arc in the series LUL
[5:14:04] <+GenesisKnight> Called it
[5:14:13] <%Fujiwara_92> LUL
[5:14:16] <+DesertPenguin> I'm with Stace
[5:14:26] <Camail> when the french comes out, the emotions are REAL
[5:14:27] <%EvanTheNewbie> Get that Magic D
[5:14:27] <%dastmwolf> agreed
[5:14:29] <PleasantLeech> no the suicide arc is underrated
[5:14:31] <+soFISHticated98> DX
[5:14:32] <crimsonsaens> M Guard DX go
[5:14:34] <%Th3SmartAlec> At the moment Reggie is the only one who can stall Minh
[5:14:36] <worldbrand> he can't keep getting away with this
[5:14:36] <%emperordread> We have seen a LOT of investing in towns though because of the squalls
[5:14:36] <+soFISHticated98> it's the only one he should get
[5:14:38] <%Fujiwara_92> best arc imo
[5:14:39] <DSD24> @StaceMcGate Dokapon Kingdom Breaking Wind act is pretty bad so far
[5:14:41] <PleasantLeech> it really fleshed out the characters
[5:14:44] <CursedNobleman> Fighting Gamers struggle with Long Term Strategy 2020 Colorized
[5:14:44] <%BisoromiBear> This is the thinking man's arc
[5:14:49] <%EvanTheNewbie> MAGIC D
[5:14:52] <Klefth> @StaceMcGate Dude, it's like fucking One Piece's pace at this point
[5:14:54] <%Kriss1827> alot of mind games were played today
[5:15:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> @emperordread Woolie started the trend before the Squalling began
[5:15:04] <%Fujiwara_92> best fucking arc LUL
[5:15:08] <%jiggy_snipe> I still feel like Minh can be killed easily by anything in Australia
[5:15:09] <Onmi_Khaos> Seriously they have to get in the final dungeon ASAP because if they let Minh get out of this cave before they get to the Tower they will never be able to progress
[5:15:10] <%fetrigon> @CursedNobleman LUL LUL
[5:15:12] <+dmtjinni> LUL
[5:15:12] <%Hawkbone_> Hey, on the bright side, the compilations will be godlike
[5:15:19] <%Th3SmartAlec> It's like a Shounen
[5:15:19] <%legacy0117> Reggie, walk into the cave and cave-in Minh's face.
[5:15:21] <%Ashenik1> And I was hoping this will be the last session LUL
[5:15:21] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> Minh absolute ruins them as they fight each other arc is pretty solid.
[5:15:22] <yodajr99> the filler arc of nothing
[5:15:26] <crimsonsaens> M Guard is the best
[5:15:28] <Camail> STRIKE FOR DAYS
[5:15:32] <%xcompleasedad> Jesus FUCK
[5:15:32] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Hawkbone_ We can all agree on this
[5:15:34] <$StaceMcGate> I can't wait till youtube gets 8 episodes of SQUALL
[5:15:39] <yodajr99> every anime has a training arc where nothing happens
[5:15:39] <+green715> FREE STRIKES
[5:15:41] <+soFISHticated98> is anybody secretly a millionaire and can just drop in like 500k
[5:15:41] <%Fujiwara_92> LUL
[5:15:42] <CursedNobleman> its like Aizen vs Goku and Vegeta
[5:15:46] <DiscoDur0> DX
[5:15:47] <%Fujiwara_92> HOLY SHIT
[5:15:48] <Klefth> This is worse than the Rin flashbacks
[5:15:49] <$StaceMcGate> Endless 8 of Dokapon right here folks
[5:15:51] <+Cavumentum> Minh is Rasputin
[5:15:53] <Klefth> NOTHING HAPPENS
[5:15:55] <%kingkeldeo31> But it only works if they get hit by magic
[5:15:57] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[5:16:01] <%Th3SmartAlec> @StaceMcGate There should just be a interlaced photo of Squall's face LUL
[5:16:06] <%fetrigon> LUL
[5:16:06] <%irfan_> THATS WHAT IM SAYING
[5:16:12] <crimsonsaens> Curse is probably the best magic attack for Minh
[5:16:13] <%irfan_> META PROGRESS ALL TIME HIGH
[5:16:19] <%emperordread> Remember when we though thief's were OP because of being able to take one item?
[5:16:20] <%viewtifulr> Donate the blood money if we ccant get 3 manga books from chapter 8
[5:16:23] <%Fujiwara_92> YEAH, HOW PPL NOT LOVING THIS? LUL
[5:16:26] <%legacy0117> Is Squall trapped in caves if the player is in there?
[5:16:33] <thesickestzak> Korean backdashing with all the squalls
[5:16:35] <%dastmwolf> @emperordread we were all so naive lol
[5:16:38] <%viewtifulr> get away*
[5:16:39] <crimsonsaens> Yes
[5:16:44] <%Th3SmartAlec> @legacy0117 You have to be on the same map for it to work
[5:16:49] <+soFISHticated98> status spell is the best one yeah
[5:16:49] <%jiggy_snipe> im hoping Minh gets squalled after he leaves the cave or blown up immediately by an encounter lol
[5:16:54] <$StaceMcGate> Should be a house rule of having to say "Whatever" when casting Squall from here on out

[5:18:17] <%legacy0117> He is trapped in Austraila Paladin, he's stuck there.
[5:18:23] <Onmi_Khaos> i had to look up Spellblade to see why it can turn the game around.
[5:18:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> @nintega010 I hope he actually makes an attempt, but I know he'll go for a 200 IQ play instead
[5:18:28] <%hamahiroyuki> wait, if it seals attack it means you get more likely to get striked, so you can counter?
[5:18:30] <+soFISHticated98> Reggie just admitted that Minh is going to win

[5:18:46] <PleasantLeech> why would you expect balance??
[5:18:51] <%Th3SmartAlec> Dokapon is basically a fighting game
[5:18:52] <ainda_> if Reggie starts bitching about balance when Minh wins im gonna cry
[5:18:53] <%fetrigon> It's really up to the other players to keep them in check and not let them gain momentum.

[5:19:37] <SethKyu> That being said, if you kill the alchemist, you can take all their cash
[5:19:38] <%viewtifulr> @yodajr99 Dont look at them in the eyes
[5:19:52] <%Hawkbone_> "Many consider Spellsword to be one of the worst classes" straight from the Dokapon wiki. However, its skill is a HARD counter to the current meta.

[5:26:07] <countgaculatv> Now time for them to cuddle to sleep to get rid of the bad blood
[5:26:07] <%dastmwolf> these always end in the exact same way. Reggie shoots out of the couch and Minh checks his giant phone
[5:26:08] <Klefth> The most boring session yet.
[5:26:08] <%nintega010> @WoolieVersus It was a hard session today Woolie, but we're by your sides
[5:26:11] <%BisoromiBear> super good content
[5:26:12] <PleasantLeech> suicide arc was extreme mental warfare
[5:26:15] <%emperordread> Bullshit truly blazed

[5:26:31] <%Sparkseid> I enjoyed it, was great
[5:26:34] <Ultimatefool> Reggie with the super town snipe was a highlight
[5:26:39] <%Malik1002> the game has evolved only took 1 million darklings
[5:26:40] <%EvanTheNewbie> Real good day
[5:26:41] <%jiggy_snipe> and with the addition of a spellsword now PogChamp
[5:26:42] <+prime_name> We've entered the Footises Arc
[5:26:49] <%heroversusofficial> Reggie town snipe is making such a huge difference
[5:26:51] <%C4m3r0n0409> Woolie invest the new continent and youll be in the game
[5:26:53] <gamewarden92> Also, Reggie getting mouse dragged to South America.
[5:26:53] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:26:58] <+primax104> yo that sneak hit ko was awesome

[5:27:03] <%legacy0117> And that is Chapter 11 of Dokapon the Manga series...I have to write a story for this, so, I hope it doesn't bore everyone.
[5:27:05] <Monkeyweed21> How's Yarra Woolie?
[5:27:14] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> @primax104 That was awesome!
[5:27:20] <Camail> sneak hit is bullshit
[5:27:21] <+nekodelic> this was the staring contest part of the episode
[5:27:23] <lotharrio> Sneak Hit paid off.
[5:27:24] <%jiggy_snipe> Rico Sr appears, that stolen and destroyed guide warp, sneak hit, LUL

[5:27:49] <%emperordread> It was a great point to start off a new session tbh - everyone got something goin on
[5:27:51] <countgaculatv> Honestly, Minh discovering his true self was the best
[5:27:55] <jubejube56> Lol Minh is definitely getting squalled the second he leaves that cave
[5:27:55] <thesickestzak> nliLUL
[5:28:05] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[5:28:07] <%fetrigon> Minh is so well prepared.

[5:28:12] <+primax104> primax104 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[5:28:14] <%Superdandy96> Minh’s full heel swerve was nuts!
[5:28:15] <%perfectsalami> betrayal
[5:28:23] <%legacy0117> And Minh admitted his villainy.
[5:28:26] <Jflaskd13> LUL
[5:28:28] <JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> TASTE?
[5:28:29] <Monkeyweed21> Minh embraced the philosopher's stone and Reggie got a Kishimoto powerup to counter minh
[5:28:30] <Camail> the taste of shit
[5:28:30] <%fetrigon> Next session is gonna be interesting...
[5:28:38] <+pkmamsters> I want to hear Minh and Reggie have a french conversation
[5:28:45] <thesickestzak> Taste of a coward
[5:28:45] <+Grayhammatter> i wanna see how many reflects reggie gets
[5:28:53] <%jiggy_snipe> 13 I think
[5:28:55] <blue2red> LuvPeekL
[5:28:55] <%Amaideus> Is Minh even gonna target him though?
[5:29:02] <%legacy0117> Reggie now has to die and get in front of Minh in Austraila.
[5:29:06] <%Amaideus> 50% is high enough to get Minh to think twice
[5:29:06] <%SHMARIO> THX @QaizerArt
[5:29:15] <kngmatthias> Ive never seen a Lets Play so dull. The energy isn't healthy LUL
[5:29:19] <%Amaideus> He'd only try in a last ditch effort
[5:29:22] <+Grayhammatter> oof
[5:29:25] <%legacy0117> If he does, that will give them a decent chance.
[5:29:28] <%kyh9> In fighting games in general?
[5:29:33] <countgaculatv> I think he meant in general

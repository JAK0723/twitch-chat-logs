[0:12:34] <%Irridium> was it pat and did dave oshrey call him a bitch baby live on-stream again
[0:12:38] <%justmildlilac> @woolieversus It's not a backdown, just an option select woolieGASM

[0:12:49] <%A_DEAD_SHOW> A_DEAD_SHOW subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! Hello woolie, I've always wondered what would be your movelist on a Fighting game,we all know Reggie would be a shoto because he's lame shit, but how would you play? A boxer, big heavy damage, what moves?
[0:12:49] <%masterfire23> woolie become esports
[0:12:51] <%Solidnick18> i like the soundtrack
[0:12:52] <%SilverRoddo> The hold-back, charged backdown
[0:13:00] <+EdenOfLove> Is it just me or do voices sound weird today?
[0:13:08] <%Solidnick18> i saw a video of the dev playing
[0:13:19] <%Reverend_Roscoe> IT KEEPS YOUR GERMS IN YOU FUCK
[0:13:26] <+Aheg0d> mask is to catch the droplets
[0:13:29] <%Prevot> you dont KNOW you're healthy
[0:13:29] <Personified134> we gunstylin tonight
[0:13:38] <EternalJedi> masks MOSTLY catch YOUR outgoing stuff, but it does help SOME with incoming
[0:13:39] <$BallerSwagBro9k> How is this hard to understand?
[0:13:43] <Manwad> imagine believing you can't be a carrier
[0:13:45] <%Prevot> you might be spreading but not sick yet
[0:13:46] <%LavenderLaser> FPSSS night
[0:13:47] <%pectusumbra> It's mainly for not spraying everyone
[0:13:48] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Masks can also reduce infection by 12% in people who don't have it
[0:13:49] <+Double_Tap_That> I haven't played the game myself, but I've heard binding reload to right mouse button apparently makes this game more fun to play.
[0:13:49] <+DesertPenguin> Oh god are we really talking about this shit....
[0:13:51] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @WoolieVersus THAT'S CORRECT
[0:13:52] <%Ranryu692> it's literally a face condom
[0:13:57] <Personified134> Hey woolie I sent you a clip of a VTuber fucking people up in Titanfall on twitter
[0:14:00] <BlackermanZX> its... not that hard to understand doodHokey
[0:14:00] <andrewofbob> Everyone is a potential carrier with no symptoms
[0:14:02] <+toastybites> and if everyone prevents their own droplets from spraying, then the amount of contact everyone has to droplets go down
[0:14:04] <%Spydurman> Masks help if you're in the incubation period
[0:14:06] <+rj1771> The mask thing is simple: it keeps YOU from breathing shit all over shit, it's not to keep you from breathing in shit.
[0:14:12] <+Ragnakawaii> asymptomatic people can still spread the virus and symptoms don't set in until like 2 weeks
[0:14:13] <%Solidnick18> i'm just staying away
[0:14:17] <+DesertPenguin> Better safe than sorry
[0:14:21] <spidervenomized> better safe than sorry
[0:14:33] <+DesertPenguin> Makes sense
[0:14:35] <+DesertPenguin> Yes
[0:14:37] <+Aheg0d> If I dont have a mask can i use a dental dam instead?

[0:18:09] <+JustToWatch> it's out, and apparently you can walk 69 kilometers way from an objective and the game still has geography
[0:18:11] <%RyTYoung> it is indeed

[0:36:13] <spawnzie> I mean if you cant' move and shoot you might as well go controller right now
[0:36:17] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Maybe lower sensitivity it a bit
[0:36:18] <BlackermanZX> Might want to get a little less sensitivity
[0:36:21] <%Solidnick18> woolies on it

[0:39:03] <mdkcde> Hey, I really like this game
[0:39:16] <TBFeric> @WoolieVersus between fights, dashing around on-beat will help you stay in the flow for the next fight
[0:39:27] <mdkcde> You reset the combo when you miss the rythm
[0:39:30] <mdkcde> you can miss shots
[0:39:33] <thespoforth> It resets if you get hit or mess up the rythm
[0:39:36] <BlackermanZX> you can dash?
[0:39:38] <mdkcde> but if you miss the rythm it punishes you
[0:39:41] <Jaller101514> when you miss a beat, not hit

[0:40:39] <+Conner3326> i put my dash on a mouse button
[0:40:40] <%Irridium> yeah I moved dash to a mouse button
[0:40:41] <Manwad> if your mouse has more buttons, just bind it to that
[0:40:42] <+Javaa01> Dashing MUST be on the rhythm
[0:40:44] <letshavecakes> Ultrakill has two of those, lol
[0:40:44] <ZeeJiggle> You can always remap stuff!
[0:40:45] <brian_peppers1> Is that.....is that AN ACTUAL KEYBAORD Woolie is using wtf?!?!?!
[0:40:46] <dukenux> Time to train your pinky then

[0:40:52] <Nekros4442> You can always remap it ;p
[0:40:52] <andrewofbob> Biggest tech in FPS: strafe in a circle and keep looking at the same target.
[0:40:53] <TBFeric> you can put dash on L1 I think

[0:41:16] <dukenux> oh you can nvm
[0:41:17] <mdkcde> You would be better off remapping the reload and dash to your mouse
[0:41:18] <TungstenViper> Woolie you gotta strafe
[0:41:27] <+StrawberryPantsu> Woolie doesn't have one of those fancy mice with the extra buttons on the side?
[0:41:30] <+relentingapunch> Finna be big backdowns
[0:41:39] <BlackermanZX> sensitivity might be a lil high for you

[0:42:21] <+WorldsBestPanda> The first step to ascension is accepting one's own weakness.
[0:42:24] <nintega010> can woolie not play with his set up
[0:42:32] <Finchit> high sens is good for arcade shooters
[0:42:39] <$BallerSwagBro9k> If Woolie doesnt master M/K he will never get his Epic Gamer license

[0:45:22] <TungstenViper> NOT COWARD
[0:45:23] <BlackermanZX> dont do this to yourself LUL
[0:45:25] <+robobeau> Bust out the Overwatch setup
[0:45:25] <Sonicdy> Just backdown, woolie
[0:45:27] <donstylo> Woolie is for the People!
[0:45:27] <+JonJonRequiem> Just gotta keep practicing
[0:45:27] <+paladinstarbuster> woolie would never handle touhou
[0:45:27] <%chll0ne> LUL
[0:45:29] <%Sparkseid> it's not worth it
[0:45:30] <+MisterAvry> it's not that bad
[0:45:32] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> no one cares which you use, just aim
[0:45:32] <Finchit> Nah this is too much for the inexpeirenced. real talk
[0:45:32] <NicLoson> We want you to have fun man, use the controller
[0:45:34] <+MazDoThing> Nah man, you gave it a proper shot. This ain't the game to go in on trying to learn
[0:45:34] <$BallerSwagBro9k> WAX ON WAX OFF
[0:45:34] <%emperordread> But drop in to the F1 tho
[0:45:34] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @mdkcde
[0:45:37] <+DesertPenguin> No worries
[0:45:38] <%SirGO0SE> GET IN THE F1 Woolie!
[0:45:38] <%masterfire23> just click the head 4Head
[0:45:38] <+Ketronox> Use your controller, coward! Do what makes you comfortable.
[0:45:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> YOU DO YOU
[0:45:40] <Johannen> Now lets see Woolie fail the same way with a gamepad, that'l be some content
[0:45:40] <PettyFunk> IDK if it's worth it if you aren't really investing time getting familiar with it, especially if you don't intend to use it in the future
[0:45:41] <%mitchteck> You’re fine wollie
[0:45:41] <MKII> get this semi truck cross-country, woolie
[0:45:42] <+Aheg0d> Trail by fire always works
[0:45:42] <wibbwobbler> LET'S GO
[0:45:42] <Klownkommander> woolie projecting super hard calling us "the enraged"
[0:45:43] <SpaceCatStation> @RioGascar the game has a option to ignore the rhythm inputs
[0:45:44] <yusefHD> punished woolz
[0:45:44] <%YakumoYomi> No one's "enraged. They're just messing with you.
[0:45:45] <Torgue_1> Bit of a hyperbole
[0:45:46] <zenith0111> SEARCH YOUR FEELINGS
[0:45:46] <Zayasu> PogChamp
[0:45:48] <andrewofbob> Tbh, the aim was ok, you’re just eating damage for nothing
[0:45:49] <%Solidnick18> if you want to it's ok
[0:45:55] <+MisterAvry> That was great
[0:45:57] <TungstenViper> GOTTA STRAFE
[0:45:58] <+relentingapunch> f l a w l e s s
[0:45:59] <sponsored_by_disney> easy mode
[0:46:01] <Sonicdy> Its fine, wools, just backdown
[0:46:01] <Manwad> @RioGascar The crosshair isn't a true crosshair, it has a level of lockon in the middle, and as far as I know there's no headshots of any sort. So keep rhythm or get slapped.
[0:46:02] <R3Roundabout> " I know you guys are unreasonable idiots, but I'm gonna pretend to comply so I can feel safe bitching about this"
[0:46:05] <%eanscrale> I didin't think you could have Johns in a pve experience
[0:46:05] <mdkcde> someone please tell him to remap the dash to the mouse
[0:46:06] <Finchit> fighting the boss early is fine.
[0:46:07] <+MisterAvry> Good room, Woolz
[0:46:08] <andrewofbob> Survival is king in roguelikes.
[0:46:08] <+Javaa01> @WoolieVersus Hyper precise aiming is not required in this game, as long as what you're trying to shoot at is in the rhythm box in the middle of the screen the game will autoaim for you
[0:46:08] <Zayasu> learn it :)
[0:46:09] <Dumple_Roe> is he training his...PINKY?!
[0:46:09] <zenith0111> MULTI TASKING HARD
[0:46:11] <%ozmon> It seems pretty general for Roguelites to kill you 20 times before you can play it
[0:46:12] <+DesertPenguin> @mield916 Maybe don't?
[0:46:12] <%Plus_On_Black> Fuck all that, use the controller
[0:46:15] <letshavecakes> Chat forcing woolie to play worse and make worse content by playing on his fears of being a called a bitch lmao
[0:46:19] <%ozmon> There's a minimap woolie LUL
[0:46:22] <khetrak> i spend all my life play fps on PC, i think the only shooter i play on a console was metal gear, its so weird to me to see people more used to that
[0:46:30] <+MisterAvry> Good!
[0:46:44] <donstylo> Woolie this is not Resident Evil 4, you can shoot and move. xD Sorry for the mean joke.
[0:46:44] <andre11dr> uptime!
[0:46:50] <slawson619> Planning on playing the L4D dlc soon?
[0:46:52] <%Solidnick18> do the gamer woolie
[0:46:58] <+CatastropheCorvid> People need to chill, just use what's comfortable. If they couldn't see your hands they'd have nothing to whine about.
[0:47:00] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Remap dash to space or whatever button you feel comfortable with. Thats the power of rebinds
[0:47:07] <Klownkommander> @khetrak I mean I've always played console but I can still play pretty well on m+kb
[0:47:07] <zenith0111> Moving and shooting is a struggle LUL
[0:47:07] <andre11dr> !uptime
[0:47:08] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 47 minutes and 19 seconds
[0:47:10] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[0:47:12] <+MisterAvry> He was doing good on that tho
[0:47:13] <BlackermanZX> use controller woolz LUL
[0:47:13] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @khetrak Same I I legit cannot aim for shit with a controller. It feels alien in my hands
[0:47:14] <+MeatBomb> Solid attempt.
[0:47:17] <mdkcde> change the dash and reload to the mouse
[0:47:18] <Tuna_Can_0> @slawson619 Left 4 Dead? what year is it? WutFace
[0:47:20] <$BallerSwagBro9k> LET REGGIE TRY
[0:47:25] <+Donchalant402> I looked away, why isnt he using controller
[0:47:25] <+MisterAvry> He's making strides
[0:47:28] <zenith0111> PUT REGGIE ON
[0:47:30] <R3Roundabout> If you can't even circle strafe, just switch
[0:47:30] <+RenoDeGeneric> Put dash on a mouse button
[0:47:32] <$BallerSwagBro9k> I bet Reggie would crush it
[0:47:37] <+MoistHeinous> would it work to sound out the best out loud?
[0:47:43] <+robobeau> Bust out the Controller + Mouse tech
[0:47:46] <+MoistHeinous> beat
[0:47:47] <TungstenViper> Woolie have you ever tried Overwatch?
[0:47:47] <+MisterAvry> Remapping some controls would probably be good
[0:47:48] <Sonicdy> Just backdown, wools, no girl seeing this anyways
[0:47:50] <+MeatBomb> Gaining pinkie dex is painful.
[0:48:04] <andrewofbob> Bind dash to mouse4?
[0:48:12] <%masterfire23> @tungstenviper hes played overwatch
[0:48:14] <%RyTYoung> MOAR
[0:48:14] <%ozmon> ya

[0:48:17] <JonnyJug> You did good
[0:48:17] <Zayasu> no
[0:48:20] <+MazDoThing> Yup
[0:48:20] <1MadLadd> NO
[0:48:21] <%holydeviant1> I like Ultrakill better as a game, honestly
[0:48:22] <zenith0111> PUT REGGIE ON
[0:48:23] <+maybefalco> you were making progess
[0:48:23] <khetrak> NO
[0:48:25] <yusefHD> VoteNay VoteNay VoteNay
[0:48:25] <+MisterAvry> I thought you were doing alright
[0:48:25] <+charp35> it's cool switch if you want
[0:48:25] <Sonicdy> Next bit pls
[0:48:25] <+Donchalant402> woolie you gotta dash way more
[0:48:25] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> I think Woolie is more enraged than chat
[0:48:27] <andre11dr> I just got here
[0:48:27] <dfs_k> you legit tried
[0:48:27] <+DesertPenguin> NO DO IT AGAIN
[0:48:28] <TungstenViper> NOPE :)
[0:48:28] <+Darkdragon191> games not for u wollie about all i can say
[0:48:29] <JaseAdrift> We get it woolie your a coward
[0:48:30] <StarvingPenguinGod> that was pretty good
[0:48:30] <mdkcde> CONTROLLEr time
[0:48:32] <+Thomzzz> this game is harsh af
[0:48:32] <townzzzzz> baby hands woolie
[0:48:33] <BlackermanZX> i was satisfied the first death LUL
[0:48:35] <%FuqBoiSlim> BODIED KEKW
[0:48:36] <+Bailey__gaming> Inc Steel Beal lion controller to play this
[0:48:36] <californaya> You tried wrong tho
[0:48:37] <+HellHunter120> It's a good idea to learn how to use K+B, but you'd have a better time with something less immediately demanding
[0:48:38] <+b_aleph> So Woolie can't play this game...?
[0:48:39] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @khetrak
[0:48:39] <%ozmon> It's super fun though when you have more than a minute
[0:48:40] <+DesertPenguin> So..... Ultrakill?
[0:48:41] <mellorolo> i def y
[0:48:42] <mield916> Switch to controller, but also dont fight the final boss of the zone
[0:48:44] <$BallerSwagBro9k> If he want to switch to controller FINE. But no half and half shit. NOT IN MY HOUSE LUL
[0:48:44] <snakemuho> Ok boomer
[0:48:44] <%RyTYoung> You would've done better than me if I used mouse and keyboard Woolie
[0:48:48] <zenith0111> WOOLIE CAN'T PLAY LUL
[0:48:56] <+Donchalant402> just play on controller dude
[0:48:56] <%emperordread> Suffer for us
[0:48:57] <+MisterAvry> Stop singling out the unreasonable
[0:48:58] <Finchit> its okay grandpa its fine. moving and shooting is hard
[0:48:58] <PettyFunk> Like others said, taking the time to get used to it with something less demanding might be good
[0:48:58] <+Donchalant402> its much easier
[0:48:59] <DSD24> Switch to what you prefer Woolie
[0:49:00] <MKII> we expect no less than victory now
[0:49:01] <1MadLadd> unresonable?
[0:49:02] <%FuqBoiSlim> BOP
[0:49:02] <+Donchalant402> the game feels good on controller
[0:49:04] <donstylo> At least you tried.
[0:49:04] <TungstenViper> is the hand motion synch the issue or the keyboard controls?
[0:49:05] <DSD24> Don't suffer for us
[0:49:06] <BlackermanZX> CUBE GONE
[0:49:06] <yusefHD> MingLee
[0:49:09] <khetrak> @WoolieVersus when you reach the point where i can see blood on that keyboard, you can change
[0:49:12] <andre11dr> Woolie was E X P O S ED
[0:49:17] <%Solidnick18> the cube proved to be the downfall
[0:49:20] <JaseAdrift> Being very Reasonable
[0:49:20] <mdkcde> I spent 5k point trying to warn woolie, thanks Chat
[0:49:20] <%dots4eyes> If he gets bodied harder on controller....
[0:49:21] <+Bailey__gaming> time to bind some keys
[0:49:23] <zenith0111> OKAY NOW FOR THE REAL ATTEMPT
[0:49:26] <Mnemonicjohnny> Yo, @WoolieVersus , just dropping in: you might wanna remap reload to a mouse-button if you don't have it there already
[0:49:28] <%emperordread> Assuming Direct Control(ler)
[0:49:28] <JaseAdrift> Balls exposed on stream
[0:49:30] <Darkdrill> PogChamp he tryed his best
[0:49:37] <%venomryu> @WoolieVersus (chanting) woolie woolie woolie you can do it
[0:49:38] <Klownkommander> Woolie amd the guys did Omikron but this is too much suffer?
[0:49:45] <ZeeJiggle> This screen could do with a background to read is better against the blurry
[0:49:48] <dukeoftime> B IS NOTHING
[0:49:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> You guys are always having trouble reading on that far screen. Fix your setup if you can.
[0:49:55] <ZeeJiggle> B FOR NOTHIN
[0:49:58] <%SaiyanShoto> Controller as god intended
[0:50:03] <R3Roundabout> Remember when Woolie complained about Pat not having the right mindset when reading superman. Getting those vibes from this controller bullshit
[0:50:17] <%SirGO0SE> SourPls
[0:50:17] <Darkdrill> woolie shoot do a woolie vs mouse and keyboard skitt
[0:50:20] <mdkcde> It helps
[0:50:23] <BlackermanZX> you might want just a bit of sensitivity
[0:50:24] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:50:24] <+Donchalant402> I cant wait still get gets to the second world
[0:50:27] <zenith0111> LMAO
[0:50:29] <andre11dr> @klownkommander Omikron was penance for all their sins
[0:50:36] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Reggie calling him out LUL
[0:50:39] <%RyTYoung> Head nods help keep the beat too
[0:50:56] <Darkdrill> woolie needs those helo settings
[0:50:58] <letshavecakes> Keyboard purists absolutely malding

[0:51:06] <BlackermanZX> its not even
[0:51:08] <+Donchalant402> practise dashes a bit
[0:51:08] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Instant motion sickness LUL
[0:51:11] <%SirGO0SE> my ears are cum
[0:51:12] <mdkcde> don't get out until you're ready
[0:51:13] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> If you need to stop to shoot, it's too high
[0:51:15] <mdkcde> there's no need to hurry
[0:51:20] <zenith0111> WOOLIES KRYPTONITE
[0:51:29] <%ozmon> Aiming could very well be a bitch now
[0:51:31] <+Donchalant402> gotta constantly dash, def something you should always get down
[0:51:33] <+JustToWatch> that's how it is on this bitch of an earth
[0:51:33] <+VoytekBus> FPS ain't for me either
[0:51:35] <MKII> keyboard was only holding him back! time for the first try win!
[0:51:40] <%mixedelirium> woolieDATTEBAYO this is not a woolie game
[0:51:53] <mdkcde> give money to the statue
[0:51:54] <BlackermanZX> yeah its too high it seems
[0:51:54] <JaseAdrift> Woolie is the games Journalist now
[0:52:04] <mellorolo> brains have been found to sync upon hearing music
[0:52:10] <+Ez3z> woolie making a concerted effort to be good at fps might give some insight on how it feels to try and get good at fighting games
[0:52:10] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> KEYYyy
[0:52:11] <j3sharp> K E Y
[0:52:11] <Darkdrill> his up sense seems a bit to ghigh
[0:52:12] <mdkcde> Givce money to statues
[0:52:19] <+SauceyItalian> bruh the key to life is just to vibe
[0:52:19] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Yo, sick keys
[0:52:20] <zenith0111> YOU'RE PLAYING A MUSIC VIDEO
[0:52:32] <mdkcde> Give money to statues to raise your stats
[0:52:38] <+MisterAvry> why is this whole game so damn ORANGE?
[0:52:39] <Klownkommander> @jaseadrift first I thought you were being too mean. then I realized that you may be right
[0:52:40] <mikesapartment> much better
[0:52:40] <mdkcde> get it
[0:52:43] <mdkcde> Stat Statues
[0:52:53] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> A feeling, deep inside
[0:52:55] <%RyTYoung> Do fps
[0:52:57] <andre11dr> So is this a quick look right?
[0:53:01] <%xcompleasedad> Uh oh
[0:53:09] <+A_mere_shrubb> why he reload so often?
[0:53:23] <mdkcde> @A_mere_shrubb to keep the rythm
[0:53:23] <KiILLIO> Because it sounds HYPE
[0:53:26] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> The fear
[0:53:29] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> FULL LP
[0:53:36] <Johannen> I noticed your reload droped you score from 3x to 1x
[0:53:46] <+relentingapunch> f l a w l e s s
[0:53:47] <andrewofbob> Because it’s better than clicking your empty gun. Woolie has learned the habit.
[0:53:50] <+Javaa01> Extra damage on headshots
[0:53:51] <R3Roundabout> @JaseAdrift I'm getting flashbacks to Doom 2016 gameplay
[0:53:52] <zenith0111> Why are you reloading like every 2 shots? LUL
[0:53:54] <Finchit> more crit
[0:53:59] <nintega010> I would like to see Max play this
[0:54:17] <Finchit> passively gives more crit
[0:54:17] <mdkcde> Give money to statues to increase your stats
[0:54:18] <+Javaa01> Gear bonuses are passive
[0:54:20] <+MisterAvry> Crit go up, what more do you need?
[0:54:33] <letshavecakes> Most roguelites take a good while for you to get that confident flow going, and it seems this one will take even longer in that regard

[0:55:06] <+relentingapunch> Birb
[0:55:06] <+Donchalant402> always do boss last of course
[0:55:10] <+Donchalant402> I love hugin

[0:55:16] <+Javaa01> No overheal with HP
[0:55:33] <mdkcde> statueeeee
[0:55:40] <+MisterAvry> does the music change as you get a bigger combo?
[0:55:50] <mdkcde> @MisterAvry nope
[0:55:52] <mdkcde> only bosses
[0:55:57] <mdkcde> as you damage them more
[0:56:07] <%GeneralSCPatton> Aggressive contact damage
[0:56:18] <R3Roundabout> click click
[0:56:19] <+Donchalant402> stop standing still dude
[0:56:36] <+Bailey__gaming> you can't jump over enemy's
[0:56:42] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus You were trying to reload on full
[0:56:44] <Finchit> yes you can
[0:56:51] <Finchit> you can def jump over enemies
[0:56:58] <mdkcde> This is a good strategy
[0:57:09] <+Donchalant402> @WoolieVersus try constantly dashing, it'll help you stay on rhythm
[0:57:13] <wibbwobbler> dashing over enemies has damaged u every time so far
[0:57:16] <+Javaa01> @WoolieVersus If you dash and keep holding, you get a sprint for running through cleared rooms
[0:57:18] <letshavecakes> Is this game gonna have a bleeding effect and make Woolie play Ultrakill on beat
[0:57:21] <TBFeric> @WoolieVersus dashing while out of combat really helps keep you in the flow btw, like just dashing everywhere
[0:57:25] <TomosukeUsagi> FeelsGoodMan birb

[0:57:42] <+Donchalant402> ayyy he gets it
[0:57:44] <Equirah> It's decreasing your score
[0:57:46] <zenith0111> The dash effect is so intense
[0:57:49] <DSD24> What a fancy hat
[0:58:03] <Johannen> Are those active items?
[0:58:03] <Finchit> its passive
[0:58:15] <+Donchalant402> maybe it shows on enemy shot?
[0:58:15] <spidervenomized> it passive
[0:58:19] <mdkcde> Now you're reading reggie
[0:58:20] <+Donchalant402> I haven't seen that on eyet
[0:58:22] <Finchit> Shoot enemies then they explode after a second
[0:58:23] <mdkcde> Money on the statues
[0:58:24] <+Fattness132> timed explosives go off after a few seconds hitting an enemy
[0:58:25] <+Javaa01> If you hit an enemy, a secondary explosion goes off after a second
[0:58:28] <+MisterAvry> You're passive!
[0:58:30] <mdkcde> THERE!
[0:58:36] <mdkcde> It's the autoaim
[0:58:41] <Finchit> precision is crit chance
[0:59:09] <mellorolo> @mdkcde they look like they got you
[0:59:13] <+relentingapunch> Cooked
[0:59:14] <mdkcde> It's a Color Up
[0:59:16] <andrewofbob> How many until a Smart Pistol?
[0:59:24] <+Donchalant402> @WoolieVersus there was a second chest in that chest room on the map
[0:59:26] <Finchit> wait you right precision is auto aim
[0:59:36] <+Donchalant402> you take damage getting to it
[0:59:40] <andre11dr> Im really confused on wha
[0:59:48] <+Javaa01> @WoolieVersus The boss drops a few coins, and you can keep exploring after killing the boss
[0:59:53] <+Fattness132> you can sprint by holding down the dash button
[0:59:57] <+relentingapunch> Shields to health
[0:59:58] <+D00msDayDan> weirdest interpretations of hugin and munin i've seen since ace combat 7
[1:00:02] <+Javaa01> This does nothing for you right now
[1:00:04] <Finchit> no you dont
[1:00:04] <mdkcde> not now
[1:00:05] <+Donchalant402> not yet you dont
[1:00:13] <+Donchalant402> shield works like soul hearts in issac
[1:00:13] <mdkcde> that;s money
[1:00:21] <mdkcde> that's a one use item
[1:00:23] <dfs_k> shoields are like blue hearts, you don't have any yet
[1:00:24] <Equirah> it's not a swap!
[1:00:39] <+Javaa01> That's a one use item, when you pick it up it turns all your armor into permanent health
[1:00:45] <+Donchalant402> still got a chest you can get
[1:00:45] <+relentingapunch> He's doing the thing
[1:00:47] <PettyFunk> I'm assuming the other one was a swap since you can only wear one hat
[1:00:52] <Equirah> score is going down with each of those dashes
[1:01:08] <%Solidnick18> now feel the tythm
[1:01:09] <%ozmon> You make your own music
[1:01:34] <andre11dr> So most upgrades are for all of the run right? No temporarys

[1:02:49] <+Donchalant402> @WoolieVersus something you need to watch out for is because your range stat isnt high yet your bullets dont go too far
[1:03:07] <+Javaa01> That's the door to the next level
[1:03:07] <%RioGascar> Does speed up mean the bpm goes up???
[1:03:15] <+Fattness132> no, you just move faster
[1:03:18] <+Javaa01> Speed is just raw movement speed

[1:19:11] <%Solidnick18> do it baybeee
[1:19:17] <%dots4eyes> When they're speaking off the beat...it's just freestyling
[1:19:28] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus If you planning on Half-Life 2 dont be discouraged by purists. Mmod only updates the combat up to modern standarts. Even on release it was quite basic.
[1:19:33] <letshavecakes> Does this thing have a speedloader upgrade
[1:19:43] <mdkcde> you dashed INTO the attack
[1:19:45] <+Donchalant402> left right left right
[1:19:47] <+Javaa01> @WoolieVersus The beat counter tells you what direction to dodge
[1:19:48] <+Fattness132> no, but therre is a no reload / infinite ammo item
[1:19:49] <nintega010> You was getting there
[1:19:51] <j3sharp> that was great

[1:19:59] <mdkcde> That revolver is the best starter gun
[1:20:00] <$RunningNGunning> How well does the game control on controller?
[1:20:04] <andrewofbob> HL2 already has a sprint, anyway.
[1:20:09] <mdkcde> they nerfed the handheld shotgun
[1:20:09] <+TehBeerBaron> He's doing the thriller
[1:20:10] <+Donchalant402> @RunningNGunning it feels good on controller imo
[1:20:11] <Finchit> different guns have different reloads. there is a buff that gives infinite ammo

[1:20:42] <+relentingapunch> Damage door
[1:20:45] <letshavecakes> It's just common sense that a shotgun is not a long range engagement
[1:20:45] <+Donchalant402> still needs key
[1:20:46] <Johannen> @andrewofbob Yeah HL2 had sprint and flashlight on the same energy bar. Which they changed with episodes

[1:22:23] <+Javaa01> Yeah you want both fingers back there
[1:22:23] <+Fattness132> on m+kb i had to rebind reload to a side mouse button since it was tricky keeping it on just R

[1:22:25] <+KR_Black> REGGIE I GONNA CALL THE COPS
[1:22:26] <crob_og> this game is sick nasty. brb tho. need my phone to actually charge, haha. peace
[1:22:28] <+mczarklesby> British riflemen in late 19th early 20th did the middle finger firing for faster reloads. PRECEDENCE.
[1:22:30] <+b_aleph> I shoot with th middle finger with DS4
[1:22:31] <%justmildlilac> Time for tekken fingers
[1:22:31] <AGRO_91> that's my standard, there's 2 button there
[1:22:34] <lazerscraper> tekken fingers
[1:22:46] <JonnyJug> Middle finger on trigger is pro-strats

[1:23:20] <%RioGascar> oh man frame rate being fucked up is probably DOOM for a rhythm game
[1:23:22] <%YakumoYomi> Even the death was on-beat
[1:23:27] <+Harro8> this is the equivalent of white ppl dancing
[1:23:27] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Gamepad FPS requires both sticks be engaged in combat, reload is fine in most games on face buttons but here you might need it on some other buttons
[1:23:39] <+robobeau> Lemme try the double finger thing - Reggie
[1:23:50] <wibbwobbler> claw style, huh?
[1:24:04] <%Prevot> sometimes I try to double finger but its kinda hard to do
[1:24:05] <letshavecakes> That is not claw lmao
[1:24:12] <Hammatime8> I hit R2 with my middle finger all the time. It's okay, I already know I'm outta my mind
[1:24:17] <%Reveresao> There a Hero character from the MOBA Paragon as a Boss in this game.
[1:24:17] <+Donchalant402> thats the sword of damocles
[1:24:33] <+D00msDayDan> i ended up using that kind of grip a few times in i think bloodborne
[1:24:34] <NicholasOsen_> I use my pointer for the face buttons and middle for triggers
[1:24:36] <nintega010> Really you don't use your middle finger for R2 and index for R1? Wow
[1:24:40] <DSD24> Paragon was cool
[1:24:43] <FrootusClopootus> @WoolieVersus you can double jump on half beats
[1:24:44] <T_Sasquatch> @reveresao basically every character is from Paragon

[1:27:24] <T_Sasquatch> @tux_3do it's actually a robot LUL
[1:27:46] <+DesertPenguin> It's magazine-fed
[1:27:59] <+Javaa01> Magazine fed shotguns are a very real thing, but not that represented in vidya, cause they're a bitch to balance
[1:28:00] <Hammatime8> Mag-fed shotties are totally a thing
[1:28:00] <+D00msDayDan> magazine-fed shotguns are totally a thing but woolie isn't a gun nut so i'm not surprised he doesn't know
[1:28:16] <Jashter18> The Halo shotty reloads from the bottom tho Woolie
[1:28:18] <%RioGascar> lots of weird guns are not shown in video games
[1:28:40] <%RioGascar> The uh director guy for gloomwood has talked about some crazy cool guns that have people scream its not a real gun
[1:28:44] <PulverKong> funny how all of twitch chat are gun experts tho :P
[1:28:49] <alphalejandro> Chocobo

[1:29:04] <T_Sasquatch> Iggy and scorch NotLikeThis
[1:29:09] <+Donchalant402> @WoolieVersus in the settings you can turn down the saturation per world so that shit dont burn into your eyes so hard
[1:29:10] <%Prevot> shake that egg layer
[1:29:10] <wibbwobbler> i found my stand
[1:29:13] <%RioGascar> Thats just a chocobo
[1:29:23] <+Lolo27234> ey woolie in on indie shooters now sweet
[1:29:28] <tux_3do> i love when people stream bpm and they start speaking on beat LUL
[1:29:29] <+YabbaTroll> dont forget double barrel
[1:29:34] <Hammatime8> From the top? What?
[1:29:48] <andrewofbob> That shotgun was also full auto
[1:29:51] <alphalejandro> is asegardian
[1:29:52] <IncredibleMeh> isn't this a character from paragon?
[1:29:54] <+Fattness132> its an old Paragon model - after it closed down epic made the assets free to use
[1:29:55] <T_Sasquatch> Sevarog was rad
[1:29:59] <Johannen> You killed the "rescue squad" in one of the endings with that autoshotgun Woolie)
[1:30:04] <+D00msDayDan> he also didn't realize the aa-12 was a shotgun when he used it
[1:30:12] <DianaTheAscian> didn't re2r have a shotgun like that as well?
[1:30:18] <Finchit> panic shooting LUL
[1:30:23] <+Donchalant402> YE
[1:30:27] <+YabbaTroll> yall actin like it doesnt make mario jump farther
[1:30:33] <tux_3do> when you melee in a first person shooter and you lunge forward thinking the range increases
[1:30:38] <%Reveresao> my boy Severog BibleThump BibleThump
[1:30:43] <%GeneralSCPatton> THE BOSS FINISHER IS FREESTYLE NO-BEAT?
[1:30:47] <+Lolo27234> use those parappa skills
[1:30:52] <T_Sasquatch> If anyone is interested Paragon is being remade by 3 different companies . So there are 3 different remakes out right now
[1:30:56] <+Javaa01> Yeah you get to freestyle on the boss
[1:31:00] <%FuqBoiSlim> punch kick its all in the mind
[1:31:06] <+Donchalant402> @WoolieVersus the chest room there was a damage chest
[1:31:14] <JonnyJug> Hold dash to run
[1:31:16] <+Javaa01> The final boss gets a double length freestyle
[1:31:19] <+TTTeha> you can hold the dash button to sprint
[1:31:19] <BlackermanZX> you can run right
[1:31:23] <+Javaa01> So you get to style extra hard
[1:31:37] <walrus_gumboot_> is the entire game this color or is it just this level?
[1:31:40] <+LynbellDaYo> since when is Reggie allowed to play video games, what's up
[1:31:43] <+TopTieramisu> JUSTICE

[1:32:10] <walrus_gumboot_> @T_Sasquatch cool
[1:32:14] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Does shooting stops sprinting?
[1:32:14] <+Javaa01> You shouldn't be sprinting in combat, since it totals your side to side movement speed
[1:32:21] <%ozmon> It's way back there
[1:32:29] <+Javaa01> Dashing is much better in combat
[1:32:34] <mdkcde> Remember to check the rooms
[1:32:41] <mdkcde> it glows
[1:32:42] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:32:47] <+Javaa01> You can crank down the saturation
[1:33:14] <+Donchalant402> ^
[1:33:23] <Equirah> statue near the exit
[1:33:28] <+Donchalant402> saturation is too high by default
[1:33:31] <kulmoth> for some reason seeing controller fps movement makes me anxious
[1:33:42] <%GeneralSCPatton> Remember to always leave half the room unsurveyed and never look around until you are flanked.
[1:33:47] <%RioGascar> Im not sure i even get what they are going for with the high saturation
[1:34:02] <letshavecakes> That E1M1 melody
[1:34:21] <+Donchalant402> @RioGascar I get it, but if you can lower it and still get the same effect
[1:34:24] <+Donchalant402> its a bit TOO high
[1:34:24] <%ozmon> Hey a statue
[1:34:39] <%RioGascar> Okay you get it, but i dont get it
[1:34:46] <%RioGascar> explain why its high contrast
[1:34:50] <%justmildlilac> @letshavecakes YO THE LEITMOTIF
[1:34:54] <%RioGascar> *saturation
[1:34:58] <%justmildlilac> I didn't notice until now
[1:35:20] <+Donchalant402> @RioGascar ive played the game, when you lower it down the visual flare is still there, its just less eye searing
[1:35:43] <+Donchalant402> there are rooms where the default saturation flat out looks bad
[1:35:45] <%RioGascar> Okay so no clue WHY its high saturation then
[1:35:52] <mdkcde> you got keys for the chest
[1:35:53] <+Donchalant402> its the visual style
[1:36:12] <+Donchalant402> you still get the style when you lower it a bit
[1:36:17] <alphalejandro> vibin birb
[1:36:23] <+Javaa01> Minigun gets you 16ths
[1:36:29] <+i_heart_gaming> This is the reddest game I have ever seen
[1:36:35] <wibbwobbler> quarter note? so cool man
[1:36:48] <+Javaa01> Juke is an instruction to dodge
[1:36:49] <%justmildlilac> It's a juke bonus
[1:37:02] <+i_heart_gaming> The gun sounds like its part of the music
[1:37:08] <%mikesapartment> dodge when you're about to get hit
[1:37:09] <+Donchalant402> thats the point yeah
[1:37:15] <+D00msDayDan> does the dash have iframes?
[1:37:21] <+Donchalant402> when playing right its all just music
[1:37:39] <%dots4eyes> Oh no...
[1:37:51] <%justmildlilac> Like how it said "DODGE" when you dashed away just in time @WoolieVersus
[1:38:01] <%RioGascar> Okay but i want to know WHY they choose high saturation for the art style. They had to have a reason
[1:38:06] <+Javaa01> Two handed weapons can be shot only on full beat, but reload actions can happen on half beat
[1:38:15] <andrewofbob> I’d say dashing doesn’t. We’ve seen Woolie dash through enemies and pay blood.
[1:38:24] <+Donchalant402> chest room?
[1:38:26] <%RioGascar> its probably something in the music community or some kinda inspired by rhythm games
[1:38:32] <%RioGascar> But idk
[1:39:13] <%fozzle_> fozzle_ subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:39:15] <+D00msDayDan> or maybe it's just bad art direction
[1:39:24] <+Donchalant402> the chest is gone already
[1:39:27] <DSD24> Or maybe its a budget thing
[1:39:30] <mdkcde> YOU WILL DIE REGGEI
[1:39:33] <%justmildlilac> Shield is like a blue heart in Issac
[1:39:35] <+Javaa01> This is a challenge room for rewards, you will probably die if you try this
[1:39:37] <mdkcde> YOU can;t
[1:39:44] <+Donchalant402> in these rooms you need to fight 3 waves of enemies to get all the rewards
[1:39:45] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:39:49] <FrootusClopootus> The devs seen what hell looks like and it just hurts your eyes
[1:39:54] <+b_aleph> That's what she said
[1:39:55] <DSD24> Can you smell!?
[1:40:02] <%Solidnick18> if ya smellllllll
[1:40:02] <alphalejandro> CAN YOU SMELL?!
[1:40:09] <+Donchalant402> you get a chest with each wave, the final chest being the best reward
[1:40:10] <+Ez3z> they made this game on a budget so they used a lot of purchasable assets. the lighting is just to unify all the assets
[1:40:36] <mdkcde> the challenges are hard
[1:40:37] <letshavecakes> Why would you ever stop moving
[1:40:39] <nintega010> ahhh
[1:40:41] <alphalejandro> Killed by Fly
[1:40:44] <wibbwobbler> gg
[1:40:47] <mdkcde> not reccomended for starters
[1:40:48] <DianaTheAscian> never stop moving it seems
[1:40:49] <%FuqBoiSlim> FLY OMEGALUL
[1:40:53] <%Solidnick18> chugsGG
[1:40:56] <FrootusClopootus> shot by a fly by
[1:40:56] <mdkcde> and the rewards are NOT worth it
[1:40:57] <$silentblast93> like being killed by a slime
[1:41:09] <JustYudha> Stand Still = Death
[1:41:09] <%dots4eyes> Killed by fly IRL would suck
[1:41:10] <%RioGascar> @ez3z That actually makes a lot of sense
[1:41:13] <nintega010> Oh man it's one of those games where you die and start over
[1:41:21] <%mitchteck> Alaways be shmovimg
[1:41:23] <Equirah> Reggie doesn't have object permanence LUL
[1:41:24] <letshavecakes> Being in a corner is irrelevant when the enemies can shoot bullets at you from range
[1:41:35] <JonnyJug> The challenge rooms are only worth it if you do 3 rounds
[1:41:37] <+Javaa01> This game was made by like less then half a dozen people
[1:42:00] <+Donchalant402> challenge rooms are something you dont touch unless you got a good build going
[1:42:20] <+Donchalant402> crit time
[1:42:22] <alphalejandro> Guts arm
[1:42:29] <EternalJedi> SourPls
[1:42:33] <wibbwobbler> gatsu
[1:42:36] <+Javaa01> But the rewards for doing the challenges are really good, as long as you can live through all 3 waves
[1:42:39] <JustYudha> Idk if I like the red filter. Can you change the color in game like Downwell or World of Horror?
[1:42:41] <lazerscraper> gatz
[1:42:46] <sleepy_pink> psssh, pointing
[1:42:47] <+YabbaTroll> i mean thats the strat
[1:42:48] <EternalJedi> strafe to aim is completely valid
[1:43:01] <BlackermanZX> strafe to aim is perfectly valid
[1:43:02] <+YabbaTroll> Woolie already knows the meta
[1:43:11] <0rond> I mean, on controller there's no real difference which joystick to move
[1:43:24] <0rond> aiming and moving are nearly the same
[1:43:33] <alphalejandro> kill goldbat
[1:43:50] <+Donchalant402> @JustYudha the problem with the saturation is when you get too close to certain objects and it freaks out
[1:43:55] <+Javaa01> "Too Far" only shows up if your crosshair was on target
[1:43:56] <+Fattness132> 'Too Far shows up when you're on target but out of range - it doesnt show anything when you miss
[1:44:03] <+Donchalant402> if you stand right next to hugin on default satuation it goes crazy
[1:44:19] <letshavecakes> An artificial range stat is probably the worst way possible to handle balancing gun shoots
[1:44:40] <EternalJedi> the8bitSellout
[1:44:42] <+Donchalant402> @letshavecakes there is a range stat
[1:44:56] <letshavecakes> @Donchalant402 Yes?
[1:45:18] <+Donchalant402> after a couple levels thats typically not a problem anymore
[1:45:48] <+Pop_O_Matic> Why is there a chocobo in this shootbang game?
[1:45:54] <EternalJedi> KEWH
[1:45:55] <0rond> why wouldn't there be
[1:45:57] <EternalJedi> *KWEH
[1:45:58] <DSD24> @Pop_O_Matic cause he is cute

[1:48:40] <letshavecakes> Probably best to start early, since Ultrakill has a solid 4-6 hours of content, and Woolie needs to see all of it
[1:48:40] <FrootusClopootus> the game feels like it either makes you god mode or a weak struggle
[1:48:42] <emeraldskrull> Fuck the cube. Fuck pat.

[1:49:48] <letshavecakes> Can't remap buttons or change stick sensitivity, but it works
[1:50:01] <+Ez3z> not using k/b for fps will always mean playing suboptimally, but thats fine if you're not trying to play optimally its cool to play just for funsies

[1:52:52] <Johannen> Myself mix up gamepad and mouse on Apex, got 3 full squad wipe solo on gamepad..it jsut takes practice as everything
[1:52:54] <EternalJedi> fall forward, try to catch yourself, fall back, slap the ground as you land
[1:52:55] <Darkdrill> Weir a helmet

[1:54:43] <EternalJedi> falling back and slapping the ground is how they teach you to fall in Karate and such

[2:01:21] <%justmildlilac> Razer Kraken is pretty solid
[2:01:26] <Broand> If you go separate you get better value for money
[2:01:29] <huskarl_zap> @desertpenguin No its a woolie joke
[2:01:30] <%Typhaeon> Are you getting a sound card?
[2:01:32] <+YabbaTroll> yo corsair cases are great tho
[2:01:33] <+Bail_seven> CORSAIR Virtuoso where it at
[2:01:37] <+YabbaTroll> you need wireless?
[2:01:44] <Darkdrill> ask woollie what would work
[2:01:47] <@akuda_bar> soundcards are useless unless you're crazy
[2:01:50] <letshavecakes> Get an Xbox 360 headset and figure it out
[2:01:50] <%Typhaeon> It's not really obsolete, more specialist
[2:01:54] <+Pop_O_Matic> Yeah, I have sennheisers and they're really good.
[2:01:59] <+Javaa01> Yeah you don't need an audio card in the current year unless you make music
[2:02:06] <Broand> Sennheisers are good quality
[2:02:08] <huskarl_zap> sound cards are not needed.
[2:02:14] <+DesertPenguin> Sennheiser is amazing
[2:02:17] <+DesertPenguin> Turtle Beach is great too
[2:02:19] <%Typhaeon> I use an EVGA Nu-Audio as a line in for my XLR mic
[2:02:20] <@akuda_bar> you could be one of those nuts who hang crystals around their room to improve the audio waves but i hope you're not that nuts
[2:02:21] <+Javaa01> Turtle Beach is pretty cheap tho
[2:02:23] <+DesertPenguin> Shure is good
[2:02:25] <+rj1771> Turtle Beach is always quality.
[2:02:27] <%Mr_Strut> Insight gained
[2:02:33] <+DesertPenguin> A HOLE
[2:02:37] <he1lhydra> reggie found the hole c805Pog
[2:02:38] <ZeeJiggle> "Ohh, there's a hole here!" -Reggie 2020
[2:02:49] <%fozzle_> my old turtle beach x11s lasted me a good 6 years
[2:02:52] <Darkdrill> PogChamp hole found
[2:02:57] <+DesertPenguin> I've got Turtle Beach Stealth 700 for PS4
[2:02:59] <ikantreeed> Is the stream over?
[2:03:00] <wibbwobbler> depends on how much ur willing to spend
[2:03:08] <Broand> I know a promo code if you wanna get some raycons though psaLiz
[2:03:32] <+Javaa01> @WoolieVersus If you want a better mic, you can always also get a ModMic, that's a headset mounted mic that's far better then the stuff that comes with headsets
[2:03:36] <%Typhaeon> Sennheiser's have decent noise cancelling mics on the G4ME series
[2:03:46] <G03933> dont wanna over do it like skate boarding
[2:03:52] <+rj1771> It's all in the hips! barbToxic
[2:03:53] <Darkdrill> woolie advice is the perfect guide
[2:03:53] <huskarl_zap> lo
[2:04:20] <+xKING_IRA> Arctis from steel series is great and comes with software that EQs the mic
[2:04:29] <+DesertPenguin> As long as they have mic monitoring so you hear yourself in your own ears. I always tend to speak louder with headphones on and that really helps
[2:04:49] <Darkdrill> Yoo Woolies course for live 👌 spitting fact's
[2:05:09] <@akuda_bar> learning shit is fun
[2:05:22] <@akuda_bar> that sounded deeper in my head
[2:05:58] <%Solidnick18> i think i remember that
[2:06:12] <+rj1771> I don't like chaaaaange! feenR
[2:06:15] <@akuda_bar> wasnt that the episode liam kept making lip sounds
[2:06:28] <%Mr_Strut> Why can't we just lock the entire world in stasis?
[2:06:30] <Darkdrill> yeah it's different and different makes me mad 😤
[2:07:04] <%Javaa01> Buying too cheap is a quick way to waste an insane amount of money
[2:07:10] <%Puhff> dude i can'thear a thing
[2:07:57] <+xKING_IRA> that's why I went full send and invested on a Elgato Wave 3
[2:08:13] <+r_squared1672> @WoolieVersus What's that Grey Fox and where can I get one?
[2:08:13] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:08:16] <%Mr_Strut> I'm excited for reggie streams
[2:08:26] <letshavecakes> We're not gonna make it past the prelude, are we
[2:08:29] <Mnemonicjohnny> And here we fucking go

[2:09:33] <Broand> Oh yeah this is a one on dunski
[2:09:33] <@Squdnate> It's that packed
[2:09:41] <%sleepofgiants> sleepofgiants is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to WoolieVersus's community! They've gifted a total of 1 in the channel! 
[2:09:42] <%sleepofgiants> sleepofgiants is paying forward the Gift they got from Maloane to the community!

[2:10:57] <Broand> We're good
[2:10:59] <+r_squared1672> Tekken 7 is too solidf
[2:11:00] <%justmildlilac> You manually turn it on

[2:17:48] <nutimik> Auto aim is NEEDED for controller
[2:17:49] <andrewofbob> Mouse sensitivity
[2:17:53] <ZeeJiggle> Could it be tied to mouse sens?

[2:19:48] <+500_pts> dont worry im also here to make fun of woolie @hakita
[2:19:50] <hakita> if you're gonna use controller i heavily suggest going to Assist Options and turning on Auto Aim, that's designed for controller players
[2:19:50] <townzzzzz> see if you can slide shoot/punch
[2:19:57] <jubejube56> Why gun when you can blood though?
[2:19:59] <+Bailey__gaming> @hakita thanks for the amazing game
[2:20:01] <+zed11111111> color up

[2:20:30] <doomslayerdt> wait a minute, why isnt woolie playing with his frankenstein controller? did it just become a joke, or does he just not use it that often
[2:20:30] <+MisterAvry> wow

[2:20:40] <+rottingpastry> Ooo look crushers let me get a closer look

[2:21:08] <letshavecakes> Broken button?
[2:21:08] <+MisterAvry> is that a punch?
[2:21:15] <alephalpha> AUTO AIM IS WAY TOO MUCH
[2:21:21] <alephalpha> it will actually lock on
[2:21:27] <+MisterAvry> it's more a weird snatch move
[2:21:46] <nutimik> Without auto aim it's literally impossible
[2:21:46] <%Mr_Strut> Niddhog mode
[2:21:49] <letshavecakes> That's hilarious
[2:21:57] <Manwad> he's gonna need a lock on if he's on controller
[2:22:04] <%Typhaeon> Game audio is low
[2:22:05] <alephalpha> I've p ranked the game without auto aim
[2:22:06] <FeltSn0wman> outline only works great btw
[2:22:06] <nutimik> you can have only the outline without the whole silhouette, it's useful
[2:22:09] <letshavecakes> Imagine actually not being able to aim without autoaim
[2:22:09] <+smevvster> Good luck using the coin on controller without autoaim lmao
[2:22:10] <+DesertPenguin> Need more enemies for higher style
[2:22:11] <%Javaa01> Or do shoot the floor
[2:22:15] <alephalpha> you should eb playing with keyboard and mous ehtough

[2:22:49] <myfaceisapotato> dude I love guns that rumble like a ps2 controller when they get hyped up
[2:22:55] <+nekodelic> please tell me you can taunt
[2:22:59] <alephalpha> notice how the giun is litereally tilting liek 70 degrees to lock on
[2:23:01] <Manwad> wait can you not limb/headshot with autoaim on?
[2:23:03] <letshavecakes> That autoaim is more like autopilot, goddamn

[2:25:36] <%FuqBoiSlim> b OMEGALUL ss
[2:25:41] <%mikesapartment> punch his face in
[2:25:47] <UnfilteredComic> Dash has full invincibility frames btw
[2:25:47] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> I love how fast you can get back in after death
[2:25:50] <DSD24> Scary face
[2:25:55] <nutimik> succesful parries heal ALL your health
[2:25:55] <%Mr_Strut> I just realized the face has spider legs
[2:25:59] <JaseAdrift> woolie lacking in his punch abilities
[2:26:00] <letshavecakes> Charge shots are easier to land than regular
[2:26:01] <Kuubyy> you gotta jump up close and punch/shoot
[2:26:04] <mdkcde> try parrying his shots
[2:26:11] <%hakita> lol
[2:26:11] <DucksForBrains> punch the bullets
[2:26:13] <+Detectivemac9> noooooooo
[2:26:13] <+JRC_N> Pog
[2:26:13] <+epoladia> f
[2:26:16] <alephalpha> punch the bullets
[2:26:16] <+Spider1991> almost
[2:26:24] <%Mr_Strut> You gotta parry, woolie
[2:26:24] <BlackermanZX> LUL
[2:26:25] <alephalpha> it take sliek 2 secs to kill these enemsi
[2:26:25] <%ClericOfSparda> LUL
[2:26:34] <%Solidnick18> that is it
[2:26:39] <FerwhateverDota> it is
[2:26:46] <Mnemonicjohnny> @WoolieVersus Yo, Wool, you hear the *ping* when the beam fires? Try punching the face when that happens.
[2:26:47] <Sapphire_Breeze> it is worth it
[2:26:48] <%jetjagger222> DISMAL
[2:26:50] <FerwhateverDota> you get health back
[2:26:50] <DSD24> Spinning and Spinning
[2:26:53] <%mikesapartment> nope
[2:26:56] <Sapphire_Breeze> that spin
[2:26:56] <DianaTheAscian> no
[2:26:58] <%Javaa01> You need a different tool for effectively parrying that
[2:26:58] <alephalpha> you can reflec tit with acoin
[2:27:00] <FeltSn0wman> nope not the beam
[2:27:01] <%Solidnick18> idk can you
[2:27:02] <DianaTheAscian> u can't
[2:27:06] <alephalpha> uc an't
[2:27:08] <TungstenViper> coin
[2:27:09] <ashbirds> it's way easier on m/k
[2:27:10] <nutimik> You can parry red easily
[2:27:12] <alephalpha> but you can reflect it with acoin
[2:27:14] <andrewofbob> It was worth the trade.
[2:27:14] <DucksForBrains> You can punch anything and EVERYTHING.
[2:27:15] <%hakita> Beam's hitscan so you can't punch it but you can parry the charge up by punching the face after the flash but before the beam
[2:27:21] <%mitchteck> You can punch reds
[2:27:23] <%WinstonFromUndertale> Gets attacked and gains all his health back. “It’s not worth it”
[2:27:35] <alephalpha> @hakita yooooo
[2:27:47] <alephalpha> thanks for makign thisgame it rocks
[2:27:51] <SeshohoCian> if you hit him right when he's about shoot the beam he'll misfire and hurt himself
[2:27:51] <%mitchteck> Also you can get health by shooting close
[2:27:56] <%Mr_Strut> stary outta those corners
[2:28:02] <myfaceisapotato> only downside to punch parries might be the combo misses look even dumber than dark souls down flailing his shield around wildly.
[2:28:03] <%heartlesshealer> man, the boys are playing the Devil May Quake
[2:28:05] <%heartlesshealer> nice

[2:41:42] <pillygram> yumayaHYPE yumayaHYPE marksman pistooool yumayaHYPE yumayaHYPE
[2:41:42] <letshavecakes> You can swap
[2:41:42] <+ladomania> There's a perfect timing that breaks the bullet into 2
[2:41:43] <%justmildlilac> You can punch coins @WoolieVersus
[2:41:43] <FeltSn0wman> also u get both
[2:41:43] <Louie_Salmon> You can still swap
[2:41:43] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you can switch tho
[2:41:43] <nutimik> Some other guns can also reflect off the coin
[2:41:44] <DetroitSentai> you can swap at any time
[2:41:44] <%Javaa01> You can just switch back instantly
[2:41:46] <+500_pts> you can swap back to charge shot
[2:41:46] <Broand> You can swap between guns, try buttons
[2:41:48] <+rottingpastry> punch coin
[2:41:49] <%Slimshazbot> @WoolieVersus You stil have the charge shot, sqap guns
[2:41:52] <+OneGorillionDollars> you can punch a bullet INTO the coin
[2:41:53] <TairinSoulgem> Woolsworth best protag
[2:42:03] <%Javaa01> That's a thing
[2:42:03] <Broand> It is a thing
[2:42:04] <alephalpha> YES YOU CAN PUNCH COIN
[2:42:04] <DianaTheAscian> no woolie
[2:42:04] <Sapphire_Breeze> it IS a thing
[2:42:04] <+smevvster> It's totally a thing.
[2:42:06] <%justmildlilac> You can
[2:42:07] <nutimik> You CAN punch coins
[2:42:09] <Mnemonicjohnny> Oh, it *is*, Wool
[2:42:15] <+skylerpilot> @WoolieVersus you're not trading, you can swap between them right now and use the other gun while coin is on CD
[2:42:16] <nutimik> hard to do though
[2:42:17] <FeltSn0wman> walk backwards as you throw @WoolieVersus
[2:42:18] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @WoolieVersus you can switch modes on the gun
[2:42:19] <+YabbaTroll> juggle that coin
[2:42:23] <+Spider1991> booom
[2:42:23] <EternalJedi> ahhhhh
[2:42:24] <Div_the_Penguin> PogChamp
[2:42:27] <%heartlesshealer> Woolie, Punch interacts with all projectiles, but does Coin?
[2:42:29] <Broand> Fistful of dollars
[2:42:29] <alephalpha> punch coins can be huggled
[2:42:29] <Railgun5> @WoolieVersus There's a button to swap gun modes it's E on the keyboard
[2:42:30] <%Javaa01> Absolutely not
[2:42:31] <DianaTheAscian> oh thats what he was doing
[2:42:33] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Not moving your aim is a key to hitting coins even while moving
[2:42:33] <Louie_Salmon> It JUGGLES the coin too
[2:42:36] <alephalpha> coins can also reflect lasers
[2:42:38] <Broand> You can swap out for charge shot tho
[2:42:38] <Doobinn> @hakita this is the best game ever made atpGasm
[2:42:41] <ashbirds> yeah dunno how you change weapons on controller
[2:42:42] <DetroitSentai> you can swap at any time
[2:42:48] <%mitchteck> You can hotswap into charge shoy
[2:42:49] <letshavecakes> Autoaim can't into coin
[2:42:50] <%Slimshazbot> @WoolieVersus You CAN switch between the coin and charge shot, also you get a temporary score multiplier for fresh weapon swaps
[2:42:54] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @T_Sasquatch
[2:42:55] <alephalpha> AUTOAIM CAN'T CONI
[2:42:55] <gryffinp> I think a tutorial popup about mode switch shows up soon after you get the gun but then again considering that he got it on the third level and after doing the first room who fucking knows
[2:43:03] <alephalpha> it'll track toe nemis
[2:43:08] <FeltSn0wman> is M+KB just not an option?
[2:43:20] <Div_the_Penguin> it is he just prefers controller
[2:43:28] <alephalpha> turn auto aim off
[2:43:29] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:43:31] <gryffinp> Woolie is trying to do combos on Easy Operation mode.
[2:43:37] <+Superspider51> will this be the game to finally get woolie to convert?
[2:43:37] <letshavecakes> It is genuinely easier to play on controller without it
[2:43:38] <nutimik> probably would've been kinda OP otherwise
[2:43:39] <DSD24> @FeltSn0wman Its the main option
[2:43:45] <alephalpha> stop playing in stylish mode woolie
[2:43:50] <%Slimshazbot> @alephalpha Auto-aim off on a controler is a baaad idea
[2:43:51] <DucksForBrains> @WoolieVersus it will change the coins direction when thrown just a little bit every time to keep you on guard.
[2:43:52] <+YabbaTroll> well thats sus
[2:43:54] <%Javaa01> Need bigger gun
[2:43:56] <%cobalt_phoenix_> need more gun
[2:43:59] <EternalJedi> need more gun
[2:44:00] <DianaTheAscian> bigger gun
[2:44:02] <Manwad> against enemies.
[2:44:05] <Broand> Try jumping after slamming
[2:44:09] <+skylerpilot> jump after the ground pound
[2:44:12] <%Javaa01> Slam flings enemies into the air
[2:44:14] <Div_the_Penguin> it is time
[2:44:14] <Sapphire_Breeze> ok here we go
[2:44:16] <T_Sasquatch> im a console player but this on a controller just seems way worse
[2:44:20] <%Mr_Strut> Hi Virgil
[2:44:21] <Louie_Salmon> It just looks silly when they fly, that's all
[2:44:22] <rowboat_girlyman> so he gave up on BPM?
[2:44:27] <alephalpha> @Slimshazbot I play with cotnroller cause I have issues with spreading and stretching my hands across key's it's totally doable obviously not as good a smouse though
[2:44:28] <%Solidnick18> aye
[2:44:36] <DianaTheAscian> u can change guns btw
[2:44:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you can switch
[2:44:42] <nutimik> You can swap guns
[2:44:42] <townzzzzz> SHCUM
[2:44:43] <Louie_Salmon> You can still switch to charge
[2:44:43] <Div_the_Penguin> he has only one so far
[2:44:43] <DetroitSentai> theres a swap button woolie
[2:44:44] <Broand> There's a button that swaps weapons
[2:44:52] <+Lolo27234> got your zero wollie

[2:45:51] <%Rambs_> Punch your shot!
[2:45:52] <DetroitSentai> punch shotgun
[2:45:55] <T_Sasquatch> @ianabstract that's the coolest thing I've read in weeks
[2:45:56] <alephalpha> punch your normal shotgun fire
[2:45:57] <$J0RD4NPR1M3> you can punch the bomb
[2:45:57] <Div_the_Penguin> but does it reflect from coins
[2:45:57] <Sapphire_Breeze> punch shotgun
[2:45:59] <letshavecakes> Shotgun tech is genuinely gamebreaking
[2:46:03] <+Superspider51> punch the bullets

[2:47:30] <%Javaa01> All blood is healing
[2:47:34] <+ianabstract> you gotta get blood on you for healing

[2:47:36] <letshavecakes> Punches don't heal, blood does
[2:47:36] <%hakita> Self-parries dont heal as of 1.03 cause it was too OP
[2:47:38] <+zed11111111> THIS is a fucking shotgun
[2:47:38] <+smevvster> Woolie seems to be convinced that "punching" is healing, when it's just any close range damage.
[2:47:39] <+Lolo27234> yes if your willing to face fuck everything
[2:47:43] <+skylerpilot> Punch doesn't heal woolie, being close enough to get covered in blood is healing
[2:47:44] <Broand> Any shots that are close range heal
[2:47:45] <+OroOreo> hes got it
[2:47:46] <gryffinp> The shotgun projectile boost does NOT full heal. (it used to when it was a genuine bug but that was nerfed because that would be too nuts)

[2:48:00] <%Mr_Strut> Shotgun ntr
[2:48:03] <DetroitSentai> Woolie/Reggie it's not the punch that heals, its being near an enemy when they bleed. Shooting next to an enemy heals
[2:48:04] <%RyTYoung> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[2:48:04] <@Menitta> I thought you'd like punch the shells and they'd count as shots but THATS WAY COOLER

[2:48:06] <Louie_Salmon> Meathook is still pretty rad though!

[2:48:11] <alephalpha> BLOOD IS FUEL
[2:48:20] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Close-Ranged engagement heals cause of blood not cause of the punch. Dont focus on the punching
[2:48:21] <+skylerpilot> BLOOD is healing not punch
[2:48:24] <gryffinp> @DetroitSentai What they're confusing it with is that punching an enemy shot to parry it DOES full heal
[2:48:25] <%Akizea> thats so fucking cool holy shit yo
[2:48:25] <+Superspider51> Blood is health
[2:48:25] <+RahkshiLord> you can heal with any close range damage, not just punching woolie

[2:51:56] <ashbirds> i want that sword so fucking bad dude
[2:52:00] <Broand> He needs blood to live
[2:52:01] <%hakita> Machines have blood because BLOOD IS FUEL
[2:52:01] <nutimik> YOU are a machine woolie
[2:52:02] <+smevvster> Blood is fuel, and even machines need fuel.
[2:52:03] <gryffinp> ...what do you think YOUR charactger is doing with all of the blood
[2:52:07] <Louie_Salmon> BLOOD IS FUEL
[2:52:07] <%Animatic_> you're also full of blood, woolie

[2:52:57] <%Mr_Strut> This shotgun was made for woolie
[2:52:58] <@Menitta> PARRIES
[2:53:01] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[2:53:01] <letshavecakes> The shotgun tech is nearly endless, other guns can't even compete
[2:53:04] <DSD24> Or eyes have yet to open

[2:53:13] <DucksForBrains> Royal Gun
[2:53:15] <%mikesapartment> order her a buckshot
[2:53:24] <gryffinp> Shotgun Parry is SUPER good against swordsmachine so it's a little awkward that you just killed him. And no, you're not about to fight him again any time soon, I'm not making a joke.
[2:53:29] <+Lolo27234> go into shootguns bed room
[2:53:30] <@akuda_bar> when the moon hits your eyes...

[2:53:40] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yeah pretty much
[2:53:55] <UnfilteredComic> Yep
[2:53:56] <nutimik> Gun variations
[2:53:56] <DeathByPoke7> yes
[2:53:57] <Louie_Salmon> Yes
[2:54:03] <+zed11111111> they got the colors right too
[2:54:09] <%Slimshazbot> @woolieversus you have all unlocks at all times, use them all
[2:54:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> think of it like weapon mods in doom
[2:54:12] <gryffinp> I really like pump charge
[2:54:13] <+lovedartss> woolie joining the Shotgun's onlyfans
[2:54:16] <gryffinp> Way more than core eject
[2:54:16] <Div_the_Penguin> you can unequip it if you don't plan to use it
[2:54:18] <EternalJedi> SUPER SOAKER SHOTGUN
[2:54:19] <UnfilteredComic> very few of them are straight upgrades, and some styles can combo with others
[2:54:25] <FeltSn0wman> its big
[2:54:27] <+skylerpilot> its a super jump
[2:54:27] <+Spider1991> you have dash tho
[2:54:27] <%Solidnick18> idk
[2:54:28] <DetroitSentai> Its tech
[2:54:30] <Louie_Salmon> Woolie wants to pump this shotgun all day
[2:54:31] <nutimik> Most of the time
[2:54:35] <%Javaa01> It will damage you, but it can be used for BIG style
[2:54:36] <letshavecakes> That's the shotgun with big dick energy
[2:54:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> Check upgrades?
[2:54:40] <+zed11111111> can you "style switch"?
[2:54:46] <+Lolo27234> it can be a bad thing if you dont have the style for it
[2:54:48] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[2:54:55] <DetroitSentai> you can dash it
[2:54:57] <DucksForBrains> you gotta go in with that one
[2:54:57] <+smevvster> Remember your dash has i-frames :^)
[2:54:58] <%Rambs_> You can dash to avoid the max explosion
[2:54:58] <EternalJedi> FINAL FLAAAAAASH
[2:54:59] <letshavecakes> It can also be used to rocket jump
[2:54:59] <UnfilteredComic> Can I frame through it i think
[2:54:59] <Sapphire_Breeze> LUL
[2:55:03] <%Solidnick18> hahaha
[2:55:06] <+Spider1991> but you dash tho
[2:55:06] <Charronia> rooSlain
[2:55:06] <Louie_Salmon> Good to know
[2:55:09] <+Superspider51> you can dodge the explosion and punch the charged bullets
[2:55:10] <%mikesapartment> you can dodge it with dash
[2:55:10] <+skylerpilot> @woolie swap shotguns to avoid reload
[2:55:10] <%justmildlilac> You can dash out of the explosion @WoolieVersus
[2:55:11] <DSD24> But if you are that close
[2:55:11] <nutimik> You can dash through the explosion
[2:55:12] <Broand> If you're cose you get blood from it
[2:55:13] <+ghostfaceninja_> moms spagetti
[2:55:15] <DianaTheAscian> @WoolieVersus only damage if your close
[2:55:17] <ashbirds> dash has i-frames baby
[2:55:19] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @alephalpha
[2:55:24] <Louie_Salmon> Oh right, I forgot the Dodge tech on this

[2:56:17] <@akuda_bar> is this hell or heaven
[2:56:18] <nutimik> There's a weapon switch, mode switch, and "last used weapon"
[2:56:22] <DucksForBrains> The juice is real
[2:56:23] <Sapphire_Breeze> you died and have to buy it again?
[2:56:24] <+skylerpilot> no
[2:56:24] <DetroitSentai> no
[2:56:25] <letshavecakes> Did he forget the button already
[2:56:28] <%Mr_Strut> Controls?
[2:56:29] <+skylerpilot> there is a style change button
[2:56:29] <Louie_Salmon> Nah it's a different button for types
[2:56:31] <gryffinp> There was a thread on the subreddit earlier today reading "Most interesting types of guns in gaming" and there are three different top level comments naming Ultrakill and each one is about a DIFFERENT gun
[2:56:32] <%justmildlilac> There's a button
[2:56:33] <DetroitSentai> There is a button to cycle it
[2:56:34] <letshavecakes> Press Y
[2:56:35] <%hakita> There's a switch variations button
[2:56:35] <+smevvster> What's the controller button?
[2:56:41] <+Superspider51> different button
[2:56:42] <%Solidnick18> so dash
[2:56:45] <%Animatic_> it's a different button for variations
[2:56:45] <DeathByPoke7> hold y maybe
[2:56:45] <nutimik> Hold weapon switch and you get a weapon wheel normally
[2:56:49] <+zed11111111> so you CAN "style switch"
[2:56:50] <+Lolo27234> you can switch on the fly
[2:56:51] <%DashXero> I can come back later....
[2:56:53] <T_Sasquatch> Why
[2:56:57] <letshavecakes> Kinda clunky
[2:57:16] <%mixedelirium> I wonder if this would work with Woolie's goofy Mouse + Controller scheme
[2:57:20] <%justmildlilac> Backdash
[2:57:23] <%hakita> Backdash and immediately shoot
[2:57:27] <DucksForBrains> you can shoot while dashing i believe
[2:57:28] <tux_3do> wouldnt you dash backwards? away from the explosion?
[2:57:31] <gryffinp> This is somewhat advanced tech
[2:57:32] <+zed11111111> did it
[2:57:32] <%justmildlilac> Backdash then shoot

[2:58:05] <+skylerpilot> its also a super jump if you have the HP and want to get through some areas faster

[2:58:29] <%Solidnick18> That's godlike
[2:58:30] <%SilverRoddo> The forward down
[2:58:30] <gryffinp> @letshavecakes ...well except for when you get into switch cancelling
[2:58:32] <Broand> It has zero range
[2:58:34] <+zed11111111> this fucking SHOTGUN
[2:58:39] <%Solidnick18> OOH
[2:58:46] <Sapphire_Breeze> And Vergil said that guns are lame
[2:58:51] <+RenoDeGeneric> This game is too hype for moobot to ban caps
[2:58:56] <%justmildlilac> Rocket jump confirmed?
[2:58:59] <shotgang86> its bluuuud
[2:59:03] <+Lolo27234> woolie you can punch a chraged shot
[2:59:07] <%justmildlilac> With max charge
[2:59:10] <T_Sasquatch> Am i crazy or is there auto aim in this
[2:59:19] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> Parry that shot
[2:59:25] <+zed11111111> wait can you really punch the charge shot?
[2:59:29] <+OroOreo> so sick
[2:59:30] <+ianabstract> so Meaty
[2:59:31] <Louie_Salmon> YEh
[2:59:33] <shotgang86> wait this has a STYLE METER?
[2:59:33] <%Mr_Strut> And you doubted the coin
[2:59:33] <%Solidnick18> PogChamp
[2:59:34] <+Spider1991> go them
[2:59:37] <+RenoDeGeneric> There's hella auto aim, but this game absolutely wouldn't work at all without auto aim on controller
[2:59:38] <%justmildlilac> @WoolieVersus You can rocket jump with max charge shot
[2:59:51] <andrewofbob> Autoaim is switched on, and it denies tech
[2:59:51] <T_Sasquatch> @alephalpha ahh i noticed the cursor
[3:00:04] <+redux_014> Is this early access?
[3:00:05] <lazerscraper> you can charge shot the coins
[3:00:06] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus The laser can also be parried with a coin thrown directly at the face
[3:00:09] <+skylerpilot> swap between shotguns to avoid the reload animation
[3:00:10] <gryffinp> woolie it's a SHOTGUN. you gotta get UP to him
[3:00:10] <+ianabstract> getting right under the face with a shotgun is a good way to heal
[3:00:12] <ZeeJiggle> I love that every shotgun shot is an attempt to parry it.
[3:00:19] <+xiccy> What happened to BPM?
[3:00:30] <%mixedelirium> Better BPM
[3:00:31] <%hakita> Malicious Faces are invulnerable to explosions so I wouldn't advise using those on them
[3:00:32] <nutimik> You can go higher than SSS
[3:00:33] <lazerscraper> bpm done
[3:00:34] <+AnonymousNumbers> Malicious Faces are resistant to explosion damage btw
[3:00:34] <leomuratore> I'm remembering of DmC's announced saying ANARCHIC
[3:00:38] <+ianabstract> one shot!
[3:00:39] <+zed11111111> that head got obliteated
[3:00:40] <+nekodelic> ULTRAKILL
[3:00:42] <letshavecakes> BPM is a side piece now
[3:00:43] <Sapphire_Breeze> LUL
[3:00:44] <Louie_Salmon> ULTRAKILL, He got it for just a second
[3:00:45] <+smevvster> Super advanced tech: If the malicious face's laser hits the coin, it'll deflect the laser shot back at the face.
[3:00:46] <ZeeJiggle> We're down too
[3:00:46] <%Mr_Strut> lol
[3:00:50] <+Spider1991> ULTRAKILL
[3:00:52] <gryffinp> Woolie it's still a shotgun!
[3:00:54] <%Rambs_> that split second ULTRAKILL tho
[3:01:00] <%justmildlilac> You can parry laser with the coin
[3:01:02] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> Keep switching for that new weapon bonus
[3:01:07] <Broand> The face can get twoshot from close range shotgun
[3:01:13] <DucksForBrains> A crumb of ultrakill
[3:01:16] <Div_the_Penguin> I'm just gonna say that he didn't even complete the free demo that's on steam
[3:01:28] <ashbirds> slide is really good for dodging without spending stamina. it doesn't have iframes but you move fast as hell
[3:01:29] <Div_the_Penguin> as in for how far he is
[3:01:36] <2pac_2furious> woolie, you can get blood from close range shots!!
[3:01:46] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @alephalpha
[3:01:49] <Broand> You keep punching for blood, but you get blood from every weapon close range
[3:02:01] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Close-ranged blood heals with any damage not jsut Punch
[3:02:11] <Sapphire_Breeze> LUL
[3:02:12] <tux_3do> is this a roguelike or are there checkpoints?
[3:02:16] <%Mr_Strut> yes
[3:02:20] <+OroOreo> they're checkpoints
[3:02:21] <+smevvster> It's not a roguelike.
[3:02:22] <+zed11111111> like the spelunky goblet
[3:02:29] <+skylerpilot> @tux_3do its designed levels
[3:02:33] <gryffinp> @tux_3do This is the first room of level 4, not a roguellike at all
[3:02:39] <FeltSn0wman> literally anything at close range gives healing
[3:02:41] <tux_3do> ok thank you chat
[3:02:48] <nutimik> shotgun gives massive heals
[3:02:50] <tux_3do> that would be insane if it was a roguelike
[3:02:55] <%justmildlilac> You can parry the laser with the coin
[3:02:55] <letshavecakes> I would almost suggest turning off the autoaim if woolie wasn't a grandma when it comes to controller aiming in the first place
[3:02:59] <FeltSn0wman> thats what the endless mode is for
[3:03:08] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> As long as blood touches you you’re good
[3:03:13] <gryffinp> see the problem with chat telling woolie the cool shotgun tech is that now woolie refuses to use the shotgun as a SHOTGUN
[3:03:22] <letshavecakes> Yeah
[3:03:27] <FeltSn0wman> oh btw @WoolieVersus malicious faces are immune to explosions
[3:03:27] <DSD24> Overpump
[3:03:30] <%doomerskeletor13> oh boy here I go ripping and tearing again
[3:03:31] <%Javaa01> The shotgun is best used not as a shotgun
[3:03:38] <letshavecakes> He was better off at least using the first tech
[3:03:40] <+zed11111111> let him play!
[3:03:45] <alephalpha> shotgun is bets used by puncing normal fire tbh
[3:03:48] <gryffinp> That's not true at ALL, shotgun primary fire RIPS through enemies if you get point blank
[3:03:55] <+skylerpilot> i just want him to be aware of shot swapping
[3:04:17] <Broand> Isn't he only invulnerable to grenades?
[3:04:26] <+ianabstract> I love how quick it throws you back in
[3:04:41] <tux_3do> @ianabstract super meat boy energy
[3:04:41] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:04:43] <%hakita> Nah Malicious Faces take no damage from any explosions with very rare exceptions, this is to stop them from killing themselves with their beams
[3:04:48] <letshavecakes> Game would be basically unplayable if it had the load times of an average AAA game
[3:04:56] <Johannen> Woolie loves tech so much he forgets about normals ^_^
[3:05:01] <gryffinp> I could have sworn we saw woolie kill an MF with the explosion just now though
[3:05:12] <gryffinp> I know i'm arguing with the dev here but still
[3:05:16] <ashbirds> woolie: if you're not using the i-frames you should slide instead of dash. it'll make movement smoother
[3:05:31] <%hakita> What happened during the one-shot kill is the explosion redirected its projectiles back at it, instantly killing it with 3 projectiles from its own burst
[3:05:39] <+RahkshiLord> woolie you have to hit them
[3:05:41] <letshavecakes> sick
[3:05:41] <gryffinp> Fair enough
[3:05:46] <+skylerpilot> swap between shotguns after a shot avoids reload time
[3:06:02] <%Mr_Strut> Don't choke
[3:06:02] <T_Sasquatch> Play it your way woolz
[3:06:09] <ZeeJiggle> BIG FISTKILL
[3:06:09] <+Ryu_R> gotta love the move, adjust, shoot, adjust, move on a controller LUL
[3:06:12] <alephalpha> finalluy he aime dat the head
[3:06:17] <DSD24> Big Fist Kill!
[3:06:22] <%justmildlilac> IT SAID BIG FISTKILL
[3:06:30] <tux_3do> im seeing a lot of backseating. is woolz ok with that stuff in chat? not being rude just asking for his stance on it
[3:06:31] <Broand> If you want, you can unequip weapons at the shop
[3:06:34] <letshavecakes> Can't wait for woolie to see a real boss
[3:06:37] <nutimik> I love this hallway visually
[3:06:42] <nutimik> reminds me of Event Horizon
[3:06:45] <DSD24> We in there
[3:06:54] <%ReddM00NMusic> ReddM00NMusic is continuing the Gift Sub they got from Rosewater_444! 
[3:06:55] <%justmildlilac> BLOOD IS FUEL
[3:07:08] <+MidnightBurst12> the music fits the game really well
[3:07:21] <%Animatic_> he's getting faster
[3:07:26] <gryffinp> The music was (mostly) made entirely by the lead dev
[3:07:27] <%hakita> The ground slam shockwave (the one you get when you hold the slam button) will launch nearby enemies into the air
[3:07:30] <j3sharp> SHIT
[3:07:31] <DSD24> That was intense
[3:07:34] <+OroOreo> get chomped
[3:07:39] <Broand> Ground pounds deal damage on direct hit, but if you land near a dude they go flying upward
[3:07:40] <BenGarcia8995> Woolie go back to the hallway for secret boss fight
[3:07:50] <T_Sasquatch> It's not October yet !
[3:08:04] <Div_the_Penguin> he is starting to get it
[3:08:04] <%Mr_Strut> Ya think?
[3:08:07] <UnfilteredComic> You need 2 stamina to do the big shockwave slam
[3:08:13] <%justmildlilac> Go back to hallway for secret boss fight
[3:08:17] <Johannen> @WoolieVersus Ground Pound (hold down button) is a launcher
[3:08:18] <+smevvster> I can *see* Woolie getting faster.
[3:08:20] <letshavecakes> At least the parry explosions still go where you look, and not where the autoaim dictates
[3:08:29] <ashbirds> he is beginning to believe
[3:08:37] <Louie_Salmon> You also need to hold the slam button, not enough to just press it
[3:08:37] <+Taisuru> *Woolie Noises*
[3:08:44] <tux_3do> that was clutch as hell
[3:08:51] <+ianabstract> @smevvster he is downloading the tech
[3:09:01] <Louie_Salmon> Don't worry, it saves you
[3:09:26] <letshavecakes> Castle Super Ceast
[3:09:34] <Broand> Wha
[3:09:35] <TheAmazingClaytor> JUGGLE 'EM
[3:09:37] <Broand> Am I hakita ?
[3:09:41] <gasperbpuffn> Rocket LOWNCHA
[3:09:45] <Louie_Salmon> That's basically your launcher
[3:09:49] <Louie_Salmon> Indeed
[3:09:49] <alephalpha> yes
[3:09:52] <+OroOreo> that is true yes
[3:09:53] <gryffinp> @Broand Scroll up, hakita beat you to it
[3:09:54] <DucksForBrains> yes
[3:10:04] <Mnemonicjohnny> Superjump, yep
[3:10:09] <+skylerpilot> @WoolieVersus swap shotguns after a shot to avoid reload, fires shotguns much faster
[3:10:22] <+ianabstract> Explosion parries
[3:10:23] <Louie_Salmon> Really?
[3:10:32] <%mikesapartment> its megaman
[3:10:52] <BlackermanZX> Megaman ass wall cling
[3:11:01] <%justmildlilac> Use slide for traversal when you don't need the iframes, it saves stamina for when you need it @WoolieVersus
[3:11:01] <%Superbro64> We Megaman CROSS my friends
[3:11:02] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> So this game is just the best parts of all games in one
[3:11:07] <tux_3do> LUL
[3:11:15] <+b_aleph> Cyberpunk 2077 killer
[3:11:16] <+OroOreo> this game is so sick dude
[3:11:17] <nutimik> hahaa saw that coming, that got me the first time as well
[3:11:21] <%SirGO0SE> what now COD fans Kappa
[3:11:27] <ashbirds> this is one of the best games ever made and its not even done lol
[3:11:38] <+skylerpilot> ^^^^^^
[3:11:41] <EternalJedi> NYOOOOOM
[3:11:42] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:11:43] <@Moobot> Easy with the emojis @alephalpha
[3:11:52] <letshavecakes> It's the best one-third of a game ever made
[3:11:59] <alephalpha> yeah it really is
[3:12:05] <alephalpha> by
[3:12:09] <alephalpha> by the way
[3:12:11] <nutimik> Yeah, make moving around fun, and you got 60% of the game done
[3:12:15] <ZeeJiggle> Yeah this game seriously is a contender for one of my fav FPSs ever.
[3:12:16] <alephalpha> you could have pparied swordsmachiens melees
[3:12:18] <%FuqBoiSlim> wow I love video games
[3:12:26] <Johannen> Tried to tell Woolie you that this is proper CharacterActionFps on twitter while he played Doom Eternal
[3:12:28] <Aussie_Manny> i love goooooold
[3:12:28] <+OroOreo> here we go baby
[3:12:35] <+ianabstract> you were asking about the orb holders
[3:12:36] <DSD24> Ooooo
[3:12:39] <gryffinp> CERBERUS
[3:12:40] <BlackermanZX> oh shit
[3:12:43] <EternalJedi> limesD THE CHOZO STATUE
[3:12:48] <+ianabstract> time to fighte the OOORBS
[3:12:49] <RetroCop87> But he has only 1 head
[3:12:50] <DSD24> He isn't as cute as Hades Cerberus
[3:12:52] <%hakita> Take your bets, how many deaths
[3:12:56] <Aussie_Manny> 3
[3:12:58] <%justmildlilac> Is slide jumping for extra height/distance a thing? @hakita
[3:13:10] <alephalpha> 1 cerberus is actullay way easier the swordsmachien
[3:13:15] <RetroCop87> Oh, there we go
[3:13:17] <+RenoDeGeneric> AGNI AND RUDRA
[3:13:20] <%hakita> Slide jumping does give you extra distance but with less height, dash jump gives you super distance but costs 2 stamina
[3:13:23] <+OroOreo> Chariot Tackle
[3:13:23] <gryffinp> Hades Cerberus< Helltaker Cerberus< ULTRAKILL CERBERUS, THE GUARDIAN OF HELL
[3:13:27] <Aussie_Manny> 1 down
[3:13:30] <DSD24> Oh this is the Maneaters fight from Demon's Souls
[3:13:33] <%Javaa01> @RenoDeGeneric No that's later
[3:13:35] <%justmildlilac> Sick, good to know
[3:13:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @RenoDeGeneric kinda but later tho
[3:13:38] <+Ez3z> if you switch between weapon modes you dont have to wait for the relaod animation
[3:13:39] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Blood for the shoot-god
[3:13:39] <DeathByPoke7> this one took me a while
[3:13:40] <RetroCop87> KH2FM Cerberus
[3:13:44] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @j3sharp
[3:13:48] <+RenoDeGeneric> @Javaa01 @cobalt_phoenix_ PogChamp
[3:13:56] <Johannen> Cerberus has 3 heads thou...
[3:14:00] <%Mr_Strut> Gotta aim high
[3:14:01] <ashbirds> stamina management at risk
[3:14:02] <TheAmazingClaytor> YEET
[3:14:03] <DSD24> Three heads to pet
[3:14:07] <alephalpha> just use the normal shots
[3:14:11] <tux_3do> @Johannen probably three bosses will show up
[3:14:13] <thatsocrunchy> This boss is straight nightmare fuel
[3:14:23] <Louie_Salmon> Just going in with the regular shot is good honestly.
[3:14:24] <DucksForBrains> Punch ball?
[3:14:32] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> @hakita Is there a Railgun and or Lightning Gun a la Quake?
[3:14:38] <gryffinp> This boss can absolutely be dark soulsed to death, his tells are super slow
[3:14:40] <%Mr_Strut> Punch at range
[3:14:41] <%hakita> There's a railcannon later on yes
[3:14:47] <+UberWolfman> OH HEY
[3:14:49] <%Mr_Strut> Shoot at melee
[3:14:50] <Louie_Salmon> Uh would it hit twice? The bullets and explosion?
[3:15:02] <%mikesapartment> don't get penisy kid
[3:15:06] <nutimik> There is a railcannon, which can reflect off of the coin btw
[3:15:07] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> @hakita Cool, going to buy three copies of the game now
[3:15:17] <gryffinp> ANGERY MODE
[3:15:21] <TheAmazingClaytor> HOES MAD
[3:15:21] <%cobalt_phoenix_> HE ANGRY
[3:15:24] <ashbirds> hoes mad x10
[3:15:25] <+UberWolfman> Angi and Rudra!
[3:15:27] <%justmildlilac> He popped DT
[3:15:27] <BlackermanZX> OH LAWD HE ANGRY
[3:15:35] <Potatoidea> LUL
[3:15:38] <alephalpha> @hakita I assume higher difficulties will involve wya more grey health
[3:15:38] <nutimik> so close
[3:15:39] <+ianabstract> We ornstein and smogh boyyyyyys
[3:15:45] <+skylerpilot> @UberWolfman nah, thats later
[3:15:45] <IncredibleMeh> he angy
[3:15:52] <nutimik> yeah on Violent there is already more health cap
[3:15:53] <Potatoidea> So that's where the 3 heads come in
[3:15:56] <nutimik> makes it really hard
[3:16:04] <+OroOreo> damn hakitas in here love the game dude
[3:16:08] <emeraldskrull> woolies "nnnyeah"s have returned
[3:16:14] <thatsocrunchy> Holy shit that’s so stress inducing
[3:16:16] <alephalpha> I've pr rnaked violent didn't feel too different from normal
[3:16:24] <DSD24> Wow that shoulder check
[3:16:30] <alephalpha> but they ar eudner the same section
[3:16:45] <+RenoDeGeneric> He completely forgot the other form doesn't have to explode lol
[3:16:47] <nutimik> Not as much as during the previous demo I think, that got to like 40%
[3:16:50] <DSD24> Destiny style stomp
[3:17:11] <%FuqBoiSlim> you gotta kill em at the same time like agni and rudra
[3:17:12] <+skylerpilot> lol green shotgun doesn't have to explode either, he just keeps overcharging it
[3:17:46] <+MrAtheGreat> Good struggle tho
[3:17:57] <gryffinp> Well you don't HAVE to kill them at the same time, it's totally viable not to.
[3:17:59] <%justmildlilac> Try 3 charges on green shotgun, you don't have to overcharge all the time
[3:18:15] <+ianabstract> I like how you are bouncing around the arena like a pinball
[3:18:21] <ashbirds> or just shoot them with blue shotgun instead of altfire
[3:18:21] <%masterfire23> man this game makes my dick erect, made me remember how much i miss arena shooters
[3:18:31] <letshavecakes> The best part about this is that these become normal enemies later on
[3:18:37] <+skylerpilot> the challenge for this level is to get them to kill themselves by getting them low and letting them throw an orb too close
[3:18:50] <T_Sasquatch> Blood status : erect
[3:18:50] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1308260203280949248?s=20
[3:18:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> honestly with auto aim on the revolvo charged shot would be pretty good too

[3:19:31] <gryffinp> Until a man is thirty-five, he still thinks, every so often, that under the right circumstances he could be the baddest motherfucking video game in the world. If I quit his job and studied all of the best games, if I devoted my entire existence to making the sickest tech and the hottest tracks. If I just dropped out and devoted my life to being the best game dev ever.
[3:19:33] <DeathByPoke7> we are in hell
[3:19:34] <%FuqBoiSlim> LETS GOOOOO
[3:19:35] <gryffinp> I used to feel that way, too, but then I ran into Ultrakilll. In a way, this is liberating. I no longer has to worry about trying

[3:24:42] <ashbirds> after you're done with this quit to menu so you can do 1-1, since you just skipped it
[3:24:44] <gryffinp> fun fact there is a REAL question in the ultrakill speedrunning community about whether or not it's better to run 1-1 or to do the fountain exit and run 1-s
[3:24:48] <alephalpha> no nee dot be that close
[3:24:55] <%heartlesshealer> The Witness will give you panic attacks in paradise
[3:25:10] <letshavecakes> These aren't actually too hard, but with the stream int debuff, who knows
[3:25:11] <BlackermanZX> the witness is the hardest i've seen

[3:26:03] <BlackermanZX> monkaS
[3:26:04] <%heartlesshealer> =)
[3:26:06] <+smevvster> The secret levels are all different genres - this is puzzle. The other secret level (that woolie already missed) is horror.
[3:26:12] <gryffinp> Fuck that I loved The Witness AND Ultrakill.
[3:26:36] <ashbirds> the witness, coming spring 2023
[3:26:39] <%FuqBoiSlim> what type of crowd is into The Witness?
[3:26:47] <EternalJedi> oh my god
[3:26:53] <%Solidnick18> oh god
[3:26:56] <+smevvster> The horror secret level is too much for me
[3:27:03] <%Superbro64> Woolie mised 0-S chat?
[3:27:03] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh you haven't seen shit yet chat
[3:27:09] <Louie_Salmon> These get legitimately difficult btw
[3:27:13] <%Animatic_> i can't handle 0-S either.
[3:27:14] <+smevvster> Yeah he missed 0-S
[3:27:19] <ashbirds> 0-S is a nightmare
[3:27:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> 0-S got pat real good a few times
[3:27:27] <Mnemonicjohnny> The horror one got a bit easier when I realized that shooting the ghoulie drives it off
[3:27:42] <+skylerpilot> you just didn't click the screen
[3:27:43] <thatsocrunchy> I want there to be a puzzle where you just trace a pentagram
[3:27:44] <%heartlesshealer> well, pat is not a puzzle brain like woolie, so...
[3:27:48] <%Javaa01> Nah, you can do the colors in any order
[3:27:49] <+notsashasia> notsashasia subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[3:27:51] <SunsetJack> You did not confirm, that is why it failed.
[3:28:00] <%ChoculaUltra> more like ULTRACHILL.
[3:28:00] <%Javaa01> You just forgot to confirm your answer the first time around
[3:28:01] <+MrAtheGreat> No it’s because he didn’t click the last dot
[3:28:04] <gryffinp> Woolie vs. The Witness when
[3:28:06] <greengregguy> The witness side event
[3:28:07] <T_Sasquatch> Looool
[3:28:08] <%OmniFizzle> OmniFizzle subscribed at Tier 2. 
[3:28:15] <letshavecakes> There were so many of these that I was expecting at least one environment one at the end
[3:28:17] <+RahkshiLord> make sure to tell woolie to go back to that level after this or he'll miss an entire level
[3:28:22] <eldragon_1> Woolie vs Assumptions LUL
[3:28:31] <gryffinp> Yeah woolie needs to do 1-1 properly. it's IMPORTANT
[3:28:46] <Louie_Salmon> I would say humans are not pretty good creatures
[3:28:47] <alephalpha> yeah
[3:28:48] <+MrAtheGreat> Woolie do 1-1
[3:28:56] <%Mr_Strut> Technicality fighting is great
[3:28:58] <+MrAtheGreat> Chat needs to tell him hard
[3:29:01] <+TopTieramisu> jojo is the rube goldberg of shounen
[3:29:05] <SovPho> oh why does this feel like vr
[3:29:16] <+ghostfaceninja_> Shikamaru boys where u at
[3:29:17] <%hakita> Yeah after you're done with this secret mission I'd recommend exiting to main menu and playing 1-1 again since you skipped most of it
[3:29:20] <gryffinp> Because the FOV is REALLY high
[3:29:22] <T_Sasquatch> Writing jojo battles is insane to me. I can't imagine it
[3:29:37] <%FuqBoiSlim> Yeah like Hunter x Hunter woolieSMUG
[3:29:37] <Sollidnitro> this isn't the only secret you should be looking for.
[3:29:41] <%heartlesshealer> Hmmmmmmmm
[3:29:46] <+TopTieramisu> @T_Sasquatch step 1: wiki an obscure fact that captures your interest
[3:29:59] <Broand> Yeah just as a heads up, this is an optional secret, 1-1 still awaits you
[3:30:07] <+MrAtheGreat> Big Brain Reggie
[3:30:08] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah this is especially weird on controller
[3:30:15] <zenith0111> Is this Overkill? LUL
[3:30:16] <%ChoculaUltra> not counting Frog Fractions either.
[3:30:21] <SovPho> Ooooo have you played the Talos Principle?
[3:30:26] <FeltSn0wman> Myst is definitely one of my faves
[3:30:27] <%Mr_Strut> Portal?
[3:30:29] <tux_3do> 1 hour ago: RIP AND TEAR UNTIL ITS DONE. Now: p u z z l e h o u r s
[3:30:35] <alephalpha> tPLAY BABA IS YOU
[3:30:41] <%Mr_Strut> Also Talos Principal
[3:30:49] <DianaTheAscian> play baba instead
[3:30:53] <+b_aleph> puzzle! bois!
[3:30:58] <letshavecakes> Hope the stream doesn't end after this level
[3:30:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh fuck yeah Talos Principle was amazing
[3:31:00] <%FuqBoiSlim> PUZZLE!
[3:31:00] <%heartlesshealer> color dots
[3:31:02] <SovPho> Talos Principle is so good
[3:31:04] <+Dr_DangerPhD> The Witness is the kind of game where I'd 100% recommend taking notes
[3:31:05] <zenith0111> Is this The Witness? LUL LUL LUL
[3:31:08] <+b_aleph> BOIS!
[3:31:09] <%Mr_Strut> So what
[3:31:12] <SovPho> it kinda fucks up at the end but not bad enough to ruin the rest of the game
[3:31:20] <%Animatic_> baba gets WILD in the later puzzles.
[3:31:27] <alephalpha> yeah
[3:31:28] <Louie_Salmon> I mean, suee
[3:31:31] <alephalpha> baba just keep on going
[3:31:32] <californaya> is this The Witness
[3:31:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> talos principle is bibble puzzle bois
[3:31:36] <alephalpha> it's th ebest
[3:31:40] <ashbirds> woolie's doing really well at this
[3:31:42] <letshavecakes> baba gets wild early on if you're a smoothbrain
[3:31:43] <californaya> oh someone made that joke already, my b
[3:31:52] <%heartlesshealer> a learning appear =)
[3:31:53] <%Javaa01> White is neutral
[3:31:56] <+MrAtheGreat> MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS
[3:31:56] <ashbirds> it took me forever
[3:32:00] <gryffinp> It's not even a joke so much as it's just an observation
[3:32:01] <DianaTheAscian> its funny how Woolie had such a different reaction to this compared to pat
[3:32:02] <ZeeJiggle> I dunno if we're hitting 1-4, chat. I believe, but
[3:32:12] <letshavecakes> We might not even hit 1-1
[3:32:13] <SovPho> straight right and down, rest is red?
[3:32:14] <thatsocrunchy> It’s called the witness cause you are witnessing FUN right before your very eyes LUL

[3:35:20] <gryffinp> thank you reggie
[3:35:20] <%heartlesshealer> biting my lip he almost saw it
[3:35:31] <%justmildlilac> Solving puzzles should give you style meter @WoolieVersus
[3:35:32] <DianaTheAscian> lets see who gets this first
[3:35:38] <zenith0111> Taunt button in the witness LUL
[3:35:47] <+Ninjamaninjas> Imagine tuning in to Ultrakill on the puzzle section
[3:35:50] <+Someone_Kooky> Has he been told to replay the mission after this?
[3:35:54] <zenith0111> @ninjamaninjas ME
[3:35:57] <nutimik> yea
[3:35:59] <+Someone_Kooky> Because missing that weapon would suck
[3:36:02] <ashbirds> the dev and a few of us mentioned it yeah
[3:36:07] <%FuqBoiSlim> *looks at a slide puzzle* "come on, wimp!"
[3:36:08] <gryffinp> people in chat including the dev have said to replay the mission but they did not acknowledge it directly yet
[3:36:08] <%heartlesshealer> woolie
[3:36:09] <%mikesapartment> reggie already knows...
[3:36:10] <warmnoid> this witness sequel is crazy
[3:36:11] <DianaTheAscian> no
[3:36:11] <T_Sasquatch> Ultrakill : The puzzle game
[3:36:22] <nutimik> Ultrathink
[3:36:24] <letshavecakes> Pause in the middle of the puzzle to do a 360 and flip off the panel
[3:36:26] <+Someone_Kooky> Oh yeah, did the dev say he was working on a workaround for that, or is it staying as is?
[3:36:37] <+Someone_Kooky> In terms of missing the weapon if you take the secret level
[3:36:40] <andrewofbob> Blue ends on left
[3:36:41] <T_Sasquatch> Yo dev , put this on ps4 plz
[3:36:45] <zenith0111> Look at these stagger combos
[3:36:47] <%heartlesshealer> I bet reggie saw it
[3:36:50] <gryffinp> I kind of feel like it's a probllem that will only ever effect twitch streamers
[3:36:51] <alephalpha> actually this one's real simple
[3:36:59] <DianaTheAscian> reggie prob has it by now
[3:37:00] <VHLW> almost had it earlier
[3:37:04] <alephalpha> not a weird rule you're asusming
[3:37:05] <SovPho> can you cross the streams
[3:37:06] <gryffinp> one in ten thousand people actually playing the game are gonna find that exit on their FIRST try of 1-1
[3:37:09] <+ianabstract> overthinking for sure, blue just needs to go around the outside all the way
[3:37:10] <mdkcde> Reggie is giving woolie a headstart
[3:37:12] <alephalpha> unless it's a reallyw eir dassumption
[3:37:18] <DianaTheAscian> no
[3:37:20] <%heartlesshealer> hmmmm
[3:37:23] <%justmildlilac> Solving the puzzle level should give you the weapon at the end, yeah
[3:37:25] <+ladomania> woolie please
[3:37:28] <eldragon_1> Reggie limiting his power
[3:37:35] <+Someone_Kooky> True true, if I didn’t decide to replay the level anyway, I woulda missed it
[3:37:37] <letshavecakes> Blue can go through red X's
[3:37:41] <+Someone_Kooky> I just wanted to see all the content
[3:37:45] <MKII> close
[3:37:45] <%heartlesshealer> dot = must
[3:37:48] <tux_3do> the brains are extra smooth today
[3:37:52] <%Animatic_> reggie's got it already.
[3:37:54] <SovPho> red is very close wools
[3:37:56] <Louie_Salmon> Oh yeah he sees it
[3:37:58] <Div_the_Penguin> no it's not missing NotLikeThis
[3:37:59] <Daxalog> SADISTIC
[3:38:03] <zenith0111> This should give a big flash of kanji and let you zandatsu the puzzle board upon completion
[3:38:07] <JdotSweapA> blktasTHINK blktasTHINK
[3:38:09] <%heartlesshealer> YES
[3:38:12] <DianaTheAscian> no
[3:38:14] <gryffinp> There's a couple of viable solutions for this one
[3:38:14] <%blastonator> blastonator subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[3:38:14] <Div_the_Penguin> bingo
[3:38:16] <%Mr_Strut> Galaxy Brain Reggie
[3:38:17] <Daxalog> Apocalyptic!
[3:38:17] <%mikesapartment> thank you reggie
[3:38:17] <andrewofbob> Blue gets top, left and bottom dots, red gets right dot
[3:38:18] <letshavecakes> KING REGGIE
[3:38:18] <%heartlesshealer> thank you reggie
[3:38:18] <%cobalt_phoenix_> NOW THREE
[3:38:19] <+Taisuru> Just Make Purple and be done with it SMOrc
[3:38:19] <+ianabstract> dere ya go
[3:38:21] <DianaTheAscian> oh he got it
[3:38:33] <Louie_Salmon> This is a COMMITTED bit.
[3:38:34] <%heartlesshealer> yeah full tribute
[3:38:35] <DianaTheAscian> this is better
[3:38:40] <ashbirds> or both
[3:38:43] <letshavecakes> How about both?
[3:38:43] <%hakita> I love The Witness
[3:38:44] <%Superbro64> maybe both sajamSegue3
[3:38:47] <%Solidnick18> i love to hate it
[3:38:49] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah you gotta go back in the menu after this
[3:38:52] <%Javaa01> Yeah you should go back to that level after this to get the gun on it
[3:38:52] <mdkcde> we're in ULTRAWITNESS
[3:38:55] <nutimik> You can love something and still make fun of it though
[3:39:00] <JustYudha> It's nice
[3:39:03] <Mnemonicjohnny> high-intensity pulse-pounding SSStylish FPS character-action puzzles, y'all
[3:39:09] <T_Sasquatch> @hakita pleaseee ps4 release pleaseee
[3:39:16] <spardanwarrior> Making fun of it would be you pulling out your shotgun and just blasting the screen to bits
[3:39:31] <%FuqBoiSlim> Which is it chat? "UltraWitness" or "The Kill" ? 🤔
[3:39:37] <letshavecakes> You gotta parry the dots and just frame the end points
[3:39:38] <zenith0111> Holy shit so many puzzles LUL
[3:39:39] <gryffinp> @FuqBoiSlim you'll see
[3:39:45] <T_Sasquatch> The Kill is cooler
[3:39:50] <%masterfire23> yo the game has grenade jumps????
[3:39:51] <nutimik> This one took me way too long
[3:39:53] <%heartlesshealer> hmmmm
[3:39:56] <zenith0111> Nah combine them
[3:39:57] <DianaTheAscian> zoom
[3:39:57] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:39:59] <%FuqBoiSlim> GREEN?!
[3:40:00] <%Superbro64> You should be able to SSS rank the puzzles
[3:40:02] <Golden_Battler> I am shocked there are so many of these
[3:40:04] <zenith0111> Ultra kill the witness
[3:40:09] <myfaceisapotato> Dude did this fps just turn into The Witness????
[3:40:10] <+Someone_Kooky> Probably no consoles till 1.0
[3:40:10] <letshavecakes> The Murderer
[3:40:10] <%heartlesshealer> Hit start points to reset the lines if you gotta
[3:40:21] <+Ninjamaninjas> This feels less like the witness and more like that line game on android
[3:40:23] <+Someone_Kooky> Even then, not many newblood games go off of pc
[3:40:25] <DianaTheAscian> nice
[3:40:25] <SilverSnake55> Did he already do Something Wicked this way comes?
[3:40:26] <zenith0111> The Witness:Ultra Kill
[3:40:26] <myfaceisapotato> @zenith0111 yeah same lol
[3:40:28] <gryffinp> If I remember correctly that one took Pat a god damn eternity
[3:40:29] <%cobalt_phoenix_> last one
[3:40:30] <%Animatic_> there you go wools.
[3:40:34] <+botchdogg> This makes me miss professor layton
[3:40:34] <gryffinp> also this one
[3:40:37] <nutimik> Final Boss approaches
[3:40:41] <ashbirds> he missed 0-S
[3:40:44] <%heartlesshealer> hmmm
[3:40:46] <spardanwarrior> Yeah Pat took forever on that last one
[3:40:52] <ashbirds> fuck this one dude
[3:41:04] <%heartlesshealer> the boys are already kinda doing better
[3:41:11] <+Detectivemac9> it's funny because after playing the actual witness these puzzles look easy, fuck the witness
[3:41:11] <Div_the_Penguin> he almost did it just needed to redo blue a bit
[3:41:14] <WakeUpThrow> Woolie almost got it first try
[3:41:15] <gryffinp> Pat got through 0-s surprisingly quickly so by the law of inversions if woolie tries 0-s it'll take all night
[3:41:25] <letshavecakes> Narrator: It did not want you to do the simplest route
[3:41:26] <myfaceisapotato> DO Green first then solve around that
[3:41:33] <TheAmazingClaytor> Damn I love this game ULTRAKILL
[3:41:42] <NeroInfinite> tic tac toe
[3:41:47] <%heartlesshealer> hmmmm

[3:56:19] <alephalpha> you're alternate fire is amgnets
[3:56:21] <%Javaa01> Alt fire is a bullet magnet
[3:56:22] <%DensityD> THE MAGNET MINES
[3:56:23] <+ianabstract> then fire magnetic bullets
[3:56:24] <nutimik> This is not a mine, it's a magnet
[3:56:27] <alephalpha> ALT FIR IS BULLE TMAGNET
[3:56:27] <FeltSn0wman> alt fire then shoot
[3:56:29] <+OroOreo> magnet
[3:56:30] <+Superspider51> Magnent
[3:56:32] <%heartlesshealer> Look at what you shoot
[3:56:33] <+AnonymousNumbers> altfire fires a magnet
[3:56:34] <NeroInfinite> yes morse code or an explosion Kappa
[3:56:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> alt then shoot
[3:56:37] <alephalpha> the magnetise your bullets
[3:56:38] <%DensityD> how do magnets wokr????
[3:56:39] <%cobalt_phoenix_> no magnet
[3:56:39] <+AnonymousNumbers> shoot
[3:56:40] <+MrAtheGreat> alt is that fifth element gun thiung?
[3:56:41] <%justmildlilac> Magnet, then shoot
[3:56:43] <+Taisuru> Dropped a mime
[3:56:44] <+ianabstract> Alt fire shoots a bullet magnet, the bullets will zip between them
[3:56:51] <gryffinp> I don't even think that "shot" does damage
[3:56:53] <EternalJedi> rooH LEGION GUN
[3:56:55] <%DensityD> BEES
[3:56:58] <alephalpha> alt fire put down two
[3:56:58] <EternalJedi> PREPARE FOR TITANFALL
[3:56:59] <DianaTheAscian> @WoolieVersus shoot that into an enemy and shoot
[3:57:00] <+ianabstract> Fire two magnets
[3:57:03] <+ianabstract> to create bullet courses
[3:57:05] <Golden_Battler> It's a nailgun
[3:57:14] <Louie_Salmon> Fire multiple magnets, all over
[3:57:17] <%DensityD> 2 magnetic fields is STRANGE
[3:57:17] <alephalpha> pur doiwn twothey're magnetise
[3:57:21] <nutimik> only nailgun bullets are pulled in
[3:57:21] <%heartlesshealer> Woolie, put a magnet on each wall =)
[3:57:23] <gryffinp> There's some fucking TECH with this gun
[3:57:25] <wibbwobbler> WAP
[3:57:29] <alephalpha> guess what you can put them in enemis
[3:57:32] <alephalpha> or cretae bullet storms
[3:57:40] <gryffinp> This gun also brings the engine to it's knees
[3:57:41] <nutimik> you can put them on enemies
[3:57:42] <+Taisuru> Put more distance between them
[3:57:44] <+AnonymousNumbers> you can put magnets on enemies for even more generous autoaim
[3:57:50] <%cobalt_phoenix_> or just hit them with the magnet
[3:57:50] <gryffinp> god the auto aim is gonna ruin this gun isn't it
[3:57:57] <%heartlesshealer> Or try dropping a new magnet after you've set some that are holding nails <3
[3:58:00] <%Javaa01> Or just shoot it into an enemy directly
[3:58:04] <Daxalog> Put the magnet on the enemies
[3:58:05] <DianaTheAscian> @WoolieVersus u can but them into enemys as well
[3:58:10] <+ianabstract> or you can stick a magnet on a boss
[3:58:11] <letshavecakes> autoaim ruins a lot of things
[3:58:13] <+Superspider51> you can stick the magnet into enemies
[3:58:15] <+500_pts> you can just stick it into the enemy
[3:58:17] <alephalpha> you cna stick amagnet tot he enemy
[3:58:20] <+skylerpilot> stick the enemy
[3:58:21] <Louie_Salmon> And yeah just shooting them totally works, it is a gun
[3:58:23] <alephalpha> stick amagnet toi the enemy
[3:58:28] <%justmildlilac> You can stick magnet onto enemy
[3:58:31] <%Mr_Strut> Shredder

[3:58:36] <+ianabstract> we call that The Deleter
[3:58:37] <DeathByPoke7> shredded
[3:58:38] <gryffinp> They're nails.
[3:58:43] <+skylerpilot> its a nail gun
[3:58:45] <+MrAtheGreat> continued damge
[3:58:46] <DucksForBrains> BLOOD SHOWER
[3:58:52] <%OmniFizzle> woolieSMUG woolieSMUG
[3:58:52] <+ianabstract> its how ya get your dots
[3:59:01] <%heartlesshealer> LUL
[3:59:04] <gryffinp> i was about to say, woolie
[3:59:06] <nutimik> Shotgun gives waaaay more heals
[3:59:07] <%Mr_Strut> Not much blood huh
[3:59:07] <DianaTheAscian> its a super dot
[3:59:08] <Louie_Salmon> Just gotta get in
[3:59:10] <+ianabstract> Now how is this for a followup to the shotgun
[3:59:14] <Johannen> Lizard Brain ASSume Woolie)
[3:59:17] <lazerscraper> shoot with revolvers to detonate
[3:59:20] <+nekodelic> That window is a little sus
[3:59:21] <letshavecakes> shotgun still better
[3:59:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> idk what it is about this gun that makes it so easy to get ultrakill with it
[3:59:29] <gryffinp> The fucking bullet clouds you can make with this gun are beautiful
[3:59:31] <+ianabstract> Its the gun from Fifth Element
[3:59:34] <+Ninjamaninjas> So what you're saying is... This is manual...aim-assist?
[3:59:35] <+zed11111111> turns it into a smart gun
[3:59:39] <Louie_Salmon> Custom smart gun
[3:59:42] <EternalJedi> rooH SMART CORE ACTIVATED
[3:59:45] <+Taisuru> Mark multiple enemies for BIG damage
[3:59:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> nailgun goes brrrrr
[3:59:53] <lazerscraper> wanted
[3:59:54] <letshavecakes> This gun really benefits from the game having no stale moves style loss
[4:00:00] <+500_pts> ok so, stick some nails in an enemy, then put out a magnet, then launch the enemy
[4:00:07] <UnfilteredComic> Enemies with nails stuck IN THEM can also be magnitized
[4:00:08] <DianaTheAscian> @WoolieVersus when the magnet explodes it shoots the bullets around it as well
[4:00:09] <spardanwarrior> Nailgun indeed go brrr
[4:00:11] <+500_pts> and the magnet will pull the enemy
[4:00:13] <%Javaa01> Wrong way
[4:00:13] <alephalpha> umm
[4:00:18] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @500_pts now you're getting it
[4:00:19] <Daxalog> Its that one titanfall grenade
[4:00:20] <Louie_Salmon> @letshavecakes That probably should be a thing, honestly
[4:00:20] <+skylerpilot> @letshavecakes it does have stalemoves
[4:00:23] <+ianabstract> you can set up the magnets, fire a bunch of nails, switch to the shotgun
[4:00:25] <%Mr_Strut> Big loop
[4:00:27] <+500_pts> @cobalt_phoenix_ i work on the game lmao

[4:01:22] <DucksForBrains> PAINT THE TOWN RED
[4:01:26] <%hakita> Nailgun's great consistent damage but the blood healing is weaker since the nails plug up the wounds
[4:01:28] <+MrAtheGreat> Nailgun best gun?
[4:01:39] <gryffinp> The nailgun is my favorite gun in the game
[4:01:40] <nutimik> in the flower bed
[4:01:42] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it was sitting on the altar thing with the big head
[4:01:42] <Louie_Salmon> You slid into it, it was just on the ground
[4:01:45] <FeltSn0wman> it was on that coffin thing right where the spawn for the face is @WoolieVersus
[4:01:47] <%Animatic_> it was in the same room as the face.
[4:01:48] <+MrAtheGreat> It formed from your unconcious desires
[4:01:57] <gryffinp> but I use it less as an autoaim bullet hose and more as a crazy bullet flail
[4:01:58] <%cobalt_phoenix_> THE FRAMES
[4:02:01] <gryffinp> yeah this shit
[4:02:01] <+zed11111111> What form of power is this?

[4:04:02] <+Detectivemac9> the magnets can be broken manually though
[4:04:04] <FeltSn0wman> dont spoil the secrets
[4:04:04] <+MrAtheGreat> Woolie thought he could hold the magnet

[4:04:50] <+zed11111111> the nailgun is basically The Luce
[4:04:52] <%Javaa01> You need to use the Magnet and Overheat in combination
[4:04:53] <gryffinp> The nailgun alternate isn't even a real gun, it's an accessory for the real nailgun
[4:04:59] <%heartlesshealer> subtract magnet, add bullet

[4:05:45] <Louie_Salmon> You can switch to the other though
[4:05:46] <nutimik> it doesn't recharge if you keep shooting
[4:05:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that post brrrrt clarity
[4:05:47] <gryffinp> Important note: if you fire the super charge gun and put it in slow mode, the normal nailgun still fires at full speed, so you can just switch back
[4:05:48] <FeltSn0wman> use a magnet with that shit
[4:05:50] <letshavecakes> No heat makes nail gun sad
[4:05:55] <Louie_Salmon> Oh yeah and you can totally combo them
[4:05:56] <+cvp5127> post nut clarity
[4:05:56] <%ChoculaUltra> fatty
[4:05:57] <nutimik> it recharges while switched to another gun
[4:05:58] <%heartlesshealer> switch between minigun types =)
[4:06:00] <%justmildlilac> Use a magnet then overcharge
[4:06:06] <alephalpha> magnet then overcharge
[4:06:09] <letshavecakes> Now combine. GATTAI
[4:06:14] <%Mr_Strut> Does it recharge while on a different gun?
[4:06:19] <%justmildlilac> Magnet then overcharge @WoolieVersus
[4:06:20] <EternalJedi> BRRRRRRRR
[4:06:29] <alephalpha> ovmagnet then overcvharge\
[4:06:32] <FeltSn0wman> swap to the other nailgun it works just fine without sinks
[4:06:34] <+ianabstract> I love the little ding
[4:06:38] <%heartlesshealer> recharges during switch out
[4:06:41] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus The magnet mode doesn't lose firerate when you're out of battery
[4:06:42] <+MrAtheGreat> woolie gotta style switch for max STYLE

[4:17:06] <UnfilteredComic> Youget more points for weapon swap
[4:17:07] <Broand> You might be able to hit the coin if you're looking away from the enemy
[4:17:08] <gryffinp> what a tragedy 1-4 will be
[4:17:10] <+nekodelic> dark syde bill
[4:17:13] <alephalpha> wow autoaim is gonan ruin 1-4\
[4:17:14] <+BlackSunEmperor> some tight af jungle
[4:17:31] <%Animatic_> 1-4's still going to be fun even with autoaim.
[4:17:32] <+Astrobstrd> SourPls
[4:17:33] <%Animatic_> probably.
[4:17:34] <FeltSn0wman> SourPls

[4:17:41] <SeshohoCian> Best track time
[4:17:43] <%FuqBoiSlim> yes
[4:17:44] <letshavecakes> This song slaps hard
[4:17:46] <Louie_Salmon> Oh new message there?
[4:17:47] <+MrAtheGreat> so, only bitches stay inside
[4:17:50] <UnfilteredComic> Red route is hard
[4:17:51] <alephalpha> new messga eyeah
[4:17:55] <+Astrobstrd> Best track in the game tbh, man goes apeshit on the harpsichord
[4:17:57] <Mnemonicjohnny> Yo, crank the music
[4:17:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @gryffinp probably unless he takes forever here
[4:18:09] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus Get both skulls for a secret bossfight that you will most likely not be able to live through
[4:18:10] <Broand> Get both colours anyway tho
[4:18:10] <gryffinp> Wait did he JUST NOW realize those were flamethrowers
[4:18:15] <FeltSn0wman> P ranking this level is a bitch and a half
[4:18:15] <alephalpha> wow
[4:18:23] <alephalpha> this was the hardets p rank for me
[4:18:36] <gryffinp> I still haven't gotten my full p-ranks yet
[4:18:38] <zenith0111> LAVA LUL
[4:18:41] <Broand> yeah it's a hard P rank
[4:18:44] <alephalpha> I wa salways ahair too slwo or msise done emnmy
[4:18:47] <gryffinp> oddly enough I had the most trouble so far on bridgeburner
[4:18:51] <gryffinp> i can't really explain why
[4:18:53] <+MrAtheGreat> oooo the heatsink causes fire damage
[4:19:03] <%Animatic_> it's really easy to miss an enemy in bridgeburner
[4:19:04] <Bedskirts> our guys see the gold coin flip stuff yet? there are so combat options and details in this thing?
[4:19:05] <+smevvster> The name of this track is "Castle Vein"
[4:19:08] <%Animatic_> for whatever reason.
[4:19:11] <%justmildlilac> You can turn up music in settings
[4:19:19] <alephalpha> I think the hardets challenge in the game otehr then actually no hitting it was the levelk that asks you to speedrun it
[4:19:23] <gryffinp> @Bedskirts he did but auto aim doesn't track the coin so it got sidelined hard
[4:19:23] <+MrAtheGreat> oh no more gameplay D:
[4:19:30] <+Shubreaker> what is woolie's control setup rn
[4:19:31] <zenith0111> KILL HARD DIE HARD
[4:19:32] <%Animatic_> DOKKAN'D
[4:19:35] <FeltSn0wman> controller
[4:19:38] <DucksForBrains> @WoolieVersus Reggie the entire current OST is on Hakitas youtube channel.
[4:19:40] <+MrAtheGreat> Dosho?
[4:19:41] <letshavecakes> Oh yeah, he screwed up at the beginning and made the music real quiet, didn't he
[4:19:43] <UnfilteredComic> So no head?
[4:19:45] <TheAmazingClaytor> So no head?
[4:19:49] <TheAmazingClaytor> Fuck
[4:19:51] <+Shubreaker> exclusively controller?
[4:19:53] <%justmildlilac> 56% iirc
[4:19:58] <alephalpha> @WoolieVersus can I make a reuest of turning autoaim off for a certain elvel otherwis eit will ruin it
[4:20:09] <%Mr_Strut> No sleepin
[4:20:13] <alephalpha> kb+m is standard
[4:20:20] <+Shubreaker> not the weird mouse/controller hybrid he was trying 4 a bit?
[4:20:30] <gryffinp> woolie you fool
[4:20:35] <letshavecakes> The autoaim has already tricked him into thinking this gun is the best thing in the game, it's too late
[4:20:37] <+MrAtheGreat> bullets are going behind because of magnet
[4:20:38] <gryffinp> there is a magnet behind you and alll of your bullets are going backwards
[4:20:51] <gryffinp> @letshavecakes the nailgun IS the best gun in the game though
[4:21:02] <Louie_Salmon> @shubreaker The world isn't ready for the demi-controller, this man was born before his time
[4:21:03] <letshavecakes> That's not how you spell shotgun
[4:21:08] <alephalpha> @gryffinp umm the magnum is greatest gun
[4:21:13] <Broand> you have to go through both doors and get both skull without dying and quickly to get the P rank which is ruough
[4:21:36] <SeshohoCian> Every gun in this game is the best gun in the game
[4:21:38] <+MrAtheGreat> might need suuper pistol for that instakill boy
[4:21:38] <zenith0111> Guys the the answer is you should swapping your guns like dante
[4:21:45] <alephalpha> you also know i'M RIGHT YOU DON'T HAVE TO UNLOCK FOUR SECRETS TO GET THE NAILGUN
[4:21:49] <letshavecakes> Nobody tell woolie about the secret agni & rudra fight on this level
[4:21:58] <alephalpha> @zenith0111 sorry you're actually right
[4:22:11] <%Javaa01> Slabs are just for the Slab Pistol
[4:22:12] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:22:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait devs are there plans for more guns?
[4:22:21] <alephalpha> slab pistol is godlike though
[4:22:21] <Mnemonicjohnny> I can confirm, swapping between all nine variants is the absolute best
[4:22:26] <+MrAtheGreat> but those sick parries tho
[4:22:29] <%Javaa01> It got nerfed
[4:22:39] <alephalpha> just alternate between two slab pistols to kill 3-2 uper eaisly
[4:22:45] <%Javaa01> It's still good, just not the best weapon in the game
[4:22:48] <%Mr_Strut> Just parry all day
[4:22:49] <alephalpha> ahhh
[4:22:50] <+Shubreaker> nail-revolve-shot-nail-shot-ROYAL GUARF
[4:22:51] <alephalpha> thta''s good
[4:22:54] <alephalpha> it felt too storng
[4:23:20] <%Animatic_> the speedruns are wild, yeah.
[4:23:27] <%cobalt_phoenix_> YEYEEY
[4:23:42] <nutimik> if you get the second skull you get something special though
[4:23:49] <gryffinp> My only complaint about the altvolver nerf is that I wish there was less delay between switching to the alt piercer and beginning a charge
[4:23:52] <zenith0111> SSShitstorm
[4:23:53] <huskarl_zap> Ultrakill could beat Dante up in a bar.
[4:23:54] <letshavecakes> Woolie taking down entire groups of enemies literally without moving the camera, autoaim is wild
[4:24:04] <alephalpha> autoaim is absurd in thsi agme
[4:24:13] <+MrAtheGreat> I think it's a smarter idea to swicth guns after shotgun explosion to skip the animation
[4:24:16] <zenith0111> Ultrakill is the videogame that inspired Dante to do cool gun shit
[4:24:25] <alephalpha> cana nyone else think of an aim assist this stoing in any otehr game?
[4:24:40] <%Javaa01> Just go up the stairs
[4:24:45] <letshavecakes> Dual pistols with rainstorm when
[4:24:46] <derap41> oh I love this early PS1 style
[4:24:56] <EternalJedi> limesD EEKUM BOKUM
[4:24:59] <gryffinp> that moment when reggie briefly forgot about walking to his destination in favor of suicide
[4:25:16] <derap41> This a quake clone
[4:25:21] <derap41> ?
[4:25:21] <ashbirds> can't wait for ultrakill 2 to introduce style switching
[4:25:22] <Louie_Salmon> It's so strong
[4:25:32] <gryffinp> @derap41 no but also yes.
[4:25:35] <UnfilteredComic> @derap41 it has quake in its blood stream
[4:25:35] <alephalpha> I mena you kind alareayd got styl switching
[4:25:37] <nutimik> nailgun eats big enemies for breakfast
[4:25:44] <+MrAtheGreat> sick stuff woolie
[4:25:47] <huskarl_zap> the game plays it self on controller
[4:25:47] <derap41> It has autoaim?
[4:25:56] <letshavecakes> woolie pls
[4:25:59] <UnfilteredComic> You can switch weapons to reset the charge
[4:26:03] <alephalpha> he turned autoaim on
[4:26:04] <zenith0111> Ultrakill gives you a Dance Macabre Combo
[4:26:10] <Broand> It has autoaim for console players
[4:26:11] <derap41> Couple more years well have woolie playing Unreal Tournament 2004
[4:26:26] <Broand> er controller players
[4:26:27] <gryffinp> I just noticed the autoaim snapping to cerberus's limbs seperatelly
[4:26:29] <+Shubreaker> is there no slider for autoaim
[4:26:37] <letshavecakes> It's absolutely playable without the autoaim, too
[4:26:43] <RetroCop87> EEKUM :(
[4:26:50] <huskarl_zap> bokum
[4:26:50] <alephalpha> @Broand the thing i s I pranked it on controller cause there were too many keey for the way y hands are specifically fucke dup
[4:26:51] <Louie_Salmon> Definitely would be hard on controller
[4:26:53] <gryffinp> I'm tempted to say something about the auto-aim but it might be a bit too mean
[4:26:55] <derap41> Nom Nom Nom
[4:26:58] <FeltSn0wman> tbh auto aim is fairly balanced bc u cant really use the marksman and thats just better auto aim
[4:27:01] <UnfilteredComic> shower in dat blood
[4:27:03] <alephalpha> autoaim is deifntiely not neccassary
[4:27:10] <Mnemonicjohnny> @zenith0111 Yeah, the Danse Macabre combo is "do it yourself, ya scrub"
[4:27:13] <+Shubreaker> is there anything between nothing and "hold trigger and watch things die"
[4:27:19] <%Mr_Strut> No magnet?
[4:27:28] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @huskarl_zap
[4:27:29] <+Superspider51> aim is necessary
[4:27:31] <letshavecakes> I play on controller, didn't even know about the mouse sensitivity thing, and I was able to beat it just fine
[4:27:32] <ashbirds> in fairness woolie's still dying a fair amount with autoaim
[4:27:32] <gryffinp> woolie has forgotten about the magnets in the face of auto-aim
[4:27:41] <%FuqBoiSlim> B I G K I L L
[4:27:46] <+Superspider51> wow
[4:27:49] <Broand> No wait

[4:31:50] <alephalpha> autoaim trivialieses it but it's so cool
[4:31:50] <+Superspider51> next one is short
[4:31:51] <+Detectivemac9> Just -see- it
[4:31:51] <%Javaa01> 1-4 has no combat beyond the boss, you can see it and cut it there

[4:32:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @WoolieVersus if you you plan on pt2 then might be better to wait
[4:32:47] <alephalpha> fair enough
[4:32:51] <alephalpha> get some reats woolie
[4:32:51] <nutimik> yeah that's true

[4:32:52] <ashbirds> valid
[4:32:52] <gryffinp> the pain makes it real.
[4:32:53] <huskarl_zap> wait whos talking?
[4:32:55] <%heartlesshealer> fair, but it's the most woolie-bait thing ever
[4:32:58] <letshavecakes> It says a lot about how much Woolie likes this game that he's even almost considering this
[4:33:06] <plankk56> hit the hay
[4:33:10] <%Javaa01> The puzzle can be skipped
[4:33:18] <alephalpha> puzzle cna be ski[pep[d
[4:33:26] <alephalpha> though autoaim might ruin it
[4:33:28] <That_Mojo> gotta make the executive decision to take the break/call it
[4:33:29] <%justmildlilac> Puzzle can be skipped
[4:33:32] <+MrAtheGreat> We coming back to tyhis?
[4:33:36] <nutimik> to be fair.. I don't want to ruin it for him if hes's tired as shit
[4:33:42] <Louie_Salmon> I mean, up to y'all, ultimately
[4:33:43] <alephalpha> that's true
[4:33:45] <Louie_Salmon> But damn

[4:33:49] <+b_aleph> Make it a full LP
[4:33:56] <letshavecakes> WOO
[4:33:58] <ZeeJiggle> And now the worry of "overhyped" sets in.
[4:34:00] <Louie_Salmon> Yeyeye
[4:34:10] <+MrAtheGreat> Full LP is always an option
[4:34:14] <%heartlesshealer> It will be okay to quit during the real cool shit, we just want you to see it before ending

[4:41:58] <Louie_Salmon> Damn that health
[4:42:08] <Louie_Salmon> Doing it
[4:42:08] <%heartlesshealer> close
[4:42:09] <Mnemonicjohnny> Are *we* the Vergil here? I mean, we're the blue one
[4:42:20] <gryffinp> V2 is definitely the cocky one
[4:42:21] <DianaTheAscian> he might do it LUL
[4:42:22] <zenith0111> EASY MODE IS NOW SELECTABLE
[4:42:25] <gweatgawi> BLOOD IS FUEL SourPls
[4:42:25] <letshavecakes> This game is Vergils all the way down
[4:42:28] <+smevvster> This isn't even THE Vergil. This is just "a" vergil of this game.
[4:42:30] <%Mr_Strut> This party's gettin crazy!
[4:42:31] <Louie_Salmon> Yo you're juggling him
[4:42:36] <UnfilteredComic> If you arent stylish he gets pissed
[4:42:37] <FeltSn0wman> hey thanks so much for doing this @WoolieVersus <3
[4:42:39] <Broand> you juggled him
[4:42:45] <gweatgawi> RIP AND TEAR SourPls
[4:42:46] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> Oops! All Vergils.
[4:42:49] <nutimik> auto aim is doing a lotta work here lol
[4:42:51] <+MrAtheGreat> will he bow again if you dont shoot him?
[4:43:08] <TheAmazingClaytor> SADISTIC
[4:43:10] <UnfilteredComic> I frames
[4:43:13] <+OroOreo> dash
[4:43:13] <gryffinp> no, after the first time he always begins the fight as soon as he lands
[4:43:14] <+smevvster> Your dash has i-frames man
[4:43:21] <Broand> nah he bows once
[4:43:21] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1308260203280949248?s=20
[4:43:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> if you keep shooting like that it keeps him in the air, then you can't heal
[4:43:22] <letshavecakes> Wanna see Woolie try a second playthrough without the aim
[4:43:24] <nutimik> wait did he get stuck in the ceiling?
[4:43:26] <DianaTheAscian> @MrAtheGreat nope
[4:43:26] <andrewofbob> Round 1: motivated; round 2+: “scum”
[4:43:32] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus He's shooting the same exact charge pistol you have at you
[4:43:33] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @alephalpha
[4:43:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @nutimik he's being juggled
[4:43:45] <+MrAtheGreat> @DianaTheAscian oh wells
[4:43:47] <%heartlesshealer> Blood heal has range limits
[4:43:48] <+smevvster> There's a sound queue on those shots.
[4:44:03] <letshavecakes> Autoaim literally aiming off-screen lmao
[4:44:03] <gryffinp> Despite the visuals of the blood rain, healing is 100% about proximity to the enemy and nothing else
[4:44:20] <%heartlesshealer> ^
[4:44:20] <+MrAtheGreat> @Javaa01 Are you saying woolie's being wrecked by the starting pistol LUL
[4:44:21] <gweatgawi> Autoaim is actually sick in this game hello?
[4:44:25] <+MrAtheGreat> V2 is cool
[4:44:27] <+Spider1991> it is
[4:44:27] <UnfilteredComic> Youre juggling
[4:44:30] <%cobalt_phoenix_> stop shooting to have him go down, you're juggling
[4:44:31] <+500_pts> youre juggling him
[4:44:31] <%Mr_Strut> Get higher
[4:44:33] <ashbirds> he only stays away if you stay away
[4:44:34] <+Detectivemac9> you're juggling him
[4:44:37] <Broand> Stop shooting, you're juggling him
[4:44:39] <nutimik> you're shooting him into the air
[4:44:43] <zenith0111> TRICK UP TO HIM
[4:44:44] <DianaTheAscian> @WoolieVersus your juggling him LUL
[4:44:46] <Mnemonicjohnny> The starting pistol is also a sniper rifle, so yeah
[4:44:48] <FeltSn0wman> he enrages when you juggle him
[4:44:51] <+MrAtheGreat> did woolie just parry the glass?
[4:45:03] <gryffinp> SHOTGUN DUELS
[4:45:07] <+Ez3z> switch shotgun modes to skip the reload animation
[4:45:09] <%Javaa01> @MrAtheGreat Yes, but the starting pistol is still incredibly powerful, and on Violent, he uses the coins too
[4:45:21] <UnfilteredComic> PogChamp
[4:45:28] <Louie_Salmon> You have several dashes, and it recharges very quickly
[4:45:29] <alephalpha> starting pistol is gerat and slab psitol is only better
[4:45:30] <+MrAtheGreat> @Javaa01 That's amazing.
[4:45:30] <FeltSn0wman> PogChamp
[4:45:36] <%heartlesshealer> You can stop now if you need to, thank you guys for looking at this fight <3
[4:45:37] <%Javaa01> But you can shoot his coins before he gets a chance
[4:45:46] <zenith0111> V2 IS SH'MOVIN
[4:45:47] <%Livelinne> !uptime
[4:45:47] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 45 minutes
[4:45:50] <+Detectivemac9> he's too powerful
[4:45:50] <UnfilteredComic> Use both
[4:46:08] <%nosubstancex> nosubstancex subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! Much love from Brandon P and Maribel O
[4:46:08] <gweatgawi> go for shotgun when youre damaged
[4:46:24] <nutimik> Yeah don't worry about beating him now, this is a hard fight, about as hard as the final boss of EA
[4:46:28] <gryffinp> I think that, because enemies on Standard and Violent have the same hp and damage and just have different movement and attack patterns, V2 is actually the most nerfed enemy in standard compared to vioent
[4:46:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> honestly don't worry too much about finishing this it's hard enough as it is and even more when tired
[4:46:33] <+MrAtheGreat> almost half
[4:46:34] <sleepy_pink> oh I see I've tuned in just in time for VERGIL
[4:46:44] <gryffinp> he spends so much time walking on the ground on normal it's nuts
[4:46:44] <+MrAtheGreat> 1/3
[4:46:50] <Louie_Salmon> Doing it
[4:46:53] <+RealThiele> can woolie soar where the ginger fell
[4:46:54] <+MrAtheGreat> ALMSOT
[4:46:56] <+MrAtheGreat> ON THE ROPES
[4:47:04] <+Ez3z> up close and personal is best for this fight u got it
[4:47:10] <Mnemonicjohnny> Man, seeing the difference between this and Violent V2 is like night and day
[4:47:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> YEAAAAA

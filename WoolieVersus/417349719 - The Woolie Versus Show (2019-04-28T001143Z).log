[0:11:59] <$Superdandy96> @hotbloodedhero like Joey wheeler?!?
[0:11:59] <gespenst_mr_ghost> Nah, you can beat the game now
[0:11:59] <DonatelloJose> you have to do it before you fight lancers dad
[0:12:00] <unclerizla> you have to do it before a certain point
[0:12:01] <mayorrev> chairKillager
[0:12:01] <+Beerswithbears> NOW
[0:12:02] <+TheImmortal70> One
[0:12:02] <%ozzrabbit> Woolie, you’re not going to read your donations or subscribers?
[0:12:05] <gustavozxd> no do the secret boss NOW OR NEVER Kappa
[0:12:06] <SirSmudgey> You're locked out after the final boss
[0:12:07] <+Toblo1> Only one
[0:12:08] <stellar_flare> There is only one secret boss Woolie
[0:12:10] <JoeNeutrino> I only know of 1 secret boss
[0:12:10] <grayjammer> SPINNING SPINNING
[0:12:13] <+TeethMuncher> Did they beat it last time?
[0:12:16] <DXLelouch24> Woolie did you see Endgame yet? Go See It
[0:12:16] <%DedlokPM> you have to do it before the last boss unless you make a second save
[0:12:17] <+Piejumper5814> have to do it before king confrontation
[0:12:18] <+TheImmortal70> @woolieversus After you beat the game, you'll be able to reload the last save and you'll be able to do it
[0:12:19] <EnlightenedKramer> one one secret boss
[0:12:23] <waterstealer> it's better to do it now
[0:12:24] <+ceaselessdiplomacy> wait i thought there was only one
[0:12:24] <+JustToWatch> you do have to do it before the final thing
[0:12:26] <zeroraider> There's a long point of no return
[0:12:27] <Tisaric> your save file is always before the final boss
[0:12:28] <shiny_prinny> once you complete the demo you can come back pretty easily
[0:12:29] <+FloorBurger> Just try it.
[0:12:32] <weissguard> Little bit, yeah.
[0:12:32] <mayorrev> s a n s
[0:12:35] <+Beerswithbears> Must be NOW

[0:12:39] <+Toa697> they are lying
[0:12:40] <@Solidus_113> they need to find the key parts
[0:12:42] <+Toblo1> Nowhere near as rude as Sans, but just as chaotic

[0:12:44] <$jobbedbone> SPEEEEnnnn
[0:12:46] <Thirtine> hey y'all! KonCha
[0:12:48] <+twohitgood> before the final boss
[0:12:48] <gespenst_mr_ghost> You can just reload the save if you want to
[0:12:57] <%DedlokPM> OH YEAH! THAT IS RIGHT!
[0:13:00] <Tisaric> You can reload the save after doing it
[0:13:00] <%ozzrabbit> I think you got some new subs
[0:13:02] <unclerizla> You have to complete a puzzle that requires you to move on a bit so
[0:13:06] <%DedlokPM> THe save is before the boss
[0:13:09] <$Superdandy96> Multi save!!!
[0:13:09] <starotter70> I beat the game and it let me go back @WoolieVersus
[0:13:11] <Thirtine> yep, no lock out conditions
[0:13:12] <Laironx3> Yes, you can reload your last state before you reach the ending. But I played the PC ver.
[0:13:21] <%DedlokPM> So yeah you can do it after the epilogue

[0:21:35] <Thirtine> @agadejobi ti changes things about the ending, and in the previous game (undertale) it was a very signifigant change. here, not too much changes yet
[0:21:40] <+blastazoid26> Sup woolz
[0:21:44] <sappinmahbinyot> There are some enemies that are easier to spare than kill, and other way around. But it's been quite long since I've played this so I don't know exactly.

[1:08:37] <%king_wragles> @WoolieVersus you queued it up, but then canceled it with the dual action
[1:08:40] <derap41> chat is wrong about what 3 means

[1:09:24] <DonatelloJose> @hntronium very meta
[1:09:25] <%Akanesasusora> it's not like the items they use now will matter, since they'll just revert the save to before the fight

[1:09:44] <waterstealer> just keep fighting and he gets tired
[1:09:46] <televisedrevolting> Just got done with Katana Zero. Teared up a bit.
[1:09:47] <+skizzuto> you don't have to fight, but do whatever you want
[1:09:48] <@Solidus_113> if you're passive you just wait for him to finish the speech
[1:09:50] <sir_nack> @GohanEgret we need a damn goof compendium to keep track of all the stream memes
[1:09:50] <Riverinah> Woolie stop feeding her LIES

[1:10:06] <+MagickBurritoh> Why would chat say who is right? chat calls out bullshit
[1:10:15] <+ThatGuyfromMars> chat is always wrong
[1:10:18] <+SolverCODO> if we're watching Paige and Pat is there, who is 1 and who is 2
[1:10:20] <%GohanEgret> @sir_nack the number of memes spawned just from pat and paige's streams is massive
[1:10:22] <%jinking79> yeah u can fight or not to win
[1:10:25] <hntronium> KILL
[1:10:29] <waterstealer> yes
[1:10:34] <subjectg> you can just do whatever really
[1:10:34] <waterstealer> thats exactly what happens
[1:10:36] <+ThatGuyfromMars> @SolverCODO 1 is Pat's fault, 2 is Paige's fault
[1:10:37] <ShreddingPixels> no but do it right tho
[1:10:37] <+timblenaut> you're telling steph how to play though
[1:10:46] <derap41> I'm wrong! Not what @ThatGuyfromMars !!
[1:10:47] <Sonicdy> EVICIRATED
[1:10:48] <zeroraider> USE manual
[1:10:49] <+MagickBurritoh> as long as you spare him it's pacifist right?
[1:10:56] <stellar_flare> You're doing what Liam did to you man, relying on bad knowledge to advise someone, c'mon.
[1:10:59] <dsauce999> TFW Woolie plays suboptimally NotLikeThis
[1:11:00] <Riverinah> you can't wash your hands of this sin
[1:11:08] <derap41> no meta gaming
[1:11:10] <vVAstrAVv> dont call him a monster or woolie will kill you. fuck your kid lol
[1:11:21] <LandOfTheWay> don't sweat it; just do it how you wanna
[1:11:24] <waterstealer> it's just keep sparing till its over
[1:11:29] <%GohanEgret> in this game, it's fine
[1:11:29] <NoireRequiem> yoooo!
[1:11:36] <+MagickBurritoh> oh my fuck
[1:11:41] <odd_slater> Why do people get so antys when it comes to these games? lol
[1:11:43] <hntronium> iirc Pat and Paige got the pacifist run in
[1:11:44] <+SolverCODO> Woolie why would you assume there's no pascifict route in and undertake sequel
[1:11:54] <mayorrev> thank u ralsei
[1:12:14] <Aquaczaz> going for Jevil after?
[1:12:21] <+MagickBurritoh> new dialogue means progress
[1:12:23] <waterstealer> yeeee
[1:12:26] <%GohanEgret> @odd_slater it's a well-intentioned but obsessive desire to watch others see what they saw
[1:12:34] <waterstealer> thats true
[1:12:35] <stellar_flare> This King didn't though
[1:12:37] <waterstealer> but i mean
[1:12:42] <waterstealer> in the true pacifist
[1:12:44] <mayorrev> close one

[1:12:50] <matouci> I mean there's the whole them of "your choices don't matter" that's been going on to think about too
[1:12:50] <odd_slater> @GohanEgret Yeah
[1:13:05] <%TeethMuncher> @odd_slater cause half the time the people already know what's coming so they're just spinning their wheels hoping things move forward

[1:13:09] <mankeyfigh> Real talk, there is a pacifist route
[1:13:10] <%king_wragles> Might wanna heal
[1:13:13] <DonatelloJose> \ Kreygasm / You can do it
[1:13:19] <+skizzuto> dual heal seems like a good idea

[1:13:32] <@Moobot> 324 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[1:13:37] <odd_slater> I always see it the most with Undertale and Deltarune
[1:13:41] <waterstealer> aww
[1:13:42] <+mans51> do it da- mom
[1:13:49] <+DeaconBluesClues> ...what knight?
[1:13:49] <waterstealer> did anyone see tthat item use animation
[1:13:51] <+ThatGuyfromMars> because the undertale fandom is weird
[1:13:53] <+SuichiTanaka> Let Punch Family play it as they will. Even failure is part of the experience.
[1:14:04] <%GohanEgret> @odd_slater chat was going insane when paige played undertale, had to put it on slow or sub mode just to get through it
[1:14:09] <waterstealer> see
[1:14:14] <derap41> @ThatGuyfromMars that's an under statement
[1:14:19] <mayorrev> chat is wrong again
[1:14:25] <+ThatGuyfromMars> @derap41 I see what you did there
[1:14:29] <odd_slater> @GohanEgret I never got to catch her streams lol
[1:14:29] <Divryne> Kill em all nerd.
[1:14:30] <Divryne> LUL
[1:14:31] <+SolverCODO> Undertale fandom is weird because of all the anime and furry appeal
[1:14:36] <waterstealer> we said he could be pacified
[1:14:41] <firmlygraspi1> come here and touch my creepy stomach tongue
[1:14:48] <+ThatGuyfromMars> @GohanEgret only for the last two streams of that game, otherwise chat wasn't any worse than normal
[1:14:49] <+MagickBurritoh> Now kill him while he's at his weakest
[1:14:50] <mankeyfigh> Woolie, you can still get mercy the king in Undertale later if u did all the side stuff
[1:14:56] <%ChoculaUltra> now give him the succ
[1:14:57] <NoireRequiem> he has a double frown
[1:15:01] <+Answer_Moose> I never understood the appeal of these undertale games.
[1:15:05] <derap41> @SolverCODO kinda its own fault when it panders to it
[1:15:10] <mankeyfigh> Red Buster is also doing damage
[1:15:15] <waterstealer> STEF THE PROPHET
[1:15:18] <%GohanEgret> @ThatGuyfromMars from what I remember, it was nuts from the start since she had like double the normal viewers for it
[1:15:51] <+DeaconBluesClues> my burning soul is not full of vigor. it is full of frienship. my youthful soul is full of friend
[1:15:58] <+kiiiirsten> @ThatGuyfromMars I just scrolled up and saw "the undertale fandom is weird" and had a sensible chuckle LUL
[1:15:58] <%ChoculaUltra> I've always felt that Undertale seems to appeal to people who had socializing problems growing up. But that's just me.
[1:16:02] <+ThatGuyfromMars> @GohanEgret Really? I remember differently, but it was also two years ago lol so I may be misremembering
[1:16:09] <T_Sasquatch> @Answer_Moose imagine if tumblr was endearing and cute but deep in its own way, good music and interesting turn based mechanics with good characters and writing in general

[2:16:58] <%Keyd00d> White is godlike

[2:17:11] <%Klefth> Artificial mango flavor is the worst thing humanity has ever created though
[2:17:12] <hntronium> @iwishthiswasicq Then you missed the good stuff at the end of her stream where woolie was taking way too long to start. She wanted to raid him hard too, so she stayed in the cube for a bit longer

[2:18:37] <$jobbedbone> don't dox yourself like this
[2:18:37] <LegendCobra> orange is garbage
[2:18:41] <%Klefth> Orange is one of the best when it's actually orange. But if it's "mango" it's just THE WORST.
[2:18:41] <%iwishthiswasicq> Huh. Maybe it was longer than I thought.
[2:18:41] <+CJett92> Orange is never the best, but it IS always top tier
[2:18:41] <NoireRequiem> Coke Slushie tho! Best Flavour
[2:18:51] <+Proxzo> Coke Slushie 4 lyfe!
[2:18:53] <+critfumble_> cola is the goat

[3:15:31] <Silent_Fyraena> Did you flush the toilet a lot before?
[3:15:32] <+TheImmortal70> One potentially doesn't exist
[3:15:36] <+Grayhammatter> two friends PogChamp
[3:15:38] <derap41> Mom who in this town haven't you fucked?
[3:15:38] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> more than i have :)
[3:15:38] <alexandrecau> don'T count him
[3:15:41] <simulationbard> That's a 400% increase
[3:15:50] <%TeethMuncher> That's infinitely more friends than 0
[3:16:02] <simulationbard> or however math works
[3:16:08] <waterstealer> it's a leitmotif
[3:16:18] <%Hammerknife> that's a weird looking tv. why is it a box shape and not flat?
[3:16:21] <NoireRequiem> woof
[3:16:22] <+skizzuto> it's the undertale main theme leitmotif
[3:16:24] <GandhiTheTerrible> or the whole leitmotif for undertale
[3:16:24] <+cvp5127> its like the 50th version
[3:16:25] <waterstealer> the music exists in diffetrent forms
[3:16:26] <+NiktenKing> It's a leitmotif of the main theme
[3:16:36] <Thirtine> its both leimotifs from UT and DR
[3:16:40] <+NiktenKing> it's used everywhere in Undertale
[3:16:40] <+JustToWatch> the best stardew valley mod is the one that puts undertale music into the game
[3:16:45] <derap41> best song in the game imho
[3:16:45] <%GohanEgret> @Hammerknife well, young whipper snapper, let me tell ya about old people TVs
[3:16:47] <%TeethMuncher> @Hammerknife old tvs were box shaped
[3:16:58] <%MightyMaxT> The mixing of themes is one of my favorite things about Undertale, tbh
[3:17:06] <sir_nack> also, the main menu music in undertale is hope and dreams, and more of the instruments fill in as you progress through the game
[3:17:07] <+NiktenKing> It's like in all of the songs to a degree
[3:17:08] <GandhiTheTerrible> HIM
[3:17:10] <Laironx3> HIM
[3:17:17] <waterstealer> OH NOOOO

[3:19:45] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Sans Undertales his way to Smash
[3:19:45] <@Menitta> Sans and Doomguy are the two hills
[3:19:47] <hassanico> NO IT WOULDNT YOU FUCKERS
[3:19:50] <%TeethMuncher> Obama for Smash
[3:19:50] <shiny_prinny> everyone was expecting sans in smash because the "come back tomorrow" thing
[3:19:51] <+velemi> PAPYRUS WOULD BE BETTER
[3:19:51] <mr_slaide> I can fap to that.
[3:19:51] <weissguard> But how do you make Sans?
[3:19:52] <rearedlogarithm> I think it's going to be a fakeout and Papyrus will be the playable character.
[3:19:53] <+Grayhammatter> sans will DEFINiTELY die on that hill
[3:19:56] <starotter70> I am going to be so mad if she's right
[3:19:58] <Ion_Laser> Super Smashing Fighters Ultra Infinite EX Plus Third Strike Zero Puzzle Turbo
[3:19:58] <+twohitgood> i'd rather undyne over sans
[3:19:58] <Thirtine> id like undyne!
[3:19:59] <mr_slaide> Sans or Papyrus?
[3:20:03] <hassanico> IT'S SHIT AND TRASH
[3:20:03] <subjectg> Sans and Master Chief confirmed
[3:20:04] <NoireRequiem> plot twist it's just toby fox dog
[3:20:07] <waterstealer> FRITZ
[3:20:08] <drefizz> Undyne likes combat
[3:20:08] <%Ryutaryi> We need UNDYNE
[3:20:09] <LandOfTheWay> fritz?
[3:20:11] <count_bob> PAPYRUS
[3:20:11] <Mr_Taters > My theory is that Sans will be a joke, and it would be Undyne over him
[3:20:14] <Cata_2136> it should be papyrus or GUNDYNE
[3:20:15] <+waltzqueen> Watch it be Chara cause they love to fight!
[3:20:20] <hassanico> FUCK YOU SANS FUCK YOU SANS FUCK YOU
[3:20:23] <Thirtine> sans assist trophy
[3:20:23] <+Risingxiv> Sans would make a great assist trophy
[3:20:23] <mr_slaide> Undyne would fit the fighting mold more.
[3:20:30] <+MetalPanic> if it's anybody it would be Sans assist trophy and undyne character
[3:20:31] <Cdjgamer> sans is a spirt in smash ult
[3:20:34] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Chara is an alt color
[3:20:35] <@Menitta> I'd still prefer Cuphead or Shovel Knight for the indie character but Sans is aight
[3:20:37] <@Solidus_113> If Shovel Knight only gets in as a Assist, ain't NO WAY Sans is getting a fighter slot
[3:20:40] <%Ryutaryi> Her grab would be a suplex before a flex and it'd be awesome.

[3:26:59] <%TeethMuncher> Town vs Knife
[3:26:59] <%MadMan0017> NUTDEALRR
[3:26:59] <%Ryutaryi> They are who we THOUGHT they were
[3:27:00] <televisedrevolting> Okay, but... theories though.
[3:27:01] <Thirtine> YOURE NOT IN CONTROL
[3:27:01] <+skizzuto> Don't forget
[3:27:10] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LOSER
[3:27:11] <%Keyd00d> Now wait 5 more years with everyone else
[3:27:13] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> FREAK
[3:27:14] <%jinking79> welcome to your prison
[3:27:18] <+DeaconBluesClues> WE WERE YOSHIKAGE JR ALL ALONg
[3:27:19] <+rdark_ksu> your the kid everyone expects to blow up
[3:27:20] <zeroraider> and you eat all the chocolate!!
[3:27:20] <+cvp5127> chap 2 in 2020
[3:27:22] <Laironx3> I shouldn't have played this late at night
[3:27:22] <+ThatGuyfromMars> I don't think it'll be 5 years
[3:27:23] <waterstealer> AYY
[3:27:29] <waterstealer> TIME FOR SECRET BO55
[3:27:35] <Laironx3> alone, on my own
[3:27:35] <+waltzqueen> TIME FOR CHAOS
[3:27:35] <LandOfTheWay> chapter 2, hopefully coming in our lifetime
[3:27:40] <Thirtine> youve been controlling kris the whole time
[3:27:42] <+MetalPanic> if you rearrange the letters in "KRIS" you get "CHARA" if you screw up really bad
[3:27:44] <@Solidus_113> time for puzzles to find the key pieces
[3:27:45] <+DeaconBluesClues> PUNCH THAT FUCKIN CLOWN
[3:27:45] <misterrez> I'm really excited for this game's completion to see where it goes with the representation of Kris' weirdness and being an outcast, alongside his teenage resentment towards everything seemingly being this version of Chara.
[3:27:46] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> I CAN DO ANYTHING
[3:27:46] <Thirtine> and they didnt like that
[3:27:48] <Cata_2136> CHOAS CHAOS
[3:27:54] <waterstealer> but chara is older
[3:27:54] <gespenst_mr_ghost> Now all we have to do is wait....and wait..........and wait
[3:27:56] <%GohanEgret> @WoolieVersus that's why Noelle's dad chides you for scaring Noelle for being under her bed, and why Noelle is creeped out by the blood on the arm "joke" by Kris
[3:27:57] <+Sendaar> Didn't Toby say ch.2 is at least 7 years from when this came out?
[3:27:58] <misterrez> That or whatever crazy thing Toby Fox does.
[3:28:00] <Laironx3> Ligmers
[3:28:05] <televisedrevolting> My favorite interpretation is that Kris is just a weird child being inhabited by the player. That ending bit is them telling you to Fuck Off because they don't want to adventure.
[3:28:10] <Maxpainx10000> CHAOS Chaos
[3:28:10] <+TheImmortal70> He said the full game could take anywhere from 3-7 years, or 1000
[3:28:13] <Silent_Fyraena> Toby Fox says a lot of thing
[3:28:14] <waterstealer> @Sendaar oh god please no
[3:28:17] <$jobbedbone> ITS LIKE POETRY, they RHYME
[3:28:21] <Silent_Fyraena> things*
[3:28:24] <NoireRequiem> so before ff7 remake
[3:28:24] <@Solidus_113> What toby basically said is same characters you know, in a different scenario
[3:28:26] <%DedlokPM> @Sendaar if he does it completely by himself, yes. But he is getting a team together to do it faster
[3:28:29] <Thirtine> toby has barely even STARTED the rest
[3:28:38] <%TeethMuncher> @WoolieVersus Kris just needs to learn the spin to stop Chara
[3:28:43] <+skizzuto> there's a couple things in undertale that hint at possible connections to deltarune
[3:28:46] <+DeaconBluesClues> @Solidus_113 so castle super beast at rooster teeth is basically deltarune
[3:28:49] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> D4C
[3:28:54] <+TheImmortal70> He recently said that he's well through chapter 2, so it's coming along
[3:28:54] <waterstealer> SANS SAID IM GOING TO GRILLBYS
[3:28:55] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Sans is Funny Valentine
[3:28:55] <+NiktenKing> Yes they are... The Switch version that they released just a month before has unique dialog that teased the connection
[3:28:56] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> Absolute k-os...that requires Patience...right Woolie? 😂
[3:29:00] <+Sendaar> Hey as far as I'm concerned Toby can take all the time he needs
[3:29:02] <misterrez> That's wrong. Sans doesn't access multiple timelines, he's just aware that's possible to do.
[3:29:06] <+DeaconBluesClues> @WoolieVersus oh man is deltarune just jojo part 8
[3:29:07] <+NiktenKing> Of Undertale Switch rather
[3:29:17] <derap41> Sans is the rick of undertale
[3:29:19] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Sans took the first napkin
[3:29:19] <misterrez> The player and Flowey were the only ones capable of doing that.
[3:29:19] <waterstealer> SANS SHOP IS GRILLBYS
[3:29:22] <Cdjgamer> you are doppio
[3:29:28] <SailingSaturn> A Game Theory!
[3:29:28] <+twohitgood> sans could be playing dumb
[3:29:30] <+TheImmortal70> Sans stole fuckin Grillby's shop
[3:29:31] <waterstealer> SANS SAID IM GOING TO GRILLBYS
[3:29:31] <ManOfReason> sans is a fixed point in time
[3:29:31] <sir_nack> I think it's also interesting to note that Toby started making Deltarune a long time ago, and Undertale was basically a weird sorta spinoff side thing from it
[3:29:34] <+MetalPanic> sans works like 20 jobs anyway
[3:29:35] <subjectg> Also wanna note that it's likely that this is actually before undertale
[3:29:43] <shiny_prinny> weren't everyones personalities the same?
[3:29:44] <Thirtine> CHAOS time
[3:29:47] <waterstealer> SPIRE
[3:29:51] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Hero shot
[3:29:53] <starotter70> Oooooh
[3:29:55] <Graxe_> Steppenwolf
[3:30:01] <+Grayhammatter> the hero shot
[3:30:01] <+waltzqueen> I CAN DO ANYTHING
[3:30:09] <+cvp5127> did they get all the pieces?
[3:30:12] <+TheImmortal70> Super boss time
[3:30:15] <waterstealer> TIME TO FIND THE KEYS
[3:30:20] <%DashXero> DashXero subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Neat.
[3:30:20] <korsablade> Yay Super boss time
[3:30:22] <%GohanEgret> @shiny_prinny basically, just their professions changed, except for Toriel I think
[3:30:23] <sir_nack> this'll take a bit if they dont use a guide
[3:30:28] <ManOfReason> so is deltarune the main timeline
[3:30:35] <waterstealer> violent expression lol
[3:30:36] <PkSilent01> CHAOS CHAOS
[3:30:39] <subjectg> they already found the hardest key part so it should be no prob
[3:30:45] <waterstealer> you had autosprint on
[3:30:47] <@Solidus_113> check your key pieces to see what you're missing, give the cake back, and load up on healing items
[3:30:59] <waterstealer> ^
[3:31:15] <mankeyfigh> @woolieversus You should definitely buy weapons to increase attack, or you’re going to have a bad time
[3:31:35] <waterstealer> look up a guide for the key pieces
[3:31:36] <MelBrooksKA> Solidus is the hero we don't deserve
[3:31:39] <waterstealer> theyre hard to find
[3:31:51] <@Solidus_113> Dark Burgers from Seam's shop are your best bet for healing
[3:31:54] <%king_wragles> I think Paige managed to find them quick
[3:32:00] <misterrez> You can do the fight without attacking,
[3:32:03] <+Toa697> they arnt that hard to find
[3:32:13] <zepelinnn> yeah, you dont need ATK
[3:32:14] <+Sendaar> This song is such a banger
[3:32:15] <+Toa697> so just go to seam and he will tell you hints
[3:32:16] <%king_wragles> I don't remember if it was an accident or not
[3:32:20] <QaizerArt> @Solidus_113 Ask if maybe he wants the guide to find the key pieces?
[3:32:24] <MelBrooksKA> Brave Ax! You could attack like 4 times with that spyCappa
[3:32:34] <SirSmudgey> @WoolieVersus you can fight or be pacifist. Fighting earns a weapon, Pacify earns armor.
[3:32:36] <+skizzuto> glowshard can be sold, it's otherwise useless
[3:32:40] <QaizerArt> Cause A and C are a bit of a pain in the ass
[3:32:51] <+twohitgood> you get different rewards for doing a fight vs doing a pacifist win.
[3:32:55] <%DedlokPM> @WoolieVersus Glowshard is purely for selling
[3:33:00] <misterrez> @WoolieVersus Actually, whether you do the fight by attacking or not defines what reward you get when you win.
[3:33:05] <Laironx3> You have to go to Seam's for the next key fragment anyway
[3:33:22] <QaizerArt> @WoolieVersus Glowshard can be sold, ClubsSandwich is a good multi-heal item to have a couple of.
[3:33:28] <+twohitgood> iirc, i think doing the fight is supposed to be harder?
[3:34:07] <QaizerArt> @WoolieVersus Do you want to know where the other Key Pieces are to speed things up?
[3:34:07] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[3:34:17] <sir_nack> stop by the shop!
[3:34:17] <%MightyMaxT> Man, this song still rules
[3:34:33] <+skizzuto> ^
[3:34:46] <@Solidus_113> Toby can't not make banger tracks
[3:34:49] <QaizerArt> This song is unequivocally one of the best besides Rude Buster
[3:34:58] <waterstealer> toby is a composer at heart
[3:35:01] <sosuke5> HOW CAN THIS BE
[3:35:27] <waterstealer> can you run?
[3:35:33] <+orion_248> Has there been any new news regarding this game? I played Deltarune last Halloween but I haven't heard much besides the switch release.
[3:35:44] <@Solidus_113> nothing
[3:35:44] <waterstealer> no news that i know of
[3:36:08] <+skizzuto> toby tweeted that he was making progress on chapter 2 but otherwise no news
[3:36:34] <%king_wragles> @orion_248 it's a "it's done when it's done" kind of deal, except we aren't even sure if Toby is working on the next one yet
[3:36:36] <waterstealer> god knows how long thatll taje
[3:36:41] <waterstealer> aw man
[3:36:49] <waterstealer> LOL
[3:37:01] <waterstealer> LUL
[3:37:05] <%king_wragles> It'll take anywhere between tomorrow and 10 years from now, in regards to the next game
[3:37:06] <sir_nack> speen
[3:37:07] <kingra> WORSE healing item get!!!
[3:37:08] <waterstealer> i love this guy
[3:37:12] <+JohnMarkley> good evening everyone :) /
[3:37:23] <+orion_248> At least we know it's getting worked on according to that tweet. I'm hoping we'll hear something around October.
[3:37:39] <+orion_248> Like, every Halloween we get a new chapter?
[3:37:40] <waterstealer> you can get a new one whenever you want
[3:37:43] <%king_wragles> This track is the best Deltarune track, FIGHT ME
[3:37:53] <waterstealer> secet boss one is better
[3:37:55] <@Solidus_113> to Seam's shop, he'll have something to talk about
[3:37:58] <%MightyMaxT> No need to fight. Its true
[3:37:59] <+Terrabyte0> SO it's basically a Soma?
[3:38:02] <+Toa697> seam will tell you where
[3:38:04] <+doc_ock_rokc> @king_wragles why should i fight you your right
[3:38:05] <mankeyfigh> @king_wragles put ‘em up

[3:40:20] <%GeneralSCPatton> GeneralSCPatton subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Hey Woolz. Finally caught you live when you were doing something I care about, but Twitch notifications have failed me. I am now condemned to live 3 hours in the past, in Vod Land.
[3:40:21] <misterrez> To be fair, it was way too obvious. It's the most cunning of disguises.

[3:41:08] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:41:10] <mankeyfigh> Nani!? You were the one...
[3:41:11] <%king_wragles> wait.... WAIT
[3:41:16] <waterstealer> @sir_nack oh shit it is
[3:41:18] <%king_wragles> This is a remix of World Revolving!
[3:41:19] <@Solidus_113> you already have that piece
[3:41:44] <@Solidus_113> the last one is behind the Great Board, way closer to the start of the game
[3:42:07] <Silent_Fyraena> If you take the Spookysword to the real world, it turns into the Halloween Pencil.
[3:42:14] <Silent_Fyraena> Or something like that
[3:42:15] <waterstealer> you dont have to kill secret boss
[3:42:20] <+slaugaus> is this not a remix of rude buster?
[3:42:26] <QaizerArt> @Solidus_113 Isn't it the Card Puzzle that you can get to by going north from the Infinity Forest's exit screen?
[3:42:48] <waterstealer> the part that asks what the order of the suits in the castle are
[3:43:05] <waterstealer> i think rouxls's axe is good
[3:43:06] <sir_nack> you could always do nonlethal
[3:43:11] <+Toa697> you are probably fine on weapons, esp if you dont plan on attacking
[3:43:37] <@Solidus_113> 30 to team is worth keeping
[3:43:41] <SirSmudgey> You can throw away the manual
[3:43:54] <+skizzuto> the ??? healing items heal a varying amount depending on which character you use them on (different characters have different tastes)
[3:43:54] <+Toa697> question marks do different healing for different party members
[3:43:55] <waterstealer> sell roux, keep sandwich
[3:44:09] <QaizerArt> @WoolieVersus Get rid of everything but SpinCake, ReviveMint, ClubsSandwich and DarkBurger
[3:44:11] <waterstealer> @skizzuto didnt know thats how that worked
[3:44:16] <@Solidus_113> the red and black checkerboard
[3:44:18] <%GeneralSCPatton> Does Woolz read subs and donations throughout the stream, or in a massive chunk like Pat and Paige?
[3:44:30] <waterstealer> he did a while ago
[3:44:31] <QaizerArt> @WoolieVersus Have her buy another Clubs Sandwich and fill the rest of inventory with DarkBurgers
[3:44:38] <%TeethMuncher> @GeneralSCPatton chunk
[3:44:46] <waterstealer> LUL
[3:44:47] <caol2017> MonkaS
[3:44:51] <+waltzqueen> Pfft
[3:44:57] <%king_wragles> @slaugaus it could be a remix of Rude Buster. I'm pretty tired right now and shouldn't be listened to
[3:45:26] <Laironx3> Now how do you go to the giant checkerboard from here? I don't quite remember.
[3:45:34] <QaizerArt> Hey, @Solidus_113 can I PM you?
[3:45:46] <waterstealer> you can wear 2
[3:45:46] <mankeyfigh> Chat what in the world does monkas mean?
[3:45:47] <MasterTonberry23> This Woolie's first time?
[3:45:58] <@Solidus_113> don't see why not
[3:45:59] <waterstealer> not woolies first
[3:46:06] <%king_wragles> @MasterTonberry23 no, but it's Punch mom's first run
[3:46:08] <waterstealer> woolie didnt do secret boss tho
[3:46:10] <%DedlokPM> @MasterTonberry23 it's his first time for secret boss.
[3:46:11] <+skizzuto> @MasterTonberry23 it's not his first time playing but it's his first time seeing the secret boss
[3:46:17] <@Solidus_113> MonkaS is a BetterTwitch emote
[3:46:25] <waterstealer> ragger is good for damage on ralsei
[3:46:43] <%king_wragles> I'd imagine there's different ways to do the fight tho
[3:46:52] <+skizzuto> no great board is later in the game
[3:46:58] <SirSmudgey> She didn't buy the amber
[3:47:11] <@Solidus_113> if you plan on attacking the secret boss, Ragger is good, but if you're going pacifist you'll need the healing bonus
[3:47:23] <+Toa697> why would you!
[3:47:35] <caol2017> 3
[3:47:37] <+Toa697> its later
[3:47:37] <waterstealer> solidus wrong
[3:47:39] <+TheImmortal70> The great board is literally at the end of the Forest
[3:47:40] <+skizzuto> it's near the start of the game but after seams shop
[3:47:44] <@Solidus_113> I'll load up the game right now to double check
[3:47:46] <+TheImmortal70> Before the foreset
[3:47:51] <%TeethMuncher> Great board is in game confirmed
[3:47:52] <+TheImmortal70> After the plains
[3:47:56] <+TheImmortal70> Or whatever the hell the first area is
[3:47:56] <jessekarger> It's inbetween the field and the great board aka to the right
[3:47:59] <%king_wragles> ugh, my stream died and wouldn't refresh for a minute
[3:47:59] <+Piejumper5814> the board is literally the next area
[3:48:03] <Laironx3> Ah the great checkerboard is before the forest definitely
[3:48:03] <%king_wragles> did we get anywhere?
[3:48:06] <sir_nack> isnt the key at that early area with the dancing fellas? and you gotta walk off the path
[3:48:08] <waterstealer> same
[3:48:08] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[4:01:35] <waterstealer> WAIT DID SHE SAVE
[4:01:36] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @woolieversus two ways, each gives a different item
[4:01:41] <QaizerArt> SHIT, THEY DIDN'T SAVE
[4:01:43] <sir_nack> @waterstealer yes
[4:01:47] <+NarcissistCactus> save state
[4:01:47] <+skizzuto> pirouette gives an effect based on what turn number you're on, iirc
[4:01:49] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @woolieversus neither will ruin your ending btw.
[4:01:51] <+Noxybaru> Pacifist might even be easier. Though you're gonna have a bad fucking time regardless

[4:02:54] <NazakYuzak> is this the only fight that brings your team to negative HP? or is that how it's always been
[4:02:55] <+velemi> he can do anything, Woolie!
[4:02:56] <Youwereeatenbyalid> It's the sound of CHAOS
[4:02:57] <QaizerArt> She was actually doing pretty alright!
[4:02:58] <+DeaconBluesClues> Jevil is the Devil/Joker: the one card you have to remove from the deck.
[4:02:59] <+korth367> BUT CAN HE DO NOTHING?
[4:03:01] <lozovalazo1> That's a wonderful idea
[4:03:06] <QaizerArt> @NazakYuzak That's how it's always been.
[4:03:08] <sir_nack> @NazakYuzak thats just how health works
[4:03:09] <+Toa697> how its always been @NazakYuzak
[4:03:13] <shiny_prinny> i love the amount of work on this secret boss
[4:03:18] <SirSmudgey> @WoolieVersus Team heal is king fight only
[4:03:18] <QaizerArt> It's just unlikely to get to negative HP outside of last boss and secret boss.

[4:04:13] <+Toa697> gotta use pirouette and hypnosis to tire him out
[4:04:15] <waterstealer> you'll get nowhere if you dont tire him out
[4:04:20] <+DeaconBluesClues> OH FUCK
[4:04:22] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @woolieversus it is NOT AN ENDURANCE RUN
[4:04:24] <17sevens> Uh, Woolie, maybe don't talk about things you don't actually know about?

[4:04:32] <+NarcissistCactus> nice
[4:04:33] <Youwereeatenbyalid> this is unfortunate
[4:04:33] <MarylandJutsu> Chaos CHAOS
[4:04:37] <Them00n> @WoolieVersus You have to put him to sleep.
[4:04:41] <sir_nack> @WoolieVersus if you're doing pacifist, you gotta use hypnosis to make him tired
[4:04:44] <+NarcissistCactus> you can totally just wait it out
[4:04:45] <mankeyfigh> CHAOS
[4:04:47] <+velemi> CHAOS CHAOS
[4:04:49] <+NarcissistCactus> it just takes longer
[4:04:50] <waterstealer> yeah its not an endurance run
[4:04:52] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @woolieversus need to use team move hypnosis to tire him out
[4:05:03] <NazakYuzak> No idea how I managed to beat this on the first try. ridiculous fight lol
[4:05:07] <+Toa697> pirouette also tires
[4:05:07] <+TheImmortal70> Basically you either do a safe hypnosis, or be meter efficient with Pirouette
[4:05:16] <mankeyfigh> defend
[4:05:29] <%GeneralSCPatton> Doesn't waiting him out take 30 turns? Way longer than it should take to kill or sleep him.
[4:05:30] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @woolieversus waiting it out will NOT work
[4:05:34] <+Noxybaru> Hypnosis is what you really want to use
[4:05:40] <Youwereeatenbyalid> take it from me, I learned the hard way
[4:05:44] <NazakYuzak> Pirouette has an effect based on what turn it is. also has negative effects
[4:05:44] <waterstealer> USE SANDWICH
[4:05:53] <sir_nack> yeah so try to save meter for hypnosis
[4:05:56] <+Toa697> You actually cant just wait it out GeneralSCPatton
[4:06:11] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Hang around the edges
[4:06:21] <%laserbeaming> I thought Pirouette was not random, but had a specific effect each turn? There was a turn that always healed you if you use Pirouette IIRC
[4:06:24] <waterstealer> they need to be up
[4:06:25] <sir_nack> you also have two dead teammates
[4:06:27] <+MagickBurritoh> 2 are DEAD
[4:06:28] <%king_wragles> THEY DED
[4:06:36] <+TheImmortal70> Don't worry, everything is going fine
[4:06:44] <+Piejumper5814> Susie: fuck this I'm eating a burger before I die
[4:06:46] <KahtaLzargo> Mmmm a Whataburger ad. Nice intro.
[4:06:58] <waterstealer> i always have trouble with that
[4:07:30] <sosuke5> strong
[4:07:31] <mankeyfigh> Mmm... that CHAOS smells good
[4:07:33] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @woolieversus There are three ways to defeat Jevil: Fully deplete Jevil's HP Tire Jevil using Pirouette and Hypnosis, then cast Pacify Tire Jevil by being on Phase 5 and on turn #30+, then cast Pacify
[4:07:36] <QaizerArt> YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

[4:08:47] <%GeneralSCPatton> Good luck lasting 30 turns
[4:08:53] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Also @waterstealer taken straight from the wiki. After pat playing Vampire and New Vegas, I've learned to just google search and be sure.
[4:08:57] <weissguard> Meanwhile, Jevil is having a BLAST
[4:09:06] <Youwereeatenbyalid> He's also apparently got 5 distinct phases
[4:09:13] <waterstealer> huh. maybe i should go back and try it again
[4:09:16] <+waltzqueen> Pirroette
[4:09:22] <shiny_prinny> i think you auto lose pacifist now, just go till death i guess

[4:10:01] <jotabranded> Did you watch last JoJo episode @WoolieVersus ?
[4:10:06] <+Piejumper5814> don't get hit

[4:10:07] <shiny_prinny> ralsei needs to be up to win though right?
[4:10:08] <Laironx3> ded
[4:10:08] <+waltzqueen> Mortis!
[4:10:08] <+skizzuto> @king_wragles it's the manual, they're out of healing items
[4:10:11] <waterstealer> f
[4:10:13] <%GeneralSCPatton> The only HP that matters
[4:10:14] <zeroraider> oof
[4:10:14] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @woolieversus are we having a bad time yet?
[4:10:15] <sir_nack> first of many
[4:10:17] <+velemi> m o r t i s
[4:10:18] <Thirtine> GG
[4:10:19] <mankeyfigh> YOTE
[4:10:19] <bevyrage> ralsei needs to be up to pacify yes
[4:10:21] <caol2017> pretty good 1st go
[4:10:21] <%king_wragles> @skizzuto I know, I was being a shit
[4:10:22] <starotter70> Not bad
[4:10:26] <+arcturusblade> That far on the first run? Damn.
[4:10:28] <+skizzuto> ah
[4:10:31] <QaizerArt> @WoolieVersus Dude she did AMAZINGLY for the first run.
[4:10:34] <+waltzqueen> Tale 2!
[4:10:35] <mankeyfigh> Did they save?
[4:10:35] <+Terrabyte0> That was just a practice round
[4:10:39] <+NarcissistCactus> something something touhou
[4:10:41] <Youwereeatenbyalid> That was legitimately impressive
[4:10:48] <mankeyfigh> Aight
[4:10:50] <Thirtine> its hard any way
[4:10:52] <+Toa697> no its not
[4:10:55] <NazakYuzak> passive is easier imo
[4:10:57] <zepelinnn> no woolie, 30 turns if you just wait
[4:10:58] <+korth367> fighting is also just as hard
[4:11:01] <+NarcissistCactus> 30 if she does nothing
[4:11:03] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @woolieversus or use Hypnosis to tire out
[4:11:05] <+korth367> it makes no difference
[4:11:06] <waterstealer> save now so you dont have to deal with dialogue
[4:11:08] <%laserbeaming> I think they meant maximum 30 turns
[4:11:09] <+skizzuto> it's less than 30 if you use hypnosis
[4:11:14] <sir_nack> @WoolieVersus you dont need to do the 30 turns, thats just if you do nothing. using hypnosis makes it faster
[4:11:15] <subjectg> this is not the sans fight, this is doable either way using hypnosis
[4:11:21] <waterstealer> oooooooooooh
[4:11:22] <shiny_prinny> minimum or maximum 30?
[4:11:22] <mankeyfigh> Chat let’s keep count of Turns
[4:11:25] <waterstealer> that maes sense
[4:11:29] <+Toa697> max 30
[4:11:30] <Thirtine> OP OP
[4:11:34] <+waltzqueen> Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
[4:11:35] <+DeaconBluesClues> Jevil with the crossups
[4:11:38] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @woolieversus by using hypnosis rather
[4:11:38] <%TeethMuncher> ohp
[4:11:38] <+NarcissistCactus> oh
[4:11:40] <subjectg> 30 turns of waiting is much more work, and pretty boring as well
[4:11:40] <mankeyfigh> Turn 1
[4:11:41] <PkSilent01> passive is at most 10 turn if you always use hypnosis
[4:12:04] <mankeyfigh> Turn 2
[4:12:25] <mankeyfigh> Turn 3
[4:12:27] <odd_slater> I still gotta fight this boss
[4:12:35] <odd_slater> Forgot about him lol
[4:12:49] <+Toa697> the strats for this fight are complicated
[4:12:52] <zepelinnn> CHOKE
[4:12:56] <+Toa697> really hard to figure out whats best
[4:12:59] <%king_wragles> Just breathe
[4:13:04] <mankeyfigh> Turn 4
[4:13:11] <starotter70> Nah, backseat harder
[4:13:12] <Run44forrest> Mind goblins
[4:13:16] <+FloorBurger> Secret Discord Tech discussion over here
[4:13:18] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @woolieversus hey turns out that the "Random" effect of pirroute isn't random, it' depends on your turn
[4:13:23] <Prism_Wing> My mind keeps going "Just dodgeroll!"
[4:13:23] <mankeyfigh> Turn 5
[4:13:36] <odd_slater> Did Woolie say "DARK METAMORPHOSIS"?
[4:14:03] <mankeyfigh> Turn 6
[4:14:07] <+DeaconBluesClues> feed that goat like 10 burgers
[4:14:08] <+waltzqueen> The attacks actualy evole and strat tracking, the longer you survive
[4:14:24] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @woolieversus pirrouette on turns 2, 4, 6, and 9 are benificial. 7 swaps hp, and other turns do nothing or buff Jevil.
[4:14:31] <+NarcissistCactus> the bomb is gonna be a bitch
[4:14:39] <mankeyfigh> Turn 7
[4:15:07] <%laserbeaming> Yeah, I remembered it not being random
[4:15:10] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @woolieversus "WE GOT TECH" -you.
[4:15:13] <waterstealer> thats some tech
[4:15:20] <mankeyfigh> Turn 8
[4:15:20] <subjectg> you're really better off doing it legit really
[4:15:30] <LandOfTheWay> christ, wish i'd known that when i did this fight

[4:15:37] <mankeyfigh> Turn 9

[4:15:59] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @woolieversus pirrouete for group heal
[4:16:14] <%king_wragles> noooooo
[4:16:15] <+Toa697> pirouette also loops its list of effects every 10 turns
[4:16:18] <+waltzqueen> turn 10!
[4:16:18] <Youwereeatenbyalid> welp nvm
[4:16:19] <+velemi> its Everyman!
[4:16:22] <+Toa697> so turn 2 and 12 are the same
[4:16:26] <knyttstories> @WoolieVersus For the spiral spade attack, I found the best way is to move towards the first one that moves, and go around the outside of the spiral as it moves towards the middle

[4:21:55] <sir_nack> you can do it if you react quick enough
[4:21:58] <+NarcissistCactus> you can outcircle it
[4:22:00] <zepelinnn> you can outcircle, but in the middle
[4:22:05] <Youwereeatenbyalid> I'm going to stop spamming until kris is actually up methinks

[4:29:08] <starotter70> @Youwereeatenbyalid I don't think he has enough tp
[4:29:18] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @starotter70 sure enough.
[4:29:28] <ChortlesJ1> So Jevil, Marx, Dimento, and Kefka walk into a bar
[4:29:32] <%TeethMuncher> @WoolieVersus because the carosul's horses are going up and down, you need to do the same. Moving horizontally from the center wastes movement and increases chances of getting hit.
[4:29:40] <mankeyfigh> Turn 10
[4:29:54] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @TeethMuncher holy shit that's scary

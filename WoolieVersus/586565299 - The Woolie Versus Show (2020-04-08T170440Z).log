[0:09:16] <+SpartanDumpster> I want to believe Woolie actually sleeps in the trash pile until each stream
[0:09:22] <DatAsuna> imagine stealing someone's debit card and using it for papa johns of all things
[0:09:26] <%lotharrio> @LeafarOznolam It's normally pretty far, but I think it's probably only a few hours, at this point. Woolie just got locked into further Nar Shadaar shenanigans.

[0:14:42] <jimjamstrawberryslamalam> Ah yes the Samurai diss
[0:14:44] <DatAsuna> @jevichrono not that far actually
[0:14:47] <%Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus I have much in the way pf unsolicited advice, but primarily - Talk to HK-47 some more, and keep him in the party, especially if Greater Goods need to be done. He has fantastic dialogue in his influence tree.

[0:22:30] <Redblood801> Aw man, I can't believe the game crashed again Kappa
[0:22:31] <zocano> Like my first playthrough of Dragon Age Origins seeing most of it was only 40 hours and I have heard a similar 70 hour number from ppl for their first playthroughs of that
[0:22:32] <legacy0117> Droid Inquisitionnnn!
[0:22:36] <+Bluemanzee> Wooleave?
[0:22:42] <%jiggy_snipe> i think you just left
[0:22:43] <%andrei11dr> But there are a lot of HK encounters in this game
[0:22:46] <grandark_z317> @cisealnine this is more Mandom's power than KC.
[0:22:46] <%jiggy_snipe> it didnt show it
[0:22:49] <%lotharrio> I think Mira told you where to find him so you went there, solo.
[0:22:50] <DRAGKUDO> who the hell is that?
[0:22:56] <%Gruhunchously> He's good against droids
[0:23:00] <+kekkerscrew> G0T) is real good
[0:23:00] <petwisk> G0-T0
[0:23:07] <+kekkerscrew> G0-T0
[0:23:07] <candidateplays> I think you need to talk to him on the ship to get his influence.
[0:23:07] <legacy0117> Watch them be there sgain.
[0:23:19] <StarlitStunner> He is such a corpulent sphere
[0:23:22] <%lotharrio> Level 18 is the final part for Handmaiden.
[0:23:22] <yeetdabsenpai69> when does woolie read messages?
[0:23:23] <zocano> You never need Goto in your party
[0:23:31] <derap41> Looking better
[0:23:38] <+evbites> looks like pockets
[0:23:38] <BallerSwagBro9k> Go-To is just Future Pat
[0:23:44] <yeetdabsenpai69> not trying to rush jut making sure
[0:23:51] <%andrei11dr> Sadly most armour looks like shit in this game
[0:23:56] <zocano> I did all Goto content entirely within the Ebon Hawk
[0:23:59] <%SirGO0SE> woolie looking to jetison mira LUL
[0:23:59] <+kekkerscrew> There's an App for that
[0:23:59] <derap41> There is a threesome mod
[0:24:09] <%lotharrio> I woke up at threesome mod.
[0:24:12] <zombie_goasts> A foursome mod
[0:24:14] <+Slimshazbot> game is a bit quiet
[0:24:21] <+Bluemanzee> Wow I never knew this
[0:24:37] <%Gruhunchously> @zocano Fun fact, if Goto is in your party at certain times time bounty hunters come after you, he will tell them that the bounty is recinded and make them stop.
[0:24:44] <+evbites> hk:fuck my life!!!
[0:25:01] <%SirGO0SE> thats rad
[0:25:12] <%lotharrio> It's restored content, yeah.
[0:25:21] <%Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus He does
[0:25:29] <legacy0117> That's pretty detailed and cool.
[0:25:29] <Zouledge> @Gruhunchously been playing this game for years and i never knew that
[0:25:32] <%andrei11dr> You'd think Reeven wouldn't program him with that, since he's a special model
[0:25:36] <%Djinnazz> Game audio is kinda low
[0:25:37] <zocano> @gruhunchously ya I figured that might happen with certain bounty hunter engagements
[0:25:42] <%Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus He has more things to say about them if you ask
[0:26:09] <%SirGO0SE> i think he upped it, sounds fine ya?
[0:26:14] <zocano> Ya there’s no hk dialogue about it
[0:26:17] <zocano> It’s weird
[0:26:30] <zocano> Probably a planned thing that couldn’t make it
[0:26:38] <legacy0117> So, if you need to sneak past HK-models, use HK-kill bot. Essy.
[0:26:47] <legacy0117> easy*

[0:27:21] <%lotharrio> "Make an antisemetic cartoon character. Give it a bizarre Italian accent." -George Lucas, 2003.
[0:27:47] <+Bluemanzee> It's like poetry
[0:28:02] <zocano> I find it odd that low influence for a party member doesn’t shift them to the opposite type of jedi
[0:28:12] <BallerSwagBro9k> @lotharrio Dont u mean 1999?
[0:28:16] <+kekkerscrew> Having party members angry at you unlocks good stuff for them
[0:28:18] <%lotharrio> @zocano Atton has that feature actually.

[0:28:27] <donstylo> DId Woolie the missing daughter quest? This quest had an interesting Kreia line and option to solve the quest.

[0:28:27] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:28:34] <DatAsuna> @zocano well it's low influence, not negative influence
[0:28:35] <+spacehouse> Cheer1500 Regarding your introspection being mislabeled as excuses, goes to the heart of one of humanity's oldest philosophical problems, that no person can truly understand another or objective reality, discussed in the "Tractatus logico philosophicus" and is a central theme in "Wonderful Everyday". A game that is NOT FOR THE FEINT OF HEART OR FEINT OF MIND. Recommend anyone with a taste for philosophical & introspective games to give SubaHibi a try. Especially in these interesting times.
[0:28:38] <a_mad_dragon> this is why i want a mod that gives EVERY character's reactions to a given event, whether they're in your party or not
[0:28:39] <%lotharrio> @BallerSwagBro9k I was gonna look up the exact date, but lost interest.
[0:28:48] <%kyh9> These guys are so fucking racist
[0:28:54] <legacy0117> My character power leveled due to not using teammates. So interesting watching the reactions.
[0:28:55] <zocano> Oh it’s only atton? My bao-dur was still a dark jedi on my low influence dark side playthrough
[0:29:05] <%kyh9> Just, their design looks absurdly like old racist caricatures
[0:29:33] <heartlesshealer> jealously hoard feat points
[0:29:33] <Chisas_Dead_Body> You weren’t level 18 the last time you talked to Handmaiden
[0:29:35] <zocano> Bao dur still gives into hate for dark side but low influence
[0:29:38] <zocano> For example
[0:29:40] <+mighty_max_t> I thought Reggie was the one who looks at feets
[0:29:56] <zocano> Instead of you calming him for light side
[0:29:59] <+evbites> My whole race was derived from nazi propaganda give me coins
[0:30:09] <heartlesshealer> Hmm
[0:30:19] <%lotharrio> Fists are not melee.
[0:30:24] <legacy0117> If you cross reference you can, in fact. Hence why Dejavu exists and halpens...Regardless interesting topic.
[0:30:29] <zocano> Fists are their own category
[0:30:29] <Goodvibes99508> you can get it another way anyway
[0:30:34] <+thatotherblackkid> fists are unarmed
[0:30:37] <%lotharrio> I'm just one guy, but fists are not melee
[0:30:42] <heartlesshealer> so hard DND rules on fists
[0:30:42] <%Gruhunchously> @evbites To be fair (not really but) that kind of racism was hardly limited to the Nazis. The Nazis just took it farther than anyone else.
[0:30:46] <DatAsuna> They're not melee
[0:30:48] <zocano> They do not benefit from melee weapons
[0:30:52] <SlashingIce> Dueling
[0:30:55] <CaptainBright> unarmed specialist is not melee
[0:31:01] <zocano> Same with dueling and two handing
[0:31:03] <carlosmiyamoto> Level 18 dueling
[0:31:03] <nepwar> i think it doesn't count melee since theres a whole feat on punching
[0:31:08] <vulkan_vibes> Dueling!
[0:31:10] <+evbites> true but i though of the joke so ehhh
[0:31:20] <liljojofett> Dueling

[0:32:06] <CaptainBright> but it's now broken
[0:32:12] <zocano> Literally all I spammed on both dark side and light aide
[0:32:13] <+thatotherblackkid> you fixed it but fuck you though
[0:32:36] <zocano> I think it’s to skip around and avoid the center area railroad trigger

[0:33:11] <halfmasks> @lotharrio not too bad thanks
[0:33:13] <%Gruhunchously> The speeder is primarily for influence
[0:33:17] <nepwar> its a bao durr influencer
[0:33:21] <Skullyton175> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:33:27] <zocano> I fucked up on my dark side and hit the main quest super fast before I did really anything on nar shadaa

[0:33:54] <%SirGO0SE> g0t0 hype
[0:33:55] <JaceDarkstar> @woolieversus I did testing on the xbox version you can use the speeder to bypass the trigger for the slavers
[0:33:55] <nepwar> oh i hope theres something
[0:34:05] <dorpork> its a bug
[0:34:09] <heartlesshealer> HMMM
[0:34:13] <dorpork> goto will leave if you enter with him. this is a bug

[0:34:27] <vulkan_vibes> yeah my got left

[0:35:38] <%SirGO0SE> it super video game economy
[0:35:38] <Tucker0603> it's bullshit
[0:35:47] <zocano> Part of it is the loot tables
[0:35:49] <CaptainBright> economy of the videogame
[0:35:53] <restingbones> Oh my god no
[0:35:53] <%jiggy_snipe> its video game economy?
[0:35:54] <%lotharrio> Guns are droids are expensive. But you can probably live off of however much a standard blaster costs.
[0:36:12] <+jake5713> Woolie's used to fillin' them...POCKETSSSS!
[0:36:14] <Ravenian96> Price discrepancy is just going to get worse lol

[0:36:18] <%SirGO0SE> the fucking FGC pays out better than this!

[0:36:21] <+Zanco23> Hard times, because of the dark side
[0:36:22] <+Bluemanzee> At 1st game's level cap, but only 1 planet finished so far. I feel like thi sgame is bigger than I remember
[0:36:24] <%Gruhunchously> Go out and come back it
[0:36:30] <zocano> Swoop racing pays a ton on a later planet
[0:36:35] <CaptainBright> I just did the swoop races of onderon; they give you close to 5 figures worth of credits
[0:36:49] <+MrBaldachin> @Bluemanzee it slows down real hard after 20
[0:36:50] <%andrei11dr> I guess they're ALLL just scamming the fuck out you
[0:36:58] <%SirGO0SE> i mean thats a pretty cool droid..
[0:36:58] <legacy0117> Gotta gamble to earn more during races.
[0:37:03] <%lotharrio> He's like T3 just... more specialized in fighting droids.

[0:38:09] <CaptainBright> G0-T0 is not needed, when you have Darth T3 and HK with you
[0:38:13] <%gasgrave> gasgrave converted from a Twitch Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub! 
[0:38:13] <heartlesshealer> Don't do Nero like that
[0:38:14] <%Gruhunchously> No...no. Goto is Arkham.
[0:38:17] <%fallenangelzelos> Aww didn’t know we started already. What I miss?
[0:38:20] <StarlitStunner> I prefer him to T3 because he actually talks instead of beeps, and as a dark side droid I feel he has synergy with HK
[0:38:26] <%SirGO0SE> i thought that said Droid Thick

[0:38:36] <Sarl109> he can use the zap arm though
[0:38:38] <%lotharrio> He also doesn't set off mines.
[0:38:38] <+Zanco23> @evbites *Goto steps between HK and T3* I'm putting a stop... to this sibling rivalry.
[0:38:41] <Exodusprime1256> statement: SCUM

[0:38:50] <restingbones> Im sitting here, having a good time watching woolie play Star war. And now is the time I learn Bernie officially has dropped out. The day is ruined.
[0:38:52] <Sarl109> G0-t0 does all T3 does but is immune to Mines
[0:38:53] <Daxalog> Why is he so high up on the character view screen? Is it because his model is just animated higher to simulate flight?
[0:38:57] <%lotharrio> But yeah, he's superfluous.
[0:38:58] <Reizie_Etherealm> Observation: This party is getting crazy
[0:38:58] <+Brandon__Brando> someone with more money finish the hype train!
[0:39:06] <Jaku2011> Ya he actually talks which makes him way more interesting to T3 who cares about power the main character is op af
[0:39:09] <+evbites> just put a sheet over goto and push him in the corner like a parrot
[0:39:11] <+MrBaldachin> you can't teach handmaiden and disciple afaik which is sad
[0:39:18] <%fallenangelzelos> Hey chat did I miss anything interesting? Thanks!
[0:39:54] <StarlitStunner> @mrbaldachin GoTo not setting off mines is a mechanic I think obsidian did better later on with ED-E in New Vegas who had the same ability.
[0:39:54] <%Gruhunchously> He' proto Mister House
[0:40:02] <%lotharrio> "Just stop all your fucking magic wars, assholes!"
[0:40:12] <heartlesshealer> man, fuck big money
[0:40:13] <%jiggy_snipe> @fallenangelzelos not really, they fought some HK assassins
[0:40:18] <Tomas2886Cz> @fallenangelzelos nah, you're good

[0:40:24] <zanzibarian_hamster> "moral relativist", not evil.

[0:41:34] <+evbites> i wonder if there has ever been a case where a person was so rich that they had to create a new currency
[0:41:56] <%Gruhunchously> No Sex in the Mandalorian Room
[0:42:01] <%lotharrio> @evbites Basically that's old company towns in the USA.
[0:42:01] <RantingRavager> That currency is TIGERS
[0:42:09] <%lotharrio> I guess Disney dollars, too?
[0:42:21] <zocano> Pretty sure you can just talk to the mandos right now
[0:42:25] <zocano> And just walk away
[0:42:25] <Redblood801> Don't Mando Handle the door
[0:42:27] <+Zanco23> @lotharrio Oh, I could have sworn it was on Nar Shaddaa
[0:42:46] <%lotharrio> @Zanco23 It will be. Just need to do quests on other worlds to unlock it.
[0:42:46] <%fallenangelzelos> Don’t hando the mandos
[0:42:46] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[0:42:48] <%mitchteck> This is the way
[0:42:51] <DatAsuna> That's a high school playground line
[0:42:53] <+MrBaldachin> I was replaying this the other day and I forgot you had to repair the airspeeder before doing goto's ship, I was so sad
[0:42:54] <dorpork> use goto
[0:42:56] <nepwar> yo i heard you like HKs
[0:43:15] <+Brandon__Brando> @evbites there was a guy in ancient times that he was so rich everywhere he travild to he destroyed the economy

[0:43:45] <JetpackMcQuack> Bzzt
[0:43:47] <legacy0117> Tigers and Disney money might actually be worth more than American currency if our market keeps going down the toilet. x.x
[0:43:50] <+Urgoslav> tomatoFear
[0:43:52] <BallerSwagBro9k> Reminds me of that Russian Soldier meme
[0:43:53] <%jiggy_snipe> he rather stare at a wall then wathc this bs

[0:44:03] <+theKingRamses> i wonder if greg saw those guys swan dive into the pit
[0:44:08] <Sapphire_Breeze> "eh murder on streets again"
[0:44:10] <legacy0117> Also more combat.
[0:44:15] <%andrei11dr> "Yo son ,do you wanna play some pazak?"
[0:44:15] <StarlitStunner> Tomato subs stripCop stripGun @urgoslav

[0:44:34] <am_omega> "Oh look at the time, guess they are doing this shit again." - Greg
[0:44:35] <%lotharrio> I didn't check this a-hole's inventory before doing this quest.
[0:44:40] <+wunp_fxs> oh this tool
[0:44:42] <+Bluemanzee> You gotta look hard
[0:44:43] <DatAsuna> there's one in episode 6
[0:44:43] <Redblood801> Rodians CAN have boobs
[0:44:46] <+Bluemanzee> in their pants
[0:44:53] <BallerSwagBro9k> All Rodians look alike to me
[0:44:54] <donstylo> Female Rodians have boobs.
[0:44:56] <RantingRavager> Rodian females have a demi ****
[0:45:03] <%mitchteck> Side with the women good payoff
[0:45:05] <DatAsuna> jabba had a female rodian but the suit for her was way lower wuality than the other aliens
[0:45:22] <DatAsuna> also that one in the movie had a bad mohawk
[0:45:31] <%SirGO0SE> i LOVE murder
[0:45:34] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[0:45:38] <+Zanco23> I mean to be fair, I can't tell with most animal species if they're male or female.
[0:45:51] <Chisas_Dead_Body> Fill your fanny pack
[0:46:00] <BallerSwagBro9k> Donos Imerekith
[0:46:07] <legacy0117> Male Rodians are ugly TMNT Baxter fly bug eye people. Females are less ugly by far.
[0:46:18] <+MrBaldachin> even trained professionals have to check the genitals of a lot of animals to actually figure it out
[0:46:24] <ggbhtg> To be fair, hmm?
[0:46:26] <PsideFxX> You can see his inventory
[0:46:31] <+Urgoslav> Cheaper goods. I can't tell you what they are or the % saving tho
[0:46:38] <%andrei11dr> The motivation of the true Sith protagonist is literally "I'm just doing it for the lols"
[0:46:40] <BallerSwagBro9k> @mrbaldachin Or maybe that's justxan excuse LUL
[0:46:42] <%SirGO0SE> boskawaaaanda
[0:46:51] <+MrBaldachin> @BallerSwagBro9k 👀
[0:46:53] <grandark_z317> "TWO!?"
[0:46:56] <+Bluemanzee> Technically if you wanna sex an alien aren't you a type of furry? Think about it
[0:47:09] <user_naim> the brother?
[0:47:11] <%lotharrio> You just got him killed.
[0:47:31] <%Djinnazz> HK ALREADY killed someone, lol
[0:47:41] <+MrBaldachin> sometime you gotta cancel combat to get around the game jank
[0:47:43] <+Zanco23> @Bluemanzee Only if they have fur all over their body. So Cathar sex would be a furry thing.
[0:47:44] <+wunp_fxs> amazin
[0:47:45] <+Urgoslav> We are finally almost as powerful as T3 started out as.
[0:47:45] <Finaldragoon> UNLIMITED POWER
[0:47:45] <%SirGO0SE> WE ENDGAME NOW
[0:47:46] <%Comradeiota> Yessssssss
[0:47:46] <%Gruhunchously> @lotharrio To be fair, he was teetering on the edge even before Fann showed up.
[0:47:47] <akman14> UNLIMETED
[0:47:47] <%SilvaChariot0133> "Press X to WIN"
[0:47:48] <RantingRavager> UNLIMITED POWER

[0:47:57] <zocano> It's literally this the entire game
[0:47:58] <Fuji808> Unnnnlliimmiitttedddds POWAAA
[0:47:58] <Redblood801> NOT STRONG ENOUGH!
[0:48:03] <DatAsuna> this is why you don't need to worry about minmaxing your sabers lol
[0:48:11] <%Gruhunchously> UNLiiiiiiiiiMITED POWAHHHHH
[0:48:14] <DatAsuna> it's very unnecessary when you're already so OP
[0:48:14] <+gutlesscoward> skullet boi
[0:48:39] <+MrBaldachin> force channel is definitely the way to go still
[0:48:47] <donstylo> From the Jedi who looks like the father from the Orange County Chopper show.
[0:48:47] <@Moobot> That's a tad too many emotes, @ggbhtg (warning)
[0:48:49] <%mankeyfigh> what did I miss?
[0:48:56] <Shady_Squid> I love that in unison, the guys, myself, and half of chat said "UNLIMITED POWER!"
[0:49:12] <legacy0117> Xenophilia is literally a branch of Furry, except the difference is that one can properly identify sapient beings and the other may not be able to. Easy.
[0:49:14] <%lotharrio> @mankeyfigh Force Storm shenanigans and a few HK fights.
[0:49:15] <%fallenangelzelos> @mankeyfigh some HK fights and leveling up GoTo
[0:49:15] <ggbhtg> yovgLUL yovgDorf doodSprinkle doodScrub
[0:49:17] <$SilverRoddo> Remember, don’t speak moistly.
[0:49:28] <%mankeyfigh> No Handmaiden fight?
[0:49:41] <%lotharrio> Not yet, they're slowly working towards the ship for that.
[0:49:48] <%Gruhunchously> Two crates instead of twenty four
[0:49:48] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:49:58] <agrippaarpeggio> under?
[0:50:22] <legacy0117> Egyptian mythology is a good example of these differences.
[0:50:28] <Zouledge> Not 12 , didn’t he say 2 dozen which is 24 crates ?
[0:50:29] <nepwar> I dont think it will give you ds points if you choose that
[0:50:30] <ggbhtg> neither siding
[0:50:30] <Tucker0603> I love how you use force lightning in SWTOR as a sith assassin. you literally shoot it into your lightsaber to supercharge it
[0:50:33] <+MidnightBurst12> haggling over someone's life?
[0:50:34] <Deadbulky> Chaotic Neutral
[0:50:39] <Tucker0603> he's a grey jedi
[0:50:40] <DatAsuna> qui-gon's considered gray
[0:50:41] <%lotharrio> "Can you even BELIEVE that guy offered me all this money to scare you away? I don't really wanna but it's SO MUCH money."
[0:50:43] <%siamzero94> qui gon is a bitch though
[0:50:49] <%SirGO0SE> he a binch
[0:50:55] <nepwar> haggling is not a against the code
[0:50:58] <user_naim> He wasn’t getting points though
[0:51:07] <+Zanco23> Qui-Gon was played by Liam Neeson. He has a dark side.
[0:51:09] <+evbites> he discovered force ghosts
[0:51:15] <Zouledge> Quigon is usually considered a grey Jedi though
[0:51:15] <DatAsuna> Qui-gon takes his lightsaber and goes out on the town hoping black men will start fights with him
[0:51:16] <Redblood801> For a Duros, the species that discovered Hyper Space Travel, Oondar is an idiot.
[0:51:22] <%andrei11dr> Qui Gom is follower of the hustler way
[0:51:23] <Malik1002> where John at
[0:51:32] <Malik1002> ?
[0:51:32] <%Gruhunchously> @Zanco23 He wanted to beat the dark side with a cosh.
[0:51:34] <+Bluemanzee> John is asleep rn
[0:51:44] <%lotharrio> Qui-Gon has a certain set of Jedi skills.
[0:51:50] <+Urgoslav> Qui Gon fucks
[0:51:52] <agrippaarpeggio> welp, you're still getting a discount by force no matter what here LUL
[0:51:55] <%fallenangelzelos> YOU HAD ONE JOB, JEDI!!
[0:52:04] <ggbhtg> ROLLBACKS no jutsu
[0:52:04] <AllTheZibas> Fann doesnt job Pog
[0:52:13] <Toastyrific> not job
[0:52:18] <Malik1002> wow darkside just got away with haggling and john ain't here to make them remember
[0:52:21] <+MrBaldachin> protect the cute rodian gf
[0:52:24] <GarbageNirvana> He never did say he'd kill her
[0:52:33] <%Gruhunchously> This camera angle is intense
[0:52:36] <heartlesshealer> he's just a fuck
[0:52:39] <nepwar> PROMISE NOTHING DELIVERY LESS
[0:52:45] <%Gruhunchously> MANY REASONS
[0:52:46] <ggbhtg> Hunch-step, that might come up next podcast LUL
[0:52:53] <user_naim> what a fucking chad our character is
[0:52:58] <PsideFxX> You could have seen his inventory earlier before you accepted the quest
[0:53:08] <zocano> "a little"
[0:53:18] <%SirGO0SE> cute rodian saleswoman gf
[0:53:20] <legacy0117> Anyways back to negotiating with ugly as sin Rodians.
[0:53:25] <%lotharrio> I think you may have messed it up, V.
[0:53:42] <+kekkerscrew> You're pretty smart for one of those people
[0:53:45] <Goodvibes99508> talking to her activates it
[0:53:50] <ingman112> Go offer to take the other guy’s deal and it should proc
[0:53:50] <Deadbulky> Messed it up by not doing option one of match her discount
[0:53:55] <+Bluemanzee> She's not cute she's just Greedo with a feminine voice
[0:53:58] <%Djinnazz> "Young man, you speak so well!"
[0:53:58] <Deadbulky> Yeah
[0:54:01] <nepwar> you need to piss of ooderon more so he says no merchant will deal with you
[0:54:21] <%fallenangelzelos> Save first
[0:54:32] <legacy0117> The voice helps the female variation be a lot less ugly overall.
[0:54:32] <%Gruhunchously> Funny you mention that...
[0:54:34] <+kekkerscrew> Exchange LOL
[0:54:50] <dereks0n> NOT THE NAVY
[0:54:52] <%lotharrio> "There are no cops in this town anymore."
[0:54:53] <+Bluemanzee> I'd argue nothing helps you be hotter if you look like a literal frog

[0:55:10] <Shady_Squid> The younglings!
[0:55:10] <nepwar> i killed 911 and they gave me a roomba
[0:55:21] <ChloeFleurage> I love how cartoonishly evil you can get in kotor 2
[0:55:23] <legacy0117> A frog. You mean a bug mutant.
[0:55:32] <ChloeFleurage> like force persuading muggers into giving you all their stolen cash and jumping in a pit
[0:55:34] <%andrei11dr> Even the firefighters?
[0:55:44] <+Razputin217> I AM THE LAW
[0:55:46] <+BigDumBeak> He calls 911 and Phan picks up his phone slowely from his pocket, ringing.
[0:55:54] <+Bluemanzee> I guess I do now that I think about it
[0:55:54] <+Brandon__Brando> so a world where your a fbi agent

[1:00:05] <nepwar> a lightsaber: best i can give is 50. a small gand stabby stabby: I'LL TAKE YOUR ENTIRE STOCK
[1:00:05] <%Gruhunchously> King Arthurs armor in a world where the Knights of the Round Table are still a major political force.
[1:00:22] <legacy0117> Twerka industries? Oh this game is so old . x3
[1:00:28] <gruulmagebeast> did they finish the cutscene extravaganza
[1:00:33] <+Bluemanzee> Even nowadays his armor would be inflated in price due to the association
[1:00:38] <%lotharrio> "Heavy" Slap that onto Handmaiden!
[1:01:00] <alrobot2014> little gand sticks worth more than LIGHTSABERS
[1:01:09] <ScreamLord> poorly
[1:01:11] <+Bluemanzee> It works by not working
[1:01:22] <DatAsuna> it doesn't, every story decides the value of credits as and when the authro wants
[1:01:30] <tjplat> star wars economy is this, credits are credits and if we focused on inflation with millions of planets we would go insane
[1:01:36] <%GraceTBM> other people can use gand silencers, most people can't use lightsabers, i guess that's why they sell for less
[1:01:40] <DatAsuna> and that's fine
[1:01:40] <Redblood801> The economy in Star Wars is great due to all the GALACTIC WARS that keep happening.
[1:01:43] <ralphfromdk> Bottom 2 are better
[1:01:46] <%lotharrio> OH the bar still has a drop you can pick up.
[1:02:00] <giga_bit> here comes the MONEY
[1:02:01] <%andrei11dr> Just sell the swords you'll never use them since you got the light sabers early
[1:02:02] <legacy0117> Gand sticks inflict a load of stun damage, very effective knocking out bounties and earning big MONEH.
[1:02:02] <%Gruhunchously> @GraceTBM That, or the Gand have an EXCELLENT marketing department.

[1:05:07] <%Gruhunchously> Can we take all these credits and spend them on a therapy regimen for our entire party?
[1:05:21] <Merkensteiner> INVEST IN YOURSELF
[1:05:21] <+Zanco23> I mean if we can hold entire full-body armor in our pocket. I don't see why we can't hold on that money in as well.
[1:05:24] <Zouledge> Oddly I think economic of spice is easier to understand than credits
[1:05:29] <%Gigmunch> No man that isn’t my massive dong it’s just my credit pouch
[1:05:31] <deviljhojho_> @Bluemanzee I mean if you put it that way it does sound more efficient

[1:09:28] <heartlesshealer> it's the best
[1:09:30] <+MrBaldachin> if only this was a modern game and there were some detailed bouncing animations to go with its dialogue
[1:09:38] <%fallenangelzelos> Bao-dur getting a dialogue workout

[1:11:12] <+MrBaldachin> hanharr sux
[1:11:14] <dorpork> im the original game these scenes are spread out over the game. the restored content mod makes them trigger all at once
[1:11:20] <ralphfromdk> Man, it's been so long since i've played it, i can't for the life of me remember who it is
[1:11:20] <deviljhojho_> hanharr 2: with a vengeance
[1:11:24] <megamirk> the last party member is better than most, aside from maybe Kreia
[1:11:33] <+captain_history> he is yeah

[1:11:51] <%Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus You haven't finished talking to HK about the HK-50s. There are still questions you haven't asked him.
[1:11:52] <zocano> I prefer Dantooine first but Nar Shadaa is absolutely the better "first" planet
[1:11:54] <%andrei11dr> Last party member is probably my favorite
[1:11:56] <%GraceTBM> woolie can't get d, right? who is the remaining companion?
[1:12:00] <gruulmagebeast> in the original version you dont even get hk till the end of nar shadaa
[1:12:07] <+LegacyOfTheSith> <messge deleted> Kappa

[1:12:42] <+Bluemanzee> Mira could have been better, but they dropped the ball on her

[1:12:47] <+Zanco23> Dante T3 and Vergil HK
[1:12:47] <%ChoculaUltra> T3's brilliant incandescence burns my eyes FeelsBadMan
[1:12:48] <DatAsuna> he's standing proud

[1:13:36] <ralphfromdk> Like all of Star Wars, the astro droid is the real hero in the end...
[1:13:42] <donstylo> The only thing that is more blue than T3 are Woolies balls because he can't talk with Gothgirl.
[1:13:46] <%ChoculaUltra> Read somewhere that JoJo fans were the vegans of the anime community and well, it's not wrong.

[1:17:18] <AllTheZibas> Hoes mad? Hoes mad!
[1:18:16] <%GraceTBM> do silver
[1:18:16] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[1:18:28] <zocano> silver is ight
[1:18:32] <+Bluemanzee> whitesaber
[1:18:33] <DatAsuna> silver is fine but i ain't into it
[1:18:39] <Tucker0603> orange best color
[1:18:41] <donstylo> Black Lightsaber best Lightsaber.
[1:18:44] <giga_bit> the "OC do not steal" saber, still cool though
[1:18:44] <megamirk> it's no purple
[1:18:45] <ThePimpGuin> silver is fine, cyan and veridian are the best new colors tho
[1:18:46] <%Comradeiota> Better than the darksaber from Force Awakens
[1:18:47] <%Prevot> it's SO WHITE
[1:18:47] <DatAsuna> yee orange club
[1:18:53] <SinnerBeta> green, silver and gold are the best colors
[1:18:53] <%lotharrio> Silver is classic. It looks like the sabers Vader and Obi Wan fought with in New Hope.
[1:18:54] <%GraceTBM> orange is best color
[1:18:58] <zocano> I'm dumb and prefer the solid blue
[1:19:01] <+Bluemanzee> Blue and green sabers still fuck idc what anyone says
[1:19:01] <Zouledge> I enjoy it but red is best imo
[1:19:02] <%ChoculaUltra> dude those black aura'd lightsabers from SWTOR are too damn cool. My teenage self pats me on the back each time it goes vrrrrrm
[1:19:04] <zocano> purple is a close second
[1:19:04] <LeafarOznolam> the dark saber though leyGimmie
[1:19:07] <megamirk> purple for +2 to WIPEOUTS
[1:19:12] <%Puhff> Best color was black from Force UNleashed
[1:19:21] <%GraceTBM> force unleashed sucks, but it's black lightsaber was dope
[1:19:29] <giga_bit> viridian is the most underrated color
[1:19:41] <%GraceTBM> isn't viridian just light green
[1:19:46] <LeafarOznolam> mando jedi
[1:19:48] <giga_bit> yeah but it looks nice tho
[1:19:51] <%Gruhunchously> Yeah...but it's cool damnit
[1:19:53] <%GraceTBM> fair
[1:20:03] <gruulmagebeast> can you have other characters make stuff for you?
[1:20:14] <zocano> yes
[1:20:15] <%GraceTBM> between green and viridian i'll always choose the latter
[1:20:22] <ThePimpGuin> redone veridian is a more dark green and looks best
[1:20:26] <%emeraldskrull> woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO
[1:20:31] <%GraceTBM> party members can make things in the world, just not on the ship
[1:20:34] <zocano> in fact it's usually better to do so since they might have certain stats higher
[1:20:35] <megamirk> Katarn has a blue lightsaber = blue is best
[1:20:39] <+Proxzo> Who ships Exar-Kun and I-Chan?
[1:20:50] <%GraceTBM> blue is the vanilla ice cream of lightsaber colros
[1:20:59] <megamirk> aka the best
[1:21:04] <ThePimpGuin> ohoho
[1:21:15] <%Gruhunchously> Which planet he could be talking about?
[1:21:25] <ThePimpGuin> i think duxon/ onderon
[1:21:26] <+vaporousTippler> Katarn only had a blue saber in Jedi Outcast. Because Lucasarts demanded they change it to blue.
[1:21:35] <%GraceTBM> from the ship, it should just grab the highest value from all your party members and use it
[1:21:38] <gruulmagebeast> COVID-19 aka the RAKGHOUL DISEASE
[1:21:39] <Goodvibes99508> cyan tho?
[1:21:44] <megamirk> yeah, in Dark Forces 2 he has a green one?
[1:21:47] <%GraceTBM> she would say NO
[1:21:52] <DatAsuna> not too hard, just no time
[1:21:54] <+Zanco23> @vaporousTippler Blue's a great color.
[1:21:56] <+vaporousTippler> Green and yellow, at different points.
[1:22:00] <%GraceTBM> "this is where i sit on the ship:
[1:22:00] <zocano> She absolutely would tell you no
[1:22:08] <zocano> She in fact has dialogue entirely about it
[1:22:24] <%Gruhunchously> Craft it yourself. What are you? Too *weak8?
[1:22:32] <+Bluemanzee> Might as well just use a sword Kappa
[1:22:34] <gruulmagebeast> are black sabers in this game?
[1:22:36] <%GraceTBM> god, K's skill request went undone for so long for me cause i never remembered to touch up my bad stats
[1:22:42] <%GraceTBM> no black sabers in this
[1:22:44] <Redblood801> Nope @gruulmagebeast
[1:22:46] <%GraceTBM> maybe in a mod
[1:22:46] <DatAsuna> Speaking of dev issues, darth scion was meant to have little shards of himelf floating around him but they couldn't get the particle system to work
[1:22:48] <LeafarOznolam> sad
[1:22:50] <SinnerBeta> love it, it's beautiful, goes well with bright jedi robes or black sith robes

[1:35:19] <Safarihat> ASK HER ABOUT THE FORCE
[1:35:20] <CaptainBright> Ask her about the force
[1:35:22] <zocano> weird huh
[1:35:26] <YakumoYomi> @Gruhunchously Agreed. Being a "gender-locked" companion means that most players are probably not going to get him as an ally
[1:35:28] <zocano> so many Jedi
[1:35:28] <SinnerBeta> a cargohold of Jedis
[1:35:29] <Iwashi94> Jedi stonks
[1:35:30] <+Quarkee> the space Winnebago
[1:35:32] <%GraceTBM> ask about her force
[1:35:32] <ralphfromdk> Jedi clown car
[1:35:34] <+Bluemanzee> They started breeding when Atton wasn't looking
[1:35:34] <giga_bit> Too Many Jedi
[1:35:36] <%emeraldskrull> woolieDATTEBAYO

[1:35:56] <Jaku2011> No
[1:35:56] <DatAsuna> Nope
[1:35:57] <TDAWS_MP132> not quite
[1:35:59] <zocano> No
[1:36:01] <LeafarOznolam> ask gramma about the force
[1:36:02] <DatAsuna> V was just minmaxing you
[1:36:04] <%lotharrio> Nope
[1:36:11] <%Gruhunchously> That's not true, he's lying
[1:36:13] <DatAsuna> it just slows you down
[1:36:22] <ggbhtg> Atris is making a flame war slam video right now
[1:36:22] <zocano> I talked with both equally in my first playthrough and never had an issue
[1:36:23] <%jiggy_snipe> slows the process
[1:36:24] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Almost like the Exile is single-handedly responsible for rebuilding the order after its collapse
[1:36:25] <+MrBaldachin> I don't ever remember having to do this
[1:36:26] <giga_bit> That's true, but also false
[1:36:26] <+kekkerscrew> V wanted to speedrun it
[1:36:30] <%GraceTBM> you were just on the threshold, really close
[1:36:39] <Ravenian96> It's literally just if Visas influence up Handmaiden no like unless Handmaiden max
[1:36:46] <ggbhtg> But is it DRASTIC GO DOWN?
[1:36:46] <+wunp_fxs> fuckin ofc they did
[1:36:47] <Tucker0603> HAREM ROUTE
[1:36:56] <%prime_name> They kinda did that in Pillars 2
[1:36:57] <+kekkerscrew> It's not hard to do, V just wanted to max stuff out as quick as possible
[1:36:59] <SinnerBeta> sith hussies!
[1:36:59] <Redblood801> I want the Harem
[1:36:59] <%Jetzord> Handmaiden learned from Atris
[1:37:00] <Deadbulky> If you have handmaiden go darkside they become besties
[1:37:01] <LeeOhX> HUSSY
[1:37:01] <zocano> but my team was Handmaiden and Kreia nearly the entire game so Handmaiden influence was never a problem for me

[1:53:59] <%siamzero94> well they see with the force
[1:54:00] <%Gruhunchously> They only see through the force
[1:54:00] <RantingRavager> HOT
[1:54:00] <Ravenian96> Literally flesh comes up eye sockets
[1:54:01] <+Kriptin> Metallica's One but Star Wars
[1:54:05] <nepwar> they hear and then they see
[1:54:07] <ggbhtg> ALSO, you live alone
[1:54:16] <+wunp_fxs> probably
[1:54:17] <%jiggy_snipe> i imagine it's like the Maiden In Black
[1:54:18] <+Testfall_V> Sockets yes, eyes no iirc
[1:54:19] <BallerSwagBro9k> Pat Ultimate Nightmare
[1:54:21] <Matermind0> That happens to me sometimes when I wake up
[1:54:23] <Redblood801> They have sockets
[1:54:23] <zanzibarian_hamster> There is concept art of it, it's...morrowindesque, if you get me.
[1:54:25] <Matermind0> It’s horrible
[1:54:25] <Daxalog> 2 extra ho- Oh...nevermind
[1:54:26] <+ZoltanBMagnus> They do have sockets
[1:54:28] <+evbites> so like a flesh dome with a nose and mouth
[1:54:34] <DatAsuna> there are sockets
[1:54:41] <megamirk> who cares, keep it covered and get in bed
[1:54:41] <%lotharrio> Sockets, but flesh covering them normally. But Visas' flesh was cut away so she has big gaping blackness there.
[1:54:43] <privatesargent> just looked it up, they DO have eye sockets
[1:54:44] <%fallenangelzelos> They work for Yorha
[1:54:47] <DatAsuna> i'll dm you pictures
[1:54:53] <StarlitStunner> Just flat skin, sockets intact underneath. They cover up with headdress and glasses.
[1:55:04] <donstylo> Miraluka are like Pirates without the fakes eyes.
[1:55:05] <+Zanco23> Read the legends comic "unseen, unheard" to see Visas eye holes.
[1:55:05] <Katanas69> theres flesh but Hungry Boi cut them into sockets to torture her
[1:55:09] <NaturalGear> not sure if it's creepier with or without sockets
[1:55:14] <%Gruhunchously> Not like Oxygen, but like...I dunno, dopamine
[1:55:27] <SinnerBeta> oxygen destroyer bomb
[1:55:28] <muniea3> that's just the UK

[2:02:44] <zocano> you get ...some sort of feel for what it is
[2:02:45] <alephalpha> I'd Imagine evrything just falls dead
[2:02:50] <zocano> or how it looks rather
[2:02:51] <Dangerzone979> Is it the same thing Vitiate does in SWTOR?
[2:02:51] <ggbhtg> wut it do chief
[2:02:57] <%lotharrio> There's a Force power that does that... you gotta assume he's doing it at a massive level.
[2:03:00] <DatAsuna> nah it's different from vitiate
[2:03:01] <Nested_Dreams> Or midichlorians deletion
[2:03:02] <ralphfromdk> You know the bullshit the Emporer does in Rise of Skywalker? Kinda like that but for a whole planet
[2:03:05] <ggbhtg> but WUT IT DO CHIEF
[2:03:08] <zocano> It's drain life on a mass level
[2:03:09] <zocano> ya
[2:03:10] <riggs_the_roadie> Is this dude fucking Galactus?
[2:03:11] <DatAsuna> Wait till endgame
[2:03:16] <%GraceTBM> Drain life+force
[2:03:17] <RedSqurrl> I always imagine what like Valkorian does in SWTOR
[2:03:25] <+Greezey> sometimes they dont tell you the actual function until the end, so they can keep the mystery of it going
[2:03:27] <ThePimpGuin> Like Palpatine in the rise of Skywalker
[2:03:31] <donstylo> He summons Giant Force Mosquitos that suck the force out of people.
[2:03:33] <ggbhtg> Auswhalen from BLEACH?
[2:03:33] <RedSqurrl> EVerything just goes grey and people dissolve into dirt
[2:03:40] <%lotharrio> Just all life on the planet falls over, dead
[2:03:44] <+Kyma1020> @woolieversus Blood Bending episode of Avatar, Hama pulls water from plants and there’s just a big circle of dead plants. So Hungry boy is that but on a bigger scale.

[2:05:36] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Kirby couldn't ignore that shit
[2:05:41] <Reizie_Etherealm> Don't forget the sides, the grilled veggies
[2:05:41] <+EleazarTheSkeleton> Keep the Force Turkey away from Alucard tho
[2:05:42] <megamirk> sniff
[2:05:45] <zocano> Darth Kirby
[2:05:45] <ggbhtg> WAFT
[2:05:45] <CaptainBright> now the question is: who opened that window
[2:05:46] <%lotharrio> Bacon wrapped, deep fried turkey
[2:05:47] <zocano> shows up
[2:05:48] <%GeneralSCPatton> They were looking at it too hard, and it came to eat them. Sounds like Hellstar Remina.
[2:05:55] <%Space_Pagan> Jedi are morons
[2:05:57] <donstylo> It's like making Lasange knowing Garfield is in the room.
[2:06:07] <%lotharrio> Like a cartoon character smelling a fresh pie and just floating right over there.

[2:06:41] <+Bluemanzee> Sounds like a good idea if you didn't know that you'd summon Force Chthulu
[2:06:41] <zocano> There's nothing to feel
[2:06:46] <ShakiraAkira> !uptime
[2:06:46] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 6 minutes
[2:06:52] <%jiggy_snipe> if they could feel him, then they could find him
[2:06:53] <%Gruhunchously> No, because they feel through the force, and he basically exists outside the force. He's a force vampire.
[2:06:54] <%siamzero94> Feeling what, the force can't escape him
[2:06:58] <privatesargent> he is a wound in the force, there is nothing for them to feel
[2:07:10] <Memdosu> He is a blackhole
[2:07:18] <%lotharrio> Maybe it's like the Tyrannids. You can't sense him coming, but from an outside point of view, you see a shadow moving through your magic senses.
[2:07:20] <availablethor> Yeah, force black hole
[2:07:23] <megamirk> "something is hunting us, we better ALL gather on this planet"

[2:09:01] <%Gruhunchously> But also, this is something the Jedi have never faced before. Ever
[2:09:06] <%gatorafan> click on "show all images" daedra1DrunkTibs
[2:09:15] <+Bluemanzee> Imagine Dragon Ball Super in OG Dragon Ball
[2:09:18] <Ravenian96> And will never face again, because we all forgot how to do it lmao
[2:09:39] <%Gruhunchously> That's a good way of putting it
[2:09:39] <Fujiwara_92> he's the concept of hunger basically at this point
[2:09:41] <ggbhtg> you're going to the BLAGHO
[2:09:42] <alephalpha> imagine shooting lightning at him and he just takes it in
[2:09:45] <%Yung_Booker> Anti-saiyan tech, you mean frieza
[2:09:46] <megamirk> they didn't anticipate Nihillus could access sadpanda too, in fact he was a mod
[2:09:47] <atema128> Nihilus’ mask was originally meant to be carved from Revan’s skull.
[2:09:51] <%Djinnazz> He’s Star Wars Galactus

[2:10:29] <DSD24> Like on this ship?
[2:10:36] <%gatorafan> you know what place has a lot of Jedi right now????
[2:10:40] <%lotharrio> It's a long term recycle project
[2:10:46] <%Space_Pagan> GLAZE THE EBON HAWK
[2:10:47] <ggbhtg> a natural phenomenon?
[2:10:50] <alephalpha> yeah it's supposed to stop abraxus
[2:10:53] <ThePimpGuin> @atema128 well thats insurmountable
[2:10:53] <+Greezey> like da reapers
[2:10:53] <dereks0n> That's some Mass Effect shit
[2:10:58] <Augus7717> Cant ignore a gatherng of Jedi you say? As we make everyone a jedi on our ship.
[2:11:05] <a_mad_dragon> galactus survived the big crunch of the previous universe
[2:11:08] <alephalpha> the repaer are kinda dumber though
[2:11:09] <%siamzero94> exactly, though on your first playthrough it's not supposed to be that fast
[2:11:12] <%lotharrio> When the universe dies, Galactus dies and resets everything.
[2:11:13] <ALTRNico> ALMOST all life
[2:11:13] <%JohnAtDawn> Well I mean that's your fault woolie
[2:11:14] <donstylo> Ok next LP Mass Effect 2.
[2:11:20] <%jiggy_snipe> i think the reapers were different
[2:11:21] <+Bluemanzee> The problem with that is new life happens a lot inside a universe I'd imagine
[2:11:22] <ralphfromdk> Next playthrough confirmed??????? :O
[2:11:26] <%Gruhunchously> You guys need to play Mass Effect 2 after this
[2:11:27] <dorpork> Galactus predates Mass Effect by decades, so that would make ME some Galactus shit
[2:11:31] <akman14> ME2 confirmed?
[2:11:34] <%Space_Pagan> The Ebon Hawk is looking very tasty right now
[2:11:38] <alephalpha> so what you're saying is DARTH VORE is keeping them you don't know what you've done
[2:11:41] <BallerSwagBro9k> LP 2 AND 3
[2:11:43] <derap41> Basically they let life grow takes all that new inovation then kill all life before it can overpower them
[2:11:46] <ALTRNico> BIG BRAIN
[2:11:46] <Deadbulky> Hey man i heard u keep getting killed by ais so we made some ais to kill you so the ais dont kill you

[2:26:26] <%lotharrio> Yeah I heard that too, @Bluemanzee
[2:26:32] <%fallenangelzelos> Kreia: I mean...let's just keep the idea open.
[2:26:37] <subjectg> trask, unsung hero of the republic
[2:26:42] <SinnerBeta> kreia is taking up more and more of the screen
[2:27:02] <Ravenian96> Kinda reaching
[2:27:05] <ALTRNico> her name is now Visa
[2:27:09] <carlosmiyamoto> I miss Bed Intruder Trask
[2:27:09] <ThePimpGuin> ultimate GILF
[2:27:10] <%Gruhunchously> Kreia is Handmaiden and Visas' child from the future
[2:27:14] <%lotharrio> Granny, "Don't touch that Echani or Miraluka! Race mixing isn't allowed on this ship!"
[2:27:30] <SinnerBeta> she doesn't need her eyes, she has eyes... on the inside
[2:27:37] <$QueequegTheater> TWINCEST YE
[2:27:41] <%andrei11dr> Well she lost het sight because Sion beat the shit out her
[2:27:46] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> but how can two females have a child Kappa
[2:27:58] <%Alazull> Remember that the Dark Side tends to ravage your body in exchange for power...
[2:27:59] <RantingRavager> I mean, 3 is fine. If they CHOOSE to die for you, it's totally fine
[2:28:13] <%JimJamsJimJamboree> I have you and Pat's streams going at once and feel like I'm having a stroke
[2:28:25] <megamirk> she's just pragmatic
[2:28:31] <+Fortunato5678> She can be straight up wrong, though
[2:28:44] <ALTRNico> technically NOT wrong
[2:28:46] <+yunngin> hopefully this stays stable for you guys. This game completely and totally fell apart for me at the end
[2:28:47] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[2:28:58] <SinnerBeta> "The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.” ~ Darth Vader
[2:29:08] <%Djinnazz> More like she’ll say things she WANTS to happen
[2:29:13] <%JohnAtDawn> Palpatine shit
[2:29:14] <alephalpha> two egge fertilization is a thing for in vitro clinincs
[2:29:17] <DSD24> Nihlus with that NEW TECH
[2:29:32] <Ravenian96> TRUE
[2:29:41] <%lotharrio> I do like that Revan and Malak seemed attainable. But the Sith Lords in this one are all trash baby unique powers all over the place.
[2:29:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> No you learn by CROSSSING YOUR EYES
[2:29:52] <privatesargent> magic 3d eye puzzles = the power to consume life.... seems legite
[2:29:59] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @SuperSpaceWatt
[2:30:17] <%lotharrio> No one man should have all that power!
[2:30:20] <+SuperSpaceWatt> It's like learning Ultima in Final Fantasy Tactics
[2:30:29] <zocano> as Pat said during the KOTOR LP, the sith in 2 are basically darkness and evil incarnate
[2:30:33] <%Space_Pagan> badass

[2:30:44] <%jiggy_snipe> neat
[2:30:45] <alephalpha> just HUNGER
[2:30:47] <subjectg> nothing more than a beast
[2:30:47] <jaygee303> Is this emperor vitiate?
[2:30:49] <Memdosu> A zombie
[2:30:50] <%siamzero94> He is not in control of himself anymore
[2:30:52] <Deadbulky> Litteral blackhole
[2:30:53] <zocano> He *IS* hunger
[2:30:53] <alephalpha> he's a fucking taxxon
[2:30:54] <GarbageNirvana> Force zombie
[2:30:55] <ralphfromdk> He is a Force Zombie
[2:30:55] <%andrei11dr> wooliePOYO wooliePOYO wooliePOYO
[2:30:56] <alrobot2014> he's kinda a natural disaster
[2:30:57] <%kyh9> Just a void in robes
[2:30:58] <%lotharrio> Sith Lich, let's go!
[2:30:59] <DSD24> But you, you will be worse

[2:31:14] <alephalpha> basically a TAXXON
[2:31:24] <Skullyton175> SirUwU SirUwU SirUwU
[2:31:30] <%lotharrio> @alephalpha I get that reference, now.
[2:31:33] <atema128> Nihilus is effectively a black hole in the shape of a man.
[2:31:33] <alephalpha> a light saber has an edge at every angle
[2:31:36] <halfmasks> Sion is a Physical Zombie, Nihilus is the Spiritual Zombie
[2:31:52] <megamirk> midichlorians are flammable?
[2:32:04] <LeeOhX> Dont you dare brings those back up
[2:32:05] <%Space_Pagan> Force is a Plot Device
[2:32:17] <alephalpha> @lotharrio ayyyy yeah the books were way to good for a middleschool series
[2:32:20] <megamirk> @LeeOhX I mean it's CANON Kappa
[2:32:24] <%lotharrio> Can't have more than one of those things running around.
[2:32:24] <%Gruhunchously> Pretty compelling point
[2:32:29] <Ravenian96> Super mega death zombie SIth
[2:32:30] <%kyh9> They're a plague
[2:32:30] <%jiggy_snipe> the force is whatver you want it to be baby
[2:32:31] <Deadbulky> Multiple blackholes
[2:32:34] <%kyh9> like Locusts
[2:32:43] <SinnerBeta> it's a fire, mindless and all consuming
[2:32:43] <LeeOhX> @megamirk NOOOOOOOOOOOO
[2:33:05] <alephalpha> I wonder what kind of person he was before
[2:33:11] <alephalpha> ohhh he's basically vergil
[2:33:18] <%andrei11dr> Didn't they got Sion's name by now?
[2:33:21] <%Space_Pagan> I need more power!
[2:33:22] <Deadbulky> Vergil after eating the fruit
[2:33:29] <%lotharrio> They do, but they are sticking with the nicknames.
[2:33:31] <alephalpha> DARTH VORE WAS MOTIVATED
[2:33:41] <Fujiwara_92> I NEED VORE POWER!
[2:33:42] <WanderingSwordsman> He's literally a Lich

[2:34:22] <Ravenian96> Too bad that new sequel trilogy got cancelled
[2:34:26] <%Gruhunchously> I need more POWER
[2:34:49] <ALTRNico> soooo it's magic?
[2:34:54] <alephalpha> it's not really interetsing in any plot, thematic or character sense
[2:34:58] <alephalpha> but it was cool
[2:35:08] <alephalpha> yeah it's always been magic
[2:35:09] <%Space_Pagan> Space Magic
[2:35:31] <+Bluemanzee> Star Wars is technically just fantasy with a sci-fi skin

[2:43:42] <zocano> Have you been learning, Woolie
[2:43:43] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> many lies of omission
[2:43:44] <LordGoodrick> She's telling the truth!...From a certain point of view
[2:43:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> She is showing that her hand but all the cards are blank
[2:43:54] <nzrai> she has a side deck
[2:43:55] <mistersups> Texas Holdem
[2:43:57] <alephalpha> well how do you know those cards are not false
[2:43:57] <dereks0n> No she doesn't, she lost that hand
[2:44:00] <Make_me_mad> Poor choice of words.
[2:44:03] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> a lie by omission is still a lie

[2:48:15] <%lotharrio> If it's tied, you get options.
[2:48:16] <dorpork> this is actually a lesson in not reelying too much on the force

[2:50:15] <Ravenian96> But she is mad at Revan repairing droids
[2:50:18] <DSD24> Making Gunpla's is a good skill
[2:50:24] <muniea3> jedis force pushing instead of shitting
[2:50:29] <zanzibarian_hamster> Wait, is that why all your skills actually start at zero, like realistically a random joe would have some repair or persuade skill just living day to day?
[2:50:33] <dereks0n> They remind me of Quarians sorta
[2:50:36] <DatAsuna> humans dominate
[2:50:37] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> I think we can also assume Revan actually took a lotta interest in working on droids

[2:53:20] <SinnerBeta> dark side points for bumming the remote out
[2:53:29] <nepwar> aw shit they didnt do the saber combat
[2:53:30] <Redblood801> G0-T0 time
[2:53:34] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> G0-T0 is so cool
[2:53:39] <nzrai> fat one
[2:53:49] <Memdosu> She sucks
[2:53:50] <DSD24> Wow that white saber
[2:53:52] <subjectg> goto’s a shit, but he’s a good shit
[2:53:53] <zocano> ya Mira is boring
[2:53:54] <+mighty_max_t> G0-T0-SL33P
[2:53:57] <DatAsuna> She's the juhani of kotor 2
[2:54:11] <dorpork> Nah, Mira is a cool character
[2:54:14] <ALTRNico> ONE GUY
[2:54:17] <+Zanco23> I think Mira's cool
[2:54:23] <SinnerBeta> you ate your words about Atton though
[2:54:24] <%lotharrio> He's probably going to be annoyed at what her deal is.
[2:54:27] <Fujiwara_92> Mira is cool tho
[2:54:28] <+wunp_fxs> oooo hot take
[2:54:29] <Goodvibes99508> agreed
[2:54:29] <DatAsuna> oof
[2:54:30] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Mira's story does kinda involve Mando
[2:54:34] <Deadbulky> lsxyzDBB
[2:54:35] <%jiggy_snipe> well he thinks Mira is part of the harem
[2:54:38] <+Slimshazbot> Mira sucks.
[2:54:39] <+MrBaldachin> mira's alright but she's supposed to be strong and competent but she never shows it really
[2:54:39] <%bread_assassin> Woolie is going to be ashamed of his word and deed.
[2:54:41] <%andrei11dr> Mira feels like she belongs in KOTOR 1
[2:54:41] <DSD24> I think its more than that
[2:54:41] <therealslimskippy> mira's fine, not that deep just a bad first impression
[2:54:42] <Zouledge> @DatAsuna Juhani is optional at least, so that makes her better than mira imo
[2:54:44] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Oh I know who he means, yeah that Mando girl is kinda cooler
[2:54:44] <%cisealnine> I love his voice... I mean Goto's voice... and Little V's... and occasionally Woolies.
[2:54:44] <%Alazull> No shit, there's a better version of a character written like a decade prior?
[2:54:50] <Goodvibes99508> 14 months
[2:54:50] <%SirGO0SE> thats okay :)
[2:54:57] <Deadbulky> Darkside Mira Kreygasm
[2:55:00] <usurper_sos> My DICK liked Go To
[2:55:00] <ALTRNico> but your dick tho
[2:55:02] <%mitchteck> Truth
[2:55:04] <DatAsuna> @Zouledge Oh, I actualy like juhani, but she's the one everyone forgets
[2:55:06] <%Space_Pagan> Robosexual?
[2:55:06] <%Prevot> woolie hating on a character for literally no reaso
[2:55:06] <SinnerBeta> now his dick gets hard for G0T0
[2:55:09] <giga_bit> so now his dick ALSO loves goto
[2:55:13] <muniea3> your dick also liked g0t0
[2:55:13] <liljojofett> That's a good singe
[2:55:14] <+ZoltanBMagnus> your dick started to lik eGOTO
[2:55:17] <+Zanco23> Your dick didn't like Goto
[2:55:18] <+MrBaldachin> i'll still take mira over hanharr any day though
[2:55:19] <zocano> I don't agree with V that Goto is more interesting than Atton, but Goto is ight
[2:55:19] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Same thing with Kreia for me, kid me didn't like her when I was like 12, but I love her now
[2:55:25] <dereks0n> To be fair, just try to forget about how she was introduced. Plot used her to advance itself, which ain't her fault
[2:55:29] <zoenzix> wooliePOYO
[2:55:30] <Klefth> Or in your fanny pack, as it were
[2:55:30] <%cisealnine> cisealnine is continuing the Gift Sub they got from TheOneUpWarrior! 
[2:55:34] <%siamzero94> Oof liking GO-TO
[2:55:35] <Fujiwara_92> V's dick likes G0T0
[2:55:36] <Zouledge> @DatAsuna fair enough, i enjoy her also but i usually darkside 99..99 of my playtroughs
[2:55:59] <grandark_z317> @dereks0n that's the fault of the 14 months.
[2:56:01] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> He's like deadpan HK
[2:56:02] <%lotharrio> "I'm way more used to making demands and big tortures."
[2:56:08] <DatAsuna> @Zouledge first gay character in star wars too. lol
[2:56:17] <ALTRNico> he is the ball
[2:56:20] <zocano> the good boy

[2:56:39] <RevaniteRyan> I mean, he has one huge ball right there at least

[2:57:14] <DatAsuna> it's a big galaxy... of 4 planets
[2:57:19] <Zouledge> @DatAsuna i keep forgetting that part, granted even in ds playthrough i get her cuz having an extra party member is always a good thing.
[2:57:30] <megamirk> I will love you if you follow the main quest - G0T0
[2:57:40] <%cisealnine> I must point out that this game came out before YouTube existed.
[2:57:43] <DatAsuna> DAMN RIGHT
[2:57:50] <+wunp_fxs> I LIKE EM

[2:58:04] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> I love how we just have the mafia on board now
[2:58:04] <%lotharrio> G0-T0 is "fuck you, get paid."
[2:58:06] <RevaniteRyan> G0-T0 I have a proposition for great profit. Have you perchance heard if Twekra Industries?
[2:58:06] <usurper_sos> Light side Later
[2:58:06] <+Bluemanzee> He knows what Fann likes
[2:58:08] <%Gruhunchously> Money talks

[2:58:26] <+Bluemanzee> Godbot
[2:58:28] <SinnerBeta> gee zero to zero
[2:58:32] <Fujiwara_92> big G
[2:58:35] <Iwashi94> wait so Goto's not there physically, so... you're waiting for Goto?
[2:58:36] <atema128> G0-T0 is the definition of Light Later.
[2:58:40] <Redblood801> The greater good
[2:58:41] <Deadbulky> Religous doctrine
[2:58:42] <Zouledge> greater good > light side < money for greater good
[2:58:42] <Malik1002> john in the back getting ready
[2:58:43] <subjectg> goto, like the thing that gets you into disastrous loops goto
[2:58:49] <+Bluemanzee> the greater goods > the greater good
[2:58:50] <DSD24> 3 is a such a Woolie answer
[2:58:55] <megamirk> dayum, that's all you needed to say
[2:58:55] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> "Look I know you have those religious or whatever reasons for playing the game, but how about for big crimes and cash?" (echoes of pockets pockets pockets in the distance)
[2:59:07] <RevaniteRyan> “Jedi’s life is sacrifice” is basically white noise at this point
[2:59:07] <ALTRNico> G-UNIT
[2:59:12] <%lotharrio> "How many people do you want murdered, G0-T0?!"

[2:59:50] <atema128> If you say that you’ll do whatever needs to be done, you’d have gotten an influence boost.
[2:59:52] <zocano> this is also why Nar Shadaa seems specifically built to be your first planet
[2:59:58] <%lotharrio> Oh, shit. So you can bring him with you when talking to the Telos guy and handing in that quest, probably for some points.
[2:59:58] <zanzibarian_hamster> Holy shit, g0t0 is voiced by american dad's dad
[2:59:58] <nzrai> i think fann is getting credits at a much faster rate than pockets

[3:01:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> Head cannon: Pockets started a Blood Pool in the Mandilorian wars
[3:01:14] <Nested_Dreams> Big politics and BIG plants

[3:04:23] <nzrai> he streams as a side gig
[3:04:24] <KaiserMario> Now... I'm just guessing, cause I didn't play this, but is Goto just a fake projection, and this G0-T0 the real one?
[3:04:26] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Nah he's in the GAMESPHERE
[3:04:26] <+MrBaldachin> he's prolly got the stonks on multiple monitors and calls with executives going
[3:04:26] <Redblood801> Get in the cube GOTO
[3:04:26] <AllTheZibas> Pat is goto?
[3:04:27] <alephalpha> he's not even playing it caus eit seems semi automated
[3:04:27] <therealslimskippy> he's in the gaming chair
[3:04:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> Goto the PAT of Starwars

[3:04:36] <+SolidusRex> Nobody say anything
[3:04:37] <+PhantomMiG> Goto is pat?
[3:04:39] <+SuperSpaceWatt> But what if he faces the dreaded CONE?
[3:04:41] <alephalpha> PATO
[3:04:42] <Jaku2011> Pat GOTO?
[3:04:45] <%GraceTBM> i always assumed that goto was the robot the whole time

[3:05:13] <Zouledge> do as i say or i implode LUL
[3:05:15] <SinnerBeta> yup, it's that easy to kill the badass, just blow him up in space
[3:05:17] <nzrai> womp womp
[3:05:20] <+theKingRamses> nuke the ship in the same way you nuked peragus
[3:05:23] <DatAsuna> he woulda just threatened to nuke you if you said no
[3:05:26] <Oak_bogle> Nice harbinger call back V
[3:05:33] <DatAsuna> THe nuke threat was always on the table
[3:05:37] <Fujiwara_92> pato = duck in pt-br
[3:05:40] <%Gruhunchously> He would have just nuked you if you had refused.
[3:05:41] <ralphfromdk> No one with 2 braincells wants that thing ever
[3:05:43] <DSD24> Use it
[3:05:50] <+SolidusRex> Too bad there'll be very few droids encountered beyond this point
[3:05:59] <+Slimshazbot> GO-TO is cool and I don't dislike his droid's design... But why the model look so shit tho?
[3:06:00] <%Gruhunchously> STEALTH
[3:06:10] <%andrei11dr> But you het cool dialogue though
[3:06:14] <RevaniteRyan> Stealth ball!
[3:06:16] <SinnerBeta> but he makes your dick hard tho?
[3:06:23] <nzrai> i don't think i've ever leveled him up
[3:06:30] <Zouledge> he's a big floating stealth bomb
[3:06:36] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> He has the final upgrade to destroy droid, dominate droid, technically
[3:06:39] <JetpackMcQuack> Its an hm slave
[3:06:46] <%siamzero94> Is that a low intelligence option from Fallout?
[3:06:48] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> instead of killing droids it makes them just yours
[3:07:52] <%Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus Psst, ask HK more about them
[3:07:53] <%RioGascar> Thanks goto
[3:08:10] <nepwar> LUL
[3:08:23] <+Slimshazbot> Yes because they are SO SUBTLE
[3:08:26] <%lotharrio> "Impeccably timed explosions."
[3:08:29] <%NWannabe> as t3 rolls past
[3:08:43] <nzrai> they couldn't sense the killing intent
[3:08:50] <nepwar> their behavior cores are steaming with hate
[3:08:52] <TheRealSk1ll3s> dang it t3, why do you have to vacuum while i am trying to have a conversation!
[3:09:05] <SinnerBeta> bombardment
[3:09:17] <alephalpha> so they might have killed more people the DARTH VORE
[3:09:19] <%RioGascar> Also they are painted chrome, i dont exactly trust that

[3:12:00] <KidKame1> I've completely given up on the Disney Trilogy
[3:12:03] <RevaniteRyan> Has science gone too far in making a daddy Palpatine?
[3:12:06] <alrobot2014> papatine

[3:12:38] <DatAsuna> The vong are from beyond the regions
[3:12:40] <CaptainBright> gods, fuck the Yuzhan Vong
[3:12:44] <Ravenian96> Woah is that a race of plant pain people!?!?
[3:12:46] <SinnerBeta> @TheOneCalledRock that's what I'm saying, it's a family tradition
[3:12:49] <+Zanco23> The guys hiding in the asteroid, right?
[3:12:50] <Safarihat> vong were from outside the galaxy
[3:12:53] <DatAsuna> the vong are a seperate galaxy
[3:12:53] <+MidnightBurst12> they were from beyond the unknown region
[3:12:57] <endarren> THe Vong came from outside the galaxy
[3:13:00] <%TheOneCalledRock> LUL
[3:13:04] <%siamzero94> well currently playing stellaris on the side and the prethoryns are coming at strength 5x in my game
[3:13:07] <DatAsuna> also canon has been teasing a new not vong outside threat
[3:13:11] <%Gruhunchously> Non Force sensitive, so Force powers don't work on them.
[3:13:15] <+wunp_fxs> LUL
[3:13:17] <%lotharrio> "Keep your knives sharp. We got space dragons out there."
[3:13:17] <privatesargent> the Yuzhan Vong is not even from the Unknown Regions, they are from outside the galaxy and they entered from the Unknown Regions
[3:13:18] <knoth_> !uptime
[3:13:19] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 13 minutes
[3:13:20] <ALTRNico> D:
[3:13:20] <megamirk> they should retcon it and replace Yuzhan with the Empire from LoGH
[3:13:21] <%Space_Pagan> HOLY SHIT
[3:13:23] <nzrai> masaka
[3:13:24] <StarlitStunner> Organic force resistant snake weapons, Yuhzon Vong is stupid
[3:13:24] <%RioGascar> surprise we PULLED AN ARMY OUT OF OUR ASS
[3:13:26] <%NWannabe> woolieGASM
[3:13:27] <KruelDestiny> wtf, for real? D:
[3:13:32] <Jaku2011> Surprise our fictional setting is a galaxy so we can bullshit new enemies all the time
[3:13:38] <Ravenian96> Can't wait to discover Space Nippon
[3:13:39] <+Bluemanzee> They knew about Asia and Africa though
[3:13:42] <%RioGascar> NAH WE FOUND THE EAST INDIES
[3:13:44] <%GeneralSCPatton> ONLY EUROPE EXISTS BECAUSE JESUS LOVES US!
[3:13:45] <ThirdPersonPhil> you dont fall of the edge sillies you hit the great wall
[3:13:48] <RevaniteRyan> I THINK there’s a Yuzhan Vong were referenced in KOTOR 1
[3:13:53] <JetpackMcQuack> D:
[3:13:54] <%RioGascar> whats this new found land shit?
[3:13:54] <%lotharrio> Fucking Star Trek just jumps into the setting from the Unknown Regions.
[3:13:54] <SinnerBeta> I don't think they burned people for believing in round earth
[3:13:59] <Dangerzone979> Vong were extragalacticinvaders/refugees who decided to wage total war on the galaxy to satisfy their BDSM gods
[3:14:01] <%andrei11dr> They did knew about Asia though
[3:14:10] <+Proxzo> No one expects the Spanish Flat Earthers
[3:14:11] <RevaniteRyan> Wow, my phone butchered that sentence
[3:14:11] <DatAsuna> yeah there's a vong scout sip in one of canderous' kotor 1 stories
[3:14:14] <+Captain_Spicy_> Man T3 loves eavesdropping
[3:14:21] <DatAsuna> also the vong are the most 90s ever
[3:14:21] <Zouledge> darth t3 eavesdropping
[3:14:30] <+Zanco23> @RioGascar Yeah when Canderous talks about the asteroid with the ship
[3:14:35] <LeeOhX> My favourite thing about the unkown army that shows up to rock everyones shit, is that there's always the ONE person that actually knew about it all along
[3:14:37] <+SolidusRex> Lehon
[3:14:41] <DatAsuna> Rakata Prime
[3:14:42] <+SolidusRex> Also Rakata Prime
[3:14:42] <megamirk> Carth Onasi's resting place
[3:14:43] <Redblood801> Maybe I'M in charge
[3:14:51] <%Gruhunchously> It doesn't get a name in KOTOR. EU calls it Lehon
[3:14:58] <Dangerzone979> It was hidden like Kamino
[3:14:58] <+MrRabbles> Sith: I'm in charge :)
[3:14:59] <ralphfromdk> Yeah, there are multiple sides to the sith.... Vibroblade boy and hungry boy
[3:15:05] <%lotharrio> You could, in theory, find it just by flying around with enough people, long enough.
[3:15:07] <DatAsuna> Leon and Prime are both used
[3:15:16] <%RioGascar> So am i wrong for thinking “unknown army from edge of galaxy” is one of the laziest ass pulls in sci fi stories?
[3:15:17] <%Gruhunchously> TLJ Luke planet
[3:15:17] <DatAsuna> Kamino is also outside the galaxy btw
[3:15:30] <DatAsuna> The rishi maze is a satellite galaxy
[3:15:35] <%RioGascar> Just OH NO MASSIVE ARMY TIME FOR CONFLICTTTT
[3:15:35] <megamirk> who cares about anything from the new trilogy, lol
[3:15:37] <alephalpha> so when are we gonna talk about the silentium?
[3:15:41] <%breakdancinghobo> space is REALLY big
[3:15:47] <zocano> yo, space is big
[3:15:47] <%lotharrio> @RioGascar As long as they are different enough, it's fine. But it is really overused.
[3:15:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> Lets Talk about how Hyperspace is now instantaneous travel
[3:15:57] <+MidnightBurst12> hyperspace lanes can shift over time
[3:16:00] <akman14> No extranet
[3:16:03] <%Gruhunchously> Space is really big
[3:16:04] <ThirdPersonPhil> the internet ruin stories
[3:16:04] <DatAsuna> The holonet is inconistent
[3:16:04] <%TheOneCalledRock> star wars lore wise is all fucked up huh?
[3:16:05] <ALTRNico> no backup servers
[3:16:11] <%TheOneCalledRock> like really fucked up
[3:16:11] <alephalpha> hwo do you even commjuniactae in across light year distances
[3:16:12] <+TheFabledAble> @WoolieVersus well, maybe you cant have wifi between planets
[3:16:13] <DatAsuna> Star wars space is especially big
[3:16:14] <carlosmiyamoto> Holonet
[3:16:16] <JetpackMcQuack> Space is big
[3:16:19] <%lotharrio> I think they mention like... a "holonet" once or twice.
[3:16:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> @MidnightBurst12 Hyperspace lanes used to be controled by gravity of planets around it.
[3:16:24] <%lotharrio> But it's a nothing.
[3:16:25] <+theKingRamses> believe in the emperor
[3:16:32] <%Takreth> based T3 still making the rounds
[3:16:35] <%Prevot> space internet would be kinda hard to make
[3:16:36] <DatAsuna> Not in canon
[3:16:38] <ralphfromdk> It's hard to send data across space, hence no space internet.
[3:16:39] <DatAsuna> THat's legends only
[3:16:39] <nepwar> star wars feels like naruto where theres tech but at the same time, the main characters look to have no knowledge of it or its uses
[3:16:51] <Tucker0603> well, fuck Disney
[3:16:54] <StarlitStunner> Don’t the hutts run the holonet and not the republic?
[3:17:00] <%fallenangelzelos> i thought that wasn't corosant?
[3:17:01] <gruulmagebeast> what is the center now cause of sewuels?
[3:17:03] <RevaniteRyan> “What is this, ‘computer’ you speak of?!”
[3:17:05] <%TheOneCalledRock> it makes me kinda glad i never got into the series when i was young because I would be losing my mind
[3:17:05] <gruulmagebeast> quels
[3:17:06] <DatAsuna> Republic Commando is a different triple 0
[3:17:09] <%TheOneCalledRock> LUL
[3:17:10] <Tucker0603> oh yeah, that dude is rad
[3:17:12] <DatAsuna> Droid triple 0 is canon
[3:17:14] <%RioGascar> the robot
[3:17:15] <%Gruhunchously> Wasn't that IG-88?
[3:17:22] <%lotharrio> Malak had no plan.
[3:17:40] <megamirk> she also had a jaw
[3:17:40] <Redblood801> Malak was the biggest idiot
[3:17:42] <megamirk> heh
[3:17:47] <alephalpha> G0-T0 is like fuck thses children
[3:17:51] <+MrRabbles> She wanted to fill her pocketsssssss
[3:17:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> Everyone shit talks Malak: The Game
[3:17:55] <Ravenian96> Malak smash
[3:17:55] <dorpork> this game is making fun of the fact that Malak is a saturday morning cartoon villain
[3:17:57] <+Bluemanzee> Malak was just Generic Sith™
[3:18:00] <DatAsuna> Malak's only good shit ever is in the comics
[3:18:02] <+Zanco23> @Gruhunchously I think he means the droid in the Disney Vader comics
[3:18:04] <RevaniteRyan> Malek: “what is that? BLOW IT UP!”
[3:18:07] <DatAsuna> and it's all before he was malak
[3:18:07] <SinnerBeta> Malak: can't I tho?
[3:18:10] <zocano> ha ha planet go boom
[3:18:16] <%Gruhunchously> Brrr Planet Destruction Machine goes Brrr

[3:26:06] <BigManLugan> 5 words: Woolie Will Figure It Out
[3:26:16] <SinnerBeta> in other words, hoes mad
[3:26:16] <CasualAlohaFriday> "Stop explaining and accept your guilt!!!"
[3:26:21] <Nested_Dreams> "Woolie is not sea lion"
[3:26:26] <gunsrlove> Soeh Dam
[3:26:42] <%RioGascar> why am i being pm’d
[3:26:43] <DatAsuna> He's not
[3:26:48] <%RioGascar> from you zanco
[3:26:53] <DatAsuna> Sea lioning is a different thing
[3:26:54] <%andrei11dr> Just don't explain and get totally shit on :)
[3:26:58] <%RioGascar> im not a kotor master
[3:27:03] <%prime_name> Youtuber apologies
[3:27:04] <Reizie_Etherealm> The desire to understand does not exist in all people
[3:27:08] <RantingRavager> hasMods Here he goes explaining why he's wrong rather than explaining guilt.
[3:27:29] <RantingRavager> sarcasm btw
[3:27:36] <+Slimshazbot> oooohh yeah
[3:27:43] <+Slimshazbot> that's a hard sell for me too
[3:27:51] <ALTRNico> not a Woolie bait
[3:27:53] <DSD24> What are they talking about? a book?
[3:28:00] <Memdosu> Always judge a book by its cover LUL
[3:28:00] <+wunp_fxs> mmm
[3:28:01] <+GrassCannon> 9/10 of their faces are eyes
[3:28:04] <RantingRavager> "Wonderful Everyday"
[3:28:11] <BlueMoonBlues> aaaanimaaaayyy
[3:28:12] <nepwar> is this a kataka shoujo situation or is it anime weeb shit
[3:28:19] <RantingRavager> Oh no it's Anime
[3:28:24] <SinnerBeta> lot's of insight
[3:28:25] <Reizie_Etherealm> Looks about as old as Clannad and Higurashi
[3:28:29] <+Zanco23> Ew, anime
[3:28:30] <+MidnightBurst12> judging a book by it's color is like day 1 of "things not to do"
[3:28:32] <+wunp_fxs> oh that artstyke,,,,,'
[3:28:36] <DSD24> Oh I see it
[3:28:37] <%TheOneCalledRock> how to draw anime books
[3:28:39] <ALTRNico> just mod it so they have short hair
[3:28:41] <+SolidusRex> that's a you problem
[3:28:43] <RantingRavager> I mean, it looks fine
[3:28:45] <%TheOneCalledRock> they are not bad by default
[3:28:46] <%prime_name> YEYEYEYEYE
[3:28:47] <%TheOneCalledRock> but eh
[3:28:47] <RantingRavager> but I'm a huge weeb
[3:28:48] <%breakdancinghobo> *cough* Code Geass
[3:28:55] <TheRealSk1ll3s> its not shonen, so woolie is out
[3:28:56] <Reizie_Etherealm> It looks fine but it doesn't look great
[3:29:01] <+Zanco23> Let's not, and say we did...
[3:29:10] <%kyh9> @breakdancinghobo Everyone is a stick, because Clamps
[3:29:12] <Melchior_the_Wise> What show are we talking about?
[3:29:13] <DatAsuna> hope it's better than tri
[3:29:16] <snorlaxbud> Its so hype and it looks to be based on the movie for the first few episodes
[3:29:18] <legacy0117> Aw. Is the LP done already?
[3:29:20] <%GeneralSCPatton> WHEN WAIFUMONS THO?
[3:29:22] <nepwar> you have caught my attention
[3:29:23] <%prime_name> That's Tri
[3:29:27] <Ravenian96> Digimon World remake when
[3:29:27] <+wunp_fxs> oh I have to see that
[3:29:41] <%ozzrabbit> Ok, that’s a hot recommend. I’m going to go check it out.
[3:29:42] <TheRealSk1ll3s> tri abridged was fun
[3:29:44] <%TheOneCalledRock> i like the first few episodes of tri
[3:29:46] <%prime_name> Next Order is really fun
[3:29:47] <%TheOneCalledRock> the rest is eh
[3:29:52] <ALTRNico> Cyber Sleuth Kreygasm
[3:29:53] <DSD24> Cyber Sleuth is really fun!
[3:29:58] <atema128> Wonder if they’ll do Our War Game
[3:30:03] <Dangerzone979> Is this the break?
[3:30:03] <%Gruhunchously> @WoolieVersus The only reason you need to talk to Mira is because she has interesting things to say about Hanharr.
[3:30:12] <SinnerBeta> HOT TAKE: despite all the jokes with Maiden's fuck fighting, I think Woolie would appreciate Disciples story and dialogue more
[3:30:41] <DatAsuna> absolutely
[3:30:41] <%prime_name> Yes
[3:30:44] <ralphfromdk> Wait, who is fapping into the mic? What did i miss?
[3:30:44] <ALTRNico> kinda
[3:30:47] <DSD24> No I disagree
[3:30:48] <%jiggy_snipe> yes
[3:30:50] <Memdosu> yeah pretty much
[3:30:50] <%TheOneCalledRock> i agree
[3:30:54] <+MidnightBurst12> ehh
[3:30:57] <%prime_name> Unless there is a way to toggle out of first person, then why bother?
[3:30:58] <subjectg> I disagree
[3:31:04] <DatAsuna> I like first person, but don't make character customization a thing if it is
[3:31:05] <%kyh9> No, because HOW will I self-insert if I don't get to design my action figure?!
[3:31:05] <grandark_z317> that is a waste of resources at that point.
[3:31:07] <user_naim> No, they are not wasted
[3:31:08] <legacy0117> So, how far did Woolie get?
[3:31:11] <%TheOneCalledRock> if it was multiplayer then that is a different story
[3:31:13] <user_naim> are you crazy?
[3:31:18] <ALTRNico> I'd rather have character creation than nothing tbh
[3:31:18] <subjectg> there’s always room for personalization
[3:31:24] <nepwar> ehh i mean you customize your face/hair IRL but you never see it unless you look at a mirror
[3:31:25] <+wunp_fxs> Mirror and menus is where youll see it
[3:31:32] <+Bluemanzee> Cyberpunk will have cutscenes. Outer Worlds had none of that
[3:31:53] <user_naim> 3rd person might be preferrable, but it being a waste is hyperbole
[3:31:54] <subjectg> look at it this way, other people will be able to see your fashion
[3:31:59] <DSD24> I want to customize my character and just having it is a plus
[3:32:00] <CasualAlohaFriday> How many games allow you to switch on the fly between first person and third person over the shoulder?
[3:32:00] <subjectg> and gaze in fear
[3:32:03] <$Foopoof> Cheer10000
[3:32:04] <%Djinnazz> it's for OTHER ppl to see.
[3:32:06] <Tucker0603> reach was great cause cutscene
[3:32:08] <akman14> Metric prime?
[3:32:14] <+Slimshazbot> You may not see your Spartan much but other people do., That's most of the appeal
[3:32:16] <Dangerzone979> Why every game in 1st person doesn't model the entire body I do not know
[3:32:20] <%kyh9> in-universe
[3:32:24] <DatAsuna> well that's not in media res
[3:32:24] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1247403021576876032?s=20
[3:32:25] <CasualAlohaFriday> @akman14 Metroid Prime
[3:32:32] <ovlarigalnea> Give metroid fusion continuation
[3:32:40] <%kyh9> in-universe, not in-media-res
[3:32:42] <legacy0117> Metroid Priiime.
[3:32:45] <%jiggy_snipe> black desert but only 1st person
[3:32:46] <Reizie_Etherealm> I wish to appreciate as much as I can for the game that I play, being able to see things is one such way to maximize that.
[3:32:51] <%RioGascar> It doesnt really matter what you look like
[3:32:53] <DatAsuna> or skyrim where you have third person but it's a bad third person
[3:32:58] <+Slimshazbot> Outer Worlds having character creation was weird
[3:32:59] <RevaniteRyan> Seeing your Spartan in an assassination animation was always so satisfying
[3:33:02] <%Djinnazz> NIOH
[3:33:02] <hahyeahok> yeah true
[3:33:04] <grandark_z317> NIOH 2
[3:33:07] <akman14> What if you play in a vaccum ?
[3:33:10] <Ravenian96> Helmet toggle
[3:33:10] <+BioHunter> there a mod for helmets off
[3:33:12] <legacy0117> Twas.
[3:33:15] <user_naim> How much of your facial details do you even see in 3rd person?
[3:33:15] <Zouledge> swtor had that option oddly enough
[3:33:16] <DSD24> Nioh 2 has amazing character customization
[3:33:16] <SinnerBeta> @WoolieVersus you can do that in swtor, if you pay lol
[3:33:17] <Tucker0603> wrong
[3:33:19] <%jiggy_snipe> no
[3:33:20] <DatAsuna> it has third person it jsut sucks
[3:33:21] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> no
[3:33:21] <ovlarigalnea> Most games have a toggle now for helmets
[3:33:21] <Tucker0603> there is 3rd person
[3:33:25] <+Slimshazbot> since Morrowind
[3:33:25] <+wunp_fxs> but the camera combat switch is a pain
[3:33:26] <%kyh9> No, you just zoom out
[3:33:26] <legacy0117> You can switch it. Yepp.
[3:33:27] <+BioHunter> go to the work bench to turn helmets off
[3:33:27] <user_naim> there’s a mod for that
[3:33:29] <%GraceTBM> it just controls shit in 3rd person
[3:33:29] <NaturalGear> since Moprrowind yes
[3:33:29] <Torgue_1> Morrowind
[3:33:30] <%Javaa01> All the bethesda open world games have a third person toggle
[3:33:30] <nepwar> how have we got so far in games that their isn't the option for npc to have their helmets open out of combat
[3:33:35] <DatAsuna> It's not that it lacks third person, it's that it's bad
[3:33:36] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> oh man, we know what we are adding for Woolie to play now
[3:33:37] <%lotharrio> It's just terrible for aiming.
[3:33:39] <%kyh9> Also, kill animations are third person
[3:33:39] <Psyramics> That's Overwatch skins for me
[3:33:41] <%TheOneCalledRock> yeah but playing skyrim in third person is kinda awful
[3:33:42] <ralphfromdk> But the 3rd person in Skyrim is ass and jank compared to 1st person
[3:33:47] <%Javaa01> The third person animations are absolutely garbage, but you can do that
[3:33:50] <Dangerzone979> Mass Effect did helmets being optional right, in a safe enviroment they can stay off, the second you hit an unsafe one they go on
[3:33:52] <+wunp_fxs> nah, let cyberpunk be the one exception
[3:33:57] <%GeneralSCPatton> @megalomaniacalmegalodon 500 hour morrowind LP?
[3:33:57] <%SirGO0SE> woolieGASM
[3:33:58] <%jiggy_snipe> Cyberpunk will at least show your character alot tho
[3:34:02] <ALTRNico> CLAP
[3:34:02] <%mitchteck> But third person Skyrim is ass
[3:34:05] <%andrei11dr> Iea ,Dark Souls could use that helmet feature
[3:34:14] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> @GeneralSCPatton 4 year long LP
[3:34:17] <jaygee303> How much was it?
[3:34:19] <legacy0117> Thas a lotta BITS!
[3:34:22] <+gkingsausagelink> I'm replaying Skyrim rn and I do combat in first person but talking and adventuring is entirely 3rd person
[3:34:28] <%GeneralSCPatton> @megalomaniacalmegalodon Delicious
[3:34:36] <%RioGascar> No one does it cause it sucks
[3:34:41] <ALTRNico> PogChamp
[3:34:54] <%lotharrio> But wait, which is it?! Are you or not?!
[3:34:59] <DatAsuna> third person needs mods to allign the positioning
[3:35:00] <%andrei11dr> I just realized that this hole session was nothing but talking LUL
[3:35:05] <Dangerzone979> But what direction is the Slash V?
[3:35:08] <Hopit> Is V's channel a recommended/suggested channel on Woolies youtubes?
[3:35:09] <DatAsuna> fallout 4 did generally improve the camera and animation
[3:35:11] <%Gruhunchously> Tole you so
[3:35:13] <+wunp_fxs> Cya then!
[3:35:17] <RantingRavager> Cya~
[3:35:21] <AMaidIndeed> I feel like I should immediately subscribe to that specific channel immediately
[3:35:24] <RantingRavager> How long is the break? 3 hours?
[3:35:27] <ALTRNico> SourPls
[3:35:28] <%Djinnazz> HOES MADX@$
[3:35:33] <atema128> Cya!
[3:35:37] <%Javaa01> Though Fallout 4 farmed out a lot of the first person animation to other studios under Bethesda
[3:35:38] <%andrei11dr> woolieF woolieU
[3:35:44] <%Javaa01> So they had competent people working on those
[3:35:50] <%andrei11dr> So Dantooine next probably
[3:35:55] <DonatelloJose> Seeya later fuckers
[3:36:02] <%GeneralSCPatton> BUT
[3:36:07] <ALTRNico> BUT!
[3:36:08] <+Bluemanzee> @RantingRavager Like 1 hour 20 minutes I think, give or take a few minutes
[3:36:10] <DatAsuna> even though a bunch fo the reload animations in first person don't make sense and clip
[3:36:15] <%lotharrio> I'd put money on Onderon, then to Dantooine during the "cooldown."
[3:36:16] <BallerSwagBro9k> BEST OUTRO OF ALL TIME
[3:36:22] <ovlarigalnea> Kreygam
[3:36:32] <BallerSwagBro9k> BUUUUT
[3:36:33] <geedeegames> Oh shit
[3:36:37] <hard_bop_sax_solo> is this bible black?
[3:36:39] <geedeegames> Is the stream finished?
[3:36:42] <BallerSwagBro9k> Yes
[3:36:58] <user_naim> good soundtrack tho
[3:37:00] <ovlarigalnea> Dissapointeeeeeeed
[3:37:11] <+Bluemanzee> @geedeegames They're coming back after a break
[3:37:12] <ALTRNico> dissapointeeeed
[3:37:16] <%Javaa01> Just like don't
[3:37:21] <DatAsuna> thanks girl
[3:37:25] <%GeneralSCPatton> Bible Black occupies this space in my brain where it's too weird to believe that it's real.
[3:37:30] <+Bluemanzee> BUT!
[3:37:31] <ALTRNico> BUT!
[3:37:31] <+gkingsausagelink> the outro changed since I was last here
[3:37:37] <%chiluzza> BUT!
[3:38:04] <ovlarigalnea> Physco mantis?
[3:38:31] <ALTRNico> aughaughaughaughaugh
[3:38:53] <ovlarigalnea> BISON
[3:38:58] <TheRealSk1ll3s> BISON!
[3:40:00] <+Captain_Spicy_> AUGHHHH
[3:40:00] <Sulliman34> what the hell did i just step into
[3:40:00] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[3:40:22] <asurite_warrior> I forgot will they be back later today or are they done for now
[3:40:37] <+RJay80> they will be back
[3:40:46] <+RJay80> hour or so
[3:41:15] <DatAsuna> hour and a quarter
[3:41:19] <DatAsuna> estimate
[3:41:47] <DatAsuna> when's namco x capcom lp?
[3:42:34] <SinnerBeta> we need a new vegas LP next, Woolie talk fighting Caesar
[3:43:04] <DatAsuna> I'd enjoy that too
[3:43:12] <Hopit> Is there a list where these things in the outro are listed? I recognize some of them and some look interesting
[3:43:24] <umbracatalyst> I just checked in and why is the stream thumbnail look like a chick from bible black what is happening??
[3:43:41] <Zouledge> @SinnerBeta that would be awesome, also kinda hoping for a jade empire LP.
[3:43:43] <shodoblanka1> Best intro
[3:43:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> @zouledge Jade Empire would be rad
[3:44:30] <%GeneralSCPatton> Anyone got any ideas to help facilitate a Planescape Torment LP? It needs to happen.
[3:44:31] <Zouledge> @GeneralSCPatton though would he go open palm or closed fist ?
[3:44:35] <SinnerBeta> @Zouledge didn't play that one yet, but I heard good things
[3:44:35] <umbracatalyst> Oh thats why, fighting game, well stream lagging explains that perfectly
[3:44:40] <DatAsuna> indeed it would
[3:45:01] <Zouledge> @SinnerBeta its an old bioware RPG but imo still holds up pretty well

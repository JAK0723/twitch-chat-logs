[0:00:04] <%LuckyLagomorph> Yeah twitch was down for a bit
[0:00:08] <%psidefx> live
[0:00:29] <%Josef_Stryker> Finally getting back to that snoof
[0:00:38] <%nxflre> Twitch dying
[0:00:38] <%sparkly_yoyo> I thought Woolie was gonna push the LP an hour later
[0:00:52] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYEYYEYE
[0:00:57] <+Euphbugg> It was delayed by a hour, Woolie on twitter said he had to delay by an hour due to stuff
[0:01:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SourPls
[0:01:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> MESSENGER OST BAYBEE
[0:01:19] <%sparkly_yoyo> oh well
[0:01:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Twitch was down earlier
[0:01:35] <%sparkly_yoyo> Nice to see I'm on time by pure dumb luck
[0:01:51] <+Euphbugg> but it matters not now, for soon it shall begin
[0:01:55] <%AJiiij> eyyyyy I just finished studying
[0:02:17] <+twohitgood> woolie should do origami king after this.
[0:02:25] <%Prevot> no
[0:02:29] <%Prevot> just no
[0:02:36] <+twohitgood> yes. just yes.
[0:02:38] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Origami King is a clamity on mankind
[0:02:39] <+BestTeaMaker> origami king is fine
[0:02:41] <+CharredChord> Yeah nag
[0:02:41] <%AJiiij> I watched some gameplay and didn't like it tbh, why not have him play super paper mario? its not turn based, I know
[0:02:49] <%sparkly_yoyo> I actually wish Woolie did either Mario&Luigi one or Seven Stars
[0:02:54] <%ozmon> Spicy music, I should probably pick up The Messenger at some point
[0:02:54] <+BestTeaMaker> it's not a bad game, it's just not an rpg people wanted
[0:03:00] <%Prevot> now Mario & Luigi, that would be fire
[0:03:19] <+Euphbugg> Origami King is ok, but I know I would go with Super or original paper mario if he continued down this road
[0:03:21] <+BestTeaMaker> you weirdos jumping on origami king's throat without having even touched it yourselves
[0:03:25] <%Proxzo> HERE WE GO
[0:03:25] <%AJiiij> ehh mario and Luigi are alright, they lack the character this game has tho. imo
[0:03:27] <+Agentoracle> I'm up to date on the anime, how far ahead is the manga?
[0:03:33] <%chosenjuan42> FROG FRACTIONS
[0:03:36] <+CharredChord> M&L SS would be good since it’s short
[0:03:38] <+twohitgood> I actually played the game. it's not all great but it will make for a good LP. it's a good mix of good and bad.
[0:03:40] <DavidDredd84> Yo anyone down to give me like a two sentence story recap
[0:03:46] <ScandalousSam262> i'd love to see the bois revisit Sonic Smackdown since theres been a bunch of characters added since they last covered it
[0:03:55] <scorpionoutcast> Who’s ready for the second-most bullshit backtracking in the entire game?
[0:04:03] <+Agentoracle> @daviddredd84 Peach took a shower, events transpired from there.
[0:04:10] <%AJiiij> lool whys he gonna backtrack?
[0:04:11] <%ozmon> Origami King is a surprisingly good game, combat's a bit weak here and there. But it's not at all related to Paper Mario, so you don't have to group them together
[0:04:16] <%Prevot> TEC got formatted
[0:04:20] <+Euphbugg> It's ok, with their math skills increased from tuesday they will be fine
[0:04:21] <ghoulishcripple> Bowser's Inside Story is pretty funny and that remake came out
[0:04:31] <%sparkly_yoyo> Is there an RPG (apart from Bug Fables) that a Paper Mario fan would enjoy?
[0:04:42] <%Josef_Stryker> SourPls
[0:04:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SourPls
[0:04:46] <ScandalousSam262> has peach found tec's hard drive yet? Kappa
[0:04:49] <%JD_Lars> DOGCHAMP psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[0:04:51] <%AJiiij> if they enjoy the ending of this game then maybe they should just continue with the paper mario Canon woolieMINHMAX woolieMINHMAX woolieMINHMAX

[0:05:09] <DavidDredd84> @Agentoracle thanks
[0:05:14] <DavidDredd84> Kreygasm
[0:05:17] <+Agentoracle> @ajiiij I wouldn't wish sticker star or color splash on anyone.
[0:05:19] <ghoulishcripple> I wouldn't be opposed to seeing Woolie's reactions to super pap mario
[0:05:48] <%AJiiij> @agentoracle I didn't like either of those 2, I will admit yeah
[0:05:53] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BTW I finished Gurren Lagan today. FUCKING AMAZING
[0:06:07] <%Prevot> I never sold my physical Sticker Star because I can't in good conscience subjet another human being to that piece of shit
[0:06:33] <ghoulishcripple> I wonder has Woolie played legend of the crystal stars? if not thatd be fun.
[0:06:34] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:06:37] <%sparkly_yoyo> Only problem with Super Paper Mario is that the items are useless
[0:06:59] <%AJiiij> @sparkly_yoyo lmao oh i don't even remember using items LUL
[0:07:12] <%chosenjuan42> been rewatching Pat play Mario RPG. that game is gold
[0:07:22] <%sparkly_yoyo> some items had minigames even
[0:07:24] <ghoulishcripple> woolie didnt use them for half of ttyd @sparkly_yoyo
[0:07:31] <%GeneralSCPatton> @ballerswagbro9k Congrats. Very few things you experience will ever escalate that hard again. Asura's Wrath is the only other contender that comes to mind.
[0:07:31] <%sparkly_yoyo> what a waste of dev time
[0:07:32] <scorpionoutcast> That’s fine. Woolie barely uses items anyway
[0:07:34] <%Proxzo> Origami King is a game with a lot of great things. Soundtrack is, I think, the best of the series.
[0:07:35] <%ozmon> And Bowser's broke
[0:07:46] <%Proxzo> Also I really liked OK's boss fights
[0:07:50] <%AJiiij> @sparkly_yoyo wow if that was implemented well that sounds like a cool idea tho
[0:07:56] <NotHereToStream> bruh this remix
[0:08:01] <%Josef_Stryker> Memories of EVO Moment 37
[0:08:11] <%sparkly_yoyo> I dunno man, I don't like the Jazz thing Mario has going on, I prefer the weird electronic style from this game
[0:08:14] <ghoulishcripple> I love the aesthetic of OK more than anything else in it.
[0:08:17] <%SirGO0SE> woolieCHAN woolieCHAN
[0:08:26] <%AJiiij> origami does look better than sticker or color, to me
[0:08:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @GeneralSCPatton Thanks. The only things I can think of is The Wonderful 101
[0:08:31] <%SirGO0SE> man i missed this game
[0:08:36] <DrDenorax> Yo, this shit slaps.
[0:08:39] <%Prevot> I still hate the fucking white outline new Paper Mario has
[0:08:41] <%chosenjuan42> woolies build is trying enough to warrant not using attacking items. however he is a glass cannon
[0:08:42] <+gingersnipsnap> I'm getting a It takes two to make a thing go right, vibe from this song
[0:08:50] <%Proxzo> OK's OST was done by TTYD's composer
[0:08:58] <%doomerskeletor13> It’s been 84 years...
[0:09:16] <%GenericSoda> @prevot i miss the old pixel sprites from the original. TTYD looks so flat when animared by comparison
[0:09:19] <armchairmaster_> Yo, apparently there's this chinese game being woked on that's basically if Sekiro met Wukong
[0:09:20] <%chosenjuan42> As long as woolie at minimum clears to cook syrups with mushrooms he would be in a much better place
[0:09:21] <%SirGO0SE> @gingersnipsnap i mean they definitely sampled it haha
[0:09:23] <%yusefHD> gooteks LUL LUL PogChamp
[0:09:23] <%doomerskeletor13> Origami’s soundtrack SLAPS
[0:09:23] <%sparkly_yoyo> @Prevot I couldn't agree more, it looks like dookie

[0:09:36] <%GeneralSCPatton> @ballerswagbro9k Ok, we have a Holy Trinity of Hype Escalation
[0:09:37] <%Proxzo> They also did SPM's ost. OK ost is definitely Metal focused. SS was Jazz.

[0:14:22] <%sparkly_yoyo> did you reach the halo?
[0:14:23] <%SirGO0SE> tell him about the cole protocol

[0:14:32] <%doomerskeletor13> The Buck Protocol
[0:14:41] <@akuda_bar> @gunsrlove late because of a tough morning, that's all
[0:14:42] <Darren716> Damn that is an apt analogy
[0:14:45] <%KyoryUtchy> Origami King is fun, but it's a different ~kind~ of fun to TTYD. TTYD is great at being a "traditional" JRPG, while OK strong point is that you're doing a ton of weird stuff and the turn based battles are only one part of the equation.
[0:14:45] <%chosenjuan42> Paul Marketing says the War never ends
[0:14:46] <Solidnick18> no it is not
[0:14:47] <%doomerskeletor13> It’s super Rogue One

[0:15:15] <Darren716> He has 2 more missions before credits
[0:15:21] <%SirGO0SE> that reaction gif of reggie is gold
[0:15:26] <+Euphbugg> Math powers will only help Paper Mario
[0:15:26] <%dekubaka> he's pretty near the endgame of ttyd
[0:15:26] <@akuda_bar> do you really need math when there's only two dimensions
[0:15:35] <%chosenjuan42> Reggie's Math is at MAX level

[0:17:03] <%sparkly_yoyo> :(
[0:17:06] <ghoulishcripple> @sparkly_yoyo it was like a mid game mission. you go to a safehouse hidden behind a gross busted Gellato shop and the owner is a pretty racial stereotype. game was weird

[0:17:54] <%Proxzo> When you have expensive drawing tablets that use older mini-usbs that break the port inside the device

[0:18:26] <valriot> *PS4
[0:18:27] <ScandalousSam262> i think my ps4 controller has a weird form of drift? everytime i press L2, the controller acts as if im holding the left stick forward
[0:18:28] <%sparkly_yoyo> insertion makes things loose
[0:18:30] <%sparkly_yoyo> RULES OF NATURE
[0:18:32] <ghoulishcripple> @sparkly_yoyo I feel like there's a moment that dude smashes a roach on Gellato and offers it to you
[0:18:40] <CrematedCube> I have destroyed many headphone ports by tripping and use small extension cords as a tripguard, so I get why they're protecting the port
[0:19:12] <+RocketBarrel> I wished PS4 controllers could mod in TypeC
[0:19:34] <Darren716> C-ing it
[0:19:35] <%dekubaka> speaking of ports who else is fucking pissed at losing the headphone jack in phones
[0:19:38] <%Prevot> thank fuck Switch already had it
[0:19:52] <%BinaryFireball> I literally don't understand how you guys are breaking wires so often
[0:20:06] <sunnythedrunk> Removing headphones jacks is the grimiest technology move I've ever seen

[0:20:32] <%sparkly_yoyo> some people just live a WIRELIFE
[0:20:38] <+RocketBarrel> @binaryfireball because it breaks from sheer USE or if you drop your controller from 2 feet
[0:20:41] <Solidnick18> um
[0:20:42] <%BinaryFireball> I have had only one break in like 5 years

[0:21:16] <@akuda_bar> cable god
[0:21:21] <%Ahnassi> Not everyone uses those damn cables as nunchucks
[0:21:23] <%BinaryFireball> i am that one guy today
[0:21:28] <ScandalousSam262> i imagine woolie's setup just looks like his hair
[0:21:31] <+RocketBarrel> yup
[0:21:32] <%sparkly_yoyo> I try to keeps wiring to a minimum, now my parents, on the other hand, I've counted at least 60, without extensions
[0:21:33] <ThighsSupreme> Sounds like a lack of guests
[0:21:38] <prime_name> I remember how much of a pain it was to plug in everything for Video Game club in high school.
[0:21:38] <%GodlyLuigi> fireball have you every heard how HARD woolie holds a controller
[0:21:39] <@akuda_bar> I met this professional IT dude who had a fancy binder entirely for wires
[0:21:39] <+NickHatesSnow> I do IT so I get it
[0:21:43] <Solidnick18> Woolies wire world
[0:21:48] <%Irridium> At this point I treat my USB-b stuff as wired things. never unplug them anymore. Primarily my PS4 and Xbone controllers because those seem to break the easiest on me
[0:21:59] <%yusefHD> been on a 4 month job hunt and you guys keep me sane fr BibleThump
[0:22:05] <CrematedCube> I mean... I have a Dreamcast that never needed a repair. Some people get good luck
[0:22:18] <+RocketBarrel> I bought Micro USB 3 weeks ago and it broke in 3 days because I dropped my controller
[0:22:20] <+NickHatesSnow> OH THOSE ARE THE WORST
[0:22:23] <%dekubaka> @yusefhd stay strong out there buddy
[0:22:29] <%Prevot> yeah Dualshock 4 you might as well leave plugged in, not only because of the USB but the battery itself being garbage
[0:22:34] <%Seancicle> 🤙🏿🤙🏻
[0:22:35] <Darren716> Ive had that happen on phone chargers, its the worse
[0:22:41] <%yusefHD> yerrr woolieSHOOK
[0:22:48] <CrematedCube> I've heard of Woolie's Dreamcast graveyard
[0:22:52] <%BinaryFireball> I am so confused
[0:22:55] <%krispen_wa> The absolute worst gen of USB
[0:22:56] <%sparkly_yoyo> oh i HATE THAT
[0:22:59] <%oadf_threestrikes> my phone charger wires get fucked up so fast
[0:23:08] <%AJiiij> I got cousins that make fun of me for buying a new controller ever 2-3 years, yet when I visit them their shit is always broken sbfpSetIn
[0:23:09] <JetpackMcQuack> JetpackMcQuack subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! Persona 4 Golden is a masterpiece but I have one question: What was Persona like before Mr Edogawa's TV Classroom?
[0:23:13] <+RocketBarrel> YEP THE WIRE EXPOSURE
[0:23:18] <%Irridium> @Prevot and then you sometimes get the fun glitch where the PS4 doesn't recognize the wire and thinks its a headset so you keep getting the "headset disconnected" message when doing anything
[0:23:19] <Grahfvitnir> Thanks for the HyperMayhem @jetpackmcquack
[0:23:20] <+RocketBarrel> FUCK IT
[0:23:23] <ThighsSupreme> Apple wires suck the big time

[1:17:30] <%eriksdrums> According to Bill Bryson's "At Home", there was a point in time where the common knowledge in 17th(?) century England where peasants were told to rub dirt on their skin to clog up their pores
[1:17:36] <%ozmon> Huh, didn't work
[1:17:36] <%Rosen_Thorne> i'm honestly shocked there's nothing

[1:20:54] <+jiggy_snipe> people do it all the time
[1:20:55] <Solidnick18> some do
[1:20:58] <%Papa_Bearman> Luigi obviously didn't write these.
[1:20:59] <%kyh9> I think he's really going on this adventure tho
[1:21:00] <%GeneralSCPatton> kusa
[1:21:02] <cosmicgoatee> Tulpa fantasy Luigi
[1:21:07] <+StrawberryPantsu> Luigi IS TELLING THE TRUTH
[1:21:07] <%ChoculaUltra> I just got chills thinking about a rebranding like...Luigi Party or Luigi Kart. It just doesn't have the same zing

[1:21:16] <+Huttersson> I just think this is ghostwritten by someone else tbh

[1:21:18] <noe_juan_kanobe> RIP Daisy
[1:21:19] <%Prevot> honestly some people are like that
[1:21:19] <DatAsuna> people do it all the time
[1:21:20] <%sparkly_yoyo> Can you imagine writing a narcissistic autobiography?
[1:21:23] <grimshuck> DSP?
[1:21:25] <%Livelinne> shiaCry shiaCry shiaCry
[1:21:26] <%GenericSoda> maybe the editor is punching up the script
[1:21:26] <%LuckyLagomorph> Luigi didn't write these
[1:21:28] <NotHereToStream> history is written by the victors and victors are always liars
[1:21:32] <%kyh9> I think they're actually happening tho?
[1:21:32] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> right
[1:21:33] <Mr_Mushie> neither
[1:21:35] <%SirGO0SE> maybe the publisher just wants to make a buck LUL
[1:21:37] <%Rosen_Thorne> considering he told mario the truth, probably the former.
[1:21:37] <DatAsuna> imagine being mickey rourke
[1:21:39] <SixthSun2> @WoolieVersus The river in these warp rooms leads to something
[1:21:42] <%chosenjuan42> Ghost writer punching it up
[1:21:43] <%oadf_threestrikes> He is going on the adventure I think. but damn the published book is written by some. questionable people
[1:21:43] <cosmicgoatee> @grimshuck DSP tries falsifying his existence
[1:21:44] <%Prevot> so, delusional or liar
[1:21:45] <+jiggy_snipe> no one ever tells the truth about the past
[1:21:48] <%ozmon> What if it's the author who's putting words in Luigi's honest, naive mouth
[1:21:48] <CrematedCube> Big advice: Cook some of your dried bouquets with some dried mushrooms
[1:21:48] <%kyh9> Wait, isn't Luigi actually going on these adventures?
[1:21:53] <%jinking79> sounds like someone with a perfectionist or god complex loser
[1:21:53] <dizimous> Dumbass lowkey needs to be thrown into a TV
[1:21:55] <%MayorRev> I'm pretty sure his writer is embellishing things
[1:22:02] <CrematedCube> You'll get good results and get some space
[1:22:09] <%Lion_kun> Maybe Luigi's brother is just salty.
[1:22:09] <%ringabal> Reminder that Luigi's Brawl Final Smash is an AT Field emitted by all the Negativity in his heart.
[1:22:18] <DavidComic> luigi is going on these adventures but he keeps winning while doing nothing
[1:22:18] <noe_juan_kanobe> Luigi hired ghostwriter to punch it up
[1:22:19] <+SlappyMeats> fake mammaries are also a thing
[1:22:22] <%chirochan224> But if Luigi was writing they story, everyone would be a super preganat
[1:22:23] <+jiggy_snipe> yea human memory is garbage
[1:22:26] <SixthSun2> Noooo, the boat panel in this room NotLikeThis
[1:22:26] <%dekubaka> we know it's not him telling the story because of the last volume ;)
[1:22:29] <%Rosen_Thorne> oh yeah the new stage
[1:22:30] <%sparkly_yoyo> remember every time you won in life? fake memories
[1:22:34] <Solidnick18> i been their before
[1:22:36] <%chosenjuan42> What if Luigi is telling the truth but the whole world is lying?
[1:22:37] <prime_name> Is all of this just a fake memory?
[1:22:38] <%SirGO0SE> yeah I've created scenariors that I found out later never happened
[1:22:39] <DatAsuna> that's not sometimes reggie
[1:22:40] <Nomad94> you really can't trust your memory that much
[1:22:48] <DavidComic> Luigi might actually be ill
[1:22:54] <DatAsuna> that's inherent to the function of memory
[1:22:54] <%Proxzo> Whoa, Goombella doing 10
[1:22:55] <Solidnick18> i think some of them where dreams but idk
[1:22:59] <cosmicgoatee> dont forget you can jump up to grab pipes
[1:23:04] <DatAsuna> it's every time
[1:23:04] <%hamahiroyuki> gaslighting you say then
[1:23:05] <Solidnick18> oh cool badge
[1:23:05] <%Proxzo> LOOT
[1:23:09] <%GeneralSCPatton> Your memories get slightly rewritten every time you recall them.
[1:23:11] <%ChoculaUltra> imagine the biggest memories in your life being something your brain just constructed monkaS
[1:23:12] <%sparkly_yoyo> stop badgering my witness!
[1:23:17] <SixthSun2> @WoolieVersus You missed a boat panel back in that room
[1:23:20] <DatAsuna> memory is not a read/write operation
[1:23:23] <%Prevot> don't tell Edgeworth that
[1:23:23] <%Rosen_Thorne> so does luigi keep his ghost writer in his mansion?
[1:23:23] <Mr_Mushie> I mean you can talk to him
[1:23:27] <+caskit_case> luigi: american sniper
[1:23:31] <Mr_Mushie> the author
[1:23:33] <%kyh9> No, he's not the writer, I don't believe
[1:23:37] <%sparkly_yoyo> Luigi is too busy having ADVENTURE
[1:23:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> because he personally tells you the story?
[1:23:40] <CrematedCube> And he has partners, who confirm his big fat lies
[1:23:40] <+SlappyMeats> but if Luigi is illiterate... klinkHmm
[1:23:42] <DatAsuna> it's why brain transfer stories are always weird
[1:23:46] <%ringabal> The author was actually Luigi's ghost dog
[1:23:50] <+Euphbugg> Ceiling to your left as well
[1:23:50] <%Rosen_Thorne> also ceiling pipes
[1:23:53] <%GenericSoda> have you ever seen luigi write
[1:23:53] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> down
[1:23:53] <%ozmon> It's definitely his partners who really tell you the story straight
[1:23:53] <%glass_marcus> I just love the layers of embelishment from person to person
[1:23:56] <%chosenjuan42> go down
[1:23:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> if memories are just brain chemicals or electrical synapses, can you zap memories into a brain?
[1:23:57] <%Irridium> written by igiul
[1:23:57] <citerel> is the writer the guy in rogueport?
[1:23:58] <SixthSun2> Below

[1:28:40] <gya0s> may as well get the xps and stylish training
[1:28:48] <ShiningAxis> they may be weak, but they're stronger than the execution
[1:29:10] <gya0s> das a good badge.
[1:29:23] <gya0s> i think you have one though
[1:29:25] <ScatterCatt> OMG Woolie's sleeves blend in with his couch, so I thought his arms were both over the back of the couch or something. I was so confused!

[1:50:13] <%sparkly_yoyo> Mario cuts a bloody swath across the region
[1:50:14] <gya0s> Koops doesn't even have collision with them. terrifying.
[1:50:24] <shiny_prinny> unless Amazy Dayzee prevents first attack
[1:50:29] <+TheRisingPride> They are less than nothing to koops
[1:50:31] <%chosenjuan42> (!)
[1:50:40] <gya0s> Amazy Dayzee does not appear in the overworld.
[1:50:45] <Darren716> Are they still on the food quest?
[1:50:49] <%ChoculaUltra> is Koops a 3 dimensional entity in a 2 dimensional world?

[1:55:58] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i think dizzy is whiff
[1:55:59] <%chosenjuan42> sometimes whiff
[1:56:01] <whiteblacklight74> whiff
[1:56:05] <%ChoculaUltra> so what are the good Paper Mario games? TTYD and the 1st one?
[1:56:12] <+Onlysamfisher > ^
[1:56:16] <whiteblacklight74> it's SMT panic
[1:56:17] <HomebrewdRPG> super is good too
[1:56:18] <Doomstricken> superstar saga
[1:56:21] <gya0s> Super is very different, but sick imo
[1:56:23] <%Papa_Bearman> @ChoculaUltra First three.
[1:56:24] <%sparkly_yoyo> All except Sticker Star are good for different reasons
[1:56:25] <%Rosen_Thorne> @choculaultra all of them except sticker star from what I understand
[1:56:30] <+pectusumbra> yeah, panic is deadly. same in EO
[1:56:31] <Blunder_Blue> @ChoculaUltra 1, TTYD, and Super's STORY is good. Gameplay is kinda alright.
[1:56:32] <%SirGO0SE> GAME OVER YEAH
[1:56:33] <CrematedCube> Super Paper Mario is different yes but also good
[1:56:33] <%sparkly_yoyo> That said, first three are best
[1:56:34] <%Chatterbox1991> GAME OVER YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
[1:56:36] <+TheRisingPride> @ChoculaUltra Those 2 and Super are most well regarded, Color splash has fun writing but bad gameplay
[1:56:37] <Zohare> I like FF7's spinning confusion the most
[1:56:44] <HomebrewdRPG> i do not accept color splash you heathens
[1:56:46] <Doomstricken> superstar saga is a great paper mario game
[1:56:55] <%chosenjuan42> flurries fog, lucky badges, dodgy cape, confused enemies leads to ULTRA INSTINCT
[1:56:57] <%Papa_Bearman> Super Paper Mario is a draw mostly for the story. The gameplay really depends on your tastes.
[1:57:06] <%ringabal> [B L O C K E D]
[1:57:06] <whiteblacklight74> tetrakarn + makarakarn
[1:57:06] <+pectusumbra> almighty bypasses those generally
[1:57:07] <%Papa_Bearman> You can get the pipe in this room.
[1:57:07] <%sparkly_yoyo> Confusion in RPG never makes sense,
[1:57:12] <%DensityD> VIOLENCE
[1:57:15] <%ChoculaUltra> ah I see I see. Gonna give Superstar Saga a spin this weekend
[1:57:21] <cosmicgoatee> @woolieversus remember the up high chest in the sewers?
[1:57:27] <+BlockingDisabled> Megido spells arent affected IIRC
[1:57:31] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> sleep
[1:57:31] <shiny_prinny> i think you do
[1:57:31] <whiteblacklight74> megidolaon actually ignores makarakarn @woolieversus
[1:57:36] <%dekubaka> @sparkly_yoyo disagree,nI get confused all the time and sometimes I hurt myself
[1:57:36] <%Papa_Bearman> You can sleep in the cabin to make time go faster.
[1:57:37] <%sparkly_yoyo> play the advance/ds games, the 3DS one got neutered
[1:57:40] <grimshuck> you do

[2:08:19] <CrematedCube> I can't sleep on public transit because that fear is always too strong

[2:42:11] <ShiningAxis> it goes into the void
[2:42:14] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> lose it
[2:42:14] <CrematedCube> It vanishes

[2:42:56] <%doomerskeletor13> *invest
[2:43:07] <Darren716> no
[2:43:10] <canadianogre> huh
[2:43:11] <%CommanderSqueaks> It doesn't depreciate!
[2:43:14] <%Proxzo> you can't get more gold past 999
[2:43:14] <sunnythedrunk> no
[2:43:14] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> the Max
[2:43:17] <+jiggy_snipe> gotta protect against that currency devaluation
[2:43:19] <dinnydanny777> Is Mario running a Cash 4 Gold scheme, like one of those adverts that used to be on TV
[2:43:20] <@akuda_bar> nothing like that exists, no
[2:43:22] <cosmicgoatee> imagine spending money on anything less than luxury fu fu fu
[2:43:25] <%Starlight_Gamer> ?
[2:43:27] <%Proxzo> so you store it so you can have more than 999 gold
[2:43:30] <gya0s> running away, plus you can't gather coins in the overworld when you're at max
[2:43:36] <%sparkly_yoyo> you can only lose coins by running away
[2:43:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> As long as you're not a COWARD.
[2:43:46] <%dekubaka> the only thing that can take your items iirc is a big bandit
[2:43:52] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> 999 can only go to gold
[2:43:54] <Darren716> If you're maxed out youre losing potential gold
[2:43:54] <%doomerskeletor13> The Gold elf’s will try to steal your gold while you sleep, duh

[2:50:09] <%sparkly_yoyo> out here changing lives
[2:50:11] <%Papa_Bearman> Honestly, Woolie, after your "Towel Tech" story, I was skeptical.
[2:50:13] <%chosenjuan42> WOOLIE 100% CORRECT
[2:50:14] <%dollarstored> @WoolieVersus crazy things white people say
[2:50:15] <Daniel_Is_I> Woolie you do realize that the bottom chips are going to taste better if you eat it right-side up based on that logic, yes?
[2:50:17] <+StrawberryPantsu> The dust doesn't fall though sou you end up with the bad chips at the end
[2:50:19] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @thatguychris93 watch the podcast lol

[2:50:32] <%Livelinne> woolieFABRICATION woolieFABRICATION woolieFABRICATION
[2:50:36] <%krispen_wa> BOTTOM PEEL GANG
[2:50:37] <reonome> i do that
[2:50:38] <ghoulishcripple> just shake the fucking bag
[2:50:41] <zeif00> Potato chips aren't keto btw
[2:50:42] <%SirGO0SE> backward? stem is the holder
[2:50:42] <%chiluzza> you wont get the stringy bits
[2:50:44] <damienlunas> Bottom Peel is the fucking tech
[2:50:56] <%Papa_Bearman> After your "Towel Tech" thing that didn't work for me, I just felt like you were a crazy guy in front of a bulletin board with a bunch of pushpins and yarn.
[2:50:58] <+MagiKestral> either way is fine as long as you get out 90% of the banana
[2:51:01] <abelincoln_catpuncher> botton peel is soooo much easierb
[2:51:02] <+TheRisingPride> You're right
[2:51:05] <Solidnick18> i can't eat bananas so i'm good
[2:51:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> Bottom Peel gets rid of the strings.
[2:51:05] <%kyh9> JUST PUT THE LOGO RIGHT SIDE UP
[2:51:06] <straycatrock> just eat the peel why is everyone throwing away free nutrients
[2:51:07] <PhantomMaskJr> Believing in what Pat says majinoHooksubs
[2:51:07] <cosmicgoatee> is this hating on banana chips? Oh
[2:51:07] <%glass_marcus> Bottom peel is just easier 100% of the time
[2:51:11] <%Prevot> bowl gang will always be superior
[2:51:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> Bottom Peel is 100% better tech
[2:51:19] <%kyh9> STOP FUCKING WITH ME WOOLIE, PUT THE LOGO RIGHT, IT CANT BE OFF
[2:51:25] <cosmicgoatee> I like dried pineapple pieces but only occasionally
[2:51:26] <%sparkly_yoyo> Reversible logos, that's gonna be the gamechanger
[2:51:27] <damienlunas> The bag opens better at the top
[2:51:30] <allmightythunder> Invest in reversable logo chip bags
[2:51:34] <%yusefHD> look at sunhilegends likes woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM
[2:51:36] <%kyh9> NO, YOURE A HERETIC
[2:51:38] <+MechArch> what if you stored it at home upside down?
[2:51:45] <%kyh9> That's all very reasonable but we have to burn heretics
[2:51:46] <Skeletonmanners> just dump the shit into a bowl and dont have this dump convo
[2:51:54] <+blaze__drag> ULTIMATE PRO TECH IDEA: what if you just store the bags upside down
[2:51:55] <%sparkly_yoyo> pringles are doomed
[2:51:59] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> you cant flip it
[2:52:04] <cosmicgoatee> Pringles are even tubed
[2:52:06] <Zohare> Pringles are always broken and terrible for me
[2:52:06] <henshin2289> OOC WOOLIE Gravity mean bottom become top. XD
[2:52:10] <%ringabal> I have Woolie to thank for teaching his Cupcake tech
[2:52:10] <%SirGO0SE> pringles are not good bang for your buck but they rule
[2:52:16] <+TheRisingPride> Okay, I'm gonna apply a separate tech. When I bring the chip home, I'll store the bag upside down so that when I open it, I can do it rightside up
[2:52:24] <CrematedCube> Your analogy is bad
[2:52:28] <%Prevot> pringles are bougie chips
[2:52:34] <cosmicgoatee> Pizza Pringles > All except maybe bbq
[2:52:40] <Daniel_Is_I> Woolie, the "better" chips are at the bottom anyway. You're just reversing the order, you're not distributing shit.
[2:52:42] <big_booty_animemilf> just open bag from the middle
[2:52:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> Untrue
[2:52:45] <+jiggy_snipe> no
[2:52:46] <%chosenjuan42> BAG MILK
[2:52:50] <ghoulishcripple> commit woolie. flip the cereal
[2:52:53] <damienlunas> Opening the banana from the top works less than 100% of the time, bottom opening works EVERY TIME.
[2:52:54] <+jiggy_snipe> you empty the bag anyway
[2:52:55] <SixthSun2> And YET you Canadians drink BAGGED MILK
[2:52:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> Bottom peel is better tech.
[2:52:58] <CrematedCube> The bottom-banana tech makes it easier to open
[2:53:08] <%SirGO0SE> bottom is the new top in all scenarios
[2:53:09] <+AbnormalVoid> Pringles also suck
[2:53:11] <ghoulishcripple> do you flip you Bagged Milk Woolie?
[2:53:12] <cosmicgoatee> I have literally heard of banana bottom strats
[2:53:14] <CrematedCube> Taste don't matter much but it is easier
[2:53:17] <cosmicgoatee> never*

[2:53:58] <%chosenjuan42> I like boxed milk in Mexico

[2:54:12] <Darren716> Carton is the one true path
[2:54:13] <cosmicgoatee> remember collecting thosr
[2:54:18] <Daniel_Is_I> GET A JUG
[2:54:19] <%sparkly_yoyo> People who don't flip their bags smell bad and don't rotate their saves
[2:54:23] <%SeBigBoss> open the milk bag upside down
[2:54:24] <%Prevot> milk isn't expensive lol
[2:54:28] <CrematedCube> It's mostly a reaction of "BUT WHY THO"
[2:54:36] <%TubeMan642> Get jugs of milk guys
[2:54:39] <Daniel_Is_I> Plastic jugs are a thing.
[2:54:40] <ghoulishcripple> jug tech
[2:54:41] <Darren716> How do you fuck that up?
[2:54:41] <@akuda_bar> who uses paper cartons, even. you just get a jug
[2:54:42] <SixthSun2> Plastic jugs, though
[2:54:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh god we're back on Milk Bags.

[2:55:07] <CrematedCube> A need a freaking drink
[2:55:07] <SixthSun2> Milk Bags never go away, it's constantly lurking in the shadows ready to strike
[2:55:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> Why is Woolie shocked by the idea of plastic jugs for milk
[2:55:10] <whirly25> are bagged milks cereal sized
[2:55:10] <%ozzrabbit> Woolie, most milk in the us comes in plastic jugs.
[2:55:11] <Daniel_Is_I> US dairy is heavily subsidized so it's cheaper here
[2:55:13] <%sparkly_yoyo> I imagine Luigi patiently listening to this
[2:55:15] <Solidnick18> lmao
[2:55:17] <%TubeMan642> Milk comes in jugs
[2:55:17] <DeadMaannn> Best duo On twitch <3 <3
[2:55:19] <cosmicgoatee> bagged milk is cheap but like, how do you store it tbh
[2:55:25] <DeadMaannn> haha love guys
[2:55:27] <canadianogre> Americans are so dumb
[2:55:27] <%krispen_wa> I'm sorry his world involves bagged milk

[2:55:29] <+jiggy_snipe> milk purists Kappa
[2:55:37] <@akuda_bar> some people have never tried lumpy milk and it shows Kappa
[2:55:37] <ghoulishcripple> Bottles of milk is OG level
[2:55:38] <Skeletonmanners> woolie eat food any way you want but pls stop this topic is the worst
[2:55:38] <%TubeMan642> yes I am aware
[2:55:41] <gya0s> jugs still exist and are the best way
[2:55:41] <Darren716> Yeah in nice glass bottles
[2:55:43] <%elite867> LIES
[2:55:43] <%cobalt_phoenix_> why is no one mentioning glass bottles
[2:55:43] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:55:44] <Darren716> Not fucking bags
[2:55:44] <+Juriasu> that can't be true
[2:55:44] <gameNlounge> Milk Man AKA Step Dad
[2:55:45] <%chosenjuan42> Milk man breaks families
[2:55:45] <ghoulishcripple> bag milk is dollarstore
[2:55:45] <%sparkly_yoyo> Canada's not the only place with bagged milk guys
[2:55:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> Close mindedness, but refuses to open a banana from the BOTTOM
[2:55:46] <SixthSun2> Yes, and that's way better than bags
[2:55:47] <%SeBigBoss> Lets introduce more inferior ways to consume food and drink :)
[2:55:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait nvm
[2:55:48] <%SirGO0SE> did you know that milk bags are just plastic tiddies?
[2:55:48] <+pectusumbra> And we got rid of it because glass is heavy and sucks to transport
[2:55:50] <%ringabal> BUT IT WAS STILL A HARD CONTAINER
[2:55:51] <%dollarstored> the milk man was the primary suspect in adultery
[2:55:51] <abelincoln_catpuncher> yooo the milkman was lowkey the player back in the day @woolieversus
[2:55:52] <Solidnick18> but i wasn't around then so it doesn't exist
[2:55:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> Bottles better than BAGS
[2:55:56] <zeif00> No I am right, everyone else is wrong
[2:55:57] <+jiggy_snipe> drink straight from the cow Kappa
[2:55:58] <%cobalt_phoenix_> GLASS BOTTLES ARE THE BEST
[2:56:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> Bags were a downgrade from bottle.
[2:56:05] <damienlunas> Woolie using moral relativism to justify INFERIOR BANANA TECH
[2:56:05] <Daniel_Is_I> You need a jug for your milk bag anyway, just put it in the jug
[2:56:07] <cosmicgoatee> You'd leave the bottles outside for the milkman to collect as well
[2:56:07] <@akuda_bar> i drink my milk crunchy tbh
[2:56:12] <+DukeBlack_> Did you know that milk came from tits

[2:59:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> @bryxobryx Someone slipped in an Interspecies Reviewers mention into a sub message and Woolie couldn't hang.
[2:59:18] <%sparkly_yoyo> He got too HOT AND BOTHERED
[2:59:34] <ghoulishcripple> I'm glad woolie's weird apex controls are in the rotation. to remind us not to trust him
[2:59:47] <%chosenjuan42> he's just gonna drink some milk bags and be back
[2:59:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> Real talk, Interspecies Reviewers was a better anime than it had any right to be.
[2:59:51] <%sparkly_yoyo> I dunno man I play SM64 with a mouse
[3:00:06] <Meltgar> Woolie needs the flip flavour of the chips

[3:01:55] <ghoulishcripple> you know why Erik
[3:01:58] <%sparkly_yoyo> Milk bags are more satisfying
[3:02:07] <+phd_in_thuggery> I know this song as the OP to a really old Kingdom Hearts 2 OrgXIII flash series.......
[3:02:08] <ShinobiPhoenix> it's called Vortex Infinitum

[3:02:48] <gya0s> You have to get creative to kill someone with an empty milk bag.
[3:02:55] <ShinobiPhoenix> @phd_in_thuggery it's called Vortex Infinitum, it's Robo-Ky's song from the Korean version of Guilty Gear X2
[3:02:56] <%eriksdrums> Is this what Japan thinks sex is?!
[3:03:09] <Ner234> For those that don't realize: Woolie puts the song name in the bottom left.
[3:03:10] <zeif00> Have you been blessed by the fruit of knowledge?

[3:03:19] <%ringabal> @eriksdrums It's what they wish it could always be
[3:03:39] <ShinobiPhoenix> that is totally a Gamecube controller in Woolie's hand
[3:03:50] <%krispen_wa> He lives in 2017

[3:04:27] <dinnydanny777> Does it have Bugsnax?
[3:04:30] <mugglus> not true
[3:04:32] <%chosenjuan42> SUPER PAPER MARIO
[3:04:36] <+Rhinoprotoss> There's no stylish moves in Bug Fables
[3:04:39] <+blaze__drag> Bug Fables is the shit
[3:04:41] <%Prevot> nah bug fables writing is pretty good
[3:04:42] <damienlunas> that's fair
[3:04:46] <%bread_assassin> Woolie can't be bought.
[3:04:47] <%SirGO0SE> nothing but bangers
[3:04:48] <SixthSun2> Definitely go back to 64 sometime
[3:04:52] <+blaze__drag> and yeah I thought bug fable's writing was perfectly good
[3:04:53] <damienlunas> Very fair
[3:04:54] <%sparkly_yoyo> fuck everything play pokemon pinball
[3:04:55] <%chosenjuan42> SPM has amazing story but it's a platforming
[3:05:02] <+Keyblade97> dude bug fables would be a great watch
[3:05:07] <Darren716> Fuck Bugfables, SPM
[3:05:10] <ShinobiPhoenix> nah, Woolie could move on to another type of game, one Paper Mario for now is anotehr
[3:05:23] <ShinobiPhoenix> enough
[3:05:28] <%LuckyLagomorph> Publisher's bad but the devs are great

[3:05:58] <@akuda_bar> GamerDad
[3:05:58] <+blaze__drag> I will say Paper Mario is generally funnier tbf, but I still thought Bug Fable's plot was pretty good
[3:05:58] <%sparkly_yoyo> My dad only plays Mario Kart Double Dash
[3:06:01] <%sparkly_yoyo> Literally
[3:06:04] <CrematedCube> Took a break to prepare for Tales of Luigi
[3:06:14] <noe_juan_kanobe> @doomerskeletor13 Just back from break
[3:06:15] <cosmicgoatee> I love how bugsnax became a meme
[3:06:16] <zeif00> Vidya Dads are the best
[3:06:28] <Clear_Truth> @WoolieVersus Would you be willing to stream Einhander?
[3:06:31] <shamrocs> Didn't it say both?
[3:06:32] <%eriksdrums> I did not want to be remembered for this
[3:06:32] <dinnydanny777> Talkin' bout Bugsnax

[3:06:37] <dinnydanny777> Ooooowooooooooooo
[3:06:38] <%Williamld> How Arcane Kappa

[3:06:55] <+jiggy_snipe> and if you see a bunch of crazy nonsense back to back, stream is over
[3:06:58] <%ringabal> And then there's this fucklechuck
[3:07:04] <cosmicgoatee> oh boy weegi time
[3:07:22] <%kyh9> And the Four Heroes Lore
[3:07:24] <%Euphbugg> Weegi time
[3:07:31] <alphalejandro> Again, is time for another Luigi Jorge Joestar story time
[3:07:34] <%kyh9> TOO EXPERIMENTAL
[3:07:37] <%kyh9> TOO FANFICTION
[3:07:40] <Spinydoughnut33> game audio is very low
[3:07:54] <SixthSun2> Speaking of interesting side stuff, go check out the roof lore rat guy in east rogueport, he's definitely got new stuff now.
[3:07:54] <theCoolChild> Thanks for the HyperCrown @desertbear88
[3:08:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> MIyamoto hates story
[3:08:06] <Darthkitten_Prime> Origami king is doing a little better, but still far from the first three.
[3:08:12] <cosmicgoatee> interestingly enough Origami king has its merits, especially those of adventure
[3:08:18] <CrematedCube> He's aware of lore rat, he'll get there
[3:08:19] <%sparkly_yoyo> Mario can have new characters, but they can't be based on old ones
[3:08:28] <dizimous> Origami King doesn't have this kind of world building and not this kind of variety in desgins, but it's still very charming
[3:08:31] <%sparkly_yoyo> Meaning we can't have new toads or goombas
[3:08:42] <cosmicgoatee> but yeah the designs took a hit somewhat
[3:08:45] <+KityLinn> piantas
[3:08:53] <%Prevot> as recently as Odyssey they added new kinds of enemies
[3:09:00] <thesickestzak> PogChamp hydroxychloroquine PogChamp
[3:09:01] <fault_417> Baby pink gold Rosalina or some shit
[3:09:11] <%chosenjuan42> those cool day of the dead skull people in Odesssy
[3:09:19] <%sparkly_yoyo> Btw it's not a joke, the fact characters can't be personalized is actual company policy
[3:09:19] <%kulmoth> maybe when miyamoto croaks we can get some cool new paper mario
[3:09:23] <%kyh9> It's literally like a Kingdom-Hearts expansion of Mario Lore
[3:09:30] <gya0s> look at this marshmallow sperm motherfucker right here. You'll never see him again.
[3:09:31] <cosmicgoatee> I think my issue with Origami king is the sheer amount of Toads
[3:09:39] <Darthkitten_Prime> @dizimous Yeah, it has some really fun writing, a really pretty world, and the music is fantastic. It reminds me more of Luigi's Mansion, funnily enough.
[3:09:42] <%kyh9> There are interviews about this actually
[3:09:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> To be fair, there are absolutely elements that I would totally not put in what's meant to be a game kids are gonna play, like the fucking noose.
[3:09:45] <%Prevot> @kulmoth not if kensuke tanabe is still in charge
[3:09:47] <%sparkly_yoyo> They think it scares new players
[3:09:48] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1295605483974295559
[3:09:49] <+jiggy_snipe> maybe it's too much work
[3:09:49] <CrematedCube> When characters in one game get their own fanfiction in the next game
[3:10:01] <DatAsuna> Not people, just he bossman
[3:10:03] <SoratheWonderful> 🤔 true
[3:10:08] <%Proxzo> Origami King is actually pretty good
[3:10:13] <%chosenjuan42> I feel unfortunately never will get old style since new sold better.
[3:10:16] <%SirGO0SE> theyre employing the Little V strategy of "ask for it, we'll give the opposite :) "
[3:10:16] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> not as well but still great
[3:10:23] <%KaitlynnHere> i think it's because it was offbrand and nintendo doesn't like their IP's being fucked with, even within their company
[3:10:26] <DatAsuna> Corporate life = executives being their own data point
[3:10:36] <%Proxzo> They are sort of turning a corner with Origami King.
[3:10:41] <%KaitlynnHere> it sells so don't fuck with it
[3:10:41] <SixthSun2> A lot of people are putting Origami alongside 64 in how good it is, which is a compliment
[3:10:44] <CrematedCube> It feels like Discworld
[3:10:46] <Solidnick18> yeah
[3:10:50] <dizimous> I will say in the record the Origami king kind of fucks. Still sad that we don't get this kind if stuff still but I love it anyways
[3:11:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> Origami King from what I could see, was a decent step in a not terrible direction.
[3:11:04] <Darren716> I mean Sticker Star and OK out sold this one
[3:11:11] <DatAsuna> Having played origami, that's stockholm syndrome
[3:11:11] <%chosenjuan42> Sticker star sold well because we thought it would be old system. Oragami king sold well because of quarantine
[3:11:13] <%kyh9> I just sent you the interview
[3:11:18] <%nxflre> MArio movie is coming tho
[3:11:19] <%sparkly_yoyo> some people inside Nintendo are clearly trying to give the games some more personality, but they have to basically sneak it in
[3:11:23] <DatAsuna> people said colour s[;ash was just as good too
[3:11:24] <%Prevot> getting 10% of the charm of old paper mario games won't make me play Origami King if gameplay is still trash
[3:11:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Darren716 They were also not on a system many consider a failure.
[3:11:33] <DatAsuna> sticker star just battered them
[3:11:36] <%Proxzo> OK went in a better direction. I think it deserves it numbers outside of quarantine
[3:11:37] <Aeonknight_87> Luigi and NegaLuigi
[3:11:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> Digital downloading also bumped up numbers.
[3:11:45] <%SirGO0SE> and it is @Prevot :(
[3:11:46] <%glass_marcus> Origami king also sold well because it has a way better install base
[3:11:56] <DatAsuna> it's the chibi robo effect
[3:11:57] <%Euphbugg> ResidentSleeper
[3:12:05] <%ringabal> Is this Nier?
[3:12:05] <%ChoculaUltra> its funny because Nintendo is all about presenting something "fun" for everyone, except they hate fun no fun allowed
[3:12:10] <DatAsuna> star fox got the same treatment
[3:12:10] <%Proxzo> It's a good game. Just not a full RPG experiencce like TTYD.
[3:12:17] <cosmicgoatee> Luigi Automata?
[3:12:20] <%Prevot> the last 3 paper mario sales numbers are all because of the platforms they were on
[3:12:21] <%KaitlynnHere> ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[3:12:51] <%Proxzo> OK was good. I don't think that's fair to say about it. Not entirely due to install base.
[3:13:02] <%chosenjuan42> I just want a TTYD remake so it can be on something before besides GC
[3:13:04] <DatAsuna> Miyamoto would kill any star fox without a gimmick post gamecube too
[3:13:07] <fault_417> You want attachment percentage, not raw sales numbers apparently
[3:13:30] <cosmicgoatee> Luigiana Jones and the Last Crusade
[3:13:30] <%ChoculaUltra> Woolie is completely checked out LUL
[3:13:32] <%ringabal> Woolie actually on his phone
[3:13:35] <whiteblacklight74> Protheans?
[3:13:36] <sunnythedrunk> Fuck Nintendo's need for "innovation"
[3:13:43] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[3:13:43] <sunnythedrunk> actually fucking asinine
[3:13:45] <blitzmentalist> ResidentSleeper
[3:13:52] <damienlunas> Yo that's a good name.
[3:13:54] <%chiluzza> god this would be an amazing game as well
[3:13:58] <sunnythedrunk> Rip starfox and F-zero for not being gimmicky enough
[3:14:00] <DatAsuna> basically miyamoto/others re so gunshy after the gamecube they're sceptical that you can have conventional gameplay and succeed
[3:14:04] <+AbnormalVoid> oh god, its eyes are mouths
[3:14:05] <%sparkly_yoyo> just give me a Mario RPG, I don't care how, just an actual JRPG. Also that Rabbids game is actually pretty good
[3:14:15] <%ringabal> Hatesong sounds like a Rave Master tower

[3:14:34] <fault_417> Nintendo learned the wrong lesson from the success of the Wii
[3:14:40] <%PunkMcFox> "She's totally real, bro."
[3:14:43] <SixthSun2> Luigi's partner Screamy there is a recolor of the beta design for Smorgs.
[3:14:46] <%sparkly_yoyo> Godspeed Luigi, save the world so we can fuck it up by dying in our final battle

[3:15:26] <powerprotoman> screamy doesnt have eyes
[3:15:33] <powerprotoman> only mouths
[3:15:42] <%KaitlynnHere> @kyh9 NO
[3:15:44] <CrematedCube> I have no eyes and must scream
[3:15:46] <%ChoculaUltra> Screamy will be the one to turn out the lights and lock the door at the end of time.
[3:15:46] <SixthSun2> He's a recolored beta Smorg @WoolieVersus
[3:15:54] <gya0s> The Paper Mario Jolene AMV is the best thing, btw
[3:15:54] <+regis_j_rock> Screamy got some cool development history
[3:15:55] <prime_name> I'm pretty sure Screamy is a fetish
[3:15:57] <Solidnick18> lol

[3:17:02] <gya0s> @nicversus: Trouble quest
[3:17:08] <sunnythedrunk> I mean they added Lumas in galaxy and Cappys in Odyssey, their jsut very forgettable
[3:17:15] <+regis_j_rock> I'd say the 3D titles generally shake things up with characters and environments, but it's the rest of the franchise that's stagnant with the look.
[3:17:22] <+KityLinn> toksheLewd
[3:17:33] <+RadiantFalconGV> helo
[3:17:37] <%ChoculaUltra> I wouldn't mind a Bowser centric game with RPG elements tbh. Or even a management sim where you run the evil side of things.
[3:17:41] <gya0s> It's the one with Shawn Michaels in it.
[3:17:52] <Daniel_Is_I> Buff, sweaty men, woolie
[3:17:53] <%Papa_Bearman> This is what we call A DIRT SHEET, BROTHER!!!

[3:17:55] <Darren716> Shes reading the dirt sheets
[3:17:55] <%Prevot> porn
[3:17:56] <fault_417> Piantas has a level of individuality that Lumas and Cappys really lack
[3:17:57] <%nxflre> looking at buff men
[3:18:01] <%ringabal> SHE'S STEALING AEW IDEAS
[3:18:02] <CrematedCube> Return the Bara

[3:18:12] <%kyh9> She's headhunting
[3:18:12] <%i_heart_gaming> is she looking at the sweaty half dressed men?
[3:18:13] <gya0s> Why is she borrowing it from.... Toodles?
[3:18:16] <cosmicgoatee> hmmm muscly bodies
[3:18:19] <%Papa_Bearman> Observe this!! This is what we call A DIRT SHEET, BROTHER!!

[3:18:28] <%i_heart_gaming> I READ IT FOR THE TRENDS
[3:18:29] <%JeoDood> lewds
[3:18:30] <%eriksdrums> Look. It's not weird to have a Walmart magazine. But 13 year old me got REAL defensive when mom fgound it in my room
[3:18:32] <SixthSun2> I think the joke is that she's actually checking out wrestlers
[3:18:34] <alphalejandro> could be a WCW one, you don't know
[3:18:35] <%Prevot> it's full on bara porn
[3:18:35] <+jiggy_snipe> and why would Toodles have it? Kappa
[3:18:38] <Blunder_Blue> @gya0s Tootles was in Chapter 3 first as a Rwk Hawk fan.
[3:18:38] <%i_heart_gaming> SHE WAS READING IT FOR THE ARTICLES
[3:18:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> Why is Vince McMahon watching AEW!?
[3:18:44] <CrematedCube> Bara = guys blasting chest
[3:18:45] <Darren716> Because she needs to see what got leaked out to the dirt sheets
[3:18:53] <+Juriasu> SNOOF
[3:18:55] <Solidnick18> ahhhh
[3:18:57] <%sparkly_yoyo> gobbs
[3:18:58] <gya0s> Woolie has a sickness for the quickness
[3:19:01] <spardanwarrior> Would you say that she reads it for the articles?
[3:19:09] <theCoolChild> Only one SNOOF?
[3:19:09] <%ringabal> "I'm sorry" says Woolie, his eyes hollowed out.
[3:19:17] <%Papa_Bearman> Did you know that King K VS. Rawk Hawk was the first ***** match in Glitz Pit history?
[3:19:23] <Solidnick18> LUL
[3:19:24] <jetboots> Woolie snoofs a snoof
[3:19:27] <%ChoculaUltra> these damn secrets man monkaS
[3:19:29] <+Juriasu> it is surely clear Kappa
[3:19:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie is sounding like a drug addict apologizing for falling off the wagon again.
[3:19:33] <Solidnick18> but what if
[3:19:43] <%chosenjuan42> Glitzville Schrodinger's star piece
[3:19:55] <%ringabal> PFFFFT
[3:19:56] <+RadiantFalconGV> is that Gravity Suit Mario
[3:20:03] <gya0s> That's only because Grubba never booked Craw-Daddy for more than a 10-minuter, and you know that.
[3:20:14] <%chosenjuan42> hype
[3:20:16] <SixthSun2> @RadiantFalconGV It's WAAAA-vity Suit Mario
[3:20:19] <CrematedCube> I think they'll set off bombombs
[3:20:24] <Daniel_Is_I> They can burn I think
[3:20:32] <SoratheWonderful> Yet!
[3:20:38] <cosmicgoatee> @solidnick18 I were to disguise them as my own Snoofing? Ho ho, delightfully devilish, Mario
[3:20:47] <+RadiantFalconGV> I miss playing this game
[3:21:06] <+RadiantFalconGV> I miss Paper Mario. shame the series ended after the Wii title
[3:21:09] <Daniel_Is_I> It makes mario dodge
[3:21:12] <%chosenjuan42> just mario
[3:21:13] <CrematedCube> It's a small cloud around Mario
[3:21:16] <+regis_j_rock> That's not what the attack does Woolie
[3:21:18] <%chosenjuan42> Mario Ultra instinct
[3:21:22] <+TheRisingPride> It just gives Mario the "Dodgy" status
[3:21:24] <BlueFusionVolt> They do burn damage to you or the enemies if pointed at your direction
[3:21:31] <+regis_j_rock> It's a Repel Cape but as an attack
[3:21:42] <Solidnick18> a little snoof here and their yes very good

[3:22:03] <%kyh9> So she's a celebrity gossip hound
[3:22:11] <ShiningAxis> sounds like Jolene just wants to be popular

[3:23:27] <+regis_j_rock> Did Koops get a +2 from the Upgrade?
[3:23:31] <+jiggy_snipe> she probably pinches Mario's cheeks
[3:23:31] <%nicversus> Woolie does a halfway decent Marge Simpson
[3:23:32] <CrematedCube> She's so horny on main
[3:23:44] <+regis_j_rock> Or am I just misrembering his partner badges.

[3:25:07] <%AFrostyCookie> no other problems at all
[3:25:08] <shiny_prinny> you just described a lot of this game
[3:25:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> EVEEEE
[3:25:10] <CrematedCube> It's because some quests overlap
[3:25:16] <+TheRisingPride> It's probably to prevent certain flags from triggering off each other
[3:25:16] <Solidnick18> back to glitzville
[3:25:20] <xiccy> Old game is old

[3:25:28] <%sparkly_yoyo> 2004
[3:25:29] <%chosenjuan42> I hope if they remake this game (doubt it) they let you stack troubles
[3:25:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie would die playing Animal Crossing.
[3:25:47] <SixthSun2> Now it's time for the start of REAL backtrack hell
[3:25:53] <shiny_prinny> old game and a Nintendo game at that
[3:25:54] <%CommanderSqueaks> Animal Crossing is intentionally designed to limit efficiency as much as possible.
[3:26:00] <%Th3SmartAlec> @chosenjuan42 Last person to ask that was shot by Miyamoto
[3:26:07] <%Papa_Bearman> You could only do one quest at a time in 'Phantasy Star Online', even the GameCube versions.
[3:26:08] <%AFrostyCookie> Eve is better off
[3:26:09] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> yes
[3:26:09] <Solidnick18> LUL
[3:26:10] <Robot_Nixon_> who?
[3:26:11] <+Juriasu> Eve is better off
[3:26:12] <%Prevot> in 2004 subtitles weren't even a common thing yet
[3:26:17] <%nicversus> God could you imagine if this game had quest markers like in Skyrim?
[3:26:19] <gya0s> I'm genuinely curious if they nope out of this quest once they hear it.

[3:38:54] <+MechArch> stomp the dick!
[3:38:57] <CrematedCube> If you want to get rid of some dried bouquets in storage, I learned the best use for them
[3:39:23] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> across

[3:39:31] <SixthSun2> First level, middle
[3:39:47] <%chosenjuan42> go up and left
[3:39:50] <An_Armed_Bear> I always remember getting lost in the underground
[3:39:50] <gya0s> dried bouquets are as useful now as they'll ever be.
[3:39:53] <%ringabal> Woolie took the RE2 route
[3:39:54] <CrematedCube> dried bouquet + anything HP or FP
[3:40:05] <CrematedCube> even a dried shroom will work
[3:40:25] <%sparkly_yoyo> wonky would tell you >:(
[3:40:28] <%sparkly_yoyo> ... probably
[3:40:28] <SixthSun2> Combine them with stuff like dried shrooms and mistakes to make a pretty good item @WoolieVersus
[3:40:44] <%chosenjuan42> most recipies are SECRET
[3:40:54] <%Papa_Bearman> Wait, you lost 50 coins on that?!

[3:41:41] <cosmicgoatee> certainly is a...mystery
[3:41:50] <Sol_Install> yes
[3:41:51] <%sparkly_yoyo> You can cook a mystery with other item to make a random item (50%failure chance)
[3:41:54] <%psidefx> its a trip to the meadows that shell
[3:41:55] <Zohare> The mystery could be anything tho
[3:41:55] <%Euphbugg> yup :)

[3:42:06] <%Rosen_Thorne> Shell’s useless anyway with Koops’s ability
[3:42:09] <%Papa_Bearman> You're losing 50 coins for every Gold Bar x3 you buy.
[3:42:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> This is why Reggie lost Dokapon
[3:42:21] <+pectusumbra> also looked up what the bouquets are for. combine them with any healing item to get a unique food item
[3:42:24] <%nxflre> @zoopbooploop they shaming us for always recommending

[3:49:51] <StarMechV> Dooplis's star
[3:49:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> CORTEZ
[3:50:06] <%kyh9> The monsters' appetites
[3:50:07] <%nxflre> THe monster's appetite
[3:50:08] <shiny_prinny> the monsters' appetites
[3:50:12] <Blunder_Blue> No, Woolz, the monster's appetites
[3:50:13] <spardanwarrior> The appetites of the MONSTERS not the PUNIES
[3:50:13] <Daniel_Is_I> THE MONSTERS APPETITES
[3:50:14] <%krispen_wa> The MONSTER's appetites
[3:50:15] <%kyh9> No, it's the monsters' appetites
[3:50:15] <+DukeBlack_> oh god
[3:50:16] <%kulmoth> the monsters appetite
[3:50:17] <Darren716> Woolie...
[3:50:19] <%ringabal> THE MONSTERS APPETITE
[3:50:20] <+Rhinoprotoss> Woolie so good at reading
[3:50:22] <%kyh9> THE MONSTER'S APPETITES
[3:50:22] <spardanwarrior> Punies were the food
[3:50:22] <SixthSun2> the MONSTER"S appetites
[3:50:24] <%KyoryUtchy> The fierce appetites OF THE MONSTERS
[3:50:24] <%doomerskeletor13> Reading comprehension
[3:50:25] <Daniel_Is_I> Illiteracy
[3:50:25] <noe_juan_kanobe> No lore about Twilight?
[3:50:26] <%LastHazzerd> The Monsters were the things with the apetites
[3:50:28] <+DeRedBaron> re-reading it it means they were prey
[3:50:28] <Aeonknight_87> it's worded funny enough to be interpreted either way
[3:50:29] <%Proxzo> "their" probably refer to the monsters
[3:50:30] <zoopbooploop> ...
[3:50:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> Monsters were hungry
[3:50:36] <%Prevot> punies are food
[3:50:39] <StarMechV> "their" means the monsters after the punis
[3:50:40] <shiny_prinny> "their" refers to the monsters
[3:50:51] <CrematedCube> Discursive analysis is hard sometimes
[3:50:54] <+jiggy_snipe> their = the monsters
[3:50:54] <+zooeymainbtw> ye
[3:50:54] <%kyh9> It's not 100% clear, to be fair
[3:50:57] <%nxflre> very careful yeah
[3:50:57] <%Prevot> jesus woolie not this again
[3:50:57] <Drusain> the lore for twlight is that the boo heroine was the chest in the town
[3:50:59] <+jiggy_snipe> that's not clear tbf
[3:50:59] <Nomad94> Ambiguous syntax
[3:51:00] <+zooeymainbtw> very true reggie
[3:51:04] <shiny_prinny> true
[3:51:06] <%kyh9> PUNIES HUNGER
[3:51:09] <+zooeymainbtw> though i prefer the dark lore
[3:51:09] <%Proxzo> yeah, localization
[3:51:11] <%kyh9> I like your versions first
[3:51:11] <%sparkly_yoyo> Woolie Ghouling the Punies
[3:51:12] <Sol_Install> yea
[3:51:12] <%LastHazzerd> language is hard!
[3:51:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> The writing is ambiguous.
[3:51:14] <%nxflre> yeah pretty fair
[3:51:15] <+TheRisingPride> Oh, this is one of those "Lets eat grandma" situations
[3:51:16] <+jiggy_snipe> that's why you don't use a pronoun there
[3:51:16] <%Prevot> it's that potion making shit all over again
[3:51:16] <%Euphbugg> fair
[3:51:16] <%kyh9> I like Woolie's version more
[3:51:17] <Nomad94> Japanese would not have this problem
[3:51:18] <StarMechV> HOW DOES ONE ENGLISH
[3:51:21] <+DeRedBaron> yeah like at first i was like "oh..." but then rereading it i was like OH yeah that was a little tricky cus you can forget it
[3:51:22] <Darren716> Idk this was pretty easy with context clues
[3:51:25] <SoratheWonderful> Grammar lessons~
[3:51:29] <+zooeymainbtw> you good woolie
[3:51:31] <%LastHazzerd> doesn't help that the monsters were on the previous page
[3:51:32] <CrematedCube> I'm constantly minding my use of 'it' to avoid confusion
[3:51:51] <mugglus> "pronouns suck"-Elon Musk
[3:52:11] <%sparkly_yoyo> what a dick
[3:52:16] <Drusain> yes
[3:52:19] <cosmicgoatee> my pronouns are monstar/monstars
[3:52:19] <%ringabal> He was nice
[3:52:19] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:52:19] <%Papa_Bearman> That sounds like a fucking nightmare.
[3:52:20] <SoratheWonderful> Koopa boat
[3:52:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> Remember Cortez didn't give a FUCK about the star. He just gave it to you.
[3:52:34] <shiny_prinny> if Cortez was a little more observant, he could have been a major villain
[3:52:53] <+DukeBlack_> eat it
[3:52:55] <Nomad94> make it a Champion belt, perhaps?
[3:52:58] <%Proxzo> They didnt know they were cursed
[3:53:00] <noe_juan_kanobe> How does thing guy know all this stuff?
[3:53:01] <%BisoromiBear> prison pocket
[3:53:04] <@akuda_bar> part of the trap is they didn't know
[3:53:06] <%Proxzo> but this guy knew?
[3:53:08] <%Prevot> wait what
[3:53:12] <%Prevot> they knew?
[3:53:14] <@akuda_bar> Or that. who knows
[3:53:18] <%kyh9> the painting yoooo
[3:53:25] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> they didnt know
[3:53:30] <%psidefx> Don't ask how they know
[3:53:32] <SoratheWonderful> Jumpman Toad
[3:53:36] <%kyh9> Poshley's dad
[3:53:39] <StarMechV> THE MOOOON
[3:53:40] <CrematedCube> Maybe he heard about what happened to the others
[3:53:41] <@akuda_bar> If you don't know... Now you know
[3:53:46] <%Euphbugg> That could be the one that the X-nauts have as well
[3:53:53] <Blunder_Blue> So there might be one or two more stories but they got the big reveal and that's all that matters.
[3:53:55] <Daniel_Is_I> Like an onion, as was the style at the time
[3:53:56] <noe_juan_kanobe> Toad was the last one.
[3:54:00] <+zooeymainbtw> great lore
[3:54:01] <SixthSun2> Grubba had the best idea
[3:54:02] <+DeRedBaron> remember the one on the moon wasn't there originally, it was in rouge port cus the x-nauts got it before the start of the game
[3:54:04] <sunnythedrunk> That would be a pretty good idea bruuuther
[3:54:14] <Drusain> Who would've thought the chests had lore
[3:54:19] <%Papa_Bearman> Love how it's dark in Woolie and Reggie's room.
[3:54:24] <%Papa_Bearman> Can't see 'em.
[3:54:27] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> chapters
[3:54:28] <%chosenjuan42> L O R E
[3:54:34] <sunnythedrunk> The Lore is pretty nice
[3:54:35] <SixthSun2> Getting all the chests definitely unlocked the lore related to them @WoolieVersus
[3:54:36] <%SirGO0SE> GG

[0:03:22] <%strugglepunk2> strugglepunk2 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! Unlucky thirteen in time for tablelords. not a sign, right? yeaaaaaahhhhh. In more serious talk, appreciate the years of content, Wools. Keep it up and have fun.
[0:03:23] <+Dorf1> yeah unfortunatley if woolie decided to do an rpg stream theyd fuck up by picking some modern permutation of D&D like pathfinder or 5e
[0:03:24] <mrfreezepunsbestpuns> I'd love a Go stream
[0:03:26] <+DreyfussFrost> There are some legit great board games these days. They've been having a renaissance for the last decade or so.
[0:03:30] <foreverN2dust> @Calek snowsosFastaf
[0:03:33] <fist_wizard_jay> LET THE BOARDGAME THUGGERY BEGIIIN
[0:03:38] <%CappuccinoGuil> Nah, play Swordsfall. Afropunk TTRPG
[0:03:38] <SolSwagGuy56> 5e is fine
[0:03:49] <+Pookiedaexzile> 5e is fine
[0:03:50] <SolSwagGuy56> Especially for beginners
[0:03:52] <+spaghetti_shaman> Imagine if Woolie is playing Catan today
[0:03:59] <sparkly_yoyo> There must be a lot of resources for stream friendly games
[0:04:01] <+ggbhtg> @pookiedaexzile booooi
[0:04:01] <foreverN2dust> 5e is great
[0:04:02] <Thirtine> havent been able to make the afternoon streams, but stoked to catch the return of Table Lords <3
[0:04:07] <vadnhi> Unless Woolie is possessed by the ghost of an ancient historical Go mastersometime during play, I think i'd pass on that... :P
[0:04:13] <+emperordread> I didn't know woolie played board games
[0:04:18] <ArtooKilledYou> I’ma imagine it’s gotta do with either robots or fight world
[0:04:18] <spawnzie> I feel like Lancer is right up Woolie's alley
[0:04:20] <southstarshen> Thanks for the HahaSweat @salty_syd913
[0:04:22] <+ghostattack_1998> Funny enough my D&D game starts at 9 some I'm watching this while I wait lol

[0:04:32] <SolSwagGuy56> I didn't know Woolie playeed Video Games Kappa
[0:04:33] <SomersaultJustice> it's wolly time
[0:04:33] <+spaghetti_shaman> Anyone played the Fallout board game? If so is it any good?
[0:04:35] <simifu> welp time to watch a 30 sec bear commercial LUL
[0:04:37] <sparkly_yoyo> @emperordread he had this big ass campaign of Kingdom Death Monster that ended in abject failure
[0:04:39] <+ggbhtg> Is Tabletop Simulator good for streams for real?
[0:04:43] <+DreyfussFrost> God if it was a Twilight Imperium stream I'd shit my pants right now, but that will never happen.
[0:04:44] <%salty_syd913> @southstarshen ye
[0:04:47] <%Consloe32> Consloe32 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:04:51] <+Pookiedaexzile> It is adequate 5e will get you there
[0:04:54] <sparkly_yoyo> @CappuccinoGuil can he beat Mario though?
[0:04:56] <+emperordread> @sparkly_yoyo lol excellent
[0:04:57] <+Pookiedaexzile> it will wet your whistle
[0:05:03] <+Pookiedaexzile> It will do a fine job
[0:05:06] <+DreyfussFrost> @ggbhtg Yeah, even has a spectator mode for it where the streamer can play without revealing their hands.
[0:05:08] <+Pookiedaexzile> at beingokay
[0:05:14] <+bootysteve> Any word on what he's gonna be playing?
[0:05:14] <%Consloe32> Yeyeyeye it's tablelords time!
[0:05:14] <Calek> Mansions of Madness would be a fun stream
[0:05:24] <SolSwagGuy56> How is Woolie? I hea4rd all this streaming stuff's been stressing him out
[0:05:25] <foreverN2dust> Reposting my predictions for clout when I guess one: Lancer, Secret Hitler, or a deckbuilding game.
[0:05:26] <vadnhi> @Calek Yooooo~!
[0:05:40] <+Dorf1> 5e isnt a bad system but it literaly has no strong points other than having a chokehold on the market.
[0:05:41] <spawnzie> I'm guessing Secret Hitler
[0:05:42] <Solidnick18> HahaCat

[0:06:19] <fist_wizard_jay> Yo if its Secret Hitler this is gonna be good
[0:06:25] <foreverN2dust> I want to brew a mixed game between Secret Hitler and Secret Santa now.
[0:06:26] <+Pookiedaexzile> @Dorf1 As I said 5e is fine
[0:06:26] <vadnhi> I like Pathfinder a lot batter than 5th Ed. but I confess that %th is a *lot* better system to introduce raw newbies to, due to its simplicity.
[0:06:28] <%CappuccinoGuil> Chat... why do I hear boss music?
[0:06:33] <SolSwagGuy56> God I hope Jolyne's beatdown theme is hype
[0:06:40] <+bootysteve> God I hope part six gets animated
[0:06:40] <+Pookiedaexzile> KillBoss as Entered

[0:06:45] <ArtooKilledYou> A fight is comin
[0:06:47] <sparkly_yoyo> Some Xenos are ok... I'm gonna get BLAMMED for that one won't I?

[0:07:26] <%mayorrev> SourPls
[0:07:26] <+Dorf1> the idea that 5th is good for beginers is crazy when the game is intentionally designed to scare new players away from trying other games.
[0:07:30] <%CappuccinoGuil> FUCK
[0:07:31] <SolSwagGuy56> @CappuccinoGuil HELL YES
[0:07:31] <sparkly_yoyo> @vadhni aww shit here we go again D:

[0:08:39] <StarkMaximum> man that woolie inkling is extremely cute
[0:08:40] <+Pookiedaexzile> 5e is simple, but I've seen Grave Clerics Flavored so many different ways I think its the purpose
[0:08:46] <+bootysteve> hellpockets help, hellpockets help, hellpockets help, we golden wind!
[0:09:05] <+Declan_8000> I can actually catch a stream for once
[0:09:15] <+Dorf1> wizards keeps a chokehold on the market by giving new players the impresion that every rpg is a player facing monstrosity that takes more than an evening to grok
[0:09:17] <+Declan_8000> something is going to go wrong right?
[0:09:24] <Major_monotone> Oh man every single piece of art is so strong

[0:09:54] <$theKittenhugs> SICK
[0:09:56] <vadnhi> I'll confess, if they do something fantasy-themed, it would be neat to see Woolie try to go cleric... Buddying up to a God that *ACTUALLY* does provable and rather hype sh*t for your benefit. :P

[0:37:42] <+invisi_bliss> woolie and the mic is peaking
[0:37:42] <shotgang86> its poping so much that this will be marked as a real mexican standoff
[0:37:43] <Kazic5000> Cronchy bois

[0:37:48] <+kjsandwich> It seems woolie has held a gun before

[0:37:58] <Cory_the_Dinosaur> let it crunch
[0:38:00] <Amardeux> no make it go upppp
[0:38:02] <Solidnick18> mic peaks are good
[0:38:05] <%strugglepunk2> !PACE AT RISK!
[0:38:07] <gsoto83> They need a nice calm game like Tokido, a game thats about traveling from edo to kyoto. They cant yell at that
[0:38:07] <BearSawed> Peaking sounds like auditory shotgun to my brain
[0:38:08] <Major_monotone> Audio tempura
[0:38:09] <+CaliJester> Just kill the mic. Subtles only
[0:38:10] <%KENTASHIRO> the problem with turning it down is Minh becomes VERY hard to hear
[0:38:10] <%doughvatkyn> now that woolies fixing it i already want it back at high peak
[0:38:13] <vadnhi> Someone show queue up that mix of Whales ("Money, Motherf**ker") mixed with Temmie's theme, just in case... ;)

[0:39:38] <rubbishbinge> Minh and steph are fine, Reggie and Woolie peak sometimes
[0:39:41] <+DreyfussFrost> I think Woolie forgot about stream delay. They can turn it down and we can turn it up on our end.
[0:39:43] <SummonerMagno> marriage at risk
[0:39:47] <Renny_Nanaya> woolie starting to peak again now that he's leaning back into the table
[0:39:47] <Solidnick18> Kiss those boots
[0:39:47] <sparkly_yoyo> Big crimes for big boys
[0:39:50] <$theKittenhugs> alleged marriage
[0:39:51] <Rellim80> Desync?
[0:39:55] <Graxe_> The mic's closer to Woolie and Reggie, though
[0:39:57] <Major_monotone> Domestic violence: the game
[0:40:06] <Graxe_> So it's gonna peak out for them more often
[0:40:07] <+CaliJester> Just be ready everyone. You know everyone here. It's going to get rough but have a good time and make do.
[0:40:08] <+QueequegTheater> @Rellim80 I'm not seeing/hearing any
[0:40:13] <$SilverRoddo> ⭕️ Reggie will remember that.
[0:40:27] <sparkly_yoyo> @CaliJester "we'll fix it in post"
[0:40:31] <Rellim80> Then just me. Thnx
[0:40:33] <vadnhi> Woolie's special ability is that, even if he's fatally shot, he gets to vomit in PunchMom's purse before he's fully eliminated. :D
[0:40:56] <%CappuccinoGuil> Yeah, medkit on the 1st round is BAD oof
[0:40:59] <+Pookiedaexzile> This game works better with a blindfold
[0:41:03] <gsoto83> Well they still can't take cash if they get shot, its not exactly free
[0:41:08] <+CaliJester> @sparkly_yoyo First time stuff is always rough. Wollie will figure out what to do next time
[0:41:20] <%CappuccinoGuil> Any of the support cards in the first round is bad luck lol
[0:41:27] <gsoto83> all board games are like that
[0:41:27] <Major_monotone> Woolie will figure it out
[0:41:31] <+QueequegTheater> @Rellim80 Try F5 maybe
[0:41:42] <Cory_the_Dinosaur> card counting with guns
[0:41:53] <BinaryShuffle> clip PunOko
[0:41:57] <+Pookiedaexzile> Woolie is literally yrying to frame data this
[0:41:58] <gsoto83> The best they can do is figure out what they want and watch a quick "rules explained" before hand
[0:42:02] <jonnyc613> what game is this?
[0:42:07] <Major_monotone> If you think about it, clip counting really is advanced card counting
[0:42:08] <vadnhi> 'Magazine'
[0:42:15] <gsoto83> @jonnyc613 Cash n' guns
[0:42:18] <ghostravens> @jonnyc613 cash n guns second edition
[0:42:28] <%CappuccinoGuil> I think it'd be neat if they each learned a board game and taught to each other
[0:42:32] <+CaliJester> Now put your card in your gun

[0:42:56] <Cory_the_Dinosaur> magazines are for legos and videogamea
[0:42:57] <vadnhi> The natural urge is to point it at the person right across from you.
[0:42:58] <+Pookiedaexzile> Magazines are what you read when youtake a shit, Clips are what goes in guns
[0:42:58] <sonofthedeepsouth> honor minh

[3:14:12] <+CaliJester> DUMB!? MONEKY!?!?
[3:14:17] <%Th3SmartAlec> But Hercules is OP by nature
[3:14:22] <vadnhi> We would need a *REALLY* big stake to kill that Monkey... :/
[3:14:34] <%RioGascar> so
[3:14:36] <%RioGascar> A tree?
[3:14:37] <nobody12349> Roman, Heracles is Greek
[3:14:45] <%Th3SmartAlec> Hydra's a BITCH

[3:14:53] <+TheNameless2000> Yo that's relatable Minh
[3:15:08] <Kazic5000> King kong has speed, size, and a launcher. His zoning is too strong
[3:15:10] <%Th3SmartAlec> Define a 'stake'
[3:15:27] <vadnhi> Imagine if you gave Potemkin a Piranah-launcher...
[3:15:34] <@Menitta> I think given the circumstances, a lightsaber can take the place of a stake
[3:15:39] <%mh9s> man killed a minotaur yeah
[3:15:42] <%RioGascar> can it?
[3:15:42] <neet98> Kong gonna lose vs Godzilla in 2020 anw

[3:16:11] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Clearly Sorbo
[3:16:12] <%SilvaChariot0133> >Kong Zoning
[3:16:14] <%SilvaChariot0133> LUL
[3:16:18] <Kazic5000> Woolie speaks truth.
[3:16:23] <agadejobi> Those fish aren't going to do shit to Hercules
[3:16:31] <@Menitta> Now King Kong has the piranha launcher. Are the piranhas the same size as King Kong
[3:16:31] <%Th3SmartAlec> ASSUMPTIONS

[3:16:54] <nobody12349> Heracles couldn't even save his kids, Kong wins
[3:16:57] <vadnhi> The Piranah just remove the prtective bubble wrap, Then K.K. is free to step on him.
[3:17:01] <neet98> it just shadow of the colossus
[3:17:11] <@Menitta> If its above water, piranhas dont fuckin matter

[3:24:28] <yuribo26> Clearly talking about musicians Kappa
[3:24:29] <blue6sub6remnant6> There's a modern hip-hop context for Trapper?
[3:24:40] <%RioGascar> Trap music
[3:24:47] <yuribo26> @blue6sub6remnant6 its a sub genre of rap
[3:25:02] <%RioGascar> I thought it was edm
[3:25:03] <Graxe_> That's a Stand power
[3:25:09] <+Vigonept> inside out means no eye shot
[3:25:12] <cumurasame> Trapper wins for sureeee

[3:27:31] <%mh9s> she's a GREAT trap
[3:27:32] <Graxe_> What traps are we talking about here?
[3:27:32] <NeroInfinite> He's a chaterine wheel of fire power
[3:27:34] <cumurasame> but Goliath can't use the eyes in close range because he'd burn himelf too
[3:27:38] <QuestionableDes> Goliath isnt smart
[3:27:40] <rubbishbinge> A trapper know their environment
[3:27:43] <%Th3SmartAlec> r we in the wilderness?
[3:27:51] <Prevot> goliath is a huge guy with all range weapons, no way she can get close
[3:27:55] <%mh9s> you lost to a teenager goliath!
[3:27:55] <zafooru> IEDs are traps
[3:27:59] <gade177> d n d?
[3:28:01] <Graxe_> How big is the biblical Goliath?
[3:28:02] <blue6sub6remnant6> It's a nephilim.
[3:28:06] <Halospaz117> The most dangerous game
[3:28:06] <NeroInfinite> Super fight
[3:28:07] <%yasukanzuki> monkaS
[3:28:09] <QuestionableDes> She could ambush Goliath
[3:28:10] <cassiecagedd> big
[3:28:14] <%RioGascar> goliath lost against a rock
[3:28:16] <Reizie_Etherealm> The greatest hunt of all, MAN
[3:28:18] <NeroInfinite> Ambush a giant
[3:28:22] <+saladin1911> Goliath is a renowned military warrior tho
[3:28:24] <nobody12349> C-Moon wins
[3:28:31] <%SilvaChariot0133> Goliath is a Jpbber LUL
[3:28:34] <%SilvaChariot0133> *Jobber
[3:28:38] <+griffball13> its true
[3:28:59] <%mh9s> trappers dont know about rocks says reggie
[3:29:03] <agadejobi> Wiat a minute
[3:29:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> "so he's a bitch"
[3:29:03] <zafooru> Is Baz the son of Goliath??
[3:29:04] <+griffball13> he is the baz of the bible
[3:29:11] <agadejobi> Wasnt that rock blessed by god?
[3:29:12] <rubbishbinge> Achilles skull
[3:29:13] <@Menitta> yes
[3:29:14] <nobody12349> Rock in a dome would put a lot of people down
[3:29:21] <vadnhi> You know, if David had lost, then the moral of the story would have been "Don't take on a 9-foot-tall trained warrior with no armor and just a silly sling."
[3:29:22] <Graxe_> Lasers move faster than cannons
[3:29:23] <agadejobi> A speicific rock that God told David to pick up?
[3:29:33] <%RioGascar> I think it just shoots forward
[3:29:39] <%mh9s> PEW PEW
[3:29:40] <zafooru> laser = light
[3:29:50] <NeroInfinite> LAsers is light boys

[3:30:09] <Kazic5000> Rave out the ear!
[3:30:09] <%Th3SmartAlec> PogChamp
[3:30:13] <milhousego> Goliath is canonically "6 cubits and a span" which is about 9 foot 9 inches.
[3:30:14] <+griffball13> how would he reload the cannons?
[3:30:18] <zafooru> those canons aren't hitscan
[3:30:19] <+Dorf1> woolie those are the same thing
[3:30:22] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> You can't parry a cannonball.
[3:30:28] <cumurasame> cannons reload time also is required
[3:30:29] <%RioGascar> how BIG ARE THE CANNONS
[3:30:33] <Kazic5000> It's also a goliath sized cannon
[3:30:37] <%RioGascar> ^
[3:30:44] <%RioGascar> TRAPPER LOSES
[3:30:46] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Cannons are not slow.
[3:30:48] <Kazic5000> Parkour that you casual
[3:30:48] <+CaliJester> Okay all. I'm taking off. Enjoy the rest of the stream everyone
[3:30:50] <%RioGascar> massive MASSIVE shot
[3:30:52] <Reizie_Etherealm> If lasers shoot out straight from both ears then just spin around in place and have 360 degree laser coverage
[3:30:56] <blue6sub6remnant6> @Engwithan_Elder_God You've never played Akatsuki Blitzkamp, have you?
[3:31:02] <Bludhaven_Knight> Shoulda picked Keith David Goliath.
[3:31:08] <jase__x> He should have said goliath from Shadow of the Collossus
[3:31:16] <$SilverRoddo> Mega Man defeated Gamma, one kick. Spoilers.
[3:31:21] <+DreyfussFrost> Cannons aren't SLOW, wtf are you talking about Woolie? Slow to reload maybe, but they would DESTROY anything you could parkour on.
[3:31:21] <%mh9s> trapper aint even gonna let goliath see em coming
[3:31:23] <+invisi_bliss> rub it in
[3:31:26] <vadnhi> See, Kieth David Goliath would just fly. WHAT'S THEE TRAPPER GONNA DO?
[3:31:41] <Graxe_> Cannons look slow like how airplanes look slow
[3:31:47] <Graxe_> But are actually super fast
[3:32:02] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> @blue6sub6remnant6 Nope, just talking real cannons and guys who lost legs thinking they could stop rolling cannon balls back in the Civil War.

[3:34:17] <@Menitta> Starlord can already fly
[3:34:18] <Kazic5000> How will trapper hit him? Star lord could throw loot crate junk at trapper.
[3:34:19] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> I am.
[3:34:21] <$SilverRoddo> Loot boxes is the Santa Bag from Ernest Save Christmas.
[3:34:21] <Halospaz117> SHE CAN'T TOUCH HIM IN THE AIR

[3:35:01] <crimsonsaens> It wasn't as good as 1, but it was still pretty good
[3:35:03] <cumurasame> HE CAN BE PACMAN
[3:35:03] <vadnhi> He couldn't do that alone, Woolie. That was the point.
[3:35:22] <nobody12349> No Woolie, that got cut off when he killed Ego. He's mortal.
[3:35:25] <zepelinnn1> woolie picking the boss character
[3:35:27] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Not the most powerful. Close to the most powerful.

[3:35:54] <blue6sub6remnant6> Didn't Peter Quill give up those powers when the movie ended?
[3:35:56] <+saladin1911> Starlord can fly and has guns. Parkour is dead.
[3:35:56] <TalisKanju> What board game is this?
[3:35:57] <Graxe_> He lost all of his powers because he killed Eho.

[3:36:11] <eyezehuhh> who would've thought Woolie would lie in front of his fiance
[3:36:20] <crimsonsaens> Crazy Talk really has infected Woolie
[3:36:23] <Kazic5000> Do the characters keep their standard weaponry along with black cards?
[3:36:25] <%QaizerArt> Those are Eternals you friggin goof
[3:36:26] <%SilvaChariot0133> But he has nerfed flight here
[3:36:28] <TalisKanju> Looks like Superfight
[3:36:29] <+DreyfussFrost> And Celestials aren't gods, they're the most powerful mortals in the universe. They're on a cosmic scale, but not literal gods.
[3:36:31] <magboost> IS woolie Explaing Exhalted?
[3:36:36] <Reizie_Etherealm> What is this Gundam 00 Celestial Being crap?
[3:36:49] <nobody12349> Woolie, Quill lost his powers
[3:36:52] <$SilverRoddo> woolieWHENS ye!ye!ye!
[3:37:01] <Prevot> I dont know about the celestial shit, but he can fly and has guns so he's already won
[3:37:02] <Halospaz117> She can't touch him if he's in the air tho
[3:37:04] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie: "ah she got me on my bullshit"
[3:37:09] <Graxe_> But half Celestials aren't guaranteed to get those powers.
[3:37:11] <%RioGascar> Woolie looking at chat, we know you lying
[3:37:12] <crimsonsaens> Celestials are just a tier higher than mortals, there are higher tiers
[3:37:12] <cumurasame> He only has his creation powers near his dad, so it's quite debateable otherwise. Otherwise he just had better... magical resistance?
[3:37:17] <vadnhi> And he needed the rest of the team in order to safely manage holding an Infinity stone, at that.
[3:37:18] <Graxe_> Remember how many kids Ego had?
[3:37:20] <+DreyfussFrost> The Eternals are the gods. Woolie is straight-up lying about Star Lord's abilities.
[3:37:22] <blue6sub6remnant6> But why didn't he use those powers in Infinity War Woolie?
[3:37:23] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie is talking out of his ass
[3:37:26] <@Menitta> Starlord can already fly with those boosters tho
[3:37:26] <+invisi_bliss> laughable at best
[3:37:33] <@Menitta> he dont need that extra slow flying
[3:37:42] <%Th3SmartAlec> Molasses even
[3:37:47] <masterfire23> makes lootcrates filled with Pac man
[3:37:48] <nobody12349> Call him
[3:37:55] <zenith0111> LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[3:37:56] <%RioGascar> meni i think even if he can fly
[3:38:00] <%RioGascar> He just flys slow now
[3:38:06] <nobody12349> Nah, he can't Woolie
[3:38:08] <seylumiue> So its a debuff
[3:38:10] <Graxe_> He never pulled it out because he lost it when he killed Ego.
[3:38:11] <vadnhi> Just vomit in her purse. Woolie. That'll put her in her place...
[3:38:13] <NickHatesSnow> he lost the power
[3:38:17] <@Menitta> No its an extra power
[3:38:21] <Kazic5000> @vadnhi LUL
[3:38:24] <@Menitta> It wouldnt break his boosters
[3:38:25] <cumurasame> he can't use them in Endgame, because he can only use his powers when his dad is alive
[3:38:25] <magboost> Woolie the power died with EGo
[3:38:43] <Graxe_> Booster flight is fine, but Star Lords Celestial power is gone.
[3:38:44] <%Th3SmartAlec> WOOLIE
[3:38:52] <vadnhi> Black Bolt can't scream in Space. Ego takes it. :P
[3:38:55] <%RioGascar> Minh he lying
[3:38:55] <cassiecagedd> has nobody looked at chat
[3:39:00] <crimsonsaens> Or if you're just popular
[3:39:01] <nobody12349> Woolie the liar, stop stealing my pies
[3:39:02] <SetsuRyuu> Woolie the Liar strikes again
[3:39:03] <+DreyfussFrost> Star Lord's ACTUAL celestial powers are basically limited to energy projection and matter manipulation. Basically telekinesis and energy beams (that come FROM Ego, who is DEAD in the MCU).
[3:39:05] <@Menitta> Lmao comics
[3:39:10] <masterfire23> look at woolie bullshiting his way
[3:39:11] <jase__x> Lying his ass off
[3:39:24] <Reizie_Etherealm> Woolie the liar stole my pie
[3:39:31] <Halospaz117> SHE CAN'T TOUCH HIM IN THE AIR
[3:39:34] <blue6sub6remnant6> Why didn't he save Gamorah woolie?
[3:39:35] <$LiquidShake83> sbfpYeyeye apatBig lies
[3:39:38] <@Menitta> Yes BUT
[3:39:42] <$SilverRoddo> So, we still yet to see Quill go ultra-instinct.
[3:39:43] <%RioGascar> BUT HE FLIES SLOW
[3:39:46] <Graxe_> Didn't they nuke Ego's brain?
[3:39:48] <@Menitta> The trapper, an expert parkourist
[3:39:49] <SetsuRyuu> only punchmon can see through his lies. She must've been lied to so many times. You tell him girl
[3:39:51] <%RioGascar> He cant get in the air
[3:39:53] <%Th3SmartAlec> AND THEN HE LOST IT
[3:39:53] <Graxe_> And that's how they beat him?
[3:39:54] <@Menitta> Can probably wall run and double jumo
[3:39:57] <magboost> Why didn't Quin use it against Thanos
[3:39:57] <@Menitta> jump*
[3:39:57] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1207129758447939586?s=19
[3:39:58] <@Menitta> So
[3:39:59] <nobody12349> He lost the powers when he beat his dad
[3:39:59] <+DreyfussFrost> He didn't beat his dad, Rocket did! WITH A BOMB.
[3:40:04] <Halospaz117> Ok so don't fly by walls then
[3:40:12] <%RioGascar> Woolie you so lying
[3:40:13] <crimsonsaens> @blue6sub6remnant6 "love is just chemicals in his celestial brain"
[3:40:17] <%Th3SmartAlec> The Trapper takes it
[3:40:19] <magboost> His dad had his brain blown out
[3:40:20] <@Menitta> Hey he's SLOW AS FUCK
[3:40:21] <vadnhi> Plus, the trapper can just taunt Star-LOrd till he makes a mistake.
[3:40:27] <magboost> Big ass target
[3:40:28] <Graxe_> Yeah, Woolie's leaving out facts.
[3:40:31] <cumurasame> yes you could DEBATE the timeline but tbf Starlord has his spaceship/jetpack/elemental gun...
[3:40:32] <%Th3SmartAlec> ARE WE IN SPACE WOOLIE
[3:40:33] <magboost> yes the helmet
[3:40:36] <seylumiue> Why are we in space now
[3:40:37] <rubbishbinge> Parkour is more impressive than moving astral bodies
[3:40:41] <@Menitta> There's no environment card
[3:40:44] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie making shit up

[3:40:46] <blue6sub6remnant6> @crimsonsaens MercyWing1 LUL MercyWing2

[3:40:59] <zenith0111> 2
[3:40:59] <+DreyfussFrost> Woolie is just straight up making up shit.
[3:41:02] <%QaizerArt> the fact that woolie is super forgetting there's a difference between celestials and eternals
[3:41:03] <Graxe_> He's not that powerful
[3:41:03] <NeroInfinite> Woolie the Liar strikes again!
[3:41:03] <zenith0111> Starlord
[3:41:03] <@Menitta> Woolie is cherrypicking to win. I respect it.
[3:41:10] <seylumiue> Play to WIN
[3:41:10] <Graxe_> Trapper wins
[3:41:12] <%Th3SmartAlec> Because you're stacking the deck
[3:41:14] <vadnhi> Now if it was BATMAN, then I could believe that he could survive in space. ;)
[3:41:15] <%wydamn> half this game is making up shit to be fair
[3:41:16] <%RioGascar> woolie you lying i cant respect it
[3:41:20] <nobody12349> Lie to WIN
[3:41:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> Loot crate is random
[3:41:25] <magboost> Man this is some batman teir Lyinng
[3:41:25] <+invisi_bliss> that's not how loot crates work
[3:41:32] <rubbishbinge> Loot crate only has a 1% of SSR
[3:41:35] <zenith0111> 1 or 2S
[3:41:38] <%QaizerArt> celestials ain't -SHIT- compared to Eternals
[3:41:40] <Kazic5000> Loot crates are full of nerd junk
[3:41:42] <SetsuRyuu> press mad lies for Ws
[3:41:43] <@Menitta> ALRIGHT CHAT

[3:51:08] <Kazic5000> Very intelligent animals
[3:51:12] <zenith0111> Ooooooooh shit
[3:51:12] <Prevot> velociraptors are very clever girls
[3:51:20] <neet98> Minh just need to say the word FATE
[3:51:20] <+Vigonept> they can open doors
[3:51:20] <%SilvaChariot0133> One trapper vs ALL of the Raptors
[3:51:22] <rubbishbinge> Win by sheer numbers
[3:51:27] <Prevot> they beat the trapper guy in jurassic park
[3:51:27] <Halospaz117> Yeah but they raptors can swarm
[3:51:35] <$LiquidShake83> jurrassic park
[3:51:35] <%Th3SmartAlec> Yes, but do Trappers deal with more than one animal at a time
[3:51:36] <+R0bobot> HOW DO YOU KNOW HOW TO TRAP RAPTORS? In specific?
[3:51:36] <neet98> DO IT MINH
[3:51:41] <vadnhi> They can open doors. They can certainly swim.
[3:51:47] <Reizie_Etherealm> Negating the raptors is one thing but you still can't defeat underwater king arthur even if you do
[3:51:52] <@Menitta> Nah this trapper is like a living tower defense game
[3:51:55] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> Cold bloodied raptors are slowed by the cold water
[3:52:07] <%RioGascar> Minh walking his rude back
[3:52:08] <Prevot> the raptors literally trapped the trapper in jurasic park
[3:52:09] <$LiquidShake83> raptors cant swim
[3:52:12] <zenith0111> woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM
[3:52:12] <vadnhi> Yeah. But it's like, several hours with that suit.

[3:53:21] <Halospaz117> Oh this Trapper is just OP now
[3:53:23] <bear_breaker20> wait wait wait wait wait wait .... .... ... ... I thought King arthur was a B-cup?!?
[3:53:25] <Kazic5000> Minh wreaked a top tier contestant with a bad arguement
[3:53:25] <cumurasame> Does King Arthur has his magic sheathe that makes him invulnerable. BTW what is the name of this card game?
[3:53:36] <%QaizerArt> @DXLelouch24 nah that's fuckin bullshit easy to do, you need to be fair a bit
[3:53:37] <archaicbro> He's blessed by the faeries tho
[3:53:46] <%RioGascar> that ability is kinda bullshit
[3:53:49] <vadnhi> Yeah, but then you have a Raptor-sized chunk of gold with sharp edges hurtling at you... :/
[3:53:53] <zenith0111> woolieMIRIN_RD woolieMIRIN_RD woolieMIRIN_RD woolieMIRIN_RD woolieMIRIN_RD woolieMIRIN_RD
[3:53:54] <%RioGascar> He has to TOUCH
[3:53:55] <%QaizerArt> @cumurasame Super Fight
[3:53:56] <Prevot> he would still take damagd tho
[3:54:07] <%Th3SmartAlec> but he would still take Pierce damage
[3:54:07] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:54:08] <Halospaz117> They'd still get hits in tho
[3:54:09] <rubbishbinge> Momentum doesn’t stop
[3:54:09] <+S1LENTxHERO> What is the context of this argument?
[3:54:11] <+R0bobot> Turning inside out doesn't kill instantly, I think the bite would still pierce.
[3:54:16] <%SilvaChariot0133> Touch vs BEING touched?
[3:54:18] <Halospaz117> The bites would add up
[3:54:19] <Graxe_> Turning inside out doesn't stop the momentum, though
[3:54:20] <archaicbro> Oh yeah, Excaliburs sheathe is toyally OP
[3:54:22] <+Vigonept> does inside out proc before puncture?
[3:54:24] <+biggysweet> start with inside out raptors ez
[3:54:24] <%QaizerArt> I've played it, this is a fucking BANGER of a game
[3:54:29] <zenith0111> woolieMIRIN_RD woolieMIRIN_RD woolieMIRIN_RD woolieMIRIN_RD woolieMIRIN_RD woolieMIRIN_RD woolieMIRIN_RD
[3:54:31] <%RioGascar> okay turning teeth inside out
[3:54:34] <%RioGascar> Still teeth
[3:54:38] <yficaptions> having contact does not equal doing the touching
[3:54:40] <vadnhi> Then you have whirling pieces of bone as they turn inside out. That's like a buzzsaw...
[3:54:40] <%RioGascar> So STILL BITING
[3:54:43] <Reizie_Etherealm> @biggysweet LUL
[3:54:44] <magboost> @bear_breaker20 weak king arther is a B-Cup True king Arthor is a E Cup
[3:54:46] <%QaizerArt> Depends all on your debate ability
[3:54:46] <Graxe_> If the raptor bites fast and hard enough, it can still snap bone
[3:54:52] <zenith0111> woolieMIRIN_RD woolieMIRIN_RD woolieMIRIN_RD woolieMIRIN_RD woolieMIRIN_RD
[3:54:57] <Prevot> minh had the advantage but his strategy was garbage
[3:55:12] <powerprotoman> they still do damage tho
[3:55:13] <vadnhi> The trapper's power is as much curse as it is blessing... :(
[3:55:13] <neet98> minh needed to say one word
[3:55:14] <QuestionableDes> Minh is not using anime logic
[3:55:15] <%QaizerArt> @Prevot you right
[3:55:22] <Graxe_> Bullets will get inverted, too, but the sheer velocity of the bullet will kill the trapper
[3:55:23] <archaicbro> @magboost Ah I see you prefer Lancer Altria
[3:55:24] <+Vigonept> nerf
[3:55:24] <bear_breaker20> @magboost HahaThink (like you could be more right)
[3:55:25] <+kahryez> how fast is the turn inside out power?
[3:55:27] <%RioGascar> What if King Arthur just waits out trapper age wise
[3:55:28] <bruno_silv0> all mihn had to do is mention fate arthur and it would be over
[3:55:28] <%Th3SmartAlec> this interpretation of the Trapper ability is OP
[3:55:32] <zenith0111> woolieMIRIN_RD woolieMIRIN_RD woolieMIRIN_RD woolieMIRIN_RD woolieMIRIN_RD
[3:55:33] <Reizie_Etherealm> If Minh fought with a sword then there would've been a chance
[3:55:34] <Bludhaven_Knight> All the traps would turn inside out.
[3:55:34] <+biggysweet> This is stand battle the game
[3:55:47] <%SilvaChariot0133> if the tooth/claw turns inside out INSIDE of you, wouldn't that end up being WORSE for the trapper?
[3:55:59] <Prevot> all minh neededto do was swing his fucking sword
[3:56:03] <Graxe_> The power is "turns anything inside out on touch"
[3:56:05] <%QaizerArt> @Th3SmartAlec Dude the Trapper's ability is broke as hell.
[3:56:13] <Graxe_> That includes inanimate objects
[3:56:14] <+kahryez> so the trapper is naked right?
[3:56:15] <%QaizerArt> What Graxe said
[3:56:24] <zenith0111> woolieMIRIN_RD woolieMIRIN_RD woolieMIRIN_RD
[3:56:32] <+kahryez> nothing can touch them?
[3:56:35] <Graxe_> But it doesn't slow things down
[3:56:36] <rubbishbinge> The inside of claws is still keratin
[3:56:38] <%Th3SmartAlec> okay, but what is King Arthur pulls a. Jolyne
[3:56:38] <%RioGascar> its still METAL
[3:56:47] <Graxe_> If something moves fast enough, it will hurt and potentially kill
[3:56:50] <+Vigonept> laser beams
[3:56:50] <+kahryez> the ground is turning inside out as he is walking around?
[3:56:56] <vadnhi> Ask the Lady of the Lake, Woolie.
[3:56:56] <zenith0111> woolieMIRIN_RD woolieMIRIN_RD woolieMIRIN_RD woolieMIRIN_RD woolieMIRIN_RD woolieMIRIN_RD
[3:56:59] <QuestionableDes> Excalibur is a magic sword though
[3:57:04] <Graxe_> Regardless of being inverted
[3:57:11] <Josef_Stryker> woolieGASM
[3:57:13] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> 😡
[3:57:15] <+griffball13> angry american kirby
[3:57:18] <vadnhi> Also, didn't Excalibur's sheath protect from all harm? :/
[3:57:18] <Reizie_Etherealm> There's a wall next to the water??
[3:57:19] <%QaizerArt> So basically Arthur and Trapper kill each other?
[3:57:20] <fist_wizard_jay> KIRBY IS FUCKING PISSED
[3:57:21] <@Menitta> wooliePOYO
[3:57:24] <archaicbro> Wait cN the trapperability be zombie rule'd? Heal kills?
[3:57:30] <%Th3SmartAlec> I like how the chats vote has know been ignored
[3:57:42] <%QaizerArt> Also does woolie just have a bunch of kirbies in his pocket
[3:57:44] <Halospaz117> But what would turning the suit inside out do
[3:57:48] <longsilver97> the most scuffed stream
[3:57:51] <Graxe_> You can just shoot them
[3:57:59] <Graxe_> Bullets get inverted, doesn't stop their speed
[3:58:00] <@Menitta> Chat is the 3rd vote
[3:58:01] <Prevot> our opinion only matters as a tie break
[3:58:01] <jase__x> the trapper is using full gold everything even clothes man this is bad
[3:58:21] <zenith0111> What if you half to fight a monster that's already inside out?
[3:58:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> I thought Woolie said we were a 5th vote, but I guess I misheard
[3:58:31] <archaicbro> This is a loss via lack of English lore Hahahaha
[3:58:51] <+biggysweet> Mihn should have used raptors requiem
[3:58:58] <Reizie_Etherealm> That tag you're dead ability is pretty OP
[3:59:08] <Kazic5000> By the logic of that power, if the trapper touched the Earth, it would turn inside out.
[3:59:19] <@Menitta> thatd be sick
[3:59:24] <@Menitta> inside out planet

[4:01:46] <Graxe_> Do-over
[4:01:49] <zenith0111> Botched
[4:01:53] <Reizie_Etherealm> Heart when applied to a robot would be the core then
[4:02:20] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[4:02:38] <Reizie_Etherealm> But cold can't even wield the lightsabers or the gun
[4:02:43] <%RioGascar> Microscopic disease with lightsaber tho
[4:02:45] <%QaizerArt> Man, I knew Reggie pulled something strong, but Iron Giant is a robot.
[4:02:47] <%yasukanzuki> minh and his timers LUL
[4:02:48] <vadnhi> Basically, Neo Geo saw Capcom's more sucessful Superfighters and made their own knock-off ones... :P
[4:02:55] <%RioGascar> midoclorians getting REVENGE
[4:02:58] <%Th3SmartAlec> killed by the cold
[4:03:02] <@Menitta> The germ bacteria are holding very small lightsabers
[4:03:06] <zenith0111> Yes but it makes humans get sick ;)
[4:03:14] <ohgodscorpions> if it could hold the sabers they would be microscopic
[4:03:17] <%Th3SmartAlec> it's REALLY POWERFUL
[4:03:25] <NeroInfinite> Wasn't there a Kid's next door villian called the common cold?
[4:03:27] <vadnhi> The bacteria get inside your lungs and lightsaber you to death from the inside! :o
[4:03:34] <magboost> Tiny lightsabers chainsaw throught the Iron Giant
[4:03:36] <%Th3SmartAlec> especially against LIVING THINGS
[4:03:42] <Halospaz117> The common cold doesn't have arms...
[4:03:42] <zenith0111> Microscopic lightsabers or normal lightsaber? LUL
[4:03:42] <%Gamefriendly> wait sorry Reggie it wasnt you, I think it was punchmom
[4:03:49] <@Menitta> that acid aint gonna hurt iron
[4:03:57] <vadnhi> Lots of microscopic lightsabers.
[4:04:00] <rubbishbinge> Common cold doesn’t actually move though
[4:04:04] <Kazic5000> Iron giant flies to space to kill all cold on him.
[4:04:07] <vadnhi> it's like a grey-goo scenario.
[4:04:07] <%RioGascar> Would acid burn through?
[4:04:08] <@Menitta> Its like Pokemon. It doesn't affect steel.
[4:04:08] <+aversal_ammar> It doesn’t move
[4:04:08] <rubbishbinge> transfer via other conduits
[4:04:11] <FLAWDREW> woooo!
[4:04:12] <%SilvaChariot0133> the fork melts obviously Kappa
[4:04:12] <+Dorf1> by that logic you could just say any character is omnipotent and wins instantly
[4:04:29] <zenith0111> If the common cold doesn't move how does it spread chat? Kappa
[4:04:52] <+biggysweet> The cold kills the fish
[4:04:55] <rubbishbinge> Droplets mainly
[4:04:57] <vadnhi> It's sapient enough to engage in a tournament for honor and glory.
[4:05:11] <%Th3SmartAlec> I like how we're treating the common cold like a super virus
[4:05:18] <+robro_> next round hahaah
[4:05:21] <@Menitta> Hey man it sucks getting a cold
[4:05:26] <Reizie_Etherealm> Take the L
[4:05:29] <zenith0111> L
[4:05:31] <Kazic5000> Blow out
[4:05:32] <magboost> Has woolie never seen Green Lanturn A cold can totally hold a weapon
[4:05:33] <%Th3SmartAlec> L
[4:05:39] <vadnhi> C'mon. If the cold can't take actions, then you might as well just remove it as a card entirely. it's like putting a rock in as a competitor...
[4:05:44] <Kazic5000> No chance. Bad draw.
[4:05:51] <seylumiue> Its one sided
[4:05:53] <zenith0111> Booooo
[4:05:57] <+aversal_ammar> One sided as fuck
[4:06:04] <%Th3SmartAlec> acid
[4:06:07] <%SilvaChariot0133> Sterilize?
[4:06:10] <zenith0111> True
[4:06:13] <Kazic5000> No win scenario.
[4:06:18] <%Th3SmartAlec> IRON GIANT HAS NUKE LASERS
[4:06:18] <+biggysweet> Iron Giant is immune to the cold.
[4:06:19] <+Vigonept> DRAE

[4:06:23] <zenith0111> Draw?
[4:06:26] <powerprotoman> DRAW
[4:06:33] <Rangenade> the commen cold will outlive the iron giant
[4:06:42] <%RioGascar> common cold is not able to survive outside
[4:06:51] <Kazic5000> The game has rules. Cold doesn't gain new abilities
[4:06:53] <%RioGascar> it dies by heat and...ironically cold
[4:06:56] <%Th3SmartAlec> that's extrapolating
[4:06:58] <+robro_> iron giant can only die from a steak to the heart according to the cards haha
[4:07:01] <Soulbishop> Can it operate like the fungus plague from last of us
[4:07:01] <%Gamefriendly> Hey mods, what's the rule regarding posting clips of the stream?
[4:07:11] <zenith0111> woolieMIRIN_RD
[4:07:14] <+biggysweet> If we go by those rules we can change the cold to the G virus.
[4:07:27] <%RioGascar> Common cold cant make it airborne for long
[4:07:36] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[4:07:39] <+invisi_bliss> oh dayum
[4:07:48] <neet98> G VIRUS

[4:07:50] <animalxer> You can't just cauterize the flu woolie
[4:07:57] <rubbishbinge> Common cold.
[4:08:02] <rubbishbinge> is rhinovirus
[4:08:02] <Reizie_Etherealm> Let's move on to the next match
[4:08:03] <vadnhi> It's a akiju-sized bacteria.
[4:08:08] <vadnhi> *kaiju
[4:08:13] <SetsuRyuu> its own card shouldnt defeat itself. Its armed with it, it means it can use it
[4:08:13] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:08:26] <%wydamn> The common cold has midichlorians

[4:08:59] <rubbishbinge> This is also true
[4:09:05] <%Th3SmartAlec> that said, match is over, let's move on
[4:09:09] <powerprotoman> The rule of super fight is never agree with the enemy
[4:09:09] <zenith0111> BASED MINH
[4:09:10] <+biggysweet> One of the symptoms of the common cold is sudden lightsaber growth.
[4:09:10] <alphonseisbest> this is fucking great!!!! /pog
[4:09:20] <bruno_silv0> how does something without physical form hold anything
[4:09:21] <%wydamn> wait, midichlorians are the evolved form of the common cold
[4:09:26] <seylumiue> Minhs energy is limitless
[4:09:31] <+invisi_bliss> arrogance is a powerful weapon

[4:10:17] <Reizie_Etherealm> That was a rock paper scissor match up if I've ever seen one
[4:10:20] <+robro_> trapper cures the common cold
[4:10:23] <%Th3SmartAlec> Purple Haze Feedback is just a cold PogChamp

[4:11:16] <magboost> Minh Wins
[4:11:17] <zepelinnn1> you cant beat that man
[4:11:19] <QuestionableDes> Kaiju can survive letting the nuke go
[4:11:20] <+CarlosEoM> we got a real match PogChamp
[4:11:22] <NeroInfinite> That's a fun choice and also how they killed the iron giant in the first place
[4:11:24] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> nuke counter
[4:11:28] <%Th3SmartAlec> IRON GIANT does canonically ly survive a Nuke
[4:11:31] <neet98> Minh win
[4:11:31] <%QaizerArt> yeah minh just wins
[4:11:32] <%RioGascar> PACFIC RIM TIME
[4:11:32] <QuestionableDes> Iron Giant cant survive a nuke
[4:11:34] <%wydamn> The kaiju could probably survive the nuclear impact, too
[4:11:35] <hntronium> Not necessarily a pacific rim monster tho
[4:11:35] <+robro_> its a draw
[4:11:37] <+robro_> llol
[4:11:40] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Halospaz117

[4:11:57] <%RioGascar> ...minh wins
[4:11:58] <magboost> S teir
[4:11:59] <NeroInfinite> The unbetable wall vs the un stoppable wall.
[4:11:59] <cassiecagedd> for FUN
[4:12:01] <fist_wizard_jay> The fuck is this game it sounds awesome
[4:12:02] <+Shady_Zaku> Superfight?
[4:12:04] <rubbishbinge> Iron giant goes into battle mode because of the missile
[4:12:04] <%mayorrev> FOR GLORY
[4:12:06] <+griffball13> some kaiju are imune to radiation
[4:12:08] <NiktenKing> LUL
[4:12:13] <nobody12349> 3
[4:12:14] <%Wonderbot3000> but cant the iron giant put himself back together
[4:12:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> Kaiju wins by regeneration after the Nuke goes off. IRON GIANT gets blown apart
[4:12:15] <neet98> Kaiju have some real loser though
[4:12:24] <%mayorrev> Its just Pacific Rim
[4:12:34] <%SilvaChariot0133> BOTH parties can just regenerate LUL
[4:12:34] <+Shady_Zaku> IRON GIANT HAS REGEN
[4:12:35] <zenith0111> @wonderbot3000 But kaiju can stop down the pieces after the explosion
[4:12:40] <seylumiue> @fist_wizard_jay called Super Fight
[4:12:42] <DedlokPM> But then it dies
[4:12:42] <archaicbro> NGL playing a game while watching this and I keep missing beats cause the current match sounds too cool haha
[4:12:49] <+SuperiorDelta> Yikes, Woolie knows how Iron Giant vs. Nuke goes down
[4:12:51] <%Th3SmartAlec> and it SURVIVES
[4:12:53] <BlacSoul> I STAY
[4:12:57] <%wydamn> oh fuck he's right
[4:12:57] <vadnhi> Remember, even if the Iron Giant survived a nuking, he was still blown to pieces for a bit. It depends on who reassembes first.
[4:12:59] <+griffball13> and the iron giant survives
[4:13:01] <CalderGaming> not exactly, it superman flies into the missile
[4:13:04] <%RioGascar> “Victory”
[4:13:05] <BlacSoul> YOU GO Kappa
[4:13:10] <%RioGascar> Not sure about that
[4:13:11] <zenith0111> FUCK IT IS A DRAW
[4:13:16] <nobody12349> IG put himself back together afterwards
[4:13:22] <+Polter_ge1st> The nuclear energy would fuel the Kaiju and will lead to a new transformation
[4:13:22] <%RioGascar> A W???
[4:13:23] <%Th3SmartAlec> ...did Woolie forget he survives
[4:13:24] <powerprotoman> woolie he loses this fight
[4:13:24] <%SilvaChariot0133> This comes down to who can Timer-Scam better
[4:13:24] <nobody12349> Itsa draw
[4:13:24] <Reizie_Etherealm> Ok the only thing we need to discuss is can the Kaiju survive the nuke cause we all know the Iron Giant doesn't
[4:13:25] <+Dorf1> also the nuke isnt a stake to the heart so he can just tank it
[4:13:29] <+Vigonept> say he has regen or else nah
[4:13:31] <+Shady_Zaku> Iron Giant Has REGEN HE LIVED
[4:13:31] <+Estuko> FeelsBadMan He is Super Man
[4:13:32] <magboost> Yeah but the Regen took a while
[4:13:34] <%Gamefriendly> this argument is the biggest stretch rn lul
[4:13:34] <+Shady_Zaku> apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong
[4:13:36] <zepelinnn1> woolie is trying man, i respect that
[4:13:39] <vadnhi> Yeah. but the Kaiju can essentially do the same thing, since he regenerates.
[4:13:40] <powerprotoman> its his lose condition woolie
[4:13:49] <Prevot> kaiju piccolo
[4:14:01] <%SilvaChariot0133> !xtier
[4:14:03] <nobody12349> @Reizie_Etherealm He did, it's a later scene and he puts himself back together
[4:14:09] <+biggysweet> So the nuke is now gone. We have a monster that grows forever vs. Iron Giant that needs to die by stake to the "Heart."
[4:14:09] <zenith0111> So it comes down to who can complete annihilate the other one
[4:14:12] <hntronium> This is a bit of a stretch
[4:14:14] <%Th3SmartAlec> KARS
[4:14:16] <zenith0111> Like pieces and all
[4:14:17] <Halospaz117> Where can I watch this movie?
[4:14:21] <QuestionableDes> The Mental Gymnatics on this... Come on Woolie
[4:14:22] <rubbishbinge> Iron Giant puts itself back together as well
[4:14:22] <+griffball13> the iron giant lives
[4:14:23] <%RioGascar> does regen occur IF THERES NOTHING TO REGEN
[4:14:23] <BlacSoul> "I Lived BITCH" -Iron Giant
[4:14:27] <%FrostedZaibatsu> I hated the Iron Giant. Still remember that WHOLE day marathon riooTea
[4:14:29] <nobody12349> They both live
[4:14:32] <%RioGascar> Nuke deletes atoms
[4:14:33] <%mayorrev> BIRKIN
[4:14:34] <Graxe_> Iron Giant can't die unless a stake through the heart, though
[4:14:34] <powerprotoman> dead pool exists woolie
[4:14:34] <vadnhi> Does the nuke count as a 'stake'? :P
[4:14:37] <%RioGascar> So would kaiju win?
[4:14:44] <nobody12349> draw
[4:14:44] <%mayorrev> Birkin only died to a nuke
[4:14:47] <%Th3SmartAlec> I love Woolie forgot about Iron Giant aurvives
[4:14:48] <Graxe_> But kaiju constantly regenerates
[4:14:49] <+Polter_ge1st> Kaiju wins
[4:14:51] <+dmtjinni> Minh almost showing booty smh
[4:14:51] <%SilvaChariot0133> Pre-detonated nuke probably = stake yeah
[4:14:55] <zenith0111> Iron Giant survived an atmoic bomb but if it was a modern nuke he'd be gone
[4:14:55] <+biggysweet> "I'm super man."
[4:14:55] <Prevot> wait is woolie arguing for a draw
[4:14:58] <+Shady_Zaku> He doesnt ride it he flies INTO it superman style
[4:15:07] <%Th3SmartAlec> @zenith0111 fair
[4:15:10] <Halospaz117> Did woolie forget the giant lived?
[4:15:18] <+Shady_Zaku> suuuuperrmaaan.
[4:15:19] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:15:19] <+itsOnyxLeo> DAMN
[4:15:20] <nobody12349> No wait acid totally slows down regeneration
[4:15:23] <worldbrand> oh fuck
[4:15:27] <%Th3SmartAlec> MINH IS RIGHT
[4:15:27] <%SilvaChariot0133> Minh Wins this
[4:15:28] <NeroInfinite> DAMN he got it in one
[4:15:30] <zenith0111> @nobody12349 Oooooo
[4:15:30] <+itsOnyxLeo> Minh going hard
[4:15:31] <vadnhi> Sorry. it's a kryptonite nuke, Supes.
[4:15:33] <nobody12349> Acid is a good coward
[4:15:37] <%Th3SmartAlec> OH MAN
[4:15:38] <Prevot> finally minh with a good argument
[4:15:39] <nobody12349> Counter
[4:15:40] <+Polter_ge1st> MIHN IS CORRECT
[4:15:45] <%FrostedZaibatsu> Regenaration requires something to grow from. Youre obliterated by a nuke
[4:15:46] <Reizie_Etherealm> The robot's heart/core will be disintegrated with the explosion for sure
[4:15:48] <+Polter_ge1st> Cross Counter
[4:15:49] <%Th3SmartAlec> ...and he lost me
[4:15:50] <hntronium> All he does is Minh Minh Minh no matter what
[4:15:54] <BlacSoul> yeah but its not a stake tho...
[4:16:01] <%SilvaChariot0133> Metal Stake Kappa
[4:16:01] <+Shady_Zaku> last time I checked Metallo was POWERED by Kyrptonite apatSmug
[4:16:02] <zafooru> riding that missile is pretty much a guaranteed alpha strike
[4:16:07] <magboost> Nuke gives the Kaiju infinate power
[4:16:08] <+Polter_ge1st> Shot through the heart, and you're too late
[4:16:10] <%FrostedZaibatsu> A nuke through the heart. DAMN hggLul
[4:16:12] <%Gamefriendly> I feel like Minh kinda made it worse for himself
[4:16:13] <nobody12349> IG doesn't die in the end
[4:16:15] <vadnhi> If a lightsaber can count as a 'stake' then so can a nuke.
[4:16:18] <+Polter_ge1st> you give love, a bad name
[4:16:18] <+Shady_Zaku> IRON GIANT REGENA
[4:16:18] <+Dorf1> @Reizie_Etherealm in the movie it literaly doesnt harm any individual part of it
[4:16:23] <%Th3SmartAlec> Minh just destroyed his own argument by bringing up the stake
[4:16:24] <BlacSoul> so does IG
[4:16:28] <+Shady_Zaku> You forgot the damn movie
[4:16:30] <Fetty_Krill> What are they playing?
[4:16:32] <seylumiue> Can the nuke pierce the iron giant anyway
[4:16:34] <BlacSoul> STAKE
[4:16:37] <ohgodscorpions> the point of the stake killing is that it stays in the nuke blows up so it doesn't stay in
[4:16:44] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie. he doesn't die
[4:16:49] <QuestionableDes> Kamehameha =/= Nukes
[4:16:49] <+biggysweet> Iron Giant can only die by a stake so if the monster has no stake he is fucked.
[4:16:51] <powerprotoman> woolie kaiju gain power from nuclear energy!
[4:16:52] <rubbishbinge> Missiles are pretty much exploding stakes
[4:16:57] <+cvp5127> which ruleset are they using
[4:16:59] <zenith0111> But Iron Giant has a pretty weak arsenal tbh...
[4:17:06] <zenith0111> He barely took tanks
[4:17:07] <AncelDeLambert> It's a stake of light and matter, Woolie
[4:17:08] <BlacSoul> No he doesnt?
[4:17:09] <zepelinnn1> WHAT IS A STAKE
[4:17:09] <worldbrand> A WOODEN NUKE
[4:17:12] <AncelDeLambert> POINTY LIGHT
[4:17:12] <+Polter_ge1st> Nah Woolie you wrong
[4:17:13] <Prevot> anything is a stake
[4:17:16] <%SilvaChariot0133> ICBM = Stake
[4:17:17] <zepelinnn1> a miserable pile of wood
[4:17:21] <artificiallynatural> Iron Giant fuses with the Big Gete Star
[4:17:22] <vadnhi> Woolie, you gotta understand. The Iron Giant was given a loss condition with that 'stake through the heart' thing. If he's staked, then no more regeneration.
[4:17:24] <Graxe_> It does not say a wooden stake
[4:17:24] <+Pompadourius> What about a missile named "the stake" with the word "stake" on it?
[4:17:25] <Prevot> even kaiju clawsare stakes
[4:17:26] <Graxe_> Just a stake
[4:17:30] <+NekoNinja13> woolie should be a politician
[4:17:31] <BlacSoul> He literally CHOSE not to use his arsenal?
[4:17:32] <DedlokPM> The card does not specify wooden stakes. There are metallic steaks
[4:17:34] <powerprotoman> minh wins
[4:17:36] <+Shady_Zaku> NUKE AINT WOOD also IRON GIANT REGENS come ooon
[4:17:37] <DedlokPM> stakes*
[4:17:41] <magboost> Kaiju claws a Steak sized
[4:17:43] <%sporeian94> sporeian94 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months, currently on a 13 month streak! Woolie how much Ram is too much Ram in a gaming PC?
[4:17:43] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @itsOnyxLeo
[4:17:45] <%SilvaChariot0133> Kaiju with a Tail-stake Kappa
[4:17:54] <zenith0111> Stakes don't have to be wooden chat woolieMIRIN_RD
[4:17:57] <+itsOnyxLeo> Nah woolie, anything pointy can be a stake!
[4:17:59] <zenith0111> Van Helsing
[4:18:02] <Reizie_Etherealm> @Dorf1 Wait, it doesn't? I thought the only reason the iron giant is considered a hero is cause he sacrificed himself and died
[4:18:02] <powerprotoman> woolie its a kaiju they dont die from nukes they get stronger
[4:18:04] <BlacSoul> Missiles are not stakes
[4:18:06] <+biggysweet> What about a well-done steak?
[4:18:09] <+itsOnyxLeo> But I think the iron giant wins!
[4:18:13] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> godzilla didn't die via nuke
[4:18:14] <AncelDeLambert> not enough emotion, Woolie, SELL me!
[4:18:24] <+invisi_bliss> missiles could work like stakes
[4:18:31] <vadnhi> Staking the Iron Giant is essentiially a big 'off' toggle. Shuts down everything, including the reassembly process.
[4:18:32] <nobody12349> IG wins actually. Nuke works against the Kaiju and is NOT a stake.
[4:18:32] <zenith0111> Stab via stake = STAB HEART
[4:18:35] <rubbishbinge> Super Robot Wars logic says pilebunkers are stakes
[4:18:38] <%Th3SmartAlec> And now we're making stuff up
[4:18:39] <+Shady_Zaku> Iron Giant wins this is dumb he has regen
[4:18:40] <+Dorf1> @Reizie_Etherealm there is a scene at the end showing all of his part are intact and he is rebuilding himself
[4:18:40] <hntronium> A missile is just a giant metal stake if you think about it
[4:18:40] <BinaryShuffle> " a pointed piece (as of wood) that is driven into the ground as a marker or a support for something " I'm gonna say a missile doesn't count
[4:18:46] <BlacSoul> MISSILES =/= STAKE
[4:18:47] <Graxe_> It's also regeneration at will
[4:18:47] <hntronium> It just explodes afterwards
[4:18:47] <magboost> Anything can be a steak if your brave enough
[4:18:55] <+biggysweet> Does that mean the Iron Giant is a vampire?
[4:19:06] <+Shady_Zaku> apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong NotLikeThis
[4:19:07] <Prevot> IT IS
[4:19:08] <Graxe_> If the kaiju wills it hard enough, its regen can keep up with the nuclear blast
[4:19:09] <zenith0111> @binaryshuffle The object in quedtion doesn't matter
[4:19:10] <%SilvaChariot0133> Penetrator
[4:19:14] <BlacSoul> IS NOT
[4:19:19] <powerprotoman> woolie cant win this unless everyone votes wrong
[4:19:22] <nobody12349> Also, the Kaiju can miss the nuke and kill itself only
[4:19:23] <NiktenKing> no it isnt. on impact it will explode. it doesnt pierce
[4:19:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> I say both are KO'D by missle. IG uses acid to deal with the Kaiju's regen
[4:19:27] <zenith0111> Destroying the heart is the objective not the stake itself.
[4:19:32] <vadnhi> Look. If you have a bigger-than-average vampire, then you need a bigger than average stake. ;)
[4:19:37] <+Namillus> There are many errors in this debate.
[4:19:43] <zenith0111> Saying it's mainly the stake misses the point of the heart
[4:19:44] <bruno_silv0> so if you want kill dracula just shoot him with a missile says mihn
[4:19:44] <+Namillus> It is constructed, if you will, on a miSTAKE
[4:19:47] <Graxe_> Also, does the Iron Giant have a heart?
[4:19:48] <+Dorf1> i think to be a stake it would have to stay in
[4:19:50] <+aversal_ammar> Would a vampire survive a nuke?
[4:19:50] <Reizie_Etherealm> @Dorf1 Never watched the movie so I honestly don't know, thanks for telling
[4:19:51] <hntronium> If the iron giant is a vampire then what could be more dangerous than a nuclear bomb, the sun is just a giant nuclear explosion after all
[4:19:53] <Graxe_> Like a physical heart?
[4:19:53] <Bludhaven_Knight> Does the IG even have a heart?
[4:19:55] <%Th3SmartAlec> @namillus on top of Woolie forgetting the ending
[4:20:00] <+Namillus> SUPERMAN
[4:20:04] <zenith0111> @bruno_silv0 Well... why not? LUL
[4:20:06] <Prevot> woolie argui ng vampires are immune to nukes
[4:20:07] <nobody12349> @bruno_silv0 I mean, yeah
[4:20:07] <DedlokPM> Missles can pierce something and then explode afterwards depending on how the arming mechanism is set up.
[4:20:11] <magboost> The IG got torn apart by the missle
[4:20:17] <+itsOnyxLeo> Woolie's got this
[4:20:29] <zenith0111> IT'S TOTALLY A DRAW
[4:20:29] <BlacSoul> And self rebuilt
[4:20:31] <Reizie_Etherealm> Bunker busters are known to do that
[4:20:31] <nobody12349> IG got torn apart but put himself back together
[4:20:33] <+Shady_Zaku> Iron Giant has REGEN already he wins
[4:20:33] <vadnhi> S U P E R P I R E
[4:20:35] <magboost> Nuke gives godzilla this
[4:20:35] <+biggysweet> If a nuke can be a steak then a pillow can be a steak because words don't mean anything anymore.
[4:20:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> is the Kaiju capable of planning that
[4:20:41] <%wydamn> Really, nuclear fission is basically sun power
[4:20:42] <+clayisack> the Kaiju will win the fight but the nuke will just split the iron giant apart and if you go by last godzilla movie then the kaiju just gets stronger
[4:20:52] <+clayisack> from the nuke
[4:20:57] <magboost> Anything hard and pointy can be a steak
[4:20:58] <zenith0111> The stake doesn't matter chat
[4:21:03] <nobody12349> Well it depends of the kaiju
[4:21:08] <cumurasame> I think this is a legit draw.
[4:21:11] <+Pompadourius> BUT BABA DOESN'T LIKE THAT
[4:21:11] <+clayisack> true
[4:21:12] <BinaryShuffle> yes
[4:21:18] <nobody12349> Pacific Rim Kaiju got wrecked by that nuke
[4:21:18] <Fetty_Krill> Minh has a man bun?
[4:21:18] <+clayisack> this is a legit draw
[4:21:21] <%wydamn> @Pompadourius LUL
[4:21:24] <+clayisack> it is a hard choice
[4:21:25] <vadnhi> @zenith0111 It *does* matter because he specifically has it as a loss condition.
[4:21:26] <bruno_silv0> mihn didnt specify the kaiju so that is irrelevant
[4:21:31] <+clayisack> true
[4:21:33] <Reizie_Etherealm> If the stake doesn't matter then the nuke explosion can knock them both out for all I know
[4:21:45] <worldbrand> depending on the type of missile we're talking about here, they're not even pointy
[4:21:46] <%SilvaChariot0133> Blow up IG with Nuke, use tail-stake to pierce whatever is left of the heart, EZ LUL
[4:21:48] <zenith0111> @vadnhi Stake to heart meaning the heart is the objective not the stake
[4:22:10] <zenith0111> It's a logic check really
[4:22:10] <%Th3SmartAlec> Both can survive the missile
[4:22:17] <rubbishbinge> IGs stake condition give it a death condition though
[4:22:19] <BlacSoul> MY NUMBER BIGGER
[4:22:19] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1207129758447939586?s=19
[4:22:23] <nobody12349> Shoot the nuke and kill the Kaiju if it's from PR.
[4:22:25] <+Shady_Zaku> NotLikeThis
[4:22:27] <+biggysweet> I think the trapper would still win tbh
[4:22:32] <Graxe_> Yeah, vampire rules is just destroy the heart
[4:22:33] <%jinking79> both r to damn strong
[4:22:34] <zenith0111> @rubbishbinge Stake is a the condition the heart is
[4:22:40] <magboost> Trapper v. Iron Giant
[4:22:41] <zenith0111> isnt'
[4:22:48] <+Polter_ge1st> Kaiju can absorb the nuke to add to it's Atomic Breath
[4:22:49] <nobody12349> IG has a death condition but that's it's only condition
[4:22:51] <Reizie_Etherealm> Nuke the IG to dismantle it then the Kaiju regen faster so he gets up and go find a stake to stab the robot while the robot parts are scattered
[4:22:53] <BlacSoul> IG also regens
[4:23:05] <%SilvaChariot0133> Kaiju EZ
[4:23:08] <+Shady_Zaku> Iron Giants huge plasma blast could
[4:23:10] <vadnhi> Look. That Turn-inside-out-touch thing is, admittredly, storng, but it can't be a 'I've got this so I win absolutely all matchups' card. :/
[4:23:15] <+Polter_ge1st> Kaiju EZ
[4:23:16] <nobody12349> Minh needs to say if it's PR or Godzilla flat out
[4:23:17] <%jinking79> auto rebuild
[4:23:18] <+aversal_ammar> The mecha’s heart of course
[4:23:21] <Halospaz117> THE GIANT SURVIVED DAMMIT
[4:23:27] <%Th3SmartAlec> @reizie_etherealm that's assuming regen is faster
[4:23:32] <+Nobara> What the hell did i Just walk into Iron Giant?
[4:23:40] <@Menitta> I need to watch KOTM
[4:23:44] <vadnhi> There's gotta be a friggin' counter to the inside-out touch.
[4:23:48] <+biggysweet> The IG has a drill for a heart. He wins.
[4:23:48] <%SilvaChariot0133> Radiation-resistant Kaiju Kappa
[4:23:48] <clonexsniperx> can't a kaiju grab a tree and stab it the iron giant with it?
[4:23:49] <%Th3SmartAlec> @nobara Woolie exposed as forgetting Iron Giant survived
[4:23:59] <Reizie_Etherealm> Minh just has to say it's faster then it will be faster than IG's regen
[4:24:00] <zenith0111> @clonexsniperx TRUE
[4:24:03] <zenith0111> WISE
[4:24:12] <Prevot> big wrong votes
[4:24:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> hmmm
[4:24:21] <worldbrand> LUL
[4:24:22] <Reizie_Etherealm> LUL
[4:24:24] <BlacSoul> LUL
[4:24:27] <zenith0111> LUL
[4:24:27] <+Shady_Zaku> oh fuck ooof
[4:24:27] <hntronium> Nukes make Kaiju stronger
[4:24:31] <+Leon_Spencer> Kaijus are ment to survive nukes
[4:24:34] <zenith0111> This was fun LUL
[4:24:34] <%SilvaChariot0133> Recount, SHenanigans in play
[4:24:35] <@Menitta> So not like Cell
[4:24:38] <bruno_silv0> and with that mihn just lost
[4:24:38] <%Th3SmartAlec> next
[4:24:39] <vadnhi> Survival insitict is just chemicals, Woolie. ;)
[4:24:43] <%jinking79> thinking of Cell from DBZ
[4:24:44] <powerprotoman> super wrong chocie won
[4:24:48] <BlacSoul> Certain kaiju
[4:24:50] <%SilvaChariot0133> Tail?
[4:25:10] <nobody12349> Clone Sniper mentioned you just need a tree
[4:25:10] <+Pompadourius> Virgin: thinking of Cell from DBZ as an example of insane regen. Chad: thinking of Wolverine about insane regen
[4:25:10] <rubbishbinge> Godzilla Earth
[4:25:21] <%SilvaChariot0133> unless it just resists it?
[4:25:22] <Reizie_Etherealm> Minh has to say the nuke makes the kaiju stronger and that'd be it
[4:25:24] <+Vigonept> bone stake tail bam
[4:25:35] <Graxe_> Not unless the regen is faster than the blast itself
[4:25:36] <%Th3SmartAlec> but does the soul still burn (with acid)?
[4:25:43] <%Kazuhira_Boat> Iron Giant Survivrs the nuke
[4:25:43] <nobody12349> Isn't Deadpool even higher tier regen than Wolvie?
[4:25:46] <Overloard> but what if it's a kaiju based of an insectoid
[4:25:50] <zenith0111> Rounds over time to let it go woolieGASM
[4:25:50] <+itsOnyxLeo> Woolie won super hard
[4:25:52] <Reizie_Etherealm> If the regen is fast af then it's possible
[4:26:00] <%jinking79> this is what happens when u don't wait enuff Kaiju movies
[4:26:00] <powerprotoman> nah he super lost
[4:26:01] <+Polter_ge1st> Big Wrong
[4:26:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie, Iron Giant survives the movie
[4:26:04] <Graxe_> Nuclear blasts aren't instant
[4:26:04] <Prevot> big disagree woolie
[4:26:05] <+Shady_Zaku> Iron Giant wins he has REGEN TOO
[4:26:07] <powerprotoman> HUGE wrong woolie
[4:26:09] <hntronium> Minh needs to put more points into speech
[4:26:11] <+Polter_ge1st> IG should have lost
[4:26:11] <Graxe_> They're fast, but will in instant
[4:26:11] <%SilvaChariot0133> apatBig apatWrong
[4:26:12] <Halospaz117> We only disagree on the fact that THE GIANT LIVED
[4:26:15] <BlacSoul> Hold that Dub
[4:26:23] <Overloard> minh could have gone off about the type of kaiju he was
[4:26:31] <zenith0111> But I think Cell could take a nuke
[4:26:35] <Reizie_Etherealm> Minh could've won but his presentation was too limited
[4:26:36] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[4:26:38] <+Leon_Spencer> if a Kaiju was killable by a nuke they wouldn't be a problem
[4:26:44] <Graxe_> Cell can totally take a nuke
[4:26:49] <BlacSoul> nope
[4:26:49] <%Th3SmartAlec> ...
[4:26:51] <+biggysweet> lost
[4:26:51] <@Menitta> Its like that Ace Attorney case
[4:26:54] <zenith0111> What
[4:26:54] <+Shady_Zaku> Iron Giant wins
[4:26:55] <bruno_silv0> oof
[4:26:55] <+Pompadourius> @nobody12349 Unless he has something on the feat list of regenerating from a single cell with everything else disintegrated, then no.
[4:26:59] <rubbishbinge> If Minh used Godzilla Earth, he woulda stomped
[4:27:00] <Prevot> it doesnt have legs tho
[4:27:00] <vadnhi> No Kaju worth it's salt has *ever* been killed by simple nukes...
[4:27:00] <+biggysweet> Still needs a steak
[4:27:01] <BinaryShuffle> gonna need about 3.50
[4:27:01] <magboost> Machine guns are tiny steaks
[4:27:02] <zenith0111> Say that again
[4:27:02] <Graxe_> it doesn't say what kind of ammo
[4:27:06] <%Th3SmartAlec> IG wins, no contest
[4:27:07] <+Dorf1> how can the lochness stake him
[4:27:07] <hntronium> Nukes are weaksauce to cell
[4:27:17] <%Th3SmartAlec> IT DOESNT HAVE ARMS
[4:27:21] <+Polter_ge1st> Doesn't specify the ammo
[4:27:23] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[4:27:23] <+biggysweet> Neither does the Iron Giant
[4:27:23] <%jinking79> the Flash running firing bullets
[4:27:27] <+Shady_Zaku> Machine guns LITERALLY HAVE NO EFFECT on Iron Giant
[4:27:28] <zenith0111> OMG
[4:27:31] <vadnhi> THE IRON GIANT DOESN"T EITHER, THO
[4:27:32] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> PogChamp
[4:27:32] <clonexsniperx> but its machine gun legs can shoot stakes
[4:27:33] <BlacSoul> but this one does tho
[4:27:34] <SuperKirby24> hayai LUL
[4:27:35] <+Nobara> But the Iron Giant Does?
[4:27:39] <%FrostedZaibatsu> Counte!!!!
[4:27:40] <worldbrand> it does now- and they're machine guns
[4:27:42] <seylumiue> Machine gun legs are useless underwater
[4:27:42] <+CarlosEoM> h-hayai
[4:27:44] <zenith0111> The fucking ass pull
[4:27:45] <DedlokPM> Not a stake
[4:27:45] <Graxe_> It has legs now
[4:27:46] <NiktenKing> iron giant either... cause its underrated
[4:27:47] <%Th3SmartAlec> Fins, legs
[4:27:50] <%RioGascar> ah shit guys IRON GIANTS REAL
[4:27:54] <ohgodscorpions> its faster than its own bullets it just accidentally shoots itself
[4:27:55] <hntronium> You've never seen Nessie Woolie
[4:27:56] <BlacSoul> but this one dooes tho
[4:28:14] <%jinking79> how do u know Woolie she faster than a speeding bullet
[4:28:15] <Kazic5000> @Shady_Zaku These machineguns are kaiju leg caliber though
[4:28:17] <magboost> The ammo could be anything
[4:28:18] <NeroInfinite> It's faster than bullet though
[4:28:20] <+Polter_ge1st> Allow me to cut through your words
[4:28:22] <Reizie_Etherealm> The legs are underneath the water so the pics we've seen of Lochness isn't even his final form LUL
[4:28:22] <%SilvaChariot0133> Tail-stake, but one fight too late FailFish
[4:28:28] <Overloard> other way round punch mom
[4:28:30] <NiktenKing> LUL
[4:28:32] <zenith0111> LUL
[4:28:35] <%Kazuhira_Boat> Punch Mom is Wining me over
[4:28:36] <vadnhi> That's definitely how evolution works. :)
[4:28:37] <+Pompadourius> @Polter_ge1st NO, THAT'S WRONG!
[4:28:40] <+Shady_Zaku> nessie has fine anyway not legs
[4:28:44] <BlacSoul> Gatlings are TECHNICALLY machine guns
[4:28:45] <+Shady_Zaku> fins
[4:28:46] <worldbrand> what is a bullet but a tiny stake?
[4:28:57] <NeroInfinite> Wouldn't it shoot itself? 🤔
[4:28:58] <BlacSoul> but this is also true
[4:28:59] <+invisi_bliss> rust the iron giant
[4:28:59] <bruno_silv0> also machine guns under water are useless
[4:29:03] <%RioGascar> dont machine guns do something
[4:29:09] <BinaryShuffle> Plesiosaur don't have legs (at least I think that's what Nessie is)
[4:29:09] <zenith0111> Almost had no effect but it's implied he can be damaged
[4:29:14] <+Shady_Zaku> machine guns are weaksauce against IG and useless too underwater
[4:29:22] <Graxe_> What about a missile?
[4:29:22] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:29:27] <zenith0111> Ie the beginning of the movie where he has a dent he can't fix.
[4:29:29] <%Th3SmartAlec> i think the stake card is a bad card
[4:29:29] <magboost> Nessy becomes the Steak
[4:29:34] <hntronium> Bullets are just tiny stakes
[4:29:34] <%jinking79> what type of bullets r their armor perusing
[4:29:44] <nobody12349> Has to be metal or wooden
[4:29:46] <%RioGascar> this game is now just
[4:29:48] <BlacSoul> railroad spikes are considerd stakes
[4:29:53] <%RioGascar> EVERYTHING IS A STAKE
[4:29:55] <+Nobara> But Iron Giant doeesnt have a "Heart" to stake
[4:29:55] <ohgodscorpions> if you have the barrels full of water when you shoot the machine guns are likely to blow up anyway
[4:29:58] <vadnhi> Nessie also adapts to biologically produce gunpowder, in addition to ammo for it's own machine-gun legs.
[4:30:00] <%RioGascar> everything is a knife
[4:30:02] <+Shady_Zaku> stake has to be wooden or silver
[4:30:04] <+Polter_ge1st> @pompadourius it's been forever since I've last played it. Did I get the quote wrong?
[4:30:05] <rubbishbinge> Stake is a cylindrical thing with a more pointy end on one side
[4:30:06] <SuperKirby24> waiwut
[4:30:07] <%SilvaChariot0133> Nessie loses now FailFish
[4:30:07] <zenith0111> OH SHIT

[4:30:27] <rubbishbinge> Oh boi
[4:30:32] <Reizie_Etherealm> Lochness can't survive in space, IG can. The end
[4:30:36] <@Menitta> Iron Giant wins this for sure
[4:30:37] <vadnhi> Gravity keeps you on the ground, PunchMom.
[4:30:37] <Graxe_> It's not
[4:30:38] <+Pompadourius> @Polter_ge1st No, I just used a quote of my own :D
[4:30:39] <DedlokPM> a fleshy thing running into a metallic body at the speed of a bullet would become a splat
[4:30:42] <NiktenKing> wrong
[4:30:44] <%RioGascar> gravity is reversed so...floats into space
[4:30:45] <rubbishbinge> IG is unanimous
[4:30:47] <BlacSoul> JUST LIKE KARS
[4:30:51] <magboost> Gravey just pulls you up now
[4:30:51] <SuperKirby24> if reverse gravity is it reverse magnitude or direction Kappa

[4:30:55] <+Shady_Zaku> IRON GOANT FLIES WOOLIE
[4:31:00] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> woolie wins
[4:31:01] <+Nobara> reverse does not equal off

[4:31:08] <NeroInfinite> a rocket launcher
[4:31:09] <%TheOneUpWarrior> just gettin back which one they playin now?
[4:31:09] <Graxe_> That's not zero gravity
[4:31:10] <NiktenKing> woolie... that's not what reverse gravity is
[4:31:11] <%SilvaChariot0133> >REVERSED<
[4:31:11] <magboost> Nessy is still fast
[4:31:12] <@Menitta> Its not that there's no gravity. There's negative gravity
[4:31:12] <+cvp5127> inertia
[4:31:12] <NeroInfinite> LUL
[4:31:14] <hntronium> Woolie, Inertia still exists in space
[4:31:18] <DedlokPM> The recoil force of a gun would not be fast
[4:31:20] <%SilvaChariot0133> not nulled, REVERESED
[4:31:21] <%jinking79> the monster has been used to floating
[4:31:22] <Reizie_Etherealm> Ok but if the machine gun fires constantly the velocity STACKS
[4:31:23] <%RioGascar> what is fucking NEGATIVE GRAVITY
[4:31:25] <vadnhi> So, mass pushes things away from itself.
[4:31:25] <%SilvaChariot0133> *reversed
[4:31:25] <+Polter_ge1st> the Machine Gun can shoot stakes
[4:31:30] <NeroInfinite> woolie there's still inertia in space
[4:31:33] <%RioGascar> So what it pushs up?
[4:31:34] <+aversal_ammar> Woolie doesn’t know what gravity is
[4:31:35] <+invisi_bliss> hahaha
[4:31:36] <zenith0111> NEGATIVE GRAVITY
[4:31:39] <NiktenKing> negative gravity is sound
[4:31:40] <nobody12349> FUCK
[4:31:41] <%SilvaChariot0133> LUL
[4:31:41] <BinaryShuffle> OH SNAP
[4:31:43] <Prevot> LUL
[4:31:44] <+Shady_Zaku> OH FUCK
[4:31:44] <magboost> Ha
[4:31:44] <rubbishbinge> The issue is no air in space
[4:31:45] <@Menitta> @RioGascar Gravity is reversed
[4:31:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> GAME CHANGER
[4:31:46] <SuperKirby24> ow my ears LUL
[4:31:47] <+Vigonept> GET FUCKED
[4:31:47] <%SilvaChariot0133> NEVER MIND WE BACK
[4:31:47] <NeroInfinite> Guns ARE USELESS UNDERWATER LOL
[4:31:47] <+Leon_Spencer> what?
[4:31:47] <+Polter_ge1st> OH SHIT
[4:31:49] <Prevot> Get fucked woolie
[4:31:51] <%RioGascar> ...
[4:31:52] <+Nobara> negative gravity undersea
[4:31:53] <kunaiiiz> LUL
[4:31:54] <BlacSoul> FUCK EVERYTHING
[4:31:55] <+Shady_Zaku> WE GOT A MATCH
[4:31:56] <vadnhi> Now the ball is back in Nessie's court. :P
[4:31:57] <+cvp5127> an ocean in space
[4:31:59] <Graxe_> It means the water is up
[4:31:59] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> atpCap
[4:32:00] <rubbishbinge> Oh no
[4:32:01] <%wydamn> Sealab 2021
[4:32:02] <Prevot> RUST
[4:32:03] <BinaryShuffle> you sink up?
[4:32:04] <zenith0111> WHAT IS THIS CLOWN MATCH
[4:32:04] <BlacSoul> OCEANS IN SPACE
[4:32:07] <@Menitta> the ocean is now space
[4:32:08] <SuperKirby24> so water is crushing you?
[4:32:08] <Graxe_> Everything sinks up
[4:32:09] <%jinking79> that fuckin perfect
[4:32:11] <@Menitta> and space is the ocean
[4:32:13] <+Leon_Spencer> Your still in space
[4:32:14] <Graxe_> Yeah, the ocean is space
[4:32:15] <magboost> This is a timed match
[4:32:15] <+Pompadourius> Is this a Stand battle?
[4:32:16] <%Th3SmartAlec> UNDERWATER CHINESE GHOST BASE
[4:32:17] <NeroInfinite> this is some clownmatch ups here
[4:32:18] <%SilvaChariot0133> Send Help, I just died
[4:32:18] <BlacSoul> HE RIGHT
[4:32:18] <+Polter_ge1st> The Machine Gun Can Shoot Stakes
[4:32:19] <+biggysweet> We Blitzball now bois
[4:32:21] <%RioGascar> it would i think crush everything
[4:32:21] <seylumiue> Spiral ocean??
[4:32:22] <@Menitta> LUL
[4:32:27] <Reizie_Etherealm> @Th3SmartAlec LUL
[4:32:28] <%SilvaChariot0133> literally dead on the floor
[4:32:28] <NiktenKing> negative gravity is exhibited by sound. it naturally pulls away from other bodies of mass
[4:32:34] <magboost> Can nessy killd the IG before they reach space
[4:32:35] <zenith0111> I'M SO CONFUSED
[4:32:40] <+Shady_Zaku> still nessie has nothing to harm IG
[4:32:54] <zenith0111> @niktenking calebW I don't understand
[4:32:55] <%Th3SmartAlec> NO
[4:32:57] <nobody12349> You going up
[4:32:57] <Graxe_> No
[4:33:00] <+Nobara> but you don't sink because of gravity its because of boyance right?
[4:33:00] <Graxe_> You fall up
[4:33:01] <+Dorf1> if you are under water than the machine guns are ruined
[4:33:02] <Reizie_Etherealm> Fun fact: this is how David Cage writes his game
[4:33:02] <+Pompadourius> GRAVITY CANCEL! That sounds like some sick tech.
[4:33:02] <+biggysweet> All I see is that they are fighting in the Blitzball arean in FF10
[4:33:03] <+Polter_ge1st> The Machine Gun Can Shoot Stakes
[4:33:04] <vadnhi> Now... Important question... Is the Iron Giant also a Spacenoid?
[4:33:04] <Graxe_> Instead of down
[4:33:05] <+griffball13> gravity reversed means you flaot up right
[4:33:05] <@Menitta> Nah -9.81 m/s/s
[4:33:05] <ohgodscorpions> thats negated not reversed
[4:33:06] <+Shady_Zaku> gravity canceled it not the same as reversed
[4:33:07] <%Th3SmartAlec> UPWARDS
[4:33:11] <%jinking79> IG weapons has never been used in water
[4:33:12] <DedlokPM> gravity reversed would be upwards
[4:33:13] <BinaryShuffle> nope, fall upwards
[4:33:21] <+Leon_Spencer> gravity revers is pushing
[4:33:24] <Mr_Zero5232> So SeaLab2021 then, where's Pesh?
[4:33:28] <vadnhi> Yeah. mass repels stuff.
[4:33:33] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie right for once
[4:33:35] <%RioGascar> So if its 0 gravity in water
[4:33:43] <%RioGascar> Would it just...bring water together
[4:33:47] <%RioGascar> and CRUSH IT?
[4:33:49] <@Menitta> Most things would be fucked from this
[4:33:57] <@Menitta> Iron Giant? Nah
[4:34:02] <+biggysweet> Everyone is flung into space
[4:34:08] <vadnhi> Oh yeah. All the spectators are SUPER dead.
[4:34:14] <BlacSoul> Can i post a straw poll?
[4:34:14] <Graxe_> The water would move with them, yes
[4:34:18] <Graxe_> If they were underwater
[4:34:21] <+Leon_Spencer> it can just wait till there in space
[4:34:22] <%RioGascar> man this is REAL jojo fight
[4:34:28] <%RioGascar> This is just jojo the card game
[4:34:34] <%jinking79> still in water
[4:34:39] <zenith0111> I'm so confused
[4:34:42] <vadnhi> Eath is totes screwed, but hey, at least we got a cool fight out of it. ;)
[4:34:46] <+Polter_ge1st> Th Machine Gun Could Shoot Stakes
[4:34:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> @riogascar no...in fact, reverse gravity would actually cause all atoms to push away from each other.
[4:34:58] <%RioGascar> oh
[4:35:04] <+ThatOneGameTester> denied
[4:35:11] <%RioGascar> So...really fucked
[4:35:13] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> bullet can't penetrate
[4:35:13] <+Shady_Zaku> technically Iron Giant has no actual heart
[4:35:14] <+Nobara> does it have a "heart"?
[4:35:14] <@Menitta> This is some Mario Galaxy shit
[4:35:15] <+Dorf1> even if it did the bullet wouldnt penetrate to get the heart
[4:35:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> ...BUT ITS NOT A STAKE. The stake card is terrible
[4:35:21] <+Polter_ge1st> It doesn't have to be bullets It can shoot Stakes
[4:35:24] <nobody12349> Superfight or otherwise known as "What can I bullshit into being a stake?"
[4:35:27] <vadnhi> So is the inside-out card, really.
[4:35:29] <+ThatOneGameTester> what is this a depleted uranium shell or something?
[4:35:30] <Prevot> anything is a stake guys
[4:35:31] <+invisi_bliss> iron giants uses acid Kappa
[4:35:32] <magboost> yeah but these are stakes strong enught to move nessy
[4:35:33] <%Th3SmartAlec> BUT THERES NO ROOM TO MOVE
[4:35:36] <DedlokPM> @RioGascar being inside of a underwater research base does not mean they are in the water. They are in a base inside water. If they get outside of the base, then they would be in the water.
[4:35:37] <%Kazuhira_Boat> N O

[4:35:48] <NiktenKing> no you
[4:35:48] <NeroInfinite> gravity is reversed
[4:35:48] <magboost> These are strong bullits
[4:35:51] <+Leon_Spencer> i like full debate rules
[4:35:51] <+Shady_Zaku> GUNS DONT WORK UNDERWATER usually
[4:35:52] <+Polter_ge1st> Punchmom should pull the sleep on the couch card
[4:35:56] <$LiquidShake83> woolie using disney rules
[4:36:04] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie theyre in a base
[4:36:18] <ohgodscorpions> bullets dont go through armor that thick 20mm armor peircing can only punch through about 3.5 inches
[4:36:26] <zenith0111> caleb5H caleb5H caleb5H caleb5H
[4:36:26] <+Polter_ge1st> Woolie they're in doors
[4:36:27] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:36:29] <DedlokPM> @Shady_Zaku guns would not be able to heart Only Dies from a Stake through the heart Iron Giant
[4:36:31] <hntronium> WHAT
[4:36:37] <hntronium> WOOLIE YOU MAKE NO SENSE
[4:36:38] <%Th3SmartAlec> ....
[4:36:46] <hntronium> WHAT IS THIS ARGUMENT EVEN
[4:36:48] <+soundcloud_raptor> i just got here and lol wut
[4:36:50] <Bludhaven_Knight> Bullets won't reach escape velocity. IG can.
[4:36:54] <Prevot> the monster can move at high speeds PERIOD
[4:37:03] <+Leon_Spencer> "Next you're gonna say...!"
[4:37:05] <vadnhi> When you think about it, with gravity reversed, all of Earth would just be one ... You know what? I realize how assinie this argument was about halfway through... :P
[4:37:15] <nobody12349> Bullet can't go through
[4:37:21] <+Polter_ge1st> False, Jetpack Joyride proves that you can propel yourself with Machine Gun Fire
[4:37:22] <powerprotoman> and then your in the water WHICH IS WHAT THE LOCHNESS MONSTER LIVES IN
[4:37:22] <zenith0111> caleb5H caleb5H caleb5H caleb5H caleb5H caleb5H
[4:37:30] <+Polter_ge1st> The Machine Gun Can Shoot Stakes
[4:37:32] <+Shady_Zaku> nessie won't survive space
[4:37:40] <ohgodscorpions> that leb is going into space with you
[4:37:43] <AltTab> what did i walk into? what the game called?
[4:37:43] <%Th3SmartAlec> they're arguing different things. Woolie.doesnt have to make sense because his deck is so stacked
[4:37:50] <zenith0111> LUL
[4:38:00] <BinaryShuffle> LUL
[4:38:03] <+tierst> Isn’t the iron giant a pacifist?
[4:38:09] <+Polter_ge1st> Talk no Jutsu
[4:38:12] <+cvp5127> talk no jutsu
[4:38:12] <vadnhi> This whole game is essenitally a version of that schoolyard game where kids say "I've got a death ray!" :Yeah, well, I have an anti-death ray field that never runs out!"... Just for adults.
[4:38:14] <%wydamn> That's some dumb shit but I believe it
[4:38:15] <Prevot> man is very wrong but also very loud so who knows
[4:38:19] <DedlokPM> @Prevot yeah but high speed into a metal chasis would just be broken bones or a splat on the body. At worst it would be a nessie shaped dent in the body
[4:38:20] <rubbishbinge> IG goes battle mode since Nessie is armed
[4:38:21] <cassiecagedd> wooliePOYO
[4:38:21] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> woolieLORE

[4:42:50] <%SilvaChariot0133> Tribbles lose now
[4:42:50] <NeroInfinite> Pfft
[4:42:58] <+Shady_Zaku> tibbles cant even speak tho?
[4:43:06] <seylumiue> They make noise
[4:43:06] <zenith0111> Dubstep-zilla
[4:43:08] <vadnhi> The tribbles can drop colonies, but Godzilla can DROP THE BEAT!
[4:43:09] <Prevot> thats an easy fucking win
[4:43:09] <BlacSoul> Ghidorazilla
[4:43:11] <+Leon_Spencer> Poison goji got it
[4:43:13] <BlacSoul> easy
[4:43:13] <+ThatOneGameTester> all they do is reproduce and eat
[4:43:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> Tribbles wilo
[4:43:15] <NeroInfinite> yeah but they're armed with nukes and mutlitply infinitly
[4:43:22] <ohgodscorpions> the zilla is just too stronk
[4:43:33] <nobody12349> Which Godzilla?
[4:43:33] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1207129758447939586?s=19
[4:43:42] <+Nobara> its rabbits on steriods
[4:43:42] <DedlokPM> @Shady_Zaku they do make noises. Could be a language that we simply don't understand.
[4:43:50] <Prevot> godzilla doesn't die to nukes and each heat you kill becomes two
[4:44:08] <zenith0111> Myxomitosis those little bastards
[4:44:13] <+Shady_Zaku> ueah but what station would get that? tibbles arent technologically advanced
[4:44:14] <%Th3SmartAlec> the car will burst open
[4:44:17] <+ThatOneGameTester> some will fall out eventually
[4:44:19] <BinaryShuffle> only the two tribbles are stuck in there
[4:44:20] <NeroInfinite> ah the car thing is the lynchpin
[4:44:28] <nobody12349> Godzilla could wipe them out with multi atomic breaths
[4:44:34] <Reizie_Etherealm> My argument is that is the nukes will wipe out the tribbles while Godzilla gets powered by the nukes
[4:44:34] <NiktenKing> oh shit
[4:44:36] <Prevot> LUL
[4:44:36] <ohgodscorpions> power wheels are godzillas greatest weakness
[4:44:37] <powerprotoman> 9 atomci breaths
[4:44:39] <vadnhi> Godzilla can just tuck his multiple heads between his legs and fire his breath to fly, too. :)
[4:44:47] <+griffball13> if the dubstep gun is huge then it will destroy things
[4:44:48] <+Shady_Zaku> YEEAA
[4:44:53] <zenith0111> Excite you to death woolieGASM
[4:44:54] <+Shady_Zaku> DO IT YOU BASTARD
[4:44:58] <NiktenKing> minh with the big opinions
[4:45:13] <+Shady_Zaku> brrwaaabrrwaaabrwaaaaa
[4:45:15] <vadnhi> You really only need one and some food, tho.
[4:45:16] <+Dylanmcmonster> Dylanmcmonster subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! <3
[4:45:19] <%SilvaChariot0133> they are stuck in the car tho
[4:45:27] <vadnhi> Tribbles are born pregnant.
[4:45:28] <nobody12349> Godzilla could take those 16 tribbles
[4:45:40] <zenith0111> True
[4:45:50] <+MachoMadnesss94> Sup guys
[4:45:52] <rubbishbinge> Godzilla Earth successfully eliminated all life
[4:45:57] <Graxe_> Tribbles are born pregnant and have litters of 10
[4:45:57] <NeroInfinite> orbital bombardment isn't always anuke
[4:45:58] <Kazic5000> STUCK IN A ELECTRIC CAR THO
[4:46:04] <Thakan_dar> The entire klingon empire needed to declare war on tribbles. Godzilla has no chance
[4:46:05] <%SilvaChariot0133> STUCK IN THE CAR
[4:46:05] <NeroInfinite> IT canbe anything
[4:46:07] <nobody12349> The orbital bombardment would wipe out the 32 tribbles
[4:46:11] <ohgodscorpions> infinite space lasers
[4:46:22] <%SilvaChariot0133> ONE CAR
[4:46:27] <vadnhi> Tribbles are pretty good at surviving through numbers, but it doesn't mean that they're that good at withstanding radiation.
[4:46:29] <+griffball13> it depends if the 48 tribbles can bust out of the car with enough of them
[4:46:33] <%Th3SmartAlec> YEYEYE use the technical ith!
[4:46:35] <NeroInfinite> It could be a rod from god or a laser
[4:46:36] <%RioGascar> military bombardment DOES NOTHING to godzilla
[4:46:45] <zenith0111> WHAT IF IT'S A BIG CAR
[4:46:45] <%RioGascar> Military IS WORTHLESS against godzilla
[4:46:46] <+Shady_Zaku> tribbles are in themselves harmless though
[4:46:47] <BinaryShuffle> die by death
[4:46:48] <Reizie_Etherealm> LUL
[4:46:49] <SuperKirby24> keep dying by death LUL
[4:46:49] <nobody12349> A whole park? Godzilla could take down the planet.
[4:46:49] <ohgodscorpions> and each tribble is born in a power wheels
[4:46:57] <Zebroneath> Isn't Godzilla born from nuclear energy?
[4:46:58] <vadnhi> People die when they are killed. :/
[4:46:58] <+griffball13> people die when they are killed
[4:46:59] <+Shady_Zaku> people die when they are killed
[4:46:59] <@Menitta> The car will break
[4:47:00] <NiktenKing> dying by death
[4:47:00] <Prevot> tribbles die when they are killed
[4:47:06] <Novillion> Minh the poet
[4:47:06] <%SilvaChariot0133> Stuck >IN< the car
[4:47:07] <NiktenKing> sbfpVita sbfpVita sbfpVita sbfpVita sbfpVita
[4:47:07] <bruno_silv0> people die if they are killed
[4:47:11] <@Menitta> Just the first 2
[4:47:11] <nobody12349> Stuck in there
[4:47:11] <NeroInfinite> Yeah but then EXTRMANINATUS
[4:47:12] <seylumiue> What if its a kinetic bombardment
[4:47:30] <+Scanford> tribbles require food to reproduce
[4:48:00] <Prevot> what
[4:48:07] <zenith0111> HOL UP
[4:48:07] <@Menitta> This is like the ending to Lego City Undercover
[4:48:08] <Reizie_Etherealm> SICK
[4:48:08] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> PogChamp
[4:48:10] <BlacSoul> GOJI IN A DINO
[4:48:11] <SheefEatsBeef> holy shit
[4:48:14] <%Th3SmartAlec> ...doesn't change anything tbh
[4:48:15] <BlacSoul> THATS RAD
[4:48:18] <Louie_Salmon> Okay, one good hit and this is OVER
[4:48:19] <NeroInfinite> Exterminatus goes beyond nukes and can be antio biological bombardments too
[4:48:21] <Kazic5000> By the same rules of language. If a common cold can be EQUIPPED with a lightsaber, tribbles can be STUCK in an electric car.
[4:48:22] <senfood> We're going full anime now.
[4:48:22] <nobody12349> Knock the mecha the tribbles are in into the volcanoe
[4:48:24] <BlacSoul> BUT ITS COOL
[4:48:51] <+griffball13> thats not how a hydra works
[4:48:51] <hntronium> Goji got this
[4:48:53] <+Shady_Zaku> Goji can toss em I to the volcano
[4:48:57] <zenith0111> woolieMIRIN_RD woolieMIRIN_RD woolieMIRIN_RD woolieMIRIN_RD
[4:49:00] <cassiecagedd> not how hydras work
[4:49:07] <Prevot> each head you cut grows into two
[4:49:09] <seylumiue> The toddler car is just the cockpit for the dino mech
[4:49:10] <cassiecagedd> they just keep growing heads
[4:49:16] <zenith0111> But that's how Godzilla Hydra works!
[4:49:17] <vadnhi> Tribbles are weak against dubstep, owing to the fact that they have no true legs to dance properly.
[4:49:20] <nobody12349> Reggie, Tribbles don't have the power to kill Godzilla. Even with the orbital strikes.
[4:49:39] <+Shady_Zaku> Goji too stronk
[4:49:50] <%Th3SmartAlec> the best the tribbles could do would be to reproduce infinitely and get one inside of Godzilla's body
[4:49:52] <nobody12349> Godzilla could take down hell, he can take down that Robotic Dinosaur Coffin
[4:49:52] <+Polter_ge1st> Yeah. Goji wins free
[4:49:54] <vadnhi> So much burned tribble hair...
[4:49:55] <Prevot> nothing reggie has can harm hydra godzilla at all
[4:50:10] <zenith0111> LUL
[4:50:16] <NiktenKing> you can reach petatons with orbital bombardments though
[4:50:20] <cumurasame> Hydra Godzilla would require like a giant robot with a flamethrower to win
[4:50:22] <Novillion> godzillla's not that big
[4:50:23] <zenith0111> That's a big ass volcano
[4:50:45] <cumurasame> I guess you can argue they could try to push HydraZilla into the volcano and counter the regeneration that way
[4:50:45] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:51:09] <bruno_silv0> just have infinite tribbles crawl up godzillas ass and destroy him from the inside
[4:51:13] <zenith0111> @cumurasame But the Spirit of Godzilla can always come back!
[4:51:17] <vadnhi> Godzilla doesn't mind volcanoes at all. He *LOVES* volcanoes!
[4:51:20] <NeroInfinite> LUL
[4:51:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> yeye, use that infinite respawn.
[4:51:28] <ohgodscorpions> so we now have godzilla versus 234000 tribbles
[4:51:29] <+Leon_Spencer> if each tribble gets its own lazer then that could work
[4:51:30] <NeroInfinite> Infinite tribbles up Godzilla's ass
[4:51:30] <%SilvaChariot0133> 'Cheating" with tribbles XD
[4:51:31] <nobody12349> Shove the lava up your ass
[4:51:35] <Kazic5000> If the kaiju was stuck riding the nuke, the tribbles are stuck inside the car.
[4:51:36] <cumurasame> @zenith0111 It's about the battle. not the war, my friend
[4:51:49] <DedlokPM> Oh god. now there are 468000 tribbles
[4:52:06] <SheefEatsBeef> the arena has a roof
[4:52:06] <+aversal_ammar> INFINITE TRIBBLE WORKS
[4:52:08] <%Th3SmartAlec> 4680000 already!
[4:52:09] <+Leon_Spencer> 4680000 lasers
[4:52:19] <$Noponiz> i just joined wtf is this game
[4:52:22] <vadnhi> Look. Godzilla can simply irradiate the biosphere and destroy all the foodstuffs. Tribbles starve.
[4:52:30] <bruno_silv0> those 1 million tribbles are trouble now
[4:52:50] <ohgodscorpions> they are starting to climb onto each other making a godzilla made of tribbles
[4:52:52] <nobody12349> Godzilla can fly away with one head, he can leave them to starve
[4:52:53] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie, if one gets in Godzillas body it's all over
[4:53:11] <SheefEatsBeef> truee
[4:53:20] <%SilvaChariot0133> >This same man who said that Kaiju would lose to its own nuke
[4:53:25] <rubbishbinge> Godzilla is radioactive as hell, the proximity would kill the Tribbles
[4:53:26] <nobody12349> Godzilla survived as a skeleton and willed hellbats to form his new body
[4:53:27] <DedlokPM> @Noponiz Like cards against humanity, but you have to argue your case in who would win in a fight with the conditions of the cards you play plus the ones auto played from the purple and blue cards
[4:53:27] <vadnhi> No. it gets digested. Lots of things eat tribbles all the time. It's why they started reprocing like that in the first place.
[4:53:38] <$Noponiz> sick
[4:53:45] <+stoutfish> oh is this boss fight?
[4:53:46] <cumurasame> I use Polymerization to fuse my Hydra and Godzilla!
[4:53:54] <zenith0111> @nobody12349 Dude I'm going to watch Godzilla after this Lul
[4:53:55] <NeroInfinite> super fight
[4:53:59] <+Leon_Spencer> who has the dub step gun?
[4:53:59] <DedlokPM> @stoutfish Super Fight
[4:54:07] <DedlokPM> @Leon_Spencer Godzilla
[4:54:12] <vadnhi> Godzilla
[4:54:12] <BlacSoul> 410,757,864,530 tribbles now
[4:54:14] <%Th3SmartAlec> orbital bombardments...to destroy the Earth. TIE GAME
[4:54:17] <+Leon_Spencer> stun em with the dub step gun then lasers breath
[4:54:17] <nobody12349> @zenith0111 the hellbats example is from the comics
[4:54:18] <+stoutfish> who would win the game
[4:54:25] <+Nobara> wouldnt the radiation kill all the tribbles anyway
[4:54:28] <nobody12349> Godzilla chills in space, suffocation ain't an issue
[4:54:29] <@Menitta> Shin Godzilla died tho
[4:54:38] <zenith0111> @nobody12349 Of course there'd be comics Lul
[4:54:40] <vadnhi> No. He simply went dormant
[4:54:41] <nobody12349> Shin Godzilla is a bitch
[4:54:43] <%Th3SmartAlec> 400 billion tribbles, Godzilla is a fu##
[4:54:56] <%SilvaChariot0133> LUL
[4:54:56] <rubbishbinge> Shin Godzilla became dormant and then evolved into a million humanoid godzillas
[4:55:06] <ohgodscorpions> earth would be destroyed almost instantly
[4:55:10] <SheefEatsBeef> reggie says fuck the electoral college
[4:55:23] <vadnhi> Yeah. Earth winds up f**ked in most of these battles, really.
[4:55:39] <Prevot> reggie didn't come up with a single way to hard godzilla at all
[4:55:40] <nobody12349> Vote for the winner
[4:55:42] <SuperKirby24> hidden salt party
[4:55:55] <+Leon_Spencer> it's the argument
[4:56:00] <vadnhi> These are basically DBZ battles, where you *really* hope they're taking place on another planet really far away...
[4:56:08] <BlacSoul> i thought it was the character
[4:56:19] <nobody12349> Look
[4:56:20] <%SilvaChariot0133> Cut off the head and burn the stump... WITH the bombardment
[4:56:22] <bruno_silv0> you can no longer see the blue of the oceons from space, only tribbles remain
[4:56:31] <nobody12349> House Rules > Real Rules
[4:56:51] <nobody12349> No one would like CAH if we used the exact rules
[4:56:59] <+aversal_ammar> Basically Minh got carried
[4:57:00] <+Nobara> but also Reggie never mentioned how Godzilla loses
[4:57:00] <SuperKirby24> we duelist kingdom levels of following house rules LUL
[4:57:06] <BlacSoul> You GON hold this W
[4:57:13] <rubbishbinge> Ez
[4:57:20] <ohgodscorpions> the tribbles have now outnumbered every other lifeform in the universe
[4:57:36] <cassiecagedd> NomNom
[4:57:40] <%mayorrev> kirby!
[4:57:43] <nobody12349> As long as what you're playing resembles the original concept after the house rules, it's fine

[5:05:51] <+Pompadourius> I think we're about halfway? Maybe.
[5:06:04] <%wydamn> @Tisaric fair enough. A lot of these clips are what they used back when the SBF first dipped their toes into streaming, back in the Demons Souls era.
[5:06:17] <Exdeeie> what is this

[0:19:26] <Infamousn89> The world needs more awareness for KI. its only the hypest
[0:19:26] <jubejube56> well Mick only did some of KI
[0:19:29] <peachy996> Some of those idle themes are great
[0:19:30] <+McSoliace> KI season 2 has the most consistent amount of bangers
[0:19:30] <+chesterr01> hello.
[0:19:36] <~WoolieVersus> Arcade stick issues
[0:19:36] <jubejube56> but he did arguably the best parts
[0:19:39] <+tuchpi> Season 1 was way better
[0:19:39] <+slayabee> Mick Gordon did S1 and S2
[0:19:40] <~WoolieVersus> Please hold
[0:19:41] <BusterRepukken> tfw Microsoft pretends KI doesnt exist anymore
[0:19:44] <Infamousn89> @garbagenirvana every stream is a #BringBackKI stream
[0:19:48] <cydonis137> holding
[0:19:49] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N
[0:19:51] <+tuchpi> Some of s2 was rushed or whatever, not as good
[0:20:00] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> sorry
[0:20:07] <gordieda20> Woolie Best Theme of S1
[0:20:08] <Solidnick18> anybody play general raam?
[0:20:14] <ArbyDMC> Do you think KI would have done better if it was on more than Xbone and Win 10?
[0:20:20] <SomersaultJustice> hope someone picks battletoads today
[0:20:28] <+slayabee> Also KI has SICK ASS guest characters
[0:20:38] <+tuchpi> does he play with people from the stream later?
[0:20:38] <+slayabee> Rash, Arbiter and General RAAM
[0:20:42] <+GarbageNirvana> ngl Rash was fun as hell when I played him
[0:20:45] <ArbyDMC> I need to pick up Arbiter when I have money
[0:20:50] <jubejube56> @ArbyDMC I think it would have done better but maybe had shorter life
[0:20:54] <+GarbageNirvana> Was he good? who knows
[0:20:55] <ArbyDMC> considering he's my namesake
[0:20:55] <coreybom> @busterrepukken I don't think they don't care, they're just focusing on stuff for the Xbox sex. They did respond to max about it, or at least say they do hear the people.
[0:20:55] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1207129758447939586?s=19
[0:20:55] <BusterRepukken> so Max was just in a car accident, hes ok though.
[0:20:58] <Mvrdok_> Mick sneaked the main KI melody on most (if not all) tracks
[0:21:12] <gordieda20> oh man
[0:21:15] <+tuchpi> PogChamp
[0:21:20] <Solidnick18> SourPls

[0:22:00] <BusterRepukken> "Got crushed by a truck into the wall changing lanes into ours, didn't see us at all. Cars wrecked. Will update you all with the story when I get a chance to stream again. Very thankful and lucky."
[0:22:00] <Solidnick18> astral chain ost Kreygasm
[0:22:10] <+McSoliace> there is only one meh song in KI and it's Riptor's
[0:22:33] <+GarbageNirvana> Nothing against the English vocalists here but this song most likely sounds better in its original Japanese lyrics
[0:22:33] <jubejube56> Really though this song scars me after that bloody end game boss
[0:22:37] <jubejube56> So much kiting
[0:23:00] <gordieda20> Man that sucks good thing he's ok

[0:43:57] <zayasu> @WoolieVersus keits in chat :)
[0:44:00] <Keits> those were trying times
[0:44:08] <%Hacerous> i feel like reggie should be doing this.. but this is too good
[0:44:15] <plushysceptile> I still await the day of the sudden KI character in MK11
[0:44:15] <NeroCapone> @Keits hi keits <3
[0:44:15] <rheviel> $10 is goooood buy
[0:44:23] <DeebzNutz100> Yo Keits is here? doodChamp
[0:44:33] <Keits> yes hello
[0:44:37] <+itsOnyxLeo> Why doesn't tekken have a tutorial like this?
[0:44:37] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> But Solidus that's worthless because EVERYONE in this chat already owns KI! Right? RIGHT?
[0:44:38] <$Noponiz> oh the game has proxmity normals?
[0:44:38] <%mistersups> Hi Keits!
[0:44:39] <%Hacerous> Hi Keits!
[0:44:39] <primaryfire> lord keits PogChamp
[0:44:40] <Arek_1> There's 3D fighters (Tekken, SoulCalibur, etc.,) and Mortal Kombat mid. And then there's every other fighting games's mid.
[0:44:47] <@Solidus_113> woolieFABRICATION
[0:44:49] <BusterRepukken> if you dont own KI, get banned
[0:44:57] <DeebzNutz100> doodBro @keits
[0:44:58] <BwdYeti> proximity normals are by character, they're a lot less common in the later characters
[0:44:59] <+tuchpi> KEITS PogChamp
[0:45:04] <%jinking79> man Jago was so broken in Combo Assist
[0:45:08] <BwdYeti> *by character and by button
[0:45:08] <%Aussie_Manny> @Keits new stream, who dis?
[0:45:14] <%Hacerous> ffs who doesnt own KI?! BibleThump
[0:45:16] <%Puhff> woolieFABRICATION
[0:45:21] <%mistersups> Should have saved my story about my Prof who worked on KI for this week.
[0:45:22] <+slayabee> Learn KI. Love KI. Play KI.
[0:45:24] <Tha_Mik> @busterrepukken isnt ki free?
[0:45:25] <$Noponiz> oh, so there are characters with very few/no proximity normals as well?
[0:45:31] <NeroCapone> im guaranteed to get the itch to play KI after this stream
[0:45:34] <%Aussie_Manny> @Hacerous the same people who don't own Skullgirls.
[0:45:39] <BusterRepukken> @Tha_Mik not the full game
[0:45:45] <%Hacerous> BibleThump ... true
[0:45:49] <@Solidus_113> I only own season 1 of KI
[0:45:51] <+Zinac> sup
[0:45:53] <+NeoKable_> Yo fight Max!
[0:46:06] <%Aussie_Manny> I own vanilla DBFZ and Videl. :P
[0:46:20] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Buying KI has scientifically been proven to raise your happiness levels! Source:me
[0:46:30] <BusterRepukken> KI is on sale right now, no excuse.
[0:46:50] <%Hacerous> if MS didnt have the gifting limitations..
[0:46:57] <+itsOnyxLeo> How much is it?
[0:46:58] <randominternetsurfer> @busterrepukken dont use PC and it ain't on the PS4 :(
[0:47:09] <+itsOnyxLeo> I tried the free version and didn't really care for it
[0:47:17] <@Solidus_113> Killer move to the killer groove
[0:47:26] <BusterRepukken> you got xbox?
[0:47:31] <@Solidus_113> there are autocombos
[0:47:34] <@Solidus_113> it was added
[0:47:35] <BusterRepukken> or nvm i read that wrong
[0:47:40] <+itsOnyxLeo> But that was like, 2 years ago
[0:47:54] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Simpler combos are significantly easier and don't limit you in any way
[0:47:56] <+slayabee> There is an auto combo mode. But combos are relatively easy in this game.
[0:48:05] <%Hacerous> this is assist mode.. didnt know it was in the dojo.. nice
[0:48:15] <+TheBesteban> I talked to DJames about Combo Assist for like 30 minutes the other day. I didn't realize how customizable it could be.
[0:48:30] <+absolutexero11> combos are basically normal button, then special move, then normal button again
[0:48:31] <randominternetsurfer> @busterrepukken no :(
[0:48:34] <Keits> he worked really hard on combo assist
[0:48:41] <Keits> it's a great feature
[0:48:51] <Lolzer82> howdy, folks
[0:48:58] <+slayabee> I really suggest anyone work their way through the tutorial. And try combo assist.
[0:49:00] <%Hacerous> both might be explained?
[0:49:10] <+slayabee> *anyone new
[0:49:12] <+TheBesteban> YEah we talked about it in his interview and then we played a few matches against each other with him using it. It's pretty cool
[0:49:19] <MatTrix77> Thanks to combo assist, I could play with a controller and not feel terrible about myself
[0:49:19] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:49:27] <%Hacerous> its still valid
[0:49:29] <@akuda_bar> @solidus_113 announcer is talking to you Kappa
[0:49:31] <TheWashoutXY> LUL
[0:49:33] <Lolzer82> Is woolie completely new to KI, or does he have some modicum of experience?
[0:49:42] <gordieda20> Combo assist is nice
[0:49:46] <@Solidus_113> why me
[0:49:50] <rheviel> lol
[0:49:56] <%Hacerous> just let assist nuzzle your wuzzle for a bit
[0:50:06] <@akuda_bar> keeps saying SOLID
[0:50:07] <seylumiue> For FUN
[0:50:07] <BwdYeti> combo assist is totally fine
[0:50:09] <Dragon_Batman> LUL
[0:50:10] <Keits> assist is like training wheels
[0:50:12] <@Squdnate> Autocombo's are also easy to spot and break if you know what you are doing
[0:50:14] <rheviel> valid system is valid
[0:50:15] <Enemy_In_Disguise> KI for Fun(Glory)
[0:50:15] <Solidnick18> ok
[0:50:16] <@Squdnate> So it's allll fineeeeeeeeeee
[0:50:16] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> I prefer combo assist because it means I don't have to do a quarter circle motion after every normal
[0:50:17] <%jinking79> from Fun to Glory
[0:50:20] <Keits> you can learn to play with it on
[0:50:29] <Keits> and it never gets in your way
[0:50:30] <Lolzer82> ye combo assist is alright for this game, 'cus even when you're using it, you still gotta do the mindgames
[0:50:37] <%Hacerous> who it?
[0:50:40] <%Hacerous> would*
[0:50:53] <CryptusMaximus> When you say that about easy combos, just address Pat
[0:51:05] <@Solidus_113> Assist combos will get you blown the fuck up if you're fighting someone who knows the game
[0:51:08] <%Hacerous> must easier inputs
[0:51:12] <NemokillerV> @woolieversus Thanks woolie, I legit was worried about you guys shaming me for using the combo assist
[0:51:36] <Keits> similar but good
[0:51:37] <+slayabee> Combos are like sandwiches in KI
[0:51:37] <+absolutexero11> Combos are like making a sandwich!
[0:51:42] <Keits> lots more freedom
[0:51:55] <%Hacerous> combos are more like the precursor to the mind-games
[0:51:57] <lostCambion> i mean assist combos are exactly the same as normal ones except without the special move inputs
[0:52:04] <ArbyDMC> Killer
[0:52:15] <+slayabee> WE LIVIN

[0:52:25] <seylumiue> This tutorial text ia so friendly
[0:52:25] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> This combo system is way smarter than OG KI's
[0:52:28] <+tuchpi> learning :)
[0:52:29] <rheviel> Study mode
[0:52:32] <BwdYeti> big learning
[0:52:40] <@akuda_bar> learning together solving the problems
[0:52:42] <+penndra> we're learnin and chillin TPFufun
[0:52:44] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Damn now I gotta redownload KI. Forgot how fun this was.
[0:52:44] <gordieda20> SHADOW COUNTER
[0:53:05] <%Hacerous> @Enemy_In_Disguise they always do
[0:53:07] <Lolzer82> I love KI's combo system. You're not just sitting there watching your opponent deal 40%, you can actually do something about it
[0:53:35] <@Solidus_113> it's just an idle animation
[0:53:36] <Orbeii> he got the stanky leg
[0:53:39] <BwdYeti> it's just a fidget animation
[0:53:42] <+slayabee> He's just shaking it out lol
[0:53:42] <BusterRepukken> its an animation
[0:53:42] <+absolutexero11> Hes just digging his foot in
[0:53:46] <Lolzer82> just an idle animation
[0:53:47] <BwdYeti> to break up the idle
[0:53:49] <@akuda_bar> balls stuck to thigh
[0:53:49] <Arek_1> He wiggles it a little.
[0:53:50] <ArbyDMC> DO DA STANKY LEG
[0:53:51] <Dragon_Batman> Jago is really self conscious about it
[0:54:04] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> It's great! Although I do prefer not being interrupted while I combo @lolzer82
[0:54:05] <SkreamnRedSkull> LOL
[0:54:07] <Orbeii> hes not gonna do it since we're all looking
[0:54:09] <Arek_1> @Dragon_Batman LUL
[0:54:18] <%UrielCobalt> ccccccombo breaker time
[0:54:21] <@Solidus_113> combo enders very important in KI
[0:54:21] <Keits> Jago has two idle animations layered on top of each other that blend semi randomly to make it not look like a cycle. I don't think any other character has that.
[0:54:23] <+slayabee> Its an idle animation Minh
[0:54:31] <+Zinac> I was just about to say that Keits
[0:54:35] <Dragon_Batman> Neat
[0:54:39] <MatTrix77> Jago only does the stanky leg if e's at a BEst Buy
[0:54:42] <Keits> hi chase
[0:54:44] <+absolutexero11> doodUltra doodUltra doodUltra doodUltra doodUltra
[0:54:50] <@Solidus_113> ULTRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[0:54:51] <+Zinac> yo
[0:54:55] <BwdYeti> LUL
[0:54:56] <Solidnick18> ULTRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[0:55:00] <+penndra> ultraaaaaaaaa
[0:55:07] <Lolzer82> @L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N It's certainly nice to pull off a combo you've practiced in the lab for lord knows how long, but it's also nice to get a chance to say "absolutely not, try again" and break it
[0:55:08] <ArbyDMC> announcer in this game is insane
[0:55:09] <%mayorrev> PogChamp
[0:55:14] <%jinking79> boo this man for missing ender
[0:55:18] <BwdYeti> one step closer to flushing out ultratech
[0:55:19] <Lolzer82> doodUltra
[0:55:26] <%UrielCobalt> the announcer for this series has always been hype
[0:55:26] <%Hacerous> @Keits ty and the team for having the lk+mp & lk+hp shortcuts by far my favorite feature
[0:55:33] <Enemy_In_Disguise> I can‚Äôt get mad at someone that double ultras me.
[0:55:34] <+absolutexero11> double roundhouse is a frame trap
[0:55:35] <Solidnick18> yep
[0:55:35] <+TheBesteban> Double Roundhouse is so gooood
[0:55:37] <Dragon_Batman> Good good
[0:55:41] <Keits> same, those were for me 100%
[0:55:44] <DeebzNutz100> doodGood doodGood
[0:55:55] <Keits> I needed them to break quickly on stick lol
[0:56:00] <+absolutexero11> Very plus
[0:56:00] <%Hacerous> ^^
[0:56:01] <BusterRepukken> safe on bloc
[0:56:15] <+tuchpi> woolie LUL
[0:56:28] <Keits> double roundhouse is great until people shadow counter it on reaction
[0:56:28] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:56:35] <Keits> then you realize why it's plus
[0:56:35] <jubejube56> Neck Cutter cuts the spine
[0:56:37] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> @lolzer82 Yeah I understand.
[0:56:54] <+absolutexero11> Fulgore has the same move essentially
[0:56:54] <%Hacerous> teaching lessons, Kreygasm
[0:56:59] <+slayabee> Most to all buttons are special cancelable I believe
[0:57:10] <@Solidus_113> preform mixup
[0:57:18] <Lolzer82> K I L L E R
[0:57:19] <@akuda_bar> there's going to be a pop quiz at the end y'all
[0:57:21] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> I love the text "perform mixup"
[0:57:21] <Keits> except sweeps
[0:57:22] <@akuda_bar> take notes
[0:57:38] <+slayabee> Yeah except sweeps
[0:57:48] <+slayabee> For obvious reasons
[0:57:48] <@Solidus_113> crunchy
[0:57:56] <Lolzer82> cronchy boi
[0:58:06] <TAGMANINK> GivePLZ VoHiYo
[0:58:07] <@akuda_bar> cronch
[0:58:09] <Orbeii> Lov the cronch.
[0:58:10] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> This is satisfying
[0:58:17] <Arek_1> S L A M
[0:58:24] <+absolutexero11> Yo fgc terms
[0:58:28] <BwdYeti> yo tick throws
[0:58:34] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> The animations for some of the characters are just perfect
[0:58:37] <%Hacerous> this game.. taught me fighting games
[0:58:40] <+tuchpi> s ogood
[0:58:41] <Lolzer82> actual fgc terms, hell yeah
[0:58:42] <Solidnick18> oh cool
[0:58:57] <artificiallynatural> KI teaches so much stuff. Every fighting game should take a page out of this game's tutorial
[0:59:01] <+Akizea> ohhhhh fuck its KI time
[0:59:03] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> It's great to see how fighting game tutorials evolved over time
[0:59:12] <@akuda_bar> go back to crunching i was almost there Kreygasm
[0:59:19] <Keits> only 3 characters were not 100% hand animated, we started with mocap
[0:59:20] <+tuchpi> if only more games had the KI training
[0:59:41] <Dragon_Batman> Would be perfect
[0:59:42] <+absolutexero11> I feel like KI was one of the first fighting games to have a truly useful tutorials and how to actually play
[0:59:45] <Keits> I did the mocap performance for Kan-Ra
[0:59:47] <leftoverplaceholder> does anyone else hear weird squeaks when Jago endokoukens?
[0:59:54] <%Hacerous> oh really!
[0:59:54] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Really? Which characters were hand-animated?
[1:00:00] <Dragon_Batman> That's awesome
[1:00:09] <Jetsfantasy> That's super cool, Keits
[1:00:12] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> I mean *not hand-animated
[1:00:19] <+TheBesteban> Is there video of that @Keits?
[1:00:21] <Arek_1> That's why inputting a 5 frame throw after you're +2 on block is a tick throw. And it will beat their 3 frame light normal.
[1:00:21] <+slayabee> Is that why Kan-Ra was so OP in Season 2? Kappa
[1:00:36] <Keits> Sonya from MK1 did Maya the same day. I have a photo of us in mocap suits together
[1:00:40] <@Solidus_113> Kan-Ra? You mean Rick Flair
[1:00:41] <Lolzer82> I do quite like how in-depth this tutorial gets
[1:00:56] <Dragon_Batman> LUL Rick Flair
[1:00:57] <%mistersups> I am a student one of the animators of the game. He showed us a lot of the process.
[1:01:01] <seylumiue> Its a fantastic tutorial
[1:01:08] <Keits> I don't know of any video. just have the one photo
[1:01:12] <%Hacerous> not gonna lie.. just watching the dojo is making me moar hype than some of the "for glory" vids
[1:01:27] <xiccy> That's super cool, I didn't know she was still doing mocap
[1:01:29] <+absolutexero11> Tekken
[1:01:30] <Lolzer82> Kan Ra? More like Kan Rah shit, I'm fullscreen against this lad, oh shit, oh god, oh fuck lytOUCH
[1:01:52] <olgafl0w> keits can you do me a fav can you and ig help arksys with roll back
[1:01:57] <SkreamnRedSkull> Mocap looks like it would be fun
[1:02:03] <Dragon_Batman> lol
[1:02:17] <+Akizea> i think everyone is hoping that arcsys is actually listening with GGSTrive honestly
[1:02:28] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> There are some games that require relatively precise timing for teching throws, like UNIST
[1:02:41] <Keits> @zinac and I spent a week at my apartment every day after work trying to figure out what to build for Kan-Ra gameplay
[1:02:48] <SheefEatsBeef> those particles my lawd
[1:02:57] <DeebzNutz100> Eat Yo cookie
[1:03:01] <Lolzer82> anyone know if there are any interviews with any programmers for this game? trying to learn how to become a programmer and I feel like this would be a treasure trove of knowledge
[1:03:06] <Keits> @olgafl0w tell them to call us
[1:03:26] <@Solidus_113> Oh god. I just realized the particle effects are going to make the youtube video fucking worthless
[1:03:29] <@Solidus_113> rip bitrates
[1:03:29] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1207129758447939586?s=19
[1:03:29] <Arek_1> Those particle effects are still phenomenal.
[1:03:44] <%Hacerous> doodStare
[1:03:51] <%Hacerous> moar effects!
[1:03:51] <Lolzer82> yo this game goes IN on the particles
[1:03:52] <@Squdnate> @Lolzer82 Max has videos on that. He worked with Iron Galaxy one time doing trailers for them. He did one recently with an old Iron Galaxy dev
[1:03:54] <Jetsfantasy> Yeah, but dear god are the particles gorgeous in person
[1:03:54] <+absolutexero11> KI is particle effects the game
[1:03:55] <+TheBesteban> Streaming encoders be damned
[1:03:56] <@akuda_bar> DoritosChip damage
[1:04:00] <Solidnick18> oh boy
[1:04:13] <Keits> streaming encoders hate these style of particles
[1:04:18] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Cinder vs Cinder is actually what is used to test if your PC is good enough to play the game online
[1:04:21] <Lolzer82> @Squdnate thank ye kindly, I'll go find 'em after this stream lytTHUMBSUP
[1:04:21] <MatTrix77> You've only seen a PARTicle of it
[1:04:24] <+slayabee> UPUPDURKEN
[1:04:34] <rheviel> that Dorito damage
[1:04:36] <%Hacerous> that makes a lot of sense keits
[1:04:52] <@Solidus_113> a better way to do the DP motion is to do forward and then a quarter circle. Much easier than trying to draw a Z on the stick
[1:05:16] <Jetsfantasy> Yeah, that's a good shortcut for most fighting games
[1:05:21] <%Hacerous> Getting into fighting games!
[1:05:24] <BusterRepukken> I draw a letter C for my DPs
[1:05:29] <Keits> remember at Capcom cup when the confetti fell and the stream quality went to shit?
[1:05:30] <Arek_1> That's how it is for SFV after season 1.
[1:05:34] <Keits> same reason
[1:05:35] <Dragon_Batman> LUL
[1:05:47] <Lolzer82> although it wasn't *quite* what I was asking for, but I suppose that interviews where all you get to hear about is coding doesn't make for the most interesting video
[1:05:50] <+theotherkristian> How I get into fighting
[1:05:53] <BwdYeti> reggie got it
[1:05:56] <blue6sub6remnant6> I just got here and did Reggie pick Jago?
[1:06:02] <@Solidus_113> we're training
[1:06:04] <seylumiue> He probably will lol
[1:06:06] <primaryfire> why would I ever use a medium when heavy does more damage????
[1:06:15] <Jetsfantasy> @blue6sub6remnant6 No, they're just doing training to show the mechanics
[1:06:16] <Lolzer82> @blue6sub6remnant6 just doing training at the moment
[1:06:19] <+absolutexero11> more invincibility
[1:06:25] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Is Reggie going to pick Jago or Shadow Jago? Now that is the real question
[1:06:27] <ArbyDMC> Because you can't be hurt
[1:06:33] <blue6sub6remnant6> But Reggie is a Ryu main.
[1:06:39] <Arek_1> @primaryfire Damn, Woolie's brother is here. LUL
[1:06:52] <blue6sub6remnant6> I just assumed.
[1:07:00] <ArbyDMC> Medium DP son
[1:07:02] <primaryfire> LUL
[1:07:02] <%Hacerous> when wk got nerfed... BibleThump
[1:07:11] <ArbyDMC> It hardens in response to physical trauma
[1:07:18] <+II_BoBo_II> cryDrool cryDrool
[1:07:19] <ArbyDMC> You can't hurt me, Ken.
[1:07:22] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Remember when EX kick went fullscreen?
[1:07:23] <+the22cstomp> unnerf wind kick
[1:07:28] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Those were the days
[1:07:29] <Keits> the command list in this game is amazing
[1:07:33] <Keits> so much info
[1:07:42] <Lolzer82> I feel like KI is one of the few games where you have actual ass reason to use medium DPs
[1:07:56] <+the22cstomp> combo tool
[1:07:59] <BwdYeti> it's plus on block
[1:08:06] <%Hacerous> high invincible too i think
[1:08:27] <Solidnick18> all good
[1:08:28] <@akuda_bar> i see you all spacing out, pay attention wooliePOYO
[1:08:33] <+the22cstomp> do more
[1:08:34] <+slayabee> I like learning!
[1:08:39] <blue6sub6remnant6> All three are strong options.
[1:08:41] <+slayabee> Learn is good
[1:08:41] <seylumiue> We learned!
[1:08:42] <zayasu> cant get my arcade stick to work on KI PC FeelsBadMan
[1:08:42] <BillyHashtag> Hype Killer Instinct beats to study/ chill to
[1:08:45] <artificiallynatural> but learnbing is funnn
[1:08:46] <Dragon_Batman> This is good, up to you
[1:08:46] <%Hacerous> .. it hurts..
[1:08:46] <Arek_1> What's "plus on block?" Argh, translate down! LUL
[1:08:53] <+II_BoBo_II> cryPbbt cryPbbt cryPbbt
[1:08:54] <ArbyDMC> As much as I wanna play you guys, learning is important
[1:09:01] <+tuchpi> Woolie overcomplicating the dojo Kappa
[1:09:03] <MatTrix77> Are we not entertained?
[1:09:03] <Solidnick18> i think the basics is good
[1:09:05] <masterofzin> im sure we all need woolies help with this
[1:09:15] <jubejube56> Chat wants ice cream
[1:09:16] <shadytreeofknowledge> sup Woolie
[1:09:18] <+slayabee> You're not done learning the mechanics of the game first
[1:09:19] <Jetsfantasy> @Arek_1 It means that you recover that many frames faster than the opponent. Your moves recovery is faster than their block stun
[1:09:19] <+TheBesteban> Damn, you're putting the couch to sleep
[1:09:21] <primaryfire> learning fighting important
[1:09:23] <%Hacerous> ... just destroy them woolie.. thats the best teacher..
[1:09:26] <%ultrasparkseid> learning's fun
[1:09:33] <@akuda_bar> ResidentSleeper
[1:09:35] <CryptusMaximus> Fighting Games...For Glun
[1:09:36] <Solidnick18> for fun tho
[1:09:43] <+HerdenDerden> I LOVE WOOLIE
[1:09:44] <shadytreeofknowledge> see ya billy
[1:09:50] <primaryfire> minh would be happy as a brain in a jar
[1:09:51] <ArbyDMC> Remember the Fisticuffs for Killer Instinct season 2, where they actively told Pat nothing.
[1:09:52] <Jetsfantasy> @Arek_1 Inversely, negative on block means you recover later and are at a disadvantage using that move
[1:10:05] <@akuda_bar> For Glorious Fun
[1:10:09] <%jinking79> it way better performiong it then watchin g it
[1:10:10] <Arek_1> @Jetsfantasy I was kidding. Woolie said to translate down, not up earlier, lol. But you explained it well. Kudos.
[1:10:12] <+tuchpi> Reggie's special labbing time LUL
[1:10:25] <Lolzer82> SourPls

[1:10:47] <ArbyDMC> I wanna body the shit out of everyone with TJ
[1:11:08] <Jetsfantasy> @Arek_1 My b, I just figure there's people who don't know here of all places. Hard to know when people are serious or not sometimes
[1:11:27] <+greatgetter> You can turn it off in the options menu
[1:11:28] <%Hacerous> you can go to the combo tutorial i guess.
[1:11:30] <MatTrix77> Character select or Settings
[1:11:33] <ArbyDMC> I forgot the pause menu played the KI theme
[1:11:35] <transporterthesequel> Woolie desperately trying to learn these bois up before he dumpsters them
[1:11:36] <%generalve> this music woolieSHOOK woolieSHOOK woolieSHOOK woolieSHOOK
[1:11:43] <+HerdenDerden> DO PEOPLE PLAY KI ON PC?
[1:11:45] <%Hacerous> i think it 11
[1:11:52] <Lolzer82> @HerdenDerden yup
[1:11:54] <+absolutexero11> Its combo limit or lesson 11
[1:11:54] <+tuchpi> @HerdenDerden I do :)
[1:11:56] <+slayabee> People play KI on PC
[1:11:58] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> @herdenderden Yes!
[1:11:59] <ArbyDMC> It's crossplay anyway
[1:12:04] <+tuchpi> ^
[1:12:22] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Enders are super important
[1:12:37] <ArbyDMC> Enders are you get your damage
[1:12:40] <seylumiue> Press buttons!
[1:12:41] <Lolzer82> The type of ender is also important, but that gets explained soon enough
[1:12:43] <%generalve> TRIPLE
[1:13:07] <Arek_1> Autos are follow-ups. Like Vega's wall dive into slash or Izuna Drop follow-ups.
[1:13:13] <@Menitta> yo KI
[1:13:30] <@Menitta> The best fighting game I'm terrible at
[1:13:30] <DavidDredd84> This is sick, I haven't touched this game in forever
[1:13:34] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Hey one question: Why does it seem like they increased the speed of Jago's Ultra with every season?
[1:13:56] <+slayabee> READ
[1:14:03] <Lolzer82> @L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N that's probably just your imagination
[1:14:06] <+slayabee> There you go lol
[1:14:10] <Keits> yeah we didn't
[1:14:25] <Keits> same speed as s1 launch day

[1:14:35] <Orbeii> let's go fighting love?
[1:14:37] <%Hacerous> beat their asses
[1:14:40] <Keits> they are musically timed and hard to change
[1:14:44] <Dragon_Batman> Throw em into the pool to learn to swim then
[1:14:47] <Solidnick18> fight go
[1:14:50] <artificiallynatural> I like how they just let you use whatever moves you wanted for this part of the tutorial. It really helped me internalize what to do and which moves did what
[1:14:50] <@Solidus_113> RASH
[1:14:51] <+TheBesteban> Crush them @WoolieVersus
[1:14:53] <twoto858> COMBO BREAKERS

[1:14:54] <+slayabee> Didn't even learn about Instinct
[1:14:54] <Keits> very overly complicated system
[1:14:55] <blue6sub6remnant6> Okay, now to see if Reggie picks Jago.

[1:59:17] <@Solidus_113> It's Keits going to get in there?
[1:59:20] <Solidnick18> gooo
[1:59:20] <@Solidus_113> is*
[1:59:32] <Solidnick18> lol
[1:59:35] <gunsrlove> SQUAD lol
[1:59:53] <BusterRepukken> is he picking someone
[1:59:54] <ArbyDMC> Why can't I find the lobby?
[1:59:56] <+TeethMuncher> It's lost knowledge
[1:59:56] <%yeknomlive> you're a squad now
[2:00:04] <Solidnick18> oh mira
[2:00:04] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:00:08] <Jetsfantasy> @Squdnate They can't read
[2:00:23] <ArbyDMC> How does one find the lobby
[2:00:23] <%yeknomlive> I bought this game because of mira and her jack of blades costume
[2:00:25] <%Irridium> @ArbyDMC it's 2 player only so you gotta get lucky when searching
[2:00:35] <BwdYeti> thunder has the sharingan? PogChamp
[2:00:41] <bear_breaker20> 1 day before welfare thunder skin LUL
[2:00:43] <ArbyDMC> Wow I do not like this lobby system
[2:00:58] <+tuchpi> Thunder can use Susano LUL
[2:01:01] <FullMetalSnorlax> It's not great
[2:01:07] <primaryfire> she really do be living in a society
[2:01:12] <+dtogo> Thunder looks like he just walked outta FOTNS
[2:01:16] <Dragon_Batman> Boo bop bee bo
[2:01:21] <@Solidus_113> Big risk Mira
[2:01:22] <ArbyDMC> I'm surprised it's like this
[2:01:29] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> @dtogo octoNa octoNi
[2:01:30] <FullMetalSnorlax> Netcode A+ Ranked mode A+ Lobbies C-
[2:01:41] <ArbyDMC> SF4 has better lobbies.
[2:01:48] <ArbyDMC> amh
[2:01:50] <%Hacerous> it use to be advantageous i think there was an OS with assist on
[2:01:57] <bear_breaker20> thunder left his good shirt at his exes* skin
[2:01:59] <%jinking79> what i missed
[2:02:10] <@Solidus_113> The downside is you get blown up by anyone who actually knows how to play the game
[2:02:15] <ArbyDMC> Ouch
[2:02:27] <BusterRepukken> COUNTER BREAKERRRR
[2:02:29] <BwdYeti> the only downside is sometimes you might get a move you didn't expect, but that only happens if you messed up an input anyway
[2:02:45] <Goldenwolf98> @ArbyDMC @FullMetalSnorlax you do realize if the lobby is only 2 people that means thats what Woolie set it to and not that their is not larger lobbies right?
[2:02:52] <gunsrlove> POOPA PEEPO
[2:02:53] <FullMetalSnorlax> I played competitively with auto comobo on, just because my thumbs would become sore from repetiitve circle motions
[2:02:56] <ArbyDMC> Yeah we know
[2:03:06] <ArbyDMC> But you don't get a list of lobbies
[2:03:12] <ArbyDMC> it just sends you into one
[2:03:27] <@Squdnate> cant back out
[2:03:28] <DracOmega64> YO KI PogChamp
[2:03:36] <%yeknomlive> ft 2 I guess. send them to losers
[2:03:41] <FullMetalSnorlax> @Goldenwolf98 I know that, there are other issues with the lobbies
[2:04:09] <ArbyDMC> Auto combos allow you to extend combos in DBFZ
[2:04:10] <BlackermanZX> One of the best themes in KI
[2:04:11] <faqmachine> air autocombo in dragon ball autotracks
[2:04:19] <@Solidus_113> SourPls
[2:04:24] <%jinking79> only way to back out is to quit out the app
[2:04:28] <@Solidus_113> LittleV on the guitar
[2:04:31] <Tha_Mik> SourPls
[2:04:33] <FullMetalSnorlax> @ArbyDMC those are completetly different auto combos
[2:04:40] <ArbyDMC> What?
[2:04:40] <%yeknomlive> swatcats op
[2:04:57] <laserbeaming> STILL going? You're insane Mr Woolzworth
[2:05:05] <BwdYeti> you can't tell, because the game doesn't judge
[2:05:13] <Dragon_Batman> He took an hour break in between
[2:05:20] <+slayabee> No it doesn't. And it doesn't matter.
[2:05:28] <FullMetalSnorlax> Auto combo in KI is just a input assist, in DBFZ it's a completely different move.
[2:05:35] <ArbyDMC> Yeah I know.
[2:05:37] <zayasu> succ Kreygasm
[2:05:45] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> s u c c
[2:05:47] <Datwiseguy> yo what's the lobby
[2:05:55] <ArbyDMC> But they brought up DBFZ and I was clarifying how people still use them in some way.
[2:06:17] <Dragon_Batman> Yea you would
[2:06:34] <ArbyDMC> Dammit
[2:06:35] <rheviel> too much power in the taunt button
[2:06:47] <Keits> the highest damage combos in KI are the easiest to perform AND the easiest to break. this is why combo assist doesn't provide a real advantage
[2:06:49] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Taunt is OP, please nerf
[2:07:03] <@Squdnate> I could have picked a safer character like Sadina, but I thought Mira would be fun
[2:07:04] <%yeknomlive> thanks keits
[2:07:05] <nothuzad> Keits coming in with the real knowledge :)
[2:07:05] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1207129758447939586?s=19
[2:07:07] <@Squdnate> I haven't played KI in months
[2:07:07] <Keits> most games have combos that get stronger as they get harder. KI does not
[2:07:19] <ArbyDMC> I keep trying to get in but it's just luck.
[2:07:23] <ArbyDMC> smh
[2:07:29] <Keits> Hard combos in KI are harder to break, but generally always deal less damage
[2:07:35] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Oh shit RAAM MonkaS
[2:07:47] <Keits> this also means that all combo types are used always. you must mix it up
[2:07:48] <Goldenwolf98> @WoolieVersus Why not just do exhibition if you only do 1 slot both ways its just a random search
[2:07:55] <Keits> if you are repetitive you will be broken
[2:08:11] <BwdYeti> such good game design
[2:08:13] <dking0000> TJ doesn‚Äôt get higher damage, the mix just gets more nutty with more advance play.
[2:08:18] <BwdYeti> YEYEYE RIP STREAM
[2:08:18] <+absolutexero11> Rip Stream
[2:08:20] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> Hey! it's Keits!
[2:08:24] <Solidnick18> crill storm
[2:08:38] <Jetsfantasy> Darude Crowstorm
[2:08:42] <laserbeaming> General Raam is cool. I have no idea who he is, I just know he's from Halo, but I like him
[2:08:46] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Grappler that blinds you
[2:08:56] <@Solidus_113> Raam is from Gears, not Halo
[2:08:56] <nothuzad> laserbeaming from gears fo war not halo :)
[2:08:57] <laserbeaming> I meant Geras
[2:08:59] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> @laserbeaming He's frok Gears...
[2:09:02] <Dragon_Batman> He is from Gears of War actually
[2:09:04] <laserbeaming> I always get confused
[2:09:07] <%Irridium> Geras is Mortal Kombat
[2:09:08] <+PapaHaunts> This music is exactly what I think of with these two characters
[2:09:08] <Solidnick18> good stuff
[2:09:10] <nothuzad> arbiter si from halo
[2:09:10] <jubejube56> General raam from minecraft
[2:09:10] <Keits> imo, repetitive confirms and combos and setplay are the enemy of fighting game design
[2:09:10] <%Irridium> LUL
[2:09:11] <laserbeaming> Gears*
[2:09:15] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> It's ok to get confused
[2:09:16] <+tuchpi> LUL
[2:09:20] <laserbeaming> It seems I can't even write today
[2:09:29] <Goldenwolf98> General Ram from Conker Kappa
[2:09:33] <@Solidus_113> MASTER HISAKO
[2:09:36] <@Solidus_113> FEAR
[2:09:38] <Dragon_Batman> It's fine
[2:09:42] <BlackermanZX> we all know Raam is from KH2
[2:09:51] <ArbyDMC> this lobby system can get bent
[2:09:54] <+slayabee> I wanna play doodSad
[2:09:56] <coreybom> OH FUCK HISAKO 50 WutFace
[2:09:56] <Keits> if everything has a real purpose players make choices instead of confirming into the optimal thing
[2:09:57] <%yeknomlive> Ii
[2:09:59] <dking0000> If Keits is still here, I don‚Äôt know how you managed to turn RAAM from big stab guy to one of the most interesting grapplers ever but massive props
[2:09:59] <ArbyDMC> I'm gettin real angy
[2:10:00] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Raam is from Bomberman 64 duh
[2:10:08] <rheviel> I thought that was an intentional mistake @laserbeaming lol
[2:10:11] <Keits> dking thanks
[2:10:17] <coreybom> REGGIES BOUT TO GET FUCKED
[2:10:25] <Dragon_Batman> Yeyeyeye HIsako
[2:10:27] <@Solidus_113> lvl 50 hisako player here
[2:10:30] <laserbeaming> @rheviel nope, honest, yet hilarious mistake
[2:10:36] <Goldenwolf98> Best female fighting game character
[2:10:46] <Keits> raam is basically sf4 geif with fang poison
[2:11:01] <Solidnick18> posses him
[2:11:10] <Keits> poison is more interesting on a grappler because you have to hit him to stop it and you don't want to be near him
[2:11:11] <%Irridium> god I wish that were me
[2:11:12] <FullMetalSnorlax> Her slashes are not a true block-string. You can jab her between slashes
[2:11:14] <@Solidus_113> do the stage ultra or the ultiamte
[2:11:17] <Keits> so you end up going to him
[2:11:19] <nothuzad> suck me :)
[2:11:27] <+OneGorillionDollars> you can jump the succ
[2:11:31] <dking0000> Curb Stomp otg ing mixups are so cool
[2:11:31] <rheviel> somebody's getting suuuuccc'd
[2:11:35] <+slayabee> Yeah seriously props to Keits and IG for creating some of the most interestingly designed FG characters
[2:11:52] <Keits> poison mechanic on fang isn't very interesting because you want to smother him anyway
[2:11:58] <+the22cstomp> props to keits and IG for making those characters fun AND viable
[2:12:14] <primaryfire> that bar is going in his pension
[2:12:16] <ArbyDMC> C'mon maaaaaaan
[2:12:19] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Does Raam have any 360 inputs?
[2:12:22] <%Wool> GREEN
[2:12:22] <+the22cstomp> no
[2:12:23] <%yeknomlive> voltron
[2:12:24] <FullMetalSnorlax> KI's graplers are so cool, IF ONLY WE HAD MORE OF THEM
[2:12:25] <Keits> no
[2:12:29] <+the22cstomp> his grab is qcb
[2:12:36] <nothuzad> ye mad props to you and the team Keits - I wish there would be a "remaster" of this for the next xbox generation
[2:12:47] <Keits> only b,f u,d and qcf and dp in this game
[2:12:50] <primaryfire> shadow jago is nuts
[2:12:54] <+slayabee> ^^^
[2:12:56] <Dragon_Batman> LUL
[2:13:04] <%Irridium> arby's theme is fuckin' ace
[2:13:04] <%jinking79> why isn't Woolie playin on Exhibition
[2:13:04] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Interesting, I've always been interested in grapplers but i'm terrible with 360 inputs
[2:13:07] <xiccy> @keits True but I thought the point with Fang was he had enough weird movement that it was supposed to be hard to touch him
[2:13:21] <Keits> d,u*
[2:13:25] <nothuzad> jinking79 woolz doesnt understand lobby systems :)
[2:13:27] <ArbyDMC> SANGHELIOS BABY
[2:13:40] <Keits> xiccy we've seen that doesn't work in practice for 4 seasons now
[2:13:49] <Datwiseguy> yo keits, what are your thoughts on u,d charge/ f,d charge
[2:13:57] <xiccy> @keits True
[2:13:57] <Datwiseguy> f,b
[2:14:07] <Keits> it's awkward
[2:14:07] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:14:08] <laserbeaming> Spinal is sick, Love that Skelly Boy
[2:14:12] <dking0000> Charge wouldn‚Äôt work for the pace of KI is how I always saw it
[2:14:20] <Keits> and results in many accidental inputs
[2:14:48] <Goldenwolf98> I cant even imagine playing TJ if he was a charge character LUL
[2:14:55] <dking0000> ^^^
[2:15:01] <Keits> charging is fine for this pace
[2:15:04] <Solidnick18> oh no
[2:15:14] <Jetsfantasy> You'd have to charge partition a lot
[2:15:24] <Keits> this game isn't wild fast, it just as a lot of decisions per second
[2:15:38] <coreybom> so Minh is bout to die as well
[2:15:41] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> I suppose charge motions wouldn't work because of the combo system, right?
[2:15:43] <@Solidus_113> yeah
[2:15:47] <%jinking79> oh good luck Minh
[2:15:49] <ArbyDMC> This is FOR FUN
[2:15:54] <randomness_yo> To bad Max isnt playing against you guys. That guy would love to have a reason to boot up KI
[2:15:58] <BlackermanZX> Oh so minh has chosen death
[2:16:13] <@Solidus_113> Master Shadow Jago
[2:16:13] <%yeknomlive> you guys see that fight of animals

[2:23:45] <Goldenwolf98> @randomness_yo but it wins hearts Kappa
[2:23:49] <randomness_yo> yes it does
[2:23:54] <jase__x> The lobby searching is pretty simple
[2:23:59] <dking0000> @froyuken I forgot there was an actual new Battletoads game and thought of the old meme
[2:24:08] <%Irridium> just gotta get lucky it seems
[2:24:13] <dj_jellocups> anyone know the lobby settings? I'm trying to get in
[2:24:19] <FullMetalSnorlax> Aww man, who will I play when I get in? I want to to show off Gargos and Kahn-ra, but I'm sooo rusty I don't even remember their inputs.
[2:24:28] <Froyuken> @dking0000 You mean that GameStop one? lol
[2:24:30] <jase__x> you have to set the lobby to Woolie's settings
[2:24:32] <Goldenwolf98> @jinking79 he should just be doing exhibition if hes just doing a 2 man lobby really LUL
[2:24:33] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Man remember when you couldn't break air combos?

[2:24:42] <dj_jellocups> thanks solidus
[2:24:54] <blue6sub6remnant6> @dking0000 We haven't gotten any news on the "new game" for like year. What if it's announced to kill the memes?
[2:24:54] <%Irridium> @jase__x I did that and I'm getting all kinds of lobbies that ain't him sadly
[2:24:59] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> No supreme pizza for you

[2:25:14] <%jinking79> @goldenwolf98 i know right

[2:25:17] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Yo you guys have Battletoads for the Nintendo Wii?

[2:25:25] <@Solidus_113> stage ultra is on the right side only
[2:25:28] <@Squdnate> Btw. I'm from Denmark, Woolie is Canadian. No noticable lag in the game we played at all. ROLLBACK IS SOO GUD
[2:25:30] <FullMetalSnorlax> If too manny people are searching lobbies, it puts you in as the host
[2:25:33] <jase__x> oh forgot the ultra
[2:25:39] <TomCrimson> well you can tell I havent played in forever LUL

[2:31:12] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Oh so Steam DOES have crossplay with Xbox... I didn't think it had
[2:31:13] <Guntanks_in_Space> and the connection was ACE
[2:31:13] <masterofzin> ok im ready to lose
[2:31:15] <blue6sub6remnant6> GGPO here to save fighting games and KI is the proof of concept.

[2:31:39] <Guntanks_in_Space> @L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N yea steam can crossplay with xbox live but ranked is separate i think
[2:31:39] <ArbyDMC> Rollback is incredible
[2:31:42] <%Dontwareitout> THE MIXUP
[2:31:42] <dking0000> Opener to Ender
[2:31:48] <ArbyDMC> My lobby settings are the same as Woolie's
[2:31:52] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Oh I see
[2:31:58] <Guntanks_in_Space> for every shitty SFV rollback story you have KI doing it PERFECTLY
[2:32:12] <dking0000> KI wins again
[2:32:15] <@Squdnate> I said I'm from Denmark, but that's close to Australia I guess haha. Also Max loves to bring up a match he played against a guy from Dubai with 0 lag
[2:32:17] <BwdYeti> thunder popping his instinct: tsukiyomi
[2:32:20] <FullMetalSnorlax> CAN YOU FEEL THE STORM?

[2:32:26] <TomCrimson> ayyyyyyyyy
[2:32:27] <@Squdnate> It's almost like Rollback is fucking good and everybody should be using it
[2:32:32] <gordieda20> LUL
[2:32:33] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Man I wish my computer didn't suck ass so I could play some KI

[2:33:26] <randomness_yo> Reggie talking shit too early lol
[2:33:33] <Jetsfantasy> Aganos master PogChamp
[2:33:42] <+smitty_werb_> Moving forward heals you @WoolieVersus
[2:33:43] <+ultrachibi> would you be open to doing another lobby in ki sometime in the near future? @WoolieVersus
[2:33:43] <Froyuken> Back to Rise?
[2:33:45] <@Solidus_113> LVL 50 OMEN
[2:33:45] <Guntanks_in_Space> yea jago not using instinct to heal up is s weird lol
[2:33:47] <@Solidus_113> AHHHHHHHHHH
[2:33:49] <Guntanks_in_Space> BRING ON THE BULLET HELL
[2:33:52] <%Irridium> oh this gonna be good
[2:33:54] <BwdYeti> the unstoppable omen
[2:33:55] <%shmupdogjoe> Did someone say the magic word?
[2:33:55] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> HOW
[2:33:57] <@Squdnate> Level 50 Omen... Time to FEAR
[2:33:58] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> That is a hard MonkaS
[2:33:58] <blue6sub6remnant6> It's time for RNG.
[2:34:00] <%ultrachibi> ultrachibi subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:34:07] <laserbeaming> Omen is weird
[2:34:10] <@Solidus_113> actual RNG
[2:34:13] <@Solidus_113> for reals
[2:34:13] <Jetsfantasy> SourPls
[2:34:14] <jubejube56> What if an item character but also edge?
[2:34:17] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Get your lube because otherwise its going to be painful
[2:34:18] <sappinmahbinyot> Rollback is amazing. I can play with people in south america on KoF 2002. I'm thinking that Rollback should also be implemented in non fighting games, like Warframe.
[2:34:19] <dking0000> How do you dodge someone‚Äôs fireballs when they have no idea where they‚Äôre gonna go?
[2:34:27] <sappinmahbinyot> SourPls
[2:34:28] <%BackwardCap> Omen is a Jago
[2:34:36] <%jinking79> get the 3 fireballs he wanted luck
[2:34:57] <candidateplays> Omen is Kage
[2:34:58] <@Solidus_113> Omen also gets 3 bars of meter, instead of the usual 2
[2:35:08] <dking0000> Hit the demon
[2:35:11] <%Dontwareitout> omen is a true oraoraoraora character lmao
[2:35:12] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> That fireball cross up
[2:35:14] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Omen is "another version of Jago" to put it simply
[2:35:16] <Dragon_Batman> DAyum
[2:35:19] <ArbyDMC> I don't play this game enough.
[2:35:23] <Goldenwolf98> Omen is Faust Kappa
[2:35:23] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:35:24] <%jinking79> r we gonna see tye Grab
[2:35:41] <artificiallynatural> A shame that rollback is still being debated for japanese fighting games. I feel like the industry won't adapt until capcom comes out with a legit good fighting game with rollback and that's gonna be waiting for a while
[2:35:49] <sappinmahbinyot> How are these characters so unique? Oh my lord, it's awesome.
[2:35:51] <%mistersups> Omen is Hero
[2:35:56] <TomCrimson> @ArbyDMC hol up
[2:35:57] <laserbeaming> 5 different colored Omens might make a good Sentai Team
[2:36:02] <ArbyDMC> I wonder if rollback would've saved Marvel Infinite
[2:36:08] <artificiallynatural> rollback is in infinite
[2:36:09] <nothuzad> artificiallynatural GG passing up on GGPO now that it has been pushed int heir feedback paper would be so miserable
[2:36:15] <Dragon_Batman> It had great online
[2:36:17] <ArbyDMC> Oh is it actually good rollback
[2:36:21] <+slayabee> You can charge fireballs with Jago @woolieversus
[2:36:25] <artificiallynatural> yes, it's a huge improvement over SFV
[2:36:28] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Rollback doesn't save games, unfortunately
[2:36:36] <@Squdnate> You gotta remember that rollback also needs to be done correctly. Because SF5 has rollback, but it's so poorly done
[2:36:43] <@Squdnate> also ULTRA HOIPE
[2:36:45] <+absolutexero11> PogChamp
[2:36:46] <Dragon_Batman> The visuals and lack of a roster to grab people is part of what did it
[2:36:46] <BwdYeti> good enough
[2:36:47] <nothuzad> L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N it doesnt save games but ti saves communities
[2:36:47] <%shmupdogjoe> ULTRAAAAAAA

[2:38:05] <laserbeaming> Well, I'm off to sleep. It's been fun to watch this. Gonna redownload KI first thing tomorrow
[2:38:08] <%Hacerous> only on the Windows 10 version
[2:38:14] <artificiallynatural> it bastion PogChamp
[2:38:14] <dking0000> The real bullet hell begins now
[2:38:16] <%Hacerous> you can transfer
[2:38:20] <%jinking79> u could use the Windows 10 ver
[2:38:31] <candidateplays> Isn't GFWL dead?
[2:38:34] <@Squdnate> I play on the Windows 10 bersion
[2:38:35] <%FrostedZaibatsu> Does the steam version work with xbox?
[2:38:41] <NicholasOsen_> win10 verison of KI is the best verison
[2:38:42] <BwdYeti> win10 thing isn't GFWL
[2:38:45] <artificiallynatural> all versions have crossplay no?
[2:38:48] <dking0000> Not on ranked but test with everything else
[2:38:49] <%Irridium> @FrostedZaibatsu yep
[2:38:49] <@Squdnate> Yes
[2:38:51] <%shmupdogjoe> lets see those danmakus, Hellfire_Star!
[2:38:55] <@Solidus_113> Yeah, on the Windows Store/GamePass version you just login to your Xbox account and it'll have the save
[2:39:10] <@Squdnate> Crossplay is segmented to PC and Xbox. No matter where you buy KI on PC from
[2:39:36] <dking0000> Xbox Live uses a different leaderboard system than Steam so you won‚Äôt be able to ranked play against Xbox Players
[2:39:37] <ArbyDMC> How do you break Shadow moves
[2:39:39] <artificiallynatural> my only worry getting KI would be if I could run the online on my shitty laptop
[2:39:53] <Froyuken> KIIIING Combo.
[2:40:01] <dking0000> 123 in Rythm with the shadow move
[2:40:13] <%Irridium> Yeah this was sadly before they let you keep saves between platforms. Gears 5 and Halo Reach both let you transfer saves between versions since you have to sign into your XBL tag for PC
[2:40:14] <laserbeaming> there's a really nice benchmark for that @artificiallynatural
[2:40:22] <ArbyDMC> One two three with every set of buttons?
[2:40:26] <laserbeaming> in-game benchmark
[2:40:28] <%jinking79> to bad Ki couldn't get Mods
[2:40:31] <dking0000> Mediums
[2:40:42] <ArbyDMC> k
[2:40:43] <dking0000> 3 mediums amongst the five shadow hits
[2:40:53] <+tuchpi> LUL
[2:40:58] <artificiallynatural> @laserbeaming yeah, I tried out the demo and tested the online but my computer couldn't handle it

[3:07:28] <FullMetalSnorlax> No waifu Calibur is better
[3:07:29] <@Menitta> I wish this version of her theme was on Spotify
[3:07:34] <Solidnick18> lame it out

[3:07:52] <+absolutexero11> BIRB
[3:07:53] <Captain_Aham> anything Mick Gordan touches has my immediate attention
[3:07:54] <Solidnick18> yeee

[3:10:17] <+AsslessChapsVEVO> woolie vs brennan
[3:10:25] <%shmupdogjoe> I see. The way to use a bow and arrow in battle is get right in the other guy's face. That way you can't miss and you can also use the arrows for combo
[3:10:28] <FullMetalSnorlax> Fulgore has the same moove, because they have history together

[3:26:44] <%Irridium> evil looking neutral
[3:26:51] <BwdYeti> compared to gargos basically no one is evil
[3:27:04] <+CrackedPipe457> Chaotic neutral?
[3:27:09] <@Menitta> Kan Ra would totally barf in a stranger's purse

[3:28:49] <%drefizz> don't hate me
[3:28:51] <%shmupdogjoe> there is something fundamentally *wrong* about a fighting game where a werewolf isn't the one weilding nunchucks. Just saying
[3:28:58] <Tntwelve> no lol
[3:29:20] <%drefizz> @shmupdogjoe I get your reference
[3:29:33] <+absolutexero11> John Talbain
[3:29:39] <Captain_Aham> wooo saw, something something jago, something something kanwa, something something jago
[3:29:48] <primaryfire> the white part of the healthbar gets cashed in when you end combos properly
[3:30:07] <jubejube56> Seriously why did they think John Talbain needed nunchucks?
[3:30:16] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> There's something fundamentally wrong about a game where the protagonist doesn't turn into a dragon halfway through the fight and combos you to death
[3:30:17] <jubejube56> Were nunchucks just cool with kids?
[3:30:19] <guymontag0> It‚Äôs cool
[3:30:24] <Datwiseguy> ggs zinmaster
[3:30:27] <@Solidus_113> WOOOOO

[3:33:03] <RenFuuma> that's irritating

[3:34:09] <sappinmahbinyot> rude
[3:34:10] <+absolutexero11> Well get out of the soup aisle!
[3:34:16] <Dragon_Batman> The Steal a soul match was really good
[3:34:16] <+TheBesteban> He tried to steal Becky Lynch's soul one time
[3:34:19] <+TheBesteban> It was scary
[3:34:19] <guymontag0> @jinking79 Couldn‚Äôt Eyedol Kill himself with the self punch?
[3:34:21] <Guntanks_in_Space> Ric Flair overcame his surgery by a big Soulnado
[3:34:25] <+RichHoboInVegas> Have we seen Eyedol yet?
[3:34:31] <+absolutexero11> No eyedol
[3:34:34] <sappinmahbinyot> Well, now we have.

[3:34:44] <%drefizz> Eyedol time Pog
[3:34:50] <+Aeriqui> tryna get in
[3:34:50] <BwdYeti> no soul transfer is the biggest missed opportunity
[3:34:54] <%jinking79> @guymontag0 i've never seen that sounds fun
[3:35:02] <Guntanks_in_Space> Bork Laser

[3:35:42] <rheviel> big boi
[3:35:59] <@Solidus_113> check that eyedol meter
[3:36:08] <sappinmahbinyot> This is how KoF girls seem to Ralf and Clark in KoF 13.
[3:36:11] <+absolutexero11> Eyedols alternate costumes are really good
[3:36:41] <%jinking79> IG made Eyedol really cool
[3:36:52] <%jinking79> even his Classic
[3:36:55] <sappinmahbinyot> But in all honesty fighting games need more huge charcters
[3:37:12] <@Solidus_113> we have plenty of huge characters
[3:37:13] <+absolutexero11> Big Bois are always welcome
[3:37:19] <candidateplays> Eyedol switches at random
[3:37:27] <sappinmahbinyot> big bois are fuckin awesome
[3:37:31] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Guilty Gear 2020 needs accurate-size Justice as a playable character
[3:37:35] <+absolutexero11> He's more likely to switch when you use more special moves
[3:37:41] <jubejube56> Switches randomly after using a special move I believe

[3:51:02] <Tntwelve> choo choo
[3:51:18] <@Solidus_113> It's not
[3:51:21] <@Solidus_113> sadly
[3:51:50] <PSIRockOmega> Never did I think I'd ever see Rash and the Arbiter in the same video game.
[3:51:53] <sappinmahbinyot> Why is this game's guest roster so good?
[3:52:03] <@Solidus_113> it's his Halo shields
[3:52:09] <CryptusMaximus> Keith David as a fighting game guest isnt until next March.
[3:52:34] <Dragon_Batman> LUL
[3:52:38] <guymontag0> Because they are off the wall. They could‚Äôve easily just gotten Master Chief and Marcus Fenix but they went with some weirdos instead
[3:52:43] <BwdYeti> you have to use a super or instinct to get shields
[3:52:45] <sappinmahbinyot> Dear god I forgot how far awayt Spawn is
[3:52:47] <sappinmahbinyot> why did you ahve to remind me?
[3:52:54] <+the22cstomp> because IG is good at choosing everything
[3:53:04] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Marcus Fenix would honestly be weirder tbh
[3:53:06] <%yeknomlive> yes dude
[3:53:08] <primaryfire> he has to activate the shields by spending 1 bar

[4:07:45] <%damienlunas> Woolie have you heard the news of "Fight of Animals: Legend of the Strongest Creature" the hot new fighting game
[4:08:38] <%damienlunas> With such characters as Magic Squirrel and Muscle Beluga
[4:09:09] <rheviel> FoA:LotSC you say
[4:09:46] <artificiallynatural> Muscle Beluga looks like something straight out of my nightmares
[4:09:50] <StarvingPenguinGod> PogChamp
[4:09:53] <%damienlunas> According to a tweet it has functional rollback netcode
[4:10:26] <primaryfire> oh wow
[4:10:28] <+Cerberus_NV> Benny PogChamp
[4:10:30] <%shmupdogjoe> Between that and Fighting Herds, are we at a full 50% of games with rollback netcode being animal-based?
[4:10:37] <@Solidus_113> Reminder Max made official trailers for this game
[4:10:37] <FortuneEX> doodBenny
[4:10:38] <%yeknomlive> doodBenny
[4:10:38] <%drefizz> max did work on the game
[4:10:39] <artificiallynatural> The cat is the worst
[4:10:46] <DedlokPM> doodBenny doodBenny2 doodBenny3
[4:10:56] <SpookyBeef7> I think Max helped edit the trailers?
[4:11:04] <Tntwelve> Benny boy!
[4:11:21] <%yeknomlive> he made them
[4:11:22] <primaryfire> banger alert
[4:11:34] <zenith0111> So he was a grunt employee for the game? LUL
[4:11:53] <SpookyBeef7> More like a freelancer they hired.
[4:11:54] <+tuchpi> he was in charge of the story
[4:12:03] <Dragon_Batman> He worked with Mick Gordon on the pacing of them too
[4:12:06] <%FrostedZaibatsu> So, Max got into a car accident today. If you didnt hear
[4:12:15] <SpookyBeef7> Shit, is he okay?!
[4:12:15] <%yeknomlive> thank god they're both ok
[4:12:20] <%yeknomlive> him and jj are ok
[4:12:21] <primaryfire> he's fine
[4:12:25] <Dragon_Batman> Luckily yea they seem to be ok
[4:12:28] <%yeknomlive> car's wrecked tho
[4:12:46] <primaryfire> that ain't fine
[4:12:48] <zenith0111> That's why you buy the good cars
[4:12:52] <guymontag0> It was cause of a truck merging, right? Glad they‚Äôre okay.
[4:12:55] <%damienlunas> Aganos reminds me of Gold Lightan from TvC. I wrecked with Gold Lightan except for the fact that Tekkaman Blade is an actual 9-1 matchup against him.
[4:12:55] <zenith0111> You live at least
[4:13:16] <SpookyBeef7> Of course it was a truck driver. They literally give no shits.
[4:13:18] <Tntwelve> What?
[4:13:41] <fatally_furious> @spookybeef7 they're busy reconnecting america 4Head

[4:16:12] <fatally_furious> what ever happened to the doodBenny colors
[4:16:15] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Of course it is @damienlunas
[4:16:19] <zenith0111> @damienlunas No such things as bad publicity when you're starting out LUL
[4:16:31] <guymontag0> I feel bad for Freddy. Of all the times he could have died, it had to be the time he had that ugly sweater on.
[4:16:55] <Dragon_Batman> LUL
[4:17:48] <fatally_furious> man, you know you've created a monster when they surpass Ino in mixups

[4:19:00] <%drefizz> I've had someone ultra on me for a straight 10 minutes with hisako
[4:19:04] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Hey by the way guys, if you do the wallsplat ender, it already puts you into position for a crossup for some characters, so you can do some sick resets @woolieversus
[4:19:24] <%shmupdogjoe> I miss the days when you could just be evil without needing to have a traumatic origin story

[4:23:03] <%shmupdogjoe> Thanks to the power of the internet, Timmy doesn't actually have any friends. Maybe he'll grow out of it before he's 30
[4:23:22] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Ok this hits a bit too close to home
[4:23:23] <zenith0111> Chats projecting their own life problems LUL

[4:23:40] <rheviel> calling me out
[4:23:42] <boski_szumi> who's Timmy?
[4:23:55] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> You dont wanna know whos Timmy
[4:23:56] <%shmupdogjoe> He's teh boy assistant from a science show on the old sitcom Dinosaurs
[4:23:58] <artificiallynatural> Instead of making friends, Timmy can threaten to feed if he doesn't get mid.
[4:24:07] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> LUL
[4:24:07] <%shmupdogjoe> The classic line was, "We need another Timmy!"
[4:24:12] <Dragon_Batman> I'm shure there is someone named timmy among his followers
[4:24:23] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Timmy is a war criminal
[4:24:34] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Wanted in more than 7 countries
[4:24:43] <artificiallynatural> JAPAN PLEASE
[4:24:45] <Dragon_Batman> What the hell was MGS 4's line, War never changes?
[4:24:50] <primaryfire> timmy brews white phosphorous in his spare time
[4:24:53] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> But through the power of the internet
[4:24:58] <rheviel> This was a great game session, it should always be this good.
[4:24:58] <blue6sub6remnant6> Japan continues to only care about Japan.
[4:25:00] <+eanscrale> GGPNO
[4:25:02] <artificiallynatural> MGS4 was War has changed. War never changes is Fallout
[4:25:08] <Dragon_Batman> Aaah
[4:25:12] <fatally_furious> @artificiallynatural ^
[4:25:15] <+Superbro64> you got to answer with your wallet I suppose
[4:25:23] <artificiallynatural> with straaaaands
[4:25:26] <+tuchpi> GGPO is Chiral
[4:25:30] <zenith0111> Rollback is really complicated from everything I researched.
[4:25:32] <BwdYeti> create a chiral network for maximum netcode
[4:25:37] <Dragon_Batman> We need a cut of GGPO into different scenes in Death Stranding
[4:25:41] <boski_szumi> so Timmy is not a person but some abstract idea about person that represent some collection of behaviors ?
[4:25:41] <+eanscrale> You could say it's what we're strIVing for.
[4:25:48] <zenith0111> MVCI probably looked that bad so the netcode could handle the graphics...
[4:25:48] <artificiallynatural> but other people have figured out rollback already so you just need to implement it
[4:25:49] <@Solidus_113> Also Crossplay
[4:25:49] <+Superbro64> rollback is not very complicated
[4:25:53] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> GGPJust buy Guilty Gear losers
[4:25:56] <lujme> "japan wanta connect japan. i guess everything else too idk"
[4:26:01] <zenith0111> Graphics are the biggest problems
[4:26:08] <%damienlunas> You need to buy Fight of Animals to show Japan that you want fighting games with Rollback Netcode FrankerZ
[4:26:09] <%yeknomlive> are we the homodemons
[4:26:21] <randomness_yo> good night!
[4:26:24] <%shmupdogjoe> UNO?
[4:26:26] <+Superbro64> as keits said, putting netcode in your game isnt easy, so you might as well do the next step and put rollback in
[4:26:26] <Dragon_Batman> Good stuff, Bye guys
[4:26:27] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> @zenith0111 What are you talking about?

[4:27:26] <%shmupdogjoe> Netherrealm doesn't put out five fighting games in a year tho
[4:27:37] <%shmupdogjoe> but for real rollback is very important for fight games future
[4:27:39] <+MrRgrs> man this is my favorite of their videos too
[4:27:48] <fatally_furious> @shmupdogjoe neither does any other fighting game dev
[4:28:03] <rheviel> Kreygasm
[4:28:12] <zenith0111> SFV and Tekken 7 technically have rollback netcode.

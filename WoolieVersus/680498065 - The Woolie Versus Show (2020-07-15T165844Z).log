[0:06:15] <%Solidnick18> SourPls SourPls
[0:06:18] <+payterodactyl> halo 2 legendary run?
[0:06:20] <kikoeru_san> for story it's 2
[0:06:27] <halfmasks> I cant believe Woolie NTR'd Pat twice on a sponsor
[0:06:31] <Ardyn_1zunia> "There are those who said this day would never come. What are they to say now?"
[0:06:31] <armchairmaster_> Wait, are those new emotes @solidnick18 ?
[0:06:33] <marisot_lemonade> halo 2 heroic run
[0:06:34] <%Wouldz> all my friends that I used to play Halo with are cowards and won't get the MCC
[0:06:36] <REGNIERx> And ODST JUST for the music
[0:06:47] <kikoeru_san> but like Halo 3 was THE online experience back in the day
[0:06:55] <+R0bobot> Hate the Prophet of truth's VA change in Halo 3.
[0:06:55] <kikoeru_san> but woolie won't see that
[0:06:57] <OverlordLuna> YEYEYE
[0:06:58] <%eggypigeon> eggypigeon subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! woolieSPICE John Halo Space Marine
[0:06:58] <%gatorafan> I mean, Pat got that TLoU2 code, so it's at the very least 2-1 so far.
[0:06:58] <leroyslammin> All this Kotor art is making me nostalgic.
[0:07:05] <MrBorisMakarov> MrBorisMakarov subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! Not much to say, cheers to ya both
[0:07:06] <halfmasks> I just replayed ODST, i forgot how much of a dick _that_ guy was
[0:07:09] <Ardyn_1zunia> Yeah I like Truth 2 VA over 3
[0:07:23] <%BisoromiBear> BURANDON
[0:07:23] <%Irridium> @kikoeru_san and before that, it was Halo 2. Kinda nuts how both dominated Xbox Live for so long
[0:07:28] <Ardyn_1zunia> Prophet of Truth's VA in 3 is Zod from Superman. He's not a very good VA
[0:07:31] <halfmasks> wont say names cause i dont wanna ruin it for woolie
[0:07:38] <kikoeru_san> they were Xbox live
[0:07:49] <%gatorafan> Also, Pat got the code right after the Podcast, so that was a mini ntr
[0:07:49] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:07:53] <kikoeru_san> why did you get Xbox live back when
[0:07:54] <halfmasks> im still a bit sad knowing that Halo 3 didnt get the Blur treatment
[0:07:59] <kikoeru_san> mfing halo
[0:07:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i just started 3 yesterday (first time playing it) and so far 2 feels way more.... intense. like, in 2 you're jumping into an AT AT, playing as arbiter, and more crazy stuff. in 3, so far, you just walk around a forest area and similar boring areas. idk, hope it picks up
[0:08:04] <torres_kun> Yo, what song is this??
[0:08:07] <leroyslammin> Halo 3 multiplayer is just beautiful chaos.
[0:08:10] <+R0bobot> Truth in 3 is okay, but it just doesn't have same cadence and manipulative tone that Truth in 2 does.
[0:08:16] <hereiam345> @halfmasks I was playing yesterday, yeh it's a little disappointing
[0:08:16] <armchairmaster_> Its a jam squizxyDongers
[0:08:20] <DianaTheAscian> song?
[0:08:22] <%brachydios777> This song do be bopping
[0:08:23] <kikoeru_san> 4 BR and you dead thems was the rules
[0:08:24] <%DomunDomunDomun> Truth in 3 is Terrence Stamp
[0:08:26] <%BisoromiBear> Gungrave ED
[0:08:29] <leroyslammin> Truth in 3 pretty much snapped mentally right?
[0:08:30] <Ardyn_1zunia> Truth in 3 turns into a big stupid ham
[0:08:30] <%DomunDomunDomun> aka General Zod
[0:08:30] <hereiam345> @halfmasks But I still like the cutscene upgrade, even though its minimal for the engine
[0:08:35] <torres_kun> Thanks!
[0:08:41] <Lieutenant_America> Truth's VA in 2 is smart enough to hide the fact that he's just as stupid in 2
[0:08:42] <%brachydios777> I think this is a SourPls
[0:08:56] <Lieutenant_America> Seriously he makes some dumb decisions in 2
[0:09:05] <%Wouldz> omg that mario art hahahaha
[0:09:14] <%Solidnick18> SourPls
[0:09:16] <Lieutenant_America> But he SOUNDS like a mastermind
[0:09:23] <Ardyn_1zunia> Don't read the books which say that Truth knew all along what the Halos really did. It completely breaks the lore
[0:09:27] <+TheShisno> Well, that's the Covenant in a nutshell
[0:09:27] <%brachydios777> @lieutenant_america Watch the spoilers for the uninitiated
[0:09:29] <%DappercatEsquire> Finished BNA last night, it was pretty good, not amazing though
[0:09:30] <+R0bobot> he does, but he makes it seem like they are smart decisions, which is important for truth as a character.
[0:09:32] <Ardyn_1zunia> He's big for suicide
[0:09:33] <%Solidnick18> woolieSPICE woolieSPICE woolieSPICE
[0:09:36] <halfmasks> yeah Truth in 2 vs 3 is a full 180
[0:09:40] <+voids_raider> but that spartan 2 backstory tho
[0:09:45] <DragonicProphet> Truth in 3 turns from an interesting calculated villain to cartoon imo
[0:09:46] <buster7800> Truth managed to single handedly split the covenant in half
[0:09:47] <%subjectg> i would argue that they only look dumb in hindsight now that we know the whole picture
[0:09:48] <Vital_Ire> *LETSFUCKINGGO*
[0:09:49] <thetransagenda> truth is basically a televangelist tho
[0:09:51] <DSD24> Wow that Fann Y Pak art
[0:09:55] <slatersev> Truth was leaving when he fired the rings
[0:09:59] <%SteinsApprentice> the pre-show music on point as always
[0:09:59] <slatersev> it doesnt break the lore
[0:09:59] <VidulaSaix> DUE RECOMPENSE

[0:10:06] <MrBorisMakarov> SourPls
[0:10:06] <%Solidnick18> SourPls
[0:10:09] <%krispen_wa> Truth in 2 says bullshit. truth in 3 believes in his bullshit
[0:10:10] <%GeneralSCPatton> What is this banger?
[0:10:10] <+EdenOfSecondAccount> that fucking ahegao face is horrorfying

[0:10:18] <thetransagenda> i dont think truth coudlve ran from the rings
[0:10:21] <MrBorisMakarov> Due Recompense @generalscpatton
[0:10:24] <%HaloPlayerNamedJohn> Ive been playing Halo 3 multiplayer and I hope they get that 360 hit detection
[0:10:24] <%gatorafan> Woolie's pre stream is a show of it's own SourPls
[0:10:25] <halfmasks> the weapon roster expands so much i have a feeling woolie wont get to try all of them
[0:10:26] <VidulaSaix> Do Wreckem Pants
[0:10:27] <thetransagenda> lets be careful with spoilers in chat tho!

[0:10:39] <kikoeru_san> yo what is the name of this remix
[0:10:43] <hereiam345> @Wouldz Like us all
[0:10:47] <Lieutenant_America> There was no sensible reason for Truth in 2 to make the move he did, plain and simple
[0:10:52] <%Solidnick18> it's from astral chain
[0:11:03] <Lieutenant_America> He didn't "get" stupid in 3
[0:11:03] <+CyanDeadEye> Man, I just moved and my copy of MCC is stuck somewhere in transit
[0:11:04] <DSD24> I'm pretty sure this is Due Recompense
[0:11:08] <%AkumaMatataX_X> Due Recompense??
[0:11:09] <leroyslammin> I honestly hope they try the multiplayer out sometime. I know they won't, but still.
[0:11:10] <%falconcrunchv2> I'm pretty sure a terminal talks about them knowing all along as well
[0:11:12] <torres_kun> Fem WoolieVersus makes me confused
[0:11:18] <%AkumaMatataX_X> @dsd24 yes it is
[0:11:20] <+CyanDeadEye> Been having the urge to play it so bad because of Woolie
[0:11:22] <slatersev> They knew about Humanity
[0:11:23] <MrBorisMakarov> ye this is Due Recompense from ff7r
[0:11:24] <+jojothegod125> if woolie starts playing halo 3 he should watch all the incredible trailers and extra content for the game
[0:11:25] <Ardyn_1zunia> The book is Contact Harvest
[0:11:27] <halfmasks> @torres_kun howd you feel about SFV Seth?
[0:11:29] <%shutupandjam3465> What did truth do?
[0:11:34] <slatersev> npt specifically what the rings do
[0:11:39] <%subjectg> It was a power move, that’s reason enough, and perhaps there was more, but we dunno
[0:11:41] <+R0bobot> I'm not even reallt talking about truth as a character. I just liked is VA in 2 way more. I wish Wincott didn't decline coming back in 3.
[0:11:45] <MrBorisMakarov> SourPls
[0:11:47] <halfmasks> no plot spoilers, woolie might be reading the chat

[0:11:59] <armchairmaster_> I just want Woolie to experience the magic that is sticking a Grunt with a grenade again
[0:12:02] <Ardyn_1zunia> A forerunner AI told the three prophets what the Halos did and they covered it up. THey all knew
[0:12:11] <%Solidnick18> woolieMIHNMAX
[0:12:13] <+maenos2> God I know this song from somewhere what is it...
[0:12:13] <Lieutenant_America> Oh his VA in 2 is absolutely better. But people confuse his VAs charisma for his own character
[0:12:20] <+Punch_kun> how long until woolie is collabing on hololive streams?
[0:12:21] <torres_kun> @halfmasks very confused, why is he a woman? I haven’t played SFV
[0:12:22] <+R0bobot> ye
[0:12:24] <slatersev> Bias told them that humanity were the reclaimers
[0:12:25] <buster7800> @shutupandjam3465 split the covenant in half with his elite genocide just because of paranoia
[0:12:29] <DragonicProphet> Do they have plans to play reach and ODST in the future ?
[0:12:30] <slatersev> not what the rings did
[0:12:30] <+R0bobot> @Lieutenant_America ye

[0:12:53] <%Wouldz> yoooo this song slaps
[0:12:54] <+maenos2> @shutupandjam3465 that's it thanks! I had this fucking song in my dreams for a week too.
[0:12:54] <leroyslammin> ODSTizzle
[0:12:56] <%krispen_wa> why does this sound like some hotline miami music
[0:12:57] <+Kindan55> they should at least play the bungie games
[0:13:00] <halfmasks> @kikoeru_san they have to STOP at reach
[0:13:05] <DSD24> Is Reach on PC?
[0:13:06] <kikoeru_san> exactly
[0:13:10] <%Irridium> @DSD24 yes
[0:13:13] <%Will9099> @DSD24 ye
[0:13:13] <+chunkyfranku> yes
[0:13:14] <leroyslammin> Immediately stop at Reach.
[0:13:17] <MrBorisMakarov> when does odst come to mcc
[0:13:19] <kikoeru_san> reach was the first they put out
[0:13:23] <%shutupandjam3465> @buster7800 well, to be honest, noting in the games tell us the propets are very smart....
[0:13:24] <%brachydios777> Is odst launching with 3 on pc or later?
[0:13:24] <halfmasks> you cant top the ending of reach IMO
[0:13:26] <armchairmaster_> It's a good thing Seth took Juri's form, cause DAMN did he pick best crazy waifu.
[0:13:27] <DSD24> I always wanted to play Reach but I never got to
[0:13:28] <@Menitta> isnt 4 still only on 360
[0:13:28] <Catpurrple> ODST comes next, dunno when though
[0:13:28] <+chunkyfranku> by the end of the summer
[0:13:32] <halfmasks> no spoilers but its STRONG
[0:13:34] <DinoBear_7> Reach would be fun, with challenges Woolie could level up a few times and get a taste of the customization
[0:13:34] <NotHereToStream> A O E
[0:13:35] <DSD24> COMP
[0:13:35] <torres_kun> @irridium hmm...I don’t know much about SF, so forgive me haha, I’ve always known him as a man

[0:28:04] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> @ghoulishcripple They did it because they're pieces of shit really, they did it before anyone even criticized them, it's the same right winger brainrot that always make things hard.

[0:29:06] <%Ancopro> oblivion is my fav for broken shit
[0:29:07] <%Irridium> if you get the PC version of Morrowind get the GoG version because steam version doesn't play nice with mods without mucking with files

[0:29:09] <kikoeru_san> Morrowind makes you write shit down
[0:29:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> I'd play with OpenMW. It's an open source hyper patched engine.
[0:29:11] <ghoulishcripple> @newandtastysixthhouse that thought process of calling it "rightwingbrainrot" is part of the problem. these people a lot of them are scared of conspiracy theories they trust. you calling them demeaning names only furthers their belief you are the enemy
[0:29:12] <Catpurrple> It's a hard sell if you go in without understanding the systems, it's SO easy to get fucking pissed off when you see your sword mesh clip through an enemy and do no damage because of the dice rolling.

[0:41:33] <%FallenAngelZelos> I had a blast with ME3 multiplayer
[0:41:33] <%Solidnick18> lol
[0:41:34] <+maenos2> mass effect multiplayer was far better than it deserved to be
[0:41:35] <+superb_superbia> As many issues as I have with ME3 the multiplayer was great
[0:41:35] <SnakeVash> Metal
[0:41:35] <%shadowsofpain> except it was a good multiplayer mode though
[0:41:36] <thebalticguy1> ME3 HAD BADASS MULTIPLAYER

[0:41:44] <DesertPenguin> It's simple, yet effective
[0:41:44] <%Greylander> I loved ME3's multplayer
[0:41:45] <+GreenCMD> ME3 multiplayer is the ultimate pleb filter

[0:41:53] <CiaraRoses> Horny af
[0:41:57] <kikoeru_san> they really like that chord
[0:41:57] <%Slimshazbot> I hated the idea of ME3 having multiplayer, but I probably played more of the MP than I did the rest of ME3

[0:46:35] <armchairmaster_> Everyone confimed wrong
[0:46:37] <%mechslayer71> It’s really sad that being a fucking retard is now a political stance that can be used to identify someone’s political stance with near 100% accuracy
[0:46:38] <SnakeVash> Don't blame the people of the past. Romans used to play with uranium since they didn't know what it was.

[0:53:44] <zamzoph> @DasFreekman So that's what they mean by The Horned Rat...
[0:53:44] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> @Cleverpup I really hope so, ODST is rad
[0:53:45] <Depthcharge2030> 2 Players who needs marines anyway
[0:53:47] <%subjectg> “Hehe, it’s not Christmas!”
[0:53:50] <+yeeter_baelish> me3 multiplayer was good
[0:53:53] <$QueequegTheater> V the Spoiler Cop
[0:53:55] <%brachydios777> Always give your rocket if there is one left
[0:53:56] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> ME3 MP was legit somehow
[0:54:01] <mdkcde> Mass Effect 3 multiplayer wasn't worth the whole package
[0:54:02] <+Karkatstoaster> Alright dipshit idiot noob question. How long does a subscription last? Is it just one month then you need to resub? Or is it longer?
[0:54:04] <$QueequegTheater> THANE IS A GAY PROTHEAN FROG
[0:54:04] <DSD24> Playing a Krogan was hype as fuck
[0:54:08] <%kyh9> No, 3
[0:54:08] <Halospaz117> Started in 3
[0:54:08] <%BisoromiBear> Don't worry, Pat already spoiled everything
[0:54:09] <%eggypigeon> Get down mister Woolie spoilers
[0:54:10] <+BigBlackBankai> 3 was first
[0:54:10] <Catpurrple> It's optimal play, but then again it's kinda hard to keep your marines alive long enough to make it worth it, at least heroic and up
[0:54:10] <%DesDavis> ME3 only
[0:54:12] <%kyh9> It started in three
[0:54:12] <mdkcde> No
[0:54:13] <DSD24> Remember the Warhammer Krogan!?
[0:54:13] <%memequisition> 2 didn't have multiplater
[0:54:13] <%Firststrike_OW> Started in ME3
[0:54:13] <alrobot2014> 2 didn't have multiplayer
[0:54:13] <$Rumbutt> ME3 MP was the first, none in 2
[0:54:13] <%Slimshazbot> just 3
[0:54:14] <derap41> What wasn't good was the loot boxes
[0:54:16] <CoffeeShopA> nay
[0:54:16] <letshavecakes> No
[0:54:17] <Sp3ctre48> No it was just ME3
[0:54:17] <%kyh9> No
[0:54:17] <startstoprepeat> started in 3, got way worse in andromeda
[0:54:17] <+OranHexthief> ME3 was the first one
[0:54:19] <%Chatterbox1991> no
[0:54:20] <SnakeVash> If this was Legendary, I'd suggest Brr with plasma pistol. But it's not.
[0:54:23] <minovsky_0079> 3 and Andromeda
[0:54:24] <derap41> just 3
[0:54:26] <%memequisition> ME3 came out in 2012
[0:54:27] <ralphfromdk> no, it started in 3, that's when they tried to tie it in to how well you would do in singleplayer
[0:54:28] <%DesDavis> remember ONLINE PASSES?
[0:54:30] <slix3431> WOOLIE is playing the Halos!
[0:54:30] <LiVeBoOsTeR3> Only 3

[0:56:29] <SnakeVash> Woolie, at least read "Fall of Reach."

[0:56:34] <duskrush> Being able to remove the gun is how they did Red vs Blue later on, iirc. in the first Red vs Blue stuff they put black bars up to cover the gun but you can still see the reticle
[0:56:38] <stanlychicken> Cortana is just a normal ai chick winging it super hard

[0:56:56] <@Menitta> "Don't fuck with Halo Fans. We won't stop explaining the lore"

[1:00:34] <+yamato63> yay caught this live this time
[1:00:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> BY ACCIDENT
[1:00:35] <+D00msDayDan> hey it worked for 30 years
[1:00:35] <+Invaderjaymz> BIG WHOOPIES
[1:00:37] <+JeluxDaCasual> I LOVE BEES
[1:00:38] <+superb_superbia> Jesus
[1:00:39] <hereiam345> It was a mistake though
[1:00:39] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> It's the Clone Wars
[1:00:42] <armchairmaster_> Wait they found it by ACCIDENT?!
[1:00:42] <buster7800> ACCIDENTALY V
[1:00:45] <hereiam345> Cole proticol makes sense
[1:00:47] <+Invaderjaymz> DAT EARTH
[1:00:48] <theother1122> big true
[1:00:49] <%lewdskeletor13> There’s a book about it
[1:00:51] <zamzoph> @Rumbutt yeah, better 27 YEARS than DAY 1
[1:00:52] <hereiam345> Considering....
[1:00:55] <+JeluxDaCasual> The Cole Protocol is a book
[1:00:56] <leroyslammin> "Yo what's this Blue Planet in the middle of nowhere?" -The Covenant
[1:00:56] <LasagnaXaga> Cole Protocol is like delete my browser history when I die
[1:00:59] <%DatAsuna> TBF without that they woulda smashed earth early and then halo wouldn't happen
[1:00:59] <slix3431> @WoolieVersus Hey Woolie thanks for getting me into fighting games and reuniting me with Cody. When are you gonna have NEON NIGHT drop cause you love the Halo music?
[1:00:59] <duskrush> That's why they only showed up with only a few ships
[1:01:00] <%Reverend_Roscoe> ACCIDENTALLY FOUND
[1:01:01] <%GeneralSCPatton> It's a tone-setter for how one-sided the war is.
[1:01:03] <+BigBlackBankai> They're aliens tho
[1:01:04] <GodKingReiss> Halo 3: Finish the Thought
[1:01:05] <vulkan_vibes> this was the exact v line i was hoping for
[1:01:07] <huskarl_zap> Thats totally what that means
[1:01:08] <%JohnAtDawn> ...Except Lucas himself did that in Menace?
[1:01:09] <Davimotion96> It's the whole reason humanity survived the war for 20 years. Come on V!
[1:01:11] <%DesDavis> it's also mentioned in Reach
[1:01:12] <%brachydios777> @armchairmaster_ Coeincidence is a bitch
[1:01:12] <Talyndemon> "Whoops, we accidentally the Human homeworld" Regret indeed.
[1:01:17] <hereiam345> Halo 2 was a mistake though, when they foudn it!!
[1:01:20] <%Reverend_Roscoe> they didn't know
[1:01:28] <alrobot2014> oops all humans
[1:01:29] <R3Roundabout> They found it on accident. Thank for the BS V
[1:01:31] <Professor_Dr_Muffins> good luck with the stream today!
[1:01:31] <+cowardman93> they found Earth on purpose but not knowing it's the human homeworld
[1:01:31] <+jojothegod125> you should watch halo legends its a series of anthology shorts in the style if different art styles and they are all pretty good
[1:01:34] <%DatAsuna> it's basically like the maginot line where people misunderstand it's purpose
[1:01:35] <malcobraaklynny> the Covenant detected an artifact on Earth
[1:01:36] <vaderxyz1970> THANK YOU
[1:01:37] <+HotBloodedHero> The Cole protocol has been unimportant since 2 BECAUSE they found it.
[1:01:37] <vulkan_vibes> LOTTA HUMANS HERE
[1:01:39] <derap41> Just fell dick first into earth
[1:01:41] <vaderxyz1970> VINDICATED
[1:01:43] <OldManDeckardCain> just casual freeza holidays
[1:01:50] <+JeluxDaCasual> They found Earth because a group of shitlord kids accidently set off a pulse beacon
[1:01:51] <+BigBlackBankai> Wait, it was humans all along?
[1:01:52] <Sauceboss15> @cowardman93 thank you for spreading truth
[1:01:52] <$QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus "Hmm, there are humans here oh shit oh shit they have cannons that just delete capital ships"
[1:01:54] <SnakeVash> The arbiter wouldn't have had that problem
[1:01:55] <$roguemerc69> Thought Cole Protocol was about randomly jumping from battle so they cant be followed
[1:01:59] <duskrush> Whoops accidentally stumbled into the enemy homeworld
[1:02:02] <+TheShisno> Easy Anti Cheat sucks
[1:02:04] <LasagnaXaga> V, have you played/Read the story of the Wars games?
[1:02:05] <%Karkatstoaster> Uhhhh I subbed... and it says I’m tier one... and yet the emotes are still saying “you need tier one sub to use”... I am confusion
[1:02:06] <+payterodactyl> easyanticheat caught Woolie's aimbot boys
[1:02:06] <NotHereToStream> make sure your capture software is working v
[1:02:07] <%GeneralSCPatton> @roguemerc69 That too
[1:02:11] <alrobot2014> @roguemerc69 both
[1:02:11] <%ringabal> *Spiderman pointing at each other*
[1:02:13] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @roguemerc69 nah
[1:02:15] <%Hammerknife> woolie isn't it time for lunch it's a bit early to be streaming
[1:02:16] <R3Roundabout> The protocol worked so well that when they went to earth they were surprised we were here
[1:02:17] <hereiam345> Yes yes yes, here we gooo
[1:02:19] <%GeneralSCPatton> @karkatstoaster Restart the app
[1:02:22] <treacherously_> As someone who’s never played halo I refuse to understand the lore so I can’t be spoiled
[1:02:22] <$TheFabledAble> Cheer500 Hey guys! want to apologize for my message at the end of kotor 2 that brought up pillars of eternity 2, I thought I was being vague enough when I was making my comparisons between kreia and another character but I guess I wasnt! Sorry about that, hope yall enjoy pillars 2 when you get to it ^_^
[1:02:25] <%brachydios777> @jeluxdacasual They were there to Earth just to get Forerunner stuff
[1:02:25] <$TheFabledAble> TheFabledAble's Cheer shared rewards to 10 others in Chat! 
[1:02:31] <%DomunDomunDomun> The random jump was part of it, and is what they did before halo CE.
[1:02:32] <$BallerSwagBro9k> SourPls
[1:02:33] <+lioan515> Sasuga Cole-Sama
[1:02:36] <+payterodactyl> When you first saw halo were you blinded by its majesty?
[1:02:40] <%DomunDomunDomun> Except it wasn't actually random because Cortana.
[1:02:42] <%Solidnick18> woolieGASM
[1:02:42] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Kreygasm
[1:02:42] <Catpurrple> @roguemerc69 The point still remains not letting them find more human worlds, jumping away from earth and everything means they won't get any closer when pursuing.
[1:02:43] <leroyslammin> Covenant Glassing Beams are like intercourse between a ship and a planet.
[1:02:43] <yaboyregret> Thanks for the PrideWave @thefabledable

[1:13:19] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @raven_frame just started gameplay
[1:13:26] <TheHylianGuard> I think they generally did a good job at keeping the look intact in this remaster
[1:13:35] <TheHylianGuard> unlike the Halo 1 anniversary one
[1:13:39] <%macabreopus> Somebody already told him the name of Brutes' vehicles, the playable vehicles names don't matter, only the mega fleet ships with the bad ass names like Pillar of Autumn matter
[1:13:42] <%shadowsofpain> yes he did but it flew past his head
[1:13:44] <Curtis_64> was the halo 2 remaster released before mcc?
[1:13:48] <+cowardman93> honestly this is one of the best remasters ever
[1:13:51] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> can't you destroy drop ships if you have enough firepower or is that in 3 onward?
[1:13:58] <+cowardman93> halo 2 remaster was made for the MCC
[1:14:00] <%brachydios777> @curtis_64 With
[1:14:01] <+yeeter_baelish> use the sword
[1:14:01] <%raven_frame> I was going to drop a paid message before the gameplay started, all well.
[1:14:02] <%Irridium> @Curtis_64 it was released with the MCC. was one of the main selling points
[1:14:08] <%TheRagabash> TheRagabash subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:14:08] <Curtis_64> ahh ok thanks
[1:14:12] <GameOver_Here> You can totally blow up the dropships, they just take a massive amount of damage

[1:15:04] <karl_rex> So OP they took it out in 3
[1:15:07] <$QueequegTheater> @TheHylianGuard Yeah but they also buffed the shit out of single needler
[1:15:10] <%macabreopus> Is it blasphemous to say the HL2 Remaster looks a little better than HL3? Still think HL3 is the best Halo game to date regardless
[1:15:13] <GameOver_Here> @malcobraaklynny no you can blow them up ive done it

[1:25:35] <%LiquidDinosaur> In halo 2 doesnt the Plasma Pistol charge not do any "damage?"

[1:26:10] <BlacSoul> hoooo boy
[1:26:10] <%a_goth_pancake> so Spartan Assault when?
[1:26:11] <%subjectg> @liquiddinosaur it does some damage, but it’s very inefficient
[1:26:15] <brian_peppers1> more fire means more speed right?
[1:26:17] <+GeneralHysterics> not ideal
[1:26:19] <%raven_frame> "Do Halo 2 Legendary in three hours." Yeah sure I will.
[1:26:30] <+payterodactyl> do h2 laso with no cheats
[1:26:33] <+HotBloodedHero> I love that the sound of the ghosts blowing up is an electric guitar
[1:26:33] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @lewdskeletor13 what's funny to me is that there's achievements surrounding obscure easter eggs like the Meg room in the first game or the scarab gun in the second that you have to do these dumb obscure glitches to access
[1:26:35] <GodKingReiss> Painting on flames is too time consuming, better to get the real thing going
[1:26:40] <%LiquidDinosaur> @subjectg i remember killing an entire room except 1 grunt and our of curiosity i emptied an entire plasma pistol on him in overcharges and he didnt die
[1:26:42] <$BallerSwagBro9k> For some reason the Halo 3 level titles arent quirky like 1 and 2
[1:26:45] <%a_goth_pancake> pfft, the faster I did h2 legendary was 11
[1:26:47] <Gamerprince333> i was watching you and pat talk about halo when i got the notification that you was playing halo 2 lol
[1:26:53] <%dinnydanny777> Isn't this the game with the infinite gun easter egg?
[1:26:59] <%subjectg> At the very least you get envy for halo 2 laso
[1:26:59] <%MrMoonGoose> b o i
[1:27:00] <%a_goth_pancake> dude I forgot how balls hard halo 3 was.
[1:27:01] <%lewdskeletor13> The Elites are a bit like Mandos I suppose except that the Elites are racially based where as Mandos are creed based
[1:27:05] <mikesapartment> run them over
[1:27:06] <tag545> scarab gun yes
[1:27:07] <zocano> Halo 2 has the scarab gun
[1:27:10] <IsThisOne> @ballerswagbro9k yeah but they're cooler though
[1:27:12] <malcobraaklynny> and the achievement to play 1000 multiplayer matches, and to win 500 matches
[1:27:14] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Tru
[1:27:21] <%subjectg> @liquiddinosaur sounds about right
[1:27:22] <%Slimshazbot> I always wondered why these ruins are old and stone and not like other forerunner structures
[1:27:29] <IsThisOne> fucking infinite devil machine
[1:27:31] <%dinnydanny777> This music is great
[1:27:32] <Holycow8498> Yes it was Halo 2 that had the scarab gun easter egg/gitch
[1:27:35] <Holycow8498> iirc
[1:27:43] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Luckily, a lot of the game's achievements seem to unlock at random for doing random things.
[1:27:46] <slix3431> Woolie bail that things gonna blow
[1:27:48] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @Slimshazbot probably cuz it looks cool and the forerunners were all about aesthetics
[1:27:50] <$BallerSwagBro9k> ouch
[1:27:50] <%raven_frame> The next terminal should have something Halo Legends related in it, so I'm looking forward to that.
[1:27:51] <+payterodactyl> @Slimshazbot A E S T H E T I C

[1:29:53] <brian_peppers1> double plasma is so OP in early game
[1:29:54] <%Irridium> Arbiter x that one elite who says he's cute
[1:30:03] <%raven_frame> Framerate drops are probably due in part of the "online" co-op. Otherwise it only usually happens at level loading points.

[1:30:24] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Catpurrple tungsten
[1:30:28] <%raven_frame> It's that superior human engineering.
[1:30:30] <leroyslammin> The realistic and meta answer is that Elites do have penises, they just didn't model em because they wanted to actually sell the game to a wide audience.
[1:30:31] <+CyanDeadEye> Human ground game is better than Covenant, but none of that matters because Covenant have better space game.
[1:30:31] <%Tadashi047> they have the scarab

[1:31:05] <+UberWolfman> Tank vs one very placed plasma gernade Kappa
[1:31:05] <%krispen_wa> I like how covenant tech is some crazy plasma shit, but it all gets torn to shreds by RAILGUN
[1:31:07] <Holycow8498> Woolioe borded a ghost
[1:31:08] <%subjectg> @dabeaminator once again, there’s a reason implied later
[1:31:10] <SnakeVash> plasma pistol would be so useful right now
[1:31:11] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @CyanDeadEye humans having better tanks is like saying "yeah but I can dribble the ball fast tho" when you're down 100 points to 6
[1:31:35] <brian_peppers1> an added challenge tho
[1:31:36] <%Karkatstoaster> @dabeaminator I mean to be fair races typically have more than one architectural style

[1:57:17] <+GeneralHysterics> Legendary Jackals are R 0 0 D
[1:57:18] <vulkan_vibes> miss less, V
[1:57:18] <%Asuterisuku> Legendary Jackals DO NOT MISS.
[1:57:19] <%The_Timo> V brain no work

[1:57:21] <MasterMushin> brain work good?
[1:57:23] <%RunningNGunning> They have aimbot on Legendary
[1:57:23] <R3c0n31> Talk Less, Smile More
[1:57:24] <+phatmac16> snipers on legendary are insane
[1:57:24] <+D00msDayDan> yeah in halo 2 that just kills you
[1:57:24] <$BallerSwagBro9k> THEY DONT MISS

[1:57:27] <+Kqha4000> on legendary there is no warning
[1:57:27] <AppleBerryKitty> yes they 1 hit and their hit marker is 100%
[1:57:27] <Xiangchang> If they miss, it's on purpose.
[1:57:28] <Visorak6> LP tax
[1:57:30] <%Creggamonsta> everything just hurts more
[1:57:34] <%The_Timo> It's all that battery gas
[1:57:34] <+barrakuta371> Legendary Jackals are the stuff of nightmares
[1:57:35] <iamtheTwitchghost> legendary jackals miss like 1 out of 10 shots
[1:57:36] <bleugh> more or less miss
[1:57:37] <Holycow8498> Legendary Jackals are mother fuckers on legendary
[1:57:38] <+Juriasu> legendary jackals will kill you and you're entire family
[1:57:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> V, are you stroking out?
[1:57:45] <%RioGascar> Jackel: next time i wont miss
[1:57:46] <Holycow8498> I mean in Halo 2
[1:57:47] <gatorafan> hit miss more less
[1:57:55] <%boomer059> I wonder how the flood intended to defeat the legendary jackal snipers
[1:58:02] <+phatmac16> legendary jackals will snipe your controller batteries
[1:58:04] <%DrDestro> Ha
[1:58:08] <The_Swedish_X> They can 1 shot the moment you walk in on halo 2 legendary
[1:58:15] <Holycow8498> The flood wasn't going to be able to defeat legendary Jackals
[1:58:15] <R3c0n31> nice shot
[1:58:15] <+TheShisno> Legendary is just a coin flip every half second

[1:58:31] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @Theycallmenerf A jackal sniped it
[1:58:33] <Halospaz117> @Theycallmenerf The jackals sniped woolie's battery
[1:58:33] <R3c0n31> @Theycallmenerf Batery went boom

[1:58:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Theycallmenerf battery blew up, woolie washed hands
[1:58:37] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Theycallmenerf Battery blew, Woolie washed his hands
[1:58:39] <karovus> if you relate it to fighting games woolie will understand
[1:58:40] <+phatmac16> legendary jackals are the chuck norris memes for real
[1:58:43] <masterfire23> getting a high refresh monitor helped me a lot with reading animations for fps games
[1:58:50] <The_Swedish_X> Halo 3 legendary will warning shot before quickly hitting you.
[1:58:54] <%Asuterisuku> In Counter-Strike they call that a collateral.
[1:59:06] <R3c0n31> 8/10 ragdoll
[1:59:10] <%stemlo_> @Asuterisuku Its cllaed that in everythjing forever
[1:59:14] <%Theycallmenerf> The stand of Halo 2: Legendary Jackal Sniper targeted Woolie then. Sick
[1:59:14] <letshavecakes> They are both hitscan
[1:59:15] <%stemlo_> typing
[1:59:32] <%RioGascar> i wonder if rhe warning shot idea was taken from gears of war where the first shot in any level or new enemy will always miss
[1:59:34] <Scorian> these games are sick
[1:59:40] <%subjectg> look at them alien birds
[1:59:44] <%RioGascar> but it looks scary thi
[1:59:45] <%Karkatstoaster> Oo that alien screech noise

[2:20:01] <DSD24> Quick question for the chat, do you get different armor in Reach by playing the multiplayer?
[2:20:05] <%dinnydanny777> It also doesn't cost ammo
[2:20:05] <%Ancopro> but no lock on
[2:20:07] <DeltaD36> It's shorter range though
[2:20:07] <Heavensguard92> Parry this you demon casual

[2:20:14] <%dinnydanny777> It also doesn't cost ammo, I think

[2:20:30] <+Affiliate_> @DSD24 you used to in old reach. MCC its seasonal unlocks etc
[2:20:32] <%raven_frame> Beam and sword.
[2:20:35] <%Irridium> @DSD24 you can unlock more armor playing multiplayer, yes. but you can do the same in campaign now too
[2:20:36] <Ardyn_1zunia> SWING FIRST
[2:20:37] <%subjectg> It’s a sword, not a fighter jet
[2:20:46] <Holycow8498> If they try out multiplayer i can't wait tell V and Woolie have an energy sword duel in Halo 3
[2:20:46] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @ringabal One of his stand powers is to find FG tech in anything
[2:20:48] <Heavensguard92> Swords are always a cool option
[2:20:50] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> you know, now that I'm thinking about it, the concept of weak points don't exist in a lot of games woolie likes (I.E. Fighting games) so it makes sense that he just tries to shoot the hunters in the front
[2:20:50] <%Asuterisuku> @Affiliate_ The seasonal unlocks have changed, though.
[2:20:54] <DeltaD36> >h doesn't know
[2:20:57] <letshavecakes> Yeah woolie, you just gotta frame trap the hunters and combo into raging demon
[2:20:59] <StarlitStunner> What’s so hard about swish swish stab
[2:21:00] <+Affiliate_> @Asuterisuku they change with every season
[2:21:02] <+THE_CYB3R_FOX> R trigger then x, Sword Cancel
[2:21:03] <ZeeJiggle> So I love how new sword looks. But I prefer the old sword sound.
[2:21:06] <%CptnCampy61> Sword matches online were the best
[2:21:06] <wiretapioca> Are Brutes secretly Tang Flavoured Tangelas?

[2:26:23] <tag545> plasma then sword
[2:26:24] <%ChoculaUltra> heroic
[2:26:24] <%Nomad94> This is Heroic
[2:26:25] <$QueequegTheater> God I hate that Anniversary sound effect
[2:26:28] <brambobelurkin> 2fer
[2:26:29] <%Asuterisuku> Sanghili or Elites.
[2:26:31] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @macabreopus it's in this game too
[2:26:33] <%Nomad94> The h in Sangheili is not silent
[2:26:33] <karovus> they studied the blade
[2:26:35] <TungstenViper> thanks chat :)
[2:26:35] <R3c0n31> Elites or Sangeli
[2:26:38] <+YabbaTroll> big warship
[2:26:40] <DesertPenguin> They have the high ground Ani
[2:26:44] <%Karkatstoaster> Tbf Prophets aren’t all nerds. They’re pretty powerful tech wise, and I think the young ones are abt human strength?
[2:26:44] <DeltaD36> They had Forerunner tech, so yeah
[2:26:47] <Djinnazz> and the brutes
[2:26:49] <%quinnage7> Prophets had forerunner tech
[2:26:49] <Goraka91> @dabeaminator I find that hard to believe, but then they had to have made the Covenant somehow LUL
[2:26:51] <derap41> if it wasn't them it would have been another spieces
[2:26:57] <%Asuterisuku> Sang-Heelie.
[2:26:59] <%lewdskeletor13> The prophets had forerunner tech
[2:27:00] <TheChucklingOak> didn't the prophets just carpet bomb shit instead of actually fighting?
[2:27:01] <zocano> Prophets had big cheats
[2:27:03] <%shutupandjam3465> @macabreopus yep. As long as you hit each other at the same time neiter will die
[2:27:03] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Tech's for bitches tbh
[2:27:04] <wiretapioca> Da Sermon
[2:27:06] <ThaSparren> Yea there are prophet warrior that are badasses too
[2:27:08] <Ardyn_1zunia> Almost there. I'm getting hyped for the prompt
[2:27:09] <%ringabal> Prophecy, if you will
[2:27:09] <DeltaD36> gotta give him a sec.
[2:27:09] <Heavensguard92> Prophets probably had tech
[2:27:10] <+TheShisno> San'shyese
[2:27:11] <DeltaD36> It's this one.
[2:27:13] <$BallerSwagBro9k> https://clips.twitch.tv/TriumphantEndearingNewtEleGiggle
[2:27:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> WOLOLO
[2:27:17] <Goraka91> HYPERS
[2:27:22] <SnakeVash> he says it faster if you shoot the barrels
[2:27:23] <aluddss> SangElites
[2:27:26] <%raven_frame> It is this one.
[2:27:26] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @Karkatstoaster IIRC the prophets used to be human strength or stronger physically but their race has been so fucked by weird incest and pampering that they're super weak now
[2:27:27] <+yeeter_baelish> dangPogU
[2:27:27] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i mean he's not wrong
[2:27:29] <%Th3SmartAlec> "Are we there yet?"
[2:27:34] <+vaultzombie> Robin Atkin Downes PogChamp
[2:27:35] <TungstenViper> sure
[2:27:36] <+dezimaly> do they even have legs
[2:27:37] <+Juriasu> no he does not
[2:27:39] <%dinnydanny777> Suicide pact?
[2:27:41] <DeltaD36> Is that Robert Atkins?
[2:27:42] <Goraka91> Death cult Pog
[2:27:43] <wiretapioca> WE THINK ABOUT DA CRUSADES
[2:27:44] <%macabreopus> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug Cool, I remember crossing swords, then clipping back real quick with the B button!
[2:27:44] <%Solidnick18> no
[2:27:44] <%Asuterisuku> This one does not.
[2:27:47] <+YabbaTroll> he has little bitch legs
[2:27:51] <%ChoculaUltra> in retrospect, Kaathe and Frampt from Souls give off Prophet vibes. Kinda look alike too with the whole long neck thing
[2:27:52] <+ThePimpGuin> is it possible to up the voice sound?
[2:27:53] <%BisoromiBear> cool chair tho
[2:27:53] <%Irridium> yes they give you a lot of cool stuff 4Head
[2:27:54] <R3c0n31> Truth is the only one that knows, no?
[2:27:55] <DeltaD36> Oh fuck suddenly I can hear the medic now
[2:27:58] <%krispen_wa> Fucking Frieza
[2:27:59] <spacebowie749> he does have legs you could see it through the chair
[2:27:59] <Sullry> they knew btw
[2:28:00] <Goraka91> @ChoculaUltra I can see it
[2:28:02] <%ringabal> I guess total material annihilation is a sort of transcendence
[2:28:02] <+CyanDeadEye> Man this part was a bitch on LASO
[2:28:03] <Holycow8498> So has Woolie recognized regrets voice? '
[2:28:05] <+Asuterisuku> @R3c0n31 Shhhhhh
[2:28:05] <omen_setter> It took me years to find that little scene by accident
[2:28:05] <+YabbaTroll> all 3 know i think
[2:28:05] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie: "Now THIS is how you properly lead a cult."
[2:28:07] <%dinnydanny777> But the strongest among us are those who can barely stand, Woolie
[2:28:11] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @ThePimpGuin no, actually, there's no setting for it in MCC
[2:28:11] <%DesDavis> @DeltaD36 oh fuck lol
[2:28:11] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:28:12] <Holycow8498> also yeah Robin Atkin Downes voices the prophet of regret
[2:28:13] <%Karkatstoaster> One Guy in a chair
[2:28:14] <%Nomad94> @Holycow8498 from where?
[2:28:16] <spacebowie749> hes kind of in a kneel position
[2:28:16] <MasterMushin> says 2 dudes in a chair talking about religion
[2:28:21] <dabeaminator> Frampt would absolutely be all in on the Great Journey
[2:28:22] <%Nomad94> Oh, Downes again
[2:28:24] <Goraka91> I too hate bugs Kappa
[2:28:26] <%quinnage7> shut the fuck up chat
[2:28:26] <TheChucklingOak> nooo marine
[2:28:33] <wiretapioca> Man in Car SPEAKS HIS MIND
[2:28:34] <JoshyJay> marine FeelsBadMan
[2:28:34] <+ThePimpGuin> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug well shit
[2:28:34] <%macabreopus> @shutupandjam3465 In Multiplayer it was the most clutch of duels. More games (non-Star Wars) need laser swords
[2:28:44] <jacob2pop> It's the Planet of the Apes cult worshipping the nuke
[2:28:45] <+GeneralHysterics> solving two different problems is the point of gun comps
[2:28:56] <%Graem> oh cool we got half-life antlions
[2:28:56] <+GeneralHysterics> beam rifle sword is fine, if limited.
[2:28:59] <DeltaD36> nice shot
[2:28:59] <DianaTheAscian> do the prophets even believe their own bs?
[2:29:03] <Goraka91> @jacob2pop I always forget that series ended with complete annihilation
[2:29:05] <Holycow8498> God Robin Atkin downes has voiced in a lot of shit most notably i can think of is him being Miller in Metal Gear solid peace walker and so on @Nomad94
[2:29:06] <%Nomad94> I forgot just how long Regret is as a leve
[2:29:06] <+GeneralHysterics> need something to deal with lesser nerds
[2:29:07] <+novacrusader727> God that sniper sounds sooo good
[2:29:14] <TheChucklingOak> stop talking about stuff that comes laterr
[2:29:20] <%RioGascar> I feel like yes the prophets do believe their stuff
[2:29:20] <%Nomad94> *level
[2:29:20] <%Karkatstoaster> Hello chat I am currently petting my cat. She is an orange tabby and is named hope and ISV cute. Thx I just wanted to share : )
[2:29:20] <%Asuterisuku> BR/Carbine+Sword is probably my favourite comp.
[2:29:30] <%Th3SmartAlec> ...
[2:29:33] <%ringabal> pfft
[2:29:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> CAT
[2:29:37] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @novacrusader727 all the guns in the halo franchise are so satisfying. the shotgun and the sniper are by far the best incarnations of those weapons in any fps ever
[2:29:41] <%cobalt_phoenix_> pet fluffy cat
[2:29:41] <TheChucklingOak> thank you karkatstoaster
[2:29:45] <%lewdskeletor13> @karkatstoaster Hell yeah give that cat a pet for me
[2:29:45] <+GeneralHysterics> carbine sword is super strong too.
[2:29:50] <StarlitStunner> avalonSMUG
[2:29:58] <%DomunDomunDomun> Woolie trying to find the battle rifle that was in his hands.
[2:30:03] <wiretapioca> Anyone remember the character assets way outside the intended map?
[2:30:04] <$QueequegTheater> Laura Prepon
[2:30:06] <Goraka91> The guns are working!
[2:30:12] <%Asuterisuku> There's a reason Carbine Sword is Arbiter's loadout in KI.
[2:30:14] <DeltaD36> That female marine is voiced by the Red Head from That 70's Show.
[2:30:14] <%GeneralSCPatton> @karkatstoaster Ye, give catto the petto
[2:30:18] <+YabbaTroll> <3 Stacker
[2:30:18] <$QueequegTheater> Also Stacker is alive
[2:30:20] <brambobelurkin> Did they remove the bullet trail in the remaster? I dont see it when he shoots. Something nostalgic about that bullet trail
[2:30:30] <%Graem> when the AI takes out the enemies before you do
[2:30:32] <%anita_dickin> Stacker has returned
[2:30:34] <Halospaz117> Damn, Stacker revived quick
[2:30:35] <WattieWasTaken> god the sniper in the remake mode sound so lame
[2:30:38] <StarlitStunner> lytJACKPOT Stacker
[2:30:38] <Ardyn_1zunia> Does Woolie know that the Prophet of Regret is also Travis Touchdown?
[2:30:38] <Dean_Inbetween> The vast majority of the covenant has no idea that any they could believe is false, the leadership only found proof against there beliefs in the middle of the war, at which point it was too late to go back
[2:30:39] <%Asuterisuku> Beyond just giving him melee options.
[2:30:41] <DeltaD36> Stacker doesn't die.
[2:30:41] <%shutupandjam3465> @macabreopus Oh man, I remember half the time it just came down to pushing someone else into a wall when you lunged at the for about te 6th or 7th parry. Or the every once in a while youd lunge yourslef off a cliff LUL
[2:30:46] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @brambobelurkin I don't think it shows up on sniper bullets you shoot but it shows up when someone else shoots it
[2:30:50] <+novacrusader727> Stacker stacks up
[2:30:51] <wiretapioca> smokey bullet trail is best bullet trail
[2:30:54] <DSD24> Keep it tight
[2:30:56] <+TheShisno> Only two people have been in more combat: Chief and Chipps Dubbo
[2:30:56] <SnakeVash> You should really shoot the helmet off the Marine. They have full head models
[2:30:58] <%RioGascar> Stacker, the new johnson
[2:31:00] <+CyanDeadEye> @brambobelurkin It disappears faster
[2:31:02] <Dean_Inbetween> Stack also voices keys
[2:31:04] <Dean_Inbetween> Keyes
[2:31:06] <wiretapioca> GET GLASSED
[2:31:06] <$QueequegTheater> Stacker for Smash
[2:31:09] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> WHAT BADASSES
[2:31:10] <%anita_dickin> Wheres my boy Dubbo
[2:31:10] <+yeeter_baelish> PogChamp
[2:31:16] <+ThePimpGuin> marines!
[2:31:16] <%Th3SmartAlec> They're fucking GOOD
[2:31:18] <DeltaD36> Those phantom lasers do shit damage
[2:31:21] <Ardyn_1zunia> Humans are evolving because of the constant glassing
[2:31:23] <%raven_frame> He's still going!
[2:31:23] <brambobelurkin> Ahh makes sense. I wasn't seeing the trail and not gonna lie I got a little sad lol
[2:31:23] <%Reverend_Roscoe> are we THERE yet?
[2:31:25] <+vaultzombie> Wed ewite :3
[2:31:26] <%ringabal> Stacks on stacks on stacks
[2:31:28] <%Graem> plot armour
[2:31:29] <Heavensguard92> Chad Marines vs virgin spartan
[2:31:32] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Dean_Inbetween and he was also the best 99¢ Store knockoff of Aramaki ever: COMMANDER TERRENCE GRIFFIN
[2:31:34] <wiretapioca> UWUUUU
[2:31:37] <mikesapartment> those whites are too strong
[2:31:38] <dabeaminator> Woolie still hasn't picked up a Fuel Rod
[2:31:38] <drewslo> woolie is the only one allowed to kill the Marines
[2:31:41] <%dinnydanny777> Shot him the back like a big hero
[2:31:48] <DeltaD36> in the dick
[2:31:49] <+TheShisno> Can't wait for his best line in 3. "Someooone, anyoooone, pleeease respooond"
[2:31:49] <%GeneralSCPatton> @dean_inbetween Well of course. The FIRST RULE of any religion is "We could never be wrong. Everyone else is wrong. Fuck you, we'll crusade you for thinking we could ever be fallible."
[2:31:49] <%Th3SmartAlec> Aim for the dick
[2:31:49] <%Asuterisuku> V picked up a fuel rod last session.
[2:31:54] <Goraka91> While I love Jackals, they deserve it
[2:31:56] <%macabreopus> @shutupandjam3465 Nothing more satisfying than lunging at someone with a sword, nothing more terrifying than being lunged AT with a sword!
[2:31:56] <brambobelurkin> well placed grenade there Woolie
[2:31:59] <BlacSoul> Woolies getting much better
[2:32:07] <+yeeter_baelish> SPACE CRUSADE
[2:32:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @GeneralSCPatton sounds about right
[2:32:19] <Dean_Inbetween> @liquiddinosaur was that, that old ass pc game martys company did the voice work for? It looked like a sci fi diablo?
[2:32:20] <%raven_frame> Master Chief has to friendly fire any marines that outshine him.
[2:32:20] <wiretapioca> WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW MORE
[2:32:22] <Halospaz117> frieeeends
[2:32:24] <alrobot2014> marines with rockets sounds handy
[2:32:24] <TheFranss> OH NO
[2:32:25] <%Asuterisuku> Lots of weapons around here.
[2:32:25] <+novacrusader727> I really hope they hit up ODST
[2:32:27] <%Karkatstoaster> *shoots honor guard* “OOOOOOO THATS NOT SO NICE DEMON-CHAN UWU”
[2:32:29] <%Th3SmartAlec> Rowcket LawnChair
[2:32:29] <%BisoromiBear> rocket lawn chair
[2:32:32] <Ardyn_1zunia> Almost there...
[2:32:32] <Goraka91> What could possibly go wrong
[2:32:33] <jacob2pop> I like how even the Covenant are like "Boy Jackals are scumbags."
[2:32:35] <brambobelurkin> @macabreopus I will say the one thing I found more satisfying is watching the sword animation start and swapping to shot gun for that sweet sweet bulltrue
[2:32:37] <%vextalyst> vextalyst subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! Hey woolie this month's reccomendation goes out to Vindictus which is the only MMO I could ever see you playing. Literally the best action combat in any MMO. Only downside is it's kind of a janky, RNG pay to win piece of shit. But besides that it's great.
[2:32:38] <%Graem> lawnchair
[2:32:39] <%lewdskeletor13> I think Woolie would really dig ODST
[2:32:41] <Heavensguard92> for a man who loves Titanfall and its verticality, Woolie does not look up often
[2:32:41] <Dean_Inbetween> @liquiddinosaur where steve and stacker did voice work for?
[2:32:45] <Djinnazz> weapon switch tech, just keep switching weapons till they're all on the elevator
[2:32:53] <%dekkitout> Be sure to not eat the glass
[2:32:53] <%Asuterisuku> That is glass that you cannot break, thankfully.
[2:32:54] <%krispen_wa> Gondola Part Dos
[2:33:03] <%cobalt_phoenix_> HMMM
[2:33:04] <%2hutown> Having glass floors like that would freak me out
[2:33:04] <SnakeVash> Brr trick: Firing and immediately meleeing only has you Firing a SINGLE bullet
[2:33:04] <brian_peppers1> Woolie is getting in the zone now but wait till next week when he forgets the controls again.
[2:33:05] <Who_lio42> need woolie to play Reach doe
[2:33:10] <DeltaD36> @WoolieVersus Make sure to hold the trigger to lock on.
[2:33:12] <Dean_Inbetween> Get ready for good music
[2:33:13] <TheFranss> After seeing Woolie using rocket launcher in Doom, I'm slightly conserned what will happen
[2:33:14] <+wunp_fxs> BETRYAL
[2:33:18] <Dean_Inbetween> GOOD MUSIC TIME
[2:33:19] <+YabbaTroll> did a marine just fall?
[2:33:20] <%gunslinger_xxiv> OH NO
[2:33:22] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> can't wait for woolie to forget the lock on exists in this game and whiff 5 shots on a single banshee
[2:33:22] <%subjectg> considering halo 2’s development, there’s a lot of elevator sequences
[2:33:23] <%FierceDeityGabe> Rocket duty but won't lock on
[2:33:25] <DeltaD36> The marines died.
[2:33:25] <Heavensguard92> yea a marine fell
[2:33:26] <%macabreopus> @brambobelurkin I genuinely cannot remember if it was an actual Multiplayer mode or if it was a custom game mode but there's one where it was only Shottys and Swords
[2:33:28] <%Th3SmartAlec> F
[2:33:28] <wiretapioca> I love that she sounds high
[2:33:29] <%Irridium> V just killed the marine
[2:33:29] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @2hutown Ever been to CN Tower?
[2:33:32] <+YabbaTroll> oh no D:
[2:33:32] <Goraka91> I swear Miranda was better at voice acting

[2:33:58] <VidulaSaix> The NPCs distracted them LUL
[2:33:58] <brambobelurkin> @macabreopus I cant for the life of me remember either. It may have been some form of zombies.
[2:33:59] <AThing_> @macabreopus A lot of the custom game stuff became multiplayer game modes at some point so probably both.
[2:34:00] <TheFranss> F fir the bois
[2:34:01] <jacob2pop> Can we talk about how full of shit Pat was when he said the music in Halo wasn't that good?
[2:34:02] <$QueequegTheater> The Marines are distracting them with their massive dicks

[2:38:06] <%Karkatstoaster> See I want to disregard pats opinions but disregarding them really isn’t distinct from just letting him get away with spewing stupid shit. Which is why I don’t listen to the podcast or watch his streams. Because everything he says and does is infuriating. But setting that aside- haha space gun go pew pew
[2:38:06] <%prime_name> What Spartan customization does the MCC use?

[2:58:59] <Joestar1890> The blue gas giant is named "Substance"
[2:59:01] <Lieutenant_America> So how did they release the Flood AGAIN knowing full well what was on this ring?
[2:59:03] <Holycow8498> Its a gas giant so fartimus prime that's what we shall call it

[2:59:17] <valachi> The Flood is a really scary concept for an enemy type. It's similar to The Thing.

[2:59:34] <+ryderbootz> if anyone remembers the MP map in Halo 3 Cold Storage, thats actually where all the flood on Delta Halo come from
[2:59:37] <Vital_Ire> Because the humans got here first.
[2:59:37] <turbofolk> dont worry about it
[2:59:38] <%subjectg> @lieutenant_america the implication here is that the flood spores broke containment long ago

[3:11:30] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[3:11:32] <dabeaminator> @stemlo_ I mean the lore people are forcing on him. He cares about what's in the games, and about learning it himself.

[3:19:12] <sniffy77> Mendicant Bias did everything wrong
[3:19:14] <+Lord_Kryos> Plasma grenades stick by literally melting on to you
[3:19:24] <CiaraRoses> Flood with a shotgun is just as bad as monkey with a gun
[3:19:25] <Louie_Salmon> Woolie is so gung-ho, just picking a spot and shooting whatever enters your line of sight is usually a very good plan
[3:19:27] <Ardyn_1zunia> So many Vergils for Woolie. Hunters and flood with shotguns are unstoppable. God forbid he takes them both on at the same time
[3:19:28] <Joestar1890> They're called Elites for a reason
[3:19:28] <+deadeyemax> does woolie know you can oneshot the flood if you shoot them in the parasite in the chest?

[3:19:46] <MajoraZ> that rock saved woolie's life
[3:19:48] <+yeeter_baelish> plasmas are very bad against flood
[3:19:50] <Goraka91> @Lord_Kryos So the shell of the grenade or you?
[3:19:50] <Reizie_Etherealm> The Akrid looks different from what I remember, I wonder if Woolie has enough Thermal Energy for when he finds a VS
[3:19:51] <nothuzad> Mechazoic_Era well it kinda got murdered with lost planet 3
[3:19:51] <Holycow8498> I think its clear
[3:19:52] <wiretapioca> Bunker Buster Woolie
[3:19:56] <%ChoculaUltra> plasmas in close range against flood seems like a bad time
[3:19:58] <Louie_Salmon> I feel like he wants to run and slide an do a flip before shooting once, when you could just spend all that time shooting
[3:19:59] <+Deyne_547> tap into your inner vergil woolie use your sword
[3:20:06] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> @Reizie_Etherealm God I miss Lost Planet MP FeelsBadMan

[3:35:54] <%LiquidDinosaur> @raven_frame the Halo 2 steelbook had a bonus book with lore and there's a transcript of 2 elites like "why dont we just let the humans join the Covenant? they'd be like braver grunts or more trustworthy jackals. Yeah they destroy Forerunner relics but they dont know better, the Hunters did that too till we converted them to our faith"
[3:36:01] <InugamiTheHound> sorry!! I messed up! I can't remember when that happened.

[3:38:29] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> I choose to imagine, even tho it's not correct, that the forerunners came up with the halo rings as their first solution and were just like "Yeah we have to literally annihilate all sentient life it's the only option" without thinking of anything else

[3:47:03] <%Firststrike_OW> SourPls
[3:47:04] <Catpurrple> All they needed was a little more intelligence to flip the elite armor shield switch to "on"
[3:47:06] <%Karkatstoaster> Just got back after dipping for like 45 minutes... have they seen THE CUTSCENE yet?

[4:00:29] <%BisoromiBear> 14 MONTHS
[4:00:30] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> CRUNCH
[4:00:33] <%lewdskeletor13> Halo 2 had rushed development
[4:00:35] <%LiquidDinosaur> THERE WAS GONNA BE A TANK
[4:00:36] <+novacrusader727> They did a lot of cuts
[4:00:36] <huskarl_zap> 18 month development
[4:00:36] <Vital_Ire> so was the gondola
[4:00:38] <+GreenCMD> all bungie Halos have huge dev hell
[4:00:38] <%LiquidDinosaur> A FORERUNNER TANK

[4:00:40] <RajelSkoven> They did wonders to Gravemind's look in MCC

[4:00:42] <%RioGascar> this games development was a mess
[4:00:45] <bubbli97> ah damn did i miss the Gravemind?
[4:00:45] <%dinnydanny777> The loading screen spoiled itself
[4:00:46] <%lewdskeletor13> Halo 2 is a lot like DMC 4 in that regard
[4:00:47] <alrobot2014> @BisoromiBear ODST was ACTUALLY 14 months
[4:00:47] <Ardyn_1zunia> The flying sentinel factory that crashed in Quarantine Zone was also a cut level
[4:00:47] <+TheShisno> Halo 2 was rushed and was a blockbuster like no other
[4:00:50] <Lieutenant_America> Halo 2's development was ridiculously wild
[4:00:52] <+phatmac16> Lots of cuts
[4:00:54] <Halospaz117> Yeah, this isn't exactly 14 months
[4:00:56] <Dean_Inbetween> Yes they did cut a level you were going meet the gravemind via level
[4:00:59] <%RioGascar> Halo 2 E3 demo
[4:01:03] <Catpurrple> They showed an E3 trailer in like 2003 or something, and it turns out it was complete lies because their engine was way too fucking advanced for OG xbox, it crashed the instant they looked in the wrong direction.
[4:01:05] <+novacrusader727> They scrapped the game like twice
[4:01:06] <OldOnyx> This game had horrendous pop in problems at launch on the xbox
[4:01:06] <Pnutz409> I remember i dj'd at a gamestop for this release.
[4:01:07] <huskarl_zap> some work.better under pressure
[4:01:08] <VidulaSaix> The Rap God

[4:02:15] <drewslo> I mean his gun was full of water
[4:02:15] <Catpurrple> I wouldn't be surprised if the lower streets of High Charity was full of posters of masterchief, just to let everyone know.
[4:02:18] <alrobot2014> save all the hype shit for last
[4:02:20] <%Nomad94> @storkeylope *there

[4:03:01] <RetributionP> Tell woolie to look at the old funny model of the rhyme monstar
[4:03:14] <CurrySauseBandit> Double SMG
[4:03:14] <huskarl_zap> Gravemind from SF5?
[4:03:17] <Joestar1890> OG Gravemind was just Audrey II
[4:03:18] <%subjectg> @brachydios777 flood juggernaut is the coolest thing when i was young
[4:03:26] <%dekkitout> Didn't gravemind look like he was from Little Shop?
[4:03:28] <%Th3SmartAlec> Pop off!
[4:03:29] <turbofolk> Woolie thougts ON THE BIG FLOOD MONSTER
[4:03:29] <%lewdskeletor13> “Now I shall talk, and YOU shall listen”

[4:03:34] <%brachydios777> @subjectg Too bad it was cut

[4:03:40] <Dean_Inbetween> Its so crazy that the high pitched voice actor of viewtiful joe can voice THAT!!

[4:03:49] <The_Swedish_X> Goop boy looked super goof in retrospect
[4:03:50] <Ardyn_1zunia> Old version is a giant venus fly trap
[4:03:50] <%brachydios777> Would have been cool to fight
[4:03:51] <Djinnazz> @WoolieVersus It looked like Semore
[4:03:51] <+einherjarvalk> surprised Woolie didn't say anything about Grand Wizard Tartarus
[4:03:52] <Ynkubus_> It was fine but aged awfully
[4:03:52] <%Firststrike_OW> It wasn't bad but the new design is so much better
[4:03:52] <OverlordLuna> LUL
[4:03:54] <drewslo> looked more like a talking flower
[4:03:55] <%Karkatstoaster> It’s like a muppet
[4:03:56] <%lewdskeletor13> Remastered is a million times better imo
[4:04:02] <%brachydios777> LUL LUL

[4:04:04] <Djinnazz> @WoolieVersus From little shop of Horrors
[4:04:06] <%Irridium> I kinda liked the old design honestly. Not too fond of "just a big worm"
[4:04:09] <+barrakuta371> @dean_inbetween I never realized that was the same VA
[4:04:11] <Pnutz409> Now bohemian Rhapsody!

[4:04:19] <tag545> plant monster
[4:04:19] <letshavecakes> There was no teeth
[4:04:19] <Mr_Taters > It's a little, Little shop of horrors-y (it still looked okay)
[4:04:20] <%DesDavis> it looked like a flower with some DSLs
[4:04:21] <%dekkitout> @macabreopus sbfpSOB
[4:04:21] <Dean_Inbetween> @barrakuta371 neither did i
[4:04:23] <GodKingReiss> It was basically a giant venus flytrap
[4:04:23] <ZeeJiggle> Ye it wasn't bad, but new thing way cooler
[4:04:24] <Xiangchang> More like a Venus Fly Trap with tentacles.
[4:04:25] <ScreamLord> It looks more like a Venus Flytrap
[4:04:32] <%Graem> so yeah audrey 2
[4:04:33] <+bronin2099> I always thought it was a giant plant
[4:04:33] <+attackofthesage> Kinda looks like a Piranha Plant
[4:04:34] <ralphfromdk> Looked more like a Muppet
[4:04:35] <%macabreopus> Little Shop of Halos
[4:04:38] <DianaTheAscian> i forgot that things name
[4:04:39] <%Karkatstoaster> Mr. All Your Sins, Monument To
[4:04:41] <Goraka91> It's certainly ancient
[4:04:44] <vincerocmm> zoneLemmy
[4:04:44] <letshavecakes> It was also greenish before, instead of flesh colored

[4:06:48] <@Menitta> LUL Killzone
[4:06:49] <DesertPenguin> Notice that most people that spoil shit are not followers or subscribers? They're just random people here to troll the streamer
[4:06:49] <%Irridium> Oh yeah they super believe (shut up extended universe)
[4:06:49] <drewslo> most of the prophets are true believers
[4:06:50] <letshavecakes> Only a few of the prophets are actually keyed in to the truth
[4:06:51] <DianaTheAscian> jokes on u V i barely remember these games
[4:06:51] <Vital_Ire> there are people today that believe what they're selling so
[4:06:54] <TheChucklingOak> Yeah chat, shuuuut up
[4:06:54] <vaderxyz1970> True believe r
[4:06:55] <%lewdskeletor13> if they actually knew I doubt they’d wanna kill themselves
[4:06:56] <ThaSparren> Its not malicious completely
[4:06:59] <duskrush> I don't think they fully comprehend Halo
[4:07:00] <+storkeylope> @dcdrewzee clearly not since Woolie wasn’t sure
[4:07:01] <ralphfromdk> I mean.. if they don't belive, they know they are trying to kill them selves... which is weird.
[4:07:07] <%Darksolstace> See ya guys, it’s been fun. Don’t ruin it for Woolz
[4:07:09] <%BoondockJoker> fun note - pay close attention to prophets names and how they handle themselves in conversation. the three are Truth, Regret, and Mercy
[4:07:12] <%prime_name> Fuckin Truth
[4:07:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[4:07:15] <DCDrewZee> He nailed it with his first guess, so lcealy he did
[4:07:16] <Halospaz117> 1 out of 3 popes
[4:07:18] <%BoondockJoker> tried to keep it unspoilery
[4:07:19] <duskrush> His hat is taller
[4:07:19] <%RioGascar> thing is tho...uh lets say chief didnt “kill” regret
[4:07:20] <%Karkatstoaster> I mean why would they want it activated if it kills everything
[4:07:21] <+smikeye> all of the Prophets buy into it
[4:07:22] <wiretapioca> FLOATiNG JUiCE?
[4:07:24] <%Tearonex> He's the Truth LUL
[4:07:25] <huskarl_zap> So hes right?
[4:07:25] <DSD24> Pulling a Vrook
[4:07:26] <%RioGascar> they were about to glass regret
[4:07:33] <zocano> His name is *Truth*
[4:07:35] <ScreamLord> He's King Pope
[4:07:40] <%Ancopro> Dono's don't make V mad now
[4:07:40] <%boomer059> Seymore Feed me Seymore
[4:07:41] <%Nomad94> And his name is John Cena
[4:07:46] <+Deyne_547> I guess the prophet of regret REGRETS his belief in the great journey
[4:07:48] <The_Swedish_X> I loved the good ol Robin Akin Downes scream he left us with.
[4:07:53] <huskarl_zap> Pope is the.king of the Vatican.
[4:07:56] <%Deadpal> yeahhhh!
[4:08:00] <%Deadpal> Another day at the beach was cool
[4:08:06] <%Deadpal> You can watch it right now 0 spoilers

[4:08:20] <+JeluxDaCasual> yeah, it's a cool bit
[4:08:23] <DesertPenguin> sounds like slice of life
[4:08:23] <+JeluxDaCasual> totally safe
[4:08:29] <RrenKrieg> it's basically Halo 2 ODST

[4:08:39] <+the_krypto_knight> Penitent Tangent is also a pretty baller name
[4:08:50] <%BisoromiBear> butt pirates?
[4:08:52] <+MaddyCaddy> 2 is WAY better than 1
[4:09:00] <+MaddyCaddy> 1 is still interesting though
[4:09:02] <+BaronVonFatty> i bounced off one alot too
[4:09:05] <Dohrck_the_Orc> A lot of people in chat tend to spoil things by thinking they're being "vague enough", not realizing the hints they give become to obvious
[4:09:08] <letshavecakes> PoE is really good, but you REALLY need to get deep into it
[4:09:10] <Dean_Inbetween> How do you like the name penitent tangent? @woolieversus
[4:09:20] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> pillars 2 being a direct sequel is the game's biggest flaw tbh
[4:09:20] <wiretapioca> Remember when people HATED 2?
[4:09:35] <AThing_> people hated PoE 2?
[4:09:35] <ThaSparren> Or just ask V to screen it
[4:09:37] <IndoorSitup> Chat cannot comprehend what Subtlety is.
[4:09:46] <+Roke27> The flood aren't just simple zombies though, you have to remember they were such a big threat that the race that could build HALO's couldn't contain them
[4:09:47] <andresisant> They hated it because of the end
[4:09:52] <+armor_kuma> which game we talkin about?
[4:09:55] <+serpenttucker> Problem is chat members are not thinking that what they are saying is a spoiler, or "That big of a deal"
[4:09:56] <+Slipknotlobster> Can we at least let woolie know Old One's name?
[4:09:57] <andresisant> Don´t read this woolie
[4:09:59] <Dohrck_the_Orc> Everyone want to try and be subtle, but not everyone is unfortunately.
[4:10:01] <%stemlo_> those ads are sick
[4:10:04] <Goraka91> The Halo ads are great
[4:10:09] <%kyh9> SO GOOD
[4:10:13] <+whiskeybuisness> the odst ad is sooooo badass
[4:10:13] <%brachydios777> Is the mind’s name a spoiler?
[4:10:15] <%lewdskeletor13> They’re very sick
[4:10:16] <zocano> ODST's main trailer is so fucking good
[4:10:18] <Joestar1890> BELIEVE is so great
[4:10:20] <+maenos2> @slipknotlobster So yourself this, has it been named in game? no.
[4:10:20] <%kyh9> SO MANY GOOD CLASSES
[4:10:25] <+Iamdenril> do they have plans to do odst and reach eventually?
[4:10:26] <%BisoromiBear> halo marketing gets me every time
[4:10:26] <Joestar1890> PLAYABLE BIOTIC GOD
[4:10:26] <jorniev> GRIFFBALL
[4:10:27] <+phatmac16> Best ads
[4:10:27] <%kyh9> COMPLETELY NEW FACTION
[4:10:28] <+Ixek> ME3's Multiplayer is amazing.
[4:10:29] <JTEIO> ME3 Multiplayer was sick
[4:10:29] <+aram909> ODST is my fav Halo campaign for sure
[4:10:31] <%Slimshazbot> Not 100% free, they had loot boxes
[4:10:34] <Goraka91> Hmm
[4:10:34] <+YabbaTroll> Dude me3 Multiplayer was so sick
[4:10:35] <+goose_attack_almanac> ME3 MULTIPLAYER IS SICK
[4:10:37] <Mr_Taters > Yeah Me3 multi was great
[4:10:39] <DarkestDawn64> ME3 multiplayer was great man...
[4:10:39] <DSD24> I love playing as a Salarian
[4:10:40] <%kyh9> THEY REBUILT THE COLLECTORS IN MULTIPLAYER
[4:10:40] <90k9> Is this pre or post stream?
[4:10:41] <VidulaSaix> Oof LUL
[4:10:42] <Yung_Booker> mass effect 3 multiplayer was so good
[4:10:43] <mikesapartment> cuz of MONEY
[4:10:43] <InugamiTheHound> I sucked ass at ME3 MP but I was pretty decent at MEA MP
[4:10:48] <%Robot_Nixon_> too much PJSalt
[4:10:48] <wiretapioca> Why not the Neill Blomkamp short film?
[4:10:48] <StarlitStunner> Collectors in ME3 multiplayer were wild
[4:10:48] <%Tearonex> ODST is a pretty damn great campaign
[4:10:50] <thebalticguy1> Multiplayer is so good
[4:10:53] <%ppararaj> Choose your colour ending
[4:10:53] <+phatmac16> Me3 multiplayer was sick
[4:10:54] <%BisoromiBear> big chonk
[4:10:55] <DCDrewZee> ME3 is still a great game, despite the salt over the edning
[4:10:56] <Joestar1890> HEAVY BOI
[4:10:56] <wiretapioca> HORSE ARMOR
[4:10:57] <+Iamdenril> john halo a strong assisted boi
[4:10:59] <MSCanyon> it supports itself with big power
[4:11:00] <ralphfromdk> That's some dense ass metal
[4:11:00] <Torivore> ME3's multiplayer is fucking AMAZING
[4:11:00] <Divryne> It costs about the same as a frigate too.
[4:11:00] <%Irridium> chief is a heavy boi
[4:11:02] <ThatGuyThere03> yes
[4:11:02] <%kyh9> They did more world-building in the ME3 Multiplayer than in the rest of the game
[4:11:03] <mesamus> BIG CHUNK
[4:11:03] <nothuzad> chief is a car
[4:11:03] <+Ixek> It's a shame, too. The multiplayer was fantastic. It just got drowned out by peoples understandable disappointment with REDBLUEGREEN.
[4:11:04] <Goraka91> Spartans are no joke
[4:11:05] <Vital_Ire> you're a 7' tall super soldier wolverine cyborg

[4:11:58] <RrenKrieg> but because he's a 8 foot tall strong alien
[4:11:58] <+Slipknotlobster> @maenos2, It has actually, right before we were introduced to him.
[4:11:59] <+Deyne_547> elites are 8ft tall
[4:11:59] <%DesDavis> Elites are almost as strong as Spartans
[4:12:00] <jorniev> ELITES

[4:12:16] <+phatmac16> ELITES are tough

[4:12:29] <+maenos2> @slipknotlobster I know the level is named as such but is it actually said because I sure didn't hear it.
[4:12:29] <%Firststrike_OW> You just told him not to play it
[4:12:30] <%ringabal> Tasked Failed succesfully
[4:12:31] <%BisoromiBear> Besides all this awful shit it's not too bad

[4:12:38] <+Sushi2k> Vindictus is good tbf
[4:12:39] <thetransagenda> uh oh

[4:12:42] <+MaddyCaddy> Yeah, Vindictus is korean
[4:12:42] <+phatmac16> Unsold
[4:12:43] <nothuzad> black deserts combat is nothing compared to vindicuts or pso2
[4:12:43] <%chiluzza> yeah but its RNG P2W shit as well
[4:12:43] <Raztron> Begone pleb
[4:12:44] <duskrush> It'll stab you when you put the disc in but the graphics are GREAT
[4:12:44] <%krispen_wa> The GIGABOTCH on the sell
[4:12:44] <+the_smiler_in_the_dark> it ain't pay to win at all
[4:12:45] <+Ixek> Black Desert is awful.
[4:12:45] <RahuHordika> Black desert has ultra grind tho
[4:12:45] <Reizie_Etherealm> Successfully failed
[4:12:46] <%prime_name> Oh yeah, Old Lady Casca

[4:13:02] <+maenos2> @slipknotlobster and given V didn't name it, I'm inclined to say no, don't name it

[4:13:53] <%Irridium> Yes
[4:13:54] <%prime_name> It is very fun!
[4:13:54] <Jashter18> Mine cant be said till the 3 stream but it's so good
[4:13:54] <+Aeriqui> Destiny lore is WILD
[4:13:55] <Joestar1890> YES
[4:13:55] <Vital_Ire> destiny is not as good
[4:13:57] <IndoorSitup> DESTINY SUCKS
[4:14:00] <%brachydios777> Yes
[4:14:01] <DCDrewZee> destiny lore is crazy af
[4:14:02] <jorniev> destiny 2 story is bad
[4:14:02] <mikesapartment> destiny tells not shows
[4:14:04] <%dekkitout> Halo's better than Destiny lore wise
[4:14:05] <+FennecZephyr> Destiny kinda sucks
[4:14:06] <Ardyn_1zunia> Sword Logic
[4:14:06] <+Aeriqui> Destiny lore is super super super wild
[4:14:07] <Goraka91> Destiny has the Halo gunplay but ehh
[4:14:07] <+novacrusader727> Yes!
[4:14:08] <+Invaderjaymz> Destiny Lore is crazy
[4:14:10] <kenny_biff> destiny "story" is nothing like halo
[4:14:12] <+maenos2> @slipknotlobster at the very least it should wait until more explanation in game. as I said, V didn't name it. I think that speaks volumes.
[4:14:13] <IndoorSitup> Destiny's storylines are BAAAAAD
[4:14:14] <DFireCreations> Destiny lore is amazing if you like to read
[4:14:14] <zocano> Destiny lore is fun
[4:14:15] <wiretapioca> PUwMP iT UP DOE
[4:14:15] <Catpurrple> Destiny is a through and through botchjob made by corporate meddling and a loss of talent.
[4:14:15] <%LiquidDinosaur> Destiny lore is cool Destiny the game sucks
[4:14:16] <%dekkitout> Destiny's aiight tho- Sword Logic's cool as shit
[4:14:16] <%RioGascar> Halos story is a blast CAUSE ITS SIMPLE
[4:14:17] <TheChucklingOak> PSO2 combat is, no offense intended, shit
[4:14:17] <%LiquidDinosaur> or, its OKAY
[4:14:18] <+armor_kuma> REAL difficult in a not fun way
[4:14:19] <Ynkubus_> You can do solo legendary or Reach
[4:14:19] <+cammertime22> Destiny has a good story but it's not as present in cutscenes as halos is
[4:14:19] <%kyh9> bleh
[4:14:19] <%Irridium> Destiny Lore is as good, actual Destiny story is not
[4:14:21] <DCDrewZee> Destiny is way better than okay
[4:14:21] <%Theycallmenerf> Spoiling something = you’re ruining genuine reactions and natural progression to said important narrative point.
[4:14:22] <Ardyn_1zunia> Lore is good. Story is bad
[4:14:22] <Garrison27> Destiny lore is cool Destiny story is shit
[4:14:23] <letshavecakes> Halo 2 legendary is what nightmares are made of
[4:14:23] <Goraka91> Destiny is currently getting invaded by evil traingles
[4:14:24] <+Aeriqui> The story is not in cutscenes
[4:14:25] <%jinking79> unless it halo 4
[4:14:27] <+Ixek> Heroic is a good difficulty for playing on.
[4:14:27] <mesamus> destiny lore is wild but the game story itself is pretty bad
[4:14:27] <CurrySauseBandit> Legendary is still pretty fun 9utside 9f sniper alley
[4:14:28] <%RioGascar> Destiny is trying to be complex
[4:14:28] <%prime_name> The story had no hooks
[4:14:28] <ZippierJosh> Custom games in halo is always hype
[4:14:28] <jorniev> DESTINY lore is better than its story
[4:14:29] <wiretapioca> Number 2
[4:14:30] <Firemane1279> Destiny's story is meh to me. it's a slog to wade through.
[4:14:33] <+MaddyCaddy> Isn't the story of one is two now?
[4:14:36] <%Slimshazbot> Destiny has amazing lore, but the ingame stories are fine
[4:14:37] <%Ancopro> yea it was borderline okay
[4:14:38] <FreedomARX7> the darkness fleet is here now tho
[4:14:39] <%krispen_wa> Destiny is Destiny
[4:14:42] <duskrush> It's free
[4:14:42] <zamzoph> THE DARKHNESS
[4:14:42] <+Invaderjaymz> Yeah Lore is way better than story
[4:14:43] <Torivore> Legendary solo is fine EXCEPT for 2 and CE kinda
[4:14:43] <gamewarden92> All that fucking buildup for Destiny to be OK.
[4:14:44] <ralphfromdk> Destiny does not live up to Halo... it's all about that loot grind and good gameplay, nothing else
[4:14:44] <%kyh9> Not Halo level then?
[4:14:44] <jorniev> JUST PLAY TITANFALL 2
[4:14:45] <+phatmac16> The story is boring
[4:14:46] <DCDrewZee> Nah, its good
[4:14:46] <nothuzad> TheChucklingOak I think he havent seen any high level gameplay then
[4:14:48] <+Aeoneth> As a Destiny fan... yeah that's fair
[4:14:48] <+Invaderjaymz> Destiny 2 is free.99
[4:14:49] <+Deyne_547> halo > Destiny
[4:14:51] <ScreamLord> Destiny 1 didn't get good until The Taken King was released
[4:14:51] <+phatmac16> The lore isn’t used well
[4:14:52] <DarkestDawn64> It's also free right now
[4:14:52] <+Tormenator1> The destiny lore is great,but the story is really not solid.
[4:14:54] <andresisant> Halo>destiny
[4:14:54] <%brachydios777> Activision had Bungie gut Destiny
[4:14:54] <TheChucklingOak> They lost all their story talent once they started the destiny series
[4:14:57] <+FennecZephyr> Destiny 2 is literally free, so play the Year 1 campaigns before they remove them
[4:14:59] <PlushMines> Destiny has great lore but bad storytelling
[4:14:59] <%dekkitout> Refer Woolie to Byf's videos
[4:15:00] <Pnutz409> Destiny is f2p
[4:15:04] <ghoulishcripple> by sale I assume V means its expansions
[4:15:05] <%Irridium> a shooter game with an end > a shooter game on an endless loot tredmill
[4:15:06] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @huskarl_zap
[4:15:09] <+Invaderjaymz> I wish Anthem wasn't a jank piece of shit lol
[4:15:10] <Catpurrple> Its the only feature they tested because it was all "EA Executive" wanted from it
[4:15:10] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Slimshazbot My problem is its like THIS IS A LITERAL GOD WHO HAS BENT PHYSICS AND DEVOURED GALAXIES: Go in a group of 3-6 people and shoot him with bullets"
[4:15:13] <Ardyn_1zunia> Destiny 2 is removing alot of the vanilla content in September. Possibly removing the main campaign too\
[4:15:13] <%notgarza> Anthem...
[4:15:13] <DesertPenguin> Just make it "not shit"
[4:15:14] <ZippierJosh> Destiny in game story is mediocre, the lore tho PogChamp
[4:15:14] <Goraka91> Moon's haunted doe
[4:15:19] <%notgarza> What could have been
[4:15:19] <Visorak6> destiny's story is shlock but the setting is gold because they'd been working on it for years
[4:15:21] <+NYCrownlessKing> I AGREE @WoolieVersus
[4:15:23] <Zouledge> Destiny is f2p exacerbate for the latest expansion iirc
[4:15:24] <+NYCrownlessKing> i loved the flying
[4:15:25] <+Aeriqui> destiny out of game lore is so damn good
[4:15:35] <%Deadpal> lmao
[4:15:35] <+NYCrownlessKing> and if i started up Anthem, i would just do it to fly lol
[4:15:36] <+Slipknotlobster> @maenos2, I don't think the level's name was the issue, I think it was the big visual spoiler that was the issue, especially since woolie will see the name when he loads the level back up next session before any more story drops.
[4:15:36] <bubbli97> LUL
[4:15:38] <%Firststrike_OW> LUL
[4:15:39] <%Slimshazbot> @LiquidDinosaur Yep, that too
[4:15:39] <mesamus> LUL
[4:15:44] <+TheShisno> REAL SHIT?
[4:15:44] <Pnutz409> @aeriqui that book of sorrows tho!!!
[4:15:47] <%dekkitout> Nothing hits harder than learning about Shin Malphur
[4:15:48] <+Invaderjaymz> ;D
[4:15:49] <+the_krypto_knight> Destiny might be good if the story was actually in the game
[4:15:50] <TheChucklingOak> If the background lore is good, but the actual story is bad, then I don't think it balances out
[4:15:50] <zocano> There are a lot of good short stories in Destiny’s “lore books” but the storytelling is... subpar
[4:15:54] <wiretapioca> Flood got the Lord's Sceptre
[4:15:57] <OldOnyx> Halo 1 legendary is being way overblown. Halo 2 legendary is annoying as all fuck
[4:15:57] <+Invaderjaymz> I need to buy a ps4
[4:15:57] <%brachydios777> #FUCKACTIVSION
[4:15:59] <%eggypigeon> yours not mine
[4:16:03] <DCDrewZee> @Slipknotlobster That too much thinking for the whiners
[4:16:05] <overlord_nico> They’d been working on destiny at least since ODST
[4:16:09] <no_johns_justin> destiny has amazing lore, too bad that its never used in its story in a meaningful way
[4:16:16] <Goraka91> @the_krypto_knight They might be doing that a bit more, evil triangles showed up
[4:16:20] <%Deadpal> this is not spoilers
[4:16:21] <+TheShisno> Covie-19
[4:16:25] <%Deadpal> this is within the story
[4:16:29] <%brachydios777> *I can not win with my spelling today
[4:16:30] <%DesDavis> Halo 2 legendary is legit broken
[4:16:40] <%prime_name> It could go either way really
[4:16:40] <Raztron> whats with this caution for Halo spoilers lol
[4:16:42] <%Irridium> this is one of them read between the lines things
[4:16:46] <mikesapartment> yeah they were probably on hold for him to get bopped
[4:16:46] <+Invaderjaymz> @no_johns_justin I feel like the dreaming city/last wish raid was the only HOLY SHIT in game moment
[4:16:47] <Raztron> its so simple
[4:16:54] <TheChucklingOak> Raztron, because Woolie is just starting out
[4:16:54] <%prime_name> Marines say Covies every so often
[4:17:01] <+Strelok608> woolie is the most overcautious person about spoilers in existence
[4:17:01] <lexcorphr> Regret was a false flag
[4:17:02] <%brachydios777> In game
[4:17:04] <DuckfishPrime> Halo 2 is the only one I did not complete on Legendary. Partly because I never actually owned 2.
[4:17:07] <UninstallWizard> Jackal snipers in Halo 2 on legendary @_@. I still have nightmares
[4:17:17] <+TheShisno> Much like religion
[4:17:20] <ghoulishcripple> i think Truth pulls back as early as he can without looking guilty
[4:17:26] <InugamiTheHound> Regret went to earlier and blew his load! hence why Mercy and Truth wanted him dead.
[4:17:32] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Slimshazbot also worth thinking about: the Hive are basically a more serious take on Orks in 40k. They feed on fighting and get stronger by killing and their gods are siblings with varying levels of brutality and cunning
[4:17:44] <ralphfromdk> Guilty Spark doesn't care WHY you wanna fire of the Halo, as long as you do it and the flood is beat when you do it
[4:17:45] <%subjectg> Either they are misinterpreting it or they forced the info out of him and are lying to you
[4:17:45] <TheChucklingOak> Who cares if someone is overcautious about spoliers, is it going to hurt you to follow their wishes?
[4:17:52] <huskarl_zap> flood have gods?
[4:17:57] <%prime_name> It's a bit of post-game story writing
[4:17:58] <Goraka91> ''Bro i'm a robot''
[4:17:59] <+Strelok608> no great journey was a covenant invention
[4:18:08] <+Strelok608> the forerunners only treated the rings as weapons
[4:18:09] <DarkestDawn64> Regret also says that the Oracles are unreliable
[4:18:10] <%brachydios777> @huskarl_zap They are the god
[4:18:12] <DFireCreations> Remember Spark explains this shit in a VERY roundabout way to chief in CE
[4:18:13] <TheChucklingOak> Just let people avoid spoilers,and stop using dumb excuses like "hurr durr it's an old game!"
[4:18:14] <%Irridium> "outbreak" "quarantine"
[4:18:16] <letshavecakes> The prophets wouldn't give a shit, they just got the information and then kept him stunned so he couldn't talk to anyone else
[4:18:24] <huskarl_zap> @brachydios777 ok
[4:18:25] <%Robot_Nixon_> MrDestructoid guilty spark fren MrDestructoid
[4:18:25] <JMCV22> I'm megaman
[4:18:31] <bleugh> or they believe what they want
[4:18:32] <Catpurrple> Interesting
[4:18:32] <Vital_Ire> uh wy not?
[4:18:32] <%prime_name> Never Keys
[4:18:39] <%krispen_wa> HUH?
[4:18:41] <mesamus> you can now V.....
[4:18:42] <wiretapioca> Wasn't that PATCHED?
[4:18:43] <IndoorSitup> @woo By the way, Destiny 1's original story that was written by the same dude who did the Halo trilogy was completely scrapped by Bungie higher ups because they thought the story was "too linear" so they had to come up with something completely new in under a year.
[4:18:44] <Joestar1890> Still no Keyes Terminal
[4:18:50] <alrobot2014> @wiretapioca nope
[4:18:53] <Vital_Ire> I don't really know what the keyes terminal would spoil now
[4:18:57] <DCDrewZee> What? V, it's perfectly fine to show the terminal at this point
[4:18:58] <%Slimshazbot> @Vital_Ire because they're wrapping up the stream
[4:18:58] <wiretapioca> wowy zowwy
[4:19:01] <ghoulishcripple> to be fair Spark thinks Chief knows about the rings, as hes a reclaimer
[4:19:01] <alrobot2014> @wiretapioca just harder since the game is at 60fps now

[4:19:10] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @wiretapioca IIRC it was patched, then people hated the game without it, so it was unpatched
[4:19:11] <%krispen_wa> They've already heard gravemind speak and know who miranda is
[4:19:11] <%subjectg> i think you guys have sworn them off the keyes terminal out of spite lol
[4:19:12] <+attackofthesage> The sword is the most important weapon in the speedrun

[4:19:32] <%Ancopro> but if you BOTH have swords
[4:19:35] <+Iamdenril> unless they also have a sword
[4:19:37] <huskarl_zap> if they clash you live

[4:20:02] <jorniev> you are overselling it
[4:20:05] <%prime_name> Oh, he's talking about the bomb punch
[4:20:06] <Lieutenant_America> You're not gonna convince them to love ME3 Multiplayer like this
[4:20:10] <mikesapartment> Obviously woolie has play me3
[4:20:13] <%GeneralSCPatton> @panicswytch They met gravemind
[4:20:17] <Lieutenant_America> And I loved that multiplayer
[4:20:17] <%RioGascar> Oh man woolie isnt gonna see energy sword clashs
[4:20:20] <Dean_Inbetween> Oh boy i hope woolie plays halo 3 multiplayer because theres sword clashing and parries

[4:20:23] <Catpurrple> Yeah, get in on that dead game's multiplayer, absolutely
[4:20:25] <korth367> clooe popopall
[4:20:31] <huskarl_zap> GET IN BR 4 SHOT boiiiiiiiis
[4:20:34] <%LiquidDinosaur> I warned you about stairs bro
[4:20:35] <IndoorSitup> @woolieversus By the way, Destiny 1's original story that was written by the same dude who did the Halo trilogy was completely scrapped by Bungie higher ups because they thought the story was "too linear" so they had to come up with something completely new in under a year.
[4:20:35] <duskrush> I've never seen stairs in a Covenant ship
[4:20:36] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:20:40] <DarkestDawn64> All the covenant ships have ramps
[4:20:41] <$Rumbutt> Elites hate ladders
[4:20:42] <Divryne> SWOLE PROTOCOL.
[4:20:42] <%BisoromiBear> all about them ramps
[4:20:42] <+barrakuta371> That was ladders, not stairs!
[4:20:43] <%ringabal> I warned you about stairs, Arbiter!
[4:20:44] <%brachydios777> LUL
[4:20:44] <duskrush> They're all ramps
[4:20:47] <Reizie_Etherealm> No stairs, only lifts and inclines
[4:20:48] <Ardyn_1zunia> THESE STAIRS HAVE NO HONOR
[4:20:49] <Ynkubus_> ramps or lifts, stairs are for hoomans
[4:20:50] <wiretapioca> Woolie should play through Modern Warfare 1 & 2 if he's feelin this way about this blockbuster series
[4:20:56] <Dante_Namikaze1> When in Human environments they have to use stairs
[4:20:58] <jorniev> PURPLE
[4:21:01] <any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> alien cities in halo are just human cities but purple
[4:21:03] <ghoulishcripple> stairs bring shame upon us
[4:21:06] <+phatmac16> Stairs are elites biggest weakness
[4:21:07] <InugamiTheHound> in halo books the prophets used gravity seats to get around. They are fat and lazy
[4:21:10] <+Slipknotlobster> It's ladders not stairs.
[4:21:13] <%subjectg> You know i never thought about the lack of stairs in covie society
[4:21:15] <+Strelok608> Scarabs are the same thing as hunters
[4:21:18] <+Strelok608> jsut even bigger
[4:21:18] <StarlitStunner> lytBLUSH Worms
[4:21:19] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Lieutenant_America
[4:21:25] <%LiquidDinosaur> @ringabal Sweet Brute and Hella Jiralhanae?
[4:21:30] <%subjectg> i guess abraham lincoln wasn’t there to invent stairs for them
[4:21:34] <+THE_CYB3R_FOX> Woolie you got hype to kill Regret but you do realize you punched the shit out of an old man in a wheelchair
[4:21:37] <Ardyn_1zunia> Elites served the prophets because the prophets lent them tech to get around having to evolve to walk up stairs
[4:21:51] <Catpurrple> Yep
[4:21:52] <+Iamdenril> YO
[4:21:52] <alrobot2014> yep

[4:21:58] <%LiquidDinosaur> @THE_CYB3R_FOX hey man Regret was armed with a plasma pistol he was asking for it
[4:21:58] <RahuHordika> Not the ones in 2
[4:21:58] <+in_spaaace> true
[4:21:59] <+FactualAdam> Yep, you see it in Halo 3
[4:21:59] <SableDragoon> yes
[4:22:00] <%raven_frame> It is.
[4:22:00] <%Ancopro> i never knew that
[4:22:01] <+einherjarvalk> you can see it in 3
[4:22:03] <Vital_Ire> Well they *drive* it, but they aren't the machine parts.
[4:22:04] <Divryne> It's correct.
[4:22:06] <%brachydios777> This is true

[4:22:12] <AThing_> Didn't know that
[4:22:14] <Catpurrple> I don't know if they had that lore in 2, but it's absolutely proven for 3
[4:22:14] <+phatmac16> Yup
[4:22:14] <wiretapioca> We WORMZ NOW
[4:22:15] <%subjectg> The one in 2 is a mining platform, but...
[4:22:16] <%Robot_Nixon_> everything is worms
[4:22:17] <Ynkubus_> The one in 2 is a mining unit version
[4:22:17] <+Iamdenril> become worm bois
[4:22:17] <%raven_frame> The worms are tech.
[4:22:20] <turbofolk> Rock, Metal & Time
[4:22:21] <RahuHordika> The one in 2 is a normal vehicle
[4:22:22] <%BisoromiBear> everything is worms
[4:22:23] <$Rumbutt> OH WORM?
[4:22:24] <%dekkitout> Worms fix everything
[4:22:25] <vulkan_vibes> yes

[4:22:36] <Vital_Ire> yeah but it's not just all worms though, TBH it's just who drives it, not that it's all worms, it's still mechanical
[4:22:37] <+Slipknotlobster> They are in 3, in 2 they're just a vehicle:
[4:22:38] <huskarl_zap> I thought in this is where shooting the core came from

[4:22:53] <zerohefrost> That is true, it totally is

[4:23:05] <DesertPenguin> Plasma Pristols
[4:23:05] <wiretapioca> WHAT
[4:23:07] <+Strelok608> bruh plasma pistol is the most necessary gun in the game
[4:23:07] <OldManDeckardCain> why are you so guncist woolie? Kappa
[4:23:09] <+lupus_man> @woolieversus hunters also can’t talk normally they just vibrate their worms to imitate speech
[4:23:11] <%brachydios777> That’s how da video games be
[4:23:14] <vulkan_vibes> the covenant have no ai processing. they use hunter worms whi h are straight up synapsrs
[4:23:17] <%Firststrike_OW> Youre not alone in that
[4:23:17] <wiretapioca> THey underestimate the potential
[4:23:18] <zerohefrost> It’s a worm colony
[4:23:23] <Reizie_Etherealm> FIREPOWER, I need more firepower!
[4:23:32] <+phatmac16> @subjectg You can transfer your soul into worms so it’s pretty crazy besides the rape stuff
[4:23:32] <mesamus> plasma pistols get better in latter games cause of the emp disable on vehicles
[4:23:35] <OldOnyx> plasma pistols suck in 2 :(
[4:23:38] <DesertPenguin> These are the same worms from Futurama that infected Fry's intestine
[4:23:46] <%brachydios777> Plasma pistols are only good for shield pop combo
[4:23:49] <wiretapioca> PLASMA WIT da BR, Guudnacht Buddy
[4:23:50] <CiaraRoses> If only woolie knew the power of plasma pistol + headshot weapon
[4:23:51] <+deadeyemax> the guns are balanced for multiplayed not campaign
[4:23:51] <DesertPenguin> Plasma Rifle
[4:23:53] <DesertPenguin> It's inaccurate
[4:23:55] <+Strelok608> in 3 plasma pistols are necessary bcause one overcharge strips a brute
[4:23:56] <InugamiTheHound> plasma pistols are good to take out shields. The pistol with plasma pistol is a good combo IMO
[4:23:56] <IndoorSitup> Dual Wielding kinda gimped the weapon balance in Halo
[4:23:57] <+Detectivemac9> yeah i don't like the plasma pistol but you really need it in campaign
[4:23:59] <TheChucklingOak> thats whats fun, sometimes havig to make do with only bad weaponns
[4:24:01] <%prime_name> That hurts my childhood
[4:24:03] <ShutterSnap> I cannot express how happy i am with seeing woolie play through halo 2 (and halo CE from before)
[4:24:03] <%subjectg> @phatmac16 you know what, fair
[4:24:10] <PanicSwytch> They get better in other games
[4:24:12] <%raven_frame> My poor sweet summer child, not knowing the misery of not having a plasma pistol when you need it most.

[4:25:04] <TheChucklingOak> They're 5'6 lobster gorillas, they're stronger than you think
[4:25:05] <zocano> The problem with the dual wield weapons is that they’re balanced around dual wielding
[4:25:05] <wiretapioca> Beats (by Dre) AKIMBO
[4:25:08] <DianaTheAscian> aren't grunts like 5 feet tall?
[4:25:09] <+disgruntledgruntle> :(
[4:25:15] <Vital_Ire> Hey wools been a fan for a while, glad to see you playing halo 2, it's my fav halo, and after seeing you guys go through kotor 2 I've been pretty pleased lately, hope you enjoy where it goes, also for the record, the hunters don't make up the entire scarab, just drive it, and only in 3, in 2 it's just an AT-AT
[4:25:16] <%Irridium> Grunts are almost 6 feet tall
[4:25:32] <Halospaz117> You point and they die
[4:25:36] <ghoulishcripple> you think you could box out a grunt?

[4:26:02] <wiretapioca> YES
[4:26:03] <Raztron> Plebian
[4:26:03] <%hoopray> Reach is overrated
[4:26:03] <%augusm> WRONG
[4:26:03] <VidulaSaix> I love 2
[4:26:04] <Catpurrple> Sure
[4:26:05] <wiretapioca> Thank you V
[4:26:06] <%Firststrike_OW> 2 then 3
[4:26:06] <DeltaD36> 2 is better than reach TBH
[4:26:06] <Bail_seven> v wrong
[4:26:07] <DCDrewZee> Reach destroys all of them, no way
[4:26:07] <%augusm> But okay
[4:26:08] <Dante_Namikaze1> Reach then 3
[4:26:09] <+Sushi2k> It is Heresy then
[4:26:09] <%prime_name> They're all good man
[4:26:09] <%Slimshazbot> Reach is great but campaign is... eh
[4:26:09] <pochecito> You take that back!
[4:26:12] <jorniev> NO WAY MAN REACH
[4:26:12] <Dean_Inbetween> Halo 3 is best halo
[4:26:12] <Turtleomertle> 3, 2 , reach
[4:26:12] <Catpurrple> I prefer how 3 feels to play a lot more
[4:26:13] <+serpenttucker> I respect your opinion but you are WRONG
[4:26:14] <Raztron> 2 is Incomplete!
[4:26:16] <+attackofthesage> Reach is absolutely overrated imo
[4:26:16] <%eggypigeon> ODST FTW BOYS
[4:26:16] <Reizie_Etherealm> But be careful about aim with the BR, the bro rifle can becoem the bruh rifle LUL
[4:26:17] <correctedsun117> ODST is best
[4:26:21] <%prime_name> ODST is my personal favorite
[4:26:22] <+Williamld> Reach is the same tier as 5
[4:26:23] <%krispen_wa> DAMN CENTRIST WITH NO OPINIONS
[4:26:23] <+ygernesfeld> Where does ODST rank on this list, V?
[4:26:23] <+Mondeiya> playing 3 after halo 2's glow up is wild
[4:26:23] <zocano> 3 is best Halo
[4:26:24] <+Invaderjaymz> Halo Reach is amazing, from campaign to multiplayer!
[4:26:25] <%brachydios777> Reach is pretty great
[4:26:25] <+CyanDeadEye> Why does Halo 3 MP feel off in the MCC?
[4:26:26] <Raztron> and balanced ONLY for Multiplayer
[4:26:28] <+chunkyfranku> 3 ODST IS THE BEST HALO
[4:26:29] <%raven_frame> ODST > Reach
[4:26:30] <%eggypigeon> gimmme that jazz
[4:26:30] <+Iamdenril> i really liked the smg in odst
[4:26:32] <DesertPenguin> I never played after Halo 2, because I had a PS3 and not an XBOX360
[4:26:33] <+Wootwi> @WoolieVersus are you guys gonna be playing Halo 3 4 player Co-oP?
[4:26:35] <+phatmac16> Don’t get why people hate Reach
[4:26:36] <TheChucklingOak> Damn you with your personal opinions!
[4:26:36] <+Invaderjaymz> But 3 is also a masterpiece
[4:26:38] <ghoulishcripple> feet first into hell! ODST!
[4:26:39] <Torivore> V continuing to be wrong about Halo
[4:26:44] <+zombinedotrar> ODST > 2 > 3 # 4 > Reach > CE > 5
[4:26:45] <%subjectg> I honestly say that Reach is my fav
[4:26:55] <InugamiTheHound> halo 4 SP mode is good but MP is bad. While halo 5 has terrible SP and good MP mode
[4:27:01] <iamtheTwitchghost> PogChamp
[4:27:02] <jorniev> WHAAAA
[4:27:03] <+bronin2099> Hating Reach is the cool thing to do now I see
[4:27:04] <+freelancer_960> campaign wise it's ODST, 4, 2, 3, 5, CE for me

[0:00:15] <ralphfromdk> Dooooooooom !!!!! :D
[0:00:23] <Hawkbone_> TIme for another Slayer Testament study session guys.
[0:00:51] <%Irridium> Damn Into the Breach's soundtrack was so fucking good
[0:01:12] <Hawkbone_> FTL's soundtrack was also damn good
[0:01:39] <%Solidnick18> woolieCHAN
[0:01:43] <%FuqBoiSlim> LETS FUCCKIN GOOOOOOOOO woolieCHAN woolieCHAN woolieCHAN woolieCHAN woolieCHAN
[0:01:48] <Hawkbone_> Wonder what those guys are doing nowadays. Into the Breach was 2016, right? You'd think they'd have a new game by now
[0:02:03] <fist_wizard_jay> Today at 1 PM: DOOOOOOOOOOOM
[0:02:27] <+Hutchy9001> Heyoo
[0:02:37] <BlackermanZX> DOOOOOM doodCrazy
[0:02:37] <Tucker0603> damnit woolz, I'm taking an exam in an hour T^T
[0:02:41] <+Javaa01> I mean, the gap between FTL and Into The Breach was 4 years
[0:02:43] <$GoogleyGareth> DOOOOOM
[0:02:43] <+Nobrev> Yeyeyeyeye DOOM
[0:02:46] <Vyneci> DOOM
[0:02:47] <+Javaa01> So they definitely take their time
[0:02:51] <+TheNeonGraveyard> RIP AND TEAR UNTIL IT IS DONE
[0:03:16] <Hawkbone_> I can't wait to see Woolie fight HIM.
[0:03:30] <%GeneralSCPatton> Anyone know how many levels until the next part of the Doomslayer's Testament?
[0:03:38] <SilverInferno3> Okay so quick question for yall DOOMheads: What's the best place to read up on the confirmed lore in a straight-forward way? I saw some people arguing on interpretations on various things and I want to get things straight
[0:03:44] <%lewdskeletor13> lewdskeletor13 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Yo Woolie, loving the content lately, feels like you guys and the channel have found your groove so to speak. Gonna play Doom Eternal too?
[0:03:48] <+DesertPenguin> Something is wrong with Twitch. I can't access chat while watching the stream
[0:03:53] <+Javaa01> The next testament shows up when you go to hell again
[0:04:06] <Ordinary_Who> Aw shiet
[0:04:08] <Hawkbone_> @SilverInferno3 Get all the codex's in the game and read it there.
[0:04:14] <Ordinary_Who> WE DOOM BOIS NOW!!!
[0:04:32] <thestrongbadman> how's doom been going?
[0:04:40] <+DesertPenguin> What's wrong with Twitch ugh....
[0:04:47] <%GeneralSCPatton> @javaa01 I assumed that, but I don't remember how long it takes to get back to the ol' Inferno.
[0:04:50] <%Solidnick18> SourPls
[0:05:06] <+Nobrev> SourPls
[0:05:07] <Hawkbone_> @GeneralSCPatton You go back to Hell right after fighting...him...
[0:05:11] <@Solidus_113> redliiiiiiiiiiiine
[0:05:14] <Captain_Aham> Redline baby
[0:05:15] <$GoogleyGareth> SourPls
[0:05:18] <%Solidnick18> Redlinnnnnneeeeeeee
[0:05:21] <SilverInferno3> @Hawkbone_ Does that include the lore for the old games? Since I know some of them are canon
[0:05:21] <@Menitta> redliiiiiiiine
[0:05:21] <+Javaa01> @GeneralSCPatton There's one level before we go to hell again
[0:05:27] <%lewdskeletor13> So apparently Doom Eternal will give a definitive answer on if Doom Slayer is the original Doom Guy woolieYE
[0:05:28] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:05:45] <Hawkbone_> @SilverInferno3 The old games barely have any lore, any that they tried to create, like the books, aren't canon.
[0:06:01] <+Javaa01> Then after that romp in hell, we get my favorite level in the game
[0:06:13] <+Javaa01> And after that, the ending level
[0:06:36] <SilverInferno3> @Hawkbone_ Gotcha, thanks. There was some intense debate on stuff like the Betrayer and Sentinels and shit and I was so confused lol, I should go through that codex again
[0:06:36] <Hawkbone_> There's surprisingly few actual levels in this game but they're all fookin HUGE
[0:06:42] <+DesertPenguin> There's two levels after hell, one is kinda short though
[0:06:55] <+DesertPenguin> You have to do that stuff to backup VEGA and then the final level
[0:07:06] <+QueequegTheater> That Patrat is fucking perfect
[0:07:25] <ihateyouo> DDOM
[0:07:29] <ihateyouo> DOOM
[0:07:34] <+RadiantFalconGV> DOOM
[0:07:36] <+QueequegTheater> DDOS
[0:07:39] <+thackattack00> DOOM
[0:07:44] <%lewdskeletor13> “So then I started ripping and tearing”
[0:07:46] <%Solidnick18> RIP AND DOOM
[0:07:49] <Hawkbone_> After he finishes this game, how long until he gets to H-DOOM?

[0:12:22] <%FuqBoiSlim> damn none of my friends give a shit about dmc
[0:12:23] <@Squdnate> I hope these changes to DMC3 also gets into the other versions, aka. PC, PS4 etc.
[0:12:27] <+cherrypiestealer> Are we just waiting for the Dante announcement for pack 6
[0:12:38] <%BusterRepukken> what was the last DMC3 change
[0:12:39] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:12:49] <BallerSwagBro9k> @Squdnate I hope so. But they didnt do it for DRagon Quest
[0:12:51] <@Menitta> Still waiting on Vergil in 5
[0:13:01] <+QueequegTheater> For as much as people love to say one or the other is better, I bet Master Chief and Doomguy would actually get along pretty well
[0:13:01] <%lewdskeletor13> woolieFABRICATION
[0:13:01] <+OnyxMemory> if I had to guess. dmc5se on next gen with vergil dlc and full coop features like bp coop

[0:20:49] <+QueequegTheater> @SoaringLettuce Just making the budget back isn't breaking even, you need to make 2.5 times
[0:20:50] <peanutbutteroven> I liked monster Sonic

[0:20:59] <+OnyxMemory> @woolieversus you hyped about that bloody palace dante +vergil coop?
[0:21:03] <mistersups> I think word of mouth will save it, but it won't do super well.
[0:21:06] <SoaringLettuce> everyone saying its a failure is pretending only @queequegtheater were one weekend in
[0:21:07] <%gatorafan> I mean, I still think he's fugly. Just not nightmare inducing
[0:21:09] <%Solidnick18> Sonic i might
[0:21:09] <dekkitout> Is sonic out yet?
[0:21:09] <%Irridium> I'll be real I didn't even know Birds of Prey came out. Not great marketing
[0:21:11] <+mechslayer71> The floss dance tho
[0:21:15] <+Estuko> @OnyxMemory it's so fun
[0:21:15] <SteinsApprentice> vidyagames movie
[0:21:16] <Guyshane> Birds of Prey is great
[0:21:17] <@Solidus_113> Sonic is out tomorrow
[0:21:18] <+linSP> do you think theyll have beta sonic on the blueray release
[0:21:25] <a_mad_dragon> sonic is probably that highly rated because everyone set the bar for it so low
[0:21:36] <SoaringLettuce> @queequegtheater i was already writing something nevermind the first part
[0:21:37] <%GeneralSCPatton> @naturalgear You aren't welcome here with that kind of talk
[0:21:39] <dekkitout> Galentine? Pretty sure that's a sword in warframe
[0:21:43] <+RadiantFalconGV> @Irridium almost like WB's not confident in it

[0:25:13] <+QueequegTheater> Thanks for the LuvSign @boxofhooligans
[0:25:15] <SilverInferno3> Plot that matters? In a fiighting game? What?
[0:25:25] <%boxofhooligans> Being in front of the monitor of the action on doom feels more excilarating (dont think that i spelled that right)
[0:25:30] <+SirGO0SE> 21 Kreygasm
[0:25:48] <+QueequegTheater> Okay but does this character check of the three dozen fetish boxes that 21 does
[0:25:50] <%boxofhooligans> @queequegtheater NP!
[0:25:55] <+sugardaddyvoid> @mechslayer71 I like mnk but wasn’t sure if it was more optimized or maybe would be more fun On a bigger scream. Can’t figure out where’d I’d wanna play
[0:26:17] <+SirGO0SE> that evo hockey jersey is fresh as fuck
[0:26:30] <+mechslayer71> @sugardaddyvoid you’ll have to wait for reviews to hear about optimization
[0:26:49] <SilverInferno3> Not rumors anymore

[0:27:49] <+Freelance7> GUNSWORDTRICK
[0:27:49] <%RioGascar> So no care
[0:27:51] <+Javaa01> Or mod the PC version to get active style switching
[0:27:53] <+QueequegTheater> Won't this make 3 way easier?

[0:28:22] <SilverInferno3> Better question is are these exclusive to Switch or is it coming to the ps4 version I bought a month before they announced all this
[0:28:26] <quasiplaying> @WoolieVersus Have you played the Mobile/PC game Honkai Impact 3rd? And are you excited about the game coming up Genshin Impact coming out for the switch?
[0:28:26] <SoaringLettuce> 3 is gonna be bitch easy
[0:28:28] <%RioGascar> who cares about za lore implications
[0:28:29] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus On PC there is a style switch mod
[0:28:53] <sonofthedeepsouth> IN THE FIRST MEME
[0:28:54] <%RioGascar> i am wondering why they are doing this
[0:28:57] <%RioGascar> When dmc5 is out
[0:28:59] <unit24> I feel like 3 is going to be easier but also a lot more fun
[0:28:59] <sonofthedeepsouth> IN THE FIRST SHITPOST
[0:29:08] <%RioGascar> like...i will never go back to dmc3 now
[0:29:10] <SilverInferno3> I seriously doubt it'll break the game or anything, if Vergil wrecks you before the updates he'll still wreck you with the updates
[0:29:15] <%RioGascar> not when dmc5 exists
[0:29:27] <%boxofhooligans> Cause Dante for smash! and DMC 3 good game.
[0:29:28] <fairore> @riogascar it's for the switch dude cmonBruh
[0:29:33] <%Solidnick18> that's pretty cool
[0:29:40] <SilverInferno3> Ah yeah that's true, Co-op was already baked in there
[0:29:40] <G_Lancaster> @RioGascar i mean, people like it, it's not that hard and they're already releasing a new version anyway
[0:29:43] <+heartbbyy> dmc 5 is so much harder on dmd

[0:59:24] <+QueequegTheater> @1matheuw he had the points
[0:59:26] <Lophostrix_> pistol is the best weapon stfu
[0:59:26] <$GoogleyGareth> regular shotgun's good for saving ammo and the grenade launcher
[0:59:27] <stanlychicken> Do pistol only
[0:59:32] <SilverInferno3> I mean its fine but there were better places to invest
[0:59:34] <junkyardangel> "So i've done a little grinding"
[0:59:38] <BlackermanZX> eh completed pistol can be useful
[0:59:40] <+JD0394> Maxed pistol is good on pc
[0:59:46] <%WhackyChiraqi> WhackyChiraqi subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! C O O M
[0:59:48] <NaturalGear> maxed super shotgun is really good
[0:59:51] <SilverInferno3> But why stun when you can SIEGE
[0:59:51] <+thotacon_tv> seige mode is life
[0:59:51] <fist_wizard_jay> Wow Woolie it looks like you went and got real HUGE
[0:59:59] <+Capta1n_H3nry> Thanks for the LuvCool @whackychiraqi
[0:59:59] <+QueequegTheater> @SilverInferno3 No there aren't, Siege Mode and Mobile turret are by far the best in the game
[1:00:02] <+ill_sage> pistol got mad ass disease
[1:00:03] <Daxalog> Pistol Stun for Rescources
[1:00:04] <+captain_elsewhere> i only upgrade the pistol for the challenge in that one level
[1:00:05] <+TheDankDemon> you can fly tho
[1:00:09] <%Solidnick18> but big gun fun
[1:00:09] <%FuqBoiSlim> just get headshots all the time 4Head
[1:00:10] <primaryfire> people who use the pistol are victims of stockholm syndrome
[1:00:11] <+QueequegTheater> NUMBER GO UP
[1:00:21] <chromdad> Use gun on demon
[1:00:23] <%Aeoneth> Pistol only good for staggering weak enemies
[1:00:25] <jorniev> yeah but you have to not upgared all the other shit
[1:00:33] <@Solidus_113> All movement comes from gauss
[1:00:37] <SilverInferno3> @QueequegTheater Still more fun stuff than the pistol
[1:00:42] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus The high level strat is a specific rune combination that gives you infinite mobile turret ammo
[1:00:44] <fist_wizard_jay> tbh
[1:00:45] <gustavozxd> highest level strat = shoot demons
[1:00:53] <ThousandDogs> Until they die

[1:01:21] <%Solidnick18> woolieLORE
[1:01:35] <%WhackyChiraqi> I'm secretly hoping that Doom: Eternal reveals that the Doomslayer is actually either Jesus Christ of Nazereth, or a direct descendent
[1:01:38] <b_ikki> 25 a month
[1:01:38] <+captain_elsewhere> whad difficulty is this ?
[1:01:43] <+p4ntless> the pistol is kinda just there if you want to use it, it has no real practical purpose when every other weapon also has practically infinite ammo too
[1:01:45] <Vyneci> Normal

[1:01:48] <%BusterRepukken> @WhackyChiraqi itsOG Doomguy

[1:14:02] <%WhackyChiraqi> The [B]elieving [F]or [G]od Gun
[1:14:02] <primaryfire> gotta upgrade the celestial brush
[1:14:04] <%jinking79> I LOVE THE BFG IT SO BAD
[1:14:04] <clonexsniperx> we are orks?

[1:14:11] <+TheDankDemon> METAL
[1:14:11] <SilverInferno3> Well I think "faith" means "willingness to die"
[1:14:11] <mistersups> 40k
[1:14:11] <derap41> 40K Warp again
[1:14:16] <dekkitout> I think faith = power was a thing in a Thor comic run

[1:14:49] <+chiluzza> RED WUNS GO FASTA
[1:14:51] <%Solidnick18> that's cool
[1:14:51] <+Javaa01> Ork tech in 40k DOESN'T work, but it DOES because they ALL think it works
[1:14:52] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus And it only works because they're too stupid to realize that it shouldn't work
[1:14:52] <Hawkbone_> They have powerful psionic abilities.
[1:14:52] <b_ikki> not false
[1:14:54] <derap41> Even just the normal warp is controlled by belief and emotion
[1:14:58] <Tyrrosh> ever seen an purple orc?
[1:15:01] <+kyh9> They don't understand engines, so they sit in carts and they start to become powered
[1:15:04] <%WhackyChiraqi> They also inadverdently made the Human Emperor Immortal because they THINK he can't die
[1:15:06] <+SirGO0SE> never knew that, thats rad as fuck
[1:15:07] <jarednotwithsubway> What!? That’s fuckin sick
[1:15:07] <dekkitout> Even though red is a lower frequency color
[1:15:10] <derap41> DAKKA!
[1:15:11] <+captain_elsewhere> red is faster, blue is sneaky, black is tougher and yellow is more expensive
[1:15:11] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @chiluzza
[1:15:12] <+QueequegTheater> GORK AND MORK

[1:20:59] <peachy996> Impact Compensation
[1:21:03] <@Solidus_113> it gives you health
[1:21:08] <%Aeoneth> it heals you

[1:21:34] <BlackermanZX> life drain grenade

[1:21:57] <SilverInferno3> Pinkie's got armor in the front!
[1:21:59] <+thesyndrome> @WoolieVersus the greande steals life from enemies and gives it to you
[1:22:08] <peachy996> he had armor
[1:22:10] <BallerSwagBro9k> @ThousandDogs Hes sadi it like 500 times

[1:23:14] <Hawkbone_> I think its just this one arena fight and then you fight him
[1:23:21] <Hawkbone_> Could be wrong
[1:23:36] <stanlychicken> Isn't that a spoiler?
[1:23:46] <SilverInferno3> I mean it wouldn't mean much to him
[1:23:46] <+PriorityDrelb> Whole bunch of level left
[1:23:49] <%WhackyChiraqi> to think Dante and Vergil are somewhere around here
[1:23:53] <masterfire23> can't wait for Woolz to start doing crazy trickshots and gauss jumping LUL
[1:24:24] <ThousandDogs> Target in the center, pull the switch.
[1:24:46] <%WhackyChiraqi> does doomslayer poop
[1:24:56] <+thesyndrome> don't forget your BFG in a pinch
[1:25:00] <SilverInferno3> Only if it's in a demon's cereal
[1:25:41] <+CounterBeard> some good squishy noises in this game
[1:25:53] <ThousandDogs> The foley art in this game is phenomenal.
[1:26:02] <Hawkbone_> The foley artists really earned their paycheck here
[1:26:03] <vincerocmm> he was puched so haed he became a door
[1:26:07] <+Javaa01> Through the green door
[1:26:33] <@Solidus_113> enemies are usually progression
[1:26:53] <SilverInferno3> See Jessica for sick hell powers
[1:27:00] <+thesyndrome> oh man, imagine if you volunteered for the revenant program
[1:27:03] <Bailey__gaming> needs more iddqd
[1:27:10] <+Javaa01> Jessica will hook you up with a SICK jetpack
[1:27:22] <ThousandDogs> Be all that you can be as a revanant in the UACF
[1:27:28] <ThousandDogs> Would you like to know more?
[1:27:32] <%RioGascar> Hey woolie sell out humanity
[1:27:39] <%RioGascar> you may get killed by demons
[1:27:41] <%RioGascar> Buttttttt
[1:27:47] <%WhackyChiraqi> Imagine agreeing to turn into a demon, when the dude who BEAT UP HELL THREE TIMES is like, downstairs
[1:27:53] <%RioGascar> maybe they’ll turn you into a jetpack boi
[1:28:03] <vincerocmm> killchip
[1:28:04] <whazat> they all died when the demons showed up
[1:28:07] <%GeneralSCPatton> THAT BITCH
[1:28:07] <CoffeeSlice> :C
[1:28:08] <BlackermanZX> Becoming a Revenant only would be worth if you become the DOOT
[1:28:15] <Quent0nius> what a bitch
[1:28:26] <+Javaa01> Yeah, swapping mods is the last priority
[1:28:36] <Hawkbone_> Would you become a revenant? On one hand, sick jetpack with rocket launchers, on the other hand, you are forced to painfully become Paigebait
[1:28:40] <ThousandDogs> I'm pretty sure Olivia Pierce shut them all down when they started fighting Hell.
[1:28:42] <%WhackyChiraqi> Welcome to this wild Savannah, would you like to wear this sweater made out of delicious steaks?
[1:28:45] <%HollowedIdjit> yeah they didn't go 0-2, they got shot in the back on their way to the set
[1:28:55] <ThousandDogs> They're too in-tact to have been killed by demons.
[1:29:02] <+captain_elsewhere> betray your friends and family: fabulous prizes to be won
[1:29:05] <SilverInferno3> She wasn't a sick robot like you Sam
[1:29:08] <Bailey__gaming> oh did woolie find one of old doom 93 maps that are secrets in some levels
[1:29:24] <%Irridium> remote detonation is pretty good
[1:29:31] <%Aeoneth> Remote Det is real good
[1:29:32] <+tearknack> he found some, @Bailey__gaming
[1:29:33] <@Solidus_113> Remote has good buffs
[1:29:41] <SilverInferno3> I like Remote better than Lock on tbh
[1:29:45] <Hawkbone_> He found all of them so far, only one or two on stream
[1:29:46] <%Aeoneth> Shoot then Alt-Fire
[1:30:02] <SilverInferno3> Useful for Pinkies
[1:30:08] <+p4ntless> kills pinkies real good
[1:30:08] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:30:13] <%Irridium> it is NOT Woolie proof
[1:30:20] <SilverInferno3> Also good for Shield fuckers
[1:30:30] <%WhackyChiraqi> !motivated
[1:30:31] <@Moobot> 639 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[1:30:32] <DeadpanSoupcan> so good
[1:30:42] <+captain_elsewhere> MOTIVATED doodTerror
[1:30:47] <%Irridium> last one is basically two rockets in one. Pop it just before it hits and then the rocket will hit after. 2 in 1
[1:30:51] <SilverInferno3> Lessens damage, not negate it tho
[1:30:55] <ThousandDogs> USE IT AS A MELEE WEAPON WOOLZ
[1:31:05] <+OneGorillionDollars> @WoolieVersus remote detonation is good because if fully upgraded and you detonate right before you hit you essentially get double damage
[1:31:37] <Hawkbone_> What do you guys think is the most fuckable demon in this game?
[1:31:46] <%WhackyChiraqi> @Hawkbone_ yes

[1:38:58] <+Javaa01> Lock-on is not a part of this challenge
[1:39:05] <@Solidus_113> it's what you have for the challenge
[1:39:06] <%Haarute> challenge decides.
[1:39:06] <Hawkbone_> You don't have a choice in rune trials
[1:39:08] <+captain_elsewhere> you are stuck with remote
[1:39:09] <+Javaa01> Remote Detonator is forced on this challenge
[1:39:10] <Vyneci> You only have remote detonator for this
[1:39:12] <+thackattack00> you cant switch
[1:39:12] <%BusterRepukken> you dont get a choice

[1:40:00] <peachy996> Reasonable assumption
[1:40:03] <SilverInferno3> All mods are L2 boyo
[1:40:09] <ralphfromdk> Biggest enemy of the doomslaver is him self.
[1:40:13] <@Solidus_113> depth is hard
[1:40:14] <peachy996> On any other game, it would be R2 twice
[1:40:18] <+A123yourdead> Hahahahahahahaha
[1:40:23] <%cherrypiestealer> CANT WAIT FOR HIM TO SEE THE INVISIBLE PINKYS
[1:40:27] <RyanTheRecluse> Also I don’t think you have reduced self damage for the trial
[1:40:27] <awalr> the mod is on the mod button? how can this be
[1:40:33] <%FuqBoiSlim> just dont get hit 4Head
[1:40:34] <@Solidus_113> the game is teaching you to not get hit for the rune

[1:41:32] <fist_wizard_jay> yeyeye
[1:41:34] <+Javaa01> It's not a melee weapon
[1:41:38] <TheyCallMeVawn> Footsies woolie
[1:41:44] <NekoZen> its an explosive rocket
[1:41:44] <%WhackyChiraqi> to be fair it's a rocket you need to get really close to them
[1:41:47] <gunsrlove> Woolie is touching himself enough with this rocket lawnchair
[1:41:52] <jorniev> keep away woolie
[1:41:54] <+OmegaWeltall> Too close to Dylan
[1:41:54] <vincerocmm> rocketman
[1:41:54] <%WhackyChiraqi> rocket launchers are notorious for their tiny range
[1:42:04] <+rider_megalon> try aiming better
[1:42:05] <%jepupu> Remote det has larger AoE I think
[1:42:05] <fist_wizard_jay> TooCloseMan
[1:42:05] <rubbishbinge> If you are too close, try keeping your distance
[1:42:14] <siamzero94> Woolie; zone
[1:42:15] <ralphfromdk> Honestly straight shooting without the alt fire might be better
[1:42:28] <%Solidnick18> yeah that was a demon
[1:42:28] <%WhackyChiraqi> @WoolieVersus hold down back
[1:42:29] <Hawkbone_> Try shooting them until they die

[1:43:12] <%FuqBoiSlim> is the damage on all the weapon swings the same? like does a melee from the rocket lawn chair do more than the pistol?
[1:43:18] <+Neoepochx> Also strafing
[1:43:20] <Saltmeisterr> Anakin blanakin
[1:43:32] <SilverInferno3> This fucker will hunt you down

[1:44:38] <+TheDankDemon> boing
[1:44:41] <+Sendaar> Man this looks so much harder on console
[1:44:42] <Hawkbone_> Every death is a lesson
[1:44:43] <jorniev> MISILES BRO
[1:44:53] <SilverInferno3> Also I first thought the Invis Pinkies was a bug when I first saw them lol
[1:44:54] <+paladinstarbuster> Think like a sniper
[1:44:56] <+kaiju7544> Change vertical levels
[1:45:01] <xxterminatorviixx> Oh wow that’s a spoiler from the game
[1:45:11] <+SirGO0SE> nice jukes woolie
[1:45:13] <+kaiju7544> Never stop moving, always change levels after 1-2 kills
[1:45:13] <+paladinstarbuster> THE NOOCH
[1:45:18] <peachy996> @SilverInferno3 I legit forgot they were in here
[1:45:24] <%WhackyChiraqi> Doom looks fun as hell. Will I understand the game if I've never seen the movie?
[1:45:32] <%Solidnick18> your dead
[1:45:43] <SilverInferno3> @peachy996 Very annoying in arcade mode
[1:45:43] <peachy996> @WhackyChiraqi Yes
[1:45:45] <ThousandDogs> nah dude you gotta know what The Rock said
[1:45:46] <@Solidus_113> You gotta balance between using the remote and not
[1:45:50] <+Neoepochx> This is one of the more difficult challenges.
[1:45:53] <@Solidus_113> pick and choose on the spot
[1:45:54] <+Neoepochx> to be fair
[1:45:55] <+captain_elsewhere> this isnt a squaresoft game WhackyChiraqi why are youasking that question elaC /
[1:45:57] <+captain_elsewhere> ?
[1:45:57] <+SirGO0SE> @WhackyChiraqi LUL
[1:45:59] <+kaiju7544> Don’t focus on one enemy, shoot and keep moving to any enemy in the area
[1:46:00] <%jepupu> You should be able to hear the Quakeman jump while hopping in this map
[1:46:06] <Hawkbone_> Unfortunately, no. You need to see the movie to understand the game, The Rock shows up later and it doesn't make any sense unless you saw the movie
[1:46:09] <mr_miyagichu> @whackychiraqi yes the movie was based on the old games
[1:46:13] <%jepupu> Jumping for rockets definitely would help
[1:46:14] <peachy996> In fact not watching the movie is recommended
[1:46:16] <+Javaa01> @WhackyChiraqi You don't need to watch the movie, but the Novelizations are required reading Kappa
[1:46:24] <ThousandDogs> spoilers: Samuel Hayden was The Rock the whole time
[1:46:24] <SilverInferno3> A direct hit does more damage than just a detonation yeah?
[1:46:30] <%WhackyChiraqi> what about the japanese stage play?
[1:46:38] <Blackjackal95> Don't forget the comic
[1:46:40] <ThousandDogs> the musical or the non-musical
[1:46:44] <peachy996> Poor Rock, I remember he was so excited to talk about the BFG with Jon Stewart
[1:46:45] <ThousandDogs> important distinction
[1:46:45] <+SirGO0SE> read the manga imo
[1:46:49] <@Solidus_113> NICE

[1:47:02] <%Solidnick18> Ayeee
[1:47:06] <%cherrypiestealer> Yeee
[1:47:12] <%DensityD> DICKULOUS.
[1:47:13] <+Javaa01> Except your armor max right now is 75
[1:47:14] <SilverInferno3> Just keep that training with you
[1:47:14] <+captain_elsewhere> need to upgrade your armour to maximise
[1:47:15] <whazat> you only need... 100 armor
[1:47:15] <%cherrypiestealer> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[1:47:15] <%DensityD> oops wait
[1:47:16] <dekkitout> Wrrry-diculous
[1:47:16] <%Haarute> you gotta upgrade armor though
[1:47:17] <RyanTheRecluse> Nice
[1:47:17] <BlackermanZX> Upgraded is even better
[1:47:19] <gunsrlove> He doesn't have 100 armour tho
[1:47:20] <+Javaa01> So no infinite armor right now
[1:47:25] <StarlitStunner> doodBait
[1:47:26] <+Mtome> doodLewd
[1:47:28] <%DensityD> don't. get. touched.
[1:47:28] <%WhackyChiraqi> infinite pistol ammo
[1:47:29] <+paladinstarbuster> its cuz your a scrub
[1:47:29] <+OmegaWeltall> Das a good rune
[1:47:30] <@Solidus_113> but the other armour runes help
[1:47:31] <ghostspartan80> get armor upgrades
[1:47:35] <%DensityD> pistol-chan
[1:47:37] <%GeneralSCPatton> @whackychiraqi BOTH MOVIES ARE NEGA-CANON
[1:47:38] <+SirGO0SE> upgrade armor to upgrade ammo
[1:47:38] <%DensityD> <3
[1:47:42] <Hawkbone_> If he upgrades the rune it lowers to 75
[1:47:49] <leonheartgriever> he may not like saving throw rune trial
[1:47:53] <SilverInferno3> I mean it's the same radius as on impact
[1:47:55] <RyanTheRecluse> Self detonation allows for better strafing around pillars
[1:48:00] <+DesertPenguin> Yea, then use the armor rune and never run out ever
[1:48:03] <ThousandDogs> @GeneralSCPatton don't actually give a real answer, this is Twitch chat
[1:48:13] <%DensityD> what emblem is on woolie's hoodie?
[1:48:20] <jorniev> woolie keeps using those close quarter long range missiles
[1:48:26] <+DesertPenguin> Rich Get Richer, Armored, and the one that gives more ammo for glory kills, so if you don't have infinite you get ammo back
[1:48:27] <%WhackyChiraqi> @DensityD Reboot
[1:48:35] <unit24> woolie no
[1:48:38] <siamzero94> Combined with armored offensive it's ludicrous
[1:48:38] <SilverInferno3> @DesertPenguin EVO, or Evolution Fighting Game Tournament
[1:48:41] <unit24> why equip the rune you can't even use
[1:48:42] <%croxeye> no, it's EVO
[1:48:45] <+Javaa01> You don't have 100 Armor Cap tho
[1:48:47] <@Solidus_113> you can cheese this out by slightly damaging yourself and picking up the extra armour on the floor
[1:48:47] <%BusterRepukken> you cant even use that rune
[1:48:48] <+DesertPenguin> What about Evo?
[1:48:51] <%BusterRepukken> you dont have 100 armor
[1:48:52] <+Javaa01> So it's practically worthless right now
[1:48:52] <whazat> combined with the Equipment Rune and Siphon Grenade, it's insane
[1:49:00] <mr_miyagichu> I sat in a chat where someone unitonically asked if sfv was realistic and based on the sf movie with van damme
[1:49:02] <+TheDankDemon> 100 woolz
[1:49:09] <SilverInferno3> @DesertPenguin Whoops my bad, meant to tag someone else lol
[1:49:10] <%BusterRepukken> woolie you cant even use it
[1:49:12] <unit24> woolie just depowered himself
[1:49:13] <%GeneralSCPatton> He can work towards the upgrade and make it work without 100 cap
[1:49:16] <BlackermanZX> too bad you cant go over 75 right now
[1:49:16] <BallerSwagBro9k> Oh yeah u only have 75
[1:49:17] <jorniev> ARMOR AT 100
[1:49:18] <Lightraven_> Lmao
[1:49:20] <+Neoepochx> He needs another argent core
[1:49:21] <mr_miyagichu> I make no presumptions after that experience
[1:49:24] <siamzero94> next upgrade should be after next fight
[1:49:26] <@Solidus_113> argent cell
[1:49:29] <Hawkbone_> Damage yourself and pick up that armor
[1:49:33] <jorniev> YOU ONLY HAVE 75 CAPSTONE
[1:49:34] <+Javaa01> Then equip it once you get one
[1:49:34] <+Neoepochx> cell*

[1:54:17] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus you can damage yourself with the shotgun explosive shot and get the extra armour to fill the armour
[1:54:18] <%WhackyChiraqi> I had a dream last night that all the people I knew from high school basically sat around me at a table and took turns telling me that they wanted me to leave

[1:54:38] <%DensityD> :( you don't need to leave, bro
[1:54:38] <+Neoepochx> Another argent cell will push you to 100 armor too
[1:54:51] <+Wildorox> just got here.... how far in the game are they?
[1:54:51] <%GeneralSCPatton> Grind that shit with self-damage
[1:54:53] <%WhackyChiraqi> at least it wasn't as bad as QA
[1:55:01] <+Javaa01> Even if you lose 5 armor and fill it, it counts as progress, so if you find a lot of armor you can't use, you could just slightly damage yourself with the splash of a regular nade and farm it like that as well
[1:55:03] <+JD0394> Forgot each shard gives 5 armor on this difficulty
[1:55:19] <SilverInferno3> There's a big of an armor pile after this figh ttoo
[1:55:20] <+JD0394> Always thought they only gave 1
[1:55:28] <%boxofhooligans> DON'T drop the glory kills Woolie
[1:55:49] <jeffthesequel> I love this, but it has a few glitchs which sucks.

[2:25:36] <+DesertPenguin> If you use the Siphon Grenade with the upgraded Equipment Power Rune it will give you armor as well as health. This quickly gets you back to infinite ammo when you need it.

[2:29:35] <siamzero94> look at walls
[2:29:38] <+wardenofwinter> Nope, if the doom slayer kills a demon he absorbs the hell energy making it impossible for them to come back. That’s why they fear him he is the permanent death
[2:29:40] <ArkSeaside> you gotta sneak in

[2:30:25] <%Solidnick18> last rune
[2:30:26] <@Solidus_113> last trial
[2:30:26] <Saltmeisterr> sword logic?
[2:30:38] <%WhackyChiraqi> Doomguy even follows the same 'guardian throne world' threat as Destiny. He can't die unless we, the player, die
[2:30:38] <ThousandDogs> Doomguy is a silent protagonist.
[2:30:38] <siamzero94> 1 health
[2:30:45] <+JeluxDaCasual> THE SWORD LOGIC!!
[2:30:50] <+Javaa01> Extra life basically
[2:30:53] <dekkitout> It's a Destiny thing, look it up
[2:30:54] <+DesertPenguin> Never used this
[2:30:58] <KnightAsteran> @saltmeisterr the strength of whatever you kill is added to yours
[2:31:07] <Saltmeisterr> neat
[2:31:08] <+DesertPenguin> I never used this because I never beat the trial. It's a hard one
[2:31:11] <random_moo> I used this on Boss’s
[2:31:13] <joniroquai> Good luck
[2:31:15] <+TheBigTaco> wrong
[2:31:25] <%KeslGames> KeslGames subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:31:26] <siamzero94> no no but siege mode gets you killed here
[2:31:33] <+linSP> i dont think this rune would be very useful on nightmare
[2:31:33] <resloxxx> Gracias por el LuvBlondeR, @keslgames.
[2:31:34] <%WhackyChiraqi> Sword Logic is from destiny, it's basically willpower so intense that you carve the weakness from the universe and add it's strength to yours. The sword implies that if you CAN kill it, it deserved to die. The final shape of the universe will be the strongest thing of the universe
[2:31:46] <@Solidus_113> watch your cornerds

[2:37:11] <+DiabloDeAzul> @thackattack00 they're GoW style cutscenes that make you invincible, and don't have tactical advantage like throws in a beat-em-up
[2:37:14] <masterfire23> Fragged
[2:37:18] <+thackattack00> LUL LUL LUL
[2:37:19] <+DesertPenguin> CD?
[2:37:22] <+DesertPenguin> Yea, no
[2:37:26] <georgian52> not me, us
[2:37:32] <+DesertPenguin> Again, I never used got it and beat the game
[2:37:40] <+thackattack00> Being invincible is a pretty big tactical advantage I'd say
[2:37:45] <peachy996> When you have a chance for Siege against Cacodemon or Hell Knight why not take it
[2:37:46] <+DesertPenguin> CD is super easy with holograms, Siege Mode, and Turret Mode
[2:37:47] <+thackattack00> Plus they heal you
[2:37:47] <random_moo> It helps just to keep the flow
[2:37:48] <spooksy> you can do it!
[2:37:49] <Hawkbone_> Glory kills are actually a genius way to encourage aggressiveness in this gam'e
[2:37:50] <+DiabloDeAzul> They literally waste your time and bruttal doom allowed you to turn them off, that's how pointless it was
[2:37:50] <+Javaa01> If you're playing on a high difficulty, you don't need Saving Throw
[2:37:52] <BlackermanZX> imagine not loving the glory kills
[2:37:55] <ThousandDogs> there's no tactical advantage to forcing enemies to spawn health
[2:37:55] <%FuqBoiSlim> dang...
[2:37:57] <BlackermanZX> just imagine
[2:37:59] <ThousandDogs> hold the L you chud
[2:38:00] <siamzero94> Siege caco immediately
[2:38:04] <+theuselessace> they are also a heal unlik gow
[2:38:06] <1matheuw> the caco hit you
[2:38:20] <random_moo> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[2:38:24] <rsg220> It's not about the RUNE. IT"S ABOUT THE RIDE
[2:38:25] <joniroquai> There's no healing from glory kills in this challenge
[2:38:26] <ArkSeaside> good good
[2:38:28] <spooksy> hold the L not hold L
[2:38:30] <ArkSeaside> do that start
[2:38:36] <Ashenik1> "After you deal with the Caco the pinky shall come in" Kappa
[2:38:37] <peachy996> I like that you can turn the blue/orange glow off
[2:38:46] <+BurkeBigsby> Does this Doom have a dash?
[2:38:48] <+kaiju7544> You missed super hard
[2:38:53] <Charronia> Instant whiff punish
[2:38:54] <RyanTheRecluse> Getting through this trial is an indicator you can get through nightmare
[2:39:04] <Count_Long> Have you tried SHOOTING the enemies?
[2:39:14] <Brodius> Use the right stick more. You're aiming with your legs more than your arms.
[2:39:20] <+thesyndrome> so close
[2:39:22] <+aceleapc> "mechanic the game is based around is pointless" lmfao LUL
[2:39:28] <giga_bit> Woolie struggling so hard with the strafe shots
[2:39:28] <+DiabloDeAzul> @Hawkbone_ a better solution to fix campers would be to make the MONSTERS more aggressive and work together in groups to get rid of circle strafing
[2:39:29] <resloxxx> Clear the adds and then you can use siege mode
[2:39:30] <+tearknack> yeah, what brodius said
[2:39:32] <Charronia> Demon coming in with the srk
[2:39:33] <+paladinstarbuster> stuffed'
[2:39:42] <333agus333> Pro tip: just shoot them lmao
[2:39:42] <Count_Long> Well, he jumped
[2:39:49] <SilverInferno3> Chat settle something for me: Soba or Udon
[2:39:50] <Hawkbone_> @DiabloDeAzul The monsters are already incredibly aggressive.
[2:39:52] <Count_Long> he Shoryuuppa'd you

[2:40:45] <SilverInferno3> Udon it is! Thanks peeps
[2:40:53] <ArkSeaside> pinpointing the caco's eye helps a lot, and that's easier with a mouse
[2:40:54] <Count_Long> udon is eh
[2:40:57] <Count_Long> but hey
[2:40:58] <masterfire23> just shoot them 4Head
[2:41:00] <Count_Long> soup is always a win
[2:41:04] <Hawkbone_> "Glory kills are pointless" is quite possibly the worst take I've seen regarding this game
[2:41:04] <Brodius> Nice
[2:41:15] <%SilvaChariot0133> lytLEERY
[2:41:17] <peachy996> gettin awfully close to that cacodemon
[2:41:25] <+BurkeBigsby> Damn, I feel like most of the trouble is controller related.
[2:41:30] <+DiabloDeAzul> @Hawkbone_ I still say Brutal doom already solved this problem, and in OG doom camping wasn't even a problem
[2:41:31] <+TheBigTaco> yeah its a pretty awful take

[2:44:48] <Brodius> Saving Throw isn't that important anyway
[2:44:49] <Count_Long> reeeee
[2:44:51] <%Lion_kun> This rune is worth it though.
[2:44:52] <Cykron> Do it off camera
[2:44:52] <+Neoepochx> Got to 3 left
[2:44:53] <+tearknack> @xx123manxx no we don't
[2:44:59] <+aceleapc> @WoolieVersus You have to shoot the pinkies and spectres from the back
[2:45:02] <%KeslGames> LET'S GO
[2:45:05] <+xx123manxx> lmao u rite
[2:45:05] <sunsetserenity1> Honestly this time isn't worth it on normal difficulty, you can just skip it
[2:45:07] <Vyneci> He'll keep doing it chat, he just stopped the recording
[2:45:11] <+Neoepochx> there are usually an imp and zombie and 1 bigger dude
[2:45:14] <sunsetserenity1> *rune
[2:45:14] <+DiabloDeAzul> @TheBigTaco I'm saying that it's a feature many players overlook because (like woolie, for example) because it's a speedbump that has to be abused for i-frames, because if they took out the i-frames, nobody would do it because not getting hit is a better option despite the ammo loss not doing the glory kill
[2:45:17] <Brodius> @Lion_kun Only on the higher difficulties though
[2:45:18] <Jolly_Adventurer> Would cutting this part in the video be King Crimson or The Hand?
[2:45:23] <+linSP> psaDab first try coming up
[2:45:26] <+Neoepochx> for 3 sets
[2:45:35] <siamzero94> you totally can
[2:45:47] <Brodius> Use Siege mode Woolie
[2:45:47] <+DiabloDeAzul> They had to get rid of TWO weapons to get the glory kill to work
[2:45:49] <1matheuw> shoot him in the ass woolie
[2:45:59] <ArkSeaside> try hitting the Caco in the upper portion instead
[2:46:01] <Hawkbone_> ???
[2:46:02] <mrsnugglewoods> fuck the coco demon
[2:46:04] <%Lion_kun> Saved my ass a few times against bosses
[2:46:04] <ArkSeaside> pick out his eye

[2:46:06] <@Commando_Joe> must kill fast and GUN TOO SLOW stripGun
[2:46:09] <Count_Long> i love how you blow its arms off

[2:47:05] <+DiabloDeAzul> @theuselessace chat asked me why I thought glory kills were pointless, so I answered
[2:47:06] <peachy996> Imp'd
[2:47:09] <+xx123manxx> i can feel the soul being torn out of his body
[2:47:11] <+MrRabbles> that Imp was a savior to his people
[2:47:12] <%Solidnick18> shhh
[2:47:16] <BlackermanZX> That was THE run
[2:47:26] <+TheBigTaco> @DiabloDeAzul okay, but the scenarios in which you are low health and scramble to find a goon to glory kill allows for tense momnents in the gameplay that keep it interesting. plus it uh... looks cool man
[2:47:29] <+kaiju7544> Somebody’s get fuuuuuuuuuuucked LUL LUL LUL LUL
[2:47:34] <%Solidnick18> it was all reggies fault Kappa

[2:48:03] <Brodius> Siege the Coco
[2:48:05] <Hawkbone_> Glory kills are so obviously not pointless, its a major mechanic that plays a big role in combat, but not big enough that if you want to ignore it, you can.
[2:48:07] <%KeslGames> Woolie is just showcasing all the unique death animations! Yeah!
[2:48:13] <ghostspartan80> siege the cac asap

[2:48:37] <Count_Long> That imp is a badass
[2:48:39] <spooksy> almost got it
[2:48:39] <+DiabloDeAzul> @TheBigTaco Not so satisfying when you do them the thousandth time, they have a powerup where you cut the animation by half because they can't have enough animations to justify it
[2:48:39] <%Solidnick18> forget*
[2:48:40] <BlackermanZX> The Imp god

[2:50:03] <burgerbro34> Holy Woolie used mitosis and made a smaller, better dressed Woolie!
[2:50:08] <@Solidus_113> that's the last
[2:50:08] <mjolnrvii> The imp was even charging the fast projectile lol.

[2:50:30] <Brodius> Saving throw is the last
[2:50:40] <Hawkbone_> @DiabloDeAzul So just don't do them if you have such a huge problem with it. They literally have an option to turn off the blue/orange glow.
[2:50:40] <%cherrypiestealer> !MOTIVATED
[2:50:40] <@Moobot> 644 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[2:50:41] <RyanTheRecluse> Nice, though the rune is kinda useless on your current difficulty.
[2:50:44] <ghostspartan80> saving throw gonna come handy soon
[2:50:46] <+thesyndrome> !uptime
[2:50:46] <%Solidnick18> lol
[2:50:46] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 50 minutes
[2:50:49] <vincerocmm> here i come ruffer then rthe rest ofthem
[2:50:57] <spooksy> whatever makes you feel better scrub <3
[2:50:58] <+Balkespower> Now I am motivated!
[2:50:59] <+Giggalith> !MOTIVATED
[2:51:02] <+TheBigTaco> theres always room for scrubbiness
[2:51:06] <%Solidnick18> you know your limits
[2:51:07] <SilverInferno3> Can you tell my parents that
[2:51:08] <%BusterRepukken> that rune is for higher difficulties
[2:51:09] <+theuselessace> @diablodeazul but guns get just as unsatisfying after repeated use. the point of glory kills are variety and a way to heal
[2:51:09] <RyanTheRecluse> You’re now ready for Nightmare
[2:51:25] <ArkSeaside> when you die it goes into a slow motion mode for a bit
[2:51:27] <Djinnazz> Unless your #1
[2:51:27] <+Javaa01> The game goes into slowmo when you die with Saving Throw, you'll know when it's active
[2:51:30] <Brodius> Did Woolie ever get the upgrade module from the Argent Facility?
[2:51:34] <ghostspartan80> Nightmare is basically that challenge as a playthough
[2:51:34] <+Balkespower> You mean Ultra-Nightmare Kappa
[2:51:46] <@Solidus_113> that works
[2:51:47] <ArkSeaside> next time that happens just whip out the BFG
[2:51:48] <%Haarute> yeyeye
[2:51:53] <Hawkbone_> Its not off
[2:51:55] <+thackattack00> it isnt off just reduced
[2:51:55] <+Javaa01> Self damage is REDUCED
[2:51:56] <+xx123manxx> reduced
[2:51:56] <ArkSeaside> no its just reduced
[2:51:57] <%GeneralSCPatton> SELF DAMAGE IS REDUCED
[2:52:07] <ghostspartan80> REDACTED
[2:52:10] <RyanTheRecluse> Reduced
[2:52:16] <+DiabloDeAzul> @Hawkbone_ did you forget the demons get back up if you don't do a glory kill? You can't ignore the mechanic because not only that, but some runes NEED it, turning off color flashes doesn't help
[2:52:17] <1matheuw> cluster bomb is cool
[2:52:30] <samuelfisk> Woolie is Mr Burns “Indestructible”
[2:52:31] <Hawkbone_> @DiabloDeAzul Shoot them, dummy.
[2:52:33] <+Javaa01> You don't need to max out Dexterity, it's just for Mod swapping
[2:52:43] <Hawkbone_> You have a gun
[2:52:48] <Brodius> It's a shame that you already have the Super Shotgun by the time you can max out the Combat Shotgun
[2:52:54] <%HollowedIdjit> IT'S TIME. FOR YA BOI

[2:54:14] <%Solidnick18> SourPls
[2:54:18] <Hawkbone_> @DiabloDeAzul Yes, the demons don't get more health, they just do more damage and have more complex patterns.
[2:54:23] <Brodius> Quad shot is so strong
[2:54:24] <Saltmeisterr> SourPls
[2:54:30] <ralphfromdk> This room is one of the best in the game, it's just pure arena with so many levels.

[2:55:08] <+thesyndrome> LUL
[2:55:10] <ralphfromdk> That's one big ass needle

[2:55:37] <ArkSeaside> you want th eBFG projectile to travel as far as possible
[2:55:41] <+xx123manxx> doomslayer put on the heelies
[2:55:59] <+linSP> tell woolie to use the fast glory kills and teleporting glory kills runes for the next berserk powerup
[2:55:59] <+Javaa01> The portals are there because this is a vidya, and it really doesn't matter why they're there
[2:56:00] <BallerSwagBro9k> SourPls
[2:56:21] <+DiabloDeAzul> @theuselessace I liked the chainsaw better when it was an actual weapon than a 1-use bat for a blood pinata
[2:56:32] <Brodius> Woolie is having so much fun switching guns.
[2:56:43] <Hawkbone_> The chainsaw was completely useless in OG Doom and serves to kill you more often than it'd help.
[2:56:50] <%Aeoneth> It's basically FPS Style switching
[2:57:01] <Brodius> lul
[2:57:04] <ArkSeaside> BFG

[3:09:50] <SilverInferno3> He made it SO FAR
[3:09:51] <dukenux> It wasnt even about proper Black/Death Metal bands, iirc Def Leppard felt under Satanic Panic
[3:09:58] <+thackattack00> Reggie with the TPAB reference? Goated
[3:10:03] <%DensityD> LUL
[3:10:09] <+paladinstarbuster> That guy was a badass

[3:10:24] <%DensityD> LARGE HEART
[3:10:24] <Spirit_NB> Ah, the classic
[3:10:29] <%Aeoneth> Or something
[3:10:29] <DeathByPoke7> Happy Valentines day
[3:10:31] <Tersalus> MAWNCH IT
[3:10:31] <$TIME_PUNCHER> It's yours :O
[3:10:33] <ihaveahugepersonality> Is a chainsaw an instrument?
[3:10:33] <+chase959> shoot it
[3:10:35] <+Balkespower> Large Heart fit for heavy
[3:10:35] <BallerSwagBro9k> Thats kinda big to be a heart
[3:10:35] <%DensityD> that was larger than a cow heart
[3:10:36] <+thesyndrome> @WoolieVersus that heart on a pedastal is a reference to the OG doom
[3:10:38] <Hawkbone_> Well, thats one way to do ut
[3:10:40] <SilverInferno3> Lol that's the worst way to do it but it works
[3:10:41] <rcand9> goof work
[3:10:43] <@Squdnate> @Ipsenscastle It's a subgenre of progressive death metal, where instead of melodic guitar strings, it's rythm.
[3:10:44] <+YabbaTroll> whatever works
[3:11:01] <SilverInferno3> One day Woolie will learn how Pinkies work, but not today
[3:11:11] <Brodius> That Imp got a few good hits in
[3:11:30] <BallerSwagBro9k> Doom Eternal is still 1 month away FeelsBadMan
[3:11:33] <Tersalus> bonk'd
[3:11:35] <+thesyndrome> that greande was accidentally sick
[3:11:41] <+Balkespower> but it is coming closer

[3:12:15] <+thesyndrome> I love how woolie is coming to realize that Doom is basically the Devil May Cry of FPS games
[3:12:16] <+VanaSkiller> jdotkdLUL
[3:12:17] <@Squdnate> @DiabloDeAzul Be nice
[3:12:19] <BlackermanZX> Aaaand gone
[3:12:23] <graemecrackers1> good point @DiabloDeAzul
[3:12:24] <+xx123manxx> he got snapped
[3:12:25] <+theuselessace> LOL
[3:12:30] <Brodius> @DiabloDeAzul Why are you even here?
[3:12:32] <Malucoblz02> @BallerSwagBro9k we getting Bayonetta and vanqish next week, and in 2, Megaman Zero collection, did that brought a smile on?
[3:12:33] <+Muzzle131> what was that comment
[3:12:36] <+TheBigTaco> well what woolie just did was a pretty good argument for glory kills lol
[3:12:40] <+Balkespower> the Charging pinkies take more damage when you hit their back.
[3:12:47] <+DiabloDeAzul> @Squdnate I apologize for the ad hominem.
[3:12:51] <+Javaa01> Nah, just environmental detail
[3:12:53] <joniroquai> Syndrome wouldn't Bullsetstorm count too?
[3:12:54] <+xx123manxx> wish reggie would give me a 30 second timeout
[3:12:54] <peachy996> Fight about it elsewhere
[3:12:59] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @ZComiX
[3:13:00] <BallerSwagBro9k> @Malucoblz02 it helps FeelsAmazingMan
[3:13:00] <peachy996> Use whispers
[3:13:06] <Brodius> Burst
[3:13:07] <%Aeoneth> Charge burst is good
[3:13:07] <+Javaa01> Both kinda suck
[3:13:08] <SilverInferno3> For real guys I have no stake in this argument but I hate seeing all of it, let's just have a good time ripping and tearing, bullets or fists
[3:13:10] <Hawkbone_> Boomers out here searching desperately for things to hate about NuDOOM
[3:13:13] <+DiabloDeAzul> @Brodius Pissing in the wind because I'm bored, I mean why are you here?
[3:13:22] <+xx123manxx> COD of Duty
[3:13:22] <dukenux> scopes in doom Kappa
[3:13:23] <awalr> cod mod
[3:13:23] <+YabbaTroll> my sweet baby charged burst being picked last :(
[3:13:33] <rcand9> why you have to be mad is only a game
[3:13:38] <Brodius> @DiabloDeAzul Watching the stream instead of arguing with chat
[3:13:42] <Hawkbone_> @DiabloDeAzul If you hate this game so much then why are you watching a stream of people who love it so much?
[3:13:42] <dukenux> this does feel like a bone for tacticool shooter crowd
[3:13:43] <+firmlygraspi1> the scope is excellent
[3:13:48] <psychoteletubby7> scope was good for early game. fell off later
[3:13:53] <Charronia> Chainsaw only run
[3:13:58] <SilverInferno3> Scope ain't bad, not as destructive but can be fun
[3:14:15] <+linSP> burst is great dps but only up close
[3:14:19] <Brodius> Scope is good for headshots in earlier stages
[3:14:20] <+firmlygraspi1> its kills
[3:14:21] <%BusterRepukken> scope is gonna be way better in Eternal
[3:14:24] <+DesertPenguin> Scope has it's place if you wanna thin the crowd before going all in
[3:14:26] <Spirit_NB> Scope was surprisingly useful in nightmare. ammo efficient
[3:14:30] <+JD0394> Fully upgraded scope one shots human sized enemies on a headshot. Great weapon on m+kb
[3:14:31] <+DesertPenguin> Exactly
[3:14:31] <+DiabloDeAzul> @Hawkbone_ I like woolie, and nothing else was on. It was only one piss take, I was just defending my opinion
[3:14:32] <valentinevergil> 50 hedgeogs
[3:14:33] <BaslerJones> has woolie ever beaten the original doom ?
[3:14:34] <+DesertPenguin> Ammo efficient
[3:14:41] <@Squdnate> @ZComiX Try and post the clip again
[3:14:49] <SonofMelonHead> Scope really chews up imps.
[3:14:50] <peachy996> Scope is good for the early platforming section where the Imps annoy you
[3:14:53] <Saltmeisterr> full auto is a way better mod that burst
[3:14:56] <+YabbaTroll> @BaslerJones this is probablt the <10th fps he's played
[3:14:57] <graemecrackers1> for whom the bell tolls!
[3:14:57] <SilverInferno3> @JD0394 Don't most weapons do that tho
[3:14:59] <BallerSwagBro9k> THE VOCALS Kreygasm
[3:15:09] <Hawkbone_> @DiabloDeAzul I like Woolie too, but if he's playing a game I hate, I don't go into his Twitch chat and start arguments with people with my bad takes.
[3:15:12] <BaslerJones> @YabbaTroll then we most
[3:15:22] <BaslerJones> must get him to play*
[3:15:25] <graemecrackers1> The Metal will never die
[3:15:28] <Brodius> That poor skeleot
[3:15:38] <Blackjackal95> Eternal looks insanely smooth/refined, it's crazy
[3:15:39] <Brodius> He finally learned how to kill a Pinkie
[3:15:40] <+xx123manxx> EZ Clap
[3:15:43] <Camopredator26> That mastery challenge is way easier on older levels @woolieversus
[3:15:44] <SilverInferno3> Holy shit Woolie learned how to fight Pinkies
[3:15:50] <%jepupu> Headshots are good on weaklings.
[3:15:50] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:15:53] <SilverInferno3> Praise Satan
[3:15:55] <ohnoitspooba> Olé
[3:15:59] <Brodius> Thank you Satan
[3:16:02] <presque> He's in the zone
[3:16:04] <dukenux> TOASTY!
[3:16:08] <graemecrackers1> Bless us Satan
[3:16:09] <SilverInferno3> We'll kill you last ol' Red
[3:16:10] <+thesyndrome> Doom is teaching Woolie some great FPS skills
[3:16:12] <Rojahh> hit em with the masvidal
[3:16:12] <+DiabloDeAzul> @Hawkbone_ You've probably never been bored before.
[3:16:12] <Hawkbone_> Eternal is really shaping up to be one of the best FPS of all time. I mean, this game is already pretty high up there, so if Eternal is even better, woof.
[3:16:13] <@Solidus_113> fuel behind you
[3:16:17] <Lavrohas> what runes is he running rn
[3:16:24] <+xx123manxx> 100%
[3:16:27] <%jepupu> You missed a perfectly good headshot
[3:16:28] <SilverInferno3> Real talk Doomguy for MK11
[3:16:30] <%GeneralSCPatton> I want him to use Heat Blast. The auto-charge is great.
[3:16:31] <BallerSwagBro9k> UH HO
[3:16:36] <resloxxx> uhh
[3:16:38] <DaBigVitus> is this endgame?
[3:16:38] <BallerSwagBro9k> Audio broken
[3:16:39] <neutral_guy> No game audio?
[3:16:42] <%Haarute> sound broke
[3:16:43] <Hawkbone_> @DiabloDeAzul Why don't you do watch an older LP if you have nothing else to do, instead of spewing salt and bad takes for no reason in Twitch chat.
[3:16:46] <+Estuko> I was gonna say, the dungeon gave me an Oblivion kinda feel
[3:16:46] <@Solidus_113> haste broke the audio for a second
[3:16:50] <BallerSwagBro9k> Audio partially broken
[3:16:51] <Brodius> Auto Charge is sick
[3:16:51] <dukenux> no sound guys
[3:16:52] <@Solidus_113> it's good
[3:17:00] <SilverInferno3> Still a Bethesda game guys
[3:17:01] <SonofMelonHead> Doomguy's footsteps are just really quiet.
[3:17:02] <dukenux> ohhh, im stupid
[3:17:11] <%Haarute> doom guy stealth mode
[3:17:18] <SonofMelonHead> Seriously, it sounds like he's wearing socks.
[3:17:24] <@Solidus_113> continue to rip
[3:17:28] <@Solidus_113> and tear
[3:17:35] <awalr> @Lavrohas rich get richer, saving throw and i forget the last
[3:17:37] <ghostspartan80> Doomguy is very light on his feet

[3:18:09] <Brodius> HEAVYARMS CUSTOM
[3:18:24] <dukenux> Why would they leave him those powerups
[3:18:28] <niddron> yamero Woolie have pity
[3:18:28] <%gatorafan> Are they even TRYING to stop you?
[3:18:28] <+Nobrev> They're giving Woolie too much power
[3:18:30] <Charronia> Blowing a straight path to Satan
[3:18:34] <+DiabloDeAzul> @Hawkbone_ Look, if you wanted me to go away, all you had to do was ignore my piss take for what it was. And now I'm stuck replying why I felt D44M was underwhelming despite paying for it.
[3:18:35] <%gatorafan> It's like they are rolling the carpet
[3:18:36] <graemecrackers1> yes heavy arms!
[3:18:44] <Blackjackal95> @dukenux Because video game

[3:19:03] <+Estuko> that feel when you're trying the new human nuggets from your local Mcdonalds in hell and you hear shotgun sounds and heavy metal
[3:19:05] <@Squdnate> I wanna see if I made Moobot less of a beech

[3:19:27] <Hawkbone_> @DiabloDeAzul You know you could just...leave...right? You aren't forced to stay here, especially since you "defending" your shit take isn't gonna change anyones mind. Everyone is still gonna say its a shit take.
[3:19:30] <SilverInferno3> Good job Squd

[3:21:09] <resloxxx> NO
[3:21:09] <%Aeoneth> You need a platform woolie. Double jump is too low
[3:21:11] <+thesyndrome> it didnt
[3:21:11] <Tucker0603> no
[3:21:11] <rcand9> it didnt
[3:21:11] <+xx123manxx> get him below the ledge there
[3:21:12] <CoffeeSlice> it didn't
[3:21:12] <sunsetserenity1> Can you guys stop arguing, you're not going to change each other's minds. If you think his opinion is stupid just ignore it.
[3:21:13] <+Balkespower> No it not
[3:21:13] <BlackermanZX> it didnt
[3:21:14] <Vyneci> It didn't
[3:21:15] <rcand9> nope
[3:21:15] <Brodius> Too low
[3:21:17] <%Solidnick18> NO
[3:21:18] <%Haarute> DIDN't
[3:21:19] <@Solidus_113> you have to be looking down
[3:21:20] <+Balkespower> you need to be higher
[3:21:26] <CoffeeSlice> sad!
[3:21:27] <%Aeoneth> You need a platform
[3:21:29] <@Solidus_113> it's camera perspective, not character height
[3:21:29] <siamzero94> Look also down
[3:21:33] <%Haarute> you need to look down
[3:21:34] <%Aeoneth> Barons are too big
[3:21:34] <%Solidnick18> wait
[3:21:35] <+Neoepochx> The other demons were shorter
[3:21:35] <+thackattack00> They're too tall to just jump above
[3:21:35] <awalr> double jump and look down
[3:21:37] <peachy996> They're too big for the double jump trick
[3:21:38] <+bubbli97> they big boys
[3:21:39] <+thesyndrome> he's too tall for you to jump above
[3:21:42] <+AJ_Cherenkov> They're too tall for just double
[3:21:43] <BlackermanZX> look down too
[3:21:43] <artoflec> yeah barons are yuge
[3:21:48] <Brodius> Good try
[3:21:56] <rcand9> you need to be literally on top of the boy
[3:21:56] <+kraajkase> They're too tall for double jump
[3:22:02] <+Neoepochx> There are a few more barons here iirc
[3:22:08] <@Solidus_113> Automap is later, despite being this room
[3:22:11] <+thesyndrome> look around, a secret opened up when you finished the fight
[3:22:22] <Brodius> Demon to tall to Double Jump
[3:22:24] <peachy996> This is very similar to the MKX Krypt
[3:22:26] <+gryffon95> its the otherside i think
[3:22:27] <siamzero94> You're in hell, you'll have plenty of oppurtinity
[3:22:36] <Brodius> Is Shang Tsung here?

[3:24:34] <dekkitout> Doomguy with The Power Cosmic would be unfathomable
[3:24:44] <ghostspartan80> I wonder how Reggie finds Spiders that could be Masterminds
[3:24:52] <resloxxx> NotLikeThis

[3:34:38] <This_is_Marco> mancubus is a big fleshy hitbox
[3:34:40] <peachy996> I remember someone calling Mancubus a lobster
[3:34:44] <Count_Long> Mancubus, modeled entirely on Boogie, and Cyber Mancubus is Boogie after he has fused to his gaming chair
[3:34:57] <Hawkbone_> Mancubus got a VR headset so he can always be looking at big anime titties
[3:34:58] <BlackermanZX> inb4 woolie gets crushed

[3:37:02] <Hawkbone_> God, Doomguy is so fucking cool, dude
[3:37:03] <+Muzzle131> best way to handle a doom guy invasion is to wait it out he'll get bore eventually

[3:37:31] <%FuqBoiSlim> @iwashi94 theres a rune that gives you infinite ammo if you have over 100 armor
[3:37:31] <+StooEsq> Do not taunt Doomguy.
[3:37:33] <peachy996> I'm surprised Doom Guy has only 1 demonic fanboy and not his own cult
[3:37:36] <+xx123manxx> rich get richer

[3:38:18] <+TheDankDemon> on the floor

[3:38:29] <+Neoepochx> He stabs the horn into the brain this time!
[3:38:35] <awalr> similar but yeah it doesn't look like a from above

[3:38:42] <+kelanth462> lever back in the puncer room
[3:38:46] <Hawkbone_> I love that the demons call the SSG Lucifers Bane.
[3:38:48] <Count_Long> Doomguys motto for hell is "Let them hate me, so long as they fear me.".
[3:38:48] <+kelanth462> pounder
[3:38:50] <mybigmeech> As in fearing him, as apposed to workshop
[3:38:53] <SilverInferno3> @DensityD Also it had a big gun on top of it

[3:39:53] <siamzero94> Yeah we saw what happened with him
[3:40:05] <Niney_Who> 1 Very Angry Man vs a 100 Ft Tall Demon
[3:40:09] <dekkitout> Doomguy literally went Attack on Ttian
[3:40:09] <@Solidus_113> that corpse at the beginning
[3:40:16] <+Taglog7> Okay, Dr. Claw
[3:40:20] <DeathByPoke7> You did kill the big thing
[3:40:22] <rcand9> titan was a bitch
[3:40:22] <mybigmeech> Didn't doomguy beat the town BEFORE he got the suit?

[3:40:56] <peachy996> Ol' Moose Horns
[3:41:11] <+aceleapc> can't believe doom guy had a shadow of the colossus fight and we didn't get to do it
[3:41:20] <rcand9> titan was the skeleton
[3:41:33] <+Muzzle131> doom guy only lets one demon live the demon that plays the trumpet playing doot doot doot
[3:41:35] <BallerSwagBro9k> @aceleapc Welp...we will in Eternal
[3:41:36] <SilverInferno3> Or blowing its head off
[3:41:40] <ralphfromdk> mybigmeech Nah, the suit was burried in another box next to his prison, so he had it with him the first time around. Keep in mind, this hell has traces of higher tech levels from which the humans have copied stuff from (like the gauss canon tech)
[3:41:54] <SilverInferno3> SHADOW PEOPLE!?
[3:41:55] <+TheDankDemon> why tho
[3:41:57] <RyanTheRecluse> Titan was the skeleton from before, cyberdemon is just some demon noble
[3:42:07] <mybigmeech> Oh that makes sense
[3:42:10] <sleepy_pixels> they should have just put a romote off switxch on it tbh
[3:42:21] <SilverInferno3> Ultimate Battle Demon oml
[3:42:24] <+YabbaTroll> BIOWEAPONRY
[3:42:25] <+Muzzle131> im guessing the titan is the one on the box art that has lava spewing out over it
[3:42:31] <rcand9> cyber demons are so rad

[3:42:47] <peachy996> I love Noob Saibot voice
[3:42:55] <gunsrlove> This is way different
[3:42:56] <@Solidus_113> Modulation
[3:42:57] <ghostspartan80> I love the voice
[3:42:58] <mybigmeech> You mean Dr Claw voice?
[3:43:07] <This_is_Marco> the voice doesnt sound pitch shifted but does make me feel bad for the VA
[3:43:09] <peachy996> There's a bit of bass to this voice
[3:43:16] <+sherndon226> This is a demon whispering what happened so the Doomslayer doesnt hear him
[3:43:16] <dekkitout> When it sounds like a Decepticon
[3:43:17] <Charronia> Cookie monster vocals
[3:43:19] <BallerSwagBro9k> ITS SICK
[3:43:21] <SilverInferno3> Here we go
[3:43:22] <Hawkbone_> Also its a disembodied voice, thats makes it better

[3:43:28] <%Aeoneth> Dr. Claw
[3:43:31] <+MrRabbles> *rune
[3:43:38] <javis88h> Noob's voice is pretty try hard tbh
[3:43:40] <SilverInferno3> Nah he still gotta do saving throw at least
[3:43:42] <+Balkespower> KILL
[3:43:44] <+xx123manxx> not even close reggie
[3:43:44] <peachy996> It was better than his voice in MKX
[3:43:46] <%GeneralSCPatton> I tried imitating that voice. Throat hurt for the rest of the night.
[3:43:48] <+rider_megalon> not as bad as the new Sonya voice
[3:43:51] <peachy996> Reggie now you are the hater
[3:43:51] <Dapper_Cactuar> Hasn't even Noob's voice actor made fun of the Noob voice?

[3:54:19] <SilverInferno3> I'd like to see Woolie tackle Arcade, it's basically the campaign but with a style meter
[3:54:19] <resloxxx> Directions
[3:54:23] <%FuqBoiSlim> >tfw Keen died and went to mobile game hell NotLikeThis
[3:54:27] <+linSP> try out ultra nightmare after you beat the game wools
[3:54:42] <@Solidus_113> back to the start
[3:54:46] <+RealThiele> yea its a mobile game with him and FemKeen where they mine bitcoin for bethesda till they die
[3:55:02] <Kalinflip> @RealThiele atpRtsd lmaoooooooo
[3:55:03] <mybigmeech> Ironically, you can find a commander keen skeleton in this game
[3:55:08] <Ashenik1> @linSP is it the one with no saves?
[3:55:10] <BlackermanZX> what demon designed this place doodBait
[3:55:10] <gustavozxd> I thought it was supposed to be his children or something?
[3:55:12] <%averyoddjew> just heard the final thing they are adding to DMC 3 SE for switch. THE HYPE LIVES
[3:55:13] <+firmlygraspi1> remove grey
[3:55:15] <rcand9> lets go see
[3:55:16] <+xx123manxx> woolie vs directions
[3:55:18] <Kalinflip> @mybigmeech They were letting us know early on that he is dead
[3:55:26] <+linSP> @ashenik1 permadeath
[3:55:28] <+thesyndrome> I watched an interview with john Romero, where he gushed about how cool the new Doom and Wolfenstein games were, then the interviewer asked about the new Keen mobile game and he just said "yeah...." then quickly moved on
[3:55:31] <Saltmeisterr> @averyoddjew what is it?
[3:55:34] <+worthwhile_off> Don't think I didn't catch that T.I. reference
[3:55:36] <+firmlygraspi1> look how juicy and tempting that grey map is! it could be anything!
[3:55:50] <%averyoddjew> @Saltmeisterr coop bloody palace with dante and virgil
[3:55:50] <mybigmeech> He's quite literally, stick in hell
[3:55:58] <Saltmeisterr> SICK
[3:56:06] <@Solidus_113> Do it now, because you've maxed all the relics
[3:56:07] <mybigmeech> This autocorrect I swear to god
[3:56:08] <+SirGO0SE> Luigi game the system
[3:56:19] <gustavozxd> so Woolie doesn't want to use classic aim?
[3:56:20] <Saltmeisterr> now pat is going to be even more pissed
[3:56:22] <+firmlygraspi1> first you end all, then you be it
[3:56:25] <+PleasantLeech> woah co op?
[3:56:29] <ghostspartan80> lol where tf is he going
[3:56:29] <SilverInferno3> Doom Eternal on Switch should have a Luigi skin
[3:56:30] <+Nobrev> @saltmeisterr @averyoddjew it's only local coop but still hype
[3:56:37] <SheefEatsBeef> it is
[3:56:40] <awalr> more games should do the Hollow Knight thing where you can hold a button to bring up the map while walking around
[3:56:40] <%FuqBoiSlim> whole lotta red
[3:56:48] <rcand9> oooh
[3:56:53] <gustavozxd> coop in dmc3 PogChamp switch only atpRtsd
[3:56:56] <+xx123manxx> outplayed
[3:56:58] <+RealThiele> hollow knights biggest flaw to me was the compass and map system
[3:57:15] <ghostspartan80> bugged direction mechanics
[3:57:31] <vincerocmm> locddoor open
[3:57:38] <+SirGO0SE> @RealThiele imo hollow knights biggest flaw bar none is the corpse run. its a game that wants you to explore with a mechanic that stunts exploration
[3:57:39] <Saltmeisterr> i like the map system but i understand why people hate it
[3:57:39] <+xx123manxx> reeeeeeally wish dmc pc would get these features
[3:57:41] <rcand9> woolievs 3d maps
[3:57:43] <@Solidus_113> middle
[3:57:45] <Count_Long> yo whoever said he hadnt played this fuckin lied. Hes over here talking about bugs in second replays.
[3:57:49] <gustavozxd> the map system in hollow knight is the cause for one of my favorite moments I've ever experienced in videogames so eh
[3:57:56] <Kalinflip> dmc3 pc already has style switching as a mod
[3:58:05] <alrobot2014> @Count_Long he's talking about replaying levels
[3:58:08] <@Solidus_113> greeeeeeen
[3:58:08] <SilverInferno3> Woolie's invested in QA abilities, it's just a passive buff
[3:58:16] <Saltmeisterr> at least the got rid of the corpse run it silksong
[3:58:18] <+RealThiele> i get it, but the compass charm makes me :(

[3:58:52] <+PleasantLeech> to me hollow knights biggest flaw was having a dark souls death punishment but having precision platforming. If im going to be dealing with fast insta kills I shouldn't have to walk across the whole map to get back.

[4:04:46] <+RealThiele> bullshit, letting go is part of grief
[4:04:50] <SilverInferno3> This is how Sky Kids 3 starts
[4:04:53] <SilverInferno3> Spy*
[4:04:55] <%Solidnick18> That's not healthy
[4:04:56] <giga_bit> i don't think it's the worst thing ever but it definitely ain't the best

[4:05:39] <+linSP> noooooo
[4:05:45] <ghostspartan80> man that sounds unsettling
[4:05:52] <SilverInferno3> It should be illegal to recreate a dead person without a plethora of licenses

[4:08:24] <AnIrishPapaya> @count_long Damn that one got me
[4:08:31] <BlackermanZX> That sounds like a dangerous idea doodWAT
[4:08:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> Master Oogway

[4:08:44] <+CptnCampy61> I’m sad now

[4:11:03] <+RealThiele> oh god thats right olive garden did a season pass
[4:11:06] <honeyman18> Woolie wants the Breadsticks bad

[4:11:36] <rosabellamelantha> IMMORTAL HULK IS GREAT
[4:11:38] <+IncredibleMeh> ITS REALLY COOL THOUGH
[4:11:38] <BallerSwagBro9k> Marvel doesnt know when to stop

[4:11:42] <SilverInferno3> HULK! *snap* BANNER! *snap*
[4:11:45] <+Masutasodo> Immortal hulk is actually really good
[4:11:46] <peachy996> Marvel is desperate for your attention

[4:11:50] <peachy996> DC too
[4:11:51] <powerprotoman> woolie upset abotu cool shit, enws at eleven
[4:11:59] <honeyman18> Red Hulk was dope for a minute

[4:12:11] <+tearknack> banner! green! grey! red! banner!
[4:12:12] <+IncredibleMeh> hulkbannerbigmanjoebigmanproffessorhulkbannerdevilhulk
[4:12:12] <townzzzzz> mixing game cannon with comic cannon, WRONG
[4:12:13] <Count_Long> I grew up poor, so Olive Garden was super hype rich food to me, and I remember going to one with a bunch of other students in Military tech school, and this Fat Italian woman was bitching that it wasnt REAL italian, and I got heated, for real.
[4:12:14] <%GeneralSCPatton> THE ONE BELOW ALL
[4:12:20] <dekkitout> Reanimator, Woolie
[4:12:28] <+DesertPenguin> Is that what it's really doing right now?
[4:12:32] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @aceleapc
[4:12:33] <+paladinstarbuster> A LOT
[4:12:34] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1227284596695404550?s=19
[4:12:34] <powerprotoman> woolie you JUST PLAYED DOOM
[4:12:34] <$Swish20XX> Because shut up it's cool
[4:12:36] <SilverInferno3> Make magic cool by making it science. Make science cool by making it magic. The cycle persists
[4:12:37] <+CptnCampy61> Marvel comics...
[4:12:41] <peachy996> Comics are dumb Woolie
[4:12:50] <peachy996> Not every comic is Watchmen
[4:12:54] <%Prevot> when are comics NOT stupid?
[4:12:56] <$cherubs_anonymous> It's very stupid and bad, don't listen to them Woolie
[4:12:57] <$Swish20XX> Don't think about it
[4:12:57] <Literal___Nobody> What about the red hulk venom ghost rider fusion?
[4:12:59] <+RealThiele> Star Trek ispires science to make Star Trek which inspires science
[4:13:01] <+IncredibleMeh> It is very cool and Devil Hulk is an amazing character
[4:13:01] <whazat> hell powered hulk would be a good what-if
[4:13:02] <rcand9> let hell into your hulk heart
[4:13:04] <honeyman18> Hulk had a wife and kid die in his arms, I think they ran the gamut by now
[4:13:08] <ghostspartan80> comics are dumb what else is new
[4:13:08] <%jiggy_snipe> is this cool dumb tho?
[4:13:09] <SilverInferno3> SPIDERGOD
[4:13:13] <This_is_Marco> Immortal hulk run went more horror than anything tbh
[4:13:17] <$Swish20XX> Spidersman
[4:13:18] <Count_Long> Does Hell Hulk rip/tear?
[4:13:22] <%Dash_rendar89> To be fair, it's def worth a read and still has the science vibe. It's like a horror movie Hulk
[4:13:27] <ghostspartan80> RADIOACTIVE SEMEN
[4:13:29] <%GeneralSCPatton> SPIDER TOTEM
[4:13:37] <dekkitout> Also, Eddie Brock's son is the Symbiote AntiChrist now...
[4:13:37] <+thesw1tch> that spiderthing is called a web
[4:13:38] <rcand9> hell hulk has huge guts
[4:13:40] <+Muzzle131> its symbolic cant you see
[4:13:43] <Ipsenscastle> It's fucking dumb
[4:13:44] <Count_Long> Never Forget! He killed Mary Jane with his RADIOACTIVE SEMEN
[4:13:44] <BallerSwagBro9k> All superheto get umb eventually
[4:13:47] <zaitje> well comics are very goofy
[4:13:48] <DeathByPoke7> The church of spider men
[4:13:51] <BlackermanZX> Red Hulk... Venom.. Ghost Rider? doodWAT
[4:13:54] <awalr> gotta keep finding new things to cram into the comic
[4:14:04] <$Swish20XX> But if there are infinite realities then what's the matter
[4:14:13] <+linSP> dc 😔
[4:14:21] <dekkitout> Doom's mommy is still trapped in hell iirc
[4:14:22] <rcand9> same universe tho
[4:14:28] <rosabellamelantha> @WoolieVersus Hulk has had shit to do with the supernatural since the early days tho
[4:14:31] <vincerocmm> Woolie the lore slayer
[4:14:36] <pi_in_the_sci> At some point they just desided the spider-sense was magic
[4:14:40] <BallerSwagBro9k> Woolie is super right
[4:14:42] <+Deft_Thought> They did the same shit with Wolverine. All the feral mutants became a race that evolved parallel with humans. Their progenitor was a dude who looked like Wolverine with five claws.
[4:14:59] <+SlappyMeats> mish mash is nonsense, but give me Magitech and we're in business
[4:15:00] <Ipsenscastle> Editing is the most important part of storytelling, and 70 year runs of comics are the exact opposite of that
[4:15:02] <$cherubs_anonymous> Guys Woolie's point is that it doesn't fit tonally
[4:15:04] <gunsrlove> It's just adding too much
[4:15:05] <rcand9> yeah we get you
[4:15:05] <BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[4:15:05] <Shwepie> But the multiverse spider god chose Peter to be a hero!

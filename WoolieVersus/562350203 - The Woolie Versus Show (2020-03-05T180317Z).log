[0:11:25] <%gatorafan> Reggie woolieVS Sleep
[0:11:26] <%Superbro64> Campaign is around 1h 30m if you know what your doing, so this may be the final session

[0:11:27] <chromonaut747> hell yea I love doom mods
[0:11:36] <andrei11dr> Oh ,i didn't see it because i don't want any FF7 spoilers
[0:11:43] <%Superbro64> but that depends if they get stuck on either the bosses or the final bonus stages
[0:11:46] <Hoot_Patoots> also the OST is amazing
[0:11:51] <SeshohoCian> any JTE heads in chat?
[0:11:53] <+mankeyfigh> I‚Äôm such an asshole, but until a game is officially supported, I turn my nose at it
[0:12:07] <uncle_christian> Meatbags XD
[0:12:11] <%gatorafan> @fuqboislim I mean... This is a fangame, you are not going to get much praise for the latest games
[0:12:29] <%gatorafan> from Sonic Team, mind you.
[0:12:31] <am_omega> I see it like this, Sonic has the potential to be great but sadly they fucked up so bad.
[0:12:36] <+mankeyfigh> *up from it
[0:12:45] <uncle_christian> She approved?
[0:12:58] <ScreamLord> "Jumping into that pit seems like a good idea!"
[0:12:58] <%gatorafan> Sonic wants to be cool but SEGA won't let him
[0:12:59] <+MaSterChiEfin420blntNinjA> Woolie has slaves
[0:13:02] <Ner234> OR
[0:13:03] <yet_another_brony> this game has been C&D'd in its 20 years of existance. thats about as official endoresment as you can get from a company
[0:13:05] <hymao> blackjack and hookers
[0:13:07] <BigNerdSam> wait what? Is Woolie playing Waku Waku Patrol Car?
[0:13:08] <%Irridium> look justice needs money too
[0:13:09] <uncle_christian> ca ching
[0:13:10] <%Superbro64> I will say though, unlike base srb2, srb2kart is much more likely to get publisher ire
[0:13:11] <yet_another_brony> *had not
[0:13:13] <andrei11dr> Twerka Corporations at your service
[0:13:16] <+BionoidLCR> its great LUL
[0:13:17] <%SomersaultJustice> you should dance instead in her place
[0:13:19] <fatguysandwich> Sonic has such great potential. As a huge Sonic fan the only one I've enjoyed since Generations is Mania
[0:13:20] <%Superbro64> as srb2kart has nintendo and atlus assets
[0:13:21] <+tuchpi> YEYEYEYE

[0:15:13] <+tuchpi> covid hype
[0:15:16] <%gatorafan> influenza PogChamp
[0:15:18] <yet_another_brony> yea the recent update is nice
[0:15:22] <am_omega> Muv-Luv can fuck you up man.
[0:15:45] <%tearknack> muv luv is like School days meats fucking Starship Troopers
[0:16:01] <%tearknack> meats
[0:16:04] <%Superbro64> You can actually mess with setting to allow more rotating with the simple controls, back when it was a mod @WoolieVersus
[0:16:05] <+Can_Do_Kamel> @captaintitforce no new remix track was 1.75 and new Luka missions was 2 million
[0:16:07] <am_omega> Nah its like fun time dating then 98% Starship Troopers.
[0:16:11] <yet_another_brony> i enjoy the twin stick controls more
[0:16:17] <dabirSA> You can still fully rotate with simple controls, it's just that it follows behind the direction you're moving like a normal game
[0:16:20] <uncle_christian> tank controls?
[0:16:35] <%tearknack> @am_omega i'm referencing School Days in that it has like
[0:16:36] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1234692167358177282?s=19
[0:16:36] <%Superbro64> srb2 2.2 also added in drop shadows, depth control was a problem for me before
[0:16:39] <%tearknack> the ahrd genre change
[0:16:44] <+DreyfussFrost> No harm trying it if it's a toggle.
[0:16:45] <Hoot_Patoots> same for me SUperbro
[0:16:47] <%Superbro64> *depth perception with platforming
[0:16:49] <Hoot_Patoots> very thankful for those shadows
[0:16:49] <%GeneralSCPatton> You think we can make the push to orchestrated theme song at 2.25 million?
[0:16:54] <%Ipsenscastle> the faster you go the more magnetic they should be
[0:16:56] <CaptainTitforce> @can_do_kamel oh yeah sorry mixed you with the Orchestrated thingy
[0:16:59] <Hoot_Patoots> because platforming in srb2 is not really ...easy the more it goes
[0:17:02] <yet_another_brony> oh yeah the update also added drop shadows. pretty great
[0:17:04] <lazuli_alter> @WoolieVersus have you heard of SRB2Kart, the kart racing spinoff game made in the SRB2 engine? I feel like you'd be really interested in it and I can link to the download if you wanna look into it
[0:17:06] <uncle_christian> Lucky Ted?
[0:17:15] <am_omega> Oh that is what you meant.
[0:17:19] <Hoot_Patoots> i'm thinking of adding the modern sonic mod also to try how it would go with like modern homing
[0:17:26] <%Superbro64> srb2kart has far and away more enjoyable controls for me
[0:17:43] <am_omega> I mean that is cool but like the Kart racer is the best.
[0:17:45] <ZoomBuster> I am an SRB2 first person xD
[0:17:56] <dabirSA> there's also a 3d model mod for SRB2, don't know if you're using that, it gives the characters a sega saturn-inspired look
[0:17:59] <%gatorafan> people don't even know there is a Sonic Robo Blast 1 daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:18:05] <am_omega> I remember this and the first game years ago but man the kart game is great.
[0:18:06] <yet_another_brony> yeye some great shit
[0:18:08] <%Superbro64> is srb1 even 3d?
[0:18:11] <lazuli_alter> there's also an Alex mod in srb2kart
[0:18:12] <%jepupu> jiyuFeet woolieREGGIEFUL <3
[0:18:13] <rosabellamelantha> @WoolieVersus yo this puts us one step closer to playing og DOOM, do some DOOM woolie it still holds up
[0:18:19] <ZoomBuster> I'm pretty sure they're gonna do base SRB2 first
[0:18:36] <yet_another_brony> yo uou want some fucking contrast look at srb1
[0:18:38] <am_omega> Yo if we are talking about .Wads then Russian Overkill is the best.
[0:18:43] <%Superbro64> You can rely on us sonic dumpster divers, we IN that sonic fanbase hole
[0:18:50] <ZoomBuster> YESSSSUUUU
[0:18:54] <ZoomBuster> GUD IT'S NEW VERSION
[0:18:55] <%gatorafan> It's sticky down here in the Sonic fandom

[0:19:39] <+ALazo> I sonic telling you ‚Äòno‚Äô
[0:19:40] <am_omega> You gotta dig through the sonic fandom trash to find the gold. Its there just under the mountains of shit and sticky white stuff.
[0:19:49] <uncle_christian> Java
[0:20:02] <%gatorafan> OG energy
[0:20:08] <%Superbro64> man, I want woolie to play version 2.1, 2.2 is SUCH a massive improvement from one update ago
[0:20:17] <%Superbro64> this is essentially srb2.5 as a game
[0:20:19] <%SomersaultJustice> waking up is just chemicals
[0:20:27] <StarlitStunner> stripGood
[0:20:43] <fatguysandwich> Was there a big gap of time between 2.1 and 2.2?
[0:20:43] <Hoot_Patoots> it's crazy to me too since i i was part of the sonic fan game community like 20 years ago
[0:20:49] <Hoot_Patoots> and i remember demo 3 of srb2
[0:20:49] <ZoomBuster> Same same
[0:20:55] <ZoomBuster> S a me
[0:20:59] <Hoot_Patoots> yeah like...5-6 years ?
[0:21:01] <SableS139a> Coffee's one of those drinks that you kinda struggle to drink. You're forced to drink it quickly so it doesn't get cold and become shit, but if you go too fast, you burn your mouth. It fucking sucks.
[0:21:03] <ZoomBuster> Remember the old knuckles sprite?
[0:21:06] <Hoot_Patoots> god
[0:21:08] <%Superbro64> you literally just have to see the first level played of 2.1 on youtube. Such a massive difference @fatguysandwich
[0:21:12] <%SirGO0SE> woolieGLORY
[0:21:17] <Hoot_Patoots> i love that there's still a mod to get old shitty knuckles
[0:21:18] <%gatorafan> woolieGLORY
[0:21:28] <ZoomBuster> Crappy ass knuckles
[0:21:30] <Solidnick18> oh what
[0:21:31] <Vigogs> fucking WHAT
[0:21:34] <ZoomBuster> -- YUP
[0:21:34] <SableS139a> @Hoot_Patoots SRB2's been around since the very late 90s. The game's been around for a couple of decades at this point.
[0:21:34] <Vigogs> THIS GAME?!?!
[0:21:35] <andrei11dr> God damit ,Twitch is acting wonky NotLikeThis
[0:21:35] <%Superbro64> local cooperative is a thing
[0:21:37] <%jiggy_snipe> wow
[0:21:38] <%Superbro64> yup yup
[0:21:40] <pureticly> hook up 20 computers for sonic
[0:21:43] <am_omega> i still remember the Joy of Sonic: Before the Sequel and Sonic: After the Sequel.
[0:21:45] <ZoomBuster> You can have 32 players in this game yup
[0:21:45] <%gatorafan> Sonic LAN parties
[0:21:48] <Ner234> Damn. That's quality
[0:21:49] <Hoot_Patoots> yeah. I mean i remember being on SFGHQ and playing srb1
[0:21:51] <Hoot_Patoots> and other oldies
[0:21:54] <Siregulus> it gets pretty damn unstable at 32 though, so usually people set 30 or 31
[0:21:56] <%jiggy_snipe> sound test very important
[0:21:58] <%jepupu> 32 player Sonic LAN party sounds pretty wild.
[0:22:00] <SableS139a> SRB2's multiplayer options are amazing. Sucks that Circuit Race isn't in atm, though.
[0:22:02] <ZoomBuster> Oh addons are made easier!
[0:22:08] <Vigogs> I played the shit out of this game as a baby

[0:22:44] <andrei11dr> So wat this is a 2d or 3d ?
[0:22:44] <+JuiceBlox> No OC chars? How is this a fan game?
[0:22:56] <Hoot_Patoots> oh believe me there are mods
[0:22:57] <ZoomBuster> It started with 2 or 3, and then it became a whooole team
[0:22:57] <am_omega> The best kind of fan game
[0:22:57] <lazuli_alter> the modding community's got that front covered
[0:22:59] <Hoot_Patoots> for a lot of OC
[0:23:02] <%Superbro64> any doom heads know if theses settings are in base doom fan engines? or is this unique to srb2?
[0:23:06] <SableS139a> @lazuli_alter Would be amazing if this was done by a single person. Let's be real here.

[0:23:39] <yet_another_brony> UHN THIS SONG
[0:23:39] <%Superbro64> reminder that simple controls dont lock air actions to where the camera is facing

[0:23:43] <Drowsy_Deku> wait this isn't race war
[0:23:43] <yet_another_brony> fuck yes
[0:23:46] <+MasterGeneralVic> is it just me or it this super loud
[0:23:48] <andrei11dr> Oh ,this looks cool
[0:23:50] <Solidnick18> sonic runner
[0:23:58] <jorniev> SONIC ETERNAL!
[0:23:58] <%gatorafan> Music Kreygasm
[0:24:00] <+MasterGeneralVic> this is amazing looking
[0:24:03] <SableS139a> @gatorafan I think there's a WAD or a PK3 for that on the forums for donwload.
[0:24:07] <SableS139a> *download
[0:24:11] <%Superbro64> music is a bit loud
[0:24:11] <Hoot_Patoots> this is difficulty spike the level
[0:24:13] <ZoomBuster> Castle Eggman USED to be
[0:24:16] <ZoomBuster> The final boss place
[0:24:20] <ZoomBuster> Then this became a full game
[0:24:27] <%Superbro64> difficulty SPIKES in the final bonus stages I feel
[0:24:28] <metabot64> looks cool but i kinda feel it plays a bit janky
[0:24:31] <%Ecchigun> Route 66
[0:24:34] <%gatorafan> SourPls
[0:24:35] <masterfire23> route 66
[0:24:36] <%SomersaultJustice> get your kicks
[0:24:39] <+Akizea> song is a banger
[0:24:39] <%SirGO0SE> SourPls
[0:24:39] <JAW_Skellyman> Digging the 2D characters in 3D environments. Always a unique look
[0:24:40] <%Superbro64> that and the [REDACTED] boss are real hard
[0:24:41] <Solidnick18> SourPls
[0:24:44] <fatguysandwich> Castle Eggman did seem like a final area when I was playing it then there was more levels and I was so happy
[0:24:59] <pureticly> it's a bit toooo two dimensional those powerup things look hard to hit
[0:25:02] <fatguysandwich> This is definitely one of the best Sonic fan games I've played recently
[0:25:12] <SableS139a> @ZoomBuster We're still waiting on a few more zones & acts though. Red Volcano isn't complete, Egg Rock still needs to be revamped, Dark City is nowhere to be seen, and we only have the music for Grand Eggship Act 1.
[0:25:16] <Duke_of_HI> use Tails?
[0:25:16] <%Superbro64> but oh MAN, there is ONE bonus level that is just something. It takes like 12 minutes to complete blind
[0:25:18] <SableS139a> It's gonna be a bit
[0:25:19] <andrei11dr> Whenever i heard about this game i thought it was like an Sonic Adventure tipe game, but this actually seems pretty fun
[0:25:26] <ZoomBuster> Ooof!
[0:25:31] <%Toasty_tobs> Toasty_tobs subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:25:36] <dabirSA> @pureticly look into the 3d model mod. absolute game changer
[0:25:41] <SableS139a> ^
[0:25:44] <pureticly> whoa
[0:25:47] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:25:54] <%gatorafan> yeah this looks like that Sonic Saturn game prototype, but good
[0:25:54] <ZoomBuster> But all the stuff that's here so far is a big improvement!
[0:26:01] <SableS139a> @ZoomBuster Very much so
[0:26:03] <dabirSA> and check around in the controls, change to simple mode and unlock camera vertlook
[0:26:14] <Hoot_Patoots> i never got how to beat these enemies
[0:26:15] <%Superbro64> @dabirSA counterpoint, 3d models kinda go against woolie's vibe of 3d environments with 2d characters
[0:26:19] <Hoot_Patoots> can you even destroy them without getting hit
[0:26:23] <%Superbro64> that he was praising away last session
[0:26:35] <%Superbro64> so he probably wont touch opengl this session
[0:26:36] <ZoomBuster> TNT
[0:26:44] <+kyh9> Looney-tunes gang
[0:26:44] <dabirSA> if he saw the saturn-style models first he'd be praising that instead
[0:26:46] <Solidnick18> this is a cool level
[0:26:47] <+jiggy_snipe> i'm loving the references in this game
[0:26:50] <lazuli_alter> oh yeah, the Sonic Bible (that's not a joke title btw)
[0:26:53] <chromonaut747> yo this music is bangin
[0:26:54] <%gatorafan> oh yeah, NA Sonic lore daedra1LaughingTibs
[0:26:57] <SableS139a> @Hoot_Patoots Time your jump or a hammer swing. Other than that, shoot them as Fang or use the Insta-Shield if you're running the Renovation mod.
[0:27:07] <fist_wizard_jay> LOL
[0:27:09] <fatguysandwich> Isnt that called the Sonic Bible or something
[0:27:14] <lazuli_alter> yes
[0:27:24] <SableS139a> The NA Sonic Bible is unironically an amazing read.
[0:27:32] <fatguysandwich> I havent read it myself
[0:27:34] <Hoot_Patoots> watch polygon/gilber's video on it
[0:27:40] <Hoot_Patoots> oooh there we go
[0:27:41] <%Superbro64> Bibles arent unique to sonic you know, its a common tool used in developing fiction
[0:27:42] <Hoot_Patoots> PRECISION PLATFORMING
[0:27:43] <NiN10doh_ULTRA_64> That's crazy
[0:27:46] <%Superbro64> but feel free to correct me
[0:27:47] <Solidnick18> oh no
[0:27:53] <SableS139a> Hell, Sonic was planned to be a story book character in one of the Bibles who could seep into the real world.
[0:28:09] <SableS139a> That's what the Shogakukan manga was based off of back in 93 & 94.
[0:28:15] <SableS139a> It's fucking wild.
[0:28:24] <ZoomBuster> ^
[0:28:40] <jorniev> THIS IS A FAKE real STORY
[0:28:52] <%Superbro64> Citation needed
[0:28:53] <zamzoph> D:
[0:29:05] <elicazzz> it's real if you believe hard enough
[0:29:07] <+jiggy_snipe> it's a creepy pasta Kappa
[0:29:11] <%gatorafan> this is going to be fun in the comments
[0:29:17] <SableS139a> It's real if you get high enough
[0:29:30] <metabot64> sonic is 67 years old
[0:29:38] <zamzoph> sonic is a hedgehog. Does age matter?
[0:29:38] <+jiggy_snipe> like Poison Kappa
[0:29:43] <try_it_sis_> wait...what game is this
[0:29:50] <%Superbro64> to be fair, sonic anything gets such a beating by people who dont care for it, if something cool was to come around, takes would get interesting
[0:29:51] <+jiggy_snipe> Sonic Robo Blast 2
[0:29:52] <SableS139a> Sonic was originally 16 and Knuckles was supposed to be 15, but their ages were swapped and became canon.
[0:29:53] <arikk42> is this considered as a good Sonic game ?
[0:30:02] <andrei11dr> I think Reggie just read fanfiction and thought it was official LUL
[0:30:03] <%Superbro64> see: smash player or smash scene bashing
[0:30:19] <Solidnick18> huh
[0:30:30] <SableS139a> @WoolieVersus That is true. Sonic's homeland is Christmas Island.
[0:30:33] <%Superbro64> planet mobius is considered no longer canon by sega officially
[0:30:45] <+theAncopro> and moon is wrecked to this day
[0:30:45] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[0:30:46] <powerprotoman> oh woolie you dont even know about the sonic bible
[0:30:49] <SableS139a> @Superbro64 Yeah. Purely Archie & DiC continuity.
[0:30:49] <dabirSA> planet mobius was archie canon
[0:31:00] <dabirSA> in current sonic canon there's Earth, and there's "Sonic's World" which is NOT called mobius
[0:31:00] <%SomersaultJustice> your version had words?
[0:31:12] <%gatorafan> planet Mobius is old republic Sonic Kappa
[0:31:16] <%Superbro64> all sonic "expanded universe" was banished by sega into the Kenders dimension
[0:31:18] <dabirSA> yuji naka apparently dropped that canon turd on sega right before he quit and they can't get rid of it
[0:31:18] <Hoot_Patoots> lmao
[0:31:19] <%Superbro64> Kappa
[0:31:21] <%SomersaultJustice> I remember that one episode where that country singer put words
[0:31:21] <am_omega> Planet Mobius is like taking the SF american cartoon as canon LUL
[0:31:32] <pureticly> now that's satisfying
[0:31:40] <NobleHeart92> Mobius was the original American canon
[0:31:40] <rosemon5001> a literal looney toons wall lol
[0:31:41] <lazuli_alter> sega's history is actually fraught with a lot of infighting between the different international divisions, it's kinda crazy and a little sad
[0:31:43] <dabirSA> so sonic adventure is on earth, sonic forces is on sonic's world
[0:31:43] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[0:31:45] <$Noponiz> is this a fangame?
[0:31:46] <SableS139a> I think that Mobius was part of the Fleetway canon, but it was much different than what Archie & DiC gave us.
[0:31:47] <andrei11dr> Are we really taking the Sonic canon seriously? Ho gives a fuck the story in Sonic LUL
[0:31:48] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:31:49] <zamzoph> @SomersaultJustice yes, I think that's what he's thinking of. From TAoS
[0:31:51] <Superdandy96> Sonic teaches me that there needs to be a universal bible for a character. Archie cannon, Japan cannon, internet cannon, yeesh.
[0:31:52] <arikk42> is this better than FF7 Remake ?
[0:31:54] <%Superbro64> to be fair, I feel like most of these enemies become less of a problem the more you know the controls
[0:31:59] <+kyh9> @Noponiz yes
[0:32:04] <+jiggy_snipe> damn Wily Coyote is at it for real
[0:32:06] <$Noponiz> looks sick
[0:32:06] <SableS139a> @Noponiz Yep. One that's been around for 20 years at this point.
[0:32:14] <$Noponiz> that's nuts
[0:32:18] <Hoot_Patoots> knock knock
[0:32:24] <$Noponiz> is this a one off stream or a new lp?
[0:32:26] <Vyneci> ...you fist the enemies, Woolie?
[0:32:27] <Hoot_Patoots> oh hey it's best shield
[0:32:30] <+jiggy_snipe> new lp
[0:32:30] <%Parapattern> You DON'T chuckle
[0:32:32] <$Noponiz> that too is sick
[0:32:35] <+jiggy_snipe> this is the 2nd stream
[0:32:38] <%gatorafan> @noponiz seems like full LP
[0:32:38] <%Superbro64> knuckles just literally glides through this entire zone. These levels are CAKE as knuchles
[0:32:40] <JAW_Skellyman> When does roadrunner show up? lol
[0:32:40] <Hoot_Patoots> oh god

[0:32:58] <Hoot_Patoots> sonic robo blast 2
[0:32:59] <Siregulus> PogChamp
[0:33:02] <$Noponiz> @jiggy_snipe i see your name and appreciate it a lot

[0:33:09] <Hoot_Patoots> this part with sonic alone is hell
[0:33:15] <%Superbro64> sonic retro?
[0:33:20] <%Superbro64> ??
[0:33:20] <SableS139a> @jiggy_snipe Sonic was supposed to have his own unique boss fight that would've been a Road Runner chase sequence. Not sure what happened to it exactly, but you can see bits and pieces that still remain in Arid Canyon on the whole now.
[0:33:21] <Hoot_Patoots> probably sonic fan game hq
[0:33:21] <+jiggy_snipe> @Noponiz SeemsGood
[0:33:29] <$Noponiz> did he say "share lewd things"?
[0:33:30] <+megamanx74> shame
[0:33:31] <%SirGO0SE> WOW REG
[0:33:35] <Hoot_Patoots> when it still existed
[0:33:37] <lazuli_alter> wow reggie, so judgemental
[0:33:37] <Vyneci> I already know where this is going
[0:33:41] <%gatorafan> That's fandomcist
[0:33:42] <%Superbro64> sonic fan game hq is probably post srb2 and sonic retro
[0:33:46] <%Superbro64> I am 90% sure
[0:33:46] <Hoot_Patoots> holy shit
[0:33:49] <Prevot> ALWAYS shame people for their sonic shit
[0:33:49] <$Noponiz> LUL
[0:33:50] <%SirGO0SE> here we are supporting your fuckin foot fetish and youre throwin shade at sonic
[0:33:57] <dabirSA> hunting for emblems in this zone as knuckles with simple controls is exactly how he should have felt in sonic adventure
[0:34:01] <SableS139a> b i r b
[0:34:01] <Siregulus> THE BASH
[0:34:02] <Vyneci> That's Sonic rules, spikes don't hurt you from the side

[0:34:11] <spirittiart> Floss
[0:34:15] <+chill_o_wisp> AEROSMISSU
[0:34:18] <$Noponiz> he's going a bit hard with the tails assist
[0:34:20] <SableS139a> @Hoot_Patoots Didn't everyone?
[0:34:22] <%Superbro64> I think thats a knuckles specific path your on woolie
[0:34:22] <Siregulus> shout outs to the BASH that usually doesn't get to do shit
[0:34:40] <$Noponiz> is there any downside aside ruining it for yourself to the tailsassist?
[0:34:50] <SableS139a> @WoolieVersus If you're playing Metal Sonic or Knuckles, that's a feasible route. If not, oh well.
[0:34:51] <%Ecchigun> when this game as been made ?
[0:34:58] <%Ecchigun> YO SUNSET LEVELS
[0:34:58] <Hoot_Patoots> YEE HAW
[0:34:58] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> mmm there's no specific category

[0:35:30] <zamzoph> Mighty barely gets love
[0:35:31] <+kyh9> Sonic Forces?
[0:35:33] <am_omega> Yo Vector is legit the best.
[0:35:34] <%Superbro64> THIS SPECIFIC version of the game came out last year

[0:35:51] <SableS139a> @Ecchigun Yeah. This game's gone through a LOT of updates over the years. This is the most recent version and so much has changed.
[0:35:52] <zafooru> redgehog
[0:35:58] <+kyh9> First image is photo-realistic
[0:35:59] <Superdandy96> Sally‚Äôs only cannon in Archie comics right? She‚Äôs never appeared in actual games right?
[0:35:59] <powerprotoman> the chaotix was originally going to be their own thing but sega cowarded out and made their game "knuckles chatoix"
[0:36:00] <Solidnick18> LUL
[0:36:00] <Hoot_Patoots> the second result on hedgie
[0:36:01] <otterwolfy> omg
[0:36:02] <Hoot_Patoots> reggie
[0:36:04] <Necnill> holy shit, it works
[0:36:06] <Solidnick18> oh no
[0:36:08] <+Noraje> oh no I just found myself
[0:36:11] <am_omega> And Knuckle's Chaotix is a interesting game.
[0:36:13] <%SomersaultJustice> oh no
[0:36:13] <andrei11dr> DO IT REGGIE

[0:36:22] <%gatorafan> mine looks like he's some hedgehogs Vergil
[0:36:28] <fatguysandwich> hahhahah I just looked up my name
[0:36:30] <%Superbro64> being a normal, well adusted sonic fan is suffering NotLikeThis
[0:36:31] <%Ecchigun> Reggie the hedgehog
[0:36:33] <Solidnick18> yep
[0:36:41] <Solidnick18> that's the hedge hole
[0:36:46] <zamzoph> donut steel
[0:36:48] <SableS139a> I remember that character designer. Shit was fun back when I was a kid.
[0:36:57] <%bread_assassin> Bobby the Hedgehog is the absolute worst.
[0:37:09] <%gatorafan> btw, the Chaotix are Genesis era characters
[0:37:27] <am_omega> Well I guess 32x is genesis era.
[0:37:27] <%Superbro64> I really doubt that woolie knows or cares
[0:37:28] <%Ecchigun> what about me @WoolieVersus HUH ?
[0:37:35] <fatguysandwich> I remember playing Chaotix for about 10 minutes at a gaming convention and I hated it
[0:37:40] <fatguysandwich> I could not get into it
[0:37:40] <pureticly> it fucking says that reggie the hedgehog's theme song is it's my life by bon jovi
[0:37:45] <%gatorafan> I'm amazed there are multiples
[0:37:45] <+b_bang_> Darlington the Hegddehog
[0:37:46] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:37:50] <+Mkingston> So your dad drew Woolie the Hedgehog?
[0:37:50] <powerprotoman> why are you looking at porn reggie?
[0:37:53] <SableS139a> Tanner of the North did a miniseries years ago that bashed a lot of poorly made fan characters on the Sonic OC wiki. That was a good time.
[0:37:53] <%Superbro64> chaotix aint a great game, I doubt its even that good
[0:37:54] <Nested_Dreams> Brb, looking for Darlington the Hedgehog
[0:37:59] <%GeneralSCPatton> How many Muhammad the Hedgehogs are there?
[0:37:59] <%gatorafan> and that not most of them are a reference to you
[0:38:00] <CastleGeekSkull> entire civilization's worth of seed have been spilled to sonic OC art
[0:38:06] <%Superbro64> bad sonic games existed in the genesis era too
[0:38:19] <+DreyfussFrost> 420 the Hedgehog is an S Tier OC.
[0:38:25] <%SomersaultJustice> what about billy the hedgehog?
[0:38:32] <fatguysandwich> I feel the same about CD. I love everything about that game but the levels
[0:38:35] <presque> He probably made it himself
[0:38:38] <SableS139a> Yeah. Most of those games were the 8-bit titles and some of the crossover spin-offs.
[0:38:39] <Hoot_Patoots> surprisingly nothing specifically for minh ?
[0:38:40] <%gatorafan> to search for Minh
[0:38:41] <+ggbhtg> WHERE DOES THAT LEAD YOU? BACK TO SONIC lewds
[0:38:48] <+ALazo> Rule 34 corollary: If it exists, there is a sonic OC based on it.
[0:38:48] <CastleGeekSkull> shouts out to Hedgehog the Hedgehog
[0:38:51] <zamzoph> @Superbro64 where does Mean Bean Machine rank?
[0:38:52] <Solidnick18> damn it
[0:38:54] <powerprotoman> well guys you know what to do
[0:38:54] <zafooru> Minh Nho the hedgehog
[0:38:56] <+Mkingston> Time for someone to draw it
[0:38:57] <am_omega> Oh the goal to make Chaotix easy as shit is to play as Charmy and use Heavy. You end up being a flying bee with a unstoppable hammer swinging around.
[0:39:07] <%Superbro64> that's just puyo puyo bruh Kappa
[0:39:08] <+jiggy_snipe> yea I didn't exist at least through google

[0:39:25] <%LordSDB> Not curios enough Reggie
[0:39:27] <zamzoph> @Superbro64 but pingas tho
[0:39:34] <+Mkingston> So HBO are making a Last of Us series. Confirmed.
[0:39:35] <SableS139a> @CastleGeekSkull It's basically Puyo Puyo 2 with a massive reskin. It's hard to play (because Puyo), but it's a really fun spin-off otherwise.
[0:39:35] <Superdandy96> It‚Äôs only a matter of time before Minh the hedgehog is a thing
[0:39:36] <fatguysandwich> I remember googling sonic in school and he was pregnant

[0:40:29] <+jiggy_snipe> Sonic Robo Blast 2
[0:40:37] <+stoutfish> the momentum of these jumps is crazy
[0:40:38] <+jiggy_snipe> it's a fan game
[0:40:40] <ahaegotrigger> paper sonic looks neat
[0:40:41] <SableS139a> Arid Canyon was incomplete until 2.2 dropped back in November.
[0:40:50] <Hoot_Patoots> my ps4 pro hdmi fucking died so i can't play ff7 remake, but at least i can play this when i get home
[0:40:53] <%Superbro64> I will say, I have not SEEN a fanbase MORE THIRSTY for a good recently released 3d sonic game
[0:41:08] <%Superbro64> I've seen enough generations mods to make my eyes bleed NotLikeThis
[0:41:19] <andrei11dr> Olso there's way too much fanart of Sonic being crucified like Jesus LUL
[0:41:21] <+Mkingston> @Hoot_Patoots use a HDMI cable from something else
[0:41:21] <+ggbhtg> I have not seen a fanbase more thirsty
[0:41:21] <+Jaysky> Makes sense @jiggy_snipe ,the art of the characters to the stage is quite different
[0:41:26] <+ggbhtg> end quote
[0:41:27] <+DreyfussFrost> That story could have been the plot of the movie.

[0:41:50] <+HawkGoggles2> Sonic the comic?
[0:41:54] <+ggbhtg> or SPEEDOWAY
[0:41:54] <Siregulus> IDW?
[0:41:55] <Hoot_Patoots> i tried switching all sorts of ports, also safe mode and all the changes i could do
[0:41:57] <%Superbro64> citation needed
[0:41:58] <powerprotoman> oh no reggies reading sonci the comic
[0:41:58] <+Mkingston> @Hoot_Patoots so it's the PS4?
[0:41:59] <muniea3> dr eggman did nothing wrong?
[0:41:59] <pureticly> unleashed seems to cancel a lot of things
[0:42:01] <Nested_Dreams> There isn't a Darlington the hedgehog anywhere :<
[0:42:02] <%gatorafan> I love this fanfic
[0:42:03] <Siregulus> oh it's before archie
[0:42:04] <Hoot_Patoots> i think my ps4 pro's hdmi port is just borked yeah
[0:42:06] <+ggbhtg> oh wait
[0:42:08] <Hoot_Patoots> apparently that happens
[0:42:12] <+ggbhtg> FLEETOWAY SONIC?
[0:42:14] <Hoot_Patoots> so i'm angy
[0:42:15] <am_omega> talking about the super non canon comic LUL
[0:42:18] <SableS139a> @ggbhtg Oh yes
[0:42:20] <redrins> there's also the brit comics
[0:42:21] <Vigogs> reggie sounds like that kid making up shit about games in the playground
[0:42:28] <powerprotoman> FLEEEEETWAAAAY
[0:42:29] <zamzoph> the sonic multiverse
[0:42:33] <+Jaysky> There are many Sonics
[0:42:36] <+stoutfish> sonic from the first game
[0:42:41] <%gatorafan> Fleetway Sonic is... SOMETHING
[0:42:44] <+Jaysky> Not as many Goku's though
[0:42:49] <+ggbhtg> Is it EARTH 42 SONIC?!
[0:42:50] <+Mkingston> Will they reference Sonic Dream Collection in the next movie?
[0:42:55] <+stoutfish> purify the world of all evil sounds like some fash shit
[0:42:56] <zafooru> Kintobor the hedgehog
[0:42:58] <+Jaysky> *many as Goku's
[0:43:10] <zamzoph> is mobius in the IDW comics?
[0:43:11] <SableS139a> Oh yeah, Fleetway Super Sonic was basically a demon god in mortal form since the Chaos Emeralds were super dangerous in Sonic the Comic.
[0:43:11] <%Superbro64> "Hey, sonic threw out full throated hard R's in the promotional material back in the day you know" Reggie probably
[0:43:21] <+jiggy_snipe> Ovi Kappa
[0:43:24] <%gatorafan> that sounds like Fleetway
[0:43:25] <Prevot> that's some dumb shit
[0:43:30] <+stoutfish> terrible back story
[0:43:49] <+paladinstarbuster> Kintobor is an anagram for robotnic
[0:43:56] <%Superbro64> archie comics have been officially discontinued and non canon by sega a while ago
[0:44:01] <andrei11dr> Wasn't there a Sonic cartoon that got canceled because they caught the creators with a shit load of cocaine? LUL
[0:44:03] <dabirSA> anagram? it's just backwards
[0:44:04] <+ggbhtg> Sally will NEVER return, chat
[0:44:05] <%Superbro64> current comics are now published by idw
[0:44:17] <%gatorafan> Archie Sonic is LONG, it had MANY guys writing it
[0:44:17] <am_omega> TITAN Tales.
[0:44:19] <%Superbro64> Sally stans stay loosing Kappa
[0:44:20] <+paladinstarbuster> enerjak?
[0:44:23] <Skeletonmanners> SCOURGE THE HEDGEHOG
[0:44:28] <+HawkGoggles2> Woolie doesn't know about the dark times before Ian Flyn.
[0:44:33] <%Superbro64> yo, scourge is good though
[0:44:46] <fatguysandwich> I didn't read Archie comics. I read the one that they published in the UK
[0:44:46] <zamzoph> Mammoth Mogul was a cool Archie-original villain
[0:44:47] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1234692167358177282?s=19
[0:44:49] <+theAncopro> RIP Sally
[0:44:56] <am_omega> Lets talk about Titan Tails though Kappa
[0:44:59] <fatguysandwich> My dad had a collection of them
[0:44:59] <+stoutfish> this level design is oof
[0:45:02] <%Superbro64> Ian Flyn does good work, that man carries the franchise
[0:45:08] <SableS139a> @Superbro64 I think Archie Sonic capped off at 295 mainline issues, though I may be a little off. The next issue was supposed to cover SegaSonic the Hedgehog Arcade, but it never came to fruition.
[0:45:08] <+Mkingston> I wish IDW would hurry up and publish Batman/The Maxx: Arkham Dreams (Hardcover)
[0:45:10] <%Ipsenscastle> There were UK only Sonic comics called Sonic the Comic and they were fucking nuts
[0:45:17] <yet_another_brony> the level design is great
[0:45:24] <Siregulus> bad feeling that woolie's about to (understandably) credit feed to this upcoming segment
[0:45:27] <fatguysandwich> Yeah Super Sonic was wild in that comic
[0:45:33] <yet_another_brony> woolies just kinda goin off every main path
[0:45:33] <fatguysandwich> Just to name one thing
[0:45:36] <+TopTieramisu> F
[0:45:42] <zafooru> What game is this?
[0:45:45] <+stoutfish> who was the guy who made 40 knuckles and had really dumb ideas about sonic, and drew ugly mutant waifu
[0:45:46] <%Ipsenscastle> @fatguysandwich with the swirly eyes!
[0:45:49] <am_omega> Of course the UK would make their own Sonic comics.
[0:45:51] <SableS139a> Same goes for Sonic Mega Drive issue 3. The miniseries was concluded before it could be completed.
[0:45:54] <+paladinstarbuster> Dark Super sonic from Sonic X

[0:46:02] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 46 minutes and 3 seconds
[0:46:04] <SailorMarsMTL> wow srb2 looks sick now
[0:46:07] <am_omega> If I recall the UK also made their own Ys games for some damn reason.
[0:46:13] <%gatorafan> I liked Finitevus daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:46:17] <%Superbro64> Toei sonic stans rise up
[0:46:18] <Solidnick18> not lanky long sonic
[0:46:20] <%GeneralSCPatton> @stoutfish Oh yeah, he made his own original comic Do Not Steal
[0:46:20] <SableS139a> @am_omega Did they really?
[0:46:21] <draykon> A bunch of the other Sonic designs are mods on the official forums
[0:46:25] <darkryu31765> Hi everyone
[0:46:27] <NiN10doh_ULTRA_64> Chubby Sonic doodGood
[0:46:31] <Vigogs> Toei Sonic is the ideal sonic
[0:46:32] <am_omega> yeah I learned that recently.
[0:46:37] <+paladinstarbuster> chubby sonic is just young sonic why mania and forces made the distinction IDK
[0:46:38] <yet_another_brony> woolie this game was in development when this was modern
[0:46:42] <%Superbro64> I do like both sonics.
[0:46:43] <SableS139a> @GeneralSCPatton The one with the horrible redesigns by Penders?
[0:46:44] <shaggycactus> classic v modern
[0:46:48] <Hoot_Patoots> toei sonic is also my fav design
[0:46:58] <+NekoNinja13> OVA sonic is best sonic
[0:47:02] <%Superbro64> I will say, in retrospect I think boom sonic looks "fine", and that scares me
[0:47:02] <Hoot_Patoots> ye that one
[0:47:03] <+ggbhtg> it was ONE GUY who made tons of Knuckles lore in the comic.
[0:47:06] <%Superbro64> I have become numb
[0:47:07] <SableS139a> Toei Sonic & Saturn Sonic are god tier Classic designs.
[0:47:11] <+stoutfish> there was a sonic comic that had to explain why things were different in adventure
[0:47:19] <Hoot_Patoots> toei/OVA sonic and saturn era
[0:47:20] <%tearknack> @paladinstarbuster yeah that was always my interpretation as well
[0:47:21] <%Superbro64> Saturn sonic IS god tier
[0:47:23] <+stoutfish> so sonic ran around the universe and that's why he looks different
[0:47:26] <fatguysandwich> The Sonic OVA is my guilty pleasure. I just adore it for some reason.
[0:47:34] <zamzoph> @stoutfish like Amy being magically aged up?
[0:47:35] <+MajiOMNI> Tyson Sonic is good
[0:47:36] <andrei11dr> Im probably gonna get shit on for this ,but Adventure sucks donkey nuts !
[0:47:36] <rockmansrb2> Yo Woolie, how's SRB2?
[0:47:40] <+TopTieramisu> black eyed sonic is the only sonic
[0:47:41] <+ggbhtg> all that Knuckles lore is lawyer locked by ONE GUY
[0:47:42] <+theAncopro> cause has a sweet cowboy hat
[0:47:50] <+stoutfish> @zamzoph oh yeah, dumb stuff like that
[0:47:50] <Hoot_Patoots> Tyson is really good yeah, it's really close to the Toei version
[0:47:51] <+NekoNinja13> @fatguysandwich dont feel guilty, its honest fun
[0:47:52] <+Mkingston> Jojo has been added to Netflix UK. Damn the English dub is hilarious .
[0:47:58] <redrins> thats generations
[0:48:05] <SableS139a> The OVA's a fun watch. Wish that we got an official soundtrack release and some new episodes, but it just didn't sell well enough in Japan back in 96.
[0:48:10] <%tearknack> all that Knuckles lore was shit anyways
[0:48:12] <%Superbro64> Tyson sonic is super saiyan god super saiyan tier
[0:48:14] <am_omega> Yeah and Generations was fun.
[0:48:16] <Vigogs> Forces fucked up everything with the two dimensions retcon
[0:48:23] <+TopTieramisu> tyson's sonic animations are amazing
[0:48:28] <+TopTieramisu> i wish they'd make more of those
[0:48:33] <am_omega> Then Forces ruined everything.
[0:48:36] <%Superbro64> forces being the last mainline sonic game irks me something big
[0:48:37] <emeraldskrull> why is woolie so elitist?
[0:48:41] <%gatorafan> it was a team effort
[0:48:50] <SableS139a> @Superbro64 He pretty much takes the best from every official version of Classic Sonic and blends it all together. Tyson's out here doing god's work.
[0:48:52] <%Superbro64> tyson sonic is slightly different from classic
[0:48:59] <%Felhad> woolieSMUG
[0:49:05] <andrei11dr> He should've never talked
[0:49:10] <+theAncopro> mania sonic id say is closer to cd/ova sonic
[0:49:19] <fatguysandwich> Forces was just really bland. I liked the character creator but I just flew through that game and I barely remember it.
[0:49:21] <zamzoph> I never thought "he doesn't talk" as a Sonic trait because of the comic and cartoons
[0:49:23] <+stoutfish> sonic forces is free on ps+ so you can enjoy that three hour game
[0:49:33] <+TopTieramisu> "enjoy"
[0:49:40] <+ggbhtg> You thought Sonic was dead but Hesse and Whitehead and the 5000 fan games said I NEVER FREEZE
[0:49:42] <resloxxx> We dont talk about that
[0:49:43] <am_omega> Oh yeah Forces is like stupid short.
[0:49:43] <HairballCT> or kissing human girls
[0:49:45] <%Superbro64> sometimes I wake up in a cold sweat and remember there was a sonic boom game for the wii u
[0:49:46] <+theAncopro> or a human girlfriend-- oh wait
[0:49:47] <Hoot_Patoots> i mean, i don't mind alt gameplays, like knuckles treasure hunt

[0:50:03] <+paladinstarbuster> speak for yourself woolie Super knight sonic was the shit
[0:50:07] <Siregulus> he does @ChaosEmralds
[0:50:10] <am_omega> Colors was great.
[0:50:13] <%Superbro64> @Akizea I dislike colors' humor though
[0:50:14] <zafooru> Would people rather Sonic just be safe and as successful as mario? I dunno, i kinda like that sonic is riddled with garbage and filth
[0:50:17] <%Superbro64> colors is fine
[0:50:19] <yet_another_brony> JUMP
[0:50:20] <Vigogs> even the bad sonic games sell a fuckton, so quality unfortunately doesn't matter for current day sonic
[0:50:23] <+jiggy_snipe> wow Woolie
[0:50:24] <fatguysandwich> Everyone I see on Twitter really doesn't like Colours but I still really enjoy it
[0:50:25] <SableS139a> Forces could've been something good, but it's just so fucking mid. An overhaul mod being made on the free time of fans is a much better version. Overclocked is gonna be sick.
[0:50:27] <+ggbhtg> nobody spoke ill of Colors

[0:51:09] <+TopTieramisu> super mario 64 is an amazing game
[0:51:14] <%Superbro64> main, the reddit is going to be INTERESTING when woolie mentions sonic next week
[0:51:14] <+Iambobbyjo> *TAILS WILL NOW DIE FOR YOU*
[0:51:22] <Alexm305> colors is good the unleashed dudes like to shit talk it because boosting takes passenger seat to wisps
[0:51:28] <draykon> Any plans on looking into the mods for this game?
[0:51:28] <%gatorafan> 64 is cool.
[0:51:37] <draykon> There's actually a ton of content for it
[0:51:38] <+TopTieramisu> 64 is a transformative game
[0:51:45] <%Ecchigun> 64 is hot stuff
[0:51:52] <%Superbro64> I got into games playing 64 ds
[0:51:52] <%Ecchigun> first game that people played on the console
[0:51:52] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:51:53] <HolisticField> i could never get into sm64 : /
[0:51:53] <+TopTieramisu> changed the way 3d games played
[0:52:01] <%Superbro64> underrated game SeemsGood
[0:52:03] <+theAncopro> i still give unleashes a lot of credit cause it followed up Sonic 06 and was a huge improvement
[0:52:03] <+ggbhtg> Coming soon to the SubReddit, Amy dressed as Rouge: NEXT WAVE
[0:52:05] <%gatorafan> I never got to try the portable version that had Wario and stuff
[0:52:07] <+Mkingston> My cousins did. They had nothing but shit games for their N64 apart from Goldeneye and Diddy Kong Racing (not Mario Kart).
[0:52:14] <Siregulus> it's almost comical how easy it is to accidentally thok
[0:52:22] <Prevot> pretty much every 3D game we play today is standing on the shoulders of mario 64 and ocarina
[0:52:32] <SableS139a> I can respect 64 for what it did, it's just not a Mario game I'd go back to over other 3D installments.
[0:52:33] <+TopTieramisu> yep
[0:52:41] <+TopTieramisu> behind every souls game is ocarina
[0:52:43] <zamzoph> camera control was kinda funky though
[0:52:46] <%Superbro64> my youtube recommendations is currently full of sonic riders high level gameplay
[0:52:47] <+stoutfish> I'm not interested in play 64 in 2020
[0:52:49] <%Superbro64> life is wierd
[0:52:52] <%FuqBoiSlim> the ds version of 64 is alright but I'd play it on a 3ds or something with a circle pad
[0:52:54] <%Ecchigun> dpad was useless tho
[0:52:54] <Alexm305> I wouldn't say so but those games are legendary on a influential scale
[0:52:56] <yet_another_brony> pfft
[0:52:58] <0rond> it's so weird that like, "3rd person" was such an alien concept that mario 64 had to canonize it in order for people to understand it
[0:53:00] <+ggbhtg> @mkingston buck bumble wasnt THAT bad Kappa
[0:53:22] <andrei11dr> Funny enough i played way more Of Crystal Shards than Mario 64
[0:53:25] <Louie_Salmon> Mario 64 still has the highest ceiling of 3D platforming gameplay, don't even get me started on parallel universes
[0:53:25] <am_omega> Poor Glover, shafted but could have had a really fun sequel.
[0:53:26] <+stoutfish> how long has woolie spent on this level? 40 minutes?
[0:53:26] <Solidnick18> what
[0:53:27] <+TopTieramisu> 3d games existed before it... but it was full of uncontrollable cameras and tank controls
[0:53:27] <+ggbhtg> @0rond this is DIFFERENT

[0:53:49] <kingbaconcrispy> What is this mod?
[0:53:49] <0rond> yeah
[0:53:50] <Superdandy96> The first 3D Mario game I played was Sunshine.
[0:53:53] <+NekoNinja13> I personally think ocarina is over rated, butI understand and respect what it is
[0:53:53] <%Superbro64> sonic riders zero g "aquatic time" is a god tier sonic music track
[0:53:57] <zamzoph> Tails had his own Game Gear game
[0:54:04] <+ggbhtg> TAILS NEVER FAILS
[0:54:08] <SableS139a> Super Mario All-Stars was my first mainline Mario title. Think I was 7 or 8 when I played it back at my cousin's place.
[0:54:08] <0rond> this is "old" 3d, this is basically an fps game with the camera pulled back a bit
[0:54:10] <DaKnightWarrior> when did this stream start?
[0:54:10] <Prevot> the good thing about starting with Sunshine is you can only go up from there
[0:54:23] <Â§©‰Ωø42199> sunshine was awesome
[0:54:28] <%Superbro64> fun fact, the thunder shield special action is the sonic adventure homing dash
[0:54:36] <Alexm305> I love the bgm of the first track in zrg
[0:54:41] <SableS139a> Sunshine's good if you're just trying to complete the main game. It's awful if you're going for 100% completion.
[0:55:04] <fatguysandwich> I completed Sunshine 100% and I felt empty for about a week
[0:55:05] <+jiggy_snipe> @kingbaconcrispy Sonic Robo Blast 2, fan game, uses DOOM engine
[0:55:05] <+TheLastStar> but Sonic Colors tho...
[0:55:05] <Prevot> we still haven't gotten yoshi and kirby in 3d
[0:55:10] <Â§©‰Ωø42199> its surprisingly brutal for some shines
[0:55:14] <%FuqBoiSlim> shout out to somecallmejohnny for 100%ing sunshine in one sitting for the kids
[0:55:15] <+TopTieramisu> tbh, it's not fair to compare sonic to mario. think of how many innovative games mario has in his lineup
[0:55:19] <draykon> If Woolie first tries this minecart section I'm gonna be so mad
[0:55:19] <+ggbhtg> CAN'T BELIEVE Sonic 3 stole the homing atk from SA1 Kappa
[0:55:21] <+TopTieramisu> it's basically unfair for any franchise
[0:55:25] <am_omega> At the time, then Rare got their shit together and made some great games.
[0:55:26] <%Superbro64> there are very few games that attempt/are successful with momentum based platforming
[0:55:32] <+TheLastStar> LUL
[0:55:36] <Superdandy96> Looking back, I just like how different it is compared to current Mario games. Plus I grew up near the coast so it felt close to me, you know?
[0:55:38] <Alexm305> sadly
[0:55:40] <Solidnick18> oops
[0:55:42] <%Superbro64> this section is tricky blind
[0:55:43] <Explodincatz> more like jumped the Kart
[0:55:48] <kingbaconcrispy> @jiggy_snipe Thanks, that's nice
[0:55:54] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah no
[0:55:56] <Prevot> DK64 is pure trash
[0:56:06] <+ggbhtg> DK64 was TOO feature length
[0:56:06] <+chill_o_wisp> FUCK OFF DK64 IS PERFECT
[0:56:08] <SableS139a> @Prevot Kirby's been testing the waters with a few games so far, but we don't have any 3D mainline Kirby titles so far. Yoshi's pretty much always stuck to 2D as far as I know.
[0:56:09] <+TopTieramisu> dkc2 is the epitome of rare
[0:56:11] <kingbaconcrispy> @fatguysandwich It's folly to finish sunshine 100%
[0:56:11] <zamzoph> I liked DK64....
[0:56:12] <%SomersaultJustice> I didn't know people hated that game until I started using the internet
[0:56:13] <+thewrongesttrousers> DK64 is quite bad
[0:56:16] <0rond> YOU KNOW HIM WELL
[0:56:16] <EnlightenedKramer> what game is this?
[0:56:16] <Alexm305> üí•
[0:56:18] <Prevot> I want a new 3D DK but I'm afraid they'd try to make it similar in any way to 64
[0:56:20] <%Ecchigun> DK64 has the DK RAP
[0:56:21] <am_omega> DK64 had a lot of fun ideas but it has issues. A lot of issues.
[0:56:21] <fatguysandwich> I thought I was the only one that disliked DK64 lol
[0:56:23] <%Ecchigun> best game
[0:56:24] <Solidnick18> DK64 was pretty fun
[0:56:26] <%Superbro64> nice woolie LUL
[0:56:30] <Louie_Salmon> DK rap does save it
[0:56:31] <Skeletonmanners> DK 64 is not great but its incredibly impressive for its time
[0:56:36] <NiN10doh_ULTRA_64> yovgDK
[0:56:39] <SableS139a> And then there's Chunky
[0:56:39] <zamzoph> @WoolieVersus Didn't the game include the Expansion Pack for more RAM because there was a memory leak?
[0:56:40] <am_omega> But DK64 is full meme worthy.
[0:56:41] <+theAncopro> as a kid who wants a game that goes for years that game was great
[0:56:41] <+LoganWulfric> LoganWulfric subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:56:41] <+thewrongesttrousers> DK64 DID have the DK Rap which makes its existence worth while but that's it
[0:56:43] <SableS139a> H e ' s D e a d
[0:56:45] <draykon> life monitors respawn too. So you can get infinite tries on this section if you do that every time
[0:56:45] <+Mkingston> Most N64 games are shit if you go back and play them now.
[0:56:45] <Superdandy96> I missed out DK64. Still love the country games<3
[0:56:47] <+ggbhtg> DK64 has """""replay value"""""
[0:56:53] <Alexm305> üí•üí•üí•üí•
[0:56:56] <%HeavyMetalIceCream> he dead
[0:56:59] <+stoutfish> this is a bit much for a sonic game no?
[0:57:03] <andrei11dr> DK 64 was fine if you want a shit Banjo game LUL
[0:57:06] <+TopTieramisu> dk64 was a prototype for banjo kazooie
[0:57:07] <%Superbro64> I will say, the low gamma in srb2 in general with some environments is ROUGH
[0:57:09] <fatguysandwich> Tropical Freeze is one of the top tier platformers
[0:57:12] <%Superbro64> you cant see shit sometimes
[0:57:16] <Alexm305> üí•
[0:57:21] <fatguysandwich> The 2D Donkey Kong games are all so good
[0:57:22] <Alexm305> LUL
[0:57:22] <%Superbro64> gosh darn doom engine fog
[0:57:23] <Skeletonmanners> OH KAY
[0:57:23] <0rond> by replay value you must mean the most forced and horrid back trackingever invented
[0:57:24] <JayPastaForce> Ye yeye
[0:57:25] <Louie_Salmon> Wait that was actually on TV?
[0:57:27] <kingbaconcrispy> Oh God no...
[0:57:30] <Solidnick18> i loved that show
[0:57:30] <+BionoidLCR> ill give you a banana slamma Kreygasm
[0:57:33] <Superdandy96> Yo, anyone else remember Ristar?!
[0:57:34] <+Mkingston> Conker's Bad Fur Day LP when?
[0:57:36] <%FuqBoiSlim> I shower you in coconut cream pieeees Kreygasm
[0:57:36] <+stoutfish> the dk show was hideous
[0:57:37] <%tearknack> i love DK show King K Rool
[0:57:39] <draykon> It's rendering a 256-color palette, so you literally lose color detail when you turn down the brightness
[0:57:40] <+theAncopro> all dk says is okay and YEEEaaH
[0:57:41] <zamzoph> oh god, french singing
[0:57:44] <%LoganWulfric> woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:57:48] <kingbaconcrispy> I listened to that cartoon in both languages. Wollie be my coconut.
[0:57:50] <%Parapattern> I remember playing and loving DK64 with my brother when I was really young. Instead of playing the game, though, we used the characters to play out our own little scenarios and games.
[0:57:51] <fatguysandwich> I have one of those DKC dvds
[0:57:53] <+chill_o_wisp> it's not that bad.....
[0:57:53] <am_omega> DK only says "Yeah" and "Okay"
[0:57:54] <resloxxx> Fun level
[0:57:55] <KeiPrime> that dkc show was like 5 years too late
[0:57:56] <fatguysandwich> Raider of the Lost Banana
[0:57:56] <yet_another_brony> HERE WE GO
[0:57:58] <+TopTieramisu> that was a great ending segment
[0:57:59] <zafooru> These acts are really long!
[0:58:01] <am_omega> Its meme worthy as shit.
[0:58:01] <%SomersaultJustice> Our love of Woolie is stronger than a Golden Banana
[0:58:05] <Superdandy96> I‚Äôll shower you in Coconut cream pie KappaPride
[0:58:07] <0rond> YEYEYEYE FANG
[0:58:07] <draykon> Time for an obscure Sonic pick
[0:58:07] <%FuqBoiSlim> I SAW A TRAIN. TRAIN BOSS?!
[0:58:11] <andrei11dr> Somehow I've never seen any videogame cartoon, except for the Kirby anime
[0:58:12] <+TopTieramisu> F.A.N.G.
[0:58:12] <Solidnick18> YEYEYEYE FANG

[0:58:19] <powerprotoman> Fang the sniper a clasic sonic villain
[0:58:21] <zamzoph> Isn't it Nack?
[0:58:22] <%GeneralSCPatton> FANG FIGHT? FIGHT FUCK?
[0:58:24] <%Superbro64> sega refuses to believe that OTHER genesis era characters exist, its funny
[0:58:26] <+stoutfish> IT'S NO USE
[0:58:29] <%Superbro64> more props to mania
[0:58:30] <+stoutfish> TAKE THIS
[0:58:35] <0rond> shadow was a mistake, it should have been FANG
[0:58:37] <powerprotoman> nack is another name for fang
[0:58:39] <KeiPrime> when ray the flying squirrel tho
[0:58:41] <fatguysandwich> I played a Sonic game on the PS2 collection and Fang was in it
[0:58:42] <%tearknack> okay imma be honest
[0:58:46] <fatguysandwich> Cant remember what it was though
[0:58:46] <Alexm305> LUL
[0:58:47] <%tearknack> i have no idea who this is
[0:58:48] <SableS139a> For his neutral special, Fang uses a g u n
[0:58:49] <Prevot> sonic is not faster than GUN
[0:58:52] <%Superbro64> screw you, shadows cool doodScrub
[0:58:52] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[0:58:58] <zamzoph> I came here to laugh at you.
[0:58:58] <%tearknack> lol moobot
[0:58:59] <%FuqBoiSlim> @fatguysandwich was it triple trouble?
[0:59:02] <%gatorafan> Fang used GUN before it was cool, then uncool, then cool again
[0:59:05] <KeiPrime> th..thanks moobot
[0:59:07] <Alexm305> Nack attack LUL
[0:59:14] <0rond> I want to live in the timeline where fang replaced shadow as the rival
[0:59:14] <+TopTieramisu> gun was never not cool
[0:59:15] <am_omega> Fang was in one of the Gamegear Sonic games.
[0:59:20] <Siregulus> there are no guns in SRB2, only cork pistols
[0:59:21] <%Superbro64> who remembers that the usa goverment in sa2 was literally called G.U.N.
[0:59:22] <lefteron> whats this?
[0:59:25] <powerprotoman> fang the sniper aka nack the weasle a jerboa(yes i know i said his anme was knack the weale but hes a jerboa like how flaco is a phesant and not a falcon)
[0:59:26] <Superdandy96> The polar bear should‚Äôve been knuckles rival
[0:59:28] <SableS139a> @fatguysandwich Sonic Gem's Collection. I'm guessing you played either Sonic the Fighters or Sonic Triple Trouble.
[0:59:30] <%SomersaultJustice> fang was in Triple Trouble
[0:59:32] <%Ipsenscastle> triple trouble I think
[0:59:32] <+TopTieramisu> MGS4

[0:59:48] <%SomersaultJustice> it was like the only game gear game I owned other than super columns
[0:59:52] <Solidnick18> good job tails
[0:59:53] <%FuqBoiSlim> This is the Vergil 2 of sonic games
[0:59:56] <%Superbro64> as far as rivals go, metal sonic is the classic
[0:59:57] <fatguysandwich> I played the fighting game with Fang
[1:00:01] <fatguysandwich> That sure was a game
[1:00:07] <Alexm305> 6 shooter and bombs???
[1:00:09] <%Superbro64> metal sonic is my character
[1:00:13] <zafooru> this game could really use Z targeting
[1:00:18] <+ggbhtg> SONIC the fighters
[1:00:20] <+tuchpi> OH NO
[1:00:21] <+ggbhtg> aka

[1:00:58] <%FuqBoiSlim> Ayyyy this kinda groovy
[1:00:58] <0rond> shadow the hedgehog was a mistake,it should have been Fang the sniper
[1:00:59] <lefteron> @WoolieVersus What is this?
[1:00:59] <fatguysandwich> I wish there would be an actually good Sonic fighting game. They have the roster for it
[1:01:00] <Louie_Salmon> Many
[1:01:00] <+TheLastStar> Lava Reef Zone?
[1:01:08] <draykon> Previous versions of this game had actual buttrock for this stage
[1:01:13] <+stoutfish> sonic the fighterz
[1:01:14] <+ggbhtg> FANG MODE IS NOW SELECTABLE
[1:01:15] <SableS139a> Red Volcano's actually a semi-complete level now. All we're missing are Act 2 and a boss.
[1:01:18] <%SomersaultJustice> I'm kinda surprised sega hasn't tried to make a smash clone
[1:01:26] <%Parapattern> What are Fang's movement mechanics?
[1:01:26] <%Superbro64> lets be fair here, there is only one good sonic character and her name is Blaze the Cat
[1:01:28] <draykon> Tails' job is to disrespect the level designers
[1:01:35] <%Superbro64> best female sonic character
[1:01:36] <%FuqBoiSlim> TYBT THANK YOU BASED TAILS üôèüèøüôèüèøüôèüèø
[1:01:36] <fatguysandwich> I know theres a fan making a fighting game right now
[1:01:40] <Alexm305> spring tail
[1:01:41] <+TopTieramisu> @SomersaultJustice too late at this point. sonic's already in smash
[1:01:43] <somariman> Wow, this level changed a lot.
[1:01:46] <KeiPrime> sega made the original crossover fighting game, fighters megamix
[1:01:46] <dabirSA> I remember when this game had three zones and two of them sucked
[1:01:47] <am_omega> I did like Future Trun- I mean Silver Kappa
[1:01:48] <SableS139a> Also the lava is actually lava instead of reskined water, so if you take a hit, you won't sink, but you're Rings are gonzo.
[1:01:51] <+ggbhtg> @somersaultjustice uuuuuh, Sonic Battle??
[1:01:56] <+stoutfish> i mean most sonic characters are trash so it's hard to do better than blaze
[1:01:58] <KeiPrime> well in company crossover
[1:02:00] <+TopTieramisu> at this point, a sonic smash game would look like a spinoff of smash
[1:02:01] <%Superbro64> @dabirSA LUL must of been before my time
[1:02:06] <%gatorafan> @fatguysandwich we had a GIFG episode of that game, is SUPER COOL
[1:02:12] <zafooru> lava and nothing
[1:02:19] <dabirSA> there was a secret red volcano where all the lava was extremely hot extremely deep water
[1:02:22] <+stoutfish> devs had to nerf metal sonic times
[1:02:22] <dabirSA> with no way out
[1:02:28] <KeiPrime> konami made the first in company cross over i think with fuckin wai wai world
[1:02:29] <dabirSA> so if you fell in you just had to sit there and die
[1:02:37] <+Superbro64> reminder that blaze is the one of two characters in the entirety of the sonic franchise that had an actual character arc
[1:02:45] <SableS139a> @TopTieramisu Even though we have Sonic Smackdown, I'd take a Sonic fighting game styled after Dengeki Bunko or Melty Blood.
[1:02:51] <+ggbhtg> devs had to nerf metal sonic LIVE ON STREAM
[1:02:55] <draykon> Doesn't blaze have two contradictory backstories?
[1:02:56] <0rond> FOR GLORY
[1:02:58] <+jiggy_snipe> ohwow your rings are just gone
[1:02:59] <andrei11dr> Is all the music actually original or is from other Sonic games?

[1:03:10] <draykon> Music is all original
[1:03:10] <DaKnightWarrior> lytALRIGHT
[1:03:15] <am_omega> Yes Blaze has a 06 backstory and a Rush backstory.
[1:03:18] <%SomersaultJustice> @ggbhtg I guess, but that's not really the same
[1:03:23] <+thackattack00> They rub it on themselves
[1:03:24] <SableS139a> @WoolieVersus Hedgehogs will also annoint themselves to make their spines clean, yet poisonous, and they'll even eat their young if there's not a lot of food around.
[1:03:26] <%Superbro64> @draykon sega doesnt know what to do with blaze OR silver really
[1:03:35] <SubjectX07x> Yes it is Reggie.
[1:03:37] <fatguysandwich> Rush was sick. I played the hell out of the first one
[1:03:40] <zafooru> ! E D G E !
[1:03:42] <+ggbhtg> Not DeviantArt....e621, however....
[1:03:42] <0rond> you heard it here first folks, hedgehogs mash their poop into paste FOR GLORY
[1:03:49] <SableS139a> @ggbhtg DON'T
[1:03:55] <%Superbro64> sega also currently banned eggman nega from existence
[1:03:57] <Alexm305> rush 1>2 LuvCool
[1:03:59] <%gatorafan> That Sonic vs Blaze fight was a thing huh? daedra1DerpyTibs
[1:04:00] <floralkami> says you, reggie
[1:04:01] <%FuqBoiSlim> it's really weird how they changed up Blaze's backstory not even a year after she first appeared
[1:04:06] <am_omega> I mean Silver is just Future Trunks the Hedgehog.
[1:04:07] <%Superbro64> reminder there is a character called eggman nega
[1:04:10] <KeiPrime> eggman nega shows up in fuckin Mario and Sonic 2020
[1:04:14] <draykon> most levels have little lips of like grass or something to indicate the edge of platforms
[1:04:20] <KeiPrime> He's a KArate only character
[1:04:22] <+stoutfish> which makes blaze future mai
[1:04:24] <fatguysandwich> Wasn't Eggman Nega in the PSP game?
[1:04:24] <draykon> But I guess they couldn't think of something to use for rock
[1:04:28] <%Superbro64> I say that name and I crack up
[1:04:30] <+DisasterJensen> is this a 3d game with the 2d style?
[1:04:32] <+Quarkee> are you going to talk about the real best thing that came out of this game? The cart racer
[1:04:36] <andrei11dr> Silver is way to lame to be Trunks
[1:04:45] <Alexm305> sonic had a rival called Johnny LUL
[1:04:47] <+paladinstarbuster> Does Woolie know bout eggman N-word
[1:04:48] <+TopTieramisu> @DisasterJensen fangame made in the doom engine
[1:04:58] <%Superbro64> I'm going to say no
[1:04:59] <+DisasterJensen> cool
[1:05:00] <0rond> but eggman nega is actually a solid design though
[1:05:02] <zafooru> o no
[1:05:06] <Alexm305> that's my nega doe
[1:05:10] <Superdandy96> Wasn‚Äôt Eggman Nega actually Eggman‚Äôs descendent?
[1:05:13] <+ggbhtg> Sonic 06 couldn't even ruin Blaze
[1:05:14] <%Superbro64> he would of cracked a whole lot of jokes about it other wise
[1:05:15] <%FuqBoiSlim> he knows about eggman mega since he played sonic rush right?
[1:05:21] <+stoutfish> eggman says the n-word
[1:05:26] <+ggbhtg> Eggman BLACK
[1:05:28] <%FuqBoiSlim> eggman nega is an alternate universe eggman
[1:05:34] <%FuqBoiSlim> maybe
[1:05:35] <+ggbhtg> 2 BLACK, 2 Strong

[1:07:29] <Superdandy96> DINO BIRB
[1:07:32] <%Superbro64> per chengi, while making a modern sonic character wad, said that its like 300 sprites plus to make a character
[1:07:35] <dabirSA> I have no idea how to deal with pterodactyls
[1:07:36] <0rond> isn't sonic 2 sonic and tails?
[1:07:39] <Alexm305> sticks is woke tho
[1:07:40] <Invertin> the only game with Tails's name in it was Tails Adventure
[1:07:42] <KeiPrime> sonic and tails sounds like a sega pico game
[1:07:43] <%Superbro64> srb2 characters are some work I'll tell you
[1:07:43] <Solidnick18> i think so
[1:07:45] <Invertin> which has nothing to do with Sonic Adventure
[1:07:46] <ZoomBuster> Sonic and Tails was game gear yes
[1:07:47] <%gatorafan> there was a Sonic & Tails
[1:07:58] <Vyneci> Sonic and Tails 1 and 2 are the JPN names of Sonic Triple Trouble and Sonic Chaos
[1:07:59] <ZoomBuster> Sonic & Tails w as infact Sonic Chaos
[1:08:02] <%SomersaultJustice> Sonic & Flying Knuckles
[1:08:07] <zamzoph> I remember that bird noise from some spooky game, but I can't remember what monkaS
[1:08:08] <Vyneci> I think there's one more, don't fully remember though
[1:08:15] <+jiggy_snipe> JP vs NA
[1:08:16] <+ggbhtg> Tails Skyrocket, wat was it called?
[1:08:19] <SableS139a> @Invertin Tails' Skypatrol and Sonic & Tails 1 & 2 (or Sonic Chaos & Sonic Triple Trouble elsewhere).
[1:08:20] <rockmansrb2> you're going backwards
[1:08:23] <somariman> Sonic and Tails was called Sonic Chaos in the U.S. I think
[1:08:28] <ZoomBuster> ^
[1:08:38] <+ggbhtg> Skypatrol, yeah
[1:08:38] <Invertin> I didn't know about the alt names for sonic chaos and triple trouble I'll take the L on that one
[1:08:39] <InvaderKAZ> Is this an official game? I've never seen it before
[1:08:42] <SableS139a> @ggbhtg Tails' Skypatrol. A Japan-exclusive Game Gear release.
[1:08:47] <%FuqBoiSlim> pretty looking skybox
[1:08:47] <%Superbro64> woolie and his dumb weeb "I only refer to the jp name of games" LUL
[1:08:52] <+stoutfish> the us audience doesn't think tails is cool enough, throw "chaos" into the title
[1:08:54] <%SirGO0SE> SourPls
[1:08:54] <+jiggy_snipe> it's a fan game called Sonic Robo Blast 2
[1:08:55] <zafooru> WOWWW
[1:08:56] <andrei11dr> This is fan made
[1:08:57] <Solidnick18> OH
[1:09:01] <Solidnick18> anti air
[1:09:07] <%gatorafan> ANTI AIR
[1:09:07] <Invertin> this is fanmade and IN THE DOOM ENGINE BTW
[1:09:09] <InvaderKAZ> Ah neat
[1:09:10] <%FuqBoiSlim> The anti air NotLikeThis
[1:09:11] <%SomersaultJustice> skies are secure
[1:09:12] <ZoomBuster> Got Anti Aired
[1:09:19] <%FuqBoiSlim> 2H
[1:09:19] <+ggbhtg> just watch SomeCallMeJohnny for all the answers, Reggie @woolieversus
[1:09:22] <%Superbro64> that character has better anti air fundamentals than you chat Kappa
[1:09:28] <Invertin> every time i remember sonic robo blast 2 is made IN THE DOOM ENGINE i lose my shit all over again this looks better than the quake engine in some places
[1:09:36] <zafooru> Wind!
[1:09:38] <+TopTieramisu> atpWind
[1:09:39] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Invertin
[1:09:43] <ZoomBuster> Oh!
[1:09:44] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> @Invertin so is there no category because it's a fan game?
[1:09:44] <draykon> It is a heavily modified doom engine
[1:09:47] <ZoomBuster> The wind box is reusable?
[1:09:52] <Invertin> they made SLOPES in the DOOM ENGINE
[1:09:59] <draykon> To add stuff like floors over floors, slopes and movable sectors
[1:10:00] <%Superbro64> gold monitors are yes
[1:10:01] <Alexm305> true my aa's need work LUL
[1:10:07] <SableS139a> @ZoomBuster Yep. 2.2 added Golden Monitors that always respawn.
[1:10:09] <+ggbhtg> DOOM SLOPES
[1:10:13] <Solidnick18> yeah lava
[1:10:15] <Siregulus> wind shield segment
[1:10:17] <Invertin> I thought twitch did have a srb2 category but I guess not
[1:10:17] <ZoomBuster> Neat!
[1:10:28] <+TopTieramisu> safely into the bosom of lava
[1:10:38] <+ggbhtg> @invertin I seent it
[1:10:47] <%FuqBoiSlim> if you were sonic solo you'd need the wind shield for this
[1:10:51] <Vyneci> And Sonic Triple Trouble is called Sonic and Tails 2
[1:10:55] <fatguysandwich> Didn't Tails have a his own game?
[1:11:01] <%FuqBoiSlim> he had 2
[1:11:02] <dabirSA> tails had two
[1:11:04] <+Zeromaru2> he did
[1:11:04] <SableS139a> @WoolieVersus Tails has had his name on the box for 2 games outside of Japan: Tails' Adventure & Tails and the Music Maker.
[1:11:07] <%Superbro64> I will say, this is a chill ass stream with some chill as chat. You all are the realest doodGood
[1:11:08] <dabirSA> tails adventure and tails skypatrol
[1:11:08] <am_omega> Yeah Tails had two games.
[1:11:10] <Alexm305> tails adventure?
[1:11:10] <zafooru> Tails is 40 years old
[1:11:19] <0rond> hey man
[1:11:20] <HolisticField> tails has two guns
[1:11:22] <0rond> tails doll was strong
[1:11:22] <andrei11dr> Tails gets it worse than Luigi LUL
[1:11:23] <+ggbhtg> what about Sonic BLAST
[1:11:26] <DaKnightWarrior> lytJEEZ
[1:11:27] <+stoutfish> Tails gets trolled
[1:11:29] <Invertin> speaking of stuff being old: srb2 has been in development for 20 years
[1:11:34] <%Superbro64> dank sonic lore is THE BEST
[1:11:34] <zafooru> YES
[1:11:35] <powerprotoman> Yes
[1:11:35] <Vyneci> YES
[1:11:37] <Solidnick18> YES
[1:11:37] <Louie_Salmon> YES
[1:11:37] <%gatorafan> Reggie is gonna LEARN
[1:11:38] <%SomersaultJustice> is that comic still going? that tails comic was going places
[1:11:38] <Alexm305> tails BibleThump
[1:11:38] <cj_art> oh my god he doesnt know about tails gets trolled
[1:11:41] <0rond> you can NOT ignore the eldtrich horror that is tails doll
[1:11:42] <draykon> I played the hell out of this game when I was 12
[1:11:43] <%FuqBoiSlim> I find that sonic can make people either super aggro or super chill with no in between
[1:11:43] <am_omega> Tails gets trolled is fucking insane.
[1:11:48] <%LoganWulfric> But pat said you aren't in the memesphere woolie
[1:11:48] <Solidnick18> Step up your sonic memes reggie
[1:11:49] <draykon> and they've just kept improving it
[1:11:55] <SableS139a> Every other game starring Tails first and foremost has been exclusive to Japan, including a number of mobile games that were all over the place during the 2000s.
[1:11:59] <zamzoph> Woolie trying to school Reggie on memes is funny considering the recent podcast FeelsGoodMan
[1:12:06] <+ggbhtg> HE DOESN'T KNOW LUL
[1:12:15] <Alexm305> @fuqboislim it's why I don't say u like sonic anymore

[1:13:45] <am_omega> You don't talk about that fucking bench I swear to god.
[1:13:46] <%Parapattern> "Tails, wake up! You fucked up big time." "Knuckles."

[1:16:18] <draykon> Just realized he's playing with a controller
[1:16:23] <dabirSA> the tails reaction face they're talking about is a wonkily-drawn tails going "bwuh?" someone posting the bench just means they're trying to remind you sonic-themed scat baby porn exists

[1:17:03] <somariman> Yeah, controller looks tough for this.
[1:17:23] <%FuqBoiSlim> stop bringing that up I'm halfway through hollowing out rn
[1:17:25] <dabirSA> controller's fine for this, woolie's just kinda using the worst control style cause he got used to it
[1:17:30] <%Superbro64> does anyone still use ds4 or input mapper?
[1:17:33] <0rond> @WoolieVersus all the sonic adventure LP intros were based on tails gets trolled panels

[1:18:25] <JetpackMcQuack> Go patrol the sky
[1:18:36] <SubjectX07x> Dumb ass will learn is pretty strong.
[1:18:39] <fIashman92> It's a Metroidvania
[1:18:43] <%Superbro64> How much DOES woolie know about sonic?
[1:18:50] <@Menitta> Whens Tails Mansion
[1:18:51] <%gatorafan> or Shadow
[1:18:54] <JetpackMcQuack> Even luigi has a series
[1:18:54] <draykon> We're about at the point where the game starts just trying to kill you
[1:18:54] <+TopTieramisu> tails existed solely to appease the younger sibling
[1:18:59] <dabirSA> I'm so mad. im gonna have sex with my girl friend so i wont be so mad
[1:18:59] <@Menitta> Tails is cool and it makes me sad
[1:19:03] <0rond> tails marathon starts now
[1:19:05] <andrei11dr> Don't worry everyone, im sure Tails will make it into Smash...
[1:19:08] <0rond> tails marathon is now finished
[1:19:09] <Superdandy96> Think of it like this Reggie, Tails in Japan: hey it‚Äôs Tails! Tails in America: Where‚Äôs Knuckles?
[1:19:11] <Alexm305> @toptieramisu it worked LUL
[1:19:27] <anarchistPastry> oho?
[1:19:31] <+TopTieramisu> @Alexm305 yes, now he, along with luigi serves as the avatar for all the younger siblings of the world
[1:19:41] <%Superbro64> I 'm not a fan of tails, but really, charmy bee is the only character I will call cancer
[1:19:42] <+Psycosis> SSS
[1:19:46] <%Superbro64> screw that voice
[1:19:54] <%gatorafan> SEGA refuses to let Tails be cool
[1:19:55] <%FuqBoiSlim> Tails' hyper form in sonic 3 is the coolest shit and it's a shame the super emeralds will never make a comeback
[1:20:01] <thewoolieholeofdavidcage> chip is caner
[1:20:02] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:20:06] <Alexm305> @dabirsa it's a shame tgt is quotable as duck but its tos as fuck too
[1:20:13] <%Superbro64> I dont think charmy bee fans exist, straight up
[1:20:17] <fatguysandwich> Charmy Bee in Shadow the Hedgehog was the worst thing
[1:20:18] <Alexm305> fuck* LUL
[1:20:29] <andrei11dr> I like Tails but just not wen he speaks
[1:20:34] <SubjectX07x> Lol I just realized when Tails speeds away as Shadow says "Dumbass will learn" he's basically doing the virgin walk.
[1:20:34] <+Dumb_Parrot> What's the name of this game, please?
[1:20:35] <+Psycosis> and it sucked
[1:20:36] <0rond> please look forward to charmy's adventure
[1:20:39] <+stoutfish> remember that bee that died in the comics from drug overdose?
[1:20:45] <Funky_Honkey> @Dumb_Parrot STFU

[1:20:47] <dabirSA> LSD overdose
[1:20:48] <DaKnightWarrior> lytUSEGUN
[1:20:49] <TomFrank> tails got his own comic
[1:20:51] <%gatorafan> Shadow got songs by Crush 40
[1:20:52] <KeiPrime> drug laced chili dogs
[1:20:56] <%Superbro64> how the actual heck did sonic team think that releasing a game where cartoon characters curse would be a good idea
[1:20:58] <%FuqBoiSlim> @dumb_parrot Sonic robo Blast 2
[1:20:58] <fatguysandwich> Charmy Bee's Adventure exclusive to the Goodle Stadia
[1:20:59] <dabirSA> very specifically LSD
[1:21:01] <+NekoNinja13> I'm gonna say it now, I would play the shit out of a good knuckles treasure finding game
[1:21:02] <%Superbro64> it boggles the mind to this day
[1:21:02] <draykon> Tails has no respect for the level desingers

[1:21:55] <Solidnick18> it's high
[1:21:57] <Alexm305> I liked all the alt gameplay modes in adventure 1 and 2
[1:21:57] <%Blazymaniac> this game seems awesome. is this a fanmake like the kart racer is?
[1:22:05] <Alexm305> even Amy
[1:22:14] <%gatorafan> What's your bird S-link?
[1:22:16] <%JJCheeker> What system was this on?
[1:22:20] <draykon> The kart racer is a mod of this one Blazy
[1:22:23] <%Superbro64> fun fact, during the last sonic twitter ask sonic event, shadow's official va referenced the "damn chaos emerald" meme
[1:22:25] <zamzoph> Isn't that the noise from the pixel platformer Eversion?
[1:22:28] <jazzygrooves__> fanmade, yeah @Blazymaniac
[1:22:28] <%Superbro64> theres a clip on youtube
[1:22:32] <redrins> even the cloaca?
[1:22:36] <+TopTieramisu> IT'S BAD LUCK TO KILL GULLS
[1:22:37] <andrei11dr> PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[1:22:39] <rockmansrb2> Jump and Spin to use it's power
[1:22:39] <faldin> why not some rooster teeth
[1:22:44] <%JJCheeker> This actually looks pretty cool
[1:22:49] <Solidnick18> he's a fan of feet
[1:22:54] <%SirGO0SE> just feet :)
[1:22:54] <fIashman92> There's a separate button to use the shield button
[1:22:54] <Superdandy96> Put that shit in soup at least
[1:22:57] <HairballCT> just use the rooster feet to make stock 4Head
[1:22:58] <+Remery_> but feet tho
[1:23:03] <%gatorafan> I don't like RWBY either Reggie
[1:23:19] <%SirGO0SE> delicious feet
[1:23:24] <Solidnick18> that's true
[1:23:29] <Pyrenity> BibleThump
[1:23:30] <+TopTieramisu> i doubt shark fin soup is eve good
[1:23:34] <+TopTieramisu> even*
[1:23:35] <Solidnick18> the fin?
[1:23:41] <+BionoidLCR> show me that fin girl
[1:23:43] <%Superbro64> My sister once ate a mcdonalds nugget, it went crunch (she ate a chicken beak apparently) and never touched a nugget again
[1:23:45] <%FuqBoiSlim> yall ever had chitlins?
[1:23:49] <%Ivyna_J_Spyder> Shark fin soup is for rich people to show off
[1:23:57] <resloxxx> Sharks are endangered cuz of fin soup
[1:23:58] <+BionoidLCR> @Superbro64 thats stupid
[1:23:59] <Pyrenity> @TopTieramisu I've had it, it's not anything special in my opinion...
[1:23:59] <fIashman92> It's not tasty at all. It's for status and "medicine"
[1:24:05] <Superdandy96> Because traditions
[1:24:06] <Solidnick18> huh
[1:24:07] <%Superbro64> @BionoidLCR I agree

[1:24:36] <Alexm305> BibleThump
[1:24:50] <+TopTieramisu> louis said he didn't try the duck vagina because he'd hate to find out he's addicted to duck vagina
[1:24:52] <rosemon5001> shark is mostly hard hard muscle meat
[1:24:54] <%FuqBoiSlim> it 1 hour and 24 minutes for the stream to devolve into animal genitalia. good worm team
[1:24:57] <+TopTieramisu> the bit was very good
[1:24:57] <+ShogunNoonto> what the fuck did i walk into
[1:25:00] <KeiPrime> some ol rocky mountain oyster

[1:25:23] <BlackMage66652> What does duck puss even taste like?
[1:25:24] <%JJCheeker> i mean people eat goat testicles
[1:25:26] <Alexm305> this is why I don't talk sonic too much LUL
[1:25:26] <Solidnick18> some kid i knew at school ate deer heart
[1:25:34] <+Remery_> do you fry the vagina?
[1:25:37] <%Superbro64> If I remember correctly, this is a one act zone, much like pre 2.2
[1:25:50] <+TopTieramisu> this is a massive level
[1:25:56] <%Superbro64> this goes straight into the final section of levels from here
[1:25:57] <%JJCheeker> Fry them up and make them crispy
[1:26:04] <%FuqBoiSlim> okay so apparently cow heart just tastes like regular steak. can any1 verify this?
[1:26:07] <Solidnick18> everything just bad
[1:26:26] <draykon> He's so close to the end of the level too
[1:26:30] <%bread_assassin> Can't he go the other way?
[1:26:33] <+Jaysky> Am cow heart I taste like steaj
[1:26:38] <%Superbro64> nothing makes me chuckle more then midi horn
[1:26:39] <+Jaysky> *steak
[1:26:42] <+LTKonnor> We have achieved maximum fuckery
[1:26:43] <andrei11dr> Some people do eat Lions and apparently it tastes like better beef
[1:26:48] <%Superbro64> midi horn can sound so pathetic some times LUL
[1:26:49] <@Menitta> Watching this game is anxiety
[1:26:51] <%JJCheeker> People eat cow intestines

[1:27:47] <Solidnick18> Try it
[1:27:49] <%JJCheeker> Get outta here mooobot you crazy
[1:27:55] <%Superbro64> this segment
[1:27:59] <andrei11dr> I bet there's a part of the Sonic fandom that wants to eat Sonic
[1:28:06] <+TopTieramisu> ok this is cool
[1:28:12] <%gatorafan> yeah there is
[1:28:15] <+TopTieramisu> uhhhhhhh
[1:28:16] <draykon> Decades of RND went into make the doom engine do that
[1:28:17] <%SilvaChariot0133> LUL
[1:28:17] <+Remery_> oh thre's sonic vore shit
[1:28:17] <Solidnick18> HUH
[1:28:19] <Solidnick18> Uuuuuuh
[1:28:20] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[1:28:20] <Solidnick18> Oh
[1:28:23] <%FuqBoiSlim> uhhhhhh
[1:28:23] <+LTKonnor> SPEEDRUN TECH
[1:28:24] <dabirSA> damage checking is really fucking wonky on the moving lava
[1:28:24] <neVan0> LUL
[1:28:25] <Alexm305> tame if it's just eat from what I seen
[1:28:26] <Solidnick18> That was wonky
[1:28:28] <ohnoitspooba> So much for that
[1:28:30] <mk_majro> Damaging slopes are...slighty broken
[1:28:32] <Siregulus> sloped lava is buggy @WoolieVersus
[1:28:34] <rockmansrb2> Oh that's embarrassing.
[1:28:35] <fIashman92> The Doom engine wasn't meant to do stuff like this
[1:28:40] <Nested_Dreams> Sloped lava is not real, ride the wave
[1:28:41] <draykon> Incidentally, the fact that the doom engine really doesn't want to do that makes it kinda glitchy
[1:28:43] <dabirSA> I think what happens is it moves away from you before it checks whether you should be hurt
[1:28:49] <0rond> it will burn you
[1:28:50] <%Superbro64> feel free to show me first woolie :)
[1:28:51] <KeiPrime> uh
[1:28:54] <%SilvaChariot0133> convection?
[1:28:55] <+TopTieramisu> your skin will sizzle
[1:28:55] <JetpackMcQuack> its hot though
[1:28:59] <KeiPrime> it'll burn you before you get close enough
[1:28:59] <andrei11dr> I didn't mean vore ,i meant like...a Sonic dish LUL
[1:29:02] <%FuqBoiSlim> I can air step like my favourite bleach characters?! Pog5
[1:29:03] <Solidnick18> hahaha
[1:29:06] <%FuqBoiSlim> PogChamp
[1:29:11] <JetpackMcQuack> Lava OP
[1:29:12] <+casualelite> tell that to Kars
[1:29:13] <Okcfooser> will you demonstrate for us
[1:29:14] <redrins> an actual stream of lava will burn you real good
[1:29:17] <+TopTieramisu> your shoes will melt
[1:29:22] <+paladinstarbuster> you explode when you fall in lava not sink
[1:29:23] <0rond> it will literally heat you up before you touch it
[1:29:28] <+TopTieramisu> kars actually solved the heat
[1:29:33] <+waltzqueen> Isn't Convection, heat in the air around laa, also a thing that happens?
[1:29:34] <+Brentsei> big hot for rock mean big hot for you
[1:29:38] <%Ivyna_J_Spyder> Lava is too dense for people to sink in. You just stay on top and burn horribly
[1:29:44] <%FuqBoiSlim> your clothes and skin would combust before you even touch it tho huh?
[1:29:46] <%Superbro64> theres a medal behind the ship @WoolieVersus
[1:29:49] <+mazingmax> It's related to density/ viscosity-- chemist
[1:30:01] <halfsprink> The hell, what game is this?
[1:30:04] <0rond> that's a non euclidian fluid
[1:30:06] <draykon> Special stage token in this room
[1:30:09] <+TopTieramisu> omg it's finally over
[1:30:13] <+NekoNinja13> its actually just corn starch and water. gery easy to make
[1:30:14] <%Superbro64> oh well
[1:30:14] <Explodincatz> to the MOOOON
[1:30:15] <Solidnick18> space PogChamp
[1:30:18] <presque> "a couple other things" is water

[1:30:37] <Skeletonmanners> no boss in the previous level?
[1:30:37] <Cacherow> Pepepls
[1:30:39] <%Superbro64> woolie has no continues, correct?
[1:30:39] <%SirGO0SE> SourPls
[1:30:47] <0rond> you can walk on non euclidian fluids if you step on them hard enough, but if you stand still you will sink though them
[1:30:48] <mk_majro> egg rock hasn't even existed for 20 years
[1:30:51] <+TopTieramisu> can't believe this game dev is a globehead
[1:30:52] <+mazingmax> non newtonian fluids have special viscosity properties but being able to walk on lava is not due to non newtonian viscosity properties
[1:30:52] <dabirSA> red volcano isn't done
[1:30:52] <0rond> custard for example
[1:31:00] <draykon> Red Volcano is unfinished Skeleton. It's only one act
[1:31:01] <dabirSA> there's going to be an act 2 in future versions
[1:31:10] <%SirGO0SE> SourPls oh shit SourPls
[1:31:13] <draykon> There's also a couple more stages on the roadmap that haven't even really been started
[1:31:13] <+Jaysky> Chat how fucked is Woolie?
[1:31:15] <andrei11dr> Woolies mom has an od science + religion combo
[1:31:16] <%Superbro64> @dabirSA they plan to expand the main campaign ?
[1:31:16] <0rond> yeah lava is just really thick
[1:31:19] <Alexm305> I'll be honest when I played this game the most techno hill was the final zone
[1:31:20] <%JJCheeker> Music is good
[1:31:22] <%Superbro64> citation needed, reggie
[1:31:33] <jazzygrooves__> @Jaysky yes.
[1:31:38] <+Akizea> honestly about to start listening to this soundtrack
[1:31:40] <draykon> There are plans for an airship and city level
[1:31:43] <+TopTieramisu> so good robotnik is sonic's Q?
[1:31:45] <a_mad_dragon> but you NEED friction to accelerate
[1:31:46] <+Jaysky> NotLikeThis
[1:31:50] <+Akizea> sonic robot blast 2 right?
[1:31:53] <%Superbro64> thats some cool beans there
[1:31:57] <+Akizea> robo*
[1:31:57] <+theAncopro> or his uncle chuck made them for him
[1:32:02] <%Superbro64> @Akizea yes
[1:32:02] <+TopTieramisu> this segment is great
[1:32:03] <+nekodelic> wouldn't you want more friction?
[1:32:08] <+theAncopro> or he was born with them
[1:32:09] <SuperKirby24> Lookatdat blast processing LUL
[1:32:17] <%FuqBoiSlim> LETS GOOOO
[1:32:23] <draykon> Woolie doing this legit, I always just take one hit and iframe through the whole thing
[1:32:24] <TomFrank> has there been a casino night zone yet?
[1:32:29] <dabirSA> there's an option to flip the camera when gravity inverts
[1:32:35] <%Superbro64> this segment is screwy with how friction works
[1:32:44] <dabirSA> if you don't want to deal with this horrible gravity shit, that option makes things a lot more tolerable
[1:32:45] <VCryas> What sonic game is this
[1:32:49] <absolute_cagemony> wtf was that Judgement Cut End?
[1:32:52] <+TopTieramisu> it's a fangame

[1:33:45] <Solidnick18> he's freaking out
[1:33:46] <Solidnick18> LUL
[1:33:50] <draykon> This room's gimmick has some fun interactions
[1:33:51] <%Superbro64> woolie, no WutFace
[1:34:08] <dabirSA> is that the dwarf fortress kind of fun
[1:34:08] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:34:10] <CaptainTitforce> BibleThump
[1:34:11] <+Zeromaru2> Tails is freaking OUT! bitterShook
[1:34:13] <%Superbro64> does rings hold ANY value in this game, other than needed 1 for an extra hit?
[1:34:14] <dabirSA> where it makes you lose arbitrarily
[1:34:15] <andrei11dr> Why does this better level design than anything made by Team Sonic ? LUL
[1:34:15] <%SirGO0SE> SourPls woolieREGGIEFUL_SG SourPls
[1:34:17] <absolute_cagemony> why is SOnic in a cluster of fish eggs?
[1:34:20] <dabirSA> get 100 for extra lifef
[1:34:22] <%Superbro64> and the extra life thing
[1:34:25] <%FuqBoiSlim> Tails exists in multiple realities simultaneously
[1:34:42] <%gatorafan> Tails will never reach the truth
[1:34:42] <+theAncopro> he stops breathing if he does
[1:34:44] <+paladinstarbuster> "He can do anything as long as he uses his mind"
[1:34:47] <redrins> and then he kills himself
[1:34:49] <KeiPrime> he taps his foot
[1:34:52] <KeiPrime> then just fucks off
[1:34:53] <%FuqBoiSlim> which is why he never dies. because 'he' never got hit
[1:34:55] <andrei11dr> Tails is the Griffith oh Sonic
[1:34:57] <dabirSA> if you have all the emeralds you can use rings to turn into super sonic
[1:34:58] <+TopTieramisu> this is a game of passion. i have a feeling team sonic is actually just a game making algorithm that's bugged
[1:35:03] <+Jaysky> How else could he obtain two tails @fuqboislim
[1:35:07] <fruit_pie_the_magician> You're slooooowww
[1:35:18] <%Superbro64> according to the storybook duology of games, sonic canonically house a house
[1:35:25] <%Superbro64> so he can sit on a couch I suppose
[1:35:33] <%Superbro64> *has a house
[1:36:05] <draykon> issue is you can't pull the camera through walls in the doom engine
[1:36:09] <+TopTieramisu> now, does this game have a super sonic boss fight?
[1:36:13] <draykon> Or you get this crazy hall of mirrors effect
[1:36:16] <+NekoNinja13> sonic is actually notorious for being layabout whenever something isnt happening. he loves to chill actually
[1:36:18] <%SilvaChariot0133> Jebaited
[1:36:19] <+TopTieramisu> Jebaited
[1:36:20] <Vyneci> HOLY SHIT

[1:36:49] <+Jaysky> I still find it strange how the Sonic series didn't die after so many bad games, yet its fanbase is still scary big
[1:36:50] <+paladinstarbuster> SBT
[1:36:51] <%gatorafan> that's why you get the shoes I guess
[1:36:52] <fIashman92> Get the speed shoes

[1:37:20] <dabirSA> he played as knuckles before so he never saw this part
[1:37:22] <Passion9XOtaku> This fan made?, I love those sprite blobs
[1:37:36] <rockmansrb2> You could take the Tails path.
[1:37:40] <+paladinstarbuster> JUST THOK
[1:37:42] <%Superbro64> sega could make BANK if they actually make good games for once, as mania has shown
[1:37:43] <turbofolk> Woolie please
[1:37:44] <%gatorafan> SPEEEEED
[1:37:57] <fatguysandwich> I am speed
[1:37:59] <+paladinstarbuster> POGGERS
[1:37:59] <%SilvaChariot0133> lytFIRSTTRY
[1:38:00] <%FuqBoiSlim> LETS GOOOOOO
[1:38:15] <Siregulus> snailers do not care about your well being
[1:38:29] <draykon> Time for more Weird Gravity Shit
[1:38:38] <dabirSA> snails are the worst shit
[1:38:43] <dabirSA> the gravity is the worst shit
[1:38:45] <%Superbro64> last one doodWAT
[1:38:46] <%FuqBoiSlim> this is his last continue too... monkaS
[1:38:47] <dabirSA> this whole level fucking sucks
[1:38:47] <%gatorafan> LAST CONTINUE
[1:38:49] <fIashman92> Did he go straight to Sonic or did he play Tails/Knuckles before this?
[1:38:52] <draykon> Not really a fan of this one to be honest
[1:38:56] <DaKnightWarrior> lytONEMORE
[1:38:57] <draykon> it's just gimmick room after gimmick room
[1:38:57] <dabirSA> he played knuckles first
[1:38:59] <andrei11dr> GAME OVER YEEEEAAAA!
[1:39:01] <starwars90001> This feels like an official game,
[1:39:05] <%FuqBoiSlim> @fiashman92 he played knuckles beforehand
[1:39:06] <Siregulus> this level definitely shows its age
[1:39:21] <%Superbro64> @Siregulus eyy, good day Sire!
[1:39:22] <fIashman92> Good to hear. Sonic is super hard to play in this game
[1:39:25] <draykon> It's the only one they didn't rework for 2.2, so there's no slopes either
[1:39:25] <%Superbro64> hows it going
[1:39:29] <Passion9XOtaku> Seriously digging the visual style, but judging jumps mst be a bitch
[1:39:30] <yet_another_brony> woolie have you noticed each continue you use starts you off with more lives
[1:39:32] <%gatorafan> I don't think this level is that old
[1:39:36] <+TopTieramisu> 12 god damn lives
[1:39:41] <Siregulus> (it's pretty damn old)
[1:39:48] <draykon> This is from 2.0 I think? A few years back
[1:39:56] <mk_majro> 2.0 came out 10 years ago
[1:40:02] <draykon> fuck I'm old
[1:40:04] <%gatorafan> oh no
[1:40:09] <%gatorafan> ITS SETTING JN
[1:40:11] <%Superbro64> how long was 2.2 in development for?
[1:40:14] <%FuqBoiSlim> when did this game come out?
[1:40:16] <CaptainTitforce> oh boy
[1:40:17] <Siregulus> THE SPINCUSHION
[1:40:21] <Siregulus> he gave up.
[1:40:37] <CaptainTitforce> rememember playing this as a big babby
[1:40:59] <@Menitta> Casino levels in Sonic are all hits
[1:41:01] <yet_another_brony> this game came out 21 years ago
[1:41:02] <%Superbro64> eh, I can live without spinball
[1:41:05] <+DreyfussFrost> Spring Yard Zone originally, right?
[1:41:05] <@Menitta> They're all fucking great
[1:41:07] <CaptainTitforce> oops remember*
[1:41:15] <%SirGO0SE> i loved that game and cant believe people look back at it poorly..
[1:41:15] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1234692167358177282?s=19
[1:41:16] <dabirSA> @Menitta let's not say things we can't take back about bingo highway
[1:41:18] <majima666> i like spinball lol
[1:41:24] <+DreyfussFrost> Sonic 1 had the bumpers.
[1:41:26] <%FuqBoiSlim> This game is older than me NotLikeThis
[1:41:33] <@Menitta> Bingo Highway is less good but still cool
[1:41:41] <andrei11dr> Its not as good as that metroid one
[1:41:41] <rockmansrb2> Take the Tails route.
[1:41:42] <%Superbro64> I will say, screw the spingball segments in heroes though
[1:41:42] <+squishy1002> spinball was the shit
[1:41:43] <dabirSA> bingo highway sucks so hard
[1:41:55] <Passion9XOtaku> This is what the first 3D Sonic game should have been
[1:41:57] <draykon> Hot tip: This room has a tails route
[1:41:58] <GarbageNirvana> Back to roboblasting again I see
[1:42:10] <%Superbro64> mouse and keyboard segment right here
[1:42:16] <@Menitta> Apparently the first version of this came out before Adventure
[1:42:21] <+TaphexWin> Does this game use a 2D to 3 D engine like DooM?
[1:42:22] <KnivesEve> oh hey we playing some sanic today?
[1:42:22] <%Superbro64> @dabirSA is there worse levels in heroes
[1:42:32] <draykon> It's a heavily modded Doom engine Taphex
[1:42:33] <GarbageNirvana> Yeah this has been in the oven for a minute
[1:42:37] <mk_majro> You don't really need the speed shoes but
[1:42:39] <Siregulus> this is one of those cases where the Simple playstyle's camera rotation helps out a bit
[1:42:42] <concretenj> the shoes might be making this harder
[1:42:45] <Siregulus> since it's rotating as you're strafing
[1:42:51] <+lilgarbage_> No fear. Only SPEED
[1:42:53] <+TaphexWin> Oh that's super neat.
[1:42:54] <%Superbro64> yeye, Fickle does great work
[1:42:58] <draykon> Egg Rock in general is pretty unfriendly to different control styles
[1:43:01] <%Superbro64> shoutouts to her for the simple controols
[1:43:02] <+tuchpi> LUL forsenD
[1:43:20] <draykon> I'm just waiting for him to notice the Tails Route
[1:43:27] <%gatorafan> running out of lives
[1:43:38] <%Superbro64> what happens when you game over with no continues?
[1:43:39] <GarbageNirvana> just be perfect 4head
[1:43:41] <13ig_Kain> what Sonic is this?
[1:43:45] <Siregulus> start over at the zone's first act
[1:43:54] <%Superbro64> not too bad
[1:43:56] <Csagets> @WoolieVersus You can change the way the camera behaves in the player control options that might help with controllers.
[1:44:01] <andrei11dr> He keeps hitting the wall instead of making a right there
[1:44:08] <CaptainTitforce> @13ig_kain sonic robo blast 2
[1:44:10] <KnivesEve> never seen this sonic before, which is this?
[1:44:12] <yet_another_brony> go reggie
[1:44:17] <fIashman92> That's the tails Path
[1:44:21] <%gatorafan> SAVED
[1:44:22] <CaptainTitforce> a fan game
[1:44:24] <draykon> There it is lol
[1:44:27] <Siregulus> this is the tails path, knuckles cant actually jump up here
[1:44:29] <%gatorafan> woolieREGGIEFUL woolieREGGIEFUL woolieREGGIEFUL woolieREGGIEFUL
[1:44:29] <%bread_assassin> Reggie saved the day.
[1:44:45] <GarbageNirvana> Here's your easy baby route for babies
[1:44:48] <%FuqBoiSlim> let's goooo reggie woolieREGGIEFUL woolieREGGIEFUL woolieREGGIEFUL woolieREGGIEFUL
[1:44:53] <draykon> There's a lot of alternate character routes in general yeah
[1:44:56] <CaptainTitforce> babby route
[1:45:24] <%FuqBoiSlim> you already used up 9 of your 12 lives on this section theres no shame here
[1:45:35] <%FuqBoiSlim> 10 now nvm
[1:45:39] <%Superbro64> good stuff
[1:45:42] <%gatorafan> Woolie refuses to be saved
[1:45:52] <%Javaa01> WoolieVS Doom wall collisions
[1:45:54] <draykon> Yoooo
[1:45:58] <presque> They really nailed the "controls like ass" aspect of Sonic
[1:46:00] <yet_another_brony> short hops
[1:46:01] <JetpackMcQuack> Gravity level NotLikeThis
[1:46:02] <%Superbro64> bye
[1:46:09] <andrei11dr> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[1:46:13] <dabirSA> it controls really well in either of the other two control styles
[1:46:13] <%FuqBoiSlim> good god
[1:46:14] <%Superbro64> you have to thok between platforms I think
[1:46:15] <draykon> presque, it handles a lot better if you use WASD+Mouse
[1:46:23] <dabirSA> it defaults to the worst one and woolie got used to it
[1:46:39] <%Superbro64> you havent seen woolie's first person shooter setup I see @draykon
[1:46:42] <Siregulus> you can reach each platforms with full jumps
[1:46:45] <Solidnick18> OH
[1:47:08] <TigerClaws12> probably because the default one is meant for mouse users
[1:47:22] <%Javaa01> Doom is meant for mouse users
[1:47:24] <andrei11dr> I sense big FAILURE
[1:47:26] <%Javaa01> In general
[1:47:30] <dabirSA> no, the KB+M one isn't what woolie's using
[1:47:48] <+kyh9> How can Tails fly if there's no air?
[1:47:48] <dabirSA> he's using the original "controller-friendly" one where you still have to manually control the camera
[1:47:48] <TigerClaws12> oh, rip
[1:47:55] <%Superbro64> woolie is hard mode-ing, no kbm, no simple controls
[1:47:59] <%FuqBoiSlim> woolie is playing with a dualshock 4 I believe
[1:48:01] <+kyh9> How is Tails able to fly without air?
[1:48:18] <dabirSA> simple control mode would make the camera auto-adjust to follow behind him
[1:48:18] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:48:22] <%FuqBoiSlim> @kyh9 dont worrh about it
[1:48:23] <am_omega> Just movement of his tails.
[1:48:32] <%Superbro64> he's aware of the control setting
[1:48:33] <andrei11dr> Tails is an elder god
[1:48:35] <%gatorafan> Sonic can also breath on Space when he wants to
[1:48:36] <dabirSA> I think someone told him about it in a way that made him think you couldn't manually control the camera
[1:48:50] <%Superbro64> he likes being able to rotate the camera independently
[1:49:06] <%Superbro64> yea, that was me, apologies
[1:49:14] <@Menitta> We at Meteor Herd
[1:49:20] <andrei11dr> Talk shit, get hit LUL
[1:49:27] <%FuqBoiSlim> look guys its moebius Kappa
[1:49:28] <%Superbro64> metor herd song slaps
[1:49:34] <turbofolk> Well i love how even i 2.5 the game still forces sonic to move SLOW AS FUCK

[1:50:26] <@Menitta> dont @ me
[1:50:29] <%FuqBoiSlim> HELP ME GET THE EMERALDS
[1:50:30] <%gatorafan> yeah, music is super cool on this zone
[1:50:33] <%Superbro64> theres at least 2 more levels I think
[1:50:36] <+kyh9> oh god
[1:50:38] <dabirSA> the music owns but the level is dogshit
[1:50:40] <+kyh9> tails clones
[1:50:49] <draykon> There's one more after this, then the final gauntlet
[1:50:51] <Solidnick18> Pumpkin hills is a great song
[1:50:53] <dabirSA> there's egg rock 2, black core 1 and 2 then the shitty final boss
[1:50:54] <+Jaysky> @menitta but u rite tho

[1:56:03] <%FuqBoiSlim> You cannot defeat the cold heartless void of space
[1:56:05] <%Superbro64> doesnt it work like it does in the classic games?
[1:56:09] <heartlesshealer> Invincibility does not recycle oxygen, just keeps it from being damaged
[1:56:12] <powerprotoman> it dont matter if your body is invincable if you cant breath
[1:56:12] <draykon> Invincibility has never protected from instakill hazards
[1:56:13] <yet_another_brony> invincibility never saved you from drowning in any sonic game
[1:56:16] <KarenIsMaiWaifu> lirikEZ2
[1:56:23] <%Superbro64> yeah, that's what I thought
[1:56:25] <openeyeswideawake> you can spell invincibleA without Air
[1:56:26] <Siregulus> this crusher wall sucks
[1:56:28] <Akett> Thok jumps are rad.

[2:01:14] <%FuqBoiSlim> PHEW
[2:01:38] <restingbones> @WoolieVersus Woolie you haven't filled in the category for the game youre playing.
[2:01:46] <ProfessorGascan90> this seems like it demands an awful lot of precision for something kludged together in gzdoom
[2:01:52] <heartlesshealer> good job
[2:01:57] <%SomersaultJustice> THWOMP
[2:02:03] <%FuqBoiSlim> @restingbones it's a fan game. those dont have categories
[2:02:04] <+XenoDandelion> sonique
[2:02:06] <Broand> it actually has a lot of tech in it
[2:02:23] <restingbones> @FuqBoiSlim This is a fan game? It looks super legit!
[2:02:23] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1234692167358177282?s=19
[2:02:27] <am_omega> So for SBRK I hope someone mods in Woolie and the gang as character for the future Race War LUL
[2:02:31] <Siregulus> ACTUALLY amazed that the turret missed
[2:02:35] <+ItsSleepyBoi> which game is this?
[2:02:38] <Siregulus> Sonic Robo Blast 2
[2:02:39] <Solidnick18> LUL
[2:02:40] <heartlesshealer> greed
[2:02:42] <+Ropcord> doom
[2:03:04] <%Superbro64> no loops period, ever I think
[2:03:09] <fIashman92> Give it another 20 years
[2:03:10] <+kyh9> The camera doesn't flip, that's the main thing
[2:03:12] <%Superbro64> actual doom and srb2 heads can correct me
[2:03:14] <Siregulus> loops can work but you have to make them in a hacky way
[2:03:20] <Siregulus> and usually you just wouldn't take them regardless
[2:03:30] <dabirSA> you don't actually change angle on slopes in this game, that's why wall running doesn't work
[2:03:30] <+Bananaking744> isnt this build?
[2:03:43] <dabirSA> this is modified doom
[2:03:48] <%FuqBoiSlim> just skip the whole section LUL
[2:04:00] <+Bananaking744> my god
[2:04:01] <Siregulus> cant skip it cause you didn't activate the elevator LUL
[2:04:12] <Akett> The room needs more POWER.
[2:04:35] <heartlesshealer> big arrow
[2:04:36] <%Superbro64> thank christ for srb2karts minimaps
[2:05:06] <+DexusJik> music is insanely hype
[2:05:17] <+Harshmelo> Is this a fan game?
[2:05:20] <%Superbro64> si
[2:05:21] <Broand> Yes
[2:05:24] <Siregulus> yes, Sonic Robo Blast 2 @Harshmelo
[2:05:26] <am_omega> Nah its official Kappa
[2:05:35] <%Superbro64> "sega hire this man"
[2:05:36] <Akett> In general this game has some great music.
[2:05:47] <Junkles> anyone in chat know if there's plans for more Dokapon or is that a done deal?
[2:05:54] <Siregulus> spincushions thoroughly avoided
[2:06:00] <%FuqBoiSlim> 2 OF EM?! DansGame
[2:06:21] <heartlesshealer> lasers!
[2:06:21] <openeyeswideawake> mokydoW mokydoW mokydoW mokydoW
[2:06:23] <dabirSA> that snailer is the biggest bullshit in the game
[2:06:27] <dabirSA> it breaks the promise
[2:06:35] <gade177> Anything to stop Sonic from going fast.
[2:06:38] <Siregulus> the snailers are the best part
[2:06:39] <dabirSA> if you see a badnik in sonic, the implicit promise is you can kill it
[2:06:44] <dabirSA> you can't kill that snailer
[2:06:46] <openeyeswideawake> fool
[2:06:46] <Solidnick18> LULL
[2:06:47] <terribleusername> LUL
[2:06:48] <dabirSA> the promise is broken
[2:06:50] <%gatorafan> that's a Metropolis Zone mantis shit
[2:06:50] <+jiggy_snipe> I doubt they play Dokapon again. Maybe they do a playthrough if they have nothing long to play (very unlikely)
[2:06:50] <+TruSanKyuu> LUL

[2:10:37] <%Superbro64> to be fair, classic sonic is super mean
[2:10:43] <Solidnick18> that's some 90's shit
[2:10:46] <andrei11dr> Ummmmm
[2:10:52] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's that romhack difficulty
[2:10:55] <%gatorafan> nah, Sonic 3 is comfy
[2:11:09] <CruxAustralis> !game
[2:11:10] <%Superbro64> classic sonic =/= just sonic 3
[2:11:19] <jbrooksdev> wasn't this the one made in the doom engine?
[2:11:23] <Junkles> fool me once, shame on me. fool me twice, we gamin'
[2:11:24] <+jiggy_snipe> yes
[2:11:25] <GunlaEXE> ERZ is a significant step up for a variety of reasons, ultimately
[2:11:27] <JetpackMcQuack> Sonic 2 still kicks my ass
[2:11:29] <@Menitta> Classic Sonic means Sonic 2 and 3. No more, no less.
[2:11:31] <am_omega> I find classic Sonic easy as hell though.
[2:11:38] <%gatorafan> Sonic 1 was also easy til Scrap Brain

[2:12:03] <Akett> That badnick did a Bloodborne parry on you.
[2:12:04] <%Superbro64> be fair, there are...at least 2 people who like sonic 1
[2:12:05] <CruxAustralis> Thank you
[2:12:05] <@Menitta> Sonic CD fans DO stay losing because its Sonic CD
[2:12:14] <andrei11dr> @menitta Wat about Sonic and Knuckles?
[2:12:22] <%Superbro64> @Menitta LUL
[2:12:22] <@Menitta> Included in 3
[2:12:25] <JayPastaForce> Po'ltan d'niaiser
[2:12:31] <am_omega> Sonic 1 has the ideas but a bit rough, Sonic CD is fine.
[2:12:33] <%FuqBoiSlim> Knuckles Chaotix Wins Again Bros!
[2:12:34] <Solidnick18> lol
[2:12:39] <@Menitta> 3 to me means Sonic 3&K
[2:12:49] <+XenoDandelion> I like sonic
[2:12:55] <Solidnick18> reggie is having a good time atleast
[2:13:02] <%Superbro64> if you can beat sonic 3d blast you are a god
[2:13:05] <%gatorafan> I remember when little me freaked out because so had Sonic 3 alone and I SAW THOSE PATHS
[2:13:07] <%Superbro64> that game is impossible for me
[2:13:07] <andrei11dr> Wat about Sonic Mania @menitta
[2:13:08] <@Menitta> Hey I still lose. I like Sonic Adventure and Heroes.
[2:13:14] <%gatorafan> PATHS IS CANT TAKE BECAUSE FUCK ME
[2:13:16] <@Menitta> Mania is NEW Classic

[2:13:41] <%Superbro64> if you had no siblings to play sa2 battle multiplayer, you had half a childhood
[2:13:49] <am_omega> Adventure 1 is fine and Heroes is fun only if you play Sonic and kinda Shadow since his is just a speedrun of Sonic.
[2:13:50] <Solidnick18> Nice
[2:13:51] <+jiggy_snipe> facts
[2:14:22] <%Superbro64> amy constant timestop in sa2 battle was bs though

[2:15:39] <+jiggy_snipe> Sonic Robo Blast 2
[2:16:08] <%Superbro64> sonic if you had no idea what the internet was, is a b+ franchise I feel

[2:18:40] <dabirSA> this is the best metal sonic mashup there's ever been
[2:18:47] <andrei11dr> AHHH SHIET
[2:18:49] <Siregulus> respect the RACE son
[2:18:50] <%Superbro64> this took some time for me personally
[2:18:50] <dabirSA> it mashes up this game, sonic CD and sonic 4 episode 2
[2:18:52] <@Menitta> YOOO METAL SONIC
[2:19:01] <%Superbro64> probably the one stage I had the most trouble with
[2:19:04] <dabirSA> you've already lost
[2:19:12] <Solidnick18> gotta do this the honest way
[2:19:13] <dabirSA> this level has a hard 1m35s time limit
[2:19:17] <heartlesshealer> jump heights!
[2:19:21] <+jiggy_snipe> nice reference track
[2:19:21] <%bread_assassin> Is this a race?
[2:19:22] <+paladinstarbuster> woolie is not ready for this
[2:19:22] <%Superbro64> "omae wa mou shindeiru"
[2:19:25] <Jathspuh> tpYGOpotofgreed
[2:19:33] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @KingZaffy
[2:19:38] <dabirSA> it's not quite a race but you have to be very close behind metal sonic at the slowest
[2:19:49] <%Superbro64> the final segment is bs with the drowning, even if you do everything else clean
[2:19:49] <%FuqBoiSlim> yooooo
[2:19:56] <Solidnick18> He has already won
[2:20:01] <KingZaffy> Oh shit, Stardust Speedway AND Sonic 4's Metal Sonic theme in this
[2:20:10] <%FuqBoiSlim> it uses stardust speedway AND his theme from sonic 4 lets gooo
[2:20:11] <am_omega> Metal Sonic is just siting there like "Did he get lost?"
[2:20:11] <andrei11dr> Yo,this song is fire
[2:20:13] <Siregulus> if you know what you're doing you can speed ahead farther than metal
[2:20:24] <heartlesshealer> Not oxygen, time limits
[2:20:27] <yet_another_brony> thats not space fhats just metal sonic beating you
[2:20:33] <%Superbro64> there is a hard 1:35 time limit with this stage @WoolieVersus
[2:20:36] <%Superbro64> per dabir
[2:20:38] <dabirSA> it is space, metal sonic lets the air out at the end
[2:20:48] <%bread_assassin> So does the death clock start once Metal Sonic finishes the race?
[2:20:52] <%Superbro64> si
[2:20:54] <Siregulus> he's supposed to be cutting off the oxygen behind after the race ends
[2:20:57] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I mean, so does Sonic
[2:21:01] <am_omega> Its s p e e d all over again.
[2:21:02] <heartlesshealer> Yup
[2:21:04] <+paladinstarbuster> quiter talk
[2:21:25] <rockmansrb2> It is a race. You have to beat him.
[2:21:27] <Siregulus> there's a way reggie
[2:21:34] <andrei11dr> Do you get anything for beating him at the race ?
[2:21:43] <powerprotoman> its race
[2:21:48] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Hard time limit on this level apparently
[2:21:53] <+Limited_Sky> which sonic game is this?
[2:21:54] <JetpackMcQuack> 1:35
[2:21:58] <%FuqBoiSlim> woolie you have to speed up
[2:22:00] <%Superbro64> 1:35 limit
[2:22:03] <heartlesshealer> Time limits.
[2:22:03] <dabirSA> 1:35 time limit
[2:22:05] <dickbuttwoman> You need to beat him
[2:22:14] <rockmansrb2> Sonic Robo Blast 2. A fan game.
[2:22:15] <%FuqBoiSlim> @limited_sky Pokemon black and white 2
[2:22:17] <+kyh9> You have 95 seconds:
[2:22:18] <+aishman> Time Limit dude, it's cause Metal Sonic crossed the finish line
[2:22:18] <Solidnick18> that's just bullshit
[2:22:19] <TomFrank> space lava
[2:22:21] <heartlesshealer> YES
[2:22:28] <dabirSA> no you don't woolie
[2:22:29] <+jiggy_snipe> Kappa
[2:22:29] <+Rancaliber_> Looks like a timer kicks up once Metal Sonic finishes.
[2:22:29] <powerprotoman> DO YOU
[2:22:30] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Do you?
[2:22:31] <+kyh9> There is
[2:22:31] <heartlesshealer> Reggie has EYES
[2:22:32] <%Superbro64> @dickbuttwoman eyy, hello
[2:22:33] <restingbones> Lol, Woolie
[2:22:34] <yet_another_brony> YES THERE IS
[2:22:34] <+TheFlamingC> it's not that. Metal Sonic already reached the finish line
[2:22:35] <%bread_assassin> No, Reggie's right.
[2:22:37] <Solidnick18> DO YA?
[2:22:40] <andrei11dr> This seems really hard
[2:22:42] <%gatorafan> Reggie is right
[2:22:42] <+kyh9> 95 seconds
[2:22:48] <%FuqBoiSlim> "I know for a fact" how does he do it
[2:22:49] <DarkVinceX> Reggie figured it out
[2:22:50] <%Superbro64> woolie "reading chat during lp is for cowards" Kappa
[2:22:52] <dickbuttwoman> @Superbro64 Heyo! Always happy to see sanic here.
[2:22:56] <dabirSA> @WoolieVersus Reggie is right, it's a hard 1:35 time limit. The countdown is on Metal Sonic letting the air out of the level when he finishes
[2:22:57] <yet_another_brony> Listen to reggie
[2:22:58] <+jiggy_snipe> well let's see if it happens again lol
[2:23:01] <+jiggy_snipe> 35 secs
[2:23:04] <restingbones> Reggie hulimiate Woolie for thinking he knows things
[2:23:16] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Reggie is super right
[2:23:17] <%Superbro64> @dickbuttwoman keep pushing those comics. Always see you when I lurk on the subreddit, good stuff doodGood
[2:23:30] <Siregulus> i've NEVER seen someone die to that omg
[2:23:31] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:23:56] <presque> The "random space mechanics" is more plausible than a timer I guess

[2:24:50] <%XenoDandelion> XenoDandelion subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:25:09] <%Superbro64> I do wonder if there's overlap with people who dont like sonic, and people who give up when sonic gets hard
[2:25:19] <%Superbro64> like journos and the dmc franchise
[2:25:28] <+kyh9> It's a distance thing
[2:25:50] <%FuqBoiSlim> some people definitely dont like sonic because they have a hard time with the games
[2:26:12] <%XenoDandelion> are the new sonic comics any good
[2:26:17] <%Superbro64> sonic does sometimes not explain the controls well, as that leads to big frustration. See: Riders
[2:26:21] <Siregulus> metal sonic actually IS a ghost, though he takes his time
[2:26:27] <+nekodelic> the violent right is a threat to our democracy

[2:29:55] <%tearknack> lol no
[2:30:07] <jbrooksdev> I would say "Tails finishing the job", but thats a very specific google result i dont want to conjure up
[2:30:09] <%FuqBoiSlim> monkaS
[2:30:10] <dabirSA> you're thinking of the archie comics where sonic's dad was roboticised
[2:30:11] <heartlesshealer> No that's the SatAM cartoon
[2:30:13] <Fujiwara_92> monkaS
[2:30:13] <%tearknack> sonics um, uncle, did get turned into a robot in the archie comics, iirc
[2:30:17] <NeonBleu> I think that was some weird comic stuff
[2:30:18] <Siregulus> METAL ROBOTNIK
[2:30:20] <+theAncopro> YOO

[2:33:15] <openeyeswideawake> How metal would it be do explode into your own face
[2:33:16] <%FuqBoiSlim> there has to be a Doomsday zone type secret boss right??
[2:33:16] <+Shindeil> tppowerGG
[2:33:18] <andrei11dr> wooliePOYO wooliePOYO wooliePOYO wooliePOYO wooliePOYO wooliePOYO
[2:33:19] <%Superbro64> THIS version came out last year
[2:33:21] <dickbuttwoman> 20?
[2:33:22] <yet_another_brony> 21
[2:33:22] <+kyh9> SOULnic
[2:33:24] <%XenoDandelion> now hug
[2:33:25] <Akett> 22 years old.
[2:33:26] <dabirSA> 20 years
[2:33:29] <heartlesshealer> we don't talk about the emeralds on a first run
[2:33:30] <Fujiwara_92> PogChamp
[2:33:31] <Vyneci> It did get updated pretty recently though
[2:33:31] <fIashman92> Predates Sonnic Adventures
[2:33:36] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Oh, fan game. That explains why it actually feels like a sonic game despite being 3d.
[2:33:47] <ThatsCriCri> Yeah something like 20 years
[2:33:55] <openeyeswideawake> Sonicide is a terrible thing
[2:34:04] <GunlaEXE> SRB1 is not really worth it as much
[2:34:04] <Fujiwara_92> PogChamp
[2:34:08] <yet_another_brony> GOOGLE SRB1
[2:34:31] <+kyh9> Sonic
[2:34:32] <dabirSA> yeah reggie's right, SRB1 is the exact kind of sonic fangame you'd get from a 15 year old in 1995 or whatever it was with some coding skill but no artistic talent whatsoever
[2:34:33] <+kyh9> Mania
[2:34:34] <+kyh9> 2
[2:34:34] <Solidnick18> This was a sick fan game
[2:34:37] <Vyneci> Sonic Robo Blast follows Persona rules. Just like how Persona starts at 3, SRB starts at 2 Kappa
[2:34:38] <Csagets> @WoolieVersus SEGA actually almost went in this direction with the cancelled Sonic Xtreme for the Saturn
[2:34:38] <%Superbro64> time to play sugoiii woolie then Kappa
[2:34:38] <andrei11dr> Mania
[2:34:42] <%Superbro64> there is also sonic top down
[2:34:42] <+kyh9> Sonic Mania TWO
[2:34:44] <Solidnick18> Mania Kreygasm
[2:34:51] <%FuqBoiSlim> SONIC 3D BLAST 2
[2:34:53] <dickbuttwoman> SAGE and RAGE are always a blast
[2:35:03] <%FuqBoiSlim> continuity?
[2:35:13] <rockmansrb2> BTW you can play Metal Sonic now.
[2:35:20] <Vyneci> Just give us Sonic Mania with 100% original stages, it's free money
[2:35:27] <+PorterOfGames> @FuqBoiSlim You need only turn on models to activate Sonic Robo Blast 2 3D
[2:35:33] <GunlaEXE> that being said, if you want to take a look at some of the older levels, take a look for Final Demo Zone, which is several older 1.09 maps linked together
[2:35:41] <andrei11dr> Oh man, Sonic Mania 2 would be the shit Kreygasm
[2:35:42] <%SomersaultJustice> hmm, I dunno about that
[2:35:43] <Fujiwara_92> LUL
[2:35:46] <+PorterOfGames> Which, yes, there are models made by JeckJims that you can use
[2:35:47] <Quietshun13> wut
[2:35:49] <Explodincatz> sounds terrible
[2:35:51] <Charrybdizs> SRB1 was a little children's product, SRB2 is ascended
[2:35:52] <am_omega> Ew no
[2:35:56] <+jiggy_snipe> naw
[2:35:58] <andrei11dr> NOOOOO
[2:35:58] <+miyoles> have they seen Sonic Utopia? that fan game is legit
[2:35:59] <+theAncopro> maybe zelda 2
[2:36:03] <jdwhalen> That would make replaying them so much better goddamn
[2:36:03] <%Superbro64> chat, just to let you know. Woolie has wier d tastes
[2:36:04] <+kyh9> Kind of like Octopath Traveler
[2:36:04] <heartlesshealer> Depends on the genre type
[2:36:04] <+stoutfish> eh, it suits sonic due to acceleration
[2:36:05] <Fujiwara_92> that really dont sound good LUL
[2:36:05] <+JorDandere> triGasm triGasm triGasm
[2:36:07] <%Superbro64> telling you all now
[2:36:10] <+CptBritches> That would take away from the feeling of OoT
[2:36:11] <TomFrank> an actual 3d link to the past stylized like this would be cool
[2:36:16] <+kyh9> Octopath Traveler tier
[2:36:16] <GunlaEXE> does that make srb1 is the happy meal toy
[2:36:25] <%SomersaultJustice> could try Chantelise
[2:36:25] <heartlesshealer> Maybe if the camera wasn't as important for OoT
[2:36:25] <%BioHunter> crazy talk has activated
[2:36:28] <presque> That's a bad take
[2:36:34] <%Superbro64> this is in fact a bad take
[2:36:37] <+stoutfish> HAHA! ONE!
[2:36:40] <openeyeswideawake> knuckles looks kinda melted
[2:36:43] <%Superbro64> I am fine with only srb2 looking like this
[2:36:46] <am_omega> This is a cursed tier bad take.
[2:36:47] <rockmansrb2> So do you wanna play multiplayer?
[2:36:50] <andrei11dr> If that would happen, than we would never get the 3d of today @woolieversus
[2:36:55] <powerprotoman> BAD TAKE
[2:37:00] <Charrybdizs> I feel that! I LOVE sprites with lo-fi 3d
[2:37:02] <+theAncopro> im cool with the idea of more styles like this
[2:37:03] <+nekodelic> not good take
[2:37:05] <Explodincatz> it would be a worse camera than OoT had
[2:37:06] <%Superbro64> woolie might get mad burned when this lp uploads in youtube LUL
[2:37:07] <Charrybdizs> like pokemon black
[2:37:16] <+CarlosEoM> maybe were not
[2:37:19] <+miyoles> It wont feel good
[2:37:21] <+paladinstarbuster> no
[2:37:21] <Fujiwara_92> maybe OpieOP
[2:37:24] <zhu000> better controls first
[2:37:24] <%SomersaultJustice> "no you don't get it, mine would be good tho"
[2:37:26] <heartlesshealer> Just wrong choice of game since you need the camera a lot in that one
[2:37:26] <%Superbro64> no :)
[2:37:29] <+Psycosis> id be down
[2:37:31] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> if you assume it doesn't look bad, it won't look bad
[2:37:31] <+Hylian726> Yeah that sounds sick @WoolieVersus I'm down
[2:37:32] <heartlesshealer> but good style hell yes
[2:37:33] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:37:34] <Charrybdizs> There's some indie, Nanokin, that is a lot like what you're talking about
[2:37:35] <openeyeswideawake> I'd watch you play it for a stream or two @WoolieVersus
[2:37:35] <JayPastaForce> it's doable. Chat has no imagination.
[2:37:37] <andrei11dr> Still no
[2:37:37] <Charrybdizs> I love how it looks
[2:37:38] <segbas2004> it would look much better than the old 3D Zelda
[2:37:40] <+CptBritches> No, the early looking 3D gives a very specific feeling/atmosphere
[2:37:40] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I'd be willing to try it
[2:37:40] <+theAncopro> the style is good
[2:37:41] <%FuqBoiSlim> I would like to see more games with this graphics style
[2:37:42] <Explodincatz> C A M E R A
[2:37:44] <Quietshun13> eh
[2:37:51] <+miyoles> it sounds like moving him around will be very awkward and slidey
[2:37:52] <heartlesshealer> Nanokin?
[2:37:53] <%FuqBoiSlim> you checkin out the other characters?
[2:37:56] <+theAncopro> just dont toouch my ocarina
[2:38:00] <segbas2004> ocarina of time looks like shit now.
[2:38:01] <%Superbro64> AREIAL GARDEN
[2:38:07] <Siregulus> damn you should show off Haunted Heights for reggie tho
[2:38:08] <%Superbro64> OH DEAR GOD thats a level
[2:38:13] <Skeletonmanners> get all emeralds it unlocks cool stuff
[2:38:14] <openeyeswideawake> NUT
[2:38:15] <dabirSA> aerial garden isn't a level
[2:38:19] <+theAncopro> all emerald run starts now
[2:38:22] <dabirSA> it's FOUR stapled together to make the engine cry
[2:38:22] <am_omega> Oh shit did someone drop Nanokin? I watch the artists streams from time to time.
[2:38:22] <GunlaEXE> aerial garden is a marathon
[2:38:23] <%SomersaultJustice> punch tings
[2:38:26] <Solidnick18> The blow thrower
[2:38:27] <openeyeswideawake> mokydoBop mokydoBop mokydoBop mokydoBop mokydoBop mokydoBop
[2:38:29] <am_omega> Check him out he is cool.
[2:38:33] <%Superbro64> I know, areial garden is something else
[2:38:38] <+Psycosis> He dont chuckle
[2:38:44] <andrei11dr> I would take that for FF7 just have the FF6 style +3d
[2:38:50] <GunlaEXE> azure temple tho
[2:38:53] <dabirSA> knuckles is the dealbreaker for the control style woolie's using imho
[2:38:53] <hellkhat> what sonic si this
[2:38:54] <+PorterOfGames> Only play Aerial Garden if you like pain
[2:38:56] <Charrybdizs> yeah the nanokin dev is in my music commuity so i keep up with it, I love the visual style myself too
[2:38:59] <%Superbro64> someone tell woolie srb2 top down, and the fan pack kawaii and sugoiii levels exist too
[2:38:59] <%SomersaultJustice> knucles has an ailen head thing going on
[2:39:09] <%gatorafan> No chuckle playthrough daedra1DerpyTibs
[2:39:09] <+CarlosEoM> Megaman Legends is where is at
[2:39:16] <am_omega> Holy shit someone else who knows about Nanokin.
[2:39:17] <%Superbro64> sugoi, kawai, and suburashi I think are their names
[2:39:19] <dabirSA> controlling knuckles's gliding with this control style is shit
[2:39:29] <openeyeswideawake> mokydoBop mokydoBop mokydoBop mokydoBop mokydoBop mokydoBop
[2:39:38] <%Superbro64> knuckles was made for fickles mod, that's how I played this game
[2:39:49] <%Superbro64> I still MASSIVELY perfer kart over this
[2:39:53] <Siregulus> @WoolieVersus Show off Haunted Heights afterwards for the stream, it's really good
[2:40:02] <+paladinstarbuster> ohno
[2:40:04] <andrei11dr> Megaman X 7 is the true way to bring 2d too 3d Kappa
[2:40:05] <dabirSA> I always enjoyed playing knuckles with kb+m mode, hated it with this mode, simple controls make him amazing
[2:40:13] <dabirSA> it's seriously just like what if sonic adventure was good
[2:40:13] <+pectusumbra> alright just showed up, what am I looking at?
[2:40:17] <%Superbro64> srb2
[2:40:19] <%FuqBoiSlim> is there cheat codes for this? like to unlock all the bonus levels
[2:40:23] <heartlesshealer> Okay yeah, Nanokin looks cool
[2:40:26] <Prism_Wing> sbfpScared sbfpYeyeye sbfpMember sbfpDattebayo sbfpGreen
[2:40:29] <%SomersaultJustice> Crusi'n through this World
[2:40:30] <+Shindeil> I liked the Link sprite in Four Swords & Minish Cap. I feel like that sprite could work in a sprite 3D Zelda game.
[2:40:31] <%FuqBoiSlim> sonic colors ds version
[2:40:33] <+PorterOfGames> Knuckles wasn't specifically made with Fickle's camera mod, but you can still control him fine without it, just takes some adjusting
[2:40:35] <Siregulus> @pectusumbra Sonic Robo Blast 2
[2:40:38] <powerprotoman> i was actually gonna talk about nanokin
[2:40:41] <dabirSA> @FuqBoiSlim you could download a complete save file
[2:40:52] <+pectusumbra> thanks
[2:40:56] <heartlesshealer> their twitter is StudioAnjin if anyone's curious about Nanokin
[2:41:00] <am_omega> Wow all these folks talking about Nanokin. I remember when it was just a idea.
[2:41:04] <%Superbro64> fickles camera mod decouples the air actions with the camera lock thing, so I prefer it @PorterOfGames
[2:41:11] <%Superbro64> good day Porter by the way
[2:41:20] <ThatsCriCri> I play this game every 5 years or so and everytime there something new to at
[2:41:39] <Vyneci> Huh, wonder how Fang does them
[2:41:40] <%gatorafan> NTR
[2:41:42] <am_omega> Studio Anjin is great by the way.
[2:41:43] <Solidnick18> OH AMY
[2:41:46] <%SomersaultJustice> oh no
[2:41:47] <Fujiwara_92> cute
[2:41:53] <+PorterOfGames> That's fine if you prefer it that way, just saying it's not impossible to get used to
[2:41:57] <+PorterOfGames> Also, ye, helo
[2:41:58] <+paladinstarbuster> risie
[2:41:59] <zamzoph> *glomp*
[2:41:59] <%SomersaultJustice> can you drop her in the water?
[2:42:02] <blackkanye> piss off lass
[2:42:11] <%FuqBoiSlim> HANDS OFF ME THOT
[2:42:11] <rockmansrb2> You can now play as Amy
[2:42:12] <Desertfishing> back off thot
[2:42:18] <%Superbro64> Doubtless kbm control existed before gamepads were plugged into srb2
[2:42:20] <+Psycosis> the art looks so good
[2:42:23] <Solidnick18> play feng
[2:42:27] <Solidnick18> fang*
[2:42:29] <andrei11dr> Fuck oh THOT
[2:42:33] <+pectusumbra> so this is like a fan game?
[2:42:34] <%SomersaultJustice> it just turns into doom
[2:42:37] <%gatorafan> GUN
[2:42:40] <Valentinius_Anodyne> GUN
[2:42:42] <Siregulus> @WoolieVersus jump then hold jump in the air
[2:42:43] <heartlesshealer> Fang gets plain jump
[2:42:47] <dabirSA> SOME bosses are a joke
[2:42:51] <+Psycosis> So anyway I started blastin
[2:42:56] <heartlesshealer> so he needs the gun
[2:42:59] <ThatsCriCri> Is the online mode still in though ? I remember playing it back in the days
[2:43:02] <dabirSA> fang is a half-wolf half-jerboa
[2:43:04] <andrei11dr> Now its DOOM
[2:43:05] <Desertfishing> he's tigger
[2:43:07] <heartlesshealer> okay wow

[2:43:23] <Valentinius_Anodyne> That's pretty rad
[2:43:24] <dabirSA> when he runs or falls he has to hold his hat on
[2:43:25] <%Superbro64> fang's bounce is lava immune @WoolieVersus
[2:43:25] <rockmansrb2> Woolie found the broken character.
[2:43:29] <heartlesshealer> is there mid-air shooting?
[2:43:31] <fruit_pie_the_magician> tail bounce stolen from Gex and that cheeta monkey thing
[2:43:32] <am_omega> Check out Studio Anjin's horror/soulsish game. Shits cool yo. I wish I remembered the name of that one.
[2:43:37] <dabirSA> you have to be stopped to shoot
[2:43:43] <heartlesshealer> okay
[2:43:44] <Prism_Wing> wowee!
[2:44:02] <Charrybdizs> I didn't realize nanokin wasn't their first game, huh!
[2:44:05] <dabirSA> metal sonic basically has boost mode from advance 2
[2:44:09] <+PorterOfGames> There's also dash mode
[2:44:16] <%SomersaultJustice> he is his own tails
[2:44:18] <dabirSA> when you go at high speed for a long time he glows and can punch through enemies
[2:44:23] <Prism_Wing> Metal Sonic. The original Edgehog.
[2:44:32] <Solidnick18> now amy
[2:44:34] <am_omega> Yeah they made a few short ones and one full one before they started working on Nanokin.
[2:44:34] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream
[2:44:42] <dabirSA> also metal is the other character who can turn super
[2:44:44] <+pectusumbra> The Midnight Station is the studio Anjin game you're thinking of?
[2:44:49] <%Superbro64> piko piko
[2:44:51] <Solidnick18> oh little hearts
[2:44:54] <%SomersaultJustice> she's like a musou character
[2:45:09] <rockmansrb2> Those hearts give coop players a shield.
[2:45:19] <am_omega> They had a pisstake Game of Thrones game. With Fejorah LUL
[2:45:25] <dabirSA> there's one emblem in greenflower act 2 that you have to get as amy and it really owns
[2:45:33] <Fujiwara_92> every sonic game has everyone at the same speed yeah
[2:45:35] <am_omega> It was like near season 2 of GoT too.
[2:45:42] <dabirSA> not the same speed but the same speed tier
[2:45:44] <%Superbro64> it gives them a shield, yeah
[2:45:45] <dabirSA> there's no mario-speed characters
[2:45:49] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Oh hey, The Midnight Station. Really liked that game
[2:45:49] <andrei11dr> GOTTA GO FEEEEAST
[2:45:49] <@Menitta> I hope they installed the content restoration mod for Sonic Robo Blast 2
[2:45:59] <Solidnick18> dope
[2:46:00] <+jiggy_snipe> F
[2:46:02] <dabirSA> tails is slowest, knuckles is a bit faster but jumps lower, sonic and metal sonic are fastest, amy jumps a bit higher
[2:46:04] <heartlesshealer> Nights into dreams
[2:46:05] <Fujiwara_92> super sonic
[2:46:17] <+waltzqueen> GOku Sonic
[2:46:20] <%SomersaultJustice> ABORT
[2:46:20] <yet_another_brony> metal sonic has a cool boost mode when you run interrupted
[2:46:23] <%Superbro64> with woolie's knowledge of srb2, I doubt he installed anything
[2:46:23] <+waltzqueen> Goku*
[2:46:30] <GunlaEXE> replay functionality
[2:46:30] <rockmansrb2> She can also break cracked floor tiles. Something Knuckles can't do.
[2:46:31] <dabirSA> that's for the comp replay stuff
[2:46:33] <Siregulus> NiGHTS mode has its own record attack
[2:46:38] <andrei11dr> Oh ,it's actual Nights
[2:46:39] <+waltzqueen> PogChamp GHOSTS
[2:46:39] <Solidnick18> amazing

[2:48:12] <%SomersaultJustice> so what do we do with our lives now
[2:48:15] <Valentinius_Anodyne> That's a really cool game
[2:48:15] <rockmansrb2> Thanks for playing guys.
[2:48:20] <zamzoph> it'll be great if one of these days when Woolie stops recording for YouTube he just takes off his dreads
[2:48:23] <ChaosEmralds> now for kart
[2:48:26] <dickbuttwoman> @Superbro64 I got warframe and ffxiv to play! Sorry!
[2:48:29] <%Superbro64> sonic top down when
[2:48:31] <+nekodelic> >sonic fan game >implying someone that plays it has a gf
[2:48:38] <andrei11dr> That final text was kinda sad BibleThump
[2:48:39] <blackkanye> That would be cursed @zamzoph
[2:48:55] <dickbuttwoman> Yo, read the comics.
[2:49:00] <%ChoculaUltra> so uh, you guys think Evo 2020 is getting postponed/cancelled cuz of the thing going around? Lots of other game related events/tournies have been announcing straight up cancellations left and right.
[2:49:13] <vincerocmm> i blame ken penders
[2:49:19] <%SomersaultJustice> this game can drink
[2:49:24] <absolute_cagemony> Sonic characters have really big feet. Just saying.
[2:49:26] <Casinoroyale80> !Uptime
[2:49:27] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 49 minutes
[2:49:32] <%Superbro64> I think srb2 is pre sonic adventure
[2:49:35] <am_omega> Its probably older than some people in chat LUL
[2:49:39] <Solidnick18> LUL
[2:49:43] <+nekodelic> @choculaultra is it because of the c-virus?
[2:49:43] <Potatoidea> LUL
[2:49:45] <rockmansrb2> This game is just as old, if not older than SA1
[2:49:46] <+contramann> The True Timeline
[2:49:47] <+Psycosis> mr wizard already said he has no plans to cancle EVO
[2:49:48] <yet_another_brony> ye srb2 came out before Adventure
[2:49:49] <draykon> Missed most of the Q&A. Has he mentioned anything about looking into this game's modding community? There's actually a ton of content
[2:50:02] <%FuqBoiSlim> I want to be rouge the bat's footslave
[2:50:09] <%ChoculaUltra> @nekodelic yeeeeep.
[2:50:26] <+waltzqueen> I love how htis still saids KOTOR
[2:50:35] <%SomersaultJustice> make liam play it
[2:50:43] <%ChoculaUltra> @Psycosis ah kk
[2:50:49] <+nekodelic> @choculaultra the situation is more fucked than I expected
[2:50:49] <%Superbro64> sonic unleashed day stages though
[2:50:56] <+miyoles> you guys should try Sonic utopia its another fun sonic fan game
[2:51:01] <dickbuttwoman> @WoolieVersus Yo, when you gonna read the comics?
[2:51:01] <Akett> Personally I still prefer SA2 over this, but both are in the same league for me.
[2:51:10] <Solidnick18> metroid ?
[2:51:13] <+paladinstarbuster> SA2 kicks this games ass
[2:51:17] <yet_another_brony> one of these days you gotta check out the level pack mods, SUGOI, SUBARASHII, and KIMOKAWAIII for genuine fun levels and creepy anime bullshit
[2:51:25] <+theAncopro> hey play freedom planet its a really good sonic fan game-- oh wait
[2:51:26] <Fathuran> !uptime
[2:51:26] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 51 minutes
[2:51:26] <TomFrank> 3d sprite zelda would be awesome
[2:51:31] <+Shindeil> @superbro64 Exactly. Unleashed 360/PS3 daytime stages, Generations Modern Sonic stages (except the Colors stage).
[2:51:31] <%Superbro64> I think woolie will go back to pretending the sonic fandom exists after this
[2:51:32] <+kyh9> T W E N T Y Y E A R S
[2:51:34] <@Menitta> Did Sonic Utopia actually become a full game?
[2:51:34] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:51:40] <%Superbro64> no
[2:51:51] <%Superbro64> the dev did have an update last year
[2:51:56] <am_omega> Again Before the Sequel and After the Sequel are amazing.
[2:52:03] <%Superbro64> but there essentially has been no update to utopia
[2:52:04] <@Menitta> So...many...people didnt know
[2:52:05] <%RioGascar> Didnt they actually hire these people?
[2:52:06] <andrei11dr> Reggie just told us we are to stupid to understand LUL
[2:52:07] <%XenoDandelion> Santana mashups
[2:52:16] <yet_another_brony> i been praising this game for decades
[2:52:18] <rockmansrb2> I've been playing since version 1.09.4 and MAN this game has come a long way.
[2:52:18] <dickbuttwoman> Yo, been pushing this shit for years, no one pays attention
[2:52:19] <draykon> I've been shilling this game since I was 12. Not my fault y'all didn't listen
[2:52:30] <+miyoles> try sonic utopia its another 3d sonic fan game.Sonic Utopia is basically the mario oddessy of sonic fan games.
[2:52:33] <%Superbro64> sonic stigma is something strong man
[2:52:34] <+nekodelic> but you can't wear a baseball cap with "gamer" written on it in this game
[2:52:36] <Prism_Wing> aaaaye
[2:52:41] <+kyh9> PS1 sprite-usage
[2:52:42] <+Spr0cket> this has got me thinking of some old games anyone remember "net fighter"? id love for that game to be re-released
[2:52:43] <@Menitta> Mega Man X7 tho Kappa
[2:52:53] <am_omega> I blame the fan base for the stigma.
[2:52:57] <GunlaEXE> x7 LMAO
[2:52:58] <heartlesshealer> NO
[2:52:59] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[2:53:02] <Prism_Wing> When's Woolie vs Megaman Legends PogChamp
[2:53:02] <rockmansrb2> Bro shut up
[2:53:03] <@Menitta> LUL
[2:53:04] <+jiggy_snipe> IT'S SO BAD
[2:53:07] <GunlaEXE> the less you know, the better.
[2:53:09] <Solidnick18> LUL
[2:53:12] <%SomersaultJustice> X7 LP confirmed
[2:53:15] <+pectusumbra> the worst megaman game period?
[2:53:18] <%gatorafan> X7 DOESN'T EXIST
[2:53:18] <+jiggy_snipe> YES!!!
[2:53:18] <Potatoidea> LUL
[2:53:19] <heartlesshealer> WE DO NOT TALK ABOUT X7 AND X8
[2:53:19] <am_omega> X6 and X7 are the worst Megaman games.
[2:53:22] <jazzygrooves__> just gave woolie PTSD LUL
[2:53:25] <+treborant> Burn to the Groumd Kappa
[2:53:26] <am_omega> X8 is fine.
[2:53:27] <dickbuttwoman> The intersection of Sonic and Megaman is Ian Flynn and the comics
[2:53:31] <projecthazoid> X8 Is greqat wtf
[2:53:34] <+kyh9> He's speaking in tongues, quick Reggie, hit him
[2:53:35] <dabirSA> once again, if you're going to check out this game after watching woolie play it, try the 3d model mod, check our your control and graphics options carefully
[2:53:35] <andrei11dr> BURN TO THE GROUND
[2:53:35] <+nekodelic> oh shit, a megaman legends in this style would be amazing
[2:53:36] <rockmansrb2> BURN! BURN! BURN TO GROU-BURN!
[2:53:36] <zenith0111> FUCK X7
[2:53:37] <darkryu31765> Why you gotta hurt me so, get that shit outta here
[2:53:38] <ChaosEmralds> x8 is good
[2:53:43] <redrins> it wasnt even a jump to 3d since megaman had already been done in 3d before
[2:53:44] <+theAncopro> earthworm jim went 3d?
[2:53:46] <GunlaEXE> unlike x6, x7 can't be memed by guard shell
[2:53:47] <+kyh9> Kirby Air Ride was good tho
[2:53:50] <heartlesshealer> If X8 is good then I guess X7 tainted it for me
[2:53:53] <dabirSA> there's a lot of customisation available in how you play SRB2
[2:53:55] <heartlesshealer> and I apologize
[2:53:58] <+Psycosis> BRRRtT to the ground
[2:53:58] <@Menitta> Lmao

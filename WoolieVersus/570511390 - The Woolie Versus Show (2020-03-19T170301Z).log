[0:01:31] <+chvmpchange> ngl I'm crazy hype for woolie eventually getting to HL2
[0:01:37] <Haarute> y'all ready for some theorical physics.
[0:01:54] <%StaceMcGate> I'd rather see RE 3 Demo or DOOM but this is fine LUL
[0:02:02] <Willfordbrimly> I'm theoretically interested in physics
[0:02:21] <MassConnect> strike while iron is cold @StaceMcGate
[0:03:15] <%RioGascar> so chat has it just been constantly raining around you too?
[0:03:23] <%RioGascar> It wont stop fucking raining
[0:03:25] <MassConnect> sort of
[0:03:38] <@Solidus_113> I don't have timefall
[0:03:41] <%tearknack> damp and spitty, but no serious rain here
[0:04:01] <fist_wizard_jay> Downtown Chicago was plastered in giga thick fog for the last 5 or so hours
[0:04:02] <FuqBoiSlim> LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[0:04:02] <%RioGascar> timefall rain would be fucked so hard
[0:04:04] <BeijiWeng> jbxSalute Lord Woolie and chat
[0:04:05] <Infinit_Phoenix> destiny just went down for maintenance perfect time to sit down for a stream
[0:04:15] <PsychedelicSnake> I require this chat to be nothing but Freeman's mind jokes
[0:04:26] <MassConnect> i didn't see last night - wooliee knows the fight news?
[0:04:38] <%RioGascar> what if i wanna be full life consequences instead
[0:04:45] <%StaceMcGate> He retweeted the Rollback netcode announcement I believe
[0:04:47] <%tearknack> @MassConnect do you think woolie knows the fighting game news
[0:05:18] <MassConnect> let's not tell him :P
[0:05:23] <%tearknack> do you think that A he hasn't been paying attention and B that a couple thousand people didn't retweet it at him
[0:05:26] <%RioGascar> He knows
[0:06:08] <StarlitStunner> stripHi Hello Chatroom
[0:06:43] <Haarute> hey

[0:07:35] <+Mr_Pylon> Hoy all
[0:07:45] <+chvmpchange> I think Woolie's really gonna dig Xen
[0:07:46] <fist_wizard_jay> I cant wait for my Doom Eternal CE comes in
[0:07:58] <%RioGascar> Xen is far far away
[0:08:07] <+chvmpchange> true
[0:08:07] <andrei11dr> Black Mesa ? That means Reggie is alive! PogChamp
[0:08:07] <PsychedelicSnake> I wonder how many GMan enounters he'll miss this time LUL
[0:08:23] <honeyman18> Well Woolie experiencing Half Life for the first time is a good stream for today!
[0:08:49] <%RioGascar> Tbf the only reason people saw the old gman encounters was cause the graphics were so simple seeing anything was important
[0:08:51] <%StaceMcGate> I honest to god think that DOOM Eternal is lagging the steam page
[0:08:54] <BeijiWeng> comedyOkay . o O ( Wisely done mr freeman )
[0:09:11] <%RioGascar> with this one unless you know the original spots you probably wont be looking at then
[0:09:18] <@Squdnate> I have iced coffee, RE3 demo downloading on Steam, and now Woolie & Reggie Black Mesa sciencing it
[0:09:22] <@Squdnate> It's a joy
[0:09:34] <andrei11dr> Iea Doom is out, e need to get that shit right now
[0:09:40] <+chvmpchange> the gman sightings are supposed to be missable

[0:29:07] <+doc_ock_rokc> Play good not perfectly
[0:29:08] <%RioGascar> i've seen speedruns but STILL peopel take damage
[0:29:16] <MassConnect> sounds like a job for mitten squad
[0:29:19] <%RioGascar> i dont think so
[0:29:20] <@akuda_bar> https://clips.twitch.tv/BrainyAbrasiveSoymilkDatSheffy
[0:29:26] <%Javaa01> Damage is a core part of speedrunning Half Life anyways
[0:29:26] <+glgzephyr> that menu sound is therapeutic
[0:29:33] <PsychedelicSnake> Remember, there is totally going to be soldiers coming tohelp you. Only help you. Nothing else.
[0:29:35] <%CaptainPileDriver> lol, yeah, those marvel characters suck

[0:29:58] <BeijiWeng> comedyOkay 👍
[0:30:10] <%Javaa01> For now
[0:30:13] <+glgzephyr> who ever heard of a lapdesk
[0:30:13] <andrei11dr> Once the military show's up he'll probably stop crowbaring everything
[0:30:14] <%Irridium> gotta get yourself a couchmaster
[0:30:17] <Fujiwara_92> @woolieversus
[0:30:32] <$megamonmon123> @captainpiledriver they are on the new warriors not the avengers. They were never meant to "save" marvel
[0:30:39] <DedlokPM> Get a Gamer Cube to solve your Mouse On Couch woes. psaWhat
[0:30:40] <%Javaa01> You can, you just hold the watch button
[0:30:43] <StarlitStunner> A gamer cube like Patto
[0:30:46] <UnfilteredComic> RP waik
[0:30:47] <+glgzephyr> I am sitting in bed right now with my keyboard and mouse on my lapdesk and it is the shit
[0:30:50] <Haarute> you hold the walk button.
[0:30:51] <Djinnazz> Shift
[0:30:51] <+kitsisto> its SOOOOOO frustrating
[0:30:52] <Seamus_McKraken> I still don't understand how anyone uses a controller for FPS games
[0:30:53] <%Javaa01> Because Half Life doesn't have a run button, it has a walk button
[0:31:00] <%tearknack> yes you can
[0:31:02] <Fujiwara_92> Gamer Cubes rise up
[0:31:04] <LeaIsChill> Would you invest in a pressure sensitive WASD?
[0:31:08] <%Javaa01> Black Mesa added the run button
[0:31:08] <+sir_louis> LUL
[0:31:10] <Laironx3> keyboard and controller bitterSmug
[0:31:11] <majima666> i dont have a problem using controllers in fps games
[0:31:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> @megamonmon123 some of the first new characters they've made that are supposed to be inclusive and it's those
[0:31:13] <%tearknack> in games with walk/run/sprint states
[0:31:14] <Djinnazz> You totally can
[0:31:14] <+doc_ock_rokc> @LeaIsChill yes
[0:31:16] <+Exyoh> There's no inbetween for shift or no shift
[0:31:16] <@Solidus_113> good games usually have a walk toggle
[0:31:17] <majima666> but thats cause im a console pleb
[0:31:25] <BeijiWeng> jbxDong
[0:31:26] <+jiggy_snipe> probably need a toggle or button

[0:34:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> @megamonmon123 those characters are just as bad as those shitty edgy characters from the 90's era, written by people who don't understand anything
[0:34:33] <%Irridium> are you still there~
[0:34:39] <Bennett_Fracture> 3 is also a crowd...
[0:34:42] <%RioGascar> this segment is very smart
[0:34:44] <zamzoph> I think the game is trying to tell you something
[0:34:44] <FuqBoiSlim> you cant crowbar your way out of this one
[0:34:49] <%RioGascar> it shows how EVERYTHING WORKS
[0:34:54] <PsychedelicSnake> but grenades tho
[0:34:59] <beatie_g> wait aren't those millitary turrets?
[0:35:06] <%RioGascar> turrets are not discriminating and just fire at anyone
[0:35:10] <honeyman18> Activator, not a multi use
[0:35:11] <LeaIsChill> Explosions are...big?
[0:35:13] <$megamonmon123> @captainpiledriver im not saying they are good but this is less desparation and more a really really dumb idea
[0:35:14] <PsychedelicSnake> Woolie, explosions have a wave of concussive force
[0:35:18] <andrei11dr> Look at all of those grenades
[0:35:19] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:35:21] <%Javaa01> Don't eat the explosions
[0:35:29] <DSD24> Look a these dead rescue team members

[0:35:57] <@Solidus_113> I don't blame you
[0:36:14] <majima666> @DesertPenguin probably once or twice. jack and coke is my poison and ive had some of the different varients
[0:36:15] <Rosewater_444> that big
[0:36:18] <PsychedelicSnake> Explosions are to Woolie as slide puzzles are to Pat
[0:36:18] <%itmegwimble> Explosions make a big shockwave that fucks shit up.
[0:36:22] <Seamus_McKraken> thats actually huge
[0:36:25] <%RioGascar> @WoolieVersus Tip: barrels and explosive boxs in half life dont explode instantly unless shot a lot. if you shoot it 3 times it first sets on fire for a short time and then explodes. this allows you to run away
[0:36:27] <Rosewater_444> in all directiond
[0:36:30] <honeyman18> Vaguely big booms
[0:36:33] <%tearknack> get that shield woolie
[0:36:35] <Seamus_McKraken> compared to the original and HL2
[0:36:37] <+DesertPenguin> I've been a fan of the Jack Daniels Honey but my parents got a shit ton of stuff when they went to the Caribbean in February
[0:36:38] <%tearknack> please
[0:36:40] <+DesertPenguin> It's so cheap there

[0:36:53] <Snorlax47> *teleport behind you*
[0:36:58] <%linSP> Yo portal 2 couch coop with Reggie would be dope
[0:37:00] <%tearknack> gordon
[0:37:02] <%itmegwimble> Like if you're underwater when an explosion goes off your lungs will cave in and collapse because of the pressure caused by the shockwave

[0:38:38] <%Louie_Salmon> I wonder if that's intentional? Would be a nice bit of environmental hinting
[0:38:42] <%Javaa01> Cyan has more green in it, it's turquoise
[0:38:43] <+DesertPenguin> I'm colorblind and I know it's in the green family at least

[0:40:24] <beatie_g> I don't hate you... :(
[0:40:36] <%Javaa01> Once the turrets that are assigned to a laser are destoyed, the laser turns off
[0:40:41] <Bennett_Fracture> spin it around and 3 can becom E... W... and M...
[0:40:43] <%Louie_Salmon> Oof
[0:40:45] <PsychedelicSnake> Why is Woolie's run stuttering so much
[0:40:48] <%RioGascar> this god damn game improved so much on half life 1's formula and design
[0:40:50] <bleugh> dat source jitter
[0:40:50] <DSD24> Damn that shotgun nearly broke the game
[0:40:57] <+DesertPenguin> It's so weird to see FPS games played without ADS
[0:40:58] <Seamus_McKraken> if the turret has a camera to detect targets, why does it need a triplaser?
[0:40:59] <SomersaultJustice> does the game stutter like that often?
[0:41:06] <@Solidus_113> doo doo
[0:41:08] <+croxeye> so have the military helped to rescue woolie yet :V?
[0:41:10] <PsychedelicSnake> It didn't stutter on mine
[0:41:11] <+chvmpchange> Its so wierd because I just played through the entire game and I didnt get a single stutter
[0:41:16] <mMayrro> woolie I think your pc is dying... psaWhat
[0:41:18] <%Javaa01> It's building a cache, so it's a bit stuttery
[0:41:22] <SorinMarkov54> Garry’s Mod has a VR add on
[0:41:23] <natebud> Grenades are very bad in this game. Even worse than OG half life
[0:41:25] <AlfredoCavatelli> you can bind grenade throw to a button in the options
[0:41:26] <honeyman18> Source engine is a pile of ductape on the quake 1 engine so yeah, its gonna be like that
[0:41:26] <%tearknack> @chvmpchange black mes, or og hl1?
[0:41:27] <%Javaa01> When new assets need to be called
[0:41:28] <%Irridium> ah the old days where grenades were a weapon you had to swap to
[0:41:30] <beatie_g> idk what it is but I'll blame windows updates regardless
[0:41:32] <+DesertPenguin> I just had to install updates to Windows10 this morning. Anyone else?
[0:41:32] <+chvmpchange> he definitely has it installed on an HDD
[0:41:32] <UnfilteredComic> I didnt have any stutter when i played, maybe there is bad setting on

[0:57:54] <PsychedelicSnake> Conserve ammo if you don't gotta shootbang
[0:58:03] <+doc_ock_rokc> @WoolieVersus you don't need to shoot them
[0:58:13] <Memdosu> this episode of woolie will figure it out LUL
[0:58:34] <+PapaGravestone> How would a headcrab taste? I'm thinking like octopus
[0:58:37] <%RioGascar> i do like how woolie is learning all the lessons valve set up with half life
[0:58:39] <natebud> hey look satchel charges, I'll just blow up the tentacles @GeneralSCPatton
[0:58:41] <BrunenG_> @WoolieVersus Though you said it's not SBF2 it does the same thing for me, bringing fun and intertainment even in bad times. thanks
[0:58:46] <%RioGascar> and learning it at the correct pace
[0:58:51] <Solidnick18> OH
[0:58:54] <%itmegwimble> Headcrab would probably taste like a slightly sour/acidic chicken.
[0:58:57] <Martianorbit> we Doom now?
[0:59:01] <%Javaa01> Now throw nades
[0:59:06] <PsychedelicSnake> dont go down
[0:59:07] <$Essixian> WE GOT A NERD! *Brrap brrap*
[0:59:07] <andrei11dr> That guy got DOOMED LUL
[0:59:11] <DSD24> Call the ambulance but not for me
[0:59:14] <+crimsonharvest> you dont need to even mess with the laser hall
[0:59:15] <oyyzzo> open fire, gordon!
[0:59:15] <%itmegwimble> Think of a slightly spoiled milk taste vs normal milk and apply it to chicken. That's what headcrab would taste like.
[0:59:16] <%king_wragles> WOOLIE WHY
[0:59:16] <natebud> Just drop off on the other side
[0:59:18] <%Javaa01> They only shoot LIVING things
[0:59:19] <arkv01> yo this PACIFIST HAS NO WEAPON LETS BEAT HIS ASS
[0:59:37] <Tucker0603> holy shit woolie
[0:59:40] <%RioGascar> they even shoot military if i remember
[0:59:43] <%linSP> he’s got a gun! For real tho!!

[1:00:34] <$Essixian> Woolie... lprodNOTLIKETHIS
[1:00:35] <andrei11dr> JUST USE GRENADES
[1:00:37] <rubbishbinge> all according to kek
[1:00:38] <%king_wragles> My favorite part was when Woolie held the turret to his own face.
[1:00:41] <+crimsonharvest> this is the real woolie hole
[1:00:42] <%Javaa01> The mines will kill the two turrets on that side
[1:00:42] <natebud> or just pick them up and turn them around
[1:00:45] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @turbofolk
[1:00:47] <+mankeyfigh> Just grenade
[1:00:48] <Tucker0603> WAKE ME UP INSIDE
[1:00:49] <%Javaa01> Once you nade that side
[1:00:51] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> someone fart on woolie
[1:00:51] <SixthSun2> I see Bumble Mesa is going well
[1:00:57] <natebud> Or avoid the lasers
[1:00:58] <+mankeyfigh> CANT WAKE UP
[1:00:59] <turbofolk> You MISUNDERSTOOD HOW TURRETS WORK
[1:01:03] <andrei11dr> Woolie thinks grenades are like BFG and doesn't use them
[1:01:05] <%Javaa01> Also quicksave, for god's sake
[1:01:05] <LeaIsChill> LUL
[1:01:12] <%linSP> Is the game audio a little loud for anyone else
[1:01:13] <%ekodrop> cool reggie is back
[1:01:13] <%GeneralSCPatton> @king_wragles If he swallows all the bullets, he can safely poop them out
[1:01:23] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Punch mom is like Pat while Woolie is like Paige
[1:01:24] <beatie_g> guys, RELAX. Woolie Will Figure It Out :)
[1:01:25] <%king_wragles> @GeneralSCPatton big brane dot jay peg
[1:01:27] <zayasu> yeah game is a bit loud
[1:01:28] <Tucker0603> woolie is baffled by turrets
[1:01:31] <+croxeye> yo Reggie get Woolie to turn on always run in the options!!!!!
[1:01:39] <Djinnazz> Save often
[1:01:42] <%RioGascar> woolie is learning rules of turrets
[1:01:46] <shamuzu> guys, relax with the backseat gaming
[1:01:52] <%Javaa01> You get to deal with the problem for free from up here
[1:01:52] <+DesertPenguin> What is the mission objective right now?
[1:02:03] <%RioGascar> survive?
[1:02:04] <natebud> All he has to do is drop on the other side to avoid the lasers
[1:02:08] <%RioGascar> escape black mesa i guess
[1:02:14] <Solidnick18> juicy
[1:02:37] <%GeneralSCPatton> Not replaying the same section over and over? What a concept!
[1:03:02] <PsychedelicSnake> amazing
[1:03:03] <resloxxx> LUL
[1:03:07] <Solidnick18> oh it got the door
[1:03:07] <CrimsonSilver4> Right now it's to get outside of the facility and wait for help to arrive. the help has arrived but they aren't helping much.
[1:03:13] <PsychedelicSnake> HOW
[1:03:13] <@Solidus_113> LMAO
[1:03:14] <+crimsonharvest> what in the fuck
[1:03:15] <Solidnick18> perfect

[1:03:22] <%jepupu> What difficulty is this?
[1:03:23] <BlueMoonBlues> ezpz
[1:03:24] <LeaIsChill> Woolie playing this like a puzzle game
[1:03:24] <rubbishbinge> nailed it
[1:03:24] <NotHereToStream> well it worked
[1:03:26] <%RioGascar> well thats one way to solve it
[1:03:27] <Snorlax47> Flawless
[1:03:27] <+that_Mojo_Izakku> first try
[1:03:27] <+jiggy_snipe> the nade exploded immediately
[1:03:28] <PsychedelicSnake> save that fucking game
[1:03:32] <$Essixian> NAILED IT
[1:03:34] <natebud> Black Mesa is really easy guys
[1:03:37] <%GeneralSCPatton> YOU TOOK TWO MINES AND A GRENADE TO THE FACE
[1:03:38] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:03:40] <+crimsonharvest> did you deflect an explosion with your own explosion
[1:03:43] <Dr_Mooose> LUL
[1:03:46] <G03933> this is more of a crawl-through
[1:03:46] <Solidnick18> they dead
[1:03:52] <beatie_g> uh
[1:03:53] <andrei11dr> SURE DOOD LUL
[1:03:56] <chronoxgp> blackked meseta?
[1:03:57] <@Solidus_113> man who knows everything, DEAD
[1:03:57] <thesoothe> Huh?
[1:04:02] <chronoxgp> like pso2?
[1:04:02] <thesoothe> They didn't shoot him?
[1:04:15] <%RioGascar> the man who knew too much
[1:04:18] <Solidnick18> Oh no
[1:04:20] <nothuzad> chronoxgp what about pso2?
[1:04:24] <%shradke> FPS Dom Woolie
[1:04:26] <natebud> the marine AI is reaaaaally bad @thesoothe
[1:04:26] <%Javaa01> Maybe don't eat the explosive barrels
[1:04:34] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:04:35] <Amardeux> man Woolie playing this like Doom LUL
[1:04:37] <Solidnick18> LUL
[1:04:39] <TwinBat> MY LEGS
[1:04:39] <Tucker0603> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[1:04:39] <%RioGascar> fancy attempt
[1:04:42] <Haarute> you don't NEED to run at and shotgun everything
[1:04:47] <chronoxgp> the currency in pso2 is meseta, so black mesa and meseata = blackked meseta
[1:04:50] <%shradke> pulling that DOOM ledge tech lol
[1:04:52] <Joestar1890> Woolie pls, just use the smg
[1:04:55] <Dr_Mooose> going for those glory kills
[1:04:59] <+mankeyfigh> You suck bro
[1:04:59] <Solidnick18> this is doom Kappa
[1:05:02] <%Javaa01> They are NOT afraid to spam nades if you just sit in a corner
[1:05:05] <nothuzad> chronoxgp hm - ok try
[1:05:05] <andrei11dr> Woolie needs the environment upgrade from doom with those explosions LUL
[1:05:08] <thesoothe> @natebud I though they fixed that for release. Still looks bad compared to the original.
[1:05:14] <+Rewrench> at release marine AI was one of the big features. that they actually tried flanking and such. was new at the time
[1:05:24] <Amardeux> this isn't Doom woolie LUL
[1:05:31] <%Javaa01> You will be, if you can aim
[1:05:32] <%shradke> tbf this is how it would realistically go
[1:05:34] <%RioGascar> they WILL voice their actiosn however
[1:05:36] <%GeneralSCPatton> NOT DOOM
[1:05:37] <%RioGascar> so listen for them
[1:05:39] <%Irridium> pistol works at range
[1:05:43] <Haarute> pistol has more accuracy
[1:05:55] <thesoothe> Oh man.
[1:05:59] <beatie_g> xcom'd
[1:06:02] <natebud> @thesoothe Not really. Also I found out they have a really hard time hitting you if you're standing still.
[1:06:03] <PsychedelicSnake> Use the automatic weapons more
[1:06:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> What even is accuracy?
[1:06:06] <+tuchpi> LUL
[1:06:06] <%Javaa01> The mouse is right there
[1:06:07] <+jiggy_snipe> lul
[1:06:09] <chronoxgp> if you remember the recoil pattern and paintball you'll do fine
[1:06:11] <%linSP> Jades work great too
[1:06:11] <%RioGascar> did they remove the hecu melee mouse?
[1:06:12] <andrei11dr> Maybe he should use range in this fps
[1:06:15] <FuqBoiSlim> CONTROLLER AIM LUL
[1:06:16] <%linSP> Nades *
[1:06:16] <%RioGascar> *move
[1:06:24] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Woolie don't worry I am totally the same way with First Person Shooters
[1:06:25] <beatie_g> WTF
[1:06:29] <%RioGascar> wait they have rocket launcehrs?
[1:06:33] <%RioGascar> never fucking saw that
[1:06:35] <PsychedelicSnake> I play with controller and I did fine. I think it's just Woolie trying to play this like DOOM
[1:06:37] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> wait... maybe worry I can never beat them lolz
[1:06:38] <beatie_g> was that always there?
[1:06:51] <%Javaa01> The RPGs are new, heavies have them now
[1:06:56] <$Essixian> I can't believe that worked LUL
[1:06:59] <natebud> Woolie don't move. stand completely still with the pistol and shoot them from a distance. They have no counter
[1:07:02] <andrei11dr> Just block those bullets with your face like Kenshiro
[1:07:02] <NWannabe> SG reload sounds giving me TF classic nostalgia
[1:07:03] <Th3rd3> Shotgun CQC
[1:07:13] <%Javaa01> Oh yeah, there are still people around
[1:07:24] <beatie_g> really if you kill em fast enough they can't damage you you
[1:07:24] <FuqBoiSlim> uh oh
[1:07:24] <+Johannen> Game audio is realy loud
[1:07:38] <Zeemod155> ?
[1:07:40] <@Solidus_113> it's not really
[1:07:48] <@chesterr01> how is the audio during fights?
[1:07:51] <%GeneralSCPatton> Ignored the ammo on the counter
[1:07:53] <beatie_g> FUG
[1:07:54] <resloxxx> OOF
[1:07:55] <+prime_name> SPLAT
[1:07:56] <TwinBat> GOING IN
[1:07:56] <%rytyoung> mushy guts
[1:07:57] <Snorlax47> Pog
[1:07:57] <+mankeyfigh> Just go
[1:08:02] <chronoxgp> whoolie you can get 1 or 2 really accurate shots with the pistol before recoil takes off
[1:08:04] <FuqBoiSlim> he exploded
[1:08:07] <beatie_g> shotgun > all
[1:08:12] <Haarute> the pistol has the most accuracy at range
[1:08:13] <%Javaa01> Oh this is babby shit
[1:08:14] <%itmegwimble> ^
[1:08:17] <@Solidus_113> You could say... It's Hostile
[1:08:18] <beatie_g> DOOM has taught you well I see
[1:08:20] <datdemo> Why does Wolie just run at them with a shotgun?
[1:08:21] <Snorlax47> Shot gun best gun
[1:08:23] <%linSP> Difference between doom and source is the ai bullets arrive instantly here so you can’t dodge and weave like those slow demon fireballs
[1:08:27] <bleugh> perhaps man is the true monster...
[1:08:29] <zannablooke> maybe people are the real monsters after all...
[1:08:30] <%itmegwimble> I meant that arrow to point to the shotgun being best
[1:08:32] <%king_wragles> Does it not let Woolie setup a keybind for quick save and quick load?
[1:08:32] <%itmegwimble> Now I am the fool
[1:08:35] <$Essixian> Oh my god the shotgun reloads one more shell than it's supposed to every time, that is the fucking WORST BUG
[1:08:41] <chronoxgp> aim for the head whoolie
[1:08:44] <chronoxgp> or body
[1:08:47] <Joestar1890> Yes..."questioning"
[1:08:50] <resloxxx> "questioning" : how fast would you like to die sir?
[1:09:13] <Snorlax47> You got nothing, good day, sir
[1:09:14] <PsychedelicSnake> holy shit woolie
[1:09:25] <zannablooke> i love woolie's jump ins on the enemies
[1:09:26] <thesoothe> Wouldn't he play a little better with a mouse?
[1:09:28] <%KingOfTheGeats> playing this like Doom
[1:09:29] <chronoxgp> he's playing with a controller omg what an idiot lol
[1:09:33] <PsychedelicSnake> fuckin rekt
[1:09:33] <Solidnick18> LUL
[1:09:34] <+tuchpi> LUL
[1:09:35] <Dr_Mooose> dropped
[1:09:36] <Snorlax47> ded
[1:09:36] <natebud> @thesoothe of course
[1:09:37] <beatie_g> ow I tripped
[1:09:39] <Tucker0603> LUL LUL LUL
[1:09:39] <andrei11dr> Welp
[1:09:45] <%Irridium> git gud
[1:09:48] <%Javaa01> You track with the mouse
[1:09:49] <SomersaultJustice> and you're to blame
[1:09:50] <natebud> Just stand still with the pistol.
[1:09:51] <%RioGascar> i might have falsely prepared woolie for this game by saying DONT WORRY ABOUT DAMAGE
[1:09:53] <%itmegwimble> He should probably at least *try* the mouse
[1:09:55] <beatie_g> what's LIMA?
[1:09:57] <chronoxgp> we have reached new levels holy shit whoolie put the controller down, this is a SOURCE engine game
[1:09:57] <%NovaKnightmare> NovaKnightmare subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! Hey Woolie, what's a worse situation: Escaping a facility attakced by Aliens and Special Forces or Doing a bunch of physics test for a homicial yet AI?
[1:10:00] <$Essixian> Woolie, the mouse and keyboard is RIGHT THERE.
[1:10:03] <+mankeyfigh> Or the assault rifle
[1:10:04] <Djinnazz> Woolie still in Doom guy mode.
[1:10:04] <Amardeux> haha yeah maybe @RioGascar LUL
[1:10:06] <PsychedelicSnake> shotgun is gonna kill woolie at some point
[1:10:06] <andrei11dr> Hand up LUL
[1:10:06] <Melchior_the_Wise> you need to use the smg
[1:10:17] <+mankeyfigh> There’s no melee in this game
[1:10:22] <natebud> or just wait around the corner with the shotgun
[1:10:23] <PsychedelicSnake> At least we ca hope Woolie will mark out at the Tau cannon
[1:10:23] <emeraldskrull> woolieGLORY
[1:10:24] <+doc_ock_rokc> Machine gun is Kinda spray and pray
[1:10:28] <Djinnazz> Crowbar
[1:10:32] <%Javaa01> He dropped the nade
[1:10:35] <beatie_g> how
[1:10:36] <Tucker0603> I see Woolie is attempting the path of the facefuck
[1:10:44] <beatie_g> UNGA
[1:10:44] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1239789488349614081?s=20
[1:10:50] <natebud> grenades have a radius of like 2 feet
[1:10:51] <%Javaa01> Nah you're good
[1:10:52] <chronoxgp> can reggie play too like can he get trick shots and rim
[1:11:09] <Solidnick18> LUL
[1:11:12] <@Solidus_113> better shotgun wins
[1:11:17] <+mankeyfigh> Shields
[1:11:18] <%GeneralSCPatton> @tucker0603 It's not the worst if you know how to aim. But Woolie has forsaken the concept of aiming.
[1:11:19] <PsychedelicSnake> what's that saying about insanity again
[1:11:35] <%itmegwimble> Shit's crazy bro @psychedelicsnake
[1:11:42] <+mankeyfigh> Use the pistol
[1:11:46] <@Solidus_113> it's always faster to switch weapons over reloading
[1:11:46] <+Rewrench> AI kiting woolie. thats kinda impressive :P
[1:11:53] <chronoxgp> whoolie's vert sensitivity is too high
[1:11:54] <%Javaa01> The HECU is relatively smart, even by last gen standards
[1:11:57] <thesoothe> Oh please. Black Mesa AI seems fucked.
[1:11:57] <%RioGascar> are those shotguns like the ones in half lfie 2 combien where they fire faster than you can
[1:11:57] <aubrea> ai was way better in fear
[1:12:03] <FuqBoiSlim> woolie's chasing these dudes done like Jason LUL
[1:12:04] <beatie_g> dude can you imagine pumping a guy full of SMG rounds but he keeps chasing you with a shotgun
[1:12:07] <+jiggy_snipe> lul
[1:12:07] <mMayrro> it's just like Fear's AI
[1:12:16] <PsychedelicSnake> the scripting for the grunts in HL1 was fucking nuts. They'd lay out traps and shit
[1:12:17] <%RioGascar> fear was like
[1:12:17] <natebud> I played HL source the other day and those marines are still terrifying
[1:12:20] <%RioGascar> 2006
[1:12:21] <Snorlax47> nom
[1:12:21] <Amardeux> @beatie_g i would shit myself LUL
[1:12:21] <%Javaa01> Like games like CoD BARELY have functional AI, just a bunch of scripting to mask the lack of AI
[1:12:22] <GoDZooKii> I don't think I've ever seen someone be bad at a FPS. Pretty simple games.
[1:12:26] <beatie_g> oofie
[1:12:26] <mMayrro> ouchie ouch
[1:12:27] <@Solidus_113> your legs are brokenb
[1:12:29] <thesoothe> Seriously they even throw granades at this section in the original HL.
[1:12:34] <%RioGascar> for 1998 half life's AI was super impressive
[1:12:37] <FuqBoiSlim> oof ouch my legs
[1:12:50] <%linSP> Woolie’s more bullet than man
[1:12:53] <%RioGascar> even tho it could only do 1 move at a time
[1:12:56] <natebud> dark souls
[1:13:02] <+Okosisi89> My legs are OK
[1:13:15] <RushUnplugged> I remember thinking "Oh I'll hide behind this pillar and bounce a grenade off the wall" and seeing a grenade do the exact thing to me and kill me
[1:13:18] <%itmegwimble> Since the HEV suit automatically administers morphine when you're injured and shit, Gordon is basically wearing the god damned berserker armor
[1:13:35] <+Okosisi89> I gain Brouzouf
[1:13:36] <natebud> and he's high out of his mind
[1:13:37] <%Javaa01> Functional environments, in MY FPS game?
[1:13:42] <%Javaa01> More likely then you think
[1:13:45] <%RioGascar> i wonder if it also can administarer the stuff to not overdose on morphine
[1:13:47] <chronoxgp> HEV suit aint going to save you if you hit your head on a ceiling fan
[1:13:49] <%GeneralSCPatton> AND HE STILL SKIPPING CRATES
[1:13:57] <@Solidus_113> EYE is such a weird game
[1:14:00] <PsychedelicSnake> I remember running underneath one of those auto shop lifts later in the game and the grunts dropped that fucking thing on me.
[1:14:03] <natebud> Did those health packs not get picked up?
[1:14:05] <Snorlax47> But it has to run out of morphine at some point
[1:14:06] <emeraldskrull> he's doing it!!! woolieGLORY woolieGLORY
[1:14:14] <%Javaa01> Too many to point out
[1:14:16] <%Javaa01> Even in this room
[1:14:25] <FuqBoiSlim> nyoom
[1:14:45] <+mankeyfigh> No
[1:14:46] <andrei11dr> There's a lot of crates in this game
[1:14:47] <%Javaa01> Square crates
[1:15:01] <%freemoneymanforreal> freemoneymanforreal subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 7 month streak! 
[1:15:03] <%Javaa01> Those low crates are just cover
[1:15:31] <%itmegwimble> @riogascar NARCAN is an opioid antagonist, so it'd temporarily stop an overdose, but it wouldn't stop him from fading bakc into an overdose if the NARCAN runs out and the morphine is still in him
[1:15:31] <Conky89> How hardcore would it be in real life if we opened crates like Gordon does with his crowbar?
[1:15:34] <+mankeyfigh> Mmhmm
[1:15:38] <%RioGascar> almost got barnicled
[1:15:42] <%RioGascar> almost
[1:15:44] <natebud> That scientist is still alive LUL
[1:15:45] <%freemoneymanforreal> woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO
[1:15:49] <andrei11dr> I remember crates havin shit in them more often
[1:15:49] <Snorlax47> That scientist was alive?
[1:15:51] <beatie_g> wait that science man is still kicking
[1:15:56] <%itmegwimble> Tho the suit monitors his blood and Shit so it probably administers the perfect amount for him to not be in pain and not overdose
[1:15:57] <beatie_g> how tf
[1:16:17] <natebud> Bad marine AI, takes them like 2 minutes to kill him if you wait. LUL
[1:16:37] <BlipJaw> why did that guy make me jump in my chair
[1:16:46] <thesoothe> Are they still based on the Combine AI?
[1:16:49] <beatie_g> he had a shotgun
[1:16:50] <%RioGascar> no
[1:16:51] <PsychedelicSnake> @WoolieVersus Don't be afraid to be a huge coward
[1:16:53] <G03933> "oh crap, he came back for me!" _marine

[1:17:06] <%RioGascar> the combine dont voice their actions
[1:17:13] <natebud> @thesoothe yeah, they have that same waddling movement
[1:17:14] <%RioGascar> and also dont work in a squad
[1:17:22] <%RioGascar> at least i never got that sense
[1:17:25] <%itmegwimble> The combine totally voice stuff
[1:17:29] <%itmegwimble> You can't make it out but they do
[1:17:31] <UnfilteredComic> Its just garbled
[1:17:31] <natebud> @RioGascar yeah they kind of do, you just can't understand them
[1:17:32] <+kapcommunist> blowing my mind how he can ignore shields
[1:17:37] <%RioGascar> well fuck me
[1:17:40] <Snorlax47> they murmur stuff

[1:17:47] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[1:17:55] <Dr_Mooose> break those crates
[1:18:03] <natebud> I'm pretty sure the combine use a lot of the gestures that the marines use too
[1:18:08] <%RioGascar> i know they say "thats a grenade" when one gets close to em
[1:18:12] <GoDZooKii> Never used 1-9 to switch I always use mouse wheel myself.
[1:18:17] <%Javaa01> No it's not, it's just the pause function
[1:18:20] <%Javaa01> Anyways, buttrock
[1:18:21] <natebud> yeah, but they don't run away from grenades any more either
[1:18:22] <%RioGascar> but i dont remember them saying "throwing nade" or something

[1:20:29] <%RioGascar> wow
[1:20:29] <Conky89> I don't care for the level design at points. I get the devs wanted to make Black Mesa look more realistic, but it leaves less options for tactics.

[1:22:28] <StarlitStunner> stripIQ the only real answer @d00msdaydan
[1:22:31] <Drakenstorm13> has the game become super fuckin loud for anuone else?
[1:22:34] <FuqBoiSlim> @d00msdaydan let's goooo
[1:22:35] <+mankeyfigh> GO
[1:22:36] <Snorlax47> This is not a shotgun, this is a fucking anti-aircraft gun
[1:22:38] <%itmegwimble> Yeah game loud
[1:22:41] <+mankeyfigh> MOVE
[1:22:44] <andrei11dr> Woolie still refuses to use his grenades
[1:22:45] <natebud> @Drakenstorm13 yeah the mixing is wonky
[1:22:49] <zayasu> GAME WAY TOO LOUD
[1:22:52] <PsychedelicSnake> I remember the Black Mesa facility in HL1 being the first game I played giving me that sense of wanting to see more of the place before "the game" happens
[1:23:02] <%RioGascar> wait what
[1:23:02] <%Javaa01> So yeah, surface ain't a good idea
[1:23:03] <%itmegwimble> Grenades are for cowards, we goin' in with the shotgun
[1:23:10] <beatie_g> this is the way the game was meant to be experienced
[1:23:11] <%Javaa01> The game quiets down now
[1:23:15] <Amardeux> game not loud enough Kappa
[1:23:15] <%Javaa01> That was the loud bit
[1:23:17] <+queaks> Game wasnt too loud but w/e
[1:23:17] <%RioGascar> perfect
[1:23:18] <%RioGascar> pacing
[1:23:29] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PsychedelicSnake tons of games copyed it because lots of players loved the exploring the world before it went to shit aspect
[1:23:31] <%Javaa01> So you adjusted the volume at the absolute wrong time
[1:23:34] <%RioGascar> you just got used to the HECU
[1:23:35] <natebud> Also adjust the music volume
[1:23:39] <+queaks> Game too quiet
[1:23:43] <%RioGascar> so heres a BIG action setpiece
[1:23:46] <%linSP> Valves games were great because they were thematic tech demos
[1:23:48] <RunningNGunning> Gordon is dummy thicc
[1:23:48] <@Squdnate> Way quiet now @WoolieVersus
[1:23:53] <%Javaa01> Power Armor aint light
[1:23:53] <Dr_Mooose> way too quiet now
[1:23:55] <+kapcommunist> El Gordo
[1:23:55] <@Solidus_113> HEVy
[1:24:00] <beatie_g> Gordon is 200 lbs of pure protien
[1:24:03] <Zeemod155> Can't spell heavy without HEV
[1:24:06] <rubbishbinge> SFX were fine, music was loud
[1:24:08] <%RioGascar> and then when the action set piece is done
[1:24:09] <+mankeyfigh> Way too quiet now
[1:24:10] <Cykron> MY ASS IS HEAVY
[1:24:11] <%RioGascar> time to slow down
[1:24:17] <GoDZooKii> They already said though better netcode was what they are looking into for DBFZ, though. I see no reason they can't implement it.
[1:24:20] <aubrea> its still the source engine lol
[1:24:21] <%Javaa01> That's an EISA card
[1:24:21] <%RioGascar> the mixing is wierd and the music implementation is odd
[1:24:22] <PsychedelicSnake> action loud, otherwise sound will be fine. I'd say boost it back to where it was
[1:24:28] <natebud> Turn down music voume as a start
[1:24:34] <+queaks> Back to how it was. It wasnt too loud before
[1:24:39] <sileo_patronus> This isn't too quiet
[1:24:45] <prdrummer3> Sound is Great!
[1:24:53] <+FadingEmber> @WoolieVersus is there a music slider?

[1:25:14] <%linSP> It’s fine
[1:25:28] <natebud> Voice volume is too quiet, but music volume is way to loud in this game.
[1:25:31] <+Rewrench> it wasnt too loud before. the music kicking in and sirens blaring was great before too
[1:25:37] <%GeneralSCPatton> What assholes

[1:40:39] <+chvmpchange> woolie learns that the crowbar is not great agains enemies past the 3 hour mark
[1:40:42] <natebud> Because this game is easy, he can do that and get away with it
[1:40:51] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @This_is_Marco

[1:41:58] <CrimsonSilver4> Thank god they got rid of the weird blur effect with the 1.0 release
[1:42:00] <DedlokPM> For a second it took me a second
[1:42:03] <cheesedburgers> The Chernobyl noise
[1:42:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> I prefer the Giger counter, which detects phallic bio-terrain
[1:42:12] <thebehatted> isn't it just on their website?
[1:42:15] <+DesertPenguin> The Chernobyl Noise sounds like a great name for a band
[1:42:17] <FuqBoiSlim> hey guys. remember that time Randy Pitchford got the name "Gearbox" from a poker game with GabeN? LUL
[1:42:19] <PsychedelicSnake> Yeah, but at the same time the Valve setup makes it absurdly difficult to start a project
[1:42:20] <+Kiaayo> @itmegwimble he worked at microsoft at the time, and wanted to prove that windows was just as good for games as dos was
[1:42:20] <beatie_g> just do work 4Head
[1:42:21] <%RioGascar> valve is probably the most PUBLIC secretive company
[1:42:24] <StarlitStunner> Stalker flashbacks
[1:42:30] <derap41> Cause no games get done
[1:42:31] <SomersaultJustice> wasn't that handbook just pr?
[1:42:41] <Prevot> this is why they don't make games anymore
[1:42:44] <%RioGascar> the community will EAT anything valve doesnt secure down for any scrap of info
[1:42:48] <Dingo_Eejit> NO! Don't pick those up :[

[1:43:02] <Zeemod155> Pistol = Sniper
[1:43:07] <%Exiliator> I could imagine being pretty bummed if "I was making a game, but my entire team left to make hats..." :(
[1:43:14] <fist_wizard_jay> People arent wearing enough hats
[1:43:19] <derap41> Only the BEST people
[1:43:25] <%RioGascar> the issue is to get any projects off the ground you need an EXECS interest
[1:43:37] <%RioGascar> alyx originally had NO exec interest

[1:55:41] <solid_stro> Metal Gear it.
[1:55:44] <Haarute> hint: the charge is not for damage necessarily.
[1:55:46] <datdemo> use the expplosives to distract it

[1:55:56] <natebud> what makes noise woolie?
[1:55:57] <%GeneralSCPatton> NOT ABOUT SPEED. JUST CROUCHING
[1:56:04] <UnfilteredComic> it matters
[1:56:04] <Blackjackal95> it's patterns

[1:56:15] <@Solidus_113> there's a crouch toggle in options

[1:56:29] <natebud> Turn on always run then hold the sprint button @WoolieVersus
[1:56:30] <Sundaysmiles01> grenades work too
[1:56:37] <Cykron> Crouch
[1:56:45] <+mankeyfigh> Crouch toggle
[1:56:51] <%RioGascar> So the tutorial for the game in hazard course mentioned how the suit activates “stealth mode” when you croucj
[1:56:54] <FrankysDream> @WoolieVersus cant you just remap crouch to like a bumper or something
[1:56:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> Also, ALWAYS RUN
[1:56:57] <%RioGascar> What sense that makes idk

[1:57:34] <+YabbaTroll> is there any way to open the original source menu button?
[1:57:37] <+YabbaTroll> menu*
[1:57:38] <Dingo_Eejit> @zaibatsu_member_333 that might just be at your end

[1:58:07] <+A123yourdead> shut up
[1:58:12] <@Solidus_113> oh nooo. They took it out from the original mod
[1:58:15] <@Solidus_113> NotLikeThis
[1:58:16] <+YabbaTroll> try input
[1:58:23] <KaliasTV> toggle crouch requires a custom config
[1:58:26] <+YabbaTroll> or game
[1:58:31] <natebud> Turn on always run, hold the springt button to walk @WoolieVersus
[1:58:37] <paper1932> custom stuff
[1:58:37] <+YabbaTroll> they def used to have it
[1:58:39] <Haarute> walking worked on the original for this
[1:58:42] <+mankeyfigh> Might’ve taken it out
[1:58:50] <+chvmpchange> bind it to a different button
[1:58:51] <cheesedburgers> Weird thing to take out
[1:58:57] <%GeneralSCPatton> Woolie, not blind? Ha
[1:59:06] <+chvmpchange> bind it to a trigger dude
[1:59:07] <MutedMimic> LuL
[1:59:13] <paper1932> woolie may in fact have the ability to see
[1:59:14] <natebud> figure it out woolie
[1:59:16] <+zaibatsu_member_333> 100% its on my side of things
[1:59:21] <+Flunkorg> ITs not just speed woolie, you need to distract it with the bombs
[1:59:23] <cheesedburgers> Source’d
[1:59:25] <Haarute> think about why they gave you the remote explosive charge.
[1:59:32] <solid_stro> Woolie will figure it out... eventually.
[1:59:32] <+zaibatsu_member_333> Damn you Montral construction
[1:59:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> @paper1932 Not quite convinced of that
[1:59:35] <sonofthedeepsouth> THE NEETS WILL INHERIT THE EARTH
[1:59:48] <rubbishbinge> explosives make sounds
[1:59:50] <+zaibatsu_member_333> *shakes fist at cloud*
[1:59:52] <evil_doru> distract it by throwing grenades at LOWER levels, then destroy woodboards
[1:59:57] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @sonofthedeepsouth
[1:59:57] <bleugh> the keyboard woolie... use the keyboard
[1:59:58] <natebud> Don't just tell himt he answer
[1:59:59] <+mankeyfigh> Man games were not intuitive back in the day
[2:00:05] <@Solidus_113> ladders only have one speed
[2:00:12] <+zaibatsu_member_333> "Crouch on Ladder"
[2:00:15] <%Ecchigun> JUMP + CROUCH
[2:00:16] <+zaibatsu_member_333> What a Trill
[2:00:25] <Sundaysmiles01> Ladders make noise regardless of how fast you move
[2:00:25] <+chvmpchange> hmm perhaps the game was designed for a keyboard
[2:00:28] <%Ecchigun> coming back to neutral LUL
[2:00:29] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:00:31] <CrimsonSilver4> Actually on my playthrough the guard that comes up to shoot the monster glitched out and became invincible, even after firing the rocket
[2:00:36] <sonofthedeepsouth> just do a quater circle back dash woolie
[2:00:37] <@Solidus_113> It's a CFG file modification
[2:00:40] <+Flunkorg> @natebud You might enjoy watching someone do no progress for a few hours but most of us aren't
[2:00:40] <+gfbagel> Electric Wind Ladder Fist
[2:00:40] <@Solidus_113> I can send you a link
[2:00:46] <CrimsonSilver4> Made thigns easier for me
[2:00:50] <Haarute> woolie there's an easier gameplay solution than editing a cfg
[2:00:51] <natebud> Turn always run on, and hold the sprint button to walk @WoolieVersus
[2:01:02] <peachteagaming> auto crouch in the options menu
[2:01:20] <Sundaysmiles01> Woolie try throwing a grenade/satchel charge and see how long it holds its attention
[2:01:21] <+mankeyfigh> It ain’t there
[2:01:22] <@Solidus_113> I sent it to Woolie on Twitter
[2:01:38] <Haarute> there's a reason for the game to give you explosives just now
[2:01:38] <+YabbaTroll> bind stick1 t_duck in console may work
[2:01:40] <evil_doru> distract it by throwing grenades at LOWER levels, then destroy woodboards
[2:01:45] <sonofthedeepsouth> really makes you think
[2:01:50] <+YabbaTroll> its either duck1 or t_duck
[2:01:56] <%linSP> source ladders woolieWUT
[2:02:07] <Dingo_Eejit> ???
[2:02:08] <sonofthedeepsouth> crouch
[2:02:10] <+Flunkorg> ???
[2:02:16] <+tuchpi> LUL
[2:02:23] <natebud> Woolie, there is an aspect of this encounter that you are missing entirely
[2:02:30] <Zooperton> jermaOneguy
[2:02:33] <+Flunkorg> Woolie, its about making noise
[2:02:34] <+kapcommunist> i said crip walking actually LUL
[2:02:34] <Sundaysmiles01> or throw the grenades at the wooden planks at the doorways to predestroy them, then just run distraction with other bombs
[2:02:36] <peachteagaming> we will remember this forever
[2:02:37] <Haarute> i remember walking working on the original, not sure if it works on this one ALSO there's a puzzle you aren't figuring out
[2:02:44] <+D00msDayDan> how is he reading everything in chat but the stuff about the demo charge
[2:02:45] <@Solidus_113> There was a bug before 1.0 where the crouch wasn't quiet enough, but I think it's fixed now
[2:02:47] <natebud> grenades make sound
[2:02:48] <+sir_louis> Other things can make sound
[2:02:51] <+tuchpi> they give you a shelf of explosives LUL
[2:02:54] <+Exyoh> You're on the right track with the crouching, but there's more to it
[2:03:02] <+Nod80> grenades use a lot of grenades
[2:03:07] <+mankeyfigh> I mean the demo charge thing isn’t intuitive
[2:03:08] <MisterVantes> Just throw nades and sprint to the ladder @WoolieVersus
[2:03:09] <%GeneralSCPatton> You have grenades and demo satchels, which are quite loud
[2:03:15] <peachteagaming> distract with grenades
[2:03:17] <+mankeyfigh> But that should work
[2:03:17] <%kyh9> Throw junk to make sounds
[2:03:19] <%linSP> You can sneak
[2:03:20] <Amardeux> use grenades before goin down loadders
[2:03:20] <Haarute> @WoolieVersus they just gave you remote explosive charge. hint: it's not for damage.
[2:03:23] <Sundaysmiles01> IGNORE THE CROUCH, use the GRENADES
[2:03:24] <Amardeux> *ladders

[2:03:49] <+Nod80> blow the hell out of the boards
[2:03:49] <+kapcommunist> sick shirt!
[2:03:52] <sonofthedeepsouth> Woolie is a blood
[2:03:52] <+aishman> What section is this?
[2:03:54] <Dingo_Eejit> then do it, literally USE IT-uh
[2:03:55] <blaggablag> yeah you just nade and sprint
[2:03:56] <+YabbaTroll> "bind STICK1 toggle_duck" in the console should work @WoolieVersus
[2:04:03] <+aishman> Cause I'm half way past the game so I could help as well
[2:04:05] <kakdela7> is this about the tentacle monster?
[2:04:07] <+YabbaTroll> without a mod
[2:04:07] <@Solidus_113> This monster is still a sore spot in Half Life 1
[2:04:09] <oyyzzo> script it ^^
[2:04:09] <evil_doru> not an option, firepower ftw
[2:04:14] <+aishman> OH are we talking about the tentacles?
[2:04:15] <+queaks> @WoolieVersus I use grenades to open up the wooded barriers, then another grenade somewhere else to distract it
[2:04:16] <cheesedburgers> Couldn’t you force it into the hole for a few seconds
[2:04:19] <+that_Mojo_Izakku> yeah, it's not a matter of woolie missing anything, he wants toggle crouch
[2:04:22] <cheesedburgers> Or am I misremembering
[2:04:28] <+that_Mojo_Izakku> it's just that
[2:04:28] <sonofthedeepsouth> woolieYE_RB woolieYE_RB woolieYE_RB woolieYE_RB woolieYE_RB woolieYE_RB
[2:04:30] <@Solidus_113> It's a code change, not a steam workshop mod
[2:04:37] <natebud> @WoolieVersus if you turn on always run, the sprint button becomes 'walk', it's just as good as crouch and it's much more comfortable than holding the stick in
[2:04:37] <+chvmpchange> the game not having toggle crouch is bizarre
[2:04:39] <evil_doru> i remember u set it on fire
[2:04:44] <peachteagaming> woolie will now learn to use his pinkie
[2:04:45] <evil_doru> its been 12= years
[2:04:51] <+aishman> @cheesedburgers The way to go past it is crouching, using explosives like mines and grenades to distract it
[2:05:02] <+that_Mojo_Izakku> it is weird if they removed an option for toggle crouch tbh
[2:05:24] <@Solidus_113> hacker time
[2:05:27] <+chvmpchange> i mean its a pretty standard fps feature
[2:05:29] <%Exiliator> Give Reggie a keyboard and have im press ctrl when you need to crouch Kappa

[2:31:10] <+Archphronimos> that's their thing...
[2:31:13] <derap41> Killing Floor 2
[2:31:15] <+bokutachi_san> yes
[2:31:16] <+YabbaTroll> Tarkov but not like that
[2:31:16] <cheesedburgers> Fuckin far cry 2
[2:31:18] <@Solidus_113> there are a bunch of games where reloading a completely empty mag takes a bit longer than one with bullets still in it
[2:31:19] <Amardeux> feed the barnacles
[2:31:20] <Amardeux> LUL
[2:31:21] <@Solidus_113> also yes Reggie
[2:31:21] <dukenux> Fallout has "Faster reload" perk
[2:31:21] <+D00msDayDan> tons of games have a longer reload animation if you reload from empty vs some ammo left in the mag
[2:31:24] <%Exiliator> I always liked New Vegas reload fuck ups
[2:31:25] <CookieDoughFK> Black on the PS2 has 3 different reload types
[2:31:25] <+unclekulikov> I think medal of honor pacific had variable speed based on how far you were along on the campaign.
[2:31:26] <+kapcommunist> enter the gungeon has a speciial gun like that too
[2:31:41] <%RioGascar> its a gun that looks like the gears gun too
[2:31:44] <natebud> @kapcommunist And the upgrade is a literal Gear of War
[2:31:45] <dukenux> yep, that's GoW
[2:31:46] <derap41> Reloading with a bullet in the chamber vs reloading when empty is a big one
[2:31:47] <%RioGascar> has a chainsaw attachment too
[2:31:47] <NotHereToStream> active reload
[2:31:50] <SubjectX07x> There are also many games that operate off of the system where if you fully empty the gun it takes a little longer as you have to charge the charging handle, pump the shotty or rack the slide.
[2:31:53] <%GeneralSCPatton> Mercenary Kings is all about that
[2:31:56] <dukenux> i relly liked that, more shooties should have that
[2:31:57] <NWannabe> ?? how old is unist?
[2:32:13] <This_is_Marco> gungeon has the passive that works for all guns
[2:32:16] <derap41> @SubjectX07x yeah exactly it makes a big diffirence
[2:32:19] <@Solidus_113> green button
[2:32:22] <Amardeux> the button is right there BibleThump
[2:32:23] <This_is_Marco> unless were talking about RAD GUN
[2:32:24] <+sir_louis> I Love the reload!
[2:32:25] <%GeneralSCPatton> And Nioh's Ki Pulse is just an active reload on your Stamina
[2:32:26] <+sambone_z> active reloads or something like that I lovethat shit too
[2:32:36] <FuqBoiSlim> Under night came out in 2012

[2:33:13] <%GeneralSCPatton> Can you make that?
[2:33:17] <%Louie_Salmon> @solid_stro In his own way
[2:33:17] <SubjectX07x> Hell Escape From Tarkov has a difference in reloads where if you double tap R instead of taking out the mag, slipping it back into your vest then loading a fresh mag, your character just yeets the mag onto the floor and loads a new one. @derap41
[2:33:17] <natebud> Keep that in mind, Woolie. That is a thing later
[2:33:18] <NWannabe> Ok...is gun girl in UNIST newer thab gears @FuqBoiSlim ?
[2:33:24] <xeros720> the Woolie Story:"It Might've Been Cool"
[2:33:27] <heartlesshealer> dogs
[2:33:27] <%RioGascar> VR automatically has variable reload speed
[2:33:29] <%RioGascar> its fun
[2:33:34] <+YabbaTroll> @Ecchigun its counterbalanced by you fumbling on the floor looking for the 7ni that popped out of your mosin
[2:33:36] <%RioGascar> load a revolver under fire
[2:33:42] <%RioGascar> turns out its very hard
[2:33:42] <NotHereToStream> modern warfare has some nice reloads
[2:33:43] <heartlesshealer> event flags are fun
[2:33:57] <%Ecchigun> @YabbaTroll haha, true
[2:34:00] <+mankeyfigh> The LP tax for platforming is MUCH STRONGER

[2:48:05] <This_is_Marco> Vortigaunt FeelsGoodMan
[2:48:06] <derap41> Woolie they're probably freaking out as much as you
[2:48:08] <+doc_ock_rokc> We need to get hl2 in woolie's hand
[2:48:09] <FuqBoiSlim> That's a whole ass space invader

[2:48:42] <PsychedelicSnake> @WoolieVersus Pay attention to what they are wearing next time you run into one
[2:48:43] <+tuchpi> content spoilers PogChamp
[2:48:44] <@Solidus_113> I think they're only named in HL2
[2:48:46] <%RioGascar> humans just named them that
[2:48:46] <Nested_Dreams> In HL2 LuL
[2:48:47] <natebud> It will not give you that information
[2:48:48] <+taggerung403> @DedlokPM yamero
[2:48:59] <%RioGascar> they apparently call themselves something else
[2:49:02] <derap41> They're like Abe from Abe's Odyssey
[2:49:05] <dukenux> Vorts play a bigger role as a faction in Half-Life 2
[2:49:05] <Sundaysmiles01> They're enslaved aliens Woolie
[2:49:07] <%RioGascar> but humans call em vorts or vortigaunts
[2:49:11] <heartlesshealer> @DedlokPM COULD. A reliable method of interspecies communication would still have to be established

[2:49:49] <%ghostattack_1998> Some honey-baked Headcrab
[2:49:50] <natebud> They only eat live headcrabs apparently
[2:49:55] <rubbishbinge> Reggie's palate is cleansed of ethnic food groups
[2:49:56] <FuqBoiSlim> "I dont wanna catch the 'Rona"

[2:53:38] <derap41> Bide is the way
[2:53:43] <dukenux> ARE THEY?
[2:53:45] <+sadiebubs> I already knew about the bidet
[2:53:46] <peachy996> Yersh nah
[2:53:48] <This_is_Marco> bidet is the way PogChamp
[2:53:49] <natebud> but it fires underwater at least @derap41
[2:53:50] <+sadiebubs> For yeaaarss
[2:53:52] <+gildedangel> aaah okay thanks @solidus_113
[2:53:57] <Djinnazz> @zayasu define ‘can’t reach’?
[2:54:13] <+sadiebubs> "bidets. They're just better"
[2:54:15] <+tuchpi> Kreygasm
[2:54:16] <Prevot> Americans will never reach that truth
[2:54:22] <derap41> @natebud so does like every closed bolt pistol
[2:54:27] <Elsewize> wth is a bidet?
[2:54:34] <+doc_ock_rokc> 4-5 a day
[2:54:36] <TheA1ternative> I just wipe and then shower
[2:54:40] <%Binary_Fireball> @WoolieVersus so like how is there not like water everywhere?
[2:54:45] <Amardeux> man i miss Japanese Toilets BibleThump
[2:54:46] <niddron> a lot dude
[2:54:50] <+sadiebubs> I think a lot of people are too afraid it's gay to spray your butthole
[2:54:53] <%Exiliator> @Elsewize an ass-shower
[2:54:53] <+tuchpi> DansGame
[2:54:55] <zayasu> @Djinnazz smol hands Kappa nah hes playing on controller and said his keyboard is too far away or something
[2:54:57] <derap41> Vanguard comes first Woolie
[2:54:58] <rysku> that's fair
[2:55:02] <+chaumiester> I do 2 sheet every trip now to conserve
[2:55:04] <Elsewize> Sounds horrifying.
[2:55:04] <+zaibatsu_member_333> you can just buy a JapaNESS tOLITE
[2:55:06] <derap41> RearGuard is last
[2:55:06] <+lethallunacyx> That's based on each experience for me
[2:55:12] <dukenux> im still wiping my butt even if i get a bidet
[2:55:15] <+zaibatsu_member_333> FROME hOME dEPO EVEN..
[2:55:15] <Dingo_Eejit> America 140 roll per person per year - France 70
[2:55:16] <@Solidus_113> Bidet railguns
[2:55:19] <RushUnplugged> "fellas is it gay to wash yo ass" SMH
[2:55:20] <+lethallunacyx> sometimes it's 4 sometimes it's 20
[2:55:23] <dukenux> wet butthole doesnt sound fun
[2:55:32] <heartlesshealer> ignore progress
[2:55:33] <rysku> yeah but bidet takes more time
[2:55:37] <niddron> if you dip some water on it, that's special forces
[2:55:40] <@Solidus_113> down the elevator shaft
[2:55:43] <PsychedelicSnake> I trust my own shit. I don't trust bird shit
[2:55:49] <SomersaultJustice> so spit in the paper and wipe yourself, got it
[2:55:49] <heartlesshealer> GOODBYE PROGRESS
[2:55:50] <Elsewize> But like, you have to still wipe afterward, no?
[2:55:54] <%Binary_Fireball> are there bidets in public toilets?
[2:55:58] <Sundaysmiles01> One up, One Down and One to Polish
[2:56:04] <+sadiebubs> yeah, just 1 wipe to dry off
[2:56:13] <@Solidus_113> there's platforms
[2:56:16] <natebud> @derap41 glock has a specific design to make it fire better and accurately underwater though.
[2:56:20] <Amardeux> down into the shaft LUL
[2:56:21] <Dingo_Eejit> plus my asshole isn't on my face where people can see or smell it
[2:56:26] <FrankysDream> two big holes in the floor
[2:56:38] <dukenux> @Elsewize i always assumed so. unless people use bidets like they use Karcher devices. make the sheer water pressure wipe it all clean
[2:56:38] <+D00msDayDan> woolie's arch nemesis, ladders
[2:56:39] <+zaibatsu_member_333> Dry wipe 1st then follow up with soap an water wipes VoHiYo
[2:56:41] <heartlesshealer> it's fine, Reggie has eyes

[2:56:53] <zayasu> monkaS
[2:56:58] <Cykron> Woolie is doing a sponsorship monologue
[2:57:05] <derap41> @natebud Sure but most pistols can already do that so having it specifically made to do that what's the point
[2:57:08] <dukenux> Wa'ah
[2:57:08] <Zooperton> grip it with your cheeks to keep your hands on your gun
[2:57:29] <derap41> Who spits in a fight
[2:57:31] <%RioGascar> blew into GIBS
[2:57:36] <FuqBoiSlim> HE DONT MISSSS
[2:57:44] <natebud> @derap41 I'm saying that's why valve chose it. There's only two guns that work underwater in this game
[2:57:48] <NotHereToStream> yes get fucked
[2:57:54] <+zaibatsu_member_333> Darlington drop your SHIELD!
[2:58:10] <+YabbaTroll> hall wug?

[2:58:44] <derap41> @natebud I was talking more real life not game design reasons
[2:58:56] <derap41> Also I wouldn't trust valve with guns
[2:58:59] <@Solidus_113> nice
[2:59:03] <Katorskay> buster wolf
[2:59:05] <%Exiliator> Hes fighting the crab
[2:59:13] <derap41> They have a SPAS-12 franchi that fires two shots like wtf
[2:59:28] <+mankeyfigh> BUSTA WOLF
[2:59:29] <natebud> They read the wikipedia page for glocks at least
[2:59:36] <dukenux> watch it
[2:59:36] <PsychedelicSnake> The Mist is raw
[2:59:37] <derap41> Also MP5 with a grenade launcher I mean its cool but good luck using that in reality
[2:59:38] <@Solidus_113> You'll want to save a couple times in this room
[2:59:41] <Dr_Mooose> bad times the movie
[2:59:47] <+zaibatsu_member_333> She blinded me with Science!
[2:59:56] <%RioGascar> marc laidlaw is VERY inspired by dark shit
[3:00:01] <dukenux> Also: Die Hard
[3:00:13] <solid_stro> Bad ending the movie
[3:00:18] <%RioGascar> see: half life 2's beta
[3:00:20] <peachy996> Outer Limits had a great intro
[3:00:23] <%RioGascar> where it was too dark
[3:00:38] <heartlesshealer> So Reggie, about The Borderland?
[3:00:39] <This_is_Marco> Marc Laidlaw is the shit, god Valve could have done some great stuff
[3:00:40] <Zooperton> hl2's beta was rad
[3:01:00] <dukenux> HL2 changed "dark" to "bleak"
[3:01:02] <%RioGascar> marc came back for consulting on alyx
[3:01:07] <dukenux> until Ravenholm at least
[3:01:17] <%RioGascar> also it was written by the portal 2 team
[3:01:24] <%RioGascar> so i have high hopes for its story
[3:01:37] <natebud> door stuck
[3:01:46] <Dingo_Eejit> Come again?
[3:01:53] <solid_stro> Eventually Woolie’s FPS will lead him to screaming at 12 year olds for noob tubing. We’ll get there.
[3:02:04] <This_is_Marco> @RioGascar oh thats cool, I figured he had a bad experience with Valve when he left
[3:02:11] <@Solidus_113> you want to go back down
[3:02:17] <%RioGascar> they addressed that in the AMA
[3:02:24] <%RioGascar> he and valve left on good terms
[3:02:31] <derap41> Chirality broken
[3:02:35] <+zaibatsu_member_333> Regies sppoky
[3:02:38] <This_is_Marco> Ill have to look at that
[3:02:41] <derap41> Kojima You hack
[3:02:41] <+zaibatsu_member_333> :o
[3:02:45] <+zaibatsu_member_333> :0
[3:02:57] <%Exiliator> If I wanted to go to another dimension, I would just pick a fight with Vegeta or something
[3:03:10] <@Solidus_113> there's a puzzle here
[3:03:23] <@Solidus_113> SAVE NOW
[3:03:32] <%linSP> you look away from the mirror but your reflection continues to stare at you
[3:03:35] <%RioGascar> it auto saves i believe solid
[3:03:37] <heartlesshealer> SAVE
[3:03:40] <dukenux> And Die Hard
[3:03:40] <lotharrio> Outer Limits had a lot of morals tacked onto the end of their neat sci fi stories.
[3:03:40] <natebud> he quicksaved earlier

[3:05:51] <%Exiliator> because of the coke nail?
[3:05:51] <dukenux> LUL
[3:05:52] <solid_stro> The amount of air pressure to lift a fully grown man

[3:25:23] <Ether101_Prime> Where's the DOOM Slayer when you need him.
[3:25:23] <Elsewize> "I heard you was talkin' crap ovah heyah."
[3:25:24] <derap41> take a good look at these guys
[3:25:31] <@Solidus_113> you want headshots
[3:25:32] <fangovafang> 😳
[3:25:33] <PsychedelicSnake> Why is the magnum so weak
[3:25:34] <+Mr_Pylon> headshotter
[3:25:35] <+Zanco23> Sure...
[3:25:36] <%jepupu> It's a sniper
[3:25:39] <natebud> takes two like the shotgun.
[3:25:41] <HorribleHog> you want to *hit* them
[3:25:41] <%RioGascar> headshot is insta kill
[3:25:43] <%Javaa01> Revolver is for headshots
[3:25:49] <Them00n> It seems weaker than I remember.
[3:25:51] <+doc_ock_rokc> @Ether101_Prime Doomslayer doesn't care unless its a demon
[3:25:51] <Kraahka> You need to actually aim
[3:25:53] <+aishman> It's great...for a headshot
[3:25:53] <Quent0nius> this has "Doomslayer needed" all over it
[3:25:59] <+chiluzza> headshot is insta killl
[3:26:00] <UnfilteredComic> Magnum is stronger in HL2
[3:26:01] <ripoffproductionsllc> 1 for headshot, 2 for normal
[3:26:01] <%linSP> Gotta high noon
[3:26:04] <dukenux> did they nerf Magnum? that'd suck
[3:26:05] <solid_stro> Head.... shot...
[3:26:05] <Amardeux> yaeh you gotta headshot
[3:26:09] <Djinnazz> You missed a lot of those
[3:26:11] <derap41> Insta GIB or nothing in Source games
[3:26:13] <+mankeyfigh> Headshot
[3:26:15] <MattDemers> HL2 headshot is great
[3:26:16] <mobiusnightshade> It's not a hand-cannon.
[3:26:18] <%Javaa01> The revolver is perfectly accurate, and it's for headshots ONLY
[3:26:19] <Kraahka> It's still a two shot for most enemies
[3:26:21] <MattDemers> Er HL 2 Magnum is great
[3:26:21] <Zeemod155> They're all hitscan
[3:26:29] <Cykron> You need to headshot with the magnum
[3:26:30] <Amardeux> stars? i'll show you stars LUL
[3:26:35] <ripoffproductionsllc> there was a room up above the l;ader
[3:26:37] <@Solidus_113> rocket is the only projectile
[3:26:40] <%RioGascar> okay so woolie go back
[3:26:45] <Haarute> diference is that this is a first person shooter, you gotta aim.

[3:29:53] <Amardeux> LUL
[3:29:58] <%Javaa01> The turrets are placed BY the military, of course they don't shoot military personnel

[3:30:07] <natebud> Woolie just stand still and shoot, they can't kill you
[3:30:17] <dukenux> Isn't it just the same AI as Combine mooks?
[3:30:17] <heartlesshealer> turrets were pre-soldier invasion
[3:30:17] <UnfilteredComic> they do, thats why it doesnt shoot them
[3:30:22] <ripoffproductionsllc> no, they were military
[3:30:23] <+FanServ> there are facility turrets but also soldier turrets
[3:30:25] <solid_stro> Their eyesight is based on movement
[3:30:26] <derap41> Sourced
[3:30:26] <jackoftheflames> @WoolieVersus That turret was theirs, hence why it didn't shoot them

[3:30:44] <Ahk_90> physics doing their bullshit
[3:30:45] <%RioGascar> the facility ones are black mesa
[3:30:49] <ripoffproductionsllc> if it's BM facility turret it will be biult into the wall/cetaling/floor
[3:30:52] <natebud> @UnfilteredComic they have a lot of trouble, it's crazy
[3:30:55] <derap41> @valachi Why Would They have armed guards
[3:31:00] <UnfilteredComic> Use hotkeys 1-9
[3:31:00] <jackoftheflames> Try lift up a turret next time
[3:31:08] <HorribleHog> the fact that there are facility turrets but only in that one section bothers me
[3:31:12] <jackoftheflames> and put it towards the soldiers. fun time
[3:31:12] <valachi> @derap41 To make those fucking NERDS know their place
[3:31:13] <Them00n> We're not even close to done with weapons either.
[3:31:14] <+xx123manxx> They should really have HL2 Console Weapon Wheel
[3:31:19] <dukenux> is there a "Q" key equivalent on a gamepad?
[3:31:28] <natebud> Woolie still has about 5 more weapons to acquire, The weapon switching will be glorious

[3:45:56] <PsychedelicSnake> @WoolieVersus The grunts are pretty smart, even in OG Half-Life 1. They will lay traps and ambushes for you, and love to do flanking
[3:45:57] <%Javaa01> They have a flanking route to those platforms
[3:45:57] <derap41> Why Do Merchs Suddenly appear

[3:56:16] <+xx123manxx> ehh like 50 or so
[3:56:30] <lotharrio> Gordon Freeman has been killing since he was in highschool.
[3:56:30] <+xx123manxx> give or take
[3:56:32] <gade177> Woolie get's motion sickness and yet he moves so much.
[3:56:33] <Zeemod155> RIP ranged weapons
[3:56:44] <natebud> like 35
[3:56:48] <derap41> Murder Man Gordon
[3:56:55] <%RioGascar> he gets a specfic type of motion sickness
[3:57:00] <%jepupu> Shotgun is the best weapon on controller, since lots of others take preceision aim
[3:57:02] <+doc_ock_rokc> an MIT bookworm has managed to kill at least 40 elite trained soldiers
[3:57:03] <%Exiliator> The DOOM has imprinted itself too hard into Woolie
[3:57:07] <Haarute> Gordon the Berserker
[3:57:15] <dukenux> wooliePsycho
[3:57:19] <DedlokPM> Wait... This whole Jack in a box thing just made me realize something... Metal Gear Solid 3... They said Big Boss's "name" is Jack. And what is a common thing that you can hide in the metal gear games? A BOX
[3:57:23] <natebud> you are wrong
[3:57:23] <fangovafang> 🎶weee reeaaddy🎶
[3:57:26] <Djinnazz> Kinda??
[3:57:26] <derap41> He likes the Gibblets
[3:57:29] <+tuchpi> dont you get controller aim assist?
[3:57:30] <DedlokPM> SO BIG BOSS IS A JACK IN A BOX
[3:57:35] <+PapermanXD> grappler route
[3:57:36] <%linSP> Gordon played too much doom
[3:57:39] <unit24> yeah woolie needs to mess with the sensitivity
[3:57:40] <%RioGascar> @DedlokPM you are in time out now
[3:57:42] <%RioGascar> bad
[3:57:47] <+PapermanXD> gotta get in there
[3:57:49] <unit24> the acceleration on source games is pure garbage
[3:57:55] <unit24> first it moves too slow, then it moves too fast
[3:57:58] <+doc_ock_rokc> @DedlokPM That makes Metal gear....So much better
[3:58:05] <%RioGascar> does it
[3:58:08] <yeeyeyee> isn't big boss's name john
[3:58:10] <Dr_Mooose> yes
[3:58:13] <DedlokPM> It does
[3:58:14] <%RioGascar> cause thats just kojimas PUN GAME AGAIN
[3:58:18] <natebud> i think its off by default @unit24
[3:58:28] <+xx123manxx> Every fuckin' console shooter either has shit low sens or shit ass acceleration I can't stand it
[3:58:38] <%linSP> Jack was raiden wasn’t he
[3:58:43] <yeeyeyee> big boss is john, raiden is jack, and solid snake is david
[3:58:45] <ripoffproductionsllc> there was a room you missed backby the ladder by "Big BIO"
[3:58:46] <+PapermanXD> tasty rads
[3:58:46] <+doc_ock_rokc> @linSP yes he is
[3:58:54] <+Zanco23> Help?
[3:58:58] <Sundaysmiles01> Is woolie using a controller or keyboard and mouse for this playthrough?
[3:59:00] <natebud> Woolie never even talked to the tram guy
[3:59:02] <+doc_ock_rokc> Thats Rad
[3:59:03] <unit24> what I mean is that woolie's aim starts slow and then immediately speeds up when he moves the stick, it's how it was on the console versions of orange box as well
[3:59:06] <zenith0111> My favorite Kojima pun is Jack the Ripper because it meant he killed people caleb63
[3:59:07] <+xx123manxx> Controller
[3:59:13] <Sundaysmiles01> ....ah
[3:59:14] <+aceleapc> everyone knows when you're exposed to radiation you see film grain
[3:59:15] <derap41> @Sundaysmiles01 Controller like a mad man
[3:59:19] <Sundaysmiles01> I see why his aim sucks
[3:59:27] <DedlokPM> @linSP I double checked by googling before hand. Jack is both Big Boss' AND Raiden's "Name"
[3:59:37] <natebud> just stand still and shoot
[3:59:38] <+xx123manxx> next time I won't miss
[3:59:44] <Kraahka> It is a controller, hence the clumsy aim
[3:59:47] <%Javaa01> Well thankfully there is health around
[3:59:51] <Dingo_Eejit> @xx123manxx - Titanfall2 bro, they cared about stick sens/acc

[4:02:01] <%RioGascar> uh
[4:02:04] <%RioGascar> did guard not spawn?
[4:02:05] <Haarute> he sequence broke it probably lmao
[4:02:09] <%Javaa01> Yeah, no Barney because he skipped coming to here before fixing the power
[4:02:09] <shamuzu> uh oh...
[4:02:10] <%RioGascar> uh oh
[4:02:13] <ripoffproductionsllc> oh no...
[4:02:14] <+xx123manxx> he just... doesn't exist if you miss him the 1st time?
[4:02:16] <%RioGascar> he might be unable to complete now
[4:02:16] <dukenux> wait, where's the guy?
[4:02:22] <natebud> Big sequence break
[4:02:31] <dukenux> oh nooooo
[4:02:35] <%Exiliator> Maybe hes friendly :)
[4:02:36] <%RioGascar> might
[4:02:36] <+doc_ock_rokc> @xx123manxx yeeeeap
[4:02:37] <derap41> Eh this might be ba
[4:02:38] <ripoffproductionsllc> did iot brake becouse he didn't see him before starting the power?
[4:02:39] <derap41> d
[4:02:40] <Dr_Mooose> uh ok
[4:02:40] <unit24> did the chapter break?
[4:02:43] <Haarute> i'd assume he can do it, he just doesn't know -what- to do
[4:02:44] <%Javaa01> @dukenux Barney doesn't show up unless you come here before fixing the power
[4:02:47] <natebud> There was a guy to talk to in here before
[4:02:47] <%SilvaChariot0133> lytALRIGHT
[4:02:52] <ripoffproductionsllc> does he need tio restart the chapter?
[4:02:59] <%RioGascar> i dont think so
[4:03:00] <@Solidus_113> he didn't come in here the first time before power
[4:03:05] <natebud> The walkway never fell too
[4:03:06] <dukenux> @Javaa01 that's weird, but atleast the lp isn't broken
[4:03:12] <%RioGascar> he might be screwed
[4:03:18] <+xx123manxx> FIYAHH
[4:03:20] <%RioGascar> since the guard activates the switch
[4:03:22] <%Exiliator> ouch
[4:03:28] <dukenux> @WoolieVersus apparently the lps not broken yet, you trigger the thing later
[4:03:28] <%SilvaChariot0133> LUL
[4:03:30] <AppleBerryKitty> F
[4:03:31] <NotHereToStream> ass completely cooked
[4:03:31] <Zeemod155> WHY?
[4:03:32] <%Javaa01> @dukenux It worked like this in HL1 original as well
[4:03:36] <+BionoidLCR> yea run in that corner woolz
[4:03:36] <@Solidus_113> you were going the right way
[4:03:36] <natebud> I hope he appears to operate the turnstyle
[4:03:37] <Haarute> second try
[4:03:38] <fangovafang> ...
[4:03:39] <UnfilteredComic> YOu wanted that ladder
[4:03:40] <%RioGascar> looking up it doesnt seem broken
[4:03:42] <%KingOfTheSpaceWasp> what the hell woolie
[4:03:44] <RiverBirch> LOWER YOUR SHIELD
[4:03:45] <%zombieghost1337> lmao this is the one that always gets new players @WoolieVersus
[4:03:45] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> slizzed
[4:03:46] <PsychedelicSnake> It's fine
[4:03:47] <UnfilteredComic> Nah youre good
[4:03:51] <Haarute> i'm pretty sure he can do it
[4:03:52] <derap41> There is meant to be a guy in this room
[4:03:58] <+doc_ock_rokc> you just missed a character nothing more
[4:03:58] <derap41> Might still worjk
[4:03:59] <PsychedelicSnake> You just missed a character. It's fine
[4:04:00] <+tuchpi> Kappa
[4:04:01] <ripoffproductionsllc> no that guy is in BM
[4:04:02] <+Zanco23> No the guard was just an optional conversation, it doesn't effect the story.
[4:04:03] <%Javaa01> Nope, the scene is in Black Mesa as well
[4:04:07] <%Javaa01> But you skipped it
[4:04:07] <@Solidus_113> It's a small detail, nothing broken
[4:04:14] <natebud> That guy is in black mesa, he never spawned
[4:04:15] <+xx123manxx> BHOP on controller Kappa
[4:04:21] <%RioGascar> the reason we said is cause the guard DIES in this and the game DOES trigger a fail state
[4:04:30] <Dr_Mooose> just like a dog
[4:04:33] <%Javaa01> You need to fix the power tho
[4:04:38] <+BionoidLCR> fix the power woolz

[4:08:17] <%RioGascar> alright now hoping black mesa knows how to just
[4:08:23] <%RioGascar> back up top
[4:08:37] <%RioGascar> the guard is supposed to rotate it for you
[4:08:37] <ripoffproductionsllc> there are multiple speeds
[4:08:38] <UnfilteredComic> It already did it
[4:08:38] <dukenux> Control room
[4:08:41] <+Zanco23> Oh, I think this is where the guy was supposed to turn it.
[4:08:42] <dukenux> oh neat
[4:08:43] <@Solidus_113> big speed
[4:08:46] <%Javaa01> You can crank the speed
[4:08:47] <%RioGascar> heyyyyy sequence not broke
[4:08:49] <unit24> speed that shit up

[4:12:14] <unit24> on a rail uncut is the shit and I am so disappointed they didn't officially incorporate it

[4:12:28] <AppleBerryKitty> chat! steam version have the uncut unarail?
[4:12:30] <+Zanco23> @Javaa01 But Xen though...
[4:12:31] <%Exiliator> DEVIL STREAM
[4:12:31] <%Javaa01> This On a Rail has nearly nothing to do with the original On a Rail
[4:12:35] <dukenux> or so they say, i didn't hate it personally
[4:12:35] <DedlokPM> @BionoidLCR 1) you had not said that when I started typing it 2) you must make a lot of friends with an attitude like that
[4:12:41] <%RioGascar> you can download the original version
[4:12:42] <ripoffproductionsllc> saddly shortening OAR gives the soldiers less waight due to having less fights with them
[4:12:49] <%RioGascar> which is made by a black mesa dev
[4:12:49] <natebud> I like original On A Rail. The hate it gets is exagerrated
[4:12:50] <derap41> I'm On a rail
[4:12:52] <%Javaa01> Xen isn't an adjustment, Xen is a completely new thing
[4:12:57] <+queaks> Those reflections are strangely impressive
[4:13:02] <derap41> Everybody look at me cause I'm standing on a rail
[4:13:04] <natebud> Xen has TREES now
[4:13:06] <dellis80> Doom is good....but overrated
[4:13:06] <%Exiliator> Woolie has been streaming for: PIE!

[4:13:18] <FuqBoiSlim> this water is okay looking. we need the water rater from Miiverse to give us the accurate rating tho
[4:13:22] <natebud> @Them00n nah
[4:13:22] <derap41> Big cracks
[4:13:26] <%Javaa01> The original On a Rail maze isn't great
[4:13:27] <ripoffproductionsllc> we done or just a brake?
[4:13:30] <zamzoph> BELLY
[4:13:31] <+BionoidLCR> @DedlokPM if you read the message at all you would see that i did i said def wise they called them all barney but a theres one whos name is so get bent
[4:13:33] <@Solidus_113> big progress
[4:13:33] <%linSP> Shoot I have to now play this and the original just so I can listen to both scores
[4:13:44] <%Javaa01> But yeah, you're now coming up on the halfway point of Black Mesa
[4:13:49] <+imadoc91> Yo, did I come in at the beginning or at the end?
[4:13:50] <%RioGascar> i like kelly bailey's score a lot
[4:13:51] <%Javaa01> Not quite there YET, but after this
[4:13:53] <+Zanco23> Make sure Woolie gets MMod for Half-Life 2, it updates the graphics to look more like this.
[4:13:56] <natebud> @Javaa01 It's not much of a maze, just a loop
[4:14:00] <+BionoidLCR> big mesa
[4:14:06] <+BionoidLCR> yes LUL
[4:14:06] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:14:06] <%RioGascar> but joel nealson black mesa score is pretty good to
[4:14:07] <%linSP> Hi woolie woolieF woolieF_HF
[4:14:08] <%Exiliator> yes
[4:14:08] <%generalve> no
[4:14:15] <natebud> woolie just stand still and shoot.
[4:14:18] <This_is_Marco> its fine :)
[4:14:21] <peachy996> I've made my peace with your aim
[4:14:26] <+xx123manxx> There's one Music Track in DMC1 that uses the same sample as Half-Life 1 and it weirds me out every time I hear it
[4:14:32] <natebud> this a shotgun stream now
[4:14:38] <derap41> @natebud its easier to move and aim with a controller
[4:14:43] <Sundaysmiles01> The Shotgun Scientist
[4:14:43] <%RioGascar> the lore hole is DARK
[4:14:49] <NWannabe> woolieLORE
[4:14:50] <derap41> Yeah save it for 2
[4:14:51] <%Exiliator> yes
[4:14:53] <Snakes_dk> true
[4:14:53] <@Solidus_113> HL2 is a nightmare
[4:14:53] <%Javaa01> Half Life 1 is the kickoff
[4:14:58] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> Everything with the combine is BIG body horror
[4:14:58] <Dr_Mooose> yeah shits pretty rough
[4:14:59] <%RioGascar> the BETA for half life 2 IS SO DARK
[4:14:59] <lotharrio> You'll start to feel it at the end of HL1.
[4:15:01] <%Javaa01> Half Life 2 is the start of the endgame
[4:15:04] <ripoffproductionsllc> I've never seen pysics do shit like what that cjhair did
[4:15:07] <This_is_Marco> Woolie in HL2 PogChamp
[4:15:08] <Sundaysmiles01> I can't believe you're using a controller you mad lad
[4:15:11] <+Zanco23> There's hidden easter eggs and conversations that expand the lore
[4:15:11] <natebud> @derap41 I know but the AI aim is so bad that you're usually strafing into shots that usually miss.
[4:15:13] <%Exiliator> Dont look up stuff before playing 2
[4:15:23] <%chiluzza> Half life is the pass for the Half Life 2 SLAM DUNK
[4:15:29] <derap41> Lore is all Scientist nerds
[4:15:30] <@Solidus_113> All the Black Mesa lore is around you at all times
[4:15:30] <zamzoph> audiologs
[4:15:33] <%Javaa01> Half Life story telling is in the environment
[4:15:33] <%linSP> 2 is bleak times
[4:15:35] <@Solidus_113> it's in the atmosphere
[4:15:40] <%RioGascar> you do hear dialgoue from scientists and hecu marines
[4:15:40] <DedlokPM> @BionoidLCR The message I replied to was "dev name not character name." If you learned to type your full message in 1 go instead of breaking it into multiple parts we would be avoiding this. Then again this exchange sure shows your shitty attitude to people pointing out minor foibles to what you said in full blast
[4:15:42] <ripoffproductionsllc> it's world biulding, visual/enviroment shit
[4:15:44] <%Javaa01> Not explicit item descriptions or other bullshit
[4:15:45] <%RioGascar> but its ALL implications
[4:15:51] <zamzoph> the lore in HL1 is meatgags
[4:15:54] <worldbrand> imagine if HL had soulsborne bloodstains
[4:15:59] <%RioGascar> dope
[4:16:08] <derap41> Its not as Good as 1 fight me
[4:16:10] <+Zanco23> Going to play the Half-Life 2 episodes?
[4:16:12] <+BionoidLCR> @DedlokPM thats not what it said dipshit go fuckign complain somewhere else
[4:16:13] <%Exiliator> Woolie woolieVS Half-life 2!
[4:16:20] <lotharrio> Half Life 2 is a game that secretly changes genres every few hours.
[4:16:26] <%linSP> No spoil the lore
[4:16:28] <+xx123manxx> All Half-Life games are/were free on steam For Half-Life Alyx but IDK how long that's going on for
[4:16:30] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> Whens Opposing Force remake tho?
[4:16:33] <%RioGascar> so does half life 1
[4:16:42] <+BionoidLCR> i cant get behind okami but it sure is pretty
[4:16:48] <%RioGascar> it changes the genre from horror to action back to horror and then ALL ACTION
[4:17:02] <Drakenstorm13> I've always found that half life innovated so much an was so influential that by the time i had played it it was just like everything else i ever played
[4:17:03] <arkv01> "can't wait for reggie to **** it"
[4:17:07] <%Exiliator> LUL
[4:17:07] <%RioGascar> all half life is free until alyx is out
[4:17:09] <%MintMuffinGamer> So how is everyone holding up.
[4:17:13] <%Javaa01> Just Inception the LP into existence
[4:17:13] <%RioGascar> so march 23rd
[4:17:14] <FuqBoiSlim> Okami part 108: finally getting to the haunted ship
[4:17:18] <SomersaultJustice> looking forward to that Earthbound LP!
[4:17:21] <worldbrand> cant wait for woolie playing Seaman 2 for the PS2 in japanese
[4:17:34] <%Exiliator> Lemme just book you into this thing ok? yeah ok good.
[4:17:39] <+kapcommunist> Hillary Clinton bot lol
[4:17:41] <Dr_Mooose> it's official PogChamp
[4:17:41] <+future_ry> someone just recorded that
[4:17:41] <FuqBoiSlim> YO HE SAID IT
[4:17:42] <%Tearonex> HALF LIFE ALEX CONFIRMED
[4:17:46] <peachy996> FIGHTING GAMES
[4:17:48] <shamuzu> PogChamp HE SAID IT
[4:17:48] <%linSP> Deepest lp fakes
[4:17:51] <+YabbaTroll> HE SAID IT
[4:17:52] <FuqBoiSlim> LETS GOOOO WOOLIE VS VR
[4:17:53] <arkv01> YOU SAY THIS but we are DEEP LEARNING your voice as you speak
[4:17:57] <Oncamimus> omg yes
[4:18:03] <rubbishbinge> We have enough sound clips for it
[4:18:25] <Oncamimus> yeah like...years worth
[4:18:29] <@Solidus_113> I can't believe Woolie beat that boss without healing items
[4:18:30] <worldbrand> actually those AI networks for replicating voices are getting really sophisticated, to the point where the people developing them are trying to collectively keep the algorithms from public knowledge
[4:18:31] <lotharrio> Woolie's too smart to play Half Life 2, right after he finishes Half Life.
[4:18:32] <fruit_pie_the_magician> "You're QUITE good AT turning ME on"
[4:18:36] <%RioGascar> i do hope you are enjoying half life/black mesa

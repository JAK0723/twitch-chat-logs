[0:02:39] <Mangahero18> Woolies Main is Yoshi.
[0:02:43] <ofodojo> I like FGC... and Melee
[0:02:44] <Mangahero18> What else would it be
[0:02:45] <ThatGuyThere03> they're gonna make the same joke for 4 hours
[0:02:50] <ofodojo> No way woolz is yoshi
[0:02:51] <%fairore> dam this remix hittin
[0:02:54] <roof_pizza84> Is woolz gonna become a smash streamer now that all the top smashers have been banned?
[0:02:56] <ChansonNoire> woolie probably plays samus LUL
[0:02:56] <ofodojo> He’s gonna be bad for so long
[0:03:01] <goldenjogador> this is the smell of the game... wait! this is not guity gear!
[0:03:07] <ThatGuyThere03> see
[0:03:09] <+ggbhtg> Because there's only one meme. Gotta run it into the ground, huh.
[0:03:11] <ofodojo> Cause yoshi is hard I mean
[0:03:26] <anarchistPastry> FLY
[0:03:26] <ThatGuyThere03> We can't even make topical jokes about Smash players
[0:03:30] <anarchistPastry> LIKE A BUTTERFLY
[0:03:35] <ThatGuyThere03> we gotta default back to UH OH STINKY
[0:03:41] <+ggbhtg> How often is Woolie gonna even play Melee tho @ofodojo
[0:03:48] <+i_am_wallaby> I doubt he’s trying to be wicked good at melee, Yoshi is fun as hell
[0:03:58] <ThatGuyThere03> Yoshi is fun as fuck in casuals
[0:03:59] <ofodojo> @ggbhtg prob never
[0:04:14] <+ggbhtg> @ThatGuyThere03 Imagine actually playing Smash instead of laughing at it from a distance LUL
[0:04:16] <ThatGuyThere03> but the Rollback bears investigation
[0:04:18] <+i_am_wallaby> Also beats seeing them play Fox mirrors
[0:04:20] <ofodojo> Yoshi is fun as hell. I main yoshi. But he’s more fun when you get good then when u start
[0:04:23] <roof_pizza84> I love that Kirbo is bopping in time
[0:04:24] <+ggbhtg> I would give them this Mario work, but....
[0:04:29] <HelluvaNohbody> Get all the stank jokes out now
[0:04:35] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> rn pat is super mad and he doesn't know why
[0:04:38] <HereComestheChief> SOMEBODY’S GETTING FUUUUCKED
[0:04:46] <ThatGuyThere03> Pat is just mad an confused with this and Halo
[0:04:54] <JdotSweapA> so its true....melee has rollback....
[0:04:59] <JdotSweapA> lnrBless
[0:05:01] <ThatGuyThere03> seriously how did he manage to get the worst possible intro to the series
[0:05:09] <+kaiber132> look at kirby dance!!! Look at him go!!!
[0:05:10] <BreakersAweigh> SourPls
[0:05:12] <kikoeru_san> MELEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[0:05:13] <mitchellb2597> Jigglypuff runs the table
[0:05:16] <Goodvibes99508> pat would be so disappointed
[0:05:16] <@Menitta> Sad that I can't watch this stream tonight. Paper due tomorrow. Have fun yall
[0:05:18] <%Skullgod> Meee PogChamp
[0:05:19] <VJdarkworld> Thank You Fizzi
[0:05:21] <armchairmaster_> Pat proceeds to will every Gamecube controller in a 750 mile radius to break
[0:05:25] <ThatGuyThere03> Puff is banned by order of taste and reason
[0:05:34] <+i_am_wallaby> @menitta good luck on your paper
[0:05:38] <roof_pizza84> I can feel Pat's Crazy Talk getting ready to activate
[0:05:40] <%ChoculaUltra> @Menitta good luck with the paper!
[0:05:41] <kikoeru_san> but broken GC controllers are the best
[0:05:41] <%Skullgod> Melee moon2PREGARIO
[0:05:45] <Mangahero18> Is this a For Glory or For Fun?
[0:05:45] <mitchellb2597> Puff will rise again
[0:05:52] <ofodojo> Lol what if woolie mained puff
[0:05:57] <+ggbhtg> The Big House tournament is in my area, so I've been a couple times, but I put my Smash days to rest like 3 years ago
[0:05:57] <kikoeru_san> you need broken to do dash backs
[0:06:03] <ThatGuyThere03> Is it really a GC controller if the sticks aren't disintegrated?
[0:06:05] <+i_am_wallaby> Headband Puff LUL
[0:06:13] <+hawaiianprince8oh8> I bet Pats Melee tattoo is itching right now. LUL
[0:06:14] <DDDorsett> Eww MeLeE
[0:06:17] <mitchellb2597> Puff and Kirby showdown, battle of the pink balls
[0:06:20] <VJdarkworld> @kikoeru_san UCF fixed that luckily
[0:06:23] <MeAuntieNora> Gimme your money
[0:06:24] <ThatGuyThere03> HBOX PUFF NOT ALLOWED
[0:06:26] <kikoeru_san> I know lol
[0:06:27] <bhaysic> Something about smelly people
[0:06:33] <%Rosewater_444> <3
[0:06:34] <+ggbhtg> @ThatGuyThere03 Controllers with the rubber padding removed ONLY
[0:06:35] <kikoeru_san> I actually love playing Melee
[0:06:40] <roof_pizza84> Smelly netcode
[0:06:48] <kikoeru_san> Doc and Falcon are so legit
[0:06:49] <armchairmaster_> @kikoeru_san that's the trick. Pat want's all controllers to break, but Crazy Talk instead repairs them to Factory New. This pisses off EVERY PRO SMASH PLAYER, because they don't have their jank stick drift.
[0:06:49] <chll0ne> LETS
[0:06:56] <+PotofStew23> Thumb lacerating c sticks only
[0:06:57] <ThatGuyThere03> Smelly netcode that's better than most current fighting games
[0:07:00] <+kaiber132> doodHey doodHey doodHey doodHey doodHey
[0:07:02] <%chosenjuan42> TIME TO PLAY THE GAME WHERE ONLY ONE KIND OF CONTROLLER EXISTS
[0:07:03] <ThatGuyThere03> seriously, if some dudes could do it
[0:07:10] <MattDemers> We back boysh
[0:07:11] <ThatGuyThere03> why not a multi-billion dollar company
[0:07:21] <+ChestMimik> ChestMimik subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:07:28] <+ggbhtg> From the makers of ONE GUY, they bring you....ONE JOKE
[0:07:28] <BearSawed> Ya know I understand why everyone hates HBOX, but nobody stops him from winning so....(shrugs)
[0:07:29] <HereComestheChief> SourPls
[0:07:32] <armchairmaster_> @thatguythere03 because Japan, that's why
[0:07:39] <VJdarkworld> @thatguythere03 "thats just now how we do it here buddy"
[0:07:43] <ThatGuyThere03> I REFUSE
[0:07:44] <%ChoculaUltra> not even crabs could stop HBox LUL
[0:07:44] <ofodojo> I just got a b0xx
[0:07:45] <%ChestMimik> HBox is too strong
[0:07:45] <ChansonNoire> the only person that could stop him... was himself
[0:07:50] <+TheBesteban> Woo, KI
[0:07:51] <kikoeru_san> all I want to see is the sacred combo
[0:07:51] <Aydarkzero> SourPls
[0:07:55] <ThatGuyThere03> and HBox is boring as fuck to watch when he plays
[0:07:56] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:08:02] <ThatGuyThere03> and he has a bad habit of saying dumb shit
[0:08:17] <%chosenjuan42> I hope to see 0 to death ice climbers
[0:08:36] <+ggbhtg> I can tell Hbox put a lot of work in and deserves the wins...but I met him too, and he kind of a bitch too
[0:08:36] <ThatGuyThere03> just because he has his play down to a science doesn't mean I have to enjoy it
[0:08:39] <sunnythedrunk> Also Hbox has a reputation for being an asshole to fans
[0:08:40] <chll0ne> i just realized woolie now has the song names in the corner
[0:08:41] <armchairmaster_> @chosenjuan42 no, what are we, washed up smash players? Like chudat?
[0:08:42] <%fairore> @chosenjuan42 you mean chain grabbing
[0:08:47] <ofodojo> Hbox is weird and passionate. But if he retires that would be boring. It’s really tense seeing people try to dethrone him
[0:08:58] <ThatGuyThere03> fuck that
[0:09:09] <ThatGuyThere03> some of the gods needed to retire about 4 years ago
[0:09:10] <savetitania> Passionate is not the word I'd use to describe em
[0:09:12] <BearSawed> Its almost like everyone hates how hbox plays and he doesnt care because he wins
[0:09:12] <%ChoculaUltra> I've only met a handful of the fgc big names. I got Daigo to sign a copy of his manga at EVO 2017 LUL
[0:09:14] <sunnythedrunk> He's not retiring lmao, people are blowing that outta proportion
[0:09:15] <kikoeru_san> I enjoy watching the puff match ups, I'm weird as fuck
[0:09:25] <kikoeru_san> now playing against puff? fuck that
[0:09:26] <%chosenjuan42> I bet since it's online scumbag tactics are all over
[0:09:35] <%ChestMimik> HBox sacrified style for power
[0:09:42] <armchairmaster_> Chain-grabs are for cowards. Real men try to land Ganon foot explosions out of neutral.
[0:09:46] <%Josef_Stryker> Man this song is great
[0:09:55] <%Josef_Stryker> Thank god we have Kirby showing us where it's from
[0:09:57] <%fairore> @chosenjuan42 scumbag tactics in melee ?
[0:09:58] <ThatGuyThere03> Oh apparently the guest for this stream is the creator of the Melee Rollback client
[0:10:00] <ThatGuyThere03> neat
[0:10:02] <%ChoculaUltra> call me crazy, but I don't think we're gonna see big names doing big things in the Smash community for a hot minute monkaS

[0:22:04] <+MrAtheGreat> Makes them look like DAMNED FOOLS
[0:22:06] <%SirGO0SE> o7 woolieONEGUY
[0:22:07] <+ggbhtg> TWO ONE GUYS
[0:22:09] <%jiggy_snipe> also that fix broke crossplay with ps4
[0:22:17] <%Irridium> literally woolieONEGUY fixed SFV for a brief but wonderful moment
[0:22:23] <+ManOfReason> whats better than ONE GUY? TWO GUYS
[0:22:24] <JdotSweapA> Juan Gai
[0:22:26] <%ChoculaUltra> literal years of Capcom heads giving every excuse they could find - dude bangs it out in 3 days.
[0:22:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> woolieONEGUY Over Heaven
[0:22:31] <Dumple_Roe> and the "have we made it" attitude is dangerous to companies denying to adapt
[0:22:33] <%Irridium> and his was ultimately better than what Capcom gave us
[0:22:34] <+ggbhtg> One Guy BEYONDO
[0:22:39] <+kaiber132> Is there a WoolieVersus discord?
[0:22:43] <+ggbhtg> no red tape involved either
[0:22:45] <huskarl_zap> Dont know what this is about but BASED one guy that's about all peace out.
[0:22:53] <+MrAtheGreat> Idk the melee guy here is way cooler imo because melee didn't even HAVE online to begin with!
[0:22:56] <+MrAtheGreat> GODLIKE
[0:23:06] <+ggbhtg> SFV patch didn't actually work equally for everyone, sadly
[0:23:06] <Viewtiful_Rose> We in Reggie territory today boiz
[0:23:08] <$Noponiz> well he cant change code on consoles
[0:23:20] <RunoEddie> I hope to god this man gets scouted
[0:23:21] <sunnythedrunk> @MrAtheGreat Melee did have online, but it was way way worse
[0:23:26] <$Noponiz> if he could edit files on consoles, he could probably do it couldnt he?
[0:23:30] <BlackermanZX> jp dev stubbornness is terrible
[0:23:35] <%jiggy_snipe> messing with consoles is very hard unless every console was hacked
[0:23:42] <%DensityD> is it government built? then it will cost more
[0:23:45] <+ggbhtg> HONORABLE JAPANESE NETCODE must be maintained!
[0:23:46] <+MrAtheGreat> @sunnythedrunk What?! How? It was on Gamevube?!?!
[0:24:04] <+ManOfReason> @MrAtheGreat Dolphin, the emulator
[0:24:27] <%chosenjuan42> MercyWing1 woolieONEGUY MercyWing2
[0:24:28] <sunnythedrunk> @MrAtheGreat On PC just liek this one. I don't know who created it but it existed for a few years. Fizzi perfected it by adding rollback though
[0:24:32] <%ChoculaUltra> "we could be doing other stuff" is basically game dev speak for "we're not getting paid for it so why bother lol"
[0:24:49] <+MrAtheGreat> @ManOfReason @sunnythedrunk Ooooooo... Stilll impresive though
[0:24:54] <+ggbhtg> Yeet Yighter V smh
[0:24:58] <+ggbhtg> HONORABLE JAPANESE NETCODE must be maintained!

[0:25:04] <sunnythedrunk> @MrAtheGreat Yeah super impressive, there was also no matchmaking before
[0:25:31] <VJdarkworld> Rollback priests spreading the good word
[0:25:44] <BearSawed> I just wish that I couldve been there for every I told you so moment in those meetings
[0:25:49] <%ChoculaUltra> if anyone wants a solid example about how certain heads in certain game devs/publishing houses run shit read anything about the Ubisoft shit going down
[0:25:53] <%OldManJEWc> yooo what's up people
[0:25:54] <+ggbhtg> Traditionaru Honorable Delay Based Netto Code
[0:26:02] <sunnythedrunk> When a 20 year old smash game has better online than the current one LUL
[0:26:15] <%jiggy_snipe> Japan: Works for us
[0:26:21] <+ggbhtg> I'm not gonna stop saying this, because their ideology is awful
[0:26:28] <+ggbhtg> fuck, ing, awful
[0:26:33] <%ChoculaUltra> it really is a fucking awful ideology
[0:26:34] <%fairore> @sunnythedrunk yeah it fucking sucks
[0:26:36] <@Solidus_113> one good thing from a plague
[0:26:42] <ChansonNoire> EVO LUL

[0:26:56] <%FuqBoiSlim> F
[0:26:57] <$agoaj> Can we get rollback without pedos please?
[0:26:57] <%Solidnick18> i was ready
[0:26:59] <+ggbhtg> R I P E V O
[0:27:00] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Same....
[0:27:04] <%jiggy_snipe> I wanted that so badly
[0:27:05] <%Solidnick18> That netplay matters
[0:27:07] <Mach5Mike> I wanted that day of reckoning so much....
[0:27:08] <%Irridium> that's what I wanted more than anything else
[0:27:08] <%BisoromiBear> but the future refused to change
[0:27:10] <%Solidnick18> yes
[0:27:13] <%ChoculaUltra> @agoaj I spit out my drink LUL
[0:27:13] <%SirGO0SE> it did show the world something more important, unfortunately
[0:27:15] <%Solidnick18> Just lagging everywhere
[0:27:18] <BlackermanZX> i was hyped for trashing the horrible netcode in these games
[0:27:19] <%jiggy_snipe> then they picked the 4 games with good netcode like assholes
[0:27:21] <floralkami> it was SOOOOO CLOSE
[0:27:24] <+ggbhtg> Cord pull in GFs
[0:27:27] <%Irridium> that way there's no way they can talk without the garbage being shoved in their faces
[0:27:29] <%Solidnick18> then disconnects
[0:27:31] <Dumple_Roe> SmashUlt did it without EVO'S help
[0:27:33] <Camail> the ultimate snub is "you're game isnt good enough to be at evo"
[0:27:44] <ChansonNoire> cursed skullgirls

[0:27:57] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 28 minutes and 7 seconds
[0:27:57] <@Solidus_113> TFH still got shafted, despite the new eyes on announcement
[0:27:58] <BearSawed> I think everything was impossible to predict
[0:28:02] <+ggbhtg> Skullgirls will never be a real girl.... bizSad
[0:28:05] <BlackermanZX> ...and then one guy killed evo hard
[0:28:21] <sonofthedeepsouth> !uptime
[0:28:23] <%ChoculaUltra> I really, really wanted to get into Granblue but after the first month of online play I went back to the gacha game FeelsBadMan
[0:28:25] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> HELL YEAH Skullgirls is finally being recognized! Wait...Mike, Mike what are you doing? MIKE! NOO!!
[0:28:29] <+ggbhtg> that's more so One Legacy, rather than One Guy

[0:28:41] <%SirGO0SE> I am Mighty Keef had a FIELD DAY
[0:29:06] <SymphonicMetalCitadel> It's bizarre how invested I am in the netcode situation due to the podcast, despite my having never played fighting games

[0:29:44] <JdotSweapA> woow

[0:29:44] <%Solidnick18> is better then delay
[0:29:45] <+ggbhtg> oh, Sam Sho being trash, got it
[0:29:46] <Camail> remote play is better, smh
[0:29:47] <%Solidnick18> yeah
[0:29:54] <VJdarkworld> lol
[0:29:59] <%ChoculaUltra> I live exactly 8 literal blocks from my friend who I play DBFZ with on Steam. Both of us have hard ethernet connections - still get 5-6 frame delays occasionally. HOW SWAY.
[0:30:00] <%mike2hands> woolieFUN
[0:30:00] <%Mr_Ease> Still way better than Smash Ultimates... everything
[0:30:01] <+McSoliace> tekken also has that
[0:30:02] <%ChestMimik> I liked the one match in Samsho that took less than 20 minutes to connect, and I can play most games fine. Samsho's weird.
[0:30:06] <wisconsinjoe> Oh jeeeesus that’s bad
[0:30:10] <floralkami> @kosorsomesaykosm_ Mike: what was that? more cringe? you want MORE shitty workplace behavior? okaaaay, don't blame me if you can't breathe under this weight!
[0:30:12] <%Solidnick18> i think they said something with parsec and samsho or something
[0:30:20] <Dumple_Roe> old SamSho collection is using rollback
[0:30:31] <Viewtiful_Rose> I love SamSho 7 but it’s netcode is depressing
[0:30:46] <Zayasu> @Dumple_Roe yes and its still awful
[0:30:50] <DingasKhan> tvc >:)
[0:30:52] <$BallerSwagBro9k> HD GAMECUBE
[0:30:54] <Viewtiful_Rose> But yes the collection has rollback
[0:30:59] <+ggbhtg> Dolphin is the goat beyond goats
[0:31:03] <Davimotion96> Can this work with the gamecube version of CvS 2?
[0:31:09] <%gatorafan> HD GameCubes are amazing FeelsGoodMan
[0:31:09] <%jiggy_snipe> Dolphin is the best emulator
[0:31:17] <+Hayasage> Dolphin is on another level from every other emulator
[0:31:32] <+MrAtheGreat> BTW Who here wants nintendo to have the gamecube library on switch?
[0:31:37] <+pebblypirate> @WoolieVersus is there any plans on getting music on netplay?
[0:31:40] <+TheBesteban> Oh hi
[0:31:57] <%ChoculaUltra> I remember seeing how to install HD textures into Xenoblade Chronicles with Dolphin and I was a changed man. Dolphin is OP.
[0:32:01] <+ManOfReason> Shoutouts
[0:32:04] <+Wool> @pebblypirate there's already a way to add music to Slippi
[0:32:11] <+pebblypirate> sick
[0:32:13] <+EternalJedi> as far as I know, Dolphin will run literally anything save for ONE game they're still trying to get to work
[0:32:15] <BearSawed> @MrAtheGreat Nah, theyll just sell you the same 75 nes and snes games again
[0:32:20] <+pebblypirate> ill check it out
[0:32:31] <+dieselssb> @eternaljedi is it cel damage?

[0:32:54] <Nekros4442> That was legit my experience with BBxTag, I couldnt play online so I returned it immediately
[0:32:56] <Camail> then you pres a button.... and wait
[0:32:58] <%ChoculaUltra> Remember when P4G finally hit Steam and killed Vita emulation in literal hours? Crazy shit.
[0:32:59] <+Hayasage> DBFZ
[0:32:59] <$agoaj> Yeah, a bunch of work going into getting rollback into Pocket Fighters EX. Have to throw out a bunch of basic Unity code.

[0:33:35] <+IronBagel1> I love Centralfiction, but the online is dead, and atrocious
[0:33:36] <$BallerSwagBro9k> OOF
[0:33:36] <VJdarkworld> BibleThump
[0:33:54] <ChansonNoire> anecdotal evidence, but granblue is more than fine if I keep it to montreal... elitist reggie Kappa
[0:33:54] <MattDemers> I forgot Granblue even came out
[0:33:58] <%ChoculaUltra> thats fucking stupid.
[0:34:00] <%Irridium> I pushed through it with DBFZ for a while but... it wore me down man. especially in this covid world
[0:34:11] <+MrAtheGreat> @ChoculaUltra I wonder if any mods were made for P4 emus was just moved over to the pc port and how easy that was
[0:34:14] <BearSawed> Meanwhile KI
[0:34:18] <floralkami> @choculaultra you mean as in people stopped looking for P4G ROMs?
[0:34:21] <ChansonNoire> YO LIGHTNING MODE
[0:34:24] <%ChoculaUltra> @Irridium I know that feel "maybe next match will be better" FeelsBadMan
[0:34:26] <Nekros4442> and this is why we're looking on at the Japanese fighting game roundtable with very very vested interest. I want every company at that table to commit to better online because there is no more alternative.
[0:34:28] <%ElectricEmissary> yooooo
[0:34:47] <+ggbhtg> Tekken 7 has turbo mode special matches with the AI, SO YOU'RE SAYING?....

[0:35:04] <+ManOfReason> 300hz? Lol
[0:35:04] <%ChoculaUltra> @floralkami a little bit of both, Vita emulation had some hang ups with a couple of games, P4 being one of them. So when the official port hit PC the scene kinda just stopped caring.
[0:35:07] <ChansonNoire> tekken has rollback.. but only 3
[0:35:16] <+IronBagel1> Tekken 7 is 3
[0:35:20] <%gatorafan> What is this science shit I'm hearing? daedra1DrunkTibs
[0:35:30] <%DensityD> m e l e e
[0:35:44] <ChansonNoire> lightning mode is one of the special mode where everything runs at 2.5x ish speed
[0:35:44] <%ChoculaUltra> so its like, the one game everyone wanted emulated can now be bought straight up and it sort of just faded away~
[0:35:46] <+dieselssb> Melee is sick
[0:35:46] <+Hayasage> If smash weren't a party game we wouldn't have rollback PogChamp
[0:35:57] <+spaghetti_shaman> This isn't Persona Arena Q
[0:35:59] <$agoaj> Smash Ultimate only supports 90fps aka 1.5x speed.
[0:36:02] <sunnythedrunk> Lightning mode PogChamp
[0:36:04] <+spaghetti_shaman> I've been bamboozled
[0:36:09] <+dieselssb> @hayasage holy shit PogChamp

[0:36:09] <christopherwpoindexter> I enjoy competitive multiplayer in any genre, I feel and have experienced directly the appeal...but I'm so burned out with Hot Wheels and ToonTown having been shut down (which is more mmo), other games being so blah, and a lack of availability from friends to do local or online in the game I play, I've just become a hard near-100% single player stan, fighting or any game
[0:36:12] <%DensityD> it's just humanly impossible to react to something that comes out in 5 frames Jebaited
[0:36:13] <%SuperKirby24> LUL

[0:36:14] <$Noponiz> has anyopne actually confirmed the tekken claims? SOunds like poor english skills at work
[0:36:15] <floralkami> @choculaultra ah, thank you. now to just hold my breath for Atlus to port P4AU to Steam with rollback... yep
[0:36:21] <Camail> its a chicken and the egg situation
[0:36:21] <StarkMaximum> Fighting game players move at FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT
[0:36:24] <+ggbhtg> Sakurai was from DA FUTURE
[0:36:24] <%LynbellDaYo> Party games have defeated fighting games
[0:36:26] <Davimotion96> IWATA
[0:36:32] <christopherwpoindexter> *in the games I play,
[0:36:35] <Dumple_Roe> Blessed Melee
[0:36:38] <%ElectricEmissary> LIGHTNING MODE FOR FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT
[0:36:38] <+ggbhtg> SssTAMINA!
[0:36:39] <Mach5Mike> Sakurai unintentionally made Melee immortal
[0:36:41] <floralkami> @noponiz yes, it's 3
[0:37:04] <christopherwpoindexter> I WASTED SO MANY HOURS just playing Stamina Mode in Melee, no records or stats to show for it 😅
[0:37:04] <%Asuterisuku> Melee was clunky and jank and had problems and that in the end made it beloved for some reason.
[0:37:11] <%ChoculaUltra> @floralkami it only took them 8 years to get P4G out of the dregs. There's hope FeelsBadMan
[0:37:24] <@Solidus_113> you'll find a bunch of exploits from the most interesting places. Like the recent PS2 hack with the DVD drive
[0:37:24] <%DensityD> they hate the money
[0:37:35] <%ChoculaUltra> oh god I made myself sad, Atlus really does hate money
[0:37:40] <ofodojo> Third strike rollback?? :-)
[0:37:41] <StarkMaximum> @christopherwpoindexter Yo Stamina mode in Smash is HEAVILY underappreciated
[0:37:51] <%ChestMimik> Doesn't switch homebrew hacking involve the joycon charger?
[0:37:55] <%blaccbird914> no more than three though :)

[0:38:10] <%DensityD> woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:38:13] <Cymen90> I hope some dev will be brave enough to make a fighting game that is fun and not made for the FGC :)
[0:38:15] <%HostilePoundcakes> HostilePoundcakes subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! I can't believe the zapping system saved Melee Kappa
[0:38:16] <%Skullgod> 3 years if we are lucky tbh
[0:38:17] <BearSawed> or I dont know maybe build a game around it
[0:38:20] <%Irridium> god Smash Ultimate's netcode is awful. probably the worst I personally experienced

[0:38:45] <$BallerSwagBro9k> WE SMASHIN
[0:38:48] <DDDorsett> ouch
[0:38:51] <%Solidnick18> BOP
[0:38:56] <%jiggy_snipe> FIghtcade exists for alot of arcade versions of fighting games
[0:39:03] <StarkMaximum> The part that sucks about Melee is there's no characters i like to play, I like big strong unga bunga dudes and both DK and Bowser suck so much ass
[0:39:07] <christopherwpoindexter> @starkmaximum thanks for the affirmation fam, that's prob why. I think I just wanted an excuse for traditional fighting game mechanics (HP, not falling off screen) with Mario characters, and liked watching characters *die?* that doesn't sound psychotic or fetish at all 🤣😬
[0:39:10] <StarkMaximum> And they're kind of the only choices
[0:39:10] <TheZearGuy> A real hero
[0:39:12] <%ChoculaUltra> can we get rollback into UMvC3 tho? Asking for a friend :)
[0:39:16] <+ggbhtg> dang, that was plenty of time for me to set this up over here, but I was chatting about how dumb Japan is
[0:39:25] <sunnythedrunk> @StarkMaximum Don't sleep on DK, he's got some sauce
[0:39:25] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Man woolie how do ya set this up?
[0:39:26] <Aussie_Manny> If only they had chosen a game that isn't only 5 characters tho. doodDerp
[0:39:29] <StarkMaximum> @christopherwpoindexter Not "die"! "Get knocked out"! It's different!
[0:39:29] <+ggbhtg> L is REAL, now and forever
[0:39:32] <VJdarkworld> dark souls with rollback is my other dream.......
[0:39:32] <+dieselssb> @starkmaximum what about Ganon?
[0:39:33] <savetitania> The fact that the madman coded an in-game UI for netplay is amazing
[0:39:33] <christopherwpoindexter> but that was 9-ish years ago, too 😛
[0:39:38] <%Solidnick18> i only played weegee for the most part
[0:39:42] <StarkMaximum> @dieselssb lol sure
[0:39:46] <+Hayasage> It gets better
[0:39:48] <%ChestMimik> I'd probably get into Melee if they had the Zelda I got used to from Ult
[0:39:54] <%DensityD> Shout Of Earth
[0:39:54] <@Solidus_113> this slick UI
[0:39:54] <floralkami> @choculaultra ngl, the SMT3N announcement has me with a sliver of hope, since it is a more niche title, meaning they ARE looking at their old games and thinking what to do with them. only a little, but better than no hope at all.
[0:40:01] <StarkMaximum> @sunnythedrunk I guess so but I feel like I'm just gonna get combo'd to death forever by Fox and Falco and Marth
[0:40:04] <christopherwpoindexter> @starkmaximum exactly, that drew that appeal away, but it was funny seeing them panting and chilling on the ground 😅
[0:40:09] <Mr_Bop> Woolie playing melee? Dang
[0:40:16] <Aussie_Manny> Maaaan, it's a trip seeing such a small roster screen now. LUL
[0:40:18] <%ChestMimik> I just want my Stando powah
[0:40:18] <DragonSpooker> No Terry?
[0:40:21] <ofodojo> @starkmaximum unless you wanna like win tournaments you can def get good enough to play friendlies with dk or ganon
[0:40:30] <JdotSweapA> duude
[0:40:30] <StarkMaximum> Oh my god Online Play literally fits in like it never didn't belong there
[0:40:33] <albobomb> Woah thats amazing
[0:40:33] <$BallerSwagBro9k> GODLIKE MOD
[0:40:38] <%ChoculaUltra> @floralkami true that! I'm still kinda in disbelief SMT3N got announced. Like in shock really LUL
[0:40:38] <StarkMaximum> It just looks so natural, like Melee was always onliny
[0:40:39] <sunnythedrunk> @StarkMaximum Watch Rishi vs Kuysashi. Marth is def doable. I feel you on the spacies matchup, you gotta have perfect punish game
[0:40:45] <VJdarkworld> UX time
[0:40:45] <christopherwpoindexter> @starkmaximum RIGHT?!?
[0:40:50] <+IronBagel1> Godlike implementation
[0:40:53] <+EternalJedi> so is this Project M? or a separate thing?
[0:41:00] <%Skullgod> its regular melee with rollback
[0:41:02] <%ChoculaUltra> its a separate thing
[0:41:02] <$agoaj> This is Melee in an emulator
[0:41:03] <%Skullgod> and matchmaking
[0:41:05] <Aussie_Manny> Project M is dead, no?
[0:41:07] <Winner_92> Nah this is entirely separate from project M, PM was a mod for brawl
[0:41:08] <Mach5Mike> It looks like the Melee HD that we've always wanted
[0:41:11] <%Asuterisuku> Project M was a Brawl mod, @EternalJedi
[0:41:13] <BearSawed> Project M was a brawl mod
[0:41:13] <StarkMaximum> @ofodojo I guess that's fair tbh, I just struggle to enjoy myself knowing it'd be so much easier to just abandon my preferences and play the good characters that I don't unerstand
[0:41:15] <christopherwpoindexter> @starkmaximum "Nintendo live, coming November 31st, 2001" 😎
[0:41:16] <%jiggy_snipe> I wonder if this could be used for Brawl on Dolphin and therefore Project M
[0:41:17] <%DensityD> mintendo tire mhis nan!
[0:41:22] <%ChoculaUltra> is it + or x monkaS
[0:41:23] <Aussie_Manny> 🐬
[0:41:24] <$BallerSwagBro9k> HIYAAAAAAAAAAAA
[0:41:25] <Personified134> defaults to fox LUL
[0:41:28] <+linSP> dolphin is the hd switch right
[0:41:29] <+pebblypirate> @EternalJedi project M is a mod of brawl to make it like melee, this is just melee with netcode
[0:41:30] <Aussie_Manny> FIYAAAAAAAAAA
[0:41:33] <+dieselssb> @eternaljedi pm was a brawl mod. this is some code built into dolphin specifically for melee
[0:41:36] <$BallerSwagBro9k> LELEELELELELELELEME
[0:41:37] <+EternalJedi> ahhhh
[0:41:39] <+EternalJedi> ty, guys
[0:41:46] <christopherwpoindexter> wait November 31st isn't a real date OOP🤭
[0:41:56] <VJdarkworld> UX so important
[0:41:56] <Aussie_Manny> TO-YAAAH!
[0:41:59] <ofodojo> @starkmaximum I feel you. The top tiers are really good too. I play yoshi and you sorta just lose for a very long time b4 you start winning. With top tiers you can win matches very quickly
[0:42:05] <%DensityD> Hintendo mire nhis tan!

[0:42:40] <%DensityD> oh man what a smelly tunnel
[0:42:44] <$BallerSwagBro9k> I tried playing but there's only Falco/Fox players LUL
[0:42:52] <StarkMaximum> @ofodojo At least Falcon is always hype, I could pick up Falcon
[0:42:54] <christopherwpoindexter> @choculaultra I blame NakeyJakey for making me aware of those
[0:43:01] <christopherwpoindexter> "blame"
[0:43:01] <ofodojo> Fizzi the hero

[0:43:20] <Aussie_Manny> SUMMUS
[0:43:27] <%DensityD> CHET
[0:43:31] <ChansonNoire> bro I fucking called it its sheamus
[0:43:36] <VJdarkworld> @ballerswagbro9k i rarely see fox. its mainly falco and marth
[0:43:38] <aquova_> This is such dark magic. It's one thing to think about good UI/UX if you have the source code, but this guy managed to have these sensibilities while hacking a released game
[0:43:39] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus flux looks like it's on
[0:43:43] <Doctoroculat> ive been playing this nonstop all week
[0:43:45] <StarkMaximum> I love how Woolie's username in his personal life is Shout of Earth, what an extra name

[0:44:08] <DragonSpooker> Samus yooooo
[0:44:14] <BearSawed> Pound? rockin it old school
[0:44:20] <%DensityD> poundo
[0:44:21] <floralkami> @choculaultra Atlus really said "play a REAL SMT game, nerds" *cough*Persona isn't SMT in the first place and should be treated as such *cough* hardcore SMT stans only make it harder for newcomers to feel comfortable to check it out without comparing it to Persona *coughcoughHACK*
[0:44:22] <StarkMaximum> @ggbhtg Yeah I'm aware, I did have to look it up tho just to remember
[0:44:25] <Aussie_Manny> Pound. ;)
[0:44:27] <christopherwpoindexter> I hate that I have main first-party Nintendo GameCube games bought for $20-odd circa 2010 at GameStop, now you can never find them on future console generations or legit old copies without $100 for the mainline mascot entries, now I feel ahead of the curve but also guilty 🤪
[0:44:27] <%ChoculaUltra> "the hashtag key"
[0:44:28] <savetitania> # into rest
[0:44:30] <%Asuterisuku> Before it was Pound, it was Sharp.

[0:46:12] <christopherwpoindexter> I love that there's room for big-ass usernames and a delay counter, albeit resolution-adjusted
[0:46:12] <+ggbhtg> Don't get 4 stock- LET'S GO
[0:46:13] <DragonSpooker> I like Samus' old missile stance
[0:46:16] <+ManOfReason> Hugh Hugh, get fked

[0:46:23] <%ChoculaUltra> like I would think Woolie and Reggie are playing local was I not here for the start

[0:46:28] <+ggbhtg> WE TAKE THOSE
[0:46:45] <christopherwpoindexter> because it's PRO GAMING idk actually

[0:47:05] <Ultimatefool> Why does this have better netcode than DragonBall
[0:47:06] <GeltonZ> @DensityD Yup
[0:47:11] <%ChoculaUltra> Dreamland louder than the other tracks? Sakurai's bias shines LUL
[0:47:11] <floralkami> @choculaultra does it really have Dante in it? I've only seen people refer to it, but never seen pics posted (also guessing the joke is why would Persona fans be expected to know or care for DMC)?
[0:47:14] <christopherwpoindexter> exactly, professionals I get they would get tired of it or distracted
[0:47:16] <+ManOfReason> Slippi

[0:47:51] <%Asuterisuku> You notice there were no transformations in that match either.
[0:48:04] <%Th3SmartAlec> huh
[0:48:04] <StarkMaximum> Yeah I caught that
[0:48:08] <floralkami> OH GOD it's DMC2 Dante!! eski66S
[0:48:08] <%ChestMimik> PS is the glitchy legal one, right?
[0:48:10] <%DensityD> that's called "cutting the chaff"
[0:48:11] <%ChoculaUltra> @floralkami He's a secret boss! P tough too. I figure that all the Joker Smash fans will be drawn to SMT3 since the Dante rumors in Smash didn't pay out LUL
[0:48:16] <Aussie_Manny> HEY WOOLIE! How's it feeling?

[0:48:25] <ChansonNoire> its not fixed :(
[0:48:26] <Dcrapman77> So this is the fella that put roleback in?
[0:48:27] <StarkMaximum> A technical limitation that makes the game MORE PLAYABLE
[0:48:30] <%Skullgod> fuck pokemon stadium
[0:48:31] <%Asuterisuku> This isn't PS2.

[1:06:54] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> tyvm
[1:07:09] <ShawnEXE> Melee is deep cause iwata went bonkers on it due to time restrictions

[1:07:11] <JayPastaForce> This is like MEtal gear vs Ray
[1:07:18] <%Asuterisuku> @ChoculaUltra Because they had about eight months of development time.

[1:10:39] <OldOnyx> only valid input device is a broken NES pad with tacks taped to the side
[1:10:45] <+moink1234> Some tech also just needs tap jump to be viable

[1:15:12] <%DensityD> CRABS
[1:15:18] <%Asuterisuku> They're really good triggers, though, and I wish Nintando hadn't dropped Analogue triggers entirely.
[1:15:23] <ShawnEXE> @Davimotion96 To do a tilt, most people hold up during inactionable frames
[1:15:26] <@Solidus_113> Gamecube ASMR
[1:15:30] <ShawnEXE> to do a smash you just smash it

[1:18:29] <%DensityD> LIGHT PUNCH!
[1:18:33] <SuperTurboSABER> dont let them play
[1:18:34] <Davimotion96> I really don't know how smash players handle all those weird angles and subtle motions with the sticks. Like, I can do standing 720, Korean Backdash and Electrics on an arcade stick, but man, I can't even fathom doing all that soft movementsin the middle of a fight
[1:18:40] <+ggbhtg> RUN THE STICKS WOOLIE
[1:18:45] <@Solidus_113> There's a wall on the KoF stage
[1:18:47] <ChansonNoire> @WoolieVersus remember to grab the ledge with the grapple hook

[1:19:37] <ChansonNoire> @ChoculaUltra if youre talking about ultimate, its actually harder to tilt in that game than the other games
[1:19:39] <%ChestMimik> @ChoculaUltra Same way you do every other fighting game input, you eventually just get used to it
[1:19:40] <@Solidus_113> 4Head
[1:19:46] <%DensityD> dash dance more
[1:19:56] <ShawnEXE> the reason why we can do this complicated shit is cause it's mostly all intuitive because its physics based
[1:20:12] <+GalacticaPhanto> Woolie learning Smash is super interesting and I'm all about it
[1:20:15] <ShawnEXE> the reason smash kiddies find fighting game inputs difficult is because it's not intuitive
[1:20:15] <rcand9> reggie redeemed
[1:20:17] <+Archphronimos> NICE WHIPS REGGIE!
[1:20:25] <+Archphronimos> whip*
[1:20:26] <VJdarkworld> @davimotion96 yeh the tricks around it is using buffer system. in melee u can buffer after L cancel for example
[1:20:31] <%DensityD> green samus = woolie
[1:20:43] <ShawnEXE> every move in smash looks like the direction and move you do them in
[1:20:54] <%Struggleful> See me on Jungle Japes tho Kappa
[1:20:57] <Doublemint_Dave_> I’ve been learning melee lately, wish I have gotten in sooner
[1:21:11] <%DensityD> shawn what does that mean
[1:21:32] <+Archphronimos> to anyone who woulud know: is it odd to play Samus with much more emphasis on her ranged attacks?
[1:21:45] <%SirGO0SE> omg
[1:21:49] <%SirGO0SE> is that really what its called
[1:21:51] <ShawnEXE> basically like, why does this command motion look like this. in smash when you see a move you can guess exactly how to do the input even without playing the character
[1:21:58] <rcand9> yo reggie start stylin plz
[1:22:03] <Kiyoku422> Every time falcon hits his gentlemen god kisses an angel on the forehead
[1:22:05] <ShawnEXE> but you can't look at a super and assume the input
[1:22:13] <ShawnEXE> or pretzal motions, etc
[1:22:17] <Viewtiful_Rose> Woolie is playing right now

[1:22:54] <ShawnEXE> yeah exactly
[1:23:09] <Kalcom> used to
[1:23:19] <%DensityD> there are exceptions to that rule, like grounded link up-B

[1:23:59] <+Chronoreyer> I giggled when I saw slippi recorded apm when you play and look at the replay
[1:24:15] <Doublemint_Dave_> @galacticaphanto there’s a smash version of a hitbox
[1:24:21] <Mr_Bop> smash had a bit of that yoo
[1:24:22] <%DensityD> and honestly, I always thought ice climbers' neutral special looked like it came from forward special, and vice versa
[1:24:23] <ShawnEXE> there is a hitbox for smash
[1:24:23] <+GalacticaPhanto> oh?
[1:24:34] <Doublemint_Dave_> Smash box I think it’s called
[1:24:37] <Doublemint_Dave_> Or some shit
[1:24:38] <Mr_Bop> Tafokints did that kind of stuff
[1:24:43] <%ChestMimik> Not useless but the benefit isn't as obvious
[1:24:46] <+GalacticaPhanto> I'd have to look into it because I'd be down for that
[1:24:47] <$agoaj> More orange, I thnk I might be getting scurvy
[1:25:01] <ShawnEXE> yeah thats true but the beauty of those moves is that as long as the opponent is in that direction, you'll hit them

[1:27:25] <Mucmaster> Shit I just tuned in and those figures behind Reggie made me think he was wearing cat ears
[1:27:26] <%Mr_Ease> The fact that you can't even directly ensure that you can have items off, in Ultimate online is awful

[1:28:51] <%ChestMimik> @rcand9 As far as I can tell, the ethernet connection itself is stable. The games that use it vary in quality.
[1:28:52] <%Struggleful> Online Ice Climber players PogChamp
[1:28:56] <+IronBagel1> It'll probably be a circlejerk of promotional material, and they'll dodge the rollback question completely
[1:28:59] <%SirGO0SE> I KNOW ALL ABOUT THAT
[1:29:04] <%gatorafan> @Jetzord An Arika guy will be there, maybe they'll start complaining about piracy and how that somehow means no rollback Kappa
[1:29:10] <JayPastaForce> Blainville omg

[1:29:40] <%ChestMimik> @rcand9 Yup, that's why the complaint is about fixing Smash Ultimate specifically
[1:29:41] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah this definitely looks like Flux filtering
[1:29:42] <BlackermanZX> that fighting game roundtable sounds crazy
[1:29:50] <Viewtiful_Rose> I modded my melee rom to play dumbass songs on certain stages
[1:29:52] <%Solidnick18> get some chill beats in here
[1:29:53] <Rangenade> Playing games without music is really interesting especially Megaman X4
[1:29:55] <JayPastaForce> Ain't no Samsora
[1:29:59] <compositefrylock> LEMME SMASH
[1:30:01] <nxflre> music removed for copyriught right?
[1:30:12] <compositefrylock> Smashing
[1:30:13] <Doublemint_Dave_> no it messes with the rollback apparently
[1:30:15] <GeltonZ> @nxflre Nah, music interferred with netcode
[1:30:19] <+IronBagel1> Playing Guilty Gear without music is like removing half the game
[1:30:20] <Viewtiful_Rose> No for rollback purposes
[1:30:22] <%Asuterisuku> Some good pulls for these turnips.
[1:30:26] <ThatGuyThere03> You need to kill some shy guys as an offering to Randal
[1:30:29] <nxflre> ah makes sense

[1:32:41] <+ImpHelpSingIt> is this a fisticuffs episode?
[1:32:48] <Mucmaster> Could spectator mode just be a temporary input file passed to anyone who's in a lobby?
[1:32:50] <+phone5> Question for Fizzi: Fizzi, instead of a report button, why not an option to hide the offensive username from the player?

[1:39:31] <ShawnEXE> honestly in most fighting games you tend to spend more time in the lobby than actually fighting lmao

[1:40:08] <+pkmamsters> Reggie's short breaths are good
[1:40:20] <%RyTYoung> I just played Tetris Effect for the first time, and holy shit that is some insanely good shit
[1:40:23] <CorruptDropbear> It's probably a little too dodgy if one person has a bad delay
[1:40:25] <+dieselssb> Mario climbers is too nuts lol I saw that too
[1:40:29] <$agoaj> Double Troubles
[1:40:30] <%DensityD> problematic in 2020
[1:40:42] <%SirGO0SE> rollback may also not work as well with 4

[1:40:55] <anarchistPastry> bro
[1:40:58] <concretenj> doesn't Lethal League have rollback
[1:41:01] <rcand9> yo
[1:41:01] <anarchistPastry> you played CoD?
[1:41:02] <Rabspat> There's Lethal League
[1:41:09] <sunnythedrunk> FPS use rollback

[1:41:15] <%ElectricEmissary> Lethal league blaze
[1:41:18] <Mucmaster> For a roll back with more than 2 you essentailly need a dedicated server
[1:41:30] <+Msytic6> Wouldnt that be kind of ground breaking?
[1:41:42] <+pkmamsters> @RyTYoung playing Tetris Effect during winter nights with headphones and lights off is one of the most mesmerizing experiences
[1:41:54] <rcand9> THIS GAME
[1:41:54] <%SirGO0SE> @sunnythedrunk and the short comings are pretty clear arent they?
[1:42:02] <%SilvaChariot0133> LUL
[1:42:02] <rcand9> nice
[1:42:04] <%SilvaChariot0133> YEYEYE
[1:42:04] <ChansonNoire> this falco LUL
[1:42:12] <%SirGO0SE> tons of "i know i hit him" or "he didnt hit me" then getting the opposite on the kill cam
[1:42:16] <VJdarkworld> reggie feelin himself
[1:42:20] <+GalacticaPhanto> Shin Reggie
[1:42:37] <sunnythedrunk> @SirGO0SE Well some are better than others. It's just crazy that Halo 2 had rollback and some fighting games don't have it in 2020
[1:42:39] <rcand9> reggie wake up hello
[1:43:07] <+pkmamsters> Combusting: "shit. I thought i was gonna play woolie. I can't handle KICK DADDY"
[1:43:11] <ShawnEXE> reggie's fox is so rusty
[1:43:12] <%SirGO0SE> halo 2 has a lot of things we dont have in 2020 haha
[1:43:25] <ItsSleepyBoi> wish Kage was there
[1:43:37] <sunnythedrunk> Why Reggie's Samus better than his Fox
[1:43:38] <%ElectricEmissary> nice mangle Reggie
[1:43:40] <+Hayasage> Fox isn't a character you can just jump into without warming up usually
[1:43:41] <JetpackMcQuack> btw emulated gamecubes over a network
[1:43:53] <JetpackMcQuack> gameattackHolyPoop
[1:43:56] <ShawnEXE> fox is super technical so you can't just jump on fox
[1:44:12] <rcand9> PogChamp is reggie gonna lose
[1:44:30] <ShawnEXE> maybe something comparable is playing guilty gear and not being able to play baiken
[1:44:32] <ChansonNoire> theres also a good chance combusting knows fox matchup much better
[1:44:35] <%DensityD> Zintendo Zire Zis Zan

[1:44:41] <%CaptainPileDriver> Reggie a fake fox confirmed
[1:44:47] <Davybot> more like "whens Air Ride online"
[1:45:01] <ShawnEXE> also yeah fox is usually the training dummy for most players
[1:45:05] <%DensityD> Davybot you reopen my wound
[1:45:05] <%jiggy_snipe> true
[1:45:07] <ShawnEXE> so even though fox is the best
[1:45:09] <%DensityD> it hurts
[1:45:13] <Davybot> haha
[1:45:13] <rcand9> BibleThump
[1:45:14] <%SilvaChariot0133> NotLikeTHis
[1:45:18] <ShawnEXE> fox is also the most played against

[1:45:22] <%ElectricEmissary> BibleThump
[1:45:22] <+pkmamsters> the truth hurts

[1:45:37] <%jiggy_snipe> Nintendo has more problems than rollback in Ultimate LUL
[1:45:38] <VJdarkworld> BibleThump
[1:45:47] <%jiggy_snipe> like their entire online infrastructure
[1:45:48] <rcand9> reggie goin silent mode
[1:45:49] <SatoruMasamune> Woolie's wasting out time with a dead game while Pat addresses the REAL questions: how much of a milk addict is Captain N's Simon Belmont?
[1:45:49] <%ChestMimik> Ult also has a LOT of other problems, rollback is only one of many
[1:45:59] <$agoaj> Add CPU switchover to Slippi
[1:46:10] <%Irridium> Ultimate's netcode is like the worst with wi-fi too. They have the money to fix it but they just don't care. Shit's infuriating.
[1:46:27] <christopherwpoindexter> NASCAR and Tony Hawk GameCube games on Dolphin nethack rollback when 😆🤪
[1:46:31] <sunnythedrunk> This is probably Sakurai's last smash game
[1:46:42] <VJdarkworld> isnt there something about how ARMS uses some type of rollback system?
[1:46:43] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:46:43] <ShawnEXE> in it's core smash is primarily a game meant to be played on the couch with a bunch of friends
[1:46:49] <rcand9> NICE
[1:46:52] <%jiggy_snipe> nasty
[1:46:57] <ShawnEXE> and even if those friends don't know how to play smash well
[1:46:59] <+pkmamsters> It's Nintendo and Bandai
[1:47:00] <%SilvaChariot0133> LUL
[1:47:03] <ShawnEXE> they'll probably have a good time

[1:54:51] <+Hayasage> If you play Falcon you probably wanna go fast
[1:55:03] <Viewtiful_Rose> Marvel was one of the games I wanted to try first but never actually got good at
[1:55:05] <%trustycoyote> @Meltgar I'd give it a try. You'd be surprised. Because even if you are getting hit, you can still make choices.
[1:55:10] <@Solidus_113> Everything you need to learn Killer Instinct you can get from watching Woolie's "GIFG The Lab" for KI
[1:55:11] <sunnythedrunk> Fizzi is all about the oppression session
[1:55:12] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Falcon Mains are insane. T. Falcon main
[1:55:18] <+ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> KI is all like "Yo, I heard you like mix ups..."

[1:55:31] <Meltgar> @trustycoyote doodGood
[1:55:39] <garrulousAuthority> every time I think about getting into KI I remember Max doing a 200 hit combo and then I stop thinking about getting into KI

[1:58:54] <%TheLemuroid> Actual 20XX discussion
[1:59:01] <+Chronoreyer> @fangovafang a wavedash is when your character slides across the ground because you airdodge into it at an angle
[1:59:27] <rcand9> let's go meggie
[1:59:27] <Doublemint_Dave_> wavedashing feels better than sex
[1:59:34] <%Skullgod> tru
[1:59:40] <Meltgar> LUL
[1:59:49] <fangovafang> @chronoreyer damn dat sound tough to do NotLikeThis
[1:59:52] <%ElectricEmissary> following up on chrono, it allows for more microspacing options and allows you to grounded attacks like smash attacks while still moving
[1:59:58] <+Chronoreyer> it sounds a lot harder than it actually is
[2:00:01] <+Hayasage> LUL He tried
[2:00:01] <+OroOreo> oh hey he walked up slowly and downsmashed
[2:00:06] <savetitania> wavedashing is way easier than short hop fast fall aerials
[2:00:07] <+Chronoreyer> you just jump and hit the trigger while holding down and forward
[2:00:08] <Doublemint_Dave_> wavedashing comes very naturally
[2:00:19] <savetitania> it's basically a one-two one-two
[2:00:33] <%ElectricEmissary> yeah, shffling is honestly harder than wavedashing
[2:00:42] <sunnythedrunk> Reggie styling
[2:00:49] <Doublemint_Dave_> short hopping is stupid hard in melee compared to ult lol
[2:00:49] <+Chronoreyer> understanding why to wave dash is much much harder than learning how to actually do it
[2:00:49] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:00:55] <savetitania> for the record, in melee, fox and samus have a 2-frame short-hop window
[2:01:01] <Mucmaster> The first parry is the hardest since you can't react to the Chun-li super
[2:01:08] <savetitania> if you don't press and release within two frames
[2:01:13] <savetitania> you can't short-hop
[2:01:13] <fangovafang> ok 🤔.I'll it next time
[2:01:22] <+Hayasage> Yeah SHFFL actually varies depending on whether you whiff, end in hit stun, or end in shield stun

[2:01:26] <+Chronoreyer> reggie hittin techs

[2:01:29] <+ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> @WoolieVersus Is that a Plankton shirt or an Ultra Man shirt?
[2:01:29] <savetitania> I think that's harder than in kof
[2:01:32] <+smitty_werb_> SHNASTY
[2:01:38] <savetitania> which is what gave sakurai the idea, most likely

[2:23:33] <christopherwpoindexter> @blond_e I think Woolz as Samus last time, then Reggie as Fox now

[2:26:37] <JayPastaForce> Obama chuckled: You mean the waveshine?
[2:26:38] <sonofthedeepsouth> Woolie said it is a fighting game
[2:26:38] <+blond_e> Most of Melee's tech is simple if you break it up.
[2:26:48] <%Skullgod> im gettjng toasted
[2:26:50] <Doublemint_Dave_> tech chasing is the best part of smash
[2:26:54] <ChansonNoire> I think there's also that dragoon item that makes the game turn into a raygun simulator
[2:26:54] <%DensityD> woolie wants to read the roll for breakfast
[2:26:58] <ShawnEXE> Yeah tech chasing is great
[2:26:58] <rcand9> WP

[2:28:23] <ShawnEXE> no I lied
[2:28:32] <ShawnEXE> there is 7 technically
[2:28:33] <+blond_e> @WoolieVersus Can reggie shield-drop? 👀

[2:30:07] <+ggbhtg> It may not look like it, but Falcon has many many chances to do a knee. Or not
[2:30:08] <%DensityD> what tier is mewtwo in?
[2:30:08] <kikoeru_san> stuffed
[2:30:11] <mobiusmartyr> Oof
[2:30:13] <ChansonNoire> bottom
[2:30:15] <%ElectricEmissary> bottom tier
[2:30:15] <%CaptainPileDriver> bottom
[2:30:17] <+blond_e> @DensityD Low/mid teir
[2:30:20] <%CaptainPileDriver> mewtwo in melee sucks
[2:30:23] <ShawnEXE> If woolie ever gets interested in getting good at melee he should try uncle punch
[2:30:26] <rcand9> i wanna see DR Reggie vs this falcon
[2:30:30] <+pkmamsters> this man playin f-zero while woolie's stuck in mario kart 8
[2:30:30] <ShawnEXE> if he doesn't already know about it
[2:30:32] <kikoeru_san> Mewtwo is bad, his entire tail is a hot box
[2:30:41] <ShawnEXE> mewtwo is probably the top of low tier
[2:30:41] <sunnythedrunk> Mewtwo is one of the better low tiers though, he's still bad overall but
[2:30:50] <+ggbhtg> The sex kick, Woolie!
[2:30:52] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @pkmamsters LUL
[2:30:52] <%Skullgod> everytime you fair, nair instead
[2:30:56] <%CaptainPileDriver> luigi is midtier yeah?
[2:31:03] <%Skullgod> luigi is high mid
[2:31:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> yeah i thought so
[2:31:10] <Spearweaver> m2 is low mid /high low
[2:31:12] <+ggbhtg> It's the sex kick, Wools!
[2:31:20] <ShawnEXE> luigi is high mid
[2:31:25] <rcand9> luigi was always my main but im GARBO
[2:31:28] <%DensityD> woolie needs to see the hitbox for samus nair
[2:31:31] <ShawnEXE> luigi's wavedash is the longest
[2:31:33] <ShawnEXE> it's so silly
[2:31:44] <%Skullgod> you go halfway across the stage with luigi wavedash
[2:31:44] <%CaptainPileDriver> luigi literally slides like it's ice on every stage with his wavedash
[2:31:48] <+ar4ndomblackguy> u see stick fighting videos are back in the form of osu?
[2:31:49] <Spearweaver> luigi is nutty
[2:31:50] <+ggbhtg> Darn, could've edge guarded with her D Smash a while ago
[2:31:53] <%DensityD> "you were cute" ????
[2:31:59] <halfmasks> ive only played brawl and ultimate, whats the deal with the CRT's for melee and how important is it?
[2:32:06] <ShawnEXE> You can definitely describe luigi as a slippery noodle
[2:32:11] <%AlteisenReiseZ> PLAY DANCERUSH STARDOM, A REAL RHYTHM GAME
[2:32:14] <+blond_e> @halfmasks Melee requires very low lag to play reliably
[2:32:17] <VJdarkworld> shoulder tackle
[2:32:17] <+ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus N-air has kill potential, too
[2:32:17] <christopherwpoindexter> @halfmasks no input lag?
[2:32:19] <$agoaj> LCDs have extra lag from upscaling the 480p signal
[2:32:19] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Yeah I’m salt
[2:32:23] <ChansonNoire> jasmin is a very cute man KappaPride
[2:32:23] <sonofthedeepsouth> quebecoirs
[2:32:31] <%CaptainPileDriver> @halfmasks it's the only tv that won't have any lag on the setup
[2:32:32] <ShawnEXE> I think the biggest thing to get used to in melee is the lack of a buffer whatsoever
[2:32:36] <%DensityD> slippi.gg giving that GOOD GOOD stats
[2:32:38] <ShawnEXE> in almost every game there's a buffer
[2:32:46] <%ExpressNode> I just now notice the lack of music
[2:32:55] <joylent_blue> lytFIRSTTRY lytFIRSTTRY lytFIRSTTRY
[2:32:55] <+ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus Reggie, got anything to say about the difference between damage and knockback potential in this game?
[2:32:55] <+Hayasage> GG
[2:32:57] <rcand9> gg
[2:33:16] <+Hayasage> I'm east coast btw. Virginia
[2:33:23] <halfmasks> theres literally no modern set up that can compare? wow, that must be a nightmare for TO's
[2:33:24] <%CaptainPileDriver> WHEN'S THE LUIGI UPPERCUTS also, i'm happy no jigglypuffs have shown up
[2:33:28] <powerprotoman> i just came back and now theres a piss filter?
[2:33:34] <joylent_blue> Link lytGULP
[2:33:40] <%CaptainPileDriver> @powerprotoman that's been there since second one
[2:33:44] <ShawnEXE> It's probably flux
[2:33:53] <ChansonNoire> bro the nair nair combo
[2:33:54] <+ggbhtg> @CaptainPileDriver I got a pocket Green Mario, but I prefer to play Green Mario instead.
[2:33:55] <ChansonNoire> fucking link lol
[2:33:56] <JetpackMcQuack> Constantly changing inputs
[2:33:59] <%DensityD> CANON! PogChamp
[2:33:59] <ShawnEXE> I think sheik can chain grab link lmao
[2:34:05] <ShawnEXE> definitely not canon
[2:34:13] <%DensityD> !coffeewolf
[2:34:20] <ShawnEXE> oh yeah
[2:34:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> @ggbhtg i used to main dr mario but i prefer normal mario just for the bit of extra range on his side smash
[2:34:25] <ShawnEXE> sheik can def chain grab
[2:34:26] <+blond_e> shiek can chaingrab most mid/low tiers
[2:34:28] <VJdarkworld> ganon canon
[2:34:41] <+ggbhtg> You may not think Link has tech in this game, but he do
[2:34:44] <rcand9> link must be mid but able to hold his own in top tier right chat?
[2:34:54] <WumFan64> Let fizzi finish
[2:34:55] <WumFan64> Please
[2:34:56] <joylent_blue> LUL
[2:34:56] <+Chronoreyer> link sucks
[2:34:59] <+ggbhtg> That's Yoshi's Woolie, it happens
[2:35:05] <+ggbhtg> That's the staaage
[2:35:08] <sunnythedrunk> Link can do some work vs top tiers
[2:35:14] <ChansonNoire> @rcand9 kinda, but no
[2:35:16] <+Chronoreyer> he's too slow
[2:35:22] <+ggbhtg> Get hit at the wrong time while doing a down air, that's a wrap
[2:35:32] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> somewhere, Harada-san is getting angry, without knowing why
[2:35:32] <+thackattack00> SFV
[2:35:34] <%DensityD> woolie has said this as well: "rollback will never NOT be good"
[2:35:37] <+Taglog7> UGH, I can't watch this game. Even tho I'm a scrub, I want to play!
[2:35:39] <%Skullgod> link is exactly mid tier
[2:35:42] <+ondri21> tekken wen they fucked it up
[2:35:42] <Zayasu> what about 3d fighting games?
[2:35:43] <sunnythedrunk> Young link just tends to outclass link so not many people play him
[2:35:47] <%Skullgod> like right in the middle
[2:35:52] <+blond_e> link is terrible. defiinitely low tier
[2:35:59] <+Chronoreyer> y link has better specific matchups
[2:36:02] <+Chronoreyer> link is better overall
[2:36:06] <ShawnEXE> rollback's only drawback is more processing power
[2:36:06] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:36:08] <%Struggleful> 904 PogChamp
[2:36:12] <ShawnEXE> and dev time
[2:36:13] <%Wool> Wool subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months! Waiting for the day the Project M/+ community somehow implements rollback so we get a GIFG.
[2:36:14] <+ggbhtg> This is likely the smallest stage of the tourney stages, so it gets sweaty easily
[2:36:14] <ShawnEXE> obviously
[2:36:19] <JetpackMcQuack> WutFace Waaah!
[2:36:27] <joylent_blue> LUL
[2:36:27] <%Skullgod> @Wool code it yourself

[2:36:40] <mobiusmartyr> Bruhhh
[2:36:51] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I remember my first Melee tournament, I played Link and got WASHED. Of course, I was 10 years old...
[2:36:54] <%Wool> @ggbhtg not anymore it ain't
[2:36:55] <mobiusmartyr> Real Link hours
[2:36:55] <%DensityD> and now we have solid snake in smash Ultimate
[2:36:57] <+ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus So can Samus, out of bomb drop
[2:37:07] <+alonerguy995> Is he playing online on Melee?
[2:37:11] <%Skullgod> oh god falco is the worst thing you can play against beginners
[2:37:15] <+ggbhtg> @alonerguy995 he be do
[2:37:17] <%Skullgod> besides icies
[2:37:35] <ShawnEXE> Yeah falco is probably the most broken character on paper
[2:37:38] <%DensityD> this is online melee through https://slippi.gg it is smashbros melee with rollback netcode
[2:37:39] <+alonerguy995> @ggbhtg that's badass
[2:37:40] <+ggbhtg> Shine spark Kappa

[2:38:06] <+ggbhtg> and Link....
[2:38:09] <%DensityD> THIS ONE WEIRD SECRET
[2:38:15] <%M3djedx> woolieYE
[2:38:18] <ShawnEXE> Like imagine if there was a fighting game where a character could throw out an almost instant projectile every 30 frames with nearly no drawback
[2:38:21] <JetpackMcQuack> like Takeshi's song
[2:38:21] <+ggbhtg> well, we know all the glitches in OOT now, so that's canon too
[2:38:32] <RunoEddie> how terrible is Mario in general? never see him get any play in Melee
[2:38:32] <christopherwpoindexter> generous *hitbox,* more like catchbox?
[2:38:39] <%M3djedx> hboxStonks
[2:38:44] <+ggbhtg> Reggie messed up a laser input, looks like
[2:38:47] <%Skullgod> both marios are midtier runo
[2:38:51] <sunnythedrunk> So Woolie hates ultimate LUL
[2:38:53] <halfmasks> youd think they make the bros the shotos
[2:38:54] <%Skullgod> a bit higher thank link and young link probably
[2:38:55] <Spearweaver> Mario is meh
[2:38:57] <ShawnEXE> Yeah Doc is considered better
[2:38:57] <Spearweaver> mid tier
[2:39:02] <ShawnEXE> Doc was once high tier
[2:39:02] <sonofthedeepsouth> SENTLY MASH
[2:39:05] <JKIMBUTTERS> Doc Mario a little better than Mario
[2:39:07] <ShawnEXE> but people got better

[2:39:42] <%Struggleful> As a Dizzy main I was spending half the match trying to mash out of stun while I was learning...
[2:39:52] <rcand9> i could watch reggie play melee all day
[2:40:09] <+ggbhtg> UFO, where did you goooo
[2:40:10] <+blond_e> How long has reggie played melee?
[2:40:12] <Mucmaster> It's the kind of thing where beginners like to mash buttons. Its fun to hit things. Mashing becomes annoying as you get into higher levels of play though
[2:40:12] <%DensityD> woolie hates bangers and mash, he will never eat it

[2:41:49] <joylent_blue> oh god this match up
[2:41:58] <ShawnEXE> This matchup is so brutal
[2:42:05] <+BruceyG> brutal for who
[2:42:12] <Melchior_the_Wise> Who's Player 1?
[2:42:13] <JetpackMcQuack> marth mains bro kinamaSmug
[2:42:13] <+ggbhtg> @BruceyG Yes
[2:42:14] <sunnythedrunk> Reggie is so Canadian, apologizing whenever he messes up LUL
[2:42:17] <+BruceyG> i see
[2:42:25] <joylent_blue> for us trying to keep track of the characters lytFIRSTTRY
[2:42:26] <ShawnEXE> It's basically marth juggling falcon forever but then falcon touches marth once and marth is dead
[2:42:30] <%DensityD> who is statistically advantaged in Falcon Vs Marth?
[2:42:31] <%Scrambledjay> Scrambledjay subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[2:42:32] <rcand9> reggie loves melee because no bars to waste
[2:42:35] <%DensityD> lets assume we are the melee gods
[2:42:36] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Who's playing for Woolie?
[2:42:40] <+ggbhtg> @DensityD Yes.
[2:42:45] <ShawnEXE> At top level marth wins
[2:42:46] <ShawnEXE> 100%
[2:42:49] <sunnythedrunk> THE WARRIOR
[2:42:55] <halfmasks> WHAT A MADMAN
[2:42:57] <%LastHazzerd> bless
[2:42:59] <%HostilePoundcakes> LUL
[2:43:00] <ShawnEXE> at mid level falcon wins
[2:43:03] <joylent_blue> Admiral_PopnFresh reggie's been at the wheel the last few matches
[2:43:03] <VJdarkworld> ganon kinda schmovin
[2:43:05] <%Jetzord> What a legend
[2:43:05] <+blond_e> @DensityD Marth by a LONG shot

[2:43:34] <slamview> PogChamp
[2:43:36] <ChansonNoire> @WoolieVersus suggest to fizzi a training mode while in queue :)
[2:43:42] <ShawnEXE> Basically falcon is a much easier character to learn the combo and punish game
[2:43:48] <rcand9> reggie showing us what falcon is all about
[2:43:49] <%DensityD> what is the "punch girl" for Fizzi?
[2:43:50] <ShawnEXE> but marth has a better neutral game
[2:43:57] <halfmasks> I love anyone who talks unironically like Ryu but only when its out of the blue
[2:44:00] <sonofthedeepsouth> can we have a wombo combo
[2:44:02] <%DensityD> nah play puff tho
[2:44:14] <Admiral_PopnFresh> LUL
[2:44:18] <ShawnEXE> so theoretically at top level their punish games are nearly the same but marth has a better neutral
[2:44:19] <+BruceyG> seeing sick shit for sure. or love for the character if they are not directly from the game
[2:44:29] <sosuke5> or boss characters...
[2:44:29] <+Taglog7> Who got da titties?

[2:47:12] <+ggbhtg> We livin
[2:47:17] <christopherwpoindexter> @halfmasks that made me think of the lyrics from the Outkast song "Ms. Jackson" LUL
[2:47:27] <ShawnEXE> like in a casual match you could theoretically spam falco lasers
[2:47:27] <+Lizard0TM> Did Woolie neglect to shower for this stream?
[2:47:32] <+ggbhtg> What about against jump in laser
[2:47:32] <Admiral_PopnFresh> almost a lucky dash kill
[2:47:34] <+ggbhtg> yep
[2:47:37] <ShawnEXE> and the other person would just be at the mercy
[2:47:38] <$SilverRoddo> Swarmy fox as always!

[2:47:47] <sonofthedeepsouth> yoooo

[2:48:23] <ShawnEXE> Melee will never die
[2:48:24] <joylent_blue> lytFIRSTTRY lytBADMAN
[2:48:28] <ShawnEXE> especially with rollback now
[2:48:28] <Smoofmaster> where is woogie right now? he could probably play a pro if he wanted
[2:48:37] <%DensityD> but now, thanks to rollback netcode, we can truely be closer to "ready to react to that"
[2:48:39] <christopherwpoindexter> PogChamp
[2:48:40] <halfmasks> your top tiers wont stop you from getting BODIED
[2:48:41] <+ThePayphone> i wish samus was as sick in any other smash game as she was in project M
[2:48:49] <sonofthedeepsouth> FEED REGGIE
[2:48:54] <Smoofmaster> Samus is sick in melee
[2:48:56] <%DensityD> REGGIE IS FED
[2:48:59] <christopherwpoindexter> PJSalt
[2:49:04] <joylent_blue> woolie typos this stream: woobie, woogie
[2:49:05] <+ggbhtg> Melee wishes it added features like that, nah
[2:49:09] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> !motivated
[2:49:09] <@Moobot> 1506 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[2:49:10] <ShawnEXE> if anything the only thing bringing melee down is the fact it's so old so it feels hard to keep up with people with decades on this game
[2:49:22] <+ggbhtg> So Tekken LUL
[2:49:28] <%DensityD> wootie wootie wootie wootie
[2:49:34] <+ThePayphone> @Smoofmaster she decent for sure but prject M samus played by esam is a whole nother level of raw hype
[2:49:43] <%DensityD> almost 19 years old
[2:49:45] <+ggbhtg> @ShawnEXE So it's Tekken?
[2:49:46] <christopherwpoindexter> Chiquer Zelda...Sheik or zelda....
[2:49:47] <rcand9> can the fans take reggie 2-0
[2:49:53] <Doublemint_Dave_> @ShawnEXE that's in all fighting games but I will admit it feels very extreme for melee
[2:49:55] <ShawnEXE> Yeah exactly
[2:50:02] <ShawnEXE> Yeah I suppose that's for most fighting games
[2:50:12] <%DensityD> Japanese players, one character, forever
[2:50:13] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1287839400034996227?s=20
[2:50:14] <ShawnEXE> since fighting game fundies carry over to alot
[2:50:16] <halfmasks> unfortunately melee cant add a Leroy Smith to let newbies survive pools
[2:50:17] <+ggbhtg> I mean, I do play Tekken against competitive, and I've played this in tourney as well.
[2:50:20] <Doublemint_Dave_> Try getting into marvel when theres killers everywhere
[2:50:22] <Smoofmaster> The literal best player in the world right now started playing over a decade after it came out. Zain is streaming right now
[2:50:34] <joylent_blue> LUL
[2:50:37] <sunnythedrunk> LUL
[2:50:37] <%DensityD> PogChamp CAN'T COUNTER PICK PogChamp
[2:50:38] <Admiral_PopnFresh> god damn, Reggie
[2:50:39] <rcand9> reggie plz
[2:50:48] <ShawnEXE> right but zain has still been playing for over 5 years and he's one person
[2:50:50] <ChansonNoire> hbox started playing a long time ago...
[2:50:54] <%DensityD> wait, I'm wrong, aren't I?
[2:50:56] <sonofthedeepsouth> CMON GUYS WHERE ARE THE KILLERS
[2:50:58] <sunnythedrunk> PogChamp
[2:51:00] <ShawnEXE> but that's also why unrated matchmaking is so good
[2:51:01] <+ggbhtg> Years of EXP isn't everything, killers can appear out of no where
[2:51:02] <sunnythedrunk> Reggie is saucin
[2:51:07] <%jiggy_snipe> Reggie is the killer lol
[2:51:08] <sonofthedeepsouth> Where are the Kilers in chat to bring back order
[2:51:08] <Admiral_PopnFresh> and here I thought the momentum started against him
[2:51:10] <sunnythedrunk> nvm LUL
[2:51:11] <ShawnEXE> let's you find players of all skills
[2:51:13] <+ggbhtg> @sonofthedeepsouth Sorry, this time Reggie IS the killer
[2:51:14] <rcand9> i wanna see dr reggie again
[2:51:14] <halfmasks> reggie is styling and profiling
[2:51:17] <%DensityD> TIME FOR WOBBLES
[2:51:18] <%Wool> I don't wanna wobble
[2:51:21] <+GalacticaPhanto> wobbles baybeee
[2:51:29] <%Skullgod> i'll wobble
[2:51:30] <%Skullgod> dont test me
[2:51:30] <ShawnEXE> no one picks ice climbers cause they're the villains of smash
[2:51:32] <joylent_blue> come on reggie, show us lytEYES
[2:51:32] <+pkmamsters> "You got an iceclimber?" Reggie: *noise of digust*
[2:51:35] <%Skullgod> i know how to count at 200 bpm
[2:51:40] <2DSuperiority> i'm getting wobbled in my favorite game help
[2:51:42] <Mucmaster> Yeah yeah yeah. Keep that filthy wobbling in there
[2:51:45] <Smoofmaster> wobbling is banned in almost all rulesets atm
[2:51:45] <%DensityD> a niceclimber
[2:51:51] <Smoofmaster> its just not enforced online
[2:51:54] <+ggbhtg> 200 bpm? Get this Air Gear nonsense outta here.
[2:51:56] <Smoofmaster> because how could you
[2:52:03] <ShawnEXE> @WoolieVersus Actually a common problem ice climber players and puff players are facing is that everyone quits out the moment they see them since matchmaking is so fast
[2:52:06] <halfmasks> reggie pls
[2:52:18] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I know they "fixed" this stage with no transformations, but I love those stupid shenanigans
[2:52:23] <drhivesphd> wait woolie playing maylay?

[2:52:33] <+pkmamsters> speedrun tech
[2:52:35] <ChansonNoire> @WoolieVersus tell Fizzi to add training mode while in queue, or ask if its possible :(
[2:52:41] <BlackermanZX> no one wants to play aganist puff? cowardice
[2:52:45] <rcand9> poor ice climbers mains
[2:52:49] <christopherwpoindexter> @pkmamsters SAME LUL
[2:52:49] <%SirGO0SE> "no one wants to play with me? :("
[2:52:49] <Spearweaver> quit the moment you see puff
[2:52:51] <townzzzzz> smash players the new LTG
[2:52:52] <2DSuperiority> don't shake Jigglypuff players hands, don't look at Jigglypuff players
[2:53:18] <rcand9> sure
[2:53:26] <christopherwpoindexter> i wouldn't mind playing against, I just would rather not play AS ice climber
[2:53:27] <+ggbhtg> Is the way to reset the same as in vanilla Melee?
[2:53:27] <rcand9> a real unranked mode
[2:53:37] <%SirGO0SE> woolieFUN should be woolieFUN :) good philosophy
[2:53:39] <Doublemint_Dave_> woolie pls stop being hung up on "friendlies" lol
[2:53:39] <%DensityD> WHAT A NAME, "FRIENDLIES"
[2:53:40] <Smoofmaster> its also important to be able to leave on the rare occurance of a bad connection
[2:53:43] <joylent_blue> there ARE NO FRIENDLIES lytBADMAN
[2:53:54] <%DensityD> what is "friendlies" in French?
[2:53:55] <+ggbhtg> Friendly Fire, y'know?
[2:53:59] <$agoaj> LP Funzies mode
[2:54:01] <rcand9> lmao
[2:54:02] <sonofthedeepsouth> Casul
[2:54:06] <%DensityD> woolieFUN
[2:54:07] <christopherwpoindexter> FRIENDLY DEATH, PACIFISM
[2:54:10] <Admiral_PopnFresh> 50/50, are gonna play a Climbers player who is practicing wobbling? or are you gonna pay a Climbers player practicing specifically without wobbling?
[2:54:21] <sonofthedeepsouth> friendlies? you mean locals
[2:54:21] <drhivesphd> the only friendlies are friendly fire
[2:54:28] <rcand9> gotta love mike he plays stealth games now
[2:54:38] <+ggbhtg> Doubles has to have Friendly Fire turned on, therefore Friendlies. @WoolieVersus
[2:54:40] <+pkmamsters> "friendly this, you fucking casual"
[2:54:41] <sonofthedeepsouth> Mike is back?
[2:54:49] <sonofthedeepsouth> Why noone old me
[2:54:49] <rcand9> yeah mike is super back
[2:54:55] <%DensityD> how do I play online melee with rollback netcode......with items on?
[2:54:56] <%jiggy_snipe> Nintendo
[2:54:57] <%DensityD> 4Head
[2:54:57] <VJdarkworld> rival codes
[2:55:08] <christopherwpoindexter> go, go, go go Mike. go, go, gogo Mike (que the WarioWare song)
[2:55:09] <+Casual_Nopon> Nemesis codes
[2:55:16] <sonofthedeepsouth> Miek Russ
[2:55:18] <RastoJJ> if friendlies was the "normal" term and "casuals" was the smash term everyone would be like "CaSuAls???????"
[2:55:23] <+pkmamsters> Mike "Mike Ross" Ross was there to show off the EVO 2020 lineup
[2:55:24] <ShawnEXE> The transformation time is not invincible and super long
[2:55:28] <%Skullgod> its transfomring back is the problem @wooli
[2:55:29] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Archfoe Codes
[2:55:29] <ShawnEXE> so you can do it offstage
[2:55:32] <drhivesphd> whats the difference of melee fox and falco?
[2:55:34] <+AllenAfro> Am I crazy or is the screen dark
[2:55:37] <Mr_Strut> hot
[2:55:37] <+ggbhtg> The Zelda teleport can be read easier too, imo
[2:55:37] <%Skullgod> its transfomring back is the problem @WoolieVersus
[2:55:39] <ShawnEXE> so many differences
[2:55:44] <+Rafraud> how long is queue?
[2:55:48] <%SirGO0SE> the only pressure Zelda gives me is in my pants
[2:55:50] <%DensityD> dark mode rise up
[2:56:04] <Admiral_PopnFresh> that Mango-esque SD
[2:56:05] <+ggbhtg> That's that good shit Reggie!
[2:56:10] <ShawnEXE> they might look like they have the same moves but all the moves have slightly different properties
[2:56:10] <jsocks654> ggs

[2:58:01] <christopherwpoindexter> lugii in this game is literally just a pitch shift in voice clips-OH MY GOD G&W?!
[2:58:10] <Mucmaster> Sex Kick
[2:58:14] <Smoofmaster> Samus' fullstage wavedash is really hard
[2:58:22] <Mr_Strut> sex kick?
[2:58:28] <ShawnEXE> sex kicks in this games are mostly combo breakers
[2:58:29] <%DensityD> beep beep beep
[2:58:29] <Smoofmaster> it comes out frame 3
[2:58:31] <+ggbhtg> Luigi's N-air is NUTZ
[2:58:32] <Viewtiful_Rose> The super wave dash is dumb
[2:58:34] <%DensityD> GET THAT 9
[2:58:37] <%DensityD> PRAY FOR 9
[2:58:40] <Smoofmaster> only shine comes out frame 1

[2:58:47] <+ar4ndomblackguy> ending the stream vs a noob i see Kappa
[2:58:56] <2DSuperiority> coward Sakurai won't put Sex Kick in the ingame tips
[2:58:58] <rcand9> sex kicks are always a fuckin thrill when people say them irl
[2:58:59] <ShawnEXE> yeah shine comes out frame 1 and is invincible on frame 1 only
[2:59:00] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Nice no contact kill
[2:59:00] <Jrocy247> Why is the screen in some weird coloring???
[2:59:01] <@Squdnate> They say game & watch, but it's more like watch & die
[2:59:03] <RastoJJ> sex kick is a lingering hitbox on neutral air that gets weaker as the move stays out
[2:59:07] <christopherwpoindexter> didn't mean to lead ya on, but thx SeemsGood
[2:59:09] <%DensityD> SAUSAGES

[2:59:36] <Arek_1> @Jrocy247 Same.
[2:59:37] <ShawnEXE> the tint is def flux or something
[2:59:38] <%Struggleful> Debit Card
[2:59:40] <+ggbhtg> Maybe somebody should ACTUALLY play the G&W game it's based on LUL
[2:59:40] <Arek_1> Sausages.
[2:59:45] <%DensityD> DORF
[2:59:46] <JetpackMcQuack> Bacon's the only meat that zig zags

[3:04:54] <Jrocy247> *you
[3:04:56] <+Hayasage> I used to run Melee on my laptop and set it up in my school's cafeteria
[3:04:58] <ChansonNoire> @WoolieVersus bro ask fizzi if it would be possible to queue while in training mode or if its on the roadmap
[3:05:02] <KnivesEve> @WoolieVersus first time reading vagabond. its great artwork and story
[3:05:03] <+Rafraud> my main game is PM but it's deadish now
[3:05:04] <%Wool> 3.6 is the last PM before switching to P+
[3:05:08] <VJdarkworld> now its on P+
[3:05:09] <$agoaj> Do a Brawl- episode For Fun instead
[3:05:09] <rcand9> reggie is a dabbler
[3:05:10] <+DarkJayGame> I love you guys
[3:05:11] <sunnythedrunk> I need Woolie to see P+ Knuckles
[3:05:12] <+Hayasage> I'd just get people playing melee against each other and they'd try to beat me
[3:05:14] <craniusmaximus2> It's got Knuckles in it now.
[3:05:17] <%DensityD> just take a shot everytime "*blank* is fucking sick"
[3:05:17] <ThisGuy198> 2.6!! broooooo that was like 10 years ago LUL
[3:05:17] <Doublemint_Dave_> P+ bowser is sick
[3:05:17] <Viewtiful_Rose> It’s really fucking good I’d love to see an episode on it. They just made a new version with PLAYABLE Knuckles
[3:05:27] <2DSuperiority> Sami in Project M would have been the SICKEST SHIT
[3:05:33] <rcand9> roll back real life
[3:05:43] <JetpackMcQuack> Do it yourself cyr5Head
[3:05:43] <+ggbhtg> It's not exactly transferrable tech
[3:05:44] <%DensityD> a passion project you say? woolieT
[3:05:54] <+ggbhtg> it ain't one to one coding
[3:05:57] <Pizza_Mezza> Classic smash rehydrated
[3:06:02] <ThisGuy198> brawl modding is pretty sick tbh
[3:06:02] <%DensityD> woolieS woolieT
[3:06:02] <+ggbhtg> coding never is
[3:06:04] <%DensityD> woolieF woolieU
[3:06:21] <rcand9> roll back is a blessing from godlike coders
[3:06:45] <+Hayasage> I wish I could play Xrd or +R online without all the struggle
[3:06:46] <ChansonNoire> third strike online
[3:06:49] <%agoaj> agoaj subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:06:49] <+ggbhtg> Alpha ONE had it right! @WoolieVersus
[3:06:50] <ChansonNoire> was the first
[3:06:54] <+ggbhtg> Alpha ONE
[3:06:59] <%DensityD> QoL struggle
[3:07:11] <fangovafang> finally got my medicine VoHiYo VoHiYo VoHiYo
[3:07:11] <ThisGuy198> omg Brawl Minus for fun would be siiiiiiiiiiick
[3:07:17] <VJdarkworld> the delay based union
[3:07:20] <Arek_1> Wasn't HD Remix the first?
[3:07:27] <%DensityD> woolie, if you didn't have these struggles, would you even really have FGC?
[3:07:33] <%jiggy_snipe> there's no excuse not to copy each other
[3:07:36] <Arek_1> Or nah, MvC2 on last gen.
[3:07:38] <+ggbhtg> inb4 it's JP only, no translaters, and they just talk about how great the brands are
[3:07:45] <+ggbhtg> please don't
[3:07:49] <+ggbhtg> don't be that
[3:07:54] <%DensityD> I'll keep putting my foot in my mouth until god strikes me down
[3:07:58] <%SirGO0SE> I want GBVS Rollback so bad
[3:08:01] <GeltonZ> XD @ggbhtg You know what's up.
[3:08:16] <JetpackMcQuack> Absolutely
[3:08:30] <+ggbhtg> Gotta wait for the Riot Games fighter, huh...
[3:08:32] <JetpackMcQuack> And Apex is alive and well
[3:08:35] <ThisGuy198> very smash fan should experience Brawl minus imo
[3:08:35] <%DensityD> I don't play Brawlhalla, what netcode does Brawlhalla have?
[3:08:36] <%Skullgod> imagine playing apex
[3:08:41] <+ggbhtg> We still need to get universal crossplay...
[3:08:43] <%DensityD> Bintendo Bire Bhis Ban
[3:09:12] <ThisGuy198> brallhalla has rollback iirc
[3:09:13] <%DensityD> with blackjack, and hookers
[3:09:13] <@Squdnate> Remember when you had to play the game multiple times to have the characters
[3:09:14] <+ggbhtg> Reminder that only Power Rangers Grid has universal crossplay
[3:09:32] <GeltonZ> @DensityD "What's that? Ban this? Okay!" -Nintendo
[3:09:33] <JetpackMcQuack> I think it's slowly happening
[3:09:33] <+ggbhtg> @Squdnate But now games cost too much to make
[3:09:42] <ChansonNoire> bro ask fizzi about being in queue in training mode, if its possible :(
[3:09:48] <rcand9> it was nice seeing reggie play a game he loves too.
[3:09:49] <%SirGO0SE> 2f entire time
[3:09:54] <%DensityD> Fintendo Fire this Fan

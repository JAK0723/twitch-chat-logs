[0:02:58] <+zanzibar_junker> Keep on Keeping on Woolie
[0:03:12] <MetalDeerS0LID> I've learned to just check the stream because the notification is always not the actual game
[0:03:15] <sparkly_yoyo> And don't drop those pizzas
[0:03:17] <@Menitta> Ok I guess that doesn't work

[0:04:58] <CuteDad69> im here for EVA 01
[0:04:59] <zenith0111> Welcome to the Woolie Hole.
[0:05:06] <worldbrand> that's valid. those are both valid
[0:05:20] <+kingfisher_games> Who’s hype for game awards tonight?
[0:05:23] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> SourPls
[0:05:26] <zenith0111> Not me
[0:05:33] <+kingfisher_games> Fire Emblem is currently crushing the Player’s Choice
[0:05:34] <CuteDad69> im hype for shick-bots reappearance
[0:05:36] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Look at all these people that are way more talented than me
[0:05:37] <zenith0111> I can't wait for the ads tho calebPog
[0:05:39] <sparkly_yoyo> I expect dissapointment and 1 good thing
[0:05:39] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> is woolie streaming that tonight?
[0:05:40] <+kingfisher_games> 45% of the vote
[0:05:45] <worldbrand> yee haw im anticipating some announcements but i dunno what
[0:06:01] <dabeaminator> I'm hyped for the likelihood of a Smash DLC announcement.
[0:06:04] <CuteDad69> Woolie's streaming Death stranding Twwice, then gameawards isnt he?
[0:06:17] <zenith0111> Popularity Contest calebPog
[0:06:18] <sparkly_yoyo> Best case scenario we good some cool new shit and a BAFFLING Smash newcomer
[0:06:19] <@Menitta> Sonic Adventure Remake obviously Kappa
[0:06:20] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Jump Force for best fighting game 201o Kappa
[0:06:27] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> *2019
[0:06:28] <sparkly_yoyo> Get*
[0:06:34] <worldbrand> I think so but he'll probably reclarify real quick before we start?
[0:06:36] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> If jump force doesn't win we ALL lose
[0:06:51] <worldbrand> What if they announced sonic adventure 4
[0:06:52] <+kingfisher_games> @worldbrand I’m making a guess: smash 5th dlc fighter, outer worlds switch release date, outer worlds story DLC announcement,
[0:06:58] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Jump Force winning will be the event of the decade
[0:07:03] <CuteDad69> new smash dlc char is just sonic again
[0:07:07] <+linSP> this just in, death stranding wins all categories
[0:07:13] <KuroCherries> Did I miss it or has it not started yet?
[0:07:20] <sparkly_yoyo> Best fighting game: Leroy Smith. Not Tekken, just Leroy.
[0:07:23] <worldbrand> Not started
[0:07:24] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @KuroCherries just starting
[0:07:25] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:07:26] <+Prevot> they gonna announce Mario Odyssey 2
[0:07:28] <KuroCherries> cool!
[0:07:31] <dabeaminator> Death Stranding is going to win just because people worship Kojima.
[0:07:50] <sparkly_yoyo> I'd actually like classic Sonic in Smash, but that's CONTROVERSIAL
[0:07:51] <+kingfisher_games> @dabeaminator I think DS is going to win best direction
[0:07:57] <CuteDad69> Speaking of death stranding, how did Jenkins NOT get a nomination for Die Hardman
[0:07:58] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> It also has a guy called Die Hardman in it
[0:07:59] <Arek_1> Mobile notification said streaming "Ulti-" *cut off* UMvC3?
[0:08:07] <dabeaminator> Like, it's a decent game, but it isn't game of the year material for me.
[0:08:11] <sparkly_yoyo> There should be a Weird Shit category just for DS
[0:08:13] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> YO but that babylon's fall trailer thou
[0:08:36] <worldbrand> I'm excited for babylons fall but i was hoping itd be more fleshed out than what we saw
[0:08:39] <sparkly_yoyo> I like the boldness in making a game so out there with such a budget, but then again it's not like anyone other than Kojima has the chance
[0:08:44] <CuteDad69> tbf i think DS is the best one out of the other nominees
[0:08:55] <zayasu> HahaCat
[0:08:55] <zenith0111> What's Babylons Fall like?
[0:08:55] <sparkly_yoyo> Babylon looks blandylon
[0:08:58] <NotHereToStream> no dmc5 tho
[0:09:07] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @zenith0111 like a platinum game
[0:09:11] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Death Stranding is the The Last Jedi of Metal Gear
[0:09:13] <CuteDad69> DMC 5 is up for best soundtrack

[0:25:38] <CuteDad69> nah
[0:25:41] <+linSP> i thought people played mobas for the vore
[0:25:41] <%Lion_kun> It got best action game.
[0:25:41] <SunPraiser> no
[0:25:42] <sparkly_yoyo> For music at least
[0:25:47] <CuteDad69> its up for best action and OST
[0:25:48] <sparkly_yoyo> and action
[0:25:54] <@Solidus_113> There is a character who literally gets bigger as he eats enemies. Name's Cho'Gath
[0:25:59] <+ggbhtg> TOP FED TOP KEK
[0:26:02] <@Menitta> Jedi Fallen Order is fucking rad
[0:26:09] <dabeaminator> That's awful. The game awards are a joke though, so I guess it doesn't matter.
[0:26:17] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Theres actually a character in League that literally vores you and spits you out
[0:26:24] <CuteDad69> its still nice to see DMC 5 get ANY attention
[0:26:25] <%Lion_kun> Jedi Fallen Order is a good game that could be great if not for EA bullshit.
[0:26:46] <@Menitta> It is great tho
[0:26:52] <%hntronium> Plague host
[0:26:52] <biomegabear> RAID FROM PLAUGE
[0:26:58] <duathadruid> plague raid
[0:26:59] <darkbotle> Hello from Plagues stream :)
[0:27:00] <dabeaminator> Hi plague
[0:27:01] <%Lion_kun> I got the PS4 version and I had to suffer my fair share of bugs, stuttering and even the game having to load assets.
[0:27:12] <+karldeck> I miss the guys animations
[0:27:16] <@Solidus_113> Old Joseph
[0:27:19] <sparkly_yoyo> The VGA are a joke, everyone just cares about the announcements. Pretending to be the Oscars is pathetic. The thuggery and childishness of games are the spiciness that give them life.
[0:27:22] <%Lion_kun> Also bad loading times and unresponsive controls.
[0:27:23] <redwilt> Iggy
[0:27:24] <KingHyperbole> Josuke wouldn't even realize
[0:27:27] <+Prevot> Joseph would use hamon on the liquid diarrhea
[0:27:28] <+karldeck> They did amazing animation of it
[0:27:28] <KingHyperbole> Okuyasu*
[0:27:28] <CuteDad69> joseph
[0:27:30] <KingHyperbole> brain fart
[0:27:30] <sparkly_yoyo> SHIT IS NOT CRASH
[0:27:31] <T_Sasquatch> That is pure power and I'd love a low stakes highschool level villain like that
[0:27:33] <Haarute> yeyeye part 5
[0:27:33] <+ggbhtg> Buurown NOTTO
[0:27:34] <duathadruid> Jotaro would definitely shit his pants if it was to spite his enemy
[0:27:35] <dabeaminator> Jotaro can stop time and just take it out.
[0:27:38] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Part 5 is the BEST
[0:27:43] <Jathspuh> KappaPride
[0:27:45] <%GeneralSCPatton> Josuke would unshit himself with Crazy Diamond
[0:27:46] <Haarute> part 5 is so much fun.
[0:27:47] <T_Sasquatch> Italian Twinks
[0:27:50] <%Lion_kun> I want Part 6. Gimme my queen.
[0:27:56] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Melone is husbando
[0:27:57] <sparkly_yoyo> 15 year olds dude
[0:27:57] <CuteDad69> waiting for part 7
[0:28:00] <%hntronium> I fucking hate those clothers
[0:28:01] <MSN04_Sazabi> Gappy would probably not give a single shred of a fuck about shitting his pants
[0:28:07] <+linSP> part 5 best twinks
[0:28:07] <UmjackTah> Giorno would just ignore it, he drinks piss no problem
[0:28:08] <%hntronium> They give me a massive headache
[0:28:14] <Jathspuh> @GeneralSCPatton he can't use crazy diamond on himself D:
[0:28:17] <%hntronium> Too many holes
[0:28:17] <%CappuccinoGuil> WAIT WHAT!
[0:28:20] <SocialMisfitGamer> Get ready for Everything to be taken out of context
[0:28:20] <T_Sasquatch> @lion_kun are you speaking of the correct Queen tho
[0:28:20] <CuteDad69> giorno would turn it into a snake
[0:28:24] <%CappuccinoGuil> I WAS JUST JOKING!
[0:28:29] <dabeaminator> @MSN04_Sazabi Joshu would be into it.
[0:28:34] <%Lion_kun> Jolyne is my Queen.

[0:58:33] <CuteDad69> but on the subject of DMC5 Vergil using Yamato to TP is cool as fuck
[0:58:34] <Milo_Oda> @cymen90 that shit with the sabers was dope AF
[0:59:19] <+Prevot> why does bezos have to look so evil tho
[0:59:21] <+Cymen90> @Milo_Oda Dude, the intro alone got my so hyped back in the day. SOULLESS MACHINE! YOU STRIKE THE SON OF ODIN!?

[1:00:39] <CuteDad69> @jinking79 it works in instances
[1:00:48] <%GeneralSCPatton> Speaking of teleports, Deadpool should be way deadlier, because he can telefrag your brain with his arm and then grow a new one.
[1:00:49] <ovan20> LUL
[1:00:52] <+Cymen90> WTF
[1:00:57] <zamzoph> I had an abandoned truck directly in front of the prepper in the narrow canyon :|

[1:01:02] <+Cymen90> I have NEVER seen this kinda gameplay
[1:01:08] <+Prevot> LUL
[1:01:10] <CuteDad69> telefragging is the best tp effect
[1:01:29] <%QaizerArt> @linSP I just literally push them off the roads, the doors are more annoying cause you gotta manually move em
[1:01:30] <+Cymen90> WTF are you doing, INDEED
[1:01:37] <CuteDad69> I've only seen Pat play this game perfectly, never seen a bad polaythrough

[1:21:53] <tag545> believe in the zipline
[1:22:00] <CuteDad69> CHEAT IS FED
[1:22:01] <+Cymen90> @WoolieVersus Have you ever considered an editor for bumble-compilations?
[1:22:04] <CuteDad69> Chat*
[1:22:12] <+Grayhammatter> chat got fed
[1:22:16] <SunPraiser> so this is DIO's World...
[1:22:17] <+AbnormalVoid> Just make sure the bumbling is interesting and funny and there's no problem, have fun with it, do the big joke
[1:22:17] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> is this was the world feels like
[1:22:25] <DatAsuna> Maybe call it a "Side-Op" episode?
[1:22:28] <+tuchpi> good :)
[1:22:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> Chat isn't just fed, chat is full
[1:22:46] <smugjorgen98> what chapter hes in
[1:22:47] <sparkly_yoyo> I'd say cut it and put it up in a way it feels like an extra
[1:22:47] <gunsrlove> @WoolieVersus Why the LP kayfabe and not just cut the stream up and upload stream parts with chat and talks and all
[1:22:48] <Milo_Oda> Sausage DansGame im vegetarian
[1:22:51] <SunPraiser> top is fed
[1:22:54] <cajjunb> hey whats up woolie, good to see ya streaming!
[1:23:08] <+D00msDayDan> BTs are fed as fuck
[1:23:23] <gunsrlove> They refuse the future
[1:23:31] <+Cymen90> They deny the future
[1:23:35] <CuteDad69> wait has woolie FED the BTs yet??
[1:23:35] <Jathspuh> Yeah. That makes sense
[1:23:43] <SunPraiser> but the future refused to change...
[1:23:44] <favadem> put chat o screen
[1:23:49] <vVAstrAVv> yeah i et that
[1:23:52] <zayasu> LP boomers cmonBruh
[1:23:58] <+tuchpi> chat on screen is a terrible idea
[1:24:00] <+Cymen90> Big boomer opinions
[1:24:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> Put a time stamp at the start of the video saying "This is where the bumbling stops guys"
[1:24:20] <+paladinstarbuster> Chat on screen would be cool if people could be cool
[1:24:33] <+Cymen90> Yeah, then people would know why you are suddenly turning around to pick up missed items LUL
[1:24:37] <Milo_Oda> itll be an entire episode of bumbles
[1:24:38] <SunPraiser> I'm saying keep it but if it's poorly recieved I said to cut it and nobody listened
[1:24:38] <%ECRead> so we starting a Crusade against the YouTube crowd? ...cause I'm down for a Crusade or two doodDoom
[1:24:47] <+tuchpi> no one wants to see randos talking during, especially if its a slow chat
[1:24:47] <sparkly_yoyo> @WoolieVersus I think cutting it up as 16.5 would make people feel like extra content instead of timewasting
[1:24:53] <gunsrlove> CONTENT RACE WAR
[1:24:59] <SunPraiser> finally
[1:25:02] <+Cymen90> Alright, so we start a war with your YT base now?

[1:32:08] <CuteDad69> hasnt been long enough to establish deep lore yet
[1:32:25] <sparkly_yoyo> @WoolieVersus focus on the engineer, just trust me
[1:32:25] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1204820081542402050?s=19
[1:32:37] <%supersugoisenpai1> Definitely start with the engineer
[1:33:53] <+Cymen90> Because you are not using them at all.....which you should.
[1:34:02] <+D00msDayDan> PCCs can't ever build vehicles
[1:34:05] <+theAncopro> i mean they're useless until the chiral network is up
[1:34:05] <+tuchpi> finally ditching pccs PogChamp
[1:34:07] <vVAstrAVv> pccs will become incredibly useful soon
[1:34:08] <sparkly_yoyo> vehicles are fabricated
[1:34:40] <honeyman18> You'll know when you get buildings that are worth making
[1:34:45] <derap41> You're not building shit yet?
[1:35:08] <+D00msDayDan> @WoolieVersus you can only build vehicles at garages, PCCs cannot
[1:35:15] <vVAstrAVv> once you unlock timefall shelters youll want at least 2 on you
[1:35:16] <DasFreekman> soon Willie Nelson soon we'll be truckin
[1:35:22] <+Cymen90> @WoolieVersus Think of the other players. Learn how to recognize places in need of structures.
[1:35:32] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> YEAH TRUCKIN'
[1:35:38] <+linSP> pccs get more structures unlocked as you go

[1:36:32] <sparkly_yoyo> @RamenRiderZ you might think it's a joke, but some people won't use the social features because they don't want to entruste deliveries to others. Mules are real.
[1:36:48] <frozenwaifu> lmfao
[1:36:53] <+Cymen90> @WoolieVersus Example: Build post-boxes in areas that people lose their shit a lot.
[1:37:17] <NotHereToStream> the weight shifting issue will be resolved soon, dw
[1:37:22] <%Lion_kun> Delivering yoyr own shit gives you more likes which upgrades your character.
[1:37:31] <SunPraiser> keep on keeping on :)
[1:37:33] <Djinnazz> Helping yourself is helping other ppl.
[1:37:40] <zayasu> keep on keeping on \ o /

[1:38:06] <DasFreekman> Yeah i always leave a po box near mule territory
[1:38:07] <sparkly_yoyo> Helping to help helps you, that's the essence of the STRAND
[1:38:19] <frozenwaifu> was this road made by players? if so, thats fuckin cool
[1:38:29] <+tuchpi> helping yourself ends up helping other people anyways
[1:38:35] <%Lion_kun> I built a road from Port Knot to South Knot.
[1:38:35] <+Cymen90> @WoolieVersus Did you try out Strand Parries yet?
[1:38:42] <vVAstrAVv> going there for the first time usually gets across what needs you want to fill lol

[1:42:35] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Just a tip, if for whatever reason you decide not to eat lunch, do not chew an entire pack of gum
[1:42:38] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Woolie will figure it out. Kappa

[1:43:41] <Djinnazz> @Swedish_Expert XD
[1:43:41] <%supersugoisenpai1> This is a bad time to learn
[1:43:43] <vVAstrAVv> not the time to lab the parry wool

[1:43:52] <ovan20> it's just like a fighting game Woolie rooSmug
[1:43:52] <StarlitStunner> Don’t forget the basics of CQC
[1:44:00] <derap41> Learn to parry fast
[1:44:00] <+experimental_jet> square punch
[1:44:01] <honeyman18> Hold then counter with rt
[1:44:02] <red_blaster> Press L2 with the rope, facing the enemy, then parry with R2
[1:44:03] <jack_s1n> it's a parry
[1:44:05] <+Cymen90> @WoolieVersus Info on Weapon Wheel
[1:44:06] <vVAstrAVv> just mash square
[1:44:06] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Have some faith in Woolie screwing it up.
[1:44:06] <+AbnormalVoid> wait for the R2 Prompt, Woolie
[1:44:07] <+paladinstarbuster> THERE IS A BUTTON PRESS
[1:44:10] <+linSP> the yellow bar over health is your consciousness
[1:44:10] <+experimental_jet> hold L2 and R2 to counter
[1:44:10] <+modelofrags> @WoolieVersus soooo hows it going just finished listening to you talk about vomit for 45 minutes
[1:44:13] <+heyitsdenzel_> hold l2 and r2 and push square to break guard
[1:44:13] <+theAncopro> strand only works after parry or from behind
[1:44:31] <+Prevot> always with the left and right
[1:44:51] <Graxe_> Fight time

[1:45:12] <red_blaster> Press R2 twice in a tow to tie them up
[1:45:13] <+berserker_103> I guess Woolie will be playing this game for the rest of the year
[1:45:30] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> LUL
[1:45:31] <sparkly_yoyo> @WoolieVersus you can parry and bind by pressing R2 twice
[1:45:33] <RamenRiderZ> PKers bullying chaos rune runner
[1:45:35] <honeyman18> The bars overlap each other, so yellow is like a first health bar over another
[1:45:38] <%lordsdb> THE REAL GAME STARTS NOW!
[1:45:38] <Jathspuh> hit them with cargo
[1:45:39] <NotHereToStream> use the cargo to fuck em

[1:45:56] <+theAncopro> BEEF punch
[1:45:58] <chronoxgp> instead of knives broken bottles you have cargo
[1:46:02] <vVAstrAVv> gg
[1:46:11] <+tuchpi> PogChamp
[1:46:13] <Graxe_> Mid-combat cargo sorting
[1:46:14] <NotHereToStream> also your first attack in the string has a invincibility start up, so if both attack, you win the exchange
[1:46:14] <+linSP> you can also steamroll by sprinting, holding r2 + l2 and hitting square
[1:46:16] <%This_is_Marco> saved!
[1:46:40] <Graxe_> It's like RE4 attache case sorting during a fight
[1:46:40] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:46:42] <Swedish_Expert> PogChamp not bad
[1:46:47] <+Grayhammatter> super full
[1:46:47] <%GeneralSCPatton> You can do the choke knockout after a parry
[1:46:51] <+theAncopro> you gotta mash R2 for the follow up
[1:46:55] <sparkly_yoyo> @WoolieVersus you can tie them up after parry, and you can use the cargo to hit them
[1:46:55] <ELFucilaNeroIV> Throwing the cargo is fun.
[1:46:58] <+Grayhammatter> woolie got fed PogChamp
[1:46:58] <%lordsdb> Why tie them up when you can give them a good 1-2.
[1:46:59] <cajjunb> this is kinda dumb, i love it
[1:46:59] <i_heart_gaming> its good to see him enhoying the gameplay
[1:47:01] <zayasu> @WoolieVersus after parry there is a follow up
[1:47:06] <+linSP> who fed woolie
[1:47:07] <+Cymen90> Mash R2 for instant takedown after sidestep
[1:47:08] <i_heart_gaming> *enjoying
[1:47:09] <zamzoph> they wanted to take your shit, but you took THEIR shit, instead
[1:47:11] <Haarute> no lunch for you today
[1:47:19] <+paladinstarbuster> @WoolieVersus You can parry and choke them out
[1:47:22] <i_heart_gaming> sam is plus 5
[1:47:39] <+theAncopro> yup

[1:47:53] <+DarksideBluez> late to the party here... what happened to his vehicles?
[1:47:57] <vVAstrAVv> you can also use cargo to hit people and throw it
[1:48:06] <+Cymen90> Your stand SMASHMOUTH
[1:48:07] <+tuchpi> @DarksideBluez new zone, can't make them yet
[1:48:12] <+DarksideBluez> oh
[1:48:17] <ELFucilaNeroIV> I am woolie's stand too :)
[1:48:18] <TheNewJapanGuy> !uptime
[1:48:18] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 48 minutes
[1:48:21] <i_heart_gaming> he has mastered the royal guard
[1:48:22] <Daljac> its like skyrim but youre always overenccumbered
[1:48:30] <+theAncopro> ALSO instead of putting cargo on back, you can grab the cargo mid air and smack boys with it for instant ko
[1:48:31] <+DarksideBluez> @tuchpi thabk you
[1:48:35] <startstoprepeat> you can also dodge with nothing equipped by holding l2 or r2 and jumping. it's usually easier do that if cargo's obscuring your vision.
[1:48:40] <+DarksideBluez> thank*
[1:48:51] <RamenRiderZ> Kojima should use this tech to make a 3D Oregon Trail
[1:48:51] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus another tactic is to pick up the mule cargo and swing it like a club at them
[1:49:01] <+paladinstarbuster> you also have to kick them to knock them out once youve tied them up.
[1:49:11] <sparkly_yoyo> mules run away from bt and won't bother you if you are empty-handed
[1:49:22] <+theAncopro> its DOPE
[1:49:23] <%This_is_Marco> eat ladder mules LUL
[1:49:28] <+DarksideBluez> Oregon trail 3d would be sick/ I'd buy
[1:49:31] <honeyman18> It's a one hit ko but it wrecks the cargo
[1:49:45] <chronoxgp> rd2 is pretty much oregon trail
[1:49:52] <+tuchpi> PogChamp
[1:49:58] <ovan20> rooPog
[1:50:01] <cajjunb> kick mules asses with people's lunch box
[1:50:11] <+DarksideBluez> but RD@ doesn't have enough traveling.
[1:50:12] <%GeneralSCPatton> For real?
[1:50:17] <Enyoyable> Hitting them with HIGH PERFORMANCE undewear
[1:50:20] <@SoushinSen> it doesn't sound real....

[1:51:39] <gryffinp> Junji Ito's best manga is his Cat Manga.
[1:51:41] <Jathspuh> It didn't work to cure his fear LUL
[1:51:45] <+Cymen90> Except he never got over it as he discovered new things to be scared of lol
[1:51:47] <NotHereToStream> cowards make the best horror?
[1:52:09] <%supersugoisenpai1> she was a true patriot
[1:52:19] <+Cymen90> I will NEVER have to leave this house to see the world!

[1:55:29] <+theAncopro> it removes leg cargo BUT hold way more back cargo
[1:55:34] <CuteDad69> MGSV never had POWER SKELETON

[1:55:45] <@Solidus_113> BUT THAT KG BOOST
[1:55:46] <startstoprepeat> it's passive, it only drains whhen you sprint

[1:57:07] <+berserker_103> might want to raid that mule camp eventually
[1:57:10] <@Solidus_113> Getting more stars for the Engineer will get you higher level power skeletons
[1:57:17] <NotHereToStream> ^

[1:59:58] <+JacknZack27> You can run. Thats it
[2:00:02] <+theAncopro> spring chicken
[2:00:33] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> So hey chat, what are you people doing right now?

[2:00:46] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:00:46] <+Grayhammatter> that's a huge mountain
[2:01:02] <startstoprepeat> actually the power skeleton has nothing to do with the double jump, sam can just do it for some reason
[2:01:06] <@Solidus_113> gonna use those ladders in a second
[2:01:06] <i_heart_gaming> I hate this mountain
[2:01:06] <%GeneralSCPatton> @lion_kun You can do that as long as your weight is low enough. No skeleton needed.
[2:01:07] <+paladinstarbuster> thicc reedus
[2:01:11] <Haarute> sam looking like a thicc boy
[2:01:12] <Djinnazz> Nah, your batery is fine.
[2:01:12] <%supersugoisenpai1> Batteries are not an issue unless you sprint constantly
[2:01:23] <+Cymen90> Why not BUILD or USE a postbox for all that lost cargo? @WoolieVersus
[2:01:34] <i_heart_gaming> ladder bro
[2:01:37] <darkbotle> The clapping of my powercheeks keep alerting the BT's

[2:01:51] <@Solidus_113> check that cave on the left for a memory chip
[2:01:55] <Tucker0603> Battery is only an issue if you constantly boost
[2:01:56] <%Lion_kun> Must be because I always overburden myself.
[2:02:12] <i_heart_gaming> yes
[2:02:13] <%Lion_kun> I never knew I could do it naturally.
[2:02:21] <+Cymen90> Just ENTRUST to another player

[2:04:34] <+theAncopro> you can only reclaim it before you climb/use it
[2:04:35] <sparkly_yoyo> no ladder? no problem!
[2:04:39] <startstoprepeat> #fuckaladder
[2:04:40] <NotHereToStream> use a ladder once and its unretrievable
[2:04:43] <i_heart_gaming> set up ropes on the way down to make everything easier

[2:34:24] <sparkly_yoyo> use postbox
[2:34:27] <i_heart_gaming> how many ladders and ropes does he have?
[2:34:27] <red_blaster> You can but only with Bridges trucks, Mule trucks have much lower capacity
[2:34:28] <honeyman18> Make trips, this is the farming technique
[2:34:29] <Jimbo0000> jesus
[2:34:30] <+Yagerme> Have you built all them roads.
[2:34:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> NOW THE SHIT ON YOUR BACK WON'T FIT
[2:34:34] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> use the postbox
[2:34:35] <%supersugoisenpai1> Have BB drive the other one
[2:34:38] <vVAstrAVv> all your back gear goes into the truck when you get in too. so you cant fill it completely
[2:34:40] <+puffinup> the forever LP
[2:34:51] <+Eymbee> Hey boys! How're ya now?
[2:34:52] <Jimbo0000> take a third truck back to the second truck
[2:35:02] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> you gonna make roads, if not f that shit
[2:35:03] <+Flambage> @WoolieVersus If you got a PCC you can load up the extra into a postbox
[2:35:07] <Kghaleon> If you go too far you might despawn stuff
[2:35:08] <i_heart_gaming> then introduce a fourth truck to fast travel in between the trucks
[2:35:12] <Jathspuh> Things might despawn if you get out of range. idk
[2:35:13] <+CptBritches> Just get a big ole convoy truckin through the night
[2:35:18] <+theAncopro> mission materials getting to far away
[2:35:32] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> The truck master
[2:35:35] <+JacknZack27> Put the excess in a mailbox. If you get too far away it’ll despawn otherwise
[2:35:42] <i_heart_gaming> he is essentially using the trucks as a post box
[2:36:03] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> He has to leaern the hard way
[2:36:03] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1204820081542402050?s=19
[2:36:06] <+PleasantLeech> the extra loot will just disappear in the truck
[2:36:18] <+linSP> stuff on vehicles is not protected from vanishing if you get really far away
[2:36:18] <red_blaster> Yeah, postbox is better for this
[2:36:21] <+CptBritches> Yeah being in a truck won't save it from despawning
[2:36:23] <sparkly_yoyo> There's something straight up PRIMAL about hoarding materials from a camp
[2:36:32] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> let him figure it out, better now than later in the game
[2:36:57] <i_heart_gaming> honestly he should just deposit the materials into a highway terminal. There is literally one right there by the craftsman
[2:37:13] <sparkly_yoyo> @WoolieVersus Things in trucks despawn, you should use postboxes
[2:37:23] <+linSP> ceramics are my gold standard
[2:37:34] <red_blaster> Put everything in a postbox, not a truck
[2:37:36] <+D00msDayDan> i'm looking forward to the flood of too far from cargo messages
[2:37:36] <+Cymen90> "So it looks like you got enough materials here to make a whole highway......10 bucks is the best I can do for you and that's a favor!"
[2:37:50] <+MrRabbles> just drive both trucks tomatoBrain
[2:37:51] <Jimbo0000> TWO FULL TRUCKS
[2:37:52] <Haarute> is there a third truck?
[2:38:01] <+puffinup> i
[2:38:02] <+bupkisoffthechain> Smart
[2:38:03] <red_blaster> yeyeye
[2:38:04] <+CptBritches> Just make a limo truck with both of them
[2:38:06] <Jathspuh> more greed than Pat
[2:38:14] <Jimbo0000> a v a r i c e
[2:38:19] <+puffinup> naw pat just did this offscreen lmao
[2:38:20] <Jathspuh> D:
[2:38:26] <darkbotle> drive the truck a bit, walk back to the second and drive that one and vice versa
[2:38:27] <MaeMae94> Oh thank god FeelsGoodMan
[2:38:34] <+puffinup> like literally this is how pat got the materials for all the highways
[2:38:46] <Jathspuh> i thought so lol
[2:38:51] <+CursedNobleman> ahh, nothing like watching a game about porting junk to relax from my first playthrough of RE4
[2:38:58] <i_heart_gaming> he should also build a generator to charge the truck and his legs
[2:39:00] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> chat crisis averted
[2:39:05] <@SoushinSen> Yo dawg, i herd you liek trucks so i put a truck in your truck so you can truck while you truck
[2:39:25] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Yo wtf are these buildings lol
[2:39:27] <+theAncopro> you basically can
[2:39:32] <vVAstrAVv> trucks are soon dw
[2:39:32] <+Cymen90> You can just use the Postbox I think
[2:39:36] <+puffinup> oh god
[2:39:38] <+solzan2000> you can
[2:39:39] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> put it on the ground
[2:39:39] <Jathspuh> just use the post box
[2:39:40] <+berserker_103> go straight to the postbox, you can access the truck inside it
[2:39:42] <+solzan2000> he will find out
[2:39:43] <%GeneralSCPatton> You can direct transfer from vehicle to box
[2:39:46] <sparkly_yoyo> @WoolieVersus use postbox menu
[2:39:48] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> I thought it was just "small bridge" and "ladder"
[2:39:54] <+Cymen90> @WoolieVersus Tranfer menu skips these steps
[2:40:08] <+CursedNobleman> like a little box samurai making a little box flagstaff LUL
[2:40:22] <+D00msDayDan> @WoolieVersus you can access the truck from the postbox's private locker menu
[2:40:27] <+solzan2000> LUL
[2:40:28] <+theAncopro> ypu yup
[2:40:31] <+linSP> if a vehicle is close to a terminal itll show up with its cargo in its menu
[2:40:32] <+puffinup> yeyeyeeeeee
[2:40:40] <NotHereToStream> its proximity, you should pretty be in the middle to transfer items
[2:40:42] <+Cymen90> The gound counts too! @WoolieVersus

[2:57:53] <Jathspuh> he'd have to backtrack a little
[2:57:54] <%GeneralSCPatton> Pen in a box
[2:57:59] <vVAstrAVv> timefall is in fixed places for now dw
[2:57:59] <@SoushinSen> the locker doesn't need chiral network
[2:58:02] <red_blaster> He can still use the private locker in the facility
[2:58:04] <Jathspuh> D:
[2:58:14] <+JacknZack27> You can put stuff in the locker without the network
[2:58:15] <Jathspuh> good to know @SoushinSen
[2:58:21] <+theAncopro> its fine he wont lose it
[2:58:22] <Jathspuh> i'm a dingus
[2:58:32] <Kghaleon> The crater has a shit ton of loot as well, so he won't be able to take any of it.
[2:58:38] <Djinnazz> yup
[2:58:46] <+PleasantLeech> it's probably more than one pen

[3:00:12] <+heyitsdenzel_> @WoolieVersus Mortal Kombat is testing Krossplay on PS4 and Xbox
[3:00:13] <%Aussie_Manny> So how far is Woolie into the game? 20%? 40%?

[3:00:21] <NotHereToStream> chapter 3
[3:00:24] <vVAstrAVv> cheers for reggie
[3:00:34] <%Aussie_Manny> @sparkly_yoyo Jeezus fuck.
[3:00:35] <i_heart_gaming> take some blood, piss, and cum with you too
[3:00:38] <Kghaleon> Woolie isn't out of tutorial until chapter 4.
[3:00:39] <tomdwarf> Chapter 3, so maybe about 20%?
[3:00:39] <dan_g_v> woolie is probably in the tutorial part
[3:00:43] <+theAncopro> you cant make one
[3:00:47] <sparkly_yoyo> it won't degrade
[3:00:49] <NotHereToStream> no despawn + protection out of timefall
[3:00:49] <+theAncopro> the netwrok
[3:00:50] <Djinnazz> Closer
[3:00:51] <%supersugoisenpai1> You can't build one, no network
[3:00:54] <i_heart_gaming> you can't make a locker right now because he is not on the chiral network
[3:00:57] <+D00msDayDan> postboxes are degraded by timefall
[3:00:58] <tomdwarf> Well, putting it in his means you dont need to make one.
[3:00:58] <red_blaster> Won't degrade
[3:00:59] <sparkly_yoyo> also no network
[3:01:11] <vVAstrAVv> saves a pcc lol
[3:01:13] <Djinnazz> CLOSER
[3:01:18] <red_blaster> Too far, you need to shove the truck in the door
[3:01:19] <+JacknZack27> You cant make a mailbox not on the network
[3:01:19] <Mothman742> is woolie gonna watch the game awards?
[3:01:20] <%supersugoisenpai1> Yes
[3:01:29] <+theAncopro> pcc's only work on the network
[3:01:29] <vVAstrAVv> he is
[3:01:41] <DagetStreams> Truck's gotta be facef*cking the shelter to pick up on the terminal, s' not great
[3:01:41] <+GTCknight> Need network to build
[3:01:42] <+solzan2000> everyone is watching it
[3:01:43] <tomdwarf> The network needs to be up to make any structure, including mailboxes.
[3:01:46] <Mothman742> sick thx for answering
[3:01:48] <+theAncopro> yup
[3:01:50] <i_heart_gaming> lol
[3:02:06] <+DarksideBluez> gonna need that truck for pizza
[3:02:07] <+JacknZack27> You have to be close enough
[3:02:11] <+PleasantLeech> still too far
[3:02:15] <i_heart_gaming> when your partner tell you inches don't matter point them to death stranding
[3:02:21] <red_blaster> Shelter private lockers won't degrade, so this stuff will always be avaiable to you on this shelter
[3:02:27] <%supersugoisenpai1> Place materials in locker too
[3:02:36] <i_heart_gaming> take grenades, ladders, and ropes

[3:03:40] <sparkly_yoyo> You're ready for this Woolie
[3:03:44] <gryffinp> Walk halfway across the country on foot and then hurl the crate at the shelter floor when you get there
[3:03:45] <chronoxgp> need cdl a
[3:03:46] <%Aussie_Manny> As long as we're having fun, that's what matters. woolieCHAN
[3:04:04] <i_heart_gaming> lol
[3:04:07] <+DarksideBluez> this is not the darkest timeline
[3:04:13] <+GTCknight> Just wait for a fighting game where you have to do item management mid match
[3:04:15] <@SoushinSen> a fragile dystopia, but not that fragile
[3:04:15] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:04:18] <+teamjflight> LUL
[3:04:22] <%Aussie_Manny> It's not awful and threatening, but it's not totally chill either. woolieHM
[3:04:22] <+solzan2000> oh this
[3:04:34] <+AbnormalVoid> jermaMoon
[3:04:40] <i_heart_gaming> its not the darkest timeline, its just an inconvenient timeline
[3:04:44] <tomdwarf> Yeah, containers take damage by hitting them. Ive broken stuff doing that :)
[3:04:48] <vVAstrAVv> not exciting? some tar monsters seem to disagree with that lol
[3:04:50] <%Aussie_Manny> Oh, I remember this crater.
[3:04:53] <gryffinp> I don't know man, a world where you stay in your shelter all day, a man delivers the things you can't 3d print to your doorstep for no money, and you have chiral network access to get on the chiralnet? Sounds utopic to me.
[3:05:01] <%Aussie_Manny> I snuck in. I didn't fucking truck in. LUL
[3:05:11] <+theAncopro> no truck for you
[3:05:21] <tomdwarf> Well, this'll be fun. Cant wait to see it.
[3:05:22] <+Grayhammatter> anti-truck walls
[3:05:25] <+PleasantLeech> the dead walking the earth and rain that kills you is a slow burn?
[3:05:26] <%Aussie_Manny> We've got company~!
[3:05:31] <Kghaleon> Build a bunch of ladders so you can climb over the wall with your truck
[3:05:35] <+AbnormalVoid> this place is rough, I fought my first BT boss here
[3:05:37] <Psyramics> its a timeline where a person who dies in their apartment and doesn't get discovered could nuke the whole city
[3:05:41] <@SoushinSen> lol seven.
[3:05:46] <i_heart_gaming> this place is a bit rough
[3:05:47] <@SoushinSen> eight.
[3:05:49] <+Grayhammatter> eight
[3:05:53] <i_heart_gaming> save your heamitcs as a last resort
[3:06:02] <%Aussie_Manny> @Kghaleon Does that work, like with two ladders for the wheels? PLEASE tell me that works! LUL
[3:06:06] <Kghaleon> @Psyramics That's why everyone has wrist monitors.
[3:06:11] <+theAncopro> you got this, just dont breathe ever
[3:06:13] <+DarksideBluez> rain can be avoided and so can the dead. The darkest timeline would be a place with no breathable oxygen and no drinkable water. This game has PIZZA.
[3:06:14] <tomdwarf> Honestly, I NEVER bothered with any of the EX grenades. I always just went with blood, kill them outright.
[3:06:14] <+shutup_meg> This is where I stopped when I last played. This place is rough.
[3:06:23] <+bupkisoffthechain> @Psyramics no death doesnt cause an explosion, a live human has to be eaten by a BT to cause the voidout
[3:06:29] <+ConLin_Arts_> there is a good data collectible here
[3:06:33] <+PleasantLeech> @aussie_manny a truck will destroy ladders
[3:06:38] <i_heart_gaming> just ladder over
[3:06:44] <%Aussie_Manny> You can't pee now! Don't take your dick out NOW! D:
[3:06:49] <+Cymen90> ?????????
[3:06:51] <+heyitsdenzel_> darkness imprisoning me
[3:06:58] <+ConLin_Arts_> yeee
[3:07:04] <+ConLin_Arts_> that one is good!
[3:07:12] <Psyramics> @bupkisoffthechain A BT in a population center is a guaranteed voidout. Every city on the eastern seaboard is a crater
[3:07:13] <%Aussie_Manny> sneeki fucc
[3:07:17] <Kghaleon> Hope you brought lots of grenades
[3:07:17] <%supersugoisenpai1> Grenade time

[3:07:29] <+ConLin_Arts_> I only ever really used Bloodnades

[3:08:02] <+shutup_meg> uh oh
[3:08:05] <+D00msDayDan> i see woolie forgot how to throw grenades
[3:08:08] <%supersugoisenpai1> It makes them move away
[3:08:08] <marvel877> Just got in, where is he at now?
[3:08:09] <+PleasantLeech> if you hold your breath you can walk right next to them
[3:08:12] <%GeneralSCPatton> Literal waste of time. Non-blood is pointless
[3:08:20] <+theAncopro> oooooooh boy
[3:08:30] <tomdwarf> @GeneralSCPatton Eh, they
[3:08:33] <+Cymen90> just scan
[3:08:37] <Solidnick18> BT's ain't shit
[3:08:47] <tomdwarf> may find that out on their own. I stopped at about chapter 5 with anything other than blood.
[3:08:48] <%Aussie_Manny> @marvel877 The crater where Fragile blew up a small city.
[3:08:52] <+ConLin_Arts_> think this is gonna win the VGA?
[3:08:53] <Jathspuh> who needs a ladder 4Head
[3:09:00] <i_heart_gaming> ghost: " bro, is this fucking piss, are you literally throwing fucking piss at me? NOT COOL"

[3:11:05] <NotHereToStream> pissing your pants would probably save your life at that point
[3:11:08] <+puffinup> OH SHIT

[3:11:53] <+Cymen90> Just get used to eliminating threats
[3:12:09] <NotHereToStream> @PleasantLeech oh yeah, good point
[3:12:11] <+D00msDayDan> that one's lighter because it has 3 grenades left
[3:12:33] <%supersugoisenpai1> Anything equipped goes to tool rack
[3:12:41] <tomdwarf> Degredation doesnt reduce the weight of an item. Its lighter because each "Hermatic Grenade" is a pack. Each pack has 5 grenades, so the lighter one has less grenades.
[3:12:59] <Solidnick18> now get out
[3:13:13] <sparkly_yoyo> GREEED
[3:13:15] <vVAstrAVv> good luck carrying THAT

[3:14:14] <+CptBritches> Ceramics are worth taking
[3:14:18] <sparkly_yoyo> the smell of the game
[3:14:24] <tomdwarf> I also stopped bringing container repair spray later in the game, as I never tripped or fell on my missions.
[3:14:30] <+Grayhammatter> LUL

[3:15:13] <+CptBritches> Lmao
[3:15:19] <chronoxgp> woolie eyes
[3:15:23] <%supersugoisenpai1> You get gear later that lets you take EVERYTHING
[3:15:24] <+teamjflight> take it all tbh
[3:15:25] <tomdwarf> I know, but Timefall only damages a container, not the actual health of anything. If you dont trip or fall, you get perfect score for the delivery.
[3:15:27] <Solidnick18> lol
[3:15:36] <+CptBritches> Maybe hold one of them in your hands
[3:15:42] <+Cymen90> @WoolieVersus Consider shortscuts
[3:15:49] <tomdwarf> Contrainer repair spray also doesnt repair tools such as grenades, ladders, etc. So yeah, I stopped using them.
[3:15:50] <+theAncopro> you can do it
[3:15:53] <i_heart_gaming> you can put up ladders and ropes in this area if needed
[3:16:01] <Solidnick18> just avoid all dem bt's
[3:16:20] <+Cymen90> @Solidnick18 Nah. Kill and take materials
[3:16:28] <%supersugoisenpai1> Throw it, they'll be destroyed soon anyway
[3:16:39] <Kghaleon> @tomdwarf Pretty sure timefall damages both, and there's no way to avoid timefall except with vehicles or timefall shelters.
[3:16:51] <Solidnick18> @Cymen90 i would just get caught and fight them so they all go away
[3:17:02] <sparkly_yoyo> You must have literal tons of cargo
[3:17:04] <+theAncopro> i love this heel turn into greed

[3:18:35] <smugjorgen98> I look away for one second and this happens
[3:18:38] <tomdwarf> @Kghaleon. When I played, it ONLY damaged container health, not material health. Unless it was patched, you dont explicitly need it. container spray is if your worried about mistakes.
[3:18:39] <Djinnazz> time for a generator
[3:18:43] <+theAncopro> youll be on the netwrok soon, build a generator then
[3:18:44] <RobotInProgress> who needs knees

[3:21:58] <+theAncopro> YES
[3:22:00] <%supersugoisenpai1> Bola rules
[3:22:03] <+AbnormalVoid> bola gun is the shit
[3:22:06] <i_heart_gaming> Canada: Land of the living, and the still living
[3:22:08] <Solidnick18> that's a good thing to have
[3:22:08] <ShmowzowKapow> GUN
[3:22:09] <+Grayhammatter> oh no
[3:22:22] <Dementedpenguin> The best weapon in the game, in my opinion.
[3:22:24] <vVAstrAVv> mules are now completely trivial
[3:22:33] <+tuchpi> wtf cmonBruh
[3:22:34] <i_heart_gaming> this is the best weapon in the game
[3:22:41] <gryffinp> ALL PORTERS ARE BASTARDS
[3:22:42] <+CptBritches> Yeah the bola gun is ridiculous
[3:22:44] <+Cymen90> WTF cmonBruh
[3:22:46] <Graxe_> SOP?
[3:22:49] <+AbnormalVoid> do you even run into regular porters who are terrorists?
[3:22:49] <i_heart_gaming> ebola gun too good
[3:22:53] <+GTCknight> No currency in the apocalypse is the best thing about a apocalypse
[3:22:58] <+theAncopro> why did he look at himself he can't see the hologram
[3:23:05] <%redrins> ebola gun GET
[3:23:14] <tomdwarf> Yeah, bolas weapons are great. I stuck with Non-lethal assault rifles, just because you can headshot knock out targets, without having to run up and kick the target.
[3:23:17] <+D00msDayDan> incoming ebola jokes
[3:23:20] <+DarksideBluez> currency is a Cain concept. dude killed his bro
[3:23:26] <Graxe_> Sons of the Patriots?
[3:23:34] <itesket> A bola deez nuts
[3:23:37] <NotHereToStream> only lvl 2 bola
[3:23:37] <+Grayhammatter> what!
[3:23:37] <%supersugoisenpai1> You could kill someone with a bola gun I'm sure
[3:23:39] <+Proxzo> Headshots with Bola Gun is like head shots with Tranq dart @WoolieVersus
[3:23:40] <Dementedpenguin> The BEST gun.
[3:23:50] <chronoxgp> embibe with YOUR BLOOD
[3:23:54] <zil_nine> I know it's off topic but opinion on Leroy Smith? @WoolieVersus
[3:24:08] <+Prevot> PogChamp
[3:24:08] <+linSP> bola gun doesnt knock out mules if you hit them below the neck, gotta kick em
[3:24:10] <%GeneralSCPatton> Headshot is knockout. Bodyshot ties them up, but they can be kicked for knockout.
[3:24:26] <i_heart_gaming> make sure you knowck out people that get hit by ebola or else they will get back up
[3:24:28] <+Grayhammatter> god, that's so tiny
[3:24:29] <tomdwarf> Ah, thanks. I legit didnt realize that.
[3:24:36] <+theAncopro> so make sure you get a clear shot
[3:24:45] <+Flambage> @WoolieVersus Ammo for it refills in safehouse
[3:24:50] <NotHereToStream> lvl 2, just level this guy up
[3:24:54] <+theAncopro> na its just automatic
[3:25:01] <Solidnick18> lvl 2 bola gun is great
[3:25:04] <tomdwarf> No, the blood ammo is automatic. No need to make the ammo
[3:25:10] <+theAncopro> do it
[3:25:13] <+D00msDayDan> @WoolieVersus bola gun has blood ammo built in
[3:25:22] <%supersugoisenpai1> Go raid a MULE camp
[3:25:24] <+Proxzo> You can do head shots with it
[3:25:24] <i_heart_gaming> use it on mules
[3:25:24] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:25:34] <vVAstrAVv> time to bulli the muleys
[3:25:41] <+Proxzo> it's a fun aiming style too
[3:25:42] <Solidnick18> Find a mule and test it
[3:26:13] <i_heart_gaming> he should spend the next 30 minutes building rodes with the materials he got
[3:26:15] <%GeneralSCPatton> If you don't headshot, then you have to kick them afterwards
[3:26:26] <%supersugoisenpai1> It aims like the plasma cutter in Dead Space
[3:26:27] <worldbrand> you getp lenty of rounds
[3:26:32] <NotHereToStream> well thankfully you don't have to wait too long to test it out
[3:26:34] <chronoxgp> hang on rool rack

[3:27:59] <+Grayhammatter> he needs a better skeleton though
[3:28:12] <Solidnick18> you gotta upgrade the station
[3:28:12] <%GeneralSCPatton> USE HOT SPRING
[3:28:15] <Kghaleon> Get the level 3 skeleton...it's like 310kg
[3:28:15] <NotHereToStream> hot spring close to replenish your shit
[3:28:16] <%supersugoisenpai1> Deliver to the Engineer for better skeleton
[3:28:20] <i_heart_gaming> to upgrade the skeleton just do a couple of deliveries for the engineer, the manga guy
[3:28:28] <+tuchpi> do more shit for Engineer
[3:28:37] <+linSP> get junji up to four stars at least
[3:28:41] <NotHereToStream> you get better equipment if you deliver more to the preppers that initially provided you with the level 1 item
[3:28:41] <vVAstrAVv> get upgrades by leveling up whoever gave you the item
[3:28:46] <gamewarden92> hot spring?
[3:28:47] <+JacknZack27> You have to do extra deliveries to get upgrades
[3:28:49] <+PleasantLeech> get more stars with Junji ito
[3:28:56] <i_heart_gaming> the same thing with ebola gun, do more stuff for this guy
[3:29:04] <worldbrand> nah it's further east

[3:37:41] <%neraren> Give them your precious urine, get thumbs up
[3:37:52] <+Flambage> But the grenades drain blood as you use it so they would be useless to them
[3:37:55] <%QaizerArt> Woolie'll find out later, but you get a cheevo for doing that.
[3:38:00] <i_heart_gaming> Evderyone: thats cute Reggie: they can frame you for blood you know
[3:38:01] <Solidnick18> nope
[3:38:02] <Chaoko99> can you pee on people or is that not possible
[3:38:13] <Chaoko99> I know you can't do it to unconscious people

[3:39:40] <sparkly_yoyo> I'd say it's time to store the truck
[3:39:48] <+tuchpi> or store it
[3:39:49] <@Solidus_113> go to Mule Camp and steal back their stuff
[3:39:52] <i_heart_gaming> you have to go the mule camp, take the system server and deliver it back
[3:39:58] <sparkly_yoyo> ?
[3:39:59] <+DarksideBluez> if you throw sperm grenade in enemy's face is that considered a MONEY SHOT?
[3:40:01] <sparkly_yoyo> wait you can't?
[3:40:06] <i_heart_gaming> backup truck is there remember
[3:40:10] <sparkly_yoyo> Oh well
[3:40:12] <Solidnick18> i don't think you can store trucks
[3:40:20] <+tuchpi> you can only store bridges trucks
[3:40:25] <Chaoko99> So as we know, JUMP FORCE is on the nominations for best fighting game.
[3:40:39] <Chaoko99> Is this because of the few fighting games that came out this year or is it actually secretly good
[3:40:44] <NotHereToStream> few
[3:40:47] <sparkly_yoyo> Jump Force doesn't even have Arale, what a scam
[3:40:48] <+DarksideBluez> veyr few
[3:40:50] <+tuchpi> meme nominations
[3:41:00] <NotHereToStream> next year is gonna be good since GBVS and GG Strive
[3:41:03] <+theAncopro> the kill la kill one would be better than jumpforce
[3:41:25] <i_heart_gaming> doesnt kill la kill only have like 10 playable characters?
[3:41:40] <sparkly_yoyo> the game awards lack thuggery

[3:51:55] <Tucker0603> @commandersqueaks could be cuffs, they look like cogs to me though
[3:51:59] <D3rrtyD4n> they wont wake up for a long time
[3:52:01] <masterfire23> you can't kill mules by running them over right?
[3:52:01] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Take the new truck
[3:52:02] <Solidnick18> eh it's fine
[3:52:03] <+ShanaEchidna> put it on the truck
[3:52:04] <+theAncopro> yea
[3:52:07] <%supersugoisenpai1> Height limit
[3:52:10] <@Solidus_113> Each Mule Camp has a memory chip inside one of the tents
[3:52:10] <sparkly_yoyo> Sam Porter Bridges has never killed anyone
[3:52:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> There's a limit of how much actual stuff you can have on you.
[3:52:18] <+ShanaEchidna> use the truck @woolieversus
[3:52:18] <+theAncopro> that will be VERY interesting later
[3:52:21] <Chaoko99> It's a shame there's a height limit
[3:52:24] <Chaoko99> Because imagine like
[3:52:26] <+Bob_Tom> leaning tower of reedus
[3:52:32] <Chaoko99> a big wobbly Astral Chain tower of boxes
[3:52:36] <+Proxzo> can you get a new truck?
[3:52:37] <i_heart_gaming> there is a volume and weight limit
[3:52:41] <+ShanaEchidna> you can load stuff in the back of the truck
[3:52:41] <Chaoko99> did anyone actually manage to get the fuckin' icecream thing done
[3:52:42] <i_heart_gaming> you just hit the volume limit
[3:52:47] <D3rrtyD4n> its working
[3:53:14] <i_heart_gaming> take the new truck, dont take your old shitty truck
[3:53:19] <RyuuAoi> Keep on truckin', baby! Gotta keep on truckin'!

[3:54:01] <+Cymen90> @WoolieVersus What is your FIGHTSTICK's name?
[3:54:04] <RyuuAoi> A truck is still a truck...even if there's no one sitting there.
[3:54:04] <sparkly_yoyo> NAMES ARE FOR COWARDS
[3:54:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> The fact that someone can be an adult anywhere and have never owned a car is so weird to me.
[3:54:10] <i_heart_gaming> dont give woolie children, he will not name them
[3:54:12] <GarbageNirvana> My car's name is "piece of shit" so
[3:54:24] <Kghaleon> I hate naming pokemon, turned that shit off
[3:54:31] <Chaoko99> Anyone else excited for SamSho to get that award as it is the only thing deserving of it
[3:54:33] <RyuuAoi> It's not, Woolie! I love Miley White! My CAR. Not my dick.
[3:54:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> @kghaleon You are literally a monster.
[3:54:36] <+Namillus> @CommanderSqueaks I don't trust myself behind the wheel and I live in an area with decently-serving public transport
[3:54:36] <+D00msDayDan> that sound isn't for objective cargo, just anything you've dropped

[3:55:06] <+Prevot> Reggie only names FEET
[3:55:07] <Rixstarian> @woolieversus How about naming the vomit in your shirt?
[3:55:13] <DatAsuna> reggie names toes
[3:55:17] <+Cymen90> N E W TRUCK
[3:55:23] <@Moobot> That's a tad too many emotes, @Yagerme (warning)
[3:55:26] <Chaoko99> I don't name things but I like to refer to inanimate objects as friends. It's really weird because people catch me talking to the computers while I fix them at work.
[3:55:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> @namillus My work is 20 miles away, either I drive for half an hour or take an hour to an hour and a half with public transit.
[3:55:36] <i_heart_gaming> oh look, its good ol not rusty truck, superior to good ol rusty
[3:55:49] <sparkly_yoyo> Greed
[3:55:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> That truck looks like a Frank to me.
[3:55:50] <+Bob_Tom> if you're close enough you can scan them with the odradecck
[3:55:53] <+Yagerme> doogNo doogNo doogNo
[3:55:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> I'm gonna call Woolie's truck Frank from now on.
[3:56:01] <Chaoko99> Man, that truck is so much nicer than my current car
[3:56:17] <sparkly_yoyo> You can use that shit to build roads, yo!
[3:56:19] <@Solidus_113> Put all these ceramics into the roads
[3:56:24] <+solzan2000> ^
[3:56:28] <renegadorade> Those trucks dont't hold as much as bridges Trucks
[3:56:30] <Kghaleon> By end game I realized I had collected tons of loot and never used any of it. Elixirs man.
[3:56:30] <NotHereToStream> metals and ceremics and chiral crystals
[3:56:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> Ceramics and Metals = Roads.
[3:56:41] <sparkly_yoyo> Also chiral crystals
[3:56:45] <i_heart_gaming> PRO TIPS: if you drive 1 truck up to another truck, you can transfer stuff in between truck A and truck B
[3:56:58] <sparkly_yoyo> Roads need a little chiral for the evil effect
[3:57:18] <+Yagerme> I been warned for to many emotes. I never heard of such a thing.
[3:57:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> Thank you everyone to Woolie learns logistics.
[3:57:36] <+imabooterfly> we TRUCKIN now

[3:58:49] <RyuuAoi> Fuck trucks
[3:58:50] <vVAstrAVv> woolie just drive the NEW truck closer lol
[3:58:59] <sparkly_yoyo> DS has made a lot of QOL stuff that everyone should copy
[3:59:05] <Chaoko99> Anyone else wish there was another superhot
[3:59:08] <+Yagerme> Hit it from behind
[3:59:14] <+Grayhammatter> nice
[3:59:18] <Chaoko99> It's sure a shame that superhot has pretty much just become a powerup in other games
[3:59:21] <RyuuAoi> Quality of life
[3:59:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> At least ONE person will get into logistical engineering because of this game.
[3:59:26] <NotHereToStream> alright lets get this out on to a tra
[3:59:27] <sparkly_yoyo> you can drive it off a ramp
[3:59:28] <$laphyrion> How much inventory can YOU sort within the stopped time?
[3:59:30] <omid97> deathstranding very good sund trak
[3:59:33] <i_heart_gaming> leave the old shitty truck there for the mules to use later.

[4:00:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> Subtlety is for cowards = Kojima
[4:00:42] <sparkly_yoyo> guy*
[4:00:58] <NotHereToStream> i believe the yellow lines are the built high way
[4:01:01] <+Bob_Tom> you got the server
[4:01:03] <sparkly_yoyo> To be fair, that's how name works: Smith, Miller, Farmer, etc
[4:01:15] <+Proxzo> Your System Server item is on your truck, so you good
[4:01:31] <+Yagerme> It took me two days to build every part of them dang roads. But it made my life easier.
[4:01:37] <vVAstrAVv> stop looking at the map and truck already
[4:01:42] <omid97> how is Emily
[4:01:42] <+heyitsdenzel_> roll out
[4:01:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> @yagerme I literally spent a whole day just building every single road on this map.
[4:01:52] <+D00msDayDan> is his plan to jump off the end of the road?
[4:01:53] <D3rrtyD4n> atpCap
[4:02:11] <%CommanderSqueaks> @yagerme I also built out a zipline circuit to every single drop-off point
[4:02:13] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[4:02:26] <+Cymen90> IF ONLY there was a way to complete the bridge
[4:02:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Cymen90 No, it's impossible.
[4:02:38] <D3rrtyD4n> you can cross that small stream
[4:02:51] <+theAncopro> no no thats a good road
[4:03:03] <NotHereToStream> that road is safe
[4:03:07] <DedlokPM> yeah a LOT of last names are from when they decided that the right to a last name was not just a thing for nobles. So a lot of them were just adapted versions of their job titles
[4:03:25] <D3rrtyD4n> oh boy
[4:03:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> Get on that road dammit.
[4:03:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> AAAAGH
[4:03:34] <+linSP> cursed roads
[4:03:38] <DedlokPM> So if your last name is Cooper, at some point someone in your family line was a barrel maker
[4:03:42] <D3rrtyD4n> you can use that highway
[4:03:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie don't be like this, okay phew.
[4:03:51] <mdkcde> Trukkin'
[4:03:52] <+Grayhammatter> that road is complete
[4:04:02] <+Proxzo> BUS
[4:04:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie the Canadian confused by roads.
[4:04:09] <sparkly_yoyo> In Spanish there's the name Verdugo, which means Executioner. Heavy family history I guess.
[4:04:11] <D3rrtyD4n> its complete
[4:04:12] <+Bob_Tom> bridges and trucks are kinda janky
[4:04:13] <i_heart_gaming> now boost!
[4:04:14] <D3rrtyD4n> yup
[4:04:17] <+theAncopro> yea
[4:04:20] <@Solidus_113> chiral asphalt
[4:04:21] <+Bob_Tom> yep
[4:04:21] <+future_ry> yeah roads are evil as fuck
[4:04:23] <sparkly_yoyo> yeah its the chirals
[4:04:27] <+Cymen90> BOOST
[4:04:27] <taptapmuhgap> If you have the last name smith there is a large chance you had a military person in yo family line who didn't have a last name
[4:04:28] <NotHereToStream> looks cool to me
[4:04:30] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> Chiral roads bro
[4:04:31] <DedlokPM> Yes they all have that floating particle stuff
[4:04:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> @woolieversus These are LITERALLY 3D Printer ROads.
[4:04:36] <Chaoko99> The roads are like that because Chiralium has antigravity things.
[4:04:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> **Printed
[4:04:39] <+JacknZack27> You can click in the stick to go faster
[4:04:41] <vVAstrAVv> just the overpasses
[4:04:45] <@Solidus_113> now build this first stretch of road
[4:04:45] <DedlokPM> It's a side effect from being made with Chiral shit
[4:04:46] <mdkcde> trukkin'
[4:04:47] <+Yagerme> I wasn’t walking with mama. I drove her ass and she still (no spoilers) lol.
[4:04:53] <+theAncopro> yea boost only on road
[4:04:55] <+linSP> you can L3 gun it on roads for free
[4:04:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Yagerme I used that Zipline network I was talking about.
[4:05:02] <+Bob_Tom> also, only the light grey center strip is the energy zone
[4:05:05] <i_heart_gaming> boosting is good on roads because it doesn't use batteries
[4:05:05] <RyuuAoi> Get yo kicks on route 23!
[4:05:06] <D3rrtyD4n> row adds
[4:05:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> The whole trip took me 7 minutes.

[4:05:52] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> Why'd he get out?
[4:05:53] <i_heart_gaming> the convoy song was too powerful for mortal gears
[4:06:02] <+theAncopro> can;t store mule trucks
[4:06:02] <mrfreezepunsbestpuns> cause he's a good christian boy
[4:06:03] <RyuuAoi> Woolie is high......
[4:06:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> I actually used to listen to that song on old casette tapes with my grandpa, it tripped me out when Futurama played it.
[4:06:05] <@Solidus_113> Just means you can't store Mule Trucks
[4:06:09] <+solzan2000> ^
[4:06:13] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> ^^

[4:12:40] <%supersugoisenpai1> Jumping does tire her out a bit
[4:12:42] <+Grayhammatter> are we gonna be on ride with norman reedus?
[4:12:46] <Kghaleon> but cutscenes tho
[4:12:47] <vVAstrAVv> i found like 2 memory chips total lpl
[4:12:48] <langdonalgar> It literally takes effort
[4:12:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> @WoolieVersus Also, just so you haven't figured it out, you can totally pee on the BT's and it has the same effect of a piss grenade.
[4:13:15] <+Jasek7> caht what chapter we at?
[4:13:26] <vVAstrAVv> pat told him dw
[4:13:26] <+Cymen90> @WoolieVersus And the crater
[4:13:29] <@Solidus_113> Take those Metals and Ceramics and build the first road with it
[4:13:32] <+tuchpi> NotLikeThis
[4:13:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie has no discovered what the true anxiety of this game is.
[4:13:35] <sparkly_yoyo> yeah but you have roads
[4:13:35] <+theAncopro> itll stay there whenever you're good to get it
[4:13:35] <$Louie_Salmon> Lotta TRUCKIN' to do.
[4:13:38] <+JingKaisean> is the pee actually effective? I've never killed a BT with the piss or shit grenades
[4:13:38] <%supersugoisenpai1> You can grab it on the way to the next distro center
[4:13:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> **Has now discovered
[4:13:42] <+Grayhammatter> the crater had so much stuff too
[4:13:43] <worldbrand> the mules wont have respawned that quickly, i dont think
[4:13:44] <+Prevot> NotLikeThis
[4:13:52] <D3rrtyD4n> they dont respawn that fast
[4:13:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> @JingKaisean you can't kill them with it, but it disorients and dissuades them.
[4:13:58] <+theAncopro> crater is easy now that you got the chiral going on though
[4:13:59] <vVAstrAVv> woolie thats too much greed pump the breaks lol
[4:14:03] <Dementedpenguin> @Jasek7 3
[4:14:13] <NotHereToStream> don't forget to deliver to upgrade your equipment
[4:14:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> @jingkaisean Only blood-based weapons can actually kill them.
[4:14:17] <$Louie_Salmon> Also the mules stay defeated for a good while, so it shouldn't be too bad.
[4:14:21] <i_heart_gaming> building roads makes greed easier
[4:14:21] <+Jasek7> @Dementedpenguin oooooof

[4:28:40] <MichaelDood> Or Andores lies.
[4:28:41] <worldbrand> yknow im kinda surprised they never added any items as dlc
[4:29:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> No! Frisk and their final smash is they're taken over by Chara and just do a single stab.

[4:30:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> "Astral Chain says Slavery is GREAT" - Woolie Madden probably.
[4:30:28] <vicious_rage> If XQC still lived in Canada I'd push him for the podcast.
[4:30:32] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> Yo word @DXLelouch24
[4:30:42] <worldbrand> but at the same time im glad it mostly stuck to doin its action rpg stuff
[4:30:43] <+saladin1911> I still have not played Automata. I should probably do that soon
[4:30:48] <+JingKaisean> woolie, are you gonna eat on stream?
[4:30:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> I can understand why, Automata is a beast.
[4:30:55] <$laphyrion> If you think about it, Legions are just really big armored Bridge Babies.
[4:30:56] <smugjorgen98> @gunsrlove no astral chain is the first austrailia related game
[4:30:59] <%supersugoisenpai1> supersugoisenpai1 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! The text in DS is kind of small, but nothing can be as bad as playing Dead Rising before I owned an HD TV. The text was so small and blurry, it actually could not be read.
[4:31:01] <%supersugoisenpai1> supersugoisenpai1's Sub shared rewards to 5 others in Chat! 
[4:31:02] <Astaroth130> automata is amazing

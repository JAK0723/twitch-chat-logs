[0:20:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> offline local costs money though along with playing with friends.
[0:20:35] <%Josef_Stryker> Fighting games definitely should be cross-play as the standard
[0:20:38] <LoneFonte> also, GGPO
[0:20:47] <%LVDoomien> hey guys look its the coolest character in Fantasy Strike
[0:21:40] <floralkami> the madlads included a guitar setup

[0:22:30] <%Josef_Stryker> Dragon Pat
[0:22:33] <%CaptainPileDriver> that game is loud
[0:22:37] <%SomersaultJustice> his voice is really low
[0:22:38] <floralkami> manager-san is low
[0:22:39] <JohnnyContra> The game is still too loud
[0:22:40] <%CaptainPileDriver> nooo
[0:22:42] <+CharredChord> Turn up the call volume pls
[0:22:42] <%Solidnick18> pretty loud
[0:22:43] <%jiggy_snipe> his audio is low or game audio is too loud
[0:22:44] <+TheBesteban> The second I can travel to Montreal, I'm redoing your whole ghetto audio setup
[0:22:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> lower
[0:22:48] <+kewlmyc> Either turn him up or turn the game down

[0:23:14] <+Superbro64> blow out my ears more please Kreygasm
[0:23:29] <SymphonicMetalCitadel> Seems like guest volume and game volume went down and up together?
[0:23:32] <%SomersaultJustice> TALL PAT
[0:23:35] <BaslerJones> Hey its pat
[0:23:40] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[0:23:42] <%SuperKirby24> LUL
[0:23:54] <+gaemjurnalist> music kinda sounds like bloody tears
[0:23:57] <%LVDoomien> yah Midori is like Grandmaster Pat
[0:24:03] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[0:24:12] <%PKSomething> Jump is a button?
[0:24:18] <+Triforce505> a to jump??
[0:24:22] <+Spinningrobo> jump button PogChamp
[0:24:51] <%BinaryFireball> Oh wait is this Sirlin?
[0:24:58] <KaironFortressKnight> yeah that's Ryu alright
[0:25:31] <+Spinningrobo> it's a weird thing though since sirlin has always been an advocate of using less complex inputs for moves where possible
[0:25:35] <NotHereToStream> geiger is guile pretty much
[0:25:38] <%Proxzo> Question: If I download on Switch, how's this game on WiFi?
[0:25:52] <JPU6400> its got rollback so itll be less booty than usual
[0:25:56] <+Spinningrobo> I remember him writing about how much he hated two button throws
[0:26:01] <MutedMimic> LUL
[0:26:05] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[0:26:08] <+dmtjinni> sick.....
[0:26:09] <%SuperKirby24> LUL
[0:26:10] <%Proxzo> Any switch players?
[0:26:11] <%Josef_Stryker> Something something Za Warudo
[0:26:17] <%LastHazzerd> game still overpowering guest voice when moves are happening, for me at least
[0:26:23] <JPU6400> @Proxzo its crossplay
[0:26:31] <illTemperedSeaBass> I'm disappointed that Geiger doesn't have a German accent.
[0:26:38] <%FuqBoiSlim> @proxzo I'm downloading it right now so I'll let you know
[0:26:41] <%jiggy_snipe> yea the game overall is too loud to hear guest
[0:26:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> man, 20 bucks to play with friends online and to play local
[0:26:45] <%Proxzo> I should just try it out
[0:26:52] <%Proxzo> it's free to try
[0:26:55] <+SundanceShot> hit sparks communicating advantage/disadvantage is pretty cool
[0:27:04] <GPAlpha> Yeah, move sounds are a little loud
[0:27:19] <%FuqBoiSlim> for reference the switch port of Skullgirls didn't give me much problems on wireless and thats rollback too
[0:27:28] <JPU6400> why isnt the game taking up the full viewport?
[0:27:28] <%PKSomething> that's cool
[0:27:45] <%PKSomething> the audio in this game is really crunchy
[0:28:05] <+Mendin> Does Geiger still have the Air-Pause to let him jump forward and regain charge?
[0:28:16] <floralkami> yes
[0:28:50] <+Psycosis> does reggie like Valerie because FEET?
[0:28:50] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts

[1:50:54] <ExileNineteen> @ShadowpulseKDH1 you're definitely correct, but the unique bonus when you end the game will currently do very little to aid woolie or minh. that means if the game ends now reggie wins

[2:12:24] <+MagicBeanBurrito> Minh wants Woolie's N pass
[2:12:31] <Xeno351> it would be a smarter move to get rid of the passport for both minh and reggie
[2:12:31] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> Minh is desperate. Don’t listen to his LIES

[2:19:51] <legacyofsol> @woolieversus Remember the immortal words from The Forbidden Kingdom: "He who speak does not know, he who knows does not speak; clearly, you are an expert at Kung Fu." .. I don't think the drunken master would be saying this about Minh during Reggie's decision making.
[2:19:55] <+Gespens> I actually don't think Purse Cutter can affect the Passport

[2:21:42] <%b_aleph> pocketsand sshheeeshaahhh
[2:21:46] <%Ipsenscastle> @StaceMcGate remember when Woolie was in first? He was way way worse
[2:21:50] <%C4m3r0n0409> @Xeno351 Thats how Woolie plays
[2:21:51] <%Ashenik1> Isnt this the end game though?
[2:21:51] <%0rond> reggie is our red oni, he needs to be overconfident and boistreous, and give others a fair chance.
[2:21:52] <+HelloImTom08> sofieHmm
[2:21:53] <Parapattern> You could play this game blindfolded and win
[2:21:59] <masterpoloko> Reggie is nutz

[2:22:03] <+Aztec50> but wouldnt you want to end knowing you at least start with the lead if anything weird happens?
[2:22:05] <昼寝の神様> chat the game literally fucked mihn over so hard last time LUL
[2:22:07] <%Superdandy96> Knowing Reggie’s luck though, he might bumble kill the darkling.
[2:22:08] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> @ashenik1 “Endgame”
[2:22:09] <%hamahiroyuki> what if y'all stall the game until mihn buy a passport? 4Head
[2:22:18] <Darren716> Go for the blisters!
[2:22:19] <%StaceMcGate> @Ipsenscastle I agree, but this whole LP is Woolie's humility arc. He **needs** to lose to unlock the 8th gate
[2:22:20] <%C4m3r0n0409> Woolie is just hoping the game lets him win
[2:22:30] <%nintega010> @Ipsenscastle nah woolie was the best hero. only short lived though

[2:22:45] <neraren> He needs to start getting to a zone before he cuts the passport so he can escape
[2:22:52] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie defnintely going back in
[2:22:57] <neraren> Cutting the passport just makes you a target for the other 2
[2:22:57] <%Superdandy96> @kingkeldeo31 we in filler Training Arc bois
[2:23:07] <%Andrizzleton> woolie is speaking the "anything can happen" into existence for when he wins the pop off will be prophetic

[3:07:06] <$TIME_PUNCHER> 3hrs 6mins
[3:07:08] <%jiggy_snipe> can't fight on item spaces
[3:07:08] <%kingkeldeo31> Alchemy is purely for money
[3:07:09] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Superdandy96 With his no weapons LUL
[3:07:16] <+IwuzPh34rless> He has no weapons/shields. It'd be stupid to fight Minh
[3:07:16] <Camail> woolie is in heck, its not filler
[3:07:17] <+PhantomMiG> So what is the end condition
[3:07:20] <%krispen_wa> What would you liiiiike~

[3:07:40] <%Superdandy96> @th3smartalec what do you mean? He’s got his fist still Kappa
[3:07:41] <$TIME_PUNCHER> Woolie is the Vegita of Naruto
[3:07:42] <%Sulliman34> minh could die from a single punch
[3:07:45] <+IwuzPh34rless> Cut that fool again!
[3:07:49] <smackdownbeef> overconfidence, minh
[3:07:57] <%StaceMcGate> Woolie is Doom Slayer, fighting against Demons with 0 chance of survival
[3:07:59] <%Sulliman34> overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer
[3:08:00] <%StaceMcGate> but somehow making it
[3:08:02] <%Grayhammatter> reggie, look at the weapon store
[3:08:07] <Camail> weapon shop is open, at least
[3:08:08] <ExileNineteen> nitro doesn't kill, it reduces to 1
[3:08:12] <%Amaideus> Friendly reminder I made a poll asking who you guys think will be the victor and left it in the subreddit, so get to voting if you haven't!
[3:08:19] <%Superdandy96> @time_puncher with how things are going for Woolz, I’d say he’s more like the Tien. Kappa

[4:13:43] <+Dimfish> who knows
[4:13:45] <Shishi1205> Give it a few tests more
[4:13:47] <%iswearimjustdandy> What happened
[4:13:49] <%Sulliman34> the cost of gettign back into heck is too high. dont die now
[4:13:50] <%Jetzord> anything important happen in the last hour?
[4:13:52] <smackdownbeef> But what if tho?
[4:13:53] <%Amaideus> ROB HER
[4:13:54] <Shishi1205> You can always darkling
[4:13:57] <+pectusumbra> woolie just needs some health to get back in the game
[4:13:57] <%tearknack> @Jetzord nope
[4:13:58] <+kknutson4> Die and go Darkling. Take towns and get levels
[4:13:58] <%Grayhammatter> need to purse cut that stuff
[4:13:59] <%C4m3r0n0409> Woolie if you die games over
[4:14:00] <%Th3SmartAlec> @nintega010 In his defense, the Come Here happened after he entered and screwed it all up
[4:14:01] <%yeetdabsenpai69> I'm salty minh isnt even trying to beat the endgame
[4:14:01] <ExileNineteen> woolie in the bad place because his instinct to grind it out and push forward which will lose him the game
[4:14:03] <%krispen_wa> @ExileNineteen No, i mean just attack then give up right after and try to grind it out like that with 1 health. Unless you can't give up against rico
[4:14:05] <Electro96> woolie could get lucky and duplicate elixirs
[4:14:05] <+Vigonept> your youthful soul ain't filled with bitch
[4:14:06] <alexandrecau> Woolie you won't be able to gain town if you die
[4:14:09] <Darren716> Jetzord Minh and woolie were in the backdown arc
[4:14:10] <%emperordread> Woolie already committed to staying in Heck till the deed is done, good luck to him
[4:14:11] <%zenith0111> Minh should've bought elixers
[4:14:12] <%hamahiroyuki> just get into a low level battle and take hits until that stupid nitro triggers
[4:14:13] <+Tennochief> @jetzord just big cowardly moves and giving up
[4:14:13] <+pectusumbra> if he waits long enough to die he can just pop back as darklington
[4:14:14] <$TIME_PUNCHER> Rob that binch
[4:14:17] <%nintega010> yeah cause I don't know how big the bonus is and killing reggie is more profitable at this moment
[4:14:18] <%paladinstarbuster> GO TO GRAVAT
[4:14:21] <%C4m3r0n0409> Shouldve gave up on Rico
[4:14:22] <Mr_Ease> its not that high, its 1/4 th of his towns, and given that he's given up his towns already and lost some to charm potions, it would be even less
[4:14:26] <%jiggy_snipe> not terrible
[4:14:27] <shameimarusen> Never be game over
[4:14:28] <%zenith0111> GRAVAT
[4:14:29] <smackdownbeef> Swamp?
[4:14:30] <%Grayhammatter> go to GRAVATT
[4:14:31] <%Amaideus> Honestly Woolie's in a position to kingmaker

[4:14:38] <mrblack499> what ch they on
[4:14:39] <%tearknack> @Jetzord minh's stocking up on bs, Reggie's still in the lead, woolie is in the final dungeon, underequippped, underlevveled, with 1 health
[4:14:42] <%Th3SmartAlec> FINALLY
[4:14:44] <smackdownbeef> Send the dog
[4:14:44] <%Amaideus> The other two can fight forever, but he can get himself poised to end
[4:14:46] <%C4m3r0n0409> Woolie might as well go darkling and restart the world
[4:14:46] <whisperstatic> SEND DOG
[4:14:47] <Shishi1205> lmao
[4:14:48] <Sanwanchez> YES
[4:14:49] <ExileNineteen> @krispen_wa i do not actually know if give up is an option with rico sr. that might work, because if he does that it's on the other two to jump in and snipe the win from him
[4:14:52] <%Grayhammatter> send the dog as well?
[4:14:55] <+Tennochief> SEND DOG
[4:14:56] <%heroversusofficial> SEND DOG

[4:39:39] <ExileNineteen> they probably won't go longer than that
[4:39:41] <+UnderseaMagic> it was inevitable, no way could reggie stay in 1st. guy's got no tactical thinking
[4:39:41] <+Dimfish> minh getting that good weapon was his luckiest bit, the rest was all strategy
[4:39:43] <zocano> He couldn't do anything
[4:39:44] <mar_krow> The good stuff
[4:39:44] <%jiggy_snipe> Reggie would have to chase Minh without gear or at least without a weapon

[4:41:14] <Darren716> Woolie needs to go darkling and wipe away all towns
[4:41:16] <%yeetdabsenpai69> @th3smartalec I hope so cause it would actually be the best move
[4:41:18] <ExileNineteen> when he ends the game he will drown in salt

[4:43:58] <BakerBrute> Somebody explain this to me please. How does the game end?
[4:44:03] <neraren> This has gotten less fun when everyone wants to die
[4:44:05] <SGrim> Remember when Woolie was winning at the start of this?
[4:44:06] <%Nekros4442> THAT DIDNT LAST LONG
[4:44:06] <%yeetdabsenpai69> DARKLINGTON MUST RISE AND DESTROY ALL IN HIS WAY
[4:44:09] <%Amaideus> @BakerBrute When they kill the last boss
[4:44:10] <DSD24> "They fact that I am alive might complicate things"
[4:44:11] <%Grayhammatter> or one darkling
[4:44:11] <%tearknack> @BakerBrute kill the boss
[4:44:12] <%Th3SmartAlec> @BakerBrute Overlord Rico is in Heck, kill him to end
[4:44:14] <%pyrotherian> Probably when Rico gets beat up
[4:44:14] <gekizenbu> @BakerBrute when the game takes their souls
[4:44:16] <thesickestzak> He cant keep getting away with it! nliLUL

[4:44:26] <+Vigonept> wait for Minh to go to hrll and cleanup
[4:44:27] <smackdownbeef> They keep letting him get away with it
[4:44:27] <%emperordread> What a rollercoaster of emotions this has been FOR A WATCHER. Those boys are all putting themselves through hell for this LP <3
[4:44:28] <%jiggy_snipe> Minh won't ever go ton heck watch
[4:44:28] <%C4m3r0n0409> STONKS
[4:44:30] <%preppyposs> darklington dhouls target reggie exclusively
[4:44:30] <ExileNineteen> i say woolie because no one else gives two shits about ending the game
[4:44:32] <%gutlesscoward> why does he need to get a passport? woolie's winning the game for him

[4:44:53] <ExpressNode> I feel that tension
[4:44:53] <Heartless_01> that was a rough as fuck session
[4:44:54] <+TheBigTaco> suffering
[4:44:57] <speximillian> Minh keeps coming through with those Charm Potions and winning
[4:44:57] <%preppyposs> NOTHING TO SAY

[4:44:59] <%heroversusofficial> !uptime
[4:44:59] <%Grayhammatter> the give up arc
[4:44:59] <%zenith0111> They look emotionally dead
[4:44:59] <%tearknack> GIVE UP ARC
[4:44:59] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 45 minutes
[4:45:00] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> So..... we all good
[4:45:01] <sniffy77> this is the game that doesn't end. it just goes on and on my friends

[4:45:04] <%Livelinne> Eyyy
[4:45:04] <smackdownbeef> At this point, literally no one deserves this win more than Minh.
[4:45:05] <Chipshandon12> woolie back to hollowed out
[4:45:06] <昼寝の神様> woolie is just a husk right now LUL
[4:45:07] <golfclubabby> So much for ending the session
[4:45:07] <aiutare47> This is some JoJo level shit. It’s going to be 40 years till dokapon ends.
[4:45:08] <%Superdandy96> Minhister of Evil and his Minhions are running wild!
[4:45:09] <thesickestzak> Never stop giving up! Always back down!
[4:45:10] <lotharrio> If I were Minh, I'd just keep stocking up on Charm Potions and wait for everyone else to go to Heck, so I could steal their towns while they try to be heroes.
[4:45:10] <+dmtjinni> THE GIVEN UP ARC
[4:45:11] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> Fucking rooooough
[4:45:11] <%Jetzord> Jetzord subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Thanks for the stream! Reggie didn't get what he wanted but he did get what he deserved. Despite that I'm still Reggie Gang
[4:45:15] <morningmoondude> they meant that when you start getting alchemy, the players will be broken
[4:45:16] <ExileNineteen> nah they'll do one more, woolie will study up and be prepared to descend through heck
[4:45:16] <+Artemis_Scowl> The tension is PALPABLE
[4:45:17] <%tearknack> @sniffy77 some people started playing it not knowing what it was
[4:45:21] <Them00n> Everyone is just depressed, winning doesn't even feel good anymore.
[4:45:25] <%C4m3r0n0409> THAT WAS STRESSFUL
[4:45:26] <+conradical> does woolz have a big hole in his shirt?
[4:45:27] <%nintega010> @WoolieVersus That was rough for you Woolie you try harder than most, but the game hates you
[4:45:28] <smackdownbeef> 0 Time Darkling Minh can't be put down
[4:45:29] <%zenith0111> Now we're back to square one

[4:45:42] <Chipshandon12> we need a darklington world shake up
[4:45:44] <%JeoDood> remember buying that passport was a bad idea LUL
[4:45:44] <+prime_name> Can we stop now?
[4:45:44] <thesickestzak> I'm sure it will feel good for whoever wins that $4000
[4:45:45] <%phatmac16> Minh won
[4:45:45] <%SuperKirby24> Are we reaching omikron levels of burnt out? NotLikeThis
[4:45:45] <Pistachius> jnbT talk2tPunk
[4:45:46] <+Dimfish> minh still never gone darkling, hes the true hero
[4:45:49] <golfclubabby> Minh is going to win isn't he?
[4:45:50] <SGrim> Join us next Thrusday, where someone dies! woopsAh
[4:45:51] <%jiggy_snipe> remember Minh knew about alchemist Kappa
[4:45:53] <DerpioParty> They just need to make progress instead of worrying about towns that they'll probably lose
[4:45:55] <zipperdude33> woolieYE
[4:45:56] <%phatmac16> MINH WON
[4:45:56] <%Jetzord> Karma's balancing everything out

[4:46:12] <%0rond> this is like being level 1 in DND
[4:46:12] <thesickestzak> The future refused to change!
[4:46:13] <golfclubabby> Minh is inevitable
[4:46:14] <Duke_of_HI> Sleepover for next Session right? Kappa
[4:46:17] <+dmtjinni> MINH GANG
[4:46:17] <+TheBigTaco> THIS IS HOW WE WIN
[4:46:17] <emeraldskrull> Reggie has to rebound woolieDATTEBAYO
[4:46:18] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> FILLER HELL ARC
[4:46:19] <ExileNineteen> i said minh couldn't do it all session but i underestimated how much $$$ is bound up in australia
[4:46:21] <%Superdandy96> Karma giveth, karma taketh
[4:46:24] <昼寝の神様> thats what he gets for hating sneks LUL
[4:46:24] <%irfan_> MINH GANG
[4:46:27] <speximillian> If Woolie goes Darkling, Reggie can maybe win
[4:46:27] <%shanedelbon> !uptime
[4:46:28] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 4 hours and 46 minutes
[4:46:31] <+velestionhammer> Eventually, Reggie stopped thinking.
[4:46:31] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:46:31] <%gatorafan> Woolie on the eternal giveup room
[4:46:33] <BurningSaph> The Gold Experience Requiem
[4:46:33] <golfclubabby> And Reggie just completely failed this whole session
[4:46:40] <alrobot2014> funny how you can only escape hell by dying
[4:46:53] <RunoEddie> Woolie is Snake in the microwave hallway
[4:46:54] <RurouniGeo> Woolie's best play is to die and force minh to pay to get into heck and just go get the Robo-Knight class instead of ending the game
[4:46:57] <昼寝の神様> MIIIIITCH
[4:47:05] <%emperordread> @RunoEddie LUL
[4:47:05] <%dark_fire_fly> What a MITCH DIGGER move.
[4:47:06] <%jiggy_snipe> did Minh really think Woolie could just go through heck and the castle like that
[4:47:11] <ExileNineteen> unfortunately for the viewers, the actual best play is to stall
[4:47:18] <maznuts> THE MITCH DIGGER MOVE-WOOLIE 2020
[4:47:18] <%nintega010> @RurouniGeo yeah
[4:47:25] <%Amaideus> Well the first time Woolie was in a better position
[4:47:26] <LVDoomien> did Soushin win the blood pool yet
[4:47:34] <ExpressNode> But a bug ate your shit
[4:47:34] <smackdownbeef> The best play was buying shit tons of charm potions, really
[4:47:34] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> No reason to go into Heck
[4:47:35] <%nintega010> @ExileNineteen for woolie yes
[4:47:36] <%Amaideus> Going back in without ANYTHING was the downfall
[4:47:42] <Lichzim> Fortune Street when
[4:47:47] <Chipshandon12> its on first place to try and end game when they can. maybe lower if you think the reward will push you into first
[4:47:51] <%tearknack> @LVDoomien i'd say 2-3 sessions left
[4:47:53] <%GenesisKnight> In the end it doesn't even matter
[4:47:58] <BakerBrute> Stage ??? Acceptance
[4:47:58] <%hamahiroyuki> we started with pressure rising indefenitivelly and now ends with they dying inside, just not as bad as when we finished naruto
[4:47:58] <%jiggy_snipe> might as well leave heck and cause darkling chaos
[4:47:59] <smackdownbeef> Man this game fucked with everyone this session
[4:48:05] <+Dimfish> if dokapon didnt break them fortune street wong
[4:48:05] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> @chipshandon12 Absolutely
[4:48:11] <+Dimfish> *wont
[4:48:12] <%jiggy_snipe> game won't end til someone goes through hell
[4:48:15] <speximillian> The Give Up Arc going strong
[4:48:24] <昼寝の神様> I love how its woolie that goes in first and ends up eating shit and end up being 3rd LUL
[4:48:25] <BakerBrute> Whats the blood pool look like?
[4:48:25] <%gatorafan> Minh is fine :)
[4:48:33] <%SuperKirby24> man, the game just assaulted everyone this session NotLikeThis
[4:48:34] <%heroversusofficial> Feelsgoodman
[4:48:38] <patrickIy> Dokapon giveth and Dokapon taketh away
[4:48:39] <%preppyposs> minjh is the only one who deserves to win
[4:48:40] <RurouniGeo> @jiggy_snipe the contract can be delivered to the last place player in any dungeon or yellow space
[4:48:43] <%preppyposs> he's making all the right moves
[4:48:48] <golfclubabby> I really don't want the villain to win PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[4:48:50] <%Superdandy96> We need more Dokapon fan art. This shit’s amazing
[4:48:52] <%Grayhammatter> that epidemic was so bad
[4:48:55] <zocano> As long as minh wins, I'm all good
[4:48:58] <ExileNineteen> woolie started 3rd and ended 3rd, hell doesn't have much $$$-making opportunities
[4:48:59] <zocano> wait
[4:49:01] <zocano> no
[4:49:03] <RurouniGeo> @preppyposs none of them deserve to win per se
[4:49:11] <zocano> as long as he loses, I'm happy
[4:49:12] <smackdownbeef> I want the person who will make the most amount of people salty to win tbh
[4:49:14] <koolaid_kevster> You guys looks Handsome!
[4:49:18] <%b_aleph> Die Minh, Die
[4:49:22] <%b_aleph> It's a german band
[4:49:25] <%tearknack> @ExileNineteen wasn't woolie 2nd at the start?
[4:49:30] <+Dimfish> love my boy minh
[4:49:30] <BurdRightsActivist> "looks handsome"
[4:49:30] <+Tennochief> it's fun
[4:49:30] <%ShadowpulseKDH1> @smackdownbeef Problem is, I think that’s everyone
[4:49:30] <koolaid_kevster> hope your having fun!
[4:49:36] <zocano> @smackdownbeef honestly that's probably Woolie
[4:49:38] <@chesterr01> @koolaid_kevster HeyGuys
[4:49:40] <%0rond> wait BNA is fully released?
[4:49:43] <%Superdandy96> Pockets is literally in hell while Kicks and Minh are in the middle of a slap fight.
[4:49:44] <%nintega010> @smackdownbeef that would be Woolie. Cause everyone wants woolie to lose
[4:49:45] <%gatorafan> Dokapon ain't no place for a hero
[4:49:46] <hawmaro95> Minh is the best
[4:49:54] <ExileNineteen> @tearknack i think you're correct, minh had darkling as an option early i think
[4:49:54] <%zenith0111> Bloodpool groweth
[4:49:55] <smackdownbeef> Then Woolie should win
[4:50:03] <zocano> Good
[4:50:04] <koolaid_kevster> I learned that word
[4:50:05] <ExileNineteen> it wasn't a big difference between 2nd/3rd but yeah
[4:50:13] <+dmtjinni> Dokapon is a RELIGION
[4:50:20] <%SuperKirby24> There is no good and evil in dokapon: only winners and losers here LUL
[4:50:25] <RurouniGeo> Will the Blood Pool be over or under $5000 by the end of the game?
[4:50:31] <zocano> It's like Mario Party Party, the guy playing to win is the one that deserves to lose the most
[4:50:38] <ExileNineteen> well it just went to 4k so
[4:50:42] <mistersups> Blood or Peace?
[4:50:46] <%b_aleph> Dokapon is.
[4:50:48] <smackdownbeef> There are no heroes left in a man
[4:50:48] <%gatorafan> @superkirby24 for here... THE MIGHTY RULE daedra1DrunkTibs
[4:50:57] <%ekodrop> i think it's just under 4k
[4:50:58] <%preppyposs> I think minh has played the game perfectly so far and hasn't made dumb moves that's set him in third place, not to mention he hasn't display sore winner tendencies (ie. he doesn't bemoan that he's in first)
[4:51:00] <%hamahiroyuki> also, will we address the matter of reggie wandering aimless without a plan?
[4:51:09] <%iswearimjustdandy> I believe in woolie #wooliegang
[4:51:12] <RurouniGeo> @b_aleph Darkseid was born in Dokapon
[4:51:15] <%kyh9> Beyond time and space
[4:51:23] <zocano> @preppyposs He absolutely does and how you don't notice is telling

[4:51:59] <$Futurecity10> outlaw star is overrated and stupid
[4:52:03] <mistersups> A Boy has a right to dream...
[4:52:05] <%jiggy_snipe> @preppyposs Minh has been making the correct plays but he also had more knowledge. he was gonna go acrobat and knew how to get it and then changed his mind and went alchemist instead
[4:52:06] <%tearknack> @preppyposs minh makes bad moves, but much less regularly than his foes
[4:52:07] <%phatmac16> Good OP

[4:52:39] <%KingLlama1> the Caster is an OP weapon
[4:52:55] <BurdRightsActivist> @Futurecity10 no you
[4:52:59] <zocano> Reggie is the one most obviously just kinda playing and wanting to have fun and why he's the most deserving of the W
[4:53:07] <%preppyposs> I think it's because minh doesn't overthink things

[4:53:44] <Picosunloaded> how about limited items at the shop

[4:54:18] <+greatmonorail> Minh hustled the most but can't escape from luck
[4:54:29] <%gatorafan> I think that after this session even if you die, you will die STANDING
[4:54:34] <%Superdandy96> Reggie is the child of Lucky Ted.

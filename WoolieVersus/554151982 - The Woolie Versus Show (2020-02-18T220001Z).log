[0:47:02] <peachy996> It's dodgy
[0:47:03] <+D4C_Trice> @WoolieVersus if you want more glorious shootbangs then try out the wolfenstein stuff by machine games

[0:47:11] <stranger59> I just ate chicken, that Imp looks tasty
[0:47:12] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lucky
[0:47:13] <Vyneci> You should give arcade mode a try one day off stream, it's pretty fun
[0:47:14] <sunsetserenity1> Play multiplayer cowards
[0:47:14] <SheefEatsBeef> bethesda softworks
[0:47:16] <+Neoepochx> that is super weird

[0:47:30] <pillowwasp> Multiplayer sucks
[0:47:35] <whazat> this game is extremely held together with scotch tape

[0:47:42] <Vyneci> #BlameSatan
[0:47:54] <+commanderclaw> Karma is eastern
[0:47:54] <stranger59> More curious how multiplayer will be in Eternal
[0:47:54] <@Solidus_113> The satan that is Bethesda
[0:47:56] <+Neoepochx> Multiplayer got better, still pretty standard though
[0:47:56] <BallerSwagBro9k> Thats Hindu
[0:47:58] <+YabbaTroll> satan also known as Todd Howard
[0:47:59] <NZolozabal> @WoolieVersus Yo Woolie! I found out that Persona 5 Royal is being censored! ResetEra demanded that they take out that gag involving the two gay guys hitting on Ryuji and the protagonist.
[0:48:00] <%ChoculaUltra> there's actually some crazy ass lore in a few of the multiplayer maps iirc
[0:48:06] <%FuqBoiSlim> This game had multiplayer??
[0:48:07] <GarbageNirvana> Gotta get the rest of that lore
[0:48:07] <Mudstone12> multiplayer is has hackers now
[0:48:09] <MayorRev> the bibble LUL
[0:48:15] <+krispen_wa> So that means we got to erase Christianity
[0:48:16] <+tearknack> that's a retcon actually
[0:48:19] <peachy996> Karma is God going "I did that"
[0:48:20] <+krispen_wa> so everyone gets saved
[0:48:21] <%Irridium> so spreading the word of god basically fucks people over?
[0:48:21] <dukenux> FUCK
[0:48:26] <Dirksolomon> did the multiplayer have some stupid loadouts btw?
[0:48:32] <+Neoepochx> yep
[0:48:37] <+linSP> why not keep god a secret then
[0:48:38] <+Neoepochx> @dirksolomon it does
[0:48:42] <Dirksolomon> oh no
[0:48:42] <dekkitout> Rigged!
[0:48:42] <1matheuw> straitght to the fire pits with you
[0:48:42] <+johnny_gogo> WHAT if you cant read
[0:48:48] <%Irridium> spreading the word of god is literally the worst thing you can do to your fellow man
[0:48:50] <dukenux> "Why did ya spill the beaaaans?"
[0:48:51] <Snakes_dk> What if you cant read
[0:48:51] <%GeneralSCPatton> UNLIMITED VICTIM-BLAMING-WORKS!
[0:48:57] <GarbageNirvana> God traps
[0:48:58] <awalr> hide bibles to save their souls
[0:48:58] <whazat> nothing to spend
[0:49:01] <%mh9s> Mormons be placing hotel bibbles too
[0:49:07] <+commanderclaw> Doesn't that make proselytyzing evil then? Cause it sends people to hell?
[0:49:07] <kingra> @johnny_gogo Then a priest will read it for you
[0:49:08] <sunsetserenity1> This sounds like an SCP
[0:49:15] <dukenux> As long as you don't hear a word "Jesus" you're fine
[0:49:18] <%JetpackMcQuack> Y'all aren't gonna out logic them
[0:49:20] <BioApple> oh hey he did get those headshots, gj
[0:49:26] <RunningNGunning> The demo for this game was Multiplayer only, it was so mediocre that people thought that this game was going to be lame
[0:49:30] <+krispen_wa> So the ultimate sacrifice is to take your knowledge of god with you to the grave, damning your soul but saving others
[0:49:30] <+johnny_gogo> FUCK i thought i was safe
[0:49:32] <Joestar1890> @NZolozabal Gonna side with ResetEra on this one, that scene was cringe and kinda inappropriate considering it takes place after Kamoshida's dungeon

[0:50:45] <dukenux> @commanderclaw sounds like something missions should account for, yeah
[0:50:48] <1matheuw> nope
[0:50:48] <ihateyouo> no
[0:50:49] <unit24> you did not
[0:50:51] <Hawkbone_> No
[0:50:52] <Joestar1890> @Neoepochx Understandable. Also, you could always direct message me on Twitch.
[0:50:54] <%Irridium> you did not
[0:50:57] <+tearknack> did not
[0:51:01] <FirewallStorm> you didn't
[0:51:08] <NZolozabal> @Joestar1890 I respectfully disagree with the decision. There are plenty of gay people who love the game series that I've shared this scene with and they thought it was the funniest thing.
[0:51:09] <venomfury86> A bug caused me to lose around 20% of my progress once, it sucked
[0:51:15] <FirewallStorm> next page
[0:51:40] <Joestar1890> @savagedeviljayho Yeah, I don't like it either, but I really didn't like that scene.

[1:05:17] <GarbageNirvana> Gonna get up in them guts
[1:05:17] <DXLelouch24> Doomguy has a picture of Daisy in his Fortress of Doom in Eternal, its basically confirmed Slayer and Doomgy are one and the same

[1:05:40] <Ceroical> @DXLelouch24 He also has his old armour on display, pretty sure you can unlock it too
[1:06:01] <+Neoepochx> There are a lot more hints, but that is spoiler territory
[1:06:20] <+Neoepochx> Like...a lot more hints, especially in the artbook
[1:06:27] <%SilverInferno3> Hell energy can’t be bad, it made VEGA after all
[1:06:41] <Ceroical> It also made everything else happen LUL
[1:06:42] <%ChoculaUltra> I am kind've curious as to how the Hell energy scales. Like how long would a AA battery made of hell juice last
[1:06:51] <SheefEatsBeef> vega is for real the big brain
[1:06:57] <Sapphire_Breeze> big brain
[1:07:08] <+Neoepochx> Monsters
[1:07:25] <+richter_the_d> Yo, how's the demonic genocide going? smonroThink
[1:07:25] <vulkans2> all I want to know is how long would hell energy be able to power my Game Gear
[1:07:42] <+Neoepochx> The problem with Argent is HOW it isnmade
[1:07:46] <Hawkbone_> @richter_the_d Finished the game, now reading lore.
[1:07:46] <Lightraven_> @richter_the_d He beat the game
[1:07:54] <%SilverInferno3> I’m pinning that on Olivia @ceroical, a cyborg wouldn’t have done all that
[1:07:55] <+richter_the_d> Neat
[1:07:58] <BioApple> @ChoculaUltra i think one of the lore entries spells it out but I don't remember what the numbers were
[1:08:11] <SheefEatsBeef> so that's how you explain life steal cool
[1:08:11] <%LeumasAsrov> LeumasAsrov subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:08:15] <dekkitout> Hell magnets, how do they work?
[1:08:28] <+jrogers629> In 2016 they we'rent the same originally . It was intended to be a full reboot but because of fan demand because Doomslayer is made to be Doom guy
[1:08:34] <Belutima> @dekkitout HA woopsKek
[1:08:35] <psychotripstreams> Even though this is all nonsense science-fantasy, the fact that they thought this out if fascinating.
[1:08:35] <%SilverInferno3> So he didn’t know huh
[1:08:50] <+Neoepochx> @jrogers629 there were hints in 2016
[1:08:54] <psychotripstreams> ^
[1:09:01] <whazat> pinkies definitely taste like pork
[1:09:03] <+Neoepochx> especially in the tapestry that shows doomguy
[1:09:04] <venomfury86> Pinky is food in hell
[1:09:05] <dekkitout> Yum
[1:09:06] <1matheuw> he is a snacc
[1:09:18] <+Neoepochx> Eternal is way more overt.
[1:09:24] <Hawkbone_> @jrogers629 Thats not true, there are tons of hints in 2016 that suggest he's the same
[1:09:34] <+jrogers629> And cause a lot of fans did not like Doom 3
[1:09:43] <unit24> this is what happens when you drink too much milk
[1:09:50] <Hawkbone_> Would Paige fuck a Revenant>
[1:09:53] <SheefEatsBeef> THANK U MR SKELTAL
[1:09:59] <+코코꾸라> DOOT
[1:10:01] <Lightraven_> @jrogers629 They've been calling him doomguy since before 2016 came out. They were always the same.
[1:10:02] <+Neoepochx> Doom 3 doomgut looks completely different
[1:10:03] <whazat> no ill effects besides 3 weeks of horrible pain
[1:10:06] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> paige no
[1:10:10] <siamzero94> Paige: SPLOOOOSH
[1:10:11] <joniroquai> Literally Skeleton Warrior
[1:10:14] <peachy996> @Hawkbone_ Too much meat on his bones I bet
[1:10:15] <Wooliam> Yea but jetpack tho
[1:10:16] <%GeneralSCPatton> @jrogers629 It was alright as a spook-shooter, but not as a Doom.
[1:10:17] <Joestar1890> But JETPACKS
[1:10:19] <fist_wizard_jay> DO YOU FEEL LIKE A HERO WOOLIE
[1:10:19] <+코코꾸라> Paige don't look
[1:10:20] <+YabbaTroll> jetpack tho
[1:10:21] <dekkitout> So Pat-Revenant would be 5"9' tops
[1:10:21] <%SilverInferno3> I can name at least one ill effect
[1:10:22] <SheefEatsBeef> WOULD YOU DO IT FOR A JETPACK
[1:10:22] <%jinking79> and u can play as one too
[1:10:23] <SaltyAzteca> ITS FIIIIIINE
[1:10:23] <zaitje> all that for a jetpack
[1:10:25] <Drchandragupta> Doom 3 was underrated as a doom game and BFG edition ruins it don't @ me
[1:10:33] <peachy996> But the Jetpack Woolie
[1:10:39] <peachy996> Think of the cool Jetpack

[1:23:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> Cheer500 Not only is the speedrun canon, but it's the 100% one! Also, pretty much all Doom 1+2 WADs are canon as his "rancor between worlds and through time". The fan maps really happened, meaning he takes a vacation in H-Doom to enjoy some muscly demon girls.
[1:24:01] <+WarbossMetal> The doom slayer betrayed the night sentinels, and in penance he was banished to hell

[1:29:00] <joylent_blue> cuz video game armor needs to look cool
[1:29:03] <joylent_blue> and unique
[1:29:08] <Sedrelic> cus satan is cooler
[1:29:08] <+tearknack> i mean people really don't know where the origins of paladins is
[1:29:09] <trianglehat> because boss drops are often themed after the boss as opposed to the one supposed to wear it
[1:29:13] <joniroquai> Clearly hasn't seen Paladin Judgement Armour in WoW
[1:29:18] <+tearknack> legends of charlmagne's knights and all that shit
[1:29:21] <dekkitout> Paragons are REALLY GOOD for pr
[1:29:25] <Hawkbone_> The devil is cooler than God
[1:29:38] <Dova573> Looks Cooler
[1:29:40] <RyansTryin> imagine if the UAC people had moved the armor to the end of the first level. gotta fight through the entirety of the first level naked
[1:29:41] <+tearknack> it has very little to do with the dnd interpretation (and nothing to do with the crusades)
[1:29:50] <BioApple> an rpg where your armor was rewarded to you by your patron instead of dropped from the boss would be pretty cool tho

[1:32:22] <joylent_blue> .....don't worry about it
[1:32:25] <peachy996> Maybe boys too you don't know
[1:32:25] <%LeumasAsrov> Hentai Doom
[1:32:28] <fist_wizard_jay> WADs = custom maps
[1:32:29] <dukenux> Don't worry about HDoom
[1:32:29] <%Solidnick18> muscle demon gir's?
[1:32:30] <+코코꾸라> It means every fan expansion of DOOM is technically canon
[1:32:32] <dekkitout> Those are words
[1:32:32] <+ComradePenguin> .wads are the file type for doom maps.
[1:32:33] <peachy996> Summoner is a guy now
[1:32:36] <vulkans2> you should look it up
[1:32:37] <awalr> you gon learn
[1:32:39] <+Neoepochx> domt confuse him
[1:32:40] <+ComradePenguin> you could build custom wads
[1:32:41] <%Kalinflip> chat uses Ancient doom speak and laughs at wollie for not knowing
[1:32:45] <%Kalinflip> atpCap
[1:32:47] <dukenux> oh it goes beyond Ecchi
[1:32:48] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus So here's a cool tidbit you might not be aware of, Hugo Martin, the Creative Director on Doom 2016 and now Eternal actually did a stint in the movie industry before starting work on this game, and he worked on designing these little things called Jägers for a certain movie by the name of Pacific Rim, and he MAY OR MAY NOT be leveraging some of that design talent in Eternal. And yes, in the trailers you do see a full on Titan roaming around the ruins of Earth.
[1:32:49] <unit24> that's a whole lot of words
[1:32:51] <+SirGO0SE> woolie pls google hdoom
[1:32:51] <%SlickRick11211> dam this camera is amazing
[1:32:52] <DedlokPM> @WoolieVersus WAD is the file type used for custom maps for ID games, like Doom 1 and 2
[1:32:53] <CPTCarbine> What's up Woolie? Getting ready for Doom Eternal?
[1:32:54] <BioApple> remember to preorder the doom eternal deluxe edition for the hdoom dlc
[1:32:58] <%Kalinflip> fucking 200 word essays
[1:32:59] <+aceleapc> you should definitely stream H Doom
[1:33:05] <peachy996> @WoolieVersus Check your twitter later I'm going to send a mario video
[1:33:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> Cheer500 WADs are the mods and map packs for Doom 1 and 2. The 2016 lore descrubes hom going between worlds and through time. The fanmade maps all canonically happened. Including the hentai mod.

[2:04:19] <+FlameLoneWolf> H.P. Lovecraft would hate this screen
[2:04:24] <+griffball13> woolie was done streaming but he never shut it off it seems
[2:04:40] <+axellogic> We watch his suspicious activity
[2:04:40] <QaizerArt> I think his outro is supposed to auto-shut it off but it just borked
[2:04:54] <+griffball13> man 2 obs shut offs now this
[2:05:06] <+griffball13> Satan really has taken over
[2:05:09] <absolute_cagemony> okay im here

[2:16:35] <+FlameLoneWolf> In the end, the real Doom was in our hearts all along.
[2:16:39] <bear_breaker20> did some one say meta?

[2:17:43] <absolute_cagemony> So hey how about that discussion on the podcast about the vomiting cannibal holocaust?
[2:17:48] <+FlameLoneWolf> Woolie's balls are so exposed that he put them so close to the webcam that it's now a black screen.
[2:17:57] <Kiosaleth> LMAO
[2:17:58] <+FlameLoneWolf> We're all looking at a close up
[2:18:13] <bear_breaker20> Colonel : To begin with -- we're not what you'd call -- human. Over the past two hundred years -- A kind of consciousness formed layer by layer in the crucible of the White House. It's not unlike the way life started in the oceans four billion years ago. The White House was our primordial soup, a base of evolution -- We are formless. We are the very discipline and morality that Americans invoke so often. How can anyone hope to eliminate us? As long as this nation exists, so will we. Raiden : Cut
[2:18:13] <@Moobot> Please don't fill up the entire chat, @bear_breaker20
[2:18:23] <%ChoculaUltra> we've been inside Big the Cat the whole time.

[2:18:45] <outis94> Rip and screen tear?
[2:18:49] <bear_breaker20> Colonel : To begin with -- we're not what you'd call -- human. Over the past two hundred years -- A kind of consciousness formed layer by layer in the crucible of the White House.

[2:18:56] <+FlameLoneWolf> Ask Plague, absolute
[2:19:02] <bear_breaker20> It's not unlike the way life started in the oceans four billion years ago. The White House was our primordial soup, a base of evolution -- We are formless. We are the very discipline and morality
[2:19:16] <bear_breaker20> that Americans invoke so often. How can anyone hope to eliminate us? As long as this nation exists, so will we. Raiden : Cut the crap! If you're immortal, why would you take away individual freedoms and c
[2:19:23] <absolute_cagemony> Just dive out her vagina right into a diaper fetish
[2:19:28] <+griffball13> strands are keeping us connected
[2:19:32] <bear_breaker20> censor the Net? Rose : Jack, don't be silly. Colonel : Don't you know that our plans have your interests -- not ours -- in mind? Raiden : What? Rose : Jack, listen carefully like a good boy! Colonel
[2:19:37] <SilverFaustX> is this a social experiment
[2:19:41] <absolute_cagemony> We were the ropey strands we made along the way
[2:19:46] <bear_breaker20> : The mapping of the human genome was completed early this century. As a result, the evolutionary log of the human race lay open to us. Rose : We started with genetic engineering, and in the end,
[2:19:51] <+FlameLoneWolf> This stream is bleak like my life.

[2:08:41] <TeepPhoenix> Sakuya has literally attacks named after references to Dio
[2:08:42] <+RealThiele> that mspaint-ass teleportal
[2:08:52] <TeepPhoenix> I think one is even called "XXI- The WORLD"
[2:09:03] <hassanico2> It's just Sakuya's World
[2:09:11] <%Wool> Sakuya gets a lot of Dio moves in Soku, like knife counter
[2:09:27] <+RealThiele> lame it out
[2:09:27] <%RyTYoung> LUL LUL LUL
[2:09:28] <hassanico2> THE BAIT
[2:09:31] <MutedMimic> LUL
[2:09:44] <%MyNameIsRasus> Did they pick Sakuya already?
[2:09:46] <hassanico2> and I thought FotNS rounds were long LUL
[2:09:49] <TeepPhoenix> I wonder if this game has a story mode like Dong Dong
[2:09:51] <crimsonsaens> Of course Woolie plays the boss character
[2:09:51] <hassanico2> @MyNameIsRasus nope
[2:09:58] <+jetjagger222> the lighting on yukari makes the sprites look extra creepy

[2:10:17] <%ozmon> Wow demolished
[2:10:18] <tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus apparently the way to switch stages is from the options menu? dunno if you want to risk it though, can't find any instructions
[2:10:18] <+Debauchery_Man> does she have her train super?
[2:10:23] <BrazillianCara> The thing about Touhou is that they're ALL boss characters. Even the protagonists.
[2:10:31] <townzzzzz> LUL
[2:10:35] <%Wool> some are midboss characters
[2:10:39] <%FuqBoiSlim> if everyone's a boss character then no one is

[2:11:32] <%Wool> lmao this is Marisa's theme from GFW
[2:11:34] <%DatAsuna> Reimu's strongest power is basically canonical plot armor
[2:11:37] <Potatoidea> She's got the shmup moves
[2:11:41] <%PettyFunk> Whew, I saw Touhou and I was alarmed. Seeing that it's this is reassuring that Woolie hasn't fallen down an entirely new hole
[2:11:42] <@Solidus_113> SourPls
[2:11:44] <Vashido22> best girl yuugi PogChamp

[2:11:52] <+Debauchery_Man> mima will never come back
[2:11:52] <tearfuldevil> yeah one of the things i actually know about touhou is the music slaps
[2:11:57] <%ozmon> Turn a shmup into a fighting game, you'll not miss zoners\
[2:12:00] <+RealThiele> those cards deal like no damage
[2:12:01] <Vashido22> @lem______ thanks
[2:12:02] <%pectusumbra> Man this just reminds me of fighting Reimu is Luna Nights and holy shit that fight is rough
[2:12:05] <townzzzzz> wish they went with the joke that reimu would play like sol
[2:12:07] <lem______> reimu has too many projectiles
[2:12:08] <TeepPhoenix> Has Yuugi even been in a canon 2hu fighting game?
[2:12:08] <Potatoidea> The music is entirely why I know about Touhou
[2:12:13] <hassanico2> nope
[2:12:14] <Taarin> You KNOW they gave the MC some sauce
[2:12:16] <%BisoromiBear> next game for sure, mimabros
[2:12:18] <lem______> yugi is like a slow grappler
[2:12:21] <%MyNameIsRasus> What
[2:12:24] <%Solidnick18> why she turn giant
[2:12:27] <%Wool> oh can you graze through projectiles with the dash
[2:12:28] <%Solidnick18> lol
[2:12:30] <hassanico2> @WoolieVersus Let Reggie land a super!
[2:12:32] <Polarix64> I want Yuugi to crush my head with her powerful thighs.... I mean not the one from this game but the actual Yuugi lol
[2:12:32] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the lighting on the sprites is even different LUL amazing
[2:12:34] <%Wool> Yuugi is big strong punch girl
[2:12:40] <%ozmon> Now Reggie's truly just playing Touhou
[2:12:42] <lem______> but the grabs are weird
[2:12:42] <%Solidnick18> is it a grappler
[2:12:45] <%pectusumbra> Was she the one with the inversion power?
[2:12:49] <lem______> its a burst that you can combo from
[2:12:51] <lem______> and into
[2:12:55] <TeepPhoenix> I think that was Seiga
[2:12:56] <%PettyFunk> @Solidnick18 p sure she's an oni
[2:12:59] <Taarin> LUL
[2:13:00] <%Wool> Reimu's power is that she can float
[2:13:02] <Potatoidea> Inversion is someone else, might not be in this game
[2:13:05] <%pectusumbra> I think she has her own touhou fan game, Gensokyo Night Festival?
[2:13:06] <hassanico2> Yuugi has power over supernatural phenomena
[2:13:09] <Udongein_1> seija is the inverse girl
[2:13:10] <%ozmon> lol what
[2:13:13] <hassanico2> Seija is the inversion character and she's not in this
[2:13:18] <%Wool> Suika is Gensokyo Night Festival, another oni
[2:13:19] <%pectusumbra> ahhh, okay

[2:13:40] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> ADAPT
[2:13:40] <hassanico2> It's funny, Reimu in Touhou Fighters usually sucks but she's so OP here LUL
[2:13:42] <%MyNameIsRasus> LEARN THE MATCHUP
[2:13:44] <tearfuldevil> @Wool doesn't touhou like to get conceptual and shit with the powers? like, floating emans you can "float through life" metaphorically? I think i've ehard some weebs rant about this
[2:13:46] <%BurdRightsActivist> DONGLIKE

[2:13:51] <hassanico2> @WoolieVersus Try the red dress blonde maid
[2:13:52] <%MyNameIsRasus> MAID

[2:14:54] <devanmuse> the voice is mr zun touhou? or even the actor?
[2:14:58] <Emily_Luxnoire> this is pure Touhou
[2:14:58] <shaddydaddyo> i came here expecting touhou... i got touhou alright
[2:15:01] <%PettyFunk> I like that Not!Sakura's name is literally just MAHOU SHOUJO
[2:15:05] <+Debauchery_Man> remilia was always a low tier character
[2:15:07] <+jetjagger222> this is touhou at home
[2:15:15] <Taarin> Character development time spent in the oven ranges from well done to still bloody
[2:15:15] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:15:17] <%Wool> this is why Yuugi hasn't been in a game ever since
[2:15:18] <TeepPhoenix> GIVE HER A BREAK SHE'S DRUNK
[2:15:19] <+RealThiele> alcohol does not improve performance
[2:15:20] <%SilverRoddo> That‚Äôs a donator in the background?
[2:15:20] <+paladinstarbuster> does this game havea command list?
[2:15:33] <%Wool> @SilverRoddo that's Mima
[2:15:38] <@Solidus_113> Higurashi is a VN
[2:15:40] <Potatoidea> Friend of Umineko
[2:15:45] <digitalslime> prequel to umineko
[2:15:45] <%hamahiroyuki> the actual original creator of the touhou series? LUL
[2:15:45] <+paladinstarbuster> Diferent anime thing
[2:15:50] <@akuda_bar> novel that came out before umineko, basically.
[2:15:51] <tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus it by the umineko righter
[2:15:57] <%pectusumbra> Higurashi is When the Higurashi Cry. It's the thing that came BEFORE Umineko
[2:15:59] <tearfuldevil> writer
[2:16:01] <majindusto> Is this even Touhou?
[2:16:02] <devanmuse> higurashi - when they cry. you probably heard of it a good decade ago. horror anime
[2:16:04] <%SilverRoddo> Ah, thanks.
[2:16:05] <+PukingGoombas> A-are these men in tohou outfits
[2:16:06] <lem______> @Debauchery_Man Remilla is not low tier in soku, at al
[2:16:06] <0pirus> this is the true touhou
[2:16:07] <@Solidus_113> pretty decent anime too, at least the first 2 seasons
[2:16:07] <%MyNameIsRasus> this is that anime underbelly
[2:16:11] <Potatoidea> This is very much Touhou
[2:16:14] <%ozmon> Higurashi no Naku Koro ni?
[2:16:16] <@Solidus_113> yes
[2:16:17] <%Axle13j> (great VN btw. super cheap on steam)
[2:16:22] <%DatAsuna> it's pretty fucked up

[2:16:30] <hassanico2> @WoolieVersus Change of stages?
[2:16:30] <+bigdrifter> what in the cursed fuck is this
[2:16:35] <Potatoidea> All I know about Higurashi is that it's messed up and something about fingernails
[2:16:35] <townzzzzz> yooooooooooooooo
[2:16:36] <hassanico2> YES
[2:16:36] <%YakumoYomi> You hear that, chat? Woolie thinks he knows what Touhou is. That's cute.
[2:16:37] <%Irridium> so then hpps is from higurashi?
[2:16:38] <Emily_Luxnoire> Remilia died
[2:16:39] <%MonsieurHonHon> OOF
[2:16:39] <Mokoulishious> men in touhou outfits the only way to do it

[2:16:41] <@Solidus_113> woolieSHOOK woolieSHOOK
[2:16:41] <@akuda_bar> higurashi = horror VN about school kids. umineko = horror vn about fancy rich people.
[2:16:41] <%Solidnick18> this nightmare fuel
[2:16:42] <%Axle13j> LOLLLL
[2:16:42] <%MyNameIsRasus> that was.... sick?
[2:16:49] <%SilverRoddo> A into, B has cool-down
[2:16:50] <+Debauchery_Man> this is touhou, completely canon
[2:16:54] <%PettyFunk> I've always been distantly curious about Higurashi and Umineko. The latter has some bomb ass music though
[2:16:55] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> oh shit I'm taking some notes right now
[2:16:58] <%ozmon> Yeah, it's a super psychological horror business
[2:16:59] <spardanwarrior> Higurashi: When They Cry is a very nice visual novel where nothing bad ever happens.
[2:17:06] <%Axle13j> ^
[2:17:09] <+Debauchery_Man> really ZUN just stole the music and characters from this masterpiece
[2:17:10] <%Livelinne> this is sure a passion project clempsComfy
[2:17:10] <TeepPhoenix> Don't you like to the poeople like that
[2:17:13] <devanmuse> @akuda_bar Ciconia - horror vn about child soldiers
[2:17:15] <+paladinstarbuster> Why is Sakura from cardcaptor here?
[2:17:17] <Taarin> ATOMIC BUSTER
[2:17:18] <TeepPhoenix> *lie to the people
[2:17:27] <stabbityrabbit> Are there any women cosplaying the touhou characters in this game? Or do they stick hard to the theme.
[2:17:29] <hassanico2> Woolie making the Sake work!

[2:17:46] <%MyNameIsRasus> from such a height
[2:17:48] <hassanico2> NOICE
[2:17:49] <+jetjagger222> there's something vaguely disconcerting about the fire effects from that fireball
[2:17:50] <%SilverRoddo> Is the When They Cry the one with the needle in a food?

[0:20:57] <+DesertOfSand> @FlubbedPig Game audio was too loud before, and it was sort of overcompensated

[0:21:32] <%TeethMuncher> reggie plz
[0:21:38] <ChaotixSpark> phonon 3C is super negative and the hitbox is gradual, meaning it hits out further at later frame allow an easy assault confirm.

[0:23:59] <CalderGaming> thx
[0:24:02] <Smart_ZaK1> Wow the crossup
[0:24:10] <hoebag699> @chaotixspark he's a what now
[0:24:16] <niishucks> 214a is hitgrab
[0:24:20] <OkNow_64> Who’s ready for unicl-r
[0:24:21] <ChaotixSpark> He's a stand arrow. #ReadChronicles
[0:24:36] <hoebag699> ah
[0:24:40] <thecrabgodrulerofcrabs> i really like how the one whos downed gets back up after the victory pose
[0:24:43] <CalderGaming> unicl-r, where the in-births open an international clothing chain
[0:24:46] <Vashido22> Hit grab, long range normals, air fireball, mix, set ups, flight mode. anti air, safe reversal that leads into a combo, dive kick....merkava is the ultimate life form
[0:24:48] <%TeethMuncher> Real combos? In this economy?
[0:24:49] <ChaotixSpark> Once you get past Orie's chapter, the story picks up. But yeah, it starts off super slow.
[0:24:59] <%GunterDriger6> PogChamp
[0:24:59] <didgereedoodah> Orie is the first chapter
[0:25:09] <Smart_ZaK1> Fraudulent combos
[0:25:20] <Vashido22> @WoolieVersus game audio is low
[0:25:27] <didgereedoodah> audio
[0:25:30] <skewerstar> Love that the loser gets back up on his knees on a round loss. Nice touch!
[0:25:31] <+infeliciter> @WoolieVersus why no game audio?
[0:25:32] <CalderGaming> Under Night In-birth Quotidian Layer [Over]
[0:25:32] <Rosy_Joan> what audio?
[0:25:35] <ChaotixSpark> Correct didgeree. It's a really REALLY slow ass burn.
[0:25:37] <+ALTRNico> vorpal
[0:25:37] <RyuuAoi> Woolie, you got Progressive insurance? Cuz they support YOU.
[0:25:42] <shadowmaksim> The whip is a void in the shape of a snake.
[0:25:50] <ChaotixSpark> Moony~ <3
[0:26:03] <Ner234> Everytime I read this game's name I just get a good chuckle out of it.
[0:26:05] <Vashido22> good
[0:26:07] <+FRANKONTHEROCKS> play NOT mature
[0:26:13] <Nevicate> SourPls
[0:26:25] <Vashido22> huh
[0:26:29] <hoebag699> this pleases my ears
[0:26:30] <Vashido22> that's weird
[0:26:37] <RyuuAoi> Woolie, when's more Tetris?
[0:26:46] <giogio346> @WoolieVersus game too quiet
[0:26:53] <ChaotixSpark> huh. that's actually a little annoying.
[0:26:54] <Rosy_Joan> still quiet
[0:27:00] <anarchistPastry> we wanna hear those KREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEs
[0:27:04] <MTLxSpider> weird
[0:27:13] <KohryuZX> Woolie what was the deal with that whole thing about erections to sace lives in the podcast?
[0:27:14] <%TeethMuncher> the chosen one
[0:27:16] <ManOfReason> EA sports screen lol
[0:27:26] <+ALTRNico> Enkidu Kreygasm
[0:27:30] <haveswordmuststing> @kohryuzx GoT thing
[0:27:34] <RyuuAoi> MADDEN BOIS
[0:27:37] <KohryuZX> OOoh
[0:27:39] <CalderGaming> @KohryuZX if character A had been into character B in GoT everything would have gone a lot better

[0:27:44] <anarchistPastry> LOUDA
[0:27:46] <LandOfTheWay> i fucking love enkidu, but boy is this a bad matchup
[0:27:47] <+Mawari_> Waldstein <3
[0:27:48] <ChaotixSpark> STOP CHOOSING LAGGY STAGES >.<
[0:27:51] <KohryuZX> Oooooooooooooooooooooooh
[0:27:52] <Vashido22> #BuffEnkiduCLEAR
[0:27:58] <+javonero15> enkidu
[0:28:11] <KohryuZX> thanks chat i was about as lost as Pat in the podcast lol
[0:28:16] <haveswordmuststing> lose a lot and you stop caring
[0:28:20] <kaine_west> keep grinding bro
[0:28:22] <+DesertOfSand> We about to see some blowups from Enkidu IC5C
[0:28:23] <@Menitta> Try to think about what you learned from losing
[0:28:27] <ChaotixSpark> Enkidu actually has a few good choices. Frosty was grinding something out as Enkidu that i thought was super neat.
[0:28:30] <JamesSage> dont be such a little b*tch, that's my answer
[0:28:32] <%allouttajuice> @haveswordmuststing that's my life motto
[0:28:38] <KantusMonkus> all dem grd breaks oof
[0:28:52] <+ALTRNico> Johns
[0:28:59] <Rosy_Joan> team games are the worst because its hard to not turn that salt onto friendly fire
[0:29:02] <haveswordmuststing> ive played Team Fortress for years and never done good... than played cs go... took a break and somehow something clicked
[0:29:09] <hoebag699> every time you get bodied look at the invisible camera and make a funny face
[0:29:09] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:29:13] <Vashido22> taking breaks helps
[0:29:16] <Valtamus> damn, pat has hands
[0:29:19] <kenzaki_> Ayyyy, UNIST
[0:29:20] <Smart_ZaK1> REAL combos
[0:29:24] <Vashido22> if you're getting too salty, take a break from the game
[0:29:28] <Vashido22> it helps a lot
[0:29:29] <RyuuAoi> In video games, you should always learn from your mistakes. Dark Souls taught me that HARD.
[0:29:36] <%GunterDriger6> PogChamp
[0:29:37] <Siregulus> YOU STOLE MY WARPOL
[0:29:38] <%TeethMuncher> not his vore pal!
[0:29:39] <ghostravens> for me, as long as i had fun, win or lose, i'm fine
[0:29:42] <CalderGaming> taking the PAL out of VORPAL
[0:29:45] <DrBeefcastle> that was some pretty fucked up Enkidu
[0:29:46] <Vashido22> LUL
[0:29:48] <%GunterDriger6> LUL
[0:29:48] <hoebag699> BREAKDOWN BREAKDOWN
[0:29:51] <RyuuAoi> GOODT info, Woolie.
[0:29:53] <gordieda20> LUL
[0:29:55] <FlamingNarwhal> I just redefine my definition of a win and a loss. I see it as if I learn something it's a win.
[0:29:57] <ManOfReason> lol thats really good
[0:29:57] <%Toynota10> Is Enkidu top tier?
[0:29:59] <Nevicate> And they said it was a bad matchup for enkidu
[0:30:00] <JamesSage> if i feel like i learned something/got better i dont care about losing, to a fault, really
[0:30:02] <reiju_22> Game is too quiet @WoolieVersus
[0:30:03] <+UnU__> consider your opponent
[0:30:04] <+DesertOfSand> Enkidu is like bottom 2
[0:30:04] <%Toynota10> Everyone seems to like playing him
[0:30:06] <Vashido22> @WoolieVersus In that match, Iron Man ate the mix
[0:30:06] <haveswordmuststing> @toynota10 HELL no
[0:30:08] <+ALTRNico> It's like edge of tomorrow
[0:30:13] <%Toynota10> lol ok
[0:30:13] <+theunforgivingsquid> @ryuuaoi monster Hunter taught me that
[0:30:14] <%TeethMuncher> @WoolieVersus need more volume
[0:30:17] <%sou1less_> enkidu is bottom tier
[0:30:19] <RyuuAoi> FUCK Dr. Strange. He didn't do SHITE
[0:30:24] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> good advice
[0:30:26] <+MoonlightP> enkidu is supposedly the worst character in the game but people place insanely high with him
[0:30:28] <+Wyrmidon> it might also help to play in lobbies instead of ranked. when you lose points it is easier to get salty even if the points don't matter
[0:30:29] <+MoonlightP> says a lot about the kind of game unist is
[0:30:30] <ManOfReason> tell the TO "I went 1-14,000,000"
[0:30:33] <+DesertOfSand> The thing about Enkidu is that he's FUCKING COOL, and he still shits damage
[0:30:35] <RyuuAoi> @theunforgivingsquid Oh HELL YEAH
[0:30:43] <+DesertOfSand> The tiers in UNIST are pretty closely packed, so bottom 2 isn't unplayable by any means
[0:30:45] <haveswordmuststing> Enkidu is the best character bar none, but he's also the worst in game
[0:30:53] <+Checktrap> STOP DROPPING REGGIE !!!!!
[0:30:55] <Vashido22> NICE
[0:30:57] <TheGershon> Misra
[0:31:01] <TheGershon> Mista
[0:31:03] <Smart_ZaK1> 34 hits
[0:31:03] <KantusMonkus> enkidu's super is his only projectile
[0:31:03] <%Toynota10> @haveswordmuststing Good description
[0:31:13] <+6695HC> being bottom 2 doesn't matter when they're fucking cool
[0:31:16] <Vashido22> "I teched that"
[0:31:19] <FlamingNarwhal> question chat and or woolie. Is it worth picking up under night now or should i wait for the possible leaked "cl-r" version?
[0:31:19] <DrBeefcastle> I love watching good Enkidu players, he's so sick, I just don't have that kind of discipline
[0:31:19] <Vashido22> Kappa
[0:31:19] <Dean_Inbetween> teadouHypers
[0:31:22] <%Mawari_> Mawari_ subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:31:27] <+DesertOfSand> Yeah, I play Mika, who is the other half of bottom 2
[0:31:28] <kinbob99> Woolie VoHiYo
[0:31:32] <MrCJBubba> @6695HC yeah look at Shao Kahn and Kotal Kahn
[0:31:33] <giogio346> @WoolieVersus game is too quiet
[0:31:34] <+DesertOfSand> I wouldn't even dream of playing anyone else
[0:31:35] <%Mawari_> Gustav C Plus
[0:31:37] <haveswordmuststing> @6695hc which iwhy i perservere playing him... with an emergancy Nanase Kappa
[0:31:39] <hypecactuar> Yooooo
[0:31:39] <Vashido22> @FlamingNarwhal totally worth it now when its on sale, your knowledge of the game will pass into unclear
[0:31:39] <DrBeefcastle> I hope Enki gets some buffs in uniclr
[0:31:50] <didgereedoodah> yeah game still pretty quiet
[0:31:55] <DrBeefcastle> Also give my boy Gordon some extra buttons
[0:31:56] <Smart_ZaK1> Use that meter!
[0:32:01] <Dean_Inbetween> A dose of woolie helps the depression FrankerZ
[0:32:02] <+ZGoten> Bayonetta is a 3D Beat 'em Up, fight me
[0:32:02] <+MusouMiko> could use another 5-10% on the volume slider probably
[0:32:03] <+6695HC> I fucking love nanase's theme because of the salt it brings
[0:32:05] <ghostravens> important question that will determine whether i pick this game up or not: is there a gunslinger and/or a vampire character?
[0:32:08] <DrBeefcastle> c'mon French Bread you know you wanna give Gordon a projectile
[0:32:09] <+DesertOfSand> Lol going for the fucking counter
[0:32:09] <haveswordmuststing> Turn up the music Wools
[0:32:13] <foxhounder29> is ja rule the final boss?
[0:32:15] <Vashido22> LUL
[0:32:18] <%laserbeaming> Vanishment of VOID
[0:32:22] <Vashido22> Enkidu IS the struggle
[0:32:23] <MrEli111> I played against an Armoured King in Tekken7 and lost about 15 time in a row, and only cried for 30 minutes.
[0:32:28] <+Wyrmidon> @flamingnarwhal I'd say pick it up. most of what you learn will carry over to the next version
[0:32:33] <ChaotixSpark> Dash start up, throw across screen, and no plus frames on any of his moves.
[0:32:33] <haveswordmuststing> everything is unsafe with enkidu
[0:32:40] <beatie_g> enkidu is pretty punishable
[0:32:43] <Vashido22> bad frame data and lack of tools
[0:32:47] <reiju_22> @WoolieVersus CANT HEAR SHIT
[0:32:59] <%TeethMuncher> @WoolieVersus need more volume
[0:33:00] <ChaotixSpark> If he just had a better dash start up, i think he would be a fine character.
[0:33:04] <+Wyrmidon> and we don't have a release date for clr
[0:33:09] <@Solidus_113> yep
[0:33:09] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> it's fine
[0:33:11] <+Schiz_Turtles> volume is fine
[0:33:13] <@Solidus_113> it's been low
[0:33:13] <Vashido22> its fine
[0:33:14] <+SlowLikeThunder> volume is fine
[0:33:15] <Smart_ZaK1> It is still pretty quiet
[0:33:15] <ManOfReason> game audio
[0:33:16] <+Dre_> volume is fine
[0:33:16] <+MusouMiko> @WoolieVersus game needs like another 5%
[0:33:16] <+Checktrap> its fine
[0:33:17] <+Schiz_Turtles> ignore stoners
[0:33:17] <+DesertOfSand> Game is low
[0:33:17] <+ALTRNico> games too quiet
[0:33:18] <@Solidus_113> the game is low
[0:33:18] <reiju_22> game too low
[0:33:19] <fireking900> the game is quite
[0:33:20] <+marumariball> game audio a bit quiet
[0:33:20] <%SkaiVibration> game is low
[0:33:20] <+SlowLikeThunder> Dunno what that guy is talking about
[0:33:20] <Smart_ZaK1> the game
[0:33:20] <%GingaNZ> game is low
[0:33:20] <KeiPrime> wouldnt say cant hear the game, but the game is pretty low
[0:33:22] <anarchistPastry> turn up game a tad
[0:33:22] <+Seath_h> its fine
[0:33:24] <Goo_Ftroop> Kind of low, but not bad
[0:33:27] <@Menitta> uhhhh
[0:33:27] <LandOfTheWay> it's a little low, but it's fine
[0:33:27] <Laironx3> MIC IS FINE Game is kinda low
[0:33:29] <Vashido22> the game is KINDA low, but not bad
[0:33:32] <TheGershon> Game is LOW
[0:33:33] <+wardenofwinter> We good don’t know what her smoking
[0:33:34] <%Youknowwhyimhere008> too much and you can't hear them
[0:33:36] <OkNow_64> @flamingnarwhal I’d say get Unist because even if cl-r is real we know nothing about its release. It could come out in Japanese arcades first and get to us months later.
[0:33:36] <MTLxSpider> i hear game just very kiw
[0:33:37] <MTLxSpider> low
[0:33:38] <+NarcissistCactus> most people are saying game is low
[0:33:38] <+wardenofwinter> He
[0:33:38] <hypecactuar> game kinda low
[0:33:42] <LarryLemon> The game
[0:33:43] <Advent_Crusader> kinda low
[0:33:45] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @RyuuAoi
[0:33:47] <ChaotixSpark> Most people say its fine. "10 people say its not fine." Most people say its fine, sorry. Oof.
[0:33:47] <+MusouMiko> woolie only seeing what he wants to see 😔
[0:33:54] <Vashido22> @WoolieVersus Watch Enkidu be nerfed in unclear
[0:33:55] <giogio346> majority is saying low though LUL
[0:33:56] <RyuuAoi> @moobot Shut up
[0:34:06] <Smart_ZaK1> Remember, he only sees the one guy
[0:34:08] <+Cebardo> Enkidu still does well in tournaments
[0:34:09] <edwizzle43> It’s fine
[0:34:09] <+DesertOfSand> The biggest thing I want in UNICLR is for Mika to have a Vorpal Trait pls
[0:34:13] <%RioGascar> @woolieversus thoughts on samurai shodown giving season pass free with pre orders?
[0:34:13] <hoebag699> don't bully moobot
[0:34:14] <doodledumps> Mic volume is fine, game volume is a little low @WoolieVersus
[0:34:19] <hypecactuar> game a little low
[0:34:19] <+omegasis> Enkidu's fun, but gotta work hard to get in since dude got no range
[0:34:19] <ManOfReason> stream delay guys, he saw the its fine messages firt
[0:34:22] <Vashido22> @DesertOfSand yes please
[0:34:22] <@Solidus_113> trust in mods and spider, game is low
[0:34:26] <edwizzle43> Is rather here them any way
[0:34:30] <+Wyrmidon> @vashido22 I doubt that'd happen, the main Dev is an enkidu player
[0:34:32] <Vashido22> Mika is the character I went from hating to loving
[0:34:33] <+DesertOfSand> Ideally one that gives her more damage
[0:34:35] <ChaotixSpark> This game is way less about character strengths than in other games and more about player strengths.
[0:34:41] <%GunterDriger6> PogChamp
[0:34:42] <Vashido22> @Wyrmidon welp, buffs are welcome lmao
[0:34:44] <+DesertOfSand> Because she has good buttons, good pressure, an amazing dash, good oki
[0:34:44] <wolvenelf> yeyeye enkidu
[0:34:45] <+ALTRNico> BODIED
[0:34:46] <FlamingNarwhal> @Vashido22 @Wyrmidon @OkNow_64 crendorFrog1 gotcha. I'll keep an eye on it and pick it up when i have a chance. Was worried it'd be a once the new version's out the old is obsolete. and also didnt know what release schedule for under night is like thanks for the answer
[0:34:49] <%GunterDriger6> yeyeye!
[0:34:49] <+DesertOfSand> She's mainly just missing damage
[0:34:50] <+YeezusPieces1> Hood P
[0:34:51] <kaine_west> UNIST execution is so hard
[0:34:55] <thecrabgodrulerofcrabs> god damn
[0:34:57] <$FuqBoiSlim> B pknLUL DIED
[0:34:58] <+MusouMiko> well at least woolie's gonna lose fast so he can take another look at chat w
[0:35:01] <+DesertOfSand> Being 4-5 touch in a 3-4 touch game is tough
[0:35:13] <CalderGaming> 1-hit combo punish
[0:35:15] <haveswordmuststing> Enkidu could use a better dash block or some ways to punish the opponent EVEN HARDER, counters and havoc arent enough
[0:35:16] <Vashido22> @FlamingNarwhal no problem man, its a great game, so I really recommend it. And it's on sale pretty often
[0:35:17] <ChaotixSpark> What are you talking about? XD Mika has a lot of 3k combos.
[0:35:17] <+ALTRNico> 4B
[0:35:42] <Vashido22> Can't wait to spam XD on evo chat when Mika plays
[0:35:46] <+MusouMiko> not even mashing grab as merkava
[0:35:47] <niishucks> mash when you throw with merk
[0:35:48] <FlamingNarwhal> @Vashido22 yeeah ive seen it on sale a few times but just never really took the chance
[0:35:54] <+Cebardo> Primarily buff dash and some of Enk's framedata and he's fine
[0:35:56] <TheyCallMeVawn> Enkidu is sick
[0:36:00] <RyuuAoi> Well
[0:36:01] <Vashido22> Enkidu is sick af
[0:36:07] <ChaotixSpark> A majority of mika's game plan is momentum heavy and she's like one of those characters that is supposed to run a train on someone's wake up.
[0:36:12] <%GunterDriger6> Do it Woolie! DO IT!!!
[0:36:12] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:36:27] <@Menitta> Nobody likes Stryker in MK tho
[0:36:30] <RyuuAoi> !uptime
[0:36:30] <+MoonlightP> enkidu is so flashy
[0:36:30] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 58 minutes and 3 seconds

[0:36:36] <+MoonlightP> tbh combos in this game always look sick
[0:36:36] <kaine_west> When's Akatsuki? i need some B Tatsu
[0:36:36] <sperium3000> Stryker is super lame
[0:36:38] <DrBeefcastle> @WoolieVersus canonically, Enkidu was a regular human that ran out of humans that would fight him so he let a void bite him to go fight the superhumans
[0:36:40] <%jinking79> Black Geese
[0:36:42] <@Menitta> HES THE COOLEST THO
[0:36:42] <DrBeefcastle> he's the shit
[0:36:45] <thecrabgodrulerofcrabs> i think i read that enkidu is meant to play like a street fighter character? how accurate is that
[0:36:46] <%SkaiVibration> stryker is just a cop
[0:36:48] <%sou1less_> enkidu reminds me of geese a little bit
[0:36:49] <sperium3000> Black Geese sounds sick
[0:36:50] <metroidstar> i turned it up and the sound is a little low. you guys sound fine but the game audio is a little quiet.
[0:36:52] <didgereedoodah> block low my dude
[0:36:53] <%SkaiVibration> look at enkidu lol
[0:36:55] <fireking900> the broken handcuffs are a little edgy tho
[0:36:56] <Vashido22> I like MK9 Stryker
[0:37:04] <@Menitta> Stryker is a cop IN MAGIC DEMON WORLD
[0:37:05] <%binkarus> my thing is fists
[0:37:08] <transporterthesequel> Enkidu in his HABITAT
[0:37:09] <+Cebardo> He has a Geese color
[0:37:11] <+DesertOfSand> Enkidu's gameplan is very counter-hit heavy, but I don't know if I would necessarily say that he's SF-esque
[0:37:12] <@Menitta> AND HE HOLDS UP
[0:37:13] <Smart_ZaK1> Enkidu is basically a Shoto
[0:37:13] <LandOfTheWay> @sou1less_ he straight up has a geese palette
[0:37:16] <Vashido22> @Menitta facts
[0:37:23] <Vashido22> but his old design is so lame man
[0:37:27] <%sou1less_> had no idea he had a geese palette lol
[0:37:28] <ChaotixSpark> @fireking900 Enkidu lore is literally he's a demon and those hand cuffs prevent him from letting it out.
[0:37:35] <@Menitta> Oh yeah, his new design is where its at
[0:37:36] <Vashido22> MK9 though? Good shit Stryker
[0:37:37] <+MyNameIsDVQ> Merk has 2 grabs
[0:37:45] <Finaldragoon> doodFps F
[0:37:51] <ChaotixSpark> His IWEX has Enk destroying his cuffs and exploding his opponent.

[0:40:04] <@Menitta> Eltnum is the coolest
[0:40:04] <GuillotineEm17> Sion
[0:40:05] <+DesertOfSand> Eltnum, with the power of GUN
[0:40:05] <KnightReis> i mean then we see fritz teleporting with a katana
[0:40:06] <+NarcissistCactus> sion
[0:40:08] <kaine_west> Are we ever gonna get any fighting simulators like Fight Night or the UFC games
[0:40:09] <sperium3000> Imperial Japanese soldier
[0:40:09] <+YeezusPieces1> Sion not Ceil
[0:40:11] <FlamingNarwhal> Akatsuki aka Egoraptor
[0:40:11] <+SlowLikeThunder> yeah he's a nazi but he yells chesuto
[0:40:12] <jaedongfan90> ciel? bruh
[0:40:14] <kaine_west> Melty Blood
[0:40:14] <Basch71> glorious nippon spirit
[0:40:16] <+SlowLikeThunder> so who's the real villain
[0:40:17] <PinkSocks> Ciel is a different character.
[0:40:19] <Vashido22> Akatsuki is the sickest
[0:40:19] <+NarcissistCactus> fake fan
[0:40:22] <%Mawari_> It's not Ciel
[0:40:24] <Finaldragoon> someone doesn't drink enough bath water
[0:40:24] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> Was that game written by the author of “Attack on Titan”?
[0:40:24] <ghostravens> any gunslingers or vampire in this game? thinking about picking it up now
[0:40:24] <kenzaki_> Akatsuki Blitzkampf is a dope game
[0:40:28] <haveswordmuststing> doodBait
[0:40:30] <+6695HC> I like Akatsuki's story mode in this game basically just being him wondering who the fuck these people are and where he can get food
[0:40:30] <KantusMonkus> sion eltnam atalasia
[0:40:30] <shadowmaksim> Not Ciel, that's the nun. It's supposed to be Sion. And Eltnum is her middle name or something like that.
[0:40:30] <kenzaki_> Wish more people played it
[0:40:32] <Vashido22> @WoolieVersus Akatsuki is the most fun shoto I've ever played
[0:40:34] <OkNow_64> Japan like to portend it did nothing wrong sometimes
[0:40:34] <thecrabgodrulerofcrabs> also isnt his whole story of how hes here judt japanese captain america
[0:40:35] <Vashido22> PARRIES

[0:40:48] <TangledVirus> CHESTO
[0:40:51] <RyuuAoi> To be fair, Persona 2 Innocent Sin fills you in on ALL the Nazi shite going on in Japan.
[0:40:52] <kaine_west> Akatsuki Blitzkampf has Shinsuke nakamura so it gets a pass from me
[0:40:52] <thecrabgodrulerofcrabs> also its because Eltnam is her middle name
[0:40:56] <+DesertOfSand> @ghostravens Eltnum does cool gun shit, but not really a traditional like western gunslinger archetype
[0:41:07] <ghostravens> @DesertOfSand that's enough for me
[0:41:11] <kaine_west> also some sick Chinese characters
[0:41:19] <+DesertOfSand> Also, Carmine uses hemomancy
[0:41:19] <thecrabgodrulerofcrabs> Sion Eltnam Atlasia
[0:41:27] <+DesertOfSand> Not sure if that's close enough to Vampire for you, but that's also ther
[0:41:31] <%Toynota10> Can someone define Shoto for me?
[0:41:31] <sperium3000> That was FRESH
[0:41:35] <jubejube56> is there a good western gunslinger fighting game character?
[0:41:41] <ghostravens> @DesertOfSand those two are enough. thank you!

[0:42:23] <+Bigfado287> @toynota10 A character with the same oe similar inputs to Ryu from SF
[0:42:25] <RyuuAoi> Diggin' that shirt, Woolie! I missed my shot but I got another design. Looking FRESH.

[0:43:09] <Smart_ZaK1> oof know your place
[0:43:10] <haveswordmuststing> he's the perfect fusion of Ken and Ryu if you squint hard enough
[0:43:13] <thecrabgodrulerofcrabs> god akatsuki is so cool
[0:43:13] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[0:43:15] <didgereedoodah> B tatsu > IW is the only combo you need
[0:43:19] <%Toynota10> Akatsuki seems pretty up there lol
[0:43:21] <@Menitta> Whip is the fucking coolest
[0:43:22] <Mpgame99> Seth, Phonon and Vatista are top tier
[0:43:26] <Vashido22> @Toynota10 Seth, Vatista
[0:43:27] <+DesertOfSand> Top tier is like Phonon, Wagner, Byak, Seth, Vatista
[0:43:28] <kaine_west> KOF 02 <3
[0:43:31] <DrBeefcastle> Akatsuki is actually considered pretty low all things considered
[0:43:31] <Vashido22> Eltnum maybe
[0:43:33] <+DesertOfSand> Not necessarily in that order
[0:43:38] <+DesertOfSand> Eltnum is very up there, too, yeah
[0:43:39] <fireking900> dose woolie pronounce his name A Cat Sue Key
[0:43:39] <thecrabgodrulerofcrabs> i swear i have no idea who i wanna learn if i get this game
[0:43:40] <DrBeefcastle> the tier list is just so tight that it doesn't really matter
[0:43:41] <Vashido22> WHIP Kreygasm
[0:43:42] <jubejube56> isn't merkava and reaper up there too
[0:43:45] <@Menitta> Oh THATS her deal
[0:43:47] <@Menitta> Huh
[0:43:54] <+DesertOfSand> Merk and Gordeau are good, but not like top tier afaik
[0:43:56] <DrBeefcastle> Merkava and Gordeau are solid mid-high tier
[0:44:01] <Mpgame99> ^
[0:44:01] <foxhounder29> where is ja?
[0:44:02] <%Toynota10> I remember Seth had this move where he pulled up his mask and black aura surrounded him. What does that do?
[0:44:02] <GuillotineEm17> Seth Phonon Vatista are generally considered the best but tiers are super close so it doesn't really matter
[0:44:03] <DrBeefcastle> not the best, but rock solid
[0:44:09] <RyuuAoi> That's terrible
[0:44:14] <+DesertOfSand> I think in UNIEL Gordeau was top tier, but I could be wrong
[0:44:15] <%GunterDriger6> Video game logic!
[0:44:21] <DrBeefcastle> Gordeau was extremely good in UNIEL yeah
[0:44:31] <+Dragon4234> @toynota10 buffs his projectile.
[0:44:32] <thecrabgodrulerofcrabs> i like carmine, i like seth, i like hyde, i like akatsuki, i like byakuya, and to top it all off, i suck at fighting games
[0:44:39] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> When she finds out, does she scream “All is untrue! All is untrue!”?
[0:44:39] <%Toynota10> ohhhhh cool
[0:44:43] <Bloogoose> What a mixup
[0:44:45] <kaine_west> the mixup
[0:44:47] <ghostravens> @thecrabgodrulerofcrabs same
[0:44:49] <Gonewiththevoid> gordeau was super good in UNIEL, inspired all the GRIM REAPAH memes
[0:44:50] <+DesertOfSand> Yo when you CS and see that Green Shield it's like mmm delicioso
[0:44:51] <%Toynota10> I just got the game myself, so I'm learning a lil bit
[0:44:52] <%jinking79> Akatsuki only character in the game that can pull off a Evo moment 37

[0:45:00] <RyuuAoi> "My name is Fork. I use Fork"
[0:45:04] <+DesertOfSand> Yeah, ask away fam
[0:45:07] <+theunforgivingsquid> I am digging merkava's moves
[0:45:21] <shryoc> this game is very fun
[0:45:23] <ghostravens> how's this game on pc?
[0:45:27] <+DesertOfSand> Game on PC is great
[0:45:27] <thecrabgodrulerofcrabs> id say id definitely go for seth for top chuuni, but that health man
[0:45:32] <Vashido22> @Toynota10 thats his BC, it makes it so they can't hit his orb, only going away when seth gets hit
[0:45:35] <+DesertOfSand> Seth is so goddamn chuuni
[0:45:40] <jubejube56> Merkava just seems like Twelve if it was a proper character
[0:45:43] <KantusMonkus> seth is one of the hardest to learn
[0:45:45] <SquiglyBattleOpera> Shout outs to Woolie for his top tier taste in fighting game characters
[0:45:49] <SquiglyBattleOpera> Merkava's the best ever
[0:45:52] <%linkwolf4> what health? woolieSMUG
[0:45:55] <+DesertOfSand> Seth makes me more embarassed to have someone watch over my shoulder than even the skimpiest of anime titties
[0:46:05] <Vashido22> Seth makes my hands hurt
[0:46:09] <RyuuAoi> "My name is Shive..." Okay dats kinda kool doe
[0:46:11] <GuillotineEm17> Seth and Yuzu are ridiculous in terms of inputs
[0:46:12] <Bloogoose> WOW

[0:46:21] <KantusMonkus> deadass get carpel tunnel from playing seth but got used to yuzu
[0:46:23] <kaine_west> yeyeyeye
[0:46:30] <niishucks> j.2c divekick
[0:46:40] <$FuqBoiSlim> pknKEK
[0:46:45] <niishucks> use the dice kick
[0:46:45] <kaine_west> Yuzu combos are nigh impossible
[0:46:50] <thecrabgodrulerofcrabs> then hes prob not for me, inputs are the hardest part for me cuz my hand-eye is
[0:46:53] <%TeethMuncher> Why block when you could assault?
[0:46:53] <thecrabgodrulerofcrabs> not great
[0:47:02] <hoebag699> his eyes on the victory screen are hilarious
[0:47:10] <Vashido22> Seth j.22 into crossup, jump cancel air 6C
[0:47:11] <ghostravens> how are eltnum's inputs? also, how's this game on pc?
[0:47:11] <kaine_west> Linne and Hyde for easy execution
[0:47:11] <jubejube56> Why would I block when there are buttons on the controller?
[0:47:12] <Vashido22> like, wtf
[0:47:17] <+DesertOfSand> Wakeup B Tatsu is the real online shit
[0:47:19] <RyuuAoi> This game goes DEEP
[0:47:21] <Vashido22> my brain can't handle that
[0:47:22] <GuillotineEm17> Seth Yuzu and Vatista probably have the hardest inputs
[0:47:25] <KantusMonkus> pc port is p good
[0:47:27] <Mpgame99> The game is fine on PC
[0:47:34] <DrBeefcastle> Hilda is pretty hard as well
[0:47:36] <Vashido22> UNIST pc options are bare bones
[0:47:37] <Mpgame99> Probably a little harder to find matches though
[0:47:46] <thecrabgodrulerofcrabs> i played hyde in bbtag when i played it and performed fairly decently so ill prob start with him
[0:47:49] <+theunforgivingsquid> how is Carmine?
[0:47:50] <RyuuAoi> @kantusmonkus PS VITA?
[0:47:54] <Psychoduckk> Did they explain how the GRD system works?
[0:47:58] <%Toynota10> what even is merkava
[0:48:01] <KantusMonkus> i never played the vita version
[0:48:06] <+DesertOfSand> Carmine isn't bad, but if you can't open people up you just end up killing yourself
[0:48:06] <GuillotineEm17> Discord community for UNIST is basically where you want to find matches
[0:48:07] <DrBeefcastle> fair warning, the characters are much different in bbtag than in the original
[0:48:07] <+ALTRNico> DP C is the invul
[0:48:09] <+DesertOfSand> Since he uses his health to do stuff
[0:48:09] <+javonero15> hyde is not the same like in bbtag
[0:48:10] <ghostravens> @Toynota10 a stand arrow, apparently
[0:48:11] <Mpgame99> Carmine’s pretty ok
[0:48:13] <DrBeefcastle> some people don't even play the same main between games
[0:48:14] <SuavisLies> Its hard to not perform well with bbtag Hyde
[0:48:18] <Vashido22> oh right, a tatsu -2
[0:48:22] <RyuuAoi> @kantusmonkus It probably doesn't exist. Ha
[0:48:26] <niishucks> merkava is a failed rebirth that became a void
[0:48:28] <KantusMonkus> lmao
[0:48:29] <Vashido22> LUL
[0:48:32] <%sou1less_> yeah hyde bbtag is way different
[0:48:32] <SixthSun2> Counter open up LUL
[0:48:37] <KamenTyphoon> ＢＴＡＴＳＵ
[0:48:40] <FriskyJesta> damn he chestod him hard
[0:48:44] <+theunforgivingsquid> @desertofsand thanks for the info
[0:48:45] <$FuqBoiSlim> rip
[0:48:46] <%Nomad_Scholar> Howdy
[0:48:49] <jubejube56> @niishucks based off that sentence I imagine the lore behind this game is easy to understand
[0:48:52] <thecrabgodrulerofcrabs> yeah i realize the control differences but i feel like i got a good understanding of how his kit works
[0:49:07] <KantusMonkus> uni lore is wild
[0:49:08] <CrackerJack450> PLAY MIKA
[0:49:15] <DrBeefcastle> the lore of this game is incredible and just about the dumbest shit I've ever read besides Blazblue
[0:49:16] <+javonero15> orbiter
[0:49:16] <Vashido22> PLAY MIKA XD
[0:49:16] <shadowmaksim> @jubejube56 It's actually a lot simplier than you'd think.
[0:49:19] <CrackerJack450> PogChamp PogChamp
[0:49:28] <%jinking79> Grab aren't Free in here
[0:49:29] <KantusMonkus> everyone asks if you're XD but never if your're DX
[0:49:32] <Vashido22> unist lore is pretty basic
[0:49:33] <RyuuAoi> Best two outta three. Jaysis, @woolieversus
[0:49:34] <jubejube56> @thecrabgodrulerofcrabs from what I understood, every bbtag rep is dumbed down greatly from their game counterpart
[0:49:37] <+Cebardo> Wanna fucking aneurysm? Read Blazblue lore
[0:49:43] <JinjaBredMan> When's Nanase tho?
[0:49:44] <Vashido22> Blazblue lore LUL
[0:49:47] <KnightReis> play carmine if you're the type of player who gets to 1 hp and thinks "now i can do everything"
[0:49:49] <Vashido22> I enjoy GG lore
[0:49:50] <%sou1less_> but he's my main in both so definately can do it t
[0:49:52] <Vashido22> BB? Fuck that
[0:49:58] <thecrabgodrulerofcrabs> yeah, everybody has almost the same inputs for everything
[0:50:04] <KantusMonkus> ThE CoNtInUm ShIFt
[0:50:06] <DrBeefcastle> I spent hours reading Blazblue "lore" and I had several out of body experiences
[0:50:11] <thecrabgodrulerofcrabs> so thatll be a roadblock to unlearn
[0:50:14] <DrBeefcastle> it's so good
[0:50:14] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:50:15] <+DesertOfSand> @KnightReis Can't lose health when you're at 1 HP
[0:50:16] <didgereedoodah> BB lore is convoluted but at least there's no BACKYARD
[0:50:16] <jubejube56> Isn't this game somehow connected to all that type/moon stuff?
[0:50:16] <+javonero15> Hyde has good rekkas
[0:50:19] <Vashido22> @DrBeefcastle sounds about right
[0:50:21] <+DesertOfSand> It's the smartest of plays

[0:50:24] <%Wool> If you play BBTag, don't play your mains from the other fighters
[0:50:27] <hoebag699> doesn't bb have that guy who turned into a girl with big tiddies
[0:50:29] <Vashido22> @jubejube56 no, that's melty blood
[0:50:30] <gordieda20> I enjoyed BB lore for what it is LUL
[0:50:32] <+jorgamund> I used to know all the BlazBlue lore. then they released a second game.
[0:50:33] <Vashido22> same developer
[0:50:35] <KantusMonkus> yeah Mai
[0:50:42] <+Cebardo> Yo if Reggie makes this comback...
[0:50:43] <Smart_ZaK1> here comes the comeback
[0:50:44] <Gonewiththevoid> bb lore is hilarious. its opaque as hell but theres fun bits in there
[0:50:44] <shadowmaksim> The problem with "BB" lore is that they throw way too many terms at you. Some involving some wild concepts. If you haven't been following the game from the beginning, it's hard to follow.
[0:50:45] <gatorafan> I only know GG lore and I know it's pretty dumb.
[0:50:47] <Smart_ZaK1> AWW
[0:50:50] <Vashido22> LUL
[0:50:53] <MrCJBubba> I like the big goofy weirdo he is like a weird mix of Painwheel and Dhalsim
[0:51:03] <Vashido22> GG lore is dumb, but its fun and not hard to understand
[0:51:09] <Vashido22> BB lore is messier than KH
[0:51:10] <thecrabgodrulerofcrabs> GG lore is dumb but its easy to understand dumb
[0:51:12] <+theunforgivingsquid> I love BB one favorite band the lire is convoluted and wonderful
[0:51:15] <DrBeefcastle> yeah GG doesn't take itself seriously at all like the others
[0:51:15] <BearSawed> here we go its the noodle man
[0:51:18] <hoebag699> @kantusmonkus that's the extent of my bb lore knowledge
[0:51:20] <Gonewiththevoid> also what didnt help bb lore is that they changed translation companies after the second game and the new one used not only different terms
[0:51:21] <+jorgamund> BB lore is like a bored writer read GG lore and said "hold my beer"
[0:51:32] <+Cebardo> Did anyone mention Reverse Beat to make yourself safe and possibly continue pressure?
[0:51:40] <Gonewiththevoid> but also had lower quality checking
[0:51:48] <shryoc> cell phone ninja executive PogChamp
[0:51:49] <+DesertOfSand> I mean, I don't think they're reading the chat for tips
[0:51:49] <UnbreakableDoof> YO
[0:51:52] <+ALTRNico> YO
[0:51:53] <niishucks> whiff cancel 5c into 5a

[0:52:04] <Vashido22> REEEEEEEE
[0:52:09] <+javonero15> If only you can play Yuzu from bbtag in Uni
[0:52:12] <thecrabgodrulerofcrabs> GG is just "how do we get as many rock references and insanely powerful characters as possible?"
[0:52:13] <KantusMonkus> tfw bullet is just a jobber in the story
[0:52:17] <%n33t_1337> n33t_1337 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[0:52:19] <Laironx3> That's a Kermit move
[0:52:23] <UnbreakableDoof> Did they do online sets yet?
[0:52:24] <BearSawed> All i know about BB is that it doesnt matter where you are on screen you can and probably will be hit
[0:52:25] <+DesertOfSand> Yeah, crossup protection in UNIST is pretty aggressive
[0:52:27] <shadowmaksim> @theunforgivingsquid It does. I went straight from "CT" to "CF" so I had to take some time looking up phrases and events. It really helped.
[0:52:28] <+theunforgivingsquid> ragna is the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[0:52:29] <Vashido22> @thecrabgodrulerofcrabs Yep, and thats why its fun dumb
[0:52:38] <gatorafan> How big did you guys said Sol's number is?
[0:52:39] <jubejube56> @thecrabgodrulerofcrabs occasionally they play sad music for a valentine and mention "feelings"
[0:52:48] <ghostravens> @gatorafan it's very big
[0:52:53] <RyuuAoi> Chat who was here from the get go, did Woolie pick the boss character out the gates?
[0:53:00] <kaine_west> nah
[0:53:02] <Twoiis> nope
[0:53:05] <KantusMonkus> mark isnt a boss character
[0:53:09] <Vashido22> I do feel bad for Sol sometimes, gotta suck to have the love of your life...you know @jubejube56
[0:53:10] <niishucks> merkava the cutest
[0:53:11] <KantusMonkus> only boss character is hilda
[0:53:11] <kaine_west> Merkava's just one of many weirdo picks
[0:53:17] <RyuuAoi> He's evolving
[0:53:17] <+ALTRNico> he should be just from the design tho
[0:53:29] <thecrabgodrulerofcrabs> Ky could probably level a city with no effort, and so could like half of the cast probably, but no one does
[0:53:42] <nlombardo> just getting into this game, is Enkidu good?
[0:53:42] <UnbreakableDoof> Merkava is the best pick 200% of the time, he is the goddamn coolest
[0:53:46] <FatDragonQuest> kind of a wierd issue I have with fighting games is that getting a big combo down is personally overwhelming, so I usually just go for short bnbs or grapplers
[0:53:54] <KantusMonkus> enkidu is bottom 2 but he's still viable
[0:53:55] <Mpgame99> Enkidu is considered the worst character by most people
[0:54:00] <Vashido22> @nlombardo he's the worst, but still good. I know it sounds weird, but its the balance of the game
[0:54:00] <+Wyrmidon> not really @nlombardo, he's low tier, but he's not unplayable
[0:54:01] <jubejube56> @Vashido22 and then have some British tosser bug you about it in fight dialogue
[0:54:04] <Mpgame99> But this game is really well balanced
[0:54:08] <Mpgame99> So it’s fine
[0:54:09] <KnightReis> just think though if you reach the final boss of a new game and its just an inflatable arm tube man
[0:54:10] <Vashido22> @jubejube56 lmaooo true
[0:54:11] <nlombardo> thanks guys
[0:54:15] <Vashido22> fucking axel
[0:54:19] <+ALTRNico> this game has like Tekken 7 tier list where everyone is viable regardless of their position
[0:54:19] <+javonero15> No one practices for the enkidu matchup
[0:54:29] <%Toynota10> Shiiiiiiiiiit Reggie's really good!
[0:54:34] <Twoiis> after 66c I usually just 236 ic C as phonon.
[0:54:39] <Smart_ZaK1> Just hold the L
[0:54:39] <+theunforgivingsquid> @knightreis lol
[0:54:41] <gatorafan> Merkava looks like someone grabbed Blanka and stretched it. moon2E
[0:54:43] <RyuuAoi> RECKT
[0:54:48] <+TruSpindash> SMOL
[0:54:50] <%TeethMuncher> What hitbox LUL
[0:54:52] <%sou1less_> there are still enkidu in tourneys sometimes though
[0:54:54] <Twoiis> I mean b.
[0:54:57] <beatie_g> 14 btw
[0:55:02] <KantusMonkus> enkidu actually won a couple toruneys
[0:55:08] <+DesertOfSand> Yeah, Enkidu and Mika still get a lot of representation despite being bottom 2, because they're still good
[0:55:11] <+Shotgundam009> Merkava is Twelve's cousin
[0:55:14] <+DesertOfSand> Very compressed tiers in UNIST
[0:55:18] <+Wyrmidon> Wald's throw hurtbox messes me up too often
[0:55:20] <+Cebardo> Considering how many times I hit people with full charge 5C, yea nobody practices the Enk matchub
[0:55:23] <%Wool> is Woolie gonna do the entire tutorial

[0:58:08] <RyuuAoi> @jorgamund Ha GUILTYYYYYYY
[0:58:11] <%XzileGaming> XzileGaming converted from a Twitch Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub! 
[0:58:24] <+ALTRNico> barr
[0:58:35] <KantusMonkus> get big vorpal
[0:58:38] <+theunforgivingsquid> @jorgamund I like ur name I also like smasy
[0:58:39] <KantusMonkus> for big bois
[0:58:42] <RyuuAoi> @jorgamund U DA BEST
[0:58:54] <+DesertOfSand> And each character gets their own unique Vorpal Trait while in Vorpal. Unless you're Mika because XD
[0:58:58] <Smart_ZaK1> This game has systems in its systems
[0:59:04] <haveswordmuststing> basically every 14 seconds
[0:59:04] <KantusMonkus> mika's vorpal is XD
[0:59:09] <+DesertOfSand> 16.5 seconds, iirc
[0:59:09] <+jorgamund> thx
[0:59:11] <UnbreakableDoof> Roman Cancels BABY
[0:59:20] <skewerstar> How do you get GRD bar tho?
[0:59:30] <thecrabgodrulerofcrabs> by being aggressive
[0:59:33] <+javonero15> YRC
[0:59:37] <KantusMonkus> or holding D
[0:59:38] <+DesertOfSand> GRD goes up for moving forward, teching throws, landing throws, and shielding
[0:59:41] <+DesertOfSand> And concentration
[0:59:41] <UnbreakableDoof> WHAT
[0:59:41] <alrobot2014> is it actually just a roman cancel, because that's a lot less intimidating than i thought then
[0:59:44] <+DesertOfSand> I'm sure they'll go over shielding
[0:59:45] <haveswordmuststing> be aggressive, be be aggressive
[0:59:47] <UnbreakableDoof> I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THIS
[0:59:48] <jubejube56> but vorpal cancel sounds better
[0:59:54] <UnbreakableDoof> THAT YOU COULD DO IT ON THAT MOVE
[0:59:59] <+DesertOfSand> But basically either by being aggressive or by defending well, you build GRD
[1:00:03] <+DeathGodSkeith> chain shift gives meter
[1:00:05] <RyuuAoi> FIGHT
[1:00:05] <DrBeefcastle> yeah chain shift is basically just a roman cancel with meter building
[1:00:09] <+MusouMiko> it's literally just a yrc based on if you have advantage or not
[1:00:14] <thecrabgodrulerofcrabs> you get it by being aggressive, you lose it by being *too* defensive
[1:00:21] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @ChaotixSpark
[1:00:28] <PinkSocks> It's 20 per block
[1:00:29] <RyuuAoi> Whoop his ass! Whoop his ass!
[1:00:35] <KantusMonkus> just dont get hit while shielding or else you get grd broke
[1:00:37] <KantusMonkus> and that hurts
[1:00:38] <%nlombardo> nlombardo subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:00:40] <ChaotixSpark> Huh odd.
[1:00:42] <UnbreakableDoof> At the same time, defense can get you grid via shielding
[1:00:47] <UnbreakableDoof> a lot
[1:00:55] <UnbreakableDoof> blocking normally builds it fast too
[1:00:55] <ChaotixSpark> Id figure clip sharing is a normal twitch thing.
[1:00:58] <+DesertOfSand> Yeah, that's why I said good defense builds GRD
[1:01:11] <+ALTRNico> basically, if you play good, you get grd gauge
[1:01:12] <+DesertOfSand> Teching backwards also loses your GRD
[1:01:18] <UnbreakableDoof> play game good, get rewarded
[1:01:25] <SixthSun2> Backing down gives you a penalty, as it should
[1:01:26] <gatorafan> What do you mean I get punished for being a coward? Kappa
[1:01:39] <KnightReis> fills up over time
[1:01:47] <+Wyrmidon> It fills up over time
[1:01:49] <+DesertOfSand> You gotta wait for the bar to fill
[1:01:55] <ghostravens> is there a way to play this game without having to pay attention to the grid? not that i don't care, i just find it a little overwhelming
[1:01:57] <+Cebardo> Nah its realtime
[1:02:02] <@Moobot> Easy with the emojis @RyuuAoi
[1:02:10] <jubejube56> @ghostravens you could always just ignore it
[1:02:13] <+DesertOfSand> GRD is pretty key. If you ignore it you're gonna be at a major disadvantage
[1:02:23] <RyuuAoi> @moobot SHUT. UP.
[1:02:28] <+javonero15> grd is key part
[1:02:28] <+Cebardo> I mean you'll always be at a disadvantage
[1:02:29] <Mpgame99> You could ignore it but you’ll lose a lot
[1:02:34] <KantusMonkus> moobot shooting for no reason
[1:02:49] <jubejube56> It'd be like ignoring meter in Street Fighter
[1:02:50] <+javonero15> at that point its playing vanilla sf
[1:02:56] <+DesertOfSand> Worth noting if you Shield in neutral, you can't change your stand/crouch, so if you standing Shield you CANNOT block low
[1:03:01] <RyuuAoi> @kantusmonkus FOR REAL. Dats racist
[1:03:03] <+DesertOfSand> While if you Green Shield, you are able to change high/low block as desired
[1:03:07] <+Cebardo> Just think of it as primarily a cancel and a damage/charater buff
[1:03:14] <+theunforgivingsquid> who has the closet play style to Yuki terumi?
[1:03:58] <+redyoshi5> does vorpal go away if you dont use it?
[1:04:05] <+DesertOfSand> Vorpal is on a timer, yes
[1:04:10] <+javonero15> Controlling neutral
[1:04:23] <Mpgame99> If the cycle ends and you don’t have the most GRD you lose it
[1:04:24] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:04:31] <+redyoshi5> @DesertOfSand cool thanks
[1:04:51] <UnbreakableDoof> @ghostravens early on and at low level, you super can ignore it
[1:05:02] <UnbreakableDoof> because you will get it naturally
[1:05:09] <KnightReis> yeah just learn it as you go slowly
[1:05:14] <UnbreakableDoof> and you can use the tools when you just happen to have it
[1:05:33] <UnbreakableDoof> building it and keeping it is where it gets complicated
[1:05:51] <giveupwithavengeance> just be aware of it in the beginning
[1:06:04] <KantusMonkus> yuzu's only reversal is vo sadcowboy
[1:06:06] <UnbreakableDoof> just keep in mind you can press DD to get free meter and cancel out of anything if you're glowing
[1:06:13] <EnderGamma> you can VO in combos though. not just neutral
[1:06:16] <didgereedoodah> Gordeau can grab it tho
[1:06:22] <jaedongfan90> thats cvo
[1:06:26] <townzzzzz> FF
[1:06:28] <GuillotineEm17> Force Function?
[1:06:29] <+ALTRNico> BC is unique
[1:06:30] <UnbreakableDoof> everything else will come with experimentation
[1:06:35] <ChaotixSpark> there's specific combos that allow you to VO as a combo ender.
[1:06:35] <%Wool> Force Function
[1:06:35] <shadowmaksim> Being able to use supers despite not having the meter for it is a fun mechanic. "Fate/Unlimited Codes" and "Melty Blood" also have it and it led to some silly stuff.
[1:06:38] <+Wyrmidon> his worms don't disappear on block in vorpal
[1:06:44] <+DesertOfSand> Not everyone. *cries in Mika*
[1:06:47] <+Wyrmidon> ^
[1:06:49] <+ALTRNico> XD

[1:06:59] <MTLxSpider> mika doesnt vorpal. rip
[1:07:15] <lordreginald> @WoolieVersus merkava's is that his worms don't disappear on block
[1:07:16] <+Wyrmidon> DX
[1:07:17] <pyookoomookoo> XD
[1:07:27] <%sou1less_> love hydes chip dmg
[1:07:28] <FatDragonQuest> they forgot
[1:07:30] <+NarcissistCactus> cirAYAYA
[1:07:38] <KantusMonkus> they ask you if you're XD but not if you're DX
[1:07:41] <+ALTRNico> down down
[1:07:43] <ChaotixSpark> Yeah, merks is good.
[1:08:08] <UnbreakableDoof> @WoolieVersus Merk vorpal also makes his B+C (shake the baby) special cancelable
[1:08:08] <+DesertOfSand> Eltnum even has a couple of Vorpal Traits. The only explanation is that she stole Mika's
[1:08:41] <UnbreakableDoof> not exactly optimal, but can be useful sometimes
[1:08:55] <gatorafan> Loving those animations for (what I think they are) the high level supers, cinematic yet they don't take any time away from the match.
[1:09:00] <%GunterDriger6> @woolieversus you also can't chain shift when you do EX moves
[1:09:00] <Lvl100_Charizard> 4B
[1:09:04] <+theunforgivingsquid> any one in this game play similar play style to Yuki terumi in BB?
[1:09:09] <reiju_22> cirAYAYA
[1:09:18] <+AllenDeadman> Phonon Kreygasm
[1:09:28] <niishucks> @WoolieVersus talk about b+c Force function
[1:09:30] <KantusMonkus> infinite worth ex is lit
[1:09:38] <DrBeefcastle> Phonon's buttons are SO fucked
[1:09:41] <DrBeefcastle> and I play Gordeau
[1:09:41] <KantusMonkus> also idk how yuki plays
[1:09:46] <ChaotixSpark> 4B can still be challenged though.
[1:09:50] <Nevicate> phonon 3c is wacky
[1:09:50] <+Mercer618> @theunforgivingsquid not particularly. No one steals meter to my knowledge, but Gordeau can steal GRD
[1:09:52] <micmic112> phonon is fair and balanced, she has no mixup
[1:09:52] <Mpgame99> Terumi is kinda weird
[1:09:52] <giveupwithavengeance> edgelords have to play seth
[1:09:56] <pyookoomookoo> Phonon for BBTAG
[1:09:57] <KantusMonkus> phonon 3C
[1:09:58] <micmic112> if you get hit it's entirely your fault.
[1:10:01] <Mpgame99> I don’t think anyone is that similar to him
[1:10:02] <+javonero15> Force Function hasn't been mentioned
[1:10:06] <Lvl100_Charizard> 3C LUL
[1:10:11] <haveswordmuststing> @pyookoomookoo no
[1:10:12] <+DesertOfSand> Instant assault A is the only mixup you need
[1:10:13] <ChaotixSpark> pho 3C is too risky since you cant reverse beat out of it.
[1:10:13] <MTLxSpider> force function uses Grd meter
[1:10:17] <MTLxSpider> b+C
[1:10:18] <sphereshots12> Don't shake the baby
[1:10:20] <ChaotixSpark> If you whiff it, youre so vulnerable as pho.
[1:10:25] <KnightReis> if you want knifeman its seth, if you want to steal things its gordeau but otherwise they're different
[1:10:25] <+theunforgivingsquid> @mercer618 thanks
[1:10:28] <+javonero15> B+C
[1:10:44] <Gonewiththevoid> if you want his general vibe carmine's the resident laughing psycho
[1:10:54] <jubejube56> from the little I can see, it appears Phonon just confirms off everything
[1:10:55] <DarkVinceX> how's it going everyone
[1:11:00] <Mpgame99> She does
[1:11:12] <%binkarus> I'm going to rewatch this VOD later when I want some gitgud juice
[1:11:13] <micmic112> the hardest confirm she has is from 623A/B
[1:11:13] <ChaotixSpark> @jubejube56 But i mean, that's everyone though.
[1:11:14] <KantusMonkus> yuzu ELBOW
[1:11:14] <+Wyrmidon> a lot of increases become overheads
[1:11:15] <%binkarus> I like this game
[1:11:25] <micmic112> also yeah that's everyone
[1:11:25] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:11:33] <haveswordmuststing> Phonon is almost full unga rushdown at halfscreen
[1:11:45] <micmic112> just block lol
[1:11:47] <jubejube56> Well guess I just haven't seen everyone yet then
[1:11:48] <+ALTRNico> B+C is hit grab
[1:12:17] <UnbreakableDoof> @WoolieVersus Merkava's dash C and 3C can convert into his flight (just tap up) or a fireball on block or hit
[1:12:34] <UnbreakableDoof> Also holding C for 3C is a fakeout
[1:12:57] <MTLxSpider> oh sht i never noticed
[1:12:59] <Giothegame> Hell yeah Under-Night
[1:13:00] <MTLxSpider> ouf
[1:13:09] <jubejube56> its like the opposite of Rising Thunder
[1:13:11] <+DesertOfSand> DPing after somebody techs your throw is the real big brain shit
[1:13:14] <Shiranui24> +7?
[1:13:14] <MTLxSpider> this is the opposite of SF5
[1:13:16] <KantusMonkus> i like how mark can just extend his grab
[1:13:18] <micmic112> phonon's 3C is super slow, you can probably punish it on reaction if you jump forward Assault after
[1:13:24] <MTLxSpider> dont take the throw
[1:13:26] <Shiranui24> that's so much
[1:13:32] <+DesertOfSand> Oh they should probably show off Gold Techs
[1:13:34] <micmic112> i mean, if you jump forward assault on reaction*
[1:13:56] <KantusMonkus> waldstien's gold skin hides the gold throw
[1:14:32] <+DesertOfSand> 3C throw tech OS is one of the most useful OSs in the game
[1:14:34] <+AllenDeadman> oh there is a shorthop commnd
[1:14:36] <+DesertOfSand> That shit is great
[1:14:47] <Shiranui24> @WoolieVersus you can throw while you have your opponent in blockstun but they have more time to tech
[1:14:50] <UnbreakableDoof> it is also an airdash input
[1:14:50] <ChaotixSpark> @WoolieVersus Ask Icekin about RTM and option select. Also assault affects scaling.
[1:14:57] <MTLxSpider> air hop*
[1:15:03] <+Wyrmidon> grounded assault makes your air normal prorate more than the regular jump normal
[1:15:16] <+Wyrmidon> at least for hitstun
[1:15:23] <UnbreakableDoof> if you ever played Guilty Gear or any anime fighter that needs Instant Air Dashes in combos, this game makes that easier
[1:15:24] <pow2009> not a short hop, its assault. it will jump at your foe but you cant block @AllenDeadman . Using it grants 1 GRD but increases your landing lag even if you dont press a button
[1:15:37] <+AllenDeadman> oh I see
[1:15:40] <+theunforgivingsquid> I love merkava's flowing hair
[1:15:56] <ChaotixSpark> whiffing assault button leaves you at -1 i think where just jumping leaves you at 0
[1:16:09] <pow2009> Merkava's throw does more damage if you spin your sitck and mash
[1:16:10] <+ALTRNico> 4B 5BB 5C 6C 236B
[1:16:19] <UnbreakableDoof> I got merk combos
[1:16:25] <UnbreakableDoof> If you want em
[1:16:48] <@Solidus_113> post if you got 'em
[1:17:11] <Finaldragoon> are they going to go over the entire roster?
[1:17:14] <+DesertOfSand> Does Woolie not know about Invalid combos?
[1:17:22] <UnbreakableDoof> if you do 2CC and jump into C, B, you can actually land and use the dash attack
[1:17:33] <jubejube56> @DesertOfSand is that like black beat from GG?
[1:17:35] <EnderGamma> CVO
[1:17:39] <UnbreakableDoof> because merk rising in his dash C and 3C is a hitbox
[1:17:45] <EnderGamma> FF
[1:17:45] <MTLxSpider> @WoolieVersus force function!
[1:17:46] <+ALTRNico> that's not a grab
[1:17:46] <pow2009> Red combos are invalid, like a black beat in GG it means they can tech out. And its hold to tech in this game
[1:17:51] <+Wyrmidon> I don't think you went over rebeats @WoolieVersus
[1:17:54] <+DesertOfSand> @jubejube56 It's just getting hit when you could've teched out. Makes the combo count Red
[1:17:56] <EnderGamma> we haven't covered force function
[1:17:58] <+BSplitz> did they go over whiff canceling with 5A?
[1:18:00] <UnbreakableDoof> it comes out frame 7, so it is a good anti-air
[1:18:01] <RyuuAoi> Together, we stand together
[1:18:06] <KantusMonkus> did they go over cvo?
[1:18:17] <UnbreakableDoof> yeyeye
[1:18:22] <UnbreakableDoof> 22C is godlike
[1:18:24] <+DesertOfSand> They did not go over wA stuff
[1:18:36] <%Toynota10> Can you die on chip in this?
[1:18:36] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:18:48] <UnbreakableDoof> you pretty much always want to end with 236B into 22C
[1:18:50] <ZippyPsycho> @Toynota10 No
[1:18:50] <GuillotineEm17> No
[1:18:51] <KantusMonkus> cant get chipped out but there is chip
[1:18:58] <UnbreakableDoof> if you have the meter for it
[1:19:06] <+BSplitz> they should discuss whiff canceling
[1:19:10] <UnbreakableDoof> yeyeyeyeyeye
[1:19:20] <Mpgame99> Reverse beat is something they should talk about
[1:19:27] <anovertmoose> someone tell Woolie that you spin stick and mash buttons to get max hits off throw
[1:19:31] <+DesertOfSand> Yeah, reverse beat into whiff A is pretty important stuff
[1:19:38] <+ALTRNico> make unsafe normals safe
[1:19:45] <ghostravens> jesus how many systems does this game have?
[1:19:53] <KantusMonkus> big systems
[1:19:59] <jubejube56> @ghostravens enough to intimidate
[1:20:00] <+DesertOfSand> Mika IC5CwA is the goddamn good shit right there
[1:20:03] <+DesertOfSand> +7 on block
[1:20:07] <niishucks> @WoolieVersus reverse beat whiff cancel like 5c 5a
[1:20:10] <MTLxSpider> back back only in bbtag
[1:20:13] <UnbreakableDoof> @ghostravens a lot, but it has a VERY complete tutorial for you to chip away at at your own pace
[1:20:20] <ghostravens> @jubejube56 i mean yeah, i'm intimidated
[1:20:24] <BearSawed> How many systems? anwser, YES
[1:20:26] <giveupwithavengeance> this game runs on the infinite systems everywhere engine
[1:20:26] <UnbreakableDoof> It has explanations for fucking everything
[1:20:30] <ghostravens> @UnbreakableDoof fair
[1:20:34] <+SlowLikeThunder> @WoolieVersus don't forget every character has a move on B+C
[1:20:38] <anovertmoose> @WoolieVersus you can spin the stick while mashing buttons to get up to 8 hits off merkava's throw
[1:20:43] <+DesertOfSand> Tutorial in UNIST is fucking incredible
[1:20:44] <KantusMonkus> this game's tutorial is godlike
[1:20:54] <+AllenDeadman> Phonon is just Kreygasm
[1:21:01] <UnbreakableDoof> UNIST tutorial is SSS tier
[1:21:02] <+ALTRNico> you'll spend like 2 hours on tutorial alone
[1:21:04] <+DesertOfSand> But don't do the option where it just goes through all of them. Go through each difficulty incrementally
[1:21:14] <UnbreakableDoof> yes
[1:21:17] <kaine_west> I love the UNIST tutorials, beats every other tutorial for other FGs i play
[1:21:18] <UnbreakableDoof> absolutely
[1:21:21] <UnbreakableDoof> pace yourself
[1:21:26] <UnbreakableDoof> it's too much at once
[1:21:26] <MTLxSpider> nbo
[1:21:33] <GuillotineEm17> This game's tutorial literally teaches you option selects
[1:21:43] <%sou1less_> this and gg have great tutorials
[1:21:49] <jubejube56> I'd still say Skullgirls tutorial was the best, I wouldn't understand any fighting games without it
[1:22:03] <kaine_west> Tekken Tutorials... what tutorials
[1:22:03] <Mpgame99> This is better than skullgirls
[1:22:05] <+DesertOfSand> Well it's more like it's ordered by category, not difficulty, so the difficulty curve can be too much for new people
[1:22:20] <ghostravens> @kaine_west guess google or die?
[1:22:20] <Mpgame99> This is the best FG tutorial by far
[1:22:27] <+Wyrmidon> @jubejube56 skullgirls was the best at the time and set the standard, but Unist tutorial is better at this point.
[1:22:28] <RyuuAoi> TNF
[1:22:30] <+ALTRNico> @WoolieVersus Merkava EX DP is invul
[1:22:38] <kaine_west> watch Koreans and or streamers to learn that springkick is a thing
[1:22:52] <UnbreakableDoof> You almost never want to EX DP with merkava though
[1:23:05] <RyuuAoi> "Tuesday Night Fistings"
[1:23:08] <+Mercer618> Doesn't Phonon have a 22 input move?
[1:23:09] <jubejube56> I wouldn't be surprised, this game probably has a bunch more ground to cover too
[1:23:10] <UnbreakableDoof> because 236C is just as invuln, and you can convert
[1:23:34] <didgereedoodah> Phonon has a 22X move
[1:23:47] <micmic112> she doesn't
[1:23:52] <UnbreakableDoof> just 236C, 6C, 214B, and chain shift if you got it
[1:23:53] <micmic112> her 22C is just ex 22A/B
[1:24:04] <micmic112> BUT her 22C is an overhead
[1:24:06] <MTLxSpider> Force function photnon is a good antiair
[1:24:15] <MTLxSpider> and can also be charged
[1:24:38] <+ALTRNico> so it's like BB
[1:24:43] <fgiting> Crossups aren’t that real in this game
[1:24:45] <micmic112> uh no
[1:24:49] <micmic112> in BB you can block in the air
[1:24:57] <+NarcissistCactus> blazblue has air stuff
[1:24:58] <micmic112> BUT certain ground moves are air unblockable
[1:25:05] <+ALTRNico> ah right. I was thinking of ground to air
[1:25:06] <didgereedoodah> most grounded moves are air unblockable in BB
[1:25:09] <MTLxSpider> IT COST GRD METER
[1:25:21] <UnbreakableDoof> only out of it if he got vorp
[1:25:35] <+ALTRNico> A button is blockable in air but not B and C if i remember correctly
[1:25:36] <UnbreakableDoof> no vorpal = no combo off his FF
[1:25:37] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:25:37] <+Wyrmidon> some characters like Chaos & Seth have real crossups @fgiting
[1:25:47] <FatDragonQuest> so pardon if this is dumb but neutral game is basically footsies until someone screws up
[1:26:02] <UnbreakableDoof> it's very footsies based
[1:26:05] <+Mercer618> Fullscreen footsies in a lot of cases but yes
[1:26:05] <%SkaiVibration> whats the difference between shield and block?
[1:26:19] <Twoiis> No phonon is going to do that full screen away lol.
[1:26:19] <GuillotineEm17> block is just hold back
[1:26:29] <+Wyrmidon> shield changes pushback/recovery, block is just your normal defence
[1:26:29] <GuillotineEm17> Sheild is when you hold back + D
[1:26:30] <MTLxSpider> oh yeah 22C is overhead
[1:26:32] <MTLxSpider> lol
[1:26:34] <MTLxSpider> for phonon
[1:26:44] <%SkaiVibration> yh but like what does shield do?
[1:26:47] <jubejube56> I'd guess shield is just faultless defense
[1:26:49] <%sou1less_> shiled gives grid and acts almost like push block, block is just block
[1:26:58] <+DesertOfSand> Shield is a committed option. If successful, you gain GRD and have less blockstun, but you can't change your blocking (so if you're standing you cannot block low), and you cannot tech throws, and an unsuccessful Shield results in a GRD Break
[1:26:58] <%SkaiVibration> ah ok kewl
[1:27:14] <MTLxSpider> @WoolieVersus did you explain the difference between blue shield and green shield
[1:27:16] <UnbreakableDoof> @SkaiVibration Shield builds GRD, makes anything it blocks -3 more on block, makes air normals uncancelable (kill them when the land), and prevents chip damage
[1:27:18] <Mpgame99> Talk about reverse beat
[1:27:18] <+BSplitz> certain moves are also only punishible by shield
[1:27:19] <+DesertOfSand> Unsuccessful meaning you took damage
[1:27:20] <%SkaiVibration> oh nice
[1:27:24] <%SkaiVibration> thx chat!
[1:27:25] <@Menitta> The tutorial is excellent.
[1:27:29] <+ALTRNico> YES PLAY THE TUTORIAL
[1:27:34] <kaine_west> ranked to get blown up by online warriors
[1:27:39] <+BSplitz> best tutorial ever
[1:27:42] <MTLxSpider> oh no not this again
[1:27:51] <MTLxSpider> ok phew
[1:27:51] <UnbreakableDoof> @SkaiVibration The risk though is that shield can be broken if you block wrong, and that can go bad
[1:27:53] <@Menitta> I like that fact
[1:27:53] <+DesertOfSand> Yeah, going back to what I said earlier
[1:27:53] <KantusMonkus> animal planet fighting games
[1:27:54] <%GunterDriger6> LUL
[1:27:59] <RyuuAoi> DO TIME ATTACK
[1:28:01] <@Menitta> Good Frog Fact
[1:28:09] <VampirePeriod> frog commentary
[1:28:10] <+DesertOfSand> DO NOT choose Display All when choosing a tutorial. It will mix the difficulties.
[1:28:12] <+AllenDeadman> can I find some of those in ohio? we relly could use them there
[1:28:12] <Laironx3> OSFrog
[1:28:13] <UnbreakableDoof> risky blocks
[1:28:15] <+DesertOfSand> The better thing to do is take it course by course
[1:28:15] <FanxService> hey woole when are you coming to locals
[1:28:19] <+ALTRNico> MY LOCAL DOESNT PLAY UNIST :(
[1:28:21] <%GunterDriger6> True! Support your locals!
[1:28:24] <%SkaiVibration> @UnbreakableDoof i see so pretty dangerous but high risk high reward
[1:28:31] <Finaldragoon> I don't have the gas money to drive 100+ miles a week for "locals"
[1:28:31] <@Menitta> I'll go if someone can tell me where a central MD local is...
[1:28:32] <giveupwithavengeance> just go to your locals that are 3 hours away bro...
[1:28:32] <UnbreakableDoof> yeye
[1:28:34] <stormhawk9891> I still can't finish this tutorial, that veteran stuff is crazy
[1:28:39] <%SkaiVibration> noice
[1:28:40] <BearSawed> HA. Locals....Dead scene is dead
[1:28:41] <giveupwithavengeance> btw all they play is smash...
[1:28:42] <MTLxSpider> @ALTRNico just boot the game up. and training mode. its that simple
[1:28:44] <RyuuAoi> SUPPORT LOCAL EVERYTHING. Please. Thank you!
[1:28:45] <UnbreakableDoof> especially blocking air moves
[1:28:47] <%sou1less_> yeah my local doesn't do units either
[1:28:53] <KantusMonkus> the dash block tutorial is super good
[1:28:54] <%sou1less_> unist*
[1:28:58] <FlamingNarwhal> my locals are just smash
[1:29:05] <FlamingNarwhal> crendorFrog1
[1:29:07] <+DesertOfSand> Seeing people getting blown up by the dash block tutorial is the fucking greatest
[1:29:10] <Twoiis> I still haven't completed the tutorial tech OS.
[1:29:11] <UnbreakableDoof> if people are jumping at you, shielding makes what would be a safe blockstring into HEAVY disadvantage
[1:29:13] <+Cebardo> Reverse beat fuckers
[1:29:18] <%SkaiVibration> shielding air normals sounds like a big dick move lol
[1:29:19] <+Cebardo> yall forgot!
[1:29:21] <+ALTRNico> @MTLxSpider I'm actually enjoying playing arcade
[1:29:24] <%GunterDriger6> Reverse Baet!
[1:29:24] <stormhawk9891> Reverse beat
[1:29:25] <EnderGamma> vruh
[1:29:27] <+seaearthandsky> reverse beat
[1:29:31] <UnbreakableDoof> REVERSE FUCKING BEAT, LES GO
[1:29:31] <+Mercer618> REVERSE BEEEEEAT
[1:29:32] <Mpgame99> YAY REVERSE BEAT
[1:29:33] <Gonewiththevoid> reverse beat
[1:29:34] <stormhawk9891> how could y'all forget
[1:29:36] <+SlowLikeThunder> @WoolieVersus Reverse Beat is the name
[1:29:37] <%GunterDriger6> *Beat
[1:29:38] <+Wyrmidon> rebeat
[1:29:38] <+ALTRNico> it's adult gohan system
[1:29:41] <MTLxSpider> doing arcade is actually a good way to practice
[1:29:41] <UnbreakableDoof> Should be a universal mechanic
[1:29:44] <RyuuAoi> @flamingnarwhal My Locals are Smash, DB Fighters, and I believe SF.
[1:29:45] <beatie_g> EVERYONE gets a reverse beat
[1:29:46] <UnbreakableDoof> really
[1:29:48] <MTLxSpider> cuz you are fighitng a moving CPU.
[1:29:53] <MTLxSpider> unlike training mode
[1:30:17] <fluke_LKZ> Oh shit, is Woolie also collecting the French Bread Money? PogChamp
[1:30:19] <@Menitta> I like this feature because it means scrubs like me can still do combo
[1:30:22] <shadowmaksim> @WoolieVersus You can also repeat normals if you autocombo into them after.
[1:30:23] <UnbreakableDoof> Reverse beat makes you feel so goddamn free
[1:30:30] <KantusMonkus> french bread money PogChamp
[1:30:32] <giveupwithavengeance> whiff A after a sweep to OTG Kreygasm
[1:30:34] <+DesertOfSand> For example, Mika Increase 5C is -1 on block, but if you do 5[C] whiff 5A, it's +7
[1:30:35] <DrBeefcastle> rebeat is the best
[1:30:38] <Mpgame99> Reverse beat is REALLY important in this game
[1:31:00] <jubejube56> Lol just remembered that Adult Gohan supposedly gets Reverse Beat and never uses it
[1:31:02] <Mpgame99> Like it’s one of the defining features
[1:31:04] <stormhawk9891> The trade off is that combos scale according to the strength of the first hit
[1:31:11] <DrBeefcastle> yeah rebeat is a huge deal
[1:31:45] <@Menitta> Wait reverse beat is different from passing link
[1:31:46] <+DesertOfSand> 3Cw2A is also used across many characters for antiairs
[1:31:52] <lordreginald> @WoolieVersus the reverse beat also means any move, not just button, so you can technically start with 5A and end with 2A for example
[1:31:56] <KantusMonkus> dashblock is the first veteran tutorial
[1:32:01] <Mpgame99> Passing link is just the official name
[1:32:04] <+Wyrmidon> comand priorities talks about how DP gets priority over fireball @WoolieVersus
[1:32:07] <@Menitta> oh
[1:32:13] <+Wyrmidon> in terms of input
[1:32:28] <+ALTRNico> but reverse beat implies you can only do CBA and not BAC
[1:32:41] <%Solidnick18> hello
[1:32:41] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:32:44] <kaine_west> true combos
[1:32:49] <+DesertOfSand> Technically yes, but also people still say Reverse Beat anyway
[1:32:53] <%Solidnick18> oh nice some uniest
[1:32:55] <+Shotgundam009> some of the wording was a bit off to me in the tutorial but other than that its fantastic.
[1:33:06] <KnightReis> i've seen way too many eltnum bustacap hit confirms into ex bustacap
[1:33:29] <fluke_LKZ> This is a very good lesson, because one of the biggest pitfalls for new players is not knowing when to stop a combo when an opponent is blocking
[1:33:33] <DrBeefcastle> the main problem with the tutorial is they rename a bunch of fg terms that already exist and have terms, which can be confusing
[1:33:38] <ZippyPsycho> Balls exposed on stream
[1:33:41] <+DesertOfSand> Yeah, it's names galore
[1:33:42] <DrBeefcastle> but the lessons are still all S-tier
[1:34:02] <KantusMonkus> oh man i forgout guard thrust is a thing
[1:34:04] <+ALTRNico> I mean have you seen the wall of text /s
[1:34:09] <%SkaiVibration> the okidoke
[1:34:14] <jubejube56> lol why do they rename so much but keep oki?
[1:34:17] <DrBeefcastle> at least they called oki what it is instead of some shit like "Aggression Awakening"
[1:34:20] <+javonero15> Guard Thrust
[1:34:31] <+DesertOfSand> In Japanese: Oki. In America: Guessies
[1:34:34] <+NarcissistCactus> okazumi
[1:34:39] <RyuuAoi> "Okizeme" member dat!
[1:34:51] <kaine_west> oki is universal
[1:34:57] <MTLxSpider> okizumi
[1:35:08] <MTLxSpider> okidokio
[1:35:11] <MTLxSpider> okidoki
[1:35:11] <RyuuAoi> Not in SMASH though!
[1:35:11] <UnbreakableDoof> I hope I can connect good
[1:35:13] <gordieda20> LUL
[1:35:19] <DrBeefcastle> mmm I love that meaty oki for breakfast
[1:35:20] <ghostravens> i'll be honest...i never understood what a meaty is
[1:35:21] <UnbreakableDoof> i am on the other side of NA I think from where woolie is
[1:35:23] <+NarcissistCactus> good thing there are no aris subs here
[1:35:24] <ghostravens> i am the ultra scrub
[1:35:26] <%sou1less_> LUL
[1:35:28] <MTLxSpider> smash they call it tech chase.
[1:35:30] <mirum> breakfast is such a good name
[1:35:36] <DrBeefcastle> @ghostravens a meaty is just a move that hits the opponent on frame 1 of them standing
[1:35:42] <giveupwithavengeance> I think meaty started out just meaning a move with a lot of active frames
[1:35:55] <Twoiis> I forgot about guard thrust. Never used it.
[1:35:55] <beatie_g> DP for breakfast again FeelsBadMan
[1:35:57] <+ALTRNico> alpha counter
[1:36:01] <giveupwithavengeance> but because of that it now means connecting with a later active frame
[1:36:05] <ghostravens> @DrBeefcastle right, thank you
[1:36:09] <@Solidus_113> what's the difference between this and push blocking?
[1:36:10] <DrBeefcastle> np
[1:36:26] <+DesertOfSand> Push blocking moves the opponent away while you're still blcoking. Guard Thrust is an attack from a guarding state
[1:36:31] <%Solidnick18> right
[1:36:39] <MTLxSpider> guard trust knockem down. pushblocking doesnt.
[1:36:57] <+DesertOfSand> In UNIST, Green Shielding is similar to pushblocking
[1:37:20] <DrBeefcastle> the only guard thrusts I've ever done were accidental
[1:37:22] <+Wyrmidon> it's usefull if you are about to be grabbed after a greenshield
[1:37:24] <DrBeefcastle> but god are they hype
[1:37:42] <KantusMonkus> i wanna see woolie do the dashblock tutorial
[1:37:43] <+DesertOfSand> Oh man I never even thought about using Guard Thrust when Green Shielding
[1:37:51] <gatorafan> But what if I need it later monkaS
[1:37:51] <kaine_west> well if you don't wanna get blown up, its pretty good to learn fundamentals
[1:37:54] <EnderGamma> dash block mission now
[1:38:01] <+DesertOfSand> Yes, please, do the dash block mission
[1:38:10] <+DesertOfSand> The stream needs to see it
[1:38:26] <+ALTRNico> is that the one with Vatista?
[1:38:29] <+Wyrmidon> yes
[1:38:29] <KantusMonkus> everybody gangsta til vatista holds downback
[1:38:29] <TheyCallMeVawn> Dash block mission is super important
[1:38:31] <EnderGamma> yeah
[1:38:34] <FatDragonQuest> I gotta get going, thanks for the stream, woolie!
[1:38:52] <jubejube56> Well that assumes everything sticks
[1:38:56] <KnightReis> oh shit vatista is crouching what is she up to

[1:40:09] <EnderGamma> BibleThump
[1:40:29] <Hispanacomida25> I mean I occasionally play against someone who's way experienced and usually I go 3-20 with them but they helped me learn characters and what others can do, it feels great

[1:41:20] <MForan98> @WoolieVersus watch it in action to get a better idea!
[1:41:24] <KantusMonkus> yuzu veteran combos PogChamp
[1:41:28] <%TeethMuncher> A dash of c, a litte of a, and you got it
[1:41:44] <+Wyrmidon> the missions do a pretty good job of building up to the later combos teaching you the routing in pieces
[1:41:46] <GuillotineEm17> I need to rewatch that vid of Leffen trying to do Yuzu combos
[1:41:51] <RyuuAoi> Now remember ALL dat
[1:42:05] <Hispanacomida25> leffen tried to play Yuzu?

[1:42:42] <haveswordmuststing> Leffen played Under Night?
[1:42:44] <DesertOfSand> My favorite video is Sajam looking at UNIST and calling out the chat for lying to him when he sees Wagner doing instant assault A CS
[1:42:45] <kaine_west> Dyrus is an inspiration that i too can play a hard game with serious combos
[1:42:46] <DrBeefcastle> god the tutorials in this game rule, most robust shit I've seen in a fg besides Skullgirls
[1:42:48] <%TeethMuncher> Can't wait for EVO
[1:42:48] <GuillotineEm17> but the vid its in is "Leffen Plays UNIST: The Experience"
[1:43:13] <Triplicat> UNICLR HYPE
[1:43:14] <tmo200> The tactics section is od since it literally tells u your poking buttons and what r good pressure tooks
[1:43:23] <tmo200> For that specific character

[1:43:47] <shryoc> anime notation is also god tier

[1:58:13] <DrBeefcastle> Byakuya is challenging but a setplay MONSTER
[1:58:14] <KantusMonkus> byakuya is for degenerates
[1:58:17] <Hispanacomida25> @dj_jellocups Lobby
[1:58:19] <+seaearthandsky> byakuya is fucking crazy

[1:58:25] <GuillotineEm17> Byak setplay is gross
[1:58:26] <KnightReis> ey its supaidaman
[1:58:27] <DesertOfSand> Solid mid tier is certainly AN opinion
[1:58:28] <@Menitta> This game's spectator mode is on another level
[1:58:29] <Triplicat> PLEASE TURN IT ON
[1:58:29] <%Solidnick18> i seen it
[1:58:32] <Triplicat> oh wait he's playing
[1:58:32] <%Toynota10> He so creepy
[1:58:33] <Triplicat> damn it
[1:58:40] <RyuuAoi> Yoooo General back back in!
[1:58:45] <DrBeefcastle> Byakuya and Hilda are your setplay nightmares if you wanna just put people in the vortex
[1:58:47] <+seaearthandsky> he is set play the character, even more so then seth
[1:58:52] <haveswordmuststing> @toynota10 he's creepier if you learn about his sister
[1:58:54] <DrBeefcastle> Seth too, yeah
[1:58:56] <Gonewiththevoid> clearlamp has made me scared of byakuya vicariously
[1:59:01] <%Toynota10> hahahaha anime
[1:59:09] <anarchistPastry> upgrab? whats upgrab?
[1:59:13] <%Toynota10> @WoolieVersus How about Chaos?
[1:59:18] <LandOfTheWay> byak's gameplay is the good kind of creepy, but his story is the bad kind
[1:59:18] <ChaotixSpark> Fillia for Uniclr pls.
[1:59:19] <@Solidus_113> SKULLGIRLS FILIA
[1:59:19] <+foxide_> im hoping Granblue will be good
[1:59:20] <+BSplitz> lamp just a monster with byakua
[1:59:21] <RyuuAoi> Woolie sweatin'
[1:59:22] <DesertOfSand> Mika can 214C through Byak webs, since they count as grabs for some reason, which is fun
[1:59:24] <+Pyrotrooper> Kyo Kusanagi
[1:59:24] <%TeethMuncher> uniclear sounds like a nail polish
[1:59:30] <jaedongfan90> they should put nanaya in uniclear
[1:59:31] <stormhawk9891> Filia
[1:59:34] <@Menitta> Filia is the right answer
[1:59:38] <Kurodius> I am not seeing the room at all, what can I do to fix this?
[1:59:44] <Triplicat> may be full
[1:59:46] <$FuqBoiSlim> fukuwa
[1:59:47] <haveswordmuststing> i forget, was that Filia artwork a full sprite or illustration
[1:59:47] <+IHATREID> 2B should honestly be a guest in every game
[1:59:49] <Triplicat> very likely full
[1:59:49] <KantusMonkus> negan being in tekken changed everything
[1:59:50] <DesertOfSand> The room has a private slot so you should always be able to see it
[1:59:50] <FlamingNarwhal> negan in unclr
[1:59:50] <+NarcissistCactus> wait for it to not be full
[1:59:50] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 2 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 8oz (240mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.

[2:00:24] <dj_jellocups> are they playing ranked on ps4?
[2:00:26] <+balouie> is this game done by the people who do melty blood?
[2:00:30] <+javonero15> terry was seen by a long shot
[2:00:31] <gatorafan> I say less Kyo and more Iori, at least for this game.
[2:00:33] <%GlewmanIII> @balouie yes
[2:00:34] <fluke_LKZ> @balouie Yes
[2:00:34] <AComptonG> grd is important for eltnum
[2:00:34] <+Wyrmidon> PS4 lobby
[2:00:40] <+BSplitz> it's a player lobby
[2:00:41] <ChaotixSpark> Riesbyfe is already in this game though. She has a shield sword and fire aesthetic.
[2:00:42] <kaine_west> Vanessa in UNICLEAR Kreygasm
[2:00:45] <DrBeefcastle> GRD is hugely important in the higher levels of this game
[2:00:45] <+balouie> ok I th9ought it looked familar
[2:00:48] <beatie_g> elt is kinda rough but she's still usable
[2:00:50] <DrBeefcastle> it makes or breaks some characters
[2:00:53] <RyuuAoi> Remember Tyron?
[2:00:56] <Hispanacomida25> Wagner is also a good character
[2:00:57] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:00:57] <@Solidus_113> can I get Big Band in every fighting game?
[2:01:12] <AComptonG> elt is very strong though, senaru just took 2nd or 3rd at KSB
[2:01:15] <RyuuAoi> Remember Tron? YOU WORRY ABOUT THE GRID.
[2:01:15] <alrobot2014> wool taking the IE
[2:01:17] <%Toynota10> Does this game have crossplay?
[2:01:17] <haveswordmuststing> @solidus_113 hey now, not before Zubaz
[2:01:17] <%TeethMuncher> glad to see anime has made it all the way to texas
[2:01:19] <DrBeefcastle> I very much support the universal Big Band system in fg's
[2:01:21] <KnightReis> yeah but wagner doesn't have a pilebunker that looks like a cello
[2:01:28] <jubejube56> Solidus if you are lucky you may have a fighting game where somebody wields a single tuba
[2:01:29] <DesertOfSand> UNIST does not have cross play
[2:01:33] <+IHATREID> diggin this art style
[2:01:35] <dj_jellocups> wahta's the pass?
[2:01:37] <DesertOfSand> If UNICLR has crossplay, that would give me a fucking orgasm
[2:01:40] <%GlewmanIII> why 1 private slot
[2:01:40] <dj_jellocups> or is it public?
[2:01:45] <%Toynota10> Hmm. Do any fighting games have crossplay?
[2:01:48] <PinkSocks> Yeaah Sion
[2:01:49] <%GlewmanIII> sfv

[2:04:32] <%Toynota10> Like, half circles, back-forwards, stuff like that
[2:04:47] <RyuuAoi> @menitta You put up a GOODT fight
[2:05:00] <dj_jellocups> there's a setting for connection limit you can change it to however many bar minimum you want
[2:05:00] <jimmytwofeet> IKUZO
[2:05:00] <+Star____> Wait is Houston west coast?
[2:05:06] <%GunterDriger6> @Wool Texas Showdown was awesome!
[2:05:07] <%GlewmanIII> No, houston is central
[2:05:07] <giveupwithavengeance> trust me bro I got the good kind of wifi...
[2:05:08] <dj_jellocups> What's the pass for the lobby?
[2:05:11] <ChaotixSpark> Back forwards? Do you mean charge inputs? Vatista is a charge character yes.
[2:05:11] <jubejube56> Texas is east
[2:05:15] <+Star____> Ok I’m fine then
[2:05:19] <Smileyhat> @Wool I'm near Dallas, actually. Issue is it's hard to get to locals. Got no car.
[2:05:19] <+javonero15> We have a scene near Chicago
[2:05:22] <Gonewiththevoid> linne has a half circle special, and vatista has inversed charge commands
[2:05:23] <%Toynota10> Dps and quarter circles are easy to do, but sometimes my controller doesn't read me doing half circles
[2:05:24] <ChaotixSpark> Hey Star!
[2:05:28] <fluke_LKZ> BabyRage But my PS4 is right next to the router, Woolie!
[2:05:32] <KnightReis> you get 1 charge character, most characters have quarter circles and double downs, everyone has a half circle ultra
[2:05:32] <FatDragonQuest> I can't find the room at all
[2:05:34] <+javonero15> Tripoint is a good local or Ignite
[2:05:36] <+Star____> Sup Sparx !
[2:05:37] <%GlewmanIII> Seattle too, GameWorks every tuesday night
[2:05:40] <NoxAlchemist> wifi is wack, but don't bully us shit internet players pls
[2:05:40] <thunderhog> you cant just discriminate against poverty.
[2:05:41] <+NarcissistCactus> room is full
[2:05:42] <spardanwarrior> @Toynota10 Pretty much only quarter circles, half circles, DPs, a few 360s, and down down for special motians.
[2:05:43] <%Toynota10> I guess I just gotta practice more
[2:05:45] <+mtlnx> its mostly quarter circle and dragon punch motions but a few things are half circle including the supers
[2:05:46] <%TeethMuncher> Don't turn fighting games into a slide show
[2:05:46] <ChaotixSpark> The input window in this game is stricted than in others also @Toynota10
[2:05:47] <UnbreakableDoof> FUCK, 1 BAR CONNECTION
[2:05:57] <KantusMonkus> everybody gangsta til the shackles come off
[2:05:58] <dj_jellocups> javonero, you coming down to tripoint for casuals this week?
[2:06:00] <UnbreakableDoof> I am no disappointed
[2:06:08] <+Star____> 1 bar isn’t that bad bro only 10 frames of lag Kappa
[2:06:10] <giveupwithavengeance> 4 FRAME FailFish
[2:06:14] <+Star____> Just got gud
[2:06:15] <giveupwithavengeance> NotLikeThis
[2:06:16] <FenixSeraph> Enkidu looks a fair amount more like how mythological Enkidu was supposed to look
[2:06:21] <RyuuAoi> You got this, Wolve!
[2:06:22] <+MoonlightP> @WoolieVersus just fyi any stage in this game that isn't on training stage runs into stutter
[2:06:25] <%Toynota10> Oh man 360s. Are those just for EX moves or do any characters have a regular 360 moves?
[2:06:26] <DesertOfSand> You ever play against an Akatsuki with 10f lag? B T A T S U
[2:06:27] <+MoonlightP> Online at least
[2:06:27] <UnbreakableDoof> Very upset
[2:06:37] <KantusMonkus> park or training stage are the best for netplay
[2:06:42] <%GlewmanIII> spectating doesnt add lag @WoolieVersus
[2:06:45] <+javonero15> @dj_jellocups I'm in Mexico for vacation rn I won't be back until for ComboBreaker
[2:06:46] <+mtlnx> theres a bug where sometimes a spectator can hold up the match at the end but they can't cause lag
[2:06:53] <KnightReis> make a fighter where twitch chat can gift buffs to players
[2:07:00] <+AllenDeadman> you just insulted his verizon wifi, he's pissed
[2:07:04] <UnbreakableDoof> Is there even remotely a chance to check the frame delay for 1 bar?
[2:07:04] <dj_jellocups> cool, I might see you there man
[2:07:08] <%Toynota10> @WoolieVersus Did you see the new Sam Sho trailer today? They announced that the game records how you play so that you can fight a ghost version of yourself!
[2:07:09] <ChaotixSpark> I always quote Trill on this. "4 frames barely resembles a fighting game."
[2:07:17] <RyuuAoi> Block, Wolve
[2:07:22] <+Wyrmidon> alt tab on PC breaks lobbies
[2:07:31] <%GlewmanIII> frame delay is always at the top of the screen @UnbreakableDoof
[2:07:32] <+javonero15> I want to go to Tripoint but I'm always hit with plans for out of town
[2:07:37] <AGtheOG> They are a jury
[2:07:38] <haveswordmuststing> @toynota10 the Shadow mode was known for a while
[2:07:41] <wolvenelf> gg
[2:07:48] <%Toynota10> It was? Huh
[2:07:52] <Smileyhat> @toynota10 Really? That sounds pretty cool.
[2:07:53] <AGtheOG> If no one sees it, it didn't happen. It's science
[2:07:56] <+javonero15> I've been growing my small locals in Dekalb @dj_jellocups
[2:08:03] <LandOfTheWay> "one cannot fly with just one wing" say that to sephiroth

[2:08:19] <nuwxves> is there a password?
[2:08:22] <+BSplitz> 3 bar good connection GANG GANG
[2:08:22] <%Toynota10> No
[2:08:24] <UnbreakableDoof> Disappointed
[2:08:37] <tmo200> Dang, it's probably cuz im on west coast
[2:08:40] <UnbreakableDoof> Big disappoint
[2:08:40] <RyuuAoi> Ahhhh :(
[2:08:42] <wolvenelf> it has to be this way though
[2:08:44] <Thalchampz> this is why i don't play online
[2:08:45] <gatorafan> Plebeians not allowed on this room Kappa
[2:08:51] <JanusII> In the end you realize you were just like me tried to make history.
[2:08:55] <%GunterDriger6> Hope they'll accept me...
[2:08:55] <%Toynota10> They don't got that Fiber Optic Internet
[2:08:56] <%yeknomlive> get the zip file ready
[2:08:56] <AGtheOG> LUL no socks

[2:08:58] <%GlewmanIII> LEMME SEE THEM TOES
[2:08:59] <+MoonlightP> Phonon's colours are godlike tbh
[2:09:00] <spardanwarrior> @Toynota10 EX moves are just regular motion with heavy, no unique motions for supers. Been a while since I checked but I think that only one character has 360s and its the grappler.
[2:09:01] <+BSplitz> even in Florida I have a 3 bar, wow
[2:09:03] <%binkarus> Why haven't we invented FTL communication for the fighting games?!?
[2:09:04] <AGtheOG> He hates Mic Foley
[2:09:04] <@Solidus_113> that's a good palette though
[2:09:04] <UnbreakableDoof> wanted to show off my Semi-competent merkava
[2:09:05] <+skLaFarebear> please god give uniclr rollback netcode
[2:09:07] <%Toynota10> Did someone say Bepes?
[2:09:08] <UnbreakableDoof> so sad
[2:09:09] <+MoonlightP> Stockings of various lengths vs bare leg
[2:09:14] <giveupwithavengeance> she's 15 you pervs TearGlove
[2:09:15] <%linkwolf4> Reggie we didn't need that shit.
[2:09:16] <%binkarus> stockings
[2:09:16] <thunderhog> Also feet and legs are a whole nother thing
[2:09:18] <DesertOfSand> Hilda is like 17, isn't she?
[2:09:20] <UnbreakableDoof> damn shame
[2:09:22] <KantusMonkus> 19
[2:09:23] <Gonewiththevoid> still reeling that hildas supposed to be like 19
[2:09:25] <ChaotixSpark> Also, @WoolieVersus Pick Park or training stage. It helps netplay connections from being less shit.

[2:16:47] <+BSplitz> what a great song
[2:16:48] <+TruSpindash> Play this song at Evo grands SourPls
[2:16:48] <NoxAlchemist> the difference between this and mika's theme is that mika's theme is good
[2:16:52] <+TheIntellectional> it's a good song, if they had just picked a less aggressive lead it would've been fine
[2:16:52] <%GlewmanIII> It sounds like a pokemon town theme
[2:16:54] <giveupwithavengeance> discordant bike horns
[2:16:59] <KantusMonkus> mika's theme slaps
[2:17:01] <blue2red> sounds like magical girl track
[2:17:07] <gatorafan> I only listen to mature fighting game soundtracks for mature gamers like myself Kappa
[2:17:10] <spardanwarrior> Reminds me of Hoenn
[2:17:21] <Forgottenblade_> Holy crap i made it while your playing a game Woolie!!
[2:17:27] <KantusMonkus> i actually have nanase theme as my alarm

[2:18:06] <%Wool> I like how Woolie keeps making comparisons to BB
[2:18:12] <Forgottenblade_> Ya i never see him on though i always see his previous videos
[2:18:12] <DrBeefcastle> god I wish I could get in this room to get bodied
[2:18:26] <haveswordmuststing> @wool he's learning on how to be wrong like pat
[2:18:27] <ChaotixSpark> Wish i could get in this lobby to trash this pho. :P
[2:18:27] <thunderhog> BB's a good comparison for anime gimmicks
[2:18:49] <giveupwithavengeance> fg on a tv FailFish
[2:18:52] <DesertOfSand> Mika's theme pls
[2:18:52] <%binkarus> my eyes can only see 30FPS though

[2:19:22] <+BSplitz> anyone else not in the lobby hop on ranked!
[2:19:27] <+SlowLikeThunder> Any Nanase tips? I'm trying to learn her atm
[2:19:33] <+ALTRNico> Linne theme kreygasm
[2:19:33] <stormhawk9891> Linne's theme is the fucking best
[2:19:36] <KantusMonkus> linne is sick
[2:19:39] <+MoonlightP> UNI's a lot less wild than BB. The game has some anime gimmicks but for the most part they're pretty reserved and the characters don't get a specific mechanic to ignore or subvert rules generally
[2:19:42] <KantusMonkus> kuuga gang
[2:19:42] <DrBeefcastle> do the train from fullscreen always that's my only nanase tip
[2:19:44] <jubejube56> ooo funky Z slash there
[2:19:46] <jsavarin> Merkava is best girl
[2:19:47] <DrBeefcastle> just choo choo fullscreen all day baby
[2:19:47] <%Wool> lmao, I unlocked a trophy fighting Woolie
[2:19:47] <%Toynota10> Linne vs Gordeau is a really bad matchup right?
[2:19:52] <%SilvaChariot0133> gettin taken for a ride here
[2:19:52] <haveswordmuststing> i just say L*ne like the texting app
[2:19:55] <ChaotixSpark> If they're jumping a bunch @SlowLikeThunder 6B your set play fireballs to send them up.
[2:19:55] <+skLaFarebear> Linne bnbs PogChamp
[2:19:56] <+MoonlightP> Best theme btw is Hyde vs Seth
[2:20:01] <+DarkNerdShawny> Linne PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[2:20:06] <%GlewmanIII> is there a keyword on the room?
[2:20:09] <%Toynota10> No
[2:20:12] <%GlewmanIII> tyty
[2:20:12] <DrBeefcastle> @Toynota10 I always get blown up by Linne players, so I'd say so
[2:20:12] <%Solidnick18> linne is very good i think
[2:20:19] <23rald> her theme's SeemsGood
[2:20:23] <DrBeefcastle> Linne is pretty solid, a little stubby tho
[2:20:24] <%sou1less_> linnes rush down is pretty crazy
[2:20:26] <NoxAlchemist> vatista theme is underrated
[2:20:29] <DesertOfSand> There's this one Linne player Darkhero on PC who just fucking bodies me nonstop
[2:20:33] <thunderhog> I remember looking back at trailers for UNiB going "how is this little girl supposed to fight with the dumb huge range of Wald and merkava"
[2:20:34] <DesertOfSand> At some point I gotta go learn the matchup
[2:20:35] <+MoonlightP> Mika's theme is also godlike
[2:20:41] <KantusMonkus> linne is super sick and easy to learn
[2:20:43] <ChaotixSpark> That's funny @Solidnick18 the community are arguing a bunch that she's the worst safe for enkidu ofc.
[2:20:45] <%binkarus> trapped
[2:20:46] <shryoc> Good followups after 3CC
[2:20:48] <DesertOfSand> Mika's theme is legit great
[2:20:49] <sir_nack> sonic got combos
[2:21:01] <+ALTRNico> nice
[2:21:04] <%Solidnick18> @ChaotixSpark oh ok
[2:21:06] <official_nakmatic> ps4 only lobby?
[2:21:11] <%SilvaChariot0133> F
[2:21:13] <DrBeefcastle> fun fact, they made Gordeau originally bc they needed an "old man," and they realized he didn't have enough range for 16:9, so they gave him a scythe to go with his claws
[2:21:15] <+DarkNerdShawny> F

[2:21:24] <gatorafan> NotLikeThis
[2:21:25] <ChaotixSpark> Not saying the community is right, but people say Linne's game plan is too predictable.
[2:21:26] <thunderhog> wait that was intentional?
[2:21:42] <+ALTRNico> @WoolieVersus cancel your running C to 214 fireball
[2:21:43] <ChaotixSpark> Which i can see. But a good linne will still make you scramble.
[2:21:50] <+javonero15> you have to work for it
[2:21:51] <%Solidnick18> i like the red

[2:22:20] <DesertOfSand> Light Blue is the lowest, but you pretty much have to intentionally work to get it. I've never seen a player with Light Blue
[2:22:25] <DarkVinceX> spaghettis everywhere
[2:22:28] <+BSplitz> perfects are fairly common in this
[2:22:35] <ChaotixSpark> No one is good at fighting games. getting good is a life style, not a goal.
[2:22:45] <%Wool> @DesertOfSand I'm Light Blue in most fighters but I do it purposely lol
[2:22:48] <KnightReis> just know that being able to do a fireball is arcane knowledge to some
[2:22:51] <@Menitta> woolieSMUG
[2:22:56] <APB_Harleqyn> @ChaotixSpark godlike response
[2:22:59] <DrBeefcastle> I've seen like 1 light blue, and they had a record like 3/50, mad respect to them tho for being persistent

[2:26:28] <Quikanims> Chaos Code does that

[2:38:21] <RyuuAoi> Welp
[2:38:31] <didgereedoodah> kuuga
[2:38:48] <Roasted_Pheasant> I think Merkava is the weirdest fighting game character. Weirder than Arakune. Weirder than Faust.
[2:39:00] <%GlewmanIII> nah arakune is def weirder
[2:39:01] <FrustratedAF> in bersu
[2:39:03] <didgereedoodah> how
[2:39:08] <didgereedoodah> how do you believe that
[2:39:10] <%binkarus> oof
[2:39:12] <+ALTRNico> just mash reversal
[2:39:13] <+NarcissistCactus> arakune exists
[2:39:15] <ChaotixSpark> What's weird about Merkava?
[2:39:18] <+NarcissistCactus> look at his moveset
[2:39:19] <ChaotixSpark> He's a zoner.
[2:39:21] <+DarkNerdShawny> Linne is the best :clap: character :clap: on :clap: the :clap: roster :clap:
[2:39:22] <%linkwolf4> @roasted_pheasant weirder then voldo tho?
[2:39:25] <Roasted_Pheasant> The long, floppy arms with the disappearing mouth

[2:39:40] <%Solidnick18> see them scythe bois
[2:39:40] <@Menitta> Yeah thats why I dig this more than GG or BB
[2:39:42] <+theunforgivingsquid> @roasted_pheasant I don't arakune is full of bugs
[2:39:42] <ChaotixSpark> Do you mean weird as in character design or weird as in mechanics?
[2:39:45] <KantusMonkus> gord PogChamp
[2:39:45] <jsavarin> it's the street fighter of anime fighters
[2:39:48] <+NarcissistCactus> hook sub playing gordeau cirSlain
[2:39:51] <+AllenDeadman> have you seen freaking arakune players in BB?
[2:39:52] <KnightReis> yeah but arakune is a bag with things in it, not a person
[2:39:58] <Sol_Install> this game is tamer than most anime games
[2:40:03] <$FuqBoiSlim> HOOK
[2:40:05] <haisho> oh no GURIMU REEPPAA
[2:40:05] <@Menitta> Unlike getting near double perfected by a Potempkin.....
[2:40:08] <%CaptainPileDriver> this game is so much more comprehensible then most arcsys games
[2:40:09] <@Menitta> woolieDATTEBAYO
[2:40:15] <%Toynota10> I still dunno why I'm not interested in BlazBlue. Maybe its the art design
[2:40:31] <DrBeefcastle> yo this Gord is wild good!
[2:40:44] <+TheIntellectional> style points
[2:40:50] <+AllenDeadman> he fisted you
[2:40:50] <+theunforgivingsquid> I love BlazBlue's art
[2:40:52] <RyuuAoi> @gunterdriger6 YOU'RE COMING UP. Study this shite like a hawk
[2:40:54] <Sol_Install> i can say the art style got me into BB
[2:40:54] <pyookoomookoo> i find most of the bb cast unlikeable
[2:40:58] <KantusMonkus> gimme yo grid
[2:40:59] <didgereedoodah> styling
[2:41:00] <%linkwolf4> oh Flexin?
[2:41:00] <kchiang3291> kuuga
[2:41:07] <%Solidnick18> hell yeah
[2:41:07] <+AllenDeadman> BB has really good art
[2:41:08] <Roasted_Pheasant> Arakune is a big puddle of gross that takes shape. I find that less weird than a shape that moves like a big puddle of gross.
[2:41:10] <gatorafan> It's not a waste of meter if it makes the style bar go higher Kappa b
[2:41:11] <Sol_Install> then the gameplay for each character is fun
[2:41:12] <+AllenDeadman> specially Central Fiction
[2:41:32] <+theunforgivingsquid> @roasted_pheasant lol
[2:41:33] <+ALTRNico> GRIM REAPAH
[2:41:35] <DrBeefcastle> man he's just doin the goofy combos to flex lmao
[2:41:35] <+NarcissistCactus> grim reaper
[2:41:36] <%Solidnick18> GRIM REPAHHH
[2:41:36] <+TheIntellectional> weirdly I think the weirdest fighting game characters are in pokken
[2:41:37] <DrBeefcastle> the disprespect
[2:41:37] <Gonewiththevoid> im a giant nerd so what drew me into blazblue was the fact it had a real vn story mode
[2:41:38] <haisho> death by GURIMU REEPPAA

[2:41:41] <+Star____> Ggs

[2:41:51] <+TheIntellectional> chandelure/suicune/etc
[2:41:51] <DrBeefcastle> that was tight
[2:42:02] <+Star____> GGs all around
[2:42:03] <KnightReis> yeah bb story might be convoluted but it has effort in it
[2:42:06] <jubejube56> spin to win as they say
[2:42:06] <ChaotixSpark> Why arent these best out of 3 though?
[2:42:08] <+theunforgivingsquid> I live the gag endings in BB
[2:42:11] <%CaptainPileDriver> when's ENKIDU
[2:42:15] <%Wool> Could y'all give TruSpindash a chance? You played him in CF and BBTag just fine. He's a 1 bar because he's also from Texas.

[2:45:25] <+theunforgivingsquid> @toynota10 I agree
[2:45:26] <%GunterDriger6> I fought her as Aki. I just wait
[2:45:26] <KnightReis> what if vergil was happy and motivated not through power
[2:45:30] <FanxService> I thought Woolie would be a Yuzu type of guy tbh
[2:45:37] <+Pyrotrooper> she's much harder to control here but has much butter rewarding feeling when learning
[2:45:43] <+NarcissistCactus> she literally does the katana stance
[2:45:48] <%Toynota10> I was just thinking I wanna try her out lol
[2:45:53] <+NarcissistCactus> you know the one
[2:45:54] <MTLxSpider> Woolie plays punch character
[2:46:01] <shryoc> Ultra weeb johnny

[2:46:05] <haisho> @FanxService He would probably, but there were punch characters
[2:46:05] <Roasted_Pheasant> Woolie is the punch girl of our dreams
[2:46:12] <MTLxSpider> pedro plays Wagner though
[2:46:13] <+NarcissistCactus> elbow
[2:46:14] <didgereedoodah> ELBOW
[2:46:14] <FanxService> huh pedro doesn't play yuzu tho
[2:46:40] <EnderGamma> 3
[2:46:42] <stormhawk9891> I'ts not the commands that are hard with Yuzu, it's the fact the you have to input them at breakneck speeds that makes her hard

[2:47:59] <Roasted_Pheasant> @didgereedoodah hey man. Crona's cool.
[2:48:04] <@Solidus_113> Soul Eater is great and it needs a remake anime
[2:48:05] <BlueVexer> @CaptainPileDriver I do. Soul Eater is still one of the coolest looking shows. Having a good quality fighting game would be sick.

[3:03:29] <InkyDraconian> feet bepis
[3:03:31] <Triplicat> 🔫
[3:03:34] <%Wool> Alice in Wonderland was the first isekai
[3:03:36] <micmic112> ...
[3:03:36] <$FuqBoiSlim> narnia is isekai
[3:03:41] <+TruSpindash> DATABASE DATABASE
[3:03:46] <kenzaki_> Aura Battler Dunbine was also an Isekai and that was from the 80s
[3:03:46] <micmic112> .hack isn't even an isekai
[3:03:47] <Roasted_Pheasant> @haisho SAO DansGame
[3:03:47] <$FuqBoiSlim> WOAAAH

[3:03:51] <micmic112> what the fuck are you talking about lmao
[3:03:53] <%CaptainPileDriver> so does anyone have a photo of reggie for...art purposes?
[3:03:55] <+smevvster> Isekais have always been bad. They've only just recently oversaturated the market to oblivion
[3:03:57] <+DukeMoose> dothack/ tried to warn us all about mmos man, THEY TRIED
[3:03:59] <micmic112> yeah he is @KnightReis
[3:04:05] <bursky00> Isekai was a thing in the 80-90's and early 2000 honestly just less defined.
[3:04:09] <micmic112> .hack is a VRMMO thing.
[3:04:11] <+AllenDeadman> lmao .hack and isekai
[3:04:13] <%linkwolf4> is MegaMan battle network an isekai?
[3:04:16] <+smevvster> Anyone remember "Those Who Hunt Elves"?
[3:04:17] <RyuuAoi> D fence
[3:04:18] <+PenmanLupine> Isekai used be called "Portal Anime" cause a lot of it involved characters falling into portals to another world instead of all of this video game inspired stuff
[3:04:20] <+theunforgivingsquid> Isekqi is my favorite genre of manga to read
[3:04:34] <RyuuAoi> yooooooo
[3:04:34] <haisho> funny how we went from portals to trucks

[3:05:04] <$FuqBoiSlim> Portal-chan to Truck-kun pknFBM

[3:05:41] <stormhawk9891> Speaking of which we need to see some Hyde's in here
[3:05:44] <+NekoNinja13> sheild hero and reincarnated as a slime are good isekai
[3:05:46] <Roasted_Pheasant> @CaptainPileDriver check out the Woolie vs channel. He's on GIFG all the time.
[3:05:48] <+DukeMoose> but kagomi is a reincarnation right?
[3:05:49] <%wolfofsound> @DukeMoose eh, that was actually that world's history
[3:05:52] <detovini> de-FEET-ed
[3:05:56] <Fujiwara_92> dot hack isn't really an Isekai tho

[3:27:28] <LandOfTheWay> PC boy here, can confirm
[3:27:29] <MTLxSpider> PC is really active
[3:27:31] <haveswordmuststing> god PC and PS4 crossplay is a must for this game
[3:27:38] <+flamoctapus> pc scene exists
[3:27:38] <EnderGamma> shout outs to Magnets
[3:27:39] <haveswordmuststing> but Sony...
[3:27:40] <KantusMonkus> better off going on the uni discord than finding ranked matches
[3:27:43] <%UrsulaCat> Jesus
[3:27:43] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Fighters on PC woolieGASM
[3:27:44] <+DeathGodSkeith> I play PC. I just happen to own this game on both becauseits that's fucking good

[3:28:14] <KantusMonkus> uni crossplay would be sick
[3:28:17] <ginei> because ps4 players are mostly wireless connections
[3:28:22] <+theunforgivingsquid> @cafefunk congrats

[0:02:34] <SheefEatsBeef> OH SHIT
[0:02:36] <SheefEatsBeef> SPARK?
[0:02:40] <+rosabellamelantha> Spark 2 is what 3D sonic should be
[0:02:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> sup
[0:03:01] <mar_krow> my twitch might be messed up
[0:03:10] <+rosabellamelantha> Spark 1 is uh
[0:03:14] <+rosabellamelantha> kinda rough
[0:03:19] <+rosabellamelantha> unsure if woolie will like it
[0:03:19] <%FuqBoiSlim> FuqBoiSlim subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! 6 months let's gooo. what do you wanna name the stream baby?

[0:03:40] <KeroKamina> God I hope he likes it
[0:03:44] <%FuqBoiSlim> havent heard that name in a long time..
[0:03:45] <KeroKamina> And thesequal
[0:03:58] <%vextalyst> oh shit son brave sword braver soul ftw
[0:04:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> the hell is spark the electric heater
[0:04:12] <%CaptainPileDriver> omg. jester.
[0:04:25] <%RioGascar> Literally never heard of this one
[0:04:33] <%FuqBoiSlim> spark the electric tester
[0:04:37] <+senro1> Helooooooo
[0:04:42] <shin_marx> sanic
[0:04:43] <KeroKamina> Really good not-sonic game with Kirby like power ups
[0:04:45] <%FuqBoiSlim> spark the electric investor
[0:04:47] <mar_krow> fixed it
[0:04:49] <+rosabellamelantha> I'm mostly just hoping woolie plays the sequel because it's a direct counter to woolie's opinion that SRB2 is where 3D sonic should have gone
[0:04:58] <+rosabellamelantha> Spark 2 is boost sonic done well
[0:05:13] <+rosabellamelantha> it's really impressive actually
[0:05:21] <KeroKamina> I’d say jester 2 is more like adventure sonic perfected
[0:05:59] <+tundraSB> woolie vs nights the hedgehog
[0:06:00] <+rosabellamelantha> I wish Sonic: Project Hero was an actual game and not just an engine
[0:06:11] <+rosabellamelantha> because project hero controls amazingly
[0:06:26] <%DesertPenguin> Get well soon Reggie!!!
[0:06:33] <+TheBigTaco> Damn, was really looking forward to doom, this should be fun though
[0:07:06] <357Sneak> SourPls
[0:07:24] <Prevot> SourPls
[0:07:29] <%RioGascar> Send reggie feet to get better
[0:08:04] <+rosabellamelantha> Honestly I'm just waiting for sega to give up and let someone else make the sonic mania of 3d sonic
[0:08:04] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:08:06] <+rosabellamelantha> please
[0:08:28] <+rosabellamelantha> the thing holding sonic back at this point is sega themselves
[0:08:33] <KeroKamina> @rosabellamelantha the creator of Spark could honestly do it
[0:08:48] <+rosabellamelantha> I'd love to see the spark guy have a proper budget
[0:09:01] <%gatorafan> What is this Woolie Vs Sonic era e live in?
[0:09:06] <KeroKamina> Spark the electric jester 2 is the best 3D sonic game I’ve played in years
[0:09:09] <+tuchpi> sbfpDattebayo sbfpDattebayo sbfpDattebayo
[0:09:57] <$legacy0117> Woolie challenges many heated topics, Sonic is one those that need to be done.
[0:09:58] <@Menitta> This was a kickstarter game, right?
[0:09:59] <1matheuw> wow i never expected woolie of all people to play this game
[0:10:07] <%gatorafan> I geniunely forgot this game had a sequel daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:10:18] <%Broand> Oh that's what that powerup was in sonic after the sequel 2
[0:10:19] <Mechazoic_Era> this mashup PogChamp
[0:10:22] <WG101> oh cool, devil shack
[0:10:24] <+rosabellamelantha> LOVE SHACK
[0:10:25] <KeroKamina> The sequel is so good if a bit short
[0:10:30] <Diablo169> ok this was the mashup i didnt know i needed. Holy fuck
[0:10:32] <%CaptainPileDriver> the battery in my laptop decided to just fucking die and no longer be recognized by my laptop, so now it runs like shit while I wait for a new battery to come in
[0:10:35] <%gatorafan> SourPls
[0:10:41] <scorpionrex6448_> Spurk
[0:10:42] <@akuda_bar> this mashup is funny it just takes so goddamn long to get to the punchline
[0:10:55] <+rosabellamelantha> The sequel is short yeah but so are most sonic games if you cut out the fluff
[0:11:06] <+rosabellamelantha> and sega is scared of that so they fill the games with bullshit fluff
[0:11:09] <+rosabellamelantha> that nobody likes
[0:11:21] <1matheuw> in a different note: this game is kinda too long
[0:11:27] <+rosabellamelantha> Spark 1 is rough
[0:11:29] <mar_krow> and i liked teppen version this mash up i want it too
[0:11:29] <%Broand> I'm subbed to both pat and woolie do I get a set bonus
[0:11:29] <%Josef_Stryker> No Doom still?
[0:11:34] <%Josef_Stryker> What's Spark?
[0:11:38] <scorpionrex6448_> a jester who got his job stolen by some robot.
[0:11:40] <1matheuw> theres a lot of stages that feel like filler
[0:11:44] <arkv01> reggie still feeling under?
[0:11:53] <scorpionrex6448_> It's a really good game!
[0:11:58] <$legacy0117> No, Sega is just trying to appease their Nintendo masters these days.
[0:12:00] <+rosabellamelantha> Spark kinda has that exact current sonic problem but in 2d
[0:12:05] <+rosabellamelantha> and I like this game
[0:12:08] <%Broand> a platform videogame dealing with growing pains a society must go through to reach post scarcity
[0:12:09] <$Invlux> on a scale from none to very, how much is this gonna make me miss Pulseman
[0:12:12] <KeroKamina> Hot takes: sonic unleashed & Black Knight were the last time a sonic game had decent story
[0:12:13] <+rosabellamelantha> it's just hampered by the fluff
[0:12:17] <%Superbro64> spark is sick. good stuff to lake feperd
[0:12:17] <1matheuw> however the transforming system is pretty cool tho
[0:12:20] <scorpionrex6448_> Spark the Electric Jester 2 is 3D
[0:12:21] <%gatorafan> I remember not really enjoying this game because it felt more like I was playing a tech demo. It's very weird with the (admittedly super cool) powerups
[0:12:23] <CyrusVGZ> So how long until Woolie and Pat get to do voicework for RWBY? Kappa
[0:12:23] <%Josef_Stryker> Ah so Woolie still isn't feeling well that sucks
[0:12:28] <%Josef_Stryker> I mean Reggie
[0:12:32] <%Josef_Stryker> Hope Reggie gets well soon
[0:12:37] <1matheuw> IT BEGINS
[0:12:39] <+FroggoPrince> i t b e g i n s
[0:12:42] <InXplotch> did reggie get the rona
[0:12:43] <$legacy0117> If they didn't have to deal with that, their potential would be so much better.
[0:12:44] <%FuqBoiSlim> @kerokamina I dont know many people that'd disagree with that take tbh
[0:12:48] <arkv01> might have to give reggie a 3 week isolation period just in case

[0:15:34] <+rosabellamelantha> Freedom planet is the best yeah
[0:15:41] <KeroKamina> The best 2D one maybe
[0:15:45] <+rosabellamelantha> no freedom planet is great
[0:15:49] <SheefEatsBeef> yup
[0:15:52] <+ArtemisCroc> freedom planet is great and the sequel looks solid

[0:16:12] <%JustYudha> Freedom Plant gives me some creepy furry vibes
[0:16:17] <%gatorafan> Freedom Planet is super cool, I just get irrationally butthurt at people calling it Sonic because it doesn't play like classic Sonic.

[0:16:55] <$legacy0117> I completely forgot about it, I need to buy Freedom Planet. Gonna go do that.
[0:16:56] <1matheuw> i mean the only semblance of sonic in this game is the fact that the protagonist is kinda fast
[0:16:57] <%Superbro64> @gatorafan I suppose it plays like sonic advance I guess? The wide screen view freedom planet gets is not really not like sonic
[0:17:02] <%CaptainPileDriver> Gotta use my ps4 to stream cause laptop battery quit living and is no longer recognized by by my laptop
[0:17:14] <InXplotch> When is woolie gonna play a REAL sonic game, like sonic 06
[0:17:14] <%tearfuldevil> i think the sisters of battle are lame, because they're edgy nuns with boobplate

[0:24:55] <%ChoculaUltra> actually attended a Zoom wedding the other day. Life is fucking weird man.
[0:24:56] <%arcielardor> cheer500 Hey Woolie, a few questions: have you considered virtual tabletop for future TableLords during the pandemic? Have you read Record of Ragnarok? Did you know that Sakura is now head of Ninja Mental health in Boruto?
[0:24:57] <@Menitta> Instead I'll just buy an arcade cabinet when I move.
[0:24:58] <%LeaIsChill> monkaS
[0:25:02] <the7thdraconian> Definitely want to go at some point. Maybe when I've got a stable income and my own place.
[0:25:09] <%Atomik456> they're keeping the borders closed but things are getting back to normal
[0:25:09] <arkv01> hakones great, don't go during peak summer heat

[0:26:05] <@akuda_bar> damn son
[0:26:13] <derap41> And its not fun running around spending no time doing the actual things
[0:26:16] <@Solidus_113> It's a vacation to another country, not an amusement park
[0:26:22] <@akuda_bar> he should put in something where you can spend 10,000 chat points to make your chat like... green
[0:26:23] <Nested_Dreams> tfw only 13k points
[0:26:24] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> There's an awesome onsen place near th Gundam though, totally recommend

[0:26:36] <KeroKamina> @woolieversus not sure if you will read this but very glad you’re finally looking at the spark series after Liam brought it up forever ago in the old podcast, been one of my favorite indie games. Hope you have fun
[0:26:37] <Snakes_dk> just being a japan is a great experince
[0:26:42] <Who_lio42> BURACK HOLE
[0:26:54] <arkv01> I found that if you just leave the woolievs tab alone and never close it, your points start huging
[0:26:55] <%ChoculaUltra> you guys see the progress on Japan's walking Gundam? I am fucking ready for the Newtype evolution across the populace.
[0:26:58] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> I didn't wanna spend $100 on Robot Restaurant
[0:26:58] <@Solidus_113> I have 161.4k points
[0:27:06] <derap41> That's lot of Neon

[0:28:18] <Who_lio42> does woolie kno about chocho
[0:28:20] <segbas2004> the ultimate heal girl
[0:28:28] <%nepwar> and kabuto apparently owns a orphanage
[0:28:30] <@Menitta> woolieLORE_FC
[0:28:36] <$legacy0117> Hey if Japan builds actual Mobile Suits maybe they'll be able to survive if DOOM Eternal actually happens.
[0:28:38] <@Menitta> oh yeah
[0:28:46] <derap41> And those experiements were mostly useless
[0:28:46] <arkv01> yeah so orochimaru is the unit 731 of the bortverse
[0:28:53] <Snakes_dk> hes a cool guy though
[0:29:22] <%ChoculaUltra> Orochimaru's son seems p chill. Sure would hope he's not part of some long game sleeper agent plot.
[0:29:22] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:29:31] <arkv01> yeah that's a titanic scheduling ordeal
[0:29:38] <%Atomik456> i mean Orochimaru was kind of one oof the big reasons they won the final fight with Mads and Kags, so like getting repaid with being allowed too live under supervision is kind oooof fair i guess?
[0:29:43] <brunoberserk> woolie , you already played SHADES of Manhattan 3 ?
[0:29:43] <@akuda_bar> woolieMIRIN_TK
[0:29:55] <%mitchteck> Uno works pretty well on tts

[0:31:02] <%waterbuddy16> holla for sketchy at home gyms lol
[0:31:16] <derap41> Walking is still allowed
[0:31:17] <arkv01> well shit I've been neglecting cardio for 3 months
[0:31:26] <%FusRoDom> Just spar with punchmom
[0:31:28] <treacherously_> I had the best curry katsu of my life in hakone
[0:31:28] <YakumoYomi> I've been doing Ring Fit Adventure for workouts. It certainly won't replace a gym, but it will keep your stamina/endurance up.
[0:31:28] <@Menitta> woolieGASM_BT this is a good one
[0:31:29] <%paladinstarbuster> for the record having mental health issues doesnt preclude you from working in the field in fact many professionals got int it because of that. it even comes up in class
[0:31:32] <worldbrand> thats probably most people, i mean at 7000 calories per kg it's pretty tough
[0:31:34] <derap41> Diet is 90% of weight loss
[0:31:36] <@akuda_bar> @Menitta SIPP
[0:31:40] <TheGershon> literally started going back to the gym the day before quarantine
[0:31:44] <TheGershon> rip
[0:31:49] <%ChoculaUltra> luckily my neighborhood's a ghost town as of the pandemic. Going out for runs have evoked I Am Legend type feels tbh LUL
[0:31:56] <CyrusVGZ> @paladinstarbuster Agreed
[0:32:19] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I actually just bought a bike to keep in shape
[0:32:21] <@akuda_bar> hitting your own recording button like some kind of plebian
[0:32:21] <arkv01> yeyeye quality solo time with poppa wump!
[0:32:24] <%arcielardor> @woolieversus read Record of Ragnarok. it's a Kumate of 13 gods vs 13 humans. it's got the Bible's Adam in a fist fight with Zeus!!
[0:32:34] <SpodFish> WOOLIE TIME
[0:32:40] <the7thdraconian> I'm nervous cause people seem really eager to start throwing parties at the lake again and I'm worried we're gonna see an uptick in cases cause of that.
[0:32:40] <%Solidnick18> solo woolz
[0:32:45] <mussyplussy> You ready for Sonic Kirby, eh Woolie?

[0:33:04] <SpodFish> 2nd wave is gonna be rough with everyone getting lit rn
[0:33:10] <$legacy0117> Adam is literally a regular arse human.
[0:33:15] <%ChoculaUltra> @the7thdraconian while I'm all for the return of "regular" life, having lake parties seems like a red flag rn
[0:33:15] <%LeaIsChill> Xenoblade Chronciles Definitive tomorrow, who's on that?
[0:33:20] <%nepwar> Woolie woolieVS : Handicapped Mode
[0:33:24] <%Atomik456> oh shit

[0:34:04] <YakumoYomi> @the7thdraconian That's unfortunately already happened here in North Carolina. "2nd Phase" of reopenings happened last Friday...and our state saw the most new COVID cases in a single day happen the very next day.
[0:34:07] <%pectusumbra> okay, what are we looking at here?
[0:34:10] <%SomersaultJustice> this not snes controller
[0:34:10] <KeroKamina> @leaischill I’m excited, I love all the Xenoblade games
[0:34:11] <CyrusVGZ> I don't really know if I want XBC. I really liked XBC2 but XBC is nothing like that from what I've seen.
[0:34:14] <Mechazoic_Era> SourPls
[0:34:17] <SpodFish> No fix is know 👀
[0:34:18] <the7thdraconian> Waiting for my birthday. Still got a bunch of other games to focus on.
[0:34:20] <WG101> listen to this sonic-ass music
[0:34:22] <$legacy0117> If you said Sampson, that would make more sense.
[0:34:28] <the7thdraconian> That and I still need to finish XB X
[0:34:29] <treacherously_> I don’t understand the people who are so eager to do things like go to a water park
[0:34:29] <@akuda_bar> spark the electric jesus*

[0:34:44] <+Chazmosis> It's the same team that worked on Sonic Before and After the Sequel
[0:34:45] <DragonArt07> is this based off of Nights, he looks like a jester

[0:35:26] <%FuqBoiSlim> TwitchUnity
[0:35:31] <YakumoYomi> @CyrusVGZ The underlying gameplay is largely the same. I'd say that XC is better than XC2 because it doesn't go as hard with the shonen anime tropes and you don't have to deal with gacha bullshit of Blade cores/field skills.

[0:39:35] <TomosukeUsagi> Grim dark future, mmmk
[0:39:39] <TheRickyWill> A tiny heads up as someone who’s played the game since launch- For some bizzare reason there was a patch that rewrote the entire story into something slightly more weird and slightly more dense, with no real way to revert it. For example, this intro was originally MUCH shorter
[0:39:39] <%gatorafan> You think the author is trying to tell us something?
[0:39:45] <CyrusVGZ> Woolie and the boys should play a Gaunlet game whenever possible. Specifically Gauntlet Dark Legacy for Gamecube/Xbox.
[0:39:47] <SkyOceanGames> chuck noris is trying to teach me kungfu because of a sandwich
[0:39:48] <the7thdraconian> David Cage was Right!
[0:39:48] <@Menitta> "I got a degree in Electrical Engineering. I'll be fine." "Welcome to Baskin Robins"
[0:39:49] <Nope80808> What what Andrew is up to now
[0:39:52] <YakumoYomi> @Prevot But Woolie could just become a vTuber too!
[0:39:52] <%nepwar> thats why i keep saying he need to stat advancing cyber implants

[0:40:04] <$legacy0117> Okay not so Nightz. Too real.
[0:40:04] <Vyneci> BTW, the story was rewritten a while back and it removed some fun lines like Spark being pissed about being awake for a whole day straight
[0:40:05] <%ChoculaUltra> so he became a cam girl?!
[0:40:08] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[0:40:09] <%ChoculaUltra> life is fucking rough man.

[0:45:25] <%jiggy_snipe> so this is the Kirby right?
[0:45:26] <$legacy0117> Nah, Sparks lives in buildings at least. Sonic lives in dug out holes and collects trashed furniture and leftover COMIC books, at least according to more recent Sonic series...Not the SatAM or the comics however.
[0:45:28] <arkv01> surely we'll encounter a creepy old scientist that grooms us with power ups and makes us call him daddy?
[0:45:28] <1matheuw> its a space jump

[0:46:04] <petwisk> Surprised to see someone giving Spark Some love
[0:46:13] <the7thdraconian> It's like the Megaman 0 to Sonic's Megaman X.
[0:46:17] <arkv01> visually this game is a banger
[0:46:22] <KeroKamina> More than our default
[0:46:23] <mussyplussy> And there is a stock that you can switch from, I know Woolie isn't reading this but this comment is for the chat

[0:46:51] <Nested_Dreams> Hey, it looks pretty readable. Doesn't go blurry on my eyes
[0:47:05] <$legacy0117> This character is very fighty compared to Sonic, I like it. ^^
[0:47:11] <petwisk> suggest Edgy powerup
[0:47:15] <mussyplussy> @nepwar The stock is your powerup, I probably should've worded it better, you can see it behind Woolie
[0:47:18] <the7thdraconian> Always had a hard time with the open levels of sonic. Always made me feel like I missed something.

[0:58:10] <Vyneci> Your stock is in the lower left Woolie
[0:58:11] <cinosgaming> don't ask, the pause menu is a mess

[0:58:18] <InXplotch> yeah, anyone can be a vtube
[0:58:28] <SkyOceanGames> my job is to build robots. and the first robot i built just built other robots, so now i serve squishi's at 7-11
[0:58:31] <Monkey_D_Judd> Woolie should become a Vtuber, he could call himself the first N-tuber.

[1:09:19] <@akuda_bar> WALK INTO MY MYSTERY
[1:09:27] <@Menitta> STEP INSIDE AND HOLD ON FOR DEAR LIFE
[1:09:30] <Vyneci> He gets a fucking Chaos Blast with a full bar
[1:09:41] <%powerprotoman> and a drop dash too
[1:09:48] <@Solidus_113> you really have to test your levels with a power like this
[1:09:48] <$legacy0117> Pickaxes mode back there!
[1:10:01] <TheGershon> haven't seen a slow loop like that since 06
[1:10:02] <$legacy0117> So, 9 in total now
[1:10:05] <%FuqBoiSlim> does this dude have 8 way dashes like hes Magneto or something? woolieREMEMBERS
[1:10:10] <+fetrigon> I also love that the enemies in this game don't do touch damage unless it makes sense.
[1:10:15] <+ALazo> test it
[1:10:26] <KeroKamina> He will just look like he’s drowning
[1:10:34] <megamonmon123> does spark have a katana sword?
[1:10:39] <%arcielardor> DARKNESS
[1:10:40] <SkyOceanGames> lets make it a fish and have it under water
[1:10:45] <@akuda_bar> IMPRISONING ME
[1:10:47] <%arcielardor> NO PARENTS
[1:10:53] <%lewdskeletor13> ALL THAT I SEE
[1:10:56] <+SaltySombrero> Enemies not having contact damage kinda makes sense for a speedy game, and i'm surprised this game is the one to address it
[1:11:04] <+Ixiah> He doesnt know LUL
[1:11:15] <$jobbedbone> sparks dont need to breathe
[1:11:15] <%lewdskeletor13> Is this one of those Sanic games I’ve hear so much about
[1:11:17] <Vyneci> Little nice detail, your eletric attacks have increased range underwater
[1:11:20] <%alephalpha> efreedom planet gets by
[1:11:25] <+Ixiah> cant he ?
[1:11:28] <$legacy0117> You are also underwater, so electricity is probably more effective.
[1:11:31] <+Ixiah> xD
[1:11:34] <%BackwardCap> CQC
[1:11:39] <shurtal> boots and a headband?
[1:11:39] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1265145307408539648

[1:12:18] <andrei11dr> Now you're Blaziken
[1:12:25] <%lewdskeletor13> Did Satan finally get to Reggie
[1:12:26] <%Double_Tap_That> Divekick
[1:12:27] <%Double_Tap_That> ?
[1:12:29] <Vyneci> I think it's keep mashing for blue attacks
[1:12:44] <mussyplussy> It's the Maximum Heat Knuckles
[1:12:52] <anita_dickin> do comno
[1:12:53] <KeroKamina> @legacy0117 there’s also an ice and surfboard power
[1:12:53] <SkyOceanGames> walk on all surfaces but no jump
[1:12:55] <anita_dickin> combo
[1:12:59] <eldragon_1> become Azula
[1:13:10] <%lewdskeletor13> Are these solo streams gonna go up on the channel?
[1:13:15] <@Solidus_113> yes
[1:13:34] <%lewdskeletor13> woolieGASM
[1:13:40] <%Damie904> Switch to Edge and wall walk?
[1:13:45] <%Damie904> Oh nvm
[1:13:50] <KeroKamina> It was just edgy again iirc
[1:14:00] <TheGershon> This is one of those games where you can just never stop dashing
[1:14:05] <%alephalpha> LIES
[1:14:07] <cinosgaming> you can wall climb with edgy!
[1:14:07] <SkyOceanGames> the pope just branded harley
[1:14:09] <cinosgaming> oof
[1:14:11] <%powerprotoman> should ahve kept edgy
[1:14:12] <@Solidus_113> fake wall?
[1:14:16] <%alephalpha> no longer edgy though
[1:14:21] <cinosgaming> yeah that
[1:14:30] <$legacy0117> Electric, Wind, Fire, Mage, Knight, Edgy, Sword, Hammer. So 8 combat forms, unless I missed a couple.
[1:14:33] <SkyOceanGames> get your christian brand of crome
[1:14:37] <%kyh9> Can you switch mid-combo
[1:14:41] <+fetrigon> @skyoceangames EXPLAIN
[1:14:46] <%alephalpha> how fast is switching woolie?
[1:14:47] <1matheuw> arow lets you fly
[1:14:53] <+fetrigon> Don't leave me hanging
[1:14:55] <SkyOceanGames> @fetrigon i'm insane
[1:14:58] <%FuqBoiSlim> wheres royal guard 4Head
[1:15:01] <mussyplussy> @alephalpha It's instant
[1:15:13] <$legacy0117> Fire damage is very high.
[1:15:14] <%alephalpha> so you can cancelw heneve that sound sgreat
[1:15:23] <SkyOceanGames> a invisibility ability that locks out your other abilities
[1:15:32] <%Arek_1> It looks like you need more than just the top half of the sprite on the wall to stick to the wall, no?
[1:16:13] <@Solidus_113> hp
[1:16:23] <SkyOceanGames> this has got some cool sonic speed
[1:16:31] <%BackwardCap> *Has shield, dies to frontal attack anyway*
[1:17:05] <SkyOceanGames> a super attack that gives you a damage hit, taking away the ability
[1:17:19] <ChrisM341> Is this Kirby the MegaHog?
[1:17:31] <plushysceptile> No chance to play the Freedom Planet 2 demo?
[1:17:33] <KeroKamina> The second to last level is probably the best song in the game
[1:17:42] <+Yomigami> Blaze is at it again
[1:17:43] <Wight_Trash> Not a fan of the character design, but everything else is very cool
[1:17:49] <SkyOceanGames> 3 playtesters
[1:18:16] <biomegabear> I like edgy for running on the walls in vertical levels
[1:18:24] <@Solidus_113> ez
[1:18:29] <the7thdraconian> Somewhere, Matt goes, "I think I'm gonna have to kick Woolies butt next time I see him."
[1:18:30] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:18:30] <mussyplussy> Ah dropkicking
[1:18:37] <KeroKamina> Enemy step
[1:18:47] <the7thdraconian> Scrooge Mcduck that fucker.

[1:23:21] <%saladin1911> Hayfever is beating the shit outta me but besides that, I'm great.
[1:23:21] <megamonmon123> too black. wrapped in black, too steong
[1:23:25] <LaikaCDP> that zoom
[1:23:27] <TheGershon> it's more like advance 2, both made by dimps however
[1:23:32] <megamonmon123> wrapped in black in black in black
[1:23:32] <SkyOceanGames> how many systems we got?
[1:23:43] <%alephalpha> what happens when you switch wepaons here?

[1:24:09] <biomegabear> its like 2d sonic, kirbt and gunstar heroes
[1:24:19] <the7thdraconian> Waiting for my pancake batter to rise so I can have pancakes while watching Woolie Stream.
[1:24:22] <$legacy0117> Great...Oh shit an actual Jet.
[1:24:35] <$legacy0117> Nice. ^^
[1:24:41] <tetrabrick1lt> @the7thdraconian pancake gang
[1:24:44] <Vyneci> Time for some chill ass jams SourPls
[1:25:09] <megamonmon123> is this going on youtube woolz?
[1:25:13] <%FuqBoiSlim> why do the water levels always babe the chill music
[1:25:18] <@Solidus_113> all streams go on YouTube
[1:25:22] <the7thdraconian> @tetrabrick1lt Hell yeah!
[1:25:29] <$legacy0117> Should keep the board, it brings you to th he water's surface...Nvm.
[1:25:30] <%pectusumbra> because water is relaxing
[1:25:38] <ChrisM341> Almost every game has a sewer/water level
[1:25:40] <biomegabear> virgil time
[1:25:48] <LaikaCDP> this music is sick
[1:25:49] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:25:54] <%Superbro64> SourPls
[1:25:58] <$jobbedbone> sparks dont need oxygen
[1:26:04] <megamonmon123> @solidus_113 oh cool thank you
[1:26:13] <KeroKamina> Infinite jump in watch tubes
[1:26:31] <SkyOceanGames> water jump
[1:26:33] <Vyneci> You need to be underwater
[1:27:03] <megamonmon123> makes sense
[1:27:04] <KeroKamina> Because electricity
[1:27:19] <@Solidus_113> don't have infinite jumps in water?
[1:27:22] <$jobbedbone> acktuwally,
[1:27:28] <KeroKamina> Full LP?
[1:27:44] <$legacy0117> Lucky there isn't an oxygen requirement.
[1:27:56] <%FuqBoiSlim> depends on how long the game is
[1:27:57] <megamonmon123> so this game is kirby + sonic
[1:28:02] <megamonmon123> best of both worlds?
[1:28:07] <@Solidus_113> and megaman X
[1:28:12] <unclekulikov> I like the music.
[1:28:21] <megamonmon123> ah okay
[1:28:30] <%Superbro64> gunstar heroes
[1:28:36] <mussyplussy> I believe there's 16 stages, each having an A and B part, that aare around 10 minutes each
[1:28:37] <ChrisM341> 90s the game
[1:28:42] <$legacy0117> It is a very good combination of those three.
[1:28:46] <mistermastergreg> R I S T A R
[1:28:49] <%FuqBoiSlim> game is pretty generous with the health pick ups huh
[1:29:06] <+FadingFrost> no rings
[1:29:10] <$legacy0117> AND this is only ONE character story.
[1:29:30] <SkyOceanGames> the invisible ghost
[1:29:44] <the7thdraconian> Defiinitely fixes a huge problem with the Sonic games in general.
[1:29:51] <$legacy0117> One of like, 7 character stories.
[1:30:01] <%glass_marcus> Good. Touch damage sucks
[1:30:07] <biomegabear> @legacy0117 theres 2
[1:30:09] <SkyOceanGames> depression the dating sim
[1:30:13] <%BackwardCap> I find damage on contact platform games to be a very outdated design.
[1:30:25] <megamonmon123> oh you have a pogo jump as well
[1:30:39] <SkyOceanGames> select things that you want to say to the terapist for mental health points and then go through a day at school
[1:30:43] <the7thdraconian> It works in Shovel Knight, but definitely not in a game like Sonic. @BackwardCap
[1:31:05] <the7thdraconian> Oh no!
[1:31:13] <mussyplussy> Ooh, clutch
[1:31:14] <megamonmon123> clutch
[1:31:16] <+Typhaeon> Very nice
[1:31:19] <the7thdraconian> HUZZAH!
[1:31:21] <$legacy0117> Good luck! YEAH.
[1:31:24] <%FuqBoiSlim> clutched
[1:31:26] <+l3sovikk> This more like Megaman or Sonic?
[1:31:26] <%Solidnick18> SourPls
[1:31:32] <megamonmon123> woolie of all people should believe in the power of the blade
[1:31:33] <$legacy0117> Brb.
[1:31:37] <Vyneci> You can turn off "dashing by double tapping" in the options BTW
[1:31:53] <%trustycoyote> @legacy0117 So said that there are multiple characters in this game or just the one?
[1:32:13] <+Can_Do_Kamel> Hi woolie will you try the 3D sequel to this game? It’s meant to be like Sonic Adventure
[1:32:13] <+Star_Joe_Streams> Freedom Planet vibes
[1:32:15] <Vyneci> There are two characters
[1:32:26] <mussyplussy> Yeah there's a mode where you play the faker
[1:32:37] <mussyplussy> I'm not saying his name until it's revealed in game
[1:32:50] <1matheuw> wise choice
[1:32:50] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:33:04] <%trustycoyote> Interesting @mussyplussy @Vyneci
[1:33:09] <BlueFusionVolt> lytMOTIVATED
[1:33:11] <KeroKamina> You have the parry dodge by default, it doesn’t matter what power up you have
[1:33:11] <%chiluzza> the after image really
[1:33:13] <+yoush03> !MOTIVATED
[1:33:13] <@Moobot> 1192 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[1:33:16] <%alephalpha> theirs a lot of distorion efefcts
[1:33:17] <SkyOceanGames> the snes might not be able to hold all the abilities with the speed
[1:33:23] <terribleusername> all those effects, yeah
[1:33:24] <biomegabear> sprite quality?
[1:33:29] <megamonmon123> the sound?
[1:33:30] <andrei11dr> The music definitely
[1:33:34] <%trustycoyote> Possibly the water visual effect
[1:33:37] <KeroKamina> The animations in the background for one
[1:33:39] <bravedjohnny> hey woolz, did you play khimera destroy all monster girls? its free to play on steam, its a really good platformer
[1:33:43] <%PulsinFufu> inochiThink the combination of sprites animations and frames
[1:33:45] <%alephalpha> water efefcts are definitely way out of scope
[1:33:46] <%powerprotoman> id rather they go with games as we rememebr them instead of as they were
[1:33:48] <KeroKamina> And the type of tracks in the soundtrack
[1:33:53] <mussyplussy> or Plok
[1:33:56] <DedlokPM> I am guessing Reggie couldn't come in so woolie is playing a game woolieFUN ?
[1:34:08] <wunderkindest> Even SNES Killer Instinct
[1:34:11] <Novillion> want this planned to be released on a real snes cartridge?
[1:34:12] <megamonmon123> are water levels more or less hated than sewer levels?
[1:34:16] <+Typhaeon> Rare had so many great composers
[1:34:18] <andrei11dr> Genesis didn't sound like this
[1:34:19] <SkyOceanGames> i love the 3d animation on snes. donkey kong and mario rpg
[1:34:28] <the7thdraconian> Always interesting to see what people do when updating classic formulas, but with modern twists.
[1:34:34] <+TheOneCalledRock> fuck tim follin
[1:34:37] <+Typhaeon> Yeah it would need a lot more bass synths to be Genesis
[1:34:37] <+TheOneCalledRock> nuff said
[1:34:38] <AnneSQF> those fans in the bg are a bit distracting, dont you think?
[1:34:42] <+TheOneCalledRock> fucking*
[1:34:51] <TheGershon> the super Nintendo can pretty much do any sound you want, it's just a matter of fitting it all onto a cart
[1:34:55] <Nope80808> Altered beast had some real great music
[1:34:59] <the7thdraconian> Shovel Knight is full of so many little touches that make it play like how you remember NES games played.
[1:35:10] <megamonmon123> i think I hate water levels more than sewer ones
[1:35:15] <KeroKamina> The little yellow bar revives you on the spot when it’s full btw
[1:35:18] <+Typhaeon> In a weird way I think the SNES sound chip was a little sterile compared to Genesis, even though Sega's was obviously a lot more limited
[1:35:18] <%Superbro64> ah yes, the classic "third sonic level" problem Kappa
[1:35:30] <mussyplussy> Sweet sword battle
[1:35:32] <andrei11dr> Later SNES started to get on this level, but even than, the actual sound quality wasn't this good
[1:35:45] <%paladinstarbuster> The bosses in this game are kinda ass looking
[1:35:47] <biomegabear> learned and lived
[1:36:02] <+Loinclothiclese> @paladinstarbuster kinda? cmonBruh
[1:36:17] <@Solidus_113> no HP

[1:36:39] <mistermastergreg> woolie did it

[1:36:42] <%Superbro64> committed hara kiri Kapps
[1:36:47] <%Superbro64> BibleThump
[1:36:57] <+Loinclothiclese> why? @paladinstarbuster they look like ass
[1:37:08] <+Typhaeon> Some pretty long levels in this game
[1:37:08] <bravedjohnny> you didnt kill him, he killed himself Kappa

[1:37:52] <%paladinstarbuster> @Loinclothiclese because i dont know the context in which these assets or game was created
[1:38:00] <theanora1> that's some sonic runways if I ever saw em

[1:38:34] <%Superbro64> you can blast in the left direction for more speed
[1:38:58] <andrei11dr> Well, we had robots but no VR
[1:39:03] <the7thdraconian> And I'm back
[1:39:10] <megamonmon123> woolie with the life lessons
[1:39:21] <biomegabear> so my only complain with the game is the levels might be a bit to long on my first playthrough but I think on multiple playthroughs that might be the point to find a fast route
[1:39:25] <@Solidus_113> Buffering Ads LUL
[1:39:41] <terribleusername> too fast LUL
[1:39:59] <Shock_Toaster> you should be fine, you built up enough of the meter for a second chance
[1:40:00] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1265145307408539648
[1:40:34] <%Superbro64> are you holding right through loops, or is your rotating your controls with the loop?
[1:40:42] <Vyneci> HOLY SHIT
[1:40:45] <%BackwardCap> 1st form?
[1:40:47] <%Superbro64> something weird with how that works might explain the spees drop?
[1:40:54] <@Solidus_113> NICE
[1:40:54] <daisyyyy> KILLDOZER
[1:41:02] <SkyOceanGames> remember castilvania 2? i just ordered odin sphere
[1:41:27] <Shock_Toaster> bat os my fav ability in this game, wish it was in the sequel
[1:41:36] <%pectusumbra> the last minecart before the boss, yeah
[1:41:38] <$legacy0117> Bosses have combat form Megaman weaknesses it looks like. Keep that in mind Woolie!
[1:41:46] <%pectusumbra> with all the birds on the screen and the game slows down yeyeyeyee'
[1:41:55] <SkyOceanGames> what would x2's fire dash do jumping off a mine cart
[1:42:06] <+Omgbasedjay> It’s like ristar and sonic had a aunt and uncle that me fell in love and had a baby @woolieversus
[1:42:06] <Daxalog> "intended"
[1:42:25] <Shock_Toaster> is that gravity?
[1:42:25] <1matheuw> new power
[1:42:30] <vstpnv> when you cut 7 dudes in one hit in No More Heroes and framerate drops to 10fps
[1:42:30] <Vyneci> You haven't
[1:42:32] <%pectusumbra> I mean they clearly tested that, saw it did slowdown, then went 'fuck it, that's rad'
[1:42:32] <mussyplussy> I think that's Gravity
[1:42:32] <%trustycoyote> I love when emulators give you the option to keep the hardware limitations
[1:42:33] <%Superbro64> thats new
[1:42:52] <KeroKamina> No you didn’t get that before
[1:43:02] <+Loinclothiclese> @trustycoyote sometimes i just love the jaggys and the way a game looked its always awesome.
[1:43:04] <@Solidus_113> We NIGHTS now
[1:43:04] <1matheuw> best power
[1:43:05] <SkyOceanGames> what!
[1:43:07] <+Typhaeon> You're Magneto now

[1:43:12] <%paladinstarbuster> KHIGHTSU
[1:43:13] <%powerprotoman> the msot broken power in the game
[1:43:14] <Vyneci> Gravity is full movement but not great in combat
[1:43:16] <%chiluzza> yo thats cool
[1:43:17] <%powerprotoman> Nights mode
[1:43:17] <mussyplussy> Rarest power in the game FYI
[1:43:19] <$legacy0117> 11 Combat forms now!
[1:43:20] <SkyOceanGames> oh that's cool
[1:43:20] <LaikaCDP> we into dreams now boys
[1:43:22] <KeroKamina> Gravity rush
[1:43:23] <SkyOceanGames> that's a game in itself
[1:43:23] <huskarl_zap> wheres reggie the hero?

[1:43:36] <Shock_Toaster> its pretty much like super sonic in advannce 3
[1:43:37] <andrei11dr> Fuckin Nights Into Dreams
[1:43:42] <Shock_Toaster> and rush
[1:43:43] <SkyOceanGames> put it on wii
[1:43:51] <Daxalog> Whats that hat on the left of that gravity hat?
[1:43:58] <%arcielardor> he looks high
[1:43:58] <357Sneak> SourPls
[1:44:01] <biomegabear> @AnneSQF you can still get hit
[1:44:03] <+aishman> What the fuck is this game?
[1:44:03] <SkyOceanGames> i have a fantasy off all the old systems comming back out and new games being released for them
[1:44:17] <%Merhabi> I cant tell if this is an old favorite or a new game, is Woolie pro at this?
[1:44:26] <daisyyyy> We Gravity Rush now
[1:44:27] <Shock_Toaster> new game ish
[1:44:29] <%FuqBoiSlim> it's new to him
[1:44:31] <%pectusumbra> this is newer, a game from 2017
[1:44:33] <Shock_Toaster> this game is like 2017
[1:44:46] <biomegabear> @WoolieVersus check out his idle animation as gravity
[1:44:53] <dukenux> nice, was about to ask how old this game is
[1:44:54] <%trustycoyote> @Loinclothiclese TOtally. That's why I love the scan line overlays. Back then they put in so much effort to make something look good by using the scanlines to smooth edges. MMX is a great example
[1:44:59] <mussyplussy> Spark 2 came out in like mid 2019
[1:44:59] <%Merhabi> okay new to him, thanks yall
[1:45:06] <+aishman> This looks like
[1:45:06] <+Typhaeon> 8-way attacks? Sick
[1:45:07] <+aishman> 2d Nights
[1:45:21] <Shock_Toaster> nights without the .5
[1:45:29] <%alephalpha> it feels kinda slow though
[1:45:31] <Daxalog> This game feels like that kinda game I would want to make if I was a kid and knew how to do anything
[1:45:46] <%FuqBoiSlim> I'll never forgive capcom for having that ugly ass smoothing filter be the default in the zero collection
[1:45:54] <Shock_Toaster> this is a slower ability due it being op in mobility
[1:46:11] <KeroKamina> Punk robot
[1:46:23] <mussyplussy> I believe there are only 10
[1:46:24] <%trustycoyote> Those guys look like the little muncher guys from TMNT.
[1:46:26] <$legacy0117> 11 powers
[1:46:31] <KeroKamina> 12
[1:46:33] <vstpnv> chat, does sequel have more or less powerups?
[1:46:36] <mussyplussy> Less
[1:46:39] <Shock_Toaster> less
[1:46:40] <mussyplussy> it has 5 iirc
[1:46:44] <SkyOceanGames> kirby superstar was one of the best games ever
[1:46:54] <SkyOceanGames> the two player was so sonic 2
[1:47:01] <KeroKamina> And we’re barely halfway done
[1:47:01] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:47:09] <Shock_Toaster> wish thi game was two player
[1:47:11] <daisyyyy> like youd think someone could have come up with a good scanline filter by now
[1:47:13] <biomegabear> green gurren on the right
[1:47:14] <Daxalog> Well atleast hes polite
[1:47:16] <%FuqBoiSlim> Milky Way Wishes is top 10
[1:47:17] <@Solidus_113> look at that gunmen
[1:47:21] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[1:47:22] <+Omgbasedjay> Kirby superstar could make superstar ultra infinity plus omega and I’ll buy it again
[1:47:29] <Daxalog> We out x20
[1:47:47] <@Solidus_113> That's literally Green Gurren
[1:48:00] <Daxalog> My god
[1:48:06] <%jiggy_snipe> this is so dumb LUL
[1:48:27] <%Merhabi> oh god
[1:48:33] <%Merhabi> it's a ganmen
[1:48:37] <%glass_marcus> this feels like sprite comic dialogue
[1:48:38] <Shock_Toaster> thats a fighting game char
[1:48:38] <biomegabear> does he throw his glasses at you
[1:48:40] <the7thdraconian> I wish we saw more hero villain interactions like this.

[1:55:47] <%paladinstarbuster> can we get this instead of hip hop chocobo?
[1:55:48] <InXplotch> since I assume he's very familiar with the game already so it would not take much mental to play

[1:57:35] <chromdad> fucking bout time we do spark. spark 2 had the best boss music of its yeat
[1:57:36] <KeroKamina> only some of them have unique idle, usually underwater
[1:57:37] <%Merhabi> outrovert

[1:59:13] <%Grayhammatter> EDGY
[1:59:17] <%0rond> oh shit there is an edgy version with a bloody knife?
[1:59:18] <%Livelinne> Is Reggie getting his well deserved rest?
[1:59:21] <$legacy0117> Whoa Gravity is such as potent form that background objects just float away. Nice.
[1:59:27] <@Solidus_113> you dash through the blue-green things
[1:59:30] <chromdad> and spark 2 is like a good 3d sonic mixed with REVENGEANCE
[1:59:30] <Shock_Toaster> edgey doesnt lose speed while going throigh loops
[1:59:54] <Shock_Toaster> as long as you hold the buttton
[1:59:58] <+Typhaeon> Welp
[1:59:58] <@Solidus_113> first death

[2:00:11] <%FuqBoiSlim> First Blood...
[2:00:15] <the7thdraconian> He just looked like he gave up on life.
[2:00:19] <KeroKamina> with a full yellow bare you could revive on the spot
[2:00:19] <mussyplussy> No you lost Bat
[2:00:22] <andrei11dr> Welp that's the first one

[2:01:57] <+noajenkk> im a big fan of this character design
[2:02:00] <+noajenkk> looks cool
[2:02:06] <+patrickng714> the people that made this did Sonic fangames didnt they?
[2:02:11] <Shock_Toaster> yeah
[2:02:23] <Shock_Toaster> they made sonic after and before the sequel
[2:02:31] <KeroKamina> @patrickng714 sonic before the sequal and sonic after the sequal
[2:02:35] <Shock_Toaster> fire
[2:02:35] <KeroKamina> that's nto edgy that's fire
[2:02:38] <+patrickng714> cool
[2:02:41] <spectra_s02> It was only one dev who made everything but the music, had about 5+ composers for music
[2:02:58] <WalkerRedd> the second one of these games looks kinda like sonic generations. Dev really seems like a sonic fan
[2:03:04] <Gieron667> so is this just kirby-sonic or what ?
[2:03:07] <DedlokPM> EDGY EDGY BISHI BISHI
[2:03:08] <%BackwardCap> Woolie: *Denies the existence of the enemy in front of them*
[2:03:09] <Shock_Toaster> both
[2:03:19] <%Merhabi> triple enemy next
[2:03:19] <mussyplussy> @Gieron667 It's a mix of Sonic, Kirby and Mega Man
[2:03:23] <%Grayhammatter> EZ
[2:03:26] <%Merhabi> yeyeye
[2:03:30] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> It's Agni and Rundra, NOT an oni
[2:03:33] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> totally
[2:03:33] <mussyplussy> Well, Mega Man X
[2:03:35] <$legacy0117> Fire does WORK.
[2:03:35] <andrei11dr> Edgy edgy edgy, breaky breaky breaky
[2:03:39] <Gieron667> and he has a hat like that one boss from kirby too
[2:03:41] <%FuqBoiSlim> X and Zero? PogChamp
[2:03:41] <Shock_Toaster> fire gets stronger the more it hits an enemy without you getting hit
[2:03:56] <dukenux> Which classic platformer this reminds you of the most, @WoolieVersus ?
[2:03:58] <$legacy0117> Sadly no more Gravity flight.
[2:03:59] <+Typhaeon> Gat crab
[2:04:37] <%FuqBoiSlim> Now the miniboss turned into a regular enemy just like an action game
[2:04:45] <Vyneci> He has Gravity in stock
[2:04:47] <Shock_Toaster> lel right
[2:04:59] <$legacy0117> Also the random blue fire is definitely a reference to when a Hadoken can spark into a red Hadoken.
[2:05:15] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> DED
[2:05:23] <dukenux> Main char reminds of NiGHTS a bit
[2:05:24] <biomegabear> can you gravity spam him
[2:05:26] <Gieron667> oh apparently there's a sequel to this game and it's a 3d sonic-like game
[2:05:28] <Shock_Toaster> its not random, thhe blue comes from using fire more and more
[2:05:59] <mussyplussy> Well that just broke the boss
[2:06:03] <$legacy0117> Oh he got flight back. ^^
[2:06:08] <%paladinstarbuster> why did the music not change for the bossfight?
[2:06:20] <Shock_Toaster> its a miniboss i believe
[2:06:41] <%pectusumbra> okay, am I stupid, or did my donation just not work at all?
[2:06:42] <dukenux> it has a lifebar
[2:06:51] <$legacy0117> Oh that's Metsl Spark btw!
[2:06:55] <Shock_Toaster> i didnt see a donation
[2:06:59] <megamonmon123> that robot with the sunglasses reminded me of scourge
[2:07:00] <$legacy0117> Metal*
[2:07:05] <WalkerRedd> its like one of those sticky hands you get in the candy machine
[2:07:07] <megamonmon123> you guys remember scourge the hedgehog
[2:07:08] <dukenux> waterbending?
[2:07:08] <LaikaCDP> wow gravity is broken
[2:07:09] <%Grayhammatter> random goo fist
[2:07:24] <KeroKamina> alot of the powers are broken
[2:07:25] <Shock_Toaster> hah, missle arent real
[2:07:36] <%FuqBoiSlim> Those were cutscene missles
[2:07:36] <+noajenkk> such cool effects in this game
[2:07:37] <Profmcsteevie> You saying Edge like that is bringing back some Catherine memories
[2:07:42] <+noajenkk> very appealing visually
[2:08:30] <dukenux> green arrow jester
[2:08:30] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1265145307408539648
[2:09:08] <$legacy0117> Ah Archer mode can stack up and save charged shots. Nice.
[2:09:19] <Vyneci> You have to jump from the rotating platform, it's weird
[2:09:21] <@Solidus_113> can't pass through a bumper
[2:09:59] <dukenux> ...yet
[2:10:07] <megamonmon123> how doesnt gravity break the game?
[2:10:10] <SkyOceanGames> talk about dmg boost
[2:10:11] <Oneyeseesin3D> thiis music tho
[2:10:16] <$legacy0117> Also it infinitely can Dash. Which is cool too.
[2:10:34] <%pectusumbra> Okay, that said donation processed. NOW it should do the go
[2:10:38] <SkyOceanGames> crzy toys
[2:11:03] <mussyplussy> @megamonmon123 Gravity is flight, it also has some good damage in its dashes in all directions
[2:11:05] <Torgue_1> Is Woolie playing this for the first time? I missed the start of the stream.
[2:11:09] <@Solidus_113> yes
[2:11:15] <+gustavozxd> how old is this game
[2:11:19] <@Solidus_113> 2017
[2:11:26] <DedlokPM> Huh. The Archer class is really made up of archers!
[2:11:28] <InXplotch> only a few years, yeah
[2:12:03] <+gustavozxd> the name sounds like its from the 90s but it does look a little too good for that
[2:12:04] <Torgue_1> Huh, I thought it was from 2015
[2:12:05] <%paladinstarbuster> Green +Archer=GARCHER
[2:12:13] <Profmcsteevie> Ah I see, explosive "clip" of sorts
[2:12:19] <Daxalog> Can you jump on the arrows that land in the wall?
[2:12:20] <cheaddos> is this on PC or SNES?
[2:12:22] <dukenux> SAVE
[2:12:26] <andrei11dr> The Jester dude looks high of his ass when he goes into Gravity mode
[2:12:55] <dukenux> do all the ferris wheel thingies serve as a medpack stations?
[2:12:56] <megamonmon123> gravity too op please nerf
[2:13:14] <derap41> Those are some Rad Goblins
[2:13:18] <$legacy0117> Nope, Archer is for agility and dodging, with a fast low damage projectile.
[2:13:19] <%Superbro64> green arrow fans BibleThump
[2:13:20] <sleepy_pixels> Hey woolie, how do tabletop games compare to videogames for you?
[2:13:21] <+gustavozxd> cool soundtrack
[2:13:26] <@Solidus_113> nothing like a good noclip
[2:13:44] <primaryfire> ios this just sonic if he could fly
[2:13:44] <$legacy0117> It probably flashsteps with it dashes.
[2:14:11] <chromdad> gravity rush 3
[2:14:21] <Daxalog> This is just Tails gameplay
[2:14:27] <dukenux> hammertime
[2:14:35] <+gustavozxd> oh so you have other cool abilities
[2:14:37] <SkyOceanGames> boss rush test
[2:14:40] <megamonmon123> yeah this is tails
[2:14:50] <chromdad> good ol fark
[2:15:05] <dukenux> "I don't understand."
[2:15:07] <Daxalog> Wow
[2:15:14] <derap41> This dialog does not match this art tone
[2:15:19] <biomegabear> dialouge is not this games strong suit
[2:15:25] <%Superbro64> with your apartment that you can't pay the rebt for.
[2:15:26] <Daxalog> Jester spittin that truth
[2:15:43] <mussyplussy> Yeah I believe this is the 1/4th of the way through boss
[2:15:43] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:15:56] <andrei11dr> Now time to kill your robot clone like in Snatcher
[2:16:10] <$legacy0117> Oh snap, Metsl Sparks was showing emotion. Interesting dynamic.
[2:16:10] <dukenux> when in doubt: gravity
[2:16:20] <%antyriku2> woah that hitbox
[2:16:22] <%paladinstarbuster> bull shit
[2:16:30] <chromdad> going all kirby in the corner wont help
[2:16:31] <Daxalog> No damage though
[2:16:45] <%Superbro64> dark souls 2 hitboxes SeriousSloth
[2:16:47] <dukenux> majeeks
[2:16:48] <KeroKamina> that is so wizard
[2:16:56] <biomegabear> shinku
[2:17:01] <dukenux> Kamehamage
[2:17:06] <+MrTAteMyBalls> not enough :O
[2:17:36] <%paladinstarbuster> gotta pop that denjin
[2:17:43] <Profmcsteevie> Oh no cooldown for my attacks, better use my infinite flight to avoid lytSMUG
[2:17:43] <dukenux> it does seem borken
[2:17:44] <+jetjagger222> GAMMA CHARGE
[2:17:50] <$legacy0117> Mage is all area of effect and range...Gravity is the extremely rare ability.
[2:17:54] <%antyriku2> ruby heart
[2:18:09] <%Superbro64> borken indeed
[2:18:20] <dukenux> its like all the other abilities give you cool superhero powers, but gravity makes you Dr Manhattan
[2:18:27] <$legacy0117> You found it by jumping into the background on that one stage.
[2:18:34] <%Superbro64> who would of thought the op one woolie would use the most is the purple one woolieF woolieU
[2:18:36] <KeroKamina> WHAT A FLEX
[2:18:38] <dukenux> GG EZ
[2:18:44] <%FuqBoiSlim> the floor is electrified NotLikeThis

[2:18:56] <KeroKamina> oh i love this cutscene
[2:18:57] <@Solidus_113> I saw the earth in the background
[2:19:08] <dukenux> D:

[2:19:17] <the7thdraconian> Not bad

[2:19:27] <357Sneak> _-__-- lytAGH
[2:19:30] <dukenux> @Superbro64 yeah, but he didn't like the green one that much
[2:19:37] <KeroKamina> I FOUND YOU, FAKER
[2:19:38] <the7thdraconian> Spark is a mood.
[2:19:44] <%FuqBoiSlim> that cutscene looks like something I'd see on new newgrounds in 2008, I love it
[2:19:45] <DedlokPM> Fark you!
[2:19:51] <redrins> whens spark 2
[2:19:56] <mussyplussy> Yep, that's your rival, Fark the Robot
[2:20:05] <dukenux> Sonic Wizard

[2:20:06] <mussyplussy> OOooooh, my favorite song in the game
[2:20:11] <LaikaCDP> goddamn this shit just keeps getting cooler
[2:20:12] <KeroKamina> i think we're 2/3rds through the game?
[2:20:14] <AxelCezar> tomatoSniff tomatoSniff
[2:20:16] <@Solidus_113> THIS BACKGROUND THO
[2:20:24] <%Ipsenscastle> This looks like NiGHTs into dreams meets Treasure Planet meets Gamemaker
[2:20:37] <mussyplussy> @KeroKamina No this is like the 1/3rd point
[2:20:40] <%powerprotoman> to eb fair gravity si the ufo of this game
[2:20:46] <KeroKamina> shit i'm forgetting alto then
[2:20:49] <biomegabear> they have better full meter ablilities
[2:20:50] <%Ipsenscastle> Wait, Treasure something? FREEDOM planet, sorry
[2:20:53] <dukenux> So is the gravity like a secret upgrade?
[2:20:54] <+jetjagger222> BGM is so saturn/psx era
[2:20:57] <%paladinstarbuster> woolie with his qa shit
[2:21:01] <$legacy0117> Gravity cannot be spammed, you have wait to use it.
[2:21:08] <%powerprotoman> woolie playing with ufo kirby "why would i sue anything else?!"
[2:21:11] <KeroKamina> i got lsot alot in this level but it should be fine
[2:21:14] <$legacy0117> Unlike most of the other powers.
[2:21:21] <Vyneci> Gravity isn't secret, just rare compared to everything else
[2:21:27] <+fetrigon> @powerprotoman LUL
[2:22:00] <+fetrigon> I was the same way playing Kirby and the amazing mirror
[2:22:10] <%Daba_mk2> his eyes are creepy

[2:22:28] <biomegabear> Gon-vitiy
[2:22:28] <dukenux> NOW THE FUN BEGINS
[2:22:29] <%Ghostbody> oop
[2:22:29] <+ALazo> Great
[2:22:29] <%jiggy_snipe> oh well
[2:22:33] <megamonmon123> F
[2:22:36] <LaikaCDP> gone now
[2:22:36] <%paladinstarbuster> GOTTA PLAY THE GAME NOW
[2:22:43] <biomegabear> thats how they balance gravity
[2:22:44] <dukenux> i knew it would happen eventually
[2:22:44] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:22:45] <%Daba_mk2> lp funsies
[2:22:45] <dukenux> F
[2:22:48] <$legacy0117> Also, you float in Gravity form 'very' slowly compared to other powers with dashing and running.
[2:22:49] <Torgue_1> F
[2:22:52] <%FuqBoiSlim> Easy Mode is no longer selectable
[2:22:53] <KeroKamina> UP THERE GOES GRAVITY -Eminem
[2:22:55] <+fetrigon> F
[2:22:55] <Profmcsteevie> Whoops, there goes gravity barbSad
[2:22:57] <dukenux> GRAVEity
[2:23:00] <Zaku_III> Gravity is best until inevitable timestop
[2:23:07] <biomegabear> gravity is also a rarer abilitie
[2:23:09] <dukenux> LUL
[2:23:16] <+ALazo> There goes my hero, watch him as he goes
[2:23:43] <dukenux> atleast the knight upgrade seems fine
[2:23:44] <%tearfuldevil> @ALazo he's a boss character
[2:23:50] <dukenux> in general
[2:24:05] <$legacy0117> So, TouHou esque bullet hell situations the Gravity mode would l ik Kelly get overwhelmed by.
[2:24:14] <$legacy0117> likely*
[2:24:17] <$jobbedbone> imaginary game mechanics?
[2:24:18] <dukenux> damn, imagine Zandatsu-lite
[2:24:48] <%tearfuldevil> can you swap midair?
[2:25:04] <%Dr_DangerPhD> the fireworks in the background on this stage are a nice touch
[2:25:28] <Profmcsteevie> We're all real ones here beuchiByrd
[2:25:29] <JohnDRadical> Was this game originally 3D or is this a sequel?
[2:25:39] <gekizenbu> the 3d one is the sequel
[2:25:52] <+fetrigon> ^
[2:25:52] <JohnDRadical> Oh. Thanks geki
[2:25:52] <mussyplussy> Spark 2 is 3D
[2:26:32] <biomegabear> sometimes unclear if something can hurt you or not
[2:26:38] <biomegabear> in terms of obsticles
[2:26:40] <+fetrigon> The backgrounds are great!
[2:27:17] <dukenux> i thought he was giving you a finger for a moment there
[2:27:32] <$legacy0117> That Computer is resistant to hammer it looks lkke.
[2:27:39] <$legacy0117> like*
[2:27:55] <%Daba_mk2> nice
[2:28:06] <$legacy0117> Nice job. ^^
[2:28:27] <%paladinstarbuster> loho deez nuts
[2:29:09] <+RealPT1> so is this some kind of kirby pulstar sonic combo?
[2:29:28] <mussyplussy> Kirby/Sonic/MMX
[2:29:57] <Profmcsteevie> He has sword arms, this poor robot can't hold his kids lytNOTIKETHIS
[2:29:57] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:30:15] <%paladinstarbuster> they do
[2:30:24] <%floralkami> ngl, I've only seen this little bit of this game so far, but it's looking far more cooler and up my alley than anything I've played in the Sonic series.
[2:30:25] <%FuqBoiSlim> Megaman and the Amazing Mirror X3 and Knuckles
[2:30:25] <$jobbedbone> !raffle
[2:30:29] <%paladinstarbuster> have resistances
[2:30:38] <$legacy0117> All powers probably work just like Megaman Woolie.
[2:30:48] <+kamig92> !uptime
[2:30:49] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 31 minutes
[2:30:59] <$legacy0117> MEGAMAN X*
[2:31:34] <+aristocroc> spark new smash dlc character?
[2:31:40] <Vyneci> Oh God the BALLS
[2:31:55] <@Solidus_113> ball pit
[2:32:17] <Vyneci> BTW board makes this level a trip
[2:32:19] <QuestionableDes> momentum is odd in this game
[2:32:45] <LaikaCDP> marx also with the similar jester hat
[2:33:00] <dukenux> NANOMACHINES
[2:33:00] <%jiggy_snipe> PogChamp
[2:33:02] <the7thdraconian> It's the fucking pick pocket
[2:33:11] <@Menitta> How neat is that
[2:33:14] <the7thdraconian> I love the dialogue in this game.
[2:33:16] <%Daba_mk2> lol
[2:33:16] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @KeroKamina
[2:33:17] <spectra_s02> Fave boss tbh
[2:33:19] <the7thdraconian> It's so casual.
[2:33:27] <dukenux> -_-
[2:33:35] <%Daba_mk2> thats cool
[2:33:37] <the7thdraconian> Reminds me of Sonic Boom
[2:33:43] <the7thdraconian> The show, not the game.
[2:33:44] <heartlesshealer> feels like old webcomics writing
[2:33:52] <357Sneak> botaniMad PowerUpR nktakuSad_SQ
[2:33:54] <$legacy0117> Unfortunately, Smash Entry is mostly based on fan demand and how much money the characters make...And holy crappp this boss is really real.
[2:33:56] <%tearfuldevil> writing isn't as good as Sonic Boom the show
[2:34:17] <@Solidus_113> this is like Warioware
[2:34:32] <%tearfuldevil> @legacy0117 on what planet do you think the fans effect smash entry do any major extent
[2:34:45] <SkyOceanGames> fan made games made fast
[2:34:50] <@Solidus_113> That TV static is going to kill the bitrate
[2:34:54] <%Daba_mk2> damn
[2:34:57] <KeroKamina> indeed
[2:35:05] <$legacy0117> This bot is the hacker responsible for all this.
[2:35:08] <%Superbro64> fangame with good gameplay, writing, level design, characters, and music are rare enough to not exist
[2:35:13] <SkyOceanGames> play them on a lets play channel with a website that allows people to download them for free
[2:35:13] <$legacy0117> Has to be.
[2:35:17] <heartlesshealer> stand beneath the jehuty form?
[2:35:30] <%Superbro64> tho to be fair, this is an original game.
[2:35:48] <+Itselguapo> dat kirb reference
[2:35:53] <%king_wragles> king_wragles subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! 
[2:35:59] <%tearfuldevil> @Superbro64 it's an "original" game
[2:36:26] <%tearfuldevil> this part of the fight is RAD
[2:36:28] <heartlesshealer> ah, the explosion is smaller than I thought
[2:36:34] <$legacy0117> Knock his feet off!
[2:36:41] <the7thdraconian> These are some well designed boss encounters, all around.
[2:36:42] <Klefth> Music was cool
[2:36:42] <%Superbro64> I imagine the righting is on par with the last sonic fangame he made
[2:36:42] <%tearfuldevil> love the star's n space ship in the background
[2:36:49] <%Superbro64> the metroidvania one
[2:36:52] <%Daba_mk2> thats cold
[2:36:59] <$legacy0117> Well. There ya go.
[2:36:59] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1265145307408539648
[2:37:00] <Vyneci> Aw yeah more chill jams SourPls
[2:37:00] <357Sneak> SourPls
[2:37:02] <KeroKamina> you're gonna loveo ne of the next levels @tearfuldevil
[2:37:03] <%FuqBoiSlim> did you get the wallet back?
[2:37:05] <dukenux> i hope he's not
[2:37:13] <dukenux> he seemed like a fun enemy
[2:37:20] <biomegabear> thrtrd s gravity in this stage
[2:37:24] <+Itselguapo> edge knight
[2:37:28] <DedlokPM> EDGY EDGY BISHI BISHI BREAKY BREAKY
[2:37:30] <@Solidus_113> SourPls
[2:37:32] <%floralkami> OH this is a Steam game??? I thought it was an old Sonic competitor since I saw some other person creating a 3D fangame for it in the style of the Sonic 3d games
[2:37:36] <$legacy0117> You also hammered in his f as ce while he layed there.
[2:37:37] <KeroKamina> this beat tho
[2:37:39] <Klefth> And music continues to be cool. Damn
[2:37:42] <$legacy0117> face*
[2:38:21] <%Superbro64> hammer just melts enemies though
[2:38:23] <%floralkami> so yeah, I'm DEFINITELY liking this a lot more than than Sonic series
[2:38:24] <mussyplussy> @floralkami That game was probably Spark 2, a game from last year
[2:38:41] <KeroKamina> Spark 2 is the 3D one yes
[2:38:44] <Vyneci> THE BEES
[2:38:58] <$legacy0117> You also fought that boss with a lance, and his last form had a lance. Probably was hid weakness.
[2:39:08] <$legacy0117> his*
[2:39:44] <%floralkami> @mussyplussy yeah, that one didn't interest me so that much cause I hate 3D Sonic mechanics like that inane lack of friction for 3D platforming...
[2:39:44] <KeroKamina> like the sonix CD fireflies
[2:39:45] <$legacy0117> Or the hammer was. It probably varies.
[2:40:13] <VectorSatyr> This entire OST is lit.
[2:40:19] <KeroKamina> @floralkami Spark 2 is worth checkign out, probably the best sonic game i've played in years not made by sonic team
[2:40:21] <Vyneci> This OST is on Spotify BTW @WoolieVersus
[2:40:22] <VectorSatyr> It only gets better from here.
[2:40:25] <%Daba_mk2> it Is pretty good
[2:40:30] <KeroKamina> oh shit nice
[2:40:42] <+Chazmosis> The composer is a dude who goes by the name Funk Fiction. Check his stuff out
[2:40:43] <ObsceneKvng> yes loving the music 🎶
[2:41:05] <Klefth> Nothing beats just buying the album/ost and poweramp
[2:41:09] <%Superbro64> there's a official youtube playlist on his channel, yes
[2:41:11] <the7thdraconian> It's got some good options for finding new music, so I like it.
[2:41:13] <VectorSatyr> To clarify what @Chazmosis said, Funk Fiction composed THIS song. There's, like, multiple composers on the OST.
[2:41:19] <unclerizla> but when you wanna listen to OK Computer on your daily commute, you cant really use yuotube
[2:41:35] <%tearfuldevil> i'm too used to pirating anything maisntream, and buying shit on bandcamp or whatever if its small dev or indie musician
[2:41:36] <+Chazmosis> @VectorSatyr You're right. My bad
[2:41:41] <%tearfuldevil> never gonna use spotify
[2:42:04] <InXplotch> spotify is so convenient though
[2:42:11] <%tearfuldevil> not relaly?
[2:42:11] <Yakjak> What's better, this or Freedom Planet?
[2:42:19] <Vyneci> Oh yeah, this is also on Bandcamp if I'm not mistaken
[2:42:29] <$legacy0117> This one has a life bar tho. So gotta kill it good.
[2:42:30] <%tearfuldevil> i have all the music i want to listen to on my phone (and comp) for whenever i want to
[2:42:30] <%Superbro64> if spotify allowed me to actually listen to things without making an account first, maybe I would have an higher opinion of it
[2:42:32] <VectorSatyr> Not gonna answer that.
[2:42:38] <%Binary_Fireball> spotify is least convenient
[2:42:46] <unclerizla> @Superbro64 its a paid service
[2:42:48] <InXplotch> I mean I have premium so iunno
[2:42:53] <%Dr_DangerPhD> spotify premium let's you stream 320 kbps audio, good if you own decent headphones
[2:42:56] <%Superbro64> its neat that tekken soundtracks are on it tho
[2:43:01] <InXplotch> I've not had issues with it ever
[2:43:03] <%Binary_Fireball> prime music is pretty decent
[2:43:28] <unclerizla> Google Play music also works fine, if you wanna give your money to a mega-corporation that is not spotify
[2:43:43] <shin_marx> Salty bet ost
[2:43:44] <$legacy0117> Hammer would've done more damage on th his probably. Lance was likely it's resistance, since it was a shelled machine.
[2:43:49] <%Binary_Fireball> I mean I already am because prime is still a fucking good deal
[2:44:01] <penitentpentwitch> A remix of a remix of a remix, as long as it sounds good
[2:44:02] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:44:02] <InXplotch> google play music is kind of a hassle sometimes from my experience, but it's probably improved since I last used it
[2:44:15] <InXplotch> I do still use it as a backup for my personal library
[2:44:23] <%Superbro64> really depends on how popular this game and its ost is in the long run
[2:44:28] <%Binary_Fireball> I don't really just listen to music though anymore which makes me sad
[2:44:29] <Profmcsteevie> We're already in the future of twice remixed soundtracks
[2:44:30] <dukenux> it's hip Kappa
[2:44:36] <%Binary_Fireball> unless im working
[2:44:38] <unclerizla> @Binary_Fireball hate giving my money to Bezos, but damn if he doesnt have a lot of stuff I want
[2:44:42] <%Superbro64> sonic bts and ats had some GLORIOUS remixes from their games
[2:44:51] <dukenux> ohey, green arrow guy
[2:45:30] <%shry2049> !uptime
[2:45:30] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 45 minutes
[2:45:32] <dukenux> is there a bonus if you fight this guys with abilities that mirror theirs
[2:45:38] <$legacy0117> Archer mode vs Knight mode. Easy victory.
[2:45:44] <VectorSatyr> @dukenux No.
[2:45:52] <KeroKamina> the onyl ability we haven't seen you use yet is Ice
[2:46:12] <strifer413> magic too I think
[2:46:14] <VectorSatyr> @KeroKamina Was Magic used?
[2:46:22] <$legacy0117> And now he's an Archer? Well th err re ya go.
[2:46:27] <@Solidus_113> Start of game: "oh man all these abilities are cool and useful" Now: Gravity or nothing else
[2:46:29] <%Superbro64> "shoot that motherf-!"
[2:46:29] <$legacy0117> there*
[2:46:30] <dukenux> he picked magic before
[2:46:36] <KeroKamina> wait as in mage magic or the oen wiht hte wand? @VectorSatyr
[2:46:38] <andrei11dr> We saw magic
[2:46:43] <KeroKamina> becasue the oen with the wand wasn't used yet
[2:46:46] <VectorSatyr> Wand.
[2:46:47] <dukenux> we saw a wizard hat one
[2:46:54] <dukenux> the blue one
[2:46:58] <andrei11dr> I think we saw 10 of them
[2:47:10] <VectorSatyr> Can't wait to see him use that one.
[2:47:15] <KeroKamina> wand wasn't used yet
[2:47:26] <KeroKamina> so yeah we havne't seen wand and ice
[2:47:47] <strifer413> I don't remember much from this game except that there was an absolutely insane skateboard level up ahead
[2:47:52] <Klefth> enbMusic enbMusic enbMusic
[2:48:04] <andrei11dr> Wizard is the Hadoken one right?
[2:48:06] <VectorSatyr> More like Sandboarding.
[2:48:10] <%Superbro64> is this the level with the maze?
[2:48:10] <Vyneci> I think that's the next level
[2:48:20] <VectorSatyr> @Superbro64 No.
[2:48:45] <$legacy0117> Archer mod ed is likely effective as against 'Beast-like' or Edgey type enemies.
[2:48:52] <$legacy0117> mode*
[2:49:25] <$legacy0117> There is probably a list of all the matchups.
[2:49:47] <$legacy0117> Power matchups*
[2:50:05] <$Invlux> Jebaited
[2:50:09] <biomegabear> level design seems strange when its not being sonic-like
[2:50:17] <strifer413> I hope Woolie ends up playing Spark 2. While not as polished as this one, it's a great 3d sonic which is rare
[2:50:26] <%Superbro64> Jebaited
[2:51:13] <%Binary_Fireball> haaaat
[2:51:13] <%Superbro64> If only we had an ability, that allows us to move through the stage freely, in the air.. Kappa
[2:51:13] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:51:17] <dukenux> face it
[2:51:19] <%jiggy_snipe> no gravity for you
[2:51:22] <%Binary_Fireball> because hats are coool
[2:51:24] <dukenux> nothing will live up to gravity
[2:51:29] <KeroKamina> oh god i don't think this is good for this boss
[2:51:35] <@Solidus_113> yoooo
[2:51:37] <%Daba_mk2> yooo
[2:51:40] <$legacy0117> Edgy, Mage, Archer. Not good. choices.
[2:51:47] <spectra_s02> Second best boss lets gooooooo
[2:51:49] <dukenux> look at that EVA in the bg
[2:51:57] <biomegabear> yeah
[2:52:26] <@Solidus_113> Satsuki Kiryuin is at the top of that tower
[2:52:27] <Vyneci> Try to build a full bar and then use the charge beam with mage
[2:52:39] <%Superbro64> Lake feperd in an interview did state that he made more inspiration then the obvious when making this game
[2:52:52] <%Superbro64> *had
[2:53:03] <strifer413> Satsuki's godrays are still just the best thing ever
[2:53:27] <spectra_s02> fun fact, this boss was made with a 3D model

[2:53:50] <spectra_s02> You can see it in the Spark artbook, which surprisingly has more lore in it
[2:53:54] <%FuqBoiSlim> F
[2:54:02] <dukenux> "Let's call it a draw"
[2:54:50] <1matheuw> oh shit is woolie gonna finish the game?
[2:54:52] <$legacy0117> Oh crap he is trapped using these abilities. Ouch. Though Knight defense bubble is definitely good
[2:55:57] <strifer413> welp this feels like trying to fight a soul boss with wheel. GG
[2:55:59] <%glass_marcus> this is a tanky boy
[2:56:17] <dukenux> loads of hp on this boi
[2:56:39] <%Superbro64> dang, if only we had a certain ability, that would allow us to float around and avoid damage completely. If only... Kappa
[2:56:45] <Vyneci> It looks like it's better to just mash than to ever use the charged attack
[2:56:48] <dukenux> Stinger! Stinger! Stinger!
[2:57:07] <357Sneak> SourPls
[2:57:11] <+croxeye> Heyyyyooooo how is everyone
[2:57:15] <$legacy0117> Tanky against stabby damage and energy damage, but likely weak to blunt and elemental damage.
[2:57:27] <%Broand> Just caught up on dokapon, no spoilers but that was some good shit
[2:57:37] <$legacy0117> IT IS.

[3:08:08] <JetpackMcQuack> Not my sonic
[3:08:14] <+TheOneCalledRock> didn't the devs make a 3D spark game too?
[3:08:15] <mrmister681> a jester who happens to be a spark
[3:08:17] <%Superbro64> I mean, what sonic levels? Aren't they all like that already?
[3:08:25] <mussyplussy> Speak is electricity who wanted to be an engineer but couldn't get a job because robots did everything
[3:08:35] <ObsceneKvng> hence why I like sonic colors
[3:08:42] <mussyplussy> So he joined a circus and was then replaced
[3:08:46] <mrmister681> @TheOneCalledRock yeah, you play as the robot in that one. It tries to have dmc combat too
[3:08:52] <+TheOneCalledRock> @Superbro64 depends who you talking too. Many people have different opinions on sonic levels OpieOP

[3:15:56] <TheShameHole> people down here pronounce oil with one syllable
[3:15:58] <kamichilli> what in the name of sonic is this game?
[3:16:00] <+x_geist> den-o is that you?
[3:16:09] <+kralec> @WoolieVersus also, I say "gonna" which isn't really a word. that's a southern smooshed word. so you get a phrase that sounds like I'mgonnagedadrink" which is "i'm going to get a drink" but slurred to all hell
[3:16:11] <kamichilli> ore sanjou!
[3:16:20] <biomegabear> welcome back to incorrect tone in conversations for the game
[3:16:23] <+endogreen> hello chat. hello woolie.
[3:16:24] <Klefth> I learned English from a young age and I can't even try to fake the accent of my region in my 1st language sooooo.... lol

[3:16:40] <+x_geist> doodBro @kamichilli
[3:16:42] <%Binary_Fireball> for me spelling is worse than speaking. I always fuck up words like maintenance
[3:16:48] <%FuqBoiSlim> supercallifragilicousespealidocious
[3:16:53] <+TheOneCalledRock> @SkyOceanGames where to begin! well to keep it small, the whole game was horrible developed, like beta footage was better that final footage
[3:16:54] <+jetjagger222> a little too raph
[3:16:54] <SkyOceanGames> needs 3d map line drawing
[3:16:57] <%jiggy_snipe> Formiekind DansGame
[3:16:58] <andrei11dr> But the real nightmare is not learning how to speak English but how to write it, at least for me

[3:18:13] <%jiggy_snipe> he doesn't have a health bar?
[3:18:19] <penitentpentwitch> I still find it funny "y'all" is one of the few third person group identifications in english that parallels "ustedes" in spanish
[3:18:21] <kamichilli> kamen rider 02
[3:18:25] <%FuqBoiSlim> notice how this dude doesnt have a health bar. hes that special
[3:18:42] <VectorSatyr> I don't remember, but I think that's a bug.
[3:18:51] <SkyOceanGames> what's the deal with auto levels on donkey kong
[3:18:52] <mussyplussy> Yeah I don't think that's supposed to happen
[3:18:55] <dukenux> PogChamp
[3:18:58] <%gatorafan> that bug's special too
[3:18:59] <+YabbaTroll> uhhh
[3:19:06] <@Solidus_113> that was a divekick
[3:19:12] <$legacy0117> BAMF
[3:19:16] <penitentpentwitch> Plot twist, you killed the hero?
[3:19:16] <%Broand> I hear some people like no mans sky now, No clue why, game is still as broad as the ocean and as shallow as a puddle
[3:19:18] <KeroKamina> i beleive that was the true final boss
[3:19:24] <+TheOneCalledRock> @KeroKamina and i will always mega respect respect hello games for sticking to their guns and fixing what was broke, not many devs can say that
[3:19:25] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:19:26] <+jetjagger222> naruhodo
[3:19:35] <mrmister681> he has Shadow shoes
[3:19:37] <andrei11dr> That looks important
[3:19:40] <%gatorafan> look at this Sonic OC
[3:19:50] <+jetjagger222> he's got the sazabi helmet
[3:19:53] <anarchistPastry> this dude reminds me of mecha sonic
[3:19:54] <Profmcsteevie> Bomberman could not give a fuck about these anime nerds, he smiles and detonates
[3:19:56] <KeroKamina> Hyper Max from Bomberman Jetters
[3:19:56] <SkyOceanGames> i have to watch an episode of gg. they just put up zelga
[3:19:58] <$legacy0117> Nah, Super Mario Z vibes here.
[3:20:00] <@Solidus_113> that's why we got Bomberman Zero
[3:20:08] <KeroKamina> i'm also getting SMBZ vibes

[3:20:33] <andrei11dr> The edge is real
[3:20:40] <+prime_name> That dude had Shadow shoes
[3:20:41] <+ZoltanBMagnus> is that a digimon?
[3:20:43] <+x_geist> kamen rider jester
[3:20:50] <%jiggy_snipe> that was the homie
[3:20:59] <%Broand> WATER LEVEL
[3:21:00] <%gatorafan> that guy was BUILT with the edge powerup
[3:21:04] <%WanderingSwordsman> This all started with him wanting his job back
[3:21:08] <+EySoyCoco> your type
[3:21:14] <+TheOneCalledRock> this game is giving me flashbacks to watching sonic sprite videos and playing sonic fan games on new grounds back i the day
[3:21:18] <+TheOneCalledRock> these are good feelings
[3:21:22] <+jetjagger222> taito-ass BGM
[3:21:43] <%Binary_Fireball> my biggest gripe with sonic games is that I think it wants me to go fast and then it hits me with a big wall killing my flow
[3:21:55] <Klefth> Mmmm, mm, this music
[3:21:58] <%Binary_Fireball> and Im like.... but that was the point, to go fast!?
[3:22:00] <+fetrigon> mmmmmm
[3:22:06] <KeroKamina> them violins tho
[3:22:09] <+TheOneCalledRock> the VIOLINS
[3:22:14] <+fetrigon> jiyuDaigasm
[3:22:15] <mussyplussy> I'm curious if Board lets you float over lava
[3:22:21] <+x_geist> SingsNote fatumSlaps SingsNote SingsNote
[3:22:22] <357Sneak> SourPls
[3:22:24] <mrmister681> violins in a game are always cool
[3:22:29] <Klefth> enbMusic enbMusic enbMusic enbMusic
[3:22:32] <%Binary_Fireball> is this what old persona music sounds like?
[3:22:34] <%Superbro64> The song is sad cuz homie is ded BibleThump
[3:22:35] <+jetjagger222> just needs the opera samples and it'll sound exactly like a zuntata track
[3:22:37] <KeroKamina> reminds me a bit of Kingdom Valley a little bit
[3:22:42] <Profmcsteevie> It feels a little....persona honestly
[3:22:56] <wunderkindest> This is some Ys overworld exploration music
[3:23:03] <KeroKamina> THIS VIOLIN IS GOING HAM
[3:23:03] <penitentpentwitch> Avenge your homie! Eat Big Smoke's order.
[3:23:17] <%FuqBoiSlim> ok dis hard
[3:23:21] <357Sneak> lytCRYA FBCatch zoneMayo Pourin one out
[3:23:23] <+fetrigon> 20k well spent
[3:23:23] <%Superbro64> Help! I'm trying to play this platformer, but I can't control my body from groovin to these sick beats!
[3:23:23] <357Sneak> for the Homie zoneMayoSquirt lytWAH
[3:23:28] <+x_geist> Persona regular world music
[3:23:36] <andrei11dr> This part of the song kinda reminds me of FFX
[3:23:55] <%Binary_Fireball> it would be a dope mechanic if you got secret powerups by moving to the beat
[3:24:22] <%Binary_Fireball> but not like crypt of the necrodancer where it's required
[3:24:29] <%FuqBoiSlim> I wonder how speedruns of this game look
[3:25:01] <VCryas> Sounds like a megaman sound track to me
[3:25:06] <%jiggy_snipe> a cutscene where the party does cool stuff
[3:25:08] <DarthTaco> @Binary_Fireball took me a bit to think of what to write but; being able to go fast in sonic games has a lot to do with memorization
[3:25:20] <+noajenkk> thats slick
[3:25:22] <DarthTaco> and you did get spiked, but you also had rings so you just keep going
[3:25:31] <andrei11dr> There was a guy in here who said he speedrunned this
[3:25:31] <wunderkindest> The music definitely gives me some Falcom vibes
[3:25:35] <VCryas> Also a speedrun of this game would be sick
[3:25:37] <DarthTaco> and can do it better next time
[3:25:43] <LaikaCDP> I'm gonna need to find some wallpapers
[3:25:54] <+jetjagger222> the piano is a bit reminiscent of akira's theme from VF5R
[3:25:59] <DingusMcBaseball> fast
[3:26:12] <%Binary_Fireball> @DarthTaco Yea I eventually learned that it's a skill and something you have to work toward but as a kid that's not what I wanted
[3:26:15] <%Superbro64> man, if woolie plays spark 2 at some point in the future, I will be over the future.
[3:26:24] <%Binary_Fireball> I should try replaying one but I have no idea which one to try
[3:26:32] <%gatorafan> this music is amazing
[3:26:33] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:26:34] <%Superbro64> spark 2 is those 3d sonic fangames realized as a product you can buy with money
[3:26:54] <KeroKamina> iirc firel ets you walk on and in lava in this level
[3:26:58] <andrei11dr> This background esthetic is giving me some strong Alien Soldier vibes
[3:27:12] <KeroKamina> oh wait no it was this fire shield
[3:27:15] <DingusMcBaseball> you did one there
[3:27:16] <RetroDLC> Oh hey, I was one of the backers for this Kickstarter
[3:27:27] <+fetrigon> They made 10k on Kickstarter for music and sound design. My mistake :Z
[3:27:29] <%Binary_Fireball> the memorization was super frustrating, I didn't want to memorize I wanted to see what was coming and be able to dodge but the camera was too limited
[3:27:49] <DarthTaco> i mean you didnt die, you just keep going
[3:28:11] <+TheOneCalledRock> i need to start backing games, but i'm so scared to lose my money LUL i missed out on the W101 kickstarter and i'm sad about that
[3:28:12] <DarthTaco> i never really thought about it as a kid
[3:28:25] <DarthTaco> i just brute forced my way through things
[3:28:27] <RetroDLC> I regret not backing Undertale and Hollow Knight
[3:28:36] <DarthTaco> cause sonic is made so you can do that
[3:28:43] <RetroDLC> Just as much as I regret buying Bitcoin when it started up
[3:28:44] <%Binary_Fireball> oh I also never bought it so my play sessions were always short
[3:29:02] <RetroDLC> *not buying, rather
[3:29:02] <%FuqBoiSlim> you think that's bad? the first game I ever backed was MN9 NotLikeThis
[3:29:09] <+TheOneCalledRock> OOF
[3:29:11] <+fetrigon> F
[3:29:19] <KaiserMario> Why is Woolie solo today?
[3:29:20] <%Binary_Fireball> MN9?
[3:29:24] <RetroDLC> I think that was my first KS too
[3:29:27] <%Broand> I backed starbound
[3:29:27] <SomariMan> I backed this on Kickstarter for the music. I'm so glad I did.
[3:29:29] <KeroKamina> @KaiserMario reggie is sick
[3:29:30] <+TheOneCalledRock> and that's what i am afraid of, to back another mighty number 9
[3:29:32] <%FuqBoiSlim> mighty number 9
[3:29:33] <%Broand> I regret it every day
[3:29:34] <biomegabear> @FuqBoiSlim nah, you put in money for a good intetion
[3:29:35] <%Binary_Fireball> oooh
[3:29:36] <mrmister681> I like solo, it's pretty chill
[3:29:40] <rcand9> the saves look massively out of place with these nice backgrounds
[3:29:50] <KaiserMario> oh, I hope Reggie gets better soon
[3:30:33] <andrei11dr> Mighty Nr. 9 at least showed us who Inefune really was !
[3:30:46] <%Binary_Fireball> me too Reggie's smile is like a golden ray of sunlight after a nasty storm. The world is a more grim and desolate place without his infectious charisma
[3:31:00] <VectorSatyr> That was my favorite level in the game.
[3:31:10] <+noajenkk> PogChamp

[3:31:44] <$legacy0117> I so want to get Freedom Planet, but may have to get this game first. It has everything that makes a game in this style Feel So Good.

[3:34:37] <%arcielardor> the Kirby star wand
[3:34:53] <+TheOneCalledRock> i dunno man, Darkest Dungeon already pops people blood vessels. adding PvP sound like it will make that worse LUL
[3:35:11] <rcand9> board looks rad
[3:35:14] <+x_geist> its kosher
[3:35:26] <$legacy0117> I kinda have to redownload it, but I gotta see how it works first. If it's a bunch of Dark Dungeon squads in GIANT levels, I will be happy.
[3:35:39] <LVDoomien> its 1v1 matches
[3:35:40] <$Invlux> We need a Jetset radio styled Sonic clone

[3:37:32] <$jobbedbone> sword n board
[3:37:33] <%FuqBoiSlim> The ads are shilling for all your power ups I just realized LUL
[3:37:33] <biomegabear> yes
[3:37:42] <rcand9> BLUE BALLs
[3:37:46] <%Superbro64> yes
[3:38:31] <$legacy0117> I will probably get this game next. It is very lively and if you get new character stories accessible during play, I would l ik ke that z lot.
[3:38:43] <biomegabear> parry system
[3:38:44] <$legacy0117> like*
[3:38:54] <KeroKamina> in spark 2 the parry builds meter
[3:39:06] <unclekulikov> ROYALGUARD
[3:39:14] <+iN33DaNam3> hi
[3:39:28] <VectorSatyr> @KeroKamina It does here, too.
[3:39:28] <%FuqBoiSlim> look at that Nier automata ass dodge. I look
[3:39:30] <$legacy0117> Parry dodges are real, as I thought.
[3:39:43] <KeroKamina> ah didn't realize
[3:39:47] <%FuqBoiSlim> all he needs is a counterattack off it
[3:39:53] <$legacy0117> Only certain classes can use it though probably.
[3:39:53] <KeroKamina> i never new it was a thing in spark 1 until now
[3:39:58] <+TheOneCalledRock> board is just the best for mobility isn't it?
[3:40:28] <%jepupu> BELKA
[3:40:34] <%FuqBoiSlim> its definitely the fastest
[3:40:34] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[3:40:43] <KeroKamina> maybe some state/provence flags, otherwise i can't think of any
[3:40:43] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:40:47] <+fetrigon> non binary flag
[3:40:56] <legacyofsol> Just got into the chat. This reminds me a lot of Freedom Planet. Is it the same team?
[3:41:01] <VectorSatyr> No.
[3:41:03] <+TheOneCalledRock> nope
[3:41:04] <@Solidus_113> Belka from Ace Combat has it, but still fiction
[3:41:04] <spectra_s02> Nope
[3:41:07] <%FuqBoiSlim> NonBinaryPride
[3:41:08] <Profmcsteevie> Flags throughout history definitely have it, some old Russian one if I recalls
[3:41:09] <KeroKamina> completely different team
[3:41:33] <+TheOneCalledRock> WEEEEEE
[3:41:36] <+Koover> speed o clock

[3:41:58] <+fetrigon> jiyuDaigasm
[3:42:05] <andrei11dr> Rolling around at the speed of sound indeed
[3:42:10] <biomegabear> I never used board alot so this feels new to me
[3:42:18] <KeroKamina> the creator tried to get both games for consoles but wasn't able to
[3:42:31] <legacyofsol> Cool~ Good to know. Thanks~ doodShine bleedPurple
[3:42:52] <+Koover> Chemical plant zone
[3:43:02] <+Koover> going down that big ol hill
[3:43:05] <LVDoomien> okay therre's my note for Woolie about DD PVP so I'm gonna dip
[3:43:07] <rcand9> oh ye
[3:43:07] <LVDoomien> my task is complete
[3:43:08] <KeroKamina> i loved when it happend in the sonic advanced games aswell, which added after images
[3:43:08] <+TheOneCalledRock> yeyeyey i mentioned that earlier, that shit so good
[3:43:15] <penitentpentwitch> Although that makes it real easy to hit stuff offscreen
[3:43:17] <LVDoomien> enjoy the rest of the stream gamers
[3:43:21] <%Superbro64> chemical plant, hydrocity
[3:43:24] <biomegabear> gravity
[3:43:42] <%Superbro64> problem is, you SPEED past like, weeks worth of level design that way
[3:43:42] <rcand9> sonic rush was pretty good at that
[3:44:00] <+x_geist> F for gravity
[3:44:10] <%Superbro64> sonic team literally had to come up with an engine to deal with the fact that in 3d, you speed by content TOO fast
[3:44:19] <%Superbro64> for unleashed and so
[3:44:19] <@Solidus_113> GRAV BACK
[3:44:24] <+fetrigon> @kerokamina Yeah click team fusion is a bitch to port to other consoles and I think he needs a connect that can "validate" him as a trustworthy dev to console makers.
[3:44:29] <DarthTaco> its a problem they havent fixed yet
[3:44:30] <+TheOneCalledRock> i think sonic rush had a nice balance with speed a level design. the sonic advance games as well
[3:44:33] <+x_geist> woot!
[3:44:36] <$legacy0117> GRAVITY. YEAH
[3:44:39] <DarthTaco> the hedgehog engine is for lighting
[3:44:45] <%FuqBoiSlim> I thought Woolie gave up on gravity and went full Boardmaster LUL
[3:44:58] <KeroKamina> gotta speed keed
[3:45:02] <DarthTaco> but yea that is why forces had so many short levels and generations only had a few long levels
[3:45:27] <KeroKamina> we truely are the Sonic Riders Zero Gravity
[3:45:27] <%Superbro64> generations had more 2d sections I feel
[3:45:28] <@Solidus_113> You're on a train now
[3:45:35] <Dodolo212> Woolie condones speeding
[3:45:35] <$legacy0117> We on a TRAIN now!

[3:49:01] <rcand9> PogChamp
[3:49:11] <+Koover> cut the top of the train off
[3:49:12] <$legacy0117> Gravity is more like, Air mobility + High Damage.

[3:55:19] <@Moobot> 1196 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[3:55:43] <penitentpentwitch> My only problem with piloting Mecha in Doom Eternal is how much slower the gameplay would be
[3:55:56] <+jetjagger222> not all games can be metal slug
[3:56:26] <%Superbro64> Kamiya is FURIOUSLY calling his team at platinum to make sure that no mechs will be piloted, but WILL BE SEEN, in his ultraman game
[3:56:28] <%Superbro64> Kappa
[3:56:31] <VectorSatyr> The mechs were walking around and active on the train in the previous level, but you skipped past them.
[3:56:35] <KeroKamina> i wish the megaman games kept Ride Armor
[3:56:37] <BettyMwwaahh> has woolie beat Doom Eternal yet?
[3:56:38] <%ekodrop> that's you

[4:02:20] <%floralkami> *actually
[4:02:21] <Victory_Boss> Sick people could hurt you too, just toss them out
[4:02:35] <mark_collins45> The game title in the sidebar made it look like the games name was Spark The Electric Jesus
[4:02:39] <RetroDLC> "A corpse... should be left well alone." Maria
[4:02:41] <KeroKamina> eggplant?

[4:03:10] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[4:03:18] <andrei11dr> For some reason, my mind went to that Ryu description from one of the SF guides, where it says "Ryu has no friends, no family and no life" LUL
[4:03:23] <$legacy0117> As long as he doesn't fly, your fine.
[4:03:26] <KeroKamina> i think the light attack stuns you
[4:03:27] <%floralkami> wow, back to back bosses
[4:03:48] <KeroKamina> atleast you have that backup bar
[4:03:50] <AstratesticoMan> the bosses look cooler than they fight
[4:03:59] <The_Maddness> do the saves not bring you back at full?
[4:04:00] <%floralkami> he FLASHED YOU
[4:04:02] <penitentpentwitch> Isn't that a precursor of the end?
[4:04:18] <$legacy0117> Also, his purple color probably dictates that he is a Gravity type enemy.
[4:04:25] <$legacy0117> Btw.
[4:04:27] <%floralkami> fucking tos destroying robot
[4:04:29] <KeroKamina> @AstratesticoMan to be fair he's cheesign these bosses hard
[4:04:32] <someyounguy1> i have seen 2 bosses so far and both have fired attacks from their butts. is this a trend i should worry about?
[4:04:33] <%gatorafan> The hypest gameplay on Twitch! woolieCHAN
[4:04:42] <%NyxFang> woolieYE
[4:04:50] <andrei11dr> He's doing no damage
[4:04:50] <penitentpentwitch> When in doubt, Cheese it out!
[4:05:02] <$legacy0117> The alternative is PAIN.
[4:05:05] <%Superbro64> should of held onto hammer
[4:05:10] <%Superbro64> err bat
[4:05:13] <penitentpentwitch> It's magic pixel time!
[4:05:14] <%floralkami> don't look directly into its bulb hole
[4:05:18] <$legacy0117> Gravity scum this B*Tch.
[4:05:18] <%Superbro64> should of kept bat
[4:05:27] <+Ether101_Prime> Gravity feels broken.
[4:05:31] <andrei11dr> Almost there
[4:05:40] <KeroKamina> it is
[4:05:43] <KeroKamina> that's why it's so rare
[4:06:03] <%Superbro64> I imagine gravity is hardly used by speedrunners, as it takes literally forever
[4:06:05] <%Damie904> It's super sonic with a way lower damage output, so yea
[4:06:11] <someyounguy1> MY NAME, IS GYOBU MASATAKA ONIWA

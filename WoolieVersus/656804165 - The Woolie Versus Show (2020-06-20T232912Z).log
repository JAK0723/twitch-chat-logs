[0:30:19] <arkv01> woolie needs some hand botox
[0:30:21] <missingangle> (Has small hands) I don’t see the problem here
[0:30:25] <%FlakkLIVE> The micro was impossibly small
[0:30:35] <Am_Shigar00> I want a Micro just to see how horrible it is to hold.
[0:30:36] <Texascourierlive> it was to soy for woolie
[0:30:36] <arkv01> the micro was basically a novelty item
[0:30:39] <projectmanatees> i dont know anyone who liked the micro
[0:30:39] <+Dimfish> no @thoraxe237 so no spoilers!
[0:30:39] <%ChoculaUltra> "just get smaller hands!" - one guy
[0:30:40] <+ShutUpAceyP> Woolie eats GBMicro's for breakfast
[0:30:45] <SomersaultJustice> game and watches are kinda big
[0:30:47] <+Dimfish> omcw
[0:30:50] <%DatAsuna> game and watches were huge
[0:30:51] <Potatoidea> GB Micro is way smaller in person than it seems
[0:30:53] <RamenRiderZ> Didnt Gamecube have a GBA player?
[0:30:56] <@Menitta> Its crazy how quickly enemies you already faced become worthless in terms of exp
[0:31:01] <SomersaultJustice> @RamenRiderZ yes
[0:31:04] <+yoshkosh20> Woolies got the yaoi hands
[0:31:04] <nin10play> @RamenRiderZ yup
[0:31:06] <+Dimfish> once again people this is a blind LP so please no spoilers
[0:31:11] <arkv01> aggressive level scaling?
[0:31:12] <Am_Shigar00> @Menitta It certainly makes grinding extremely impractical
[0:31:17] <HenryHenshin> you can take that SF badge off now
[0:31:18] <+ShutUpAceyP> the only thing sucky about micro is the cartridge sticks out
[0:31:24] <HenryHenshin> *sound effect
[0:31:25] <Papa_Bearman> I had a Famicom GBA Micro, but it got stolen.
[0:31:25] <Solidnick18> almost a level

[0:31:47] <Am_Shigar00> @Solidus_113 Appearntly that's actually super common with GC player owners.

[0:33:14] <CyrusVGZ> TYD is a great starting point.

[0:35:01] <Am_Shigar00> @Saltmeisterr I assume you don't have a Wii U because the first game is on the virtual console there.
[0:35:02] <CastellanVon> @WoolieVersus These enemies are giving you 1-2 exp, it's not really worth fighting past enemies.
[0:35:02] <thorn0516> did he do any big number grinding off screen?

[0:45:11] <+pectusumbra> I mean that's still right
[0:45:15] <MonsterEnvy> She also has more attack power now
[0:45:15] <+Grayhammatter> MULTIBONK
[0:45:19] <sunnythedrunk> Koops' later abilities are way more useful
[0:45:19] <rubbishbinge> 20 hp huge
[0:45:20] <Hyper_charger> she has more health now!
[0:45:21] <bbblaketwitching> she is better early with badges than most
[0:45:24] <MonsterEnvy> She does 2 damage base now
[0:45:27] <%Proxzo> Tengen Toppa Gurren Goombella
[0:45:28] <%DukeBlack_> monsta cardo
[0:45:28] <SixthSun2> HUGE HP
[0:45:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> Unlimibonk.
[0:45:30] <R3c0n31> Go hard move
[0:45:30] <generalve> he using dolphin ?
[0:45:31] <Robot_Nixon_> give em the BOP
[0:45:31] <+marumariball> she got more HP too
[0:45:32] <%cobalt_phoenix_> b o n k
[0:45:34] <vaderxyz1970> Gombella was my best Tank
[0:45:34] <+pectusumbra> There's plenty in the game
[0:45:36] <%Jpshum> bonk
[0:45:37] <@Menitta> BOP
[0:45:38] <+Grayhammatter> give em the BOP
[0:45:39] <tusk_act4> Goombella isn't good in the long term, but you get plenty of Shine Sprites later so it's good.
[0:45:41] <+AsinPersuasion> she got attack and defense too
[0:45:42] <kingkeldeo31> Go to the door
[0:45:45] <sunnythedrunk> To be honest you should have saved the sprites
[0:45:47] <MonsterEnvy> @WoolieVersus She does 2 damage base now as well.
[0:45:56] <%Monkeyweed21> Goombella stays solid cuz of tattle
[0:45:56] <Dreziv> saved the sprites for fuckin' what? Flurrie?
[0:45:56] <bbblaketwitching> someone used gombella as a tank over B-man?
[0:45:57] <JetpackMcQuack> Imma bonk a bitch
[0:46:00] <Belakitu> Wait, what about Koops?
[0:46:01] <muniea3> Noose-chan
[0:46:02] <Kyphen15> Low key Shine Sprites are hard to find
[0:46:03] <generalve> Chat is he using a Emulator ?
[0:46:05] <+AsinPersuasion> @tusk_act4 her ability to give mario a second turn is dope
[0:46:05] <%snakest3alth> The noose
[0:46:07] <bbblaketwitching> what an odd individual
[0:46:07] <Am_Shigar00> I almost always keep the Goomba party member as my default, having tattle is always useful, and I love having the weakest Mario enemy kicking ass all the time.
[0:46:15] <%Monkeyweed21> Tattle will help woolie alot
[0:46:15] <sunnythedrunk> Saved the sprites for the last 3 partners duh
[0:46:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh hey mouse
[0:46:17] <nin10play> I can't wait until we get to Chapter 3. I wanna see Woolie love it
[0:46:17] <sleepystardewfarmer> have you checked out the split wall next to Luigi?
[0:46:18] <%lewdskeletor13> The Peadow Noose
[0:46:19] <Amardeux> woolie be thinking of Disgaea LUL
[0:46:19] <+AsinPersuasion> and since mario is hands down the strongest it has the most value
[0:46:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> I like your tail mouse
[0:46:27] <Drusain> Item World? Woolie playing Disgaea?
[0:46:28] <+nechallenger> Oh hey look at the mouse
[0:46:31] <+CharredChord> who could that be? Kappa
[0:46:32] <+duckmeat_woohoo> WHO DAT MOUSE
[0:46:35] <thoraxe237> keep a noose around in a town where almost nobody has a neck, yea ok
[0:46:39] <+twohitgood> the simplifier is good
[0:46:39] <Dreziv> I imagine Woolie will get all the shines
[0:46:43] <Amardeux> @Drusain probably LUL
[0:46:46] <+Grayhammatter> who dat mouse
[0:46:47] <bbblaketwitching> damn I missed this man getting aloooot of badges
[0:46:50] <%Proxzo> Does the random badge seller appear after chapter 1?
[0:46:51] <kingkeldeo31> That mouse has a weird lookin tail
[0:46:53] <%mrjojothelion> WHO DAT MOUSE THO
[0:46:53] <+ckangaroo15k> Early badges in the shop suck.
[0:46:54] <grizzleyzack> Do you understand zoro?
[0:46:55] <Am_Shigar00> hm, kind of a weak badge set.
[0:46:56] <+marumariball> cool looking mouse
[0:46:57] <Hyper_charger> check out that mouse tail!
[0:46:59] <qsirius> Last Stand is OP as balls
[0:46:59] <+TheDyingPride> That mouse is real familiar
[0:47:01] <tusk_act4> <3
[0:47:01] <+AsinPersuasion> simplifier nerfs your SP gain though
[0:47:02] <ppbghd> talk to shopkeep
[0:47:03] <ingman112> Shhhhhh
[0:47:06] <MonsterEnvy> @WoolieVersus Don't forget about about the Star Piece Merchant Dazzy
[0:47:07] <Potatoidea> Yeah, this mouse has a cool hat
[0:47:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> clempsMischief <3
[0:47:15] <@Menitta> I love the mice in Paper Mario
[0:47:16] <nin10play> @WoolieVersus If you talk to the mouse with the cap they have more in stock, the stuff on the shelf is just on sale, if you didn't already know.
[0:47:18] <+AsinPersuasion> hey that mouse looks familiar
[0:47:19] <+linSP> Mario must die style badge
[0:47:19] <Taarin> Super Appeal becomes more valuable later in the late game
[0:47:24] <bbblaketwitching> AND NOT HER FEET
[0:47:25] <Am_Shigar00> hmmmmmmmm
[0:47:26] <SomersaultJustice> totes adorbz
[0:47:28] <+AbnormalVoid> hmmmm
[0:47:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie figured it out.
[0:47:29] <Solidnick18> hmmmmmm
[0:47:29] <noe_juan_kanobe> Is the Trouble Center even open at this point?
[0:47:33] <+pectusumbra> also talk to the store mouse and he'll offer more
[0:47:38] <+GreenCMD> check the shopkeep for quick change
[0:47:40] <ppbghd> isn't there a badge that lets you swap partners w/o losing a turn
[0:47:42] <+pectusumbra> Phantom Thief!
[0:47:46] <arkv01> what a cutie <3
[0:47:49] <Saltmeisterr> tattle her?
[0:47:50] <rubbishbinge> what a charming stranger
[0:47:50] <+CharredChord> SELLING BADGES BY DAYLIGHT
[0:47:52] <tusk_act4> You need to wait for that
[0:47:56] <MonsterEnvy> The free swapping badge is underground.
[0:47:57] <Am_Shigar00> Whoooo knooooows?
[0:48:02] <MonsterEnvy> With the Star Piece Merchant.
[0:48:03] <%p4ntless> I'm a shapeshifter~
[0:48:04] <%Proxzo> whaaddaya buyin?
[0:48:08] <+CharredChord> STEALING BADGES BY MOONLIGHT
[0:48:13] <Taarin> At Poes Masquerade!
[0:48:20] <+Superbro64> considering that ANY partner can be in a cutscene and offer their comments, Mowz would probably not remember
[0:48:23] <GypsyMagi> Has woolie tattled on her?
[0:48:23] <tusk_act4> Happy Flower is real good
[0:48:24] <+HyperCharge_Sam> Happy Flower PogChamp
[0:48:26] <guyman125> You should check the star piece merchant out for the quick change badge
[0:48:27] <+Superbro64> or anyone for that matter
[0:48:28] <megatronsdong96> At Poes Mousequerade
[0:48:29] <%dinnydanny777> Can you check her with Goombella?
[0:48:31] <tusk_act4> But unforuntely it is expensive.
[0:48:35] <Am_Shigar00> oooh, FP badges are pretty nice.
[0:48:36] <Bguy32> it's so you buy back badges you sold
[0:48:36] <bbblaketwitching> ooooh close call
[0:48:45] <redmage216> What about the rat at the docks?
[0:48:54] <Kyphen15> Sometimes theres a guy that sells badges by the noose
[0:48:55] <Amardeux> time to go grinding LUL
[0:49:00] <bbblaketwitching> 46 down sadly
[0:49:00] <shiny_prinny> YES! YES! YES!
[0:49:01] <+Superbro64> reminder that Koops is lame, and you should switch to goombella for her much cooler and much less lame observations
[0:49:01] <+AsinPersuasion> YAAAAAS
[0:49:03] <+Euphbugg> GET SOME MORE MONIES
[0:49:04] <bbblaketwitching> no it isnt
[0:49:09] <sunnythedrunk> Happy Flower >>>>
[0:49:09] <+EternalJedi> the8bitSellout
[0:49:12] <Calek> that doesn't seem good at all
[0:49:13] <MonsterEnvy> Happy Flower is the best
[0:49:17] <+HyperCharge_Sam> sell some badges you don't need
[0:49:17] <Solidnick18> happy flower the best
[0:49:18] <%Monkeyweed21> HAPPY FLOWER IS 10/10
[0:49:19] <Am_Shigar00> any badges he doesn't really need that he could sell?
[0:49:20] <$LightningLynx89> That is not better, Happy Flower is the best
[0:49:21] <%Proxzo> Does this badge rotate?
[0:49:21] <%psidefx> Happy flower is the move
[0:49:21] <Bguy32> sell badges for money
[0:49:24] <+ckangaroo15k> FP drain isn't good, you use too much FP later in the game.
[0:49:26] <+CharredChord> Fuck that. Attack power is better
[0:49:28] <zettig> Don't get FP Drain! You only have 1 Attack Power
[0:49:28] <thorn0516> fp drain seems really bad
[0:49:28] <@Solidus_113> Isn't there one that goes in the world?
[0:49:30] <bbblaketwitching> fp drain is hilarious trash
[0:49:31] <+Euphbugg> Happy Flower
[0:49:31] <nin10play> @WoolieVersus The bearded guy near the noose also has some really special badges that might interest you...
[0:49:32] <%bread_assassin> FP drain doesn't seem worth it compared to Happy Flower.
[0:49:38] <tusk_act4> No it isn't. Because this game has low numbers, a single drop in attack power is really bad.
[0:49:38] <Calek> never lower attack
[0:49:39] <SomersaultJustice> half
[0:49:44] <@Menitta> WHADDYA SELLIN
[0:49:44] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:49:46] <+QuadraticGravity> YEAH MORE MARIO
[0:49:51] <Taarin> Would FP drain drop his AP to zero?
[0:49:51] <qsirius> Flower Saver from the star piece shop is better
[0:49:54] <MonsterEnvy> Attack FX R is a good pice
[0:49:57] <sunnythedrunk> Attack FX
[0:49:59] <+AsinPersuasion> @WoolieVersus sell attack fx
[0:50:00] <MonsterEnvy> You don't need it anymore
[0:50:00] <Bguy32> sell FX R
[0:50:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> AttackFX?
[0:50:00] <Solidnick18> the lowest price ones
[0:50:01] <thorn0516> attack fx r is pretty useless at this point
[0:50:02] <%kyh9> CRICKET
[0:50:02] <$LightningLynx89> Attack FX R
[0:50:03] <KatabolicRage> tbh that peril skill is hyper specific
[0:50:04] <+marumariball> duplicates stack
[0:50:06] <Am_Shigar00> Attack FX would be good if you don't care for sound effects.
[0:50:07] <bbblaketwitching> he could use hammer and fp moves
[0:50:07] <%kyh9> ATTACK FX R
[0:50:12] <%psidefx> Attack FX
[0:50:14] <%Proxzo> aww
[0:50:15] <bbblaketwitching> but base jumps, yes
[0:50:17] <+Cavumentum> SELL IT
[0:50:17] <Bguy32> You can buy back Badges!
[0:50:24] <R3c0n31> Duplicates do stack right?
[0:50:32] <thorn0516> duplicates do stack
[0:50:33] <+Grayhammatter> duplicates do stack
[0:50:36] <guyman125> you don't need the hp plus since it is just trading a bp level for a health level up
[0:50:44] <Solidnick18> yay the lottery
[0:50:45] <+HyperCharge_Sam> HE SELLS DANK SHIT

[1:14:51] <ingman112> Nope
[1:14:52] <nin10play> @bbblaketwitching Oh. Sorry I thought you said that as in a way that you meant you were leaving. My bad
[1:14:54] <thetntm> Woolie I'd reccommend using your new star move asap the timing takes practice to really use it effectively
[1:15:00] <Calek> you have to go back to the door to progress, he's fine

[1:15:14] <Kyphen15> Oh Yeah, you should have enough star pieces to get quick change badge from dazzle
[1:15:18] <+TheDyingPride> Koops also has 2 style points there if you don't mash

[1:19:30] <NotHereToStream> consumables
[1:19:36] <Daveythe6thMoon> Status ailments are surprisingly rare to deal with in this game.

[1:20:15] <Am_Shigar00> @bread_assassin There is an optional upgrade for it.
[1:20:18] <Taarin> I feel that need to hoard items too, but it's not worth it
[1:20:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> As someone with ADHD, this game would punish me so hard for my distractability.
[1:20:28] <%democrazyyy> did they ever find out where the next destination is?

[1:47:13] <nin10play> @WoolieVersus It detects if you change the time on the clock and you'll need to pay like 100 coins for a new one. This lottery is actually super rigged when you'll even win.

[1:47:58] <+agumon9000> @WoolieVersus You get a ticket which is set numbers. The board has the winning numbers. At midnight the board changes the numbers. You keep the one ticket until you decide to get a new on. So one ticket can be used multiple days

[3:04:40] <Bguy32> Use the Tremor!
[3:04:41] <Kyphen15> Attack goes up when you power up partners with shine sprites
[3:04:42] <bbblaketwitching> and green
[3:04:49] <bbblaketwitching> I didn't even wait
[3:04:49] <%MonsterEnvy> @WoolieVersus Tremor ignores defense

[3:04:59] <Taarin> @WoolieVersus Tremor hits everything on the screen
[3:05:00] <shiny_prinny> tremor hits fliers if you don't mess up the inputs
[3:05:01] <%snakest3alth> Woolie, you have fucking items
[3:05:03] <Am_Shigar00> Tremor ignores Defense.
[3:05:06] <%SirGO0SE> Reggie LUL
[3:05:06] <bbblaketwitching> too obvious
[3:05:08] <grimshuck> for fucks sake. tremor ignores defense.
[3:05:09] <nin10play> @WoolieVersus Special Moves like Earth Tremor go through defense.
[3:05:09] <%MonsterEnvy> @WoolieVersus Tremor Ignores defense
[3:05:10] <+AsinPersuasion> there was the 3
[3:05:11] <Gallhint> \mooka chakka pacha
[3:05:12] <kingkeldeo31> Tremor can hit air borne if you'r goood enough
[3:05:12] <bbblaketwitching> DrinkPurple
[3:05:13] <Daveythe6thMoon> Hopefully this experience teaches this: Bring some syrup with ya!
[3:05:14] <%Th3SmartAlec> @snakest3alth But what if he needs them later?
[3:05:15] <+TheDyingPride> tremor hits flying enemies if you keep the combo going enough to reach them
[3:05:24] <%mrjojothelion> YO THE FLIP THO
[3:05:29] <Hellarussian> whens Rawk?
[3:05:30] <%Th3SmartAlec> Maybe you should use it more than once
[3:05:31] <+Cavumentum> If you hit the buttons well enough
[3:05:31] <thetntm> it does if you do it enough
[3:05:31] <+Grayhammatter> it affects them
[3:05:32] <Bguy32> You would know if you actually use it!
[3:05:33] <+pectusumbra> it's really good if you can do combo
[3:05:35] <@Menitta> Oh tremor ignores defense
[3:05:37] <glass_marcus> It depends how well you do
[3:05:37] <bbblaketwitching> it goes high enough
[3:05:38] <%Th3SmartAlec> ALLLLLLLL
[3:05:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> This isn't Pokemon, there's no Typing.
[3:05:39] <$Superdandy96> Tremor is busted good... if you can nail the timing
[3:05:41] <Self_esteampunk> yeah
[3:05:41] <+Euphbugg> need 3 success to hit air
[3:05:42] <rubbishbinge> if you shake it up enough
[3:05:43] <bbblaketwitching> GET GOOD
[3:05:44] <Papa_Bearman> If you keep the combo going long enough, it'll hit air enemies after a few.
[3:05:44] <%Struggleful> If effects people in the air if you DON'T FUCK IT UP
[3:05:45] <%GrassCannon> ALL enemies
[3:05:45] <%Th3SmartAlec> "All"
[3:05:46] <+pectusumbra> and it goes ALOT
[3:05:46] <Solidnick18> It's amazing
[3:05:46] <%DukeBlack_> test it out
[3:05:47] <nin10play> @Hellarussian Chapter 3. We haven't even got to chapter 2 yet
[3:05:49] <Solidnick18> ALL
[3:05:49] <%Monkeyweed21> it goes higher if you do good
[3:05:51] <zekana> higher the trimmer level, the higher the damage reaches
[3:05:51] <FoxInABeret> Big enough success hits fliers too.
[3:05:52] <sileo_patronus> It does not say Grounded Enemies
[3:05:55] <+Euphbugg> It maxes at 5 bars, 3 for air
[3:05:56] <shiny_prinny> the more bars you get, the higher the tremor hits
[3:05:56] <bbblaketwitching> THERE ARE MANY MANY BARS
[3:06:01] <+CharredChord> more bars: more damage
[3:06:02] <delta278899> You can hold your fire with sweat treat by Holding left. @WoolieVersus
[3:06:05] <Papa_Bearman> There are six bars, I think.
[3:06:05] <Nyerp> pow block tho
[3:06:06] <+Grayhammatter> you only hit the first bar, but there are actually MANY bars
[3:06:07] <$Superdandy96> NO SPOILERS PLS lytGN lytGN lytGN
[3:06:09] <Bguy32> There's like 7 Bars
[3:06:12] <Kyphen15> Theres more than 2 bars just to give you a heads up
[3:06:16] <%Th3SmartAlec> Why
[3:06:19] <Hellarussian> @nin10play oh ok, thanks. Its been a minute since iv'e played this game
[3:06:19] <Belakitu> lytGN Chat pls
[3:06:20] <Darren716> Woolie no
[3:06:21] <%DukeBlack_> there's no reason not to test it out so you know for sure
[3:06:22] <Bguy32> why
[3:06:24] <%MonsterEnvy> Wrong Hammer
[3:06:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> Why piercing
[3:06:24] <Papa_Bearman> They have 0 defense when they're on their backs.
[3:06:26] <kingkeldeo31> WOOOLIW
[3:06:26] <thetntm> tremor only ignores one type of enemy and you haven't encountered them yet
[3:06:48] <bbblaketwitching> I'm spoiling an attack me show him the iconic hidden spot?!?!
[3:06:55] <grimshuck> why is he using piercing on a downed koopa
[3:06:55] <Bguy32> It's Woolie just completely ignoring the tattles?

[3:08:52] <%SuperKirby24> EXCELLENT
[3:08:52] <%Proxzo> these guys have 1 Def
[3:08:53] <SixthSun2> Frame one
[3:08:54] <Daveythe6thMoon> 6 damage to all enemies, Earth Tremor is a solid special!
[3:08:54] <kingkeldeo31> use fire flower
[3:08:54] <+Cavumentum> Hammer time
[3:08:55] <%MonsterEnvy> They have 1 defense
[3:08:55] <+QuadraticGravity> 1 defense
[3:08:56] <%DrStinkers> POW
[3:08:56] <stormhawk9891> Fire
[3:08:59] <%Th3SmartAlec> Jump is weaker
[3:08:59] <%MonsterEnvy> No
[3:09:00] <bbblaketwitching> ...
[3:09:00] <%mrjojothelion> they have 1 defense
[3:09:01] <Am_Shigar00> They're armored and can make more allies.
[3:09:01] <+pectusumbra> fire flower is good
[3:09:01] <+Grayhammatter> they have one defense
[3:09:01] <Nyerp> pow block tho
[3:09:03] <%kyh9> Hammer
[3:09:03] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> koops
[3:09:03] <thetntm> normal hammer works
[3:09:03] <Papa_Bearman> Koops can take care of them!
[3:09:03] <%gatorafan> ULTRAAAAAAAA
[3:09:04] <+GreenCMD> they have 1 def
[3:09:04] <Darren716> No woolie
[3:09:05] <%kyh9> No
[3:09:06] <%Th3SmartAlec> Use Koops
[3:09:06] <bevyrage> fire or koops
[3:09:07] <%Proxzo> reg hammer is fine
[3:09:07] <SixthSun2> they just have 1 defense
[3:09:07] <+QuadraticGravity> means they take 1 less damage from each instance
[3:09:08] <%kyh9> They have 1 defense
[3:09:09] <%mrjojothelion> normal works
[3:09:10] <frigglefroogle> reg hammer is good
[3:09:10] <+TheDyingPride> 1 definitely, but fire is effective
[3:09:10] <+Euphbugg> Switch partner with enemy and use Koops turn
[3:09:11] <%Jpshum> Nice
[3:09:11] <Bguy32> Woolie had completely forgotten all the information from the tattles NotLikeThis
[3:09:12] <%Monkeyweed21> Just hammer them
[3:09:13] <%mrjojothelion> or that does too
[3:09:15] <+HyperCharge_Sam> yeah!
[3:09:15] <thetntm> normal hammer perirces eneough
[3:09:15] <Am_Shigar00> As long as you do 2 or more damage, you're good.
[3:09:16] <%kyh9> Normal hammer
[3:09:17] <kulmoth> does woolie understand how defense works?
[3:09:17] <bbblaketwitching> yes you have to use the thing you bought yourself woolie
[3:09:17] <Papa_Bearman> Eh, this works, too.
[3:09:18] <Solidnick18> well then
[3:09:19] <shiny_prinny> they have 1 def and your jump does 1 per hit
[3:09:19] <lambishly> that works too
[3:09:20] <Taarin> SeemsGood
[3:09:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> REKT
[3:09:20] <%Th3SmartAlec> That works too
[3:09:21] <+Euphbugg> Fire works
[3:09:21] <guyman125> hammer does 2 damage so it kills them despite them having 1 def
[3:09:22] <Taarin> ez
[3:09:30] <Nyerp> items = good
[3:09:33] <+GreenCMD> Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Slow
[3:09:35] <%Th3SmartAlec> @guyman125 2-1=1 ??????????
[3:09:36] <lambishly> used an item Pat is SCREAMING right now lol
[3:09:38] <bbblaketwitching> basic math is the deal
[3:09:39] <Daveythe6thMoon> Works just fine. Like Paper Mario wants you to do: You use it or you lose it!
[3:09:39] <rubbishbinge> hammer with the action command does 2 damage
[3:09:44] <%MonsterEnvy> Piercing blow is worthless unless the enemy has more then 2 defense. In all other cases Power Smash is better
[3:09:46] <+Superbro64> woolie knows how to use items?? :O
[3:09:50] <bbblaketwitching> no
[3:09:54] <redmage216> back one room then up
[3:09:54] <%Monkeyweed21> the Thousand year LP
[3:09:56] <Bguy32> no
[3:09:56] <thetntm> wooolie
[3:09:57] <kingkeldeo31> Jump does half of hammers damage but twice
[3:10:00] <frigglefroogle> ??
[3:10:00] <thesickestzak> :)
[3:10:01] <Taarin> It's fine I guess
[3:10:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> He's back a room and upstairs.
[3:10:02] <rubbishbinge> how can this be
[3:10:02] <Papa_Bearman> You're wasting FP on Piercing Blow.
[3:10:07] <jackarrow1> piercing is wasting fp
[3:10:07] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:10:09] <SiegeJay> S
[3:10:10] <guyman125> @Th3SmartAlec they have 1 life so that is correct
[3:10:12] <stormhawk9891> Enough with the piercing blow
[3:10:15] <bbblaketwitching> SS
[3:10:18] <Kyphen15> I think I remember using an elevator to get to him
[3:10:19] <%MonsterEnvy> @WoolieVersus Stop using Piercing Blow on 1 hp enemies with only 1 defense
[3:10:21] <%Th3SmartAlec> @guyman125 Yeah, I was being smarmy about it
[3:10:24] <Bguy32> I swear Paige would be better at this than Woolie
[3:10:27] <glass_marcus> Honestly, Piercing blow is usually not worth it
[3:10:29] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Bguy32 OOF
[3:10:29] <%MonsterEnvy> It's does nothing
[3:10:34] <%Proxzo> he's doing it
[3:10:37] <bbblaketwitching> @bguy32 let's not get crazy
[3:10:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> Just a mention, there's a difference between trying to be helpful and bitching everytime Woolie doesn't do everything perfect.

[3:10:53] <Bguy32> Yes

[3:12:15] <+Grayhammatter> it lasts a long time
[3:12:17] <+Superbro64> use items to regain fp :)
[3:12:19] <Am_Shigar00> This is definetly the worst part of the game, backtracking.
[3:12:20] <kingkeldeo31> It tells whent it runs out
[3:12:23] <CursedNobleman> he appears if you input the IS Code
[3:12:29] <Taarin> It happens more often on higher payments
[3:12:31] <Kyphen15> Happens more often when you pay more
[3:12:32] <SixthSun2> The amount paid determines the length
[3:12:35] <%mrjojothelion> that's why the more expensive stuff is worth it
[3:12:37] <%CommanderSqueaks> For Mitch Digger
[3:12:39] <vaderxyz1970> Pay 50 for Best Buff

[3:13:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> She can
[3:13:04] <Am_Shigar00> Oh god, how much do you get from the 50 coin buff if it went off on a Amazee Dazee?
[3:13:10] <%Th3SmartAlec> Reggie with the 400 IQ
[3:13:15] <Papa_Bearman> When the Koopa's on its back, it has no defense, so anything will hurt him.

[3:32:30] <KillswitchLikesToPlay> Sup @WoolieVersus
[3:32:31] <nin10play> @WoolieVersus Some Tips to know about Koops as of now. The "Counter" was because Koops has a unique attribute to him where he has a defense of 1 but it goes to 0 if an enemy jumps on him, like other Koopas. And his normal attack has 2 stylish moves, you are just mashing too fast for the second prompt to appear.
[3:32:35] <StuffHunter> They throw cans and hammers for damage, the rest are items.
[3:32:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> Not to this extent per chapter
[3:32:41] <Am_Shigar00> It's like those intermission segments from Tokyo Mirage Sessions.

[3:33:32] <+QuadraticGravity> @WoolieVersus this is the biggest influx of trouble center missions, it's usually like 3.
[3:33:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> Save that small child Woolie
[3:33:36] <CursedNobleman> howlongtobeat paper mario TTYD: 39½ Hours
[3:33:37] <+AsinPersuasion> done'
[3:33:43] <+AsinPersuasion> sell the sheep
[3:33:43] <alexandrecau> sell a sheep
[3:33:44] <+pectusumbra> oh yeah, sell your sheep!
[3:33:46] <Cynical_Canadian> Sell the sheep, rip off the nice people
[3:33:50] <%Monkeyweed21> Woolie is the only person who can make a 30 hour game last 80
[3:33:52] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> +1 DEF
[3:33:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> Sell sheep Woolie
[3:33:55] <%mrjojothelion> this is true
[3:33:59] <Am_Shigar00> Basically it's the same logic as the regular Koopas.
[3:34:00] <Cynical_Canadian> Hustle and flow!
[3:34:01] <%lewdskeletor13> I think the rest will go faster after this clean up episode
[3:34:02] <bbblaketwitching> ah, they sell mr softener here... great...
[3:34:02] <rubbishbinge> he is a koopa
[3:34:02] <CursedNobleman> @Cynical_Canadian thats not ripping them off. thats shipping costs
[3:34:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yeyeye
[3:34:07] <%Monkeyweed21> sell the sheep @WoolieVersus
[3:34:08] <+pectusumbra> sell it
[3:34:09] <+Grayhammatter> ....
[3:34:10] <shiny_prinny> he's like the enemy koopas basically, yes
[3:34:11] <guyman125> natural +1 def, same logic as regular koopas
[3:34:16] <Papa_Bearman> Just like every other koopa, when he's standing he has 1 DEF, but when he's on his back, he has 0 DEF.
[3:34:16] <%Monkeyweed21> Sell the sheep for money
[3:34:17] <Belakitu> respect the hustle
[3:34:20] <thetntm> does your storage keep between stores though?
[3:34:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> That Hoops advice went WOOSH
[3:34:26] <thetntm> because if it does then you can do it all in one trip
[3:34:27] <%MonsterEnvy> Koops is like other Koopas has a def of 1 but can be knocked on his back
[3:34:27] <+Superbro64> more reason koops is lame. Always pick best girl.
[3:34:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> I was smuggling bycicles
[3:34:28] <GodlyLuigi> Reggie if you guard the move that would knock him over he stays up
[3:34:29] <+pectusumbra> yes it's like an item box
[3:34:30] <bbblaketwitching> you can do more than one at a time
[3:34:32] <Cynical_Canadian> "Respecta da hustle!"
[3:34:32] <+AsinPersuasion> but hes selling the sheep for 20
[3:34:34] <GHouseduivel> You turning Welsh Woolie?
[3:34:38] <%GrassCannon> I don't want to know what the Peadows do with those Sleepy Sheep
[3:34:38] <Am_Shigar00> Yup
[3:34:39] <+QuadraticGravity> ye
[3:34:40] <%Monkeyweed21> yes
[3:34:41] <%mrjojothelion> yes
[3:34:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yes
[3:34:41] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> normaly
[3:34:42] <Papa_Bearman> Yes.
[3:34:42] <+TheDyingPride> yea
[3:34:43] <+AsinPersuasion> yes
[3:34:44] <%MonsterEnvy> Yes unless knocked over
[3:34:45] <Drusain> Pat would be doing the sleepy sheep hustle for 6 hours off screen
[3:34:51] <KatabolicRage> he works like a koopa trooper
[3:34:57] <Bguy32> You don't have to fight every enemy you see. these goombas don't give you any exp
[3:34:59] <+QuadraticGravity> He's super tanky but you have to active block any jump attacks
[3:34:59] <%DrStinkers> @WoolieVersus the goombas aren't giving you xp anymore
[3:35:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Drusain Coming back with 999 Coins and 50 gold bars
[3:35:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> Still mashing that button LUL
[3:35:04] <Am_Shigar00> You can actually put him in the front when fighting Spinias in the sewer and he'll just tank everything.
[3:35:06] <@Solidus_113> When you upgrade Koops he gets a good defence skill
[3:35:08] <thetntm> nice super
[3:35:08] <Taarin> Super guard PogChamp
[3:35:12] <nin10play> PogChamp Super guard!
[3:35:16] <Belakitu> PARRY
[3:35:16] <noe_juan_kanobe> Royal Release
[3:35:18] <Amardeux> shhhh just lie and say its first try LUL
[3:35:22] <bbblaketwitching> it ended
[3:35:25] <Bguy32> small stage
[3:35:28] <Papa_Bearman> No, because it's too small to get to you.
[3:35:33] <%MonsterEnvy> No just cause it was not near you
[3:35:34] <guyman125> Please skip the fights,they are not give experience to be worth it
[3:35:37] <bbblaketwitching> the battle ended and the stuff wasn't large enough
[3:35:39] <%Monkeyweed21> Woolie sell the sheep for money
[3:35:40] <+Cavumentum> At this point these battles are just for the money
[3:35:41] <Am_Shigar00> It was too tiny to hurt you
[3:35:48] <%Th3SmartAlec> .......
[3:35:53] <+Superbro64> fights DO give the same amount of Star Points though
[3:35:53] <guyman125> Thank you Reggie
[3:35:55] <kingkeldeo31> You're getting 1 exp per fight
[3:35:55] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie. This is giving you no EXP
[3:35:55] <@Solidus_113> This is Minh-tier grinding
[3:35:56] <%krispen_wa> ...so i was grinding offscreen
[3:35:58] <Zeemod155> You do not need to grind
[3:35:58] <+Cavumentum> which you could get more of via sheep hustle
[3:35:59] <nin10play> Woolie only likes grinding in private
[3:35:59] <lambishly> It's fine dude it's part of why we're here
[3:36:00] <frigglefroogle> fighting enemies is a time loss honestly for the exp you get
[3:36:00] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> 2
[3:36:00] <Papa_Bearman> Eh, it's fine.
[3:36:03] <+Rukabuk> The grind is LEARNING HOW TO STYLE. There's skill involved in this game. KILL THEM ALL!
[3:36:03] <%SvenHolgersson> The music is so endearing
[3:36:04] <bbblaketwitching> If you do want to grind, there are better places
[3:36:04] <Bguy32> This xp is worthless
[3:36:07] <%LuckyLagomorph> it's cool, man
[3:36:08] <+TheDyingPride> 2/100
[3:36:11] <%Monkeyweed21> You dont need to grind Woolie
[3:36:12] <$Superdandy96> Meh, I’m fine with it
[3:36:16] <%SvenHolgersson> Is this what people who liked FF7 felt?
[3:36:16] <bbblaketwitching> far more than one at a time
[3:36:18] <%Th3SmartAlec> 2 EXP LUL
[3:36:21] <Taarin> Every area makes sure you get adequate xp
[3:36:21] <Zeemod155> You can never do any side-quests/back-tracking and STILL be overpowered
[3:36:21] <Am_Shigar00> grinding in this game is mostly just for money and action command practice.
[3:36:22] <Kyphen15> Its cool, its been really fun watching the grind actually
[3:36:24] <SomersaultJustice> Snailper Mario!
[3:36:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> Man I really wish the 7th Stand User didn't fall apart.
[3:36:31] <%MonsterEnvy> Only 1 xp
[3:36:32] <%krispen_wa> is 7th stand user one of the only LPs Woolie's never finished?
[3:36:36] <thesickestzak> Remember JoJo?
[3:36:41] <%yeknomlive> sounds like older smt
[3:36:42] <SomersaultJustice> oh yeah, jojo, that was a thing
[3:36:45] <Daveythe6thMoon> For now, but at some point these old fights will start netting you 1 star point per fight. That's when it's best to just start avoiding them.
[3:36:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> @krispen_wa It got really rough
[3:36:54] <SomersaultJustice> look at that proto luma!
[3:36:55] <%SvenHolgersson> JoJo Siwa?
[3:36:56] <kingkeldeo31> use pow block
[3:36:57] <TeeJabs> yeah grinding aint super helpful
[3:36:57] <%MonsterEnvy> These guys are only giving you 1 xp
[3:36:57] <%Th3SmartAlec> why
[3:36:59] <bbblaketwitching> 5, nice
[3:37:03] <Am_Shigar00> I wonder what happened to that LP, that's sad to hear, I wasn't into Jojo when Woolie started it.
[3:37:05] <$Superdandy96> Jojo was fun, but good the enemy place meant was mean.
[3:37:05] <%Th3SmartAlec> But style at least
[3:37:14] <%emperordread> That JoJo game was the most fun that I didn't understand. Had no idea what was going on
[3:37:18] <%SirGO0SE> i was enjoying jojo lp anyway just for being in that universe
[3:37:19] <BreakersAweigh> yeah its best to start avoiding battles when you're getting 1-2 exp each
[3:37:20] <BlackMage66652> @WoolieVersus You got 1 xp for all of that
[3:37:22] <kingkeldeo31> Literally wasted 5 FP
[3:37:22] <+HyperCharge_Sam> 1exp for 5 enemies
[3:37:22] <Amardeux> yikes
[3:37:23] <%Th3SmartAlec> 1 EXP
[3:37:24] <%SirGO0SE> but i get all the reasons you stoppd
[3:37:26] <+Euphbugg> 1 EXP
[3:37:34] <bbblaketwitching> you could have avoided that, just saying
[3:37:34] <%krispen_wa> 7th Stand User has some REALLY hype fanservice, but yeah the gameplay was pretty garbo
[3:37:42] <%MonsterEnvy> Goomba's are not longer worth it pretty much
[3:37:44] <shiny_prinny> enemies give less star points as you level up to
[3:37:44] <+pectusumbra> that's how the game anti-grinds you
[3:37:46] <bbblaketwitching> not the end of the world, but it is an option
[3:37:49] <%iHum4n> 5 for 0, then they give you a pity xp
[3:37:50] <%SvenHolgersson> I never had to grind in this game its one of the reasons its so good
[3:37:50] <+greenfall> mostly practice for action command i guess
[3:37:54] <judgemailman> You get less exp for easier enemies as you level up
[3:37:57] <Solidnick18> ooooh
[3:37:57] <+Euphbugg> the leveling scale in this game makes is so you don't need to farm much at all
[3:37:57] <Am_Shigar00> @krispen_wa Would you say it's better as more of an experience than as an actual game?
[3:37:59] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[3:37:59] <nin10play> Actually they didn't give you any EXP, but the game makes it so that you always get 1 EXP after a battle
[3:38:00] <%bread_assassin> Did that LP ever finish?
[3:38:02] <grimshuck> I wonder how long it's going take from him to realise he's mashing Koops' stylish
[3:38:03] <bbblaketwitching> time for the PITTTT
[3:38:07] <%Monkeyweed21> its made for people who dont take 5 minutes per random battle
[3:38:09] <Solidnick18> @bread_assassin nope
[3:38:10] <skyheys> dragon quest isn't anywhere near that grindy
[3:38:10] <%Th3SmartAlec> @bbblaketwitching Not yet
[3:38:11] <+Superbro64> reminder that though the enemies ARENT worth it for exp, they ARE worth it for building Star Point pips
[3:38:15] <%kyh9> What game?
[3:38:19] <Taarin> You will eventually stop getting even 1 exp after you level
[3:38:25] <%kyh9> Which game???
[3:38:26] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts

[3:38:30] <Am_Shigar00> I just beat through Dragon Quest 1-4 this year, and they can get pretty grinding, but never THAT bad.
[3:38:31] <bbblaketwitching> @th3smartalec na, we're going to the bottom rn
[3:38:32] <+pectusumbra> gotta deliever
[3:38:33] <nin10play> @Taarin Oh really?

[3:38:42] <jubejube56> I feel like grinding in Octopath Traveler was the worst it ever got for me
[3:38:42] <$Superdandy96> I always thought they should’ve went the earthbound route, but meh, what are you gonna do
[3:38:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> And then right back to the Pedo Meadow
[3:38:46] <BlackMage66652> @Superbro64 Star Points ARE xp

[3:39:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> @bbblaketwitching He needs Chapter 2 thing
[3:39:26] <bbblaketwitching> not that its actually viable or anything
[3:39:30] <thetntm> the game wasn't built for this
[3:39:35] <Solidnick18> lol
[3:39:37] <Amardeux> LUL
[3:39:37] <%MonsterEnvy> It's so you don't have to hold them all at once.

[3:41:34] <+AsinPersuasion> its an elixir
[3:41:36] <Darren716> Just hold on to it
[3:41:36] <+AsinPersuasion> yeah
[3:41:37] <Taarin> It's not worth it, you can get more later
[3:41:37] <+AsinPersuasion> totally
[3:41:37] <Bguy32> Dont cook it
[3:41:37] <mobius_won> “Oh god I’m so lonely” - The Mayor
[3:41:38] <BlackMage66652> NotLikeThis
[3:41:38] <SixthSun2> That's fair
[3:41:39] <Am_Shigar00> Honestly selling it wouldn't be bad if he doesn't plan on getting that much HP.
[3:41:39] <Darren716> Youll need it
[3:41:40] <%MonsterEnvy> Ultra Shoom was worth 200 in the store
[3:41:40] <jackarrow1> Store the ultra shroom
[3:41:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Daveythe6thMoon Underground depot sells it for 200
[3:41:43] <+AsinPersuasion> nah just sell it for now
[3:41:45] <%mrjojothelion> Selling it is a good idea too
[3:41:45] <qsirius> but partners tho
[3:41:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> Save the UltraShroom for later.
[3:41:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> Store it
[3:41:51] <Daveythe6thMoon> Eh, no matter. He'll find more later.
[3:41:51] <+HyperCharge_Sam> you can get to the end of the game and never even have 50hp
[3:41:53] <SiegeJay> Cook the Ultra Shroom with Zess T for STONKS
[3:41:53] <skyheys> SELL IT!
[3:41:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> Store it for later
[3:41:58] <Solidnick18> or you need money
[3:41:59] <bbblaketwitching> do as you will
[3:42:00] <Belakitu> Its a megapotion more than an elixir
[3:42:03] <+VorpalSlash> By the time they're worth it you can afford them anyway
[3:42:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> POCKETS
[3:42:07] <Am_Shigar00> Nah, you're good. Depending on your build you may never get that much HP.
[3:42:08] <thesickestzak> But what if you do need it eventually
[3:42:08] <Leddy_at_Home> GREED
[3:42:09] <bbblaketwitching> unless I say otherwise, of course
[3:42:10] <%GrassCannon> LINE THOSE POCKETS
[3:42:11] <Merlow> Ultra Shrooms are divine
[3:42:11] <+Grayhammatter> paper POCKETS
[3:42:12] <+AsinPersuasion> the final boss is actually very hard in this game
[3:42:12] <thesickestzak> WHAT IF
[3:42:13] <nin10play> Cooking it isn't that bad. It becomes an item that heals 30 HP and 15 FP I think
[3:42:13] <%DatAsuna> or just throw it away
[3:42:15] <+AsinPersuasion> like tons of incoming damage
[3:42:16] <%Monkeyweed21> then invest and get 300 coins
[3:42:16] <arkv01> get PAID
[3:42:18] <%Irridium> fuck you pay me
[3:42:18] <@Menitta> just use it NOW
[3:42:19] <Papa_Bearman> He could cook it with a Jammin' Jelly to make a Jelly Ultra.
[3:42:19] <Taarin> Exactly Reggie
[3:42:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> It costs 100
[3:42:21] <%SvenHolgersson> HOW BIG ARE THE POCKETS ON THOSE OVERALLS
[3:42:22] <@Menitta> Kappa
[3:42:22] <Solidnick18> it's early game tho
[3:42:23] <kingkeldeo31> You won't
[3:42:25] <%MonsterEnvy> You will get money once you move in teh chapters
[3:42:26] <stormhawk9891> You're not getting 50 hp, not if you want bp and fp
[3:42:29] <%mrjojothelion> f o o t s i e s
[3:42:29] <%SvenHolgersson> THEY LOOK DEEEEEEEEEEEP
[3:42:29] <%Monkeyweed21> If you want money then invest
[3:42:30] <Merlow> Cooking it in your state wouldn't be bad
[3:42:31] <%SirGO0SE> by the time you have that hp youll have other ways to regen hp, sell that shit and invest it
[3:42:35] <nin10play> Sells for 50
[3:42:35] <%DatAsuna> just throw it away
[3:42:35] <alexandrecau> You already have the money
[3:42:36] <Papa_Bearman> Depends on the shop.
[3:42:36] <+arcielardor> this is the saga of Pockets the Plumber

[3:49:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> Woolie has already decided to ignore rat forever
[3:49:51] <+AsinPersuasion> storage is 32 items isn't it? so 64
[3:49:53] <CursedNobleman> @bbblaketwitching he reformatted that part of his brain to make room for SICK DMC COMBOS
[3:49:57] <luckysteak> get rid of that multibounce trash! (exaggeration)
[3:49:59] <Egoangell> buy badges NOWWWWW
[3:50:01] <frigglefroogle> soft stomp is sellable, not worth it imo

[3:50:25] <+Grayhammatter> sell the shroom
[3:50:25] <bbblaketwitching> @cursednobleman I believe that so hard, and I'm still oh so sad
[3:50:28] <KatabolicRage> flog the shroom man you won't need it forever
[3:50:29] <thetntm> Woolie you can store infinite sheep and retreive them in the peadows
[3:50:30] <nin10play> @tttruest No they don't even know it exists yet
[3:50:32] <+IceyCone> cook the fire flower c:
[3:50:38] <%Th3SmartAlec> ........
[3:50:39] <stormhawk9891> Cook the leaf?
[3:50:39] <Papa_Bearman> You can cook the Fire Flower, but that turns it into an HP/FP restore instead of an attack.
[3:50:40] <Daveythe6thMoon> If you're gonna sell badges best to wait til later. Really accrue a big collection of badges and make one hecc of a profit.
[3:50:40] <%mrjojothelion> cook the fire flower
[3:50:40] <+TheDyingPride> sell shroom or store it
[3:50:47] <nin10play> Flower makes soup
[3:50:49] <KatabolicRage> by all means sell the thing, it's just a healing item
[3:50:50] <tttruest> @nin10play hype
[3:50:50] <@Solidus_113> nah sell it
[3:50:51] <frigglefroogle> sell the shroom if you want, youre not gonna use it
[3:50:52] <CursedNobleman> @bbblaketwitching if you want to level yourself while gaming, you gotta delete less important things after all
[3:50:53] <time_axis> it wasnt really "everyone"
[3:50:53] <+pectusumbra> I mean you could grind out 20 coins right now
[3:50:55] <redmage216> rat is limited time option
[3:50:57] <%Th3SmartAlec> store it or sell it
[3:50:59] <SideChar> but that oil rat tho?
[3:51:01] <+pectusumbra> 50 isn't worth it
[3:51:05] <kingkeldeo31> Leaf
[3:51:06] <shiny_prinny> even if you sold the ultra, you could always grind money and buy more
[3:51:06] <Taarin> Buy the shroom, cook it and sell the dish
[3:51:06] <%yeknomlive> the cook was so nice in the first game :<

[3:53:39] <+Superbro64> TIME TO SELL SOME SHEEP
[3:53:40] <chikubihime> can you cook the mystery?
[3:53:40] <+AsinPersuasion> people were saying not to
[3:53:45] <Am_Shigar00> Is HP Plus worth it? You could just level HP up if you feel you need more.
[3:53:45] <guyman125> you aren't doing a peril run so sell the mega rush
[3:53:46] <+paladinstarbuster> just wait
[3:53:48] <MrRavine> Timing Tutor DansGame
[3:53:49] <@Solidus_113> just sell the shroom
[3:53:49] <Papa_Bearman> I've never, ever used Soft Stomp.
[3:53:50] <%DrStinkers> just sell anything other than ultra shroom
[3:53:51] <alwayschilling > Sell shroom, there are tons of heading items coming up
[3:53:53] <kingkeldeo31> Multibounce sucks
[3:53:56] <%Struggleful> Hustle Hard
[3:53:59] <%Th3SmartAlec> @grimshuck no. I need to keep it clogging up my inventory
[3:54:01] <Warbot40> Piercing really isn't that useful
[3:54:01] <%krispen_wa> Just sell everything
[3:54:10] <%yeknomlive> how many of those super shrooms are in the game
[3:54:11] <+AsinPersuasion> chat with the shit opinions now lmao
[3:54:15] <falyden> I love how we haven't even started chapter 2 yet
[3:54:17] <+AsinPersuasion> pierce is great
[3:54:18] <BlackMage66652> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:54:20] <bbblaketwitching> the people who don't want you to sell the shroom are the ones who have 30 elixirs at the end of their games
[3:54:20] <%GrassCannon> You won't need the Shroom if you just learn to Royal Guard 4Head
[3:54:23] <+AsinPersuasion> multi bounce scales even better
[3:54:24] <+Superbro64> reminder that the badge shop has a another set of badges to sell
[3:54:24] <@Solidus_113> there are more than enough healing items you can collect, you don't need a single 50
[3:54:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> @bbblaketwitching Fucking PROBLEM!?
[3:54:31] <Am_Shigar00> @Warbot40 Pierce can be useful against certain later enemies, but yeah, not too big right now.
[3:54:32] <%DensityD> yes yes
[3:54:33] <+AsinPersuasion> because jump eventually does 4
[3:54:34] <%mrjojothelion> good move
[3:54:36] <nin10play> @Warbot40 There are Clefts in the next 2 chapters. Piercing Blow is amazing
[3:54:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> Why you calling me out like that?
[3:54:45] <%Th3SmartAlec> correct
[3:54:48] <guyman125> Hp up is just turning a bp level into an hp level
[3:54:49] <%Jetzord> @Warbot40 Pierce is fantastic once you get to the later enemies and the badge taht reduces FP use
[3:54:50] <bbblaketwitching> @commandersqueaks yes, your existence and opinions. they're bad
[3:55:00] <%Monkeyweed21> You aren't good at this game so dont bother with Peril badges
[3:55:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> @bbblaketwitching Next you'll say Pat is neurotic.
[3:55:10] <+pectusumbra> Again, it'd be fine to sell, but there's literally a trick that lets you get 20 coins a run, so 50 isn't that much
[3:55:11] <thetntm> piercing blow is very helpful
[3:55:20] <Taarin> "What if I need my 10 ultra shrooms before the final boss"
[3:55:24] <SomersaultJustice> I only saw one of those FF6 limits in my entire life
[3:55:26] <+TheDyingPride> isn't peril runs the key in speedruns?
[3:55:28] <BlackMage66652> Woolie's Mind Goblins have activated
[3:55:28] <Calek> oh thankgoodness he didn't buy FP Drain
[3:55:31] <+AsinPersuasion> its 1/8th health and a fight has to last like 3 minutes
[3:55:35] <%Th3SmartAlec> RIP RatCoin
[3:55:37] <%DensityD> is there any way this UI could be better?
[3:55:42] <strifer413> oh shit woolie needs to play ff6 someday maybe
[3:55:46] <kingkeldeo31> F for Rat
[3:55:49] <Am_Shigar00> If there are any skills you don't really use, might as well take them off.
[3:55:49] <nin10play> You mean FF 8?
[3:55:53] <+AsinPersuasion> they're called desperation attacks
[3:55:57] <Rhinoprotoss> FF6 encounter rate is fucked
[3:55:57] <%yeknomlive> no ff6 did have hidden limit breaks
[3:55:58] <+AsinPersuasion> nope
[3:56:02] <SomersaultJustice> He'll probably play X-2 first
[3:56:03] <glass_marcus> Take of pierce
[3:56:08] <Warbot40> Man I miss good Mario RPGs...
[3:56:08] <Leddy_at_Home> Peril Strats are for people that know this game inside out, so don't feel bad for not using them.
[3:56:08] <%yeknomlive> not practical at all but cool
[3:56:14] <bbblaketwitching> @commandersqueaks na, clearly pat is a very sane role model we should all aspire to <3
[3:56:16] <%Monkeyweed21> you dont use power bounce
[3:56:17] <+ShazBo2000> HOW THE HELL WOOLIE NEVWR PLAYED FFVI Aka FF III on sens
[3:56:20] <%vaporousTippler> You can also play FF6 with two players. Technically.
[3:56:20] <kingkeldeo31> Get rid of pirece
[3:56:22] <+AsinPersuasion> they're insanely hard to trigger
[3:56:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> @bbblaketwitching Clearly!
[3:56:24] <frigglefroogle> multibounce can go off
[3:56:25] <Self_esteampunk> ff6 is so good
[3:56:26] <+Superbro64> ryu's shoryu super has a special animation and does more damage at low health in mvci
[3:56:27] <bbblaketwitching> I love you you crazy gremlin
[3:56:30] <%yeknomlive> ff6 is great
[3:56:30] <%mrjojothelion> that's good
[3:56:30] <frigglefroogle> you only do 1 damage
[3:56:34] <Taarin> Danger mario is for those who are super guarding everything in the game
[3:56:35] <bevyrage> i knew about it because i got into a real bad spot on the first playthrough and the ninja pulled off his low health limit break too
[3:56:36] <Am_Shigar00> I need to beat FF6 at some point.
[3:56:37] <+ShazBo2000> FF6 is only the greatest Final Fantasy
[3:56:40] <%ChoculaUltra> didn't all of Sabin's desperation moves also use fighting game inputs too? So you could fuck up majorly?

[3:58:08] <CrmznOgre> woolie what's on your shirt?
[3:58:08] <Papa_Bearman> Oh, I stepped out - we're done tonight?
[3:58:10] <+pectusumbra> synch test for the recording
[3:58:10] <+Superbro64> what IS the legal age in rogueport?
[3:58:11] <+hawk_rush> @Jflaskd13 editing purposes
[3:58:11] <NotHereToStream> gg good sesh
[3:58:11] <Cynical_Canadian> Mood lighting
[3:58:12] <BigManLugan> this is a killer lp, Woolie
[3:58:12] <GHouseduivel> @Jflaskd13 Syncing audio
[3:58:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Jflaskd13 To help Minh sync the audio and video
[3:58:14] <Papa_Bearman> That's cool. G'night, boys.
[3:58:14] <%ChoculaUltra> its a sync test for editting/recording
[3:58:16] <%SchwaAkari> I'm going to need to watch every single vod of this thing
[3:58:17] <thetntm> it's to help sync the audio recording
[3:58:20] <bbblaketwitching> That was a chunk of content
[3:58:24] <+Superbro64> is there even an authoritative body to enforce such rules?
[3:58:24] <%SchwaAkari> I can hardly believe this is being played here
[3:58:29] <missingangle> We didn't get to chapter 2 yet, guys? I joined like ten mins ago. Not complaining at all, though, it just means more Woolie streams :3
[3:58:32] <Jaller101514> nice season!
[3:58:32] <Cynical_Canadian> CHapter 2 is quite hefty
[3:58:36] <%SvenHolgersson> This is quite a hearty game
[3:58:38] <Jflaskd13> thx doodBro
[3:58:41] <%ChoculaUltra> @WoolieVersus please tell me you added the invadervie cod montage to the outro
[3:58:44] <+AsinPersuasion> he was side questin
[3:58:48] <Darren716> Well howlong to beat is normal time
[3:58:51] <Darren716> Not lp time
[3:58:52] <ultimatemegahero1> Is this going up on YouTube?
[3:58:52] <+QuadraticGravity> @WoolieVersus this is the biggest single dump of sidequests they hand you at the trouble center, if you're worried about LP
[3:58:54] <+Superbro64> post chapter side plots take a bit for sure
[3:58:57] <Calek> hope het gets quickswap next session
[3:58:58] <%SvenHolgersson> 30 hours at least
[3:59:01] <+GustusWarlock> god I cant wait for the slog that is glitzville
[3:59:09] <%SchwaAkari> Thanks for the awesome stream Woolz and Reggie <3
[3:59:12] <Papa_Bearman> This game is meaty. There's eight chapters.
[3:59:15] <%DatAsuna> @svenholgersson 30 hours is the mainline only time
[3:59:21] <thesickestzak> Just never stop playing. Reggie can't go home :)
[3:59:22] <nin10play> @GustusWarlock You take that back, Glitzville is the best
[3:59:24] <%DatAsuna> this way?
[3:59:25] <bbblaketwitching> this is going up after the kotor anime is over yeah?
[3:59:27] <+QuadraticGravity> After future chapters you only get like 3
[3:59:28] <%emeraldskrull> woolieDATTEBAYO woolieTRASH woolieDATTEBAYO_HF
[3:59:30] <+GustusWarlock> make me
[3:59:30] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:59:30] <%DatAsuna> probably 50 houra
[3:59:31] <missingangle> seems fair
[3:59:35] <bbblaketwitching> backlog
[3:59:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> @QuadraticGravity Fucking hero
[3:59:36] <+hawk_rush> someone should let them know about the ??? sidequset
[3:59:38] <+pectusumbra> It's cause you get prologue and chapter 1 quests
[3:59:39] <shiny_prinny> there are longer and more complex sidequests, though
[3:59:41] <+hawk_rush> that should be done on stream
[3:59:47] <missingangle> If it helps, we wouldn't mind at all
[3:59:51] <Daveythe6thMoon> "Hit me, Mario!"
[3:59:54] <%SirGO0SE> do em on stream we love it <3
[4:00:01] <+QuadraticGravity> @CommanderSqueaks ive been lookin stuff up this whole time but just keeping it in for post-recording
[4:00:01] <gilgatwitcher> Nah, do em on stream.
[4:00:02] <bbblaketwitching> this has all been pretty great
[4:00:03] <shiny_prinny> either way it'sfun
[4:00:05] <%DukeBlack_> fuck the other guys
[4:00:06] <ashenjuan25> Reggie the consular?
[4:00:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> I don't think anyone here had a problem with the side quests. Can't speak for the Anime audience, but the Manga audience loves it.
[4:00:11] <+Grayhammatter> do what you want my dude
[4:00:12] <%0ctaeder> will there be a lp where reggie will play the game?
[4:00:13] <%SirGO0SE> please us we want it all baby
[4:00:15] <%DatAsuna> i'm the latter
[4:00:15] <+greenfall> im for the side stuff
[4:00:18] <+TheDyingPride> you did 3 dumps worth of quests at once
[4:00:19] <missingangle> To be honest, TTYD fans have no problem because we just love more content
[4:00:19] <%krispen_wa> if all the sidequests are like those, it's fine
[4:00:20] <DragonSpooker> Nah this was a great sess
[4:00:21] <Bguy32> The next chapter is the worst one buts all up hill from there
[4:00:24] <sunnythedrunk> No the sidequests are awesome
[4:00:24] <+Loinclothiclese> SEE IT
[4:00:27] <%SvenHolgersson> DO ALL OF IT
[4:00:30] <%kyh9> Show it to us
[4:00:31] <nin10play> Fuck those other guys who said that wall is easy to notice
[4:00:31] <Solidnick18> it's fun i like it
[4:00:32] <%SvenHolgersson> 100% OR NOTHING
[4:00:34] <+QuadraticGravity> I'm mostly excited for you getting really into the battle system
[4:00:35] <GHouseduivel> We need to learn about CRIME port
[4:00:35] <Darren716> Do it all on stream, maybe cut for the lp?
[4:00:37] <%SvenHolgersson> BUT THAT GAME WAS STINKY
[4:00:37] <nyacoo> Definitely don't mind
[4:00:38] <+pectusumbra> Little Devil!
[4:00:38] <%krispen_wa> KOWASHITAI
[4:00:38] <%DatAsuna> remember when pat said yakuza would be no sidequests?
[4:00:39] <+hawk_rush> #13000
[4:00:41] <bbblaketwitching> The only thing bad is the extra fight on the way to the things
[4:00:41] <shiny_prinny> the writing is so great it's def worth it
[4:00:41] <%ChoculaUltra> sbfpBlue
[4:00:41] <luckysteak> #FE13000
[4:00:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> this game is NOT Tokyo Mirage session.
[4:00:42] <SomersaultJustice> why not? #13000FE
[4:00:43] <Bguy32> #13000
[4:00:43] <+paladinstarbuster> 13000FE
[4:00:44] <%Chatterbox1991> NO DO IT THOUGH
[4:00:45] <%prime_name> #130000
[4:00:45] <%DukeBlack_> TMS is entirely different it's a game in Japanese
[4:00:46] <@Solidus_113> Double blind is a dangerous LP game
[4:00:47] <Megafang2145> Side stuff is good if you wanna do it
[4:00:48] <%iHum4n> I don't mind joining the 13000 again
[4:00:49] <skyheys> this game is actually good, so nobody minds
[4:00:49] <%KyoryUtchy> Has Woolie learned about The Pit of Bloody Palace yet?
[4:00:50] <%DatAsuna> yashiro's dad did nothing wrong
[4:00:50] <Solidnick18> as long as everyone like its
[4:00:51] <%SirGO0SE> 13000 gang
[4:00:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> #13000
[4:00:51] <Darren716> This game doesnt drag like TMS
[4:00:52] <Daveythe6thMoon> TTYD fans have been waiting for years for Nintendo to make another fun Paper Mario game. They know how to be patient!
[4:00:52] <phatmac16> #13000 FE
[4:00:53] <BreakersAweigh> #13000FE
[4:00:53] <%krispen_wa> #13000
[4:00:54] <jaid251> The best lp
[4:00:54] <nin10play> Ok but I watched all of Tokyo Mirage Sessions
[4:00:56] <+QuadraticGravity> #13000FE
[4:00:58] <Poryizard> It’s fine to do it but your grind is slow in between
[4:01:00] <%DatAsuna> kowashitai
[4:01:00] <i_am_therydon> #13000
[4:01:02] <sunnythedrunk> #13000
[4:01:05] <zeif00> Maybe some mitigation would be nice
[4:01:05] <thesickestzak> The #13000
[4:01:06] <%SuperKirby24> #13000
[4:01:09] <DragonSpooker> Oof
[4:01:09] <Darren716> Woolie this game isnt a hardcore jrpg
[4:01:12] <ashenjuan25> Damn
[4:01:18] <Daveythe6thMoon> But hey Bug Fables exists so I can stop waiting!
[4:01:20] <+GustusWarlock> someone has made a kinda paper mario type game recently
[4:01:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> This game isn't even close to that much of a slog.
[4:01:24] <+Superbro64> believe me, I doubt ANYTHING in TTYD is as bad as it gets in #FE
[4:01:26] <+paladinstarbuster> MAMORI IS GONNA LOSE HER COOLS
[4:01:26] <Darren716> Like its a paper mario game, it aint too complex
[4:01:28] <sunnythedrunk> This game is nowhere close to that long at all
[4:01:28] <bbblaketwitching> what is #13000?
[4:01:30] <+Superbro64> EXCEPT THAT ONE BIT
[4:01:33] <%SirGO0SE> i real talked LOOOOVED the tms lp
[4:01:35] <+GustusWarlock> yeah what davey said
[4:01:39] <Cynical_Canadian> I agree with Woolie, as funny as the joke is, his channel isn't big enough for that
[4:01:39] <+Superbro64> THAT ONE BIT IN TTYD IS rough
[4:01:40] <CalliegulaStrems> I am a proud member of The 13000 FE
[4:01:40] <bbblaketwitching> also bug fables isn't thaaaat good
[4:01:41] <%DatAsuna> #the13000FE
[4:01:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> @bbblaketwitching The average number of views they had for each episode of it.
[4:01:45] <bbblaketwitching> its fiiiiine
[4:01:45] <+天使42199> Yeah thousand year door isnt anywhere near as long
[4:01:47] <%Emperor_Machinus> But Barry though
[4:01:49] <sunnythedrunk> TMS was one of the best LP's #13000
[4:01:49] <%ChoculaUltra> you want sidequests that leave you feeling drained and empty? Try Xenoblade Chronicles.
[4:01:50] <nin10play> Barry Goodman wants the new Mamori doll
[4:01:51] <+天使42199> thats not gonna happen woolie dont worry
[4:01:52] <bbblaketwitching> I see ty
[4:02:02] <@Solidus_113> Yakuza is the same way
[4:02:06] <Darren716> Woolie trust me theres no where near that much in TTYD
[4:02:08] <+pectusumbra> NEver forget The Tunnel Home
[4:02:10] <Cynical_Canadian> @ChoculaUltra Yeah, that one is ALL fetch quests
[4:02:11] <%DatAsuna> TMS has some great sideauest cutscenes
[4:02:20] <%SirGO0SE> this is paper mario though, people love it enough to watch anything it has
[4:02:26] <JetpackMcQuack> SeemsGood
[4:02:26] <vaderxyz1970> This game is not that though
[4:02:32] <%DatAsuna> if only some kind of asuna made an abridged version of the LP
[4:02:34] <Daveythe6thMoon> Either which way Bug Fables scratched an itch that hasn't been satisfied in years, that alone makes me happy.
[4:02:35] <+paladinstarbuster> Never forget "MY Comlex"
[4:02:37] <Rhinoprotoss> Paper Mario is actually a good game
[4:02:38] <ashenjuan25> Is there a best of on the channel?
[4:02:42] <+Disgrea> Basically as long as you dont go out of your way to fight every enemy in previous areas TTYD is not a slog
[4:02:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> @DatAsuna If only.
[4:02:56] <Bguy32> No grinding necessary here
[4:03:02] <%ChoculaUltra> @Cynical_Canadian it doesn't help that literally 90% of them are just checklists from literal no-name npcs for the ENTIRE game
[4:03:04] <Daveythe6thMoon> Heck yeah, if Woolie hasn't played Paper Mario N64 that's a big recommend!
[4:03:09] <%DatAsuna> @commandersqueaks lowkey I hate that it got over 13000 views lol
[4:03:14] <GHouseduivel> It's Mario, not some anime bullshit though
[4:03:19] <+pectusumbra> It helps that Paper Mario doesn't need grinding and the battle system is active and fun
[4:03:21] <%SirGO0SE> yall been killing this LP so far it would take active work to scare people away lol
[4:03:31] <thesickestzak> Yeah you really don't need to grind. Just fight the enemies once on your first time through and you will be fine
[4:03:39] <missingangle> If that's what you wanna do, that's all good, Woolie. Your stream, dude!
[4:03:42] <Darren716> Trust me Woolie, you wont need to off screen really anything
[4:03:42] <%DatAsuna> grind is very unneeded
[4:04:02] <%SvenHolgersson> This game RULES
[4:04:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> @DatAsuna That's not uncommon. I see a lot of compilation creators get uncomfortable when their compilation gets more than the actual LP.
[4:04:05] <+pectusumbra> Fun indeed
[4:04:06] <DragonSpooker> @woolieversus do you know about the Gundam Vs. Maxi Boost beta?
[4:04:08] <luckysteak> You guys are doing great!

[4:06:18] <falyden> prioritize the interesting characters?
[4:06:19] <%illtima> Wools, would you consider using Save Editors or something along those lines to cut on grind for LPs?
[4:06:21] <%SirGO0SE> !throat at risk!
[4:06:21] <thesickestzak> That is something you could do off screen and if you think it is funny bring it up during the next session
[4:06:30] <SideChar> talk only to your favorite npcs
[4:06:31] <Amardeux> or just screen cap it LUL
[4:06:31] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:06:38] <sunnythedrunk> You don't have to do the voices maybe

[4:06:46] <bbblaketwitching> I believe in your expert throating ability Woolie! <3
[4:06:49] <Bguy32> That dialogue is so good though
[4:06:53] <nin10play> I don't think every single NPC has new dialogue after each chapter
[4:06:54] <%DensityD> woolie stop pleasuring yourself
[4:06:58] <%DatAsuna> @illtima there's no need, there's no level grinding in ttyd, he just wants to see every sidequests dialogue
[4:07:04] <Calek> 6k players last I saw

[4:07:12] <Amardeux> yeah but more eyeballs are on it since its on Steam
[4:07:13] <+aishman> Yeah you still have to use Origin
[4:07:15] <ashenjuan25> Titanfall 3 when?
[4:07:18] <%DatAsuna> siege is a similar deal

[4:09:15] <+TheOneCalledRock> BOTW rules
[4:09:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> If you don't have the recipe, she'll fuck it up, once you give her the recip,e she won't fuck it up.
[4:09:18] <+CharredChord> horsetails
[4:09:20] <bbblaketwitching> horsetail
[4:09:20] <+pectusumbra> mushroom always gives stir fry, leaf gives tea, ect
[4:09:25] <+QuadraticGravity> she only ever fails if you give her wrong recipes, or 50% chance if you cook a mystery
[4:09:39] <@Menitta> YES AND ITS SICK AS FUCK
[4:09:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> No, you need a RECIPE BOOK for other items, like the Horsetail.
[4:09:58] <@Menitta> Its a team fighting game for sure
[4:10:05] <%ChoculaUltra> its still 2 v 2 iirc
[4:10:06] <%YakumoYomi> Extreme VS has been out in the West for a while, though.
[4:10:07] <thesickestzak> Always cook dried shrooms. Turns them into a mistake and that is better
[4:10:09] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus Tonight the Titanfall 2 player base was around 10k when I got off 20 minutes ago. Dude it felt so good only having to wait a minute at most for a match.
[4:10:10] <Giothegame> I mean it is a part of Anime EVO
[4:10:20] <Daveythe6thMoon> It's good, he'll figure it out. Besides it's gonna be a while before he gets to the area with the cookbook, let alone the quest that nets him it.
[4:10:23] <%DensityD> I'M STILL SEEING KOOPS BOBBING REFLECTION
[4:10:33] <@Menitta> @YakumoYomi Extreme Vs hasn't been. Just Gundam Vs on PS4 which is a terrible version of the Vs games

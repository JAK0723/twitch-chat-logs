[0:05:24] <%RioGascar> when it comes out its a question of whats the music gonna be
[0:05:25] <Ner234> This remix is godlike
[0:05:43] <@Squdnate> Doot doot, it's time for BOOMER
[0:05:44] <%RioGascar> Cause I actually didnt like much of jojos music outside of ops for awhile
[0:05:46] <MayorRev> high quality
[0:05:48] <jorniev> time to watch the WOOL SLAYER
[0:05:49] <$Punisher7771> so is it ending
[0:05:55] <%Kriss1827> whats up chat!
[0:05:58] <jorniev> starting
[0:06:02] <GRIMMSORA> fair enough
[0:06:05] <+CrystalLakeWasJusASetback> Is Woolie just full anime now? No hint of Western culture left?
[0:06:09] <ihateyouo> WOOL SLAYER is great
[0:06:12] <RadicalWeegee> We in dis now bois
[0:06:14] <+NecDW4> Welcome to Hell, Woolie! Do you feel like a hero yet?
[0:06:25] <RandomDudeDave> Yo, this mashup hits
[0:06:29] <+admiral_of_crunch> Doom is pretty west, as far as games go
[0:06:32] <%RioGascar> He’s literally about to play probably the most western game
[0:06:37] <+CrystalLakeWasJusASetback> DJames is spinning in his grave.
[0:06:55] <BusterRepukken> will Woolie stop running up to demons to melee them
[0:07:06] <%Grayhammatter> prolly not
[0:07:12] <%RioGascar> the game encourages it
[0:07:12] <GRIMMSORA> excuse me while I go re watch all of Jojos after the stream
[0:07:13] <%Solidnick18> no
[0:07:15] <Personified134> pepeD
[0:07:18] <%RioGascar> in its design
[0:07:21] <+wolfhaley1331> This is the prefect game for Woolie to work out all that religious baggage
[0:07:24] <MayorRev> come on and slam
[0:07:34] <BusterRepukken> @RioGascar no it encourages glory kills, i mean meleeing full health demons
[0:07:35] <+CrystalLakeWasJusASetback> and welcome to japan
[0:07:36] <+dj_berserk_ix> Simps mad x24
[0:07:46] <BusterRepukken> meleeing does next to no damage on the bigger demons
[0:07:55] <jorniev> woolie vs satan
[0:07:59] <%RioGascar> it does encourage getting in tho
[0:08:07] <ihateyouo> i cant wait for him to fight a baron of hell
[0:08:09] <%RioGascar> it discourages ranged and especially standing still
[0:08:16] <%Grayhammatter> never stop going in
[0:08:16] <BusterRepukken> yeah but going to melee a hell knight means you die
[0:08:27] <BusterRepukken> at least shoot them first
[0:08:28] <+wolfhaley1331> Gotta have good neutral movement
[0:08:28] <%RioGascar> well then melee better
[0:08:28] <@Squdnate> It encourages RIP N TEAR
[0:08:32] <fist_wizard_jay> Aw fuck Im late
[0:08:32] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:08:33] <%RioGascar> or have a chainsaw
[0:08:36] <+kira2993> So how close is Woolie to BFG Division?
[0:08:38] <jorniev> YEAAAAAAH
[0:08:41] <dapperskeleton69> how far in is woolie?
[0:08:41] <%Irridium> man MvC 3's ost was great
[0:08:46] <+LastHazzerd> SourPls
[0:08:50] <jorniev> MAN THIS ONE SONG
[0:08:56] <+admiral_of_crunch> Woolie will have to get better at shooting to discourage ineffectual melee, and I don't see that happening. That lock-on melee is going to stick around.
[0:08:58] <dapperskeleton69> and is woolie doing any secret hunting
[0:08:58] <fist_wizard_jay> Oh shit nvm Im right on time! SWEET
[0:09:03] <%chitwhin> woolieGASM
[0:09:07] <EndgameContent> I heard the JoJo stuff while listening to the Spec Ops LP and thought it was edited in over copyrighted music
[0:09:08] <@Squdnate> He's like 1/4 in
[0:09:14] <@Squdnate> Not that far
[0:09:16] <+LastHazzerd> You gotta love them smooth vocals
[0:09:16] <fist_wizard_jay> SATURDAY NIGHT SLAYING
[0:09:16] <ihateyouo> SUPER SHOTGUN THIS STREAM
[0:09:17] <EndgameContent> It was...a bit inappropriate for the scene.
[0:09:28] <BusterRepukken> You can melee the zombies and maybe imps fine, but anything above those, just shoot
[0:09:32] <jorniev> is there an upgrade to melee?
[0:09:36] <%RioGascar> i dont think super shotty is until half way through
[0:09:37] <dapperskeleton69> has woolie gotten into hell yet and heard about THE FIRST AGE
[0:09:40] <BusterRepukken> No
[0:09:46] <+admiral_of_crunch> Not to damage, no
[0:09:51] <GRIMMSORA> hype
[0:09:51] <%Solidnick18> the time is upon us
[0:09:52] <+admiral_of_crunch> Range tho, yeah
[0:09:53] <jorniev> DAAM MAN I WANNA MELEEE
[0:09:55] <BusterRepukken> in Eternal however, you get a super punch which does gib bigger enemies so
[0:09:55] <Saltmeisterr> waddup peeps
[0:09:59] <$Punisher7771> it is time to summon him

[0:17:16] <Ryan1016> Nope it didnt
[0:17:17] <%Solidnick18> not that i remember
[0:17:17] <dekkitout> Doom wasn't always a G.A.A.S.
[0:17:18] <Ner234> @BusterRepukken pretty much yeah
[0:17:19] <%DatAsuna> Doom 2016 wasn't always advertising a 2020 game?
[0:17:19] <%mh9s> yeah not like that
[0:17:20] <MaxXtreme23> It definitely didnt have these before
[0:17:21] <jorniev> fuck this
[0:17:23] <%GeneralSCPatton> DOOT
[0:17:27] <%king_wragles> @WoolieVersus I ran through Doom to 100% a couple of times, I never saw a menu like that
[0:17:28] <MayorRev> doot
[0:17:29] <Aleate> "Yo where da video games?"
[0:17:31] <%RioGascar> i just had the title screen on launch

[0:17:43] <Ryan1016> It used to be just 3 modes taking up 1/3 screen each iirc
[0:17:47] <T_Sasquatch> i really really dont like this game, i played the free trial and it was awful , felt little impact
[0:17:49] <+frunkAF> woolie's playing a first person shooter?
[0:17:52] <BusterRepukken> good shit woolie
[0:17:52] <%jiggy_snipe> gj Woolz
[0:17:53] <+NecDW4> Woolie has been busy
[0:17:54] <ihateyouo> GRINDED OFF SCREEN
[0:17:54] <Tucker0603> @bimbobagging danke
[0:17:55] <+stooooo22> Woolie is a scraper
[0:17:55] <%FuqBoiSlim> "Yeah so I've been grinding off screen"
[0:17:56] <hericknhx> So I grinded a little bit off stream Kappa
[0:18:01] <+Corporate_Redeemer> So I ripped and tore some demons off-screen...
[0:18:02] <CoffeeSlice> Kappa
[0:18:05] <dapperskeleton69> offscreen grinding
[0:18:05] <OkamiDude15> so i grinded off screen a bit
[0:18:08] <MayorRev> ohh did he find the little marine toys?
[0:18:14] <GenoCL> yooo
[0:18:19] <%RioGascar> Grind their bones into dust?
[0:18:19] <MayorRev> aww i wanted to see his reaction
[0:18:25] <+tearknack> @WoolieVersus show him the fistpump
[0:18:27] <Saltmeisterr> wait there was a free trial?
[0:18:34] <dekkitout> "So I waded through the forces of Hell offscreen..."
[0:18:39] <%Grayhammatter> aw, didn't see the fistbump dude
[0:18:44] <%RioGascar> For doom the first level is shareware
[0:18:50] <BusterRepukken> @Saltmeisterr a demo of the multiplayer
[0:18:57] <@Solidus_113> Olivia is a fuck
[0:18:57] <Saltmeisterr> oh lol
[0:18:58] <BimboBagging> "so i beat the game off-screen"
[0:19:03] <MaxXtreme23> First episode is shareware, not first level
[0:19:05] <Tucker0603> read da lore
[0:19:05] <T_Sasquatch> @Saltmeisterr first level on ps4 is free
[0:19:07] <%Irridium> literally kill six billion demons
[0:19:11] <%mh9s> drill a hore
[0:19:14] <%RioGascar> Which bethesda loved to go “for those of you that didnt know shareware was a thing”
[0:19:21] <+Javaa01> Kill hell, again, again
[0:19:24] <dapperskeleton69> youll never get the satisfaction you want from killing olivia. YOU GET EVEN MORE
[0:19:25] <Drywall_Thief> Rip and tear, Woolie!
[0:19:27] <Asuxley> horde+hole=hore
[0:19:30] <%Solidnick18> lol
[0:19:31] <%Grayhammatter> HELL WAVE
[0:19:34] <%RioGascar> @maxxtreme23 No i mean this game. They made dooms first level free as shareware I believe
[0:19:40] <+jorgamund> surprise HELL WAVE
[0:19:41] <SilverInferno3> Kreygasm
[0:19:44] <dekkitout> S. Hayden's a cool dude
[0:19:46] <Huntercd> Who would think Demons are a good idea?
[0:19:46] <BusterRepukken> if you dont think this game has impact, then lmao
[0:19:47] <hericknhx> So we did a little fucky wucky Kappa
[0:19:53] <dapperskeleton69> WE'RE GONNA GO TO HELL SOON
[0:19:56] <%wolfofsound> doom guy get the all spark!
[0:19:59] <ihateyouo> MAX AMMO
[0:20:00] <ohnoitspooba> H E L L W A V E
[0:20:09] <MaxXtreme23> Oh, my b, thought you meant the original
[0:20:16] <Drywall_Thief> Doomslayer is like the IT guy coming in and stopping the executive from spilling burger grease all over everything and absolutely ruining the tech setup.
[0:20:17] <dmysta3000> Isnt this the same guy who voiced Reindhart from OW and Ardyn from FFXV?
[0:20:20] <Superdandy96> Who’d a thunk trying to watch a stream while puppysitting would be tough?
[0:20:21] <%gatorafan> HELLWAVES suck, don't open them in front of others like if you were using your cellphone.
[0:20:21] <@Solidus_113> woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM
[0:20:22] <%Grayhammatter> jesus
[0:20:26] <+Javaa01> Infinite micro missiles
[0:20:27] <SilverInferno3> Yeeeep
[0:20:28] <%Solidnick18> it's very good
[0:20:30] <dekkitout> It guns very goodly
[0:20:33] <+prime_name> More games need a Metroid Prime-esque map.
[0:20:34] <BusterRepukken> dont ride a hellwave
[0:20:35] <%mh9s> missiles for days baby
[0:20:38] <%Solidnick18> Gun gods
[0:20:39] <MaxXtreme23> Drains your ammo like crazy though
[0:20:39] <Ner234> G U N
[0:20:43] <%gatorafan> G U N
[0:20:46] <%RioGascar> And these are just this games upgrades
[0:20:49] <Saltmeisterr> it doess the shoot good
[0:20:49] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @ihateyouo
[0:20:49] <+jorgamund> damn, I need to go back and replay that, never unlocked the infinite missiles
[0:20:52] <moonlitdream> someone's been grinding
[0:20:52] <%RioGascar> Doom eternals upgrades sound insane
[0:20:59] <+Javaa01> For now
[0:21:03] <BusterRepukken> doom eternal sounds insane
[0:21:03] <%croxeye> wait till woolie gets the railgun :D
[0:21:15] <dapperskeleton69> i cant wait til woolie gets the super shotty
[0:21:16] <+Javaa01> Railgun is a while away though
[0:21:19] <hericknhx> This game is good, but some weapons are TOO strong *cough* supershotgun *cough*, good to see that they fixed that in Eternal
[0:21:22] <Drywall_Thief> Woolie what's your favorite gun for this game? Super Shotgun is my go-to.
[0:21:23] <+Javaa01> Definitely not in this session
[0:21:24] <SilverInferno3> It's actually really fun unlocking all the upgrades in this game
[0:21:36] <OkamiDude15> remote detonation is my perferred missile mod
[0:21:36] <+greenfall> woolie has already beat doom 2016?
[0:21:38] <@Squdnate> Wildest thing about Doom Eternal is that it's the first doom EVER to not have the pistol
[0:21:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> Stick 5 in 4 seconds?
[0:21:39] <Saltmeisterr> I like how the meathook is only mod for the supershotgun in eternal
[0:21:41] <+tearknack> he has not
[0:21:46] <dapperskeleton69> super shotty is the best gun in the game AS IT SHOULD BE
[0:21:47] <+Javaa01> @greenfall His first time
[0:21:49] <whazat> pistol bad
[0:21:51] <+tearknack> supershotgun existing is (mild) spoilers
[0:21:51] <SilverInferno3> @greenfall THis is blind
[0:21:53] <%RioGascar> i wish snap map community didnt suck and make only meme maps
[0:21:54] <Drywall_Thief> @dapperskeleton69 Amen
[0:22:00] <sleepy_pink> pistol bad
[0:22:02] <SeruraRenge> Pro Doom when Woolie
[0:22:02] <+SkaiVibration> useful
[0:22:03] <+kewlmyc> What? Pistol is good for head shots
[0:22:04] <%Solidnick18> good
[0:22:08] <+ThatHomestar> pistol in doom 2016 was the worst it's ever been
[0:22:09] <+Javaa01> Pistol is endless trash
[0:22:12] <Drywall_Thief> Pistol only runs are for true doom slayers
[0:22:14] <OkamiDude15> pistol is alright
[0:22:14] <%croxeye> they just need to release a level editor cuz snap maps is too limiting
[0:22:15] <+Javaa01> Because it has infinite ammo
[0:22:18] <+ThatHomestar> at least in classic doom and doom 3 is had SOME use
[0:22:20] <dapperskeleton69> @squdnate it does have the pistol, its just incredibly bad
[0:22:24] <%Solidnick18> more secrets to find easily
[0:22:26] <hericknhx> Pistol was good in the old games, this is one it's not so great
[0:22:30] <+PleasantLeech> pistol isn't useless it just doesn't compare to how beastly every other gun is
[0:22:32] <MaxXtreme23> Lore aplenty in this ga,e
[0:22:34] <RadicalWeegee> DEEP LORE
[0:22:35] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:22:41] <@Squdnate> @dapperskeleton69 Nope, the weapon wheel was shown off recently, and the pistol is now gone
[0:22:42] <+Javaa01> Yeah, there's some fun stuff in that codex
[0:22:43] <%Solidnick18> It's awesome lore
[0:22:44] <Huntercd> !uptime
[0:22:45] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 22 minutes and 47 seconds
[0:22:45] <Drywall_Thief> Pistol in this game is crummier than previous games, but it has the tradeoff of infinite ammo
[0:22:46] <ihateyouo> lore is good in this game
[0:22:46] <sleepy_pink> moderately good lore
[0:22:46] <dapperskeleton69> pistol is for "oh shit im out of ammo"
[0:22:47] <Saltmeisterr> it is gud shit
[0:22:54] <@Solidus_113> you should never be out of ammo
[0:22:57] <dapperskeleton69> wait really eternal has no pistol?
[0:22:57] <SeruraRenge> @ThatHomestar Nah it was still worse in Doom 1/2 because you got the shotgun 2 seconds in and the chaingun uses the same ammo as the pistol, and in 2 you use the SS for everything
[0:22:58] <dekkitout> But can the lore be read to you by a well spoken Englishman?
[0:23:02] <%RioGascar> @croxeye Snap map actually is not limiting. I programmed whole modes together using programming nodes and created campaigns...shame no one played em
[0:23:11] <hericknhx> Also, those mesages are funny as fuck as you go through the game LUL
[0:23:18] <%Binary_Fireball> Binary_Fireball converted from a Twitch Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub! 
[0:23:23] <MayorRev> its cool tho shut up
[0:23:28] <%blacksoap65> @woolievesus Sake pase Woolie and Reggie
[0:23:33] <Saltmeisterr> theres pistol in eternal but the chainsaw regen's ammo
[0:23:34] <SilverInferno3> @hericknhx "chanting"
[0:23:35] <ihateyouo> rune
[0:23:35] <+ThatHomestar> in doom 2016 punching enemies does more damage than the pistol lol
[0:23:38] <MaxXtreme23> Also, I'd argue the pistol in this game is better than it was in the last 4, because it has infinite ammo and glory kills are a thing
[0:23:38] <dapperskeleton69> @woolieversus the map will help a ton with finding secrets
[0:23:48] <Saltmeisterr> but it only recharges one pip
[0:23:51] <Drywall_Thief> The entire lore of this game is: Doomslayer was too mean, we had to lock him in a box so we could actually get something done.
[0:23:55] <%Solidnick18> awesome
[0:23:55] <Drywall_Thief> And I LOVE it
[0:23:56] <sleepy_pink> I wonder if the pistol is even gonna be in eternal
[0:23:59] <bearalin> What mission are they on?
[0:24:05] <sleepy_pink> this is argent facility
[0:24:05] <@Solidus_113> Automap will show you pretty much everything
[0:24:07] <dapperskeleton69> looka like mission 4
[0:24:08] <%croxeye> yknow what, you're right @RioGascar i haven't touched snapmaps in forever so forgot that, my bad
[0:24:09] <sleepy_pink> mission 4
[0:24:09] <Calek> mission 4 I think?
[0:24:12] <%Irridium> clean
[0:24:12] <T_Sasquatch> i always thought doom felt chunky not arcadey
[0:24:13] <Saltmeisterr> argent facillity
[0:24:14] <Drywall_Thief> Mission 4
[0:24:15] <SeruraRenge> @Drywall_Thief Or if you believe some people, he stayed in hell after the events of Doom 64
[0:24:16] <%Solidnick18> ehh
[0:24:17] <hericknhx> @SilverInferno3 I love the one in the VEGA level where they straight up said you suck and should work more LUL
[0:24:38] <hericknhx> always follow the green light FeelsGoodMan
[0:24:44] <%RioGascar> Woolie seems much more use to the game now
[0:24:55] <@Solidus_113> I SEE THAT
[0:24:56] <dapperskeleton69> if anyone knows welcome to nightvale, the comoany messages are very strexcorpesque
[0:24:57] <@Solidus_113> RUNE TRIAL
[0:25:00] <@Solidus_113> on the map
[0:25:01] <Drywall_Thief> @SeruraRenge That is what happened since it is canon this is the OG doomguy but he has been kicking it in Hell
[0:25:01] <Saltmeisterr> he has been grinding
[0:25:03] <Victory_Boss> Anyone hear popping when Reggie talks?
[0:25:04] <+CrystalLakeWasJusASetback> Can you rocket jump up there?
[0:25:04] <buffmurffy> has woolie acknowledged that the mini doomguys are funko pops?
[0:25:10] <%Irridium> you could've jumped to the second level on that middle platform
[0:25:17] <BusterRepukken> theyre not funko pops, I own one
[0:25:18] <Saltmeisterr> sshh don't tell him
[0:25:20] <SeruraRenge> Mick Gordon's music in this game is fine but I miss Bobby Prince just barely avoiding getting sued for ripping famous metal albums for the game music
[0:25:23] <%Grayhammatter> keep following
[0:25:24] <Drywall_Thief> WoolieWoolz and the Funko Bunch
[0:25:28] <+Javaa01> There is one figure you WILL NOT get without assistance later in the game, because you never played the original DOOM 2
[0:25:37] <@Solidus_113> follow green lights
[0:25:37] <%Irridium> green lights. follow green
[0:25:47] <%The_Timo> The green lights line up jumps
[0:25:49] <Saltmeisterr> green gud
[0:25:51] <sleepy_pixels> green lights are always good, follow them :)
[0:25:57] <hericknhx> @WoolieVersus Green lights are the way my friend
[0:26:00] <%Grayhammatter> green is good
[0:26:03] <dapperskeleton69> dont worry wools, you get a double jump next level
[0:26:07] <ihateyouo> GREEn Good
[0:26:11] <%RioGascar> Micks music in this is great if because its very unique. He showed the process for making the remade for at dooms gate
[0:26:12] <whazat> remember, BFG stands for Be Following Green

[0:27:34] <+duneblythe> you're unaware of the danger you are provoking
[0:27:36] <SeruraRenge> @RioGascar My issue is it reminds me too much of Quake. Honestly this game in general is a little too much like quake compared to Doom 1/2
[0:27:36] <dapperskeleton69> KIRBY AINT HERE TO HELP YOU NOW
[0:27:51] <+Javaa01> Yeah, the secret missions don't give you weapon attachments to work with unless the mission SPECIFICALLY requires one

[0:28:38] <arkv01> a vacuum you say :P
[0:28:45] <ihateyouo> load times are not great
[0:28:47] <@Solidus_113> @croxeye it's 100/75 armour
[0:28:47] <MayorRev> vacuum gives the biggest succ
[0:28:48] <jorniev> YOU BETTER GET ALL OF THESE
[0:28:49] <Elcaeses> vacum is in the top 3 of perks
[0:28:54] <%DatAsuna> RUNE TIME
[0:28:56] <%RioGascar> Console load times are bad yeah
[0:28:56] <%DatAsuna> FINALLY
[0:29:04] <SeruraRenge> Also, playing this game with a controller and not using centered gun view just feels....wrong.
[0:29:11] <%croxeye> yeah with armor
[0:29:16] <%RioGascar> I dont like the centered gun
[0:29:16] <dapperskeleton69> nah i didnt use centered gun
[0:29:18] <%DatAsuna> Look at the other ones
[0:29:22] <acedeone> hi all
[0:29:24] <dapperskeleton69> centered gun feels weird
[0:29:26] <%SuttonsGaming> SuttonsGaming subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! woolieMIRIN
[0:29:27] <NicholasKane> not a fan of centered gun myself either
[0:29:29] <SilverInferno3> FPS Elitists bleh
[0:29:29] <@Solidus_113> some are more hidden than others
[0:29:30] <SeruraRenge> centered gun is what the first 2 games and quake did though
[0:29:30] <%fattness132> Some are hidden, most you get along the way
[0:29:31] <NickHatesSnow> Not too hard to find
[0:29:32] <%mh9s> they are super not sekrit
[0:29:43] <dapperskeleton69> yeah centered worked good in the og games
[0:29:43] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:29:44] <+PleasantLeech> I love the centered gun
[0:29:45] <+Javaa01> Yeah, once you complete the challenge, you get more SUCC
[0:29:50] <Vyneci> There's some REALLY broken rune combos
[0:29:51] <%RioGascar> Sure but it just doesn’t look good
[0:29:52] <ihateyouo> Eternal has even more
[0:29:57] <WanderingSwordsman> what lvl is he on?
[0:29:57] <Drywall_Thief> They aren't secret but the later ones get more challenging but the rewards are STELLAR
[0:29:58] <ihateyouo> a lot more
[0:29:58] <%fattness132> The distance for glory kills rune is Kreygasm
[0:30:04] <dapperskeleton69> doing centered guns in 3d isnt great
[0:30:10] <hericknhx> Eternal is going to be great man Kreygasm
[0:30:16] <+Javaa01> LEVER HERE
[0:30:17] <%RioGascar> now eternal is getting centered again, but its not just a game update and is built in
[0:30:19] <SilverInferno3> I too love shooting straight out of my crotch
[0:30:24] <%RioGascar> so maybe the design will be better
[0:30:26] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @dapperskeleton69
[0:30:27] <Drywall_Thief> Centered Guns is a no from me, Chief. I hated The Original in TF2
[0:30:28] <%GeneralSCPatton> Gun upgrade time?
[0:30:32] <dapperskeleton69> ok bot
[0:30:32] <+PleasantLeech> just wait until you get the rune that makes you zoom toward enemies that can be glory killed.
[0:30:33] <%Irridium> I loved the centered weapon shit's hilarious
[0:30:34] <MaxXtreme23> man, ya'll play doom 2 mods? there's some hilariously great doom 4 mods for doom 2 lol
[0:30:38] <rideroftraps1> Lever her
[0:30:38] <SeruraRenge> also just a random thing but I REALLY hate iron sights in fps games. How hard is it to just give me a crosshair and have the bullets go where the crosshair is?
[0:30:40] <awalr> probably looks better if they keep that angle in mind when modeling
[0:30:45] <acedeone> secrets like in other Dooms , are proportionaly awesome
[0:30:45] <%DatAsuna> Air control is <3

[0:31:59] <$rytyoung> RIP AND TEAR
[0:32:05] <MaxXtreme23> yeah they are all technically mods, but a lot of the modern gameplay affecting ones are technically in the .pk3 format, so it's just easier to call them mods at this point
[0:32:12] <%SuttonsGaming> GenoCL and it feels like it came out yesterday
[0:32:21] <DeathByPoke7> woolie got good
[0:32:29] <GenoCL> @SuttonsGaming yeah, it's amazing, it still feels super recent

[0:33:02] <LtKregorov> you ain't seen nothing yet
[0:33:03] <cheesedburgers> I can’t believe this game took 4 years to get a sequel
[0:33:03] <Drywall_Thief> Woolie you fool you MAG-DUMPED!

[0:33:12] <%Solidnick18> he said leave me alone
[0:33:13] <acedeone> @woolieversus how hype are you for Eternal now that you are playing this
[0:33:17] <masterfire23> aiming with a controller is always hard imo
[0:33:19] <Ryan1016> WE COMIN FOR YOU UPGRADE
[0:33:21] <NickHatesSnow> Man I remember that fucking drone
[0:33:22] <+Javaa01> It knows that if he sticks around, he's gonna start flashing orange
[0:33:25] <jorniev> cant wait for the siege mode in THAT gun
[0:33:26] <%Grayhammatter> you can't ESCAPE
[0:33:28] <dapperskeleton69> @drywall_thief DOOMEY DOOMEY DOOMEY
[0:33:28] <%Solidnick18> oooo
[0:33:29] <j12k100> @woolieversus Samuel hayden is basically the second antagonist in doom 2016. if Samuel hayden is dead in doom eternal then i hope that doom guy drags his dead robot body and then throw into the boiling magma
[0:33:31] <ihateyouo> get the secret weapon
[0:33:38] <ihateyouo> you got to
[0:33:38] <CoffeeSlice> LUL
[0:33:42] <SeruraRenge> I will say this about Doom 16, it reminded the key thing about fps design that Romero set forth: that it's much more satisfying to move fast and be fragile than to move slow and be able to take lots of hits
[0:33:45] <ihateyouo> it's amazing
[0:33:47] <%king_wragles> I remember always having the armor rune, but still using the normal fire for the assault rifle just so I can hit small / fast targets
[0:33:48] <Haaztre> It knows you're going to steal its lunch money.
[0:33:49] <Drywall_Thief> If Woolie misses the Super Gun I will weep blood.
[0:33:52] <dapperskeleton69> there is no secret gun???
[0:33:54] <+tearknack> hell on mars
[0:34:12] <SilverInferno3> @j12k100 Sounds like someone doesn't want to save humanity!
[0:34:19] <%Solidnick18> thanks vacuum
[0:34:22] <MaxXtreme23> Would Woolie agree with Hayden opening a portal to hell to get juicy hell energy
[0:34:23] <%RioGascar> @serurarenge Yes but thats hard as fuck to design for. half life was a hybrid and that is probably the hardest to design the idea around
[0:34:26] <%Solidnick18> Nasty
[0:34:28] <%mh9s> yeyeyeye

[0:34:48] <jorniev> ITS A ME DOMGUY
[0:34:56] <dapperskeleton69> @maxxtreme23 if woolie knew he would get jump boots from hell energy hed be all over samuel
[0:34:56] <arkv01> reggie baby nuttt Kreygasm
[0:34:57] <%RioGascar> also probably easier to market to as this can be seen as too hard for normal players
[0:35:00] <+tearknack> @The_Timo i'll ship it
[0:35:03] <acedeone> Variety is the spice of life
[0:35:05] <SeruraRenge> It's not hard, just make the player a glass cannon. Go play Blood or the original '97 Shadow Warrior, they both did it perfectly
[0:35:07] <juxtest> wooliePOYO Come at me demons
[0:35:09] <cheesedburgers> That machine gun really feels like Titanfall except human sized

[0:39:36] <SeruraRenge> Here's the real question chat: This game revived Doom after Doom 3 was seen as mediocre and we had that terrible movie. Is it possible to revive the Duke after DNF and go back to the glory of Duke 3D?
[0:39:44] <%RioGascar> No
[0:39:45] <Halospaz117> WOW

[0:41:26] <+Javaa01> Yeah, the knight curbstomps the FUCK out of you
[0:41:33] <%allups> that imp got promoted
[0:41:34] <MaxXtreme23> @SeruraRenge I think in today's politically correct environment, it'll be really difficult to bring back Duke, given what the character's all about. There's also the fact that the ones with the license right now are Gearbox so I wouldn't get your hopes up sadly.
[0:41:35] <+patriotrenegade> W A O W
[0:41:43] <buffmurffy> they're throwing parades for that imp
[0:41:50] <acedeone> YouTube compilation prob out there
[0:41:51] <SeruraRenge> @President_valentine I disagree. Sure Duke 1 and 2 are products of their time because they were sidescrolling platformers, but Duke 3D is still a timeless classic, you can go back to it any time and it plays great. The problem with DNF was it being a jumbled mess of ideas from 14 years of the shooter genre
[0:41:53] <+patriotrenegade> I’m sure there’s a YouTube comp
[0:41:53] <Drywall_Thief> I am totally drawing Woolie crushing the Argent shard and becoming evil and crying out "SATAN!"

[0:42:14] <@Solidus_113> AKA Doom Eternal
[0:42:20] <OkamiDude15> i find the best way to beat the shield demons is to use the remote detonation
[0:42:31] <Drywall_Thief> @dapperskeleton69 DM me a link to the subreddit, I actually still need to join
[0:42:35] <dapperskeleton69> grenades work wonders in this game
[0:42:37] <SeruraRenge> @MaxXtreme23 You say that but Shadow Warrior was brought back by using a younger Lo Wang. It can be done.
[0:42:39] <Calek> I think the scoped heavy assault rifle ended up being my favourite weapon in the game

[0:46:33] <Halospaz117> Despite all my Rage I failed to pick up the Haste
[0:46:34] <a1337spy> haste also doubles your shooting speed
[0:46:35] <+Javaa01> Haste makes EVERYTHING faster
[0:46:35] <%Solidnick18> speedoo
[0:46:36] <Elcaeses> it's not rage
[0:46:37] <%allups> like the old games
[0:46:40] <ihateyouo> GET THE CEXRET
[0:46:48] <%RioGascar> Quad damage is...dangerous
[0:46:49] <Vyneci> Uh oh, graphical glitch LUL
[0:46:51] <alexandrecau> nice seeing them so new at the game that different buff is shocking
[0:46:54] <ihateyouo> GET TJE GUN
[0:46:58] <Saltmeisterr> haste got a buff in eternal, it now also gives infinite ammo
[0:46:59] <%Irridium> haste boosts speed AND fire-rate. a hasted plasma rifle is a beast
[0:47:08] <hassanico2> Yo Woolie likes the grenades, good taste!
[0:47:15] <SeruraRenge> I dont know if he'll get to it tonight, but I hope to get in Civvie's line about the SS when he grabs it
[0:47:16] <%sporeian94> Doomguy literally stop hell invading 3 times, then after the third he went to hell and stayed in hell to punish them
[0:47:16] <hassanico2> People dislike the grenades in this game I feel
[0:47:23] <MaxXtreme23> Doom 2 ends with the invasion stopped on the Earth front but Final Doom has the Demons continue their invasion from space, and Doom 64 has him continuing the onslaught and realizing by the end that the demons will never stop, so he stays behind in hell to make sure they can never get out, which makes the ending tie very cleanly into 2016
[0:47:23] <dapperskeleton69> those grenades will save your LIFE
[0:47:24] <%DatAsuna> I only ever used the decoy grenades, I'll admit
[0:47:27] <$Punisher7771> so so far woolie is a glass cannon
[0:47:28] <%ShogunNoonto> woolie playing rip and tear?
[0:47:30] <3Xgilly> Just remember to USE the grenades
[0:47:32] <OkamiDude15> the grenades a super good
[0:47:33] <Knoxx_Gold> I just completely forgot the grenades existed in my game
[0:47:34] <@Solidus_113> Get that shotgun one
[0:47:36] <+Javaa01> Seven points to wait on a new gun
[0:47:43] <NicholasKane> hey, be aware that if you're ever running low on fuel, you can throw grenades behind the shield guys
[0:47:43] <+Javaa01> Cause SSG is around
[0:47:51] <%FuqBoiSlim> I didnt dislike I straight up forgot they existed after the 2nd map
[0:47:51] <dapperskeleton69> the health steal nades yoy get later are god tier
[0:47:53] <$GoogleyGareth> Wonder why he's still glowing yellow.
[0:47:54] <+Javaa01> And SSG is what you want, it's what you NEED
[0:47:59] <SeruraRenge> @MaxXtreme23 And then Doom 3 was some guy on Mars when all the bad shit first went down and it's kinda implied that maybe sorta he lived
[0:48:00] <$GoogleyGareth> LUL oh yes
[0:48:01] <NickHatesSnow> yyeyeyeyyeeyeyeey
[0:48:03] <%fattness132> Super shotgun Kreygasm

[0:48:09] <OkamiDude15> super shotty nkoGasm
[0:48:10] <%RioGascar> graphical glitch
[0:48:10] <DeathByPoke7> grenades dont feel like a very doom weapon . unless they come out of a luncher
[0:48:10] <hassanico2> A shotgun... but super
[0:48:10] <CoffeeSlice> YEYEYEYEYE
[0:48:12] <dapperskeleton69> DOUBLE BARREL MADNESS
[0:48:12] <%Solidnick18> it's a good gun
[0:48:13] <morganagod> Supershotgun floe3 floe4
[0:48:15] <cheesedburgers> SUPERSHOTTY
[0:48:16] <@Solidus_113> SSG doesn't have weapon buffs though
[0:48:16] <+Javaa01> It's HERE, just find it
[0:48:20] <hassanico2> Super SHotgun God Super Shotgun
[0:48:20] <dekkitout> Take a shotgun, give it a red cape and flexible morals; bam! Super Shorgun
[0:48:23] <%allups> its not tht great in this game
[0:48:24] <%sporeian94> THE MCDOUBLE
[0:48:27] <+buttdirt> super shotgun is mobile lawnmower
[0:48:28] <%mh9s> supah shotty bb
[0:48:29] <%allups> dont at me
[0:48:29] <SilverInferno3> Super Shotgun is a Big Bang Attack in two barrels
[0:48:31] <OkamiDude15> it does have weapon upgrades
[0:48:31] <+king_trito> @DatAsuna no fuck doom 3 fuck u DansGame
[0:48:34] <disister1201> the ssg is my waifu
[0:48:34] <Saltmeisterr> twice the barrels double the fun
[0:48:35] <$Punisher7771> the reason the doomslayers mad is cause a his son is now the icon of sin
[0:48:36] <dapperskeleton69> THIS IS MY BOOMSTICK
[0:48:36] <MaxXtreme23> @SeruraRenge There's a book on Doomguy's bookshelf in Eternal that implies the poor dude from 3 was retconned lol
[0:48:37] <%fattness132> This music is the fucking best
[0:48:39] <Vyneci> There's still a little bit until the Super Shotgun, you can spend some of those points if you want
[0:48:40] <jorniev> is that the shotgun with an absurd spread and range?
[0:48:40] <+kira2993> SourPls
[0:48:41] <SeruraRenge> "But Civvie, why don't you just call it the Super Shotgun? Because it's better. Because it's SUPER"
[0:48:43] <NickHatesSnow> SSG is the game changer
[0:48:46] <%RioGascar> I wonder if woolie doesnt know about BFG
[0:48:47] <NicholasKane> doom 3's death cube thing was cool at least
[0:48:49] <%sporeian94> Hey remember that Polygon video of them playing Doom as bad as human possibly could
[0:48:59] <SeruraRenge> If Batman were a gun, he'd be the Super Shotgun
[0:48:59] <hassanico2> Hell Knight getting oooowned
[0:49:01] <Hal10k> It isn't an exaggeration to say that Doom 2's Super Shotgun is one of the most important weapons in all of videogames
[0:49:02] <cheesedburgers> Super shotgun is in this level but can’t you get it later if you miss it
[0:49:03] <%DatAsuna> @king_trito the movie is better than Doom 3 :P
[0:49:09] <+ianabstract> GOOMBA
[0:49:10] <3Xgilly> Is Doom Eternal releasing on the Switch in march?
[0:49:12] <+king_trito> @sporeian94 I get vietnam flashbacks from that video

[0:53:54] <SeruraRenge> Controllers let you aim just as well as a mouse, they said

[0:54:55] <MaxXtreme23> Wonder why woolie doesn't use his cursed setup for this game
[0:55:03] <fist_wizard_jay> YEAH
[0:55:07] <ll_aja_ll> hey chat, where's he at rn?
[0:55:07] <+VariantX7> put the pistol back into the coffin that they pulled the slayer out of

[0:55:14] <MayorRev> keep callin it shit when u run out of bullets
[0:55:19] <dapperskeleton69> @ll_aja_ll level4
[0:55:19] <Saltmeisterr> gyro aim is tight if its properly implemented
[0:55:19] <%king_wragles> The pistol felt more like a tool than an actual weapon
[0:55:20] <SilverInferno3> @MaxXtreme23 He's on the PS4
[0:55:21] <RadicalWeegee> The pistol in a holster is just for style
[0:55:22] <%RioGascar> Throw the pistol at the demons
[0:55:24] <%Grayhammatter> hurt me plenty
[0:55:28] <+quinnage7> Woolie should look up top level play
[0:55:30] <OldOnyx> charge shot on the pistol is marginally useful
[0:55:36] <dapperskeleton69> the shotgun has always been the real pistol
[0:55:36] <ll_aja_ll> pistol is godlike stfu
[0:55:37] <%DatAsuna> The pistol just exists for when you have no ammo or gas
[0:55:37] <Calek> I thought the shotgun sucked the more weapons I got
[0:55:38] <acedeone> I'm too young to die!
[0:55:43] <%DatAsuna> but it's not bad
[0:55:44] <+kewlmyc> You have to equip that new rune manually
[0:55:44] <DeathByPoke7> now imagine a Super shotgun
[0:55:46] <NickHatesSnow> Shotgun is based but you don't know nothing yet
[0:55:50] <MayorRev> Pistol is S tier
[0:55:51] <FirewallStorm> you're going to love the super shotty
[0:55:52] <%Irridium> fun fact in DOOM Eternal they just took out the pistol. first weapon is a shotgun because of course it should be
[0:55:53] <cheesedburgers> “Use your fists to heal” is such a beautiful description of this game and the glory kill system
[0:55:54] <hassanico2> Has he found any action figures?
[0:55:56] <+CatastropheCorvid> No-one tell him about the plasma cannon.
[0:55:58] <+NecDW4> Fuckin Reggie with the Kilroy reference
[0:55:58] <SeruraRenge> The pistol has never been important in any Doom game. Name a single Doom game where they didn't give you the shotgun to replace it in the first minute
[0:56:02] <sleepy_pixels> i am the modern man

[1:07:42] <%Solidnick18> haha
[1:07:42] <graemecrackers1> The sickness
[1:07:43] <CoffeeSlice> LUL
[1:07:43] <icyjiub> I never have that problem with original doom but I was feeling it with this
[1:07:44] <+prime_name> But the Lore!
[1:07:44] <CursedNobleman> no, thats valid
[1:07:45] <MaxXtreme23> I guess I've played enough Doom 1 and 2 that doesn't fuck with me much lol
[1:07:46] <alexandrecau> so yesterday
[1:07:46] <+PleasantLeech> woolie there's a secret in the green water
[1:07:47] <Rngiddion> doesnt really get to me
[1:07:50] <%Lightning_Bolt_Action> WEAK EYES. THEY HAVE WEAK EYES AND WEAKER STOMACHS.
[1:07:52] <+duneblythe> I am fine with it, you're just a bitch
[1:07:55] <+CptnCampy61> Why is he takin us down with him
[1:07:55] <ihateyouo> go back
[1:07:55] <jorniev> haha oh im das again
[1:07:57] <outlawmap> That's literally motion sickness
[1:08:03] <+BlockingDisabled> It doesn't phase me when I'm in control.
[1:08:05] <icyjiub> I literally play fuckloads of doom 1 & 2 mods, but that fucked with me
[1:08:06] <+notoculat> did he not finish the room?
[1:08:08] <xeros720> was there anything else in there?
[1:08:10] <+silvery_cricket> that is motion sickness Woolie
[1:08:10] <DeebzNutz100> does nothing for me
[1:08:14] <+NotHereToStream> I thought woolie had the sharingen Kappa
[1:08:20] <+kira2993> get better EYES LUL (that's motion sickness)
[1:08:20] <%allups> it didn't make u sound like an idiot
[1:08:24] <masterfire23> i feel lime that when i play a shooter in 60fps
[1:08:24] <+McSoliace> i didn't believe woolie until just now
[1:08:26] <SilverInferno3> Nah there's nothing else IIRC
[1:08:27] <LtKregorov> UNREAL Tournament, sooo good
[1:08:31] <hassanico2> Dudes play Half Life 1 multiplayer, that game is inhumanly fast
[1:08:35] <%RioGascar> later VR games do it, but budget cuts just lets you clip through the wall and sorta goes transparent and wants you to go back
[1:08:39] <NWannabe> UT was my first FPS, i totally get reggie tho.
[1:08:39] <CursedNobleman> i have that issue in vamp masquerade and the old goldeneye
[1:08:43] <Rangenade> woolie y ur eye suck so bad atpRtsd
[1:08:44] <Saltmeisterr> arena fps FeelsBadMan
[1:08:45] <dekkitout> @NotHereToStream He does, he just used Susan too much tajC
[1:08:45] <Finakala> Original UT is the best multiplayer FPS of all time don't @ me
[1:08:47] <NicholasKane> it's not exactly "not motion sickness, it's everyone" so much as it's "motion sickness is super common"
[1:08:52] <NWannabe> im no longer good at fps but i never got that sickness
[1:09:01] <cheesedburgers> Walls look like walls instead of Vague Epilepsy Causers
[1:09:02] <icyjiub> i wonder if increasing the FOV would help
[1:09:04] <%mh9s> yeah that shit makes me VERY sick as well
[1:09:08] <SeruraRenge> You could just not have run always on in doom 1/2, I mean when is it necessary outside of rocket dueling with the Cyberdemon?
[1:09:09] <%vextalyst> vextalyst subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! Watching you play this game really makes me Miss Totalbiscuit. I still remember his legendary stream where he went in super negative and got blown away by its awesomness. I swear his turnaround felt like a character arc
[1:09:11] <satans_finest_millennial> balls to the walllz
[1:09:12] <hassanico2> Both Wolfenstein and Doom are fully made in a 2D engine and it's nuts
[1:09:12] <%fattness132> Its like texture epilepsy
[1:09:20] <+notoculat> the fov probably would help actually
[1:09:23] <+Javaa01> Environmental Resistance is good to go for, it reduces damage from random barrels
[1:09:24] <%Irridium> man I played the shit out of UT and Quake 3. A shame those franchises never came back in the modern age. Never. At all. Shut up Quake Champions doesn't count.
[1:09:27] <@Solidus_113> there was a path down on the right, across the gorge
[1:09:28] <PauliusMaximus> wouldnt the opposite just be an uncomfort cage?
[1:09:28] <ihateyouo> DRON
[1:09:31] <CoffeeSlice> DRONE
[1:09:32] <ihateyouo> DRONE
[1:09:38] <SirRoyco> Why would you even be that close to the wall, unless your secret hunting?
[1:09:44] <fairore> @nwannabe you were never good at fps's
[1:09:50] <%croxeye> he can get the drone offscreen too
[1:09:56] <icyjiub> Imagine if he was playing the original with a source port with Vertical look, but using the software renderer
[1:09:57] <%RioGascar> because 90’s fps wanted you to hug walls
[1:10:01] <icyjiub> puke central
[1:10:07] <%RioGascar> and press E on every single wall
[1:10:13] <xeros720> there's a late game upgrade that puts the secrets on the map too
[1:10:14] <icyjiub> ...Not really
[1:10:17] <%RioGascar> to find that stupid secret
[1:10:23] <SirRoyco> That's secret hunting though, not the main gameplay loop
[1:10:25] <@Solidus_113> @xeros720 he got that
[1:10:28] <icyjiub> most secrets are telegraphed with misaligned textures
[1:10:28] <%Irridium> that's how you found secrets you slid on the wall, humping it until one spot opened
[1:10:31] <+Javaa01> Hump those walls
[1:10:32] <%wolfofsound> hell yeah CS
[1:10:33] <Rangenade> my kryptonite is that ship swinging ride at carnivals , makes me wanna barf
[1:10:38] <VJdarkworld> doooor stuuuck
[1:10:42] <xeros720> oh yeah? that's good
[1:10:46] <icyjiub> you only hump walls if you suck at finding secrets
[1:10:46] <@Solidus_113> RIGHT
[1:10:47] <%RioGascar> In good fps games sure, but normal fps games nah
[1:10:48] <+Javaa01> And people haven't gotten any worse in the past 20 years
[1:10:48] <SirRoyco> I played tons of Duke 3D, I know about wall humping
[1:10:49] <+MisterVantes> Reggie my boi PogChamp
[1:10:58] <NWannabe> Fuck CS. Got sniped in an airplane and had to wait 10 minutes for the next match

[1:34:44] <awalr> ignore chat, but especially ignore it when chat tells you to ignore chat
[1:34:45] <NicholasKane> alright, thats fine, but i think the chat really does want you to spend 20 minutes of dead time trying to get a secret

[1:35:01] <+king_trito> "what the fuck!?" - Woolie, 2020
[1:35:02] <+Javaa01> Just keep pushing in the direction they're in
[1:35:03] <+YabbaTroll> KILL FAST
[1:35:05] <%Irridium> this one is kind of hard
[1:35:05] <dekkitout> Sniff out the cowardly demons
[1:35:06] <retardeddoggo> when did you realise his disability wasnt a bit. how does he find his own toilet.
[1:35:10] <rob_pat> woolie.... more like bully
[1:35:10] <%Solidnick18> this one is hard
[1:35:13] <NickHatesSnow> just keep following the trail
[1:35:13] <StarlitStunner> stripYan
[1:35:18] <@Solidus_113> that's because you went backwards instead of forward
[1:35:47] <Jalamity> I spent like 20 minutes on it last week -- just keep moving along the perimeter
[1:35:49] <SpaceGuntank> LUL LUL LUL
[1:35:55] <Tucker0603> murder forward
[1:35:55] <RadicalWeegee> this one was brutal for me
[1:36:00] <OkamiDude15> you can double tap melee since they're the weakest demon if you wan glory kills
[1:36:01] <%king_wragles> On the bright side, you get to play around with the super shotty for a good while
[1:36:02] <cheesedburgers> This one is Rough
[1:36:06] <+greenfall> melee is your friend
[1:36:07] <redrins> hall wugging

[1:36:44] <%mh9s> big circle woolz
[1:36:45] <%Grayhammatter> nice try
[1:36:48] <DeathByPoke7> this talkes a bit
[1:36:48] <+Javaa01> You just need to do a circle
[1:36:49] <%Irridium> big circle
[1:37:00] <+tearknack> @WoolieVersus it takes like, two hit to melee kill these chumps
[1:37:01] <NicholasKane> Reggie: it is the case that one melee attack puts that enemy in the stagger state, yes.
[1:37:03] <RaklarLS> this challenge is particularly frustrating, especially on a controller. but i guess you did it, chat.
[1:37:05] <alexandrecau> you can melee kill in one hit
[1:37:24] <DeathByPoke7> theres the flow
[1:37:30] <worldbrand> oh nooo
[1:37:31] <%wolfofsound> paniced
[1:37:35] <Josef_Stryker> Noooo
[1:37:46] <+AugustHaze> Press melee twice
[1:38:00] <buffmurffy> does woolie know you can cancel melee into glorykill?
[1:38:35] <worldbrand> nooooo!
[1:38:43] <Maids4lyfe> you went backwards again
[1:38:47] <+notoculat> close!
[1:38:48] <+tearknack> i don't think he's figured it out

[1:41:01] <@Solidus_113> with double jump boots that one will be easier to get

[1:41:08] <cheesedburgers> Gun! Go! Up!
[1:41:09] <SilverInferno3> DfA is also a lot easier with the double jump
[1:41:10] <MayorRev> does that affect chainsaw kills?
[1:41:14] <+tearknack> it's better to actually kill them with the shotgun then miss them, the time the glory kill animation takes makes the extra time not worth it

[1:47:09] <%GeneralSCPatton> HEAT BLAST
[1:47:11] <+ProtoShawk> Stun bomb is incredible
[1:47:12] <+Javaa01> Super Shotgun doesn't NEED one
[1:47:13] <Timesteel> Stun Bomb is too good
[1:47:15] <dapperskeleton69> super shotty has no mods
[1:47:15] <Halospaz117> No Super Shotty upgrades
[1:47:17] <Tucker0603> HEAT BLAST
[1:47:18] <+waltzqueen> Play Slayer!
[1:47:18] <Vyneci> Super Shotgun doesn't have mods
[1:47:18] <+Javaa01> SSG is OP as is
[1:47:18] <NicholasKane> the super shotgun is already super
[1:47:19] <%wujak> heat blast is good. super shotgun doesnt have mods
[1:47:19] <whazat> stun bomb is gg
[1:47:20] <+Frunkle24> logged on just in time for bfg division fuck yeah
[1:47:20] <DeathByPoke7> the super shotgun is too super for upgrades
[1:47:24] <SilverInferno3> SSG is already peak
[1:47:27] <@Solidus_113> Super shotgun DOESN'T NEED ONE
[1:47:28] <%Solidnick18> stun bomb
[1:47:29] <%Irridium> super shotgun gets nothing because it's more than good enough
[1:47:29] <%fattness132> Super shotgun has none
[1:47:29] <CuttleCrow> its already that good
[1:47:32] <+YabbaTroll> You think super shotgun needs an upgrade?
[1:47:32] <CoffeeSlice> SSG is peak performance
[1:47:34] <%Kazuhira_Boat> Sup shotgun too stronk
[1:47:35] <SilverInferno3> Do not insult it with upgrades
[1:47:35] <+kira2993> the super shotgun is already SUPER
[1:47:36] <VJdarkworld> heat blast or stun bomb. i prefer stun bomb
[1:47:42] <%GeneralSCPatton> HEAT BLAST
[1:47:44] <%Solidnick18> super shot gunn OP
[1:47:45] <+Javaa01> The SSG is legit the most powerful gun in the game
[1:47:45] <alrobot2014> how could the super shotgun get more disgustingly broken
[1:47:46] <%Irridium> heat blast tho
[1:47:47] <+greenfall> SSG is beautiful as is
[1:47:48] <@Solidus_113> Heat blast is a good "get off me"
[1:47:48] <CuttleCrow> putting mods on it would be HERESY
[1:47:49] <dekkitout> If only SSG had a... hookshot... yeah~
[1:47:50] <Tucker0603> heat blast is fucking rad
[1:47:50] <BusterRepukken> stun bomb is useful
[1:47:51] <dapperskeleton69> @woolieversus the alt fire on super shotty is a small zoom in
[1:47:52] <%Chichen> "aim down sight" for a SHOTGUN
[1:47:54] <OkamiDude15> tactical scope nkoGasm
[1:47:54] <+MalekDracarus> super shotgun is perfect
[1:47:55] <rubbishbinge> SSGSS would be ridiculous
[1:47:56] <dmysta3000> Stun Bomb is great for the shield bois
[1:47:57] <SilverInferno3> @alrobot2014 By attaching a GRAPPLING HOOK
[1:47:59] <@Solidus_113> air cutter
[1:48:05] <+CptnCampy61> Heat blast is like this game’s parry
[1:48:06] <BusterRepukken> stun bomb for shields
[1:48:08] <VJdarkworld> i use the stun bomb specifically for the shield fuckers
[1:48:09] <+Javaa01> Stun Bomb turns off shields
[1:48:09] <%mitchteck> Heat blast is op
[1:48:10] <Vyneci> Either of these is good, but I prefet Heat Blast first
[1:48:15] <Vyneci> prefer*
[1:48:16] <%GeneralSCPatton> HEAT BLAST IS GREAT
[1:48:16] <%Irridium> both are good but heat blast tho
[1:48:17] <+fizzguy47> admire its purity
[1:48:18] <sleepy_pixels> Stun bomb also breaks sheilds
[1:48:20] <NickHatesSnow> heat blast is godlike
[1:48:22] <+PleasantLeech> you can zoom in slightly that's it
[1:48:24] <+Mumbles519> both are decent so either is fine
[1:48:26] <SilverInferno3> Both are good
[1:48:27] <Djinnazz> Heat Blast!
[1:48:29] <%wujak> heat blast is a big aoe
[1:48:29] <MayorRev> stun then shoot
[1:48:30] <+dosan121> heat blast is more useful in arena fights
[1:48:31] <dekkitout> @rubbishbinge Super Shougun Super Shot
[1:48:32] <Tucker0603> heat blast is a GTFO button
[1:48:35] <NaturalGear> stun bomb removes shield from turtle enemies
[1:48:35] <%king_wragles> Plasma rifle is REALLY good when you max both upgrades
[1:48:36] <%GeneralSCPatton> Heat Blast is a safe Aoe
[1:48:38] <Quietshun13> nothing wrong with more power in this game
[1:48:39] <youlookokgetin> you always need MORE SCHUT
[1:48:45] <Graxe_> Super Shotgun Super Shot

[1:49:04] <+CptnCampy61> He chose wisely

[3:12:33] <SheefEatsBeef> there are no keycards in hell only skull
[3:12:36] <%mh9s> DOOM feels gud
[3:12:36] <lexitheshark> Some of the DOOM OST isn't even available on Spotify, YouTube, or CDs. Some is exclusive to in game
[3:12:39] <%fattness132> By the end of this game, you will feel like a god
[3:12:46] <Alef321> @WoolieVersus woolie, did you know Doomguy is as tall as Pat ?
[3:12:49] <Personified134> and if you have HUGE GUNS
[3:13:08] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> The right gun for all situations: The Super Shotgun
[3:13:09] <jeffthesequel> "You can't kill me, I'll kill myself!" LUL
[3:13:11] <MyNameIsRasus> The problem last session was you didn't have enough G U N
[3:13:22] <a1337spy> have you two seen the video of mick gordon giving a talk at gdc about how he made the music for this
[3:13:24] <+paladinstarbuster> I get lost here too
[3:13:27] <%realm_forge> The devs described it as combat chess
[3:13:29] <Personified134> almost any problem can be solved with additional GUN
[3:13:40] <+Javaa01> @NewAndTastySixthHouse And also Siege Mode, for when the problem is slightly farther away
[3:13:49] <dapperskeleton69> @a1337spy didnt he literally use a chainsaw and an old russian sound mixer
[3:13:52] <%RioGascar> And then theres the THE G U N
[3:13:55] <%RioGascar> that GUN
[3:13:59] <%RioGascar> you know the one
[3:14:06] <MyNameIsRasus> That's a phrase you don't want your mom to hear
[3:14:08] <a1337spy> @dapperskeleton69 not just that
[3:14:08] <cheesedburgers> Siege mode, also known as the Delete key
[3:14:12] <%croxeye> blue key needed
[3:14:14] <ihateyouo> blue
[3:14:15] <+Javaa01> Blue Sigil
[3:14:16] <+PleasantLeech> blue
[3:14:16] <johnnybelmont_95> DOOM equals GUN
[3:14:16] <a1337spy> it was the sound of the chainsaw from classic doom
[3:14:16] <@Solidus_113> The song that just played is called "Damnation"
[3:14:18] <CoffeeSlice> BLUE
[3:14:19] <pi_in_the_sci> BLUE SKULL
[3:14:23] <alexandrecau> blue minh
[3:14:28] <a1337spy> and the opening pitch for the music was no guitars
[3:14:28] <ihateyouo> Sigil is a good game
[3:14:35] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Blueminh Onion?
[3:14:36] <+PleasantLeech> wow and you make fun of Minh for being color blind
[3:14:47] <BusterRepukken> wrath, dusk and amid evil are good shooters
[3:14:51] <%Brightstreak> awwww yeah it's doom time baby!!!!
[3:15:14] <+Javaa01> I think you get that rune later
[3:15:18] <OkamiDude15> Thanks for the LuvPeekR @generalscpatton
[3:15:18] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Dusk in particular was probably my favorite of the recent old timey styled shooters, probably because it's most like Blood, which was my favorite of the actual old timey FPS's.
[3:15:51] <+ProtoShawk> Dusk is fucking phenomenal
[3:15:59] <%realm_forge> The levels do a lot of cross crossing so you’ll get the opportunity for each secret if you keep your eyes open
[3:16:12] <%Brightstreak> how long have they been streaming?
[3:16:13] <FirewallStorm> in the combat Arena there's a high floating platform you can jump on
[3:16:18] <dapperskeleton69> !uptime
[3:16:18] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 16 minutes
[3:16:18] <+Javaa01> Blood is a peak boomer shooter, but it's also fucked up in terms of raw difficulty, even among it's contemporaries
[3:16:18] <%croxeye> you'll come back to it, you'll just need to proceed
[3:16:22] <xbb1024> I remember when I played this game, all the secret hunting kinda kills the pacing
[3:16:24] <johnnybelmont_95> Yeah the level opens up later
[3:16:37] <%GeneralSCPatton> YOU WANT THE HELL LORE
[3:16:37] <%Brightstreak> that door doesn't open yet, woolie. I was playing this level earlier today
[3:16:48] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> @Javaa01 You just gotta learn how to duck and dive and also become a powerful master of the dynamite, then Blood evens out lol
[3:16:48] <dapperskeleton69> @xbb1024 yeah but its for the OGs who enjoy that
[3:17:02] <%croxeye> you just need to progress, the level loops around itself
[3:17:08] <%Brightstreak> keep going, it'll open
[3:17:08] <%Irridium> you will circle back here by going forward
[3:17:18] <+imporia_> let them secret hunt chat
[3:17:24] <%Brightstreak> ok
[3:17:25] <+Javaa01> @NewAndTastySixthHouse At least until it decides to throw a dozen hitscanners at you at once
[3:17:28] <resloxxx> This level likes to loop around as you pick up the skullkeys, dont worry the doors will start opening as you progress @WoolieVersus

[3:22:51] <+mechslayer71> The grass cannon is broken when the siege mode is fully upgraded @woolieversus
[3:22:59] <%mistersups> Burned by the embers of Armageddon
[3:23:00] <VJdarkworld> since i never played doom 2 till after, i didnt realize the summoners are based upon arch-viles
[3:23:04] <dapperskeleton69> lol grass cannon
[3:23:05] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> I love the super shotgun just blasting parts off lmao
[3:23:08] <SilverInferno3> @Brightstreak I think that's because IIRC difficulty modes don't change damage or health, it only changes how many enemies attack you at once
[3:23:14] <Personified134> guys let him have the organic pop off when he opens that upgrade menu and sees SIEGE MODE

[4:14:33] <%kyh9> I think Woolie streams are like lets-play ASMR. very calm and relaxing usually
[4:14:40] <alrobot2014> @GraceTBM yep special edition
[4:14:42] <%GraceTBM> skyrim is an 8/10 classic

[4:15:34] <+paladinstarbuster> WHENS FRONT MISSION
[4:15:43] <SilverInferno3> RAILGUNS ARE THE BEST
[4:15:46] <fist_wizard_jay> tbh I didnt follow the Death Stranding playthrough, but I am catching up on the vids slowly and enjoying it!

[4:15:50] <uncle_christian> Navy has Rail Gun
[4:15:53] <dreu81> quake 2 railgun best railgun
[4:16:01] <+Javaa01> Magnets
[4:16:01] <karl_rex> Shouldn't a railgun not have recoil?
[4:16:02] <%TubeMan642> woolieMIRIN woolieMIRIN_HF
[4:16:03] <@Solidus_113> MAGNETS
[4:16:03] <%GraceTBM> it's the strongest single fire high damage gun type
[4:16:09] <+paladinstarbuster> misaka mikoto IS best girl
[4:16:10] <%GraceTBM> therefore the most satisfying
[4:16:10] <worldbrand> oh cool thanks for the emote @lancerous007
[4:16:13] <uncle_christian> XD
[4:16:14] <fist_wizard_jay> LOL
[4:16:14] <Tucker0603> railguns, Gauss cannons, and mass drivers are my fucking favorite
[4:16:15] <phatmac16> Mikasa the railgun best gurl
[4:16:18] <%kyh9> Rather than pushing it, you pull it. Rail Cannon's are much more of slingshots
[4:16:22] <StarlitStunner> Mass Acceleration Cannon

[0:04:09] <NarcissistCactus> what
[0:04:09] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Dio_TR
[0:04:12] <BallinArbiter> This game is pretty short. He’ll probably be close to the end by the time he’s done with the stream
[0:04:12] <%augusm> This is the best "An unexpected surprise, but a pleasant one to be sure." I've had since Pat played Vampire: The Masquerade
[0:04:15] <+zepelinnn1> jesus this train shit is the worst

[0:04:45] <+QueequegTheater> QueequegTheater subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! Yay it's been a year. Woolie, for Spec Ops I have two pieces of advice: first, DON'T LOOK AT CHAT AT ALL
[0:04:50] <+QueequegTheater> WAIT SHIT
[0:04:59] <Thorlias> are we going to get a LA noir deterioration of woolieS mental psyche

[0:06:36] <Andrei11Droasca> I think Reggie is the one looking at the chat so it should be fine
[0:06:38] <fist_wizard_jay> I humbly request that Woolie/mods mute chat forever
[0:06:51] <+QueequegTheater> It's because anonymity gives neckbeard virgins the ability to feel like their penis is more than three inches by spoiling things for other people
[0:06:54] <fist_wizard_jay> for safety
[0:06:56] <%gatorafan> but yeah, this one's going to be weird with chat daedra1DerpyTibs
[0:07:11] <NarcissistCactus> fukin virgins 😤

[0:26:07] <Prevot> baseball is the worst sport ever
[0:26:13] <+Genericmistake> one outs is a baseball anime is like calling TTGL a mech anime
[0:26:14] <muniea3> spoiler this game features specs, ops and lines
[0:26:16] <zamzoph> Girls und Panzer best sports anime
[0:26:17] <+WordsHere> Watch Touch tomatoSmile
[0:26:17] <deviljhojho_> what about cricket
[0:26:23] <%Lion_kun> It's a good anime, it's made in the Kaiji/Alagi style
[0:26:24] <%gatorafan> OH That's not a BASEBALL!!! FeelsBadMan
[0:26:24] <+QueequegTheater> Baseball is only bad if you're sober
[0:26:26] <floralkami> yeah, but it's Baseball....
[0:26:27] <Sunstalker> ROOKIEs Pog
[0:26:37] <CrazyMedicine> Captain Tsubasa is a good soccer anime

[0:26:42] <+White_n0ize> @isacdee the Line killed us cuz the true Spec Ops was the friends we made along the way
[0:26:43] <+fingalights> Anime makes anything hype
[0:26:47] <deviljhojho_> i watched tsubasa all the time when I was a tyke
[0:27:07] <+locutus_of_the_porg> woolie before you play get a bucket of sand and dunk your head charlsJolly
[0:27:09] <dukenux> Captain Tsubasa is a classic, but probably only if you grew up in a country that plays footie
[0:27:16] <Dova573> I would watch Captain tsubasa when I got off elementary school back in mexico
[0:27:18] <Run44forrest> woolie wont even watch hxh WeirdChamp
[0:27:24] <coreybom> Baseball is FUN to play, BORING AS HELL to watch.
[0:27:27] <%Lion_kun> One outs has an episode about sign stealing.

[0:27:29] <deviljhojho_> yeah i dont think most folk from the states were too into it
[0:27:37] <Prevot> the real question is when will nintendo bless us with a new Mario Strikers
[0:27:40] <deviljhojho_> it was mostly a latin america-europe thing outside of japan
[0:27:44] <spooksy> i think it's pretty obvious you will enjoy a sports anime more if youve played the sport a little bit
[0:27:46] <floralkami> fed on sports animes
[0:27:51] <derap41> Spec Ops is a curious beast because it doesn't really work if you know what it does. You have to be unaware for it to really hit
[0:27:53] <deviljhojho_> i still watched it tho
[0:27:56] <vVAstrAVv> is THIS the new lp?

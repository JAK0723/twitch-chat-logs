[0:22:53] <Rangenade> its like thinking about the game "game"
[0:22:55] <+gustavozxd> I had a lucid dream once and it was kinda cool cause I could pay more attention to the details but I couldn't even move
[0:23:15] <tigerspath> hey chat, is minh okay? he looks upset to me.

[0:24:06] <BallerSwagBro9k> Ah....THOSE dreams LUL
[0:24:09] <+TitaniumDragoonNeo> Back at the end of high school, I trained myself to do the "god of my dreamworld" thing. Though the stress of college threw that completely out the window in terms of my skills.
[0:24:16] <%IMDRanged> I was expecting a party.... um ok
[0:24:16] <MichaelDood> Woah! Dem lights!
[0:24:16] <+liquidzr0> ah dreams...back to sleep
[0:24:18] <FeelinNifty> I was half-awake when I wrote last night's dream in my dream journal. I checked it earlier today. It says "horse-mounted gatling gun nightmare"
[0:24:24] <%optimasmaximas> 12 to 5? time to die :)
[0:24:33] <+hopsoverfrogs> Why is there so much camera space? Lol
[0:24:52] <WG101> i remember having a dream where pat and woolie just walk in on me closing a window in my underwear
[0:24:52] <@Solidus_113> and then 1 to 8 is when you're a dying husk of a human being, a slave to the graveyard

I had a lucid dream this morning, and it freaked me the fuck out because it involved me pulling a botfly larva out of my wrist. When I woke up, I had to check my wrist to make sure it was not infested!
[0:26:29] <plushysceptile> The salt party continues
[0:26:31] <+Toblo1> Like dream will swerve into something I recognize then the *MILISECOND* I go "wait I'm dreaming aren't I?" it fucking ends

[0:29:00] <+einheri> Your voices are smooth
[0:29:01] <BallerSwagBro9k> Big audio stutter OOF
[0:29:03] <shotgang86> before the game launched it was ok
[0:29:04] <DracaenaLeaf> your own video is a little choppy though too
[0:29:07] <VJdarkworld> game audio sounds like a chopped n screwed remix
[0:29:12] <redrins> game but camera had some slight skips
[0:29:15] <+MrAtheGreat> Cam is skipping frames too
[0:29:16] <@chesterr01> @invisi_bliss ‚úäüëä
[0:29:17] <%IMDRanged> Should've invited Pat on this one
[0:29:21] <TwinBat> lol

[0:30:10] <+Xpheius> PowerUpL murderPog PowerUpR
[0:30:16] <Ghost__Pantsu> Video is chopping too or low framerate hmm
[0:30:35] <+TitaniumDragoonNeo> nah you're good. new setup and all that
[0:30:36] <$burgersama_dlx> PokPikachu
[0:30:41] <$cureneckbeard> hold on
[0:30:43] <SleepDeprived42> Perfect game for Woolie. Kiirby. Duh.
[0:30:46] <@Squdnate> Then it's the bitrate
[0:30:46] <redrins> could it be the bitrate?
[0:30:59] <@Solidus_113> Check that task manager
[0:31:00] <Ghost__Pantsu> Bitrate probs
[0:31:04] <themightyquinn3000> Hi Woolie
[0:31:35] <%wolfofsound> woolie stop your shadman torrent
[0:31:46] <+TitaniumDragoonNeo> It likely is a bitrate issue.
[0:31:48] <+Javaa01> Check task manager and look at what speed your CPU is running at, cause of something like thermal throttling or whatever
[0:31:49] <@Solidus_113> the bitrate is still 4500, it's been fine before
[0:31:58] <$burgersama_dlx> how many tabs ya got open? atpCap
[0:32:12] <+MrProw> If it were bitrate then wouldn't their voices be choppy as well? :s
[0:32:14] <invisi_bliss> LUL
[0:32:19] <redrins> @burgersama_dlx not enough
[0:32:24] <NeroInfinite> mmm that choppy game audio
[0:32:32] <$burgersama_dlx> @redrins nani?!
[0:32:37] <$cureneckbeard> too high res
[0:32:40] <$cureneckbeard> 4k woolie was a mistake
[0:32:46] <@Solidus_113> the voices are fine, but the game audio is crunchy, and the camera footage is skipping frames @WoolieVersus
[0:32:46] <DaKnightWarrior> EarthDay PowerUpL TheIlluminati
[0:32:48] <wanocountry> !Uptime
[0:32:48] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 32 minutes and 50 seconds
[0:32:52] <+Ryu_R> minh looks pat sized LUL
[0:32:57] <Potatoidea> Cam setup looks really good
[0:33:09] <@Squdnate> The recommended bitrate for streaming 1080p is also between 5000 and 6000
[0:33:14] <+MrAtheGreat> As an amatuer streamer, this shit is gold to me. Teach me sensei!
[0:33:14] <Aussie_Manny> @Ryu_R But Minh's legs actually have a bend tho.
[0:33:18] <@Squdnate> 4500 is just a bit under for that performance
[0:33:21] <+Ryu_R> true
[0:33:22] <NeroInfinite> 4k Woolie is a mistake
[0:33:28] <Potatoidea> Aside from the tech issues, though
[0:34:00] <Aussie_Manny> Holy shit, I'm streaming at 480p, but these scrubs look SO SHARP! PogChamp
[0:34:06] <@Solidus_113> the same
[0:34:07] <+TitaniumDragoonNeo> nope
[0:34:08] <TwinBat> still crunch
[0:34:09] <some_sunflowers> is bad.
[0:34:10] <%Irridium> same
[0:34:10] <+MrProw> still bad
[0:34:13] <+Javaa01> Yeah, big chops
[0:34:13] <SurgicalAssassin> still choppy
[0:34:14] <DaKnightWarrior> still choppy
[0:34:14] <%Irridium> as in still not good
[0:34:16] <NeroInfinite> cwispy
[0:34:17] <MojoKingIzakku> crackling audio ?
[0:34:18] <scrumbotime> crunchitized
[0:34:26] <redrins> do as squd said and bump the bitrate
[0:34:29] <kuningaz45> check sound equalization
[0:34:34] <MojoKingIzakku> cables?
[0:34:36] <$cureneckbeard> is the camera choppy video framerate for anyone else or is it just my PC sucks
[0:34:42] <%valriot> It literally just sounds like a plug is loose on the actual WiiU
[0:34:49] <zayasu> @cureneckbeard for me too
[0:34:50] <NeroInfinite> jus t yer pc I'm afraid
[0:34:57] <MojoKingIzakku> roger that
[0:34:57] <@Solidus_113> Camera could be taking up too much power
[0:34:58] <liflamor> or maybe the sound is just naturally crappy
[0:34:59] <+Ryu_R> just emulate it Kappa
[0:35:19] <bushbabyomega> Does the game need an update?
[0:35:19] <+DeeJayOkay> E G G M A N
[0:35:23] <$burgersama_dlx> could it be the wii u?
[0:35:23] <+MrAtheGreat> It‚Äôs output issues I think.
[0:35:30] <giogio346> @WoolieVersus the camera is also a bit choppy
[0:35:38] <@Squdnate> @WoolieVersus See your CPU usage. And crank the bitrate to at least 5000
[0:35:43] <@Solidus_113> yes
[0:35:44] <DracaenaLeaf> Yeah
[0:35:45] <VJdarkworld> yeah
[0:35:46] <zmuno> yes
[0:35:46] <Sedrelic> YE
[0:35:46] <+MrProw> very yes
[0:35:48] <%Solidnick18> nothing can ever work FeelsBadMan
[0:35:48] <+Javaa01> Yeah, it is somewhat choppy
[0:35:49] <+MrAtheGreat> Not enough band width maybe
[0:35:49] <%Irridium> your camera yeah game is fine
[0:35:51] <NeroInfinite> Yep
[0:35:51] <$burgersama_dlx> maybe its TOO high quality
[0:35:51] <Phalanx_Soul> did you try turning it off and on
[0:35:53] <%Solidnick18> yeah
[0:36:05] <%CJett92> Game video and your audio is good, Game audio and your video is chunky
[0:36:13] <@Solidus_113> You've skipped 1071 frames since the start of the stream
[0:36:14] <Reizie_Etherealm> This is what happens when you try to deliver more than nothing
[0:36:15] <MojoKingIzakku> not badd tbh
[0:36:20] <+vaporousTippler> Stop all the uploadin'!
[0:36:20] <+MrProw> Turn down camera quality perhaps?
[0:36:24] <+tierst> i think it might be some sort of ghost or curse
[0:36:30] <+Carquar> just needs to be refuckulated
[0:36:31] <+Javaa01> Look at the clockspeed via taskmanager as well, just to see if it's getting throttled or whatever
[0:36:34] <$burgersama_dlx> @vaporousTippler help computer
[0:36:39] <MojoKingIzakku> try 3500? idk
[0:36:59] <CrimsonCore90> Burn it down!!!!

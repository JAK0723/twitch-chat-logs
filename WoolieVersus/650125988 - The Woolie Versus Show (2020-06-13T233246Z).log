[0:10:40] <%LynbellDaYo> my uncle said maybe
[0:10:40] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Only good thing during those 5 hours was P4G and Everspace 2, and that Bullet Hell Ikaruga thing
[0:10:41] <prime_name> There is still the ARMS smash announcement this month.
[0:10:57] <%SuperKirby24> my uncle also said its a possibility Kappa
[0:10:57] <Solidnick18> Ghostrunner looked sick
[0:10:59] <Prevot> I can't belive the Vita finally lost its 1 good game
[0:11:00] <Saltmeisterr> minmin for the winwin
[0:11:22] <dinnydanny777> Yeah Stick Fight The Game is okay but have you heard of Bugsnax?
[0:11:38] <%LynbellDaYo> I would love Dr. Coyle but that's a pipe dream, I'm happy with Min Min though

[0:11:53] <%FuqBoiSlim> Woolie loves you
[0:11:53] <$BallerSwagBro9k> PC SHOW proved that gaming is 90% desd
[0:11:55] <%Dorf1> vita still has muramasa with an actual translation
[0:12:06] <CazadorDeWulf> Isn't the Vita about 6 years old now
[0:12:12] <TomosukeUsagi> lol I remember that sailor moon episode
[0:12:18] <%jinking79> d4c
[0:12:20] <CazadorDeWulf> Or 7
[0:12:20] <petwisk> question from anime watcher for manga readers, does Woolie finished Spark The Electric Jester?
[0:12:24] <+Vigonept> shut up its 6 years I thought it was 20
[0:12:27] <dinnydanny777> The Vita was like 2012 I thought
[0:12:29] <$BallerSwagBro9k> no
[0:12:30] <%FuqBoiSlim> Vita still has Muramasa: Rebirth, Freedom Wars, and Soul Sacrifice
[0:12:31] <%LynbellDaYo> way more than 7, must be
[0:12:35] <prime_name> @petwisk don't think so

[0:13:22] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @petwisk Unlikely
[0:13:26] <Prevot> they say you only die when you're forgotten, so the Vita was never alive at all
[0:13:35] <uncledoodsauce> does ja rule know about the PS5?
[0:13:53] <%Klefth> Man, this Rising Thunder music

[0:14:00] <Matrixvingian> Stick Fight as in the Newgrounds game?
[0:14:02] <%FuqBoiSlim> I bought a vita exclusively for P4G. I feel like a proud father seeing it escape the vita prison
[0:14:03] <dinnydanny777> We should all be waiting for Soulja Boy to release his console because it's gonna blow us all away
[0:14:07] <CazadorDeWulf> Original Vita was 2011 in Japan, 2012 elsewhere, then updated variant in 2013
[0:14:19] <CazadorDeWulf> Says wikipedia

[0:18:42] <BoneBagMel> It's ok
[0:18:42] <Matrixvingian> Not bad with the anti clap I couldn't hear those cheeks.
[0:18:42] <+b_aleph> sounds LOW
[0:18:44] <%Klefth> Yeah, but your voice sounds off
[0:18:44] <ferretinatux> hewwo
[0:18:45] <arikk42> you sound like you are in a much smaller box
[0:18:46] <%Zayasu> KonCha
[0:18:49] <Leafboi125> I wonder what mihn said?
[0:18:49] <Visorak6> Yeah it does but it definitely deletes some of the voice range
[0:18:49] <BoneBagMel> You can get used to it, no worries.
[0:18:51] <%generalve> im confused though, you barley had background noise to begin with ?
[0:18:54] <+griffball13> it's fiiiine
[0:18:55] <@Solidus_113> The tin is because it's silencing the claps
[0:18:56] <+CJett92> its not bad
[0:18:57] <CazadorDeWulf> No way?
[0:18:57] <+b_aleph> I wanna hear them big claps
[0:18:57] <Kalcom> filtered voice
[0:19:00] <+Vigonept> wanna try it with it off?
[0:19:01] <+MajorCrasher> it's because your mic sucks
[0:19:03] <Dingalow> I did not hear those claps, that's mental
[0:19:03] <@Solidus_113> the AI works, but it's never perfect
[0:19:05] <%Lion_kun> Ask pat about his audio settings
[0:19:07] <%ekodrop> for some reason it's worse for you than i've heard elsewhere
[0:19:07] <neraren> Youre still totally understandable
[0:19:10] <damascussteele> Iheard sound of one hand clapping
[0:19:13] <dinnydanny777> bugsnax
[0:19:15] <BoneBagMel> It's understandable
[0:19:15] <Matrixvingian> Is there high volume nature show activities bleeding in?
[0:19:16] <Kalcom> Minh voice is the same, how
[0:19:18] <%eyezehuhh> this is a good ass looking apartment
[0:19:18] <+bionic_hippo> doesn't sound bad, just different. cool that it blocks background noise
[0:19:23] <+Shinsasu> now your wive can cry in the background an we'll never know
[0:19:29] <neraren> Its supposed to get better the more you use it, it learns
[0:19:36] <%gamewarden92> the talking sounds ok right now
[0:19:39] <BoneBagMel> Yeah we can understand u perfectly. No background noises is great. All good guys
[0:19:42] <%ekodrop> nah it still sounds muddy when you're talking normally
[0:19:42] <CazadorDeWulf> If you could turn overall volume up on your mics that would be perfect
[0:19:43] <Triplicat> RTX ON
[0:19:48] <BoneBagMel> maybe turn it up a tad
[0:19:48] <+CJett92> damn, I still think thats magic

[0:20:07] <Visorak6> Wait no it still sounds the same even with the filter off
[0:20:09] <+CJett92> Audio isnt bad, its fiiiiiiiiiine
[0:20:10] <+b_aleph> But how he gonna hear dem cheeks clapping???
[0:20:12] <neraren> Hold a note and then turn it on
[0:20:13] <+MajorCrasher> your mic is tinny with it off too
[0:20:14] <+tearfuldevil> @Helix_Snake nope

[0:20:22] <Thornbad> the tin's a bit... hard for me to listen to, but i got... auditory issues
[0:20:27] <CazadorDeWulf> Yep filter on is fine, the volume is just low af
[0:20:29] <%Klefth> The weirdness in the voice is still there when you turned it off. You kinda sound like the skeleton blacksmith in DS1
[0:20:30] <%scrublord009> ITS FINE
[0:20:31] <@Solidus_113> the only problem right now is possibly losing laughs and some screaming with the AI
[0:20:31] <prime_name> There are just a few moments of wonky mic quality is all.
[0:20:33] <Kalcom> sounds weird without filter

[0:21:36] <Kalcom> don't care bout background noise but do whatever is good
[0:21:38] <+MajorCrasher> it's definitely Woolie's mic. mihn sounds fine and the tin is still there when you turn it off

[0:22:57] <Kalcom> it's not the filter
[0:23:00] <dinnydanny777> Woolie's mic is a bit static sounding
[0:23:08] <Kalcom> he tried without it
[0:23:08] <+TreeeFOX> yes
[0:23:09] <BoneBagMel> Reggie, tap your mic
[0:23:12] <CazadorDeWulf> The tinny is not the filter, something wrong with Woolie's mic in particular

[0:24:24] <neraren> Talk into reggies mic to see if its te mic or you
[0:24:29] <BoneBagMel> Maybe it's the tone of voice it self, don't worry too much about it

[0:34:23] <@akuda_bar> @dinnydanny777 Nigel
[0:34:28] <%gamewarden92> kevin?
[0:34:29] <FazzleRazzle> keith
[0:34:31] <TheDuelistsChapeau> Dick
[0:34:34] <$Superdandy96> Kyle?
[0:34:38] <f4ntom98> Richard
[0:34:40] <%Zayasu> @MyNameIsRasus its pretty good. just the audio in the cutscenes is kinda bad
[0:34:41] <+oda_flobunaga> MGS 5 and Duke Nukem 4ever
[0:34:41] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Hype is silly.
[0:34:47] <+Ardisan_> A game taking too long to come out stopped boring me because I have so much games to play still.
[0:34:48] <+oda_flobunaga> ffXV
[0:34:50] <MyNameIsRasus> @f4ntom98 MICHAEELL
[0:34:58] <Prevot> kyle
[0:34:58] <f4ntom98> That's a good one
[0:34:59] <+Ardisan_> bothering me not boring
[0:35:04] <dinnydanny777> Sounds like The last of us 2
[0:35:11] <MyNameIsRasus> @Zayasu As long as it's not crashing I'll take what I can get
[0:35:12] <%fangovafang> wats good yall
[0:35:20] <f4ntom98> What's good!
[0:35:23] <+cdrom321> @dinnydanny777 "Asshole"
[0:35:28] <@akuda_bar> where's SMT5.
[0:35:32] <%kyh9> It will come and so will I
[0:35:39] <+oda_flobunaga> Star Citizen?
[0:35:58] <+Ardisan_> SMT5 do far is probsbly the biggest offender for this.
[0:35:59] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Every job has deadlines. Meet them.
[0:36:01] <$Superdandy96> SMT5, I totally forgot about that. Kinda like Metroid Prime 4
[0:36:07] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Look, if the game is better for the wait then I'm willing to wait
[0:36:17] <%BearSawed> Hahahahahah Star citizen, I havent heard that name in many years
[0:36:24] <+HollowMan190> And if it's no
[0:36:26] <Dingalow> Doesn't Platinum typically have a good work ethic?
[0:36:27] <+HollowMan190> not
[0:36:35] <Solidnick18> it wasn't promised
[0:36:35] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:36:47] <Prevot> the mario rabbids leak was the worst, the devs had a plan to convince people it was good nd some asshole just blew it all out
[0:36:47] <%fangovafang> have they played power rangers battle for the grid yet?
[0:36:52] <+jiggy_snipe> Miyamoto said
[0:36:54] <+oda_flobunaga> Star Citizen is still in Alpha after like 10 years of constant work
[0:36:54] <MyNameIsRasus> If you can't meet a deadline that you agreed to (assuming you had actual agency in setting that deadline) then you failed
[0:37:08] <$Superdandy96> So I can add Tekken x Street Fighter into the void... sigh. panicBasket
[0:37:09] <Finakala> Triple-I is a good title
[0:37:14] <+zooeymainbtw> haha star citizen and constant work
[0:37:17] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Indie games are constantly coming out, and there are some real gems out there
[0:37:22] <dinnydanny777> Are Indie games not the most common type of game at this point
[0:37:24] <FazzleRazzle> but shut up i want the thing that i wanted and i want it to be they way i expected
[0:37:24] <f4ntom98> Wow Triple I? That's a news to me
[0:37:30] <+oda_flobunaga> sorry, constant "development"
[0:37:30] <%pectusumbra> SMT V IS JUST REAL LIFE
[0:37:31] <MyNameIsRasus> Triple I is strong
[0:37:32] <%BearSawed> Star citizen also has no money and screws workers if I remember correctly
[0:37:38] <Triplicat> DMCVSE
[0:37:44] <+ggbhtg> @fangovafang Back before the low block patch, soooo they really need to play Power Rangers Grid a 2nd time
[0:37:49] <Dingalow> Delays are a good sign to me. Metroid Prime 4, I'm glad to hear is getting more development time, that tells me they do not want to fuck this up

[0:39:51] <@akuda_bar> "I would stand up for the cashier!" is better than "i'd punch that lady."

[1:35:43] <Solidnick18> yee
[1:35:45] <rcand9> reggie won but minh can have it LUL
[1:35:46] <Hammatime8> Stick fight has some sick beats for sure
[1:36:02] <%Plus_On_Black> Reggu won it all
[1:36:09] <CorgiRiderCorki> party game
[1:36:09] <+tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus btw, RTX acts really wierd whenever you all are loud (shouting, laughing, otherwise getting hype) at once
[1:36:12] <f4ntom98> That was a great game guys
[1:36:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yeah, the RTX was funky.
[1:36:26] <f4ntom98> RTX kills pop OFFS
[1:36:31] <+nintega010> now fortune street
[1:36:33] <Solidnick18> alright next game FeelsGoodMan
[1:36:36] <rcand9> persona 4 on pc is great playing it atm
[1:36:39] <MrMediocrity> so my boy reggie clearly would win any game. Do you just let him have 5 mins at the end with your feet to let it go or what?
[1:36:44] <%gamewarden92> Woolie's laugh is too pure for RTX. A human coud not make such a perfect sound.
[1:37:01] <prime_name> Whatcha typing Woolz?
[1:37:02] <%fizzguy47> Wha happun to Woolie's Gamercube?
[1:37:07] <%DSD24> Oh did I miss Stick Fight?
[1:37:09] <CorgiRiderCorki> Reggie says "hydrate, or die-drate!"
[1:37:14] <%crossing_mao> RTX kicks little dogs
[1:37:23] <%Zayasu> yes its annoying
[1:37:30] <+YabbaTroll> yeah todays audio is weird
[1:37:31] <RunningNGunning> Yes its not good
[1:37:32] <+jiggy_snipe> yep
[1:37:33] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah
[1:37:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yes
[1:37:33] <Solidnick18> yes
[1:37:33] <prime_name> yep
[1:37:34] <%Josef_Stryker> Yeah
[1:37:35] <@Solidus_113> RTX Voice is also fucking with the laughs and "oohhhh's"
[1:37:35] <CorgiRiderCorki> group consensus
[1:37:35] <+tearfuldevil> it kills the hype
[1:37:36] <%gamewarden92> it's different
[1:37:37] <+dmtjinni> yub
[1:37:38] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> It's turdy poo poo
[1:37:39] <Visorak6> It kills your hype
[1:37:39] <DedlokPM> yes it is a consensus
[1:37:40] <+jiggy_snipe> it was happening on Thursday too
[1:37:41] <+aishman> Yawp yawp
[1:37:41] <%BisoromiBear> it's a hype killer
[1:37:45] <%Javaa01> Yes it doesn't know how to handle the room echo
[1:37:46] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> There's something weird about it.
[1:37:47] <+nintega010> yeah. felt like it's cutting out other people
[1:37:49] <Hammatime8> Yea RTX is messing with stuff a bit
[1:37:50] <prime_name> Pop-Offs get muted
[1:37:53] <Solidnick18> i think it's not great i like hearing the rukus
[1:37:54] <+EldritchBee> Its like *pop off* OOOuuuhh~
[1:37:55] <+tearfuldevil> its not meant for thuggery
[1:38:00] <f4ntom98> RTX is a hype killer thats all not in a group
[1:38:04] <Solidnick18> it does it's job
[1:38:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> @tearfuldevil ^
[1:38:06] <startstoprepeat> it's built with a single user in mind
[1:38:08] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Maybe it's too many people. If you were alone or something.
[1:38:10] <Solidnick18> yeah
[1:38:12] <+Kenidashi> RTX Audio works great w/ a single person. Not so hot when in a group environment.
[1:38:20] <+dmtjinni> not too bad imo tbh
[1:38:21] <black_pariah> maybe if mihn wasnt popping off every three seconds
[1:38:23] <%gamewarden92> sometimes your laugh gets censored.
[1:38:25] <%GrassCannon> I've heard you all cut out multiple times
[1:38:27] <prime_name> It tries to dampen the sound way too much
[1:38:28] <RunningNGunning> Sounds like you're underwater or super quiet
[1:38:29] <f4ntom98> Yup, underwater quality
[1:38:30] <black_pariah> i kid
[1:38:32] <%Josef_Stryker> Everytime u guys raise ur voice it quiets down
[1:38:33] <DedlokPM> @WoolieVersus A lot of the time it cuts off the audio when you guys go loud
[1:38:33] <+Kenidashi> It tries to isolate a single voice, and the more you talk the smarter it gets at doing that...for a single voice.
[1:38:34] <atyerservice> Why is there a timer next to the viewer number?
[1:38:34] <@Solidus_113> The AI can't decide between cutting it out or keeping it, so it just turns to garbage
[1:38:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> Underwater and muffled.
[1:38:36] <CorgiRiderCorki> it sounds super warped, or the audio just cuts out entirely
[1:38:39] <%Javaa01> It thinks *everything* in the room is noise it should be filtering out
[1:38:45] <+tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus if one person is talking, and then the others are going "ooooh" or laughing, the others get dimmed/muted
[1:38:48] <%Arek_1> @WoolieVersus RTX Audio kills Max's Homer yells.
[1:38:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yeah, it cut out laughs multiple times.
[1:38:49] <Solidnick18> yeah it just cancels out loud laughter
[1:39:13] <atyerservice> Why is there a timer next to the viewer count in the corner?
[1:39:13] <+dmtjinni> insane
[1:39:19] <DedlokPM> minh kinda sounds off right now audio wise
[1:39:21] <%Klefth> Yeah, it'd be best if you can check it yourself, but it almost sounds like the sound of others gets compressed when someone is too loud
[1:39:31] <%Klefth> And Woolie sounds kinda staticky all the time
[1:39:33] <MrMediocrity> @WoolieVersus so my boy reggie clearly would win any game. Do you just let him have 5 mins at the end with your feet to let it go or what?
[1:39:34] <black_pariah> @atyerservice thats how the streams been running
[1:39:41] <+tearfuldevil> @atyerservice do you mean enxt to the viewers? thats stream runtime
[1:39:44] <+EldritchBee> @WoolieVersus Yeah, I suggest giving today's stream a listen to get the true experience
[1:39:46] <prime_name> Rip RTX
[1:39:48] <f4ntom98> We're sorry Woolz, but the experiment was worth it
[1:39:55] <%gamewarden92> I think RTX could come back in the future
[1:39:56] <%Wool> RTX got canceled for the summer, and now they've canceled RTX
[1:39:58] <atyerservice> Oh, I didn't notice it was going up @tearfuldevil
[1:40:00] <%SuperKirby24> rip in pepperoni
[1:40:00] <+EldritchBee> Now you know!
[1:40:02] <Ragnorok64> It's technically still in beta
[1:40:03] <Solidnick18> it's almost their
[1:40:04] <@Solidus_113> It's still technically in Beta, isn't it?
[1:40:04] <%GrassCannon> As TeamFourStar once said, "If you're over the age of 18 and haven't heard the word 'fuck' before... well, you have now"
[1:40:05] <Hammatime8> It was worth a shot :/
[1:40:06] <Solidnick18> i feel you
[1:40:07] <+nintega010> rtx is good for fighting games
[1:40:13] <%Klefth> Well, it's still in beta. It'll probably improve down the line

[1:40:31] <%ekodrop> yeah when you talk normally. it's cool
[1:40:36] <prime_name> It happens a bit less when its Two people
[1:40:53] <CorgiRiderCorki> mood lighting

[1:51:09] <%FuqBoiSlim> ok dis hard
[1:51:15] <%DappercatEsquire> God this art style is offputting
[1:51:15] <+worldbrand> this is the best 2008 game ive ever seen
[1:51:20] <CorgiRiderCorki> very Power Rangers sounding
[1:51:31] <CorgiRiderCorki> MorphinTime MorphinTime
[1:51:35] <%BisoromiBear> press x to not die
[1:51:36] <%fizzguy47> this sounds like old Power Rangers music
[1:51:37] <%SuperKirby24> ESPECIALLY THAT GUITAR
[1:51:42] <%TheBenson8r> Are we sure this isn't just some long lost Newgrounds game?!
[1:51:50] <%LynbellDaYo> was that awesome face
[1:51:50] <%Plus_On_Black> I hate the art but it's hard tho.
[1:52:11] <Prevot> just give this a DBZ coat of paint
[1:52:17] <+jiggy_snipe> this art kinda fits the gameplay in a weird way
[1:52:26] <%SuperKirby24> can you mod this? Kappa
[1:52:27] <%Wool> everything goes hard but the art
[1:52:28] <%fizzguy47> Gameplay vs Graphics
[1:52:41] <%DappercatEsquire> It is Xbox Live Indie Games from the 360 era
[1:52:46] <masterfire23> this game needs mugen level mods
[1:52:46] <+DeaconBluesClues> I feel the flipside of "picking a character you think looks cool" is you lock youself out of shit with cool gameplay thatl ooks stupid
[1:52:48] <Valentinius_Anodyne> This music is real fun
[1:53:12] <Solidnick18> yea
[1:53:17] <%BisoromiBear> maybe he got the idea for the game while in a decade long coma
[1:53:32] <jellssssss20> hey chat, what do i need to know just comingin now?

[2:15:14] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> One Piece is cool, it's just lengthy.
[2:15:17] <Solidnick18> it's alright
[2:15:17] <Leafboi125> No
[2:15:18] <%jase__x> WATCH ONE PIECE COWARDS
[2:15:21] <%jase__x> READ IT
[2:15:26] <Ragnorok64> One Piece is the best
[2:15:27] <+cowkid222> snake midna is interesting
[2:15:27] <Monkeyweed21> its great just SUPER LONG
[2:15:28] <%BisoromiBear> It's good when it's good

[2:15:32] <+fetrigon> One Piece is great
[2:15:33] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:15:33] <+tearfuldevil> READ IT COWARDS (don't watch it)
[2:15:34] <Mr_Rakjo> ONE PIECE IS GREAT
[2:15:37] <Knight_Lautrec> im at episode 558 of one piece, its fun but a lot of points are a slog
[2:15:38] <+fetrigon> wtf
[2:15:40] <%Jpshum> I love one piece
[2:15:44] <cherrycottontail> the first couple seasons are good but it's bad after a while
[2:15:44] <+GenesisKnight> People read War and Peace tho
[2:15:46] <jellssssss20> @atyerservice I didn't know that, lnao
[2:15:51] <Leafboi125> One Piece :(
[2:15:53] <%jase__x> Only watch one piece when you wanna see the cool fight moment
[2:15:58] <%FuqBoiSlim> One Piece more like One big piece of shit amirite boys
[2:15:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> Minh blowing Reggie the fuck up.
[2:15:58] <alephalpha> read stuff like ins earch of lost time or umineko
[2:15:58] <Solidnick18> i'm at episode 558 wat you mean
[2:16:02] <alephalpha> stop being cowards
[2:16:07] <%emperordread> Boo @ OnePiece
[2:16:08] <%kyh9> One Piece is the best of the Big Three
[2:16:13] <%Dorf1> the snake had a sharingan for a second
[2:16:15] <+Idziman> if one piece wasnt good it wouldnt be going on for 20+ years
[2:16:15] <atyerservice> @jellssssss20 If someone could reverse engineer the servers, it might be active again.
[2:16:18] <+GenesisKnight> Does that snake have a sharingan
[2:16:21] <%NickHatesSnow> One Piece is popping off hard rn
[2:16:22] <+cdrom321> Why did they stop Stick Fight?
[2:16:23] <Leafboi125> ResidentSleeper
[2:16:27] <+RealThiele> gork sez stop
[2:16:30] <%kyh9> One Piece wins the Weekly Shonen Jump contest by value of not having shit the bed horribly yet
[2:16:31] <%BearSawed> one piece is the most consistent of the old big 3
[2:16:33] <+Itselguapo> Oh so you weren't even at that good shit yet.
[2:16:44] <Mr_Rakjo> Stick fight doesnt have a stop point @cdrom321
[2:16:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> @kyh9 For how long it's been going, that's a feat.
[2:16:59] <Prevot> motherfuckers out here reading berserk which probably wont even end and one piece is too long LUL
[2:17:01] <%jase__x> you watch One Piece for the adventure not the ending.
[2:17:02] <+tearfuldevil> @BearSawed i mean the "old big 3" is only a thing in NA
[2:17:03] <+cdrom321> @Mr_Rakjo Oh, yeah. I forgot about that part.
[2:17:08] <CorgiRiderCorki> one piece wins by doing absolutely nothing
[2:17:12] <+jetjagger222> anyone else get a bit nauseated on how this looks and animates
[2:17:14] <+RealThiele> captain planet WINS
[2:17:20] <+fetrigon> @jase__x exactly
[2:17:42] <Dova573> tbf One piece will probaly end in next five years, Probaly
[2:17:45] <Leafboi125> It do
[2:17:52] <+GenesisKnight> I think that snake has a mangekyo
[2:17:53] <%kyh9> Yeah, behind the helmet is asharingan
[2:17:55] <+tearfuldevil> there was huuuuuge power gap in sales and popularity between nart, bleahc, and one piece in japan, basically from the begininng
[2:17:56] <+Itselguapo> I don't know about this game, Active reload, and mashing while flying around in circles is pretty much the entire game.
[2:17:59] <Dova573> But for sure we are on the last parts of the story
[2:18:03] <%FuqBoiSlim> I dont care how bored quarantine makes me. I'm never reading WanPiss and that's a fact. woolieLORE
[2:18:07] <blackskulldragon18> this look like something Ok Ko would do
[2:18:20] <zenith0111> He's zoning PogChamp
[2:18:21] <lazuli_alter> yo the new DBZ game looks sick
[2:18:25] <+nintega010> @fuqboislim it's ok to be wrong
[2:18:27] <+Thatghostpepper> if you can stomach dynasty clones but want to catch up to one piece, try the pirate warriors series
[2:18:30] <+RealThiele> with some cleaning this could be divekick levels good
[2:18:33] <+tearfuldevil> @FuqBoiSlim good for you, nobody cares
[2:18:38] <+Itselguapo> Pirate warriors 3 is good shit
[2:18:44] <+Itselguapo> 4th one is okay.
[2:18:50] <+fetrigon> NO
[2:18:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> REGGIE!
[2:18:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> YES
[2:18:55] <CorgiRiderCorki> I feel like if it wasn't a tired meme artstyle, and something equally as colorful and stylized like maybe Adventure Time it would be more palatable
[2:18:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> REGGIE THE KIND
[2:18:56] <alephalpha> oh no

[2:23:50] <+jetjagger222> @FuqBoiSlim my thoughts exactly
[2:23:54] <jellssssss20> Have you read Irredeemable/Incorruptible @WoolieVersus ?any thoughts?
[2:24:17] <atyerservice> We need some lore, DANGIT!
[2:24:18] <Renkage> Shonen Anime version of this game
[2:24:24] <+jetjagger222> the potential is there but the tone is just super ironic/hipstery
[2:24:28] <+RealThiele> If only we knew the redeeming lore
[2:24:33] <JetpackMcQuack> Give it to Bandai Namco
[2:24:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> woolieLORE Anti-boomer Woolie hating on LORE woolieLORE woolieLORE
[2:24:44] <anita_dickin> FPB is the new KI
[2:24:45] <CorgiRiderCorki> too far into the "ironic" zone
[2:24:50] <+jetjagger222> if they did a tech romancer-esque affectionate parody it would be awesome
[2:25:00] <%redrins> but do you make baby jagos from fighting other ki characters? thought so
[2:25:02] <Solidnick18> that's so old
[2:25:06] <anita_dickin> Whens the Minion getting added?
[2:25:07] <startstoprepeat> woolie's such a derpina
[2:25:10] <+RealThiele> memes age so quickly these days
[2:25:13] <%FuqBoiSlim> I dont think it's ironic. the creator is just 10 years behind
[2:25:13] <+jetjagger222> or maybe i'm just being a boomer
[2:25:16] <Solidnick18> doge
[2:25:24] <+jiggy_snipe> memes die as fast as they are born now
[2:25:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> My dad has a Honey Badger Don't Give a Fuck shirt he still wears.
[2:25:29] <%DappercatEsquire> don't bet on memes if you want people to give a shit
[2:25:29] <CorgiRiderCorki> Minh is the best derpette
[2:25:29] <+worldbrand> We recently had a thread on the sub about bringing back dead memes to trick 2020 into thinking it was a different year
[2:25:37] <eldragon_1> Bad Luck Bryan
[2:25:43] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Minh has surpassed your weak memes
[2:25:43] <+RealThiele> Coffin dance meme is my new fav
[2:25:48] <atyerservice> ^
[2:25:55] <jellssssss20> Have you ever played through the metal gear solid games (3 specifically tbh lol) on stream, any chance that you would?
[2:25:58] <Solidnick18> woah hey now
[2:26:08] <majindusto> WOOLIE, You were Supposed to Support the Lore...Not Deny us It!!!!
[2:26:11] <jellssssss20> He can't show his browser history Minh, chilllllllllllllll

[2:26:12] <Prevot> woolies history is all dark skinned tomboys
[2:26:20] <CorgiRiderCorki> I like the datboi memes OSFrog
[2:26:25] <+jetjagger222> even weeb memes don't age well; haruhi and lucky star are super dead now
[2:26:35] <+RealThiele> woolie hiding his ganguro girl browser window
[2:26:52] <+worldbrand> then ytmnd had its proto-memes that it internally called fads
[2:27:00] <%FuqBoiSlim> I still think coldsteel the hegdeheg is still funny

[2:27:32] <%XxPatchworkxX> Kojima made memes

[2:27:37] <SomersaultJustice> HISTORY OF MEMES
[2:27:40] <Valentinius_Anodyne> In the book Selfish Gene
[2:27:41] <+tearfuldevil> meme, or memetic mutations, has been a thing in the 80s
[2:27:41] <+jiggy_snipe> memes are genes for culture
[2:27:41] <+RealThiele> Genius Kojumbo
[2:27:44] <huskarl_zap> MEME is from antquity

[2:27:47] <anita_dickin> DNA OF THE SOUL
[2:27:47] <%BisoromiBear> the DNA of the ass
[2:27:48] <+worldbrand> memes were just forum image macros at first, but i hadn't heard it used prior to... 2002, i'd say
[2:27:49] <+Itselguapo> Meme is something that is a reference to our culture?
[2:27:50] <Shade075> DNA OF THE SOUL
[2:27:55] <+Itselguapo> if I remember correctly
[2:28:00] <Prevot> the memes jack
[2:28:02] <+jetjagger222> the theme song of pop team epic is literally about memes
[2:28:02] <Lee_The_Limey> THE MEMES , JACK
[2:28:02] <startstoprepeat> meme gained popularity as a term around when people started using impact font in images
[2:28:03] <Pappajimbo> richard dawkins
[2:28:05] <%FuqBoiSlim> Wasnt it Richard Dawkins who coined Memes?
[2:28:06] <Fleet_Admiral_Sakazuki> uptime!
[2:28:11] <JetpackMcQuack> Etymology is complicated
[2:28:11] <Leafboi125> SHOW ME THE MEMES
[2:28:13] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah, it was Dawkins

[2:44:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie too much of a coward to read Lore.

[3:27:37] <%kyh9> Stance switching?
[3:27:45] <Saltmeisterr> @WoolieVersus thats stance switching
[3:27:55] <MyNameIsRasus> WELCOME
[3:28:00] <MyNameIsRasus> TO THE TRUE MAN'S WORLD
[3:28:03] <CorgiRiderCorki> they found stance switch but instantly also found seppuku and now they think that's what it does
[3:28:09] <CorgiRiderCorki> oh nah NVM lol
[3:28:21] <%DSD24> The Moon Prsence

[3:28:42] <MyNameIsRasus> HAYAI
[3:28:42] <%LynbellDaYo> they have missed it entirely
[3:28:49] <Saltmeisterr> @WoolieVersus stance switching changes the angle of ur attack
[3:28:50] <MyNameIsRasus> It is a thing
[3:28:55] <bevyrage> Stance switching changes if your sword comes out from overhead or underhand, which changes if you have an advantage if they're above or below you
[3:28:56] <CorgiRiderCorki> it is stance switch
[3:29:29] <%LynbellDaYo> So what's the point
[3:29:32] <segychan> this level fucking slaps
[3:29:35] <CorgiRiderCorki> ^
[3:29:41] <%Arek_1> Overcut and undercut.
[3:29:43] <%DSD24> Rain makes a lot of things cooler
[3:29:44] <bevyrage> if you swing from overhand someone above you gets hits sooner than if you swung underhand
[3:29:52] <%LynbellDaYo> oh i see, cool
[3:29:53] <bevyrage> underhand hits someone below you faster than overhand
[3:30:00] <CursedNobleman> invisigun is harder LUL
[3:30:04] <Saltmeisterr> @WoolieVersus underhand hits slightly above u and vice versa

[3:48:32] <alephalpha> I just wnat my anime airdashers to stay complex and wild
[3:48:36] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> Maybe SF6 will go back to delay netcode, after all the hate capcom has seen for SFV's netcode Kappa
[3:48:37] <%Arek_1> Proximity normals has to return.
[3:48:42] <bevyrage> unless sf6 does third strike and tries something new, unlike... pushing the same old tired bs

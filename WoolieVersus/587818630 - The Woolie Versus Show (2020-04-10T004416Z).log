[0:03:16] <@Menitta> Menitta subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! I'm using my sub to say that Titanfall 2 is $4.99 on PC through Amazon. Go buy it.
[0:03:59] <am_omega> Yo yo holy shit. its time for the BEST fighting game
[0:04:09] <am_omega> No question its time for the best

[0:04:46] <Sir_Blitz> KOF PogChamp
[0:04:49] <mr_ESB> 02 later too?
[0:04:51] <am_omega> "yo but 13/2002UM" NO
[0:05:02] <am_omega> 98UMFE is the pinacle.
[0:05:03] <@Menitta> I like 02 way more than 98 tho
[0:05:15] <FrostyLionEh> Is it weird that I hate fighting games but love Woolie and Pat’s content?
[0:05:16] <@Menitta> Hell i'd put 11 as my favorite
[0:05:17] <Froyuken> It all began...
[0:05:39] <mr_ESB> But all those characters in 02 um o_o
[0:05:43] <am_omega> Throw those others in the trash. 98 for LIFE
[0:06:00] <am_omega> First off no not all.
[0:06:12] <@Menitta> 98 has no Vanessa
[0:06:19] <@Menitta> clearly subpar. Kappa
[0:06:34] <%Haarute> woolie play goodbye esaka
[0:06:39] <%LordSDB> All you need is Terry
[0:06:48] <PerverseMilk> PerverseMilk subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:06:49] <am_omega> But does 02UM have Heavy D? No, so its trash
[0:06:58] <@Menitta> HEAVY D IS NO VANESSA
[0:06:59] <brunoberserk> ITS ALL BEGIN IN 94
[0:07:09] <%PerverseMilk> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[0:07:14] <am_omega> Also they nerfed Ralf's Galactica Phantom in 02UM.
[0:07:20] <Bob8644> KEPT ON ROLLIN IN 95
[0:07:30] <am_omega> Yeah Heavy D is better than some THOT
[0:07:34] <@Menitta> my team in 98 is lame. I just have Kyo, Terry, and...idk Leona
[0:07:54] <mr_ESB> Whens seth ramon and jhun?
[0:07:59] <brunoberserk> PIECES FELL IN PLACE IN '96
[0:08:15] <am_omega> Plus 02UM covers the worst saga
[0:08:26] <@Menitta> I will say it was WACK of SNK to release KOF97 with online INSTEAD OF 02 OR 98
[0:08:27] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1247403021576876032?s=20
[0:08:35] <Ozavic> >Blud
[0:08:35] <@Menitta> WHY 97
[0:08:46] <californaya> what the hell am I listening to
[0:08:49] <mr_ESB> I love 98 too but 02 a bit more
[0:08:57] <Ozavic> You're listening to [blud]
[0:09:01] <Bob8644> with GOOD online? because 2002UM's online was uh....
[0:09:12] <silver64_> I'm pretty sure this is a triple-q mashup
[0:09:28] <%gatorafan> You can count with a hand the KOFs with good online.
[0:09:29] <@Menitta> I mean, they put KOF98 UM on PS4 but it was the PS2 version
[0:09:31] <@Menitta> Like
[0:09:32] <@Menitta> wtf
[0:09:42] <%gatorafan> As a matter of fact, I'm pretty sure it's just 97.
[0:10:03] <am_omega> Let me give it like this. 98 is solid, a good artwork piece. 02UM is like it trying to capture that glory and not really being the same.
[0:10:05] <@Menitta> I mean in this context, what does "good online" mean
[0:10:12] <@Menitta> if GGPO, technically it's just Garou
[0:10:32] <californaya> man, the worst online I've dealt with lately is fucking Uno
[0:10:37] <Bob8644> that tweet aged like fucking wine
[0:10:38] <californaya> Ubisoft's online is garbage
[0:10:42] <@Menitta> Why you tryin to slam 02? 02 is fuckin good. Leave 02 alone
[0:10:53] <am_omega> Nah 02UM is fine.
[0:11:06] <am_omega> Vanilla 02 is a trash fire though.

[0:15:50] <eddie_hedgehog> whens the valorant code giveaway
[0:15:54] <@Menitta> this is PC I assume

[0:20:44] <nothuzad> p much ye
[0:20:44] <%Irridium> 100%
[0:20:54] <Man_in_the_Red> already got the galaxy version doodDed
[0:20:58] <@Menitta> unpopular opinion, I like the style of the older sprites
[0:21:03] <%Solidnick18> that's a great fight game
[0:21:11] <+Reverend_Roscoe> fuck, too slow
[0:21:20] <MoroseLoki> SeemsGood
[0:21:23] <%Irridium> someone got it
[0:21:29] <Oak_bogle> @menitta I feel that your still valid with that opinion
[0:21:34] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> wait a sec KoF XIII isn't old, it came out in... oh. Fuck. I'm old.
[0:21:35] <Oak_bogle> You’re *
[0:21:41] <%jiggy_snipe> congrats
[0:21:53] <am_omega> Nah I get that, there is something great in the older sprites
[0:21:55] <@Solidus_113> I think you already gave that one away on the first stream I gave you the image LUL
[0:22:02] <powafull> damn I didn't even have the website open lol
[0:22:05] <@Solidus_113> The last on that list was Garou
[0:22:09] <%jiggy_snipe> bummed that KOF14 didn't continue using these sprites
[0:22:39] <+DreyfussFrost> It's annoying more games don't have that, because as far as colors go, it's REALLY easy to allow players to customize sprite color palettes.
[0:22:40] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:22:43] <silver64_> garou
[0:22:44] <@Menitta> fuck yeah Garou
[0:22:55] <TheyCallMeVawn> KoF 13 anatomy always throws me off
[0:22:59] <GeltonZ> @jiggy_snipe Agreed but...also understandable. Those sprites DID bankrupt SNK *AGAIN*.
[0:22:59] <Ranger747> I made a Lakers Yuri once
[0:23:12] <%Solidnick18> get them worves
[0:23:15] <+Reverend_Roscoe> GOT IT
[0:23:21] <@Solidus_113> Wild Wolf Terry
[0:23:21] <nothuzad> but what about HnK? SeriousSloth
[0:23:23] <@Menitta> It is criminal that Terry never got the Garou costume in Smash
[0:23:27] <%Irridium> damn
[0:23:30] <%SirGO0SE> Clap
[0:23:53] <+Reverend_Roscoe> THANKS WOOLIE
[0:23:58] <silver64_> @Menitta I was kinda expecting him to have it too
[0:24:00] <+MisterRaffles> Woolie, any love for the American Sports Team?
[0:24:07] <+uzumakiherogame> uzumakiherogame subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:24:37] <plushysceptile> As a full blooded Mexican SNK player, I hereby bestow permission to play KoF and the knowledge of holding start/select for EX characters on the select screen
[0:24:41] <am_omega> Oh no rumors, Terry and Blue Mary be FUCKIN. In full caps
[0:24:58] <powafull> Heavy-D fucks

[0:25:12] <am_omega> YE YE
[0:25:14] <tolloponik> New face Team Lets go
[0:25:18] <2deep5u> I love how "buster" is used so often in Engrish because it's so cool a word in terms of sheer sound
[0:25:19] <+ikasukiz> heavy D's heavy D
[0:25:21] <@Menitta> IT ALL BEGAN IN 94
[0:25:23] <%Solidnick18> SourPls
[0:25:24] <@Solidus_113> SourPls
[0:25:26] <+vaporousTippler> So weird to see Playmore's name on this one.
[0:25:29] <+ikasukiz> SourPls
[0:25:33] <powafull> SourPls
[0:25:35] <am_omega> SNK are cowards for not bringing them back.
[0:25:38] <+MisterRaffles> I do love the faster tempo of the theme
[0:25:39] <@Menitta> woolieGASM
[0:25:50] <am_omega> Kreygasm
[0:25:54] <%SirGO0SE> man i never imagined that during the kotor 2 LP, with fuckin' Half Life going on, that the channels most popular series would be dokapon by a country mile
[0:26:10] <brunoberserk> Woolie ,a tip for you ,some characters have alternate version with different moveset, some of them is super broken like omega rugal and the orochis , hold start to pick the alternate version
[0:26:21] <mistersups> !time
[0:26:25] <Froyuken> Don't think I've heard that version of the opening before.
[0:26:28] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> ^gotta give'em those boss character tips
[0:26:30] <+ikasukiz> someone else already told him thay
[0:27:14] <am_omega> Yo fucking assists.
[0:27:30] <am_omega> The first one with assists.
[0:27:33] <+ikasukiz> diet assists
[0:27:49] <am_omega> Paving the way
[0:28:20] <brunoberserk> assists in this game are situational and pratically useless
[0:28:31] <am_omega> Still though.
[0:28:42] <RacistWakka> who lost the most?
[0:28:47] <+ikasukiz> meanwhile the real first game with assist was probably one of the capcom tag fighters
[0:29:11] <$legacy0117> Sometimes, application of imagination into a simplistic story can be the most entertaining stuff ever. Like AI Dungeon, it's just text, until you make it into something amazing.
[0:30:45] <%uzumakiherogame> Wow, I also never knew that wtf
[0:30:45] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule

[0:43:37] <@Menitta> the best stage is the garden one in KOF99
[0:43:46] <MrJazzbo> which platform are they playing on?
[0:43:58] <%Solidnick18> it knocks them down lol
[0:44:01] <@Menitta> PC
[0:44:03] <am_omega> Steam unless its on GOG.
[0:44:09] <+PJSmooth> If you go over to the other side of the screen Kyo and Benimaru jump the ground slam
[0:44:30] <brunoberserk> daimon is a nightmare in this game
[0:44:36] <artificiallynatural> I love that the background characters react to what happens

[0:47:02] <+vaporousTippler> All that meter.
[0:47:06] <@Menitta> 2002

[0:49:12] <TheGershon> I've seen way too many... 'animations' with Brian
[0:49:15] <Sir_Blitz> But Woolie they're not social distancing doing this either 😠
[0:49:31] <@Menitta> Brian Battler is an XFL player

[0:51:32] <%jiggy_snipe> Blue Mary Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[0:51:32] <$legacy0117> Too much poking. x3
[0:51:33] <MattDemers> @MrJazzbo Gotta say Cammy for the leotard, but it's a close race.
[0:51:40] <%Jetzord> Blue Mary
[0:51:46] <%jetjagger222> LA lakers
[0:51:52] <%zeroarturia> Blue Mary
[0:51:52] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:51:53] <powafull> Ballin'!
[0:51:55] <+vaporousTippler> Blue Mary would be a lot more fun, in general.
[0:52:01] <MattDemers> Fuckin' lakers colors
[0:52:02] <%zeroarturia> doodLewd doodLewd
[0:52:02] <+vaporousTippler> Cammy's already a weird cat lady.
[0:52:06] <MattDemers> @vaporousTippler Agreed.
[0:52:07] <MomsForseti> GUESS BALL BABY
[0:52:14] <$legacy0117> Micheal Jordan???
[0:52:22] <+vaporousTippler> Like, can you picture Cammy in a bar? Mary would run that place.
[0:52:33] <%Jetzord> We need a mod for Lucky to have a "Kobe" Voice line
[0:52:34] <MrJazzbo> hellbound
[0:52:35] <$legacy0117> That's a heck of a cameo.
[0:52:36] <MayorRev> CHAOS DUNK
[0:52:37] <Froyuken> Ball is life.
[0:53:02] <am_omega> Again the American Sports team is criminally not used in the series.
[0:53:03] <%jetjagger222> oh god choi
[0:53:10] <artificiallynatural> PAPA HEIDERN
[0:53:14] <am_omega> Solid characters.
[0:53:20] <+PJSmooth> Masters team is just too cool
[0:53:24] <Froyuken> Team boomer.

[0:53:53] <APB_Harleqyn> I LOVE the news network menu presentation and transitions!
[0:53:57] <%zeroarturia> The Oyaji team
[0:53:59] <MattDemers> I love how Change is eating in the background
[0:54:07] <MattDemers> The other dads have the same pose
[0:54:16] <%jetjagger222> heidern is basically big boss
[0:54:22] <KatyParry_FGC> ^
[0:54:23] <FlamingNarwhal> its the universal "i am a dad" pose
[0:54:27] <MattDemers> UUUUUU
[0:54:27] <Sir_Blitz> OOOOOO
[0:54:32] <Froyuken> Team loose sleeves in the back.
[0:54:40] <KatyParry_FGC> big AF boss
[0:54:46] <KatyParry_FGC> heidern like 9 foot 12
[0:54:48] <+heyitsdenzel_> lets not animate the chain
[0:54:48] <brunoberserk> don't talk with choi players
[0:54:59] <MrJazzbo> i like Kim FailFish every time chang gets hit
[0:55:00] <$legacy0117> Tall dude is crazy fast.
[0:55:01] <%winds_0f_change> They're B
[0:55:09] <KatyParry_FGC> chang is so charming
[0:55:14] <%jetjagger222> choi's dead
[0:55:18] <+nekodelic> Chang is cool and all, but loli Chang is the superior version
[0:55:28] <MattDemers> Kim best boy
[0:55:29] <KatyParry_FGC> Chibi Chang*
[0:55:45] <MrJazzbo> anyone in here play KOF All Star
[0:55:46] <%winds_0f_change> They're B.A.D dads
[0:55:52] <Froyuken> Kim's gonna rehabilitate team daddies.
[0:55:54] <+R_BChe> loli chang in kof all star mobile game is wild lol
[0:55:59] <FlamingNarwhal> Big man with big weapon is cool small child with big weapon bigger than their body is always cooler
[0:56:02] <silver64_> Heidern reminds me of Golan from FothNS
[0:56:10] <+MisterRaffles> Do you prefer Chang and Choi in the TKD attire or their own get up?
[0:56:16] <%jetjagger222> @silver64_ him and brocken from kinnikuman
[0:56:34] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[0:56:37] <fangovafang> Oh shit King of Fighters 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
[0:56:41] <+StooEsq> walking into a meatgrinder
[0:56:46] <%jiggy_snipe> vacuum fist
[0:56:47] <+KinnikuDash> PogChamp
[0:56:47] <%jetjagger222> fun fact: takuma (as mr. karate) is the one from KOF able to keep up with akuma
[0:56:54] <Fujiwara_92> takuma too stronk
[0:57:02] <+KinnikuDash> I chose the right time to tune in
[0:57:02] <+MisterRaffles> I love the playstyle of Takuma, just wish he kept the Mask
[0:57:05] <MattDemers> YOU'RE AN DISGRACE
[0:57:07] <MrJazzbo> don't let Takuma catch you making a pass at his daughter
[0:57:07] <TheArrow_> jesus that fireball's got some speed
[0:57:08] <Sir_Blitz> YOU'RE AN DISGRACE
[0:57:10] <$legacy0117> Is there a Sagat in this? He would be stupidly tall.
[0:57:20] <+MisterRaffles> The mask adds so much to his design
[0:57:23] <+vaporousTippler> Takuma's EX mode should put the mask on.
[0:57:23] <silver64_> @jetjagger222 Ooh, you're right
[0:57:25] <KatyParry_FGC> no sagat but there is a joe
[0:57:36] <+PJSmooth> The boss team
[0:57:36] <$legacy0117> Cool.
[0:57:37] <KatyParry_FGC> hey there he go
[0:57:39] <%Solidnick18> shermie PogChamp
[0:57:44] <am_omega> Krouser is kinda big
[0:57:54] <FlamingNarwhal> has King been played yet chat?
[0:57:55] <%jetjagger222> DIES IRAE
[0:58:03] <KatyParry_FGC> KOF sagats are ryu height
[0:58:03] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[0:58:03] <MrJazzbo> Joe's a muay thai practitioner like Sagat
[0:58:09] <+PJSmooth> The Fatal Fury 2 reference
[0:58:10] <%Solidnick18> I love you krauser
[0:58:15] <+KinnikuDash> I love that re-used clip from Fatal Fury 2
[0:58:15] <KatyParry_FGC> sagat & hwa jai
[0:58:16] <$legacy0117> Exactly.
[0:58:19] <Froyuken> Was he in the OG '98?
[0:58:22] <KatyParry_FGC> LETS GO ANDY
[0:58:22] <brunoberserk> ex geese is better than normal geese
[0:58:26] <+vaporousTippler> This canon-ass fight.
[0:58:26] <KatyParry_FGC> hayabu2Andy hayabu2Andy hayabu2Andy
[0:58:27] <artificiallynatural> damn what a sick ass theme
[0:58:31] <+jetjagger222> BLEETZBOL
[0:58:32] <am_omega> No he was not in OG 98.
[0:58:33] <MattDemers> I've always wanted to like Andy more than Terry, but he doesn't exactly give us a lot to work with
[0:58:37] <Klefth> Is that... BLEETZ BOL?
[0:58:45] <Froyuken> Andy "Super Celibate" Bogard.
[0:58:47] <KatyParry_FGC> @MattDemers Bad writing
[0:58:49] <+PJSmooth> The entire boss team was excluded from vanilla 98
[0:58:53] <KatyParry_FGC> The Better Bogard
[0:58:53] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1247403021576876032?s=20
[0:58:59] <KatyParry_FGC> hayabu2Andy hayabu2Andy
[0:59:03] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[0:59:08] <%Jetzord> Jesus, Murderhawk Krauser
[0:59:13] <Fujiwara_92> Andy "Never Mai, never" Bogard
[0:59:17] <+cheezy_snackz> Andy sucks don't @ me
[0:59:18] <$legacy0117> Nice gameplayyy.
[0:59:20] <Froyuken> Surprised at how good Wolfgang's English is.
[0:59:26] <brunoberserk> do a kaiser wave
[0:59:26] <KatyParry_FGC> @ him now
[0:59:36] <Fujiwara_92> LUL
[0:59:36] <artificiallynatural> You'd think Terry's ninja brother would be more interesting a character but apparently not
[0:59:45] <KatyParry_FGC> bad. writing.
[0:59:48] <+PJSmooth> Krauser was actually voiced by an english speaking person
[1:00:07] <am_omega> You know if I ever become a pro fighter I would want a orchestra to play Deis Irae in the backround.
[1:00:10] <CasualAlohaFriday> But he's supposed to be German
[1:00:14] <@Menitta> he's a big guy
[1:00:19] <FlamingNarwhal> for YOU
[1:00:20] <%Jetzord> Man, I gotta ask my muay thai instructor when we're going to learn how to throw tornadoes
[1:00:29] <%generalve> how come no one cares for KOF 99 ?
[1:00:34] <fruit_pie_the_magician> SPICY KICK
[1:00:44] <Sgww> if i take that mask off will you die?
[1:00:45] <CasualAlohaFriday> BJ Love was Krauser's VA, same as Franco's
[1:00:45] <Fujiwara_92> we care, it's just that 98 is better
[1:00:45] <MattDemers> GEESU
[1:00:47] <+vaporousTippler> 99 added a lot of questionable shit.
[1:00:57] <silver64_> @Jetzord It's after you learn the Tiger Uppercut
[1:01:04] <@Menitta> I respect 99 for having THE BEST stages
[1:01:11] <$legacy0117> A Zangeif with a staff? Huh.
[1:01:14] <KatyParry_FGC> throwing tornadoes comes with the hand wraps
[1:01:23] <+KinnikuDash> I thought the music changes with the characters in 98UM, unless the Steam version is different?
[1:01:25] <+vaporousTippler> I love Krizalid's stages and their themes. That first round is sick.
[1:01:27] <%jetjagger222> this aint SF
[1:01:30] <FlamingNarwhal> is it weird that I like Geese with the shirt more than shirtless Geese?
[1:01:37] <KatyParry_FGC> hayabu2Andy
[1:01:42] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> leave it to woolie to play a boss character like Joe
[1:01:43] <%Solidnick18> lol
[1:01:44] <Klefth> Bruh
[1:01:49] <+StooEsq> ?????
[1:01:56] <+bladeofSorensen> @KatyParry_FGC jbxHello
[1:01:58] <Klefth> You don't know what you messin' with, child
[1:02:06] <@Menitta> THE RUGAL IS FRUGAL
[1:02:08] <KatyParry_FGC> @bladeofSorensen VoHiYo
[1:02:08] <Fujiwara_92> did they play leona?
[1:02:10] <MrJazzbo> Orochi team PogChamp
[1:02:10] <powafull> That means there's a Christ of Martial Arts
[1:02:10] <Froyuken> KOKO DESU KA?
[1:02:11] <$legacy0117> I know isn't. I'm just enjoying the different fighting styles.
[1:02:17] <brunoberserk> pick omega rugal
[1:02:17] <am_omega> Wrong Rugal.
[1:02:20] <FlamingNarwhal> @powafull yeah its Christ
[1:02:23] <artificiallynatural> yeah Ikari warrior team was already played
[1:02:23] <MattDemers> No Maxima for the Canada factor :(
[1:02:24] <%jiggy_snipe> @FlamingNarwhal he looks much coolr with his shirt
[1:02:29] <+PJSmooth> CYS in the house
[1:02:31] <Fujiwara_92> THE FRUGAL IS RUGAL
[1:02:32] <am_omega> Omega Rugal is the problem one.
[1:02:32] <Korgororo> SHERMIE Kreygasm
[1:02:36] <+l4dy_luck> I am told Rugal is actually bad in this
[1:02:48] <Froyuken> What's Shemie's deal in the series?
[1:02:57] <CasualAlohaFriday> There's base Rugal and Omega Rugal in this game, iirc
[1:02:59] <FlamingNarwhal> @jiggy_snipe I definitely think the shirt is a lot more stylish
[1:03:01] <MattDemers> Mai just jammin' in the background
[1:03:09] <Korgororo> she's a follower of orochi
[1:03:10] <@Menitta> GENOCIDE CUTTAH
[1:03:11] <Zarkusto> the new faces team joined the Kof tournament because they hated iori
[1:03:11] <KatyParry_FGC> shermie and the gang are all descendants of a god. they're also in a band
[1:03:16] <Klefth> This version has the best Rugal voice
[1:03:17] <TheGershon> There's something about sleeveless black tops that are just the best clothing
[1:03:18] <CasualAlohaFriday> Omega Rugal is the boss version, and he's pretty bullshit
[1:03:19] <@Solidus_113> CUTTAH
[1:03:23] <rcgama> he reminds me of Akihiko a bit
[1:03:29] <MattDemers> HYDRATE
[1:03:29] <Fujiwara_92> yashiro is basically grapple akihiko
[1:03:29] <am_omega> Yo you gotta hold select for Omega Rugal.
[1:03:31] <$legacy0117> Oh snap.
[1:03:32] <@Menitta> I'm a big fan of Suit Rugal
[1:03:39] <+StooEsq> drink water
[1:03:44] <Oak_bogle> Man this crunch is so satisfying
[1:03:44] <+KinnikuDash> @froyuken Pretty much the same as Chris and Yashiro. Band Mates and Orochi followers, in '97 they kill themselves to revive Orochi.
[1:03:47] <Korgororo> PogChamp
[1:03:53] <zard9> Castlevania run in?!
[1:04:07] <Klefth> God, SNK really were the fucking masters of 2D stages
[1:04:09] <%jetjagger222> @zard9 on point
[1:04:14] <Fujiwara_92> Rugal is pretty much Dracula
[1:04:23] <KatyParry_FGC> this is my favorite stage in the series
[1:04:25] <Fujiwara_92> Shermie Kreygasm
[1:04:26] <gaberome88> psaWrong
[1:04:30] <@Menitta> daily reminder to look at that amazing imgur album of fighting game stages as gifs
[1:04:35] <@Solidus_113> A should win

[1:05:21] <KatyParry_FGC> yung justin bieber
[1:05:24] <+TomDanksEGOT> Man I wish SNK kept up with the 2d sprites instead of going 3d.
[1:05:31] <KatyParry_FGC> 3d less expensive

[1:05:55] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:06:02] <am_omega> 13 bankrupted SNK AGAIN.
[1:06:03] <Froyuken> @TomDanksEGOT If they did that, they'd only put out a KoF every 3 to 5 years.
[1:06:05] <TheArrow_> 13 was beautiful. still is

[1:06:35] <@Menitta> I mean they are putting out a kof every 3-5 years now lol
[1:06:40] <KatyParry_FGC> speaking of 13. ppl should be looking out for SNK sales on PC. they happen quite often
[1:06:41] <+PJSmooth> Chris and his moonwalk
[1:06:42] <+TomDanksEGOT> Yeah i know its just a shame because there's so much love and detail in these games that just feels absent in the current ones
[1:06:57] <Froyuken> @Menitta You're not wrong. lol
[1:07:04] <BlackOrchidKI> the shota wins
[1:07:10] <@Menitta> Idk I think if Samsho is anything to go by, XV should be amazing, visually

[1:07:18] <brunoberserk> now pick the orochi versions
[1:07:23] <+vaporousTippler> It's funny how KOF skipped right from 11 to 13. Never seen a game do that.

[1:07:59] <Malik1002> ?
[1:08:00] <@Solidus_113> neat
[1:08:17] <Alseid> No he doesn't!
[1:08:22] <CasualAlohaFriday> Wait, really? I don't remember that.

[1:08:29] <Fujiwara_92> @heyitsdenzel_ I knew I loved that both for a reason beside tits. .. nice
[1:08:36] <KatyParry_FGC> London March <3
[1:08:40] <Fujiwara_92> *them both
[1:08:43] <+PJSmooth> This is the only game I've seen Eiji to the air kunai throw
[1:08:44] <CasualAlohaFriday> He's descended from that ninja from Last Blade, and he despises the Sakazaki family
[1:08:45] <Froyuken> That Nolkswagon in the back.
[1:08:45] <%jetjagger222> @woolieVS he's the descendant of zantetsu from last blade
[1:08:50] <brunoberserk> wrong , duolon clan is a chinese clan , they basically lin kuei
[1:08:52] <+heyitsdenzel_> duck king and todoh in background
[1:09:12] <+PJSmooth> They even gave Eiji Zantetsu's super in XI
[1:09:14] <Froyuken> @heyitsdenzel_ They're invitation got lost in the mail.
[1:09:15] <Alseid> Yeah, he's a descendant of that Last Blade ninja, but he's not related to the Hizoku, Lin/Duolon's clan
[1:09:15] <BlackOrchidKI> Look at Orochi sticking out like a sore thumb
[1:09:21] <+cheezy_snackz> whos shingo
[1:09:32] <KatyParry_FGC> shingo is kyo's sakura
[1:09:33] <%jetjagger222> @cheezy_snackz guy SNK sakura
[1:09:40] <+cheezy_snackz> oh
[1:09:41] <+KinnikuDash> @cheezy_snackz Imagine Dan and Sakura from Street Fighter combined
[1:09:43] <+vaporousTippler> Except Shingo kinda hits like a truck, weirdly.
[1:09:46] <am_omega> Shingo is Kyo's fanboy who is actually decent in a fight.
[1:09:52] <Froyuken> @cheezy_snackz Pretty accurate.
[1:09:52] <%Solidnick18> go shingo
[1:09:55] <%jetjagger222> and reads a guidebook in the middle of fights
[1:10:08] <+vaporousTippler> I don't think there's a fighting game character who tries even half as hard as Shingo.
[1:10:11] <+bladeofSorensen> @KatyParry_FGC I wish this game had the code mystics rollback treatment. :(
[1:10:22] <silver64_> Yuri Yorigami
[1:10:24] <Froyuken> Who's the Dan of KoF?
[1:10:30] <KatyParry_FGC> @bladeofSorensen dont give up hope
[1:10:32] <+KinnikuDash> Shingo
[1:10:35] <brunoberserk> shingo >>>> dan
[1:10:35] <KatyParry_FGC> dan i s2 ppl in KOF
[1:10:35] <BlackOrchidKI> Shingo @Froyuken
[1:10:47] <MoroseLoki> Lol Shingos Dan?
[1:10:50] <+KinnikuDash> Yuri is more Sakura, and even then
[1:10:53] <KatyParry_FGC> Dan is a joke character made from Ryu ans Robert in KOF
[1:10:54] <FlamingNarwhal> what a HERO
[1:10:56] <+bladeofSorensen> @KatyParry_FGC Facts. Whats your favorite version of Andy?
[1:10:58] <KatyParry_FGC> dan is not shingo
[1:10:59] <+vaporousTippler> You can argue Dan is three people. He has Yuri's winpose, afterall.
[1:10:59] <am_omega> Fun fact, Shingo held out fighting a Orochi Iori for a while.
[1:11:03] <+rytyoung> Hey gang!
[1:11:09] <am_omega> Solo too.
[1:11:16] <KatyParry_FGC> dan is ryo & robert with a pathetic personality
[1:11:27] <KatyParry_FGC> @bladeofSorensen 13 Andy is my favorite
[1:11:36] <+vaporousTippler> Shingo's out here collecting teeth.

[1:29:53] <am_omega> Yuri feeds off the souls of SNK characters that will never come back.
[1:29:54] <%jetjagger222> 13 with the "problematic" stage backgrounds

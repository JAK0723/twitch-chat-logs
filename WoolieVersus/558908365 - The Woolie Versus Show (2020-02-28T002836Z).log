[0:07:11] <%Solidnick18> SourPls
[0:07:11] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:07:21] <%Solidnick18> Yeeee
[0:07:22] <Crumptain> Also Helix is the best
[0:07:32] <%Irridium> min min for the win win
[0:07:34] <cyrusvgz> Funny way to spell Twintelle
[0:07:35] <%tearknack> thanks, @DensityD
[0:07:37] <%CaptainPileDriver> the one fighting game i always wanted but never got
[0:07:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> plus i no longer have any room on my switch for even updates.
[0:07:51] <premmylive> ARMS BABY
[0:07:51] <%Wool> lmao trying to get matched up with Woolie in this is gonna SUCK
[0:08:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> why's that?
[0:08:04] <thunderhog> God I'd get on, but my joycon is driftin now
[0:08:16] <%Wool> there's no lobby system without added friends
[0:08:17] <%Irridium> game has no proper lobby you can make. all random
[0:08:19] <%Wool> it's all random matchmaking
[0:08:24] <%Solidnick18> Twintelle Kreygasm
[0:08:30] <YakumoYomi> I hope Nintendo gives it a sequel. I feel it didn't get a fair shot because it released too close to Splatoon 2 (which had a similar aesthetic and beginner friendliness)
[0:08:31] <%Irridium> because Nintendo
[0:08:40] <Crumptain> @cyrusvgz Too many people like Twintelle, no breathing room anymore
[0:08:40] <cyrusvgz> My pro controller got water damaged so I'm back to using Joycons. I hope they don't start drifting.
[0:08:41] <thunderhog> @Wool Pretty sure you can do rooms i swear
[0:08:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> wow, that sucks @Wool
[0:08:48] <thunderhog> Oh wait
[0:08:51] <thunderhog> Only if you do friends
[0:08:58] <Crumptain> The blobbula is where it's at
[0:09:03] <thunderhog> I forgot theres no public rooms. jesus
[0:09:20] <+IncredibleMeh> Yeah lobby system is...charming but horribly limited
[0:09:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> we haven't played pokken yet on gifg yet have we?
[0:09:39] <%Irridium> @YakumoYomi I mean the game still did really well, sold like 2 million when all was said and done
[0:09:43] <Crumptain> I remember taking part in an online tourney for this game and having the TO personally thank me in DMS for knocking out a guy that was holding up the tournament
[0:09:52] <+astroninja0> Lobby system kinda eh tbh. Could be a lot better
[0:09:54] <Crumptain> never had that before or since
[0:10:01] <cyrusvgz> Pokken is amazing. I want to buy it one of these days.
[0:10:02] <+astroninja0> btw im the top player in NA currently
[0:10:05] <%generalve> 8 mins woolie >:(
[0:10:13] <%generalve> woolieCHAN woolieCHAN woolieCHAN
[0:10:13] <%Wool> top player in a game no one plays :^)
[0:10:26] <Crumptain> How's the meta for ARMS nowadays
[0:10:26] <+astroninja0> Pretty much LOL
[0:10:34] <@Menitta> smh. Arms. not pokken
[0:10:37] <%RVMSpeedWagon> For fun or for glory today?
[0:10:37] <%CaptainPileDriver> sweet, can't wait for pokken fighter
[0:10:39] <Mahbonk> This game deserved better BibleThump
[0:10:39] <Crumptain> has it changed much since 2017/2018?
[0:10:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Menitta wish it was, pokken is the best
[0:10:57] <@Menitta> Jk Arms is real fun
[0:10:58] <+astroninja0> It's hard to tell cause of how limited the playerbase is atm, but it's pretty varied with gloves taking up a lot of the competitive space
[0:11:01] <cyrusvgz> Got my eshop open and waiting Kappa
[0:11:15] <%CaptainPileDriver> pokken forever because garchomp is the best boy
[0:11:22] <@Menitta> I'm pushing for Pokken next week because I'll be able to play online next week
[0:11:27] <Crumptain> ARMS is good Splatoon
[0:11:28] <thunderhog> Yeah I remember ice gloves and stun gloves being good
[0:11:32] <@Menitta> I'm a pikachu boi
[0:11:40] <Crumptain> Do not @ me on that opinion
[0:11:46] <thunderhog> Also I just realised. Woolies not gonna have all arms unlocked, so they have to play characters as is
[0:11:46] <%Solidnick18> will he do dbfz?
[0:11:51] <+astroninja0> Wait there's no such thing as a stun glove.
[0:12:01] <YakumoYomi> I put a lot of hours into Gardevoir on the Wii U version of Pokken
[0:12:02] <+astroninja0> The weapons they use in the game are called ARMs not gloves
[0:12:02] <+IncredibleMeh> The game has a tournament mode so they should be good
[0:12:03] <Crumptain> I think he means the Electric gloves
[0:12:06] <+astroninja0> Gloves are a type of ARM
[0:12:07] <thunderhog> Was there not one? didnt ribbon have elec gloves?
[0:12:17] <thunderhog> It's been years
[0:12:18] <%generalve> wooliePOYO wooliePOYO wooliePOYO wooliePOYO wooliePOYO wooliePOYO
[0:12:28] <Crumptain> Ribbon had elec, yeah
[0:12:29] <+astroninja0> Electric ye, stun is it's own thing
[0:12:31] <%Solidnick18> wooliePOYO woolieWHENS
[0:12:32] <allmightythunder> I think there is a thing to have em all unlocked for tournaments and stuff
[0:12:54] <+astroninja0> Ye tournament mode
[0:12:56] <thunderhog> I just played vanilla minmin the whole time either way
[0:13:03] <Crumptain> we need to send woolie the tournament mode code for this
[0:13:18] <+astroninja0> It's R3 + L & R
[0:13:29] <thunderhog> Are you allowed to go online with that?
[0:13:35] <Crumptain> nah
[0:13:37] <%Wool> everyone join the CSB Discord
[0:13:46] <Crumptain> but it makes doing locals good
[0:13:50] <thunderhog> Ah, well i guess if they're doing local battles that's fine
[0:13:58] <@Menitta> Min Min is one of my favorite new Nintendo designs
[0:14:00] <+astroninja0> You can go online but only in friend lobbies
[0:14:00] <Crumptain> wish DBFZ had it tbh
[0:14:02] <@Menitta> she's so cool
[0:14:07] <Mahbonk> Min Min is so cute
[0:14:11] <%Wool> I'd fuck her
[0:14:19] <+astroninja0> Min Min's kinda ugly tbh.
[0:14:19] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1232714491890208768
[0:14:20] <thunderhog> Damn ok
[0:14:27] <Crumptain> DBFZ could really use a mode like that for A21 and the Blue Goku and Vegeta
[0:14:29] <@Menitta> and yeah join the discord on the reddit. I hear its okay.
[0:14:36] <thunderhog> Min's my girl doh. Liked her big dragon lazer
[0:14:55] <EndgameContent> DID SOMEBODY SAY A R M S

[0:15:44] <+kraajkase> FEAR
[0:15:45] <Crumptain> ARMS is cancelled, Woolie announces Splatoon 3, exclusively on stream
[0:15:46] <%generalve> is the stream supossed to start at 8 pm or is he super late ?
[0:15:51] <%Solidnick18> @CaptainPileDriver he last did dbfz 12 months ago so yeah see what's happen
[0:16:01] <%Wool> him being a few minutes late is normal
[0:16:16] <%generalve> maybe it justs just hard because nintendo switch is are to record ?
[0:16:35] <%generalve> KIL KIL KILLERRRR
[0:16:41] <%generalve> KILLERRR
[0:16:53] <%generalve> THA MIND

[0:17:17] <%generalve> gear is the mind killer
[0:17:22] <%generalve> *fear
[0:17:25] <Lewisisphat> Kreygasm
[0:17:50] <%generalve> Its basicly why Rez was worth 50 $ back then
[0:18:06] <%tearknack> okay i'm guessing that this is not "fear is the mind killer" from the Dune movie OST
[0:18:10] <%tearknack> ah, Rez, duh
[0:18:10] <+smacksfenton> anyone know if woolie is going to check out season 3 of dbfz soon?
[0:18:14] <%Wool> I'm sorry to all the actual ARMS players that I'm about to dodge to try and fight Woolie and friends
[0:18:24] <@Menitta> wool you coward
[0:18:31] <rustedfish> time for a daily dose of woolie, symptoms may occur
[0:18:37] <%tearknack> is there any penalties for quitting matches in ARMS
[0:18:38] <+IncredibleMeh> You had BETTER dodge me
[0:18:41] <%Solidnick18> so how in depth is arms?
[0:18:53] <LiteraryFirearms> ARMS O:
[0:19:08] <TungstenViper> the surpises
[0:19:23] <+astroninja0> Pretty shallow tbh, it has a lot of ARMS you can pick from but it's incredibly simple

[0:26:11] <LiteraryFirearms> ARMS is a really creative take on 3D fighters. It definitely could've used more attention ^^

[0:27:33] <Dragon_Batman> Yoo, Arms was super dope
[0:27:38] <LiteraryFirearms> Yeah, ARMS has that classic vibe of easy to learn, hard to master. Approachable controls but more complex than it first appears.
[0:27:38] <%Solidnick18> discover the tech
[0:27:44] <+IncredibleMeh> Of which I was also one of only three Springtron mains in existence
[0:27:45] <+Metaternal> Sweet I'm just in time for Helix

[0:33:44] <dapperskeleton69> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[0:33:50] <DontChuckle98> You might need to attach the joycons to the controller grip attachment.
[0:33:50] <featherlan> Man, back when I was in the Navy, this was my GAAAAME
[0:34:02] <Dragon_Batman> I guess it just forces that setting when it detects joy cons at all?
[0:34:15] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Oh no, hot clown waifu
[0:34:19] <LiteraryFirearms> You can play with the grip, they just need to be settled into it properly

[0:46:19] <LiteraryFirearms> Misango's the Shulk of this game, with red for armor, blue for speed, and yellow for super
[0:46:22] <+astroninja0> Misango's basically Alolan Shulk
[0:46:28] <gamemastertom> also, blocking with Misango turns the spirit into a pillar that blocks attacks, and touching the pillar gives you a mask
[0:46:32] <+NWR_James> this stage is savage in more than 1v1
[0:46:36] <NeroInfinite> and he's poisoned too
[0:46:37] <thunderhog> also his base arms are ass
[0:46:53] <+astroninja0> Skully and Glusher are OD wym
[0:46:57] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> We got the deets in chat PogChamp
[0:47:05] <+astroninja0> It's Scorpio that's the weird one
[0:47:12] <+Dr_DangerPhD> this stage in 1v1v1 is a salt factory, 1 person is immediately getting double teamed lol
[0:47:22] <featherlan> Coyle's default ARMS are ridiculous
[0:47:28] <TheDrown> Air scorpion is better than ground imo
[0:47:31] <+SnapIntoaTimJim> I want a megalobox character. No ARMS just boxing.
[0:47:41] <Mahbonk> OMG JC
[0:47:46] <%DensityD> a bomb
[0:47:47] <+rooked4> What timeline did I stumble into>
[0:47:56] <%DensityD> woolieGLORY
[0:47:57] <thunderhog> Back away from the meter zone
[0:47:58] <%Irridium> that gives you super LUL
[0:48:11] <Mahbonk> No it's protein . Eez good for you
[0:48:14] <+NWR_James> Power Up Backdowns
[0:48:17] <powerprotoman> reggie picked the boss character
[0:48:19] <%Solidnick18> good job
[0:48:24] <thunderhog> @WoolieVersus Also you can expand the range of the throw if you spread the arms out, but you make it easier to break
[0:48:25] <%Irridium> yellow circles generate super for everyone in them, green generates health
[0:48:27] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> COYLE Kreygasm
[0:48:40] <blackkanye> I was gone. What is his mechanic?
[0:48:42] <Mahbonk> God she's cool and edgy
[0:48:44] <%DensityD> GOO DNA Kreygasm
[0:48:47] <%tearknack> well i know what i'm looking up when this stream ends
[0:48:47] <+astroninja0> Captain Almight looking dude
[0:48:48] <featherlan> Who
[0:48:49] <gamemastertom> the 4 ítems in battles are: fire bomb, shock bomb, health juice and rush juice
[0:48:52] <NeroInfinite> The little buddy can betray you if you let the opponent get the drops.
[0:48:56] <Gutsandlove> maximillian on da house
[0:48:57] <%Solidnick18> Yeeyee doggo
[0:49:23] <+Dr_DangerPhD> byte and barq has some interesting stuff you can set up, tricky to play against
[0:49:29] <Dapper_Cactuar> Brass is a boss character
[0:49:29] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:49:39] <LiteraryFirearms> !twitter
[0:49:39] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:49:40] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Awww the robit dog is so cute LUL
[0:49:43] <Mahbonk> pupper
[0:49:46] <%DensityD> we Astral Chain now?
[0:49:50] <dapperskeleton69> PUPPER SNUFFER
[0:49:54] <%Solidnick18> come on doggo
[0:50:17] <gamemastertom> fun fact, byte and barq cheated their way into the ARMS grand Prix by pretending to be one carácter (barq turns into the head during rushes)
[0:50:29] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> LUL
[0:50:32] <+IncredibleMeh> No no not jumping is GOOD
[0:50:32] <%DensityD> don't jump LUL
[0:50:47] <LiteraryFirearms> comeback king
[0:50:51] <NeroInfinite> BOP
[0:50:54] <LiteraryFirearms> as we say in the ARMS community, never say gg to a max brass
[0:51:03] <+astroninja0> Also make sure to use Grab with Brass, he has the best grab in the game
[0:51:14] <TheDrown> The arms you guys have also explode when fully charged and you get hit. So for Barq it'll stun him if gets interrupted
[0:51:31] <thunderhog> So yeah, the thing with Max Brass is he gets X factor for free at low HP
[0:51:35] <%DensityD> YOU PUNCHED A DOG
[0:51:46] <%DensityD> dog punches you
[0:51:55] <Dragon_Batman> Free X factor is nuts
[0:52:04] <gamemastertom> btw, all characters have 1000HP
[0:52:23] <@Menitta> I wish Little Mac was in this
[0:52:24] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> I couldn't tell on the HP at first, I thought Max Brass had a shit ton for a second there lol
[0:52:44] <gamemastertom> Max gets super armor when at 25% HP left
[0:52:46] <%Irridium> that's the dash into charge
[0:52:47] <%DensityD> big = slow
[0:52:51] <+IncredibleMeh> OH GOD
[0:53:15] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Reggie's pullin out the giant torpedo arms
[0:53:25] <%DensityD> yes, that was heals
[0:53:26] <LiteraryFirearms> The health bottle makes a healing zone!
[0:53:41] <gamemastertom> i remember the earlier days when people thought master mummy was OP because 5 grabs were enough to KO (he does 200 damage)
[0:53:46] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Powerup Backdown: The Backdownening KappaRoss
[0:53:49] <+IncredibleMeh> Items...Giant Arms... NotLikeThis
[0:53:58] <%DensityD> woolieFUN
[0:54:03] <TheDrown> Also takes varying amounts of punches to stop an incoming punch. Like light arm vs heavy will take multiple light punches but heavy vs heavy will cancel out in one
[0:54:03] <Sebthemachinist> YO WE TAKIN’ UP ARMS IN HERE?! lytKILLGOKU lytKILLGOKU lytKILLGOKU lytKILLGOKU lytKILLGOKU

[0:55:32] <gamemastertom> that's the Mintendo Noodle House
[0:55:38] <%DensityD> FEED
[0:55:39] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> The slimegirls are failing Reggie
[0:55:41] <cyrusvgz> My uncle's cat works at EVO and says there's gonna be a secret main stage tournament for ARMS and Pokken
[0:55:50] <premmylive> It’s harder to jump over arms with vertical hitboxes
[0:55:58] <premmylive> Than horizontal ones
[0:56:01] <+rooked4> Those arms are a no for me
[0:56:08] <%Irridium> you have to dodge into it
[0:56:18] <+fizzguy47> vin diesel is senator armstrong
[0:56:21] <%DensityD> big = slow but maybe more curving
[0:56:26] <cyrusvgz> Mechanica a cute.
[0:56:28] <MutedMimic> Bonk
[0:56:36] <NeroInfinite> Guardian is more for defense
[0:56:36] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1232714491890208768
[0:56:38] <@Menitta> i remember the slime guy being really good at launch
[0:56:41] <+IncredibleMeh> Making arms bigger is just a thing for funning around
[0:56:50] <+IncredibleMeh> Also size as almost nothing to do with actual speed
[0:56:51] <YakumoYomi> Bad arm selection
[0:56:54] <gamemastertom> hélix ARMS are a bit on the hard side, guardian specially
[0:56:55] <%Solidnick18> a perfect
[0:56:56] <%DensityD> baby's first rushdown
[0:57:03] <%tearknack> true perfect

[0:57:14] <%Solidnick18> master mummy
[0:57:14] <+rooked4> Helix is a tough one
[0:57:19] <%DensityD> EVEN MORE ASTRAL CHAIN
[0:57:20] <thunderhog> The chain link glasses are great
[0:57:21] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Woolie just wants the Boruto
[0:57:23] <NeroInfinite> but yeah Helix is pretty hard
[0:57:27] <dapperskeleton69> MUMMIES ALIVE

[0:57:45] <dapperskeleton69> WOOOOO
[0:58:17] <premmylive> Almost every character gimmick involves charging somehow so play with that every time
[0:58:26] <thunderhog> SourPls
[0:58:40] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Git em with that big grab Reggie
[0:59:05] <G03933> is this the part in the Ninja battle where you flashback for 6 episodes?
[0:59:09] <dapperskeleton69> just keep schmovin
[0:59:24] <+rooked4> hold block
[0:59:37] <BackwardCap> All the music in this game is underrated too. Soundtrack goes hard.

[1:00:45] <cocovett> charge ya triblaaaaast
[1:00:47] <SixthSun2> THE READS
[1:00:49] <LiteraryFirearms> yeah, classic rock paper scissors there. Guard beats punch, punch beats grab, grab beats guard.
[1:01:01] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> THE SPD
[1:01:03] <thunderhog> Se, the mind game doesnt work if woolie doesnt know how to throw
[1:01:16] <%Irridium> reggie gotta use that super

[1:01:25] <%jiggy_snipe> make something happen, gets punched in face
[1:01:27] <thunderhog> The mine game is guard the whole time, force a throw, and punish the throw
[1:01:31] <featherlan> "8 seconds to make something happen"
[1:01:32] <%DensityD> THAT'S ONE HELL OF A RINNEGAN

[1:03:35] <gamemastertom> fun fact, kid cobra's voice actor voices reaper in the japanese versión of Overwatch
[1:03:38] <powerprotoman> the "big bang" is an emp
[1:03:40] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:03:44] <thunderhog> So that wasnt a confirm, the super activation actually nulls arms next to you
[1:03:48] <MayorRev> Wasn't kid cobra a livestreamer
[1:03:54] <MayorRev> isnt he doing this for subscribers
[1:03:55] <gamemastertom> @MayorRev he is
[1:03:56] <thunderhog> SO supers are less about confirms and more about punishes
[1:03:56] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> @MattoBii Nah they're just pickin em as they play around
[1:03:58] <LiteraryFirearms> Kid Cobra is a livestreamer, yeah.

[1:05:38] <misha_kastrilevich> Is this game still active?
[1:05:45] <mrlastchance1> Would you guys cut your arms off for spring arms?
[1:05:46] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> There's a community around
[1:05:47] <Gutsandlove> yes
[1:05:51] <gamemastertom> fun fact: springman is voice by Peter von gomm, who also voice Megaman X and Frank West, iirc
[1:06:04] <+astroninja0> It's semi active competitively @misha_kastrilevich. Tournaments happen every week

[1:08:18] <+klholland92> So does this game have a competitive scene? I never reallu heard anything about it
[1:08:24] <+astroninja0> It do actually!
[1:08:34] <+astroninja0> It's mainly on discord that all the communication happens
[1:08:43] <+rooked4> the fast fall looks pretty rad actually
[1:08:44] <PleasantLeech> @arcielardor just peek into the top left of the screen
[1:08:44] <+IncredibleMeh> Yeah it's had a pretty small but dedicated following
[1:08:45] <MattoBii> man, I miss this game
[1:08:47] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> @klholland92 Yep, they've been reading bits from a doc that a pretty good dude gave them when looking at things.
[1:08:56] <gamemastertom> @klholland92 it does, astroninja is probably one of the best, apparently i'm the best player in chile, and many others

[1:10:50] <triage0> :o
[1:10:52] <MayorRev> What's this about?
[1:10:52] <%Irridium> what platform
[1:10:55] <BackwardCap> The main problem with this game is that its more fun to play than it is to watch.
[1:10:56] <Sebthemachinist> Here’s to hoping for an Arms 2 that catapults the franchise into the limelight like the Sequel System did for Street Fighter.
[1:10:59] <%DensityD> copy a code
[1:10:59] <+balouie> I reallly liked arms even though I was crappy at it
[1:11:05] <Mahbonk> @SirGO0SE sadly Sprinman and Rex were "too late" apparently
[1:11:07] <BackwardCap> And that there isn't a lot of variance in the gameplay.
[1:11:12] <%Solidnick18> well that's fine
[1:11:12] <+arcielardor> This game gives me so many Virtual On vibes
[1:11:15] <Dragon_Batman> What's the platform for said gifts

[1:24:33] <NeroInfinite> yooo
[1:24:33] <%Solidnick18> oh shit
[1:24:37] <%DensityD> PogChamp
[1:24:41] <%tearknack> wow
[1:24:41] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:24:42] <%Solidnick18> Yooo captain
[1:24:42] <Dragon_Batman> Piledriving them gift subs
[1:24:45] <ScarfDeSmith> holy shit dnoMACHO
[1:24:46] <RadicalWeegee> Oh shiiit
[1:24:49] <%Solidnick18> big sub bomb
[1:24:53] <NeroInfinite> Clap
[1:25:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> my tax returns were very nice this year
[1:25:15] <MattoBii> the dog randomly barfs out a punch, I think
[1:25:15] <%Enemy_In_Disguise> Oh damn, i got bombed
[1:25:17] <RadicalWeegee> YOUR NICE
[1:25:18] <%DensityD> BarQ is passive, right?
[1:25:18] <Jathspuh> I think he just does stuff
[1:25:23] <Jathspuh> on his own
[1:25:28] <gamemastertom> barq punches every 5 seconds, or 1 second after you attack
[1:25:36] <%Solidnick18> sweet
[1:25:48] <%Solidnick18> chaining
[1:26:39] <Dragon_Batman> Right is charged it looks
[1:26:59] <%DensityD> ice max brass all day erry day
[1:27:29] <%tearknack> @WoolieVersus loadouts can be customized, from what i've been told. any character can sue any ARM, afaik
[1:27:33] <+IncredibleMeh> I've fought Brass with Chilla and it is hellish
[1:27:38] <dr_healsgood> is there still no arms character in smash?
[1:27:50] <Dragon_Batman> Nah just SpringMan as an assist
[1:27:50] <%tearknack> jsut an assist trophy
[1:27:51] <%Irridium> nope but don't worry there's another fire emblem
[1:28:03] <dr_healsgood> @Irridium TRU
[1:28:22] <%DensityD> JUST FRAME
[1:28:25] <featherlan> What would be an ARMS character's gimmick?
[1:28:32] <%DensityD> snakes
[1:28:36] <%DensityD> dna strands
[1:28:49] <%DensityD> the mummy heals slowly while blocking
[1:28:58] <%DensityD> you mean in smash?
[1:29:03] <featherlan> Yee
[1:29:05] <Jathspuh> That dash out of shield has some other technical uses too
[1:29:16] <Jathspuh> empowers the next move type of thing
[1:29:31] <PleasantLeech> imagine how much better this game would be if these tutorials were in it?
[1:29:50] <Jathspuh> ^
[1:30:02] <Jathspuh> Might be on a mobile app LUL
[1:30:05] <featherlan> I guess a Smash ARMS character could charge their standard moves for a quick second
[1:30:25] <NeroInfinite> we watchin youtube on twitch what a world
[1:30:38] <Dragon_Batman> Well smash hits are already charged so that just works
[1:31:01] <%SirGO0SE> bubb
[1:31:07] <featherlan> No, I mean aside from smash attacks
[1:31:17] <featherlan> Like.... their neutral jab
[1:31:26] <Jathspuh> @NeroInfinite that's how the big streams make the easiest money
[1:31:27] <featherlan> OH
[1:31:41] <featherlan> The charge gives one of the element boosts
[1:31:41] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:31:42] <%tearknack> @NeroInfinite its been super common for years, lol
[1:31:56] <Dragon_Batman> Would be neat either way
[1:32:15] <MindlessMonks> daaamn
[1:32:41] <%DensityD> punishes
[1:32:50] <%Razputin217> @CaptainPileDriver Thanks for the gift sub!
[1:32:53] <NeroInfinite> If only these tutorials were in the game to begin with
[1:32:59] <featherlan> They could have just as big of a recovery as Bleth
[1:33:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Razputin217 no problem
[1:33:23] <Jathspuh> i didn't know that PogChamp
[1:33:54] <Dragon_Batman> Oooh wow
[1:34:02] <+IncredibleMeh> Good tutorials always make the difference for how accessible a fighting game is, even one like this
[1:34:25] <featherlan> True
[1:34:27] <%Irridium> I mean it makes sense. If your arm's fucked up blocking not gonna be great
[1:34:51] <Dragon_Batman> Makes sense
[1:34:55] <thunderhog> What do you mean you cant block moves with 1 finger?
[1:35:00] <thunderhog> What are you, weak?
[1:35:00] <PleasantLeech> these tutorials are insanely high quality for being fan made
[1:35:13] <featherlan> Wait. What would the range be for an ARMS Smash rep? XD
[1:35:15] <Dragon_Batman> NAh block it with your face
[1:35:21] <%DensityD> I'm almost mad that getting a broken arm will weaken my movement too
[1:35:27] <%DensityD> they disabled my ARM not my LEG
[1:35:39] <%DensityD> but these are special characters
[1:35:46] <premmylive> Arms I smash =Belmont/Lil Mac
[1:35:54] <premmylive> So!
[1:35:58] <premmylive> Arms Lore!
[1:36:03] <Dragon_Batman> Sword character range then?
[1:36:05] <Run44forrest> whens LEGS
[1:36:12] <featherlan> But their arm stretchy
[1:36:12] <%DensityD> EXPLOSION IS SUPER RISKY
[1:36:24] <%Irridium> high risk high reward baby
[1:36:25] <featherlan> LONG RANGE MELEE
[1:36:27] <premmylive> The arms ability is like the X-gene
[1:36:36] <+Clik404> Is ARMS alive?
[1:36:37] <%CaptainPileDriver> @featherlan it would be another belmont character basically
[1:36:39] <Dragon_Batman> I would make em like Belmonts or Corrin like
[1:36:43] <premmylive> Randomly happens to people at any point in their life
[1:36:48] <premmylive> Or even after death
[1:36:52] <premmylive> Like master mummy
[1:37:04] <premmylive> Who woke up one day in a museum
[1:37:04] <featherlan> @CaptainPileDriver Safe mid-range then?
[1:37:11] <featherlan> Just with faster hits
[1:37:14] <premmylive> And entered the tournament to find his family
[1:37:28] <%tearknack> long range good smashes, but with a retracitng hitbox?
[1:37:35] <featherlan> OOOOOHHHHHH
[1:37:39] <featherlan> That's GOOD
[1:37:41] <%CaptainPileDriver> @featherlan maybe, and then some of the specials would be long range reaching and the smash attacks would also be long reaching
[1:37:44] <emeraldskrull> woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO
[1:37:54] <premmylive> When you manifest ARMS ABILTY your arms go crazy nuts
[1:37:57] <%DensityD> you were too busy talking about risky, you missed a part of "priming your explosive arms, thus keeping you safe with good timing"
[1:37:58] <premmylive> With no control
[1:38:01] <+astroninja0> Speaking of Lore, lots of the doing (like mummy's resurrection were the doing of Dr. Coyle
[1:38:07] <%SirGO0SE> psaBig quality
[1:38:09] <featherlan> An ARMS rep would have the BEST grab
[1:38:17] <featherlan> BET
[1:38:17] <thunderhog> So the biggest trick is not to punch directly, but to cut them off with your punches to where they're moving
[1:38:21] <Run44forrest> wtf this isnt the in game tutorial???
[1:38:25] <%DensityD> Dr Coyle and Dr Wily team up when?
[1:38:26] <RAH001> they do other games?
[1:38:27] <%tearknack> or like, you don't take damage, but your smashes can be disabled sort of like Robin?
[1:38:29] <premmylive> The ARMS corporation Makes everyone’s mask
[1:38:30] <Dragon_Batman> I would imagine making an arms smash character either switch arms in some way
[1:38:34] <RAH001> ah nvm
[1:38:38] <premmylive> Which allows them to control their powers
[1:38:44] <+astroninja0> And it's also hinted at that Dr. Coyle may be the mother of the main guy, Spring Man
[1:38:45] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1232714491890208768
[1:38:45] <%DensityD> thank you, ARMS Study Lab
[1:38:50] <@Solidus_113> https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTZKwYfg185LNBgAif4bT_Q
[1:38:52] <+sinistersally> psaBig psaWhat
[1:39:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> @featherlan sadly the arms rep was put into the assist trophy
[1:39:05] <thunderhog> It was like a week 2 launch title doh
[1:39:06] <premmylive> Some people say Max Brass is his dad
[1:39:07] <%Irridium> game sold 2 million
[1:39:15] <MattoBii> I think it just had a lacking tail, like people weren't coming back for later character additions
[1:39:20] <+rooked4> It didnt have any ... legs
[1:39:20] <ReddLynch> i kinda miss ARMS
[1:39:20] <gamemastertom> thia game was released 3 months after the switch released
[1:39:21] <thunderhog> So it took a bit to come out, when BotW was right there
[1:39:21] <%Solidnick18> true
[1:39:23] <%DensityD> SwiftRage SHUT UP I LIKE RED STEEL 2 BabyRage
[1:39:24] <featherlan> I KNOW... -n-
[1:39:24] <%Irridium> yo Red Steel 2 was the shit though
[1:39:27] <+Dr_DangerPhD> seems like at high level its about disabling 1 arm, then doing a mixup confirm into rush
[1:39:34] <%gasgrave> I don't think people realize how good or deep this game actually is
[1:39:35] <Mahbonk> They tried to do content dripping like Splatoon and that didnèt worked as much
[1:39:35] <PleasantLeech> well it's just a fighting game and it's exclusive to what many see as a underpowered console
[1:39:41] <%Wool> Woolie been playing ARMS so much that his BUTT hurts
[1:39:42] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's true
[1:39:43] <+sinistersally> @DensityD red steel 1 tho
[1:39:52] <Dragon_Batman> Maaan Red steel 1
[1:39:55] <featherlan> I really hope ARMS gets a sequel
[1:39:59] <%DensityD> LEGS
[1:40:00] <%SirGO0SE> red steel was farted out
[1:40:03] <premmylive> Red Steel for Switch when?
[1:40:05] <MattoBii> Red Steel and Twilight Princess were launch day
[1:40:06] <gamemastertom> ARMS was actually the best selling console fighter in Japan since 2014, only surpassed by smash
[1:40:10] <chronoxgp> i played at launch then completely stopped
[1:40:11] <GarbageNirvana> Twilight Princess was launch, yeah
[1:40:11] <Gutsandlove> red steel 2 is awesome
[1:40:17] <GarbageNirvana> I should know because I stood in line for that shit
[1:40:27] <+sinistersally> Red Steel 2 Great. Red Steal 1 fart
[1:40:27] <MattoBii> Red Steel 2 is a way better game, but it got slept on because Red Steel 1 was bad
[1:40:30] <+astroninja0> High level is more about good movement and looking for ways to play it safe. Top level play in ARMS is all of that plus good counterpicking, and meter management.
[1:40:33] <Mahbonk> look at him groove
[1:40:37] <+astroninja0> I say this from experience
[1:40:40] <%Ninestempest> 2 was fine
[1:40:46] <Dragon_Batman> Yea, I was at the Times Square release and got Twilight for Wii
[1:40:54] <worldbrand> this game just loves mixing its main theme eh
[1:40:59] <%Ninestempest> it definitely had all right swordplay which is all you could really ask for but everything else about it was not great
[1:41:00] <Dragon_Batman> Such a huge line
[1:41:06] <featherlan> The ARMS theme is gold
[1:41:09] <Mahbonk> Leaf Motif
[1:41:13] <featherlan> The OSTof this game is fantastic
[1:41:24] <+JohnMarkley> hello everyone :) /
[1:41:33] <Dragon_Batman> Heyo
[1:41:39] <%DensityD> hi
[1:41:43] <featherlan> 'Sup
[1:41:57] <MayorRev> these are super well made holy moly
[1:42:01] <%Solidnick18> woolieCHAN
[1:42:10] <featherlan> Y'know what?
[1:42:19] <%DensityD> chicken butt?
[1:42:19] <PleasantLeech> EXTRA
[1:42:22] <Dragon_Batman> This vids are nicely done
[1:42:24] <featherlan> I think I'm gonna try to get ARMS into the local fray
[1:42:32] <premmylive> ArmsStudyLab the GOAT
[1:42:34] <thunderhog> These are actually in the style of the in game tutorials, so their ability to copy them is really impressive
[1:42:36] <%DensityD> RETRACTION PogChamp
[1:43:17] <featherlan> GOD, just IMAGINE that grab range in Smash...
[1:43:17] <%DensityD> learn that timing
[1:43:29] <premmylive> Marty grabs
[1:43:34] <premmylive> Marth
[1:43:34] <Dragon_Batman> Would be alittle different depending on the arm
[1:43:44] <chronoxgp> problem with this game is the pro controller always has the advantage over the joy con users
[1:43:45] <+IncredibleMeh> Nah reggie's got it right
[1:43:57] <%DensityD> short dash into jump
[1:44:12] <+Clik404> Yeah, you gotta wiggle a little before you get it back
[1:44:12] <PleasantLeech> who would be the character that gets into smash? I mean we can all agree spring man is on the bottom of the list right?
[1:44:21] <+Clik404> So you don’t get whacked
[1:44:22] <%DensityD> PogChamp Head start on charging! Never stop charging!
[1:44:24] <thunderhog> The point is once you start in recovery time, you can move in full
[1:44:25] <dapperskeleton69> joy con users= for fun, pro controller users= for glory
[1:44:25] <%Irridium> nah spring man is the most boring so he's top of the list
[1:44:32] <%Irridium> just how japan do
[1:44:33] <powerprotoman> springmans on the top of the lsit unless arms 2 makes minmin the mc
[1:44:52] <premmylive> Spring man makes the most sense but my personal choice is Kobra or Twintell
[1:44:55] <featherlan> Spring Man/Ribbon Girl
[1:45:03] <chronoxgp> should have 4 characters with different arms for the costumes
[1:45:05] <featherlan> Like Byleth when it comes to alts
[1:45:06] <%DensityD> you can not do short dash into full dash, but you could jump
[1:45:10] <premmylive> Min Min is another likely choice since she won the last party crash
[1:45:11] <PleasantLeech> ribbon girl is way better and she has actually unique mechanics
[1:45:13] <%DensityD> or walk, into full dash
[1:45:24] <powerprotoman> springman also allows easy echo fighter springtron
[1:45:30] <premmylive> Yeah
[1:45:32] <PleasantLeech> I think twintelle is one of the most popular though
[1:45:34] <%tearknack> jsut make it ribbon man, with ribbon girl as an alt skin, or vice versa
[1:45:39] <chronoxgp> twin tell or the cop dude ar e cool so is the slime guy and mummy
[1:45:41] <Mvrdok_> Min Min BlessRNG
[1:45:46] <%tearknack> even if my heart says twintelle or minmin
[1:45:46] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:45:47] <featherlan> How about Splatoon-ing it?
[1:46:03] <featherlan> All ARMS characters are relatively close in size
[1:46:06] <premmylive> The characters are a bit too Different for that
[1:46:10] <powerprotoman> they really arnt
[1:46:15] <%tearknack> not really
[1:46:16] <%DensityD> how soon can you charge again?
[1:46:20] <dapperskeleton69> yeh naw
[1:46:31] <powerprotoman> also their defualt arms are radically diffrent besides springman and tron who share defualt arms
[1:46:44] <%DensityD> IT'S LITERALLY VERY FLEXIBLE
[1:46:51] <%DensityD> OpieOP
[1:46:54] <premmylive> Honestly you could make the specials and smashes into alt arms
[1:46:57] <featherlan> So then the first two, they're basically the face of the game
[1:47:16] <premmylive> Yeah but they’re not quite Ken and Ryu stylistically
[1:47:19] <%DensityD> PogChamp flash kick
[1:47:21] <thunderhog> Yeah, so minmin on backdash has a parry kick
[1:47:23] <%tearknack> sping man, spring girl, twintelle, ninja man, minmin, i think you could have them all as the same character?
[1:47:29] <PleasantLeech> it's so boring to just do the face especially for this game
[1:47:29] <%tearknack> splatoon style
[1:47:59] <featherlan> Yeah, but when it comes to the most recognizable character, that's when it gets tricky
[1:48:16] <%DensityD> wtf scorpion arms
[1:48:17] <%tearknack> i wodner if people would have been more happy with 3 houses rep if it wasn't byleth?
[1:48:19] <%DensityD> wow this game
[1:48:30] <%tearknack> like what if it was dimitri, edelgarde, or claude?
[1:48:36] <+IncredibleMeh> I'm so glad I found these tutorials, because yeah they are amazingly well put together
[1:48:40] <%CalebHatesGames> Doubtful, but maybe.
[1:48:41] <Dragon_Batman> I mean then you would get people who would be like but the house I wanted tho
[1:48:41] <%Irridium> it is boring but that's just what happens 99% of the time. That's why Killer Instinct going for The Arbiter rather than Master Chief was so hype
[1:48:43] <Run44forrest> twintelle Kreygasm
[1:48:54] <featherlan> Would the house lord be like Pokemon Trainer?
[1:49:04] <%tearknack> no i meant like
[1:49:08] <%tearknack> just picking one
[1:49:11] <featherlan> Oh
[1:49:14] <Dragon_Batman> Which it would have been Edelgard cuz she is super popular
[1:49:17] <%tearknack> doing it as pokemon trianer sounds wierd
[1:49:31] <featherlan> Just one lord would have been worse
[1:49:35] <%tearknack> i sitll haven
[1:49:40] <featherlan> Have you SEEN 3H fans?
[1:49:42] <premmylive> That’s actually cool
[1:49:45] <Dragon_Batman> I think the Poke trainer would have been fun
[1:49:49] <featherlan> They're like WOLVES
[1:49:52] <%DensityD> Mummy = fatty
[1:49:53] <Dragon_Batman> for the Lords I mean
[1:49:53] <premmylive> And would have been more representative of FE
[1:50:10] <featherlan> That's what I'm saying
[1:50:16] <premmylive> The same way Poketrainer is most like poke games
[1:50:18] <%tearknack> i still haven't finished 3h, i've only done (part of) the blue lions route, and edelgarde is still my favourite lol
[1:50:30] <Dragon_Batman> Nice
[1:50:30] <featherlan> It either had to be ALL three lords, or Byleth
[1:50:40] <premmylive> I mean
[1:50:44] <%tearknack> yeha pokemon trainer is great
[1:50:44] <%CaptainPileDriver> man i love all the stuff i can do with characters that used to be unusable in dbfz
[1:50:54] <premmylive> Let’s coulda been hangin on the side like trainer
[1:51:00] <Dragon_Batman> I'm happy Byleth at least had alot of thought put into them
[1:51:09] <%Wool> bruh why is there so much
[1:51:10] <featherlan> ^^^
[1:51:14] <%tearknack> incorporating the idea of switching pokemon depending on the situaiton is aces
[1:51:15] <PleasantLeech> I own this game and didn't know
[1:51:15] <chronoxgp> regrettably i will have played more gran blue versus than FE in about a week
[1:51:21] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[1:51:28] <Dragon_Batman> Fair
[1:51:29] <%Irridium> byleth's is actually fine but it's just not as exciting as literally every other fighter in the pass.
[1:51:29] <%Wool> when are we gonna learn about Korean backdashing
[1:51:32] <%jiggy_snipe> I think if Byleth was the 1st dlc character, no one would complain
[1:51:35] <+IncredibleMeh> yeyeye YABUKI
[1:51:40] <%Solidnick18> how many videos are their?
[1:51:41] <featherlan> I'm ALMOST done with BL, but I've been distracted with drawing
[1:51:48] <Dragon_Batman> I think Byleth should have been middle
[1:51:51] <%SirGO0SE> oh shit someone gave me a gift sub! <3 gotta check who it was but thank you in advance <3
[1:51:52] <Saltmeisterr> oh right
[1:51:52] <%tearknack> @chronoxgp i mean the fighting game, and not the gacha, is nothing to be ashamed of
[1:51:54] <premmylive> It’s so much because Arms is so good
[1:51:57] <+Irridium> byleth's final smash also looks hilariously bad too. Sothis dot jpeg
[1:51:59] <featherlan> Imagine ending on Joker
[1:52:03] <powerprotoman> yabuki was a monster
[1:52:04] <Saltmeisterr> this ded game
[1:52:04] <%Irridium> with mouthflaps
[1:52:08] <Dragon_Batman> Like keep Joker as first to bring excitement then half way bring them in
[1:52:09] <gamemastertom> you can also use he wind element into a rush, usually called a "wind Yabuki"
[1:52:15] <%tearknack> yeah thats the one part of byleth that i actually dislike
[1:52:16] <featherlan> Byleth's FS is indeed very bad
[1:52:18] <Dragon_Batman> and end it with Terry or something
[1:52:19] <PleasantLeech> yeah you have to save the best for last
[1:52:21] <%tearknack> the final smash is sooooo bad
[1:52:25] <chronoxgp> i jus don't understand why fire emblem wasn't on the Wii U
[1:52:32] <featherlan> It was tho
[1:52:38] <featherlan> Tokyo Mirage Sessions
[1:52:39] <+R_BChe> cause 3ds was still alive
[1:52:40] <featherlan> XD
[1:52:40] <Jathspuh> the woolie character
[1:52:45] <%Irridium> Every other final smash for the fighter pass characters look so great and detailed and sothis is just... woof
[1:52:45] <%Solidnick18> I see
[1:52:56] <Dragon_Batman> Too much time in development to make it to Wii U?
[1:52:56] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:52:56] <Jathspuh> Star Platinum: Mayan Edition
[1:53:04] <bleugh> does anyone still play this game
[1:53:08] <+IncredibleMeh> That S shaped stage is corner pressure central
[1:53:08] <Saltmeisterr> no
[1:53:34] <featherlan> I'm still praying to the Nintendo gods that No More Heroes gets SOMETHING in Smash
[1:53:41] <Dragon_Batman> Yea I also think Byleth's super had a what the hell do we do kinda thing too
[1:53:43] <+R_BChe> a spirit :)
[1:53:44] <Saltmeisterr> and I don't blame people for dropping this
[1:53:46] <chronoxgp> i stopped playing when i realized the single player was too hard for joy cons
[1:53:52] <Saltmeisterr> theres not much there to chew
[1:54:02] <featherlan> They coulda had the Lords in the FS
[1:54:12] <+IncredibleMeh> If you hold the thumbstick down while pick your arms you can select without it showing on the menu
[1:54:13] <MattoBii> Your's
[1:54:23] <%DensityD> RUSH
[1:54:23] <bleugh> your's
[1:54:24] <%jiggy_snipe> if anyone cares, Black Desert Online (that game with the really detailed character creation) is free on Steam to March 2
[1:54:27] <featherlan> As that synergy thing 3H has
[1:54:28] <%Irridium> your's
[1:54:29] <premmylive> “Not much there to chew” : Said an hour into tutorials
[1:54:34] <%Solidnick18> on rush huh
[1:54:35] <Dragon_Batman> That would be neat but that would probably take more time than they would have wanted
[1:54:38] <%tearknack> @featherlan is NMH not even like, a spirit? huh
[1:54:46] <featherlan> Not yet, sadly
[1:54:47] <cyrusvgz> Free forever?
[1:54:50] <%DensityD> EXHEAVY
[1:54:56] <premmylive> But there definitely sees more “content” in arms 2
[1:55:01] <premmylive> Needs
[1:55:02] <%jiggy_snipe> i believe so
[1:55:02] <chronoxgp> i dunno i was surpised Snake was even a character MGS2 was pretty violen
[1:55:16] <featherlan> BAYONETTA is in the game
[1:55:18] <%tearknack> @jiggy_snipe i got it today, installed it, realized that classes are gender/race locked, and uninstalled
[1:55:21] <+chiluzza> when we getting ARMS in EVO
[1:55:25] <featherlan> Travis can get in for sure
[1:55:36] <%jiggy_snipe> well then, that sucks
[1:55:41] <MattoBii> ARMS got into the first EVO Japan, but nothing since
[1:55:42] <%Irridium> Agent Francis York Morgan for Smash
[1:55:44] <Dragon_Batman> Even then they toned Bayo a little
[1:55:51] <%tearknack> yeah the character creatoor in BDO is super detailed
[1:55:54] <Saltmeisterr> i would like to see more moves aside from punch/block/grab/dash
[1:55:55] <featherlan> Just tone down Travis
[1:56:05] <%tearknack> but its also surprisingly limited
[1:56:10] <%tearknack> who knew
[1:56:17] <premmylive> I want standing jukes/dodges
[1:56:28] <cyrusvgz> They could put out the character creator standalone and I would play with it for hours.
[1:56:31] <chronoxgp> travis' special throws his sticky wet rags at you from his garbage horrifying the other player
[1:56:38] <%jiggy_snipe> I kinda wanna make a character but not play lol
[1:56:46] <%DensityD> heavy all day erry day
[1:56:48] <Dragon_Batman> Francis York Morgan would be too strong
[1:56:48] <%tearknack> yeah thats all i wanted to do
[1:56:51] <%DensityD> WAIT NO
[1:56:52] <%tearknack> so i got my moneys worth
[1:56:56] <dapperskeleton69> oh, BIG
[1:56:58] <%tearknack> even though i payed nothing lol
[1:56:58] <featherlan> I've been wondering on what Travis could have as a moveset
[1:57:02] <%DensityD> sweet spots?
[1:57:04] <+heroicbrawlerKK> love this game. hope they get a sequel one day.
[1:57:06] <PleasantLeech> someday we'll just have the doll maker video game we all want
[1:57:19] <@Solidus_113> Range or damage scaling
[1:57:25] <dapperskeleton69> @featherlan i imagine he might work similarly to shulk
[1:57:38] <%tearknack> imagine a DMC or Bayo game, with char creation
[1:57:40] <%SirGO0SE> i feel like maybe it will get a huge dlc at some point but a second game on the switch would be a surprise
[1:57:44] <%tearknack> i would be soooo in
[1:57:46] <dapperskeleton69> with a beam recharge mechanic
[1:57:50] <cyrusvgz> Bro, I want a standalone character creator so badly. I have art things I wanna do but I can't draw and I can't 3D model.
[1:57:50] <featherlan> Like Shulk but with Marth/Lucina sice B?
[1:58:04] <%SirGO0SE> well another huge dlc
[1:58:05] <%apexyudha> This game is a lot more in depth than I thought...Jesus
[1:58:05] <dapperskeleton69> maybe
[1:58:07] <featherlan> That CHANGES depending on beam katana
[1:58:23] <%jiggy_snipe> ikr, after I saw that creator, I wanted every game to have something like it
[1:58:31] <premmylive> I really want Nintendo to kinda stagger their good Competitive game releases
[1:58:32] <Dragon_Batman> Down B for different KAtanas?
[1:58:33] <%DensityD> combo is safest
[1:58:34] <dapperskeleton69> what if travis became the style switch character
[1:58:38] <%SirGO0SE> spring man as a dhalsim would have been so good for smash t_t its hard not to think about
[1:58:51] <%tearknack> i mean dhalsim in smash is wierd
[1:58:53] <featherlan> I would be OKAY with that
[1:58:53] <dapperskeleton69> different katanas for different movesets/bonuses
[1:59:00] <featherlan> TOTALLY FINE
[1:59:03] <%tearknack> i'm not into smash at all, so correct me if i'm wrong
[1:59:06] <waffleandman> the game that was forgotten
[1:59:08] <%DensityD> this is the one?
[1:59:08] <%tearknack> but is that not already a thing?
[1:59:09] <Dragon_Batman> Taht would make him unique enough in smash
[1:59:17] <dapperskeleton69> plus it has a charge mwchanic similar to inkling where you gotta block and mash up/down to recharge
[1:59:22] <premmylive> So like Splat3, wait, arms 2 wait, Something else
[1:59:27] <%SirGO0SE> theres a lot of sword dominance in smash and a dhalsim to out poke them would have been great
[1:59:27] <%tearknack> like, there's characters that are ranged keepaway with teleports
[1:59:38] <%DensityD> PogChamp SUPER ARMOR
[1:59:40] <thunderhog> Rush is also a parry
[1:59:42] <%Ninestempest> PogChamp
[1:59:43] <featherlan> Travis can't be shown jacking it thoug, Smash is for good boys and girls
[1:59:44] <+chiluzza> COUNTER
[1:59:53] <Dragon_Batman> Shadow Counter!
[2:00:01] <dapperskeleton69> hes not jacking it hes cjarging his beam sword Kappa
[2:00:01] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1232714491890208768
[2:00:03] <rustedfish> phone died, what happun
[2:00:06] <%tearknack> @featherlan its sticky cause he spilled orange juice on it
[2:00:08] <PleasantLeech> it's a devil trigger
[2:00:15] <chronoxgp> Travis had to wave his beam saber in NMH2 because parents complained
[2:00:21] <Applecannon63> I could see Travis just shake like a soda can
[2:00:24] <featherlan> Guys, we all know damn well what Travis is doing
[2:00:25] <thunderhog> Basicly you either wanna combo rush, or save it as a punish
[2:00:32] <dapperskeleton69> YEAH BUT THE KIDS DONT
[2:00:33] <Dragon_Batman> At least Travis would have his throws
[2:00:51] <chronoxgp> there are flashlights that really charge like that tho
[2:00:55] <featherlan> How to implement his throws....
[2:01:00] <Applecannon63> Just travis do a handy motion than a jacking off
[2:01:00] <%DensityD> woolieGLORY
[2:01:01] <%tearknack> what parents are buying their kids NMH
[2:01:04] <%tearknack> and then complaining
[2:01:07] <dapperskeleton69> his throws are just throws
[2:01:11] <%tearknack> about it being too dirty
[2:01:15] <dapperskeleton69> back throw is suplex
[2:01:20] <+cowkid222> guys just think of the Santa Destroy stage though. And the music! (assuming a smash conversation is happening here, I got here late)
[2:01:21] <wegood456> MUDAMUDAMUDA
[2:01:25] <Dragon_Batman> Yea the throws are just in by default
[2:01:25] <featherlan> His throws are the only throws that don't throw
[2:01:26] <dapperskeleton69> down throw is dropping on their head
[2:01:27] <@Solidus_113> what is this term
[2:01:30] <featherlan> Instead, they have stun
[2:01:33] <cascadepersona> I heard there would be arms and came immediately.
[2:01:34] <%DensityD> option select
[2:01:40] <%SirGO0SE> woolieGLORY
[2:01:44] <guymontag0> Think this game should’ve played like Power Stone
[2:01:45] <%Wool> GRAB-BREAK REFRESH
[2:01:45] <wegood456> You ready to play?
[2:01:53] <guymontag0> Love the characters and designs
[2:02:03] <PleasantLeech> there was way more tech than I was expecting
[2:02:05] <%Wool> bruh how videos are there
[2:02:05] <dapperskeleton69> okay but heres the thing
[2:02:09] <%Wool> how many*
[2:02:09] <%DensityD> many
[2:02:09] <crimsonsaens> Always good to only watch one or two guides per play session
[2:02:18] <+dmtjinni> Woolz
[2:02:19] <Saltmeisterr> i love the designs in the game
[2:02:21] <Applecannon63> Travis Final Smash should just be his spirit animal the sex tiger
[2:02:21] <dapperskeleton69> how we gonna implement the style system for dante in smash
[2:02:22] <Dragon_Batman> Wow that is alot more than I thought
[2:02:24] <%tearknack> ngl, i don't even own (or plan to buy, cause nintendo games never go on sale) ARMS, and i wanna watch these tutorials
[2:02:24] <PleasantLeech> fug
[2:02:26] <GeltonZ> Oh snap! Chat how long has Woolie been ARMSing? Has he played yet?
[2:02:34] <%Wool> the 13 minute video might be the most important tech
[2:02:38] <%DensityD> visit ARMS Study Lab Tips and Tourneys on youtube
[2:02:48] <chronoxgp> dude just play all you need to know is pro controller > joy con
[2:02:50] <dapperskeleton69> would style have a part to play, or would style be an arbitrary thing
[2:02:52] <%DensityD> !uptime
[2:02:52] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 2 minutes
[2:02:53] <Dragon_Batman> @dapperskeleton69 You have to taunt to raise a level and get more for your moves
[2:02:57] <+cowkid222> Dante style switch can be his taunts. 4 taunts and he does the snaps
[2:03:00] <%Irridium> hope there's a video that just says "SHIN ARMS {REQUIEM}
[2:03:02] <%tearknack> @GeltonZ they only actually played a little bit, they've mostly been wathcing these surprisingly weell made fan tutorials
[2:03:07] <%DensityD> @GeltonZ they did some warm up matches
[2:03:14] <dapperskeleton69> okay but you cant taunt in online
[2:03:23] <%DensityD> hall wugging
[2:03:33] <Dragon_Batman> Dante can now Kappa, honestly didn't know that
[2:03:35] <+cowkid222> exception made for Dante
[2:03:35] <%tearknack> @Irridium ARMS 2: ARMS of the DEVIL
[2:03:38] <GeltonZ> @tearknack @DensityD Alright thanks. Sounds like I should look for my copy and ready up then!
[2:03:43] <Dragon_Batman> So Shulk nuetral B
[2:03:43] <dapperskeleton69> so im thinking style would just be an arbitrary mechanic with no effect on the match
[2:03:50] <%DensityD> WHEN'S ONLINE?
[2:03:53] <dapperskeleton69> but dante's winscreen gives a ranking
[2:03:58] <%Irridium> ARMS Beyond: LEGS
[2:04:00] <Saltmeisterr> Arms Double Upper
[2:04:06] <+dmtjinni> Lets watch!
[2:04:17] <Applecannon63> Doomslayer's gimmick is glory kills in a form of Little Mac's power meter and super armor
[2:04:19] <featherlan> GLASS SHATTER for his win screen
[2:04:21] <Dragon_Batman> Yea he would be the only character with a baked in style rank
[2:04:27] <+cowkid222> if you win with a D ranking, did you really win?
[2:04:31] <%tearknack> @WoolieVersus brain is FED
[2:04:33] <dapperskeleton69> like when the match is over and dante wins, the glass shatters and you get your style grading
[2:04:34] <%DensityD> FEED
[2:04:38] <waffleandman> SourPLs
[2:04:40] <Mvrdok_> Arms to study, lab, tourney and chill
[2:04:42] <VJdarkworld> hashtag doom slayer and dante for ARMS 2
[2:04:44] <Applecannon63> Woolies brain is dummy filled
[2:04:45] <featherlan> WAIT
[2:04:45] <Dragon_Batman> Just rematch and self detruct if you get a D
[2:04:49] <featherlan> BEFORE I FORGET
[2:04:57] <featherlan> What would Travis have as a FS???
[2:05:03] <MattoBii> oh god, snake park
[2:05:07] <Saltmeisterr> FS is tiger
[2:05:08] <dapperskeleton69> ANARCHY IN THE GALAXY
[2:05:11] <+Metaternal> Snake Park LUL
[2:05:12] <+astroninja0> Oh no...poor mummy. This is like his worst MU
[2:05:14] <Applecannon63> The tiger or the glastonberru
[2:05:18] <thunderhog> Oh hey, the banned stage
[2:05:18] <Dragon_Batman> His bike would come in maybe
[2:05:22] <%tearknack> @WoolieVersus also, colour changes are hold down L3, and then tilt directions
[2:05:22] <+cowkid222> or the giant robot he used literally once
[2:05:23] <%Irridium> wonder red really should be in smash but he never will feelsbadman
[2:05:24] <%CaptainPileDriver> there really needs to be a penalty in dbfz for jumping back jump jump, like fuck.
[2:05:31] <MattoBii> bird p
[2:05:33] <dapperskeleton69> okay no i will fight you
[2:05:39] <%CaptainPileDriver> put in the ggcrd penalty of being to much of a coward
[2:05:42] <%DensityD> he's already on a beyblade
[2:05:44] <dapperskeleton69> we NEED anarchy in the galaxy as travis' FS
[2:05:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> *ggxrd
[2:05:52] <%DensityD> mummy has battle top advantage
[2:05:53] <+RealPT1> Best Song, Worst Stage
[2:05:54] <Dragon_Batman> Losing meter would do it
[2:05:55] <Saltmeisterr> if the boards where removed would this be legal?
[2:06:02] <Dragon_Batman> I agree
[2:06:04] <+cowkid222> which one is anarchy again? the giant explosion?
[2:06:07] <%DensityD> GET ON A TOP
[2:06:09] <thunderhog> This stage is very vanilla without the tops
[2:06:10] <%tearknack> have they not even noticed the beyblade
[2:06:14] <%Solidnick18> Bird up
[2:06:17] <@Solidus_113> Reggie has Beyblade advantage
[2:06:18] <dapperskeleton69> yeah, the giant explosion with the hype effects
[2:06:19] <thunderhog> but with em, this stage is literally the worst stage in game
[2:06:19] <+IncredibleMeh> You gotta HOLD the dodge button
[2:06:21] <+dmtjinni> This for Fun or Glory Episode?
[2:06:26] <thunderhog> Just a fight to get on a beyblade
[2:06:29] <%DensityD> TOO EARLY
[2:06:30] <%Ninestempest> LUL
[2:06:31] <@Solidus_113> woolieGLORY
[2:06:42] <+dmtjinni> LUL
[2:06:43] <+goufuem> @Saltmeisterr It'd still be too big of a stage.
[2:06:52] <dapperskeleton69> this is for glory
[2:07:00] <dapperskeleton69> aka, SUMBODY GETTIN FUUUUUCKED
[2:07:10] <Dragon_Batman> The guest couldn't make it
[2:07:10] <+cowkid222> what if the FS rolls the roulette and he gets anarchy, or strawberry, or the tiger. just thinking, just thinking
[2:07:10] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:07:17] <Dragon_Batman> But left some docs
[2:07:25] <Saltmeisterr> there was a guest?
[2:07:26] <dapperskeleton69> that would actually be pretty cool cowkid
[2:07:27] <+dmtjinni> Comments gona be mad slaty LUL
[2:07:38] <featherlan> YO. NO MORE HEROES MUSIC IN SMASH
[2:07:43] <dapperskeleton69> but would they have different effects or be the same effect with different grapgics
[2:07:48] <featherlan> A SOUNDTRACK TO RIVAL P5
[2:07:52] <dapperskeleton69> YO
[2:07:56] <+dmtjinni> Wat
[2:08:02] <featherlan> PHILISTINE INSTRUMENTAL
[2:08:10] <+cowkid222> that's all I've ever wanted! just the theme, holy shit man, it'd be amazing
[2:08:13] <dapperskeleton69> KILL OR BE KILLED REMIX
[2:08:14] <%Irridium> when's Gene from God Hand for smash. Final Smash is the Roulette Wheel. Dragon kick their ass into the milky way
[2:08:17] <Applecannon63> Not just only No more heroes music in smash but Killer7 music included
[2:08:18] <MattoBii> there's a reason this stage eventually got banned in ranked online LUL
[2:08:19] <chronoxgp> reaper, reaper
[2:08:24] <chronoxgp> tell me somehting
[2:08:31] <%DensityD> what kind of people are standing in this crowd?
[2:08:34] <Saltmeisterr> Orca Force tho
[2:08:35] <Dragon_Batman> Would love to hear a remix of some songs if that happened
[2:08:36] <TheDrown> "This is where it gets real" Gets the only stage banned from ranked LUL
[2:08:36] <dapperskeleton69> ORCA FORCE
[2:08:41] <+cowkid222> oh god the skng from killer7. you all know the song.
[2:08:48] <Applecannon63> YOU'RE GODDAMN PHILISTINE
[2:08:50] <%Ninestempest> that parry timing looks VERY tight
[2:08:53] <featherlan> Or the Mid-boss theme from Travis Strikes Again
[2:08:56] <%Ninestempest> gonna take some practice
[2:08:57] <problemagic> im buckshot
[2:08:58] <jubejube56> I feel like adding a god hand character to smash would almost be an insult to every other Nintendo character that didn't make it in
[2:09:00] <%DensityD> good disable
[2:09:04] <dapperskeleton69> real talk philistine would only be instrumental in smash
[2:09:17] <%Solidnick18> orca force is great
[2:09:17] <featherlan> Duh
[2:09:17] <dapperskeleton69> they would NOT put those lyrics in
[2:09:18] <featherlan> XD
[2:09:24] <problemagic> use the gun!
[2:09:28] <%Solidnick18> what the hell is going on?
[2:09:32] <featherlan> That's why I said Inst!
[2:09:36] <thunderhog> @WoolieVersus So for the record, this stage is normally banned. Even online this stage never shows up on random matches. the tops give too much momentum to whoever lands a knockdown
[2:09:38] <dapperskeleton69> yo get "stop hanging DJs" in smash
[2:09:38] <%Irridium> I mean that's fine. Snake Eater's only instrumental and that's still good
[2:09:47] <chronoxgp> How about Hatsune Miku for smash? She could attack with celery
[2:09:47] <problemagic> dragon install
[2:09:47] <%DensityD> Dr Coyle seems bad with double heavy
[2:09:47] <MattoBii> @WoolieVersus this stage actually got banned in ranked
[2:09:54] <Dragon_Batman> Two different Snake Eaters too
[2:10:01] <+dmtjinni> we livin!
[2:10:02] <dapperskeleton69> WE ARE FINALLY COWBOYS
[2:10:03] <featherlan> Philistine, We Are Finally Cowboys, N.M.H., It's Kill or Be Killed, what else...?
[2:10:10] <VJdarkworld> hashtag platform from ARMS for smash
[2:10:11] <%tearknack> @WoolieVersus colour change is a thing
[2:10:12] <PleasantLeech> double heavy in general is pretty risky
[2:10:19] <%tearknack> @WoolieVersus hold down l3, tilt directions
[2:10:20] <dapperskeleton69> We are finally cowboys remix?
[2:10:21] <thunderhog> @WoolieVersus L3 and hold a direction
[2:10:21] <featherlan> Gotta get something from TSA
[2:10:22] <%Wool> L3 and move in a direction
[2:10:22] <%Irridium> L3, a direction, and confirm
[2:10:23] <MattoBii> L3 while holding a direction
[2:10:27] <%DensityD> MANGO SENTINEL
[2:10:32] <PleasantLeech> l3 and hold a direction
[2:10:41] <Applecannon63> its kill or be killed would be altered
[2:10:48] <%Wool> MIGHT AND BYTE AND WHITE
[2:10:50] <dapperskeleton69> @featherlan stop hanging DJs aka destroyman's theme
[2:10:52] <Dragon_Batman> Some of the alts are kool, I remember
[2:10:54] <thunderhog> and its a SECRET
[2:10:56] <thunderhog> SERIOUSLY WHY
[2:11:04] <%Irridium> because Nintendo
[2:11:06] <MutedMimic> LUL
[2:11:07] <Saltmeisterr> SourPls
[2:11:07] <problemagic> wait is the cute one Woolie?
[2:11:07] <jubejube56> Might and Byte was just Astral Chain all along
[2:11:09] <featherlan> Electric Thunder Tiger II - Electro Triple Star's boss theme
[2:11:11] <Dragon_Batman> Makes no sense, the game doesn't even tell you right?
[2:11:22] <%tearknack> @problemagic no, reggie is cuter
[2:11:27] <%Wool> the game tells you there are colors, but not how to get them
[2:11:31] <%DensityD> reggie, jump and dash
[2:11:34] <Dragon_Batman> Wild
[2:11:35] <MattoBii> the dog is also a trampoline
[2:11:35] <%DensityD> be mobile
[2:11:35] <NeroInfinite> Look at all those GOO MEN
[2:11:38] <%tearknack> @problemagic (woolie is the gilr in the robot)
[2:11:42] <Saltmeisterr> toob men
[2:11:45] <%Wool> You Cannot Pet the Dog in ARMS
[2:11:52] <+RealPT1> Reggie to focused
[2:11:55] <dapperskeleton69> we would probably also get a remix of the minigame music in travis' stage @featherlan
[2:11:55] <Applecannon63> so do is straight up Leroy's little Sugar?
[2:11:55] <featherlan> You can pet him
[2:11:57] <%DensityD> FINAL DESTINATION ONLY
[2:12:01] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[2:12:02] <featherlan> With your FIST
[2:12:02] <thunderhog> @WoolieVersus For reggie, when you block the dog gets summoned in front of you, and you can jump off the dog for air gimmicks
[2:12:06] <PleasantLeech> you can punch them tho

[2:24:42] <MattoBii> some modes are player 1 only
[2:24:44] <dapperskeleton69> @featherlan theyd probably remix samurai summer
[2:24:58] <+cowkid222> @woolieversus it randomly picks a game type, sometimes the second person is included. sometimes not.

[2:25:11] <featherlan> Wait, all this talk, but none on the STAGE?

[2:33:29] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[2:33:34] <thunderhog> @WoolieVersus It auto picks rotates when you go online with 2 people
[2:33:38] <%Wool> stream sniping is very hard
[2:34:00] <%SirGO0SE> on the bright side its good to know there is a healthy amount of people playing
[2:34:03] <thunderhog> Also you might wanna move into a new room cause you're gonna be stuck with the same people if you stay in a single room
[2:34:12] <Dragon_Batman> Shulk having the Menado arts really brings that character out
[2:34:15] <%tearknack> isn't this character supposed to be able to grow a third arm somehow?
[2:34:21] <Fujiwara_92> big wipouts in this match
[2:34:33] <@Solidus_113> Or make a countdown for when you're going to enter party mode
[2:34:34] <GeltonZ> I managed to get into the lobby you WERE in after you left
[2:34:36] <problemagic> I grew a third arm once and it bankrupted my entire family
[2:34:41] <problemagic> bernie pls

[2:34:57] <%SirGO0SE> HEYYY
[2:35:02] <Dragon_Batman> Popstar I think
[2:35:08] <PleasantLeech> jumping in and out probably makes it less likely to match up
[2:35:13] <+rooked4> Max Steel
[2:35:18] <dapperskeleton69> im gonna move forward and swing my ARMS, and if you get hit its your own fault
[2:35:21] <marvel877> Ribbon Girl's a pop idol, yeah.

[3:40:34] <%SirGO0SE> @bootysteve its early access
[3:40:35] <%tearknack> maybe its cause i never played powerstone but this game does not do it for me
[3:40:41] <%tearknack> it smostly the aesthetic, relaly
[3:40:41] <premmylive> Two “sleazy business guy” characters in one game
[3:40:53] <%DensityD> BIG CLAP

[3:43:14] <%SirGO0SE> this game hasnt even been in early access a month
[3:43:21] <%tearknack> is it jsut me or does originelle look like
[3:43:22] <zayasu> atpCap
[3:43:24] <%tearknack> oh, nevermind
[3:43:25] <Dutchpotato> yes
[3:43:27] <Hellarussian> it is
[3:43:30] <%jiggy_snipe> yes
[3:43:31] <Dutchpotato> that's goku's line
[3:43:33] <Dragon_Batman> LUL
[3:43:43] <%DensityD> you need 2 more friends
[3:43:49] <%tearknack> i was gonna say that her face looked les shuman and more like the wierdoes form the dark Crystal
[3:43:50] <%DensityD> I want to see 4 player
[3:44:06] <%tearknack> but i guess it was jsut the angle of the model in the character select screen
[3:44:22] <Dragon_Batman> I could see it
[3:44:32] <%StaceMcGate> nah her face is scary
[3:44:43] <+boondoggle42> gelflings
[3:44:44] <GarbageNirvana> Originelle is just DeviantArt the Character huh
[3:44:48] <%Superbro64> I will say, the concept of angel/devil wings and halos ruined the idea of character design itself
[3:44:48] <%tearknack> her face is wierd, but it did look more human at a better angle
[3:44:50] <%SirGO0SE> i think the point of originelle is that she is not original yeah lol
[3:44:52] <Hellarussian> its the weird 90's anime face
[3:44:59] <%tearknack> originelle remind sme of
[3:45:00] <%tearknack> um
[3:45:04] <%tearknack> that oen yugioh card
[3:45:07] <%yeknomlive> like the how to draw anime books
[3:45:11] <Hellarussian> Change of Heart?
[3:45:12] <%StaceMcGate> if she has a move that teleports behind an opponent she is full deviant art
[3:45:19] <%tearknack> yeah, Change of Heart
[3:45:27] <%DensityD> SHOULD HE HYPE MOVE IN LIGHT FORM OR IN DARK FORM!?!!
[3:45:32] <%CaptainPileDriver> dashcon forever the scam of tumblr
[3:45:33] <MayorRev> T H E R E
[3:45:41] <%Superbro64> how to draw anime books must made bank back in the day
[3:45:44] <%SirGO0SE> the stages in this are sick
[3:45:58] <Dragon_Batman> I feel like Dark form hype move would be more edgy
[3:45:59] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1232714491890208768
[3:46:01] <%SirGO0SE> i wonder if you can kick someone through the window
[3:46:06] <%SirGO0SE> GEESEU
[3:46:07] <%tearknack> her character design actually looks pretty neat in dark form, ngl
[3:46:19] <%DensityD> aw, stingray blew the hype meter
[3:46:20] <%Superbro64> buy low sell high on those hckbne stocks guys
[3:46:36] <@Solidus_113> body explosion?
[3:46:36] <%tearknack> the simple colours make it seem way less overdesigned
[3:46:44] <%tearknack> and there's no wierd thick halo
[3:46:47] <+HarleySilverWolf> so what's the lore?
[3:46:51] <%jiggy_snipe> Morrigan?
[3:46:58] <Dragon_Batman> Was just gonna say
[3:47:02] <+bootysteve> This is giving me a headache to watch
[3:47:05] <%DensityD> REGGIE'S STILLIN X FACTOR
[3:47:10] <%tearknack> the halo looks less like a halo and more like some kind of snakc
[3:47:19] <Hellarussian> Woolie tried to lame it out
[3:47:20] <%tearknack> like the Humpty Dumpty ring things
[3:47:21] <%Superbro64> high five LUL
[3:47:25] <MayorRev> robbed
[3:47:30] <DRAGKUDO> that's literally change of heart from Yugioh
[3:47:40] <heartlesshealer> odd number of characters
[3:47:48] <%tearknack> tbf "half angel, half devil" is not an original idea
[3:48:02] <+HarleySilverWolf> Don't say heck! limesHeck
[3:48:04] <%tearknack> yugioh is probably not the first to have come up with it
[3:48:05] <%SirGO0SE> early access, its getting cool guest characters too @heartlesshealer
[3:48:06] <%StaceMcGate> her name is originelle, I'm sure its a joke
[3:48:13] <@Solidus_113> Elevator fight!
[3:48:29] <TigerClaws12> heck
[3:48:29] <%SirGO0SE> woosh @StaceMcGate
[3:48:30] <%tearknack> also yeah, the character is supposed to be donut steel
[3:48:36] <Hellarussian> if only this game had a hedgehog that could teleport behind you
[3:48:41] <%StaceMcGate> was that antfish?
[3:48:42] <heartlesshealer> @SirGO0SE Cool! Though I was more referring to how they tried everyone but Heckbane in an actual fight so far
[3:48:54] <%Superbro64> is that a t hawk special move?
[3:48:57] <%SirGO0SE> ah got ya
[3:49:00] <%Superbro64> with gen's idle stance>
[3:49:01] <%DensityD> in this game it's not called an install, it's "Swole"
[3:49:09] <Dragon_Batman> This is a fun track
[3:49:24] <Dragon_Batman> That is a great taunt
[3:50:03] <%Superbro64> it's kinda a funny
[3:50:22] <MayorRev> GET SOME
[3:50:22] <@Solidus_113> Heckbane's voice sounds really familiar, but I can't place it
[3:50:23] <+HarleySilverWolf> heckbane feels like a big WTA refrence
[3:50:29] <@Solidus_113> there's no VA credits on the site either
[3:50:30] <%Superbro64> much like those "inpsired by windjammers" games, these titles live and die by capcom not releasing powerstone on modern platforms
[3:50:33] <%StaceMcGate> I'm 90% Heckbane is Antfish
[3:50:42] <%StaceMcGate> trying to imdb it
[3:50:48] <Dragon_Batman> Shame there is no voice credits
[3:50:57] <MayorRev> haha! one!
[3:50:58] <%Superbro64> I wonder what happened to combat core

[4:34:28] <%Irridium> trading card game
[4:34:29] <autcetera> Trading
[4:34:29] <@Solidus_113> Trading Card Game
[4:34:41] <%Binary_Fireball> @WoolieVersus play mtg sometime

[4:34:51] <chronoxgp> i mean ew
[4:34:52] <Dragon_Batman> Teppen is dope, You gonna check out Zero when he is out?
[4:34:53] <%SirGO0SE> card board crack
[4:34:54] <chronoxgp> lol
[4:34:58] <dohrge> what format should they play
[4:35:03] <arkv01> everyone snorts from the pack
[4:35:10] <%SirGO0SE> ive played mtg for 20 years lol
[4:35:28] <%SirGO0SE> i wish i was addicted to heroin itd be cheaper
[4:35:41] <%Binary_Fireball> shit's like a complicated fighting game
[4:35:51] <+cvp5127> as she should
[4:35:51] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:36:00] <%Binary_Fireball> like death poker
[4:36:04] <Dragon_Batman> My friends play from time MTG from time to time, I used to take care of tourneys when I worked at a comic sho
[4:36:08] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I've tried Magic and have played a little bit of Yugioh with friends, but ultimately not a genre I'm super into
[4:36:09] <Dragon_Batman> shop*
[4:36:18] <Dragon_Batman> Never pulled me in tho
[4:36:21] <+arcielardor> Wait, you're comparing heroin to fighting games @Binary_Fireball ?
[4:36:25] <chronoxgp> fighting trying not to show kamiya my e heross collection
[4:36:28] <%SirGO0SE> its one of the best games ever created. you can literally build a computer out of MTG card mechanics. its thourough
[4:36:36] <%SirGO0SE> thorough
[4:36:38] <%Binary_Fireball> I am comparing everything to heroin @arcielardor
[4:36:45] <Dragon_Batman> Pay to get in
[4:36:57] <%SirGO0SE> $300 buy in that becomes out dated in 6 months
[4:37:02] <%SirGO0SE> yeah
[4:37:14] <Dragon_Batman> Swtiching up sets every so often
[4:37:38] <Valentinius_Anodyne> That's why YGOPro is the only way to play that game B)
[4:37:39] <+eanscrale> TCGs were the gacha of their time
[4:37:41] <%Binary_Fireball> Ascension is a dope deck building game
[4:37:43] <+OUTheTeam> yugioh doesn't rotate cards out so you can use everything since the start that isnt banned
[4:37:45] <Clausible_Pause> Legends of Runeterra is a pretty decent TCG right now and it's monetization is probably the best I've ever seen for a TCG.
[4:38:12] <chronoxgp> i l;ay ygo pro 2 on deskto[p only way to play
[4:38:22] <%SirGO0SE> yeah they really were the gacha, but unless youre giving cards out for free, how do you keep updating the game for 20 yrs like wizards has
[4:38:28] <GarbageNirvana> Woolie would probably be into stuff like Marvel Dice
[4:38:34] <%Binary_Fireball> draft limits that but it's then pay to play
[4:38:35] <chronoxgp> has master rule 5 already
[4:38:39] <+eanscrale> THE SCALPERS
[4:38:43] <@Solidus_113> scum
[4:38:49] <+arcielardor> So are we seeing the birth of a new show, CardLords?
[4:38:53] <arkv01> schum
[4:39:08] <%Binary_Fireball> mtg is still really big
[4:39:10] <+cvp5127> Kappa
[4:39:15] <arkv01> fate big titties
[4:39:19] <@Solidus_113> Call the show Duel Masters woolieREMEMBERS
[4:39:19] <SuperKirby24> trading card lords Kappa
[4:39:21] <+OUTheTeam> yugioh is actually getting bigger than ever
[4:39:22] <%SirGO0SE> its only grown every year since its come out iirc
[4:39:22] <heartlesshealer> !
[4:39:34] <SuperKirby24> oh god that yugioh sevens art Kappa
[4:39:38] <G03933> Magic if anything has gotten worse cost wise tbh, although mostly hasnt changed
[4:39:38] <GarbageNirvana> See that I could probably get into
[4:39:55] <chronoxgp> have those kaijus mecha's too
[4:40:01] <Dragon_Batman> LUL gotta love Japanese names for stuff
[4:40:14] <chronoxgp> there's a reindeer one now
[4:40:15] <%SirGO0SE> @G03933 the only thing i like about current mtg cost is that the other formats are holding their value better
[4:40:19] <heartlesshealer> beware of power creep though if you get competitive
[4:40:31] <%Binary_Fireball> the world needs more mecha fighting games
[4:40:46] <yamikami13> @WoolieVersus hello hello mr Emerald Wasabi.
[4:40:46] <+zetaplus> the kamen rider deck literally does form changing
[4:40:49] <%Wool> bye

[4:42:03] <SuperKirby24> Couldnt catch the arms part, but thanks for the stream @WoolieVersus
[4:42:04] <+zetaplus> @OnlyNumber1 yes using a lot of quick play spell cards. they can form change during battle phase so you can keep attacking or activate effects after form change
[4:42:07] <@Solidus_113> VODs are already exclusive for the podcast streams
[4:42:09] <%SirGO0SE> i have a 2nd twitch account for the podcast subs lol
[4:42:38] <heartlesshealer> twitch vods treated as podcast and youtube vids for watching the gameplay since we don't get the talkies is how I do it
[4:42:44] <+zetaplus> @OnlyNumber1 oh sorry I meant yugioh
[4:43:13] <%SirGO0SE> Woolie what about the ads on VODs?

[4:51:29] <SuperKirby24> was project x zone good? I never played it
[4:51:40] <animailistic> no
[4:51:45] <%SirGO0SE> maybe ill check it out since im doing laps on fe3h
[4:51:47] <GarbageNirvana> Folks like it in a Super Robot Wars kinda way I think

[0:02:48] <@Menitta> tomorrow
[0:02:56] <Ghostbody> Podcast is Wednesday
[0:02:59] <Picia000123> ok, thanks for info
[0:03:08] <abelincoln_catpuncher> I'm sick and feel like shit but watching the Wools helps(:
[0:03:15] <+ReppukenAllDay> Wools is the dude.
[0:03:21] <@Menitta> I'm procrastinating at work
[0:03:29] <Captain_Joe1911> Hope you feel better soon @abelincoln_catpuncher BloodTrail
[0:03:57] <+gustavozxd> so yesterday i was watching a streamer play dmc5 as their first game and man, they absolutely expect you to have played at least 3 in that game like damn
[0:04:06] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @captain_joe1911 thanks dude
[0:04:32] <+gustavozxd> Dante in 5 has too much shit right away to learn for the first time lol
[0:04:51] <rosetherosiest> idk i started with dmc5 and i was just fine honestly? but i had played bayonetta beforehand
[0:05:26] <+gustavozxd> yeah I guess if you're used to the genre a bit
[0:06:00] <+enickma11> @gustavozxd True, but once you get it down its a blast getting that execution down
[0:06:00] <rosetherosiest> that said i could have also been playing badly and just not noticing
[0:06:08] <+benial17> Evening gamers
[0:06:10] <abelincoln_catpuncher> honestly DMC5 dante was way easier to get into, at least for me. DMC4 Dantes skill floor is pretty high, and DMC3 was way harder for me than DMC5
[0:06:11] <+enickma11> Quad S makes my pee pee real hard
[0:06:31] <%KoyFoster> Lapis no
[0:06:31] <Ghostbody> ^this

[0:13:44] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Ah figured
[0:13:45] <vexotheclown> The beginning of the last decade was just everyone crawling out of bunkers and safe houses to discover that the Y2K Bug hadn't ended the world.
[0:13:47] <Guardiansaiyan> CurseLit 20's CurseLit
[0:13:49] <Enemy_In_Disguise> WW3 or Civil War 2. One’s gotta happen

[0:30:25] <+ActionWords> Engineer here: that sort of behavior really depends on the industry you're talking about. If you mean the changes we saw from the 90s to now in like technology hardware and stuff, the industry is maturing. The software space, big data manipulation, decentralization of entertainment and ... things, is still coming along. In a lot of ways, it's just industries maturing
[0:30:27] <EndgameContent> It's likely not gonna stop until we get oil lobbyists out of government and stop subsidizing their failing industry.

[0:32:54] <+ActionWords> but generally, if you look at where the universities are researching in, *some* of those may actually be the future, but generally indicative of where the industry is *generally* going

[0:37:13] <SomersaultJustice> part 5 sucks
[0:37:13] <%igodex13> that's fair
[0:37:13] <+gustavozxd> it's almost no one's
[0:37:14] <$rytyoung> it's not my fave, but I do like it a lot
[0:37:16] <KeiPrime> he's right
[0:37:16] <+TopTieramisu> giorno's the weakest jojo
[0:37:18] <+Polter_ge1st> huh
[0:37:18] <$KaizenChaos> woolieSHOOK
[0:37:21] <%KoyFoster> That's how I feel about 4.
[0:37:22] <+TopTieramisu> with the strongest stand
[0:37:23] <%igodex13> Mista though
[0:37:24] <badmr7> good, but the least favorite
[0:37:29] <assfordayz> Still good, just not the ebst
[0:37:29] <@Solidus_113> It's not the best JoJo, but it's still a decent anime
[0:37:37] <+Polter_ge1st> Giorno is the weakest JoJo imo
[0:37:43] <+TopTieramisu> yes
[0:37:45] <0cash> thats what i feel about Jojo in general kinda
[0:37:45] <%gatorafan> You are alright Reggie, but Japan hates you now Kappa
[0:37:46] <%Chatterbox1991> Woolie dying inside
[0:37:48] <JDebss> Agreed
[0:37:53] <%Swedish_Expert> same
[0:37:59] <Ilkim61> it's so we can better be hyped for part 6
[0:38:01] <+JingKaisean> the ending falls flat
[0:38:09] <%Swedish_Expert> the last fight is so bad
[0:38:09] <+gustavozxd> Reggie gonna give up on JoJo in part 6
[0:38:13] <+invisiblessedreptile> All JoJo parts up to now are way better than pretty much any anime airing right now
[0:38:15] <+ggbhtg> I've struggled to finish it, I don't like the crew...
[0:38:21] <+UnderageBat> LMAO
[0:38:21] <Angry_Ev1L> LUL
[0:38:23] <+gustavozxd> LUL
[0:38:24] <+TopTieramisu> part 5 is japan's favorite

[0:38:34] <%igodex13> woolieSMUG woolieSMUG woolieSMUG
[0:38:35] <$KaizenChaos> Really?!
[0:38:37] <%Mtome> 6 is the worst my good friend
[0:38:37] <$rytyoung> 3 IS THE SHIT
[0:38:37] <TueDuffCity> What about part 1 man?????
[0:38:38] <+TopTieramisu> 3 is the worst
[0:38:39] <%Swedish_Expert> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[0:38:40] <Mucmaster> Part 5 is Japan's favourite though
[0:38:41] <+gustavozxd> hmm idk
[0:38:41] <Enemy_In_Disguise> He’s right tho
[0:38:41] <+DesertPenguin> Is there one single JoJo series to watch if I want to catch up to this nonsense?
[0:38:43] <assfordayz> They give it the BEST OST tho
[0:38:44] <%KoyFoster> Everyone says Part 1 is the worst. But I love part 1.
[0:38:46] <+DesertPenguin> I thought they weere reading the manga
[0:38:47] <+TopTieramisu> 3 ends well but it's wayy too long
[0:38:49] <$KaizenChaos> woolieVERGIN
[0:38:51] <anAngryHamster> Bad JoJo is still good anime
[0:38:55] <+Javaa01> But the hill REALLY starts climbing at 7
[0:38:56] <thewoolieholeofdavidcage> i'm not even a jojo fan and even i know part5 is bad
[0:38:57] <FacetiousAF> even part 8?
[0:38:57] <%gatorafan> 5 and 6 are the contention points.
[0:38:59] <Alseid> 1 and 2 are easily worse than 5
[0:39:01] <TueDuffCity> What about part 1 man?
[0:39:02] <JDebss> I honestly ONLY like part 4 from 1-5
[0:39:07] <+gustavozxd> man idk between 3 5 and 6
[0:39:13] <0cash> 6 is the only one im somewhat hyped because Jolyne
[0:39:13] <@Solidus_113> Get your chalk, get your climbing gear, and start on that cliff. Part 6 is coming
[0:39:19] <Mucmaster> 5>2>4>3=1
[0:39:29] <%KoyFoster> Part 4 got a shitty anime adaptation.
[0:39:31] <CasualCthullu> welcome to the club
[0:39:33] <+JingKaisean> bucciarati might be one of the best characters in jojo
[0:39:36] <+TopTieramisu> jotaro is so overrated
[0:39:38] <jeagon10> hey how is everyone doing
[0:39:38] <+JingKaisean> but part 5 is meh
[0:39:46] <%Swedish_Expert> 7=4>>>3>6>1>5
[0:39:51] <+gustavozxd> 5 has some of my favorite fights
[0:39:56] <+ggbhtg> IF YALL MOTHERFUCKERS DONT GET KIRA BUCKLAND TO BE JOLYNE jojo is CANCELLED
[0:40:01] <+TopTieramisu> peak of part 5 imo is white album fight
[0:40:05] <0cash> 5 has better pacing than part 4 at least
[0:40:06] <+ggbhtg> dead ASS
[0:40:07] <Prevot> so far I still enjoyed part 2 the most
[0:40:10] <%KoyFoster> Part 5 is straight forward.
[0:40:11] <%gatorafan> yeah 4 got done dirty. It's one of my favorites FeelsBadMan
[0:40:34] <%Chatterbox1991> HEY WING IS AMAZING
[0:40:41] <+ggbhtg> Japan looooves CLAMP
[0:40:44] <+Matt_Made> I like gundam wing tho?
[0:40:46] <+DiabloDeAzul> it's only not as interesting because its treated as a spinoff. If Jojo was rewritten with 5 in mind it could've been much better
[0:40:55] <+TopTieramisu> giorno isn't ANYTHING like jonathan or dio
[0:40:56] <+gustavozxd> I WANT to say 6 is the worst but there's a lot I like about it, same goes for 5, 3 though... hmm
[0:40:58] <JDebss> Nothing
[0:40:59] <HolisticField> 1>2>4>5>3
[0:41:01] <xeros720> 5 really does have high point fights, but i think other parts are stronger
[0:41:02] <KeiPrime> wing is cool but the hero suits are so damn powerful, its kinda boring
[0:41:12] <+TopTieramisu> the son of two charismatic fathers has absolutely no presence
[0:41:17] <KeiPrime> a leo is not on the level of a zaku u know what i mean
[0:41:25] <Ilkim61> part 5 could have been about closing off the whole vampires/pillar men thing
[0:41:26] <+DiabloDeAzul> 5>3>2>1>4
[0:41:31] <@Solidus_113> 44 seconds?
[0:41:32] <%igodex13> 7
[0:41:34] <+gustavozxd> 30 seconds/7 pages
[0:41:35] <%Swedish_Expert> 7?
[0:41:41] <%KoyFoster> Ah man. I'm ganna have to watch that real quick.
[0:41:49] <JDebss> 4>3>1>2>5 for me
[0:42:19] <+ggbhtg> But it doesn't carry the entire part, sadly
[0:42:21] <+TopTieramisu> 3 is the most overrated
[0:42:26] <HolisticField> 3 was wayyy to monotonous for wayyy to long, got sick of the same formulat copy pasted over and over again
[0:42:29] <+gustavozxd> and about 30 seconds in the anime
[0:42:30] <+ggbhtg> An ENTIRE CHAPTER
[0:42:36] <KeiPrime> an entire volume?!
[0:42:39] <+TopTieramisu> 3 was carried by dio
[0:42:41] <+gustavozxd> 3 has the worst villains
[0:42:43] <+ggbhtg> A WHOLE VOLUME??????
[0:42:45] <Prevot> second half of part 3 is great, but the first half is kinda weak
[0:42:53] <0cash> true
[0:42:59] <JDebss> sudden evil would have been fun
[0:43:08] <+JingKaisean> bullshit, part 3 has j geil, poop baby, dsrbies, and a fucking gorilla
[0:43:09] <KeiPrime> tbf you could do a whole volume of diavolo dying, and it would fit in the story
[0:43:16] <anAngryHamster> Preach!
[0:43:17] <+JingKaisean> part 3 has great villains
[0:43:18] <+DiabloDeAzul> the only good part of 4 was kira, power of friendship is bs
[0:43:22] <@Solidus_113> Gangstar
[0:43:26] <$rytyoung> BRUNO MY BOY
[0:43:32] <+ggbhtg> Part 5 is West Side Story Disc B
[0:43:35] <+bread_assassin> Bruno's more interesting then most Jojos.
[0:43:41] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Bruno’s Bizarre Adventure
[0:43:41] <KeiPrime> fugo too strong, araki had to write him out
[0:43:42] <0cash> Bruno is a cool character
[0:43:47] <0cash> really cool stand too
[0:43:53] <+gustavozxd> like the part 3 Capcom game is cool but I don't care about almost 2 thirds of that roster
[0:43:54] <+TopTieramisu> kars was a threat to humanity
[0:43:56] <+primax104> glad I tuned in for the JoJo discussion :D
[0:43:57] <@Menitta> Giorno is to Dio as what Jake is to Albert Wesker
[0:44:00] <%Swedish_Expert> Kars saved that dog tho FeelsBadMan
[0:44:03] <Mucmaster> Kars was gonna take over the world!
[0:44:06] <xeros720> cars kind of deserved it
[0:44:08] <%gatorafan> Hey! Angelo!
[0:44:20] <%igodex13> Yo
[0:44:20] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1210124488463077376
[0:44:22] <+TopTieramisu> kars also genocided his own race
[0:44:23] <+jiggy_snipe> Kars might eventually land somewhere
[0:44:24] <+ggbhtg> Fugo was gonna be a traitor too, that's more to why he was written out
[0:44:29] <JDebss> That woman from Jurassic world > Kars
[0:44:29] <+gustavozxd> KARS SAVED A PUPPY
[0:44:34] <Ether101_Prime> Ganon got it harder then Kars as its never implied he died after TWW.
[0:44:42] <Prevot> diavolo's shadow looked cool, but his actual appearance was lame
[0:44:43] <+TopTieramisu> he should have been giorgio
[0:44:45] <+gustavozxd> Trish is super lame too
[0:44:52] <+Javaa01> Yeah, Part 5 has a lot of writing foibles
[0:44:52] <KeiPrime> fugo fightin the crew could have been cool
[0:44:54] <Alseid> diabolo means devil
[0:45:01] <HolisticField> i was sad to see fugo get shoved aside for the rest of the season, was really hoping for him to return somehow
[0:45:01] <+BallerSwagBro9k> WE BACK BOIS
[0:45:14] <@Solidus_113> The Metallica Fight is still one of my personal favourites over most of the series
[0:45:15] <+JingKaisean> remember koichi was in part 5?me neither
[0:45:17] <%KoyFoster> Seeing Polnareff was hype.
[0:45:18] <+TopTieramisu> and by "people" you mean araki
[0:45:27] <0cash> Not just the people. Araki forgets
[0:45:27] <KeiPrime> araki sets up a lot of shit that he forgets to play off on like the guy who saved josuke
[0:45:27] <+gustavozxd> I was interested in fugo at first but he got shoved to the side so hard
[0:45:30] <Prevot> what DOESN'T araki forget
[0:45:31] <+DiabloDeAzul> Diavolo wasn't written to have an arc, but he's written consistently
[0:45:31] <%EpsilonDSC> I'm enjoying this jojo podcast
[0:45:31] <verdantgeo> oh gosh how long has the stream been going for?

[0:51:25] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:51:27] <@Solidus_113> I really wish Sleeping Slaves was the 1st or 2nd episode
[0:51:32] <+DiabloDeAzul> Reminder that Diavolo set up the gang in which all of the Golden Wind met, the power of friendship was only possible due to the villain
[0:51:37] <$rytyoung> how is he even alive?!
[0:51:41] <+BallerSwagBro9k> The Gay Mafia LUL
[0:51:48] <TopTieramisu> @rytyoung bs gold experience powers

[0:52:05] <+Javaa01> Speaking of the most Araki thing, that 2020 Paraolympics poster artwork
[0:52:07] <$rytyoung> @toptieramisu everyone has the healing factor!
[0:52:08] <+ClaudeMcGarren> @rytyoung Giorno kept healing him
[0:52:09] <@Solidus_113> Araki loves his twinks
[0:52:12] <%gatorafan> Has Reggie watched the Rohan OVAs? He could check those
[0:52:12] <anAngryHamster> Hey Woolie, when's the last podcast gonna be uploaded to the site?
[0:52:18] <itesket> Twinks Kreygasm
[0:52:22] <%jepupu> In Araki's Italy everyone -really- could be a stand user.
[0:52:28] <$rytyoung> ooh Araki's Olympics are is amazing
[0:52:34] <$rytyoung> art ffs
[0:52:42] <rosetherosiest> apparently they're gonna be adding extra stuff to dmc3 on the switch?
[0:52:45] <+TopTieramisu> giorno's powers are more nonsense than king crimson
[0:52:53] <+TopTieramisu> even before requiem
[0:52:57] <depressedpepega> Joe Rogan shows up PogChamp
[0:52:57] <+ActionWords> question - is Araki's art like part of the official Olympics art or something? How does that work?
[0:53:00] <%Swedish_Expert> guess i'll die
[0:53:06] <+bread_assassin> Remember Jotaro nearly got killed by a rat,
[0:53:07] <+ActionWords> or did he just like draw it cause the Olympics are on?
[0:53:08] <%Swedish_Expert> an infinite amount of times
[0:53:08] <+gustavozxd> the fact that he says "star platinum the world" though LUL
[0:53:14] <KeiPrime> two rats
[0:53:17] <+DiabloDeAzul> If Diavolo could be beaten, every stand could be beaten
[0:53:19] <Ether101_Prime> Link has complete control of time space but nobody ever ask that question.
[0:53:19] <+gustavozxd> like he doesn't need to say it at all BUT IT'S COOL THO
[0:53:20] <IamGreven> doesnt the stand take control of giorno
[0:53:21] <$rytyoung> @actionwords he made the art for the Olympics and it's officially endorsed
[0:53:30] <%EpsilonDSC> you're feeling are always valued
[0:53:36] <Graxe_> Nullification of action, which against Diavolo ended up in a time loop of death
[0:53:38] <+RPG_CHICAGO> Did Woolz previously say what happened to podcast...?
[0:53:39] <+ActionWords> @rytyoung PogChamp nice! I saw it the other day and it looks dope

[0:54:00] <Prevot> just pick a top tier part
[0:54:01] <Graxe_> If Giorno wants you dead, he can also put you in a time loop of death
[0:54:02] <$rytyoung> @actionwords it's crazy how much of an icon he is;
[0:54:07] <+RPG_CHICAGO> Gotcha, thanks @TopTieramisu

[1:07:12] <+benial17> perhaps you unlock her for doing all the sidequests?
[1:07:19] <anAngryHamster> Maybe it was meant for one of the 7 cut characters
[1:07:25] <@Solidus_113> Shovel Knight is probably hiding up there
[1:07:41] <%gatorafan> Woolie should do an Hades stream, I think he only played the first versions on the Epic Store
[1:07:51] <+TopTieramisu> hades is a great game
[1:08:50] <+Matt_Made> Hades has gotten alot of love

[1:19:08] <BloodiaMK2> Hmmm
[1:19:08] <anAngryHamster> eh, ship it. We're out of money
[1:19:10] <%gatorafan> Woolie is so cool, handicapping himself to make it more of a fight Kappa

[1:20:53] <%gatorafan> yeyeye
[1:20:59] <+ActionWords> bemvrSad i'm not crying
[1:21:00] <rosetherosiest> this game would be better with less characters but more story for each
[1:21:02] <%gatorafan> Woolie is super right
[1:21:04] <BloodiaMK2> Woolie is right, I wish she has more of these
[1:21:09] <BloodiaMK2> had*
[1:21:21] <BloodiaMK2> She's voiced by Stephanie Sheh, so she's perfect
[1:21:28] <%gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Woolie wants the slob goth waifu

[1:22:32] <HolisticField> they didnt really deliver what they promised in the kickstarter imo
[1:22:42] <Prevot> she's become that trope with a SBFP quote on tvtropes
[1:22:59] <+TopTieramisu> what did they promise?
[1:23:25] <HolisticField> for one they said each character would get iddhi attacks
[1:23:34] <Mantorok06> BlessRNG
[1:24:08] <+Capta1n_H3nry> The kickstarter (or whatever platform, maybe IndieGoGo?) said that they were gonna have a beastiary and a blacksmith, along with a lot of other stuff
[1:24:11] <@Solidus_113> Back to Ashwat, but climb the mountain first
[1:24:49] <thunderhog> Thorani and Doggo can be backtracked too before too long
[1:24:52] <nilathoa> on one hand the interactions are single poses and there's no voice acting so adding more scenes wouldn't cost much
[1:24:58] <nilathoa> on the other hand indie games are carried by their tone and the more you write the easier it is to mess it up
[1:25:04] <%jinking79> back to the Village
[1:25:15] <@Menitta> Idk why but whenever I look at this game I think about Pokemon Ranger

[1:50:38] <%KoyFoster> @Hasmeister96 He's still looking for arrow dudes quests thing and then he's heading back.
[1:50:40] <Vortigon> BibleThump
[1:50:45] <hassanico2> Wait
[1:50:49] <+the_createy> is there any points of no return?
[1:50:56] <Prevot> quick get the purse
[1:50:57] <%KoyFoster> @the_createy Nope
[1:51:00] <hassanico2> yyou're telling he has to climb the mountain a 4th fucking time?!
[1:51:00] <faeron93> Woolie stop dying
[1:51:02] <+Hasmeister96> @KoyFoster Thanks
[1:51:14] <@Solidus_113> every time you go through something, the dash resets
[1:51:27] <BearSawed> Oh no its Dav'ed Kage, The expert on ze bad games
[1:51:35] <@Solidus_113> that yellow ring is the signifies is
[1:51:42] <@Solidus_113> it*
[1:52:03] <Vortigon> do combo
[1:52:35] <HolisticField> show us woolie
[1:52:58] <@Solidus_113> go from underneath
[1:53:06] <hassanico2> How does keep end up doing the downward axe move when trying to go up?
[1:53:20] <@Solidus_113> the down attack happens when you don't have other options
[1:53:28] <@Solidus_113> it's the default
[1:53:29] <hassanico2> Ah, thanks
[1:53:58] <SomersaultJustice> just be perfect
[1:54:04] <%KoyFoster> Lol
[1:54:05] <SomersaultJustice> see
[1:54:07] <Vortigon> peperoni secret
[1:54:13] <@Solidus_113> it's a ringsel
[1:54:16] <%KoyFoster> There was a path
[1:54:28] <HolisticField> seemed empty to me
[1:54:32] <%KoyFoster> Oh well
[1:54:43] <ShinMaddrox> There was clearly a path there woolie
[1:55:05] <%KoyFoster> There was a path that leads up. Not sure where it goes.
[1:55:20] <+jiggy_snipe> Wookie should check again
[1:55:25] <BearSawed> God this is reminding me why I hate hate jumping puzzles in almost everything
[1:55:35] <+PapaGravestone> it was just a path back to somewhere already explored its fine ratirlMad
[1:56:51] <%gatorafan> these are some creepy monsters
[1:56:51] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:57:05] <%gatorafan> maybe the art style learns the horror a bit
[1:57:05] <EndgameContent> You just gotta know the frame data, Wools
[1:57:17] <%gatorafan> *lessens
[1:57:31] <EndgameContent> "I'm getting way too small." -Woolie "Darlington" Madden
[1:58:23] <hentaimancometh> Nothing wastes more time
[1:58:28] <BearSawed> Woolie blink 3 times slowly if Reggie is making you play this, Like are you okay buddy?
[1:59:03] <hassanico2> @BearSawed it's probably just the tiredness from flying around
[1:59:16] <hassanico2> Like he just got back to Canada today right?
[1:59:29] <%gatorafan> Yeah I didn't expect a stream today
[1:59:33] <Medo3G> I assume the ringsel room had a shortcut
[1:59:40] <EndgameContent> Do the platforming, Woolie
[1:59:42] <KuroKartoonist> he's already stuck in his genjustsu it won't work @BearSawed
[1:59:43] <BearSawed> i mean youre right, but I enjoy the idea of Reggie making him lp
[2:00:09] <hassanico2> Hmmm gosh Woolie, bad game design at the endgame with 0 shortcuts? I wonder...
[2:00:31] <hassanico2> But seriously making you climb this mountain over and over is so awful
[2:00:31] <%KoyFoster> Shortcuts are getting skipped.
[2:00:36] <EndgameContent> I feel like you're missing shortcuts
[2:00:39] <@Solidus_113> the change is that you have all these new mobility options to use
[2:00:44] <hassanico2> He did find the spider shortcuts
[2:00:56] <hassanico2> But thre's still SOOOO much to do is wht it feels like
[2:00:58] <%KoyFoster> Here's one.
[2:01:32] <+PapaGravestone> for some reason i read sphincter shortcuts instead od spider
[2:01:35] <+PapaGravestone> hmmm
[2:01:43] <hassanico2> There's like a corkscrew corridor there
[2:02:01] <hassanico2> Probably just a Ringsel
[2:02:06] <%KoyFoster> You'll be back. You can do it next time.
[2:02:14] <hassanico2> Yeah it's just a tiny room looks like
[2:02:25] <BearSawed> Wait hell have to do this....again?
[2:02:38] <hassanico2> Yeah guess what, there's some sidequest resolution up here
[2:02:39] <+Grayhammatter> prolly that whole area with the air dashes
[2:02:44] <%KoyFoster> That probably led to that.
[2:02:47] <hassanico2> Meaning he has to climb all the way up, then down, then back up
[2:02:51] <@Solidus_113> Reggie is right
[2:03:16] <BearSawed> MIKE Z!!!!!!!!!!
[2:03:25] <Ilkim61> Reggie and Woolie. Their initials stand for Right and Wrong. It was so obvious.
[2:03:27] <@Solidus_113> sick
[2:03:28] <BearSawed> Por Que?
[2:03:29] <Medo3G> is it gonna glitch?
[2:03:31] <hassanico2> When do we get to beat up MikeZ in game
[2:03:35] <@Solidus_113> SWING FIRST
[2:04:20] <hassanico2> No combo for you, only BIG NUMBER
[2:04:20] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1210124488463077376
[2:04:33] <Picia000123> Top 5 tho, right
[2:04:54] <BearSawed> Dont use the incantation, you might summon pat
[2:05:12] <@Solidus_113> oh wow the UI is falling apart
[2:05:33] <%gatorafan> I'm sure Pat is too busy choking on Elmo hair right now
[2:05:55] <EndgameContent> It's like Hollow Knight
[2:06:00] <Picia000123> only sdhittier
[2:06:00] <@Solidus_113> your regular dash goes directly up too
[2:06:06] <EndgameContent> You gotta do a really hard platforming thing followed by a hard fight
[2:06:29] <@Solidus_113> almost there
[2:06:35] <hassanico2> Something about this game is starting to remind me about Compile Heart RPG's gameplay loops
[2:06:38] <+QueequegTheater> It's like Hollow Knight if Hollow Knight's platforming and cobat both sucked
[2:06:38] <+gustavozxd> i enjoyed the difficult platforming at the end of Hollow Knight though
[2:06:51] <EndgameContent> Queequeg I'll bury you
[2:06:53] <+QueequegTheater> *combat
[2:07:02] <%ozzrabbit> Isn’t he getting dangerously close to Kala?
[2:07:09] <crimson_force> yep
[2:07:13] <hassanico2> IIRC there's a warning
[2:07:16] <Picia000123> Man, trying to do everything at once with no budget must suck ass
[2:07:20] <+QueequegTheater> @EndgameContent I can't hear you over all this generic turn-based, skill-less, mash x to win combat
[2:07:25] <@Solidus_113> the hands
[2:07:26] <marvel877> You get nothing for styling like that.
[2:07:27] <hassanico2> And you get one last platforming ability before the actual final boss fight
[2:07:29] <@Solidus_113> mashing triangle
[2:07:50] <+PapaGravestone> at least the other enemy turned into a ball so it looked like a dunk
[2:08:06] <crimson_force> mashing triangle but it consumes iddhi
[2:08:07] <+QueequegTheater> Mash triangle to win, like all great fighting games Kappa
[2:08:15] <@Solidus_113> now we new stuff
[2:08:27] <hassanico2> How long is this bit Solidus?
[2:08:30] <EndgameContent> @QueeQuegTheater Woolie getting big enough to trivialize fights doesn't make the combat system boring, go kick sand
[2:08:33] <hassanico2> Or rather how torturous
[2:08:37] <HolisticField> mash triangle except instead of the triangle its my clt
[2:08:41] <+gustavozxd> so noctis in Tekken? KappaHD
[2:08:44] <Picia000123> This game could really be better if you got rid of like HALF of it
[2:08:46] <hassanico2> @EndgameContent it's not Woolie's fault, the game is balanced bad
[2:08:48] <+QueequegTheater> @EndgameContent Yes it literally does.
[2:08:49] <%KoyFoster> Are we past Zebei's quest objective? I think we are, actually.
[2:08:53] <@Solidus_113> I don't even know, I spent a lot of time on the secret boss
[2:08:57] <Picia000123> and improve on that
[2:08:58] <@Solidus_113> maybe 40 minutes?
[2:09:03] <marvel877> @Picia000123 maybe more like 3/4 of it.
[2:09:12] <EndgameContent> @Hassanico2 Unfortunately so, but at least that's the first thing they're fixing.
[2:09:16] <hassanico2> FRAMERATE
[2:09:28] <+Cobaltor_252> this movement and platforming looks like a barebones Guacamelee
[2:09:30] <hassanico2> Oh no wait the graphical effect is just bad LUL
[2:09:35] <hassanico2> the framerate's actually fine
[2:09:49] <%ozzrabbit> He didn’t miss the side quests, did he?
[2:09:55] <marvel877> no
[2:10:04] <EndgameContent> @ozzrabbit If he hasn't done all of them, he's done most of them
[2:10:14] <@Solidus_113> get used to thing song
[2:10:25] <+QueequegTheater> WHAT GREAT COMBAT LUL
[2:10:30] <+Grayhammatter> the hell is THAT?
[2:10:31] <+gustavozxd> so I'm wonder what Woolie has left on his list of games to play after this
[2:10:32] <Picia000123> I actually don't want to comment, because everything comes down to negative criticism LUL
[2:10:35] <hassanico2> What is Kala's obsession with stupid spiked balls?
[2:10:40] <+benial17> what the hell did I miss
[2:10:42] <EndgameContent> @QueequegTheater Why are you here?
[2:10:44] <Picia000123> Like, I don't know what to say
[2:10:47] <thunderhog> Kalla loves balls apparently
[2:10:50] <Picia000123> It looks pretty
[2:10:52] <EndgameContent> @QueequegTheater Go do something you enjoy.
[2:10:52] <+QueequegTheater> @EndgameContent Because I like Woolie
[2:10:53] <marvel877> @Picia000123 same, and I platinumed this game.
[2:11:01] <BearSawed> Jobbed so hard
[2:11:13] <hassanico2> This final area music sounds like bad party music at times
[2:11:37] <%KoyFoster> Wow. We are super close to the end. Well this will make back tracking easier. Lol
[2:11:37] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:11:51] <+gustavozxd> @hassanico2 yeah it got super loud a bit ago
[2:12:38] <+gustavozxd> it sounds like it's trying to be like the Ys ost
[2:12:39] <thunderhog> @WoolieVersus The other way you had was a tranition area to an old zone
[2:12:39] <+Grayhammatter> how about both?
[2:12:48] <hassanico2> @gustavozxd nice comparison
[2:12:48] <thunderhog> So world linking
[2:12:56] <Picia000123> All it lacks is some Lotus Juice knock off
[2:13:08] <+QueequegTheater> Woolie Will Figure It Out
[2:13:16] <thunderhog> There are no Halls to Wug
[2:13:16] <hassanico2> The pink bit is a teleporter isn't it?
[2:13:22] <DSD24> This is to go further beyond
[2:13:29] <haisho> time for MAXIMUM TRAVERSAL
[2:13:43] <+Declan_8000> If you fight Kala you still get a chance to go back
[2:13:54] <Picia000123> man, I really need to buy Super Meatboy
[2:13:56] <marvel877> there's nothing left worth looking for.
[2:13:56] <crimson_force> he didn't unlocked the last form
[2:14:01] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus check your map around the bottom of this section, I think the secret boss is back at the start. I could send you the screenshot on twitter
[2:14:04] <+VulcanSpear> this music is kinda OD
[2:14:16] <Picia000123> it's a'ight
[2:14:27] <marvel877> Yes, its progress.
[2:14:29] <hassanico2> @Solidus_113 can he beat that thing?
[2:14:32] <%KoyFoster> Up is progress
[2:14:44] <@Solidus_113> nope, but it'll be good to at least show him the map location
[2:15:12] <+Grayhammatter> this seems like maximum progress
[2:15:19] <SleepyMaribo> yeah this area goes on and wears out its welcome at this point.
[2:15:24] <hassanico2> INVISIBLE WALLS WOOO
[2:15:42] <marvel877> arguably the game wore out its welcome 20 hours ago.
[2:15:50] <thunderhog> Actually Im not sure if he can do that thing now
[2:15:50] <+QueequegTheater> LUL
[2:15:53] <haisho> behold UROBOROS
[2:15:53] <hassanico2> LUL

[2:16:31] <+Parrish_broadnax> We do not want the smoke
[2:16:35] <Picia000123> Don't worry Woolie, You're automatically healed, so it doesn't matter LUL
[2:16:40] <marvel877> unless of course Pat messes up his sleep schedule again.
[2:16:46] <hassanico2> Not sleep, flights
[2:16:56] <hassanico2> I think Pat's still in the US?
[2:16:57] <ha2ken> Right right cool. Looking forward to hearing Pat's travel stories.
[2:17:04] <+Polter_ge1st> IDK if you want that smoke Woolie
[2:17:06] <DSD24> Ah man I got work tomorrow so I'll miss it
[2:17:09] <haisho> HUSTLE
[2:17:37] <Afterman_> dont fuck it up
[2:17:53] <marvel877> @hassanico2 no, he's back, but knowing him he'll stay up late doing random shit on a steam game and be the reason for a delay again.
[2:18:01] <TigerClaws12> bug him out
[2:18:07] <+VulcanSpear> no staggers monkaS
[2:18:09] <marvel877> this is a nothing "boss"
[2:18:21] <hassanico2> @marvel877 for sure, he's probably LoLing or Destiny 2ing it up
[2:18:24] <%KoyFoster> I see Woolie finishing this game today.
[2:18:39] <hassanico2> Nice Tungar levels
[2:18:39] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:18:40] <IamGreven> tungar at 69
[2:18:40] <+VulcanSpear> POWER OF THE NAGA
[2:18:42] <HolisticField> i see a little silhouetto of a man
[2:18:45] <IamGreven> NICE
[2:18:52] <DSD24> I miss Dhar
[2:18:54] <ha2ken> Two weeks without a podcast makes me nervous, and I'm almost caught up.
[2:18:56] <hassanico2> We all do
[2:18:57] <+TheRealMasterof7s> So they just gave up on finishing the side quests?
[2:19:02] <Solokaldaka> woopsHey chat
[2:19:06] <%KoyFoster> Pog
[2:19:08] <+VulcanSpear> F for Dhar FeelsBadMan
[2:19:09] <hassanico2> Apparently the last sidequest is somewhere in here LUL
[2:19:12] <DSD24> @Solokaldaka Hiya!
[2:19:35] <hassanico2> LUL funneling
[2:19:39] <haisho> and give up on more POWER?
[2:19:40] <CirclesForever> why can't metroid crawl
[2:20:02] <HolisticField> why crawl when u can roll
[2:20:08] <marvel877> Its all nothing.
[2:20:10] <%KoyFoster> It might not be nothing. <=0
[2:20:17] <SleepyMaribo> sadly the final boss is the worst thing about this game. cuz fighting games am i right?
[2:20:28] <hassanico2> @SleepyMaribo oh boy
[2:20:29] <+VulcanSpear> sounds like something from a mario & luigi game
[2:20:42] <+gustavozxd> it's a little too hyped up for a long platforming section
[2:20:47] <HolisticField> @SleepyMaribo it's like poetry. it rhymes
[2:20:53] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[2:20:53] <+QueequegTheater> yeyeyeye
[2:20:58] <@Solidus_113> just keep going
[2:20:59] <Picia000123> Woolie admits to murder
[2:21:06] <Picia000123> You heard it here first
[2:21:11] <aero160h> final boss has woolie's fave mechanic of every game. rg.
[2:21:19] <DSD24> @SleepyMaribo Wait it is?
[2:21:22] <hassanico2> @aero160h ...parrying?
[2:21:25] <CirclesForever> it's only murder if u get caught
[2:21:31] <hassanico2> Oh god this game had a parry mechanic
[2:21:33] <Haarute> i enjoyed the final boss.
[2:21:36] <hassanico2> I forgot that shit existed
[2:21:38] <SleepyMaribo> @HolisticField the final boss and ending upset me so bad, especially after i went thru the effort to 100% the game
[2:21:39] <marvel877> @aero160h just talk?
[2:21:44] <+Grayhammatter> naga rider PogChamp
[2:21:56] <@Solidus_113> totally untested
[2:21:56] <HolisticField> yeah its a big ball of wasted potential
[2:22:00] <+QueequegTheater> what great combat that allows itself to be cancelled mid-fight Kappa
[2:22:14] <DSD24> This is goofy
[2:22:28] <Picia000123> Yeah, the fact that you can just get knocked out of combat is ass
[2:22:40] <hassanico2> Please do not tell me we're gearing for something like "I forgive you Kala, you did nothing wrong, unlike Dhar"
[2:22:42] <Picia000123> Because terrain is not flat
[2:22:53] <+VulcanSpear> LOL
[2:22:55] <Haarute> HE'S FINE
[2:22:56] <marvel877> the boss was nothing and i think my game glitched because i heard no music whatsoever in the final cutscene, so it was all just long awkward silence.
[2:22:59] <Picia000123> @hassanico2 What do you fucking think?
[2:23:07] <marvel877> @hassanico2 uuhhhhhhh...
[2:23:12] <hassanico2> holy shit I guessed right didn't I
[2:23:13] <+QueequegTheater> @Picia000123 oh noooo
[2:23:15] <hassanico2> Fuuuuuuck me
[2:23:18] <DSD24> @Picia000123 Fuck that if that's true
[2:23:23] <marvel877> it is
[2:23:36] <+QueequegTheater> RIP
[2:23:45] <hassanico2> I am dying inside right now LUL
[2:23:45] <+VulcanSpear> ABSOLELUTELY NOTHING
[2:23:46] <+VulcanSpear> LMAO
[2:23:47] <+PapaGravestone> no shut up she never had friends
[2:23:48] <HolisticField> naught allowede
[2:23:50] <+MrRabbles> but why though
[2:23:57] <+QueequegTheater> "Ajna left, for her planet needed her"
[2:24:18] <hassanico2> Is the optional bonus boss Dhar's ghost back for revenge
[2:24:19] <+Capta1n_H3nry> Fuck Ajna Crew
[2:24:21] <+QueequegTheater> "Also Dhar came back and had an actual arc unlike everyone else"
[2:24:23] <marvel877> I felt that a long time ago.
[2:24:31] <DSD24> I dropped this game after Dhar dying because A I liked Dhar and B Ajna getting a new form because she made a mistake was terrible
[2:24:31] <ArtooKilledYou> Anna casted herself off the highest Kala box
[2:24:33] <+VulcanSpear> @hassanico2 banned for spoilers LUL
[2:24:37] <SleepyMaribo> optional boss is Mike Z's Cat, its in this area, and fuck that fight
[2:24:38] <marvel877> no.
[2:24:44] <CirclesForever> oof
[2:25:07] <hassanico2> This is some nasty ass platforming design
[2:25:08] <HolisticField> [roblox voice]: oof
[2:25:10] <Picia000123> Ajna getting new powers because she literally goes I NEED TO GET THROUGH THIS NOW is some dumb shit yeah

[2:25:22] <+MrRabbles> that was the one LUL
[2:25:38] <marvel877> I never fought the cat, does it actually put up a fight or is it a big dumb damage sponge and a waste of time?
[2:25:40] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1210124488463077376
[2:25:43] <DSD24> @Picia000123 She also blasted Mt Sumeneru and got no complaints
[2:25:53] <hassanico2> Like shit, fighting game devs making an RPG game is weird enough, but making the jankiest platformer at the same time? SHeesh
[2:25:54] <+gustavozxd> I'm not a platforming fan but Hollow Knight at the end was pretty fun
[2:25:57] <SleepyMaribo> like i said this area goes on way longer then it needed to.
[2:26:05] <+QueequegTheater> Reminder that DS2's Lucatiel has more interesting characterization than literally this game's entire non-Dhar cast
[2:26:07] <SleepyMaribo> and the fact you climb this thing 3 TIMES!
[2:26:13] <@Solidus_113> But don't you like playforming?
[2:26:14] <+skyheys> You know what would have been a good (cliche) story beat instead of what we're getting? [SPOILERS] If Kala splitting had been intentional, and this was all a journey of enlightenment so she could decide between another reset and letting mankind determine its own fate.
[2:26:15] <Picia000123> @DSD24 No Shut up she learned tho mistakes into miracles
[2:26:17] <TigerClaws12> RISING TACKLE
[2:26:32] <CirclesForever> that's a weird pokemon
[2:26:39] <hassanico2> @SleepyMaribo isn't he climbing this 4 times cause of sidequests?
[2:26:48] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:26:49] <hassanico2> LUL
[2:26:49] <TigerClaws12> bruh
[2:26:50] <+QueequegTheater> See if the combat was JUST THIS it would be better than the awful turn based crap
[2:26:51] <DSD24> @Picia000123 I like when protagonists get buffs for doing stupid shit and making mistakes

[2:27:04] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @sleepymaribo I know! like I get the devs wanted to show you how much you've grown, but goddamn this mountain takes soooooo long
[2:27:08] <Picia000123> @DSD24 It's the best isn't it
[2:27:11] <+gustavozxd> emojis? LUL
[2:27:14] <+VulcanSpear> yeet'd

[2:27:28] <marvel877> Is he though?
[2:27:29] <Picia000123> This part is some PLATFORMING
[2:27:43] <hassanico2> Chat, do you remember how many RAAAGHs have you RAAAGH'd in your life
[2:27:43] <@Solidus_113> there's a whole lot of "nothing here" because the map doesn't fill out enough when you go through it

[2:29:01] <Picia000123> AMAZING
[2:29:03] <Haarute> this game is the best.
[2:29:04] <+benial17> down he goes
[2:29:04] <CrazyMedicine> LMAO
[2:29:05] <aero160h> why isn't woolie doing the flying screwball move to traverse?
[2:29:05] <+gustavozxd> people with map filling OCD probably hate this game
[2:29:09] <TigerClaws12> DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT
[2:29:10] <+Capta1n_H3nry> Naga Rider: AAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[2:29:20] <+skyheys> He didn't even know where he landed

[2:30:17] <DSD24> bruh
[2:30:18] <+Grayhammatter> bruh!
[2:30:22] <+jiggy_snipe> Megaman would be proud
[2:30:22] <CirclesForever> man "Naga" really sounds like something else

[2:30:30] <CrazyMedicine> Defense upgrade!!
[2:30:35] <+QueequegTheater> My naga
[2:30:39] <thunderhog> I dont think i ever got that one
[2:30:40] <@Solidus_113> the final
[2:30:54] <hassanico2> I'm actually surprised he found them all
[2:31:19] <SleepyMaribo> just a heads up you need the max defense upgrade to survive the final boss...
[2:31:20] <Picia000123> there is no time
[2:31:21] <haisho> wait until he finds even more
[2:31:22] <hassanico2> There wasn't enough money for a fanfare Woolie
[2:31:23] <SomersaultJustice> he picked the good pokemon jingle
[2:31:25] <aero160h> so, what happened to the podcast?
[2:31:47] <EndgameContent> @SomersaultJustice I was about to say, it sounded very specific and familiar, but didn't think Woolie played Pokemon
[2:31:49] <+QueequegTheater> Flights killed Pat
[2:31:53] <DSD24> @aero160h Believe its tomorrow
[2:31:54] <+QueequegTheater> so its tomorrow

[2:32:29] <CrazyMedicine> They became force ghost
[2:32:39] <+MrRabbles> no one is ever really gone
[2:32:46] <hassanico2> Other guess, does the final boss go Persona 4 style killing off all your incarantions and then you have to bring them all back
[2:32:48] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:32:56] <@Solidus_113> no spoilers
[2:32:59] <SomersaultJustice> @EndgameContent Didn't he do that nuzlocke run everyone hates?
[2:33:09] <hassanico2> Did I seriously guess right again?
[2:33:13] <+MrRabbles> Ringsels for glory
[2:33:16] <@Solidus_113> you didn't
[2:33:22] <hassanico2> oof, good
[2:33:25] <@Solidus_113> but everyone don't talk about the final
[2:33:26] <+skyheys> @hassanico2 God I wish. I'd take just talking it out over what it actually is.
[2:33:35] <+QueequegTheater> When SoulSilver Nuzlocke Woolie
[2:33:40] <QueequegTheater> do it coward
[2:33:46] <SleepyMaribo> why even go for it, you dont need em anymore?
[2:33:47] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @hassanico2 I think Solidus is just tryna keep outta spoiler territory
[2:33:52] <EndgameContent> @SomersaultJustice Huh, must've been on 2BFP a long time ago, I can only recall it vaguely. Were they naming everything after singers?
[2:33:53] <DSD24> @QueequegTheater Nah man Heart Gold
[2:34:05] <hassanico2> Yeah I understand "random guesses in chat" might look like spoilers but I am legit blind @abelincoln_catpuncher
[2:34:09] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @endgamecontent it was rappers and wrestlers lol
[2:34:19] <SomersaultJustice> @EndgameContent yeah, that one
[2:34:22] <EndgameContent> @abelincoln_catpuncher Right, right
[2:34:24] <hassanico2> Is this just a nautilus?
[2:34:28] <+QueequegTheater> @DSD24 As long as somebody explains that using legendaries is against the spirit of the nuzlocke
[2:34:58] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @hassanico2 you're good mate
[2:35:17] <hassanico2> I kinda like golden Tungar
[2:35:19] <marvel877> I was AFK for a bit and am disappointed to still see this.
[2:35:27] <hassanico2> The colorful turban works wells
[2:35:45] <+MrRabbles> this is to go even further beyond

[2:48:39] <thunderhog> @WoolieVersus Also it spends HP
[2:48:40] <Picia000123> Damn I didn't even try that that's cool
[2:48:40] <%KoyFoster> Platform is now EZ mode.
[2:48:41] <+benial17> But is that an attack?
[2:48:41] <@Solidus_113> and you get 7 dashes, each one shorter than the last

[2:49:06] <SomersaultJustice> shine spark
[2:49:08] <EndgameContent> Watch your HP bar though
[2:49:09] <DSD24> Is it lamer that you get abilities that make your other moves obsolete?
[2:49:14] <+the_createy> health loss
[2:49:16] <TigerClaws12> health is limit
[2:49:17] <Fiendmaw> Does she do damage to herself
[2:49:17] <+JeluxDaCasual> SCREW ATTACK
[2:49:21] <@Solidus_113> there's 7, charge each to max bar
[2:49:22] <haisho> there is a limit it's called your health bar
[2:49:23] <Medo3G> HP
[2:49:28] <hassanico2> It eats HP LUL
[2:49:29] <+gustavozxd> 4 is A LOT
[2:49:33] <@Solidus_113> right, 4
[2:49:34] <Milo_Oda> you cant kill yourself with it
[2:49:40] <Haarute> running is also enhanced
[2:49:42] <+Grayhammatter> your health bar is the limit
[2:49:45] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> wow you can just fucking fly
[2:49:47] <+JeluxDaCasual> Yeah, it's eating HP
[2:49:47] <%KoyFoster> NO?
[2:49:53] <HolisticField> ajna's gay GayPride
[2:49:53] <%KoyFoster> Oh shit
[2:49:54] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> GOOD LORD
[2:50:15] <marvel877> Is he trying complete the map? Map completion gets you nothing.
[2:50:28] <thunderhog> Worse case you go into the next fight fucked, and fight it again you good
[2:50:29] <+Grayhammatter> he's doing side quests
[2:50:29] <%KoyFoster> He's just labbing right now.
[2:50:34] <@Solidus_113> villiage
[2:50:34] <+QueequegTheater> Reminder that Ajna never even held a symbolic funeral for Dhar, the only person who tried to stop her from murdering her friends
[2:50:34] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @marvel877 nah hes going to finish side quests
[2:50:35] <thunderhog> At this point it means JACK
[2:50:42] <haisho> back to Ashwat for Lanshi?
[2:50:55] <DSD24> And she still hated him after Dhar dying
[2:51:00] <+VulcanSpear> Dhar did nothing wrong then was wronged himself FeelsBadMan
[2:51:00] <Magoloso> yes, "Ajna bad". we fucking get it
[2:51:02] <%KoyFoster> @QueequegTheater She did a thing with his sword. That's enough.
[2:51:06] <ManlyMcBeefington> @QueequegTheater she stabed hs sword in the ground thou
[2:51:22] <Fiendmaw> Reminder that no one gives a fuck about anything in this universe,the story just moves forward
[2:51:26] <SleepyMaribo> oh the fuck ajna thing is gonna get pushed to the max by the end of the game
[2:51:30] <+skyheys> @magoloso You don't really get it until the ending.
[2:51:32] <Milo_Oda> nah thats where the sword landed lol
[2:51:47] <@Solidus_113> you go too fast for the camera
[2:51:50] <HolisticField> i could do without a dhar funeral cutscene
[2:51:54] <hassanico2> "Huuuuwaaaah HYAH"
[2:51:58] <hassanico2> "HU HYAH"
[2:52:02] <+MrRabbles> the ground is unnecessary
[2:52:05] <Magoloso> @skyheys I do, I've beaten it. It's bad. It's also boring now
[2:52:10] <Fiendmaw> Ajna immediately stops caring about her dad,Dhar about his men,Ravanavar about his ship,and that's just the beginning
[2:52:19] <marvel877> you go too fast for the camera just regular running. I've crashed the game several times doing that.
[2:52:20] <+QueequegTheater> But that's literally the antithesis is platforming
[2:52:23] <+QueequegTheater> *of
[2:52:45] <+jiggy_snipe> it's like ziplines Kappa
[2:52:46] <SleepyMaribo> oh lord is he gonna try and complete every inch of every map?
[2:52:55] <+gustavozxd> eh this is the end of the game, and it's not unusual for metroidvanias to get an insane ultra jump
[2:53:06] <+Piemen99> Rip to the Yt crowd
[2:53:07] <@Solidus_113> check your 7-bar Ajna super
[2:53:15] <Magoloso> It's literally before the end of the game, it's fine
[2:53:15] <marvel877> map completion yields nothing, not even a trophy.
[2:53:16] <+QueequegTheater> @gustavozxd not to this level though
[2:53:20] <+benial17> P-wing get
[2:53:50] <+gustavozxd> @queequegtheater yeah, better than this, super metroid, pretty much all of the Castlevanias and bloodstained to name a few

[2:55:28] <+QueequegTheater> GET BACK IN THE BOTTOM OF THE PARTY DAD, YOU'RE NOT OPTIMAL
[2:55:35] <Picia000123> Your Dad was so dumb he became a dog LUL
[2:55:38] <@Solidus_113> yeah it's Tai Krung
[2:55:42] <hassanico2> Thorani is at the sea of milk right?
[2:55:44] <%KoyFoster> No
[2:55:53] <+Capta1n_H3nry> nOPE
[2:55:56] <haisho> nope
[2:55:56] <marvel877> NO
[2:56:00] <ManlyMcBeefington> the red on map?
[2:56:05] <%KoyFoster> Back where you came
[2:56:06] <abelincoln_catpuncher> omg you took it here Woolie lol
[2:56:11] <+Capta1n_H3nry> You can cut to the desert or go back to the teleporter
[2:56:16] <hassanico2> You're thinking about the actual shortcut you unlocked to Tai Krung via map traversal Woolie
[2:56:28] <+Grayhammatter> you took it here LUL
[2:56:30] <+Capta1n_H3nry> Red's to the desert
[2:56:32] <marvel877> "Shortcut teleporters? What's that? Running everywhere is fun, isn't it?" - MIKE Z
[2:56:34] <ManlyMcBeefington> red is short cut to another map I think
[2:56:58] <haisho> I think a lot of people did honestly
[2:57:13] <Milo_Oda> this un-optimal movement LUL
[2:57:20] <thunderhog> @WoolieVersus Btw Woolie/Reggie Yall might wanna hit the Lab. Ajna got some new shit with her 7 meter
[2:57:25] <%KoyFoster> From desert to port city might be faster.
[2:57:52] <hassanico2> ...wouldn't Zebei's thing be at the bottom of the Lahn teleporter?
[2:57:52] <aero160h> @thunderhog it's not worth it at all
[2:57:58] <%KoyFoster> nvm
[2:58:07] <+TheRealMasterof7s> zeibei and kushi are Tai Krung, talk to the drunk monk
[2:58:07] <thunderhog> I mean i guess
[2:58:26] <marvel877> I honestly thought the missing characters that are still being developed would finally be released by the time Woolie finishes this game.
[2:58:35] <SleepyMaribo> yeah Zebai and Kushi's has you going all over the place, tai krung
[2:58:44] <aero160h> @thunderhog it looks cool, but you know...
[2:58:47] <+MrRabbles> what do you mean missing characters
[2:58:51] <@Solidus_113> elevators
[2:58:51] <haisho> or take the lift
[2:59:06] <%Gogogolem> Hey does anyone know if they added the final character yet?
[2:59:07] <Milo_Oda> go find a re spawning tank
[2:59:09] <hassanico2> @MrRabbles Shovel Knight etc...
[2:59:10] <SleepyMaribo> @MrRabbles Shantae and shovel knight are suppose to be playable
[2:59:10] <marvel877> @MrRabbles couple characters were not done for final release.
[2:59:15] <DSD24> All this Thorani statues
[2:59:27] <+skyheys> @marvel877 They still havent fixed the broken ones and only got like 15 completed over four years
[2:59:28] <marvel877> also guests like shovel knight are still being worked on.

[2:59:40] <+skyheys> @marvel877 It's gonna take a while
[3:00:00] <hassanico2> Woolie you have a dojo in your brain LUL
[3:00:13] <SleepyMaribo> enemies stop respawning after you hit past a certain level
[3:00:17] <DSD24> I like the Thorani art in the back
[3:00:32] <%Gogogolem> That painting though.
[3:00:35] <marvel877> @skyheys I don't await that and don't want to touch this game ever again. I'm that soured on the experience.
[3:00:36] <+gustavozxd> oh yeah it's good calebGasm
[3:00:44] <+gustavozxd> ART
[3:00:46] <hassanico2> ...it just hopped offscreen

[3:00:53] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:00:53] <%KoyFoster> That's a lot of THAT.
[3:00:56] <%Gogogolem> Thorani knows shes a hottie.
[3:00:56] <+MrRabbles> there is no need to comment on quality
[3:01:02] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> calebGasm
[3:01:09] <HolisticField> she knows she's hot. everyone knows she's hot
[3:01:15] <DSD24> Everyone in this game is into Thorani
[3:01:19] <hassanico2> Baozai is never gonna score
[3:01:22] <+Capta1n_H3nry> Fuck Sakura
[3:01:23] <TigerClaws12> OK
[3:01:44] <ArtooKilledYou> Belongs to the streets

[3:01:52] <hassanico2> LUL
[3:01:54] <+MrRabbles> free health sweet
[3:01:58] <+gustavozxd> the truth can be VERY mean
[3:02:22] <%KoyFoster> Keep dropping
[3:02:39] <marvel877> its not worth it looking for the cat.
[3:02:40] <hassanico2> Oh he knows about the dumb cat
[3:02:43] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus I'll send you the location of Mike's cat on twitter
[3:02:44] <+NlghtSprites> macaw1 macaw2
[3:02:46] <HolisticField> the truth is just a salad of ideas

[3:02:50] <+Grayhammatter> wow
[3:03:13] <Milo_Oda> is woolie gonna fight the cat?
[3:03:18] <+enickma11> the game ain't done until that cat is dead
[3:03:22] <hassanico2> Why are we reporting to them of all people?

[3:08:39] <ManlyMcBeefington> will woolie find the Mike Z's cat this stream?
[3:08:44] <%CaptainPileDriver> yo have they fought the cat yet or not?
[3:08:49] <marvel877> Like Roti is acknowledged one time in the opening, then never spoken about ever again.
[3:08:49] <solidoutlaw> what if roti is the real god? considering he can be anywhere and nowhere
[3:08:57] <+Grayhammatter> and bork dad
[3:08:59] <+MrRabbles> its alright
[3:09:02] <@Solidus_113> @ManlyMcBeefington I sent him the location on twitter
[3:09:05] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Still hot tho
[3:09:06] <hassanico2> Oh it's the bad ChunLi color
[3:09:24] <ManlyMcBeefington> @Solidus_113 will he check twitter?
[3:09:33] <@Solidus_113> in the stopped time, perhaps
[3:09:42] <%KoyFoster> I member
[3:09:47] <+skyheys> SHE IS, in an update
[3:09:52] <+benial17> postgame character?
[3:09:52] <+Capta1n_H3nry> WAT
[3:09:53] <+skyheys> it's not finished
[3:10:02] <+skyheys> shes a backer character
[3:10:03] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Turbo Wheelchair SCholar
[3:10:04] <@Solidus_113> Lhan might be the closer one for Kushi/Zeibei
[3:10:07] <marvel877> This game is not finished AF.
[3:10:10] <+Capta1n_H3nry> I thought it was just Sangmu and Antoine coming later?
[3:10:16] <%KoyFoster> What's going on?
[3:10:17] <ManlyMcBeefington> ^
[3:10:28] <london_flexing> That character is WACK in terms of design
[3:10:31] <ficboyog> is this part cut out of the video?
[3:10:37] <kikosmore> Ya'll having fun?
[3:10:42] <aero160h> it's funny how irrelevant doing all this is because of how the final boss fight plays out
[3:10:42] <+skyheys> no, Sangmu, Antoine, three backer characters, and like 8(?) crossover characters
[3:10:43] <ManlyMcBeefington> antonie and sangmu will be later
[3:10:43] <+BallerSwagBro9k> That silence was hilarious for some reason
[3:10:44] <Malikwest11> yup
[3:10:56] <+Capta1n_H3nry> Well shit
[3:11:02] <+skyheys> plus like five need to be fixed?
[3:11:07] <+Capta1n_H3nry> Glad I haven't beaten the game yet.
[3:11:08] <@SoushinSen> What's going on?
[3:11:10] <HolisticField> i know they already pushed back the release date by like a year but i wish they'd spent a little more time
[3:11:12] <+aishman> By the by Reggie, how you still feeling about Cash and Guns?
[3:11:15] <+skyheys> so more characters than are in the game, really
[3:11:17] <+BallerSwagBro9k> MIHN SUMMONED
[3:11:21] <thunderhog> Oh hi mihn
[3:11:24] <%CaptainPileDriver> yo, @WoolieVersus you want the dark souls boardgame for tablelords when i see you down at frosty faustings?
[3:11:32] <@SoushinSen> *Minh not mihn
[3:11:37] <+aishman> Which mission? I've finished the game Woolie and did all the missions
[3:11:44] <Medo3G> Relying on chat is not a great idea
[3:11:45] <+BallerSwagBro9k> @CaptainPileDriver DEW IT
[3:11:52] <Picia000123> I wish they would cut HALF OF THE GAME
[3:11:53] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus which mission i did every characters side mission
[3:11:56] <+aishman> OH yeah, that's to the right of the base
[3:12:07] <+aishman> Not on the bottom, on the 2nd area where you get to the mountain
[3:12:07] <Picia000123> Like, you don't need kalf of the mechanics here
[3:12:10] <+aishman> It's like mid way through the map
[3:12:15] <solidoutlaw> it's a spot where you use that arrow teleport thing
[3:12:18] <thunderhog> @WoolieVersus Bottom of sumeru, and the 2 eagles are part of that whole arrow teleport thing
[3:12:20] <@SoushinSen> are they talking about secret boss?
[3:12:23] <+skyheys> the final backer character is super cool. she's a colony of moles
[3:12:24] <+aishman> They call it "The base" but it's really when you start climbing @WoolieVersus
[3:12:24] <kikosmore> This feels depressing lol
[3:12:26] <@Solidus_113> Here's an image of the location on the map https://prnt.sc/pkkr2u
[3:12:53] <%CaptainPileDriver> THAT IS A HIDDEN AREA
[3:12:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> YOU HIT A WALL
[3:13:07] <LuLz_Emissary> my boys looking bored lol
[3:13:07] <+skyheys> stop yelling
[3:13:08] <@Solidus_113> yep
[3:13:12] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus I've finished 100% of the game, except for Mike Z's cap. The turtle is like, half way into the 1st mountain area to the rigth
[3:13:15] <@SoushinSen> castlevania wall yougotta destroy
[3:13:29] <+aishman> It's easy to see where when you see the map
[3:13:36] <marvel877> Is fighting Mike Z's cat any fun?
[3:13:38] <thunderhog> Yeah it's a hidden wall thing so yeah
[3:13:52] <Picia000123> It depends if they kill it in one combo
[3:13:55] <%CaptainPileDriver> @marvel877 i think it's super fun cause it's a combo fun
[3:13:55] <@Solidus_113> If you thought Hollow Knight's Path of Pain was bad, get ready for this shit
[3:13:57] <ManlyMcBeefington> Does MikeZ's npc in game have new dialog if you beat his cat?
[3:14:07] <solidoutlaw> hehe a bang
[3:14:16] <+BallerSwagBro9k> WELL THEN
[3:14:17] <DSD24> Hotline Miami is fucking awesome
[3:14:23] <+BallerSwagBro9k> STREAM TIME?
[3:14:33] <Picia000123> Hotline Miami looks pretty good, I gotta play it
[3:14:34] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Pig dude
[3:14:41] <hassanico2> Hotline Miami 2 ends on a bang alrigth LUL
[3:14:55] <hassanico2> Woolie you were in a video on the TBF channel where you played through half the game
[3:15:06] <DSD24> I like the first one better though
[3:15:06] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:15:09] <solidoutlaw> 2 is both better and worse than the first, worse because it's level design isn't as good :/
[3:15:12] <hassanico2> Pig rapist actor man was a big controversy
[3:15:32] <+BallerSwagBro9k> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[3:15:33] <thunderhog> BOOOOO
[3:15:34] <hassanico2> I love 2's story
[3:15:41] <DSD24> @solidoutlaw A lot of open areas with GUNS
[3:15:42] <%CaptainPileDriver> i got more bad jokes
[3:15:48] <+BallerSwagBro9k> WHY GOGO....WHYYYYY
[3:15:57] <DSD24> That was a good joke
[3:15:58] <hassanico2> Batshit crazy is underselling it LUL
[3:16:01] <kikosmore> the waist lmao. Just got it.
[3:16:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> i'm here and tired
[3:16:22] <+aishman> Oh @WoolieVersus by the by, if you are ever able to get 8 people for Tablelords, I super recommend Captain Sonar. It's a 4 v 4 game where each team is the crew of a sub trying to destroy the other submarine
[3:16:23] <DSD24> It was so good
[3:16:25] <HolisticField> my pp itches :(
[3:16:27] <Haarute> how far are you into jojo reggie?
[3:16:32] <thunderhog> So corny it was almost a husk of a joke
[3:16:45] <+BallerSwagBro9k> That sounds rad
[3:16:48] <vVAstrAVv> so what comes after indivisible
[3:16:51] <kikosmore> Do you like this game Reggie?
[3:16:53] <@SoushinSen> near impossible
[3:16:53] <+BallerSwagBro9k> What was the name again?
[3:16:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> Who is bigger: Mr. Bigger or Mr. Bigger's baby? The baby, because she's a little bigger.
[3:17:12] <Picia000123> @vVAstrAVv despair and indifference
[3:17:18] <+gustavozxd> skip 6 MiniK
[3:17:30] <ficboyog> yeah i feel you reggie
[3:17:37] <+BallerSwagBro9k> oh god
[3:17:43] <+Capta1n_H3nry> Ajna for Skullgirls when
[3:17:44] <+BallerSwagBro9k> it hurts LUL
[3:17:46] <+Piemen99> horrible
[3:17:53] <+Piemen99> i love it
[3:17:59] <ficboyog> have you guys thought about inviting pat on to table lords?
[3:17:59] <Picia000123> I don't wanna see Ajna in anything ever again
[3:18:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> I bought some shoes off of a drug dealer. I don't know what he laced them with but I've been trippin' all day.
[3:18:04] <thunderhog> @WoolieVersus Will you guys ever do Exceed fighting system for Table lords. It's a 2 player card game that plays like a fighting game with footsies and everything
[3:18:08] <Malikwest11> my pc turned off what happenin?
[3:18:09] <Soulbishop> Ooooo Reggie STREAM!!!!
[3:18:10] <ficboyog> pat and paige that is
[3:18:13] <+aishman> I always get water since I'm working
[3:18:14] <+skyheys> Tell Woolie that Wheelchair girl is playable in a future patch so he stops asking, Reggie
[3:18:17] <Soulbishop> Yeah finally Reggie took over
[3:18:19] <zafooru> hydrate or die-drate, as they say
[3:18:27] <Magoloso> hydro hommies
[3:18:27] <+BallerSwagBro9k> I kept wondering why the baseball was getting bigger, and then it hit me...
[3:18:34] <Soulbishop> awww never mind
[3:18:37] <+Grayhammatter> that's dumb, but i can dig it
[3:18:51] <%CaptainPileDriver> How does Moses make his tea? Hebrews it!
[3:19:05] <Soulbishop> Was that a damn scrunchy!?
[3:19:12] <+aishman> Also, to be fair Reggie, I did say "if ever" for the 8 people. I'm lucky that there's a game shop around these parts with a lot of active board game people. A trade off I suppose with the dead fighting game scene here
[3:19:14] <zafooru> daaamn
[3:19:15] <Picia000123> check yourself before you wreck yourself
[3:19:18] <%ozzrabbit> I wonder if Woolie likes playing Fighting Games because he enjoys committing Reggie-cide
[3:19:18] <+Grayhammatter> oof
[3:19:20] <zafooru> throwing shade on improv
[3:19:21] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Is this the direction the Woolie chat base wished to go? LUL
[3:19:24] <+gustavozxd> daaaamn Woolie
[3:19:32] <%CaptainPileDriver> What did sushi A say to sushi B? Wasa-b!
[3:19:43] <Picia000123> it's pity funny
[3:19:46] <SomersaultJustice> how can he say something so controversial and yet so brave
[3:20:03] <+BallerSwagBro9k> UNcut Cringe....
[3:20:04] <HolisticField> cringe isnt real
[3:20:22] <+Capta1n_H3nry> Ajna is cringe.
[3:20:29] <+BallerSwagBro9k> NO REGGIE

[3:30:50] <SleepyMaribo> a reminder that Woolie now has to CLIMB all the way back down because short cuts in this games are so far out of the way.
[3:30:51] <hassanico2> oh, it's somewhat stronger than the actual story bosses LUL
[3:30:51] <+Grayhammatter> very wrong
[3:30:53] <@Solidus_113> Con flu striking
[3:30:56] <Picia000123> And we're done here
[3:31:11] <hassanico2> back to fucking... Tai Krung... ughhhhh
[3:31:13] <@Solidus_113> once again
[3:31:29] <Picia000123> Amazing
[3:31:39] <hassanico2> Pat was SO right about this game
[3:31:43] <+Polter_ge1st> I can't believe this game have Woolie divine blanka balls as a way of traversal heh
[3:31:50] <hassanico2> It actively hurts me to see how much good reception it got
[3:31:58] <Picia000123> Pat was never more right about any game as much as this
[3:32:16] <HolisticField> invisible wall
[3:32:17] <Picia000123> it actually didn't get that much
[3:32:18] <@Solidus_113> nope
[3:32:21] <%ozzrabbit> BringMe2Life is getting too strong!
[3:32:24] <@Solidus_113> gotta go the long way
[3:32:25] <+ForgeTacular14> at least you had the foresight to get Heaven's Wheel before doing all this backtracking.... unlike me...
[3:32:32] <hassanico2> GAME DESIGN
[3:32:39] <+mans51> Has she unlocked some sort of naurto form now? haven't followed too well
[3:32:42] <+QueequegTheater> Because fighting game devs are not equipped to make a 2D platformer
[3:32:43] <+Dragon4234> Thanks MikeZ
[3:32:51] <+Capta1n_H3nry> Wait no
[3:32:53] <SomersaultJustice> ringringringringring
[3:33:05] <+skyheys> hnnn-gyeah

[3:33:09] <Picia000123> @QueequegTheater and an RPG, and metroidvania and a platformer and
[3:33:15] <HolisticField> @Man51 this is what it means to go further beyond
[3:33:16] <+Matt_Made> Hi DHAR

[3:33:32] <%gatorafan> @hassanico2, I personally think I'm going to go and find a way to get the game and play it myself
[3:33:41] <alrobot2014> @hassanico2 funny you mention that, i binged his playthrough o f it last week
[3:33:44] <+mans51> at what point don't you just let the player fly instead ..
[3:33:44] <SomersaultJustice> it looks really nice though, I'd like to play this some day on sale
[3:33:54] <Picia000123> @QueequegTheater DMC and god of war are more RPG than this
[3:33:54] <hassanico2> @alrobot2014 he knows the thing inside out, it's almost scary
[3:34:05] <@Solidus_113> There's still Yan
[3:34:13] <hassanico2> Yan's done no?
[3:34:13] <+MrRabbles> didn't they do yan
[3:34:17] <hassanico2> We met her dad

[3:34:50] <SomersaultJustice> so after this is a Treasure of the Rudra's playthrough right Kappa
[3:35:00] <hassanico2> Cause this game totally shipped finished and then didn't get a single significant patch for over 3 months LUL
[3:35:03] <vVAstrAVv> guys your confusing punch dad lol
[3:35:08] <Picia000123> Hell no

[3:36:48] <thunderhog> Teleporting to lahn? NAH RUN IT BACK
[3:36:50] <hassanico2> GAME DESIGN
[3:36:55] <DSD24> Is this backtracking?
[3:37:05] <+JeluxDaCasual> Hungus Bends, the Baz never ends!
[3:37:05] <Picia000123> This is hella backtracking
[3:37:10] <+Dragon4234> Moi ikkai!
[3:37:12] <SomersaultJustice> so it's confirmed this is coming out for switch in june? are they going to add any of the other stuff they wanted to add by then?
[3:37:18] <HolisticField> thank god there s a map,.. that you can only view while standing stil...
[3:37:20] <+skyheys> FFXIV is an MMO designed to waste your time and it has better fetch quests
[3:37:26] <vVAstrAVv> its backtracking the backtracking
[3:37:35] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Cell phones would destroy the Seinfeldverse LUL
[3:37:38] <hassanico2> Hot take incoming
[3:37:41] <Milo_Oda> what if you could teleport between bells
[3:37:41] <Picia000123> @SomersaultJustice I sure fucking hope so
[3:37:44] <%CaptainPileDriver> @SomersaultJustice idk, i only know this cause my physical order in delayed until then, since they still haven't said anything about it
[3:37:44] <+JeluxDaCasual> Never Back Down 3: Indivisible
[3:37:45] <hassanico2> This is worse than any Neptunia game LUL
[3:37:59] <%ozzrabbit> You know, since Zone-Tan’s in this game... I wonder how many were printed to find out who she is?
[3:38:08] <+MrRabbles> Romeo and Juliet can just send nudes to each other without all the suicide
[3:38:22] <DSD24> You are a saucy boy
[3:38:33] <@Solidus_113> Have you SEEN Juliet's Insta pics?
[3:38:43] <Picia000123> I am fucking baffled how this game got 77 on Metacritic
[3:38:52] <DSD24> All this because Ajna didn't listen to Dhar
[3:38:59] <+MrRabbles> LUL
[3:39:06] <hassanico2> Prrrrrrromotion
[3:39:14] <abelincoln_catpuncher> man the crowd here really turned on Indivisble lol
[3:39:17] <%ozzrabbit> How about the pictures of Romeo’s gun? The one with “Longsword” etched on it?
[3:39:21] <+Grayhammatter> why are you baffled?
[3:39:38] <Picia000123> I thought it got 74 :P
[3:39:38] <+QueequegTheater> Reminder that for some fucking reason this has a 77 on MC but DS2 Scholar got a 79
[3:39:41] <hassanico2> @abelincoln_catpuncher watching the movement live on stream is torturous dude
[3:39:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> yeah, i mean, i enjoyed it, the back tracking stuff sucks but i still enjoyed the rest o fit
[3:39:53] <zafooru> Its A-Me! WAHooo!
[3:39:53] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Protector of Ashes
[3:39:58] <DSD24> Kushi's Mariane from Three Houses
[3:40:00] <thunderhog> Protecter of the bell
[3:40:01] <+skyheys> wow cool she needed him to say it instead of like...doing something
[3:40:08] <Picia000123> I enjoyed the first couple of hours
[3:40:10] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Sounds way more badass than it is LUL
[3:40:18] <+QueequegTheater> @DSD24 except Marianne is interesting
[3:40:21] <Picia000123> Then it went downhill hella fast
[3:40:29] <thunderhog> It's a dark souls bell. clearly needs protecting
[3:40:36] <DSD24> @QueequegTheater I like both but you are right Marianne is better
[3:40:38] <clonexsniperx> time to become belfry dicks in ds2?
[3:40:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> idk, i enjoyed it all other than having to back track for the side-quests
[3:40:52] <hassanico2> The Dhar slot
[3:40:54] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Bard girl
[3:40:58] <hassanico2> So you may never forget your shame
[3:41:01] <+Grayhammatter> missing the dhar slot
[3:41:04] <Picia000123> It just sucks, since you can clearly tell that they took on too many things at once
[3:41:06] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus dhar
[3:41:09] <+JeluxDaCasual> The Fuck Dhar slot
[3:41:12] <+skyheys> GOD I WISH

[3:42:13] <thunderhog> Oh yeah you never dod look at doggos colors
[3:42:18] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @hassanico2 I'm not saying its unwarranted, just funny how easily people flip on a game. I do agree with most of the critiques, but damn I need an ice pack for all these burns
[3:42:27] <+QueequegTheater> green

[3:45:07] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Gyaru Raz
[3:45:08] <+skyheys> he's rock howard

[3:45:55] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Zahra has such a cringe goodbye omg
[3:46:02] <SomersaultJustice> time to stomp the final boss
[3:46:02] <%CaptainPileDriver> i guess, idk, this game i do like, i just want them to add teleport between save points once you get the deva powers
[3:46:11] <Picia000123> Oh god, I forgot about goodbyes
[3:46:12] <@Solidus_113> aaaaaaaall the way down back to the start of the final section ResidentSleeper
[3:46:13] <vVAstrAVv> its the end at last
[3:46:15] <thunderhog> The final boss as in mike Z's cat
[3:46:19] <Picia000123> This is gonna suuuuck
[3:46:30] <abelincoln_catpuncher> here we goooooo
[3:46:31] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Nah final boss is EZ
[3:46:32] <HolisticField> overall i liked the game, but it was frustrating in all the wrong ways
[3:46:33] <zafooru> lushi PLS GO
[3:46:33] <SleepyMaribo> nope they going to try to find the Cat...
[3:46:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus guess what, you get to do some legit pain in the ass platforming
[3:46:34] <Haarute> i don't think this is a good idea but alright.
[3:46:40] <+Matt_Made> Final boss is fun
[3:46:43] <+QueequegTheater> Get rid of Ren, he sucks
[3:46:43] <+MrRabbles> lookin like the crew
[3:46:45] <@Solidus_113> keep that save in mind, because I HIGHLY DOUBT you'll even get to Mike's cat, let alone beat him
[3:46:45] <+BallerSwagBro9k> THIS MUSIC THO
[3:46:47] <hassanico2> Props to Ren for being busted
[3:46:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> put a healer for mikez's cat just in case honestly
[3:46:54] <hassanico2> Like goddamn, ahegao ninja is OP
[3:46:58] <SleepyMaribo> all the way left
[3:47:00] <abelincoln_catpuncher> is it just me, or is it harder going to the secret boss with the final upgrade?
[3:47:01] <%gatorafan> Kinda odd that for all the hate Ren got as a character he became a solid member on Woolie's team.
[3:47:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> keep going down
[3:47:10] <@Solidus_113> keep going down
[3:47:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> no
[3:47:14] <+QueequegTheater> Down
[3:47:15] <abelincoln_catpuncher> since it starts you at the beginning if you even start it
[3:47:16] <+BallerSwagBro9k> This theme slaps HARD
[3:47:27] <%CaptainPileDriver> go dooown, it's near the beginning of this area

[3:49:03] <thunderhog> Oh she actuall tells you shit. When i talked to her i swear she does didnt work
[3:49:06] <%Lion_kun> how much game do they have left?

[3:51:28] <thunderhog> Reggie with the eyes
[3:51:30] <AzPharizon> Hey forgive me if this has been asked. I've been a fan for a while , is it possible to get a small upload if the "needs more salt" videos ?
[3:51:32] <@Solidus_113> yep

[3:51:45] <@Solidus_113> here we go

[3:52:02] <Picia000123> This better be really good
[3:52:02] <@SoushinSen> I don't think Woolie can reach the boss, lol
[3:52:04] <Haarute> i'm not ready for this and neither are they.
[3:52:07] <+QueequegTheater> That's exactly how Path of Pain was hidden. Like, the EXACT same
[3:52:07] <@Solidus_113> GUESS WHAT? YOU CAN'T USE YOUR GOD DASH HERE
[3:52:08] <Aussie_Manny> ZA WARUDO
[3:52:08] <%CaptainPileDriver> you did all they're sidequests and got the final level up
[3:52:11] <zafooru> COUNTER
[3:52:12] <@Solidus_113> BANNED
[3:52:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> you can't use that ability
[3:52:17] <HolisticField> naught allowed
[3:52:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> SKILL ONLY AREA
[3:52:18] <thunderhog> BANNED
[3:52:21] <Milo_Oda> Banned LUL
[3:52:21] <SleepyMaribo> not allowed to use that ability
[3:52:21] <%KoyFoster> YOU MAY NOT DO THAT HERE
[3:52:22] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @soushinsen I wouldn't blame him, its ridiculous
[3:52:25] <gatorafan> God mode disabled SoBayed
[3:52:25] <@SoushinSen> taking bets now
[3:52:31] <@Solidus_113> HERE WE GO PATH OF PAIN
[3:52:40] <SleepyMaribo> gotta do this whole area without using deva
[3:52:42] <%KoyFoster> THIS IS THE REAL PLATFORMING TEST
[3:52:44] <Aussie_Manny> No Homing Attack, son.
[3:52:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> you got yo combo it
[3:52:45] <faeron93> this bullshit path lol
[3:52:51] <Haarute> this is the path you must go through in order to reach nirvana.
[3:52:52] <jase__x> gotta do it in one go
[3:52:56] <%CaptainPileDriver> a true platforming skill test
[3:53:01] <SleepyMaribo> this area is called path of pain by the way
[3:53:04] <%gatorafan> Do Platform Combo Woolie!
[3:53:19] <+QueequegTheater> @SleepyMaribo Wait, seriously?
[3:53:24] <blerrger19> Got recommended to follow your channel from one of A_German_Spy's subscribers! Cheers!
[3:53:34] <@Solidus_113> There are 5 sections of this, each way harder than the last. and if you fail you get reset to the start of the current section
[3:53:44] <SleepyMaribo> @QueequegTheater yes its a platform challenge stemming on frustrating to no end.
[3:53:53] <HolisticField> kusoge indivisible
[3:53:54] <vVAstrAVv> is THIS the boss?
[3:53:54] <Picia000123> So, what are the bets guys
[3:53:58] <zafooru> dont get fancy
[3:54:03] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus this is a legit hard as fuck area to complete
[3:54:05] <Picia000123> Will woolie give up or get to the kitty
[3:54:06] <SleepyMaribo> you have ot do it all in one go, if you die it resets you to the beginning
[3:54:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> normal dash with the reset thing
[3:54:15] <@Solidus_113> uppercut dash
[3:54:16] <%KoyFoster> This wasn't so bad. I ran into technically issues at the end though.
[3:54:18] <+QueequegTheater> @SleepyMaribo No, I know, I've 105% HK. Is it called literally the same thing here? Because that's the laziest fucking shit I've ever heard
[3:54:22] <DSD24> Is there a Path of Pain in Hollow Knight?
[3:54:25] <@SoushinSen> 2:8 succeed/fail
[3:54:33] <+QueequegTheater> @DSD24 Yes
[3:54:33] <@Solidus_113> you can't hold the button at all
[3:55:13] <+skyheys> that's dumb
[3:55:21] <%CaptainPileDriver> no map
[3:55:25] <@Solidus_113> test your might
[3:55:27] <SixthSun2> Map disabled
[3:55:29] <+MrRabbles> just do it right
[3:55:29] <Picia000123> oh god
[3:55:33] <jase__x> GET GUD
[3:55:38] <Picia000123> I am glad I didn't do this LUL
[3:55:38] <+QueequegTheater> They even changed the dash into the Hollow Knight dash what the fuck LUL
[3:55:53] <%CaptainPileDriver> now you have a new respawn point here
[3:55:59] <+enickma11> New section
[3:56:25] <thunderhog> Almost first try
[3:56:31] <%KoyFoster> Aw. Almost first try.
[3:56:34] <+QueequegTheater> This is also way easier than the actual PoP
[3:56:47] <zafooru> new checkpoint tho so thats nice
[3:56:58] <%gatorafan> @queequegtheater, Yeah, I'm not sure this even hits White Palace. daedra1DerpyTibs
[3:56:59] <@Solidus_113> 1 of 5 done
[3:57:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> yep.
[3:57:06] <vVAstrAVv> glad hws not timed lpl
[3:57:17] <SleepyMaribo> i saw someone do it in one go and he was so pissed by the end of it, it goes on way to long
[3:57:20] <%CaptainPileDriver> the hardest one is the last one cause it requires weird timing
[3:57:33] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[3:57:50] <%CaptainPileDriver> it took me forever to get used that last one
[3:57:50] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:58:15] <@Solidus_113> I had to look up a video on the final piece before the fight because it was so jank
[3:58:17] <Milo_Oda> short hop my guy
[3:58:17] <+BallerSwagBro9k> BIG Guacamelee vibes
[3:58:26] <Picia000123> This song is gonna show up in my nightmares
[3:58:28] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Solidus_113 so did i
[3:58:31] <+QueequegTheater> Don't insult Guacamelee
[3:58:32] <+enickma11> @Solidus_113 Same, its super janky
[3:58:44] <vVAstrAVv> just do it perfect :p
[3:58:45] <abelincoln_catpuncher> I gave up so hard on this shit lol
[3:58:51] <+BallerSwagBro9k> @QueequegTheater I said Vibes, not as good as LUL
[3:59:00] <+QueequegTheater> Fair
[3:59:01] <zafooru> high jump
[3:59:07] <@Solidus_113> spring jump
[3:59:08] <+enickma11> Vault jump
[3:59:15] <%KoyFoster> Git gud
[3:59:18] <Milo_Oda> spear vault
[3:59:25] <jase__x> wow this is the worst
[3:59:27] <%CaptainPileDriver> @QueequegTheater guacamelee 2 has some BULLSHIT for the true ending in terms of it's platoforming chicken areas
[3:59:32] <zafooru> glaive propel
[3:59:40] <Milo_Oda> LUL
[3:59:42] <Picia000123> This is so bad
[3:59:49] <+QueequegTheater> @CaptainPileDriver Harder than Hollow Knight's Path of Pain?
[4:00:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> idk, haven't played hollow knight yet so idk
[4:00:07] <+enickma11> @QueequegTheater Absolutely not, plus this one is way shorter
[4:00:11] <Milo_Oda> both are pretty easy Kappa
[4:00:12] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Path of Pain was the ultimate. Ive never seen harder
[4:00:16] <vVAstrAVv> why of all the lps are we 100% this one
[4:00:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> 2/5 now done
[4:00:22] <Picia000123> oh thank god for checkpoints
[4:00:24] <+BallerSwagBro9k> In modern games anyway
[4:00:42] <+QueequegTheater> You haven't played Super Meat Boy?
[4:00:47] <%gatorafan> I mean, there are entire games made of Path of Pain
[4:00:49] <@Solidus_113> you need to save the uppercut
[4:00:54] <+BallerSwagBro9k> @QueequegTheater No actually
[4:00:54] <abelincoln_catpuncher> no way Path of Pain is damn near as hard as super meat boy
[4:00:56] <+jiggy_snipe> omg only 2/5?
[4:01:10] <Picia000123> I haven't play Super meat man, noi
[4:01:20] <%gatorafan> cool
[4:01:21] <%CaptainPileDriver> gotta go at an angle for that one
[4:01:32] <%CaptainPileDriver> no
[4:01:33] <Picia000123> I wanna try it though
[4:01:39] <Picia000123> Must be better than THIS
[4:01:41] <SleepyMaribo> the reward is so not worth it btw
[4:01:45] <+QueequegTheater> @BallerSwagBro9k Super Meat Boy is an entire game that hits PoP level about halfway through and keeps going up
[4:01:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> 3/5
[4:01:57] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Jesus
[4:02:06] <+BallerSwagBro9k> That woould be too much for me LUL
[4:02:11] <+Grayhammatter> the aim was not true enough
[4:02:21] <%CaptainPileDriver> 4/5
[4:02:22] <@Solidus_113> 4/5
[4:02:23] <+BallerSwagBro9k> MY hands ached for hours after PoP
[4:02:28] <%gatorafan> I was almost expecting the god dash to send it back to the beginning daedra1LaughingTibs
[4:02:30] <@Solidus_113> here's the fucking nightmare
[4:02:31] <+enickma11> Here we are
[4:02:37] <Milo_Oda> last stretch? or is there one more
[4:02:42] <%CaptainPileDriver> this is the hardest stretch
[4:02:51] <@Solidus_113> THIS SHIT
[4:02:52] <SleepyMaribo> fuck this PART!!!!
[4:02:53] <@Solidus_113> FUCK
[4:02:53] <%CaptainPileDriver> last stretch
[4:02:56] <%CaptainPileDriver> THIS IS THE BULLSHIT
[4:03:05] <+Grayhammatter> WOW
[4:03:07] <Picia000123> FUCK
[4:03:09] <+RagnarXIV> ouch
[4:03:10] <+QueequegTheater> Okay, this is about White Palace level
[4:03:11] <Milo_Oda> who wants to keep count
[4:03:12] <+Grayhammatter> that's BULLSHIT
[4:03:15] <%CaptainPileDriver> YOU HAVE TO CANCEL OUT OF IT WITH A DASH
[4:03:16] <+aishman> That's so fucked
[4:03:19] <Picia000123> You can't see past that
[4:03:20] <@Solidus_113> you gotta save all your dashes for that bit
[4:03:22] <jase__x> wow this is TERRIBLE
[4:03:23] <Picia000123> THat is bullshit
[4:03:25] <+Hasmeister96> Is there a way to dash downwards?
[4:03:30] <ultimatemegahero1> Hello?
[4:03:33] <%CaptainPileDriver> literally have to save the dash for that one part
[4:03:36] <PluckyLuck> LUL LUL LUL
[4:03:41] <+QueequegTheater> Lotta chat hasn't played SMB or beaten Path of Pain LUL
[4:03:43] <SleepyMaribo> a reminder the reward for all this, is not worth it
[4:03:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> this legit took me almost 40 minutes because of mynope.
[4:04:04] <Picia000123> @QueequegTheater I really did not LUL
[4:04:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> *my habbits
[4:04:06] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @ultimatemegahero1
[4:04:09] <+Wild_Samurai> I know people think this is fun but it really isn’t. This is horrible game design
[4:04:16] <+QueequegTheater> @SleepyMaribo Path of Pain literally has zero reward or achievement associated with it but it's still fun
[4:04:16] <%CaptainPileDriver> i enjoyed it
[4:04:24] <ultimatemegahero1> Sorry but big news
[4:04:24] <@Solidus_113> yeah that happens sometimes
[4:04:27] <%Lion_kun> you know most games don't make you go through hoops tog et to a super boss
[4:04:28] <+enickma11> Oh this was super fun, I love challenges like this
[4:04:30] <Magoloso> I think it's fun
[4:04:34] <Picia000123> Heard they are pretty fun games
[4:04:34] <+Cobaltor_252> it's only fun if I say so
[4:04:35] <Angry_Ev1L> horrible game design is putting this music for section you'll need billion tries
[4:04:56] <%CaptainPileDriver> this music is good what do you mean?
[4:04:56] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:04:58] <%Lion_kun> okay they do but not this bad
[4:04:58] <ultimatemegahero1> There might be more DMC5 content announced soon too
[4:05:03] <+jiggy_snipe> this is really interesting. needs a better song even though this isn't terrible, the loop is too short though
[4:05:07] <+JingKaisean> you like this thing? oh I hate that thing, that thing fucking sucks OHHHHHHHH
[4:05:11] <%Lion_kun> Source for DMC5 news?
[4:05:14] <Magoloso> "you think it's fun but it's not" is a really terrible argument.
[4:05:22] <+Grayhammatter> one, ah ah ah
[4:05:25] <%KoyFoster> No hesitation. Just like your combos.
[4:05:26] <+QueequegTheater> @Lion_kun Matt Walker uploaded a video
[4:05:29] <%gatorafan> @ultimatemegahero1, That's just especulation, could be anything. Even more DMC5 content.
[4:05:35] <%Lion_kun> tx
[4:05:36] <+QueequegTheater> To Capcom US's twitter I think
[4:05:50] <+Wild_Samurai> Vergil is DMC is always a thing. Always paid bundled with a special edition.
[4:05:57] <Picia000123> I can't wait for Geralt in DMC with Vergil's moveset Kappa
[4:06:03] <+skyheys> @magoloso the proper argument is "You think it's fun, but it's bad."
[4:06:03] <%KoyFoster> So close
[4:06:06] <@Solidus_113> no cheese allowed
[4:06:08] <+BallerSwagBro9k> If we get more DMc 5 stuff that isnt Vergil i will go Full Gamer RAge Mode
[4:06:10] <@Solidus_113> only true gamers
[4:06:10] <+MrRabbles> i hated white palace in Hollow Knight because the rest of the game never seemed to demand as much before that moment
[4:06:17] <ultimatemegahero1> Well they have 3 streams planned it's speculation but why have 3 major streams just for new DMC3 content?
[4:06:24] <zafooru> Dio cat has NO tolerance for flight
[4:06:27] <+QueequegTheater> @MrRabbles You do Path of Pain as well?
[4:06:27] <SleepyMaribo> yeah its shit game design to restrict one of your powers because lol look at my platforming guys!
[4:06:27] <%gatorafan> @ballerswagbro9k, but what if it's Lucia daedra1DrunkTibs
[4:06:33] <+MrRabbles> compared to that i feel like the lead up was there in this
[4:06:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> YOU USED THE DASH WOOLIE
[4:06:34] <zayasu> LUL
[4:06:36] <+JingKaisean> no virgil? how dare they not give me the thing I made up in my head
[4:06:37] <%CaptainPileDriver> you can't use the dash
[4:06:43] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus you already used your regular dash for the spike cancel
[4:06:49] <ultimatemegahero1> In fact why new DMC3 content at all if they weren't planning something?
[4:06:52] <+MrRabbles> no i didn't touch the additional content for hollow knight
[4:06:55] <RyuuAoi> This isn't the podcast!! PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[4:07:09] <vVAstrAVv> dmc streams? when?
[4:07:10] <+JingKaisean> which podcast?
[4:07:16] <+aishman> Use the other dash
[4:07:17] <+QueequegTheater> @MrRabbles It's a hidden Super Meat Boy challenge in White Palace. It's super fun
[4:07:22] <+FrostedZaibatsu> I had to look up a video for the ending. So many mechanics unexplained in this game
[4:07:23] <Magoloso> Another god rejected
[4:07:26] <HolisticField> pls play dmc remake its so gooood
[4:07:26] <+JeluxDaCasual> POGO?
[4:07:29] <+aishman> Since you're hitting the object, that refreshes the axe dash
[4:07:31] <Milo_Oda> time to sit on the ceiling and think for SeemsGood
[4:07:36] <+QueequegTheater> @HolisticField Kappa
[4:07:37] <ultimatemegahero1> I hope someone get get this info to Wools. :)
[4:07:47] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus Use side triangle again, if you hit something with it, it resets
[4:07:48] <Haarute> dash with triangle into down axe?
[4:07:49] <+AnthraxJohnson> Thanks Mike Z
[4:07:49] <RyuuAoi> You got this, Woolie!
[4:07:51] <%CaptainPileDriver> the mechanics i didn't know were the parries you can do to getting hit in the overworld
[4:07:52] <+MrRabbles> by the time i got to white palace i felt done with Hollow Knight and just wanted the game to wrap up
[4:07:59] <thunderhog> You just have to save your dash longer
[4:08:07] <+Piemen99> has either pat or woolie touch the Hollow knight dlc with all of those bosses?
[4:08:24] <+BallerSwagBro9k> @Piemen99 Nope
[4:08:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Piemen99 you can check pat's stream archives of it but i don't think so
[4:08:32] <+QueequegTheater> @Piemen99 Pat did everything except Godmaster
[4:08:32] <@Solidus_113> Axe also has DI, which you'll need for the absolute final move to the boss door
[4:08:35] <Magoloso> I did not even finish Grim Troupe. Let alone Godseeker
[4:08:41] <+aishman> Yeah pretty sure Pat did
[4:08:45] <+Piemen99> cool
[4:08:50] <+BallerSwagBro9k> I beat it. It took me longer than the actual game
[4:08:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> axe then axe again
[4:08:55] <+MrRabbles> Grimp Troupe was a chore with the in between stuff you had to do just to get to the bosses
[4:08:57] <%gatorafan> Oh yeah, Pat got to Nightmare King and nope'd the fuck out like a coward LUL
[4:08:59] <RyuuAoi> It's broken now....LP CANCELLED.
[4:09:00] <+aishman> Hope for best
[4:09:01] <%CaptainPileDriver> then you gotta use the axe di so have fun
[4:09:05] <Milo_Oda> sit on the ceiling and think Kapppa
[4:09:16] <+enickma11> @gatorafan To be fair that fight is HARD
[4:09:17] <+QueequegTheater> @MrRabbles Nightmare King Grimm's title splash tho Kreygasm
[4:09:21] <@Solidus_113> close
[4:09:23] <zafooru> better
[4:09:36] <%gatorafan> Nightmare King's music Kreygasm
[4:09:37] <+BallerSwagBro9k> @QueequegTheater Then the music Kreygasm
[4:09:43] <RyuuAoi> F U K
[4:09:49] <%Lion_kun> this is like pulling teeth
[4:09:54] <Magoloso> Regular Grimm pushed my shit in hard, then I got to NKG and the game was like "ok now do it for real". nah
[4:09:54] <+BallerSwagBro9k> CANT WAIT FOR SILKSONG OMG
[4:09:55] <%gatorafan> Man I can't wait for Silksong
[4:09:55] <+QueequegTheater> Woolie there's a cool area in Hollow Knight called the Path of Pain you should check out Kappa
[4:10:01] <%gatorafan> FUCK
[4:10:06] <$GuardlyGuard> AHHHHHHHHHH
[4:10:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> yep
[4:10:10] <+BallerSwagBro9k> @gatorafan LUL
[4:10:13] <+MrRabbles> i didn't get far into Godseeker but i appreciated the new boss fights
[4:10:19] <+JeluxDaCasual> double Ax dash Woolie
[4:10:22] <@Solidus_113> we gonna be here for a hot minute
[4:10:23] <+Wild_Samurai> Platforming things you can’t even see for another screen scroll is extra turd
[4:10:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> axe, axe, down axe, dash, then axe and DI into the boss hole
[4:10:37] <%Lion_kun> Path of pain is not this bad, at least it has fairer checkpoints
[4:10:38] <Picia000123> @Wild_Samurai It really is
[4:10:49] <RyuuAoi> If Woolie pulls this off, he gains +3 strength points IRL. FUCKING A
[4:10:56] <+QueequegTheater> Yeah, in most non-Sonic platformers the character stays centered no matter what
[4:11:03] <+QueequegTheater> THANKS MIKE Z
[4:11:22] <Picia000123> If Woolie pulls this off, I will be glad for him and for this to be over
[4:11:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> the checkpoint is fair, it's at the beginning of the challenge and this is the last one, it's just hard as shit cause it messes with what you would normally do
[4:11:54] <PluckyLuck> You got this
[4:12:01] <+QueequegTheater> I hope there's an enemy at the end that can kill you and send you back to square one
[4:12:01] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1210124488463077376
[4:12:02] <Picia000123> It would really help if you could move your camera to see the whole level
[4:12:10] <Magoloso> You can do it my Woolie!
[4:12:11] <RyuuAoi> Gotta think it over!
[4:12:12] <HolisticField> sure hope that secret boss is worth it Kappa
[4:12:20] <SleepyMaribo> yeah Mike should stick to making fighting game....
[4:12:21] <RyuuAoi> Woolie will figure it out
[4:12:28] <%CaptainPileDriver> you could do that with a lot of games and it would trivialize a lot of things @Picia000123
[4:12:50] <Magoloso> @CaptainPileDriver noh but "game bad" tho
[4:12:58] <+QueequegTheater> @CaptainPileDriver then those are badly designed areas
[4:13:01] <RyuuAoi> Secret boss is Dhar's Dad PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[4:13:02] <+QueequegTheater> This one isn't
[4:13:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's a challenge area
[4:13:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's supposed to be hard
[4:13:13] <+QueequegTheater> This is a legitimately good area
[4:13:14] <+JingKaisean> still not as tough as ishin the sword Saint
[4:13:18] <PluckyLuck> Close!
[4:13:18] <+QueequegTheater> That is ruined by the camera
[4:13:26] <+Wild_Samurai> This sort of level design fad is why Mario Maker is a wasteland after launch
[4:13:45] <@SoushinSen> honestly that part is the hardest due to camera and not due to the platformning
[4:13:47] <+skyheys> @magoloso "but game not bad tho" is just as vapid
[4:14:00] <@SoushinSen> it's hard to get the right timing if oyu can't see where you're going
[4:14:05] <+QueequegTheater> ^
[4:14:18] <+skyheys> yeah, thos could use a bit of zoom out
[4:14:20] <RyuuAoi> Billy in this BITCH!! Hey, Billy!
[4:14:29] <+skyheys> the assets are really big compared to ajna
[4:14:30] <+JeluxDaCasual> double Axe dash
[4:14:31] <%Lion_kun> this is just badly designed
[4:14:35] <+QueequegTheater> MInh has it 100%, there's a difference between fuck-you-hard and hard-because-shitty-camera
[4:14:40] <+skyheys> the design is fine
[4:14:45] <+JeluxDaCasual> collison resets Axe dash
[4:14:48] <HolisticField> every platformer needs to consider the balance between zooming in vs zooming out, this is an example of zooming too far in
[4:14:48] <Milo_Oda> its so jank to make that jump
[4:14:50] <Magoloso> @skyheys The game is flawed as all hell. But now we got to a point where the challenge area is bad because it's hard. Like come the fuck on
[4:14:54] <+skyheys> maybe the control layout/responsiveness is bad
[4:14:58] <RyuuAoi> Billy is in the next room. They are still roommates..
[4:15:07] <+skyheys> but the layout is fine
[4:15:09] <Picia000123> O just really hope that whatever is at the end here is worth it
[4:15:09] <Milo_Oda> it didnt feel like i did it right when i finally made it
[4:15:15] <@SoushinSen> nah we're not roommates anymore.
[4:15:17] <+QueequegTheater> @Magoloso The challenge area is bad because the camera ruined it
[4:15:33] <%CaptainPileDriver> i mean, the camera is zoomed out and yeah, you do an area over and over again to leanr it.
[4:15:47] <Magoloso> @SoushinSen But you are still Roomates of the heart <3
[4:15:47] <+QueequegTheater> It's a cool area that becomes annoying because the camera is making it way harder to complete
[4:15:56] <+skyheys> the problem is the assets are so huge by default that zooming out more might hurt visibility ok f Ajna
[4:15:57] <HolisticField> oh my god they were roommates...
[4:15:59] <+JingKaisean> for sekiro, can Minh just finish it for woolie?
[4:16:07] <RyuuAoi> @soushinsen YES you are Kappa
[4:16:19] <Picia000123> Oh boy, were in here for the long haul
[4:16:20] <+QueequegTheater> @CaptainPileDriver The camera isn't zoomed out far enough to see oncoming obstacles tho
[4:16:26] <RyuuAoi> @holisticfield Long ago....in a galaxy far far away...
[4:16:29] <@SoushinSen> that would just get viewers to all make fun of woolie @JingKaisean
[4:16:30] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @jingkaisean I forgot Woolie was even LPing Sekiro lol
[4:16:44] <+QueequegTheater> @abelincoln_catpuncher He's not anymore
[4:16:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> how far out does it need to be zoomed
[4:16:47] <Magoloso> It's a win win
[4:16:51] <+JingKaisean> ok so no different than now
[4:16:56] <+skyheys> the better solution would be to make things smaller/make Ajna not move as far.
[4:17:02] <abelincoln_catpuncher> oooof
[4:17:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> cause it's already far out and this is a short challenge
[4:17:12] <SleepyMaribo> woolie ima save you some frustration by telling you your spear only attaches to the area thats sparkling.
[4:17:14] <+QueequegTheater> @CaptainPileDriver Far enough that she stays on screen at all times
[4:17:14] <RyuuAoi> Camera is still doe...
[4:17:29] <+Wild_Samurai> We need Woolie plays Sands of Time for a decompression game. That’s olatforming with a flow to it
[4:17:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> the only time is this first area where you're going up
[4:17:40] <RyuuAoi> Billy, get over there!
[4:17:43] <+JeluxDaCasual> Gotta stick the sparkle area Woolz
[4:17:46] <Milo_Oda> this song grades the ears pretty quick eh
[4:17:49] <@Solidus_113> MikeZ are you watching?
[4:17:50] <SixthSun2> YEah, make sure you're spearing the sparkling area
[4:17:55] <@Solidus_113> Do you see what you've done
[4:17:58] <+JeluxDaCasual> Drift left for ceiling collision
[4:18:14] <+JeluxDaCasual> Nah, sound slaps
[4:18:14] <HolisticField> ceiling mike is watching you whine
[4:18:14] <@SoushinSen> to get the ceiling, the sparkling isn't required.
[4:18:16] <%CaptainPileDriver> this game does have some big flaws though honestly, i still love it though.
[4:18:18] <+JeluxDaCasual> song* slaps
[4:18:25] <SleepyMaribo> because for whatever reason Mike Z decided to not make the entire ceiling attachable...
[4:18:28] <@SoushinSen> the sparkling is just there as a visual cue to where to go
[4:18:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> no, you might be fine
[4:18:59] <%CaptainPileDriver> to early
[4:19:04] <RyuuAoi> Woolie bout to Hulk up!
[4:19:04] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:19:11] <%gatorafan> Oh yeah, Woolie finished Celeste right? I still have to play that one.
[4:19:11] <HolisticField> just press it at the right time
[4:19:20] <Bobato_Chaps> just don't hit the spikes 4Head
[4:19:21] <SixthSun2> Remember Woolie, sparkling ceiling
[4:19:34] <@SoushinSen> sparkling ceiling is not required.
[4:19:34] <abelincoln_catpuncher> yeah Woolie just be perfect and never make mistakes
[4:19:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> @HolisticField that's the problem, the timing is weird
[4:19:39] <SleepyMaribo> you dont truly finish Celeste until you complete Farewell, which you cant do if you cant clear all the B sides
[4:19:41] <Magoloso> Celeste is tight as hell, play that one
[4:20:12] <%CaptainPileDriver> honestly, just plat shovel knight after this. it'll make you feel better.
[4:20:31] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's fine
[4:20:35] <vVAstrAVv> king of cards is big fun lol
[4:20:38] <SixthSun2> Whew, saved
[4:20:41] <PluckyLuck> Nice save
[4:20:42] <SPKTR34> game looks kinda rough, is the rest of it like this?
[4:20:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> @SPKTR34 no, this is the challenge area.
[4:21:11] <+QueequegTheater> @SPKTR34 I really wish, but no
[4:21:21] <HolisticField> Hey!
[4:21:22] <+DiabloDeAzul> Woolie isn't using yellow after smashing the 1st ball
[4:21:23] <@Solidus_113> super secret zone for masochists
[4:21:24] <vVAstrAVv> dont think feel
[4:21:27] <+QueequegTheater> H E Y
[4:21:29] <thunderhog> @WoolieVersus You have to uppercut the bottom spikeball. You lose your side axe right before you do down axe
[4:21:38] <abelincoln_catpuncher> use the heart of the cards, Woolie!
[4:21:40] <RyuuAoi> @spktr34 Not at a
[4:21:44] <Magoloso> woolieDATTEBAYO
[4:21:44] <RyuuAoi> All
[4:21:47] <SleepyMaribo> hey at least its not Cave Story bad, who here actually finished Hell?
[4:21:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> yes, uppercut the ball after you down axe
[4:21:58] <SleepyMaribo> aka palace of blood
[4:21:58] <+ConLin_Arts_> I never beat hell
[4:22:05] <Picia000123> ooofff
[4:22:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> uppercut that, gotta move to upper cut like @thunderhog said
[4:22:12] <Magoloso> @SleepyMaribo Fuuuuuuuuuck that. Normal ending is fine by me
[4:22:15] <%KoyFoster> Take 5 if you must
[4:22:24] <thunderhog> You lose your side axe right before do your down axe, so you have to dash UNDER and UPPERCUT
[4:22:31] <@Solidus_113> you gotta wait a little longer and dash directly underneath that spikeball
[4:22:42] <+enickma11> @SleepyMaribo That was the hardest shit I've ever had to do. All of that and THEN Ballos
[4:22:44] <+ConLin_Arts_> I think one of the few "challenging" things in a game I managed to beat was the final level in Rayman Origins
[4:22:49] <SleepyMaribo> dude palace of blood wouldnt be so bad if it wasnt a 15 minute boss rush with instant death spikes substituted for the entire floor.
[4:22:54] <RyuuAoi> Drink some water, @woolieversus! Take a breather. You missed 4:20!
[4:22:57] <vVAstrAVv> i think woolies in that downward spiral we all get into right now
[4:22:58] <%KoyFoster> It's cool I hate my hands too sometimes.
[4:23:24] <Picia000123> So, this is gonna get cut from the LP, right?
[4:23:25] <+Wild_Samurai> Someone call in Yooka and laylee to complete this impossible lair
[4:23:31] <+QueequegTheater> @Picia000123 oh yeah
[4:23:32] <HolisticField> BlessRNG
[4:23:44] <Magoloso> Use the force, Woolz
[4:23:45] <abelincoln_catpuncher> Will Woolie figure it out? Find out, on the next episode of Castle Super Beast!
[4:23:46] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus You gotta uppercut
[4:23:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> @WoolieVersus UPPERCUT there
[4:23:49] <thunderhog> Yeah its gone. you have to upper
[4:23:56] <@Solidus_113> <- <- V <- ^
[4:23:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> yes
[4:24:02] <Magoloso> UPPER
[4:24:03] <@Solidus_113> Uppoercut from underneath
[4:24:06] <+jiggy_snipe> he's getting it at least
[4:24:08] <RyuuAoi> Yeah I don't even know....
[4:24:09] <vVAstrAVv> dont dashes come back when he breaks the balls?
[4:24:10] <+ConLin_Arts_> also me and my friend has beaten ToeJam and Earl on the random mode trice, it gets real hectic towards the end
[4:24:11] <+QueequegTheater> Do a flash kick
[4:24:16] <Darkyello> woolie can you pogo stick the floor spikes?
[4:24:21] <+ConLin_Arts_> nope
[4:24:23] <%KoyFoster> I can't remember how to did this, but I don't remember that part being a huge problem. It's the part right after that, that confused me.
[4:24:23] <PluckyLuck> Undercut from upperneath
[4:24:24] <@Solidus_113> no
[4:24:32] <+JeluxDaCasual> Axe dash, drift and pogo?
[4:24:39] <Darkyello> what about the flower arrow?
[4:24:41] <@Solidus_113> can't pogo the spirals
[4:24:41] <RyuuAoi> @darkyello YO. WORTH A SHOT
[4:24:42] <HolisticField> AUGH
[4:24:43] <SleepyMaribo> cant pogo on any f these spikes
[4:24:44] <@Solidus_113> they're magic
[4:24:48] <+JeluxDaCasual> curses
[4:24:58] <vVAstrAVv> i think woolie really wants to use that up
[4:25:00] <RedPanda25> Magic spirals
[4:25:17] <RedPanda25> Itou reference
[4:25:25] <@Solidus_113> This is the true Spiral Energy
[4:25:26] <+ConLin_Arts_> One day I want to beat Lingering Will in KH2 Final Mix legit, but man is that lad hard to beat
[4:25:27] <%CaptainPileDriver> gotta axe dash after that
[4:25:34] <+QueequegTheater> Axe dash
[4:25:36] <@Solidus_113> Uppercut DI to axe DI
[4:25:41] <+aishman> Axe Dashes are the only thing that refresh
[4:25:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> what solidus says
[4:25:52] <+QueequegTheater> Cancel dash super into arson super
[4:25:59] <thunderhog> @WoolieVersus The rule is you refresh the Axe dash if you land a hit with it. If you land ANY axe dash hit you refresh your normal dash
[4:25:59] <Magoloso> Axe dashes my guy
[4:26:00] <jase__x> This game doesnt really do a great job teaching what yuo can and cant do.
[4:26:04] <RyuuAoi> Anyone in chat beat this?
[4:26:06] <+aishman> All of them axe dashes my dude
[4:26:06] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:26:07] <@Solidus_113> I did
[4:26:07] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Your thumb must be hurting from this too. Mine was
[4:26:07] <+Wild_Samurai> *blinks loudly*
[4:26:08] <%CaptainPileDriver> yes
[4:26:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> i beat it
[4:26:15] <+JeluxDaCasual> Axe Dash
[4:26:16] <HolisticField> i made this :)
[4:26:19] <+JeluxDaCasual> you get Axe Dash back
[4:26:26] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @conlin_arts_ oh god I getting war flashbacks thinking about his curse effect into Ars Solum
[4:26:26] <thunderhog> @WoolieVersus Also it refreshs the SPECIFIC axe dash. So you refresh upper with upper and side with side
[4:26:27] <+aishman> You just get Axe dashes
[4:26:27] <RyuuAoi> @solidus_113 GOD TIER
[4:26:32] <%CaptainPileDriver> it took awhile cause
[4:26:36] <@SoushinSen> i beat it, blinded folded, without touching the controller.
[4:26:37] <%CaptainPileDriver> timing is weird
[4:26:40] <Haarute> i think you only get the axe dash that you used (so the up one) but you get regular dash.
[4:26:43] <$SilverRoddo> Axe cancel into uppercut.
[4:27:04] <+FrostedZaibatsu> @HolisticField How could you hggConfused
[4:27:16] <RyuuAoi> @soushinsen EYE believe you, Billy! Like Contra!
[4:27:16] <%CaptainPileDriver> no, you gotta axe upper into side into down during the last part
[4:27:19] <thunderhog> @WoolieVersus Look and what doing side axe, upper, and side does
[4:27:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> you can
[4:27:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's hard as fuck
[4:27:27] <@Solidus_113> uppercut (DI up-left), yellow dash up-left, axe down DI up-left
[4:27:35] <HolisticField> @FrostedZaibatsu i used unity engine
[4:27:39] <%CaptainPileDriver> uppercut (DI up-left), yellow dash up-left, axe down DI up-left what solidus said
[4:27:47] <%LordSDB> Does flowers not work here?
[4:27:52] <@Solidus_113> nope
[4:28:02] <@Solidus_113> you get another dash up
[4:28:08] <%KoyFoster> Upper cut again?
[4:28:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> you get another dash woolie
[4:28:16] <+QueequegTheater> @HolisticField I hope someone else came up with using the exact same name as the Hollow Knight version
[4:28:17] <+JeluxDaCasual> upper cut again Woolz!!
[4:28:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> you upper again
[4:28:27] <SomersaultJustice> do do do do do do dododo do do do blallalg
[4:28:28] <%KoyFoster> Yeyeyeyeyye
[4:28:29] <@Solidus_113> correct
[4:28:32] <HolisticField> no i named this :)
[4:28:32] <+JeluxDaCasual> Uppercut Again!!
[4:28:37] <%KoyFoster> He's doing it
[4:28:37] <SixthSun2> It could be neat if there was visual indicators for what air dashes you have
[4:28:40] <+Grayhammatter> yes, so you uppercut again?
[4:28:41] <RyuuAoi> WOOLIE WILL FIGURE IT OUT
[4:28:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> it is
[4:28:46] <RyuuAoi> TakeNRG
[4:28:49] <Magoloso> WOOLIE IS FIGURING IT OUT
[4:28:51] <+JeluxDaCasual> Uppercut again Woolz!!
[4:28:55] <%KoyFoster> @RyuuAoi Lmao
[4:29:11] <%CaptainPileDriver> challenge area because fuck you
[4:29:12] <Magoloso> A fucking movelist would be the beeeest thing here
[4:29:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> get good is the theme of this area
[4:29:22] <+QueequegTheater> @HolisticField But it's literally the exact same type of challenge, with the same hidden entrance, and the same name. That's bordering on the legal definition of plagiarism
[4:29:25] <thunderhog> Woolie has figured it out
[4:29:25] <@Solidus_113> imagine explaining game mechanics
[4:29:25] <RyuuAoi> Everyone, put your hands in the air and send @woolieversus your energy!
[4:29:29] <SleepyMaribo> nah but Mike dont like movelists
[4:29:37] <HolisticField> oops :)
[4:29:43] <jase__x> movelists are for scrubs says Mike
[4:29:47] <Aussie_Manny> Celeste WHO?
[4:29:51] <+Grayhammatter> something like circles denotating what you have used and what you still have would be nice
[4:30:02] <+JeluxDaCasual> lol, just learn her moves tho
[4:30:03] <abelincoln_catpuncher> I love a lot of this game, but its stuff like this that really burns my soul
[4:30:03] <TheDr0t> hello there
[4:30:07] <TigerClaws12> lobosKek
[4:30:07] <%CaptainPileDriver> just cut literally all of the challenges
[4:30:07] <Aussie_Manny> MINH! CUT THIS SHIT!
[4:30:07] <+JeluxDaCasual> She has way too many.
[4:30:12] <Picia000123> OH YEAH
[4:30:12] <+QueequegTheater> Props for creating the best area in the game by far @HolisticField but I'm really kind of shocked at how brazen that kind of theft is
[4:30:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> just cut right to the boss honestly.
[4:30:18] <@SoushinSen> not cutting anything.
[4:30:20] <@Solidus_113> we got 2 episodes out of this
[4:30:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> why
[4:30:22] <@SoushinSen> except onions

[4:30:45] <RyuuAoi> Keep it all, Billy. The people know what they showed up for!
[4:30:46] <+JeluxDaCasual> lol, leave it ALL in!
[4:30:52] <+Grayhammatter> lul
[4:30:54] <+Wild_Samurai> U gotta connect to the chiral network to see the other platforms
[4:30:57] <thunderhog> I can't wait for the hour long part of endless trial and error
[4:30:58] <%Lion_kun> Minh should just fastforward the footage
[4:30:59] <$SilverRoddo> This will be it’s own episode.
[4:31:05] <%Lion_kun> Keep all the fail in

[4:31:23] <PluckyLuck> Only edit in the successful attempt then claim 1st try. I wont tell.
[4:31:27] <thunderhog> @aishman He loses side axe by recovering from the first one, so he HAS to upper
[4:31:27] <+aishman> Oh right
[4:31:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> gotta do two uppers then a normal doash tehn down
[4:31:34] <+jiggy_snipe> then we can hear this song sped up lol

[4:33:11] <%CaptainPileDriver> if you lose the boss fight
[4:33:15] <$SilverRoddo> idclip
[4:33:16] <+JeluxDaCasual> No....
[4:33:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> you have to redo the ENTIRE THING AGAIN
[4:33:19] <Picia000123> is this the vvvvvv for Woolie?
[4:33:20] <HolisticField> all this salt woolie better rehydrate after this
[4:33:21] <+JeluxDaCasual> Captain NO.....
[4:33:21] <@Solidus_113> I don't think that's true Cap
[4:33:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> all of this
[4:33:34] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> i hope he loses the boss fight then
[4:33:36] <%KoyFoster> You had it
[4:33:38] <faeron93> thats too much bs
[4:33:40] <PluckyLuck> Good!
[4:33:42] <vVAstrAVv> what happened to that long red daah that curves upward near the end?
[4:33:42] <SleepyMaribo> @CaptainPileDriver wait wut? i killed it in one go, but does it seriously send you all the way back if you die?
[4:33:46] <jase__x> if that was the case then this would be even worstr
[4:33:49] <sugarveins> Damn Woolie
[4:34:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> @SleepyMaribo i did this before the final upgrade and the sidequests
[4:34:04] <UnfilteredComic> Also bullshit
[4:34:07] <%CaptainPileDriver> trust me.
[4:34:08] <@Solidus_113> The fight is a fuck
[4:34:08] <$SilverRoddo> What is this, a Bleetz Bol arena?
[4:34:09] <abelincoln_catpuncher> bahahahahaha
[4:34:16] <abelincoln_catpuncher> he asked about the cat fight
[4:34:21] <+MrRabbles> snatching defeat from the jaws of victory
[4:34:21] <RyuuAoi> BegWan
[4:34:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> but with the final upgrade and the sidequests done
[4:34:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> this fight is a cake walk
[4:34:32] <@Solidus_113> not really
[4:34:34] <%gatorafan> I kinda wish Woolie had kidnapped Eyepatch Wolf and forced him to play a game live here. daedra1DerpyTibs
[4:34:35] <+xx123manxx> Lab 0 thought on fun
[4:34:38] <jase__x> Woolie abut to pull out his dreads
[4:34:41] <Magoloso> IKEEEEEE
[4:34:52] <UnfilteredComic> Agh it hurts
[4:34:54] <abelincoln_catpuncher> Nooooooooo
[4:34:58] <@Solidus_113> yellow was straight left
[4:34:59] <+jkobe34> yellow after the the up
[4:35:02] <+aishman> You can uppercut more to the left
[4:35:07] <%CaptainPileDriver> idk, i beat it on my first try after i did all of itcause damage output was increased
[4:35:10] <Haarute> up and then dash, not the other way around
[4:35:13] <Picia000123> So, this is Woolie's Top 5 of all time, right? Kappa
[4:35:16] <RyuuAoi> YOU FUCKING GOT THIS, WOOLIE
[4:35:23] <+JeluxDaCasual> DI
[4:35:25] <HolisticField> just hex the cat
[4:35:26] <SixthSun2> You can fall forward more
[4:35:28] <%KoyFoster> upper left give you more air time
[4:35:29] <@Solidus_113> you need more air for the down axe to DI into the end
[4:35:30] <UnfilteredComic> The DI
[4:35:30] <+JeluxDaCasual> up left for that sweet sweet DI
[4:35:42] <%CaptainPileDriver> plus, with 7 bars and kampan's super
[4:35:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> you do fucking damage
[4:35:49] <Haarute> thank you reggie
[4:36:08] <+QueequegTheater> @CaptainPileDriver He's not using Kampan
[4:36:16] <+aishman> Is this the worst it's been?
[4:36:18] <+Wild_Samurai> We need a “horizontality” emote
[4:36:24] <%CaptainPileDriver> he should, her super literally takes out entire health bars in this fight which helps
[4:36:30] <+Superbro64> Imagine it's a baiken combo trial woolie 4Head
[4:36:32] <+QueequegTheater> Human Horizontality Project
[4:36:32] <Magoloso> I have homework, but I need Woolz to beat this
[4:36:33] <%LordSDB> Can he not super dash that one after the fall going left or did he not have another left/right dash after that?
[4:36:34] <+Superbro64> evening chat
[4:36:39] <faeron93> BlessRNG BlessRNG BlessRNG
[4:36:42] <@Solidus_113> yes
[4:36:48] <%LordSDB> yo superbro
[4:36:51] <+QueequegTheater> @CaptainPileDriver When has Woolie literally EVER gone substance over style tho
[4:36:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> and once you start getting to the other health bars she starts doing at least 30% then later at LEAST 20
[4:36:59] <+JeluxDaCasual> sbfpGou sbfpGi
[4:37:02] <%CaptainPileDriver> and you can style into though
[4:37:04] <+Superbro64> @lordsdb doodBro
[4:37:05] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Think of having to be able to speak properly while doing this LUL
[4:37:07] <%CaptainPileDriver> combo into it and it's amazing
[4:37:23] <+QueequegTheater> UGH
[4:37:58] <Magoloso> RAWR
[4:38:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> this just makes me want to do that fight again but once you beat the game, you go right into new game plus, still have my old saves i think
[4:38:11] <mankeyfigh> oh lordy, i just got here, how long have they been doing this
[4:38:16] <jase__x> HahaThink
[4:38:17] <+Superbro64> reminds me of the suffering of learning sol dust loops in xrd NotLikeThis
[4:38:21] <%CaptainPileDriver> @mankeyfigh so long.
[4:38:22] <Picia000123> @mankeyfigh Too long
[4:38:23] <+JeluxDaCasual> and episode
[4:38:25] <+QueequegTheater> @mankeyfigh about 20ish minutes
[4:38:28] <+Dio_Goodguy> is this game a 7
[4:38:30] <+Superbro64> pity dust loops arent even in strive as of our knowledge
[4:38:31] <+JeluxDaCasual> and episode's worth of time.
[4:38:38] <Magoloso> @mankeyfigh Enough for me to cook pasta and eat it
[4:38:40] <mankeyfigh> DAAAAMN
[4:38:46] <+JeluxDaCasual> literally gonna be Indivisible part 47-5
[4:38:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> @Dio_Goodguy i would personally say it's an 8 but don't blame anyone for not liking it
[4:38:52] <Picia000123> @Dio_Goodguy I would give it between 5-6 but idk
[4:38:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> this is just a challenge area that's hard as shit.
[4:38:59] <@Solidus_113> it's like a 6.5
[4:39:08] <vVAstrAVv> weeeeell im gonna play divinity 2 till he beats this lol
[4:39:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> i understand that
[4:39:11] <%KoyFoster> Not even as hard as the boss.
[4:39:15] <Magoloso> I land on a hard 7. I really like the art
[4:39:18] <@Solidus_113> after all the content gets added maybe it'll be a 7.5
[4:39:18] <+QueequegTheater> @CaptainPileDriver It's also probably the best area in the game
[4:39:19] <mankeyfigh> this... this actually took me two tries and five minutes...
[4:39:27] <%CaptainPileDriver> is it?
[4:39:30] <CyberShinryu> Should I buy this?
[4:39:30] <UnfilteredComic> I didthat a lot, you can do it woolie!
[4:39:32] <+QueequegTheater> Easily
[4:39:39] <%LordSDB> What happened there? Why did he reset
[4:39:41] <Picia000123> The art and designs really carry this game
[4:39:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> @CyberShinryu depends, do you like combos and story and art
[4:39:48] <+QueequegTheater> It's the only area that requires any actual platforming skill
[4:39:49] <+JeluxDaCasual> held dash instead of tap
[4:39:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> otherwise no
[4:39:54] <Picia000123> it's all so superficial though
[4:39:57] <Magoloso> The voice acting is also really cool
[4:40:09] <+Grayhammatter> damn, a little too shallow
[4:40:13] <%KoyFoster> @CyberShinryu If you like platformers and new experiences.
[4:40:13] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:40:15] <+QueequegTheater> @CyberShinryu He's also wrong about the story
[4:40:16] <%CaptainPileDriver> idk, i like the story and art and the combat system a lot
[4:40:29] <$SilverRoddo> He’s starting to believe.
[4:40:34] <SixthSun2> No button is the worst possible button to hold
[4:40:35] <+QueequegTheater> The story is like the most basic generic JRPG story I've ever seen
[4:40:41] <%CaptainPileDriver> the story is fine
[4:40:50] <Haarute> @CaptainPileDriver that's okay man, i enjoyed the story too.
[4:40:52] <SomersaultJustice> is there a way to fall from the spear part and bypass that whole corner section entirely?
[4:41:03] <Magoloso> Story is ok. Not every game is KOTOR 2
[4:41:03] <%CaptainPileDriver> gotta DI further
[4:41:04] <@Solidus_113> that's the way
[4:41:05] <HolisticField> wait on the swing
[4:41:06] <+QueequegTheater> The game itself doens't even give a shit about the story
[4:41:07] <UnfilteredComic> Axed too early
[4:41:08] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Thots?
[4:41:10] <@Solidus_113> you just gotta get it perfect
[4:41:15] <Picia000123> The story could be told way better, but I can get it if someone likes it
[4:41:19] <+DiabloDeAzul> go straight left?
[4:41:23] <Haarute> dash after the uppercuts to gain air momentum?
[4:41:24] <SixthSun2> More airtime before axe
[4:41:24] <+theotherkristian> When did you start playing Celeste wtf is this!?!
[4:41:26] <+BallerSwagBro9k> IMPROVISE ADAPT OVERCOME
[4:41:28] <Picia000123> It just goes WAY too fast
[4:41:28] <%CaptainPileDriver> it can be, i just enjoyed the simple story
[4:41:32] <sphereshots12> These hitboxes are some bs
[4:41:33] <+MrRabbles> story is the most basic saturday morning cartoon i've ever seen and that's ok
[4:41:34] <Aussie_Manny> ROW ROW
[4:41:35] <%LordSDB> Axe too early, drift a bit more left than axe
[4:41:41] <+JeluxDaCasual> just gotta get closer when you Up-dash that last spike
[4:41:45] <+Wild_Samurai> If this game were a Pokemon it would be a Mankey
[4:42:02] <Picia000123> @Wild_Samurai Alright, let's not be crazy here
[4:42:03] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus So when's the Heartgold Nuzlocke LP
[4:42:16] <%CaptainPileDriver> get out
[4:42:19] <+QueequegTheater> no
[4:42:21] <Aussie_Manny> @QueequegTheater PogChamp
[4:42:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> i'm not sitting through another one of those
[4:42:31] <+QueequegTheater> Gen 2 remake are the best pokemon games
[4:42:32] <+Declan_8000> What have I walked back in to
[4:42:35] <+Wild_Samurai> Definitely not a prime ape though
[4:42:36] <%LordSDB> I'd watch it....
[4:42:41] <HolisticField> if this game were a flavour of ice cream it'd be strawberry
[4:42:41] <Magoloso> YOOOOO
[4:42:44] <SixthSun2> LIES
[4:42:46] <SomersaultJustice> DOITAGAIN
[4:42:47] <UnfilteredComic> Thats it
[4:42:47] <Picia000123> HAHAHA
[4:42:48] <+Grayhammatter> LIES
[4:42:49] <Haarute> last second swing
[4:42:49] <%gatorafan> Woolie playing anything that's not Gen1 daedra1LaughingTibs

[4:43:00] <Magoloso> YOU CAN DO IT WOOLZ
[4:43:01] <sosuke5> Just do it perfectly first time 4Head
[4:43:10] <Picia000123> Gotta look for tthe second swallow
[4:43:13] <UnfilteredComic> Too early

[4:43:18] <%KoyFoster> Way to early on the slam
[4:43:19] <+Grayhammatter> too early
[4:43:22] <%KoyFoster> too*
[4:43:24] <+TheRealMasterof7s> Way too early
[4:43:25] <$SilverRoddo> This Mario Maker puzzle, over here.
[4:43:28] <%CaptainPileDriver> gotta save the dash and axe for JUST the right time
[4:43:30] <pistofficer> this gane sure looks likme a blast lol
[4:43:32] <%LordSDB> He got this woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[4:43:33] <%gatorafan> He's beginning to BELIEVE! daedra1DerpyTibs
[4:43:39] <Magoloso> IKEEEEE!
[4:43:40] <HolisticField> ARE YOU HAVING FUN YET??
[4:43:47] <Magoloso> nope
[4:43:49] <@Solidus_113> You could delay each of the dashes across the spikes just a bit to get the slightest bit more air control leftwards
[4:43:52] <mankeyfigh> So we all know Woolie and Eyepatch filmed some Gon content at MAGfest right? Or is that just me...
[4:43:56] <%KoyFoster> @pistofficer This is the only challenging part of the game.
[4:43:59] <+Dio_Goodguy> this section doesn't seem very fun
[4:44:07] <Kiraklene> !MOTIVATED

[4:44:42] <@Solidus_113> no
[4:44:44] <+MrRabbles> this is optional

[4:51:49] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @thunderhog

[4:51:51] <Picia000123> Alright, there is something
[4:51:54] <derap41> Fuck this cat sound is driving me nuts
[4:51:55] <+QueequegTheater> @FrostedZaibatsu And he kept burning meter at 2 bars
[4:51:56] <+ConLin_Arts_> Remember, Lab Zero only did Skullgirls before this! I still like it even with its hiccups!
[4:51:58] <+BallerSwagBro9k> IZUNYAN DROPS
[4:51:58] <thunderhog> Of course Mikes cat has command grabs
[4:51:59] <+Grayhammatter> ya played yourself
[4:52:00] <abelincoln_catpuncher> omfg hes gonna do this all over again
[4:52:02] <thunderhog> He's a tager main
[4:52:05] <Magoloso> use that feminine dick!
[4:52:09] <@Solidus_113> all 7
[4:52:16] <UnfilteredComic> all 7 even if shes dead
[4:52:16] <Andrei11Droasca> RIP
[4:52:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> he needs all 7
[4:52:17] <badmr7> the cat dunked 'em
[4:52:17] <+TheRealMasterof7s> FULL METER FOR REVIVE
[4:52:20] <+enickma11> Nah you just need full meter
[4:52:21] <Picia000123> This is so bad
[4:52:21] <Haarute> ajna can while dead but you need full bar.
[4:52:25] <solidoutlaw> yeah you need a full stick of butter for that revive
[4:52:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> even if she's dead, just needs full meter
[4:52:30] <Magoloso> It's the killer, do not die
[4:52:30] <solidoutlaw> even if ajna is down
[4:52:40] <%CaptainPileDriver> just build it
[4:52:43] <+Declan_8000> Just 3 bars for revive
[4:52:45] <Picia000123> the izuna drop was cool though
[4:53:01] <@Solidus_113> don't use group block as it drains meter
[4:53:02] <hassanico2> Yo I gave up during the platforming bit, why's Kushi in the party now?
[4:53:03] <+xx123manxx> Man chain sickles are the coolest thing
[4:53:06] <RyuuAoi> MEOW
[4:53:13] <solidoutlaw> I failed to beat this boss but I found that it was better to hoard the meter for a revive rather than spend it on supers, especially since the boss doesn't get super difficult until like the 5th life
[4:53:20] <Picia000123> Fucking Axl Low in this bitch
[4:53:26] <UnfilteredComic> 1 more?
[4:53:33] <%Lion_kun> is this 8 or 9?
[4:53:39] <@Solidus_113> 5?

[4:54:03] <DSD24> That had no windup
[4:54:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> the only character to use super on in this fight is kampan because 7 bars and her super equalseither full bar kill in the early lives or 20-30 percent in the later lives
[4:54:05] <Picia000123> Oh boy we about to do this all over again
[4:54:10] <HolisticField> idk dude

[4:55:13] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @woolieversus my dude, you gotta gotta gotta use the traps. they save you a lot of trouble
[4:55:13] <%Lion_kun> WAIT
[4:55:14] <Magoloso> Best girl is here

[4:55:15] <%CaptainPileDriver> LEVEL 7 SUPER DOES DAMAGE

[4:55:58] <%LordSDB> 1
[4:55:58] <+Grayhammatter> this is already going better
[4:55:59] <%Lion_kun> I thought Woolie was gonna have to do the platforming shit again
[4:56:01] <+machinetoys> what's max level?
[4:56:03] <ficboyog> oh no more meows !
[4:56:03] <+TheRealMasterof7s> Combos are worthless in this fight. This is about damage and crowd control
[4:56:09] <Magoloso> She is so fucking cool
[4:56:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> max level is a ton of damage is what it is
[4:56:17] <Haarute> you can do a lvl 7 now if you want
[4:56:19] <+QueequegTheater> @TheRealMasterof7s But it's woolie tho
[4:56:19] <Magoloso> I wonder if her arm is her wife?
[4:56:26] <%TubeMan642> woolieSHOOK_TK
[4:56:28] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @therealmasterof7s not really since combos build meter
[4:56:31] <@Solidus_113> Ren's supers for burn/poison help a bit
[4:56:39] <%LordSDB> 2
[4:56:42] <HolisticField> @Magoloso guess she likes gettinf fisted
[4:56:49] <%KoyFoster> My team for this fight was Ajna, Razmi, Punch Girl, and Bard Lady.
[4:57:01] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Use Kampan's level 7
[4:57:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> my team was phoebe kampan and honey cause honey does the meter gain and i can combo off the uppercut with kampan with the air back breaker with phoebe
[4:57:17] <+TheRealMasterof7s> @abelincoln_catpuncher Gindeng is building meter by themselves
[4:57:18] <@Solidus_113> you only get 1 trap with ren at a time
[4:57:20] <SuperChumps> I cannot remember, did @WoolieVersus ever play KOTOR2 back in the day with Pat?
[4:57:21] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's not that big, the best trap user is nuna cause that shit has a wide hitbox
[4:57:25] <@Solidus_113> if you set another it deletes the last
[4:57:28] <Hammatime8> I have less than 0 experience with this game. My blinf guess is that this is a secret boss?
[4:57:31] <@Solidus_113> unless it's a super
[4:57:32] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @superchumps nope
[4:57:43] <%LordSDB> 3
[4:58:01] <%CaptainPileDriver> save up your attaks and do super with kampan cause fuck
[4:58:05] <+enickma11> Throw away that meter on Kampan's level 7 super LUL
[4:58:06] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @therealmasterof7s true but... more meter

[4:58:42] <+QueequegTheater> What if he needs the meter for a different fight tho
[4:58:55] <thunderhog> Mike's cat is also in skull girls as a sort of error thing involving fuuka
[4:58:57] <%LordSDB> 4
[4:59:06] <%CaptainPileDriver> he needs to use that meter to start doing damage later
[4:59:07] <@Solidus_113> You can use Ren's lvl 1 for stuff
[4:59:11] <RyuuAoi> Woolie won
[4:59:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> plus this team has decent iddhi gain

[5:05:53] <%Lion_kun> that was not worth it
[5:05:55] <Haarute> kampan also has one
[5:05:57] <@Solidus_113> I think you had to press buttons

[5:06:06] <badmr7> Kampan's level 7 mash that shit
[5:06:08] <thunderhog> @WoolieVersus Kappan uses all your meter so it's technically a level 7
[5:06:09] <+QueequegTheater> @Magoloso Dhar isn't here
[5:06:14] <HolisticField> iddhi is for punch girls

[5:06:28] <abelincoln_catpuncher> for dating someone named Punch Mom, Woolie does not utilize Kampan well lol
[5:06:31] <%CaptainPileDriver> lol, get that meter back and health with honey
[5:06:32] <+MrRabbles> very cool move
[5:06:32] <Picia000123> DONT FUCKING LOSE NOW

[5:10:30] <DSD24> @jorniev He died
[5:10:31] <%KoyFoster> Go talk to MikeZ.
[5:10:32] <+RealThiele> the cats you killed along the way
[5:10:32] <SirDogBear> woolie going genocide run BibleThump
[5:10:32] <NarcissistCactus> the reward is winning

[5:10:35] <jorniev> WHAT
[5:10:37] <thewoolieholeofdavidcage> woolie keeping the lore of hurting animals lol
[5:10:37] <Magoloso> WE ALL SAW IT WOOLIE
[5:10:38] <SomersaultJustice> no pride, only prejudice
[5:10:38] <%CaptainPileDriver> you go back and talk to mikez in game and says new dialogue
[5:10:42] <+aishman> Did Woolie beat the cat?
[5:10:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> then fades into nothing
[5:10:46] <ficboyog> wth you get nothing??????
[5:10:46] <hassanico2> There's no equipment, no skills, what kinda reward would you evven get?
[5:10:46] <Magoloso> we all know you did it!
[5:10:49] <thunderhog> Mike Z in tai krung will say shit
[5:10:50] <@Solidus_113> Now make your way back up the fucking mountain and get the teleport
[5:10:53] <jorniev> f
[5:10:58] <%LordSDB> @aishman Yeah
[5:10:59] <%CaptainPileDriver> IT'S NOT WORTH IT
[5:11:01] <+ConLin_Arts_> there aren't really equipment in this game
[5:11:02] <+QueequegTheater> @WoolieVersus Hollow Knight's significantly harder platforming challenge (also called path of pain which L0 stole for this game) also had no reward
[5:11:04] <jase__x> THATS THE WORST
[5:11:07] <Magoloso> DON'T DO IT
[5:11:14] <Picia000123> nice :)
[5:11:14] <+TheRealMasterof7s> You came though here already
[5:11:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> HE JUST SAYS YOU SURVIVED MY CAT THEN FADES OUT
[5:11:17] <RedPanda25> That's heart breaking
[5:11:34] <+ConLin_Arts_> a lot of games have had similar things Queegueg
[5:11:35] <Haarute> now you can fly though.
[5:11:40] <%CaptainPileDriver> yes
[5:11:40] <RedPanda25> Soul crushing
[5:11:44] <Andrei11Droasca> DO IT YOU PUSS
[5:11:44] <+Qsmash_> fun
[5:11:44] <@Solidus_113> you're going backwards
[5:11:48] <+ConLin_Arts_> Hollow Knight wasn't the first one
[5:11:49] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Yall shouldve kickstarted a reward hggLul
[5:11:51] <%CaptainPileDriver> just climb back up
[5:11:52] <thunderhog> @WoolieVersus The top is faster
[5:11:54] <jase__x> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[5:12:03] <Haarute> go to the endgame and teleport.
[5:12:09] <abelincoln_catpuncher> woolie
[5:12:09] <SirDogBear> not even a medal BibleThump
[5:12:09] <@Solidus_113> you're going completely the wrong direction
[5:12:11] <+TheRealMasterof7s> You're going backwards
[5:12:13] <+QueequegTheater> @ConLin_Arts_ Literally the exact same challenge, with the same broken tile entry, with the same name and the same lack of any reward?
[5:12:14] <abelincoln_catpuncher> why are you like this
[5:12:36] <+Qsmash_> @WoolieVersus You think the crossover characters will warrant a second playthrough?
[5:12:37] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's literally like 1 line of dialogue
[5:12:40] <%CaptainPileDriver> trust me
[5:12:41] <+QueequegTheater> There's similar and then there's plagiarism
[5:12:42] <+TheRealMasterof7s> just go up and hit thr teleporter
[5:12:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> what about plagerism
[5:13:02] <thunderhog> Woolie's been in cat hell for so long we forgot the map
[5:13:07] <RedPanda25> I would've just listened to lego yoda explain CBT for 9hrs then deal with that
[5:13:08] <thunderhog> Clockwork
[5:13:14] <abelincoln_catpuncher> bruh if you can plagiarize in games then like 80% of games we know nowadays wouldn't exist
[5:13:18] <@Solidus_113> at least you have your new power
[5:13:32] <+QueequegTheater> @CaptainPileDriver There's a difficult platforming challenge hidden behind a breakable wall with no tangible reward in Hollow Knight called the Path of Pain
[5:13:48] <+QueequegTheater> @abelincoln_catpuncher And 80% of games are bad
[5:13:56] <%CaptainPileDriver> i mean, i guess, but, again, it's probably just a nod to them
[5:13:58] <+ConLin_Arts_> LUL
[5:14:01] <Andrei11Droasca> It's 2 AM !? NotLikeThis
[5:14:18] <thunderhog> You live in europe?
[5:14:24] <%LordSDB> He must
[5:14:25] <Andrei11Droasca> Yep
[5:14:29] <+ConLin_Arts_> same
[5:14:36] <+QueequegTheater> @CaptainPileDriver I disagree. I know an IP lawyer, there's a difference between homages and nods and straight up ripping entire sections from other works
[5:14:39] <+ConLin_Arts_> it is 01:44am for me
[5:14:43] <+RealThiele> everything is deriviatve
[5:14:45] <+Superbro64> 3rd attempt chat? Or did he kill the cat?
[5:14:47] <abelincoln_catpuncher> like I get what you're saying but if you cant take ideas from other games then we'd never have FF, we wouldn't have Castlevania SOFT, or Hollow Knight
[5:14:47] <Picia000123> It.s 0:44 AM for me
[5:14:48] <Andrei11Droasca> Welp ,i didn't need sleep anyway
[5:14:53] <SleepyMaribo> told ya the fight was not worth it, dont even get a trophy or achievment for it.
[5:14:54] <+RealThiele> cat ded x9
[5:14:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> did they take assets and the exact same layout?
[5:15:16] <%LordSDB> Poor horse man
[5:15:19] <thunderhog> The ultimate woolie bait. Blanka balls
[5:15:20] <Picia000123> All of that for a drop of dialogue
[5:15:22] <+ConLin_Arts_> only similar access point name and no reward it seems
[5:15:22] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1210124488463077376
[5:15:28] <+QueequegTheater> @CaptainPileDriver Same name, same exact concept, and same exact method of entry. That's plagiarism
[5:15:33] <%CaptainPileDriver> that's not.
[5:15:41] <+ConLin_Arts_> was there a boss at the end of the Hollow Knight one?
[5:15:45] <Aruist> The game has enough flaws on it’s own, having a difficult platform section behind a hidden wall isn’t that big of a deal m8
[5:15:52] <UnfilteredComic> So did they fight kala yet?
[5:15:57] <+ConLin_Arts_> nope
[5:15:58] <thewoolieholeofdavidcage> no
[5:16:05] <UnfilteredComic> alright just checkin lol
[5:16:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> if they fought kala we'd be in new game plus
[5:16:14] <jorniev> wow this is some wierd shit i did not expect the game to get like this
[5:16:14] <+QueequegTheater> @ConLin_Arts_ There was a pair of tough enemies that could easily kill you and send you back to the start
[5:16:17] <abelincoln_catpuncher> yeah and I know a real estate agent it doesnt make me aware of current real estate laws lol
[5:16:20] <NullWinter0> It's beginning to look like the latter sections of Getting Over It.
[5:16:24] <Picia000123> We are god now for real
[5:16:31] <+ConLin_Arts_> but not a boss at the end
[5:16:35] <thunderhog> NICE
[5:16:41] <+QueequegTheater> @abelincoln_catpuncher I've spoken at great length with the lawyer about plagiarism, copyright, and patent laws
[5:16:44] <+RealThiele> LUL
[5:16:47] <Andrei11Droasca> Is this the end of the game ?
[5:16:47] <+ConLin_Arts_> LUL
[5:16:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's not plagiarism
[5:16:54] <%KoyFoster> It's time.
[5:16:56] <@Solidus_113> yes
[5:16:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> nope
[5:17:00] <Picia000123> please end this
[5:17:02] <thunderhog> So either Mike Z or FINISH GAME
[5:17:02] <+RealThiele> his uncle works at plagarism lawyer company
[5:17:05] <+QueequegTheater> If they had changed the name, it wouldn't be
[5:17:10] <UnfilteredComic> Just end it, MIKE Z is not worth it
[5:17:11] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's not
[5:17:15] <@Solidus_113> back to the teleporter and talk with Mike, or straight to the finale
[5:17:15] <%CaptainPileDriver> NO
[5:17:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> DON'T DO
[5:17:19] <%KoyFoster> Forget about MikeZ.
[5:17:19] <thunderhog> Nah FUCK MIKE
[5:17:21] <%CaptainPileDriver> FOR FUCKS SAKE
[5:17:23] <+QueequegTheater> DON'T DO IT
[5:17:25] <UnfilteredComic> FUCKTHAT GUY
[5:17:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> IT'S NOT
[5:17:29] <solidoutlaw> you might as well
[5:17:29] <%KoyFoster> Fuck that guy.
[5:17:30] <SomersaultJustice> YEAH DO IT
[5:17:31] <+BallerSwagBro9k> SUPER NOT WORTH IT
[5:17:31] <%Sartastic> maybe
[5:17:32] <+Piemen99> NO
[5:17:33] <solidoutlaw> its not far
[5:17:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> YOU SURVIVED MY CAT
[5:17:35] <SomersaultJustice> DO IT COWARD
[5:17:36] <%LordSDB> Someone google it
[5:17:37] <%CaptainPileDriver> MOST DON'T
[5:17:38] <+QueequegTheater> "You survived my cat"
[5:17:39] <+TheRealMasterof7s> just look it up
[5:17:40] <Picia000123> You beat my cat, ok bye
[5:17:46] <+Archmortal> Was the cat worth it? No? So go talk to Mike.
[5:17:47] <%LordSDB> Gamefaq has to know
[5:17:51] <%CaptainPileDriver> YES
[5:17:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's literally not worth it
[5:17:59] <thunderhog> So final part time
[5:18:00] <UnfilteredComic> Then he crossfades out of existence
[5:18:03] <@Solidus_113> dash directly up from here
[5:18:06] <SomersaultJustice> "Now fight Eric Sparrow"
[5:18:13] <%Lion_kun> I hate sueprbosses who give ajck shit for rewards
[5:18:13] <abelincoln_catpuncher> DO IIIIT
[5:18:15] <%CaptainPileDriver> now beat the final boss that's a cake walk
[5:18:17] <jase__x> The worst secret boss in memory
[5:18:20] <Hammatime8> I kinda like how that wasn't worth it at all
[5:18:21] <+RealThiele> "Conglaturations. You have proove the justice of your culture."
[5:18:23] <thunderhog> IIT'S APPENING
[5:18:26] <+MrRabbles> the last trial
[5:18:26] <SleepyMaribo> yall ready to go fuck ajna x infinity?

[5:18:36] <@Solidus_113> WE GOIN TO SPACE
[5:18:37] <+Grayhammatter> the fuck is happening?
[5:18:40] <%Lion_kun> even Midir from DS3 lets you join a covenant

[5:18:52] <hassanico2> It's like antihype trying to be hype
[5:18:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> story unlimited
[5:18:53] <+Qsmash_> take all that damage
[5:19:05] <+ConLin_Arts_> I didn't really like the final boss, but I still had fun with this game, loved the art and characters! <3
[5:19:10] <+theotherkristian> we're in the endgame now

[5:20:01] <abelincoln_catpuncher> I thought it was fitting with the theming if the story, flawed and all

[5:20:06] <@Solidus_113> Kala?
[5:20:10] <StarlitStunner> doogTrash Could you Reggie?
[5:20:17] <+Declan_8000> Hope woolie is ready for perfect blocks after this
[5:20:20] <thunderhog> It's mostly cause it's a lot more platforming that fighting but thats me
[5:20:21] <Andrei11Droasca> Metroid?
[5:20:27] <sagemodeanon> @queequegtheater Art is subjective. just because you thinks it's bad dosent mean everyone does
[5:20:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> you get to see what all the characters are up to and you get too see what ajna is up to.
[5:20:29] <Hamma526> It’s not trial and error lol, depends on your experience with the mechanic
[5:20:41] <+ConLin_Arts_> yeh

[5:20:57] <+RealThiele> house of the dead: overkill vibes

[5:21:12] <%ozzrabbit> just BLOCK!
[5:21:17] <SleepyMaribo> wow its like you got a new power to deal with this and decide to not use it
[5:21:18] <+Qsmash_> that looks so goofy
[5:21:18] <+QueequegTheater> @CaptainPileDriver Unless it's being punished for being a terrible person who causes tons of problems for everyone she meets I don't want to know what Ajna's up to
[5:21:18] <RyuuAoi> Back into where?? NotLikeThis
[5:21:18] <@Solidus_113> parry
[5:21:19] <+Cobaltor_252> vore lets go
[5:21:33] <thewoolieholeofdavidcage> that smash face smack lol
[5:21:34] <solidoutlaw> because it hints that he knows far more of the degenerate arts than he will ever let on
[5:21:35] <%CaptainPileDriver> i'm sorry i liked the game i guess and the ending
[5:21:47] <%LordSDB> Combo in air woolie

[5:22:00] <+RealThiele> color from space boss thing
[5:22:01] <+ConLin_Arts_> German Spy despises this game though
[5:22:05] <solidoutlaw> this game's ending had me nearly in tears
[5:22:06] <%LordSDB> Time to SSS Style the final boss
[5:22:08] <hassanico2> German Spy is right
[5:22:14] <RyuuAoi> FIGHT THE COR
[5:22:16] <Prevot> is that an iphoneca era
[5:22:17] <+QueequegTheater> @CaptainPileDriver Not saying you're bad or anything. I think this game's story is trash and I wasn't enthralled by the gameplay. You're allowed to like what you like, that's totally fine
[5:22:26] <+QueequegTheater> I just don't
[5:22:26] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[5:22:30] <+OmegaWeltall> Giygas?! DansGame
[5:22:33] <hassanico2> But also Spy is a huge Valkyrie Profile fan and this game shits on everything that game does
[5:22:34] <Andrei11Droasca> Now thats some Kirbi shit right there
[5:22:34] <Picia000123> I am glad that someone liked the game, glad that it made someone happy
[5:22:36] <+MrRabbles> 17 health bars huh
[5:22:40] <jfp4life> Latigo level 2+3 destroys kala
[5:22:43] <+Grayhammatter> 17 bars of health? bruh?
[5:22:49] <%CaptainPileDriver> great, then why do you keep telling me how bad the game is every time i say i like it
[5:22:51] <+benial17> X17
[5:22:53] <@Solidus_113> Get that Kampan lvl 7 in there
[5:22:53] <StarlitStunner> stripStab rooSlain Kick her ass
[5:22:55] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Just block
[5:23:00] <+OmegaWeltall> this some Gyigas shit
[5:23:01] <Magoloso> Poertry, it rhymes
[5:23:01] <UnfilteredComic> Its the three eyes with one missing
[5:23:04] <jase__x> cat only had 9
[5:23:04] <%Lion_kun> this does nto seem as abd as the cat
[5:23:10] <+RealThiele> level 7 punchrave soon
[5:23:13] <solidoutlaw> the cat is def harder
[5:23:19] <+ConLin_Arts_> the characters where by far my absolute favorite part of the game!
[5:23:20] <SixthSun2> Oh hi Anubis
[5:23:21] <+ConLin_Arts_> I love em!
[5:23:21] <solidoutlaw> especially since the cat can one shot your party with a super
[5:23:22] <thunderhog> Way better boss than cat
[5:23:27] <%Lion_kun> cat had 9 but had way more health
[5:23:30] <Picia000123> This boss is fine, what comes up is ehh
[5:23:32] <Dutchpotato> Does the glitch for this boss still happen if ajna is in the lower slot of the party?
[5:23:39] <%CaptainPileDriver> shouldn't
[5:23:41] <%Lion_kun> woolie is melting the healthbars with this boss
[5:23:45] <solidoutlaw> the cat is more on battle mechanics, this one is more on the open world mechanics
[5:23:46] <thewoolieholeofdavidcage> what bug?
[5:23:50] <Hamma526> Idk the final encounter is super sick
[5:23:52] <SixthSun2> WutFace
[5:23:52] <+QueequegTheater> @CaptainPileDriver Because my personal flaw is a love of arguing, even to my self detriment
[5:23:54] <UnfilteredComic> KAMPAN

[5:24:21] <thunderhog> YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
[5:24:22] <+ConLin_Arts_> yeah that is also the thing that was a bit of a weird thing to me, that it isn't really a battle mode type of boss
[5:24:24] <Haarute> MELT

[5:26:57] <+ilpeggiore_> DORMAMMU I'VE COME TO.....
[5:26:58] <+Grayhammatter> 13 bars, oh well
[5:26:59] <jase__x> are you serious
[5:27:02] <%CaptainPileDriver> end it with ajna's level 7
[5:27:02] <TigerClaws12> HOW DOES KALA WORK
[5:27:03] <Haarute> still faster than mike's cat.
[5:27:03] <%LordSDB> BITE THE DUSTO!
[5:27:06] <Magoloso> JUST US KAMPAN
[5:27:13] <onyxpunk> new voice sample for symmetra sfm neat
[5:27:17] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @ilpeggiore_ bahahahahaha
[5:27:22] <%KoyFoster> Oh. They added that I think. I don't think they gave you the answer on initial release of the game.
[5:27:23] <StarlitStunner> rooH doogBuff
[5:27:37] <+xx123manxx> I dunno who Kala is but it's prolly doing the right thing
[5:27:47] <%LordSDB> Did Mike Z ever give this game a movelist update?
[5:27:50] <Vivalabonte> Big number go up!
[5:27:53] <%CaptainPileDriver> no
[5:28:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> go to maguma's twitter
[5:28:06] <thunderhog> @lordsdb "movelists are for scrubs" yeah no
[5:28:10] <+RealThiele> sluuuuurp
[5:28:11] <%CaptainPileDriver> he made a movelist
[5:28:20] <Picia000123> Kala just needed a friend all along :)
[5:28:21] <%LordSDB> Image a KoF game with no movelist
[5:28:27] <+QueequegTheater> Wait does it have a movelist or not?
[5:28:39] <%CaptainPileDriver> tmk no
[5:28:39] <thunderhog> Mike didnt make one but theres an unoffical list
[5:28:48] <Dutchpotato> No u have to look online
[5:28:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> but maguma made one that's not official on his twitter
[5:29:01] <Hamma526> I feel like indivisible is for people who like playing fighting games the hard way and who like rpgs. So for that audience I think this game is aces
[5:29:25] <SleepyMaribo> use Ajna's level 7
[5:29:27] <+ConLin_Arts_> Forehead Vorehead
[5:29:27] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[5:29:29] <+QueequegTheater> @Hamma526 I like RPGs for their story and didn't like this game's story at all
[5:29:30] <jase__x> man they even give you free meter
[5:29:39] <Picia000123> @Hamma526 I would not recommend Indivisible as an RPG to anyone but idk
[5:29:43] <Magoloso> DO IT!
[5:29:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> yeah, end it with ajna level 7 if you can, just hit buttons when you do it
[5:29:44] <+RealThiele> shouldve just made a konami code that lets you see it in game if he was worried about movelists
[5:29:58] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @hamma526 I agree, but the lack of a movelist just feels like gatekeeping imo
[5:29:58] <UnfilteredComic> Almost hadthe timing
[5:30:05] <Hamma526> I meant that specific crossover of people
[5:30:08] <%CaptainPileDriver> that tmk
[5:30:27] <solidoutlaw> man this part is sad
[5:30:29] <+ConLin_Arts_> BibleThump
[5:30:33] <+QueequegTheater> Ajna, guess you're just gonna have to fuck it
[5:30:34] <ManlyMcBeefington> left to right imo
[5:30:34] <+Grayhammatter> BibleThump
[5:30:43] <hassanico2> Ajna sucks so like, good riddance LUL
[5:30:49] <Picia000123> aw
[5:30:51] <+xx123manxx> Is she going to die? Good
[5:30:54] <+QueequegTheater> That's more emotion than she showed for Dhar's death
[5:30:55] <thunderhog> ALSO THEY GOT VOICE ACTING
[5:30:56] <+xx123manxx> We can hope
[5:30:57] <solidoutlaw> talk to razmi last for maximum effect BibleThump
[5:30:57] <+Superbro64> rip doodSinwata
[5:31:03] <jase__x> bye ajna wasnt nice knowing you
[5:31:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> SAVE RAZMI FOR LAST
[5:31:07] <DSD24> Thank Dhar you jerk
[5:31:08] <%LordSDB> VoHiYo
[5:31:10] <COMB711> RAZMI LAST FOR ANIME REASONS
[5:31:11] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Nuna LUL
[5:31:13] <thunderhog> VoHiYo
[5:31:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> man this chat hates ajna.
[5:31:23] <+Declan_8000> Leave Razmi for last trust chat
[5:31:26] <%gatorafan> S
[5:31:26] <solidoutlaw> I don't hate ajna
[5:31:30] <+ConLin_Arts_> I liked Ajna
[5:31:34] <Picia000123> I am not an Ajna fan, I admit
[5:31:34] <+ConLin_Arts_> shes dumb sure
[5:31:34] <ManlyMcBeefington> Razmi Last\
[5:31:37] <%CaptainPileDriver> but yeah, save razmi for last
[5:31:37] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[5:31:38] <solidoutlaw> I like her a lot actually
[5:31:41] <TigerClaws12> LUL
[5:31:41] <+enickma11> We stan Ajna
[5:31:45] <+xx123manxx> I don't hate Ajna. I fuuuuuucking haaate Ajna
[5:31:47] <HolisticField> team idiot forever!
[5:31:48] <Magoloso> Ajna is ok.
[5:31:50] <StarlitStunner> rooOWO it is dumb
[5:31:58] <thunderhog> I mean it does for those mushrooms a while back to grow
[5:32:02] <+QueequegTheater> I stan main characters who actually feel sad when their loyal allies die
[5:32:06] <solidoutlaw> put ajna in smash
[5:32:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> you stand there like an idiot
[5:32:10] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Lets go Team Idiot LUL
[5:32:10] <+QueequegTheater> I don't know maybe I'm just weird
[5:32:14] <+Javaa01> I mean, I guess it works on Pokeball rules or something
[5:32:15] <Magoloso> you are
[5:32:18] <wavygravy76> hello gentlemen
[5:32:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> but dhar was a fuck
[5:32:30] <+ConLin_Arts_> Dhar killed billions of people
[5:32:31] <+Superbro64> so is ajna though
[5:32:35] <%CaptainPileDriver> who else died other than dhar the murderer
[5:32:37] <+Maldoree> Dhar did nothing wrong
[5:32:38] <+Superbro64> they're meant for each other
[5:32:40] <abelincoln_catpuncher> Ajna could've been good, but I dont think LZ had a solid enough writing team to flesh out all these characters
[5:32:41] <solidoutlaw> did we play the same game because ajna wasn't exactly jumping in joy at dhar's death
[5:32:43] <+enickma11> @ConLin_Arts_ BILLIONS DOE?
[5:32:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> who did ajna kill
[5:32:49] <jase__x> not even Billions
[5:32:50] <+QueequegTheater> He was literally the only person with a character arc and the INSTANT Dhar realized what he was doing was wrong Dhar stopped
[5:32:54] <+ConLin_Arts_> OSFrog well, somewhat
[5:32:57] <thunderhog> @WoolieVersus For the record, you only get the goodbyes for doing the sidequests, so here's your rewards
[5:33:03] <solidoutlaw> she didn't like him but she wasn't happy
[5:33:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> yes, that's good
[5:33:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> but that doesn't make up for him murdering a shit ton of people
[5:33:14] <%gatorafan> Ajna's character and arc isn't really that badly executed. It's just that the rest of the world doesn't work like it's supposed to so we have this weird dissonance...
[5:33:17] <solidoutlaw> dhar had a good run
[5:33:19] <+Hasmeister96> Wait when did Ginseng and Honey become Ash Ketchum?
[5:33:25] <Magoloso> What he did wrong was massacre a bunch of people
[5:33:27] <+Superbro64> @thunderhog your reward is voice acting and a color palette then
[5:33:32] <%gatorafan> Of people rightfully shitting on Dhar for his misjudgements but letting Ajna go for something similar or worse
[5:33:39] <+Superbro64> no special abilities or anything?
[5:33:40] <%CaptainPileDriver> what did she do
[5:33:41] <Picia000123> The game could do with less jumping between slapstick humor and dire stakes, I think
[5:33:45] <+Manderson1998> @hasmeister96 it's an alt color
[5:33:46] <Magoloso> Like, I love Dhar. But saying he is not wrong is stupid
[5:33:48] <hassanico2> Healers are the most important party members, remember chat
[5:33:49] <%gatorafan> Even the characters who gave Ajna shit before decided to just fuck it and keep going
[5:33:53] <solidoutlaw> dhar may have been on the path to redemption but he did some really bad things
[5:33:54] <StarlitStunner> Remember when Zebei had a character arc and agency like Dhar, then backed down super hard stripThink
[5:33:57] <ManlyMcBeefington> Razmi last
[5:33:59] <+BallerSwagBro9k> So....is Honeu alive?
[5:34:00] <thunderhog> @Superbro64 And I guess for latigo his last bullet
[5:34:04] <+BallerSwagBro9k> honey
[5:34:04] <thunderhog> RAZ FOR LAST
[5:34:07] <%CaptainPileDriver> razmi last
[5:34:09] <Haarute> raz for last
[5:34:09] <HolisticField> RAZMI LAST
[5:34:10] <+Grayhammatter> keep razmi for last
[5:34:13] <COMB711> RAZMI LAST
[5:34:13] <Magoloso> RAZ FOR LAST!
[5:34:15] <abelincoln_catpuncher> SAVE RAMZI FOR last
[5:34:16] <+QueequegTheater> @CaptainPileDriver So did Ajna. Or does stealing Thorani the magical healer from a city suffering from plague not count?
[5:34:16] <MasterDecoder> Razmi last
[5:34:19] <solidoutlaw> TALK TO RAZMI LAST WOOLIE
[5:34:20] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Need to Save Raz for last
[5:34:21] <%KoyFoster> Raz Last Please T_T
[5:34:22] <jase__x> RAZMI IS BEST FRIEND
[5:34:37] <+Superbro64> I miss zebei's ussop nose doodSad
[5:34:41] <COMB711> I've never seen a chat so united
[5:34:42] <stphor> How was Magfest Woolz?
[5:34:45] <Magoloso> I love you Matt Mercer
[5:34:48] <jase__x> man you are not the tough guy
[5:34:50] <abelincoln_catpuncher> Dhar though was a well written character, especially with his sacrifice at the end
[5:34:55] <+QueequegTheater> ^
[5:35:02] <+Maldoree> ^^
[5:35:05] <+QueequegTheater> Dhar is legitimately great
[5:35:07] <%gatorafan> As I said, Dhar got rightfully shat on for most of the game, but Ajna got none of that besides ONE NPC. So it feels weird
[5:35:07] <solidoutlaw> he's well written yeah
[5:35:16] <Magoloso> He was. He also DID kill her dad
[5:35:25] <solidoutlaw> doesn't mean he didn't do bad things though
[5:35:25] <%KoyFoster> dang
[5:35:27] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Yeah... but fuck Dhar
[5:35:31] <+DarksideBluez> Where is YOUR PODCAST? I want more CASTLE SUPER BEATS
[5:35:31] <Magoloso> that does not go away because you had a redemption arc
[5:35:32] <%gatorafan> Ajna being dumb isn't even bad, it's just that the rest of the cast doesn't reac properly.
[5:35:34] <StarlitStunner> Dhar also has the BOOTY doogLewd
[5:35:43] <solidoutlaw> if anything, the fact that ajna didn't forgive him for that but still felt sorry for his death says a lot
[5:35:46] <+Superbro64> didnt ian flyn contribute some of his writing prowess to this game? Or did his stuff not get in?
[5:35:50] <+Superbro64> Am I crazy?

[5:54:15] <+ConLin_Arts_> Imp Midna is Thicc though
[5:54:15] <+DiabloDeAzul> 108 temptations of buddhism
[5:54:16] <+zanzibar_junker> 108 stars of dedtiny
[5:54:17] <SoySocks> esoteric facts about the number 108?
[5:54:18] <+ilpeggiore_> the chackras
[5:54:20] <lotharrio> It's a holy number that represents perfection
[5:54:26] <SomersaultJustice> Ajna, become a paladin!
[5:54:29] <Malikwest11> number of beards monk wear I think
[5:54:37] <+Hasmeister96> I think 108 is like 108 earthly corruptions or something?
[5:54:38] <abelincoln_catpuncher> too each their own. her being 10 ft tall is probably what does it for me
[5:54:52] <%KoyFoster> xD
[5:54:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> do it again
[5:54:56] <+ilpeggiore_> oh so you just have to survive

[5:55:32] <+jiggy_snipe> I think her feet are still busted
[5:55:33] <zenith0111> Why 108?
[5:55:41] <+ConLin_Arts_> holy number
[5:55:52] <solidoutlaw> Daigo canonically can parry gods
[5:55:53] <+ShogunNoonto> so the end pf the game is parry god
[5:55:55] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus You can skip that scene if you need to
[5:56:00] <zenith0111> Why is 108 holy?
[5:56:06] <solidoutlaw> slide under the orbs, woolie
[5:56:07] <hassanico2> Wait is 108 attacks?
[5:56:07] <stphor> It just is
[5:56:14] <+theotherkristian> will this take a while
[5:56:15] <Andrei11Droasca> This villain seems really meh
[5:56:16] <SomersaultJustice> we fighting marie now
[5:56:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> yes, just dodge or parry
[5:56:19] <jfp4life> just dodge bro
[5:56:24] <+ilpeggiore_> that's not a parry woolz
[5:56:26] <Haarute> hold circle to skip dialogue
[5:56:27] <%Lion_kun> so is this just a gauntlet?
[5:56:30] <+benial17> I'm guessing this is only going to last like a minute
[5:56:32] <+DiabloDeAzul> we 2hu now
[5:56:33] <Idon__> this is the dumbest final boss....
[5:56:34] <TigerClaws12> just parry 4Head
[5:56:38] <SleepyMaribo> well Mike Z is known for making bad final bosses, just look at Skullgirls final boss
[5:56:40] <stphor> Parry only run
[5:56:41] <abelincoln_catpuncher> Royalguard time Woolie
[5:56:41] <hassanico2> Nah 2hu makes pretty aptterns
[5:56:42] <%ozzrabbit> wow, Sans really changed, huh?
[5:56:45] <+ilpeggiore_> "just backdash"
[5:56:48] <+BallerSwagBro9k> @benial17 yeah its actually pretty short
[5:57:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> this final boss is fine
[5:57:09] <stphor> Thou shalt parry the boss
[5:57:12] <hassanico2> SHe's shooting blanka balls, watch out Woolie!
[5:57:17] <Haarute> i like this idea for a final boss.
[5:57:26] <stphor> This final boss is OK
[5:57:37] <solidoutlaw> I like this boss because it's one last challenge of the movement mechanics, even if it's only your base movements
[5:57:38] <Afterman_> woolies stylew
[5:57:39] <%CaptainPileDriver> the final boss is fine/ok
[5:57:40] <Afterman_> style*
[5:57:43] <+jiggy_snipe> are all of her attacks fighting game specials?
[5:57:43] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1210124488463077376
[5:57:44] <solidoutlaw> that and the parry
[5:57:48] <sir_foxwood> Get good
[5:57:48] <COMB711> Royal Guard
[5:57:52] <COMB711> Boss form
[5:57:52] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Welcome to DIE
[5:57:53] <HolisticField> i dislike it bc it's pure trial and error
[5:57:54] <+kurosaru96> Remember what your father taught you. PARRY!
[5:57:56] <solidoutlaw> it's not my favorite fight but it's a good one
[5:57:56] <thunderhog> Parry class 108
[5:58:00] <zenith0111> Oh so this is why Plague didn't like this game as much.
[5:58:14] <Idon__> low profile EVERYTHING
[5:58:39] <Magoloso> PARRY YOU SCRUB
[5:58:40] <Prevot> monkaS
[5:58:41] <Magoloso> NO JONS
[5:58:42] <SleepyMaribo> woolie bad at 3rd strike confirmed
[5:58:44] <thunderhog> Gotta parry that Shinku Hado
[5:58:46] <zenith0111> Yeah when I heard Turn Based Fighting game this is far from what I imagine.
[5:58:51] <Rangenade> wheres the option to view hurtboxes man
[5:58:53] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @solidoutlaw
[5:58:54] <+xx123manxx> i mustard
[5:59:02] <abelincoln_catpuncher> you can parry EVERYTHING she does, just get the timing down (which does take a few tries)
[5:59:07] <COMB711> I like this fight because it's thematic
[5:59:16] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Man Moobot is aggressive today
[5:59:18] <solidoutlaw> Just pretend the big ball is a dog trying to love you, parry the love Woolie
[5:59:21] <zenith0111> @comb711 But why?
[5:59:31] <%CaptainPileDriver> he got that laser the first time
[5:59:33] <hassanico2> In theory the fight is good, but in practice it's making you use a mechanic you've barely used because of the game's bad balance
[5:59:42] <Haarute> evo moment 108
[5:59:43] <abelincoln_catpuncher> yeah Ajna learns she cant win everything by just punching it in the face
[5:59:48] <solidoutlaw> what mechanic did you barely use @hassanico2
[5:59:52] <Hamma526> Yeah but it’s a cool right who cares
[5:59:56] <COMB711> @zenith0111 your dad always talked about having a good defense, it's the first and last thing you do
[5:59:57] <hassanico2> Parrying in fights
[5:59:59] <Idon__> Kala tone down the ham, lol
[6:00:00] <@Solidus_113> Better final boss than Marie in SG?
[6:00:05] <solidoutlaw> I disagree, I parried the entire game
[6:00:08] <abelincoln_catpuncher> dude partying is instrumental this game lol
[6:00:16] <TigerClaws12> LUL
[6:00:17] <hassanico2> Enemies died too quick for parrying to be any use
[6:00:19] <solidoutlaw> there are even enemies with attacks that you can ONLY parry
[6:00:19] <Mvrdok_> LUL
[6:00:19] <%KoyFoster> That's a huge pog.
[6:00:21] <abelincoln_catpuncher> parrying* my phone just hates me
[6:00:22] <zenith0111> @comb711 calebSleeper
[6:00:27] <Afterman_> oh hey its anjali as the voice actress for kala
[6:00:31] <+RowenCleric> yea I am pretty ok with that
[6:00:32] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Hell Yes Woolz
[6:00:33] <+Superbro64> can ajna be any MORE neutral tone in her responses?
[6:00:37] <DSD24> You've killed humans too Akna
[6:00:38] <%LordSDB> DID SHE JUST CALL US BASE?
[6:00:39] <DSD24> Ajna
[6:00:40] <+benial17> Big and titty are 2 seperate descriptions
[6:00:41] <solidoutlaw> parrying is one of the first things the game teaches you
[6:00:46] <%CaptainPileDriver> PARRY
[6:00:52] <Magoloso> PARRY DICKHEAD!
[6:00:52] <zenith0111> ACTIVATE
[6:00:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> you gotta PARRY
[6:00:55] <@Solidus_113> DEFEND
[6:00:57] <Hamma526> The point is that she is doing a neutral response, she’s at peace
[6:01:02] <Prevot> PogChamp
[6:01:04] <@Solidus_113> PARRY TO VICTORY
[6:01:08] <Andrei11Droasca> Has Ajna not seen Twitter Kappa
[6:01:11] <Picia000123> This boss was made for Woolie
[6:01:12] <%KoyFoster> xD
[6:01:14] <SleepyMaribo> now redo the entire fight!
[6:01:14] <+Hasmeister96> You guys remember Raavannavaar?
[6:01:16] <+benial17> DNA hair?

[6:01:41] <Mvrdok_> This is some Monsoon shit
[6:01:50] <faeron93> its your favorite mechanic Woolie
[6:01:58] <zenith0111> Dude I just thinking this game better not pull a boss fight like this... and they did. Fuck
[6:02:00] <Andrei11Droasca> Is this boss made for Daigo?
[6:02:21] <HolisticField> What's wrong with you?
[6:02:29] <+Hasmeister96> So what was Raavannavaar's plan again?
[6:02:40] <+benial17> Bayo forward-smash
[6:02:47] <Haarute> d e s t r o y e d
[6:02:49] <solidoutlaw> he wanted Kala to reset the world
[6:02:50] <+MostRefinedCalla> Did I just walk in on the final boss?!!!
[6:02:53] <DSD24> Yes
[6:02:54] <COMB711> yes
[6:02:56] <+aishman> @WoolieVersus You have to block right before she charges up
[6:02:58] <+Javaa01> 3 is when the freezeframe ends
[6:02:58] <Magoloso> yuuuuup
[6:02:59] <stphor> Gallick Gun
[6:03:02] <+aishman> And just keep it held down
[6:03:04] <+MostRefinedCalla> Oof
[6:03:05] <%KoyFoster> Dude here animation are so cool, but you don't get to see them cause you are focused on yourself.
[6:03:06] <Idon__> Mike Z why would you do this
[6:03:08] <SoySocks> it's on the off beat
[6:03:09] <%KoyFoster> her*
[6:03:12] <Hamma526> Buffer parry
[6:03:23] <zenith0111> So much for strategy. Do this parry to win the game you fucks LUL
[6:03:24] <+FrostedZaibatsu> That's YOUR level 3
[6:03:31] <+Superbro64> trial and error, the favorite of any rpg
[6:03:35] <SleepyMaribo> it be easier to just parry everything
[6:03:42] <hassanico2> My power went out, what happened after the mid fight dialogue?
[6:03:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> man you guys are mad about this game you haven't played
[6:03:49] <thunderhog> I mean i hate to too my own horn but I did this my first go. Kinda used to parrying by this point after doing that cat boss
[6:04:01] <zenith0111> @superbro64 Except your trials or strats not your execution LUL

[6:04:51] <%derrickslays> yo reggie low key hilarious
[6:04:52] <%Lion_kun> what a lame final boss
[6:04:57] <+ConLin_Arts_> Kalas proporions here LUL
[6:04:58] <Magoloso> USE YOUR 420 AJNA
[6:04:59] <Hamma526> KINO
[6:04:59] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's fine
[6:05:03] <Hamma526> very raw boss
[6:05:04] <DSD24> Let's fusion dance
[6:05:06] <zenith0111> @captainpiledriver And with that now I never will :)
[6:05:16] <%CaptainPileDriver> good for you
[6:05:29] <DSD24> Really?
[6:05:35] <Picia000123> awww
[6:05:36] <Andrei11Droasca> I've seen way worst ,that was totally fine
[6:05:37] <+ilpeggiore_> she looks like lust from FMA
[6:05:42] <onyxpunk> she can get it
[6:05:44] <Prevot> she totally does
[6:05:45] <DSD24> She looking cute there
[6:05:46] <+xx123manxx> old ballsack ears
[6:05:55] <Hamma526> Very raw design
[6:05:58] <+BallerSwagBro9k> IMO this game is fine. A solid 7
[6:06:03] <nobknee> Like Dhar.
[6:06:03] <@Solidus_113> Taking a note from Naruto, even the final boss has a sad backstory so you feel bad for them
[6:06:05] <hassanico2> Flawed beings like Dhar :)
[6:06:07] <DSD24> Like Dhar
[6:06:08] <Magoloso> solid 7 is right
[6:06:09] <UnfilteredComic> Naga Rider was perfect though
[6:06:10] <Prevot> and Ajna is SUPER flawed LUL
[6:06:11] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @xx123manxx it's a Hindu theme to show enlightenment
[6:06:21] <nobknee> Dhar's a good boy.
[6:06:22] <+MrRabbles> remember the swing
[6:06:23] <+froduck42> all i can hear is symmetra
[6:06:24] <+Superbro64> naruto final final boss had a sad backstory?
[6:06:27] <jubejube56> If this were naruto we’d have 3 final bosses by now
[6:06:29] <+MrRabbles> never forget the swing
[6:06:29] <%KoyFoster> A good game with no problems.
[6:06:30] <Magoloso> @hassanico2 That's the pont
[6:06:32] <SleepyMaribo> A reminder, Ajna refused to forgive Dhar even after he gave his life to save her, Yet Ajna straight forgives Kala like its no big deal.
[6:06:33] <DSD24> Wait Kala is Symmetra?
[6:06:35] <+Superbro64> or the final before the final final boss?
[6:06:37] <+froduck42> yes
[6:06:41] <Picia000123> I can understand if this game is swimming in 7s for someone
[6:06:42] <COMB711> I just wish they spread out the side quests rather than dumping them all at once right before the finish line
[6:06:42] <+Hasmeister96> So Kala is basically a God that's capable of guilt?
[6:06:45] <jorniev> look at them down there blowing up the world with nukes

[6:08:05] <solidoutlaw> I like this ending
[6:08:05] <Magoloso> nah
[6:08:05] <+Kiiper> I liked the ending
[6:08:07] <Picia000123> it's ver meh
[6:08:12] <jase__x> This ending just kinda lame
[6:08:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> i mean, if you can't kill the ultimate power what else are you supposed to do
[6:08:15] <HolisticField> i like the ending, just not the boss fight
[6:08:15] <solidoutlaw> I liked the entire game
[6:08:19] <+Kiiper> Looking at it later on from outside, the VA is really flart
[6:08:20] <+aishman> This is such mood whiplash

[6:08:57] <abelincoln_catpuncher> thank you woolie
[6:08:58] <karl_rex> Bring back Dad killer
[6:08:59] <DSD24> Celeste was amazing
[6:09:00] <Picia000123> yeah, the game says story dont matter, and then makes effort for you to try to care
[6:09:00] <SleepyMaribo> but fuck Dhar though Right?
[6:09:02] <TheWashoutXY> REINCARNATE BEST BOY DHAR
[6:09:05] <zenith0111> @captainpiledriver Pray. Which oddly seems to be the message.
[6:09:06] <Kiraklene> The world can never be perfect without Dhar
[6:09:14] <+aishman> Like I feel this game's tone is so all over the place.
[6:09:24] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Wait till after credits
[6:09:25] <Haarute> i mean you can't KILL GOD.
[6:09:33] <+Kiiper> That sure is the point
[6:09:34] <%Lion_kun> and everyone lived
[6:09:36] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Andrei11Droasca
[6:09:37] <+DrPoxx> Razmi will trap god
[6:09:37] <%Lion_kun> except dar
[6:09:38] <HolisticField> EMPTY
[6:09:38] <Magoloso> not with that attitude
[6:09:40] <%Lion_kun> because fuck Dar
[6:09:41] <DSD24> Hero lineup
[6:09:43] <thunderhog> Look at that PERFECTLY EMPTY SPOT there
[6:09:44] <jorniev> you can only beat up GOD so much
[6:09:45] <Prevot> @Haarute not with that attitude
[6:09:45] <%LordSDB> But my japanese rpgs say I can kill god
[6:09:46] <UnfilteredComic> That poor empty space
[6:09:46] <+Kiiper> Look at the big gap
[6:09:47] <+Superbro64> if asura's wrath use the same mythos as indivisble (I forget if it does), then this final story beat is almost an exact opposite from asura
[6:09:48] <+aishman> WEIRD SPACE HUH
[6:09:49] <jase__x> you can kill god but you have to be Asura or Kratos
[6:09:49] <%CaptainPileDriver> and look at the empty space for the 2 other characters
[6:09:52] <solidoutlaw> look at that gap for someone who didn't make it in
[6:09:53] <+BallerSwagBro9k> @haarute ASURAS and Kratod are typing.
[6:09:53] <+ConLin_Arts_> still an impressive game, it is an Indie game after all!
[6:09:54] <+Polter_ge1st> Where are they even at to be looking at all of this?
[6:09:54] <+Kiiper> For the character that never came out
[6:09:55] <+MrRabbles> the Dhar space
[6:09:56] <+aishman> ALMOST AS IF TWO MORE PEOPLE WERE THERE
[6:09:56] <DSD24> That Giant Dhar gap
[6:09:57] <Magoloso> THAT'S FOR SHOVEL KNIGHT
[6:09:57] <+FrostedZaibatsu> No a lost cause. They just delayed it
[6:09:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> 2 characters could fit there
[6:10:00] <%KoyFoster> Dhar's space.
[6:10:04] <%CaptainPileDriver> i know
[6:10:04] <UnfilteredComic> Sangmu was her name i think
[6:10:08] <solidoutlaw> a spot for the baz should he had came
[6:10:08] <+Sulfur_Boride> So chat, I watched Simmons, Max's friend, play through this to the ending, and I SHIT YOU NOT, NO MUSIC was playing when this ending screen with all your pals played. My fucking god...
[6:10:11] <+Kiiper> Sangmu yeah
[6:10:11] <%KoyFoster> You got the bad ending, Woolie.
[6:10:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> the switch version is delayed until june 30th
[6:10:13] <+BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[6:10:15] <%Lion_kun> so did Ajna die?
[6:10:17] <+MrRabbles> he's right
[6:10:19] <+Superbro64> asura murders the heck out of god
[6:10:21] <%CaptainPileDriver> yes and no
[6:10:21] <+MrRabbles> when you're right you're right
[6:10:23] <MasterDecoder> @Lion_kun No
[6:10:28] <SomersaultJustice> END
[6:10:30] <HolisticField> @WoolieVersus final thoughts?
[6:10:30] <+RowenCleric> he is not wrong
[6:10:32] <SoySocks> yay videogames!
[6:10:32] <+aishman> Are you ready for super long unskippable cut scene?!
[6:10:32] <TheWashoutXY> Kinda shit, right chat?
[6:10:34] <+aishman> I SURE AM
[6:10:34] <zenith0111> I liked the game

[6:10:50] <london_flexing> 6/10
[6:10:52] <stphor> Post credit scene
[6:10:52] <@Solidus_113> They sped up the credits, but it still repeats like 3 times
[6:10:53] <+aishman> I don't think you can even skip it
[6:10:55] <zenith0111> Final Boss was not the best but I understand what they were going for
[6:10:55] <SomersaultJustice> with no other context, that ending was fine
[6:10:56] <solidoutlaw> Razmi BibleThump
[6:10:58] <Haarute> i enjoyed the entire final boss and interactions too.
[6:10:59] <+BallerSwagBro9k> End song is rad
[6:10:59] <Picia000123> 5/10
[6:11:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> YEAH RAZMI
[6:11:01] <jase__x> 5/10
[6:11:02] <stphor> Introducing Shovel Knight
[6:11:03] <+ilpeggiore_> guys how long is this game in hours?
[6:11:03] <+aishman> Oh they sped up the credits? Good
[6:11:03] <karl_rex> Dad killer Dhar should have shown up and killed God
[6:11:04] <solidoutlaw> Razmi has Roti even
[6:11:10] <DSD24> Ah thats nice
[6:11:12] <Magoloso> 7/10. it could be better
[6:11:13] <Andrei11Droasca> one billion Ajnas dead ,world is a fuck
[6:11:17] <TheWashoutXY> <3 KINUKO's art <3
[6:11:17] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Awww
[6:11:17] <+aishman> Yeah this is way faster than when I finished it
[6:11:20] <ArtooKilledYou> A decent 5/10
[6:11:20] <jfp4life> Sangmu and Antoine were cut to be reworked shortly before launch
[6:11:24] <mrgrimsmiles> 7/10
[6:11:25] <+Kiiper> It's a super solid 7/10 yeah
[6:11:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> 8/10 personally, 6.5/10 casually
[6:11:26] <%LordSDB> 7.5/10 I can see them coming back and doing much better
[6:11:27] <Magoloso> but the characters are great
[6:11:31] <+MrRabbles> smug baby now happy child
[6:11:32] <+ConLin_Arts_> SMUG
[6:11:33] <+BallerSwagBro9k> 7/10
[6:11:37] <COMB711> Johnathan "persona" Kim
[6:11:39] <+Sulfur_Boride> Imagine seeing this for the first time, but NO MUSIC was playing when your friends appeared on screen or after. I literally witnessed this first-hand.
[6:11:40] <%KoyFoster> I don't like that Senketsu had to die.
[6:11:47] <jase__x> like she goes back to drinking instead of getting THAT ASS
[6:11:47] <+Piemen99> 6.5/10
[6:11:48] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[6:11:50] <+ConLin_Arts_> yeah the Characters is the biggest <3 for me
[6:12:00] <zenith0111> Ajna is Jesus wtf LUL nice comparison
[6:12:07] <Magoloso> RIDER!
[6:12:08] <DracOmega64> !motivated
[6:12:08] <@Moobot> 562 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[6:12:09] <+zanzibar_junker> Satan and Devilman is sorta that
[6:12:12] <+kurosaru96> He had a mask!
[6:12:12] <thunderhog> And ginseng had a mask too
[6:12:12] <abelincoln_catpuncher> 7. 5 for me, the poor writing and Mt. Sumeru platforming really grinded my gears
[6:12:14] <+kurosaru96> an owlmask
[6:12:17] <+FrostedZaibatsu> 7. 6.5??? TF yall smoking
[6:12:22] <zenith0111> LUL
[6:12:24] <solidoutlaw> 9/10 for me
[6:12:29] <lotharrio> 7/10 but only because of the pieces that don't mesh together are still pretty good.
[6:12:33] <thunderhog> Ren with the runback on his whole clan
[6:12:35] <Andrei11Droasca> I bet we could just shoot god
[6:12:38] <hassanico2> Y'all are way too kind
[6:12:39] <solidoutlaw> wish there were more quick travel points
[6:12:42] <DSD24> Yo who's that Ninja girl
[6:12:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> @FrostedZaibatsu this game does have legit problems, but i still love it personally
[6:12:47] <+stagemage> 4/10
[6:12:47] <+ConLin_Arts_> probably a 7.5/10 for me
[6:12:47] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Ren's mom can get it
[6:12:48] <solidoutlaw> a lot of backtracking for side quests
[6:12:48] <+DrJamesWoods> When's the next WoolieVS God?
[6:12:49] <Magoloso> let's kill God you guys
[6:12:52] <abelincoln_catpuncher> it's almost we like this game so we rate it well lol
[6:12:53] <+aishman> As someone who played this game constantly, FUCK I hated going back and forth to do the side quests
[6:12:54] <Soulbishop> Damn i missed the stream
[6:12:57] <stphor> "You pirating games over there?" -Angry God
[6:12:59] <+aishman> Or rather to the finish
[6:13:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> @aishman yeah, i agree
[6:13:12] <%KoyFoster> I stayed home and played this game instead of going to work when it released. FeelsGoodMan.
[6:13:16] <+ConLin_Arts_> but please lads! Don't rain on Woolies parade!
[6:13:17] <+aishman> All they had to do, was make more teleportation spots and it'd be fine
[6:13:21] <Prevot> clap for Zone
[6:13:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> yes
[6:13:23] <+aishman> Instead it's such a fucking pain in the ass
[6:13:25] <Magoloso> "who the hell is smoking weed? time to nuke it" -God
[6:13:26] <@Solidus_113> and repeat the song
[6:13:30] <+aishman> And makes the fighting start becoming dull
[6:13:32] <CrazyMedicine> 7/10
[6:13:36] <jorniev> Dhar
[6:13:37] <zenith0111> And the angry God decided to not do anything... the end 4Head
[6:13:37] <solidoutlaw> I wonder if lab zero will make vulcan heel next
[6:13:38] <hassanico2> Additional Writing : Ian Flynn, nice
[6:13:43] <solidoutlaw> Dog Dad
[6:13:44] <lotharrio> I think they tried to do too much at the same time, over-reached on things that should have been a slam dunk and made some really obvious fuckups that they just shrugged off.
[6:13:47] <+ConLin_Arts_> DAD DOG
[6:13:48] <thunderhog> All this ending art is great
[6:13:51] <+FrostedZaibatsu> @CaptainPileDriver the first of its genre. With probable which i understand because i played it. Its above average
[6:14:07] <Picia000123> The fact that NO ONE was on her case was really weird to me
[6:14:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's 8/10 for me, 6.5 for the casual person
[6:14:12] <thewoolieholeofdavidcage> a strong 7/10. just some writing been okay to bad at points and how quest markers missing
[6:14:12] <Andrei11Droasca> Fuck god ,ill do all the mushrooms i want LUL
[6:14:14] <abelincoln_catpuncher> yeah Thorani should've been way harder on her
[6:14:21] <+Hasmeister96> Yo when's Thorani's epilogue?
[6:14:28] <DSD24> Dhar was trying his best to stop Ajna from making the same mistake he did
[6:14:28] <Magoloso> Dhar was great
[6:14:31] <+kurosaru96> that kid staring up
[6:14:33] <zenith0111> @captainpiledriver Thanks for rating for everyone 4Head
[6:14:42] <projecthazoid> BOAT STEAL
[6:14:47] <+ConLin_Arts_> the only Kickstarter game I backed that I was disappointed in was Mighty No. 9
[6:14:51] <+Manderson1998> that kid staring up at Phoebe is a mood
[6:14:55] <+ConLin_Arts_> every other game has been solid
[6:14:55] <+cvp5127> lol
[6:14:56] <hassanico2> LUL
[6:14:58] <+aishman> The traversal, the tonal shifts and the lack of a lot of RPG mechanics hurt it for me
[6:14:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> i'm sorry i gave my opionion, sure is like you could make you own shithead
[6:14:59] <DSD24> But Dhar got vaporized though
[6:14:59] <thunderhog> REGGIE CONTEXT
[6:14:59] <hassanico2> Reggie noooo
[6:15:01] <+DrJamesWoods> MonkaS
[6:15:06] <thunderhog> SHE HAS A MOUTH
[6:15:06] <@Solidus_113> angel dust~
[6:15:07] <+ConLin_Arts_> LIPS
[6:15:07] <+A123yourdead> This game long!

[6:15:15] <zenith0111> @captainpiledriver 6/10 4Head
[6:15:16] <CrazyMedicine> LIPS PogChamp
[6:15:17] <+Sulfur_Boride> Oh? I saw Chris Niosi's name on there. Whoo boy...
[6:15:17] <%KoyFoster> Lippless
[6:15:18] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Miss Steal Your Boat LUL
[6:15:20] <jase__x> ;LIPS
[6:15:20] <+aishman> But yeah I think it's a good 6-7/10
[6:15:23] <+Archmortal> This is an 8/10 for me. A little more focus and a functional move list would've brought it at least to a 9.
[6:15:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> oh man, you did it, good for you
[6:15:28] <solidoutlaw> lip implants
[6:15:33] <+aishman> So I'm honestly with @CaptainPileDriver
[6:15:36] <HolisticField> 6/10
[6:15:42] <+FrostedZaibatsu> HAHA that man said DSL
[6:15:47] <hassanico2> @Sulfur_Boride dude has hella connections still but LUL
[6:15:50] <thewoolieholeofdavidcage> dat booty
[6:15:55] <AGood_Noodle> It's a solid 7 for me
[6:16:04] <CrazyMedicine> LUL
[6:16:05] <lotharrio> They were also inconsistent with what her powers actually were, along with the limits of them.
[6:16:06] <+kurosaru96> They cut off his mustache
[6:16:08] <FeelinNifty> Oh fuck! His mustache! Oh god!!!
[6:16:08] <+cvp5127> f
[6:16:09] <+kurosaru96> HAH
[6:16:09] <COMB711> mustache decimated
[6:16:09] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Do they ever say why she has no arms?
[6:16:10] <hassanico2> RIP mustache
[6:16:17] <+ConLin_Arts_> you at least feel that it was made with passion and love, it might have been 505 that needed the release date that might have botched some stuff up
[6:16:20] <abelincoln_catpuncher> she totally cut off his moustache xD
[6:16:23] <+MrRabbles> cmon its just bread guys
[6:16:25] <%gatorafan> I'll give this game a solid waitforallthepatchesandupdates/10
[6:16:25] <zenith0111> @captainpiledriver LUL
[6:16:26] <Hamma526> TUNGAR GETS PUSSY
[6:16:34] <%CaptainPileDriver> yes?
[6:16:35] <hassanico2> @MrRabbles TEN YEARS IN JAIL
[6:16:40] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Tungar Fucks? LUL
[6:16:41] <solidoutlaw> Tungar gonna father them kids
[6:16:42] <%CaptainPileDriver> do you need something @zenith0111
[6:16:42] <TigerClaws12> they fixed it tho Kappa
[6:16:54] <+cvp5127> cant wait for indivisible: encore
[6:16:54] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Tungar be fuckin
[6:16:56] <Hamma526> He got in with the kids
[6:16:58] <Hamma526> It’s over
[6:16:58] <zenith0111> @captainpiledriver Not with that attitude goodbye
[6:16:58] <lotharrio> I can see a few changes that would make this a 9/10. But it's not something that can get patched in.
[6:17:00] <%ozzrabbit> shout the bugs into oblivion
[6:17:04] <hassanico2> World Navigation was the worst bit by far
[6:17:13] <solidoutlaw> Tungar gonna FUCK then take those kids to McDonalds
[6:17:14] <lotharrio> Getting a single "fleshing out" of most of the characters is awful.
[6:17:16] <%CaptainPileDriver> @zenith0111 great, then stop talking to me then, like, it's real easy
[6:17:28] <hassanico2> Like, quick travel would be a great addition
[6:17:31] <@Solidus_113> liam!
[6:17:37] <hassanico2> Even as a late unlockable
[6:17:41] <@Solidus_113> Matt!
[6:17:44] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Sidequest were ehh. The map traversal sucked ass
[6:17:45] <COMB711> Mane6 PogChamp
[6:17:47] <+benial17> Tyson Hesse in the list
[6:17:51] <HolisticField> that was labzero's plan, but then they didnt
[6:17:53] <lotharrio> Adding two fast travel points in each map would help a lot.
[6:17:57] <Picia000123> Just cut some of the content from the game and polish the rest
[6:18:03] <thunderhog> ALL of Third Strike was in the credits
[6:18:08] <Picia000123> You don't need a metroidvania map
[6:18:14] <+Hasmeister96> OK but what if Ajna gets reincarnated to have a horrible life and becomes evil?
[6:18:15] <lotharrio> The traversal wasn't as fun as they thought it was.
[6:18:15] <abelincoln_catpuncher> yeah the side quests got reaaaaal irritating
[6:18:17] <+xx123manxx> damn shes hot
[6:18:20] <CrazyMedicine> PogChamp
[6:18:21] <solidoutlaw> anti-woolie ajna because she has long hair
[6:18:22] <thunderhog> Kalajna
[6:18:23] <Picia000123> There she is
[6:18:23] <%gatorafan> eh
[6:18:25] <Prevot> CUTE
[6:18:25] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[6:18:28] <+Aeoneth> Shantai?
[6:18:28] <DSD24> Purple hair is rad
[6:18:28] <Magoloso> DATS HOT
[6:18:29] <%Lion_kun> so Ajna did die
[6:18:29] <+cvp5127> oh noshes hot
[6:18:30] <%gatorafan> purple hair kinda ruins it
[6:18:33] <%CaptainPileDriver> and that's it
[6:18:33] <jase__x> SHE MADE NO SACRIFICE
[6:18:33] <solidoutlaw> shantaejna
[6:18:34] <$AliasofApocalypse> DAs Hot tho
[6:18:35] <+ConLin_Arts_> a good indiegame!
[6:18:35] <Picia000123> So, how was it Woolie?
[6:18:35] <Magoloso> SEQUEL HAIR
[6:18:36] <DSD24> So she's smarter now
[6:18:38] <hassanico2> RIP Ajna you sucked and now a better you is around
[6:18:44] <%Lion_kun> she fused and became a new person
[6:18:47] <%LordSDB> Not dead reincarnated
[6:18:48] <+MrRabbles> Dhar and Ajna dead
[6:18:48] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1210124488463077376
[6:18:48] <projecthazoid> And Then Risky Bootsoots raided the island of Sequin Land
[6:18:55] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Naw, she still dumb
[6:18:56] <thunderhog> THATS THE GAME
[6:18:57] <Haarute> razmi had roti in the credits.
[6:18:57] <solidoutlaw> it makes me sad because she reincarnates at 16
[6:18:58] <DSD24> Dhar gets nothing
[6:18:59] <%Lion_kun> let's hope this Ajna isn't as much of a screwup as the old Ajna
[6:19:00] <solidoutlaw> she was still a kid
[6:19:00] <lotharrio> Traversal wasn't as fun as they thought it was. Combat became increasingly unimportant/meaningless.
[6:19:00] <+ConLin_Arts_> the first one
[6:19:00] <%gatorafan> The Cooler Ajna
[6:19:02] <Picia000123> yay we done
[6:19:09] <+stagemage> But Shar is still dead on a blown up mountain
[6:19:12] <HolisticField> i dont think she reincarnates at 16
[6:19:12] <%KoyFoster> That's it. Can't wait for the DLC expansion.
[6:19:14] <+ConLin_Arts_> the title screen from the beginning of the game
[6:19:15] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Dhar is just a shadow on a wall now
[6:19:23] <Picia000123> I was so bummed when Dhar died
[6:19:28] <jase__x> Fuck Dhar bro doesnt even get reincarnated
[6:19:32] <%CaptainPileDriver> @KoyFoster it's gonna be awhile sadly
[6:19:32] <TigerClaws12> NotLikeThis
[6:19:33] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Yeah Dhar was the best character fo sure
[6:19:39] <abelincoln_catpuncher> anti-Aerith xD
[6:19:41] <solidoutlaw> I thought Woolie meant Tekken Aris lol
[6:19:42] <lotharrio> And they do Dhar dirty. There's a lot of characters who should only have good memories of him, but they are just, "Well, don't worry about killing him, Ajna."
[6:19:45] <+ConLin_Arts_> that isn't how you spell Razmi
[6:19:47] <DSD24> Dhar was my favorite
[6:19:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> dhar is the best written thing in this game. period
[6:19:55] <+ConLin_Arts_> Razmi is best character!
[6:19:59] <+zanzibar_junker> i was today all the way woolie
[6:20:06] <+zanzibar_junker> tifa
[6:20:07] <Picia000123> @CaptainPileDriver true that
[6:20:20] <hassanico2> But I do want Dhar! He does so much damage!
[6:20:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> razmi is my favorite person to chat with but dhar is legit the best
[6:20:26] <foreverN2dust> It's Snape?
[6:20:34] <+silvery_cricket> Who is Aeris?
[6:20:34] <+MrRabbles> ooops all dead
[6:20:36] <DSD24> Dhar was awesome he was so good
[6:20:37] <spacecatstreams> oh SHIT its woolie
[6:20:38] <%gatorafan> Razmi was annoying most of the time. daedra1DerpyTibs
[6:20:39] <%edgateway> edgateway subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[6:20:41] <%CaptainPileDriver> god when he died i was so fucking sad, i got him to like, plus 25 hearts
[6:20:44] <DSD24> @silvery_cricket Girl from Final Fantasy 7
[6:20:55] <thewoolieholeofdavidcage> let trigger make the anime version
[6:21:03] <SomersaultJustice> Aeristh
[6:21:13] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @captainpiledriver I know me too, I rushed past where Woolie was and was waiting so hard for his reaction
[6:21:19] <+silvery_cricket> @DSD24 Who is that thought?
[6:21:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> lol, yeah
[6:21:25] <jase__x> iit happens before the mid way point
[6:21:27] <+BallerSwagBro9k> @thewoolieholeofdavidcage Thatd be so sick
[6:21:27] <+silvery_cricket> though
[6:21:28] <+zanzibar_junker> let Trigger make a goddamn Transformers anime
[6:21:29] <+Kiiper> He look at that character that doesn't exist
[6:21:34] <+ClaudeMcGarren> @AliasofApocalypse giant braind, pink coat, staff
[6:21:36] <toshuapoint0> Hey chat, been looking around the web but couldn't find anything about this, but has Pat read all of Parte 5 of GioGio? I know that on his podcast with Woolie, he watched the recent anime but has he read the manga version as well?
[6:21:38] <+ClaudeMcGarren> braid
[6:21:39] <UnfilteredComic> Who is th- NOPE
[6:21:41] <%CaptainPileDriver> i wish the late game sidequests weren't literally all dumped at the end
[6:21:49] <lotharrio> Oh, also why is it that you can't actually get a supermode?
[6:21:57] <DSD24> @silvery_cricket Character that is in your party for a while but then dies to the main villain
[6:21:57] <Haarute> SECOND GIG
[6:22:02] <thunderhog> SECOND GIG TIME
[6:22:05] <HolisticField> NEW GAME PLUS LETS GO
[6:22:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> no new game plus sadly
[6:22:10] <SomersaultJustice> parent dlc when
[6:22:11] <lotharrio> And why isn't there an index that explains any of the setting?
[6:22:11] <hassanico2> We never got any explanations about Ajna's mom
[6:22:23] <+machinetoys> wait who was the girl on the dog?
[6:22:23] <%CaptainPileDriver> it's just new game
[6:22:28] <+silvery_cricket> @DSD24 Aerith? Why is he calling her that?
[6:22:33] <+ConLin_Arts_> his daughter
[6:22:38] <solidoutlaw> his daughter from when he was a vajra or something
[6:22:44] <+ConLin_Arts_> he was reincarnated as a dog because he was dumb
[6:22:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> @machinetoys the dogs daughter cause he's her father reincarnated
[6:22:52] <jfp4life> Revanavar needed ore screen time imo
[6:22:52] <+RowenCleric> so guy with the gun is Ajna's dad right?
[6:22:53] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Nothing new here. saddly
[6:22:54] <DSD24> @silvery_cricket Wasn't Aeris her first name but then it got changed to Aerith later?
[6:22:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> yes
[6:23:08] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @machinetoys an Ashura child who Ajna found in Ashwat after she destroyed Lhan. turns out doggo is her reincarnated dad
[6:23:09] <Andrei11Droasca> Shit early 2020 got FF7 ,RE3 ,Doom,Cyberpunk and i only got money for 1 BibleThump
[6:23:10] <+xx123manxx> The same reason Cidney was changed to Cindy in ff15
[6:23:19] <Aruist> Ajna is a bit of a Mary Sue, and even at the point where her flaws are supposed to be called out, it’s practically glossed over
[6:23:19] <DSD24> Ajna's nom didn't get anything
[6:23:20] <+silvery_cricket> @DSD24 Is this a Canada thing she has always been named Aerith?
[6:23:23] <thunderhog> @solidoutlaw For the record, a Vajra is that little tool on the dogs neck.
[6:23:24] <UnfilteredComic> Needs some QoL
[6:23:25] <Prevot> Cidney > Cindy IMO
[6:23:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> adding the full main roster finally.
[6:23:34] <+ClaudeMcGarren> yo who are those dudes?
[6:23:34] <Picia000123> I am playing the shit out of CP2077
[6:23:46] <+FrostedZaibatsu> eevisuZ1 eevisuZ1 eevisuZ2 KappaPride
[6:23:48] <%CaptainPileDriver> cause there are 2 base game characters still not in this game yet
[6:23:49] <+ClaudeMcGarren> @Picia000123 you aint the only one man
[6:23:56] <+ConLin_Arts_> Banannavar
[6:23:56] <DSD24> @silvery_cricket Well I recently played FF7 on switch and Aerith's name at the start is Aeris
[6:23:58] <+Sulfur_Boride> Did young Indr get cancer or something? Why did his hair and skin color change again?
[6:24:01] <+stagemage> it being an unfinished game is super obvious. and it also has complete shit pacing
[6:24:03] <lotharrio> Killing Ravanavar too early was a problem, too.
[6:24:04] <+machinetoys> I forgot thanks
[6:24:06] <+Archmortal> Aeris/Aerith was a localization hiccup. the s and th use the same character iirc so they guessed which would sound better phonetically
[6:24:17] <Magoloso> me too Reg
[6:24:18] <Picia000123> I am glad Woolie and Reggie enjoyed it

[6:26:52] <+ClaudeMcGarren> @CaptainPileDriver LUL
[6:26:58] <BearSawed> little is pat
[6:27:07] <lotharrio> Sentient, not sapient

[6:27:59] <HolisticField> @BallerSwagBro9k the rumor is come out
[6:28:00] <toshuapoint0> Did something happened between Pat and Woolie because I didn't know if Pat is something we shouldn't mention.
[6:28:05] <Picia000123> Bye fellas, it was a blast
[6:28:06] <Andrei11Droasca> Pat is a bicy boy from a bicy gang
[6:28:08] <+TheFaustianMan> he probably needs a kiss.
[6:28:15] <+BallerSwagBro9k> See you Space Cowboy
[6:28:21] <+TheFaustianMan> it's not uncommon for two men on a couch to kiss either.
[6:28:23] <BearSawed> pat is fine
[6:28:33] <NarcissistCactus> pat is never fine
[6:28:37] <HolisticField> nothing gay about smooching your bro
[6:28:38] <%KoyFoster> We are done.
[6:28:40] <%CaptainPileDriver> pat is just an idiot who keeps screwing up his sleeping schedule
[6:28:47] <abelincoln_catpuncher> it's not gay if it's your bro
[6:28:50] <jorniev> ZUBAZ
[6:28:50] <lotharrio> Sacrifice time to get more time on the clock!
[6:28:51] <extradopeness> Wait yeah wasn’t the podcast supposed to be today?
[6:28:55] <+RowenCleric> You guys both did really good with it though, so pat yourself on the back
[6:28:58] <SomersaultJustice> pat should stream himself staying up too late
[6:28:59] <+Hasmeister96> OK now get celebratory pizza
[6:29:02] <%CaptainPileDriver> planes got delayed so they said wednesday
[6:29:05] <Mvrdok_> @toshuapoint0 If you have something to ask about Pat you can ask him directly at twitter
[6:29:09] <TheWashoutXY> Pat is busy grinding League for the season start on friday Kappa
[6:29:16] <BearSawed> pat is not idot, pat is child who cannot handle life
[6:29:17] <%LordSDB> Was delayed because of the airline issues I believe
[6:29:21] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @extradopeness yeah but Pat said he wasn't feeling good after MagFest
[6:29:22] <%Sartastic> woolie's pretty cool tho
[6:29:22] <Prevot> no one should ever mention pat, in any context
[6:29:32] <extradopeness> Oh I didn’t check Twitter today
[6:29:38] <+Hasmeister96> Wait did Pat go somewhere?
[6:29:46] <toshuapoint0> @Mvrdok_ Pat actually responds on Twitter. Didn't know.
[6:29:52] <Andrei11Droasca> Pat was behind it all along!
[6:29:54] <%LordSDB> Both of them came back from MagFest
[6:29:55] <+RowenCleric> Pat went to magfest right?
[6:30:05] <zayasu> @extradopeness DONT check twitter monkaS
[6:30:16] <+Hasmeister96> Did they take different planes?
[6:30:20] <StarlitStunner> Was Pat the dog in Silent Hill’s dog ending?
[6:30:20] <+TheFaustianMan> Look at them, he's trying to act like he's listening but those eyes say, KISS ME YOU MAGCIFICENT BAS TARD! <3
[6:30:24] <lotharrio> It's vaguely a platformer.
[6:30:36] <BearSawed> dog is too tall to pat
[6:30:36] <zayasu> @TheFaustianMan cmonBruh
[6:30:52] <%gatorafan> The cat could have been Bat Time, but it wasn't
[6:31:00] <+TheFaustianMan> I mean, I would let woolie kiss me. and I'm not gay, I just appriciate beautiful talented men.

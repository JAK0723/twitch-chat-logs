[2:18:48] <BreakersAweigh> one of my biggest issues with this game was the lack of fast travel in between locations. so traveling back to baozhai's ship from mara's den takes forever
[2:19:13] <%Zanethepure> Zanethepure subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! How's it going Woolz, loved the GGIV interview. Everyone else felt a little premature on judging the game.

[2:35:42] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule

[2:36:10] <+tankusmaximus7> @prime_name Gonna teach Kala a “lesson”
[2:36:18] <prime_name> Oh good, he found Yan and Zarah.
[2:36:20] <thunderhog> Well technically 17 of those are all in your head so...
[2:36:27] <thunderhog> It's basicly just a really heavy package
[2:36:33] <thunderhog> ....woolie calling me out ISTANTLY
[2:36:40] <fist_wizard_jay> When your son turns you into a jobber
[2:36:48] <Mendin> Thorani actually left peacefully when Baz asked, everyone else got chucked out
[2:37:16] <fist_wizard_jay> instant jobber on camera
[2:37:22] <Graxe_> So if you give Baz a Raging Demon, he's at his most powerful?
[2:37:26] <Novillion> So he has stage fright?
[2:37:27] <+theAncopro> sure you want to
[2:37:30] <+theAncopro> its really not
[2:37:32] <@Solidus_113> now we get the good shit on defense
[2:37:38] <+JingKaisean> what's more divisive, this or DS?
[2:37:49] <fist_wizard_jay> this
[2:38:11] <fist_wizard_jay> the argument on the podcast between Pat and Woolie was substantially larger
[2:38:36] <oAznoUta> The Baz is Orange Cassidy
[2:38:42] <axelkaspar> equally divided, much larger variance for DS
[2:38:49] <thunderhog> Yeah cause pat'll take 5 years to say why he hates a thing
[2:38:50] <rosabellamelantha> DS is also really high quality even if you dislike it
[2:38:58] <rosabellamelantha> This however.....
[2:39:03] <rosabellamelantha> it LOOKS nice
[2:39:25] <fist_wizard_jay> @woolieversus Ypu excited to see if Baz is in the new King Knight story coming Dec 10th?
[2:39:31] <fist_wizard_jay> you*
[2:39:44] <+LucidProtean> Just got here, better make a good first impression. uh... Fuck Dhar?
[2:39:49] <@Solidus_113> do it
[2:40:06] <rosabellamelantha> Dhar did nothing wrong
[2:40:11] <rosabellamelantha> he caused less misery than ajna
[2:40:31] <KZN02> Carrying a bundle of sticks
[2:40:32] <DedlokPM> @fist_wizard_jay thing is, this was divisive for Pat and Woolie, but Death Stranding is something that ould definitely be up both of their allies. I would say that for most people, Death Stranding would be more divisive as it is more likely to be on people's radars than this.
[2:40:49] <prime_name> BEST BOY
[2:40:52] <@Solidus_113> PUPPER

[2:58:11] <thunderhog> God damn woolie with the TODS
[2:58:13] <%Jordan_z123> “ That’s what we like to call big damage “
[2:58:24] <@Solidus_113> remember that now you have your megaman dash
[2:58:30] <@Solidus_113> everything will be faster
[2:58:40] <+KawaiiJetty> Do mixup do combo do big number
[2:59:04] <rosabellamelantha> @WoolieVersus you can skip half the trek back up if you stick yo the outside
[2:59:05] <fist_wizard_jay> the goat told ya to fuck off Woolz
[3:00:18] <@Solidus_113> Arceus?
[3:00:41] <BreakersAweigh> wow he pronounced it correctly
[3:01:05] <BreakersAweigh> i was saying "ar-see-us" for YEARS
[3:02:25] <fist_wizard_jay> English is wierd
[3:02:40] <fist_wizard_jay> and its my main language
[3:03:01] <scoopyoopydoo> the tgc commercial always said PLATINUM AR-SEE-US tho
[3:03:02] <$Hmmmm_Nice_Bike> Long story short it was the inspiration for Mortal Kombat Shaolin Monks
[3:03:11] <prime_name> Are you trying to say that Wu Tang ain't nothing to fuck with?
[3:03:17] <AMaidIndeed> is that why they got the Two Hands?
[3:03:38] <ManlyMcBeefington> map?
[3:04:06] <rosabellamelantha> Leilani is so good
[3:04:12] <rosabellamelantha> I literally never swapped her out
[3:04:14] <+steelmorrigan> You mean the man with te hiron fists right?
[3:04:27] <+steelmorrigan> Man with the iron MAsk is a Musketeers novel >.> <.<
[3:04:27] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[3:04:34] <Mendin> Oh hey Woolie got the airdash
[3:04:35] <%AlcoholicBlackGuy> monkaS
[3:04:36] <+theAncopro> uHm
[3:04:37] <bevyrage> 0:
[3:04:40] <%AlcoholicBlackGuy> HE WANTS DUFFS
[3:04:45] <Novillion> yo that looks badass
[3:04:51] <CharlesRobinJr> new to the indivisible stream how does combat work
[3:04:54] <rosabellamelantha> Double?
[3:05:09] <fist_wizard_jay> SATAN LOVES MAGIC
[3:05:11] <KZN02> Not hentai enough
[3:05:19] <+JacktheMan18> Who's the cutie with the chainsaw sword?
[3:05:21] <rosabellamelantha> He's weak as hell though
[3:05:27] <fist_wizard_jay> Or wait
[3:05:28] <@Solidus_113> You could probably do Razmi's down attack if nothing else
[3:05:30] <Mendin> Each character is a button, they get action points that fill up ATB style, each button can be neutral, up+button, or down+Button
[3:05:32] <rosabellamelantha> that's Leilani, an optional party member
[3:05:34] <fist_wizard_jay> is that Janemba?
[3:05:36] <@Solidus_113> SHIT
[3:05:36] <DedlokPM> HERE'S DA BIG WAN
[3:05:42] <Mendin> You got super meter shared, and you got combo bonuses
[3:05:53] <CMZ3> her down attack
[3:06:00] <KZN02> Her down attack heals the boss too
[3:06:10] <+JacktheMan18> @rosabellamelantha thanks
[3:06:16] <bevyrage> likely because you're too close to a wall
[3:06:23] <fist_wizard_jay> ANY magic heals this guy
[3:06:28] <DedlokPM> Leilani is such a cute
[3:06:33] <fist_wizard_jay> truth
[3:06:42] <@Solidus_113> I think your air dash is any direction
[3:06:48] <Mendin> Any further questions about the combat @CharlesRobinJr ?
[3:07:00] <UnfilteredComic> @Solidus_113 shhh, not yet it isnt
[3:07:01] <CatmanIX> @WoolieVersus razmi's down attack is a status curse, not a physical hit if that's what you're thinking
[3:07:10] <CMZ3> ^
[3:07:10] <CharlesRobinJr> nope thanks @Mendin
[3:07:11] <Mendin> It does a little damage, Catman
[3:07:22] <Mendin> Cheers
[3:07:24] <fuzz9369> I really need to get this game
[3:07:48] <Mendin> Take your time, fuzz, we're waiting on a content patch that'll add some stuff missing from several characters
[3:07:49] <MindlessMonks> Chesterr with the strats
[3:07:53] <Mendin> But do get it eventually
[3:08:08] <KZN02> Go right
[3:08:46] <+theAncopro> wait what's missing that they're adding
[3:08:47] <MindlessMonks> 4
[3:08:52] <MegaQuint> 4 was the hover
[3:08:56] <KZN02> You should probably switch Razmi to Ginseng and Honey in case you fight another magic absorbing enemy'
[3:09:35] <fist_wizard_jay> tbh for me Ginseng was a staple choice
[3:09:37] <Nested_Dreams> That was a sick one-round fight
[3:09:45] <Mendin> Leilani, Phoebe, and Yan all are missing supers, for one
[3:09:48] <prime_name> Tiger!
[3:09:57] <fist_wizard_jay> never swapped em out, except to try out Thorani for a smidge
[3:10:14] <spardanwarrior> Adding the guest characters, the backer characters, and the two characters from the standard roster who are still in the oven.
[3:10:16] <CMZ3> her grab into lvl 3 does more damage
[3:10:25] <Mendin> And Montreal Summer is construction mafia time
[3:10:31] <fist_wizard_jay> lol
[3:11:16] <+theAncopro> oh yea i remember hearing about the guest characters, I thought i missed them
[3:11:24] <prime_name> It's been a second
[3:11:37] <fist_wizard_jay> I know the feeling Woolie, Chicago gets fucking plastered in snow sometimes
[3:11:37] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:11:49] <Tempmael> we live? nice
[3:12:07] <prime_name> Digging Woolie's keyboard
[3:12:11] <DedlokPM> also some characters are missing supers that they are going to add later
[3:12:28] <fist_wizard_jay> Not as much as Montreal, but enough that the city spends a shitload of money for plows and salt
[3:12:32] <+chesterr01> @mindlessmonks HeyGuys
[3:12:50] <MindlessMonks> @chesterr01 lol im dead

[3:21:46] <DedlokPM> Mefense of Beh Ancients

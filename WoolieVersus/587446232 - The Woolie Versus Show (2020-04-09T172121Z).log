[0:05:38] <+Grizzytron> Manga readers sound off
[0:05:43] <Klefth> Oh, this is gonna be GOOD.
[0:05:45] <BallerSwagBro9k> 1
[0:05:46] <TheArrow_> I love how almost every noteworthy indie game has a bangin' soundtrack
[0:05:48] <+arcielardor> place your bets!
[0:06:09] <theyseemerowling> any idea what time the stream's starting?
[0:06:12] <phatmac16> One of them isn’t coming back alive
[0:06:23] <OldManDeckardCain> my prediction: reggie will win the whole thing because woolie and minh will be too busy fucking with each other LUL
[0:06:47] <oyyzzo> the time is now
[0:06:50] <BallerSwagBro9k> @oldmandeckardcain Honestly thats the best ending
[0:06:53] <TheArrow_> woolie and minh will be too busy fucking with each other to care about reggie, but reggie will still lose due to bad luck
[0:06:54] <%andrei11dr> So FF7 is fucking great, also hy everyone!
[0:06:55] <+chikitsune9> Salt Party
[0:06:59] <Klefth> I miss them's fighting herds
[0:06:59] <%ekodrop> reggie has incentive to stay in last now
[0:07:04] <Zebroneath> There will be blood
[0:07:07] <Klefth> Hell, I miss playing games with friends. :/
[0:07:17] <yeetdabsenpai69> @OldManDeckardCain im suspecting whoever lands the last blow on th endboss wins cause noone was collecting towns in the meantime
[0:07:18] <+tealplague> ah shit here we go again
[0:07:21] <jaygee303> Wonder what Minh will do this time
[0:07:39] <%Kriss1827> what are the odds reggie doesnt win and gets 2nd place by 1gold at the end
[0:07:41] <+gustavozxd> time for hatred
[0:07:54] <INDECISIVEjew> My prediction is that Woolie will continue to do much better than the other two, but the problem is that doing so puts a huge target on your back, and Dokapon is extremely difficult to get through with people teaming up on you
[0:07:56] <Maleicus> they havent started yet?
[0:08:15] <Theravingjesus> Mihns gonna be stirring all the shit today can't wait!!!
[0:08:16] <BallerSwagBro9k> Man Pat goes live with FF7 in 30 minutes
[0:08:27] <Klefth> Dokapon, tho
[0:08:35] <yeetdabsenpai69> @Kriss1827 impossible the game ends with whoever beats the endboss getting AL towns that are yet to be claimed
[0:08:38] <Reizie_Etherealm> Will Reggie trade his good person angel's halo for a guilty crown? Will woolie finally trigger his SDT? Will Minh's resolve to be a heel shatter due to the bitch in his heart?
[0:08:39] <jubejube56> Look whose back
[0:08:40] <@Solidus_113> why would you ever watch FF7 as the first experience
[0:08:49] <jaygee303> @ballerswagbro9k This will be better for salt tho
[0:08:50] <jubejube56> Dok-a-pon
[0:08:53] <+soundcloud_raptor> is the last youtube of this the last bit from the previous stream?

[0:09:05] <%andrei11dr> At the beginning of every stream, will need to take bets on if a murder is going to happen live
[0:09:10] <gunsrlove> why would you ever watch Pat Kappa

[0:29:09] <+Dimfish> LMAO
[0:29:16] <%GeneralSCPatton> Barter is inefficient. Currency solves several problems with it.
[0:29:17] <Superdandy96> Reggie wants the Commi way to return
[0:29:17] <khetrak> KH has the best name for it, munny
[0:29:19] <zedravan> just use copper coins it is anti bacterial
[0:29:20] <%INDECISIVEjew> Bartering is trash for introverts. They'll all starve

[0:29:25] <@Solidus_113> Don't forget about that guy who traded up a pen for a expensive car
[0:29:27] <wendisky> Gold standard?
[0:29:33] <+MrRabbles> bartering falls apart on a global scale
[0:29:34] <DRAGKUDO> but that person is now either dead or faraway
[0:29:36] <johnnydalmann> so we make districts @woolieversus
[0:29:46] <jevichrono> How much I missed and how much is the Blood pool now?
[0:29:51] <donstylo> I think stealing is the best payment system.
[0:29:51] <gekizenbu> currency is very convienient
[0:29:53] <+Dimfish> bartering falls apart at the city state level, not even global
[0:29:54] <+paladinstarbuster> RUPEES
[0:30:00] <$StaceMcGate> @jevichrono not much, and over $200
[0:30:09] <Superdandy96> Me likey gems
[0:30:12] <emperordread> Minh is literally describing how money came to be. Seasonal or irregular trades like getting wool or fish meant long periods where you can't barter because you don't have your goods to trade, so you get cash which preseves value
[0:30:13] <+l33t_j4gu4r> meal ready to eat
[0:30:15] <GoldeNOVA> I'll give you five bananas for a copy of Bloodborne
[0:30:24] <wendisky> Mad max has bullets
[0:30:28] <%GeneralSCPatton> With barter, you have to find someone who has what you want AND wants what you have. That's a problem.

[0:51:00] <NickHatesSnow> YEYYEEYEYEY
[0:51:02] <%Mendin> Do not segregate the pools. Simply reserve 1/5th of the Blood Pool as the "transfusion" for the destroyed loser
[0:51:05] <SomersaultJustice> someone send them a wig
[0:51:09] <jevichrono> ... Losers wear Merch.
[0:51:13] <+Dimfish> you'll be able to buy a wig with your winnings

[1:12:12] <%ekodrop> @GeneralSCPatton The peacepool should have been split amonst the three of them in that case. that way it eliminates the chance of the peacepool being a greater incentive.

[2:20:23] <%Th3SmartAlec> RISEEEEEEE
[2:20:26] <%Solidnick18> FailFish
[2:20:26] <privatesargent> magic can't be dodged, it can only be defended with defensive magic which is deteremined by the magic stat
[2:20:32] <%Th3SmartAlec> @jevichrono shhhh
[2:20:33] <%jiggy_snipe> if Minh used the contract, it would put him in last place
[2:20:37] <flyingtentaclemonster> Pull your devil trigger Reggie!
[2:20:39] <Zalthia> If he uses the contract, doesn’t he loose everything?
[2:20:39] <privatesargent> so his low magic ability means he is easily killed by magic
[2:20:44] <+paladinstarbuster> ITS NOT FINE
[2:20:44] <crimsonsaens> Yeah
[2:20:48] <flyingtentaclemonster> Oh, now Minh has Devil Trigger?
[2:20:50] <+pectusumbra> Cast Death Call on Minh!

[2:21:34] <jevichrono> Jobs is literally jobbing
[2:21:35] <+Gespens> Bug is an item, not a curse
[2:21:39] <alephalpha> it's a cursed item not a cruse
[2:21:40] <TheArrow_> "I want to die so I can fight the grim reaper"
[2:21:40] <yeetdabsenpai69> that cursed ITEMS
[2:21:42] <privatesargent> killing adventureres only give exp when you have less exp then the one you killed
[2:21:42] <Idon__> That's a cursed item, not a curse itself
[2:21:46] <yeetdabsenpai69> ITEEEEEMS
[2:21:47] <%Solidnick18> yes

[2:22:28] <jevichrono> Minhformation
[2:22:30] <binkarus> @idon__ trust your instinct
[2:22:33] <privatesargent> Minh keeps giving the wrong information to everybody and they keep BELIEVING
[2:22:40] <Riottrio> and actually use items/field magic every turn
[2:22:48] <Doodle_Taco> Yo Reggie should change into a thief to steal Woolie's Mix-up

[2:23:35] <yeetdabsenpai69> but in combat mag doesnt miss
[2:23:38] <sexdrugsvideogames> why attack minh? woolie is weaker

[2:23:49] <+nintega010> minh can't use contrect

[2:23:53] <%jiggy_snipe> combat magic is different
[2:23:54] <yeetdabsenpai69> green chest!
[2:23:57] <crimsonsaens> Enemy level doesn't affect job level gain
[2:24:01] <jevichrono> Just battle
[2:24:03] <privatesargent> in combat, magic doesn't miss and the only stat that matters to damage is both players magic stat

[2:24:16] <abbock> @privatesargent magic can miss, stop lying
[2:24:22] <privatesargent> thats why magic builds can be so powerful
[2:24:23] <%andrei11dr> Get towns
[2:24:25] <kingkeldeo31> You can't use contract unless you have the bat floating above you
[2:24:26] <Xeno351> as long as minh has the contract i don't think reggie can get another i believe
[2:24:30] <Riottrio> @abbock field magic can miss, magic in battle always hits
[2:24:31] <Idon__> one shot holy shit
[2:24:41] <abbock> I have 200+ hours in Dokapon Kingdom. combat magic can miss.
[2:24:42] <sexdrugsvideogames> NICE
[2:24:54] <yeetdabsenpai69> @abbock your thinking of abbilities
[2:25:00] <Idon__> "I'm helping society" he says as his bug steals reggie's shit
[2:25:06] <+kekkerscrew> Spinner
[2:25:06] <Klefth> Soul mop?
[2:25:13] <+pectusumbra> 2 spinner
[2:25:14] <Riottrio> @abbock I have more, but you are totally wrong. The bottom slot is not magic, its abilities, and those can miss
[2:25:15] <crimsonsaens> "Offensive Magic uses Magic to deal damage to and potentially debuff the opponent. Unlike Attack and Strike, spells cannot miss, although the spell's damage can be decreased or negated with Defensive Magic. " from the wiki
[2:25:15] <Mrthefro> Minh is what you sound like when you're winning, Woolie.
[2:25:29] <%Th3SmartAlec> NICE
[2:25:32] <moonologist> wow

[2:25:38] <+Pookiedaexzile> I just realized this game was rigged from the start....Minh is thhe grind King
[2:25:38] <Riottrio> @abbock say an enemy uses "quake", that is not a battle spell, it is a seperate option, and thus can be dodged

[2:27:30] <Riottrio> @yeetdabsenpai69 I agree, if you are pure magic and steam roll the human players, you basically win the game. Especially because by steam rolling, you get best equipment and so you can attack against enemies that do have bounce/magic defense qualities
[2:27:30] <kingkeldeo31> They know about churches right?
[2:27:31] <%andrei11dr> Go to volcano Woolie
[2:27:40] <Xeno351> does he not know he can use them on monsters?
[2:27:44] <crimsonsaens> Just use it on a town monster
[2:27:49] <Riottrio> @yeetdabsenpai69 but arguably same can be said about pure speed builds I suppose
[2:28:02] <LeafarOznolam> you do know that you can use that on monsters @woolieversus
[2:28:06] <+agumon9000> Reggie give into satsui no hado
[2:28:09] <%Th3SmartAlec> That's 6 away
[2:28:10] <+agumon9000> BECOME DARKLING
[2:28:10] <alephalpha> magic builds have never failed me
[2:28:10] <%jiggy_snipe> @jevichrono when Reggie used the 1st Darkling, he had nothing at all. Now he has a couple towns because he actually started to play. He also got some levels from the Darkling shenaniganas
[2:28:13] <+Pookiedaexzile> CONTRACT
[2:28:13] <worldbrand> LUL
[2:28:20] <sexdrugsvideogames> reggie, woolies tnt goes off when you hit him...
[2:28:23] <+paladinstarbuster> MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE USED THE contract
[2:28:23] <%MaddyCaddy> Volcano!
[2:28:26] <alephalpha> plus the alchemist trick lets you win without a single town
[2:28:32] <GoldeNOVA> Reggie use the Behelit! SwiftRage
[2:28:35] <+Kduff89> minh has the confidence of a jojo villian rn
[2:28:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> Ooof
[2:28:41] <fetrigon> "this does put a smile on my face..."
[2:28:44] <sexdrugsvideogames> woolie vs pat
[2:28:46] <Riottrio> @jiggy_snipe towns are meaningless, you can get more towns that will be better in later continents. Being behind in levels is way worse
[2:28:46] <emperordread> Egg of the Conqueror
[2:28:54] <Idon__> GAMBLE IT WOOLIE
[2:28:54] <yeetdabsenpai69> @alephalpha untill someonee beats you and steals the money

[2:29:14] <Idon__> DON'T BACK DOWN THIS TIME
[2:29:14] <moonologist> STRIKE
[2:29:14] <NeroInfinite> GAMBLE
[2:29:17] <Riottrio> Woolie should totally use drain more often
[2:29:17] <sexdrugsvideogames> listen to your heart
[2:29:17] <%Th3SmartAlec> And you'll heal
[2:29:18] <jevichrono> When you got nothing to lose, you can only fall so flat. Falling a lot more from losing a lot more.
[2:29:19] <TigerClaws12> S T R I K E
[2:29:21] <%Th3SmartAlec> OHHHH
[2:29:21] <Riottrio> like right now would be great
[2:29:22] <Idon__> yeeyeyeyeyeye
[2:29:25] <%Th3SmartAlec> YEYEYEYE
[2:29:35] <sexdrugsvideogames> nice
[2:29:41] <%GenesisKnight> BUMP THAT SPEED
[2:29:42] <nocturne_reverie> open your heart, it'll be alright
[2:29:43] <%Livelinne> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[2:29:46] <moonologist> minh mind games
[2:29:48] <alephalpha> @yeetdabsenpai69 so if you store the money as items to the king you can't lose it
[2:30:01] <+fateirony> what a tanky cleric
[2:30:06] <%Th3SmartAlec> 1
[2:30:07] <yeetdabsenpai69> but you ned towns to get items the king wants?
[2:30:09] <TheAuraBlaze252> USE THE POWER OF DARKNESS
[2:30:10] <+nintega010> warrior goes to ninja
[2:30:20] <+Taglog7> ti catch corona is my real test
[2:30:24] <alephalpha> you only need one
[2:30:26] <+l33t_j4gu4r> secret pokemon master job
[2:30:26] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1247403021576876032?s=20
[2:30:27] <%andrei11dr> Should've got magic since his a cleric now
[2:30:27] <%Th3SmartAlec> use the cystal now
[2:30:29] <%jiggy_snipe> @Riottrio which being a Darkling for a bit helped. He was really far behind in levels before he started "grinding" and attacking towns with Darkling powers
[2:30:37] <privatesargent> the big bug doesn't always take items each turn
[2:30:40] <+agumon9000> :)
[2:30:44] <crimsonsaens> Contract is only usable by last place3
[2:30:46] <nachohangovers> No you have to be in last to use a contract.
[2:30:51] <yeetdabsenpai69> @alephalpha samething as before 1 fight and you got no town
[2:30:55] <chickenhunter> nah the contract teleports you to the space and can only be used by last place
[2:30:57] <yeetdabsenpai69> DARKLINGDOM
[2:30:58] <khetrak> FIGHT HIM
[2:30:59] <+paladinstarbuster> get that town
[2:31:01] <Klefth> Steal it from Mihn
[2:31:15] <kingkeldeo31> Contract only works when you have the bat above you
[2:31:16] <Riottrio> @jiggy_snipe I think I misunderstood you, I think you are also in agreement that being a Darkling now would be beneficial and I misunderstood that
[2:31:21] <%andrei11dr> It's always good to have
[2:31:21] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> The contract teleports you to the darkspace
[2:31:26] <Gramcracker55> In a pinch you could become the darkling the hard way.
[2:31:34] <sexdrugsvideogames> why not use contract?
[2:31:36] <privatesargent> you have to have the bat thing to become a darkling, and you need the contract to teleport or else you need to manually go the the darkspace
[2:31:41] <crimsonsaens> Might as well sell everything
[2:31:46] <TigerClaws12> cause he's in 1st place
[2:31:53] <crimsonsaens> The bug will eat them regardless
[2:31:53] <Malik1002> Reggie did you change your job
[2:31:56] <yeetdabsenpai69> @sexdrugsvideogames cowardice and idiocrasy
[2:31:59] <Idon__> HUGE WEAPONS

[2:32:28] <+pectusumbra> Soul Mop was red, couldn't be used
[2:32:31] <alephalpha> @yeetdabsenpai69 well yes but while playing the game you're never gonna be behind long enougha nd in most cases you're gonna be out of the way for mos tplayers
[2:32:35] <+agumon9000> Woolie you can buy better shield for more defense
[2:32:37] <fakkuza> ah

[2:34:47] <alephalpha> @Riottrio it works pretty well against players as all you need really is levels and one town at a time I mean if th ethree othe rplayers gang up on you and don't try to complete the game yes but that would kinda be the case regardles
[2:34:50] <privatesargent> Reggie refuses to take risks
[2:34:59] <%jiggy_snipe> it will disappear when you have nothing left
[2:34:59] <Superdandy96> Reggie
[2:35:09] <Drunkengen> Reggie refuses to gain more power
[2:35:17] <Superdandy96> Reggie, your good nature will be your downfall

[2:40:46] <Riottrio> honestly, Reggies best play right now would be to buy better equipment, then head for darklingdom
[2:40:49] <Daba_mk2> do it
[2:40:49] <sexdrugsvideogames> Minh is such a good guy, when he didn't need an item anymore he gave it to Reggie
[2:40:55] <Klefth> CRYME TYME
[2:40:57] <yeetdabsenpai69> why are you buying stuff when you could just steal it
[2:40:59] <%MaddyCaddy> He can't go into towns
[2:41:02] <Riottrio> spend the money he's going to lose anyway on equipment he'll get back after hes done being darkling
[2:41:05] <TigerClaws12> Reggie is too pure :(
[2:41:10] <jevichrono> Cue Baddest!

[2:44:44] <Mrthefro> But it was actually the right choice for Reggie since he was gonna die anyaway.
[2:44:46] <khetrak> reggie in your fight with minh, there was no reason to do anything but counter and you didn't do it
[2:44:46] <+kekkerscrew> Counter is Hype when it connects that's why
[2:44:46] <privatesargent> we have all been saying give up, and before then most of us have been saying use magic more
[2:44:46] <+RowenCleric> Reggie sounds so dead inside Im scared all
[2:44:50] <Idon__> never not risk everything
[2:44:51] <%andrei11dr> Yea you dumbo :)

[2:48:20] <Riottrio> @alephalpha totally agree, but I am also of the mindset that Darklings are always a good idea, unless you are literally last chapter, then you should probably just go for kill steals

[3:02:52] <%RioGascar> Save state?
[3:02:52] <%Livelinne> It’s fiiiiine
[3:02:55] <LeafarOznolam> ooofff
[3:02:55] <flyingtentaclemonster> Happens with legitimate 15 year old hardware, we understand
[3:02:57] <%thunderhog> lytWORRY
[3:02:57] <jevichrono> Yeag
[3:02:57] <%Th3SmartAlec> REGGIE
[3:03:01] <%Solidnick18> oh nooo
[3:03:05] <binkarus> It happened after reggie's fight finished. I think it lagged and caused the desync problem
[3:03:06] <pappyvanpoodle> Arthritis grandma on the turntable
[3:03:07] <Foopoof> oof
[3:03:11] <%andrei11dr> I wonder if it's a frequency thing
[3:03:13] <LeafarOznolam> oh noooo
[3:03:16] <SixthSun2> Sounded like it was the game, not you guys
[3:03:17] <%jiggy_snipe> does Woolie's bell go to his phone?
[3:03:20] <%Livelinne> Oh no
[3:03:25] <binkarus> like game lag caused the audio to trip up
[3:03:25] <TigerClaws12> it was the game
[3:03:31] <Junkles> voice audio was fine. game audio was stuttery
[3:03:35] <%andrei11dr> I hope it wasn't something important
[3:03:37] <NickHatesSnow> Drink some water
[3:03:37] <%FuqBoiSlim> I dont like how that chat is implying that woolie would...ugh emulate...we only game on the legit hardware here..
[3:03:40] <Junkles> game video was fine I think
[3:03:47] <$legacy0117> Well, at least you guys are having fun, and not completely salted out. ^^
[3:03:54] <+FaderPotater> Reggie allowed it to tilt woolie, his heart is corrupted
[3:03:58] <sexdrugsvideogames> rom on virtual console?
[3:03:58] <Casinoroyale80> POWER UP
[3:04:02] <Riottrio> this manga has filler? Or does the anime just skip over content?
[3:04:08] <binku_muja_> As people are saying, it seemed to be the game at fault.
[3:04:09] <TigerClaws12> it was the emulator proably, it happens
[3:04:16] <jevichrono> Anime skips content
[3:04:18] <%Solidnick18> ok

[0:30:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> so how's those Tabs eating up memory?
[0:30:28] <Darren716> Woolie how do you get updates then?
[0:30:30] <black_pariah> i have the opposite problem, usually
[0:30:30] <%Javaa01> Windows Server is meant for long sessions
[0:30:30] <derap41> Did you have a cheap ass PSU?
[0:30:37] <sparkly_yoyo> My cousin got a warning because his laptop had been on for a month, I didn't even know that warning existed

[0:30:44] <+linSP> My computer hasn‚Äôt slept for 5 years
[0:31:02] <lord_campbell96> Just wanna say I love that you have been getting into variety stuff and playing off the wall games its so fun to watch
[0:31:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> @th3smartalec Chrome hungers for more
[0:31:06] <derap41> Windows 10 is pretty good about updating without having to restart these days
[0:31:14] <%ExpressNode> I turn my computer off everytime I don't use it
[0:31:19] <black_pariah> i restart just to restart sometimes
[0:31:21] <cheerfulnpc> That's weird as fuck, the opposite happens for me. Restarting the PC fixes everything for me.
[0:31:23] <derap41> You PSU is shit ass probably
[0:31:27] <%Th3SmartAlec> @generalscpatton THE LORD HUNGERS
[0:31:31] <$BallerSwagBro9k> You can disable updates witjout keeping youyr PC on tho
[0:31:31] <%Javaa01> Yeah don't do sleep and hybernate
[0:31:36] <%RedoctoberWolf> I need to reformat so bad

[0:31:53] <lord_campbell96> lionThrow THE LORD HUNGERS lionThrow
[0:31:58] <%ExpressNode> Hold on didn't Woolie talk about this exact thing a few years ago on the podcast. I'm getting a weird sense of deja vu
[0:32:02] <sparkly_yoyo> I just turn it off, no wishy washy bullshit
[0:32:10] <ghoulishcripple> i have that same premise with my ps4pro. it only likes rest mode
[0:32:23] <black_pariah> as someone who went to pc repair school, i feel youre 100 percent wrong, but i cant tell you youre wrong
[0:32:26] <ghoulishcripple> i power off and it boots with a glitch or issue
[0:32:26] <%Solidnick18> my shit is just shit
[0:32:34] <%jiggy_snipe> @ExpressNode he's talked about this multiple times. Podcasts, LPs, etc.
[0:32:36] <CappuccinoGuil> I mean, my computer in my room, I need darkness and silence to sleep LUL
[0:32:37] <derap41> "Works on my PC"

[0:32:49] <%valiard> Just in time
[0:32:51] <+Superbro64> If you can stand the electric bill of keeping stuff on, sure. But I don't have the funds for that sort of thing.
[0:32:51] <Rhinoprotoss> Woolie vs technologu
[0:32:51] <%Javaa01> Hibernate basically makes a savestate of your RAM and shuts down completely, and loads the state when you boot next time, and that's not good for a PC
[0:32:52] <%DakotaMacDoodle> I do the same woolie
[0:32:53] <%krispen_wa> Is this the Luddite Woolie arc?
[0:32:55] <%Chatterbox1991> what your discribing is why i bought my Cybergaming Rig as opposed to building
[0:33:07] <BearSawed> @derap41 Ohhhhhhh you that kind of guy hugh?
[0:33:09] <+Superbro64> Especially with the ac running. All electronics go off when I leave for work.
[0:33:13] <%Ozmodyas> Hi Woolie, used my Prime free trial to sub to you a little bit back. Wasn't sure how to send a sub message for the stream so I'm trying various things to see which works, feel free to ignore the extras: Don't know if this came up before, but Beldam's name isn't a pun on Bedlam but rather an existing english word that means witch/hag/crone, which supposedly comes from the French phrase "La Belle Dame sans Merci" ("The Sweet Lady without Mercy"). It's also the name of the monster from Coraline.
[0:33:15] <derap41> PC part have become way more robust in just these 20 years
[0:33:15] <CrematedCube> I'm not the same, but I sympathize with the paranoia
[0:33:15] <+MrAtheGreat> Those were good days, back when you had green\amber color text
[0:33:36] <CrematedCube> I actually watched S.E.Lain at your recommendation, it was darkly fun
[0:33:45] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @Ozmodyas Interesting
[0:33:51] <%krispen_wa> Have you tried turning it on and off again?
[0:33:53] <derap41> Barely have to worry about ESD these days
[0:33:53] <oadf_threestrikes> i didn't realize that sleep mode was so bad for the computer

[0:33:56] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> @Superbro64 AC yes, everything is is negligable. You might save a couple bucks a year at most lol

[0:34:20] <HotMafia81> my primary PC was once dead for months because a hold down tab in the USB-C port was shorting the whole PSU.
[0:34:21] <%GeneralSCPatton> @ozmodyas Neat, though that's not likely to reach him.
[0:34:23] <KaitlynnHere> I just watched my friend spend three hours trying to figure out why my windows app wouldn‚Äôt update
[0:34:23] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> hope you didn't fry your motherboard with static electricity!
[0:34:23] <@akuda_bar> this is why i just paid a guy to do it lol. so if he breaks it, he pays.

[0:34:50] <derap41> So you bought cheap PSU that explains a lot
[0:34:57] <%ExpressNode> The only thing I get nervous about is probably putting my my GPU then putting in the cables for the power
[0:34:57] <CrematedCube> Losing the magic smoke

[1:03:33] <%krispen_wa> Woolie speedrunning would just be his bloodborne playthrough
[1:03:34] <cheerfulnpc> Ya'll amateurs: you can't put the, that, an, etc. in front of the word updog- it ruins the person's response.

[1:04:51] <alexandrecau> not much to test it's just sweet treat
[1:04:53] <+Lazyjoules> not different
[1:04:56] <SoupBowler> Sweat Feast... no I mean, Sweet Fee- Fuck!
[1:05:05] <SoupBowler> Tilting left also works

[1:05:32] <Drusain> 5 stars tho

[1:05:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> Finally, some good fucking food
[1:05:38] <sparkly_yoyo> overkill
[1:05:39] <SoupBowler> It's 5 SP tho
[1:05:41] <%Papa_Bearman> Treat is done.
[1:05:41] <sparkly_yoyo> gud
[1:05:45] <%KyoryUtchy> Literally more than your max HP
[1:05:46] <straycatrock> i think it assumes youve been levelling ur hp and fp more than you have
[1:05:49] <%ozmon> VIOLENCE does 8 damage, so good
[1:05:49] <glass_marcus> Semi Auto
[1:05:50] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> 5
[1:05:53] <+linSP> sometimes you need a big heal tho
[1:05:55] <%afronooch> 5
[1:05:56] <SchwaAkari> Sweet Feast is the Occultist Wyrd Reconstruction of TTYD
[1:05:59] <%Papa_Bearman> Five.
[1:05:59] <penitentpentwitch> It's expensive, but it gives a lot of FP back
[1:06:00] <Bootkiller6> Costed 5, but you're so stylish who cares
[1:06:02] <%kyh9> It's a full heal tho
[1:06:03] <Bootkiller6> you'll fill it back
[1:06:03] <%chosenjuan42> With your low HP sweet treat is enough
[1:06:10] <fritz_dacat> Gotta get that Appeal up
[1:06:13] <cosmicgoatee> 5 Stars....Restaurant Quality
[1:06:14] <heartlesshealer> a lot of stars for what amounts to an Elixir
[1:06:17] <Daniel_Is_I> It's worth it though
[1:06:18] <NotHereToStream> comeback mechanic
[1:06:18] <%sunnythedrunk> It would be useful if you weren't BP fiends
[1:06:22] <edward11231> YES
[1:06:22] <+Euphbugg> Its good for the FP recovery
[1:06:23] <@CrankyVT> Better get stylish ' v'9
[1:06:23] <%krispen_wa> Using 2 sweet treats is way more efficient
[1:06:24] <noe_juan_kanobe> Lvl3 vs Lvl1 Super
[1:06:25] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> its RAW
[1:06:26] <sparkly_yoyo> it's better when you have more HP
[1:06:29] <SoupBowler> If you know how to manage resources, Sweet Treat for 1 SP is good enough
[1:06:31] <%Estuko> @crankyvt cranky5Pat <3
[1:06:31] <CrematedCube> Save up in tough fights
[1:06:32] <petwisk> not worthed
[1:06:34] <+Wilabeen1997> Big cost, big payout
[1:06:40] <%ozmon> And an average of 15 FP, so that's pretty big for more power in a long fight
[1:06:44] <+MrAtheGreat> For emergencies.
[1:06:47] <%GeneralSCPatton> @crankyvt cranky5Blush cranky5Hype cranky5Pat
[1:06:49] <Mr_Strut> But that's 4 stars and three turns
[1:06:54] <+MrAtheGreat> Better off just sweet treating every so often.
[1:06:57] <%relentingapunch> It's for doese big long fights
[1:06:57] <Sol_Install> it worth it tbh when shit dire
[1:07:01] <%chosenjuan42> your life SHROOM fills like 2/3 of your HP
[1:07:02] <shiny_prinny> if you slot in more HP Plus and FP Plus badges it might seem more useful
[1:07:03] <%relentingapunch> Also holy shit heys cranky
[1:07:04] <%Papa_Bearman> Did you notice that there was only one Poison Mushroom? It's less risk as well.
[1:07:07] <%Daniel_Is_I> It's 2-3 sweet treats in one turn
[1:07:10] <MagiKestral> take that arrow to Merlin asap
[1:07:12] <Sol_Install> plus that is 4 stars and wasting 3 turns yea
[1:07:13] <heartlesshealer> 5 stars & 1 turn as opposed to 4 stars & 3 turns
[1:07:17] <SoupBowler> Also keep in mind that items can heal you if you have lots of mushrooms and whatnot
[1:07:18] <JetpackMcQuack> kinamaHmm useless
[1:07:18] <BlackermanZX> if you dont have hp and fp and you cant wait more turns

[1:11:46] <%kyh9> Single turn
[1:11:46] <missingangle> It's just the Yoshi final smash
[1:11:48] <@CrankyVT> pretty a-four-dable
[1:11:48] <JetpackMcQuack> Kreygasm
[1:11:49] <@akuda_bar> One turn yes
[1:11:49] <SoupBowler> 4fp for that is really good

[1:11:49] <InfiniteScratch> VIOLENCE ARMY
[1:11:50] <+Euphbugg> 4 for another mario attack is amazing
[1:11:50] <%ringabal> BATON PASS
[1:11:50] <%ozmon> Mario's Partner is Mario
[1:11:50] <%relentingapunch> 100% worth it
[1:11:51] <%notgarza> Gang tackle: Yoshi
[1:11:52] <cosmicgoatee> ;)
[1:11:52] <$Invlux> ;)
[1:11:53] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> FE Dancer
[1:11:53] <Drusain> She gives Mario her turn
[1:11:54] <toasty_scones> it's busted
[1:11:55] <+zooeymainbtw> rally wink is great
[1:11:56] <%kyh9> the BUFF
[1:11:56] <%Proxzo> Basically give up Goombella's turn to give mario another term
[1:11:57] <%afronooch> ;)
[1:11:57] <alexandrecau> wink for courage
[1:11:58] <%Daniel_Is_I> Rally Wink is pretty much her giving her turn to Mario
[1:11:58] <heartlesshealer> ;)
[1:11:58] <ghoulishcripple> chunky Yoshi
[1:11:59] <Brutalyte616> It gives you an extra move.
[1:12:01] <JetpackMcQuack> GivePLZ turns
[1:12:01] <fritz_dacat> woolieYE Lets go
[1:12:01] <SchwaAkari> Rally Wink is situational in my opinion
[1:12:01] <BlueFusionVolt> It's af4able Kappa
[1:12:02] <%Shwepie> 4 FP to give Goombella's turn to Mario.
[1:12:03] <%sunnythedrunk> ;)
[1:12:03] <%andrex2311> ;)
[1:12:04] <%i_heart_gaming> rally wink plus double item
[1:12:06] <CocoonMoon> ;)
[1:12:08] <+linSP> Dancer goombella
[1:12:08] <GenkoForrest> 1 MORE
[1:12:09] <%kyh9> the healing is EXPENSIVE
[1:12:10] <%Proxzo> Remember Goombella's attack goes up 1
[1:12:10] <%relentingapunch> ;)
[1:12:15] <noe_juan_kanobe> Reequip CP
[1:12:16] <petwisk> and with Double dip you can extra Boost that
[1:12:16] <%xcompleasedad> Wink is God-Tier with this build
[1:12:18] <%GeneralSCPatton> D&D taught us that action economy is king
[1:12:24] <+Lazyjoules> Dont forget you can Respec partners too with Chet
[1:12:29] <glass_marcus> Haste
[1:12:29] <%Papa_Bearman> @Shwepie That's two Star Power uses, potentially, if they need it.
[1:12:29] <SchwaAkari> Bobbery's and Vivian's are the most nuts IMO
[1:12:32] <nxflre> has he tried hold fast yet?
[1:12:35] <%blind_pro> Dont forget that boosting them also increases their attack and HP
[1:12:40] <%paladinstarbuster> charge+wink is godlike
[1:12:41] <%sunnythedrunk> Bomb squad and Koops can also hit all enemies
[1:12:42] <SchwaAkari> Bobbery's is like, 8 damage on everything I think
[1:12:42] <Louie_Salmon> Don't forget that Violence now has 1 more attack, so his basic attack does way more
[1:12:49] <cosmicgoatee> rally wink + boost attack star power + power bounce kolOPWA
[1:12:50] <sparkly_yoyo> I don't think I've ever seen someone strategize so much with this game, and I love it
[1:12:51] <jettsetter> also buffs their damage
[1:12:53] <+linSP> All their other attacks also get stronger
[1:12:53] <thetntm> don't forget boosting adds 1 attack
[1:12:54] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> attack up
[1:12:55] <missingangle> yeah we do
[1:12:57] <Thepothero> Aoes for days
[1:12:57] <%sunnythedrunk> Violence attack boost is more important
[1:12:59] <+TuskAct4> Yeah Bobbery is always my first pick
[1:13:02] <%kyh9> Try it out
[1:13:06] <%Papa_Bearman> Whatever, just one more Sprite and you can get Bob-ombast.
[1:13:07] <JetpackMcQuack> gotta look cool
[1:13:10] <ghoulishcripple> violence got +1 in his attack power. hes a beast

[1:16:17] <sparkly_yoyo> Now here's a man who lives a life of danger
[1:16:18] <%relentingapunch> MY LIFESTYLE
[1:16:19] <jettsetter> DANGER
[1:16:19] <%xcompleasedad> CEASE YOUR TRANSGRESSION
[1:16:21] <Snowfellow> One step away from the Danger Mario run
[1:16:22] <kulmoth> but what is the point
[1:16:22] <+Someone_Kooky> 5 HP
[1:16:22] <%Solidnick18> danger mario PogChamp
[1:16:23] <SoupBowler> It begins
[1:16:24] <+zooeymainbtw> @akuda_bar ?
[1:16:25] <%relentingapunch> DETERMINES MY DEATHSTYLE
[1:16:25] <Brutalyte616> This is where we break the game.
[1:16:25] <%ozmon> That's awesome, that's less HP than you start the game with LUL
[1:16:27] <%chosenjuan42> D A N G E R
[1:16:29] <%Proxzo> Call an Ambulance...BUT NOT FOR ME!
[1:16:31] <time_axis> the only real downside here is that you're wasting coins
[1:16:31] <sexdrugsvideogames> when someone punch you just BOB AND WEAVE
[1:16:34] <cheerfulnpc> I'm not gonna lie, this is baffling.
[1:16:37] <+Slattsquatch> DANGER TIME
[1:16:38] <AstrodropGaming> Decrease HP even more, lets get dangerous!
[1:16:41] <%xcompleasedad> Scenes that led to disaster
[1:16:41] <SirDogBear> How can one person handle this much power?! PogChamp
[1:16:43] <NotHereToStream> akuma run
[1:16:46] <@akuda_bar> @cheerfulnpc modular stats. that's all.
[1:16:47] <+Lazyjoules> I was always too much of a coward to do this
[1:16:48] <emeraldskrull> woolieDATTEBAYO
[1:16:48] <%Th3SmartAlec> @kulmoth the option. if he does this now, he can use badges to change it later
[1:16:54] <CrematedCube> Terrifying freedom
[1:16:55] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:17:00] <+xeros720> yeah, that was my thought, you need to buy the plus badges, but well, whateverr
[1:17:01] <sparkly_yoyo> Gotta be honest, always knew Woolie would become Danger Woolie
[1:17:05] <+Rosen_Thorne> might want to put on timing tutor for the new moves
[1:17:05] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> leave some room for growth
[1:17:08] <$Invlux> Woolie has become the strong
[1:17:10] <%Th3SmartAlec> now...what can you do with your partner?
[1:17:11] <+TrevSmith222> He's slowly turning into Danger Mario.
[1:17:14] <BlackermanZX> this is the true run
[1:17:15] <%chosenjuan42> !Motivated
[1:17:15] <@Moobot> 1492 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[1:17:18] <+xeros720> woolie is always Danger Woolie
[1:17:20] <%Plz_Bro> modular woolie
[1:17:21] <cheerfulnpc> @akuda_bar I guess if it were me I'd prefer a little more HP buffer for when I remove stats via badges
[1:17:21] <Drusain> There is a BP cap eventually fwiw
[1:17:23] <ghoulishcripple> this is like when ippo sealed the Dempsey roll to increase his overall power through limitations
[1:17:25] <%relentingapunch> !MOTIVATED
[1:17:25] <@Moobot> 1493 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[1:17:27] <JetpackMcQuack> cyr5Head numbers dude
[1:17:29] <+Someone_Kooky> !motivated
[1:17:29] <Bootkiller6> Yeah but the cap is like 99 BP
[1:17:30] <scorpionoutcast> ...this is gonna last for 10 battles tops
[1:17:32] <alexandrecau> money and time to be in the same situation
[1:17:35] <kulmoth> inb4 he insta dies
[1:17:35] <+Lazyjoules> Badge based cybernetic body modifications
[1:17:36] <%Papa_Bearman> 78 coins well spent?
[1:17:38] <@akuda_bar> @cheerfulnpc he can just decide to have more or less hp though.
[1:17:39] <thetntm> if you reach the bp cap then you should actually upgrade hp
[1:17:39] <%gatorafan> Warframe Mario
[1:17:41] <SchwaAkari> You need a second HP Plus if this is your build
[1:17:43] <SoupBowler> I would laugh hard if Woolie grinds Power Rush badges off screen after this lmao
[1:17:47] <nicversus> Woolie is a tankie confirmed
[1:17:48] <%xcompleasedad> "Tankier" LUL
[1:17:50] <$Invlux> Hey if we hits the BP cap, we hits it
[1:17:51] <jettsetter> he needs to go full danger build at this point
[1:17:52] <Bootkiller6> Go talk to Lore Rat on the Rooftop
[1:17:53] <%xcompleasedad> Holy FUCK
[1:17:54] <sparkly_yoyo> Check the store, might have Luigi book
[1:17:56] <%TenguGemini> and this is why BP is the god stat

[1:49:30] <+RazgrizStraits> @Th3SmartAlec don't give him attention he'll just keep going
[1:49:33] <%eriksdrums> eriksdrums gifted a Tier 1 sub to sexdrugsvideogames! They have given 27 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[1:49:34] <%chosenjuan42> FIRST ATTACK BADGE?

[1:49:55] <+Th3SmartAlec> @razgrizstraits sorry, misread the room on that one
[1:49:58] <%sexdrugsvideogames> @eriksdrums wow, thanks bro!
[1:50:07] <%eriksdrums> @Th3SmartAlec Already subbed so I can't gift you one, but keep that positivity going
[1:50:13] <%xcompleasedad> @WoolieVersus Do you want to guess recipes, or should we tell you some?
[1:50:13] <+RazgrizStraits> besides, it's woolie. what more u need. i knew he was going to freak out at this game. nothing like some necromancy and divorce in a kids game. also gambling and strippers.
[1:50:18] <%sunnythedrunk> Storage is like 32 items I think
[1:50:43] <sparkly_yoyo> money is a non issue at this point
[1:50:46] <sparkly_yoyo> Woolie bought gold
[1:50:50] <%Lion_kun> A book you read earlier said to combine a mango with a peach.
[1:50:50] <%Th3SmartAlec> @xcompleasedad he doesn't really care about recipes right now
[1:50:52] <+RazgrizStraits> @xcompleasedad apparently say nothing or @dmcRedgrave will have a b* fit
[1:50:54] <samdamgocham> This is truly a one-of-a-kin game

[1:50:58] <%eriksdrums> Was planning on one, but fuck it @pory_z , you participated

[1:51:23] <%pory_z> @eriksdrums wow thanks man !
[1:51:28] <%ozmon> But there's no way the game's gonna tell you 51 recipes, right?
[1:51:32] <%eriksdrums> <3
[1:51:39] <@akuda_bar> these guys are just tricky, you have to learn how they move and then it's easy
[1:51:42] <%sunnythedrunk> LONG LIVE THE KING
[1:51:45] <+williss_> a lot
[1:51:45] <+RazgrizStraits> KEEL MANGO+ Cake Mix is best.
[1:51:46] <%sexdrugsvideogames> @eriksdrums sry for assuming you're a bro btw
[1:51:46] <%chosenjuan42> Most recipies not given must experiment
[1:51:47] <%kyh9> 10 or so
[1:51:48] <%Th3SmartAlec> Jebaited
[1:51:54] <AyyBurden> @woolieversus the quest giver is in the room where you found the sluice crank
[1:51:59] <%kyh9> MIX THAT SYRUP WITH THE MANGO

[1:52:00] <BlackermanZX> Violence commands the tackle gang
[1:52:01] <+RazgrizStraits> or Keel Mango + Turtley Leaf
[1:52:03] <sparkly_yoyo> some recipes are given, others you find by testing
[1:52:05] <%ozmon> 3+2+1+3+2+1+1? 12 I think!
[1:52:09] <%Th3SmartAlec> get em boys
[1:52:13] <+RazgrizStraits> some you will never find.
[1:52:14] <%ozmon> Er 13
[1:52:14] <ghoulishcripple> @woolieversus BTW i saw your Teppen Tweet. gonna come for you at the peak of the mountain!
[1:52:23] <Bootkiller6> Keel Mango has like 5 or 6 recipes it's in, I think
[1:52:24] <+RazgrizStraits> here's a recipe you will never find
[1:52:26] <%eriksdrums> @sexdrugsvideogames I would, in fact, self-identify as a bro
[1:52:29] <Bguy32> unless defense
[1:52:31] <phantomsleeves> @woolieversus you should just look at a guide for recipes when you're ready for them
[1:52:32] <%sexdrugsvideogames> hahaha
[1:52:33] <time_axis> maybe if you charge him
[1:52:37] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> so 1 armor
[1:52:37] <cosmicgoatee> might wanna grab a coconut
[1:52:47] <+Sharmanyx> Woolie is crushing it with the stream numbers!
[1:52:48] <SoupBowler> Using charge or power rushes on VIOLENCE is really good
[1:52:50] <%GeneralSCPatton> @ghoulishcripple You two gonna fight shirtless in the rain on the highest peak of Mount Olympus?
[1:52:54] <abelincoln_catpuncher> ohhh shit we this far???
[1:52:59] <%xcompleasedad> Woolie is figuring it out. SeemsGood
[1:53:03] <sparkly_yoyo> the defense calculation in this game is so simple that it's actually pretty weird
[1:53:04] <benbag13> it doesn't though?
[1:53:05] <ozmon> There issss one caveat with armor. If you get through it on your first hit, you will do at least 1 damage with all your other hits!
[1:53:06] <Thepothero> The violence is almost ultra one might say
[1:53:08] <%bbblaketwitching> it'd definitely reduce by the end

[1:53:29] <+RazgrizStraits> @WoolieVersus there is a recipe you will never find, and it doesn't matter, but there is a roll the dice shoot yourself for power item, called TRIAL STEW. it puts all hp and fp to 1 and maximizes star power.. it looks cool when u use it but yeah
[1:53:29] <abelincoln_catpuncher> LUL LUL
[1:53:30] <SoupBowler> Actually, multihit moves like that still scale with charge. So it would be a charge of + 2 dealing 5,4,3,2,1 and back to 1's

[2:29:54] <%chosenjuan42> woolieONEGUY why!?
[2:29:55] <Bootkiller6> Now we're playing 5D chess boys
[2:29:55] <%LastHazzerd> Woolie wants to find out for himself at least
[2:29:56] <noe_juan_kanobe> ?
[2:29:56] <StarMechV> it aint worth it
[2:30:00] <sparkly_yoyo> not really worth it
[2:30:00] <%Th3SmartAlec> Make another save
[2:30:01] <Rain_Mage> It is because your Obsessed with Violence
[2:30:03] <%Proxzo> Was it after goom goom?
[2:30:05] <SchwaAkari> Let Woolie drive at the speed he wants to drive, chat
[2:30:05] <%sexdrugsvideogames> Woolie is such a perfectionist
[2:30:07] <%RedoctoberWolf> this is the exact reason Pat makes 70 saves
[2:30:08] <%Papa_Bearman> Just play the video on YouTube and dub in commentary?
[2:30:08] <Ner234> SourPls
[2:30:08] <benbag13> no no no no
[2:30:08] <pmmori> it's legit one line
[2:30:10] <%GeneralSCPatton> How much dialogue are we missing? Enough to cram in one dono?
[2:30:10] <noe_juan_kanobe> Whu happening?
[2:30:11] <+dukeofhammer> use a save state
[2:30:12] <%ozmon> Oh yeah, Goomgoom's got stuff to say about every partner, right? Man, this game
[2:30:14] <+AFrostyCookie> ALL that again for what like 2 lines?
[2:30:16] <theCoolChild> Can he even save state?
[2:30:21] <%LastHazzerd> i think he's just looking up a youtube video
[2:30:22] <abelincoln_catpuncher> it's not a big deal
[2:30:24] <%eriksdrums> If this isn't making it to Youtube, feel like answering a few Twitch questions?
[2:30:25] <shiny_prinny> if you saved after the trouble it might be worth it, otherwise idk about that
[2:30:26] <time_axis> now that he knows where he's going and will be skipping all the dialogue, it probably wont be too bad, tbh
[2:30:29] <Darren716> Its super not worth it
[2:30:29] <%kyh9> save state
[2:30:32] <$BallerSwagBro9k> SourPls

[2:30:49] <%SomeSageAdvice> its no prob Woolz lol
[2:30:49] <penitentpentwitch> The Anime has a lot of problems, the Manga can shoulder one or two
[2:30:51] <Bootkiller6> Man I hate when the anime cuts content out of the manga
[2:30:53] <%Chatterbox1991> (Jerma's playing God Hand)

[2:33:33] <%inkthepeasant> Reggie's shirt is great

[2:33:42] <%chosenjuan42> It's ok we can't go back in time
[2:33:43] <Bootkiller6> You miss so much just because each partner has unique dialogue - it's gonna happen all the time

[2:35:54] <%Papa_Bearman> Siesta.
[2:35:55] <%relentingapunch> That fucking lotto is a SCAM
[2:35:56] <%sssoapy> What are you gonna do in the game though
[2:36:01] <+Ether101_Prime> What level of hammer does Woolie have?
[2:36:03] <sparkly_yoyo> some kid actually did it, actually checked daily for 100+ days
[2:36:04] <%chosenjuan42> TOWN BILLBOARD
[2:36:04] <noe_juan_kanobe> Who's worse? Lucky or Podley?
[2:36:10] <time_axis> should have a "save" emote to remind you to save
[2:36:11] <%KyoryUtchy> OH YEAH! Check if roof guy has more lore.
[2:36:19] <%jiggy_snipe> gotta always save in these rpgs

[2:36:35] <benbag13> lore rat
[2:36:44] <sparkly_yoyo> @sexdrugsvideogames quite literally the only way
[2:36:49] <%ozmon> Ooh what about Grifty?

[2:36:56] <%chosenjuan42> behind billboard too
[2:36:56] <%RedoctoberWolf> and back
[2:36:57] <phantomsleeves> he would probably save more if there were multiple slots
[2:36:59] <CrematedCube> Check the backside
[2:37:00] <%GoneWithLaw> READ THE BACK
[2:37:02] <AlexandriasFolly> Did he talk to Luigi yet?

Great FGC content from a black creator. He's tight with Lord Jimmy & Kizzy iirc too! Keep up the great work, I yield my time
[0:10:53] <%tearfuldevil> the last one of those wa suh, kinda lame tbh, proabbly because i don't follow or care about anyone at Rooster Teeth
[0:10:56] <@Solidus_113> go get YOUR stuff
[0:11:03] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> don't strave yourself
[0:11:05] <%Binary_Fireball> @WoolieVersus glad to see you're feeling better Reggie!
[0:11:08] <megamonmon123> lp hungry
[0:11:11] <%sjay449> yeah, the Mica stuff is rough. But I watched the off topic today, they are pretty broken up by it
[0:11:13] <%DesertPenguin> @WoolieVersus Without getting too political, we stand with you. Stay safe
[0:11:14] <heart_ablaze> Fun Fact: the "how to comb your moustache" book is apparently a reference to the YouTuber markiplier. the author is the name of his dad.
[0:11:15] <DelgotHansto> Complete the loadout
[0:11:23] <%sjay449> I'd like Fiona and Woolie to collab
[0:11:25] <$legacy0117> Yepppp it is!!

[0:12:07] <+GarboArbo> Hello hello! I finally made it to the live Doom stream!
[0:12:08] <mar_krow> APATHY IS DEATH
[0:12:11] <%sjay449> Mica left a long time ago because of racist shit RT viewers kept doing, and she was suicidal for a while. RT didn't support her and defend her so she left the company
[0:12:13] <$legacy0117> And yeyeye that Kotor 2 was good times.
[0:12:17] <+JustToWatch> we watched Woolie go through the galaxy brain meme irl
[0:12:24] <%a_goth_pancake> what's going on in the adventures of Fann Y'pakk??
[0:12:26] <brachydios777> Kotor 2 is one of the best Star Wars stories ever made
[0:12:32] <+HostilePoundcakes> Maaaan that shit was internes
[0:12:36] <%dekkitout> I'm trying my best to tear through the KOTOR manga watching Gram gram retain the Exile's chastity

[0:13:03] <%krispen_wa> THE ARROGANCE
[0:13:11] <%sjay449> It's good they aren't letting history repeat itself with Fiona, but I wish what happened with Mica didn't go down
[0:13:17] <Daxalog> Is it? Usually they just say "how was the movie" and I say "it was okay" and thats it
[0:13:17] <%sjay449> Geoff talked about it a lot today
[0:13:20] <arkv01> dawg the best part about star wars is taking that huge piss afterwards

[0:19:46] <%Javaa01> Oh yeah, there's a secret in the room that the Crucible is sitting in now
[0:19:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> WHO ELSE WOULD IT BE
[0:19:51] <+thelonechris> Mars had it coming
[0:19:54] <%DesertPenguin> The UAC is the demon's cuck boy

[0:20:05] <+rytyoung> Mars looks better with a hole in it anyway
[0:20:06] <spidervenomized> you can't shoot a hole into mars
[0:20:06] <%dekkitout> "The Challenged" sounds like a pretty cool name
[0:20:06] <megamonmon123> Fuck mars
[0:20:07] <+GarboArbo> tHEY SHOULD GO TO AUSTRALIA
[0:20:11] <CappuccinoGuil> @rytyoung nooooo I gotta go to sleep, I have a job interview :C
[0:20:11] <%FuqBoiSlim> oh, they're still doing the mortally challenged thing? woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:20:12] <Solidnick18> you blew a fat hole in it
[0:20:14] <heart_ablaze> we pierced mars
[0:20:14] <%sjay449> "You can't blow a hole in Mars" Doom Slayer "haha, gun goes brrrrr"
[0:20:15] <%BisoromiBear> mars is a fuck
[0:20:16] <+blastazoid26> mortally challenged....
[0:20:17] <%DesertPenguin> We welcome our demon saviour
[0:20:19] <Halospaz117> How many problems has Mars caused in this series, fuck that planet
[0:20:21] <+joyoustechnoshrine> EVEN DEMONS KNOW
[0:20:24] <dinnydanny777> We ruined Martian demon culture
[0:20:26] <Ner234> BUT DEMONS THO

[0:20:36] <megamonmon123> secret in the fortress
[0:20:38] <heart_ablaze> haha bfg go bzzzzorp
[0:20:39] <%cobalt_phoenix_> batteries
[0:20:40] <dinnydanny777> I can't believe we destroyed Mars's native demon culture
[0:20:40] <Halospaz117> Not collateral, a bonus
[0:20:41] <DelgotHansto> Mars just got a makeover if anything its a way cooler planet to live on now
[0:20:42] <@Solidus_113> BATTERIES @WoolieVersus
[0:20:43] <+HostilePoundcakes> Hey man those demons gotta go
[0:20:46] <%tearfuldevil> @FuqBoiSlim its odd arcs doing it, sicne they're clearly not working for or udner the uac, and they're fighting agaisnt the demons
[0:20:48] <CappuccinoGuil> Fun fact: the speedrun for this game has you essentially SKIP the whole Mars explosion, so in speedrun lore, Doom Slayer never blew it up LUL
[0:20:51] <BurdRightsActivist> Peepee POO POO'd for the GOOD OF HUMANITY
[0:20:52] <+rytyoung> @delgothansto Woolie ain't accepting refunds for them anyway, he's keeping all that dough
[0:20:56] <%Javaa01> Don't waste em on Full Auto
[0:21:04] <somekindaspy> Woolie, if you want to see your skins, you have to wait for the end of the mission's "game rewards" part.
[0:21:05] <pennykettle_> yea you did a few levels in a row
[0:21:14] <spidervenomized> skins
[0:21:23] <%tearfuldevil> @FuqBoiSlim not sure why Id thinks the joke is so funny, without the context of Holgram Karen saying for it it isn't funny at all
[0:21:32] <%dekkitout> Moar skins tajSMUG
[0:21:40] <resloxxx> B E T H E S D A
[0:21:49] <Halospaz117> It just (doesn't) work
[0:21:57] <spidervenomized> BATHESDA!
[0:21:58] <Solidnick18> oh that's a hard one to find
[0:21:59] <snakest3alth> Use the keys for the Unmaykr
[0:22:02] <thatonepassionbentgamer> ugh i hate that secret
[0:22:04] <+GarboArbo> Don't worry about it
[0:22:07] <Solidnick18> i had to look it up
[0:22:07] <@Solidus_113> there's a secret button
[0:22:07] <+rytyoung> @cappuccinoguil ohh job is more important than watching doom guy kill demons HUH?
[0:22:08] <megamonmon123> look at the window
[0:22:09] <%Javaa01> The red button on one of the roof windows, shoot it
[0:22:10] <%tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus some people (other guys, not me) have suggested that the skins might show up if you let the rewards creen load
[0:22:11] <+GarboArbo> its fine
[0:22:11] <thatonepassionbentgamer> same
[0:22:12] <DelgotHansto> @rytyoung You can get a refund but you have to proof you used the pass less then 10 times
[0:22:17] <pennykettle_> the politically correct demon stuff in this game isnt just unfunny, it kills all world building and beliveability in the game world
[0:22:18] <%cobalt_phoenix_> this one is so out there
[0:22:29] <%FuqBoiSlim> @tearfuldevil yeah, it got a chuckle out of me the first few times but we're halfway through the game and they're still doing it so it lost the luster
[0:22:32] <+rytyoung> @delgothansto I feel like that's a trap LUL
[0:22:32] <pennykettle_> I actually had to google this one
[0:22:33] <heart_ablaze> >( "nooooo you can't just blow a hole in mars" :) "haha mars go boom"
[0:22:34] <TuxedoNash> well, it was a good stream guys
[0:22:35] <+404cp> do they even read this lol?
[0:22:35] <resloxxx> there is no shame for looking up this one
[0:22:37] <megamonmon123> this one is a fun secret
[0:22:40] <Xxstevo69xX > check the little windows next to it
[0:22:41] <RogueMinja> Here's a hint: look for red.
[0:22:44] <somekindaspy> This secret is very difficult to get and requires shooting a specific spot with the sniper attatchment
[0:22:46] <%Javaa01> Look up
[0:22:50] <megamonmon123> look at the windows
[0:22:52] <$Futurecity10> its in this room
[0:22:54] <spidervenomized> there is a secret button
[0:22:54] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:22:54] <Solidnick18> hit look up
[0:22:55] <+404cp> just ballista boost jump up there
[0:22:59] <dinnydanny777> The morally challenged stuff reminds me of Far Cry 5's "politics" which refuses to be political in any way whatsoever
[0:23:00] <Solidnick18> hint*
[0:23:05] <dinnydanny777> mortally*
[0:23:06] <thatonepassionbentgamer> Oh it hurts knowing where it is
[0:23:16] <heart_ablaze> this secret sucks
[0:23:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> there were politics in FC5?
[0:23:18] <Solidnick18> i see it lol
[0:23:23] <+rytyoung> this took me a long time to figure out myself
[0:23:24] <spidervenomized> window that red
[0:23:24] <+eiightbiitt> look up to the right button
[0:23:29] <pennykettle_> This one was so obscure it doesnt even bother me in the slightest that they dont see it
[0:23:32] <+blastazoid26> i saw it
[0:23:32] <megamonmon123> you have to shoot something in that room
[0:23:32] <+SuperKirby24> yea this secret pretty bad lol
[0:23:33] <%Javaa01> Shoot the red thing on the roof window
[0:23:37] <Nohamforsam> RED DOT WINDOW
[0:23:40] <@Solidus_113> there's a secret button to shoot
[0:23:40] <Solidnick18> lol
[0:23:40] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yea I don't blame them on this one
[0:23:40] <thatonepassionbentgamer> aahhhhhhhh
[0:23:43] <%DreyfussFrost> Yeah this secret kind of sucks. The answer is in the same room as the crucible.
[0:23:45] <+eiightbiitt> red window
[0:23:47] <%DesertPenguin> This one was annoying
[0:23:49] <DelgotHansto> @rytyoung Whaaaaa... its just like playtime on a steam game, what you on about?
[0:23:51] <somekindaspy> there is a red target on the window, shoot it with the sniper
[0:23:52] <raikagelord1> One of these is not like the other
[0:23:52] <spidervenomized> shoot
[0:23:52] <heart_ablaze> reggie my man

[0:25:58] <Ultimatefool> Punch that switch Woolie
[0:26:00] <resloxxx> all that people looking for the secret regarding the amulet in original dark souls LUL
[0:26:12] <Solidnick18> yes
[0:26:19] <%DesertPenguin> Only in DS2
[0:26:20] <+Promessa_EX> let['s imagine pat raided woolie
[0:26:21] <heartlesshealer> The Black Mesa crates
[0:26:21] <%tearfuldevil> @dinnydanny777 they've been doing the whole "maybe the villain has a point" thing since 3 actually
[0:26:31] <%DesertPenguin> DS2 was the only one that they break
[0:26:33] <+jiggy_snipe> chain
[0:26:37] <%DesertPenguin> Always use the chain
[0:26:40] <+DukeBlack_> Even had you spooked in Bloodborne
[0:26:41] <+Data_Base00> Data_Base00 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:26:48] <+rytyoung> Smelly mimic breath
[0:26:50] <OrangeMDT> dont the chests just look different?
[0:26:54] <pennykettle_> Bloodborne had hidden walls but like, only in chalice dungeons
[0:27:00] <@Solidus_113> Q3 INTRO PogChamp
[0:27:04] <%DreyfussFrost> Ugh, I hate that the mimics in DS1 have different chains. It's such a cop-out. Mimics breathe. It's so much harder to spot and WAY more immersive.
[0:27:08] <spidervenomized> the mimics was only a problem for ds1 not d3
[0:27:10] <+GarboArbo> This is a good track
[0:27:10] <Calek> @OrangeMDT only thing that's different is the chain is in a different position
[0:27:11] <%DesertPenguin> Get a new skin LUL
[0:27:19] <%FuqBoiSlim> hat
[0:27:20] <+jiggy_snipe> needs more mimic bs
[0:27:23] <dinnydanny777> @tearfuldevil Oh I know, it was interesting in 3 and in 4, but in 5 it makes zero sense at all
[0:27:25] <DelgotHansto> @pennykettle_ Would you count the passage to Ebrietas?
[0:27:25] <%DesertPenguin> Would it better to know that they exist or exactly how many?
[0:27:29] <mrslappyboi2020> Hey Woolie!
[0:27:40] <heartlesshealer> It's cool until you do it
[0:27:45] <%FuqBoiSlim> I'm still butthurt how the first chest you find in DS3 is a fucking mimic
[0:27:49] <heart_ablaze> WOooLei GeT thE SkIns!!!!
[0:27:51] <%a_goth_pancake> join Slayer club and get zombie skin, I need it for reasons woolieMIRIN
[0:27:54] <lilredmage> woolieMIRIN
[0:27:59] <resloxxx> Mimics should grab you when you get too close TBH
[0:28:00] <somekindaspy> nah dont get the skins. let's just go
[0:28:01] <%tearfuldevil> @dinnydanny777 tbh i kind fo wish they did a DLC campaign for FC4's "secret ending"
[0:28:07] <Mrthefro> Wait on a cloud for 2 hours LUL
[0:28:12] <pennykettle_> DelgotHansto mmm maybe. Technically it totally is but feels like it isn't because it isn't a magic wall, its a breakable window
[0:28:16] <snakest3alth> Use the Empyrean Keys, Woolie
[0:28:24] <%laserbeaming> I like DS1's secret walls because of the player messages
[0:28:26] <megamonmon123> we will remind him on the last time
[0:28:26] <Vohs_Bru> Good old Q3 Arena music
[0:28:28] <somekindaspy> Oh yeah, don't forget to use the keys after this mission
[0:28:30] <dinnydanny777> DS2's chests were the worst, I remember some of them were in boss rooms and could just break in a boss fight
[0:28:31] <megamonmon123> the game will tell him
[0:28:33] <%a_goth_pancake> keys forgotten

[0:30:52] <%Javaa01> This is running on the latest patch
[0:30:55] <%lewdskeletor13> Tear ass nah bad
[0:31:07] <somekindaspy> That image
[0:31:10] <Visorak6> Its the planety
[0:31:14] <%Javaa01> And PS4 got the first patch
[0:31:14] <somekindaspy> Argent D'nur is the name of the Planet
[0:31:15] <%vaderxyz1970> Realm
[0:31:15] <Tucker0603> nope, the realm
[0:31:15] <%lewdskeletor13> breebuPog
[0:31:16] <%DesertPenguin> @solidus_113 I believe PS4 has patches
[0:31:17] <%DreyfussFrost> It's the planet I think.
[0:31:19] <Ultimatefool> It's the realm
[0:31:27] <somekindaspy> D'nur is the planet
[0:31:27] <%lewdskeletor13> The realm
[0:31:30] <somekindaspy> Don't forget that image!
[0:31:32] <%tearfuldevil> @lewdskeletor13 nah, my ass is pretty bad Kappa
[0:31:38] <VJdarkworld> iirc, some companies do "online" patches. meaning u need to be online with the brand account to get patches
[0:31:39] <Solidnick18> good job
[0:31:39] <%vaderxyz1970> Mortal Kombat Ream like
[0:31:48] <%vaderxyz1970> Realm
[0:31:49] <%lewdskeletor13> I must consult the elder gods
[0:31:49] <+rytyoung> Argent D'nur World, the happiest place in the world
[0:31:50] <%a_goth_pancake> BAT-TER-Y
[0:31:50] <%SirGO0SE> Lord of the Realm
[0:31:51] <DatAsuna> Lowkey I hate naming things
[0:31:53] <Solidnick18> yeah like mortal kombat
[0:31:55] <dinnydanny777> How about a "Dominion"
[0:31:56] <Solidnick18> shao khan
[0:31:57] <spidervenomized> earthrealm
[0:31:58] <Monkeyweed21> Argent D'nur was a multi planet empire
[0:32:02] <thatonepassionbentgamer> HE MISSSED
[0:32:04] <megamonmon123> oh Im rememebering some stuff
[0:32:05] <+greenfall> teras nabad is ok but my least favorite lvl
[0:32:08] <megamonmon123> about this level
[0:32:09] <%Chatterbox1991> You want a Reich, Woolie? (Reich is German for Realm)
[0:32:09] <somekindaspy> Sentinel Prime is the capital city. Argenta is the people. D'nur is the home planet
[0:32:11] <megamonmon123> hahahaha
[0:32:11] <@Solidus_113> max arbalest
[0:32:14] <pennykettle_> If Argent D'nur is the realm/planet, how was part of it sucked into Hell
[0:32:18] <%Livelinne> Danube flashback
[0:32:20] <%Javaa01> Get Arbalest
[0:32:20] <DatAsuna> I've been writing this game forever and I keep swapping out the names cause I hate them.
[0:32:20] <$realm_forge> I agree with woolz realms r best
[0:32:21] <%lewdskeletor13> The challenges are hard on this one
[0:32:22] <+SuperKirby24> o shit this is where those positional glory kill challenges start huh Kappa
[0:32:23] <DelgotHansto> It is known that there is only one true ruler of outworld
[0:32:24] <Tucker0603> SHIELD BOYS
[0:32:24] <pennykettle_> or like isnt half the planet in hell?
[0:32:25] <%tearfuldevil> @pennykettle_ magic, duh
[0:32:27] <%Javaa01> You WILL need Arbalest
[0:32:30] <somekindaspy> @pennykettle_ They were at war with hell for a while, dude
[0:32:35] <somekindaspy> Hell is known to eat worlds
[0:32:41] <peachy996> Onaga, The Dragon King
[0:32:53] <DelgotHansto> @peachy996 AYYYY someone gets it
[0:32:57] <%FuqBoiSlim> So hell is like the darkness from kingdom hearts?
[0:32:59] <Solidnick18> heat blast at max is amazing
[0:33:00] <+rytyoung> Heat blast is so stronk
[0:33:02] <peachy996> Love that intro dude
[0:33:06] <+GarboArbo> Arbalest is good
[0:33:08] <@Solidus_113> you will
[0:33:11] <spidervenomized> only argent d'nur is in hell not sential prime of taras nabal
[0:33:11] <%cobalt_phoenix_> but you should tho
[0:33:14] <thatonepassionbentgamer> Arbalest is godlhy
[0:33:15] <DelgotHansto> Fuckin sick shit
[0:33:16] <%DreyfussFrost> Arbalest is fantastic for Cacos and Pain Elementals.
[0:33:16] <Solidnick18> ehhhh
[0:33:16] <@Solidus_113> you haven't been using the blade either
[0:33:17] <dinnydanny777> Doomslayer's power is friendship
[0:33:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it's seige mode
[0:33:18] <somekindaspy> Hell is Hell. You don't go to hell if you're a bad person, you go there if they drag you there
[0:33:18] <%Javaa01> Arbalest one shots cacodemons and two shots pain elementals
[0:33:19] <RogueMinja> Arbalest is super good.
[0:33:23] <+paladinstarbuster> you havent been using the balde tho
[0:33:25] <%Javaa01> It hard counters flying enemies
[0:33:26] <%a_goth_pancake> it's not gauss...
[0:33:40] <somekindaspy> He's used the destroyer blade before in previous parts. Arbalest is for flying boys.
[0:33:42] <Tucker0603> arbalest is great for flyers, but I do love shield though
[0:33:44] <thatonepassionbentgamer> it kicks like the gauss in the air tho
[0:33:45] <somekindaspy> Destroyer blade is a giant fuck you
[0:33:47] <%a_goth_pancake> siege mode RIP :(
[0:33:51] <megamonmon123> he'll be fine either way
[0:34:11] <Solidnick18> eh don't worry about to much
[0:34:11] <%lewdskeletor13> I would not be surprised if this level is the whole session
[0:34:11] <somekindaspy> @a_goth_pancake Destroyer Blade is the new siege mode, just horizontal
[0:34:16] <DelgotHansto> They're both too good I'm always hotswapping ballista mods
[0:34:18] <spidervenomized> was to good to be nerf
[0:34:33] <%Javaa01> You can very much live without Mobile Turret
[0:34:34] <+paladinstarbuster> but then you have a shield
[0:34:38] <%Javaa01> Since spinup is instant
[0:34:40] <%Javaa01> Unlike 2016
[0:34:45] <peachy996> Take your time Woolie, this is a nice breather level
[0:34:45] <koolaid_kevster> STAR PRLATNIUM
[0:34:46] <%a_goth_pancake> yeah but the charge shot is so difficult to get off
[0:34:51] <dinnydanny777> The shield mode means you can't be shot but you can in fact shoot
[0:34:51] <DelgotHansto> Why not both?
[0:34:53] <RunningNGunning> hahaha machine gun go brrrrrrrrr
[0:35:03] <somekindaspy> you can shoot while your shield is up
[0:35:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> the blade never seemed useful, the charge up plus immobility, plus the fact that it didn't seem to do as much as i expected, makes the blade useless to me
[0:35:10] <%lewdskeletor13> You can’t just shoot a hole in mars
[0:35:10] <dinnydanny777> You can shoot enemies but they can't shoot you with the shield mode
[0:35:11] <+GarboArbo> Siege is super fun
[0:35:18] <%nawji> Full auto shotgun is even juicier than SSG imo
[0:35:24] <somekindaspy> @CobaltPhoenix27 you can behead hell knights and dread knights instantly with it
[0:35:32] <somekindaspy> headshots are key in any fps
[0:35:33] <thatonepassionbentgamer> Rude awakening incoming in......
[0:35:36] <+rytyoung> Shield mod is super useful in higher difficulties
[0:35:36] <%Javaa01> Blade is pretty trash, the mastery makes it usable, but it's still way worse then Arbalest
[0:36:01] <megamonmon123> hes on hurt me plenty so no upgrade is a bad one
[0:36:06] <@Solidus_113> it hard counters anything that flies
[0:36:07] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @somekindaspy oh I never realized that. does it have to be full charge or partial charge?
[0:36:12] <somekindaspy> full
[0:36:18] <Robot_Nixon_> calebKek

[0:39:08] <somekindaspy> ROCKETLAUNCHER, SHOOT HIS FEET
[0:39:11] <DatAsuna> The answer is to not shoot his shield so much
[0:39:12] <spidervenomized> DON'T SHOOT THE SHEILD
[0:39:16] <%lewdskeletor13> wooliePOYO wooliePOYO wooliePOYO wooliePOYO

[0:39:36] <umbrellaswereawesome> Does Woolie remember that the doggy can be killed?
[0:39:37] <Solidnick18> they have a challenge with this guy and it sucks
[0:39:37] <%a_goth_pancake> no shield
[0:39:41] <%DesertPenguin> This is rough
[0:39:41] <peachy996> This is the when levels say "git gud Doomguy"
[0:39:44] <%nawji> the mans can't aim, if you aren't able to put up with it after watching Black Mesa I don't know what to say
[0:39:44] <%BallerSwagBro9k> MARAUDED WITH NO BRIM
[0:39:45] <+MajiOMNI> stop shooting the shield
[0:39:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> shield is fed
[0:39:46] <thatonepassionbentgamer> i didnt know you could glory the dog
[0:39:47] <Calek> the trick is for him to wait for him to attack you with the big opening, and then you BFG his face
[0:39:47] <+YabbaTroll> dog is fed
[0:39:48] <%DesertPenguin> That was a qucik extra life
[0:39:48] <%lewdskeletor13> When you stagger him you have enough time to get two shots in
[0:39:48] <%a_goth_pancake> shield = FrankerZ
[0:39:48] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:39:49] <brachydios777> Time for a good time
[0:39:49] <+mckraven> He's a rough fight every time he shows up for sure
[0:39:50] <somekindaspy> If you shoot his shield, he summons his dog
[0:39:53] <megamonmon123> oh boy
[0:39:53] <BlackermanZX> Damn gg LUL
[0:39:54] <Solidnick18> marauder going in hard

[0:40:08] <%DesertPenguin> Rocket Launder
[0:40:09] <+HostilePoundcakes> ULTRA COMBOO
[0:40:09] <%DreyfussFrost> He knows not the shoot the shield, what he might not know is that the shield comes out in 0 frames unless the Marauder is in axe recovery.

[0:40:20] <DatAsuna> just bloodborne it, counter only
[0:40:20] <thatonepassionbentgamer> damn
[0:40:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> JUST USE SUPER SHOTGUN
[0:40:21] <peachy996> Welcome to Taras Nabad
[0:40:21] <heart_ablaze> you can bfg him if you time it right
[0:40:22] <%Javaa01> Now do it clean
[0:40:23] <KinduVborrd> Does anyone here know what song is used in the intro of the LP?
[0:40:23] <DatAsuna> you'll be fine
[0:40:25] <BlackermanZX> use Super Shotgun and Balista
[0:40:25] <Solidnick18> Only when it flashes green
[0:40:25] <@Solidus_113> counter hits
[0:40:26] <%a_goth_pancake> *g
[0:40:26] <RichochetForce> @CobaltPhoenix27 CHAOS REIGNS
[0:40:28] <%lewdskeletor13> Super shotgun is your friend
[0:40:28] <megamonmon123> so super shotgun and ballista
[0:40:29] <@Solidus_113> footsies
[0:40:31] <%Javaa01> Read the tip
[0:40:31] <+green715> After you stagger him with green eyes, use a frag too
[0:40:34] <BurdRightsActivist> Stay at Mid Range
[0:40:36] <+segmentedfool> If you have great timing you can land a bfg
[0:40:36] <%DesertPenguin> Shoot it to kill it
[0:40:36] <+Nickmobox> Super shotgun is best for him with green eyes
[0:40:38] <nicb0berg> Has WoolieVersus ever played xenoblade chronicles ?
[0:40:39] <Ozmodyas> super shotgun and ballista fastswap
[0:40:41] <+GarboArbo> FALSE IDOL CONFIRMED
[0:40:42] <%tearfuldevil> @DreyfussFrost he knew, last session but he's ebena ctivley shotting the shield this whole fight, so........
[0:40:42] <%DesertPenguin> BFG doesn't work
[0:40:43] <%TheOneUpWarrior> super shotty and ballista bodies these guys
[0:40:43] <dinnydanny777> Use anything which is single shot high damage
[0:40:45] <VJdarkworld> super shotgun and ballista
[0:40:48] <+MajiOMNI> you can remote detonate rockets behind him too
[0:40:48] <kei_ar_> you can punch but no stun. just use the super shotgun or RUN in a circle shooting bombs where he will go
[0:40:49] <%a_goth_pancake> you can get two blasts in if you're quick enough
[0:40:49] <megamonmon123> woolie false idol
[0:40:50] <FeelinNifty> I didn't see Woolie fight the marauder before. Does he know about / is he willing to use the cheese?
[0:40:52] <umbrellaswereawesome> Remember when you beat him last time, Woolz!
[0:40:54] <whazat> super shotgun and quick swap to the ballista, if you can hit him with a frag it can extend the falter but it's hard
[0:40:55] <%mitchteck> Super shotgun+ balista
[0:40:57] <kei_ar_> LEAD with bombs and lame it out
[0:41:01] <raikagelord1> Those two quickswap
[0:41:02] <+HostilePoundcakes> This guy really makes players get good to be honest
[0:41:02] <%nawji> ballista, shotgun, rocket launcher. stay at midrange, shoot when green
[0:41:04] <%DesertPenguin> How many extra lives is he gonna go through? Taking bets now
[0:41:06] <%nawji> if he 's not green don't shoot
[0:41:07] <FrostedZaibatsu> AOE damage works on them
[0:41:07] <HelghastTroop> i like how people try to defend this as good enemy, but they are always wrong
[0:41:08] <DelgotHansto> BFG works as a distraction for one free hit so its really not worth it
[0:41:10] <whazat> don't forget to chainsaw if you run out of SSG
[0:41:16] <Ozmodyas> He already went through the lives he had
[0:41:18] <RichochetForce> @megamonmon123 Reggie is a usurper. True story. My enemies have been opened.
[0:41:24] <somekindaspy> lmao
[0:41:28] <%a_goth_pancake> keep your eyes on the rauder.
[0:41:31] <+rytyoung> I killed a Maurader once with a bfg shot but could never replicate it as I shot it behind him and he wasn't able to block it
[0:41:36] <VJdarkworld> (rocket launcher with remote detonate breaks the fight LOL) but super shot gun and ballista combo be the intended way
[0:41:39] <%DesertPenguin> When you hit him he gets staggered. Use that time to quick switch to the shotgun
[0:41:40] <%SirGO0SE> SourPls
[0:41:44] <somekindaspy> what @VJdarkworld said
[0:41:47] <%lewdskeletor13> @helghasttroop It is good though, just gotta learn the timing
[0:41:48] <Solidnick18> SourPls open up this pit
[0:41:52] <spidervenomized> @DelgotHansto two BFG can kill him
[0:41:53] <%a_goth_pancake> when rauder isn't on screen, people should be asking; "where's rauder?"
[0:42:03] <%Javaa01> Nope, he can cancel out of the run
[0:42:05] <RichochetForce> @VJdarkworld Yup, you can abuse the remote detonate's explosion (especially the upgraded one) + grenades and he just falls over like a baby
[0:42:08] <%DesertPenguin> Shoot dog first
[0:42:08] <peachy996> Woolie WILL learn to deal with Marauders tonight
[0:42:10] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus The weapon mod doesn't change regular fire. basic Ballista shot does the damage
[0:42:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @a_goth_pancake LUL
[0:42:11] <somekindaspy> here's a fun tip, if you shoot a grenade over his head, he gets distracted by it
[0:42:12] <%Javaa01> He can even run up shotgun
[0:42:12] <peachy996> He has no choice
[0:42:13] <%DesertPenguin> When you see the dog you must defat it
[0:42:13] <+rytyoung> @a_goth_pancake or wens MahRauder
[0:42:18] <Solidnick18> that's gonna happen ALOT
[0:42:19] <%SuperKirby24> Kappa
[0:42:21] <thatonepassionbentgamer> eeesh
[0:42:21] <%Javaa01> So don't sleep on movement
[0:42:22] <+TheBigTaco> you'll learn boy
[0:42:24] <megamonmon123> splash damage works as well woolie
[0:42:24] <%lewdskeletor13> Yeah by the end you WILL learn the timing
[0:42:30] <+TenguGemini> the marauder would be so much easier without the dog
[0:42:32] <BlackermanZX> never use the chaingun vs marauder
[0:42:33] <Ozmodyas> Snuff that Pupper for a Shinespark
[0:42:36] <megamonmon123> maurader is weak to splash damage as well
[0:42:39] <+GarboArbo> You must learn
[0:42:40] <+murilo182x> The dog dies in one ice grenade
[0:42:40] <%lewdskeletor13> Look around for the fodder demons
[0:42:42] <@Solidus_113> trash mobs will infinitely spawn to give you more ammo @WoolieVersus
[0:42:44] <heart_ablaze> never stop moving
[0:42:45] <+404cp> the dog is your punishment for shooting his sheild
[0:42:46] <UvBenServed> Always shoot dog, never shoot shield
[0:42:47] <%nawji> it isn't that hard to fight the arbalest without the dog
[0:42:48] <+404cp> he doesnt summon it
[0:42:50] <raikagelord1> The learning begins
[0:42:50] <RunningNGunning> Keeping the mobs alive so you can chainsaw them for ammo would be helpful
[0:42:52] <somekindaspy> If you shoot his shield, he summons his dog
[0:42:52] <+404cp> if you get your timing down
[0:42:52] <+rytyoung> Keeping distance from him is fine, he will come to you
[0:42:52] <megamonmon123> grenades and rocket splash damage works but behind the shield
[0:42:52] <%nawji> the marauder I mean lmao
[0:43:00] <HelghastTroop> @lewdskeletor13 its not that hes too difficult to learn, is just this is bad fight because it drags the pacing of the game way the fuck down
[0:43:01] <%Javaa01> Don't fuck up and you don't have to worry about the dog
[0:43:01] <peachy996> Marauder is weak to mean insults
[0:43:03] <BlackermanZX> using the chaingun will just summon the dog
[0:43:03] <%DreyfussFrost> Chaingun is good for dog because you don't have to be perfectly accurate. Dog doesn't have much health.
[0:43:03] <+WutangchickeN> precision shots or aoe for dogg
[0:43:04] <%a_goth_pancake> rauder is weak to Ah Ha!
[0:43:05] <RichochetForce> Dog always runs WIDE to the side of the side it's headed
[0:43:06] <whazat> Hot-swapping to the Ballista after firing an SSG shot will be faster than reloading the SSG, allowing you to hit him twice (or a third if you swap back)
[0:43:07] <heart_ablaze> use mini missiles on doggo
[0:43:08] <%SuperKirby24> gifg: episode marauder begins Kappa
[0:43:11] <umbrellaswereawesome> It's always funny watching someone still learning how to fight a Marauder, and then watching someone like Zero Master or SmvR melt one in 10 seconds.
[0:43:11] <somekindaspy> Someone tell him that he gets super distracted by grenades
[0:43:12] <Solidnick18> you cannot pet that dog
[0:43:13] <megamonmon123> yeah thats a good plan woolie
[0:43:28] <megamonmon123> yeah frag grenades helo
[0:43:35] <%Javaa01> You can get health from chainsaws at low health
[0:43:36] <%lewdskeletor13> @helghasttroop Really doesn’t. Once you know the pattern it takes like 25 seconds
[0:43:39] <raikagelord1> Quick swap between Shotgun and Ballista
[0:43:43] <peachy996> I'm kinda bummed Taras Nabad shares the same theme as Exultia
[0:43:44] <RunningNGunning> Suddenly Doom has become an Resident Evil resource manager
[0:43:44] <%a_goth_pancake> don't bust that bork; try to avoid shooting that shield so he doesn't summon
[0:43:45] <%Javaa01> All kills at low health give you health drops
[0:43:49] <%BearSawed> Yeah fuk melee, damn space space animals
[0:43:51] <%Javaa01> Regardless of how you kill them
[0:43:52] <DelgotHansto> Best way to deal with the dog is never letting the dog appear
[0:43:54] <BlackermanZX> you only need the shotgun and or the ballista
[0:44:01] <peachy996> Meathook is still a great track though
[0:44:01] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:44:06] <%a_goth_pancake> gfd Mick outdid himself with this ost.
[0:44:09] <RunningNGunning> SourPls
[0:44:13] <%lewdskeletor13> Fodder Demons will infinitely spawn, you can find them
[0:44:23] <raikagelord1> Shot shotty and the immediately switch to Ballista
[0:44:30] <raikagelord1> That is the loop
[0:44:48] <Solidnick18> work those fingers
[0:44:53] <+GarboArbo> ideed
[0:44:55] <%JustYudha> this one is tough
[0:44:58] <+GarboArbo> indeed
[0:44:59] <+rytyoung> It's nice to have a demon that is such an overwhelming threat than everything else, like the snake ladies are just as aggressive but nothing compared to the Mahrauder
[0:45:03] <HelghastTroop> do think this guy looks rad as shit tho
[0:45:03] <Robot_Nixon_> theyre manageable on PC, since you can bind each weapon to a key
[0:45:13] <HelghastTroop> creature design rules in this game
[0:45:18] <somekindaspy> agreed
[0:45:18] <peachy996> Smash in FPS right here
[0:45:24] <heart_ablaze> cam u chainsaw the dog???
[0:45:24] <BurdRightsActivist> You got him in a good ryhtm
[0:45:24] <RichochetForce> @HelghastTroop He's actually really fair.
[0:45:25] <+HostilePoundcakes> That was better run
[0:45:30] <raikagelord1> Better
[0:45:33] <somekindaspy> @WoolieVersus if you aim a grenade over his head, he will focus down hard on it. it's a cheese tactic
[0:45:35] <Solidnick18> you can shoot the dog
[0:45:35] <+murilo182x> You can quickswap on console as well, but it's a little too advanced, he needs to learn the basics first
[0:45:36] <heart_ablaze> *can
[0:45:37] <+rytyoung> @heart_ablaze nope
[0:45:40] <BlackermanZX> Woolie learning the footsies
[0:45:41] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus You can, go to the weapon tab in the pause menu and change the weapon wheel layout
[0:45:43] <brachydios777> Fodder spawns in the back
[0:45:45] <DonsCountryStore> Woolie/Reggie, the penalty for shooting the shield is his dog appearing
[0:45:46] <RunningNGunning> Is there a switch back to last used weapon button on console?
[0:45:47] <%lewdskeletor13> Woolie or Reggie, there are infinite fodder demons at the other end of the bridge
[0:45:49] <+WutangchickeN> You can do it Woolie we believe in you.
[0:45:56] <Make_me_mad> I really think the marauder's are annoying because they demand so much attention. It makes me not enjoy other combat encounters because I'm wondering if one of them is going to show up.
[0:45:59] <megamonmon123> frag grenades
[0:46:02] <raikagelord1> @murilo182x ahhh didn’t know
[0:46:02] <+greenfall> you can remove wepon auto switch
[0:46:05] <whazat> running out of ammo is quite an issue if you spam shots. don't take more than one shot if the first one misses because the second one is likely to be blocked
[0:46:05] <%DesertPenguin> @runningNGunning yes
[0:46:08] <Solidnick18> all about spacing
[0:46:09] <somekindaspy> hahaha just wait until the archvile
[0:46:12] <RichochetForce> @Make_me_mad They're so easy to kill, though.
[0:46:14] <%a_goth_pancake> ngl, this fight took me like fifteen attempts on UV. Actually. just keep your eye on him and watch his patterns, you got this woolz
[0:46:14] <heart_ablaze> after finding out you can chainsaw the tentacle, I don't know anymore...
[0:46:15] <%BearSawed> Point at man push button hard
[0:46:19] <DonsCountryStore> Don't shoot his shield=no bad doggo
[0:46:19] <peachy996> I hated the Marauder at first but then I came around
[0:46:20] <%DesertPenguin> Triangle or Y is switch to last weapon
[0:46:22] <brachydios777> You literally have to get good
[0:46:29] <THELava_lad> Don't shoot the sheild
[0:46:31] <%DesertPenguin> There ya go
[0:46:31] <+rytyoung> @solidnick18 yeah the game kinda lies about keeping close to counter him
[0:46:32] <RunningNGunning> Hes learning PogChamp
[0:46:34] <%a_goth_pancake> yeyeye
[0:46:36] <peachy996> Those are the good chunks
[0:46:36] <spidervenomized> much better
[0:46:37] <@Solidus_113> EZ
[0:46:39] <somekindaspy> you got this, woolz!
[0:46:40] <%Asuterisuku> Hey, remember that boss? Now it's a regular enemy. I love when games do that.
[0:46:44] <%a_goth_pancake> woolieGLORY woolieGLORY woolieGLORY woolieGLORY woolieGLORY woolieGLORY
[0:46:49] <%DesertPenguin> So close
[0:46:49] <negrosnake9185> Chainsaw the fodder for ammo

[0:47:01] <%eyezehuhh> woolieGLORY woolieGLORY woolieGLORY woolieGLORY
[0:47:02] <BlackermanZX> so close
[0:47:02] <%DesertPenguin> Nooooooooooo
[0:47:04] <RunningNGunning> Good try
[0:47:05] <Solidnick18> FUCK DOG
[0:47:05] <+paladinstarbuster> @WoolieVersus youre just rusty you beat him in two tries before. U CAN DO IT
[0:47:06] <BlackermanZX> you only need AMMO
[0:47:07] <+HostilePoundcakes> F
[0:47:08] <%SuperKirby24> damn
[0:47:08] <Solidnick18> lol
[0:47:09] <DelgotHansto> Precison Shot works
[0:47:09] <%lewdskeletor13> I hated the Marauder at first, but there’s a challenge that literally forces you to get the timing down, and they’re easy peasy now
[0:47:09] <+segmentedfool> Actually so close
[0:47:09] <spidervenomized> only shoot him when he flashes green
[0:47:12] <VJdarkworld> TACTICAL RETREAT
[0:47:13] <DonsCountryStore> shooting the shield generates the doggo
[0:47:13] <%cobalt_phoenix_> more fodder by the gate
[0:47:14] <%DesertPenguin> You just need to keep a few fodder around for ammo
[0:47:16] <+GarboArbo> The game tells you NOT to get close though
[0:47:16] <%a_goth_pancake> BUST BORK
[0:47:17] <DatAsuna> he also changes his moves by range
[0:47:19] <+segmentedfool> Go find an enemy to chainsaw
[0:47:19] <megamonmon123> bullets are bad
[0:47:20] <whazat> Don't waste too many shots! Leave enemies alive to chainsaw, just kite them!
[0:47:21] <heart_ablaze> DAMN YOU STAND DOGGO
[0:47:21] <Make_me_mad> It's not that they're super hard, it's just that they're so persistently on your ass that it takes the fun out of dealing with the rest of the enemies. I wanna fight a Tyrant and jump around firing rockets, not just counter-shotgun this one axe dude.
[0:47:21] <@Solidus_113> trash mobs will infinitely spawn to give you more ammo @WoolieVersus
[0:47:22] <BlackermanZX> You did so well you only need ammo
[0:47:25] <somekindaspy> if you're gonna use any explosives, just maintain your distance
[0:47:27] <%lewdskeletor13> Fodder demons at the end of the bridge
[0:47:29] <+murilo182x> Use the SSG and Ballista for now
[0:47:31] <+segmentedfool> shit mobs infinitely spawn
[0:47:31] <Solidnick18> just be aware of that
[0:47:32] <megamonmon123> remembee that trash mobs are ammo
[0:47:33] <+Nickmobox> Trash mobs spawn past the doors infinitely
[0:47:34] <DelgotHansto> Switch to Sniper Shot for another viable damage option
[0:47:38] <%lewdskeletor13> Running away is a valid tactic
[0:47:42] <%BearSawed> Im pretty sure he knows about the dog bois hes just not doing it
[0:47:44] <%DesertPenguin> Always keep a random fodder demon around. Just fight away from them so they don't interfere
[0:47:47] <%DesertPenguin> Go forward
[0:47:47] <+greenfall> use the entire stage
[0:47:48] <DatAsuna> It says keep him mid range for good reason
[0:47:53] <%DesertPenguin> NONE SHALL PASS
[0:47:56] <RichochetForce> @Make_me_mad But again, that's not bad. Marauders evaporate once you know how to kill them. There's several strategies. It'd only be bad if there were TONS of enemies like him in the game.
[0:47:59] <brachydios777> Fodder by the door respawns
[0:48:02] <%lewdskeletor13> Thank you Reggie
[0:48:06] <%a_goth_pancake> try retreating up the bridge to grab ammo and health from fodder and parkour over him when he gets close to you
[0:48:07] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:48:08] <somekindaspy> fodder typically infinitely spawn
[0:48:08] <%DesertPenguin> Nice try
[0:48:08] <DFireCreations> there should always be fodder demons around, I dont think they ever disappear from an encounter
[0:48:10] <WanderingSwordsman> @woolieversus use the remote detonate and frags to dmg him behind his shield
[0:48:10] <BurdRightsActivist> GET FUCKED
[0:48:17] <DelgotHansto> You start with 3 pips of chainsaw
[0:48:17] <%DesertPenguin> Fodder will infinitely respawn for ammo
[0:48:17] <%lewdskeletor13> Fodder demons spawn infinitely in that room
[0:48:19] <heart_ablaze> woolie has become the new pat
[0:48:24] <Dingo_Eejit> Balls Explosings - LIVE ON STREAM
[0:48:32] <whazat> the bridge over river shit
[0:48:33] <+doc_ock_rokc> @WoolieVersus kite him to one end of the bridge then get fodder
[0:48:36] <Solidnick18> you can bfg the bridge but you gotta be far a way enough that he doesn't see you.
[0:48:37] <megamonmon123> what woolie was doing was fine
[0:48:40] <raikagelord1> I mean the marauder is super hard.
[0:48:42] <AncyentMarinere> Door bad
[0:48:47] <Make_me_mad> @RichochetForce True. But until you know where he's gonna appear, to me at least, it kinda takes the fun out of other combat encounters because you don't know if one of them is going to show up and steal the spotlight.
[0:48:50] <%lewdskeletor13> Woolie ignoring Reggies good advice
[0:48:51] <+JD0394> Cmon man use common sense. Don’t try going in until you thin out the enemies
[0:49:04] <RunningNGunning> yeyeyeyeye

[0:49:14] <%a_goth_pancake> Perfect
[0:49:15] <Solidnick18> SourPls
[0:49:16] <spidervenomized> only shoot him when he flashes green or he will block and summon doggo
[0:49:18] <RunningNGunning> You should be good on ammo now
[0:49:22] <Solidnick18> get in that ass
[0:49:22] <%a_goth_pancake> PER.FECT.
[0:49:23] <@Solidus_113> remember to switch grenade types too
[0:49:24] <spidervenomized> also use freg
[0:49:27] <%Asuterisuku> Marauder feels out of sync with the rest of the gameplay but really he just makes you pay attention.
[0:49:27] <+JD0394> Marauder is great. Reminds me of a dark souls invasion
[0:49:28] <spidervenomized> frag
[0:49:28] <RichochetForce> Enemies hitting his shield also trigger dog spawn
[0:49:28] <Solidnick18> WOO
[0:49:34] <%SuperKirby24> he's getting it PogChamp
[0:49:36] <DelgotHansto> If enemies shoot his shield he will summon dog as well

[0:51:50] <Cybermancer> hey woolz dpm
[0:51:55] <%FuqBoiSlim> Games with option Kreygasm
[0:51:55] <megamonmon123> THE SACRED TEXTS
[0:51:56] <+JD0394> Sad there was never an encounter that had the doom hunter and marauder at the same time
[0:51:59] <Cybermancer> dont forget the challenges
[0:52:03] <Cybermancer> for the mission
[0:52:05] <+TheBigTaco> you can change thier sizes too
[0:52:11] <KaiserMario> Wow, how many hours in this game until you finally look down on the menu?
[0:52:12] <%DesertPenguin> When you're out of one shotgun, you're out of both shotguns LUL
[0:52:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> no this is fine
[0:52:23] <%Asuterisuku> The wheel doesn't matter on PC, but console is a different story.
[0:52:24] <%lewdskeletor13> @jd0394 (I’m like 90% sure there is? Or am I crazy)
[0:52:24] <whazat> dunno if it changes how auto-swapping works when you are out, but yeah
[0:52:25] <megamonmon123> Its totally fine woolie
[0:52:30] <%Corporate_Redeemer> TAKE YOUR TIME
[0:52:31] <%trustycoyote> Take your time! No worries, man
[0:52:36] <peachy996> It's better you're comfortable going forward, don't worry
[0:52:39] <megamonmon123> yeah
[0:52:40] <raikagelord1> It’s cool
[0:52:41] <%a_goth_pancake> battle hard fought, cool down my friend
[0:52:42] <+GarboArbo> all good dude
[0:52:48] <RichochetForce> @whazat He can turn off auto-swap when out of ammo
[0:52:55] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Learn the ins and outs of proper weapon swapping
[0:52:56] <DelgotHansto> I have to run the default color for the UI because its the only one which shows which weapons share ammo
[0:53:00] <+rytyoung> WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN SingsMic
[0:53:01] <SomersaultJustice> STRIKE
[0:53:08] <+404cp> now if he would only read the messages about how to get his skins
[0:53:09] <Dakuu75> I remember I customized this then went... nah, nvm, put it on default.
[0:53:18] <%lewdskeletor13> This is totally the git gud level
[0:53:22] <+JD0394> @lewdskeletor13 No sadly there isnt. They are in th same level but not the same encounter. Maybe in a future master level hopefully
[0:53:24] <Jogs_29> custom weapon whee?! is this a new feature? damn i havent updated yet
[0:53:26] <VJdarkworld> ballista near super shotgun?
[0:53:28] <megamonmon123> @dakuu75 yeah I just got used to it
[0:53:33] <resloxxx> Rip and tear semester 1: proper weapon switch management
[0:53:45] <%Asuterisuku> Been there since launch, Jogs.
[0:53:46] <%Javaa01> Oh yeah, Taras Nabad exists to brutalize you to prep you for the last two levels of the game
[0:54:00] <+mckraven> @Jogs_29 Woolie has been playing offline since the start so this wasn't in a patch
[0:54:02] <%lewdskeletor13> @jd0394 I thought the last level did, but now that I’m thinking about it it might have been different waves in the same area
[0:54:11] <%FuqBoiSlim> Seeing games with a shitton of options makes me more bitter about how animal crossing has nothing for its option menu tippitPain
[0:54:13] <%BearSawed> Doomguy comes into the class with a suit over his armor and a briefcase
[0:54:16] <%DesertPenguin> I would switch Rocket Launcher with BFG
[0:54:16] <peachy996> @Javaa01 Four levels imo
[0:54:19] <megamonmon123> yeah that maurader appearance was when I paused tje game and laughed @javaa01
[0:54:21] <%DesertPenguin> You don't use the BFG as much as you'd think
[0:54:28] <Jogs_29> really? i havent notice this feature at all holy shit
[0:54:33] <%Javaa01> @peachy996 Nekravol ain't shit
[0:54:33] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh my god i just got flashbacks to something in this level that threw me way off that pissed me off when I realized what was going on
[0:54:38] <Cybermancer> you can turn off the auto switching to a new gun when you run out of ammo
[0:54:48] <%lewdskeletor13> @cobaltphoenix27 Kappa
[0:54:49] <+JD0394> @lewdskeletor13 Did the level again yesterday they are both in the last building but different floors.
[0:54:54] <BlackermanZX> @WoolieVersus You can turn off auto switch
[0:54:59] <peachy996> @Javaa01 I dunno man the last section of Nekravol 1 was a lot of running around
[0:55:02] <heart_ablaze> THAT ONE SUUUUCKS
[0:55:04] <RunningNGunning> Brown Cacodemon
[0:55:05] <%DesertPenguin> The heavier type
[0:55:05] <megamonmon123> those fuckers
[0:55:07] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @lewdskeletor13 just find it and punch it tho Kappa
[0:55:08] <%lewdskeletor13> @jd0394 ye that’s prob what I was thinking
[0:55:08] <spidervenomized> meatballs
[0:55:10] <megamonmon123> yeah
[0:55:11] <%DesertPenguin> Cacodemon with arms
[0:55:12] <%Asuterisuku> Meatball
[0:55:12] <+YabbaTroll> man fuck that challenge
[0:55:13] <%Corporate_Redeemer> @bearsawed That one Flashgitz animation where Doomguy has to work his way up the corporate ladder in a 9-5 job to take down literal corporate Satan
[0:55:14] <@Solidus_113> above
[0:55:14] <+mckraven> the angry cacao demon
[0:55:16] <DelgotHansto> A tough one when you want to get it
[0:55:17] <%DesertPenguin> front, back, side
[0:55:22] <%Javaa01> It doesn't matter
[0:55:25] <prime_name> Bellow as well?
[0:55:26] <%lewdskeletor13> @cobaltphoenix27 Only secret I had to look up
[0:55:27] <Diana869> above front back
[0:55:27] <%Javaa01> You can still do an above kill
[0:55:28] <%DesertPenguin> or above
[0:55:30] <+murilo182x> You just need to get 3 glory kills
[0:55:31] <+404cp> theres an above kill
[0:55:38] <DelgotHansto> Its under front, above front and back
[0:55:39] <+murilo182x> doesn't need to be unique glory kills
[0:55:43] <%lewdskeletor13> There’s variations
[0:55:47] <+404cp> the above kill on pain elemental is ass
[0:55:47] <%DesertPenguin> I would switch Rockets with BFG but you do you
[0:55:50] <+404cp> bad ass
[0:55:50] <megamonmon123> Also woolie dont forget to switch grenades
[0:55:51] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @lewdskeletor13 oh wait no that was bs took but i'm not talking about a secret
[0:55:55] <%Javaa01> @murilo182x It EXPLICITLY has to be 3 different kills
[0:56:07] <+JD0394> @lewdskeletor13 Fingers crossed in a future master level. Or the dlc
[0:56:15] <%DesertPenguin> Use the Chaingun Shield for the Marauder to chip damage little by little while protecting yourself
[0:56:24] <@Solidus_113> respect the weapons
[0:56:24] <brachydios777> OPTIONS
[0:56:26] <heart_ablaze> I think it sucks that all the flying demon glory kills always center around the eye. that's just me tho
[0:56:29] <peachy996> Switch off of Microwave Beam, It offends me.
[0:56:30] <+paladinstarbuster> ISNT IT
[0:56:33] <DelgotHansto> Level gets significantly less real after that fight
[0:56:33] <+murilo182x> @Javaa01 Nope, did it yesterday on the secret encounter pain elementa, just reload and get 3 glory kills, might be bugged but it works
[0:56:33] <%Corporate_Redeemer> PUT SOME RESPECC
[0:56:33] <+mckraven> i feel like there's be a lot of accidental switching with not being used to the new wheel
[0:56:35] <%lewdskeletor13> Keeping it real
[0:56:36] <RichochetForce> Destroyer Blade noise is SEX
[0:56:38] <+nintega010> what is he doing. practicing quick switch?
[0:56:41] <%DesertPenguin> Microwave Beam gives you radiation poisoning
[0:56:43] <Dakuu75> all them gun beep-boops~ <3
[0:56:44] <peachy996> Thank you
[0:57:09] <+JD0394> @heart_ablaze Well their eye is their biggest week point
[0:57:10] <peachy996> Microwave Beam is a fun gimmick but Shockwave is the real shit
[0:57:14] <thatonepassionbentgamer> Would Doomguy like a gun that talks to him like Dante has with certain weapons?
[0:57:14] <VJdarkworld> @desertpenguin chip what away? cant shoot unless eyes are green. (unless u use remote detonate exploit)
[0:57:20] <$legacy0117> Here we go to some more serious shite boys.
[0:57:23] <umbrellaswereawesome> Microwave's solid as a poor man's stun bomb, but I don't think Woolie quite has the quick switch tech to make it work.
[0:57:23] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[0:57:31] <heart_ablaze> @jd0394 I get that, but some variety is nice
[0:57:34] <%DesertPenguin> If he doesn't have the shield out you can do damage to him. Flame Belch slowly does damage too
[0:57:35] <%shoutofthehobo> woolieS woolieS woolieS woolieS woolieS woolieS woolieS woolieS woolieS woolieS woolieS woolieS woolieS woolieS woolieS
[0:57:39] <%lewdskeletor13> @thatonepassionbentgamer I don’t think he’d really care, unless it was an asshole
[0:57:43] <prime_name> Double Fire is what Zuko was
[0:57:43] <DelgotHansto> Could be more on fire...
[0:57:44] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus You can chainsaw frozen enemies that are on fire to get health, ammo and armor
[0:57:44] <%shoutofthehobo> woolieS woolieS woolieS
[0:57:45] <@Solidus_113> he's missed that hook into point blank shot almost every time
[0:57:46] <megamonmon123> @umbrellaswereawesome yeah no thats high level tech
[0:57:49] <Dakuu75> "You can't be double on fire" Doom Guy would argue that, I think.
[0:57:52] <+JD0394> @heart_ablaze No argument there
[0:58:00] <%DesertPenguin> @solidus_113 cuz he always does that stylin' side dash
[0:58:06] <%BearSawed> sounds like quitter talk to me

[0:58:30] <whazat> Flame Boi
[0:58:30] <VJdarkworld> @desertpenguin but remote detonate is the best for that since it staggers him

[1:06:22] <+YabbaTroll> @Saltmeisterr saying "make you lose it" means its gonna make you mad, "make you lose" makes it seem like it made you fail the no nut november challenge, like the I lost Kreygasm meme

[1:07:17] <somekindaspy> the metal choir is sick
[1:07:18] <+RealThiele> no, fuck it big fun gun
[1:07:23] <DelgotHansto> You totally get tons later on
[1:07:23] <megamonmon123> If you dont wanna fuck it
[1:07:23] <%Javaa01> Arbalest is trivial to do
[1:07:25] <RichochetForce> That final mod makes the turret GODLIKE
[1:07:27] <+arancet> youll get plenty of tokens, dont have to save
[1:07:27] <Hal10k> "fuck this one" is why the tokens exist
[1:07:29] <%DesertPenguin> You don't have to use the token right now
[1:07:33] <megamonmon123> You get enough
[1:07:36] <%DesertPenguin> You don't have to decide right now
[1:07:40] <+JD0394> I know.. BabyRage
[1:07:42] <DelgotHansto> You get like 5 in the next 2 missions
[1:07:43] <RunningNGunning> The game gives you 4-5 mastery tokens by the end of the game iirc
[1:07:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> save em for later
[1:07:46] <Solidnick18> you get more so it's fine
[1:07:50] <%DesertPenguin> You get a few. Save it for later
[1:07:51] <%Javaa01> Heat Blast is worth it to get with a token, that challenge sucks ass
[1:07:54] <%DesertPenguin> Two greandes
[1:08:00] <+RealThiele> missiles dont fire if it will murder you perk not available
[1:08:01] <%DesertPenguin> Second grenade is vital
[1:08:03] <%a_goth_pancake> @fuqboislim sick, thx
[1:08:04] <%DesertPenguin> Or not
[1:08:06] <spidervenomized> upgrade the frag that he wont use
[1:08:07] <%DesertPenguin> LUL
[1:08:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> he has second already
[1:08:10] <megamonmon123> he needs to start switching grenades more
[1:08:18] <$TIME_PUNCHER> "y use mastery tokens, I can pass the challenges just fine"
[1:08:21] <%Javaa01> He needs to rebind grenade switch
[1:08:23] <Solidnick18> this one sucks
[1:08:25] <RogueMinja> This'll be a doozy.
[1:08:34] <megamonmon123> This isnt the hardest one
[1:08:36] <%lewdskeletor13> Kappa

[1:08:44] <@Solidus_113> arbalest
[1:08:50] <megamonmon123> I think chat knows whats the worst challenge is
[1:08:51] <Solidnick18> YEP
[1:08:52] <%DesertPenguin> @WoolieVersus Your equipment is vital. Using Equipment Fiend and switching around your grenades and flame, you literally never run out. You'll always have one of three to choose from if you keep using them. The more you use them the quicker they recharge
[1:08:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> lmao he just saw
[1:08:55] <somekindaspy> just aim for the sled, don't use the plasma on it
[1:08:55] <peachy996> 12 seconds
[1:08:55] <+RealThiele> 30 seconds do it fucker
[1:08:58] <Ner234> He didn't see it LUL
[1:09:08] <%DesertPenguin> This one was tough. You have to use very specific weapons
[1:09:09] <%lewdskeletor13> We all know what the worst challenge is LUL
[1:09:10] <somekindaspy> yeah just skip this one
[1:09:10] <BlackermanZX> @WoolieVersus just use the rocket launcher

[1:09:37] <UvBenServed> Hell leaking out
[1:09:38] <%SuperKirby24> pure evil incarnate LUL
[1:09:39] <VJdarkworld> thats the bethesda CEO in hell
[1:09:40] <peachy996> Lost Soul is literally lost
[1:09:41] <+green715> The lost skulls from Pain Elementals are broken
[1:09:42] <dinnydanny777> I hope this lasts for the rest of the playthrough
[1:09:42] <%Javaa01> Yeah, you need a BFG shot for this
[1:09:44] <+GarboArbo> SATAN
[1:09:45] <+greenfall> lost soul from the pain elemental bugged lol
[1:09:49] <heart_ablaze> THE SOUND OF BETHESDA EMPLOYEES
[1:09:50] <%Javaa01> But woolie botched his BFG shot
[1:09:50] <$legacy0117> HA. x3
[1:09:58] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus you don't have to destroy the shields first to get damage in, you can hit the hover mech. It's not protected
[1:09:59] <+JD0394> Lost souls thrown by pain elementals are broken
[1:09:59] <Solidnick18> don't you gotta punch a statue?
[1:10:00] <%Javaa01> So now he has to do it for real
[1:10:04] <dinnydanny777> I hope we get to the last level as this slowly gets quieter and quieter
[1:10:06] <megamonmon123> you can always come back
[1:10:08] <spidervenomized> wha?
[1:10:12] <megamonmon123> fast travel
[1:10:13] <%HostilePoundcakes> HostilePoundcakes subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! Woolie: lets give this level the respects it deserves Also woolie: Activates secret encounter while in a new encounter and fighting a Arcvile
[1:10:18] <somekindaspy> Yeah, aim for the hover sled if you can. You don't gotta break the shield.
[1:10:20] <%lewdskeletor13> That’s why they’re a challenge!
[1:10:22] <+RealThiele> "The cost of doing them. . . is the cost of doing them" -Woolie 2020
[1:10:22] <+JD0394> Don’t know how they havnt patched that yet
[1:10:22] <peachy996> Lost Soul HATES it
[1:10:24] <whazat> AAAAAAAAAGH
[1:10:24] <dinnydanny777> I hope the sound of the screaming gets more and more distant the further we progress
[1:10:30] <somekindaspy> it will
[1:10:33] <+MajiOMNI> infinite scream
[1:10:36] <Solidnick18> soothing screms
[1:10:38] <BlackermanZX> @WoolieVersus just shoot the sled with the rockets
[1:10:41] <%lewdskeletor13> It’s a Lost Soul clipped into the ground
[1:10:43] <DelgotHansto> The Lost Souls, also known as Fallout 76 developers come from the umbral plains as a manifestation of....
[1:10:44] <+segmentedfool> You don't need to break shield just but the sled
[1:10:46] <megamonmon123> arbalest
[1:10:47] <dinnydanny777> Imagine if this is now the game
[1:10:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> chainsaw fodder when it spawns
[1:10:49] <$legacy0117> When the screams of the damned are the only friends you have.
[1:10:49] <BurdRightsActivist> BLOOD PUNCH the GORE NEST
[1:10:50] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:10:50] <somekindaspy> it's on blade right now

[1:10:56] <+MajiOMNI> shoot the sled, ignore the torso
[1:10:57] <%Javaa01> You mean the shot Woolie wasted on a single zombie?
[1:10:57] <UvBenServed> Rubbing salt in the wound
[1:11:02] <dinnydanny777> Twice the screams now
[1:11:04] <Solidnick18> remember to get the execution on the pain elemental

[1:11:18] <somekindaspy> nope
[1:11:29] <@Solidus_113> don't shoot the shields
[1:11:29] <somekindaspy> Woolie, don't focus on his shield. just focus on his floating sled
[1:11:30] <$legacy0117> BFG IT
[1:11:31] <+RealThiele> gotta get right in that tankhole
[1:11:32] <+segmentedfool> STOP BREAKING THE SHIELD
[1:11:33] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @WoolieVersus ignore the shield just aim at the sled
[1:11:34] <%DesertPenguin> so close
[1:11:34] <%nawji> did I miss the cool thing?
[1:11:35] <whazat> you don't have to remove the shield to do damage to the sled, and when the sled is dead the shield goes away anyway
[1:11:36] <BlackermanZX> Woolie no dont shoot the shield
[1:11:37] <RichochetForce> OOF
[1:11:39] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Don't forget to check map for more secrets
[1:11:43] <megamonmon123> GG
[1:11:44] <Solidnick18> yeah this one is annoying
[1:11:48] <dukenux> So @WoolieVersus is there a new weapon that fills Gauss Chan shaped hole in this?
[1:11:48] <$legacy0117> Ugh. Ammo wasted.
[1:11:52] <+greenfall> skip shield attack the sled
[1:11:54] <RogueMinja> Chaingun it til it dies.
[1:11:56] <spidervenomized> chainsaw the fodder demon

[1:12:21] <peachy996> You can come back to this later, in fact you will be rewarded for doing such
[1:12:22] <UvBenServed> This one's fun
[1:12:23] <brachydios777> Chaingunning the Doom Hunter sled is good strats
[1:12:27] <%DesertPenguin> Come back later with cheats
[1:12:27] <dinnydanny777> I hope we reach the last boss and as it approaches we hear that exact scream, looped in the exact same way
[1:12:28] <%Reveresao> ice bomb him & destroy the shed @woolieversus
[1:12:29] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> yeah fuck autocorrect
[1:12:38] <megamonmon123> i dont think woolie needs batteries now does he?
[1:12:44] <%DesertPenguin> Good fucking luck finding the switch
[1:12:47] <@Solidus_113> Come back later for cleanup, there's a lot more level to do
[1:12:48] <$legacy0117> This Slayer challenge is pretty rough.
[1:12:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> switch off the blade
[1:12:52] <peachy996> Needs Batteries for those outfits
[1:13:01] <heart_ablaze> wait wat
[1:13:03] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> yeah the switch is a bitch to find
[1:13:04] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus If you want this battery, you will be stuck here for 10 minutes, with instructions. Also, you don't need it, you have everything on the ship except the skins which you can't use
[1:13:05] <%DesertPenguin> Ice bomb and destroy the sled
[1:13:08] <Dakuu75> oh damn, I remember getting stuck trying to figure out this secret. fuck this one.
[1:13:12] <Monkeyweed21> just chaingun the sled
[1:13:14] <+RealThiele> freeze them shield generators
[1:13:17] <+rytyoung> nope nope nope just his butt
[1:13:21] <whazat> the shield exists, but you don't have to get rid of it to damage the sled
[1:13:22] <+green715> The sled isn't shielded
[1:13:26] <megamonmon123> yep
[1:13:27] <peachy996> Ice Bomb and Plasma Rifle+ Shockwave fuck its day up
[1:13:33] <@Solidus_113> Sled isn't protected
[1:13:40] <lotharrio> Shoot his booty apparently.
[1:13:41] <brachydios777> Chain gun sled
[1:13:44] <RogueMinja> Shoot the sled til it dies.
[1:13:44] <%Reveresao> ice bomb freezes him in place allow you to destroy the sled
[1:13:45] <+greenfall> theres a breakable wall in a corner its not highlighted
[1:13:51] <Ozmodyas> Yeah, never needed to take down the shield before Blood Punching the sled
[1:13:54] <+RealThiele> shoot bang gun to victoryu
[1:13:54] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that's fair they do try to make you do that, but it's unecessary
[1:14:02] <megamonmon123> look at the statues
[1:14:03] <%lewdskeletor13> Woolie-vision LUL
[1:14:06] <peachy996> and here we go
[1:14:11] <$legacy0117> Good luck. Hope you get Chainsaw fuel while waiting.
[1:14:15] <Dakuu75> buckle in bois
[1:14:16] <somekindaspy> those are punchable anyway
[1:14:18] <Monkeyweed21> see you guts in an hour
[1:14:18] <Solidnick18> check behind the statues
[1:14:20] <KaiserMario> There's a switch you need to find, goos luck
[1:14:24] <Monkeyweed21> guys
[1:14:24] <+segmentedfool> I don't think he'll find the button for that without help
[1:14:27] <RogueMinja> This secret is pretty hidden.
[1:14:30] <+greenfall> lo
[1:14:30] <%lewdskeletor13> These secrets are gonna make you tear your hair out
[1:14:31] <%Javaa01> You will not find the thing to trigger this
[1:14:33] <megamonmon123> its fucking hard
[1:14:36] <peachy996> I won't blame woolie for getting stumped
[1:14:37] <BlackermanZX> he will figure it out eventuallu
[1:14:37] <DelgotHansto> The intended kill route for Doom Hunter is unoptimal and pointless
[1:14:45] <+green715> Even with a guide I had trouble finding the button
[1:14:48] <somekindaspy> switch to your arbalest
[1:14:49] <brachydios777> Statue with a crack
[1:14:53] <+boomer059> I had to use the BFG for this one
[1:14:53] <somekindaspy> stop using the destroyer blade
[1:14:53] <Monkeyweed21> switch to arbalest
[1:15:00] <Dakuu75> He'll ask for help if he wants it. guys, keep it in your pants
[1:15:02] <pennykettle_> I hate that the "secrets" in this game are mandatory things that viewers get angry if you dont find. If you cant find a secret that should be normal
[1:15:03] <%cobalt_phoenix_> switch mod
[1:15:05] <somekindaspy> you're on the destroyer blade
[1:15:08] <+greenfall> i spent way too long looking for the switch here
[1:15:16] <megamonmon123> gg
[1:15:19] <$legacy0117> There ya go.
[1:15:25] <somekindaspy> jeeeez

[1:15:52] <megamonmon123> you got this woolie
[1:15:53] <heart_ablaze> no a zombie killed ya
[1:15:54] <Klarrann3> Do NOT use lock-on if it has shields active, it wastes ammo
[1:15:58] <$legacy0117> Pain Elemental hurts a lottt.
[1:16:01] <%a_goth_pancake> Doomguy's animal crossing sound effect is "unf".
[1:16:02] <megamonmon123> chat, give woolie his energy
[1:16:05] <+RealThiele> doomslayer doesnt die like a btich anymore
[1:16:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> gib
[1:16:14] <Ozmodyas> Oh hey, you have all your ammo now
[1:16:18] <whazat> 2016 had way cooler death animations for sure
[1:16:18] <heart_ablaze> that still there
[1:16:22] <%Javaa01> Yeah, they took those out to make things run faster
[1:16:23] <pennykettle_> I think I like 2016 more than Eternal FeelsBadMan
[1:16:30] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you're on the blade again
[1:16:31] <somekindaspy> the idea is that you aren't forced to watch an animation so you can just load back as fast as you can
[1:16:34] <%SirGO0SE> GivePLZ energy
[1:16:35] <DSD24> @pennykettle_ I feel the same
[1:16:38] <heart_ablaze> @pennykettle_ yeah I agree
[1:16:40] <DatAsuna> @pennykettle_ same tbh
[1:16:43] <$legacy0117> Also sled is not the main target when locking on with rockets
[1:16:43] <%Asuterisuku> I'm pretty sure it was cut because it didn't play nice with Extra Lives.
[1:16:47] <DelgotHansto> You should probably farm pain elemental glory kills here< there are only three in the level otherwise
[1:16:58] <resloxxx> NotLikeThis
[1:17:01] <DatAsuna> I feel like Eternal makes the game more mobile but also turns it into almost an arkham game
[1:17:03] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wrong mod
[1:17:05] <%a_goth_pancake> tHE PAAAaaAAAAAINNN
[1:17:07] <Monkeyweed21> Woolie you have to hit them
[1:17:07] <heart_ablaze> i think it's just that 2016 had more of an impact
[1:17:08] <somekindaspy> i would recommend using the faster glory kills rune for this one
[1:17:13] <+paladinstarbuster> arbalest does more damage
[1:17:17] <+rytyoung> @pennykettle_ I like doom 2016's atmosphere over eternal, but eternals gameplay is so damn fun
[1:17:19] <%DesertPenguin> F A I L
[1:17:22] <pennykettle_> the lock on hits the shield not the sled
[1:17:28] <Solidnick18> if only woolie had bfg
[1:17:29] <$legacy0117> Got heal and ammo though.
[1:17:29] <+RealThiele> despawn gun
[1:17:32] <+paladinstarbuster> DONT BE SORRY
[1:17:33] <DelgotHansto> If only
[1:17:35] <whazat> the real Doom Eternal starts here
[1:17:36] <peachy996> And the Lost Soul is once again lost
[1:17:36] <megamonmon123> dont lock on, just shoot the sled manually
[1:17:43] <megamonmon123> Dont lock on when hes frozen
[1:17:46] <Klarrann3> do NOT use lock on against the shield @WoolieVersus
[1:17:47] <RogueMinja> Chaingun the sled.
[1:17:47] <+mckraven> bfg would be pretty helpful
[1:17:50] <BlackermanZX> arbalest instead of blade can help
[1:17:51] <Monkeyweed21> Chaingun
[1:17:53] <spidervenomized> @rytyoung best way i could phrase it
[1:17:55] <peachy996> Yes do later, good decision
[1:18:02] <+greenfall> its alright woolie this is real dark souls now
[1:18:02] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus Stop using Lock-On missiles against the Hunter, it targets it's upper body, meaning it does ZERO damage on the first phase unless you destroy his shield
[1:18:06] <%DesertPenguin> shield
[1:18:22] <megamonmon123> Dont lock on when hes on the sled
[1:18:25] <dinnydanny777> Max your DPS
[1:18:34] <+paladinstarbuster> USE ARBALEST ON CACO
[1:18:39] <pennykettle_> This level is a doozy so dont get weary
[1:18:40] <@Solidus_113> Auto Shotgun does good damage too
[1:18:41] <strifer413> I like the art design of eternal a lot more, and the enemy variety + weapons. 2016 feels longer and has more consistency tho (and better lore)
[1:18:43] <$legacy0117> If you can double later, then you could try then. But whatever you feel like Woolz.
[1:18:52] <%DesertPenguin> nope
[1:18:56] <%DesertPenguin> that waste of time was it
[1:19:02] <pennykettle_> PogChamp
[1:19:07] <peachy996> I like the Eternal OST more but I need to give 2016 a serious listen
[1:19:11] <whazat> now do violence quickyl

[1:19:38] <%DesertPenguin> If you didn't fuck up the chaingun at first you'd be better off but still lucky
[1:19:40] <pennykettle_> The basic shotguns sticky grenades feel great
[1:19:42] <%BisoromiBear> It's all about the W
[1:19:43] <%DesertPenguin> nope
[1:19:44] <dinnydanny777> That's how you play Doom Woolie
[1:19:44] <somekindaspy> G freaking G

[1:19:55] <brachydios777> CLUTCH
[1:19:57] <RogueMinja> Look at the stayus upstairs.
[1:20:00] <+mckraven> Photo finishes are the best kinds
[1:20:03] <dinnydanny777> Shoot until it's dead is a valid strategy
[1:20:04] <Vohs_Bru> Doesnt matter if you win by 9 minutes or 1sec WINNING IS WINNING
[1:20:06] <Calek> 0.56 left on the clock
[1:20:06] <megamonmon123> look around the statues
[1:20:08] <%FuqBoiSlim> WE TAKE THOSE
[1:20:12] <%DesertPenguin> No hints. Let this take forever
[1:20:13] <SaiyanShoto> Woolie is DOOM
[1:20:15] <Spliffdonk> massive dub bossman
[1:20:15] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> I remember from Pat's stream that this secret sucks ass. Good luck.
[1:20:18] <somekindaspy> get ready to swim
[1:20:20] <dinnydanny777> Blasting until it's dead is a very valid strategy Woolie
[1:20:22] <Ozmodyas> Wait, does he need to get that Mastery Token again?
[1:20:22] <+rytyoung> WE TAKE THOSE LUL
[1:20:23] <peachy996> Honestly I used THAT weapon for this challenge and never looked back
[1:20:27] <%DesertPenguin> I had trouble finding this and I used a fucking guide
[1:20:31] <whazat> it opened up the pool
[1:20:32] <%SuperKirby24> C for clutch Kappa
[1:20:34] <snake_zen> Water
[1:20:38] <@Solidus_113> this sucks
[1:20:39] <CoffeeSlice> LUL
[1:20:40] <pennykettle_> water levels PogChamp
[1:20:41] <Solidnick18> LUL
[1:20:44] <+demegodz> Worst part of the game
[1:20:45] <%DesertPenguin> Another secret being missed tho
[1:20:50] <$legacy0117> OUCH
[1:20:51] <%DesertPenguin> LUL LUL LUL
[1:20:51] <spidervenomized> THE WORST LEVEL IN THE GAME
[1:20:52] <RichochetForce> YAMEROOOO
[1:20:52] <+rytyoung> we swimming

[1:20:59] <megamonmon123> this isnt great
[1:20:59] <somekindaspy> yeah the swimming levels suck.
[1:21:00] <%a_goth_pancake> dad water DansGame
[1:21:00] <%DesertPenguin> Just keep hitting jump
[1:21:01] <+mckraven> You can
[1:21:01] <BlackermanZX> you can
[1:21:01] <xbb1024> There was a rad suite
[1:21:02] <dinnydanny777> Do the Water Temple
[1:21:02] <+rytyoung> LUL
[1:21:03] <somekindaspy> you have to dash under water
[1:21:04] <spidervenomized> no you cant
[1:21:05] <peachy996> You can jump but it sucks
[1:21:05] <$legacy0117> That, was painful to watch.
[1:21:06] <+MajiOMNI> too heavy
[1:21:06] <SaiyanShoto> Ohhh this part
[1:21:06] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> that killed me too
[1:21:07] <somekindaspy> dash under water
[1:21:07] <snake_zen> different spot
[1:21:07] <%FuqBoiSlim> fam what?
[1:21:09] <Vohs_Bru> Wolverine physics
[1:21:09] <%Javaa01> You can jump out of the water, but you have to come at it from a 90 degree angle
[1:21:09] <derap41> Sewer level incoming
[1:21:09] <megamonmon123> yep
[1:21:12] <brachydios777> LUL
[1:21:12] <megamonmon123> YEP
[1:21:14] <somekindaspy> to break the stupid thing
[1:21:16] <megamonmon123> its BAD
[1:21:18] <RichochetForce> Sewer Swimming Level Activated.
[1:21:18] <peachy996> You have to struggle to jump out of the water
[1:21:20] <pennykettle_> flashbacks to being the fat kid that couldnt pull himself out of the pool
[1:21:21] <somekindaspy> stupidest level in the game but you need that sword
[1:21:22] <+Caped_Eggy> Doom slayer died by drowning
[1:21:29] <xbb1024> Get the rad suit in the area
[1:21:32] <+nintega010> the underwater seems to be peoples least favorite
[1:21:34] <+RealThiele> then it resets the challenge too LUL
[1:21:34] <%Javaa01> I mean, he only died cause he didn't pick up the rad suit
[1:21:34] <+MajiOMNI> rad suit
[1:21:35] <Ozmodyas> Does he still have the secret challenge complete?
[1:21:40] <Calek> why is the first underwater pool immediately trying to kill you, who designed this
[1:21:42] <$legacy0117> PLEASE tell me the Slayer gate stays gone.
[1:21:45] <%a_goth_pancake> now go do the challenge again
[1:21:54] <megamonmon123> he has it
[1:21:57] <somekindaspy> no the challenge stays gone
[1:21:57] <snake_zen> no you have not picked up the rad suit
[1:21:59] <%DesertPenguin> S E C R E T S
[1:22:00] <somekindaspy> it's all good
[1:22:06] <RichochetForce> Now we're RAD
[1:22:08] <DelgotHansto> This time earth will be different, Sam says to a drowning DoomGuy
[1:22:09] <somekindaspy> you gotta dash into the green wall
[1:22:10] <megamonmon123> check the statues
[1:22:10] <$legacy0117> GOOD.
[1:22:12] <%a_goth_pancake> just for gits and shiggles
[1:22:14] <Solidnick18> the secrets are well hidden
[1:22:15] <+mckraven> this area has some annoying secrets
[1:22:16] <%DesertPenguin> dash all the time
[1:22:21] <%DesertPenguin> MOAR
[1:22:21] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus Do not bother with that battery, it's not worth it, you have everything that affects gameplay that batteries can give you
[1:22:24] <+RealThiele> fuck dat wtaer
[1:22:33] <%DesertPenguin> Go up sides
[1:22:33] <somekindaspy> it's nasty sewer water
[1:22:35] <whazat> do swimming
[1:22:37] <somekindaspy> you gotta climb the wall bro
[1:22:38] <peachy996> It's a one time mechanic thankfully
[1:22:46] <pennykettle_> people hate the water parts but people also somehow hate the platforming which feels like it could be its own game
[1:22:46] <%a_goth_pancake> that's a classic ass fps sound effect
[1:22:48] <%DesertPenguin> You have to jump out
[1:22:49] <somekindaspy> climb that climbable wall
[1:22:54] <megamonmon123> its not a common thing
[1:22:54] <+mckraven> just jump
[1:22:55] <%DesertPenguin> You jump out, not dash out
[1:23:05] <snake_zen> jump not dash
[1:23:05] <dinnydanny777> ECCO the Dolphin was such a good game
[1:23:08] <peachy996> Don't look down there
[1:23:16] <%Javaa01> Time for puzzles, and thinking
[1:23:16] <peachy996> Map is spoiling you
[1:23:21] <DelgotHansto> ECCO scared kid me to death and I dont know why
[1:23:24] <+GarboArbo> jump and climb
[1:23:25] <DatAsuna> If you had bumper jump aerial movement and dashing would be ez :P
[1:23:27] <peachy996> Retain your blindness
[1:23:27] <DelgotHansto> I have afear of water now tho
[1:23:33] <%a_goth_pancake> look down there Kappa
[1:23:39] <dinnydanny777> ECCO should scare everyone to death, have you seen the secret boss?
[1:23:42] <xbb1024> shoot
[1:23:43] <somekindaspy> gotta shoot it
[1:23:45] <pennykettle_> crouching is for cowards
[1:23:51] <RichochetForce> Shoot it!
[1:23:51] <somekindaspy> shoot that thing at the end of the hall way
[1:23:51] <%DesertPenguin> There was crouch in 2016 and they took it out
[1:23:54] <somekindaspy> that tunnel
[1:23:55] <snake_zen> GUN
[1:23:55] <%Javaa01> They took crouching out cause it's a worthless bind, 2016 had it though
[1:23:56] <+mckraven> use the power of gun
[1:23:58] <%DesertPenguin> No one crouched in 2016
[1:23:59] <+greenfall> shoot the green
[1:23:59] <%a_goth_pancake> why can't doom crouch
[1:24:01] <megamonmon123> shoot
[1:24:03] <DatAsuna> crouching is pointless without sliding tbh
[1:24:05] <megamonmon123> shoot the green
[1:24:11] <somekindaspy> now go down
[1:24:18] <dinnydanny777> When's the ECCO the Dolphin reboot
[1:24:21] <%DesertPenguin> Crouching is pointless in a game that revolves around MOVEMENT
[1:24:25] <DatAsuna> also, crouching belongs on R3, don't @ me
[1:24:30] <somekindaspy> nobody likes it
[1:24:30] <%DesertPenguin> I agree
[1:24:30] <DelgotHansto> @dinnydanny777 Oh no I haven't I never got anywhere in that game just gave me anxiety< please don't awaken my omnifears
[1:24:32] <Calek> no one likes that mechanic
[1:24:33] <spidervenomized> ECCO the dolphin movie
[1:24:36] <%DesertPenguin> It's more tactical that way
[1:24:37] <%Asuterisuku> The crouch was antithetical to "DON'T STOP MOVING."
[1:24:38] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> You are right!
[1:24:45] <+greenfall> swimming is not good, worst part of the game imo
[1:24:45] <derap41> So Sams talkative now
[1:24:45] <peachy996> It's gone after this level
[1:24:50] <pennykettle_> yea just wait til you get to the underwater sharkdemons
[1:24:50] <%DesertPenguin> That flame is so fucking annoying
[1:24:51] <megamonmon123> You dont do it after this
[1:24:56] <somekindaspy> Hmmm how does he know it? think think
[1:24:58] <brachydios777> Water out of nowhere
[1:25:01] <+pizzahoboX> what difficulty is this?
[1:25:04] <%FuqBoiSlim> there's a crouch button?
[1:25:05] <VJdarkworld> he did it for the peepeepoopooo
[1:25:09] <+mckraven> yeah swimming isn't really fun in this game
[1:25:10] <%FuqBoiSlim> @pizzahobox hurt me plenty
[1:25:10] <%DesertPenguin> What is he trying to do?
[1:25:23] <RichochetForce> 5 enemies killed in one turret deployed
[1:25:27] <%nawji> this is Hurt Me Plenty according to when I asked chat when he started
[1:25:31] <VJdarkworld> thats rough, buddy
[1:25:34] <megamonmon123> its hurt me plenty
[1:25:37] <DatAsuna> @FuqBoiSlim there was int he last game but not this one
[1:25:37] <%a_goth_pancake> ammo go down
[1:25:38] <pennykettle_> thats rough, buddy
[1:25:49] <somekindaspy> secret button
[1:25:57] <megamonmon123> grenade switching
[1:26:02] <%Javaa01> Green glowy on the right in front of you btw
[1:26:16] <somekindaspy> Atlans are the mechs btw
[1:26:16] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:26:19] <brachydios777> Story time
[1:26:31] <Dark_Wint3r> Ligma Sultagenta
[1:26:35] <somekindaspy> lol
[1:26:42] <%lewdskeletor13> brownS
[1:26:58] <%DesertPenguin> They made it up
[1:26:58] <DatAsuna> For some reason this one makes me nostalgic for metroid prime 2 lore
[1:27:06] <Ozmodyas> Interfector is just a Synonym for Slayer
[1:27:07] <somekindaspy> interfector m (genitive interfectōris); third declension killer, murderer, slayer destroyer
[1:27:08] <+YabbaTroll> it means slayer?
[1:27:16] <dinnydanny777> The fighters of Argenta huh
[1:27:19] <%vaderxyz1970> Interfector = SLAYER
[1:27:21] <pennykettle_> sounds like a fighter from another place? Interstate, Interfector?
[1:27:27] <DelgotHansto> Google says it means dark one in Latin
[1:27:28] <umbrellaswereawesome> It's Latin for Slayer.
[1:27:32] <dinnydanny777> Of "Argenta" huh
[1:27:32] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Killer in Latin (says the internet)
[1:27:32] <%lewdskeletor13> breebuD
[1:27:34] <%vaderxyz1970> Latin
[1:27:34] <somekindaspy> yes it is a real word
[1:27:34] <whazat> interfetor is a real world
[1:27:36] <%Javaa01> It's Latin
[1:27:36] <kei_ar_> Woolie VS Metroid Prime WHen
[1:27:37] <somekindaspy> it's an archaic word
[1:27:39] <somekindaspy> it's latin
[1:27:42] <umbrellaswereawesome> LOL ONE GUY.
[1:27:45] <%a_goth_pancake> that fucking mother for, I swear
[1:27:48] <DelgotHansto> Okay maybe its slayer
[1:27:48] <DatAsuna> the believe in an ideal is to be willing to betray it.
[1:27:48] <+l3sovikk> Killer in Latin
[1:27:50] <somekindaspy> LOL
[1:27:54] <VJdarkworld> D:
[1:28:00] <%ECRead> so not a word Kappa
[1:28:02] <DelgotHansto> IT MEANS BAD DUDE

[1:28:55] <peachy996> Why does a Sentinel know Latin anyway?
[1:28:56] <DatAsuna> @DesertPenguin I would assume gamecube cause it's easier to emulate with less hassle and preserves the title screen intros
[1:28:58] <dinnydanny777> That's metal

[1:30:07] <dinnydanny777> Through the fires and the flames huh
[1:30:22] <pennykettle_> Do you think modern day Doom is going to create middle school edgelords trying to act like doomguy
[1:30:22] <%Javaa01> Words can't kill demons, unfettered rage can tho
[1:30:24] <%DesertPenguin> Demon Land is my favorite amusement park!
[1:30:47] <RichochetForce> Yeah, this shit is sacriligious
[1:30:47] <+RealThiele> IRIS!
[1:30:56] <arkv01> what am I FIGHTING FOOOOR
[1:31:08] <%DesertPenguin> And then it isn't
[1:31:10] <%a_goth_pancake> every time I hear doomguy going "unfunfunfunf" over and over again I picture him walking into locked door
[1:31:12] <%lewdskeletor13> blasphemy
[1:31:18] <pennykettle_> Essentially the Sentinels split into two factions, one is allied with the Khan Maykr, the other stayed independent
[1:31:23] <dinnydanny777> And everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked
[1:31:28] <$legacy0117> Latin, is kind of one of the most important languages of relaying biblical text. Tis probably how a Devil game of this magnitude exists, and where a lot of their research into this genre came from.
[1:31:34] <somekindaspy> You'll find out. She fucked up.
[1:31:34] <%Javaa01> She figured out that Argent is the GOOD hit
[1:31:36] <umbrellaswereawesome> You'll figure it out when you find more lore.
[1:31:41] <somekindaspy> ^

[1:32:11] <pennykettle_> Lothric Castle shit
[1:32:15] <brachydios777> @lewdskeletor13 I’d love a dlc during that era
[1:32:26] <dinnydanny777> A lot of these rooms remind me of Darksiders 2
[1:32:27] <$legacy0117> Watch young Woolz.

[1:32:52] <peachy996> @pennykettle_ Nah but I could have a go at some of those demons
[1:32:55] <xbb1024> I think the sentenals you encountered were just guards.
[1:32:55] <WanderingSwordsman> There was a civil war

[1:35:18] <somekindaspy> Reggie you're the boss
[1:35:22] <somekindaspy> oh god that's an ugly texture
[1:35:24] <+TheBigTaco> weird that a button essentially unveils another button
[1:35:24] <%dekkitout> When we getting Arctic Assault Mancubus
[1:35:24] <+quico96> bugthesda
[1:35:27] <%a_goth_pancake> MANC WITH OCULUS RIFT
[1:35:28] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Fight that z
[1:35:31] <%DappercatEsquire> The Z Fighters here already?
[1:35:33] <+RealThiele> hide them ugly textures in the ceiling
[1:35:45] <%Double_Tap_That> Fighting Z Texture Team
[1:35:48] <RichochetForce> On the next episode find out if Commander LOD will be victorious!
[1:35:49] <$legacy0117> Those things get overlooked in so many games.
[1:35:52] <RogueMinja> Go back to the courtyard for the battery.
[1:35:53] <%cobalt_phoenix_> other room
[1:35:54] <somekindaspy> I dont even remember those ones
[1:35:54] <coreybom> The puzzles here are kinda weird. Like compared to the rest of the game, their off.
[1:35:56] <%dekkitout> Texture texture, rock the texture, Fighting Texture Z!
[1:35:58] <umbrellaswereawesome> Wait for the quick travel on this one.
[1:35:59] <somekindaspy> go back to the courtyard from before
[1:36:00] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> My memory is it's hidden in bullshit in the other room.
[1:36:02] <$Futurecity10> in the previous area is another breakable statue
[1:36:04] <DelgotHansto> Can he even get back there through the sewer
[1:36:04] <mige_> that's a hard one
[1:36:05] <@Solidus_113> the solution for that one kinda sucks
[1:36:09] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> But I don't remember what specific bullshit.
[1:36:14] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus The same concept in that other room, with a breakable statue with a button behind it, but it's borderline impossible to see due to the lighting
[1:36:16] <peachy996> DON'T LOOK DOWN THERE, damn you
[1:36:19] <@Solidus_113> back through the RADS
[1:36:22] <peachy996> Stupid Automap
[1:36:24] <@Solidus_113> not worth it
[1:36:25] <somekindaspy> ugh woof
[1:36:25] <brachydios777> I had to look it up
[1:36:28] <%a_goth_pancake> you're best served progressing @woolieversus
[1:36:30] <somekindaspy> you wanna skip this? do it later?
[1:36:43] <%a_goth_pancake> this room suck ass
[1:36:45] <%Double_Tap_That> There's another breakable statue in the room adjacent to the battery
[1:36:51] <Solidnick18> did he find secret
[1:36:54] <brachydios777> OCD
[1:36:59] <%DesertPenguin> Double Tap, shhh
[1:37:03] <peachy996> Struggle with the water
[1:37:04] <somekindaspy> yeah nah this game's weird swimming puzzles really do suck
[1:37:07] <pennykettle_> the final boss is an underwater leviathan :)
[1:37:10] <+l3sovikk> Underwater and goo are the worst parts of this game
[1:37:12] <+greenfall> HALL WUG woolie
[1:37:13] <%Javaa01> It's only in this level, so I think the devs know it blows too
[1:37:14] <VJdarkworld> mh3 be like
[1:37:15] <DeathByPoke7> its up there with the goo
[1:37:15] <somekindaspy> gotta punch a statue
[1:37:16] <%DesertPenguin> It's subtle but you'll find it
[1:37:16] <+demegodz> Punch a statue
[1:37:17] <+RealThiele> Icon of Water Levels
[1:37:18] <dinnydanny777> You don't like the water temple?
[1:37:19] <spidervenomized> link would approve
[1:37:21] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> What games have nailed swimming anyway?
[1:37:26] <%a_goth_pancake> underwater in Duke 3d was better, change my mind
[1:37:26] <+rytyoung> weirdly enough it's only for one level LUL
[1:37:32] <%Javaa01> It is another broken statue
[1:37:33] <mar_krow> radioactive water
[1:37:33] <+segmentedfool> It's behind a punchable statue
[1:37:35] <RichochetForce> @Spudnacious_Dynasty PRECIOUS few
[1:37:49] <+TheBigTaco> I mean they could be better, but they are also dependent on how well people can traverse it
[1:37:50] <%Javaa01> Look for kneeling statues
[1:37:51] <%lewdskeletor13> The Doomslayer can breathe in space but not in water for some reason
[1:37:53] <@Solidus_113> look for a small glow
[1:37:57] <%DesertPenguin> Did Ratchet & Clank games have swimming?
[1:37:57] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Brothers?
[1:37:58] <pennykettle_> oh no
[1:37:58] <+greenfall> oof
[1:38:00] <%Javaa01> And you ran right past it
[1:38:00] <megamonmon123> statues

[1:38:06] <+segmentedfool> And he walked straight past it
[1:38:07] <+RealThiele> poop water is gross OKAY
[1:38:09] <%DesertPenguin> It's too subtle
[1:38:10] <dinnydanny777> Majora's Mask had great swimming with the Zora Mask, shame 3D didn't do it great
[1:38:10] <Solidnick18> lol

[1:51:36] <umbrellaswereawesome> Tester Woolie strikes again!
[1:51:36] <%tearfuldevil> i missed it
[1:51:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> PogChamp
[1:51:37] <VJdarkworld> works fine for me
[1:51:37] <+Milpool> PogChamp
[1:51:38] <Solidnick18> don't worry about it
[1:51:39] <+rytyoung> PogChamp
[1:51:39] <%tearfuldevil> clip please
[1:51:42] <ShakeTheW> Glory killed him to the Shadow Realm
[1:51:43] <DelgotHansto> wait what happened I looked away

[1:51:44] <BlackermanZX> Gum hunter
[1:51:44] <spidervenomized> BUGTHESETA
[1:51:46] <+greenfall> thanks Todd
[1:51:47] <%FuqBoiSlim> 20 SUBS???
[1:51:47] <+segmentedfool> stabbyHideo
[1:51:48] <peachy996> That looked more painful than the normal version
[1:51:49] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Don't worry about that.
[1:51:49] <%SuperKirby24> PogChamp
[1:51:51] <WanderingSwordsman> PogChamp
[1:51:53] <+TheBigTaco> Is this the unpatched version of the game?
[1:51:53] <$legacy0117> That is what happens when your arm blade can cut through the 5TH WALL
[1:51:53] <+MajiOMNI> this game is definitely a bit buggy compared to 2016
[1:51:54] <%ECRead> I unironically LOVE texture stretching
[1:51:55] <%a_goth_pancake> woolie why are you like this
[1:51:56] <%FuqBoiSlim> CLIP AND SHIP IT LUL
[1:52:00] <%Gruhunchously> The game is shattering before our eyes
[1:52:02] <+nintega010> @solidus_113 ok I figured. Cause he definitely isn't moving as fast as Max when he was playing doom, but max is good at fps
[1:52:07] <%Javaa01> No secrets, only puzzles
[1:52:16] <Solidnick18> yummy purple room
[1:52:19] <xbb1024> did he miss a question mark?
[1:52:26] <resloxxx> No
[1:52:27] <somekindaspy> i dont know actually
[1:52:27] <pennykettle_> I didnt clip it. If anyone missed it, Woolie did a glory kill on a Doom Hunter and it stretched out the limbs and the texture was all stretchy like the limbs in Spore
[1:52:30] <Mrthefro> PogChamp
[1:52:36] <%FuqBoiSlim> Another Slayer Cave another PogChamp moment
[1:52:38] <RichochetForce> @nintega010 Max was born in the COD. Made men by the COD. He died by the COD. Fear the old COD.
[1:52:39] <+Mecha_G> @WoolieVersus who are you hoping to see in SFV?
[1:52:46] <%Javaa01> The floor is not the answer to the puzzle
[1:52:53] <+nintega010> @richochetforce lol. yep
[1:52:56] <$legacy0117> Bugthesda everybody! chilledFINE
[1:52:57] <usurper_sos> Do puzzle
[1:53:00] <snake_zen> POUNCH
[1:53:04] <RogueMinja> Look for green.
[1:53:13] <+eiightbiitt> sooo what is the 43 gauge above his health and armour I dont remember seeing that in my playthrough.
[1:53:14] <%a_goth_pancake> tick tock tick tock
[1:53:18] <pennykettle_> I just realized how goofy and awesome it is that the Sentinels had coordinated punch switches in their society LUL
[1:53:26] <@Solidus_113> rad suit @eiightbiitt
[1:53:37] <spidervenomized> it was already leaked
[1:53:38] <+RealThiele> bethesda actually do art books?
[1:53:38] <%Javaa01> Yes that green
[1:53:41] <+eiightbiitt> oh right I forgot
[1:53:46] <+greenfall> yes that green
[1:53:51] <+404cp> the artbook for doom eternal has been out for months
[1:53:51] <$legacy0117> Yeppp. They are all basically Mandoloriansss
[1:53:52] <+eiightbiitt> thanks
[1:53:54] <raikagelord1> Ain’t the art Book already out? I think it is.
[1:53:57] <+segmentedfool> Looks straight at it. "not that green"
[1:54:00] <+404cp> you can find it online
[1:54:05] <DelgotHansto> Punch switches are ULTRA secure cause only BIG BADDASSES can use them
[1:54:07] <%a_goth_pancake> @pennykettle_ "hang on, I'll buzz you in" *falcon pawnch*
[1:54:13] <$legacy0117> But less guns, and more Meleee
[1:54:17] <%FuqBoiSlim> art book was a pre-order bonus right? along with the soundtrack
[1:54:26] <somekindaspy> yup
[1:54:26] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:54:27] <@Solidus_113> they're hyping it up
[1:54:34] <pennykettle_> @a_goth_pancake I just watched Uncut Gems so the phrase "punch me in" makes my eye twitch
[1:54:38] <spidervenomized> @RealThiele yes there a art book that was leaked before the game was out
[1:54:38] <brachydios777> @fuqboislim I think
[1:54:41] <+404cp> artbook can be bought separately or you can find scans online
[1:54:45] <somekindaspy> ugh more sewers :/
[1:54:49] <+RealThiele> aight neat
[1:54:55] <+demegodz> Oh
[1:54:58] <+demegodz> Oh boy
[1:55:00] <+greenfall> another water puzzle incoming
[1:55:03] <DelgotHansto> Final slayer gate comin up
[1:55:03] <+greenfall> oof
[1:55:09] <%Javaa01> Go punch the purple door anyways, for LP funsies
[1:55:12] <+demegodz> 1 hour on this section
[1:55:22] <@Solidus_113> Rad was a mechanic in the original games
[1:55:22] <%a_goth_pancake> time to get wet DansGame
[1:55:23] <RogueMinja> Here comes a gate and an oof challenge.
[1:55:27] <%cobalt_phoenix_> later
[1:55:28] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> demon radiation
[1:55:31] <%Irridium> always punch the purple door. it doesn't do anything but it makes me feel better
[1:55:32] <%Javaa01> Rad has been a mechanic since 1993
[1:55:47] <prime_name> Whos ready for swims?!
[1:55:52] <+RealThiele> that old ywllowy filter for rad suit
[1:55:53] <@Solidus_113> IT'S THE MOST DOOM
[1:55:53] <DelgotHansto> NAH
[1:55:53] <pennykettle_> this is almost more of a half life thing
[1:55:56] <%cobalt_phoenix_> he's not wrong tho
[1:55:56] <RichochetForce> It's actually the most Doom thing.
[1:55:58] <somekindaspy> it isn't actually. it looks exactly like the original suit
[1:56:00] <Ozmodyas> VIDEO GAAAAMES
[1:56:00] <+greenfall> it was in doom 1 and 2
[1:56:00] <Solidnick18> nah shut up
[1:56:00] <somekindaspy> unfortunately
[1:56:01] <%DesertPenguin> WHAT ABOUT THE LORE LEVEL?!!?!?!?
[1:56:01] <+lion_oh> It's in a lot of the old dooms
[1:56:02] <unit24> these have always been here
[1:56:02] <BlackermanZX> Its the most doom
[1:56:02] <DelgotHansto> IT WAS DOOM 1
[1:56:03] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Yes, but it's been around forever.
[1:56:04] <@Solidus_113> IT'S LITERALLY FROM THE ORIGINAL GAMES
[1:56:04] <+RealThiele> the MOST DOOM
[1:56:04] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Pineapplemack Thanks for the gift sub!
[1:56:05] <Calek> the least doom thing despite being in the original doom
[1:56:05] <mesamus> ITS THE MOST DOOM
[1:56:07] <somekindaspy> it is, but it's lame
[1:56:08] <umbrellaswereawesome> At least the rad doesn't automatically wear off with time like in the OG Doom.
[1:56:08] <%GoldeNOVA> It's so doom tho
[1:56:08] <%a_goth_pancake> it's the most doom, shut up
[1:56:09] <alphalejandro> we need rad suits today
[1:56:09] <+paladinstarbuster> HE CANT EVEN FIT IN IT ANYMORE
[1:56:09] <%DesertPenguin> It's a throwback
[1:56:09] <$legacy0117> Also, another funny thing, they're society Neverrrr made gunpowder based weapons. They went straight to lasers, and Doomguy showed up with those weapons and had to learn to make the ammo for them. X3
[1:56:09] <+TheBigTaco> it a throwback woolie
[1:56:10] <%lewdskeletor13> It’s VERY doom
[1:56:10] <RichochetForce> It's 100% Doom.
[1:56:11] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[1:56:15] <Solidnick18> LUL
[1:56:16] <somekindaspy> you're not stupid, it totally is lame tho
[1:56:16] <%Javaa01> Stupid AND Ignorant
[1:56:16] <+RealThiele> LUL
[1:56:17] <+lion_oh> It's the least Doom 2016 thing in the world
[1:56:18] <Tha_Mik> You are wrong
[1:56:19] <raikagelord1> Well it is in original
[1:56:20] <RunningNGunning> LUL
[1:56:21] <%HostilePoundcakes> LUL
[1:56:22] <%DesertPenguin> It's classic doom
[1:56:22] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> It's just not fun
[1:56:22] <%Irridium> this is the MOST DOOM shit in the world! I marked the fuck out when I saw them LUL
[1:56:22] <BlackermanZX> LUL
[1:56:23] <xbb1024> gotta go, bye guys
[1:56:23] <%Asuterisuku> Rad Suits were literally a thing in DOOM 1
[1:56:24] <%GrassCannon> CRAZY TALK ACTIVATE
[1:56:24] <%ChoculaUltra> e x p o s e d
[1:56:25] <megamonmon123> Its fiiiii e
[1:56:25] <+RealThiele> ass immediate blown out
[1:56:26] <DatAsuna> rip
[1:56:27] <somekindaspy> nah im with ya
[1:56:28] <raikagelord1> But this is not fun
[1:56:29] <Tha_Mik> It be
[1:56:32] <%a_goth_pancake> woolieDATTEBAYO
[1:56:33] <%nawji> Secondary slaughtered live on stream
[1:56:33] <%lewdskeletor13> LUL
[1:56:36] <OtterSlinger> No swimming but there was a Radiation suit in Doom 1, timer based instead of bar based
[1:56:38] <dinnydanny777> Have to avoid the Demon radiation
[1:56:39] <%DesertPenguin> What about the level that was entirely lore? Was that more Doom than this?
[1:56:45] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> Balance has been restored to the stream.
[1:56:46] <+greenfall> it wasent that fun in the original too
[1:56:48] <somekindaspy> up
[1:56:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh no
[1:56:49] <DelgotHansto> HAIRIEST BALL LIVE ON STREAM
[1:56:49] <+paladinstarbuster> He cant even fit in it anymore guys
[1:56:51] <dinnydanny777> Hell is radioactive
[1:56:55] <somekindaspy> it was that hall but it
[1:56:59] <brachydios777> Crazy Talk is infecting others
[1:56:59] <Vohs_Bru> Doom stole it from Half life
[1:57:01] <%a_goth_pancake> the s u c c
[1:57:06] <raikagelord1> Maybe be a reference but universally hated because water levels suck.
[1:57:06] <somekindaspy> @Vohs_Bru nope
[1:57:08] <%FboyDaKing> Are ya feelin it now mr. krabs.
[1:57:11] <somekindaspy> doom came first
[1:57:12] <@Solidus_113> you must remember to look up
[1:57:13] <alphalejandro> Sonic water noises
[1:57:16] <somekindaspy> half-life 1 was made on the quake engine
[1:57:16] <derap41> This is the Doom Devs trying to be clever
[1:57:24] <megamonmon123> look for a shootable
[1:57:25] <%nawji> Doom 1 and 2 didn't have water levels, radiation was just a form of painfloor
[1:57:26] <grimshuck> Way to out yourself as a 2016'er
[1:57:35] <%nawji> Water levels are absolute trash
[1:57:36] <RichochetForce> @raikagelord1 Yup. Training the player with a certain level of mobility and responsiveness for 90% of a game, and then throwing that shit out + constant damage/drowning means water levels blow.
[1:57:38] <%a_goth_pancake> PogChamp lads I saw it
[1:57:45] <unit24> man this ambient music is great
[1:57:52] <Vohs_Bru> @somekindaspy you dont say :P
[1:57:53] <DatAsuna> i hope someone clipped that rad suit thing lol
[1:57:56] <spidervenomized> @nawji second
[1:58:05] <RichochetForce> @I love the hype shouting section
[1:58:10] <@Solidus_113> flush this toilet
[1:58:13] <Tha_Mik> You would think the devs know how bad are water levels
[1:58:23] <%DesertPenguin> Oh man you guys... I'm so high right now LUL
[1:58:34] <somekindaspy> iirc this slayer gate is extra tough
[1:58:35] <%FuqBoiSlim> Sewer levels 🤢
[1:58:37] <RichochetForce> @Tha_Mik Unfortunately, every dev thinks THEY'RE the ones that will finally make a good water level.
[1:58:39] <+RealThiele> @DesertPenguin right behind ya
[1:58:39] <DelgotHansto> Guys I think I might know what Kar en Tuk means,not certain though
[1:58:44] <somekindaspy> and yeah sewer levels are always lame
[1:58:49] <BlackermanZX> dig up
[1:58:50] <%Javaa01> And back to blindness
[1:58:53] <resloxxx> Woolie will figure it out
[1:58:56] <pennykettle_> rumor has it this level exists because the CEO's son played it and said "the game is boring there's no swimming" so they added it in the last week of dev
[1:58:56] <%a_goth_pancake> I missed a stream, is woolie classic guy?
[1:59:00] <%GoldeNOVA> Did Civvie mention it in his review?
[1:59:03] <snake_zen> GReen
[1:59:03] <Vohs_Bru> this whole part and the music is very HL2 though
[1:59:04] <%DesertPenguin> TADA
[1:59:06] <somekindaspy> i have never heard that
[1:59:08] <$legacy0117> It is also incredibly remarkable that Doomguy is so strong that he can swim underwater in that suit of armor.
[1:59:08] <Mrthefro> LUL

[1:59:30] <+YabbaTroll> no?
[1:59:38] <DatAsuna> no
[1:59:40] <+YabbaTroll> moving is looking tho
[1:59:41] <DelgotHansto> @a_goth_pancake He actualy got fucked by Bethesda trying to wear The 2016 suit
[1:59:42] <%FuqBoiSlim> WALKING ON SUNSHINE WOAH-OH

[1:59:50] <RichochetForce> @legacy0117 To be fair, he was fired like ordnance from a cannon and survived.
[1:59:50] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> SLAYER
[1:59:50] <%Javaa01> And now for the last gate
[1:59:53] <BlackermanZX> Its time doodNuts
[1:59:55] <+greenfall> this is a long complicated lvl lol

[2:07:37] <%Irridium> oh a real fun challenge coming up
[2:07:37] <megamonmon123> @revforever some people like it more than 2016, people like it less
[2:07:40] <DelgotHansto> The unmakyr is a single target king but lacks application most of the time
[2:07:40] <spidervenomized> BFG
[2:07:40] <%a_goth_pancake> that's the game, woolz. now you're getting it
[2:07:41] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> can u loop? LEARN THE L O O P
[2:07:43] <+boomer059> Here's the challenge of challenges in this room
[2:07:46] <pennykettle_> RichochetForce I suppose. Its not a huge spoiler to say the game ends hard
[2:07:46] <+MajiOMNI> Unmayker is fun with cheats, but ammo is too scarce
[2:07:58] <%DesertPenguin> Yea that's why it sucks, the ammo
[2:07:58] <somekindaspy> Man Reggie is the best
[2:08:05] <xxdj1173xx> good luck on next challenge
[2:08:07] <%a_goth_pancake> now laugh at this room like the joke it is
[2:08:08] <somekindaspy> Rumor has it that the DLC will have Unmaykr upgrades tho
[2:08:10] <+MajiOMNI> cool textures
[2:08:10] <@Solidus_113> busted textures EVERYWHERE
[2:08:10] <%DesertPenguin> For the scarcity of the ammo, the BFG is more bang for your buck
[2:08:12] <%Chatterbox1991> It's because it's Sorry not Soury ;)
[2:08:14] <Mrthefro> Textures
[2:08:14] <%Irridium> don't worry about that one
[2:08:20] <RichochetForce> @DesertPenguin Yeah, if it got a percentage of all ammo when picked up it'd have enough ammo to do its thing
[2:08:20] <%Double_Tap_That> Oh this next secret challenge is a biiiitch.
[2:08:21] <0rond> oh man the optional challenge in this room is a bitch
[2:08:21] <spidervenomized> the fuck was up with the snek hand
[2:08:21] <Solidnick18> bfg ammo
[2:08:23] <raikagelord1> Doomblade seems bad to me.
[2:08:25] <RichochetForce> It melts bosses while you have ammo.
[2:08:28] <%ekodrop> sohry

[2:08:50] <Woodstock_hobbs_> drunk style single finger. Dan
[2:08:53] <tidalwafer> I guess the graphic fucked up
[2:08:53] <$legacy0117> Hell Knight showed uppp
[2:08:55] <%DesertPenguin> Remember, the stream is in 720 so some textures might not show up properly
[2:08:58] <%a_goth_pancake> hello hell baron

[2:09:03] <somekindaspy> Barons are basically super hell knights

[2:14:46] <somekindaspy> never let a flameboi live for very long
[2:14:49] <angrygunny> live inside target
[2:14:49] <+braygrind> Try using your normal shotgun more tbh
[2:14:51] <somekindaspy> he makes your world a nightmare
[2:14:53] <peachy996> So how long does it take for Archie to summon the Three Amigos?
[2:14:59] <+braygrind> normal shotgun's sticky bombs are based asf
[2:15:01] <RichochetForce> @somekindaspy There's a certain weapon I reserve almost exclusively for them
[2:15:03] <Solidnick18> LUL
[2:15:03] <resloxxx> F
[2:15:04] <%a_goth_pancake> I need a shirt of the archvile summon pose

[2:15:09] <+paladinstarbuster> WOMBO COMBO
[2:15:11] <AppleBasket> damn dude, that guy was big
[2:15:11] <+greenfall> focus on the archy
[2:15:11] <megamonmon123> Damn it
[2:15:12] <Woodstock_hobbs_> rather stay in the mental hospital
[2:15:12] <%FuqBoiSlim> G
[2:15:15] <resloxxx> that was a good wombo
[2:15:16] <Tha_Mik> Big combo
[2:15:17] <%FuqBoiSlim> THAT AINT FALCO
[2:15:18] <megamonmon123> its alright woolie
[2:15:18] <spidervenomized> BFG the archvile
[2:15:19] <BlackermanZX> Sandwich'd
[2:15:19] <+segmentedfool> Trapped between a knight and a Spectre
[2:15:21] <Woodstock_hobbs_> all thought is conciousness
[2:15:21] <RichochetForce> @AppleBasket Archvile's are huge
[2:15:26] <Woodstock_hobbs_> incorrect as i correct you
[2:15:29] <EternallyHers> bfg for the Archville
[2:15:29] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:15:30] <$legacy0117> So, Archviles the worst. Literally.
[2:15:31] <%Javaa01> They're only dense because you're taking too long to kill the Archvile
[2:15:32] <@Solidus_113> And people wanted him to play on Ultra Violence
[2:15:32] <somekindaspy> fun fact: the archie lives through a single bfg shot.
[2:15:35] <+braygrind> Flame thrower and chuck a normal nade
[2:15:36] <BurdRightsActivist> @spidervenomized Bfg the ArchVILLE
[2:15:37] <+braygrind> at a bunch of welps
[2:15:37] <%Double_Tap_That> Premature BFGaculation
[2:15:37] <%Javaa01> His entire deal is to overwhelm you
[2:15:38] <alphalejandro> room is to smoll
[2:15:40] <+braygrind> and boom, all yer armor is back
[2:15:40] <Andrizzleton> can't stop moving
[2:15:43] <RichochetForce> @legacy0117 Yup, preserved from the original games.
[2:15:44] <umbrellaswereawesome> Basically, start looking for him as song as you kill that Baron.
[2:15:44] <%Javaa01> And you aren't killing him fast enough
[2:15:47] <%FuqBoiSlim> ULTAVIOLENCE LUL
[2:15:50] <%a_goth_pancake> kill the vile IMMEDIATELY @woolieversus
[2:15:52] <somekindaspy> i think he spawns in one of the corners
[2:15:55] <spidervenomized> @BurdRightsActivist yes thank you
[2:15:57] <grimshuck> Use the chain gun against the baron
[2:15:58] <megamonmon123> so list of fuckers who get it on sight: archvile, mauraders, whiplash, pain elementals, doom hunters
[2:16:04] <%FboyDaKing> Kill the marauder as soon as you can to avoid res pawning enemies.
[2:16:07] <$legacy0117> Neat, So Doomguy has fought them before.
[2:16:09] <DelgotHansto> @peachy996 You need absurdly bad luck and to kill all his other spawns, kinda disappointed there isn't a real 2 Marauder fight in Final Sin tho, would be insane
[2:16:10] <@Solidus_113> he always spawns on that teleporter corner
[2:16:10] <Woodstock_hobbs_> the forever philosophy is at the cornor stone of suicide
[2:16:22] <megamonmon123> is that accurate chat
[2:16:24] <+braygrind> Use remote det!
[2:16:30] <DelgotHansto> SO CLOSE TO THE SPINE RIP
[2:16:30] <+braygrind> @megamonmon123 acurate.
[2:16:36] <%a_goth_pancake> chop
[2:16:36] <%DesertPenguin> Abuse the warps
[2:16:36] <+braygrind> accurate*
[2:16:37] <%FboyDaKing> Not marauder archvile
[2:16:39] <negrosnake9185> Archy boi was hittin the gym between the games
[2:16:42] <RichochetForce> @megamonmon123 100% Correct. Those enemies are too dangerous to leave alone.
[2:16:45] <+braygrind> @FboyDaKing arcvile was first
[2:16:47] <%DesertPenguin> Always abuse the warps. It throws them off for just long enough to take a few more out
[2:16:54] <somekindaspy> ^
[2:16:57] <peachy996> Oh yeah make Final Sin even more of a gauntlet.
[2:17:04] <grimshuck> Chain gun
[2:17:07] <%DesertPenguin> Is it me or does the Tyrant look a lot smaller than his 2016 counterpart?
[2:17:07] <peachy996> that'd be cool
[2:17:08] <Woodstock_hobbs_> justin beiber is the anti christ. get your guns canada
[2:17:09] <+braygrind> CHAIN GUN SHIELD.
[2:17:11] <+braygrind> use it
[2:17:15] <JetpackMcQuack> He's in a trance
[2:17:16] <somekindaspy> Archviles are always #1 priority, tho. If you leave them alive too long they start spawning marauders
[2:17:22] <+braygrind> 5 second cooldown, blocks a shit load of damage
[2:17:24] <0rond> do corner
[2:17:25] <RichochetForce> @DesertPenguin Apparently these are bootleg offbrand versions of the Cyberdemon
[2:17:32] <%FuqBoiSlim> REMEMBER YOUR SCHMOVEMENT WOOLIE
[2:17:33] <+braygrind> chain gun shield is amazingly good, even in battlemode agienst top tier demon mains
[2:17:35] <%FboyDaKing> @somekindaspy exactly. Listen to this man.
[2:17:39] <0rond> it doesn't count as beating it unless you do corner
[2:17:43] <RichochetForce> The one 2016 was apparently the top dog of the type.
[2:17:46] <+braygrind> ...
[2:17:47] <somekindaspy> man go find that archie
[2:17:51] <somekindaspy> it's in a corner
[2:17:51] <Woodstock_hobbs_> i hope i can get laid in the next trillion years
[2:17:54] <%a_goth_pancake> get fucked
[2:17:55] <RogueMinja> Now find that vile and BFG him in the face.
[2:17:56] <+braygrind> Don't shoot the guys who are half-on fire, kill the summoner
[2:18:00] <somekindaspy> ahhh damn
[2:18:01] <%DesertPenguin> They figured if Doomguy gets a cool wrist blade then demons should too. Hell Knights have a sword variant too
[2:18:01] <%SuperKirby24> F

[2:18:04] <%HostilePoundcakes> F
[2:18:08] <+braygrind> F
[2:18:08] <@Solidus_113> Archvile sets you on fire from anywhere @WoolieVersus
[2:18:08] <RichochetForce> Yipes, backed up into a Cyber Mancubus
[2:18:11] <spidervenomized> F
[2:18:12] <%DesertPenguin> Kill the summoner first no matter what
[2:18:13] <KaiserMario> @WoolieVersus Archvile spawns once you kill the Baron
[2:18:18] <+braygrind> Blood punch cyber manc
[2:18:19] <%DesertPenguin> It doesn't get any easier
[2:18:20] <%Javaa01> Enemies that are in that orange state do not exist yet
[2:18:21] <spidervenomized> Cyber mancubus
[2:18:22] <brachydios777> NotLikeThis
[2:18:23] <BlackermanZX> Kill the archvile immediately
[2:18:23] <0rond> orange boys are not spawned yet
[2:18:24] <%Javaa01> Do not shoot them
[2:18:24] <%DesertPenguin> Archvile
[2:18:27] <RichochetForce> Archvile
[2:18:27] <%DesertPenguin> Archie McVille
[2:18:28] <BurdRightsActivist> ARCH VILLE
[2:18:28] <Arrowheart17> Archville before everything else
[2:18:28] <LeviathanNexus> Flame Boy LUL
[2:18:30] <+segmentedfool> I forgot how crazy the summoners went with heavies and super heavies
[2:18:30] <%Irridium> Archvile
[2:18:31] <+braygrind> hey
[2:18:33] <%Javaa01> Barons ain't shit
[2:18:35] <%nawji> Baron of Hell
[2:18:35] <+MajiOMNI> Baron of Hell
[2:18:36] <%FboyDaKing> Archvile must die
[2:18:37] <peachy996> Archvile FUCKS
[2:18:38] <resloxxx> @WoolieVersus Dont forget your new shield upgrade!
[2:18:39] <%a_goth_pancake> viles in the corner after you kill the baron
[2:18:39] <+MajiOMNI> use minigun
[2:18:39] <%DesertPenguin> Archvile. Just hit him with a fucking BFG shot and you're done
[2:18:41] <+braygrind> Barons aren't scary
[2:18:42] <%FboyDaKing> Baron of hell
[2:18:43] <megamonmon123> woolie seems to have a problem with trying to chainsaw everything
[2:18:43] <RichochetForce> Archvile is #1 evil shithead
[2:18:43] <%DesertPenguin> Archvile
[2:18:45] <@Solidus_113> Baron
[2:18:46] <+Strigiform> marauder
[2:18:47] <resloxxx> Baron
[2:18:47] <LeviathanNexus> Archvile
[2:18:48] <%Javaa01> You can kite em all day long
[2:18:49] <megamonmon123> baron of hell
[2:18:49] <+braygrind> archvile is a mother fucker
[2:18:49] <@Solidus_113> Baron of Hell
[2:18:50] <0rond> he is talking about hell barones
[2:18:52] <%DesertPenguin> YES
[2:18:52] <+braygrind> marauder is even worst
[2:18:53] <+greenfall> Baron
[2:18:53] <RogueMinja> Barons aren't too bad.
[2:18:54] <Solidnick18> the blade ones
[2:18:54] <Woodstock_hobbs_> learned
[2:18:54] <%Irridium> Archvile or Baron are the two big fuck demons
[2:18:55] <umbrellaswereawesome> Baron of Hell.
[2:18:56] <+braygrind> but hell barons aren't bad.
[2:18:57] <RunningNGunning> Archvile have always been fucks since day 1
[2:18:57] <+green715> Its the Baron
[2:18:57] <peachy996> You mean Barons?
[2:18:57] <BlackermanZX> baron of hell
[2:18:59] <%JustYudha> Fuck demon lol
[2:18:59] <%Javaa01> Not necessarily
[2:19:01] <%a_goth_pancake> baron of hell is what you're looking for
[2:19:02] <somekindaspy> BFG will damage it severely, not kill
[2:19:04] <%DesertPenguin> Archvile loves BFG. You should show it to him
[2:19:05] <RichochetForce> BFGs don't instantly kill super heavies.
[2:19:05] <megamonmon123> no baron
[2:19:10] <+braygrind> bfg is not that good ;-;
[2:19:11] <raikagelord1> Baron
[2:19:12] <EternallyHers> use bfg for the summoner
[2:19:13] <RichochetForce> But it does heavily damage them
[2:19:13] <%Javaa01> From full health, you need a long range direct hit for an instant kill
[2:19:13] <snake_zen> Baron of hell woolie
[2:19:14] <Klarrann3> Chaingun is the big guy's weakness
[2:19:19] <megamonmon123> chaingun
[2:19:21] <raikagelord1> Chain gun
[2:19:22] <somekindaspy> bfg is amazing, but you gotta give it a chance to fly
[2:19:22] <@Solidus_113> It's Baron of Hell
[2:19:24] <%HostilePoundcakes> BFG will only stun Barons
[2:19:24] <+paladinstarbuster> Barons can be taken out with a few FULLdestroyer blades
[2:19:25] <BlackermanZX> not the tyrant
[2:19:25] <resloxxx> Baron
[2:19:25] <somekindaspy> it's baron of hell
[2:19:26] <candidateplays> Woolie, please use a word to describe them other than "big" or "hard"
[2:19:27] <RichochetForce> Baron of Hell
[2:19:28] <%DesertPenguin> Yes
[2:19:28] <+braygrind> It's 'Baron of hell"
[2:19:28] <megamonmon123> chaingun is his weakness
[2:19:28] <RogueMinja> Chaingun it.
[2:19:30] <Solidnick18> it's the baron
[2:19:32] <+braygrind> CHAINGUN SHIELD!!!
[2:19:32] <%FboyDaKing> He’ll figure it out one day.
[2:19:33] <spidervenomized> Baron of hell
[2:19:33] <%DesertPenguin> Baron is the tougher version
[2:19:33] <Klarrann3> Chaingun
[2:19:34] <+braygrind> use the shield
[2:19:37] <Arrowheart17> Baron
[2:19:37] <Solidnick18> the tyrant is the tall guy
[2:19:39] <Woodstock_hobbs_> sppon
[2:19:40] <megamonmon123> baron of hell
[2:19:41] <grimshuck> Use the mobile turret on the baron
[2:19:42] <%a_goth_pancake> @woolieversus baron
[2:19:44] <+greenfall> use chaingun
[2:19:45] <DelgotHansto> fuccboi you say?
[2:19:47] <+braygrind> Mobile turret is bad!
[2:19:47] <somekindaspy> ok i think the archie spawns in the corner where the warp is.
[2:19:48] <%DesertPenguin> CHaingun Shield dude
[2:19:51] <somekindaspy> when you first enter the room
[2:19:51] <+braygrind> mobile turret wastes so much ammo
[2:19:55] <+braygrind> chaingun shieldi s SO DAMN GOOD.
[2:19:56] <megamonmon123> chain gun
[2:19:58] <peachy996> Baron of Hell is the guy on fire
[2:20:00] <0rond> archie doesn't spawn instantly
[2:20:01] <%mitchteck> Use chaingun
[2:20:01] <%FboyDaKing> Wait til you fight tyrant.
[2:20:06] <somekindaspy> he has
[2:20:07] <Woodstock_hobbs_> yeah
[2:20:12] <somekindaspy> Tyrants aren't really that bad
[2:20:23] <somekindaspy> Barons will chase you down. they're like super hell knights on crack
[2:20:24] <0rond> "woolie you have to hit them"
[2:20:24] <grimshuck> @braygrind it's not wasted if he fucking dead
[2:20:26] <%DesertPenguin> Everywhere you turn there's a demon
[2:20:28] <%a_goth_pancake> chumps, just like cyber in doom 1
[2:20:29] <0rond> i'm not trying to be a shit here
[2:20:36] <0rond> ~speed~
[2:20:38] <+braygrind> @grimshuck chaingun shield fixed the whole "fucking dead" part
[2:20:42] <+braygrind> shield just blocks damage
[2:20:45] <RichochetForce> Yup, Tyrants are nowhere near the most dangerous in the game
[2:20:47] <%DesertPenguin> Redirect everyone to the big area and use the BFG to kill them all
[2:20:52] <+braygrind> ^^^
[2:20:57] <+braygrind> BFG does more damage the further it flies tho right?
[2:20:59] <spidervenomized> why is he always try to chainsaw hevys
[2:21:00] <somekindaspy> do whatever you have to do to cheese these mofos. it's always encouraged
[2:21:02] <0rond> tyrants are only a problem when there are 2 of them
[2:21:03] <%DesertPenguin> You can't stnad still dude
[2:21:05] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> tyrants are dangerous as long as they can aim at you
[2:21:06] <0rond> archies are just fucks
[2:21:08] <%DesertPenguin> Standing still is apathy which is death
[2:21:11] <somekindaspy> bfg this fool
[2:21:13] <%FboyDaKing> @somekindaspy considering I played the game and the memories are starting to come back to me. Yeah your right they were more easier.
[2:21:14] <+braygrind> Lock on is generally bad
[2:21:15] <Klarrann3> Chaingun the big guy
[2:21:18] <%nawji> god I wish he would just use the regular ballista, the blade is terrible
[2:21:22] <%DesertPenguin> CHaingun Shield or just BFG already
[2:21:27] <+braygrind> @nawji right?
[2:21:29] <RichochetForce> @NotSoAccurateNo1 And if you're constantly moving, they cant' really hit you.
[2:21:30] <+braygrind> regular balista is so good
[2:21:31] <%a_goth_pancake> your chaingun is more effective on the baron, stunlocks his dumb ass
[2:21:39] <@Solidus_113> clean
[2:21:39] <somekindaspy> tyrants are just giant bullet sponges, they're chumps. barons chase you down like mad dogs. archviles are super bastards.
[2:21:41] <%DesertPenguin> That's when you need the shield
[2:21:44] <+braygrind> Shit, in BATTLEMODE, the strat is Balista/PB for the most part
[2:21:45] <RichochetForce> Things like Prowlers, Whiplashes can stay on your ass hard
[2:21:46] <somekindaspy> OK ITS IN THE CORNER
[2:21:47] <+YabbaTroll> yeyeyeye
[2:21:48] <%FboyDaKing> Guns of chain.
[2:21:50] <+mckraven> weakness lots of bullets

[2:24:53] <spidervenomized> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[2:24:53] <RichochetForce> You could HEAR the PTSD in Woolie's voice.
[2:24:55] <%JustYudha> This was ROUGH BRO
[2:24:58] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @braygrind
[2:24:58] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[2:25:03] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus nobody will call you out for skipping this challenge
[2:25:04] <TomosukeUsagi> Ah yes, DEJA VU
[2:25:04] <zipfile777> its 4 pm
[2:25:04] <%DesertPenguin> I had to increase my sensitivity to follow this guy
[2:25:08] <peachy996> Get Gud in half a minute
[2:25:10] <+braygrind> You gotta swap to balista after you stun him!
[2:25:10] <somekindaspy> Agreed with solidus
[2:25:10] <%mitchteck> Get fucked
[2:25:11] <%Pineapplemack> I love my gamer dads playing DOOM
[2:25:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> 1
[2:25:13] <megamonmon123> splash damage
[2:25:15] <RichochetForce> @Solidus_113 Exactly
[2:25:16] <+mckraven> you really gotta do the super shot to ballista thing
[2:25:17] <%DesertPenguin> shotgun/ballista
[2:25:18] <%Irridium> this one's a fuck
[2:25:18] <%a_goth_pancake> rip
[2:25:20] <%nawji> fuck skipping, this is where he's gonna finally learn how to kill one of these guys
[2:25:21] <KaiserMario> DO IT GIT GUD
[2:25:21] <%Javaa01> Learn to damage combo
[2:25:22] <0rond> BFG it
[2:25:23] <Monkeyweed21> This is prolly the hardest challenge in the game
[2:25:23] <+braygrind> SSG/Balista!
[2:25:23] <megamonmon123> If you spam sticky grenades it melts him
[2:25:24] <+greenfall> the git gud chalange
[2:25:24] <Klarrann3> @WoolieVersus the easiest way to do this is to stagger with supershotgun and IMMEDIATELY shoot it with a regular ballista
[2:25:24] <%Javaa01> Or die
[2:25:24] <somekindaspy> man if you wanna skip this one, we don't care
[2:25:24] <%DesertPenguin> Do the thing we keep telling you about
[2:25:25] <%HostilePoundcakes> Get good right now Kappa
[2:25:25] <%FboyDaKing> Uh oh.
[2:25:25] <Solidnick18> bfg if you do it without him seeing you
[2:25:26] <RogueMinja> Super shottie to ballista.
[2:25:27] <BlackermanZX> You gotta learn the strat
[2:25:28] <RichochetForce> Yeah, Quick Swap Ballista/SSG is almost mandatory
[2:25:30] <+mckraven> that's the only way i could beat it
[2:25:30] <+braygrind> SSG stun, balista
[2:25:30] <KaiserMario> GIT GUD SCRUB
[2:25:31] <%a_goth_pancake> seriously, this one is a come back at the end of the level
[2:25:32] <RogueMinja> That's the fastest way.
[2:25:33] <+Mecha_G> there are so manty ways to cheese Marauder
[2:25:33] <%nawji> this is like being forced to learn to parry in MGRR
[2:25:34] <penitentpentwitch> Not on screen
[2:25:35] <peachy996> You WILL learn how to fight the Marauder in this level
[2:25:37] <mdkcde> send him the SuniiLegend
[2:25:38] <megamonmon123> spamming sticky grenades at his feet kills him
[2:25:38] <RichochetForce> That or remote detonate rockets + nades
[2:25:41] <%DesertPenguin> Gotta do the quickswap with super shotgun/ballista
[2:25:41] <0rond> BFG but you can't aim at him
[2:25:42] <+skylerpilot> anyone teach Woolie the shot swap tech?
[2:25:43] <mdkcde> he must learn from the master
[2:25:44] <%SuperKirby24> yeah, you can do it offscreen if you want, this ones a fuck
[2:25:45] <brachydios777> NotLikeThis
[2:25:46] <$BrazenMask> its very doable but you gotta get your shots in as efficiently as possible
[2:25:49] <0rond> you can do it without quick swap
[2:25:51] <0rond> I did it
[2:25:53] <0rond> but it's hard
[2:25:55] <%FboyDaKing> SShotgun/ballista/sshotgun
[2:25:58] <megamonmon123> @woolieversus you can cheese the maurader with sticky grenades near his feet
[2:25:59] <+SinisterBroccoli> This one was a toughy
[2:26:01] <heart_ablaze> no one will be upset if you skip this one woolie. this ones a bitch and a half
[2:26:02] <penitentpentwitch> Not with that ammo count
[2:26:03] <somekindaspy> Ok ok, so here's a tip: marauders focus down HARD on grenades. shoot a grenade over his shoulder and he will lock on to it
[2:26:05] <+braygrind> SSG then balista...
[2:26:05] <Andrizzleton> the ol GSP line
[2:26:06] <%Asuterisuku> You can cheese this one by making him despawn.
[2:26:10] <DelgotHansto> Grenades help but the quick swap will do it fucking rapid if you get HIM in the DOOM SLAYER LOOP
[2:26:10] <grimshuck> ssg>ballista>ssg
[2:26:15] <umbrellaswereawesome> I'd say stun with SS then hit with BFG, but that requires the quick switch tech.
[2:26:18] <+braygrind> Quick swap makes EVERYTHING easy.
[2:26:20] <%DesertPenguin> I got chills. They're multiplyin'
[2:26:22] <+Mecha_G> or fire a bfg over his head, or remote detomate rockets
[2:26:24] <+braygrind> litterly baron of hell takes like 5 seconds with quick swapping
[2:26:36] <+braygrind> the second you learn how to quick swap this game becomes so easy

[2:35:03] <RichochetForce> @grimshuck Yeah, her motivations actually make sense. She literally doesn't want to go through the transfiguration and lose all the intellect and wisdom they have.

[2:35:34] <RichochetForce> @somekindaspy The ones with the ring on their back, yes. Samur had a will of his own, as we clearly saw. He did something expressly against her wishes. And he was her Chancellor.

[2:40:37] <%Double_Tap_That> Until it is done, but some need to be done before others.
[2:40:50] <%Asuterisuku> Chaingun is strong against the Hellknight line, including Dread Knights and Barons.

[2:43:12] <somekindaspy> Taras Nabad: the New York City of the Argenta. The fuck world.

[2:44:45] <RichochetForce> @peachy996 I noticed that
[2:44:51] <peachy996> I didn't notice that detail before
[2:44:51] <RichochetForce> I'll stay silent until that time comes
[2:44:58] <peachy996> neat
[2:45:01] <RichochetForce> Nice detail

[2:45:08] <%HostilePoundcakes> LUL
[2:45:12] <%Javaa01> You're double jumping way too late
[2:45:12] <arkv01> you can only rip and tear effectively once you've purged deez nuts
[2:45:14] <somekindaspy> aim higher
[2:45:14] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> Hey, drugs ruin my high! I'm too cool to drink and smoke!
[2:45:15] <spidervenomized> BUGTHESDA
[2:45:20] <brachydios777> @peachy996 Didn’t notice it too
[2:45:26] <%a_goth_pancake> woolie why
[2:45:38] <alphalejandro> When the Pinkys attack
[2:45:38] <%DesertPenguin> BLOOD PUNCH
[2:45:45] <+YabbaTroll> dude its poor kidneys
[2:45:45] <%Double_Tap_That> That glory kill is mean
[2:45:51] <somekindaspy> Blood Punch insta-kills pinkies
[2:45:55] <%DesertPenguin> Blood punch kills pinky in one hit
[2:45:58] <spidervenomized> it becuse it sound like a tortured pig
[2:46:04] <%DesertPenguin> And it's a prison shank lol
[2:46:08] <%Double_Tap_That> It's not even that gory, just visceral
[2:46:10] <somekindaspy> also he's basically shanking a demonic animal in the back
[2:46:10] <$legacy0117> PAIN BOI IN THE BACK.
[2:46:34] <RichochetForce> I remember the Pinky entry from before
[2:46:36] <%DesertPenguin> I wonder how they made the SFX for Pinky. It probably is some pig audio that's been horribly manipulated lol
[2:46:42] <RichochetForce> They're just a low tier snack food in Hell.
[2:46:50] <%a_goth_pancake> pat pat, gooboi
[2:46:54] <somekindaspy> Prowlers are basically black widow imps
[2:47:05] <Crippl3> that's one of my favorite glory kills, just rip the chest open
[2:47:14] <%DesertPenguin> Oh wow, so much more
[2:47:28] <somekindaspy> we're actually kinda close to the end of the level. in the latter third-ish.
[2:47:36] <DelgotHansto> @somekindaspy You mean NightCrawler or am I not getting something
[2:47:44] <somekindaspy> I meant like the spider
[2:47:44] <KaiserMario> Just 2 more hours and you can get the Unmaykr
[2:47:46] <peachy996> I would not be surprised if Taras Nabad was its own stream
[2:47:48] <%DesertPenguin> When I saw the map it felt like there's a decent amount. Not in sheer volume but gameplay gonna take awhile
[2:47:48] <%a_goth_pancake> ugh, this part
[2:47:55] <RichochetForce> @peachy996 There's a good chance.
[2:47:56] <alphalejandro> "no, im pure"
[2:47:56] <Solidnick18> sip of the drugs
[2:47:58] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> RIP AND TEAR, UNTIL IT'S DONE
[2:48:01] <DelgotHansto> Oh big doo doo fart me
[2:48:01] <%DesertPenguin> Oh yea, we're gonna totally be done when this mission ends. I feel it
[2:48:02] <+paladinstarbuster> Sad Kar en Tuk

[2:51:55] <@Solidus_113> Apathy is death?
[2:51:58] <%DesertPenguin> Now they have meaning
[2:52:04] <+paladinstarbuster> Rely of your fists GODS WILL NEVER HELP YOU
[2:52:08] <%DesertPenguin> nope
[2:52:09] <RichochetForce> No
[2:52:10] <somekindaspy> nope
[2:52:10] <%a_goth_pancake> be like a Klingon; kill your gods.
[2:52:10] <+paladinstarbuster> NOPE
[2:52:11] <Solidnick18> no
[2:52:11] <alphalejandro> Unmake the Makyr
[2:52:12] <%Javaa01> They know about hell
[2:52:13] <%HostilePoundcakes> nope
[2:52:13] <RichochetForce> Humanity is completely in the dark.
[2:52:13] <spidervenomized> no
[2:52:14] <%DesertPenguin> "Hell" no
[2:52:15] <Crippl3> Hayden knows and that's it
[2:52:16] <+YabbaTroll> they dont know shit
[2:52:16] <megamonmon123> NAW
[2:52:20] <%tearfuldevil> @somekindaspy instead, the canon doomguy is a demon mulching nunchuck swinging sword forging skateboard riding mixtape mixing killshot comp making vinyl listening gun nut virgin
[2:52:23] <%lewdskeletor13> No
[2:52:23] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> nope
[2:52:23] <peachy996> Sam does
[2:52:25] <+YabbaTroll> just the stuff sam found
[2:52:25] <raikagelord1> Nope
[2:52:27] <KnivesEve> only hayden
[2:52:29] <DelgotHansto> This is out in a far away galaxy
[2:52:29] <%Irridium> nope. well, except maybe Sam. And Olivia
[2:52:31] <somekindaspy> @tearfuldevil kinda lol
[2:52:32] <$legacy0117> HHHMMM
[2:52:32] <Solidnick18> they know that demons kill them
[2:52:35] <%tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus sam studied shit, and some uac people might have
[2:52:35] <%Irridium> but Olivia is gone
[2:52:35] <brachydios777> @spatulord hope you’re doing good then
[2:52:36] <+skylerpilot> humans know nothing
[2:52:37] <RichochetForce> The only one that knows is Sam, and he apparently hasn't shared this knowledge.
[2:52:38] <somekindaspy> @Irridium i mean not sam
[2:52:40] <%DesertPenguin> Humans thing demons are actually from Hell when they're actually just creatures from another dimension that looks very much like what they believed Hell would be. It just happens to match up
[2:52:42] <somekindaspy> he doesn't count
[2:52:45] <%lewdskeletor13> UAC on Mars did
[2:52:48] <raikagelord1> Only what Sam has shared
[2:52:50] <%DesertPenguin> The statues
[2:52:50] <%HostilePoundcakes> hmmmmmmm
[2:52:53] <RichochetForce> Yup
[2:52:55] <+Spatulord> @brachydios777 I am, thanks
[2:52:56] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Hmmmmmmmmm
[2:52:56] <%lewdskeletor13> HMMMMM
[2:52:58] <%Asuterisuku> Hmmmmmm
[2:53:00] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> hmm
[2:53:00] <Tha_Mik> Da boys
[2:53:00] <%a_goth_pancake> statue
[2:53:01] <pennykettle_> The UAC knew, they recovered all that. they recovered the doomguy coffin
[2:53:02] <anita_dickin> hmmmmm
[2:53:03] <%DesertPenguin> Didn't we see them in holographic form when in the hell levels?
[2:53:07] <resloxxx> tomatoMMM tomatoMMM tomatoMMM
[2:53:10] <brachydios777> That’s right
[2:53:13] <@Solidus_113> also tablets with the crucible
[2:53:14] <%SuperKirby24> hmmmmmmm
[2:53:14] <%a_goth_pancake> squad
[2:53:16] <pennykettle_> UAC and humans are different. its a private company that found them
[2:53:21] <%DesertPenguin> Sounds like Sam is more than he seems?
[2:53:23] <+YabbaTroll> ye we saw them as holo's
[2:53:24] <Crippl3> The UAC found Doom Slayer, they knew.
[2:53:26] <%lewdskeletor13> Kinda weird that all the guards on Mars had PRAETOR TOKENS in them
[2:53:27] <somekindaspy> PogChamp
[2:53:28] <RichochetForce> Yeah, UAC never made that information public.
[2:53:28] <RogueMinja> He took them.
[2:53:32] <%FuqBoiSlim> monkaS
[2:53:33] <RogueMinja> ^
[2:53:35] <megamonmon123> woolie isnt wrong
[2:53:46] <megamonmon123> just it isnt wildly known
[2:53:47] <somekindaspy> @lewdskeletor13 the idea was that you were taking their "tech" and upgrading your suit
[2:53:51] <somekindaspy> oh wait wait
[2:53:51] <+CryptusMaximus> Well to be fair he could have found those in Hell in the absorbed Argent D'nur.....not that there's no merit to your theory
[2:53:52] <%omenzazu> Sam made alot of stuff private
[2:53:53] <Solidnick18> lol
[2:53:59] <%omenzazu> even from the UAC
[2:54:11] <youthgonewild77> woolie will figure it out SeemsGood
[2:54:13] <%a_goth_pancake> me too sbfpLiam
[2:54:16] <RichochetForce> @omenzazu That's how he was able to grab Doomguy's sarcophagus
[2:54:26] <RichochetForce> He hid his search for it from Olivia
[2:54:28] <+RealThiele> "We investigated ourselves, and found no wrong doing."
[2:54:39] <RichochetForce> There was a hologram cutscene where they had an argument about it.
[2:54:39] <%Asuterisuku> Samurl Hayden is not the villain in this story.
[2:54:40] <$legacy0117> I was jk. But seriously, this biblical Demons. For real.
[2:54:41] <LeviathanNexus> "life anew" eh?
[2:54:44] <brachydios777> Did he view the civil war image?
[2:54:53] <%lewdskeletor13> ETERNAL
[2:54:56] <somekindaspy> @legacy0117 not quite
[2:55:00] <%Javaa01> Blathers?
[2:55:09] <somekindaspy> Blathers was a night sentinel confirmed
[2:55:11] <megamonmon123> blooders
[2:55:20] <%DesertPenguin> @Asuterisuku Sounds familiar lol
[2:55:44] <$legacy0117> These demons just have cybernetics, only difference.
[2:56:02] <RichochetForce> RIP Wraiths
[2:56:02] <DelgotHansto> Pretty sure this entry is longer than I Have No Mouth
[2:56:03] <%lewdskeletor13> Hmmm
[2:56:08] <RichochetForce> Remember what happened to them in 2016?
[2:56:14] <%omenzazu> @richochetforce good too that he did
[2:56:18] <%DesertPenguin> Marauder in the background
[2:56:19] <somekindaspy> RIP the Wraiths
[2:56:25] <Gutsandlove> LOOK UP
[2:56:26] <somekindaspy> they were innocent
[2:56:31] <%a_goth_pancake> look at that cool ass sentinel at the top
[2:56:33] <brachydios777> The raddest image
[2:56:36] <%lewdskeletor13> Looking at Doomguy jumping in thair
[2:56:36] <RichochetForce> @omenzazu Yeah, Sam knew exactly who he was looking for.
[2:56:37] <$legacy0117> Also Pentagrams and all those everywhere?
[2:56:37] <+greenfall> doomguy in the back
[2:56:45] <somekindaspy> They are still angels, though. Again, just sci-fi angels.
[2:56:45] <resloxxx> correct
[2:56:51] <brachydios777> It is a race
[2:56:54] <%lewdskeletor13> They’re Eldritch angles

[2:58:17] <%arcielardor> devil moths
[2:58:20] <somekindaspy> The problem is that heaven didn't have to be like this. IT was just a greedy Khan who did it.

[2:59:16] <brachydios777> T POSE!
[2:59:17] <%SuperKirby24> pat stole his AC LUL
[2:59:17] <somekindaspy> @grimshuck yeah it's something not a lot of people realize or consider, but Urdak and the Maykrs weren't always like this. It was just this khan being a twat
[2:59:19] <oOZtkOo> pat stole woolies ac's energy to fix his
[2:59:20] <arkv01> pat that fuckin AC dickass
[2:59:21] <%Asuterisuku> I'm not built for 30' weather though.
[2:59:24] <Monkeyweed21> AC is for the weak, like children
[2:59:25] <megamonmon123> nude doom steam
[2:59:25] <$legacy0117> Hiiiii Reggie. ^^
[2:59:26] <%arcielardor> Feeling that preview of hell there, Woolie?
[2:59:38] <CoffeeSlice> ARGENT COOLING
[2:59:41] <DeathByPoke7> Argent Cooling
[2:59:45] <RichochetForce> See, Pat destroyed the ACs for the BETTERMENT of Castle Superbeast.
[2:59:46] <dinnydanny777> AC is Argent energy
[2:59:47] <TheAmazingClaytor> Woolie's AC is out of ARGENT
[2:59:51] <Bodregg> @somekindaspy yes, but to call her greedy is a bit disingenuous remember the spoiler codices from you-know-where later in the game?
[2:59:51] <%DesertPenguin> Hi Reggie! You're used to it more
[2:59:54] <%nawji> reggie is a true man
[2:59:57] <+CFIC843z> Hi this is my first live livestream
[2:59:57] <DelgotHansto> No one has an AC in Ireland
[2:59:58] <+arancet> is it though
[3:00:00] <%DesertPenguin> Or you could just stay inside with AC and never go anywhere
[3:00:01] <Damie904> Yo Reggie, can you get Woolie to look up UMVC3: EX. It's a really cool Marvel mod.
[3:00:06] <%a_goth_pancake> gotta say, very uncomfortable with the strong satanic energy coming off of this room rn, it's spoopy sbfpRage
[3:00:12] <somekindaspy> @Bodregg I'm aware. But again, it's all her fault anyway. She wanted to rule forever.
[3:00:15] <+MakotoPB> humidity is the part I hate more. I don't mind being warm, but I mind sweating when I'm just trying to sit here
[3:00:17] <arkv01> reggie costco dot ca is selling a portable AC for 399, use those dokapon bucks fam
[3:00:17] <%nawji> nothing is more satisfying than having your friends come over and complain about the heat and you're just like I LIVE LIKE THIS
[3:00:17] <%tearfuldevil> hey, ladies, wanna ride in my mercedes
[3:00:19] <Damie904> Yep

[3:01:27] <%tearfuldevil> @eljuanito1989 woolie isn't really an anime channel
[3:01:40] <%FuqBoiSlim> KappaRoss
[3:01:46] <%Asuterisuku> @eljuanito1989 Start at Part 1 and just keep going.

[3:02:35] <spidervenomized> LUL
[3:02:42] <brachydios777> @eljuanito1989 Part 1 is the way to start
[3:02:44] <%a_goth_pancake> about 75%
[3:02:45] <+rytyoung> near the end of the level
[3:02:46] <%DesertPenguin> Sometimes it's a proper actor
[3:02:50] <%DesertPenguin> They gave a shit
[3:02:50] <%lewdskeletor13> Super theater actor
[3:02:52] <%tearfuldevil> @Bodregg he jsut picke dup the sword hilt
[3:03:00] <eljuanito1989> people say part 1 is the worst?
[3:03:05] <%DesertPenguin> Yea he's not a VA
[3:03:08] <%DesertPenguin> He's just a damn good actor
[3:03:09] <Mrthefro> Part 1 Start
[3:03:10] <prime_name> Celeb Actors are the easiest to spot
[3:03:10] <RichochetForce> Yes, he's an actor
[3:03:12] <%DesertPenguin> Yea
[3:03:12] <+rytyoung> @eljuanito1989 it's still good
[3:03:16] <somekindaspy> @Bodregg hes in the last third basically
[3:03:16] <Bodregg> ah, so he's met archie and seen the machine cutscene
[3:03:18] <+demegodz> Actor man
[3:03:19] <RichochetForce> Tommie Earl Jenkins is a really good actor
[3:03:22] <ManlyMcBeefington> Tony Earl Jennkis was on Boardway CATZ
[3:03:22] <%DesertPenguin> Tommy Earl "Leeroy" Jenkins
[3:03:22] <brachydios777> @eljuanito1989 It’s not
[3:03:25] <%Irridium> he's an actor actor
[3:03:25] <%lewdskeletor13> He’s a movie actor right?
[3:03:26] <DAYMAN0_0> hes a director
[3:03:29] <+Mecha_G> which Elder Scrolls had an outtake left in for an NPC?
[3:03:32] <eljuanito1989> Die Hard Man is the MVP
[3:03:34] <%DesertPenguin> He made me cry
[3:03:34] <+maenos2> i mean shocker that most of death stranding is made up of actors given kojima's hard on for hollywood there
[3:03:35] <dinnydanny777> I think a lot of the actors in 2001 A Space Oddysey were just actors from local theatres
[3:03:38] <arkv01> yeah diehardman had the chops
[3:03:46] <%a_goth_pancake> he's become VERY intimately familiar with Archie
[3:03:48] <somekindaspy> oh i saw that comment it was so weird
[3:03:55] <%FuqBoiSlim> arent most of the Dark Souls VAs from theater too?
[3:04:01] <+rytyoung> soooo good, gave him mad props on FB and he replied
[3:04:01] <VJdarkworld> manalso
[3:04:01] <%DesertPenguin> Probably
[3:04:02] <%tearfuldevil> @eljuanito1989 yes, and it really does IMO, but there's stuff in part 2 and 3 that don't make sense without watching it
[3:04:06] <Bodregg> how hard did the archie fuck with woolie?
[3:04:07] <%DesertPenguin> Dark Souls VAs are incredible
[3:04:09] <%Skullgod> hey
[3:04:13] <+rytyoung> It was the Maurader he was referring to
[3:04:18] <somekindaspy> @Bodregg it was so hard
[3:04:24] <%Asuterisuku> Guillermo del Toro's face as the model though.
[3:04:24] <Bodregg> how many lives
[3:04:28] <RichochetForce> I know Gideon Emery was a stage actor before doing FFXII.
[3:04:29] <arkv01> mothman? what are you doing in woolie's house??
[3:04:32] <%a_goth_pancake> it was more the baron tbh
[3:04:34] <eljuanito1989> I only saw episode 1 with the "it was me Dio" meme
[3:04:36] <%tearfuldevil> @eljuanito1989 course, imo jojo sucks until part 4, but if you go in without watching parts 1-3 you will be LOST

[3:06:59] <%a_goth_pancake> you figured it out on your own woolz, be proud c:
[3:06:59] <VJdarkworld> it breaks the game in 2016, but eternals is based around it
[3:07:02] <brachydios777> @lewdskeletor13 Very

[3:11:00] <%lewdskeletor13> Doom moth

[3:11:12] <+rytyoung> ok time for sleps night all
[3:11:14] <somekindaspy> s'why you gotta focus up
[3:11:19] <%DesertPenguin> Shotgun shells goes from 16 to 24. Hardly anything
[3:11:20] <%omenzazu> night
[3:11:25] <somekindaspy> man i wish there was a way to translate that text on t he wall
[3:11:28] <%lewdskeletor13> @rytyoung Good night
[3:11:30] <somekindaspy> @rytyoung night
[3:11:33] <somekindaspy> sentinel
[3:11:33] <+Posichronic> 24 shells, hell yeah!
[3:11:40] <%Asuterisuku> Just chainsaw.
[3:11:51] <%a_goth_pancake> "24 shells, are you fucking kidding me?!" rip civvie 2020
[3:11:51] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:11:52] <spidervenomized> @DesertPenguin the biggest problem with doom eternal
[3:12:03] <+RealThiele> quad shotty might be ok for that
[3:12:04] <%DesertPenguin> Agreed
[3:12:09] <Bodregg> oh hey civvie, the guy who's bad at [doom eternal/blood]
[3:12:12] <%DesertPenguin> Other guns get a decent ammo upgrade but shotgun is fucked
[3:12:13] <BusterRepukken> the first half of that video is Civvie acting like a total boomer but then it clicks for him
[3:12:13] <$legacy0117> Yeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyey
[3:12:14] <TheAmazingClaytor> @a_goth_pancake What happened to civvie?
[3:12:24] <%DesertPenguin> ?
[3:12:34] <RichochetForce> Yes, that green wolf might have been Noviks
[3:12:36] <%DesertPenguin> They're all dead
[3:12:38] <RichochetForce> Remember, it leads you to him.
[3:12:38] <%lewdskeletor13> Ohhhhhh
[3:12:39] <spidervenomized> yeas they can
[3:12:41] <%a_goth_pancake> @theamazingclaytor the beginning of doom eternal happened to him lol
[3:12:43] <somekindaspy> oh shit i didnt even think of that
[3:12:44] <%Asuterisuku> Je realized he had to git gud.
[3:12:45] <megamonmon123> yeah probably
[3:12:45] <Crippl3> I love that these guys are putting more thought into this than iD Software did lol
[3:12:46] <DelgotHansto> The WOLVES GOT CORRUPTED TOO
[3:12:47] <brachydios777> @theamazingclaytor He adapts to the game: gita gud
[3:12:48] <Bodregg> yes that is the implication
[3:12:48] <%lewdskeletor13> I didn’t even think about that Woolie
[3:12:53] <DeathByPoke7> wheres the green bunny tho
[3:12:55] <$legacy0117> YEP.
[3:12:56] <RogueMinja> Probably.
[3:13:09] <%lewdskeletor13> That’s a good cal Woolie
[3:13:18] <Bodregg> @DeathByPoke7 nowhere, because that would imply that an orange bunny exists and no one wants that
[3:13:24] <somekindaspy> Oooh yeah, Hugo said that the daisy sightings in this game are all a hallucination
[3:13:26] <%a_goth_pancake> green bunny stand when
[3:13:32] <DelgotHansto> Motherfuckers stole the wraith energy
[3:13:39] <+azeDevs> azpngPup
[3:13:39] <somekindaspy> Wraiths are dead now
[3:13:44] <+Posichronic> Doomguy gets a ghost rabbit instead.
[3:13:49] <RichochetForce> Big Boss & Diamond Dog
[3:13:50] <RunningNGunning> GO! POPPY
[3:13:50] <%Asuterisuku> It's for the DLC.
[3:13:51] <%lewdskeletor13> Maybe the DLC will let us summon a good boi
[3:13:52] <DelgotHansto> Can't have shit in Argent D'Nur
[3:13:55] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Shoot the padawan
[3:14:00] <Tha_Mik> Poppy nooo
[3:14:04] <%lewdskeletor13> It’s a spectral dog tho
[3:14:05] <%omenzazu> @delgothansto well yeah there were alot of traitors.
[3:14:06] <+Promessa_EX> tlou2
[3:14:07] <Ozmodyas> Well, these are ghost dogs right, they can't die
[3:14:09] <RichochetForce> It's also bad media
[3:14:12] <BusterRepukken> You can just re-summon it tho
[3:14:12] <peachy996> what if we played as the Betrayer who could use doggo?
[3:14:14] <TheAmazingClaytor> Counterpoint: If doggo dies, MC gains rage mode for X amount of time
[3:14:17] <RichochetForce> Video clips of a yelping dog being abused in your game
[3:14:17] <RogueMinja> But rage makes you stronger.
[3:14:17] <%Skullgod> Doom Slayer would summon a bunny
[3:14:21] <Crippl3> wow, it's almost as if attack dogs are inherently animal cruelty pieThink
[3:14:21] <%Livelinne> Agroooooo BibleThump
[3:14:22] <somekindaspy> a big vault with your name on it

[3:14:46] <%DesertPenguin> Pupper
[3:14:52] <somekindaspy> we got a timed puzzle here
[3:14:57] <%DesertPenguin> Sif was a good dog
[3:15:00] <%DesertPenguin> Sif didn't deserve that
[3:15:04] <Bodregg> i dunno man, video games have conditioned me to view any dog on a computer screen as an enemy
[3:15:07] <RAH001> but you sent da dog to maul someones face
[3:15:13] <somekindaspy> same, bod reg
[3:15:18] <peachy996> Sif knew the score
[3:15:18] <somekindaspy> nah it cancelled
[3:15:22] <%a_goth_pancake> too slow
[3:15:24] <somekindaspy> oh shit
[3:15:28] <somekindaspy> fight time
[3:15:28] <%jinking79> just don't order chinese
[3:15:31] <%DesertPenguin> Oh we're almost done
[3:15:31] <+Navekraith> Everyone thinks they should hit the dog........until the owner goes into a John Wick like Rip and Tear episode!
[3:15:34] <%DesertPenguin> I love how this ends
[3:15:38] <RichochetForce> Yes
[3:15:41] <TheAmazingClaytor> Oh yes
[3:15:41] <somekindaspy> Remember, the Slayer was a warrior king. This is his vault.
[3:15:45] <+demegodz> YEYEYEYE
[3:15:45] <%DesertPenguin> It's a giant safe
[3:15:49] <%lewdskeletor13> Poggers
[3:15:49] <%DesertPenguin> Like a bank safe
[3:15:51] <Bodregg> dogs are just mobile berserk packs?
[3:15:53] <%a_goth_pancake> yeyeye
[3:15:55] <%Javaa01> It's your vault
[3:15:57] <somekindaspy> second to last one
[3:15:57] <+segmentedfool> This is the slayers personal vault
[3:16:02] <WanderingSwordsman> Its your vault
[3:16:02] <TheAmazingClaytor> ITS PAYDAY FELLAS
[3:16:06] <%DesertPenguin> @javaa01 Use it when YOU need it lol
[3:16:06] <%lewdskeletor13> He wore the crown of the night sentinels
[3:16:11] <%a_goth_pancake> swiggity swooty, time to get that looty
[3:16:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> I MADE IT BACK IN TIME YES
[3:16:21] <%Asuterisuku> The CROWN.
[3:16:36] <RichochetForce> @lewdskeletor13 Wraith energy lept from his Crucible blade like only that of true warrior-kings
[3:16:42] <%a_goth_pancake> where's my doomguy skin with a biggie crown all times to the side?
[3:16:50] <%a_goth_pancake> tilted
[3:16:53] <%lewdskeletor13> brownHANDS
[3:16:58] <%cobalt_phoenix_> BETRAYAL
[3:17:04] <+paladinstarbuster> nope
[3:17:05] <RichochetForce> Treason!
[3:17:14] <peachy996> Betrayel but also they weirdly told the truth
[3:17:16] <RogueMinja> Nah.
[3:17:16] <+paladinstarbuster> wait yep
[3:17:19] <$legacy0117> Guess what Circle of the City of the dead is?
[3:17:19] <brachydios777> BETRAYAL
[3:17:19] <somekindaspy> nah, novik was dead. the slayer was the king at this point
[3:17:23] <LeviathanNexus> the betrayer
[3:17:24] <alphalejandro> Novik sama
[3:17:28] <brachydios777> Reverse
[3:17:30] <%lewdskeletor13> The Slayer was the king
[3:17:37] <%a_goth_pancake> king doomguy
[3:17:39] <%tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus i believe novik was dead - the slayer was the king
[3:17:40] <Bodregg> the king is drawn from the night sentinels
[3:17:43] <spidervenomized> king vs maykr with the priest being traitors
[3:17:43] <somekindaspy> The Slayer was the King, ruling from Taras Nabad at this point.
[3:17:45] <+Posichronic> Doomguy was king.
[3:17:46] <%a_goth_pancake> royal unf
[3:17:48] <+paladinstarbuster> The did say slayer wore the crown
[3:17:48] <$legacy0117> 3rd.
[3:17:54] <%HostilePoundcakes> king passed away doom guy became new king
[3:17:58] <RichochetForce> Yes
[3:18:04] <%DesertPenguin> I missed that bit
[3:18:07] <%lewdskeletor13> In 2016 they said “He wore the crown on the night sentinels”
[3:18:13] <+YabbaTroll> kinda hard to be king when you dont talk
[3:18:13] <%DesertPenguin> Why is Slayer the heir to the throne?
[3:18:19] <+YabbaTroll> cause hes rad
[3:18:20] <alphalejandro> Doom Slayer = waga maou
[3:18:21] <%Asuterisuku> imagine having a mute king.
[3:18:22] <somekindaspy> @DesertPenguin he earned it
[3:18:24] <%DesertPenguin> Fair enough
[3:18:24] <+RealThiele> Prosperous Society and Tear
[3:18:28] <DelgotHansto> Cause hes the baddest dude
[3:18:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> because he's big and strong
[3:18:29] <brachydios777> Wore the crown of the night sentinels
[3:18:37] <%tearfuldevil> @Asuterisuku sign language i guess?
[3:18:38] <spidervenomized> @DesertPenguin he was the messiah to the sentinals
[3:18:44] <peachy996> @Asuterisuku sounds great
[3:18:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> they SPLIT THE PARTY
[3:18:46] <grimshuck> @desertpenguin He slayed the titan
[3:18:48] <strifer413> eclipse
[3:18:48] <+Posichronic> Slayer's throne is in this level.
[3:18:49] <LeviathanNexus> The Betrayer caused the fall
[3:18:50] <RichochetForce> Argenta Kings lead from the head of the army
[3:18:50] <%lewdskeletor13> brownHANDS
[3:18:53] <$legacy0117> Novik died, Doom Slayer, being next strongest took his place.
[3:18:53] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[3:19:36] <Calek> if I was plagued by visions of my son being tortured in hell I'd probably try to get a good deal out of it too
[3:19:36] <DelgotHansto> Remember when it was doom guys son who was resurrected as the icon of sin
[3:19:40] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @a_goth_pancake boys of his sword LUL

[3:21:42] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> When it happens, it is worth it.
[3:21:43] <Bodregg> i dunno dude, it being a water level detracts like at least all of its points @DesertPenguin

[3:25:01] <RichochetForce> @DelgotHansto True, just from the shock of the damn throne
[3:25:04] <Solidnick18> hmmm
[3:25:09] <+Posichronic> Titan's Realm is literally a mountain of corpses.

[3:25:36] <+Blackjackal95> He did war cry
[3:25:37] <%FuqBoiSlim> we stan an illiterate king
[3:25:38] <somekindaspy> I mean he could probably still write?

[3:26:41] <%DesertPenguin> Jump, wait, dash , wait, dash
[3:26:44] <somekindaspy> @Bodregg his tax policy is "bring me 9 demon heads by the end of the month"
[3:26:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> doom guy would never hit it tho
[3:26:47] <$legacy0117> Goooooood find.
[3:26:49] <%DesertPenguin> You're doing it too fast

[3:30:08] <somekindaspy> Woolie you missed a secret
[3:30:10] <%Asuterisuku> The water is fine.
[3:30:11] <prime_name> Swimming isn't good in this game
[3:30:15] <%DesertPenguin> He can fast travel back
[3:30:15] <DelgotHansto> Is this Samuels doo-doo fart water?
[3:30:18] <%a_goth_pancake> love that sound effect
[3:30:23] <%DesertPenguin> Agreed, not fun, but definitely not hard like some people say
[3:30:25] <Bodregg> @DelgotHansto no it's khan maykr's
[3:30:28] <%nawji> is it worse than DMC1 underwater?
[3:30:28] <SaiyanShoto> Thank god it's barely in the game
[3:30:29] <%SuperKirby24> oh fuck this is the secret where you had to find out the best place to drop and punch huh
[3:30:31] <%DesertPenguin> punch
[3:30:40] <RichochetForce> Nice audio telegraphing on the Pinky
[3:30:42] <%Neoepochx> I like how on the New Blood podcast one of the Doom Eternal Devs said that swimming was a holdover from Doom 2016, that HE made.
[3:30:46] <+MajiOMNI> lol
[3:30:50] <%DesertPenguin> lol
[3:30:53] <%Asuterisuku> Nothing is worse than DMC1 underwater.

[3:31:04] <%DesertPenguin> switch grenades
[3:31:06] <somekindaspy> @Neoepochx so why did he bring it back?
[3:31:13] <%DesertPenguin> siwtch grenades
[3:31:21] <youthgonewild77> @neoepochx Who is he???
[3:31:30] <%Neoepochx> @somekindaspy He thought it was cool. Everyone yelled at him in the cast LUL
[3:31:32] <$legacy0117> DOOM Slayer has a bit of cleanup to do.
[3:31:33] <spidervenomized> @Neoepochx they should have left it to rot
[3:31:36] <%Neoepochx> @youthgonewild77 I'll look it up.
[3:31:37] <%a_goth_pancake> remember; short controlled bursts
[3:31:54] <%GrassCannon> weird-sounding map
[3:31:57] <DelgotHansto> A simple time
[3:32:04] <DelgotHansto> 2017
[3:32:18] <DelgotHansto> WHere we pondered on the utterances of a fox
[3:32:24] <youthgonewild77> Wasn't expecting that to be answered on a podcast
[3:32:31] <%Neoepochx> @youthgonewild77 It was Mark Diaz LUL
[3:32:32] <somekindaspy> gotta shoot that
[3:32:35] <%a_goth_pancake> Jesus that was 2017
[3:32:36] <%Neoepochx> I totally forgot it was him.
[3:32:46] <%DesertPenguin> What are you guys talking about?
[3:32:49] <+CryptusMaximus> I feel like I'm the only person who enjoys the swimming. Reminds me of games like Tomb Raider. And the change in pace is nice. Now the purple goop. THAT stuff can go fuck itself.
[3:32:55] <DelgotHansto> @a_goth_pancake think it was actually before now that i think about it
[3:32:55] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:33:00] <%DesertPenguin> What happened in 2017?
[3:33:07] <%DesertPenguin> And a fox?
[3:33:08] <RichochetForce> @CryptusMaximus That stuff had no place in a game about mobility
[3:33:09] <DelgotHansto> What does the fox say
[3:33:13] <DelgotHansto> maybe
[3:33:13] <RichochetForce> Let alone appearing as often as it did
[3:33:16] <DelgotHansto> probably not
[3:33:18] <MasterTonberry23> This is probably the worst level of the game. Luckily it never gets this bad again
[3:33:25] <youthgonewild77> Welp, now I know, thanks
[3:33:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that's the way
[3:33:39] <spidervenomized> @CryptusMaximus the problem that the rad drains way to quickly and dmaged way to quickly
[3:33:50] <%a_goth_pancake> that pickup sfx reminds me of old build games woolieMIRIN
[3:33:52] <RichochetForce> Heat blast is mean as hell
[3:34:00] <CoffeeSlice> LUL
[3:34:02] <%DesertPenguin> People saying this is the worst level for 5-10 minutes of water gameplay are seriously just whining. Overall it's barely part of the level. It shouldn't ruin the whole thing for you
[3:34:03] <DelgotHansto> OH NO I CHECKED ITS 2013
[3:34:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LUL
[3:34:04] <RichochetForce> @a_goth_pancake You should try out ion Fury
[3:34:14] <RichochetForce> A Build engine game with the same satisfying pick up sounds
[3:34:16] <%DesertPenguin> Delgot, Whatchu on about?
[3:34:25] <TheAmazingClaytor> THICC
[3:34:28] <DelgotHansto> THAT DUMB SONG REGGIE SANG
[3:34:32] <%a_goth_pancake> @richochetforce etc yeah ion fury. wish it was still ion maiden.
[3:34:32] <%Neoepochx> Minute 37 of the first New Blood Podcast. Mark Diaz of Id was like, "We had it for 2016, and I pushed for it to come back in Eternal"
[3:34:33] <%Asuterisuku> Weapon Switching isn't just for Marauders.
[3:34:36] <DelgotHansto> WHAT DOES THE FOX SAY
[3:34:42] <somekindaspy> yo that combo was thick tho
[3:34:48] <+CryptusMaximus> @RichochetForce Yeah, thankfully it's really only shitty in the level it gets introduced in, because its mandatory. In the Arc Headquarters level its fine, because you can completely avoid it if you're good enough at navigation.
[3:34:49] <somekindaspy> last one
[3:34:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @WoolieVersus

[3:38:36] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus that was answered
[3:38:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> they managed to trap them
[3:38:36] <Calek> 2016 explains why he's in the coffin
[3:38:37] <LeviathanNexus> They dropped a temple on him, they explained last game
[3:38:37] <somekindaspy> they already explained it in 2016
[3:38:37] <DeeVee_TV> They dropped a fucking temple on him
[3:38:37] <BlackermanZX> Remember they dropped a temple on him
[3:38:38] <%jubejube56> It was in the lore of 2016
[3:38:39] <Monkeyweed21> They collapsed an entire temple on him
[3:38:39] <RogueMinja> They dropped a temple on him.
[3:38:39] <+YabbaTroll> they dropped a temple on him
[3:38:41] <+green715> The temple got dropped on him
[3:38:41] <grimshuck> Hell set a trap for him.
[3:38:41] <Bodregg> it said that the demons collapsed a temple on him
[3:38:42] <somekindaspy> the dropped a temple on him
[3:38:42] <RunningNGunning> It was explained in 2016
[3:38:43] <Crippl3> That was in lore in 2016, the demons captured him and imprisoned him
[3:38:43] <Bodregg> samson style
[3:38:43] <%Neoepochx> The dropped the blood temple on him.
[3:38:43] <CoffeeSlice> they dropped a temple on him
[3:38:43] <%omenzazu> they trick him lol
[3:38:44] <+greenfall> they dropped a temple on him
[3:38:44] <LeviathanNexus> An entire temple
[3:38:45] <%jubejube56> They dropped a whole temple on him
[3:38:45] <%Asuterisuku> The coffin was explained in 2016.
[3:38:45] <%Zebroneath> When do we get to pilot a mech?
[3:38:46] <RichochetForce> The Hell Priests laid a trap
[3:38:47] <Ozmodyas> They had to drop a temple on him and seal him away because they couldn't kill him
[3:38:47] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> Demons dropped a building on him
[3:38:48] <%lewdskeletor13> They dropped a temple on him
[3:38:49] <resloxxx> They baited him and dropped the whole temple on him
[3:38:51] <%a_goth_pancake> *the only thing they fear is you begins*
[3:38:51] <brachydios777> Hell Preists
[3:38:51] <DelgotHansto> They dropped a temple on him
[3:38:52] <RichochetForce> and dropped the Kadingir Sanctum on him
[3:38:56] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> it was a trap
[3:39:00] <Gutsandlove> ripping and tearing
[3:39:01] <+MagicBeanBurrito> He was lured
[3:39:01] <@Solidus_113> he was knocked out
[3:39:01] <Bodregg> rule of cool
[3:39:02] <+YabbaTroll> he was knocked out i guess
[3:39:02] <%cobalt_phoenix_> he got ko'd i assume
[3:39:02] <whazat> just got bodied
[3:39:04] <somekindaspy> he was down and unconscious the priests stuffed him in
[3:39:05] <resloxxx> Baited with room full of demons to kill
[3:39:06] <%Neoepochx> The 2016 ghost boys.
[3:39:06] <Calek> they dropped a temple which knocked him out, then they put him in it
[3:39:07] <%nawji> @WoolieVersus lore in 2016 said that the demons dropped a temple on Doomguy and then sealed him in a coffin
[3:39:09] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Must have been knocked out or something.
[3:39:10] <+DukeBlack_> 2016 tells you in the message things
[3:39:15] <%Neoepochx> The temple didn't kill him, just knocked him out for a bit.
[3:39:17] <brachydios777> The temple knocked him out
[3:39:20] <%LordDukeFishington> the priests encased him
[3:39:21] <%NeroInfinite> He got KO'd bybeing luredi nto the temple yeah.
[3:39:24] <%lewdskeletor13> I think they put him in there cause they couldn’t kill him
[3:39:25] <+paladinstarbuster> Its not Just for Daisy its for Argent D'nur too BibleThump
[3:39:31] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> They put a lot of juicy demons under a cardboard box with a stick propping it up
[3:39:38] <Monkeyweed21> They weren't confident they could kill him
[3:39:40] <%a_goth_pancake> THE OBSIDIAN PILLARS OF THE BLOOD TEMPLES
[3:39:42] <resloxxx> DONT ANGRY OPEN INSIDE
[3:39:44] <whazat> don't worry too much about specifics, it's a metaphor for the 20 years before we got another fast paced doom game
[3:39:49] <somekindaspy> he was probably in that coffin for a thousand years
[3:39:53] <somekindaspy> who knows
[3:39:53] <RichochetForce> Seal him away FOREVER
[3:39:53] <%Neoepochx> @WoolieVersus These guys are the ghost boiz too.
[3:39:53] <$legacy0117> YEP. And he never stopped, for so long that Hell decided to call for HELP. HELL asked for HELP.
[3:39:53] <%lewdskeletor13> @paladinstarbuster And his grandpa Commander Keen too
[3:39:57] <+YabbaTroll> is that dopefish in the top right?
[3:39:57] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule

[3:40:40] <somekindaspy> @Neoepochx true
[3:40:41] <+CascadiaStudio> hullo
[3:40:42] <BlackermanZX> the Slayer wasnt trapped in hell. HELL was trapped with HIM
[3:40:42] <%MillaMoks> @WoolieVersus Doom guy is basically the "demon lord to powerful to be defeated so he was sealed by the heroes" except it was the demons who had to do the sealing this time.
[3:40:43] <anita_dickin> HE IS HERE
[3:40:44] <Ner234> Hell : "Fuck"
[3:40:45] <RichochetForce> He knew who was in the coffin.

[3:40:54] <+BubbaRands> WHY IS YOU BACK?!

[3:41:01] <Ner234> Aww shit
[3:41:02] <+BubbaRands> HOW DID YOU GET HERE?!
[3:41:04] <Ozmodyas> That first Imp in DOOM 2016 wasn't snarling to intimidate you, he was shitting himself with fear
[3:41:05] <Gutsandlove> in, i a mean
[3:41:05] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> We don't have another temple!
[3:41:06] <brachydios777> Wha happun?- Hell
[3:41:08] <%DesertPenguin> In the last game? Yea context is great
[3:41:09] <%a_goth_pancake> but who said?
[3:41:13] <somekindaspy> That voice was The Dark Lord, too. That was basically "Devil God" saying "get ready, bois"
[3:41:14] <DelgotHansto> I WAS HOLDING THEM BACK
[3:41:16] <+BubbaRands> NOBODY'S S'POSED TO BE HERE
[3:41:22] <RichochetForce> In the first age
[3:41:23] <%lewdskeletor13> The Dark Lord I’m guessing
[3:41:25] <RichochetForce> In the first battle
[3:41:26] <Monkeyweed21> Doomguy ripped and teared so hard he reset the Demon Calender
[3:41:29] <$BrazenMask> IT makes a loot of sense that he hates argent energy from the start in 2016
[3:41:29] <%HostilePoundcakes> in the first battle

[3:41:50] <spidervenomized> @lewdskeletor13 the creator said that B.j blaskowitz is commander keen grandfather and keen was doom guy dad
[3:41:50] <+CryptusMaximus> That first fodder Imp in 2016 that charged him deserves a statue made in his name to be honest.

[3:45:58] <RichochetForce> It's that simple.
[3:45:58] <%lewdskeletor13> The Crucible with the infinite ammo cheat is fun

[3:46:00] <BlackermanZX> Fast travel unlocked?
[3:46:01] <$legacy0117> SO. Sword got 3 pips. One pip kills anything. HAVE FUN.
[3:46:07] <somekindaspy> lol at the glitched lost souls

[3:46:18] <Bodregg> @WoolieVersus it works on everything but marauders, but against doom hunters it just deletes a phase
[3:46:20] <brachydios777> Fast travel active
[3:46:20] <%Asuterisuku> One swing, one kill.

[3:46:28] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> ya love to see it
[3:46:28] <%DesertPenguin> They don't regen
[3:46:29] <+Strigiform> this arena lies, you only get 1-2 pickups at most per level from now on for crucible
[3:46:30] <RogueMinja> Now get the last secret.
[3:46:30] <%Neoepochx> Nah they don't you just missed those.
[3:46:31] <DelgotHansto> WORKS ON MARUADERS TOO
[3:46:33] <%DesertPenguin> Do they?
[3:46:35] <%Neoepochx> Missing 1 secret.
[3:46:36] <+RealThiele> now check for upgrades
[3:46:37] <spidervenomized> fast travel
[3:46:38] <%DesertPenguin> Just in this one area for fun?
[3:46:39] <somekindaspy> It only works if the marauders are staggered
[3:46:41] <BlackermanZX> missing some things
[3:46:41] <DelgotHansto> YOU GOTTA STUN THEM THOUGH
[3:46:45] <resloxxx> MISSING 1 SECRET
[3:46:45] <somekindaspy> you missed a lore
[3:46:46] <+greenfall> one secret left
[3:46:46] <%lewdskeletor13> They regen in this area
[3:46:46] <%Asuterisuku> Fast Travel, Woolie.
[3:46:46] <$legacy0117> Load all those SWORD pipes laying around and save it.
[3:46:52] <peachy996> Now you can either finish level or bang your head on this secret
[3:46:52] <%DesertPenguin> BEcause you don't need them anymore
[3:46:52] <$legacy0117> pips*
[3:46:53] <%a_goth_pancake> think tactically with your sword woolz
[3:46:56] <%DesertPenguin> You don't need them
[3:46:56] <memes_are_cancer> Works on Marauders but the timing is iffy
[3:46:58] <%NeroInfinite> they give you enough sword pips to kill all the bigbys
[3:46:58] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:46:58] <%FuqBoiSlim> HE MISSED A SECTET PLAYTHROUGH OVER
[3:46:59] <somekindaspy> You missed a secret
[3:47:00] <%Neoepochx> Berserk is only in 2 places right?
[3:47:01] <Tha_Mik> For big boys only
[3:47:05] <RichochetForce> Yes, Crucible is for special appointment enemies.
[3:47:06] <%Zebroneath> Selective problem solver
[3:47:07] <DelgotHansto> Only one beserk in the game
[3:47:09] <%DesertPenguin> The drop fall is such a hard one to get
[3:47:12] <somekindaspy> I think it's in the Divinity Machine room.
[3:47:12] <+RealThiele> berserk packs lacking
[3:47:13] <Bodregg> The Crucible 1hits everything but Doom Hunters (Removes the sled if its in phase 1, kills it in phase 2) and Marauders (Doesn't work at all)
[3:47:13] <%Javaa01> Throne Room
[3:47:14] <RogueMinja> Throne room.
[3:47:14] <DeeVee_TV> Throne Room
[3:47:14] <%Neoepochx> It is a doom 3 reference Kappa
[3:47:15] <%Josef_Stryker> The Crucible is basically a "I REALLY don't wanna deal with this guy" button
[3:47:15] <%DesertPenguin> Start in throne room
[3:47:15] <@Solidus_113> above
[3:47:16] <%Klefth> Well there you fucking have your pickup powerups, now in the form of pips
[3:47:18] <whazat> Throne Room for sure
[3:47:18] <RichochetForce> Throne Room
[3:47:18] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> above
[3:47:19] <LeviathanNexus> Gotta fall into it
[3:47:20] <resloxxx> Throne room
[3:47:20] <spidervenomized> yes that one
[3:47:21] <Klarrann3> that secret is really annoying to get
[3:47:21] <%DesertPenguin> It's a drop
[3:47:21] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> probably
[3:47:21] <+TheNeonGraveyard> I think that last item is a tricky drop
[3:47:22] <%Asuterisuku> @neoepochx Only one.
[3:47:22] <Hal10k> Fuck this secret
[3:47:22] <grimshuck> This secret is a bastard
[3:47:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> throne room
[3:47:25] <+CryptusMaximus> The real Beserk mode was inside you all along
[3:47:26] <%lewdskeletor13> There’s like two berserks the whole game
[3:47:28] <%DesertPenguin> Use the slow-mo air control
[3:47:28] <%a_goth_pancake> doomguy only crucibles demons by special appointment nowadays
[3:47:34] <TheyCallMeVawn> This is a tricky one
[3:47:36] <%DesertPenguin> On your way out
[3:47:37] <raikagelord1> A drop
[3:47:37] <%Neoepochx> @Asuterisuku The one in ARC Complex?
[3:47:42] <@Solidus_113> time slow helps here
[3:47:43] <%lewdskeletor13> This one is fucky
[3:47:43] <DelgotHansto> @Bodregg totally works on a staggered marauder and its sick
[3:47:44] <somekindaspy> there should be no demons here since you cleared the level
[3:47:45] <%DesertPenguin> next one
[3:47:48] <0rond> crucible is your "fuck this tyrant/archie/baron in particular"
[3:47:49] <%DesertPenguin> Over here
[3:47:51] <Solidnick18> yep
[3:47:53] <%DesertPenguin> It's down here
[3:47:58] <Bodregg> i've never seen that before delgot, is there a video of it?
[3:48:00] <somekindaspy> yes you need to use the slow-down rune
[3:48:01] <%DesertPenguin> Map
[3:48:02] <Crippl3> it's about halfway down that drop
[3:48:05] <+TheNeonGraveyard> This one's tricky
[3:48:05] <%Asuterisuku> Mario's is the only Berserk in the game.
[3:48:05] <%Neoepochx> Use slow mo to help control the fall
[3:48:08] <Solidnick18> it's in the walls
[3:48:10] <%a_goth_pancake> crucie is the anti-rauder if you're in a corner.
[3:48:15] <Solidnick18> very specfic spot
[3:48:19] <%DesertPenguin> Think of it as 12 o'clock and you're at 1
[3:48:21] <whazat> you have to hit it mid drop, using the slow-down rune or the weapon wheel can really help here
[3:48:22] <%a_goth_pancake> right
[3:48:24] <somekindaspy> @a_goth_pancake only if they're already staggered, though and at that point it's a waste
[3:48:38] <RogueMinja> Use gun slow mo.
[3:48:41] <%Neoepochx> Scope can help you see it.
[3:48:47] <somekindaspy> just gotta dash into it
[3:48:50] <BlackermanZX> use slow mo
[3:48:52] <DelgotHansto> @Bodregg Yeah never actually done it myself but I saw it in an all glory kills video, hes got an awesome kill with the berserk powerup aswell
[3:48:55] <Crippl3> @somekindaspy but it's cool tho
[3:48:56] <+TheNeonGraveyard> you can always fast travel and try again
[3:49:01] <%a_goth_pancake> @somekindaspy wait did they patch it?
[3:49:04] <+MajiOMNI> this secret is a pain
[3:49:05] <%DesertPenguin> is that it?
[3:49:07] <%ekodrop> whoa still live
[3:49:07] <whazat> not it
[3:49:10] <RichochetForce> It's a cracked wall
[3:49:11] <%DesertPenguin> Not it
[3:49:11] <%Neoepochx> Further down
[3:49:12] <Crippl3> this is the worst secret in the game
[3:49:12] <somekindaspy> @a_goth_pancake pretty sure, yeah
[3:49:12] <whazat> pretty sure it's a breakable
[3:49:14] <%DesertPenguin> It's a wall crack
[3:49:15] <Bodregg> you sure it wasn't the one where you grab their axe and kill them with it?
[3:49:17] <Solidnick18> if you see a crack
[3:49:18] <%Irridium> this one was annoying to get
[3:49:21] <$legacy0117> Also this drop, is alllll the Sentinels ashen remains in nooks
[3:49:23] <RogueMinja> Crack in the wall.
[3:49:26] <RichochetForce> It's a platform hidden by a cracked wall
[3:49:27] <anita_dickin> no platform
[3:49:27] <%lewdskeletor13> Gotta dash through it
[3:49:30] <$legacy0117> Just fyi
[3:49:32] <anita_dickin> wall crack
[3:49:34] <+greenfall> its a craked wal in that area
[3:49:35] <%HostilePoundcakes> crack in the wall
[3:49:35] <%LordDukeFishington> you have to punch a hole in the wall
[3:49:38] <%kyh9> Gotta bust through it
[3:49:38] <somekindaspy> crack in the wall you gotta dash into. it's hard
[3:49:39] <%a_goth_pancake> oh shit, am I thinking of the axe glory kill?
[3:49:40] <+Posichronic> Weapon wheel on the way down
[3:49:41] <spidervenomized> cracked wall
[3:49:41] <Klarrann3> It's a cracked wall
[3:49:46] <somekindaspy> @a_goth_pancake probably
[3:49:47] <%a_goth_pancake> left
[3:49:50] <%DesertPenguin> Woolie just go down and get a better view. You can fast travel back and try again as many times as you want
[3:49:53] <%kyh9> Crack in the wall
[3:49:53] <somekindaspy> on the marauder's right
[3:49:56] <DelgotHansto> @Bodregg 100% certain he split the video up to regular,chainsaw,crucible and berserk kills
[3:49:57] <DeeVee_TV> You can seee it here
[3:50:00] <%Neoepochx> You got fast travel, so no big deal
[3:50:04] <+TheNeonGraveyard> Probably gonna take a couple tries
[3:50:11] <%DesertPenguin> Took me at least 5
[3:50:12] <anita_dickin> its BS is what it is
[3:50:13] <somekindaspy> yeah no judgement here. this one is rough
[3:50:13] <RogueMinja> Fall slow mo.
[3:50:19] <%DesertPenguin> wrong gun for that
[3:50:24] <somekindaspy> I saw it
[3:50:28] <%DesertPenguin> use the shotgun or anything that doesn't zoom in like that
[3:50:29] <peachy996> saw it
[3:50:32] <anita_dickin> too early
[3:50:32] <%Neoepochx> This is a tricky one.
[3:50:34] <%a_goth_pancake> starboard
[3:50:35] <DelgotHansto> @Bodregg cuts off both arms then cleaves him in two
[3:50:37] <%Javaa01> Right angle, but too early
[3:50:39] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> ye
[3:50:40] <%lewdskeletor13> It’s a real tricky one
[3:50:48] <somekindaspy> @Javaa01 what this dude said
[3:50:52] <somekindaspy> I saw it
[3:50:52] <%DesertPenguin> Tricky a.k.a. A BITCH
[3:50:52] <%Neoepochx> Once you get it once, you never forget it.
[3:50:54] <RichochetForce> It flashed by real quick
[3:50:58] <RichochetForce> Yellow question mark
[3:51:01] <ShortAssRibs> Dis on PC?
[3:51:05] <%Javaa01> It is brightly lit
[3:51:05] <RichochetForce> PS4
[3:51:06] <somekindaspy> @ShortAssRibs ps4
[3:51:07] <%lewdskeletor13> Ps4
[3:51:18] <RogueMinja> I saw it.
[3:51:19] <%Javaa01> It was that gate
[3:51:20] <whazat> it's that little caged area
[3:51:21] <%Neoepochx> It was that Question Mark
[3:51:23] <+segmentedfool> It was the gate
[3:51:24] <%SuperKirby24> yeah fuck that challenge
[3:51:25] <RichochetForce> Just saw it again
[3:51:27] <+Ether101_Prime> Half way down.
[3:51:29] <BlackermanZX> it was a cage yeah
[3:51:34] <%a_goth_pancake> above the ?
[3:51:35] <%kyh9> The little cage looking spot
[3:51:38] <%Klefth> It was that gate you saw on the way down
[3:51:42] <daemonazaezal> you have to fall to it from the top
[3:51:45] <peachy996> Yellow Question Mark
[3:51:45] <%DesertPenguin> Do this and then you're done
[3:51:47] <spidervenomized> it the worst one
[3:51:48] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> punch i think
[3:51:52] <+greenfall> dash into it
[3:51:54] <%lewdskeletor13> I believe in you
[3:51:54] <brachydios777> On the right
[3:51:56] <%DesertPenguin> Can't believe how long this level took with Woolie's pace
[3:52:01] <%a_goth_pancake> feel your pain woolz, this one sucked
[3:52:01] <$legacy0117> To the right a little bit, it was behind bars
[3:52:05] <%Neoepochx> Use up the slow mo
[3:52:06] <whazat> just a cracked wall, but you can see it when you are on top of it
[3:52:10] <%Neoepochx> And recharge
[3:52:15] <%Neoepochx> Yea
[3:52:18] <+Posichronic> Dash into it
[3:52:22] <ShortAssRibs> YOLO
[3:52:22] <%HostilePoundcakes> Dashing into cracked walls will auto punch
[3:52:24] <DelgotHansto> Theres a dumb thing with momentumwhere if you're falling for too long you can't activate double jump which fucked me up for this one
[3:52:40] <%DesertPenguin> IT's just past where you can't see
[3:52:40] <somekindaspy> @HostilePoundcakes What this dude said. You automatically break walls you dash into
[3:52:41] <$legacy0117> You'll probably need to shoot into one of this holes
[3:52:45] <%DesertPenguin> The second layer of tombs
[3:52:48] <$legacy0117> those*
[3:52:48] <RichochetForce> Bingo bango
[3:52:50] <%Neoepochx> Yeyeyey
[3:52:50] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> there you go
[3:52:52] <%Josef_Stryker> This one is a bitch and a half to get to
[3:52:52] <%Neoepochx> Found it
[3:52:54] <%a_goth_pancake> the dark area
[3:53:01] <%Neoepochx> Gotta build up slow mo again
[3:53:03] <DelgotHansto> A thrilling finale to this stream

[3:57:46] <@Solidus_113> below you
[3:57:48] <umbrellaswereawesome> Doom 64. It was actually pretty good there.
[3:57:49] <%Neoepochx> Once you got all the Demon Keys it as stupid OP
[3:57:49] <$legacy0117> Doom 64 time.
[3:57:50] <%DesertPenguin> So this is just fan service for that game

[3:57:52] <%a_goth_pancake> yep
[3:57:58] <RichochetForce> Yes
[3:57:58] <somekindaspy> nope
[3:58:01] <Tha_Mik> It was different
[3:58:02] <%a_goth_pancake> laser pew pew
[3:58:02] <+BigCoffee> no
[3:58:03] <%tearfuldevil> no
[3:58:04] <Invertin> it was spelled Unmaker, not Mayker
[3:58:04] <%Neoepochx> Un Make Them
[3:58:04] <Saltmeisterr> actually no
[3:58:05] <alphalejandro> kinda
[3:58:06] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> kinda
[3:58:06] <+greenfall> yes and no
[3:58:06] <%DesertPenguin> IT didn't have that context back then
[3:58:08] <BlackermanZX> Iwasnt it called Unmaker
[3:58:08] <SjoeB89> Doom 64 Has new content that links to this game now with steam edition.
[3:58:11] <+MajiOMNI> no, they changed the spelling
[3:58:12] <%Irridium> I did LUL
[3:58:12] <brachydios777> It was from hell at first
[3:58:12] <spidervenomized> no
[3:58:13] <%a_goth_pancake> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[3:58:14] <+CryptusMaximus> It was spelled differently unfortunately
[3:58:15] <+Strigiform> it was called Unmaker in 64 i think
[3:58:16] <%Neoepochx> It was spelled differently in 64
[3:58:16] <Bodregg> they just put a Y in it
[3:58:16] <Tha_Mik> It was called Unmaker
[3:58:19] <anita_dickin> you knew?
[3:58:19] <RichochetForce> Maker and Makyr is a barely changed spelling

[3:58:24] <DeeVee_TV> down a level
[3:58:24] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus in Doom 64 the gun was Un-Maker, in Eternal it's retconned to Maykr
[3:58:25] <Invertin> @WoolieVersus it was spelled Unmaker, not Unmakyr in 64
[3:58:25] <+Ether101_Prime> The name was changed the spelling form Unmaker.
[3:58:25] <somekindaspy> back
[3:58:26] <somekindaspy> no
[3:58:26] <whazat> downstairs
[3:58:27] <+BigCoffee> it used to be the Unmaker not Unmairk
[3:58:28] <%Josef_Stryker> Downstairs
[3:58:28] <%lewdskeletor13> The gun was called Unmaker originally, they added the Y to fit in with this lore
[3:58:28] <%nawji> In Doom 64 it was a secret weapon that was absolute shit but by doing secret levels you could upgrade it's power, eventually making it extremely overpowered
[3:58:30] <Crippl3> It was called the Unmaker in Doom 64, not the Unmaykr
[3:58:32] <RunningNGunning> Down i think
[3:58:33] <anita_dickin> dig down smartie
[3:58:40] <somekindaspy> @nawji it's implied in the DLCs we will be able to upgrade it
[3:58:48] <%a_goth_pancake> downstairz
[3:58:50] <resloxxx> Better use those batteries @WoolieVersus Kappa
[3:58:52] <RichochetForce> @somekindaspy Yeah, I noticed that

[3:59:03] <%a_goth_pancake> time for Kreygasm
[3:59:04] <peachy996> But it's no BFG
[3:59:04] <%SuperKirby24> MMMMMMMM
[3:59:05] <%lewdskeletor13> I liked it
[3:59:05] <Saltmeisterr> @somekindaspy wait really? source?
[3:59:06] <whazat> it's ok, definitely no BFG
[3:59:06] <heart_ablaze> ULTIMATE POWERRRRRRRR

[3:59:09] <%SuperKirby24> Kreygasn
[3:59:13] <%SuperKirby24> Kreygasm
[3:59:16] <anita_dickin> Fully auto bfg
[3:59:17] <Tha_Mik> Rapidfire bfg
[3:59:20] <%a_goth_pancake> you're right, it's better
[3:59:22] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @CryptusMaximus
[3:59:22] <%DesertPenguin> IT's a three-wide burst
[3:59:27] <heart_ablaze> RAPID FIRE BFG
[3:59:27] <%DesertPenguin> Very situational
[3:59:28] <%Asuterisuku> It uses BFG ammo, so use it sparingly.
[3:59:30] <%Javaa01> Contra spread shot
[3:59:33] <LSether> i actually prefer the BFG
[3:59:35] <Tha_Mik> Use it only for funsies
[3:59:35] <@Solidus_113> pew pew
[3:59:36] <%DesertPenguin> BFG is still better
[3:59:37] <alphalejandro> yep
[3:59:38] <%a_goth_pancake> un.make.them.
[3:59:39] <+Posichronic> That button isn't grounded properly.
[3:59:39] <%lewdskeletor13> Like butter
[3:59:41] <%DesertPenguin> NOPE
[3:59:41] <KeystoneA2> @WoolieVersus The Unmaykr is mainly for super heavy enemies that corner you in a closet-- BFG is best for everything else.
[3:59:41] <RichochetForce> Boss melter
[3:59:42] <Crippl3> Yeah TBH the BFG is actually way better
[3:59:43] <+BigCoffee> bfg still better
[3:59:43] <%DesertPenguin> WASTE OF AMMO
[3:59:45] <RogueMinja> BFG is better.
[3:59:46] <Bodregg> it's actually worse crowd control than BFG @WoolieVersus
[3:59:46] <%a_goth_pancake> fuck the BFG
[3:59:46] <%Josef_Stryker> BFG is way better unfortunately
[3:59:47] <+MajiOMNI> bfg is better unfortunately
[3:59:47] <+demegodz> Kinda
[3:59:47] <heart_ablaze> yes
[3:59:50] <BlackermanZX> Its basically chaingun but on steroids
[3:59:50] <spidervenomized> yes
[3:59:51] <%cobalt_phoenix_> sorta
[3:59:53] <%Neoepochx> Test in prison yea?
[3:59:55] <Klarrann3> BFG is still better
[3:59:55] <Invertin> BFG fires 30 ammo per shot, this fires 1 ammo per shot
[3:59:56] <@Solidus_113> Unmakyr is better for single targets
[3:59:56] <%DesertPenguin> BFG is better for ammo
[4:00:01] <%LordDukeFishington> 1 bfg round = half the ammo of Unmaker
[4:00:01] <+CryptusMaximus> basically a concentrated BFG
[4:00:06] <RichochetForce> This is a boss killer.
[4:00:10] <RichochetForce> BFG clears rooms
[4:00:10] <brachydios777> It’s a big boy killer
[4:00:11] <Bodregg> the only thing unmakyr does better is killing single demons
[4:00:14] <%lewdskeletor13> HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT SAM
[4:00:15] <dinnydanny777> BFG machine gun
[4:00:19] <+greenfall> yup focused bfg shots
[4:00:21] <%cobalt_phoenix_> BFG: room clear, Unmaykr: fuck this one guy in particular
[4:00:22] <heart_ablaze> you can feel the arousal sam feels toward this gun
[4:00:22] <BlackermanZX> this gun RIPS single big targets
[4:00:23] <RahuHordika> Lore?
[4:00:24] <somekindaspy> HMMM wonder how sam knows that
[4:00:24] <raikagelord1> BFG is still better Sadly. Good for killing single targerts
[4:00:25] <+yamchadassist> 1BFG=30UNMAKYR
[4:00:29] <somekindaspy> just do it man
[4:00:30] <Tucker0603> boss killer where the BFG is crowd control
[4:00:30] <%Javaa01> Suits are the only things to pick up
[4:00:30] <RichochetForce> @lewdskeletor13 Yeah, Sam stops pretending at this point
[4:00:31] <somekindaspy> go to hell
[4:00:32] <+demegodz> Test in ripatorium?
[4:00:35] <+Ether101_Prime> Do they get what's happening yet? With Hyden being an angel?
[4:00:35] <%a_goth_pancake> rip and tear right to the bone
[4:00:38] <Crippl3> Did Woolie unlock the 2016 Costume? There's a Cheat Code in with it
[4:00:40] <%Irridium> this thing is REAL good for some bosses coming up
[4:00:46] <RichochetForce> @Ether101_Prime They understand.
[4:00:49] <dinnydanny777> no spoilers
[4:00:54] <anita_dickin> 1 BFG to 30 Unmayker
[4:01:01] <KeystoneA2> @Crippl3 Yes.
[4:01:01] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:01:07] <%DesertPenguin> BEcause sword is better than axe
[4:01:13] <%RueOrin> Unmaykr is GREAT against Marauders
[4:01:17] <%DesertPenguin> It's a lightsaber
[4:01:18] <%Neoepochx> Literally a light saber but metal
[4:01:19] <Shwepie> @WoolieVersus Unmaykr is the original concept for the BFG, it just caused to much lag to actually be pulled off in the good ol' days.
[4:01:20] <Crippl3> @KeystoneA2 nice
[4:01:28] <%tokenreefer> wooliePOYO
[4:01:33] <%DesertPenguin> Totally
[4:01:34] <brachydios777> I did not know this
[4:01:36] <@Solidus_113> IT'S LIKE DOOMGUY'S GUITAR
[4:01:38] <%DesertPenguin> You saw the Betrayer had an axe
[4:01:43] <somekindaspy> the betrayer had a hammer
[4:01:47] <%DesertPenguin> It's all the same aesthetic
[4:01:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> hammer
[4:01:47] <Bodregg> @WoolieVersus they did, look at the marauder axe and the betrayer hammer
[4:01:49] <peachy996> And Night Sentinels had spear
[4:01:51] <%lewdskeletor13> The Betrayer has a hammer variant
[4:01:52] <brachydios777> @desertpenguin Hammer
[4:02:01] <%DesertPenguin> IT's a hammer when the energy blades aren't out?
[4:02:01] <%a_goth_pancake> I want to swing that guitar around. hear it go *twang* when I chop demons
[4:02:01] <%Asuterisuku> Valen had an axe like it.
[4:02:02] <anita_dickin> the guitax
[4:02:02] <Tucker0603> the betrayer had A FUCKING HAMMER LIKE IT
[4:02:04] <RogueMinja> Betrayer's hammer.
[4:02:04] <spidervenomized> the axe
[4:02:05] <%Irridium> Betrayer had a hammer. you saw sentinals with spears, and marauder has an axe. and of course the guitar
[4:02:12] <+CryptusMaximus> I like how this game immediately tosses the 2016 crucible in the trash and gives you a different one
[4:02:15] <KeystoneA2> Imagine a mourning star made out of that thing
[4:02:19] <%a_goth_pancake> literal axe
[4:02:37] <RichochetForce> @CryptusMaximus The Demonic Crucible is part of something bigger.
[4:02:39] <%cobalt_phoenix_> we're going back to the whole "crazy lighsaber concepts" talk and I'm glad
[4:02:41] <%DesertPenguin> It's the Black Bow of Pharis' Weapon Arts lol
[4:02:45] <raikagelord1> One sentinel had a barraka blades.
[4:02:48] <+MajiOMNI> inhuman gun
[4:02:48] <DeathByPoke7> 2 human
[4:02:48] <%kyh9> The Human-Remover
[4:02:49] <%Neoepochx> Using the infinite ammo cheat with the unmaykr is pretty fun.
[4:02:51] <@Solidus_113> De-humanizer
[4:02:53] <$legacy0117> And Hammer. But that's Betrayer's weapon.
[4:02:53] <spidervenomized> @CryptusMaximus it still mention a prophecy of the one who wield it
[4:02:54] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Anti-personnel
[4:02:55] <%notsafeforpbs> notsafeforpbs subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! I noticed that the weapons' demo clips don't show the demons charging from all directions...They're mostly motionless...could that be sending misleading signals about the usefulness of each weapon?
[4:02:55] <DelgotHansto> MAN-UNKIND
[4:02:56] <SomersaultJustice> so any gun?
[4:02:56] <%Chatterbox1991> the humiliator
[4:02:57] <StarvingPenguinGod> Everyone would buy it LUL
[4:02:57] <+YabbaTroll> elf-grinder
[4:02:58] <+JustToWatch> THE UNWOOLIE
[4:02:59] <%vaderxyz1970> Inhumanizer
[4:03:00] <RichochetForce> Antihuman
[4:03:00] <ralph_90> if
[4:03:01] <Ozmodyas> The Un-Human-inator
[4:03:01] <+eanscrale> Inhuman
[4:03:02] <+MK_Ineptitude> IF Reggie were a human
[4:03:03] <CoffeeSlice> THE UNALIVER
[4:03:04] <+YabbaTroll> De-Meater
[4:03:04] <Invertin> @WoolieVersus it's a pun, the original gun was Unmaker
[4:03:05] <anita_dickin> kills bugs dead
[4:03:06] <dinnydanny777> You mean a "Peacemaker"?
[4:03:06] <%a_goth_pancake> dehumanize them, reg.
[4:03:06] <Bodregg> dehumanizer
[4:03:10] <%lewdskeletor13> Reggie is an AI
[4:03:12] <%GrassCannon> The Anti-Spiral
[4:03:13] <@Solidus_113> ANTI-PERSONNEL
[4:03:15] <@Solidus_113> IT EXISTS
[4:03:15] <%kyh9> The equation to undermining free will
[4:03:16] <dinnydanny777> Guns are already called peacemaker
[4:03:16] <brachydios777> Like Human Extinction Attack?
[4:03:16] <%Chatterbox1991> Widowmaker
[4:03:19] <%kyh9> The ANTI MONITOR
[4:03:19] <%Neoepochx> Anti-Life Equation is terrifying.
[4:03:22] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus an anti human gun is called the "problem solver"
[4:03:23] <KeystoneA2> UnMan
[4:03:27] <SovPho> it's not a great gun
[4:03:27] <Crippl3> To the basement!
[4:03:27] <peachy996> Un-Thing and Big Fuckin Gun
[4:03:31] <dinnydanny777> Guns are already called peacemakers by the way
[4:03:31] <$legacy0117> That is called as GUASSFLAYER.
[4:03:32] <RichochetForce> @Solidus_113 Anti-Personnel/Anti-Infantry weapons are brutal
[4:03:36] <+CryptusMaximus> @RichochetForce Well obviously it still has plot relevance but I'm talking gameplay
[4:03:36] <RogueMinja> It uses up ammo that you can't get back.
[4:03:37] <ElkRiverDog> No Longer Human gun
[4:03:40] <%a_goth_pancake> de-veganizing day *woom woom*
[4:03:41] <%lewdskeletor13> ANTI-LIFE EQUATION: THE DEATH THAT IS LIFE
[4:03:42] <+YabbaTroll> Infantry Fighting Vehicle
[4:03:46] <BlackermanZX> @WoolieVersus unmayker is useful agains BIG targets or bosses
[4:03:47] <+MajiOMNI> ammo cheat
[4:03:50] <SovPho> BFG outclasses Unmaykr in almost every situation from what I recall.
[4:03:51] <RichochetForce> @CryptusMaximus Oh of course, the crucible runs circles around it.
[4:03:57] <Ozmodyas> Does the Ripatorium actually use up ammo?
[4:03:58] <+yendoria> The Dehumaniser?
[4:04:02] <+TheNeonGraveyard> Detroit: Become Unhuman
[4:04:03] <dinnydanny777> A peacemaker is a word used to refer to a gun, it makes peace
[4:04:10] <%kyh9> The Anti Life equation is literally the platonic ideal of servitude
[4:04:10] <RichochetForce> BFG is for clearing rooms. Unmaykr is for bosses.
[4:04:14] <%DesertPenguin> Detroit: Unbecome Human
[4:04:16] <%a_goth_pancake> dead
[4:04:22] <@Solidus_113> it's kinda silly in DOom 64
[4:04:24] <%LordDukeFishington> go to mission select and use infinite ammo cheat
[4:04:25] <%FuqBoiSlim> the ripperroonie doesnt use up your ammo I believe
[4:04:27] <somekindaspy> in doom 64 it was basically ridiculous
[4:04:27] <spidervenomized> it was much more stronger
[4:04:28] <%mitchteck> Use in mission reload save
[4:04:29] <%Asuterisuku> Ripatotium doesn't restore BFG and Crucible ammo.
[4:04:32] <+Ether101_Prime> The original idea for the Unmaker was that it was the anti-demon weapon that would have different effects on enemies depending on how demonic they are.
[4:04:34] <somekindaspy> I wanna drive that Atlan
[4:04:34] <%Neoepochx> In 64 you had to power it up using keys.
[4:04:34] <RichochetForce> @FuqBoiSlim Oh, you're right
[4:04:35] <%FuqBoiSlim> nvm
[4:04:36] <Diana869> Total Life Obliteration
[4:04:40] <%Irridium> DOOM 64 you had to upgrade it. but when you did whoo boy
[4:04:47] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus can you enable cheats from the pause menu?
[4:04:48] <+CryptusMaximus> Doom 64 had a new level added to it just to connect better to this game
[4:04:50] <%lewdskeletor13> Can you outrun the Omega Sanction little man? The life that is death?
[4:04:51] <%Neoepochx> You have infinite ammo cheat no?
[4:04:59] <BlackermanZX> @WoolieVersus it was called the Unmaker before iirc
[4:05:03] <+paladinstarbuster> he found it
[4:05:06] <somekindaspy> it was a demonic weapon originally
[4:05:09] <%a_goth_pancake> doomguy, unstoppable demon slaying juggernaut, wielder of the demon crucible, king of the night sentinels, savior of humanity... died talking down some stairs Kappa
[4:05:12] <%lewdskeletor13> Time travel wonky space
[4:05:16] <$legacy0117> So, I have NOT seen anything past this. Soooo, this'll be fun.
[4:05:18] <somekindaspy> be sure to kill the archvile
[4:05:29] <somekindaspy> because he will spawn demons all over your ship
[4:05:37] <%SuperKirby24> Kreygasm SourPls Kreygasm
[4:05:38] <%TheREALGirthMan> Unmaykr go BRRRRRRRRR
[4:05:40] <%DesertPenguin> AAAAAAAAAAAAND IT'S GONE
[4:05:41] <Tha_Mik> Done
[4:05:43] <whazat> it burns through ammo
[4:05:45] <@Solidus_113> it's much better for BIG single targets
[4:05:47] <%a_goth_pancake> shoot gun
[4:05:48] <%DesertPenguin> Such ca waste
[4:05:48] <RichochetForce> Yeah
[4:05:49] <Bodregg> already gone LUL
[4:05:49] <whazat> BFG is definitely easier to use
[4:05:51] <dinnydanny777> It's a rapid fire Wookie bowcaster
[4:05:53] <RichochetForce> It's a boss killer
[4:05:53] <KeystoneA2> melts heavies for when you got no Crucible
[4:05:53] <%a_goth_pancake> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[4:05:55] <anita_dickin> unmayker go brrrrr ammo go down
[4:05:55] <BlackermanZX> Its a Boss Melter
[4:05:55] <$legacy0117> Sword ammo here too bois.
[4:05:56] <%DesertPenguin> A single BFG shot would have killed them and you'd be more sure of it
[4:05:59] <%lewdskeletor13> Gotta save it for them big boys
[4:05:59] <memes_are_cancer> Minigun's older brother basically
[4:06:03] <peachy996> You kinda have to aim the BFG
[4:06:04] <Tucker0603> it fucks bosses up
[4:06:05] <dinnydanny777> It's a machine gun Wookie bowcaster
[4:06:13] <%Neoepochx> Lives aren't consumed in the prison.
[4:06:13] <%DesertPenguin> That's not supposed to use your extra lives
[4:06:14] <somekindaspy> you have infinite lives here
[4:06:16] <%DesertPenguin> It doesn't use your ammo wtf
[4:06:21] <%DesertPenguin> Does that count?
[4:06:24] <+Posichronic> BFG melts whole arenas.
[4:06:33] <somekindaspy> he'll get all his armor and ammo back after he leaves
[4:06:33] <%cobalt_phoenix_> I just wish you could get more bfg/unmaykr ammo in levels
[4:06:33] <Crippl3> Ripatorium doesn't take your lives AFAIK
[4:06:34] <somekindaspy> it's good
[4:06:35] <%lewdskeletor13> The Ripatorium shouldn’t consume your lives
[4:06:39] <%cobalt_phoenix_> like 2016
[4:06:41] <%Neoepochx> It does not consume lives.
[4:06:45] <Ner234> bbrrrrrr
[4:06:45] <%a_goth_pancake> no lives were lost in this ripping and tearing.
[4:06:46] <KeystoneA2> delet
[4:06:50] <+TheNeonGraveyard> LIKE BUTTA
[4:06:51] <%DesertPenguin> If you die and have no extra lives, then what?
[4:06:52] <%Asuterisuku> @desertpenguin Super weapon ammo isn't restored here.
[4:07:04] <somekindaspy> @Asuterisuku wait, for real?
[4:07:05] <evil_doru> judgement cut
[4:07:05] <%a_goth_pancake> lol wut tyrant?
[4:07:17] <umbrellaswereawesome> Ripatorium basically infintely respawns you until you kill everything, I believe.
[4:07:19] <%Klefth> BFG division is too fucking good
[4:07:23] <%Josef_Stryker> Carcuses are still the fucking worst
[4:07:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> SourPls
[4:07:44] <%DesertPenguin> Still has 2 extra lives. That wasted one, that sucks
[4:07:44] <+Posichronic> @DesertPenguin you die irl
[4:07:49] <%scrublord009> Djent Division Kreygasm
[4:08:01] <TheAmazingClaytor> Aw.
[4:08:01] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:08:01] <%DesertPenguin> That really sucks that it used up an extra life when you didn't need to go down there
[4:08:03] <DelgotHansto> Fucking imagine DOOMGUYS JUDGEMENT CUT END
[4:08:03] <+CryptusMaximus> Must be a special feeling to be the last low level demon in an arena as Doom Slayer is actively searching for you
[4:08:03] <RichochetForce> They share ammo
[4:08:04] <%Neoepochx> @DesertPenguin He had 2 lives only when he went in.
[4:08:05] <somekindaspy> man that sucks
[4:08:06] <anita_dickin> ammo go down
[4:08:07] <Tha_Mik> It's ok
[4:08:07] <%DesertPenguin> He had 3
[4:08:09] <%DesertPenguin> It went down to 2
[4:08:10] <somekindaspy> BFG is better
[4:08:12] <$legacy0117> Nowwww, cut that sword from different angles and watch some magic happen.
[4:08:15] <%lewdskeletor13> breebuD
[4:08:19] <peachy996> I like the BFG more

[4:08:32] <%DesertPenguin> LUL
[4:08:32] <+MajiOMNI> Unmaykr is a bonus gun
[4:08:35] <SjoeB89> BFG and sword are both way better
[4:08:35] <+TheBigTaco> BFG had more ease of use
[4:08:37] <%lewdskeletor13> LUL
[4:08:38] <%Neoepochx> Got some ARC

[4:10:01] <dinnydanny777> I am Eternally unhappy with having heard that

[4:10:04] <%DesertPenguin> One mission per stream from here on out
[4:10:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that was a good stream
[4:10:05] <Bodregg> i can't believe you would end the stream on such a terrible note
[4:10:07] <blamematazz> ResidentSleeper
[4:10:13] <%FuqBoiSlim> Go home everyone
[4:10:13] <%a_goth_pancake> sigh

[4:10:26] <%Klefth> Reggie, please slap this man's hand
[4:10:29] <Bodregg> i'm unsubscribing from Vinesauce: The Full Sauce
[4:10:30] <somekindaspy> that was a very long level
[4:10:32] <%lewdskeletor13> I can see DMC saying that
[4:10:35] <%DesertPenguin> I'm unsubbing from Clemps
[4:10:37] <SovPho> Khanmaykr aka "King Maker" isn't exactly a subtle name for God anyways.
[4:10:39] <+greenfall> the next level nekrovol is pretty meaty too
[4:10:41] <$legacy0117> YEAH...
[4:10:41] <%a_goth_pancake> you know doomguy, we really are the doom eternal
[4:10:43] <%TheREALGirthMan> Woolie when you get to heaven can you ask God why he gave me a micropenis please and thank you
[4:11:01] <+DukeBlack_> Satan is a seraph
[4:11:08] <somekindaspy> Fun fact: in the art book the demons call Samuel "The Lucent Defiler"
[4:11:09] <%DesertPenguin> This is what Woolie Vs. God has been leading up to this whole time
[4:11:11] <0rond> you know, samuel in the bible is known as a king maker, he is the one that made david a king
[4:11:11] <BlacSoul> the look on reggies face
[4:11:14] <@Solidus_113> Seraphim
[4:11:27] <somekindaspy> and say "his breath smells not of man"
[4:11:32] <+DukeBlack_> seraphim is plural
[4:11:33] <$legacy0117> Lucificer was an ArchAngel buddy.
[4:11:34] <%DesertPenguin> Eh
[4:11:38] <+paladinstarbuster> uh
[4:11:40] <CoffeeSlice> wh
[4:11:42] <umbrellaswereawesome> wut
[4:11:45] <$legacy0117> Top of the top.
[4:11:47] <+DukeBlack_> Lucifer is made up from Paradise lost.
[4:11:48] <%DesertPenguin> It's a simple example to give you an idea
[4:11:49] <+Checktrap> POINT ZERO REGGIE !!!!!!
[4:11:56] <%a_goth_pancake> woolie vs satan let's go
[4:11:57] <+Posichronic> The satan thing was a red herring for that game too on the nose
[4:12:02] <%DesertPenguin> You just wanna know what it do
[4:12:03] <$legacy0117> Pfft.
[4:12:04] <Tha_Mik> What the weapon does
[4:12:04] <peachy996> It's a weapon demo
[4:12:16] <%DesertPenguin> Shut down
[4:12:20] <RichochetForce> Monster Hunter is the same
[4:12:33] <RichochetForce> You see weapon use against largely potato monsters.
[4:12:34] <$legacy0117> Bible. Paradise lost not.
[4:12:50] <Bodregg> reminder that the crucible (the one that sam got, not yours) is a source of argent energy that doesn't require that you have to go to hell, sam has discovered vegan hell drugs
[4:12:51] <%DesertPenguin> Do we know Punchmom's name or is it one of those lore things?
[4:12:58] <@Solidus_113> it's Stef
[4:13:04] <%Asuterisuku> Eternal is a character action game in 1st person.
[4:13:08] <RichochetForce> Taras Nabad is no joke
[4:13:11] <%DesertPenguin> Punchmom sounds cooler lol
[4:13:12] <RichochetForce> Great stream
[4:13:13] <+DukeBlack_> Lucifer is never mentioned in the bible as an angel. It was a title for the king of Babylon
[4:13:18] <peachy996> No
[4:13:19] <%SuperKirby24> GITR DUN
[4:13:19] <%Javaa01> Hell no you won't
[4:13:22] <+JustToWatch> No way
[4:13:22] <peachy996> No you won't
[4:13:24] <somekindaspy> @DukeBlack_ is accurate
[4:13:24] <Tha_Mik> Maybe 2 more
[4:13:24] <+kraajkase> Hell no
[4:13:24] <+greenfall> big nope
[4:13:25] <CoffeeSlice> naw
[4:13:25] <Calek> oh you're not beating it saturday 100%
[4:13:27] <%Irridium> you will NOT git'r done
[4:13:29] <%DesertPenguin> 3 or 4 more streams
[4:13:30] <peachy996> 3 More Session
[4:13:30] <RichochetForce> Nope
[4:13:32] <%lewdskeletor13> You’ve got 3 more levels
[4:13:32] <%ekodrop> woolie ain't remember what pat said
[4:13:34] <RichochetForce> 3-4 more streams
[4:13:35] <+CryptusMaximus> Probably not. You average one level a stream
[4:13:36] <Bodregg> 3-4 more streams at your pace
[4:13:36] <somekindaspy> Story DLC for Doom Eternal will be a full-on new campaign, btw. With new weapons and new demons.
[4:13:38] <Monkeyweed21> 4 more levels
[4:13:39] <%DesertPenguin> 3-4
[4:13:40] <$legacy0117> You never touched a Bible apparently.
[4:13:43] <umbrellaswereawesome> Looking forward to Nekroval!
[4:13:44] <%Asuterisuku> 4 levels to go.
[4:13:46] <%a_goth_pancake> I can't wait until woolie gets to the end of this game and doomguy does through the portal and Samuel goes "doomguy, you mind telling me what you're doing on that ship?" and doomguy goes "unf". then we wait three more years to finish the story.
[4:13:48] <%DesertPenguin> UNO!!!
[4:13:54] <somekindaspy> Nekravol ftw
[4:14:08] <%DesertPenguin> Nekroval*
[4:14:08] <somekindaspy> yo the music will be lit
[4:14:08] <$legacy0117> Nekravol coming up.
[4:14:21] <%a_goth_pancake> the only thing they fear is yooooooooou
[4:14:35] <Bodregg> i can't wait until the end of the game and woolie sees the cutscene where doomguy professes his eternal love for sam
[4:14:46] <@Solidus_113> I'm happy with it
[4:15:00] <Calek> @Bodregg that's why it's called Doom Eternal, I get it now
[4:15:02] <%Chatterbox1991> @solidus_113 well done
[4:15:02] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:15:07] <%DesertPenguin> Thanks solidus
[4:15:09] <%Irridium> @Bodregg best kiss in gaming
[4:15:21] <Bodregg> khan maykr was a red herring to distract from the real love interest
[4:15:28] <%Asuterisuku> Skullgirls never clicked with me but I appreciate it for what it is.
[4:15:34] <%a_goth_pancake> Samuel was the real waifu all along.

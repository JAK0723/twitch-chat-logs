[0:11:04] <CrmznOgre> Grievous is why I have a foot fetish.
[0:11:10] <DXLelouch24> im pretty sure the distructo disk would of just bounced off of Cell

[0:11:40] <%DatAsuna> Remember the instant transmission from the droidekas?
[0:11:42] <%Baxterj7> cheer500 I have been loving this series as a huge Star Wars and KOTR fan. Just a question, are either of you fans of the Expanded Universe Novels (Or Legends if you go with the lame Disney label lol) ? If so, have a favorite book?
[0:11:42] <%gatorafan> Darth Corpse (empty)
[0:11:48] <Ahk_90> Everything great in Star Wars came from outside the movies, change my mind

[0:12:22] <OldManDeckardCain> grievous was black before he was a robot Kappa
[0:12:23] <%DatAsuna> Big disagree lol
[0:12:28] <AntChodeny> Gendi also has Jedi Master Shaggy
[0:12:31] <%augusm> Wait has it not started?? Thank fuckkkk
[0:12:39] <+hoenhime344> you only need to watch like...17 ep of the ENTIER clones wars show.... you dont need to watch the whole thing
[0:12:43] <MasterDecoder> R.I.P. Grievous' Legends backstory
[0:12:43] <%DatAsuna> That clearly made him not doomguy tho
[0:12:44] <Pseudonymity> 2d > 3d . it is known
[0:13:05] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's ethical slavery guys :)
[0:13:08] <theKingRamses> jigglin for the greater good
[0:13:08] <Redblood801> You gotta go get your money since you leveled up.

[0:15:39] <allenpie04> back it up
[0:15:42] <@Squdnate> @Manderson1998 I would recommend it, as KOTOR2 spoils 1 quite hard, because they go back to the events at times
[0:15:52] <+gustavozxd> well I gotta go watch that cause i gotta follow the playthrough lol
[0:15:52] <allenpie04> baaaAAAck it uo

[0:17:16] <joylent_blue> i'm sure there are fanfics that are better written
[0:17:23] <Mvrdok_> If that one reddit leak was true, fuck Disney
[0:17:23] <OldManDeckardCain> sequel writing is so bad it rivals light novel writing LUL
[0:17:23] <+firmlygraspi1> you're not getting the full experience unless you read Twitter in the theater
[0:17:25] <%augusm> What were the tweets?
[0:17:25] <%bread_assassin> Hey, Force Awakens is one of the better Star Wars movies.
[0:17:26] <+Muzzle131> Boyega should of been the main character
[0:17:27] <GarbageNirvana> My favorite part of the sequel trilogy is how they don't explain anything
[0:17:27] <clack14> joylent_blue most likely.
[0:17:29] <+glgzephyr> I mean we got some decent soundtracks out of it, so it wasn't a complete loss
[0:17:41] <Windermelon> disney literally said that "The expanded universe isn't canon to our films" which can *totally* be interpreted as....
[0:17:42] <+captainpodock> 7 had promise
[0:17:44] <+Ozymandias555> I love the new Trilogy. Really weird how it’s episodic on Disney+ and called the Mandalorian tho.

[0:18:37] <%augusm> @windermelon Remember that Disney fucked up and realised a lot of the extended universe stuff is better than anything they can come up with
[0:18:42] <+MasterGeneralVic> like Liam neason hunting people
[0:18:43] <allenpie04> are we the bad guys?
[0:18:45] <Valentinius_Anodyne> No it's just art :)
[0:18:51] <NZolozabal> @Windermelon "We'll cherry pick certain aspects of the EU and pass it off as our own."
[0:18:54] <%DatAsuna> They're not evil, they just want to "balance the budget"
[0:18:59] <Redblood801> FUCK CZERKA
[0:19:00] <Fujiwara_92> we them light side bois making some noise LUL
[0:19:07] <Psyramics> Reminder that the Exec Producer for Stars Wars movies said it was so much harder not having anything to draw from like the Marvel does
[0:19:11] <+glgzephyr> @DatAsuna SPACE POLITICS
[0:19:12] <Joestar1890> BTFO Corpos!
[0:19:23] <+thebonebard> looks like fanny is lining his pack with morality
[0:19:28] <Maleicus> its not even that good of a money
[0:19:29] <joylent_blue> never trust anyone who says it "ama-tours"
[0:19:33] <Windermelon> @augusm @NZolozabal Passion always outweighs moni
[0:19:35] <%bread_assassin> Those statues are bowing to the minimum wage front desk clerk.
[0:19:35] <+tearknack> i kind of wish woolie wasn't going in planning one way or another
[0:19:40] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @psyramics *stupidity intensifies*
[0:19:40] <iamyungdannow> Can you turn up the game a little? @woolieversus
[0:19:41] <muniea3> fill your pockets by looting their corpses
[0:19:49] <Mordexai0> awww. We're doing dark side? Light side is kinda better here
[0:19:49] <@Commando_Joe> Damn filthy Mirialans rooGun
[0:19:55] <abelincoln_catpuncher> game audio is a tad low
[0:20:01] <Joestar1890> Fann Y' fills his pack with good boy points
[0:20:14] <Fujiwara_92> Kreia just hanging out with an axe LUL
[0:20:23] <%augusm> @windermelon What? Are you implying that Disney cares more about passion than money?
[0:20:40] <allenpie04> oh the poor rich
[0:20:47] <Djinnazz> that's still the option
[0:20:56] <clack14> never help the poor, they will die anyways.
[0:21:04] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Objectively, the best option is to fill those pockets
[0:21:08] <Windermelon> @augusm no i'm rationalizing how a company with infinite resources and a private military can possibly produce garbage from the most popular ip in the world
[0:21:09] <%bread_assassin> Apparently the outcasts survive and find their promised land.
[0:21:09] <Tucker0603> it's in SWTOR
[0:21:09] <%DatAsuna> It doesn't go that way, but they suffer a way worse fate
[0:21:10] <@Commando_Joe> A bunch of them survived
[0:21:12] <NZolozabal> Reading through the Thrawn trilogy myself. Starting book two.
[0:21:18] <%JJCheeker> Tax the poor
[0:21:25] <%DatAsuna> It's a bad place to live
[0:21:27] <Tucker0603> the cities got FUCKING RUINED THOUGH
[0:21:28] <Psyramics> Woolie, you literally saw it happen. Telos is the tutorial planet from KOTOR1
[0:21:38] <%DatAsuna> The planet survives
[0:21:39] <manwithaxe> it got fucked in a way more efficient way than a death star
[0:21:40] <%augusm> @windermelon Ah right, I misunderstood my bad
[0:21:41] <theKingRamses> it is still melting
[0:21:42] <Fujiwara_92> Fidan Gilfa
[0:21:42] <+glgzephyr> @NZolozabal Enjoy. Thrawn is the best Star Wars villain
[0:21:44] <+thebonebard> the rock is actually teeming with life
[0:21:48] <Windermelon> no prob dude
[0:21:53] <+thebonebard> the place is super overgrown
[0:21:57] <+SolidusRex> @Psyramics Taris =/= Telos
[0:21:58] <+blastazoid26> I havent been keeping up with this. Is woolie good or bad on this run?
[0:22:04] <+glgzephyr> we good guys
[0:22:05] <siamzero94> @Psyramics no it isn't. telos is carth's homeplanet
[0:22:06] <+tearknack> "good"
[0:22:07] <+MrMoonGoose> good
[0:22:11] <@Commando_Joe> He's good-ish @blastazoid26
[0:22:11] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @psyramics no the tutorial is on Taris
[0:22:11] <+Ozymandias555> Space Jesus
[0:22:12] <NoirXTX> The poor actually escaped the destruction of the planet. Though they ended up pretty unlucky all the same.
[0:22:14] <%DatAsuna> @manwithaxe literally tho, every star destroyer can do that harder than malak's ship
[0:22:14] <muniea3> it's still good
[0:22:18] <%JJCheeker> This place was only mentioned in the first game
[0:22:19] <DSD24> Good with some dark side outcomes here or there
[0:22:19] <KnivesEve> we light boys now'
[0:22:20] <%DatAsuna> The death star is so redundant
[0:22:22] <+Rolandknight> Who is his co host today?
[0:22:24] <clack14> Space jesus for space jam
[0:22:29] <+blastazoid26> Cool, thanks guys
[0:22:31] <+MrMoonGoose> chaotic good, I'd say
[0:22:33] <tacostarvedbeast> Don’t they glass half the planet and if u help the exiled move to the other half?
[0:22:34] <%DatAsuna> Also there was no explosion when you flew away
[0:22:38] <+tearknack> @blastazoid26 allegedly good, but a dm would have already marked him down as evil cause he currently owns a slave
[0:22:41] <@Commando_Joe> His co-host is Little V Mills https://www.youtube.com/user/LittleVMills
[0:22:51] <Windermelon> @DatAsuna can it even move? or do they just pend forever building a space station for a single star system
[0:22:55] <%DatAsuna> Also also Malak implies he's using a whole fleet to bomb it, but the FMV only shows one ship
[0:22:56] <+tearknack> @MrMoonGoose chaotic good...........he owns a slave
[0:22:59] <+blastazoid26> "Good" is relative
[0:23:07] <%DatAsuna> @Windermelon The death star moves
[0:23:07] <+tearknack> not in star wars
[0:23:11] <clack14> how many does woolie have?

[0:34:34] <%RioGascar> Or am thinking this is deeper than it is
[0:34:38] <%krispen_wa> Eww dex
[0:34:48] <%DatAsuna> he does play pazaak nonstop in his head

[0:34:59] <%krispen_wa> Don't tell anyone you leveled it
[0:35:06] <%DatAsuna> would be if you read atton's mind and it was just the sound effects for pazaak
[0:35:07] <GreyRavyn15> What ever happened to Darth Pockets?!
[0:35:18] <jorniev> I MISSED THE MASTERS TEACHINGS
[0:35:23] <%RioGascar> Oh yeah doesnt he think about pazaak constantly
[0:35:25] <RyuuAoi> FUCKING RICH PPL
[0:35:25] <Tucker0603> SWTOR has SOOOO much fasion
[0:35:40] <jorniev> little V is that outfit confy?
[0:35:43] <%krispen_wa> Too bad the market prices are inflated as fuck for fashion
[0:35:45] <+SolidusRex> More like Lopak Slut
[0:35:50] <%DatAsuna> I spend a lot of time on SWTOR just doing fashion stuff lol
[0:36:15] <%RioGascar> I spent decent time in star wars galaxy doing fashion
[0:36:19] <%RioGascar> then it died
[0:36:30] <%DatAsuna> The ther thing I would give swtor tho, it has fun stories in it's own right. People just overly fixate on references to kotor instead of giving it's original stuff a chance.
[0:36:46] <%DatAsuna> tbf fashion is easier on private servers now than when it was live
[0:36:47] <%krispen_wa> SWTOR would be amazing if it wasn't a sequel to KOTOR
[0:36:47] <Maleicus> i dont know whats so illegal about it
[0:36:51] <manwithaxe> what could you do to a blaster to make it illegal?
[0:36:54] <Maleicus> its not even a strong gun
[0:36:55] <+SlappyMeats> it's been outfitted with a BABY DISINTEGRATOR
[0:36:56] <%krispen_wa> and if KOTFE and KOTET didn't exist
[0:36:59] <manwithaxe> make it too good
[0:37:03] <%RioGascar> oh no a gun that kills
[0:37:08] <%RioGascar> We made it kill better
[0:37:13] <%RioGascar> oh god
[0:37:14] <%ChoculaUltra> speaking of swtor, this mask Woolie is wearing is giving huge Arcann vibes
[0:37:21] <%DatAsuna> I like the potential of KotFE, KotET flushes the chances it had to pull it off
[0:37:22] <%RioGascar> The tsf is just a tsa parody arent they
[0:37:23] <manwithaxe> are lightsabers illegal to these people
[0:37:33] <%DatAsuna> Ideally KotFE would have been ME2 x 40
[0:37:41] <%DatAsuna> Building a huge team, doing loyalty missions
[0:37:44] <%RioGascar> lightsabers are classified as self defense
[0:37:46] <AdmiralCheeseburger> Wacky waving inflatable arm flailing CRIME man
[0:38:00] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @BallerSwagBro9k
[0:38:03] <%RioGascar> and what if a gang of people with babyskulls is running around
[0:38:03] <%krispen_wa> The only thing good in KOTFE was getting to kill that bitch Kaliyo

[0:39:01] <%DatAsuna> note: when I say great character I do not mean good person
[0:39:17] <%RioGascar> look if a video game really wants to win
[0:39:23] <%RioGascar> just kill you when your sleeping
[0:39:25] <%krispen_wa> Kaliyo is a great way to write a murderous psychopath.
[0:39:27] <%RioGascar> or in menus
[0:39:34] <%krispen_wa> Which is why I wanted to kill her the minute she joined my agent

[1:11:52] <lotharrio> Woolie is light side. That's why he's killing cops and wearing Sith body armor.
[1:11:55] <%DatAsuna> disregard the sith clothes
[1:11:59] <%CrimsonCore90> CrimsonCore90 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! Woolie what supports you more? Watching like 2 week old videos or Subscribing at streams. In short my career doesn't allow me to do both.
[1:12:06] <mattynezz> I think the best Strength Underlay is +4/+4
[1:12:11] <cr0wdcontrol> Become sith

[2:18:23] <privatesargent> ithorians don't lie, they untruth
[2:18:24] <SnaKemuho> "untruth" is a nice term
[2:18:24] <+glgzephyr> Geralt is gray as it gets
[2:18:25] <ZeeJiggle> I like that. Untruth.
[2:18:25] <ScreamLord> @wydamn And the Switch version will be the default best version because it's portable AND has DMC4/5 style switching
[2:18:43] <+glgzephyr> Yennefer is closer to a dark jedi than Geralt is
[2:18:55] <PROUD2beGINGER> I love the [Lie] in this game

[2:19:16] <lotharrio> Geralt is: Fuck you, pay me.
[2:19:18] <%Rodyle2> Geralt says he is gray but is actually has serial heroism
[2:19:20] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Need to grease some palms, and my hands are pretty dry right npw
[2:19:20] <CruxAustralis> Fann Y'Pak joins the mafia
[2:19:22] <brandt_connors> Is he saving up Atton's levels for reasons?

[2:19:28] <wydamn> Gotta grease some palm... trees
[2:19:30] <+GeneralHysterics> @BurdRightsActivist you mean his desire to serve the GREATER GOOD?
[2:19:35] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[2:19:36] <ScreamLord> @abelincoln_catpuncher DMC3 for the Switch will have style switching like in DMC4 and 5

[2:20:49] <+Troispoint> poison worms omg
[2:20:50] <BurdRightsActivist> @GeneralHysterics I'm all for the greater good, but you know bruddha, we jedi don't exactly have material possesions eh? I'm not sayin I don't need the money, but what I'm sayin is that a jedi would apprecaite the money, brudha

[2:28:27] <+tearknack> @WoolieVersus there was also a BOOK called the last jedi, and force heal was already a thing
[2:28:28] <+kyh9> Also, Bioware stole Kreia, made her young and hot and called her Morrigan in Dragon Age ORigins
[2:28:28] <+glgzephyr> force heal has been around since Jedi Knight II
[2:28:34] <Redblood801> The Last Jedi movie is just Off brand Diet KOTOR 2
[2:28:40] <Some_Dude_Named_Caillou> Disney loves Kotor

[2:29:00] <TimetodiveLTX> tbh force teleport-objects is the hypest force ability

[0:00:02] <binkarus> I wanna see Minh in a one piece
[0:00:19] <%Solidnick18> alright
[0:00:19] <$legacy0117> Reggie, the next step you need to take is to raise your Ike strong to Guts strong!
[0:00:21] <binkarus> sugu modorushimasu
[0:00:26] <NeroInfinite> that APEX CONFIG
[0:00:40] <~WoolieVersus> give us a minute
[0:00:41] <%Binary_Fireball> woolie should use half a switch controller if he's gonna dual wield
[0:00:52] <pappyvanpoodle> its a moose
[0:01:14] <Riottrio> okay, so relevant to the controller stuff. I sometimes feel the need to take off my clothes to poop - and THAT IS WAY CRAZIER than Woolies controller hybrid apex config
[0:01:33] <Riottrio> So I am on the same level as pat, but I'm aware of the craziness
[0:01:55] <$legacy0117> Yes, and the issue is Pat does not understand that fact.
[0:02:02] <Theravingjesus> I gotta say removing the lower half of clothing is the way forward while pooping
[0:02:03] <@Solidus_113> MAGFest finally uploaded the Woolie/Eyepatch panel https://youtu.be/PjxMRtry_aE
[0:02:16] <chambatron> Woolie didn't get a code for ff7?
[0:02:23] <%rubbishbinge> The controller thing is upsetting, the taking of call your clothes to poop is actually crazy
[0:02:28] <Riottrio> @Theravingjesus sometimes I just go to poop and i'm like "I'm totally gonna have a sweaty back, better take off my shirt too"
[0:02:28] <Vohs_Bru> most crazy people dont realize that they are crazy
[0:02:31] <%rubbishbinge> all*
[0:02:46] <RacistWakka> wait they're going to play again?
[0:03:12] <$legacy0117> They are fixing an audio issue and taking a quick break.
[0:03:27] <Theravingjesus> @riottrio sometimes it gets real in there and there's no other choice
[0:03:28] <$legacy0117> I think.
[0:03:47] <%Livelinne> !uptime
[0:03:47] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 9 minutes
[0:03:56] <$legacy0117> Yepppp.
[0:04:24] <Riottrio> Hey, reggie. We love you
[0:04:32] <%Livelinne> Hiiiii bleedPurple
[0:04:40] <Vohs_Bru> Yellow guys!
[0:05:26] <jevichrono> The troubles
[0:05:30] <%MaddyCaddy> Dogs can't get it
[0:05:36] <jevichrono> But cats are at risk
[0:05:42] <Riottrio> Indoor cats are already isolating, so just have an indoor cat
[0:05:48] <royb2> That's a pretty alarmist statement. The cats can get infected by covid-19 but so far none have died of it
[0:05:52] <%GenesisKnight> Tell Pat to protect Elmo
[0:05:58] <binkarus> 次回、レジの雪辱
[0:06:01] <Vohs_Bru> cat in a box
[0:06:03] <sexdrugsvideogames> yoyoyo
[0:06:06] <royb2> Dogs are not suspectible to the disease but can in rare cases get it
[0:06:09] <Riottrio> Elmo doesn't go outside, so Elmo will be fine
[0:06:11] <SetsuRyuu> cats can get covid19 but they show no symptons and don't pass it to humans, it's what I saw in tests
[0:06:29] <Vohs_Bru> converging 2 0
[0:06:43] <SetsuRyuu> they like forced a bunch of the virus in the kitties
[0:06:53] <djazo> mortal shell looks great tho
[0:06:55] <royb2> @SetsuRyuu Cats can get symptomatic. Bronx tigers and a housecat in Belgium got sick. Also chinese animal tests showed that cats can transmit it to other cats
[0:07:02] <sexdrugsvideogames> Minh is the marauder

[0:07:25] <%SirGO0SE> Reggie sittin there like "I AINT WEARIN NO DRESS"
[0:07:28] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus how about loser has to eat a ghost pepper, in honour of Hot Pepper Gaming
[0:07:32] <binkarus> Loser should buy leather shoes and shine them for the others
[0:07:36] <%chiluzza> THE CUBE CONTAINS ALL
[0:07:36] <%supersugoisenpai1> Cube is more embarassing
[0:07:38] <+gratedjuice> The loser changes their name
[0:07:40] <%jiggy_snipe> stop breaking kayfabe
[0:07:50] <TheArrow_> if you say so
[0:07:53] <+MrRabbles> the cube fear was a lie BibleThump
[0:07:53] <jevichrono> Kayfabe broken
[0:08:04] <%MaddyCaddy> Eat a spoonful of Wasabi
[0:08:04] <gunsrlove> No shame? Go naked then Kappa
[0:08:07] <SetsuRyuu> @royb2 it's probably rare if there was another test showing the opposite. Tons of tests will still go around studying this
[0:08:07] <Riottrio> Woolie laid in garbage, a dress is nothing

[0:08:30] <Xeno351> REGGIE SUPER CARES

[0:10:09] <%NWannabe> Reginald the Frightened must die
[0:10:16] <+MrRabbles> Reggie is the hero of this stream leave him alone BibleThump
[0:10:24] <Riottrio> Reggie is a sweetheart
[0:10:25] <@Solidus_113> you need POWER
[0:10:26] <Junkles> yeah darkling is part of the game
[0:10:28] <%andrei11dr> Also fuck over the towns more
[0:10:29] <%jiggy_snipe> release the good boy limiters
[0:10:30] <topendbuzza> sack up reg
[0:10:31] <+Kduff89> instead of countering just wake up super and say "do you want me to be a woman?" and then hand them your number
[0:10:32] <%Irridium> quit bein' a coward
[0:10:40] <chambatron> Lawyer up, suit up and hit the gym Reggie
[0:10:41] <jevichrono> Ultra Minhstinct was trained on everyday occurrence
[0:10:44] <yeetdabsenpai69> YOU GOT ALMOST NOTHING!
[0:10:48] <binkarus> As long as you have 0 towns, the darkling is *VERY* worth it
[0:10:50] <%Solidnick18> ok punchmom
[0:10:54] <binkarus> which you did at the time
[0:10:54] <%NWannabe> Ya scurred boi. You don't want no smoke, stop wooliesplaining
[0:10:59] <yeetdabsenpai69> WHAT DO YOU EVEN HAVE?!
[0:11:07] <%andrei11dr> You're still in last place
[0:11:07] <%Solidnick18> darkling helps alot
[0:11:11] <Riottrio> To be honest, its a very common mistake to not utilise the darkling on a first playthrough
[0:11:12] <Junkles> one of my first games someone wanted to see the darkling strike animation and got countered. the winner got to steal the darkling weapon which is the strongest in the game
[0:11:13] <binkarus> Loser should be forced to sincerely acknowledge the validity of Pat's theories in a 500 word essay
[0:11:20] <Riottrio> so we're being a bit hard on reggie
[0:11:23] <glaciusinfinite> GET THE MURDEROUS INTENT REGGIE
[0:11:25] <jevichrono> he has a town or 2
[0:11:27] <+nintega010> Yea, but now you're. Really behind
[0:11:30] <kngmatthias> When does the Salt party start lmaoooo LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[0:11:37] <$legacy0117> Reggie needs to get high level gear before Minh's level reaches too far to take him out.
[0:11:38] <+Kduff89> we getting real?
[0:11:42] <+kekkerscrew> This early in the game, leveling the playing field is not really very important. Remember you only now just started leaving the first continent.
[0:12:00] <%andrei11dr> I think Woolie has the least towns actually
[0:12:06] <moonologist> Mix-up is still in play
[0:12:10] <@Solidus_113> we good
[0:12:11] <Junkles> @kekkerscrew this
[0:12:14] <jevichrono> Minh is Akuma, Reggie is Dan, Woolie is Ryu
[0:12:16] <sexdrugsvideogames> we're back!
[0:12:18] <Junkles> dokapon has so many swings
[0:12:20] <Riottrio> @kekkerscrew its early game, so losing everything to catch up is definitely worth it, because you ultimately are in a position where what you have is effectively worthless
[0:12:21] <%Solidnick18> just gotta take a little risk
[0:12:22] <yeetdabsenpai69> @andrei11dr he has more than 1
[0:12:24] <binkarus> Maybe it's just me, but no matter how deep in the lead I was, I would still vote for chaos everytime
[0:12:27] <%Livelinne> lomHonk lomHonk lomHonk
[0:12:28] <binkarus> Chaos > winning
[0:12:28] <%Solidnick18> all in good salt
[0:12:28] <$legacy0117> And taking away an opponent's equipments will slow them down too.
[0:12:30] <%andrei11dr> it's good now
[0:12:36] <glaciusinfinite> That's what darkling is supposed to do.
[0:12:42] <jevichrono> You're a thief. Steal the Mix up
[0:12:43] <%Livelinne> It’s crisp

[0:13:34] <Riottrio> Dankapon Minhdom
[0:13:41] <nathorz1> stonks
[0:13:51] <$legacy0117> Minh has the highest level equipment, may consider the mix up boys.
[0:13:56] <binkarus> Loser should wear 1/2 of the haircut of each of the other players.
[0:14:02] <RacistWakka> did they kill each other yet?
[0:14:04] <kngmatthias> Its a long road ahead LUL

[0:14:58] <sexdrugsvideogames> salt levels average
[0:15:01] <yeetdabsenpai69> weapons*
[0:15:02] <crimsonsaens> Trident is too expensive

[0:16:31] <Junkles> these towns are chump change tbh
[0:16:34] <%jiggy_snipe> only cuz you failed
[0:16:36] <+Amaideus> If he had kept going until he got it would it have equalized them?
[0:16:47] <+Amaideus> Seems like it was halfassing it that made it backfire
[0:16:53] <binkarus> The king hands out massive cities
[0:16:54] <%rubbishbinge> he woulda gotten 160k or so
[0:16:54] <sexdrugsvideogames> we'll never know
[0:16:55] <%neraren> Gotta risk it to get the biscuit

[0:18:10] <alephalpha> so how long till they back?
[0:18:26] <sexdrugsvideogames> its the reaper
[0:18:27] <$legacy0117> I bet Minh is going stay as a Thief through this whole thing, just because is a liar and thief.
[0:18:37] <kngmatthias> Woolz with the idoised salt
[0:18:38] <%jiggy_snipe> he switched to a warrior
[0:18:54] <%jiggy_snipe> but yes he is a liar and a thief
[0:18:56] <%bread_assassin> @legacy0117 But he's already a warrior.
[0:18:59] <$legacy0117> Ohhhh Ninja job...I see

[0:21:12] <Gramcracker55> Just strike it you'll be fine. Kappa

[0:22:24] <%neraren> Griiiind
[0:22:27] <%MaddyCaddy> Grind spot
[0:22:29] <yeetdabsenpai69> don't not worth it
[0:22:37] <binkarus> His parents made a mistake naming him Death Cloud. Should've gone for "hug cloud" so they could lull more players in
[0:22:39] <%neraren> You arent winning, you gotta risk it
[0:22:39] <RacistWakka> who's in the lead?
[0:22:51] <%GenesisKnight> Minh
[0:22:51] <sexdrugsvideogames> someone once said you gotta risk it to win...
[0:22:57] <nachohangovers> Don't bother with going into caves or dungeons unless prompted by the game. Or you want to got to the Casino Cave.
[0:22:57] <+Gespens> Minh by a mile
[0:22:57] <Riottrio> Minh, but they shouldn't pay too much attention this early on
[0:22:59] <djazo> use tje healing item
[0:23:03] <+gutlesscoward> minh has like triple the net worth of everyone else
[0:23:03] <crimsonsaens> You can get better equipment in the cave
[0:23:06] <%andrei11dr> It's good idea for Reggie though
[0:23:10] <flyingtentaclemonster> You heal over time though?
[0:23:25] <RacistWakka> oh boy I cant imagine the salt.
[0:23:48] <RurouniGeo> you didn't grind in the other cave woolie those enemies were trash
[0:23:48] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> You ground in a low lvl area though
[0:23:51] <%Th3SmartAlec> Weren't you chasing a rabbit and NOT grinding?
[0:23:54] <sexdrugsvideogames> Reggie, you got nothing to loose tho
[0:24:00] <crimsonsaens> You need to grind to beat the town monsters though
[0:24:00] <TheArrow_> you know what gives xp? murder
[0:24:02] <binkarus> Yeah you gotta grind in a high lvl area
[0:24:04] <RurouniGeo> you grind in the cave in chapter 1 not chapter 3 like you were doing holy crap man
[0:24:04] <Riottrio> its funny, because if reggie became darkling and hoarded his points, all of Minh's monetary lead could be gone
[0:24:06] <yeetdabsenpai69> won't work
[0:24:10] <NeroInfinite> OOOF
[0:24:10] <@Solidus_113> LUL

[0:24:24] <+kekkerscrew> OH MY
[0:24:24] <Riottrio> well, Minh got rid of the bug
[0:24:26] <+Amaideus> Literally no one should be believe that
[0:24:28] <casualcthulhu11> that actually helped tho
[0:24:29] <Riottrio> Minh is not a liar
[0:24:29] <+Amaideus> That was so blatant
[0:24:30] <+b_aleph> salt rises
[0:24:30] <crimsonsaens> Now the Bug will disappear because he has no items
[0:24:34] <TwinBat> TELLING LIES

[0:24:37] <%RioGascar> BIG LIES
[0:24:37] <Rayduoz> LUL
[0:24:40] <binkarus> Minh got some kind of mouth curse. The words he says are 100% wrong
[0:24:41] <%Livelinne> Wooow woolieMIRIN
[0:24:43] <%bread_assassin> Mihn tried.
[0:24:43] <RacistWakka> oh man. someone spoil me if Reggie was a good Darkling?
[0:24:45] <Riottrio> Minh told the truth, but is still a thief
[0:24:45] <sexdrugsvideogames> big monstar
[0:24:45] <Rayduoz> Yes sbo him more
[0:24:46] <%jiggy_snipe> Reggie prolonged the bug by buying items and stuff lol
[0:24:47] <%Solidnick18> oh nooo
[0:24:49] <JetpackMcQuack> What is happening to Mihn
[0:24:50] <+kekkerscrew> Wandering treasure hawk
[0:24:50] <+Amaideus> SEE
[0:24:54] <+Amaideus> LISTEN TO THAT
[0:24:55] <binkarus> It's not like Pat's affliction, it's some kind of dyslexia of the mouth
[0:24:56] <flyingtentaclemonster> BS Minh
[0:24:57] <%NWannabe> No he doesn't. Reggie has a contractual obligation to not start smoke. He dont want no trouble

[0:25:19] <+Amaideus> That buffed up STR, jesus
[0:25:20] <NeroInfinite> Did it take the bug?
[0:25:23] <Idon__> MINH huge
[0:25:24] <crimsonsaens> It had to be one of the unique items, like the magazine
[0:25:25] <Riottrio> Minh the hero
[0:25:26] <+FaderPotater> Dokapon unlocked Minh's true potential
[0:25:30] <sexdrugsvideogames> THANK YOU MINH
[0:25:30] <%GenesisKnight> ROB HIM REGGIE
[0:25:36] <+Amaideus> This is gaslighting, right
[0:25:36] <RacistWakka> Minh is the master Whittaker.
[0:25:40] <flyingtentaclemonster> BULLSHIT
[0:25:41] <Zayasu> LUL
[0:25:43] <sexdrugsvideogames> Minh the exterminator
[0:25:43] <RacistWakka> shit talker
[0:25:44] <Riottrio> Minh is such a jedi
[0:25:46] <%RioGascar> walter “minh” white: everything i do, I DO FOR MY FAMILY
[0:25:48] <JetpackMcQuack> gameattackWut
[0:25:49] <Tooniearcade> evo19Laugh
[0:25:56] <crimsonsaens> This isn't gaslighting, this is Minh being an ass
[0:26:00] <NeroInfinite> LOL
[0:26:00] <LeafarOznolam> it's a gnome
[0:26:02] <%NWannabe> Mad but never mad at the cause for it

[0:26:16] <sexdrugsvideogames> cool
[0:26:16] <TheArrow_> GAMBLING WOO
[0:26:21] <+Amaideus> So if it increases by 200%
[0:26:21] <Riottrio> bitch as gnome clocks you one, then gets on his knees and BEGS
[0:26:22] <kingkeldeo31> these low magic stats are gonna be the death of them
[0:26:24] <+Amaideus> That's triple right?
[0:26:30] <jevichrono> The saltening begins
[0:26:32] <yeetdabsenpai69> attack inh
[0:26:32] <%neraren> Lava caveeee
[0:26:33] <TheArrow_> can't get lucky if you don't roll the dice
[0:26:33] <+Amaideus> Because +50% is half added
[0:26:35] <yeetdabsenpai69> minh*
[0:26:36] <Goat_Baka> 200% is double
[0:26:39] <+Gespens> a 200% increase is triple value, yes @Amaideus
[0:26:41] <+dollarstored> is roadblock rock kin to aesop rock
[0:26:42] <$legacy0117> So as far as I can tell, Reggie is still a newbie Ike, Woolie is Captain Falcon serving community service, and Minh has become a Korrin, if I can measure Speed and power stats correctly.

[0:26:47] <%jiggy_snipe> @kingkeldeo31 i think they half realize it lol

[0:32:58] <yeetdabsenpai69> equipment
[0:33:00] <RurouniGeo> Minh's level 6 town taken away hurts him way more than taking his weapon but that's a 1/12 chance so taking the weapon is the most stable choice
[0:33:08] <royb2> if you take his weapon and keep stomping him you'll get more wins
[0:33:09] <reonome> TAKE HIS CASH
[0:33:09] <moonologist> he wont have the money tho
[0:33:18] <sexdrugsvideogames> cash
[0:33:22] <crimsonsaens> Trident is better
[0:33:23] <Riottrio> @paladinstarbuster I'd go for them over town, but Town wouldn't be a bad choice, especially if Reggie is never going Darkling
[0:33:28] <alephalpha> taking weapons means he's easier to kill
[0:33:30] <+Amaideus> Taking his weapon will just force him to go buy a new one
[0:33:32] <+gutlesscoward> T O W N

[0:33:46] <+Amaideus> And Woolie's not gonna keep hunting him down to beat him into the ground
[0:33:47] <Junkles> have to collect taxes from towns

[0:33:51] <$legacy0117> I would break his trident, since he'll have to scramble to get a new one.
[0:33:51] <RurouniGeo> taking weapon is the stable choice taking town is a gamble
[0:33:52] <+Pookiedaexzile> Take a TOWN
[0:33:56] <sexdrugsvideogames> give him bad advice, reggie
[0:33:57] <%MaddyCaddy> Cut his source of income, like that makes the most sense
[0:33:58] <%Solidnick18> i would say the gloves
[0:33:58] <Idon__> Woolie, just take what you like this is too much thinking
[0:33:58] <patrickIy> Take the Trident
[0:33:58] <+paladinstarbuster> take them gloves
[0:34:02] <+b_aleph> gloves
[0:34:02] <Riottrio> You can take trident, then throw it away
[0:34:02] <crimsonsaens> I'd take a town

[0:35:25] <Riottrio> @Goat_Baka I skipped ahead in the manga, but I'm totally going back afterwards. having face-cam is so worth it
[0:35:29] <%MaddyCaddy> That seemed like a dumb move
[0:35:36] <binkarus> That was a fine move
[0:35:37] <yeetdabsenpai69> trident is warrtir based!
[0:35:43] <crimsonsaens> Cleric is not wrrior based
[0:35:44] <+Amaideus> The gloves was definitely the right choice
[0:35:44] <gunsrlove> Furious Vengeance ruined by overthinking

[0:35:52] <%jiggy_snipe> damage not attack so it won't show
[0:35:56] <+Amaideus> Hard to get back, nerfs him "permanently", buffs yourself
[0:35:57] <%andrei11dr> Minh is like a couple of spaces away from buying a new weapon
[0:35:58] <JetpackMcQuack> 3 Kreygasm
[0:36:03] <RurouniGeo> @MaddyCaddy tossing the weapon is a hurt to the player 100%. taking a level 6 town hurts more but that is random
[0:36:04] <LeafarOznolam> woolieOMG PJSalt
[0:36:08] <Riottrio> Trident still isn't a terrible choice. it could take Minh many MANY turns to land on the weapon shop
[0:36:08] <royb2> now attack him again
[0:36:09] <+Pookiedaexzile> Woolie thinks he's a strategist
[0:36:18] <binkarus> @WoolieVersus There's this concept in chess called "tempo" which is similar to initiative. By taking his trident, he has to waste time getting another weapon, which means you've gained tempo.
[0:36:18] <+gutlesscoward> oh wow

[0:45:04] <blink289> embrace the darkness
[0:45:08] <JetpackMcQuack> Winner
[0:45:10] <NeroInfinite> It just blocks movement
[0:45:13] <+Amaideus> It drops a block you can't walk onto/past
[0:45:13] <Goat_Baka> History does favor the brave too, but mostly the bold
[0:45:14] <Riottrio> @binkarus spawns a big rock that blocks a space. Super niche in terms of use
[0:45:15] <%MaddyCaddy> Camp Minh's spawn
[0:45:20] <DaBigVitus> @Riottrio oh wow, then I'm out. don't want to spoil myself. enjoy, all!
[0:45:21] <+Amaideus> There's no way
[0:45:21] <nachohangovers> lol power poke
[0:45:22] <crimsonsaens> If only there was a magician
[0:45:22] <sexdrugsvideogames> oh, thats no problem for you, woolie
[0:45:28] <%neraren> Just 135 attack
[0:45:29] <NeroInfinite> 135 AT

[0:45:30] <binkarus> @Riottrio grazzi
[0:45:30] <alephalpha> why haven't they bought defensive magic actually?
[0:45:31] <RacistWakka> go for it! bruh
[0:45:34] <yeetdabsenpai69> @binkarus can' pass it on the board
[0:45:35] <%RioGascar> Drop a block in minhs path
[0:45:38] <sexdrugsvideogames> take the lead
[0:45:38] <aeonicvector> Yo just got back, nice to see yoru in MURICA now
[0:45:40] <flyingtentaclemonster> 2 in a row?
[0:45:40] <+Amaideus> And takes more than 2 hits to kill unless you strike
[0:45:43] <+agumon9000> They underestimate how fucking busted magic is late game
[0:45:44] <Drunkengen> Magic his ass
[0:45:45] <binkarus> Maybe if he actually uses a buff before going into the fight he could take him
[0:45:46] <monster343> 6 sp tho
[0:45:49] <%Jetzord> lock Woolie into the town
[0:45:49] <binkarus> Use charge then fight
[0:45:51] <Riottrio> @alephalpha They don't know how helpful it would be I guess

[0:46:40] <%andrei11dr> STRIKE
[0:46:40] <+Amaideus> It has to be 2 strikes to kill before it kills you

[0:48:21] <Riottrio> @aeonicvector not in this game. Defense only protects 1.4hp per point, so 10HP is way more powerful, and let your defense rise naturally from shiels

[0:49:34] <Riottrio> we can only hope
[0:49:36] <%neraren> Use your elixir next turn
[0:49:39] <RurouniGeo> even with strike his weapon isn't good enough to kill in one
[0:49:40] <alephalpha> @SirGO0SE cancle your backdash into a yrc backdash
[0:49:42] <Goat_Baka> Reggie sensed bitch in his own heart
[0:49:42] <NeroInfinite> 2 spinner isn't so bad
[0:49:43] <%RioGascar> Attack him, no balls
[0:49:54] <krymzen5> don't make eye contact LUL
[0:49:57] <binkarus> Time for woolie to take it
[0:50:02] <+kekkerscrew> Yeah Keep Walkin
[0:50:03] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> Imagine not playing FF7 right now
[0:50:11] <binkarus> 1hitko
[0:50:14] <sexdrugsvideogames> is this the comeback?
[0:50:16] <yeetdabsenpai69> reggie PLEASE level or go darkling so you CAN leel?
[0:50:18] <%RioGascar> Imagine not playing DOKAPON RIGHT NOW
[0:50:19] <aeonicvector> @Riottrio correct, but maximum hp dosent take any natrual buffs, whereas defense, while only 1.4 per, can benefit from effects to increase it such as consumables, and arent ignored by later game options save those that utterly ignore (such as Powerpoke)
[0:50:30] <+agumon9000> You had the crystal!
[0:50:31] <flyingtentaclemonster> Yo Woolie's so stronk now!
[0:50:37] <Riottrio> @LegendaryDorkKnight I got the game really early. i'm still not done, but I will delay beating it for dokapon content
[0:50:37] <binkarus> @agumon9000 lol
[0:50:39] <Xeno351> Imagine not knowing what nomura is doing to FF7

[0:50:51] <kngmatthias> BibleThump BibleThump
[0:50:52] <aeonicvector> ergo, if your focused on regen, you pour into defense early, then pump that hp naturally since your in the cleric line
[0:50:54] <%Dash_rendar89> go to town area
[0:51:03] <kingkeldeo31> just land on the blank space
[0:51:03] <%Dash_rendar89> three up for grabs

[0:52:35] <+agumon9000> ??????
[0:52:40] <royb2> I sense bitch
[0:52:41] <Riottrio> @aeonicvector While i agree about the buffs making defense more useable in certain situations, Powerpoke is just as unaffected by defense as HP. And if you have more HP, you'll still have more HP left after being hit by moves like power poke.
[0:52:43] <Klefth> What a bitch
[0:52:45] <$legacy0117> Get outta here Dark Magician.

[1:31:30] <Goat_Baka> Maximum Coward
[1:31:31] <flyingtentaclemonster> THIS MOFO
[1:31:33] <moonologist> cave time
[1:31:34] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:31:34] <$legacy0117> You guys will need to split that Bloodpool gamble pot if things don't work out. Even if Minh is totally disappeared.
[1:31:34] <%neraren> Party cave!
[1:31:36] <+agumon9000> WOOLIE WASN'T PAYING ATTENTION
[1:31:37] <htimssamoht> No, go for the objective
[1:31:38] <Idon__> MAXIMUM COWARDICE
[1:31:38] <SethKyu> Escape only works on his turn, tho
[1:31:39] <NeroInfinite> you need that temple Reggie
[1:31:41] <reonome> party cave LUL
[1:31:42] <NickHatesSnow> party cave
[1:31:43] <crimsonsaens> Can't he give up against Woolie too, for perfect defense?
[1:31:44] <htimssamoht> 5 Money tricksters, Reggie!
[1:31:45] <elrey745> !uptime
[1:31:46] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 1 hour and 31 minutes
[1:31:46] <Riottrio> while this bounty hunt goes om, he can catch up
[1:31:47] <%ekodrop> seriously reggie...
[1:31:48] <RurouniGeo> this is why Reggie is in last place lol
[1:31:59] <glaciusinfinite> Take this time to catch up Reggie
[1:32:08] <Riottrio> or turn darling and drag them down to his level
[1:32:09] <kingkeldeo31> It's now or never
[1:32:11] <%andrei11dr> I don't think any of you are heroes
[1:32:13] <%GeneralSCPatton> Heroes tactically advance in the opposite direction of danger
[1:32:13] <$SilverRoddo> Heroes set up to backdown
[1:32:13] <%jiggy_snipe> I guess if Reggie clears towns while these two are screwing around
[1:32:15] <+pectusumbra> If reggie just uses magic on monsters to even the odds he can start getting a nice town lead
[1:32:17] <%neraren> Go big Woolz
[1:32:18] <%GenesisKnight> SPINNER
[1:32:20] <Xeno351> reggie is in last place almost solely on his decision to be fair
[1:32:22] <TigerClaws12> YO LUL
[1:32:23] <Idon__> Both these guys are on wild goose chases, time to catch up Reggie
[1:32:26] <htimssamoht> 5 Money Tricksters to the king and you get a free castles

[1:34:16] <yeildingthought> LUL
[1:34:17] <+Amaideus> That's right
[1:34:19] <+pectusumbra> You have to click on woolie first minh
[1:34:20] <%jiggy_snipe> this is the best content right here
[1:34:20] <Riottrio> ong Minh big brain plays
[1:34:25] <htimssamoht> Can't move yourself!
[1:34:25] <@Solidus_113> Minh that's not for you
[1:34:26] <TigerClaws12> BIG BRAIN?
[1:34:27] <Xeno351> you have to select woolie first
[1:34:29] <+agumon9000> You have to select the target
[1:34:30] <reonome> pick the player first minh
[1:34:31] <Gramcracker55> You select the target first
[1:34:37] <therealtacopancakes> skyBruh
[1:34:39] <binkarus> oof
[1:34:40] <yeetdabsenpai69> he didn't select woolie
[1:34:41] <Riottrio> no use it properly Minh
[1:34:41] <%neraren> Pick the square first
[1:34:41] <NeroInfinite> He has to select someone first
[1:34:47] <$SilverRoddo> Heel move, Minh puts all the heat on himself.
[1:34:48] <+Amaideus> That's unintuitive
[1:34:52] <binkarus> Thinking is a crime here
[1:34:52] <+A0N33> If Reggie were in here this would have been the biggest brain plays LUL
[1:34:54] <%GeneralSCPatton> yeah, this is smol brain time
[1:34:57] <Riottrio> wow Minh just failed his big clever tactic
[1:35:04] <TheArrow_> dangerously close to doing something cool
[1:35:06] <+agumon9000> Mihn didn't even try
[1:35:08] <Riottrio> big brain moment to small brain play
[1:35:10] <glaciusinfinite> Select a person brainius
[1:35:11] <%rubbishbinge> on the green tho
[1:35:13] <+Amaideus> I know why he didn't do it
[1:35:14] <%jiggy_snipe> check it
[1:35:15] <%andrei11dr> @woolieversus You need to select the target first
[1:35:15] <+dollarstored> if reggie went into the cave
[1:35:19] <Ralfclogs> Rip Mihn
[1:35:20] <+dollarstored> it woulda been perfect
[1:35:21] <+Amaideus> He tried to move himself the first time
[1:35:22] <NeroInfinite> YOU're VERY good
[1:35:22] <%xeromage> When your enemy advances, you withdraw. Minh knows the Art of War
[1:35:23] <+Grayhammatter> you're good
[1:35:24] <binkarus> You can't expect a mouse to solve a maze built for a human
[1:35:24] <TigerClaws12> you're fine
[1:35:24] <htimssamoht> Reggie, anybody can get towns, but THIS IS YOUR ONLY CHANCE TO GET THIS CASTLE
[1:35:25] <+Amaideus> But it doesn't let you do that
[1:35:25] <+agumon9000> He didn't even try
[1:35:26] <+Eternalyoshi> you got this
[1:35:27] <%jiggy_snipe> he debuffed?
[1:35:28] <$legacy0117> No he is trying to reposition, yeah.
[1:35:28] <moonologist> ezpz reg
[1:35:29] <sexdrugsvideogames> good thinking minh!
[1:35:31] <+Amaideus> Then he tried to pick the space first
[1:35:32] <htimssamoht> Go get that town!
[1:35:34] <+Amaideus> But it didn't let him
[1:35:35] <+Grayhammatter> you got this reggie
[1:35:40] <Riottrio> yeah, you can't Psycho kinesis yourself

[2:08:59] <viewtifulr> reggie is the true hero for going towards the objective

[2:09:06] <htimssamoht> No
[2:09:11] <nothuzad> minh shutting it down hard :D
[2:09:18] <RurouniGeo> yes the caves are good don't be afraid of them
[2:09:19] <htimssamoht> You had tricksters in Asianna, the first continent.
[2:09:19] <zenith0111> You're better off playing it like a board game and just commit to a direction rather than just walk back and forth like you guys have been doing.
[2:09:20] <+Grayhammatter> fair
[2:09:21] <Riottrio> Reggie's best bet would be to stay in that loop
[2:09:27] <Idon__> Minh is untouchable
[2:09:31] <Riottrio> that way he can roll two numbers and land on the shop rather than 1
[2:09:32] <zenith0111> Wasted so many turns doing that.
[2:09:35] <crimsonsaens> You cannot buy Tricksters except at that store
[2:09:39] <%GenesisKnight> You need AoE's to hurt Minh
[2:09:43] <sexdrugsvideogames> go to the cave

[2:10:14] <djazo> see the diamond you have
[2:10:18] <+b_aleph> 5 crystal from the store lets you fight minh
[2:10:19] <djazo> sell

[2:17:19] <$legacy0117> Woolie chose escape for some reason over Heal, when he clearly has high HP.
[2:17:37] <%Solidnick18> YO
[2:17:54] <yeetdabsenpai69> @legacy0117 heal cn't save you from two hitters
[2:18:04] <yeetdabsenpai69> escape can save you from 1 hitters
[2:18:04] <$legacy0117> True this.
[2:18:05] <alephalpha> if you can tak 2 hits and survive heal is lkinda great

[2:19:09] <%jiggy_snipe> Minh's not dodging
[2:19:11] <zenith0111> Healing everytime is super strong escape is only if you're losing. Which is a scenario you can usually avoid. So escape is kinda redundant
[2:19:13] <+nintega010> Isn't black mail death
[2:19:14] <DerpioParty> Oof, that lack of defense
[2:19:19] <%Livelinne> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp

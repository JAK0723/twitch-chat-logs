[0:51:49] <TuxedoNash> Tallgeese 2 has the best victory pose
[0:51:51] <Dapper_Cactuar> Tallgeese 3 is one lower
[0:51:52] <Spirit_NB> The III is just below

[0:52:33] <ShinobiPhoenix> I love Tallgeese III, it's Tallgeese with Epyon

[0:52:35] <khetrak> fucking gundam what
[0:52:36] <%Solidnick18> death scythe Kreygasm
[0:52:39] <Bustahhwulf> woolie isnt looking at melee suits

[0:52:43] <Belutima> I kinda want Reggie to do a , RATE the MobileSuit, doodStare since he barely knows anything about Gundam
[0:52:49] <UltimateAzure> Fighting also gives the most Boost Refill, regardless of suit
[0:52:50] <GeneralHysterics> a lot kids die in IBO, woolie should love that show
[0:52:50] <RyuuAoi> @khetrak WE IN THERE. DEEP

[0:52:57] <black_pariah> pick space guts
[0:52:59] <%Eaglestrike117> @WoolieVersus If you want a good F suit, go with Red frame astray, Blue Destiny or BAEL
[0:53:00] <%ChoculaUltra> oooh Reggie doing a Rate-The-Suit would be hilarious.
[0:53:07] <GeneralHysterics> like, A LOT of child soldiers get got

[0:53:28] <+TheKeyLimit> X1 Full Cloth is OURGUY
[0:53:29] <+XxBTExX> @RyTYoung you can stick to the basics though and stick to one of the universes no need to go all in. Maybe watch Origins

[0:53:30] <+xeros720> loved using crossbone
[0:53:39] <khetrak> crossbone FC best gundam

[0:57:03] <+TheKeyLimit> Who needs guns when you have a sword directly connected to your Gundam's generator
[0:57:06] <alephalpha> Epyon is a bit hard to udnerstand the basics with
[0:57:06] <+xGreenflame> Shooting Epyon is disrespectful
[0:57:07] <%Theycallmenerf> Good taste Reggie
[0:57:13] <Bustahhwulf> wing homie all my homies love wing
[0:57:15] <+LokimenD> marida ):
[0:57:17] <TuxedoNash> @Dova573 Real soundtrack would get them copyright struck like crazy
[0:57:36] <+xeros720> the sandrock is cool, heat blades are rad!
[0:57:39] <+XxBTExX> Wing is probably one of the worst gundam series
[0:57:39] <neozz13> @ChoculaUltra undefeated of the teeth
[0:57:44] <ShinobiPhoenix> what are you talking about, Quarte is the story...
[0:57:47] <FreedomARX7> Sandrock is tanky boi
[0:57:48] <+xeros720> quatre is kind of y'know though
[0:57:50] <%Jrockoni> yo this song slaps
[0:57:51] <%ChoculaUltra> LUL
[0:57:59] <Lichzim> I literally just realized that Kamen Rider Skull was in the banner down there
[0:58:01] <+TheKeyLimit> Wing is okay but it isnt the worst at all
[0:58:03] <%Solidnick18> ON
[0:58:08] <KnivesEve> which is worse: Wing or Destiny
[0:58:09] <cheesedburgers> FUCK wufei all my homies hate wufei
[0:58:12] <%SilverRoddo> woolieOMG no shipping Quattro
[0:58:13] <neozz13> Wing is in no way the worst when 00, Seed and IBO exist
[0:58:13] <zashzila> Who's being epyon?
[0:58:14] <FreedomARX7> Gundam fight ready?
[0:58:16] <Lichzim> surprised to see him in there....perhaps Super Climax Heroes will come soon
[0:58:17] <ShinobiPhoenix> Destiny
[0:58:21] <FreedomARX7> GO!
[0:58:21] <zashzila> ABABABABABABABABAB as epyon.
[0:58:26] <+JDebss> man that's an ugly mech
[0:58:26] <RyuuAoi> Reggie FUKT
[0:58:36] <Jashter18> Gundam Fight All Set
[0:58:54] <biomegabear> gatcha force vibes in gameplay
[0:58:55] <Bustahhwulf> reggie doesnt get his ammo count lol
[0:59:09] <zashzila> As epyon just mash melee and primary reg.
[0:59:11] <+FreyRune> my biggest advice to this game, never stand still. always keep moving
[0:59:11] <+Tacotouchdown> Quattro is g g g ggay???
[0:59:12] <+KillMeImHere> it's melee only
[0:59:15] <alephalpha> reggie doens't have ammo
[0:59:16] <RyuuAoi> ! REGGIE SALT !
[0:59:19] <+xGreenflame> Epyon doesn't have an ammo count it's all sword
[0:59:33] <+XxBTExX> Epyon is such a terrible suit
[0:59:40] <dmstiles> Ok, I've been on the fence about watching turnA. Is it really good(Mostly a UC guy)?
[0:59:46] <zashzila> Epyon slaps so hard.
[0:59:48] <+Tacotouchdown> epyon is a bad beginning suit
[0:59:50] <lem______> shoulda made it "training mode"
[0:59:53] <%RyTYoung> PogChamp
[0:59:54] <%HeroVersusOfficial> HeroVersusOfficial subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! Yooooo Hero with the half? What's good, friends. Sorry I haven't had many updates lately, but we're working on some VERY special things that I hope will be worth the wait. Release is around the corner, so we hope you'll continue to be patient with us.
[0:59:54] <Dante_Namikaze1> @xxbtexx its great
[0:59:57] <zashzila> Yan do like 350 damage easy.
[1:00:07] <+atin2000> "epyon is bad" says people that havent played the game
[1:00:10] <cheesedburgers> This song fucks
[1:00:10] <Gelphaze> man how cool would it be if the devil Gundam was on here.
[1:00:10] <neozz13> @dmstiles Turn A is UC so how would you not watch it
[1:00:10] <RyuuAoi> REKT
[1:00:12] <zashzila> Make him do the baby epyon combo!!!!
[1:00:18] <+xeros720> combos in this game are weird to start with and epyron is weirder? that's rough
[1:00:22] <Belutima> @dmstiles yeah its fucking good, one of Tominos best, pacing is different tho. so dont pussy out
[1:00:24] <+SwitcheroOP> Is this game on PC yet D:
[1:00:25] <zashzila> Just mash square and triangle!!!
[1:00:27] <zashzila> aaaaaaaaaaaa
[1:00:29] <Lieutori> Epyon, aka spin to win melee
[1:00:31] <%Axle13j> melee melee, step, melee melee, step etc for Epyon
[1:00:32] <+Tacotouchdown> @atin2000 ikr
[1:00:34] <SpaceGuntank> you have to imput a direction to swing again, alternatively you can MASH triangle and square to combo
[1:00:35] <GeneralHysterics> wait, turn A is UC? I thought it was it's own AU
[1:00:36] <Blank9> the epyon 2 frame animation combo loop
[1:00:39] <neozz13> Turn A is best series no cap
[1:00:46] <Dante_Namikaze1> so who's teaching them how to play?
[1:00:46] <+TheKeyLimit> Turn A is ALL The timelines @GeneralHysterics
[1:00:46] <zashzila> Its not optimal but its the easy combo for beginingers.
[1:00:59] <biomegabear> someone repping turn a? nice
[1:01:00] <DedlokPM> @GeneralHysterics it is indeed its own AU
[1:01:04] <KnivesEve> isnt turn A take place at the end of the UC timeline?
[1:01:04] <GeneralHysterics> I don't know what that means, lol
[1:01:07] <+Tacotouchdown> Turn A is Gundam trying to be Ghible studios
[1:01:07] <cheesedburgers> Turn A is just breath of the wild
[1:01:12] <Rhinoprotoss> Why is so much screen space wasted on the black bars
[1:01:15] <Jashter18> @generalhysterics. Turn is weird and technically canon to everything or something
[1:01:22] <+xeros720> framerate i imagine
[1:01:23] <neozz13> @GeneralHysterics Turn A is not au
[1:01:28] <Dante_Namikaze1> @kniveseve turn A is at the end of every timeline
[1:01:31] <+TheMismatcher> Yooo
[1:01:31] <+xeros720> it runs pretty great for a split screen
[1:01:34] <+TheKeyLimit> pretty much that
[1:01:34] <dmstiles> Hmm ok. I'll put it on the list! Right after galactic heroes :D
[1:01:41] <+TheKeyLimit> It is basically what if all the timelines converged into one
[1:01:49] <DedlokPM> @GeneralHysterics It takes place in "Correct Century" so it is AU
[1:02:00] <+Tacotouchdown> Hidden combos
[1:02:03] <zashzila> I need to see reggie do the top combo.
[1:02:09] <%SilverRoddo> Real talk: Musha Gundam would destroy all.
[1:02:13] <andre11dr> Iea ,The FA Gundam has multiple combos that just aren't listed
[1:02:14] <$g0g3t4> did they say what the plan is for ROTD coming later? fightcade?
[1:02:17] <zashzila> L2 makes epyon go super mode!
[1:02:22] <+Tacotouchdown> @dedlokpm so is G reco but its the same universe
[1:02:25] <Dante_Namikaze1> why is there a SNES sounding version of Stardust Memory's second op?
[1:02:25] <%Axle13j> I would LOVE Musha in this
[1:02:27] <neozz13> @GeneralHysterics it literally takes all the history from UC the g reco continues it, which is UC centric
[1:02:36] <neozz13> Every Tomino series is UC
[1:02:51] <Belutima> @dmstiles Logh, Nice
[1:02:52] <neozz13> @Tacotouchdown exactly
[1:02:56] <UltimateAzure> @Dante_Namikaze1 Woolie Playlist, since they don't wanna risk copyright with in-game OPs & etc
[1:02:56] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:02:58] <+TheKeyLimit> No way G reco is UC
[1:03:06] <+TheKeyLimit> ..Is it?
[1:03:09] <FreedomARX7> it is
[1:03:10] <zer0enixx> Kinda
[1:03:10] <andre11dr> Cross Bone is UC right?
[1:03:12] <+TheMismatcher> G reco is super future UC
[1:03:15] <+TheMismatcher> Like 100 years later
[1:03:15] <neozz13> @TheKeyLimit watch the show
[1:03:15] <Dante_Namikaze1> @thekeylimit sotra
[1:03:16] <FennecZephyr> Greco has a Zaku in it
[1:03:23] <FennecZephyr> It's UC
[1:03:23] <UltimateAzure> @andre11dr Yes, it follows up after F91
[1:03:23] <+TheMismatcher> 1000 years *
[1:03:27] <+TheKeyLimit> Im so hesitant i've heard a lot about G reco
[1:03:35] <+TheKeyLimit> Any im still in the middle of Turn A
[1:03:36] <%Reverend_Roscoe> technically it's ALL UC
[1:03:38] <zer0enixx> So far in the future, that it might as well not matter
[1:03:38] <FennecZephyr> It's not great
[1:03:50] <KeroKamina> STAND UP TO THE VICTORY
[1:03:52] <lem______> differs from suit to suit
[1:03:54] <andre11dr> Oh ,iea F91 is UC ,i forgot
[1:04:01] <+Tacotouchdown> g-reco put me to ResidentSleeper
[1:04:04] <+TheKeyLimit> F91 is UC, As is crossbone
[1:04:07] <+Doc1790> Link the guide in that chat
[1:04:07] <SoromopsEX> Does that guy have Vegeta´s Voice lol
[1:04:09] <+TheKeyLimit> But like pretty far into the future
[1:04:13] <andre11dr> It's been a long time since I've seen some of these
[1:04:13] <neozz13> G reco is 200 years after Turn A, that is literally said by tomino himself
[1:04:14] <cheesedburgers> STAND UP TO THE VIC-TO-RY
[1:04:14] <foiledyetagain> normal walking isn't used at all, people only boost dash and hop
[1:04:24] <FreedomARX7> Thats DIOs voice actor
[1:04:26] <dmstiles> I tried G reco, but stopped early on. It was....weird
[1:04:35] <%Reverend_Roscoe> f91 IS LIKE 80 YRS AFTER 0079
[1:04:36] <+Tacotouchdown> G-Savior is a furtherst in the UC timeline
[1:04:46] <%Axle13j> You can set room cost to infinite for the sake of labbing
[1:04:47] <spirittiart> speaking of voice actors. 2009 my friends saw Tōru Furuya in sauna. so jealous.
[1:04:56] <+TheKeyLimit> Takehito Voices a character in Turn A
[1:04:56] <SoromopsEX> Damn I thought Dio´s VA only did Smooth Voices
[1:05:01] <GeltonZ> YAY! V Gundam was my first Gundam...because someone sold us raw tapes of Japanese television and I had NO CLUE what was going on but STAND UP TO THE VICTORY!!!
[1:05:13] <@akuda_bar> @spirittiart would you be more or less jealous if they had met him somewhere that wasnt a sauna
[1:05:17] <dmstiles> Oh gods gsaviour. Whyyyyy?
[1:05:19] <andre11dr> @spirittiart That's the Char guy right?
[1:05:19] <FreedomARX7> Hes three different characters in gundam lol
[1:05:28] <+TheKeyLimit> Toru and Ikeda are so recognizable it's amazing
[1:05:35] <cheesedburgers> Victory Gundam rules
[1:05:47] <HelluvaNohbody> YO EZ8
[1:05:51] <neozz13> Victory is one of my favourites
[1:05:54] <SpaceGuntank> you can easly get OHKOd at overcost, it sucks.
[1:06:00] <zashzila> Do the top combo with epyon!!!!
[1:06:04] <+Tacotouchdown> victory Dark AF but its good
[1:06:09] <Blank9> 2000 costs are almost all my favorites
[1:06:18] <+Tacotouchdown> F91 got turned into crossbone
[1:06:30] <+TheKeyLimit> F91 was the lead into Crossbone
[1:06:39] <andre11dr> Representing the ground jobers i see
[1:06:52] <+RenoDeGeneric> Like Master Gundam?
[1:06:57] <zer0enixx> If the epyon looks like its having a seziure mid combo; then its doing it right
[1:06:57] <+SilverFoxxx> this game is sick
[1:07:06] <+Tacotouchdown> but f91 was gonna be a series that got turned into just a movie then salvaged into Crossbone
[1:07:26] <+TheKeyLimit> Yeah im so mad they turned f91 into a movie only
[1:07:28] <Bustahhwulf> bdc bazooka is good
[1:07:30] <andre11dr> Cross Bone is hard seque to F91
[1:07:31] <cheesedburgers> No offense but This Is Only The Beginning
[1:07:33] <HelluvaNohbody> Tear your arm off and hit him with it
[1:07:35] <+TheKeyLimit> It had so much potential
[1:07:35] <+RealPT1> some suits have shields that will block if they face shoots
[1:08:02] <foiledyetagain> you should probably teach them about boost hops, dashes and fuwasteps before suit specifics
[1:08:12] <+TheKeyLimit> fuwastep oh my god thats adorable
[1:08:14] <+Tacotouchdown> F90 is getting a lot of Model kit love by bandai lately tho
[1:08:16] <SoromopsEX> Dude I wanna get into Gundam but dunno where to even start lol
[1:08:17] <andre11dr> Im going to have a really bad time trying to remember everyone's names LUL
[1:08:28] <+TheKeyLimit> 0079 is always a good start @SoromopsEX
[1:08:30] <neozz13> @SoromopsEX the first one
[1:08:30] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @SoromopsEX 0079
[1:08:31] <Flamethrowerman09> I've heard that F91 is pretty bad
[1:08:40] <Flamethrowerman09> I'm starting with Turn-A
[1:08:42] <SpaceGuntank> nearly every suit has a dediated assist button
[1:08:43] <+Tacotouchdown> f91 is a rushed movie
[1:08:44] <+RealPT1> build fighters is low stakes and good fun
[1:08:44] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @Flamethrowerman09 you heard wrong
[1:08:52] <cheesedburgers> Gundam 1979 is still good and people should watch it
[1:08:52] <+Vigonept> for some reason i though this was gbo2
[1:08:53] <Bustahhwulf> lol they arent listening
[1:08:57] <GeneralHysterics> ooh he burstin
[1:08:58] <neozz13> F91 is great
[1:09:04] <zer0enixx> Definitely start with 79 and follow uc by order of release
[1:09:11] <Belutima> @Tacotouchdown F90 is getting allot of attention because of the UC NEXT 0100 project, where they will cover the timeline from Unicorn till 0120 UC timeline, which leads into F91
[1:09:14] <townzzzzz> yo the team
[1:09:27] <+RealPT1> has jokes that might hit harder if you have knowledge of Gundam in general
[1:09:29] <SoromopsEX> Okay imma start with 0079 then! Ty!!
[1:09:31] <+atin2000> so, the issue here is that epyon is kinda hard, and ez8 isnt
[1:09:32] <CrookedNoseArts> Silent voice
[1:09:33] <storytayl0r> Please God let someone take someone from G Gundam
[1:09:42] <zer0enixx> Ty?
[1:09:48] <dmstiles> Build fighters is the guiltiest of guilty pleasures
[1:09:49] <%Axle13j> Neutral in this is jump and shoot
[1:09:53] <Blank9> anime ja nai
[1:09:56] <townzzzzz> fry da sky
[1:09:57] <cheesedburgers> Judau Ashta hero of space
[1:09:57] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1303234770881699840?s=19
[1:09:58] <foiledyetagain> there's also charge moves
[1:09:59] <+xeros720> ZZ's music isn't terribly memorable to me
[1:10:00] <%Axle13j> jump and shoot man
[1:10:00] <SoromopsEX> Ty means Thank You
[1:10:02] <+TheKeyLimit> Nothing guilty about BF, it is a love letter to gundam fans
[1:10:04] <KeroKamina> SHINIGN FINGAR
[1:10:05] <HelluvaNohbody> YO G GUNDAM

[1:10:06] <%Axle13j> FLY IN THE SKYYY
[1:10:07] <SpaceGuntank> FLY THE SKY
[1:10:08] <cheesedburgers> No offense but ZZ actually rules
[1:10:09] <Super_Voltekka> Who here remembers that time in 08th MS Team where a bunch of kids started skinnydipping for no reason?
[1:10:13] <BlackermanZX> THE GUN
[1:10:13] <GeltonZ> Rising Gundam and Speigel are my favorites in this. They feel REAL nice. Learning Kapool too.
[1:10:13] <%SilverRoddo> “How many times do have to see that child die!?”
[1:10:14] <spirittiart> @blank9 Katzura da
[1:10:16] <zer0enixx> Oh ok np 👍
[1:10:17] <+humbelpie> pls play burning/god gundam it is best gundam
[1:10:18] <+xeros720> yeah, ZZ is good, i just don't remember the music
[1:10:23] <dmstiles> 0079 holds up. It's pretty good
[1:10:27] <%Reverend_Roscoe> this song is the only good thing about G gundam
[1:10:31] <storytayl0r> okay, now someone HAS to pick a G Gundam character
[1:10:35] <+Tacotouchdown> @soromopsex READ THE MANGA INSTEAD
[1:10:39] <+TheKeyLimit> The novel for 08th ms team is so fucked up man
[1:10:45] <SoromopsEX> There´s a Manga?
[1:10:46] <DedlokPM> @cheesedburgers woolie talks about why he does not like like zz earlier
[1:10:49] <+humbelpie> the best unit in this game is the Mack Knife
[1:10:59] <Jashter18> G Gundam OP lets go
[1:11:07] <BlackermanZX> Is Wing Zero EW here?
[1:11:10] <Bustahhwulf> teach them bd hop
[1:11:19] <dmstiles> Zz is acceptable if you start halfway through and burn the rest lol
[1:11:23] <+Tacotouchdown> @soromopsex its a retelling but it infinitely better if you like reading plus no bad animation
[1:11:23] <%Axle13j> EZ 8 is amazing in cannon mode during burst
[1:11:26] <%ChoculaUltra> nice block
[1:11:27] <%uhgoat> AYYYY I've been waiting for woolie to get on this
[1:11:29] <neozz13> i was going to pick Mack Knife but woolie talked shit about zZ
[1:11:48] <%SilverRoddo> Gundam Meisters are never alone.
[1:11:51] <+Tonku_the_Red> @BlackermanZX It's in the game, yes.
[1:11:52] <SoromopsEX> Okay gotcha imma take that into Consideration thank you!! @Tacotouchdown
[1:11:53] <Blank9> alex was my favorite low cost, I wish it came back
[1:11:58] <Blank9> that armor was stupid
[1:11:58] <andre11dr> All the main Endless Waltz suites are in this
[1:12:12] <SpaceGuntank> Alex is in MBON though
[1:12:12] <+xeros720> i wish we could convince woolie to try out gundam battle operation 2 as well
[1:12:13] <%ChoculaUltra> monkaS
[1:12:16] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @Tacotouchdown th e bad animation is part of the charm
[1:12:19] <%ChoculaUltra> ah damn
[1:12:20] <taquito_blade> Woolie does this have any relation to Gundam Versus system wise?
[1:12:21] <neozz13> @Blank9 in tho
[1:12:25] <Dante_Namikaze1> SHINING FINGER
[1:12:29] <+RenoDeGeneric> Alex is in this game
[1:12:33] <andre11dr> Wing and 00 got shit loads of representation in this
[1:12:36] <%uhgoat> what's your favorite mobile suit @woolieversus
[1:12:37] <+Tacotouchdown> @soromopsex np is call Mobile suit gundam the Origin
[1:12:40] <+Tonku_the_Red> The whole team was there. That was rad.
[1:12:44] <CrookedNoseArts> canonical end for the Ez8
[1:12:45] <Blank9> god this is way better than that other ps4 one then
[1:12:50] <%Axle13j> @taquito_blade yes, they play almost identically. This doesn't have a down boost though, and its a bit faster
[1:12:50] <stormhawk9891> Does he know how to do supers yet?
[1:12:53] <zer0enixx> Theres 3 compilation movies for 79
[1:12:53] <arkv01> just got here, whats up with the sick gameboy chiptune?
[1:12:59] <SoromopsEX> Thank yaaa
[1:13:01] <Blank9> alex and hambrabi for life, I was scum
[1:13:06] <+atin2000> Im a huge 00 fan, and massive exia fan, and even I think exia has to many suits
[1:13:06] <Bustahhwulf> use gpo3
[1:13:08] <zer0enixx> Theyre on youtube rn
[1:13:10] <%HeroVersusOfficial> Cheer500 I guess to give a small preview, we've been working with the weave mechanic. There are particle effects once you go into champ mode where you'll actually see a reapers aura while you're weaving and such. Likewise in critical mode (under 20% health) AND champion mode, you gain the ability to "store" weaves. You lose speed while this effect is active, but you'll automatically evade incoming attacks while walking (not dashing) forward and retaining the ability to cancel into other moves.
[1:13:23] <+Tonku_the_Red> @arkv01 To avoid possible copyright strikes, he muted the game music and played this.
[1:13:25] <dmstiles> BOperation is quite slow though. Don't think woolie would like it
[1:13:26] <Blank9> x2 is also amazing
[1:13:26] <andre11dr> FAZ is big heavy
[1:13:27] <+Tacotouchdown> Gundam 00 is awesome
[1:13:28] <arkv01> ah nice
[1:13:30] <neozz13> i would not advise the movies in replacement for 0079
[1:13:30] <GeltonZ> @taquito_blade It's the superior predecessor. Whenever the Gundam Versus series restarts the first game in the series feels like a downgrade. I hear Gundam Versus 2 is great.
[1:13:35] <Krosscross> fazz chungus
[1:13:40] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @SoromopsEX If you don't want to commit to a 40 episode show from the 70's, the 3 movies are on the official bandai channel
[1:13:41] <spirittiart> beyond time
[1:13:41] <+JackalKing> G Gundam is best Gundam
[1:13:45] <townzzzzz> beyond thetime

[1:14:12] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Operation Infinite Justice
[1:14:14] <TuxedoNash> Reggie's in his head now
[1:14:14] <stormhawk9891> Just watch 00 instead
[1:14:16] <SoromopsEX> Gotcha, thanks!! @Reverend_Roscoe
[1:14:17] <TuxedoNash> rent free
[1:14:18] <CrookedNoseArts> Strike Freedom
[1:14:18] <$silentblast93> operation roaring freedom
[1:14:20] <%Axle13j> SourPls
[1:14:22] <+humbelpie> fun fact: Athruns English VA is Double D from Ed, Edd n Eddy
[1:14:24] <+HeadBread> Strike Freedom time
[1:14:25] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @SoromopsEX NP
[1:14:30] <+Tacotouchdown> Seed destiny is half good then a hard nose dive
[1:14:36] <Bustahhwulf> FREEDOM GUNDAM OF CHINA
[1:14:36] <+Tonku_the_Red> SEED had some rad suits. The characters though. . .ugh.
[1:14:40] <+shivvey> STRIKE FREEDOM IS THE BEST NAME
[1:14:42] <+humbelpie> Kira Yamato is Ed
[1:14:42] <+meowarco> Reggie would probably like the Throne Gundams from 00 than vampybitmeChill
[1:14:42] <chaos2frozen> Infinite Justice is cool though
[1:14:43] <Blank9> athrun did nothing wrong
[1:14:43] <+RenoDeGeneric> Can Infinite Justice use its shin blades?
[1:14:43] <+xeros720> that's why Seed is so bad
[1:14:46] <supakaminarikun> ANIME NA JAI
[1:14:47] <+xeros720> it's sometimes good
[1:14:52] <stormhawk9891> Yo that Beyond the Time tho
[1:14:56] <+humbelpie> Tieria from 00 is also Double D
[1:14:57] <+xeros720> and so you suffer through all the trash
[1:14:59] <Dante_Namikaze1> the S4ike Freedom is the only good thing to come out of Destiny
[1:15:01] <%Axle13j> They forgot to panel line LUL
[1:15:04] <neozz13> only good character in SEED is Dearka
[1:15:04] <+Tacotouchdown> Yo know china picked the Freedom as a statue, because its called "Freedom"
[1:15:06] <Burningjaso> beyond the time
[1:15:07] <Baconrath> im so bad at this game lmao
[1:15:18] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @SoromopsEX The movies obviously feel a little more fast paced, since it's compressing like 6 months or something into 6 hours as opposed to like 20 hours
[1:15:25] <Dante_Namikaze1> @neozz13 Mu La Flaga was cool too
[1:15:28] <TuxedoNash> hit em with the backpack
[1:15:35] <%Axle13j> hold square
[1:15:37] <+omegasis> ok but why's no one playing as the wheel, the best mobile suit
[1:15:44] <+TheKeyLimit> Perfect strike is so underutilized it's criminal and im so mad
[1:15:48] <SpaceGuntank> you have to be careful though, some suits can only charge certain weapons once per life.
[1:15:51] <Blank9> messala's charge for missiles is great
[1:15:53] <CrookedNoseArts> Don't forget Andrew Waltfeld
[1:15:54] <%SilverRoddo> I feel Woolie would tear down that Freedom Gundam under protest.
[1:15:56] <SoromopsEX> @Reverend_Roscoe Gotcha, thanks again! Been meaning to get into Gundam for a while so tysm!!
[1:16:01] <Super_Voltekka> THIS AIN'T NO ANIME
[1:16:04] <supakaminarikun> ZZ can do spinning suplec
[1:16:08] <andre11dr> Yo ,but for real, Nu Gundam is the most clean design for an actual Gundam in the hole series
[1:16:20] <+humbelpie> the best mobile suit is the Mack Knife because it has crotch rockets
[1:16:20] <andre11dr> It's so good
[1:16:28] <+TheKeyLimit> Personally tho, Hi-Nu > Nu gundam Okawara and Katoki
[1:16:28] <TuxedoNash> yo that backpack get em
[1:16:29] <dmstiles> My opinion on seed aside the mobius zero was sick
[1:16:30] <zer0enixx> @andre11dr The exia says hi
[1:16:30] <%Axle13j> Nu Gundam is fantastic
[1:16:41] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @andre11dr Turn A
[1:16:48] <Dante_Namikaze1> @thekeylimit the Perfect Strike is so cool

[1:19:35] <SpaceGuntank> mash triangle during the flip to launch missiles.
[1:19:35] <andre11dr> Heavy Arms is fun ,but Psycho Zaku is just better in every way and it's the same principle
[1:19:37] <+TheKeyLimit> In this version, It does have 2 barrels though
[1:19:44] <%Axle13j> Lets say best thing, rather

[1:21:08] <SomersaultJustice> AMERICA
[1:21:15] <Baconrath> Ive heard that some people rebind some of the buttons to the triggers so its less awkward to hold buttons for charge moves while moving at the same time
[1:21:16] <Lieutori> Theme music wins
[1:21:19] <+shivvey> GIVE THEM THE FREEDOM
[1:21:23] <%Axle13j> I wish Gundam Maxter was in this
[1:21:25] <Lieutori> Reggie had SEED music advantage
[1:21:28] <+shivvey> The freedom to DIE
[1:21:29] <FreedomARX7> OG Freedom
[1:21:31] <Spirit_NB> I put shoot and melee on the bumpers myself

[1:21:51] <Dante_Namikaze1> RIP all this time and there's still no Crossbone anime
[1:21:59] <foiledyetagain> like learning to only boost, hop and sidestep for movement is the most important things imo
[1:22:00] <+TheMismatcher> Ikr Crossbone is so good
[1:22:01] <maverickdrifter> Remember when amuro became a cop for a fascist police state
[1:22:04] <%Axle13j> Full Cloth is so good
[1:22:04] <biomegabear> yep

[1:22:28] <biomegabear> I'm surprise how he lives in destiny
[1:22:29] <GeneralHysterics> "man, this story sucks. I'ma head out"
[1:22:29] <zer0enixx> Gary stu the protag
[1:22:30] <@Menitta> how about we say AAAUUUAAAGHAAAAGGUUGAGA
[1:22:30] <%SilverRoddo> I often listen back to Woolie’s Gundam Seed rant, it’s a great promo.
[1:22:33] <%Josef_Stryker> AUGHAUGHAUGHAUGHAUGH
[1:22:39] <+Tonku_the_Red> Please ley Kira Yamato go AEEEEUUGUHEUEUUE when he dies.
[1:22:40] <%Axle13j> aeueauaueauauauagh
[1:22:40] <+TheKeyLimit> Like, in Seed Kira wasn't so bad
[1:22:46] <+TheKeyLimit> But Destiny just made him invincible
[1:22:46] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Quick question, I have the anime music pack downloaded. if I play woolz and reggie, will that play? worried about them getting a vod mute.
[1:22:46] <zer0enixx> Kira ruins seed destiny
[1:22:47] <Cecion> everyone at the mercy of unstable space psychics in the end
[1:22:49] <Klefth> Why is that style of mechanical wings the coolest fucking thing ever?
[1:22:49] <Blank9> someone tell woolie to charge melee
[1:22:52] <+TheKeyLimit> Shinn deserved better
[1:22:53] <EL_TRO> Use the boost to get through @WoolieVersus
[1:22:53] <maverickdrifter> @reverend_roscoe tomino said please don’t pilot a gundam
[1:22:53] <Dante_Namikaze1> @silverroddo it's one of the best like Woolie hates Breakfast
[1:22:55] <+Tacotouchdown> JESUS Yamato here fucking up Shin Asuka's story
[1:22:57] <DedlokPM> For those that do not know: Reggie's character is the guy that is crying on the space ship in Woolie's Outro
[1:23:00] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @maverickdrifter Judau, Kamille, and Uso are like the only ones who don't fall into the trap
[1:23:02] <CrookedNoseArts> LUL
[1:23:03] <EL_TRO> never walk always boost
[1:23:05] <biomegabear> her song silent night? weird
[1:23:17] <KeroKamina> this is a 00 song rihgt?
[1:23:17] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @maverickdrifter yeah, but wow cool robot always wins
[1:23:27] <%HeroVersusOfficial> Cheer500 Assuming you have a weave(s) stored, the reaper aura will persist around you to indicate it. This should give you the literal [menacing] feel when playing, walking threateningly towards the opponent and avoiding their attacks while on death's door.. In addition, while in this specific form, your moves gain extra range.. Your strikes split the air, but the flash gives the appearance of a blade of a scythe reaping reality itself. This ultimate final technique is the true "Reaper's Fist".
[1:23:27] <TigerClaws12> to be fair, Shinn was unsalvageable LUL
[1:23:29] <Bustahhwulf> funnels and bits will hit if you arent bd
[1:23:30] <+Tacotouchdown> lacus more like trashuc
[1:23:31] <maverickdrifter> Can’t stop thinking how cool that robot is
[1:23:31] <%Axle13j> @AlteisenReiseZ I think they straight up have the music turned off
[1:23:34] <Super_Voltekka> I still remember when SEED Destiny was listed in the Top 20 of a poll conducted by the NHK for "bEsT aNiMoo EvArZZ"
[1:23:35] <neozz13> in what universe do most gundam protags become fascists the hell
[1:23:36] <%SilverRoddo> I need to get on that Woolz Hates Breakfast woolieOMG
[1:23:37] <%Axle13j> sourpls
[1:23:45] <+TheKeyLimit> SRW made Shinn and Kira way better characters and are how Seed and Destiny should've gone
[1:23:46] <+ChancellorOfLights> Is Domon Kasshu in this game? That's literally the only character I know by name
[1:23:47] <andre11dr> The laser shields on the X are really cool
[1:23:47] <@Moobot> Easy with the emojis @zashzila
[1:23:56] <biomegabear> @tigerclaws12 shinn has been through so much he might as well be evil
[1:23:57] <+TheKeyLimit> I love how everyone in SRW collectively went damn kira you're actually kinda stupid bro wake up
[1:23:57] <%Axle13j> @ChancellorOfLights Yup
[1:23:58] <townzzzzz> OO gundam intro

[1:24:07] <+Tacotouchdown> @chancelloroflights yes 2 times
[1:24:10] <Spirit_NB> Both Domon's suits are in the game. Shining and Burning
[1:24:12] <+ChancellorOfLights> Nice!
[1:24:13] <supakaminarikun> Kira not KILLIT
[1:24:19] <zashzila> They aren't boosting.
[1:24:23] <TigerClaws12> @biomegabear cowards, the lot of the writers LUL
[1:24:26] <Rangenade> Reggie proves that Seed wins again Kappa Kappa
[1:24:30] <Dapper_Cactuar> doesn't one of the Crossbone versions have a "Get over here"?
[1:24:37] <Zouledge> @TigerClaws12 i disagree since kamille is like shin if done right but its kinda hard to do when you just stop trying to write the character half way through the series
[1:24:38] <SpaceGuntank> i hope they'll host a room at the end of this, i would really like to join in on it.
[1:24:51] <JaceDarkstar> I miss the gundam warriors games
[1:24:56] <%Josef_Stryker> BTW is Woolie gonna play anything else after this?
[1:25:10] <%Axle13j> This stage is cool though lol but yea
[1:25:13] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Hyrule Castle is at least, fun with people
[1:25:14] <UltimateAzure> @Dapper_Cactuar X2 has a grapple
[1:25:17] <foiledyetagain> landing after boosting is when you are most vulnerable
[1:25:17] <biomegabear> @tigerclaws12 someone had a cool fixing destiny thing too, where Shinn would defect to arc angel and I'm like that would work way better
[1:25:17] <andre11dr> Reggie really wants to fuck with Woolies head by keep picking SEED bullshit LUL
[1:25:26] <Lieutori> SAFETY KAIJOU
[1:25:28] <+TheKeyLimit> Gundam needs an armored core style game make an entirely new series
[1:25:31] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Is E.Z. 88 in this game?
[1:25:33] <GeneralHysterics> crossBONED
[1:25:37] <+TheKeyLimit> Yes @ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots
[1:25:38] <RyuuAoi> Press F if you have the game and wanna kick Woolie x Reggie ass
[1:25:42] <+Dova573> is rage of the dragons gonna be on fightcade or parsec?
[1:25:44] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @Josef_Stryker rage of dragons
[1:25:51] <SpaceGuntank> @RyuuAoi F LUL
[1:25:51] <Zouledge> @biomegabear i know im kinda just jumping in but i know the video youre talking about and i agree its pretty good
[1:25:52] <%Axle13j> (F)
[1:25:52] <neozz13> F
[1:25:52] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Does it suck, @TheKeyLimit ?
[1:25:56] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @Josef_Stryker at least that's what twitter says
[1:26:00] <AmericanaRed> shibuy4Pipimi 🛫
[1:26:00] <andre11dr> At least i think it's SEED ,i never actually watched the fucking thing
[1:26:06] <%wardogleader15> you guys are blocking a lot more than I normally do
[1:26:12] <CrookedNoseArts> Aren't there assists in this game?
[1:26:14] <supakaminarikun> WOOLIE YOU CAN SAVE UNIVERSE
[1:26:26] <AmericanaRed> 🛬 shibuy4Popuko
[1:26:27] <+TheKeyLimit> @ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots Im not too sure but the general consensus is that it's decent iirc
[1:26:31] <dmstiles> I kept hoping senki would get an english release but alas
[1:26:33] <+Tacotouchdown> Seed is too much mellow drama and preaching at you with its perfect character
[1:26:36] <biomegabear> @zouledge yeah my boi !!!!
[1:26:37] <UltimateAzure> @CrookedNoseArts Yes, but only certain suits have them
[1:26:39] <%Axle13j> @CrookedNoseArts Certain suits have an assist as part of their moveset, but that's it
[1:26:41] <Blank9> block is best for melee or supers
[1:26:43] <Zouledge> @wardogleader15 i tend to forget about blocking since boosting like its zone of the enders is easier
[1:26:44] <RyuuAoi> Many dead kids today...
[1:26:46] <+shivvey> Use them dragoonnnssss reggie
[1:26:47] <+TheKeyLimit> Why is Loran naked WTF
[1:26:47] <RF_Zechs> Reggie should pick the Lacus Infinite Justice and beat woolie for the one time
[1:26:49] <andre11dr> @crookednosearts Some suite's get assist as moves
[1:26:52] <Bustahhwulf> blocking is last second save block is not meta
[1:26:52] <supakaminarikun> NANTOOOOOOOOOO
[1:26:53] <GamerWorlock> blocking also gains meter
[1:26:54] <+TheKeyLimit> I know how he got naked but cmon
[1:26:56] <+TheKeyLimit> Use his pilot suit
[1:26:58] <%uhgoat> 00

[1:28:24] <+ElectricFoxLex> Hello Woolie
[1:28:25] <Zouledge> andrew is the chad of seed
[1:28:25] <GeneralHysterics> GO MEN NA SAI
[1:28:31] <zer0enixx> Look at the size of this lad
[1:28:33] <Rangenade> Nightingale looks more like a armored core mech than a gundam
[1:28:33] <RyuuAoi> Do! Fight! Win Reggie!
[1:28:39] <%Reverend_Roscoe> Am I the only one who dislikes the Nightingale design?
[1:28:40] <+amurter19> throw the turn A nuke
[1:28:42] <Dapper_Cactuar> Char's Counterattack Char with one of his suits has a super that just nukes a portion of the map
[1:28:47] <CrookedNoseArts> You bout to eat this stache
[1:28:52] <%subjectg> I much prefer the sazabi ovet the nightingale
[1:28:56] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> My gundam... HAS A MUSTACHE!!!!
[1:29:06] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @subjectg oh good, I'm not the only one
[1:29:07] <dmstiles> Damn! You guys weren't kidding. Thing is huge
[1:29:09] <%HeroVersusOfficial> Eekum Bokum
[1:29:09] <RyuuAoi> OOOOO
[1:29:18] <andre11dr> Let's go Char,kill that child
[1:29:21] <huskarl_zap> Is that the girl from that hentai? Kappa
[1:29:25] <Zouledge> @dmstiles its pretty dummy thicc not gonna lie
[1:29:26] <+TheKeyLimit> I'm always awestruck by the simple fact that Turn A gundam is designed by Syd it makes me so irrationally happy i am not sure why
[1:29:27] <Klefth> Some of these designs are sick, but I have no freaking idea about Gundam. I'm almost afraid to ask here, but... should I ever commit to watching it?
[1:29:30] <andre11dr> It wouldn't be the first time
[1:29:31] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Has anyone modded Domon's english VA into this?
[1:29:32] <%uhgoat> yeah I prefer sazabi a lot more
[1:29:44] <dmstiles> Yes
[1:29:46] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @Klefth yes
[1:29:48] <%subjectg> same with nu gundam > hi-nu
[1:29:53] <RyuuAoi> GET FUQ TURN A
[1:29:53] <%Reverend_Roscoe> Gundam is good
[1:29:55] <%Axle13j> @Klefth There are some stand alone series that make it easier to get in to
[1:30:06] <supakaminarikun> Char save the timeline
[1:30:08] <SpaceGuntank> i belive turn A's nuke is on its melee hold.
[1:30:09] <zer0enixx> @thekeylimit Hell yes
[1:30:11] <FennecZephyr> The first season of IBO was really good
[1:30:12] <Klefth> Ooh, which? @Axle13j
[1:30:13] <FennecZephyr> Same with 00
[1:30:18] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> @TheKeyLimit LUL NEVER doodBait doodBait limmyFlexR
[1:30:18] <+darkdopple> Have they been about the super?
[1:30:21] <+hoenhime344> music on fucking POINT
[1:30:27] <supakaminarikun> puru-chan!!
[1:30:30] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> GUNDAM ANIME KILLED MY BROTHER
[1:30:38] <%subjectg> the flying bell pepper
[1:30:41] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @Klefth There's three compilation movies on the official Bandai youtube that compress the original series into something more digestable
[1:30:42] <DedlokPM> DAMMIT, MOON MOON
[1:30:42] <+Tacotouchdown> Ibo is good gotta trim the Fat
[1:30:43] <JaceDarkstar> moon moon
[1:30:45] <+darkdopple> Supers I mean
[1:30:47] <RayCSmooth> oh god moon moon
[1:30:51] <dmstiles> 0079 and zeta for story, 0083 for the designs
[1:30:51] <foiledyetagain> when you learn about vernier, you start realizing how bad you were playing up to that point LuL
[1:30:51] <RyuuAoi> @buttstuff_n_coffeepots F
[1:30:53] <Zouledge> @FennecZephyr i agree and while i enjoy their seasons 2...there is a reason muh bael is such a meme
[1:30:58] <%subjectg> We don’t talk about moon moon
[1:30:59] <zer0enixx> Moon moon?
[1:31:00] <%Axle13j> As said, IBO and 00 are good starts. 08th MS Team is part of the original series timeline, but pretty stand alone, and only 12 episodes
[1:31:08] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @Klefth Give them a shot and if you like the themes etc, check out the original series
[1:31:08] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:31:12] <neozz13> @Reverend_Roscoe theyre worse than the original series
[1:31:14] <huskarl_zap> has anyone used a regular Zaku?
[1:31:26] <Blank9> careless whisper midi
[1:31:27] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> But in all seriousness @TheKeyLimit Gundamn is a big and xomplex series, so know that before jumping in
[1:31:38] <arkv01> yooo lesgo zeta beats
[1:31:42] <%jhans209> how os the origins anime
[1:31:44] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @neozz13 I understand and I prefer the series, but I think they're ok for a newbie to watch to see if they like it
[1:31:46] <foiledyetagain> @huskarl_zap the closest thing to that is bernie's custom zaku from 0080, the actual zaku 2 in the game is the one used by doan which has no weapons
[1:31:48] <%subjectg> Good ol’ Neil Sedaka
[1:31:56] <Zouledge> has anyone told them that their boost gauge instantly refills the moment they touch the ground ?
[1:31:57] <dmstiles> Aldnoah zero is good too
[1:31:59] <zer0enixx> Its best to start with uc
[1:32:06] <+amurter19> I got into Gundam last year and I've watched all the ice stuff. what a cool series that id find absolutely boring if I wasn't an adult lol
[1:32:10] <andre11dr> I really hope we see Io Flamin by the end of the night, either suite is fine
[1:32:16] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> It'd be cool if The Ideon was an unlockable secret in this game.
[1:32:27] <huskarl_zap> why is it in the game if it has no attacks
[1:32:33] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> I know there are no such things as unlockable secrets in video games anymore, but still...
[1:32:33] <%Axle13j> And there's always the OG series compilation movies, if you don't wanna watch the whole show. At that point you can just look up a timeline for the UC series. There's a lot lol
[1:32:36] <RyuuAoi> Why @woolieversus gettin' REKT so?
[1:32:37] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots You could never beat it
[1:32:48] <foiledyetagain> @huskarl_zap it focuses on melee but it throws rocks as it's main ranged option
[1:32:53] <Dementedpenguin> That Ideon movie was insane. Truly a Tomino work. LUL
[1:32:54] <%Solidnick18> reggie nooo
[1:32:57] <RyuuAoi> REGGIE TRUE GUNDAM FAN
[1:33:00] <emeraldchaos> I would never recommend someone watches the UC movies over the original series tbh
[1:33:05] <+cyankh_r> have you guys done the melee rainbow step yet?
[1:33:06] <TimetodiveLTX> yo gundam?
[1:33:06] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Everymatch could end with the complete destruction of mankind, @Reverend_Roscoe
[1:33:07] <supakaminarikun> Puru-twele finally kill char like she supposed
[1:33:08] <dmstiles> If you want a hardhitting war drama start with 0079
[1:33:08] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> No one wins
[1:33:10] <+Tacotouchdown> ideon and ZZ had a crossover
[1:33:14] <%Reverend_Roscoe> lol
[1:33:18] <+ElectricFoxLex> No it's regular shot
[1:33:19] <Baconrath> remember Kashatrya strikers from Gundam Versus Kappa
[1:33:22] <Levant_Ex> just poking my head in here.. is this an asian release? I didn't think this game was translated fully
[1:33:28] <TimetodiveLTX> ok real question, does this qualify as fisticuffs?
[1:33:28] <Baconrath> Oops! All gerobi
[1:33:30] <Rangenade> I like the Nightingale's proportions , looks more like a vehicle you control rather than an extension of your body
[1:33:31] <andre11dr> Now Reggie has to pick the Sinanju to make this canon
[1:33:32] <foiledyetagain> they got rid of the Ple navi in this game PepeHands
[1:33:33] <%SilverRoddo> Didn’t Little V get back into animes because of Seed woolieMIRIN
[1:33:33] <+cyankh_r> it has an enlgish release
[1:33:35] <+ElectricFoxLex> Regular shot os the beam follow up after her grab
[1:33:35] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @Levant_Ex no, english, I believe
[1:33:37] <Klefth> Thanks @Axle13j @Reverend_Roscoe
[1:33:39] <Blank9> I remember The O strikers from Versus
[1:33:39] <+amurter19> I bought this on is psn
[1:33:45] <+amurter19> us*
[1:33:45] <+cyankh_r> english Digital only
[1:33:46] <+Tacotouchdown> @levant_ex bare minimum was done
[1:33:48] <RyuuAoi> GET ONLINE BOIS
[1:33:48] <%Axle13j> Yea, but people trying to get into teh series tend to like the idea of the movies more, I've found. The full series was better for sure
[1:33:49] <biomegabear> there's lot of weirdos in post 00 series I never seen
[1:33:50] <Blank9> kono pressure-da, forever
[1:33:51] <%Axle13j> @Klefth sure thing
[1:33:52] <townzzzzz> game over
[1:33:54] <+xGreenflame> >Doan Zaku OH NONONO
[1:33:54] <Levant_Ex> *what*, they actually localized it? man.
[1:33:58] <Baconrath> Perfect Gundam dnoFLEX
[1:34:01] <Zouledge> @Levant_Ex it was released in the west just not dubbed
[1:34:04] <%subjectg> where’s BARZAM
[1:34:07] <zer0enixx> @levant_ex Us release. Dont think it had a physical release over here
[1:34:13] <andre11dr> Aren't the Try Star in this, i forget
[1:34:14] <Blank9> karate zaku
[1:34:14] <RyuuAoi> Oops! ALL GUNDAM
[1:34:17] <foiledyetagain> oh no
[1:34:20] <SpaceGuntank> Doan's Zaku is incredibly cheeky,
[1:34:20] <Levant_Ex> that's still more than I expected
[1:34:20] <foiledyetagain> doan, the meme man
[1:34:21] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @Klefth Do yourself a favor if you like the movies, definitely watch the show.
[1:34:24] <time_axis> the character from the cut episode
[1:34:25] <stormhawk9891> @WoolieVersus IBO Mobile Suits actually have 0 beam weapons whatsoever
[1:34:28] <zashzila> Doan's Zoku is had.
[1:34:32] <CrookedNoseArts> Let's go Dendrobium
[1:34:34] <%Eaglestrike117> Did he pick the rock
[1:34:35] <+TheKeyLimit> This Zaku is so based
[1:34:35] <+Tacotouchdown> BAEL
[1:34:36] <townzzzzz> ROCKS
[1:34:40] <%Axle13j> THROW THE ROCK PogChamp
[1:34:44] <TimetodiveLTX> yo ROCKS
[1:34:47] <huskarl_zap> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[1:34:48] <zer0enixx> This game has over 130 mobile suits
[1:34:54] <%Reverend_Roscoe> MOBILE SUIT MARTIAL ARTS
[1:34:56] <SpaceGuntank> that one punch does over 250 damage
[1:34:59] <TimetodiveLTX> YEAH
[1:35:00] <GeltonZ> I love the cost system because it lets you just be lots of Zakus.
[1:35:03] <RyuuAoi> Reggie just do a backflip and biff?
[1:35:04] <+TheKeyLimit> You call throwing rocks a martial art?
[1:35:05] <Blank9> anime ja nai
[1:35:06] <supakaminarikun> ANIME NA JAI
[1:35:06] <+TheKeyLimit> Hey, whatever works
[1:35:09] <TimetodiveLTX> TWO HANDED ROCK
[1:35:11] <%Reverend_Roscoe> ANIME JA NAI
[1:35:14] <%Axle13j> Hey, whatever works
[1:35:16] <HelluvaNohbody> Is that the Zaku from the episode Tomino hates?
[1:35:19] <KeroKamina> anime ja nai
[1:35:23] <supakaminarikun> ANKME JA NAI
[1:35:24] <%subjectg> ANIME JA NAI
[1:35:24] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @HelluvaNohbody YES
[1:35:28] <+Marchen144> Is this is custom music added via usb?
[1:35:30] <+Tacotouchdown> idc about the zaku but I like psycho Zaku and the Efreet
[1:35:32] <+amurter19> I watched victory gundam recently and expected garbage but I liked it lol
[1:35:35] <zer0enixx> NOT AN ANIME
[1:35:40] <dmstiles> Never finished 00, but always liked the flawed premise of some dumb teens trying to force world peace...through force lol
[1:35:46] <GeltonZ> @Marchen144 Nah they're just playing it over the game. Probably afraid of copyright strikes.
[1:35:49] <%Reverend_Roscoe> The Zaku that Reggie is playing is in an episode that was never released outside Japan
[1:35:51] <neozz13> i dont get it, if you wanted to get into the series for real, wqhy watch comps that are basically just a synopsis. might as well just read the wiki
[1:35:52] <JaceDarkstar> I log
[1:35:54] <Dementedpenguin> @amurter19 The opening episodes are clumsily directed but it grows from that.
[1:35:55] <%Axle13j> The only way to stop violence... is with more violence!
[1:35:56] <Spirit_NB> Rocks to the end, baby
[1:35:57] <%subjectg> @helluvanohbody something about “I won’t say anything so as long as that person is alive.”
[1:35:58] <SpaceGuntank> the rocks TRACK
[1:35:59] <+Marchen144> @GeltonZ Ahh yea that makes sense.
[1:36:20] <CrookedNoseArts> Good ol' rock, nothing beats rock
[1:36:28] <+Tacotouchdown> gp03 got some dodges
[1:36:31] <TimetodiveLTX> CONSECUTIVE ROCKS
[1:36:35] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @neozz13 not everyone is willing to make that kind of commitment. Maybe they don't know if they want to get into it for real?
[1:36:36] <JaceDarkstar> I love gundam unicorns base form the best
[1:36:41] <Zouledge> @dmstiles might i recommend IBO it has a similar premise of teens trying to leave the child soldier life by killing a whole bunch of people Kappa ?
[1:36:49] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @JaceDarkstar it is a CLEAN design
[1:36:56] <%subjectg> The Messala is one of my fav designs tbh
[1:37:05] <Blank9> let them know about specials by pressing burst again while in the mode
[1:37:06] <TimetodiveLTX> aww
[1:37:10] <%Axle13j> F
[1:37:10] <%subjectg> but if i gotta pick a feddie suit it’s the gm sniper
[1:37:27] <huskarl_zap> return to rock
[1:37:31] <+Marchen144> @WoolieVersus just fyi you can add custom music to this game via usb.
[1:37:33] <+Tacotouchdown> ibo is about Civil rights in the first season
[1:37:36] <GeltonZ> I dream of one day getting Zoloats.
[1:37:36] <+HeadBread> Is ball in the game?
[1:37:38] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> SHINING GUNDAM, SHINING GUNDAMN, SHINING GUNDAM macawRambo rgtAnimeRules macawRambo rgtAnimeRules macawRambo rgtAnimeRules
[1:37:41] <+henshin_a_nogo> y'all should try an arcade run before online, the bosses are real fun!
[1:37:41] <itsthelos> Where did all the rocks come from?
[1:37:48] <GeltonZ> @HeadBread No ball but they do have Kapool
[1:37:49] <foiledyetagain> bernie's zaku is what you want
[1:37:50] <zer0enixx> If u have the time watch 79 anime, if not, watch the comp movies, and then watch the episodes that they skip
[1:37:55] <andre11dr> Well, time to try to get FA in there
[1:37:59] <dmstiles> Messala= Gaplant+All the steroids
[1:37:59] <JaceDarkstar> @reverend_roscoe plus it makes the transition look even better
[1:38:05] <+HeadBread> Unfortunate, maybe one day

[1:39:36] <+gitgouda> i need this now
[1:39:45] <CrookedNoseArts> @Wool First op from G in Reconguista
[1:39:55] <KeroKamina> G-Reco's opening
[1:39:58] <+amurter19> there's a lot of hate but victory gundam is totally cool
[1:39:58] <%Wool> ahhh that's why it sounds familiar
[1:39:59] <andre11dr> It's like an Install
[1:40:02] <SpaceGuntank> the Voitrue Lumiere works great if you charge the gun, it gives special movement.
[1:40:09] <%SilverRoddo> Oh, Victory Gundam is like Shin’s combiner gundam from Seed Destiny.
[1:40:11] <+Tacotouchdown> G-reco great Op's and that orginal ED
[1:40:13] <neozz13> @Reverend_Roscoe then you would just stop watching would you not, im sure people can tell like even 5 eps in
[1:40:29] <+Tacotouchdown> done by the people who wrote GREAT DAYS
[1:40:35] <Zouledge> @ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots doodInjury doodCrazy
[1:40:55] <+ElectricFoxLex> You can
[1:41:00] <+TheKeyLimit> All gundams that can do what victory do all started from the granddaddy baby
[1:41:03] <SpaceGuntank> tap the same button IIRC
[1:41:04] <MagusKen> whats the chiptune music playing
[1:41:07] <zer0enixx> @silverroddo Its more like the other way around
[1:41:08] <CrookedNoseArts> zap
[1:41:11] <lem______> G reco op 1
[1:41:16] <foiledyetagain> thing its been a month since release, so all the people left are the major tryhards LuL
[1:41:17] <RF_Zechs> Hey that suit woolie is using looks like the nepteight gundam Kappa
[1:41:22] <+Tacotouchdown> @magusken G reco op1
[1:41:23] <+gitgouda> how much is this on ps4?
[1:41:27] <dmstiles> Unicorn gundam never made much sense. Suddenly psychframe needs to be exposed to work? Also creating vulnerabilities everywhere aspsychframe is not armor
[1:41:31] <+cyankh_r> 60 bucks
[1:41:37] <+Tacotouchdown> @gitgouda 60 sorry
[1:41:37] <lem______> wait does woolie push greco?
[1:41:42] <zer0enixx> @gitgouda Full price
[1:41:44] <+gitgouda> cool thank you guys.
[1:41:48] <+cyankh_r> id say its worth
[1:41:54] <+gitgouda> fuck someone release a pc gundam game please
[1:41:59] <+gitgouda> i mean thats good of course.
[1:42:01] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @Tacotouchdown @neozz13 I'm not saying that the movies are the better way to consume the OG gundam, but if someone wants a bite size taste to see if they like it, then why not watch them?
[1:42:01] <zer0enixx> Seriously
[1:42:06] <+Kqha4000> rawr?
[1:42:07] <+cyankh_r> theres some decent single player
[1:42:14] <SpaceGuntank> @dmstiles the shield has a built in I-Field for defense, and it also natrually counteracts funnels which was the main weapon at the time
[1:42:15] <%Lewdicrus00Q> it's worth, if you're willing to put in the work, like qny fighting game

[1:57:14] <Zouledge> @Axle13j i learned that the hard way with constantly trying to destiny fingah people only to get blown up for it
[1:57:17] <time_axis> they didnt build the legs yet
[1:57:23] <%Axle13j> @Zouledge LUL

[1:57:58] <+cyankh_r> RG Zeong gonna be hype
[1:58:06] <GeltonZ> @SoromopsEX That it is! Means none of these suits are half-assed!
[1:58:06] <+MTLxSpider> "no sorry stay there"
[1:58:07] <SpaceGuntank> BD1's special involves throwing an allied GM at you. think about that LUL
[1:58:10] <CrookedNoseArts> This is a cool stage
[1:58:10] <%tinyswampthing> rg zeong is gonna be huge
[1:58:11] <+Tonku_the_Red> Zeong's not really a "monster of the week" though. He was Char's personal suit in the 3rd MSG movie.
[1:58:13] <%Axle13j> @Zouledge double shining lets go? LUL
[1:58:15] <+MTLxSpider> what a god

[1:58:34] <RyuuAoi> Wow
[1:58:35] <SoromopsEX> @GeltonZ That´s why I even asked, all of them seem so well made in terms of Gameplay so I was like WOW
[1:58:37] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Roger that
[1:58:38] <dmstiles> Built fighters: ok we'll have one episode where someone uses strategy, but have the other guy win cause plot armor
[1:58:50] <@Menitta> Now I want Woolie and Reggie to stream Gundam Breaker 3
[1:58:53] <%DSD24> Duo Maxwell
[1:58:54] <%subjectg> don’t worry, there’ll be another war with even cooler mobile suits
[1:58:56] <@Menitta> That game is the shit
[1:59:00] <neozz13> @Tonku_the_Red yes it is, its one of the several suits that only lasted 2 eps
[1:59:00] <Shyakuuu> BD PogChamp
[1:59:08] <+MTLxSpider> Duo and Throwa are basically yun yang yeah
[1:59:09] <Zouledge> @dmstiles but its just so a meijin Kappa

[2:00:26] <andre11dr> Witch suits in this have the final stand thing?I know RX-78 and the Haiaku-Shiki have it
[2:00:28] <SoromopsEX> I KNOW RIGHT
[2:00:28] <Zouledge> @Axle13j i say try out a bunch of different suitts, for example destiny has a big ass sword and destiny fingah but basically has an answer for all ranges. what im trying to say its that it deserved better than shin
[2:00:30] <%SilverRoddo> Altron’s long arm would be, in theory, overpowered.
[2:00:30] <supakaminarikun> NANTOOOOOOO music

[2:10:03] <+cyankh_r> I ALMOST GOT IN
[2:10:04] <townzzzzz> BIG NUMBERS
[2:10:05] <%DSD24> Domon
[2:10:09] <%wardogleader15> Run away from that Burning Gundam
[2:10:10] <OToole42> AYYYY G Gundam
[2:10:11] <+jahansoundsystem> X3 works just as well
[2:10:12] <+Tacotouchdown> wings have "thrusters"
[2:10:19] <+maenos2> burning gundam is so much a better name than god though
[2:10:21] <Zouledge> @Shyakuuu very good and very easy to use
[2:10:21] <%Axle13j> I will never not call it Burning gundam lul
[2:10:22] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Domon about to run wild
[2:10:23] <%Reverend_Roscoe> PHRASING
[2:10:24] <+RealThiele> weak-ass wing flap
[2:10:28] <Shyakuuu> Manga made the wings make more sense
[2:10:28] <Bustahhwulf> u can shoot and switch targets and shoot with the other rifle
[2:10:30] <Super_Voltekka> And the Shadow Gundam is actually Devil Gundam
[2:10:33] <+atin2000> oh good, one of those "god is its real name" losers
[2:10:38] <@Menitta> WHY IS THAT SO COOL THO
[2:10:39] <huskarl_zap> made from seagulls
[2:10:41] <time_axis> that's only the name in Wing I think
[2:10:41] <+senfood> The wings always looked like that shut up
[2:10:44] <SoromopsEX> CAHMBOS
[2:10:46] <dmstiles> Sooo can the zero custom ever lose all its feathers?
[2:10:46] <+Marchen144> X3 here we goooo
[2:10:51] <neozz13> @maenos2 God was the name because it beats the Devil gundam, so burning doesnt work
[2:10:52] <+henshin_a_nogo> oooo that's a spicy crossbone
[2:11:00] <DedlokPM> @huskarl_zap Gundanium Seagulls
[2:11:01] <+amurter19> I think in build fighters it really is called burning gundam. idunno
[2:11:02] <Zouledge> @Super_Voltekka i thought shadow was the german ninja ? do you mean dark gunda ?
[2:11:03] <+Tacotouchdown> EW was just Unicorn but not dragged out across 7eps and evil
[2:11:04] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @WoolieVersus they're segmented
[2:11:10] <$infinite_rotation> I love that the wings have actual fucking feathers!
[2:11:14] <%Axle13j> But in the english version devil gundam is just dark gundam so they made it work LUL
[2:11:17] <Lieutori> SAFETY KAIJOU
[2:11:18] <CrookedNoseArts> I prefer God/Devil gundam vs Burning/Dark
[2:11:18] <townzzzzz> LUL
[2:11:19] <andre11dr> Yeah ,X2 and X3 will do that to you
[2:11:19] <+maenos2> @neozz13 I realize but burning is cooler and fits with Domon better anyway. "This hand of mine is burning red" etc etc.
[2:11:24] <%Solidnick18> noooo
[2:11:28] <+Tacotouchdown> Dark gundam is ok
[2:11:29] <zer0enixx> GGs

[2:19:35] <Nekros4442> WOOLIE HAS THE RIGHT REAECTION

[2:20:02] <%tinyswampthing> turn x is super good
[2:20:04] <@Menitta> gang up on that kapool
[2:20:10] <+atin2000> @SoromopsEX they have much higher damage, but usually fewer range tools
[2:20:12] <+henshin_a_nogo> @SoromopsEX think High risk High reward. melee combos do more than beams and whatnot, but getting close enough for melees is very difficult
[2:20:15] <%tinyswampthing> if wantred to really learn a 3k id be this one
[2:20:16] <biomegabear> turn x is fun
[2:20:17] <Blank9> is strike noir in this one?

[2:25:51] <MonochromeMemory> never ever engage a Bael in melee
[2:25:52] <RyuuAoi> Space make undo some crazy shit.
[2:25:54] <law240> @WoolieVersus is a FEDDIE OP
[2:25:56] <shitthedd> bael stairway to heaven
[2:25:57] <%Eaglestrike117> STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN
[2:25:58] <%AlteisenReiseZ> UNGA
[2:25:59] <kehnimentu> ladder match now
[2:26:00] <+ElectricFoxLex> No Reborns is the best
[2:26:00] <%DSD24> Orga is cool, Mika is a sociopath
[2:26:00] <MonochromeMemory> Baels eat melee suits for breakfast
[2:26:02] <+ItsAGundamu> Bael is insanely good melee but garbage range
[2:26:06] <brunoberserk> the crimson comet
[2:26:09] <MonochromeMemory> but they cannot do much at range
[2:26:10] <Hornssa> jesus
[2:26:10] <+atin2000> I mean, technically reborns is better, but its harder to use
[2:26:11] <foiledyetagain> machine gun suits aren't good for beginners tbh
[2:26:13] <%Wool> LETS GO BAEL
[2:26:13] <PanicSwytch> RAIIISE YOUR FLAAAAG
[2:26:17] <+Goblin01> Bounce Bounce baby
[2:26:19] <DedlokPM> RAISE YOUR FLAG!
[2:26:19] <Reizie_Etherealm> BAEL IS FED
[2:26:20] <alextrebeken> so its not that woolie sucks, is that theyre teir whoring
[2:26:23] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Oh my god they're just bullying him
[2:26:23] <Reizie_Etherealm> BAEL IS FED AF
[2:26:24] <%Axle13j> bodied lol
[2:26:25] <Zouledge> @andre11dr true, gundam sadly dosent have a lot of female pilots so that may be why Kappa
[2:26:28] <Spirit_NB> Bael is actually top tier? I just assumed it's a scrub stomper
[2:26:28] <biomegabear> that thing 8s nuts it's like freedom plus destiny
[2:26:29] <TigerClaws12> BAEL IS FED
[2:26:31] <mecha_soul> No more newtypes just Bael
[2:26:32] <blackcloud288> WHO FED BAEL
[2:26:32] <SoromopsEX> Bael feels like he gets in EASY
[2:26:40] <+jahansoundsystem> BAEL IS FED
[2:26:42] <MonochromeMemory> Naw, Woolie's pretty bad, but Bael-ing a new player is Bullying
[2:26:45] <+Tacotouchdown> BAEL IS FED
[2:26:46] <+Kqha4000> wasn't that called Schwartz gundam or am I misrembering
[2:26:48] <KitsuneManami> Do they know that hey are being unfair to woolie? lol
[2:26:49] <Twon_From_Wakanda> I stopped buying these VS games bc I could never get a match going BibleThump
[2:26:53] <%SockNinja013> double suplex with shadow gundam though
[2:26:57] <huskarl_zap> that's a devil's name
[2:26:59] <RyuuAoi> This isn't canon @woolieversus
[2:26:59] <XxBigNerdxX> sorry if I get in again I'll switch gundams
[2:27:00] <+Tacotouchdown> Ez-8 is bottom
[2:27:01] <MonochromeMemory> I just chalk it up to Woolie not yet having found his Main yet
[2:27:05] <%Wool> IS WOOLIE GONNA PICK BAEL?
[2:27:05] <+ElectricFoxLex> No Bael is high tier but he's not the best 3000. That belongs to Reborns Gundam
[2:27:06] <%Axle13j> I love Shining's Izuna drop
[2:27:08] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> OWO
[2:27:09] <Reizie_Etherealm> OWO
[2:27:10] <+xGreenflame> Bael isn't the best suit but you need to now what options your suit has to stop it
[2:27:11] <+maenos2> god mr bushido's mask is so dumb
[2:27:11] <SoromopsEX> SusanOwO?
[2:27:11] <%DSD24> Masks are cool
[2:27:14] <+henshin_a_nogo> "how much does bael cost" your pride, dignity
[2:27:15] <+SilverDevilfish> Zengar Lite
[2:27:16] <zashzila> Young man

[2:28:15] <%Axle13j> Reggie press 2B LUL
[2:28:15] <MonochromeMemory> if I can make a suit recommendation for an absolute newbie, I'd suggest the Gundam Banshee.
[2:28:17] <townzzzzz> Mr. Bushido
[2:28:19] <blackcloud288> you can't kill them by posing at them
[2:28:24] <law240> STFU TRY IS GREAT
[2:28:24] <+Kqha4000> Try>Divers
[2:28:25] <CrookedNoseArts> Tri is alright but not nearly as good
[2:28:26] <@Menitta> I gotta keep watching 00
[2:28:27] <MonochromeMemory> it's pretty basic and acts like a Berserker Unit
[2:28:29] <+Jaysky> I had thought Try was supposed to be good
[2:28:30] <Reizie_Etherealm> NANDATO?
[2:28:30] <Dante_Namikaze1> Try was the second season
[2:28:32] <neozz13> Char fans will see Char grooming a girl in CCA and go yeah thats the pricipality
[2:28:32] <Bustahhwulf> tri is great drivers sucked
[2:28:33] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> The Build Fighters series are waaaay too anime for me
[2:28:34] <KeroKamina> TRY was very G-gundam esc
[2:28:34] <%tinyswampthing> so i have the model of this suit and its legs are so thin it cant stand on them
[2:28:34] <sendart> Divers is bad Divers Re:rise is great
[2:28:35] <+NekoNinja13> watch Re:Rise @woolieversus
[2:28:37] <KazMkII> Divers Re:Rise is best Build Fighters
[2:28:37] <neozz13> Fuck Char
[2:28:38] <%Lewdicrus00Q> yeah, TRY is awful
[2:28:41] <+Tacotouchdown> TRY IS NOT BAD
[2:28:42] <CrookedNoseArts> Divers is actually the worst
[2:28:44] <Spirit_NB> Try is fun
[2:28:46] <foiledyetagain> @neozz13 wow char is based
[2:28:47] <+Tacotouchdown> Fucking fight me
[2:28:47] <RyuuAoi> Woolie never watched Gundam.
[2:28:48] <Dante_Namikaze1> Divers was so boring
[2:28:49] <%Solidnick18> 00 intro song Kreygasm
[2:28:49] <+cyankh_r> Try is bad in really weird ways
[2:28:51] <foiledyetagain> Kappa
[2:28:51] <SoromopsEX> What would Gurren Lagann Mecha´s play like in this game lytEYES
[2:28:51] <+Mailboy> Divers is gross
[2:28:51] <MonochromeMemory> charge Melee transforms you into Destroy Mode where you just rip and tear
[2:28:54] <%Axle13j> Didn't like Try, it was ok tho
[2:28:56] <+henshin_a_nogo> everything post build fighters for the build stuff is really rough
[2:28:56] <Zouledge> try is okay but only good because MC is Domon's student which is though was neat
[2:28:57] <+Jaysky> So, how's Iron-Blooded Orphans?
[2:28:57] <Bustahhwulf> try legit is just a sequel divers is a shitty harem anime
[2:28:57] <Blank9> reggie spends the whole time posing
[2:28:58] <blackcloud288> Try is poor, but Divers and its ilk are GODFUCKINGAWFUL
[2:29:01] <neozz13> @foiledyetagain based ass
[2:29:05] <time_axis> Try just turned it from interesting battles to spam the super move to win every battle
[2:29:06] <KeroKamina> Divers is boring, Divers Re:Rise is actually pretty good
[2:29:07] <Lieutori> Susanowo really has to use its charge move for ranged attacks
[2:29:08] <MonochromeMemory> Woolz. please. Sub
[2:29:09] <%Lewdicrus00Q> AW YEAH, TURN A TURN
[2:29:11] <MonochromeMemory> SUB
[2:29:12] <+cyankh_r> IBO is averagw
[2:29:12] <+Tacotouchdown> try is only bad because it follows up Build Fighters
[2:29:17] <biomegabear> big work

[2:29:42] <+Marchen144> @Jaysky First season was pretty good. Second season does some dumb shit but it was ok at the end for me but just ok.
[2:29:45] <neozz13> @subjectg thats my most hated. THats why Hathaway is worse than Katz
[2:29:47] <%SockNinja013> burst Reggie!
[2:29:47] <dmstiles> Gurren lagann, fight until you become a galaxy

[2:29:51] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @Daxalog When is /m/ not mad?
[2:29:53] <kehnimentu> Where you at Gundam Tertiaries only playin SRW
[2:29:57] <+Tonku_the_Red> Woolie spent all day on MAHQ so he could pretend to be a Gundam fan.
[2:29:58] <Parapattern> Just like how Woolie pretends he can read
[2:30:05] <Blank9> the only good thing about hathaway is what happens to him
[2:30:08] <Blank9> fuck hathaway
[2:30:13] <+atin2000> @WoolieVersus thanks for the room, gg!
[2:30:14] <stormhawk9891> @kehnimentu Ye
[2:30:18] <biomegabear> @parapattern yeah, lol I see ya
[2:30:21] <neozz13> @Blank9 agreed
[2:30:21] <+Jaysky> @Marchen144 I just remember seeing a sick fight recommended to me, and it seemed like guerilla combat as opposed to space battles.
[2:30:24] <CrookedNoseArts> Gundam msia figures and bionicle was my childhood
[2:30:26] <Hornssa> penelope is hideous

[2:30:32] <%DSD24> Zaku Amazing!
[2:30:35] <%subjectg> @neozz13 it’s the best because it’s the worst. Yazan was a true hero because he killed katz and prevented terrible trio
[2:30:35] <%tinyswampthing> he should have never come out as brights dong
[2:30:35] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> I spent sooo much money importing sick Zoids when I was a kid
[2:30:37] <BlackermanZX> Fuck hataway
[2:30:39] <huskarl_zap> GOUF TROOP
[2:30:40] <+Kqha4000> how is vidar not in :(
[2:30:41] <RyuuAoi> Woolie can't read. He just senses energy from the text.

[2:31:07] <brunoberserk> origin is great !
[2:31:08] <foiledyetagain> excellia Pog
[2:31:09] <%wardogleader15> Thanks for the match! my OG (and Red Frame) vs 2 Acguys Cheer500
[2:31:11] <+NekoNinja13> Origin is good
[2:31:13] <Twon_From_Wakanda> Kappa
[2:31:16] <huskarl_zap> RARE GOLD GOOF PogChamp
[2:31:24] <%subjectg> Origin has some weird moments that i prefer the og over
[2:31:24] <biomegabear> hiene is a big jobber that dies fast
[2:31:24] <blackcloud288> Origin is dumb, dont bother
[2:31:27] <CrookedNoseArts> Ramba Ral the GOAT
[2:31:28] <DopeyDragon> Origin is great, but takes some liberties with the canon.
[2:31:33] <%tinyswampthing> Fun Fact bright was 19 in the og series
[2:31:35] <+NekoNinja13> RAMBA RAL IS MY HERO!
[2:31:37] <Zouledge> Ramba Ral is og chad of gundam
[2:31:44] <Bustahhwulf> excella kkenGASM
[2:31:47] <time_axis> Build Fighters universe is like Gundam Valhalla
[2:31:49] <%AlteisenReiseZ> OUUUF
[2:31:49] <RyuuAoi> @blackcloud288 NO. HE GOTTA KNOW.
[2:31:51] <andre11dr> Origins is really good, but it kinda pains Char as even more of an psycho
[2:31:51] <KeroKamina> i wish it was like the origin manga personally
[2:31:51] <neozz13> i rewatched Zeta this year, and while Katz is ass, he never gets anyone directly killed(but himself). Hathaway actually teamkills because muh feelings
[2:31:52] <%Reverend_Roscoe> BRIGHT WAS ONLY AN ENSIGN ON OG GUNDAM
[2:31:53] <%DSD24> @tinyswampthing What... I thought he was in his 20s
[2:32:01] <blackcloud288> Origin is like if Johnny Spaceboots made a Char prequel fanfic
[2:32:02] <stormhawk9891> Excellia has some UNGA BUNGA guns on her
[2:32:09] <Shyakuuu> The Origin is Charas drunken fanfiction of himself lol
[2:32:11] <Dante_Namikaze1> @tinyswampthing that man looked like he was permanently 30
[2:32:13] <ULT_13> i like excellia
[2:32:13] <%tinyswampthing> @DSD24 nope hes only like 2 years older than amuro
[2:32:15] <ULT_13> I LIKE GUN
[2:32:20] <Twon_From_Wakanda> They ever gonna make the 3rd Gundam Thunderbolt movie?
[2:32:21] <dmstiles> RambaRal=Everybody's cool uncle

[2:32:26] <biomegabear> @bustahhwulf yeah 2hats the deal with that? is that a magical girl style gundam?
[2:32:29] <Ragnorok64> can the Zudah self destruct in this game?
[2:32:29] <@Menitta> how many people here are trying to get a game in that havent
[2:32:32] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @tinyswampthing 4, Amuro is like 26
[2:32:36] <%Reverend_Roscoe> 16
[2:32:36] <neozz13> @DSD24 no the series litterally says hes 19 when he first shows up
[2:32:37] <%Axle13j> Me lol
[2:32:49] <%subjectg> Bright is a damn hero for having managed that hormone-ridden high-stress environment at 19

[2:36:20] <Reizie_Etherealm> Close but no cigar
[2:36:25] <foiledyetagain> i'm waiting for the 0079 blu rays to be restocked before starting gundam, but just to spite woolie i ain't skipping zz Kappa

[2:36:43] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @foiledyetagain dONT, ITS GOOD
[2:36:43] <Twon_From_Wakanda> If the next person to get in wanna pick the 00 Gundam that would be nice SeemsGood
[2:36:49] <andre11dr> I just realized that Jerek is voiced by the same guy that did Kars
[2:36:52] <%SockNinja013> wanted to show off trans-amm combo but got cut out
[2:36:56] <blackcloud288> Dont skip ZZ, it's actually better than people who never watched it say.
[2:37:01] <+Zahlzeit> @WoolieVersus apparently all the models are based on the mg models, that's why qube has the engraving on the back it's from the mg, and some suits have dents where they saved plastic
[2:37:01] <%Axle13j> Dangit lol
[2:37:04] <time_axis> @foiledyetagain Don't skip ZZ, just prepare for tonal whiplash in the beginning
[2:37:06] <DopeyDragon> Is Mk. II in this game?
[2:37:10] <FreedomARX7> yes
[2:37:11] <+Tacotouchdown> the cheridum is a great 2.5k sit
[2:37:11] <+henshin_a_nogo> If I got in I would have picked Raphael I love that suit. Would have loved to get that dempsey roll ya feel
[2:37:14] <foiledyetagain> @Reverend_Roscoe i heard it's a bit polarizing, but going in i already know i like ZZ, the qubeley and Puru Kappa
[2:37:15] <FreedomARX7> both versons
[2:37:20] <%Reverend_Roscoe> ZZ good after tonal backlash wears off
[2:37:20] <DopeyDragon> @FreedomARX7 based
[2:37:28] <%Axle13j> sourpls
[2:37:28] <+Tacotouchdown> Boo
[2:37:28] <%subjectg> ZZ is okay, but god are those first 20 or so episodes pretty bad
[2:37:30] <%DSD24> Blue Destiny Baby!
[2:37:36] <+Jaysky> Is that burning finger man?
[2:37:40] <+Tacotouchdown> Going back the Eternal Wind
[2:37:41] <dmstiles> Saw the mk2 earlier
[2:37:41] <Shyakuuu> I thought ZZ was fine tbh
[2:37:43] <%Axle13j> No
[2:37:46] <DopeyDragon> Moon Moon is not that bad. Fight me.
[2:37:47] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @subjectg not even 20, like 10
[2:37:50] <townzzzzz> beyond the time
[2:37:55] <+NekoNinja13> ZZ gets good after tomino stops trying to kill gundam due to depression
[2:37:57] <emeraldskrull> woolieDATTEBAYO_BW
[2:37:57] <biomegabear> I'll kill you vs I am gundam
[2:37:57] <%wardogleader15> FreedomARX7 Why u no Arbalest
[2:38:01] <+Pulsewing> The beginning of ZZ was just the writers doing self care after the ending of Zeta
[2:38:03] <andre11dr> Im trying so hard to get Io Flamin on screen right now NotLikeThis
[2:38:05] <FreedomARX7> i love Arbalest
[2:38:09] <%subjectg> @reverend_roscoe overestimated, i’ll own up to that
[2:38:14] <%wardogleader15> How bout Laevatien?
[2:38:15] <%Reverend_Roscoe> ZZ also hads some legit cool moments
[2:38:22] <stormhawk9891> YEYEYEYEYEYE TOSS THAT BITCH
[2:38:30] <+Tacotouchdown> it Eternal wind didnt even get to go off cut off
[2:38:33] <Shyakuuu> Beyond the Time PogChamp
[2:38:36] <+Jaysky> One of these days I'd like more Tiger & Bunny stuff
[2:38:36] <FreedomARX7> its cool
[2:38:45] <foiledyetagain> man i wish woolie would play this more than just the 1 off stream, cause when this game clicks, it fucking clicks
[2:38:56] <%Axle13j> gg
[2:38:56] <+Tacotouchdown> @jaysky s2
[2:39:06] <Shyakuuu> Poof
[2:39:07] <BlackermanZX> unmodded doodBait
[2:39:09] <@Menitta> GG
[2:39:11] <Hornssa> self destruct out of shame
[2:39:14] <@Menitta> Exia is so fucking fun
[2:39:15] <%Malik1002> suicide fuck it
[2:39:15] <DopeyDragon> Heero blowing up is in character
[2:39:20] <%Axle13j> LUL
[2:39:21] <+Jaysky> S2 would be nice, but I guess it had a movie?
[2:39:23] <+BlackMegaMan> How much love does G Gundam (aka the Fun One) gets in this game ?
[2:39:27] <%Reverend_Roscoe> 4 times!
[2:39:34] <biomegabear> ppretty boys with ptoblems. gundam wing
[2:39:39] <blackcloud288> A lot actually
[2:39:40] <dmstiles> If you cared about zeta, don't watch ZZ unless very drunk
[2:39:42] <+Jaysky> But considering how big My Hero has gotten T&B could do well
[2:39:43] <foiledyetagain> play nobel
[2:39:45] <townzzzzz> Herro blew himself up more than the enemy
[2:39:45] <foiledyetagain> Kappa
[2:39:49] <+Tacotouchdown> well the first time it was for the colony
[2:39:50] <+Jaysky> If actually marketed
[2:39:51] <FreedomARX7> Only happens twice
[2:39:54] <+MTLxSpider> the one with G-self?
[2:39:58] <DopeyDragon> Does this game have Doan in it?
[2:39:59] <+Tacotouchdown> but each time it got worse
[2:40:00] <+CreepGnome_> @BlackermanZX 5 suits i think?
[2:40:00] <Calamity2007> @BlackMegaMan Burning, Shining, Master, Dragon, Nobel, Rising, and Shadow
[2:40:00] <%Axle13j> @BlackMegaMan Its got Rising, Shining, Burning, Master, Noble, Shcwarze and Dragon in it
[2:40:04] <%DSD24> Here's Lupus
[2:40:07] <%subjectg> Man I wish G-Savior was in this game
[2:40:07] <blackcloud288> Nobel, Rising, SHining, Burning/God, Master, and Spiegel Gundam are in
[2:40:10] <+xGreenflame> ABABAB
[2:40:11] <alrobot2014> its not that often, but its weird that it happened more than once
[2:40:18] <Zouledge> @BlackMegaMan it has master gundam so do you need anything else Kappa ?
[2:40:20] <%Axle13j> Lupus PogChamp
[2:40:23] <+Tacotouchdown> someone play Lupus Rex
[2:40:23] <%Axle13j> TAIKOOOOO
[2:40:27] <@Menitta> yoooo

[2:40:32] <stormhawk9891> eeeeyup
[2:40:33] <%Reverend_Roscoe> git fukt
[2:40:33] <BlackermanZX> holy shit doodWAT
[2:40:35] <Ragnorok64> I love that when Treize had Heero test Epyon he specifically disabled the self destruct
[2:40:36] <Zouledge> that can go on for soo much longer
[2:40:38] <Vaxidd8> Love that IBO
[2:40:40] <Lucasleonava> Mika chill
[2:40:47] <arashi_icemaster> yeah Barbatos sucks to fight
[2:40:51] <+maenos2> man IBO goes some PLACES
[2:40:53] <+NekoNinja13> IBO is legit good
[2:40:53] <+BlackMegaMan> @Zouledge Does it also have the horse ?
[2:40:55] <Axonn1018> I hope someone gets Gusion grabbed tonight
[2:40:55] <@Menitta> "Yo Orga, you need me to murder? I'll fuckin murder." -Mika, probably
[2:40:59] <CrookedNoseArts> You did tap out early on IBO
[2:41:00] <dmstiles> Freaking iori orochinagi here
[2:41:05] <Vaxidd8> Oh man has Woolie not seen IBO?
[2:41:09] <stormhawk9891> @Axonn1018 They already did
[2:41:11] <+Jaysky> That VA sounded like Viral for a moment
[2:41:13] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @Menitta EXPLICITLY
[2:41:13] <DopeyDragon> Orga running memes sustain me
[2:41:13] <+Tacotouchdown> we had the Agnikakaieru will now it time for the lone Wolf King
[2:41:14] <%DSD24> Orga gets that cool suit too
[2:41:17] <+RealPT1> sunrise shows go wild in thier second seasons
[2:41:18] <Zouledge> @BlackMegaMan i dont remember but i know burning does, let me double check
[2:41:20] <shitthedd> I figured woolie would have been on board for IBO the whole run, it feels very him
[2:41:22] <+AirMaster> @Jaysky same seiyyu
[2:41:25] <blackcloud288> Woolie hasn't seen barely any Gundam yeah
[2:41:28] <spardanwarrior> @Vaxidd8 He bounced off it early on iirc
[2:41:32] <+Tacotouchdown> Orga gets a Awesome suit and never pilot it
[2:41:34] <%Axle13j> Barbatos is awesome
[2:41:34] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:41:36] <+Jaysky> Ahh, was too similar
[2:41:36] <Reizie_Etherealm> 止まるんじゃねぇぞ
[2:41:37] <Onamar> IBO sucks
[2:41:37] <Axonn1018> @stormhawk9891 Nice!
[2:41:39] <@Menitta> Woolie doesnt even know what a Gundam is
[2:41:40] <Twon_From_Wakanda> Woolie VS Gonna muder you Mika
[2:41:46] <KazMkII> I was Barbatos Lupus
[2:41:49] <dmstiles> Wait.._..damnit..maidenmasher. Mixing up my kof refs
[2:41:50] <%Axle13j> damn feelsbad
[2:41:52] <Vaxidd8> @spardanwarrior Damn shame absolutely love that show
[2:41:56] <GodGoshDarnIt> FINALLY
[2:41:58] <blackcloud288> Make a big room!
[2:41:59] <Zouledge> @BlackMegaMan he does have it
[2:42:01] <+Tacotouchdown> ibo good stake with the fat not trimmed off
[2:42:07] <%AlteisenReiseZ> dagnabbit
[2:42:08] <stormhawk9891> Awwwwww
[2:42:11] <+Kqha4000> @kazmkii Good stuff
[2:42:14] <redwarden76> would like to see woolie revisit this, it's much deeper than you'd think
[2:42:24] <+Tacotouchdown> rainbow dash
[2:42:26] <foiledyetagain> the current arcade game is EXVS2, technically this game is years out of date but is the latest console port
[2:42:28] <spardanwarrior> @Vaxidd8 Is it ok to watch it if you're a complete noob to Gundam?
[2:42:57] <+Jaysky> Aren't most Gundam's good to jump into so long as it isn't a direct sequel?
[2:43:00] <+Tacotouchdown> I play this once a week usually
[2:43:18] <Shyakuuu> Zeta boys
[2:43:21] <thespoforth> Just got here, how much have I missed?
[2:43:25] <blackcloud288> @spardanwarrior Yeah it is but it's not gonna win you over to GUndam thats for sure
[2:43:27] <+Tacotouchdown> @jaysky yes most are AU nowadays
[2:43:27] <%subjectg> @jaysky AU gundam series are cool to jump in, UC on the other hand is a commitment
[2:43:29] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @thebadpope all of it
[2:43:31] <FreedomARX7> AU shows yes, UC is best to watch in order
[2:43:35] <%Reverend_Roscoe> this is the last match
[2:43:37] <brunoberserk> EXTREME FATALITY ?
[2:43:38] <Axonn1018> Yo this remix
[2:43:41] <SirShabadoobie> most can be jumped into
[2:43:45] <Zouledge> @Jaysky some are better than other for jumping into the series imo
[2:43:47] <HelluvaNohbody> Kamelle is a mans name, AND I'M A MAN!
[2:43:48] <+megamanx74> what was the discord link?
[2:43:55] <%Malik1002> TIME TO SETTLE THIS SHIT
[2:43:57] <andre11dr> Finally someone picked Camil LUL
[2:44:01] <townzzzzz> which Z is best
[2:44:03] <%subjectg> SLAP HIS SHIT KAMILLE
[2:44:07] <%Malik1002> ZETA OVER DOUBLE
[2:44:12] <yodajr99> hey look theres a comet
[2:44:12] <neozz13> tjeres a bunch o uc that isnt required reading
[2:44:13] <+Tacotouchdown> zeta really good in this game
[2:44:18] <andre11dr> @townzzzzz Z for me
[2:44:20] <%Axle13j> Yeah, too many people assume its just an anime arena fighter with nothing NotLikeThis
[2:44:21] <%Wool> wait what song is this????
[2:44:23] <Reizie_Etherealm> Kibou no hana~
[2:44:23] <%Karkatstoaster> Kamille is a Transmasc icon Don’t @ Me TransgenderPride TransgenderPride TransgenderPride
[2:44:24] <+Jaysky> I haven't watched very many Gundam but always figured whenever there was a new series it meant a new universe
[2:44:24] <Blank9> does kamille still have his triple shots in this one?
[2:44:26] <%subjectg> just like how everyone slaps the shit out of you!
[2:44:29] <blackcloud288> Ay what song is playing?
[2:44:30] <GodGoshDarnIt> cool no Marida Cruz
[2:44:36] <Blank9> oh shit he does
[2:44:36] <Reizie_Etherealm> The song is from Iron blooded orphans
[2:44:41] <Twon_From_Wakanda> Oh God this song BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[2:44:43] <%Axle13j> also is this Freesia? T_T
[2:44:47] <reyntime180> Yes
[2:44:49] <townzzzzz> LUL
[2:44:51] <Reizie_Etherealm> Freesia
[2:44:54] <reyntime180> the meme song
[2:44:54] <Blank9> kamille is so good and straightforward to play in this compared to versus
[2:44:54] <%Axle13j> BibleThump
[2:44:54] <dmstiles> Surpass Amuro, surpass Char!
[2:45:00] <reyntime180> thats actually pretty good
[2:45:04] <+Jaysky> I mainly saw Gundam Seed + Destiny, and boy was Destiny a pile of shit.
[2:45:07] <huskarl_zap> PogChamp 1
[2:45:08] <%subjectg> Reminder that Jerid literally kickstarted the entire gryps war by dissing Kamille’s name
[2:45:09] <CrookedNoseArts> zap
[2:45:10] <neozz13> even Victory and F91 are far off uc that you can do those alone, theyre also actually good, unlike 90 percent of au gundams
[2:45:15] <%Axle13j> Zeta's design is so good
[2:45:19] <yodajr99> IBO was great
[2:45:28] <blackcloud288> Don't ever stop...
[2:45:29] <KeroKamina> @Jaysky you need to fix that and watch literally anythign else except Gundam Age
[2:45:32] <+Tacotouchdown> @jaysky Seed is just a soap opera while it preachs at you about morals
[2:45:32] <%subjectg> @axle13j i wish it was less blue though
[2:45:35] <andre11dr> Zeta is really good
[2:45:37] <+NekoNinja13> IBO was great!
[2:45:41] <Blank9> zeta is GREAT
[2:45:45] <brunoberserk> that is a big gun
[2:45:47] <reyntime180> Gundam AGE S2 was legit good
[2:45:49] <%Karkatstoaster> Remember: Kamille May have killed 3 of Jerids Girlfriends, but Jerid Killed Four
[2:45:50] <blackcloud288> IBO is trash
[2:45:51] <+Tacotouchdown> IBO Mendelssohn alot
[2:45:53] <Twon_From_Wakanda> Thats it woolie the song played no more
[2:45:54] <reyntime180> everything else in the trash
[2:45:54] <KazMkII> IBO was solid
[2:45:56] <Shyakuuu> Zeta's still my fave Gundam type design
[2:45:57] <time_axis> AGE is underrated, as long as you stop after S2
[2:46:01] <+Jaysky> I've considered IBO, and 00
[2:46:02] <redwarden76> zeta gundam is mid high tier
[2:46:02] <+Tacotouchdown> meddles*
[2:46:06] <%Axle13j> @subjectg It is kinda heavy on teh blue, but I really like blue so its all good lol
[2:46:11] <Artoo_The_Me> Just glue the ball joint. :)
[2:46:13] <blackcloud288> 00 is godtier, IBO is low tier
[2:46:14] <+RealPT1> put some floor wax on the joints to give them more hold
[2:46:15] <KazMkII> 00 is best gundam AU fight me
[2:46:19] <HelluvaNohbody> Everything is trash and we're trash
[2:46:20] <neozz13> @blackcloud288 jerid only had 2 girlfriends
[2:46:21] <Blank9> zeta is some of the best spammable keepaway
[2:46:21] <CrookedNoseArts> @Jaysky Gundam AGE is severely underrated imo
[2:46:23] <+Jaysky> Although from what I'm getting on here, IBO seems quite mixed
[2:46:30] <+MechaTheSpider> OH SHIT @WoolieVersus you're playing my fav game! RAD, have fun!
[2:46:31] <foiledyetagain> no puru stream FeelsBadMan
[2:46:35] <+Tacotouchdown> AGE toys but need work
[2:46:35] <+NekoNinja13> IBO is good dude stop hating @blackcloud288
[2:46:36] <dmstiles> So much to think on in zeta. Keeps getting better
[2:46:40] <+Tacotouchdown> try*
[2:46:41] <%Karkatstoaster> 00 is fine. I personally wasn’t able to get into it
[2:46:41] <OToole42> I liked IBO, not the best series, better than some
[2:46:48] <+RealPT1> floor polish technically
[2:46:52] <Zouledge> @Jaysky a lot of people had that as there first series, and yeah they arnt very good.
[2:46:53] <blackcloud288> @Jaysky I've seen EVERY one. 00 is top 2 for sure, IBO is somewhere in the middle
[2:46:56] <neozz13> no ibo is ass
[2:47:01] <%subjectg> @axle13j i feel it could use a similar paint job to the mk. II, which is why i like the white amuro version of the zeta the best
[2:47:05] <andre11dr> We haven't seen Thunderbolt at all huh
[2:47:06] <brunoberserk> GUNDAMO
[2:47:14] <FreedomARX7> Season 1 of IBO is fine
[2:47:15] <OToole42> Thunderbolt is rad
[2:47:17] <+Tygerpride> IBO is good but season 2 is shit
[2:47:18] <+CreepGnome_> 00 season 1 was good but s2 not so much
[2:47:18] <+cvp5127> build fighter is the best duh
[2:47:18] <+Tacotouchdown> Zeta 3 is awesome
[2:47:19] <+Jaysky> What besides 00 is near the top in your opinion @blackcloud288
[2:47:22] <Shyakuuu> IBO imo had big highs and big lows
[2:47:23] <+paladinstarbuster> KIDOU SENSHI GUNDAMUU
[2:47:23] <dmstiles> Liked IBO until the harem guy...
[2:47:26] <+Tacotouchdown> expensive too
[2:47:28] <+MTLxSpider> GUNDAMMUUU
[2:47:28] <+Tygerpride> FUCK IOK
[2:47:29] <snow_bush> GUNDAMU
[2:47:29] <%Karkatstoaster> I liked a lot of the concept but smth abt it really didn’t gel with me. It felt too real for Future Century style hype, and too supernatural for UC realism
[2:47:31] <+MechaTheSpider> Ya'll wrong, Turn A is the best
[2:47:33] <%Karkatstoaster> GUNDAMUUUU
[2:47:36] <@Menitta> I just didnt like Mika
[2:47:38] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Tygerpride
[2:47:42] <@Menitta> He had 0 agency
[2:47:45] <%Karkatstoaster> MOEAGARE GUNDAMU MOTHERFUCKER
[2:47:45] <huskarl_zap> Federation vs Zion is best game fight me.
[2:47:48] <time_axis> @dmstiles that was the point where I got bored and dropped it too
[2:47:51] <blackcloud288> @Jaysky Thunderbolt, G Gundam, 0079, 0080, 0083, 08th MS Team
[2:47:58] <CrookedNoseArts> I definitely agree with IBO ranking dead middle overall. It's a mixed bag
[2:47:59] <Shyakuuu> Its good overall but inconsistent
[2:48:01] <+Tacotouchdown> Everyone accepts Turn A as good
[2:48:02] <+MechaTheSpider> Zeonic Front @huskarl_zap
[2:48:10] <blackcloud288> @Jaysky But you gotta see 0079 to understand the UC OVAs. It's complicated
[2:48:25] <neozz13> woah hold on 00 is also straight ass
[2:48:25] <townzzzzz> never stop boosting
[2:48:25] <biomegabear> X is good, we don't get a lot of post wars series
[2:48:26] <%Karkatstoaster> My only problem with Turn A is the timeline BS
[2:48:29] <huskarl_zap> @mechathespider never played it
[2:48:32] <@Menitta> 0079 is the only one Ive seen to completion lol
[2:48:34] <%subjectg> Knowledge of ZZ is practically required for Unicorn
[2:48:34] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:48:39] <+Tacotouchdown> IBO wastes Episodes on stuff that should have not been seen
[2:48:39] <+MTLxSpider> so shoot > boost melee > sidestep
[2:48:43] <%Axle13j> !MOTIVATED
[2:48:43] <@Moobot> 1665 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[2:48:44] <time_axis> You can just pretend Turn A is an AU with the other series as a backstory
[2:48:46] <+MechaTheSpider> @huskarl_zap that's why. It's a better Rainbow Six, play it ASAP
[2:48:52] <@Menitta> Unicorn is good right?
[2:48:56] <%Karkatstoaster> I really don’t like the idea of Future Century and UC existing in the same world
[2:48:56] <+MTLxSpider> yes
[2:48:58] <%Axle13j> PEW PEW
[2:49:02] <+MTLxSpider> unicorn is solid
[2:49:02] <Twon_From_Wakanda> yea
[2:49:05] <Blank9> they never got to see specials
[2:49:06] <neozz13> @Menitta no
[2:49:08] <%Karkatstoaster> @time_axis that’s not how backstories world
[2:49:08] <+Tacotouchdown> unicorn is good
[2:49:10] <%Axle13j> Squaaad
[2:49:11] <KeroKamina> @Menitta unicorn is good yes
[2:49:14] <@Menitta> the duality of man
[2:49:14] <%Karkatstoaster> Work
[2:49:15] <stormhawk9891> @Menitta Full of Newtype BS but really good
[2:49:16] <Spirit_NB> Even GM Head got in
[2:49:19] <%Livelinne> Gundom
[2:49:19] <%Malik1002> the squad
[2:49:26] <%Livelinne> woolieSHOOK woolieSHOOK woolieSHOOK
[2:49:27] <+CreepGnome_> i watched unicorn but don't remember any of it aside from the suits
[2:49:28] <Shyakuuu> Yeah i cant stand the unified timeline theory with Turn A ill never accept it
[2:49:29] <dmstiles> Can we just a zeta remake with thunderbolt's animation? Please???
[2:49:30] <%subjectg> Unicorn is good but near impenetrable without UC knowledge
[2:49:36] <+Tacotouchdown> unicorn in a nut shell "the possibility"
[2:49:39] <%Karkatstoaster> Unicorn is great
[2:49:41] <redwarden76> unicorn is a mediocre super robot show, that's my hot take
[2:49:42] <FreedomARX7> it is lol
[2:49:46] <andre11dr> People shit on Zeta because of the stupid shit some of the caracters do to get some pussy, but it's still one of my favorites
[2:49:47] <OToole42> 08th ms team, aka Gund-Nam
[2:49:52] <CrookedNoseArts> Unicorn is very good but it has a lot of required viewing to appreciate the call backs to old story threads
[2:49:54] <%Karkatstoaster> @redwarden76 you’re wrong but ok
[2:49:55] <+MechaTheSpider> Turn A is just far, far future of UC with REFERENCES to other shows, rather than being connected 100%
[2:49:55] <Zouledge> @subjectg agree a lot of UC is like that
[2:49:57] <foiledyetagain> unicorn ost is sick tbh
[2:49:59] <+xerotwo> doodLUL
[2:50:00] <BlackermanZX> LUL
[2:50:05] <%Karkatstoaster> The beast of possibility motherfucker
[2:50:12] <+Jaysky> @Jaysky Looking them up Thunderbolt seems interesting, G I've not seen enough of. May dip my toes in 00 and Thunderbolt later tonight.
[2:50:13] <%Axle13j> @OToole42 That's the best way i've seen it put LUL
[2:50:17] <blackcloud288> @andre11dr Thats the point and what MAKES it good though. It's a Freudian character study
[2:50:22] <+cyankh_r> I watched Unicorn without any other UC context and idk man
[2:50:23] <CrookedNoseArts> Thank you for playing this, Woolie!
[2:50:25] <shitthedd> doozy bots is post correct century
[2:50:27] <neozz13> unicorn is terrible. literally changed the concept of newtypes and the writer wanted to make somethig cooler than the axis shock
[2:50:27] <+MechaTheSpider> SIEG ZEON
[2:50:36] <+ElectricFoxLex> When's the SamSho runback
[2:50:41] <Shyakuuu> Just._.keep them AU's. Its easier
[2:50:45] <+henshin_a_nogo> thanks for exposing more peeps to Gundam, this game deserves all the love it can get
[2:50:46] <%subjectg> @shitthedd never forget doozy bots, and guntank wheelchair
[2:50:48] <+Tacotouchdown> 08th full metal gundam
[2:51:02] <%Karkatstoaster> Although I will admit, it kinda sucks that the later stuff after Unicorn ruined the whole “human peace is possible thing”
[2:51:04] <Twon_From_Wakanda> Say what you will about Gundam Seed Destiny. But the op Wings of Worlds is Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[2:51:05] <brunoberserk> char did nothing wrong
[2:51:10] <Burningjaso> I would like access to said discord trying to find people to play with
[2:51:11] <blackcloud288> @Jaysky Coo coo, Thunderbolt's sick as Woolies saying now
[2:51:11] <andre11dr> YOU NEVER FUCKING PICKED IT
[2:51:12] <%Reverend_Roscoe> Hard disagree
[2:51:13] <%Karkatstoaster> Unicorn is great as a capstone to UC
[2:51:13] <@Menitta> I fucking love this game. So glad yall played it
[2:51:16] <redwarden76> unicorns best quality is showing off a lot of cool grunt designs
[2:51:18] <+MechaTheSpider> WATCH TURN A AND X
[2:51:24] <%Reverend_Roscoe> TB is not the BEST, but it is alright
[2:51:28] <%Karkatstoaster> Thunderbolt December Sky is okay but Bandit Flower fucking sucks
[2:51:32] <huskarl_zap> Gouf is good
[2:51:32] <CookieCutter007> !uptime
[2:51:32] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 51 minutes
[2:51:33] <time_axis> first episode of thunderbolt is good, but it overstays its welcome imo
[2:51:37] <Zouledge> @Twon_From_Wakanda i hate seed and destiny with an unholy passion but i have to agree doodStare
[2:51:40] <stormhawk9891> @redwarden76 God the jegans are so good
[2:51:44] <%Reverend_Roscoe> The show is only ok
[2:51:44] <%Karkatstoaster> Bandit flower is terrible
[2:51:45] <andre11dr> But Psycho Zaku
[2:51:46] <+Tacotouchdown> Thunderbolt is aesthetic the show
[2:51:53] <redwarden76> jegans and rezels are godly
[2:51:54] <%reknownblackcat> @WoolieVersus Moonmoon scored 53 million in a single combo in THPS
[2:51:55] <dmstiles> Unicorn starts well and has awesome fights, but messes up later on
[2:51:55] <Shyakuuu> To be fair its mostly peaceful inbetween f91 and victory
[2:51:58] <%Karkatstoaster> Full Armor is so fucking cool
[2:52:00] <%subjectg> @redwarden76 lot of the best grunt designs are in unicorn, rezel, jegan ecoas, jesta, anksha, like damn
[2:52:07] <SpaceGuntank> the suit is not called thunderbolt its called "Full Armor Gundam"
[2:52:21] <CrookedNoseArts> Bandit flower is great! Atlas has a rail gun.
[2:52:25] <Blank9> unfortunate name
[2:52:31] <redwarden76> @ subjectg the delta plus and the jesta are so rad
[2:52:35] <+CreepGnome_> airmaster was a cool gundam
[2:52:37] <blackcloud288> Yeah the F AG is a cool suit
[2:52:37] <stormhawk9891> @redwarden76 Jesta I mean
[2:52:39] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> is Gundam on steam or is it just ps4?
[2:52:41] <%Reverend_Roscoe> Psycho Zaku and Full Armor Gundam don't really fit with anything seen in the OYW though
[2:52:44] <neozz13> 00 and unicorn are so plagued with the writers wanting to make cool moments and the strongest suits, theyre dogshit
[2:52:51] <dmstiles> Jegans are really cool
[2:52:51] <%subjectg> @redwarden76 how could i forget the delta plus, silver bullet too
[2:52:54] <Shyakuuu> FA Gundam is sinister AF i love it
[2:53:03] <redwarden76> 00 really shits the bed on the second season
[2:53:04] <stormhawk9891> @redwarden76 Jegans are still cool tho
[2:53:23] <+Tacotouchdown> 00 2nd season is fine
[2:53:26] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> LUL Reminds me of a friend of mine who accidentally leaves stuff at my place
[2:53:27] <Reizie_Etherealm> Thanks for the stream Woolie!
[2:53:31] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @stormhawk9891 Jegans are awesome
[2:53:33] <andre11dr> FA Gundam is just so fucking built for killing, i love it
[2:53:35] <%Axle13j> Thanks Airmaster!
[2:53:37] <stormhawk9891> @subjectg Yo the Silver Bullet Suppressor is rad as shit
[2:53:38] <foiledyetagain> @WoolieVersus mandela gundam is actually in the game, but its an assist for nobel
[2:53:41] <Shyakuuu> Need more evil hero gundams like that and Tristan
[2:53:42] <Blank9> 00 is the series of the best pilot names
[2:53:44] <arashi_icemaster> jegans are the best grunt suit
[2:53:49] <Blank9> the best, dumbest names ever
[2:53:54] <redwarden76> jegan is great but gmiii > jegan
[2:53:56] <%wardogleader15> Bowing out now, have fun on your second game!
[2:53:57] <dmstiles> ReZel, mass produced zeta=Autocool
[2:54:02] <%subjectg> @stormhawk9891 i like the og silver bullet the best but i appreciate thicc legs
[2:54:09] <+xerotwo> BIMMY AND JIMMY
[2:54:10] <Twon_From_Wakanda> @Blank9 keep that up and ill buy u dinner
[2:54:11] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> Waiter, refill the sippycups BabyRage

[2:54:20] <%RyTYoung> PogChamp
[2:54:21] <townzzzzz> awww shit

[2:54:28] <+Tacotouchdown> GUNDAMU
[2:54:29] <alrobot2014> is that a dmc menu sound i hear
[2:54:31] <+AirMaster> no prob
[2:54:36] <stormhawk9891> @subjectg I mainly love how it needs to carry around spare arms just to shoot its gun
[2:54:37] <Reizie_Etherealm> Wait it's not the end of the stream? I thought that was it
[2:54:41] <%Reverend_Roscoe> That is @alrobot2014
[2:54:42] <+Tacotouchdown> KIIIIDO SENSHI
[2:54:47] <andre11dr> Chat,Full Armour Gundam, or Gundam Atlas?Pick wisely
[2:54:48] <DXLelouch24> That was a DMC sound
[2:54:52] <+flipsilog> wait.. did the stream just ended???
[2:54:53] <%Reverend_Roscoe> JESUS VOLUME
[2:54:57] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @flipsilog no
[2:54:59] <%Reverend_Roscoe> break
[2:54:59] <neozz13> @andre11dr atlas
[2:55:01] <SpaceGuntank> Gundamu Time is over, so i'mma dip. thanks for the match and GG to whoever was my ally LUL
[2:55:04] <Lichzim> @dx\nah its on a BRB
[2:55:04] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> dan, that gundam game isn't on Steam
[2:55:05] <Reizie_Etherealm> I said thanks for nothing, darn
[2:55:05] <Twon_From_Wakanda> Here comes the persona
[2:55:06] <+flipsilog> ahh okay
[2:55:08] <blackcloud288> Atlas is cooler I think, but only has 1 fight as cool as the FUllArmor
[2:55:13] <+NekoNinja13> Atlas easy @andre11dr
[2:55:16] <dmstiles> Atlas cause whaaaaaa?
[2:55:16] <@Menitta> SourPls
[2:55:24] <+akira_chong> Game looks fun. Reminds me a bit of Custom Robo.
[2:55:32] <+Tacotouchdown> atlas is waaay to modern looking for 0079
[2:55:35] <Shyakuuu> I like Atlas' design tbh but FA gundam is more scary
[2:55:36] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:55:41] <%subjectg> @stormhawk9891 i always thought it was horrifically impractical but i guess they’ll do anything to hear that succulent beam magnum sound. Prototype suits, not even once
[2:55:52] <+akira_chong> Speaking of which, does anybody REMEMBER Custom Robo?
[2:55:58] <Shyakuuu> But Atlas is unique
[2:56:09] <stormhawk9891> @subjectg Impractical as hell but sooooo cool tho
[2:56:15] <redwarden76> thinking back custom robo was my introduction to mecha
[2:56:19] <+Tacotouchdown> new type monks and cult
[2:56:24] <%MonsieurHonHon> Damn I totally missed that today was GIFG
[2:56:28] <XxBigNerdxX> are they on break or are they donezo
[2:56:34] <dmstiles> That 1st person versus against the thunderbolt full armor though
[2:56:37] <+akira_chong> Break
[2:56:49] <andre11dr> I just love the 4 shields ,it looks so ridiculous
[2:56:58] <XxBigNerdxX> fasho are they still gonna fight people or what's happening
[2:57:01] <Shyakuuu> Way i see it Atlas is like the GP Gundams, ahead of their time suppressed tech
[2:57:05] <+Tacotouchdown> the 4 shield is awesome
[2:57:09] <blue2red> HahaLean
[2:57:30] <+Tacotouchdown> I like the theme of the FA gundam it fits the chaos of fighting
[2:57:30] <%subjectg> @stormhawk9891 if i wanted myself an impractical suit, i’d probably grab myself a byarlant honestly
[2:57:34] <dmstiles> Full armor=Fear itself
[2:57:42] <redwarden76> apparently thunderbolt is alt-UC but gundam has never really cared too much about canonicity
[2:57:43] <andre11dr> The POV of that grunt is just so fucked up
[2:57:51] <zashzila> Im glad the boys played mbon
[2:58:11] <+flipsilog> Woolie really needs to try Mobile Suit Gundam Battle Operations 2
[2:58:11] <+Tacotouchdown> anything animated was the line for cannon in Gundam
[2:58:11] <%subjectg> Yeah but that stark jegan pilot showed her who wore the pants round those parts
[2:58:14] <dmstiles> Byarlant custom not the reg
[2:58:23] <stormhawk9891> @redwarden76 I was just about to mention the Byarlant, I love me some impractical suits
[2:58:27] <%subjectg> if it weren’t for newtype bs he would’ve taken that
[2:58:28] <Shyakuuu> Psycho Zaku is pretty scary too theyre both dope
[2:58:35] <+Tacotouchdown> Yo i want a Virgo 2 as my impractical suit
[2:58:48] <stormhawk9891> @redwarden76 It's why my favorite mech in anything is the Alt Eisen from SRW
[2:59:11] <andre11dr> Psycho Zaku is ridiculous in that you need to sacrifice all of your limbs to pilot it
[2:59:12] <dmstiles> Gabthley all the way for me though. Great at every range
[2:59:18] <lennonbad> yeyeye
[2:59:20] <%RyTYoung> yes

[3:00:31] <Shyakuuu> Thats what makes psycho zaku scary its fueled by sheer zeon zealotness , there are no good guys in thunderbolt
[3:00:31] <dmstiles> Would need a repaint though..weird brown?
[3:00:33] <neozz13> Hammrabi is cool, tho i might be blinded because of yzan

[3:08:09] <RyuuAoi> Reggi needs Spark Notes
[3:08:26] <bazz_tv> this game isn't canon btw, they couldn't get the lisence for some reason
[3:08:32] <%RyTYoung> wow
[3:08:38] <@Menitta> This really looks good
[3:08:42] <deafmelone> Jimmy doesnt want to work with Billy anymore
[3:08:44] <RyuuAoi> Reggie is Jim Kelly

[3:09:05] <Klefth> Character design + time = the shit
[3:09:06] <SpookyBeef7> There's, like, a billion different Double Dragon canons. It's fucking nuts.
[3:09:06] <%mighty_max_t> That's a cool timeover gimmick!
[3:09:06] <+Rabbitmage> Then how come Marian is back in Double Dragon 4 and they're bros
[3:09:14] <stormhawk9891> @WoolieVersus Pick canon teams for the tag supers
[3:09:18] <+cvp5127> hot
[3:09:20] <Bustahhwulf> billy is just rock lmao
[3:09:23] <bazz_tv> which in retroespective is kinda weird considering back in the day everyone could get the lisence
[3:09:27] <%RyTYoung> sick af
[3:09:34] <deafmelone> RED BLAZE
[3:09:43] <Hideow> This game gives some Garou vibes
[3:09:45] <lennonbad> Billy's trying...
[3:09:45] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:09:49] <ShinobiPhoenix> was anyone else excited about the Prince of Persia remake UNTIL they saw "Epic Game Store" on the bottom for available Platforms?
[3:09:54] <Storm_Samurai> god damn this is neo geo as shit
[3:09:55] <MyNameIsRasus> red braAaze
[3:09:57] <%SirGO0SE> this looks great
[3:10:05] <+Rabbitmage> prince of persia remake looks visually bad
[3:10:05] <andre11dr> I always thought he was saying Red Rage
[3:10:12] <bazz_tv> @superbro64 they basically just kept the names but ommitted the Lee surname
[3:10:18] <townzzzzz> WALLS
[3:10:18] <+cvp5127> pop remake looks like a ps3 game
[3:10:19] <Hideow> And that's iori LUL
[3:10:24] <KnivesEve> Bimmy!
[3:10:45] <OToole42> thats a king kick
[3:10:53] <Storm_Samurai> yo this was primarily designed by a mexican team? mad props
[3:10:57] <%Superbro64> @bazz_tv so this is essentially the k999 situation then, more or less
[3:10:58] <ShinobiPhoenix> I don't mind the visuals (too much), but that Epic Store logo killed me buying it for PC immediately
[3:11:06] <%Superbro64> it _is_ snk playmore, or at least playmore
[3:11:15] <+xerotwo> IZUNA DROP
[3:11:19] <Reizie_Etherealm> IZUNA DROP
[3:11:22] <%Reverend_Roscoe> SPECIAL SANKS
[3:11:22] <dmstiles> Rock howard x gato?
[3:11:37] <%Reverend_Roscoe> THE FILM CREDITS SAY SPECIAL SANKS
[3:11:44] <bazz_tv> so yeah not quite Bimmy and Jammy, but certainly the best looking version of the Lee bros, even if they aren't canon
[3:11:51] <%Solidnick18> alright

[3:12:33] <%Superbro64> pupa is the best character animation wise, learned her from the mugen days
[3:12:42] <+akira_chong> In all seriousness though these character designs are FIRE
[3:12:46] <hoppenflop> reppuken
[3:12:48] <andre11dr> Oh look, it's Iori
[3:12:53] <dunkle321> Mrs Iori over here
[3:12:58] <brunoberserk> yeah , pupa is from brazil
[3:13:00] <+xerotwo> REPPUKEN
[3:13:04] <RyuuAoi> She just did one too many shrooms.
[3:13:22] <+SvenHolgersson> YO HOLD ON WRENCH GIRL
[3:13:24] <+SvenHolgersson> I'M SOL
[3:13:25] <+SvenHolgersson> D
[3:13:26] <dmstiles> Orochi chris in doubledragonland
[3:13:35] <%Totally_Not_Toby> miror b you got this
[3:13:42] <bazz_tv> also another fun fact, half of the game was made on México, concept art and character design was in Mexico, but engine and tecnical stuff was made in japan
[3:13:47] <RyuuAoi> Punish
[3:13:53] <Klefth> So sick
[3:14:10] <Pt_Kamen> What about Matimelee with Rage of the Dragons secret characters?
[3:14:46] <townzzzzz> super are either qcf, hcb+f , qcb hcf
[3:14:52] <dmstiles> Is the mexican team still around?
[3:14:59] <bazz_tv> the team behind Matrimelee and the Power Instinct series owns this game
[3:15:25] <+akira_chong> @bazz_tv The guys in Mexico knocked the art out of the park
[3:15:38] <%Superbro64> am I crazy or was a power instinct sequel announced?
[3:15:41] <andre11dr> This dude has some wild ass shoes
[3:15:48] <bazz_tv> @dmstiles nah, they just worked on this and a couple of arcade games before going bankrup
[3:15:55] <%Superbro64> I could of sworn some old classic fg dev teased a new game in the works
[3:15:57] <+SvenHolgersson> This Oni dude looks rad
[3:16:04] <%Superbro64> from neo geo era. I forget
[3:16:10] <Onamar> That was straight up a buster worlf
[3:16:16] <bazz_tv> I think their last game was a soccer game
[3:16:31] <BlackermanZX> was that just a terry move
[3:16:43] <dmstiles> a shame. Good pixel art is hard to come by
[3:16:46] <+SvenHolgersson> GOTTIE
[3:16:46] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:16:48] <hoppenflop> oh niiiice
[3:16:49] <townzzzzz> yooooooo
[3:16:53] <Reizie_Etherealm> God damn
[3:16:53] <+shivvey> Yooo and the slide after
[3:17:06] <Reizie_Etherealm> That was sick
[3:17:24] <bazz_tv> their name was Evoga if I remember correctly
[3:18:02] <stormhawk9891> @WoolieVersus You gonna show off the tag supers with canon teams?
[3:18:12] <@Menitta> Are they using Fightcade 2
[3:18:17] <%Superbro64> @bazz_tv you're correct, their name is listed on the bottom of the title screen of this game
[3:18:23] <+akira_chong> Yes. Her "style." That's some really big style~
[3:18:34] <%Superbro64> "playmore" is too, which is weird, because it isnt "snk playmore"
[3:18:35] <TigerClaws12> HE BEEN LABBIN
[3:18:36] <gasperbpuffn> 2 shadows playing fighting games lul
[3:18:42] <%Superbro64> maybe playmore aquired snk in 2005-ish?
[3:18:45] <@Menitta> "He's just pressin buttons"
[3:18:49] <%Superbro64> this is copyright 2002
[3:19:06] <Kain5707> lights out stream HahaSleep
[3:19:21] <bazz_tv> maybe, this was one of those weird Neo geo but no snk titles
[3:19:54] <+scrumbotime> He has Fully Defined Cheeks
[3:20:03] <OToole42> Radel has a booty on him
[3:20:08] <falconx9k> "It feels like I'm wearing nothing at all." -Radel
[3:20:15] <townzzzzz> suit so tight
[3:20:17] <bazz_tv> I think outside of KOF the only other oficial snk games getting released on Neo geo was Sengoku 3
[3:20:17] <%Superbro64> @scrumbotime secret MGS 3 character Kappa
[3:20:18] <BlackermanZX> radel looks like kof yashiro a little bit
[3:20:23] <spardanwarrior> Looks like Maxima minus the suit
[3:20:42] <bazz_tv> around that timeftame i mean
[3:20:46] <+xerotwo> WALK WITH ELIAS
[3:20:53] <bazz_tv> time frame*
[3:20:56] <dmstiles> Urien before becoming a nudist
[3:20:56] <andre11dr> I think Playmore acquired SNK in 2003 ,because that's when they where going bankrupt
[3:21:35] <Punnyshment> did you use Red rage yet
[3:21:50] <RyuuAoi> Kirby x DDD Vibes
[3:21:52] <%Superbro64> I think SNK was going bankrupt around the end of the NESTS saga, and I know KOF 12 / 13 killed SNK / Playmore
[3:22:09] <HelluvaNohbody> SNK goes bankrupt every tuesday
[3:22:14] <andre11dr> Iea that would be 2003
[3:22:18] <%Superbro64> until they were aquired by chinese investors sometime in the 2010 decade?
[3:22:21] <%Superbro64> I forget
[3:22:35] <andre11dr> 2002 was the end of NESTS
[3:22:37] <+JingKaisean> damn dude, has woolie been streaming all day?
[3:22:52] <bazz_tv> The chinese buy out was more of a recent thing i think
[3:22:56] <RyuuAoi> @superbro64 Everybody makes mistakes! But not as many as Pat...
[3:23:12] <andre11dr> I think the China buy out was like around 2014
[3:23:17] <+SvenHolgersson> Pupa is such a babe
[3:23:18] <%Superbro64> Remember to buy SNK games so they can stop going bankrupt pumping out 50 million fighting games every year Kappa
[3:23:19] <Hornssa> stupid sexy pepe

[3:27:25] <Virgil_Valentine> Damn woolie, we drop in and you looking at topless anime dudes???

[3:28:10] <%komradedog> woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO
[3:28:14] <bazz_tv> too slow Reggie
[3:28:23] <RyuuAoi> @tuesti Chat will never die
[3:28:26] <%Superbro64> The character designer had a particular...taste when making these characters, huh Kappa
[3:28:36] <+BlackMegaMan> This (along with a lot games on the mvs hardware) is one of those games I would have never heard of if not for emulation
[3:28:38] <%Superbro64> I'm seeing a theme here sajamSegue3
[3:28:38] <dmstiles> Looks like cassandra watched fifth element recently
[3:28:40] <bazz_tv> you need to get dat mexican kof player speed
[3:29:05] <+paladinstarbuster> raging storm
[3:29:26] <+xerotwo> CASSANDRA Kreygasm
[3:29:27] <Mvrdok_> Company name is Piko Interactive for those interested
[3:29:28] <bazz_tv> what a trade
[3:29:28] <%heartlesshealer> chipped out
[3:29:34] <+SvenHolgersson> NOTHING PERSONEL REGGIE
[3:29:40] <+paladinstarbuster> cheesed
[3:29:41] <$g0g3t4> Theres also a jump version of the C+D with a different button sequence for everyone
[3:29:43] <taquito_blade> Cassandras outfit reminds me Lilu from the Fifth element
[3:29:54] <andre11dr> No invincibility, this is truly a Mexican flavored Fighting Game
[3:30:06] <%Solidnick18> more pupa
[3:30:12] <brunoberserk> pupa is brazilian
[3:30:23] <Kain5707> Pepe FeelsGoodMan
[3:30:25] <RyuuAoi> Use ab guy
[3:30:43] <%gambit_gamble> Pepe be vibing
[3:30:57] <bazz_tv> are they gonna use Fightcade 2 itself for online matches or they gonna go parsec?
[3:30:57] <andre11dr> Capoeira is totally Mexican you guys Kappa
[3:30:57] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1303234770881699840?s=19
[3:31:00] <%Tearonex> I forgot the guy's name is fucking Pepe
[3:31:08] <%Tearonex> wow that name is ruined in my head
[3:31:22] <%komradedog> man, these heavy kicks these characters have are a trip, especially radel's
[3:31:34] <RyuuAoi> Pepe La Pew
[3:31:35] <%Superbro64> C+D universal mechanic is a neat way of incorporating auto combos into your game
[3:31:42] <bazz_tv> Pepe is Mexican Kim Kapwhan basically
[3:31:45] <%heartlesshealer> wrench fireball
[3:31:46] <+BlackMegaMan> Since we're here doing these MVS deep cuts I can't be the only one waiting for the eventual Matrimelee stream
[3:32:11] <dmstiles> Is Pepe crow from yatagarasu?
[3:32:12] <Mvrdok_> Yeah, I don't see this one coming back anytime soon
[3:32:15] <Hornssa> try air C+D
[3:32:30] <+Navekraith> Sound like Alice is saying : Talk to the Hand!
[3:32:34] <Sol_Install> holy shit
[3:32:37] <townzzzzz> LUL
[3:32:37] <%Superbro64> wryy
[3:32:43] <$g0g3t4> gotta land C+D then hold up to start the alternate button sequence
[3:32:46] <%DSD24> Alice with the Jedah laugh
[3:32:50] <+Joe2187> yall on parsec?
[3:32:56] <@Menitta> Man I really wanna try this
[3:32:58] <townzzzzz> FC2
[3:33:28] <%Josef_Stryker> So is this an SNK game?
[3:33:28] <Sol_Install> I hope this comes back one day
[3:33:30] <%Malik1002> alllllrrriiiiiggggghhhhhhhtttttt
[3:33:33] <%Malik1002> i think
[3:33:40] <brunoberserk> REBLAZE
[3:33:41] <bazz_tv> Sonia is very King like, KOF king I mean
[3:33:42] <%Malik1002> i am going to hi the old bed sama
[3:33:49] <%Superbro64> Oni looks like alternate universe OPM Garou
[3:33:53] <%Superbro64> it's funny
[3:33:53] <heroicspiritavenger> Are Billy and Jimmy the only Double Dragon references in this game?
[3:34:05] <+JingKaisean> sonia rockin karen colors
[3:34:09] <+BlackMegaMan> These character designs just scream late 90s/early 00s
[3:34:11] <RyuuAoi> @malik1002 Sleep with Woolie!
[3:34:20] <+vaporousTippler> The sub-boss in arcade mode is from Double Dragon.
[3:34:27] <deafmelone> Abobo or Abubo is in this game
[3:34:27] <taquito_blade> oh shit i just realized this is double dragons
[3:34:28] <bazz_tv> Oni is younger Yamazaki but with cosolay clothes
[3:34:41] <brunoberserk> @heroicspiritavenger abobo is in the game too
[3:34:50] <%DSD24> This game looks fun
[3:35:30] <yusefHD> any grappling Bois?
[3:35:38] <Hornssa> some of the character designs are like falcoon but sensible
[3:35:50] <bazz_tv> who owns the double dragon ip currently anyway?
[3:35:52] <heroicspiritavenger> I know this is technically a legally distinct game but is this a pseudo-homage to the Double Dragon movie?
[3:35:53] <@Menitta> man I miss Fightcade 1
[3:36:02] <%DSD24> Cassandra has a cute design
[3:36:19] <brunoberserk> yeah
[3:36:28] <RyuuAoi> Woolie, cosplay Jimmy...and Black Goku.
[3:36:34] <@Menitta> Cant get the game running BibleThump
[3:36:34] <Mvrdok_> @bazz_tv Piko Interactive. Don't expect much I guess
[3:36:46] <%DSD24> Damn Elias with the Cross Tattoo on his back
[3:36:46] <RyuuAoi> GET IN BOIS
[3:36:49] <andre11dr> Welcome to church motherfucker
[3:36:53] <heroicspiritavenger> @menitta did you download all the BIOS?
[3:37:08] <+DrToiletPaper> Jimmy's design really reminds me of another character, and I'm not sure who
[3:37:09] <Hornssa> elias is kimo
[3:37:09] <bazz_tv> you can still use Fightcade 1, @menitta fightcade 2 has a legacy mode, and it even comes with the old version
[3:37:09] <+BlackMegaMan> seeing this takes me back to just finding out about kawaks
[3:37:15] <@Menitta> I'm trying to do that
[3:37:22] <lem______> they arent doing parsec?
[3:37:26] <+Joe2187> is there a share link to join on parsec?
[3:37:56] <+akira_chong> No, they're gonna do Fightcade
[3:38:27] <bazz_tv> it make sense FC2 netcode is pretty good
[3:38:27] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:38:32] <+xerotwo> SHINING
[3:38:33] <townzzzzz> SLAP
[3:38:34] <+xerotwo> doodLUL
[3:38:43] <%DSD24> She's getting Hype
[3:38:48] <RyuuAoi> Scrubs! I don't want no scrubs!
[3:38:53] <+Joe2187> This game looks clean AF
[3:39:06] <andre11dr> parsec is for games with bad online, Fighcade has rollback
[3:39:07] <+nechallenger> YATTA YATTA YATTA YATTA
[3:39:10] <+Joe2187> When did this game come out?
[3:39:10] <%Solidnick18> what
[3:39:22] <%Solidnick18> oh ok
[3:39:34] <%Superbro64> @Joe2187 2002
[3:39:40] <RyuuAoi> Pupa looks very unapproachable
[3:39:44] <bazz_tv> getting oddly specific there Reggie
[3:39:44] <%Superbro64> this twitch reply feature is neato
[3:39:46] <+Joe2187> is this SNK?
[3:39:56] <%DSD24> I disagree she seems pretty fun to be around
[3:40:15] <%Superbro64> @Joe2187 evoga, playmore
[3:40:23] <andre11dr> No ,but it's made by Mexicans ,so kinda
[3:40:27] <+GuavaLava11> @joe2187 Looks Arcsys
[3:40:28] <bazz_tv> @joe2187 no, is on neo geo but is by Evoga
[3:40:53] <+BlackMegaMan> Is Pupa supposed to be a gear head ?
[3:40:53] <+Joe2187> This looks pretty fucking sick
[3:41:02] <+GuavaLava11> Really? Looks like an arcsys game based on the sound effects and movement
[3:41:17] <RyuuAoi> I'll talk to Pepe doe KappaPride
[3:41:20] <%Superbro64> neo geo seemed liked a neat console that completely went under my radar. I wonder what it was like to get games for the system
[3:41:27] <TigerClaws12> the SNK special
[3:41:29] <+Joe2187> Pepe is Kim
[3:41:30] <%DSD24> I like Pepe
[3:41:35] <%Superbro64> unless I'm dumb and the neo geo was an arcard board or something
[3:41:36] <@Menitta> I would fucking love to own a Neo Geo
[3:41:38] <+paladinstarbuster> les go reggie
[3:41:51] <+Dova573> waiting
[3:41:59] <+akira_chong> @Joe2187 It's made by a combination of a Japanese dev and a Mexican one, using the Neo Geo
[3:42:02] <@akuda_bar> i love this goofy arcade mood
[3:42:03] <Hornssa> it went under the radar of everyone that didn't have $700 for the AES and $250 per game
[3:42:13] <%Superbro64> jesus h christ
[3:42:26] <RyuuAoi> Open the floodgates of fisticuffs! Let it burn! Let it burn!
[3:42:34] <+Joe2187> is there a new fightcade release?
[3:42:36] <raikagelord1> Woolie played the Rumble Fish again yet?
[3:42:37] <+Dova573> Do we just challenge then>
[3:42:42] <+xerotwo> PogChamp
[3:42:45] <Hornssa> oh shit abobo
[3:42:46] <townzzzzz> oh geez
[3:42:50] <Hornssa> or abubu
[3:43:03] <%Superbro64> is the top " player vs player" ui a fightcade 2 thing?
[3:43:08] <bazz_tv> the AES was both a cabinet and a console i think
[3:43:14] <%Superbro64> I don't think og fightcade does that
[3:43:26] <RyuuAoi> Cheat codes?!
[3:43:32] <andre11dr> The neo geo was really expensive, and had cartiges of the size of a tombstones @superbro64
[3:43:35] <bazz_tv> yeah is FC2 only
[3:43:38] <RyuuAoi> We in!
[3:43:40] <@Menitta> I need to put time to download the full romset at some point
[3:43:48] <pavramz> no fc1 onlybhas yournname
[3:43:49] <bazz_tv> it counts wins too for some games
[3:44:04] <HelluvaNohbody> AES was the console MVS was the cab, maybe the other way around
[3:44:05] <RyuuAoi> Aspersio! Aspersio!
[3:44:09] <@Menitta> 3rd Strike works no problem but now this for me
[3:44:18] <%Superbro64> @andre11dr I imagine it had to be, for games to be arcade perfect or like, which I imagine was a selling point for the console (?)
[3:44:22] <bazz_tv> FC2 also has the new feature of ranks for some games
[3:44:31] <RyuuAoi> Trapped there for a sec
[3:44:31] <Hornssa> AES was home console, MVS arcade
[3:44:41] <TigerClaws12> yoooo PogChamp
[3:44:44] <@Menitta> thats sick
[3:44:44] <townzzzzz> NOICE
[3:44:47] <RyuuAoi> It was the corner trap brush
[3:44:49] <BlackermanZX> SICK
[3:44:52] <yusefHD> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[3:44:55] <RyuuAoi> Bruh
[3:44:55] <DianaTheAscian> PogChamp
[3:44:56] <+Joe2187> The fuck is this game
[3:45:02] <Hornssa> different form factor for the carts but the games were identical
[3:45:08] <andre11dr> I think it was like an arcade motherboard sold as a console @superbro64
[3:45:27] <bazz_tv> only canon teams can do the double super though
[3:45:27] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:45:33] <+paladinstarbuster> CHEESED
[3:45:46] <%Superbro64> I don't know anyone who would pay $250 for rage of the dragons in 2002, for sure
[3:45:47] <Hornssa> and there was the neo geo cd which was much cheaper but load times
[3:45:49] <$g0g3t4> gg
[3:45:51] <RyuuAoi> Good try
[3:45:55] <%Superbro64> I certainly did not have that kind of cash flow
[3:45:58] <%DSD24> Is the canon teams the characters right next to each other?
[3:46:05] <townzzzzz> yeah
[3:46:09] <%Superbro64> thank goodness I could grab a re-release today for like $20 or so
[3:46:10] <bazz_tv> yes
[3:46:12] <$g0g3t4> at least i got to show off duo super
[3:46:48] <bazz_tv> I think only Billy and Jimmy get a double super with eachother outside their canon partners
[3:47:03] <Hornssa> DEMON FLIP
[3:47:03] <%Superbro64> ala sfex3?
[3:47:14] <deafmelone> This character select music is the 2000 snk radical shit i LOVE

[3:48:47] <bazz_tv> Billy has like the perfect fusion of a flash kick and a power geiser
[3:48:56] <andre11dr> I know that i not supposed to be black, but what's the deal with Japan thinking all black people are albinos?
[3:49:02] <$g0g3t4> but yeh, abobo's code is up 4 down 3 left 2 right 1, and iirc theres time to try a few times

[4:05:10] <+Dova573> last
[4:05:14] <townzzzzz> sure
[4:05:37] <SpookyBeef7> Is Fightcade like Parsec in that you don't need the game if the host does, or do both sides still need to have access to the game itself?
[4:05:44] <townzzzzz> beat me to it
[4:06:03] <+Dova573> Also Pepe reals Name is Jose Ramirez
[4:06:05] <bazz_tv> yo a fellow Chilean in the lobby

[4:06:08] <MichaelDood> Abobobububoboo
[4:06:14] <+Dova573> Better name than pepe
[4:06:17] <GeltonZ> @SpookyBeef7 Both sides need it, but it's rollback netcode
[4:06:19] <%DSD24> Jose Ramriez is a rad name
[4:06:24] <townzzzzz> FC2 will try to download the roms that all players use
[4:06:37] <dunkle321> Oh look it's Potemkin
[4:06:39] <%DSD24> I like this design
[4:06:42] <townzzzzz> but not all games
[4:06:48] <SpookyBeef7> @GeltonZ Ah, okay, I'm gonna have to keep that in for the future.
[4:06:50] <bazz_tv> @townzzzzz the fightcade reddit had them
[4:06:55] <Hornssa> i hope abubo is literally just juggernaut
[4:07:04] <Itto27> yeah its UK based but also canadian Esports channel they did an interview with woolie and talked about his lets plays @akuda_bar
[4:07:04] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[4:07:44] <MichaelDood> sick
[4:07:57] <townzzzzz> that's some unga
[4:08:06] <Itto27> and they talked jojo Kappa
[4:08:13] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Dragons make me SO ANGRY, chat
[4:08:25] <Hornssa> understandable
[4:08:26] <Visored34> man Pepe is cool
[4:08:42] <+Dova573> Jimmy seems opresive
[4:08:45] <+Dova573> aff
[4:08:57] <bazz_tv> man look at those "msin characters in the background
[4:08:59] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Who make dis?
[4:09:03] <bazz_tv> main*
[4:09:10] <Hornssa> mexicans made this
[4:09:22] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Wow, really?
[4:09:31] <Itto27> si
[4:09:36] <+Dova573> apparently my people made this which I dint know about
[4:09:37] <bazz_tv> japan and Mexico
[4:09:39] <+Dova573> and thats sick
[4:09:45] <%Superbro64> stage hazards a real cool idea. Shame modern 2d fighters kinda abandoned adding anything gameplay effecting to their stages
[4:09:49] <%Superbro64> sans NRS
[4:10:04] <Hornssa> devs is evoga, don't know if they're still around
[4:10:13] <bazz_tv> they aren't
[4:10:25] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> YO ULLL
[4:10:28] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> ULLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
[4:10:30] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> I mean, I guess I'm not really all that familiar with Mexican video game development, but this seems pretty rad
[4:10:30] <Hornssa> wiki says they went bankrupt in 2004
[4:10:34] <townzzzzz> BALL'N
[4:10:52] <+Dova573> makes sense for mexico saldy
[4:10:54] <+Dova573> sadly
[4:10:57] <Itto27> wait is billy and jimmy double dragon?!?!
[4:11:12] <bazz_tv> now that is a wall juggle
[4:11:12] <Hornssa> wonder what the team members are up to these days
[4:11:14] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> ABUBOO
[4:11:18] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> FREE
[4:11:29] <townzzzzz> LUL
[4:11:32] <AlcoholicBlackGuy> FOOTSIES
[4:11:36] <+Dova573> Whiff
[4:11:38] <+Dova573> punish
[4:11:44] <$g0g3t4> yeh im aweful at fundies
[4:11:45] <%Superbro64> he made the air his hitbox
[4:11:47] <bazz_tv> the japanese half of the team still makes Power Instincts game I think
[4:12:07] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Oh hey, The Wold Among us
[4:12:14] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Is Woolie a Fables fan?
[4:12:15] <bazz_tv> though I think the last one was made a while ago
[4:12:25] <+Dova573> The wall bounce throws me off lol
[4:12:28] <MichaelDood> @Itto27 Yeah, it's an original take on the double dragon universe
[4:12:42] <Hornssa> holy shit they put out a power instinct in 2015???
[4:12:53] <Hornssa> Gōketsuji Ichizoku: Senzo Kuyō
[4:12:58] <bazz_tv> yeah
[4:13:03] <GeltonZ> Yup. I want it SO BAD.
[4:13:11] <@akuda_bar> @ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots they did an LP of it back when it was new, yeah, i dunno if he's read the comics
[4:13:13] <GeltonZ> It has a bunch of remixed Power Instinct 2 songs in it.
[4:13:26] <Itto27> wait is this SNK based or no?
[4:13:34] <bazz_tv> in fact some characters from these appear in matrimelee which is a power Instinct game
[4:13:35] <+Jaysky> The gals seem cute in this
[4:13:46] <Itto27> cause i saw the 4 button layout doesnt snk mostly do that
[4:13:49] <+Dova573> Now that I see it that girl clearly inspired by Psylocke
[4:13:51] <MichaelDood> Yeah published by snk
[4:13:52] <GeltonZ> @Itto27 It was a very very late Neo Geo release, yes.
[4:13:59] <Itto27> ahh ok
[4:14:00] <deafmelone> Groove On Fight is cool too
[4:14:02] <+Dova573> that stance is almost like hers
[4:14:03] <bazz_tv> @itto27 no, it runs on neo geo but is not snk
[4:14:20] <Itto27> thats what i mean like it belongs on neogeo
[4:14:20] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:14:33] <Itto27> did this every see a machine in the wild?
[4:14:41] <Hornssa> oh wait, Goketsuji Ichizoku Matsuri Senzo Kuyou came out in 2009, last updated in 2012
[4:14:52] <Hornssa> still wild it was that recent
[4:15:00] <dunkle321> Hey so what the fuck is Poochy in Matrimelee
[4:15:10] <bazz_tv> I did, but I'm south american, this games aren't as rare here
[4:15:22] <Itto27> wow
[4:15:24] <MichaelDood> I've played a Rage of the Dragons cab once here in texas.
[4:15:39] <bazz_tv> or they were at least, nowadays is hard to find arcades
[4:15:54] <%Superbro64> that's REAL cool.
[4:15:59] <townzzzzz> points matter
[4:16:06] <Hornssa> i love the point tally on time over, more games should do that
[4:16:11] <%koolaid_kevster> this game looks lit
[4:16:32] <townzzzzz> so low
[4:16:38] <+Dova573> yo
[4:16:40] <MichaelDood> SourPls
[4:16:42] <Itto27> i could fuck with this!
[4:16:45] <+vaporousTippler> Let it be said the final boss of this game is total bullshit. Like, beyond SNK levels.
[4:16:52] <bazz_tv> no BS judges on time out like Third strike lol
[4:16:55] <+zedreamcast> Poochy is a man who loved his dog so much, that when he died, his dog became a stand and possesses him when he fights.
[4:17:46] <MichaelDood> YEAH the Trans Am! LUL
[4:17:51] <Itto27> i like the trans am haha

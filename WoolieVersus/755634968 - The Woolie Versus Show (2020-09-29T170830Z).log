[1:12:12] <%emperordread> Remember that the mongols literally got introduced by burning a samurai - Norio be like "I learned it from you Khan-Dad!"
[1:12:12] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> andd then he got pneumonia and died
[1:12:17] <%doomerskeletor13> Yeah that was also a joke in Tales from the Borderlands
[1:12:25] <%Mr_Strut> Jin is dying of hypothermia right now

[1:15:09] <armchairmaster_> @woolieversus we could do some side quests until Minh comes back, in case he wants to see you FINISH THE FIGHT in person.
[1:15:30] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> is mongol armour an option?
[1:15:34] <misterurbanthelegend> ・・・
[1:15:40] <%BinaryFireball> dooo iiittt

[1:17:13] <armchairmaster_> Jin wants that new fit
[1:17:14] <+askalta> it was forged by japanese smith
[1:17:15] <$jake5713> Armor is armor.
[1:17:20] <sendart> its not technically mongol armor
[1:17:23] <+Arkfyre> No way, it's the ultimate ghost tech. Just walk right in unnoticed
[1:17:29] <+TheNeonGraveyard> It's 100% sneak tech
[1:17:44] <$jake5713> By any means necessary.
[1:18:14] <@SoushinSen> Honestly, i straight up tried to get the armor ASAP so i can wear it in front of Uncle Shimura.

[1:26:03] <pjbuster> @SaltkeyAndAckfish I wouldn't say that, the game gives you a lot of tools by this time
[1:26:20] <%fatigued_driving> Straight up usurped
[1:26:22] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> so then it's just easy?
[1:26:22] <+TheNeonGraveyard> "Are you sure The Ghost isn't really multiple people?" "IT WAS ONE GUY"
[1:26:29] <+EchoXOF> Shin Wilhelm
[1:26:49] <%doomerskeletor13> I mean you can get pretty fucked up quickly if you’re not playing well
[1:26:49] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> idk that healthbar seems a little more than tools
[1:27:15] <kenny_biff> auto parry happens when you're in the middle of an attack... I think
[1:27:23] <+thackattack00> that's correct
[1:27:48] <tonfirean> Yeah, the game isn't that hard on normal. I'm no leet gamer boy and I don't usually play this kind of game, but I got through it without much frustration.
[1:27:49] <Make_me_mad> @SaltkeyAndAckfish The game gets a lot easier as you go on, yes. The start of the game is pretty lethal where one mistake can kill you, and by the end you're nearly unstoppable. The enemies level up with you, but not nearly as much.

[1:29:06] <pjbuster> yea
[1:29:07] <+chiazam> Why does he never roll from a fall lmao
[1:29:18] <%doomerskeletor13> He played it for a bit but eventually abandoned it
[1:29:19] <HarmlessCrow> Pup snuffer :(
[1:29:19] <huskarl_zap> They're weapons of war
[1:29:21] <+thackattack00> yeah he played sekiro, never finished it tho
[1:29:22] <+babyacid> dont make me kill the doggos game
[1:29:22] <+TheNeonGraveyard> We don't talk about Sekiro
[1:29:28] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> i was gonna ask, how'd that go
[1:29:28] <tonfirean> There is some ebb and flow in that if you run out of "get out of jail free" cards like kunai and smoke bombs it gets harder. But it's pretty rare to run out.
[1:29:29] <huskarl_zap> as are war horses
[1:29:35] <%Mr_Strut> At least your not getting dumb flashbacks about their life with their owner
[1:29:35] <Make_me_mad> No one should have played Sekiro.
[1:29:39] <huskarl_zap> but killing people tho
[1:29:46] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> where they introduce new mechanics in response to enemy changes
[1:29:55] <huskarl_zap> Chad gols
[1:29:59] <+chiazam> HELMETS
[1:30:00] <whirly25> more like general dogshit haho
[1:30:01] <%Mr_Strut> Just tank multiple arrows to the neck
[1:30:04] <%doomerskeletor13> They should play the Grunt birthday noise when you kill then
[1:30:04] <%JetpackMcQuack> He was made to blow that horn

[1:30:45] <%Javaa01> Shoot the soft bits
[1:30:45] <therakishsage> Just shoot center mass.
[1:31:06] <+chiazam> The short bow can't pierce helmets, that's what the long bow is for
[1:31:07] <+askalta> longbow to the chest when they have iron helms
[1:31:13] <+askalta> oh
[1:31:16] <Pappajimbo> thats why its a bonus
[1:31:20] <+TheNeonGraveyard> you already have all the techniques maxed out right?
[1:31:24] <+Arkfyre> it's silly that a helet is doing what it's designed to do?
[1:31:37] <+chiazam> There were enemies that didn't have helmets
[1:31:37] <kenny_biff> you can still take out most helmetted enemies with a short bow, as long as you hit them in the face
[1:31:52] <tonfirean> Archers are weak, do those die in one from the shortbow?
[1:32:03] <Make_me_mad> Not everything needs to be a one shot kill.
[1:32:04] <sologarza> Aim at the face, that works with short bow
[1:32:26] <%JetpackMcQuack> I would expect a flinch but it is what it is
[1:32:35] <%Javaa01> No, that's the exact opposite of what everyone said Woolie

[1:33:31] <%Javaa01> The objective was completed
[1:33:34] <Make_me_mad> Woolie's technique was dumb but I can't argue with the results.

[2:06:31] <+GilroyGoldBlood> KAGE REBORN!
[2:06:32] <%doomerskeletor13> ENTIRE JOURNEY Kappa
[2:06:38] <pjbuster> kage was just taking a break
[2:06:44] <Make_me_mad> In the original game they remove the original horse you chose from this selection.
[2:06:46] <eldragon_1> Shadowfax was white LUL
[2:06:47] <%doomerskeletor13> Kage just needed to heal
[2:06:49] <Make_me_mad> So you can never get that horse back.
[2:06:55] <yusefHD> Nobuuuu
[2:06:59] <+GilroyGoldBlood> @Make_me_mad Made me so mad. I wanted another white horse
[2:07:02] <Make_me_mad> This digital deluxe thing is NONSENSE.
[2:07:02] <misterurbanthelegend> Nobu

[2:08:28] <misterurbanthelegend> Damnit let it Die!!
[2:08:35] <@Menitta> Now go! Let the legend come back to life!
[2:08:35] <Make_me_mad> This is one of a few instances I've seen where I think the digital deluxe stuff in this game has actually made the game worse.
[2:08:36] <+Arkfyre> Now go, your legends beings now!
[2:08:38] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[2:08:44] <+TheNeonGraveyard> let the legend be reborn
[2:08:51] <+GilroyGoldBlood> And so ends Jins journey
[2:09:13] <%Mr_Strut> Now I just want mongols mocking Jin for his dead horse
[2:09:14] <huskarl_zap> Drive a truck over them
[2:09:15] <misterurbanthelegend> 2 secs out of the gate and its fucked
[2:09:16] <@Menitta> Its like several feet deep too
[2:09:41] <%Mr_Strut> It's a healthy fear to have
[2:09:43] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Woolie the Coward
[2:09:50] <%Mr_Strut> Even if irrational
[2:09:51] <pjbuster> I feel the same way about skydiving
[2:09:53] <%doomerskeletor13> People put entire sheds out on the lake when it’s frozen where I am. Literally drive their trucks out there. Every year we get at least one car that falls in
[2:09:58] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Fuck that video
[2:10:03] <yusefHD> LUL LUL
[2:10:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh fuck
[2:10:06] <%emperordread> I've seen plenty of videos where a guy goes from hole to hole Kreygasm
[2:10:08] <@Menitta> wait seriously?!
[2:10:09] <misterurbanthelegend> I did that shit as a kid.
[2:10:14] <@Menitta> A fucking CAR?!
[2:10:18] <pjbuster> bruh that actually scary
[2:10:25] <@Menitta> WHY CONTINUE DOING THAT
[2:10:36] <%Mr_Strut> Ice swimming is fucking terrifying
[2:10:36] <+TheNeonGraveyard> film your friend's death for internet content
[2:10:50] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Woolie wants head
[2:10:51] <+Aeoneth> Evidently YES Woolie
[2:11:04] <+GilroyGoldBlood> So no head?
[2:11:04] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:11:09] <Make_me_mad> Ghost Stance isn't caused by scaring the enemies, it's all in Jin's head.
[2:11:12] <%doomerskeletor13> @menitta Ye it happens so much that one company bought a junker truck and did a whole contest where they put it on the frozen lake and had people guess how long until it fell in
[2:11:19] <Make_me_mad> He has to build his confidence to activate it.
[2:11:27] <@Menitta> NotLikeThis
[2:11:33] <Make_me_mad> Taking a hit makes him feel bad about himself and he loses his groove.
[2:11:39] <@Menitta> admittedly that is pretty funny
[2:11:40] <yusefHD> what ends up happening is that Jen gets really hype and wants to kill everybody cuz they didn't see him do that awesome Glory kill
[2:11:44] <@Menitta> but still a waste lmao
[2:11:46] <+Arkfyre> There's an area here just outside of montreal where in the summer you take a ferry across the water. But in the winter the ice is thick enough that you can just drive across the ice.
[2:12:56] <%doomerskeletor13> ITS GROWING
[2:12:59] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ROLL CREDITS
[2:13:05] <%Livelinne> Roll credit!
[2:13:09] <Make_me_mad> That is a really anticlimactic final charm unlock.

[2:14:15] <%doomerskeletor13> LUL
[2:14:23] <Make_me_mad> Reminder: This game is hilariously historically inaccurate. The Mongols steamrolled this island so hard it can barely be believed.
[2:14:40] <@Menitta> [Leonardo Dicaprio pointing]
[2:14:43] <yusefHD> LUL LUL LUL
[2:14:46] <%doomerskeletor13> @make_me_mad The game isn’t trying to be historically accurate lmao
[2:14:52] <SomersaultJustice> Nier Automata
[2:15:00] <Equirah> @Make_me_mad par for the course with every historic game
[2:15:01] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Baller you say?
[2:15:03] <%bread_assassin> Nier Automata's was like 30hrs in.
[2:15:09] <T_Sasquatch> Nier automata has like 5 title drops LUL
[2:15:09] <pjbuster> yooo nier automata had me hyped
[2:15:10] <%doomerskeletor13> Fargo Season 4 just did a 20 minute intro before their title drop
[2:15:14] <Make_me_mad> @doomerskeletor13 I didn't say that it was. I just find it funny that the game is a valiant fight against the invading army when historically the island just got rocked.
[2:15:22] <@Menitta> Automata had a fucking sequel trailer drop
[2:15:23] <+TheNeonGraveyard> khublai khan was at Tsushima, khotun died 6 years before the invasion
[2:15:25] <@Menitta> Mid game
[2:15:27] <@Menitta> it's sick
[2:15:31] <yusefHD> Mummy was flawless
[2:15:37] <$BallerSwagBro9k> What about when the title drops just before the credits? @woolieversus
[2:15:42] <@Menitta> Oh fuck I gotta see Perdition
[2:15:45] <misterurbanthelegend> Nolan Trilogy
[2:16:02] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Avatar did that
[2:16:09] <%Lion_kun> Nier Automata. Title drop after beating the game twice.
[2:16:18] <huskarl_zap> there was am omception two?
[2:16:22] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> THE LION KING
[2:16:33] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> chills
[2:16:36] <@Menitta> Its SO GOOD
[2:16:43] <%doomerskeletor13> @huskarl_zap He’s saying Inception, too
[2:16:50] <@Menitta> I hate that it took a pandemic for me to play that game
[2:16:51] <pjbuster> legitimately great
[2:16:59] <%Javaa01> """"Replays""""
[2:17:03] <%emperordread> Neir automata to me sounds like someone saying "Near a tomato" and it will never be the same
[2:17:06] <+Arkfyre> It's not really replays
[2:17:10] <$BallerSwagBro9k> I love Automata but it makes me depressed AF
[2:17:11] <huskarl_zap> @doomerskeletor13 ahh okay
[2:17:14] <@Menitta> You replay it technically once
[2:17:19] <pjbuster> it's from different perspectives
[2:17:20] <%Exiliator> Its like fake replays
[2:17:27] <@Menitta> then its a sequel
[2:17:30] <@Menitta> ye
[2:17:32] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> You only loop once
[2:17:50] <@Menitta> Nier Automata doesn't start until Mission 5C
[2:18:06] <pjbuster> the first loop was just the prolounge

[2:48:50] <%Livelinne> buffpupCry
[2:48:58] <yusefHD> sir the ghost of tsushima just slapped my fucking bird in mid-air
[2:49:12] <jorniev> reminds me of the falconer in Sotn
[2:49:20] <%Javaa01> Yeah I think this is your point of no return mission next

[2:52:52] <+jiggy_snipe> not so pure Reggie
[2:52:57] <pjbuster> morally grey reggie
[2:52:57] <yusefHD> the real tragedy is they scooped out this guy's knee caps and he can't jump
[2:53:03] <+jiggy_snipe> Reggievil
[2:53:19] <%cobalt_phoenix_> we all thought reggie was pure but he is showing us his greyness
[2:53:46] <CappuccinoGuil> @cobalt_phoenix_ I showed you my greyness, answer me
[2:53:46] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1310937719246385153?s=19
[2:54:24] <%flarebears> Later Woolie and Reggie, Finally time for the exam. Gonna nail these logarithms and UTP questions.
[2:54:41] <pjbuster> good luck
[2:54:48] <huskarl_zap> darkish grey reggie
[2:55:21] <huskarl_zap> Relativism Reggie
[2:55:52] <pjbuster> Relatively rugal reggie

[2:57:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that's rough buddy
[2:57:57] <CappuccinoGuil> Do ANY of these sidequests end well?
[2:58:06] <%Livelinne> t101AAA t101AAA t101AAA t101AGH
[2:58:08] <%cobalt_phoenix_> that's gotta be the worst way to find out you're not the favorite
[2:58:20] <yusefHD> pretty sure this was a Maury episode at one point
[2:58:41] <pjbuster> "god took the wrong son"
[2:59:01] <jorniev> "im not the old monster everyone says i am" *cut to* "shoot him with kindness boys"
[2:59:04] <T_Sasquatch> One thing I love about jin is that he explicitly says he doesn't enjoy killing
[2:59:34] <%RyTYoung> But he's G at it Kappa
[2:59:56] <jorniev> he is too good for some who does it 24/7
[2:59:57] <pjbuster> her gratitude
[3:00:11] <yusefHD> it was probably technique points but you maxed out
[3:00:29] <kenny_biff> I dislike the "peasant gives you something" animation when you get absolutely nothing
[3:00:30] <%RyTYoung> BibleThump
[3:00:32] <+vaderxyz1970> Its so igsinfifcant Jin doest even acknolage it
[3:00:35] <%Mr_Strut> He lost his own digital deluxe horse
[3:00:48] <%Livelinne> Oh oh
[3:00:48] <pjbuster> oh
[3:00:49] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:00:52] <+jiggy_snipe> hmmm
[3:01:02] <+jiggy_snipe> lol this mission
[3:01:08] <+Sliverits> :(
[3:01:12] <%Livelinne> shiaFeels
[3:01:15] <pjbuster> this is the saddest mission
[3:01:17] <+jiggy_snipe> every point is just misery
[3:01:25] <%RyTYoung> He mustve flew off the cliff Kappa
[3:01:33] <Make_me_mad> No shuffled footprings at the cliffside, though. The flipped right out of his shoes.
[3:01:46] <yusefHD> at least the charm was it for swim speed up
[3:01:52] <%Livelinne> woolieMIRIN
[3:02:08] <+jiggy_snipe> good session
[3:02:12] <jorniev> did he already do norio?
[3:02:17] <+jiggy_snipe> yep
[3:02:23] <%doomerskeletor13> Good sesh gebts
[3:02:26] <%doomerskeletor13> Gents
[3:02:29] <%Livelinne> !motivated
[3:02:29] <@Moobot> 1724 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[3:02:32] <+jiggy_snipe> he unlocked Norio's DT
[3:02:46] <%Livelinne> !uptime
[3:02:46] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 2 minutes
[3:02:48] <%doomerskeletor13> You could def finish the game on Thursday I think
[3:03:04] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @woolieversus will you be doing a GIFG for KOF 2002 UM for the rollback beta?
[3:03:37] <%Livelinne> Oh hey new figures in background. Bye Levi
[3:04:28] <%Javaa01> Yeah I don't believe in 60% wired
[3:04:47] <+jiggy_snipe> It's possible if the PC crowd is huge
[3:05:04] <+Arkfyre> NA console players LUL
[3:05:14] <%Javaa01> The PC crowd is meaningful, but it's still far from being a majority platform
[3:05:19] <CrimsonGargoyle> who woulda seen that coming Kappa
[3:05:37] <armchairmaster_> Wait, how far did they get since i've been gone?
[3:05:51] <armchairmaster_> Last thing I saw was norio activating ghost stance
[3:06:03] <+jiggy_snipe> it doesn't seem it has a sufficient frame buffer or any prediction so there's no point
[3:06:36] <+jiggy_snipe> 99.9 wifi on switch Kappa
[3:07:03] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Why does Nintendo do half the things they do?
[3:07:18] <DatAsuna> Nintendo are very penny pincher about that kinda stuff
[3:07:30] <DatAsuna> Remember with new 3DS they did't even include a fucking charger??
[3:07:34] <pjbuster> general question but is wired play always better than wifi play?
[3:07:38] <+jiggy_snipe> very late to the party on anything
[3:07:52] <armchairmaster_> @pjbuster yes, 100% of the time
[3:07:53] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:08:09] <DatAsuna> IN this case it's not even nintendo being late tho, just cheap
[3:08:25] <+jiggy_snipe> @pjbuster always better but won't save crap interest
[3:08:29] <%Reverend_Roscoe> GIFG?
[3:08:31] <+jiggy_snipe> internet*
[3:08:35] <+desfore> Unless you have like, a fucked up cable or something; Wired will be more reliable than WiFi
[3:08:55] <%Reverend_Roscoe> YEYEYE
[3:09:02] <@Menitta> Ever since that announcement I started practicing
[3:09:02] <+joyfuload> fighting game AI improvement would be nice, but don't waste resources on it

[0:27:27] <$konekoryugamine> I wanna watch Kakegurui first
[0:27:30] <%CaptainPileDriver> no, fuck it, everybody go watch beastars, i will fight everyone
[0:27:33] <$konekoryugamine> Nope.
[0:27:34] <barucafe> is this before or after game
[0:27:41] <judgefudge9> KOJUMBO WAS RIGHT!!!!!
[0:27:45] <honeyman18> woolieOMG_BE cursed
[0:27:45] <+AMagicalFlute> woolie vs reading
[0:27:49] <andrei11dr> I think Kirby should be switch yo yellow, because yellow means fear for some reason @woolieversus
[0:27:57] <+Reaverund> Ive been trying to program from home with Twitch in the background for the last week. It's kind of unproductive lol.
[0:27:58] <$konekoryugamine> I got nothing
[0:27:59] <+D00msDayDan> excuse me did he just say passover
[0:27:59] <+lethallunacyx> World of Horror? sweet
[0:28:01] <MyNameIsRasus> Woolie vs literacy
[0:28:04] <+jiggy_snipe> lol Jenova
[0:28:05] <$konekoryugamine> Yep, World of Horror
[0:28:12] <%tearknack> MENORA, JEHOVA
[0:28:18] <%Javaa01> Woolie vs 20/20 vision
[0:28:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> use a desk chair
[0:28:20] <honeyman18> Dreamcatcher and Beeswax cremes
[0:28:21] <blazedauron> so who else works in the food industry and is scared about not having a paycheck once your restaurant closes
[0:28:24] <PleasantLeech> yellow means fear because it's the easiest color for our eye to notice
[0:28:24] <%Ecchigun> do not play the spider god , just reset LUL
[0:28:31] <BoneofMalkav> Jenovah, Menora, Dora Dora, MUDA...
[0:28:31] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:28:39] <%tearknack> ay
[0:28:44] <stachystat> All I did was say this meal is good enough for Jehova!
[0:28:58] <%tearknack> punchmom makingg references that woolie doesn't get for once
[0:29:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> just do what kiryu would do, PUNCH THAT CAT IN THE HEAD
[0:29:05] <+D00msDayDan> @WoolieVersus menorahs are for hanuka, not passover
[0:29:11] <+RenoDeGeneric> Think of the SYMBOLISM
[0:29:27] <ArtooKilledYou> Trianglent
[0:29:29] <MyNameIsRasus> Use a table with knives superglued on it
[0:29:44] <Reverend_Roscoe> granblue on pc or ps4?
[0:29:44] <breadprices> the ultimate lion-fighting weapon would be a chair with blades instead of legs
[0:29:46] <DesDavis> Granblue is a good starter fighter
[0:29:53] <gsoto83> Animal Eternal : Doom Crossing
[0:29:55] <%CaptainPileDriver> play to learn
[0:29:57] <RaidenKyrielight> granblue is my favourite fighting game right now
[0:29:59] <$konekoryugamine> Which in Japanese is 恐怖の世界
[0:30:06] <%GeneralSCPatton> Cheer500 Get that escapist catharsis. Elder Gods are infinitely more punchable than a pandemic, or global warming, or the erosion of democracy by late stage capitalism. Give me a 13 dimensional being that can eat time itself any day. I can at least pretend to swing at it with my tiny mortal hands.
[0:30:13] <RaidenKyrielight> It's not overly complicated and easy to understand
[0:30:15] <$konekoryugamine> "Kyoufu no sekai"
[0:30:15] <nothuzad> also dlc characters are dropping in fast for GB VS
[0:30:23] <$konekoryugamine> For once my Japanese knowledge pays off
[0:30:44] <waffleandman> this game is surprisingly simple
[0:30:50] <TigerClaws12> use it at the same time
[0:30:53] <Prevot> big shits for big boys
[0:30:54] <%StaceMcGate> Is KOTOR 2 LP on hiatus?
[0:30:56] <matsukaze20> Race to the bathroom
[0:30:56] <PleasantLeech> time for big piss action
[0:30:57] <MaxXtreme23> @konekoryugamine hilariously one of the reviews for the game pointed out that the japanese stuff in the game is mostly nonsense
[0:30:58] <nothuzad> brafrum
[0:31:00] <$konekoryugamine> Yeah unless you get the worst elder god doom note
[0:31:00] <+ClericOfSparda> streamer man!
[0:31:02] <RaidenKyrielight> i was expecting massive 30 hit combos and endless pressure
[0:31:05] <$konekoryugamine> It is.
[0:31:07] <%Scarnehu> go to BRB
[0:31:09] <$konekoryugamine> It super is, most of the time.
[0:31:12] <$konekoryugamine> But the typos are prominent
[0:31:18] <lloyddboy> You stay. I go. No following.
[0:31:24] <MaxXtreme23> i laughed when i got hit by "Insmasu Syndrome"
[0:31:24] <$konekoryugamine> And the Kuchisaki onna is a thing that does appear
[0:31:27] <$konekoryugamine> So yay
[0:31:37] <judgefudge9> Big pp
[0:31:41] <@Commando_Joe> enjoy your pee woolie
[0:31:45] <honeyman18> Wash Hands
[0:31:52] <stachystat> Good luck punch-mom
[0:32:01] <$konekoryugamine> Also, don't do the thing that will make you insane.
[0:32:10] <MaxXtreme23> but a lot of things make you insane
[0:32:16] <$konekoryugamine> That makes you lose your reason and increases Doom
[0:32:22] <+The_Timo> I just got a news update about Quebec having a bunch more cases today
[0:32:23] <+R_BChe> the animal villagers are infected FeelsBadMan
[0:32:25] <gsoto83> PUNCH MOM is Prime canadiate from So.Serv
[0:32:28] <mMayrro> when's mahvvel tho Kappa
[0:32:33] <+RenoDeGeneric> @Commando_Joe Man what stream aren't you a mod in? Saw you in Octopimp's chat the other night
[0:32:34] <+kapcommunist> playing AC on the 3DS?
[0:32:37] <%derap41> Yeah but its for 2-3 months
[0:32:39] <@Commando_Joe> >_>
[0:32:45] <primaryfire> lots of people are having classes from home now though
[0:32:50] <nothuzad> RenoDeGeneric none :)
[0:32:51] <Agami23> social services must have it rough right now
[0:32:53] <%Ecchigun> everyone is banned to work
[0:32:56] <RaidenKyrielight> couple months
[0:32:58] <QaizerArt> Are you having a good time with the extra time off?
[0:33:01] <%tearknack> @WoolieVersus hey punchmom, is woolie a Monty Python virgin? Has he not seen/heard the good shit
[0:33:08] <JetpackMcQuack> Too big to dodge
[0:33:13] <+gustavozxd> my classes aren't cancelled but they allowed people to not go, my dad is 67 so I got worried and decided not to go
[0:33:21] <ArtooKilledYou> Hit box too many frames
[0:33:24] <Prevot> punchmom's hair looking just like Resident Evil 3 Jill
[0:33:25] <+DesertPenguin> Sucks working in a grocery store though
[0:33:26] <42nfl19> I am also telecommuting for work. Hope you don't get stiry crazy.
[0:33:27] <19DarkKnight87> I work in a call center, so we're not closing
[0:33:34] <%derap41> Bored of reddit better open reddot
[0:33:58] <@Commando_Joe> You're getting hit with the MMO/Mobile Game pressure
[0:34:00] <%Th3SmartAlec> I thought she was talking about real life
[0:34:01] <+gustavozxd> LUL
[0:34:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[0:34:04] <%optimasmaximas> not getting re-elected smh
[0:34:04] <+jiggy_snipe> ugh I hate when games feel like an obligation lol
[0:34:08] <%Theycallmenerf> My dad has always been a huge Doom fan and he never got into Doom 2016, I introduced him to it and he has Doom Eternal Day in his Calendar. If you need to binge a game with self isolation, I recommend Doom 2016 and when Doom Eternal comes out. Also happy Saint Patrick's Day!
[0:34:13] <+Parrish_broadnax> yo the mayor you in charge
[0:34:14] <%ozzrabbit> Hey PunchMom! Any chance of you getting behind the controller on stream? I’d like to see an LP on this channel by a Streaming Virgin such as yourself.
[0:34:15] <gsoto83> Punch mom is rude mayor, not talk to everyone, NEWS AT 11!
[0:34:15] <@Commando_Joe> Games should not have homework tripRage
[0:34:18] <honeyman18> Nah, they're fine. Isabelle has all the real power
[0:34:23] <YakumoYomi> I'm a corporate janitor, so my work is largely unaffected. Execs are still coming in, so I still have to go in to clean.
[0:34:45] <Prevot> isabelle is like "mr mayor it's time for your 4pm dick flattening"
[0:34:50] <PleasantLeech> Hey punch mom what's your actual name?
[0:34:56] <WalkingErection01> this next AC will be my first ever but im super worried about how time works in game bc i feel like ill only be on when its like midnight
[0:35:06] <+Parrish_broadnax> it will have co-op
[0:35:07] <@Commando_Joe> It's Punchella Momma @PleasantLeech

[0:40:05] <Shion963> there's no timer in WoH so you can take your time to decide, plus Woolie's there to help!
[0:40:07] <+kapcommunist> woolie can carry with commentary this way
[0:40:09] <andrei11dr> You're probably gonna bolt die quick and its runs like a rogue like anyway so you can pass on dead @woolieversus
[0:40:10] <+Ches_Neckbeard> being bad at games is like the basis of streaming
[0:40:11] <%Gamefriendly> ooof
[0:40:14] <Manwad> it's a slow paced, turn based RPG with lots of reading.
[0:40:14] <YakumoYomi> No stress. Punchmom will do great.
[0:40:15] <Cozy90> I got one hour before bed lets roll!
[0:40:15] <FackinCrazy> So now that punch mom is a big streamer girl what condiment is she going to drink ?

[0:45:26] <%derap41> Dark Souls Though
[0:45:33] <%ozzrabbit> If it makes you feel any better, and you need a backup plan, why not try Monkey Island? It’s simple, and not scary at all. A decent introduction for all intents and purposes.
[0:45:35] <$konekoryugamine> Ask Pat what his thing was that helped him stream it.
[0:45:38] <blackkanye> I have a lot of weird shit eiwth my elgatos

[0:04:49] <%Will9099> woolieDATTEBAYO
[0:05:36] <%MyNameIsRasus> This game really makes me mad that the same segment of plot in the anime took over four years to get through
[0:05:36] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:05:42] <andrex2311> SourPls
[0:05:59] <+maenos2> what's this song? gerudo valley I recognize but like version
[0:06:02] <@Solidus_113> I leave for 2 minutes to make lunch, and you fools just drop spoilers
[0:06:09] <Zebroneath> This part in the anime had too much fucking filler, it was insulting.
[0:06:22] <SolGainer> chat behave
[0:06:30] <Snailgal> No!!
[0:06:30] <Arblaster_> It's so silent
[0:06:34] <%MyNameIsRasus> Even in the manga the pacing was fucking awful
[0:06:39] <%Solidnick18> wooliePOYO wooliePOYO
[0:06:44] <Arblaster_> Oh nevermind twitch was just buggy
[0:06:55] <+My_name_is_julio> I'm quivering with anticipation
[0:06:55] <dekkitout> That filler arc that retold the Naruto story was pretty nice
[0:07:10] <ThornJay> which one?
[0:07:22] <0rond> is the kakashi filler arc that came around the ninja world war canon?
[0:07:22] <+My_name_is_julio> dotodoMain dotodoMain dotodoMain
[0:07:24] <dekkitout> The one where Narutos parents didnt die
[0:07:29] <+Bluydee> the manga pacing sucked when it was coming out but it’s actually pretty good when you reread it
[0:07:34] <Shishi1205> Is this song one of the most versioned zelda songs?
[0:07:35] <andrex2311> Ah yes... My favorite hentai tag... Nuns...
[0:07:41] <%Solidnick18> woolieOMG woolieOMG
[0:07:43] <%ChoculaUltra> They shoulda had more slice of life filler like Bleach or that one episode when they tried to demask Kakashi imo
[0:07:51] <%projectmanatees> how many alt accounts would obito make to win rin's give aways
[0:08:07] <Shishi1205> All of them with the help of white zetsu
[0:08:07] <%MyNameIsRasus> @andrex2311 the one where she's also a succubus man? woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM
[0:08:08] <SolGainer> infinite tsukuyomi accounts
[0:08:09] <+peppament> 7
[0:08:10] <%Irridium> the only good filler is Gintama filler
[0:08:14] <Personified134> AWAKEN YOUR WOOLIEGANS
[0:08:21] <%gatorafan> @projectmanatees, you know that's what Zetsu is for
[0:08:22] <%Reverend_Roscoe> RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW!
[0:08:22] <0rond> there was that filler arc that retold kakashi's story basically from birth up until he first met team 7, and it's very nice
[0:08:26] <%MyNameIsRasus> Shenanigan = woke
[0:08:33] <mdkcde> @projectmanatees as many white zetsus he can get his hands on
[0:08:47] <andrex2311> @MyNameIsRasus Yes
[0:09:00] <%ChoculaUltra> “I was her only fan before Onlyfans!” - Obito
[0:09:03] <WG101> alright, where did woolie leave off last time?
[0:09:08] <0rond> like, he had a team before team 7 that he was very rough on, and sent back to the academy, and than someone talked with him, I think guy, and that made him be softer and kinder towards team 7
[0:09:16] <%MyNameIsRasus> Anyone here remembers the fucking Bikouchuu bug?
[0:09:16] <ThornJay> wasnt there an arc about itachi having a child "lover" that he murdered hard as well?
[0:09:21] <Man_in_the_Red> so, is this the first NUNS4 stream?
[0:09:28] <mdkcde> @WG101 Just after wining against the SImp of the Six Paths
[0:09:30] <gekizenbu> third
[0:09:35] <%MyNameIsRasus> Third strem
[0:09:36] <WG101> @mdkcde cool, thanks
[0:09:36] <dekkitout> Previously, all went according to Mad Lad Madara's keikaku
[0:09:40] <+Bluydee> it’s from itachi gaiden
[0:09:46] <%ChoculaUltra> Like maybe the 3rd Nuns4 stream iirc?
[0:09:49] <%MyNameIsRasus> TN: keikaku means plan
[0:10:11] <0rond> there's that image, of a marionette piloting a marionette piloting a marionette etc, and that fits naruto so damm well
[0:10:12] <andrex2311> @Man_in_the_Red Third Nuns stream
[0:10:25] <SSBBfan666> so, regarding the Boruto series, do you think CC2 should do what Capcom does and have continued support with Storm 4 and slowly add in the new era characters for the ongoing series, or just go to make a STORM 5?
[0:10:27] <357Sneak> SourPls
[0:10:28] <WG101> oh are talking about Hyuuga Hiashi's Plan of Hyuuga Bloodline Dominance?

[0:11:09] <0rond> yeah
[0:11:10] <mdkcde> @SSBBfan666 I've been told they included stuff from the movie Boruto on this game
[0:11:17] <%lotharrio> Just gotta get those Uzumaki genes in them...

[0:11:38] <dekkitout> Those Uzamaki and their big chakras
[0:11:42] <%projectmanatees> remember when john cena's wrestlemaina match was just the end of EVA
[0:11:44] <Personified134> coolest guy meme
[0:11:46] <mdkcde> Shame because THE last would've been better, I would love to see Woolie's reaction to the ENTIRE FEMALE POPULATION of konoha going after Naruto's dick
[0:11:52] <WG101> SENJU A SHIT, SUCK IT UCHIHA @MyNameIsRasus
[0:11:53] <Shishi1205> One thing do we know anything about the Namikazes?
[0:11:59] <Shishi1205> CAn't remember
[0:12:08] <DemonicHoward> no
[0:12:18] <%lotharrio> @MyNameIsRasus HINATA, I LOVE YOU, BUT YOUR DUTY IS TO MARRY NARUTO AND BE THE MOTHER OF HIS CHIL-hey, why is your nose bleeding?
[0:12:19] <SSBBfan666> @mdkcde would have preferred if Naruto got with someone else as well.
[0:12:20] <0rond> well I don't think boruto on it's own has enough characters yet to support a modern storm game
[0:12:25] <countgaculatv> Namikazes are unimportant
[0:12:25] <DemonicHoward> also remember naruto isnt directly related to the first
[0:12:26] <%deviljhojho_> actiate your borutnengan
[0:12:29] <%Ashenik1> Ihave tosay Obito is pretty fucking cool exept his simp motivations.
[0:12:30] <%deviljhojho_> or someshit i dunno
[0:12:42] <mdkcde> @SSBBfan666 This is SasuHina chatroom, I'm gonna ask you to leave.
[0:12:43] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[0:12:45] <%MyNameIsRasus> @lotharrio Is Hyuuga Hiashi just Naruto Chris Redfield?
[0:12:49] <%Wool> We're on a strict schedule today, hopefully we get to the hype fight before Ninjala.
[0:12:53] <Personified134> what does obito even have other than being a simp @Ashenik1
[0:12:55] <@Solidus_113> oh hey, I found some Narutomaki in my instant ramen
[0:12:57] <@Solidus_113> how fitting
[0:12:58] <Shishi1205> Not to the first but yes to his wife
[0:12:58] <yaboiiunclephil> Obito became garbage the INSTANT the mask came off
[0:13:01] <0rond> god sasuhina is actually the worst ship
[0:13:02] <fist_wizard_jay> Obito did it for the coochie
[0:13:04] <ThornJay> unlike naruto, minato actually wins through hard work
[0:13:08] <%Solidnick18> i got ninjala ready FeelsGoodMan
[0:13:08] <SSBBfan666> @mdkcde chill bro, im also fine with that ship
[0:13:12] <nepwar> @Solidus_113 an omen if you will
[0:13:15] <+hawk_rush> @Solidus_113 nice
[0:13:25] <countgaculatv> Man the word Simp ruined everything lol
[0:13:29] <%Kriss1827> im at work so cant play ninjala :/
[0:13:29] <Personified134> WORD LIFE
[0:13:34] <%Solidnick18> Oh shit
[0:13:36] <%Solidnick18> SourPls
[0:13:37] <%Ashenik1> @Personified134 spend his whole life manipulating the entire ninja world
[0:13:39] <%lotharrio> @MyNameIsRasus Technically, I think Chris is Capcom's Hiashi, since that memery happened years before I, at least, heard of the Redfield lineage imperative.
[0:13:43] <$megamonmon123> all Im saying is obito just needed some puss and hed be chill
[0:13:43] <Shishi1205> Translated is Fishcake right? or sth like that
[0:13:43] <%Kriss1827> SourPls
[0:13:45] <+My_name_is_julio> who else has crazy quarantine hair?

[0:13:55] <$megamonmon123> I do @my_name_is_julio
[0:13:56] <%ggbhtg> My internet is SHEEEITTING itself right now, great
[0:13:58] <nepwar> obito you no yourself when you haven't had some puss
[0:13:59] <+Bluydee> obito was never the greatest character but I feel like the game made him come off whinier and more pathetic than the manga did
[0:13:59] <StarkAvKnark> Yeyeyeyeye
[0:14:01] <0rond> I gotta say it's upsetting when people say naruto won though only genes and special powers and no hard work, naruto's abilites worked against him at first, he tamed them using hard work and kindness
[0:14:01] <SSBBfan666> can we all just admit Kishi threw out Naruto's theme to make him Jesus 2.0?
[0:14:03] <%gatorafan> Hiashi Hyuga plays Crusader Kings 2 all day, every day.
[0:14:06] <dekkitout> @My_name_is_julio My afro's power grows by the day
[0:14:06] <Aracon_> SourPls
[0:14:13] <$megamonmon123> no obito was pretty whiny in the manga
[0:14:16] <fist_wizard_jay> When you decide to murder and ruin a lot of people’s lives, then start the 4th Great Ninja War all for the sake of coochie
[0:14:21] <countgaculatv> @mdkcde and ultimately became a battle cry for everyone to point fingers at people.
[0:14:29] <muniea3> Woolie better watch the anime Guy fight after the game fight
[0:14:29] <%Ashenik1> Ok lets say this Obito < Tobi
[0:14:31] <BallerSwagBro9k> Yo this shit SLAPS
[0:14:37] <0rond> coochie is the most noble goal there is
[0:14:40] <SSBBfan666> Rin still would have gotten with Kakashi if she survived and grew up, Obito was too beta
[0:14:42] <$megamonmon123> @ashenik1 yeah thats true af
[0:14:42] <BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYEYEYEYEYYE
[0:14:43] <Shishi1205> Imaginary coochie too
[0:14:45] <%ChoculaUltra> best intro ever.
[0:14:45] <BallerSwagBro9k> BELIEVE IT
[0:14:46] <%gatorafan> OH SHIT
[0:14:46] <countgaculatv> Tobi was stupid regardless lol
[0:14:46] <Personified134> hot take: naruto was never about hard work vs talent, that was a theme for like 3 fights but those 3 fights were incredibly memorable so the idea stuck

[0:17:03] <%ChoculaUltra> lets be real - its been the weekend for a hot 2 months now for a lot of us.
[0:17:05] <%ggbhtg> BAN EVERYTHING for the greater good
[0:17:07] <Shishi1205> @0rond he said so sometime
[0:17:09] <+My_name_is_julio> Yeah mfs be workin on Tuesday
[0:17:13] <nepwar> wow that a strict window
[0:17:19] <%Wool> NINJALA CBT
[0:17:28] <%ChoculaUltra> Nintendo is being weird as hell when they really don't have to be
[0:17:33] <%ggbhtg> Tha stayte offitt
[0:17:36] <andrex2311> nintendo's online sucks
[0:17:39] <Shishi1205> Never
[0:17:42] <andrex2311> it always have
[0:17:45] <%rubbishbinge> nintendon't do online
[0:17:46] <fist_wizard_jay> I was reloading the stream on my phone, did someone speak on shit they werent supposed to?
[0:17:47] <Shishi1205> They refuse
[0:17:51] <+Masamune195> no one FAX'd them the memo
[0:17:52] <muniea3> they all had usb adapters though
[0:17:54] <arikk42> are you gonna play MVC 1 someday ?
[0:18:01] <%MyNameIsRasus> MUDA
[0:18:05] <nepwar> nintendo hates internet like ole timely people that hated cameras because it took their souls
[0:18:11] <%ggbhtg> This new company that put 1 billion dollars into Nintendo recently may help
[0:18:20] <countgaculatv> I remember complaining about how games do too much online stuff. How the turns have tabled.
[0:18:35] <0rond> honestly at some point the nintendo boomers will die and people will know what online is
[0:18:36] <andrex2311> Ninja CBT sounds like a really specific type of hentai
[0:19:02] <%ggbhtg> How many views does Mike Z's vid have
[0:19:03] <0rond> which naruto characters are into CBt?
[0:19:03] <EASrake> Whaaa, are you telling me that air is a worse conductor than copper?
[0:19:05] <nepwar> @countgaculatv i miss local co-op and would scarifice online for more co-op
[0:19:08] <fist_wizard_jay> Oh we talking Wifi Warriors again?
[0:19:10] <Shishi1205> yeah is the change
[0:19:22] <+TheOneCalledRock> @countgaculatv FOR REAL. I remember complaining that devs need to stop caring about online stuff so much. shit got monkey pawed
[0:19:25] <fist_wizard_jay> Get Pat ‘Red Bars go Die’ Boiven here
[0:19:29] <nepwar> i feel shino is strong on CBT
[0:19:30] <countgaculatv> @nepwar I’d agree with you if I lived near more like minded individuals
[0:19:35] <Shishi1205> Lets face it, having a good online is a must nowadays
[0:19:37] <0rond> sakura is into CBT for sure
[0:19:37] <HyperMinus> @0rond Pain definitely
[0:19:45] <%gatorafan> Nah man, it works on my machine Kappa
[0:19:45] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:19:48] <%ggbhtg> LAUNCH PARTY INFINITE
[0:19:57] <+My_name_is_julio> MercyWing1 PixelBob MercyWing2
[0:20:01] <HyperMinus> and by extension Konan would be into CBT
[0:20:02] <andrex2311> THE LAUNCH PARTY NEVER ENDED!
[0:20:05] <@Solidus_113> They finally fixed the doubling audio problem, I had to deal with that every time I played online
[0:20:11] <fist_wizard_jay> Hidan loves that CBT
[0:20:13] <0rond> pain is into sounding
[0:20:14] <countgaculatv> Launch party never dies!
[0:20:21] <+TheOneCalledRock> it's sad that marvel infinite's online is better than most fighting games now a days
[0:20:22] <SSBBfan666> so, uh, anyone know whats with the constant NTR stuff regarding Ay from Naruto?
[0:20:30] <SSBBfan666> never understood it
[0:20:31] <Shishi1205> Sasori: tags tools
[0:20:34] <DemonicHoward> problem with that idea, is that most modern houses are not wired for full house eathernet support, even that iteam woolie mentioned before where you can pug into an outlet then make that an eathernet port, doesnt work for most houses because the bedrooms are on different circets
[0:20:46] <countgaculatv> @ssbbfan666 there’s so fucking much now lol
[0:20:47] <nepwar> Lee would get in CBT not realizing it was a sex thing and not a test of will thing
[0:20:49] <Klefth> Yeah, online game packets are not large. All that matters is latency and consistency
[0:20:54] <%ggbhtg> @ssbbfan666 Because BBC, SSBB
[0:20:54] <%SuperKirby24> "Enjoy netplay" LUL
[0:20:58] <%MyNameIsRasus> -guy who lost
[0:21:01] <Klefth> Download/upload speeds are almost irrelevant
[0:21:04] <nepwar> Tip: Wifi go die
[0:21:07] <+Bluydee> is there suddenly more of it now?
[0:21:08] <C4m3r0n0409> What did I miss
[0:21:11] <@Solidus_113> Last Blade 2 shoutouts
[0:21:11] <+SilverInferno3> "Real Yakuza stay wired"
[0:21:15] <andrex2311> death to wifi!
[0:21:18] <%ggbhtg> You guys need to wear that shirt every GIFG stream
[0:21:20] <Kira2993> nice

[0:21:33] <Shishi1205> Can't blame delay based whatever
[0:21:43] <C4m3r0n0409> Guess he
[0:21:45] <%MyNameIsRasus> Not that one
[0:21:50] <0rond> that scrubquotes shirt is so good... it's a good advice for those who don't know, and a public shaming for those who do
[0:22:08] <%ggbhtg> dual wield shirts
[0:22:11] <C4m3r0n0409> guess he's beating it Thursday
[0:22:12] <+ALazo> they'll still blame the lag
[0:22:14] <$SilverRoddo> Woolie still needs to make that Let It Rock! shirt.
[0:22:19] <TheAceol> Oh?
[0:22:22] <0rond> the floor is crooked man that wasn't fair
[0:22:27] <357Sneak> lytJEEZ "u weren't playing honorably"
[0:22:30] <BallerSwagBro9k> BELIEVE IT
[0:22:31] <Shishi1205> The actual quote was about hi score girls saying from a time people couldn't blame delay based netcode

[0:26:10] <SSBBfan666> Naruto, Minato, the Jinchuuriki, and also Kaguya (granted the execution was rather poor)
[0:26:10] <0rond> darui is probably has the best coolness to screen time ratio
[0:26:11] <Personified134> shikamarus whole team is good
[0:26:12] <masterfire23> they just added new dlc characters to storm 4 after 4 years. LUL
[0:26:12] <nepwar> don't forget the kaijus

[0:31:22] <C4m3r0n0409> MONEY. ON
[0:31:23] <+LandOfTheWay> you know, for a guy who says he wants eternal peace, madara really seems to enjoy fighting
[0:31:23] <+Wight_Trash> can he eat with his nipple face?
[0:31:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> WAKKA did not like that.
[0:31:25] <Iwashi94> MONEY ON
[0:31:25] <%MyNameIsRasus> TIME CUBE SHALL BE DEFEATED
[0:31:33] <Arblaster_> All according to keikaku
[0:31:36] <SSBBfan666> Madara's doing ALL this just cause he lost to Hashirama in the first place.
[0:31:37] <Ultzerostar00> He doesn't have eyes?!
[0:31:38] <Personified134> god that tit face looks awful

[0:32:08] <SSBBfan666> @Bluydee also him being able to do Rinnegan abilities when he clearly lacks the eyes
[0:32:14] <+Wight_Trash> does his nipple face have skull bones?
[0:32:15] <BallerSwagBro9k> DEFEAT SHIRTLESS MADARA

[0:33:05] <%Chatterbox1991> i am now adding ret-condom to my lexicon
[0:33:07] <%Atomik456> @SilverRoddo BRING ME BACK TO LIFE
[0:33:10] <niddron> @ggbhtg Ooh yeah with the tug of war, the anime stills weren't clear thought it was just chakra
[0:33:11] <nepwar> can't call the plan bad if you keeping adding extra setps
[0:33:12] <javis88h> Dude died and them said "Sike"
[0:33:13] <Orbeii> real fake madaras
[0:33:15] <357Sneak> u barely went in lytJEEZ lytBACKOFF FBCatch u didn't pull out
[0:33:26] <BallerSwagBro9k> He used Obito's body as a vessel
[0:33:28] <Shishi1205> Inmediatelly after
[0:33:29] <$SilverRoddo> bitterLOL
[0:33:31] <niddron> correct
[0:33:34] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> hes basically Sword saint Isshin now
[0:33:36] <+SilverInferno3> Well he died right when he left
[0:33:36] <+RockyWolf> ...
[0:33:38] <phatmac16> yes
[0:33:40] <tusk_act4> Madara died right after explaining the plan
[0:33:41] <+RockyWolf> Is this canon??
[0:33:42] <%MyNameIsRasus> Correct
[0:33:44] <TheAceol> @WoolieVersus The original intention was always to use Rinne Tensei instead of Edo Tensei on Madara
[0:33:45] <%Superbro64> Isn't edo tensei madara LITERALLY has infinite chakra?
[0:33:48] <%ggbhtg> RIGHT AFTER but the anime stills were unclear
[0:33:48] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:33:50] <0rond> the plan was always for obito to use the rinnegan to revive madara
[0:33:50] <%Reverend_Roscoe> CORRECT
[0:33:55] <%MyNameIsRasus> GOOD JOB
[0:34:02] <%rubbishbinge> Nagato was supposed to resurrect Madara
[0:34:04] <dekkitout> And his eyes don't work atm
[0:34:04] <xthomaswellertonx> and Edo real Madara is stronger than he was in life because special edo juju
[0:34:05] <EASrake> Madara pretty much died when he made Black Zetsu
[0:34:14] <+Wight_Trash> WHY DOES HE HAVE A TITTY FACE
[0:34:15] <TheAceol> FULL POWER, but no infinite chakra+regeneration
[0:34:16] <%Atomik456> i think it's like throughput, edo has infinite reserves but can't use as much?
[0:34:19] <+SilverInferno3> Edo Tensei is supposed to have some limits to the resurrected's true power, yeah?
[0:34:20] <+JustCallTre> dont talk, they're gonna show you why
[0:34:24] <Deadbulky> Edo is better but he is actually alive
[0:34:29] <+chase959> and the titties face tattoo
[0:34:30] <+Rabbitmage> Edo Tensei body is more powerful. He regenerates and has infinite chakra.
[0:34:30] <%JohnAtDawn> Edos do NOT have infinite chakra, that's common mistake.
[0:34:32] <Deadbulky> With revirth
[0:34:34] <C4m3r0n0409> Hes stronger now
[0:34:36] <+JustCallTre> they will show you why, please don't spoil anything
[0:34:36] <DemonicHoward> @WoolieVersus the game skipped a part where he used a justu to gain freedom
[0:34:36] <SSBBfan666> Edo Madara was literally unlimited so long as he wasn't sealed, he really came back just cause he wants to FEEL
[0:34:36] <0rond> the biggest issue is that edo can't be jinchuriki
[0:34:39] <niddron> he wasn't before he just got a downgrade for the lukz
[0:34:41] <Shishi1205> Kabuto didn't control him
[0:34:42] <%ggbhtg> @woolieversus yes yes
[0:34:44] <Fabric_tester> Yes
[0:34:45] <xthomaswellertonx> Normal edo yes but madara edo is specially made to be stronger
[0:34:46] <+MrTAteMyBalls> i think he's just SO STRONG that having infinite chakra from being a ghostman was a HINDRANCE
[0:34:48] <phatmac16> Yes
[0:34:48] <%ggbhtg> yes yes yes
[0:34:49] <TheAceol> @JohnAtDawn Since when? If nothing else, they have functionally infinite
[0:34:50] <%rubbishbinge> yes
[0:34:50] <tusk_act4> Yes
[0:34:51] <dareeceyboy> its the thrill of battle
[0:34:53] <fairore> yes
[0:34:54] <niddron> he downgraded himself so he could be alive
[0:34:55] <phatmac16> You’re right
[0:35:00] <+Rabbitmage> @JohnAtDawn It says in the manga explicity that there is no limit to edo tensei chakra
[0:35:03] <nepwar> that sounds like some shounen bs so its probably true
[0:35:04] <phatmac16> Kabuki downgrades him
[0:35:04] <C4m3r0n0409> He was weaker dead
[0:35:04] <+JustCallTre> They will explain why
[0:35:08] <+johnny_gogo> Kobuto Ressed Madara when he was younger and weaker
[0:35:10] <DemonicHoward> he used a justu that allowed him to gain freedom
[0:35:13] <+oscar_m510> yes but now he is using his own body unlike before when using another body with edo tensei
[0:35:13] <+JustCallTre> keep playing, they will show/explain why he needs to be alive
[0:35:15] <dareeceyboy> now he's alive, he feels pain and he fucking loves it
[0:35:15] <Arblaster_> He could not control him
[0:35:16] <0rond> wasn't there something about an edo tensei revived characters can't be jinchuriki or something?
[0:35:16] <$SilverRoddo> I want to see a 20-hit combo.
[0:35:16] <+hawk_rush> hopefully they'll explain in it -- he couldn't do what he wanted with the ten tails in edo tensei form
[0:35:18] <%jiggy_snipe> @0rond i bet thats the reason why he wants a living body
[0:35:18] <arikk42> Naruto is dumb
[0:35:19] <BallerSwagBro9k> BELIEVE IT
[0:35:24] <TheAceol> @WoolieVersus 1There's a failsafe that Tobirama put in place to negate control
[0:35:25] <+SilverInferno3> @0rond Stop spoiling
[0:35:26] <phatmac16> Kabuto couldn’t control him
[0:35:26] <sunwraith91> @WoolieVersus Madara can only use his full power when he's alive
[0:35:28] <Damie904> Madara wasnt uncontrollable. He used a jutsu to break control.
[0:35:29] <facuvillamil> he just wanted to feel alive when fighting
[0:35:30] <+toadlyy> BELIEVE IT
[0:35:33] <%Superbro64> so rinne rebirth can revive a whole village, or one person?
[0:35:35] <SSBBfan666> Kabuto resurrected and implanted the Senju flesh on him to better him.
[0:35:39] <%ggbhtg> big yes, Madara was gonna get deleted thanks to Itachi, but he said naw son @woolieversus
[0:35:40] <%lotharrio> Uchiha shenanigans protected them.
[0:35:41] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[0:35:41] <Shishi1205> Edo tensei people can be sealed
[0:35:41] <%Reverend_Roscoe> JUST WAIT
[0:35:43] <T_Sasquatch> I finished the entirety of naruto ..... Not worth it tbh
[0:35:44] <C4m3r0n0409> THEY'LL SHOW YOU
[0:35:45] <Sapphire_Breeze> IT WAS
[0:35:45] <+TheDyingPride> It gets better
[0:35:46] <tusk_act4> LUL
[0:35:46] <Shishi1205> Now he has to be killed
[0:35:47] <dekkitout> It gets worse
[0:35:48] <nepwar> imagine manga readers
[0:35:49] <Aracon_> this is literally "fuck it" territory
[0:35:51] <+MrTAteMyBalls> just WAIT until they REALLY start winging it
[0:35:51] <%SuperKirby24> LUL
[0:35:51] <niddron> no he just nerfed himself
[0:35:52] <invader_rin> You haven't seen anything yet
[0:35:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> You ain't seen nothing yet.
[0:35:53] <Deadbulky> Bi what u got comin
[0:35:53] <%Jetzord> Oh wait for it
[0:35:55] <+TheDyingPride> So much better(worse)
[0:35:55] <Ultzerostar00> lol
[0:35:56] <Fabric_tester> There's more
[0:35:57] <TheAceol> You have seen NOTHING
[0:35:57] <xthomaswellertonx> But also we have the thing of IF THE DO TOO STRONG HE CAN FLEX OUT OF YOUR CONTROLL
[0:35:57] <%jiggy_snipe> what *shocking*
[0:35:59] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Oh boy
[0:35:59] <dareeceyboy> now his senses are fully restored, minus his sight kek
[0:36:01] <Dante_Namikaze1> oh fuck how late am i?
[0:36:01] <phatmac16> Madara is now %100
[0:36:02] <+Bluydee> they explicitly state that Madara can't use the Rinnegan's full power under Edo Tensei
[0:36:07] <0rond> nagato could revive a whole village because he was an uzumaki, which has incredible life force, most people could only revive 1, life for a life
[0:36:10] <+kyh9> Oh, you better bet it was bullshit when it was serialized
[0:36:10] <dekkitout> He's blind by the way
[0:36:11] <@Solidus_113> nice stage
[0:36:14] <irfan_> oh you think THIS is winging it
[0:36:25] <C4m3r0n0409> Shouldn't he not have susano
[0:36:26] <nepwar> naruto you literally saw it happen
[0:36:26] <DemonicHoward> also he shouldnt be able to use susan
[0:36:27] <xthomaswellertonx> Madara has no eyes rn
[0:36:30] <%Th3SmartAlec> KEIKAKU DOORI
[0:36:30] <%jiggy_snipe> he doesn't have eyes right now?
[0:36:32] <+SilverInferno3> KEIKAKU
[0:36:32] <%bread_assassin> How is Madara using Susano with no Sharigan?

[0:36:40] <+MrTAteMyBalls> KEIKAKU MEANS PLAN
[0:36:40] <SSBBfan666> stupid part is Madara still can use Sharingan and Rinnegan abiities, while having NO EYES
[0:36:41] <lonlono> keikaku dori
[0:36:45] <+nairdde> why this man have 4 nipple
[0:36:47] <%rubbishbinge> He shouldn't be able to susan ;_;

[0:37:01] <+SilverInferno3> Was he able to use Susanoo in this part of the manga?
[0:37:02] <xthomaswellertonx> Madara LITERALLY got no eyes
[0:37:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> HASHIRAMA CELLS
[0:37:05] <@Solidus_113> THE CELLS
[0:37:06] <+Bluydee> they probably didn't want to make a new Madara in the game just for the brief period where he was blind
[0:37:09] <Wight_Trash> does his nipple have eyes?
[0:37:10] <gekizenbu> bitch aint even got eyes
[0:37:11] <mMayrro> HASHIRAMA CELLS??????

[0:53:08] <+Gutsandlove> FORCING
[0:53:09] <%JohnAtDawn> I love how Woolie continues to remove the ACTUAL MENTAL BREAKDOWN Sasuke had from the context of his character.
[0:53:10] <xthomaswellertonx> Minato is THE ONLY character that has food taste in women
[0:53:10] <+Gutsandlove> YOUR
[0:53:11] <lucky_icarus> Well, this is a Japanese work of fiction after all. That shit usually always has this shit.

[0:53:19] <+Gutsandlove> ME
[0:53:19] <%gunsrlove> Never get over things!
[0:53:20] <+Rabbitmage> Sasuke has been manipulated into evil. Its not his fault.
[0:53:20] <evil_doru> @WoolieVersus sakura deserves the joker no Kappa
[0:53:21] <biomegabear> @nepwar there was romance in bleach?
[0:53:22] <lonlono> bleach had awful romance

[0:53:29] <%GenesisKnight> He gets it! Woolie gets it!
[0:53:29] <%ggbhtg> We need Mark Eko no Jutsu
[0:53:30] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Getting over things is running away Kappa
[0:53:32] <Personified134> @Rabbitmage bullshit lmao
[0:53:32] <xthomaswellertonx> Neji did AND HE DIED FOR IT
[0:53:34] <+Qits> Not just stick to them, Gorilla Glue yourself to them.

[0:53:41] <HollowMan190> @justcalltre I know right

[0:53:45] <%Th3SmartAlec> @xthomaswellertonx Neji was right all along
[0:53:46] <C4m3r0n0409> LUL
[0:53:49] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> DONT GIVE UP AND HOLD ON Kappa
[0:53:50] <%ChoculaUltra> Kakashi is all about getting over it. He was so down to kill Obito lol

[0:53:54] <%ggbhtg> this is about to get real in 3....2......
[0:53:55] <phatmac16> NEVER RUN AWAY
[0:53:58] <xthomaswellertonx> Neji got over it AND DIED
[0:54:01] <nepwar> @biomegabear theres was that one time. that one time somehow is better than 90% of naruto's romance
[0:54:01] <HollowMan190> that was like 10 episodes later
[0:54:01] <C4m3r0n0409> Weve done only one mission LUL
[0:54:03] <%Livelinne> Why Shonen authors clempsGin
[0:54:07] <phatmac16> NEVER GIVE UP
[0:54:08] <dekkitout> "Never compromise, only your way matters"
[0:54:09] <Dutchpotato> TBF for Naruto at least it makes sense that he’s so obsessed to his “nakama/family” considering he was alone for so long
[0:54:11] <crossing_mao> Well, get over it is a very hard game with that swinging sledgehammer and shit
[0:54:12] <Daxalog> What is this? What happened?
[0:54:14] <hamahiroyuki> buT mY JaPAnesE HoNnoR
[0:54:14] <Zayasu> bleach had that one girl who was REALLY into aizen cirLaugh
[0:54:16] <cochramd1992> we talking about how shit Sasuke is?
[0:54:19] <+Doc1790> Neji died for the plan
[0:54:20] <sunwraith91> @WoolieVersus Actually, that's what Hashirama was speaking about.
[0:54:21] <+thesyndrome> Sasuke is a huge piece of shit, I everyone basically forgives him....
[0:54:23] <%SuperKirby24> Neji got spared Kappa
[0:54:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> Obito never gave up.
[0:54:26] <+JustCallTre> Still not as bad as Koichi's love life.
[0:54:28] <Wight_Trash> Do either naruto or sauske even know that they are in a relationship?

[0:58:06] <%nintega010> Hinata is just now ok in Boruto
[0:58:08] <+VantomPayne> the last few episodes of the anime is specifically on that, those are pretty good
[0:58:09] <CJL_13> Anko
[0:58:11] <+SilverInferno3> @Personified134 Well moreso the children and the civilians of the village
[0:58:12] <+thesyndrome> @Wight_Trash anko
[0:58:13] <cochramd1992> @fist_wizard_jay obviously she was a size queen
[0:58:13] <%MyNameIsRasus> @Wight_Trash That's Anko
[0:58:14] <%Jetzord> @Wight_Trash Anko
[0:58:14] <biomegabear> Do they do stuff with hinata we dont see in this game?
[0:58:14] <Shishi1205> Anko gets fat
[0:58:19] <foghornleghorn55> 90% of Hinata's personality is her crush on Naruto. She's only slightly better than Sakura.
[0:58:21] <nepwar> The King is the all the narutos of this godforsaken universe
[0:58:25] <%Pigg1yJuffs> Pigg1yJuffs subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! How ya doing with the quarantine so far, Woolz? Hope you're enjoying all the Naruto you've missed, cause it's going to get weird and absolutely stupid.
[0:58:30] <Sedrelic> oh..the whole hyuga family changed
[0:58:32] <%alpacasintophats> Anko is a big disappointment after this
[0:58:32] <sunwraith91> SKIP

[0:58:49] <%Th3SmartAlec> @fist_wizard_jay This feels like a throwing darts at a wall situation, where the author at least realizes he's bad at romance, so he picks random pairings.
[0:58:50] <%djazo> LUL LUL
[0:58:50] <+hawk_rush> shikamaru's probably the one who got affected by Naruto the least

[0:58:58] <+TheDyingPride> We got to that forever ago
[0:58:58] <helidzz> This is my main gripe with the show, it's that every character becomes Naruto eventually.
[0:58:58] <+SilverInferno3> Woolie...
[0:58:59] <+Bluydee> it literally did
[0:59:00] <Shishi1205> Asuma said who the king was
[0:59:00] <jbees7> what about shino, shino grows
[0:59:00] <T_Sasquatch> @foghornleghorn55 she's the only person that attempts to stop pain from crucificing Naruto
[0:59:02] <sunwraith91> The king is the future
[0:59:03] <biomegabear> Shikamaru just was consistant on brand
[0:59:04] <Shishi1205> ITS DA KIDS
[0:59:04] <Orbeii> tenten is king
[0:59:05] <%rubbishbinge> Shikamaru improved to make up for all of Naruto's flaws
[0:59:06] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus the king is literally nothing, it was just an empty metaphor
[0:59:07] <+LandOfTheWay> Shikamaru, Temari, Hinata, Gaara, Rock Lee, and Might Guy are the real MVPs
[0:59:08] <DemonicHoward> @WoolieVersus They answered the king when asuma died
[0:59:08] <%Ashenik1> In the last Naruto movie Hinata is actualy prettt cool character
[0:59:08] <+GreenCMD> the king is the next gen

[1:48:59] <+SleepingPliskin> YES
[1:48:59] <+GreenCMD> NAAAH
[1:49:00] <42nfl19> Did Woolie notice the eyes?
[1:49:00] <arikk42> delete the game
[1:49:02] <InfiniteSwagbito> The true true of what happened is even better
[1:49:02] <Zayasu> game is better
[1:49:02] <dekkitout> No anime time, this was better
[1:49:03] <Shishi1205> Game was good
[1:49:04] <bearwagon> its better in the game
[1:49:07] <%jiggy_snipe> that was the only cool thing in the Madara fight
[1:49:07] <+Bluydee> nah the game is better this time
[1:49:08] <biomegabear> @42nfl19 no
[1:49:10] <Afrobrawler> No don't watch it
[1:49:10] <Blank9> someone let woolie know Ninjala's developed by the same people who made Teppen
[1:49:11] <+DarkNerdShawny> game was better
[1:49:11] <+OddityOn> The anime version was worse
[1:49:11] <Lildmarsh24> Game did it best
[1:49:12] <%rubbishbinge> Anime Night Guy is flaccid
[1:49:13] <laguerrilha> I prefer this version than the anime
[1:49:13] <Deadbulky> Game better
[1:49:13] <+PenGia> The game actually does it better
[1:49:15] <%alpacasintophats> feth ninjala we gotta finish this shit
[1:49:15] <%funny_valintine> best fight
[1:49:16] <+GreenCMD> THERE IS WAY MORE IMPORTANT stuff to watch
[1:49:16] <InfiniteSwagbito> This was better but the anime has some details
[1:49:17] <C4m3r0n0409> The kick is better in the game
[1:49:17] <%optimasmaximas> dialogue is better in the anime
[1:49:18] <%Th3SmartAlec> HE KICKED THE TREE
[1:49:21] <T_Sasquatch> Madara literally gets blown apart in HALF
[1:49:21] <fangovafang> Thee best
[1:49:22] <fruit_pie_the_magician> game was NOT better
[1:49:24] <TheAceol> He kicked that tree REAL GOOD
[1:49:24] <+Bluydee> manga > game > anime
[1:49:24] <masterfire23> night guy is such a cool transformation and its really cool gameplay concept
[1:49:25] <%Sparkseid> Game ver. did it flashier
[1:49:26] <BearSawed> favorite moment in this mediocre show
[1:49:27] <%KnivesEve> ah i just missed might guy!?
[1:49:27] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus this fight is way better in game, but the Anime has a little more detail in what happens.
[1:49:27] <+MrTurtleThief> FUCK HARD
[1:49:28] <+thesyndrome> games visuals were better, but dialogue was better in the show
[1:49:29] <rosemon5001> i mean it was pretty accurate only maybe a flashback to his teacher was cut in the game @WoolieVersus
[1:49:31] <%Th3SmartAlec> WOOLIE NAILED IT
[1:49:32] <NickHatesSnow> The only part of the anime that's better is madara
[1:49:35] <%Solidnick18> Fuck yeah
[1:49:41] <Picosunloaded> bends reality
[1:49:41] <%Ashenik1> Madara reactions are better in anime
[1:49:42] <%jiggy_snipe> I love how Madara was actually scared
[1:49:42] <InfiniteSwagbito> @WoolieVersus Madara gets most of his torso exploded from the kick, you don't see it in the game
[1:49:43] <D3rrtyD4n> damn i dont remember the fight being that bad
[1:49:46] <%lotharrio> Early on, Kakashi opened up his second gate because he was running late with Sasuke. Never touched on again.
[1:49:47] <+hawk_rush> min-maxing crazy
[1:49:48] <%emperordread> Lee and Guy were my favourites
[1:49:50] <+SilverInferno3> FITTYFIVE
[1:49:50] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> All downhill from here Woolz
[1:49:51] <+SleepingPliskin> also the fucking rib crushing
[1:49:53] <%jiggy_snipe> reminds of Cell and Vegeta's Big Bang
[1:49:54] <kevonthelordofslimes> TRULY MIN-MAXED
[1:49:58] <T_Sasquatch> Madara LITERALLY says he would've died
[1:50:00] <C4m3r0n0409> No more Naruto nooo
[1:50:01] <dekkitout> Also, Guy had to do that because only Taijutst and Senjutsu hurt Mad Lad Madara
[1:50:02] <Jetsfantasy> Madara gives Guy the ultimate respect from this move
[1:50:04] <%alpacasintophats> min maxed into CQC
[1:50:06] <HollowMan190> it's all downhill from here
[1:50:07] <+OddityOn> The anime did not do this fight justice
[1:50:11] <%jinking79> No Guy's dad moment
[1:50:11] <+SleepingPliskin> yall don't fucking understand BONE CRUSHING BODY FUCKED
[1:50:13] <helidzz> See you thursday
[1:50:14] <biomegabear> are we watching anime
[1:50:14] <D3rrtyD4n> everyone saying the anime version is trash 🤷
[1:50:14] <Deadbulky> It all comes tumbling down
[1:50:15] <+hithereguy2> Might guy rolled a bat 55
[1:50:16] <Shishi1205> HACHIMON TONKO
[1:50:17] <Malik1002> spolierd
[1:50:17] <nepwar> time for more ninjas
[1:50:17] <%Th3SmartAlec> @lotharrio because the idea of their being a power that anyone could have in the Naruto world is scary to the writer I guess
[1:50:18] <C4m3r0n0409> Anime fight was slow and boring
[1:50:20] <%JetpackMcQuack> What a story
[1:50:21] <@Solidus_113> @WoolieVersus what the game didn't show, is that all those kicks and hits in-game broke all of Guy's fucking BONES
[1:50:22] <Zayasu> @WoolieVersus this fight is better in the game than in the anime
[1:50:26] <42nfl19> @WoolieVersus Did you notice anything strange about naruto?
[1:50:28] <ghoulspan> yo Mihn is OUT
[1:50:29] <+JustToWatch> If Naruto wasn't the protagonist the fight would've ended here
[1:50:30] <yabois3rg> welp
[1:50:30] <+zanzibar_junker> good work guys
[1:50:32] <T_Sasquatch> I liked the anime fight more thh
[1:50:32] <laguerrilha> Good place to stop
[1:50:36] <Lysdexic9541> Dammit. I missed everything
[1:50:37] <+thesyndrome> @Solidus_113 they also broke madaras
[1:50:37] <%Ashenik1> Isnt the last fight in this game better than in the anime ?
[1:50:38] <biomegabear> Its cool that the game did it better than the anime
[1:50:39] <dekkitout> @Solidus_113 Bones dustified
[1:50:41] <rosemon5001> @OddityOn point on point what you mean
[1:50:42] <nepwar> it also didn't mention what the red aura was

[2:08:57] <YakumoYomi> The animated short was better than I was expecting.

[2:30:34] <TopTierHarley> no can't do anything
[2:30:40] <laguerrilha> yeah
[2:30:41] <crossing_mao> @ggbhtg Good discipline
[2:30:43] <$arcielardor> two bars
[2:30:44] <%Th3SmartAlec> UNIQUE
[2:30:48] <Junkles> because there's 8 different controller configurations
[2:30:49] <%ggbhtg> ooooh noooo back to the LAB AGAIN
[2:30:50] <eggsamillionTB> It's because of the use of joycons
[2:30:51] <skewerstar> Oh, didn't know GungHo worked on this!
[2:30:51] <DMatts142> its so synch your controller
[2:30:53] <laguerrilha> Make so "press any button"
[2:30:54] <Metrome91> Game combat feels too slow.
[2:30:54] <DMatts142> to*
[2:30:54] <+Grayhammatter> they've got another session later tonight
[2:30:55] <+Dr_DangerPhD> They probably do that so you don't use one joycon
[2:31:00] <+OddityOn> At least I have faith in the customization though they feel good
[2:31:01] <%Sparkseid> locked out
[2:31:01] <%ggbhtg> not again! back to the LAG AGAIN
[2:31:08] <+xGreenflame> It's a Splatoon thing and this is a Splatoon
[2:31:09] <Aracon_> good beta guys LUL
[2:31:11] <C4m3r0n0409> believe it
[2:31:13] <Saltmeisterr> it made sense in splatoon cuz u need both zr and zl to play the game
[2:31:16] <TopTierHarley> it's not about the 2nd session tonight it's about this first session not happening
[2:31:16] <Metrome91> They gotta speed up the combat and reduce hit stun.
[2:31:20] <%Reverend_Roscoe> GROSS?
[2:31:25] <%ggbhtg> We messed up back to the LAB AGAIN
[2:31:26] <laguerrilha> you use more fingers
[2:31:29] <%SuperKirby24> share ninjas chat LUL
[2:31:30] <%Rhinoprotoss> Some boomer complaints
[2:31:30] <+louiswho> the plus button on joycons are so damn tiny
[2:31:31] <%BisoromiBear> SRK to start the game
[2:31:33] <laguerrilha> more fingers more effort
[2:31:33] <%AlcoholicBlackGuy> if i got it in my pocket it presses the start button
[2:31:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> Get rekt
[2:31:36] <+OddityOn> Lol
[2:31:36] <C4m3r0n0409> LUL
[2:31:37] <%FuqBoiSlim> UH OHHH BAXK TO LAB AGAIN
[2:31:37] <%Reverend_Roscoe> BLOWN UP
[2:31:37] <NiktenKing> Then why would you play a game that requires coordination
[2:31:38] <crossing_mao> Great beta gaes
[2:31:40] <%Reverend_Roscoe> GET FUCKED
[2:31:42] <irfan_> MINH GAMES
[2:31:42] <%AlcoholicBlackGuy> plus button should be start
[2:31:43] <BlacSoul> Credit to Dmatts142, To synch Joycons
[2:31:43] <nepwar> make it the same. it is inconvenient to do two
[2:31:46] <+Psycosis> What about some Super Mario Maker 2?
[2:31:47] <Junkles> it's 100% because of joycons
[2:31:49] <%rubbishbinge> this must be one of those first world problems
[2:31:49] <%Wool> it's to sync
[2:31:54] <MattDemers> hrm, Gung Ho reminds me of a terrible mobile developer
[2:32:01] <laguerrilha> any button is the best one
[2:32:06] <BackwardCap> Fail Safe
[2:32:07] <+deemellow> Salt Party Invisigun Heroes tho? 👀
[2:32:09] <hilario_md> it's to recognize which joycons you're using
[2:32:09] <+louiswho> I have grips on my joycons and can barely touch the plus minus
[2:32:11] <%JetpackMcQuack> Its so they know what your controller configuration is
[2:32:17] <Junkles> wii u no have joycon
[2:32:17] <%fetrigon> @mattdemers is it MiHoYo?
[2:32:22] <Fabric_tester> It's to make sure the most important buttons work
[2:32:23] <eggsamillionTB> Oh yeah, some Wii games had you press A+B
[2:32:27] <%legacy0117> It might be something Nintendo is doing to make itself appear unique to competitor consoles, remember what the newest system Nintendo is releasing looks like.
[2:32:28] <Saltmeisterr> splatoon
[2:32:31] <+TheOneCalledRock> splatoon
[2:32:35] <Shishi1205> Yeah A+B was common in Wii
[2:32:35] <%SuperKirby24> iirc I think splatoon 1 and mk8
[2:32:38] <C4m3r0n0409> Wii sports had A+B
[2:32:44] <Junkles> hmmmm, Nintendo gonna tendo
[2:32:49] <%FuqBoiSlim> It was Mario kart 8 right?
[2:32:51] <skewerstar> GungHo worked on Teppen, dunno what else they worked on tho...
[2:32:54] <DizzyChicks123> @junkles this isn't Nintendo
[2:32:57] <darkocore> What is happening?
[2:32:59] <fairore> welp
[2:33:01] <laguerrilha> This is REALLY heavy "inspired" by Splatoon
[2:33:04] <%FuqBoiSlim> Didnt breath of the wild have you press something weird too?
[2:33:05] <%KnivesEve> do it harder
[2:33:07] <NiktenKing> Because your fingers aren't on the plus buttons when you hold a controller
[2:33:08] <DizzyChicks123> gungho created puzzles and dragons
[2:33:09] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:33:10] <+MetalPanic> A+B makes sense to ensure the casual base has their hands on the most important buttons
[2:33:11] <eggsamillionTB> @laguerrilha fr
[2:33:14] <%BisoromiBear> Minh is one guy
[2:33:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> This is a hill, isn't it?

[2:33:35] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> PRESS L1 + B WHILE HOLDING R3
[2:33:35] <SomersaultJustice> it's just a launcher command Kappa
[2:33:37] <%Wool> It's the Share Button talk all over again
[2:33:42] <nepwar> i don't understand when is there a situation i accidentally hit start and its a huge problem
[2:33:43] <%Prevot> "complexity"
[2:33:43] <thewizardpenguin1> :/
[2:33:43] <Fabric_tester> Check your shoot and aim buttons
[2:33:45] <C4m3r0n0409> MINH
[2:33:45] <%FuqBoiSlim> @fairore ah alright
[2:33:46] <+Hoshidan> GungHo also had Ragnarok Online according to my research
[2:33:56] <%Th3SmartAlec> ...
[2:33:56] <justfourprimes> The triggers are way easier to press by accident
[2:34:02] <LilacKing> The triggers feel nicer to press
[2:34:02] <laguerrilha> Acidental entering the menu??? how would that be a problem?
[2:34:04] <%ggbhtg> DO IT ONE WAY AND STICK TO IT, Japanese HONORRRR
[2:34:05] <%AlcoholicBlackGuy> FACTS
[2:34:08] <Saltmeisterr> they are getting really heated over this LUL
[2:34:09] <Junkles> good point woolie
[2:34:09] <YakumoYomi> I put a lot of time into Ragnarok Odyssey Ace on PS3
[2:34:10] <+DizzmanLive> There is almost like a standard for controler configs so anything thats difference just feels gross
[2:34:10] <justfourprimes> no one is going to hit the plus by accident
[2:34:13] <%nothuzad> Hoshidan maybe in japan - but RO is Gravity
[2:34:14] <+Taglog7> Whadayah buyin?
[2:34:14] <@Solidus_113> https://twitter.com/playninjala/status/1255219172512063497 https://twitter.com/playninjala/status/1255219172512063497 https://twitter.com/playninjala/status/1255219172512063497
[2:34:15] <powerprotoman> it shouldnt be but people are stupid reggie, take for instance this argument
[2:34:16] <%Struggleful> Make people do a 4 hit combo to start fighting games
[2:34:16] <nepwar> Facts & Logic LUL
[2:34:16] <NickHatesSnow> LUL
[2:34:17] <%jiggy_snipe> exactly Woolie
[2:34:18] <justfourprimes> the plus is a way stiffer press
[2:34:18] <%Prevot> BOTH shoulder buttons at the same time?
[2:34:18] <%FuqBoiSlim> It's just two buttons man
[2:34:22] <justfourprimes> heres the thing
[2:34:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> flat ass
[2:34:25] <+TheDyingPride> I mean before that, you gotta press Home to wake the console, then press the same button thrice
[2:34:29] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @Petiole_
[2:34:29] <%nothuzad> YakumoYomi while certainly budget in some ways I had a bunch of fun with that game
[2:34:29] <+FridayStreamer> I thought pressing both buttons on the joycon was so you know they're both for player 1?
[2:34:29] <C4m3r0n0409> THIS ARGUMENT IS DONE
[2:34:30] <%ggbhtg> DO IT ONE WAY AND STICK TO IT, Japanese HONORRR
[2:34:31] <justfourprimes> you gain and loose nothing either way
[2:34:33] <+xGreenflame> John Con
[2:34:34] <NiktenKing> Press the ANY button, Woolie
[2:34:34] <BlackOrchidKI> I don't really care either way. It starts the game.

[2:35:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> He said the thing!
[2:35:59] <+megamanx74> It's a choice that they made might be on a personal level but we can really call the shots because we did not make the game. Overall, we need to ask the source if we really want the answer.
[2:36:00] <C4m3r0n0409> Woolie is wrong

[2:36:33] <Saltmeisterr> ok but how is the actual game?
[2:36:42] <+hawk_rush> LUL
[2:36:43] <%arkv01> @SuperKirby24 bot this is going to leave a shit taste in a lot of potential players' mouths...
[2:36:44] <NiktenKing> But... why would you default use PS4 controller on PC when using it for PS4
[2:36:46] <%FuqBoiSlim> @saltmeisterr no one knows LUL
[2:36:49] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> "We're not getting into it. Here's my argument btw."

[2:37:06] <Metrome91> @Saltmeisterr Game combat feels slow. They gotta speed up the game and reduce hitstun just a bit
[2:37:10] <%legacy0117> So, that was a really brief look at cfc this game if it's all online.

[2:55:06] <%TheFabledAble> @WoolieVersus You know I think the reason you only like controllers for games is cause for the longest time you only used keyboard and mouse for work. so now your brain assosiates keyboard with typing and not wasd controls.

[3:04:16] <%Reverend_Roscoe> @WoolieVersus HE'S THAT LAST BEAST
[3:04:22] <%Exiliator> He was Might, and he took it one step further, from M to N Kappa
[3:04:23] <Shishi1205> Because he goes night night
[3:04:23] <Picosunloaded> @WoolieVersus also he punches so hard he bends reality
[3:04:28] <ravenrooke> Morning Peacock, Afternoon Tiger, Night Guy
[3:04:28] <0rond> the morning peacock, afternoon tiger, night guy

[3:05:31] <nepwar> green naruto what a surprise
[3:05:34] <+SilverInferno3> Horikoshi loves Naruto
[3:05:34] <Shishi1205> Endevour vs nomu
[3:05:37] <%Visorak6> stolen powers can always be trumped by one honed and intimately understood one
[3:05:39] <+CarlosEoM> AFO vs OFA
[3:05:39] <+Grayhammatter> green naruto
[3:05:50] <%arkv01> DER THING
[3:05:50] <Amardeux> Do we though?
[3:05:51] <WanderingSwordsman> Night Guy is to signify that he becomes the Beast
[3:05:52] <Amardeux> LUL
[3:05:54] <dan_g_v> you mean green gon
[3:05:54] <+kyh9> Stealing super powers vs getting super powers given to you
[3:05:54] <blue6sub6remnant6> Are we talking manga spoilers or anime spoilers in MHA?
[3:05:55] <%ggbhtg> subete yooo

[3:06:07] <%ggbhtg> animw
[3:06:08] <+SilverInferno3> @blue6sub6remnant6 I mean probably just S3 of the anime
[3:06:10] <phatmac16> anime
[3:06:16] <@Solidus_113> support the official release
[3:06:16] <nepwar> @blue6sub6remnant6 neither. woolie hasn't caught up

[3:06:31] <%ggbhtg> EVERYDAY I'M ANIME
[3:06:31] <Amardeux> isnt a manga also an official release technically?
[3:06:32] <%GrassCannon> Woolie confirmed pleb taste
[3:06:32] <%Exiliator> or buy a shirt
[3:06:33] <BlacSoul> how far is 20 behind?
[3:06:33] <Shishi1205> You can read it first then rewatch it
[3:06:36] <Kira2993> you dont pay my sub Kappa
[3:06:36] <laguerrilha> But the live chat is so funny BibleThump
[3:06:37] <+SilverInferno3> But what about the abridged series 🤔
[3:06:38] <%ggbhtg> EVERYDAY I'M anime
[3:06:39] <Amardeux> this analogy kinda falls apart
[3:06:39] <BlackOrchidKI> But muh chat reactions
[3:06:39] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @phatmac16
[3:06:41] <Shishi1205> Check the comments and laugh
[3:06:41] <+TheDyingPride> I read the LN and throw the anime on in the background when I'm doing other stuff
[3:06:42] <RajelSkoven> Has the salt bled into RL?
[3:06:42] <+hawk_rush> I can't wait TFS to do an abridged seriese Kappa
[3:06:46] <dan_g_v> manga cant even swim

[3:07:26] <dan_g_v> make a. white woolid
[3:07:27] <legacyofsol> My favorite VO fact is the connection between Code Geass and Persona 4. Susaku voices Yosuke, Lelouche voices Adachi (which makes the final scenes more epic). Also in P4Arena, it's ironic that Yu's voice is taken over by Adachi.
[3:07:29] <%jiggy_snipe> Minh should try to play too
[3:07:33] <+hawk_rush> more time on the clock

[3:35:59] <Shishi1205> Wow garbage settings
[3:36:09] <kesler031> so an hour and a half? i take it was mostly character customizing... ill just check the vod later for the first part.
[3:36:10] <$silentblast93> im digging the music though
[3:36:37] <laguerrilha> there is a button left, they should make it the change target
[3:36:38] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:36:42] <TigerClaws12> control customization in a console game? It really is 2020
[3:36:47] <BackwardCap> Looks like the entire ost is already in, hope someone dumps it.
[3:36:51] <%FuqBoiSlim> Nintendo games and garbage settings. name a more iconic duo
[3:36:51] <%ggbhtg> Dmc, Kingdom Hearts....
[3:36:59] <nepwar> it looks like the game is meant to be played without a hard lock @WoolieVersus
[3:37:01] <%Struggleful> @kesler031 Couldn't play the game for most of that time
[3:37:02] <%Chichen> @WoolieVersus I think the lock on system is set up this way to balance PVP
[3:37:04] <%ggbhtg> games with sense...
[3:37:07] <kilexeyXd> anyone getting error #G-0--001 ?
[3:37:10] <%lazuli_alter> @FuqBoiSlim this isn't Nintendo, this is GungHo
[3:37:11] <laguerrilha> cycling between multiple enemies attacking you at the same time is important
[3:37:12] <TigerClaws12> this is pretty much Dissidia
[3:37:18] <%ChoculaUltra> @kesler031 well the game's servers went down for about 15- 20 minutes and before that was Woolie and Minh just trying to get into the game for another 15 minutes.
[3:37:21] <%xpakeo> i am @kilexeyXd
[3:37:23] <Joy_v0> I'm getting a lot of error too :c
[3:37:24] <gustavozxd> is game good?

[3:37:36] <%FuqBoiSlim> @lazuli_alter tru

[3:39:06] <+TheOneCalledRock> yeah servers are down again
[3:39:09] <+Taglog7> Ninjala is just Gummy Bears but with ninjas
[3:39:18] <BackwardCap> rip
[3:39:21] <+Grayhammatter> oh WHAT?
[3:39:22] <+NYCrownlessKing> dont leave trainintg
[3:39:24] <laguerrilha> So you can upgrade you weapon so you pole/ball/drill head gets bigger Kappa
[3:39:25] <+TheDyingPride> They probably got all the data they needed this time
[3:39:28] <Solid_as_a_brock> Server times message is back.
[3:39:31] <Enderou> this that new splatoon?
[3:39:32] <gustavozxd> not a good time for this with everyone in quarantine
[3:39:37] <Zayasu> @WoolieVersus dont quit training
[3:39:42] <NiktenKing> You can make gum missiles, gatling, net traps...
[3:39:50] <%FuqBoiSlim> so its confirmed the yoyo is the best weapon in the game right?
[3:39:51] <BlacSoul> DO NOT QUIT ITS BACK DOWN
[3:39:51] <NiktenKing> Hopefully more weapons at launch
[3:40:02] <%lazuli_alter> @WoolieVersus Don't quit training, servers are back down
[3:40:03] <+OddityOn> DO NOT QUIT
[3:40:04] <%Struggleful> Never leaving training is how I play fighting games
[3:40:12] <%Th3SmartAlec> JESUS
[3:40:13] <$silentblast93> so this beta was only for 1 fucking hour?
[3:40:13] <%SuperKirby24> get quarrantined in training mode LUL
[3:40:19] <%FuqBoiSlim> I'm sure you get more weapons by leveling up like in splatoon
[3:40:20] <+OddityOn> EARLY TRAINING ARC
[3:40:24] <%ChoculaUltra> whoa wait, there's fighting games that aren't played in the lab?! heresy.
[3:40:25] <gustavozxd> <- training mode only player
[3:40:37] <+Grayhammatter> that's an insane special
[3:41:00] <+OddityOn> Oh that's awesome
[3:41:10] <InfiniteSwagbito> stage design definitely stronger than strikers
[3:41:11] <+DoctorAvens> i wonder how big the team sizes are
[3:41:16] <+TheDyingPride> How does it control when wallrunning? Well?
[3:41:21] <gustavozxd> this really is the shinobi strikers of videogames
[3:41:25] <+Infernal_Dalek> Perform the Chaos Dunk
[3:41:33] <jazzygrooves> the goddess herself PogChamp
[3:41:34] <%FuqBoiSlim> I think team matches are 5v5
[3:41:35] <+ConLin_Arts_> so, is this good?
[3:41:38] <%legacy0117> Severs down again? Well, at least we get to see all you can do, and not just be stuck in a box. ^^
[3:41:38] <nepwar> goddess please sit on my face
[3:41:42] <InfiniteSwagbito> You can't reach the statue of liberty, she's using AT Fields
[3:41:46] <+TheDyingPride> Yes
[3:41:50] <gustavozxd> did woolie even play a match yet?
[3:41:52] <+TheDyingPride> You get 1 back
[3:41:52] <laguerrilha> Wish more anime would make the Statue of Liberty a mech. Like Space Dandy
[3:41:59] <Kira2993> isn't it too big for 8 players?
[3:41:59] <Amardeux> the Apples increases your max gum it looks like
[3:42:03] <+xGreenflame> @WoolieVersus Hold the stick back and press attack
[3:42:12] <Saltmeisterr> gyro aiming is actually tight
[3:42:13] <%lazuli_alter> Red Drones increase your max S-Energy capacity @WoolieVersus
[3:42:27] <+Taglog7> I'm wall Walkin Ova here!
[3:42:36] <anobanano1> I can't enter the game
[3:42:42] <Bigfatnoodle> Is there a button for resetting the camera when using gyro? I couldn't find it before the server shut down again
[3:42:46] <+OddityOn> Our GMOD prop hunt shit
[3:42:53] <laguerrilha> this seems a better better suited for 16-20 playres
[3:43:01] <Saltmeisterr> i wonder if its the y button
[3:43:06] <+Grayhammatter> oh...
[3:43:09] <gustavozxd> 4d chess
[3:43:11] <kingdomfan0> wait how is he in?
[3:43:13] <+Taglog7> cannot fool our AI overlords
[3:43:17] <%ggbhtg> the mixup
[3:43:19] <+Grayhammatter> nope?
[3:43:19] <+TheOneCalledRock> wow gungho servers devs are working over time
[3:43:21] <Amardeux> Woolie is finally playing Prop Hunt LUL
[3:43:22] <+TheOneCalledRock> LUL
[3:43:23] <laguerrilha> good trap
[3:43:24] <anobanano1> @bigfatnoodle the button of the left stick resets the camera
[3:43:25] <+TheDyingPride> Can you tell the AI to do it?
[3:43:32] <Bigfatnoodle> thanks @anobanano1
[3:43:33] <NiktenKing> Henshin meter
[3:43:40] <NiktenKing> or henge
[3:43:41] <%legacy0117> Prop hunt + Splatoon? That is a clever idea they came up with.
[3:43:41] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:43:44] <sushipanda666> I don’t want play :(
[3:43:58] <%FuqBoiSlim> server devs getting worked more than naughty dog devs BibleThump pray for em
[3:44:06] <sushipanda666> I have the switch just the game as bugged rip :(
[3:44:07] <+OddityOn> LMAO why is Prop Hunt in my Melee Splatoon
[3:44:10] <+xGreenflame> There's directional stick inputs for attacks
[3:44:13] <gekizenbu> is this woolie's ninja way
[3:44:17] <gustavozxd> I don't think this is anything like splatoon
[3:44:21] <+Taglog7> LUL BibleThump
[3:44:32] <laguerrilha> its probably better for team fight mode
[3:44:33] <+shry2049> honey, it's 3pm est, time for your daily server down
[3:44:33] <NekoZen> really good for a Capture The Flag mode
[3:44:37] <NiktenKing> The skill cards have benefits that are more suited towards transforming, but they aren't really unlockable/upgradeable in the beta
[3:44:39] <NekoZen> hide and camp the flag
[3:44:39] <gustavozxd> other than the art style I guess
[3:44:44] <%SuperKirby24> need to unga bunga to win Kappa
[3:44:47] <BackwardCap> Hiding gives time to recover health without being ganked
[3:44:51] <@Solidus_113> Prop Hunt...
[3:44:53] <TopTierHarley> don't forget to continue to dash by swinging your weapon in the air
[3:45:06] <shinmaster47> neccalii
[3:45:07] <+Dreadlord134> Hide to regain life
[3:45:13] <LilacKing> Its probably for ambush
[3:45:17] <nepwar> works for 1v1
[3:45:53] <NiktenKing> 4v4
[3:45:56] <TopTierHarley> don't forget you get your double jump back after a wall cling @WoolieVersus
[3:45:58] <%Wool> still down
[3:45:58] <Iwashi94> maybe they'll have a prop hunt mode? lol
[3:46:04] <lightgianma> they twitted again. VoHiYo
[3:46:10] <$silentblast93> ther only had the beta for a hour
[3:46:11] <+TheOneCalledRock> twitter says maintenance
[3:46:21] <gustavozxd> oh...
[3:46:23] <Shishi1205> Yo dunks?
[3:46:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> This is like in Dokapon when Woolie was looking for the Lost Tech
[3:46:29] <laguerrilha> i wonder if they will make bigger lobbys. this map is too big for less than 16-20 players
[3:46:36] <%lazuli_alter> Another server maintenance
[3:46:40] <Saltmeisterr> oh so like kid icarus uprising?
[3:46:42] <Amardeux> CHAOS DUNK
[3:46:44] <+SaltyGhostRock> Chaos Dunk PogChamp
[3:46:46] <%lazuli_alter> At least it's happening now than on Launch?
[3:46:47] <MayorRev> CHAOS DUNK
[3:46:48] <+xGreenflame> Left/Right are also different
[3:46:49] <%legacy0117> If so, it'll be amazing shift from being thrown together with random teams.
[3:46:50] <+Grayhammatter> that's the RPS
[3:46:50] <NiktenKing> It also acts as a zone tool
[3:46:51] <%lazuli_alter> YOO CHAOS DUNK
[3:46:52] <Iwashi94> and the dunk leaves the ball as a projectile
[3:46:56] <NiktenKing> the ball will stay in place
[3:46:56] <gustavozxd> I don't think the map is too big
[3:47:01] <%Weeewer> is woolie enjoying this chat?
[3:47:04] <Amardeux> Here i gooooo
[3:47:06] <%SuperKirby24> @Saltmeisterr yeahh I get serious KIU vibes from the combat in this game
[3:47:08] <%fetrigon> THIS GAME IS SICK
[3:47:12] <gustavozxd> this is a game where you're supposed to hide, with more than 10 players that's pretty much impossible
[3:47:22] <TopTierHarley> @WoolieVersus hang on the side of a building and transform
[3:47:30] <+Taglog7> Who da pretty lady on the poster? Kreygasm
[3:47:32] <Saltmeisterr> ok i am now way more interested in this game

[3:48:27] <%legacy0117> Hope they mix up object pieces to mess with people. ^^
[3:48:28] <TopTierHarley> robo shy guy

[3:49:24] <%FuqBoiSlim> can you do your super while the ball is out?
[3:49:25] <%ggbhtg> Seto Kaiba
[3:49:27] <gustavozxd> this game seems to have some cool mechanics
[3:49:31] <LilacKing> You could use the camouflage around the red bots and ambush
[3:49:37] <NiktenKing> Zone tool for the drones
[3:49:38] <%SuperKirby24> So its pretty much yoyona from hyperfight Kappa
[3:49:58] <TopTierHarley> damn I should have staye din training
[3:50:04] <TopTierHarley> tried to change my weapon
[3:50:06] <Amardeux> Woolie number 1 in Evo for Ninjala
[3:50:18] <Shishi1205> Thors 1
[3:50:19] <Amardeux> Kappa
[3:50:33] <gustavozxd> are the weapons character specific?
[3:50:35] <%ggbhtg> can you do super while it's set? @woolieversus
[3:50:41] <laguerrilha> basketball weapon and bomb super seems way too good compared to the rest
[3:50:42] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1255023082869272576
[3:50:43] <%ggbhtg> they are not
[3:50:44] <Kokiri_Bomber> I feel like the movement speeds need to be increased a little bit
[3:50:48] <blaze8423> @gustavozxd no
[3:50:53] <+TheOneCalledRock> LUL
[3:50:56] <+Grayhammatter> wow LUL
[3:50:59] <%Exiliator> Woolies character already looks a bit like cioccolata Kappa Just climb up high and youll win
[3:51:05] <BackwardCap> COME MJOLNIR
[3:51:05] <%ggbhtg> that's OD
[3:51:46] <%ggbhtg> can you do super while it's set? @woolieversus
[3:51:49] <Cableprt> try doing it out of dash
[3:51:59] <gustavozxd> wtf you guys trying to do LUL
[3:52:00] <+TheOneCalledRock> i don't think you can
[3:52:12] <+trippersigs22> how are you playing?
[3:52:15] <%FuqBoiSlim> trying to find Easter eggs LUL
[3:52:15] <jazzygrooves> @gustavozxd trying to dunk the ball into the hoop LUL
[3:52:38] <%FuqBoiSlim> can you do your specials while the ball is round tripping? @woolieversus
[3:52:38] <%Weeewer> Oh thats a fun block mechanic
[3:52:45] <kingdomfan0> how do you play while severs are down?
[3:52:56] <gustavozxd> damn you can set up and bring it back and hit the guy that's strong
[3:53:03] <+Grayhammatter> he's in training
[3:53:20] <gustavozxd> BONK
[3:53:24] <kingdomfan0> yeah but is won't even let me in
[3:53:26] <%Wool> bruh that hammer does so much damage
[3:53:28] <LittleWulfie> Isn't there a specific attack against blocks?
[3:53:36] <stormydaysz> no it pops on you if you get hit by the guard break
[3:53:52] <+galdino_93> If he changes weapon, can he enter training again?
[3:53:52] <LittleWulfie> oh yes guard break
[3:53:53] <jazzygrooves> @kingdomfan0 he was in training before servers went down, it'll kick him out if he leaves training now
[3:54:08] <kingdomfan0> ahh I see
[3:54:35] <Shishi1205> So the dunk would be a guard attack?
[3:54:40] <madgerofl> Why do you still have access when the beta is closed ?
[3:54:40] <+TheOneCalledRock> wow they really put time into this
[3:54:41] <%lazuli_alter> weapon break?
[3:54:43] <%lazuli_alter> yoo
[3:54:44] <+TheOneCalledRock> this has meta
[3:55:01] <gustavozxd> tactical nuke incoming
[3:55:03] <Ekana_Stone> Is there 1v1 ?
[3:55:04] <laguerrilha> that bomb is going to get nerfed for sure
[3:55:09] <%FuqBoiSlim> gomu gomu no nuke
[3:55:13] <kirattar> How are you playing the game
[3:55:18] <%legacy0117> This unfortunately feels slow, but this map will have 10 people running around in it. This will probably have some faster weapons than others.
[3:55:26] <%lazuli_alter> they got into training mode before servers went down again
[3:55:30] <nepwar> doesnt look like break does dmg but it fucks your weapon
[3:55:32] <stormydaysz> can break get into rps?
[3:55:32] <@Solidus_113> use break attack after the 3rd hit of a regular combo, or when you knock them away
[3:55:32] <+DrTribal> how is woolie playing ninjala rn
[3:55:39] <%legacy0117> The basketball is probably slow.
[3:55:44] <laguerrilha> yeah, move speed need to be tunned up a little
[3:55:45] <%Exiliator> Your characters resolve is being tested in the lower left corner LUL
[3:55:50] <%FuqBoiSlim> hes in training mode. if he leaves he'll get kicked out
[3:56:03] <GiuSwiss> ninjala does not work on my switch yet XD
[3:56:07] <+trippersigs22> i wish the run speed was higher thats my only complaint
[3:56:17] <Joy_v0> @legacy0117 The caracther i choose i was really fast and more if you use the Y special + the R button
[3:56:24] <nepwar> what is the thing around the character icon on the left
[3:56:35] <%SuperKirby24> @trippersigs22 yea, it feels like you arent moving fast enough when you run
[3:56:36] <Ghostbody> As you said, your fun is secondary
[3:56:38] <+NYCrownlessKing> woolie needs a BIGG weapon
[3:56:41] <@Solidus_113> Ninja sense to see where enemies are
[3:56:57] <gustavozxd> SIZE
[3:56:58] <+BeetleJuicePapi> thats incorrect
[3:57:04] <%Exiliator> Size matters
[3:57:05] <%legacy0117> Then basketball is slow and big range, as a yo-yo weapon often is.
[3:57:13] <%Exiliator> Kappa
[3:57:17] <xdeathknightx> you need a black weapon Minh
[3:57:23] <+BeetleJuicePapi> wrong!
[3:57:30] <+Grayhammatter> of every weapon
[3:57:31] <+TheDyingPride> Of any weapon
[3:57:33] <+BeetleJuicePapi> you guys hace it misunderstood
[3:57:39] <Iwashi94> you already have big weapon I think?
[3:57:47] <+BeetleJuicePapi> that only lets you grow your gum shield
[3:57:47] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[3:57:49] <+TheOneCalledRock> your weapon is already big woolie
[3:57:53] <+TheDyingPride> Your weapon is already big
[3:57:56] <+dmtjinni> Minh gang

[3:58:19] <+Merhabi> Its bigger
[3:58:19] <+TheDyingPride> Big weapon, size go up
[3:58:34] <+NYCrownlessKing> I assume a larger hitbox
[3:58:35] <%legacy0117> Ohhhh you get to adjust the weapon's size Too? That is an excellent way to balance it all. :>
[3:58:38] <NekoZen> you start small
[3:58:38] <laguerrilha> You start with the small
[3:58:45] <+TheDyingPride> Because you have to build up to big
[3:58:45] <gustavozxd> oh my god
[3:58:46] <jazzygrooves> minh LUL
[3:58:48] <+NYCrownlessKing> "grind" for a bigger D Kappa
[3:58:53] <+Merhabi> I think you only get to adjust it bc you're in training mode

[4:02:04] <%Wool> NO THAT'S NOT TRUE
[4:02:04] <+TheOneCalledRock> minh that is NOT HOW THAT WORKS
[4:02:05] <Amardeux> you still need to know the theory
[4:02:07] <nepwar> a paper doesn't mean you stop learning
[4:02:07] <+Merhabi> That's NOT what that means
[4:02:07] <+armor_kuma> NO
[4:02:10] <Amardeux> OMGGGGGG
[4:02:10] <+PandaBanchou> but you wouldn't get the diploma in the first place
[4:02:12] <+TheDyingPride> No they don't
[4:02:13] <%legacy0117> Minh, did you learn by listening to people telling you how to do things?
[4:02:14] <%rubbishbinge> The model is completely optimal and humans are not optimal

[4:02:29] <+NYCrownlessKing> THEY NEED STEADY FINGERS tho lol
[4:02:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yes, because professionals never have to learn anything new. The field never changes.
[4:02:32] <%jiggy_snipe> like a operation type model
[4:02:35] <%legacy0117> Cause. You ought to get a few books.
[4:02:49] <+Taglog7> I want a doctor with a A ... cup
[4:02:51] <+liquidzr0> kinesthetic learner
[4:02:51] <Amardeux> yeah but Doctor's need both

[4:02:53] <Amardeux> omg
[4:02:53] <Reizie_Etherealm> I don't understand why people misunderstand Minh, it's just learning by doing it what's the big deal
[4:02:59] <%Visorak6> Doctors are ALWAYS learning minh
[4:03:02] <T_Sasquatch> I prefer working things out than simply reading but i get minh
[4:03:04] <laguerrilha> But you need to know knowledge to know how and what to practice....
[4:03:05] <BAM4LFE> there's a difference between a certified technician and a certified doctor dude
[4:03:05] <gustavozxd> alright
[4:03:05] <Kaji04> what
[4:03:06] <+armor_kuma> Dont worry I've killed a few people accidentally, I know how not to
[4:03:06] <%Exiliator> Would you trust a guy who learned to do surgery "in the field", probably on a battlefield or something. Or a guy who has never cut up someone, but hes read a lot of books
[4:03:06] <Amardeux> I wanna die inside
[4:03:08] <@Solidus_113> No doctor knows everything
[4:03:11] <%arkv01> minhs likes to play operation
[4:03:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> When's the last time Minh read a non-manga book?
[4:03:18] <%ggbhtg> BIG semantics going on
[4:03:18] <Amardeux> this is the 6 paths of Minh
[4:03:21] <+Quinn_Carter> Minh, I feel like you're trying to overexplain something very simple
[4:03:23] <+blkalucard1> learned it on the streets
[4:03:24] <scrublord009> ... this is just shinobi strikers LUL
[4:03:27] <seamoosethemoose> Minh cannot commit read.
[4:03:31] <+killfrost11> minh off on his crazy shit isnt he
[4:03:34] <misunderstood_poo> at least practice your handwriting
[4:03:36] <%jiggy_snipe> so this is why Minh won't play tutorials Kappa
[4:03:38] <%ggbhtg> HUGE semantics abound

[4:03:41] <+Sum_White_Guy> huh I coulda swore I was followed long before this
[4:03:43] <blue6sub6remnant6> You know medicine isn't s completely solved field, right Minh? Doctor go to conferences and learn about new ideas in medicine.
[4:03:44] <gustavozxd> Woolie is trying to exist
[4:03:48] <%arkv01> underground surgeon minh
[4:03:48] <+trippersigs22> Minhs right it doesnt matter HOW you learn something as long as you learned it
[4:03:51] <%legacy0117> This explains a lot.
[4:04:01] <Reizie_Etherealm> Reggie, you can learn that EVEN WITHOUT the tutorial
[4:04:11] <laguerrilha> then you wouldnt know how to parry, so no practice
[4:04:13] <%killfrost11> killfrost11 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[4:04:17] <+CMash2k> im not gonna trust a doctor who learned surgery by playing trauma team on the wii
[4:04:18] <+armor_kuma> BOOKS TELL YOU
[4:04:18] <Reizie_Etherealm> You can see others doing it, and then you can experiment to find out
[4:04:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> Minh taking the game grumps approach to gaming.

[4:05:19] <khetrak> @WoolieVersus hey woolie, is the game fun ?
[4:05:20] <+armor_kuma> You can shortcut experience by READING SHIT before it happens
[4:05:22] <Morning_Asakura> can we cool it pls NotLikeThis
[4:05:22] <%xpakeo> i hope this isnt in the ninjala anime video lol
[4:05:24] <+PandaBanchou> only a fool would repeat history instead from learning from it NotLikeThis

[4:05:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> @xpakeo I absolutely hope it is.
[4:05:34] <jazzygrooves> Like, i feel like reading how to do something and then trying to do it and nail it down is better than just blindly going through something LUL
[4:05:36] <%afronooch> minus a tactile learner, the gang discusses
[4:05:37] <%VaguelyKai> Minh's logic is basically how you learn anything BUT medical shit
[4:05:40] <+TheDyingPride> I will Raw level 3 on wakeup every single time until I get punished for it, THEN I'll try something else
[4:05:42] <+VantomPayne> cant wait for the video upload
[4:05:42] <LilacKing> HahaPoint
[4:05:47] <laguerrilha> Escalate into gun violence
[4:05:48] <Morning_Asakura> @jazzygrooves this
[4:05:49] <zenith0111> LEARN THROUGH EXPERIENCE
[4:05:51] <Shishi1205> Too late for that now, the patient is dead
[4:05:51] <+CMash2k> didnt minh literally get 8th place by using this mehod

[4:06:02] <Amardeux> My head hurts
[4:06:02] <+Taglog7> The life of a streamer. Invite friends, so you don't have to talk.
[4:06:03] <Amardeux> LUL
[4:06:04] <C4m3r0n0409> LUL
[4:06:07] <Tropicalhazard> Minh wants to play like a gorilla go unga my brother
[4:06:10] <Morning_Asakura> lol
[4:06:18] <%Exiliator> If you pick up a brand new fighting game, and are doing vs in 10 minutes. Would you rather play a few games against the AI blind, or only read through the tutorial?
[4:06:22] <%ggbhtg> this is the part where someone mentions a game mechanic with a weird button combination
[4:06:26] <%jiggy_snipe> Minh learns by doing or through practice and apparently does get anything from reading or theory
[4:06:28] <Morning_Asakura> same
[4:06:30] <Raldavar> Guys I think this is how Shippudan starts. Minh is going to join Dr. Chi Maru and Woolie has to go get him back
[4:06:34] <Morning_Asakura> its not fun
[4:06:35] <%arkv01> pound that mistakes pussy Kreygasm
[4:06:36] <AceAGod> Same
[4:06:39] <%legacy0117> Minh, you got to compare knowledge to pre-existing knowledge of others more experienced in that yhing.
[4:06:40] <xdeathknightx> woolie needs to know who the boss character is first
[4:06:42] <zenith0111> So you hate starting games?
[4:06:42] <crimsonsaens> People telling you systems is spoilers though
[4:06:43] <NiktenKing> Play chess without knowing the rules
[4:06:47] <laguerrilha> i hate not knowing not being able to use all avaible
[4:06:48] <%legacy0117> thing*
[4:06:54] <%ggbhtg> Max is like this too, Kenny Steve and Simmons aren't with fighting game
[4:06:55] <blue6sub6remnant6> Minh sez: "I can't understand why genocide is bad, I haven't had any bad experiences with it yet." NotLikeThis
[4:06:58] <%FuqBoiSlim> @exiliator I'd rather go to the lab just to learn the character's moves then a few matches against the cpu
[4:07:14] <laguerrilha> @ggbhtg Max tests it first, then tutorial
[4:07:15] <%Struggleful> I like getting bad about forgetting about game systems
[4:07:17] <T_Sasquatch> You do you
[4:07:20] <%Struggleful> mad*
[4:07:22] <$StaceMcGate> how's the game going so far
[4:07:22] <iggeh> @blue6sub6remnant6 You're really not helping with dumb statements like that
[4:07:28] <+trippersigs22> @Blue6subs thats an absurd take away
[4:07:30] <mrblack499> i think woolie would be better at nioh 2 then pat
[4:07:34] <blue6sub6remnant6> Fair.
[4:07:36] <%lazuli_alter> @blue6sub6remnant6 this is a real reach
[4:07:38] <%jiggy_snipe> testing then tutorial is cool
[4:07:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> Let's be honest, Minh is just going to grind the beginner zone until he's lvl 99.
[4:07:41] <+armor_kuma> "Hey I've made this mistake before, let me tell you so you can avoid it" Minh-"Nah"
[4:07:42] <%FuqBoiSlim> @blue6sub6remnant6 huh???
[4:07:49] <nepwar> im imagining someone going to organize sports with no knowledge whatsoever. learn by exp is pratical but you need those fundamentals.
[4:07:54] <%ggbhtg> SEMANTICS activated
[4:08:02] <laguerrilha> No, more quality time
[4:08:02] <%FuqBoiSlim> chat's full of bruh moments today
[4:08:03] <restingbones> same thing Reggie
[4:08:06] <nepwar> thats the same thing
[4:08:07] <laguerrilha> Quality> time
[4:08:08] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> That's the same thing Reggie lol
[4:08:13] <Shishi1205> yeah
[4:08:27] <+Taglog7> KNOWLEDGE IS POWER
[4:08:36] <Morning_Asakura> i like knowledge
[4:08:41] <stormydaysz> woolie and reggie want to learn , minh wants to button mash
[4:08:45] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> So you ignore it LUL
[4:08:46] <%xpakeo> someones gonna randomly click on the stream and will just be in awe at this conversation
[4:08:51] <%FuqBoiSlim> I'd rather learn the system first. so I can at least have an idea of what I'm doing wrong.
[4:08:51] <Amardeux> but why aren't you thinking about ti though minh LUL
[4:08:52] <scrublord009> By the logic. MIHN WHAT IS THE MEANING OF LIFE?????
[4:08:52] <%arkv01> minha gonna die on this no books hill
[4:08:53] <zenith0111> Learning through habit > Learning through reading
[4:08:56] <Reizie_Etherealm> If you don't apply it, it totally goes away
[4:09:05] <+NoobieSnake> Minh is a professional troll, lol
[4:09:06] <%ggbhtg> there are 2 paths. just choose the path you prefer. that's all @woolieversus
[4:09:09] <%legacy0117> Learning purely, by trial and error, means that you will be disconnected from people that learn by reading books or being taught by observation.
[4:09:14] <%lazuli_alter> I can't wait to rewatch this on youtube LUL
[4:09:16] <laguerrilha> Sounds like ADHD
[4:09:16] <%Exiliator> @FuqBoiSlim Yeah me too, which is what I mean. If I just read the manual, Ill have more trouble doing it, then if im shown it directly, and told to replicate.
[4:09:17] <%FuqBoiSlim> Going into a fighting game blind without knowing ANY of the systems and losing just make me feel stupid
[4:09:18] <Shishi1205> But its a combo, learn into practice
[4:09:19] <%rubbishbinge> best to use both
[4:09:20] <%jiggy_snipe> @zenith0111 clearly but you need to a base to build upon
[4:09:22] <scrublord009> Good Teachers LUL
[4:09:27] <+CMash2k> but wait by doing the tutorial dont you literally learn by doing the moves/techniques listed
[4:09:31] <%Wool> Good Teachers Get One
[4:09:35] <Amardeux> this is the 6 paths of Minh Kappa
[4:09:36] <%FuqBoiSlim> like something is being left out
[4:09:37] <zenith0111> They both go hand in hand dummies ;P
[4:09:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> Isn't not learning the system the whole reason why the Three Houses LP videos the way they were?
[4:09:40] <+trippersigs22> @legacy0117 no it doesnt its COMPLETELY prefrence
[4:09:44] <Reizie_Etherealm> I know for a fact there are more than 2 paths, in fact there are six.
[4:09:46] <Shishi1205> Its like doing the lab practical before reading the protocol
[4:09:49] <ManOfReason> woolie and reggie dont even disagree, they just prefer to read before learning through experience
[4:09:53] <@Solidus_113> Minh the heated gamer
[4:09:53] <laguerrilha> Its just that the "i dont read" example was not good
[4:09:57] <scrublord009> Shinobi Strikers /END
[4:09:58] <Morning_Asakura> why are we still talking about this
[4:09:59] <@Moobot> Enough with the emojis @gustavozxd
[4:10:04] <%Wool> Minh's about to use the heated gamer word
[4:10:09] <%ggbhtg> Chat, KETCHUP OR MUSTARD ONLY PICK ONE
[4:10:10] <%arkv01> minh needs that gamer pass ASAP
[4:10:12] <%legacy0117> Preference indeed.
[4:10:14] <%fetrigon> Minh you're always wrong
[4:10:16] <nepwar> it is scary when it was compared to medical field
[4:10:16] <scrublord009> Mihn about to drop the gamer word Kappa
[4:10:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> Is this going to end up on the pop off report?
[4:10:19] <+armor_kuma> Cause you said doctors should learn by fucking up

[4:10:27] <+CMash2k> using the doctor analogy led us here
[4:10:28] <+Dhrall> It's scary when you use a DOCTOR as an example
[4:10:29] <%Jetzord> Ketchup till I die
[4:10:31] <+tealplague> GAMER WORD INCOMING
[4:10:34] <+trippersigs22> Reggie it depends on the individual though

[4:10:40] <gustavozxd> so anyway ninjala is a videogame I think?

[4:10:42] <Amardeux> yeah its Scary when its a Doctor minh LUL
[4:10:47] <%rubbishbinge> Please don't learn to drive by trial and error

[4:10:53] <nepwar> trial and error psychology theories
[4:10:54] <blue6sub6remnant6> A mix of ketchup, mustard and mayo. On my fries. Like a degenerate.

[4:11:01] <nepwar> don't do that pls
[4:11:04] <$StaceMcGate> I just got here, is the server having issues? Is Woolie having fun?

[4:11:46] <+tuchpi> @FuqBoiSlim LUL
[4:11:46] <zenith0111> @rubbishbinge Both learning methods are kinda married to one another
[4:11:48] <%FuqBoiSlim> "I'll learn from my mistakes" Man the mistakes are gonna affect ME
[4:11:49] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[4:11:50] <%rubbishbinge> yeah
[4:11:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> Electrician, also a job you don't want to learn through trial and error.
[4:12:03] <%rubbishbinge> trial and error in controlled environment
[4:12:10] <%jiggy_snipe> i wouldnt put someone on the street immediately
[4:12:11] <+CMash2k> work with a full set of tools
[4:12:13] <Reizie_Etherealm> I think each method works in a case by case scenario
[4:12:16] <%DatAsuna> The important thing in fighting games is it isn't JUST trial and error when the "error" is another person trying to make you err
[4:12:17] <%jiggy_snipe> i learned the basics in the backyard
[4:12:33] <zenith0111> But we aren't playing a fighting game ResidentSleeper
[4:12:43] <%ggbhtg> if we're now just talking about video games.....I played Tekken incorrectly for YEARS @woolieversus because I nev-
[4:12:45] <gustavozxd> trial and error deadly rave, no guide on what button to press
[4:12:48] <laguerrilha> Extended trial and error is a bigger waste of time. i agree with mini trials between learning to solidify the content
[4:12:52] <%legacy0117> Yeah...
[4:12:54] <%ggbhtg> @zenith0111 aaand there it is
[4:13:00] <stormydaysz> ideally you use every method of learning , but we are just talking about video games right now
[4:13:04] <Amardeux> you need a mix of both
[4:13:07] <Amardeux> at the end of the day
[4:13:12] <Morning_Asakura> welp
[4:13:13] <nepwar> ye at the end of the day
[4:13:14] <zenith0111> @ggbhtg You know I'm right
[4:13:15] <+Meta_Yoroitoshi> It doesn't matter @zenith0111 lol it can apply to just about anything

[4:16:14] <zenith0111> @gl0vesup7 But I am enjoying it just acknowledging the pointless conversation like everyone else ResidentSleeper
[4:16:15] <%optimasmaximas> yup
[4:16:24] <%jiggy_snipe> Black Zetsu took it
[4:16:24] <Shishi1205> that happened

[4:16:27] <T_Sasquatch> Yea that was fucking rad tbh
[4:16:30] <%andrei11dr> Oh ,so he finishes NUNS4 ?
[4:16:33] <%rubbishbinge> Black Zetsu is on Obito
[4:16:35] <@Solidus_113> Minato's
[4:16:37] <+TheDyingPride> He didn't finish it
[4:16:37] <%optimasmaximas> @andrei11dr no
[4:16:38] <%Reverend_Roscoe> HE ALREADY HAD THE NINETAILS
[4:16:39] <T_Sasquatch> Coolest thing Sakura ever did
[4:16:42] <nepwar> 1+9+half of 9 from 4th= not dead nalt
[4:16:44] <iggeh> Nine Tails is inside Black Zetu @WoolieVersus
[4:16:44] <Damie904> Woolie forgot Zetsu took it from Minato
[4:16:46] <%Reverend_Roscoe> ZETSU INTERCEPTED THE NINETAILS
[4:16:51] <nepwar> *1+8+half of 9th
[4:16:51] <%andrei11dr> But he played it earlier?
[4:16:52] <Xenstroke> Zetsu
[4:16:55] <laguerrilha> they stopped after Night Guy
[4:16:56] <%Th3SmartAlec> He got the 9 Tails first when he blocked Minato. He then got the 1 and 8.
[4:16:56] <%optimasmaximas> @WoolieVersus black zetsu is attached to obito so when black zetsu took it obito had it
[4:16:56] <%rubbishbinge> Black Zetsu
[4:16:57] <%jiggy_snipe> Black Zetsu took it and Zetsu is on Obito right now
[4:16:58] <@Solidus_113> yes
[4:17:00] <gustavozxd> math hard
[4:17:03] <+TheDyingPride> The black Zetsu part of his body stole it before that part
[4:17:04] <%Reverend_Roscoe> YES
[4:17:04] <laguerrilha> yes
[4:17:06] <Shishi1205> thank you reggie
[4:17:08] <nepwar> oh yeah black zet
[4:17:12] <%Th3SmartAlec> yees
[4:17:14] <%rubbishbinge> And then Obito got control back
[4:17:16] <%Wool> Black Zetsu was still attached to Obito
[4:17:18] <mrblack499> sakura is useless lol
[4:17:19] <nepwar> so what is X and how do we solve for it
[4:17:20] <C4m3r0n0409> OBITO HAS BLACK ZETSU
[4:17:20] <+TheDyingPride> yes
[4:17:23] <%jiggy_snipe> Zetsu and Obito are the same person essentially right now
[4:17:28] <nepwar> 1+8+x=9???
[4:17:28] <%Reverend_Roscoe> TO GIVE TO MADARA
[4:17:37] <+TheDyingPride> Black Zetsu was in control at first
[4:17:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> Zetsu was in control no?
[4:17:41] <C4m3r0n0409> That was black zetsu
[4:17:44] <Morning_Asakura> no that was setsu
[4:17:44] <Shishi1205> Nah black zetsu absorved it
[4:17:46] <+PenGia> Zetsu was still in control then
[4:17:46] <laguerrilha> Obito still had the 9 tails, then he got the 8 and 1 tail as a plus
[4:17:48] <Sandro2584> NO
[4:17:50] <gustavozxd> zeus? oh zetsu
[4:17:51] <Morning_Asakura> zetsu*
[4:17:53] <nepwar> oh yeaaa
[4:17:54] <@Solidus_113> Black Zetsu took the 9 Tails, then Obito woke back up and tricked Madara
[4:17:54] <+wahoohee> Hey y'all a new Ninjala Reddit was made called /r/NinjalaSwitch It is rlly cool check it out
[4:17:57] <%jiggy_snipe> did he do anything with 1 and 8?

[4:18:34] <%jiggy_snipe> Nobito Kappa
[4:18:36] <C4m3r0n0409> Yes
[4:18:37] <mrblack499> there are no sakura fans lol
[4:18:43] <%Th3SmartAlec> But then you add Might Guy to the mix, and Madara's chances of winning drastic go down

[0:12:01] <armchairmaster_> @josef_stryker part of me wants to jump into For Honor, another part of me remebers the sheer amount of SALT that game makes me feel.
[0:12:42] <%Josef_Stryker> That recently overhauled the gameplay changes so it's more read based as opposed to reaction based. And they made it so light spam can actually be countered
[0:13:12] <%chosenjuan42> yo
[0:13:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> Knowing that Minh grinds harder than me, he is going to be completely maxed out before Act 3.

[0:20:40] <Djinnazz> words change woolie
[0:20:47] <OldManDeckardCain> people saying cringe tend to be cringe themselves
[0:20:53] <olaksi> saying cringe is cringe
[0:20:55] <%DensityD> moist
[0:20:56] <+paladinstarbuster> based baed cringe cringe
[0:20:58] <%jetjagger222> its repurposed slang

[0:21:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> cringe is cringe
[0:21:02] <armchairmaster_> Woolie hates modernity? C r i n g e
[0:21:04] <+amiroodude> everything is epic and cringe
[0:21:04] <%tearfuldevil> i mean a cringe is a facial expression
[0:21:18] <%tearfuldevil> if something makes you cringe, i guess its cringe?
[0:21:19] <%Chatterbox1991> Gascoigne
[0:21:23] <brunoberserk> woolie VS C R I N G E
[0:21:26] <+yayaoi> we live in a society
[0:21:27] <%Chatterbox1991> also hi Woolie
[0:21:27] <Arisato_II> HE SAID THE THING
[0:21:29] <ToastyBroDude> we live in a society
[0:21:34] <armchairmaster_> S i m p s are preety c r i n g e
[0:21:36] <lemonfont> Language is amorphous
[0:21:39] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Things that literally make me cringe are cringe
[0:21:40] <%DensityD> we cringe in a society
[0:21:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> not gonna lie, language is kinda cringe
[0:22:03] <%Chatterbox1991> We Simp in a Cringeity
[0:22:05] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1290540030302334977?s=20
[0:22:12] <olaksi> Internet kills meaning. Do "cucked" and "simping" actually mean anything anymore? those words had a half life of 2 weeks
[0:22:13] <%cobalt_phoenix_> jk evolving language is cool
[0:22:19] <DSD24> Based is cool
[0:22:25] <%CptnCampy61> Words also get ruined. The word “literally” doesn’t mean anything anymore since everyone abuses it
[0:22:28] <%tearfuldevil> based on what
[0:22:29] <%Chatterbox1991> What is Based actually?
[0:22:30] <%BisoromiBear> based is our word
[0:22:35] <%Chatterbox1991> like a misspelling of Blessed?
[0:22:42] <%lewdskeletor13> Based Samuria Jin
[0:22:43] <lemonfont> I'm surprised based is still being used today
[0:22:48] <+Arkfyre> 🅱️ ased
[0:22:49] <%DianaTheAscian> what does based even mean?
[0:22:53] <%Chatterbox1991> ^
[0:22:55] <+paladinstarbuster> "BASED ON WHAT?" LUL
[0:23:08] <KaseKaizer> stripBruh
[0:23:13] <heartlesshealer> word rendered worthless
[0:23:13] <%FuqBoiSlim> I DONT EVEN KNOW WHAT BASED MEANS ANYMORE I JUST SAY IT
[0:23:16] <%DensityD> NotLikeThis
[0:23:17] <Djinnazz> What's the definition of Irony again?
[0:23:20] <%FuqBoiSlim> HELP ME
[0:23:25] <%DianaTheAscian> NO
[0:23:25] <+ArtyFM> literally is used as hyperbole in a figurative context
[0:23:26] <lemonfont> This cringe is literally based
[0:23:26] <%Chatterbox1991> i am having flashbacks to gramattical arguments with my fucking sister god help me >.<
[0:23:27] <%GeneralSCPatton> Literally is now mostly used as an intensifier for emphasis
[0:23:29] <@akuda_bar> based just means like... blessed. afaik
[0:23:32] <armchairmaster_> It's very b a s e d how it's been agreed that s i m p s are forever c r i n g e. It's p o g g e r s that we can all agree on language like that.
[0:23:36] <DSD24> Words are hard
[0:23:38] <Shishi1205> 🅱️
[0:23:42] <%Chatterbox1991> WORDS IS DUMB
[0:23:45] <%halfmasks> oh wow i wasnt expecting a stream today
[0:23:47] <olaksi> It's like how in evangelion they kill that one angel be accelerating it's evolution, because the final step of evolution is death. Internet is same for words
[0:23:49] <MutedMimic> LUL
[0:23:51] <%jetjagger222> linguistic drift
[0:23:56] <enZymeth> LUL
[0:23:56] <%FuqBoiSlim> Based and Honor-pilled
[0:23:59] <+ArtyFM> yeah scp
[0:24:01] <%DianaTheAscian> language is dumb
[0:24:37] <%CptnCampy61> The horse also pops up out of nowhere
[0:24:37] <DSD24> Welcome back to LEAVES the Game
[0:24:38] <%johnny_gogo> i missed last sesssion where they at?
[0:24:41] <brunoberserk> lets fucking GO
[0:24:51] <Floydthemaggot> ayyy for once i can catch the manga
[0:25:04] <fruit_pie_the_magician> It used to just be funny to USE literally as like......comical hyperbole. But then everybody just thought people were using it correctly
[0:25:05] <%lewdskeletor13> That was quick
[0:25:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oof
[0:25:07] <armchairmaster_> Let's get this show on the road. *reggie leaves*
[0:25:11] <%Wool> oh stream canceled
[0:25:12] <%DensityD> people are trying to broaden the scope of the word "cringe", but what they've mostly done is deepen the negative connotations that it carries. it may change further
[0:25:13] <armchairmaster_> He back
[0:25:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wow
[0:25:19] <%GeneralSCPatton> I was half way through when I figured that one out, and now it's just like "Oh, I have 10 bodies in this one patch of grass, and they keep falling for it"
[0:25:24] <@akuda_bar> that used to happen to me too
[0:25:24] <%cobalt_phoenix_> what if it's wired?
[0:25:26] <+evbites> another controller?
[0:25:34] <armchairmaster_> Dmc4
[0:25:35] <+Arkfyre> hard wire it
[0:25:36] <brunoberserk> this feel like a CURSE
[0:25:36] <Shishi1205> Wired only charges the controller
[0:25:36] <%DianaTheAscian> we gonna get crunchy? or did they fix that?
[0:25:45] <%johnny_gogo> my ps4 controller some times hard disconnects
[0:25:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait what
[0:25:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> my life is a lie
[0:25:53] <DSD24> AH yeah the dulcet tones of DMC4
[0:25:54] <+evbites> reset?
[0:25:59] <%DesertPenguin> No
[0:26:02] <%DensityD> IT'S BACK
[0:26:04] <%DesertPenguin> Tell the PS4 to treat it as a USB and not bluetooth
[0:26:08] <@akuda_bar> it's like the ps4 is choking on shit, idk, it didn't seem to be the controller when it happened to me
[0:26:12] <Arisato_II> ! CURSED !
[0:26:13] <+Dr_DangerPhD> my old controller used to get like that when the battery was getting low
[0:26:19] <%DesertPenguin> You plug it in and tell the PS4 that it's USB
[0:26:23] <lemonfont> yo, what's this bgm???
[0:26:27] <%DensityD> what's the beverage of choice for everyone today?
[0:26:36] <lemonfont> Machiatto

[0:28:06] <Psyramics> that sounds like nonsense, especially in a big tournament setting
[0:28:08] <Sol_Install> weird
[0:28:09] <%cobalt_phoenix_> will it be considerable for this game?
[0:28:14] <%DensityD> the PS5 will fix it, surely Kappa
[0:28:14] <+Rigmarole111> Is PS4 still using USB 2.0?
[0:28:15] <%DesertPenguin> Thought it might solve the problem, oh well

[0:29:37] <@akuda_bar> i swear it's the menu lagging not the controller. but i'm not an expert

[0:33:36] <T_Sasquatch> "easier"
[0:33:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> Who needs to parry when you can dodge?
[0:33:40] <Silentpriced> parry charm = best charm
[0:33:58] <%Chatterbox1991> N E T C O D E
[0:34:00] <T_Sasquatch> i honestly never noticed a difference using the parry charm
[0:34:07] <T_Sasquatch> guess im just good Kappa
[0:34:08] <%JD_Lars> New Dokapon was announced. Has online and bots.
[0:34:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i like the parry charm until i got other charms, i had to make room for it and it didn't seem to do much for me

[0:35:42] <olaksi> eeeh, that's not really a latency test
[0:35:46] <armchairmaster_> Charm of Ametarasu is SO GOOD it's almost a perma-addition for me, that and Charm of Inari.
[0:35:52] <%Andrizzleton> the tech is good

[0:37:43] <%jetjagger222> coors light jingasa
[0:37:46] <armchairmaster_> @woolieversus You can buy a better hat from the merchants for about 20 flowers
[0:37:57] <RoldanDgr8> The upgraded ronin hat is pretty good
[0:38:08] <+amiroodude> They'll be more hats
[0:38:22] <DSD24> There's so many hats
[0:38:32] <%ChoculaUltra> a lotta the cool ones are out in the wild too which is dope\
[0:38:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> should we advise to gather crickets?
[0:39:05] <T_Sasquatch> crickets arent important tho
[0:39:07] <sonofthedeepsouth> memes
[0:39:16] <%DensityD> something something something THE COLE PROTOCOL
[0:39:19] <T_Sasquatch> plus they are a bitch to find
[0:39:25] <armchairmaster_> @cobalt_phoenix_ eh, just remind woolie whenever he passes a cemetary
[0:39:28] <+AsinPersuasion> wait he's still in act 1? lmao
[0:39:31] <Djinnazz> not really
[0:39:45] <%Andrizzleton> Is Minh in charge of putting 15 ads in the CSB youtube videos?
[0:39:49] <sonofthedeepsouth> Woolie has snuffed in the game this many puppers 567. That's a lot ain't it
[0:39:51] <+AsinPersuasion> yes
[0:40:00] <sonofthedeepsouth> Almost like he is hnting puppers
[0:40:04] <%johnny_gogo> armor upgrades improve how all outfits look
[0:40:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> don't need too many, just enough to get next song. and it's not needed til later
[0:40:10] <%DemonOfSalt> DemonOfSalt subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak! Big honor to House Woolie. May your sword cut through enemies like as if they water (which technical we all are anyway).
[0:40:17] <T_Sasquatch> honestly im surprised how little i cared about killing dogs in this game
[0:40:31] <+Arkfyre> cows PogChamp
[0:40:34] <%GeneralSCPatton> What cosmetic aesthetics have you guys used? I went for all white and the gold headband early on, switched to all gold/yellow for a bit, and went full black edgelord when I got the 5th stance.
[0:40:34] <brunoberserk> @WoolieVersus you can also change the colors of your costumes and armor
[0:40:35] <%ChoculaUltra> nah fuck the dogs in this game in particular. They super suck
[0:40:43] <Arisato_II> but can you pet the cow?
[0:40:48] <+zanzibar_junker> All dogs got kunai'd
[0:40:49] <DSD24> The Mongel Dogs while super fluffy are a pain to fight
[0:40:54] <%ChoculaUltra> unparriable bite my ass.

[0:44:59] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[0:45:00] <Arisato_II> no Skyrim in this game

[0:45:09] <DSD24> Minh loves breaking his legs
[0:45:12] <Zehdre> Can also jump off the horse before it lands like it's Yoshi.
[0:45:16] <%DesertPenguin> Finish the fight
[0:45:18] <%GeneralSCPatton> Cliff KO is such a great shortcut
[0:45:25] <%DesertPenguin> Minh, we're not playing Dokapon anymore!!!
[0:45:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> horse can't die
[0:45:33] <sonofthedeepsouth> you wouldn't download a horse

[0:46:18] <T_Sasquatch> @cobalt_phoenix_ rmzSTARE yea
[0:46:26] <shogun_133> There is an ability you can put a point into that lets you roll after you fall to avoid damage. if you are annoyed by cliffs you might want it.
[0:46:33] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Use the Fhorse
[0:46:38] <Arisato_II> untrustful fall damage
[0:46:45] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @T_Sasquatch :)
[0:46:58] <%vVAstrAVv> minhs right and i love that feature
[0:47:06] <Zehdre> It's weird how it even saves objectives and dead enemies through deaths. Makes it way easier than it should be.
[0:47:07] <sonofthedeepsouth> Jin what do you see with your Japanese eyes?
[0:47:19] <sonofthedeepsouth> They are taking the children to the mainland

[0:48:23] <sonofthedeepsouth> crickets cages
[0:48:41] <Zehdre> I think deer just don't give anything, like no materials.
[0:48:43] <shogun_133> @GeneralSCPatton Bambi comes out and whoops your ass.
[0:48:44] <sonofthedeepsouth> how tho
[0:48:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> Woolie is stealing grave crickets.
[0:48:50] <T_Sasquatch> @GeneralSCPatton literally nothing
[0:48:53] <+arancet> @GeneralSCPatton nothing, far as i've seen, its just totally pointless
[0:49:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> Get fucked, dead people, I'm stealing your cricket.
[0:49:12] <DSD24> Straw Hat bois

[0:50:28] <CursedNobleman> man, the boat shaped hats look so stupid LUL
[0:50:36] <%GeneralSCPatton> @sonofthedeepsouth And that's why tieing the weather system to an invisible honor meter is so great.
[0:50:48] <brunoberserk> who is ready for the infamous woolie's RUST ?
[0:51:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> NICE
[0:51:18] <%lewdskeletor13> Mhhhh that’s some crusty rust
[0:51:30] <Parapattern> Going to attack the mongols. Not back, avenge death.
[0:51:42] <%GeneralSCPatton> This is a complete shot in the dark, but I assume this game ends with a rad duel in the middle of a hurricane
[0:51:46] <T_Sasquatch> Its easy to platinum but it still takes time . Its not a tedious platinum
[0:52:05] <sonofthedeepsouth> Fuck off someone would have heard that

[0:58:39] <%Andrizzleton> I can't believe woolie is a filthy dub watcher
[0:58:53] <sonofthedeepsouth> he is a chinaboo
[0:59:09] <sonofthedeepsouth> he been reading that romance of the three kingdoms

[0:59:51] <%DensityD> woolie mumbled it, but I think he said xeno
[0:59:58] <lutefiiisk> Daily reminder that Pat The Coward didn't want to stream this GLORIOUS game because it wasn't "historically accurate"
[1:00:09] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> Aw man I don't like Ryuzo's voice
[1:00:10] <KaseKaizer> PJSalt
[1:00:11] <sonofthedeepsouth> wait wwhat

[1:00:46] <shadowblazerx2> Hmm, Jin is more expressive in Japanese than in English
[1:00:46] <%bread_assassin> @lutefiiisk Pat didn't stream it because DP2 won the poll.
[1:00:51] <sonofthedeepsouth> I won that round tho
[1:00:56] <%huskarl_zap> You were down to twenty percent hp
[1:00:58] <NotHereToStream> 0-10 close
[1:00:59] <lutefiiisk> Looks to me like Pat was the one that lost.

[1:02:13] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @lutefiiisk @huskarl_zap he exaggerates just how innacurate it is, it's like being unable to watch Kingdom of Heaven because the style mail armor or fortress architecture isn't exactly accurate

[1:03:38] <%bread_assassin> Is there really any point to the spear parry move, when you get another ability that auto-parries spear attacks during any wind style attack?
[1:03:40] <T_Sasquatch> spear dudes are the hardest enemies

[1:35:08] <sonofthedeepsouth> helps you find secrets
[1:35:09] <lobotomized_teddy_bear> i am still dissapointed that this game is set decades before Kabuki theater was a thing.
[1:35:10] <ralphfromdk> It's a more natural way instead of buying maps for the things you look for.
[1:35:11] <%DensityD> 👀
[1:35:24] <%Halospaz117> Also it makes you look like Samurai Jack
[1:35:33] <DSD24> Gotta get back to the past

[1:35:46] <%Halospaz117> Samurai Jack
[1:35:55] <Shishi1205> Form 10 to 20

[1:36:09] <DSD24> Excited for that new Samurai Jack game!
[1:36:11] <CursedNobleman> scaramucci was the best samurai jack villain
[1:36:24] <akosinoogie> "Come on Jack, whip it out babe"
[1:36:27] <%DensityD> THE CLEANEST
[1:36:28] <sonofthedeepsouth> Just be like morrowind. You wanna find the cool loot? fuck you walk
[1:36:31] <ralphfromdk> On the traveler. With patch 1.06, when you a near a collectable, a small firefly will shpw up and guide you to it, a bit like the birds will do with places
[1:36:44] <masterfire23> i saw the samurai jack ghist of tsushima commercial and i was so confused LUL
[1:36:48] <%GeneralSCPatton> Nothing feels more disrespectful than wiping a mongol camp without taking off the exploration outfit. Who needs combat buffs?
[1:36:51] <%DensityD> cute little firefly, makes me think of a Disney character
[1:36:57] <brunoberserk> looking like ukyo tachibana from samsho
[1:37:16] <%DensityD> THE MINH WAY
[1:37:19] <Admiral_PopnFresh> The extra fur covering the scabbard was thing for a long time, usually very ceremonial or flashy
[1:37:22] <DSD24> @brunoberserk Lets hope Jin doesn't get Consumption
[1:37:25] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I really want a modern game like that takes place in like the Middle East. That'd be sick
[1:37:48] <CursedNobleman> they can call it assassins creed or something
[1:37:51] <CursedNobleman> itll make millions!
[1:37:52] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Charms become more useful than outfit buff though
[1:37:54] <ralphfromdk> DensityD Let's be honest.... dead father guiding him through wind... dead mother guiding him through birds... gods guiding him through foxes... Jin is a Disney princess :p
[1:37:57] <@akuda_bar> @CursedNobleman lmao
[1:38:08] <%Halospaz117> The game ain't called "Tangible Loud Boy of Tsushima"
[1:38:26] <%DesertPenguin> I just wanna see something come out of that fancy box you guys got
[1:38:34] <%CptnCampy61> Only a few missions

[1:39:34] <DSD24> @cobalt_phoenix_ Woolie got new threads
[1:39:37] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ooh new dye
[1:39:56] <ralphfromdk> There are precisely enough points to get every single skill in the game. depending how much you do before moving on and how many random encounters you do, you can be maxed out 2/3rds through the game.
[1:39:56] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:40:00] <sonofthedeepsouth> be coward to be brave
[1:40:04] <+gus_hornblende> Fun fact Woolie, if you get tired of seeing the bow on your back, you can hide it by equipping a bomb-type weapon Quiver still shows up unless you empty all your ammo, though.
[1:40:05] <%DensityD> I want fan art of smokey the bear
[1:40:07] <NotHereToStream> no honour
[1:40:07] <Zehdre> Who would imagine Woolie would like the white and blue outfit.

[1:41:56] <%DensityD> the way that tree spawned in was strange
[1:42:16] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[1:42:18] <%GeneralSCPatton> Woolie refuses the concept of subtlety. He fights head on in games where that's the only choice, and fights head on in games that give stealth options. Why would you ever try something new?
[1:42:25] <ralphfromdk> Jin will tell you when you are just about the right place, he will go "hmm, maybe around here" or something like that
[1:42:44] <Zehdre> He has been stealthing.
[1:42:57] <sonofthedeepsouth> CAVERNS

[1:45:31] <%BallerSwagBro9k> TBFP BibleThump
[1:45:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> @zehdre Yeah, he stealths a little bit. But I don't see why stealth wouldn't be your main focus in games with so many mechanics for it, when most games don't.
[1:45:55] <%lewdskeletor13> DLC horse
[1:45:56] <@akuda_bar> horse is like FOR FUCK SAKE
[1:46:01] <estacado262> Most of the duels in this game are dope
[1:46:03] <Zehdre> This game's stealth really isn't all that interesting and the combat is way more interesting with lots of technique sand stances.
[1:46:06] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @generalscpatton it's almost like Woolie likes playing the game his way lol
[1:46:08] <akosinoogie> i wonder if the mythic quests will grant you Demon-Slayer type shit

[1:49:17] <Reveresao> I hate these little cutscenes
[1:49:27] <ralphfromdk> I'm pretty sure you can't actually hurt civilians... I tried and they did not die :l
[1:49:35] <%CptnCampy61> The feet tech works until you stand-off in tall grass
[1:49:36] <akosinoogie> @Solid_Stro where'd you do that?
[1:49:44] <%lewdskeletor13> You can hit civilians worth your sword but they don’t die

[1:50:58] <Robot_Nixon_> muh immersion 😡
[1:50:59] <%lewdskeletor13> LP funsies
[1:51:01] <ha2ken> Minh likes to max out super early and then steamroll the game
[1:51:12] <%lewdskeletor13> Remember when you killed all those kids in Halo
[1:51:13] <benjehuda> I'm just saying brotha...
[1:51:19] <therealtacopancakes> Minh is the guy from black mirror that tortures npcs
[1:51:23] <%GeneralSCPatton> @abelincoln_catpuncher I get that he likes it that way. I'm totally nitpicking. It just feels like disrespecting the subgenre to pretend that the stealth game is not a stealth game and doing the same straight fights you can do in all other games. There's an itch that only stealth games can scratch with the systematic takedowns. Woolie clearly doesn't get that itch tho.
[1:51:23] <%lewdskeletor13> You did hit him a few times tho

[1:52:27] <JetpackMcQuack> He's learning how to play the game
[1:52:28] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Some trust fund kid asshole is running around in his PJs calling everyone cowards
[1:52:51] <+dawsfloss> god the grass in this game looks like my heavily modded skyrim LUL aeyviThinking
[1:53:14] <%Halospaz117> I don't think the horse runs out

[1:54:46] <ToastyBroDude> Yuna got caught lookin aty DAT ASS
[1:54:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> Act with honor on and off the battlefield. But also shank bitches tho
[1:54:56] <sonofthedeepsouth> supress those emotions
[1:55:16] <@akuda_bar> i thought for a second he was entering a standoff with his horse
[1:55:21] <+Solid_Stro> Let that hate and sadness turn into something you can use later doodBait
[1:55:27] <Dragonborn983> Reggie is the on camera manifestation of the one guy.
[1:55:28] <brunoberserk> you have the high ground
[1:55:35] <juxtest> You'd think that eventually the Mongols would stop agreeing to do those
[1:55:47] <JetpackMcQuack> Goofy shit on twitter LUL
[1:55:52] <%Halospaz117> Yeah camera can get wonk in standoffs
[1:55:59] <%GeneralSCPatton> I have had some terrible standoffs with a bush in the camera
[1:56:27] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Yeah the Mongals are rather honourable to always accepr your challenges
[1:56:38] <akosinoogie> everyone got super silent at reggie's suggestion, hmm
[1:56:50] <T_Sasquatch> ive had standoffs with enemies less than a foot away
[1:57:13] <%Lightwolfe> Monty Python drums as he comes running
[1:57:15] <+Solid_Stro> Spear dudes are the hardest when it comes to standoffs
[1:57:18] <sonofthedeepsouth> beach episode
[1:57:26] <%GeneralSCPatton> @juxtest But that would just provoke more shankings
[1:57:40] <Shishi1205> yo flute on point
[1:57:50] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> I had a standoff where the game broke and the other guy was just standing there for 10 minutes
[1:57:56] <GarbageNirvana> This is a fantasy world
[1:58:07] <GarbageNirvana> Jin Sakai is a Disney princess
[1:58:09] <%tearfuldevil> there pretty places in nature irl woolie
[1:58:09] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> I reloaded the game
[1:58:09] <ralphfromdk> I mean... you need some kind of indicator to point people in the right direcition... The color of flowers is an easy way to do that.
[1:58:11] <akosinoogie> Minh's story about that standoff delay reminds me of the God Hand cutscene where the guy lines up with the window to get punched out of it
[1:58:13] <%lewdskeletor13> It is a mythic quest
[1:58:15] <Robot_Nixon_> he painted it like 10 min ago Kappa
[1:58:16] <T_Sasquatch> art team dabbing on everyone
[1:58:25] <+mikesapartment> next time I won't miss
[1:58:26] <%GeneralSCPatton> @chiazamformerlymankeyfigh He was just pralyzed with fear by your fighting spirit
[1:58:35] <%lewdskeletor13> It’s worth it
[1:58:38] <sonofthedeepsouth> no
[1:58:43] <+amiroodude> Your last last chance
[1:58:46] <Shishi1205> fuck off monk
[1:58:51] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Are these your paintings dude?
[1:59:37] <%lewdskeletor13> Maybe he’s a little out of his mind
[1:59:41] <%cobalt_phoenix_> yee
[1:59:55] <+Just_GR> Is that Youpi?
[2:00:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> It's a little disappointing how early you run out of gear upgrades
[2:00:16] <Reveresao> NO HONOR
[2:00:19] <sonofthedeepsouth> just steal people horses
[2:00:32] <Zehdre> Samurai are allowed to take horses. It's not stealing.
[2:00:34] <%lewdskeletor13> You’re the lord, it’s just a tax
[2:00:40] <+jiggy_snipe> Link has been a lord the entire time PogChamp
[2:00:41] <sonofthedeepsouth> why not take their daughter viginity too you know
[2:00:46] <Archmortal> This is why we need to tax the rich
[2:00:47] <akosinoogie> H o r s e T a x
[2:00:49] <%lewdskeletor13> Steal from those feudal peasants
[2:00:50] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Do you know who my Uncle is?

[2:01:19] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:01:22] <theCoolChild> These Wools ain't loyal
[2:01:39] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Always mashing upon the pad
[2:02:05] <Archmortal> Ride straight at them and you get a lot more time for standoffing than if you stop to get off your horse while they stare at you
[2:02:05] <Shishi1205> yoink
[2:02:36] <sonofthedeepsouth> slash those peasants
[2:02:37] <Zehdre> Time to test that new sword kit 4Head

[2:07:35] <%mechslayer71> Did he move up to Lethal?
[2:07:40] <%vVAstrAVv> theres basically a blue spirit mask at least
[2:07:48] <ha2ken> Fight your demons
[2:07:55] <%GeneralSCPatton> Still using Water Stance
[2:07:57] <%lewdskeletor13> This music brownDOGGERS
[2:07:58] <%Halospaz117> Swap your dang stance Woolie
[2:07:59] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> ARE YOU SURE
[2:07:59] <%mechslayer71> STANCE
[2:08:00] <sonofthedeepsouth> FUCK YOUR DEMONS
[2:08:00] <GarbageNirvana> yo this shit is metal
[2:08:03] <Idon__> sword style would probably help
[2:08:05] <Admiral_PopnFresh> This is so FUCKING COOL
[2:08:11] <ralphfromdk> Woolie using shieldstance just for coolpoints? :p
[2:08:13] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> stance
[2:08:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> stance
[2:08:21] <%lewdskeletor13> All these duels are great
[2:08:22] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:08:23] <Zehdre> He probably forgot about stances.
[2:08:25] <%GeneralSCPatton> Drop your stance, you know what I mean?
[2:08:37] <%vVAstrAVv> yall shield stance is really good in duels shush
[2:08:38] <T_Sasquatch> i beat him on hard with just water stance, it doesnt matter
[2:08:40] <+amiroodude> Close
[2:08:40] <%cobalt_phoenix_> F
[2:08:41] <sonofthedeepsouth> DABBED ON
[2:08:41] <+ALazo> bad trip
[2:08:41] <Admiral_PopnFresh> F
[2:08:43] <Reveresao> wrong stance
[2:08:53] <Idon__> Woolie ya stance
[2:08:53] <+Kyma1020> Stone
[2:08:53] <%vVAstrAVv> the charged triangle flurry mainly
[2:08:54] <%lewdskeletor13> Stone stance is best against swordsman
[2:08:56] <+Arkfyre> it does matter
[2:08:57] <%toastybites> damn that 2 step
[2:08:57] <%DesertPenguin> You have to hit him WOolie
[2:09:00] <Idon__> it HARD matters
[2:09:02] <%DesertPenguin> Drop your shield?
[2:09:14] <%GeneralSCPatton> It has never mattered more
[2:09:14] <Reveresao> it does if you want stagger
[2:09:23] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> It does
[2:09:26] <%mechslayer71> Playing big games ones a week, winning strategy Kappa Kappa Kappa
[2:09:29] <ralphfromdk> Wrong stance means heavy attack barely does anything.
[2:09:30] <akosinoogie> First it was the Bow Charge, now it's the Stance
[2:09:44] <T_Sasquatch> it makes it easier but it doesnt mean you cant beat him without the other stances
[2:09:53] <%lewdskeletor13> They’re pretty short
[2:09:59] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Wrong stance is essentially a self imposed difficulty bump
[2:10:01] <Idon__> GG EZ
[2:10:03] <%illtima> I think I know what fight Minh means. It was tough
[2:10:04] <Shishi1205> Insight gained
[2:10:04] <+amiroodude> YEYEYE
[2:10:07] <%vVAstrAVv> yall sword stances heavy hits barely connect without their speed upgrade
[2:10:10] <%lewdskeletor13> Hell yeah

[2:10:53] <Shishi1205> Shuriken PogChamp
[2:10:59] <T_Sasquatch> this game needs a duel menu , I really want to retry duels for style points
[2:11:02] <+Arkfyre> @WoolieVersus The japanese varition of those blue flowers has a marajuana-like effect.
[2:11:03] <Shishi1205> Oh its a stikcy
[2:11:06] <sonofthedeepsouth> STICKY BOMB

[2:11:10] <T_Sasquatch> ssmokeeee
[2:11:10] <GarbageNirvana> Ninja vanish!
[2:11:17] <ralphfromdk> Using smoke bombs lets you assassinate people in the middle of combat :D
[2:11:20] <T_Sasquatch> smoke + chain assassination is nuts
[2:11:21] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Smoke bomb is busted with chain assassinations
[2:11:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LOOK AT THAT BIG HONOR AS YOU RUN

[2:11:48] <Idon__> Basically the anti-tank gun
[2:11:54] <T_Sasquatch> @akosinoogie we can only dream , I so highly doubt that with a western game
[2:11:56] <%vVAstrAVv> theirs your rifle
[2:11:56] <Shishi1205> Ymi time

[2:13:20] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Go see Sensei your sexy new boy toy
[2:13:29] <%vVAstrAVv> get the slowdown to shoot with more big honor
[2:13:58] <SpaceGuntank> i never noticed how the little deely on the front is for measuring wind direction
[2:14:02] <%GeneralSCPatton> It's a very efficient and compact interface for swapping everything. UI devs did a great job.

[2:40:19] <akosinoogie> Mongols made some bitchin' armor it seems. Skallagrim taught me abt that
[2:40:37] <nintega010> @BallerSwagBro9k I think it's better after the update & depends on difficulty
[2:41:13] <%cobalt_phoenix_> c i n e m a t i c
[2:41:18] <Reveresao> Woolie remember you can hold triangle
[2:41:32] <%lewdskeletor13> DOSHO

[2:42:34] <%ChoculaUltra> kunais are op
[2:42:37] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> brigette mains
[2:42:58] <Djinnazz> yeah
[2:43:04] <+Arkfyre> the shield hold is super good
[2:43:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> keep pressing triangle after the relase with shield stance
[2:43:05] <Meltgar> Aren't those finishers? the stab one
[2:43:06] <heart_ablaze> yes
[2:43:09] <T_Sasquatch> Water stance flurry
[2:43:19] <%cobalt_phoenix_> you don't need to hold long
[2:43:21] <ralphfromdk> The shield one is really good at breaking shield stagger.
[2:43:25] <Reveresao> make them stagger faster
[2:43:25] <%GeneralSCPatton> You can mash triangle after the triangle-hold for some of those
[2:43:31] <%lewdskeletor13> It helps break their posture and it lets you do a flurry of attacks after it
[2:43:35] <TopLeftCenter> At first they don't matter much but the upgrades make them stupid strong
[2:43:44] <%cobalt_phoenix_> he ate too many shrimp
[2:43:48] <akosinoogie> i thought woolue was gonna point-black the horse, holy shit
[2:43:52] <+thebabyseal3060> the charge flurry is amazing for shield guys
[2:44:01] <%vVAstrAVv> shields charge will stagger and kill any shield dudes and is great in duels against them too
[2:44:01] <%samura1_queen19> The lighting makes the house pink

[2:44:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> god maxed shield stance is great with triangle combo
[2:44:36] <Meltgar> Who sends an archer to duel?!
[2:45:14] <Shishi1205> Getting BMed

[2:48:31] <%vVAstrAVv> ALWAYS save prisoners theyll tell you about undiscovered enemy camps
[2:48:58] <%vVAstrAVv> which when you do them all clears the whole map
[2:49:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> Endless breadcrumbs of dopamine
[2:49:13] <%tearfuldevil> woolie hasn't played many open world games lol

[2:51:29] <JetpackMcQuack> Before medication
[2:51:47] <AThing_> That horse has a horse lock
[2:51:52] <AThing_> Can't defeat it
[2:51:56] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> melee fighting a bear is fine, your sidestep has iframes so just counterattack it
[2:52:00] <+brightman42> so he's still incapable of following the wind
[2:52:01] <%vVAstrAVv> @generalscpatton woolies talked about how he probably wont do a lot of side stuff so with limited upgrades itd be pretty bad lol
[2:52:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> bears are worth it
[2:52:14] <JetpackMcQuack> Bears have good grabs though so watch out
[2:52:21] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ESPECIALLY with a charm
[2:52:28] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> hell the jump has iframes for some reason
[2:52:33] <Shishi1205> FArming Standoffs
[2:52:35] <T_Sasquatch> I still wish i knew who the insane person was that rode a horse for the first time
[2:52:51] <%GeneralSCPatton> @vvastravv Yeah, there's a big difference between going in with maxed sword woolieVS baby sword
[2:52:51] <%vVAstrAVv> i think reggies right it is chrysanthymums
[2:53:06] <%cobalt_phoenix_> 1/75
[2:53:17] <%GeneralSCPatton> 2/75 now
[2:53:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> woops
[2:53:32] <ralphfromdk> Standoff kills give way more per kill as well
[2:53:37] <%vVAstrAVv> 75 what?
[2:53:43] <+brightman42> standoff just fills resolve
[2:53:47] <+brightman42> like all of it
[2:53:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> @vvastravv Headshot challenge for an unlock in Doom Eternal
[2:54:10] <%vVAstrAVv> yeah its a lot of resolve
[2:54:40] <%cobalt_phoenix_> first kill gives 3, then 2, then 1
[2:54:54] <+brightman42> look around
[2:54:59] <+brightman42> oh whatever
[2:55:13] <ralphfromdk> Aaaand he just made it hard on himself :D
[2:55:26] <%GeneralSCPatton> Who needs a vantage point?
[2:55:31] <%vVAstrAVv> does standoff resolve scale with charm and kensei armor?
[2:55:46] <+brightman42> no
[2:55:55] <T_Sasquatch> LUL
[2:55:57] <ralphfromdk> Wow... Woolie is bad at map stuff :o

[2:57:23] <T_Sasquatch> Personally not a fan of treasure hunts
[2:57:26] <+brightman42> it's that incense burner
[2:57:31] <%Andrizzleton> why would woolie think the statue?
[2:57:41] <Shishi1205> Thats a bitch bear

[3:00:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> woolie woolieVS map
[3:00:14] <jaygee303> Hiking with Woolie would be like adding LASO legendary difficulty to a normal nature trail
[3:00:30] <%vVAstrAVv> i used the same logic my first time woolz its ok
[3:00:35] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @jaygee303 sounds like fun
[3:00:37] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> flowers and their big mouths, can't keep secrets
[3:00:37] <%GeneralSCPatton> I'm pretty sure I also read that drawing backwards

[3:05:08] <+solzan2000> change your tune real quick lol
[3:05:23] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WAIFU GET
[3:05:23] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:05:27] <Raldavar> this all could have been avoided if Woolie just stole those pies Honorably so the ghost of his dad-uncle didn't look down at him from heaven with a tear drop in his eye
[3:05:31] <%huskarl_zap> yeah you almost killed me so now you can steal it
[3:05:42] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Hey can I have your number?
[3:05:48] <+jiggy_snipe> she respected your ability to almost kill her
[3:06:02] <%cobalt_phoenix_> what sword kit is that?
[3:06:04] <%huskarl_zap> reggie the femto
[3:06:05] <%BallerSwagBro9k> MIHN HAS ASSIMILATED REGGIE
[3:06:11] <T_Sasquatch> Leave that for later imo
[3:06:19] <%Halospaz117> I think it's supposed to be that no thief would have been able to fight like that, so you must have really been a samurai
[3:06:36] <Raldavar> commit crimes in an honorable fashion to impress girls
[3:07:02] <%huskarl_zap> Woolies hole has never been shut since he was cursed for stealing that pie
[3:07:07] <%vVAstrAVv> my god woolie play nioh already lol
[3:07:11] <T_Sasquatch> Obi wan vs maul is amazing
[3:07:16] <+brightman42> this shrine is OP
[3:07:21] <T_Sasquatch> The final fight
[3:07:36] <%Andrizzleton> Nioh's combat is so good
[3:07:55] <%vVAstrAVv> nioh 2s is even better
[3:07:58] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I'm playing RDR2 right now LUL
[3:08:05] <Shishi1205> Han Solo style
[3:08:05] <%vVAstrAVv> if youve yet to play it
[3:08:12] <%BisoromiBear> he's coming right for us
[3:08:19] <+jiggy_snipe> not murder if its self defense
[3:08:25] <+brightman42> man he loves looking at the ground
[3:08:31] <JetpackMcQuack> Neat
[3:08:31] <+JingKaisean> that sounds cool, but also sounds sus
[3:08:38] <@akuda_bar> it's legal in jersey
[3:08:38] <T_Sasquatch> Nioh as a game series is for masochists
[3:08:45] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Nice legal murder
[3:08:47] <%Andrizzleton> definitely a legend/embellishment
[3:08:57] <%vVAstrAVv> no nioh aint that hard
[3:09:17] <JetpackMcQuack> Like the Han shot first thing haha
[3:09:19] <%vVAstrAVv> theres a lot of items to mitigate the usual soulslike pains
[3:09:31] <+brightman42> it's a skill
[3:09:51] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> I like how average looking everyone looks here but everyone in Nioh is really good looking
[3:09:58] <%huskarl_zap> Americans' right to bear arms isn't in response to someone elses actions thats some revisionist shit.
[3:10:05] <%GeneralSCPatton> Nioh is great. psaBig grind. Spamming shoulder-ram until you can grapple is so satisfying.
[3:10:13] <%vVAstrAVv> yeah nioh is anime lol
[3:10:16] <JetpackMcQuack> legal footsies
[3:10:22] <%vVAstrAVv> noones realistic
[3:10:49] <%huskarl_zap> Duels are legal
[3:10:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> Gun Chicken
[3:11:04] <%Andrizzleton> yeah it's a cool movie thing it's not legit
[3:11:08] <Raldavar> if you want actual Japanese history Nioh has a ton of it separate from the fantasy game lore.
[3:11:16] <%BisoromiBear> fuck that, get bodies
[3:11:23] <%derap41> That's not "wild West" that's gentelm mens england
[3:11:40] <+Razputin217> Need time stop
[3:11:42] <Raldavar> Nioh item and character descriptions are actual pieces of historical lore separate from the high fantasy bullshit
[3:12:00] <%Andrizzleton> gentleman duals are take a pistol stand and point at each other first
[3:12:12] <%vVAstrAVv> and the yokai lore is neat too imo
[3:12:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Canadian Duel pfff LUL
[3:12:39] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1290540030302334977?s=20

[3:12:42] <%huskarl_zap> warthogs coming after woolie
[3:12:46] <Raldavar> yeah lore for days
[3:12:49] <Retinolgaming> Didn't one of the US president's just let the other guy shoot him and just looked at him like he was nothing before popping him? lol
[3:12:50] <@akuda_bar> i've only been thinking of duels lately because i watched hamilton
[3:13:11] <+jiggy_snipe> I think Teddy Roosevelt killed a guy like that
[3:13:17] <%derap41> WAX BULLETS
[3:13:17] <@akuda_bar> sounds like roosevelt
[3:13:38] <@akuda_bar> didn't roosevelt get shot in the chest during a speech and then finish the speech
[3:13:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @akuda_bar He sure did
[3:13:51] <%huskarl_zap> Warthogs hop over the hilltop and start chasing woolie.
[3:13:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Absolute Chad
[3:14:11] <Retinolgaming> Teddy was a Chad's more manly father.
[3:14:20] <%GeneralSCPatton> @akuda_bar I think that was him. The speech he pulled out of his breast pocket was bloodstained
[3:14:20] <T_Sasquatch> Word cancels PogChamp
[3:14:33] <+brightman42> that was close
[3:14:41] <%huskarl_zap> sword through model
[3:14:42] <T_Sasquatch> Standoff on hard difficulty is a real test
[3:14:43] <%vVAstrAVv> act 3s standoffs are pretty tough
[3:14:53] <%Andrizzleton> 20 % skill
[3:15:06] <%vVAstrAVv> everyone said watch their feet but speardudes feet dont even move
[3:15:27] <+brightman42> oh god, this guy sounds horrible in Japanese
[3:15:42] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> spear dudes its the shoulder sway you watch for
[3:15:48] <Shishi1205> Yamato with the big balls
[3:15:55] <%GeneralSCPatton> Of course the Bard knows how to pull a hustle
[3:15:57] <%vVAstrAVv> all thr bad voices are worth it to hear hijikatas voice come out of jin
[3:16:13] <%wunp_fxs> my fav armor
[3:16:20] <%vVAstrAVv> even if the softness of jins english va suits his face more
[3:16:20] <%GeneralSCPatton> Oh my God, Yamato is just a Lore Bard
[3:16:44] <Shishi1205> Headshot go Brrr
[3:16:45] <%wunp_fxs> you can do it right now
[3:16:59] <ralphfromdk> Arrow time!!! It's hella strong
[3:17:09] <%wunp_fxs> its super strong
[3:17:13] <%vVAstrAVv> get it its only a point
[3:17:30] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Yeah archer build is fairly strong
[3:17:35] <%vVAstrAVv> theres no length to increase you cant do it till you spend the point
[3:17:44] <%huskarl_zap> REggie the Hexblade hero
[3:17:47] <%GeneralSCPatton> It's nice as the only stealth option for horsemen with helmets
[3:18:03] <Shishi1205> Yamato noo
[3:18:10] <%GeneralSCPatton> Sometimes you just need to land 3 heavy arrow headshots in bullet time
[3:18:15] <+brightman42> gets legendary archery armor, has a lot of arrows available, fights with sword
[3:18:25] <+brightman42> it'll probably be fine tho
[3:18:34] <raph4_7> check the triangle combo on water stance
[3:18:58] <%vVAstrAVv> archers are weak to sword i did it too lol

[3:21:09] <Breakfast_Megapowers> How is be ancient swordman so far?
[3:21:45] <%GeneralSCPatton> Concentration + half bow is basically the Reflex Shot from Phantom Pain
[3:21:53] <%vVAstrAVv> youll spawn on top of the pit
[3:21:55] <Shishi1205> Thats when you get mega arrowed
[3:21:56] <T_Sasquatch> Go in tho
[3:22:00] <ralphfromdk> That means, "come back later for story stuff"
[3:22:05] <Breakfast_Megapowers> I wonder if ancient people regret not living in a time with Ipods

[3:49:28] <T_Sasquatch> Photo mode is my favorite feature in next gen games
[3:49:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Red Dead Redemption 2 has a good one too
[3:49:45] <penitentpentwitch> Camera Control Level: Divine
[3:49:48] <T_Sasquatch> Literally moving the sun
[3:49:51] <ralphfromdk> I'm pretty sure Sucker Punch made this game with dark magic. It loads soooo fast and you can see so faaaar. Just... how...
[3:50:13] <%GeneralSCPatton> Definitely sorcery
[3:50:17] <%DensityD> good session
[3:50:23] <T_Sasquatch> The Loading makes no sense
[3:50:25] <%vVAstrAVv> its the best so far hands down

[3:51:15] <%vVAstrAVv> its woolies ps4 menus is all
[3:51:16] <Breakfast_Megapowers> @TechGamer it's his PS4 theme
[3:51:24] <+andreocho> what I don't understand does why woolie and pat not have separate steaming schedules? like you guys have cross over. like your taking away from each other views.
[3:51:32] <TechGamer> It's a good theme
[3:51:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> Rusty trigger fumbles are so real
[3:51:53] <ralphfromdk> Shit gets real fun with 3x assassinate in a smoke bomb mid fight :D
[3:52:08] <Breakfast_Megapowers> @andreocho because Pat stream smells, OOOOOOH
[3:52:21] <%vVAstrAVv> @andreocho working around people is hard enough before you factor in 2 peoples schedules as well
[3:52:30] <ralphfromdk> More like... drop you stand.
[3:52:34] <Shishi1205> Gamer genes necesary
[3:52:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> There was no drop your shield. It was drop your stance
[3:52:56] <%cobalt_phoenix_> DASHO
[3:52:59] <%GeneralSCPatton> DOSHO
[3:53:00] <Shishi1205> DASHO
[3:53:01] <@akuda_bar> yeah there's no way to both be streamers without inevitably fighting over the best stream times
[3:53:01] <%ekodrop> Listen to my voice calling you, Calling you out of darkness. Hear the devil's cry of sin,
[3:53:02] <%DensityD> DOSHO
[3:53:11] <ralphfromdk> Archers yell out and you can see their friends ducking when they know arrows are coming
[3:53:28] <+jiggy_snipe> @andreocho I think Woolie views his stream as the live recording for his youtube lps whereas Pat is a streamer 1st. You're not wrong tho
[3:53:36] <%vVAstrAVv> its viable with the audio only but you guys ARE doing an lp so your sounds low i assume
[3:53:38] <%DensityD> x-nauts
[3:53:41] <@akuda_bar> it's like asking, "which of us is gonna be the opener and which of us is gonna be the headliner" @andreocho

[0:15:51] <+soundcloud_raptor> you can do it wooloo!
[0:15:53] <%gatorafan> If you don't GO IN hard enough in Doom you are doing it wrong!
[0:15:54] <Naughta_Noob> If you're ripping their organs out with your bare hands, you're doing it wrong
[0:15:54] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus keep in mind; executions are part-specific. meaning depending on where you look, it targets that body part for execution when available.
[0:15:56] <%WhackyChiraqi> DOOM is kind of akin to Woolie Vs. God
[0:15:57] <+glgzephyr> RIP & TEAR
[0:15:58] <%DesertPenguin> It's like the Rally mechanic in Blodborne
[0:15:59] <chaospudding> what if doom guy was in bloodborne
[0:16:00] <+glgzephyr> TILL IT IS DONE
[0:16:01] <@Cranky_Construct> if a gun isn't firing ever quarter of a second while playing DOOM you're probably doing it wrong
[0:16:02] <b_ikki> navigate the dreads
[0:16:02] <mesamus> ALWAYS MOVE, standing still means death in all situations

[0:31:06] <%Irridium> if you melee them while jumping while their flashing you get a REAL nice stomp
[0:31:06] <Ashenik1> I was hoping Woolie would play thronebreaker but this one is also great
[0:31:07] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus keep in mind; executions are part-specific. meaning depending on where you look, it targets that body part for execution when available.

[0:34:48] <%WhackyChiraqi> "It was worth the risk." [peers over to dead body]
[0:34:50] <CursedNobleman> I've never played Metroid Prime. What makes it a classic?
[0:34:51] <RyuuAoi> When's Woolie VS. Metroid Prime?
[0:34:52] <hntronium> even the moon?
[0:34:52] <%HelghastTroop> you fall enough and he trips XD
[0:34:54] <%DesertPenguin> I can't wait for him to fist bump a DOOMGUY DOLL
[0:34:55] <gustavozxd> are we gonna tell Woolie about the classic gun position?
[0:34:59] <ghostspartan80> don't miss the lore
[0:35:03] <+StooEsq> no fall damage, but there are pits
[0:35:05] <Ropcord> LUL
[0:35:08] <Personified134> this is NOT doomguy for the record
[0:35:10] <JayEarly> cliffs ain’t shit you’re the MOTHAFUCKIN DOOMGUY
[0:35:13] <Personified134> this is the DOOMSLAYER
[0:35:15] <%DesertPenguin> yea
[0:35:15] <serpenttucker> Col. Joson
[0:35:15] <b_ikki> his rabbit
[0:35:21] <%DesertPenguin> DOOM 1 was sent to Mars as punishment

[0:35:21] <serpenttucker> There are demons in the base
[0:35:25] <Andrei11Droasca> Wait, why do i remember this having a double jump ?
[0:35:29] <%DesertPenguin> Double jump is later
[0:35:30] <am_omega> There is no "1st" Doom Guy. Its the same person.
[0:35:31] <%WhackyChiraqi> it does but later
[0:35:32] <Personified134> you get doulbe jump later
[0:35:35] <ItsAGundamu> It has one you get later
[0:35:35] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:35:35] <extradopeness> Yooooo
[0:35:37] <SunPraiser> Andrei11Droasca because it does, just not right now
[0:35:40] <Personified134> this game makes it pretty clear its a different person
[0:35:42] <zamzoph> deepest lore
[0:35:45] <+The_Lunar_Paladin> Eternal is super confirming that this is the original Doomguy
[0:35:46] <$Swish20XX> Doomguy isn't the guy in Doom 3 though, right?
[0:35:50] <%WhackyChiraqi> !MOTIVATED
[0:35:50] <Andrei11Droasca> Ok ,its been a long time LUL
[0:35:50] <@Moobot> 600 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[0:35:51] <BioApple> fun fact: there's a line in the lore that implies all the fan-made doom maps are also canon
[0:35:52] <TheyCallMeVawn> Its the same person
[0:35:58] <am_omega> Nah its the same one.
[0:35:58] <Personified134> eternal is totally retconning it and I don't like that but whatever
[0:35:59] <+Order_of_Mystery> !MOTIVATED
[0:35:59] <$Swish20XX> This game confirms it
[0:36:02] <+Neoepochx> @Personified134 Actually the new stuff from eternal implies that it is the same guy
[0:36:03] <cochramd1992> Doom 1, 2 and 2016 is all the same guy
[0:36:10] <+Neoepochx> In 64 he stays in hell after beating the last boss.
[0:36:10] <%DesertPenguin> Yea
[0:36:11] <%ElectricEmissary> !MOTIVATED
[0:36:12] <Personified134> @Neoepochx yes and thats a retcon
[0:36:13] <SunPraiser> ye 3 is a different guy
[0:36:14] <am_omega> Also yeah all WADs are canon.
[0:36:15] <cochramd1992> also YEEEAAAAAAH DOOM TIME
[0:36:19] <+The_Lunar_Paladin> Reminder that this game is a sequel to Doom 64
[0:36:19] <%DesertPenguin> After 2 they were sick of him so they locked him up
[0:36:23] <jorniev> and then he KILLED HELL TWICE
[0:36:24] <%WhackyChiraqi> the new game shows shots of Doom Guy commanding a fucking HELL ARMY
[0:36:24] <+Neoepochx> @Personified134 Not really.
[0:36:24] <RyuuAoi> Reggie with the loreM
[0:36:27] <TheGershon> Reggie knows this better than I do and I actually play og doom

[0:36:32] <Ashenik1> @DreyfussFrost TBF They allowed ID to scratch CallofDoom4 and make this one. Which is not that common t
[0:36:32] <cochramd1992> @am_omega even HDoom?
[0:36:32] <am_omega> Man Doom 64 is fucking good.
[0:36:34] <zamzoph> and there's a Spider Mastermind or whatever
[0:36:35] <+theAncopro> moons fucked
[0:36:37] <gammongaming11> when did woolie start playing good video games?
[0:36:37] <$Swish20XX> Okay 3 was the only one I wasn't sure about. It just says Doom marine
[0:36:38] <+Neoepochx> They never went ahead and said if he was different in this one.
[0:36:42] <Tennochief> and Hell STILL didn't learn it's lesson
[0:36:44] <%WhackyChiraqi> COOM
[0:36:45] <+Grayhammatter> GET HIM

[0:36:51] <Teyaric> Close - But they locked him up in that sarcophogus
[0:36:53] <+Javaa01> And then he goes BACK to hell to fuck it up AGAIN
[0:36:59] <Ropcord> LUL yup

[0:38:20] <%omenzazu> noooo
[0:38:21] <+spiraljoel> Don't bother with the pistol
[0:38:21] <+ianabstract> The reason there aren't as many demons in this game as there were in other games is he killed so many of them already
[0:38:24] <Ragnaroked_> @Zebroneath its like yelling at the screen in a football game, we know they cant hear us but we do it anyways

[0:39:18] <%allups> FUCK
[0:39:20] <ralphfromdk> Never ever use the pistol unless you are totally out of all ammo. It's so bad compared to the other guns
[0:39:20] <%StrikeTheErf> you'll never use pistol as you keep getting guns
[0:39:22] <am_omega> OH NOOOO
[0:39:23] <Stay_Knight> Ignore pistol

[0:39:58] <SunPraiser> woolieGASM
[0:40:02] <%HelghastTroop> why the fuck would there ever be stealth in a doom game
[0:40:03] <Skeletonmanners> Deadpool game did that
[0:40:05] <Lavrohas> If any game did it, it would be doom
[0:40:06] <SubjectX07x> Stealth kill just turns into him tearing open a demon with a chainsaw.
[0:40:07] <serpenttucker> Sounds like a deadpool gag
[0:40:11] <+BlockingDisabled> The Deadpool game did that
[0:40:15] <Naughta_Noob> This is the character action of FPS, let's be real.
[0:40:21] <$Essixian> @AxelCezar Oh look, it's a man of good taste. squidgameLove

[0:42:03] <MeinKampfyC0uch> charged burst is good too, explosive shot is just *really* good
[0:42:03] <%DesertPenguin> Burst uses more ammo

[0:42:10] <+mashinchaserr> the drone is sad
[0:42:22] <%allups> same burst feels better
[0:42:24] <ShoggothLord> Multishot is sick
[0:42:24] <plushysceptile> The most Christian game available. Because you can't get more holy than killing hell
[0:42:32] <@Solidus_113> the secondary weapon skills have a short cooldown on them
[0:42:37] <gustavozxd> burst just felt lame next to all the other cool shit you can do in the game honestly
[0:42:38] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1224743712657412096?s=19
[0:42:39] <%WhackyChiraqi> this is an Old Testament level ass-beating.
[0:42:42] <%DesertPenguin> Try the glory kills while looking at different parts of the enemy. The legs, from behind, from above, etc.
[0:42:45] <SubjectX07x> Nothing more holy than a jolly crusade through the deepest circles of hell.
[0:42:52] <DeathByPoke7> we are going full controller no weirdo hybrid set up
[0:42:56] <TheyCallMeVawn> Dont forget you have infinite grenades
[0:42:58] <%HelghastTroop> @plushysceptile its christen game becasue it shows off how fuckin metal hell and demons are
[0:43:02] <Varadox> I wish it was the Hybrid setup.
[0:43:05] <%WhackyChiraqi> Doomslayer seems like Old Testament God would have made him
[0:43:06] <SilverInferno3> Don't be afraid to turn up the sensitivity
[0:43:11] <@Solidus_113> your map will show you a lot of the secrets

[0:43:28] <zamzoph> R&T in moderation SeemsGood
[0:43:28] <BioApple> leave no corner unripped
[0:43:28] <Tennochief> The Bible in Doom is hardcore
[0:43:29] <%HelghastTroop> doom is basically banjo kazooie
[0:43:30] <+theAncopro> Rip Tear and Care
[0:43:32] <+SirGO0SE> the rippin and the tearin the rippin and the tearin

[0:43:46] <%WhackyChiraqi> @HelghastTroop they hated him because he spoke the truth
[0:43:46] <SubjectX07x> Bingo.
[0:43:47] <+YabbaTroll> @ManaSpurt why? >:(
[0:43:48] <%HelghastTroop> but banjo replaces kazooie with a 12 gauge
[0:43:50] <Andrei11Droasca> Doom guy is basically Samus
[0:43:56] <JayEarly> Pretty much every weapon mod selection is like yeah that’s neat but this one is WAY COOLER
[0:43:58] <Ashenik1> CHECK THE MAP
[0:43:59] <mankeymania> RIP with care
[0:44:01] <%DesertPenguin> No hard progress here you can walk back to the very beginning of every level (Except Argent Tower)
[0:44:05] <gunsrlove> @WoolieVersus In most levels you can explore and backtrack the level pretty much entirely, as long as there are no locked doors, especially when you get double jump
[0:44:10] <+Javaa01> Double Jump is in like 3 levels
[0:44:14] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Teyaric
[0:44:14] <Varadox> @WoolieVersus You will know exactly what hard progress is. Because it's largely moving forward.
[0:44:15] <+SirGO0SE> doom guy is basically your grandpa in a speedo on spring break
[0:44:15] <cochramd1992> woolie you almost had it
[0:44:15] <%WhackyChiraqi> Doom guy is basically Sam Porter Bridges if you think about it
[0:44:18] <%allups> its level based so as long as you don't leave the level ur good
[0:44:18] <%DesertPenguin> Argent Tower has that crazy ending though
[0:44:20] <plushysceptile> Classic levels though
[0:44:21] <J87_fox> secret back where you almost blew yourself up
[0:44:28] <Rosswelle> @WoolieVersus why do you think they call him the Doombringer? is it because he has DOOMS? LUL
[0:44:30] <$Swish20XX> I hope everyone just enjoys this and doesn't try and make Woolie feel like shit because he isn't a god at fps games
[0:44:33] <alrobot2014> @Teyaric congrats!

[0:47:05] <%DesertPenguin> yea
[0:47:06] <SubjectX07x> It's labeled equipment because later you get things that aren't necessarily grenades in the same slot.
[0:47:07] <@Solidus_113> RIP
[0:47:08] <cacophanes> @Essixian is H-DOOM what I think it is?

[0:47:27] <%DesertPenguin> BJ Blaskowitz is Doomguy's great great grandchild?
[0:47:30] <Ceroical> I'm guessing Woolie doesn't play FPS much?
[0:47:36] <ghostspartan80> nah
[0:47:37] <SubjectX07x> @cacophanes Yes.
[0:47:37] <%HelghastTroop> that family tree got deep roots

[0:47:44] <Maids4lyfe> psaDab
[0:47:51] <+Javaa01> @cacophanes It's exactly what it says on the tin, and lets just say that "finishers" in that work a little differently
[0:47:52] <%WhackyChiraqi> Woolie plays punch games, so this is a pretty good place to start w FPS.
[0:48:01] <+paladinstarbuster> @DesertPenguin other way around
[0:48:01] <JayEarly> @desertpenguin other way around
[0:48:09] <JayEarly> jinx
[0:48:10] <Chimeraelite> oh shit
[0:48:13] <cacophanes> im sorry i asked what H-DOOM is
[0:48:14] <ghostspartan80> SnailDoom confirmed?
[0:48:15] <cacophanes> or am i
[0:48:16] <spiderously> BJ is Doom guy's great grandfather, and Commander Keen is his grandfather.
[0:48:16] <$Essixian> @HelghastTroop seewaaG squidgameLewd cuppyGasm
[0:48:22] <SubjectX07x> @Javaa01 Glory kills more like Gloryhole kills
[0:48:24] <Varadox> It's exactly what it says on the tin. H-Doom.
[0:48:24] <%allups> getting them on the right color changes what drops
[0:48:25] <Chimeraelite> H Doom is a treasure, don't you forget it
[0:48:46] <%GraceTBM> look at a different part of the enemy to do a different glory kill
[0:48:48] <%WhackyChiraqi> you know how mad you gotta be to punch a MF in the BACK
[0:48:51] <Varadox> Stop using shotgun blases on the little guys.
[0:48:54] <%HelghastTroop> HDOOM, for those that are lovers instead of fighters Kappa
[0:48:56] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus if you aim your camera at different angles you can get different glory kills
[0:48:57] <Varadox> *blasts
[0:48:57] <+thackattack00> hdoom Kreygasm
[0:48:57] <%WhackyChiraqi> you ever been punched in the back??
[0:49:00] <SunPraiser> thank you universe
[0:49:09] <%allups> he loves sody pop
[0:49:09] <plushysceptile> IIRC, the line was BJ is great grandpa, Keen is grandpa, Doom guy is current end
[0:49:14] <%GeneralSCPatton> Cheer500 You absolutely can regrind levels offscreen for collectables, and practice. I expect several hours of labbing that shoot-punch-glory kill tech so you can DO BIG NUMBER COMBO
[0:49:17] <%GeneralSCPatton> GeneralSCPatton's Cheer shared rewards to 10 others in Chat! 
[0:49:17] <cacophanes> so it's established that Commander Keen FUCKS
[0:49:21] <worldbrand> But where does this fit into the Hoopz Barkley SaGa?
[0:49:22] <+theotherkristian> When you look at real shotguns shooting plates in the air, shotgun in games make almost zero sens3
[0:49:30] <am_omega> Keen does have two kids.
[0:49:33] <spiderously> frames?
[0:49:40] <%allups> ofc he does have u seen him @cacophanes

[0:49:42] <%WhackyChiraqi> OH MAN I GOOGLED HDOOM don't do that uh oh
[0:49:45] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus keep in mind; executions are part-specific. meaning depending on where you look, it targets that body part for execution when available.
[0:49:47] <SilverInferno3> Remember to never stop moving!
[0:49:48] <+kraajkase> this is nothing

[0:50:32] <%Irridium> ii think I can reliably guess what H doom is
[0:50:33] <@Solidus_113> woolieMIRIN
[0:50:33] <Apollo1818> @desertpenguin iD did say that Bloodborne was constantly being played during development.
[0:50:37] <Varadox> Don't look up Doom.wads then. You'll have a trip.

[0:51:34] <+thackattack00> hdoom is also about going in and never stopping going in LUL
[0:51:35] <%WhackyChiraqi> playing H Doom gives you DOOMS
[0:51:43] <SilverInferno3> Orange is used
[0:51:44] <+Javaa01> Any place that's gray is worth going to
[0:51:45] <thesoothe> HDoom is a mod, it does "things", i'm not saying nothing mroe.
[0:51:45] <Teyaric> Orange means collected
[0:51:46] <StonerStan101> @WoolieVersus Having fun fighting as the most Christian character in gaming?
[0:51:46] <%Irridium> the red ones you got already
[0:51:47] <Djinnazz> no, that's used.
[0:51:48] <mikesapartment> orange = got
[0:51:48] <SilverInferno3> Gray is unfound
[0:51:49] <am_omega> Not at work though.

[0:51:55] <@Menitta> yup that's what I thought it was. time to ban
[0:51:55] <$Essixian> @thackattack00 Oh shit you're so right
[0:51:55] <+Shikari21> orange is you found it
[0:51:56] <FuqBoiSlim> if all the WADs are canon does that mean Sonic Robo Blast 2 canon?
[0:51:58] <+Grayhammatter> orange means got
[0:51:58] <buerdo> Cool secret in this area
[0:51:59] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus there was a side path you missed up against cliff side where you drop kicked an imp in the face when you dropped down
[0:52:00] <%K2YP70C0CK> Lunge N Plunge
[0:52:02] <+Javaa01> But there is still an upgrade left to get on this level
[0:52:05] <@Solidus_113> everything in white on the map you missed
[0:52:07] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus grey means you haven't been there yet
[0:52:09] <Lavrohas> still an elite guard upgrade
[0:52:10] <gustavozxd> chat saving the day for once
[0:52:11] <am_omega> @FuqBoiSlim Yes, its all canon
[0:52:14] <Lavrohas> dont miss those
[0:52:22] <SilverInferno3> You can get a suit upgrade that'll show most of the hidden stuff
[0:52:23] <@Solidus_113> there are many secret corners
[0:52:25] <Varadox> Remember. All DOOM WADS are canon.
[0:52:26] <MyNameIsRasus> Gray means you didn't go there
[0:52:30] <+GarbageNirvana> Oh wait isn't there a thing here
[0:52:31] <Lavrohas> def go back and explore, its a very short sidepath
[0:52:32] <Andrei11Droasca> Orange = got ,white = get
[0:52:35] <Varadox> So this means that Doomguy has killed Shrek.
[0:52:36] <spiderously> white stuff?
[0:52:38] <%HelghastTroop> somany screts lost
[0:52:39] <Varadox> In another dimension.

[0:52:49] <%HelghastTroop> but thats the life we choose to live
[0:52:50] <%WhackyChiraqi> Shrek is an SCP
[0:52:51] <+nekodelic> is Mihn gone forever?
[0:52:53] <$Essixian> @Varadox Every. Single. One.

[0:55:30] <Vyneci> Not "or" Woolie, "AND"
[0:55:35] <%WhackyChiraqi> isn't the praetor armor canonically YOURS? so like, this eternally old freakish kill-monster CANONICALLY has a built-in Style Meter?
[0:55:36] <@Solidus_113> yes
[0:55:36] <MyNameIsRasus> Duty Shooter 5
[0:55:39] <+Shikari21> Yes
[0:55:39] <Tucker0603> yep
[0:55:40] <%DesertPenguin> You have to do them all
[0:55:40] <Ceroical> Woolie! If you get a chance on foundry! Jump into the laav!
[0:55:40] <SubjectX07x> Yes
[0:55:41] <MyNameIsRasus> yes
[0:55:43] <Lavrohas> yes its mission based. its per mission.
[0:55:43] <+Javaa01> That's the total for the level
[0:55:43] <+Shikari21> its in the level
[0:55:44] <Ceroical> *Lava
[0:55:44] <%Irridium> yeah that's all the map secrets
[0:55:52] <Tucker0603> EXPLORE TO KILL BETTER
[0:55:58] <+Grayhammatter> find all 8 for more loot
[0:56:01] <%GeneralSCPatton> CHALLENGES ARE PER MISSION
[0:56:03] <+DreyfussFrost> 5 *different* glory kills.
[0:56:08] <SilverInferno3> Yes
[0:56:08] <mikesapartment> yes
[0:56:09] <%DesertPenguin> There are no visual upgrades sorry
[0:56:10] <Stay_Knight> Suit looks the same
[0:56:11] <+thackattack00> yes
[0:56:12] <%Irridium> oh yes
[0:56:12] <+McSoliace> yes
[0:56:12] <thesoothe> The upgrade that shows secrets is the most baffling upgrade ever.
[0:56:13] <+paladinstarbuster> you can se his face there too huh
[0:56:14] <%Irridium> lab that shit
[0:56:14] <zamzoph> @WoolieVersus Read us the lore!
[0:56:14] <%Solidnick18> Yes
[0:56:16] <@Solidus_113> You'll want to go through these maps again off screen to clean up missed secrets and unlock more weapon skills
[0:56:16] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus you can replay per mission to get missions. they stay between missions/playthroughs iirc
[0:56:16] <+Javaa01> From the menu, yes
[0:56:18] <Skeletonmanners> yea theres a level select
[0:56:22] <TheGershon> that'd be fucked up if you couldn't
[0:56:30] <Monkey_D_Judd> Yes
[0:56:37] <KaseKaizer> also if you die challenge progress is still maintained
[0:56:38] <Snakes_dk> true
[0:56:39] <$Essixian> @WhackyChiraqi Well no, it's not there by default. However, VEGA gives you the Style Meter, which means VEGA is the most clued-in, on-board motherfucker in the universe.
[0:56:41] <ghostspartan80> No visual changes on the suit lol
[0:56:42] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[0:56:47] <SilverInferno3> Oh boy wait till the rune that lets you glory kill from a mile away
[0:56:51] <+Javaa01> Oh you ain't seen shit if you thing THAT is teleporting
[0:56:51] <+Order_of_Mystery> yeah, and you keep weapons and abilities when you replay
[0:56:53] <MyNameIsRasus> Nice
[0:56:54] <+spiraljoel> You can get an upgrade later that lets you launch into a glory kill from long distance
[0:56:55] <plushysceptile> Have to put a bit of effort into exploring. Too much to find, even finding weapons early in some
[0:57:08] <%Exiliator> Low power? Do we need to sacrefice another baby?
[0:57:10] <gustavozxd> grinding off screen huh
[0:57:15] <%WhackyChiraqi> @Essixian VEGA watched the UAC facility go down in flames, and much like Sparda, he AWOKE to STYLE
[0:57:40] <SubjectX07x> So, real talk, what is chats favorite rune upgrades? Mine are faster glory kills, glory kill speed boost and Longer Range Glory Kills
[0:57:41] <CureMode666> the power demands a sacrifice
[0:57:43] <ghostspartan80> theres really no need to grind off screen in this game
[0:57:45] <+spiraljoel> When you fully level the long distance glory kill rune it's pretty much Vergil Ground Trick
[0:57:45] <am_omega> Doomslayer will be maxed the fuck out "So I did a little grinding"
[0:57:46] <+Javaa01> It is, but you need power FIRST
[0:57:48] <+SirGO0SE> GROUND BEEF
[0:57:58] <JayEarly> favorite upgrade is air control
[0:58:04] <SilverInferno3> @SubjectX07x Rich get Richer and fully upgraded Micro Missles are the best

[0:58:31] <FuqBoiSlim> ResidentSleeper okay
[0:58:38] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus lore is optional. you can braindead your way throug the game and RP doomslayer, or read and listen. its honestly pretty rad as FUCK lore

[1:03:46] <+SirGO0SE> HEY DO YOU LIKE VIDEO GAMES
[1:03:47] <+Shikari21> Hes dead :(
[1:03:51] <StonerStan101> @WoolieVersus And there are eight of these.
[1:03:56] <%Irridium> one in every level. good luck!
[1:03:58] <+The_Lunar_Paladin> And you can play the whole level in the main menu!
[1:04:03] <$Swish20XX> ^
[1:04:05] <%Solidnick18> that's it
[1:04:10] <RyuuAoi> WE IN THERE
[1:04:11] <%WhackyChiraqi> where's the level that takes you to the shitty Commander Keen mobile game?
[1:04:16] <+DreyfussFrost> There was one in the previous level you missed too.
[1:04:28] <delta278899> There's an easter egg if you die right?
[1:04:32] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus check out that FLAT LIGHTING
[1:04:35] <a_mad_dragon> what would REALLY be crazy is if a wolfenstein level was hidden in one of the classic doom areas
[1:04:35] <%Irridium> in the lava yeah
[1:04:41] <SubjectX07x> Also if you know the old secrets from og DOOM you can get even more out of it.
[1:04:41] <Ceroical> @delta278899 Yeah, if you fall in lava
[1:04:49] <am_omega> @delta278899 Depends on how you die but there are a ton.
[1:04:53] <SubjectX07x> If I'm not mistaken.
[1:04:53] <+Corporate_Redeemer> Please let Woolie jump into and die in the lava
[1:04:58] <SilverInferno3> DONT UPGRADE PISTOL
[1:05:08] <am_omega> From Lava to seeing the old Doomguy face.
[1:05:14] <%omenzazu> jump kill dammit lmao
[1:05:17] <JayEarly> never upgrade pistol
[1:05:19] <%WhackyChiraqi> The Starting Pistol is actually one of the best weapons in the game when upgraded.
[1:05:20] <@Solidus_113> choose what you want
[1:05:24] <@Menitta> the pistol is worthless
[1:05:25] <%Solidnick18> pistol sucks
[1:05:26] <%Soulbishop> This is the perfect example of why people stream it brings back that all nostalgic feeling of couch co-op with your friend or just playing a game with your friend watching
[1:05:27] <+SirGO0SE> big boomer energy
[1:05:27] <+kira2993> jump + GLORY kill
[1:05:31] <%Solidnick18> big guns are best
[1:05:31] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus saving upgrade points for the weapons/mods you want is a very legit strat btw
[1:05:37] <DeathByPoke7> pistol is already obsolete
[1:05:38] <%omenzazu> aim at different limbs when gory kills
[1:05:39] <$Swish20XX> It is true but yeah
[1:05:40] <NickHatesSnow> pistol is only worth itwhen everything is maxed
[1:05:55] <FuqBoiSlim> oh like cave story then
[1:05:55] <spooksy> god the mastery system is so cool
[1:05:58] <%WhackyChiraqi> [DOOM LP on channel] Me: Instant Load
[1:05:59] <%omenzazu> pistol is only worth it to do that challenge honestly
[1:06:01] <+Corporate_Redeemer> Pistol is only good for weakening zombies for glory kills but your melee is good enough
[1:06:01] <+Mkingston> nobody uses the pistol. this is why the shotgun is the base gun in Eternal
[1:06:01] <%Irridium> yes the garbage you were right
[1:06:03] <BioApple> the garbage is pistol
[1:06:03] <+Mumbles519> the garbage LUL
[1:06:11] <$Swish20XX> It's only for when you have no ammo
[1:06:12] <+Neoepochx> There is a reason there is no pistol in Eternal
[1:06:14] <%DesertPenguin> STILL USELESS
[1:06:18] <SilverInferno3> It's like 9 points to fully upgrade yeah?
[1:06:20] <am_omega> Pistol is for when you somehow fucked up and are out of ammo.
[1:06:20] <Ashenik1> LUL
[1:06:22] <+YabbaTroll> upgrade last
[1:06:23] <%omenzazu> still butt
[1:06:25] <Lavrohas> pistol maxed is FANTASTIC.. I played through ultra nightmare with it. trust me.
[1:06:26] <ArkhamBenji> Fully upgraded pistol is still trash
[1:06:28] <+Javaa01> THE LOWEST PRIORITY
[1:06:30] <Lavrohas> but untill then dont bother
[1:06:30] <+Corporate_Redeemer> Know your place, TRASH
[1:06:34] <KaseKaizer> ehhhh... "worth" is a bit generous
[1:06:34] <MeinKampfyC0uch> there's a challenge later on using the Pistol, and it's decent for just taking out Possessed without wasting ammo, but yeah
[1:06:37] <RunningNGunning> Its the same as other DOOM games, as soon as you get another gun, the pistol is useless
[1:06:41] <NickHatesSnow> good mentality woolie
[1:06:47] <%omenzazu> hell that shotgun takes a back seat to the super shotgun
[1:06:52] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[1:06:55] <+paladinstarbuster> PUNCH LASERS
[1:06:55] <+ianabstract> feedin demons the curb
[1:07:00] <@Solidus_113> long range shotgun
[1:07:03] <worldbrand> it's kinda funny, pistol weapons tend to be really reliable in games where you can upgrade them
[1:07:04] <MyNameIsRasus> JUMP AND GLORY KILL FOR HYPE
[1:07:07] <Shishi1205> jump execute for dank new animations
[1:07:15] <+Grayhammatter> a lot
[1:07:16] <%Solidnick18> a few
[1:07:17] <DeathByPoke7> all i want from doom eternal is a suplex
[1:07:18] <SubjectX07x> At least 5
[1:07:21] <+ianabstract> Jump, aim at the leg
[1:07:23] <SubjectX07x> But more like... 8-10
[1:07:23] <SilverInferno3> Yeah there's air kills
[1:07:25] <NickHatesSnow> one for each limb
[1:07:26] <worldbrand> more than 5 and less than 1 million
[1:07:26] <+ianabstract> you unlock more too
[1:07:26] <+ComradePenguin> does woolie know that the glory kills are body part sensitive?
[1:07:27] <RyuuAoi> Don't upgrade until you get the Red 9! Wait...wrong Super Beaster.
[1:07:31] <+Kqha4000> Aiming at the legs will do different kills
[1:07:36] <jorniev> MORE TAHN ONE IS TOO MANY
[1:07:39] <Lavrohas> @ComradePenguin yeah
[1:07:40] <%Solidnick18> SURE CAN
[1:07:41] <+Javaa01> One from above, one for each limb and head and one for the chest from the front and back, along with wallsplats
[1:07:42] <%WhackyChiraqi> @DeathByPoke7 honestly, if the Glory Kill for the Vergil in that game is a suplex ... aw man
[1:07:44] <+ComradePenguin> kk
[1:07:46] <Shishi1205> yeeyeyeyeeyeyey

[1:09:16] <+liquidzr0> did woolie play gears of war?
[1:09:19] <RyuuAoi> So why not ALWAYS use the chainsaw?!
[1:09:20] <spiderously> jump
[1:09:20] <%GeneralSCPatton> SAVE FOR BIG DEMON AND LOW AMMO!
[1:09:20] <Varadox> No.
[1:09:21] <Tennochief> NO MERCY
[1:09:23] <aero160h> crouch, jump on them, go to the sides, go behind to get different glory kills
[1:09:24] <$Swish20XX> What difficulty is it?
[1:09:30] <MeinKampfyC0uch> Hurt Me Plenty
[1:09:30] <SilverInferno3> Normal
[1:09:33] <JayEarly> @ryuuaoi limited fuel
[1:09:37] <Varadox> You can't always use the chainsaw because it's limited in fuel.
[1:09:38] <$Swish20XX> Cool cool
[1:09:39] <@Solidus_113> do the air melee when they're glowing
[1:09:41] <jorniev> MONEY SHOT
[1:09:45] <+nekodelic> @liquidzr0 dunno, but he should play Gears Pop
[1:09:46] <am_omega> You got that upgrade.
[1:09:47] <+DreyfussFrost> @swish20xx Bitch mode
[1:09:48] <ZockerKauz> Chainsaw kills mean enemies become ammo piniatas instead of health
[1:09:51] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus aerial glory kill gets easier to execute after you get double kill.
[1:09:53] <%omenzazu> did I miss the jump gory kill?
[1:09:56] <%allups> chain saw managements
[1:09:57] <Varadox> Nope.
[1:09:58] <%wujak> you got the shotgun multi kill point
[1:10:01] <RyuuAoi> @jayearly DAMN DAMN DAMN
[1:10:05] <ghostspartan80> save the chainsaw for ammo
[1:10:06] <+liquidzr0> @nekodelic i feel like he would appreciate the carnage
[1:10:13] <Varadox> He has yet to do a jump kill.
[1:10:14] <eldrich_horror> whats the difficulty?
[1:10:16] <%omenzazu> I just stepped out to help my pops
[1:10:20] <+Shikari21> Here it comes PepeLaugh
[1:10:24] <@Solidus_113> he completed it
[1:10:25] <%wujak> you just got that one
[1:10:25] <%omenzazu> @varadox thanks man lol
[1:10:30] <SilverInferno3> He just got it so it's fine
[1:10:30] <KaseKaizer> he got it in the last fight
[1:10:32] <%WhackyChiraqi> he got the point
[1:10:35] <@Solidus_113> follow the lights Woolie
[1:10:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> 2 ZOMBOS/POSSESSED
[1:10:39] <am_omega> He got it though.
[1:10:40] <SubjectX07x> Nononono
[1:10:42] <MyNameIsRasus> He just got it
[1:10:42] <@Solidus_113> the big light
[1:10:43] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:10:44] <+Neoepochx> A good thing about this game is that you can go back to each level no problem.
[1:10:47] <+Grayhammatter> you just got the point
[1:10:48] <Ceroical> @WoolieVersus You've already finished those two
[1:10:49] <SubjectX07x> Don't get in the way of that, it will kill you.
[1:10:57] <+SirGO0SE> operation SNEAKY SNEAKS
[1:10:57] <deviljhojho_> ah yes, the classic doom sneaking
[1:10:58] <%WhackyChiraqi> Wait ... why is there a chainsaw on Mars in the first place?
[1:11:01] <ghostspartan80> btw green lights mark where you need to go
[1:11:06] <ZockerKauz> the red bar underneath your weapon is chainsaw fuel.
[1:11:06] <+Shikari21> He had it way before
[1:11:08] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus saving upgrade points for the weapons/mods you want is a very legit strat btw
[1:11:10] <%chronoxgp> terraforming?
[1:11:13] <MeinKampfyC0uch> @WhackyChiraqi The weapon description actually touches on that
[1:11:15] <%Solidnick18> i wish
[1:11:16] <Ceroical> No sadly
[1:11:19] <SilverInferno3> Numbers Woolie!
[1:11:19] <tiaramaki> Just imagine
[1:11:19] <+Neoepochx> So it has a lot of replayability and is not too bad for completionists.
[1:11:21] <RunningNGunning> You can't upgrade perfection @WoolieVersus
[1:11:22] <+theAncopro> B I G chain
[1:11:25] <resloxxx> Tetanus will make them wish for death
[1:11:28] <+trekkie11041> @WoolieVersus chainsaw is just a delete button for ammo
[1:11:30] <%WhackyChiraqi> @MeinKampfyC0uch "we know there are no trees but we heard the doom slayer likes them"?
[1:11:33] <+Shikari21> crouch
[1:11:33] <%Irridium> no that's the way
[1:11:37] <RyuuAoi> MAJE IT LOUDER
[1:11:51] <RyuuAoi> MAKE
[1:11:55] <@Solidus_113> save it for low ammo
[1:12:03] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus save that chainsaw for BIG DEMONS.
[1:12:03] <SilverInferno3> Remember, the bigger the enemy, the more fuel needed
[1:12:10] <MeinKampfyC0uch> @WhackyChiraqi Pretty much that it has no reason to be there other than for a "weapon enthusiast"
[1:12:11] <$Swish20XX> Don't get smushed
[1:12:13] <+Shikari21> LUL
[1:12:14] <SilverInferno3> It's also an instant kill
[1:12:14] <CoffeeSlice> LUL
[1:12:17] <+ianabstract> There's a secret weapon unlock in this area
[1:12:21] <%Irridium> shoulda gone the other way LUL
[1:12:21] <bronzeaxe> there is a super shotgun early in this level
[1:12:24] <jorniev> TURN THE CHAINSAW INTO A SONG
[1:12:36] <%WhackyChiraqi> @MeinKampfyC0uch this a research base on MARS! during an ENERGY CRISIS!
[1:12:40] <spiderously> GET DOORED
[1:12:44] <+Shikari21> down
[1:12:44] <+Javaa01> Yeah, you can unlock the next stage's weapon a stage early each time through a secret
[1:12:45] <ghostspartan80> don't miss the plasma rifle
[1:12:46] <derap41> Doom with a controller .... ew
[1:12:49] <SilverInferno3> Other way
[1:12:53] <clamlamity> stop hiding
[1:12:54] <Shishi1205> check map when doubting
[1:12:54] <%Irridium> other way. down low
[1:12:57] <$Swish20XX> Super shotgun?
[1:12:58] <clamlamity> rip and tear
[1:13:02] <bronzeaxe> WET ZOMBIE THROAT NOISES
[1:13:08] <SilverInferno3> There ya go
[1:13:09] <bronzeaxe> yee
[1:13:11] <%EpsilonDSC> it can be two stages early like with the rocket launcher
[1:13:17] <ghostspartan80> follow the green lights
[1:13:19] <Ceroical> Jump
[1:13:21] <%WhackyChiraqi> like imagine if we wasted a million dollars and tons of fuel shipping some dude's gundam figurine to Mars cause he likes them
[1:13:24] <deviljhojho_> oh baby
[1:13:26] <NickHatesSnow> both legs have different ones
[1:13:27] <%Solidnick18> jump
[1:13:28] <Varadox> I feel like playing RE4.
[1:13:29] <%Solidnick18> damn it
[1:13:35] <RyuuAoi> Why was Doom 3 scary? Like hard to play scary...was that just me?
[1:13:37] <+Shikari21> the jump is odd
[1:13:37] <%GeneralSCPatton> Doom 3 justifies the chainsaw as a fucked up shipment that was supposed to be jackhammers
[1:13:38] <@Solidus_113> WHAT'S A RELOAD???
[1:13:39] <+thackattack00> there is no reload

[1:14:05] <%WhackyChiraqi> no reload - CHAINSAW BUTTON
[1:14:06] <%EpsilonDSC> BECAUSE THIS IS A GOOD GAME
[1:14:07] <bronzeaxe> reloading is for people who cant fist fuck demons
[1:14:09] <SilverInferno3> Boy anti-capslock is not made for streams of this game lol
[1:14:10] <%WhackyChiraqi> no reload - BFG BUTTON THO
[1:14:21] <%Exiliator> For a second I heard "Demonic Christmas" LUL
[1:14:21] <@Menitta> man Doom 3 is unfortunate.
[1:14:26] <+SirGO0SE> big scary though
[1:14:31] <NickHatesSnow> Doom 3 is good just not a good Doom
[1:14:34] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Doom 3 is cool nowadays, they fixed a lot
[1:14:37] <+thesyndrome> I still like Doom 3, but it's not a good doom game
[1:14:38] <bronzeaxe> also always go for glory kills it gets you weapon upgrade pnts fastee
[1:14:40] <Lavrohas> I honestly like doom 3. its just not like the rest of them
[1:14:40] <RunningNGunning> Doom 3 is a fine game, its just doesnt feel like DOOM
[1:14:43] <%EpsilonDSC> DOOM 3 IS A GOOD GAME IT IS JUST NOT A DOOM GAME
[1:14:43] <+Shikari21> I like doom 3 personally
[1:14:45] <+Javaa01> It's fully dynamically lit
[1:14:45] <%EpsilonDSC> FIGHT ME
[1:14:46] <+Neoepochx> There are things I like about Doom 3, but it isn't that fun compared to the other games.
[1:14:49] <Personified134> its STILL pretty impressive
[1:14:54] <+Grayhammatter> you are
[1:14:55] <ISkyHunterI> SourPls
[1:14:57] <xiccy> Doom 3 was fantastic fuck y'all
[1:14:59] <%Solidnick18> SourPls
[1:14:59] <@Solidus_113> nidhogg hatchlings
[1:15:00] <+Javaa01> But the level design sucked, so that kinda killed it
[1:15:04] <%DesertPenguin> yea same noise too
[1:15:05] <$Swish20XX> It feels like F.E.A.R.
[1:15:05] <ghostspartan80> audio logs in that games are good
[1:15:07] <+Corporate_Redeemer> Imagine DOOMGUY in DMC tho
[1:15:08] <@Squdnate> DOOM 3 IS A SUPER GOOD GAME STILL. It was just not *Doom*, but it spearheaded a lot of tech that is still used today
[1:15:09] <sasparillatango> doom3 was fun with the flashlight mod
[1:15:14] <acedeone> hi all
[1:15:19] <Naughta_Noob> Doom 3 is nice, but it's biggest problem is being called Doom
[1:15:25] <acedeone> is this going to be a full lp?
[1:15:29] <+SirGO0SE> i loved my hello kitty flashlight
[1:15:29] <Flarepulse> the Devil May Cry because he is scared
[1:15:32] <@Menitta> I dont like Doom 3
[1:15:33] <Djinnazz> @WoolieVersus You have a weapon wheel.
[1:15:40] <RunningNGunning> Doom 3 is the DmC of DOOM games
[1:15:44] <%Solidnick18> SourPls
[1:15:44] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus I see you reggie with that Nirvana reference <3
[1:15:46] <+Taglog7> SwiftRage SingsNote
[1:15:48] <DeathByPoke7> Doom may cry
[1:15:49] <Andrei11Droasca> It tried to be a serious horror thing but you were do OP it failed
[1:15:49] <SilverInferno3> YEYEYE
[1:15:49] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> Doom 3 shoulda been called "Spooky scary space shooty"
[1:15:50] <+ianabstract> GOOMBA STOMP
[1:15:50] <@Solidus_113> woolieGASM
[1:15:50] <+Shikari21> NICE
[1:15:51] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:15:51] <SainEdge> PogChamp
[1:15:52] <tiaramaki> YEYEYE

[1:15:52] <worldbrand> YEYEYEYEYE
[1:15:54] <CoffeeSlice> LUL
[1:15:54] <%Exiliator> woolieSHOOK woolieYE
[1:15:56] <+Neoepochx> HE IS BEGINNING TO BELIEVE
[1:16:01] <@Squdnate> @RunningNGunning Not even close. That's the SNES version of Doom 1
[1:16:04] <jorniev> SO THAT IS HOW MARIO FEELS
[1:16:07] <@Squdnate> That was a major mess
[1:16:11] <%WhackyChiraqi> @Neoepochx lmaoooo
[1:16:12] <RyuuAoi> NOICE
[1:16:14] <SubjectX07x> You can force it too while on the same plane if you do it at the top of a jump.
[1:16:22] <RyuuAoi> @jorniev EXACTLY
[1:16:36] <%Solidnick18> hell yeah
[1:16:39] <@Squdnate> also the next LP of another Doom game should be HDoom
[1:16:41] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> SNAP THAT DEMON ARM
[1:16:42] <+Javaa01> The weapon wheel slows down time, use it on controller since you can't just press the button for the gun you want
[1:16:42] <%Solidnick18> ooof
[1:16:46] <N1netbattler> Doom guy for smash when????
[1:16:50] <RunningNGunning> @Squdnate What I meant was that its an okay game on its own, its biggest problem was that it was called DmC/ DOOM and not its own thing
[1:16:53] <+mmack093> Has woolie never played Doom 2016 before?
[1:16:58] <Varadox> Nope.
[1:16:58] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus save that chainsaw for BIG DEMONS.
[1:16:58] <+Grayhammatter> big goops
[1:16:59] <+Shikari21> He hasnt
[1:17:00] <Cabba> nope
[1:17:00] <@Solidus_113> nope
[1:17:00] <%Solidnick18> coated in demon blood
[1:17:00] <+Neoepochx> nope
[1:17:07] <%Exiliator> Cleanup crew to factory hall 7
[1:17:09] <ZockerKauz> I want doomguy and dante for smash SO BAAAD NotLikeThis
[1:17:09] <%WhackyChiraqi> no - but he's been preparing for it all of his life
[1:17:11] <+Taglog7> Are the demons real? Kappa
[1:17:11] <JayEarly> I’m DOOMguy and reloading is for bitches
[1:17:12] <%EpsilonDSC> I mean, Woolie does get motion sick
[1:17:14] <+Mkingston> DOOM 2016 isn't a FPS. It's a rhythm game.
[1:17:14] <%Irridium> gonna wanna go down low
[1:17:15] <@Solidus_113> The map is showing you all the secret
[1:17:20] <@Solidus_113> it's real big
[1:17:20] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus aerial glory kill gets easier to execute after you get double jump.
[1:17:20] <RyuuAoi> @mmack093 I don't believe so. Matt and Pat did before.
[1:17:20] <+Grayhammatter> little bit of up
[1:17:21] <jorniev> he just turned like 50 demons into paint
[1:17:23] <+Corporate_Redeemer> They aren't running to get a tactical advantage. They're running because they're AFRAID.
[1:17:24] <acedeone> love the map UI in this game
[1:17:27] <NewAndTastySixthHouse> @ZockerKauz Too bad, have more sword FEs FeelsBadMan
[1:17:29] <MyNameIsRasus> It's showing you all the secrets
[1:17:30] <Chris_ProPharah_Kun> hello woolie
[1:17:30] <DeathByPoke7> they are not dead until they are styled on -Marlin Pie
[1:17:31] <SubjectX07x> @WoolieVersus You can force drop glory kills on the same level as an enemy by jumping and performing it at the top of your jump.
[1:17:31] <ghostspartan80> get the keycard
[1:17:35] <Andrei11Droasca> My favorite still hasn't happened

[1:18:10] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus make sure you get those drones
[1:18:19] <%Exiliator> One thing I'm not a fan of in this game is the constant tempo drop
[1:18:22] <ghostspartan80> take the elevator downstairs
[1:18:27] <%DesertPenguin> this is video games

[1:19:41] <jorniev> i just hope doom eternal is not like wolfenstein youngblood
[1:19:43] <Andrei11Droasca> This game has that RE 4 feel were its a god dam video game and it doesn't give a fuck LUL

[1:21:12] <%omenzazu> you can
[1:21:13] <@Solidus_113> you have to backtrack because the place is still on lockdown
[1:21:13] <+Javaa01> DONT PICK UP THIS DRONE YET
[1:21:15] <+thesyndrome> you can absolutely level select after finishing a level
[1:21:19] <+Shikari21> DONT GET DRONE
[1:21:22] <Teyaric> This game has some serious scrapability - but its largely "early unlocks" and "bonuses". They're nice, but NOT neccesary
[1:21:24] <+Shikari21> SAVE IT
[1:21:25] <Tucker0603> not yet
[1:21:27] <+dirtyh4rr1> save it
[1:21:28] <MyNameIsRasus> SAVE IT
[1:21:28] <worldbrand> "are there.... emails? with lots of emojis perhaps?"
[1:21:30] <Teyaric> BACK OUT

[1:21:34] <SainEdge> save it
[1:21:34] <MeinKampfyC0uch> save it, there's another two weapons in this level
[1:21:34] <DatAsuna> You won't find everything, but you can can get all the upgrades easy enough with a bit of it
[1:21:37] <$Swish20XX> Levels often loop back around, kinda metriod soulsish
[1:21:41] <%omenzazu> save it
[1:21:47] <%Irridium> I mean there's enough drones to upgrade every weapon you'd be fine
[1:21:49] <DatAsuna> Three shot burst is solid
[1:21:55] <ralphfromdk> Most guns are fine with one upgrade most of the game
[1:21:55] <ghostspartan80> save it for micromissles
[1:21:57] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus you will soon find something to spend that drone on
[1:21:58] <Andrei11Droasca> Oh god ,he will miss all the preator chips wont he ? LUL
[1:21:59] <%omenzazu> go to zomb
[1:22:00] <Kahpoe_Lelou> I mean explosive shot is still solid
[1:22:01] <Personified134> he's gonna get another weapon soon so might as well save it
[1:22:03] <conflict1914> why are people saving it?

[1:22:31] <fist_wizard_jay> There is a big shiny gun around this level that that upgrade is more suited for
[1:22:31] <Arnoldoaad1> cat blue people
[1:22:32] <gunsrlove> @WoolieVersus Some secrets include getting powerful weapons early, might want to watch out for those
[1:22:34] <ghostspartan80> go back to the hatch

[1:23:45] <TheTakkster> is this either of their first time through doom?
[1:23:46] <am_omega> @cacophanes No that is another Warhammer 40k movie.

[1:25:36] <@Solidus_113> it's at the top
[1:25:37] <Personified134> BLIND
[1:25:38] <+thesyndrome> oh dear, this was a mistake; we relied on woolie to backtrack to something
[1:25:39] <s1rcuit> @WoolieVersus one of the secrets in this level is an early gun
[1:25:41] <+Mkingston> What version is Woolie playing?
[1:25:46] <@Solidus_113> Orange is used
[1:25:48] <SubjectX07x> Nonononono not used
[1:25:48] <+Shikari21> White means not used
[1:25:50] <SubjectX07x> White is not used
[1:25:51] <MyNameIsRasus> BLIND BOIS
[1:25:51] <+Mkingston> Never mind
[1:25:53] <+Shikari21> Woolie please
[1:25:54] <+paladinstarbuster> white is unused
[1:25:54] <+Kqha4000> Orange is used
[1:25:54] <+Grayhammatter> white is not used
[1:25:57] <+Mkingston> Obviously PS4
[1:25:58] <+Shikari21> ORANGE IS USED
[1:25:58] <MayorRev> oh no I just got here how long has he been wandering around
[1:26:01] <%Irridium> remember. remember how you got there beforehand. you can do it
[1:26:04] <hntronium> White means used goods
[1:26:08] <Tucker0603> @woolieversus white hasn't been grabbed
[1:26:11] <ghostspartan80> this game doesn't need this much backtracking l
[1:26:12] <SubjectX07x> White is not used goods
[1:26:15] <Personified134> white literally means the opposite of used goods
[1:26:18] <Andrei11Droasca> NotLikeThis
[1:26:21] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus click the left stick on the map screen to switch map views iirc. might make it easier to see
[1:26:27] <hntronium> White people are used
[1:26:28] <+YabbaTroll> oh yeah everyone gets stuck here
[1:26:34] <RyuuAoi> Tell me Doom Guy double guns it like Tomb Raider in this bitch!
[1:26:34] <hntronium> used goods
[1:26:40] <ShoggothLord> These maps are turning Woolie into Paige
[1:26:44] <+YabbaTroll> dude pat was here for like an hour
[1:26:53] <SubjectX07x> Doom guy does not double gun.
[1:26:55] <+YabbaTroll> when he streamed this like a year ago
[1:26:56] <%gatorafan> Paige would probably die playing this.
[1:26:56] <+Javaa01> There's a button you need to press in that room
[1:26:56] <RunningNGunning> Retrace those steps
[1:26:58] <ISkyHunterI> doom guy doesn't need 2 guns, one is enough
[1:26:59] <%K2YP70C0CK> doodTess doodTess
[1:27:00] <+Shikari21> Keep going
[1:27:00] <+Javaa01> That you just unlocked
[1:27:01] <RyuuAoi> Peach is Woolie's Stand.
[1:27:03] <$Essixian> @WoolieVersus There's a button in that room that opens the hatch in the floor!
[1:27:04] <+Mkingston> Always follow the green lights.
[1:27:04] <%Irridium> might wanna go back into the room
[1:27:06] <Lavrohas> head up the elevator
[1:27:07] <%Irridium> and check the computers
[1:27:09] <Lavrohas> thats where you went
[1:27:10] <SilverInferno3> Access that computer tho!
[1:27:11] <+Shikari21> The elevator
[1:27:15] <Lavrohas> in this room
[1:27:16] <@Solidus_113> so much for wall hugging

[1:27:50] <%HollowedIdjit> @woolieversus exploring can sometimes let you find weapons early

[1:27:53] <%Irridium> oh boy later levels are gonna be something LUL
[1:27:54] <legendaryemerald> Even I get confused where to go in this game, so Woolie playing this game is probably a great idea that will never result in wasted time.

[1:28:59] <legendaryemerald> tacticle scope is the best choice by far, are y'all kidding? sniper scope that'll lock down almost anything compared to some missiles that aren't much different from the shotgun grenade.

[1:34:00] <SubjectX07x> Djent is hot
[1:34:04] <+Corporate_Redeemer> The soundtrack actually has pentagrams and demonic imagery when played through a spectrograph

[1:34:36] <%JetpackMcQuack> "The name "Djent" is an onomatopoeia of this sound." LUL
[1:34:44] <%DesertPenguin> makes sense
[1:34:52] <+Shikari21> The sound track is like a good mix of djent and industrial metal
[1:34:54] <RyuuAoi> @madmatt2099 Normal
[1:34:55] <%DesertPenguin> onomatomato
[1:34:55] <Lavrohas> pentagrams and shit embedded in the goddamn spectrum of the music is the most metal shit
[1:34:59] <+spiraljoel> all genres and techniques in music get reinvented with a new name about every 10 years

[1:35:29] <+Corporate_Redeemer> @silverinferno3 Yes

[1:36:02] <SheefEatsBeef> hmmmm how to get up
[1:36:03] <ShutterSnap> I love Sam. I think he's used pretty well, these sort of clever breaks and Doom Guy has our reaction as the player: I NEED TO KILL, no BREAKS
[1:36:04] <CoffeeSlice> oh man
[1:36:05] <%Irridium> might wanna go back outside and look around

[1:40:27] <+Mkingston> Woolie can't look up. Just like dogs.
[1:40:35] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus Generally, if you see green lights, they are leading you to something or showing you a ledge that is climbable. Its a subtle enviromental design choice. watch for it
[1:40:48] <ghostspartan80> if this is progress lets just say Minh has a lot to edit out

[1:42:01] <axelkaspar> Tack för LuvSign @aeoneth
[1:42:03] <s1rcuit> @WoolieVersus you can perform different glory kills by aiming at different body parts
[1:42:03] <ghostspartan80> pretty sure everything is reachable
[1:42:07] <$Swish20XX> I just played through this and got everything
[1:42:10] <+mechslayer71> Okay, he may not be SUPER tucked
[1:42:12] <DeathByPoke7> You are the jump scare
[1:42:14] <+Neoepochx> I literally just played it this weekend doing a clean playthrough. Didn't need to go back for double jump.
[1:42:15] <+SirGO0SE> ROUND HOUSEO
[1:42:16] <+Neoepochx> It helps
[1:42:18] <+nekodelic> @s1rcuit he knows
[1:42:18] <+Neoepochx> But not necessary.
[1:42:24] <aero160h> micro missiles cost a lot of ammo don't spam them
[1:42:27] <%DesertPenguin> Great tactic for those guys is to do the explosive shot behind them
[1:42:31] <@Solidus_113> first token

[1:42:50] <ghostspartan80> Baron of Hell

[1:43:22] <%oyyzzo> got2goslow
[1:43:25] <%DesertPenguin> Powerup effectiveness is GREAT for the grenade you get later

[1:43:28] <FuqBoiSlim> hey woolie just in case the chat didnt tell you. you've already been fighting Imps 4Head
[1:43:29] <SilverInferno3> Yep lol

[1:43:33] <+paladinstarbuster> yep
[1:43:35] <MyNameIsRasus> Please
[1:43:35] <+ianabstract> correct
[1:43:35] <+spiraljoel> @axelkaspar Nah man he's a radical anarchist, Eternal is gonna feature him butchering angels too
[1:43:36] <+Grayhammatter> do it
[1:43:36] <%Solidnick18> yeah
[1:43:37] <+Javaa01> Go for it if you want the secrets
[1:43:38] <Tucker0603> yeh
[1:43:38] <+dirtyh4rr1> Navigation is good for ocd
[1:43:47] <%Solidnick18> get those
[1:43:48] <%DesertPenguin> click each one to see what they give you
[1:43:54] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus Generally, if you see green lights, they are leading you to something or showing you a ledge that is climbable. Its a subtle enviromental design choice. watch for it
[1:43:56] <%Louie_Salmon> I think I maxed navigation first, I wanted to find all the secrets
[1:43:57] <%mitchteck> Correct
[1:44:01] <+Neoepochx> Just remember to keep an eye on the compass if you need help.
[1:44:04] <zamzoph> @WoolieVersus read it all to us!
[1:44:05] <%Exiliator> read lore!
[1:44:07] <ghostspartan80> or you could just get to automap but with woolie... probably for the best
[1:44:09] <+SirGO0SE> lmao the heart on that demon
[1:44:10] <Andrei11Droasca> You can check out the lore on the monster's in the codecs
[1:44:10] <%allups> read it
[1:44:14] <+Javaa01> Secret Sense is kinda worthless, but the upgrade after it is vital
[1:44:38] <+Grayhammatter> bodied
[1:44:41] <%DesertPenguin> GRENADE SHOT
[1:44:41] <%Solidnick18> oh
[1:44:42] <hntronium> REKT
[1:44:43] <FuqBoiSlim> yiik...
[1:44:43] <SheefEatsBeef> security don't fuck around
[1:44:43] <+SirGO0SE> after the health beep boop i expect the beat to drop
[1:44:46] <SainEdge> Shield guys are the worst NotLikeThis
[1:44:46] <zamzoph> Woolie wants to punch so bad
[1:44:47] <SilverInferno3> Shield guys will RINSE you if you're not careful
[1:44:47] <Tucker0603> SHIELDS KICK YOUR ASS
[1:44:47] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus Generally, if you see green lights, they are leading you to something or showing you a ledge that is climbable. Its a subtle enviromental design choice. watch for it
[1:44:48] <%DesertPenguin> GREANDE AT THE FEET
[1:44:50] <MeinKampfyC0uch> can't rely on the chainsaw, ot
[1:44:51] <ouijabirdz> @WoolieVersus, when do the orgies at the House of Universal Truth start?
[1:44:52] <+sherndon226> MORTIS
[1:44:53] <+RudeRabbit> Yeah, you gotta watch out for those security guys. They're a pain.
[1:44:53] <%Louie_Salmon> Does Doom have any FOV options?
[1:44:58] <ghostspartan80> shield guys are the worst
[1:45:01] <+RudeRabbit> Particularly in a corridor.
[1:45:01] <Saltmeisterr> DOOOM
[1:45:02] <SilverInferno3> Dafeet!
[1:45:02] <+SirGO0SE> do feet
[1:45:03] <MeinKampfyC0uch> it's gonna be hella limited later on when you're spending 3-5 on demons per kill
[1:45:04] <KaseKaizer> dude with shield is my nemesis in almost every game he exists
[1:45:07] <+MadMatt2099> mfw shield guys seen in Doom eternal footage :(
[1:45:08] <Guyshane> Shields are a pain before you get the bigger guns
[1:45:12] <%DesertPenguin> Nice, he saw my advice
[1:45:13] <+Mkingston> Shield guys are annoying
[1:45:14] <axelkaspar> RIP AND TEAR
[1:45:14] <+Corporate_Redeemer> @louie_salmon Yes

[1:45:31] <spiderously> doomguy pisses inside the suit
[1:45:34] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @axelkaspar
[1:45:37] <aero160h> stop trying to do fighting game bs in an fps
[1:45:37] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus Generally, if you see green lights, they are leading you to something or showing you a ledge that is climbable. Its a subtle enviromental design choice. watch for it
[1:45:40] <Pt_Kamen> Sing Reggie, you know you want to!
[1:45:42] <%DesertPenguin> The BFG in this game is so cool
[1:45:42] <worldbrand> Im just glad to see you havin fun
[1:45:44] <Andrei11Droasca> Good ,cause me too LUL
[1:45:45] <mikesapartment> I forgot woolie was bad with maps
[1:45:49] <axelkaspar> Okay Reggie which demon do you want to fuck so far
[1:45:50] <+RudeRabbit> Advice: Rip and then Tear
[1:45:51] <+SirGO0SE> zoom in on reggie before you pee
[1:45:52] <+sherndon226> Respect those enemies they are for real
[1:45:52] <Ashenik1> Woolie MORE EXPLORING
[1:45:53] <%ultrasparkseid> RIP and tear into LIGHT PUNCH
[1:45:54] <%oyyzzo> rip&tear
[1:45:54] <ouijabirdz> Reggie! You coming to the orgy at the House of Universal Truth?
[1:45:57] <Ether101_Prime> Don't worry about upgrading weapons too much.
[1:46:01] <Madbearv> Woolie just toss more demons into the grinder that is Doomguy
[1:46:06] <Tucker0603> I'd fuck a Baroness if hell
[1:46:06] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1224743712657412096?s=19
[1:46:06] <%Prevot> Is saturday more Doom or is it ANOTHER new LP?
[1:46:07] <+kaustik1> protip: make guitar noises with your mouth to shoot demonds better
[1:46:07] <@Solidus_113> Hall Wug more, you move your camera around really fast and miss many doors and collectibles
[1:46:08] <+Javaa01> Here's my biggest advice, never don't stare at the map
[1:46:09] <%DesertPenguin> You need to learn "how" to play the game
[1:46:09] <SilverInferno3> Don't stop moving! Case the area, note health and ammo pickups, and keep dodging!
[1:46:11] <+Javaa01> The map is life
[1:46:15] <@Squdnate> You are doing much better than anticipated, speaking from previous demonstrations of your FPS skills
[1:46:17] <%Exiliator> woolieDATTEBAYO_SG "I see."
[1:46:17] <floralkami> wow, that was a day pee
[1:46:18] <%jepupu> Exploring is good in it, but if you don't mind returning to maps later on, that's fine too.
[1:46:25] <+flarebears> @WoolieVersus I;m making a game to practice coding, i need help with a setting for a text based DnD like game.
[1:46:26] <42nfl19> @WoolieVersus It's like new shoes, you have to stretch them out
[1:46:26] <+SirGO0SE> zoom in on reggie before pee
[1:46:27] <floralkami> a fast pee
[1:46:28] <KnivesEve> wait did i miss?
[1:46:28] <am_omega> Pro Tip: Keep moving.
[1:46:34] <%HollowedIdjit> @woolieversus some weapons can be found early via exploration, but you can't miss any iirc
[1:46:34] <Andrei11Droasca> @woolieversus Zigzags help to not get hit
[1:46:35] <ghostspartan80> don't get too caught up with backtracking
[1:46:36] <%oyyzzo> reggie
[1:46:37] <%DesertPenguin> Reggie, it never stops
[1:46:40] <+RudeRabbit> Reggie, remind Woolie to "look up"
[1:46:42] <+Mkingston> Reggie, are you being held against your will? Blink 3 times for yes.
[1:46:42] <%oyyzzo> sup
[1:46:44] <+SirGO0SE> need ASH
[1:46:46] <Arnoldoaad1> Protip: shot stuff then rip and tear
[1:46:48] <MyNameIsRasus> My advice is, pay some more attention to the compass on top of the screen when exploring
[1:46:48] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus Generally, if you see green lights, they are leading you to something or showing you a ledge that is climbable. Its a subtle enviromental design choice. watch for it
[1:46:49] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[1:46:56] <joshua_42> Never stop moving at all
[1:46:57] <+0rangeBoyZ> don't feel super pressured to collect every single thing if you feel like it (or to find those classic stages) but if you pass up upgrade chips I very much recommend going to get them back
[1:47:02] <+sherndon226> Reggie your hair is looking great
[1:47:04] <SilverInferno3> Keep an eye out for levers, they unlock the secret areas and give upgrade points
[1:47:05] <Skeletonmanners> Rip and Tips
[1:47:08] <BallerSwagBro9k> REGGIE LIKE TIPS?
[1:47:10] <%ozzrabbit> Learn to Circle-strafe Woolie. It’s a basic maneuver that you’re going to have to master.
[1:47:12] <suikudo> Reggie did you eat woolie?
[1:47:12] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus when you learn about runes, you really want air control and glory kill range upgrades
[1:47:16] <+Javaa01> You can find every regular weapon a level early from the intended progression
[1:47:16] <ouijabirdz> Just the tips <3
[1:47:17] <KaseKaizer> stripLuv
[1:47:17] <%Solidnick18> <3
[1:47:18] <+GarbageNirvana> <3
[1:47:18] <%DesertPenguin> awwwwwwwww
[1:47:18] <CaptRose> hey reggie good to see you bud!
[1:47:18] <+RudeRabbit> THAT WAS THREE BLINKS
[1:47:19] <+SirGO0SE> we love you Reg
[1:47:19] <BimboBagging> moon2CUTE
[1:47:19] <Tucker0603> which demon would ya bang?
[1:47:20] <BallerSwagBro9k> AWW
[1:47:20] <Shishi1205> <3
[1:47:21] <zamzoph> @WoolieVersus It's okay to be honest Reggie
[1:47:21] <mankeymania> 1. rip and tearing is fun. 2. ignore people's screaming for secrets they're optional.
[1:47:22] <DeathByPoke7> that was 3
[1:47:24] <Tennochief> Awws
[1:47:26] <BallerSwagBro9k> <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
[1:47:26] <%Solidnick18> Thank you reggie
[1:47:27] <+Neoepochx> Circle Strafe is the Oldest of Tech
[1:47:30] <%jiggy_snipe> Reggie :)
[1:47:33] <SomersaultJustice> we wuv u reggie
[1:47:34] <DatAsuna> Most of the optional stuff is not really needed
[1:47:34] <MyNameIsRasus> Love you Reggie
[1:47:35] <+Andu_in> Reggie, magnificient stache and beard.
[1:47:36] <zamzoph> @WoolieVersus make Woolie read lore to us
[1:47:39] <$Swish20XX> A lot of levels loop around kinda like a metriod/souls game
[1:47:39] <SilverInferno3> Turn up sensitivity if it seems he's not aiming fast enough
[1:47:42] <+crimsonharvest> yea the color language of the game is pretty distinct
[1:47:45] <acedeone> upgrade early weapons first because ammo for stronger weapons is scarce
[1:47:45] <+Mkingston> Green lights = progress
[1:47:46] <Shishi1205> grren lights and blood
[1:47:46] <floralkami> Strong beard, Reggie!
[1:47:54] <%Irridium> yeah make sure to read lore because that shit's sick
[1:47:55] <+SirGO0SE> actually combed your hair now that they arent zooming in on you LUL
[1:47:59] <%jepupu> Watch the death animation at least once if you die in lava eventually
[1:48:03] <%Solidnick18> he ate woolies feet
[1:48:04] <fist_wizard_jay> Yo what did I miss? Woolie go to pee?
[1:48:04] <aero160h> r u gonna play the game at some point Reggie
[1:48:04] <DeathByPoke7> the same thing works for me except i have poofy asian hair
[1:48:05] <%K2YP70C0CK> hyped for MvC2 at EVO?
[1:48:06] <+flarebears> @WoolieVersus I;m making a game to practice coding, i need help with a setting for a text based DnD like game.
[1:48:07] <DatAsuna> piss on the demons
[1:48:09] <gunsrlove> 1000 ml of piss
[1:48:14] <%omenzazu> love you guys
[1:48:14] <+HerdenDerden> pistol OP
[1:48:15] <Andrei11Droasca> Also do the challenges for the runes ,they give you buffs
[1:48:19] <%GraceTBM> plug in a keyboard
[1:48:19] <+RudeRabbit> If you and Woolie were to fuse, would you be Rellie or Wooggie?
[1:48:20] <MyNameIsRasus> Make Woolie die in lava
[1:48:21] <+Javaa01> Yeah the pistol isn't a weapon
[1:48:21] <Madbearv> Ready for MvC2
[1:48:23] <+SirGO0SE> growing in well
[1:48:25] <Madbearv> Evo
[1:48:26] <@Squdnate> Pro Tips: Shoot first, Explore after (dont backtrack too much, it isn't required). Move all the time, and Glory Kill every opportunity available
[1:48:28] <+Javaa01> The pistol is actual garbage
[1:48:29] <Tucker0603> shotgun is a workhorse
[1:48:29] <ouijabirdz> Reggie! Warturtle sucks ass, coming at you with straight facts
[1:48:29] <Ahk_90> the pistol is pointless
[1:48:30] <hntronium> Other weapons are gud
[1:48:32] <Shishi1205> if it has infinite anmo...
[1:48:33] <%omenzazu> pistol mad butt
[1:48:33] <%Calern> i dont remember using the pistol ever unless it was for challenges
[1:48:33] <Ahk_90> too weak
[1:48:34] <Tennochief> awesome
[1:48:34] <zamzoph> is Reggie reading a discord channel or something?
[1:48:36] <Ether101_Prime> You can get every weapon upgrade in the game. Making them out gets you something special if I remember right.
[1:48:38] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus Upgrades are tied to challenges/ding certain kinds of kills
[1:48:39] <%omenzazu> its uncle reggie
[1:48:40] <worldbrand> baban ba ban ban ban
[1:48:41] <ShoggothLord> Shotgun is good. Upgrade that, not the pistol.
[1:48:46] <SilverInferno3> @zamzoph He's reading this chat lol
[1:48:47] <zheldor651> Marry me Reggie, you look amazing
[1:48:48] <%omenzazu> he got that wise black man vibes
[1:48:49] <worldbrand> yo reggie killed it in dialect
[1:48:52] <+Neoepochx> You can go back to levels and grab collectables without messing up any progress stuff so you can do secret hunting on the off time.
[1:48:52] <MyNameIsRasus> TRUCKIN
[1:48:53] <am_omega> @WoolieVersus The lore is amazing and a good read, Get Runes they are great.
[1:48:54] <%K2YP70C0CK> im buying it
[1:49:00] <emeraldskrull> I wish minh was around to get dunked on again
[1:49:02] <+Mkingston> Raise bilingual children: the game.
[1:49:09] <Ashenik1> You cute Reggie :>
[1:49:11] <DeathByPoke7> oh shit
[1:49:11] <@SoushinSen> No
[1:49:12] <Shishi1205> OOOO
[1:49:13] <$Swish20XX> I agree
[1:49:14] <SomersaultJustice> wartortle is great
[1:49:14] <%Exiliator> Nice beard Reggie! Is the next step to get dreads? then piercings? and then finally you can challenge the guy next to you for the title of "Woolie" and take over the channel?
[1:49:15] <%JetpackMcQuack> D:
[1:49:17] <hntronium> wartortle cool
[1:49:18] <zazzera01> LUL
[1:49:18] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[1:49:19] <%HollowedIdjit> @woolieversus the fully upgraded Micromissiles are lowkey busted ngl
[1:49:19] <+McSoliace> agreed
[1:49:20] <SomersaultJustice> blastoise is lame Kappa
[1:49:24] <acedeone> Wartortle is boss
[1:49:24] <BallerSwagBro9k> WARTURLE IS THE SHIT
[1:49:25] <%Prevot> WARTORTLE DA BEST
[1:49:25] <fist_wizard_jay> OI
[1:49:26] <%ultrasparkseid> Wartortle is Trash
[1:49:28] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus A fully maxed pistol is a FANTASTIC weapon, ignore the people that say its trash, I played through the game on the hardest diffulculty. Its a good gun once its upgraded, but ignore it untill then (which probably wont happen this LP, I dont think yall will be finding all the upgrade points unless yall want to in a cleanup session)
[1:49:29] <+SirGO0SE> tail made of marshmellow fluff lookin mother fucker
[1:49:30] <%JetpackMcQuack> We were all teenagers at one point
[1:49:32] <KaseKaizer> mid evolution starters LUL
[1:49:32] <fist_wizard_jay> BLASTOISE IS GREAT
[1:49:34] <%omenzazu> warturtle is a G
[1:49:35] <fist_wizard_jay> FUCK YALL
[1:49:38] <NeonBleu> wartortle is horrible
[1:49:39] <CursedNobleman> wartortle is the best 2nd ev
[1:49:40] <%Kriss1827> Wartortle is pretty trash regie admit it
[1:49:41] <zamzoph> If Blastoise was my dad, things would be different around here
[1:49:46] <%omenzazu> hot the Hermes wave ears lol
[1:49:48] <+Mkingston> Ask Woolie and Pat about Wartortle
[1:49:51] <CureMode666> Have a nice day Reggie
[1:49:53] <SilverInferno3> Probably seems obvious but remember headshots do more damage, esp on the big guys
[1:49:53] <Andrei11Droasca> Why is it purple, all the other ones are blue
[1:49:54] <+SirGO0SE> FRO MASTER
[1:49:57] <%JetpackMcQuack> Charmeleon is just a tall charmander
[1:49:57] <fist_wizard_jay> Blastoise is the absolute greatest
[1:49:58] <%Calern> tortank or blastoise tho
[1:49:58] <%ultrasparkseid> roll?
[1:50:02] <DatAsuna> rock the fro
[1:50:02] <%gatorafan> woolieREGGIEFUL
[1:50:03] <%Exiliator> I agree to that
[1:50:03] <+Order_of_Mystery> Wartortle > charmelion
[1:50:06] <Ahk_90> You look GREAT with beard and Afro
[1:50:09] <JayEarly> F-Tier: Pistol. S-Tier: All other weapons. SS-Tier: Super Shotgun
[1:50:09] <SomersaultJustice> go bald
[1:50:11] <%K2YP70C0CK> bed hair & beard OP
[1:50:12] <+Neoepochx> Yeah, so there isn't any pressure on that.
[1:50:14] <+0rangeBoyZ> recommended listening for afterward! the nondynamic track version of BFG division is a bop and very much worth your attention.
[1:50:15] <$R3Roundabout> ULTIMATE BAIT
[1:50:17] <+SirGO0SE> literally
[1:50:22] <MyNameIsRasus> Correct
[1:50:30] <+kraajkase> The pistol is so trash they took it out of Doom Eternal
[1:50:31] <ghostspartan80> the pistol pretty much exists for challenge runs

[1:51:27] <DXLelouch24> MAHVEL 2
[1:51:27] <+Neoepochx> @DatAsuna I agree. The only reason you'd want to "minmax" weapon skills is to take the time to unlock the final skill on them faster.
[1:51:27] <%ozzrabbit> Woolie has acquired a taste for FPS games. He must be pushed to give Destiny 2 a try, even if he only sampled the free content.

[1:53:17] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus Generally, if you see green lights, they are leading you to something or showing you a ledge that is climbable. Its a subtle enviromental design choice. watch for it

[1:53:33] <+Javaa01> Every character as well
[1:53:45] <fist_wizard_jay> Woolie Vs Help, BRAND THAT SHIT
[1:53:46] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus honestly you of all people would really appreciate this lore. give you some FANTASTIC kirby lore inspiration
[1:53:48] <%Solidnick18> lore is rad
[1:53:51] <+Javaa01> Read that on your own time, cause there's GOOD SHIT in there
[1:53:52] <fist_wizard_jay> Hell*
[1:53:52] <thetrashman_sc> the lore is sick tho
[1:53:52] <Djinnazz> the lore is SO METAL
[1:53:52] <zamzoph> but the lore is good tho
[1:53:56] <%DesertPenguin> IT'S WELL THOUGHT OUT
[1:53:57] <+Markmeltzer> Doomguy cant read
[1:53:59] <+crimsonharvest> he doesnt hate the lore he hates computers
[1:53:59] <MeinKampfyC0uch> but the lore is GOOD THO
[1:53:59] <Lavrohas> they designed the game to have both. they knew peopel wouldnt care about lore tho
[1:54:01] <+Javaa01> Except for the Doom Marine lore
[1:54:01] <RunningNGunning> Lore is VERY optional
[1:54:02] <+Corporate_Redeemer> DOOMGUY IS THE LORE
[1:54:03] <suikudo> These demons gotta go
[1:54:03] <Arnoldoaad1> Lore is pretty good here
[1:54:03] <%GeneralSCPatton> BEST LORE
[1:54:03] <DatAsuna> Nah he just hates Hayden and demons
[1:54:03] <ghostspartan80> lore in hell is especially rad
[1:54:04] <%wujak> wujak subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months, currently on a 14 month streak! doom eternal is like this but with air dashes and grapple hooks
[1:54:07] <+Order_of_Mystery> The lore ramps up once you get to a certain special place.
[1:54:09] <+Mkingston> I Am The Lore
[1:54:10] <Ether101_Prime> The lore implies that the Doom Slayer is the original Doom Guy.
[1:54:10] <%HollowedIdjit> @woolieversus the most important tip I can give is to jump into a pool of lava, just to see the death animation. it's badass
[1:54:10] <conflict1914> the lore is good and there but you don't *have* to read it to have a good time
[1:54:11] <Andrei11Droasca> LORE IS FUCKING METAL
[1:54:12] <+Javaa01> Read the Doom Marine lore LIVE
[1:54:12] <acedeone> Doomguy is tired of this hell
[1:54:13] <%GeneralSCPatton> HE'S BUSY
[1:54:13] <%DesertPenguin> Oh my god Pat just started streaming. Is he high?
[1:54:17] <+Neoepochx> Doom Guy IS the lore.
[1:54:19] <DatAsuna> Doom guy doesn't hate lore, he hates the assholes telling him not to rip and tear
[1:54:22] <+Corporate_Redeemer> Just wait till you get to the SLAYER TESTAMENTS
[1:54:24] <+Ondartyr> it's because he IS the lore. there's no need for him to read it.
[1:54:24] <+toolofparanoia> i want to meet the Wretch in Doom Eternal
[1:54:30] <Ashenik1> Woolie BE THE GOOSE
[1:54:32] <fist_wizard_jay> FAHCK OFF
[1:54:32] <+Shikari21> oh no pat steaming and his new name confused me
[1:54:32] <%valriot> Doomguy is an anti-narrative character in a game that does have a narrative
[1:54:39] <StonerStan101> Oh shit Woolie, Pat just went on.
[1:54:45] <+SirGO0SE> 360 GLORY KILL
[1:54:47] <%DesertPenguin> Oh yea, definitely R3 for Melee, you don't need to crouch in this game
[1:54:52] <DatAsuna> You pick it up early
[1:54:54] <+GarbageNirvana> It just swaps two buttons to let your right thumb do more
[1:54:55] <acedeone> you'll get the flow
[1:54:56] <%Exiliator> What happened to the Woolie fps controller + keyboard setup anyway`?
[1:54:58] <DatAsuna> It comes pretty naturally
[1:55:01] <ghostspartan80> Doom guy already knows all the lore
[1:55:10] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus honestly you of all people would really appreciate this lore. give you some FANTASTIC kirby lore inspiration

[1:55:32] <+nekodelic> @exiliator that shit is great
[1:55:33] <SilverInferno3> I wish console games let you freely rebind
[1:55:33] <DatAsuna> Sadly the game only has presets, not customs

[2:00:42] <%omenzazu> x bfg wrf is that lol
[2:00:47] <%Irridium> @WoolieVersus Might be a good idea to try it all out when going back through levels
[2:00:54] <DatAsuna> Mirror's edge used it for a reason
[2:00:54] <ghostspartan80> is this the mlg layout or something

[2:02:46] <%DesertPenguin> @ghostspartan80 You take that back!
[2:02:47] <DatAsuna> @Solidus_113 early days are the only time to learn
[2:02:47] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus better to do control swaps early before you learn too much and muscle memory is set in and irreplacable
[2:02:52] <%Exiliator> Back to the lab again woolieDATTEBAYO_SG
[2:02:57] <am_omega> Wait you got your learners permit before you drifted? LUL

[2:03:20] <SilverInferno3> @DatAsuna Just ammo
[2:03:23] <HellomynameisDood> if you were looking for best controls you'd be using keyboard and mouse, so stick with the default button layout
[2:03:32] <@Solidus_113> LUL
[2:03:32] <Speccu_> doesn't razer make some 3rd party ps4 pad with more custom buttons or something
[2:03:34] <+Mkingston> Glory kill or health. Chainsaw for ammo.
[2:03:36] <+RudeRabbit> bruh
[2:03:37] <fairore> woolie make sure to pick up the gun
[2:03:39] <Speccu_> shield guys have shotguns
[2:03:39] <acedeone> F
[2:03:42] <+mattiabh> shield guy a dick
[2:03:42] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus better to do control swaps early before you learn too much and muscle memory is set in and irreplacable
[2:03:44] <+Javaa01> Don't shoot the SHIELD
[2:03:45] <%DesertPenguin> Explosive at the feet
[2:03:46] <DatAsuna> @SilverInferno3 Nah it was plasma rifle
[2:03:48] <kvassimoto> Use your shield Woolie

[2:04:05] <%DesertPenguin> womp womp
[2:04:06] <%valriot> shield guys are annoying in this, plasma rifle is best, in eternal is basically just kills them if you break the shield
[2:04:12] <rsg220> shields are actually strong if you don't have chainsaw or stun bomb
[2:04:17] <+Mkingston> Rhythm game
[2:04:25] <Ashenik1> yeye Kappa
[2:04:33] <ghostspartan80> plasma rifle with heatshield is so good
[2:04:34] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus There's a new gun on that desk
[2:04:43] <DonsCountryStore> Woolie, for your own and audience enjoyment, consider turning off the ugly "glory kill highlight" in options, you can still DO the glory kills by visually seeing when a demon is staggered
[2:04:45] <@Solidus_113> he has the rifle
[2:04:46] <Lavrohas> @DatAsuna the gun hes currently using
[2:04:46] <+Grayhammatter> he has that gun
[2:04:47] <hottdogman> yeah def go at a speed that's comfortable but like every time you take damage is when youre standing still, so if you can learn just dont stop
[2:04:50] <NickHatesSnow> Grenades a great for sheilds

[2:17:47] <laserbeaming> I don't remember the next gun
[2:17:49] <acedeone> Marker?
[2:17:51] <%DesertPenguin> From here on out let's not tell him what to do
[2:17:53] <ghostspartan80> rocket launcher I think
[2:17:58] <hntronium> are there no map markers?
[2:18:01] <%ozzrabbit> Is it me, or did that music sound like Planet Heck from Earth Worm Jim?
[2:18:02] <%DesertPenguin> It only mattered for the first one so he wasn't screwed
[2:18:04] <Speccu_> this level is like a central hub with branches so its easy to backtrack
[2:18:10] <+GeneralHysterics> I thought plasma rifle was first
[2:18:10] <%K2YP70C0CK> atpSolid atpSolid
[2:18:12] <SilverInferno3> I usually don't like backseating either but he does wants tips and having a mod per weapon is pretty important
[2:18:15] <%DesertPenguin> shhhhhhh
[2:18:15] <sonofthedeepsouth> YOU NEED A CORPSE
[2:18:22] <Halospaz117> Wow that was an in character response
[2:18:22] <%DesertPenguin> ok
[2:18:24] <+GeneralHysterics> What a doom slayer thing to do. "access denied? BLAM"
[2:18:28] <ghostspartan80> lol he forgot the corpse
[2:18:32] <+dosan121> can't believe this game is 4 years old, doesn't look like it
[2:18:38] <DedlokPM> @hntronium it is marked on the map already anyway
[2:18:46] <@Solidus_113> yellow paint
[2:18:49] <Vyneci> Or yellow
[2:18:56] <Spirit_NB> the Warframe paint
[2:18:57] <%Exiliator> Red paint?
[2:18:57] <Djinnazz> naw
[2:18:57] <rsg220> lol now
[2:18:58] <stanlychicken> nah
[2:19:00] <rsg220> lol no
[2:19:02] <slim_shady2019> Jump into the lava
[2:19:02] <Maids4lyfe> no
[2:19:04] <Ashenik1> RIP Minh
[2:19:07] <Maids4lyfe> he already did that
[2:19:10] <+Javaa01> They don't
[2:19:14] <ghostspartan80> or the damn vines/ropes in far cry
[2:19:15] <DedlokPM> @slim_shady2019 they already did
[2:19:16] <hntronium> @DedlokPM So was the one on the previous map and the search still happened
[2:19:17] <ZeeJiggle> Green lights work nice considering a lot of the colors are like, reds.
[2:19:20] <%DesertPenguin> I never noticed the lights guiding you before
[2:19:22] <slim_shady2019> Dope
[2:19:24] <+crimsonharvest> hand get
[2:19:29] <+khazdee> i do
[2:19:29] <sonofthedeepsouth> RESPECT THE DEAD
[2:19:30] <+paladinstarbuster> I DO
[2:19:34] <+primax104> some people do it
[2:19:34] <Djinnazz> yeah they do
[2:19:35] <sonofthedeepsouth> I do
[2:19:36] <rsg220> BITCHES DON'T
[2:19:36] <hntronium> no one does that? you sure
[2:19:37] <%Irridium> people do do that for whatever reason
[2:19:37] <Arnoldoaad1> Max died on the first room on the highest difficulty
[2:19:38] <spiderously> max does that
[2:19:38] <%ultrasparkseid> yes they do
[2:19:39] <VJdarkworld> need a hand? :)
[2:19:41] <$ofloofy> woolie desecrating the dead!
[2:19:41] <%ironohki> Because I hate my sanity I'm watching Pat's and Woolie's stream at the same time.
[2:19:48] <morcego_cinzento_arts> that dude just landed DoomGuy a hand
[2:19:50] <+Javaa01> Naw, Nightmare is totally doable here first time
[2:19:50] <+paladinstarbuster> YES
[2:19:51] <+Mkingston> yes
[2:19:51] <%DesertPenguin> yes
[2:19:53] <Speccu_> you should see what level challenges are
[2:19:54] <+Javaa01> It's not that hard
[2:19:57] <worldbrand> I dunno woolie, i think people who would bother to do it on the hardest difficulty are the type to do it on their first run
[2:20:04] <joshua_42> That’s called “Boss Rage” mode
[2:20:07] <DedlokPM> yeah. that is a near death state, not a death state
[2:20:10] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[2:20:12] <+spiraljoel> Staggered enemies recover to half health if you don't pop em fast enough
[2:20:12] <ghostspartan80> Nightmare in this game is a real rush
[2:20:16] <stanlychicken> tasty
[2:20:21] <%DesertPenguin> Pro Tip: Keep your shotgun out at all times
[2:20:26] <zenith0111> @woolieversus I usually don't have enough time to finish the game multiple times so I just do it on the hardest setting so I get the most out of the experience
[2:20:47] <+spiraljoel> Nightmare is interesting, the enemies don't take more hits than they do on lower difficulty but they're way more aggressive and YOU'RE more fragile
[2:20:50] <@Solidus_113> gore nest
[2:20:51] <+spiraljoel> You die in about 3 hits
[2:20:52] <BallerSwagBro9k> @DesertPenguin Also remember to feed it, pet it , and love it
[2:20:56] <%Irridium> the GORE NEST
[2:20:59] <$Swish20XX> There is a hidden ledge in that room for a little secret but I think it's just armor
[2:21:01] <Tucker0603> gore nest
[2:21:04] <+Shikari21> Its a gore nest not hell portal
[2:21:06] <laserbeaming> Tasty
[2:21:07] <$ofloofy> PARTY PARTY PARTY
[2:21:10] <ghostspartan80> you're basically a glass cannon on nightmare
[2:21:14] <MayorRev> The gore nest scream always jarred me
[2:21:15] <+chiluzza> a dope hocket game happened here
[2:21:28] <%gatorafan> This guys come to play Melty
[2:21:28] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:21:37] <+GeneralHysterics> They're demons sent to fight a guy known for murder fucking demons. I wouldn't be happy either
[2:21:40] <dukenux> oh my god
[2:21:40] <JaywalkingKnight> I'd say you're pretty glassish on Ultra Violence already
[2:21:42] <+spiraljoel> Hell Razors
[2:21:47] <%DesertPenguin> Next time you come across one of these things, take a good look at it. It shows another world inside the portal. Really cool graphic detail
[2:21:48] <+spiraljoel> They got Hell Lasers!
[2:21:55] <+SirGO0SE> HOLD THAT
[2:21:58] <Tennochief> YO
[2:22:01] <%Irridium> the Hell Razer and its Hell Laser
[2:22:01] <Halospaz117> LOOK AT ME AS YOU DIE
[2:22:04] <dukenux> i didnt expect this to be the new LP. excellent
[2:22:18] <ghostspartan80> one fireball from an imp can instakill you on nightmare
[2:22:21] <Ahk_90> For now
[2:22:22] <+Order_of_Mystery> Hell Razor!
[2:22:39] <zenith0111> I'm glad Woolie has started to play more fast paced games.
[2:22:50] <HellomynameisDood> jump in the big lava
[2:23:01] <+Javaa01> We already did the lava
[2:23:01] <@Solidus_113> the area of the first gameplay reveal
[2:23:03] <rsg220> boy woolie plays fighting games, if those aint fast paced i dont know what is
[2:23:03] <NickHatesSnow> oh this level is big
[2:23:04] <Ahk_90> Feel free to use the map
[2:23:10] <+chiluzza> go sploring
[2:23:10] <$Swish20XX> Check that box on the bridge when you walk by it
[2:23:12] <DedlokPM> @HellomynameisDood he already saw the lava death animation
[2:23:12] <HellomynameisDood> Jump in the lava
[2:23:18] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus from the bottom floor with lava, go in door at back/south side and look up and mantle the pipes to access a secret corridor with a new weapon on the desk.
[2:23:18] <%Irridium> YO GET THAt
[2:23:26] <Ahk_90> it's surprisingly understandable
[2:23:29] <NickHatesSnow> he already jumped into the lava
[2:23:31] <Ashenik1> he already jumped into lava
[2:23:33] <HellomynameisDood> @dedlokpm thanks for the info
[2:23:34] <Speccu_> this level is a nice hub
[2:23:37] <+spiraljoel> Do me a favor, next time you Glory Kill a Possessed Soldier or Hell Razer, look at their left leg from the front when you hit the button
[2:23:53] <MeinKampfyC0uch> that's a great glory kill
[2:23:57] <MayorRev> doomguy says "fall damage is for cowards"
[2:24:14] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus from the bottom floor with lava, go in door at back/south side and look up and mantle the pipes to access a secret corridor with a new weapon on the desk.
[2:24:15] <%DesertPenguin> right
[2:24:17] <Lavrohas> its this room
[2:24:19] <%DesertPenguin> look right
[2:24:24] <rsg220> fucks sake let him play the game
[2:24:25] <+Mkingston> Has Woolie played through Doom 1&2?
[2:24:26] <%DesertPenguin> there was armor
[2:24:28] <+NotHereToStream> anti air fireball LUL
[2:24:34] <s1rcuit> floor is literal lava
[2:24:41] <SainEdge> SourPls
[2:24:43] <zenith0111> Music is too good
[2:24:47] <Speccu_> look at their legs to sweep the leg when glory kill
[2:24:55] <b_ikki> doom people giving souls people a run for their money
[2:24:57] <laserbeaming> SourPls
[2:25:06] <%DesertPenguin> look at it closely
[2:25:07] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus after you kill this gore nest, go through the door in this room that was access denied, right near the gore nest. then look up
[2:25:10] <laserbeaming> Good damn I love DOOM Music
[2:25:10] <ghostspartan80> Can't wait for bfg division and rip and tear
[2:25:15] <SainEdge> PogChamp

[2:25:26] <%K2YP70C0CK> doodBait
[2:25:26] <%Irridium> OH SHIT IT'S THAT THING
[2:25:27] <zamzoph> deepest lore
[2:25:29] <%DesertPenguin> Each one is different
[2:25:31] <%kyh9> You're going to see a lot more of that
[2:25:32] <+Shikari21> I never noticed thats fukin sweet
[2:25:35] <+spiraljoel> Yep, that's a lategame level in there
[2:25:37] <ghostspartan80> thats a future level
[2:25:39] <NaturalGear> it's the kiln of the first flame
[2:25:41] <$ofloofy> Hell-o-Vision
[2:25:42] <MeinKampfyC0uch> this game is just so well-crafted
[2:25:51] <%DesertPenguin> I didn't notice that until three playthroughs in
[2:26:03] <Explodincatz> see that hell over there? you can slay it
[2:26:16] <thriftshopmusketeer> DOOOM
[2:26:20] <%DesertPenguin> chainsaw
[2:26:26] <+CoronetChris> If there's one issue I have with this game is that the first person perspective makes me motion sick.
[2:26:27] <+Mkingston> legs
[2:26:29] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus after you kill this gore nest, go through the door in this room that was access denied, right near the gore nest. then look up. it will lead you to secret weapon.
[2:26:40] <+paladinstarbuster> skin there ass raw
[2:26:54] <+aishman> Have you guys found any of the retro levels yet?
[2:26:55] <gunsrlove> BIG LEVEL
[2:26:57] <Lavrohas> right behind you @WoolieVersus
[2:26:59] <@Solidus_113> they found 1
[2:27:01] <%DesertPenguin> Yea aishman
[2:27:10] <laserbeaming> Yeah this level is huge
[2:27:10] <+aishman> Oh good. Those are GREAT
[2:27:22] <$Swish20XX> Reggie might as well have a guide on hand at this point
[2:27:24] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus after you kill this gore nest, go through the door in this room that was access denied, right near the gore nest. then look up. it will lead you to secret weapon.
[2:27:25] <+aishman> Also yeah this level is like "Hey, this ain't no corridor game"
[2:27:43] <+aishman> Yeah reggie really should get a guide I think, there are so many secrets and stuff in this game
[2:27:50] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus NO THIS IS IT
[2:27:52] <+Javaa01> This is OPTIONAL
[2:27:54] <Maids4lyfe> murder = progress
[2:27:56] <Lavrohas> this is it!
[2:27:59] <@Solidus_113> it's a massive map, there's no straight "progress"
[2:27:59] <+crimsonharvest> really dont need a guide, just get the navigation upgrades
[2:28:01] <%Exiliator> THAT WAS IT
[2:28:02] <%jepupu> Map?
[2:28:07] <+aishman> MAP
[2:28:08] <Lavrohas> that was a secret @WoolieVersus
[2:28:11] <%Irridium> that door was it I think
[2:28:16] <Lavrohas> that was not progress
[2:28:25] <ghostspartan80> lol you don't need a guide this game is pretty straightforward
[2:28:40] <@Solidus_113> Progress is finding keys to locked doors
[2:28:41] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1224743712657412096?s=19
[2:28:55] <$Swish20XX> I'm pretty sure you can always go back. Just don't hit the screen at the end of the levels
[2:28:55] <%Exiliator> Now this is doom! woolieYE Standing still is for losers
[2:29:10] <NickHatesSnow> this level is all about exploring
[2:29:27] <laserbeaming> Rip and Tear until it's done
[2:29:35] <%ironohki> Rip and Terry!
[2:29:41] <Speccu_> see jessica in human resources
[2:29:43] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus it was in that little junction across the way
[2:29:46] <zenith0111> Woolie should get the classic Doom mod where it puts the gun in the center
[2:29:48] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus go back in
[2:29:53] <rsg220> wish the pistol wasn't so wimpy
[2:29:57] <@Solidus_113> it's not a mod @zenith0111
[2:29:59] <%jepupu> Look at map more
[2:29:59] <Ether101_Prime> I don't think I've ever seen the kick one.
[2:30:11] <%jepupu> Forward, right
[2:30:16] <%jepupu> No not back
[2:30:24] <ghostspartan80> look up
[2:30:28] <+OtterSlinger> I love centered weapons, but the weapons in this game don't look so good centered
[2:30:32] <Andrei11Droasca> Ok ,this is going to be complicated to explain
[2:30:38] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus there was more than one thing to jump up and climb
[2:30:38] <+crimsonharvest> i think you need to go up a bit first somehow
[2:30:40] <zenith0111> @solidus_113 Oh but maxamillion used a mod XD oh
[2:30:48] <@Solidus_113> No he didn't
[2:30:52] <@Solidus_113> He just went to the options
[2:30:59] <+ADial42> Hey all
[2:31:01] <@chesterr01> kinda lost?
[2:31:08] <rsg220> hey friend

[2:38:34] <Ether101_Prime> The original voice for Optimus Prime, Peter Cullen, also did the voice for the Predictor. He based the clicking sound effect on a dying horseshoe crab he found as a child.

[2:39:24] <Halospaz117> Honestly I thought that was what we were going for before I saw it was the rocket launcher
[2:39:31] <%DesertPenguin> Advanced Research Complex. That's this one right?

[2:40:06] <$Swish20XX> I thought plasma was at the end of the last level
[2:40:07] <Madbearv> I wish Doomguy was like
[2:40:11] <+Woronov> @WoolieVersus plz stop exploring that much if u have problems with directions. Just run to enemies. U havent shot in 15 min in a DOOM game ...
[2:40:19] <Madbearv> 25% faster
[2:40:20] <dukenux> I wish Doomguy was real
[2:40:23] <dukenux> or in Smash
[2:40:24] <MeinKampfyC0uch> plasma is a secret in the second level, pretty sure it's given to you in this one

[2:42:08] <Andrei11Droasca> Only Woolie would use a rocket point blank LUL
[2:42:14] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus death will only ever resest map and objective progression. NEVER upgrades or weapon unlocks after youve gotten them
[2:42:16] <+Neoepochx> How's it going slayer?
[2:42:35] <+Shikari21> I think it comes soon

[2:43:05] <ghostspartan80> use the grenade launcher behind the shield guy
[2:43:22] <%croxeye> also best way to play doom is def a mouse and keyboard, i don't know if your setup supports it rn tho :(

[2:43:49] <Lavrohas> !motivated
[2:43:51] <$Swish20XX> So what do the navigation upgrades do? Will they eventually show levers and other hidden secrets?
[2:43:56] <%Exiliator> Theyre like people pinatas :)
[2:43:58] <Halospaz117> YEAAAH
[2:44:00] <%jiggy_snipe> OMG that was sick

[2:44:32] <Saltmeisterr> Has woolie never played doom before?
[2:44:35] <SilverInferno3> Also the suit upgrades
[2:44:38] <Naughta_Noob> Curbstomping a mofo with his own leg is the best
[2:44:44] <ghostspartan80> clearly not lol
[2:44:45] <$Swish20XX> @SilverInferno3 Ah I never used, semms kinda useless

[2:45:58] <Saltmeisterr> nah
[2:46:02] <$Swish20XX> Does Woolie want us to tell him about secrets when he's by them? I don't wanna keep throwing out hints
[2:46:05] <%croxeye> if you go on one of the raised rails you can kinda pull yourself up
[2:46:07] <praisedasun_> ha "boss"
[2:46:10] <+chiluzza> low on health? GO STEAL THEIR HEALTH
[2:46:14] <Naughta_Noob> @localrobyn Nah, they're demons, perfectly Christian
[2:46:15] <+TaphexWin> You get that shield later in the level
[2:46:23] <%Broand> nah and rip
[2:46:29] <Lavrohas> @Swish20XX im only throwing shit out if its major like a weapon or something hes clearly looking for and/or struggling with
[2:46:30] <+Order_of_Mystery> @woolieversus bigger enemies need more chainsaw fuel charges to kill
[2:46:41] <ShoggothLord> Go back you missed a door
[2:46:49] <SilverInferno3> WOOF

[2:47:18] <%croxeye> use shotgun alt fire more
[2:47:22] <%Solidnick18> micro missles are good on the hell knights
[2:47:22] <JaywalkingKnight> Run away from knight, kill the soldier, turn on the knight
[2:47:30] <+TaphexWin> Never stop moving is probably the best advice to give
[2:47:35] <LocalRobyn> healing? in MY doom???
[2:47:39] <ghostspartan80> use rockets on knight
[2:47:40] <+dasmause> woolie y u no schut
[2:47:44] <%Louie_Salmon> It's more likely than you think
[2:47:47] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus keep in mind you are in an invincible state during glory kills. sometimes delaying one to use it a bit later as a dodge from a hell knight charge can be useful
[2:47:49] <%Solidnick18> LMAO

[2:49:06] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus keep in mind you are in an invincible state during glory kills. sometimes delaying one to use it a bit later as a dodge from a hell knight charge can be useful
[2:49:07] <+PenmanLupine> woolie Paniced
[2:49:07] <%Solidnick18> BURNING
[2:49:09] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus you can also save the jobbers and use them as walking healthpacks while you focus on hellknight.
[2:49:17] <+boosh5> Bigger gun.
[2:49:18] <+GeneralHysterics> I love how as the game goes on you just get used to fighting hell knights and taking on 3 or 4 at a time ain't no thang
[2:49:19] <praisedasun_> RE2 flashbacks
[2:49:20] <+dasmause> its not even a cyberdemon
[2:49:21] <JaywalkingKnight> Saiba Demon
[2:49:28] <Yummy_Nukes> BOB and WEAVE
[2:49:28] <%croxeye> use alt fire from shotgun more, it's a great use
[2:49:28] <+GeneralHysterics> They don't get easier, you get better
[2:49:28] <saltysmyth> That ain't no fucking cyberdemon
[2:49:31] <%Solidnick18> Try the rpg @chesterr01
[2:49:32] <dukenux> big gun for big guy
[2:49:34] <+TaphexWin> Rocket launcher on the Hell Knight
[2:49:34] <%ozzrabbit> Woolie, CIRCLE STRAFE! Treat these guys like they’re Diabolos in Monster Hunter!
[2:49:36] <ShoggothLord> Hell Knights are SCARY (when you're a low-level bitch)
[2:49:38] <Tucker0603> that ain't no cyberdemon
[2:49:42] <%DesertPenguin> You need to switch your weapons up more often. Holding the switch button slows time
[2:49:43] <ghostspartan80> use the rockets woolie
[2:49:44] <JaywalkingKnight> You take on 2 Hell barons at a time in a cramped space like they're total chumps
[2:49:48] <%allups> strafe side to side instead of just running
[2:49:48] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1224743712657412096?s=19
[2:49:56] <%DesertPenguin> Hold the switch weapon button to slow time for a breather
[2:50:02] <+spiraljoel> Theme for the Slayer's Club fanart gallery this month is Glory Kills so I'm redrawing the God Hand cover

[2:50:06] <Lavrohas> big oof
[2:50:06] <adamisfruit> That’s no cyber demon, you’ll fucking know when it’s the cyber demon
[2:50:08] <jorniev> this is a brute was it? duke? i dont remeber
[2:50:09] <%Louie_Salmon> There's a reason there's an entire game just called STRAFE in this genre
[2:50:10] <Lavrohas> he taking MAD damage lmao
[2:50:15] <+spiraljoel> @jorniev Hell Knight

[2:51:06] <%Exiliator> Standing still is for LOSERS.. And the DEAD
[2:51:07] <%Pigg1yJuffs> I would've completed the hell out of this game trophywise, if not for the fact that the multiplayer may as well be non-existent at this point.
[2:51:11] <Lightwolfe> seeing this played with a controller looks like misery compared to the m+kb
[2:51:12] <+GeneralHysterics> MORE BOOM MORE ZOOM
[2:51:12] <ghostspartan80> go for health
[2:51:14] <%omenzazu> @rsg220 tell that to the Doom guy
[2:51:15] <dukenux> Doom is a ballet sim

[2:51:30] <jorniev> if you are not moving you are not killing!
[2:51:37] <%Louie_Salmon> I don't mean this to sound rude, but I've never considered how hard a shooter would be if you only shoot in the same direction you're moving
[2:51:40] <jorniev> health
[2:51:42] <JaywalkingKnight> Rather buttclench than take health LUL
[2:51:46] <%croxeye> yeah pretty much unfortanately it looks like his setup won't support mouse and keyboard for a while, it's def the best way to play doom
[2:51:47] <DeathByPoke7> if you hold down the weapon wheel it will slow time
[2:51:50] <%Lion_kun> Hes rynning around like a mad man instesd of picking targets and shooting

[2:57:50] <JaywalkingKnight> Let's get into fighting games for fun doom
[2:58:02] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus dont forget you have upgrade points to spend. you havent spent them since getting the combat shotty
[2:58:18] <Driftrift> wow never noticed that awesome fog effect below the spawner before.
[2:58:31] <+YabbaTroll> hollywood is too cowardly for mick
[2:58:38] <%Exiliator> That was smooth woolieGASM
[2:58:47] <+spiraljoel> nobody remembers mick did tracks for lawbreakers
[2:58:56] <%Exiliator> ...That was not woolieWUT
[2:59:00] <Camail> doom: the calm down
[2:59:01] <%Louie_Salmon> nobody remembers lawbreakers
[2:59:05] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus dont forget you have upgrade points to spend. you havent spent them since getting the combat shotty
[2:59:13] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus keep in mind; energy attribute. geuss what energy weapon is good against; PLASMA SHIELDS
[2:59:15] <%Prevot> were his tracks woke tho
[2:59:22] <%Pigg1yJuffs> Cause no one remembers lawbreakers except Cliffy B.
[2:59:26] <JaywalkingKnight> Oh? Mick did tracks for lawbreakers? Cool, should listen to ost then
[2:59:43] <%S3xGAZEBO> This has me so stoked for the new doom
[2:59:54] <%kyh9> Lock On Burst
[2:59:55] <%RioGascar> @woolieversus i dont think micks music would work as well in movies because they arent dynamic tracks like video games have that can adapt to the dynamics of a scene in game
[2:59:55] <%allups> Bring back Lawbreakers
[3:00:00] <%DesertPenguin> SPEEDY
[3:00:03] <+Neoepochx> @Lavrohas It is good, but it they buffed plasma vs the shield in eternal. Which I'm glad for.
[3:00:06] <Driftrift> lol @Prevot beat me to it
[3:00:15] <+TaphexWin> Explosive shot is always good
[3:00:15] <+linSP> doom on them psaDab
[3:00:17] <%DesertPenguin> Missiles aren't used that much TBH
[3:00:19] <+nekodelic> wait for super shotgun
[3:00:21] <+Javaa01> Ammo Efficiency is always important
[3:00:32] <$Swish20XX> Quick lock is good
[3:00:39] <%DesertPenguin> speedy recover on regular shotgu
[3:00:43] <Lavrohas> @Neoepochx that is def good. Def want woolie aware there is at least an energy weapon weakness to those shields, since hes having issues with the shield guys @WoolieVersus
[3:00:44] <%DesertPenguin> DON'T TELL HIM EVERYTHING C'MON WTF
[3:00:46] <SilverInferno3> Fully kitted SS is no joke
[3:00:57] <DatAsuna> Plasma and Shotgun were my faves
[3:00:57] <%DesertPenguin> There will be enough later
[3:01:01] <%Irridium> You're gonna have more than enough upgrade points if you replay stuff don't worry about it
[3:01:04] <$Swish20XX> Idk if Woolie will like the super shotgun
[3:01:05] <Nested_Dreams> Bottomless Missiles with infinite ammo rune Kreygasm Kreygasm
[3:01:07] <OkamiDude15> double shot on super shotty nkoGasm
[3:01:18] <JaywalkingKnight> Yeah, fully graded SS is just better than regular shotty, mods don't help out there
[3:01:27] <%DesertPenguin> The Explosive Shot is really useful on the shotgun so it's best to make it available as quickly as possble
[3:01:38] <@chesterr01> voice volume okay now with my face on the mic?
[3:01:48] <%S3xGAZEBO> Micro missiles are a problem solver.
[3:01:49] <Lavrohas> @chesterr01 perfect
[3:01:50] <$Swish20XX> You can jump down where the lava is for the doll
[3:01:59] <+nekodelic> @desertpenguin he has it already, I think
[3:02:01] <+TaphexWin> @chesterr01 yeah, you’re good
[3:02:03] <Andrei11Droasca> @woolieversus You can upgrade the suite
[3:02:03] <Driftrift> "Have you tried our new Bottomless Missiles?"
[3:02:07] <@chesterr01> SeemsGood
[3:02:10] <%DesertPenguin> yea, so he should get the speedy recover upgrade for it
[3:02:54] <+SgtSociopath> Your discovery radius is so big that it marked part of it. The gray part is where you get into it.

[3:06:26] <rsg220> devs took great lengths to woolie proof this game
[3:06:36] <+SirGO0SE> SourPls
[3:06:42] <+YabbaTroll> SourPls
[3:06:43] <%Exiliator> It is very KI isnt it? woolieSMUG
[3:06:46] <SainEdge> SourPls
[3:06:48] <+Belysning> SourPls
[3:06:53] <rsg220> every time you think you have enough bass you're fucking wrong
[3:06:55] <JaywalkingKnight> >KI Kappa
[3:06:57] <+Grayhammatter> big slaps
[3:07:01] <Driftrift> The Foundry is probably my favorite level. I could repeat it for hours.
[3:07:04] <xdeathknightx> Gotta get some of dem Beats, crap for anything besides ton of bass
[3:07:05] <+SirGO0SE> bless you mick
[3:07:06] <Lavrohas> this still isnt BFG Divison. that BASS ON THAT SONG
[3:07:06] <+RichardMF_> @exiliator same composer, Mick Gordon
[3:07:08] <%DesertPenguin> switch between this and the shotgun
[3:07:11] <+TaphexWin> Real question is: Cinders theme or BFG Division?
[3:07:15] <fist_wizard_jay> Im buying the whole album for Eternal
[3:07:19] <%K2YP70C0CK> atpHorns woolieOMG 'll
[3:07:23] <Lavrohas> bfg division no question sorry cinder
[3:07:24] <+YabbaTroll> just wait till he hears the Hell Guard theme
[3:07:26] <+TaphexWin> Both answers are correct
[3:07:30] <+Grayhammatter> he played himself
[3:07:34] <ghostspartan80> bfg division imo
[3:07:40] <+GeneralHysterics> this room a fuck
[3:08:02] <ghostspartan80> the first proper arena
[3:08:04] <Arnoldoaad1> yeah, this room is hard
[3:08:12] <mesamus> pat sends his regards, saying he's happy you are enjoying Doom
[3:08:14] <%Exiliator> bfg division so good
[3:08:23] <+TaphexWin> Yeah, Hell Razor’s Fulgore beam is deadly if you stand still
[3:08:25] <+YabbaTroll> they def can in the old dooms
[3:08:25] <Skeletonmanners> yea there's friendly fire in this game
[3:08:27] <+Neoepochx> Infighting can occur in this game.
[3:08:27] <BallerSwagBro9k> Its a mechanics since Doom 1
[3:08:28] <DeathByPoke7> yes enemies have friendly fire
[3:08:30] <thesoothe> They can infight right, it's rare?
[3:08:32] <rsg220> need three ticks of fuel for hell knights
[3:08:34] <+commanderclaw> That kind of thing happens, enemies can even aggro each other
[3:08:35] <+TaphexWin> Yes, they can
[3:08:35] <%S3xGAZEBO> riggity rekt
[3:08:38] <%Irridium> Enemies can in fact shoot each other
[3:08:39] <$Swish20XX> It happens here. You'll see later
[3:08:40] <JaywalkingKnight> Easy modo has ended
[3:08:42] <%DesertPenguin> Use the shotgun more
[3:08:44] <popcultureaficionado> Pat said you where playing doom and I came over immediately lol.
[3:08:47] <ghostspartan80> they fight each other sometimes
[3:08:48] <Graxe_> Bigger or harder enemies take more gas
[3:08:53] <+Neoepochx> Big boiz need 3+
[3:08:53] <Graxe_> To saw
[3:08:54] <%Exiliator> @mesamus clip?
[3:08:55] <thesoothe> They don't glory kill each other, it's a shame.
[3:09:02] <%S3xGAZEBO> Shotgun is your friend here
[3:09:02] <%DesertPenguin> Assault Rifle is for DPS against larger enemies only use it against that Hell Knight
[3:09:03] <ghostspartan80> 3 fuels for hell knight
[3:09:28] <%omenzazu> hope he sets the double jump in this run
[3:09:29] <MrBorisMakarov> MrBorisMakarov subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! 
[3:09:36] <+spiraljoel> You can't really take that much advantage of it in '16, it's more a factor in classic doom
[3:09:37] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus keep in mind; energy attribute is somewhat a thing . geuss what energy weapon is good against; PLASMA SHIELDS. saw you were having issues with shield bois so keep that plasma rifle in mind.
[3:09:48] <+TaphexWin> Shooting the Hell Knight in the head with the Assault Rifle frees him up
[3:09:48] <%DesertPenguin> It's a lot to take it right now but you have a lot of options at your disposal. Try them all out
[3:09:57] <rsg220> Doom guys scopin' the joint before the killing
[3:09:58] <@chesterr01> @lavrohas yep we saw!
[3:10:09] <Lavrohas> @chesterr01 k just makin sure :3
[3:10:11] <MeinKampfyC0uch> like an action game, you can get kinda overwhelmed with how many options you have in combat scenarios
[3:10:24] <@chesterr01> SeemsGood
[3:10:27] <+TaphexWin> C O M B A T P U Z Z L E
[3:10:31] <Lavrohas> thats the beauty of doom. so much options
[3:10:37] <ShershaAD> @woolieversus hey woolz, i recemtly pucked up sf5 for the free week, im curious as to where you would rank it in the series
[3:11:09] <%S3xGAZEBO> Use the machine gun against smaller or far away dudes. Switch to shotgun for big guys/close guys. Don't try and chase down the speedy dudes running from you with the shotgun.
[3:11:11] <ghostspartan80> this game is truly something if one if the starter weapons is a shotgun with a grenade launcher
[3:11:33] <+TheBigTaco> This game is definitely easier to control on pc
[3:11:33] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1224743712657412096?s=19
[3:11:34] <Lavrohas> how fuckin crazy would it be if eyedol and gargos was just chilling here in doom
[3:11:39] <%Solidnick18> SourPls
[3:11:42] <%Exiliator> SourPls SourPls SourPls
[3:11:47] <SainEdge> SourPls
[3:11:58] <Halospaz117> Are you feeling it now Mr Reggie?
[3:12:05] <%Exiliator> Turn it up to eleven!
[3:12:18] <%Broand> woolieGASM
[3:12:37] <Lightwolfe> you literally tried the same thing
[3:12:38] <Lavrohas> reggie "mr freshN' fly" seems like hes HELLa enjoying it Kappa @chesterr01
[3:12:38] <+GeneralHysterics> NOW THERE ARE TWO OF THEM. This is getting out of hand
[3:12:38] <DeathByPoke7> dont forget about your other weapons
[3:12:39] <%Broand> 3 fuel
[3:12:40] <+Grayhammatter> get stomped
[3:12:40] <Speccu_> its crazy this runs on switch
[3:12:42] <$Swish20XX> 3
[3:12:42] <%Irridium> BODIED
[3:12:43] <SilverInferno3> 3
[3:12:43] <Halospaz117> 3
[3:12:43] <badmr7> 3 pips
[3:12:44] <%Solidnick18> 3
[3:12:45] <Djinnazz> 3
[3:12:45] <Tucker0603> 3
[3:12:45] <%Exiliator> 3
[3:12:45] <FuqBoiSlim> SNUFFED
[3:12:45] <%Irridium> 3
[3:12:45] <+Grayhammatter> they take 3
[3:12:45] <SheefEatsBeef> they take 3 pipds
[3:12:45] <%S3xGAZEBO> It takes extra fuel for big dudes
[3:12:47] <gunsrlove> 3 out of 5
[3:12:48] <mikesapartment> save the chainsaw for double trouble
[3:12:48] <Lavrohas> 3 fuel
[3:12:48] <$Swish20XX> You have 5 now
[3:12:50] <+Javaa01> Mid size enemies take 3
[3:12:50] <+nekodelic> same mistake
[3:12:52] <ghostspartan80> you definitely need to pay attention lol
[3:12:53] <rsg220> you have five max, you need 3 to kill
[3:12:54] <SilverInferno3> You have 5
[3:12:54] <+Order_of_Mystery> rockets my friend
[3:12:54] <Djinnazz> you have 5
[3:12:55] <+Javaa01> BIG BOIS take 5
[3:12:57] <+TaphexWin> Takes 3 amounts of fuel
[3:13:01] <Lavrohas> thats why we save the fuel for big boys instead of using it on small fry @WoolieVersus
[3:13:07] <jalexmcc> If only you had a rocket launcher
[3:13:10] <%Exiliator> HELLWAVE DarkMode
[3:13:19] <Driftrift> lol i've been in a different tab and the glory kills sound like sound like doomslayer is stepping on an open bag of all dressed
[3:13:21] <%S3xGAZEBO> Use machine gun for the imps, switch to shotgun for big/aggro dudes. Don't try and chase down the imps with the shotgun.
[3:13:32] <Nested_Dreams> CurseLit TehePelo CurseLit
[3:13:32] <$Swish20XX> IMO quick target is great for rocket launcher upgrade
[3:13:33] <Lavrohas> HELLWAVE YOU SAY??
[3:13:37] <ClearMindedFury> I'm glad that Woolie is enjoying Doom but daaang I don't miss playing FPS' with a gamepad.
[3:13:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> Your capacity is FIVE WOOLIE
[3:13:43] <MeinKampfyC0uch> chainsaw should be a last resort, only if you need ammo or REALLY need to one-shot something
[3:13:43] <ghostspartan80> why isn't he using the rock launcher
[3:13:56] <Cykron> Big Toys for Big Boys
[3:14:02] <rsg220> probably forgot he has it
[3:14:12] <$Swish20XX> He doesn't have to use anything. I fight most stuff with shotguns
[3:14:27] <ghostspartan80> hes struggling tho
[3:14:27] <Lavrohas> @ghostspartan80 probably because he runs out of ammo and also hurts himself with it, so he switches off and then forgets
[3:14:34] <LtKregorov> You probably play at easy difficulty tho
[3:14:38] <$Swish20XX> He'll get better
[3:14:50] <$Swish20XX> Ultra Violence
[3:14:51] <%S3xGAZEBO> @ClearMindedFury By gamepad you mean just the standard controller? Is there a better way to play FPSs? Like a special controller?
[3:14:54] <%Exiliator> Hes improbed massively since level 1
[3:15:03] <ghostspartan80> also does he know theres a weapon wheel
[3:15:03] <%Exiliator> *imroved woolieWUT
[3:15:06] <%Exiliator> f me
[3:15:11] <Lavrohas> he does know yes
[3:15:15] <%Exiliator> IMPROVED
[3:15:25] <Driftrift> fps by guitar hero controller
[3:15:25] <+nekodelic> @s3xgazebo with mouse
[3:15:34] <LtKregorov> I mean, you can clear the game using only one gun, I know, I did it with pistol on ultra nightmare, but it will make it much easier if you use the power weapong
[3:15:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> @s3xgazebo Have you heard of M+KB?
[3:15:35] <ClearMindedFury> @S3xGAZEBO yeah. just km/b
[3:15:37] <%drefizz> Sure Exiliator, don't tempt me with a goo time
[3:15:37] <+Grayhammatter> standing still is death
[3:15:44] <rsg220> just play doom with a fight stick
[3:15:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> @clearmindedfury Keymoard and bouse?
[3:16:02] <%S3xGAZEBO> Oh that makes sense
[3:16:16] <ClearMindedFury> @GeneralSCPatton EXACTLY
[3:16:20] <ShoggothLord> Woolie use rockets
[3:16:26] <jalexmcc> use the rocket launcher
[3:16:30] <FuqBoiSlim> my man's running in circles looking for those shields lmao
[3:16:33] <%Solidnick18> OH
[3:16:34] <Lavrohas> lol map awareness where you AT
[3:16:37] <Personified134> woolie you have a rocket launcher
[3:16:38] <Lavrohas> WHERE YOUR CURLY MUSTACHE AT
[3:16:43] <rsg220> one hell knight beats you down and the other one is the HYPE MAN
[3:16:44] <gunsrlove> BIG EXCITE
[3:16:46] <$Swish20XX> Don't be afraid to jump around
[3:16:46] <%S3xGAZEBO> Or just kite him with the shotgun
[3:16:46] <UnfilteredComic> I love that they know how to Power Dunk
[3:16:48] <%Solidnick18> he curbed stomped you
[3:16:51] <+bubbli97> what difficulty are they playing?
[3:16:52] <%Solidnick18> lol
[3:16:52] <JaywalkingKnight> Stick to the pads in the center, should be easier
[3:16:53] <Driftrift> @rsg220 do you thing dragon motion makes him do an uppercut?
[3:16:53] <+Neoepochx> The radial menu will slow time down for you.
[3:16:56] <%Irridium> might wanna save the chainsaw for when you're fighting the two, that way you can drop it to a 1v1 real quick
[3:16:58] <+UrielCobalt> I beat them with the pulse rifle
[3:17:01] <%S3xGAZEBO> Like do what the imps do. Kite them and pepper them with the shotgun
[3:17:06] <Lightwolfe> just muscle memory it lmao
[3:17:06] <+RichardMF_> @bubbli97 normals
[3:17:07] <+Neoepochx> Also, things will come naturally after time.
[3:17:16] <+Neoepochx> Since you haven't played a ton of shooters anyway.
[3:17:22] <+Neoepochx> It'll be muscle memory ezpz
[3:17:28] <Plugman86> above everything else, woolie needs to improve his situational awareness
[3:17:29] <Andrei11Droasca> You got a wepin weel
[3:17:30] <+TaphexWin> This is great because there’s SO MANY options at your disposal, like the chat was saying earlier
[3:17:40] <+TheBigTaco> @rsg220 oh no the demons are hyping each other
[3:17:43] <%S3xGAZEBO> Mele when they are not glowing isn't super useful in this game
[3:17:51] <Andrei11Droasca> weapon wheel*
[3:17:52] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus @chesterr01 if woolie needs a moment midfight to switch/assess the situation, bringing up the weapon wheel IMMENSELY slows down time
[3:17:54] <Plugman86> he seems to not be 100% aware of his own position relative to the map, much less enemies
[3:18:09] <ghostspartan80> lp tax gonna come in handy
[3:18:16] <Nested_Dreams> Tbh this section wasn't easy even on m+kb
[3:18:20] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[3:18:20] <Lavrohas> these are not the games he usually plays. hes doing extremely well despite that
[3:18:26] <ClearMindedFury> he's just having fun and getting lost in the carnage
[3:18:33] <CoffeeSlice> clever!
[3:18:34] <+Grayhammatter> nice idea woolie
[3:18:34] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:18:35] <+Neoepochx> Eventually, you will kinda instinctively know how to threat assess for which guys to murder.

[3:26:06] <+primax104> Vega's cool
[3:26:08] <MeinKampfyC0uch> musical homage to OG Doom here
[3:26:18] <%allups> it looks like shes knows whatt shes messing with
[3:26:19] <Lavrohas> @chesterr01 if he wants to get to that big room, theres a lever near that middle area with the first hell knight where yall were forcing that hell knight into a jumping loop over a gap in lava. t
[3:26:26] <+Neoepochx> Vega <3
[3:26:28] <Vyneci> Fun fact, if you get here fast enough, this cutscene glitches and her hud doesn't go past the lock screen, so it looks like she's interacting with nothing
[3:26:29] <Pyraxy> moon2PH

[3:27:55] <%Louie_Salmon> Missing out on those challenges but I think you can beat the game without tons of upgrades

[3:28:29] <+spiraljoel> Welcome to the CLUB woolz
[3:28:32] <Driftrift> oh is this the first time he's played doom?
[3:28:33] <a1337spy> woolie, i really recommend you play the classic doom games at some point as well
[3:28:34] <%omenzazu> sum good chet
[3:28:36] <milk2b> so, when's ULTRAKILL?
[3:28:40] <a1337spy> they aged gracefully
[3:28:42] <%Louie_Salmon> It's almost like your goblins are locking you out of entire amazing genre
[3:28:45] <Lightwolfe> Based righteous violence
[3:28:57] <%S3xGAZEBO> I forgot how fun doom was. I should fire it back up myself.
[3:28:58] <+primax104> Col
[3:28:59] <Yummy_Nukes> @woolieversus do you feel like a good Christian boy fighting the demons?
[3:29:00] <+primax104> Cool
[3:29:02] <+RichardMF_> Do you feel like a badass yet?
[3:29:02] <splatterroomtacos> What time is it? ITS TIME FOR DOOM
[3:29:02] <%croxeye> btw if you didn't see it before, you can move the guns to the center of the screen, there's no gameplay benefit, but it looks really cool
[3:29:07] <%Irridium> @Louie_Salmon I mean, it's mainly the motion sickness
[3:29:08] <danieln0> Doom's like DMC5 of shooters
[3:29:08] <Vyneci> You guys HAVE to watch a speedrun of this game once you're done or at least to where you're at, it's fucking INSANE
[3:29:08] <%Exiliator> That sweet sweet Super Violence
[3:29:12] <xdeathknightx> Friendship with Spec Ops: The Line ended, now Doom is Woolie's best friend
[3:29:13] <Pyraxy> It gets better
[3:29:15] <Andrei11Droasca> Did he upgrade the suite at all ?
[3:29:20] <+Javaa01> 40-something days
[3:29:20] <ManlyMcBeefington> good session
[3:29:24] <%Ecchigun> ooooHh
[3:29:24] <%RioGascar> @woolieversus friendship ended with fighting games? Now shooters are best friend?
[3:29:25] <%Louie_Salmon> @irridium Fair, that's a bit more than a goblin
[3:29:29] <ghostspartan80> good business
[3:29:30] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus at some point either offstream or as a .5 episode or something, you can always do some cleanup and redo some missions to get those extras. up to you, but it would def help the LP alot to get you those upgrades. make everything alot smoother.

[3:31:18] <+NotHereToStream> minh was executed for his war crime Kappa
[3:31:18] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus at some point either offstream or as a .5 episode or something, you can always do some cleanup and redo some missions to get those extras. up to you, but it would def help the LP alot to get you those upgrades. make everything alot smoother.
[3:31:22] <%omenzazu> keeping tabs on that
[3:31:22] <+Neoepochx> To quote Civvie, Romero made the equivalent of "Thriller"

[3:33:16] <%S3xGAZEBO> I'm really surprised that default controllers for system don't just come with paddles on the back
[3:33:18] <+admiral_of_crunch> @jetpackmcquack Just jam your thumb in sideways
[3:33:25] <SilverInferno3> Yesss
[3:33:26] <%croxeye> @WoolieVersus you gonna try out the DS4 back button attachment to see if you'll like the DS5?

[3:33:43] <Ether101_Prime> You get something special if you upgrade both paths on a weapon.
[3:33:44] <%Louie_Salmon> I've never read the lore sections, I am excited
[3:33:58] <rsg220> lol no fucking way
[3:33:58] <gunsrlove> That's objectively WRONG
[3:34:00] <+Cymen90> Bungie gunfeel WutFace
[3:34:02] <%kyh9> Halo 1 is the good shit
[3:34:03] <%Louie_Salmon> Halo 3 and COD 4 are just good campaigns. I can hope
[3:34:05] <Djinnazz> Halo yes, Destiny no.
[3:34:06] <%S3xGAZEBO> The fact that adding a touch pad to the controller before putting buttons on the back is crazy
[3:34:07] <Speccu_> just play marathon lol
[3:34:07] <JaywalkingKnight> OOOOOOF
[3:34:08] <ghostspartan80> in one of the levels they literally read the lore to you lol
[3:34:10] <+Javaa01> Halo gunfeel is mediocre by modern standards
[3:34:12] <%Exiliator> eeeh..
[3:34:13] <%Solidnick18> destiny no way
[3:34:16] <+dosan121> That has to be sarcasm lmao
[3:34:18] <+Neoepochx> New Blood has the best gun feel.
[3:34:20] <sasparillatango> Bedge your Hets
[3:34:24] <%allups> dESTINY IS THE BAD GAME
[3:34:24] <%omenzazu> >Destiny
[3:34:27] <DeathByPoke7> bungie=auto aim
[3:34:30] <+Javaa01> Destiny gunfeel is better, but not the best
[3:34:33] <JaywalkingKnight> New Blood - like Dusk gunfeel?
[3:34:42] <%Sxy_T_Rex> Deep Rock Galactic > Destiny
[3:34:42] <Speccu_> don't tell his mom
[3:34:43] <%Louie_Salmon> @javaa01 The vehicles and gimmick levels are the cooler part really
[3:34:44] <SilverInferno3> Too biblical
[3:34:45] <JaywalkingKnight> Foight Satem
[3:34:46] <%jiggy_snipe> Woolie starts Destiny and the podcast becomes the Destinycast with Pat WutFace
[3:34:46] <%Exiliator> Woolie woolieVS Killing Floor 1 tho... woolieYE
[3:34:47] <+Neoepochx> Dusk and Amid Evil

[3:35:13] <splatterroomtacos> RIP AND TEAR UNTIL IT IS DONE
[3:35:21] <%S3xGAZEBO> The doomslayer was portrayed super cool in this game.
[3:35:23] <Lavrohas> @WoolieVersus at some point either offstream or as a .5 episode or something, you can always do some cleanup and redo some missions to get those extras. up to you, but it would def help the LP alot to get you those upgrades. make everything alot smoother.
[3:35:26] <+Neoepochx> @Sxy_T_Rex The boomer shooter renaissance feels so good.

[3:36:18] <velestionhammer> Woolie VS Doctor Hell
[3:36:19] <%S3xGAZEBO> They manage to keep this game going pretty well and keeping the hype high without just flooding more and more bullshit at you until each fight is a slog. It was put together very well.

[0:09:55] <%relentingapunch> VoHiYo500 Heya Woolz. Been wondering about somethin for a while. As a person living in the midwest, I've never had any kind of local FGC scene. As such, modes like P4U2's story and golden bathhouse were things I put a good amount of time into. I was wondering, should fighting games put time into some sort of single player component for people in my situation, or is it just a waste of resources? Cheers.

[0:17:24] <@akuda_bar> disco elysium is amazeballs
[0:17:35] <%RedoctoberWolf> thats on my wishlist
[0:17:38] <Iwashi94> it's like 20 hours
[0:17:39] <%gatorafan> I'm super hyped for PSO2 2
[0:17:45] <%kyh9> It has some fantastic moments
[0:17:47] <+Creggamonsta> same woolie.
[0:17:49] <brian_peppers1> @chosenjuan42 Can't hear you take those burgers outta your filthy mouth!
[0:17:51] <penitentpentwitch> It's a good game, but GOD is it antithesis of a streaming game.
[0:17:51] <@akuda_bar> it's 20-30, yeah, but it begs for replay. it's also not fun to stream it though.
[0:17:56] <%kyh9> Not really streamable
[0:17:57] <%Irridium> Honestly it would be best to play it on your own
[0:18:00] <pory_z> just play it on your own
[0:18:00] <+thackattack00> just play it for yourself man
[0:18:01] <%Exiliator> Fuck yes it is
[0:18:01] <%kyh9> The Anti-Stream game
[0:18:03] <%relentingapunch> Not really a streamable game
[0:18:10] <Drusain> Kinda the same problem with Planescape Torment
[0:18:10] <@akuda_bar> it's definitely not a stream. but it's fun.
[0:18:11] <+Creggamonsta> Day9 is playing it
[0:18:15] <+Creggamonsta> its goina pretty good
[0:18:15] <Ashenik1> Woolie witcher 3 is a better game to lets play :>
[0:18:16] <%relentingapunch> It is anti-stream, moreso than Danganronpa
[0:18:17] <penitentpentwitch> Play it offscreen, along with watching Korra
[0:18:18] <%Exiliator> Your idea of lets plays is ancient old man!
[0:18:20] <cosmicgoatee> announcing the new fable was pretty neato
[0:18:24] <+gus_hornblende> It has partial voice acting, but yeah it is a lot of reading
[0:18:24] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[0:18:27] <JetpackMcQuack> Text to speech Jebaited
[0:18:28] <%saraizarai> Wasn't disco voiced?
[0:18:29] <%kyh9> Voice acting is expensive, and they're just 8 Estonian commies
[0:18:32] <+Zutrax> Game has voice acting during main story bits I think. But yeah mostly reading
[0:18:36] <%relentingapunch> DA aint voiced
[0:18:38] <+DukeBlack_> Ad lib
[0:18:39] <%kyh9> @saraizarai Only partially
[0:18:41] <Drusain> It has SOME voice activing
[0:18:41] <%ringabal> Maxed out Exposition build. Let's go.
[0:18:43] <@akuda_bar> @saraizarai only 10% of the lines
[0:18:47] <+linSP> Disco is kinda voiced
[0:18:52] <brian_peppers1> Woolie will love The Witcher 3 but he will NEVER play it.
[0:18:52] <penitentpentwitch> It'd cost WAY TOO MUCH if there was voice acting
[0:18:54] <%LastHazzerd> oh this is not on the devs at all.
[0:18:58] <%kyh9> Original Sin 2 got fully voiced as a stretch goal
[0:19:05] <+gus_hornblende> Reggie's reactions to some of those moments would be gold
[0:19:06] <JetpackMcQuack> AI voice actors are on the horizon btw
[0:19:09] <LBC921> I see woolie got into the saints
[0:19:16] <%LastHazzerd> It is not a video game dev's responsibility to make things easy for LPers
[0:19:16] <hassanico2> Hey chat, just came in, what game?
[0:19:17] <@akuda_bar> ancient reptile brain has the best fucking voice
[0:19:21] <derap41> man Reggie why you not color coding ?
[0:19:26] <hassanico2> oooh, Disco?
[0:19:36] <$BallerSwagBro9k> I like it but it uses too many big words for me
[0:19:41] <%saraizarai> Huh, gotcha
[0:19:42] <%chosenjuan42> woolieKICKDAD woolieVS woolieOMG
[0:19:42] <@akuda_bar> yeah. i just wouldn't recommend even trying it but that's just me
[0:19:50] <irregularly_irregular> Did Woolie watch the Xbox conference... thing?
[0:19:52] <+Creggamonsta> ill read it for you. fuck it
[0:19:52] <hassanico2> Disco is VN tier which is SUPER dangerous for LP videos LUL
[0:20:00] <pory_z> i think you can adjust the text size
[0:20:01] <brian_peppers1> Wait for the iPAD version
[0:20:01] <%Irridium> Could y'all imagine the backseating on a Disco LP LUL
[0:20:04] <@akuda_bar> it's very much not even a game you wanna play with someone else around, it's aggressively singleplayer
[0:20:09] <Ashenik1> Woolie witcher 3 maybe then ???
[0:20:14] <%Exiliator> People already do that, so
[0:20:23] <+Ryu_R> @hassanico2 a VN without anime is double dangerous for LPs
[0:20:24] <hassanico2> @Irridium entire chat is cop brain
[0:20:25] <+linSP> it’s a fun story game
[0:20:25] <+Miles_Hikari> nicobThink
[0:20:36] <penitentpentwitch> You'd need Minh and Reggie to help with voices, and even THAT is a stretch.
[0:20:50] <+DarkestVegemite> Text-to-speech!
[0:20:52] <$BallerSwagBro9k> @Ashenik1 Thats an 80 hour+ game. It's take Woolie over a year
[0:20:52] <%BisoromiBear> hire 10 bums
[0:20:54] <%relentingapunch> Getting both Minh and Reggie to help would still be a LOT
[0:21:00] <+Creggamonsta> just play it and talk about it on the podcasts
[0:21:06] <JetpackMcQuack> Hire voice actors
[0:21:08] <Ashenik1> @BallerSwagBro9k and....? Kappa

[0:21:30] <@akuda_bar> @kyh9 wait is it wonderworld or wonderland, i feel like i'm being gaslit
[0:21:32] <%exnuart> halo infinite looking like hot garbage
[0:21:32] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Fun fact most of Halo's plot is based on the book of Daniel
[0:21:37] <Drusain> The H in Halo stands for Halo
[0:21:40] <Esparsenior> Am I going crazy but I’m 99% sure Disco Elysium has voice acting
[0:21:42] <%ringabal> You dare besmirch the word of our lord Jimmy Halo!?
[0:21:43] <DeepSearch27> When will Woolie play "Bible: 3" or "Bible: ODST"
[0:21:43] <$BallerSwagBro9k> Look it up on the wiki
[0:21:44] <%relentingapunch> evo15MindBlown
[0:21:45] <%saraizarai> Disco isn't "that" long, steam says I beat it in 22hrs
[0:21:51] <@akuda_bar> @Esparsenior it only has 10% voice acting
[0:21:51] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Cant escape GOD
[0:21:54] <%SmokerWest> The L in Halo stand s for Leviticus

[0:26:58] <+r_Foeburden87> Primarina tho
[0:27:03] <penitentpentwitch> I liked Blastoise the most of the initial three starter evolutions. Mostly because it was the most unique looking.
[0:27:05] <cosmicgoatee> Squirtle Squad
[0:27:10] <missingangle> Blastoise is fucking rad
[0:27:12] <%relentingapunch> Squirtle Squad ALL DAY
[0:27:20] <@Solidus_113> And nobody wanted the plant
[0:27:23] <%LastHazzerd> is that why Blue was the one in america?
[0:27:24] <Drusain> I like Wartortle because he reminds me a valkyrie from VP
[0:27:24] <%SmokerWest> Blastoise is so dumb
[0:27:27] <+RyTYoung> Squirtle is the best looking starter
[0:27:29] <pory_z> i wanted the plant ;_;
[0:27:29] <cosmicgoatee> I Stanstoised

[0:27:37] <%DrDestro> sorry but inteleon snipes blastoides
[0:27:42] <cosmicgoatee> Wartortle was super cool too
[0:27:47] <+RyTYoung> Digimon are RAD
[0:27:51] <HereComestheChief> ItsHappening
[0:27:51] <Hyper_charger> vinesaur where its at
[0:27:58] <%kyh9> Singleplayer should double as tutorials
[0:27:58] <+inkthepeasant> come to the Milwaukee FGC scene
[0:28:07] <+inkthepeasant> weirdly somewhat active Tekken scene
[0:28:10] <%kyh9> The Single Player should teach the players the higher-level tactics
[0:28:10] <%DrDestro> digiwho?
[0:28:11] <%andrex2311> Granblue single player is fun
[0:28:13] <Hyper_charger> MK is the best example
[0:28:14] <%SmokerWest> MK9 was fun
[0:28:15] <missingangle> A lot of people don't want JUST a fighting game
[0:28:19] <cosmicgoatee> @rytyoung the new 2020 digimon anime is pretty good
[0:28:20] <notsoy> i mean, mortal kombat and injustice do their single-player stuff very well and make TONS of money
[0:28:22] <@Solidus_113> Fighting Herds!
[0:28:23] <+UberWolfman> SFV LUL
[0:28:31] <Iam_Dead> God the p4A and p4AU challenge modes suck
[0:28:32] <%TheLemuroid> Imagine bad single player AND bad netcode
[0:28:34] <%HollowedIdjit> a single player mode should teach you something as well sa the story
[0:28:38] <$BallerSwagBro9k> MK 9-11 story is great dumb fun
[0:28:40] <+RyTYoung> @cosmicgoatee yeah I've been keeping up with it, it's a nice spin on the original anime
[0:28:43] <%SomersaultJustice> for a long time I've wanted a sequel to Red Earth for this reason, with customizable moves and leveling
[0:28:51] <irregularly_irregular> I don't have the time to "get gud" at fighting games but I enjoy them nonetheless... so the single-player mode they did in Granblue was dope
[0:28:52] <%andrex2311> Granblue being a beaten-up is the best to me
[0:28:54] <%Irridium> I'm honestly fine with just an arcade mode with a little ending for each character.
[0:28:55] <%jinking79> reason y SFV sucked
[0:29:27] <GenericSoda> tekken bowl
[0:29:29] <hassanico2> I like SWR's Story Mode :)
[0:29:40] <%relentingapunch> Golden Arena was a great mode that wasn't as fleshed out as it could be
[0:29:50] <%relentingapunch> Love the idea of leveling up and gaining skills
[0:29:52] <%HollowedIdjit> BlazBlue used to have a ton of Single Player content
[0:30:43] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> It sound quiet for anyone else or just me?
[0:30:50] <%relentingapunch> Fine for me
[0:31:02] <cosmicgoatee> @canadiananimatorguy they're pretty good volume wise

[0:31:40] <kei_ar_> E's Laf is kinda learning off of other fighting games with the various mechanics per character and custom palletes
[0:31:41] <%Irridium> oh I'm sure he tried his best
[0:31:41] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> vineNut
[0:31:41] <savetitania> testing stalker sounds like a fucking experience
[0:31:48] <hassanico2> Yuji Naka made NiGHTS, AGAIN LUL
[0:31:54] <BlackermanZX> fucking PSO2 New Genesis tho
[0:31:59] <GenericSoda> get out of here stalker
[0:32:03] <cosmicgoatee> Scavengers, Trespassers, Adventurers, Loners, Killers, Explorers and Robbers
[0:32:05] <+OroOreo> Ek bok
[0:32:06] <+GreenCMD> I'm so mad the Tetris effect update is timed exclusive
[0:32:12] <irregularly_irregular> Nah I think it's pretty honest. You had a hard stance on that.
[0:32:14] <derap41> The Hardest doesn't ruin it but its not how its meant to be played
[0:32:19] <Drusain> Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix
[0:32:20] <savetitania> mgr revengeance
[0:32:20] <+bokutachi_san> Stalker's highest difficulty
[0:32:31] <Snakes_dk> Phantasy star was there, looked cool
[0:32:31] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1285426733492166656?s=20
[0:32:37] <irregularly_irregular> it ruins blind LPs is what you were saying.
[0:32:40] <%Javaa01> Stalker's hardest difficulty is the intended difficulty
[0:32:45] <+RyTYoung> yeyeyeye
[0:32:50] <penitentpentwitch> NO. Do NOT put Woolie through Legendary.
[0:32:52] <+Ryu_R> the game is built around heroic
[0:32:54] <+CptBritches> Woolie's done for
[0:32:55] <%relentingapunch> LASO is for people who lenjoy Halo
[0:32:55] <+Creggamonsta> super hard mode ant good for streams
[0:32:57] <BlackermanZX> doodWAT
[0:32:57] <%Javaa01> Everything under Master in Stalker actively makes the gameplay worse
[0:32:58] <+UberWolfman> Alatreon broke the MHW LUL
[0:32:59] <%Chatterbox1991> RONA
[0:33:02] <+Superbro64> rona monkaS
[0:33:02] <@Solidus_113> STALKER has fucked up difficulty settings, where easier makes both you and your enemies do less damage
[0:33:08] <skyheys> SHOOK at the thought of Legendary
[0:33:09] <%relentingapunch> Even just Legendary is rough in certain halo games
[0:33:12] <cosmicgoatee> you don't want pain and suffering understandable
[0:33:12] <DeepSearch27> Legendary is killing Woolie BEFORE touching him
[0:33:13] <%Exiliator> Sure it ruins LP's, but it makes for fun streaming
[0:33:18] <%NottaAlotta> ITS DA RONA
[0:33:19] <savetitania> @Solidus_113 so mgr but backwards??
[0:33:20] <penitentpentwitch> Heroic is a good balance of progress and difficulty
[0:33:22] <%relentingapunch> In Reach Legendary is ROUGH
[0:33:24] <cosmicgoatee> especially for an LP
[0:33:25] <%SomersaultJustice> unless you're max Kappa
[0:33:27] <FazzleRazzle> its not rona chat, hes not in America LUL
[0:33:28] <Apple_Tuna> In stalker hardest difficulty is easier in some aspects
[0:33:33] <Snakes_dk> true
[0:33:33] <%Irridium> Halo 2 legendary is fucked up man
[0:33:36] <shoryukenabotch> Thank you woolie
[0:33:39] <%Irridium> those fucking jackel snipers
[0:33:43] <irregularly_irregular> Yeah I don't think it's very fun to watch a streamer constantly eat shit in just a few shots <_<
[0:33:45] <%MacabreOpus> On an LP for sure start from Normal. Personally I always play on the hardest, because I'm a masochist
[0:33:47] <%FuqBoiSlim> Miss Rona paid woolie a visit 😢
[0:33:48] <%NottaAlotta> @fazzlerazzle LUL BibleThump
[0:33:58] <@Solidus_113> also in the case of SoC, make the RNG aim on your bullets absolute dogshit garbage
[0:34:03] <RichochetForce> Madame Rona
[0:34:03] <%relentingapunch> Woolie woolieVS COVID-19
[0:34:04] <%Javaa01> Halo's Legendary is not a well balanced difficulty
[0:34:08] <Bubba_Goldnine> Halo 2 legendary is pretty evil
[0:34:14] <%Kickin_Against_the_Switz> Skyrim with all of those brutal difficulty mods is fun as hell. but a completely different experience lol
[0:34:24] <cosmicgoatee> on your own time later it's worth the challenge, exactly it's not wise for a first time ever
[0:34:37] <%Kickin_Against_the_Switz> World at War on veteran is the only way to play Kappa
[0:34:37] <DeepSearch27> Legendary is flat out designed to be brag rights. Heroic is the correct way.
[0:34:39] <%masterpiecejeremy> Hardest difficulty ruins the experience in Last of Us
[0:34:45] <irregularly_irregular> I mean that makes sense. I started MGR on normal and built myself up to revengeance.
[0:34:53] <%MacabreOpus> That's why Dark Souls was a no-no for many streamers/LPers once they milked an hour long video for first-impressions. It was one and done for many
[0:34:54] <%chosenjuan42> first time playing you should play on intended difficulty
[0:34:55] <RichochetForce> @masterpiecejeremy It ruins most games
[0:34:56] <Prevot> people who do nuzlocke runs on their first time playing a pokemon game are crazy weirdos
[0:35:03] <jsocks654> fire emblem super like that
[0:35:08] <%relentingapunch> DT enemies are rough
[0:35:09] <Ashenik1> @Kickin_Against_the_Switz I always try the hardest first and Skyrim has a terrible one. Its just jarring ;d
[0:35:12] <%relentingapunch> On DMD n shit
[0:35:13] <%FuqBoiSlim> God Hand on hard is just a different game man
[0:35:16] <+Ryu_R> give me DEUS EX RarePepe
[0:35:16] <sahykikserpent> by the time kh3 came out proud mode was the only way for me to play it
[0:35:17] <RichochetForce> DT enemies, IMO, don't feel good
[0:35:19] <%lewdskeletor13> lewdskeletor13 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 6 month streak! Yo Woolie and Reggie, y’all are some of my favorite streamers/content creators. You both rock, keep on keeping on
[0:35:27] <penitentpentwitch> Activating Sunbro Mode!
[0:35:29] <RichochetForce> Certain enemies turn into dull damage sponges
[0:35:32] <cosmicgoatee> yeah basically DTs all day LUL
[0:35:33] <%jiggy_snipe> well
[0:35:43] <%jiggy_snipe> its easier and harder
[0:35:48] <+RyTYoung> Besides Sekiro
[0:35:52] <%saraizarai> leveling up is also droping dificulty in souls
[0:36:07] <derap41> Well he ain't getting any from the Princess so he had to go with the commons
[0:36:36] <irregularly_irregular> hey ASL is dope.
[0:36:42] <%masterpiecejeremy> Deluxe Honor
[0:36:44] <%SomersaultJustice> is reggie going to sign everything to appeal to wider audiences?
[0:36:55] <%jinking79> Sekiro just has the Bell Demon
[0:36:55] <%lewdskeletor13> Nice, that’s a very cool thing to learn Reggie
[0:36:56] <derap41> Was she the girl next door Woolie?
[0:37:00] <$BallerSwagBro9k> ALL ROADS LEAD TO GRENADA
[0:37:07] <+BeyondTheGrave07> Hey Woolie love your playthrough of Paper Mario. I just caught up on the YT playlist not sure if its current with where you are at in the live stream
[0:37:07] <%Mr_Ease> they should definitely teach Sign in schools instead of cursive writing
[0:37:11] <+RyTYoung> Just gotta shrink Woolie into the corner of every let's play so he can sign language LUL
[0:37:11] <%chosenjuan42> X gonna give it to ya. woolieOMG
[0:37:14] <@akuda_bar> the only deaf-oriented college in the world is here in this city, so if you go near there it's basically the Deaf Neighborhood
[0:37:17] <+Creggamonsta> what?
[0:37:20] <+RyTYoung> Reggie* I mean goddamit
[0:37:25] <%chosenjuan42> CROSS gonna give it to ya woolieGASM
[0:37:29] <%lewdskeletor13> @beyondthegrave07 Nah it’s a few streamed behind iirc
[0:37:34] <stachystat> Reggie to become the sign translator in the bottom of the screen
[0:37:36] <%KyoryUtchy> Blind hardest difficulty is funny for a one-off stream, but for full LP's it gets old fast.
[0:37:39] <cosmicgoatee> @mr_ease but how would I be able to make my J's look like Q's?
[0:37:40] <%relentingapunch> Chi gon' give it to ya

[0:38:04] <%ozmon> Woo, DFO

[0:38:46] <+Juriasu> katanagatari in a nutshell
[0:38:47] <$BallerSwagBro9k> PUNCH HEROES ARE THE BEST
[0:39:02] <%SomersaultJustice> You can't always trust a sword. Only trust your fists.
[0:39:05] <%relentingapunch> Idea: character action game revolving around a punch hero
[0:39:06] <%HollowedIdjit> @WoolieVersus yeah more or less the same here, that's what draws me to Unarmed Charaters in weapon fighters. Or just The Normal Guy when everyone else is using magic.
[0:39:07] <+desfore> heihachi in SC2
[0:39:08] <%chosenjuan42> Remember in resident evil when Mr CROSS chases you down? woolieSMUG

[0:41:09] <RichochetForce> They repeated HALO over 300 times
[0:41:12] <%HollowedIdjit> @WoolieVersus thanks for the answer, I'm glad to hear that our reasons are more or less the same. Always take Normal Guy over a Magic Guy.
[0:41:12] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> no CAR
[0:41:13] <DragonArt07> it ended as you started
[0:41:13] <%Exiliator> There was no stage, it was just trailers LUL
[0:41:21] <TallPixels> More than 50% pre-rendered trailers
[0:41:24] <cosmicgoatee> Balan Wonderland is nice for not being Nights
[0:41:28] <%lewdskeletor13> It was just a bunch of trailers actually
[0:41:29] <%Javaa01> Tetris Effect multiplayer update by the end of the year
[0:41:30] <RichochetForce> Yeah, 70% was CG trailers
[0:41:33] <%relentingapunch> I heard everything I would've wanted to ehar abt on twitter
[0:41:35] <%relentingapunch> tbh
[0:41:35] <%mechslayer71> It was just trailers, and there was no TV. Wasn’t good though
[0:41:37] <%MacabreOpus> Halo is Sekiro with aliens now, v cool
[0:41:48] <+r_Foeburden87> You didn't miss much, i wouldn't stress
[0:41:49] <StarMechV> Balan Wonderworld is a spiritual successor in asthetic only. It's more of a platformer than a flight simulator
[0:41:49] <Davybot> whats the thoughts on BRC
[0:42:00] <RichochetForce> Keep on Keeping on is amazing.
[0:42:08] <%chosenjuan42> you can't escape from Xing fate

[0:42:15] <Bustahhwulf> isnt that a common saying kek
[0:42:18] <TallPixels> Balan Wonderworld looked like a Mario 3D world game tbh
[0:42:19] <%lewdskeletor13> I say it a lot now
[0:42:22] <+scifimisc> Isnt that a song?
[0:42:25] <irregularly_irregular> It's a good phrase to say to oneself as one travels across mountains carrying cases of sperms and eggs.

[1:11:13] <%i_heart_gaming> wait does he have to go to the door?
[1:11:13] <DeepSearch27> Does Mario get off the boat?
[1:11:14] <@akuda_bar> oy fprdm
[1:11:16] <+Wilabeen1997> Nothing
[1:11:17] <GenericSoda> @jonny_uppercut no worries my dude micspammed that song in tf2 back in the day
[1:11:17] <+regis_j_rock> @CappuccinoGuil although rail, there's still fire enemies
[1:11:21] <%sunnythedrunk> He went to the door
[1:11:22] <velgaduere> @CappuccinoGuil nothing. you can use partners to hit ceiling enemies
[1:11:23] <+regis_j_rock> *rare not rail
[1:11:24] <@akuda_bar> *blowing the boat does nothing.
[1:11:24] <+runningfleet> they went to the door
[1:11:26] <%Papa_Bearman> @CappuccinoGuil What if you fight an enemy that takes your Jump away?
[1:11:27] <theCoolChild> Here's how the story goes we find out

[1:11:39] <+IceyCone> hammer is more damage at once as opposed to jumping which is multiple hits
[1:11:42] <JetpackMcQuack> So this is the game now I see
[1:11:44] <BreakersAweigh> goblins activated

[3:26:03] <hassanico2> Ok so FLurry is half Lakitu LUL
[3:26:04] <Louie_Salmon> Vivian is much closer to a boo, with the invisiblity

[3:44:47] <ScandalousSam262> iirc Mowz can heal Mario but you can just have any other partner use an item that can heal him for more
[3:44:55] <%Proxzo> sweet treet might be good

[3:59:28] <%kyh9> Why would you want to keep Flavio with you?

[4:02:16] <@akuda_bar> @WoolieVersus nice shirt
[4:02:20] <%ozmon> When it's not in western culture to make anime that caters to a more young adult demographic, they make Totally Spies

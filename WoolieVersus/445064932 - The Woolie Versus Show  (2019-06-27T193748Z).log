[0:43:27] <damienlunas> I just got here, has anyone had to yell 4/4 time at woolie yet
[0:43:48] <joylent_blue> woolie has been the one yelling if anything
[0:43:58] <@Menitta> This game is great because it has something from every Zelda style
[0:44:05] <Dalkalopagus> The map layout is randomly generated with every playthrough
[0:44:05] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[0:44:05] <ScareCrow100> So Zelda but with a rythm game mechanic
[0:44:08] <+Ace5335> the map is generated
[0:44:09] <sir_nack> woolie's a normal human being that can hear music, so he's fine
[0:44:09] <ActualNobody6400> Oh dip, it's multiplayer?!
[0:44:10] <+NerevaRising> I think the map is procedurally generated
[0:44:12] <+Gooniekorn> banger alert
[0:44:13] <sileo_patronus> The map layout is actually randomised by playthrough
[0:44:14] <Prevot> need time stop
[0:44:18] <+GrislyBoar> It's rogue-lite. Dungeons are randomized and the overworld is generated on each new file.
[0:44:39] <TheRickyWill> its a bit of both because the entire overworld, aside from setpieces, are entirely random
[0:45:21] <sir_nack> god this cave theme is SO GOOD
[0:45:33] <Enyoyable> Need G U N
[0:45:45] <%This_is_Marco> just once
[0:46:00] <ihateyouo> most of the map is random gen
[0:46:25] <$eco419> B)
[0:46:35] <Mirakei> i imagine it randomizes once you make/start your new save file but things stay in place after that untill you create a new game/save file again

[0:51:47] <TopLeftCenter> @WoolieVersus the sync test in this game is kinda weird, it wants you to react during the test instead of hitting the beat

[1:18:33] <@Menitta> This is why the spear is the best
[1:18:39] <SomersaultJustice> it's already failed again
[1:18:45] <sileo_patronus> standing still only keeps the beat when you enter the room
[1:18:46] <+ALTRNico> now ruin it
[1:19:01] <%Wool> you guys missed the beat
[1:19:02] <+skizzuto> you guys missed a beat
[1:19:04] <jbrooksdev> THEY MISSED THE BEAT FIRST GUY
[1:19:07] <SomersaultJustice> you can tell if it's failed if the eyes stop flashing
[1:19:13] <WllmBrandt> When the light in the eyes of the chest go out, you failed
[1:19:17] <Tisaric> The eyes tell if it's enabled
[1:19:17] <velgaduere> at least the Deku Scrub is gone now
[1:19:20] <%Wool> hey it's easier now without the deku scrub
[1:19:27] <%Wool> NOPE
[1:19:31] <velgaduere> you DO miss the beat if you stand still
[1:19:33] <GKannel> standing still missed beat
[1:19:34] <+Ascethetic> you missed the beat
[1:19:37] <axelcezar> zelda is so fucking adorable here
[1:19:39] <$SilverRoddo> “You’re suppose the listen to the notes she’s not playing.”
[1:19:41] <velgaduere> you MUST perform an action to not miss the beat
[1:19:43] <%Wool> HAHAHA
[1:19:45] <+skizzuto> you miss a beat if you stand still for too long
[1:19:47] <TheWe4pon> ONce you start moving you cant stop
[1:19:48] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:19:50] <+Aztec50> you cant stand still
[1:19:53] <sir_nack> @WoolieVersus you miss a beat if you stand still, standing still is only okay when you enter the room
[1:19:57] <+Aztec50> or not nvm
[1:20:09] <Tisaric> co-op probably changes that rules
[1:20:12] <sileo_patronus> standing still only keeps the beat when you enter the room
[1:20:13] <+allups> so is it screen by screen rogue like?
[1:20:13] <TheRickyWill> “just drive the van Reggie”
[1:20:14] <SomersaultJustice> you can't stop moving after you start
[1:20:15] <mojokingizakku> maybe it's needing to move with the beat
[1:20:38] <@Menitta> Co-op makes this way harder lol
[1:20:48] <%Wool> how long are they going to be stuck on this one screen
[1:20:54] <Tisaric> yeah co op is making this way harder than it usually is
[1:20:55] <+TheImmortal70> SHIELDING is fine
[1:20:58] <+TheImmortal70> But not standing still
[1:20:59] <velgaduere> shielding is an action. not performing an action loses the beat
[1:20:59] <+BlueCenter77> shield is not standing still
[1:20:59] <sileo_patronus> Shielding is not standing still
[1:21:12] <TheRickyWill> shielding is not standinf
[1:21:17] <+ALTRNico> Is someone keeping count on how many tries?
[1:21:18] <$SilverRoddo> Contra could benefit from this.
[1:21:30] <%Wool> is this the Baba of screens?

[1:26:33] <wirblewomble> are you allowed to stand in place and keep attacking?
[1:26:52] <wirblewomble> or is attack by bump

[1:32:40] <+SvenHolgersson> But what if your opponent has no dignity
[1:32:44] <Lady_M91> I'm taking mental damage from this conversation.
[1:32:46] <goose_attack_almanac> Brainfreeze is a mild inconvenience. Poopin' at will can dehydrate
[1:32:50] <%ironohki> I'm there.
[1:32:52] <%ironohki> I know that feel.
[1:32:57] <%ironohki> That is the struggle.
[1:33:04] <ErroneousNickname> aaaaaaah thats me
[1:33:09] <$SilverRoddo> If you can deal with shit, I’ll take the poop-pants, because it becomes an effect power against your enemies at that point.
[1:33:09] <reonome> tfw haven't drawn in weeks
[1:33:15] <@Menitta> Man, I'm in college now and it sucks
[1:33:26] <+DrPoxx> How is that even a matchup? Shitting yourself is way more involved and destructive than an intense headache
[1:33:26] <%ironohki> I'm working on a graphic novel and I'm at about 1 page every 3 weeks.
[1:33:28] <%ironohki> It's pain.
[1:33:30] <FenixSeraph> have a lot of ideas and the last thing I drew was lewds
[1:33:39] <FenixSeraph> instead of all the actually cool shit I wanted to
[1:33:58] <%ironohki> ADULTHOOD IS BULLSHIT.
[1:33:59] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[1:34:38] <%ironohki> @alttab I have a group of friends I draw with once a week. That's been vital for me. We hit a bar every tuesday and drink-and-draw.
[1:34:41] <masterfire23> I have over 1300hrs on genji LUL
[1:34:44] <%ironohki> That's the only reason I haven't quit.

[1:57:13] <axelcezar> this game is basically symphony of the night + arya of sorrow
[1:57:17] <%UrsulaCat> reggie sounds weird in this stream
[1:57:18] <%yeknomlive> on the ahead.
[1:57:25] <+Risingxiv> pretty much
[1:57:26] <+TechnicolorNinja> The Blank Ahead
[1:57:29] <worldbrand> ritual of the night is like a fairly good igavania, but curse of the moon is a fantastic classicvania. probably the best
[1:57:29] <NickHatesSnow> Aria is the best one
[1:57:41] <QaizerArt> yeah okay Johannes, go ahead and try to kill the mega demon guy
[1:57:45] <SelfMaidMan> dawn tho
[1:57:51] <MarylandJutsu> Aria of Sorrow is amazing its true

[2:04:11] <worldbrand> the second slot's for ammo don't worry about it
[2:04:14] <+allups> look at them legs god damn

[2:04:58] <mojokingizakku> he'll find the note
[2:05:00] <Goraka91> So the aesthetic i'm getting out of this is (Blood) stained windows?
[2:05:09] <SixthSun2> Equip a weapon @WoolieVersus
[2:05:09] <Buzzard42> tbh Curse of the Moon is better than the full game
[2:05:12] <axelcezar> curse of the moon is like a prequel in retro game style with multiple characters and endings 40% off now on steam
[2:05:14] <@akuda_bar> stupid sexy zubaz
[2:05:14] <RiceeFTW> the aesthetic is NOT castlevania
[2:05:29] <SomersaultJustice> it was going to be the prequel, but then they made it non canon
[2:05:35] <$FuqBoiSlim> Yikes, Ninty....
[2:05:36] <+REDtheBEAST> I 100% this game a few days ago, im hoping that you enjoy this game @WoolieVersus SeemsGood
[2:05:41] <worldbrand> @Buzzard42 for what it was trying to be, i gotta agree... seeing those bosses again was a comparative letdown
[2:05:43] <Buzzard42> yeah the Switch version is really bad, I'm super mad about it
[2:06:07] <YellowDays> whats wrong with the switch version
[2:06:08] <+legitimatejohnathan> THE STORM IS HERE ⚡ sbfpBaz ⚡
[2:06:23] <+Bananaking744> is woolies mic off?
[2:06:24] <Goraka91> The Switch version of EVERYTHING is really bad FeelsBadMan
[2:06:25] <axelcezar> the switch port is straight up broken
[2:06:30] <$FuqBoiSlim> Input lag ResidentSleeper
[2:06:32] <SixthSun2> Equip a weapon NotLikeThis
[2:06:33] <POOPSinBED> Every console version of this game I have played has some technical problems.
[2:06:35] <IndoorSitup> Not "try", they WILL fix it.
[2:06:44] <%yeknomlive> @SixthSun2 he has the kunfu shoes on
[2:06:46] <IndoorSitup> @sixthsun2 already done
[2:06:49] <$FuqBoiSlim> @sixthsun2 He has the kung fu shoes on
[2:06:50] <%UrsulaCat> FEET
[2:06:53] <worldbrand> I think the specular layer looks kinda...
[2:06:56] <Buzzard42> To be fair to the Switch
[2:07:04] <axelcezar> "bad"
[2:07:05] <Prevot> switch version runs as bad as it looks
[2:07:06] <Buzzard42> it isn't an issue with the console, the port is just REALLY bad
[2:07:08] <%Promessa_EX> theres no way I would play this game at 30fps with lag
[2:07:08] <%UrsulaCat> de-equip shoes and shoe feet
[2:07:14] <%UrsulaCat> show feet I mean
[2:07:19] <+allups> worst graphics is what he means i think
[2:07:26] <RiceeFTW> tell Woolie to do fireball with the shoes
[2:07:31] <xdeathknightx> Minh proudly taking Pat's place as purveyor of controversial opinions Kappa
[2:07:31] <SomersaultJustice> did they try the rekka yet?
[2:07:37] <+Nobrev> 3d can look good too
[2:07:37] <$FuqBoiSlim> Fuck Ninty and Fuck the Shitch EleGiggle
[2:07:39] <RiceeFTW> no
[2:07:39] <Buzzard42> I don't think the Rekka is immediately available
[2:07:39] <Valentinius_Anodyne> They do some neat stuff with the 3D at least
[2:07:42] <RiceeFTW> yes it is
[2:07:48] <Buzzard42> OH
[2:07:50] <worldbrand> yeehaw
[2:07:50] <RiceeFTW> out of mana
[2:07:52] <%yeknomlive> uses mp
[2:07:53] <Buzzard42> costs mana though
[2:07:53] <fireking900> Reggie def wants the kicks
[2:07:56] <+BlueCenter77> rekka in the extend jump
[2:07:57] <+froduck42> Tish that's french!
[2:07:59] <SomersaultJustice> HOLD UP and do nothing
[2:08:01] <sir_nack> yeah, if it wasn't 3D they wouldn't have been able to do all the different customization stuff, it would have been more limited in that area
[2:08:04] <reonome> Kreygasm
[2:08:04] <TheWe4pon> @WoolieVersus some walls hide Hp/Mp ups
[2:08:06] <axelcezar> every cathegory of weapon also has some technic thingy
[2:08:09] <%Promessa_EX> pc is a winner for bloodstained. 144hz and all. less bugs
[2:08:17] <QaizerArt> Hold UP without doing anything!
[2:08:18] <Buzzard42> @WoolieVersus Hold Up for a while
[2:08:20] <mayorrev> God she's so adorable BibleThump

[2:08:35] <Buzzard42> DIO
[2:08:36] <%yeknomlive> you aint seeen nothing yet
[2:08:37] <KessOrangeSoda> there's a FEW JJBA references in this game
[2:08:37] <$FuqBoiSlim> WAS THAT A-?!?!?!
[2:08:39] <Laicuss> thats just some fucking jojo shit right there
[2:08:39] <reonome> KONO DIO DA
[2:08:42] <+HyperCharge_Sam> this game just rips off Jojo, it's ridiculous
[2:08:45] <+SirPotsNPans> [MENACING]
[2:08:46] <POOPSinBED> It’s “acceptable” as far as its looks go. I wish it was still sprites, sotn still looks good
[2:08:47] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @Buzzard42
[2:08:48] <IndoorSitup> IS THAT A JOJO REFERENCE?!?!?!?!
[2:08:50] <Prevot> IS THAT A-

[2:09:04] <+froduck42> Joesph was the other character earlier

[2:09:20] <rosemon5001> casting couch
[2:09:28] <Buzzard42> the Switch port also has abysmal load times
[2:09:32] <Buzzard42> it's overall a really poorly done port
[2:09:33] <RiceeFTW> not spamming walls for wall chickens hggSleep
[2:09:41] <Buzzard42> like, it's clearly rushed
[2:09:43] <axelcezar> you soon willget a shitload of MP and MP max ups so chill
[2:09:50] <+skylerpilot> @WoolieVersus you can use it in the air for extra distance on jumps
[2:09:51] <+BlueCenter77> use rekkas in the air to extend jump length
[2:10:00] <KessOrangeSoda> you could use the three kicks to effectively extend your jumps
[2:10:01] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Mana's hard to come by at first, but it's worth it then
[2:10:05] <sir_nack> there's a shit ton of breakable walls
[2:10:11] <startstoprepeat> there are kickable walls, roofs and floors
[2:10:13] <+SirPotsNPans> If you keep using the kicks, you can master the technique and use it with ANY other foot weapon
[2:10:15] <worldbrand> Hahaha... if only there was a breakable wall nearby.... ahaha...
[2:10:16] <+bigb00gi3> in the bottom right of that big room you were just in @WoolieVersus
[2:10:18] <%yeknomlive> the switch port was way later in the ks campaign though.
[2:10:21] <+SirPotsNPans> Otherwise only that one can do it
[2:10:23] <$FuqBoiSlim> AUUAHAUAAAH
[2:10:25] <GoldeNOVA> Castlevania also has fake ceiling and floors, so kick EVERYTHING
[2:10:27] <%Promessa_EX> you'll know when there's a wall
[2:10:28] <mayorrev> BAZ
[2:10:31] <13sin> If he wants to see a breakable wall then there is one he has passed already
[2:10:33] <RiceeFTW> already missed 3 hggSleep
[2:10:34] <Buzzard42> in the state the Switch port is in
[2:10:39] <sir_nack> @WoolieVersus there's fake walls, but also fakes floors and ceilings. enjoy!
[2:10:39] <SomersaultJustice> there's also fake ceilings and floors
[2:10:42] <Buzzard42> it isn't actually going to be out for like 3 months
[2:10:46] <Buzzard42> we got an Early Access dev build
[2:10:50] <MarylandJutsu> the STAHTE OUF EET
[2:10:50] <axelcezar> tons and tons of secrets
[2:10:51] <wirblewomble> well that'a
[2:11:02] <wirblewomble> that's what messages are for in souls
[2:11:13] <BestTeaMaker> did woolie not even read that
[2:11:14] <RiceeFTW> woolie missed the tutorial hggOkay
[2:11:15] <$FuqBoiSlim> uhhhh
[2:11:16] <BestTeaMaker> LUL
[2:11:17] <axelcezar> instructions literally on the screen boupheBrad boupheBrad
[2:11:22] <Laironx3> Aria of Sorrow had a soul ability that helped you find breakable walls.
[2:11:23] <Goraka91> FailFish
[2:11:23] <joylent_blue> tutorial being missed NotLikeThis
[2:11:25] <Prevot> of course Minh would like that
[2:11:27] <+allups> lego starwars games made me break everything
[2:11:29] <+BlueCenter77> wall
[2:11:29] <Buzzard42> wall on the right
[2:11:35] <RiceeFTW> LMFAOOOO
[2:11:37] <$FuqBoiSlim> Chat why would woolie do this
[2:11:40] <the_Deadpan_Man> you missed the tutorial
[2:11:45] <+allups> game bad now
[2:11:47] <+primax104> woolie's game is ruined XD
[2:11:50] <IndoorSitup> YO WOOLIE PAY ATTENTION
[2:11:51] <axelcezar> blinder than Paige
[2:11:53] <Goraka91> So does Woolie know how to use his new ability?
[2:11:59] <sir_nack> i dont think he does
[2:12:05] <+ninebreaker6> no he doesnt
[2:12:05] <mojokingizakku> he will figure it out
[2:12:08] <POOPSinBED> @buzzard42 The Xbox version still doesn’t have the day one patch yet. You can’t craft some endgame items because the item drop isn’t even in the game yet.
[2:12:16] <%Promessa_EX> there are plenty of abilities that show the walls
[2:12:16] <Buzzard42> what a joke LMAO
[2:12:20] <+allups> i get where he's coming from
[2:12:22] <%yeknomlive> dont tell him about the floor and ceiling ones
[2:12:27] <rosemon5001> back peddleing soo hard
[2:12:28] <worldbrand> I think about hitting them a lot, but I think it's because i grew up with castlevania
[2:12:29] <Prevot> it's a pretty bad gameplay mechanic
[2:12:38] <+primax104> breakable walls are a staple in 2d style games though
[2:12:43] <SomersaultJustice> so is the pc version the least borked version?
[2:12:49] <IndoorSitup> REGGIE TO THE RESCUE
[2:12:50] <%yeknomlive> yeah
[2:12:54] <SixthSun2> LUL that enemy
[2:12:54] <mojokingizakku> pc version worked
[2:13:05] <Valentinius_Anodyne> PC version worked great
[2:13:11] <Goraka91> Know nothing about this game, was PC the first version?
[2:13:15] <%yeknomlive> @SomersaultJustice aside from my ps4 save getting corrupted it doesnt load as quickly. i dont have to worry about crashes on pc copy
[2:13:19] <+primax104> has woolie names the woolie vs conglomerate yet?
[2:13:25] <+primax104> *named
[2:13:25] <RiceeFTW> what's worse: breakable walls in Metroidvania games or those invisible walls in Dark Souls with a hidden bonfire?
[2:13:40] <ShinobiPhoenix> Castlevania 3, not 2
[2:13:40] <GoldeNOVA> The bonfire wall
[2:13:45] <GoldeNOVA> Castlevania has maps with percentages
[2:13:48] <+allups> @Goraka91 nah thy all released on the same time i think
[2:13:53] <GoldeNOVA> All you gotta do is search the area
[2:13:53] <Goraka91> AH
[2:13:56] <rosemon5001> will woolie ever find the tutorial find out next time
[2:13:59] <wirblewomble> That's not remotely a bad mechanic, it's an optional thing for people who want to put a little more time into exploration. As long as they're telegraphed well, which they usually are.
[2:13:59] <worldbrand> I dont mind either, to be honest, but i never found that wall bonfire next to artoria's crest on my own
[2:14:00] <%yeknomlive> all the breakable walls in this game are just bonuses not progression
[2:14:26] <Parapattern> I've always thought that the movement systems in Castlevania games feel way too stiff. That's just me, though.
[2:14:29] <IndoorSitup> @woolieversus Yo, your guys' audio is a little bit quiet.
[2:14:32] <RiceeFTW> when green barrels are the ones that explode hggBruh
[2:14:39] <Laironx3> Red means passion CurseLit
[2:14:50] <Prevot> LUL
[2:15:01] <wirblewomble> @parapattern that's only the nes games, the rest control pretty fluidly.
[2:15:01] <Goraka91> But does the crate explode?
[2:15:04] <+allups> LUL yeah it blows up and u fall in lust
[2:15:15] <IndoorSitup> @woolieversus Game audio is a little too loud.
[2:15:22] <GoldeNOVA> You heard it here first, TES games are garbage
[2:15:25] <Goraka91> Wait what LUL
[2:15:31] <worldbrand> I won't contest that
[2:15:40] <RiceeFTW> Miss Harvey is a CS player
[2:15:51] <HorribleHog> arena and daggerfall are good.
[2:16:09] <axelcezar> please @WoolieVersus give it a try to the japanese audio
[2:16:19] <+allups> skyrims world was good but boss fights sucked
[2:16:19] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:16:21] <IndoorSitup> Man, Woolie is SO not paying attention.

[2:16:35] <IndoorSitup> Didn't even notice he got a short saord.
[2:16:37] <@Menitta> Rip Half life
[2:16:40] <IndoorSitup> *sword
[2:16:43] <wirblewomble> so crates don't make sense on a boat?
[2:16:54] <Goraka91> Hard to talk and play at the same time, Let's Players curse
[2:16:55] <Parapattern> @WoolieVersus What else would be on a ship besides crates, chests, and barrels?
[2:17:09] <TheWe4pon> people?
[2:17:10] <HorribleHog> morrowind and oblivion magic is superior to skyrim, oblivion has probably the best combat out of the new three
[2:17:14] <RiceeFTW> lots and lots of rum
[2:17:22] <IndoorSitup> So I guess chat is being completely ignored today.

[2:52:14] <dan_g_v> does eyepatch wolf count as english?
[2:52:14] <%yeknomlive> it hits full screen too
[2:52:15] <Youwereeatenbyalid> yooo
[2:52:19] <+EndgameContent> THAT'S A CRUNCHY HITSTOP
[2:52:28] <SomersaultJustice> baited
[2:52:31] <Prevot> fucking medusa head
[2:52:36] <+yoshkosh20> ok. kick minh out for that.
[2:52:38] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Hitstops that stop time are the best
[2:52:41] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I love the katanas in this game, they're a lot of fun to use
[2:52:49] <13sin> @WoolieVersus Attack with the katana and then dont move and dont attack again for a moment and she will pose.
[2:52:55] <Laironx3> Parry that bird
[2:52:55] <sileo_patronus> Free combo
[2:53:07] <TigerClaws12> has woolie learned the korean dash?
[2:53:09] <SomersaultJustice> try forward back forward and 360s
[2:53:12] <+allups> o she has no feet
[2:53:16] <mrgrimsmiles> around the world motion ?
[2:53:20] <sileo_patronus> Half-back then forward?
[2:53:23] <ShinobiPhoenix> @woolieversus Quarter circle forward + Atk
[2:53:25] <%yeknomlive> 360
[2:53:27] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Do you reckon Devolver could make a smash game? I feel like they have enough shit to make one at this point.
[2:53:30] <RiceeFTW> 360 with spear
[2:53:36] <RiceeFTW> down+full circle
[2:53:49] <dan_g_v> dont you need. magic?
[2:53:57] <ShinobiPhoenix> Hadoken motion with Katana
[2:53:58] <Iamjustabox> Not every spear has every spear technique (until you master a tech by landing it enough, then every spear gets it)
[2:54:01] <+Proxzo> Hi Woolie!
[2:54:02] <Iamjustabox> Same with other weapon types
[2:54:12] <+Proxzo> gooey boy
[2:54:19] <+allups> i think woolie knows how to do a 360
[2:54:21] <%yeknomlive> this spear does have it though
[2:54:23] <custoadian> I think a lance is the first spear weapon with a tech
[2:54:24] <TigerClaws12> base spear has no technique
[2:54:27] <ShinobiPhoenix> It's not a full circle
[2:54:32] <+Swisstoast> if you master them then they do
[2:54:44] <Cowctus> every weapon of it's class will have the technique when said technique is mastered
[2:54:50] <axelcezar> find the bookshelves and they tel you about techniques
[2:55:00] <+Stereotreme> katanas are super satisfying once you've mastered everything
[2:55:01] <+Fynale> has anyone told him about pressing down on the d pad while standing still
[2:55:02] <reonome> ROYAL GUARD
[2:55:03] <ShinobiPhoenix> It down to forward clockwise
[2:55:08] <+Stereotreme> they have so much utility
[2:55:12] <sileo_patronus> @WoolieVersus your Royal Guard is showing
[2:55:22] <%yeknomlive> @WoolieVersus you can read journals that will tell you moves to what weapons that gets recorded so you can check later
[2:55:24] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Parry makes the next boss pretty easy in my experience
[2:55:34] <ShinobiPhoenix> You can't parry projectiles
[2:55:34] <Iamjustabox> Do you mean pressing up? Pressing down just crouches, holding up is Fabulous
[2:55:34] <mrgrimsmiles> @WoolieVersus they show move list you test in the menu in the data area
[2:55:43] <+Fynale> there is a jojo pose you can do
[2:55:47] <MaximumSleep> you can pose while holding up if you're standing, but not sitting
[2:55:56] <%yeknomlive> there's a journal in this room
[2:55:58] <RiceeFTW> he did the dio pose
[2:55:59] <ShinobiPhoenix> @woolieversus you can't parry projectiles
[2:56:03] <axelcezar> enter the castle!
[2:56:07] <bustawof> Pat already told woolie about the poses
[2:56:13] <axelcezar> that was all tutorial by now
[2:56:15] <Sonicdy> by holding up is taunt

[3:00:16] <presque> The dynamic of this trio is all over the place
[3:00:44] <RiceeFTW> Iga created a classic, Bloodstained is just a rehash of the classic
[3:00:50] <ShinobiPhoenix> There are better games that are also metros
[3:00:51] <RiceeFTW> which I don't mind
[3:01:04] <GoldeNOVA> Kojima created the stealth game, but he's not the best stealth game creator, not even close

[0:07:48] <%PadreHail> Can't believe they made a game about these SaltyBet characters
[0:07:55] <simp_solth> Hello everyone
[0:08:03] <%DesertPenguin> Oh yea Thursday is fighting games
[0:08:15] <knackirontarkus> dlanor’s fuckin raw
[0:08:16] <%Baxterj7> Is there a Discord for this community?
[0:08:16] <alephalpha> @DesertPenguin fighting game based on murder myster met romance crazy masterpicee visual novel thing
[0:08:27] <%PadreHail> Umineko is fuckin weird
[0:08:36] <KalmVibrations> There's a discord, yeah
[0:08:36] <+SleepingPliskin> well yes but small
[0:08:41] <%PadreHail> Especially for how it ties into Higurashi
[0:08:47] <%Livelinne> grannDisco grannDisco grannDisco
[0:08:49] <alephalpha> the community is small but there are some real killers
[0:08:52] <+SleepingPliskin> it's part of the larger 07th expansion stuff
[0:08:57] <alephalpha> who probably won't be on today
[0:08:59] <+0rangeBoyZ> I'm gonna say that if Umineko even remotely interests you then I suggest you don't watch
[0:09:02] <+SleepingPliskin> so like higurashi
[0:09:03] <+Byronic_dreamer> !discord
[0:09:10] <alephalpha> the anime for umineko is really garbahe
[0:09:16] <+SleepingPliskin> yeah it is
[0:09:22] <%PadreHail> Yeah this game has some spoils
[0:09:22] <devanmuse> @DesertPenguin Umineko is visual novel. It starts as a fairly straightforward murder mystery, but gets high concept VERY QUICKLY.
[0:09:23] <+0rangeBoyZ> Manga/VN are the way to go
[0:09:23] <+SleepingPliskin> the visual novel is on discord
[0:09:25] <alephalpha> mangvn is the right choice but uf you can't maga eis good too
[0:09:26] <CyberEne> um OH DESIRE
[0:09:33] <knackirontarkus> the umi anime is real bad
[0:09:35] <CookieDoughFK> rolling star always get me emotional
[0:09:47] <+0rangeBoyZ> Join the CSB discord so I can tell you to read Umineko
[0:09:51] <alephalpha> ^
[0:09:56] <%Livelinne> Umineko is really hard to explain cuz every detail can be SHPOILERS shiaUGH
[0:09:57] <%PadreHail> Umineko is definitely one of those things that works best as a manga or visual novel unless a good studio gets it
[0:09:58] <%Baxterj7> Lol bet
[0:10:05] <%DesertPenguin> The CSB discord is insanely hard to keep up with
[0:10:07] <%DesertPenguin> I had to back out
[0:10:09] <+Byronic_dreamer> !discord
[0:10:11] <+SleepingPliskin> it's honestly like the best insane mystery novel that isn't really a mystery novel ever
[0:10:18] <+Byronic_dreamer> is there not a discord link?
[0:10:19] <%PadreHail> Cuz the Umineko anime is like, original Fate Stay Night anime quality
[0:10:27] <KalmVibrations> It's arguably worse
[0:10:29] <alephalpha> @Livelinne like duiring a reread every other line hits you like a truck
[0:10:31] <+SleepingPliskin> like golden age detective fiction ain't got shit on umineko
[0:10:32] <+0rangeBoyZ> It's also half finished
[0:10:35] <%DesertPenguin> Maybe !discord works on the CSB channel
[0:10:36] <+Byronic_dreamer> or is it CSB discord?
[0:10:38] <+0rangeBoyZ> And will never be finished
[0:10:42] <alephalpha> it's not even half finished
[0:10:51] <+SleepingPliskin> padre thats an insult to deen stay night
[0:10:52] <%Livelinne> All I can say is the character development and dynamics are godlike woolieGASM
[0:10:53] <spidervenomized> what this ost?
[0:10:56] <alephalpha> because the portion it did adapt is yeha
[0:11:06] <@Solidus_113> the only link to the CSB discord is on the 2BFP subreddit Sidebar
[0:11:14] <%PadreHail> JSRF I think
[0:11:15] <alephalpha> ryukishi sure knows how to write characters
[0:11:19] <%Livelinne> Oh yeah and it also shreds your soul
[0:11:22] <+Byronic_dreamer> @solidus_113 thank you!
[0:11:25] <alephalpha> his expereinecs as a social worker also really shien through
[0:11:40] <+SleepingPliskin> tbh I think setting wise, woolie would enjoy Rose Guns Days more
[0:11:44] <@Solidus_113> This song is from a mobile game Naganuma was hired on for
[0:11:45] <alephalpha> well yeah
[0:11:48] <+SleepingPliskin> unfortunately no official release
[0:11:53] <%Josef_Stryker> I wonder when if/when we'll get a "Get Out of Fighting Games"
[0:12:00] <+captain_history> Higurashi is getting a new anime soon
[0:12:01] <+0rangeBoyZ> I think Umineko could still be up his Ally
[0:12:05] <+0rangeBoyZ> Maybe not Higurashi though
[0:12:07] <devanmuse> @alephalpha Ryukishi used to be a social worker? That explains Satoko's whole subplot in Higurashi...
[0:12:12] <%Livelinne> @alephalpha Hoo boi it is shiaFeels
[0:12:12] <alephalpha> yeah
[0:12:17] <+0rangeBoyZ> Also rosa/Maria
[0:12:20] <alephalpha> yup
[0:12:24] <+SleepingPliskin> yeah he used to be a social worker
[0:12:25] <Man_in_the_Red> they'll do an Get Out episode when they play Breakers revenge
[0:12:52] <+SleepingPliskin> María bulli is probably more fucked up than people realize considering how normalized it's written
[0:12:55] <knackirontarkus> for those who have read Ciconia phase 1, how good is it?
[0:12:57] <alephalpha> honeslty most 07th expansions tuff is good enough that woolei would liek it the issue is getting him interested
[0:13:05] <alephalpha> and if he's not no ppoint in badgering him
[0:13:14] <%PadreHail> Woolie should peep Vanguard Princess on one of these streams
[0:13:15] <+SleepingPliskin> only because she's a clumsy child that no one likes which is sad
[0:13:16] <+0rangeBoyZ> @knackirontarkus It's a little all over the place in quality but the ending pops off SUPER FUCKING HARD
[0:13:16] <%Livelinne> I’m here for fangirl over Rudolf don’t mind me woolieMIRIN
[0:13:19] <alephalpha> CICONIA IS GODLIKE
[0:13:20] <rmwolfe> umineko is like the most anti-woolie story ever, thematically
[0:13:29] <%Baxterj7> I can’t find a CSB discord link anywhere lame =\ maybe on the reddit?
[0:13:32] <alephalpha> no ide ahow it will go but it might become my fvaoruite wtc
[0:13:33] <%ScreamLord> It's funny how Fem-Woolie is almost always drawn with a 6-pack when I'm pretty sure Woolie has never had one in his life
[0:13:36] <+SleepingPliskin> Wolfe why so
[0:13:41] <knackirontarkus> good shit, I need to read it real soon
[0:13:41] <+0rangeBoyZ> Apocalypse Ciconia 2 is a goated song
[0:13:42] <+captain_history> it's funny how hard is to explain people that Higurashi is one of the most wholesome stories one can read
[0:13:50] <devanmuse> @knackirontarkus I enjoyed Ciconia phase 1, but it's very different compared to Umi, or even Higu. It's hard to really judge it based on only one chapter (the one that's supposed to confuse you the most)
[0:13:58] <+0rangeBoyZ> Hey by the way
[0:13:59] <%PadreHail> I actually wish Vanguard Princess got some more work on it into a bigger thing
[0:14:04] <+SleepingPliskin> higu is literally friendship is magic lol
[0:14:06] <+0rangeBoyZ> Higurashi chapter 1 is free on steam right now
[0:14:08] <+0rangeBoyZ> Go read it
[0:14:09] <alephalpha> @0rangeBoyZ man the christmas scene really got em
[0:14:09] <chll0ne> whats this?

[0:14:47] <lennonbad> Ahh Woolie were would my song playlist be without you...
[0:14:47] <+0rangeBoyZ> That's one of Ryukishi's best pop offs

[0:22:48] <+captain_history> @Livelinne The manga just gaves more detail to the answer given in the novels. It makes it more direct instead of dancing around it.
[0:22:51] <+0rangeBoyZ> I've been rereading it a bunch with a buddy of mine
[0:22:57] <lennonbad> IT's like watching anime previews all over again...
[0:22:59] <+0rangeBoyZ> It actually makes sense
[0:23:02] <+SleepingPliskin> there's some things that are true but the small details seem purposefully off

[0:37:56] <haitakaa> higurashi is some fucked up shit tho
[0:38:00] <+Rykorr> oh yeah the fanart is VERY spoilery
[0:38:00] <+dmtjinni> LUL
[0:38:03] <+pectusumbra> Exactly!
[0:38:04] <black_pariah> its because the property is a murder mystery Clue style thing
[0:38:06] <Arnschen> It is but ehhhhhhhh
[0:38:08] <iamtheTwitchghost> it's fine
[0:38:09] <Solidnick18> just play with eyes closed
[0:38:11] <kairumustdie> >VN fighting games
[0:38:14] <SpookySpaghooti> Spoilers for your 8+ year old game
[0:38:19] <+pectusumbra> But yes, Meta mystery novels will have spoilers
[0:38:20] <%Livelinne> shiaLUL
[0:38:20] <kairumustdie> whens melty and fate/sword dance
[0:38:21] <ShinobiPhoenix> people are too sensitive about spoilers, the world is a spoiler
[0:38:22] <+ggbhtg> You haven't heard enough CD DRAMAS I guess
[0:38:27] <+Axle13j> I just googled the game and caught the stuff in chat WTF there's a higurashi/umineko fighting game?!?!
[0:38:28] <%Wool> Same problem with P4U lol
[0:38:30] <+Rykorr> the thing about umineko is that it's so dense that spoilers just make things more confusing
[0:38:31] <+pectusumbra> think of them as novels rather than games
[0:38:38] <+0rangeBoyZ> Umineko got properly translated and release as of year or so ago
[0:38:47] <%blaccbird914> blaccbird914 gifted a Tier 1 sub to Solidnick18! They have given 2 Gift Subs in the channel!

[0:38:56] <SpookySpaghooti> Imagine doing a DHC in Monopoly
[0:38:56] <%The_Timo> Monopoly is garbage and boring lol
[0:38:56] <+jiggy_snipe> has anyone actually finished a game of Monopoly?
[0:38:58] <Robot_Nixon_> what if you play monopoly in a sauna?
[0:39:08] <%ECRead> Monopoly is like C Tier
[0:39:08] <+captain_history> Umineko ended like 9 years ago
[0:39:09] <+ggbhtg> @WoolieVersus We know how to play, so it's hella competitive
[0:39:15] <+0rangeBoyZ> Also remember, Umineko is a murder mystery
[0:39:22] <TheGershon> The reason why Monopoly sucks is that everyone ignores the rules and plays unlimited rounds
[0:39:24] <FrostedZaibatsu> Monopoly "family friendly" well not my family
[0:39:25] <%SirGO0SE> most parker bros games are just dated / been done better
[0:39:29] <+0rangeBoyZ> That's the genre where spoilers are literally the worst
[0:39:29] <+Rykorr> the only spoilers in golden fantasia are in visual references to the VN
[0:39:29] <Man_in_the_Red> Monopoly is designed to be unfun so i guess it suceeded
[0:39:32] <%Solidnick18> thanks @blaccbird914 for the gift sub
[0:39:33] <+ggbhtg> We definitely got tier lists for each properties @WoolieVersus

[0:51:30] <+karmahoudini_guitar> who is playing whom?
[0:51:31] <+pectusumbra> To be fair, it looks like this because the family head is a westboo and europhile

[0:51:34] <%subjectg> kinzo loves that western shit

[1:13:11] <Icyterr0r> the low time warning being the clock is so good
[1:13:17] <+Superbro64> was it funded? Did they take the money and ran?
[1:13:21] <+karmahoudini_guitar> this whole game is a family feud

[1:25:46] <+ReiDuran> @WoolieVersus it's "Ronald" backwards because Ronald A. Knox. It's a mystery novel reference
[1:25:46] <devanmuse> Ronald Knox versus Van Dyne
[1:25:46] <iamtheTwitchghost> willard Kreygasm
[1:25:48] <alephalpha> she is a respresentaion oif the knox decalogue
[1:25:51] <Klefth> Oh god, that voice acting....
[1:25:52] <%subjectg> Knox’s decalogue is a big part of umineko
[1:25:54] <arkv01> has a broad audience
[1:25:55] <UltimateDomon> Whens Golden Nocturne
[1:25:56] <+Blokehat> People think it's weeb when it's actually westaboo af
[1:25:57] <Broand> Knox is a reference to a mystery novel writer
[1:26:08] <+nelsonjaydee> Yeah really.
[1:26:11] <blue6sub6remnant6> Who remembers Rule #5?
[1:26:16] <+pectusumbra> they are homing shots

[1:26:37] <alephalpha> dlanor has ashiedl super
[1:26:41] <chhdez> Did they play Beato yet?
[1:26:41] <alephalpha> which is amazing
[1:26:50] <RunoEddie> Umineko is like, 5 steps below Danganronpa in weeabooness, and that's way more popular nowadays
[1:26:51] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:26:51] <blue6sub6remnant6> Knox's fifth is "the answer is not flagrant racism."

[1:26:54] <whiteblacklight74> stand
[1:27:00] <+nelsonjaydee> I don't remember a thing from this game other than what happens in the first 4 episodes.
[1:27:00] <alephalpha> that sheild makes her unzonable
[1:27:27] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @karmahoudini_guitar
[1:27:28] <Klefth> That bunny girl's voice acting reminded me of the assholes who play catgirls with voice 5 in XIV

[1:27:40] <Thunderhog> Just take the throw dnoSMUG
[1:27:48] <gordieda20> THE GRAB MIX

[1:27:51] <n33t_1337> So do they know about all the meters?
[1:27:53] <+ReiDuran> Knox was pretty great because a lot of novels at the time had the "shifty foreigner" trope and it was just shitty as hell
[1:27:53] <RunoEddie> who the hell is this guy
[1:27:57] <RunoEddie> I don't remember him

[1:28:33] <+ReiDuran> A lot of people seem to not like him but Willard and Lion made a good pair
[1:28:36] <+zetastriker> The Answer arcs have a lot of new characters
[1:28:36] <+karmahoudini_guitar> 5 and 6 are the best games in the series
[1:28:43] <tearfuldevil> are kanon and dlanor using the same sort of wepaon?
[1:28:56] <+karmahoudini_guitar> Dlanor is using a a sword of red truth

[1:41:28] <+pectusumbra> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug just reminded of an old shit post with jessica and willard looking at Shannon and Lion
[1:41:32] <realestjojo> @dsd24 you know war and peace?
[1:41:33] <Starotter70> But I'm also a slow reader so
[1:41:40] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @okamidude15 a whole month of alternating between umineko and halo novels
[1:41:40] <realestjojo> try 3x the length st least
[1:41:42] <RunoEddie> @DSD24 enourmously long
[1:41:43] <UltimateDomon> It took me around 100 hours to read the whole thing
[1:41:46] <%DSD24> I do know War and Peace @realestjojo
[1:41:57] <hiroy_raind> 8 linear visual novel. You can finish one in a day/half a day
[1:41:58] <ha2ken> Oh my eyes have seen the jiggles
[1:42:00] <+pectusumbra> @DSD24 think of it as an 8 book series
[1:42:01] <chhdez> War and cold war
[1:42:02] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @pectusumbra I've never read umineko this means nothing to me
[1:42:03] <Arnschen> Can be around 60-80 hours
[1:42:07] <+wicketpelican> like wtf they are family or something but girl just brings a gun and shots her sister this is so sad
[1:42:08] <Shardlab> The Bounce is how you know it's ANime
[1:42:08] <alephalpha> 3 war and poeaces put togetehr is shprter than umineko
[1:42:10] <+ReiDuran> So using Rosa is pretty good because she plays keepaway while Jessica builds meter
[1:42:15] <chll0ne> jiggle? Kreygasm
[1:42:15] <make_eye> it's 100 hrs but there's still more material
[1:42:19] <Arnschen> It is it's own series
[1:42:20] <tearfuldevil> @realestjojo bitch i read Wheel of Time
[1:42:27] <dinnydanny777> She pulled out a dinner kart lmao
[1:42:27] <+Blokehat> I read it over the course of like 2 years
[1:42:29] <chhdez> Not just a family, but a rich family
[1:42:30] <RunoEddie> @wicketpelican no joke, that is nothing
[1:42:30] <alephalpha> it's like 200 hours
[1:42:34] <+wicketpelican> girl with a fuckin gun and dude with a teapot
[1:42:34] <+Superbro64> time to read the manga Kappa
[1:42:40] <realestjojo> then you'll be fine then!
[1:42:41] <+zetastriker> Yo, that was a cool move. Using metaverse to set up a counter. Too bad it didn't work
[1:42:47] <blue6sub6remnant6> So chat, is Shannon stuffing her shirt, or is the viewer/Ballter canonically having delusions about her chest?
[1:42:48] <OkamiDude15> woolie will spend at least 133 hours reading all of umineko
[1:42:49] <make_eye> 200 hrs is more realistic considering all the OTHER material
[1:42:52] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> the virgin umineko vs the chad smash bros brawl fanfic thats the second longest piece of literature known to man
[1:42:54] <+pectusumbra> True, there is a manga, but you would miss out on all the music, but you get awesome art
[1:42:56] <e1io> this is like the bastard child of Jojo, Grim, and Melty Blood all in one
[1:42:57] <Elsewize> Just do it!
[1:43:03] <+captain_history> Umineko is 8-10 hours per chapter
[1:43:06] <iamtheTwitchghost> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug wait what
[1:43:08] <devanmuse> Woolie on the podcast in two weekss: "So I read Umineko... Beatrice is the bae"
[1:43:18] <tearfuldevil> @realestjojo wheel of time is like 5 war and peaces
[1:43:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> so how does this work
[1:43:18] <gordieda20> LUL
[1:43:19] <realestjojo> and he'll be correct
[1:43:20] <alephalpha> we could only dream
[1:43:22] <chhdez> @devanmuse Well, its the truth
[1:43:27] <realestjojo> in more ways than one
[1:43:30] <+ReiDuran> Beato best
[1:43:31] <+wicketpelican> is the a mango or suave novel?
[1:43:32] <alephalpha> you could even say it in red
[1:43:33] <RunoEddie> Beato is greato
[1:43:38] <SailingSaturn> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug cirPat
[1:43:39] <realestjojo> say it in gold
[1:43:39] <+Vorga1339> is parsec a hamachi clone?
[1:43:40] <iamtheTwitchghost> beato Kreygasm
[1:43:43] <tearfuldevil> i think the only longer fantasy series in english is riftwar
[1:43:43] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> @devanmuse Then pat sandbags the fuck outta him
[1:43:44] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @iamthetwitchghost for a long time the longest piece of literature ever written was a smash bros fanfic but it recently got dethroned
[1:43:45] <Starotter70> It's a VN but there's also a Manga
[1:43:47] <OkamiDude15> woolie will figure it out next episode will cover all of umineko
[1:43:49] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @sailingsaturn cirComfy
[1:43:55] <+Superbro64> time to read the umineko vn, anime, manga, and re-watch through every vn updated releases to see the differences in each update :)
[1:43:55] <%CaptainPileDriver> also do we need anything to play with you besides a controller? @WoolieVersus
[1:43:56] <+pectusumbra> Alright, somebody, ANYBODY, we need the good meta shit! Knox and Erika please!
[1:43:57] <+zetastriker> But there's DEFINITELY NOT an anime
[1:44:00] <+zetastriker> >_>
[1:44:02] <+Superbro64> see you all in 2022 :)
[1:44:09] <iamtheTwitchghost> @any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug wow i never knew, gonna have to check that out atpRtsd
[1:44:17] <RunoEddie> I am kinda curious what is Woolie's impression on Umineko from what he might've heard
[1:44:26] <alephalpha> he's heard nothing
[1:44:29] <tearfuldevil> he knows nothing @RunoEddie
[1:44:32] <%wicketpelican> umineko looks like some extreme weeb shit
[1:44:34] <+Superbro64> people would spoil him on it?
[1:44:37] <realestjojo> Oh he'll never read it ever either
[1:44:38] <%Livelinne> !motivated
[1:44:38] <@Moobot> 1547 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[1:44:45] <%illtima> Wools if you have time check out yesterday's run of DMC4 at GDQ. The boss rush especially was FIRE.
[1:44:47] <@Solidus_113> you all best have your controllers set up and ready
[1:44:47] <%any_nep_subs_here_nepSmug> @wicketpelican Umineko is *peak* weeb shit
[1:44:48] <heartlesshealer> Good luck to all challengers!

[1:44:58] <+Superbro64> because from my knowledge, you cant say much without essentially spoiling the experience

[1:45:08] <@Moobot> 1549 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[1:45:15] <+Superbro64> lolno
[1:45:15] <realestjojo> the thing is this fighting game has a ton of spoilers with context
[1:45:17] <Nekros4442> Umineko isnt peak weebshit. Umineko is the portal to Higarashi which is true peak weebshit
[1:45:17] <KnivesEve> ah okay
[1:45:18] <%wicketpelican> is umineko more weeb than fate (besides zero)? or more weeb than kara no kyoukai?
[1:45:23] <+thrushjackson> !motivated
[1:45:23] <@Moobot> 1550 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!
[1:45:26] <+0rangeBoyZ> Read Umineko
[1:45:27] <+Superbro64> woolie has a life, unlike chat doodStare
[1:45:35] <+ReiDuran> Umineko is pretty weeb, but it's really really interesting
[1:45:42] <realestjojo> it's about on the same level of weeb as Kara no Kyoukai
[1:45:47] <Arnschen> Ye, read Umineko. V good
[1:45:53] <realestjojo> maybe as much as Tsukihime
[1:45:54] <RunoEddie> it's not more weeb than Danganronpa, and Woolie did read those
[1:45:57] <+ReiDuran> Read Umineko,
[1:45:57] <+karmahoudini_guitar> how do we get to play with Woolie?
[1:46:07] <blue6sub6remnant6> @Superbro64 That's hurtful. Are you judging how I process grief?
[1:46:08] <RunoEddie> it's also better than Danganronpa
[1:46:11] <Arnschen> ^
[1:46:14] <+dmtjinni> Woolz
[1:46:14] <%wicketpelican> but danranronpan has style u know looks like not weeb shit so woolie likes style
[1:46:15] <%Livelinne> Read Umineko woolieSMUG
[1:46:18] <RunoEddie> and I love Danganronpa
[1:46:22] <OkamiDude15> is there an audio book of umineko? sfhSMUG
[1:46:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> Short break or are we already done with the stream?
[1:46:29] <realestjojo> @runoeddie realest shit said here
[1:46:31] <+ReiDuran> Yeah, but it's WAY more involved than Danganronpa. Trying to read Umineko will take a fuckload of time.
[1:46:32] <%BisoromiBear> Read Umineko, it's only a little over a million words.
[1:46:35] <+DenpaDev> in terms of story it's better, but there is way more
[1:46:40] <n33t_1337> How are you gonna do an audio book on blue and red text
[1:46:41] <%wicketpelican> umineko doesnt have style its just girls and dresses and dude fighting with teapot and a fuckin gun
[1:46:43] <+Superbro64> If I want a good reading experience in an afternoon, I wouls replay Ghost Trick
[1:46:43] <OkamiDude15> @CommanderSqueaks setting up parsec for matches
[1:46:46] <%huskarl_zap> @karmahoudini_guitar download a sus program that runs off your system folder
[1:46:52] <Starotter70> There WAS going to be an Audio drama
[1:47:01] <+Vorga1339> Is Parsec legit enough to play fighting games with? I'm looking at the site and it looks like a stadia style streaming thing.
[1:47:05] <+Vorga1339> never heard of it before
[1:47:08] <+ReiDuran> Umineko is a murder mystery
[1:47:10] <+Superbro64> there are a heck of lot of vns out there
[1:47:11] <Isphone555> Woolie WILL figure it out
[1:47:21] <OkamiDude15> @Vorga1339 its pretty legit
[1:47:24] <%wicketpelican> audio drama is really weeb like u listening the worst part of anime that is squicky japanese voices without the cool shit that is the cartoon thats peak weeb
[1:47:30] <iamtheTwitchghost> @Vorga1339 it's used to play UMVC3 online, yeah it's legit
[1:47:31] <Arnschen> We believe in you Woolie
[1:47:31] <+Zelretch3000> Umineko characters can body Goku with a teapot

[1:48:44] <floralkami> @vorga1339 it runs off your computer, so no. it wouldn't be anything as bad as stadia. and yes, it's VERY popular for playing games with bad netcode, like UMVC3 and DBFZ
[1:48:54] <Isphone555> I clicked it, but forgot my controller's broken. #Johns.
[1:49:08] <%Irridium> i keep getting timed out
[1:49:15] <+Superbro64> should people parsec'ing pause the stream?
[1:49:21] <%ekodrop> parsec doesn't queue properluy right? it just times out?

[1:51:58] <chll0ne> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:52:01] <%ekodrop> i bet it's a the controller has to be connected to the game
[1:52:05] <rmwolfe> i hope this works, its a great idea for the stream
[1:52:06] <%ekodrop> when it starts
[1:52:09] <%WutangchickeN> maybe the controller isn't being recognized?
[1:52:09] <%JuliusGemstone> psaHoldon psaHoldon psaHoldon psaHoldon
[1:52:14] <Nekros4442> it's a learning process chat. Once the kinks get worked out this'll be gud
[1:52:16] <lem______> parseeeeeeec
[1:52:17] <+jiggy_snipe> disconnect Reggie's controller maybe
[1:52:20] <%RunningNGunning> Maybe its a game issue rather than a parsec issue
[1:52:21] <%Irridium> nope
[1:52:26] <%WutangchickeN> it's all good homies.
[1:52:26] <Arnschen> Turn off and back on?
[1:52:27] <+jiggy_snipe> so you only have 2 controllers
[1:52:34] <%WutangchickeN> play kb+m!
[1:52:40] <+karmahoudini_guitar> yeah probably need to disconnect Reggie
[1:52:41] <%JuliusGemstone> we can do this bois
[1:52:48] <+karmahoudini_guitar> the game probably only supports two controllers

[1:57:47] <chhdez> Its a really sick gun
[1:57:53] <%WutangchickeN> @solidus_113 could you mention a parsec command for the bot to Woolie?
[1:58:00] <realestjojo> hey if it can happen to her sisters
[1:58:05] <%WutangchickeN> might help
[1:58:05] <realestjojo> why not herself

[1:58:18] <make_eye> no
[1:58:20] <+pectusumbra> Aunt and NIece
[1:58:27] <@Solidus_113> It'd likely change with each game, and it's only something Woolie'd want to allow in the moment, no need for a bot command
[1:58:28] <TheSaltminer> MAGIC ISN'T REAL
[1:58:30] <make_eye> Rosa is someone else's mom
[1:58:31] <arkv01> the bullet is her daughter
[1:58:33] <TheGoldMaiden> Maria is Rosa's daughter
[1:58:35] <+karmahoudini_guitar> Maria is Rosa's daughter
[1:58:41] <%WutangchickeN> yeah that makes sense
[1:58:43] <Starotter70> SourPls
[1:58:44] <make_eye> BOAT STAGE
[1:59:00] <RunoEddie> is Jessiva's mom even in this game?
[1:59:04] <realestjojo> nope
[1:59:07] <make_eye> probably not
[1:59:10] <realestjojo> but she has a color
[1:59:12] <Starotter70> Nah, just her color scheme
[1:59:14] <realestjojo> with jessica
[1:59:20] <+captain_history> it's Maria charging the second gun, she is not the bullet
[1:59:22] <+ReiDuran> Natsuhi is great
[1:59:29] <%WutangchickeN> is this based off some larger universe?

[2:00:06] <+ReiDuran> but just once
[2:00:09] <alephalpha> they are all gun moms except asumu
[2:00:11] <realestjojo> technically Higurashi and Umineko take place in the same world.....technically
[2:00:12] <gordieda20> just ignore that LUL
[2:00:15] <Arnschen> But all the stuff happening in this game is from the Visual Novel
[2:00:20] <%WutangchickeN> yeeted a baby LUL
[2:00:21] <dinnydanny777> Who yeeted a baby?
[2:00:22] <SplatFight> Heya

[2:00:48] <blue6sub6remnant6> @realestjojo Okonogi would like to point out that it's more than "technically."
[2:00:50] <+pectusumbra> both fighter's partners have full meter
[2:00:53] <@Solidus_113> Golden Fantasia X
[2:01:01] <alephalpha> @heartlesshealer have you not finished umijneko?

[2:01:17] <heartlesshealer> @alephalpha No I haven't
[2:01:17] <tearfuldevil> @pectusumbra i don't think they know how the emter stuff works
[2:01:17] <Arnschen> Yeah, this game really wants you to switch alot cause partners build the meter
[2:01:28] <alephalpha> welp sorry then
[2:01:28] <Quigsies> This is chat's reminder to read umineko, it's good

[2:01:45] <alephalpha> qepisode 5 stuff
[2:01:47] <+ReiDuran> don't worry about the baby yeeting
[2:01:47] <+0rangeBoyZ> If it's the anime the baby yeeting isn't in it
[2:01:49] <Arnschen> Oh god, baby yeeting
[2:01:50] <heartlesshealer> @alephalpha It's cool, as long as I don't find out which baby until it happens
[2:01:51] <%WutangchickeN> @quigsies what percentage of the manga is baby yeeting???
[2:01:53] <+ReiDuran> just keep reading it's fine
[2:01:59] <+0rangeBoyZ> Also Natsuhi didn't technically yeet the baby

[2:03:36] <@Solidus_113> woolieSPICE

[2:05:16] <+pectusumbra> @tearfuldevil she does a fan for her school's festival, and the game makes it into a nico nico type thing with text flying across the screen while she dresses like a touhou
[2:05:16] <hiroy_raind> Any of you played Rose Guns Days? Was it good?
[2:05:18] <Starotter70> Murder
[2:05:22] <realestjojo> that's the best part. that this fighting game simultaneously spoils a lot and nothing at the same time
[2:05:26] <alephalpha> @RunoEddie yes a powerfuls tory about living with grief and the cycle of abuse and the natur eof love wrapped witha meta murde rmsytery
[2:05:26] <+pectusumbra> *band

[2:05:26] <Quigsies> Umineko is a murder mystery
[2:05:27] <Arnschen> Rose Guns Days was pretty good from what I played
[2:05:28] <%WutangchickeN> @starotter70 YEYE I'd make u one if it wasn't for the covids

[2:07:10] <tearfuldevil> honkers
[2:07:14] <floralkami> the bird fucking talks, omg
[2:07:21] <Meekest> I never noticed the bird talks
[2:07:24] <%Malik1002> ijust want to win
[2:07:26] <+pectusumbra> Reggie, the meta is MIDAIR
[2:07:28] <Quigsies> Oh Erika, you great rat
[2:07:32] <Meekest> It has Battler's voice OMEGALUL
[2:07:35] <chhdez> Bird is the word
[2:07:37] <floralkami> one thing worst than a goose.... a talking seagull
[2:07:46] <devanmuse> I mean... I'm sure there's a fragment where Shannon talks to birds... Catbox and shit
[2:08:10] <alephalpha> true
[2:08:16] <BlackermanZX> BIRB
[2:08:20] <%SirGO0SE> @floralkami DansGame
[2:08:23] <%BisoromiBear> he figured it out
[2:08:28] <+pectusumbra> YES. You build meter for your PARTNER
[2:08:31] <alephalpha> you build meter for the otehr character
[2:08:31] <iamtheTwitchghost> yeah
[2:08:33] <Arnschen> The partner gains meter in the background
[2:08:33] <blue6sub6remnant6> Guys, he figured it out.
[2:08:37] <heartlesshealer> BOX
[2:08:39] <realestjojo> and they realize
[2:08:40] <townzzzzz> you build meter for the other character
[2:08:45] <dinnydanny777> Everybody knows that the bird is the word
[2:08:48] <rmwolfe> ah, woolie's golden truth
[2:08:50] <tearfuldevil> @WoolieVersus the partner gains meter in the background
[2:08:58] <floralkami> @SirGO0SE don't deny the TROOF
[2:09:11] <%sparkly_yoyo> Hey I just arrived, has Battler found out that all truth is lies?
[2:09:12] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:09:15] <+pectusumbra> And that's why there's only one health meter, you can't lose your partner in this game or it wouldn't work
[2:09:29] <+Superbro64> street fighter ex 3 may, I cant remember
[2:09:34] <+pectusumbra> wasn't able to do the command
[2:09:52] <+Superbro64> I do now that if your partner dies in ex3, you get 6 bars instead of 3, as a comeback mechanic
[2:09:54] <floralkami> @WoolieVersus you know that isn't true; MeltyBlood maids are all competent
[2:09:56] <rmwolfe> kohaku has potted plants
[2:09:57] <dinnydanny777> There should be a maid character who throws projectile plates, like bullets
[2:10:11] <tearfuldevil> thats not kohaku
[2:10:11] <TimetodiveLTX> kohaku attacks with broom, plants, and BOMBS
[2:10:14] <+Saggitori> didn't touhou do knife maid
[2:10:14] <tearfuldevil> thats the other one
[2:10:20] <+pectusumbra> yes
[2:10:20] <blue6sub6remnant6> Wait, Woolie is reading chat? Everybody STFU about the story.
[2:10:28] <+ReiDuran> Erika's Meta is F->HCF->C in the air, by the way
[2:10:29] <spardanwarrior> DIO knife maid
[2:10:29] <Starotter70> I think Kanon can jump off walls
[2:10:31] <+Superbro64> what maid doesnt have a bomb?
[2:10:39] <e1io> I'm pretty sure half the people don't know the story
[2:10:44] <floralkami> @blue6sub6remnant6 all of it is going right over his head, lol
[2:10:45] <tearfuldevil> @blue6sub6remnant6 its cute you think woolie will ever consume umineko, and that he gives a fuck about spoilers
[2:10:51] <+paladinstarbuster> @blue6sub6remnant6 hes never gonna read umineko dude
[2:10:52] <chhdez> Its about crazy shit
[2:10:55] <heartlesshealer> yeah touhou had knife maid with time abilities
[2:10:57] <tearfuldevil> (umineko spoilers, i mean)
[2:11:04] <gordieda20> he ain't reading umineko
[2:11:05] <+Vorga1339> @blue6sub6remnant6 you think this dude has time for a vn between all of the other plates he's spinning
[2:11:09] <tearfuldevil> hell, i don't know umineko, and most people here don't
[2:11:10] <blue6sub6remnant6> Well guys, that's fair.
[2:11:10] <Arnschen> Woolie reading Umineko haha
[2:11:10] <iamtheTwitchghost> umineko spoilers make no sense either way lol
[2:11:12] <TimetodiveLTX> hisui, her sister, is the one that attacks with cooking tools, dust, vases
[2:11:19] <+AsinPersuasion> where are the girls tho
[2:11:19] <tearfuldevil> you weebs are jsut spouting references we don't get
[2:11:20] <heartlesshealer> Bird gang
[2:11:20] <%sparkly_yoyo> knowing the story doesn't guarantee you *know* the story
[2:11:22] <+AsinPersuasion> those are both boys
[2:11:24] <dinnydanny777> bu bu bird bird bird
[2:11:32] <+pectusumbra> the seagulls are GREAT in this game though
[2:11:35] <TimetodiveLTX> and like a hypnotism beam? i don't get it
[2:11:35] <%SirGO0SE> birb gang birb gang birb gang
[2:11:37] <gordieda20> LUL
[2:11:42] <@Solidus_113> https://parsec.gg/g/1fF6Rc9CAwlFtOLFTtMsAAx5qli/8aa6c28e/
[2:11:57] <realestjojo> if Woolie ain't ever getting into Fate what would make you think he'd EVER get into Umineko
[2:11:59] <+Blokehat> Dudeakoff here, ggs I'm bad lol
[2:12:01] <%Solidnick18> huh
[2:12:14] <tearfuldevil> i keep getting timed out, is there a setting i can do to like, wiat?
[2:12:18] <+ReiDuran> Yeah there's no way
[2:12:24] <+ReiDuran> ZEN ZEN DAMEDA
[2:12:25] <Arnschen> Dame da
[2:12:25] <devanmuse> I'm waiting for woolie to get swept by a fucking KILLER at this game
[2:12:25] <%Livelinne> one can believe woolieDATTEBAYO
[2:12:26] <floralkami> damn, how does this thing work? how do we know we are in a queue? is there a queue?
[2:12:28] <tearfuldevil> cause it jsut says "connection timed out" after a couple seconds
[2:12:28] <UltimateDomon> He said the thing
[2:12:36] <tearfuldevil> @floralkami i dunno
[2:12:46] <TimetodiveLTX> no one plays ougon
[2:12:51] <%emperordread> who's this black suit phoneix wright looking dude?
[2:12:53] <Arnschen> Oh man Woolie
[2:12:57] <heartlesshealer> yeah I see it
[2:12:58] <Meekest> Oh Woolie
[2:12:59] <TimetodiveLTX> please play ougon
[2:13:01] <%JuliusGemstone> yeyeyeyeyeeye
[2:13:02] <+ReiDuran> @WoolieVersus it's called OPPAI FINGER
[2:13:03] <BlackermanZX> holy shit yeah
[2:13:04] <chhdez> He reminds me of P Wright he says
[2:13:07] <+pectusumbra> This is your ryu in this game
[2:13:12] <+pectusumbra> his ability is health regen
[2:13:13] <RunoEddie> I'd say it's different cause Fate fans are more numerous and they actively annoy Pat and Woolie but yeah, they won't fucking read Umineko, it's pointless to even think about it
[2:13:15] <gordieda20> Ye The blue truth bois
[2:13:22] <%Livelinne> d, dad color... shiaCry
[2:13:28] <rmwolfe> no, theyre saying youre right
[2:13:32] <%sparkly_yoyo> Battler is basically Phoenix Lite
[2:13:36] <Arnschen> No, it's that you are closer than you know
[2:13:36] <+ReiDuran> Yeah they're saying you're right
[2:13:38] <chhdez> Just use the super Woolie
[2:13:40] <+paladinstarbuster> theyre AGREEING WOOLIE
[2:13:40] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[2:13:41] <iamtheTwitchghost> that's the joke
[2:13:41] <BlackermanZX> goddamn Wright is the best
[2:13:42] <Meekest> No Woolie you're just more right than you know
[2:13:43] <%BisoromiBear> you're more right than you could ever know
[2:13:45] <kasios> how is this debatable
[2:13:46] <+ReiDuran> Battler is basically Phoenix
[2:13:47] <%huskarl_zap> BURD
[2:13:49] <@Moobot> Stop yelling @alephalpha
[2:13:50] <heartlesshealer> wow
[2:13:51] <floralkami> @WoolieVersus they were agreeing with you
[2:13:53] <Starotter70> Battler is very inspired by Phoenix
[2:13:58] <tearfuldevil> he's bassically a lawyer i think
[2:13:58] <+pectusumbra> He's the protagonist and an idiot
[2:13:59] <+xeros720> hmm, battler is definitely a reference to phoenix, but the fighting moveset might be a reference to this game
[2:14:02] <Starotter70> Nah
[2:14:02] <Arnschen> He has arguments
[2:14:02] <Lichzim> PogChamp
[2:14:03] <%JuliusGemstone> WHAT!?
[2:14:07] <rmwolfe> no, he just likes mysteries and points
[2:14:07] <heartlesshealer> is he shooting energy birds out of his hand?
[2:14:07] <+pectusumbra> no, he's a highschooler
[2:14:08] <%JuliusGemstone> found my main
[2:14:08] <+ReiDuran> Not a lawyer but arguments are his weapon
[2:14:08] <+xeros720> no, he just fights peoplle with logics
[2:14:09] <%huskarl_zap> ahh the evil character
[2:14:09] <KalmVibrations> He's a person who argues a lot
[2:14:10] <Isphone555> Haha funney
[2:14:13] <gordieda20> He argues
[2:14:14] <%Livelinne> no hes 18 y o
[2:14:14] <%BisoromiBear> he's an objector
[2:14:15] <realestjojo> well...he sure does discuss truth and logic!
[2:14:20] <realestjojo> never forget
[2:14:21] <%sparkly_yoyo> Asking a person to read Umineko is basically asking someone to give up half their life
[2:14:25] <+pectusumbra> He left his family for 7 years and the first time he comes back, MURDERS
[2:14:26] <realestjojo> he's incompetent!
[2:14:28] <devanmuse> he is INCOMPETENT though
[2:14:32] <realestjojo> said in red truth!
[2:14:34] <+ReiDuran> @WoolieVersus He uses the Blue Truth
[2:14:36] <$SilverRoddo> BLEETZ
[2:14:36] <alephalpha> INCOMPETENT IN RED
[2:14:37] <%SirGO0SE> mic peaking?
[2:14:37] <knackirontarkus> SMALL BOMBS
[2:14:38] <@Solidus_113> oof the audio
[2:14:40] <Nero270> @WoolieVersus Supposed to be "logic" character, but the story subverts it in an interesting way
[2:14:45] <%sparkly_yoyo> I forgot is red lies?
[2:14:45] <Meekest> Where's the small bombs
[2:14:50] <chhdez> He's the Doogie Howser of lawyers eh
[2:14:50] <%WutangchickeN> why the hell are like half the characters related to that clown dude from the Yakuza series? Bob Utsunomiya?
[2:14:54] <floralkami> @WoolieVersus your mic cant handle all this truth and meta
[2:14:55] <realestjojo> nah where's the trap doors
[2:14:57] <+pectusumbra> Canon!
[2:15:02] <Arnschen> He did the EX
[2:15:03] <+xeros720> oh, there's the transform mechanic
[2:15:05] <gordieda20> Red are absolute truth
[2:15:05] <iamtheTwitchghost> LUL
[2:15:07] <%huskarl_zap> hands on? PogChamp
[2:15:09] <whiteblacklight74> he's not a lawyer but he's mystery vn guy
[2:15:11] <+xeros720> it works like a roman cancel
[2:15:11] <%sparkly_yoyo> Ah I had it backwards
[2:15:12] <TheGoldMaiden> If only Battler did that in ep 1
[2:15:18] <devanmuse> that wasn't canon
[2:15:30] <%sparkly_yoyo> Umineko's not canon
[2:15:32] <alephalpha> @WutangchickeN cause there was a guy named kinzo who amassed a fortuen off of relationships with the ghq and cuthroat invetsments

[2:19:59] <%huskarl_zap> rosa the sickest dude Kappa
[2:20:00] <Carefree_Kaleidoscope> honestly idk how anyone would get spoiled on plot from this, it all requires so much context to not just be percieved as randomness
[2:20:02] <alephalpha> @devanmuse peopel who lack hormones age more gracefully
[2:20:05] <%WutangchickeN> Beatrice must be OD cuz I swear she's been picked more than 60% of the time
[2:20:15] <%sparkly_yoyo> @Carefree_Kaleidoscope context only helps sometimes
[2:20:21] <alephalpha> @devanmuse welle xcept for the hoprrible boen brittleness
[2:20:22] <realestjojo> nah Umineko is very possible to spoil but no one is going for it at least

[2:25:17] <+pectusumbra> and yes Erika is nuts. DEVIL WE NEED THAT ERIKA META
[2:25:33] <Klefth> Some of these character designs really slip into *that* realm of weebiness...
[2:25:34] <$SilverRoddo> How did she put on leggings?
[2:25:35] <MusouMiko> yeah isn't erika stupid good in this
[2:25:38] <kasios> WHY IS SHE SO HYPE THO
[2:25:38] <%sparkly_yoyo> Have they player as Funny Karate George?
[2:25:39] <Meekest> For real we need some killers in these lobbies, Erika is top tier for a reason
[2:25:47] <%sparkly_yoyo> played*
[2:25:51] <alephalpha> @MusouMiko nope erika is like mid tier
[2:26:00] <heartlesshealer> mada mada
[2:26:01] <Arnschen> She's in Episode 5, right after the anime ended
[2:26:04] <floralkami> @SilverRoddo surrounded by all this magic, and that's your question? LUL
[2:26:16] <realestjojo> @klefth you'd be surprised that it actually isn't
[2:26:18] <%WutangchickeN> ...there's an ANIME???
[2:26:22] <alephalpha> @floralkami what magic?
[2:26:27] <+kewlmyc> GREAT EQUALIZER IS THE DEATH
[2:26:27] <$SilverRoddo> BabyRage

[2:26:36] <realestjojo> @wutangchicken no and don't believe anyone's lies that there are
[2:26:36] <Arnschen> Still sad we never got an anime version of Erika, even though the anime was terrible
[2:26:42] <floralkami> @alephalpha you're right, what was i thinking?
[2:26:43] <gordieda20> OH DESIRE
[2:26:43] <chhdez> *Conjures a giant flan* Magic doesnt exist!
[2:26:49] <%WutangchickeN> @realestjojo good lol

[2:27:51] <alephalpha> kanon is in this

[2:28:11] <BlackermanZX> can you launch into air shot
[2:28:12] <+jiggy_snipe> so how's the latency over parsec for people who had to connect?
[2:28:17] <floralkami> oh, so the mizuumi wiki is where you find data on the poverty games?
[2:28:23] <damienlunas> Jessica is literally the only character in this entire series who doesn't deserve death.
[2:28:26] <@akuda_bar> rosa is so fucking crazy
[2:28:28] <iamtheTwitchghost> @floralkami yep
[2:28:33] <Arnschen> Rosa is great

[2:28:35] <%huskarl_zap> Rosa shoots up the church just like dante would of done
[2:28:48] <tearfuldevil> yeah i dont know why i bothered
[2:28:48] <devanmuse> oh shit, the pen stab
[2:28:50] <chhdez> Pretty much no one deserved those deaths
[2:28:51] <alephalpha> @damienlunas umm I feel like you're missing acouple
[2:29:00] <Professor_Rakor> Child, fetch me more gun.
[2:29:08] <damienlunas> Name one more
[2:29:15] <alephalpha> maria
[2:29:18] <+Zelretch3000> uuu gun uuu uuuuu
[2:29:24] <%ekodrop> capt
[2:29:39] <$SilverRoddo> Those church-goers were nonplussed that there was a sick fight happening.
[2:29:43] <+kewlmyc> @chhdez Nah, the Ushiromiya family is filled with a bunch of crazy assholes. Some definitely deserved those deaths.
[2:29:44] <%JuliusGemstone> do it. noooo
[2:29:48] <%JuliusGemstone> cap noio
[2:29:52] <damienlunas> Only if you're willing to give her the child pass
[2:29:53] <%CaptainPileDriver> no
[2:29:56] <@akuda_bar> i dunno if anyone deserves having their organs replaced with candy tho
[2:29:57] <Arnschen> Awww, Capt'n
[2:30:00] <%CaptainPileDriver> NOOOOOOOOO
[2:30:00] <alephalpha> @kewlmyc most people would say most of them did
[2:30:01] <heartlesshealer> oh no
[2:30:01] <%sparkly_yoyo> once again, morally gray
[2:30:01] <%CaptainPileDriver> I DID
[2:30:11] <chhdez> @chhdez Not those specific deaths yo
[2:30:14] <realestjojo> @kewlmyc the kids didn't (although Battler is a point of contention)
[2:30:15] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[2:30:16] <Arnschen> I mean, I'd have my organs replaced with candy
[2:30:16] <%JuliusGemstone> riiiip
[2:30:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> i'm there
[2:30:36] <%JuliusGemstone> get it cap
[2:30:37] <+Zelretch3000> pat would
[2:30:42] <%JuliusGemstone> eyyyy
[2:30:53] <realestjojo> the spouses to the adults didn't really deserve the deaths either
[2:30:53] <@akuda_bar> yeah i wouldn't go "yeah that guy was an asshole he deserved to get mpreg with snickers bars"
[2:30:54] <%JuliusGemstone> NOOOO
[2:30:58] <alephalpha> @realestjojo battler's sin when you sonsider 12 year old going to live with his grandparents cause his dad is a cheater is kinda yeah
[2:31:05] <%SirGO0SE> connection timed out means its too unstable or full?
[2:31:10] <%CaptainPileDriver> all i have is my shitty laptop
[2:31:11] <+kewlmyc> @realestjojo Yeah, Maria and Jessica are pretty innocent. George is also cool, and Battler is only implied to be a total asshole.
[2:31:11] <%sparkly_yoyo> magic ain't real anyway so nothing happened
[2:31:17] <%JuliusGemstone> Is it?!
[2:31:21] <@akuda_bar> battler's sin is sexualizing his baby cousin
[2:31:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> that doesn't have an ethernet port

[2:32:38] <damienlunas> Umineko has cool bits but there is honestly a lot of problems with it that you have to put up with to get to it.
[2:32:48] <floralkami> @JuliusGemstone may be on wire, but you still a redbar Kappa
[2:32:50] <realestjojo> @kewlmyc if you do it make sure you gets the modded ps3 sprites

[2:32:59] <@akuda_bar> i'm the most surface umineko fan. i only got into it a few months ago and i read slow, so i'm only on the end of ch 2

[2:35:01] <Potatoidea> Is this a Umineko fighter?
[2:35:04] <chhdez> Right in the kisser
[2:35:07] <+Blokehat> Parsec working better than some games' native netcode oughta be kinda embarsssing
[2:35:11] <+kewlmyc> I love that everyone thought George was fat due to the bad original art
[2:35:12] <floralkami> @Potatoidea yep
[2:35:15] <@akuda_bar> jessica punching battler in the dick is canon
[2:35:17] <Potatoidea> Thanks
[2:35:27] <TimetodiveLTX> yeah, this game is supposed to have rollback on PC as well.
[2:35:38] <%JuliusGemstone> @ekodrop nah nah I see how it is, talking the game but to scared to finish the fight.
[2:35:59] <@akuda_bar> hopefully by watching this i'll be motivated to finish reading
[2:36:29] <%ekodrop> @JuliusGemstone what fight? you lag so hard you wouldn't be able to move
[2:36:33] <Arnschen> As you get to the later episodes and things pick up, you'll def be more interested
[2:36:39] <gordieda20> I like how they picked Rosa over any of the Gun mom
[2:36:41] <%ekodrop> @JuliusGemstone automatic 0-2
[2:36:45] <gordieda20> moms*

[2:38:13] <%heideste> LUL LUL
[2:38:22] <Potatoidea> All I know about Umineko is that there's witches, everyone dresses fancy, and one of the songs has a sample of Data from Star Trek in it; maybe this'll teach me more
[2:38:25] <+Zelretch3000> sad that no one did Erika meta
[2:38:25] <chhdez> Child abuse is only ok when children are not involved

[2:39:39] <chhdez> Those-rich-assholes
[2:39:42] <aquatic_lotus> bird gang
[2:39:50] <realestjojo> are has exactly the voice she does
[2:39:52] <iamtheTwitchghost> atpRtsd
[2:39:59] <+0rangeBoyZ> *any chance you can get in 1 person who actively plays the game*
[2:39:59] <realestjojo> *she has
[2:40:01] <+kewlmyc> Umineko pretty much boils down to "yeah rich people suck"
[2:40:09] <damienlunas> My biggest issue by far with Umineko is with the 1st chapter. Both Battler and George not seeing that [Redacted] isn't there, but the narration making you think [Redacted] is there.
[2:40:10] <biomegabear> aageis reflector normals maid
[2:40:11] <@akuda_bar> she sure has a voice @realestjojo
[2:40:12] <chll0ne> woolieKICKDAD
[2:40:17] <@akuda_bar> now i'm judging George so hard
[2:40:19] <+0rangeBoyZ> First chapter is kinda slow
[2:40:37] <chhdez> "We're super rich and hot, but bored, we should totally kill each other"
[2:40:37] <Arnschen> Oh wait Akuda, are you playing it with the PS3 Patch?
[2:40:38] <@akuda_bar> yeah 0rangeboy deserves it
[2:40:41] <+Blokehat> trading sweeps is always great
[2:40:50] <+ReiDuran> EVA a shit
[2:40:51] <%JuliusGemstone> just got to shake it off though, I'll get there.
[2:40:54] <Arnschen> With the voices and PS3 sprites?
[2:40:55] <@akuda_bar> @Arnschen nope, vanilla steam. i don't hate the retro models so it's FINE
[2:40:56] <+ReiDuran> this post made by Ange gang
[2:41:03] <+0rangeBoyZ> Dude you can judge george cause he's trying to date a 16 year old
[2:41:05] <+0rangeBoyZ> And he's 23
[2:41:12] <@akuda_bar> h-he what. did i not notice that
[2:41:13] <alephalpha> he thinks she's 19 but styill
[2:41:20] <%heideste> ange gang lmao
[2:41:21] <Arnschen> Ahh, yeah the og sprites are at least better than the Pachinko sprites
[2:41:21] <+0rangeBoyZ> yeahhhhhhhh
[2:41:24] <+Zelretch3000> who's the biggest milf of the spouse?
[2:41:27] <+0rangeBoyZ> ALso it's alright Akuda
[2:41:28] <iamtheTwitchghost> monkaS
[2:41:31] <+0rangeBoyZ> i guess I accepted my fate
[2:41:33] <+kewlmyc> Ange got is so bad, like holy shit.
[2:41:42] <damienlunas> George is also kind of a creep? Like his interactions with Shannon make him feel kind of niceguyish.
[2:41:44] <WG101> okay, yeah, rosa had every right to beat george's ass that last match
[2:41:50] <biomegabear> that's an akuma super
[2:41:53] <ha2ken> Why isn't there a Home Alone fighting game?
[2:41:55] <alephalpha> @damienlunas george is 200%a creep
[2:41:59] <chhdez> Is this the game where the VN has the weirdest perspective using photos as BG?
[2:42:00] <@akuda_bar> george seems wholesome in chapter 2 but i can see him getting.. bad
[2:42:07] <+0rangeBoyZ> I will make a funny video from me calling out Woolie and telling him not to do the fucking fan art
[2:42:19] <tearfuldevil> @ha2ken cause the characters would be kevin, theif 1, thief 2, pigeon lady
[2:42:21] <+kewlmyc> George is incel in the making, is what I'm hearing?
[2:42:24] <TheSaltminer> Shannon or Hisui?
[2:42:26] <tearfuldevil> kind of a smallc ast list
[2:42:28] <%emperordread> Wakeup birds are called Roosters
[2:42:36] <SpiritOfThuggery> George goes to r/braincell daily
[2:42:38] <alephalpha> once again depending on if you have love in your ehart you can intepret most characters extremely fdifferently
[2:42:40] <Sulfur_Boride> What's this game? Doesn't look bad.
[2:42:41] <@akuda_bar> @kewlmyc he's not an incel he's just the kind of guy who would retire with a 20 year old wife
[2:42:48] <damienlunas> If I show her these Fish she HAS to have sex with me.
[2:42:53] <Potatoidea> Oh hey, there's a cat in the background

[2:43:10] <alephalpha> @kewlmyc there's literallya aprt in the novel where george describe shimself being an incel and getting over that
[2:43:11] <+Blokehat> George used to be an incel, literally used to think he was the ultimate gentleman
[2:43:12] <heartlesshealer> Ougon Musou Kyoku Cross
[2:43:20] <Sulfur_Boride> Not what I meant, but I guess I deserved it regardless

[2:45:30] <@akuda_bar> you could potentially like it, honestly. but you don't have the time, at least
[2:45:32] <+pectusumbra> Maybe look at the manga
[2:45:36] <+ReiDuran> Umineko is cool but this is 0% Woolie's jam.
[2:45:38] <+0rangeBoyZ> read the manga!
[2:45:39] <chhdez> Could you show off some spoopy supers?
[2:45:41] <Arnschen> The manga is legit amazing
[2:45:42] <+0rangeBoyZ> It's super sick
[2:45:44] <damienlunas> Yeah Umineko is fucking LONG. And repetitive.
[2:45:44] <Meekest> Yeah just read a 120 hour VN
[2:45:44] <+Superbro64> How about we play fighting games here chat :)
[2:45:49] <fangovafang> wats good woolie n chat

[2:45:59] <Sulfur_Boride> Tricky, you say?
[2:45:59] <realestjojo> I will say tho that him liking Dangan Ronpa he would def appreciate aspects of Umineko
[2:46:00] <MethodiaLordae> HERE WE GO GAMERS
[2:46:03] <+kewlmyc> Problem is that there's like a different manga for each episode. Shit's confusing
[2:46:04] <@akuda_bar> he'd like all the debating and shit, but it's also 120 fucking hours long
[2:46:04] <chll0ne> @blackermanzx yes
[2:46:05] <Arnschen> And does the story justice tbh
[2:46:05] <alephalpha> 120hours si jusy for questions arcs
[2:46:07] <+0rangeBoyZ> if you didn't get to play ougon and you have it I'll play with you

[2:46:24] <chhdez> Let's all buy it
[2:46:26] <+ReiDuran> The first like, 20-30 hours of Umineko are all setup and it's super slow.
[2:46:27] <+0rangeBoyZ> Trust me, Umineko is well worth trying
[2:46:31] <chll0ne> unless its looking at the character designs from fgo on danbooru
[2:46:32] <+pectusumbra> for anyone that wants to see them, there's a youtube video of all the meta and super moves
[2:46:32] <rmwolfe> woolie would genuinely hate umineko's themes
[2:46:33] <%CaptainPileDriver> NUNS4 can connect
[2:46:37] <%sparkly_yoyo> Umineko is a full time job

[2:48:02] <@akuda_bar> yeah it's like five times slower than phoenix wright
[2:48:04] <+Superbro64> There's a collection coming to steam / ps4 at some point in fact

[2:49:04] <Sulfur_Boride> Is his name actually supposed to be "Pierre", but localization and Engrish?
[2:49:06] <+pectusumbra> Also, YEAH BLACK BATTLER IS BIG SPOILERS
[2:49:10] <blue6sub6remnant6> "Sprites from MUGEN" That sounds about right.
[2:49:20] <%eanscrale> They were very forward with their localization efforts
[2:49:25] <GeltonZ> @Sulfur_Boride But of course
[2:49:28] <+Superbro64> finally, a real fighting game, for real people Kappa
[2:49:33] <realestjojo> Black Butler also needs the MOST context to be a spoiler
[2:49:34] <@Moobot> Hey don't yell @TheSaltminer
[2:49:35] <TimetodiveLTX> god thanks for pointing out this detail i had already forgotten about as spoilers

[2:50:10] <+Vorga1339> also not to remain stuck in the last game but got one last question, is Higarashi its own thing or does that need to be read before Umineko?

[2:50:32] <tearfuldevil> @Sulfur_Boride no, its 100% jsut pierre localized wrong
[2:50:35] <realestjojo> @vorga1339 it's mostly its own thing

[3:13:35] <GeltonZ> @TimetodiveLTX Breakers Collection is coming but not out.
[3:13:37] <%nicversus> Condor is literally just dollar store T Hawk
[3:13:46] <+jiggy_snipe> Reggie denies his Shotoness
[3:13:46] <+RollingMarbleSound> mom I want t hawk!
[3:13:54] <ShinobiPhoenix> is Rila supposed to be the Zangief? or the Blanka?
[3:13:54] <GeltonZ> @floralkami LOOKS like Super Turbo, PLAYS more like Alpha 2 which is really weird.
[3:13:54] <+RollingMarbleSound> we have t hawk at home
[3:13:56] <+TopTieramisu> i'll take she-blanka over blanka

[3:15:33] <%DSD24> I like Rila
[3:15:40] <GeltonZ> @nicversus Sho and Hanzo on top, Tia shortly after, everyone else, then Maherl and Allison at the very bottom...but everyone is darn viable as you can see.
[3:15:41] <TimetodiveLTX> yeah you find a good game in the arcade cabinet section of the major, then the guy next to you playing just tells you there's an S+ tier
[3:15:48] <TimetodiveLTX> feels bad
[3:15:49] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> Ah yes Breakers Revenge my fave game to feature in mystery tournaments
[3:15:53] <Lordbahamut780> Lol
[3:16:07] <%nicversus> BUT!
[3:16:21] <+TopTieramisu> no perfect

[3:16:45] <%nicversus> I like condor's assless chaps and loincloth combination

[3:18:37] <TimetodiveLTX> ok i realize now the spin move is supposed to be blanka electricity, but all I see is peach d-smash
[3:18:45] <@Solidus_113> the fear
[3:18:47] <SatoruMasamune> Woolie does best with the beastial character. ACT SURPRISED.
[3:18:50] <%huskarl_zap> ya fookin tosser
[3:18:56] <floralkami> ngl..... Rila could get it..... but she'd more likely take me instead
[3:19:08] <GeltonZ> @TimetodiveLTX HA! I totally see that. Move is great for buffering charges.
[3:19:17] <%nicversus> Ok I won't be mean to this game anymore it looks pretty fun
[3:19:17] <MethodiaLordae> go to horny jail
[3:19:27] <Potatoidea> They forgot the "to" on the end of this guy's name

[3:19:54] <Hoarseplay> Did anyone show Woolie the true insanity of Breakers Extra Mode?
[3:19:55] <yojohny> Spicy kitty
[3:20:00] <%nicversus> YES you can pet the dog in Breaker's Revenge... in a manner of speaking
[3:20:01] <floralkami> "can i pet the cat?" "you can TRY"
[3:20:26] <+jiggy_snipe> choked so hard
[3:20:31] <GeltonZ> @Hoarseplay I dunno if he knows yet.
[3:20:33] <%nicversus> that right there was this games "moment 37"
[3:20:40] <PlanetNixia> Sho might be one of my favorite Shoto character mizziLit
[3:20:52] <%nicversus> or the closest to a moment 37 this game could ever hope for anyway
[3:20:57] <%huskarl_zap> Sho to
[3:21:02] <TimetodiveLTX> yo he got away with it
[3:21:03] <%nicversus> I lied I'll never stop being mean to this game
[3:21:07] <whiteblacklight74> sho with the tech
[3:21:10] <GeltonZ> @nicversus Oh you don't know about Extra Mode and Loss Cancelling..
[3:21:43] <%nicversus> are you messing with me, or does this game have real tech/
[3:21:57] <lbrownthedestroyer> OH MY God i love this game
[3:21:58] <%DSD24> I like that win pose
[3:22:02] <MethodiaLordae> I wanna see Sho embrace the dark hado
[3:22:03] <floralkami> man, Ryu is such a fucking boring ass character, and i'll never get over it
[3:22:03] <%DSD24> Its pretty hype
[3:22:04] <Hoarseplay> Sho is the single best shoto character to exist. He has every tool you'd want and a few more for the hell of it.
[3:22:19] <%nicversus> Oh look it's bootleg fei long's stage
[3:22:33] <MethodiaLordae> Rila is so rad
[3:22:49] <%DSD24> Oh wow that flex
[3:22:49] <+jiggy_snipe> swole
[3:22:56] <Hoarseplay> Dao-Long is nothing like Fei outside of being Chinese.
[3:23:00] <%nicversus> The design philosophy of this game was to make the player say "oh wow just like street fighter"
[3:23:03] <GeltonZ> @nicversus Oh this game absolutely has tech. But "Extra Mode" is an interesting busted mess from the NeoGeo CD version that lets you cancel EVERYTHING. Even losing. You can cancel out of the losing knock down, get ONE MORE HIT, and if you KO your oppponent your loss becomes a draw.
[3:23:21] <MethodiaLordae> That's RAD
[3:23:32] <%nicversus> oh wait does this game have an MVS version?
[3:23:40] <GeltonZ> @nicversus Yup
[3:23:40] <%nicversus> I might buy this game
[3:23:58] <lbrownthedestroyer> Oh this game was Neo Geo CD and JP arcade that is why it wasnt successful
[3:24:12] <MethodiaLordae> as an arcade game, it's not a bad approach, build on the familiar
[3:24:19] <lbrownthedestroyer> @nicversus You buying a Japanese arcade machine Nice
[3:24:23] <MethodiaLordae> ultimate quarter stealer
[3:24:24] <%nicversus> Every fighting game was at least modestly successful in the 90s
[3:24:30] <+heyitsdenzel_> the game came out on the dreamcast in 2017
[3:24:36] <%nicversus> in Japan anyway
[3:24:37] <MethodiaLordae> huh
[3:24:56] <GeltonZ> @lbrownthedestroyer It was also made by Visco. WHO THE CRAP IS VISCO! They made mediocre puzzle games and now they make TVs. What business do they have making such a hype fighter?!
[3:25:10] <%nicversus> @lbrownthedestroyer no, just the cartridge
[3:25:17] <+FadedIgorot> metalkLurk Sup

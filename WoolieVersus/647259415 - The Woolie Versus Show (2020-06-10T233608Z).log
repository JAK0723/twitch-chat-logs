[0:05:55] <%Chatterbox1991> Chatterbox1991 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 3 month streak! KOTOR2 may have some of the most nuanced writing of any game ever; Atris might be my favorite character as an example of the worst case scenario of a Jedi Falling, being the uncompromising ideologue who falls in such a way as to be turned into a Jedi Nazi
[0:06:00] <+krispen_wa> Is this the Sonic-Jet Set Radio remix?

[0:11:29] <DatAsuna> @WoolieVersus tl;dr part 1 of that was me saying not to expect swtor to answer kotor 2 questions
[0:11:34] <wowowinsane> vrook and atris are both great
[0:11:50] <+krispen_wa> Atris is the stack overload
[0:11:52] <+Reverend_Roscoe> What did I just miss? Why is chat sad?
[0:11:54] <%spiritofmojave> @availablethor ah just V has to take off at a certain point, might be cut off an hour and 20 mind in
[0:12:01] <+Reverend_Roscoe> ok
[0:12:02] <%spiritofmojave> *mins
[0:12:18] <%Chatterbox1991> Atris is what happens when you grind for too long and become op in your idealogy
[0:12:18] <%Irridium> I went DEEP in there man
[0:12:34] <%Irridium> I went real deep
[0:12:36] <+ntfth> The Greg Bear Forerunner novels are amazing.
[0:12:37] <Tacobellx21> Good morning Woolie.
[0:12:40] <+oda_flobunaga> how about the new Shadow Warrior?
[0:12:41] <StarlitStunner> Ghosts of Onyx is the best
[0:12:48] <RamenRiderZ> KNIGHT SPEED
[0:12:53] <%spiritofmojave> PLOT PLOT PLOT!
[0:12:55] <gypsystranger> "Spirit of Fire" from Halo Wars is the best ship name
[0:13:11] <Augus7717> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[0:13:17] <AvailableThor> That's why Atris is the most realistic "fallen" character because she persists in her folly that she's the good guy, till the very end.
[0:13:25] <DatAsuna> Bao-netta
[0:13:40] <+oda_flobunaga> Bao-Dur got done dirty but... better love story than Twilight

[0:14:52] <furcifer93> How long have they been streaming?
[0:15:01] <%Binary_Fireball> since they were born
[0:15:02] <sANfouR44> Double checked and yes, hk factory does change the ending depending on the choices there, including some character fates. I'm not 100% sure if you hit the trigger for the worst one though so you might be okay.
[0:15:08] <furcifer93> Can’t be that far from last week.
[0:15:08] <%Garthunox> did they just start back up?
[0:15:20] <%shry2049> yes
[0:15:23] <%Binary_Fireball> yea they just came back from break
[0:15:25] <+FancyRamenTV> minutes ago @Garthunox , yo udidn't miss anything
[0:15:26] <+oda_flobunaga> the game would be better if you got nothing for maxing your bars out
[0:15:32] <+evbites> not wrong
[0:15:46] <%Garthunox> ok cool, got caught in a long ass apex game
[0:16:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> She hates when the force gets in the way of free will and agency
[0:16:08] <+krispen_wa> To have come so far and still understand nothing
[0:16:25] <+krispen_wa> Every light must fade...Every heart return to darkness!
[0:16:26] <%Garthunox> she hates if you use the force as a crutch
[0:16:32] <+oda_flobunaga> the mechanical design fights the message
[0:16:33] <+PlagueOfGripes> the star wars universe also punishes you for not being total dark or total light
[0:17:02] <DatAsuna> Atris is the JRPG order vs chaos villain
[0:17:04] <tranquilturnip> Atris stack overflowed into evil
[0:17:06] <Djinnazz> The 'Arthas Syndrome'
[0:17:10] <%Garthunox> Atris represents horseshoe theory to a T
[0:17:10] <+oda_flobunaga> which is why the Stick of Truth is the best Obsidian game Kappa
[0:17:12] <dinnydanny777> Apathy is Death basically means don't stand still in the middle of the road
[0:17:14] <+doc_ock_rokc> @WoolieVersus Majority of sith think this
[0:17:16] <+PlagueOfGripes> she became obsessed with power in accumulating knowledge and authority over knowledge
[0:17:38] <DatAsuna> She's the archetypal angel/god that's "good" to a fault.
[0:17:39] <+doc_ock_rokc> Horseshoe Theory
[0:17:41] <+PlagueOfGripes> an archtypical fallen / dark jedi
[0:17:45] <%Garthunox> @dinnydanny777 no it doesnt, it means you need to take action
[0:17:48] <+PlagueOfGripes> basically a weakling idiot
[0:17:51] <dinnydanny777> No but good is destroying everything I think is evil
[0:17:54] <%Chatterbox1991> Litterally Jedi Hitler
[0:17:58] <%Garthunox> doing nothing will get you killed
[0:18:22] <+oda_flobunaga> yep
[0:18:40] <silverira> from my p...
[0:18:50] <lotharrio> And explicitly trained them to never be able to feel her Red.
[0:18:50] <dinnydanny777> It's literally the point of view of destroying everything you think is evil, at some point what you think is evil might not actually be evil
[0:18:51] <+oda_flobunaga> supreme self confidence

[0:22:54] <KiddKame> I think a modern example of "Hard Blue becoming Red" is Mace Windu In Episode 3. Before finding out Palpatine wa a Sith, Windu was OPENLY planning with other Council members to FORCIBLY remove the Palpatine from office and have his Jedi "Temporarily" take over.
[0:22:54] <%alrobot2014> consummated

[0:24:09] <+krispen_wa> Two bottoms also means two tops
[0:24:21] <Dova573> So is Kreias plan is to get rid of the force and whoever survives and adapts deserve to live?
[0:24:22] <+oda_flobunaga> Bao Dur's revenge
[0:24:28] <DatAsuna> T3 is attacking the game because you didn't bring him
[0:24:31] <+krispen_wa> yeah basically that's her plan
[0:24:34] <+Estuko> @krispen_wa O
[0:24:39] <+PlagueOfGripes> that's weird. Vesas smells like she's carrying around a fresh load of meditation
[0:24:46] <+Ixek> @Estuko By bringing in a guest every now and then, if a friends relationship is anything to go off of.
[0:24:46] <snakemuho> Fight The Sith theme

[0:26:55] <%redrins> its also faster
[0:27:06] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I think getting rid of force sensitives is good for the galaxy in terms of getting rid of stupid creeds and religions but not good for the franchise in terms of entertainment value
[0:27:07] <snakemuho> it's a trophy from a Jedi he killed in his own story

[0:29:13] <$GabeSweetMan> @haitakaa You say that, but I wonder if there's an instance in Star Wars where a jedi or sith cauterizes a gapping wound to stop from bleeding out.
[0:29:20] <DatAsuna> You're good tbh, nothing requires more than 30 persuade
[0:29:24] <+SolidusRex> Are there any meaningful persuade checks left even?
[0:29:44] <+krispen_wa> You can get up to like level 32 with the natural exp
[0:29:45] <DatAsuna> @SolidusRex A few, but they're not very high checks either
[0:29:49] <+VCRUZZO> he ran out of cells, he's using the gun as a melee weapon
[0:29:59] <+VCRUZZO> unique to him
[0:30:00] <dinnydanny777> Isn't it canon that lightsabers cauterize wounds and that's why there's no blood

[1:06:19] <dinnydanny777> You know, Atton said he was supposed to be in Jedi Academy
[1:06:19] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Granny would never betray you

[1:06:32] <+metamyriad> "But HOW could Kreia be a SITH???"
[1:06:33] <GHouseduivel> You mean Liberated the Jedi Council
[1:06:40] <dinnydanny777> Why would you trust him then?
[1:06:43] <dereks0n> Same as with you
[1:06:43] <Divryne> SALTED EARTH.
[1:06:44] <+Zouledge> to be fair v she murdered vrook so it's a fair trade imo
[1:06:45] <prime_name> Living DoT
[1:06:51] <IvesNapalm> No Kreia freed the Jedi from the force
[1:06:51] <%LordSDB> Passive aoe effect
[1:06:58] <KiddKame> To quote the boys from about......80ish hours ago. "YO GRANNY WTF!"
[1:07:00] <dinnydanny777> So he melts his followers and his followers are like "yeah I'll follow you"?
[1:07:01] <petwisk> is the corrupted Blood event
[1:07:02] <%christopherwpoindexter> damn, I'll write that down
[1:07:05] <BurdRightsActivist> Nothing will ever go wrong on THAT ship
[1:07:16] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> but is it as good as a 40k ship name?
[1:07:19] <dinnydanny777> As they're melting
[1:07:23] <Doodle_Taco> devourour
[1:07:26] <%christopherwpoindexter> "my Lord"
[1:07:27] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Kriea did kill the masters to save you tho. Its really hard to fault her
[1:07:51] <DatAsuna> Note that he can't just black bolt the planet like he did katarr though
[1:07:53] <+Estuko> fun sized snickers
[1:07:54] <%christopherwpoindexter> S N A C C S U C C
[1:07:56] <%GrassCannon> Fann Y'Snakk
[1:07:57] <DatAsuna> He's actually sending troops
[1:08:03] <lotharrio> Blood Sugar is LOW
[1:08:06] <dinnydanny777> You're not you when you're hungry
[1:08:07] <%GiantPapaDoug> Damn son we actually soldiering through this final stretch
[1:08:08] <+Estuko> Visas Marrs Bar
[1:08:09] <+VCRUZZO> @DatAsuna true
[1:08:10] <tolloponik> you didn't bring appetizers?!
[1:08:13] <%MrRabbles> the Hanger is too strong
[1:08:18] <time_axis> Both were bombed to hell
[1:08:21] <penitentpentwitch> "I came here for the buffet and all that's here is a bowl of kale!?"
[1:08:28] <DatAsuna> Malak blew it up
[1:08:29] <subjectg> Telos was carth’s planet
[1:08:31] <%christopherwpoindexter> THE RACISM PLANET 💀
[1:08:31] <wowowinsane> an entire planet of racism
[1:08:32] <BurdRightsActivist> Taris ResidentSleeper
[1:08:32] <dinnydanny777> Yeah you mean Midgar
[1:08:39] <SixthSun2> Got fucking nuked when you left it
[1:08:40] <subjectg> taris is the kotor 1 planet
[1:08:40] <dinnydanny777> Planet Midgar right
[1:08:41] <+Feralspirit41> I love that description "you know the racism planet"
[1:08:41] <lotharrio> They both got bombed to the stone age.
[1:08:46] <dereks0n> The one Malak brought peace upon
[1:08:46] <+krispen_wa> Taris did survive too
[1:08:47] <petwisk> can't think on the word Snak and not think on the whiplash of Doom Eternal (danm you decino)
[1:08:49] <%alrobot2014> there are even tarisian refugees on telos as well so extra confusion
[1:08:53] <+krispen_wa> You get to see it in SWTOR
[1:08:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> When your boi gives you the good SUCC sweetc2SmugCheeks sweetc2Gasm sweetc2Shock sbfpVita
[1:08:58] <GHouseduivel> Evaporated
[1:09:00] <petwisk> Snek*
[1:09:05] <%christopherwpoindexter> I like that buzzed V seems even more blunt
[1:09:05] <+Estuko> @penitentpentwitch fuck, reminded me of when we were catered at my work and it was just a bunch of salads, first time the general manager let one of the other managers order for us. And the last.
[1:09:06] <Divryne> GLASSING.
[1:09:11] <%alrobot2014> glassing is fucked
[1:09:15] <dinnydanny777> Yeah and we ruined it for all those people under the city but then it was fine cause they all got glassed anyway
[1:09:16] <austinj24> GLASS HIM
[1:09:19] <+VCRUZZO> glass that fucking rock!
[1:09:23] <dereks0n> Same thing happened to Tattooine way back when
[1:09:26] <%Tearonex> I'm so happy V's a Halo fan
[1:09:26] <Dova573> REMEMBER REACH
[1:09:28] <coreyyotto> Is this LP just gonna transition into a Halo LP?
[1:09:29] <brachydios777> GLASSED
[1:09:33] <subjectg> Remember Harvest!
[1:09:35] <brachydios777> Remember Reach
[1:09:37] <gade177> @Estuko y salads?
[1:09:37] <DatAsuna> Fuck even I take a minute to remember that was called hosnian prime
[1:09:38] <Lefteron> @WoolieVersus From the MMO its basicly the hole thing became like the base with the ratgouls
[1:09:45] <+Estuko> @WoolieVersus Ass too fat, never run out.
[1:09:47] <+krispen_wa> Planet (nothing)
[1:09:53] <BurdRightsActivist> GIGA BRAIN
[1:09:58] <$StaceMcGate> 14 Months
[1:10:01] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Planet (Glassed)
[1:10:08] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Gotta Jebaited 'em
[1:10:09] <+Estuko> @gade177 No fucking clue, by salads I mean tomato/lettuce/ those litle crunchy thingies and some blue cheese.
[1:10:09] <Doodle_Taco> Because they were hidden
[1:10:18] <+oda_flobunaga> it is almost as if the game is poorly written Kappa
[1:10:18] <+MidnightBurst12> everybody's being a coward and hiding
[1:10:23] <GHouseduivel> Sion more like Soon-to-be-Dion
[1:10:25] <Dova573> is hungry boi Galactus?
[1:10:28] <dinnydanny777> The force is everywhere though
[1:10:29] <AvailableThor> ABOUT THAT... what if two black holes meet?
[1:10:31] <KiddKame> Giant Glass Orb (Nothing)
[1:10:43] <%Ashenik1> @oda_flobunaga dont you fucking dare
[1:10:43] <@Moobot> Get that style at tinyurl.com/castlesuperbeastshirts
[1:10:45] <%alrobot2014> who's the hungrier boy
[1:10:48] <%MrRabbles> Got them Pakks
[1:10:48] <+oda_flobunaga> Kappa
[1:10:50] <+CycloneEternalJoker> You know nothing of the power of pakk
[1:10:50] <penitentpentwitch> Force Vacuum (Light) vs Force Vacuum (Dark)
[1:10:55] <+krispen_wa> You're the Gold Experience Requiem to his King Crimson
[1:11:09] <tolloponik> Blackbeard Vs Blackbeard
[1:11:27] <%spiritofmojave> Two wounds in the force about to collide, and this jobber is convinced it'll play out standard LUL
[1:11:41] <$GabeSweetMan> oof
[1:11:47] <AvailableThor> That was a rad line.
[1:11:50] <Doodle_Taco> Fucking metal
[1:11:51] <penitentpentwitch> You are but the slightest whiff of bacon bits at this salad bar
[1:11:52] <%christopherwpoindexter> you're an ANT
[1:11:54] <+krispen_wa> Man, they're hyping him up so much and he's gonna job so hard
[1:11:57] <+Estuko> He's inside a ship but the fucker clearly still riding that dick. lol
[1:11:57] <startstoprepeat> he's beyond the concept of caring
[1:12:05] <GHouseduivel> 2 black holes about to fucking collide
[1:12:06] <%Reizie_Etherealm> It's been a while since I've last heard the Marlow Brigg's comedy show "I want nuthin' to do wit' it"
[1:12:08] <Halospaz117> He is only Hunger. Nothing else
[1:12:23] <phatmac16> he's gonna job so hard
[1:12:26] <lotharrio> Reminds me a bit of the Stargate series and Anubis. Most of the series up to that point, you have aliens with advanced technology. Over and over. Just a different advanced technology. Then Anubis shows up. And he's just MAGIC.
[1:12:29] <%HostilePoundcakes> PogChamp
[1:12:29] <+Estuko> monkaS
[1:12:33] <tuesti> Fann Y'pac is gonna take him out in one drugged up hit
[1:12:34] <%christopherwpoindexter> YEAYEYEYE
[1:12:35] <Warfey> limesS
[1:12:40] <prince_johnny_> damn
[1:12:41] <+VCRUZZO> so damn dope
[1:12:41] <+jiggy_snipe> he's doing what Sion is doing with a ship
[1:12:43] <+oda_flobunaga> he has 0 personality, like HK-50s
[1:12:44] <snakemuho> but who's doing it cooler
[1:12:48] <+oda_flobunaga> Kappa
[1:12:52] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> this is such a good hype man
[1:12:57] <austinj24> My guy is holding together an entire ship. That's pretty rad
[1:13:07] <+krispen_wa> Not only the ship, but the people in it
[1:13:08] <%christopherwpoindexter> A ship about to blow up or crumble, but it's just barely there....
[1:13:10] <Doodle_Taco> Damn he's Galactus
[1:13:16] <penitentpentwitch> "It may be a Salad bar but I'm hungry enough to stare at it."
[1:13:22] <Dova573> btw wheres crusty boi
[1:13:23] <+oda_flobunaga> dire hype man is dire
[1:13:27] <blackskulldragon18> Planet is his hunger
[1:13:34] <%christopherwpoindexter> humanity...or sentience, to use other species....
[1:13:40] <+metamyriad> pull a leia
[1:13:41] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I guess he won't mind us making ourselves at home here then
[1:13:45] <Monkeyweed21> you guys are just crumbs to him
[1:13:55] <tuesti> he would just float there
[1:13:59] <DatAsuna> He's not actually on that level
[1:14:02] <GHouseduivel> He is the physical manifestation of a black hole in a "human" body
[1:14:07] <AvailableThor> Well I'm pretty sure the bridge doesn't have windows. So he's just... holding the air in.
[1:14:18] <%MrRabbles> the most powerful case of the munchies ever seen
[1:14:19] <+SolidusRex> He is barely a being
[1:14:20] <dereks0n> It's the step from god complex to eldritch horror complex
[1:14:21] <DatAsuna> he dies if you hit him with your lightsaber
[1:14:22] <%Shinny1338> Lmao sick fear factor reference
[1:14:23] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Nihilius is just personified void
[1:14:24] <blackskulldragon18> He remind me of Mr white from TOG.
[1:14:29] <penitentpentwitch> Hunger, the strongest emotion
[1:14:31] <gade177> Is hunger an emotion?
[1:14:34] <BurdRightsActivist> If his ship blows up, he'll just Leia T-Pose force fly across the entire galaxy 4Head
[1:14:35] <tuesti> sith tummy go rumbly
[1:14:42] <tranquilturnip> I like to think that he IS Malechor V, he's the devistation of Malachor V in humanoid form
[1:14:44] <+krispen_wa> Nihilus's hype is what Abeloth should have been
[1:14:49] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> His emotions is "Oh god im so hungry, must eat"
[1:14:51] <%christopherwpoindexter> @burdrightsactivist *audible groaning*
[1:14:52] <+oda_flobunaga> ship plus ship's internal atmosphere
[1:14:53] <Monkeyweed21> he's literally a personification of hunger
[1:14:53] <lotharrio> Want is an emotion
[1:14:54] <Dangerzone979> Greed?
[1:14:56] <+DukeBlack_> lust or gluttony
[1:14:58] <prime_name> I would say so
[1:14:58] <GHouseduivel> It's a base animal instinct.
[1:14:59] <tolloponik> Hangry
[1:15:00] <Monkeyweed21> He's Necalli
[1:15:05] <%GiantPapaDoug> @blackskulldragon18 Holy shit i did not expect a TOG reference on this stream
[1:15:07] <Doodle_Taco> More like an urge
[1:15:18] <Zap_Rowsdower32> MAN TOO ANGRY TO DIE
[1:15:19] <%Chatterbox1991> Gluttony
[1:15:21] <%Irridium> you what him
[1:15:23] <Lockpickgamer> pegged him, huh?
[1:15:24] <phatmac16> pegged him, lewd?
[1:15:25] <lotharrio> More primal than an emotion, I guess.
[1:15:26] <GHouseduivel> Man to hungry to die
[1:15:32] <%mostly_simple> Hunger is an appetite, according to Plato
[1:15:35] <snakemuho> Force Users are drawn to each other
[1:15:35] <%christopherwpoindexter> @zap_rowsdower32 too *greedy to die?
[1:15:36] <Bruno_Tropical> Hunger is the Need for something, absence of something, a longing.
[1:15:38] <+krispen_wa> There's nothing to crack open. He's weaponized instinct
[1:15:39] <austinj24> He's if Necalli was cool?
[1:15:39] <%Ashenik1> you dont you just die and thats the ending
[1:15:47] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Was talking about Sion
[1:15:49] <%jinking79> Adachi
[1:15:50] <The_Nerd_Supreme> Devour-our-our-our!!
[1:15:53] <snakemuho> hey listen
[1:15:54] <blackskulldragon18> @GiantPapaDoug I found another fan
[1:16:00] <%Struggleful> Hunger is a distraction ya lazies
[1:16:03] <blackskulldragon18> it a great day
[1:16:03] <%Pillagius> cohhLUL
[1:16:06] <%spiritofmojave> HE NEVER CONSIDERED THIS
[1:16:07] <%GiantPapaDoug> Up to date baabbbyyyyy
[1:16:11] <+oda_flobunaga> where can I pay this man to hype me up?
[1:16:14] <%GiantPapaDoug> sad to see the hiatus
[1:16:16] <gade177> Man this guy's stupid.
[1:16:18] <BurdRightsActivist> HYPE MAN DEFLATED
[1:16:18] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Bruh
[1:16:19] <penitentpentwitch> Good writing, when the Player and script writers have the same thought
[1:16:20] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> This moron never thought of this?
[1:16:20] <donstylo> In the story he is powerful but in gameplay he is mostly only 2 hits.
[1:16:22] <lotharrio> "You're right... I'll go stop him!"
[1:16:22] <%GiantPapaDoug> but my man SIU needs to look after his health
[1:16:27] <+krispen_wa> Literally telling him to kill himself
[1:16:32] <%spiritofmojave> Go die
[1:16:36] <+Zanco23> He didn't think about that until now. LUL
[1:16:37] <brachydios777> No shit Sherlock
[1:16:41] <+Feralspirit41> Man remember when Tobin was like "fuck literally everyone in the galaxy that doesnt live on Onderon"
[1:16:50] <blackskulldragon18> @GiantPapaDoug Same here and yeah we can let him die on us
[1:17:06] <dereks0n> Mandalore really likes to compensate "Yeah I will kill you"
[1:17:07] <KiddKame> FOR ONDERON!! FOR CANDALORE!
[1:17:09] <%christopherwpoindexter> 2 is a good answer. INFLUENCE DOESNT MATTER NOW
[1:17:14] <lotharrio> BUT Visas is already influenced.
[1:17:18] <ZeeJiggle> This feels a bit late for influence triggers but hey
[1:17:23] <%christopherwpoindexter> 2 is very real
[1:17:28] <petwisk> something like this put the entire Universe in danger i never understand why Star Wars never put something on the universal scale
[1:17:28] <Zombrocom> Visas is kinda terrible at being a sith
[1:17:30] <+krispen_wa> She loves that big, long generosity
[1:17:45] <ZeeJiggle> lmao
[1:17:46] <@Moobot> Yes. Woolie and Little V has installed the necessary mods aka. The Restoration Mod. Now enjoy the stream

[1:18:46] <+SolidusRex> @phatmac16 Obi Wan probably came close to doing that with Ventress
[1:18:51] <+krispen_wa> I forget, did they change the difficulty back?
[1:18:54] <gade177> 2 weird 2 live. 2 rare 2 die.
[1:18:59] <+ntfth> ^^ Yes
[1:18:59] <%alrobot2014> @krispen_wa yes
[1:19:02] <%christopherwpoindexter> @petwisk which makes the lack of KOTOR 3, considering its plans, even more upsetting
[1:19:03] <Augus7717> yes they changed it back
[1:19:04] <+cubbywolf> open space lol
[1:19:17] <%GiantPapaDoug> Who would win? A literal sith Blackhole? Or one blue shining fanny pack
[1:19:21] <+krispen_wa> alright good. or else this would be more anticlamactic than it already is

[1:20:13] <%spiritofmojave> That's a fucking line
[1:20:15] <+Feralspirit41> Thats my favorite line in the whole game
[1:20:20] <+Estuko> "fuck, I wanted to die. FUCK I HAVE TO KEEP WORKING."
[1:20:20] <gade177> u don't have my permission 2 die!

[1:20:30] <Lefteron> I DIDNT HAVE PERMISSION TO DIE
[1:20:38] <+cubbywolf> big explosions
[1:20:41] <BurdRightsActivist> @BubbaRands NO.
[1:20:41] <penitentpentwitch> Still need an excuse for the level to explode after the boss dies. Rather than undramatically drift apart.
[1:20:44] <blackskulldragon18> @BubbaRands Don't do it pal
[1:20:47] <+oda_flobunaga> Its almost like this game is poorly written Kappa
[1:20:51] <AvailableThor> Also wouldn't destroying the ship do nothing since he'd jut pull it back together?
[1:20:55] <tuesti> we needed CONTENT! 14 months!
[1:20:59] <Lockpickgamer> When this ship lies in ashes, then you have my permission to die!
[1:21:01] <gade177> @oda_flobunaga REEEEEEEE!!!!
[1:21:06] <+oda_flobunaga> LUL
[1:21:06] <Dangerzone979> I mean if it's in orbit above Telos a ship crashing into the planet right now would be devastating

[1:22:42] <KiddKame> I think a modern example of "Hard Blue becoming Red" is Mace Windu In Episode 3. Before finding out Palpatine wa a Sith, Windu was OPENLY planning with other Council members to FORCIBLY remove the Palpatine from office and have his Jedi "Temporarily" take over.

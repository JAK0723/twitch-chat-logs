[0:06:05] <leviathan666303> i might see it tomorrow @gigacanuck
[0:06:07] <+Weeewer> Ive seen Godzilla
[0:06:13] <benjiFG> does godzilla do the thing
[0:06:16] <+Weeewer> Pretty decent. Too much human stuff again :/
[0:06:17] <TimetodiveLTX> random harada
[0:06:21] <%NovaKnightmare> yoyo
[0:06:24] <Jadorsonething> why is there a random pic of harada
[0:06:30] <Jadorsonething> and yet no ono
[0:06:30] <+6PoundsofShrimp> are the humans like, ok in this movie?"
[0:06:33] <%GohanEgret> harada is the lord patron saint of the stream
[0:06:42] <+Weeewer> Shin Godzilla showed that Japan should stick to the actual plot of a Godzilla film while America should double down on dumb big fights, but they're just not doing it
[0:06:45] <+6PoundsofShrimp> always put harada, Tekken is live
[0:06:57] <%VJdarkworld> I wanna watch the anno godzilla
[0:07:05] <+Weeewer> Its very good
[0:07:08] <Lewisisphat> @6PoundsofShrimp they're not great
[0:07:09] <SheefEatsBeef> shin godzilla was fucking dope
[0:07:09] <%NovaKnightmare> I want to see Legendary Godzilla vs Shin Gozilla
[0:07:12] <leviathan666303> the human stuff on shin godzilla was amazing
[0:07:14] <ShunCrone> 3 raiders from ShunCrone have joined! 
[0:07:15] <leviathan666303> in
[0:07:16] <+Weeewer> Slow and very realistic, but very good
[0:07:18] <+6PoundsofShrimp> I need to see Anno's Godzilla that's shin right?
[0:07:18] <GoldeNOVA> Watch it, Shin Goji is amazing
[0:07:20] <gigacanuck> now, I'm not going to spoil the movie but holy shit, there are some strong mythology callbacks in King of the Monsters
[0:07:20] <+Promessa_EX> shuffle your deck again woolie
[0:07:37] <%QueequegTheater> BibleThump
[0:07:44] <rempai1> i miss the squad sm
[0:07:49] <+6PoundsofShrimp> ^same
[0:07:53] <+Weeewer> So yeah in the end King of All Monsters looked beautiful and had some good action but man the human side of the conflict really was too prevalant still
[0:08:01] <%GohanEgret> \m/
[0:08:02] <+Weeewer> It would cut from the big fights every 30 seconds to focus on the humans again
[0:08:04] <+6PoundsofShrimp> @Lewisisphat that's a bummer
[0:08:06] <nobody12349> Shin Godzilla vs Legendary Godzilla would be amazing
[0:08:08] <ShunCrone> shuncrCrow We in there.
[0:08:14] <RoboBro1212> GOTTA LET IT OUT
[0:08:24] <SheefEatsBeef> GOTTA LET IT OUT GOTTA LET IT OUT
[0:08:30] <gigacanuck> @Weeewer at least this time the human conflict was more substantial
[0:08:38] <hellfirejefe> devil trigger is pulled
[0:08:46] <leviathan666303> whats woolies devil trigger
[0:09:01] <gigacanuck> and at the end, it really clears up for the action
[0:09:03] <+Weeewer> @gigacanuck yeah a bit, wasnt quite at the level it needed to be given how much time was spent imo imo
[0:09:22] <+Weeewer> It doesnt actually they cut back to the family soo much for the action :/
[0:09:24] <+Promessa_EX> woolie just glows green

[0:17:25] <gigacanuck> @ELJOVENBATALI eh, I think I'm more of an "Asian tradwife with nerdy hobbies" kind of guy
[0:17:26] <+Gespens> @ghostravens The What Makes the Sky Blue trilogy is a saga about a gay angel coming to terms with his identity and finding a spot in his life and the maini antagonist of that arc wanted to end the world so he could watch the last sunset with his boss/love

[0:26:04] <+Camail> 101 is an anime already
[0:26:05] <haveswordmuststing> @proxzo it'll animate like water
[0:26:06] <%GohanEgret> 101 is already anime
[0:26:06] <cthulhu_senpai_> D:
[0:26:07] <NeroInfinite> We don't need an anime of W101
[0:26:11] <TechTurtle7> fuck the anime give me switch port
[0:26:14] <zedravan> give it to toei LUL
[0:26:15] <@Menitta> I remember someone saying Studio Trigger should do Ace Attorney. Like....no
[0:26:16] <Twon_From_Wakanda> Yes we do. I hate the gameplay.
[0:26:18] <+Javaa01> Oh, I guess I should mention this in case it hasn't been brought up, if you're having a hard time reading the rules of a level, you should be able to get a clear readout of them if you pause the game
[0:26:18] <+Proxzo> It succeeds as a game
[0:26:20] <leviathan666303> give us w102
[0:26:23] <+EndgameContent> Woolie gets it!
[0:26:24] <Laironx3> Use Unite Guts in the playthru goddamit
[0:26:24] <KingOfTheGeats> same reason why we don't need an anime of Asura's Wrath
[0:26:26] <+Gespens> Make it a live action Tokusatsu
[0:26:29] <haveswordmuststing> put Mad House on it, thay already did Devil May Cry Kappa
[0:26:31] <$The_Cassowary> Woolie,, thoughts on Code Vein? The anime of Souls
[0:26:31] <+Proxzo> agreeeed
[0:26:37] <%ChoculaUltra> people still fuck with Trigger after Franxx?? crazy.
[0:26:42] <Laironx3> Use it more I mean
[0:26:47] <+Taglog7> maybe a new viewtiful joe
[0:26:50] <+sinistersally> Who liked the Viewtiful Joe cartoon?
[0:26:52] <@Menitta> If there's a W101 anime, it needs to have certain button prompts IN the frame
[0:26:55] <NeroInfinite> Franxx wasn't on trigger.
[0:27:04] <+Proxzo> Viewtiful joe shoe was trash
[0:27:06] <poweredscoot> A Wonderful 101 anime would have to be called Wonderful 100.
[0:27:07] <leviathan666303> @ChoculaUltra the animation in that was great
[0:27:13] <%DatAsuna> Who was to blame for franxx then?
[0:27:15] <LegendGHT> viewtiful joe was fine but yeah just make Wonderful 102
[0:27:15] <$FuqBoiSlim> there was a viewtiful joe show?
[0:27:20] <%Wool> Franxx was Abe Shinzo's plan to convince the Japanese to makes babies
[0:27:22] <+Weeewer> Just gimme switch port
[0:27:31] <ELJOVENBATALI> @fuqboislim yeah an anime. it was garbo
[0:27:33] <Floofiie> Bayonetta didn't need an anime adaptaion, but it was ok
[0:27:35] <haveswordmuststing> if i remember Trigger is seperated by The Gurren People and the NOT Gurren People
[0:27:41] <damienlunas> Persona starts at P4A
[0:27:51] <El_Desperad0> Not everything needs to be anime
[0:27:51] <+sinistersally> I think VJ cartoon was meh
[0:27:58] <GoldeNOVA> Trigger is all style and no substance
[0:28:06] <%ChoculaUltra> @leviathan666303 there's no denying it ain't pretty af, but I think the praise stops there
[0:28:12] <SheefEatsBeef> damn
[0:28:22] <+Weeewer> I havent watched the playthrough because Im really hoping to play it some day ):
[0:28:29] <leviathan666303> @ChoculaUltra A1 did the writing and the plot stuff
[0:28:31] <+Taglog7> What are we talkin about? Kappa
[0:28:34] <gustavozxd> don't remind of persona that goddamn musou game
[0:28:41] <%ChoculaUltra> crossing my fingers we get Viewtiful Joe remasters on the Switch
[0:28:48] <%GohanEgret> I think it's too visually dense for Nintendo to want to fund another shot at it
[0:28:55] <+sinistersally> I think W101 would have been like a VJ anime v2
[0:28:56] <vernardohunk93> nintendo products are too expensive in brazil for me to give a damn about W101
[0:29:03] <gustavozxd> look at dynasty warriors 9, that's the quality i'm expecting from p4s
[0:29:10] <Superbro64> things should be allowed to die

[0:42:33] <$FuqBoiSlim> That's a real bruh moment
[0:42:38] <+Weeewer> Watching Vinny playing this game and seeing his mind melt LIVE was very fun
[0:42:50] <GuelermeDias> There are some mean-ass puzzles later on.
[0:42:51] <@akuda_bar> ok i hate this one lol
[0:42:52] <ValidVenasaur> baba is win
[0:42:53] <Mendin> This is Galaxy Brain the Puzzle Game in a simple cute shell and nobody realizes it until a few levels in
[0:42:57] <%UrsulaCat> baba is stop
[0:42:58] <GuelermeDias> and by later on i mean like in world 4
[0:42:59] <LokiDeathcry> I remember having a real hard time with this one
[0:43:05] <+6PoundsofShrimp> if anyone wants to demo this game
[0:43:06] <RossMirage> BaBa is literally 『Heaven's Door』
[0:43:17] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Ass is Grass
[0:43:17] <Tisaric> The puzzle design in this is fucking perfect

[0:43:20] <%UrsulaCat> GAME IS DUM
[0:43:21] <ghostravens> BABA is JOJO?
[0:43:25] <kylejefferies> what about Baba is Baba?
[0:43:25] <QaizerArt> oh man, this one is tricky
[0:43:27] <+6PoundsofShrimp> on a website you can download the game jam version of this
[0:43:28] <Tisaric> like I have no idea how they came up with some of these puzzles
[0:43:29] <+Weeewer> Baba Is Punch Rock Paper Scissors Child in Face
[0:43:31] <Idon__> this game made me feel fucking stupid, have fun woolie
[0:43:32] <alexandrecau> so when does this game ends up being about korea
[0:43:34] <Cuke> is the sub badge a reboot icon?
[0:43:37] <GuelermeDias> baba is baba teaches you about tautologies
[0:43:38] <gigacanuck> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli and I've got the weed-whacker
[0:43:44] <+logoth_> Uncrear
[0:43:45] <Mendin> Baba is Baba is an important phrase but not at this point in the game
[0:43:45] <damienlunas> I love it when people get into the Babatalk. Why use many word when few do trick.
[0:43:47] <gustavozxd> but if baba is win, then who are you?
[0:43:47] <FrootusClopootus> This game turns into a a whole mess of "REALLY that was the answer!?"
[0:43:48] <RossMirage> You can't win if you are not you.
[0:43:53] <SixthSun2> Remember, woolie, wall is not stop
[0:44:00] <%DatAsuna> Is it possible to connect 2 "is" to one block?
[0:44:01] <kylejefferies> think in three dimensions.
[0:44:04] <cibia> 🤔
[0:44:07] <GuelermeDias> it's semantics the game

[0:44:20] <benjiFG> but at what cost...
[0:44:21] <Tisaric> Every solution is logical it just takes wrapping your head around why it's logical
[0:44:25] <+Gamefriendly> whats up chat and @WoolieVersus, just realized this was up. Does anyone know if woolie backed that DMC 5 board game?
[0:44:28] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> WINNER IS YOU

[1:12:56] <%DatAsuna> Flag could be push too if he wanted
[1:12:59] <ChineseNininga> It's fun watching woolie beat his mind goblin of overthinking things
[1:13:00] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:13:00] <Mendin> The only t hing inherently PUSH is the words that define reality
[1:13:03] <gustavozxd> @chambatron no but your idea gets something
[1:13:06] <ChineseNininga> you can do it woolie
[1:13:16] <b_ikki> yeah push is hard coded for text
[1:13:19] <nobody12349> Woolie did an overhead instead of an uppercut
[1:13:20] <+gantz_zero> !schedule
[1:13:20] <%DatAsuna> or star could be win
[1:13:20] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[1:13:33] <%UrsulaCat> white knuckle time
[1:13:34] <+Weeewer> im worried for a botch
[1:13:34] <Desaura> @fuqboislim Go back to fortnite
[1:13:34] <%DatAsuna> or wall could be win
[1:13:40] <gustavozxd> oh god
[1:13:43] <+Weeewer> Is there a spoiler chat here?
[1:13:47] <Zhwoobatte> woolie...
[1:13:51] <%DatAsuna> i can't say ".etc"?
[1:13:52] <+Weeewer> I feel like theres something obvious that would work but I dont want to say it
[1:13:56] <Mendin> This just in Woolie's galactic brain is now larger than the CN Tower
[1:14:01] <SolitaryMisan> The pillars have started to move
[1:14:02] <%DatAsuna> say it weewer
[1:14:07] <ChineseNininga> how many pillars can you push in frozen time, star platinum
[1:14:08] <+MadmanHobart> people have already said it
[1:14:08] <+skm742> I think the 'baba is you' command being on row 2 was great design on the developer's part, because it forces people to eventually realize the approach woolie is trying doesn't work
[1:14:09] <%DatAsuna> or we bulli u
[1:14:12] <Floofiie> !motivated
[1:14:12] <@Moobot> 387 USERS ARE NOW MOTIVATED!

[1:14:29] <+YabbaTroll> !motivated
[1:14:32] <hntronium> That's weird, I didn't know you were streaming Woolie, the thing on the side that tracks live followed channels wasn't showing you
[1:14:33] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Stop. GO UP INSTEAD
[1:14:34] <FunTruker> He's just doing this on the wrong order
[1:14:34] <+NoKingArthur> @WoolieVersus you don't have to be baba to win
[1:14:34] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Woolie is over think
[1:14:35] <+RazeEmAll> tdogAngery tdogAngery tdogAngery

[1:14:37] <Shastafield> woolie please
[1:14:41] <GuelermeDias> woolie just needs to make things fit his solve
[1:14:41] <alexandrecau> why can't win as pillar
[1:14:47] <+Gespens> Things can be read twice downwards!
[1:14:47] <nobody12349> Don't be an edge Lord

[1:14:52] <$eldritchbee> verticals
[1:14:52] <dukenux> woolie try to approach this from a different angle. litteraly
[1:14:53] <+6PoundsofShrimp> then push it up
[1:14:57] <gustavozxd> woolie just beat the game it's easy
[1:14:59] <Darkpajamaz> don't push. PULL
[1:15:01] <+NoKingArthur> @WoolieVersus you just have to be you
[1:15:04] <Floofiie> PULL
[1:15:04] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Then don't GO DOWN
[1:15:05] <b_ikki> he cant pull
[1:15:06] <$eldritchbee> you can be 2 things
[1:15:12] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @Floofiie that's not a fucking thing
[1:15:15] <leviathan666303> @alexandrecau win is etc is an invalid statement
[1:15:16] <JumbleJams> Baba is Up
[1:15:16] <NJigglypuff> yall dont got to try and help him in chat. if he wants help he'll ask
[1:15:17] <+stagemage> this is exactly the kind of mental crisis this game is meant to create. i love baba is you
[1:15:23] <ohnoitspooba> Can he push the flag
[1:15:25] <+spacehouse> LEVEL is RESTART
[1:15:26] <Laironx3> GivePLZ DoritosChip
[1:15:27] <$eldritchbee> Wall is Stop
[1:15:28] <DomunDomunDomun> Pull is rewind.
[1:15:29] <BreakersAweigh> there is no pull. "pull" is him undoing a move
[1:15:30] <Yomigami> this is frustrating. i cant
[1:15:30] <Apolar_> Woolie is overthink
[1:15:31] <%DatAsuna> He's not reading chat unless you wants help anyway
[1:15:31] <Floofiie> @Youwereeatenbyalid is mean
[1:15:37] <$The_Cassowary> I've thought of 3 solutions and I want to shout them but no backseating lol
[1:15:37] <%DatAsuna> he knows not to look
[1:15:38] <nobody12349> Don't literally pull
[1:15:39] <reonome> @ohnoitspooba star is degeat
[1:15:40] <b_ikki> literally everything that he can do is displayed on the screen
[1:15:43] <+6PoundsofShrimp> @NJigglypuff he said he's ignoring chat rn
[1:15:44] <reonome> defeat
[1:15:45] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @Floofiie Got that right
[1:15:46] <b_ikki> those text boxes are all the rules
[1:15:59] <nobody12349> Down is pushing, the door is labeled pull
[1:16:00] <Sebthemachinist> Oh goodness gracious, I'm afraid to keep watching. I know first-hand how torturous this game is lytWORRY
[1:16:08] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @Floofiie is Right*
[1:16:13] <iamtheTwitchghost> this game is tight
[1:16:14] <GuelermeDias> this is basically how baba works
[1:16:14] <viciousgrim> @WoolieVersus can you say what you have tried to do so far?
[1:16:16] <oSLICEo> Just delete the game. You win automatically that way.
[1:16:17] <thespoforth> I now remember why I hate watching other people play puzzle games
[1:16:18] <GuelermeDias> you overthink shit
[1:16:18] <Floofiie> @Youwereeatenbyalid is blocked :)
[1:16:19] <$FuqBoiSlim> bruh....
[1:16:20] <InkyDraconian> Woolie is overthink
[1:16:30] <BreakersAweigh> DUSTO is BITE
[1:16:37] <JumbleJams> what happens if pillar touches star?
[1:16:37] <+theAncopro> wait wat happens if pillar touch star
[1:16:42] <%GohanEgret> PILLAR is MEN
[1:16:42] <+NarcissistCactus> blocking on the internet tsosF
[1:16:43] <RiceeFTW> they explode
[1:16:49] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @Floofiie is Kettle and Black
[1:16:49] <%UrsulaCat> no
[1:16:51] <$FuqBoiSlim> piller is defeat
[1:16:52] <iamtheTwitchghost> TRASH is US
[1:16:53] <GuelermeDias> wait is the solve for this this easy
[1:16:57] <SolitaryMisan> Three is Freeze
[1:16:58] <alexandrecau> @leviathan666303 i mean if he is a pillar and touch the flag does it count or baba has to be the one touching
[1:17:02] <Mendin> If you can push Baba through the Death Star when you are not baba
[1:17:06] <cibia> baba black sheep have u any wool
[1:17:11] <b_ikki> 🤔
[1:17:11] <Laironx3> You is You
[1:17:13] <cibia> yes sir yes sir 3 bags full
[1:17:14] <gustavozxd> OVERT THINK
[1:17:16] <reonome> @alexandrecau it counts but the stars are there
[1:17:16] <leviathan666303> @alexandrecau yea but star is defeat
[1:17:18] <cibia> one for the master\
[1:17:24] <nobody12349> Don't push it "down"
[1:17:25] <%UrsulaCat> one for my master one for my dame
[1:17:25] <RiceeFTW> @alexandrecau you don't have to be BaBa to win, but if you are Pillar and Star is Defeat, then you die when you touch star as Pillar
[1:17:28] <cibia> and one for the dame
[1:17:32] <b_ikki> @alexandrecau "you" has to be the one thats touching
[1:17:39] <%UrsulaCat> one for the little boy who lives down the lane
[1:17:45] <cibia> :)
[1:17:47] <b_ikki> whatever is you at the moment
[1:17:48] <+skm742> I think he needs to replay level 2, so he remembers that BABA doesn't need to hit win
[1:17:54] <leviathan666303> @alexandrecau if he can put a pillar in there
[1:18:01] <Youwereeatenbyalid> PILLAR is PUSH on top of BABA is YOU, then push YOU up
[1:18:04] <Apolar_> so close to the solution
[1:18:12] <gigacanuck> is this one of the puzzles with multiple solutions?
[1:18:13] <GuelermeDias> stop backseating
[1:18:16] <alexandrecau> but you can push twopillars in a row one cross the stars like baba
[1:18:16] <GuelermeDias> i will ban you
[1:18:21] <FunTruker> Woolie is playing like this is the last level of the last stage and not the first stage after the tutorial
[1:18:24] <+NarcissistCactus> ban me pussy you won't
[1:18:30] <+NarcissistCactus> 😡
[1:18:30] <GuelermeDias> watch me
[1:18:31] <%UrsulaCat> I will
[1:18:31] <nobody12349> You is movable
[1:18:35] <Mendin> Woolie WHY can you push Baba through the stars?
[1:18:38] <+6PoundsofShrimp> there's another way woolie
[1:18:38] <%DatAsuna> Woolie said he won't read chat so stop worrying about it
[1:18:39] <reonome> @alexandrecau the pillars will just die at the stars
[1:18:41] <Youwereeatenbyalid> move the YOU
[1:18:49] <+AsslessChapsVEVO> this is hard to watch

[1:19:01] <nobody12349> Woolie you just need to move better
[1:19:04] <InkyDraconian> YOU is not a static object
[1:19:05] <GuelermeDias> I think he's solved it five times already
[1:19:07] <+Camail> the only thing dumber than backseating is the inability to understand that he isn't looking at chat
[1:19:07] <RiceeFTW> @Mendin YOU have to be on the flag to win, if BaBa is not YOU then you won't win
[1:19:09] <gigacanuck> Woolie will figure it out
[1:19:10] <$The_Cassowary> @reonome No they won't just like baba doesn't as long as baba is not you
[1:19:10] <%DatAsuna> You literally can't backseat unless he does the thing he said he wouldn't so just let people talk. lol
[1:19:13] <%UrsulaCat> baba is up
[1:19:18] <alexandrecau> if one pillar die all die?
[1:19:18] <Darthkitten_Prime> He has the right idea, but reversed.
[1:19:20] <+Double_Tap_That> Chat is Wrong
[1:19:23] <%DatAsuna> It's like talking at the screen, he won't hear you.

[1:21:52] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> woolie is smarter
[1:21:52] <Youwereeatenbyalid> CORRECT
[1:21:53] <gustavozxd> david cage brings people together to laugh at him, isn't that nice
[1:21:53] <%arcturusblade> That's correct
[1:21:53] <+Weeewer> What if pillars were pushed
[1:21:56] <b_ikki> the rules are on screen NotLikeThis
[1:21:57] <InkyDraconian> You is not static

[1:21:57] <gustavozxd> there's a rule you forgot
[1:21:58] <nobody12349> It's like watching someone get a jigsaw to the final piece, can't place to final piece the right way the first time, and then they restart the entire jigsaw

[1:22:00] <Youwereeatenbyalid> YOU IS MOVE
[1:22:03] <$FuqBoiSlim> Chat is Incels YouWHY YouWHY YouWHY
[1:22:03] <Laironx3> i did the exact same thing for this puzzle
[1:22:06] <Kyphen15> push YOU instead of "BABA"
[1:22:08] <%UrsulaCat> I am
[1:22:08] <maskedmustelid> Star only death to you
[1:22:12] <voyagerwitch> he figrued out confirmation bias!
[1:22:16] <kamayanna> You don't need to mess with the text that much in this
[1:22:19] <viciousgrim> Woolie vs Paige speed run yes yes i need this now
[1:22:20] <Prevot> WOOL is NotLikeThis
[1:22:21] <GuelermeDias> woolie gets something but he doesn't get it applies to other things
[1:22:24] <gustavozxd> multiple rules woolie forgot
[1:22:25] <+MadmanHobart> You need to win, not baba
[1:22:28] <reonome> woolie is overthink
[1:22:38] <beatie_g> Can you push the pillars through the stars as baba or will they explode?
[1:22:40] <+Weeewer> Pillar is not you in the start
[1:22:40] <leviathan666303> defeat only applies to things that are you @WoolieVersus
[1:22:43] <+Flambage> Baba is just the vessel not "you"
[1:22:44] <+NarcissistCactus> tsos1
[1:22:45] <InkyDraconian> you can move YOU as long as it ends up in a in a sentence
[1:22:47] <Youwereeatenbyalid> BUT WHAT IF
[1:22:56] <gigacanuck> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh
[1:22:57] <nobody12349> Woolie could of won but I don't want to just go ahead and spell it out
[1:22:57] <a_mad_dragon> @WoolieVersus best thing to do is look at every possible combination that can be made with the words you can move, you might spot something you didn't think of before
[1:23:00] <reonome> @leviathan666303 pretty sure he knows that since he pushed baba there
[1:23:03] <Cameony> Can you move the pillars inside of the stars and grab the flag as the pillars?
[1:23:16] <maskedmustelid> correct!
[1:23:18] <Cameony> well i guess that answered that lol
[1:23:19] <$cureneckbeard> WOOLIE is FIGURE
[1:23:21] <+6PoundsofShrimp> he
[1:23:29] <iamtheTwitchghost> OVER THINKING BOYS
[1:23:29] <+YabbaTroll> PILLARS is AWAKEN
[1:23:31] <+6PoundsofShrimp> He's literally moving you too
[1:23:39] <+6PoundsofShrimp> that's the worse part
[1:23:42] <%UrsulaCat> woolie moves me
[1:23:42] <gustavozxd> the rules that you forgot
[1:23:50] <%UrsulaCat> he moves me to tears
[1:23:51] <iamtheTwitchghost> e=mc²
[1:23:53] <+MadmanHobart> Your still missing something woolie
[1:23:54] <+Weeewer> Woolie there is one thing you have Never tired
[1:23:56] <sighman55> you also assumed changing the should be your first move
[1:23:56] <+Weeewer> Tried*
[1:24:00] <+6PoundsofShrimp> Woolie moves us! ;A:
[1:24:01] <$FuqBoiSlim> Cant he just move 'star' in "Star is Defeat"???
[1:24:03] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> woolie is overthink
[1:24:07] <+NarcissistCactus> powerhouse of the cell is mitochondria
[1:24:11] <Youwereeatenbyalid> *keymashing intensifies
[1:24:12] <$cureneckbeard> He can't push something in a corner
[1:24:13] <iamtheTwitchghost> just wait until he gets to later levels
[1:24:13] <GoldeNOVA> Think upside down, Woolie
[1:24:16] <b_ikki> no. you cant pull so star is stuck there
[1:24:18] <leviathan666303> woolie is over think
[1:24:19] <Darkpajamaz> could he just move "baba is you" up by one space before he really gets the puzzle going?
[1:24:20] <%UrsulaCat> moves us to drink
[1:24:23] <TwinBat> NotLikeThis
[1:24:24] <gustavozxd> woolie's playing too much dank grandpa or some shit?
[1:24:26] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @FuqBoiSlim no
[1:24:28] <maskedmustelid> wonder if 'win is pillar' is valid going down
[1:24:30] <+Weeewer> Chat Member is Drinking Pain Away
[1:24:36] <GuelermeDias> drunk is you woolie is pain
[1:24:42] <$The_Cassowary> Woolies is treating this like astrophysics when it's simple addition lol
[1:24:44] <+Weeewer> I think you need to reverse yout thinking
[1:24:47] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Oh my god
[1:24:49] <kamayanna> I mean he might actually be decent at lategame puzzles because he's treating this one like one
[1:24:50] <InkyDraconian> I need a sprite holy fuck
[1:24:51] <Youwereeatenbyalid> I think he just solved it
[1:24:53] <+Weeewer> Pillar is Push
[1:25:01] <b_ikki> but perhaps 🤔

[1:29:35] <$cureneckbeard> Woolie figured it uot
[1:29:35] <+MadmanHobart> that is a roundabout way to solve it that is gonna set him up for future failure
[1:29:36] <+RazeEmAll> CHAT is NUT
[1:29:36] <sighman55> road less travelled
[1:29:38] <FunTruker> How did he do it the hardest wat possible
[1:29:40] <Darthkitten_Prime> You did it completely backwards! You did it way harder than it needed to be
[1:29:40] <%arcturusblade> There's a way easier way to do that but hey if it works
[1:29:41] <+EndgameContent> ANTI WOOLIE PUZZLES
[1:29:41] <b_ikki> that was the HARDEST way
[1:29:41] <+Flambage> @WoolieVersus Now do it again!
[1:29:42] <+Kataguro> That was like a million times harder than it needed to be, but still
[1:29:47] <FunTruker> @WoolieVersus you are playing like this is the last stage and not the first stage after the tutorial
[1:29:49] <InkyDraconian> This game is gonna brain fuck you
[1:29:50] <ManOfReason> Anti anti anti woolie puzzle
[1:29:51] <$The_Cassowary> thank god, my blood pressure is returning to normal lol
[1:29:56] <%UrsulaCat> I am anti anti woolie
[1:29:57] <$cureneckbeard> The key is that Baba doesn't have to take the flag to win. "YOU" have to
[1:29:58] <@Moobot> Easy with the emojis @gustavozxd
[1:30:01] <b_ikki> yes they can
[1:30:02] <Kyphen15> That was when you were pillar
[1:30:03] <+Weeewer> No they dont
[1:30:03] <+skm742> <3 <3
[1:30:04] <+Javaa01> No
[1:30:05] <+YabbaTroll> ye they can if they aint you
[1:30:06] <Paul_Cheenis_Big_Beenis> No
[1:30:06] <$Ralfclogs> No
[1:30:07] <b_ikki> "defeat" applies to "you" only
[1:30:07] <startstoprepeat> defeat isn't sink
[1:30:08] <maskedmustelid> Only when you're the pillar
[1:30:08] <FunTruker> No they don't
[1:30:08] <NaderShahDidNothingWrong> Not if they're not you
[1:30:09] <+Gespens> Only if X is You
[1:30:10] <chambatron> You could have made wall is you
[1:30:10] <reonome> its fine you did it
[1:30:10] <zedravan> no they dont
[1:30:10] <anarchistPastry> the pillars only blow up if pillar is you
[1:30:10] <gustavozxd> oh my
[1:30:11] <+Flambage> @WoolieVersus Stop making up rules Woolie
[1:30:12] <+Javaa01> That's explicitly not true
[1:30:12] <Apolar_> They only blow up if they are you
[1:30:12] <Mendin> The Pillars that are YOU
[1:30:12] <+DuurHuur> Just try it woolie
[1:30:13] <+MadmanHobart> but you pushed baba through
[1:30:13] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Only if you're the pillars
[1:30:14] <%UrsulaCat> stack pillar
[1:30:14] <Bakafied> Win is pillar?
[1:30:16] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Only if it Pillar isn't you
[1:30:16] <+Kataguro> Only if Pillar Is You
[1:30:16] <+Weeewer> Pillar is NOT YOU so you can poush it through the star
[1:30:17] <viciousgrim> @WoolieVersus yes you could
[1:30:18] <%KetsuoTaberu> Defeat only kills things that are "you"
[1:30:18] <Darthkitten_Prime> They CAN get to the flag. They only blow up if they're YOU
[1:30:18] <rasamune> Things can't be DEFEATed if they are not YOU
[1:30:19] <+JustToWatch> not if pillar isn't you
[1:30:19] <WllmBrandt> defeat only works on things that are you
[1:30:19] <%UrsulaCat> STACK PILLAR
[1:30:21] <RiceeFTW> @WoolieVersus if Pillar is not YOU then it won't die when it touches DEFEAT
[1:30:22] <+6PoundsofShrimp> hahaha WOolie you're doing a good job
[1:30:24] <Vigogs> they wouldn't blow up if Pillar isn't You
[1:30:24] <gustavozxd> FORGETTING RULES
[1:30:25] <b_ikki> @WoolieVersus "defeat" applies to "you" only
[1:30:25] <Zhwoobatte> @WoolieVersus defeat and sink are not the same thing
[1:30:26] <Mendin> DEATH kills YOU, not everything
[1:30:30] <%lemuhollow> The Pillar can get to the flag, they only get destroyed when they're you
[1:30:30] <TopLeftCenter> only you can be defeated, if pillar is not you then pillar is not defeated
[1:30:30] <$Ralfclogs> defeat only works if it's you
[1:30:31] <@Commando_Joe> GUYS
[1:30:32] <%wujak> if "baba is you" then you could have pushed a line of pillars in like you did with the rocks and the skull earlier. then make "pillar is you"

[1:30:37] <anarchistPastry> @WoolieVersus The pillars only blow up if Pillar is You

[1:30:40] <+Javaa01> Inanimate objects cannot die
[1:30:41] <AMajorTom> You had a whole screen and chose to use a small area and that made it harder
[1:30:41] <steelmorrigan> You. Did. it.
[1:30:41] <Valentinius_Anodyne> DEFEAT only cancels out YOU
[1:30:42] <%DatAsuna> tl;dr the only rules are the ones literally on screen
[1:30:45] <+DappercatEsquire> believe in the you the solves the puzzles woolie
[1:30:50] <RiceeFTW> @WoolieVersus if Pillar is not YOU then it won't die when it touches DEFEAT.
[1:30:52] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @woolieversus DEFEAT is not SINK
[1:30:53] <startstoprepeat> i like this one
[1:31:02] <b_ikki> smol
[1:31:05] <+Weeewer> Woolie not listening to chat on an important lesson...
[1:31:07] <NeroInfinite> Biig
[1:31:09] <+Weeewer> Sigh
[1:31:10] <%UrsulaCat> BABA IS BIG
[1:31:14] <%DatAsuna> Every level tells you plenty to beat it
[1:31:17] <NeroInfinite> nope
[1:31:17] <Darthkitten_Prime> Sigh.
[1:31:17] <chambatron> Baba is win right?
[1:31:18] <Graxe_> It's zoomed in because this is all you need
[1:31:22] <NeroInfinite> That's how it be
[1:31:24] <%arcturusblade> I feel like "DEFEAT" throws off so many people
[1:31:25] <cibia> big baba
[1:31:26] <InkyDraconian> Baba is unit
[1:31:27] <%GohanEgret> BABA is THICC
[1:31:28] <+Kataguro> I love this one
[1:31:30] <gustavozxd> but if baba is win then who are you?
[1:31:31] <+6PoundsofShrimp> wait mod was my message bad?
[1:31:32] <@akuda_bar> baba is absolut eunit
[1:31:34] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Different levels just have different sizes, that's all
[1:31:42] <bearwagon> wait is assuming absolutes a way of thinking
[1:31:43] <+Weeewer> But if Baba Is You then whos driving the plane!?!
[1:31:46] <@akuda_bar> @6PoundsofShrimp capital letters
[1:31:51] <Mendin> Oh my god bear is driving?
[1:31:55] <@Commando_Joe> So apparently Death Stranding is gonna use the Horizon Zero Dawn engine
[1:31:56] <+6PoundsofShrimp> Ahhh I see
[1:31:58] <+Kataguro> How can that be?
[1:31:59] <Laironx3> Baba stopped thinking
[1:32:00] <GuelermeDias> this one is kinda weird
[1:32:01] <RiceeFTW> just a small level
[1:32:04] <b_ikki> it's just a small stage so it zooms in
[1:32:04] <gustavozxd> 5
[1:32:07] <+6PoundsofShrimp> Woolie needs to turn that L from Loss to Lesson
[1:32:08] <nobody12349> Size is Off putting
[1:32:08] <%DatAsuna> now he remembers he can pull words
[1:32:10] <%UrsulaCat> ah I understand how to play
[1:32:11] <@akuda_bar> @WoolieVersus the level is just small and it zooms in to compensate, it's not a trick lol
[1:32:11] <NeroInfinite> It's meant to bebig
[1:32:19] <+unclekulikov> feel the Ikaruga
[1:32:21] <Graxe_> Small levels zoom in so that it focuses on what you need
[1:32:36] <GuelermeDias> the level is small and it tries to compensate by embiggening itself, it's just like pat!
[1:32:37] <$FuqBoiSlim> Flag is you??? FrankerZ
[1:32:39] <cibia> Squid1 SeriousSloth Squid4
[1:32:45] <Mendin> @Commando_Joe The Horizon people apparently just handed Kojima the sourcecode for their engine really early on, so all KojiPro had to do is refine it a little bit and away we went
[1:32:51] <NeroInfinite> no then he'd just be in the wall

[1:38:56] <+BurningCouches> this stream is comfy
[1:38:57] <GuelermeDias> the dutch angle represents woolie being tilted
[1:38:59] <InkyDraconian> Time to do some ES PERIMENTING

[1:41:28] <+6PoundsofShrimp> he should just havdoor is still stop
[1:41:33] <fearhurst> door push
[1:41:33] <RiceeFTW> DOOR IS STOP
[1:41:34] <+Pairoschuz> DOOR is SHUT. DOOR is MADE BY THOSE WHO ARE DEAD
[1:41:36] <cibia> open sesame
[1:41:37] <hntronium> Door is push?
[1:41:38] <+Kataguro> Different kind of Open
[1:41:38] <+stagemage> open is a verb
[1:41:43] <%UrsulaCat> door is existential
[1:41:44] <ohnoitspooba> door is
[1:41:47] <iamtheTwitchghost> nice
[1:41:49] <@Menitta> DOOR IS STICK
[1:41:52] <+DuurHuur> BRAIN IS HURT
[1:41:54] <@Commando_Joe> door is key
[1:41:54] <b_ikki> maybe some
[1:41:54] <@Menitta> DOOR IS STUCK
[1:41:55] <+Kataguro> Probably
[1:42:00] <reonome> maybe
[1:42:01] <kamayanna> The dev is currently working on how to deal with translations
[1:42:01] <NeroInfinite> Probably
[1:42:01] <EliahNebb> This would work in German.
[1:42:02] <DomunDomunDomun> The way open works is gonna fuck woolie up for a while.
[1:42:03] <+d00msdaydan> baba wa kimi
[1:42:04] <Apolar_> Works in portuguese, even better actually
[1:42:04] <startstoprepeat> baka is you
[1:42:04] <+YabbaTroll> i heard they are translated it for korean at least
[1:42:05] <+BurningCouches> ive seen lots of koreans play this in english
[1:42:05] <SixthSun2> Kanji is right to left, right?
[1:42:06] <+NiktenKing> YES
[1:42:07] <leviathan666303> go to dot
[1:42:11] <@Menitta> Kiwami IS Extreme
[1:42:16] <b_ikki> it would sound a lot less charming
[1:42:22] <Parapattern> I REALLY doubt it
[1:42:23] <GuelermeDias> so, there's a thing called universal grammar
[1:42:23] <poweredscoot> LANGUAGE is FUCK
[1:42:26] <+DeaconBluesClues> you maybe can replace "is" with an arrow sign?
[1:42:31] <maskedmustelid> If it's in right to left, then you just flip the stage
[1:42:32] <%UrsulaCat> YOU IS genuine cocksucker
[1:42:33] <QaizerArt> Kiwami is Extreme is Kiryu
[1:42:34] <GuelermeDias> and syntax is universal too
[1:42:35] <+NiktenKing> You would use GA
[1:42:36] <GuelermeDias> so yeah
[1:42:36] <gustavozxd> WAluigi
[1:42:36] <hntronium> WAH
[1:42:37] <+Kataguro> Wa
[1:42:37] <+Double_Tap_That> Wario is Wah
[1:42:41] <sugewin> Waaaaaaah
[1:42:41] <+Polter_ge1st> It would be a lot less cute but yeah you can
[1:42:43] <GuelermeDias> you just change the order
[1:42:44] <%arcturusblade> The late-game keywords could be a real problem to translate
[1:42:44] <+NiktenKing> GA is the definitive NOMINATIVE
[1:42:46] <kamayanna> Worth mentioning that Japanese people are familiar enough with english words to understand most likely?
[1:42:47] <fearhurst> desu ne warr des stoppu
[1:42:51] <Shwepie> @WoolieVersus There is a reason most programming is done in English regardless of the speaker's native tongue.
[1:42:51] <SixthSun2> I guess you'd just have to look at how Japanese speakers write code
[1:42:59] <Jaxnos> kanji reads left to right, it's just the paging that is right to left

[1:47:00] <GuelermeDias> it's grammar
[1:47:03] <sppAndrews> baba is you
[1:47:05] <FrustratedAF> sorry, what's wrong with the tiles that flag is on that one does not simply walk on them
[1:47:07] <DomunDomunDomun> @jaxnos door isn't shut
[1:47:09] <RiceeFTW> no yoda rules here
[1:47:10] <GuelermeDias> subject, verb, subject complement
[1:47:11] <eanscrale> actually this would fit Japanese pretty well
[1:47:12] <+skm742> @dukenux nope, the text with backgrounds can't be the subject
[1:47:12] <+Camail> keykeke
[1:47:14] <hntronium> Can anyone in chat tell me what the rules for pushing and pulling is?
[1:47:20] <GuelermeDias> you can't have subject complement go first
[1:47:25] <%GohanEgret> @FrustratedAF flag is currently not win
[1:47:33] <+MadmanHobart> Can only push, the pulling is a rewind
[1:47:33] <FrustratedAF> oh shit :/
[1:47:34] <+skm742> @dukenux not the other way around though!
[1:47:37] <DomunDomunDomun> @hntronium There is no pulling, that's a rewind
[1:47:38] <%UrsulaCat> push key?
[1:47:41] <hntronium> Woolie if you move door to key will it opem tje door?
[1:47:44] <Jaxnos> door make shut then door open when push key?
[1:47:46] <+Darkblaze53> you can only push (except for certain specific rules), when it looks like he's pulling, he's using a rewind button
[1:47:49] <anarchistPastry> @hntronium "pulling" is an illusion, theres an undo button
[1:47:55] <gustavozxd> @Jaxnos door needs to be "shut"
[1:47:57] <hntronium> Oh, I see
[1:48:05] <cibia> lol
[1:48:13] <steelmorrigan> Key is you?

[1:49:15] <cibia> ram door into key
[1:49:16] <+BurningCouches> youd have to like it a lot frustrate
[1:49:17] <$cureneckbeard> Does pushing a door onto a key open it

[1:50:26] <+JustToWatch> GIVE HIM MORE COOL MASKS
[1:50:28] <Youwereeatenbyalid> What happened?
[1:50:31] <%GohanEgret> die hard man
[1:50:35] <Mendin> It's simple: Door became you and key became keke so door-you could make flag win
[1:50:36] <ghostravens> COMBO is CON

[1:52:42] <+BurningCouches> This game should probably convince you to QUIT programming
[1:52:52] <$Louie_Salmon> I clicked with the early levels, but oh boy it gets nuts later
[1:52:53] <%KetsuoTaberu> It's a much more fun "programming" game than, let's say, a zachtronics game LUL
[1:52:53] <Youwereeatenbyalid> The real trick is not that you enjoy it, but that you can't leave it unfinished
[1:52:54] <Graxe_> Is the top of the game feed cut off?

[1:57:34] <Mendin> Woolie try the EX level (That [.] one in the waterland
[1:57:36] <Parapattern> Honestly, we could replace the entire English language with the diction of this game and still be okay 80% of the time

[1:58:14] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @metrying oh boy oh boy. I feel like this game is building up to a sick ass Sentence you have to make to beat the game. "WORLD is SAVED" or something.
[1:58:16] <rasamune> This one is so fucking hard
[1:58:17] <%ChoculaUltra> pfff, can't believe none of you watched the Baba is You lore vids by BabaVidya Kappa

[2:00:02] <%ChoculaUltra> although this game does strike me as the kind that would actually have surprisingly deep lore somehow

[2:08:43] <lambishly> WOOLIE is STUCK
[2:08:48] <Floofiie> Brain is smooth :)
[2:08:50] <ghostravens> @grayjammer infinite rope
[2:08:53] <reonome> woolie should reset tbh
[2:08:55] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> 「Woolie」is 「Lost」
[2:08:56] <%GohanEgret> Brain is Overheating
[2:09:01] <+MadmanHobart> He needs to reset
[2:09:10] <+pkmamsters> PogChamp is Kreygasm
[2:09:13] <ghostravens> FRUSTRATION is GETTING BIGGER
[2:09:16] <$Louie_Salmon> Woolie is Defeat
[2:09:19] <@akuda_bar> woolie is crab
[2:09:20] <$cureneckbeard> Will YOU is WALL work or does YOU have to be the second word
[2:09:20] <ghostravens> DEVIL TRIGGER is PULLED
[2:09:22] <@akuda_bar> time for crab
[2:09:26] <%TheLordOfHats> woolieS
[2:09:26] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:09:34] <+pkmamsters> crab rave
[2:09:35] <$Louie_Salmon> @cureneckbeard Yeah can't start with you
[2:09:47] <hntronium> You is Crab?
[2:09:49] <Laironx3> but crab is not You
[2:09:54] <+pkmamsters> Wall is Baba
[2:09:56] <BenPooped> Why don't you pull the crab outta there?
[2:09:58] <b_ikki> what about the assumptions
[2:09:58] <Shady_Squid> crab is push
[2:10:00] <+Double_Tap_That> BABA is YOU, BABA is PUSH
[2:10:02] <$FuqBoiSlim> Crab...is a...(dolphin chirp)
[2:10:02] <$Louie_Salmon> I love the baby talk this game makes you do
[2:10:06] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Woolies brain is shutting down
[2:10:18] <+Blaxel411> rock is stop?
[2:10:21] <BenPooped> Crab is You
[2:10:26] <hntronium> If You is Crab then You is Defeat?
[2:10:38] <$Louie_Salmon> "Crab is push? Crab is push is no. Must have flag is win but crab is defeat."
[2:10:44] <+napargonaga> You can't be the first word.
[2:10:57] <+Pairoschuz> YOU wa SHOCK
[2:10:58] <hntronium> I see
[2:11:04] <zedravan> Defeat only kills You
[2:11:04] <taken_lul> @BenPooped you can't pull, there's only rewind
[2:11:12] <cibia> crab is stinky feet
[2:11:18] <BenPooped> Pull the Stop off the Wall and walk through to get the Flag.
[2:11:18] <chambatron> Pusch the rock ONCE
[2:11:22] <chambatron> Yes
[2:11:30] <Mendin> oh no
[2:11:30] <chambatron> Noooooo
[2:11:31] <Holgast> @BenPooped can't pull in this game
[2:11:32] <+skm742> @taken_lul for now, that is correct. Later that changes
[2:11:36] <BenPooped> @taken_lul Oh I see.
[2:11:59] <Holgast> when he's 'pulling' it's just undoing the push
[2:12:00] <%HDmexiqtioner> Hey Woolie, what's up mang? Just sent you info.
[2:12:00] <patrickIy> Can't wait until Woolie complete's this puzzle and goes "OHHHHHHHH!!!" :P
[2:12:02] <SolitaryMisan> Sticks to snakes
[2:12:04] <%HDmexiqtioner> Hey chat
[2:12:06] <ghostravens> ROCK is DRAGON
[2:12:09] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> ???
[2:12:12] <Holgast> LuL
[2:12:16] <+carp_> WALL IS YOU
[2:12:17] <Floofiie> ;)
[2:12:17] <Zhwoobatte> good job
[2:12:17] <Intolerable> Can you pull apart WALL IS STOP?
[2:12:19] <BenPooped> So when it looks like he's pulling, he's actually rewinding previous actions?
[2:12:22] <Holgast> yes
[2:12:24] <grayjammer> Dope.
[2:12:27] <$Louie_Salmon> A big part of this game is moving things around to keep them in usable positions because you might need it later
[2:12:28] <b_ikki> you cant pull
[2:12:38] <+napargonaga> @Intolerable Nope, you can't pull.
[2:12:47] <%DedlokPM> @Intolerable you can only push. anything that looks like a pull is him rewinding
[2:12:50] <b_ikki> when it looks like hes pulling he's just undoing his actions
[2:12:51] <BenPooped> This game should be called You Can't Pull
[2:12:54] <SlyphOfMind> You can pull, but only when Pull is involved
[2:12:58] <reonome> NO
[2:13:03] <chambatron> Noooooooo
[2:13:16] <reonome> woolie is assume LUL
[2:13:17] <+campasino> crab is you and push
[2:13:17] <chambatron> No :(
[2:13:20] <BestTeaMaker> Woolie you are so close
[2:13:20] <Intolerable> OK never played this so don't know mechanics
[2:13:22] <$Louie_Salmon> I know some people came back to this after finishing several other worlds, it's pretty tricky
[2:13:26] <Mendin> Call Paige
[2:13:26] <BenPooped> Then it should be called You Can't Pull Until Later
[2:13:27] <FrustratedAF> wall is push????
[2:13:29] <ChineseNininga> Is it mandatory tho
[2:13:31] <ChineseNininga> is it tho
[2:13:35] <chambatron> Yes
[2:13:58] <Cameony> the dude that said this game is like a "1% of people can't" whatever ad is 1000% correct because watching people play this game is frustrating as shit lol
[2:13:59] <%gatorafan> Internet is Trash
[2:14:01] <taken_lul> he doesn't have to puch crab does he?
[2:14:03] <kuningaz45> Woolie is Win
[2:14:07] <@Solidus_113> brain is melt
[2:14:08] <Mendin> why does he keep becoming the wall
[2:14:11] <SlyphOfMind> Game Is Hard
[2:14:11] <%gatorafan> I'll have to check the VODs later . _.
[2:14:12] <Mendin> woolie plz
[2:14:14] <Shady_Squid> baba is crab?
[2:14:16] <hntronium> Hey Woolie can you make Baba is Push?
[2:14:18] <kuningaz45> puzzle is defeat
[2:14:18] <Holgast> honestly it's funny to just try everything like that
[2:14:31] <reonome> woolie stop making crab is defeat
[2:14:31] <+Double_Tap_That> He's assuming that just touching the crabs will kill him, when in reality it's going onto their space
[2:14:31] <$Louie_Salmon> @cameony If you beat this level you're legally a master
[2:14:33] <hntronium> Does pushing Baba into Crab then count as defeat?
[2:14:35] <cibia> rock smash crab
[2:14:37] <zedravan> @ChineseNininga no this is a bonus level
[2:14:37] <XxZulaxX> Push the rock towards the 2 crabs. And once it touches the flag make rock is you
[2:14:41] <RoboXGP> IS IS
[2:14:46] <$cureneckbeard> Defeat only affects You, not necessarily Baba
[2:14:50] <metalwater8> Why can’t he pull the word crab?
[2:14:51] <$Louie_Salmon> I love how the world just ends when nothing is you
[2:14:52] <@Menitta> there is no spoon
[2:15:05] <Cameony> there is no pull
[2:15:14] <%UrsulaCat> there is no crab
[2:15:26] <+carp_> can you make wall is push
[2:15:27] <barucafe> only push and rewind
[2:15:31] <Rosy_Joan> when he pulls thats just a redo buttpn to rewind
[2:15:37] <maskedmustelid> HAIR is PULL
[2:15:40] <+senoue> Can you walk into crab with 2 baba?
[2:15:41] <@Solidus_113> craaaaaab
[2:15:42] <+BurningCouches> reset
[2:15:44] <metalwater8> Oh okay thanks
[2:15:45] <fearhurst> edge undo undo undo
[2:15:45] <Prevot> the real baba is the friends we made along the way
[2:15:46] <Bakafied> I think i got it, but i won't backseat
[2:15:46] <@Menitta> CRAB IS RAVE
[2:15:47] <BestTeaMaker> CRAB
[2:15:47] <hntronium> So if Rock is You and Baba is Push can you Push Baba over Crab?
[2:15:47] <+mister_rogers> baba is crab?
[2:15:49] <TwinBat> crab is battle
[2:15:53] <cibia> 2 crab walk into a bar
[2:15:54] <+pkmamsters> crab is stop
[2:15:55] <Forgottenblade_> baba is crab
[2:15:56] <+Double_Tap_That> Crab is Rave
[2:15:56] <$cureneckbeard> KNIFE is BROKE
[2:15:57] <%UrsulaCat> hair is pull please punch dad
[2:15:57] <taken_lul> HAIR is PULL indeed
[2:15:59] <Floofiie> @Bakafied You can backseat he's not looking at chat
[2:16:01] <a_mad_dragon> crab is peench
[2:16:02] <+C1ic> can you move push?
[2:16:04] <reonome> people keep thinking there is pull NotLikeThis
[2:16:10] <+pkmamsters> Baba is Win
[2:16:10] <Bakafied> But I'll feel bad!
[2:16:10] <Cameony> back seat all you want, someone said he isn't looking at chat so he doesn't get spoiled
[2:16:12] <+marumariball> HEAD is HURT
[2:16:14] <SlyphOfMind> Chat Is Sad
[2:16:16] <+Buka_Zero> this is all because he never really figured out thew star is defeat map
[2:16:16] <Floofiie> touche
[2:16:17] <b_ikki> it is
[2:16:19] <Holgast> good point @hntronium can you push the TEXT Baba over the crab
[2:16:20] <a_mad_dragon> pull is later
[2:16:20] <$Louie_Salmon> @bakafied You can also whisper me and I'll let you know
[2:16:22] <MrLittleSam> This is an interesting idae for a game.
[2:16:25] <@Solidus_113> this is an EX mission
[2:16:25] <metalwater8> Could he reset then put the push before the crab?
[2:16:26] <XxZulaxX> words and rock can go through the crabs
[2:16:27] <Prevot> PUZZLE is DIFFICULT
[2:16:28] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[2:16:30] <%UrsulaCat> eh
[2:16:31] <Laironx3> Woolie's public enemy #1 CRAB
[2:16:31] <FrustratedAF> its tricky to rock and rhyme :/
[2:16:31] <BenPooped> This game is an adaptation of that video Randy Pitchford posted.
[2:16:32] <%HDmexiqtioner> Is there anything stopping you from pulling the word Crab?
[2:16:34] <Red_Ace_Black_Jack> MIND is FUKD
[2:16:34] <+skm742> @senoue That will delete both baba. Defeat destroys all 'you' objects that move into it
[2:16:34] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Still on this one? Yeah, it's a real tough one
[2:16:37] <reonome> WOOLIE READ CHAT
[2:16:38] <dukenux> Guy is One
[2:16:43] <$Louie_Salmon> Yeah some people just haven't played
[2:16:44] <%DedlokPM> ANY TIME YOU SEE A "PULL" IT IS A REWIND
[2:16:46] <chambatron> You have to put the rock on the flag and then becaome the rock

[2:17:11] <nobody12349> woolie is also assuming that he should push rock into crab immediately
[2:17:15] <poweredscoot> The visual effects should have reversed too
[2:17:17] <+ktothec99> I struggled with this level... but that also describes every level in this game
[2:17:19] <Red_Ace_Black_Jack> Thanks chat
[2:17:19] <+PenmanLupine> I see the answer now
[2:17:19] <metalwater8> Yeah didn’t know sorry

[2:17:23] <Red_Ace_Black_Jack> zyzxLmao zyzxLmao zyzxLmao
[2:17:24] <taken_lul> Pull should be a stand

[2:42:41] <+Plankman> Wool is Smart
[2:42:56] <worldbrand> Woolie is Figuring
[2:42:56] <+skm742> It's ok that woolie is cheat, because chat is dumb
[2:43:07] <NukeDaHippies> BABA IS ROCK?
[2:43:14] <+イベル> There's something funny about listening to someone play Baba. The thoughts of a Baba player sound like the ramblings of a madman without context.
[2:43:16] <%fatal_penguin_> Woolie used PUSH
[2:43:23] <Mendin> Understand the Concept of SINK
[2:43:25] <noodlerush> hey
[2:43:29] <GoldeNOVA> I just realized, this is Woolie Will Figure It Out LIVE Kappa
[2:43:37] <+Valison> CHAT is HERRING and RED
[2:43:40] <+Plankman> Woolie is sink
[2:43:41] <someyounguy1> or if rock is you and you is push can you bring win over?
[2:43:44] <NukeDaHippies> If you do Baba is rock, won't you float??
[2:43:45] <%UrsulaCat> alright I'm bout to head out
[2:44:03] <MrLittleSam> Peace
[2:44:03] <someyounguy1> sames ursula cat
[2:44:06] <someyounguy1> ciao all.
[2:44:10] <ghostravens> @UrsulaCat take care!
[2:44:12] <+skm742> @NukeDaHippies Yeah, but then he can't touch the flag
[2:44:16] <reonome> push the win over
[2:44:25] <fearhurst> despite being only 13 percent of you
[2:44:31] <+MrLily> text is not float?
[2:44:42] <worldbrand> Woolie is Best
[2:44:42] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:44:48] <Malik1002> What if BaBa is rock
[2:44:49] <dee388> this is stange
[2:44:50] <%HDmexiqtioner> !uptime
[2:44:50] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 2 hours and 44 minutes
[2:44:57] <dee388> strange*
[2:45:08] <Malik1002> then Baba can float
[2:45:09] <arkv01> BaBa needs daiper change now
[2:45:16] <+PeaceCentennial> baba push
[2:45:16] <XxZulaxX> Or you know, push win away from flag
[2:45:32] <worldbrand> Do you?
[2:45:37] <OtterSlinger> @XxZulaxX Water is Sink though
[2:45:49] <+MrLily> ROCK is WIN?
[2:45:56] <%HDmexiqtioner> Winter Is Coming
[2:46:00] <%HDmexiqtioner> ohh wait
[2:46:15] <+skm742> @MrLily rock is float, can't touch baba
[2:46:27] <%fatal_penguin_> Winter is Cumming
[2:46:43] <Mendin> Woolie is missing/forgetting a fundamental aspect of reality
[2:46:44] <+skm742> @MrLily but your thought process would provide clues
[2:46:45] <NumbusPlays> rock can still touch text, right?
[2:46:49] <worldbrand> Gun is Jump
[2:46:57] <dee388> push rock first?
[2:47:06] <arkv01> BaBa is working in Montreal construction
[2:47:11] <+skm742> There's the clues!
[2:47:13] <+PeaceCentennial> WORDS THAT KILL
[2:47:16] <Mendin> And there we go
[2:47:20] <worldbrand> Woolie is Figuring!
[2:47:23] <+MrLily> FLAG IS in water?
[2:47:31] <grayjammer> WORDSTHAT KILL
[2:47:33] <fearhurst> kill push and is
[2:47:35] <gustavozxd> just watching this game made me super tired holy shit i'm going to sleep
[2:47:36] <XxZulaxX> Oh. Text to water and make a bridge
[2:47:44] <ChineseNininga> WORDS THAT KILL
[2:47:55] <FrustratedAF> can't get the WIN over water?
[2:48:04] <fearhurst> win sinks
[2:48:05] <+MrLily> push PUSH in water
[2:48:07] <patrickIy> Last level had Text is float and you had to move the rocks to destroy the water. Now it's Rock is Float. SeemsGood
[2:48:13] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Just push some words in, SMH
[2:48:29] <%DedlokPM> @FrustratedAF any word that is not floating will sink as soon as it hits the water
[2:48:32] <poweredscoot> words can die
[2:48:32] <coltdemont> I just want woolie to figure it out, but the way he thinks its his worst enemy
[2:48:37] <NukeDaHippies> Maybe if you make Baba a rock and the rock you then you push baba over
[2:48:37] <damienlunas> This is still just the beginning. This game goes to a level complexity and difficulty I never would have expected from a puzzle game being sold today.
[2:48:43] <nobody12349> Let the bunny die
[2:48:53] <the_sprankton> you can beat the game without seeing like half of it
[2:48:57] <+PenmanLupine> oh dang. I see it
[2:49:22] <arkv01> BaBa is live road showing
[2:49:23] <+PenmanLupine> rock is you, let baba die, go back to baba is you, make 2 babas, let another baba die win
[2:49:24] <deafmutelaughing> @coltdemont that seems to be the intention with this game
[2:49:39] <worldbrand> A bit messy
[2:49:46] <worldbrand> But it works
[2:49:52] <b_ikki> it doesnt
[2:49:57] <dee388> cant touch rocks
[2:49:59] <b_ikki> rock is float
[2:50:00] <worldbrand> oh right rock is float
[2:50:08] <+PeaceCentennial> Baba is Win should work?
[2:50:12] <+MrLily> push PUSH left one then win
[2:50:19] <+skm742> @PenmanLupine you can't end up making 2 babas with that plan, you can't make 'baba is rock'
[2:50:23] <NukeDaHippies> baba is win Kappa
[2:50:28] <b_ikki> baba isnt related to the win condition NotLikeThis
[2:50:28] <+PeaceCentennial> just move push somewhere
[2:50:33] <b_ikki> just you
[2:50:34] <vernardohunk93> why not just push ROCK and PUSH into water?
[2:50:38] <NumbusPlays> yeah
[2:50:40] <reonome> baba can only be one thing in this level
[2:50:42] <worldbrand> Baba can't be win and you here... however...
[2:50:44] <b_ikki> "you" has to win, baba is just another prop
[2:50:47] <arkv01> BaBa is just an insignificant mortal :(
[2:50:58] <reonome> @vernardohunk93 rock floats
[2:51:00] <patrickIy> @vernardohunk93 Ya that's the solution. Woolie just hasn't figured it out.
[2:51:03] <+PeaceCentennial> baba is win
[2:51:10] <maskedmustelid> ROCK beats SCISSORS
[2:51:10] <+PeaceCentennial> or you is win?
[2:51:13] <dee388> baba is you is win?
[2:51:21] <arkv01> raise your flag BaBa
[2:51:24] <OtterSlinger> Verbs can't be the start of sentences
[2:51:24] <GoldeNOVA> Does it? Kappa
[2:51:25] <vernardohunk93> @reonome the word rock, not the obejct
[2:51:36] <reonome> oooh ok
[2:51:40] <@Solidus_113> flag is trick
[2:51:44] <dee388> or push the rocks down before making you is rock?
[2:51:44] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[2:51:46] <NJigglypuff> baba is you is win is not a legal rule
[2:51:47] <worldbrand> Woolie was Close
[2:51:50] <steelmorrigan> Rock is Win?
[2:51:52] <SpaceGuntank> this game will for sure fry your brain at one point
[2:51:53] <arkv01> flag is hole in one
[2:51:54] <nobody12349> Flag is a fake ass bitch
[2:51:55] <fearhurst> keyword is bridge
[2:52:00] <b_ikki> you had half of the right idea
[2:52:03] <NickHatesSnow> Baba is Win?
[2:52:04] <zedravan> words are not float
[2:52:04] <reonome> @NJigglypuff it is a legal rule, you just can't do it in this level
[2:52:05] <NukeDaHippies> Why can't you push your text into the river??
[2:52:08] <MrLittleSam> Brain is hurt
[2:52:10] <GoldeNOVA> You only need win from the other side
[2:52:13] <zargy> not a very good shot if I do say so myself
[2:52:27] <Red_Ace_Black_Jack> ALL YOU NEED IS WIN
[2:52:28] <+PenmanLupine> oh wow yeah. I think its as easy as that
[2:52:29] <+napargonaga> Now what?
[2:52:32] <arkv01> woolie needs Monster Energy Drink™
[2:52:34] <dee388> or maybe destroy rock on river?
[2:52:35] <$RilsRislan> what about killing the words on the left
[2:52:38] <OtterSlinger> We all float down here
[2:52:40] <dee388> rock word i mean
[2:52:42] <b_ikki> cant destroy rock, rock floats
[2:52:46] <InkyDraconian> I see solution
[2:52:51] <damienlunas> Can he just do rock is you, rock is win?
[2:52:54] <NukeDaHippies> So if you push rock and is into the river, wouldn't that work? lol
[2:52:54] <fearhurst> Woolie needs the new Monster Protein Energy
[2:52:57] <arkv01> everyone has a number... even BaBa
[2:52:58] <NJigglypuff> @reonome i mean as one straight rule. you can make 2 different rules that equate to the same
[2:52:58] <reonome> destroy rock text
[2:53:00] <communistjk> Rock and push in water?
[2:53:04] <b_ikki> does he have it
[2:53:07] <+PenmanLupine> push the words rock and push into the water
[2:53:07] <$RilsRislan> I think he could push Rock and In into the the water
[2:53:07] <worldbrand> PogChamp
[2:53:07] <+napargonaga> Rock is Pointless?
[2:53:09] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @communistjk you are correct
[2:53:12] <b_ikki> he has it
[2:53:12] <InkyDraconian> YEE
[2:53:13] <deafmutelaughing> HOW
[2:53:13] <$RilsRislan> oh hey
[2:53:15] <reonome> that works
[2:53:18] <dee388> oh dang
[2:53:23] <+napargonaga> Huh, that works.
[2:53:23] <patrickIy> Woolie does the hardest way possible LUL
[2:53:26] <zargy> AHHHHGGGGGG
[2:53:31] <+PenmanLupine> or that
[2:53:31] <nobody12349> finally
[2:53:34] <+PenmanLupine> lol
[2:53:36] <Mendin> @patrickIy Therein lies the genius of Baba is You
[2:53:36] <vernardohunk93> i dont think you could do it harder
[2:53:43] <Danndy_Guy_in_Space> GAME is GOOD
[2:53:44] <XxZulaxX> Not intended but eh it works
[2:53:44] <ohnoitspooba> that works I guess
[2:53:46] <b_ikki> oh this one was annoying
[2:53:50] <SelfMaidMan> i feel like that shouldn't have worked
[2:53:51] <b_ikki> finnicky
[2:53:52] <arkv01> @patrickIy its the best way for streaming purposes BloodTrail
[2:53:52] <Mendin> Hey look there's the spinning cogs
[2:53:56] <gigacanuck> meanwhile Stef is lying in bed desperately trying to figure out what fiendish puzzles Woolie is tackling
[2:54:08] <切捨御免> OMEGALUL

[2:54:16] <b_ikki> waterwaterwater
[2:54:17] <%DedlokPM> Could have also: used words from left side to push into the water. Or pushed "Rock is you" up and then pushed "Win" over to "Baba is"
[2:54:19] <Mendin> Oh MY GOD
[2:54:20] <TigerFlavoredCereal> WIN is DED
[2:54:24] <dee388> oooo
[2:54:24] <+skm742> eye is open
[2:54:28] <NukeDaHippies> Winner is dead
[2:54:30] <zargy> I didn't know you could do that
[2:54:37] <OtterSlinger> Text Must Float, Spice Must Flow
[2:54:38] <damienlunas> I think I see it
[2:54:43] <nobody12349> Solution is Simple
[2:54:49] <%fatal_penguin_> MORTIS is YOU
[2:54:51] <%DedlokPM> I see it too
[2:54:55] <arkv01> GRRM is Push
[2:54:58] <worldbrand> There we go

[2:55:45] <+PeaceCentennial> KEKE IS DEFEAT
[2:55:49] <worldbrand> You're not wrong, but some of them are the only hints this game can give
[2:55:51] <NJigglypuff> @nukedahippies a good idea, but you cant walk onto text (it has a built in push rule)
[2:55:51] <the_sprankton> I remember this level being awful.

[2:58:34] <gigacanuck> Frustration is getting bigger
[2:58:36] <ghostravens> ARCANA HEART is DOWNLOADED
[2:59:07] <Mendin> Oh I think I see but that's a bit of finesse
[2:59:08] <@Moobot> Saturday nights for Woolie VS Videogames, Tuesday nights for Get Into Fighting Games
[2:59:19] <切捨御免> fuck you keke
[2:59:20] <damienlunas> I don't see it at all
[2:59:22] <SelfMaidMan> DEVIL TRIGGER is PULL
[2:59:30] <gigacanuck> Woolie, my man
[2:59:32] <InsomniacPersona> I think I see the answer
[2:59:37] <gigacanuck> you are not even looking in the right place
[2:59:45] <maskedmustelid> URSAIN is BOLT
[2:59:48] <%fatal_penguin_> Projared is Defeat
[3:00:00] <worldbrand> i really dont think ive seen this level and i've cleared most of the game
[3:00:01] <dee388> granblue is cygames, cygames is money
[3:00:06] <seylumiue> Woolie is crash
[3:00:08] <+napargonaga> Cool, I think I see it.
[3:00:12] <damienlunas> Waaait I think I might see it
[3:00:47] <NukeDaHippies> John Travolta Is Bolt
[3:00:48] <mayorrev> brain is confused
[3:00:51] <maskedmustelid> skill is move?
[3:00:54] <maskedmustelid> *skull
[3:01:02] <切捨御免> Baba is Hot 🤔
[3:01:07] <gigacanuck> Woolie needs to try these earlier in the day when his brain is sharper
[3:01:11] <deafmutelaughing> bwaaaaa is you
[3:01:16] <dee388> skull is push?
[3:01:19] <patrickIy> Woolie almost has it.
[3:01:24] <$cureneckbeard> ! SUNDOWNING !
[3:01:29] <nobody12349> You could solve it without bolt
[3:01:42] <CheekyBirb> y'all, you can't skull is move or push with defeat in the way
[3:01:44] <NukeDaHippies> I think you need to make skull move
[3:01:44] <%fatal_penguin_> BIBLEBLACK is CLUB
[3:01:51] <NJigglypuff> can you? i think you need bolt
[3:01:57] <InsomniacPersona> RACE is WAR
[3:01:57] <切捨御免> !WOOLIE AT RISK!
[3:02:08] <arkv01> woolie is DEVIL TRIGGERING
[3:02:09] <mayorrev> BRAIN IS STOP
[3:02:10] <deafmutelaughing> no wait if it's not push can't you push defeat there and ignore the bolt?
[3:02:11] <%Chichen> WOOLIE IS RISK
[3:02:13] <+plasticduck963> Brain is Defeat
[3:02:16] <ghostravens> WOOLIE is RISK
[3:02:19] <+napargonaga> Sentence is move?
[3:02:22] <MrLittleSam> Woolie is Broken
[3:02:25] <poweredscoot> Woolie is fry
[3:02:39] <seylumiue> Time is cube
[3:02:43] <Red_Ace_Black_Jack> WATASHI GA KITA
[3:02:44] <nobody12349> 2 paths to win
[3:02:51] <SilverJakler> Earth is Flat
[3:02:58] <NukeDaHippies> Darlington Is Crush
[3:03:09] <$cureneckbeard> Woolie will figure it out
[3:03:14] <%fatal_penguin_> Danearys is Defeat
[3:03:14] <SelfMaidMan> can't you just pull the win block out?
[3:03:15] <NJigglypuff> lol
[3:03:15] <haveswordmuststing> @poweredscoot baked?
[3:03:17] <gigacanuck> Woolie is Crash
[3:03:33] <pibbleton> Time Cube is Race War
[3:03:35] <Parapattern> Maybe make it so the bolt doesn't push things?
[3:03:46] <haveswordmuststing> @gigacanuck FBBlock [NOT]
[3:03:49] <NJigglypuff> pulling is not a thing
[3:03:51] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> can another word go instead of defeat?
[3:03:59] <OtterSlinger> Pulling is him pressing undo
[3:03:59] <%DedlokPM> @Parapattern you need the bolt to push something to win
[3:04:01] <TopLeftCenter> @SelfMaidMan You can't pull blocks, only push them. When it looks like he's pulling stuff he's undoing previous moves
[3:04:02] <+MagickBurritoh> are hot and defeat the same thing?
[3:04:08] <dee388> god DAMNIT KEKE
[3:04:09] <InsomniacPersona> put move or push behind defeat?
[3:04:21] <gigacanuck> kekekekekeke
[3:04:22] <worldbrand> He'd have to get Defeat out first
[3:04:25] <ireliaismaiwaifu> 2 paths one choice
[3:04:31] <InsomniacPersona> @MagickBurritoh no hot melts bolt but not kill baba
[3:04:31] <%DedlokPM> It's just a manner of what and the timing of it/where you are when you push it
[3:04:32] <gigacanuck> all according to KEKEiaku
[3:04:33] <mayorrev> WOOLIE IS WALL
[3:04:35] <NJigglypuff> nooooo
[3:04:41] <NukeDaHippies> What happens if you make defeat move?
[3:04:42] <%DedlokPM> Want a hint?
[3:04:43] <A_Cat_in_a_Bat> keke has slain us
[3:04:43] <TigerFlavoredCereal> Maybe use puch in the defeat corridor?
[3:04:44] <@Solidus_113> Katana is Zero?
[3:04:45] <vernardohunk93> just do it at the same time
[3:04:45] <poweredscoot> Woolie is wall is stop
[3:04:48] <$FuqBoiSlim> woolie is given up
[3:04:48] <%Chichen> LIMIT IS BREAK
[3:04:49] <NickHatesSnow> Oh I see it
[3:04:50] <TigerFlavoredCereal> Push*
[3:04:50] <切捨御免> Keke really is defeat
[3:04:50] <SilverJakler> Wall is in fact Stop
[3:04:51] <Parapattern> Woolie IS stumped
[3:04:57] <maskedmustelid> PARTY is HARD
[3:04:58] <FrustratedAF> what's up with A for Wait?
[3:05:01] <NJigglypuff> have you played this dedlok?
[3:05:02] <Red_Ace_Black_Jack> Killer is Dead?
[3:05:02] <+skm742> @WoolieVersus If you're stuck on a level, feel free to try another one!
[3:05:03] <MrLittleSam> Keke is Raid Boss
[3:05:03] <+napargonaga> What is the stage named?
[3:05:04] <dee388> do words go through keke?
[3:05:09] <vernardohunk93> you dont need to get in front of defeat
[3:05:09] <DomunDomunDomun> Race the bolt.
[3:05:16] <%DedlokPM> @NJigglypuff no but I can see the answer
[3:05:19] <nobody12349> Walk down to go to the win
[3:05:23] <TechTurtle7> doodStare
[3:05:24] <NJigglypuff> ah, k
[3:05:31] <切捨御免> oooooooh
[3:05:32] <切捨御免> okay
[3:05:33] <NukeDaHippies> What if....Bolt is defeat and move??
[3:05:52] <$RilsRislan> no and
[3:06:03] <NukeDaHippies> Do you lose? Or does it destroy everything?
[3:06:12] <+PeaceCentennial> baba is fuck
[3:06:13] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[3:06:13] <vernardohunk93> teamwork is bolt
[3:06:17] <Niney_Who> Woolie Is Mindflood
[3:06:22] <Shastafield> BIG resets
[3:06:28] <worldbrand> Catch is 22
[3:06:31] <ireliaismaiwaifu> "there's nothing you can do to win"
[3:06:37] <nobody12349> Woolie please
[3:06:39] <SixthSun2> We can't see the top of the screen, btw @WoolieVersus
[3:06:40] <+kknutson4> what can the bolt melt?
[3:06:45] <dee388> can words go through keke?
[3:07:05] <nobody12349> There is another way towards win
[3:07:06] <InkyDraconian> time your movements
[3:07:07] <worldbrand> the bolt doesn't melt other things, the bolt gets melted if it touches something hot
[3:07:09] <vernardohunk93> what does the A do?
[3:07:11] <NickHatesSnow> Can you pull defeat out?
[3:07:11] <+napargonaga> @kknutson4 nothing, the bolt itself melts if it hits something hot.
[3:07:13] <steelmorrigan> What if bolt wasn't push?
[3:07:18] <NukeDaHippies> What will happen to Bolt if it's defeat? you die or does it destroy things?
[3:07:18] <steelmorrigan> and was move?
[3:07:21] <InsomniacPersona> @vernardohunk93 it undos a move
[3:07:23] <panic_rabbit> oh I get it
[3:07:29] <%DedlokPM> @kknutson4 nothing. The Bolt Melts when it touches something Hot
[3:07:40] <+napargonaga> Oh?
[3:07:46] <DomunDomunDomun> hot destroys melt, defeat destroys you
[3:07:57] <worldbrand> But you're out of words
[3:08:01] <ireliaismaiwaifu> fail
[3:08:03] <+napargonaga> Almost
[3:08:04] <+kknutson4> k
[3:08:06] <TigerFlavoredCereal> THAT'S a good idea
[3:08:08] <InsomniacPersona> Almost
[3:08:14] <+Aztec50> apatHoldon apatHoldon
[3:08:15] <TigerFlavoredCereal> You're almost there!!!!
[3:08:18] <%DedlokPM> He got there in a different fashion than I was thinking but he had the same idea. teenYEY
[3:08:18] <SilverJakler> Defeat is Win
[3:08:19] <patrickIy> ALMOST Woolie PogChamp
[3:08:20] <dee388> keke IS FUCK
[3:08:25] <切捨御免> sacrifice words to get more time on the clock
[3:08:26] <nobody12349> You could already walk through the skulls
[3:08:37] <+pkmamsters> baba is hot
[3:08:45] <nobody12349> You did what you could have earlier
[3:08:57] <InsomniacPersona> you need push next to move
[3:08:58] <dee388> thats progress though
[3:09:00] <DomunDomunDomun> bolt must win
[3:09:20] <$FuqBoiSlim> Elmo came with that ak47
[3:09:50] <+Bowiie> Oh I think I see it
[3:09:54] <worldbrand> Did you?
[3:10:01] <+Bowiie> He was super close earlier
[3:10:03] <+HyraFukit> Woolie big thinks
[3:10:42] <worldbrand> Question is Good
[3:10:48] <NukeDaHippies> Can he push all the words to keep bolt alive?
[3:11:11] <vernardohunk93> bolt is race
[3:11:12] <Nyckelus> Getting closer!
[3:11:23] <%ChoculaUltra> he's tasting it
[3:11:31] <CheekyBirb> i can taste it too
[3:11:39] <+HyraFukit> Woolie is Think
[3:12:20] <worldbrand> botl is vertical
[3:12:36] <%DedlokPM> it blows up because bolt is hot and bolt is melt. because the melt thing "touched" a hot thing
[3:12:45] <dee388> bolt is nalt son
[3:12:59] <worldbrand> He's so close hot damn
[3:13:15] <patrickIy> Yes Woolie YOUR SO CLOSE PogChamp
[3:13:15] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:13:24] <InsomniacPersona> BOLT is WIN Pog
[3:13:34] <SelfMaidMan> !uptime
[3:13:35] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 13 minutes
[3:13:41] <%Chichen> ya fucked it
[3:13:42] <+Bowiie> Does bolt keep moving even if Baba isn't you?
[3:13:46] <Nyckelus> Very close now! He’s almost there!
[3:13:46] <worldbrand> yes
[3:13:52] <patrickIy> You just gotta change one thing and that's it.
[3:14:15] <+waltzqueen> what level is this?
[3:14:29] <worldbrand> Brain is Bend
[3:14:38] <+PeaceCentennial> win
[3:14:55] <arkv01> sk c
[3:14:56] <worldbrand> for posterity: if an object is Defeat and Win, touching it will make you lose
[3:15:02] <切捨御免> HOLD ON HOLD ON
[3:15:03] <arkv01> wind is pushing you
[3:15:05] <+HyraFukit> So, I actually got around to the kirby lore videos. Shit was dope.
[3:15:07] <+linSP> BIG hold on
[3:15:30] <%DedlokPM> apatBig apatHoldon
[3:15:35] <dee388> OH
[3:15:41] <worldbrand> hahaha
[3:15:42] <dee388> i think it clicked for me
[3:15:51] <dee388> puuuush
[3:15:54] <+Nekheny> triHmm
[3:16:09] <Hammatime8> I think I have an idea. I can hold it, though.
[3:16:13] <Nyckelus> Woolie’s making it a bit more complicated than need be.
[3:16:16] <%DedlokPM> He's got the fundementals. Just needs to work on the execution.
[3:16:20] <$RilsRislan> Push push
[3:16:28] <worldbrand> You have the right idea but made a bad assumption
[3:16:31] <CheekyBirb> LUL
[3:16:33] <+BurningCouches> does bolt is move have to be there
[3:16:42] <+PeaceCentennial> I don't think it does
[3:16:47] <patrickIy> No @BurningCouches it doesn't LUL
[3:16:48] <CheekyBirb> idk, i think you're missing a piece
[3:16:50] <+PeaceCentennial> it can just be the bolt
[3:16:54] <$RilsRislan> Move something else down the top hole
[3:17:09] <Klarrann3> win needs to connect to something
[3:17:11] <Hammatime8> I think he's trying to avoid reading chat to avoid spoilers.
[3:17:12] <vernardohunk93> he could just have push stacked on the bolt and race to the win
[3:17:14] <worldbrand> LUL
[3:17:17] <InkyDraconian> what else can the bolt push
[3:17:19] <vernardohunk93> its so simple
[3:17:25] <+waltzqueen> IKR baba is you is great but also pain
[3:17:33] <mayorrev> BRAIN is STOP
[3:17:45] <worldbrand> It's SUCH a leap
[3:17:46] <ck1755> move bolt down to push you and in into "bolt is"
[3:17:49] <+Bowiie> The turning gears is real good
[3:17:50] <+BurningCouches> i play this game ten minutes at a time lol
[3:17:51] <dee388> i dont wanna give it away now but woole need help
[3:17:58] <gigacanuck> aaaaahhhhhh
[3:17:58] <Niney_Who> Win is defeat
[3:17:59] <%DedlokPM> The bolt could also push nothing.
[3:18:00] <+PeaceCentennial> nah don't help him
[3:18:03] <CheekyBirb> LUL
[3:18:04] <dee388> ye
[3:18:09] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @ck1755 I don't think it would work.
[3:18:09] <haveswordmuststing> if theres control prompts its a tutorial Kappa
[3:18:10] <gigacanuck> AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH
[3:18:18] <poweredscoot> all you have to do is make you win though
[3:18:18] <Nyckelus> You got this Woolie! Just keep thinking about it.
[3:18:21] <worldbrand> ahahahahahaha
[3:18:23] <CheekyBirb> fun
[3:18:25] <+PeaceCentennial> does iT?
[3:18:26] <%DedlokPM> woolieDATTEBAYO
[3:18:33] <worldbrand> i think he's driving us more nuts than the game is driving him nuts
[3:18:34] <patrickIy> Brain is Big
[3:18:39] <$RilsRislan> Do you need to move the sentence?
[3:18:42] <+PeaceCentennial> woolie is brain
[3:18:48] <TigerFlavoredCereal> No Wowee
[3:18:51] <Tabonline> woolie is close
[3:18:53] <Zombrocom> Pretty sure woolie isn't reading chat so you cant give it away
[3:18:53] <Bakafied> OOOH I GET IT
[3:18:55] <Mattcowdisease6> this is the def. of insanity
[3:18:57] <vernardohunk93> woolie is overthink
[3:19:01] <$RilsRislan> So close
[3:19:03] <Mallaes> MIND is BLOWN
[3:19:08] <%DedlokPM> there is 3 things out of place
[3:19:16] <worldbrand> he's so sure
[3:19:17] <haveswordmuststing> Woolie is well known for overthinking things to the point he gets it completly wrong Kappa
[3:19:17] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Wait, what if the bolt just pushed "PUSH"
[3:19:19] <wwylele> LUL I have seen many people pushing BOLT IS MOVE into the tunnel
[3:19:20] <CheekyBirb> I'M LOSING MY SHIT
[3:19:26] <dee388> poosh
[3:19:38] <vernardohunk93> @Youwereeatenbyalid thats what he needs to do
[3:19:41] <$RilsRislan> I think the bolt is move thing is a common step to learning about the race
[3:19:49] <Hammatime8> He's gonna have to reset this one.
[3:19:51] <@Menitta> keke is bitch
[3:19:57] <Buzzard42> WOOLIE IS PUZZLED
[3:19:57] <dee388> keke is trifling

[3:20:55] <worldbrand> you know i thought i wanted to see paige play this but now i don't think i would survive
[3:20:57] <leargo> you are making this too hard
[3:21:01] <Zombrocom> Woolie has overthought pretty much every puzzle

[3:59:52] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @woolieversus stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 4 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 16oz (480mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[4:00:04] <RiceeFTW> you can attack mid roll
[4:00:09] <+crimsonharvest> SIMPLER
[4:00:15] <%DatLatinoGuy> t-thanks bot
[4:00:18] <thunderhog> i cant purchase the game if i already own it
[4:00:25] <+thesw1tch> seriously this shit does look fun as fuck
[4:00:38] <RiceeFTW> it's as satisfying as it looks, yes
[4:00:42] <gigacanuck> samurai is weak to bullet
[4:00:47] <Tomikozi> You gotta start gifting the game to everyone you can now.
[4:00:53] <Tomikozi> Never stop drugging.
[4:00:57] <%DatLatinoGuy> this game helped for that Hotline Miami itch
[4:01:00] <televisedrevolting> We getting to level 8 tonight boys aka THE BEST LEVEL IN THE GAME?
[4:01:17] <ghostravens> @televisedrevolting is level 8 the bunker?
[4:01:18] <+thesw1tch> @tomikozi it's probably illegal to stop the drugging
[4:01:29] <eddiemayfly> I wanna see wollie get to the movie studio.
[4:01:30] <televisedrevolting> @ghostravens 8 is 15
[4:01:36] <thunderhog> i was never a big fan of hotline miami, but thats more cause i like my platformers than my top down shooters
[4:01:48] <Tomikozi> @thesw1tch I think 99% of what you do in this game isn't exactly... "legal"...
[4:01:48] <ghostravens> @televisedrevolting oh shit you're fucking right
[4:01:49] <thunderhog> this is the hotline miami i needed in my life
[4:02:11] <Nalesh> Couldn't he just kill the gunner on the right then retreat and go in from the left?
[4:02:22] <pibbleton> Well shit, I'm convinced and buying it.
[4:02:24] <LTKonnor> Almost
[4:02:25] <spacecatstreams> i just knocked a plate with ketchup onto my pants BibleThump

[4:03:59] <ghostravens> man, this game needs a scenario creator
[4:04:07] <televisedrevolting> Just lame it out like Cross Tekken. But with like... lasers.
[4:04:28] <spacecatstreams> its also fun to turn the lasers backon when they run into that room
[4:04:28] <+thesw1tch> lezzgo
[4:04:31] <LTKonnor> gg
[4:04:39] <RiceeFTW> you can cancel your rolls into attacks, it's hggOd strong
[4:04:44] <televisedrevolting> Could've just lamed it out with the lasers.
[4:04:54] <+Emperor_Bad> for realwhat were those guys in the laser room doing
[4:04:54] <televisedrevolting> But that's lame.
[4:05:15] <zeepyrus> TALK TO HIM THO
[4:05:16] <ghostravens> now talk to him
[4:05:18] <LTKonnor> yeet
[4:05:18] <Sparty9112> talk to him anyways
[4:05:26] <spacecatstreams> damn
[4:05:26] <%DatLatinoGuy> yeeeettt
[4:05:27] <Smart_ZaK1> I feel like having a laser room in your secret hideout is just asking for a bad time
[4:05:37] <+MagickBurritoh> wtf
[4:05:41] <ghostravens> plot happens! yeah!
[4:05:45] <%Dr00_PhD> Jebaited
[4:05:47] <Tomikozi> Big plot.
[4:05:50] <%DatLatinoGuy> yeyeyey you're right Woolie
[4:05:50] <pibbleton> I am purchasing the video game so I will find out.
[4:05:55] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Hell yeah, play the game you cowards
[4:05:55] <ghostravens> now reenact the club scene from john wick 1!
[4:05:57] <Ion_Laser> riffKappa
[4:06:04] <deafmutelaughing> just came in, did he talk to the DJ or no
[4:06:05] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> "If you wanna know what happens you should just read the manga" - Woolie Kamiyama @WoolieVersus
[4:06:05] <%jinking79> i'm loving this
[4:06:12] <%Dr00_PhD> No talk
[4:06:13] <thunderhog> not gonna lie i killed him first run so i REALLY need to not kill him next time
[4:06:17] <Nalesh> Is that why you die so much this time around Kappa
[4:06:18] <%DatLatinoGuy> killed the DJ
[4:06:23] <deafmutelaughing> nice
[4:06:28] <gslayer14> fun fact: theres a continuity error of you kill electrohead this early
[4:06:29] <+Aztec50> Please support the official release
[4:06:34] <RiceeFTW> max range PogChamp
[4:06:37] <Thirtine> Cool that’s there’s a bit of branching paths, makes for interesting lore
[4:06:41] <gslayer14> i'll explain when he gets back to the therapist
[4:06:43] <Tomikozi> @deafmutelaughing Does slicing the man's head into 2 pieces before he can finish a sentence count as talking?
[4:06:50] <+Aztec50> from woolie abridged
[4:06:53] <deafmutelaughing> it does not!
[4:06:53] <captain_stimpy> yooooo katana zero for sure sleeper hit of the year
[4:06:54] <RiceeFTW> there is most definitely a no-slomo option
[4:06:54] <spacecatstreams> theres a boss fight in this game i missed entirely apparently
[4:06:55] <+JustToWatch> @WoolieVersus I tweeted you a clip of you sneaking and dancing
[4:07:00] <%DatLatinoGuy> yeah you can totally play this game without the slowdown
[4:07:07] <%DatLatinoGuy> just need better timing tho
[4:07:10] <RiceeFTW> @spacecatstreams yes, he is pretty cool
[4:07:22] <+jkobe34> hey @WoolieVersus do you know about the secret boss?
[4:07:23] <CirclesForever> the sprite art is nice in this game
[4:07:33] <LTKonnor> NO BULLY
[4:07:35] <+crimsonharvest> That's awesome
[4:07:37] <Tomikozi> Using Slow-Mo counts as normal time in Speed Run Mode.
[4:07:38] <CirclesForever> the animations are also nice
[4:07:39] <Tomikozi> Git gud.
[4:07:41] <%ChoculaUltra> Katana Zero's on sale on the Nintendo eShop rn btw.
[4:07:48] <deafmutelaughing> why are you so rude to her
[4:07:54] <thunderhog> slo mo just basicly gives you better frame imput time. if your a speed runer you got your inputs on point
[4:08:09] <a_mad_dragon> ziz gets no love
[4:08:41] <spacecatstreams> how does the speedrun mode handle these scenes?
[4:08:43] <gslayer14> simurgh best endbringer fight me
[4:08:50] <RiceeFTW> it skips it
[4:08:57] <RiceeFTW> it skips dialogue and cinematics that aren't "action"
[4:09:02] <Thirtine> @spacecatstreams you can just turn them off completely
[4:09:09] <televisedrevolting> I hate how attached I became to this tiny being.
[4:09:11] <SixthSun2> That red was concerning
[4:09:19] <+griffball13> @WoolieVersus do you know about the secret boss
[4:09:36] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> why do you have a loli sidekick?
[4:09:36] <CirclesForever> leviathan is a fish with a big mouth
[4:09:45] <QaizerArt> BE NICE-A TO DA CHIIILD
[4:09:48] <%jinking79> letting little girl in your house to bad it not 1960 anymore can't use that card to get out of jail
[4:09:53] <runningfleet> this kid has good taste in names
[4:09:53] <+crimsonharvest> i hope she has more toys named after Satan

[4:13:44] <QaizerArt> YEAAAAH, THIS LEVEL
[4:13:55] <spacecatstreams> i never bothered with the stealth
[4:13:56] <+griffball13> remember snake this is a stealth mission
[4:13:56] <FrustratedAF> kill everyone loud, got it
[4:14:05] <gslayer14> is this level actually possible to stealth?
[4:14:08] <RiceeFTW> yes
[4:14:13] <gslayer14> really
[4:14:15] <gslayer14> huh
[4:14:15] <QaizerArt> @gslayer14 Yeah. Just tough as fuck.
[4:14:16] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Kill them all, Woolie
[4:14:16] <Thirtine> Oh yeah, let’s start going OFF THE RAILS
[4:14:18] <QaizerArt> I've done it.
[4:14:19] <%DatLatinoGuy> I actually managed to stealth it all the way, frustrating as fuck tho
[4:14:34] <RiceeFTW> 100% yes and it is even crucial to the story
[4:14:35] <QaizerArt> You get a sick reward for stealthing it 100%, no kills.
[4:14:39] <ghostravens> time to get silent hill as fuck boys!
[4:14:39] <spacecatstreams> apparently the new update "fixed" the stealth level
[4:14:40] <Ion_Laser> Well shit...
[4:14:44] <spacecatstreams> according to justins twitter
[4:14:51] <gslayer14> i was too weak then
[4:14:51] <+griffball13> game over man game over
[4:14:55] <Parapattern> The extra amount of effort to hang a dude after killing him
[4:14:57] <LTKonnor> This isn't going according to Keikaku at all
[4:15:00] <mayorrev> marioooo
[4:15:05] <+cyclonova> they're already dead? damn, you're good

[4:15:23] <FrustratedAF> monkaS
[4:15:24] <Valentinius_Anodyne> TETSUO
[4:15:24] <spacecatstreams> this must be the work of some kind of dragon
[4:15:26] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> oh hes dead
[4:15:31] <zeepyrus> IT'S A TRAP
[4:15:39] <gslayer14> wow the dragon is really strong
[4:15:42] <%DatLatinoGuy> KILL THEM ALL
[4:15:46] <Thirtine> Oh shit
[4:15:47] <CirclesForever> is the plot twist that this is a drug induced hallucination
[4:15:50] <spacecatstreams> ope its murder time
[4:15:58] <deafmutelaughing> apparently you don't have to kill any of the cops here but I couldn't do it
[4:15:58] <+OverlordAshwader> SourPls
[4:16:01] <RiceeFTW> @CirclesForever no
[4:16:03] <+arancet> trying to stealth this level is what made me stop playing the game, it got so annoying
[4:16:05] <HawkGoggles2> The stealth run feels like something that was expected to do on the second playthrough.
[4:16:13] <Thirtine> @circlesforever nah that’s lame
[4:16:13] <Smart_ZaK1> You really tried it
[4:16:23] <spacecatstreams> @Quikanims no but the biker fight is coming
[4:16:26] <LTKonnor> What kind of masochist would try to stealth this level
[4:16:36] <HawkGoggles2> Me.
[4:16:37] <RiceeFTW> you actually unlock something for doing so
[4:16:53] <%DatLatinoGuy> yeyye it's frustrating but possible
[4:16:58] <+spacehouse> Aww, no secret boss i guess
[4:17:09] <CirclesForever> gucci gang
[4:17:14] <sunny_side_up> it only took me like 20 attempts to stealth it 4Head
[4:17:16] <mayorrev> there's a secret boss?
[4:17:22] <correctedsun117> We are not pleased
[4:17:22] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[4:17:28] <%DatLatinoGuy> took me an hour to stealth it
[4:17:31] <+griffball13> wanna know how to unlock it
[4:17:33] <+spacehouse> aww
[4:17:40] <ghostravens> oh fuck this part
[4:17:47] <RiceeFTW> it's too convoluted to unlock it first playthrough on accident
[4:17:52] <eddiemayfly> I can tell you that most other streamers I've watched play this game tried to stealth this level and gave up about 10 minutes in.
[4:18:14] <HawkGoggles2> But here's the deal, the secret item you get for this level is dependent on your actions before hand. You either get by stealthing it or killing everyone.
[4:18:14] <+griffball13> @WoolieVersus be rude to your psychiatrist at every oppertunity and don't do what he says
[4:18:20] <RiceeFTW> @WoolieVersus you already missed it, you had to have pissed off the receptionist at the hotel and talk to Electrohead
[4:18:29] <+haseoseerlane> I'm pretty sure you just have to say fuck you every chance you talk to the psych
[4:18:29] <%DatLatinoGuy> buy this game and it's on sale atm too!!!
[4:18:30] <%ChoculaUltra> its 12 bucks on the Nintendo eShop rn if ya'll got switches.
[4:18:30] <+Emperor_Bad> this game is dope on all fronts
[4:18:31] <spacecatstreams> katana zero briefly filled the hotline miami shaped hole in my soul
[4:18:39] <deafmutelaughing> I lost interest in this game but I'm glad I bought it
[4:18:48] <+filthydrongo> is this on the switch?
[4:18:49] <+spacehouse> Antagonize the therapist in prologue, don't kill DJ, interrupt therapist
[4:18:52] <%Akanesasusora> you don't need to kill the receptionist. you just need to make your psychiatrist super pissed
[4:19:04] <%johnny_gogo> Yeah im playing through hard right now
[4:19:09] <runningfleet> you have to fuck up every mission
[4:19:14] <%johnny_gogo> its WAY harder
[4:19:18] <+griffball13> @WoolieVersus basicly make a scene at every opertunity
[4:19:19] <correctedsun117> Everyone's been recommending this game to me. Looks dope.
[4:19:21] <+spacehouse> receptionist kill not required
[4:19:22] <%ChoculaUltra> damn, cromag is strong.
[4:19:24] <runningfleet> and never talk to the psych
[4:19:30] <Thirtine> Yeah it’s pretty complicated to get the secret boss
[4:19:31] <spacecatstreams> you can kill the receptionist?
[4:19:32] <spacecatstreams> wow
[4:19:34] <+MagickBurritoh> RACE WAR
[4:19:39] <+griffball13> @WoolieVersus you can do it through chapter select if you want so no big

[4:20:33] <+haseoseerlane> Be a jerk and indulge in self interests against the pyschs orders then?
[4:20:35] <+MagickBurritoh> you have to shit on the therapist
[4:20:37] <QaizerArt> @WoolieVersus Hang up and demand medicine, Pissed off receptionist, talk to Electrohead, refuse meds, kill all officers, tell psych FUCK YOU, if you get told "I’m almost disappointed that you’re still alive, after what you’ve put me through." by the psych, the final psych session will have the boss fight.
[4:20:44] <@Menitta> @filthydrongo Switch/PC.
[4:20:44] <startstoprepeat> yeah i've beat the game twice and i thought the hobo was a guaranteed kill
[4:20:46] <%DatLatinoGuy> Switch and PC
[4:20:53] <+filthydrongo> yoooooo heck yeah
[4:20:58] <HawkGoggles2> @johnny_gogo I'm pretty sure if you kill him one, you will always kill the hobo.
[4:21:03] <runningfleet> this scene is not ok
[4:21:11] <ghostravens> this scene fucked me up badly
[4:21:29] <%DatLatinoGuy> yeah this scene is rough
[4:21:29] <LTKonnor> chiki chiki~
[4:21:32] <sunny_side_up> at least the music is good LUL
[4:21:33] <%DatLatinoGuy> not good times
[4:21:38] <Thirtine> Yeah this part is fucked in a true-to-this kind of game way

[4:22:20] <%johnny_gogo> God i love this game
[4:22:29] <%DatLatinoGuy> this game is trippy as fuck
[4:22:41] <Thirtine> @menitta yep! Dynamic text!
[4:22:42] <eddiemayfly> This whole snuff tape thing felt inapproriately appropriate for a cyberpunk game.
[4:22:46] <@Menitta> Dank
[4:22:50] <Shastafield> LUL
[4:22:58] <@Menitta> Wait is the plot of this game like Dredd 2013
[4:23:01] <%johnny_gogo> it appeals to my edgy side alot
[4:23:03] <Ion_Laser> WutFace
[4:23:05] <correctedsun117> Those sound effects...
[4:23:09] <eddiemayfly> And the sound design is so fucking good too.

[4:24:06] <%Man_of_cupS> Man_of_cupS subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[4:24:07] <correctedsun117> When the world is gray, the bad guys have to be black as night
[4:24:08] <eddiemayfly> "that's pretty fucked" If I couldn't guess you've played the game already I'd be laughing.
[4:24:11] <ghostravens> the bad guys are hyper evil
[4:24:11] <@Menitta> these cutscenes are really high quality for 2D sprites
[4:24:13] <+Xeno351> so everyone is basically a shit got it
[4:24:15] <+Ariksgabs> Bad guys are Bad
[4:24:16] <wakeuplvl3> "are we the baddies"
[4:24:22] <+linSP> just because you are bad guy does not mean you are bad guy
[4:24:27] <Thirtine> And even mr katana zero himself thinks that’s fucked up

[0:21:32] <+tearknack> @WoolieVersus jade empire is jank, but its about fighting styles, and its shortish
[0:21:34] <+PanicSwytch> Standard
[0:21:47] <Teyaric> It's Kung Fu stuff where you punch kitsune and have great characters

[0:36:51] <%Solidnick18> nice
[0:36:59] <rubbishbinge> d e m o n w a l l
[0:37:12] <heartlesshealer> it's a mental thing
[0:37:31] <heartlesshealer> oh they're talking about for this game, not Minh
[0:37:55] <%StaceMcGate> can anyone explain what Woolie is talking about with "not using the gun to upgrade it"
[0:38:17] <Teyaric> Have AR Equipped - pick up another AR while FULL on ammo will level it up
[0:38:19] <heartlesshealer> They only upgrade if you pick up the same weapon while you're full on ammo for it
[0:38:33] <%Prevot> I almost always hate enemy scaling
[0:38:34] <%Irridium> @StaceMcGate Basically, to upgrade a gun you gotta pick up the same gun when you have full ammo for it already. Which leads you to not using the gun to keep it at full ammo to maximize upgrades
[0:38:55] <%StaceMcGate> that sounds awful, like FF8 junction system levels of awful
[0:39:06] <+sir_louis> Put level die in everything
[0:39:08] <+D00msDayDan> Is anyone counting how many times woolie says at the end of the day?
[0:39:20] <MattDemers> At the beginning of the night
[0:39:33] <am_omega> Nah the Junction system is not awful when you actually sit down to learn it.
[0:39:41] <%Prevot> @d00msdaydan so we can know how many times he. said it at the end of the day?
[0:39:56] <Lazaflame> nah fam junction is good the 2nd time you play
[0:39:59] <oniwahoo> Like you do less damage in a fighting game by comboing?
[0:40:03] <%FuqBoiSlim> at the end of the day let's agree to disagree
[0:40:04] <%Javaa01> If you want active scaling like that, it has to work both ways
[0:40:13] <heartlesshealer> Which one was Junction, the summons or the Draw combat mechanic?
[0:40:24] <%StaceMcGate> @am_omega it discourages you from using magic. If you use magic, stats go DOWN
[0:40:41] <oniwahoo> Challenge 4 and 6 are rough
[0:40:52] <am_omega> Yeah but guess what, if you used the Junction system right you don't even need to use magic.
[0:41:33] <%StaceMcGate> but then you're just using the attack command over and over. It's super easy to cheese the game I know, but that's not what I want
[0:41:55] <am_omega> FF8 literally hands you a gameshark in the form of Junction.

[1:00:10] <%FuqBoiSlim> is that why woolie sounded disappointed when people told him the pistol in doom is trash?
[1:00:23] <SainEdge> @StaceMcGate i think all the characters in this game are lame, much weaker than all other platinum games. Gameplay is still great tho
[1:00:37] <+detbasil> Minh is a coward for not using the pistol confirmed
[1:00:54] <townzzzzz> minh don't care
[1:01:03] <SoaringLettuce> @fuqboislim im always mad when pistols suck, thats why i love the pistol from halo
[1:01:03] <%Javaa01> Or more specifically, every headshot is a kill
[1:01:03] <%StaceMcGate> Yeah, they trying to emulate western action heroes a tad too hard.

[1:13:41] <%Javaa01> The back weakpoint isn't done yet BTW
[1:13:56] <biomegabear> @rubberduckymega I like the image of dark souls leg sliding around at high speeds
[1:14:23] <%Javaa01> Nah, the back is on 1 HP, you can only destroy it fully once it's standing up
[1:14:25] <rubberduckymega> this is dark souls just with jetpacks and guns
[1:14:33] <%Javaa01> So no trophy for you

[1:17:02] <%FuqBoiSlim> it's actually better

[1:19:21] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1229464161366794241?s=19
[1:19:30] <%Javaa01> Doom 93' that is
[1:19:34] <+nawji> that sounds similar in concept to shit like strafing in old shooters
[1:22:07] <%Javaa01> It's basically Artemis
[1:22:35] <This_is_Marco> aimbot pistol PogChamp
[1:22:50] <%Javaa01> It's like a 9th of the screen
[1:22:54] <%Javaa01> As a box in the middle
[1:24:13] <%GraceTBM> slomo in this game is like, the opposite of DMC turbo mode
[1:24:16] <%Javaa01> The problem with the Smart Pistol was just that you COULD beat out people who had to be aiming precisely because you could dedicate all your attention to dodging and moving unpredictably
[1:24:40] <Tiewolf> This looks like a mix of Kamen Rider and and that COD game where you run on walls
[1:24:40] <%Solidnick18> that's pretty good
[1:25:14] <Tiewolf> can you rider Kick?
[1:25:17] <%GraceTBM> wtf was that move
[1:25:47] <artoflec> that backhand can parry any melee attack too
[1:25:48] <Tiewolf> Please tell me if you can rider Kick
[1:26:17] <%GraceTBM> either i missed a bunch of tutorials when i played this, or the game doesn't do a very good job of telling you about your tools
[1:26:29] <%netrac> no it does not
[1:26:29] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[1:26:34] <Daxalog> Those floating things were real!?
[1:26:40] <%Javaa01> The soviet union cooked all sorts of kooky and lethal stuff, problem was, all that stuff was mostly just lethal to the person operating it
[1:26:58] <Tiewolf> D O A R I D E R K I C K
[1:27:13] <Daxalog> Yeah, when I played I wasnt doing 3/4ths of the stuff here. The only thing I knew about was collecting the same wep to upgrade it
[1:27:17] <%GraceTBM> i think platinum games are super cool to watch and they're crazy stylish, but i never really feel like i've gotten a good grasp on the controls and mechanics
[1:27:26] <arikk42> Shinji Mikami: There are no repeating levels
[1:27:29] <xdeathknightx> @GraceTBM Woolie basically turned into Pat with Minh and gave him all the tech
[1:27:48] <%GraceTBM> wait, minh is playing? that's a cool twist
[1:28:06] <+jetjagger222> btw melee attacks with the disc are free
[1:28:14] <%Javaa01> I think he might be above
[1:28:23] <%GraceTBM> I'll have to pick up all the tech from the start of the lp to actually give this game a shot
[1:28:48] <%GraceTBM> i literally never used the melee cause i didn't know about that disc melee and the standard kills all your fancy mechanics
[1:28:48] <Tiewolf> anyone in chat, can you do a rider Kick in this game
[1:28:54] <Tiewolf> I must know
[1:29:06] <arikk42> @WoolieVersus how much money do i need to give Wonderful 101 ?
[1:29:27] <Ether101_Prime> Does anyone else have opinions on the weapon upgrade system?
[1:29:41] <%GraceTBM> W101 super passed it's goal, so just give em enough for whatever rewards you want
[1:30:08] <%GraceTBM> it's cool to pick up the same weapon to upgrade it again, but i can't remember if you lose those upgrades when swapping to another weapon in that slot
[1:30:35] <+jetjagger222> @GraceTBM you dont
[1:31:06] <%GraceTBM> that's a pretty good system then. just pick up whatever's around if you feel like using it, and the more dedicated you are to a gun the more effective it gets
[1:31:09] <+jetjagger222> you only lose upgrades on death
[1:31:10] <Tiewolf> Ima have to buy this game and kick every enemy in the game
[1:31:10] <arikk42> 40K YEN !!!!
[1:31:36] <rsg220> just tell minh theres a trophy for it
[1:31:49] <$SirGO0SE> @rsg220 LUL
[1:31:54] <BallerSwagBro9k> We still need 700k for the final goal
[1:32:04] <Ether101_Prime> You do lose it by picking up other weapons.
[1:32:08] <%GraceTBM> minh always seems to have such ambitious ideas about what mechanics are in each game
[1:32:31] <%GraceTBM> you do lose it ether? then that sucks! that deincentivizes using other weapons situationally
[1:32:56] <arikk42> it's 280K already
[1:33:18] <$SirGO0SE> Ba-Baka!
[1:33:19] <FaytxStay> boom
[1:33:31] <%Solidnick18> mmmmm
[1:33:32] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:33:32] <biomegabear> grinding
[1:33:35] <rsg220> STOP MINH BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE
[1:33:43] <%GraceTBM> you want to kill the enemies faster and more effectively, so you prioritize upgrades
[1:33:50] <OldManDeckardCain> if he could, minh would grind to lvl 999 in vanquish LUL
[1:33:53] <Ether101_Prime> As far as I remember the level ups are lost. Any other upgrades I don't know.
[1:33:56] <%Javaa01> @WoolieVersus Oh by the way, on the topic of Grenades, there's a tech to kick a grenade directly UP as you throw it, you have to start the sliding low toss and flip out of it during the animation
[1:33:59] <Louie_Salmon> This is 100% how I tried to play this game
[1:34:06] <%GraceTBM> minh maxed
[1:34:06] <%MoralCompassGaming> Mihn Maxing
[1:34:08] <Sapphire_Breeze> Minh maxing
[1:34:28] <$SirGO0SE> minhmax Kreygasm
[1:34:57] <%Solidnick18> he knows monkaS
[1:34:59] <xdeathknightx> fuck your bridge
[1:35:02] <+vaporousTippler> Got places to be, man.
[1:35:03] <BallerSwagBro9k> COWARD LUL
[1:35:13] <NeonBleu> Minh to the MAX
[1:35:18] <rsg220> minh maxing and speedrunning, gg vanquish it's been fun LUL
[1:35:37] <arikk42> Shinji Mikami: There are no repeating levels
[1:35:58] <%GraceTBM> didn't think it would interact with the enemies
[1:36:22] <%GraceTBM> i never liked how melee couldn't be used as a panic button cause it burns all your juice
[1:37:52] <xdeathknightx> Woolie gave tech about the flash kick and how to use it without burning your juice
[1:38:00] <+NekoNinja13> to fair I think they wanted the player to focus on the gunplay instead of allowing them to go all melee
[1:38:28] <%GraceTBM> that's fair, but even just losing half heat would make it feel more useful for low level players
[1:38:42] <+NekoNinja13> I get ya
[1:39:40] <%ozzrabbit> Minh got TANKED!
[1:39:59] <%GraceTBM> there's a lot of platinum games that i really wanted to love and spend time on, but never really managed to get a grasp on playing how the game wants me to play
[1:40:14] <+NekoNinja13> they had to strike a balance and I think making the melee an ultra move is better than how other devs regard melee in shooters
[1:40:23] <$SirGO0SE> LUL
[1:40:25] <Tiewolf> oof it's blows up
[1:40:30] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[1:40:35] <zocano> Well I genuinely think this game has a hard time deciding what it wants you to be in its encounter design
[1:40:36] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1229464161366794241?s=19
[1:40:42] <%GraceTBM> yeah, it's a good point that in many shooters it's a free instakill, contrast to that makes sense
[1:40:51] <zocano> Moreso than any other platinum game
[1:41:33] <zocano> Not to mention the “upgrade” system is the most anti-fun thing in any shooter ever
[1:42:06] <+NekoNinja13> hard disagree I love the upgrade system I this game
[1:42:06] <%GraceTBM> yeah, it seems like the slowdown is intended to let you be a jack of all trades wild card, but there's too many difficult situations where having the right equipment is too important
[1:43:00] <zocano> It literally discourages you from using weapons if you want stronger weapons
[1:43:10] <%GraceTBM> like, where's the fun in throwing down my upgraded pistol or grenade to use a sniper for four rounds and then being stuck with a bad version of the ar when i pick another up
[1:43:27] <zocano> It’s anti-fun
[1:43:46] <zocano> The game is just really confused in its design
[1:43:55] <%Solidnick18> come on barrel
[1:44:05] <+NekoNinja13> I get that, but the game does throw tons of upgrade cubes at you, and they toss tons of repeat weapons at you too
[1:44:07] <%GraceTBM> this upgrade system is like if in RE5 you didn't have an item box, and to use anything new you had to sell your old weapon and replace it
[1:44:17] <alexandrecau> fall up stupid
[1:44:32] <+jetjagger222> honestly the upgrades aren't mandatory
[1:44:33] <+theAncopro> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[1:44:38] <heartlesshealer> Telling Minh not to Minh
[1:44:45] <%Solidnick18> fight your mind goblins
[1:44:46] <%jiggy_snipe> mind goblins
[1:44:47] <+jetjagger222> IIRC the hardest difficulty forces unupgraded weapons
[1:44:50] <arikk42> Release the Bounds Rock Lee !!!
[1:44:59] <rubbishbinge> minh go MAX
[1:45:04] <zocano> The hardest difficulty also cuts your boost in half
[1:45:17] <zocano> It’s not a very fun difficulty
[1:45:19] <%GraceTBM> forcing unupgraded weapons lets yo ube more versatile; leaving you with the question of why implement upgrades
[1:45:27] <zocano> ^
[1:45:35] <biomegabear> WHOA THAT WAS SICK
[1:45:51] <zocano> The upgrade system is just largely unnecessary
[1:45:52] <+jetjagger222> i guess the system was already there and they just kludged it in. its unintuitive
[1:46:02] <+Andrizzleton> but what if Minh got more upgrades? atpChar
[1:46:24] <arikk42> Which System everyone takes for W101 ?
[1:46:32] <$SirGO0SE> *shrug* i like the upgrades.
[1:46:48] <%GraceTBM> upgrade systems do appeal to a broader casual audience, but it'll mostly just feel disappointing to anyone pulled in by that element specifically
[1:46:49] <+BionoidLCR> FailFish
[1:46:55] <+NekoNinja13> I cant say the upgrade system ever held me back in this game though
[1:46:57] <zocano> I was incredibly sparse with the “good” weapons because I wanted them upgraded so I just used two guns the while time
[1:47:01] <+jetjagger222> the problem is that its too obtuse for complete newbies to understand, and the benefits aren't so amazing to justify the hassle
[1:47:41] <+jetjagger222> the base antiarmor pistol is godly as-is
[1:47:42] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[1:51:06] <%Prevot> NEVER LOSES ITS LUSTER
[1:51:07] <$SirGO0SE> 2 QAers walk into a bar
[1:51:11] <alexandrecau> this is what happens when you don'T grenade
[1:51:13] <Louie_Salmon> I think if the screen comes up, it does count as a death.
[1:51:15] <blowntheguy> IM SO HAPPY
[1:51:18] <%DomPressesButtons> da fuck was that?!
[1:51:20] <biomegabear> I NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE
[1:51:20] <%FuqBoiSlim> He read the trophy guide.....
[1:51:26] <Ether101_Prime> This must have been the work of an enemy stand.
[1:51:26] <@chesterr01> @checktrap HeyGuys
[1:51:29] <Louie_Salmon> But if you quit during the animation, the death does not count.
[1:51:30] <%Solidnick18> Minh is that person
[1:51:35] <%Solidnick18> lol
[1:51:39] <%jepupu> woolieMINHSTINCT
[1:51:56] <OldManDeckardCain> minh would actually fall for pat's trick in that old ass creed video LUL

[1:52:02] <%ozzrabbit> SCUMMED OUT!!!!!
[1:52:02] <%GraceTBM> i'm LITERALLY the only person who would ever see that i got a trophy, so it's like hanging a medal in my own closet
[1:52:08] <zocano> I’ll probably replay this game eventually but it’s not very high on my platinum list

[1:54:19] <Holycow8498> By god it's a transformer
[1:54:22] <blowntheguy> RIP sweet prince
[1:54:29] <zocano> The melee eating fueling doesn’t bother me much honestly
[1:54:31] <%Solidnick18> OH GUN
[1:54:41] <Holycow8498> Is the platinum Transformer game still on sale?
[1:54:46] <+sir_louis> You're trying to flex on powers you don't understand!
[1:54:46] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[1:54:49] <%FuqBoiSlim> not digitally l
[1:55:01] <%gunsrlove> That looks like a bayo angel
[1:55:14] <blowntheguy> i was jus gonna say that
[1:55:25] <%GraceTBM> i was actually gonna do a virgin DMC rival character vs Chad doom marauder mirror match vs thad PC killer boss

[1:56:45] <%Solidnick18> YEE
[1:56:48] <%JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[1:56:50] <%GraceTBM> i also wouldn't have minded melee draining your heat if your heat wasn't also your health: i don't want melee to make me more vulnerable
[1:56:51] <Ner234> PogChamp
[1:57:04] <heartlesshealer> no
[1:57:27] <Louie_Salmon> I would have been upset if he didn't upgrade the guns there
[1:57:32] <%FuqBoiSlim> if melee only took like half instead of the entire gauge it'd be better
[1:57:46] <zocano> They basically want you to melee only when it’s most perfectly acceptable and open to you
[1:57:53] <zocano> Which is unfortunate
[1:57:57] <DedlokPM> "I dunno about her, brudda! She seems suspicious" woolieREGGIEFUL
[1:58:15] <%jiggy_snipe> sbfpBleetz sbfpBleetz sbfpBleetz
[1:58:39] <%GraceTBM> this game actually reminds me a lot of a really high octane version of binary domain
[1:58:50] <Fart_Explosions> tactical slide action
[1:58:56] <zayasu> LUL
[1:59:00] <+theAncopro> he rolled in thinking its DS
[1:59:06] <zocano> I remember distinctly loving Binary Domain and being very nonplussed by this game
[1:59:07] <NeddTheNerd> a real champ LUL
[1:59:07] <%FuqBoiSlim> Antonio brown type beat
[1:59:08] <$SirGO0SE> minh is probably going to beat this today
[1:59:16] <+lethallunacyx> Like Wilder?
[1:59:20] <Ner234> It's a crime that game has no sequels or any kind of follow up.
[1:59:23] <blowntheguy> lol
[1:59:25] <zocano> They both exist next to each other in my head even though they are years apart
[1:59:33] <%GraceTBM> binary domain is dramatically less stylish, but much more comprehensible, ironically enough
[1:59:34] <+lethallunacyx> He took it like a champ right on his jaw
[1:59:40] <@chesterr01> @lethallunacyx LUL
[1:59:48] <zocano> It’s also just got fun characters
[1:59:55] <Tucker0603> BOOST MG!!!!
[2:00:02] <$SirGO0SE> reggie in chat and on the screen? how can he be in 2 places at once?!
[2:00:16] <%GraceTBM> yeah, a lot of the characters in this feel more generic than BD
[2:00:20] <%Prevot> fuck no
[2:00:28] <%Javaa01> And Hard Corps was ALSO fucking terrible
[2:00:30] <%jiggy_snipe> LUL
[2:00:34] <%Prevot> Contra should just be classic 2D Contra
[2:00:35] <$SirGO0SE> BD has way better characters but this game plays sick
[2:00:36] <Ether101_Prime> There are many Contra games MGS3, MGS4 and MGS5.
[2:00:38] <zocano> Binary Domain is absolutely less stylish and “plain” but I just simply enjoyed it more
[2:00:40] <+lethallunacyx> @chesterr01 boxing
[2:00:48] <NickHatesSnow> Shattered Solider is fucking cool
[2:00:50] <+TysonPG> contra rogue corps was horrid wasnt it
[2:01:00] <worldbrand> a 10 year old game with no sequels
[2:01:12] <artoflec> Binary Domain is just okay compared to this game but it has cool ideas and the robots break apart nice
[2:01:16] <segbas2004> yes and they did not make that much money out of it :(
[2:01:17] <DarknessD42> Like Konami?
[2:01:20] <$SirGO0SE> video games were ruined when they added more than 2 buttons
[2:01:21] <zocano> This game made it very hard for me to enjoy it it
[2:01:22] <+jetjagger222> BD also had better music
[2:01:32] <blowntheguy> yeah i remeber being super bored with binary domain
[2:01:36] <%jiggy_snipe> yea that looked like a mistake
[2:01:38] <$xXxPS9xXx> Havent played it but maybe Contra Rogue corps was good? Hey, hey, hey, come on, put down the pitch forks!
[2:01:38] <+MellowxDee> rogue corps shouldn't have even been a contra title.
[2:01:39] <%GraceTBM> the upgrade system in BD was also way better LUL LUL
[2:01:45] <$SirGO0SE> MORE BACKSEAT
[2:01:52] <worldbrand> LUL

[2:03:12] <%GraceTBM> r u sure he shouldn't be using his grenades
[2:03:32] <$xXxPS9xXx> This wouldn't be happening if minh had more upgrades
[2:03:32] <$SirGO0SE> nice
[2:03:51] <+jetjagger222> @Ether101_Prime its incredibly tempting but i already have too much hobby shit
[2:04:02] <Ether101_Prime> What does these guys look like Bayformers Megatron?

[2:04:30] <Ether101_Prime> @jetjagger222 I know that feeling. Have a few minis that I need to paint.
[2:04:39] <Tucker0603> Boost MG is biggest dps
[2:05:51] <segbas2004> it's true!
[2:05:52] <%Taglog7> It is known
[2:05:58] <Louie_Salmon> Is that actually true or does Woolie just want to see cool shit
[2:06:08] <segbas2004> it's not
[2:06:12] <%Solidnick18> trophy PogChamp
[2:06:15] <$xXxPS9xXx> why not both
[2:06:20] <+hoenhime344> no its true.
[2:06:26] <%BioHunter> more damage in slo mo
[2:06:37] <segbas2004> it looks cool tho
[2:06:39] <+hoenhime344> its said in the manuel
[2:06:40] <Tucker0603> the boost machine gun, the orange one is the most dps as far as I know
[2:07:04] <%Solidnick18> i miss it
[2:07:18] <%FuqBoiSlim> when's the last time a game had a manual?
[2:07:19] <segbas2004> ewww
[2:07:22] <segbas2004> WutFace
[2:07:22] <%StaceMcGate> "eviler" Hilary Clinton
[2:07:23] <%GraceTBM> still doesn't do more damage and go faster in realtime in reality though, just more proportionally compared to the game's realtime
[2:07:26] <zocano> Hi Hillary
[2:07:38] <%GraceTBM> that's such a japanese line
[2:07:58] <quasiplaying> Seems like it
[2:08:03] <+jetjagger222> LUL
[2:08:06] <+bimblehim> did someone say... politics??
[2:08:07] <%Javaa01> Oh yeah, this mission is neat
[2:08:08] <quasiplaying> Better time line confirmed
[2:08:09] <segbas2004> it's "A" timeline
[2:08:10] <%Prevot> hillary? oh no is the president evil in this game? LUL
[2:08:18] <vVAstrAVv> they have jetpacks. what do you think woolie? lol
[2:08:27] <quasiplaying> Gears of War?!
[2:08:28] <%GraceTBM> reflex boosters and space colonies? way better than concentration camps and white supremacists
[2:08:32] <$xXxPS9xXx> wait, we could have had bad ass slo mo boosting armor if hilary was president? I want a recount
[2:08:34] <+jetjagger222> not to mention the super cool skating power armor
[2:08:38] <Louie_Salmon> I mean there's space wars and flying putin, so it's kind of a better timeline by default
[2:08:40] <quasiplaying> Look at this old man Gears of War
[2:08:56] <vVAstrAVv> cus IIII think hed give up a black president for a jetpack lol
[2:08:56] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff

[2:10:58] <+jetjagger222> exactly what woolie's saying
[2:11:02] <%GraceTBM> i was joking about every 360 game being filled with walk and radio sections
[2:11:10] <zocano> Ye I know
[2:11:12] <%Taglog7> but poses though
[2:11:23] <townzzzzz> figuart ver. when
[2:11:28] <Ner234> Get the SICKEST pose then never touch it again
[2:11:38] <tanarath> @woolieversus 3-d print/glue replacement parts?
[2:11:38] <bear_breaker20> touch it once maybe every 4 yrs
[2:11:39] <$SirGO0SE> @GraceTBM as we know explaining the joke makes it twice as funny
[2:11:44] <+jetjagger222> yeah you can't be too rough on play arts figs, unlike revoltech or figma
[2:11:59] <%GraceTBM> it's a time honored practice

[2:19:53] <%GraceTBM> my reaction speed is too shit to do hit confirms
[2:19:58] <xdeathknightx> Minh has played DMC, DMC2 is his favorite
[2:19:58] <worldbrand> a link to the mash
[2:19:58] <+hoenhime344> every link is a mihnicale
[2:20:09] <ultimatemegahero1> Woolie! :D
[2:20:14] <%GraceTBM> i forgot about that knight, that makes a lot of sense now
[2:20:16] <+lethallunacyx> This is not a mashing community
[2:20:17] <+theAncopro> DMC2 is his fav cause he can mash guns to win
[2:20:22] <%GraceTBM> DMC2 is a one button game after all

[3:15:28] <%FuqBoiSlim> I remember that last airbender game kn the 360 having real easy Cheevos Kappa
[3:15:47] <$SirGO0SE> thats some twisted antisocial shit yo
[3:16:08] <+TysonPG> Stanley parables achievments are designed to mess with people
[3:16:30] <%Javaa01> And to expose people who cheat to get the cheevos
[3:16:39] <+TysonPG> i did :)
[3:16:46] <%Javaa01> wooliePOYO

[3:17:00] <%DensityD> SwiftRage MY BAR
[3:17:02] <MrWummzy> facts are facts some peoples "opinions" are just a lack of information and experience witch the subject witch makes there "opinion" obviously wrong to the other party in some scenarios...if you cant debate your opinion you haven't thought about it enough to have valuable opinion.
[3:17:06] <%Solidnick18> i get that
[3:17:07] <%DensityD> JUST GIVE ME 110%

[3:17:37] <%DensityD> it's like the health bar, make it bigger
[3:17:44] <vVAstrAVv> all trophy lists Should max at 93%
[3:17:46] <%HelghastTroop> Achievement sluts are basically dopamine addicts
[3:17:54] <MrWummzy> auto correct made me look dumb af but you get my point
[3:17:58] <KaiserMario> Likesin
[3:18:01] <+DrPoxx> Extremes are how I enjoy my Cheetos and my life
[3:18:24] <PlumpPotatoRump> that sounds kinda OCD-esque

[3:18:31] <Meeeese> But there's a guy who got free XBL for life for getting like a million gamer points OMGScoots
[3:18:31] <oniwahoo> Wow, Woolie shitting on Barbie's Horse Adventure like it's not the best game ever made Kappa
[3:18:35] <vVAstrAVv> just play a clicker game you sad sick fucks
[3:18:41] <worldbrand> man im glad i dont have those brain goblins
[3:18:42] <%Exiliator> I dont kinkshame :)
[3:18:49] <%Kalinflip> me too
[3:18:53] <%FuqBoiSlim> this sounds like coke fiend behavior
[3:19:00] <$SirGO0SE> i wonder how many more years of not having sex i need to achieve in order to be a gamer as epic as this guy
[3:19:14] <Meeeese> Addictions can be satisfying though Kappa
[3:19:36] <%Exiliator> Minh has a point there woolieMINHSTINCT
[3:19:49] <$SirGO0SE> BABY there aint nothin wrong, with a little bump and grind ;)
[3:19:58] <MrWummzy> That's becasue you can get satisfaction from improving...getting something like achievements that has no value wat so ever is dumb
[3:20:05] <Meeeese> @SirGO0SE PJSalt
[3:20:08] <MrWummzy> you value nothing that makes you a sadist
[3:20:16] <%jepupu> Minh is like Pat in that sense. He likes the number get high.
[3:20:56] <OldManDeckardCain> let's be real, pat's obsession with high numbers is caused by pat's lack of height numbers LUL
[3:20:56] <@Moobot> Here are the available commands: !MOTIVATED, !uptime, !twitter, !schedule
[3:21:10] <%jepupu> He shares that with Minh
[3:21:25] <%Exiliator> There are people who like to sort things, and find satisfaction in seeing everything in nice order, even if there is no point or use of it
[3:21:32] <MrWummzy> The achievement hunters are literal sadist...In competitive games or mmo grind you can value the interaction with other players or improving at your craft. A number is a number and has zero value and if you value it you have a problem tbh
[3:21:52] <%HelghastTroop> You have to mainline the achievements
[3:21:57] <$SirGO0SE> pah stuh
[3:22:04] <OldManDeckardCain> achievement hunters are actually masochists
[3:22:14] <OldManDeckardCain> have you seen some of those cheevos LUL
[3:22:20] <worldbrand> aw that was a perfectly good ham and cheese sandwich, it's a shame you only ate the ham
[3:22:24] <dredshift> A good achievement list incentivizes you to explore every mode in the game
[3:22:37] <lemon_lore> despair trying to get those last few
[3:22:37] <clawedMonet> dang now i'm hungry
[3:22:43] <Meeeese> @MrWummzy I feel like MMOs are a bit different because you play the same game for years and years (WoW is at 16 years) and eventually just want different stuff to do. Vs. Doing the grind on different arbitrary things every day
[3:22:54] <worldbrand> i like achievements when they offer creative challenges rather than completion
[3:23:04] <%Exiliator> I think achivement hunting is a thing that sort of goes beyond the single games themselves, finding ways to efficiently increase the number is "the gameplay", not the actual games
[3:23:28] <+TysonPG> My cousin hacked his xbox account to give him every achievement for every game he owned does that count as a competitionist
[3:23:37] <%StaceMcGate> Minus 50 DKP
[3:23:47] <JDebss> For FUN
[3:23:49] <Meeeese> And THATS why I quit MMOs
[3:23:55] <vVAstrAVv> yeah raid commitments will forever gatekeep savage for me
[3:24:10] <%DensityD> sidenote: back in their time, wenches provided much more valuable services to society than today's whores, sluts, and escorts. there is some overlap, but a wench does polite society things too.
[3:24:11] <MrWummzy> @Meeeese yea but you can still improve at optimizing your game play...it has a competitive skill cap that you can almost never reach...just like aiming like a imbot in a shooter its a infinite skill cap if you see the way to improve
[3:24:11] <+TysonPG> need vs greed
[3:24:19] <arbeh> WoW has a loot distribution system like that, DKP yeah
[3:24:20] <$SirGO0SE> when i burned out on WoW i never went back. shit was such an obvious problem when i looked at it hindsight
[3:24:21] <%DensityD> 50 DKP MINUS
[3:24:21] <%netrac> That is ancient
[3:24:27] <%DensityD> MORE DOTS
[3:24:29] <segbas2004> DKP is for looting
[3:24:32] <%SomersaultJustice> MORE DOTS
[3:24:32] <segbas2004> sharing the lot
[3:24:35] <$SirGO0SE> OK STOP DOTS
[3:24:36] <arbeh> DKP is super super old though, not in FF XIV
[3:24:48] <zocano> GET THE WELPS
[3:24:50] <+wicketpelican> Pat said on a podcast explaining some stuff about FF XIV
[3:25:01] <DedlokPM> @WoolieVersus DKp you probably heard from that infamous WOW Raid meme vid
[3:25:04] <%DensityD> HANDLE IT
[3:25:06] <%Exiliator> DKP is so abusable maan
[3:25:12] <%ozzrabbit> From Pat probably
[3:25:35] <+tuchpi> ALL SUCK
[3:25:40] <zocano> This is why statics from people you are already comfortable around is better
[3:25:49] <+theAncopro> is this the mentality of people who spend $1000 on virtual spaceships so when they lose its real
[3:25:51] <@Moobot> Wha'cha trying to do? No links! @SirGO0SE
[3:25:51] <Xelhesia> this^
[3:25:54] <zocano> Out of friend groups or common discord peeps
[3:26:08] <%DensityD> yeah, that EVE online shit
[3:26:24] <$SirGO0SE> only thing i miss about WoW was it taught me video editing. i had a video series with ~5mil views on warcraftvideos and for a young kid that was a hell of a rush
[3:26:38] <%DensityD> oooh, nice
[3:26:38] <zocano> But just trying to sign into a static from within the game is basically a dice roll crap shoot
[3:26:39] <MrWummzy> I think its more about improving you skill for me...optimizing everything and constantly looking for ways to improve even in casual games...For those wow players optimizing actions and dps is like a competitive experience
[3:26:46] <PlumpPotatoRump> Soooooo... Vanquished
[3:26:54] <%Solidnick18> stretch goals
[3:27:01] <zayasu> woolie are you gonna take a look at dbfz season 3?
[3:27:08] <%Kalinflip> achievements only matter when they give you in game rewards
[3:27:14] <zocano> Cheevos and trophies are fun for me in games I already like
[3:27:14] <$SirGO0SE> ^^^
[3:27:22] <%Exiliator> Some people like climbing mountains, some people like having climbed the mountain, and standing on the top looking down, some people like having CLIMBED all the mountains. They dont care about the climbing itself, nor the view.
[3:27:38] <+theAncopro> rmember when uplay first introduced? they used to make achievements into ingame rewards
[3:27:50] <$SirGO0SE> the other thing i like achievements for is for games like slay the spire. i like checking in on my friends to see what they have and havent accomplished
[3:28:07] <MrWummzy> @kalinflip or if its a chevment that is hard and requires you to be skilled or improve and play a different way to earn it
[3:28:07] <@Moobot> Check here for the current schedule: https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz/status/1229464161366794241?s=19
[3:28:34] <chronoxgp> !uptime
[3:28:34] <@Moobot> WoolieVS has been SSStyling for 3 hours and 28 minutes
[3:28:37] <Xelhesia> hardcore raid groups in ffxiv are fun as hell with friends. randoms not so much
[3:28:43] <MrWummzy> @Kalinflip like some of the dead rising 1 achievements
[3:28:45] <$SirGO0SE> so games that after like 200 hours you still only have like 40% of achievements. where theyre hard enough/descriptive of the loop to the point where you can identify how far someone has come in a game
[3:28:51] <%DensityD> gotta catch em all
[3:29:10] <+theAncopro> have there ever been negative cheevo points
[3:29:18] <%DensityD> THERE SHOULD BE
[3:29:19] <$SirGO0SE> wow

[3:31:21] <+theAncopro> yakuza 0: i did it for the achievement
[3:31:28] <$SirGO0SE> Operation Sneaky Sneaks :c
[3:31:47] <MrWummzy> Some people just dont see video games as something that requires skill so they play mindlessly and never think about improving and shit talk people who are good for being "no lifers" even tho they play just as much
[3:32:00] <%Exiliator> When I played Fallout 3 on xbox 360, pretty much every quest had an achivement associated with it. So I used it for tracking completion %. Kappa
[3:32:00] <%Solidnick18> right
[3:32:18] <%Exiliator> And girls und panzer is great
[3:32:19] <CureMode666> YES, assassins creed 2 didnt give me chapter 6 trophy

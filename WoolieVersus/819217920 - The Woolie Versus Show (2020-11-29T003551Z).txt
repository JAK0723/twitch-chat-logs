[1:18:20] <xwiishirex> @marvel877 That's crazy, I love it!
[1:18:21] <NoireRequiem> @marvel877 may be TOS when Zangief rips mario to shreds
[1:18:23] <+terry_quest> ohh god yea imagine having pets
[1:18:24] <andrewofbob> It really is dail-up hairpin
[1:18:26] <shooziii> Too soon jr
[1:18:27] <+terry_quest> they would go wild
[1:18:33] <ZippyPsycho> You rang? majinoHooksubs
[1:18:34] <Yudoken> Woolies bizarre house tour
[1:18:45] <Tampaoster> if the connection was perfect, this would be the perfect toy
[1:18:45] <floralkami> I'm surprised Woolie isn't puking his guts out, cause this is disorienting...
[1:18:46] <JonnyZeFox> idk if zangief would be an obstacle; more like a lose condition when he eats mario
[1:18:49] <aiutare47> This seems like one of those concepts thats REALLY cool, but the tech isnt quite there yet. I love AR stuff and want to see the concept expanded.
[1:18:52] <%Livelinne> retroS retroS retroS
[1:18:58] <NoireRequiem> it becomes a memory game eventually
[1:19:01] <Triplicat> it's over
[1:19:01] <Meltgar> Nice 5th place Kappa
[1:19:03] <Solidnick18> oh
[1:19:05] <Yudoken> This is almost as disorienting as bad vr.
[1:19:07] <SailorJagen> @aiutare47 i completely agree
[1:19:10] <BaslerJones> yeah this is really janky
[1:19:12] <nevan_44> yeah this kinda makes me wanna barf LUL
[1:19:20] <marvel877> How far away from the Switch is all of this?
[1:19:22] <VidulaSaix> LUL
[1:19:23] <%alphalejandro> Well...GAME OVER YEAHH!!
[1:19:23] <@Solidus_113> EATHEN
[1:19:27] <%MyNameIsRasus> IT ALL COMES TUMBLING DOWN
[1:19:28] <NoireRequiem> Eva 01 not compliant
[1:19:33] <+dawsfloss> why is the camera like that tho lol
[1:19:37] <huskarl_zap> I kid younot Mortin, he turns himself into a pickle.
[1:19:40] <%RyuuAoi> @woolieversus You plan on doing a full Super Mario 3D World co-op LP with Reggie? Me and my boy knocked that one out like champs!
[1:19:42] <andrewofbob> Switch is right next to the ramp up
[1:19:42] <haitakaa> does the car actually run into stuff or does it just stop when it detects something
[1:19:43] <Solidnick18> atleast you finished
[1:19:45] <%Livelinne> LUL
[1:19:45] <SailorJagen> the camera just bugs out sometimes
[1:19:47] <+starzo0> it actually kinda worked that time
[1:19:51] <+Bailey__gaming> this looks super jank
[1:19:53] <ozmon> I can see why this is so short range now, they've got a lot of AR stuff to track at once
[1:20:07] <+terry_quest> @haitakaa it runs into shit
[1:20:10] <%FeelinNifty> katamario
[1:20:11] <%MyNameIsRasus> Make it smaller
[1:20:18] <Tampaoster> Race war ove
[1:20:20] <MBDiana1> an attempt was made
[1:20:25] <NoireRequiem> downhill real slow like?
[1:20:30] <floralkami> just take it off
[1:20:35] <aiutare47> hope this sells well enough for Nintendo to consider workshopping the tech. Even better if the community picks it up, higher output batteries and rube-goldberg tracks would be sick.
[1:20:36] <BaslerJones> go under the couch PogChamp
[1:20:36] <TigerClaws12> can't you just get rid of the ramp when it's inverted?
[1:20:36] <%RyuuAoi> NO ITS FINE JUMP THE CURB
[1:20:45] <dots4eyes> If you invert them then it can just drop down
[1:20:46] <JonnyZeFox> a future with outside long range tech would be awesome so I support nintendo pushing boundaries at least
[1:20:47] <xwiishirex> instead of invert, remix?
[1:20:49] <ozmon> Course 2: Hellish Streamer Room
[1:20:51] <andrewofbob> Yes, just remove the kitchen floor
[1:20:52] <@Menitta> Yeah you could just remove the ramp
[1:21:02] <%MyNameIsRasus> @TigerClaws12 there's a drop in the EVA part
[1:21:05] <Ipsenscastle> make it a circuit rather than a figure 8?
[1:21:09] <@Menitta> Oh wow thats cool
[1:21:15] <TigerClaws12> @MyNameIsRasus oh shit, didn't notice LUL
[1:21:17] <+OhioNitsud> is woolie driving through his apartment?
[1:21:21] <RamenRiderZ> In the future we will have a small Mario robot and Super Mario Maker LIVE
[1:21:23] <haisho> man this seems sick on paper but I can't see it working if the connection is being wonky like this
[1:21:23] <BaslerJones> oh nice camera
[1:21:27] <kingofgames726> hey its W
[1:21:41] <%Dr00_PhD> Count up those sins

[1:22:01] <xwiishirex> Too bab-y!
[1:22:03] <andrewofbob> Baby park denied
[1:22:05] <NoireRequiem> no babby's allowed
[1:22:06] <%0rond> maybe don't have a super tight 180 degree turn right at the spot wit hthe worst connection?
[1:22:07] <MrCorazon44> Call it Woolie Park
[1:22:07] <%TrafficCohen> DAYTONA
[1:22:10] <xwiishirex> What is this bab-y shit?!
[1:22:20] <Overloard> easy mode is NOT selectable
[1:22:27] <haisho> that turn is the worst
[1:22:34] <%Livelinne> lucidSoy
[1:22:35] <+terry_quest> so the connection this is from car to controller?
[1:22:37] <JonnyZeFox> "Sir, we don't have 0cc here."
[1:22:40] <+terry_quest> thing*
[1:22:41] <oshemp> maybe move gate 2 closer? It seems to consistently stutter around there
[1:22:45] <RamenRiderZ> Red bar experience
[1:22:45] <Overloard> the poor connection is part of the challenge
[1:22:47] <andrewofbob> Like I said, dail-up hairpin
[1:22:53] <NoireRequiem> Kappa
[1:22:56] <%BinaryFireball> wait so is there a hotwheels driving around his apartment right now?
[1:22:57] <chestersan> is this the woolie house tour?
[1:23:01] <huskarl_zap> BAN WIFI
[1:23:05] <%BinaryFireball> or did he already scan his place?
[1:23:06] <gingersnipsnap> @livelinne lucidHey
[1:23:21] <@Menitta> That crossover reminds me of that Luigi Circuit from Double Dash
[1:23:29] <ozmon> Here's where you make a makeshift overpass and travel onto the couch back to Gate 1
[1:23:30] <RetroCop87> OH GOD, what a horrible night for a course
[1:23:38] <+terry_quest> yes there is a tiny car going around his place

[1:34:05] <JonnyZeFox> @GeltonZ i was thinking it would record while drawing the track the first go round. so the player plays a video version. so it would sacrifice real time data for a smoother experience

[2:20:57] <Idon__> nothin, just means he reflects projectiles
[2:21:02] <%0rond> it's a weak block that uses up concentration
[2:21:07] <%Graxe_> If Beowulf is the same as in 4, it also has just releases on its charges for extra damage
[2:21:13] <$razielhex> @viciousarcanum XBSX I think
[2:21:19] <$razielhex> XBXSX
[2:21:30] <Overloard> faaack youuu
[2:21:30] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:21:31] <hassanico2> Does anyone think Vergil's rotating swords always looked like hammers?
[2:21:36] <Afterman_> I bet Reggie would be a huge v fan
[2:21:46] <+MajorCrasher> LUL
[2:21:48] <+paladinstarbuster> Muther
[2:21:50] <floralkami> still have my fingers crossed
[2:21:52] <+Daxalog> Ladies Night was a haux
[2:21:52] <Solidnick18> FeelsBadMan
[2:21:54] <rufus2k2> @hassanico2 sound like Diablo 2
[2:21:56] <+TopTieramisu> ladies' night <not> out
[2:21:58] <jubejube56> Hmm I wonder why Vergil can randomly become V for one of his moves?
[2:22:01] <Who_lio42> saved for DMC5 SE:SE edition
[2:22:04] <@Solidus_113> NEVER GETS OLD
[2:22:06] <floralkami> or at least give me a Mod
[2:22:08] <TheVoltStrike> Well Trish has no sword, she'd be in full punch mode
[2:22:12] <jayROCCCA> Roses are red, chocolate is delectable. You are no worthy opponent. Easy Mode is now selectable.
[2:22:12] <Parapattern> Faaathuuur
[2:22:14] <%bread_assassin> How is V fighting Vergil? He seems like he'd have a tough time because of how he fights.
[2:22:18] <aiutare47> "NUT NUT" -Reggie
[2:22:24] <Idon__> when they gonna give trish alastor, no one uses that anymore
[2:22:27] <+DomunDomunDomun> @TheVoltStrike Punch m-mother
[2:22:31] <%Irridium> I mean there is a mod that replaces Dante's model with Lady's but... not the same :(
[2:22:35] <rufus2k2> I wish Itsuno-san would bring back Lucia with a fighting style built from the ground up
[2:22:44] <Vyneci> He's not popping his SDT so it only takes 25% of the bar and is instead using it all NotLikeThis
[2:22:46] <jubejube56> @bread_assassin run and pray for nightmare
[2:22:50] <@Menitta> Clean Cut
[2:22:55] <+LoudBog> Woolie is taking Reggie down a dark dark path
[2:23:03] <+MoonlightAigis> dang woolie lackin on them air taunts
[2:23:06] <rufus2k2> Alastor got sold off ages ago according to the lore
[2:23:06] <nevan_44> SourPls
[2:23:07] <+TheBesteban> I interviewed Casey about the song. Ishould edit that for somethign soon
[2:23:10] <witchdoctorpinkish> BORN IN FLAMES
[2:23:10] <+ManOfReason> NUT
[2:23:11] <%ekodrop> per character
[2:23:16] <%FuqBoiSlim> I know Ladies' Night was basically a pipe dream but im still disappointed lowkey cuz I'm one of the 15 people who thought Trish was fun as in 4SE
[2:23:26] <rufus2k2> also DMC3 Cerberus got broken :(
[2:23:29] <%FuqBoiSlim> *asf in 4SE
[2:23:29] <helixidron> @TheBesteban Whoa, i'd definitely would watch that
[2:23:47] <huskarl_zap> oh no the coonsoomer is lose
[2:23:55] <%Sparkseid> Sparkseid gifted a Tier 1 sub to TheBesteban! They have given 3 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[2:23:57] <jayROCCCA> I love Trish and Lady in 4
[2:23:59] <%TheBesteban> @Sparkseid Thanks for the gift sub!
[2:23:59] <LinguineBobini> trish was my favorite char in 4se PogChamp @FuqBoiSlim
[2:24:00] <%0rond> coomsoomer
[2:24:00] <+doc_savage> Annd for some reason Dante has the worst theme
[2:24:06] <auraofdawn> air combo fodder
[2:24:07] <%baronouroboros> oof
[2:24:11] <$razielhex> SSS-<B
[2:24:13] <+ghostfaceninja_> bury is amazing, but devil trigger is still the best imo
[2:24:14] <+paladinstarbuster> Subhuman is fine
[2:24:26] <cerazor01> I kinda liked the Subhuman Mix for the first couple hours I played Dante
[2:24:35] <Ner234> Subhuman grew on me after a while
[2:24:37] <Uselesswhitenoise> subhuman is worse then all of dantes old songs though
[2:24:46] <%FuqBoiSlim> @jayroccca @linguinebobini y'all get it parappaW
[2:24:52] <haisho> Subhuman works in the game but as a song itself...meh
[2:24:56] <Cobaltor_252> does Vergil heal when you bring his Doppelganger out?
[2:24:56] <%TheBesteban> @helixidron It's for a larger thing I'm doing on the music of KI, I'll probably put it out when it's done.
[2:24:57] <+MoonlightAigis> i like how subhuman kinda reflects dante just being a little tired and pissed off in this game
[2:25:01] <+DizzyGunner> the only problem with the devil trigger song is: i always end up thinking of that cringe ass performance of it at the VGAs
[2:25:18] <UltimateDomon> V's is the best
[2:25:22] <hassanico2> Subhuman
[2:25:24] <kenny_biff> subhuman?
[2:25:24] <witchdoctorpinkish> Subhuman
[2:25:24] <+Daxalog> YOU CANNOT KILL ME
[2:25:25] <dustyjordans> SUBHUMAN IS THE BEST THEME
[2:25:26] <+paladinstarbuster> When you hit SSS and U CANNOT KILL ME jumps in I get so hype
[2:25:27] <+MajorCrasher> SUBHUMAN IS GREAT
[2:25:29] <SomeAsianDood> Subhuman is fine
[2:25:32] <+DomunDomunDomun> YOU CANNOT KILL ME I AM SUBHUMAN
[2:25:33] <cerazor01> I think Vergil's new coat looks kinda bad from the back in motion.
[2:25:34] <kenny_biff> subhuman is okaaaay
[2:25:34] <+RenoDeGeneric> @dustyjordans you wild
[2:25:35] <stardustcrusad3r> naw subhuman is good
[2:25:35] <@Solidus_113> The song is literally Subhuman
[2:25:37] <helixidron> cool, killer instinct, right? that game's OST is also really good
[2:25:38] <UltimateDomon> Subhuman is great in-game
[2:25:38] <SomeAsianDood> The OG cover was shit though
[2:25:39] <Uselesswhitenoise> whats is dantes best song
[2:25:43] <Uselesswhitenoise> devils never cry right
[2:25:46] <+Zepshire> Dante deserves better
[2:25:47] <dustyjordans> @RenoDeGeneric wild and right
[2:25:47] <+LoudBog> the Little V mix of Subhuman would be fine in the game
[2:25:50] <@Menitta> Compared to fucking Bury the Light and Devil Trigger
[2:25:51] <+someyounguy1> what theme? devils never cry is great
[2:25:52] <auraofdawn> it sounds like it belongs in DmC, thats why
[2:25:53] <UltimateDomon> I'd never listen to it by itself but when you hit that SSS its great
[2:25:54] <%Irridium> look, just go into the gallery and you can pick his DMC1, 3, 4 or even 2 one if you're into that
[2:25:55] <Solidnick18> i mean they patched it best they could
[2:25:55] <@Menitta> Subhuman sucks
[2:25:59] <ArthurDoyleRPG> Subhuman garbage
[2:25:59] <+marlborored5> @WoolieVersus you know if vergil hits 4 perfects judment cuts he says "jackpot"?
[2:26:00] <nevan_44> if it was just instrumentals it would be good LUL
[2:26:07] <+wydamn> and there's the whole original writer of Subhuman may have been a paedophile thing
[2:26:10] <$razielhex> Oh No
[2:26:21] <$razielhex> Can we hit 4xS
[2:26:28] <cerazor01> Leaf off of the Tree
[2:26:37] <UltimateDomon> The new singer is also way better
[2:26:45] <+RenoDeGeneric> @dustyjordans atpCarl
[2:26:47] <andrewofbob> The Sparda themes from DMC1 don’t get enough recognition
[2:26:49] <Afterman_> anyone else sad af about how Langdon became a crazy qanon dude?
[2:26:57] <%yeknomlive> the old singer not he one in game
[2:27:04] <Thetruestblacksun> @marlborored5 It was the first thing he attempted
[2:27:15] <+M3djedx> M3djedx subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! Let’s goo
[2:27:18] <%FuqBoiSlim> It's sad but its unexpected i remember him being down that path for a minute
[2:27:18] <CyrusVGZ> My dad works at Capcom and told me the protag of DMC6 is a black guy and his theme song is 90s jazz rap.
[2:27:23] <+marlborored5> @Thetruestblacksun as expected from him, i'm not disappointed
[2:27:24] <+wydamn> @Afterman_ Is that true? That sucks, but I guess I'm not surprised, he's the kind of guy that would.
[2:27:27] <%FuqBoiSlim> *its not unexpected
[2:27:32] <@akuda_bar> be not afraid
[2:27:40] <Afterman_> @wydamn yeah go look at his Twitter
[2:27:42] <+ghostfaceninja_> is this Reggie's first time seeing this game?
[2:27:42] <%M3djedx> woolieYE
[2:27:45] <@Solidus_113> that really does no damage
[2:27:46] <%Irridium> i fucking love Nightmare's big dumb bodyslam so much
[2:27:50] <helixidron> i still think they should have a different sound effect for V's World
[2:27:50] <$razielhex> @Afterman_ LAngdon has always been a shithead.

[2:28:14] <viciousarcanum> How come woolz chose XSX over PS5?
[2:28:21] <auraofdawn> god his trickster is so good for this fight
[2:28:26] <%FuqBoiSlim> He has both of em
[2:28:27] <cerazor01> It kinda sucks that they've never made a Vergil outfit based on the concept art for a Vergil dmc 1 design. Vergil would fucking sick in Disco bell bottoms.
[2:28:27] <%RyuuAoi> @woolieversus DO NOT STOP PLAYING. WE DO IT.
[2:28:28] <Afterman_> @razielhex has it been always? I knew after Cameron's avatar he became obsessed with aliens but I thought he just recently ish became worse
[2:28:36] <@Solidus_113> @viciousarcanum It's the one he could get without issue

[2:30:26] <floralkami> probably not
[2:30:34] <gordieda20> POWER
[2:30:41] <Solidnick18> he is a nerd
[2:30:46] <$razielhex> @wydamn Reuben Langdon
[2:30:52] <Afterman_> @wydamn he's all about aliens. not sure I'd he's a scientologist
[2:30:53] <+ghostfaceninja_> Vergil would say fun is childish
[2:30:56] <Ner234> Does Woolie have the EX Taunt?
[2:30:59] <@Solidus_113> cutcutcutcutcutcutcutcutcutcut
[2:31:00] <floralkami> otherwise, Woolie would be doing it
[2:31:06] <auraofdawn> my god that is broken

[2:31:12] <@Menitta> you can JCC after that and its so good
[2:31:14] <@Menitta> CLEAN CUT
[2:31:15] <+wydamn> @Afterman_ aren't scientologists all about aliens?
[2:31:18] <viciousarcanum> Interesting, i'm surprised he day one'd any of the new consoles tbh, the lure of judgement nut must've been real strong lol
[2:31:28] <Jashter18> Blendered them
[2:31:32] <hassanico2> what are these called again?
[2:31:36] <%FuqBoiSlim> If Dante and Vergil weren't homeschooled, Vergil would most definitely be that kid who would tell the teachers they forgot to assign homework
[2:31:36] <aiutare47> Woolie is slowly leading Reggie to the rabbit hole, waiting for the most opportune moment to push him in.
[2:31:39] <+wydamn> @razielhex that's who I'm looking at. His face looks similar but I wasn't sure it was him.
[2:31:40] <Monkeyweed21> @wydamn he used to be all about secret aliens, but he fell off the deep end with Qanon and Anti Vax shit recently
[2:31:58] <Afterman_> @wydamn that part yes. idk if he follows the rest of their stuff/buys into their pyramid shit. I just know IN GENERAL he's alien obsessed
[2:32:11] <floralkami> @viciousarcanum technically much later than day one, but yeah
[2:32:12] <Vyneci> S P E E N
[2:32:21] <@Menitta> Also I love how if you let Vergil do his sword animation, you get another pip of meter
[2:32:21] <%Gamefriendly> @WoolieVersus the down trick cancels everything compared to the others, well thats what it seems like to me
[2:32:28] <AFlyingTaco1> Scientologists believe in scamming people under the pretense that they believe in aliens.
[2:32:33] <+ghostfaceninja_> conspiracy theories are very addicting for some

[2:35:46] <%Graxe_> Where's that DMC5 alignment chart
[2:35:52] <stardustcrusad3r> vergil gets no hoes
[2:35:53] <Solidnick18> LUL
[2:35:53] <lazerscraper> jackpot in every game BUT reboot and 2
[2:35:58] <%FuqBoiSlim> "I don't 'play, Dante. I hang out." - Vergil, age 6
[2:36:00] <Vyneci> And then it turns out HE SAYS IT HIMSELF
[2:36:01] <huskarl_zap> H F O
[2:36:06] <velgaduere> "I have no such recollection"
[2:36:07] <%yeknomlive> maybe it was originally vergil's and dante stole it
[2:36:14] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> big tsun
[2:36:16] <bazz_tv> yeah Dante said Jackpot at the end of 1
[2:36:18] <andrewofbob> He does it in crossover games
[2:36:19] <huskarl_zap> He doesnt like it cause it makes the coom
[2:36:19] <%yeknomlive> and now he's like no dont say it that's my catch phrase
[2:36:30] <Monkeyweed21> The secret is that Vergil is WAY more of a manchild than Dante
[2:36:31] <+marlborored5> vergil, the ultimate tsundere
[2:36:38] <Ranryu692> is Vergil the lamest cool villain?
[2:36:44] <%Graxe_> SDT Judgment Cut targets three at once per JC
[2:36:49] <bazz_tv> how about you get that ex provocation
[2:37:03] <%Graxe_> So you chain all four of them, it hits twelve times
[2:37:07] <$RayDaug> There's nothing more childish than thinking your too cool to be childish
[2:37:08] <lazerscraper> vergil is still as mass murderer
[2:37:08] <%FuqBoiSlim> if vergil was fully human he'd be a fucking mess tbh
[2:37:08] <floralkami> imagine if the Jackpot thing was Dante copying his brother as a kid, and Vergil getting embarrassed
[2:37:09] <witchdoctorpinkish> He just wants his power,absolute BOWER
[2:37:16] <%FuqBoiSlim> wait a min...

[2:39:52] <+ghostfaceninja_> @floralkami, I'm talking about personality, not skill
[2:39:52] <Monkeyweed21> its 3rd strike parry that lets you melt health bars

[2:41:46] <floralkami> @ghostfaceninja_ just like his personality in a normal ass human? oh yeah, of course. they'd have to at least be able to do some genuine draw blade techniques to earn that right.
[2:42:01] <+ghostfaceninja_> I'm just not a fan of Sasuke type characters
[2:42:05] <@akuda_bar> the real trivia: what happens if you only press the xxx and the yyy
[2:42:13] <floralkami> me neither
[2:42:14] <shmo7707> the effects on mirage edge are so cool

[2:42:29] <%FuqBoiSlim> you don't like Visual kei artists?

[2:43:11] <+TheShisno> SO yeah remember when Pat said the style ranking was an efficiency meter? This what it really is. It's a reward system for not being wacky woohoo pizza man
[2:43:12] <lazerscraper> has reggie never played a dmc before this?
[2:43:13] <Applecannon63> Man I really do hope Nero gets to use the Darkslayer Style by using the mirrage ver. of the Yamato
[2:43:13] <Djinnazz> this Reggies first exposure to DMC? pretty sure it's not.
[2:43:15] <%Graxe_> Then it's ammo
[2:43:16] <+DomunDomunDomun> It's pronounced rorbs.
[2:43:18] <%Frubblord> has reggie never played a dmc game before? genuinely asking out of curiosity
[2:43:20] <andrewofbob> If you suck, send them on revives
[2:43:26] <andrewofbob> Spend*
[2:43:26] <Uselesswhitenoise> never never
[2:43:27] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Vergil isn't the only one who has to retain concentration
[2:43:28] <Valdorick> The V trigger; depleted
[2:43:31] <@Menitta> JCCs also increase concentration like crazy
[2:43:39] <%yeknomlive> i think reggie knowledge is from umvc3
[2:43:43] <Triplicat> yes
[2:44:07] <%Gamefriendly> down trick lets you cancel it
[2:44:12] <floralkami> it's not that you haven't played one, what we're surprised about is that you've never SEEN DMC gameplay till now
[2:44:26] <Applecannon63> Like how wild if Nero used the the mirrage ver. Yamato and just try to follow Vergil's or Dante's Dark Slayer Style
[2:44:28] <lazerscraper> D
[2:44:30] <lazerscraper> R
[2:44:33] <lazerscraper> I
[2:44:34] <%Graxe_> Yeah, distortion's not in 5
[2:44:44] <%Graxe_> You still get the DT power boost, though
[2:44:47] <%Frubblord> it does come as a bit surprising considering the company he keeps around. glad he is getting into it now
[2:44:52] <+ghostfaceninja_> btw, in video games/fiction, I love iaito characters, its the most elegant precise way to destroy an opponent
[2:44:53] <bazz_tv> Distostion is dmc4 exclusive
[2:44:59] <Applecannon63> more like Dragon Breaker
[2:45:03] <+TheShisno> Purple Haze Distortion
[2:45:10] <spawnzie> It's a glitch where DT resets the move
[2:45:15] <lazerscraper> how did dri even work
[2:45:26] <%0rond> I love it so much that it's a super real name not made by a designer or writer, and describes it perfectly, and it's STILL SO SICK
[2:45:29] <Uselesswhitenoise> oh and the red orb question. It buys moves
[2:45:29] <%0rond> IT WAS MEANT TO BE
[2:45:35] <Djinnazz> in 3 it was the DT explosion.
[2:45:42] <floralkami> how did that name come to be?
[2:45:51] <%0rond> it's literally what happens
[2:45:56] <MAX116030> Its kinda weird to see Reggie being clueless about DMC series because I always thought Woolie is a person who keeps talking about DMC
[2:45:58] <%0rond> when it's activated it distorts the model
[2:45:59] <Triplicat> real impact is the name of the move and the thing causes a distorted graphical effect
[2:46:18] <+TheShisno> Does Vergil get to make Furies cry?
[2:46:30] <hassanico2> What are these Nelo knockoffs called? Pseudo Angelo and....?
[2:46:34] <%Graxe_> God, DMD Proto Angelos
[2:46:38] <+TheShisno> Proto Angelo
[2:46:38] <%0rond> scudo
[2:46:40] <SomeDudeDrawing> A mirror match I see Kappa
[2:46:42] <hassanico2> Ah proto
[2:46:49] <floralkami> huh, I wonder how they worked around implementing that move into this game, graphical "glitch" and all.
[2:46:54] <+Zeroblazex> The triple is so much easier in the air imo
[2:46:55] <Triplicat> they didn't
[2:46:56] <lazerscraper> but is the insane dri damage in 4 a glitch with popping dt?
[2:46:58] <Triplicat> it's not in this game
[2:47:14] <%Graxe_> DMD reduces your damage by half and the super mode Proto Angelos have also cuts damage by half and it stacks
[2:47:15] <+TheShisno> And yeah, in-canon prototype Nelo Angelos
[2:47:26] <floralkami> @triplicat wait, doesn't... isn't there a version of that with Dante?
[2:47:28] <hassanico2> I hate looking at this thing
[2:47:29] <Applecannon63> Seriously think Nero could use that Yamato again but its mirrage ver. he used in DT Showdown and what if Nero had absorbed the legendary Sparda he get his own Sin DT?
[2:47:30] <%FuqBoiSlim> based behemoth
[2:48:05] <%0rond> Proto Angelos on DMD are crazy
[2:48:10] <floralkami> @triplicat I could have sworn there was a DRI moment in the Woolievs playthrough
[2:48:13] <%Graxe_> Spiral Swords, Blistering Swords, Storm Swords, Heavy Rain Swords
[2:48:32] <KnivesEve> is this the SE or the spite edition?
[2:48:34] <%0rond> that last quarter of health on a DMD proto angelo is as long as a berserk hiatus
[2:48:36] <lazerscraper> doesnt dmd proto armor stack on top of red mode armor?
[2:48:39] <KnivesEve> wait nvm
[2:48:40] <%Graxe_> Yep
[2:48:59] <+DizzyGunner> you dont have eveything unlocked?
[2:48:59] <%Graxe_> So then you do 25% of your base damage when they do that in DMD
[2:49:06] <+TheShisno> I dout Nero could get an SDT cause he's only quarter demon but he makes up for it with the Saiyan one drop rule of being more human makes him potentially more powerful
[2:49:07] <%Graxe_> And the fight drags
[2:49:12] <Djinnazz> Wish he still had his DT refill taunt in 3.
[2:49:19] <+TheShisno> doubt*
[2:49:19] <%0rond> I mean vergil got an SDT just cause
[2:49:26] <lazerscraper> @graxe_ beefy boy indeed
[2:49:28] <floralkami> @applecannon63 no, his Son DT would come from his own blade, as per the tradition of Dante and Vergil
[2:49:36] <floralkami> *Sin DT
[2:49:39] <%0rond> but the issue is that red queen is not a demonic sword
[2:49:53] <+TheShisno> Vergil just has the SDT cause he needs a proper gauge for his mirage blades
[2:49:53] <@Moobot> Enjoying the stream? Follow Woolie at https://twitter.com/WoolieWoolz for updates and other stuff
[2:50:01] <floralkami> @0rond is it not? hmmmmmmmmm??
[2:50:03] <+TheShisno> And doppelganger timer
[2:50:05] <Applecannon63> I mean the devil bringer is technically his devil weapon
[2:50:07] <+hotrockcandy> I can't believe they brought back the Nobodies from DMC 1.
[2:50:10] <+ghostfaceninja_> yea Nero needing SDT is like Jiren needing super saiyan. He's got is own thing going that's just as good
[2:50:22] <%0rond> the devil bringer is his weapon, and it unlocked his true DT
[2:50:23] <Afterman_> @floralkami no..nero made it. it's human made
[2:50:27] <+hotrockcandy> Only thing is that they don't do the laugh. I wish they did. \
[2:50:28] <lazerscraper> of all the other enemies to bring back, why the ficking nobodies
[2:50:31] <nevan_44> nasty boys
[2:50:43] <Vyneci> THE BOI
[2:50:45] <chaos2frozen> Nobodies are tough
[2:50:48] <%0rond> nero's got his stand he don't need a DT
[2:50:50] <chaumiester> Fuck this red guy in particular.
[2:50:50] <floralkami> @afterman_ I know, I'm just screwing with a potential headcanon
[2:50:51] <@Solidus_113> Reggie should know that completed taunts around enemies give 1 bar of DT
[2:50:55] <+TheShisno> RRRRRGH THESE ASSHOLES
[2:50:56] <CrimsonContrast> How's it going? Good luck Woolz
[2:51:08] <+TheShisno> Bro he schmoovin
[2:51:12] <+hotrockcandy> They are. Would have been nice if they brought back Shadow.
[2:51:14] <Djinnazz> BITCH
[2:51:20] <%FuqBoiSlim> they should've brought back those chess piece looking things from 3 to really fuck w people tbh
[2:51:20] <floralkami> @afterman_ considering the organization it was made by, you know
[2:51:26] <hassanico2> So: Furies or Blitzes?
[2:51:29] <%Graxe_> Yeah, Shadows would've been cool to bring back
[2:51:30] <bazz_tv> fastest way to kill a fury is parries
[2:51:30] <%0rond> the chess pieces are such a deep pull
[2:51:38] <Applecannon63> So does that mean Nero has to fist himself to unlock SinDT or a variation?
[2:51:42] <Vyneci> Stage 80 until 101 all enemies starting using Devil Trigger
[2:51:42] <%Graxe_> But V got Shadow, so it's there
[2:51:44] <%FuqBoiSlim> @hassanico2 Which are worse? Blitzes for me
[2:51:48] <lazerscraper> shadow as a regular enemy type instead of boss version would be fine if theyre this version
[2:51:52] <Vyneci> AND firing Dr. Faust
[2:51:56] <+hotrockcandy> Look at it's swole behind trying to run away, lol.
[2:51:57] <lazerscraper> not the balls hard ai one in 1
[2:52:08] <Jaller101514> and ammo for Dantes hat
[2:52:09] <%yeknomlive> flitz's are the worst
[2:52:10] <nevan_44> LUL
[2:52:14] <%yeknomlive> blitz
[2:52:14] <Sol_Install> the best taunt in the game
[2:52:22] <spawnzie> btw if you EX taunt against Dante he does his own
[2:52:33] <hassanico2> I remember when Woolie ran into his first blitz in the DMC4 Bloody Palace... last year I think?
[2:52:41] <Djinnazz> V does.
[2:52:41] <ZeeJiggle> V sorta does.
[2:52:42] <hassanico2> Just seeing that damn thing is harrowing
[2:52:42] <spawnzie> yes
[2:52:43] <@Solidus_113> V does technically
[2:52:51] <%Graxe_> V does, but it's only targeted
[2:52:51] <+ghostfaceninja_> who needs teleports when you got snatch
[2:52:52] <velgaduere> V teleports to enemies to finish them
[2:52:55] <Vyneci> V technically has one
[2:53:09] <%FuqBoiSlim> V's teleport is so ass lol
[2:53:11] <velgaduere> if you're good you can use the finisher port strategically
[2:53:14] <floralkami> I would love for Nero's "Sin DT" to be something tech based, or if his form changed depending on his gauntlet
[2:53:22] <Vyneci> And if the enemy is too heavy, he pulls himself into them
[2:53:25] <prime_name> Love V's playstyle
[2:53:30] <%Graxe_> Hi Goliath
[2:53:34] <Applecannon63> I wish they explored Nero's arm absorbing mechanic
[2:53:36] <Vyneci> THE CAMERA GOING INSANE LUL
[2:53:37] <TheVoltStrike> or he drags him to them, sorta similar
[2:53:44] <+Weirdpixel> NANI He's so fast!
[2:53:46] <lazerscraper> anybody remember the marionettes with the shotguns
[2:53:53] <floralkami> @applecannon63 exactly
[2:54:10] <scrublord009> When's Reggie goes through DMC series?
[2:54:24] <+TheShisno> *reaper horn*
[2:54:45] <Vyneci> 1 sec of SSS PogChamp
[2:54:45] <%FuqBoiSlim> Nero's Sin DT should give him an organic arm canon like Jagaaaaan or something
[2:54:50] <breezysilver> I can never fully hear what vergil says after that move
[2:54:52] <auraofdawn> goliath is so fun to bully
[2:55:02] <Tampaoster> WTF
[2:55:08] <biomegabear> the reward for knowing how to play V
[2:55:09] <Applecannon63> like what was insane about the devil bringer is that it absorb demon related artifacts/weapons like his devil breakers
[2:55:13] <%0rond> it's a bit weird that they didn't bring back fausts, I know they would clash with the sin scissors design wise, but with the faust hat making an appearance it feels weird
[2:55:14] <%0rond> @WoolieVersus you need to spam attack after the triangle>triangle>pause>triangle>triangle. please it's my favorite combo
[2:55:16] <Tampaoster> V can appear in virgils play
[2:55:19] <+Weirdpixel> I think Vergil turning into Urizen and doing a big laser attack would have been a cooler move
[2:55:23] <floralkami> Nero's Sin DT should give him a full mecha stand
[2:55:32] <Applecannon63> -unlock his abilities
[2:55:38] <%Gamefriendly> @scrublord009 word, a Reggie VS Demon Souls is gonna be great but him vs a DMC would be great too
[2:55:43] <floralkami> like his original DT
[2:55:56] <scrublord009> Nero sin DT: I GIVE YOU MY STAND
[2:55:59] <Monkeyweed21> @floralkami Nero's SDT would be him and the stand both in DT
[2:56:12] <+TheShisno> Nero's SDT: The Stand gets a breaker
[2:56:26] <%FuqBoiSlim> He get TWO Stands
[2:56:28] <TheVoltStrike> Nero's SDT is yet another pair of arms
[2:56:28] <+ondri21> ITS TIME?!?
[2:56:29] <%CokeMilkRequiem> CokeMilkRequiem subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! IM BACHK
[2:56:38] <floralkami> all his moves become grabs
[2:56:38] <%Irridium> Nero's SDT: One of those sticky rubber hands but real big
[2:56:42] <Applecannon63> Nero Sin or I would dub it Blessing DT just return of his stand but its based off of Angelo Credo
[2:56:44] <+Weirdpixel> MEATY hits
[2:56:45] <+TheShisno> He becomes a Level 20 Echo Knight Fighter

[3:00:03] <bazz_tv> pun
[3:00:10] <DatAsuna> tbh vergil/dante and v's themes all suck even with the full layers
[3:00:12] <+ghostfaceninja_> hopefully Woolie will implement predictions, the channel does have a heavy focus on fighting games after all
[3:00:17] <+TheShisno> Man, Furies are just as annoying it seems
[3:00:18] <auraofdawn> this is just the "kill fury" move huh
[3:00:19] <%FuqBoiSlim> He tries to teleport away but just get slashed up
[3:00:23] <Applecannon63> oh god what if the stand for Nero's DT is just his own Savior kinda like how Bayonetta summoned a giant infernal demon?
[3:00:26] <+ChrisAlgoo> triple JC is so hard, easier in the air (for me at least)
[3:00:45] <Applecannon63> like Nero goes full Bayo
[3:00:50] <olwe123> could you imagine if Vergil had a RG
[3:01:04] <MAX116030> Fury is annoying but its not damn blitz from DMC4. I HATED him.
[3:01:08] <%FuqBoiSlim> Nero just gets a giant robo like that one in Bayo 2
[3:01:12] <%Lou_Zer> oof
[3:01:24] <lazerscraper> vergils block should have been a true RG
[3:01:30] <%Zayasu> woolieKICKDAD_SG
[3:01:50] <floralkami> I like how y'all just took my Nero with a full mecha suit sdt idea
[3:02:03] <+ChrisAlgoo> wish vergil had lines when he fights one of these nelo looking guys
[3:02:04] <floralkami> from earlier
[3:02:09] <%FuqBoiSlim> Blitz are the worse because they just straight stop the fight and tell you "✋ Halt, you can't hit me anymore."
[3:02:13] <%Lou_Zer> that probably felt pretty good to do
[3:02:26] <Applecannon63> honestly wouldn't Nico just give Nero a mech suit?
[3:02:32] <%FuqBoiSlim> @floralkami Hey, man. finders keepers
[3:02:33] <mattymcfilth> like the sweatshirt woolie REPRESENT
[3:02:37] <Vyneci> FUCK BLITZ
[3:02:40] <%Lou_Zer> Blitz were the worst
[3:02:42] <Vyneci> ALL MY HOMIES HATE BLITZ
[3:02:49] <%Lion_kun> what happened to Mario?
[3:02:53] <Applecannon63> I mean she made him that arm so why not have her build Nero a mechsuit
[3:02:59] <spawnzie> i actually liked blitz
[3:03:01] <%Graxe_> Shadows had the same gimmick as Blitzes
[3:03:01] <xxterminatorviixx> Oh fuck blitz
[3:03:01] <%Irridium> Blitz was annoying as fuck but it was a sick design
[3:03:02] <olwe123> your gonna use it and its a work of ART!
[3:03:05] <+charp35> Fury is better than blitz
[3:03:07] <floralkami> @fuqboislim you wanna find this knuckle sandwich I dropped?
[3:03:10] <%Graxe_> They just didn't teleport around everywhere like Blitzes
[3:03:13] <%FuqBoiSlim> @lion_kun Crashed into a Blanka statue. Rest in Piece bud

[3:03:46] <lazerscraper> c4sageJackpot
[3:03:53] <floralkami> Nico could give Nero an update on Red Queen
[3:03:54] <%Lion_kun> Will he redeem himself for his failure from DMC4?

[3:04:05] <chaos2frozen> 4 supers, if you count V trigger
[3:04:07] <+The_monster_hunter> the visual design of the settings the worst part of 5 but everything else is cool imo
[3:04:10] <MAX116030> @FuqBoiSlim and when you able to hit Blitz ASSHOLE has so much health where you have to cheat with Nero and Dante but Vergil had no cheat so you double screwed
[3:04:10] <+debilitante> they're not playing turbo are they?

[3:04:40] <Uselesswhitenoise> more blues and reds
[3:04:41] <+TheShisno> Spin2Win
[3:04:50] <+ghostfaceninja_> that taunt has a hitbox?
[3:04:50] <Uselesswhitenoise> its just the Aesthtic they wanted for this game i guess

[3:06:48] <+saltpiggu> vergil is basically just a samsho character
[3:06:54] <Applecannon63> Anyways what if Nico makes and combines Nero's Redqueen with that bike he was originally gonna have but Dante had it instead
[3:07:19] <%FuqBoiSlim> what if Nero had a 2nd gun
[3:07:30] <+ghostfaceninja_> @saltpiggu, Ukyo to be specific
[3:07:30] <Applecannon63> like Nero was gonna have his own Caviller called the Black Emperor
[3:07:32] <kinggum41> Judgement cut always sounded like The Hand to me
[3:07:44] <%Graxe_> Vergil can shoot at any time
[3:07:45] <+TheShisno> Devil Gun Nero
[3:07:47] <%Graxe_> Any time
[3:07:54] <Uselesswhitenoise> nero should grow a demon leg
[3:07:55] <%Graxe_> Because he doesn't have a shoot animation
[3:07:57] <+The_monster_hunter> that pose is the dorkiest shit lol
[3:07:58] <+saltpiggu> @ghostfaceninja_ little bit of of shiki in the teleports
[3:08:29] <%FuqBoiSlim> Vergil does a pose and shouts "OSU!" into the mirror every morning
[3:08:39] <lazyberrry> hey how y'all doin
[3:08:46] <Applecannon63> What vergil ruined fighting games that it gave Max PTSD

[3:10:45] <TreesDontTalk> So I've spent like half my day playing Yakuza 0 on my laptop while the old SBFP LP of it was playing on the TV. I just got turned it off and thought, "whoo boy, where did the time go?"

[3:11:07] <%RyuuAoi> @woolieversus BELIEVE IT! WE HERRE
[3:11:37] <Applecannon63> honestly its disappointing that Vergil doesn't use V cane with the Mirrage Edge
[3:11:43] <Monkeyweed21> I wish I had multiple monitors so I can watch Woolie while playing TWW2
[3:11:46] <%RyuuAoi> Through think and thin blood, WE HERE.
[3:12:05] <%Graxe_> 37 of 101 floors
[3:12:35] <Applecannon63> I mean at least Vergil can use that air taunt which is his own ver. of V'a Royal Forks
[3:12:42] <%RyuuAoi> I gotta clean it up, nut we here and we love you, @woolieversus ! Please don't go!
[3:12:46] <+TheShisno> Besides standing tentacle Urizen, what's the most annoying enemy in 5?
[3:12:54] <andrewofbob> Can Vergil clash and one-shot sin scissors?
[3:13:01] <TreesDontTalk> Has anyone ever just sat and watched compilation videos of LTG ragequitting? I laugh so damn hard.
[3:13:06] <lazerscraper> @theshisno judecas
[3:13:07] <KaironFortressKnight> Just releasing on the flash is even bigger damage
[3:13:10] <+MagiKestral> I'm going to mod the game when this comes to pc so vergil's mirage edge is just V's cane

[3:15:58] <TreesDontTalk> @floralkami Trust me, you won't be disappointed. This man puts the salt on display in a good way
[3:15:58] <+TheShisno> It was a celebration of 1, 3, 4, DmC, and the anime
[3:16:00] <%Irridium> wacky adventures with Nero, Trish, and Lady
[3:16:01] <jorniev> NERO VS DANTE+VIRGIL
[3:16:03] <Uselesswhitenoise> devil may cry 6 sorry
[3:16:04] <+MagiKestral> nero should be the only returning character
[3:16:04] <a_mad_dragon> Dante & Vergil versus Hell
[3:16:11] <floralkami> hopefully the circles of hell?
[3:16:14] <kick13_> dante and vergil KILL hell
[3:16:18] <Applecannon63> yeah the reason why Phantom is not with V cause Manga
[3:16:25] <kick13_> and nero getting his own rival on earth
[3:16:26] <Uselesswhitenoise> Nero has a kid with a new gimmick
[3:16:30] <Kalcom> new thing? no, old thing
[3:16:32] <%Lou_Zer> nero vs mundus returning
[3:16:33] <kinggum41> Dmc6 needs to bring back Sparda
[3:16:38] <Nickdick96> Dante and Vergil vs the limits of the ReEngine
[3:16:39] <%cache_22> What if DMC VI is just Bill and Ted but with Dante and Vergil?
[3:16:42] <+ChrisAlgoo> new thing but you get a bonus Kiryu fight at the end
[3:16:43] <+ghostfaceninja_> look foward to DMC6 in 2028
[3:16:46] <jorniev> what ever happened to that guy... sparda
[3:16:55] <TheVoltStrike> i mean, i guess a new protagonist? Nero is a family man, i imagine he spends most of his time at home
[3:16:59] <Applecannon63> I hope the reason for why we couldn't have Vergil vs Nero perspective is that their planning to have a rematch in dmc6
[3:17:00] <astro_yojimbo> I hope they follow up the Sons of Sparta with the Daughters of Nero.
[3:17:01] <Uselesswhitenoise> Devil May Cry Six you play as a civilian. It's survival horror
[3:17:04] <KaseKaizer> Will they finally make a DMC without Dante? I really doubt it, "featuring Dante from the Devil May Cry series" is a meme when he only appeared in like one non DMC game
[3:17:16] <+TheShisno> Morrison gets a Devil Trigger
[3:17:23] <hassanico2> I do not remember Artemis screaming so much?
[3:17:29] <olwe123> I think its time Woolie goes through DMC again for Reggie
[3:17:31] <hassanico2> Hell I don't remember her scream at all
[3:17:34] <andrewofbob> @uselesswhitenoise You play as Crew Cut from the mission 2 intro
[3:17:34] <+Hitorio> Both Dante and Bayonetta have been in Shin Megami Tensei games. :D
[3:17:39] <jorniev> oh noooo
[3:17:39] <floralkami> naw, give Nero two more games before new protag.
[3:17:41] <spikyhyena> She screams on SoS and higher if you stay too close
[3:17:47] <+Hitorio> Now their Style Penors can touch tips
[3:17:51] <Nickdick96> @olwe123 after he does 2
[3:17:53] <TheVoltStrike> i guess Lady and Trish spin-off?
[3:17:53] <heartlesshealer> wish Reggie could see the intro cutscene for that boss, it's great
[3:18:03] <Uselesswhitenoise> You play as Neors twin daughters

[3:24:10] <+ggbhtg> THE SCHMOVEMENT THO
[3:24:14] <%FuqBoiSlim> NO TRISH SLANDER IN THIS TWITCH CHAT GODDAMNIT
[3:24:18] <+ChrisAlgoo> thank you for referencing radioactive spider sperm I was just about to
[3:24:21] <+ggbhtg> THE SCHMOOVE MENT WAS REAL
[3:24:35] <Kiaayo> remember the rumor that the first dlc for this game would be playable trish, eva, and lucia?
[3:24:39] <+MagiKestral> should I play the lady/Trish campaign in dmc4. only route I haven't yet
[3:24:41] <Applecannon63> Like basically Nero be a better Ed from SFV
[3:24:42] <%Graxe_> The thing about Lady and Trish in 4 is that they just felt too experimental
[3:24:51] <+Hitorio> If Lucia was in this game, my expectations would have ACTUALLY been exceeded.
[3:24:52] <+TheShisno> The damage sponges
[3:25:04] <%Ranryu692> Trish's hair has never been modeled well. it always looks awful

[3:25:42] <+treewut> I love how in dt when using gilgamesh it looks like he has bird talons
[3:25:43] <Uselesswhitenoise> combine the female characters into one. Instead of Style switching you switch between ladies
[3:25:47] <%Lou_Zer> the exploding eyes are annoying
[3:25:50] <+Hitorio> I don't think we've seen Lady and Trish fight in these graphics yet. Am I mistaken, or was all we saw... them getting ragdolled by Urizen? LUL
[3:25:54] <scrublord009> Next game should a spinoff. Let Lady and Trish and Nero take on a case.
[3:25:55] <+Mahbonk> Good morning, 47

[3:25:57] <TheVoltStrike> @Uselesswhitenoise TAG DMC? NOW WE'RE TALKING
[3:25:59] <%FuqBoiSlim> Remember when DMC was a horror game LUL
[3:26:03] <Balay123> If there'll ever be a Ladies' Night, Lucia should be included\
[3:26:09] <hassanico2> I have noticed a very distinct lack of Angelos so far?
[3:26:11] <jorniev> true
[3:26:18] <%reknownblackcat> Is this PC?
[3:26:21] <+ChrisAlgoo> give kyrie a gun
[3:26:23] <scrublord009> CAN WE FIX LUCIA? PogChamp
[3:26:25] <+Hitorio> Imagine Lucia talking like Mistral from MGR
[3:26:26] <cybergeek11235> @FuqBoiSlim we don't talk about 2 here
[3:26:27] <Uselesswhitenoise> ps5
[3:26:28] <%Zayasu> ps5
[3:26:30] <+ggbhtg> don't wanna let the big one get any blood th-
[3:26:34] <%FuqBoiSlim> @hitorio i think you kinda saw them fight in Dante's first mission but thats it
[3:26:35] <+ggbhtg> dang it
[3:26:35] <jorniev> lucia should totally show up again
[3:26:41] <gordieda20> YEEEEEE
[3:26:41] <Applecannon63> I wonder if we could have a Nero Lady dynamic cause both of them shit fathers
[3:26:42] <KnivesEve> how many stages are there in this Bloody Palace
[3:26:45] <Darkred28> FORSAKEN I AM AWAKENED
[3:26:46] <kick13_> hey don't you find strange how capcom jumped from dmc 1 to 3? do they even know how to count?
[3:26:47] <scrublord009> 101
[3:26:48] <neroforte177> @Balay123 *squints* WHO??
[3:26:48] <+TheShisno> Lucia but with a real accent
[3:26:49] <%Irridium> 101
[3:26:53] <floralkami> @reknownblackcat ps5. pc is Spite Edition
[3:27:00] <%reknownblackcat> Nice it looks good
[3:27:01] <Applecannon63> like Lady becomes Nero's partner
[3:27:07] <+Hitorio> In Dante's first mission, they stood around, then leapt away when the first enemy approached them. The trailer was a liiiiitle bit deceptive
[3:27:09] <kick13_> lucia is a trish clone Kappa
[3:27:16] <+AnthraxJohnson> What floor is this?
[3:27:18] <cybergeek11235> @kick13_ are you suggesting that capcom stole the 3s from valve?
[3:27:26] <Djinnazz> 46
[3:27:27] <+TheShisno> YO THAT SOUND LAYERING
[3:27:28] <+ChrisAlgoo> DMC6 the quest for mmmmother
[3:27:31] <+Hitorio> Lucia's got those cat-like assassin flexibility acrobat moves and fights with daggers
[3:27:34] <Djinnazz> err 48
[3:27:41] <+AnthraxJohnson> @djinnazz thanks
[3:27:42] <+ggbhtg> Woolie knows about doing multiple supers during SDT, right?
[3:27:43] <+Hitorio> and her Devil Trigger is sick
[3:28:05] <KnivesEve> @kick13_ they're better at valve, cant even get to the number 3 with them
[3:28:06] <DublinRage> I thought the leak for next DMC games are a spin-off Switch Port: DMC:Agni and Rudra versions
[3:28:08] <floralkami> I keep forgetting Lucia has a dt
[3:28:11] <Uselesswhitenoise> DMC 6 should give Dante every single weapon he ever had
[3:28:20] <cybergeek11235> i already DID THAT JOKE KNIVES >_<
[3:28:22] <+ghostfaceninja_> there should totally be a way to skip floors, like with paying in health or rorbs, 101 floors takes SO long
[3:28:26] <+MagiKestral> lucia in a good game would be cool
[3:28:41] <+The_monster_hunter> these are by far the most annoying enemies in the game for me
[3:28:42] <nevan_44> monkaS
[3:28:46] <+Hitorio> Plus, she has my favorite hairstyle.. .and the purple lipstick she's got going on
[3:28:49] <a_mad_dragon> SOR-SOR-SOR-SOR
[3:28:52] <floralkami> chat made that joke already, Reg
[3:28:53] <jubejube56> Seems like a good time to screw the rules
[3:28:54] <Balay123> Lucia had an amazing DT, first time an Angelic-like form was seen
[3:28:58] <Balay123> Next was Credo
[3:29:01] <KaironFortressKnight> why isn't he using the other super moves?
[3:29:01] <kick13_> a good game couldn't save trish much less is gonna save lucia Kappa
[3:29:05] <spikyhyena> as someone who has bear BP in 5 as the other 3, i know these stages basically from memory
[3:29:10] <Applecannon63> what if they return the DMC2 choppers and tanks but they have demons riding on them?
[3:29:11] <gordieda20> We LIVING
[3:29:15] <%FuqBoiSlim> @kick13_ blocked and reported. enjoy your ban
[3:29:16] <spikyhyena> stage 50 sucks

[3:29:50] <+AnthraxJohnson> Can he get any health back in this?
[3:29:54] <+Hitorio> DMC2 isn't in the far future any more, though. By relegating it to happening before DMC4, it lost a lot of its impact for me.

[3:30:14] <+charp35> 2 remake would be cool if they tried to fix it
[3:30:14] <%FuqBoiSlim> If they're gonna start remaking DMC games id rather they start at the beginning
[3:30:16] <%Zayasu> bring back gloria BibleThump
[3:30:20] <Applecannon63> isn't Devil May Cry 3 the pinnacle of battle technically a remake?
[3:30:21] <churropoppa> I was just talking about my family's crest being a demon of death :(
[3:30:30] <spikyhyena> Stage 70 smiley face
[3:30:32] <+Hitorio> Gloria's body language was extraaaa as fuck
[3:30:36] <gordieda20> Big heal
[3:30:51] <+ggbhtg> Gloria was extraaaa as fuck
[3:30:54] <Applecannon63> Gloria is just Trish blackface
[3:30:58] <%FuqBoiSlim> DMC2 Remake would have to be a different game tbh. There's a lot of factors to why that game was mid as hell
[3:31:10] <LeeOhX> @Applecannon63 but I want the ps5 juices pumped into it
[3:31:15] <spawnzie> Woolie ignoring the goat
[3:31:15] <Balay123> Does that mean Trish has the n-pass
[3:31:25] <Darkred28> DESTINY CHASING TIME

[3:31:29] <jorniev> WHENS the mod of vergil holding sweet surrender instead of neros arm!?

[3:31:31] <TheVoltStrike> it's ok
[3:31:32] <KaseKaizer> Kreygasm

[3:32:17] <+Hitorio> Rodin actually says "I'm 'bout dat life" when you Pure Platinum with him in Bayo 2.

[3:42:00] <KaseKaizer> YOOOOOO
[3:42:16] <+ghostfaceninja_> isn't this boss technically a "she" cause its Trish?
[3:42:18] <+Hitorio> Imagine if Nero and Kyrie's phone convo was multiple choice and determined whether or not you could do her Social Link post-game.
[3:42:20] <%Lou_Zer> @monkeyweed21 it is hard to be fair

[3:43:02] <%Lou_Zer> doodOK
[3:43:06] <prime_name> What does Vergil say when he switches back from V?
[3:43:09] <+Hitorio> V implied that this demon was a pre-existing type of its own, but Dante was talking to it as if its fighting style was directly inspired by Trish. Hmmm
[3:43:10] <%jinking79> ah Should've kept in on him
[3:43:13] <%RyuuAoi> Woolie! We in here! Never too much! Never too much! Never too much! - Luther V
[3:43:22] <crimsonsaens> Is this fight one of Vergil's harder bosses? It doesn't seem like he has good moves to parry with (other than Moonsault).
[3:43:31] <+Hitorio> @prime_name something like... you and I coming from the same root, I think?
[3:43:41] <Afterman_> them wangs be wangin
[3:43:45] <DeebzNutz100> I think the v transformation is useless against bosses
[3:43:47] <re0killer> its woolie
[3:43:52] <Vyneci> YEYEYEYE CLASHES
[3:43:52] <%Lou_Zer> OOOOOO
[3:43:52] <+Hitorio> Maximillian_Dood was parrying this knight pretty consistently
[3:44:07] <PrinceOfEden> I'm kinda sad that Vergil doesn't have a base DT form
[3:44:07] <ketchuo13> He has good moves, helm breaker and the divekick are good ways to clash
[3:44:10] <PrinceOfEden> but I get it
[3:44:22] <+Hitorio> BWOOOMMMM
[3:44:25] <@Menitta> I think having Doppleganger is way cooler
[3:44:27] <Vyneci> PogChamp
[3:44:29] <%FuqBoiSlim> Woolie getting good mileage outta Lunar Phase
[3:44:29] <+ggbhtg> @Hitorio Neat. Bloody Palace is a different difficulty
[3:44:54] <KaironFortressKnight> Woolie, just don't get hit.
[3:45:04] <kick13_> do combo
[3:45:05] <+Hitorio> @ggbhtg Does Bloody Palace make some of this Knight's moves unparriable where they'd be parriable on LDK?
[3:45:06] <%FuqBoiSlim> Doppelganger is literally DmC's sole positive impact send tweet

[3:45:22] <OkamiDude15> did woolie do the dante fight and get his ass blown out by a royal release?
[3:45:25] <+marlborored5> @WoolieVersus you should look at vergil's ex provocation

[3:45:40] <+Hitorio> @ggbhtg and for clarification, I was responding to a fellow who was asking about whether Vergil could parry Knight
